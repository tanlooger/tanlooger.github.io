第一章


故事发生在曼纳庄园里。这天晚上，庄园的主人琼斯先生虽然已经锁好了鸡棚，但是由于他喝得酩酊大醉，竟忘了关上里面的那些小门。他提着马灯摇摇晃晃地穿过院子，马灯发出的光也随着一直不停地摇曳。到了后门，他踢脱了两只靴子，又从洗碗间的酒桶里倒出最后一杯啤酒，咕嘟咕嘟地喝了个精光，然后这才躺到床上。此时，床上的琼斯夫人已是鼾声如雷了。



等到卧室里的灯光一熄灭，一阵扑扑腾腾的声音马上席卷整个庄园。有一件事，还在白天的时候，就已经在庄园中四处流传了：说是老少校，也就是那头得过“中等白鬃毛”奖的公猪，在前一天夜里做了一个奇怪的梦，想要讲述给别的动物听。当时，大家都已经商定，一旦琼斯先生完全不会再来打扰，所有的动物就立即都到大谷仓内集合。老少校（大家一直这么称呼他，尽管当年他参加展览时用的是“威灵顿帅哥”这个名字）在庄园里一直德高望重，所以每一只动物都十分乐意牺牲一小时的睡眠时间，来聆听他准备讲的事情。

大谷仓一头有一个隆起的台子，少校已经安坐在那铺了干草的一个垫子上了。从房梁上悬挂而下的一盏马灯就在他头顶上方。他已经度过了十二个春秋，近来有些发福，但他依然是一头相貌堂堂的猪。尽管事实上他的犬牙从来没有被锯短过，这也并不妨碍他俨然一位慈祥睿智的老者模样。不到一会儿工夫，剩余的动物们也陆续赶来，并按各自不同的习惯安坐了。最先进场的是三条狗，分别叫做蓝铃铛、杰西和钳子。紧随其后走进来的几头猪立即把营寨驻扎在了台子前面的稻草上。一些母鸡就栖在窗台上，几只鸽子则扑腾腾飞上了房梁。羊和牛在猪身后躺下，开始倒嚼起来。两匹拉二轮货车的马，一匹叫拳师，另一匹叫苜蓿，齐头并进，他们进来时走得非常慢，巨大的毛茸茸的蹄子总是小心翼翼地落下每一步，生怕有什么小动物在干草堆中藏着似的。苜蓿是一匹粗壮而母性十足的雌马，快到中年了。在生育四匹马驹后，她再也没能恢复昔日的体形样貌。拳师则硕大无朋，差不多有六英尺高，强壮得顶得上两匹普通的马。不过，一道顺着鼻梁生出的白毛，使他多少显得有点傻里傻气。实际上，他确实没有超群绝伦的智商，但他坚韧不拔的品格和干活时干劲十足的表现，还是为他赢得了普遍的尊敬。随两匹马之后到的是白山羊穆丽尔，以及那头被称为本杰明的驴子。本杰明是庄园里最年长的动物，脾气非常古怪。他很少讲话，不开口则已，一旦开口就会来一通不冷不热的怪论。比如他会说：上帝给了他尾巴是用来驱赶苍蝇的，但是他却宁愿尾巴和苍蝇都不要。庄园里的动物中，只有他从来不苟言笑。假如被问到为什么会这样，他会说他看不出来有什么值得好笑的东西。不过，尽管没有公开承认，他对拳师却还是心悦诚服的。他俩总是一块儿到果园远处的一小块牧场上去消磨星期天，肩并着肩吃草，可就是互不搭理。



现在转回正题。拳师和苜蓿两匹马刚刚趴下，只见一群失去了妈妈的小鸭子鱼贯而入到了大谷仓，他们无力地叫着，左顾右盼，想找一处不至于被踩踏的地方。苜蓿用她粗壮得犹如一堵墙一样的前腿把小鸭子们围住，于是他们就偎依在这围子里面，不一会儿就进入梦乡了。临到最后时分，漂亮的白母马莫丽才进场，这是个相当愚蠢的家伙，是给琼斯先生拉双轮轻便车的。她故作娇态一摇一摆地走了进来，嘴里还嚼着一块方糖。她找了个靠前的位置站着，就开始抖动起她的白色鬃毛卖弄风情，试图吸引大家注意那些扎在鬃毛上的红饰带。最后一个到来的是一只猫。她和往常一样，四处张望着想寻找最热乎的地方，最后愣是从拳师和苜蓿中间挤了进去。在少校发表演讲时，她自始至终都在那里发出轻微的咕噜声以示自己的心满意足，但少校讲的话，她根本一个字也没听进去。

所有的动物都已到场，除了摩西。那是一只驯化了的乌鸦，正在庄主院后门背后的横木架上睡觉。少校看到大家都坐稳了，并全神贯注地等待他发言，便清了清嗓子，开口说道：

“同志们，你们已经听说了我昨晚做了一个奇怪的梦。但是，我想待会儿再谈那个梦。我首先讲点别的事儿。同志们，我恐怕没有多长时间能和你们待在一起了。在我去世之前，我觉得把我已经获得的智慧传给你们是自己应尽的义务。在我漫长的一生中，当我独自躺在圈里的时候，曾有大量的时间沉思，我认为我能够说，如同而今所有活着的动物一样，我参透了一个道理，那就是我们活在世上本该是什么样的。我想要对你们讲的就是这个问题。

“那么，同志们，我们究竟是如何生活的呢？我们还是正视这个问题吧：我们这一生是凄惨、艰辛而短促的。一生下来，我们得到的食物不过仅仅够勉强维持生存。但是，只要我们还有一口气在，我们便会被强迫着去干活，直到把最后一丝气力用完。一旦我们丧失了使用价值，我们就会遭到难以置信的残忍杀戮。在英格兰，没有一个动物在满一岁之后享受过幸福或休闲。英格兰的动物是没有自由可言的。动物的一生是痛苦不堪、备受奴役的一生。这是一个显而易见的事实。

“然而，这完全是与生俱来的吗？那些居住在这里的生灵之所以不能过上体面的生活，难道是因为我们这儿是穷山恶水之地吗？不！同志们！一千个不！英格兰有着肥沃的土地，宜人的气候，它能够提供丰饶富足的食物，可以养活的生灵的数量大大超出如今在此生活的动物总数。单单就我们这一个庄园而言，就完全可以养活十二匹马、二十头牛和数百只羊，而且他们会生活得极其舒适和体面，那是我们目前根本无法想象的。那么，我们为什么一直过着这种凄惨不堪的生活呢？那是因为，我们的所有劳动成果几乎全都被人类从我们身边窃取了。同志们，有一个答案能够指出我们的症结所在，我把它归结为一个字——人。人就是我们仅有的真正的仇敌。只要打倒了人类，导致饥饿和过度劳累的根本原因就可以永远根除了。

“所有生灵中只有人类是不会生产的，他们只会消耗。人不能产奶，也不能下蛋，瘦弱得连犁也拉不动，跑起来也是慢慢腾腾的，连个兔子都抓不住。然而，人却是所有动物的主人，他强迫他们去干活，却只给他们少得不能再少的一点报偿，仅够他们维持生存而已。而他却把他们劳动所得剩余的一切全部占为己有。是我们的劳力在耕耘着这片土地，是我们的粪便给它施肥，可我们自己除了身上的一张皮之外，又捞到了什么呢！你们这些坐在我面前的奶牛，过去的一年中，你们产了数千加仑的牛奶呀！那些本来可以哺育出很多健壮牛犊的奶都到哪儿去了呢？这些奶的每一滴都被我们的仇敌喝掉了。还有你们这些母鸡，过去的一年里你们一共下了多少只蛋呢？这些蛋中间又有多少孵成了小鸡？那些没有孵化的鸡蛋全部被卖到了市场，琼斯和他的伙计们由此换来了大把的钞票。你呢，苜蓿，你生育的四匹马驹到哪儿去了？他们原本是你晚年的依靠和慰藉！然而，他们却都在刚满一岁时就被卖掉了，从此以后，哪一只你都甭想再见到了。除了那份聊以糊口的饲料和一间马厩作为你这四次分娩和一贯的勤劳苦干的回报外，你还得到过什么呢？



“然而，即便是过着这样悲惨的生活，我们也不能被允许自然地走到生命的尽头。拿我自己来说，我没什么可抱怨的，因为我算是运气不错的。我活了十二年了，已经有了四百多个孩子，这才是一头猪合乎自然的生活。但是，没有一个动物最终能逃过那残忍的一刀。就拿你们这些坐在我面前的小肉猪来说吧，不到一年的时间，你们都将在木架上尖声惊叫着丢掉性命。我们都将会遭到如此恐怖的厄运——牛、猪、鸡和羊等等，每一位都难以逃脱。就是马和狗的命运也好不到哪里去。你，拳师，等到你那强健的肌肉失去了原有的力量时，琼斯就会立刻把你卖给收买和屠宰废马的贩子。他们会先把你宰杀了，再把你煮熟了喂猎狐犬。至于狗呢，等他们变老了，没有牙了，琼斯就会在他们的脖子上绑块砖头，把他们沉到最近的池塘里。

“那么，同志们，我们这种生活的苦难完全是由于人类的暴虐统治所造成的，这一点难道不是极其清楚、明白的吗？只要摆脱了人类的统治，我们的劳动成果就会全归我们自己。几乎在一夜之间，我们就会变得富足而自由。那么为此我们应该怎么办呢？毫无疑问，为了推翻人类的统治，必须没日没夜、尽心竭力地工作！同志们，我要传达给你们的就是这个信息：造反！我也不知道那场造反会在什么时候爆发，可能在一周之内，也可能在百年之后。但是我坚信，就像看到我脚下的这些干稻草一样确信无疑，正义总有一天必定要得到伸张。同志们，你们的余生已经日子不多，这个目标一定要牢记在心！最为重要的是，必须把我说的启示传递给你们的后代，这样，未来一代一代的动物就会为这一斗争前赴后继，直到赢取胜利。

“记住，同志们，你们的决心一定不能动摇，决不能让任何虚伪动听的话语把你们引入歧途。要是他们宣扬什么人与动物有着共同的利益，人的兴盛就是动物的兴盛，那全是十足的谎言，千万不要被那种话蒙蔽。人只会为他自己的利益殚精竭虑，而绝不会考虑到任何其他的生灵。我们在斗争中必须团结一致，建立纯粹的同志友谊。所有的人都是我们的仇敌，所有的动物都是我们的同志。”

正在这时，动物中间产生了一阵巨大的骚动。刚才在少校讲话时，有四只个头如斗的老鼠从洞里钻了出来，后腿着地蹲坐在那儿听他演讲。几条狗突然瞧见了他们，幸亏他们一个箭步窜回洞内，性命才得以保住。少校举起前蹄示意大家安静。

“同志们，”他说，“这里有一点必须要弄清楚：非家养的生灵，比如老鼠和兔子，究竟是我们的朋友呢还是仇敌？让我们现在就来表决。我把这个议题提交给大会：老鼠算不算同志？”

动物们当即就进行了表决，同意把老鼠作为同志的占了绝大多数。投反对票的只有四个，即三条狗和一只猫。事后发现，其实猫两边都投了票，包括反对票和赞成票。少校接着说道：

“我也没什么要说的了。我只是再次申明一下，永远牢记你们身上的重任，对待人类及其举止行为要抱着不是你死就是我活的思想。凡是靠两条腿行走的统统是仇敌，凡是靠四肢行走的或者长翅膀的，都是朋友。还有必须牢记的是，在反抗人类的斗争过程中，我们切不可仿效他们。即使你们取得了胜利，也不得继承他们的恶习。任何动物都不允许住在房屋里，不准睡在床上，不准穿衣、喝酒和抽烟，接触钞票和从事交易也是绝对禁止的。人类所有的习惯都是邪恶的。而且，最为重要的是，任何动物都不得残暴地对待自己的同类。不论是瘦弱无力的还是强壮有力的，不论是聪明伶俐的还是愚蠢无知的，我们都是兄弟。动物之间绝不能相互杀戮。一切动物都是平等的。

“同志们，现在我要把昨晚那个梦讲述给大家。那场梦的情景是无法用言语形容的。那是关于未来人类消亡之后的世界将会怎么样的一个梦想。但它让我想起了我遗忘了很久的一些事情。很多年以前，我还是头小猪，我母亲和另外的几头母猪经常哼唱一首老歌——一支甚至连她们也只会哼个曲调和头三句歌词的老歌。小时候我已经很熟悉那些曲调了，但它从我脑海中消失已经很长时间了。没想到昨天晚上，它又在我的梦中出现了。更为绝妙的是，那首歌的歌词也在梦中出现了。可以肯定的是，这就是很久很久以前动物们所唱的歌词，后来失传了很多年。同志们，现在我就想把这首歌唱给你们听。我年纪大了，嗓音也早就沙哑了，不过等我把你们教会了，你们能够唱得更为动听的。歌名叫《英格兰的牲畜》。”



老少校清了一下嗓子，就开始唱了起来。正如他所说的，他声音的确已经沙哑，但他唱得相当不错。那首歌曲调慷慨激昂，旋律有点介于《克莱门汀》和《拉库库拉恰》之间。歌词是这样的：





英格兰的牲畜，爱尔兰的牲畜，

普天之下的牲畜，

都来听我唱一唱，

未来黄金时代的可喜佳音。





这一天早晚要来到，

残暴的人类终将被消灭，

英格兰的肥沃大地，

将由我们纵情驰骋。





穿透我们鼻中的铁环必将消失，

压在我们背上的挽具也将撤离，

嚼子和马刺会永远锈蚀，

无情的鞭子再也不能噼啪作响。





做梦也难以想到的富裕生活，

小麦和大麦，干草和燕麦，

苜宿、大豆还有甜菜，

到那一天全都归我们所有。





到我们获得自由的那一天，

英格兰大地将是光明灿烂的一片，

水会更清澈，

风也吹得你心醉。





为了那一天，我们必须拼命苦干，

即使壮志未酬身先死，

牛和马，鹅和鸡，

为自由就得多流汗。





英格兰的牲畜，爱尔兰的牲畜，

普天之下的牲畜，

都来听我唱一唱，

未来黄金时代的可喜佳音。





这首歌如此一唱，动物们就陷入了狂热的亢奋状态之中。还没有来得及等少校唱完，他们便都自己唱开了。甚至最愚笨的动物也已经学会了曲调和少数几句歌词。至于猪和狗，像他们那样聪明一些的，几分钟内就把整首歌全部装进大脑了。于是，他们经过几次初步的尝试之后，《英格兰的牲畜》就突然间响彻了整个庄园，而且是以惊人一致的大合唱爆发出来的。母牛哞哞地低叫，狗汪汪地长吠，羊的咩咩声、马的嘶鸣声以及鸭子的嘎嘎声，都恰到好处。这首歌把动物们的情绪调动得无比兴奋，以至于一连足足唱了五遍，若不是中途被打断的话，他们极有可能彻夜唱下去。

遗憾的是，吵闹声把琼斯先生给弄醒了。他从床上跳了下来，想确定院子中是不是有狐狸溜了进来。他操起一直放在卧室角落的那杆猎枪，向着黑暗处开了一枪，一颗六号子弹射进了大谷仓的墙里。于是这次集会匆匆忙忙地解散了。动物们纷纷向着自己的窝棚仓皇逃窜。家禽跳上了他们的栖木架，家畜在干草堆中倒卧下来，整个庄园顷刻之间便鸦雀无声了。





第二章


三个夜晚之后，老少校在睡梦中安详地辞世。他的遗体被掩埋在果园脚下。

时值三月初。在接下来的三个月中间，出现了接二连三的秘密活动。少校的一席话使庄园里那些比较有头脑的动物产生了一种全新的生活观念。他们不知道少校所预言的造反什么时候才能爆发，他们也不能确定造反是否会在他们有生之年内发生。但他们无疑清楚，为此进行准备就是他们的义务。教育和组织其他动物的工作，自然就落到了猪的肩上。他们被普遍认为是所有动物中最为聪明的。而其中尤其优秀卓越的是名叫雪球和拿破仑的两头公猪，他们是琼斯先生养着用来卖的。拿破仑是一头长相凶狠、个头庞大的伯克夏公猪，也是庄园中仅有的一只伯克夏种猪，不喜欢夸夸其谈，素以不择手段而闻名。相比之下，雪球要活跃得多，伶牙俐齿，点子也多，但大家认为他与城府较深的拿破仑相比，稍微差了点。庄园里剩余的公猪都是肉用猪。他们中名气最大的是一头名叫声响器的矮小的胖猪。他的面颊滚圆滚圆的，眼珠子忽闪忽闪的，动作灵巧，嗓音尖细。他是个卓越的演说家，特别是在他论证某些难以讲解清楚的论点时，他习惯性的动作就是边讲解边来回跳个不停，同时还把他的尾巴摆动个不停。而那一招不知什么原因就是容易令人信服。别的动物谈起声响器时，都认为他能把黑的说成白的。

这三头猪认真揣摩老少校的训导，把它阐发成为一套完整的思想体系，并给它起了一个“动物主义”的名字。每周总有几个夜晚，等琼斯先生入睡以后，他们就在大谷仓里举行秘密会议，向其他动物详细解释动物主义的原理。起初，他们遭遇到了太多的迟钝和冷漠。这些动物中的一些居然谈到什么对琼斯先生的忠诚的义务（他们还称呼他为“主人”），提出一些非常幼稚的看法，诸如“琼斯先生养活着我们，要是他离开了，我们将会饿死”之类的话语。还有的提出这样一些问题，比如“我们为什么要关心那些在我们死后发生的事情？”或者“如果反叛的爆发是不可避免的，那我们为不为它效力又有什么关系？”因此，为了让他们明白所有这些说法都是背离动物主义精神的，几头猪费了很大的力气。几个最为愚蠢的问题都是那匹白母马莫丽提出来的，她问雪球的第一个问题是：“造反以后还有没有方糖？”

“没有，”雪球斩钉截铁地说。“我们没有办法在庄园制糖。再说，你并不需要糖，而你将会拥有你想要的燕麦和草料。”

“那我还被允许在我的鬃毛上扎饰带吗？”莫丽问。

“同志，”雪球说，“那些你如此朝思暮想的饰带，其实全是奴隶的标记。你难道不明白自由的价值要远远高于饰带吗？”

莫丽表示同意，但听起来并不是心悦诚服。

猪遭遇的更为棘手的事情，是对付驯化了的乌鸦摩西散播的种种谣言。摩西这个琼斯先生特别钟爱的宠物，是个喜欢刺探消息和搬弄是非的家伙，还是个巧舌如簧的说客。他声称他知道有一个叫做蜜饯山的神秘的地方，所有的动物死后都把那里作为归宿。根据摩西的说法，那个神秘的地方就在天空中云层上面的不远的某个地方。摩西说，在蜜饯山，每周七天都是星期天，一年到头都有当令的新鲜苜蓿。方糖和亚麻籽饼就长在树篱上。动物们讨厌摩西，因为他总是散播闲话而不劳动。但是也有一些动物相信蜜饯山，所以，猪不得不费尽唇舌去解释，使动物们明白世界上根本就没有那样的地方。



他们最忠实的信徒是那两匹拉货车的马，拳师和苜蓿。对他们俩来说，靠自己弄明白任何问题都非常困难。不过一旦认定猪作为他们的老师，那么，凡是猪教给他们的一切东西，他们便都能理解吸收了，然后再通过一些简单的论证把这些道理传达给别的动物。他们也从不缺席大谷仓中的秘密集会。而且每当集会结束要唱那首《英格兰的牲畜》时，也照例由他们带头唱起。

形势的发展出人意料，造反竟然实现了，而且比任何一个动物所预期的都要提前很多，也顺利得多。在过去许多年中，琼斯先生尽管是个刻薄的主人，总还称得上是一位能干的庄园主，可是近来却时运不佳。在一场官司中赔了钱以后，他变得非常沮丧，于是拼命地酗酒。有一段时间，他整天窝在厨房里，在他的那把温莎靠椅上懒洋洋地坐着，翻翻报纸，喝喝酒，偶尔把蘸了啤酒的干面包片给摩西喂一点。他的伙计们也游手好闲，不尽心尽力。田地里长满了野草，窝棚顶棚也漏雨失修，树篱无人修剪，动物们很难填饱肚子。

六月临近，差不多到了收割牧草的时节。在施洗约翰节（六月二十四日）的前夕，那天是星期六，琼斯先生去了趟威灵顿，在红狮子酒吧喝得烂醉如泥，直到星期天的正午时分才回来。他的伙计们大清早挤完牛奶，根本没有给动物们添加草料，就外出打野兔去了。而琼斯先生一回来，就躺在客厅沙发上睡着了，一张《世界新闻报》盖在了他的脸上。所以一直到傍晚，还没有人给动物们喂过东西。最终，动物们实在不能忍受了，有一头母牛用角顶开了饲料棚的门，于是，所有的动物蜂拥而上，自行从饲料箱里抢取食物。正在这个时候，琼斯先生醒了。转瞬间，他和他的四个伙计手里拿着鞭子来到了饲料棚，上来就是一阵胡乱抽打。原本一直挨饿的动物们对于这个早已不能忍受。尽管事先毫无任何谋划，动物们竟都不约而同地向这些虐待他们的人猛冲过去。琼斯先生和他的几个伙计忽然发现他们自己正处在四面受敌的境况中，遭到了动物们的角抵蹄踢，局面完全失去了控制。他们以往还从未见到动物有过如此行为，他们对待这一群牲畜一直就是随心所欲地鞭打和虐待。这群牲畜们毫无征兆的暴动把他们吓得几乎魂不附体。不到一会儿工夫，琼斯先生和他的伙计们就放弃自卫的企图，滑脚溜走。又过了一会儿，在动物们所向披靡的追击下，他们五个人全都沿着通往大路的车道拼命逃窜。

琼斯夫人从卧室的窗子望出去，看到了正在发生的这一切，她急忙把一些细软扔进一个毛毡手提包里，从另一条通道溜出了庄园。摩西从他的栖木架上跳起来，拍打着翅膀尾随着琼斯夫人，呱呱地大声乱叫。在此期间，动物们已经把琼斯和他的伙计们赶到外面的大路上，然后砰的一声关上了共有五道闩的大门。就这样，在他们几乎还没有弄清楚发生了什么事时，造反就已经大获全胜了：琼斯被驱逐出庄园了，曼纳庄园完全在他们的掌控之中。



刚开始几分钟，动物们几乎无法相信他们会有这么好的运气。他们做的第一件事就是一起沿着庄园的地界绕场奔跑了一圈，似乎是要完全确定再也没有一个人躲在庄园里了。接着，又奔回窝棚中，把那些可憎的琼斯统治留存下来的一切痕迹清除得一干二净。马厩尽头的马具棚被撞开了，嚼子、鼻环、狗链，以及琼斯先生过去常用来阉割猪羊的那些残暴的刀子，一股脑儿都给扔进了井里。缰绳、笼头、眼罩和有损尊严的吊在马嘴下的饲料袋，统统扔进了院子中正在燃烧的垃圾堆里。鞭子也难以幸免。当动物们看着鞭子在火焰中烧起来时，全都欣喜若狂，欢呼雀跃起来。饰带也被雪球扔进了火堆，那些饰带是以往每逢赶集时扎在马鬃和马尾上用的。



“饰带，”他说道，“应该视同衣服，都是人类的标记。所有的动物都应该赤身裸体。”

拳师一听他这么说，便把他夏天用来防止蝇虫钻入耳朵时戴的一顶小草帽也摘了下来，把它跟别的东西一道扔进了火堆中去。

没用多长时间，动物们便全部销毁了能让他们想起琼斯先生的所有东西。接着，拿破仑率领大伙回到饲料棚里，给每一个动物都分发了双份的谷物饲料，给每一只狗分发了双份饼干。然后，他们把《英格兰的牲畜》从头到尾接连唱了七遍。唱完之后，他们安顿下来舒舒服服地睡了一夜。他们以前还从来没有这样睡过觉。

但他们还是和往常一样在黎明时分醒来。突然想起已经发生的那么显赫的壮举，所有的牲畜全都跑出来，一起冲向大牧场。顺着牧场往前，不远的地方有一座小山包，从那儿可以将大半个庄园的景色一览无余。动物们冲到小山包顶上，在清新的晨曦中俯瞰四周。没错，这是他们的——他们所能看到的一切东西都是他们的！怀着这个念头带来的狂喜，他们一圈又一圈地绕着小山包奔跑跳跃。在汹涌澎湃的极度激动中，他们不时向空中猛蹦乱跳。他们在朝露上打滚，口中塞满了甘美的鲜嫩牧草；他们踢起黑黝黝的一块块泥土，狠狠地吮吸泥块中蕴含着的浓郁的芳香。然后，他们巡视了一遍整个庄园，满怀无言的赞美视察了耕地、牧场、果树园、池塘和树丛，好像他们此前还从未见到过这些东西一样。而且，直到现在，他们还是难以相信这些统统归他们所有。



接下来他们列队返回庄园的窝棚，可是却在农场主的住房外默不作声地站住了。这住房也已经是他们的了，但是他们却惊恐得不敢走到里面去。过了一会儿，雪球和拿破仑用肩把门顶开，动物们才鱼贯而入，但步子迈得非常小心，唯恐把什么惊动了似的。他们踮起蹄子尖从一间房屋走进另一间房屋，一个个噤若寒蝉，用无比敬畏的眼光盯着这些难以置信的奢华——盯着梳妆镜、马鬃沙发和那些用他们的羽绒制成的被褥，以及布鲁塞尔地毯和放在客厅壁炉架上的维多利亚女王的石印画像。当他们心满意足地下楼梯时，却发现莫丽不见了。再返回楼上去找，才发现她仍留在后面一间最好的卧室里。她从琼斯夫人的梳妆台上拿了一条蓝色饰带，对着镜子正在比划着，那副自我陶醉的丑态别提有多愚蠢了。动物们给了她一阵严厉的斥责之后，这才又一起走了出来。挂在厨房里的几只火腿也被拿出去埋掉了，洗碗间的啤酒桶被拳师一蹄子给踢了个洞。除此之外，房屋里其他一切东西连碰都没碰过。现场一致通过了一项决议：农场主的住房应该保留下来作为博物馆。大家全都同意任何动物都不可住在里面。

动物们吃了早餐后，雪球和拿破仑再次把大家召集到一起。

“同志们，”雪球说道，“现在刚六点半，下面还有长长的一整天。今天我们开始收割牧草，但是还有另外一件事情得首先提上议程。”

这时，猪首脑们才透露在过去的三个月中，他们从一本旧的拼音书本上自学了阅读和书写。那本书原本属于琼斯先生的孩子们，后来被扔到垃圾堆里。拿破仑派部下弄来几桶黑漆和白漆，带领大家来到朝向大路的五闩大门。接着，雪球（因为雪球的字写得最好）用蹄子的两个趾头夹起一把刷子，涂掉了大门顶端一道闩上的“曼纳庄园”几个字，又在那上面涂上“动物庄园”。从此以后，这就是庄园的名字。写完以后，大伙又回到窝棚那里，雪球和拿破仑派部下搬来一架梯子，并把梯子靠在大谷仓的墙头。猪首脑们解释说，通过过去三个月的思索，他们已经成功地把动物主义的原则提炼为“七诫”，这“七诫”现在就要题写在墙上，它们将成为一部至高无上的法律，所有动物庄园的动物的生活都必须永远以它为准则。雪球费了很大的周折才爬了上去（因为猪在梯子上很难保持平衡）并开始忙活起来，声响器提着油漆桶站在稍低几格的地方。在涂过柏油的墙上，用巨大的白漆字母写着“七诫”，在三十码以外的地方也看得一清二楚。上面写着：



七　诫

1．凡靠两条腿行走者皆为仇敌；

2．凡靠四肢行走或长翅膀者，皆为朋友；

3．凡动物一律不准穿衣；

4．凡动物一律不准睡床；

5．凡动物一律不准饮酒；

6．凡动物一律不准杀害其他动物；

7．凡动物一律平等。





字迹非常工整，除了把friend（朋友）一词写成了freind，以及其中有一处s写反之外，其他的拼写全部正确。雪球大声朗读全文以便别的动物都能听到，所有动物都频频点头，表示完全赞同。其中较为聪明一些的动物立即开始默记起来。

“现在，同志们，”雪球扔下油漆刷子喊道，“向草料地出发！我们要争得这个荣誉，一定要比琼斯他们一伙人收割得更快。”

好大一会儿前有三头母牛就已经显得很不自在，这时索性哞哞大叫起来。原来她们二十四小时没有被挤奶了，她们的乳房几乎要胀破了。猪稍加考虑之后，让部下取来奶桶，十分成功地给母牛挤了奶，他们的蹄子干这个活倒是得心应手。很快，就装满了五桶冒着泡沫的乳白色牛奶，许多动物怀着浓厚的兴趣盯着奶桶中的奶。

“怎么处理这些牛奶呢？”有一个动物问道。

“琼斯过去有时候在我们的谷糠饲料中掺一些牛奶，”一只母鸡说。

“先把牛奶放在一边，同志们！”挺身而出站在奶桶前的拿破仑大声喊道。“牛奶会被妥善处理的。现在更重要的是收割牧草，雪球同志领你们先去，我马上就到。前进，同志们！牧草在等着呢！”

于是，动物们成群结队地前往草料场开始收割。当他们傍晚收工回来的时候，发现牛奶已经不见了。





第三章


为了把牧草收割起来，他们真不知出了多少力，流了多少汗！不过他们的辛苦还是得到了回报，因为这次丰收大大地超过了他们的预期，是一次巨大的成功。



这些活干起来常常很费力；工具都是为人而不是为动物设计的，没有一个动物会使用那些要求靠两条后腿站着才能操作的工具，这是一个很大的劣势。不过猪十分聪明，他们总能想出办法来解决每一个难题。至于马呢，他们对这些田地的每一寸土地都非常熟悉，实际上，他们对割草和耕地这些事情远比琼斯及其伙计们精通。猪实际上并不干活，只是指挥和监督其他动物。他们凭借出众的学识，顺理成章地承担了领导的工作。拳师和苜蓿自己套上割草机或者马拉耙机（这时候当然压根不用嚼子或缰绳），迈着稳健的步伐，坚定地在地里绕来绕去，猪跟在他们的后面，根据不同情况，吆喝一声“驾，快点，同志！”或者“吁，停下，同志！”在翻检和堆积牧草时，每一只动物，包括最不起眼的在内，无不参与其中。就连鸭子和鸡也整天在大太阳下来来回回忙碌个不停，用他们的嘴巴衔上少得可怜的一小撮牧草。最终，他们完成了收割，比琼斯和他的伙计们以往干活所需的时间整整少了两天。更值得骄傲的是，这是一个庄园里从来没有过的最大的一次丰收。没有一点儿浪费；有着锐利眼光的鸡和鸭，不会放过一根草梗草叶。庄园里甚至没有哪个动物偷吃过一口牧草。

整个夏天，庄园里的工作像时钟一样运转得有条不紊。动物都非常幸福开心，而这一切，是他们从前无法想象的。而今，由于所有食物都是他们自己的，出于他们自身的需要而自己生产，而不是小气的主人施舍给他们的，因而每一口食物都是一种实实在在的享受。尽管动物们的经验不足，但随着毫无价值的、寄生虫般的人被赶走后，每一个动物便有了更多的食物，也有了更多的休闲时间，虽然动物们经验不足。他们遇到过很多困难，但也都迎刃而解。比如，到了下半年收割谷物的时候，由于庄园里没有脱粒机，动物们就采取那种古老的办法，把谷粒踩下来，再靠嘴巴吹去壳。猪的聪明才智和拳师的无穷臂力总能使他们轻易地克服这些困难。拳师成为每一个动物敬佩的对象。即使在琼斯时期，拳师干活就一直非常勤劳并且从不懈怠，如今，他更是一个顶三个。有一段时间，庄园里所有的活计似乎全都落在了他那一双强大有力的肩膀上。从早到晚，他一直拉呀推呀，哪里工作最艰苦，哪里就一定有他。他早就和一只小公鸡约定，让小公鸡每天早晨提前半小时叫醒他，好让他在一天的正式工作开始之前，先干一些志愿活，不管干什么活，只要看起来是最需出力的地方就行。不论遭遇什么困难和挫折，拳师的回答通常就是：“我要更加努力工作！”——这句话已经成了他的座右铭。

每一只动物都只能从事力所能及的劳动，就拿鸡和鸭来说，他们在收获时节单靠捡拾遗落的谷粒，就节约了一百八十升之多的粮食。没有谁偷吃，也没有谁为自己的口粮份额而牢骚满腹，以往生活中那些司空见惯的争吵、咬斗和妒忌也几乎消失殆尽。没有或者说几乎没有动物旷工的。诚然，莫丽对于早晨起床很不适应，她还有一个坏毛病，常常以蹄子里夹了个石子为理由早早地溜走了。猫的表现也多少有点独特——没过多久大家就注意到，每当有活要干的时候，这只猫就无影无踪了。她往往一连几个小时都不见踪影，等到开饭时，或者晚上活都干完后，她才厚着脸皮重新露面。但是每次她的理由总是非常充足，而且咕咕噜噜地说得十分动情，任谁也没法怀疑她良好的本意。老本杰明，就是那头驴，起义后似乎没有丝毫变化。他还是和在琼斯时期一样，慢条斯理、倔强固执地干他自己的活，从不旷工，可也从不自愿干额外的工作。对于造反和造反产生的影响，他从来不发表任何意见。谁要问他既然现在琼斯已经离去他是否比以前更快乐时，他就只说：“驴子都有很长的寿命，你们中间有谁看见过死驴？”听到他那寓意深刻的回答，其他动物只好作罢。

星期天不用工作。早餐比平时晚开一个小时。早餐之后，有一项每周毫无例外都要举行的仪式。首先是升旗。这面旗是雪球在马具室里找到的一块琼斯夫人的绿色旧桌布，在上面用白漆画了一只蹄子和一只犄角。每个星期天的早晨，这面旗就在农场主院内花园的旗杆上升起。雪球解释说，绿色的旗帜象征绿色的英格兰田野。而白色的蹄子和犄角代表未来的动物共和国，这个共和国将在人类最终被打倒后诞生。升旗仪式完成之后，所有动物列队进入大谷仓参加一个名为碰头会的全体大会。在这里将对下一周的工作做出安排，对各项决议进行提议和讨论。总是由猪来提出各项议案，虽然其他的动物懂得怎样表决，但从不能想起自己的任何议案。而雪球和拿破仑在讨论中则无疑是最为活跃的分子。但非常明显的是，他们两个一直不合：无论其中一个提出什么建议，另一个就一定会加以反对。就连那些已经通过的议案也不例外，比如，把果园后面的一小片牧场留给过了劳动年龄的动物作为他们的养老场所，这个议题本身谁也不会反对，他们还是在为如何确定各类动物退休年龄的问题上，发生了一场暴风雨般的激烈争论。碰头会照例伴随着《英格兰的牲畜》的歌声结束，下午是娱乐时间。



猪们已经把马具室空出来作为他们自己的指挥部了。每天晚上，他们就在这里，从那些在农场主院子拿来的书本上学习打铁、木工以及其他各种必不可少的技艺。雪球自己还忙于组织其他动物参加他称之为“动物委员会”的机构。他干这些事情真正是不屈不挠，乐此不疲。他为母鸡设立了“产蛋委员会”，为牛设立了“清洁尾巴社”，还设立了“野生同志再教育委员会”（这个委员会的宗旨是驯化老鼠和野兔），还为羊发起了“羊毛增白运动”，林林总总，不计其数。此外，还组建了读写班。不过总体而言，这些活动全都以失败告终。例如，驯化野生动物的尝试，几乎立刻流产。这些野生动物的行为依然和以前一模一样，要是宽宏大量对待他们，他们就公然乘机钻空子。猫参加了“再教育委员会”，几天内表现得非常活跃。有一天，有动物看见她正在窝棚顶上和一些麻雀交谈（麻雀所处的位置刚好在猫够不到的地方）。她告诉麻雀说，现在所有的动物都是同志了，任何麻雀只要愿意，都可以到她的爪子上来栖息，但麻雀们还是对她敬而远之。

然而，读写班却获得了巨大的成功。到了秋季，庄园里差不多所有的动物都程度不等地扫了盲。

对猪来说，他们已经能够非常熟练地阅读和书写。狗的阅读技能也掌握得相当不错，只是除了“七诫”之外，他们对读其他的东西一点也不感兴趣。山羊穆丽尔在某种程度上比狗读得还要好，她还经常在傍晚时分把从垃圾堆里找来的报纸残片念给别的动物听。本杰明的阅读本领与任何一头猪相比都毫不逊色，但他从来不运用他的本领。他说，据他所知，还没有什么值得阅读的东西。苜蓿把所有的字母都学会了，可就是不会把字母拼成单词。拳师学到的字母不能超过D，他会用他硕大的蹄子在尘土地上描绘出A、B、C、D，然后，抿着耳朵站在那里，死死地盯着那些字母，不时抖动一下额毛，绞尽脑汁地想下一个字母，可怎么也想不起来。当然，有那么几回，他确实学到了E、F、G、H，但等他把这几个字母学会了，又总是发现他已经把A、B、C、D给忘得干干净净了。最后，他决定暂且先牢牢记住头四个字母，并且每天总是写上一两遍，以便记得更牢。莫丽除了那六个拼出她自己名字的字母外，拒绝再学习任何其他的东西。她会用几根细嫩的树枝把她的名字非常灵巧地摆出来，然后用一两朵鲜花稍稍装饰，再绕着它们走几圈，夸赞一番。



庄园里的其他动物没有一个学得超过字母A的。另外还发现，像羊、鸡、鸭子等那些比较迟钝的动物，还不能熟记“七诫”。经过反复琢磨，雪球宣布“七诫”其实可以提炼为一条准则，那就是“四条腿好，两条腿坏”。他说，这条准则包含了动物主义的精髓，无论是谁彻底掌握了它，便免除了受到人类影响的威胁。禽鸟们首先提出异议，因为他们好像也只有两条腿，但雪球向他们证明其实不是这样的。

“同志们，”他说道，“禽鸟的翅膀，是一种用来推进的器官，而不是用来操控的，因此，它应该被看做是腿。而人的区别性标志是手，那正是致使他们恶贯满盈的器官。”

禽鸟们并没有弄懂雪球的喋喋不休的言论，但他们接受了他的解释。同时，所有那些比较迟钝的动物，都开始尽心尽力地在心里熟记这个新座右铭。“四条腿好，两条腿坏”还被题写在大谷仓一端的墙上，处于“七诫”的上方，而且字体更大一些。绵羊们一把这个新座右铭背下来，就愈发兴致勃勃。每当他们躺在地里时，便全都咩咩地叫着：“四条腿好，两条腿坏！四条腿好，两条腿坏！”持续叫上几个小时，从来不会感到厌烦。

拿破仑对雪球的各种委员会丝毫不感兴趣。他说，为那些已经长大的动物做任何工作都没有抓年轻一代的教育来得更为重要。碰巧杰西和蓝铃铛在收割完牧草后不久便都下了崽，她俩共产下九只强壮的幼崽。等这些小狗刚一断奶，拿破仑就把他们从母亲身边带走了，说是要为他们的教育负责。他把他们带到一间阁楼上，那间阁楼只能通过马具室里的一架梯子才能爬上去。他们处于与外界完全隔离的状态中，庄园里的其他动物很快就把小狗的存在给忘了。





牛奶去向之谜很快就弄清了。原来，它每天都给掺进了猪饲料里。早茬的苹果这会儿正在成熟，果园的草坪上到处都是被风吹落的果子。动物们原本认为由大家均分这些果子乃是情理之中的事情。然而，有一天，有一个指令传下来，说是被风吹落下来的苹果必须收集起来，送到马具室供猪们享用。对此，有些别的动物私下咕哝着抱怨，但是，这也于事无补。在这一点上，所有的猪出奇的一致，甚至雪球和拿破仑也不例外。声响器奉命向其他动物做些必要的澄清。

“同志们！”声响器大声喊道。“你们不会把我们猪这样做看成自私自利和享受特权的一种表现吧？我希望你们没有这样想。事实上，我们猪中有许多同志非常讨厌牛奶和苹果。我自己就很不喜欢。我们食用这些东西仅仅是为了要保持我们的身体健康。牛奶和苹果——这一点是经科学证明了的，同志们——含有的物质对猪的健康来说是必不可少的。我们猪是脑力劳动者。本庄园的整个管理和组织工作全都要依靠我们。我们为了大家的幸福日夜操劳。因此，正是为了你们，我们才喝那些牛奶，吃那些苹果的。如果我们这些猪不能恪尽职守，你们可知道会发生什么事情呢？琼斯将会死灰复燃！是的，琼斯将会死灰复燃！千真万确，同志们！”声响器一边跳来蹦去，一边摇摆着尾巴，几乎恳求地高声呼吁：“想必你们中间没有谁愿意看到琼斯回来吧？”

如果说现在在某件事情上动物们的态度能完全一致的话，那就是他们都不愿意琼斯回来。当声响器从这个角度澄清了问题以后，动物们也就没什么好说的了。让猪们保持良好的健康状态的重要性再明显不过了。因此，没有再继续争论下去，大家便一致同意：牛奶和被风吹落的苹果（并且还有苹果成熟后的收成中的大部分）应当由猪们单独享用。





第四章


到了那年夏天快结束时，有关动物庄园里所发生的事情的消息，已经在国家的一半地区传开。每一天，雪球和拿破仑都要放飞好几群鸽子。鸽子的任务是混入附近农场的动物中，向他们讲述造反的史实，并且教他们唱《英格兰的牲畜》。

这个时期，琼斯先生大部分时间都泡在威灵顿的红狮子酒吧里。他向每一个愿意听他诉说的人抱怨自己所遭受的难以置信的冤屈——竟然被一群无用的畜生赶出了自己的庄园。别的庄园主都对他表示原则上的同情，但最开始时并没有给他太多帮助。他们中的每一个人都在心里盘算着，自己是否能从琼斯的不幸中多少捞到些好处。幸运的是，与动物庄园相毗邻的两个庄园主相互间一直不合。一个名叫福克斯伍德庄园，面积很大，是一个老式庄园，由于疏于管理，牧场一片荒芜，树篱也无人整修。庄园主皮尔金顿先生是一位逍遥自在的乡绅，根据季节的变化，他不是钓鱼消磨时间，就是去打猎度日。另一个名叫平彻菲尔德庄园，面积小一些，但打理得相当不错。它的主人是弗雷德里克先生，一个蛮横而奸诈的人，接连不断地牵扯到官司中，以锱铢必较而出名。这两个人彼此憎恶至极，以致双方想要达成任何协议对他们来说都是非常艰难的，即使事关他们的共同利益，也是如此。



不过，动物庄园的造反行动还是把他们都吓得魂飞魄散，迫不及待地要阻止他们自己庄园里的动物获悉这方面的消息。刚开始，他们还假装轻松，对动物们自己管理庄园的想法充满了嘲弄和蔑视。他们说，这场风波至多两个星期就会结束。他们到处散布谣言，说曼纳庄园——他们坚持称之为曼纳庄园，而无法容忍动物庄园这个名称——的牲畜在不停地打斗互殴，而且很快都要饿死了。一段时间过去了，那里的动物显然并没有饿死，弗雷德里克和皮尔金顿就话锋陡转，开始说可怕的邪气目前在动物庄园中盛行。他们说，据说那里的动物已经在吃同类的肉，用烧得通红的马蹄铁互相拷打折磨，还共同占有他们的雌性配偶。弗雷德里克和皮尔金顿说，这正是悖于天理的造反带来的必然结果。

然而，没有任何人对于这些说法信以为真。关于一座不同寻常的庄园的传言一直不绝于耳：那里的人全部被赶走了，动物们自行管理自己的事务。这个小道消息语焉不详，而且以各种版本继续流传。整整一年，一股造反的浪潮在乡村间此起彼伏：一向很容易驾驭的公牛一下子变野了；羊撞坏了树篱，把苜蓿糟踏得一片狼藉；母牛踢翻了奶桶；猎马拒绝越过栅栏而把背上的骑手甩了过去。最令人费解的是，《英格兰的牲畜》的调子甚至还有歌词已经在到处传唱，其传播速度快得让人惊叹。当人们听到这首歌时，尽管故意装作不屑一顾，事实上心里怒气冲天。他们说，他们简直不能理解，怎么连动物们竟也堕落到去唱如此可耻的拙劣曲调。所以，凡是唱这支歌而被逮住的动物，当场就是一顿鞭抽。可这支歌仍然压制不下去，乌鸫在树篱上啼啭着的是它，鸽子在榆树上咕咕地叫着的也是它。歌声渗入铁匠铺的嘈杂声中，渗进教堂钟鸣的音调中。人们听到这歌声，禁不住暗暗颤抖，仿佛从中听到了他们自己所面临的厄运的预言。



十月初，谷物已经收割完毕，并且堆放好了，其中一部分已经脱了粒。有一天，一群鸽子从空中急速飞回，神色万分紧张地飞落在动物庄园的院子里。原来琼斯带领他的所有伙计们，再加上另外六个来自福克斯伍德庄园和平彻菲尔德庄园的人，已经进了五闩大门，正沿着通向庄园的车道向这儿走来。除了领队的琼斯先生手里拿着一支猎枪外，他们全都手执棍棒。显而易见，他们是为夺回这座庄园而来的。

他们的行动早已在预料之中，并且一切准备工作也都已就绪。雪球来指挥这次防御战。他曾钻研过从庄主院的屋子里找到的一本旧书，该书是分析恺撒大帝历次重大战役的。他迅速发出一道道命令，不到两分钟的时间，动物们已经全都进入自己的战斗岗位。

当这伙人接近庄园的窝棚时，雪球发动了他的第一轮攻击，所有的鸽子，足足有三十五只之多，在这伙人头上飞来飞去，从半空中冲他们一齐拉屎。正当人们躲闪鸽子的“空袭”时，一直藏在树篱后的一大群鹅冲了出来，狠狠地啄他们的腿肚子。不过，这仅仅是一场小规模的战斗前奏，目的在于制造点小混乱。这帮人用棍棒轻而易举地就把鹅赶跑了。接着雪球发动了他的第二轮攻击，穆丽尔、本杰明以及所有的羊，在雪球的率领下向前冲去，从四面八方对这伙人又戳又顶，而本杰明则转过身去用他的小蹄子对他们尥起蹶子来。可是，这帮拎着棍棒、靴子上又带着钉子的人还是太厉害了，动物们又一次被击退了。突然，一声尖叫从雪球那里发出，动物们听到这退兵的信号，全部掉头从门口退回院子内。

那些人发出一阵得胜的欢叫，正和他们所想象的一样，他们看到敌人们四处逃窜，于是没有经过部署就开始追击。这正好中了雪球的计谋。那些人刚完全进入院子，一直埋伏在牛棚里的三匹马、三头牛以及所有的猪，突然出现在他们身后，正好切断了仇敌的退路。雪球这才发出了进攻的信号。他自己径直向琼斯扑去，琼斯看见他扑上来，举起枪就射，弹粒紧挨着雪球的背部划出了几道血痕，一只羊却被击中而死。没有片刻的犹豫，雪球把那两百多磅的身体向琼斯的腿猛地撞去。琼斯被撞到一个粪堆上，猎枪也从他手中飞了出去。但是最令人惊恐万状的场景还是在拳师那儿，他就像一匹没有阉割的成年雄马，竟靠后腿着地把身子直立起来，挥舞着他那钉着铁掌的两只大蹄子。他挥出的第一拳就击中了来自福克斯伍德庄园的一个马夫的脑袋，打得他直挺挺地倒在泥坑里不能动弹。看到情势不妙，其中的几个人扔掉棍子，企图拔腿就跑。他们被吓得魂飞魄散。紧接着，就在所有动物的追逐下，他们在院子中绕着圈子到处乱跑。他们饱受顶撞、踢踹、撕咬和践踏之苦。庄园里的每一只动物无不各尽所能向人们复仇。就连那只猫也一下子从房顶上跳到一个牛倌的肩膀上，把爪子刺进他的脖子里，疼得那牛倌大声惨叫。有一瞬间，门口并无动物看守，这伙人万分惊喜，瞅准机会冲出院子，迅即朝着大路的方向逃去。一路上又有鹅穷追不舍地跟在他们后面啄着他们的腿肚子，嘘嘘地轰赶他们。就这样，他们这次侵袭还没有超过五分钟，就又从来时的那条路仓皇败逃了。



除了一个人之外，所有的人全都跑了。回到院子里，拳师用蹄子扒拉一下那个脸朝下趴在泥坑里的马夫，尝试着把他翻过身来。这家伙纹丝不动。

“他死了，”拳师悔恨地说。“我原本不打算这样做的。我忘了我还穿着铁靴子呢。有谁相信我这不是故意的呢？”

“不必感伤，同志！”伤口还在流血的雪球大声说道。“战争就是战争。唯一的好人就是死人。”

“我并没有夺取性命的想法，甚至对人同样如此，”拳师反复重申，两眼还饱含着泪水。

“莫丽哪儿去了？”有动物惊叫道。

莫丽的确不见了。一时间，阵阵恐慌漫上了动物们的心头；大家担心那些人设了什么计谋伤害了她，甚至担心她被人给抢走了。最终才发现她正躲在自己的厩棚内，头还埋在马槽的草料之中。刚才枪声一响，她就逃跑了。等到大家找到莫丽以后动身返回院子的时候，发现那个马夫已经苏醒并乘机溜掉了，原来此前他只是被打昏了。

动物们现在又重新集合到一起，他们沉浸在无可比拟的兴奋之中，每一位都敞开嗓门大声列举自己在刚才那场战斗中的显赫功绩。当下，他们立即举办了一场即兴的祝捷庆功会。庄园的旗帜升起来了，《英格兰的牲畜》被反复唱颂。接着又给那只被枪打死的羊举行了肃穆的葬礼，并在她墓前种植了一棵山楂树。雪球在墓前发表了一番简短的讲话，他强调说，要是需要的话，每个动物都应当做好为动物庄园牺牲的准备。

动物们一致决定设立一个军功勋章，“一级动物英雄”勋章就地颁发给了雪球和拳师。那是一枚铜质奖章（实际上是在马具室里找到的一些旧的铜质马饰），可在星期天和节假日里佩戴。另外一枚“二级动物英雄”勋章被追授给那只死去的羊。

关于如何称谓这次战斗的事，大家议论纷纷，最后决定命名为“牛棚战役”，因为埋伏就是在那儿发动的。他们找到了琼斯先生那支掉在泥坑里的猎枪，又在农场主住房内发现了备用的子弹。于是决定把猎枪架在旗杆脚下，把它作为一门礼炮，每年鸣放两次，一次在十月十二日的牛棚战役纪念日，一次在施洗约翰节的起义纪念日。





第五章


随着冬天的临近，莫丽变得越来越让大家厌烦。她每天早上干活老是晚点，而且为自己辩解的理由一直是她睡过头了；她还常常抱怨一些莫名其妙的病痛，不过，她的胃口却出奇的好。她会找出各种各样的借口逃避干活，跑到饮水池边，傻傻地立在那儿，凝视着她自己在水中的倒影。但还有一些谣言所涉及的问题比这还要严重一些。有一天，当莫丽摇摆着她的长尾巴，口中嚼着一根草根，愉快潇洒地闲逛到院子里时，苜蓿把她拉到一旁。

“莫丽，”她说，“我有件非常严肃的事要对你说。今天早晨，我看见你在检查把动物庄园和福克斯伍德庄园隔开的那段树篱时，皮尔金顿先生的一个伙计当时正站在树篱的另一边。尽管我离得比较远，但我敢肯定我看见他在跟你说话，你还让他抚摩你的鼻子。这究竟是怎么回事，莫丽？”

“他没有摸！我也没让他抚摩！这不是真的！”莫丽大声叫嚷，并开始蹦蹦跳跳，用蹄子扒地。

“莫丽！看着我，你是否敢以名誉做担保，证明那个人并没有抚摩过你的鼻子。”

“这不是真的！”莫丽一再重申这句话，但却不敢正眼看苜蓿。然后，她撒腿就跑，逃到田野里去了。

苜蓿心中念头一闪。她和其他的动物什么也没有说，径直跑到莫丽的厩棚里，用蹄子把干草翻了一遍。一小堆方糖和几束各种颜色的饰带竟然被藏在干草下面。

三天后，莫丽失踪了，好几个星期有关她的行踪都杳无音信。后来鸽子报告说，他们曾在威灵顿的另外一边见到过她。莫丽当时正套着一辆双轮马车，那辆车很漂亮，漆成红黑两色，停在一个酒吧外面。有个身穿格子马裤打着绑腿的红脸胖子，看起来像是酒吧老板，正抚摩着她的鼻子，给她喂糖块。她的毛发新近才修剪过，额头上还绑着一条鲜红的饰带。她看上去一副洋洋自得的样子——鸽子如是说。动物们从那以后再也不提莫丽了。



一月份的天气恶劣到了极点。泥土好像铁板一样，地里什么活也做不了。在大谷仓里已经召开了很多次会议，猪们忙于为下一季度的工作做规划。大家都已经接受，应该由明显比其他动物更聪明的猪们去解决事关庄园里大政方针的所有问题，虽然他们的决策只有通过大多数表决同意后才能生效。要不是雪球和拿破仑相互之间总是不停地争吵，所有的安排会进行得相当顺利。可是在每一个可能发生分歧的地方上，他们就没有不争论的：如果他们俩中的一个建议播种更大面积的大麦，另一个则肯定要求播种更大面积的燕麦；如果一个说某某地方种卷心菜再合适不过了，另一个就会断言那里要是不种根茎作物，就是毫无用处的一块废地。他们俩都有自己的拥护者，两派之间还有过一些颇为激烈的争辩。在碰头会上，雪球说得头头是道，令绝大多数动物心悦诚服。而拿破仑更长于在会议休息期间为自己游说拉票争取到支持。他在绵羊中间特别成功。后来，不管是否合乎时宜，绵羊们都喜欢叫“四条腿好，两条腿坏”，并常常借此来打断碰头会。而且，大家注意到了，每当雪球的讲话讲到某些关键处时，他们就极有可能猛然间放声大叫“四条腿好，两条腿坏”。雪球曾在农场主房里找到一些过期的《农场主与畜牧业者》的杂志，并对这几本杂志做过深入的钻研，脑子里装满了革新和改进的设计。他谈起农田排水、饲料保鲜和碱性炉渣来天花乱坠。他还设计出一套复杂的系统，可以把所有的动物每天在不同地方排出的粪便直接通到农田，以节省马车装运的劳力。拿破仑从来没有提出自己的设计方案，却绕来绕去地说雪球的这些方案最终将会是一场空。看起来拿破仑是在等待时机了。但是在他们所有的争吵中，最为激烈的莫过于围绕风车一事爆发的争辩。

在离庄园里窝棚不远的狭长的大牧场那儿，有一座成为庄园制高点的小山包。雪球在勘察过地形之后，宣布说那里是最适宜建造风车的地方。这风车可以让发电机组运转起来，从而为庄园供电。电能够为窝棚照明并在冬天取暖，还可以带动圆锯、铡草机、甜菜切片机以及电动挤奶机。动物们此前还从来没有听说过任何这类新鲜事（因为这是一家老式的庄园，只有一些最原始的机械）。当雪球有声有色地描述关于那些神奇的机器的未来美景时，他们都听得如痴如醉，好像看到了那些神奇的机器代替他们干活，而他们悠闲地在地里吃草，或为修养心性而阅读谈天。

短短的几个星期内，雪球的风车设计方案就全部制定出来了。机械方面的详细资料大多取自原先属于琼斯先生的三本书：《实用家居一千条》、《自己动手建房舍》和《电工入门》。雪球把曾经放孵卵器的一间棚屋作为他的工作室，里面铺着光滑的木制地板，对于画图来讲非常适宜。他把自己关在里面，往往一干就是几个小时。他用石块压着那些打开的书本，蹄子的两趾间夹着一支粉笔，来来回回麻利地走个不停，一边绘图，一边发出有些兴奋的哼唧声。设计图慢慢地深入到有大量曲柄和齿轮的错综复杂的部分，图面几乎覆盖了整个地板的大半部分，虽然这在其他动物看起来完全是云山雾罩，但却给他们留下了深刻的印象。动物们至少每天都要来一次，看看雪球绘的图。甚至鸡和鸭也每天都来，而且尽力不去踩踏那些粉笔线。只有拿破仑从不参观。他从一开始就声言自己反对风车。然而有一天，出乎大家意料的是，他竟然也来查看设计图了。他挪动着笨重的身子在棚子里绕来转去，仔细查看了设计图上的每一处细节，还冲着它们用鼻子使劲地嗅了几下，然后站了一会儿，乜斜着眼睛打量着设计图。突然，他抬起腿来，冲着那些设计图撒了一泡尿，便扬长而去，什么都没有说。



整个庄园在风车一事上陷入了严重的分裂状态。雪球毫不否认修造风车是一项困难重重的事业，需要开采石头并筑成墙，还得制造做风车用的翼板，另外还需要发电机和电缆（至于如何弄到这些东西，雪球当时没说）。但他坚持认为这项工程不要一年的时间就可以完成。而且还宣称，到那时大量的劳力将会因此而节省下来，动物们每周只需要工作三天就可以了。相反，拿破仑却争辩说，如今的当务之急是增加食料生产，而要是他们把时间浪费在建造风车上，他们将全部都要饿死。动物们在不同的口号下形成了两派，一派的口号是“拥护雪球和每周三天工作制”，另一派的口号是“拥护拿破仑和食料满槽制”。本杰明是唯一一个不属于任何一派的动物。他既不相信食料会更加丰足，也不相信风车能节省劳力。他说，有没有风车无所谓，日子会一如从前地继续过下去的，也就是说仍会过得并不如意。

除了围绕风车一事的争论之外，还存在着庄园的防御问题。尽管在牛棚战役中把那些人给击溃了，但是他们为了夺回庄园并让琼斯先生复辟，完全有可能发动一次更为凶残的拼死进攻。那帮人也比以前有更为充足的理由来这样做，因为他们打了败仗的消息已经传遍了整个国家，致使附近很多庄园的动物比以前更加难以驾驭了。可是雪球和拿破仑又一如既往地意见不一致。按照拿破仑的观点，动物们必须想方设法弄到武器，并自我训练学会使用。而按雪球的看法，他们应该放出越来越多的鸽子，煽动其他庄园的动物起来造反。前者认为假如不自卫，他们只有束手就擒的份儿；而后者则认为假如造反风起云涌，他们完全没有必要进行自卫。动物们先听了拿破仑的观点，又听了雪球的主张，竟然不能断定谁对谁错。事实上，他们发现，此刻哪一位正在讲话，他们必定就会同意这一位的意见。

那一天终于来到了，雪球的蓝图设计出来了。在接下来的星期天碰头会上，将对要不要开工建造风车的议题进行表决。动物们在大谷仓里集合完毕后，雪球站起来开始讲话，尽管时不时地被绵羊们的咩咩声打断，他还是摆出一条条他拥护建造风车的缘由。接着，拿破仑站起来予以回击，他转弯抹角地说风车纯属胡搞瞎闹，他奉劝大家不要支持它，随即又重重地坐了下去。他讲了几乎不到半分钟的时间，似乎对发言所产生的效果毫不在乎。雪球听他这么一说，立即跳了起来，他先喝令又要咩咩乱叫的绵羊们闭嘴，继而情绪激昂地陈述自己的意见，呼吁动物们支持建造风车。在这之前，动物们各支持一方，基本上是平均地分成两派，然而转眼之间，雪球出众的辩才就把他们说得服服帖帖。他用激情四射的语言，描述着一副当动物们摆脱了又脏又累的劳动时动物庄园所呈现的景象。他的想象力此时此刻早已远远超出了铡草机和甜菜切片机。他说，电能不但能使脱粒机、犁、耙、碾子、收割机和捆扎机一一运转起来，而且还能给每一个厩棚提供电力照明、冷热水以及电暖气等等。等他结束自己演讲的时候，表决的态势已经毫无悬念了。就在这个关键时刻，拿破仑抽身站起，向雪球投去了奇怪的一瞥，发出了一声尖细的号叫，这样的号叫声以前没有任何一个动物听到过。



这时，会场外顿时传来一阵令人毛骨悚然的狂叫声。紧接着，九条戴着铜饰项圈的强壮的狗朝大谷仓冲了进来，径直向雪球身上扑了过去。雪球及时纵身一跃，跳离了自己所处的位置，才逃过了被那些钢颌利牙撕扯的一劫。雪球一溜烟跑到了门外，九条狗在后面穷追不舍。动物们惊愕得不知所措，全都瞠目结舌。他们纷纷挤到门外注视着这场追逐。雪球飞奔着穿过通向大路的狭长的牧场。也只有猪才能这样没命地奔跑，但是那些狗近在咫尺。突然间，他滑倒了，眼看着就要被九条狗抓住了。然而他又重新爬起来，并且跑得比以前更快了。那些狗又一次逼了上来，其中一条狗差点咬住了雪球的尾巴，幸而雪球死命甩开了尾巴，才及时逃脱。接着，他又一个倾尽全力的冲刺，和狗就那么几英寸的距离，终于从树篱中的一个豁口逃窜了出去，转瞬间就消失得无影无踪。



动物们胆战心惊地爬回大谷仓，一个个都沉默不语。没过多久，那些狗又蹦跳着跑了回来。一开始，谁都猜想不出这些家伙是从哪儿来的，但这一问题很快就真相大白了：那正是拿破仑早先从他们的母亲身边带走并偷偷豢养的狗崽子。他们尽管还没有完全长大，但已俨然是九条成年大狗，一个个看上去凶神恶煞，仿佛一群恶狼一般。他们始终紧紧簇拥在拿破仑身边。大家都注意到，他们对着拿破仑摆尾巴的姿态，竟然跟别的狗从前向琼斯先生所表现的姿态一模一样。

这时，拿破仑在狗的簇拥下，登上往日里少校发表演讲的那个隆起的台子。他宣布，从今往后，星期天早晨的碰头会就此结束。他说，那些会议毫无必要，完全在浪费时间。今后有关庄园工作的所有议题，将有一个由猪组成的专门委员会做出决定，这个委员会由他亲自掌管。猪委员们将在私下碰头，然后再向其他动物传达他们做出的决策。动物们在星期天早晨仍要聚集在一起，向庄园的旗帜致敬，唱颂《英格兰的牲畜》，并接受他们的下一周的工作任务。但从此以后再没有什么辩论了。

尽管雪球遭到驱逐已经给他们带来了不小的震撼，但他们为刚才宣布的那些决定更是感到惊愕不已。有一些动物本想提出抗议，偏偏又找不到合适的辩词。就连拳师也感到迷惑不解。他支起两只耳朵，晃动了几下前额，费力地想把自己的种种想法理出个头绪，但是最后还是没想出任何可说的话。不过，有几头猪倒是能清楚地表达自己的观点。坐在前排的四只小肉猪尖叫着表示了自己的不满，他们当即全都跳起来准备发言。但围坐在拿破仑身旁的那群狗猛地发出一阵低沉而又恐怖的咆哮，四只小肉猪顿时默不作声，重新坐了下去。接着，绵羊们又以可怕的咩咩声大声叫起“四条腿好，两条腿坏”，一直持续了一刻钟，结果，所有讨论一下的机会也统统消失殆尽了。

后来，声响器奉命在庄园各处转了一圈，就新的安排向其他动物做出解释。

“同志们，”他说，“拿破仑同志承担了这些额外的劳动，我相信在这儿每一位的动物都会对他所做的牺牲做出高度评价的。同志们，不要想当然地认为当领导是一种享受！恰恰相反，这是一份深远的、沉甸甸的责任。没有谁能比拿破仑同志更坚定地相信所有动物一律平等。他也非常希望让你们自己做主。可是，万一你们做出了错误的决策，同志们，我们的境况将会怎样呢？假设你们决定跟从雪球的风车白日梦走，会怎样呢？雪球这家伙，就我们现在所知，比一个罪犯好不到哪里去。”

“他在牛棚战役中作战很英勇，”有个动物说。

“只有英勇是不够的，”声响器说。“忠诚和服从更为重要。就牛棚战役来说，我相信我们总会有一天发现雪球在其中所起的作用被过多地吹捧了。纪律，同志们，铁的纪律！那才是我们当今的口号。只要一步走错，我们的仇敌便又会在我们头上作威作福。同志们，你们一定不愿意让琼斯回来吧？”

这番论证再一次成为无可辩驳的真理。毋庸置疑，动物们不愿意琼斯回来；如果星期天早晨召集的辩论有导致他卷土重来的可能，那么辩论就必须停止。拳师细细琢磨了很长时间，说了句代表大家普遍感受的话：“要是拿破仑同志这样说，那就一定错不了。”并且从此以后，他又吸收了“拿破仑同志永远正确”这句格言，作为对他那句“我要更加努力工作”的个人座右铭的补充。

那时天气已经转暖，春耕开始了。那间雪球用来绘制风车蓝图的棚屋还仍然被封着，大家都认为那些画在地板上的设计图也已被擦掉了。每个星期天上午十点钟，动物们在大谷仓里集合，接受他们本周的工作任务。如今，老少校的那个已没了肉的脑壳，也已经从果园里挖了出来，置放在旗杆下的一个树桩上，位于猎枪的旁边。升旗仪式结束后，动物们要按照要求恭恭敬敬地列队从那个脑壳前面走过去，然后才进入大谷仓。如今，他们已经不再像以前那样大家全都坐在一起。拿破仑跟声响器以及另外一个叫小不点的猪，共同坐在前台。这个小不点在谱曲作诗方面具有非凡的天赋。九条尚且年轻的狗围着他们呈半圆形坐着。其他的猪坐在后面。剩余的动物面朝他们坐在大谷仓中间。拿破仑用一种粗暴的军人作风把一周的工作安排宣读完毕，接着只唱了一遍《英格兰的牲畜》，所有的动物就全部散去。

雪球被驱赶出去后的第三个星期天，拿破仑宣布风车最终还是要建造，动物们听到这个消息都颇感意外。但是拿破仑并没有为改变主意做出任何解释，仅仅是告诫动物们，那项额外的任务是一项非常艰辛的工作，甚至有必须缩减他们食料的可能。然而，所有的筹备工作甚至连最后的细节部分都已经安排妥当。过去三周内，一个由猪组成的专门委员会在一直为这件事忙碌着。风车的建造，加上其他各种项目的改进，预计要花两年的时间。



当天晚上，声响器私下对其他动物透露，拿破仑从来没有真正反对过风车计划。相反，一开始正是他大力提倡建造风车。而雪球曾经画在孵卵棚地板上的设计图实际上是他从拿破仑的笔记中剽窃的。风车确实是拿破仑自己的创造。于是，有动物问道，为什么他原先如此强烈地反对建造风车？在这一点上，声响器显得十分狡猾。他说，这正是拿破仑同志的精明之处，他看起来好像反对建造风车，那纯粹只是一种战术，目的在于把雪球驱赶出去，因为雪球是个危险的家伙，并且造成了恶劣的影响。既然如今雪球已经逃走了，计划也就能顺利进行而不受他的干扰了。声响器强调，这就是所谓的策略，他一连重复了好几遍：“策略，同志们，策略！”同时绕着圈蹦蹦跳跳，尾巴随之灵巧地摆动着，并且伴随着欢快的笑声。动物们拿不准这些话的真正含意，但是声响器讲得却是那么富有说服力，加之碰巧有三条狗待在他的身边，又是那样令人惊恐地狂叫着，因此他们没有再进一步表示什么疑问，就认可了他的解释。





第六章


整整一年，动物们就像奴隶一样拼命干活。但他们乐此不疲，他们从不惜力，也不怕牺牲，因为他们清楚地认识到自己干的每件事无不是为了他们自己及其后代的利益，而不是为了那帮游手好闲、专事偷盗的人类。

整个春季和夏季，他们每周都要工作六十个小时。到了八月份，拿破仑又宣布，从今往后星期天下午也必须照常工作。这种劳动完全是自愿自发的，不过，凡是哪个动物缺勤，就要把他的口粮减去一半。即便如此，大家发现一些任务还是无法完成。收成比上一年要差一些，而且，由于两块田地没有及时翻耕，原本应该在初夏播种的根茎作物也没有种成。可以预见，即将到来的冬季将是一个艰难的时节。

风车工程遇到了意想不到的各种困难。庄园里本来就有一处质地相当不错的石灰石矿，又在一间棚屋里找到了大量的沙子和水泥，如此一来，按说风车所需的材料都已齐备。但问题是，动物们刚开始不知道怎样才能把石头砸成尺寸大小适用的碎块。似乎只有使用十字镐和撬棍，不然就没法干这活。可是这些工具动物们都不会使用，因为他们都不能用后腿站立。在白白耗费了几个星期的气力之后，才有动物想出了一个绝妙的主意，就是利用地心引力的作用。那些巨大的圆石由于体积太大都无法直接利用，整个采石场上闲置的到处都是。于是，动物们用绳子绑住石头，然后全体出动，由牛、马、羊和所有能抓住绳子的动物——有时甚至连猪也在关键时刻出把力——他们以超乎想象的慢速度一起把石头沿着斜坡拖到矿顶。到了那儿，把石头从崖边上推下去，到了地面就摔成了碎块。运送摔碎的石块就显得相对容易多了。马运送满载的货车，羊则拖那些单块的，就连母山羊穆丽尔和驴子本杰明也合拉一辆旧的两轮轻便车。这样到了夏末，就累积了足够多的石块。接着，建造工程在猪的指挥下就破土动工了。

但这是一个进程缓慢、艰辛费力的过程。通常要竭尽全力干一整天才仅仅能把一块圆石拖到矿顶，偏偏有时候把它从崖上推了下去却没有摔碎。如果没有拳师，没有他那差不多能匹敌于其他所有动物合在一起的力气，估计什么事也干不成。每逢圆石开始往下滑，动物们发现他们自己正被拖下山坡而绝望地喊叫的时候，总是拳师使劲拼命地拉紧绳索才使圆石停下来。看着他举步维艰地吃力爬坡，看着他呼吸不断加快，蹄子尖紧紧地扣住地面，硕大的身躯完全被汗水浸透，所有的动物对他都充满了钦佩之情。苜蓿有时提醒他注意自己的身体，不要太过劳累，但拳师从来不以为然。对他来说，“我要更加努力工作”和“拿破仑同志永远正确”这两句口头禅用来回答什么问题都非常合适。他已同那只小公鸡重新定了协议，以前每天清晨提前半小时叫醒他，现在改成每天提前三刻钟。虽然近来空闲时间已经不多，但他仍然会利用提前起床的这点时间，独自到采石场去，在没有任何帮手的情况下，捡起地上的碎石装上满满的一车，拉到建造风车的选定的地点去。



整个夏季，尽管动物们的工作非常辛苦，他们的生活过得还不算太坏，如果说他们得到的食料没有琼斯时期多，但至少也不比那时少。他们只需要养活自己，而不必去供养那五个穷奢极欲的人，这种优势太明显了，它完全可以使很多挫折忽略不计。此外，在很多方面，动物们干活的方式，不但效率较高，而且节省劳力。就拿锄草这类活来说，动物们可以干得尽善尽美，而人类永远无法做到这一点。再说，由于动物们现在都不偷不摸了，也就没有必要用篱笆把牧场和耕地隔开，从而也就省去了大量保养树篱和栅栏的劳力。然而，随着夏天逐渐逝去，各种各样没有料想到的短缺就暴露出来了。庄园里需要煤油、钉子、线绳、狗食饼干以及钉马掌的铁等等，但这些东西庄园里又不能生产。到了后来，种子和人造化肥的短缺也被提上了议程，还有各类工具以及建造风车所用的机械设备。可是，这些东西如何才能弄到，动物们就都茫然无措了。

一个星期天上午，动物们聚集起来接受任务。拿破仑宣布，他决定对一项新政策做出决议。从此以后，动物庄园将要同附近的其他庄园做些交易，这当然不是出于任何商业上的目的，而只是为了获取某些迫切需要的物资。他说，必须要不惜一切代价弄到建造风车所需要的东西。为此，他正打算卖掉一垛干草和当年小麦收成的一部分，而且，以后要是需要更多的钱，就只有靠卖鸡蛋来弥补缺口了，因为鸡蛋在威灵顿一直是有销路的。拿破仑还说，鸡对这一牺牲应当感到非常高兴，因为这就是她们自己对建造风车做出的特殊贡献。

动物们再一次感受到一种难以名状的别扭。永远不跟人类打交道，永远不从事交易，永远不使用钱币——在琼斯被驱逐后的第一次欢欣鼓舞的碰头会上，那些最早就通过的决议中，不是明明包含这几条吗？通过这些决议的情形至今都还记忆犹新，或者说，至少他们以为还没有忘记有这回事。曾在拿破仑宣布废除碰头会时表示反对的四只幼猪，此刻怯生生地讲话了，但是他们立即就被那些恶狗给大声喝住，很快又沉默不语了。接着，绵羊们又和往常一样咩咩地叫起“四条腿好，两条腿坏”，短暂的难堪局面也就顺利地掩盖过去了。最后，拿破仑抬起前蹄示意大家安静，并宣布说他已经做好了一切安排，往后无需任何一只动物去干这种显然大家最为厌恶的事——同人类打交道。而他意欲把全部重担都压在自己肩上。住在威灵顿的一个叫温普尔的律师，已经同意担任动物庄园和外部世界的中介，并且将在每个星期一上午前来拜访以接受任务。最后，拿破仑在他例行的“动物庄园万岁”的叫喊声中结束了整个讲话。接着，在唱完《英格兰的牲畜》之后，动物们纷纷散场离去。

事后，声响器在庄园里转了一圈才打消了动物们的疑虑。他向他们保证，不准从事交易和使用钱币的决议从来就没有通过过，甚至连这样的提案都不曾有过。这完全是一种臆想，若是追根溯源，很可能就是最初雪球散布的一个谣言。一些动物对此仍然是心存疑虑，奸诈狡猾的声响器就问他们：“你们敢确定这不是你们梦到的一些事情吗，同志们？你们有关于这样一个决议的任何记录吗？它写在什么地方了？”这样一类的东西当然从来没有做过记载。因此，动物们也就确信是他们自己搞错了。

根据事先的约定，温普尔每个星期一都要来庄园一趟。他是一个有着狡诈外表的身材矮小的人，蓄着络腮胡子。作为一名律师，他经办的业务规模很小，不过他足够精明，比其他任何人更早地认识到动物庄园会需要经纪人，并且佣金也会非常丰厚。动物们怀着一种畏惧的心态看着他来了又去，去了又来，并且尽可能地避开他。不过，在他们这些四条腿的动物看来，拿破仑竟然向用两条腿站立的温普尔发号施令，一种自豪感便在他们心中油然而生，这也在一定程度上缓解了他们对这个新决议的抵触情绪。现在，动物们同人类的关系跟过去相比确实有着巨大的变化。但是，人们对动物庄园的憎恶非但没有因为它的繁荣兴旺而有所削弱，相反，对它的仇视比以往任何一个时候都要更严重。而且每个人都抱定这样一种信念：动物庄园早晚要破产，而最没有悬念的一件事是风车的建造一定将以失败而收场。人们在小酒馆里聚会，常常相互用图表来论证风车的倒塌是早已注定了的；或者说，即使它能建成，那也永远无法运转。虽然如此，对于动物们卓有成效地管理自己的事务，人们也不由自主地另眼相看了。这方面的一个迹象就是，人们在提到动物庄园时，不再故意叫它曼纳庄园，而开始用动物庄园这个名副其实的名称。他们放弃了支持琼斯的立场，而琼斯自己也早已是心灰意懒，对于夺回他的庄园不再抱有任何希望，并且已经搬到国内的另外一个地方生活了。要不是这个温普尔，动物庄园至今仍然无法和外部世界接触，但是不断有小道消息提到，拿破仑正打算同福克斯伍德的皮尔金顿先生，或者是平彻菲尔德的弗雷德里克先生签订一项确定无疑的商业协议，不过消息还提到，绝对不会同时和两家签订这个协议的。

大概就是在这个时候，猪们突然搬进了庄园主的院子里，并且把那里作为他们的房舍。这一下，动物们再次想起似乎有一条早先就通过的决议是禁止这种行为的。可声响器再一次使他们认识到，事情并不是像他们认为的那样。他说，猪作为庄园的首脑，理应有一处安静的工作场所，这一点是绝对必需的。况且住在房屋里比住在纯粹的猪圈里也更符合领袖尊贵的身份（近来他在提到拿破仑时已经开始使用“领袖”这一头衔）。尽管这样，还是有一些动物大惑不解，因为他们听说猪不仅仅是在厨房里用餐，而且把客厅当做娱乐室，甚至还睡在床上。拳师对此倒毫不在意，照例说了一句“拿破仑同志永远正确”。但是苜蓿却认为她记得有一条反对睡床的明确的规定，她跑到大谷仓尽头的墙下苦苦思索，力图从题写在那里的“七诫”中找出答案。结果她发现自己连单个的字母都不认识。她便找来母山羊穆丽尔。



“穆丽尔，”她说道，“把第四条戒律念给我听一下，它是不是说永远不在床上睡觉什么的？”

穆丽尔费了很大的劲才把它拼读出来。

“上面说的是，‘凡动物都不准睡床铺被单’，”她终于念了出来。

苜蓿觉得太奇怪了，她居然不记得第四条戒律提过被单，可它既然都写在墙上，那它一定原本如此。这时，声响器在两三条狗的陪同下碰巧路过这儿，他完全能够从适当的视角来剖析整个问题。

“那么，同志们，看来你们已经听说我们猪现在睡到庄园主房子里的床上的事情了？为什么不呢？难道你们真的以为有过这么一条反对睡在床上的戒律吗？床仅仅是指睡觉的地方而已。如果正确看待的话，窝棚里的一堆干草同样是一张床。这条戒律针对的是被单，因为被单是人类的发明。我们已经把庄园主房子里床上的被单全撤掉了，而睡在毯子里。它们也是非常舒适的床啊！但是同志们，我跟你们讲，如今所有的脑力工作都得由我们去完成，而这还远远没有达到我们所需要的那种舒适程度。同志们，你们不至于打算剥夺我们的休息权吧？你们不会使我们过于劳累而不能履行我们的职责吧？你们中间肯定没有谁愿意看到琼斯回来吧？”

在这个问题上，动物们立即就消除了疑虑，此后，也不再有谁谈论有关猪睡在庄园主房子里的床上这件事了。并且过了几天之后，专门委员会宣布，从今往后猪每天早晨要比其他动物晚一个小时起床，同样没有谁对此抱怨。

到了秋天，动物们都已经很累了，但是还算愉快。算起来他们已经辛苦地干了整整一年了，在卖了部分干草和谷物之后，准备过冬的饲料就不是十分富足了，但是，风车完全可以补偿这一切。如今这项工程差不多已经完成一半了。秋收结束以后，晴朗无雨的天气持续了很长一段时间，动物们干起活来比以前更加卖力了。他们认为整天辛劳地拖着石块来回奔忙还是非常值得的。因为这样一来，墙便能在一天之内又增高一英尺。拳师甚至在夜间也经常出来，借着中秋的月光，独自干上一两个小时。动物们则利用工作之余的时间绕着建造了近半的风车转来转去，赞叹那一面面坚固、笔直的墙体，并为他们竟能修建规模如此宏大的工程而感到惊叹不已。唯独老本杰明没有被风车刺激得头脑发热，他依然像平常那样，除了说驴都能活很长的时间这句玄妙神秘的话之外，就再也闭口不语了。

十一月带着猛烈的西南风来临了。由于这时湿度太大而没法搅拌水泥，建造工程不得不停了下来。恶劣的天气发展到后来的一个夜晚，终于狂风大作，整个庄园里的窝棚从地基上都摇摇晃晃，大谷仓顶棚的一些瓦片也卷走了。鸡群在恐惧中惊醒过来，吓得咯咯乱叫，因为他们在睡梦中同时听见远处一阵枪声。第二天早晨，动物们从窝棚里出来，发现旗杆已被风吹倒在地，果园坡下的一棵榆树也如同萝卜一般被连根拔起。就在他们刚刚目睹了这些景况，突然，每一只动物喉咙里都爆发出一阵绝望的号叫。一幅可怕的景象映入了他们的眼帘：风车成了一堆废墟。

他们不约而同地冲向出事地点。几乎难得外出步行半步的拿破仑，率先跑在所有动物的前面。是的，所有动物的奋斗成果竟然倒在那儿了，全部夷为平地了，他们千辛万苦砸碎并拉来的石头散落得到处都是。动物们悲伤地凝视着坍塌下来的散乱的碎石块，刚开始谁都说不出话来。拿破仑一言不发地来回踱着步，偶尔闻一闻地面上的味道，他的尾巴变得僵硬，并且还剧烈地从一边抽动到另一边。对他来说，这是心理活动高度紧张的表现。他突然停止不动了，似乎已经想出了办法。

“同志们，”他平静地说，“你们知道这是谁搞的鬼吗？你们知道是谁半夜进来摧毁了我们的风车吗？是雪球！”他突然用雷鸣般的声音咆哮道。“是雪球干了这件事！这个叛徒用心何其险恶，他在夜幕的掩盖下偷偷地爬到这里，把我们近一年的劳动成果完全摧毁。他妄图借此阻挠我们的计划，并为他自己可耻的被驱逐进行报复。同志们，我现在在这里宣布，判处雪球死刑。任何能将他绳之以法的动物，将被授予‘二级动物英雄’勋章以及得到十八升苹果。任何能将他捉拿归案的动物，可以得到三十六升苹果！”



动物们得知雪球竟会犯下如此罪孽时，无不感到极度震撼。于是，他们在一阵愤怒的吼叫之后，就开始琢磨如何在雪球胆敢再来时将他抓住。几乎就在同一时间，在离小山包不远的草地上，动物们发现了一头猪的蹄印。那些蹄印只有几码远的距离就消失不见了，但它的去向似乎是树篱上的一个缺口。拿破仑对着蹄印仔细地闻了一阵，便断言那蹄印是雪球留下的。拿破仑认为，按照他的看法，雪球有可能是从福克斯伍德庄园方向来的。

“不要再耽搁了，同志们！”拿破仑在查看了蹄印后大声说道。“还有工作需要我们去干，就是要从今天早晨起，我们开始重新建造风车，而且整个冬天，不论晴雨，我们都要投入到重建工程中来。我们要教训教训这个卑鄙的叛徒，他不能就这样易如反掌地把我们的成果给摧毁了。记住，同志们，我们的计划非但不会有丝毫改变，反而一定要按期完成。前进，同志们！风车万岁！动物庄园万岁！”





第七章




那是一个极其寒冷的冬天。狂风暴雨的天气刚刚结束，随之而起的就是冻雨和大雪，再往后便是天寒地冻。这种鬼天气直到二月才开始有所好转。动物们都在竭尽全力地继续推进风车的重建工程，因为他们都非常清楚外界正关注着他们，倘若风车不能重新及时完工，那些充满嫉妒的人类一定会为此幸灾乐祸的。

那些深怀敌意的人们，佯称他们不相信风车毁于雪球的暗中破坏。他们宣称，风车之所以倒塌完全是因为墙壁太薄。而动物们认为问题的症结并不在于此。尽管如此，他们还是决定把墙由上一次的一英尺半厚增加到这一次的三英尺厚。这就意味着必须采集更多的石头。但很长时间以来，采石场上积满了被风吹在一起的雪堆，什么事也做不了。在随后的干燥严寒的日子里倒是干了一些活，但那却是一项残酷无情的工作，动物们对此已经不像以前那样感到前途无量。他们总是感到饥寒交迫。只有拳师和苜蓿从来没有丧失信心。声响器则多次发表有关劳动的乐趣以及劳工的神圣之类的精彩演讲，但使其他动物受到更大鼓舞的，却是拳师的无限精力和他一直挂在嘴边的那声“我要更加努力工作”的嘶鸣。

到了一月份，食物就开始短缺了。谷类饲料的分量急剧地下降，动物们被告知将要发给额外的土豆来弥补不足。可随后却发现由于地窖上面没有盖得足够厚，致使收获的绝大部分土豆都已受冻而发软变坏了。土豆都已经发黑了，只有很少的一小部分还可以食用。一连过了很多天，动物们在这段时间里除了吃谷糠和萝卜外，再也没有其他东西可以充饥了。饥荒似乎已经在不远处虎视眈眈了。

对外界掩盖这一真相成了关乎生死的必然事务。风车的坍塌已经使人们的胆子又大了起来，他们因此就捏造出种种新奇的谎言，全都与动物庄园有关。外界又在四处谣传，说动物庄园所有的动物都挣扎在饥荒和瘟疫的死亡边界上，而且说他们内部纷争不断，甚至发展到了依靠同类相食和杀掉幼崽度日的地步。拿破仑清醒地认识到，倘若粮食状况的真相让外界知道，将会产生多么严重的后果，因此他决意利用温普尔先生去树立一种相反的印象。迄今为止，对温普尔先生的每周一次的来访，动物们还绝少甚至没有与他发生过接触。但是现在，他们却挑选了一小部分动物，绝大部分都是绵羊，授意他们在温普尔先生能够听得到的地方，假装是在不经意的闲聊中谈及饲料已经增加的事。另外，拿破仑吩咐把饲料棚里那些差不多已经是空空如也的大箱子里装上满满的沙子，然后把仅存一点的饲料覆盖在上面。最后找了个合适的借口，把温普尔引领着穿过饲料棚，并且让他瞥见了那些大箱子。温普尔被蒙骗过去了，就不断向外界传言，说动物庄园根本不存在粮食短缺的现象。

尽管如此，接近一月底的时候，问题就日益突出了，必须要从什么地方再弄到一些粮食。而这些天来，拿破仑几乎从不公开露面，而是整天待在庄园主院子里，那里的每一道门都由凶神恶煞的狗把守着。每当他要出来时，也是一种非常正式的方式，由六条狗组成的护卫队簇拥着他，一旦谁走得太近，那些狗都会狂吠起来。就是在星期天的早晨，他也经常不露面，而是通过另外的一头猪，通常是声响器来传达他的命令。

一个星期天的早晨，声响器宣布，所有下蛋的母鸡，必须上缴她们产下的蛋。因为通过温普尔牵线，拿破仑已经签订了一份每周提供四百枚鸡蛋的合同。出售这些鸡蛋所得收益将用于买回足够多的谷物和粗粉，使庄园能够一直维持到夏季到来，那时，情况将会好转。

母鸡们一听到这些，顿时发出了一片强烈的抗议声。虽然在此之前她们就已经得到过通知，说这种牺牲可能是难以避免的，但她们并不相信这种局面真会出现。此时，她们刚刚把自己开春孵育小鸡用的一窝蛋准备好，因此她们就纷纷抗议说，现在把鸡蛋拿走简直就等于谋财害命。于是，为了不让拿破仑的计划得逞，她们在三只年轻的米诺卡小黑鸡的带领下，做最后的拼死一搏。她们采取的方法是飞到椽子上去产蛋，结果鸡蛋落到地上都碎了。这是自琼斯遭到驱逐以来头一回发生的带有造反意味的行为。拿破仑迅速地做出了无情的决定。他命令停止供应母鸡们的饲料，同时命令道，任何动物胆敢救济母鸡一粒玉米，都将受到死刑的惩罚，并且由狗来负责执行上述命令。母鸡们坚持了五天，最终还是屈服了，又回到了她们的窝里。这期间一共死去了九只母鸡，她们的遗体全都掩埋在了果园中，对外的说法是她们死于球虫病。温普尔对于这件事毫不知情，鸡蛋按时交付，一辆食品专用篷车每周来一次庄园把鸡蛋拉走。

这段时间里，从来没有一个动物再见过雪球的踪影。有传言说他躲在附近的两家庄园之一，不是在福克斯伍德庄园就是在平彻菲尔德庄园。拿破仑这个时期同其他庄园的关系也比以前略有改善。碰巧在庄园的院子里有一堆木材，还是十年前清理一片榉树林时堆在那儿的，到现在已经风干，非常适用了。温普尔就建议拿破仑把它卖了。皮尔金顿先生和弗雷德里克先生都非常希望能买下它。可拿破仑还犹豫不定，不知道卖给哪一家好。有迹象证实，每当他好像将要和弗雷德里克先生达成协议时，就有传言说雪球正躲在福克斯伍德庄园；而当他倾向于和皮尔金顿先生签订协约时，就又有消息说雪球在平彻菲尔德庄园。

初春时节，突然出现了一个让大家惊恐不安的情况。雪球经常在夜间悄悄溜回庄园！动物们惊吓得躲在窝棚里不敢睡觉。据说，他每天晚上都在夜幕的掩护下潜入庄园搞各种各样的破坏。他偷走谷子，打翻牛奶桶，打破鸡蛋，践踏苗圃，噬咬果树皮。不论什么时候哪种事情出了乱子，通常都要归罪于雪球。倘若有一扇窗户玻璃打破了或者一个排水沟堵塞了，肯定会有某个动物认定这是雪球夜里溜进来干的。当饲料棚的钥匙找不到的时候，整个庄园的动物都坚信是雪球把它扔到井里去了。奇怪的是，甚至在发现那把钥匙原来是放错了地方，被压在了一袋面粉底下之后，大家依然深信是雪球所为。母牛们不约而同地声称，雪球溜进牛棚，趁她们熟睡时吸了她们的奶。那个冬天，老鼠们非常猖獗，他们也被指认为雪球的同伙。

拿破仑下令要对雪球的活动进行一次彻底的调查。他在几条狗的护卫下，开始对庄园的窝棚进行一次仔细的巡查，其他动物则毕恭毕敬地尾随在几步之外的地方。每走几步，拿破仑就停下来，嗅一嗅地面上有没有雪球脚步留下的气味。他说自己凭气味就能辨别出雪球的蹄印。他把每一个角落都嗅了个遍，从大谷仓、牛棚到鸡舍乃至菜园，几乎到处都能发现雪球的踪迹。他把嘴伸到地上，深深地吸上几口气，立即以一种骇人的声音惊呼道：“雪球！他来过这里！我能准确无误地嗅出来！”一听到“雪球”，所有的狗都张开了血盆大口，发出一阵令动物们毛骨悚然的狂吠。



动物们吓得失魂落魄。在他们看来，雪球就仿佛某种看不见的势力，弥漫在他们周围的空气中，使他们受到各种各样危险的威胁。到了晚上，声响器把他们召集在一起，带着一脸惶恐不安的神情告诉他们，他有一些重大事项要向大家通报。

“同志们！”声响器大声叫道，同时神经质地蹦来跳去。“一件最为恐怖的事情已经被发觉，雪球已经叛变到平彻菲尔德庄园的弗雷德里克那里去了。而那家伙正在阴谋策划着向我们发起攻击，妄图霸占我们的庄园！一旦发动袭击，将由雪球给他带路。但还有比这更为糟糕的，我们原本以为，雪球造反的原因仅仅是由于他的妄自尊大和野心勃勃。但是我们弄错了，同志们。你们可知道他造反的真正原因是什么吗？雪球从一开始就和琼斯是一丘之貉！他一直都是琼斯暗藏的间谍。我们刚刚发现了一些他没能带走的文件，这一点在那些文件中得到了充分的验证。同志们，在我看来，这就能说明很多的问题了。在牛棚战役中，他是如何企图使我们战败和毁灭的，难道不是我们亲眼所见的吗？万幸的是，他的阴谋并未得逞。”

大家全都惊呆了。与雪球毁坏风车的事相比，这一恶劣的行径简直是罪恶滔天。但是，他们在完全认可这一点之前，却迟疑了好大一会儿。他们都还记得，或者自以为还记得，在牛棚战役中，他们曾亲眼看见雪球在冲锋陷阵时一马当先，并在每一个紧要关头鼓舞大家的士气，而且，甚至在琼斯的子弹已伤到他的脊背时也丝毫没有停止进攻。他们首先就对这一点感到难以理解，这怎么能说明他是支持琼斯的呢？就连几乎从来不问任何问题的拳师也感到困惑不解。他躺了下来，把两个前腿压在身子底下，紧紧地闭着眼睛，费了很大的劲想理顺他的思路。

“我不信有这样的事，”他说。“雪球在牛棚战役中英勇善战，这是我亲眼所见的。战斗刚一结束，我们不是立刻授予了他‘一级动物英雄’勋章吗？”

“那是我们的过失，同志们，直到现在我们才弄清楚，他实际上是企图诱使我们走向毁灭。所有这些都明明白白地记载在我们已经发现的秘密文件中。”

“但是他受伤了啊，”拳师说。“我们都看到他流着血还在冲锋陷阵。”

“那也是早就安排好的一部分！”声响器叫道。“琼斯的子弹仅仅是擦破了他的一点皮罢了。倘若你能识字的话，我可以给你看他亲自记录的文件。他们的预谋，就是在关键时刻让雪球发出一个撤退的信号，从而把庄园奉送给敌人。他差一点就要成功了，我甚至可以说，同志们，假设没有我们英勇的领袖拿破仑同志，估计他早就得逞了。难道你们忘记了，就在琼斯和他的伙计们冲进院子的那一瞬间，雪球突然转身就逃，于是好多动物也都跟着他跑了？还有，就在那一会儿，恐慌情绪正在蔓延，眼看着就要完了，拿破仑同志大喊一声‘消灭人类！’，同时冲上前去死死咬住了琼斯的一条腿，那一情景难道你们也不记得了吗？同志们，想必你们一定记得这些吧？”声响器一边左蹦右跳，一边大喊大叫着。

既然声响器把那一情景描述得如此生动细腻，动物们好像就觉得确实记得有那么回事。不管怎么说，他们记得在那一仗的紧要关头，雪球确实曾经掉头逃跑。但是拳师还是感到有一些心神不安。

“我不相信雪球一开始就是个叛徒，”他终于开口了。“他后来的所作所为另当别论。不过我认为在牛棚战役中他还是一个好同志。”

“我们的领袖，拿破仑同志，”声响器以非常缓慢而又极其坚定的语气宣布，“已经明确地——明确地，同志们——认定，雪球从一开始便是琼斯的奸细。是的，远在还没有谁想到造反之前就是的。”

“噢，那就是另外一回事了！”拳师说。“倘若这是拿破仑同志说的，那一定是错不了的。”

“这才是正确的态度，同志们！”声响器喊叫道。但是有动物注意到他那闪闪发光的小眼睛向拳师投去了恶狠狠的一瞥。在他转身离去时，又停了一下，加重语气补充了一句：“我提醒庄园的每个动物都要瞪大你们的双眼。因为我们有理由相信，雪球暗藏的间谍正潜伏在我们中间！”

过了四天以后的那个下午，拿破仑命令所有的动物都聚集到院子中。等他们全部到齐了，拿破仑从屋里走了出来，佩戴着他的两枚勋章（因为他最近刚授予自己一枚“一级动物英雄”勋章和一枚“二级动物英雄”勋章），他那九条高大的狗围着他蹦来蹦去，他们发出的阵阵狂吠让所有的动物都不寒而栗。动物们蜷缩在各自的位子上默不作声，似乎已经预感到有什么可怕的事情将要发生。



拿破仑站在那儿，表情严厉地扫视了一遍他的听众，接着便发出一声尖叫。那些狗就立刻蹿上前去，咬住了四头猪的耳朵把他们往外拖。那四头猪在疼痛和惊恐中拼命号叫着，被拖到了拿破仑脚下。猪的耳朵鲜血直流。狗尝到了血腥味，好一会儿竟然像完全发疯了一样。令每一只动物都大吃一惊的是，有三条狗竟一齐扑向了拳师。拳师看到他们扑了过来，当即伸出一只巨掌，在半空中抓住其中的一条狗，把他踩在地上。那条狗哀叫着求饶，另外两条狗赶紧夹着尾巴逃了回去。拳师看着拿破仑，想知道是该把那狗踩死呢还是该把他放掉。拿破仑似乎脸色陡变，他厉声喝令拳师把狗放掉。拳师抬起蹄子，狗带着伤哀号着溜走了。

喧嚣马上平息下来了。那四头猪浑身战栗着等待处置，面孔上的每一道纹理之中仿佛都刻写着他们的罪状。拿破仑喝令他们坦白自己的罪行。他们正是曾经抗议拿破仑废除星期天碰头会的那四头猪。还没等进一步逼供，他们便交代说，自从雪球遭到驱逐以后，他们和他一直有着秘密的往来，在摧毁风车一事上，他们曾经配合过他，并和他达成一项协议，准备把动物庄园奉送给弗雷德里克先生。他们还补充说，雪球曾在私下里向他们透露，他多年以来一直是琼斯的特务。他们刚一披露完毕，狗就马上撕裂了他们的喉咙。这时，拿破仑以一种令在场的动物无比胆战心惊的声音质问其他的动物，还有什么要坦白的。



曾经在鸡蛋事件试图领头造反的那三只母鸡走上前去，供称雪球曾出现在她们的睡梦中，并煽动她们违抗拿破仑的命令。她们也被处决了。随后一只鹅上前交代，说他在去年收割季节时曾偷偷私藏了六穗谷子，并在夜里吃掉了。后来又有一只绵羊坦白，说她曾向饮水池里撒过尿，她声称是雪球迫使她这么干的。此外两只羊坦白他们曾经谋杀了一只老公羊，他是拿破仑的一位忠心不贰的追随者。他们杀害他的手段是，在他正患咳嗽时，追赶着他围着火堆一直转来转去。这些动物都被当场杀掉了。坦白和死刑的故事就这样一直继续，直到一堆尸体在拿破仑的脚边堆起，空气中弥漫着浓郁的血腥味。自从赶走琼斯以来，这样的情形还一直没有出现过。

等这一切都结束之后，剩下的动物，除了猪和狗以外，全都挤成一堆悄悄离开了。他们惶恐不安并且极端痛苦，但却弄不清楚到底哪件事情造成的震荡更为厉害——是那些和雪球勾结起来的背叛呢，还是刚才亲眼所见的对这些背叛的残酷的惩罚。过去，和这种恐怖程度相当的屠杀场景也时常发生，然而在他们看来，如今的情况简直糟糕透顶，因为这事就发生在自己同志之间。自从琼斯逃离庄园以来，还没有一个动物杀害过另一只动物，连一只老鼠也未曾被杀。这时，他们已经走上小山包，重建了一半的风车就矗立在那里，动物们不约而同地趴下来，好像是为了取暖而互相挤在一起。除了那只猫外，苜蓿、穆丽尔、本杰明、牛、羊以及一群鹅和鸡全都在这里了。就在拿破仑命令所有动物集合的时候，那只猫突然失踪了。一时间，大家都一言不发，只有拳师还继续站着，他烦躁不安地走来走去，同时用他那长长的黑尾巴不断地抽打着自己的肚皮。偶尔还发出一丝低低的嘶鸣声，表达他的难以接受。最后他说话了：

“我对此感到难以理解，我真是不敢相信这种事会在我们庄园里发生，这一定是由于我们自己的某些过失而造成的。在我看来，要解决这个问题的关键所在就是要更加努力地工作。从今以后，每天早晨我要提前整整一个小时起床。”

他拖着沉重的步子离开了，向着采石场那里走去。到了那儿，他便一口气装了两车石头，并且把它们都拉到风车工地上，然后才回去睡觉。

动物们仍挤在苜蓿身边沉默不语。他们躺在小山包上，在那里，整个乡村景色可以一览无余。动物庄园的绝大部分也都尽收眼底——一直延伸到那条大路的狭长的牧场，翻耕过的地里长着茂密而碧绿的麦苗，草料地、灌木林、饮水池，还有庄园里的红色屋顶和那烟囱里冉冉升起的缕缕炊烟。这是一个万里无云的春天的傍晚，夕阳的余晖给草地和郁郁葱葱的丛林抹上了一层金子般的颜色。他们带着一种惊异的心情忽然想到，这是他们自己的庄园，这里的每一寸土地都是他们自己的财产。这一刻展现在动物们眼前的正是他们心驰神往的地方。苜蓿望着下面的山坡，她的眼中饱含泪水。如果她能用言语表达出她此时的想法，她肯定就会这样说，现在的情形与几年前他们为推翻人类努力奋斗而致力实现的目标大相径庭，这些恐怖和杀戮的惨状，也与在老少校第一次鼓动他们起来造反的那天晚上所热情期盼的相差甚远。关于未来，如果说她还曾设计过什么蓝图，那就一定是这样的一个社会：摆脱了饥饿和鞭子的折磨，所有的动物一律平等，劳动各尽其能，强者保护弱者，如同在少校演讲的那天晚上，她曾经用前腿保护着那些失去了妈妈的小鸭子一般。但现在她百思不得其解，为什么他们现在落入了一个不敢表达自己真实想法的时代，一个凶猛残暴的狗到处咆哮的时代，一个眼睁睁地看着自己的同志在交代了吓人的罪行后被撕成碎片而毫无办法的时代。她头脑里并没有造反或者抗命的念头。她知道，尽管局势如此，他们现在的日子也比在琼斯时期要强多了。再说，他们最为重要的事情还是要防备人类的卷土重来。不管发生什么事情，她都依然忠心赤胆，勤勤勉勉，接受拿破仑的领导，完成交给自己的任务。不过，追根究底，她和所有其他的动物曾期盼并为之辛苦工作的，毕竟不是当前的这种情形；他们建造风车，勇敢地面对琼斯的枪林弹雨，也不是为了过现在的这种生活。这就是她的想法，尽管她还不能准确地描述这种想法。

最后，她感到实在找不到什么合适的言语来表达心中的想法，于是就用唱歌作为替代，开始唱起了《英格兰的牲畜》。围坐在她身边的其他动物跟着唱了起来。他们唱了三遍，唱得非常和谐悦耳，但却缓慢而忧伤。他们从前还从未这样唱过这支歌。

他们刚唱完第三遍，声响器就在两条狗的陪同下来到他们身边，脸上布满了似乎有重大事情要宣讲的神情。他宣布，遵照拿破仑同志的一项特别敕令，《英格兰的牲畜》已经被废除了。从今往后，这首歌禁止再唱。



动物们感到晴天霹雳一般。

“为什么？”穆丽尔大声叫道。

“不再需要了，同志，”声响器冷冰冰地说道。“《英格兰的牲畜》是造反歌。但造反已经成功，今天下午处决一批叛徒便是最后的行动。外部和内部的仇敌都已经被打垮了。过去我们在《英格兰的牲畜》中表达的是对未来一个更为美好的社会的渴望，但这个社会现在已经建立。这首歌显然没有任何价值了。”

动物们虽然被吓得惊恐万状，但是似乎还是有些动物要提出抗议。但偏偏在这个时候，绵羊们大声咩咩地喊起那套“四条腿好，两条腿坏”的老调子，持续了几分钟之久，这场争议也就宣告结束。

于是，再也听不到《英格兰的牲畜》了，取而代之的，是诗人小不点写的另外一首歌，它的开头是：





动物庄园，动物庄园，

我决不会让你受伤！





从此，这首歌就在每个星期天早晨升旗之后唱。但不知为何，在动物们看来，不管是歌词还是曲调，这首歌似乎都无法和《英格兰的牲畜》相媲美。





第八章


几天以后，成批杀害动物引起的恐慌已经消退了，有些动物才记起——至少他们自以为记得——第六条戒律中已经规定：“凡动物一律不准杀害其他动物”。尽管谁也不希望在提及这个话题时让猪和狗听到，但他们还是觉得已经发生的诸多屠杀与戒律的精神不相符合。苜蓿请求本杰明把第六条戒律念给她听一下，可是本杰明却像往常一样说他拒绝掺和到这类事情中去。她又把穆丽尔找来。穆丽尔就给她念了，上面写的是“凡动物一律不准杀害其他动物而无缘由”。对后面这几个字，动物们不知为何已经完全没有印象了。但他们现在却清楚地看到，处死那些与雪球串通一气的叛徒是完全有正当理由的，并没有发生违犯戒律的情况。

整整这一年，动物们比前些年干得更为辛苦。重新建造风车，不但需要把墙筑的厚度增加一倍，还要在规定的期限内完成，再加上庄园里那些常规性的工作，这两个事情放在一起，任务异常艰巨。动物们已经不止一次觉察到，他们现在的劳动时间比琼斯时期长，吃的却并不比那时好。每到星期天早上，声响器总会用蹄子夹着一张长长的纸条，向他们发布各类食物产量增多的数据，根据种类的不同而定，有的增加了百分之二百，有的增加了百分之三百或者百分之五百。动物们认为没有任何理由不相信他，特别是由于他们再也记不清楚造反之前到底是个什么样的状况。不过，他们常常感到，宁愿这些数字减少一些，而能多分到些吃的。

所有的命令现在都是通过声响器或者另外一头猪发布的。拿破仑自己则两星期也难得公开露一次面。一旦他要出现的时候，不仅有他的狗护卫队伴随左右，而且还要有一只黑色小公鸡在前面开道，并且扮演一个号手一样的角色，在拿破仑讲话之前先要响亮地啼叫一遍“喔——喔——喔”。就是在庄园主院子里，据说拿破仑也是与别的猪分开而住单独的套房。他由两只狗侍候着独自用餐，而且通常使用那些陈列在客厅玻璃橱柜里的有英国王冠标志的德比瓷器。另外还正式宣布，每年在拿破仑生日那天，也要鸣枪以示庆祝，就像另外两个纪念日一样。



如今，谈起拿破仑时，不能随随便便地称呼“拿破仑”了。不管什么时候谈起他时都必须用正式的尊称“我们的领袖拿破仑同志”，而那些猪还喜欢给他冠以诸如“动物之父”、“人类克星”、“羊的保护神”、“鸭子的亲朋”等等这样一些头衔。声响器每次演讲时，总要泪流满面地大谈特谈拿破仑的智慧如何卓越超群，他的心肠如何仁慈善良，说他深爱着任何地方的动物，特别是对那些其他庄园里还生活在受歧视和受奴役境况下的不幸动物满怀着深深的爱，等等。在庄园里，每取得一项成就，每遇到一件幸运之事，所有这些荣誉都要归功于拿破仑，已经成为惯例。你常常可以听到一只母鸡对另一只母鸡这样讲道：“在我们的领袖拿破仑同志的指引下，我在六天里产了五只蛋。”或者两头牛正在池边饮水时会感叹：“多亏拿破仑同志的英明领导，这水喝起来真甜！”庄园里的动物们的普遍感受充分体现在一首名为《拿破仑同志》的诗中。诗是小不点创作的，全诗如下：





孤儿的亲朋！

幸福的源泉！

恩赐食物的上帝！

您那镇定威仪的双目

犹如天上的太阳，

每当我仰望着您

啊！我心中满怀激情

拿破仑同志！





是您赐予

您那一切生灵的至爱，

每日饱餐两顿，

还有那洁净的干草可以打滚，

所有的生灵不论大小，

都能在窝棚中安然入睡，

仰仗您的守护，

拿破仑同志！





我若有一头襁褓中的小猪，

不等他长大，

哪怕他才奶瓶般大，擀面棍儿般长，

他就应该懂得

永远对你忠心耿耿，

对，

他发出的第一声尖叫一定是

——“拿破仑同志！”





拿破仑对这首诗相当满意，并让手下把它刻在大谷仓的墙上，与“七诫”遥遥相望。诗的上方是用白漆画成的一幅拿破仑侧身肖像画，它出自声响器的手笔。

这个时期，由温普尔从中牵线，拿破仑正在与弗雷德里克及皮尔金顿进行复杂的谈判。那堆木材到现在仍旧没有卖出。在这两个庄园主中，弗雷德里克更急于得到这批货，但他又不肯出一个公道的价钱。与此同时，又有谣言开始流传，说弗雷德里克和他的伙计们正在密谋袭击动物庄园并捣毁风车，因为风车的建造已经让他妒火中烧。有消息称雪球就藏在平彻菲尔德庄园。仲夏时节，动物们非常震惊地得知，有三只鸡主动坦白交代，说他们曾在雪球的唆使下，参与过一个谋杀拿破仑的阴谋。三只鸡立刻被处决了。随后，为了拿破仑的安全起见，又采取了新的防范举措，四条狗夜间守卫在他的床边，每个床脚一条狗，而一头名叫红眼睛的小猪，领受了在拿破仑吃饭前品尝那些他享用的食物的任务，以防被谁下毒。

差不多也就在那个时候，动物们得到通知，说拿破仑准备把那堆木材卖给皮尔金顿先生；他还打算在动物庄园和福克斯伍德庄园之间就某些产品的交换与皮尔金顿先生签订一项长期协议。尽管双方的交易都是通过温普尔进行的，但拿破仑和皮尔金顿现在的关系差不多是相当友好了。动物们并不信任皮尔金顿，因为他是人。但他们更不信任他们既怕又恨的弗雷德里克，与之相比，他们更愿意和皮尔金顿打交道。随着夏天的逐渐逝去，风车工程也接近尾声，有关一次即将发生的突然袭击的风声也越来越紧。有传言说，弗雷德里克打算带二十个全副武装的人来袭击庄园的动物，而且他早已买通地方官员和警察，这样，只要他能把动物庄园的地契弄到手，这些官员和警察就不再过问此事。此外，许多可怕的消息不断从平彻菲尔德庄园传出，说弗雷德里克正在他的动物身上做各种残酷无情的实验。他曾用鞭子抽死了一匹衰老的马，他让他的那些牛挨饿，还把一条狗扔进了火炉里活活烧死；每天晚上，他就把剃刀刀片绑在公鸡爪子上，让他们互相打斗来取乐。听到竟然有人如此迫害他们的同志们，动物们个个怒不可遏，热血沸腾，他们不时叫嚷着要倾巢而动去进攻平彻菲尔德庄园，把那里的人全部撵走，解放那里的所有动物。但声响器劝告动物们，要避免鲁莽行动，要充分信任拿破仑同志的智谋策略。

尽管如此，反对弗雷德里克的情绪还是不断高涨。在一个星期天早上，拿破仑出现在大谷仓，他向大家解释说他从来没有想过要把那堆木材卖给弗雷德里克。他说，和那种无赖进行交易有损他的尊严。为了对外散播造反消息而放出去的鸽子，以后严禁在福克斯伍德庄园的任何地方落脚。并且下令把他们以前的口号“打倒人类”改为“干掉弗雷德里克”。到了夏季快结束的时候，雪球的另一条诡计又被揭穿了，收获的小麦中布满了杂草，结果发现那原来是雪球在某个夜晚溜进庄园后，把草籽掺进了粮种。一只曾秘密参与此阴谋的公鹅向声响器坦白了这一罪行，随后，他立即就吞食了剧毒浆果自杀身亡了。动物们现在还了解到，雪球从来没有像他们至今还相信的那样获得过“一级动物英雄”的嘉奖。这是一个彻头彻尾的谣传，它是在牛棚战役后不久，由雪球自己散布的。这个压根就没有被授勋的家伙，倒是由于他在战斗中怯懦的表现而早就遭到大伙的谴责。有些动物再一次感到难以理解，但声响器很快就使他们相信是他们的记忆出了问题。

秋天来了，由于庄稼的收割与风车的建造几乎同时进行，动物们不得不鼓足干劲，竭尽全力，最终使风车完工了。接下来还需要安装机器设备，温普尔正在为购买设备的事四处与人谈判，但是风车的主体结构部分已经建成。不管他们经历的每一步如何艰难，不管他们的经验多么缺乏，设备多么简陋，运气多么不佳，雪球的阴谋多么险恶，整个工程还是一天也没有延误地如期竣工了！动物们精疲力竭，但却感到无比的自豪，他们绕着他们自己的这一杰作走了一圈又一圈。在他们看来，风车比第一次建成时更加漂亮了，此外，墙体也比第一次的厚了一倍。这一次，除非使用炸药，否则休想摧毁它们！是啊，他们为此不知浇灌过多少心血和汗水，战胜了不知多少困难和挫折，而一旦风车的翼板转动起来，发电机开始运转之时，他们的生活将会发生多么巨大的改观！——当他们想到所有这一切，动物们的疲劳立即就消失得无影无踪了，而且还一边连连发出胜利之声，一边雀跃不已地围着风车转个不停。拿破仑由九条狗和一只小公鸡陪同着，亲临现场视察，并以他个人的名义对动物们取得的成就表示祝贺，还宣布，风车将命名为“拿破仑风车”。



两天之后，动物们被召集到大谷仓召开一次特别会议。拿破仑宣布，他已经把那堆木材出售给了弗雷德里克，弗雷德里克的车队明天就要来到这里，开始把木材拉走。顿时，动物们无异于当头挨了一棒，惊讶万状。在整个这段时间内，拿破仑表面上与皮尔金顿似乎非常友好，其实他一直与弗雷德里克有来往，并且早已达成了秘密协议。

与福克斯伍德庄园的一切关系都已彻底断绝，他们向皮尔金顿发出了很多侮辱性的信件。那些鸽子被告知以后要避开平彻菲尔德庄园，还把“干掉弗雷德里克”的口号改为“干掉皮尔金顿”。与此同时，拿破仑向动物们担保，说所谓动物庄园面临着一个即将到来的袭击的消息完全是凭空捏造的，另外，关于弗雷德里克虐待他自己动物的传言，也是被无限地夸张了的。所有这些谣言都很有可能源于雪球和他的同伙。总之，现在表明雪球并没有藏身于平彻菲尔德庄园。实际上他这辈子根本没有去过那里，他正住在福克斯伍德庄园，据说过着骄奢淫逸的生活。而且过去的那么多年里，他一直就是皮尔金顿门下的一个名副其实的食客。

那些猪对于拿破仑的精明无不感到欣喜若狂。看起来他与皮尔金顿似乎友好相处，通过这一招就迫使弗雷德里克把报价提高了十二英镑。声响器说，拿破仑思想的英明卓越之处，真正体现在他不信任任何一个人，即使对弗雷德里克也同样如此。弗雷德里克原本准备用一种叫做支票的东西支付木材钱，那玩意儿看起来就像一张纸，上面写着保证付款之类的承诺，但拿破仑太聪明了，岂能被他欺骗。他要求弗雷德里克用真正的五英镑面额的钞票支付货款，而且必须先交钱，而后才能拉走木材。弗雷德里克已经付清了货款，他所支付的数额正好够用来购买风车所需的机器设备。



这期间，木材极其神速地被运走。等到全部拉完之后，在大谷仓里又召开了一次特别会议，让动物们检阅一番弗雷德里克交来的那些钞票。拿破仑笑容可掬，满心欢喜，他胸前佩戴着他的两枚勋章，端坐在那个平台上的一张草垫子上，钱就在他身旁，整齐地码在从庄园主院子的厨房里拿来的一只瓷盘子上。动物们排成一行缓缓走过，一个个全神贯注地要看个够。拳师还把鼻子伸过去嗅了嗅那钞票，轻薄的白纸片在他呼吸的搅动下，发出轻微的嘶嘶声。

三天之后，发生了一阵可怕的骚乱。温普尔脸色如死人一般苍白，骑着他的自行车沿着小路飞快赶来。他把自行车往院子里一扔，就直奔庄园主院子。没过多大一会儿，就从拿破仑的房间里传出了一阵似乎将要窒息的狂怒的吼叫声。关于出事的消息像野火一般在整个庄园蔓延开来。钞票竟是假的！弗雷德里克没花一分一毫就把木材拉走了！

拿破仑立即召集起所有的动物，以极度可怕的声音宣布判处弗雷德里克死刑。他说，如果抓住了弗雷德里克，非把他活活煮死不可。与此同时，他警告大家说，继这个背信弃义的奸诈行动之后，最糟糕的事情也即将发生。弗雷德里克和他的伙计们随时都可能发动他们谋划了很长时间的袭击。因此，所有通向庄园的路口都已经布下了岗哨。另外，四只鸽子也被派往福克斯伍德庄园，送去一封和好的信件，希望能与皮尔金顿和好如初。

就在第二天早晨，敌人的进攻开始了。当时动物们正在吃早餐，守望员飞奔来报，说弗雷德里克已经带领手下走进了五闩大门。动物们十分英勇，立刻前去迎击敌人，不过这一回他们可没能像牛棚战役那样轻而易举地获取了胜利。敌方这一次共有十五个人，带了六支枪，当动物们距离他们还有五十码的时候就马上开火。动物们根本抵挡不住可怕的枪声和造成刺痛的子弹，虽然拿破仑和拳师费了很大的劲才把他们聚集起来，可不一会儿他们就又被击退。他们中的一部分动物已经负伤。他们只好纷纷逃进庄园的窝棚里躲避起来，从墙缝和木板上的节疤孔中小心翼翼地往外探望。只见整个大牧场包括风车在内都已经落到敌人手中。此时甚至连拿破仑也似乎有些惊慌失措。他默不作声，来回踱步，尾巴变得僵硬，而且还不停抽搐着。期盼的目光不时向着福克斯伍德庄园方向投去。要是皮尔金顿和他手下的人能够前来支援，今天还有可能转败为胜。但就在这时，前一天派出的四只鸽子飞回来了，其中有一只捎来皮尔金顿的一张小纸条。纸上用铅笔写着四个字：“你们活该”。

与此同时，弗雷德里克一帮人已在风车周围停了下来。动物们一边窥探着他们，一边惊慌绝望地小声议论起来。他们中间的两个人拿出一根钢钎和一把大铁锤。他们准备拆毁风车。

“不可能！”拿破仑喊道。“我们已把墙砌得足够厚。一个星期内他们也休想拆除它。勇敢点，同志们！”

但本杰明仍在全神贯注地注视着那些人的一举一动。拿着钢钎和大铁锤的那两个人，正在靠近风车底部的墙上打孔。最后，本杰明带着有点戏弄的神态，慢慢悠悠地上下摆动着他那长长的嘴巴。

“我早就猜到他们会这么干，”他说。“你们没看见他们正在做什么吗？过一会儿，他们就要把炸药塞进孔里去。”

动物们吓得魂不附体，他们只有静观其变，因为此刻从窝棚中冒险冲出去已经是不可能的了。过了一会儿，可以看见那些人朝四下跑开，随着而来的就是一声震耳欲聋的爆炸声。鸽子们就立刻飞到空中，其他动物，除了拿破仑外，全都猛然趴倒在地，把脸藏起来。等他们重新站起来时，只见一团巨大的黑色云团笼罩在风车原来位置的上空。微风慢慢地把云团吹散。风车已不复存在！



看到这幅画面，动物们又重新鼓起了勇气。他们在片刻之前所感到的胆怯和绝望，此时已淹没在由这种可耻卑鄙的行为所激起的狂怒之中。一阵有力的复仇呐喊猛然响起，动物们来不及等下一步的命令，便全体一致地径直扑向敌人。这一次，他们顾不上理会那些犹如冰雹一般无情的子弹在他们头上呼啸而过。这是一场残酷、惨烈的战斗。那帮人在一直不停地开枪，等到动物们与他们距离很近时，他们就舞动棍棒乱打，并抬起沉重的靴子猛踢。一头牛、三只羊以及两只鹅惨遭杀害，差不多每一只动物都受了伤。就连一直在后方指挥作战的拿破仑，尾巴尖也被子弹削去了一小块。但那些人也并非安然无恙。其中三个人的头被拳师的蹄掌踢破；另一个人的腹部被一头牛的犄角抵破；还有一个人，裤子差点被杰西和蓝铃铛扯掉。作为拿破仑贴身侍卫的那九条狗，奉命在树篱的遮掩下迂回包抄，突然出现在敌人的侧翼，气势汹汹地狂吠起来，把那帮人吓得魂飞魄散。他们发觉自己有被包围的危险，弗雷德里克趁退路还在就大喊他的同伙撤离。不到一会儿，那些贪生怕死的敌人便纷纷逃命了。动物们把他们一直追到地界边上，而且在他们从那片荆棘树篱中夺路而逃时，动物们还踢了他们最后几脚。



动物们获胜了，但他们每一个都是筋疲力尽，鲜血淋漓。他们一瘸一拐地朝庄园慢慢地走去。看到横躺在草地上死去的同志们，有的动物悲伤得泪流满面。他们在那个原先矗立着风车的地方肃穆地停留了好大一会儿。是的，风车消失了，就连他们艰辛拼搏的最后一点痕迹也消失了！甚至地基也有一部分被毁坏了。而且这一回要想再建风车，也不能如同上回那样还有坍塌的石头可以利用。这一回连石头也不见了。爆炸的威力把石头抛到了几百码以外，好像这里从来未曾有过风车一样。

当他们快走进庄园时，声响器蹦蹦跳跳地迎上前来。在这次战斗中，他一直莫名其妙地不见踪影。但是此时他却满意地微笑着，不停地摇动着他的尾巴。与此同时，动物们听到一阵庄重的鸣枪声从庄园的窝棚那边传来。

“开枪干什么？”拳师问。

“庆祝我们的胜利啊！”声响器欢叫道。

“什么胜利？”拳师问。他的膝盖还在流血，又弄丢了一个马蹄铁，蹄子也绽开了一道口子，另外他的后腿足足挨了十二颗子弹。

“什么胜利？同志们，难道我们没有从我们的土地上——从动物庄园神圣的土地上把敌人赶跑吗？”

“可是他们毁坏了风车，而我们却为建造风车整整干了两年啊！”

“这有什么关系？我们将重新建造一座。只要我们乐意，我们就建它六座风车。同志们，你们还没有意识到，我们已经干了一件多么伟大的事情。我们脚下这块土地曾经被敌人占领。而现在呢，多亏拿破仑同志的英明领导，我们把每一寸土地重新又夺了回来！”

“可是我们夺回的只不过是原先就属于我们的，”拳师说道。

“这就是我们的胜利，”声响器说。

他们一瘸一拐地走进了院子。击中拳师一条后腿的那些子弹给他带来了剧烈的疼痛。他知道，摆在他面前的工作，将是一项从打地基开始的重建风车的艰苦劳动，他还想象着自己已经为这项任务迅速做好了准备。但是，他头一回想起自己已经十一岁了，他那强壮的肌肉恐怕已经不可与当年相提并论了。

然而，当动物们看到那面绿旗迎风飘扬，听到猎枪再度鸣响——总共响了七下，听到拿破仑祝贺他们的英勇行为的贺词时，他们似乎觉得，他们毕竟还是取得了一场巨大的胜利。大家为在战斗中牺牲的动物举行了一场隆重的葬礼。拳师和苜蓿拉着作为灵车的四轮运货车，拿破仑亲自走在送葬队列的最前头。整整花了两天的时间用来举行歌咏、演讲以及必不可少的鸣枪等庆祝活动，给每一个动物都发放了一只苹果作为特别的礼物，给每只家禽分发了两盎司谷子，给每条狗赐予了三块饼干。这场战斗被宣布命名为风车战役，拿破仑还创立了一个新的勋章——绿旗勋章，并且已经颁发给了他自己。在全体欢庆之中，那个不幸的钞票事件也已被忘却。

庆祝活动过去几天之后，猪们无意间在庄园主院子的地下室里发现了一箱威士忌。这在他们刚进驻这栋住宅时并没有注意到。当天晚上，从庄园主院子那边传出一阵嘹亮的歌声，令每一只动物都大为惊奇的是，其中也夹杂着《英格兰的牲畜》的旋律。大概在九点半左右，有动物清楚地看见，拿破仑戴着一顶琼斯先生的旧圆顶礼帽走出后门，围着院子飞快地奔跑了一圈，又闪进门内不见了。但在第二天早晨，庄园主院子内却是一片深深的寂静，没看到一头猪走动。差不多九点钟时，声响器露面了，步履缓慢，垂头丧气，目光呆滞，尾巴有气无力地拖在身后，全身上下透露出病入膏肓的特征。他把动物们召集到一起，告诉他们有一个沉痛的消息需要发布：拿破仑同志病危！



一阵哀悼的哭声随即而起。庄园主院门外铺了干草，动物们从那里走过时都踮着蹄尖。他们眼中含着泪花彼此之间相互询问：万一他们的领袖拿破仑离开了，他们该怎么办？庄园里此刻到处都在传播着一则小道消息，认为雪球费尽心机想把毒药掺到拿破仑的食物中最终还是得逞了。十一点钟，声响器出来又发布了一项公告。作为他在弥留之际的最后一个举措，拿破仑同志宣布了一道神圣的法令：饮酒者必须处以死刑。

不过到了晚上，拿破仑的病情好像有些好转；第二天早上，声响器就已经告诉他们，说拿破仑正在顺利地走向康复。到了那天晚上，拿破仑已经恢复工作了。又过了一天，动物们才得知，他曾指示温普尔到威灵顿购买了一些小册子，都是关于蒸馏及酿造酒类方面的。一个星期后，拿破仑下令，把苹果园那边的一片小牧场加以翻耕。那片牧场原本想要作为退休动物放牧场的，现在却说牧场地力已经耗尽，需要重新播种；但没过多久便水落石出了，拿破仑意欲在那片牧场播种大麦。



大概就在这段时间，发生了一件几乎让每个动物都难以理解的怪事。一天夜里大约十二点钟的时候，院子中传来一声巨大的跌落声，动物们都纷纷冲出他们各自的畜栏去看。那是一个明月当空的夜晚，在写着“七诫”的大谷仓墙角下，横着一把断成两半的梯子，一时昏迷不醒的声响器正平躺在梯子旁边。在他手边放有一盏马灯，一把漆刷，一罐泼了一地的白漆。几条狗立刻就把声响器围了起来，待他刚刚可以走路，便护送他回到了庄园主院子里。除了老本杰明以外，所有的动物都弄不明白这是怎么回事。本杰明一副心知肚明的神情上下摆动着他的长嘴巴，似乎已经领会了其中的秘密，但他什么都没有说。

但是没过几天，穆丽尔在自己给自己读“七诫”时，注意到其中还有另外一条戒律动物们也都记错了。他们原本认为第五条戒律是“凡动物一律不准饮酒”，但他们都忘了那儿还有两个字，那条戒律实际上是这样的：“凡动物一律不准饮酒过量。”





第九章


拳师蹄子上的裂口过了很长时间还在愈合之中。庆祝胜利的活动结束后的第二天，动物们就开始了风车的重建工程。拳师拒绝闲下来，哪怕一天不工作都不行，而且为了荣誉起见，不让别的动物察觉他带着伤痛干活。到了晚上他私下告诉苜蓿，他的蹄子让他疼痛难忍。苜蓿就把草药嚼烂敷在他的蹄子上。她和本杰明一起劝告拳师干活别那么拼命。她对他说：“一个马的肺是不能这样长期持续下去的。”但是拳师听不进去，他说，他还有唯一一个真切的志向尚未实现——在他达到退休岁数的时候，看到风车顺利运转起来。



想当初，当动物庄园的律法第一次制定时，退休年龄分别规定为：马和猪十二岁，牛十四岁，狗九岁，羊七岁，鸡和鹅五岁。并且商定要发给充足的养老津贴。虽然迄今为止还没有哪个动物真正靠养老津贴生活，但最近关于这个话题的讨论越来越多了。由于苹果园那边的那一片小牧场已被作为大麦田而空出来，就又有传言说大牧场的一角将要围起来改为退休动物的放牧场。据说，每匹马的养老津贴为每天五磅谷子，到了冬天每天为十五磅干草，公共节假日里还发放一根胡萝卜，或者还可能分发一只苹果。到了来年的夏末，拳师就满十二岁了。

那段时间的生活异常艰苦。冬天和去年一样寒冷，食物的短缺更加严重。除了那些猪和狗以外，所有动物的饲料份额又一次被削减。声响器解释说，在饲料问题上过于教条的平均与动物主义的原则是背道而驰的。不论在什么情况下，他都轻而易举地向其他动物证明，不管表面情况看起来怎样，他们的粮食事实上并不短缺。当然，暂时有必要对粮食供应量做一些调整（声响器通常称这是“调整”，绝不认为是“减少”）。但与琼斯时代相比，还是取得了巨大的进步。声响器用他那尖细的嗓音飞快地念了一大串数字，非常详尽地向大家证明，与琼斯时代相比，他们现在拥有了更多的燕麦、更多的干草以及更多的萝卜，工作的时间更短了，饮用的水质变好了，寿命延长了，后代的存活率提高了，窝棚里有了更多的干草，而且跳蚤的侵扰也减少了。动物们对他所说的每句话都深信不疑。说实话，琼斯及琼斯所代表的一切，差不多从他们的记忆中彻底消失了。他们清楚如今的生活非常窘困，几乎难以填饱肚皮，常常是饥寒交迫，他们不睡觉的时候就是一直在干活。但确定无疑的是，过去的日子更为糟糕。他们乐意相信这些。另外，在过去的日子中他们遭受奴役，而现在却享有自由。最后，声响器绝不会忘记指出，这一点才是至关重要的。

现在有更多的动物需要饲养。秋天，四头母猪差不多同时都下小崽，一共产了三十一头小猪。这些小猪都是花斑猪。由于拿破仑是庄园里唯一的种猪，也就不难猜出他们的身世。动物们已经看到公告说，过一段时间，等把砖头和木材都买齐了，就在庄园主院子的花园里为他们盖一间教室。目前，暂时由拿破仑在院子的厨房里亲自教育培训他们。这些小猪平常在花园里做健身活动，并且不准他们和别的年幼的动物一起玩耍。大约也就在这个时候，又制定了一条新规矩：当一头猪与任何其他的动物在路上相遇时，其他动物就必须要站到路边；同样，所有的猪，不论地位如何，一概享有星期天在尾巴上系饰带的特权。



庄园这一年取得了相当不错的收成，但是，他们的资金还是很紧张。盖教室所需要的砖头、沙子和石灰都必须花钱去买，另外也必须开始积攒为购买风车所需的机械设备的资金。庄园主院子需要的灯油和蜡烛，拿破仑自己享用的糖（他严禁别的猪吃糖，理由是吃糖会让他们发胖），也需要不少的资金。再加上所有日常使用的易耗品，诸如工具、钉子、绳子、煤、铁丝、铁块和狗食饼干等等，也是一笔不小的开支。一个干草垛和土豆收成的一部分已经卖掉，鸡蛋供应合同的数量已经增加到每周六百枚。因而在这一年中，母鸡孵出的小鸡数量几乎没法使鸡的总数量保持原有的水平。动物的口粮在十二月份已经减少过一次，二月份又削减了一次，为了节省灯油，窝棚里也禁止点灯。不过猪们的生活似乎过得很滋润，即使存在上述情况，事实上他们的体重仍在增加。二月末的一天下午，一股新鲜、浓郁、令他们馋涎欲滴的香味从厨房旁边的酿酒房里隔着院子飘过来，那间酿酒房在琼斯时期就已废弃不用了。对动物们来说，这种香味是从来没有闻过的。有动物说这是蒸煮大麦的味道。他们贪婪地猛吸着这股香气，心里都在暗自揣测是不是在熬一锅热乎乎的大麦糊糊给他们当晚餐。但是热乎乎的大麦糊糊没有出现，紧接着的那个星期天居然又宣布了一个通告，说是从今以后所有的大麦都要留存下来给猪们。而在此之前，苹果园旁边的一块地里就早已种上了大麦。很快又有消息传出来，说现在每头猪每天都有一品脱啤酒的配额，拿破仑自己则单独享用半加仑，一般都是盛在有英国王冠标志的带盖汤碗里。

但是，不管有多少的艰难困苦需要忍受，只要一想到他们现在的生活比过去要高贵得多，他们也就认为差不多还说得过去。如今歌声多了，演讲多了，游行多了。拿破仑已经下令，每周必须举行一次名为“自发游行”的活动，目的在于庆祝动物庄园的斗争和胜利。一到指定时间，动物们便纷纷放下手头的工作，以军队队形绕着庄园的地界齐步前进，由那些猪带头，然后是马，其后是牛，接着是羊，殿后的是家禽。狗位于队伍的两侧，而拿破仑的那只黑色小公鸡则位于所有的动物之首。拳师和苜蓿还通常扯着一面标记着蹄子和犄角的绿旗，上面还写着“拿破仑同志万寿无疆！”的标语。游行结束之后，是赞颂拿破仑的诗歌朗诵活动，接着由声响器做关于最新的粮食增产数据的报告，而且偶尔还要鸣枪以示祝贺。绵羊们是“自发游行”活动最为热心的拥护者，如果哪个动物表示不满（当没有猪和狗在近处时，个别动物就会如此），说这纯属浪费时间，并且还要长时间地站在寒风中等等，那么绵羊们就肯定会来上一阵“四条腿好，两条腿坏”的气势凶猛的叫声，顿时就让那些动物们无话可说。但一般说来，动物们对搞这些庆祝活动还是兴趣十足的。归根结底，正是这些庆祝活动才使他们满心欢喜地认识到自己真正是当家做主了，并且他们所做的一切都是为了他们自己的利益。因而，在嘹亮的歌声中，在浩浩荡荡的游行队列中，在声响器列举的一连串数字中，在不断的鸣枪声中，在黑公鸡的啼叫声中，在绿旗的迎风飘扬中，动物们就可以忘却他们的肚子还是空荡荡的，至少在部分时间里是这样的。



四月份，动物庄园宣告成为“共和国”，那么选举一位总统就显得非常必要了。候选人只有一个，即拿破仑，他被全体一致地选举为总统。就在同一天，据说又发现了一些新文件，这些证据进一步披露了有关雪球和琼斯相互勾结的细节。现在看来，雪球不仅仅像动物们原来想象的那样，企图通过各种阴谋诡计来输掉牛棚战役，而且还站在琼斯那边公然与大家为敌。事实上，他才是那支人类队伍的首领，并且高呼着“人类万岁”冲进了混战现场。一部分动物仍记得曾看到过雪球背上的伤痕，但实际上那是拿破仑咬破的。

仲夏时节，乌鸦摩西在消失数年之后忽然又在庄园出现。他完全没有变化，依然是不干活，依然用那副不变的语气讲述蜜饯山的故事。他蹲在一根树桩上，拍打着他的黑翅膀，要是谁愿意听，他就滔滔不绝地讲起来。“在那里，同志们，”他郑重其事地讲道，并用他的大嘴朝天空一伸——“在那里，就在你们看得见的那团乌云的另外一边——那儿有座蜜饯山。那个幸福的国度将是我们这些可怜的动物永远摆脱了劳作之后的归宿！”他甚至声称他曾在一次高空翱翔中到过那里，并看到了那里永久鲜嫩的苜蓿地，还有树篱上直接长出的亚麻子饼和方糖。许多动物相信了他。他们推想，他们现在的生活食不果腹，疲惫不堪，那么别处存在着一个比这儿好得多的世界难道不是情理之中的吗？难以确定的倒是猪们对待摩西的态度，他们全都以不屑的口吻声明他那些蜜饯山的说法纯属一派谎言，但是他们仍然准许他留在庄园，准许他不干活，每天还分发给他七分之一升的啤酒作为补贴。

拳师在蹄掌痊愈之后，干活比任何时候都更加卖力。其实，在这一年，所有的动物都像奴隶一般劳作。庄园里除了那些日常工作和风车重建工程的事情外，还要给小猪们建教室，这一工程是在三月份开始的。有时候在饥肠辘辘的情形下长时间劳动的确难以忍受，但是拳师从不蹒跚踉跄。他的言行举动没有任何迹象表明他的气力不如从前，只是外貌发生了小小的变化：他的皮毛没有从前那样富有光泽，粗壮的臀部和大腿上部似乎也收缩松垮了。有的动物说：“等春草长出来时，拳师就会强壮起来。”然而，春天来了，拳师却并没有长胖。有时，他用尽全身气力顶着那些巨石压身的重量，把一块大石头沿着斜坡往矿顶上拉的时候，支撑他的力量仿佛只剩下坚持不懈的意志了。每当这种时刻，可以看到他的嘴唇一动一动，似乎在念叨那句“我要更加努力工作”之外，就一声不吭了。苜蓿和本杰明再度警告他一定要注意身体，但拳师并不放在心上。他的十二岁生日越来越近了。他对其他的事情一概不关心，而满门心思想的只是在他退休之前能积攒起足够多的石头。



夏天的一个傍晚，天色暗下来的时候，有个让大家猝不及防的消息在整个庄园传开，说拳师出事了。在这之前，他曾独自出了马厩，拉了一车石头去了风车的地方。千真万确，这传言是真的。仅仅几分钟后，两只鸽子火速飞回来，带来消息说：“拳师倒下了！他现在正侧躺在那里，站不起来了！”

庄园里大约半数的动物冲了出去，朝建风车的小山包上直奔而去。拳师就躺在那里。他的身体卡在两根车辕之间，伸着脖子，连头也抬不起来，双眼呆滞迷离，腹部已经完全被汗水浸透，嘴里淌出一股细流样的鲜血。苜蓿跪倒在他身边。



“拳师！”她哭喊道，“你怎么啦？”

“我的肺不行了，”拳师的声音有气无力。“没什么要紧的。我想，我不在了，你们照样能建成风车。备用的石头已经积攒很多了。我至多还有一个月的时间了。说句实在话，我一直盼望着能够退休。本杰明也日渐变老了，说不定他们会让他跟我同时退休，可以给我做个伴。”

“我们必须马上得到帮助，”苜蓿说。“快，谁去都行，告诉声响器这儿出事啦。”

其他动物立即全都向庄主院跑去，把这一消息报告给声响器，只有苜蓿和本杰明没去。本杰明躺在拳师身边，默默无言地甩动着他的长尾巴为拳师驱赶苍蝇。大约有一刻钟的时间，声响器满怀着同情和关切出现了。他说拿破仑同志已获悉此事，对庄园里这样一位最忠诚的成员遭遇如此的不幸表示最为深切的难过，而且正在安排，要把拳师送往威灵顿的医院去接受治疗。动物们听说后，心里七上八下，因为除了莫丽和雪球之外，还没有别的动物离开过庄园，他们不愿想到他们的一位患病的同志落入人类的控制之中。然而，声响器轻而易举地说服了他们，他说在威灵顿的兽医能更快地医治好拳师的病，而在庄园里不能做到。差不多半小时过去了，拳师的状况稍稍有些好转，他非常吃力地站起来，挣扎着慢慢走回他的厩棚，苜蓿和本杰明已经在里面给他准备了一个柔软的稻草床。



在接下来的两天中，拳师哪儿也没去，就待在他的厩棚里。猪送来了一大瓶粉红色的药，那是他们在浴室的药柜里找到的，由苜蓿每天两次在饭后给拳师服用。晚上，她躺在拳师的厩棚里和他聊聊天，本杰明则为他驱赶苍蝇。拳师表示对所发生的事并不感到懊悔。倘若他能完全康复，他希望自己还能再活上三年。他盼望着那时候能在大牧场的一角度过一段平静的日子。要是那样，他就能第一次有闲暇时间来学习文化，增益心智。他说，他打算用尽余生的精力去学习字母表上A、B、C、D之外的二十二个字母。

但是，本杰明和苜蓿只能在工作之余来陪伴拳师。而有一天的正中午，一辆大篷货车把拳师给拉走了。当时，动物们正在一头猪的监督下忙着给萝卜除草，忽然，他们非常吃惊地看着本杰明从庄园窝棚那边一路狂奔而来，一边还扯着嗓子大声呼喊。这是大家破天荒地看见本杰明如此激动，实际上，也是头一回看到他疾驰狂奔。“快，快！”本杰明喊叫道。“快来呀！他们要把拳师拉走！”没等猪下命令，动物们全都扔下手中的活计匆忙跑回窝棚去。果然，院子里停着一辆由两匹马拉着的大篷货车，车身上写着字，驾驭者的座位上坐着一个头戴低檐圆礼帽的男人，一副狡猾奸诈的嘴脸。而拳师的厩棚却空着。

动物们把车团团围住。“再见，拳师！”大家异口同声地喊道。“再见！”

“笨蛋！一群笨蛋！”本杰明叫道，一边绕着他们大叫大跳，一边用他的小蹄子不断地跺着地面。“笨蛋！难道你们没看见车身上写着什么吗？”

一下子，动物们全都停止了叫嚷，场面也沉寂下来了。穆丽尔开始拼读上面的那些字。但是本杰明却一把把她推到了旁边，并在死一般的寂静中念道：



“‘威灵顿镇，阿尔弗雷德·西蒙兹，屠马商兼煮胶商。皮革和骨粉的供应商。’你们不清楚那是什么意思吗？他们要把拳师拉到屠马场去！”

所有的动物顿时都号啕大哭起来，场面相当恐怖。就在这时，坐在车上的那个人向他的马身上猛地抽了一鞭，大篷货车轻快地小跑着离开了大院。动物们全都跟在后面，扯着嗓门竭力呼喊。苜蓿硬是挤到了最前面。这时，车子开始加速，苜蓿也试图提起她那粗壮的四肢疾驰狂奔，但是仅仅达到了慢跑的速度。“拳师！”她哭喊道。“拳师！拳师！拳师！”恰好到了这个时候，似乎拳师听到了外面的吵闹声一般，他的面孔，带着一道顺着鼻梁生出的白毛，出现在大篷货车背后的一扇小窗户上。

“拳师！”苜蓿凄厉地哭喊道。“拳师！出来！快出来！他们拉你是要你的命！”

所有的动物也都跟着苜蓿一起哭喊起来：“出来，拳师，快出来！”但大篷货车在不断加速，把他们甩得越来越远了。动物们不能确定拳师到底是否理解了苜蓿喊的那些话的意思。但没过一会儿，他的脸从窗户上消失了，接着一阵巨大的马蹄蹬踏声从车内传出来。他是在竭力踢开一条可以出来的路子。想当年只消几下，拳师就能把这辆车踢成火柴棍儿一样的碎片。可是天啊！他已经完全没有了当年的神力了；没多久，马蹄的蹬踏声越来越微弱，最终消失了。绝望之致的动物们便开始哀求拉车的那两匹马停下来。“同志们，同志们！”他们大声呼喊。“别把你们自己的兄弟拉去送死！”但是那两匹愚蠢的畜生，对将要发生的事情竟然一无所知，只管向后抿起耳朵加速奔跑。拳师的面孔再也没有在窗户上出现过。有的动物倒是想起跑到前面去关上五闩大门，但是已经没用了，眨眼间，大篷货车就已冲出大门，绝尘而去。从此他们再也没有见过拳师。

三天之后，有通告说拳师已经在威灵顿的医院里去世，但是，他已经得到了作为一匹马所能得到的精细入微的照料。是声响器把这一消息传达给其他动物的。他说，在拳师去世之前的最后几小时里，他一直都守护在旁边。



“那是我所见过的最受感动的场景！”他说着抬起他的蹄子抹去一滴泪珠。“我在他的床边一直守候到最后一刻。临终前，他衰弱得连话都说不出来了，他贴近我的耳边低声说道，他唯一遗憾的是在风车完工之前去世了。‘前进，同志们！’他对我耳语道。‘以造反的名义前进，动物庄园万岁！拿破仑同志万岁！拿破仑永远正确。’同志们，这些就是他的临终遗言。”

讲到这里，声响器脸色陡然一变。他沉默了一小会儿，两只小眼睛射出的猜疑的目光把整个会场都扫视了一遍，才继续他的发言。

他说，根据他的了解，在拳师被拉走后，一个荒唐而又不怀好意的谣言在庄园里四处传播。有些动物注意到，拉走拳师的大篷货车上标有“屠马商”印记，竟然言之凿凿地得出拳师被送到屠马场的结论了。他说，几乎难以置信竟然有糊涂到这种地步的动物。他不停地甩动着自己的尾巴跳来跳去，义愤填膺地责问道，仅此一点就能看出，这些动物果真非常了解他们敬爱的领袖拿破仑同志吗？其实，答案再简单不过了，那辆车从前归一个屠马商所有，但兽医院已经把它买了下来，而他们还没有来得及把原来的名字涂掉。正是因为这个原因，才造成了误会。

动物们听完这番话，都长长地舒了一口气。接着声响器继续讲述了拳师临终时的生动细节，他在医院如何受到无微不至的优待，拿破仑是如何为他购置贵重药品而从不考虑价格等等。动物们最后的一些疑虑也都消失得无影无踪了，他们由于自己同志的死而引发的悲伤，也因为想到他至少是幸福地死去而得以缓解。

拿破仑亲自出席了紧接着的那个星期天早晨的会议，并且宣读了一篇哀悼拳师的简短的悼词。他说，由于各种原因，已经不能把他们去世同志的遗体运回庄园安葬了。但他已指示用庄园主院花园里的月桂枝做一个大花圈，送到拳师的墓前。并且猪们还打算在几天之内举行一次向拳师致哀的追悼宴会。拿破仑引用了拳师两句心爱的格言“我要更加努力工作”和“拿破仑同志永远正确”结束了他的讲话。在提到这两句格言时，他说，每个动物都应该把它们作为自己的座右铭，并且认真地去贯彻实行。



到了确定举办宴会的那一天，一辆杂货商的送货马车从威灵顿驶来，把一个大木箱送到了庄园主院子里。当天晚上，院子里传出阵阵喧嚣吵闹的歌声，在此之后，又传出了一种听上去像是在激烈地吵架的声音，直到十一点左右的时候，又是一阵玻璃破碎的可怕声响，之后，才沉寂了下来。第二天中午以前，庄园主院里没有任何动静。同时，又有小道消息在庄园里到处流传，说猪们不知从哪里弄到了一笔钱，又给他们自己买了一箱威士忌。





第十章


几年过去了。春去秋来，岁月流逝，寿命较短的动物都已相继离开了这个世界。如今，除了苜蓿、本杰明、乌鸦摩西和一些猪之外，已经没有谁还能记得造反前的旧日子了。

穆丽尔死了，蓝铃铛、杰西以及钳子都死了。琼斯也离开人世了，他死在国内另外一个地方的一个酒鬼家中。雪球已被遗忘。拳师也被遗忘，唯有为数不多的几个与他相识的动物还记得。苜蓿如今也老了，她身体发福，关节僵硬，眼角总是带着一团眼屎。根据退休年龄规定，她的年龄已超过两岁了，但实际上，从来没有一个动物真正退休。给退休动物留出大牧场一角享用的议题也早已不予过问了。如今的拿破仑已是一头重达三百多磅的成熟的公猪。声响器胖得几乎连睁开眼睛都困难。只有老本杰明，几乎还是过去的模样，只是鼻子和嘴周围的毛色稍稍发灰；还有一点就是自从拳师死去后，他变得越发郁郁寡欢和沉默寡言。



现在，庄园里有了更多的牲畜，尽管增长的幅度并没有早些年所预见的那么大。对于那些后来出生在庄园的动物来说，造反只不过是一个口口相传的模糊难辨的传说而已；而对那些从别处买进的动物来说，他们在来到庄园之前，根本就没有听谁提起过起义的事。现在庄园里除了苜蓿之外，另外还有三匹马。他们都是挺拔强健的好牲畜，也是积极肯干的劳动力和温顺的好同志，可惜都非常愚蠢。他们中间没有一个能够认得字母表上B以后的字母。对于有关造反和动物主义原则的说法，凡是他们能够获悉的，他们都全盘接受，特别是对出自苜蓿之口的。他们对苜蓿满怀近乎孝顺的尊敬。不过，他们究竟能否把那些获悉到的东西弄明白，可就是一个疑问了。

现在的庄园一派繁荣兴旺的景象，也建立了更富有成效的组织。庄园通过从皮尔金顿先生那里买来的两块地扩大了自己的领土面积。风车最终还是完满竣工了，庄园里也拥有了属于自己的一台脱粒机和一台草料升降机。另外，还新建了很多各种各样的建筑物。温普尔也为自己购置了一辆轻便的双轮马车。不过，风车至终都没有用来发电，而是被用来碾磨谷物，并且为庄园带来了丰厚的收益。动物们正在为建造另一座风车而艰辛劳作，据说等这一座建成了将要安装发电机。但是，当年雪球引导动物们所想象的那种奢华生活——有电灯和冷热水齐备的窝棚，每周三天工作制——如今再也不谈论了。拿破仑谴责这些想法是与动物主义的精神背道而驰的。他说，最纯粹的幸福在于勤奋的工作和俭朴的生活。

虽然庄园似乎已经变得富裕了，但不知因为何故，动物们自己一点也没有富裕起来的迹象；当然，猪和狗排除在外。也许，其中的部分原因就在于有那么多的猪和狗。并不是这些动物不劳动，而是他们都以自己的方式从事劳动。正像声响器反反复复地解释的那样，在庄园的监督和组织方面有没完没了的事情要做。在这类事情中，有很多工作是其他动物由于太过无知而难以理解的。例如，声响器告诉他们说，猪们每天要把大量的精力耗费在处理所谓“档案”、“报告”、“会议记录”和“备忘录”等等神秘的事务上面。那些都是大片大片的纸张，必须在上面写满密密麻麻的字迹，而且一旦写满了字，又得把它们放进火炉里烧掉。声响器说，这些对于庄园的幸福安宁起着至关重要的作用。但是迄今为止，不管是猪还是狗，都还没有用他们自己的劳力生产过一粒粮食；而他们却为数众多，胃口还一直非常好。



至于其他动物，就他们目前所知，他们的生活还是一成不变。他们普遍处于饥饿之中，睡的是草垫，喝池塘里的水，劳碌于田间；冬天他们被寒冷侵袭，夏天则是苍蝇的骚扰。有时，他们中间的年长者绞尽脑汁地搜索那些模糊的记忆，他们试图以此来判断在早期造反的日子里，也就是刚赶走琼斯那会儿，状况是比现在好呢，还是比现在糟。他们全都忘记了。没有任何东西可以拿来和现在的生活相比较，除了声响器的一系列数字以外，他们没有任何参照的标准，而声响器的数字总是一直不变地表明，所有的事物正变得越来越好，越来越好。动物们发现这个问题难以解决；无论如何，他们现在几乎没时间去揣测这些事情。唯有老本杰明声称自己那漫长的一生中的每个细节都历历在目，还说他知道事物过去从来没有，将来也绝不会比过去好很多或比过去差很多。因为饥饿、困苦和失望的现实，是生活不容更改的法则，他这样说道。

然而动物们从来没有放弃希望。确切地说，他们从来没有丧失自己作为动物庄园一员的荣誉感和优越感，哪怕是短短的一瞬间也不曾有过。他们的庄园依然是整个国家——全英格兰——唯一属于动物们所有并由动物们管理的庄园。他们中间的任何一个成员，连最年轻的，甚至还有那些来自十英里或二十英里以外的新成员，无不对这一点感到钦佩有加。每当他们听到猎枪的回响声，看到绿旗在旗杆顶端飘扬，他们内心就洋溢着永久的自豪，话题通常就会转向往日的史诗般的岁月，转向琼斯的遭遇驱逐，转向“七诫”的镌刻，以及来犯的人类被击退的那些伟大战役等等。那些昔日的梦想一个也没有忘却。想当年少校预言过的“动物共和国”——英格兰的绿色田野上将不再有人类足迹践踏，至今仍旧是他们坚守的信仰。总有一天，那个预言会成为现实：也许不会很快，也许在现在健在的任何动物的有生之年也不能实现，但它最终会实现的。而且目前甚至连《英格兰的牲畜》的曲子也可能有动物在到处偷偷哼唱，不管怎么说，庄园里的每个动物都知道它总是一个事实，尽管谁也不敢放声高歌。他们的生活也许很艰难，他们的希望也许并没有全部实现，但他们心里很明白，他们跟其他的动物不一样。如果他们依然挨饿，那并非由于把食物拿去喂了残暴的人类；如果他们艰苦劳作，那么至少他们是在为自己干活。他们中谁也不用两条腿行走，没有谁把任何其他的动物称做“主人”。所有的动物一律平等。

夏天来临后不久的一天，声响器指挥一些绵羊跟着他出去，他把他们领到庄园的另一头——一块遍布着桦树苗的荒地。在声响器的监督下，绵羊们在那里啃了足足一整天的树叶。到了傍晚，声响器吩咐绵羊们，说既然天气暖和了，他们就仍留在荒地上吧。然后，他自己独自回到了庄园主院子。结果绵羊们在那里一留就是整整一个星期。这期间，其他的动物连他们的一丝踪影也看不到。声响器每天花费大量的时间和他们待在一起。他解释说，他正在教他们唱一首新歌，因此需要一个秘密的环境。



那是一个愉悦的傍晚，绵羊们回来了。当时，动物们刚结束一天的劳作，正走在返回窝棚的路上，这时，一匹马惊恐的嘶鸣从院子中传出来，动物们惊吓得都立即停下了脚步。那是苜蓿的声音，她又一次嘶叫起来。于是，所有的动物全都撒腿狂奔冲进了大院。然后他们看到了苜蓿所看到的情景。

那是一头猪在用他的后腿走路。

没错，是声响器。他正溜达着穿过院子，稍稍有点笨拙，似乎还不太习惯用这种姿势支撑他那硕大的块头，但他却能保持着近乎完美的平衡。没过多大一会儿，从庄园主院门又走出一长队猪，全都用他们的后腿在行走。他们走得有好有坏，有一两头猪甚至还有点不够稳当，看上去好像他们原本应该有一根棍子支撑着似的。不过，每头猪都相当成功地绕着院子走了一圈。最后，在一阵可怕的狗叫声和那只黑公鸡尖细的啼鸣声中，拿破仑亲自出场了，他威风凛凛地直立着，用傲慢的眼光把全场扫视了一遍。他的狗侍卫们则又蹦又跳地簇拥在他的周围。

他的蹄子中夹着一根鞭子。



一片死一般的寂静。惊讶、恐惧的动物们互相挤成一团，看着那一长列猪绕着院子缓慢地行走。这情形就好像是世界已经完全颠倒了。当他们从最初的震惊中稍稍缓过神的时候，他们不顾一切——不顾他们对狗的恐惧，不顾他们长年累月养成的，不管出了什么事，他们也从不抱怨、从不批评的习惯——他们马上要发出一些表示抗议的话语了。但是，就在这个时候，如同接收到了一个信号似的，所有的绵羊猛然爆发出一阵气势汹汹的咩咩声——

“四条腿好，两条腿更好！四条腿好，两条腿更好！四条腿好，两条腿更好！”

喊叫声不间断地持续长达五分钟。等绵羊们安静下来后，表示抗议的机会已经彻底消失，因为那些猪已经列队走回庄园主院落里了。



本杰明感觉到有一个鼻子碰触着他的肩膀。他转过头一看，是苜蓿。只见她那一双老花的双眼比以往任何时候都要灰暗。她什么也没有说，轻轻地拽他的鬃毛，把他带到写着“七诫”的大谷仓那一头。他们站在那里，凝视着有白色字体的涂过柏油的墙壁足足有一两分钟。

“我的眼睛越来越昏花了，”她终于说话了。“即使在年轻时，我也不能念出那上面写的东西。我怎么觉得这面墙看上去与以往的不一样了。这‘七诫’还是和过去一模一样吗？本杰明？”

只有这一次，本杰明答应打破自己的原则，他把写在墙上的东西念给苜蓿听，如今那面墙上除了一条戒律，已经没有别的东西了。它是这样写着的：



凡动物一律平等

但有些动物比其他动物更加平等





明白了这个，第二天所有在庄园监督干活的猪们蹄子上都夹着一根鞭子就不足为怪了。据悉猪们又给他们自己买了一台无线电收音机，并正在准备安装一部电话，还订阅了《约翰牛报》、《花边新闻报》及《每日镜报》，当然也没什么稀奇；看到拿破仑嘴里叼着一根烟斗在庄园主院子的花园里散步也不用大惊小怪。不，就连猪们把琼斯先生的衣服从衣柜里翻出来穿在自己身上；拿破仑自己已经公然穿上了一件黑上衣和一条猎装裤，还绑上了皮绑腿；他宠爱的一头母猪则穿上琼斯夫人过去常在星期天才穿的一件波纹绸连衣裙。所有这些统统不足为怪。



一周后的一天下午，很多轻便的双轮马车驶进了庄园。一个由邻近一些庄园主组成的代表团应邀来此进行观光考察。他们被带领着参观了庄园的每一个地方。对于看到的每一件事物，特别是对于风车，他们表示了高度的赞赏。那时，动物们正在萝卜地里拔草。他们干得极其认真，几乎一直低着头看着地面，不知道他们是更害怕猪呢，还是更害怕前来参观的人。



那天晚上，从庄园主院子里传来阵阵吵闹的欢笑声和歌唱声。突然间，动物们被这混杂的声音吸引住了。他们深感好奇的是，既然这是动物和人首次在平等关系下聚在了一起，那么究竟会发生什么事呢？于是他们便不约而同地、尽可能地放轻脚步朝着庄园主院的花园里溜去。



到了门口，他们停了下来，多半是由于害怕而不敢再往前走，但苜蓿带头走了进去，他们踮着蹄子走到房子跟前，那些个头很高的动物通过餐厅的窗户往里面张望。屋子里面，在一张长桌周围，坐着六个庄园主和六头地位显赫的猪，拿破仑自己坐在桌子顶端的东道主的位子上。猪们在椅子上显出一副相当舒适自在的姿态。宾主一直都在饶有趣味地打牌，但是后来暂停了一会儿，显然是为了干杯。一把大酒壶在他们中间传来传去，杯子里一直不断地被斟满啤酒。没有哪一个注意到那一张张正透过窗子凝视着里面的惊愕面孔。



福克斯伍德庄园的皮尔金顿先生举着酒杯站起身来。他说，此时此刻，他要和在场的诸位干上一杯。不过在此之前，他觉得有几句话必须先讲一下。

他说，他自己沉浸在一种巨大的欢喜之中——他相信，在座的其他各位也是同样的感受——感觉很长一个时期以来的猜疑和误解现在已经结束。曾有这样一个时期，虽然他自己抑或在座的任何一位都不会认同这种观点，当时，尊敬的动物庄园的所有者曾受到他们的人类邻居的……他情愿说是一定程度上的猜疑，而不是敌视。不幸的事件曾多次发生过，错误的观念也曾流行过。一个归猪所有并由猪管理经营的庄园的存在，多多少少有些不太正常，而且有可能给周边庄园带来不安定的因素。为数众多的庄园主没有做充分的调查就妄下结论说，在这样的庄园里，肯定充斥着一种恣意妄为的歪风邪气。他们为他们自己的动物甚至他们的雇员将会受到这种状况的影响而焦灼不安。但所有这些怀疑如今都已经烟消云散了。今天，他和他的朋友们参观了动物庄园，亲眼考察了庄园的每一个角落。他们发现了什么呢？这里不仅有最现代的操作方法，而且纪律严明，井然有序，这些对各地的庄园主来说都是楷模。他相信，动物庄园的下层动物比全国任何动物干的活都要更多，吃的饭都要更少，这样说是完全正确的。的确，他和他的同行考察团成员们今天看到了许多特色事物，他们打算尽快把这些东西引进到他们自己的庄园中去。

他说，在结束他的讲话的时候，要再次重申，曾经存在于动物庄园与它的邻居之间的友好感情应该继续维持下去。在猪和人之间过去不存在，也不应该存在任何利害冲突。他们的奋斗目标和面临的困难都是一样的。劳工问题在任何地方不都是相同的吗？讲到这里，皮尔金顿先生显然准备抛出一句经过精心琢磨的俏皮话，但有好一会儿他忍俊不禁，以致话也讲不出来。他哽塞了好大一会儿，呈多层状的下巴都憋得发紫了，这句话才最终出口了。“如果你们有你们的下层动物需要对付，”他说，“我们同样有我们的下层阶级！”这绝妙的警句一出，引起四座宾客的一阵哄堂大笑。皮尔金顿先生为他在动物庄园观察到的饲料供应量少、劳动时间长以及普遍没有松垮疲沓的现象等等再次向猪们表示祝贺。

皮尔金顿先生最后说道，现在，他要请在座的各位起立，把他们各自的酒杯都斟得满满的。“先生们，”皮尔金顿先生最后说道，“先生们，我敬你们一杯：为动物庄园的繁荣兴旺干杯！”

这时响起了一片热烈的喝彩声和跺脚声。拿破仑简直欣喜若狂，他离开了自己的座位，绕着桌子走向皮尔金顿先生，和他碰杯之后就一饮而尽。喝彩声平静下来之后，依然靠后腿站立着的拿破仑表示，他也有几句话要讲。

和拿破仑所有的演讲一样，这次讲话简明扼要并直奔主题。他说，他对于那个误解时代的结束也感到非常高兴。曾经长时间流传着这样的谣言，他有理由认为这些谣言是一些居心不良的仇敌散播的，说在他自己以及他同事的观念中，有某种颠覆性甚至是革命性的东西。他们一直被认为企图煽动附近一些庄园的动物起来造反。但是，没有任何东西是能够遮蔽事实真相的。他们唯一的愿望，现在是，过去也是，与他们的邻居们和平相处，保持正常的贸易关系。他补充说，他有幸监管的这个庄园是一家合作性质的企业。由他亲自保管的那张地契，归猪们共同所有。



他说，他相信任何旧的猜疑都不会残存下去了。而前不久对庄园的规章制度又做了一些修订，这将有助于进一步增强彼此的信任。长期以来，庄园里的动物有一个非常愚蠢的习惯，那就是彼此间以“同志”相称。这个以后禁止使用。还有一个极其奇怪的习惯，已经弄不清它的由来，就是在每个星期天早上必须列队走过花园里一个钉在木桩上的公猪头盖骨。这个也要取消。头盖骨已经被掩埋。访问者们应该已经看到那面旗杆顶上飘扬着的一面绿旗。倘若看到的话，他们可能已经注意到原先标记在旗面上的白色蹄掌和犄角现在已经消失了。今后它将是一面全绿的旗。

他说，对于皮尔金顿先生刚才一番精彩而亲切的演讲，他只指正一处。皮尔金顿先生一直提到“动物庄园”，他当然不可能知道，因为甚至他也只是现在第一次宣布，“动物庄园”这个名字取消了。今后，庄园将被称为“曼纳庄园”——他相信，这才是庄园名副其实的名字。

“先生们，”他总结他的发言说，“我将和此前一样给大家以同样的祝词，但要以一种不同的方式，请斟满这一杯。先生们，我的祝词就是：为曼纳庄园的繁荣兴旺干杯！”

和此前一样，又是一阵衷心而热烈的喝彩声，酒杯里全都一滴不剩。但当外面的动物们凝视着这一幅情景时，他们觉得似乎有什么怪事正在发生。猪的面孔上究竟起了什么变化呢？苜蓿衰老昏花的双眼从一个面孔掠过另一个面孔。他们中间的一些有着五个下巴，一些有四个，还有一些有三个。但是究竟是什么东西似乎正在逐渐消失和发生变化呢？这时，热烈的掌声平息了，在座的全部又拿起了扑克牌，继续玩刚才被打断的游戏，外面的动物无声无息地离开了。

但他们还没有走出二十码的距离，又猛地停住了。庄园主院子里传出一阵大吵大闹的喧嚣声。动物们冲了回去，又一次透过窗子往里张望。没错，里面正在进行着一场激烈的争吵。那里面既有大声喊叫的，也有拍打桌子的，有犀利的满是怀疑的目光，有暴怒地矢口否认的。争吵的缘由好像是因为拿破仑和皮尔金顿先生同时都打出了一张黑桃A。

十二个嗓门一齐怒火冲天地吼叫着，他们何其相似！现在，终于明白了猪的面孔上发生了什么变化。窗外的动物们向里张望，目光从猪转移到人，又从人转移到猪，再从猪转移到人；已经不可能分清哪张脸是猪的，哪张脸是人的了。

Chapter I


Mr. Jones, of the Manor Farm, had locked the hen-houses for the night, but was too drunk to remember to shut the popholes. With the ring of light from his lantern dancing from side to side, he lurched across the yard, kicked off his boots at the back door, drew himself a last glass of beer from the barrel in the scullery, and made his way up to bed, where Mrs. Jones was already snoring.

As soon as the light in the bedroom went out there was a stirring and a fluttering all through the farm buildings. Word had gone round during the day that old Major, the prize Middle White boar, had had a strange dream on the previous night and wished to communicate it to the other animals. It had been agreed that they should all meet in the big barn as soon as Mr. Jones was safely out of the way. Old Major (so he was always called, though the name under which he had been exhibited was Willingdon Beauty) was so highly regarded on the farm that everyone was quite ready to lose an hour's sleep in order to hear what he had to say.

At one end of the big barn, on a sort of raised platform, Major was already ensconced on his bed of straw, under a lantern which hung from a beam. He was twelve years old and had lately grown rather stout, but he was still a majestic-looking pig, with a wise and benevolent appearance in spite of the fact that his tushes had never been cut. Before long the other animals began to arrive and make themselves comfortable after their different fashions. First came the three dogs, Bluebell, Jessie, and Pincher, and then the pigs, who settled down in the straw immediately in front of the platform. The hens perched themselves on the window-sills, the pigeons fluttered up to the rafters, the sheep and cows lay down behind the pigs and began to chew the cud. The two cart-horses, Boxer and Clover, came in together, walking very slowly and setting down their vast hairy hoofs with great care lest there should be some small animal concealed in the straw. Clover was a stout motherly mare approaching middle life, who had never quite got her figure back after her fourth foal. Boxer was an enormous beast, nearly eighteen hands high, and as strong as any two ordinary horses put together. A white stripe down his nose gave him a somewhat stupid appearance, and in fact he was not of first-rate intelligence, but he was universally respected for his steadiness of character and tremendous powers of work. After the horses came Muriel, the white goat, and Benjamin, the donkey. Benjamin was the oldest animal on the farm, and the worst tempered. He seldom talked, and when he did, it was usually to make some cynical remark, for instance, he would say that God had given him a tail to keep the flies off, but that he would sooner have had no tail and no flies. Alone among the animals on the farm he never laughed. If asked why, he would say that he saw nothing to laugh at. Nevertheless, without openly admitting it, he was devoted to Boxer; the two of them usually spent their Sundays together in the small paddock beyond the orchard, grazing side by side and never speaking.

The two horses had just lain down when a brood of ducklings, which had lost their mother, filed into the barn, cheeping feebly and wandering from side to side to find some place where they would not be trodden on. Clover made a sort of wall round them with her great foreleg, and the ducklings nestled down inside it and promptly fell asleep. At the last moment, Mollie, the foolish, pretty white mare who drew Mr. Jones's trap, came mincing daintily in, chewing at a lump of sugar. She took a place near the front and began flirting her white mane, hoping to draw attention to the red ribbons it was plaited with. Last of all came the cat, who looked round, as usual, for the warmest place, and finally squeezed herself in between Boxer and Clover; there she purred contentedly throughout Major's speech without listening to a word of what he was saying.

All the animals were now present except Moses, the tame raven, who slept on a perch behind the back door. When Major saw that they had all made themselves comfortable and were waiting attentively, he cleared his throat and began:

"Comrades, you have heard already about the strange dream that I had last night. But I will come to the dream later. I have something else to say first. I do not think, comrades, that I shall be with you for many months longer, and before I die, I feel it my duty to pass on to you such wisdom as I have acquired. I have had a long life, I have had much time for thought as I lay alone in my stall, and I think I may say that I understand the nature of life on this earth as well as any animal now living. It is about this that I wish to speak to you.

"Now, comrades, what is the nature of this life of ours? Let us face it: our lives are miserable, laborious, and short. We are born, we are given just so much food as will keep the breath in our bodies, and those of us who are capable of it are forced to work to the last atom of our strength; and the very instant that our usefulness has come to an end we are slaughtered with hideous cruelty. No animal in England knows the meaning of happiness or leisure after he is a year old. No animal in England is free. The life of an animal is misery and slavery: that is the plain truth.

"But is this simply part of the order of nature? Is it because this land of ours is so poor that it cannot afford a decent life to those who dwell upon it? No, comrades, a thousand times no! The soil of England is fertile, its climate is good, it is capable of affording food in abundance to an enormously greater number of animals than now inhabit it. This single farm of ours would support a dozen horses, twenty cows, hundreds of sheep, and all of them living in a comfort and a dignity that are now almost beyond our imagining. Why then do we continue in this miserable condition? Because nearly the whole of the produce of our labour is stolen from us by human beings. There, comrades, is the answer to all our problems. It is summed up in a single word—Man. Man is the only real enemy we have. Remove Man from the scene, and the root cause of hunger and overwork is abolished for ever.

"Man is the only creature that consumes without producing. He does not give milk, he does not lay eggs, he is too weak to pull the plough, he cannot run fast enough to catch rabbits. Yet he is lord of all the animals. He sets them to work, he gives back to them the bare minimum that will prevent them from starving, and the rest he keeps for himself. Our labour tills the soil, our dung fertilises it, and yet there is not one of us that owns more than his bare skin. You cows that I see before me, how many thousands of gallons of milk have you given during this last year? And what has happened to that milk which should have been breeding up sturdy calves? Every drop of it has gone down the throats of our enemies. And you hens, how many eggs have you laid in this last year, and how many of those eggs ever hatched into chickens? The rest have all gone to market to bring in money for Jones and his men. And you, Clover, where are those four foals you bore, who should have been the support and pleasure of your old age? Each was sold at a year old—you will never see one of them again. In return for your four confinements and all your labour in the fields, what have you ever had except your bare rations and a stall?

"And even the miserable lives we lead are not allowed to reach their natural span. For myself I do not grumble, for I am one of the lucky ones. I am twelve years old and have had over four hundred children. Such is the natural life of a pig. But no animal escapes the cruel knife in the end. You young porkers who are sitting in front of me, every one of you will scream your lives out at the block within a year. To that horror we all must come—cows, pigs, hens, sheep, everyone. Even the horses and the dogs have no better fate. You, Boxer, the very day that those great muscles of yours lose their power, Jones will sell you to the knacker, who will cut your throat and boil you down for the foxhounds. As for the dogs, when they grow old and toothless, Jones ties a brick round their necks and drowns them in the nearest pond.

"Is it not crystal clear, then, comrades, that all the evils of this life of ours spring from the tyranny of human beings? Only get rid of Man, and the produce of our labour would be our own. Almost overnight we could become rich and free. What then must we do? Why, work night and day, body and soul, for the overthrow of the human race! That is my message to you, comrades: Rebellion! I do not know when that Rebellion will come, it might be in a week or in a hundred years, but I know, as surely as I see this straw beneath my feet, that sooner or later justice will be done. Fix your eyes on that, comrades, throughout the short remainder of your lives! And above all, pass on this message of mine to those who come after you, so that future generations shall carry on the struggle until it is victorious.

"And remember, comrades, your resolution must never falter. No argument must lead you astray. Never listen when they tell you that Man and the animals have a common interest, that the prosperity of the one is the prosperity of the others. It is all lies. Man serves the interests of no creature except himself. And among us animals let there be perfect unity, perfect comradeship in the struggle. All men are enemies. All animals are comrades."

At this moment there was a tremendous uproar. While Major was speaking four large rats had crept out of their holes and were sitting on their hindquarters, listening to him. The dogs had suddenly caught sight of them, and it was only by a swift dash for their holes that the rats saved their lives. Major raised his trotter for silence.

"Comrades," he said, "here is a point that must be settled. The wild creatures, such as rats and rabbits—are they our friends or our enemies? Let us put it to the vote. I propose this question to the meeting: Are rats comrades? "

The vote was taken at once, and it was agreed by an overwhelming majority that rats were comrades. There were only four dissentients, the three dogs and the cat, who was afterwards discovered to have voted on both sides. Major continued:

"I have little more to say. I merely repeat, remember always your duty of enmity towards Man and all his ways. Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy. Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend. And remember also that in fighting against Man, we must not come to resemble him. Even when you have conquered him, do not adopt his vices. No animal must ever live in a house, or sleep in a bed, or wear clothes, or drink alcohol, or smoke tobacco, or touch money, or engage in trade. All the habits of Man are evil. And, above all, no animal must ever tyrannise over his own kind. Weak or strong, clever or simple, we are all brothers. No animal must ever kill any other animal. All animals are equal.

"And now, comrades, I will tell you about my dream of last night. I cannot describe that dream to you. It was a dream of the earth as it will be when Man has vanished. But it reminded me of something that I had long forgotten. Many years ago, when I was a little pig, my mother and the other sows used to sing an old song of which they knew only the tune and the first three words. I had known that tune in my infancy, but it had long since passed out of my mind. Last night, however, it came back to me in my dream. And what is more, the words of the song also came back—words, I am certain, which were sung by the animals of long ago and have been lost to memory for generations. I will sing you that song now, comrades. I am old and my voice is hoarse, but when I have taught you the tune, you can sing it better for yourselves. It is called Beasts of England."

Old Major cleared his throat and began to sing. As he had said, his voice was hoarse, but he sang well enough, and it was a stirring tune, something between Clementine and La Cucaracha. The words ran:





Beasts of England, beasts of Ireland,

Beasts of every land and clime,

Hearken to my joyful tidings

Of the golden future time.





Soon or late the day is coming,

Tyrant Man shall be o'erthrown,

And the fruitful fields of England

Shall be trod by beasts alone.





Rings shall vanish from our noses,

And the harness from our back,

Bit and spur shall rust forever,

Cruel whips no more shall crack.





Riches more than mind can picture,

Wheat and barley, oats and hay,

Clover, beans, and mangel-wurzels

Shall be ours upon that day.





Bright will shine the fields of England,

Purer shall its waters be,

Sweeter yet shall blow its breezes

On the day that sets us free.





For that day we all must labour,

Though we die before it break;

Cows and horses, geese and turkeys,

All must toil for freedom's sake.





Beasts of England, beasts of Ireland,

Beasts of every land and clime,

Hearken well and spread my tidings

Of the golden future time.





The singing of this song threw the animals into the wildest excitement. Almost before Major had reached the end, they had begun singing it for themselves. Even the stupidest of them had already picked up the tune and a few of the words, and as for the clever ones, such as the pigs and dogs, they had the entire song by heart within a few minutes. And then, after a few preliminary tries, the whole farm burst out into Beasts of England in tremendous unison. The cows lowed it, the dogs whined it, the sheep bleated it, the horses whinnied it, the ducks quacked it. They were so delighted with the song that they sang it right through five times in succession, and might have continued singing it all night if they had not been interrupted.

Unfortunately, the uproar awoke Mr. Jones, who sprang out of bed, making sure that there was a fox in the yard. He seized the gun which always stood in a corner of his bedroom, and let fly a charge of number 6 shot into the darkness. The pellets buried themselves in the wall of the barn and the meeting broke up hurriedly. Everyone fled to his own sleeping-place. The birds jumped on to their perches, the animals settled down in the straw, and the whole farm was asleep in a moment.





Chapter II


Three nights later old Major died peacefully in his sleep. His body was buried at the foot of the orchard.

This was early in March. During the next three months there was much secret activity. Major's speech had given to the more intelligent animals on the farm a completely new outlook on life. They did not know when the Rebellion predicted by Major would take place, they had no reason for thinking that it would be within their own lifetime, but they saw clearly that it was their duty to prepare for it. The work of teaching and organising the others fell naturally upon the pigs, who were generally recognised as being the cleverest of the animals. Pre-eminent among the pigs were two young boars named Snowball and Napoleon, whom Mr. Jones was breeding up for sale. Napoleon was a large, rather fierce-looking Berkshire boar, the only Berkshire on the farm, not much of a talker, but with a reputation for getting his own way. Snowball was a more vivacious pig than Napoleon, quicker in speech and more inventive, but was not considered to have the same depth of character. All the other male pigs on the farm were porkers. The best known among them was a small fat pig named Squealer, with very round cheeks, twinkling eyes, nimble movements, and a shrill voice. He was a brilliant talker, and when he was arguing some difficult point he had a way of skipping from side to side and whisking his tail which was somehow very persuasive. The others said of Squealer that he could turn black into white.

These three had elaborated old Major's teachings into a complete system of thought, to which they gave the name of Animalism. Several nights a week, after Mr. Jones was asleep, they held secret meetings in the barn and expounded the principles of Animalism to the others. At the beginning they met with much stupidity and apathy. Some of the animals talked of the duty of loyalty to Mr. Jones, whom they referred to as "Master," or made elementary remarks such as "Mr. Jones feeds us. If he were gone, we should starve to death." Others asked such questions as "Why should we care what happens after we are dead?" or "If this Rebellion is to happen anyway, what difference does it make whether we work for it or not?", and the pigs had great difficulty in making them see that this was contrary to the spirit of Animalism. The stupidest questions of all were asked by Mollie, the white mare. The very first question she asked Snowball was: "Will there still be sugar after the Rebellion? "

"No," said Snowball firmly. "We have no means of making sugar on this farm. Besides, you do not need sugar. You will have all the oats and hay you want."

"And shall I still be allowed to wear ribbons in my mane?" asked Mollie.

"Comrade," said Snowball, "those ribbons that you are so devoted to are the badge of slavery. Can you not understand that liberty is worth more than ribbons? "

Mollie agreed, but she did not sound very convinced.

The pigs had an even harder struggle to counteract the lies put about by Moses, the tame raven. Moses, who was Mr. Jones's especial pet, was a spy and a tale-bearer, but he was also a clever talker. He claimed to know of the existence of a mysterious country called Sugarcandy Mountain, to which all animals went when they died. It was situated somewhere up in the sky, a little distance beyond the clouds, Moses said. In Sugarcandy Mountain it was Sunday seven days a week, clover was in season all the year round, and lump sugar and linseed cake grew on the hedges. The animals hated Moses because he told tales and did no work, but some of them believed in Sugarcandy Mountain, and the pigs had to argue very hard to persuade them that there was no such place.

Their most faithful disciples were the two cart-horses, Boxer and Clover. These two had great difficulty in thinking anything out for themselves, but having once accepted the pigs as their teachers, they absorbed everything that they were told, and passed it on to the other animals by simple arguments. They were unfailing in their attendance at the secret meetings in the barn, and led the singing of Beasts of England, with which the meetings always ended.

Now, as it turned out, the Rebellion was achieved much earlier and more easily than anyone had expected. In past years Mr. Jones, although a hard master, had been a capable farmer, but of late he had fallen on evil days. He had become much disheartened after losing money in a lawsuit, and had taken to drinking more than was good for him. For whole days at a time he would lounge in his Windsor chair in the kitchen, reading the newspapers, drinking, and occasionally feeding Moses on crusts of bread soaked in beer. His men were idle and dishonest, the fields were full of weeds, the buildings wanted roofing, the hedges were neglected, and the animals were underfed.

June came and the hay was almost ready for cutting. On Midsummer's Eve, which was a Saturday, Mr. Jones went into Willingdon and got so drunk at the Red Lion that he did not come back till midday on Sunday. The men had milked the cows in the early morning and then had gone out rabbiting, without bothering to feed the animals. When Mr. Jones got back he immediately went to sleep on the drawing-room sofa with the News of the World over his face, so that when evening came, the animals were still unfed. At last they could stand it no longer. One of the cows broke in the door of the store-shed with her horn and all the animals began to help themselves from the bins. It was just then that Mr. Jones woke up. The next moment he and his four men were in the store-shed with whips in their hands, lashing out in all directions. This was more than the hungry animals could bear. With one accord, though nothing of the kind had been planned beforehand, they flung themselves upon their tormentors. Jones and his men suddenly found themselves being butted and kicked from all sides. The situation was quite out of their control. They had never seen animals behave like this before, and this sudden uprising of creatures whom they were used to thrashing and maltreating just as they chose, frightened them almost out of their wits. After only a moment or two they gave up trying to defend themselves and took to their heels. A minute later all five of them were in full flight down the cart-track that led to the main road, with the animals pursuing them in triumph.

Mrs. Jones looked out of the bedroom window, saw what was happening, hurriedly flung a few possessions into a carpet bag, and slipped out of the farm by another way. Moses sprang off his perch and flapped after her, croaking loudly. Meanwhile the animals had chased Jones and his men out on to the road and slammed the five-barred gate behind them. And so, almost before they knew what was happening, the Rebellion had been successfully carried through: Jones was expelled, and the Manor Farm was theirs.

For the first few minutes the animals could hardly believe in their good fortune. Their first act was to gallop in a body right round the boundaries of the farm, as though to make quite sure that no human being was hiding anywhere upon it; then they raced back to the farm buildings to wipe out the last traces of Jones's hated reign. The harness-room at the end of the stables was broken open; the bits, the nose-rings, the dog-chains, the cruel knives with which Mr. Jones had been used to castrate the pigs and lambs, were all flung down the well. The reins, the halters, the blinkers, the degrading nosebags, were thrown on to the rubbish fire which was burning in the yard. So were the whips. All the animals capered with joy when they saw the whips going up in flames. Snowball also threw on to the fire the ribbons with which the horses' manes and tails had usually been decorated on market days.

"Ribbons," he said, "should be considered as clothes, which are the mark of a human being. All animals should go naked."

When Boxer heard this he fetched the small straw hat which he wore in summer to keep the flies out of his ears, and flung it on to the fire with the rest.

In a very little while the animals had destroyed everything that reminded them of Mr. Jones. Napoleon then led them back to the store-shed and served out a double ration of corn to everybody, with two biscuits for each dog. Then they sang Beasts of England from end to end seven times running, and after that they settled down for the night and slept as they had never slept before.

But they woke at dawn as usual, and suddenly remembering the glorious thing that had happened, they all raced out into the pasture together. A little way down the pasture there was a knoll that commanded a view of most of the farm. The animals rushed to the top of it and gazed round them in the clear morning light. Yes, it was theirs—everything that they could see was theirs! In the ecstasy of that thought they gambolled round and round, they hurled themselves into the air in great leaps of excitement. They rolled in the dew, they cropped mouthfuls of the sweet summer grass, they kicked up clods of the black earth and snuffed its rich scent. Then they made a tour of inspection of the whole farm and surveyed with speechless admiration the ploughland, the hayfield, the orchard, the pool, the spinney. It was as though they had never seen these things before, and even now they could hardly believe that it was all their own.

Then they filed back to the farm buildings and halted in silence outside the door of the farmhouse. That was theirs too, but they were frightened to go inside. After a moment, however, Snowball and Napoleon butted the door open with their shoulders and the animals entered in single file, walking with the utmost care for fear of disturbing anything. They tiptoed from room to room, afraid to speak above a whisper and gazing with a kind of awe at the unbelievable luxury, at the beds with their feather mattresses, the looking-glasses, the horsehair sofa, the Brussels carpet, the lithograph of Queen Victoria over the drawing-room mantelpiece. They were lust coming down the stairs when Mollie was discovered to be missing. Going back, the others found that she had remained behind in the best bedroom. She had taken a piece of blue ribbon from Mrs. Jones's dressing-table, and was holding it against her shoulder and admiring herself in the glass in a very foolish manner. The others reproached her sharply, and they went outside. Some hams hanging in the kitchen were taken out for burial, and the barrel of beer in the scullery was stove in with a kick from Boxer's hoof, otherwise nothing in the house was touched. A unanimous resolution was passed on the spot that the farmhouse should be preserved as a museum. All were agreed that no animal must ever live there.

The animals had their breakfast, and then Snowball and Napoleon called them together again.

"Comrades," said Snowball, "it is half past six and we have a long day before us. Today we begin the hay harvest. But there is another matter that must be attended to first."

The pigs now revealed that during the past three months they had taught themselves to read and write from an old spelling book which had belonged to Mr. Jones's children and which had been thrown on the rubbish heap. Napoleon sent for pots of black and white paint and led the way down to the five-barred gate that gave on to the main road. Then Snowball (for it was Snowball who was best at writing) took a brush between the two knuckles of his trotter, painted out MANOR FARM from the top bar of the gate and in its place painted ANIMAL FARM. This was to be the name of the farm from now onwards. After this they went back to the farm buildings, where Snowball and Napoleon sent for a ladder which they caused to be set against the end wall of the big barn. They explained that by their studies of the past three months the pigs had succeeded in reducing the principles of Animalism to Seven Commandments. These Seven Commandments would now be inscribed on the wall; they would form an unalterable law by which all the animals on Animal Farm must live for ever after. With some difficulty (for it is not easy for a pig to balance himself on a ladder) Snowball climbed up and set to work, with Squealer a few rungs below him holding the paint-pot. The Commandments were written on the tarred wall in great white letters that could be read thirty yards away. They ran thus:

THE SEVEN COMMANDMENTS





1. Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy.

2. Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend.

3. No animal shall wear clothes.

4. No animal shall sleep in a bed.

5. No animal shall drink alcohol.

6. No animal shall kill any other animal.

7. All animals are equal.





It was very neatly written, and except that "friend" was written "freind" and one of the "s" was the wrong way round, the spelling was correct all the way through. Snowball read it aloud for the benefit of the others. All the animals nodded in complete agreement, and the cleverer ones at once began to learn the Commandments by heart.

"Now, comrades," cried Snowball, throwing down the paint-brush, "to the hayfield! Let us make it a point of honour to get in the harvest more quickly than Jones and his men could do."

But at this moment the three cows, who had seemed uneasy for some time past, set up a loud lowing. They had not been milked for twenty-four hours, and their udders were almost bursting. After a little thought, the pigs sent for buckets and milked the cows fairly successfully, their trotters being well adapted to this task. Soon there were five buckets of frothing creamy milk at which many of the animals looked with considerable interest.

"What is going to happen to all that milk?" said someone.

"Jones used sometimes to mix some of it in our mash," said one of the hens.

"Never mind the milk, comrades!" cried Napoleon, placing himself in front of the buckets. "That will be attended to. The harvest is more important. Comrade Snowball will lead the way. I shall follow in a few minutes. Forward, comrades! The hay is waiting."

So the animals trooped down to the hayfield to begin the harvest, and when they came back in the evening it was noticed that the milk had disappeared.





Chapter III


How they toiled and sweated to get the hay in! But their efforts were rewarded, for the harvest was an even bigger success than they had hoped.

Sometimes the work was hard; the implements had been designed for human beings and not for animals, and it was a great drawback that no animal was able to use any tool that involved standing on his hind legs. But the pigs were so clever that they could think of a way round every difficulty. As for the horses, they knew every inch of the field, and in fact understood the business of mowing and raking far better than Jones and his men had ever done. The pigs did not actually work, but directed and supervised the others. With their superior knowledge it was natural that they should assume the leadership. Boxer and Clover would harness themselves to the cutter or the horse-rake (no bits or reins were needed in these days, of course) and tramp steadily round and round the field with a pig walking behind and calling out "Gee up, comrade!" or "Whoa back, comrade!" as the case might be. And every animal down to the humblest worked at turning the hay and gathering it. Even the ducks and hens toiled to and fro all day in the sun, carrying tiny wisps of hay in their beaks. In the end they finished the harvest in two days' less time than it had usually taken Jones and his men. Moreover, it was the biggest harvest that the farm had ever seen. There was no wastage whatever; the hens and ducks with their sharp eyes had gathered up the very last stalk. And not an animal on the farm had stolen so much as a mouthful.

All through that summer the work of the farm went like clockwork. The animals were happy as they had never conceived it possible to be. Every mouthful of food was an acute positive pleasure, now that it was truly their own food, produced by themselves and for themselves, not doled out to them by a grudging master. With the worthless parasitical human beings gone, there was more for everyone to eat. There was more leisure too, inexperienced though the animals were. They met with many difficulties, for instance, later in the year, when they harvested the corn, they had to tread it out in the ancient style and blow away the chaff with their breath, since the farm possessed no threshing machine, but the pigs with their cleverness and Boxer with his tremendous muscles always pulled them through. Boxer was the admiration of everybody. He had been a hard worker even in Jones's time, but now he seemed more like three horses than one; there were days when the entire work of the farm seemed to rest on his mighty shoulders. From morning to night he was pushing and pulling, always at the spot where the work was hardest. He had made an arrangement with one of the cockerels to call him in the mornings half an hour earlier than anyone else, and would put in some volunteer labour at whatever seemed to be most needed, before the regular day's work began. His answer to every problem, every setback, was "I will work harder!"—which he had adopted as his personal motto.

But everyone worked according to his capacity. The hens and ducks, for instance, saved five bushels of corn at the harvest by gathering up the stray grains. Nobody stole, nobody grumbled over his rations, the quarrelling and biting and jealousy which had been normal features of life in the old days had almost disappeared. Nobody shirked—or almost nobody. Mollie, it was true, was not good at getting up in the mornings, and had a way of leaving work early on the ground that there was a stone in her hoof. And the behaviour of the cat was somewhat peculiar. It was soon noticed that when there was work to be done the cat could never be found. She would vanish for hours on end, and then reappear at meal-times, or in the evening after work was over, as though nothing had happened. But she always made such excellent excuses, and purred so affectionately, that it was impossible not to believe in her good intentions. Old Benjamin, the donkey, seemed quite unchanged since the Rebellion. He did his work in the same slow obstinate way as he had done it in Jones's time, never shirking and never volunteering for extra work either. About the Rebellion and its results he would express no opinion. When asked whether he was not happier now that Jones was gone, he would say only "Donkeys live a long time. None of you has ever seen a dead donkey," and the others had to be content with this cryptic answer.

On Sundays there was no work. Breakfast was an hour later than usual, and after breakfast there was a ceremony which was observed every week without fail. First came the hoisting of the flag, Snowball had found in the harness-room an old green tablecloth of Mrs. Jones's and had painted on it a hoof and a horn in white. This was run up the flagstaff in the farmhouse garden every Sunday morning. The flag was green, Snowball explained, to represent the green fields of England, while the hoof and horn signified the future Republic of the Animals which would arise when the human race had been finally overthrown. After the hoisting of the flag all the animals trooped into the big barn for a general assembly which was known as the Meeting. Here the work of the coming week was planned out and resolutions were put forward and debated. It was always the pigs who put forward the resolutions. The other animals understood how to vote, but could never think of any resolutions of their own. Snowball and Napoleon were by far the most active in the debates. But it was noticed that these two were never in agreement: whatever suggestion either of them made, the other could be counted on to oppose it. Even when it was resolved—a thing no one could object to in itself—to set aside the small paddock behind the orchard as a home of rest for animals who were past work, there was a stormy debate over the correct retiring age for each class of animal. The Meeting always ended with the singing of Beasts of England, and the afternoon was given up to recreation.

The pigs had set aside the harness-room as a headquarters for themselves. Here, in the evenings, they studied blacksmithing, carpentering, and other necessary arts from books which they had brought out of the farmhouse. Snowball also busied himself with organising the other animals into what he called Animal Committees. He was indefatigable at this. He formed the Egg Production Committee for the hens, the Clean Tails League for the cows, the Wild Comrades' Re-education Committee (the object of this was to tame the rats and rabbits), the Whiter Wool Movement for the sheep, and various others, besides instituting classes in reading and writing. On the whole, these projects were a failure. The attempt to tame the wild creatures, for instance, broke down almost immediately. They continued to behave very much as before, and when treated with generosity, simply took advantage of it. The cat joined the Re-education Committee and was very active in it for some days. She was seen one day sitting on a roof and talking to some sparrows who were just out of her reach. She was telling them that all animals were now comrades and that any sparrow who chose could come and perch on her paw; but the sparrows kept their distance.

The reading and writing classes, however, were a great success. By the autumn almost every animal on the farm was literate in some degree.

As for the pigs, they could already read and write perfectly. The dogs learned to read fairly well, but were not interested in reading anything except the Seven Commandments. Muriel, the goat, could read somewhat better than the dogs, and sometimes used to read to the others in the evenings from scraps of newspaper which she found on the rubbish heap. Benjamin could read as well as any pig, but never exercised his faculty. So far as he knew, he said, there was nothing worth reading. Clover learnt the whole alphabet, but could not put words together. Boxer could not get beyond the letter D. He would trace out A, B, C, D, in the dust with his great hoof, and then would stand staring at the letters with his ears back, sometimes shaking his forelock, trying with all his might to remember what came next and never succeeding. On several occasions, indeed, he did learn E, F, G, H, but by the time he knew them, it was always discovered that he had forgotten A, B, C, and D. Finally he decided to be content with the first four letters, and used to write them out once or twice every day to refresh his memory. Mollie refused to learn any but the six letters which spelt her own name. She would form these very neatly out of pieces of twig, and would then decorate them with a flower or two and walk round them admiring them.

None of the other animals on the farm could get further than the letter A. It was also found that the stupider animals, such as the sheep, hens, and ducks, were unable to learn the Seven Commandments by heart. After much thought Snowball declared that the Seven Commandments could in effect be reduced to a single maxim, namely: "Four legs good, two legs bad." This, he said, contained the essential principle of Animalism. Whoever had thoroughly grasped it would be safe from human influences. The birds at first objected, since it seemed to them that they also had two legs, but Snowball proved to them that this was not so.

"A bird's wing, comrades," he said, "is an organ of propulsion and not of manipulation. It should therefore be regarded as a leg. The distinguishing mark of man is the hand, the instrument with which he does all his mischief."

The birds did not understand Snowball's long words, but they accepted his explanation, and all the humbler animals set to work to learn the new maxim by heart. FOUR LEGS GOOD, TWO LEGS BAD, was inscribed on the end wall of the barn, above the Seven Commandments and in bigger letters When they had once got it by heart, the sheep developed a great liking for this maxim, and often as they lay in the field they would all start bleating "Four legs good, two legs bad! Four legs good, two legs bad!" and keep it up for hours on end, never growing tired of it.

Napoleon took no interest in Snowball's committees. He said that the education of the young was more important than anything that could be done for those who were already grown up. It happened that Jessie and Bluebell had both whelped soon after the hay harvest, giving birth between them to nine sturdy puppies. As soon as they were weaned, Napoleon took them away from their mothers, saying that he would make himself responsible for their education. He took them up into a loft which could only be reached by a ladder from the harness-room, and there kept them in such seclusion that the rest of the farm soon forgot their existence.

The mystery of where the milk went to was soon cleared up. It was mixed every day into the pigs' mash. The early apples were now ripening, and the grass of the orchard was littered with windfalls. The animals had assumed as a matter of course that these would be shared out equally; one day, however, the order went forth that all the windfalls were to be collected and brought to the harness-room for the use of the pigs. At this some of the other animals murmured, but it was no use. All the pigs were in full agreement on this point, even Snowball and Napoleon. Squealer was sent to make the necessary explanations to the others.

"Comrades!" he cried. "You do not imagine, I hope, that we pigs are doing this in a spirit of selfishness and privilege? Many of us actually dislike milk and apples. I dislike them myself. Our sole object in taking these things is to preserve our health. Milk and apples (this has been proved by Science, comrades) contain substances absolutely necessary to the well-being of a pig. We pigs are brainworkers. The whole management and organisation of this farm depend on us. Day and night we are watching over your welfare. It is for your sake that we drink that milk and eat those apples. Do you know what would happen if we pigs failed in our duty? Jones would come back! Yes, Jones would come back! Surely, comrades," cried Squealer almost pleadingly, skipping from side to side and whisking his tail, "surely there is no one among you who wants to see Jones come back?"

Now if there was one thing that the animals were completely certain of, it was that they did not want Jones back. When it was put to them in this light, they had no more to say. The importance of keeping the pigs in good health was all too obvious. So it was agreed without further argument that the milk and the windfall apples (and also the main crop of apples when they ripened) should be reserved for the pigs alone.





Chapter IV


By the late summer the news of what had happened on Animal Farm had spread across half the county. Every day Snowball and Napoleon sent out flights of pigeons whose instructions were to mingle with the animals on neighbouring farms, tell them the story of the Rebellion, and teach them the tune of Beasts of England.

Most of this time Mr. Jones had spent sitting in the taproom of the Red Lion at Willingdon, complaining to anyone who would listen of the monstrous injustice he had suffered in being turned out of his property by a pack of good-for-nothing animals. The other farmers sympathised in principle, but they did not at first give him much help. At heart, each of them was secretly wondering whether he could not somehow turn Jones's misfortune to his own advantage. It was lucky that the owners of the two farms which adjoined Animal Farm were on permanently bad terms. One of them, which was named Foxwood, was a large, neglected, old-fashioned farm, much overgrown by woodland, with all its pastures worn out and its hedges in a disgraceful condition. Its owner, Mr. Pilkington, was an easy-going gentleman farmer who spent most of his time in fishing or hunting according to the season. The other farm, which was called Pinchfield, was smaller and better kept. Its owner was a Mr. Frederick, a tough, shrewd man, perpetually involved in lawsuits and with a name for driving hard bargains. These two disliked each other so much that it was difficult for them to come to any agreement, even in defence of their own interests.

Nevertheless, they were both thoroughly frightened by the rebellion on Animal Farm, and very anxious to prevent their own animals from learning too much about it. At first they pretended to laugh to scorn the idea of animals managing a farm for themselves. The whole thing would be over in a fortnight, they said. They put it about that the animals on the Manor Farm (they insisted on calling it the Manor Farm; they would not tolerate the name "Animal Farm") were perpetually fighting among themselves and were also rapidly starving to death. When time passed and the animals had evidently not starved to death, Frederick and Pilkington changed their tune and began to talk of the terrible wickedness that now flourished on Animal Farm. It was given out that the animals there practised cannibalism, tortured one another with red-hot horseshoes, and had their females in common. This was what came of rebelling against the laws of Nature, Frederick and Pilkington said.

However, these stories were never fully believed. Rumours of a wonderful farm, where the human beings had been turned out and the animals managed their own affairs, continued to circulate in vague and distorted forms, and throughout that year a wave of rebelliousness ran through the countryside. Bulls which had always been tractable suddenly turned savage, sheep broke down hedges and devoured the clover, cows kicked the pail over, hunters refused their fences and shot their riders on to the other side. Above all, the tune and even the words of Beasts of England were known everywhere. It had spread with astonishing speed. The human beings could not contain their rage when they heard this song, though they pretended to think it merely ridiculous. They could not understand, they said, how even animals could bring themselves to sing such contemptible rubbish. Any animal caught singing it was given a flogging on the spot. And yet the song was irrepressible. The blackbirds whistled it in the hedges, the pigeons cooed it in the elms, it got into the din of the smithies and the tune of the church bells. And when the human beings listened to it, they secretly trembled, hearing in it a prophecy of their future doom.

Early in October, when the corn was cut and stacked and some of it was already threshed, a flight of pigeons came whirling through the air and alighted in the yard of Animal Farm in the wildest excitement. Jones and all his men, with half a dozen others from Foxwood and Pinchfield, had entered the five-barred gate and were coming up the cart-track that led to the farm. They were all carrying sticks, except Jones, who was marching ahead with a gun in his hands. Obviously they were going to attempt the recapture of the farm.

This had long been expected, and all preparations had been made. Snowball, who had studied an old book of Julius Caesar's campaigns which he had found in the farmhouse, was in charge of the defensive operations. He gave his orders quickly, and in a couple of minutes every animal was at his post.

As the human beings approached the farm buildings, Snowball launched his first attack. All the pigeons, to the number of thirty-five, flew to and fro over the men's heads and muted upon them from mid-air; and while the men were dealing with this, the geese, who had been hiding behind the hedge, rushed out and pecked viciously at the calves of their legs. However, this was only a light skirmishing manoeuvre, intended to create a little disorder, and the men easily drove the geese off with their sticks. Snowball now launched his second line of attack. Muriel, Benjamin, and all the sheep, with Snowball at the head of them, rushed forward and prodded and butted the men from every side, while Benjamin turned around and lashed at them with his small hoofs. But once again the men, with their sticks and their hobnailed boots, were too strong for them; and suddenly, at a squeal from Snowball, which was the signal for retreat, all the animals turned and fled through the gateway into the yard.

The men gave a shout of triumph. They saw, as they imagined, their enemies in flight, and they rushed after them in disorder. This was just what Snowball had intended. As soon as they were well inside the yard, the three horses, the three cows, and the rest of the pigs, who had been lying in ambush in the cowshed, suddenly emerged in their rear, cutting them off. Snowball now gave the signal for the charge. He himself dashed straight for Jones. Jones saw him coming, raised his gun and fired. The pellets scored bloody streaks along Snowball's back, and a sheep dropped dead. Without halting for an instant, Snowball flung his fifteen stone against Jones's legs. Jones was hurled into a pile of dung and his gun flew out of his hands. But the most terrifying spectacle of all was Boxer, rearing up on his hind legs and striking out with his great iron-shod hoofs like a stallion. His very first blow took a stable-lad from Foxwood on the skull and stretched him lifeless in the mud. At the sight, several men dropped their sticks and tried to run. Panic overtook them, and the next moment all the animals together were chasing them round and round the yard. They were gored, kicked, bitten, trampled on. There was not an animal on the farm that did not take vengeance on them after his own fashion. Even the cat suddenly leapt off a roof onto a cowman's shoulders and sank her claws in his neck, at which he yelled horribly. At a moment when the opening was clear, the men were glad enough to rush out of the yard and make a bolt for the main road. And so within five minutes of their invasion they were in ignominious retreat by the same way as they had come, with a flock of geese hissing after them and pecking at their calves all the way.

All the men were gone except one. Back in the yard Boxer was pawing with his hoof at the stable-lad who lay face down in the mud, trying to turn him over. The boy did not stir.

"He is dead," said Boxer sorrowfully. "I had no intention of doing that. I forgot that I was wearing iron shoes. Who will believe that I did not do this on purpose?"

"No sentimentality, comrade!" cried Snowball from whose wounds the blood was still dripping. "War is war. The only good human being is a dead one."

"I have no wish to take life, not even human life," repeated Boxer, and his eyes were full of tears.

"Where is Mollie?" exclaimed somebody.

Mollie in fact was missing. For a moment there was great alarm; it was feared that the men might have harmed her in some way, or even carried her off with them. In the end, however, she was found hiding in her stall with her head buried among the hay in the manger. She had taken to flight as soon as the gun went off. And when the others came back from looking for her, it was to find that the stable-lad, who in fact was only stunned, had already recovered and made off.

The animals had now reassembled in the wildest excitement, each recounting his own exploits in the battle at the top of his voice. An impromptu celebration of the victory was held immediately. The flag was run up and Beasts of England was sung a number of times, then the sheep who had been killed was given a solemn funeral, a hawthorn bush being planted on her grave. At the graveside Snowball made a little speech, emphasising the need for all animals to be ready to die for Animal Farm if need be.

The animals decided unanimously to create a military decoration, "Animal Hero, First Class," which was conferred there and then on Snowball and Boxer. It consisted of a brass medal (they were really some old horse-brasses which had been found in the harness-room), to be worn on Sundays and holidays. There was also "Animal Hero, Second Class," which was conferred posthumously on the dead sheep.

There was much discussion as to what the battle should be called. In the end, it was named the Battle of the Cowshed, since that was where the ambush had been sprung. Mr. Jones's gun had been found lying in the mud, and it was known that there was a supply of cartridges in the farmhouse. It was decided to set the gun up at the foot of the flagstaff, like a piece of artillery, and to fire it twice a year—once on October the twelfth, the anniversary of the Battle of the Cowshed, and once on Midsummer Day, the anniversary of the Rebellion.





Chapter V


As winter drew on, Mollie became more and more troublesome. She was late for work every morning and excused herself by saying that she had overslept, and she complained of mysterious pains, although her appetite was excellent. On every kind of pretext she would run away from work and go to the drinking pool, where she would stand foolishly gazing at her own reflection in the water. But there were also rumours of something more serious. One day, as Mollie strolled blithely into the yard, flirting her long tail and chewing at a stalk of hay, Clover took her aside.

"Mollie," she said, "I have something very serious to say to you. This morning I saw you looking over the hedge that divides Animal Farm from Foxwood. One of Mr. Pilkington's men was standing on the other side of the hedge. And I was a long way away, but I am almost certain I saw this he was talking to you and you were allowing him to stroke your nose. What does that mean, Mollie?"

"He didn't! I wasn't! It isn't true!" cried Mollie, beginning to prance about and paw the ground.

"Mollie! Look me in the face. Do you give me your word of honour that that man was not stroking your nose?"

"It isn't true!" repeated Mollie, but she could not look Clover in the face, and the next moment she took to her heels and galloped away into the field.

A thought struck Clover. Without saying anything to the others, she went to Mollie's stall and turned over the straw with her hoof. Hidden under the straw was a little pile of lump sugar and several bunches of ribbon of different colours.

Three days later Mollie disappeared. For some weeks nothing was known of her whereabouts, then the pigeons reported that they had seen her on the other side of Willingdon. She was between the shafts of a smart dogcart painted red and black, which was standing outside a public-house. A fat red-faced man in check breeches and gaiters, who looked like a publican, was stroking her nose and feeding her with sugar. Her coat was newly clipped and she wore a scarlet ribbon round her forelock. She appeared to be enjoying herself, so the pigeons said. None of the animals ever mentioned Mollie again.

In January there came bitterly hard weather. The earth was like iron, and nothing could be done in the fields. Many meetings were held in the big barn, and the pigs occupied themselves with planning out the work of the coming season. It had come to be accepted that the pigs, who were manifestly cleverer than the other animals, should decide all questions of farm policy, though their decisions had to be ratified by a majority vote. This arrangement would have worked well enough if it had not been for the disputes between Snowball and Napoleon. These two disagreed at every point where disagreement was possible. If one of them suggested sowing a bigger acreage with barley, the other was certain to demand a bigger acreage of oats, and if one of them said that such and such a field was just right for cabbages, the other would declare that it was useless for anything except roots. Each had his own following, and there were some violent debates. At the Meetings Snowball often won over the majority by his brilliant speeches, but Napoleon was better at canvassing support for himself in between times. He was especially successful with the sheep. Of late the sheep had taken to bleating "Four legs good, two legs bad" both in and out of season, and they often interrupted the Meeting with this. It was noticed that they were especially liable to break into "Four legs good, two legs bad" at crucial moments in Snowball's speeches. Snowball had made a close study of some back numbers of the Farmer and Stockbreeder which he had found in the farmhouse, and was full of plans for innovations and improvements. He talked learnedly about field drains, silage, and basic slag, and had worked out a complicated scheme for all the animals to drop their dung directly in the fields, at a different spot every day, to save the labour of cartage. Napoleon produced no schemes of his own, but said quietly that Snowball's would come to nothing, and seemed to be biding his time. But of all their controversies, none was so bitter as the one that took place over the windmill.

In the long pasture, not far from the farm buildings, there was a small knoll which was the highest point on the farm. After surveying the ground, Snowball declared that this was just the place for a windmill, which could be made to operate a dynamo and supply the farm with electrical power. This would light the stalls and warm them in winter, and would also run a circular saw, a chaff-cutter, a mangel-slicer, and an electric milking machine. The animals had never heard of anything of this kind before (for the farm was an old-fashioned one and had only the most primitive machinery), and they listened in astonishment while Snowball conjured up pictures of fantastic machines which would do their work for them while they grazed at their ease in the fields or improved their minds with reading and conversation.

Within a few weeks Snowball's plans for the windmill were fully worked out. The mechanical details came mostly from three books which had belonged to Mr. Jones—One Thousand Useful Things to Do About the House, Every Man His Own Bricklayer, and Electricity for Beginners. Snowball used as his study a shed which had once been used for incubators and had a smooth wooden floor, suitable for drawing on. He was closeted there for hours at a time. With his books held open by a stone, and with a piece of chalk gripped between the knuckles of his trotter, he would move rapidly to and fro, drawing in line after line and uttering little whimpers of excitement. Gradually the plans grew into a complicated mass of cranks and cog-wheels, covering more than half the floor, which the other animals found completely unintelligible but very impressive. All of them came to look at Snowball's drawings at least once a day. Even the hens and ducks came, and were at pains not to tread on the chalk marks. Only Napoleon held aloof. He had declared himself against the windmill from the start. One day, however, he arrived unexpectedly to examine the plans. He walked heavily round the shed, looked closely at every detail of the plans and snuffed at them once or twice, then stood for a little while contemplating them out of the corner of his eye; then suddenly he lifted his leg, urinated over the plans, and walked out without uttering a word.

The whole farm was deeply divided on the subject of the windmill. Snowball did not deny that to build it would be a difficult business. Stone would have to be carried and built up into walls, then the sails would have to be made and after that there would be need for dynamos and cables. (How these were to be procured, Snowball did not say.) But he maintained that it could all be done in a year. And thereafter, he declared, so much labour would be saved that the animals would only need to work three days a week. Napoleon, on the other hand, argued that the great need of the moment was to increase food production, and that if they wasted time on the windmill they would all starve to death. The animals formed themselves into two factions under the slogan, "Vote for Snowball and the three-day week" and "Vote for Napoleon and the full manger." Benjamin was the only animal who did not side with either faction. He refused to believe either that food would become more plentiful or that the windmill would save work. Windmill or no windmill, he said, life would go on as it had always gone on—that is, badly.

Apart from the disputes over the windmill, there was the question of the defence of the farm. It was fully realised that though the human beings had been defeated in the Battle of the Cowshed they might make another and more determined attempt to recapture the farm and reinstate Mr. Jones. They had all the more reason for doing so because the news of their defeat had spread across the countryside and made the animals on the neighbouring farms more restive than ever. As usual, Snowball and Napoleon were in disagreement. According to Napoleon, what the animals must do was to procure firearms and train themselves in the use of them. According to Snowball, they must send out more and more pigeons and stir up rebellion among the animals on the other farms. The one argued that if they could not defend themselves they were bound to be conquered, the other argued that if rebellions happened everywhere they would have no need to defend themselves. The animals listened first to Napoleon, then to Snowball, and could not make up their minds which was right; indeed, they always found themselves in agreement with the one who was speaking at the moment.

At last the day came when Snowball's plans were completed. At the Meeting on the following Sunday the question of whether or not to begin work on the windmill was to be put to the vote. When the animals had assembled in the big barn, Snowball stood up and, though occasionally interrupted by bleating from the sheep, set forth his reasons for advocating the building of the windmill. Then Napoleon stood up to reply. He said very quietly that the windmill was nonsense and that he advised nobody to vote for it, and promptly sat down again; he had spoken for barely thirty seconds, and seemed almost indifferent as to the effect he produced. At this Snowball sprang to his feet, and shouting down the sheep, who had begun bleating again, broke into a passionate appeal in favour of the windmill. Until now the animals had been about equally divided in their sympathies, but in a moment Snowball's eloquence had carried them away. In glowing sentences he painted a picture of Animal Farm as it might be when sordid labour was lifted from the animals' backs. His imagination had now run far beyond chaff-cutters and turnip-slicers. Electricity, he said, could operate threshing machines, ploughs, harrows, rollers, and reapers and binders, besides supplying every stall with its own electric light, hot and cold water, and an electric heater. By the time he had finished speaking, there was no doubt as to which way the vote would go. But just at this moment Napoleon stood up and, casting a peculiar sidelong look at Snowball, uttered a high-pitched whimper of a kind no one had ever heard him utter before.

At this there was a terrible baying sound outside, and nine enormous dogs wearing brass-studded collars came bounding into the barn. They dashed straight for Snowball, who only sprang from his place just in time to escape their snapping jaws. In a moment he was out of the door and they were after him. Too amazed and frightened to speak, all the animals crowded through the door to watch the chase. Snowball was racing across the long pasture that led to the road. He was running as only a pig can run, but the dogs were close on his heels. Suddenly he slipped and it seemed certain that they had him. Then he was up again, running faster than ever, then the dogs were gaining on him again. One of them all but closed his jaws on Snowball's tail, but Snowball whisked it free just in time. Then he put on an extra spurt and, with a few inches to spare, slipped through a hole in the hedge and was seen no more.

Silent and terrified, the animals crept back into the barn. In a moment the dogs came bounding back. At first no one had been able to imagine where these creatures came from, but the problem was soon solved: they were the puppies whom Napoleon had taken away from their mothers and reared privately. Though not yet full-grown, they were huge dogs, and as fierce-looking as wolves. They kept close to Napoleon. It was noticed that they wagged their tails to him in the same way as the other dogs had been used to do to Mr. Jones.

Napoleon, with the dogs following him, now mounted on to the raised portion of the floor where Major had previously stood to deliver his speech. He announced that from now on the Sunday morning Meetings would come to an end. They were unnecessary, he said, and wasted time. In future all questions relating to the working of the farm would be settled by a special committee of pigs, presided over by himself. These would meet in private and afterwards communicate their decisions to the others. The animals would still assemble on Sunday mornings to salute the flag, sing Beasts of England, and receive their orders for the week; but there would be no more debates.

In spite of the shock that Snowball's expulsion had given them, the animals were dismayed by this announcement. Several of them would have protested if they could have found the right arguments. Even Boxer was vaguely troubled. He set his ears back, shook his forelock several times, and tried hard to marshal his thoughts; but in the end he could not think of anything to say. Some of the pigs themselves, however, were more articulate. Four young porkers in the front row uttered shrill squeals of disapproval, and all four of them sprang to their feet and began speaking at once. But suddenly the dogs sitting round Napoleon let out deep, menacing growls, and the pigs fell silent and sat down again. Then the sheep broke out into a tremendous bleating of "Four legs good, two legs bad!" which went on for nearly a quarter of an hour and put an end to any chance of discussion.

Afterwards Squealer was sent round the farm to explain the new arrangement to the others.

"Comrades," he said, "I trust that every animal here appreciates the sacrifice that Comrade Napoleon has made in taking this extra labour upon himself. Do not imagine, comrades, that leadership is a pleasure! On the contrary, it is a deep and heavy responsibility. No one believes more firmly than Comrade Napoleon that all animals are equal. He would be only too happy to let you make your decisions for yourselves. But sometimes you might make the wrong decisions, comrades, and then where should we be? Suppose you had decided to follow Snowball, with his moonshine of windmills—Snowball, who, as we now know, was no better than a criminal?"

"He fought bravely at the Battle of the Cowshed," said somebody.

"Bravery is not enough," said Squealer. "Loyalty and obedience are more important. And as to the Battle of the Cowshed, I believe the time will come when we shall find that Snowball's part in it was much exaggerated. Discipline, comrades, iron discipline! That is the watchword for today. One false step, and our enemies would be upon us. Surely, comrades, you do not want Jones back?"

Once again this argument was unanswerable. Certainly the animals did not want Jones back; if the holding of debates on Sunday mornings was liable to bring him back, then the debates must stop. Boxer, who had now had time to think things over, voiced the general feeling by saying: "If Comrade Napoleon says it, it must be right." And from then on he adopted the maxim, "Napoleon is always right," in addition to his private motto of "I will work harder."

By this time the weather had broken and the spring ploughing had begun. The shed where Snowball had drawn his plans of the windmill had been shut up and it was assumed that the plans had been rubbed off the floor. Every Sunday morning at ten o'clock the animals assembled in the big barn to receive their orders for the week. The skull of old Major, now clean of flesh, had been disinterred from the orchard and set up on a stump at the foot of the flagstaff, beside the gun. After the hoisting of the flag, the animals were required to file past the skull in a reverent manner before entering the barn. Nowadays they did not sit all together as they had done in the past. Napoleon, with Squealer and another pig named Minimus, who had a remarkable gift for composing songs and poems, sat on the front of the raised platform, with the nine young dogs forming a semicircle round them, and the other pigs sitting behind. The rest of the animals sat facing them in the main body of the barn. Napoleon read out the orders for the week in a gruff soldierly style, and after a single singing of Beasts of England, all the animals dispersed.

On the third Sunday after Snowball's expulsion, the animals were somewhat surprised to hear Napoleon announce that the windmill was to be built after all. He did not give any reason for having changed his mind, but merely warned the animals that this extra task would mean very hard work, it might even be necessary to reduce their rations. The plans, however, had all been prepared, down to the last detail. A special committee of pigs had been at work upon them for the past three weeks. The building of the windmill, with various other improvements, was expected to take two years.

That evening Squealer explained privately to the other animals that Napoleon had never in reality been opposed to the windmill. On the contrary, it was he who had advocated it in the beginning, and the plan which Snowball had drawn on the floor of the incubator shed had actually been stolen from among Napoleon's papers. The windmill was, in fact, Napoleon's own creation. Why, then, asked somebody, had he spoken so strongly against it? Here Squealer looked very sly. That, he said, was Comrade Napoleon's cunning. He had seemed to oppose the windmill, simply as a manoeuvre to get rid of Snowball, who was a dangerous character and a bad influence. Now that Snowball was out of the way, the plan could go forward without his interference. This, said Squealer, was something called tactics. He repeated a number of times, "Tactics, comrades, tactics!" skipping round and whisking his tail with a merry laugh. The animals were not certain what the word meant, but Squealer spoke so persuasively, and the three dogs who happened to be with him growled so threateningly, that they accepted his explanation without further questions.





Chapter VI


All that year the animals worked like slaves. But they were happy in their work; they grudged no effort or sacrifice, well aware that everything that they did was for the benefit of themselves and those of their kind who would come after them, and not for a pack of idle, thieving human beings.

Throughout the spring and summer they worked a sixty-hour week, and in August Napoleon announced that there would be work on Sunday afternoons as well. This work was strictly voluntary, but any animal who absented himself from it would have his rations reduced by half. Even so, it was found necessary to leave certain tasks undone. The harvest was a little less successful than in the previous year, and two fields which should have been sown with roots in the early summer were not sown because the ploughing had not been completed early enough. It was possible to foresee that the coming winter would be a hard one.

The windmill presented unexpected difficulties. There was a good quarry of limestone on the farm, and plenty of sand and cement had been found in one of the outhouses, so that all the materials for building were at hand. But the problem the animals could not at first solve was how to break up the stone into pieces of suitable size. There seemed no way of doing this except with picks and crowbars, which no animal could use, because no animal could stand on his hind legs. Only after weeks of vain effort did the right idea occur to somebody namely to utilise the force of gravity. Huge boulders, far too big to be used as they were, were lying all over the bed of the quarry. The animals lashed ropes round these, and then all together, cows, horses, sheep, any animal that could lay hold of the rope—even the pigs sometimes joined in at critical moments—they dragged them with desperate slowness up the slope to the top of the quarry, where they were toppled over the edge, to shatter to pieces below. Transporting the stone when it was once broken was comparatively simple. The horses carried it off in cart-loads, the sheep dragged single blocks, even Muriel and Benjamin yoked themselves into an old governess-cart and did their share. By late summer a sufficient store of stone had accumulated, and then the building began, under the superintendence of the pigs.

But it was a slow, laborious process. Frequently it took a whole day of exhausting effort to drag a single boulder to the top of the quarry, and sometimes when it was pushed over the edge it failed to break. Nothing could have been achieved without Boxer, whose strength seemed equal to that of all the rest of the animals put together. When the boulder began to slip and the animals cried out in despair at finding themselves dragged down the hill, it was always Boxer who strained himself against the rope and brought the boulder to a stop. To see him toiling up the slope inch by inch, his breath coming fast, the tips of his hoofs clawing at the ground, and his great sides matted with sweat, filled everyone with admiration. Clover warned him sometimes to be careful not to overstrain himself, but Boxer would never listen to her. His two slogans, "I will work harder" and "Napoleon is always right," seemed to him a sufficient answer to all problems. He had made arrangements with the cockerel to call him three-quarters of an hour earlier in the mornings instead of half an hour. And in his spare moments, of which there were not many nowadays, he would go alone to the quarry, collect a load of broken stone, and drag it down to the site of the windmill unassisted.

The animals were not badly off throughout that summer, in spite of the hardness of their work. If they had no more food than they had had in Jones's day, at least they did not have less. The advantage of only having to feed themselves, and not having to support five extravagant human beings as well, was so great that it would have taken a lot of failures to outweigh it. And in many ways the animal method of doing things was more efficient and saved labour. Such jobs as weeding, for instance, could be done with a thoroughness impossible to human beings. And again, since no animal now stole, it was unnecessary to fence off pasture from arable land, which saved a lot of labour on the upkeep of hedges and gates. Nevertheless, as the summer wore on, various unforeseen shortages began to make them selves felt. There was need of paraffin oil, nails, string, dog biscuits, and iron for the horses' shoes, none of which could be produced on the farm. Later there would also be need for seeds and artificial manures, besides various tools and, finally, the machinery for the windmill. How these were to be procured, no one was able to imagine.

One Sunday morning, when the animals assembled to receive their orders, Napoleon announced that he had decided upon a new policy. From now onwards Animal Farm would engage in trade with the neighbouring farms: not, of course, for any commercial purpose, but simply in order to obtain certain materials which were urgently necessary. The needs of the windmill must override everything else, he said. He was therefore making arrangements to sell a stack of hay and part of the current year's wheat crop, and later on, if more money were needed, it would have to be made up by the sale of eggs, for which there was always a market in Willingdon. The hens, said Napoleon, should welcome this sacrifice as their own special contribution towards the building of the windmill.

Once again the animals were conscious of a vague uneasiness. Never to have any dealings with human beings, never to engage in trade, never to make use of money—had not these been among the earliest resolutions passed at that first triumphant Meeting after Jones was expelled? All the animals remembered passing such resolutions: or at least they thought that they remembered it. The four young pigs who had protested when Napoleon abolished the Meetings raised their voices timidly, but they were promptly silenced by a tremendous growling from the dogs. Then, as usual, the sheep broke into "Four legs good, two legs bad!" and the momentary awkwardness was smoothed over. Finally Napoleon raised his trotter for silence and announced that he had already made all the arrangements. There would be no need for any of the animals to come in contact with human beings, which would clearly be most undesirable. He intended to take the whole burden upon his own shoulders. A Mr. Whymper, a solicitor living in Willingdon, had agreed to act as intermediary between Animal Farm and the outside world, and would visit the farm every Monday morning to receive his instructions. Napoleon ended his speech with his usual cry of "Long live Animal Farm!" and after the singing of Beasts of England the animals were dismissed.

Afterwards Squealer made a round of the farm and set the animals' minds at rest. He assured them that the resolution against engaging in trade and using money had never been passed, or even suggested. It was pure imagination, probably traceable in the beginning to lies circulated by Snowball. A few animals still felt faintly doubtful, but Squealer asked them shrewdly, "Are you certain that this is not something that you have dreamed, comrades? Have you any record of such a resolution? Is it written down anywhere?" And since it was certainly true that nothing of the kind existed in writing, the animals were satisfied that they had been mistaken.

Every Monday Mr. Whymper visited the farm as had been arranged. He was a sly-looking little man with side whiskers, a solicitor in a very small way of business, but sharp enough to have realised earlier than anyone else that Animal Farm would need a broker and that the commissions would be worth having. The animals watched his coming and going with a kind of dread, and avoided him as much as possible. Nevertheless, the sight of Napoleon, on all fours, delivering orders to Whymper, who stood on two legs, roused their pride and partly reconciled them to the new arrangement. Their relations with the human race were now not quite the same as they had been before. The human beings did not hate Animal Farm any less now that it was prospering; indeed, they hated it more than ever. Every human being held it as an article of faith that the farm would go bankrupt sooner or later, and, above all, that the windmill would be a failure. They would meet in the public-houses and prove to one another by means of diagrams that the windmill was bound to fall down, or that if it did stand up, then that it would never work. And yet, against their will, they had developed a certain respect for the efficiency with which the animals were managing their own affairs. One symptom of this was that they had begun to call Animal Farm by its proper name and ceased to pretend that it was called the Manor Farm. They had also dropped their championship of Jones, who had given up hope of getting his farm back and gone to live in another part of the county. Except through Whymper, there was as yet no contact between Animal Farm and the outside world, but there were constant rumours that Napoleon was about to enter into a definite business agreement either with Mr. Pilkington of Foxwood or with Mr. Frederick of Pinchfield—but never, it was noticed, with both simultaneously.

It was about this time that the pigs suddenly moved into the farmhouse and took up their residence there. Again the animals seemed to remember that a resolution against this had been passed in the early days, and again Squealer was able to convince them that this was not the case. It was absolutely necessary, he said, that the pigs, who were the brains of the farm, should have a quiet place to work in. It was also more suited to the dignity of the Leader (for of late he had taken to speaking of Napoleon under the title of "Leader") to live in a house than in a mere sty. Nevertheless, some of the animals were disturbed when they heard that the pigs not only took their meals in the kitchen and used the drawing-room as a recreation room, but also slept in the beds. Boxer passed it off as usual with "Napoleon is always right!", but Clover, who thought she remembered a definite ruling against beds, went to the end of the barn and tried to puzzle out the Seven Commandments which were inscribed there. Finding herself unable to read more than individual letters, she fetched Muriel.

"Muriel," she said, "read me the Fourth Commandment. Does it not say something about never sleeping in a bed?"

With some difficulty Muriel spelt it out.

"It says, 'No animal shall sleep in a bed with sheets,'" she announced finally.

Curiously enough, Clover had not remembered that the Fourth Commandment mentioned sheets; but as it was there on the wall, it must have done so. And Squealer, who happened to be passing at this moment, attended by two or three dogs, was able to put the whole matter in its proper perspective.

"You have heard then, comrades," he said, "that we pigs now sleep in the beds of the farmhouse? And why not? You did not suppose, surely, that there was ever a ruling against beds? A bed merely means a place to sleep in. A pile of straw in a stall is a bed, properly regarded. The rule was against sheets, which are a human invention. We have removed the sheets from the farmhouse beds, and sleep between blankets. And very comfortable beds they are too! But not more comfortable than we need, I can tell you, comrades, with all the brainwork we have to do nowadays. You would not rob us of our repose, would you, comrades? You would not have us too tired to carry out our duties? Surely none of you wishes to see Jones back?"

The animals reassured him on this point immediately, and no more was said about the pigs sleeping in the farmhouse beds. And when, some days afterwards, it was announced that from now on the pigs would get up an hour later in the mornings than the other animals, no complaint was made about that either.

By the autumn the animals were tired but happy. They had had a hard year, and after the sale of part of the hay and corn, the stores of food for the winter were none too plentiful, but the windmill compensated for everything. It was almost half built now. After the harvest there was a stretch of clear dry weather, and the animals toiled harder than ever, thinking it well worth while to plod to and fro all day with blocks of stone if by doing so they could raise the walls another foot. Boxer would even come out at nights and work for an hour or two on his own by the light of the harvest moon. In their spare moments the animals would walk round and round the half-finished mill, admiring the strength and perpendicularity of its walls and marvelling that they should ever have been able to build anything so imposing. Only old Benjamin refused to grow enthusiastic about the windmill, though, as usual, he would utter nothing beyond the cryptic remark that donkeys live a long time.

November came, with raging south-west winds. Building had to stop because it was now too wet to mix the cement. Finally there came a night when the gale was so violent that the farm buildings rocked on their foundations and several tiles were blown off the roof of the barn. The hens woke up squawking with terror because they had all dreamed simultaneously of hearing a gun go off in the distance. In the morning the animals came out of their stalls to find that the flagstaff had been blown down and an elm tree at the foot of the orchard had been plucked up like a radish. They had just noticed this when a cry of despair broke from every animal's throat. A terrible sight had met their eyes. The windmill was in ruins.

With one accord they dashed down to the spot. Napoleon, who seldom moved out of a walk, raced ahead of them all. Yes, there it lay, the fruit of all their struggles, levelled to its foundations, the stones they had broken and carried so laboriously scattered all around. Unable at first to speak, they stood gazing mournfully at the litter of fallen stone. Napoleon paced to and fro in silence, occasionally snuffing at the ground. His tail had grown rigid and twitched sharply from side to side, a sign in him of intense mental activity. Suddenly he halted as though his mind were made up.

"Comrades," he said quietly, "do you know who is responsible for this? Do you know the enemy who has come in the night and overthrown our windmill? Snowball!" he suddenly roared in a voice of thunder. "Snowball has done this thing! In sheer malignity, thinking to set back our plans and avenge himself for his ignominious expulsion, this traitor has crept here under cover of night and destroyed our work of nearly a year. Comrades, here and now I pronounce the death sentence upon Snowball. 'Animal Hero, Second Class,' and half a bushel of apples to any animal who brings him to justice. A full bushel to anyone who captures him alive!"

The animals were shocked beyond measure to learn that even Snowball could be guilty of such an action. There was a cry of indignation, and everyone began thinking out ways of catching Snowball if he should ever come back. Almost immediately the footprints of a pig were discovered in the grass at a little distance from the knoll. They could only be traced for a few yards, but appeared to lead to a hole in the hedge. Napoleon snuffed deeply at them and pronounced them to be Snowball's. He gave it as his opinion that Snowball had probably come from the direction of Foxwood Farm.

"No more delays, comrades!" cried Napoleon when the footprints had been examined. "There is work to be done. This very morning we begin rebuilding the windmill, and we will build all through the winter, rain or shine. We will teach this miserable traitor that he cannot undo our work so easily. Remember, comrades, there must be no alteration in our plans: they shall be carried out to the day. Forward, comrades! Long live the windmill! Long live Animal Farm!"





Chapter VII


It was a bitter winter. The stormy weather was followed by sleet and snow, and then by a hard frost which did not break till well into February. The animals carried on as best they could with the rebuilding of the windmill, well knowing that the outside world was watching them and that the envious human beings would rejoice and triumph if the mill were not finished on time.

Out of spite, the human beings pretended not to believe that it was Snowball who had destroyer the windmill: they said that it had fallen down because the walls were too thin. The animals knew that this was not the case. Still, it had been decided to build the walls three feet thick this time instead of eighteen inches as before, which meant collecting much larger quantities of stone. For a long time the quarry was full of snowdrifts and nothing could be done. Some progress was made in the dry frosty weather that followed, but it was cruel work, and the animals could not feel so hopeful about it as they had felt before. They were always cold, and usually hungry as well. Only Boxer and Clover never lost heart. Squealer made excellent speeches on the joy of service and the dignity of labour, but the other animals found more inspiration in Boxer's strength and his never-failing cry of "I will work harder!"

In January food fell short. The corn ration was drastically reduced, and it was announced that an extra potato ration would be issued to make up for it. Then it was discovered that the greater part of the potato crop had been frosted in the clamps, which had not been covered thickly enough. The potatoes had become soft and discoloured, and only a few were edible. For days at a time the animals had nothing to eat but chaff and mangels. Starvation seemed to stare them in the face.

It was vitally necessary to conceal this fact from the outside world. Emboldened by the collapse of the windmill, the human beings were inventing fresh lies about Animal Farm. Once again it was being put about that all the animals were dying of famine and disease, and that they were continually fighting among themselves and had resorted to cannibalism and infanticide. Napoleon was well aware of the bad results that might follow if the real facts of the food situation were known, and he decided to make use of Mr. Whymper to spread a contrary impression. Hitherto the animals had had little or no contact with Whymper on his weekly visits: now, however, a few selected animals, mostly sheep, were instructed to remark casually in his hearing that rations had been increased. In addition, Napoleon ordered the almost empty bins in the store-shed to be filled nearly to the brim with sand, which was then covered up with what remained of the grain and meal. On some suitable pretext Whymper was led through the store-shed and allowed to catch a glimpse of the bins. He was deceived, and continued to report to the outside world that there was no food shortage on Animal Farm.

Nevertheless, towards the end of January it became obvious that it would be necessary to procure some more grain from somewhere. In these days Napoleon rarely appeared in public, but spent all his time in the farmhouse, which was guarded at each door by fierce-looking dogs. When he did emerge, it was in a ceremonial manner, with an escort of six dogs who closely surrounded him and growled if anyone came too near. Frequently he did not even appear on Sunday mornings, but issued his orders through one of the other pigs, usually Squealer.

One Sunday morning Squealer announced that the hens, who had just come in to lay again, must surrender their eggs. Napoleon had accepted, through Whymper, a contract for four hundred eggs a week. The price of these would pay for enough grain and meal to keep the farm going till summer came on and conditions were easier.

When the hens heard this, they raised a terrible outcry. They had been warned earlier that this sacrifice might be necessary, but had not believed that it would really happen. They were just getting their clutches ready for the spring sitting, and they protested that to take the eggs away now was murder. For the first time since the expulsion of Jones, there was something resembling a rebellion. Led by three young Black Minorca pullets, the hens made a determined effort to thwart Napoleon's wishes. Their method was to fly up to the rafters and there lay their eggs, which smashed to pieces on the floor. Napoleon acted swiftly and ruthlessly. He ordered the hens' rations to be stopped, and decreed that any animal giving so much as a grain of corn to a hen should be punished by death. The dogs saw to it that these orders were carried out. For five days the hens held out, then they capitulated and went back to their nesting boxes. Nine hens had died in the meantime. Their bodies were buried in the orchard, and it was given out that they had died of coccidiosis. Whymper heard nothing of this affair, and the eggs were duly delivered, a grocer's van driving up to the farm once a week to take them away.

All this while no more had been seen of Snowball. He was rumoured to be hiding on one of the neighbouring farms, either Foxwood or Pinchfield. Napoleon was by this time on slightly better terms with the other farmers than before. It happened that there was in the yard a pile of timber which had been stacked there ten years earlier when a beech spinney was cleared. It was well seasoned, and Whymper had advised Napoleon to sell it; both Mr. Pilkington and Mr. Frederick were anxious to buy it. Napoleon was hesitating between the two, unable to make up his mind. It was noticed that whenever he seemed on the point of coming to an agreement with Frederick, Snowball was declared to be in hiding at Foxwood, while, when he inclined toward Pilkington, Snowball was said to be at Pinchfield.

Suddenly, early in the spring, an alarming thing was discovered. Snowball was secretly frequenting the farm by night! The animals were so disturbed that they could hardly sleep in their stalls. Every night, it was said, he came creeping in under cover of darkness and performed all kinds of mischief. He stole the corn, he upset the milk-pails, he broke the eggs, he trampled the seedbeds, he gnawed the bark off the fruit trees. Whenever anything went wrong it became usual to attribute it to Snowball. If a window was broken or a drain was blocked up, someone was certain to say that Snowball had come in the night and done it, and when the key of the store-shed was lost, the whole farm was convinced that Snowball had thrown it down the well. Curiously enough, they went on believing this even after the mislaid key was found under a sack of meal. The cows declared unanimously that Snowball crept into their stalls and milked them in their sleep. The rats, which had been troublesome that winter, were also said to be in league with Snowball.

Napoleon decreed that there should be a full investigation into Snowball's activities. With his dogs in attendance he set out and made a careful tour of inspection of the farm buildings, the other animals following at a respectful distance. At every few steps Napoleon stopped and snuffed the ground for traces of Snowball's footsteps, which, he said, he could detect by the smell. He snuffed in every corner, in the barn, in the cowshed, in the henhouses, in the vegetable garden, and found traces of Snowball almost everywhere. He would put his snout to the ground, give several deep sniffs, and exclaim in a terrible voice, "Snowball! He has been here! I can smell him distinctly!" and at the word "Snowball" all the dogs let out blood-curdling growls and showed their side teeth.

The animals were thoroughly frightened. It seemed to them as though Snowball were some kind of invisible influence, pervading the air about them and menacing them with all kinds of dangers. In the evening Squealer called them together, and with an alarmed expression on his face told them that he had some serious news to report.

"Comrades!" cried Squealer, making little nervous skips, "a most terrible thing has been discovered. Snowball has sold himself to Frederick of Pinchfield Farm, who is even now plotting to attack us and take our farm away from us! Snowball is to act as his guide when the attack begins. But there is worse than that. We had thought that Snowball's rebellion was caused simply by his vanity and ambition. But we were wrong, comrades. Do you know what the real reason was? Snowball was in league with Jones from the very start! He was Jones's secret agent all the time. It has all been proved by documents which he left behind him and which we have only just discovered. To my mind this explains a great deal, comrades. Did we not see for ourselves how he attempted fortunately without success to get us defeated and destroyed at the Battle of the Cowshed?"

The animals were stupefied. This was a wickedness far outdoing Snowball's destruction of the windmill. But it was some minutes before they could fully take it in. They all remembered, or thought they remembered, how they had seen Snowball charging ahead of them at the Battle of the Cowshed, how he had rallied and encouraged them at every turn, and how he had not paused for an instant even when the pellets from Jones's gun had wounded his back. At first it was a little difficult to see how this fitted in with his being on Jones's side. Even Boxer, who seldom asked questions, was puzzled. He lay down, tucked his fore hoofs beneath him, shut his eyes, and with a hard effort managed to formulate his thoughts.

"I do not believe that," he said. "Snowball fought bravely at the Battle of the Cowshed. I saw him myself. Did we not give him 'Animal Hero, first Class,' immediately afterwards?"

"That was our mistake, comrade. For we know now it is all written down in the secret documents that we have found that in reality he was trying to lure us to our doom."

"But he was wounded," said Boxer. "We all saw him running with blood."

"That was part of the arrangement!" cried Squealer. "Jones's shot only grazed him. I could show you this in his own writing, if you were able to read it. The plot was for Snowball, at the critical moment, to give the signal for flight and leave the field to the enemy. And he very nearly succeeded, I will even say, comrades, he would have succeeded if it had not been for our heroic Leader, Comrade Napoleon. Do you not remember how, just at the moment when Jones and his men had got inside the yard, Snowball suddenly turned and fled, and many animals followed him? And do you not remember, too, that it was just at that moment, when panic was spreading and all seemed lost, that Comrade Napoleon sprang forward with a cry of 'Death to Humanity!' and sank his teeth in Jones's leg? Surely you remember that, comrades?" exclaimed Squealer, frisking from side to side.

Now when Squealer described the scene so graphically, it seemed to the animals that they did remember it. At any rate, they remembered that at the critical moment of the battle Snowball had turned to flee. But Boxer was still a little uneasy.

"I do not believe that Snowball was a traitor at the beginning," he said finally. "What he has done since is different. But I believe that at the Battle of the Cowshed he was a good comrade."

"Our Leader, Comrade Napoleon," announced Squealer, speaking very slowly and firmly, "has stated categorically, comrade, that Snowball was Jones's agent from the very beginning, yes, and from long before the Rebellion was ever thought of."

"Ah, that is different!" said Boxer. "If Comrade Napoleon says it, it must be right."

"That is the true spirit, comrade!" cried Squealer, but it was noticed he cast a very ugly look at Boxer with his little twinkling eyes. He turned to go, then paused and added impressively: "I warn every animal on this farm to keep his eyes very wide open. For we have reason to think that some of Snowball's secret agents are lurking among us at this moment!"

Four days later, in the late afternoon, Napoleon ordered all the animals to assemble in the yard. When they were all gathered together, Napoleon emerged from the farmhouse, wearing both his medals (for he had recently awarded himself "Animal Hero, First Class," and "Animal Hero, Second Class"), with his nine huge dogs frisking round him and uttering growls that sent shivers down all the animals' spines. They all cowered silently in their places, seeming to know in advance that some terrible thing was about to happen.

Napoleon stood sternly surveying his audience; then he uttered a high-pitched whimper. Immediately the dogs bounded forward, seized four of the pigs by the ear and dragged them, squealing with pain and terror, to Napoleon's feet. The pigs' ears were bleeding, the dogs had tasted blood, and for a few moments they appeared to go quite mad. To the amazement of everybody, three of them flung themselves upon Boxer. Boxer saw them coming and put out his great hoof, caught a dog in mid-air, and pinned him to the ground. The dog shrieked for mercy and the other two fled with their tails between their legs. Boxer looked at Napoleon to know whether he should crush the dog to death or let it go. Napoleon appeared to change countenance, and sharply ordered Boxer to let the dog go, whereat Boxer lifted his hoof, and the dog slunk away, bruised and howling.

Presently the tumult died down. The four pigs waited, trembling, with guilt written on every line of their countenances. Napoleon now called upon them to confess their crimes. They were the same four pigs as had protested when Napoleon abolished the Sunday Meetings. Without any further prompting they confessed that they had been secretly in touch with Snowball ever since his expulsion, that they had collaborated with him in destroying the windmill, and that they had entered into an agreement with him to hand over Animal Farm to Mr. Frederick. They added that Snowball had privately admitted to them that he had been Jones's secret agent for years past. When they had finished their confession, the dogs promptly tore their throats out, and in a terrible voice Napoleon demanded whether any other animal had anything to confess.

The three hens who had been the ringleaders in the attempted rebellion over the eggs now came forward and stated that Snowball had appeared to them in a dream and incited them to disobey Napoleon's orders. They, too, were slaughtered. Then a goose came forward and confessed to having secreted six ears of corn during the last year's harvest and eaten them in the night. Then a sheep confessed to having urinated in the drinking pool—urged to do this, so she said, by Snowball, and two other sheep confessed to having murdered an old ram, an especially devoted follower of Napoleon, by chasing him round and round a bonfire when he was suffering from a cough. They were all slain on the spot. And so the tale of confessions and executions went on, until there was a pile of corpses lying before Napoleon's feet and the air was heavy with the smell of blood, which had been unknown there since the expulsion of Jones.

When it was all over, the remaining animals, except for the pigs and dogs, crept away in a body. They were shaken and miserable. They did not know which was more shocking—the treachery of the animals who had leagued themselves with Snowball, or the cruel retribution they had just witnessed. In the old days there had often been scenes of bloodshed equally terrible, but it seemed to all of them that it was far worse now that it was happening among themselves. Since Jones had left the farm, until today, no animal had killed another animal. Not even a rat had been killed. They had made their way on to the little knoll where the half-finished windmill stood, and with one accord they all lay down as though huddling together for warmth, Clover, Muriel, Benjamin, the cows, the sheep, and a whole flock of geese and hens, everyone, indeed, except the cat, who had suddenly disappeared just before Napoleon ordered the animals to assemble. For some time nobody spoke. Only Boxer remained on his feet. He fidgeted to and fro, swishing his long black tail against his sides and occasionally uttering a little whinny of surprise. Finally he said:

"I do not understand it. I would not have believed that such things could happen on our farm. It must be due to some fault in ourselves. The solution, as I see it, is to work harder. From now onwards I shall get up a full hour earlier in the mornings."

And he moved off at his lumbering trot and made for the quarry. Having got there, he collected two successive loads of stone and dragged them down to the windmill before retiring for the night.

The animals huddled about Clover, not speaking. The knoll where they were lying gave them a wide prospect across the countryside. Most of Animal Farm was within their view—the long pasture stretching down to the main road, the hayfield, the spinney, the drinking pool, the ploughed fields where the young wheat was thick and green, and the red roofs of the farm buildings with the smoke curling from the chimneys. It was a clear spring evening. The grass and the bursting hedges were gilded by the level rays of the sun. Never had the farm and with a kind of surprise they remembered that it was their own farm, every inch of it their own property—appeared to the animals so desirable a place. As Clover looked down the hillside her eyes filled with tears. If she could have spoken her thoughts, it would have been to say that this was not what they had aimed at when they had set themselves years ago to work for the overthrow of the human race. These scenes of terror and slaughter were not what they had looked forward to on that night when old Major first stirred them to rebellion. If she herself had had any picture of the future, it had been of a society of animals set free from hunger and the whip, all equal, each working according to his capacity, the strong protecting the weak, as she had protected the lost brood of ducklings with her foreleg on the night of Major's speech. Instead, she did not know why they had come to a time when no one dared speak his mind, when fierce, growling dogs roamed everywhere, and when you had to watch your comrades torn to pieces after confessing to shocking crimes. There was no thought of rebellion or disobedience in her mind. She knew that, even as things were, they were far better off than they had been in the days of Jones, and that before all else it was needful to prevent the return of the human beings. Whatever happened she would remain faithful, work hard, carry out the orders that were given to her, and accept the leadership of Napoleon. But still, it was not for this that she and all the other animals had hoped and toiled. It was not for this that they had built the windmill and faced the bullets of Jones's gun. Such were her thoughts, though she lacked the words to express them.

At last, feeling this to be in some way a substitute for the words she was unable to find, she began to sing Beasts of England. The other animals sitting round her took it up, and they sang it three times over, very tunefully, but slowly and mournfully, in a way they had never sung it before.

They had just finished singing it for the third time when Squealer, attended by two dogs, approached them with the air of having something important to say. He announced that, by a special decree of Comrade Napoleon, Beasts of England had been abolished. From now onwards it was forbidden to sing it.

The animals were taken aback.

"Why?" cried Muriel.

"It's no longer needed, comrade," said Squealer stiffly. "Beasts of England was the song of the Rebellion. But the Rebellion is now completed. The execution of the traitors this afternoon was the final act. The enemy both external and internal has been defeated. In Beasts of England we expressed our longing for a better society in days to come. But that society has now been established. Clearly this song has no longer any purpose."

Frightened though they were, some of the animals might possibly have protested, but at this moment the sheep set up their usual bleating of "Four legs good, two legs bad," which went on for several minutes and put an end to the discussion.

So Beasts of England was heard no more. In its place Minimus, the poet, had composed another song which began:





Animal Farm, Animal Farm,

Never through me shalt thou come to harm!





And this was sung every Sunday morning after the hoisting of the flag. But somehow neither the words nor the tune ever seemed to the animals to come up to Beasts of England.





Chapter VIII


A few days later, when the terror caused by the executions had died down, some of the animals remembered—or thought they remembered—that the Sixth Commandment decreed "No animal shall kill any other animal." And though no one cared to mention it in the hearing of the pigs or the dogs, it was felt that the killings which had taken place did not square with this. Clover asked Benjamin to read her the Sixth Commandment, and when Benjamin, as usual, said that he refused to meddle in such matters, she fetched Muriel. Muriel read the Commandment for her. It ran: "No animal shall kill any other animal without cause." Somehow or other, the last two words had slipped out of the animals' memory. But they saw now that the Commandment had not been violated; for clearly there was good reason for killing the traitors who had leagued themselves with Snowball.

Throughout the year the animals worked even harder than they had worked in the previous year. To rebuild the windmill, with walls twice as thick as before, and to finish it by the appointed date, together with the regular work of the farm, was a tremendous labour. There were times when it seemed to the animals that they worked longer hours and fed no better than they had done in Jones's day. On Sunday mornings Squealer, holding down a long strip of paper with his trotter, would read out to them lists of figures proving that the production of every class of foodstuff had increased by two hundred per cent, three hundred per cent, or five hundred per cent, as the case might be. The animals saw no reason to disbelieve him, especially as they could no longer remember very clearly what conditions had been like before the Rebellion. All the same, there were days when they felt that they would sooner have had less figures and more food.

All orders were now issued through Squealer or one of the other pigs. Napoleon himself was not seen in public as often as once in a fortnight. When he did appear, he was attended not only by his retinue of dogs but by a black cockerel who marched in front of him and acted as a kind of trumpeter, letting out a loud "cock-a-doodle-doo" before Napoleon spoke. Even in the farmhouse, it was said, Napoleon inhabited separate apartments from the others. He took his meals alone, with two dogs to wait upon him, and always ate from the Crown Derby dinner service which had been in the glass cupboard in the drawing-room. It was also announced that the gun would be fired every year on Napoleon's birthday, as well as on the other two anniversaries.

Napoleon was now never spoken of simply as "Napoleon." He was always referred to in formal style as "our Leader, Comrade Napoleon," and this pigs liked to invent for him such titles as Father of All Animals, Terror of Mankind, Protector of the Sheep-fold, Ducklings' Friend, and the like. In his speeches, Squealer would talk with the tears rolling down his cheeks of Napoleon's wisdom the goodness of his heart, and the deep love he bore to all animals everywhere, even and especially the unhappy animals who still lived in ignorance and slavery on other farms. It had become usual to give Napoleon the credit for every successful achievement and every stroke of good fortune. You would often hear one hen remark to another: "Under the guidance of our Leader, Comrade Napoleon, I have laid five eggs in six days"; or two cows, enjoying a drink at the pool, would exclaim: "Thanks to the leadership of Comrade Napoleon, how excellent this water tastes!" The general feeling on the farm was well expressed in a poem entitled Comrade Napoleon, which was composed by Minimus and which ran as follows:





Friend of fatherless!

Fountain of happiness!

Lord of the swill-bucket! Oh, how my soul is on

Fire when I gaze at thy

Calm and commanding eye,

Like the sun in the sky,

Comrade Napoleon!





Thou are the giver of

All that thy creatures love,

Full belly twice a day, clean straw to roll upon;

Every beast great or small

Sleeps at peace in his stall,

Thou watchest over all,

Comrade Napoleon!





Had I a sucking-pig,

Ere he had grown as big

Even as a pint bottle or as a rolling-pin,

He should have learned to be

Faithful and true to thee,

Yes, his first squeak should be

"Comrade Napoleon!"





Napoleon approved of this poem and caused it to be inscribed on the wall of the big barn, at the opposite end from the Seven Commandments. It was surmounted by a portrait of Napoleon, in profile, executed by Squealer in white paint.

Meanwhile, through the agency of Whymper, Napoleon was engaged in complicated negotiations with Frederick and Pilkington. The pile of timber was still unsold. Of the two, Frederick was the more anxious to get hold of it, but he would not offer a reasonable price. At the same time there were renewed rumours that Frederick and his men were plotting to attack Animal Farm and to destroy the windmill, the building of which had aroused furious jealousy in him. Snowball was known to be still skulking on Pinchfield Farm. In the middle of the summer the animals were alarmed to hear that three hens had come forward and confessed that, inspired by Snowball, they had entered into a plot to murder Napoleon. They were executed immediately, and fresh precautions for Napoleon's safety were taken. Four dogs guarded his bed at night, one at each corner, and a young pig named Pinkeye was given the task of tasting all his food before he ate it, lest it should be poisoned.

At about the same time it was given out that Napoleon had arranged to sell the pile of timber to Mr. Pilkington; he was also going to enter into a regular agreement for the exchange of certain products between Animal Farm and Foxwood. The relations between Napoleon and Pilkington, though they were only conducted through Whymper, were now almost friendly. The animals distrusted Pilkington, as a human being, but greatly preferred him to Frederick, whom they both feared and hated. As the summer wore on, and the windmill neared completion, the rumours of an impending treacherous attack grew stronger and stronger. Frederick, it was said, intended to bring against them twenty men all armed with guns, and he had already bribed the magistrates and police, so that if he could once get hold of the title-deeds of Animal Farm they would ask no questions. Moreover, terrible stories were leaking out from Pinchfield about the cruelties that Frederick practised upon his animals. He had flogged an old horse to death, he starved his cows, he had killed a dog by throwing it into the furnace, he amused himself in the evenings by making cocks fight with splinters of razor-blade tied to their spurs. The animals' blood boiled with rage when they heard of these things being done to their comrades, and sometimes they clamoured to be allowed to go out in a body and attack Pinchfield Farm, drive out the humans, and set the animals free. But Squealer counselled them to avoid rash actions and trust in Comrade Napoleon's strategy.

Nevertheless, feeling against Frederick continued to run high. One Sunday morning Napoleon appeared in the barn and explained that he had never at any time contemplated selling the pile of timber to Frederick; he considered it beneath his dignity, he said, to have dealings with scoundrels of that description. The pigeons who were still sent out to spread tidings of the Rebellion were forbidden to set foot anywhere on Foxwood, and were also ordered to drop their former slogan of "Death to Humanity" in favour of "Death to Frederick." In the late summer yet another of Snowball's machinations was laid bare. The wheat crop was full of weeds, and it was discovered that on one of his nocturnal visits Snowball had mixed weed seeds with the seed corn. A gander who had been privy to the plot had confessed his guilt to Squealer and immediately committed suicide by swallowing deadly nightshade berries. The animals now also learned that Snowball had never as many of them had believed hitherto received the order of "Animal Hero First Class." This was merely a legend which had been spread some time after the Battle of the Cowshed by Snowball himself. So far from being decorated, he had been censured for showing cowardice in the battle. Once again some of the animals heard this with a certain bewilderment, but Squealer was soon able to convince them that their memories had been at fault.

In the autumn, by a tremendous, exhausting effort for the harvest had to be gathered at almost the same time the windmill was finished. The machinery had still to be installed, and Whymper was negotiating the purchase of it, but the structure was completed. In the teeth of every difficulty, in spite of inexperience, of primitive implements, of bad luck and of Snowball's treachery, the work had been finished punctually to the very day! Tired out but proud, the animals walked round and round their masterpiece, which appeared even more beautiful in their eyes than when it had been built the first time. Moreover, the walls were twice as thick as before. Nothing short of explosives would lay them low this time! And when they thought of how they had laboured, what discouragements they had overcome, and the enormous difference that would be made in their lives when the sails were turning and the dynamos running—when they thought of all this, their tiredness forsook them and they gambolled round and round the windmill, uttering cries of triumph. Napoleon himself, attended by his dogs and his cockerel, came down to inspect the completed work; he personally congratulated the animals on their achievement, and announced that the mill would be named Napoleon Mill.

Two days later the animals were called together for a special meeting in the barn. They were struck dumb with surprise when Napoleon announced that he had sold the pile of timber to Frederick. Tomorrow Frederick's wagons would arrive and begin carting it away. Throughout the whole period of his seeming friendship with Pilkington, Napoleon had really been in secret agreement with Frederick.

All relations with Foxwood had been broken off; insulting messages had been sent to Pilkington. The pigeons had been told to avoid Pinchfield Farm and to alter their slogan from "Death to Frederick" to "Death to Pilkington." At the same time Napoleon assured the animals that the stories of an impending attack on Animal Farm were completely untrue, and that the tales about Frederick's cruelty to his own animals had been greatly exaggerated. All these rumours had probably originated with Snowball and his agents. It now appeared that Snowball was not, after all, hiding on Pinchfield Farm, and in fact had never been there in his life: he was living in considerable luxury, so it was said at Foxwood, and had in reality been a pensioner of Pilkington for years past.

The pigs were in ecstasies over Napoleon's cunning. By seeming to be friendly with Pilkington he had forced Frederick to raise his price by twelve pounds. But the superior quality of Napoleon's mind, said Squealer, was shown in the fact that he trusted nobody, not even Frederick. Frederick had wanted to pay for the timber with something called a cheque, which, it seemed, was a piece of paper with a promise to pay written upon it. But Napoleon was too clever for him. He had demanded payment in real five-pound notes, which were to be handed over before the timber was removed. Already Frederick had paid up; and the sum he had paid was just enough to buy the machinery for the windmill.

Meanwhile the timber was being carted away at high speed. When it was all gone, another special meeting was held in the barn for the animals to inspect Frederick's bank-notes. Smiling beatifically, and wearing both his decorations, Napoleon reposed on a bed of straw on the platform, with the money at his side, neatly piled on a china dish from the farmhouse kitchen. The animals filed slowly past, and each gazed his fill. And Boxer put out his nose to sniff at the bank-notes, and the flimsy white things stirred and rustled in his breath.

Three days later there was a terrible hullabaloo. Whymper, his face deadly pale, came racing up the path on his bicycle, flung it down in the yard and rushed straight into the farmhouse. The next moment a choking roar of rage sounded from Napoleon's apartments. The news of what had happened sped round the farm like wildfire. The banknotes were forgeries! Frederick had got the timber for nothing!

Napoleon called the animals together immediately and in a terrible voice pronounced the death sentence upon Frederick. When captured, he said, Frederick should be boiled alive. At the same time he warned them that after this treacherous deed the worst was to be expected. Frederick and his men might make their long-expected attack at any moment. Sentinels were placed at all the approaches to the farm. In addition, four pigeons were sent to Foxwood with a conciliatory message, which it was hoped might reestablish good relations with Pilkington.

The very next morning the attack came. The animals were at breakfast when the look-outs came racing in with the news that Frederick and his followers had already come through the five-barred gate. Boldly enough the animals sallied forth to meet them, but this time they did not have the easy victory that they had had in the Battle of the Cowshed. There were fifteen men, with half a dozen guns between them, and they opened fire as soon as they got within fifty yards. The animals could not face the terrible explosions and the stinging pellets, and in spite of the efforts of Napoleon and Boxer to rally them, they were soon driven back. A number of them were already wounded. They took refuge in the farm buildings and peeped cautiously out from chinks and knot-holes. The whole of the big pasture, including the windmill, was in the hands of the enemy. For the moment even Napoleon seemed at a loss. He paced up and down without a word, his tail rigid and twitching. Wistful glances were sent in the direction of Foxwood. If Pilkington and his men would help them, the day might yet be won. But at this moment the four pigeons, who had been sent out on the day before, returned, one of them bearing a scrap of paper from Pilkington. On it was pencilled the words: "Serves you right."

Meanwhile Frederick and his men had halted about the windmill. The animals watched them, and a murmur of dismay went round. Two of the men had produced a crowbar and a sledgehammer. They were going to knock the windmill down.

"Impossible!" cried Napoleon. "We have built the walls far too thick for that. They could not knock it down in a week. Courage, comrades!"

But Benjamin was watching the movements of the men intently. The two with the hammer and the crowbar were drilling a hole near the base of the windmill. Slowly, and with an air almost of amusement, Benjamin nodded his long muzzle.

"I thought so," he said. "Do you not see what they are doing? In another moment they are going to pack blasting powder into that hole."

Terrified, the animals waited. It was impossible now to venture out of the shelter of the buildings. After a few minutes the men were seen to be running in all directions. Then there was a deafening roar. The pigeons swirled into the air, and all the animals, except Napoleon, flung themselves flat on their bellies and hid their faces. When they got up again, a huge cloud of black smoke was hanging where the windmill had been. Slowly the breeze drifted it away. The windmill had ceased to exist!

At this sight the animals' courage returned to them. The fear and despair they had felt a moment earlier were drowned in their rage against this vile, contemptible act. A mighty cry for vengeance went up, and without waiting for further orders they charged forth in a body and made straight for the enemy. This time they did not heed the cruel pellets that swept over them like hail. It was a savage, bitter battle. The men fired again and again, and, when the animals got to close quarters, lashed out with their sticks and their heavy boots. A cow, three sheep, and two geese were killed, and nearly everyone was wounded. Even Napoleon, who was directing operations from the rear, had the tip of his tail chipped by a pellet. But the men did not go unscathed either. Three of them had their heads broken by blows from Boxer's hoofs; another was gored in the belly by a cow's horn; another had his trousers nearly torn off by Jessie and Bluebell. And when the nine dogs of Napoleon's own bodyguard, whom he had instructed to make a detour under cover of the hedge, suddenly appeared on the men's flank, baying ferociously, panic overtook them. They saw that they were in danger of being surrounded. Frederick shouted to his men to get out while the going was good, and the next moment the cowardly enemy was running for dear life. The animals chased them right down to the bottom of the field, and got in some last kicks at them as they forced their way through the thorn hedge.

They had won, but they were weary and bleeding. Slowly they began to limp back towards the farm. The sight of their dead comrades stretched upon the grass moved some of them to tears. And for a little while they halted in sorrowful silence at the place where the windmill had once stood. Yes, it was gone; almost the last trace of their labour was gone! Even the foundations were partially destroyed. And in rebuilding it they could not this time, as before, make use of the fallen stones. This time the stones had vanished too. The force of the explosion had flung them to distances of hundreds of yards. It was as though the windmill had never been.

As they approached the farm Squealer, who had unaccountably been absent during the fighting, came skipping towards them, whisking his tail and beaming with satisfaction. And the animals heard, from the direction of the farm buildings, the solemn booming of a gun.

"What is that gun firing for?" said Boxer.

"To celebrate our victory!" cried Squealer.

"What victory?" said Boxer. His knees were bleeding, he had lost a shoe and split his hoof, and a dozen pellets had lodged themselves in his hind leg.

"What victory, comrade? Have we not driven the enemy off our soil—the sacred soil of Animal Farm?"

"But they have destroyed the windmill. And we had worked on it for two years!"

"What matter? We will build another windmill. We will build six windmills if we feel like it. You do not appreciate, comrade, the mighty thing that we have done. The enemy was in occupation of this very ground that we stand upon. And now, thanks to the leadership of Comrade Napoleon, we have won every inch of it back again!"

"Then we have won back what we had before," said Boxer.

"That is our victory," said Squealer.

They limped into the yard. The pellets under the skin of Boxer's leg smarted painfully. He saw ahead of him the heavy labour of rebuilding the windmill from the foundations, and already in imagination he braced himself for the task. But for the first time it occurred to him that he was eleven years old and that perhaps his great muscles were not quite what they had once been.

But when the animals saw the green flag flying, and heard the gun firing again—seven times it was fired in all and heard the speech that Napoleon made, congratulating them on their conduct, it did seem to them after all that they had won a great victory. The animals slain in the battle were given a solemn funeral. Boxer and Clover pulled the wagon which served as a hearse, and Napoleon himself walked at the head of the procession. Two whole days were given over to celebrations. There were songs, speeches, and more firing of the gun, and a special gift of an apple was bestowed on every animal, with two ounces of corn for each bird and three biscuits for each dog. It was announced that the battle would be called the Battle of the Windmill, and that Napoleon had created a new decoration, the Order of the Green Banner, which he had conferred upon himself. In the general rejoicings the unfortunate affair of the banknotes was forgotten.

It was a few days later than this that the pigs came upon a case of whisky in the cellars of the farmhouse. It had been overlooked at the time when the house was first occupied. That night there came from the farmhouse the sound of loud singing, in which, to everyone's surprise, the strains of Beasts of England were mixed up. At about half past nine Napoleon, wearing an old bowler hat of Mr. Jones's, was distinctly seen to emerge from the back door, gallop rapidly round the yard, and disappear indoors again. But in the morning a deep silence hung over the farmhouse. Not a pig appeared to be stirring. It was nearly nine o'clock when Squealer made his appearance, walking slowly and dejectedly, his eyes dull, his tail hanging limply behind him, and with every appearance of being seriously ill. He called the animals together and told them that he had a terrible piece of news to impart. Comrade Napoleon was dying!

A cry of lamentation went up. Straw was laid down outside the doors of the farmhouse, and the animals walked on tiptoe. With tears in their eyes they asked one another what they should do if their Leader were taken away from them. A rumour went round that Snowball had after all contrived to introduce poison into Napoleon's food. At eleven o'clock Squealer came out to make another announcement. As his last act upon earth, Comrade Napoleon had pronounced a solemn decree: the drinking of alcohol was to be punished by death.

By the evening, however, Napoleon appeared to be somewhat better, and the following morning Squealer was able to tell them that he was well on the way to recovery. By the evening of that day Napoleon was back at work, and on the next day it was learned that he had instructed Whymper to purchase in Willingdon some booklets on brewing and distilling. A week later Napoleon gave orders that the small paddock beyond the orchard, which it had previously been intended to set aside as a grazing-ground for animals who were past work, was to be ploughed up. It was given out that the pasture was exhausted and needed re-seeding; but it soon became known that Napoleon intended to sow it with barley.

About this time there occurred a strange incident which hardly anyone was able to understand. One night at about twelve o'clock there was a loud crash in the yard, and the animals rushed out of their stalls. It was a moonlit night. At the foot of the end wall of the big barn, where the Seven Commandments were written, there lay a ladder broken in two pieces. Squealer, temporarily stunned, was sprawling beside it, and near at hand there lay a lantern, a paint-brush, and an overturned pot of white paint. The dogs immediately made a ring round Squealer, and escorted him back to the farmhouse as soon as he was able to walk. None of the animals could form any idea as to what this meant, except old Benjamin, who nodded his muzzle with a knowing air, and seemed to understand, but would say nothing.

But a few days later Muriel, reading over the Seven Commandments to herself, noticed that there was yet another of them which the animals had remembered wrong. They had thought the Fifth Commandment was "No animal shall drink alcohol," but there were two words that they had forgotten. Actually the Commandment read: "No animal shall drink alcohol to excess."





Chapter IX


Boxer's split hoof was a long time in healing. They had started the rebuilding of the windmill the day after the victory celebrations were ended. Boxer refused to take even a day off work, and made it a point of honour not to let it be seen that he was in pain. In the evenings he would admit privately to Clover that the hoof troubled him a great deal. Clover treated the hoof with poultices of herbs which she prepared by chewing them, and both she and Benjamin urged Boxer to work less hard. "A horse's lungs do not last for ever," she said to him. But Boxer would not listen. He had, he said, only one real ambition left—to see the windmill well under way before he reached the age for retirement.

At the beginning, when the laws of Animal Farm were first formulated, the retiring age had been fixed for horses and pigs at twelve, for cows at fourteen, for dogs at nine, for sheep at seven, and for hens and geese at five. Liberal old-age pensions had been agreed upon. As yet no animal had actually retired on pension, but of late the subject had been discussed more and more. Now that the small field beyond the orchard had been set aside for barley, it was rumoured that a corner of the large pasture was to be fenced off and turned into a grazing-ground for superannuated animals. For a horse, it was said, the pension would be five pounds of corn a day and, in winter, fifteen pounds of hay, with a carrot or possibly an apple on public holidays. Boxer's twelfth birthday was due in the late summer of the following year.

Meanwhile life was hard. The winter was as cold as the last one had been, and food was even shorter. Once again all rations were reduced, except those of the pigs and the dogs. A too rigid equality in rations, Squealer explained, would have been contrary to the principles of Animalism. In any case he had no difficulty in proving to the other animals that they were not in reality short of food, whatever the appearances might be. For the time being, certainly, it had been found necessary to make a readjustment of rations (Squealer always spoke of it as a "readjustment," never as a "reduction"), but in comparison with the days of Jones, the improvement was enormous. Reading out the figures in a shrill, rapid voice, he proved to them in detail that they had more oats, more hay, more turnips than they had had in Jones's day, that they worked shorter hours, that their drinking water was of better quality, that they lived longer, that a larger proportion of their young ones survived infancy, and that they had more straw in their stalls and suffered less from fleas. The animals believed every word of it. Truth to tell, Jones and all he stood for had almost faded out of their memories. They knew that life nowadays was harsh and bare, that they were often hungry and often cold, and that they were usually working when they were not asleep. But doubtless it had been worse in the old days. They were glad to believe so. Besides, in those days they had been slaves and now they were free, and that made all the difference, as Squealer did not fail to point out.

There were many more mouths to feed now. In the autumn the four sows had all littered about simultaneously, producing thirty-one young pigs between them. The young pigs were piebald, and as Napoleon was the only boar on the farm, it was possible to guess at their parentage. It was announced that later, when bricks and timber had been purchased, a schoolroom would be built in the farmhouse garden. For the time being, the young pigs were given their instruction by Napoleon himself in the farmhouse kitchen. They took their exercise in the garden, and were discouraged from playing with the other young animals. About this time, too, it was laid down as a rule that when a pig and any other animal met on the path, the other animal must stand aside: and also that all pigs, of whatever degree, were to have the privilege of wearing green ribbons on their tails on Sundays.

The farm had had a fairly successful year, but was still short of money. There were the bricks, sand, and lime for the schoolroom to be purchased, and it would also be necessary to begin saving up again for the machinery for the windmill. Then there were lamp oil and candles for the house, sugar for Napoleon's own table (he forbade this to the other pigs, on the ground that it made them fat), and all the usual replacements such as tools, nails, string, coal, wire, scrap-iron, and dog biscuits. A stump of hay and part of the potato crop were sold off, and the contract for eggs was increased to six hundred a week, so that that year the hens barely hatched enough chicks to keep their numbers at the same level. Rations, reduced in December, were reduced again in February, and lanterns in the stalls were forbidden to save Oil. But the pigs seemed comfortable enough, and in fact were putting on weight if anything. One afternoon in late February a warm, rich, appetising scent, such as the animals had never smelt before, wafted itself across the yard from the little brew-house, which had been disused in Jones's time, and which stood beyond the kitchen. Someone said it was the smell of cooking barley. The animals sniffed the air hungrily and wondered whether a warm mash was being prepared for their supper. But no warm mash appeared, and on the following Sunday it was announced that from now onwards all barley would be reserved for the pigs. The field beyond the orchard had already been sown with barley. And the news soon leaked out that every pig was now receiving a ration of a pint of beer daily, with half a gallon for Napoleon himself, which was always served to him in the Crown Derby soup tureen.

But if there were hardships to be borne, they were partly offset by the fact that life nowadays had a greater dignity than it had had before. There were more songs, more speeches, more processions. Napoleon had commanded that once a week there should be held something called a Spontaneous Demonstration, the object of which was to celebrate the struggles and triumphs of Animal Farm. At the appointed time the animals would leave their work and march round the precincts of the farm in military formation, with the pigs leading, then the horses, then the cows, then the sheep, and then the poultry. The dogs flanked the procession and at the head of all marched Napoleon's black cockerel. Boxer and Clover always carried between them a green banner marked with the hoof and the horn and the caption, "Long live Comrade Napoleon!" Afterwards there were recitations of poems composed in Napoleon's honour, and a speech by Squealer giving particulars of the latest increases in the production of foodstuffs, and on occasion a shot was fired from the gun. The sheep were the greatest devotees of the Spontaneous Demonstration, and if anyone complained (as a few animals sometimes did, when no pigs or dogs were near) that they wasted time and meant a lot of standing about in the cold, the sheep were sure to silence him with a tremendous bleating of "Four legs good, two legs bad!" But by and large the animals enjoyed these celebrations. They found it comforting to be reminded that, after all, they were truly their own masters and that the work they did was for their own benefit. So that, what with the songs, the processions, Squealer's lists of figures, the thunder of the gun, the crowing of the cockerel, and the fluttering of the flag, they were able to forget that their bellies were empty, at least part of the time.

In April, Animal Farm was proclaimed a Republic, and it became necessary to elect a President. There was only one candidate, Napoleon, who was elected unanimously. On the same day it was given out that fresh documents had been discovered which revealed further details about Snowball's complicity with Jones. It now appeared that Snowball had not, as the animals had previously imagined, merely attempted to lose the Battle of the Cowshed by means of a stratagem, but had been openly fighting on Jones's side. In fact, it was he who had actually been the leader of the human forces, and had charged into battle with the words "Long live Humanity!" on his lips. The wounds on Snowball's back, which a few of the animals still remembered to have seen, had been inflicted by Napoleon's teeth.

In the middle of the summer Moses the raven suddenly reappeared on the farm, after an absence of several years. He was quite unchanged, still did no work, and talked in the same strain as ever about Sugarcandy Mountain. He would perch on a stump, flap his black wings, and talk by the hour to anyone who would listen. "Up there, comrades," he would say solemnly, pointing to the sky with his large beak—"up there, just on the other side of that dark cloud that you can see there it lies, Sugarcandy Mountain, that happy country where we poor animals shall rest for ever from our labours!" He even claimed to have been there on one of his higher flights, and to have seen the everlasting fields of clover and the linseed cake and lump sugar growing on the hedges. Many of the animals believed him. Their lives now, they reasoned, were hungry and laborious; was it not right and just that a better world should exist somewhere else? A thing that was difficult to determine was the attitude of the pigs towards Moses. They all declared contemptuously that his stories about Sugarcandy Mountain were lies, and yet they allowed him to remain on the farm, not working, with an allowance of a gill of beer a day.

After his hoof had healed up, Boxer worked harder than ever. Indeed, all the animals worked like slaves that year. Apart from the regular work of the farm, and the rebuilding of the windmill, there was the schoolhouse for the young pigs, which was started in March. Sometimes the long hours on insufficient food were hard to bear, but Boxer never faltered. In nothing that he said or did was there any sign that his strength was not what it had been. It was only his appearance that was a little altered; his hide was less shiny than it had used to be, and his great haunches seemed to have shrunken. The others said, "Boxer will pick up when the spring grass comes on"; but the spring came and Boxer grew no fatter. Sometimes on the slope leading to the top of the quarry, when he braced his muscles against the weight of some vast boulder, it seemed that nothing kept him on his feet except the will to continue. At such times his lips were seen to form the words, "I will work harder"; he had no voice left. Once again Clover and Benjamin warned him to take care of his health, but Boxer paid no attention. His twelfth birthday was approaching. He did not care what happened so long as a good store of stone was accumulated before he went on pension.

Late one evening in the summer, a sudden rumour ran round the farm that something had happened to Boxer. He had gone out alone to drag a load of stone down to the windmill. And sure enough, the rumour was true. A few minutes later two pigeons came racing in with the news: "Boxer has fallen! He is lying on his side and can't get up!"

About half the animals on the farm rushed out to the knoll where the windmill stood. There lay Boxer, between the shafts of the cart, his neck stretched out, unable even to raise his head. His eyes were glazed, his sides matted with sweat. A thin stream of blood had trickled out of his mouth. Clover dropped to her knees at his side.

"Boxer!" she cried, "how are you?"

"It is my lung," said Boxer in a weak voice. "It does not matter. I think you will be able to finish the windmill without me. There is a pretty good store of stone accumulated. I had only another month to go in any case. To tell you the truth, I had been looking forward to my retirement. And perhaps, as Benjamin is growing old too, they will let him retire at the same time and be a companion to me."

"We must get help at once," said Clover. "Run, somebody, and tell Squealer what has happened."

All the other animals immediately raced back to the farmhouse to give Squealer the news. Only Clover remained, and Benjamin who lay down at Boxer's side, and, without speaking, kept the flies off him with his long tail. After about a quarter of an hour Squealer appeared, full of sympathy and concern. He said that Comrade Napoleon had learned with the very deepest distress of this misfortune to one of the most loyal workers on the farm, and was already making arrangements to send Boxer to be treated in the hospital at Willingdon. The animals felt a little uneasy at this. Except for Mollie and Snowball, no other animal had ever left the farm, and they did not like to think of their sick comrade in the hands of human beings. However, Squealer easily convinced them that the veterinary surgeon in Willingdon could treat Boxer's case more satisfactorily than could be done on the farm. And about half an hour later, when Boxer had somewhat recovered, he was with difficulty got on to his feet, and managed to limp back to his stall, where Clover and Benjamin had prepared a good bed of straw for him.

For the next two days Boxer remained in his stall. The pigs had sent out a large bottle of pink medicine which they had found in the medicine chest in the bathroom, and Clover administered it to Boxer twice a day after meals. In the evenings she lay in his stall and talked to him, while Benjamin kept the flies off him. Boxer professed not to be sorry for what had happened. If he made a good recovery, he might expect to live another three years, and he looked forward to the peaceful days that he would spend in the corner of the big pasture. It would be the first time that he had had leisure to study and improve his mind. He intended, he said, to devote the rest of his life to learning the remaining twenty-two letters of the alphabet.

However, Benjamin and Clover could only be with Boxer after working hours, and it was in the middle of the day when the van came to take him away. The animals were all at work weeding turnips under the supervision of a pig, when they were astonished to see Benjamin come galloping from the direction of the farm buildings, braying at the top of his voice. It was the first time that they had ever seen Benjamin excited-indeed, it was the first time that anyone had ever seen him gallop. "Quick, quick!" he shouted. "Come at once! They're taking Boxer away!" Without waiting for orders from the pig, the animals broke off work and raced back to the farm buildings. Sure enough, there in the yard was a large closed van, drawn by two horses, with lettering on its side and a sly-looking man in a low-crowned bowler hat sitting on the driver's seat. And Boxer's stall was empty.

The animals crowded round the van. "Good-bye, Boxer!" they chorused, "good-bye!"

"Fools! Fools!" shouted Benjamin, prancing round them and stamping the earth with his small hoofs. "Fools! Do you not see what is written on the side of that van?"

That gave the animals pause, and there was a hush. Muriel began to spell out the words. But Benjamin pushed her aside and in the midst of a deadly silence he read:

"'Alfred Simmonds, Horse Slaughterer and Glue Boiler, Willingdon. Dealer in Hides and Bone-Meal. Kennels Supplied.' Do you not understand what that means? They are taking Boxer to the knacker's!"

A cry of horror burst from all the animals. At this moment the man on the box whipped up his horses and the van moved out of the yard at a smart trot. All the animals followed, crying out at the tops of their voices. Clover forced her way to the front. The van began to gather speed. Clover tried to stir her stout limbs to a gallop, and achieved a canter. "Boxer!" she cried. "Boxer! Boxer! Boxer!" And just at this moment, as though he had heard the uproar outside, Boxer's face, with the white stripe down his nose, appeared at the small window at the back of the van.

"Boxer!" cried Clover in a terrible voice. "Boxer! Get out! Get out quickly! They're taking you to your death!"

All the animals took up the cry of "Get out, Boxer, get out!" But the van was already gathering speed and drawing away from them. It was uncertain whether Boxer had understood what Clover had said. But a moment later his face disappeared from the window and there was the sound of a tremendous drumming of hoofs inside the van. He was trying to kick his way out. The time had been when a few kicks from Boxer's hoofs would have smashed the van to matchwood. But alas! his strength had left him; and in a few moments the sound of drumming hoofs grew fainter and died away. In desperation the animals began appealing to the two horses which drew the van to stop. "Comrades, comrades!" they shouted. "Don't take your own brother to his death!" But the stupid brutes, too ignorant to realise what was happening, merely set back their ears and quickened their pace. Boxer's face did not reappear at the window. Too late, someone thought of racing ahead and shutting the five-barred gate; but in another moment the van was through it and rapidly disappearing down the road. Boxer was never seen again.

Three days later it was announced that he had died in the hospital at Willingdon, in spite of receiving every attention a horse could have. Squealer came to announce the news to the others. He had, he said, been present during Boxer's last hours.

"It was the most affecting sight I have ever seen!" said Squealer, lifting his trotter and wiping away a tear. "I was at his bedside at the very last. And at the end, almost too weak to speak, he whispered in my ear that his sole sorrow was to have passed on before the windmill was finished. 'Forward, comrades!' he whispered. 'Forward in the name of the Rebellion. Long live Animal Farm! Long live Comrade Napoleon! Napoleon is always right.' Those were his very last words, comrades."

Here Squealer's demeanour suddenly changed. He fell silent for a moment, and his little eyes darted suspicious glances from side to side before he proceeded.

It had come to his knowledge, he said, that a foolish and wicked rumour had been circulated at the time of Boxer's removal. Some of the animals had noticed that the van which took Boxer away was marked "Horse Slaughterer," and had actually jumped to the conclusion that Boxer was being sent to the knacker's. It was almost unbelievable, said Squealer, that any animal could be so stupid. Surely, he cried indignantly, whisking his tail and skipping from side to side, surely they knew their beloved Leader, Comrade Napoleon, better than that? But the explanation was really very simple. The van had previously been the property of the knacker, and had been bought by the veterinary surgeon, who had not yet painted the old name out. That was how the mistake had arisen.

The animals were enormously relieved to hear this. And when Squealer went on to give further graphic details of Boxer's death-bed, the admirable care he had received, and the expensive medicines for which Napoleon had paid without a thought as to the cost, their last doubts disappeared and the sorrow that they felt for their comrade's death was tempered by the thought that at least he had died happy.

Napoleon himself appeared at the meeting on the following Sunday morning and pronounced a short oration in Boxer's honour. It had not been possible, he said, to bring back their lamented comrade's remains for interment on the farm, but he had ordered a large wreath to be made from the laurels in the farmhouse garden and sent down to be placed on Boxer's grave. And in a few days' time the pigs intended to hold a memorial banquet in Boxer's honour. Napoleon ended his speech with a reminder of Boxer's two favourite maxims, "I will work harder" and "Comrade Napoleon is always right", maxims, he said, which every animal would do well to adopt as his own.

On the day appointed for the banquet, a grocer's van drove up from Willingdon and delivered a large wooden crate at the farmhouse. That night there was the sound of uproarious singing, which was followed by what sounded like a violent quarrel and ended at about eleven o'clock with a tremendous crash of glass. No one stirred in the farmhouse before noon on the following day, and the word went round that from somewhere or other the pigs had acquired the money to buy themselves another case of whisky.





Chapter X


Years passed. The seasons came and went, the short animal lives fled by. A time came when there was no one who remembered the old days before the Rebellion, except Clover, Benjamin, Moses the raven, and a number of the pigs.

Muriel was dead; Bluebell, Jessie, and Pincher were dead. Jones too was dead—he had died in an inebriates' home in another part of the country. Snowball was forgotten. Boxer was forgotten, except by the few who had known him. Clover was an old stout mare now, stiff in the joints and with a tendency to rheumy eyes. She was two years past the retiring age, but in fact no animal had ever actually retired. The talk of setting aside a corner of the pasture for superannuated animals had long since been dropped. Napoleon was now a mature boar of twenty-four stone. Squealer was so fat that he could with difficulty see out of his eyes. Only old Benjamin was much the same as ever, except for being a little greyer about the muzzle, and, since Boxer's death, more morose and taciturn than ever.

There were many more creatures on the farm now, though the increase was not so great as had been expected in earlier years. Many animals had been born to whom the Rebellion was only a dim tradition, passed on by word of mouth, and others had been bought who had never heard mention of such a thing before their arrival. The farm possessed three horses now besides Clover. They were fine upstanding beasts, willing workers and good comrades, but very stupid. None of them proved able to learn the alphabet beyond the letter B. They accepted everything that they were told about the Rebellion and the principles of Animalism, especially from Clover, for whom they had an almost filial respect; but it was doubtful whether they understood very much of it. The farm was more prosperous now, and better organised: it had even been enlarged by two fields which had been bought from Mr. Pilkington. The windmill had been successfully completed at last, and the farm possessed a threshing machine and a hay elevator of its own, and various new buildings had been added to it. Whymper had bought himself a dogcart. The windmill, however, had not after all been used for generating electrical power. It was used for milling corn, and brought in a handsome money profit. The animals were hard at work building yet another windmill; when that one was finished, so it was said, the dynamos would be installed. But the luxuries of which Snowball had once taught the animals to dream, the stalls with electric light and hot and cold water, and the three-day week, were no longer talked about. Napoleon had denounced such ideas as contrary to the spirit of Animalism. The truest happiness, he said, lay in working hard and living frugally.

Somehow it seemed as though the farm had grown richer without making the animals themselves any richer, except, of course, for the pigs and the dogs. Perhaps this was partly because there were so many pigs and so many dogs. It was not that these creatures did not work, after their fashion. There was, as Squealer was never tired of explaining, endless work in the supervision and organisation of the farm. Much of this work was of a kind that the other animals were too ignorant to understand. For example, Squealer told them that the pigs had to expend enormous labours every day upon mysterious things called "files," "reports," "minutes," and "memoranda." These were large sheets of paper which had to be closely covered with writing, and as soon as they were so covered, they were burnt in the furnace. This was of the highest importance for the welfare of the farm, Squealer said. But still, neither pigs nor dogs produced any food by their own labour; and there were very many of them, and their appetites were always good.

As for the others, their life, so far as they knew, was as it had always been. They were generally hungry, they slept on straw, they drank from the pool, they laboured in the fields; in winter they were troubled by the cold, and in summer by the flies. Sometimes the older ones among them racked their dim memories and tried to determine whether in the early days of the Rebellion, when Jones's expulsion was still recent, things had been better or worse than now. They could not remember. There was nothing with which they could compare their present lives: they had nothing to go upon except Squealer's lists of figures, which invariably demonstrated that everything was getting better and better. The animals found the problem insoluble; in any case, they had little time for speculating on such things now. Only old Benjamin professed to remember every detail of his long life and to know that things never had been, nor ever could be much better or much worse-hunger, hardship, and disappointment being, so he said, the unalterable law of life.

And yet the animals never gave up hope. More, they never lost, even for an instant, their sense of honour and privilege in being members of Animal Farm. They were still the only farm in the whole county in all England—owned and operated by animals! Not one of them, not even the youngest, not even the newcomers who had been brought from farms ten or twenty miles away, ever ceased to marvel at that. And when they heard the gun booming and saw the green flag fluttering at the masthead, their hearts swelled with imperishable pride, and the talk turned always towards the old heroic days, the expulsion of Jones, the writing of the Seven Commandments, the great battles in which the human invaders had been defeated. None of the old dreams had been abandoned. The Republic of the Animals which Major had foretold, when the green fields of England should be untrodden by human feet, was still believed in. Some day it was coming: it might not be soon, it might not be with in the lifetime of any animal now living, but still it was coming. Even the tune of Beasts of England was perhaps hummed secretly here and there: at any rate, it was a fact that every animal on the farm knew it, though no one would have dared to sing it aloud. It might be that their lives were hard and that not all of their hopes had been fulfilled; but they were conscious that they were not as other animals. If they went hungry, it was not from feeding tyrannical human beings; if they worked hard, at least they worked for themselves. No creature among them went upon two legs. No creature called any other creature "Master." All animals were equal.

One day in early summer Squealer ordered the sheep to follow him, and led them out to a piece of waste ground at the other end of the farm, which had become overgrown with birch saplings. The sheep spent the whole day there browsing at the leaves under Squealer's supervision. In the evening he returned to the farmhouse himself, but, as it was warm weather, told the sheep to stay where they were. It ended by their remaining there for a whole week, during which time the other animals saw nothing of them. Squealer was with them for the greater part of every day. He was, he said, teaching them to sing a new song, for which privacy was needed.

It was just after the sheep had returned, on a pleasant evening when the animals had finished work and were making their way back to the farm buildings, that the terrified neighing of a horse sounded from the yard. Startled, the animals stopped in their tracks. It was Clover's voice. She neighed again, and all the animals broke into a gallop and rushed into the yard. Then they saw what Clover had seen.

It was a pig walking on his hind legs.

Yes, it was Squealer. A little awkwardly, as though not quite used to supporting his considerable bulk in that position, but with perfect balance, he was strolling across the yard. And a moment later, out from the door of the farmhouse came a long file of pigs, all walking on their hind legs. Some did it better than others, one or two were even a trifle unsteady and looked as though they would have liked the support of a stick, but every one of them made his way right round the yard successfully. And finally there was a tremendous baying of dogs and a shrill crowing from the black cockerel, and out came Napoleon himself, majestically upright, casting haughty glances from side to side, and with his dogs gambolling round him.

He carried a whip in his trotter.

There was a deadly silence. Amazed, terrified, huddling together, the animals watched the long line of pigs march slowly round the yard. It was as though the world had turned upside-down. Then there came a moment when the first shock had worn off and when, in spite of everything—in spite of their terror of the dogs, and of the habit, developed through long years, of never complaining, never criticising, no matter what happened—they might have uttered some word of protest. But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of—

"Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!"

It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse.

Benjamin felt a nose nuzzling at his shoulder. He looked round. It was Clover. Her old eyes looked dimmer than ever. Without saying anything, she tugged gently at his mane and led him round to the end of the big barn, where the Seven Commandments were written. For a minute or two they stood gazing at the tatted wall with its white lettering.

"My sight is failing," she said finally. "Even when I was young I could not have read what was written there. But it appears to me that that wall looks different. Are the Seven Commandments the same as they used to be, Benjamin?"

For once Benjamin consented to break his rule, and he read out to her what was written on the wall. There was nothing there now except a single Commandment. It ran:





All animals are equal

But some animals are more equal than others





After that it did not seem strange when next day the pigs who were supervising the work of the farm all carried whips in their trotters. It did not seem strange to learn that the pigs had bought themselves a wireless set, were arranging to install a telephone, and had taken out subscriptions to John Bull, TitBits, and the Daily Mirror. It did not seem strange when Napoleon was seen strolling in the farmhouse garden with a pipe in his mouth, no, not even when the pigs took Mr. Jones's clothes out of the wardrobes and put them on, Napoleon himself appearing in a black coat, ratcatcher breeches, and leather leggings, while his favourite sow appeared in the watered silk dress which Mrs. Jones had been used to wear on Sundays.

A week later, in the afternoon, a number of dogcarts drove up to the farm. A deputation of neighbouring farmers had been invited to make a tour of inspection. They were shown all over the farm, and expressed great admiration for everything they saw, especially the windmill. The animals were weeding the turnip field. They worked diligently hardly raising their faces from the ground, and not knowing whether to be more frightened of the pigs or of the human visitors.

That evening loud laughter and bursts of singing came from the farmhouse. And suddenly, at the sound of the mingled voices, the animals were stricken with curiosity. What could be happening in there, now that for the first time animals and human beings were meeting on terms of equality? With one accord they began to creep as quietly as possible into the farmhouse garden.

At the gate they paused, half frightened to go on but Clover led the way in. They tiptoed up to the house, and such animals as were tall enough peered in at the dining-room window. There, round the long table, sat half a dozen farmers and half a dozen of the more eminent pigs, Napoleon himself occupying the seat of honour at the head of the table. The pigs appeared completely at ease in their chairs. The company had been enjoying a game of cards but had broken off for the moment, evidently in order to drink a toast. A large jug was circulating, and the mugs were being refilled with beer. No one noticed the wondering faces of the animals that gazed in at the window.

Mr. Pilkington, of Foxwood, had stood up, his mug in his hand. In a moment, he said, he would ask the present company to drink a toast. But before doing so, there were a few words that he felt it incumbent upon him to say.

It was a source of great satisfaction to him, he said—and, he was sure, to all others present—to feel that a long period of mistrust and misunderstanding had now come to an end. There had been a time, not that he, or any of the present company, had shared such sentiments, but there had been a time when the respected proprietors of Animal Farm had been regarded, he would not say with hostility, but perhaps with a certain measure of misgiving, by their human neighbours. Unfortunate incidents had occurred, mistaken ideas had been current. It had been felt that the existence of a farm owned and operated by pigs was somehow abnormal and was liable to have an unsettling effect in the neighbourhood. Too many farmers had assumed, without due enquiry, that on such a farm a spirit of licence and indiscipline would prevail. They had been nervous about the effects upon their own animals, or even upon their human employees. But all such doubts were now dispelled. Today he and his friends had visited Animal Farm and inspected every inch of it with their own eyes, and what did they find? Not only the most up-to-date methods, but a discipline and an orderliness which should be an example to all farmers everywhere. He believed that he was right in saying that the lower animals on Animal Farm did more work and received less food than any animals in the county. Indeed, he and his fellow-visitors today had observed many features which they intended to introduce on their own farms immediately.

He would end his remarks, he said, by emphasising once again the friendly feelings that subsisted, and ought to subsist, between Animal Farm and its neighbours. Between pigs and human beings there was not, and there need not be, any clash of interests whatever. Their struggles and their difficulties were one. Was not the labour problem the same everywhere? Here it became apparent that Mr. Pilkington was about to spring some carefully prepared witticism on the company, but for a moment he was too overcome by amusement to be able to utter it. After much choking, during which his various chins turned purple, he managed to get it out: "If you have your lower animals to contend with," he said, "we have our lower classes!" This bon mot set the table in a roar; and Mr. Pilkington once again congratulated the pigs on the low rations, the long working hours, and the general absence of pampering which he had observed on Animal Farm.

And now, he said finally, he would ask the company to rise to their feet and make certain that their glasses were full. "Gentlemen," concluded Mr. Pilkington, "gentlemen, I give you a toast: To the prosperity of Animal Farm!"

There was enthusiastic cheering and stamping of feet. Napoleon was so gratified that he left his place and came round the table to clink his mug against Mr. Pilkington's before emptying it. When the cheering had died down, Napoleon, who had remained on his feet, intimated that he too had a few words to say.

Like all of Napoleon's speeches, it was short and to the point. He too, he said, was happy that the period of misunderstanding was at an end. For a long time there had been rumours-circulated, he had reason to think, by some malignant enemy—that there was something subversive and even revolutionary in the outlook of himself and his colleagues. They had been credited with attempting to stir up rebellion among the animals on neighbouring farms. Nothing could be further from the truth! Their sole wish, now and in the past, was to live at peace and in normal business relations with their neighbours. This farm which he had the honour to control, he added, was a co-operative enterprise. The title-deeds, which were in his own possession, were owned by the pigs jointly.

He did not believe, he said, that any of the old suspicions still lingered, but certain changes had been made recently in the routine of the farm which should have the effect of promoting confidence stiff further. Hitherto the animals on the farm had had a rather foolish custom of addressing one another as "Comrade." This was to be suppressed. There had also been a very strange custom, whose origin was unknown, of marching every Sunday morning past a boar's skull which was nailed to a post in the garden. This, too, would be suppressed, and the skull had already been buried. His visitors might have observed, too, the green flag which flew from the masthead. If so, they would perhaps have noted that the white hoof and horn with which it had previously been marked had now been removed. It would be a plain green flag from now onwards.

He had only one criticism, he said, to make of Mr. Pilkington's excellent and neighbourly speech. Mr. Pilkington had referred throughout to "Animal Farm". He could not of course know, for he, Napoleon, was only now for the first time announcing it, that the name "Animal Farm" had been abolished. Henceforward the farm was to be known as "The Manor Farm" —which, he believed, was its correct and original name.

"Gentlemen," concluded Napoleon, "I will give you the same toast as before, but in a different form. Fill your glasses to the brim. Gentlemen, here is my toast: To the prosperity of The Manor Farm!"

There was the same hearty cheering as before, and the mugs were emptied to the dregs. But as the animals outside gazed at the scene, it seemed to them that some strange thing was happening. What was it that had altered in the faces of the pigs? Clover's old dim eyes flitted from one face to another. Some of them had five chins, some had four, some had three. But what was it that seemed to be melting and changing? Then, the applause having come to an end, the company took up their cards and continued the game that had been interrupted, and the animals crept silently away.

But they had not gone twenty yards when they stopped short. An uproar of voices was coming from the farmhouse. They rushed back and looked through the window again. Yes, a violent quarrel was in progress. There were shoutings, bangings on the table, sharp suspicious glances, furious denials. The source of the trouble appeared to be that Napoleon and Mr. Pilkington had each played an ace of spades simultaneously.

Twelve voices were shouting in anger, and they were all alike. No question, now, what had happened to the faces of the pigs. The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which.





THE END
