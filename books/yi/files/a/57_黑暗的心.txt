第一章


巡航小帆船奈莉号的帆并未抖动，便抛下了锚，稳稳停好。潮涨了，风也几乎止住，她要往下游开去，只能静等退潮。

泰晤士河的入海口在我们面前铺展开，像一个起点，通向一条漫无尽头的航道。远远望去，海天交融，浑然一体。从那片明亮之处，随潮飘来艘艘大帆船，那些久晒成棕褐色的帆，仿佛寂然不动，红红地堆起来，帆顶尖尖的，斜杠上明灭着清漆的幽光。烟迷的河岸低低地延伸开去，渐渐消失不见。格雷夫森德[1]上空，天色黯然，再往深处更是仿佛凝成一片愁云惨雾，死寂地摧压在世上最大，亦最伟大的城市之上[2]。

公司的主任是我们的船长兼东家。他站在船头向海远望时，我们四人热切地盯着他的背影。在整条河流上，唯这一幕最富于航海色彩。他像引航员，水手的依靠。然而他的工作竟不在那个明亮的河湾上，而在他身后那片压得人喘不过气的阴云之下。

在我们之间，我之前也说过，有着海洋的纽带。除了在漫长的别离中，让我们彼此牵挂，它还有一种奇效，令我们足以忍受彼此信口说出的奇闻逸事，甚至是荒诞离奇的信念。那位律师——最讨人喜欢的长者——因为资历深厚和德高望重，占用了船上唯一一个靠垫，并躺在唯一一条小毯子上。会计之前拿了一盒多米诺骨牌出来，正在拿牌搭房子。马洛盘腿坐在船尾，背倚着后桅。他双颊深陷，面色蜡黄，腰身挺拔，像个苦行僧。他双臂下垂，双掌外翻，又像尊神像。主任见锚抓稳了，便放了心，走到船尾，在我们中间坐下。大家只懒洋洋地说了几句话，然后船上一片沉静。不知怎的我们没有玩起多米诺骨牌来。我们仿佛满腔心事，对什么都无情无绪，只管睁着眼睛出神。夜幕徐徐降临，安宁静谧，晚霞烂漫。水面泛起粼粼波光，柔静细碎，天空了无纤尘，温和辽阔，澄净生光。埃塞克斯沼泽地上那片薄雾，像流彩溢辉的轻纱，从内陆高地的树林上垂下，柔柔地笼罩住低处的河岸，清透的褶皱隐隐飘拂。只有西方那片摧压着上游的阴云，在一分一秒地益发阴沉下去，仿佛因为落日的步步逼近赫然而怒。

终于，太阳沿着弧线悄然沉没，从灿白变成滞红，光消热散，像突然熄灭一般，撞死在那片芸芸众生头顶上的阴云里。

水上风光顿改。褪去光辉的静谧变得更为深沉。夜幕降临之时，这条古老的河流安然地置身于它宽阔的河道里。千百年来，它惠及了居于两岸的种族，而现在，它顺着这一条通往天涯海角的水道，从容而庄严地，柔柔舒展着身躯。在我们眼中，这是一条令人肃然起敬的河流，照亮它的并不是朝生暮死的浮丽日光，而是庄严的记忆之光，历经世世代代，永不磨灭。事实上，对于一个俗语里心怀敬畏和爱慕“漂洋而生”[3]的人来说，途经泰晤士河下游，最能触发过往的万丈豪情。潮汐日日复年年地来来去去，载着回家安歇或者出海战斗的人和船进进出出，堆积起层层叠叠的记忆。这个国家引以为傲的人物，它无一不认识并接待过，从弗朗西斯·德雷克[4]先生到约翰·富兰克林[5]先生，所有了不起的骑士——所有那些海上的英雄好汉，不论是否拥有真正的骑士头衔。它接送过每一艘名声远扬的船只，它们的名字耀若珠宝，在时间长河的黑夜里熠熠生辉。从那一艘双侧船舱满载财宝归来，引得女皇殿下亲临迎接，荣冠一时的金鹿号[6]，到外出征讨其他地方却一别茫茫的埃里布斯号与恐怖号。它都在场，亲眼见证。人和船从德特福特、格林尼治和埃利斯出发——冒险者和殖民者，皇家帆船和商人的商船，船长、海军将领、暗地里从东方贸易分羹的“走私犯”，还有东印度舰队雇佣的“将军”。追名逐利之徒都从那条河流出发，利剑随身，也常常携带火炬。他们是该国强权的使者，手握神圣之火的火种。天下闻名的一切，都曾经随着这条河流的退潮漂浮出海，流去某片未知陆地的神秘之中……人类的梦想，共和国的种子，帝国的幼芽。

日落了，河面上天色渐暗，岸边亮起星星灯火。三条腿的查普曼灯塔矗立在海滨泥地上，发着强光。船的灯火流过河道——许许多多的灯光，热热闹闹地沿着河道上上下下。西边的上游处，坐落着那个大得畸形的城市，那不祥的标记仍在上空盘桓不去——残阳里的阴霾，群星下的鬼火。

“而这个地方，”马洛突然说，“也一直是世界上最黑暗的地方之一。”

他是我们之中唯一一个仍然“漂洋而生”的人。若要指责他，最多也只能说他没有代表自己的阶级。他是一个海员，却也是一个流浪者。然而几乎所有海员的生活，如果可以这样说的话，都有点安土重迁。他们满脑子都是居家的知识，去哪里都带着自己的家——船。他们也总是走不出自己的国家——海洋。船和船之间差异不大，海洋则处处相同。在千篇一律的环境中，异国的海岸，陌生的脸孔，截然不同的生活，浮光掠影般流转着，相隔的不是一层神秘的面纱，却是带着淡淡轻侮的蒙昧，因为对海员而言，唯有海洋本身是神秘的，它主宰他们的存在，和命运之神一般喜怒无常。而大陆的所有秘密，等辛劳的工作结束后，上岸闲逛一回，或肆意狂欢一番，便一览无遗，但一般他们对那些秘密兴味索然。海员随口说出来的奇闻逸事有着一种简单粗暴的直率，其中含义一目了然，仿佛碎果壳里无处藏身的果仁。然而听说马洛是个例外（如果不提他胡诌杜撰的癖好）。对他而言，事件的意义并非像果仁藏在壳内一样，隐潜于字里行间，而是像灼热的光生出来的烟雾，披裹在外，犹如朦胧的月晕，有时候正是仰仗了森冷的月光才得以显现。

大家似乎对他说的话全然不觉得惊讶。马洛平时就这么说话。大家报以沉默，甚至都懒得发牢骚。他马上接着说下去，慢条斯理地——

“我想起那个古远的时代，罗马人初次踏上这片土地，一千九百年前——好像还只是几天前的事……这条河的明光可以追溯到——你说那些骑士？倒也不错。但这道光像火光蹿过平原，像闪电掠过乌云。我们就活在那忽明忽灭的光明之中——但愿只要老旧的地球还转得动，它就别彻底熄掉！但这里昨天是黑暗的。试想一下那种感觉，一个船长正指挥着一艘漂亮体面的——叫什么名字来着？——地中海三桨战船，却突然被调往北方，不得不匆匆忙忙地穿越高卢地区去指挥这些罗马军团的小船——军团的士兵也一定是些能工巧匠，这些小船他们几个月就能造出成百上千艘来，如果书本没有骗人。想象一下，假如那船长来到这个鬼地方——世界的尽头，海洋是铅灰的，天空是烟黑的，船差不多和六角手风琴一样不听使唤——指挥小船沿着这条河驶往上游，船上装满了军需品，或者订购的货物，或者随便你们高兴说的什么。沙岸、沼泽、森林、土人——对一个文明人来说，能吃的太少太珍贵，能喝的也只有泰晤士河的河水。这里没有法洛尼恩葡萄酒[7]，上岸也没有。军营孤零零地散落在荒野中偶尔可见，就像针掉在干草堆里一样——冷啊，雾啊，狂风暴雨啊，疾病啊，流亡啊，还有死亡——死神就潜伏在空气里、水里和丛林里。他们肯定像苍蝇一样死在这里。噢，是的——那船长活下来了，毫无疑问还大捞了一笔，当然其实他也没太拿这当回事儿，也许不过就是过后向人吹嘘吹嘘当年他有多么英勇。他们可都是浑身是胆的好汉，面对那片黑暗时毫不怯场。而也许正是因为他一心想着升职，认为只要在罗马有靠得住的好兄弟，并能够熬过这该死的气候，有朝一日总能被调到拉文纳[8]去指挥舰队，才能一直那么兴冲冲的。又或者，你们想象一下一个体面的年轻市民，穿着古罗马的托加袍——大概是赌骰子输得够呛——跟着某个市长、税务员或者甚至是生意人跑出来做发财梦。在某片沼泽地上岸，用两条腿穿过森林，走到某个内地的驿站时，突然发现身边是一片凶残的荒凉，凶残得毫无商量，把他围得密不透风——所有那些谜一样的生活，充满了在森林里、丛林里和土人心里蠢蠢欲动的野性。这些谜团无法破解，他只能一直活在这不可理喻而又可恶至极的环境之中。然而这环境也有一种令他着迷的魔力，憎恶的魔力——想想那不断增长的悔恨，那逃走的渴望，那令人彻骨地疲倦的厌恶，那自暴自弃和那怨毒。”

他暂时闭上了口。

“不过要注意，”他又开始道，弯起一条手臂，外翻手掌，加上在身前盘着的双腿，他的姿势像个正在布道的佛像，只不过穿的是欧式衣服，身下也没有莲花座——“要注意，我们现在谁也无法准确地对此感同身受了。多亏了效率——对效率的虔诚追求。不过这些家伙也算不上是什么大人物，真的。他们算不上是殖民者，他们的所谓行政只不过是去压榨当地人，我怀疑。他们是征服者，需要的只是残忍的武力——拥有这种力量没什么好夸耀的，别人只是意外地比他们弱小罢了。他们为达目的，从不放过能抢走的一切。这不过是肆无忌惮的暴力抢劫，罪加一等的大肆屠杀，他们却疯了一样前仆后继——要对付黑暗，倒也合该如此。征服土地，大多数情况下意味着抢走它，从那些肤色与我们不同，或者是鼻梁比我们稍稍塌一点的人那里。要是刨根问底，就会发现这不够光彩。能给它挽回一点面子的，就只有这样一个信念，隐藏在征服背后的，不是虚伪的感情，而是一个信念，以及对这个信念毫无私心的信仰——可以供奉起来，对它鞠躬，献上牺牲品的……”

他打住了。河上流转着团团小小的火焰，绿色的，红色的，白色的，你追我赶，争先恐后，分分合合，交相穿越——然后或快或慢地分道扬镳。在无眠的河流上，夜色越益沉暗，那巨城的交通夜以继日。我们静观其变——潮水涨停之前我们无事可做。沉默了许久之后，他用迟疑的声音说：“你们这些家伙应该还记得吧？我的确曾经干过一阵子内河水手。”这下好了，在开始退潮之前，马洛又要讲一段他那些不了了之的经历，想不听都不行。

“我不想给你们唠叨我那些老掉牙的个人经历，”他说，他属于那一类往往不知道听众最想听什么的人，这句话正好暴露出这类人的弱点，“然而，要理解它对我产生的影响，你们得先知道我是怎样跑到了那儿去，看见了什么，怎样沿河而上去到那个地方，初次见到了那个可怜的家伙。那是航海的尽头，也是我这辈子经历的最高潮。不知怎的，它好像点亮了我身边的一切——也点亮了我的思想。它很令人哀伤——也很悲惨——怎么看也很普通——也不明不白。就是不明不白的。然而它似乎给了我一点启发。”

“你们应该还记得，那时我刚回到伦敦，在跑了很多趟印度洋、太平洋和中国海之后——那是东方的常规航线——这条航线我跑了有六年左右。回到伦敦后，我无所事事，在你们的上班时间去打搅你们工作，上你们家去找麻烦，仿佛我身负神圣的使命，要去教化你们。刚开始很开心，但不久我就感觉闲得烦透了。然后我开始去找一艘船——我想尝试一下地球上最艰苦的工作。但没人理我。我对这个游戏也烦透了。”

“我小时候可喜欢看地图了。我会一连好几个小时盯着南美洲、非洲或者澳洲出神，为那些辉煌光荣的探险伟业心荡神驰。那时地图上有很多空白的空间，每当我看见一处看起来特别诱人的地方（但它们看起来都这样），就会把手指放在上面，说长大后一定要去那里。北极就是其中之一，我记得，不过我还没去过北极，也不打算去了。它的魔力已经消失了。其他空白空间散布在赤道周围和东西半球的各个纬度上。我去过其中一些地方，然后——唔，别谈这个了。但还有一个地方——可以说是最大最空的——我还渴望去看看。”

“确实，它现在已经不再空白。从我小时候起，它就渐渐被填上河流、湖泊和地名。它不再是一块谜样的空白，充满乐趣——一块可以让男孩梦想光荣的空白。它变得一片黑暗。但那里有一条很特别的河，一条巨大的河，你可以在地图上看到它，就像一条硕大无朋的蛇，头淹在海里，身子一动不动地蜷曲着，穿过一片广袤的土地，尾巴消失在内陆深处。当我透过商店的橱窗，看着它的地图时，被深深迷住了，像一只被蛇迷住的鸟——蠢得要命的小鸟。然后我想起来，那条河上有一家大公司，大贸易公司。老天！我暗暗地想，要在那么大一条河上做生意，他们总要用到船吧——他们肯定有汽船！我干吗不试试去应聘船长？我沿着舰队街[9]走啊走，但这个念头一直缠着我。那条蛇弄得我五迷三道的。”

“要知道那是一家欧洲大陆的公司，那个贸易公司。我倒是有很多亲戚住在大陆上，他们说因为那里生活成本低，也不像看起来那么糟糕。”

“我厚颜无耻地去托他们替我打点。对我而言，这完全是一条新的人生道路。我不习惯这一套。我总是用自己的腿，走自己的路，去自己想去的地方。过后我都无法相信自己变成了那样，但是，那会儿——你们瞧——我真是鬼迷心窍，觉得反正我就是要达到目的，不择手段也在所不惜。于是我去托他们替我打点。男人们说完‘我亲爱的老朋友’便全无下文。然后——真难为情——我尝试向女士们下手。我，查利·马洛，打发女人们去替我跑腿——帮我找一份差事。天啊！要怪就怪那个念头。我有一个姨妈，一个可亲的热心人。她给我写信说：‘定然是一件令人愉悦的工作。我必定竭尽所能助你成功。该想法极佳。我认识一位公司高官的太太，和另一位有头面的先生……’等等。她下定决心，不畏艰难，一定要帮我当上内河船长，让我得偿所愿。”

“我得到了那份工作——那是当然的，但比想象中快得多。听说这家公司收到消息，说他们有个船长在和当地人的一场混战中一命呜呼了。真是千载难逢的好机会，这样一来我更加迫不及待要去接替他了。很多个月后，我试图去取回那个船长的尸体，才听说他和当地人嚷嚷起来的原因，是由几只母鸡引发的一场误会。没错，是两只黑母鸡。弗雷斯勒文——那个家伙的名字，一个丹麦人——认为自己在这笔买卖中上当受骗吃了亏，所以冲上岸，抄起一根棍子痛打那个村长。唔，尽管有同事告诉我，弗雷斯勒文是用两条腿行走的生物中最温和沉静的一个，我对这个故事也并不感到丝毫惊讶。他肯定是那样的人。但他已经在外为这崇高的事业打拼了好几年，可能终于感到有必要向别人证明一下他也是有自尊心的，于是他残忍地痛打那个老黑人，当着一大群村民的面，把他们吓得大气不敢出，直到某个男子汉——听说是村长的儿子——听到那个老家伙喊得撕心裂肺的，实在忍无可忍，拿起长矛向那白人试探性地一刺——一下子就刺进了两片肩胛骨之间。全村人马上逃进森林，等着大祸降临，然而，另一方面，本来听命于弗雷斯勒文的汽船慌慌张张地离开了，我相信是轮机手指挥的。过后似乎没有人为弗雷斯勒文的遗体操心，直到我被派去接替他的职位。尽管我不能置之不理，但等到我终于有机会与我的前任相见的时候，从他肋骨之间长出的荒草已经高得足以淹没他的骸骨了。倒也齐全。这一个超自然的人物倒下后，完全没被碰过。村子已经荒废了，那些茅屋张大了黑洞洞的嘴巴，腐烂着，在倒塌了的围栏内东倒西歪。这里肯定横遭了灾劫。村民都消失了。大难当前，疯狂的恐怖情绪在村民之间迅速传播，他们四散狂奔，男人，女人，还有儿童，全都跑进灌木丛中，一去不回。我也不知道后来那些母鸡怎么样了，但说它们为进步事业献了身总还是可以的。然而，多亏了这一桩光荣的事件，我被任命为船长。那时我都还没来得及对得到这个职位心生希望呢。”

“我发了疯似的东奔西走，准备赴任，不到四十八小时就已经穿越英吉利海峡，见到我的雇主，签订好合同。不过短短几个小时，我便到了一个城市，那个城市总是让我想起一个精心粉刷过的巨大坟墓。那当然是一种偏见。我毫不费力就找到了公司的办公地点。它是这座城市的老大，我所遇到的每一个人都和它纠缠不清。他们正盘算着要营建一个海外帝国，通过贸易赚取源源不断的利润。”

“我来到一条阴黑的街道上，狭窄荒凉，房屋都高高的，有无数带百叶窗的窗户，一片死寂，小草从石头之间探出头来，两边都是气派的马车拱道，巨大而沉重的双扇门阴森地半开着。我找到一条门缝溜进去，走上一道打扫得干干净净的楼梯，那楼梯很简陋，像沙漠一样了无生气。我推开碰上的第一扇门，看见两位女士，一胖一瘦，正坐在垫了草垫的扶手椅里织黑毛线。瘦的那个站起来，径直向我走过来——仍然低头织着毛线——她好像是个梦游者，我正想着给她让道，她却站住了，抬起头来看看我。她的衣服平整得像个伞套。她默默转身，把我带进一个候见室。我报上姓名，在房间里东张西望。中央有一张松木桌，墙根散放着普通的椅子，房间一头挂着一张巨大的地图，闪闪发光，上面用彩虹的七色做了密密麻麻的标记。有很多标记成红色的地方——红色任何时候看起来都赏心悦目，因为那意味着实实在在的工作成果。蓝色的地方也非常多，还有一小片绿色，几点橙色，在东海岸则有一小块紫色，表示那些兴高采烈的进步先锋们正在那里大喝令人兴高采烈的拉格啤酒[10]。然而，这些地方我都不想去。我要去标记成黄色的地方，地图的正中央。那条河正好在那儿——勾魂摄魄——阴森狰狞——像一条蛇。啊！门开了，秘书的脑袋露出来，满头白发，一副悲天悯人的表情。他用瘦骨嶙峋的食指把我招呼到密室里去。密室里黑灯瞎火的，中间摆着一张沉重的写字台。我渐渐看清楚写字台后面的人影，白白胖胖，穿着双排扣长礼服。他就是老大。我看他大概五尺六寸高，动动手指头就能调用成百上千万英镑。他和我握手，大概是对我的法语很满意吧，口齿不清地说了句：一路顺风[11]。”

“大约四十五秒后，我又回到了候见室，和那个悲天悯人的秘书待在一起。那个人满怀伤感和同情地让我签了一份文件。我相信自己肯定做出了很多保证，包括不能泄露任何贸易秘密。我本来也没想过要那样做的嘛。”

“我开始感到有些不对劲儿。你们也知道我对这些官方程序很不习惯，而且那种气氛让人觉得不吉利，就好像我被卷入某个阴谋里似的——我也说不清——反正就不是什么好事。从那个房间出来，我觉得轻松多了。那两个女人还在外间紧张地埋头织着黑毛线。不断有人进来，那个年轻一些的走来走去给他们引路。年纪大的那个坐在椅子上。她把平底布拖鞋抵在一个脚炉上，膝上躺着一只猫。她头上包着一块浆过的白布，也看不出是什么材料的，一边脸上有颗疣子，一副银边眼镜架在鼻尖上。她从眼镜上方迅速扫了我一眼，漠然得好像我是空气似的，真没礼貌。又走过去两个年轻人，看起来蠢得要命，却又一脸喜相，她也同样那么冷漠地看了他们一眼，好像她是个很有智慧的人似的。她似乎洞悉我们的一切。我不寒而栗。她仿佛有一种操控命运的神秘力量。在我远赴他乡的时候，常常想起这两个女人，镇守着黑暗的大门，用黑羊毛织着温暖的裹尸布，一个负责带路，不断把人带到没有人认识的地方，另一个瞪着那双冷漠森然的老眼来检查那些愉快而愚蠢的脸蛋。万福！[12]织黑毛线的老人家。即将赴死的将士向您致敬。[13]领教过她这种目光的人，没几个能再见到她——不到一半，远远不到。”

“还要去找医生。‘例行手续而已。’秘书向我保证，好让我放心，好像对于我所有的疑虑，他完全了解，而且深表同情。于是一个歪戴着帽子盖住左眼眉的年轻伙计，大概是个文书吧——公司里肯定有文书，尽管这座房子就跟建在了坟墓里似的，死气沉沉——从楼上某个地方走下来带我去找医生。他穿得又破又旧，一点儿也不讲究。外套袖子上沾着墨水迹，皱巴巴的围巾松垮垮地围在脖子上，下巴像旧靴子的鞋尖一样。时间还早，我提议去喝一杯，他马上喜笑颜开。我们点了苦艾酒[14]，他边喝边把公司的生意吹得天上有地下无，我随口表示好奇，问他为什么不自己出去闯闯。他马上变得又冷淡又严肃。‘借用柏拉图对他门徒说的话，我没看起来那么笨。’他简短地说，好像很壮烈地干了他的酒。我们站起身来。”

“那位老医生给我诊脉时，明显有些心不在焉。‘好，去那儿没问题。’他嘟嘟囔囔地说，然后热切地问我愿不愿意让他量一量我的头。我有些惊讶地说可以，他就拿出一个像卡尺一样的工具，从所有角度把我的头骨量了一遍，仔细地记录下来。他是个小个子，胡子拉碴的，穿着一件很旧的外套，像是工作服，踩着拖鞋，我觉得他是一个对人无害的笨蛋。‘为了科学的发展，凡是要到那里去的人，我都求他们让我量量头盖骨。’他说。‘等他们回来了，您会再量一遍吗？’我问。‘哦，我没见过他们回来，’他说，‘再说了，变化是内在的，对不对？’他笑了，好像自己讲了个隐晦的笑话。‘所以你是要到那里去了。真了不起。有趣极了。’他用锐利的目光扫了我一眼，又记下一条笔记。‘你的家族有精神病史吗？’他用就事论事的语气问道。我气炸了。‘这也是为了科学的发展吗？’‘在科学上，’他说，并没有注意到我有多么生气，‘当场密切关注个人精神状态的变化是很有意义的，但是……’‘您是个精神病学家吗？’我打断他。‘应该每个医生都——多少懂一点儿吧。’那个怪人若无其事地说，‘我有这么一个小观点，麻烦你们这些到那里去的先生们务必帮我证实一下。我们国家有那么多属地，想要什么有什么，我这要求也不算过分。这是我唯一能留给他人的财富。请不要为我的问题生气，但你是我检查的第一个英国人……’我忙告诉他我可一点儿也不具有代表性。‘要是我有，’我说，‘就不会这么没礼貌。’‘你这话够深奥的，不过事实也许并非如此。’他大笑着说，‘避免暴怒，比避免暴晒更重要。慢走。[15]你们英国人是怎么说的来着？再会。啊！再会。慢走。[16]在热带地区，不管遇到什么事情，都要记住保持冷静……’他举起一根食指，以示警告……‘冷静，冷静。慢走。’[17]”

“还要去做一件事情——向我那杰出的姨妈告辞。她见到我，欣喜若狂。我喝了杯茶——之后无数天我都喝不上这么像样的茶了——在一个最最舒服的房间里，那可是贵妇的会客室，你们能想象得出有多舒服它就有多舒服。我们在火炉旁安安静静地聊了很久很久。这时我才知道，她把我推荐给那位高官的夫人，还有天晓得其他多少人，说我天赋非凡——对公司来说简直是天降奇福——是百年不遇的人才。天啊！我不过是要去指挥一条不值几个钱的内河汽船，它的汽笛几乎不要钱！然而，那表明我也是一个名副其实的‘工作人员’，也算是光明的使者，低级传教士。当时书报上和言谈里满是这种蠢话，而那位杰出的女士正好生活在那阵鬼话的浪潮之中，被冲得晕头转向，快连自己是谁都不知道了。她大谈‘帮助那数百万无知的土人戒除陋习’，说个不停，我都要听不下去了。我壮起胆来，暗示说公司就是想赚钱而已。”

“‘我亲爱的查理，你忘了，他们也是通过付出劳动赚取钱财的。’她说，好像很聪明伶俐似的。真是奇怪，女人怎么会这么天真！她们活在自己的世界里，这样的世界从前没有，以后也不会有。它太美好了，就算她们真的建起了这么一个世界，它也熬不过第一个日落。我们男人从创世之日起便坦然对待的某个混账事实，会蹦出来打碎它。”

“完了她拥抱我，嘱咐我要穿上法兰绒上衣，记得常常来信，等等——之后我就走了。在大街上——不知怎的——可奇怪了，我忽然觉得自己是个大骗子。太奇怪了，我这个人向来是接到通知之后二十四小时内就能出发去任何地方的，就跟大多数人过马路一样，不需要思前想后，但有那么一瞬间——面对这么一件区区小事，虽说不上是犹豫不决，我却有点临阵退缩。这么解释最好了：有那么几秒钟，我觉得我要去的是地球的中心，而不是大陆的中心。”

“我坐一艘法国轮船离开，她经停每一个属于公司的混账港口，据我了解就只是为了送士兵和海关官员上岸。我一路盯着海岸看。看着海岸滑过轮船，就像在猜谜。它就在眼前——笑着，皱着眉，欢迎着，宏伟，残忍，无聊，或野蛮，好像一路在无声地对人轻轻说着：来看看我葫芦里卖的是什么药！这片海岸平淡无奇，好像还没修好似的，只是一味的阴森凄凉。那一大片丛林的边缘绿得发黑，镶着白色的海浪，仿佛用尺子画出来的白线，笔直地沿着一片蓝色的海洋延伸开去，薄雾慢慢升上来，遮住海水的闪光。烈日炎炎，陆地仿佛也在放光，冒着水汽，湿淋淋的。白浪里不时冒出一些灰白的斑点，有些顶上飘着旗。是居民点——这些有着几百年历史的居民点，在那片未被开发的辽阔背景下，不过像针尖一般渺小。我们乘风破浪，靠岸，丢下几个士兵；继续前进，在关税站丢下几个海关职员——那些关税站就是些用马口铁做的棚子，支着旗杆，隐没在一片仿佛被上帝遗弃了的荒野中；再丢下几个士兵——大概是要他们去保护那些海关职员吧。听说有些士兵掉到海里淹死了，但似乎没人在意。把他们送到目的地就完事了，我们继续前进。海岸每天看起来都一模一样，我们仿佛在原地打转，但实际上我们已经驶过了许多地方——贸易点——叫什么大巴萨姆啊、小波波啊之类的，这些名字让人想到那些在狰狞的幕布前演出的下流闹剧。乘客的日子百无聊赖，而且我和同行的人没共同语言，别提有多孤单了。那片海洋像被油污了似的，令人昏昏欲睡，加上那永远面目沉暗的海岸，仿佛远离了真实的世界，弄得我情绪低落，整日胡思乱想，简直要发疯。不时传来的海浪声欢快清新，仿佛兄弟的笑语。那自然的声音，有它自己的因缘和含义。忽然一条船从岸边划过来，暂时地将这画面变成了一道现世的风景。黑人们在划桨，远远地就能看见他们那些白得发亮的眼珠。他们大喊大叫，放声歌唱；他们大汗淋漓；他们的脸像古怪的面具——这些家伙啊；但他们有骨头，有肌肉，有一种狂野的生命力，动作散发着无穷的力量，就像岸边的海浪一样自然真实。他们仿佛天然地就应该出现在那里。看着他们，但觉心旷神怡。那一阵子我会感到自己又回到了那个无遮无掩的现实世界，但那种感觉终归是短暂的，总有点什么会冒出来惊散它。我记得有一次我们偶遇一艘停泊在岸边的军舰。岸上连一间棚屋都没有，那军舰却在向灌木丛使劲儿放炮，看来法国人正在那附近打仗。她的船旗像块破布一样死沉沉地耷拉着，船身低处的八英寸长筒炮全部升了起来。油污的海浪一闪一闪，懒洋洋地把它抛上抛下，那单薄的桅杆东摇西摆。在这一片巨大的虚空中，只有大地、天空和海洋，她却在那里不可理喻地向一片大陆开着火。砰！一门八英寸长筒炮开火了，一小团火焰狂奔而出，转眼就熄灭了，那缕瘦瘦的白烟也随之消失，一颗小小的炮弹低低地惨叫一声——然后什么事也没有。能有什么事呢？这个过程真有点神经兮兮的，一个可笑又可叹的场面。船上有人一本正经地向我解释说那里有一个土著的军营——他竟然叫他们敌人！——藏在岸上某个地方，说得言之凿凿的。但那并不能改变我的感受。”

“我们把信送到那条船上（听说在那艘孤独的船上，每天都有三个人死于热病）后继续前进。我们又在一些名字古怪的港口靠岸，它们像热得过分的地下古墓，宁静的空气里弥漫着泥土味，死神和贸易在墓里翩翩起舞。我们沿着没有固定形状的海岸前行，浪花冷酷凶险地拍着岸，就像大自然正自发努力想要挡开入侵者。一条又一条的河，死亡之流源源不绝地流出流入，把河岸腐蚀成烂泥，河水变污变稠，摧毁着扭曲的红树林，那些树好像在向我们痛苦地扭动着，极端绝望，束手无策。我们在任何一个地方都待不长，无法留下特别详细的印象，只是笼统地觉得有一种日益滋长的疑惑，模糊而滞闷。就像走不完的旅程，无聊透顶，仿佛一场噩梦。”

“走了三十多天，终于看到那条大河的河口。我们的船停泊在政府所在地附近的岸边。但我还要往前走两百多英里才能开工。所以我逮住一个机会，出发去上游三十英里的一个地方。”

“我坐的是一条航海小汽船。船长是瑞典人，听说我是个水手，就请我到驾驶台上去。他很年轻，瘦削白皙，神情阴郁，头发细长，走起路来拖泥带水。我们离开那个凄惨的小码头时，他轻蔑地向岸边甩甩头。‘您就住那儿？’他问。我说：‘没错。’‘那些政府官员真够意思——不是吗？’他继续说，说的是英文，用语极度精确，话里藏针，‘真是有意思，有些人为了一个月挣那几个法郎，简直什么都做得出来。我真想知道上游是什么光景。’我告诉他我很快就能看到了。‘这样啊！’他惊叫起来。他横拖着步子走了几步，警觉地注视着前方。‘不要掉以轻心，’他继续说道，‘前几天我救起了一个家伙，他在路上上吊自杀。也是个瑞典人。’‘上吊自杀！天啊！有什么看不开的？’我喊了出来。他依然保持着警觉。‘谁知道呢？实在受不了那大太阳，又或者是那鬼地方。’”

“最后，我们驶进一条开阔的水道，看见一道岩石满布的悬崖，岸边翻出成堆的泥土，一座小山上有许多房子。在被挖出来的一堆堆废物之间，在山坡上，散落着其他用铁皮做顶的房子。上方不断传来急流的响声，在这片住了人的废墟上回旋激荡。很多人，几乎都是黑皮肤，赤身裸体，像蚂蚁一样窜来窜去。一个小码头伸入河中。阳光忽然变得刺眼，让人什么都看不见。‘那就是您公司的贸易站，’瑞典人说，指着三间像兵营一样的木屋子，它们颤巍巍地架在满是岩石的斜坡上，‘我找人帮您把东西运上去。您是说四个箱子吧？祝您好运。再见。’”

“我在路上碰上一个深埋在草丛里的锅炉，又发现了一条通上山的小路。这条路绕开了所有挡道的大石头，以及一节轮子朝天的铁皮火车车厢。其中一个轮子不见了。这节车厢躺在那里一动不动，就像某只动物的尸体一样。一路上我看见更多朽烂的机器和一堆生锈的铁轨。在路的左边，一片树林投下一块浓荫，里面似乎有些什么黑暗的物体在衰弱地蠕动着。我眨眨眼，前面的路很陡。路的右边传来号角声，我看见很多黑人跑过。突然响起一阵沉闷的爆炸声，地动山摇，悬崖上冒出一股烟，然后一切恢复正常。岩石的外表没有发生任何变化。他们正在修铁路。那悬崖并没有挡道，但这种盲目的爆破就是他们的全部工作。”

“我身后传来一阵轻细的叮当声，引得我回过头看。六个黑人排成一排，艰难地沿着小路往上爬。他们挺直身子，慢慢地爬，头上顶着装满土的小篮，小心翼翼，每走一步便是一阵叮当声。他们的腰部缠着黑色的破布，后面垂下短短的一截，像尾巴一样摇来摇去。他们的每条肋骨都清晰可见，四肢的关节就像绳子上打的结。每个人颈上都有一个铁项圈，一条铁链把所有项圈拴在一起，链环在他们之间左摇右晃，发出节奏清晰的叮当声。从悬崖那边又传来一阵爆炸声，我突然想起之前看到过的那艘军舰，向陆地开火的那艘。一样是不吉祥的声音。但再异想天开些，眼前这些人也不会像敌人。他们被称为罪犯，那被忤逆了的法律，就像炸开了的炮弹一样击中了他们，是一个来自海洋的谜，无法解释。他们瘦弱的胸膛全在一起喘着气，撑开了的鼻孔颤抖着，眼光呆滞地盯着山上。他们就这样从我身边经过，离我不到六英寸，没有看我一眼，浑身上下透着土人在遭难时那种完全的冷漠，就好像他们已经死了。在这些生番后面，走着一个已经受过教化的黑人。他是新势力得势后的产物，提着一支来复枪半死不活地慢慢走着。他穿一件掉了一个纽扣的制服外套，看见路上有个白人，连忙把武器举到肩膀。这么做只是慎重起见。隔这么远，白人看起来都是一个样的，他无法分辨我可能是什么人。他很快放下心来，绽开一个大大的笑容，猥琐下流，充分展露了他的白牙。他扫了一眼他负责看管的犯人，仿佛邀请我去和他一起分享这份光荣的职责。毕竟，这项崇高正义的伟业方兴未艾，而我是其中一部分。”

“我没有往上爬，转身从左边下坡。我这么做，是想等看不见这排锁在铁链里的人之后再上山。我可不是个温婉的家伙，迫不得已的时候我也曾奋起自卫过。有时候我也被逼反抗和进攻——进攻只是一种反抗的方式——这样的一时冲动可能会改变我的人生，带来种种后果，然而我无暇精打细算。我见识过暴力的魔鬼、贪婪的魔鬼和渴望的魔鬼，但是，上天做证！这些魔鬼都强大、健壮和双眼发红，迷惑并奴役着人——是的，是人。但当我站在这个山腰上，我能预见到在那块土地上，夺目的阳光里，我将很快认识一个新的魔鬼，他贪得无厌，笨得要死，满身赘肉，故作姿态，鼠目寸光。再过几个月，再走一千英里，我就能知道他有多么阴毒奸狡。我突然站定了，满心恐惧，好像受到了警告一般。最后我七弯八拐地下了山，去找之前看到的那片树林。”

“我绕开一个人工挖出来的大洞，那洞好像挖了很久，但挖来干什么，我无从猜测。反正不是采石场或者采沙坑，就只是个洞。也许是有人忽发善心，想要让那些罪犯有事可做吧。我不知道。然后我差点掉进一条非常狭窄的山沟，它不过就像山腰上的一道小疤痕。我发现有很多供居民点使用的排水管被扔在沟里。那可是千里迢迢运来的，现在却没一根是好的。真是一团糟。后来我终于找到了那片树林。我本来是想在树荫下散会儿步的，但一走进去，就好像踏进了某个地狱的一圈阴影里。急流近在咫尺，在寂静得哀伤的小树林里，只听见那阵猛烈的水声，持续不断，单调乏味，急急忙忙。树林里一丝风也没有，所有树叶都凝滞不动，却有那么一阵神秘的声响——仿佛地球那轰轰隆隆的脚步声突然变得清晰可闻。”

“许多黑色的人影蜷伏着、躺着或是倚着树干坐在树与树之间，他们仿佛长在地里，一半暴露在地上，一半隐没在阴影中，做出各种痛苦、听天由命和绝望的姿势。悬崖那边又爆炸了，我脚下的土地一阵轻轻战栗。人们还在那边工作着。工作！那些无法再工作的人，就来这里等死。”

“他们正慢慢死去——非常明显。他们不是敌人，他们不是罪犯，他们不再是现世的存在物——什么也不是，只是疾病和饥饿的黑影，乱糟糟地躺在墨绿色的阴影中。通过完全合法的定期合同，有人把他们从沿岸各个隐蔽之处招聘来。他们在这恶劣的环境中茫然无助，食物吃不惯，生了病，无法继续工作，就被允许爬到这里来休息。这些奄奄一息的影子就像空气一样轻飘飘的——也差不多跟空气一样稀薄。我开始看见树下有许多眼睛在泛着光。然后，我低头看时，发现手边有一张脸。一副黑色的人骨挺得笔直，一个肩膀抵着树，眼皮缓缓抬起，凹陷的眼睛翻上来看看我，巨大而空洞，一种盲人似的白光在眼底微微闪烁，慢慢熄灭。似乎还很年轻——几乎是个小孩儿——但很难看出他们的真实年龄。我觉得好像应该做点什么，便从口袋里掏出一块我乘坐的那上好的瑞典船上的饼干给他。他的手指慢慢闭拢起来，抓住了那块饼干——再没有其他动作，也没有再看我一眼。他的脖子上绑着一缕白色的精纺毛线——为什么？他从哪儿得来的？那是一个记号——一种装饰——一个符咒——还是一种祈愿的仪式？它到底有没有含义？这一缕属于海洋彼岸的白毛线，竟然缠在他的脖子上，实在有些格格不入。”

“在这棵树旁边，还有两副尖瘦的黑骨头抱膝而坐。其中一个把下巴支在膝盖上，呆呆地瞪着眼睛，那神情恐怖非常，让人不敢多看。他的同伴，另一个幽灵则把额头枕在膝盖上，像被巨大的疲倦打垮了。其他人分散在各处，姿势各异，扭曲着苟延残喘，就像画里面大屠杀或者大瘟疫的场景。我站在那里，震惊得呆若木鸡，忽然一个幽灵用手和膝盖撑起身来，手脚并用，爬向河边喝水。他舔干双手，在阳光中坐起来，盘起双腿，不多久，他那毛茸茸的脑袋便沉沉地垂到胸骨上。”

“我不愿久留，匆忙逃向贸易站。走近那片建筑物的时候，我碰到一个白人，他的装束出乎意料的优雅，乍一看还以为是幻觉。我看见一个高高的衣领，浆得挺直，干干净净的白袖口，浅色的羊驼毛夹克，雪白的长裤，鲜亮的领带，擦得锃亮的皮靴。他没戴帽子。分头，头发刷得油亮亮的，一只大白手撑着一把绿纹遮阳伞。他真是神奇，耳后还夹着一管自来水笔杆。”

“我和这一奇迹握手，得知他是公司的会计主任，公司所有账目都归这个贸易站整理和登记。他溜出来一小会儿，按他的话说，‘出来透透气’。这话听起来奇怪得很，背后是没完没了的案牍生活。要不是我是从他嘴里第一次听到另一个人的名字，而这另一个人又是这段回忆不可或缺的一部分，我根本不会向你们提及他。况且，我也尊敬这个家伙。我尊敬他。我尊敬他的衣领，他那巨大的袖口，他那刷得油亮亮的脑袋。他看起来确实跟理发店橱窗里的假人模特一式一样，但在这样一片毫无生气的土地上，他竟保住了光鲜的外表，多么有骨气！他那浆硬的领子和胸部笔挺的衬衫代表着人格的成就。他到这里来差不多有三年了，我忍不住问他是怎样把衣服打理得那么像样的。他双颊微微泛红，谦虚地说：‘我在教站里的一个土著女人做事。真是不容易，她本来可讨厌这些业务了。’这么说来，这个人还真有点贡献。他也倾尽心思在账簿上，把它们整理得井井有条。”

“站里其他的一切都杂乱无章——人啊，物啊，房子啊。商队，一队队八字脚的黑人，风尘仆仆地来来去去，工业产品、劣质的棉花、珠子和铜线络绎不绝地被运进黑暗深处，涓涓细流一般地换回珍稀的象牙。”

我要在这个贸易站等十天——简直望不到头。我在院子里支了个帐篷住着，但为了避开那片混乱，我有时会躲进会计办公室。那是用横条木板建成的，手工很差，会计主任在高高的书桌上伏案工作的时候，浑身上下满是一条条窄窄的阳光。不用拉开百叶窗也能看到外面。办公室里也很热，大苍蝇恶毒地嗡嗡作响，虽然不叮人，却四处撞人。我一般坐在地上，他则高高地坐在高脚凳上写个不停，一身装束无懈可击（甚至微微生香）。有时他站起来活动筋骨。有人匆匆忙忙地把一张装有脚轮的矮床推进办公室，上面躺着一个病人（某个从内地来的代理人），他表示出微微的恼怒。‘这位病人的呻吟声，’他说，‘使我无法集中精神。在这种气候里，如果不能高度集中精神，算错账是很难避免的。’

一天他低着头说：‘在内地，您肯定会见到库尔茨先生。’我问库尔茨先生是何方神圣，他说是个头等的代理人。看见我对这个信息流露出失望之情，他搁下笔，继续慢慢地说：‘他可是个相当了不起的人。’我追问下去，他说库尔茨先生现在负责一个贸易站，那个贸易站可重要了，在真正的象牙之乡，在‘那里的最深处。他送来的象牙跟其他人加起来的一样多……’他又提笔工作。病人虚弱得已经无力呻吟了。在一片巨大的宁静中，只有苍蝇在嗡嗡叫个不停。

突然传来一阵越来越大的说话声和沉重有力的脚步声。一个商队进站了。木板的另一边爆发出一阵粗野狂烈的声音，吵吵嚷嚷地不知道在说什么。所有搬运工都在说话，在一片吵闹之中，我们听见站长用悲痛的声音在说：‘我们尽力了。’那句话他那天带着哭腔说了有二十遍……会计主任慢慢起身。‘真是吵死人了。’他说。他轻轻地走到屋子另一边去看看病人，又折回来，对我说：‘他什么都听不见。’‘你说什么！他死了吗？’我问，真是吓坏了。‘不，还没有死。’他不动声色地说。然后，他朝外间的喧闹声甩甩头，暗示道：‘当你不得不把账记清楚的时候，实在是无法不讨厌这些野蛮人——真是烦死他们了！’他思索了一会儿，‘您看见库尔茨先生的时候，’他接着说，‘请告诉他这里的每一件东西’——他斜了桌子一眼——‘都非常令人满意。我不喜欢给他写信——我们的信使都靠不住，天知道他们会把信送到谁手里——在那个中央贸易站。’他用那双温和而突出的眼睛盯着我看了一会儿，‘哦，他前途无限，无可限量，’他又说，‘不久就会变成管理部门的要人。他们，那些高层——欧洲的董事会——很赏识他。’

他继续埋头工作。外面终于安静了。过了一会儿，我要出去，走到门口又停住了。苍蝇还在不知疲倦地嗡嗡叫着，将要被运送回国的代理人躺在那里，脸涨得通红，已然没有了意识。屋子里另一个人正趴在账簿上，清清楚楚地记着账，毫无差错。门阶下方五十英尺的地方，我看得见那片死亡之林寂静不动的树梢。

第二天，我终于跟一个六十个人的商队离开了那个贸易站，开始了一段两百英里长的徒步旅程。

那段旅程没什么好说的。反正到处都是小路。人们踩出来一张路网，网住那片空荡荡的土地，穿过长长的草地，穿过被火烧过的草地，穿过灌木丛，穿越寒冷的峡谷，翻越闪着火光的石山。荒凉又荒凉，一个人也没有，一间茅屋也没有。居民很久之前就跑光了。试想想，如果有很多神秘的黑人，武装着各种可怕的武器，突然开始流窜在迪尔和格雷夫森德[18]之间的大路上，把住在路两旁的英国佬都抓去做搬运工，那一带所有农场和村庄肯定也会很快荒废掉。只是这里连房子都不见了。但我沿途也见到好几个被遗弃的村庄。那些残破不堪的草墙像一种可悲的儿戏。六十双光脚的踏步声和划地声日复一日地跟在我身后，每一双脚上面都有六十磅的重物。扎营，做饭，睡觉，拔营，跋涉。不时一个搬运工背着重物倒下，长眠在路边高高的草丛中，一个空的水葫芦和一根长棍子会陪在他身边。四周和上空是一片逃不出的死寂。也许在某个安静的夜晚，能听见遥远的鼓声，战栗着，沉下去，又响起来，茫茫荒野里的挣扎，软弱无力的。这个怪异的声音，魅惑的，暗示的，野性的——说不定和基督教国家的钟声一样意味深远。有一次我们看见一个白人，制服的纽扣都开了，带着一个高高瘦瘦的桑格巴尔人——他的武装护卫——在路边扎营，他友善而快活——肯定是喝醉了。他声称自己在检查这条马路的养护工作。哪里有什么马路需要养护！他们也什么都没干。倒是前头三英里处有一具中年黑人的尸体，额头被子弹打出一个洞，确实是把我绊了一跤，可能他把这叫作一个永恒的改善。我还有一个白人同伴，人倒不坏，但有点儿胖过头了，有一个不断加剧的毛病：一爬上炎热的山坡就要晕过去，而最近的一点树荫和水源还在好几英里之外。真可恶，我们不得不把外套撑起来给他当遮阳伞，遮住他的头，等他慢慢苏醒。有一次我忍不住问他到底为什么要跑这儿来。‘当然是为了挣钱。不然呢？’他不屑地说。后来他发起烧来，我们只好把他放进吊床，挂在木杆上抬着他走。为此搬运工跟我吵了不知道有多少次，因为他足足重十六英石[19]。他们消极怠工，逃跑，夜里带着行囊偷偷溜走——简直是造反。所以，一个晚上，我比手画脚地用英语发表了演讲，我面前那六十双雪亮的眼睛都明白了我的意思，第二天早晨他们就在我面前乖乖抬着吊床出发了。但一个小时后，我在灌木丛里发现了整个这一切的残骸——那家伙，吊床，呻吟声，毯子，恐惧。沉重的木杆擦破了他的鼻子，真可怜。他非常急切地要求我杀死某个人，但附近连一个搬运工的影子都没有。我记起那个老医生说的话——‘当场密切关注个人精神状态的变化是很有意义的’——我感到我要开始对科学的发展产生意义了。然而我并不觉得那有什么用。在第十五天，我又看见了那条大河，便一瘸一拐地走进了中央贸易站。它坐落在河湾上，藏在灌木丛和森林之中，一面是用臭泥巴做成的边界，破破烂烂的，另外三面被疯长的灯芯草篱笆团团围住，一个没人修整的缺口就是它唯一的门口。一看就知道这里的主管是个窝囊废。几个手里拿着长棍的白人从房子之间懒洋洋地走出来，不紧不慢地晃上来看了我一眼，又走开不见了。其中有一个蓄着黑胡子的胖子，很是大惊小怪，我一告诉他我是谁，他就滔滔不绝、东拉西扯地告诉我，我的汽船沉到河底去了。我仿佛遭到五雷轰顶。什么，怎么回事，为什么？哦，‘没关系。’‘经理本人’就在船上。一切如常。‘每个人的表现都值得表扬！值得表扬！’——‘您务必，’他颤抖着说，‘马上去见经理。他在等您！’

我一时还不明白船沉了意味着什么。我想我现在明白了，但不敢确定——一点儿也不。这件事情摆明就是太愚蠢了——每当我想起它——简直就蠢得出奇。但……但在那一刻，我就觉得它不过是一件恼人的麻烦事而已。船沉了。他们两天前急急忙忙驾船开往上游，经理也在船上，负责开船的船长是个志愿者。开出去不到三个小时，船底就被石头划开了，船在南岸附近沉没了。我不禁问自己：船都没了，我来这还能做什么？事实上，我要做很多事，以便把归我指挥的那条船捞上来。我必须第二天就出发去开工。把沉船捞上来，运回贸易站修理，要花好几个月的时间。

我和经理的第一次会面相当奇怪。当天早上，我走了二十英里的路才见到他，他却没有请我坐。他的表情、五官、仪态和声音都平淡无奇。他不高不矮，不胖不瘦。他那双蓝眼睛的颜色很普通，眼神却冷漠得过分，他盯着人看的时候，无疑能把这眼神变得跟沉重的利斧一样劈向人。但即使是在这些时候，他身体的其余部分却依然平淡如常。此外就只剩下他嘴唇上那种难以捉摸的表情，微乎其微，总有点鬼鬼祟祟，似笑非笑的，我到现在还记得清清楚楚，但解释不了。它不是故意的，这种微笑，尽管他每说完一次话，它又变明显一些。他一闭嘴，它就出现，就像拿封印把话封住一样，哪怕只是最平常的话，也弄得绝对不可理解似的。他是个普通的商人，从年轻时起就受聘在这些地区工作——从来没干过别的。大家都听他指挥，然而他没有令别人爱上他或是害怕他，大家对他甚至连尊敬都谈不上。他只能令人感到浑身不自在。就是这话！浑身不自在。也不是明确的不信任——只是浑身不自在——仅此而已。你们不知道这样一帮……一帮……职员的效率有多么低下。他没有组织能力、创新能力，甚至连好好发号施令都不会。他把这个可怜的贸易站搞得乌烟瘴气，就是最好的证明。他没有学问，智力低下。他居然被提拔为经理——怎么会这样？大概就是因为他从来不生病……他在那里熬过了三个三年的聘期……在人人都生病的地方，强健的体魄本身就是一种力量。他每次休假回家都会去大肆寻欢作乐一番。跟上了岸的水手似的——当然他不一样——只不过他的外表光鲜一些。这一点从他不经意的闲谈中也听得出来。他墨守成规，但能够保持日常工作的正常运转——他只有这点本事。但他是个了不起的人物。没人知道有什么可以控制得了这样一个人，光这一点就足以令他了不起。他从来不泄露个中秘密。也许他身体里空无一物。但这种怀疑永远无法证实——在那个地方没法做外科检查。有一次，多种热带疾病突然暴发，站里几乎所有‘代理人’都病倒了，却有人听到他说：‘出来这里的人就不应该有内脏。’他又用那种奇怪的笑容封印住这句话，仿佛那是一扇开往黑暗世界的大门，而他恰好是看门人。仿佛看到点儿什么——但门马上就关上了。那些白人吃饭的时候老是为了谁坐上座吵个不停，把他吵烦了，他就命令人做了一张巨大的圆桌，做好了没地方摆得下，就又另外盖了一间屋子。贸易站的食堂就是这么来的。他坐的地方就是首席——剩下的，坐哪里都一样。人们觉得他就是怀有这种信念，坚定不移的。他既不文雅也不粗野。他很安静。他允许他的‘跟班’——一个来自海岸地区的青年黑人，被养得肥头大耳的——就在他眼皮底下对那些白人粗暴无礼、兴风作浪。

他一见到我就说个不停。我走得太慢了。他等不起，只好先开船。上游的贸易站急需物资供应。已经耽搁得太久，他都不知道哪个死了，哪个还活着，他们情况如何——等等，等等。他完全不听我解释，摆弄着一根封口蜡棒，重复了好几次说形势‘非常严峻，非常严峻’。有流言说一个非常重要的贸易站情况危急，站长库尔茨先生也病倒了。希望不是真的。库尔茨先生是……我累坏了，烦躁得要命。让库尔茨去死吧，我想。我打断他说我在岸上对库尔茨先生有所听闻。‘啊！他们在下游地区也谈论他啊。’他嘟嘟囔囔地自言自语。然后他又开始说个没完，向我保证库尔茨先生是他手底下最好的代理人，非凡卓绝，公司决不能没有他，这样我应该理解他为什么这么焦虑了吧。他说自己真是‘非常，非常担忧’。确实，他在椅子上不停地扭来扭去，大声喊道：‘啊，库尔茨先生！’把封口蜡棒都掰断了，却又被这个意外事件吓住了。接下来他想知道‘需要花多长时间去’……我又打断他。我快饿死了，又站了那么久，丧失了耐性。‘你问我，我问谁去？’我说，‘我还没见到那条沉船呢——好几个月吧，短不了。’这场对话对我来说真是浪费时间。‘好几个月，’他说，‘好吧，那我们三个月后就可以出发了。好。这件工作三个月足够了。’我气呼呼地从他的小屋出来（他自己住一间小泥屋，屋外还带一条简陋的走廊），一边自己向自己咕哝着对他的看法。他是个唠唠叨叨的傻瓜。日后我收回了这句话，因为他对这件‘工作’需要的时间估计得一丝不差，真是惊人。

第二天我就开工了。可以说我把贸易站抛诸脑后。我觉得只有那样我才能紧紧抓住实实在在的生活，弥补这一段时间的空虚感。然而，人总是会开小差东张西望的。然后我看见了那个贸易站，那些男人在院子里的阳光底下漫无目的地逛来逛去。有时我问自己，他们这是在干什么。他们拿着滑稽的长棍子，魂不守舍地走来走去，就像很多变了节的朝圣者，被鬼勾了魂，在那个破篱笆里来回打转。‘象牙’这个词在空气中回荡，他们低声念叨着它，叹息里也全是它，真的像在向它祈祷似的。到处隐隐弥漫着一丝愚蠢而贪婪的气味，就像尸体发出的臭味。天啊！我从未见过如此不真实的景象。贸易站外，那片寂静无声的荒野紧紧包围着这一小块开拓出来的地方，在我看来是那么伟大而不容对抗，就像邪恶或真理一样。它不急不躁地，等待这一次疯狂的侵略自行结束。

哦，那几个月！好吧，别提了。后来又发生了很多事。一个晚上，一个装满白棉布、印花棉布、玻璃珠的草棚，不知道还有没有放别的，突然着火，仿佛地球突然裂开，放出一团复仇之火来，要把那些垃圾统统烧掉。我在那拆开了的汽船旁边安静地抽着烟斗，看见他们都在火光中跳来跳去，高举双臂，那个蓄着胡子的胖男人拿着水桶猛冲向河边，一边还不忘向我保证说每个人都‘值得表扬，值得表扬！’打起一夸脱左右的水又猛冲回去。我注意到他的桶底有个窟窿。

我慢慢走上前去。急也没用，那草棚像盒火柴一样烧得一发不可收拾。从一开始就毫无希望。火焰蹿得高高的，把所有人都挡了回去，照亮了一切——然后猛然熄灭了。草棚已经被烧成一堆灼热的灰烬。他们在一旁打一个黑人，据说这次失火都怪他。就算真的是他，他叫得也太凄惨了些。过后我看见他连续几天坐在一片小小的树荫下，奄奄一息的样子，努力挣扎着想康复；后来他站起来走了——荒野无声无息地把他吞了回去。我从黑暗走近那堆余烬的时候，发现前面有两个人在聊天。我听见他们提到库尔茨的名字，又听见什么‘利用这次不幸的事故’之类的话。其中一个是经理，我向他道了夜安。‘你之前有碰到过这样的事情吗——啊？真不敢相信。’他说，然后走开了。另一个男人留在原地。他是一个头等的代理人，年轻，彬彬有礼，略带矜持，蓄着八字胡，长着鹰钩鼻。他刻意和其他代理人保持距离，他们私下里说他是经理派来监视他们的密探。我呢，我之前没怎么跟他说过话。我们开始交谈，慢慢从发着嘶嘶声的废墟前走开去。他请我去他位于贸易站主楼内的房间。他划亮一根火柴，我注意到这个年轻的贵族不仅有一个镶银的化妆盒，还能一个人用一整根蜡烛——那时就只有经理有点蜡烛的权利。墙上覆着当地的草垫，还挂着许多战利品：长矛、非洲梭枪、盾牌和刀子。这位先生负责制砖的业务——别人是这么跟我说的，但站里连砖头的碎块都找不着，而他在那里都有一年多了——一直在等。似乎没有某些材料就不能制砖，我不知道是什么——说不定是麦秆。无论如何，那里是没有麦秆的，也不太可能从欧洲运来，所以我也弄不明白他到底在等什么。也许是某个奇迹吧。然而，他们全部人都一直在等——那十六个还是二十个朝圣者。说真的，从他们的工作态度来看，他们应该并不觉得这份工作有多么糟糕，尽管他们唯一要做的事好像就只是生病——据我所知。他们通过愚蠢地相互中伤和酝酿谋害同伴的计划来消磨时间。贸易站里总是疑云密布——当然没有哪个阴谋被付诸实践。这片疑云就像站里其他的一切那样不真实——与这个公司的慈善外衣、人们虚伪的谈话、公司的管理制度和人们在工作中的表现一样。唯一真实的，是被委派到贸易站当负责人的渴望。贸易站可能有象牙，他们可以通过买卖象牙获得分成。他们相互仇恨，相互设计陷害，相互中伤，都只是由于这个缘故——但如果你要叫他们动动手指头做点什么正经事——别做梦。天啊！世上毕竟有这么一样东西，允许一个人偷一匹马，却不许另一个人对缰绳产生非分之想。直接把马偷走吧。很好。他照做了。说不定他会骑马呢！但有时如果有人望一眼缰绳，也会惹得最慈悲为怀的大圣人勃然大怒。

我不知道他为什么要跟我说那么多话，但谈着谈着，我突然想到这家伙心怀鬼胎——实际上，在套我的话。他反复拐弯抹角地提到欧洲，提到我可能在那里认识的人——用问题引我说话，引我说起那个死城里的熟人之类的。他的小眼睛好像两片闪闪发亮的云母片——充满好奇——尽管他努力装出一副爱理不理的样子。刚开始我还挺惊讶的，但很快又感到很好奇，想看看他到底想打探什么消息。我完全想象不出自己藏了什么话，值得他花这么多心机去打探。看着他在费尽心思地让自己失望，真的很有趣。因为其实我肚子里只有一股寒气，我的脑子里也只有那条倒霉的汽船。很明显，他把我当成了恬不知耻的大骗子。最后他生气了，为了遮掩一个怒火中烧的举动，他打了个呵欠。我站起身。然后我注意到在房门的嵌板上钉着一幅小小的油画草图，画的是一个女人，披着布，蒙着眼，拿一个燃烧着的火把。背景一片灰暗——近乎漆黑。那女人的动作庄严神圣，火把的光芒映在她的脸上，很是邪恶凶险。

我被那幅画迷住了。他客客气气地站在一旁，手里托着一个空的半品脱香槟瓶（用于宁神静气），瓶口插着一根蜡烛。我向他问起这幅画，他说是库尔茨先生画的——在这个贸易站的时候，一年多之前——在等待合适的交通工具前往他的贸易站那会儿。‘告诉我，老兄，’我说，‘库尔茨先生是谁？’

‘内地贸易站的站长。’他简短地说，别过脸去。‘受教了，’我笑着说，‘而您是中央贸易站的制砖负责人。大家都知道。’他沉默了片刻。‘他是个天才，’他终于开口说道，‘他是慈悲、科学和进步的使者。鬼才知道他还是什么。我们想要的是，’他突然开始慷慨陈词，‘为了使欧洲那边委托给我们的事业能得到更好的指导，比方说，更高明的才智、广泛的同情心和团结一致的目标。’‘这是谁说的？’我问。‘他们很多人都这么说，’他回答，‘还有人把这些话写在文章里，于是他来了。他可是个特殊人物，这点您应该也是知道的吧。’‘我凭什么知道？’我打断他，惊讶极了。他没理我。‘是的，现在他掌管着最好的贸易站，明年就会变成副经理，再过两年……但我确定您知道两年后他会变成怎样。您属于新派——美德派。特意把他派来的人又推荐了您。哦，您别否认。我相信自己的眼睛。’我现在明白了。我那亲爱的姨妈果然有一些有权有势的朋友，现在这些朋友开始对这个年轻人产生了意料之外的效果。我差点哈哈大笑起来。‘您也看公司的内部通讯？’我问。他无话可说。太好玩了。‘等库尔茨先生，’我板起脸继续说道，‘当了总经理，您就没戏了。’

他冷不丁地吹灭了蜡烛，我们一同走出屋子。月亮已经升了起来。黑暗的人影无精打采地四处乱窜，把水泼在不断嘶嘶作响的余烬上。月光下升起缕缕蒸汽，那个遭毒打的黑人在某个地方呻吟着。‘这畜生真会捅乱子！’那个精力旺盛的八字胡先生边说边向我们走过来。‘打得好！犯法——惩罚——砰！不能心软，不能心软。只能这么办。这才能防止日后再发生严重的火灾。我刚才还跟经理说……’他看清了我的同伴，马上老实了，‘您还没睡呢，’他说，带着一种奴颜媚骨的热情，‘太正常了。哈！危险——焦虑。’连忙溜走了。我继续走向河边，我的同伴跟随着我。耳边隐隐传来一句刺耳的话：‘一群笨蛋——该死。’那些朝圣者们三五成群聚在一起，手舞足蹈地发表着议论，有几个还拿着他们的棍子。我真的相信他们睡觉都拿着棍子。在篱笆的外面，月光下的森林仿佛一群狰狞的鬼怪，大地的寂静穿透了昏暗中的骚动，穿透了这个可悲的院子里发出的轻响，直达人的心底——它的不可知，它的浩荡，它隐含的生命的惊人真相。受伤的黑人在我们身边某处微弱地呻吟着，又深深地叹了一口气，我听不下去，加快脚步走开去。我感到有一只手探到我的手臂底下。‘我亲爱的先生，’那个家伙说，‘我不想别人误解我，尤其是您，因为您很快就会有幸见到库尔茨先生，而我还要等很久。我不想让他错误地以为我另有所图……’

“我任由这个纸糊的靡菲斯特[20]滔滔不绝地讲下去，仿佛如果我使点劲儿就能用食指戳穿他，并很可能发现里面除了几点污垢之外什么都没有。这下你们明白了吧？这家伙一心想着好好巴结当时的经理，好慢慢爬上副经理的位置，但那个库尔茨半路杀了出来，打乱了他们的如意算盘。他仓促地说个不停，我也没想打断他。我把肩膀倚在汽船的残骸上。我们把它打捞上来，放在岸边的斜坡上，好像它是一只大河怪的尸体。扑鼻的泥土味——远古时期的泥土，天啊！高高的原始森林一动不动地立在眼前，黑色的小溪上泛起块块亮光。月亮把一层薄薄的银纱覆在万物之上——在杂草上，在泥上，在比庙墙还要高的乱林上，在那条大河上——那条河是如此宽广，静静流淌着，在一个幽暗的缺口之外闪烁生辉。一切都很美好，生机涌动，安然无声，而那个家伙竟一直在啰里啰唆地为自己解释。我在想，这片广袤无垠的荒野一脸沉静地望着我们二人，似是有所请求，又像在发出威胁。迷途至此的我们到底是什么？我们能够操控这个哑巴一样的庞然巨物吗？还是将臣服于它？这一个没有嘴巴，说不定连耳朵都没有的巨物，是如此庞大，庞大得深不见底。那里面究竟藏了什么？我可以看到一点象牙从深处流出，听说库尔茨先生就在那里。我实在听够库尔茨这个名字了——上天做证！然而不知怎的他还没有形成一个具体的形象——就好像我不过是听见说那里面有一个天使或者一个魔鬼。这种情况就像听到有人说火星上有居民一样，信不信由你。我认识一个苏格兰的修帆工，他拍胸脯保证说火星上有人，但如果你问他火星人长什么样，言谈举止如何，他会马上涨红了脸，含含糊糊地说什么‘用四条腿走路’。要是你敢笑，他就会——尽管都六十岁了——跟你打起来。我不会为了库尔茨跟人打架，但却是因为他，我差一点撒了谎。我是最恨别人撒谎的，太可恶了，我受不了。不是因为我比其他人正直，只是因为谎言使我恐惧。谎言总带着一丝死亡的阴影，说得人满嘴腐臭——这世上我最讨厌和最憎恨的莫过于此——我真想把它彻底忘掉。它让我痛苦、恶心，就像一口咬到腐烂的食物。我想这是一种天性。好吧，我放任那个年轻人天马行空地幻想我在欧洲的影响力，也差不多是在撒谎了。刹那间我也学会了虚张声势，就跟那些深受蛊惑的朝圣者一样。这仅仅是因为我突然产生了一个想法，这么做可能对于当时与我素未谋面的库尔茨多少有点好处——你们能理解吧。那时他对我而言只是一个名字。你们看得见他吗？你们看得见这个故事吗？你们看得见任何东西吗？我好像在对你们说一个梦——真是吃力不讨好，因为梦里的感受是无从通过语言传递的。挣扎着想反抗，浑身颤抖，铺天盖地的荒诞、惊奇和迷乱相互交织，总感觉要被一种超自然的力量抓住，这些感受才是梦的本质……”

他沉默了片刻。

“……不，那不可能。人生中某一段时期的感受是无法转述的，正是这种感受，构成了人生的真相和意义——人生的本质，微妙而贯穿始终。不可能的。人生如梦——一样的孤独……”

他又停下来，好像在思考，然后接下去说——

“当然，对于当时的情况，你们这些家伙比当时的我要看得清楚一些。你们很了解我的为人……”

天已经很暗了，我们这些听众几乎看不见彼此。已经有很长的一段时间，独自坐在一旁的他对我们而言只剩下一个声音。其他人都悄无声息，可能都已经昏昏睡去，我却还醒着。我还在听，一直在听，字字句句都留心着，寻求着蛛丝马迹，以求解释为什么这个故事引起了我隐约的不安。它似乎不是从双唇流出的，而是在这条沉重的河流上空，那稠滞的夜色中自行上演。

“……是的——我任他往下说，”马洛又开始了，随他想象我有什么靠山。管他呢！但其实我什么靠山都没有！除了身后那条又旧又可怜的破汽船。当他夸夸其谈着什么‘每一个人都必须努力升职’，‘人们不是，您也知道，来这儿看月亮的’。库尔茨先生是一个‘无所不能的天才’，但就算是天才，和‘合适的工具——聪明的人’一起工作也会轻松得多。他并没有制砖——为什么呢？因为有不可抗力——我应该很清楚才对。而说到他为经理做秘书做的工作，那是因为‘哪个理智的人会不知轻重地辜负上司的信任呢？’我明白了吗？明白了。我还想怎样？我想要铆钉，天啊！铆钉。我要继续我的工作——我要把船底的洞补上。我要铆钉。海岸那边有成箱成箱的铆钉——那么多箱——山一样堆着——箱子都要撑破了——简直要爆炸！在山腰上那个贸易站的院子里，走一步就能踢飞一个铆钉。铆钉都滚到那片死亡之林里去了。只要你不嫌弯腰麻烦，就能用铆钉装满口袋——而在需要铆钉的地方却一颗也找不到。我们有钢板，但没有东西固定它们。每周，那个形单影只的黑人信使都会扛起一个大邮袋，拿着一根棍子，从我们的贸易站出发去岸边。而岸边的大篷车每周几次载来各色贸易商品——暗无光泽的印花布，看一眼吓一跳，令人反感；一夸脱卖一便士左右的玻璃珠子；还有印着怪异圆点的棉手帕。没有铆钉。三个搬运工就可以把我需要的铆钉全部运来，让汽船再次浮起来。

他对我的态度越来越亲热，但我猜我那漠不关心的态度肯定终于触怒了他，因为他决定有必要让我知道，他连上帝或魔鬼都不怕，更何况区区一个普通人。我说我看得出来他是很勇敢的，但我想要的是一些铆钉——如果库尔茨先生知道这里的情况，他也会需要铆钉。现在每周都有人送信去岸边……‘我亲爱的先生，’他喊道，‘我的信完全是经理口授的。’我要求把铆钉送来。办法总比困难多——对于一个聪明人来讲。他的态度变得非常冷淡，突然间谈起一只河马的故事。他觉得很奇怪，为什么我能安心睡在船上（我一天到晚都守在船上）。有一只可恶的老河马，喜欢晚上爬上岸，在贸易站一带四处乱跑。那些朝圣者常常倾巢而出，把所有来复枪都找出来向它开火，直到弹药耗尽。甚至有人通宵埋伏等待它。可是他们都白费力气。‘那畜生好像受到魔法的保护，’他说，‘但在这里，只有畜生是受魔法保护的。人却没有——您理解我的意思吗？——这里的魔法是不保护人的。’他在月光下站了一阵子，把他那优美的鹰钩鼻稍稍偏过去，他那双云母片似的眼睛一直睁着，泛着光。然后，他匆匆说了声晚安，大步离去。我可以看出他动摇了，也很困惑，这些天我一直很压抑，现在终于看到了希望。甩掉那家伙后，我回到我那有权有势的靠山身旁，那条破破烂烂的、歪歪扭扭的、溃不成形的、一文不值的汽船。我吃力地爬上甲板，脚下哐啷作响，就像一个空的亨帕[21]饼干桶被人沿着下水道一路踢过去时发出的声音。她造得不够结实，外观也不够漂亮，但我在她身上付出了那么多艰辛的劳动，我无法不爱她。没哪个有权有势的朋友比她更派得上用场。她给了我一个机会，让我出去闯一闯——去发现我有什么能耐。不，我不喜欢工作。我情愿游手好闲，做做白日梦。我不喜欢工作——没人喜欢——但我喜欢藏在工作里的玄机——发现自我的机会。发现真实的自我——为自己，不为他人——其他人永远不会知道。他们只能看见肤浅的表面，永远说不清楚个中真谛。

我看见有人坐在船尾的甲板上，悬着两条腿在烂泥上方。我并不感到惊讶。你们瞧，我和站里仅有的几个技工称兄道弟，而其他朝圣者自然是不把他们放在眼里的——我想是因为他们举止不够得体。这一位是工头——负责制造锅炉的——非常称职。他个子高高的，骨瘦如柴，脸色蜡黄，一双大眼睛炯炯有神。他总是愁眉不展，头顶像我的手心一样秃，但他掉的头发好像粘在了下巴上，在新的地方开枝散叶，因为他的胡子一直垂到腰部。他是个鳏夫，有六个年幼的孩子（为了出来赚钱，他把孩子们留给一个亲妹妹照顾），他最喜欢飞鸽，那给了他生活的热情。他是飞鸽迷，也是行家，快要走火入魔了。下班后，他有时会从他的小屋走过来，和我聊他的孩子和鸽子。工作的时候，他不得不爬进汽船下面，弄得满身烂泥，他便用一块类似餐巾的白布把胡子扎起来。他特意把这块布带在身边，布的两头各有一个小环，可以套在耳朵上。晚上可以看到他蹲在岸边，在小溪里仔仔细细地把它冲洗干净，然后一本正经地摊在灌木丛上晾干。

我用力拍一下他的背部，大喊道：‘我们要有铆钉了！’他手忙脚乱地爬起来，喊道：‘不会吧！铆钉！’就像他不能相信自己的耳朵，又低声说，‘您不会……？’我不知道为什么我们俩好像得了精神病一样。我把手指放在鼻子上，神秘地点点头。‘恭喜你！’他大喊起来，在头顶上打响指，跷起一只脚。我拉他一起跳吉格舞[22]。我们在铁做的甲板上欢呼雀跃。船身发出恐怖的哐啷声，河对面的原始森林送来回声，像滚滚天雷一样，碾过沉睡的贸易站。它肯定把住在茅屋里的某些朝圣者吓得坐了起来。经理小屋的走廊亮着灯，一个黑影挡住光，又消失了，又过了一秒钟左右，走廊也消失了。我们停下来，被我们的踏脚声驱散了的宁静，又从大地深处汹涌回来。那堵草木巨墙，由无数树干、树枝、树叶和藤蔓纠缠而成，盘根错节，在月光中寂静不动，仿佛无声的生命发起了一场狂暴的侵略，一个植物的巨浪，翻得有天那么高，海啸般冲压下来，要横扫我们这些渺小的人，击碎我们渺小的存在。但它始终没有动。远方突然爆发出一阵滞闷的拍水声和鼻息声，我们听得清清楚楚，仿佛有一条鱼龙在水面嬉戏，掀起阵阵银光闪闪的浪花。‘说到底，’锅炉匠头脑清楚地说，‘怎么可能会不给我们铆钉呢？’怎么可能，的确！我也想不出为什么会不给我们铆钉。‘三周内运到。’我充满信心地说。

但并没有运到。取而代之的是一场侵略、人祸和天灾。这一切在接下来的三周里陆续袭来。每一次都是由一个骑着驴的白人带头，他穿着新衣服和黄皮靴，在高高的驴背上左一下右一下地向朝圣者们点头哈腰，让他们深受感动。一帮吵吵嚷嚷的黑人紧跟在驴子后面，他们走得腿酸脚疼，一脸阴沉，他们把一大堆帐篷、野营凳、铁皮箱、白箱子、棕色包裹扔在院子里，把贸易站弄得更加混乱，站上的神秘气氛也加深了一层。这样的商队一共来了五个，他们神色慌张，仿佛刚刚抢完无数服装店和粮食店，逃到这里来喘口气。看见他们那可笑的神情，人们当然会认为他们是要跑到没有人的荒野去安心分赃。因为商品太多而忙中生乱，实属正常，但这群蠢货却弄得这么鬼鬼祟祟，真不像样。

这帮爱岗敬业的人把自己称作埃尔多拉多探险队，我相信他们宣过誓，不能对外泄露机密的。然而，他们一开口就是下流肮脏的海盗腔：莽撞却软弱，贪婪却畏缩，残暴却胆小。他们这一大帮人都缺乏远大的目光和严肃的目标，而他们又似乎并没有意识到，要做出点成绩，这两者都是不可或缺的。他们一心只想着把财物从大地的肠子中掏出来，丝毫没有道德上的目标，跟强盗撬保险箱的行为差不多。我不知道是谁出钱资助了这一系列高尚的行动，但我们经理的叔父正好是这帮人的头目。

他的外表像贫民窟里的屠夫，眼里闪着一种昏昏欲睡的狡猾。他把大肚子架在一双短腿上，好像感到很自豪似的。在他那帮人把贸易站搞得乌七八糟期间，他只跟自己的侄子说话。叔侄两人不避嫌疑地整天四处游荡，两个脑袋紧紧靠在一起，没日没夜地密谈着。

“我已经把铆钉的事情抛开了。一个人对于那些蠢材的忍耐是有限度的。我说：去死吧！——就撒手不管了。这样一来，我获得了充足的时间来思考，时不时地，我会想到库尔茨。我也不是对他很感兴趣。并没有。但我很想知道，这个人怀揣着那些道德观念来到这里，是不是能最终爬上经理的位子，而他当上了经理之后，又会干出些什么事情来。”





第二章


有一晚，我正舒舒服服地平躺在汽船的甲板上，忽然听到有人在说话，声音越来越近——那对叔侄正在沿河散步。我重新把头枕在手臂上，正要昏昏入睡的时候，又突然听见有人在我耳边说话，说的大概是：‘我就跟个小孩儿一样天真无邪，但我不想被人指挥得团团转。我到底是不是经理？居然命令我把他送去那里。简直是疯了。’……我忽然意识到，那两人正站在船头边的河岸上，就在我脑袋下面。我没动。我压根没想过要动：我困得很。‘确实够可恶的。’叔叔咕哝着说。‘他主动向公司的领导们请求派他去那里，’另一个说，‘还不就是想要显摆一下自己的才能吗？然后他们就命令我送他去了。他们偏就这么信任他！太可怕了！’他们一致认定这非常可怕，又说了些古怪的话：‘要风得风，要雨得雨——就只他一个人——委员会——任他摆布’——这些杂乱无章的只言片语驱散了我的睡意。等我完全清醒过来，听见叔叔说：‘气候可以帮助你解决这个困难。那里只有他自己一个人？’‘是的，’经理回答，他派助手到下游来，捎给我一张纸条，上面居然写着：把这个可怜的魔鬼赶走，并且别再费事派给我这样的傻瓜了。我宁可孤身一人，也不愿意让那些听你指使的人来帮我！那是一年多以前的事情。真想不到他会这么蛮不讲理！‘’那之后还有他的消息吗？‘另一个粗声地问。’象牙，‘侄子结结巴巴地说，’很多象牙——头等的——很多——从他那里送来，真可恶。‘’和象牙一起送来的还有什么？‘粗哑的低音问。侄子好像放炮一般回答道：’发货清单。之后便是一片寂静。他们谈的，是库尔茨。

那时我已经非常清醒了，但放松躺着实在是太舒服，便一动不动，不想转换姿势。‘这么远的路，那些象牙是怎么送来的？’那个年长一些的人嘶吼着说，似乎非常苦恼。另一个解释道，是由库尔茨的贴身办事员，一个英国籍的混血儿领着一队独木舟运来的。显然库尔茨原本打算亲自把象牙运回来，贸易站那时已经既没有商品，也没有存粮，但走了三百英里后，他突然决定折回去，便自己一人坐上一条小独木舟，让四个人帮他划桨，并吩咐混血儿将象牙继续运往下游。竟然有人做出这样疯狂的举动，那两个家伙似乎大为震惊。他们无法猜测出一个合理的动机。对我而言，则仿佛第一次看见了库尔茨。那是一个如此鲜明的画面：独木舟，四个划桨的野蛮人，和那个突然之间义无反顾地把公司总部、安逸的生活和——也许——乡愁都抛在身后的白人，他是如此形单影只，执意要走入荒野深处，走向那凄荒的贸易站。我不知道他的动机。也许他不过是一个好人，他一心扑在工作上，纯粹是出于对工作本身的热爱。而他的名字，他们一次也没说出来。他是‘那个人’。而那个混血儿，据我所听到的，兢兢业业、奋不顾身地指挥了那次困难的旅程，他们却一直叫他‘那个无赖’。那个‘无赖’报告说那个‘人’有一次病得很严重——到现在也没有完全恢复……我下方的两个人随后走了开去，在不远处来回走动。我听到：‘军营——医生——两百英里——现在挺孤独的——不可避免的延误——九个月——没有消息——奇怪的谣言。’他们又走回来，经理一边说着：‘据我所知，除了那个游商之外——那个社会的害虫，只有他能从土人那里弄来象牙。’他们现在在谈论谁呢？通过这些零碎的话，我猜是库尔茨的某个手下，而且经理很讨厌他。‘如果不吊死一两个这样的家伙，以儆效尤，我们就只能一直当不公平竞争的受害者。’他说。‘当然了，’另一个咕哝道，‘吊死他！为什么不？任何事情——在这里你可以肆无忌惮地做任何事情。就是这样。你要明白，在这里，没有人可以威胁到你的职位。为什么？你受得了这里的气候——你活得比他们都要久。危险在欧洲，但在我离开那里之前，我已经尽量——’他们走了开去，交谈声变成一阵模糊的窃窃私语，然后又高起来。‘那意外的一再延误并不能怪我。我已经尽力了。’那个胖男人叹了一口气。‘很惨。’‘还有他那蛊惑人心的胡说八道，’另一个接着说，‘他在这里的时候真是烦死人了。他说，每个贸易站都应该是沿途的指路明灯，把人们引向光明。它们当然是贸易的中心，但也是开化、进步和教育的中心。真是荒唐——那个浑蛋！而且他想要当经理！不，真是——’他愤怒过度，嗓子被噎住了。我稍稍抬起头来。我惊讶地发现原来他们离我这么近——就在我下面。我都能向他们的帽子吐口水。他们盯着地面，陷入了沉思。经理用一根纤细的树枝轻轻鞭打着自己的腿，他那精明的亲戚抬起头来。‘你这次来这儿一直没生病吧？’他问。另一个吓了一跳。‘谁？我吗？哦，上天保佑——上天保佑。但剩下的人——哦，我的天！都生病了。而且他们死得太快，我都来不及把他们运走——太神奇了！’‘哼，就该这样。’叔叔咕哝道，‘啊！我的孩子，相信这个地方——我说，相信这个地方。’我看见他伸出一条粗短得像鱼鳍的手臂，挥舞着，划过眼前的森林、小溪、泥土和河流——夕阳照亮了这片土地的外表，他却似乎要凭着这样一个无耻的动作，煞有介事地向它的内心深处发出号召，想要召唤出那潜伏的死亡、隐藏的邪恶和深邃的黑暗。那情景实在太恐怖，我惊得跳起来，甩过头去看森林的边缘，好像想看看，对于他这种信赖的表示，森林会做出什么反应。面对这两个家伙，高高的森林一动也不动，报以狰狞的耐心，静待这一场狂乱的侵略自行消失。

他们不约而同地大骂起来——全然出于恐惧，我相信——然后假装不知道我在那里，转身回贸易站去。在低低的太阳下，他们肩并着肩，身子前倾，仿佛正在吃力地拖着两条可笑的影子爬坡。那两条影子，长短不一，被他们拖在身后，缓缓碾压过深深的草地，却没有压弯一片草叶。

几天后，埃尔多拉多探险队走进了那片耐心的荒野。荒野仿佛把他们吞了进去，就像大海吞掉一个潜水员一样。很久以后，我听见消息说所有的驴都死了。至于那些不及驴值钱的动物，我完全不知道他们命运如何。他们，毫无疑问，就像我们这些留下来的人那样，求得了自己应有的命运。我没有问。那时我即将要与库尔茨会面，正相当兴奋地憧憬着。我说‘即将’，是相对而言。从我们离开那条河算起，到抵达他那个贸易站下面的河边，又过了两个月。

“沿河驶往上游，就像驶回原始世界，那个草木席卷地球、大树称王的时代。空的河，无边的寂静，密不透风的森林。空气温暖、浓稠、沉重而迟滞。灿烂的阳光中，了无喜悦。长长的水道奔流向前，一路上杳无人迹，奔入远处阴惨的浓荫中。在银光闪闪的沙岸上，河马和短吻鳄并肩躺着晒太阳。水面越来越开阔，流过一个又一个绿树茂密的小岛。在那条河上，就像在沙漠里一样，极易迷路，一心想驶到水深处，却总是撞上沙洲。直到你觉得自己疯了，过去认识的一切永远也回不来了——它们在某个地方——很远——也许在另一个时空。有那么一些片刻，往事会涌上心头，就像当人完全没有时间独处的时候，会不时地想起过去的片段一样。但这些回忆像扰攘嘈杂的梦，在这个只有植物、水和寂静的世界里，在无法挣脱的现实底下，它们是如此不真实。这种生命的沉静，完全无法使人安宁。那是一股无法抗拒的力量所表现出来的沉静，笼罩着谜一样的意图。它盯着你，仿佛跟你仇深似海。后来我就习惯了，没有再看见它，因为没时间。我不得不一直摸索航道；我不得不几乎全靠直觉地去寻找河岸的蛛丝马迹；我小心翼翼地提防水底的石头；我学会了咬紧牙关，不让心脏跳出来，一个狡猾的老暗桩就能轻易划开这条破船，所有朝圣者都将掉进水里淹死；我不得不留心注意哪里有枯树，晚上去砍掉，第二天用来烧锅炉。当你不得不对付这些事情，用全副精神对付肉眼所能看见的无数琐事，现实——现实，我是说——就不见了。内在的真相总是看不见的——幸好，幸好。但我仍然能感受到它。我常常觉得它那神秘的沉静盯着我，看我在耍猴戏，就像它在盯着你们这些家伙，看你们踩在各自的钢丝上表演——表演什么来着？半克朗[23]翻一个跟头那种……”

“别说得那么难听，马洛！”一个声音咆哮道，这下我知道身边至少有一个听众还醒着。

抱歉。我忘了还要额外付一点钱，给你们拿去治心痛。其实价钱有什么要紧呢，只要把戏耍得好？你们耍得很好。我也没有耍得很糟糕，那可是我第一次指挥航行，我没让那条汽船沉掉。对我而言，这仍然是一个奇迹。试想一下，假如你们要驾驶小货车走过一条糟糕的路，却被蒙住眼睛的情景。不怕你们笑话，那趟航行着实让我大汗淋漓，浑身颤抖。毕竟，对一个海员来说，没能照顾好一个本应一直浮在水上的东西，把它的底刮穿了，简直是滔天大罪。可能没人怀疑到你身上去，但你永远忘不了那‘砰’的一声——是不是？简直就像撞在心上。你记得它，梦见它，半夜惊醒时想起它——很多年以后——浑身冷一阵热一阵的。我承认那条汽船也并没有一直浮在水上。她不止一次地蹭进了河底的烂泥里，只好请二十个食人族的生番把她团团围住，在水里噼里啪啦地往前推。这些家伙是我们沿路捎上的，给我们当水手。真不错——这些食人族——很称职。他们是工作上的好搭档，我对他们感激万分。况且，他们并没有在我们眼前你吃我我吃你：他们带了一批腐烂了的河马肉上船当食物，使得荒野的神秘气氛染上了阵阵扑鼻的恶臭。呜！我仿佛又闻到了。船上还有经理和三四个武装着棍子的朝圣者——全都安然无恙。有时我们经过岸边紧挨着未开发地区的贸易站，白人们从摇摇欲坠的小屋里狂奔而出，做着夸张的手势，表示他们是多么喜出望外以及多么盼望我们到来。他们看起来是如此的诡异——仿佛是被某个魔咒禁锢在那个地方。‘象牙’这个单词会在空中回旋那么一阵子——我们继续前进，回到寂静之中，行驶在荒凉的河道上，绕过死滞的河湾，曲曲折折地在两岸高耸的峭壁之间穿行，船尾明轮笨重地拍着水，那空洞的声音惹起阵阵回响。树，树，成千棵，成万棵，粗大的，巨大的，天一般高；在它们脚下，这一艘脏污的小汽船，紧贴着岸，逆流艰难前行，就像在巍峨的门廊下，一只迟缓的甲虫在地板上缓缓爬过。在那种情境下，人显得那么渺小和迷茫，然而那种感觉并不怎么压抑。毕竟，即使你很渺小，那只脏兮兮的小甲虫也还是向前爬着——这就是你对它的全部要求。在朝圣者的想象中，它会爬去哪里，我不知道。但我敢打赌，一定是一个有利可图的地方！对我而言，它爬向的是库尔茨——一心一意地。但后来蒸汽管开始漏水，我们爬得慢极了。一段又一段的河道在我们眼前展开，又渐渐消失于我们身后，仿佛森林不慌不忙地横穿水面，隔断了我们的后路。我们越走越深，探进了黑暗的心。那里异常安静。夜深的时候，帷幕一般的树林背后，沿河传来隆隆的鼓声，隐隐地彻夜作响，仿佛高高地在我们头顶上空盘桓不绝。这到底是战争、和平还是捕猎的鼓声，我们无从分辨。鼓声戛然而止，天地蓦然陷入一片寒冷的寂静之中——黎明即将来临。伐木工们还在沉睡，他们的篝火快要熄灭了，树枝折断的噼啪声也惊心动魄。我们是史前地球上的流浪者，流浪在一个未知的星球上，周围是全然陌生的风景。我们本可以把这片土地想象成一笔会给继承者带来厄运的遗产，而自己是第一批来接收它的人，想要征服它，必须以刻骨的痛苦和残酷的辛劳作为代价。但当我们艰难地转了一个弯，又会蓦然遇上许多草墙、尖削的茅草屋顶、一阵狂叫、许多乱挥乱甩的黑手臂、嘈杂的拍手声和跺脚声、摇摇晃晃的身躯、疯转的眼珠，在一大片低垂着，沉重得一动不动的枝叶底下。汽船就这样沿着那片阴暗而不可理喻的狂乱吃力前进。这些史前人类是在诅咒我们，在向我们祈祷，又还是在欢迎我们——谁能分辨？我们已经完全无法理解周围的环境，我们像幽灵一样飘过，充满好奇，却又暗暗恐惧着，就像神志正常的人一头撞进了疯人院里的一场暴乱。我们无法理解，因为我们已经走得太远，我们记不起来，因为我们是在原始时代的黑夜里航行，而那个时代已经一去不复返，不留下一丝痕迹——和记忆。

那片土地仿佛不属于地球。我们所习惯的地球，就像一个被制服了的怪物，被五花大绑，但那里——在那里你可以看到一个自由的怪物。那不属于地球，那里的人也——不，他们也是人。啊，你们看，那才是最糟糕的——怀疑他们也是人。渐渐地你总会怀疑起来。他们大吼大叫，乱蹦乱跳，疯狂地转圈，做出狰狞的表情，但真正令人不寒而栗的，是想到他们也有人性——跟你们一样的人性——让你们想到远古的亲属，和他们一样，狂野而暴躁，骚动不安。太丑陋。是的，丑陋极了。但如果你毕竟还是一个人，就会向自己承认，这种诚实得可怕的噪声，唤起了身体深处最隐秘的回响，令你产生模糊的怀疑，怀疑那声音包含着某种意义，某种你能够——即使离那些太初的夜晚如此遥远——能够理解的意义。为什么不？人的头脑无所不能——因为它包含了一切，包含了全部的过去以及将来。而那里面究竟有什么？喜悦，恐惧，忧伤，虔诚，勇气，愤怒——谁又知道？——除了真相——脱去了时间外衣的真相。就让那些愚蠢的人目瞪口呆、胆战心惊——真正的人自然会懂得，并一直冷眼旁观。但起码，他必须和这些岸上的人一样，也是人。他必须用真实的自己来拥抱那个真相——用他天生的力量。原则？原则不行。后天得来的一切，像衣服，不过是一块华丽的布——一扯就掉。不，你需要的是一个饱经风霜的信念。他们鬼哭神嚎，是想唤醒我吗——是不是？很好，我听见了，我也承认确实如此，但我也有想说的话，不论是好是坏，没有人能够阻止我说出来。当然了，那些战战兢兢而玉洁冰清的傻瓜是永远安全的。谁在那里嘟哝？你想知道我为什么不跳上岸，和他们一起咆哮，一起跳舞？好吧，不——我没有。你说什么？我玉洁冰清？胡说！我是没有时间。我不得不手忙脚乱地用白铅粉和羊毛毡包住漏水的蒸汽管——我忙坏了。我不得不看紧船舵，躲开暗桩，用尽一切办法让那条破烂的船往前开下去。这么明显的事情，不用比我更加聪明也看得出来。我还得时不时去盯一眼那个负责烧锅炉的野蛮人。他是一个经过改良的样本，懂得烧立式锅炉。我低头就能看见他，而且，一点不假，看着他就仿佛在看着一条狗，学人样穿着短裤，戴着羽毛帽子，用两条后腿走路，令人深受启发。这个很不错的伙计没有白受那几个月的培训。他明显是鼓足了勇气，才敢蹲在蒸汽计量仪和水位指示器前——他的牙齿被锉得尖尖的，这个可怜的魔鬼，头顶毛茸茸的鬈发剃成古怪的图案，双颊上各有三个用作装饰的疤痕。他本应在岸上拍手跺脚，但却埋头工作，仿佛被施了奇怪的魔法，满脑子都是进步的知识。他是个有用的人，因为受过训练，他只知道，如果那根玻璃管里面的水干了，住在锅炉里面的魔鬼就会因为口渴而大发雷霆，实施可怕的报复。所以他诚惶诚恐地盯着玻璃管，汗如雨下，仔细添火（他手臂上系着一个临时准备的护身符，是一块破布，另外还有一块磨得光亮的骨头，和手表一样大，打平穿过下嘴唇），而那密密丛丛的河岸慢慢从我们身边划过，岸上的吵闹声渐渐远去，又是无数英里的寂静——我们继续向前爬，爬向库尔茨。但到处都是暗桩，浅浅的河水极其凶险，锅炉里面好像真的有一个狂怒的魔鬼，所以锅炉工和我都忙得焦头烂额，没有时间仔细咀嚼心中那些恐怖的念头。

在离内地贸易站大概五十英里远的地方，我们路过一座用芦苇盖的小屋。屋子前面竖着一根歪歪斜斜的木杆，看得人心里难受，上面飞扬着碎布条，图案已经辨不清了，但依稀看得出曾经是一面旗。还有一堆码得整整齐齐的木头。真意外。我们上了岸，发现那堆木头上面有一块木板，写着褪了色的铅笔字。我们仔细反复辨认出写的是：‘木头给你们。尽快。小心靠近。’下面有签名，但看不清楚——不是库尔茨——比库尔茨的名字长得多。尽快。尽快去哪里？往上游去吗？‘小心靠近。’我们靠近时可没有小心。但这个警告说的不是这里，因为我们只有靠近了这里，才能看得见警告。上游肯定是出事了。但出了什么事——严重吗？这才是我们关心的啊！干吗写得像份电报一样啊，真够愚蠢的。周围的灌木丛默默地挡住了我们远望的视线。小屋门口挂着一张破破烂烂的红色斜纹布门帘，哀哀地打到我们脸上来。这座小屋已经荒废了，但看得出来，不久前这里曾经住过一位白人男士。屋里还放着一张简陋的桌子——用两条木棍支着一块木板，一个黑暗的角落里堆着垃圾。我在门的旁边捡到一本书。封面已经不见了，书页被翻得极脏极软，书脊却被人拿白棉线非常用心地重新装订过，那棉线还很干净。那是一个惊人的发现。这本书名叫《航海术探究》，作者是陶泽或陶森——大约是这么念的，是一位皇家海军的船长。我翻了一下，内容枯燥得要命，有许多说明性的图表和可恨的数字表格，已经出版六十年了。我极尽温柔地捧着这个神奇的古董，生怕它会在我的手里化成灰。在书中，陶森或者陶泽，热心地探讨了锚链和绞辘能承受的最大拉力和其他类似的问题。这本书并不好看，然而它那单纯的目的一目了然，是如此真心实意地在探寻工作的正确方法，使得这些卑微的书页，那么多年前的思想，不仅能给人以专业上的指导，还带来了其他启示。这位简单直率的老水手，在认认真真谈着锚链和绞辘，使我忘记了丛林和朝圣者，沉浸于一种美好的感受之中，仿佛终于找到了某些确凿不移的真实。在那里，光是这本书的存在就已经不可思议，而更令人震惊的是，页边竟然还有笔记，用铅笔做的，明显与正文相关。难道我在做梦！笔记全是用密码写的！确实，看起来跟密码似的。居然会有人费心把这么一本书带到这个荒无人烟的地方来，认真研读——还要做笔记——而且用密码！简直是天方夜谭。

有那么一阵子，我一直隐约听到一阵恼人的吵闹声。我抬起头，发现那堆木头不见了，经理和所有朝圣者都正在河边向我大喊大叫。我被迫匆匆把书塞进口袋。我发誓，当时的感觉，就仿佛被他们生生拽出了一个死党的家。

我发动破引擎，继续前行。‘肯定是这个倒霉的商人干的——这个小偷。’经理大声说，充满仇恨地回头看着我们刚刚离开的地方。‘他肯定是个英国人。’我说。‘那也不能肆意妄为，否则照样会遇上麻烦。’经理恶狠狠地说。我假装天真地评论说，人生在世，遇到些麻烦也是在所难免的。

水流越来越急，汽船似乎已经奄奄一息，船尾明轮疲倦地拍打着河面。我发现自己正踮着脚跟，全神贯注地等待下一次拍打声传来，因为我清醒地意识到，它会随时报废。那种感觉，就像看着最后的生命之光一点点消逝。但我们仍然在往前挪。有时候我会在前头不远的岸边挑出来一棵树，用来测量我们离库尔茨又近了多少，但总等不到赶上它，就忘记挑的是哪棵树了。人是不可能有耐性，做到那么长时间一直盯着同一件东西的。经理已经不失风度地退居幕后。我又苦恼又生气，开始和自己争辩，到底要不要坦诚地和库尔茨谈一次，但在我与自己达成共识之前，我就意识到，最终谈与不谈，实际上不论我做什么，都没有意义。知不知道内情又有什么关系呢？谁是经理又如何？人有时就是会这样顿然醒悟。这整件事情的关键，深藏于表面之下，我了解不到，也无从干涉。

到第二天黄昏，我们估计库尔茨的贸易站大约只在八英里开外。我想继续赶路，但经理板起脸来，告诉我继续航行太危险，太不明智，太阳快下山了，我们必须留在原地，等到第二天早上再出发。而且，他指出如果要遵从‘小心靠近’的警告，我们就应该在白天靠近——而不是在黄昏或夜里。他说得合情合理。开着这条破船，八英里要走差不多三个小时，而且前头河道上的波纹也非常可疑。然而，对于要再等一个夜晚，我莫名地感到生气。当然这很不理智，因为都等了好几个月了，再等一晚又算得了什么。既然有那么多木头，又有人警告我们要小心，我就在河中央把船停好。河道又窄又直，两岸高高地隆起来，像铁路的路堑。离太阳下山还早得很，这里就已经迫不及待地阴沉了下来。水流稳而急，但两岸一片死寂。被藤蔓绞在一起的大树尽管还活着，还有矮树丛里每一棵活着的灌木，都仿佛化作了石头，甚至连那最柔软的新枝，最轻盈的嫩叶，也冰冷僵硬。它们不是睡着了——诡异得仿佛灵魂出了窍。四周是一片全然的寂静，人害怕地睁大眼睛看着它们，渐渐怀疑自己聋了——然后黑夜突然降临，又把人砸瞎了。大约凌晨三点，一条大鱼纵身跃出水面，噼里啪啦的水声刺耳得像枪声，吓得我跳了起来。日出时，升起一团极暖极湿的白雾，比黑夜更浓稠，凝滞着，死死赖在那里，紧紧包围住你，牢不可破。等到大约八九点钟，它就像一扇百叶窗一样，渐渐上升消散。我们又能够看上一眼那些参天大树，缠成一片的乱林，太阳悬在上空，像一个炙热的小球——全部都纹丝不动——然后那扇白色的百叶窗又迅速地稳稳落下，好像滑下一个上满润滑油的滑槽。我命令把刚刚收上来一点的锚抛回去。锚链还在钝重地嘎嘎响着，突然传来一声惊叫，叫得山崩地裂，仿佛从无尽的凄凉里喊出来，在灰暗的空气中缓缓飞升。它停了，然后是一片哀怨的吵闹声，混在野蛮人古怪的喧哗里。仅仅是因为猝不及防，我帽子里的头发就全部倒竖起来。我不知道别人对此有何感想：这场凄惨凌乱的骚动是如此突然，而且明显从四面八方同时爆发出来，我觉得就像是那片迷雾本身在惊叫。这场骚动突然进入高潮，爆发出一声震耳欲聋的尖叫，戛然而止。我们惊讶得呆若木鸡，在原地保持着各种可笑的姿势，仍然固执地想要在可怕得过分的寂静里听出点什么声音来。‘善良的上帝啊！这是在干什么——’我身边一个朝圣者结结巴巴地说——他矮胖，黄发红须，穿着绑边靴子和粉红色的睡衣，裤腿塞进袜子里。另外两个朝圣者张着嘴巴发了整整一分钟的呆，然后冲进小小的船舱，又跌跌撞撞地跑出来，站定了，恐惧地左顾右盼，紧紧攥住‘上好膛’的温彻斯特步枪。我们能看见的只有汽船，她的轮廓模糊地淡进雾里，仿佛随时要融掉，还有她周围那雾茫茫的狭长水道，大约两英尺宽——就这么多。凭我们的耳目，无法感知到余下的世界。也许耳目之外根本就了无一物。逝去了，消失了；被吹散了，了无声息，了无踪影。

我跑向船头，命令立刻拉紧锚链，以便随时起锚开船。‘他们会袭击我们吗？’一个恐惧的声音轻轻地说。‘我们逃不出这片雾，他们会把我们全部杀掉。’另一个含糊不清地说。朝圣者们的脸因为紧张而抽搐，手微微战抖，眼睛一眨不眨。我饶有兴味地拿这些白人的表情和黑人水手做比较。对于这段河流，黑人水手和我们一样陌生，尽管它距离他们的家只有八百英里。这些白人当然是心乱如麻，还因为被一阵如此野蛮的吵闹声惊吓到而倍感痛苦，露出古怪的表情。黑人则带着警惕，自然流露出对事情表示关注的神情，但他们几乎都是一脸平静，甚至有那么一两个人在收锚链的时候竟然在笑。其中几个相互简短地嘟哝了几个词语，似乎这阵吵闹声就得到了妥善的解释。他们的头领是一个年轻健壮的黑人，郑重其事地披着用流苏镶边的深蓝色衣服，鼻孔大得吓人，头发全被熟练地编成油汪汪的发卷。他正好站在我身边。‘啊哈！’我点点头说，只是为了表示友好。‘抓住他！’他厉声说，睁圆发红的眼睛，锋利的牙齿寒光闪闪——‘抓住他。把他交给我们。’‘给你们干什么？’我问，‘你们要对他做什么？’‘吃了他！’他粗暴地说，把一只手肘抵在栏杆上，望进浓雾中，表情凝重，仿佛陷入了庄严而深邃的沉思。要不是突然想到他和同伴们肯定已经饥肠辘辘，我肯定会被吓个半死：至少在过去一个月里，他们的饥饿感一定与日俱增。他们的聘期是六个月（我想在他们这些人里，没有一个对时间有明确概念，正如无数个世纪前的我们一样。他们还生活在混沌的原始时代——可以说，没有继承到任何可供学习的经验。），当然了，在河的下游，有人制定了某项荒唐的法律，只要根据它签好合同，没人会费心过问这些黑人在这段时间里吃的是什么。他们确实是带了一些腐烂的河马肉，但就算那些朝圣者没有为此大吵大闹，把它们扔进河里，那么点肉也吃不了多久。朝圣者们这么做当然有点专横跋扈，但确实也可算作合法自卫。试问如果你不论是睡是醒，还是在吃饭，都要闻着死河马的气味，又怎么能够分出神来，在险境里保全性命？况且他们每周付给这些黑人三根铜丝，每根大概长九英寸。从理论上讲，黑人们可以用这些货币在河边的村庄购买食物。结果很明显。要不就没有村庄，要不就是村民极不友善，又或者是那个跟我们一样天天吃罐头，偶尔还能吃到公羊肉的经理，举出某个难以解释的理由拒绝停船。所以，除非他们直接把铜丝吃掉，或者做成环来捉鱼，我看不出这笔高得离谱的薪水有什么用。我不得不说，薪水按时支付，倒是大贸易公司的做派，极守信誉。剩下唯一能吃的东西——尽管看起来完全无法下咽——我只看见他们有几团紫色的脏东西，像半熟的面团，包在树叶里保存，不时拿出来吞一块。但每一次都吃得那么少，好像只是在做样子，根本达不到维持生命的目的。他们为什么没有借口说受不了饥饿魔鬼的折磨而袭击我们——他们是三十对五——并马上吃个痛快呢？我到现在也想不明白。他们高大强壮，不懂瞻前顾后，勇武有力，尽管那时他们的皮肤不再像原先那么光洁，肌肉也松弛了。我看出了某种东西在约束着他们，阻止了这个完全有可能发生的行为，那是人性的奥秘之一。我看着他们，兴趣暴增——不是因为我醒悟到随时会被他们吃掉，尽管我承认，在那一刻我忽然发现——可以说是以全新的目光——那些朝圣者看起来是多么倒胃口，而我希望，是的，我确实希望，自己看起来不是——怎么说才好呢？——那么——令人难以下咽：这小小的虚荣心，实在是异想天开，不过我当时整日都处在半梦半醒的状态，有这种想法也不奇怪。也许我还有点发烧。人不可能一直对自己的生活状态明察秋毫。我经常‘有点发烧’，或其他什么小毛病——荒野调皮地伸出爪子抓了人一下，虽然无关痛痒，却是空前浩劫的前奏。是的，我盯着他们，和盯着任何其他人类时一样，带着好奇心，想知道在遇到肉体无法承受的考验时，他们的冲动、动机、能力和软弱将如何表现。约束！有什么能约束得住他们？是迷信、厌恶、忍耐、恐惧——还是某种原始的道义？恐惧敌不过饥饿，忍耐拖不垮饥饿，厌恶在饥饿面前总是荡然无存，至于迷信、信仰，或是你们所说的原则，也不过是风里的浮尘。你们知道吗？无休无止的饥饿有多么残忍，把人折磨得怒火中烧，产生阴暗的念头，而它只是黑压压地盘旋不去，简直是丧心病狂。啊，我可是知道。它使人穷尽天生的力量去抗争。丧亲之痛、身败名裂之耻和灵魂之毁灭真的算不了什么——与这种没有尽头的饥饿相比。多么可悲，但事实就是如此。这些家伙也完全没有必要像俗世里的人一样感到良心不安。约束！我还不如在一条奔向战场撕吃尸体的鬣狗身上找自我约束。但我面前明摆着一个事实，看得人眼花缭乱，像深海上浮泛的泡沫，像谜团表面的蛛丝马迹——海一样深的谜团。那片野蛮的号叫声，从河边传来，隔着看不穿的白雾，叫得如此悲哀绝望、离奇古怪和不知所云，在我们身边席卷而过，其中含义已经足够神秘，但每当我想起这个事实，还是觉得它要比这种含义神秘得多。

有两个朝圣者着急地低声争辩着应该往哪边靠岸。‘左边。’‘不，不，你别乱来。右边，右边，毫无疑问！’‘情况严重，非常严重，’经理的声音从我身后传来，‘要是库尔茨先生在我们到达之前有什么闪失，剩我一个人孤零零的可怎么办？’我盯着他，对他的真心实意毫不怀疑。他就是那种力求保全大局的人。那是他自我约束的表现。但当他嘟嘟囔囔说什么必须马上开船的时候，我简直懒得理他。我知道，他也知道，那是不可能的。要是我们拉起锚，绝对会飘起来——飘上天，我们就不知道会飘去哪里——去上游还是下游，或是横着飘——直到我们在这边或者那边靠岸——并且一下子不知道是在左边还是右边靠的岸。我当然没有起锚。我不想撞船。没有比那里更不适合发生沉船事故的地方了。就算不马上淹死，也会眨眼间以某种方式死掉。‘我准许您冒一切风险开船。’他在片刻沉默之后说道。‘我拒绝冒任何风险。’我粗鲁地说。他早料到我会这么说，但可能我的语气还是吓到了他。‘既然如此，我必须尊重您的决定。您才是船长。’他客客气气地说。我转过身去背向他，以表感谢。我看着浓雾。它会持续多久？越看越绝望。库尔茨在这片凄凉的丛林里搜掠象牙，要找到他真是危险重重，就好像他是中了魔咒的公主，沉睡在一个童话的城堡里。‘他们会攻击我们吗，您觉得？’经理用信赖的语气问。

我觉得不会。有几个明显的原因。浓雾是一个。如果他们坐独木舟离岸，在雾里肯定找不着北，就像我们现在轻举妄动的结果一样。而且，据我判断，两岸的森林密不透风，他们走不出来——可树林里有许多双眼睛，早已看见了我们。河边的丛林一定异常稠密，但那些土人显然能够穿过丛林后面的灌木丛。然而，雾散那片刻，在这整条河道上都看不见独木舟——更别说在汽船两侧。但真正使我深信他们不会攻击的，是那片声音的本质——我们刚才听到的那片喊叫声。它不够凶猛，并没有传达出马上要发动进攻的意图。尽管它是如此突然、粗野和残暴，我却不得不承认，它给我的印象是哀伤的。那些土人一瞥见汽船，不知怎的，内心就充满了无法抑制的哀伤。危险，如果有的话，我解释说，那是由于我们接近了喷薄而出的人类激情。甚至极端的悲伤，最终也可能通过暴力发泄出来——但多数时候，它只是表现为死一般的冷漠……

真想让你们看看那些朝圣者瞠目结舌的表情！他们笑不出来，甚至也懒得骂我胡说，但我相信他们认为我疯了——也许是认为我被吓傻了吧。我煞有介事地对他们发表演讲。我亲爱的伙计们，担忧没有用。保持密切注意？好吧，你们能想象我当时有多么全神贯注地在寻找雾散的迹象，就像猫在伏击老鼠那样。但我们仿佛被深深埋在几英里厚的羊毛里一样，要眼睛来又有什么用！而且我也感觉像被埋在羊毛里一样——窒息，闷热，喘不过气来。再说了，我说的每一句话，尽管听起来有点荒诞不经，却丝毫不假。后来被我们称作攻击的那次行动，其实也只是想把我们赶走。那次行动远算不上攻击——甚至从一般意义上说，也不是防御性的：仅仅是绝望中本能的挣扎，本质上纯属自卫。

我想，雾散了之后，大约过了两三个小时，事态才有所进展。转机出现在距离库尔茨的贸易站大约一英里半的地方。我们刚刚费尽九牛二虎之力转过一个河湾，看见河流中央有一个小岛，或者说不过是一个小土丘，覆满了鲜亮的绿草。似乎是一个小孤岛，但当我们沿河深入，我发现原来有一条很长的沙洲，这个小岛是沙洲的起点。又或者说，它是一长串小浅滩的起点。这些小浅滩颜色暗淡，刚好被水没过，正像人的脊梁骨，在后背的皮肤底下隐约可见，直直地排下去。那时，根据我看见的情况，我可以选择在沙洲的左边或者右边行驶。两边的河道对我而言当然都是陌生的。河岸看起来根本没有区别，深度看起来也一样，但既然有人告诉过我贸易站在西边，我自然选择了西边的河道。

我们刚开进去，就发现这边的河道比预想中狭窄得多。我们左边是那条连绵不绝的沙洲，右边是又高又陡的河岸，灌木丛生。灌木丛上方是密密地排成一列列的大树。河道上空垂下厚密的枝叶，不时地，某棵树的大树枝横伸出来，冷冷地挡住前进的路。正午已经过去了好几小时，森林面目幽沉，向水面投下了一大片长长的阴影。我们在这片阴影里前行——你们也想象得到有多么举步维艰。我把她转向岸边，贴岸行驶——探测杆测出岸边的水最深。

我的一位朋友就在我脚下的船头处测量着水深，他虽然饥饿难耐，却也不急不怨。这条汽船恰像一艘安上了甲板的平底船。甲板上有两间带门窗的小柚木房子。锅炉在船头，引擎在船尾，几根柱子撑起一个轻而薄的顶棚，罩住整个甲板。烟囱伸出顶棚，烟囱跟前是用薄木板搭成的一个小船舱，用来做驾驶室。驾驶室里有一张沙发，两张轻便折凳，一杆装了弹药的马蒂尼-亨利步枪斜靠在角落里，此外还有一张极小的桌子，以及舵轮。正前方开了一扇大大的门，两侧各有一扇宽阔的百叶窗。当然了，门窗平时总是大开着。白天我高高地坐在驾驶室门前的顶棚边缘，晚上我睡在沙发上，或者说在沙发上努力入睡。一个黑人，体格健壮，行动敏捷，来自某个岸边的部落，由我那位可怜的前任培训过，现在当舵手。他戴着一副扎眼的黄铜耳环，一幅蓝布从腰一直裹到脚踝，总是摆出一副不可一世的样子。在我见过的傻瓜中，他最为反复无常。你在他身边的时候，他掌起舵来总是信心十足，昂首挺胸，但如果他看不见你，立刻变得手忙脚乱、无所适从，被那瘸子一样的汽船欺负得失魂落魄。

我低头盯着测深杆。每测一次，杆子便往上露出一些，让人心焦火燎。这时我看见我的测水工突然擅离职守，伸直了身子躺在甲板上，甚至连杆子都来不及拉上来。但他并没撒手，杆子垂在河水里，随波摇荡。与此同时，那位锅炉工，在我视线所及的下方，在他的锅炉前面猛然抱头坐下。我悚然一惊。接着我不得不火急万分地把目光转到河面上，因为前头有一个暗桩。棍子，小棍子，密密地飞来——铺天盖地：飕飕地飞过眼底，掉在我脚下，扎进我身后驾驶室的墙。而在这期间，这条河，河岸，森林，都一直非常安静——死一般的安静。我只听得见船尾明轮钝重的拍水声和这些棍子的噼啪声。我们狼狈地绕开了暗桩。箭，啊！有人在向我们放箭！我冲进去把朝岸的百叶窗关上。那个笨舵手，紧握轮辐，高抬双膝，狂暴地踏着脚，嘴里咯咯作响，仿佛一匹被勒疼的马。真可恶！船已经离岸不到十英尺，而且笨拙难行。我被迫马上探身出去拉上那扇笨重的百叶窗，蓦地看见在浓密的树叶里有一张脸，正好与我的脸一样高，在定定地盯着我，目露凶光。然后，突然间，好像垂在我眼前的薄纱猛然被掀开，我看到，在乱枝缠结的暗林里，涌动着赤裸的胸膛、手臂、腿和熊熊燃烧着的眼睛——丛林里密密麻麻地挤挨着乱扭乱动的人体，那青铜色的皮肤上，油光乱闪。树枝在摇，在晃，在沙沙作响，乱箭从里面疾飞而出，然后百叶窗合上了。‘直着往前开。’我对舵手说。他定定地昂着头，脸朝前，但不断转动眼睛。他一边继续掌舵，一边重复着抬起双脚又轻轻放下，嘴里微微冒着白泡。‘不许动来动去！’我怒火中烧地向他说。我还不如去命令风里的树不要摇来摇去。我冲出驾驶室。下方的铁甲板上传来人心惶惶的脚步声和惊慌失措的喊叫声。一个声音尖叫道：‘求你把船往回开！’我看见一个V字形的水纹，就在前头水面上。什么？又是暗桩！下层甲板上传来一阵枪声。朝圣者们用温彻斯特步枪开火了，但他们这样做毫无杀伤力，完全是浪费铅弹。霎时间一阵浓烟滚滚，缓缓前移。我对着烟骂了几声。现在水纹和暗桩都消失了。我在门边窥视着，箭蜂拥而至。它们可能淬了毒，但看起来连猫也杀不死。丛林开始咆哮，伐木工们仿佛上了战场一般大喊大叫起来。有人就在我身后开枪，把我的耳朵都要震聋了。我回过头去，发现驾驶室里仍然翻滚着浓烟和吵闹声，连忙向船舵冲过去。那个愚蠢的黑人什么都不管了，甩开百叶窗，举起马蒂尼-亨利步枪向窗外乱射。窗口就那么大开着，他站在那里双眼发红，我狂喊他回来，一边匆忙扭转船舵，让走歪了的船驶回来。即使我想掉转船头，空间也不够了，障碍物近在眼前，隐没在那阵迷乱的烟里。刻不容缓，所以我把船一头扎向岸边，我知道那里水深。

我们慌慌张张地紧贴着岸边的灌木丛走，把伸到河上的枝叶撞得四散纷飞。下方的枪声突然停了，就像我之前预计的一样，因为子弹很快就会射光。我猛然把头向后一甩，躲过一支嗖的一声闪过驾驶室的箭，看着它从一边窗口飞进来，又从另一边飞出去。那个舵手好像疯了，挥舞着空膛的来复枪，向岸边狂喊乱叫。越过他往窗外看，有许多模糊的人影，弓着身子奔跑着，跳跃着，滑行着，若隐若现。突然，百叶窗前飞来一个巨物，来复枪掉进了水里，舵手猝然后撤几步，扭过头来，用一种怪异、深邃又熟悉的表情看了我一眼，倒在我的脚上。他头的同一侧两次撞上舵轮，我看见一根不知道什么东西，仿佛是长棍的尾段，四处噼啪乱撞，还撞翻了一张小凳子。看起来就像他从岸上某人手里把这根棍子抢了过来，却因用力过猛失去了平衡。已变薄的烟散开了，我们躲开了暗桩。往前望，我预计再前进一百码左右就可以自由地驶离河岸。我忽然发觉双脚又湿又热，连忙低头看。这个男人翻过身来，脸朝上直直地盯着我，双手紧紧握住那根棍子。那是长矛的柄，那长矛也许是被扔进窗口，也许是直戳进来，正好插穿了他肋下的腰部。矛头撕开了一个骇人的裂口，深深插了进去，已经看不见了。我的鞋子里满是血，船舵下面也死寂地漫着一摊黑红色的血，隐隐闪着光。他的眼睛泛着奇异的光泽。新一轮的枪声又爆发了。他焦灼地望着我，紧紧抓住长矛，仿佛它价值连城，我要把它夺走似的。我花了很大力气才挣脱了他的目光，把注意力重新放到驾驶上来。我腾出一只手来，在头顶上摸到汽笛的绳子，匆忙地一次又一次拉响汽笛。那片愤怒的喧闹声和喊杀声骤然停止，紧接着从树林深处传来一阵哀号，如此悲恸震颤，如此幽怨不绝，透着凄切的恐惧和彻骨的绝望，仿佛要跟随大地上最后一丝希望杳然逝去。灌木丛里一片骚动。箭雨停了，几支余箭的声音尖锐刺耳——然后又是一片死寂。在寂静中，船尾明轮那无精打采的拍水声清晰可闻。我重重地把舵向右转过去，那个朝圣者，穿着粉红色睡衣，满脸通红，狂躁不安，来到驾驶室门前。‘经理让我来——’他拖着官腔，才开口便停住，‘老天爷！’他说，直直地注视着那个伤者。

我们两个白人在旁边俯视着他，他的眼睛闪闪发光，那探求的眼神紧紧包裹着我们。我敢肯定，那眼神看起来就像他立刻要用一种听不懂的语言向我们发问，但他一言不发地去世了，一动不动地，连肌肉的抽搐也没有。只有在最后一刻，好像要回应某个我们看不见的信号，或是某声我们听不见的低语，他深深地皱了一下眉头，使他那张死去的黑脸带着一种奇异的表情，忧郁，幽深，险恶。那双眼里隐含探求之意的光辉转瞬即逝，只留下荒凉的虚空。‘你会开船吗？’我急切地问这个传话人。他一脸迟疑不决，但我紧紧抓住他的手臂，他马上明白我是在命令他去开船，不管他会不会。实话告诉你们，我急得发疯，一定要马上换掉鞋袜。‘他死了。’那个家伙深感震惊，喃喃地说。‘用不着你说，’我说，狂乱地扯开鞋带，‘而且，我猜库尔茨先生现在也已经死了。’

一时间我满脑子只想着这件事。我感到绝望透顶，好像发现了自己一直为之奋斗的东西根本只是海市蜃楼。要是我走这么远的路，只是为了和库尔茨先生谈谈，此时此刻我自然应该气恼得无以复加。和他谈谈……我把一只鞋从甲板上扔下去，开始意识到那正是我想要的——和库尔茨先生谈一次话。很奇怪，我发现自己从没想象过他在做什么，我一直只是在想象他在说什么。我没有对自己说‘现在我永远见不到他了’，或者‘现在我永远无法和他握手了’，而是‘现在我永远听不见他说话了’。他只是作为一个声音而存在。当然，在我的脑海里，他并非无所作为。难道人们不是带着各种嫉妒或溢美的口吻对我说，他搜刮、拿货物换来、诈骗或是偷了很多象牙，比所有其他代理人找到的象牙加起来还要多吗？但这不是重点。重点是，在他各种过人的天分之中，尤其鹤立鸡群，让人无法视而不见的，是他说话的能力，他的如珠妙语——那天赋极高的字句，既蛊惑人心，又烛照人心，既极为冠冕堂皇，又极为下流可耻，宛若跃动的光流，又宛若一连串的谎言，从那片密不可破的黑暗的心中流淌而出。

“我死命地把另一只鞋子也扔进河里。我想，天啊！全完了。我们走得太慢，他已经消失了——连带着他的天赋，因为某根长矛、某支箭或某根大木棍。我到底还是永远听不到那个家伙说话了——我感到悲伤，悲伤得毫无节制，歇斯底里，跟这些在灌木丛里哀号的土人一样地情感失控。就算我的信仰崩溃，就算我忽然生无可恋，也不可能感到更加悲凉，更加孤寂……为什么这么粗鲁地叹气，是谁？觉得这很荒唐吗？荒唐就荒唐吧。我亲爱的上帝！难道人就不能——来，来点烟丝。”……

他沉默了，黑夜陷入深不见底的寂静之中。然后他划着一根火柴，火光映出他的脸，瘦削，苍老，凹陷，皱纹向下坠，眼睑也向下坠，带着一副凝神冥思的表情。他贪婪地吮吸着烟斗，那张脸在忽明忽灭的焰光里，在夜色中反复地出现、消失。火柴灭了。

“荒唐！”他喊道，“这种事，怎么讲你们都不会理解……你们，这里的每一个人，都有两个安稳的归宿，就像一艘有两个锚的船，街头有肉铺，巷尾有警察，你们食欲旺盛，体温正常——听好了——从年头正常到年尾。而你们说，荒唐！说我荒唐——简直是胡说八道！荒唐！我亲爱的孩子们，对于一个刚刚因为紧张过度而扔掉了一双新鞋的人，你们能指望他有什么样的表现？现在想起来，我真惊讶自己当时竟然没有哭出来。我，总的来说，为我的坚强倍感自豪。想到已经永远无法听到天赋过人的库尔茨向我侃侃而谈，错失了千载难逢的好机会，我感到痛彻心扉。我当然是伤心错了。那个机会仍然静候着我。是的，而且我后来都听厌了。我也知道了自己是对的，一个声音，他仅仅是一个声音而已。我也听到了——他——它——这个声音——其他的声音——所有的都只不过是声音——那段时间的记忆在我身边缠绕不去，难以捉摸，就像一片庞大的闲谈声渐渐低了下去，只剩死滞的余音，愚蠢，恶劣，卑鄙，野蛮，或者说是赤裸裸的下流，毫无任何意义可言。只是声音，声音——甚至连那个姑娘本身——啊——”

他沉默良久。

“最后，我撒了一个谎，超度了他那阴魂不散的天赋。”他突然又开始说起来，“姑娘！什么？我提到一个姑娘了吗？哦，她是局外人——完全是。她们——我是指女人们——是局外的——而且也不应该牵涉进来。我们必须帮助她们安心留在自己那个美好的世界里，以防她们把我们的世界变得更糟糕。哦，她不应该被牵涉进来。我们把库尔茨从地狱里拉上来的时候，他还在念念不忘着‘我的未婚妻’。这样你们就该知道她有多么清白。还有库尔茨那高耸的额头！他们说有时候头发会重新长出来，但这个——啊——样本，却秃得干净彻底。荒野轻拍过他的头，然后，瞧，它就变得像个球一样——一个象牙球；荒野轻抚过他，然后——看！——他就此凋谢。它攫住他，爱他，拥他入怀，潜入他的血管，吃净他的肉，通过某种邪恶得不可思议的入会仪式，把他的灵魂牢牢地据为己有。他被它宠坏了，成了它最娇纵的宠儿。象牙？我想确实如此，有成堆的象牙，堆成山的象牙，多得把那间老旧的泥棚屋都要挤爆，多得让人不禁觉得，不论是在那片土地的上面还是下面，都再也找不出一根象牙来了。‘都差不多要变成化石了。’经理曾经轻蔑地说过。那些象牙并不比我更枯朽，但只要是从地里挖出来的象牙，他们就称作化石。看来这些黑人的确会偶尔把象牙埋进地里——但明显他们埋得不够深，未能阻止天资过人的库尔茨先生身受此厄运。船舱装不下这么多象牙，我们只好把剩下的堆在甲板上。这样一来，只要他还能睁开眼睛，就可以继续含情脉脉地欣赏它们，他对这些珍宝的爱惜赞赏之情至死不休。你们真该听听他说的‘我的象牙’。哦，是的，我听见了。‘我的未婚妻，我的象牙，我的贸易站，我的河流，我的——’什么都属于他。听得我屏息静气，等着听到荒野爆发出天崩地裂的狂笑声，响亮得可以震落满天的星星。什么都是他的——但那是不要紧的，要紧的是他是谁的，又有多少股黑暗的力量宣称自己享有他的所有权。思考这个问题简直令人不寒而栗。答案是无法想象的，尝试去想象它也对人毫无好处。他在那片大地的众多魔鬼之中窃据高位——我并无夸张。你们理解不了。你们怎么能理解？——脚下踩着坚固的人行道，四周围着一群友好的邻居，时刻准备着给你们鼓劲儿，或是在背后议论你们，你们优雅地往返于肉铺和警察之间，对闲言碎语、绞刑架和精神病院心怀圣洁的恐惧——你们又怎么能够想象，一双没有枷锁的脚能把一个人带到属于太初时代的什么鬼地方去？这双脚走的是一条凄荒的路——彻底的凄荒，连警察的影子都看不到——这双脚走的是一条死寂的路——彻底的死寂，听不到任何一个善意的邻居低声地警告你们人言可畏。这些细节毫不起眼，却造成了天壤之别。当它们消失，人就必须求助于自身天生的力量，求助于自己坚持某种信念的能力。当然你们可能已经愚蠢到失去了犯错误的能力——甚至迟钝到意识不到自己正在被那些黑暗的力量攻击。我想，没有哪个傻瓜曾经拿自己的灵魂去和魔鬼讨价还价：是因为傻瓜太傻，还是魔鬼太坏——我不知道，又或者是因为，你们是圣洁得如此惊天地泣鬼神，以至于除了天国的景象和声音，你们都充耳不闻，熟视无睹，而地球对你们来说只是个立脚之处——做这样的人，对你们而言是得是失，我不想妄加评论。但绝大部分的人，既不属于前者，也不能归为后者。地球，是我们的家，我们不得不忍受这里的各种景象、声音，还有气味，天啊！——比如说，忍受死河马的气味——而又竭尽全力地独善其身。这时，难道你们还没有发现吗？你们的力量起作用了，你们坚信自己有能力挖出毫不起眼的洞穴，把这些不得不忍受的东西全都埋进去。那是一种驱使你们献身的力量——不是献给你们自己，而是献给某个说不清道不明，却又令人心力交瘁的事业。这已经够难了。注意，我不是在找借口，更不是在申辩——我只是在尝试让自己理解——理解——库尔茨先生——库尔茨先生的幽灵。这个幽灵，从虚空的深处浮现出来，接受过文明的熏陶，在它彻底消失前，竟对我产生了惊人的信赖，使我受宠若惊。这都是因为它能用英文跟我交流。未变质前的库尔茨，有一部分教育是在英国接受的，而且——他本人直白地说过——他从不曾滥用他的同情。他的母亲有一半英国血统，父亲则有一半法国血统。整个欧洲都为库尔茨的横空出世贡献了力量。我后来还慢慢了解到，破除野蛮传统国际协会还曾经委托他撰写一个报告，用作日后的工作指南，真是知人善任。而他也已经写好了。我看见过。我读过。这个报告雄辩滔滔，激动人心，但我觉得它未免有点杯弓蛇影。他竟然挤得出时间来写完一份十七页的报告，而且每页都密密麻麻地写满了字！但这肯定是在他——这么说吧——发疯之前写的，为此他还跑去主持一些午夜舞会，这些舞会的落幕仪式恶劣得令人不齿，它们——把我在不同时间听到的只言片语拼凑起来，我发现——是在祭祀他——明白吗？——祭祀库尔茨先生本人。但那个报告写得确实漂亮。然而，开篇第一段，鉴于我已然知悉后事如何，现在想起来，竟是谶语。他劈头就抛出一个论断，说我们白人，依照目前的发展水平，‘在其（野蛮人）眼前，须作为超自然之生物而存在——吾等身附神力，翩然下凡’，等等，等等。仅凭简单训练，吾等即可向其行使实无约束之有益特权”，等等，等等。以此为起点，他天马行空地写下去，把我也蛊惑住了。整篇报告写得雄壮艳丽，只是很难让人记住具体写的是什么。我觉得它散发着由神圣的慈悲生出的广博气度，看得我心潮澎湃。这就是滔滔雄辩那股脱缰野马一般的力量——华辞丽藻的力量——那些灼灼欲燃的辞藻，如此高尚，如此力量无穷！全篇报告一气呵成，其间并无任何务实的文字冒出来，截断行云流水一般的佳词妙句，除却写在末页页脚的一条注释。这条注释明显是在报告写成多时之后，由一只颤抖不已的手写上去的，不妨将它看作是对某个方法的说明。它异常简短，却在这篇感人得足以唤起人们利他主义情怀的报告末尾闪着强光，炫目，骇人，就像划破宁静天空的一道闪电：“斩绝土人！”令人不解的是，他显然把这条宝贵的附注忘得一干二净。因为，过后，当他略微恢复意识，便三番四次地恳求我要小心保管好‘我的小册子’（他这么叫它），好像未来它绝对能为他的事业增光添彩。我对所有这些事情了如指掌，并且，事实证明，后来我也不得不尽心尽力地捍卫他的身后美名。在这一点上，我已经仁至义尽，完全有权利决定它[24]的命运。只要我愿意，我就可以把它扔进人类发展进程的垃圾桶，让它永远安息在所有的牺牲品，以及人类文明中诸多湮没无闻的著作之间。但那时，唉，我身不由己。他已经被刻进了人们的记忆里。无论如何，他不是一个凡夫俗子。他有力量诱惑或恐吓蛮荒之民为了向他表示崇敬而发狂似的大跳巫舞，他也能够让朝圣者们为了他终日深锁愁眉。他至少拥有一个忠实的朋友，征服了这个人的灵魂，那既非原始野蛮，亦非见利忘义的灵魂。不，我忘不了他，尽管我并没有足够的证据来断言，为了把他找回来，我们牺牲了一条生命到底值不值得。我发疯一般地想念我那刚去世的舵手——甚至当他的尸体还躺在驾驶室里，我就已经在想念他了。也许你们会认为这不可理喻，我竟然会想念一个土人，他比撒哈拉沙漠里的沙子更不值一提。可是，请你们想想，他也做了点事情，他有掌舵。几个月来他一直陪在我身后——一个帮手——一件工具。他是我的伙伴！他帮我掌舵——我不得不时刻盯住他，我担心他因为能力不足而犯错，于是在我和他之间，生出了一种微妙的联系，而当它蓦然断裂，我才恍然大悟。在他受伤时投向我的目光里，有一种亲密的深邃，至今仍历历在目——仿佛在最重要的时刻，宣布了我们在久远的时代里，确曾血脉相连。

可怜的傻瓜！他为什么不离开那个百叶窗呢！他控制不住自己，控制不住——就像库尔茨一样——只是一棵任风摆布的树。我一换上一双干的拖鞋，就把他拖了出去。我当然是先把矛从他身侧拔了出来——我承认我在这么做的时候，紧紧闭着眼睛。过门槛时，他的两只脚后跟一起跳了一下，他的双肩死死压着我的前胸，我从背后拼命抱住他。天啊！他很沉，很沉，我觉得他比地球上任何一个人都要沉。然后我毫不迟疑地把他扔进河里。水流马上攫住他，就好像他是一缕水草。我看见尸体翻了两圈，便永远地消失了。那时所有朝圣者以及经理都团团围在驾驶室四周，像一群兴奋的喜鹊一般说个不停。我听见一阵窃窃私语，说我冷血，竟然毫不迟疑地把尸体扔掉。他们把尸体留下来有何用，我猜不着，也许是要对它做防腐处理吧。然而，我也听见从下面甲板传来的另一阵窃窃私语声，令我毛骨悚然。我的朋友，那些伐木工，对我的行为同样不满，而他们的理由更加充分——尽管我承认那个理由本身实在是超乎寻常。唉，实在是太过分！我横了心，如果我那刚去世的舵手一定要被吃掉，能吃他的也只有鱼。他生前是一个二流的舵手，现在他死了，却可能变成众人趋之若鹜的宝贝，说不定会引起一场轩然大波。而且，我正急于回去自己掌舵，因为那个穿着粉红睡衣的男人看起来笨拙得令人绝望。

那场简单的葬礼一完，我就马上回去掌舵。汽船稳稳地在河流的正中央半速前进，我可以分神去听他们在怎么说我。他们抛弃了库尔茨，他们抛弃了贸易站，库尔茨死了，贸易站被烧成灰烬——等等——等等。那个红毛的朝圣者，大概以为我们至少为库尔茨报了夺命之仇，竟发了疯一般狂喜不已。‘喂！我们肯定把丛林里的敌人杀了个落花流水，是不是？多么了不起！你们说是不是？是不是？’他竟真的跳起舞来，这个嗜血成性的小丑！这时候他倒活蹦乱跳的，刚才看见那个受伤的男人时，他却差点昏过去！我忍不住说：‘说真的，你们制造出来的那一大团烟雾还真够了不起的。’从灌木丛顶部的沙沙声和摇晃程度来看，我当时就知道几乎所有的子弹都打高了。要想击中目标，必须瞄得够准，并把枪架在肩上开火，这些家伙却把枪顶在了盆骨上，开枪的时候还要闭着眼！土人们之所以撤退，我坚持说——而且我是对的——是因为汽笛的尖叫声。一听见我这么说，他们马上把库尔茨抛开了，愤愤不平地冲着我大喊大叫以示抗议。

经理站在船舵旁，鬼鬼祟祟地在我耳边低声说，天黑前无论如何要远远地离开这里，逃到河流下游去。此时我看见远处河边有一小块空地，上面隐约有几座建筑物的轮廓。‘这是什么？’我问。他惊讶地拍拍手。‘就是那个贸易站！’他喊道。我保持半速，马上把船向岸边驶去。

我从望远镜里看到一个小山坡，坡上一株灌木也没有，只有零零落落的几棵树。坡顶有一座长条形的房子，破败暗淡，深埋在高高的乱草中。尖尖的屋顶上大洞满布，远远看去像是大张着一个个黑色的嘴巴。房子背后，是一片凌乱的丛林。四周没有围栏，也没有篱笆。但显然曾经有过类似的东西，因为在房子旁边，仍然立着一排细长的木柱，大约有一打左右，粗粗修剪过，顶端还装饰着雕花圆球。栏杆，或是木柱之间任何别的什么东西，已经杳然无踪了。当然，那一切都被森林簇拥着。河岸空旷开阔，我看见一个白人站在水边，戴着一顶车轮一般的帽子，使劲儿向我们挥胳膊。细察森林边缘的上下方，我几乎可以肯定里面有动静——有人在走来走去。我万分谨慎地驶过森林，熄灭引擎，让船自行顺水而下。水边的人开始朝我们大喊大叫，催我们上岸。‘刚才有人袭击我们！’经理向他喊道。‘我知道——我知道，不要紧的！’那个人回喊，欢乐得无与伦比。‘过来吧，没关系的！我太高兴了！’

看见他，我想起之前见过的某样东西——我在某处看见过，很滑稽的。我一边驾船靠岸，一边喃喃自语：‘这个家伙到底像什么呢？’我猛然记起来了。他像个戏剧里的丑角。他的衣服原来很可能是棕色的，用荷兰亚麻布制成，但现在满是补丁，夺目的补丁，蓝色的，红色的，黄色的——背后有，前面有，肘上有，连膝盖上也有，外套的镶边色彩斑斓，裤腿的流苏猩红鲜艳。沐浴在阳光下的他，看上去如此欢欣若狂，又如此惊人的光鲜整洁，因为你能清清楚楚地看见，这些补丁无一例外地缝得巧夺天工。一张白皙稚气的脸，胡子刮得干干净净，五官都很平淡，鼻子正在掉皮，一双蓝眼睛小小的。在这张率真的脸上，颦笑交相追逐，就像风吹过的平原上交替出现的阴影和阳光。‘小心，船长！’他喊道，‘这里昨晚打进去了一个暗桩。’什么？又有暗桩？我承认我骂了很难听的话。我差点就捅穿了这艘破船，立刻了结这趟令人走火入魔的旅程。岸上的丑角把他那个像哈巴狗一样的小鼻子抬起来冲着我。‘您是英国人吗？’他满面春风地问。‘那你是吗？’我站在船舵边向他喊道。他马上沉下脸，摇摇头，好像在对我的失望表示歉意。接着他重新快活起来。‘管他呢！’他欢欣鼓舞地喊道。‘我们没来晚吧？’我问。‘他在那上边。’他回答，头朝山上一甩，脸上瞬间堆满愁容。他的脸就像秋日的天空，阴晴不定。

那些全副武装的朝圣者前呼后拥着经理朝那座房子走去的时候，这个家伙跑到甲板上面来。‘听我说，我现在感到很不自在。丛林里藏着那么多土人！’我说。他热切地向我保证绝对不会出乱子。‘他们都很笨。’他又说，‘你们来了我真高兴，我一天到晚都要提防着，不让他们跑出来。’‘但你刚才说没关系！’我叫起来。‘是的，他们不会伤害人。’他说。我直直地盯着他，他改口说：‘也不完全是这样。’接着又快活地说，‘说真的，你们的驾驶室真该好好打扫打扫了！’紧接着，他建议我在锅炉里保存足够的蒸汽，万一遇到任何麻烦，可以马上拉响汽笛。‘汽笛尖叫一声，比你们所有的来复枪都见效。他们都很笨。’他重复道。他就这样喋喋不休地说个不停，简直不给我开口说话的机会。他似乎是太久不曾和别人说话了，现在要好好补偿一番。事实上，他也笑着暗示道，实际情况就是如此。‘你怎么不跟库尔茨先生说话？’我说。‘你不跟他说话——你只听他说，’他喊道，口吻带着庄重的赞叹，‘但现在——’他摆摆手，转眼间陷入了深不见底的沮丧中。过了一会儿，他忽然跳到我面前，抓住我双手使劲儿地晃，一边急促含混地说：‘水手兄弟……荣誉……愉悦……欢乐……自我介绍……俄国……大司祭的儿子……坦波夫[25]政府……什么？烟丝！英国烟丝！上好的英国烟丝！真是好兄弟！抽不抽烟？哪有不抽烟的水手？’

他抽了烟，平静下来。我渐渐了解到，他逃学出来，上一艘俄国船出了海，后来又逃走了，在英国船上工作过一段时间，现在已经跟他的大司祭父亲和好如初。他特别强调了这件事。‘但人年轻的时候，就是要去开开眼界，累积经验和想法，使自己更加见多识广嘛！’‘来这里开眼界？’我打断他。‘您是不知道！在这里，我遇到了库尔茨先生。’他郑重其事地责备我说，真是年少轻狂。此后我便闭口不言。似乎他在成功说服一个陆上的荷兰贸易公司为他提供补给品和货物之后，便毫无顾忌地深入荒野。他像个婴儿一样，根本不去想自己可能遭遇什么。他独自一人在那条河上流浪了差不多两年，与一切人和事断绝了联系。‘我并不像看上去那么年轻，我二十五岁了。’他说。‘开始的时候，老范·修登总是让我滚开，’他兴高采烈地叙述道，‘但我一直没放弃，缠着他谈啊谈啊，谈到后来，他害怕我真的能把死人说活了，就给我一些便宜货和几杆枪，让我永远不要再来见他。他是个老好人，那个荷兰人，范·修登。一年前，我托人给他送了一小批象牙，这样等我回去的时候，他就不好意思再叫我小偷了。希望他已经收到了吧。其他的事情我一点儿也不在乎。我给你们准备了一堆木头。那座是我从前住的房子，你们看到了吗？’

“我把陶森的书还给他。看他的样子，简直是要吻我，但他克制住了。‘我就剩下这么一本书了，还以为丢了呢。’他说，喜不自胜地盯着它，‘独自流浪的人总有旦夕祸福。有时候小船会翻掉——有时候惹怒了那些土人，就只好落荒而逃。’他翻开书。‘你用俄文做笔记？’我问。他点点头。‘我还以为是密码呢。’我说。他笑了，接着突然严肃起来。‘我费了很大劲儿才把这些人挡在外面。’他说。‘他们想要杀死你吗？’我问。‘不！’他喊道，然后紧闭双唇。‘他们为什么攻击我们？’我继续问。他迟疑片刻，然后羞怯地说：‘他们不想他走。’‘他们不想吗？’我惊诧地说。他讳莫如深地点点头。‘请您听好了，’他喊道，‘这个人让我豁然开朗！’他张开双臂，那双小小的蓝眼睛盯着我，睁得又大又圆。”

我两眼发直地盯着他，惊讶得茫然无措。我面前的这个人，穿着花团锦簇的衣服，好像刚刚从一个哑剧团里逃了出来，依然充溢着铺张的热情。他的存在虚幻、诡异，完全是莫名其妙的，没有道理可讲。你根本无法想象他的人生是怎么样的，他竟然能够成功穿越千山万水至此，而且活了下来——他竟然没有立刻烟消云散。‘我往前走几步，’他说，‘又再走几步——突然有一天，我发现已经走得太远，找不到回头的路了。管他呢。反正我还年轻。我能活下去。您赶紧把库尔茨带走——赶紧——听我的。’他浑身上下都散发着青春的光辉，包裹住他花枝招展的破衣服，他的贫困，他的孤独，以及那份与徒劳无功的流浪形影相随的寂寞，蚀骨的寂寞。月复一月——年复一年——朝不保夕的岁月。他之所以依然能够在那里无畏无惧地活着，从不思前想后，全因为他年轻气盛，不知深浅。我不禁有点欣赏起他来——甚至有点嫉妒他。正是这种青春的光辉在催促他前行，并护佑着他。他当然对荒野别无所求，他要的只是能够让他自由呼吸和一往无前的空间。他只想活下去，走下去，不惜身犯险境，不惜困蹇无依。如果一种纯洁无瑕、毫无心计而不求实利的冒险精神确曾支配过一个人，那一定是这个花衣青年。我禁不住要嫉妒他，他身上竟燃烧着一股如此谦逊而纯粹的精神。它仿佛耗尽了他所有能够用来关注自我的精力，如此彻底，甚至当他还在跟你说话的时候，你便已经忘记了，正是他——眼前这个人——经历了这一切。不过对于他无限景仰库尔茨一事，我一点儿也不觉得有什么好嫉妒的。他对此确实有欠深思熟虑。库尔茨闯入了他的生命，他便带着狂热的宿命感，为他倾倒。我真的觉得，那是他生平所有的遭遇中最凶险的事。

他们终于不可避免地相逢了，就像风止住后，两艘共同随水浮荡的船，终于擦碰在一起一样。我想，库尔茨先生一定是需要一个听众，因为当他们某次在森林里扎营的时候，曾经彻夜交谈，当然更可能的是库尔茨在说，他在听。‘我们无所不谈，’他说，谈起那个夜晚，依然满心激动，‘我都忘记了人还要睡觉。整个夜晚似乎还没有一个小时那么长。我们无所不谈，无所不谈！……还谈到了爱。’‘什么？他和你谈爱情！’我十分感兴趣地说。‘您别想歪了，’他血脉贲张地喊道，‘是那种笼统意义上的爱——他令我茅塞顿开——茅塞顿开。’

他高高地举起双臂。我们那时在甲板上，那个无所事事地坐在一旁的伐木工工头抬起头来看他，一双深邃的眼睛碎光流转。我环顾四周，不知怎的，但我向你们保证，这片土地，这条河，这片森林，这熊熊燃烧着的苍穹，在我看来如此绝望，如此黑暗，如此深不可测，对人类的弱点如此无情。‘这么说，你们从此当然是形影不离了？’我说。

事实正好相反。看来总有各种各样的原因中断他们的交往。他自豪地告诉我，库尔茨生过两次大病，都是在他的精心看护下才挺了过来（听他的口气，好像那是多么惊心动魄的丰功伟绩），但库尔茨行动的时候，照例是不带其他人的，总是孤身深入密林。‘想见他的时候，我就到这个贸易站来，但往往要等上很多很多天才能等到他。’他说，‘啊，但他值得等！——有的时候。’‘他去干什么了？探险吗？’我问。‘当然是了。’他发现了很多村庄，还有一个湖呢——其实他也说不清楚它们的确切方向。太好奇总是危险的——但他去探险，主要还是为了找象牙。‘但那时他手里已经没有货物了，拿什么换象牙呢？’我抗议道。‘但他还剩下很多弹药。’他回答道，转过脸去。‘你就把话说穿了吧，他就是在四处抢劫吧？’我说。他点点头。‘他肯定不是唯一一个这么干的人！’他吞吞吐吐地说了一些关于沿湖村庄的事情。‘库尔茨令那个部落对他唯命是从，是不是？’我暗示道。他有点窘迫。‘他们对他佩服得五体投地。’他说。他说这些话的声调奇怪得很，我不禁用锐利的目光看着他。他是如此热切地想要谈论库尔茨，却欲言又止，实在古怪之极。这个库尔茨，已经渗透他生命的每个角落，支配了他的思想，操控着他的感情。‘不然你想怎么样？’他爆发了，‘他带着雷鸣和闪电降临到他们面前——他们从来没有见过这种东西——真是太可怕了。他可以变得非常可怕。库尔茨不是普通人，不能用平常的标准来评判他。不，不，不！现在——我只是想让你知道——我不介意告诉你，他有一天连我都想射死——但我不会去评判他。’‘射死你！’我喊道，‘为什么？’‘因为，我有一点象牙，是我房子附近村子的首领给我的。我过去常常帮他们打猎的。他想据为己有，无论如何要据为己有。他正颜厉色地说，我必须把象牙给他，然后迅速离开那个地方，否则就要一枪杀了我，因为他可以这么做，并且也很想这么做，在这个地球上没有什么可以阻止他杀死任何想杀的人。他也说得没错。我把象牙给他了。有什么要紧！但我没有走。不，不，我离不开他。不过当然，我必须处处小心，直到时过境迁，我们重归于好。那时他再次病倒。等他好了，我只好避开他。但我毫不介意。他一般住在河边的村庄里，偶尔到河边来，有时候也会和我说说话，而有时候我还是谨慎一些比较好。这个人受了太多的苦。他也痛恨这一切，但不知怎的就是无法抽身。一有机会，我就恳求他尝试一下，赶在无可挽回之前离开。我还主动提出请他带我一起回去。他会说好，却依然我行我素，然后又出发去别的地方找象牙，一连消失好几个星期。他混在这些人中间，连自己是谁都忘掉了——忘掉了自己是谁——唉。’‘天啊！他这是疯了！’我说。他愤怒地否认。库尔茨先生是不会疯的。要是我听过他谈话，即使只是在两天前，也不敢这么随便地下判断……我们一边说着话，我已经拿起了望远镜朝岸边看，扫视楼房两边和背后的森林边缘。那片丛林，死一般沉默，死一般安静——沉默安静得就像山上那座黯败的房子一样，然而却有人潜藏在内——意识到这一点，我感到不寒而栗。这个骇人的故事并没有在这片荒野里留下丝毫痕迹，它的细节，也不曾被言明，我几乎完全是通过那一声声凄凉的呼喊，一次又一次的缩背耸肩，七零八落的字句，一遍遍伴随着长叹的闪烁其词，靠自己想象出来的。岿然不动的树林像一个面具——像紧闭的狱门一般，沉重得仿佛一直在往下坠——这些树木，仿佛无所不知，无限耐心，凛然难侵，静静地看着这一切。这个俄国人又向我说，库尔茨先生不久前刚来过河边，随身带着那个湖边部落的所有战士。他之前又消失了几个月——我想他是去显灵了吧——后来却突然回到这儿来，一副想要向河对岸或下游发动袭击的架势。显然，他对象牙的渴望压过了——怎么说呢——那些稍嫌不够务实的志向。然而他的身体突然垮掉了。‘听说他倒在这里，没人照顾，我就来了——想着趁机再劝他一次。’俄国人说，‘唉，他很不好，太不好了。’我把望远镜转向那座房子。它看起来已经完全荒废了，只有残败的屋顶，长长的泥墙从荒草堆里探出来，上面张着三个大小不同的正方形小窗洞：从望远镜里看去，仿佛这一切都触手可及。然后我猛地一转，望远镜里蓦然出现了一根木桩。篱笆朽坏了，木桩却残存了下来。你们还记得吗？我刚才说过，远远地望见这些木桩上的雕花圆饰时，我是多么的惊讶。在这片废墟里，竟然有人挣扎着要镂金描彩！现在它突然来到眼前，吓得我猛然把头向后一甩，就像要躲开迎面而来的一拳。然后我缓缓地一个木桩一个木桩看过去，发现之前我没看真切。这些圆球并不是装饰，而是饱含象征意义的，它们意味深长，却又莫名其妙，骇人又恶心——引人思考，也能引来正在空中鸟瞰觅食的秃鹫，但最终总不免被那些不畏辛劳地爬上木桩的蚂蚁享用。要不是脸朝那座房子，它们，那些木桩上的人头，本可以更加震撼人心。只有一个，我辨认出来的第一个，面朝着我。我并没有像你们所想的那么大惊失色。我之所以向后猛然甩头，完全是吃惊时的条件反射。我本来是想着会看到一个木球的嘛。我故意回头去看那第一个——就是它，又黑又干又皱，双眼紧闭——一个人头，仿佛在木桩上沉沉睡去了，而那干巴巴的嘴唇萎缩起来，窄窄地露出一线牙齿的白色，仿佛在笑，在止不住地笑，仿佛正在做着一个永不醒来的梦，一个令人忍俊不禁的梦。

我可没有泄露商业机密。事实上，后来经理说库尔茨先生所用的手段对那个地区而言是毁灭性的。对这个观点，我没有什么想法，但我真的希望你们能够理解，把那么多人头插在木桩上根本毫无益处。它们只能表明库尔茨先生对自己的各种欲念束手无策，表明他缺乏某件东西——不是什么了不起的东西，然而每当欲念冲昏了他的头脑，在他的滔滔雄辩里却无论如何找不到它。他本人是否意识到这个缺陷，我不知道。我想他最后肯定有所醒悟——只是大限已至。但荒野一早就看透了他，对他那异想天开的侵略，进行了残忍的报复。我想，荒野一定曾经向他耳语，告诉他他所不知道的事情，关于他自己的秘密，告诉他，在他受教于这片无边的凄凉荒野之前无从想象的事情——事实证明，这些低语对他有着致命的诱惑力。它们在他身体里放肆地回响着，因为他已然只是一个空空如也的躯壳……我放下望远镜，那个离我近得几乎可以和它喁喁私语的人头似乎立刻跳了开去，消失在遥不可及的远方。

库尔茨先生的这位信徒有点沮丧。他仓促含混地絮叨起来，想要让我相信他确实不敢把这些——嗯，标志——取下来。他不害怕本地的土人，库尔茨不点头，他们不敢胡来。他犹如天神下凡。这些土人密密麻麻地围绕在库尔茨的住处四周安营扎寨，首领们每天前去问安。他们会伏在地上……‘不要告诉我他们觐见库尔茨先生的时候要行什么礼。’我喊道。很奇怪地，我浑身上下毛发倒竖，感觉这个细节比库尔茨窗外那些在木桩上慢慢风干的人头更容易令人失控。毕竟，那只是一个野蛮的画面，然而我那时却仿佛觉得自己被送到一个一片漆黑的地区，到处弥漫着隐约的恐惧，在那里，坦白纯粹的野蛮本性对人而言是一种安慰，因为它有权利——理直气壮地——存在于光天化日之下。这个年轻人目瞪口呆地望着我。我猜他没有想到，我可一点儿也不崇拜库尔茨。他忘了，我从未听到过那些天花乱坠的演讲，那些关于，关于什么来着？关于爱，公正，为人之道——诸如此类——的演讲。如果让他伏在库尔茨脚边，他肯定顺服之极，一点也不输给那些最野蛮的人。我不知道当时发生了什么，他说那都是谋反者的人头。我忍不住狂笑起来，把他吓坏了。谋反者！下一次他们又会被叫作什么？我已经听到过敌人、罪犯、工人——而现在这些又成了谋反者。木桩上那些图谋不轨的人头，在我看来温柔和顺。‘你怎么能够想象，这样一种生活对像库尔茨先生这样的人来说有多么残酷！’库尔茨的最后一个信徒喊道。‘对你而言，也一样的残酷？’我说。‘我！我！我是个笨蛋。我只是井底之蛙。我对其他人一无所求。你怎么能拿我和……？’汹涌的感情把他噎住，忽然之间，他崩溃了。‘我真是不明白，’他痛苦地嘟哝道，‘我拼尽全力，只求他能活下去。对这一切，我一直置身事外。我无力插手。这么多个月了，这里连一滴药水，一口能给病人吃的食物都没有。他被抛弃了，多么可耻啊。把这样一个人抛弃了，这样一个满怀着高尚思想的人……可耻！可耻啊！我——我——我已经一连十天十夜无法合眼……’

在宁静的暮色里，他的声音渐渐飘散如烟。在我们说话的时候，森林那长长的影子早已泻下了山坡，漫过那堆断垣残壁，漫过那排充满着象征意义的木桩。那一切全笼罩在阴暗之中，但我们在下面，仍然是金阳如水。河边空地对着的河道流光溢彩，却又沉静宁谧，而上下游的河湾都已隐没在冥漠的暮色之中。岸上一个人也没有，那片丛林也没有沙沙作响。

突然，一群人从那座房子的边上簇拥而出，仿佛蓦地从地里钻了出来似的。他们紧紧挨在一起，穿过齐腰深的荒草，中间抬着一个临时草草做成的担架。在这片刚才仿佛空无一人的荒野中，平地响起一声尖叫，凄厉刺耳，就像一支利剑划破宁静的空气，直直刺进了这片土地的心脏。紧接着，跟变魔术似的，无数的人——裸体的——手执长矛、弓和盾，目露凶光，行为粗野，从那片阴郁凝重的森林里呼啸而出，涌进了河边的空地。丛林瑟瑟作抖，草丛也随之震颤，然而一切很快又复归平静，重新摆出一副凝神静思的姿态。

‘现在，要是他不发话救我们，我们就别想活了。’紧挨着我的俄国人说。这伙抬着担架的人本来朝着汽船走来，此刻也停下脚步，好像被石化了一样。我看见担架里的人坐起身，瘦骨嶙峋的他，举起一条细长的手臂，从抬着担架的那丛肩膀上，高高地探了出来。‘这个人能把笼统的爱谈得如此美妙动人，现在让我们看看他能不能举出个高明的理由来救活我们吧。’我说。我对这个令人困惑的险境有一种说不出的厌恶，好像我现在不得不向那个邪恶的幽灵摇尾乞怜似的，实在是有失身份。我什么都听不见，但通过望远镜，能看到那条干瘦的手臂在发号施令似的挥舞着，那个下巴在动，那个幽灵的眼睛透着寒光，深深陷在枯槁的头颅里，那个头一点一点的，仿佛正在抽搐，可笑之极。库尔茨——库尔茨——在德文里是‘短促’的意思——没错吧？名如其人，他生得匆忙——也死得急促。他看起来至少有七英尺高。盖在他身上的布已经滑了下来，露出身体，可怜，可怕，仿佛滑下来的是一块裹尸布。他那鸟笼一般的肋骨起伏着，他手臂的骨头涌动着。他多么像一个活了过来的死神雕像，用古老的象牙雕成的，正在向一群一动不动的青铜人偶，黑乎乎、亮闪闪的人偶，咄咄逼人地不停挥着手以示威胁。他张大了嘴——那副表情看起来古怪又贪婪，仿佛他想把眼前的一切全部吞进去，所有的空气，所有的泥土，所有的人。我隐约听到一个阴沉的声音，他肯定是在咆哮。突然他又倒了下去。那些人抬着担架继续蹒跚前行，担架在他们肩上摇来晃去。几乎与此同时，我注意到那一大群土人不动声色地撤回森林中去，仿佛那片突然把他们吐了出来的森林，现在长吸一口气，又把他们吞了回去。

担架后面跟着几个朝圣者，他们拿着他的武器——两杆猎枪，一杆沉重的来复枪，一把轻型左轮手枪——这些就是那个朱庇特的雷电，真够寒酸的。经理挨着他的头走着，向他弯下腰去耳语了几句话。他们把他安置在一个小小的船舱里——小得仅仅放得下一张床和几张小折脚凳那种。我们把那些未能按时送到他手里的信件带来了，现在他的床上散满撕破的信封和展开的信。他用虚弱的手在这些纸中间寻摸着。他那炙热的眼神仿佛正在燃烧，然而他疲倦的面容却沉静如冰，我不禁吃了一惊。他并不是因病萧索，看起来也并不痛苦。这个幽灵一脸满足安详，仿佛如今的它已经尝遍人间所有的酸甜苦辣、喜怒哀愁。

他沙沙地摩挲着其中一封信，直直地盯着我的脸说：‘很高兴见到您。’一直有人在给他写信，向他推荐我。又是那时流行的推荐信。他毫不费力就能声如洪钟地说出话来，几乎都不需要费事去动动嘴唇，真是太惊人了。一个声音！就是这个声音！低沉，深邃，震天动地，然而这个人看起来却已经如此有气无力。可是，他残存的力量仍然足以——当然已是强弩之末——把我们逼入绝境，我马上就会讲到。

经理悄无声息地出现在门廊里。我马上走出去，他一把拉上我身后的门帘。朝圣者们充满好奇地看着那个俄国人，他正凝视着岸边。我随着他的目光看过去。

远处，隐隐约约地有些灰黑的人影在森林昏暗的边缘晃来晃去，河边有两个青铜色皮肤的人，倚着高高的矛，站在阳光中，戴着用布满斑点的兽皮做成的奇异头饰，严阵以待，岿然不动，仿佛两座雕塑。在洒满了金色阳光的岸边，一个狂野豪放、艳光四射的女人，幽灵一般，沿河从右往左走着。

她稳稳迈着脚步，身披垂满流苏的彩纹布，昂然地踩在泥土上，一身蛮俗的饰物叮咚作响，灿然生辉。她高高地昂着头，头发盘成一个黑盔。她缠着及膝高的古铜色绑腿，手臂上套着金黄色的铜钏儿，黄褐的脸颊上描了一块猩红色，脖子上挂满了玻璃珠子项链。种种狰狞的物件，符咒，巫师的赠礼，垂在她身上，每走一步都光摇影颤。她这一身装束，肯定值好几根象牙。她野蛮却美艳绝伦，狂暴却辉煌富丽。她从容的步子，既含着不祥之感，也透着庄严之气。在忽从天降，笼罩住这片哀土的寂静里，无涯的荒野那肥沃而神秘的身躯，生灵涌动，仿佛正在凝视着她，沉吟不已，仿佛那就是它自己的灵魂，变幻莫测，却热情汹涌。

她走到汽船前面，面朝我们站定。她长长的影子拖进河里。她的表情忧伤而凶狠，原始的悲哀，滞闷的痛苦，以及由蠢蠢欲动却难以坚定的决心所带来的恐惧，一团乱麻般纠缠在一起。她纹丝不动地站在那里盯着我们，就像荒野的化身，那神态仿佛在筹划着某个险恶的阴谋。过了整整一分钟，她才向前迈了一步，浑身沙沙轻响，黄色的金属流光溢彩，缀满流苏的彩布飘拂摇漾。她没有再前进，仿佛心痛得无法动弹。我身旁的年轻人咆哮起来，朝圣者们在我背后嗡嗡地交头接耳。她盯着我们所有人，仿佛全靠这坚如磐石的目光，她才得以保全性命。忽然间，她张开裸露的双臂，高高举在头上，一动不动，好像被无法抑制的渴望攫住，歇斯底里地想要触碰天空。与此同时，阴影迅疾地包裹上来，遮暗了河面，把汽船也裹入怀中。牢不可破的寂静沉沉地笼罩下来。

她缓缓转身离去，沿着河岸继续走，走进左边的丛林里。只有一次，在她即将要融进昏冥的丛林时，回眸看了我们一眼。

‘要是她要上船，我恐怕要向她开枪。’那位浑身补丁的男士心惊肉跳地说，‘过去这两周，我拼了命才把她挡在屋外。可后来她还是进来了，大吵大闹，责怪我把储物间里那点子破布拿去补我的衣服。我也有点按捺不住。我肯定回击了，因为她发了疯一般对着库尔茨大喊大叫足足有一个小时，还不时狠狠地指着我。我听不懂这个部落的方言。好在那天库尔茨大概是病得太难受，没精神理她，不然真不知道怎么收场。我真不明白……不——真是够呛。唉，现在总算结束了。’

这时帘后传来库尔茨深沉的声音：‘救我！——你要救的是那些象牙吧。别跟我扯这个。救我！为什么？我之前不也被迫救过你一命吗？你这是在破坏我的计划。生病！生病！我还没像你们希望的病得那么重！不要紧，我不会放弃我的计划——我会东山再起。咱们走着瞧。你，还有你到处兜售的那些蠢主意——你这是要拆我的台。我会卷土重来的。我……’

“经理出来了。他纡尊降贵地挽着我的手臂，把我拉到一边，真是意外的荣宠。‘他情绪很低落，非常低落。’他说。他觉得有必要唉声叹气一番，但忘了同步地装出悲伤的样子。‘我们对他已经仁至义尽，不是吗？但不必讳言，库尔茨先生对公司而言已然弊大于利。他估计错误，现在动武，时机还不成熟。谨慎再谨慎——那是我的原则。我们还要继续谨慎下去。我们对这个地区暂时还无能为力。多么不幸！总体而言，公司的贸易利益必将受损。我不否认他获得的象牙数量惊人——但大部分都朽坏了。无论如何，我们必须把它们拯救出来——但您看，我们现在的处境是多么凶险——为什么？因为他使用了龌龊的手段。’‘你，’我望着河岸说，说那是”龌龊的手段？‘’还有什么疑问吗，‘他愤怒地高声说道，’难道您不认为是这样吗？……

‘那根本谈不上是什么手段。’过了一会儿，我低声说道。‘确实如此，’他兴高采烈地说。‘这种局面我早就预见到了。这充分说明他缺乏判断力。我有责任向有关方面汇报这一情况。’‘哼，’我说，‘那个家伙——他的名字是什么来着？——那个制砖商，会帮你把那份报告写得精彩绝伦的。’他惊讶得哑口无言了好一阵子。他简直是污染空气，我从来没有感到如此窒息过。我在精神上走投无路地倒向了库尔茨，但求解脱——确实是但求解脱。‘然而我认为库尔茨先生是一个卓绝不凡的人物。’我咬牙切齿地说。他吓了一跳，冰冷阴沉地白了我一眼，静静地说：‘他以前是。’便转过身去背对着我。我就这样失宠了。我发现自己转瞬之间变成了库尔茨的同党，盲目地赞成使用那个时机不成熟的手段：我是多么龌龊！啊！但起码我自己选择了要做的噩梦是哪一个。

事实上，我是倒向了荒野，而不是库尔茨先生。坦白讲，我觉得库尔茨等于已经被埋掉了。而有那么一会儿，我感觉自己也仿佛被埋在一个巨大的坟墓里，和许多令人不齿的秘密一起。好像有什么在压迫着我的胸膛，沉重得无法忍受，我闻到潮腐的泥土味，所向披靡的腐败无形无迹，却又阴魂不散，我能看见的，只有看不穿的暗夜，一片漆黑……俄国人拍拍我的肩膀。我听见他在口齿不清、结结巴巴地说着什么‘同行兄弟——纸是包不住火的——我知道一些会败坏库尔茨先生名声的事情’。我没有打断他。对他而言，库尔茨先生明显还没有被埋掉。我怀疑在他看来，库尔茨先生是长生不死的。‘说吧！’我最后说，‘没关系！正巧我也是库尔茨先生的朋友——从某种意义上说。’

他讲了一大堆冠冕堂皇的开场白，说什么要不是看在我们是‘同行’的分上，他将誓死对我守口如瓶。‘他怀疑这些白人对他不怀好意——’‘你说得没错。’我说，想起无意中听到的那次谈话。‘经理想绞死你。’乍一听到这个情报，我觉得还挺可笑的，但他却显得忧心忡忡。‘我最好不声不响地离开，’他郑重其事地说，‘我现在对库尔茨已经没有什么用处了，他们很快就会随便找个借口把我赶走。还有什么可以阻止他们呢？离这里三百英里就有一个军营。’‘既然如此，’我说，‘要是你在附近有土人朋友，也许你最好尽快去投奔他们。’‘有很多，’他说，‘他们都很单纯——反正我也无求于他们。’他咬着唇站着，又说：‘我不希望这里的白人受到任何伤害，但当然我更为关心的是库尔茨先生的名声——但您是我的同行兄弟，因此——’‘别担心，’我过了一会儿说，‘我会好好保全库尔茨先生的名声。’我自己也不知道，说这句话有几分是出于真心实意。

他压低声音对我说，正是库尔茨先生命令向汽船发动攻击的。‘有时他想到有人要把他赶走，就满心怨恨——那时就是……但我想不明白这些事情，我的头脑太简单。他以为那能把你们吓跑——你们会以为他已经死了，就知难而退。我阻止不了他。唉，最近这一个月真是太折磨人了。’‘现在好了，’我说，‘他没事了。’‘也许——是吧。’他咕哝道，明显还有几分怀疑。‘谢谢，’我说，‘我会小心注意的。’‘记得不要说出去——好吗？’他紧张地恳求我，‘要是这里有人——他可就身败名裂了。’我极其严肃地向他发誓，保证只字不提。‘有一只独木舟和三个黑人兄弟在等着我，就在这附近。我这就走。你能给我一些马蒂尼-亨利枪的子弹吗？’当然没问题，我赶紧偷偷给了他一些，没有人注意到。他向我眨眨眼，不问自取地从我那里抓了一把烟丝。‘咱们可是好兄弟——多么棒的英国烟丝。’他刚走到驾驶室的门口，又转过身来——‘喂，你有没有多余的鞋子？’他把一条腿抬起来。‘看。’他拿几根打满结的绳子把鞋底捆在光脚下面，跟穿着草鞋似的。我翻出一双旧鞋来，他美美地看了一眼，就把它塞进左边腋下。他许多口袋中的一个（红得发亮的）被子弹绷得鼓鼓的，另一个（暗蓝色）塞着《陶森格物录》，其他口袋也装满了东西。他似乎认为自己这身装备已经无懈可击，完全可以再去与荒野缠斗一番。‘啊，我将永远，永远不会再遇到这样一个人了。你真该听听他的诗朗诵——而且他告诉我那是他自己写的诗！他会写诗啊！’回想起这些快乐的时光，他的眼里泛起幸福的光彩。‘啊，他使我豁然开朗！’‘再会。’我说。他和我握握手，走进凄迷的夜色之中。有时候，我不禁问自己，我到底是否真的见过他——世间到底有没有这样一个奇人呢！……

刚过午夜，我猛然醒来，想起他的警告。这个夜晚繁星点点，那个警告里暗示的危险，越想越真实。我赶忙起身四处走动，看看有没有什么风吹草动。山上有一个大火堆，明明灭灭地照出贸易站大楼一个塌陷了的角落。一个代理人带着船上的几个黑人正在巡逻，手持武器，把守着那些象牙。而在森林深处，红光闪烁不定，仿佛躲在一堆漆黑的乱柱后面，忽而蹿出地面，忽而又逃回地底。库尔茨的信徒们就驻扎在那里，忐忑不安地彻夜守望着。满耳都是单调的鼓声，滞闷沉重，震颤不绝。树林像一堵漆黑平滑的墙，背后有很多男人绵绵不绝地自顾自念着某种怪异的咒语，那声音好像从蜂巢里传出来的嗡嗡声一样，听得半梦半醒的我昏昏欲睡。我想我一定是倚在汽船的栏杆上睡着了。一阵平地惊雷一般的嘶吼声，仿佛是某种诡异的愤怒之情在久遭压抑之后突然爆发，把我惊醒了，我在迷糊中有点手足无措。嘶吼声戛然而止，只剩下那低低的嗡嗡声，仿佛是听得见的寂静，让人心下安然。我下意识地朝小木屋扫了一眼。屋里点着一盏灯，但库尔茨先生不见了。

如果我当时相信了自己的眼睛，一定会当即尖叫一声。但我一开始真的无法相信它们——那种事实在是太离奇。实际上，我被吓坏了，这种恐惧毫无内容，纯粹是恐惧本身，与有形的切身危险一点关系也没有。这种感情之所以如此排山倒海——我该怎么说？——是因为我受到了精神上的震撼，好像有人把某种狰狞可怖的东西，不堪细思，令人本能地厌恶的，突如其来地塞进我的怀里。这当然只是转瞬即逝的感觉，紧接着涌上来的，是那种普通的危机感，也许致命的危险近在咫尺，突袭和大屠杀随时可能爆发，诸如此类的，都是燃眉之急。然而，这种感觉真的舒服得多。我迅速镇静了下来，实际上，它的效果是如此明显，以至于我没有高声发出警报。

有一个代理人，穿着一件阿尔斯特宽大衣，把扣子扣得严严实实，睡在甲板上一张椅子里，距离我不到三英尺。那阵喊叫声没有吵醒他，他鼾声细细。我没有扰他清梦，兀自跳上了岸。我没有出卖库尔茨先生——这是上天的命令——我选择了这个噩梦，这是我的命。我迫不及待地要与这个幽灵单打独斗——直到今天，我也不知道为什么我如此吝啬于与任何其他人分享那段极端邪恶的经历。

一上岸，我就看见一条刚刚被人踩出来的小路——穿过草丛，很宽。我记得自己高兴极了，对自己说：‘他走不了——他是用四肢在爬——他跑不掉的。’草叶湿湿的，沾满了露水。我握着拳头，大步流星地向前走。我一定是在模模糊糊地想，我要扑到他身上打他一顿。我记不清了。当时我的脑海里萌生出一些很蠢的念头。那个织毛线的老女人和那她膝上那只猫闯进了我的记忆，在这样一件壮举的另一端，竟然如此不合时宜地坐着那样一个人。我看见朝圣者们一字排开，把温彻斯特步枪抵在髋骨上，朝天开枪。我想，我永远也不要回到汽船上，我开始想象自己手无寸铁地孤身生活在森林中，直到白发苍苍，老态龙钟。就是诸如此类的蠢念头。我还记得自己把鼓声听成了心跳声，那平稳的节律让我心情愉悦。

尽管如此，我一直沿那条小路走着——不时停下脚步，凝神静听。夜色澄莹，四周一片玄青色，露珠和星星清辉点点，然而在这片夜色里，仿佛潜伏着许多黑影。我好像看到前头有什么东西在动。很奇怪地，那天晚上我在每一件事情上都毫无道理地充满了自信。我离开了那条小路，绕了一个大弯（我毫不怀疑，自己当时一定在暗暗发笑），以便绕到那些骚动不安的东西前头——如果我真的看见了什么东西的话。我要去截住库尔茨，好像正在玩小孩的追逐游戏一样。

我一头撞上了他。要不是他听到了我的脚步声，我肯定会摔到他身上去。他连忙颤颤巍巍地站了起来，细长，苍白，虚弱，好像从泥土里冒出来的一缕水蒸气，朦朦胧胧地在我面前袅袅升起，悄无声息。与此同时，在我身后，火光在树与树之间跳跃着，一片嗡嗡的低语声从森林里流淌而出。我敏捷地截住了他，而等我终于站在他的面前，我似乎猛然惊醒，一下子意识到情况的严峻。危机远未过去。他要喊起来怎么办？尽管他几乎连站都站不稳，他的声音依然浑厚有力。‘快走开——去躲起来。’他声音深沉地说，听得我毛骨悚然。我回头看了一眼。我们离最近的火堆还不到三十码。一个黑乎乎的人影站了起来，迈开又黑又长的双腿，摇摆着一双又黑又长的手臂，在火光中走来走去。这是个头上长着角的黑影——大概是羚羊角吧。他一定是个魔法师或巫师：简直像一个恶鬼。‘你知不知道自己在干什么？’我低声说。‘我很清楚。’他故意大声说出这几个字来，听起来是如此的遥远，却又如此响亮，好像是用扩音喇叭喊出来的。如果他嚷嚷起来，我们就遭殃了，我暗暗想道。此时此境并不适合动武，况且对这个幽灵——这个流离无依且饱受折磨的可怜虫，我也下不去手。‘你这是有去无回，’我说，‘你会彻底完蛋的。’人有时候就是会这样灵光一闪，是不是？我确实讲得没错，尽管实际上当时他已经一败涂地，不可能输得更惨。而也正是在那一刻，我们建立起了坚实的友谊，变得亲密无间——并将一直——一直亲密下去——直到世界末日——甚至更久。

‘我有许多宏伟的计划。’他吞吞吐吐地嘟囔道。‘我知道，’我说，‘但要是你敢喊出来，我就立马砸碎你的脑袋，用——’附近一根棍子、一块石头也看不见，‘我就立马掐死你，一了百了。’我改口说。‘我正准备干一番惊天动地的大事业，’他用充满热望的声音和满怀憧憬的语气哀求道，听得我心都凉了，‘现在却因为这个愚蠢的混账家伙——’‘你放心，回到欧洲，人们一定还会把你当成英雄。’我坚定地断言道。我不想掐死他——那样做没有半点实际的好处。我是想破除施在他身上的魔咒——荒野施在他身上的魔咒，无声无息，却犹如千钧重负，似乎是想通过唤醒遗失于记忆深处的兽性本能，唤醒扭曲的欲望和畸形的热情得到满足时的回忆，把他拉入自己那冷酷无情的怀抱。我相信，正是这个魔咒牵引着他，把他引到这片森林的边缘，引入丛林里，引他飞蛾扑火一般扑向那熊熊火光，那隆隆鼓声和那诵念诡异咒语的嗡嗡声。正是这个魔咒，蛊惑了他不安分的灵魂，使他犯下了人神共愤的罪行。而且，你们还不明白吗，那时的危险并不在于被人一棍打破脑袋——尽管我非常强烈地感到那随时可能发生——而在于我不得不与这个人周旋，不论我对他讲最崇高的话，或使用最下流的手段，他都无动于衷。我甚至不得不像那些黑人一样乞求他的庇佑——求助于他本人——求助于他引以为傲，却令人难以置信的堕落无耻。没有比他更崇高的事物，也没有比他更下流的事物，对此我心知肚明。他已经一脚把地球踢开了。这个魔鬼！他还把这个地球踢得支离破碎。他超然绝世，在他面前，我不知道自己是站在地上还是悬在空中。我一直在跟你们讲我们谈话的内容——重复一字一句——但那又有什么意义呢？它们只是再平常不过的日常用语——熟悉而模糊的声音，我们在生命中每一个清醒的日子里跟别人聊天时都会用到。尽管如此，我却觉得在这些字句背后，隐藏着梦里听到的话语，做噩梦时的梦呓，暗含骇人的启示。灵魂！如果曾经有人与一个灵魂苦苦缠斗过，这个人就是我。而且这个与我争论的人并不是一个疯子。你们相信也罢，不信也罢，他绝对神志清醒——他的确把全副精神只放在了自己身上，专注得可怖，但他的思维纹丝不乱。意识到这一点，我看到了一线生机——我当然不能在彼时彼地杀死他，因为他一定会大喊大叫，那我就完了。但他的灵魂已经疯掉了。在荒野中，它是如此孤独，它看透了自己，天啊！它怎么能不发疯。我也被迫——我想我也算是罪有应得——亲身经受把它看透的痛苦。他临终倾吐的由衷之言，令人对人类彻底寒心，与之相比，一切滔滔雄辩都显得苍白无力。他也在与自己苦苦搏斗，我看得出来——我听得出来。我看到了这个灵魂里难以想象的奥秘，它天不怕地不怕，不信神不信鬼，无畏无惧，只知道盲目地和自己过不去。我的头脑一直很清醒，但当我终于把他放进沙发，帮他平躺好，我已经满头大汗，两条腿直打战，好像我是背了半吨重的东西下山。可实际上我不过是搀着他走，他也只是把一条瘦骨嶙峋的手臂紧紧扣在我的脖子上——而且，他并不比一个孩子重多少。

第二天中午我们开船的时候，一直躲在树幕背后的那群人又从森林里汹涌而出，挤满了空地，占满了山坡，到处是青铜色的身体，裸露着，呼吸着，颤抖着。其实我早就敏锐地察觉到他们躲在那里了。我往上游驶了一段，然后掉头向下游开去。两千双眼睛盯着这个狂怒的河中巨魔，看着它嘭嘭咚咚地前进，溅起阵阵水花，一边用一条可怕的尾巴拍着水，向天空呼出滚滚黑烟。在沿河第一排土人的面前，有三个从头到脚涂满鲜红色泥土的人，焦急地来回踱着步。我们再次经过时，他们面朝河流不断跺脚，使劲儿点着戴着犄角装饰的头，猩红色的身体左摇右摆。他们冲狂怒的河魔晃动一捆黑色的羽毛，一张拖着尾巴的斑纹兽皮——那兽皮看起来像个干葫芦。他们隔一会儿就喊出一连串古怪的话，不像是人类的语言。而那片突然被打断的嗡嗡声，低沉深邃，仿佛是对某种邪恶祷文的回应。

我们把库尔茨抬进了驾驶室：那里空气更充足。他躺在沙发上，百叶窗没有放下来，他总是望出窗外。岸上人潮涌动。那个把头发盘成黑盔的黄褐色皮肤女人从人群中冲出来，跑到河边。她伸出双手喊了一句不知道什么话，那群狂暴的土人马上齐声怒号起来。那片怒号，清晰，急促，声嘶力竭。

‘您听得懂他们在喊什么吗？’我问。

他越过我看过去，怒火熊熊的目光里充满渴望，脸上交织着惆怅和憎恨的表情。他没有答话，但我看见，他那苍白的嘴唇露出一丝微笑，一丝耐人寻味的微笑。片刻之后，它抽搐了一下。‘我怎么会听不懂？’他缓缓地说，喘着气，好像这句话是一个超自然的力量从他身上撕下来的。

“我拉响了汽笛。我这么做是因为我看到甲板上的朝圣者们都兴冲冲地跑去拿来复枪，看他们的神情，好像对这个快乐的游戏期待万分。听到突如其来的汽笛尖叫声，一种无助的恐惧席卷了那个楔形的人群。”停手！别吓跑他们！甲板上有人恼火地喊道。我拉了一下又一下，土人们四散奔走，有的跳来跳去，有的蹲下身，有的团团打转，竭力想避开随着汽笛声飞过去的恐怖灾难。那三个猩红色的家伙吓得贴着地趴在河边，好像被射死了一样。唯独那个野蛮却艳丽的女人毫不畏缩，在我们后面，隔着那条波光粼粼却森冷阴郁的河流，哀伤地张开了裸露的双臂。

接着，下面甲板上那群蠢材开始玩他们的小游戏，一阵浓烟挡住了我的视线。

褐色的河水迅疾地从黑暗深处奔腾而下，把我们送往大海，速度是我们沿河上溯时的两倍。库尔茨的生命也在急促流逝，退潮一般，从他内心涌退，退入无情的时间之海里。经理一副安详的样子，现在他再不必为致命的危险担惊受怕了。他偷偷用深远而满足的眼神瞥了我们两人一眼：这个‘事件’的收场，不能再美满了。我看得出，很快我就会变成‘龌龊的手段’的唯一拥护者。朝圣者们都对我嗤之以鼻。这么说吧，我和这个濒死的人是一丘之貉。在那片横遭这帮刻薄贪婪的恶鬼入侵的神秘土地上，我竟然在毫无准备的情况下，心甘情愿地跟库尔茨站在了一边，并且义无反顾地接受了这个强加在我身上的噩梦，说起来也真是够奇怪的。

库尔茨又开腔了。一个声音！一个声音！直到最后一刻，它依然是如此的深沉浑厚。在生龙活虎的时候，库尔茨能用那些雄奇瑰丽的言辞掩盖住内心那片空虚的黑暗，直到现在，即使他已经油尽灯枯，那声音依然萦绕不散。啊，他也斗争过！他斗争过！现在，他的精神已经疲倦不堪，只剩一片废墟坏址，那些阴暗的鬼影却徘徊不去——名和利的鬼影，众星捧月一般，低眉顺眼地围着他卓绝高贵的不朽辩才团团转。我的未婚妻，我的象牙，我的贸易站，我的事业，我的思想——都是偶然会泄露出说话者高尚情怀的话题。从前那个库尔茨的幽灵常常在这个空洞的躯壳旁边出没，这个躯壳只是一个赝品，注定马上就要被埋进这片原始土地的一个土丘里。这个赝品曾彻悟到谜一样的人生里包含的残忍的爱和超脱的恨，而这爱和恨，你争我夺，都想把这个浸满原始感情的灵魂，这个汲汲于镜花水月般的功名利禄的灵魂据为己有。

他有时幼稚得令人生厌。他满心憧憬着，当有朝一日他从某个蛮荒之地成就了丰功伟业之后，衣锦还乡之时，会看到许多国王在火车站恭迎他。‘只要你能向他们展示出赚钱的本领，他们就会无限度地认可你的能力。’他会这么说，‘当然你不能为非作歹——动机一定要冠冕堂皇——谨记。’汽船在一成不变的漫长河道上前行着，驶过如出一辙的河湾，那些葱茏的原始大树，耐心地目送着它，这来自另一个世界的肮脏碎片，变革、征服、贸易、屠杀和幸福生活的先驱。我头也不回——我在驾船。‘关掉百叶窗，’一天库尔茨突然说，‘这景色令我发狂。’我照做了。驾驶室陷入一片寂静之中。‘啊！我还会回来把你折磨得肝肠寸断的！’他对着看不见的荒野大喊。

汽船坏掉了——不出我所料——我们只好在一个小岛的一角停船维修。这次耽搁破天荒地动摇了库尔茨的自信心。一天早晨他交给我一包文件和照片——用一根鞋带捆在一起的。‘请帮我保存好它。’他说，‘这个可恶的笨蛋（指经理）一趁我注意不到，就会把我的箱子翻个底朝天，他真做得出来。’下午我去看他时，他仰躺着，双目紧闭，我便安静地离开，但忽然听见他模糊不清地说：‘光明磊落地活着，死，死……’我侧耳倾听。他没有再说话。他是在梦中排练着某次演讲，还是在斟酌着某篇报文的字句？他一直有给报纸写文章，并打算继续写下去：‘为了传播我的思想。这是一个义务。’

他是一片密不透风的黑暗。我看着他，就好像在俯瞰一个躺在悬崖底的男人，阳光永远无法到达的悬崖底。但我能用来照顾他的时间并不多，因为我要帮轮机师拆开漏水的气缸，掰直弯掉的连杆，还有其他诸如此类的事情。我每天都生活在一大堆混乱的锈铁、锉刀、螺母、螺丝、扳手、锤子和曲柄钻之中，恍如置身地狱——我恨透了它们，因为它们非常不听使唤。我不得不频繁地跑到那个小小的打铁房里去，谢天谢地我们船上有一个打铁房。我在这堆废铜烂铁中没日没夜地拼命工作着——直到两条腿颤得站不住才去休息。

一天晚上，我点着一根蜡烛走进驾驶室，听见他在微微颤抖着说：‘我这是躺在黑暗中等死。’把我吓了一跳。我把蜡烛凑近他的脸，离他的眼睛不到一英尺，勉强低声说道：‘唉，别胡说！’我呆若木鸡地站在他身旁，低头看着他。

他的容貌扭曲了，我从没见过这种变化，哪怕是近似的变化也没有见过，也不想再见到。啊，我不是悲伤难抑，而是被迷住了。仿佛有人撕碎了他的面纱，那张象牙色的脸上，交织着阴森的骄傲、冷酷的威雄、懦弱的恐惧——一种激烈而彻底的绝望表情。在这个超凡的时刻，在他即将要大彻大悟之际，他是否在重温他的人生，抽丝剥茧地反思每一个欲望、每一种诱惑和每一次堕落？他轻轻地喊出声来，也许是对某个人影，也许是对某个场景——他喊了两声，轻得像是在喘气——

‘好可怕！好可怕！’

我吹熄蜡烛，离开了驾驶室。朝圣者们正在食堂吃饭，我在经理对面坐下，他抬起头，向我投来一瞥询问的眼光，我不露痕迹地假装没有看见。他向后靠到椅背上，一脸安宁，带着他特有的微笑，把他那深不见底的卑鄙轻轻藏起。无数小小的苍蝇不断地扑到油灯上，桌布上，我们的手上和脸上。经理的跟班突然从门外把那个傲慢无礼的黑脑袋伸进来，用尖厉的轻蔑口吻说——

‘库尔茨先生——死了。’

所有的朝圣者都冲出去看热闹。我一动不动，继续吃饭。他们肯定认为我铁石心肠。但我不太吃得下。食堂里有一盏油灯——有一点光——而食堂外面是如此的黑暗，黑暗得狰狞凶残。我再也没有回到那个卓越的男人身旁，他对于自己的灵魂在这个地球上的冒险之旅，已经宣布了最终定论。那个声音消逝了。那里可曾有过什么东西？可我当然知道，第二天朝圣者们把一个什么东西埋进了一个脏污的泥洞里。

而他们差点连我也埋掉了。

但是，你们也看见了，我没有当即随库尔茨而去。我没有。我要留下来把这个噩梦做完，并再次表达我对库尔茨的忠诚。命，这都是命！人生真令人哭笑不得——寡情少义的逻辑做出了种种神秘的安排，为的竟是让人白辛苦一场！它能给你的，至多也不过是你对自己的一点点认识——却又总是来得太迟——只是一腔令人死不瞑目的余恨。我曾不顾一切地与死神搏斗。你们想象不出那有多无聊。身处一片混沌的灰色之中，脚下空无一物，四周空无一物，没有观众，无人喝彩，毫不光荣，人既不无限渴望胜利，也不极度害怕失败，那种气氛温温吞吞、犹犹豫豫，令人作呕，使你怀疑自己的权利，更加怀疑对手的权利。如果最高的智慧表现出来就是这副模样，那人生必定是一个更大的谜，比某些人所想象的更为神秘。我当时差点就有机会说出我对人生的定论，但我很羞耻地发现，即使我真的要说，也一个字都说不出来。这就是我敢确定库尔茨很了不起的原因。他有话讲。他讲了出来。正因为我窥视到那条边界另一边的景象，我能更深刻地理解他的凝视，他看不到烛光，但那凝视是如此壮阔，足以容下整个宇宙，又是如此锐利，足以看透所有在黑暗中跳动着的心。他做出了总结——他下了定论。‘好可怕！’他是个了不起的人。毕竟，他表达了某种信念，内里有坦率，有坚定，他颤抖着轻声喊出了反抗的意念，让我瞥见了人生真相的狰狞画面——欲望和憎恨离奇地相互纠缠着。最令我刻骨铭心的，不是我当时面临的困境——而是一个无形的灰色场景，里面充满了肉身的痛苦，以及对一切事物的幻灭都漠不关心的轻蔑——甚至包括这些痛苦本身的幻灭。不！我经历的仿佛是他的困境。没错，在我获准撤回犹疑的脚步之时，他迈出了那最后的一步，越过了边界。也许正是这造成了天壤之别，也许所有的智慧，所有的真相，所有的诚意，全都压缩在了那个惊鸿一瞥的时刻之中，在我们迈过门槛，步入看不见的世界那一刻。也许是吧！我真希望自己对人生的总结不会是一句冷漠而轻蔑的话。他的喊声要好得多——好得多。那是一个断言，一个道德上的胜利，用无数的失败、可憎的恐惧和可憎的满足作为代价换来的。但它是一个胜利！正因为如此，我直到最终，甚至更长久地，都会对库尔茨忠心耿耿。直到很久之后，当我又一次听见，不是他本人的声音，而是他那滔滔雄辩的回响，仿佛从一个像水晶悬崖般透亮的灵魂向我发出来的，我对他的忠诚依然如故。

不，他们没有把我埋掉。尽管我模糊地记得，有一段时间，我好像走在一条通道里，那通道穿过某个不可思议的世界，那里既没有希望，也没有欲望。每次想起来都有点毛骨悚然。我发现自己又回到了那个阴森的城市，无比憎恶地看着人们匆匆忙忙地穿过街道，赶着去从彼此身上占点小便宜，去风卷残云般吃掉恶心的饭食，去开怀畅饮肮脏的啤酒，去做无聊又愚蠢的梦。他们践踏了我的思想。他们是入侵者，在我眼里，他们只不过是自欺欺人地装作很了解人生，简直令人生气，因为我能感觉到，他们绝对不可能知道我所知道的事情。他们的神态举止，纵使平凡得无可厚非，是平民百姓在高枕无忧、安居乐业时的平常表现，我却越看越恼火，仿佛看到的是一群蠢材，危险已逼近眼前，他们不仅无法理解，浑然不觉，还要在那里大肆炫耀自己的愚蠢。我们没有冲动要去唤醒他们，但我不太克制得住自己当面嘲笑他们有多么愚蠢，多么自以为是。我想我那时不太舒服。我在街上踉跄乱撞——有各种事要办——向可敬之极的人勉强挤出笑容。我承认我的所作所为简直荒谬，但在那段日子里，我的体温几乎没有正常过。我亲爱的姨妈绞尽脑汁地想帮我‘固本培元’，但那么做完全是南辕北辙。我不需要保养身体恢复元气，我是胡思乱想过甚，心灵需要抚慰。我留着库尔茨给我的那捆信，想不出到底应该怎么处理它。他母亲不久前过世了，听说逝前一直是他的未婚妻在侍汤奉药。一天有人来拜访我，他把胡子刮得干干净净，戴着金边眼镜，摆出一副公事公办的样子，提出许多问题，开始的时候还算委婉，后来就彬彬有礼地逼问我，要我说出那些他很乐意称之为‘文件’的东西到底在哪里。我并不惊讶，还没回来的时候，我就已经为此和经理吵过两架。我对经理说，我一张纸也不会给他，对这个戴眼镜的男人我也采取了相同的态度。最后他阴沉着脸，摆出一副威胁的样子，面红耳赤地争辩说公司有权利收回关于其‘领地’的一切信息。然后他说：‘鉴于库尔茨先生的伟大才能，以及他所处环境之恶劣，他对这片未开发地区的知识，肯定尤为全面独到，因此——’我向他申明，库尔茨的知识，不论多么全面，都与贸易或者公司行政方面的问题没有直接关系。接着他把科学搬了出来。‘如果……将会造成不可估量之损失’云云。我把那份‘破除野蛮传统’的报告交给他，不过注释已经被我事先撕掉了。他急不可耐地一把接了过去，看完后却轻蔑地对它嗤之以鼻。‘我们有权期望获得的并非这份文件。’他说。‘那就不要再白费心机了，’我说，‘剩下的全是私人信件。’他威胁要走法律途径，然后灰溜溜地走了，我再也没见过他。但两天后，另一个家伙来了，自称是库尔茨的表亲，急切地想知道他亲爱的亲戚临终时的全部细节。他不经意地向我透露，其实库尔茨本来是一个了不起的音乐家。‘差不多就要扬名四海了。’那人说，我相信他是一个风琴手，他灰白的长发瀑布般披在油汪汪的大衣衣领上。我没有理由怀疑他的话，但直到今天，我依然说不清楚库尔茨究竟所司何职，他又是否有过固定的职业——有什么职业能让他施展他最了不起的才华呢？我曾把他看成是会给报纸写文章的画家，或者是擅长绘画的记者——但就连这个表亲（在拜访期间一直吸鼻烟吸个不停）都说不上来他曾经是做什么职业的——准确地。他是个全面的天才——在这一点上，我同意这个老家伙的意见。他马上拿出一方巨大的棉布手帕，震耳欲聋地擤了擤鼻子，老气横秋、激动不已地与我告别，卷走了一些无关紧要的家庭信件和备忘录。最后拜访我的，是一个急于知道他‘亲爱的同事’命运如何的记者。这位来客告诉我，库尔茨的真正职业应该是‘站在大众的一边’的政客。他有一双毛茸茸的剑眉，一头硬挺挺的短发，眼镜上穿着黑色的粗带子。他突然说得兴起，承认他认为库尔茨根本不会写文章——‘但是，天啊！他太能说了！他能震慑住整个会场。他信念坚定——明白吗？——他有坚定的信念。他能让自己相信任何事情——任何事情。他要是参加极端的党派，一定能成为了不起的领袖。’‘什么党派？’我问。‘随便一个党派，’对方回答，‘他是个——一个——极端主义者。’我不也是这样想的吗？我表示赞成。他忽然好奇地问我知不知道‘到底是什么诱使他到那里去的？’‘我知道。’我说，立刻把那份著名的报告交给他，并请他出版，如果他认为合适的话。他草草扫了一眼，一边不停地喃喃自语，断言它‘会卖座的’，就把它顺走了。

就这样，我终于只剩下一小包信和那个姑娘的画像。我惊讶于她的美——我要说的是，她的表情很美。我知道阳光有时也会被迫撒谎，但我不禁感到，她脸上那种柔和而真挚的神情，不是靠操控光线和姿势能制造出来的。她看起来随时准备好在精神上毫无保留地倾听，不带丝毫的怀疑，完全把自身置之度外。我决定亲自去拜访她，把她的画像和那些信件还给她。出于好奇？没错，也许还出于其他心情。所有曾经属于库尔茨的一切，都从我的手上交了出去：他的灵魂，他的身体，他的贸易站，他的宏图大计，他的象牙，他的事业。只剩下他的回忆和他的未婚妻——我也想交出去了，从某种意义上讲，交给过去——我要亲手将他留给我的一切，全部交给那两个字：遗忘。所有人最终都免不了要遗忘。我没有在为自己辩护。我也不知道自己真正需要的到底是什么。也许那只是一时的心血来潮，由潜意识里的忠诚引起的，也许只是想要完成某个荒唐的任务，人生在世，不就是为了完成种种说不清道不明的任务么？我不知道。我无法分辨。但我去了。

我原本以为，对他的记忆与对其他死者的毫无二致，在每个人的一生中，这种记忆都会慢慢地越积越多——只是一个模糊的印象，影子一般掠过脑海，转瞬即逝。但当我来到那扇又高又沉的门前，站在街上高高的楼房中间，我却觉得那些楼房犹如一个精心维护的墓地里死寂却富丽的两排墓碑，我仿佛看到了他坐在担架上的幻象，贪婪地张大嘴巴，好像要吞掉整个地球和所有的人类。那一刻，他又在我面前活了过来，跟过去一样栩栩如生——一个影子，不知餍足地追求着外表的辉煌，追求着狰狞的现实，比黑夜的影子还要黑暗，披着卓绝辩才的高贵外衣。这个幻象似乎和我一起进入了房子——那个担架，抬担架的鬼影，他那群狂热却顺从的崇拜者，那群土人，森林的幽暗，烟水迷茫的河湾之间，河面的寒光，那鼓声，滞闷而规律的，宛如心跳声——那片被征服了的黑暗的心跳声。那是荒野的胜利时刻，一次狂暴的侵略和复仇，而我，要独自抵挡它，以拯救另一个灵魂。我又想起了他在那个远方说过的话，在我背后的火光中，在那片耐心的森林里，顶着羚羊角的人影在扭动着，我又听到了那些破碎的字句，简单得凶险，简单得令人惊颤。我记得他卑怯的央求，卑怯的威胁，卑怯而巨大的邪恶欲念，他灵魂里的卑鄙、苦恼，以及暴风雨般的痛苦。后来，我有一天去看他的时候，他似乎已经镇定下来，但样子十分憔悴。他说：‘此时此刻，这批象牙完全属于我所有，公司还没有为它们出过一分钱。是我自己一个人出生入死收集来的。但我担心他们将来一定会宣称那为公司所有。哼，真是棘手。你认为我应该怎么做呢——反抗？是吗？我只想他们还我一个公道。’……他想要的只是一个公道——只是公道。我上了二层，在一扇桃花心木门前按了按门铃。在我等候之时，他似乎躲在玻璃嵌板后面盯着我——用那个广阔无际的凝视，那个拥抱着、谴责着、憎恶着整个宇宙的凝视。我仿佛听到他在低声喊着：‘好可怕！好可怕！’

暮色渐浓。我必须在高高的客厅里等候。客厅里有三扇长长的落地窗，从天花板一直拖到地面，仿佛三根包裹着彩幔的大圆柱，隐隐生光。家具的弯腿和靠背镀了金，璀璨生辉，映照成模糊的曲线。高高的大理石壁炉是苍白色的，白得冰冷、哀伤。一个角落里摆着一架沉重的大钢琴，平滑的琴面泛着黑暗的光芒，整个地像一口暗淡而磨光的石棺。一扇高高的门开了——关了。我站起来。

她走上前来，一身黑衣，脸色苍白，在暮色中仿佛是在朝我飘来。她正在服丧。距离他去世之日已经有一年多了，距离死讯传来之日也已经有一年多了，可是，看她的样子，她永远会记得那一天，永远为他服丧。她握起我的双手，喃喃道：‘我早就听说您要来。’我注意到她并不是很年轻——我是说，她并不天真烂漫。她已经足够成熟，有能力驾驭忠诚、信仰与苦难。房间似乎越来越暗了，好像在那个浓云密布的黄昏，所有忧伤的光线都避祸一般聚集到她的额头上。那淡金的头发，苍白的面容，精致的蛾眉，似乎围绕在一个灰蒙蒙的光环里，那双黑色的眼睛，望穿了光环，定定地看着我。这目光诚实，深邃，自信，深信不疑。她高高地昂着悲伤的头，仿佛对这份悲伤倍感自豪，好像她要说：‘我——只有我懂得怎样得体地为他服丧。’但当我们还在握手的时候，她脸上浮现出一种凄荒得可怕的表情，我便察觉到，她属于绝不甘于沦为时间之神的玩物那类人。对她而言，库尔茨仿佛昨日才去世。而且，天啊！那个表情太动人心魄了，竟然使我也觉得，库尔茨是昨天刚去世的——不，库尔茨刚刚才去世。刹那间，我看见库尔茨和她同在——库尔茨的死和她的悲伤——我看见在库尔茨死去那一刻，她眼里的悲伤。你们能理解吗？我看见他们同在——我听见他们同在。她深深叹了一口气，哽咽着说：‘我活了下来。’然而我那紧绷的耳朵似乎无限清晰地听到，与她那绝望悔恨的声调交融在一起的，是库尔茨那个低喊，库尔茨下的那个定论，那个永恒的谴责。我问自己，我在那里做什么，心中万分惊恐，仿佛我不慎闯进了一个人类看不得的地方，里面满是残忍而怪诞的谜。她示意我坐到一张椅子上，我们坐下来。我把那个小小的包裹轻轻地放到一张小桌子上，她把手放在上面……‘您一定非常了解他。’悲痛地沉默了片刻之后，她喃喃说道。

‘在那种地方，人和人很容易变得亲密起来。’我说，‘我对他的了解，深入得可谓无以复加。’

‘而且您也很欣赏他吧，’她说，‘了解他的人不可能不欣赏他，是吗？’

‘他是个非凡卓绝的人。’我迟疑地说。她若有所求地定定看着我，似乎满心期待我说下去。我又说：‘了解他的人，不可能不——’

‘爱他。’她迫不及待地替我把话说完，把我吓得哑口无言，‘说得真对！说得真对！但请您知道，没人比我更了解他！他把自己所有高贵的信赖，都毫无保留地交给了我。我最懂他。’

‘您最懂他。’我重复道。而也许她确实最懂他。但我们每说一句话，房间似乎就变得更暗一些，只有她细滑而白皙的额头，仍然被信仰和爱的永恒光芒映照得光亮如雪。

‘您是他的朋友，’她继续说，‘他的朋友。’她重复道，稍微提高了一点声音，‘您当然是他的朋友，因为他把这个包裹交了给您，并请您来见我。我感觉我可以和您推心置腹地谈一谈——啊！我一定要说出来。我希望您能——您这个听到了他临终遗言的人——您能明白我对他是多么重要……我并不是要以此为豪……没错，我确实很自豪地认为，我比地球上任何人都更加了解他——他也曾亲口对我这么说过。但自从他母亲过世之后，我就找不到人——没有人——来——来——’

我静静听着。暮色越来越浓了。我甚至不确定库尔茨是不是把对的那个包裹交给了我。我相当地怀疑，他想交给我保管的，是另一包信件，他死后经理在灯下细细检查的那包。这位姑娘不停地说着话，她深信我在同情她，希望能从我身上得到安慰。她如饥似渴地倾诉着。她说她的家人十分反对这桩婚事，仿佛是因为库尔茨不够富有。实际上，我也不知道库尔茨是否自始至终都是一个穷小子。通过与他的接触，我绝对有理由推断，正是由于厌倦了自己不够富有，他才义无反顾地跑到了那个地方去。

‘……只要有幸一闻其声，有谁能不为他倾倒呢？’她在说着，‘他能唤起人们内心最美好的情感，使人们归心于他。’她神色庄重地看着我，‘这是伟人的天赋。’她继续说道，她的声音，似乎淹没在缭乱的伴奏声中，那伴奏里，满是谜样的神秘、孤寂的凄凉和愁肠百结的悲伤，我曾在哪里听到过的——河水潺潺，风中的绿树飒飒，野人群的怪语嗡嗡，从远处传来的回响细细，如此的深邃难解，还有一个微弱的低语声，越过那个永恒的黑暗世界的门槛，幽幽传来。‘但您听见他说的话了！您听见了！’她叫了起来。

‘是的，没错，我听见了。’我怀着某种近似绝望的情绪说，在她心中坚定的信仰面前，在那伟大得足以救赎一切罪孽的幻象面前，我看见那幻象在黑暗中闪耀着天堂的光彩，我屈服了。在那片不可一世的黑暗中，我没有能力保护她——我甚至没有办法保护我自己。

‘对我而言，这是一个多么大的损失——不，应该是对我们而言！’她非常有风度地改口道，真是慷慨。然后又低声补充道：‘对于整个世界而言。’在黄昏最后一丝光线里，我看得见她闪着光的眼里饱含泪水——她一直强忍着的泪水。

‘我曾经是多么高兴——多么幸运——多么自豪，’她继续说道，‘太幸运了。有那么一阵子，我实在是太快乐了。而现在，我是如此不幸——抱恨终身。’

她站起来，淡金色的头发仿佛聚拢了所有黄昏的余光，熠熠生辉。我也站起身来。

‘而所有的这一切，’她继续摧心剖肝地说道，‘他所有的承诺，所有的伟大，所有的宏伟思想，他高贵的心灵，都荡然无存了——逝去了，只剩下回忆。您和我——’

‘我们会永远缅怀他。’我连忙说。

‘不！’她叫道，‘这一切不可能就这样灰飞烟灭——这样一个人牺牲之后，怎么可能不留下只鳞片羽——除去不尽的悲伤之外？您知道他胸中的宏图伟业，我也知道——也许我无能力去理解——但有其他人听闻过。一定有什么东西留存了下来。至少，他的高谈阔论仍然充满了生命力。’

‘他的高谈阔论是不朽的。’我说。

‘而且他也树立起了一个榜样，’她轻声自语道，‘人们会景仰他——他的一言一行，都闪耀着美德的光辉。他是一个绝佳的榜样——’

‘是的，’我说，‘他还树立起了一个榜样。是的，榜样。我给忘了。’

‘但我没有。我不能——我不能够相信——还是不能。我不能相信永远都见不到他了，没有任何人会再见到他了，永远，永远，永远！’

她伸开双臂，仿佛在目送一个面朝着她渐行渐远的人，她把手深入黑暗之中，在窗户逐渐暗淡下去的狭窄光亮之中，轻轻扣住一双苍白的手。再也看不见他！我那个时候已经清清楚楚地看见了他。终我一生，我将一直看得见这个雄辩滔滔的幽灵，而我也会看见她，一个哀伤而熟悉的阴影。她现在的姿势，跟另一个人如出一辙，那个同样哀伤的阴影，浑身挂满了无能为力的符咒，在那条黑暗之河上，张开了裸露的棕色手臂。她突然非常低沉地说：‘他虽死犹生。’

‘这个结局，’我说，闷在心中的愤怒翻江倒海，‘完全对得起他的人生。’

‘但我没能陪伴他到最后。’她低声道。我突然对她生出无限的怜悯，不生气了。

‘我们尽力了——’我嘟囔道。

‘啊，但我对他的信仰之深，超过了地球上任何一个人——比他自己的母亲还要多，比——他自己还要多。他离不开我！我！他的每声叹息，每句话，每个手势，每个眼神，我都将无比珍重爱惜。’

我感到一阵寒气冰住了我的心。‘别这样。’我强压着声音说。

‘对不起。我——我——服丧了这么久，如此孤寂——如此孤寂……您和他在一起——您在他临终时陪伴在旁？我常常想，他是多么孤独啊！身边没有如我一般了解他的人，也许连听他说话的人都没有……’

‘我一直陪伴在他身旁，’我颤抖着说，‘我听见了他的临终遗言……’我害怕得不敢往下说。

‘请您重复一次好吗，’她肝肠寸断地低声说，‘我想要——想要——某些东西——某些东西——来——来支撑我活下去。’

我简直马上就要向她咆哮道：‘您不是听见了吗？’那句话在暮色中低声回荡着，一声紧似一声，仿佛风刚起时的轻响，咄咄逼人地越刮越烈。‘好可怕！好可怕！’

‘他的临终遗言——支撑我活下去，’她低声道，‘难道您不明白我爱他——我爱他——我爱他！’

我用尽浑身气力，缓缓地说了一句话。

‘他最后说的是——您的名字。’

“我听见一声轻微的叹息，我的心脏仿佛被冻住了。一声狂喜却凄厉的尖叫，充满胜利的神秘喜悦，无可言说的痛苦，把我的心完全石化了。‘我就知道——我从未怀疑过！’……她知道，她从未怀疑过。我听见她哭得梨花带雨，她把脸深深地埋在手里。我似乎感到，我还来不及逃走，这座房子就会塌掉，天也会塌下来砸死我。但一切如故。天才不会为了这样一件小事就塌掉。我真想知道，如果我能替库尔茨争取到他想要的公道，天会塌下来吗？他不是说了，他想要的只是公道吗？但我帮不了他。我不能告诉这个姑娘。那实在是太黑暗了——黑暗得太凶残了……”

马洛讲完了。他坐在一边，朦胧，寂静，那姿势仿佛一座正在修行悟道的佛像。有那么一阵子，众人一动不动。“我们错过了第一次退潮。”主任突然说。我把头抬起来。海面上横遮着一堆乌云，那条通向天涯海角的河道，在阴沉的天空下，忧伤地流淌着——仿佛头也不回地，要流入一片庞大的黑暗的心中。





Chapter One


The Nellie, a cruising yawl, swung to her anchor without a futter of the sails, and was at rest. The food had made, the wind was nearly calm, and being bound down the river, the only thing for it was to come to and wait for the turn of the tide.

The sea-reach of the Thames stretched before us like the beginning of an interminable waterway. In the offing the sea and the sky were welded together without a joint, and in the luminous space the tanned sails of the barges drifting up with the tide seemed to stand still in red clusters of canvas sharply peaked, with gleams of varnished sprits.A haze rested on the low shores that ran out to sea in vanishing flatness.The air was dark above Gravesend, and further back still seemed condensed into a mournful gloom, brooding motionless over the biggest, and the greatest, town on earth.

The Director of Companies was our captain and our host. We four affectionately watched his back as he stood in the bows looking to seaward.On the whole river there was nothing that looked half so nautical.He resembled a pilot, which to a seaman is trustworthiness personified.It was difficult to realise his work was not out there in the luminous estuary, but behind him, within the brooding gloom.

Between us there was, as I have already said somewhere, the bond of the sea. Besides holding our hearts together through long periods of separation, it had the effect of making us tolerant of each others yarns-and even convictions.The Lawyer-the best of old fellows-had, because of his many years and many virtues, the only cushion on deck, and was lying on the only rug.The Accountant had brought out already a box of dominoes, and was toying architecturally with the bones.Marlow sat cross-legged right aft, leaning against the mizzen-mast.He had sunken cheeks, a yellow complexion, a straight back, an ascetic aspect, and, with his arms dropped, the palms of hands outwards, resembled an idol.The Director, satisfied the anchor had good hold, made his way aft and sat down amongst us.We exchanged a few words lazily.Afterwards there was silence on board the yacht.For some reason or other we did not begin that game of dominoes.We felt meditative, and ft for nothing but placid staring.The day was ending in a serenity of still and exquisite brilliance.The water shone pacifically；the sky, without a speck, was a benign immensity of unstained light；the very mist on the Essex marshes was like a gauzy and radiant fabric, hung from the wooded rises inland, and draping the low shores in diaphanous folds.Only the gloom to the west, brooding over the upper reaches, became more sombre every minute, as if angered by the approach of the sun.

And at last, in its curved and imperceptible fall, the sun sank low, and from glowing white changed to a dull red without rays and without heat, as if about to go out suddenly, stricken to death by the touch of that gloom brooding over a crowd of men.

Forthwith a change came over the waters, and the serenity became less brilliant but more profound. The old river in its broad reach rested unruffed at the decline of day, after ages of good service done to the race that peopled its banks, spread out in the tranquil dignity of a waterway leading to the uttermost ends of the earth.We looked at the venerable stream not in the vivid flush of a short day that comes and departs for ever, but in the august light of abiding memories.And indeed nothing is easier for a man who has, as the phrase goes，“followed the sea”with reverence and affection, than to evoke the great spirit of the past upon the lower reaches of the Thames.The tidal current runs to and fro in its unceasing service, crowded with memories of men and ships it had borne to the rest of home or to the battles of the sea.It had known and served all the men of whom the nation is proud, from Sir Francis Drake to Sir John Franklin, knights all, titled and untitled-the great knights-errant of the sea.It had borne all the ships whose names are like jewels fashing in the night of time, from the Golden Hind returning with her round fanks full of treasure, to be visited by the Queen‘s Highness and thus pass out of the gigantic tale, to the Erebus and Terror, bound on other conquests-and that never returned.It had known the ships and the men.They sailed from Deptford, from Greenwich, from Erith-the adventurers and the settlers；kings’ships and the ships of men onChange；captains, admirals, the dark“interlopers”of the Eastern trade, and the commissioned“generals”of East India feets.Hunters for gold or pursuers of fame, they all had gone out on that stream, bearing the sword, and often the torch, messengers of the might within the land, bearers of a spark from the sacred fre.What greatness had not foated on the ebb of that river into the mystery of an unknown earth！……The dreams of men, the seed of commonwealths, the germs of empires.

The sun set；the dusk fell on the stream, and lights began to appear along the shore. The Chapman lighthouse, a three-legged thing erect on a mudfat, shone strongly.Lights of ships moved in the fairway-a great stir of lights going up and going down.And further west on the upper reaches the place of the monstrous town was still marked ominously on the sky, a brooding gloom in sunshine, a lurid glare under the stars.

“And this also，”said Marlow suddenly，“has been one of the dark places of the earth.”

He was the only man of us who still“followed the sea.”The worst that could be said of him was that he did not represent his class. He was a seaman, but he was a wanderer too, while most seamen lead, if one may so express it, a sedentary life.Their minds are of the stay-at-home order, and their home is always with them-the ship；and so is their country-the sea.One ship is very much like another, and the sea is always the same.In the immutability of their surroundings the foreign shores, the foreign faces, the changing immensity of life, glide past, veiled not by a sense of mystery but by a slightly disdainful ignorance；for there is nothing mysterious to a seaman unless it be the sea itself, which is the mistress of his existence and as inscrutable as Destiny.For the rest, after his hours of work, a casual stroll or a casual spree on shore suffces to unfold for him the secret of a whole continent, and generally he fnds the secret not worth knowing.The yarns of seamen have an effective simplicity, the whole meaning of which lies within the shell of a cracked nut.But, as has been said, Marlow was not typical（if his propensity to spin yarns be excepted），and to him the meaning of an episode was not inside like a kernel but outside, enveloping the tale which brought it out only as a glow brings out a haze, in the likeness of one of these misty halos that, sometimes, are made visible by the spectral illumination of moonshine.

His remark did not seem at all surprising. It was just like Marlow.It was accepted in silence.No one took the trouble to grunt even；and presently he said, very slow—

“I was thinking of very old times, when the Romans frst came here, nineteen hundred years ago-the other day……Light came out of this river since-you say Knights?Yes；but it is like a running blaze on a plain, like a fash of lightning in the clouds. We live in the ficker-may it last as long as the old earth keeps rolling！But darkness was here yesterday.Imagine the feelings of say a commander of a fine-what d‘ye call’em?—trireme in the Mediterranean, ordered suddenly to the north；run overland across the Gauls in a hurry；put in charge of one of these craft the legionaries-a wonderful lot of handy men they must have been too-used to build, apparently by the hundred, in a month or two, if we may believe what we read.Imagine him here-the very end of the world, a sea the colour of lead, a sky the colour of smoke, a kind of ship about as rigid as a concertina-and going up this river with stores, or orders, or what you like.Sandbanks, marshes, forests, savages-precious little to eat ft for a civilised man, nothing but Thames water to drink.No Falernian wine here, no going ashore.Here and there a military camp lost in a wilderness like a needle in a bundle of hay-cold, fog, tempests, disease, exile, and death-death skulking in the air, in the water, in the bush.They must have been dying like fies here.Oh yes-he did it.Did it very well, too, no doubt, and without thinking much about it either, except afterwards to brag of what he had gone through in his time, perhaps.They were men enough to face the darkness.And perhaps he was cheered by keeping his eye on a chance of promotion to the feet at Ravenna, by and bye, if he had good friends in Rome and survived the awful climate.Or think of a decent young citizen in a toga-perhaps too much dice, you know-coming out here in the train of some prefect, or tax-gatherer, or trader even, to mend his fortunes.Land in a swamp, march through the woods, and in some inland post feel the savagery, the utter savagery, had closed round him-all that mysterious life of the wilderness that stirs in the forests, in the jungles, in the hearts of wild men.Theres no initiation either into such mysteries.He has to live in the midst of the incomprehensible, which is also detestable.And it has a fascination, too, that goes to work upon him.The fascination of the abomination-you know.Imagine the growing regrets, the longing to escape, the powerless disgust, the surrender, the hate.”

He paused.

“Mind，”he began again, lifting one arm from the elbow, the palm of the hand outwards, so that, with his legs folded before him, he had the pose of a Buddha preaching in European clothes and without a lotus-flower—“Mind, none of us would feel exactly like this. What saves us is effciency-the devotion to effciency.But these chaps were not much account, really.They were no colonists；their administration was merely a squeeze, and nothing more, I suspect.They were conquerors, and for that you want only brute force-nothing to boast of, when you have it, since your strength is just an accident arising from the weakness of others.They grabbed what they could get and for the sake of what was to be got.It was just robbery with violence, aggravated murder on a great scale, and men going at it blind-as is very proper for those who tackle a darkness.The conquest of the earth, which mostly means the taking it away from those who have a different complexion or slightly fatter noses than ourselves, is not a pretty thing when you look into it too much.What redeems it is the idea only.An idea at the back of it；not a sentimental pretence but an idea；and an unselfsh belief in the idea-something you can set up, and bow down before, and offer a sacrifce to……”

He broke off. Flames glided in on the river, small green flames, red flames, white flames, pursuing, overtaking, joining, crossing each other-then separating slowly or hastily.The traffc of the great city went on in the deepening night upon the sleepless river.We looked on, waiting patiently-there was nothing else to do till the end of the food；but it was only after a long silence, when he said, in a hesitating voice，“I suppose you fellows remember I did once turn fresh-water sailor for a bit，”that we knew we were fated, before the ebb began to run, to hear about one of Marlows inconclusive experiences.

“I dont want to bother you much with what happened to mepersonally，”he began, showing in this remark the weakness of many tellers of tales who seem so often unaware of what their audience would best like to hear；yet to understand the effect of it on me you ought to know how I got out there, what I saw, how I went up that river to the place where I first met the poor chap. It was the furthest point of navigation and the culminating point of my experience.It seemed somehow to throw a kind of light on everything about me-and into my thoughts.It was sombre enough too-and pitiful-not extraordinary in any way-not very clear either.No, not very clear.And yet it seemed to throw a kind of light.

I had then, as you remember, just returned to London after a lot of Indian Ocean, Pacific, China Seas-a regular dose of the East-six years or so, and I was loafng about, hindering you fellows in your work and invading your homes, just as though I had got a heavenly mission to civilise you. It was very fne for a time, but after a bit I did get tired of resting.Then I began to look for a ship-I should think the hardest work on earth.But the ships wouldnt even look at me.And I got tired of that game too.

Now when I was a little chap I had a passion for maps. I would look for hours at South America, or Africa, or Australia and lose myself in all the glories of exploration.At that time there were many blank spaces on the earth, and when I saw one that looked particularly inviting on a map（but they all look that）I would put my fnger on it and say, When I grow up I will go there.The North Pole was one of these places, I remember.Well, I haven‘t been there yet, and shall not try now.The glamour’s off.Other places were scattered about the Equator, and in every sort of latitude all over the two hemispheres.I have been in some of them, and……well, we wont talk about that.But there was one yet-the biggest, the most blank, so to speak-that I had a hankering after.

True, by this time it was not a blank space any more. It had gotflled since my boyhood with rivers and lakes and names.It had ceased to be a blank space of delightful mystery-a white patch for a boy to dream gloriously over.It had become a place of darkness.But there was in it one river especially, a mighty big river, that you could see on the map, resembling an immense snake uncoiled, with its head in the sea, its body at rest curving afar over a vast country, and its tail lost in the depths of the land.And as I looked at the map of it in a shop-window, it fascinated me like a snake would a bird-a silly little bird.Then I remembered there was a big concern, a Company for trade on that river.Dash it all！I thought to myself, they can‘t trade without using some kind of craft on that lot of fresh water-steamboats！Why shouldn’t I try to get charge of one.I went on along Fleet Street, but could not shake off the idea.The snake had charmed me.

You understand it was a Continental concern, that Trading society；but I have a lot of relations living on the Continent, because its cheap and not so nasty as it looks, they say.

I am sorry to own I began to worry them. This was already a fresh departure for me.I was not used to get things that way, you know.I always went my own road and on my own legs where I had a mind to go.I wouldn‘t have believed it of myself；but, then-you see-I felt somehow I must get there by hook or by crook.So I worried them.The men said’My dear fellow，‘and did nothing.Then-would you believe it?—I tried the women.I, Charlie Marlow, set the women to work-to get a job.Heavens！Well, you see, the notion drove me.I had an aunt, a dear enthusiastic soul.She wrote：’It will be delightful.I am ready to do anything, anything for you.It is a glorious idea.I know the wife of a very high personage in the Administration, and also a man who has lots of infuence with，etc.，etc.She was determined to make no end of fuss to get me appointed skipper of a river steamboat, if such was my fancy.

I got my appointment-of course；and I got it very quick. It appears the Company had received news that one of their captains had been killed in a scuffle with the natives.This was my chance, and it made me the more anxious to go.It was only months and months afterwards, when I made the attempt to recover what was left of the body, that I heard the original quarrel arose from a misunderstanding about some hens.Yes, two black hens.Fresleven-that was the fellow‘s name, a Dane-thought himself wronged somehow in the bargain, so he went ashore and started to hammer the chief of the village with a stick.Oh, it didn’t surprise me in the least to hear this, and at the same time to be told that Fresleven was the gentlest, quietest creature that ever walked on two legs.No doubt he was；but he had been a couple of years already out there engaged in the noble cause, you know, and he probably felt the need at last of asserting his self-respect in some way.Therefore he whacked the old nigger mercilessly, while a big crowd of his people watched him, thunderstruck, till some man-I was told the chief‘s son-in desperation at hearing the old chap yell, made a tentative jab with a spear at the white man-and of course it went quite easy between the shoulder-blades.Then the whole population cleared into the forest, expecting all kinds of calamities to happen, while, on the other hand, the steamer Fresleven commanded left also in a bad panic, in charge of the engineer, I believe.Afterwards nobody seemed to trouble much about Fresleven’s remains, till I got out and stepped into his shoes.I couldn‘t let it rest though；but when an opportunity offered at last to meet my predecessor, the grass growing through his ribs was tall enough to hide his bones.They were all there.The supernatural being had not been touched after he fell.And the village was deserted, the huts gaped black, rotting, all askew within the fallen enclosures.A calamity had come to it, sure enough.The people had vanished.Mad terror had scattered them, men, women, and children, through the bush, and theyhad never returned.What became of the hens I don’t know either.I should think the cause of progress got them, anyhow.However, through this glorious affair I got my appointment, before I had fairly begun to hope for it.

I flew around like mad to get ready, and before forty-eight hours I was crossing the Channel to show myself to my employers, and sign the contract. In a very few hours I arrived in a city that always makes me think of a whited sepulchre.Prejudice no doubt.I had no diffculty in fnding the Companys offces.It was the biggest thing in the town, and everybody I met was full of it.They were going to run an over-sea empire, and make no end of coin by trade.

A narrow and deserted street in deep shadow, high houses, innumerable windows with venetian blinds, a dead silence, grass sprouting between the stones, imposing carriage archways right and left, immense double doors standing ponderously ajar. I slipped through one of these cracks, went up a swept and ungarnished staircase, as arid as a desert, and opened the first door I came to.Two women, one fat and the other slim, sat on straw-bottomed chairs, knitting black wool.The slim one got up and walked straight at me-still knitting with downcast eyes-and only just as I began to think of getting out of her way, as you would for a somnambulist, stood still, and looked up.Her dress was as plain as an umbrella-cover, and she turned round without a word and preceded me into a waiting-room.I gave my name, and looked about.Deal table in the middle, plain chairs all round the walls, on one end a large shining map, marked with all the colours of a rainbow.There was a vast amount of red-good to see at any time, because one knows that some real work is done in there, a deuce of a lot of blue, a little green, smears of orange, and, on the East Coast, a purple patch, to show where the jolly pioneers of progress drink the jolly lager-beer.However, I wasnt going into anyof these.I was going into the yellow.Dead in the centre.And the river was there-fascinating-deadly-like a snake.Ough！A door opened, a white-haired secretarial head, but wearing a compassionate expression, appeared, and a skinny forefnger beckoned me into the sanctuary.Its light was dim, and a heavy writing-desk squatted in the middle.From behind that structure came out an impression of pale plumpness in a frock-coat.The great man himself.He was fve feet six, I should judge, and had his grip on the handle-end of ever so many millions.He shook hands, I fancy, murmured vaguely, was satisfed with my French.Bon voyage.

In about forty-fve seconds I found myself again in the waiting-room with the compassionate secretary, who, full of desolation and sympathy, made me sign some document. I believe I undertook amongst other things not to disclose any trade secrets.Well, I am not going to.

I began to feel slightly uneasy. You know I am not used to such ceremonies, and there was something ominous in the atmosphere.It was just as though I had been let into some conspiracy-I dont know-something not quite right；and I was glad to get out.In the outer room the two women knitted black wool feverishly.People were arriving, and the younger one was walking back and forth introducing them.The old one sat on her chair.Her fat cloth slippers were propped up on a foot-warmer, and a cat reposed on her lap.She wore a starched white affair on her head, had a wart on one cheek, and silver-rimmed spectacles hung on the tip of her nose.She glanced at me above the glasses.The swift and indifferent placidity of that look troubled me.Two youths with foolish and cheery countenances were being piloted over, and she threw at them the same quick glance of unconcerned wisdom.She seemed to know all about them and about me too.An eerie feeling came over me.She seemed uncanny and fateful.Often far away there I thought of these two, guarding the door of Darkness, knitting black wool as for a warm pall, one introducing, introducing continuously to the unknown, the other scrutinising the cheery and foolish faces with unconcerned old eyes.Ave！Old knitter of black wool.Morituri te salutant.Not many of these she looked at ever saw her again-not half, by a long way.

There was yet a visit to the doctor.‘A simple formality，’assured me the secretary, with an air of taking an immense part in all my sorrows. Accordingly a young chap wearing his hat over the left eyebrow, some clerk I suppose-there must have been clerks in the business, though the house was as still as a house in a city of the dead-came from somewhere up-stairs and led me forth.He was shabby and careless, with ink-stains on the sleeves of his jacket, and his cravat was large and billowy, under a chin shaped like the toe of an old boot.It was a little too early for the doctor, so I proposed a drink, and thereupon he developed a vein of joviality.As we sat over our vermouths he glorified the Company‘s business and by and bye I expressed casually my surprise at him not going out there.He became very cool and collected all at once.’I am not such a fool as I look, quoth Plato to his disciples，he said sententiously, emptied his glass with great resolution, and we rose.

The old doctor felt my pulse, evidently thinking of something else the while.‘Good, good for there，’he mumbled, and then with a certain eagerness asked me whether I would let him measure my head. Rather surprised, I said Yes, when he produced a thing like callipers and got the dimensions back and front and every way, taking notes carefully.He was an unshaven little man in a threadbare coat like a gaberdine, with his feet in slippers, and I thought him a harmless fool.‘I always ask leave, in the interests of science, to measure the crania of those going out there，’he said.‘And when they come back too?’I asked.‘Oh, I never see them，’he remarked；‘and, moreover, the changes take place inside, you know.’He smiled, as if at some quiet joke.‘So you are going out there.Famous.Interesting too.’He gave me a searching glance, and made another note.‘Ever any madness in your family?’he asked, in a matter-of-fact tone.I felt very annoyed.‘Is that question in the interests of science too?’‘It would be，’he said, without taking notice of my irritation，‘interesting for science to watch the mental changes of individuals, on the spot, but……’‘Are you an alienist?’I interrupted.‘Every doctor should be-a little，’answered that original, imperturbably.‘I have a little theory which you Messieurs who go out there must help me to prove.This is my share in the advantages my country shall reap from the possession of such a magnifcent dependency.The mere wealth I leave to others.Pardon my questions, but you are the frst Englishman coming under my observation……’I hastened to assure him I was not in the least typical.‘If I were，’said I，‘I wouldn’t be talking like this with you.‘’What you say is rather profound, and probably erroneous，‘he said, with a laugh.’Avoid irritation more than exposure to the sun.Adieu.How do you English say, eh?Goodbye.Ah！Goodbye.Adieu.In the tropics one must before everything keep calm.‘……He lifted a warning forefnger……’Du calme, du calme.Adieu.

One thing more remained to do-say goodbye to my excellent aunt. I found her triumphant.I had a cup of tea-the last decent cup of tea for many, many days-and in a room that most soothingly looked just as you would expect a lady‘s drawing-room to look, we had a long quiet chat by the fireside.In the course of these confidences it became quite plain to me I had been represented to the wife of the high dignitary, and goodness knows to how many more people besides, as an exceptional and gifted creature-a piece of good fortune for the Company-a man you don’t get hold of every day.Good heavens！and I was going to take charge of a two pence-halfpenny river-steamboat with a penny whistle attached！It appeared, however, I was also one of the Workers, with a capital-you know.Something like an emissary of light, something like a lower sortof apostle.There had been a lot of such rot let loose in print and talk just about that time, and the excellent woman, living right in the rush of all that humbug, got carried off her feet.She talked about‘weaning those ignorant millions from their horrid ways，’till, upon my word, she made me quite uncomfortable.I ventured to hint that the Company was run for proft.

‘You forget, dear Charles, that the labourer is worthy of his hire，’she said, brightly. Its queer how out of touch with truth women are！They live in a world of their own, and there had never been anything like it, and never can be.It is too beautiful altogether, and if they were to set it up it would go to pieces before the frst sunset.Some confounded fact we men have been living contentedly with ever since the day of creation would start up and knock the whole thing over.

After this I got embraced, told to wear flannel, be sure to write often, and so on-and I left. In the street-I don‘t know why-a queer feeling came to me that I was an impostor.Odd thing that I, who used to clear out for any part of the world at twenty-four hours’notice, with less thought than most men give to the crossing of a street, had a moment-I wont say of hesitation, but of startled pause, before this commonplace affair.The best way I can explain it to you is by saying that, for a second or two, I felt as though, instead of going to the centre of a continent, I were about to set off for the centre of the earth.

I left in a French steamer, and she called in every blamed port they have out there, for, as far as I could see, the sole purpose of landing soldiers and custom-house officers. I watched the coast.Watching a coast as it slips by the ship is like thinking about an enigma.There it is before you-smiling, frowning, inviting, grand, mean, insipid, or savage, and always mute with an air of whispering, Come and find out.This one was almost featureless, as if still in the making, with an aspect ofmonotonous grimness.The edge of a colossal jungle, so dark-green as to be almost black, fringed with white surf, ran straight, like a ruled line, far, far along a blue sea whose glitter was blurred by a creeping mist.The sun was ferce, the land seemed to glisten and drip with steam.Here and there greyish-whitish specks showed up, clustered inside the white surf, with a flag flying above them perhaps.Settlements-settlements, some centuries old, and still no bigger than pin-heads on the untouched expanse of their background.We pounded along, stopped, landed soldiers；went on, landed custom-house clerks to levy toll in what looked like a God-forsaken wilderness, with a tin shed and a fag-pole lost in it；landed more soldiers-to take care of the custom-house clerks, presumably.Some, I heard, got drowned in the surf；but whether they did or not, nobody seemed particularly to care.They were just flung out there, and on we went.Every day the coast looked the same, as though we had not moved；but we passed various places-trading places-with names like Gran‘Bassam, Little Popo, names that seemed to belong to some sordid farce acted in front of a sinister backcloth.The idleness of a passenger, my isolation amongst all these men with whom I had no point of contact, the oily and languid sea, the uniform sombreness of the coast, seemed to keep me away from the truth of things, within the toils of a mournful and senseless delusion.The voice of the surf heard now and then was a positive pleasure, like the speech of a brother.It was something natural, that had its reason, that had a meaning.Now and then a boat from the shore gave one a momentary contact with reality.It was paddled by black fellows.You could see from afar the white of their eyeballs glistening.They shouted, sang；their bodies streamed with perspiration；they had faces like grotesque masks-these chaps；but they had bone, muscle, a wild vitality, an intense energy of movement, that was as natural and true as the surf along their coast.They wanted no excuse for being there.They were a great comfort to look at.For a time I would feel I belonged still to a world of straightforward facts；but the feeling would not last long.Something would turn up to scare it away.Once, I remember, we came upon a man-of-war anchored off the coast.There wasn’t even a shed there, and she was shelling the bush.It appears the French had one of their wars going on thereabouts.Her ensign drooped limp like a rag；the muzzles of the long eight-inch guns stuck out all over the low hull；the greasy, shiny swell swung her up lazily and let her down, swaying her thin masts.In the empty immensity of earth, sky, and water, there she was, incomprehensible, fring into a continent.Pop, would go one of the eight-inch guns；a small fame would dart and vanish, a little white smoke would disappear, a tiny projectile would give a feeble screech-and nothing happened.Nothing could happen.There was a touch of insanity in the proceeding, a sense of lugubrious drollery in the sight；and it was not dissipated by somebody on board assuring me earnestly there was a camp of natives-he called them enemies！—hidden out of sight somewhere.

We gave her her letters（I heard the men in that lonely ship were dying of fever at the rate of three a day）and went on. We called at some more places with farcical names, where the merry dance of death and trade goes on in a still and earthy atmosphere as of an overheated catacomb；all along the formless coast bordered by dangerous surf, as if Nature herself had tried to ward off intruders；in and out of rivers, streams of death in life, whose banks were rotting into mud, whose waters, thickening into slime, invaded the contorted mangroves, that seemed to writhe at us in the extremity of an impotent despair.Nowhere did we stop long enough to get a particularised impression, but the general sense of vague and oppressive wonder grew upon me.It was like a weary pilgrimage amongst hints for nightmares.

It was upwards of thirty days before I saw the mouth of the bigriver. We anchored off the seat of the government.But my work would not begin till some two hundred miles further on.So as soon as I could I made a start for a place thirty miles higher up.

I had my passage on a little sea-going steamer. Her captain was a Swede, and knowing me for a seaman, invited me on the bridge.He was a young man, lean, fair, and morose, with lanky hair and a shuffing gait.As we left the miserable little wharf, he tossed his head contemptuously at the shore.‘Been living there?’he asked.I said，‘Yes.’‘Fine lot these government chaps-are they not?’he went on, speaking English with great precision and considerable bitterness.‘It is funny what some people will do for a few francs a month.I wonder what becomes of that kind when it goes up country?’I told him I expected to see that soon.‘So-o-o！’he exclaimed.He shuffed athwart, keeping one eye ahead vigilantly.‘Don’t be too sure，‘he continued.’The other day I took up a man who hanged himself on the road.He was a Swede, too.‘’Hanged himself！Why, in God‘s name?’I cried.He kept on looking out watchfully.‘Who knows?The sun too much for him, or the country perhaps.’

At last we opened a reach. A rocky cliff appeared, mounds of turned-up earth by the shore, houses on a hill, others, with iron roofs, amongst a waste of excavations, or hanging to the declivity.A continuous noise of rapids above hovered over this scene of inhabited devastation.A lot of people, mostly black and naked, moved about like ants.A jetty projected into the river.A blinding sunlight drowned all this at times in a sudden recrudescence of glare.‘There’s your Company‘s station，’said the Swede, pointing to three wooden barrack-like structures hanging on the rocky slope.‘I will send your things up.Four boxes did you say?So.Farewell.’

I came upon a boiler wallowing in the grass, then found a path leading up the hill. It turned aside for the boulders, and also for anundersized railway-truck lying there on its back with its wheels in the air.One was off.The thing looked as dead as the carcass of some animal.I came upon more pieces of decaying machinery, a stack of rusty rails.To the left a clump of trees made a thick shade, where dark things seemed to stir feebly.I blinked, the path was steep.A horn tooted to the right, and I saw the black people run.A heavy and dull detonation shook the ground, a puff of smoke came out of the cliff, and that was all.No change appeared on the face of the rock.They were building a railway.The cliff was not in the way or anything；but this objectless blasting was all the work going on.

A slight clinking behind me made me turn my head. Six black men advanced in a fle, toiling up the path.They walked erect and slow, balancing small baskets full of earth on their heads, and the clink kept time with their footsteps.Black rags were wound round their loins, and the short ends behind wagged to and fro like tails.I could see every rib, the joints of their limbs were like knots in a rope；each had an iron collar on his neck, and all were connected together with a chain whose bights swung between them, rhythmically clinking.Another report from the cliff made me think suddenly of that ship of war I had seen firing into a continent.It was the same kind of ominous voice；but these men could by no stretch of imagination be called enemies.They were called criminals, and the outraged law, like the bursting shells, had come to them, an insoluble mystery from over the sea.All the meagre breasts panted together, the violently dilated nostrils quivered, the eyes stared stonily up-hill.They passed me within six inches, without a glance, with that complete, deathlike indifference of unhappy savages.Behind this raw matter one of the reclaimed, the product of the new forces at work, strolled despondently, carrying a rifle by its middle.He had a uniform jacket with one button off, and seeing a white man on the path, hoisted hisweapon on to his shoulder with alacrity.This was simple prudence, white men being so much alike at a distance that he could not tell who I might be.He was speedily reassured, and with a large, white, rascally grin, and a glance at his charge, seemed to take me into partnership in his exalted trust.After all, I also was a part of the great cause of these high and just proceedings.

Instead of going up, I turned and descended to the left. My idea was to let that chain-gang get out of sight before I climbed the hill.You know I am not particularly tender；I‘ve had to strike and to fend off.I’ve had to resist and to attack sometimes-that‘s only one way of resisting-without counting the exact cost, according to the demands of such sort of life as I had blundered into.I’ve seen the devil of violence, and the devil of greed, and the devil of hot desire；but, by all the stars！these were strong, lusty, red-eyed devils, that swayed and drove men-men, I tell you.But as I stood on this hillside, I foresaw that in the blinding sunshine of that land I would become acquainted with a fabby, pretending, weak-eyed devil of a rapacious and pitiless folly.How insidious he could be, too, I was only to fnd out several months later and a thousand miles further.For a moment I stood appalled, as though by a warning.Finally I descended the hill, obliquely, towards the trees I had seen.

I avoided a vast, artifcial hole somebody had been digging on the slope, the purpose of which I found it impossible to divine. It wasn‘t a quarry or a sandpit, anyhow.It was just a hole.It might have been connected with the philanthropic desire of giving the criminals something to do.I don’t know.Then I nearly fell into a very narrow ravine, almost no more than a scar in the hillside.I discovered that a lot of imported drainage-pipes for the settlement had been tumbled in there.There wasnt one that was not broken.It was a wanton smash-up.At last I got under the trees.My purpose was to stroll into the shade for a moment；but no soonerwithin than it seemed to me I had stepped into the gloomy circle of some Inferno.The rapids were near, and an uninterrupted, uniform, headlong, rushing noise flled the mournful stillness of the grove, where not a breath stirred, not a leaf moved, with a mysterious sound-as though the tearing pace of the launched earth had suddenly become audible.

Black shapes crouched, lay, sat between the trees, leaning against the trunks, clinging to the earth, half coming out, half effaced within the dim light, in all the attitudes of pain, abandonment, and despair. Another mine on the cliff went off, followed by a slight shudder of the soil under my feet.The work was going on.The work！And this was the place where some of the helpers had withdrawn to die.

They were dying slowly-it was very clear. They were not enemies, they were not criminals, they were nothing earthly now-nothing but black shadows of disease and starvation, lying confusedly in the greenish gloom.Brought from all the recesses of the coast in all the legality of time contracts, lost in uncongenial surroundings, fed on unfamiliar food, they sickened, became ineffcient, and were then allowed to crawl away and rest.These moribund shapes were free as air-and nearly as thin.I began to distinguish the gleam of eyes under the trees.Then, glancing down, I saw a face near my hand.The black bones reclined at full length with one shoulder against the tree, and slowly the eyelids rose and the sunken eyes looked up at me, enormous and vacant, a kind of blind, white ficker in the depths of the orbs, which died out slowly.The man seemed young-almost a boy-but you know with them it‘s hard to tell.I found nothing else to do but to offer him one of my good Swede’s ships biscuits I had in my pocket.The fngers closed slowly on it and held-there was no other movement and no other glance.He had tied a bit of white worsted round his neck-Why?Where did he get it?Was it a badge-an ornament-a charm-a propitiatory act?Was there any idea at all connected with it?Itlooked startling round his black neck, this bit of white thread from beyond the seas.

Near the same tree two more, bundles of acute angles, sat with their legs drawn up. One, with his chin propped on his knees, stared at nothing, in an intolerable and appalling manner：his brother phantom rested its forehead, as if overcome with a great weariness；and all about others were scattered in every pose of contorted collapse, as in some picture of a massacre or a pestilence.While I stood horror-struck, one of these creatures rose to his hands and knees, and went off on all-fours towards the river to drink.He lapped out of his hand, then sat up in the sunlight, crossing his shins in front of him, and after a time let his woolly head fall on his breastbone.

I didnt want any more loitering in the shade, and I made haste towards the station. When near the buildings I met a white man, in such an unexpected elegance of get-up that in the frst moment I took him for a sort of vision.I saw a high starched collar, white cuffs, a light alpaca jacket, snowy trousers, a clear silk necktie, and varnished boots.No hat.Hair parted, brushed, oiled, under a green-lined parasol held in a big white hand.He was amazing, and had a penholder behind his ear.

I shook hands with this miracle, and I learned he was the Company‘s chief accountant, and that all the book-keeping was done at this station. He had come out for a moment, he said，’to get a breath of fresh air.‘The expression sounded wonderfully odd, with its suggestion of sedentary desk-life.I wouldn’t have mentioned the fellow to you at all, only it was from his lips that I frst heard the name of the man who is so indissolubly connected with the memories of that time.Moreover, I respected the fellow.Yes；I respected his collars, his vast cuffs, his brushed hair.His appearance was certainly that of a hairdresser‘s dummy；but in the great demoralisation of the land he kept up his appearance.That’s backbone！His starched collars and got-up shirt-fronts were achievements of character.He had been out nearly three years；and, later on, I could not help asking him how he managed to sport such linen.He had just the faintest blush, and said modestly，‘I’ve been teaching one of the native women about the station.It was diffcult.She had a distaste for the work.Thus this man had, verily, accomplished something.And he was devoted to his books, which were in apple-pie order.

Everything else in the station was in a muddle-heads, things, buildings. Caravans, strings of dusty niggers with splay feet arrived and departed；a stream of manufactured goods, rubbishy cottons, beads, and brass wire set off into the depths of darkness, and in return came a precious trickle of ivory.

I had to wait in the station for ten days-an eternity. I lived in a tent in the yard, but to be out of the chaos I would sometimes get into the accountant‘s office.It was built of horizontal planks, and so badly put together that, as he bent over his high desk, he was barred from neck to heels with narrow strips of sunlight.There was no need to open the big shutter to see.It was hot there too；big flies buzzed fiendishly, and did not sting, but stabbed.I sat generally on the foor, while, of faultless appearance（and even slightly scented），perching on a high stool, he wrote, he wrote.Sometimes he stood up for exercise.When a truckle-bed with a sick man（some invalided’agent‘from up country）was hurriedly put in there, he exhibited a gentle annoyance.’The groans of this sick person，‘he said，’distract my attention.And without that it is extremely diffcult to guard against clerical errors in this climate.

One day he remarked, without lifting his head，‘In the interior you will no doubt meet Mr. Kurtz.’On my asking who Mr.Kurtz was, he said he was a first-class agent；and seeing my disappointment at this information, he added slowly, laying down his pen，‘He is a veryremarkable person.’Further questions elicited from him that Mr.Kurtz was at present in charge of a trading-post, a very important one, in the true ivory-country, at‘the very bottom of there.Sends in as much ivory as all the others put together……’He began to write again.The sick man was too ill to groan.The fies buzzed in a great peace.

Suddenly there was a growing murmur of voices and a great tramping of feet. A caravan had come in.A violent babble of uncouth sounds burst out on the other side of the planks.All the carriers were speaking together, and in the midst of the uproar the lamentable voice of the chief agent was heard‘giving it up’tearfully for the twentieth time that day……He rose slowly.‘What a frightful row，’he said.He crossed the room gently to look at the sick man, and returning, said to me，‘He does not hear.’‘What！Dead?’I asked, startled.‘No, not yet，’he answered, with great composure.Then, alluding with a toss of the head to the tumult in the station-yard，‘When one has got to make correct entries, one comes to hate these savages-hate them to the death！’He remained thoughtful for a moment.‘When you see Mr.Kurtz，’he went on，‘tell him from me that everything here’—he glanced at the desk—‘is very satisfactory.I don’t like to write to him-with those messengers of ours you never know who may get hold of your letter-at that Central Station.‘He stared at me for a moment with his mild, bulging eyes.’Oh, he will go far, very far，‘he began again.’He will be a somebody in the Administration before long.They, above-the Council in Europe, you know-mean him to be.

He turned to his work. The noise outside had ceased, and presently in going out I stopped at the door.In the steady buzz of flies the homeward-bound agent was lying flushed and insensible；the other, bent over his books, was making correct entries of perfectly correct transactions；and ffty feet below the doorstep I could see the still tree-tops of the grove of death.

Next day I left that station at last, with a caravan of sixty men, for a two-hundred-mile tramp.

No use telling you much about that. Paths, paths, everywhere；a stamped-in network of paths spreading over an empty land, through long grass, through burnt grass, through thickets, down and up chilly ravines, up and down stony hills ablaze with heat；and a solitude, a solitude, nobody, not a hut.The population had cleared out a long time ago.Well, if a lot of mysterious niggers armed with all kinds of fearful weapons suddenly took to traveling on the road between Deal and Gravesend, catching the yokels right and left to carry heavy loads for them, I fancy every farm and cottage thereabouts would get empty very soon.Only here the dwellings were gone too.Still I passed through several abandoned villages.There‘s something pathetically childish in the ruins of grass walls.Day after day, with the stamp and shuffe of sixty pair of bare feet behind me, each pair under a sixty-pound.load.Camp, cook, sleep, strike camp, march.Now and then a carrier dead in harness, at rest in the long grass near the path, with an empty water-gourd and his long staff lying by his side.A great silence around and above.Perhaps on some quiet night the tremor of far-off drums, sinking, swelling, a tremor vast, faint；a sound weird, appealing, suggestive, and wild-and perhaps with as profound a meaning as the sound of bells in a Christian country.Once a white man in an unbuttoned uniform, camping on the path with an armed escort of lank Zanzibaris, very hospitable and festive-not to say drunk.Was looking after the upkeep of the road, he declared.Can’t say I saw any road or any upkeep, unless the body of a middle-aged negro, with a bullet-hole in the forehead, upon which I absolutely stumbled three miles further on, may be considered as a permanent improvement.I had a white companion too, not a bad chap, but rather too feshy and with the exasperating habit of fainting on the hot hillsides, miles away from the least bit of shade andwater.Annoying, you know, to hold your own coat like a parasol over a man‘s head while he is coming-to.I couldn’t help asking him once what he meant by coming there at all.‘To make money, of course.What do you think?’he said, scornfully.Then he got fever, and had to be carried in a hammock slung under a pole.As he weighed sixteen stone I had no end of rows with the carriers.They jibbed, ran away, sneaked off with their loads in the night-quite a mutiny.So, one evening, I made a speech in English with gestures, not one of which was lost to the sixty pairs of eyes before me, and the next morning I started the hammock off in front all right.An hour afterwards I came upon the whole concern wrecked in a bush-man, hammock, groans, blankets, horrors.The heavy pole had skinned his poor nose.He was very anxious for me to kill somebody, but there wasn‘t the shadow of a carrier near.I remembered the old doctor，—’It would be interesting for science to watch the mental changes of individuals, on the spot.‘I felt I was becoming scientifcally interesting.However, all that is to no purpose.On the ffteenth day I came in sight of the big river again, and hobbled into the Central Station.It was on a back water surrounded by scrub and forest, with a pretty border of smelly mud on one side, and on the three others enclosed by a crazy fence of rushes.A neglected gap was all the gate it had, and the frst glance at the place was enough to let you see the flabby devil was running that show.White men with long staves in their hands appeared languidly from amongst the buildings, strolling up to take a look at me, and then retired out of sight somewhere.One of them, a stout, excitable chap with black mustaches, informed me with great volubility and many digressions, as soon as I told him who I was, that my steamer was at the bottom of the river.I was thunderstruck.What, how, why?Oh, it was’all right.‘The’manager himself‘was there.All quite correct.’Everybody had behaved splendidly！splendidly！‘—’you must，‘he said in agitation，’go and see the general manager at once.He iswaiting！

I did not see the real signifcance of that wreck at once. I fancy I see it now, but I am not sure-not at all.Certainly the affair was too stupid-when I think of it-to be altogether natural.Still……But at the moment it presented itself simply as a confounded nuisance.The steamer was sunk.They had started two days before in a sudden hurry up the river with the manager on board, in charge of some volunteer skippe, and before they had been out three hours they tore the bottom out of her on stones, and she sank near the south bank.I asked myself what I was to do there, now my boat was lost.As a matter of fact, I had plenty to do in fishing my command out of the river.I had to set about it the very next day.That, and the repairs when I brought the pieces to the station, took some months.

My first interview with the manager was curious. He did not ask me to sit down after my twenty-mile walk that morning.He was commonplace in complexion, in features, in manners, and in voice.He was of middle size and of ordinary build.His eyes, of the usual blue, were perhaps remarkably cold, and he certainly could make his glance fall on one as trenchant and heavy as an axe.But even at these times the rest of his person seemed to disclaim the intention.Otherwise there was only an indefnable, faint expression of his lips, something stealthy-a smile-not a smile-I remember it, but I can‘t explain.It was unconscious, this smile was, though just after he had said something it got intensifed for an instant.It came at the end of his speeches like a seal applied on the words to make the meaning of the commonest phrase appear absolutely inscrutable.He was a common trader, from his youth up employed in these parts-nothing more.He was obeyed, yet he inspired neither love nor fear, nor even respect.He inspired uneasiness.That was it！Uneasiness.Not a defnite mistrust-just uneasiness-nothing more.You have no idea how effective such a……a……faculty can be.He had no geniusfor organising, for initiative, or for order even.That was evident in such things as the deplorable state of the station.He had no learning, and no intelligence.His position had come to him-why?Perhaps because he was never ill……He had served three terms of three years out there……Because triumphant health in the general rout of constitutions is a kind of power in itself.When he went home on leave he rioted on a large scale-pompously.Jack ashore-with a difference-in externals only.This one could gather from his casual talk.He originated nothing, he could keep the routine going-that’s all.But he was great.He was great by this little thing that it was impossible to tell what could control such a man.He never gave that secret away.Perhaps there was nothing within him.Such a suspicion made one pause-for out there there were no external checks.Once when various tropical diseases had laid low almost every‘agent’in the station, he was heard to say，‘Men who come out here should have no entrails.’He sealed the utterance with that smile of his, as though it had been a door opening into a darkness he had in his keeping.You fancied you had seen things-but the seal was on.When annoyed at meal-times by the constant quarrels of the white men about precedence, he ordered an immense round table to be made, for which a special house had to be built.This was the station‘s mess-room.Where he sat was the frst place-the rest were nowhere.One felt this to be his unalterable conviction.He was neither civil nor uncivil.He was quiet.He allowed his’boy-an overfed young negro from the coast-to treat the white men, under his very eyes, with provoking insolence.

He began to speak as soon as he saw me. I had been very long on the road.He could not wait.Had to start without me.The up-river stations had to be relieved.There had been so many delays already that he did not know who was dead and who was alive, and how they got on-and so on, and so on.He paid no attention to my explanations, and, playing with astick of sealing-wax, repeated several times that the situation was‘very grave, very grave.’There were rumours that a very important station was in jeopardy, and its chief, Mr.Kurtz, was ill.Hoped it was not true.Mr.Kurtz was……I felt weary and irritable.Hang Kurtz, I thought.I interrupted him by saying I had heard of Mr.Kurtz on the coast.‘Ah！So they talk of him down there，’he murmured to himself.Then he began again, assuring me Mr.Kurtz was the best agent he had, an exceptional man, of the greatest importance to the Company；therefore I could understand his anxiety.He was, he said，‘very, very uneasy.’Certainly he fdgeted on his chair a good deal, exclaimed，‘Ah, Mr.Kurtz！’broke the stick of sealing-wax and seemed dumbfounded by the accident.Next thing he wanted to know‘how long it would take to—’I interrupted him again.Being hungry, you know, and kept on my feet too, I was getting savage.‘How could I tell?’I said.‘I hadn’t even seen the wreck yet-some months, no doubt.‘All this talk seemed to me so futile.’Some months，‘he said.’Well, let us say three months before we can make a start.Yes.That ought to do the affair.‘I fung out of his hut（he lived all alone in a clay hut with a sort of verandah）muttering to myself my opinion of him.He was a chattering idiot.Afterwards I took it back when it was borne upon me startlingly with what extreme nicety he had estimated the time requisite for the’affair.

I went to work the next day, turning, so to speak, my back on that station. In that way only it seemed to me I could keep my hold on the redeeming facts of life.Still, one must look about sometimes；and then I saw this station, these men strolling aimlessly about in the sunshine of the yard.I asked myself sometimes what it all meant.They wandered here and there with their absurd long staves in their hands, like a lot of faithless pilgrims bewitched inside a rotten fence.The word‘ivory’rang in the air, was whispered, was sighed.You would think they were praying to it.A taint of imbecile rapacity blew through it all, like a whiff fromsome corpse.By Jove！Ive never seen anything so unreal in my life.And outside, the silent wilderness surrounding this cleared speck on the earth struck me as something great and invincible, like evil or truth, waiting patiently for the passing away of this fantastic invasion.

Oh, these months！Well, never mind. Various things happened.One evening a grass shed full of calico, cotton prints, beads, and I don‘t know what else, burst into a blaze so suddenly that you would have thought the earth had opened to let an avenging fre consume all that trash.I was smoking my pipe quietly by my dismantled steamer, and saw them all cutting capers in the light, with their arms lifted high, when the stout man with moustaches came tearing down to the river, a tin pail in his hand, assured me that everybody was’behaving splendidly, splendidly，dipped about a quart of water and tore back again.I noticed there was a hole in the bottom of his pail.

I strolled up. There was no hurry.You see the thing had gone off like a box of matches.It had been hopeless from the very frst.The fame had leaped high, driven everybody back, lighted up everything-and collapsed.The shed was already a heap of embers glowing fiercely.A nigger was being beaten near by.They said he had caused the fre in some way；be that as it may, he was screeching most horribly.I saw him, later on, for several days, sitting in a bit of shade looking very sick and trying to recover himself：afterwards he arose and went out-and the wilderness without a sound took him into its bosom again.As I approached the glow from the dark I found myself at the back of two men, talking.I heard the name of Kurtz pronounced, then the words，‘take advantage of this unfortunate accident.’One of the men was the manager.I wished him a good evening.‘Did you ever see anything like it-eh?it is incredible，’he said, and walked off.The other man remained.He was a first-class agent, young, gentlemanly, a bit reserved, with a forked little beard and ahooked nose.He was stand-offsh with the other agents, and they on their side said he was the manager‘s spy upon them.As to me, I had hardly ever spoken to him before.We got into talk, and by and bye we strolled away from the hissing ruins.Then he asked me to his room, which was in the main building of the station.He struck a match, and I perceived that this young aristocrat had not only a silver-mounted dressing-case but also a whole candle all to himself.Just at that time the manager was the only man supposed to have any right to candles.Native mats covered the clay walls；a collection of spears, assegais, shields, knives was hung up in trophies.The business entrusted to this fellow was the making of bricks-so I had been informed；but there wasn’t a fragment of a brick anywhere in the station, and he had been there more than a year-waiting.It seems he could not make bricks without something, I dont know what-straw maybe.Anyways, it could not be found there, and as it was not likely to be sent from Europe, it did not appear clear to me what he was waiting for.An act of special creation perhaps.However, they were all waiting-all the sixteen or twenty pilgrims of them-for something；and upon my word it did not seem an uncongenial occupation, from the way they took it, though the only thing that ever came to them was disease-as far as I could see.They beguiled the time by backbiting and intriguing against each other in a foolish kind of way.There was an air of plotting about that station, but nothing came of it, of course.It was as unreal as everything else-as the philanthropic pretence of the whole concern, as their talk, as their government, as their show of work.The only real feeling was a desire to get appointed to a trading-post where ivory was to be had, so that they could earn percentages.They intrigued and slandered and hated each other only on that account-but as to effectually lifting a little fnger-oh, no.By heavens！there is something after all in the world allowing one man to steal a horse while another must not look at a halter.Steal a horsestraight out.Very well.He has done it.Perhaps he can ride.But there is a way of looking at a halter that would provoke the most charitable of saints into a kick.

I had no idea why he wanted to be so sociable, but as we chatted in there it suddenly occurred to me the fellow was trying to get at something-in fact, pumping me. He alluded constantly to Europe, to the people I was supposed to know there-putting leading questions as to my acquaintances in the sepulchral city, and so on.His little eyes glittered like mica discs-with curiosity-though he tried to keep up a bit of superciliousness.At frst I was astonished, but very soon I became also awfully curious to see what he would fnd out from me.I couldnt possibly imagine what I had in me to make it worth his while.It was very pretty to see how he baffed himself, for in truth my body was full of chills, and my head had nothing in it but that wretched steamboat business.It was evident he took me for a perfectly shameless prevaricator.At last he got angry, and, to conceal a movement of furious annoyance, he yawned.I rose.Then I noticed a small sketch in oils, on a panel, representing a woman, draped and blindfolded, carrying a lighted torch.The background was sombre-almost black.The movement of the woman was stately, and the effect of the torchlight on the face was sinister.

It arrested me, and he stood by, civilly holding an empty half-pint champagne bottle（medical comforts）with the candle stuck in it. To my question he said Mr.Kurtz had painted this-in this very station more than a year ago-while waiting for means to go to his trading-post.‘Tell me, pray，’said I，‘who is this Mr.Kurtz?’

‘The chief of the Inner Station，’he answered in a short tone, looking away.‘Much obliged，’I said, laughing.‘And you are the brickmaker of the Central Station. Every one knows that.’He was silent for a while.‘He is a prodigy，’he said at last.‘He is an emissary of pity, and science, and progress, and devil knows what else.We want，’he began to declaim suddenly，‘for the guidance of the cause entrusted to us by Europe, so to speak, higher intelligence, wide sympathies, a singleness of purpose.’‘Who says that?’I asked.‘Lots of them，’he replied.‘Some even write that；and so he comes here, a special being, as you ought to know.’‘Why ought I to know?’I interrupted, really surprised.He paid no attention.‘Yes.To-day he is chief of the best station, next year he will be assistant-manager, two years more and……but I dare say you know what he will be in two years’time.You are of the new gang-the gang of virtue.The same people who sent him specially also recommended you.Oh, don‘t say no.I’ve my own eyes to trust.‘Light dawned upon me.My dear aunt’s infuential acquaintances were producing an unexpected effect upon that young man.I nearly burst into a laugh.‘Do you read the Company’s confidential correspondence?‘I asked.He hadn’t a word to say.It was great fun.‘When Mr.Kurtz，’I continued severely，‘is General Manager, you won’t have the opportunity.

He blew the candle out suddenly, and we went outside. The moon had risen.Black figures strolled about listlessly, pouring water on the glow, whence proceeded a sound of hissing；steam ascended in the moonlight, the beaten nigger groaned somewhere.‘What a row the brute makes！’said the indefatigable man with the moustaches, appearing near us.‘Serve him right.Transgression-punishment-bang！Pitiless, pitiless.That’s the only way.This will prevent all confagrations for the future.I was just telling the manager……‘He noticed my companion, and became crestfallen all at once.’Not in bed yet，‘he said, with a kind of servile heartiness；’it‘s so natural.Ha！Danger-agitation.’He vanished.I went on to the river-side, and the other followed me.I heard a scathing murmur at my ear，‘Heap of muffs-go to.’The pilgrims could be seen in knots gesticulating, discussing.Several had still their staves in theirhands.I verily believe they took these sticks to bed with them.Beyond the fence the forest stood up spectrally in the moonlight, and through the dim stir, through the faint sounds of that lamentable courtyard, the silence of the land went home to one‘s very heart-its mystery, its greatness, the amazing reality of its concealed life.The hurt nigger moaned feebly somewhere near by, and then fetched a deep sigh that made me mend my pace away from there.I felt a hand introducing itself under my arm.’My dear sir，‘said the fellow，’I don‘t want to be misunderstood, and especially by you, who will see Mr.Kurtz long before I can have that pleasure.I wouldn’t like him to get a false idea of my disposition……

“I let him run on, this papier-mâché Mephistopheles, and it seemed to me that if I tried I could poke my forefinger through him, and find nothing inside but a little loose dirt, maybe.He, don‘t you see, had been planning to be assistant-manager by and bye under the present man, and I could see that the coming of that Kurtz had upset them both not a little.He talked precipitately, and I did not try to stop him.I had my shoulders against the wreck of my steamer, hauled up on the slope like a carcass of some big river animal.The smell of mud, of primeval mud, by Jove！was in my nostrils, the high stillness of primeval forests was before my eyes；there were shiny patches on the black creek.The moon had spread over everything a thin layer of silver-over the rank grass, over the mud, upon the wall of matted vegetation standing higher than the wall of a temple, over the great river I could see through a sombre gap glittering, glittering, as it fowed broadly by without a murmur.All this was great, expectant, mute, while the man jabbered about himself.I wondered whether the stillness on the face of the immensity looking at us two were meant as an appeal or as a menace.What were we who had strayed in here?Could we handle that dumb thing, or would it handle us?I felt how big, how confoundedly big, was that thing that couldn’ttalk, and perhaps was deaf as well.What was in there?I could see a little ivory coming out from there, and I had heard Mr.Kurtz was in there.I had heard enough about it too-God knows！Yet somehow it didn‘t bring any image with it-no more than if I had been told an angel or a fiend was in there.I believed it in the same way one of you might believe there are inhabitants in the planet Mars.I knew once a Scotch sailmaker who was certain, dead sure, there were people in Mars.If you asked him for some idea how they looked and behaved, he would get shy and mutter something about’walking on all-fours.‘If you as much as smiled, he would-though a man of sixty-offer to fght you.I would not have gone so far as to fght for Kurtz, but I went for him near enough to a lie.You know I hate, detest, and can’t bear a lie, not because I am straighter than the rest of us, but simply because it appals me.There is a taint of death, a flavour of mortality in lies-which is exactly what I hate and detest in the world-what I want to forget.It makes me miserable and sick, like biting something rotten would do.Temperament, I suppose.Well, I went near enough to it by letting the young fool there believe anything he liked to imagine as to my infuence in Europe.I became in an instant as much of a pretence as the rest of the bewitched pilgrims.This simply because I had a notion it somehow would be of help to that Kurtz whom at the time I did not see-you understand.He was just a word for me.I did not see the man in the name any more than you do.Do you see him?Do you see the story?Do you see anything?It seems to me I am trying to tell you a dream-making a vain attempt, because no relation of a dream can convey the dream-sensation, that commingling of absurdity, surprise, and bewilderment in a tremor of struggling revolt, that notion of being captured by the incredible which is of the very essence of dreams……”

He was silent for a while.

“……No, it is impossible；it is impossible to convey the life-sensationof any given epoch of ones existence-that which makes its truth, its meaning-its subtle and penetrating essence. It is impossible.We live, as we dream-alone……”

He paused again as if refecting, then added—

“Of course in this you fellows see more than I could then. You see me, whom you know……”

It had become so pitch dark that we listeners could hardly see one another. For a long time already he, sitting apart, had been no more to us than a voice.There was not a word from anybody.The others might have been asleep, but I was awake.I listened, I listened on the watch for the sentence, for the word, that would give me the clue to the faint uneasiness inspired by this narrative that seemed to shape itself without human lips in the heavy night-air of the river.

“……Yes-I let him run on，”Marlow began again，and think what he pleased about the powers that were behind me. I did！And there was nothing behind me！There was nothing but that wretched, old, mangled steamboat I was leaning against, while he talked fluently about‘the necessity for every man to get on.’‘And when one comes out here, you conceive, it is not to gaze at the moon.’Mr.Kurtz was a‘universal genius，’but even a genius would find it easier to work with‘adequate tools-intelligent men.’He did not make bricks-why, there was a physical impossibility in the way-as I was well aware；and if he did secretarial work for the manager, it was because‘no sensible man rejects wantonly the confidence of his superiors.’Did I see it?I saw it.What more did I want?What I really wanted was rivets, by heaven！Rivets.To get on with the work-to stop the hole.Rivets I wanted.There were cases of them down at the coast-cases-piled up-burst-split！You kicked a loose rivet at every second step in that station yard on the hillside.Rivets had rolled into the grove of death.You could fll your pockets with rivetsfor the trouble of stooping down-and there wasnt one rivet to be found where it was wanted.We had plates that would do, but nothing to fasten them with.And every week the messenger, a lone negro, letter-bag on shoulder and staff in hand, left our station for the coast.And several times a week a coast caravan came in with trade goods-ghastly glazed calico that made you shudder only to look at it, glass beads value about a penny a quart, confounded spotted cotton handkerchiefs.And no rivets.Three carriers could have brought all that was wanted to set that steamboat afoat.

He was becoming confidential now, but I fancy my unresponsive attitude must have exasperated him at last, for he judged it necessary to inform me he feared neither God nor devil, let alone any mere man. I said I could see that very well, but what I wanted was a certain quantity of rivets-and rivets were what really Mr.Kurtz wanted, if he had only known it.Now letters went to the coast every week……‘My dear sir，’he cried，‘I write from dictation.’I demanded rivets.There was a way-for an intelligent man.He changed his manner；became very cold, and suddenly began to talk about a hippopotamus；wondered whether sleeping on board the steamer（I stuck to my salvage night and day）I wasn‘t disturbed.There was an old hippo that had the bad habit of getting out on the bank and roaming at night over the station grounds.The pilgrims used to turn out in a body and empty every rife they could lay hands on at him.Some even had sat up o’nights for him.All this energy was wasted, though.‘That animal has a charmed life，’he said；‘but you can say this only of brutes in this country.No man-you apprehend me?—no man here bears a charmed life.’He stood there for a moment in the moonlight with his delicate hooked nose set a little askew, and his mica eyes glittering without a wink, then, with a curt Good night, he strode off.I could see he was disturbed and considerably puzzled, which made me feel more hopeful than I had been for days.It was a great comfortto turn from that chap to my infuential friend, the battered, twisted, ruined, tin-pot steamboat.I clambered on board.She rang under my feet like an empty Huntley&Palmers biscuit-tin kicked along a gutter；she was nothing so solid in make, and rather less pretty in shape, but I had expended enough hard work on her to make me love her.No influential friend would have served me better.She had given me a chance to come out a bit-to fnd out what I could do.No, I don‘t like work.I had rather laze about and think of all the fne things that can be done.I don’t like work-no man does-but I like what is in the work-the chance to fnd yourself.Your own reality-for yourself, not for others-what no other man can ever know.They can only see the mere show, and never can tell what it really means.

I was not surprised to see somebody sitting aft, on the deck, with his legs dangling over the mud. You see I rather chummed with the few mechanics there were in that station, whom the other pilgrims naturally despised-on account of their imperfect manners, I suppose.This was the foreman-a boiler-maker by trade-a good worker.He was a lank, bony, yellow-faced man, with big intense eyes.His aspect was worried, and his head was as bald as the palm of my hand；but his hair in falling seemed to have stuck to his chin, and had prospered in the new locality, for his beard hung down to his waist.He was a widower with six young children（he had left them in charge of a sister of his to come out there），and the passion of his life was pigeon-fying.He was an enthusiast and a connoisseur.He would rave about pigeons.After work hours he used sometimes to come over from his hut for a talk about his children and his pigeons；at work, when he had to crawl in the mud under the bottom of the steamboat, he would tie up that beard of his in a kind of white serviette he brought for the purpose.It had loops to go over his ears.In the evening he could be seen squatted on the bank rinsing that wrapper in the creek with great care, then spreading it solemnly on a bush to dry.

I slapped him on the back and shouted，‘We shall have rivets！’He scrambled to his feet exclaiming，‘No！Rivets！’as though he couldn‘t believe his ears. Then in a low voice，’You……eh?‘I don’t know why we behaved like lunatics.I put my fnger to the side of my nose and nodded mysteriously.‘Good for you！’he cried, snapped his fingers above his head, lifting one foot.I tried a jig.We capered on the iron deck.A frightful clatter came out of that empty hulk, and the virgin forest on the other bank of the creek sent it back in a thundering roll upon the sleeping station.It must have made some of the pilgrims sit up in their hovels.A dark fgure obscured the lighted doorway of the manager‘s hut, vanished, then, a second or so after, the doorway itself vanished too.We stopped, and the silence driven away by the stamping of our feet fowed back again from the recesses of the land.The great wall of vegetation, an exuberant and entangled mass of trunks, branches, leaves, boughs, festoons, motionless in the moonlight, was like a rioting invasion of soundless life, a rolling wave of plants, piled up, crested, ready to topple over the creek, to sweep every little man of us out of his little existence.And it moved not.A deadened burst of mighty splashes and snorts reached us from afar, as though an ichthyosaurus had been taking a bath of glitter in the great river.’After all，‘said the boiler-maker in a reasonable tone，’why shouldn‘t we get the rivets?’Why not, indeed！I did not know of any reason why we shouldn‘t.’They‘ll come in three weeks，’I said, confdently.

But they didnt. Instead of rivets there came an invasion, an infliction, a visitation.It came in sections during the next three weeks, each section headed by a donkey carrying a white man in new clothes and tan shoes, bowing from that elevation right and left to the impressed pilgrims.A quarrelsome band of footsore sulky niggers trod on the heels of the donkey；a lot of tents, camp-stools, tin boxes, white cases, brown bales would be shot down in the courtyard, and the air of mystery woulddeepen a little over the muddle of the station.Five such instalments came, with their absurd air of disorderly fight with the loot of innumerable outft shops and provision stores, that, one would think, they were lugging, after a raid, into the wilderness for equitable division.It was an inextricable mess of things decent in themselves but that human folly made look like the spoils of thieving.

This devoted band called itself the Eldorado Exploring Expedition, and I believe they were sworn to secrecy. Their talk, however, was the talk of sordid buccaneers：it was reckless without hardihood, greedy without audacity, and cruel without courage；there was not an atom of foresight or of serious intention in the whole batch of them, and they did not seem aware these things are wanted for the work of the world.To tear treasure out of the bowels of the land was their desire, with no more moral purpose at the back of it than there is in burglars breaking into a safe.Who paid the expenses of the noble enterprise I dont know；but the uncle of our manager was leader of that lot.

In exterior he resembled a butcher in a poor neighbourhood, and his eyes had a look of sleepy cunning. He carried his fat paunch with ostentation on his short legs, and during the time his gang infested the station spoke to no one but his nephew.You could see these two roaming about all day long with their heads close together in an everlasting confab.

“I had given up worrying myself about the rivets. One‘s capacity for that kind of folly is more limited than you would suppose.I said Hang！—and let things slide.I had plenty of time for meditation, and now and then I would give some thought to Kurtz.I wasn’t very interested in him.No.Still, I was curious to see whether this man, who had come out equipped with moral ideas of some sort, would climb to the top after all, and how he would set about his work when there.”





Chapter Two


One evening as I was lying flat on the deck of my steamboat, I heard voices approaching-and there were the nephew and the uncle strolling along the bank. I laid my head on my arm again, and had nearly lost myself in a doze, when somebody said in my ear, as it were：‘I am as harmless as a little child, but I don’t like to be dictated to.Am I the manager-or am I not?I was ordered to send him there.It‘s incredible.’……I became aware that the two were standing on the shore alongside the forepart of the steamboat, just below my head.I did not move；it did not occur to me to move：I was sleepy.‘It is unpleasant，’grunted the uncle.‘He has asked the Administration to be sent there，’said the other，‘with the idea of showing what he could do；and I was instructed accordingly.Look at the infuence that man must have.Is it not frightful?’They both agreed it was frightful, then made several bizarre remarks：‘Make rain and fne weather-one man-the Council-by the nose’—bits of absurd sentences that got the better of my drowsiness, so that I had pretty near the whole of my wits about me when the uncle said，‘The climate may do away with this diffculty for you.Is he alone there?’‘Yes，’answered the manager；he sent his assistant down the river with a note to me in these terms：Clear this poor devil out of the country, and don‘t bother sending more of that sort.I had rather be alone than have the kind of men you can dispose of with me.It was more than a year ago.Can you imagine such impudence！’‘Anything since then?’asked the other, hoarsely.‘Ivory，’jerked out the nephew；‘lots of it-prime sort-lots-most annoying, from him.’‘And with that?’questioned the heavy rumble.‘Invoice，’was the reply fred out, so to speak.Then silence.They had been talking about Kurtz.

“I was broad awake by this time, but, lying perfectly at ease, remained still, having no inducement to change my position.‘How did that ivory come all this way?’growled the elder man, who seemed very vexed. The other explained that it had come with a feet of canoes in charge of an English half-caste clerk Kurtz had with him；that Kurtz had apparently intended to return himself, the station being by that time bare of goods and stores, but after coming three hundred miles, had suddenly decided to go back, which he started to do alone in a small dug-out with four paddlers, leaving the half-caste to continue down the river with the ivory.The two fellows there seemed astounded at anybody attempting such a thing.They were at a loss for an adequate motive.As to me, I seemed to see Kurtz for the frst time.It was a distinct glimpse：the dug-out, four paddling savages, and the lone white man turning his back suddenly on the headquarters, on relief, on thoughts of home-perhaps；setting his face towards the depths of the wilderness, towards his empty and desolate station.I did not know the motive.Perhaps he was just simply a fne fellow who stuck to his work for its own sake.His name, you understand, had not been pronounced once.He was‘that man.’The half-caste, who, as far as I could see, had conducted a difficult trip with great prudence and pluck, was invariably alluded to as‘that scoundrel.’The‘scoundrel’had reported that the‘man’had been very ill-had recovered imperfectly……The two below me moved away then a few paces, and strolled back and forth at some little distance.I heard：‘Military post-doctor-two hundred miles-quite alone now-unavoidable delays-nine months-no news-strange rumours.’They approached again, just as the manager was saying，‘Noone, as far as I know, unless a species of wandering trader-a pestilential fellow, snapping ivory from the natives.’Who was it they were talking about now?I gathered in snatches that this was some man supposed to be in Kurtz‘s district, and of whom the manager did not approve.’We will not be free from unfair competition till one of these fellows is hanged for an example，‘he said.’Certainly，‘grunted the other；’get him hanged！Why not?Anything-anything can be done in this country.That‘s what I say；nobody here, you understand, here, can endanger your position.And why?You stand the climate-you outlast them all.The danger is in Europe；but there before I left I took care to—’They moved off and whispered, then their voices rose again.‘The extraordinary series of delays is not my fault.I did my possible.’The fat man sighed，‘Very sad.’‘And the pestiferous absurdity of his talk，’continued the other；he bothered me enough when he was here.”Each station should be like a beacon on the road towards better things, a centre for trade of course, but also for humanising, improving, instructing.Conceive you-that ass！And he wants to be manager！No, it‘s—’Here he got choked by excessive indignation, and I lifted my head the least bit.I was surprised to see how near they were-right under me.I could have spat upon their hats.They were looking on the ground, absorbed in thought.The manager was switching his leg with a slender twig：his sagacious relative lifted his head.‘You have been well since you came out this time?’he asked.The other gave a start.‘Who?I?Oh！Like a charm-like a charm.But the rest-oh, my goodness！All sick.They die so quick, too, that I haven’t the time to send them out of the country-it‘s incredible！’‘H’m.Just so，‘grunted the uncle.’Ah！my boy, trust to this-I say, trust to this.I saw him extend his short fipper of an arm for a gesture that took in the forest, the creek, the mud, the river-seemed to beckon with a dishonouring fourish before the sunlit face of the land a treacherous appeal to the lurking death, to the hidden evil, tothe profound darkness of its heart.It was so startling that I leaped to my feet and looked back at the edge of the forest, as though I had expected an answer of some sort to that black display of confdence.You know the foolish notions that come to one sometimes.The high stillness confronted these two fgures with its ominous patience, waiting for the passing away of a fantastic invasion.

They swore aloud together-out of sheer fright, I believe-then pretending not to know anything of my existence, turned back to the station. The sun was low；and leaning forward side by side, they seemed to be tugging painfully uphill their two ridiculous shadows of unequal length, that trailed behind them slowly over the tall grass without bending a single blade.

In a few days the Eldorado Expedition went into the patient wilderness, that closed upon it as the sea closes over a diver. Long afterwards the news came that all the donkeys were dead.I know nothing as to the fate of the less valuable animals.They, no doubt, like the rest of us, found what they deserved.I did not inquire.I was then rather excited at the prospect of meeting Kurtz very soon.When I say very soon I mean it comparatively.It was just two months from the day we left the creek when we came to the bank below Kurtzs station.

“Going up that river was like travelling back to the earliest beginnings of the world, when vegetation rioted on the earth and the big trees were kings. An empty stream, a great silence, an impenetrable forest.The air was warm, thick, heavy, sluggish.There was no joy in the brilliance of sunshine.The long stretches of the waterway ran on, deserted, into the gloom of overshadowed distances.On silvery sandbanks hippos and alligators sunned themselves side by side.The broadening waters flowed through a mob of wooded islands；you lost your way on that river as you would in a desert, and butted all day long against shoals, trying to fnd the channel, till you thought yourself bewitched and cut off for ever from everything you had known once-somewhere-far away-in another existence perhaps.There were moments when one‘s past came back to one, as it will sometimes when you have not a moment to spare to yourself；but it came in the shape of an unrestful and noisy dream, remembered with wonder amongst the overwhelming realities of this strange world of plants, and water, and silence.And this stillness of life did not in the least resemble a peace.It was the stillness of an implacable force brooding over an inscrutable intention.It looked at you with a vengeful aspect.I got used to it afterwards；I did not see it any more；I had no time.I had to keep guessing at the channel；I had to discern, mostly by inspiration, the signs of hidden banks；I watched for sunken stones；I was learning to clap my teeth smartly before my heart few out, when I shaved by a fuke some infernal sly old snag that would have ripped the life out of the tin-pot steamboat and drowned all the pilgrims；I had to keep a look-out for the signs of dead wood we could cut up in the night for next day’s steaming.When you have to attend to things of that sort, to the mere incidents of the surface, the reality-the reality, I tell you-fades.The inner truth is hidden-luckily, luckily.But I felt it all the same；I felt often its mysterious stillness watching me at my monkey tricks, just as it watches you fellows performing on your respective tight-ropes for-what is it?half-a-crown a tumble—”

“Try to be civil, Marlow，”growled a voice, and I knew there was at least one listener awake besides myself.

I beg your pardon. I forgot the heartache which makes up the rest of the price.And indeed what does the price matter, if the trick be well done?You do your tricks very well.And I didn‘t do badly either, since I managed not to sink that steamboat on my first trip.It’s a wonder to me yet.Imagine a blindfolded man set to drive a van over a bad road.I sweated and shivered over that business considerably, I can tell you.After all, for a seaman, to scrape the bottom of the thing that‘s supposed to foat all the time under his care is the unpardonable sin.No one may know of it, but you never forget the thump-eh?A blow on the very heart.You remember it, you dream of it, you wake up at night and think of it-years after-and go hot and cold all over.I don’t pretend to say that steamboat foated all the time.More than once she had to wade for a bit, with twenty cannibals splashing around and pushing.We had enlisted some of these chaps on the way for a crew.Fine fellows-cannibals-in their place.They were men one could work with, and I am grateful to them.And, after all, they did not eat each other before my face：they had brought along a provision of hippo-meat which went rotten, and made the mystery of the wilderness stink in my nostrils.Phoo！I can sniff it now.I had the manager on board and three or four pilgrims with their staves-all complete.Sometimes we came upon a station close by the bank, clinging to the skirts of the Unknown, and the white men rushing out of a tumble-down hovel, with great gestures of joy and surprise and welcome, seemed very strange-had the appearance of being held there captive by a spell.The word‘ivory’would ring in the air for a while-and on we went again into the silence, along empty reaches, round the still bends, between the high walls of our winding way, reverberating in hollow claps the ponderous beat of the stern-wheel.Trees, trees, millions of trees, massive, immense, running up high；and at their foot, hugging the bank against the stream, crept the little begrimed steamboat, like a sluggish beetle crawling on the foor of a lofty portico.It made you feel very small, very lost, and yet it was not altogether depressing that feeling.After all, if you were small, the grimy beetle crawled on-which was just what you wanted it to do.Where the pilgrims imagined it crawled to I dont know.To some place where they expected to get something, I bet！For me it crawled towards Kurtz-exclusively；but when the steam-pipes started leaking we crawled very slow.The reaches opened before us and closed behind, as if the forest had stepped leisurely across the water to bar the way for our return.We penetrated deeper and deeper into the heart of darkness.It was very quiet there.At night sometimes the roll of drums behind the curtain of trees would run up the river and remain sustained faintly, as if hovering in the air high over our heads, till the first break of day.Whether this meant war, peace, or prayer we could not tell.The dawns were heralded by the descent of a chill stillness；the woodcutters slept, their fres burned low；the snapping of a twig would make you start.We were wanderers on a prehistoric earth, on an earth that wore the aspect of an unknown planet.We could have fancied ourselves the frst of men taking possession of an accursed inheritance, to be subdued at the cost of profound anguish and of excessive toil.But suddenly, as we struggled round a bend, there would be a glimpse of rush walls, of peaked grass-roofs, a burst of yells, a whirl of black limbs, a mass of hands clapping, of feet stamping, of bodies swaying, of eyes rolling, under the droop of heavy and motionless foliage.The steamer toiled along slowly on the edge of a black and incomprehensible frenzy.The prehistoric man was cursing us, praying to us, welcoming us-who could tell?We were cut off from the comprehension of our surroundings；we glided past like phantoms, wondering and secretly appalled, as sane men would be before an enthusiastic outbreak in a madhouse.We could not understand, because we were too far and could not remember, because we were travelling in the night of frst ages, of those ages that are gone, leaving hardly a sign-and no memories.

The earth seemed unearthly. We are accustomed to look upon the shackled form of a conquered monster, but there-there you could look at a thing monstrous and free.It was unearthly, and the men were-No, they were not inhuman.Well, you know, that was the worst of it-this suspicion of their not being inhuman.It would come slowly to one.They howled, and leaped, and spun, and made horrid faces；but what thrilled you was just the thought of their humanity-like yours-the thought of your remote kinship with this wild and passionate uproar.Ugly.Yes, it was ugly enough；but if you were man enough you would admit to yourself that there was in you just the faintest trace of a response to the terrible frankness of that noise, a dim suspicion of there being a meaning in it which you-you so remote from the night of first ages-could comprehend.And why not?The mind of man is capable of anything-because everything is in it, all the past as well as all the future.What was there after all?Joy, fear, sorrow, devotion, valour, rage-who can tell?—but truth-truth stripped of its cloak of time.Let the fool gape and shudder-the man knows, and can look on without a wink.But he must at least be as much of a man as these on the shore.He must meet that truth with his own true stuff-with his own inborn strength.Principles?Principles won‘t do.Acquisitions, clothes, pretty rags-rags that would fy off at the frst good shake.No；you want a deliberate belief.An appeal to me in this fendish row-is there?Very well；I hear；I admit, but I have a voice too, and for good or evil mine is the speech that cannot be silenced.Of course, a fool, what with sheer fright and fine sentiments, is always safe.Who’s that grunting?You wonder I didn‘t go ashore for a howl and a dance?Well, no-I didn’t.Fine sentiments, you say?Fine sentiments, be hanged！I had no time.I had to mess about with white-lead and strips of woollen blanket helping to put bandages on those leaky steam-pipes-I tell you.I had to watch the steering, and circumvent those snags, and get the tin-pot along by hook or by crook.There was surface-truth enough in these things to save a wiser man.And between whiles I had to look after the savage who was fireman.He was an improved specimen；he couldfre up a vertical boiler.He was there below me, and, upon my word, to look at him was as edifying as seeing a dog in a parody of breeches and a feather hat, walking on his hind-legs.A few months of training had done for that really fne chap.He squinted at the steam-gauge and at the water-gauge with an evident effort of intrepidity-and he had fled teeth too, the poor devil, and the wool of his pate shaved into queer patterns, and three ornamental scars on each of his cheeks.He ought to have been clapping his hands and stamping his feet on the bank, instead of which he was hard at work, a thrall to strange witchcraft, full of improving knowledge.He was useful because he had been instructed；and what he knew was this-that should the water in that transparent thing disappear, the evil spirit inside the boiler would get angry through the greatness of his thirst, and take a terrible vengeance.So he sweated and fred up and watched the glass fearfully（with an impromptu charm, made of rags, tied to his arm, and a piece of polished bone, as big as a watch, stuck fatways through his lower lip），while the wooded banks slipped past us slowly, the short noise was left behind, the interminable miles of silence-and we crept on, towards Kurtz.But the snags were thick, the water was treacherous and shallow, the boiler seemed indeed to have a sulky devil in it, and thus neither that freman nor I had any time to peer into our creepy thoughts.

Some fifty miles below the Inner Station we came upon a hut of reeds, an inclined and melancholy pole, with the unrecognisable tatters of what had been a fag of some sort fying from it, and a neatly stacked wood-pile. This was unexpected.We came to the bank, and on the stack of frewood found a fat piece of board with some faded pencil-writing on it.When deciphered it said：‘Wood for you.Hurry up.Approach cautiously.’There was a signature, but it was illegible-not Kurtz-a much longer word.Hurry up.Where?Up the river?‘Approach cautiously.’We had not done so.But the warning could not have been meant for the place whereit could be only found after approach.Something was wrong above.But what-and how much?That was the question.We commented adversely upon the imbecility of that telegraphic style.The bush around said nothing, and would not let us look very far, either.A torn curtain of red twill hung in the doorway of the hut, and fapped sadly in our faces.The dwelling was dismantled；but we could see a white man had lived there not very long ago.There remained a rude table-a plank on two posts；a heap of rubbish reposed in a dark corner, and by the door I picked up a book.It had lost its covers, and the pages had been thumbed into a state of extremely dirty softness；but the back had been lovingly stitched afresh with white cotton thread, which looked clean yet.It was an extraordinary find.Its title was，‘An Inquiry into some Points of Seamanship，’by a man Towzer, Towson-some such name-Master in his Majesty‘s Navy.The matter looked dreary reading enough, with illustrative diagrams and repulsive tables of figures, and the copy was sixty years old.I handled this amazing antiquity with the greatest possible tenderness, lest it should dissolve in my hands.Within, Towson or Towzer was inquiring earnestly into the breaking strain of ships’chains and tackle, and other such matters.Not a very enthralling book；but at the frst glance you could see there a singleness of intention, an honest concern for the right way of going to work, which made these humble pages, thought out so many years ago, luminous with another than a professional light.The simple old sailor, with his talk of chains and purchases, made me forget the jungle and the pilgrims in a delicious sensation of having come upon something unmistakably real.Such a book being there was wonderful enough；but still more astounding were the notes pencilled in the margin, and plainly referring to the text.I couldnt believe my eyes！They were in cipher！Yes, it looked like cipher.Fancy a man lugging with him a book of that description into this nowhere and studying it-and making notes-incipher at that！It was an extravagant mystery.

I had been dimly aware for some time of a worrying noise, and when I lifted my eyes I saw the wood-pile was gone, and the manager, aided by all the pilgrims, was shouting at me from the river-side. I slipped the book into my pocket.I assure you to leave off reading was like tearing myself away from the shelter of an old and solid friendship.

I started the lame engine ahead.‘It must be this miserable trader-this intruder，’exclaimed the manager, looking back malevolently at the place we had left.‘He must be English，’I said.‘It will not save him from getting into trouble if he is not careful，’muttered the manager darkly. I observed with assumed innocence that no man was safe from trouble in this world.

The current was more rapid now, the steamer seemed at her last gasp, the stern-wheel flopped languidly, and I caught myself listening on tiptoe for the next beat of the foat, for in sober truth I expected the wretched thing to give up every moment. It was like watching the last fickers of a life.But still we crawled.Sometimes I would pick out a tree a little way ahead to measure our progress towards Kurtz by, but I lost it invariably before we got abreast.To keep the eyes so long on one thing was too much for human patience.The manager displayed a beautiful resignation.I fretted and fumed and took to arguing with myself whether or no I would talk openly with Kurtz；but before I could come to any conclusion it occurred to me that my speech or my silence, indeed any action of mine, would be a mere futility.What did it matter what any one knew or ignored?What did it matter who was manager?One gets sometimes such a flash of insight.The essentials of this affair lay deep under the surface, beyond my reach, and beyond my power of meddling.

Towards the evening of the second day we judged ourselves about eight miles from Kurtz‘s station. I wanted to push on；but the managerlooked grave, and told me the navigation up there was so dangerous that it would be advisable, the sun being very low already, to wait where we were till next morning.Moreover, he pointed out that if the warning to approach cautiously were to be followed, we must approach in daylight-not at dusk, or in the dark.This was sensible enough.Eight miles meant nearly three hours’steaming for us, and I could also see suspicious ripples at the upper end of the reach.Nevertheless, I was annoyed beyond expression at the delay, and most unreasonably too, since one night more could not matter much after so many months.As we had plenty of wood, and caution was the word, I brought up in the middle of the stream.The reach was narrow, straight, with high sides like a railway cutting.The dusk came gliding into it long before the sun had set.The current ran smooth and swift, but a dumb immobility sat on the banks.The living trees, lashed together by the creepers and every living bush of the undergrowth, might have been changed into stone, even to the slenderest twig, to the lightest leaf.It was not sleep-it seemed unnatural, like a state of trance.Not the faintest sound of any kind could be heard.You looked on amazed, and began to suspect yourself of being deaf-then the night came suddenly, and struck you blind as well.About three in the morning some large fish leaped, and the loud splash made me jump as though a gun had been fred.When the sun rose there was a white fog, very warm and clammy, and more blinding than the night.It did not shift or drive；it was just there, standing all round you like something solid.At eight or nine, perhaps, it lifted as a shutter lifts.We had a glimpse of the towering multitude of trees, of the immense matted jungle, with the blazing little ball of the sun hanging over it-all perfectly still-and then the white shutter came down again, smoothly, as if sliding in greased grooves.I ordered the chain, which we had begun to heave in, to be paid out again.Before it stopped running with a muffed rattle, a cry, a veryloud cry, as of infinite desolation, soared slowly in the opaque air.It ceased.A complaining clamour, modulated in savage discords, flled our ears.The sheer unexpectedness of it made my hair stir under my cap.I don‘t know how it struck the others：to me it seemed as though the mist itself had screamed, so suddenly, and apparently from all sides at once, did this tumultuous and mournful uproar arise.It culminated in a hurried outbreak of almost intolerably excessive shrieking, which stopped short, leaving us stiffened in a variety of silly attitudes, and obstinately listening to the nearly as appalling and excessive silence.’Good God！What is the meaning—?‘stammered at my elbow one of the pilgrims-a little fat man, with sandy hair and red whiskers, who wore side-spring boots, and pink pyjamas tucked into his socks.Two others remained open-mouthed a whole minute, then dashed into the little cabin, to rush out incontinently and stand darting scared glances, with Winchesters at’readyin their hands.What we could see was just the steamer we were on, her outlines blurred as though she had been on the point of dissolving, and a misty strip of water, perhaps two feet broad, around her-and that was all.The rest of the world was nowhere, as far as our eyes and ears were concerned.Just nowhere.Gone, disappeared；swept off without leaving a whisper or a shadow behind.

I went forward, and ordered the chain to be hauled in short, so as to be ready to trip the anchor and move the steamboat at once if necessary.‘Will they attack?’whispered an awed voice.‘We will be all butchered in this fog，’murmured another. The faces twitched with the strain, the hands trembled slightly, the eyes forgot to wink.It was very curious to see the contrast of expressions of the white men and of the black fellows of our crew, who were as much strangers to that part of the river as we, though their homes were only eight hundred miles away.The whites, of course greatly discomposed, had besides a curious look of beingpainfully shocked by such an outrageous row.The others had an alert, naturally interested expression；but their faces were essentially quiet, even those of the one or two who grinned as they hauled at the chain.Several exchanged short, grunting phrases, which seemed to settle the matter to their satisfaction.Their headman, a young, broad-chested black, severely draped in dark-blue fringed cloths, with fierce nostrils and his hair all done up artfully in oily ringlets, stood near me.‘Aha！’I said nodding, just for good fellowship‘s sake.’Catch‘im，’he snapped, with a bloodshot widening of his eyes and a fash of sharp teeth—‘catch’im.Give‘im to us.’‘To you, eh?’I asked；‘what would you do with them?’‘Eat’im！‘he said curtly, and, leaning his elbow on the rail, looked out into the fog in a dignifed and profoundly pensive attitude.I would no doubt have been properly horrifed, had it not occurred to me that he and his chaps must be very hungry：that they must have been growing increasingly hungry for at least this month past.They had been engaged for six months（I don’t think a single one of them had any clear idea of time, as we at the end of countless ages have.They still belonged to the beginnings of time-had no inherited experience to teach them as it were），and of course, as long as there was a piece of paper written over in accordance with some farcical law or other made down the river, it didn‘t enter anybody’s head to trouble how they would live.Certainly they had brought with them some rotten hippo-meat, which couldn‘t have lasted very long, anyway, even if the pilgrims hadn’t, in the midst of a shocking hullabaloo, thrown a considerable quantity of it overboard.It looked like a high-handed proceeding；but it was really a case of legitimate self-defence.You can‘t breathe dead hippo waking, sleeping, and eating, and at the same time keep your precarious grip on existence.Besides that, they had given them every week three pieces of brass wire, each about nine inches long；and the theory was they were to buy their provisions with that currency inriver-side villages.You can see how that worked.There were either no villages, or the people were hostile, or the director, who like the rest of us fed out of tins, with an occasional old he-goat thrown in, didn’t want to stop the steamer for some more or less recondite reason.So, unless they swallowed the wire itself, or made loops of it to snare the fsh with, I don‘t see what good their extravagant salary could be to them.I must say it was paid with a regularity worthy of a large and honourable trading company.For the rest, the only thing to eat-though it didn’t look eatable in the least-I saw in their possession was a few lumps of some stuff like half-cooked cold dough, of a dirty lavender colour, they kept wrapped in leaves, and now and then swallowed a piece of, but so small that it seemed done more for the looks of the thing than for any serious purpose of sustenance.Why in the name of all the gnawing devils of hunger they didn‘t go for us-they were thirty to fve-and have a good tuck in for once, amazes me now when I think of it.They were big powerful men, with not much capacity to weigh the consequences, with courage, with strength, even yet, though their skins were no longer glossy and their muscles no longer hard.And I saw that something restraining, one of those human secrets that baffe probability, had come into play there.I looked at them with a swift quickening of interest-not because it occurred to me I might be eaten by them before very long, though I own to you that just then I perceived-in a new light, as it were-how unwholesome the pilgrims looked, and I hoped, yes, I positively hoped, that my aspect was not so-what shall I say?—so-unappetising：a touch of fantastic vanity which ftted well with the dream-sensation that pervaded all my days at that time.Perhaps I had a little fever too.One can’t live with one‘s fnger everlastingly on one’s pulse.I had often a‘little fever，’or a little touch of other things-the playful pawstrokes of the wilderness, the preliminary trifing before the more serious onslaught which came in due course.Yes；Ilooked at them as you would on any human being, with a curiosity of their impulses, motives, capacities, weaknesses, when brought to the test of an inexorable physical necessity.Restraint！What possible restraint?Was it superstition, disgust, patience, fear-or some kind of primitive honour?No fear can stand up to hunger, no patience can wear it out, disgust simply does not exist where hunger is；and as to superstition, beliefs, and what you may call principles, they are less than chaff in a breeze.Don‘t you know the devilry of lingering starvation, its exasperating torment, its black thoughts, its sombre and brooding ferocity?Well, I do.It takes a man all his inborn strength to fight hunger properly.It’s really easier to face bereavement, dishonour, and the perdition of ones soul-than this kind of prolonged hunger.Sad, but true.And these chaps too had no earthly reason for any kind of scruple.Restraint！I would just as soon have expected restraint from a hyena prowling amongst the corpses of a battlefeld.But there was the fact facing me-the fact dazzling, to be seen, like the foam on the depths of the sea, like a ripple on an unfathomable enigma, a mystery greater-when I thought of it-than the curious, inexplicable note of desperate grief in this savage clamour that had swept by us on the river-bank, behind the blind whiteness of a fog.

Two pilgrims were quarrelling in hurried whispers as to which bank.‘Left.’‘No, no；how can you?Right, right, of course.’‘It is very serious, very serious’said the manager‘s voice behind me；’I would be desolated if anything should happen to Mr. Kurtz before we came up.‘I looked at him, and had not the slightest doubt he was sincere.He was just the kind of man who would wish to preserve appearances.That was his restraint.But when he muttered something about going on at once, I did not even take the trouble to answer him.I knew, and he knew, that it was impossible.Were we to let go our hold of the bottom, we would be absolutely in the air-in space.We wouldn’t be able to tell where we weregoing to-whether up or down stream, or across-till we fetched against one bank or the other-and then we wouldn‘t know at frst which it was.Of course I made no move.I had no mind for a smash-up.You couldn’t imagine a more deadly place for a shipwreck.Whether drowned at once or not, we were sure to perish speedily in one way or another.‘I authorise you to take all the risks，’he said, after a short silence.‘I refuse to take any，’I said shortly；which was just the answer he expected, though its tone might have surprised him.‘Well, I must defer to your judgment.You are captain，’he said, with marked civility.I turned my shoulder to him in sign of my appreciation, and looked into the fog.How long would it last?It was the most hopeless look-out.The approach to this Kurtz grubbing for ivory in the wretched bush was beset by as many dangers as though he had been an enchanted princess sleeping in a fabulous castle.‘Will they attack, do you think?’asked the manager, in a confdential tone.

I did not think they would attack, for several obvious reasons. The thick fog was one.If they left the bank in their canoes they would get lost in it, as we would be if we attempted to move.Still, I had also judged the jungle of both banks quite impenetrable-and yet eyes were in it, eyes that had seen us.The river-side bushes were certainly very thick；but the undergrowth behind was evidently penetrable.However, during the short lift I had seen no canoes anywhere in the reach-certainly not abreast of the steamer.But what made the idea of attack inconceivable to me was the nature of the noise-of the cries we had heard.They had not the ferce character boding of immediate hostile intention.Unexpected, wild, and violent as they had been, they had given me an irresistible impression of sorrow.The glimpse of the steamboat had for some reason filled those savages with unrestrained grief.The danger, if any, I expounded, was from our proximity to a great human passion let loose.Even extreme grief may ultimately vent itself in violence-but more generally takes the formof apathy……

You should have seen the pilgrims stare！They had no heart to grin, or even to revile me；but I believe they thought me gone mad-with fright, maybe. I delivered a regular lecture.My dear boys, it was no good bothering.Keep a look-out?Well, you may guess I watched the fog for the signs of lifting as a cat watches a mouse；but for anything else our eyes were of no more use to us than if we had been buried miles deep in a heap of cotton-wool.It felt like it too-choking, warm, stifing.Besides, all I said, though it sounded extravagant, was absolutely true to fact.What we afterwards alluded to as an attack was really an attempt at repulse.The action was very far from being aggressive-it was not even defensive, in the usual sense：it was undertaken under the stress of desperation, and in its essence was purely protective.

It developed itself, I should say, two hours after the fog lifted, and its commencement was at a spot, roughly speaking, about a mile and a half below Kurtz‘s station. We had just floundered and flopped round a bend, when I saw an islet, a mere grassy hummock of bright green, in the middle of the stream.It was the only thing of the kind；but as we opened the reach more, I perceived it was the head of a long sandbank, or rather of a chain of shallow patches stretching down the middle of the river.They were discoloured, just awash, and the whole lot was seen just under the water, exactly as a man’s backbone is seen running down the middle of his back under the skin.Now, as far as I did see, I could go to the right or to the left of this.I didnt know either channel, of course.The banks looked pretty well alike, the depth appeared the same；but as I had been informed the station was on the west side, I naturally headed for the western passage.

No sooner had we fairly entered it than I became aware it was much narrower than I had supposed. To the left of us there was the longuninterrupted shoal, and to the right a high, steep bank heavily overgrown with bushes.Above the bush the trees stood in serried ranks.The twigs overhung the current thickly, and from distance to distance a large limb of some tree projected rigidly over the stream.It was then well on in the afternoon, the face of the forest was gloomy, and a broad strip of shadow had already fallen on the water.In this shadow we steamed up-very slowly, as you may imagine.I sheered her well inshore-the water being deepest near the bank, as the sounding-pole informed me.

One of my hungry and forbearing friends was sounding in the bows just below me. This steamboat was exactly like a decked scow.On the deck there were two little teak-wood houses, with doors and windows.The boiler was in the fore-end, and the machinery right astern.Over the whole there was a light roof, supported on stanchions.The funnel projected through that roof, and just in front of the funnel a small cabin built of light planks served for a pilot-house.It contained a couch, two camp-stools, a loaded Martini-Henry leaning in one corner, a tiny table, and the steering-wheel.It had a wide door in front and a broad shutter at each side.All these were always thrown open, of course.I spent my days perched up there on the extreme fore-end of that roof, before the door.At night I slept, or tried to, on the couch.An athletic black belonging to some coast tribe, and educated by my poor predecessor, was the helmsman.He sported a pair of brass earrings, wore a blue cloth wrapper from the waist to the ankles, and thought all the world of himself.He was the most unstable kind of fool I had ever seen.He steered with no end of a swagger while you were by；but if he lost sight of you, he became instantly the prey of an abject funk, and would let that cripple of a steamboat get the upper hand of him in a minute.

I was looking down at the sounding-pole, and feeling much annoyed to see at each try a little more of it stick out of that river, when I saw mypoleman give up the business suddenly, and stretch himself flat on the deck, without even taking the trouble to haul his pole in. He kept hold on it though, and it trailed in the water.At the same time the fireman, whom I could also see below me, sat down abruptly before his furnace and ducked his head.I was amazed.Then I had to look at the river mighty quick, because there was a snag in the fairway.Sticks, little sticks, were fying about-thick：they were whizzing before my nose, dropping below me, striking behind me against my pilot-house.All this time the river, the shore, the woods, were very quiet-perfectly quiet.I could only hear the heavy splashy thump of the stern-wheel and the patter of these things.We cleared the snag clumsily.Arrows, by Jove！We were being shot at！I stepped in quickly to close the shutter on the land-side.That fool-helmsman, his hands on the spokes, was lifting his knees high, stamping his feet, champing his mouth, like a reined-in horse.Confound him！And we were staggering within ten feet of the bank.I had to lean right out to swing the heavy shutter, and I saw a face amongst the leaves on the level with my own, looking at me very ferce and steady；and then suddenly, as though a veil had been removed from my eyes, I made out, deep in the tangled gloom, naked breasts, arms, legs, glaring eyes-the bush was swarming with human limbs in movement, glistening, of bronze colour.The twigs shook, swayed, and rustled, the arrows few out of them, and then the shutter came to.‘Steer her straight，’I said to the helmsman.He held his head rigid, face forward；but his eyes rolled, he kept on lifting and setting down his feet gently, his mouth foamed a little.‘Keep quiet！’I said in a fury.I might just as well have ordered a tree not to sway in the wind.I darted out.Below me there was a great scuffe of feet on the iron deck；confused exclamations；a voice screamed，‘Can you turn back?’I caught sight of a V-shaped ripple on the water ahead.What?Another snag！A fusillade burst out under my feet.The pilgrims had opened frewith their Winchesters, and were simply squirting lead into that bush.A deuce of a lot of smoke came up and drove slowly forward.I swore at it.Now I couldn‘t see the ripple or the snag either.I stood in the doorway, peering, and the arrows came in swarms.They might have been poisoned, but they looked as though they wouldn’t kill a cat.The bush began to howl.Our wood-cutters raised a warlike whoop；the report of a rife just at my back deafened me.I glanced over my shoulder, and the pilot-house was yet full of noise and smoke when I made a dash at the wheel.The fool-nigger had dropped everything, to throw the shutter open and let off that Martini-Henry.He stood before the wide opening, glaring, and I yelled at him to come back, while I straightened the sudden twist out of that steamboat.There was no room to turn even if I had wanted to, the snag was somewhere very near ahead in that confounded smoke, there was no time to lose, so I just crowded her into the bank-right into the bank, where I knew the water was deep.

We tore slowly along the overhanging bushes in a whirl of broken twigs and flying leaves. The fusillade below stopped short, as I had foreseen it would when the squirts got empty.I threw my head back to a glinting whizz that traversed the pilot-house, in at one shutter-hole and out at the other.Looking past that mad helmsman, who was shaking the empty rife and yelling at the shore, I saw vague forms of men running bent double, leaping, gliding, distinct, incomplete, evanescent.Something big appeared in the air before the shutter, the rifle went overboard, and the man stepped back swiftly, looked at me over his shoulder in an extraordinary, profound, familiar manner, and fell upon my feet.The side of his head hit the wheel twice, and the end of what appeared a long cane clattered round and knocked over a little camp-stool.It looked as though after wrenching that thing from somebody ashore he had lost his balance in the effort.The thin smoke had blown away, we were clear of the snag, and looking ahead I could see that in another hundred yards or so I would be free to sheer off, away from the bank；but my feet felt so very warm and wet that I had to look down.The man had rolled on his back and stared straight up at me；both his hands clutched that cane.It was the shaft of a spear that, either thrown or lounged through the opening, had caught him in the side just below the ribs；the blade had gone in out of sight, after making a frightful gash；my shoes were full；a pool of blood lay very still, gleaming dark-red under the wheel；his eyes shone with an amazing lustre.The fusillade burst out again.He looked at me anxiously, gripping the spear like something precious, with an air of being afraid I would try to take it away from him.I had to make an effort to free my eyes from his gaze and attend to the steering.With one hand I felt above my head for the line of the steam-whistle, and jerked out screech after screech hurriedly.The tumult of angry and warlike yells was checked instantly, and then from the depths of the woods went out such a tremulous and prolonged wail of mournful fear and utter despair as may be imagined to follow the flight of the last hope from the earth.There was a great commotion in the bush；the shower of arrows stopped, a few dropping shots rang out sharply-then silence, in which the languid beat of the stern-wheel came plainly to my ears.I put the helm hard a-starboard at the moment when the pilgrim in pink pyjamas, very hot and agitated, appeared in the doorway.‘The manager sends me—’he began in an offcial tone, and stopped short.‘Good God！’he said, glaring at the wounded man.

We two whites stood over him, and his lustrous and inquiring glance enveloped us both. I declare it looked as though he would presently put to us some question in an understandable language；but he died without uttering a sound, without moving a limb, without twitching a muscle.Only in the very last moment, as though in response to some sign we could not see, to some whisper we could not hear, he frowned heavily, and that frown gave to his black death-mask an inconceivably somber, brooding, and menacing expression.The lustre of inquiring glance faded swiftly into vacant glassiness.‘Can you steer?’I asked the agent eagerly.He looked very dubious；but I made a grab at his arm, and he understood at once I meant him to steer whether or no.To tell you the truth, I was morbidly anxious to change my shoes and socks.‘He is dead，’murmured the fellow, immensely impressed.‘No doubt about it，’said I, tugging like mad at the shoe-laces.‘And, by the way, I suppose Mr.Kurtz is dead as well by this time.’

For the moment that was the dominant thought. There was a sense of extreme disappointment, as though I had found out I had been striving after something altogether without a substance.I couldn‘t have been more disgusted if I had travelled all this way for the sole purpose of talking with Mr.Kurtz.Talking with……I flung one shoe overboard, and became aware that that was exactly what I had been looking forward to-a talk with Kurtz.I made the strange discovery that I had never imagined him as doing, you know, but as discoursing.I didn’t say to myself，‘Now I will never see him，’or‘Now I will never shake him by the hand，’but，‘Now I will never hear him.’The man presented himself as a voice.Not of course that I did not connect him with some sort of action.Hadnt I been told in all the tones of jealousy and admiration that he had collected, bartered, swindled, or stolen more ivory than all the other agents together.That was not the point.The point was in his being a gifted creature, and that of all his gifts the one that stood out pre-eminently, that carried with it a sense of real presence, was his ability to talk, his words-the gift of expression, the bewildering, the illuminating, the most exalted and the most contemptible, the pulsating stream of light, or the deceitful flow from the heart of an impenetrable darkness.

“The other shoe went flying unto the devil-god of that river. Ithought，‘By Jove！it’s all over.We are too late；he has vanished-the gift has vanished, by means of some spear, arrow, or club.I will never hear that chap speak after all-and my sorrow had a startling extravagance of emotion, even such as I had noticed in the howling sorrow of these savages in the bush.I couldn‘t have felt more of lonely desolation somehow, had I been robbed of a belief or had missed my destiny in life……Why do you sigh in this beastly way, somebody?Absurd?Well, absurd.Good Lord！mustn’t a man ever-Here, give me some tobacco……”

There was a pause of profound stillness, then a match flared, and Marlows lean face appeared-worn, hollow, with downward folds and dropped eyelids, with an aspect of concentrated attention；and as he took vigorous draws at his pipe, it seemed to retreat and advance out of the night in the regular ficker of the tiny fame. The match went out.

“Absurd！”he cried.“This is the worst of trying to tell……Here you all are, each moored with two good addresses, like a hulk with two anchors, a butcher round one corner, a policeman round another, excellent appetites, and temperature normal-you hear-normal from year‘s end to year’s end. And you say, Absurd！Absurd be-exploded！Absurd！My dear boys, what can you expect from a man who out of sheer nervousness had just flung overboard a pair of new shoes.Now I think of it, it is amazing I did not shed tears.I am, upon the whole, proud of my fortitude.I was cut to the quick at the idea of having lost the inestimable privilege of listening to the gifted Kurtz.Of course I was wrong.The privilege was waiting for me.Oh yes, I heard more than enough.And I was right, too.A voice.He was very little more than a voice.And I heard-him-it-this voice-other voices-all of them were so little more than voices-and the memory of that time itself lingers around me, impalpable, like a dying vibration of one immense jabber, silly, atrocious, sordid, savage, or simply mean, without any kind of sense.Voices, voices-even the girl herself-now—”

He was silent for a long time.

“I laid the ghost of his gifts at last with a lie，”he began suddenly.Girl！What?Did I mention a girl?Oh, she is out of it-completely. They-the women, I mean-are out of it-should be out of it.We must help them to stay in that beautiful world of their own, lest ours gets worse.Oh, she had to be out of it.You should have heard the disinterred body of Mr.Kurtz saying，‘My Intended.’You would have perceived directly then how completely she was out of it.And the lofty frontal bone of Mr.Kurtz！They say the hair goes on growing sometimes, but this-ah-specimen, was impressively bald.The wilderness had patted him on the head, and, behold, it was like a ball-an ivory ball；it had caressed him, and-lo！—he had withered；it had taken him, loved him, embraced him, got into his veins, consumed his flesh, and sealed his soul to its own by the inconceivable ceremonies of some devilish initiation.He was its spoiled and pampered favourite.Ivory?I should think so.Heaps of it, stacks of it.The old mud shanty was bursting with it.You would think there was not a single tusk left either above or below ground in the whole country.‘Mostly fossil，’the manager had remarked disparagingly.It was no more fossil than I am；but they call it fossil when it is dug up.It appears these niggers do bury the tusks sometimes-but evidently they couldn‘t bury this parcel deep enough to save the gifted Mr.Kurtz from his fate.We filled the steamboat with it, and had to pile a lot on the deck.Thus he could see and enjoy as long as he could see, because the appreciation of this favour had remained with him to the last.You should have heard him say，’My ivory.‘Oh yes, I heard him.’My Intended, my ivory, my station, my river, my—‘Everything belonged to him.It made me hold my breath in expectation of hearing the wilderness burst into a prodigious peal of laughter that would shake the fixed stars in their places.Everythingbelonged to him-but that was a trife.The thing was to know what he belonged to, how many powers of darkness claimed him for their own.That was the refection that made you creepy all over.It was impossible-it was not good for one either-trying to imagine.He had taken a high seat amongst the devils of the land-I mean literally.You can’t understand.How could you?—with solid pavement under your feet, surrounded by kind neighbours ready to cheer you or to fall on you, stepping delicately between the butcher and the policeman, in the holy terror of scandal and gallows and lunatic asylums-how can you imagine what particular region of the frst ages a man‘s untrammeled feet may take him into by the way of solitude-utter solitude without a policeman-by the way of silence, utter silence, where no warning voice of a kind neighbour can be heard whispering of public opinion?These little things make all the great difference.When they are gone you must fall back upon your own innate strength, upon your own capacity for faithfulness.Of course you may be too much of a fool to go wrong-too dull even to know you are being assaulted by the powers of darkness.I take it, no fool ever made a bargain for his soul with the devil：the fool is too much of a fool, or the devil too much of a devil-I don’t know which.Or you may be such a thunderingly exalted creature as to be altogether deaf and blind to anything but heavenly sights and sounds.Then the earth for you is only a standing place-and whether to be like this is your loss or your gain I won‘t pretend to say.But most of us are neither one nor the other.The earth for us is a place to live in, where we must put up with sights, with sounds, with smells too, by Jove！—breathe dead hippo, so to speak, and not be contaminated.And there, don’t you see?your strength comes in, the faith in your ability for the digging of unostentatious holes to bury the stuff in-your power of devotion, not to yourself, but to an obscure, back-breaking business.And that‘s diffcult enough.Mind, I am not trying toexcuse or even explain-I am trying to account to myself for-for-Mr.Kurtz-for the shade of Mr.Kurtz.This initiated wraith from the back of Nowhere honoured me with its amazing confidence before it vanished altogether.This was because it could speak English to me.The original Kurtz had been educated partly in England, and-as he was good enough to say himself-his sympathies were in the right place.His mother was half-English, his father was half-French.All Europe contributed to the making of Kurtz；and by and bye I learned that, most appropriately, the International Society for the Suppression of Savage Customs had intrusted him with the making of a report, for its future guidance.And he had written it too.I’ve seen it.I‘ve read it.It was eloquent, vibrating with eloquence, but too high-strung, I think.Seventeen pages of close writing he had found time for！But this must have been before his-let us say-nerves, went wrong, and caused him to preside at certain midnight dances ending with unspeakable rites, which-as far as I reluctantly gathered from what I heard at various times-were offered up to him-do you understand?—to Mr.Kurtz himself.But it was a beautiful piece of writing.The opening paragraph, however, in the light of later information, strikes me now as ominous.He began with the argument that we whites, from the point of development we had arrived at，’must necessarily appear to them[savages]in the nature of supernatural beings-we approach them with the might as of a deity，‘and so on, and so on.’By the simple exercise of our will we can exert a power for good practically unbounded，‘etc.，etc.From that point he soared and took me with him.The peroration was magnificent, though difficult to remember, you know.It gave me the notion of an exotic Immensity ruled by an august Benevolence.It made me tingle with enthusiasm.This was the unbounded power of eloquence-of words-of burning noble words.There were no practical hints to interrupt the magic current of phrases, unless a kind of note at the foot ofthe last page, scrawled evidently much later, in an unsteady hand, may be regarded as the exposition of a method.It was very simple, and at the end of that moving appeal to every altruistic sentiment it blazed at you, luminous and terrifying, like a flash of lightning in a serene sky：’Exterminate all the brutes！‘The curious part was that he had apparently forgotten all about that valuable postscriptum, because, later on, when he in a sense came to himself, he repeatedly entreated me to take good care of’my pamphlet‘（he called it），as it was sure to have in the future a good influence upon his career.I had full information about all these things, and, besides, as it turned out, I was to have the care of his memory.I’ve done enough for it to give me the indisputable right to lay it, if I choose, for an everlasting rest in the dust-bin of progress, amongst all the sweepings and, fguratively speaking, all the dead cats of civilisation.But then, you see, I can‘t choose.He won’t be forgotten.Whatever he was, he was not common.He had the power to charm or frighten rudimentary souls into an aggravated witch-dance in his honour；he could also fll the small souls of the pilgrims with bitter misgivings：he had one devoted friend at least, and he had conquered one soul in the world that was neither rudimentary nor tainted with self-seeking.No；I can‘t forget him, though I am not prepared to affrm the fellow was exactly worth the life we lost in getting to him.I missed my late helmsman awfully-I missed him even while his body was still lying in the pilot-house.Perhaps you will think it passing strange this regret for a savage who was no more account than a grain of sand in a black Sahara.Well, don’t you see, he had done something, he had steered；for months I had him at my back-a help-an instrument.It was a kind of partnership.He steered for me-I had to look after him, I worried about his defciencies, and thus a subtle bond had been created, of which I only became aware when it was suddenly broken.And the intimate profundity of that look he gave mewhen he received his hurt remains to this day in my memory-like a claim of distant kinship affrmed in a supreme moment.

Poor fool！If he had only left that shutter alone. He had no restraint, no restraint-just like Kurtz-a tree swayed by the wind.As soon as I had put on a dry pair of slippers, I dragged him out, after frst jerking the spear out of his side, which operation I confess I performed with my eyes shut tight.His heels leaped together over the little door-step；his shoulders were pressed to my breast；I hugged him from behind desperately.Oh！he was heavy, heavy；heavier than any man on earth, I should imagine.Then without more ado I tipped him overboard.The current snatched him as though he had been a wisp of grass, and I saw the body roll over twice before I lost sight of it for ever.All the pilgrims and the manager were then congregated on the awning-deck about the pilot-house, chattering at each other like a fock of excited magpies, and there was a scandalised murmur at my heartless promptitude.What they wanted to keep that body hanging about for I cant guess.Embalm it, maybe.But I had also heard another, and a very ominous, murmur on the deck below.My friends the wood-cutters were likewise scandalised, and with a better show of reason-though I admit that the reason itself was quite inadmissible.Oh, quite！I had made up my mind that if my late helmsman was to be eaten, the fshes alone should have him.He had been a very second-rate helmsman while alive, but now he was dead he might have become a frst-class temptation, and possibly cause some startling trouble.Besides, I was anxious to take the wheel, the man in pink pyjamas showing himself a hopeless duffer at the business.

This I did directly the simple funeral was over. We were going half-speed, keeping right in the middle of the stream, and I listened to the talk about me.They had given up Kurtz, they had given up the station；Kurtz was dead, and the station had been burnt-and so on-and so on.The red-haired pilgrim was beside himself with the thought that at least this poor Kurtz had been properly revenged.‘Say！We must have made a glorious slaughter of them in the bush.Eh?What do you think?Say?’He positively danced, the bloodthirsty little gingery beggar.And he had nearly fainted when he saw the wounded man！I could not help saying，‘You made a glorious lot of smoke, anyhow.’I had seen, from the way the tops of the bushes rustled and few, that almost all the shots had gone too high.You cant hit anything unless you take aim and fire from the shoulder；but these chaps fired from the hip with their eyes shut.The retreat, I maintained-and I was right-was caused by the screeching of the steam-whistle.Upon this they forgot Kurtz, and began to howl at me with indignant protests.

The manager stood by the wheel murmuring confidentially about the necessity of getting well away down the river before dark at all events, when I saw in the distance a clearing on the river-side and the outlines of some sort of building.‘What’s this?‘I asked. He clapped his hands in wonder.’The station！he cried.I edged in at once, still going half-speed.

Through my glasses I saw the slope of a hill interspersed with rare trees and perfectly free from undergrowth. A long decaying building on the summit was half buried in the high grass；the large holes in the peaked roof gaped black from afar；the jungle and the woods made a background.There was no enclosure or fence of any kind；but there had been one apparently, for near the house half-a-dozen slim posts remained in a row, roughly trimmed, and with their upper ends ornamented with round carved balls.The rails, or whatever there had been between, had disappeared.Of course the forest surrounded all that.The river-bank was clear, and on the water-side I saw a white man under a hat like a cart-wheel beckoning persistently with his whole arm.Examining the edge of the forest above and below, I was almost certain I could see movements-human formsgliding here and there.I steamed past prudently, then stopped the engines and let her drift down.The man on the shore began to shout, urging us to land.‘We have been attacked，’screamed the manager.‘I know-I know.It’s all right，‘yelled back the other, as cheerful as you please.’Come along.It‘s all right.I am glad.’

His aspect reminded me of something I had seen-something funny I had seen somewhere. As I manoeuvred to get alongside, I was asking myself，‘What does this fellow look like?’Suddenly I got it.He looked like a harlequin.His clothes had been made of some stuff that was brown holland probably, but it was covered with patches all over, with bright patches, blue, red, and yellow-patches on the back, patches on front, patches on elbows, on knees；coloured binding round his jacket, scarlet edging at the bottom of his trousers；and the sunshine made him look extremely gay and wonderfully neat withal, because you could see how beautifully all this patching had been done.A beardless, boyish face, very fair, no features to speak of, nose peeling, little blue eyes, smiles and frowns chasing each other over that open countenance like sunshine and shadow on a wind-swept plain.‘Look out, captain！’he cried；‘there’s a snag lodged in here last night.‘What！Another snag?I confess I swore shamefully.I had nearly holed my cripple, to finish off that charming trip.The harlequin on the bank turned his little pug nose up to me.’You English?‘he asked, all smiles.’Are you?‘I shouted from the wheel.The smiles vanished, and he shook his head as if sorry for my disappointment.Then he brightened up.’Never mind！‘he cried encouragingly.’Are we in time?‘I asked.’He is up there，he replied, with a toss of the head up the hill, and becoming gloomy all of a sudden.His face was like the autumn sky, overcast one moment and bright the next.

When the manager, escorted by the pilgrims, all of them armed to the teeth, had gone to the house, this chap came on board.‘I say, I don’t likethis. These natives are in the bush，‘I said.He assured me earnestly it was all right.’They are simple people，‘he added；’well, I am glad you came.It took me all my time to keep them off.‘’But you said it was all right，‘I cried.’Oh, they meant no harm，‘he said；and as I stared he corrected himself，’Not exactly.‘Then vivaciously，’My faith, your pilot-house wants a clean up！‘In the next breath he advised me to keep enough steam on the boiler to blow the whistle in case of any trouble.’One good screech will do more for you than all your rifes.They are simple people，‘he repeated.He rattled away at such a rate he quite overwhelmed me.He seemed to be trying to make up for lots of silence, and actually hinted, laughing, that such was the case.’Don‘t you talk with Mr.Kurtz?’I said.‘You don’t talk with that man-you listen to him，‘he exclaimed with severe exaltation.’But now—‘He waved his arm, and in the twinkling of an eye was in the uttermost depths of despondency.In a moment he came up again with a jump, possessed himself of both my hands, shook them continuously, while he gabbled：’Brother sailor……honour……pleasure……delight……introduce myself……Russian……son of an arch-priest……Government of Tambov……What?Tobacco！English tobacco；the excellent English tobacco！Now, that‘s brotherly.Smoke?Where’s a sailor that does not smoke?

The pipe soothed him, and gradually I made out he had run away from school, had gone to sea in a Russian ship；ran away again；served some time in English ships；was now reconciled with the arch-priest. He made a point of that.‘But when one is young one must see things, gather experience, ideas；enlarge the mind.’‘Here！’I interrupted.‘You can never tell！Here I have met Mr.Kurtz，’he said, youthfully solemn and reproachful.I held my tongue after that.It appears he had persuaded a Dutch trading-house on the coast to ft him out with stores and goods, and had started for the interior with a light heart, and no more idea of what would happen to him than a baby.He had been wandering about thatriver for nearly two years alone, cut off from everybody and everything.‘I am not so young as I look.I am twenty-five，’he said.‘At first old Van Shuyten would tell me to go to the devil，’he narrated with keen enjoyment；‘but I stuck to him, and talked and talked, till at last he got afraid I would talk the hind-leg off his favorite dog, so he gave me some cheap things and a few guns, and told me he hoped he would never see my face again.Good old Dutchman, Van Shuyten.I’ve sent him one small lot of ivory a year ago, so that he can‘t call me a little thief when I get back.I hope he got it.And for the rest I don’t care.I had some wood stacked for you.That was my old house.Did you see?

“I gave him Towson‘s book. He made as though he would kiss me, but restrained himself.’The only book I had left, and I thought I had lost it，‘he said, looking at it ecstatically.’So many accidents happen to a man going about alone, you know.Canoes get upset sometimes-and sometimes you‘ve got to clear out so quick when the people get angry.’He thumbed the pages.‘You made notes in Russian?’I asked.He nodded.‘I thought they were written in cipher，’I said.He laughed, then became serious.‘I had lots of trouble to keep these people off，’he said.‘Did they want to kill you?’I asked.‘Oh no！’he cried, and checked himself.‘Why did they attack us?’I pursued.He hesitated, then said shamefacedly，‘They don’t want him to go.‘’Don‘t they?’I said, curiously.He nodded a nod full of mystery and wisdom.‘I tell you，’he cried，‘this man has enlarged my mind.’He opened his arms wide, staring at me with his little blue eyes that were perfectly round.”





Chapter Three


I looked at him, lost in astonishment. There he was before me, in motley, as though he had absconded from a troupe of mimes, enthusiastic, fabulous.His very existence was improbable, inexplicable, and altogether bewildering.He was an insoluble problem.It was inconceivable how he had existed, how he had succeeded in getting so far, how he had managed to remain-why he did not instantly disappear.‘I went a little further，’he said，‘then still a little further-till I had gone so far that I don’t know how I‘ll ever get back.Never mind.Plenty time.I can manage.You take Kurtz away quick-quick-I tell you.’The glamour of youth enveloped his particoloured rags, his destitution, his loneliness, the essential desolation of his futile wanderings.For months-for years-his life hadn‘t been worth a day’s purchase；and there he was gallantly, thoughtlessly alive, to all appearance indestructible solely by the virtue of his few years and of his unrefecting audacity.I was seduced into something like admiration-like envy.Glamour urged him on, glamour kept him unscathed.He surely wanted nothing from the wilderness but space to breathe in and to push on through.His need was to exist, and to move onwards at the greatest possible risk, and with a maximum of privation.If the absolutely pure, uncalculating, impractical spirit of adventure had ever ruled a human being, it ruled this be-patched youth.I almost envied him the possession of this modest and clear fame.It seemed to have consumed all thought ofself so completely, that, even while he was talking to you, you forgot that it was he-the man before your eyes-who had gone through these things.I did not envy him his devotion to Kurtz, though.He had not meditated over it.It came to him, and he accepted it with a sort of eager fatalism.I must say that to me it appeared about the most dangerous thing in every way he had come upon so far.

They had come together unavoidably, like two ships becalmed near each other, and lay rubbing sides at last. I suppose Kurtz wanted an audience, because on a certain occasion, when encamped in the forest, they had talked all night, or more probably Kurtz had talked.‘We talked of everything，’he said, quite transported at the recollection.‘I forgot there was such a thing as sleep.The night did not seem to last an hour.Everything！Everything！……Of love too.’‘Ah, he talked to you of love！’I said, much amused.‘It isn’t what you think，‘he cried, almost passionately.’It was in general.He made me see things-things.

He threw his arms up. We were on deck at the time, and the headman of my wood-cutters, lounging near by, turned upon him his heavy and glittering eyes.I looked around, and I don‘t know why, but I assure you that never, never before, did this land, this river, this jungle, the very arch of this blazing sky, appear to me so hopeless and so dark, so impenetrable to human thought, so pitiless to human weakness.’And, ever since, you have been with him, of course?I said.

On the contrary. It appears their intercourse had been very much broken by various causes.He had, as he informed me proudly, managed to nurse Kurtz through two illnesses（he alluded to it as you would to some risky feat），but as a rule Kurtz wandered alone, far in the depths of the forest.‘Very often coming to this station, I had to wait days and days before he would turn up，’he said.‘Ah, it was worth waiting for！—sometimes.’‘What was he doing?exploring or what?’I asked.‘Oh yes, ofcourse；’he had discovered lots of villages, a lake too-he did not know exactly in what direction；it was dangerous to inquire too much-but mostly his expeditions had been for ivory.‘But he had no goods to trade with by that time，’I objected.‘There’s a good lot of cartridges left even yet，‘he answered, looking away.’To speak plainly, he raided the country，‘I said.He nodded.’Not alone, surely！‘He muttered something about the villages round that lake.’Kurtz got the tribe to follow him, did he?‘I suggested.He fdgeted a little.’They adored him，‘he said.The tone of these words was so extraordinary that I looked at him searchingly.It was curious to see his mingled eagerness and reluctance to speak of Kurtz.The man flled his life, occupied his thoughts, swayed his emotions.’What can you expect?‘he burst out；’he came to them with thunder and lightning, you know-and they had never seen anything like it-and very terrible.He could be very terrible.You can‘t judge Mr.Kurtz as you would an ordinary man.No, no, no！Now-just to give you an idea-I don’t mind telling you, he wanted to shoot me too one day-but I don‘t judge him.’‘Shoot you！’I cried.‘What for?’‘Well, I had a small lot of ivory the chief of that village near my house gave me.You see I used to shoot game for them.Well, he wanted it, and wouldn’t hear reason.He declared he would shoot me unless I gave him the ivory and then cleared out of the country, because he could do so, and had a fancy for it, and there was nothing on earth to prevent him killing whom he jolly well pleased.And it was true too.I gave him the ivory.What did I care！But I didn‘t clear out.No, no.I couldn’t leave him.I had to be careful, of course, till we got friendly again for a time.He had his second illness then.Afterwards I had to keep out of the way；but I didn‘t mind.He was living for the most part in those villages on the lake.When he came down to the river, sometimes he would talk to me, and sometimes it was better for me to be careful.This man suffered too much.He hated all this, and somehow he couldn’t getaway.When I had a chance I begged him to try and leave while there was time；I offered to go back with him.And he would say yes, and then he would remain；go off on another ivory hunt；disappear for weeks；forget himself amongst these people-forget himself-you know.‘’Why！he‘s mad，’I said.He protested indignantly.Mr.Kurtz couldn‘t be mad.If I had heard him talk, only two days ago, I wouldn’t dare hint at such a thing……I had taken up my binoculars while we talked, and was looking at the shore, sweeping the limit of the forest at each side and at the back of the house.The consciousness of there being people in that bush, so silent, so quiet-as silent and quiet as the ruined house on the hill-made me uneasy.There was no sign on the face of nature of this amazing tale that was not so much told as suggested to me in desolate exclamations, completed by shrugs, in interrupted phrases, in hints ending in deep sighs.The woods were unmoved, like a mask-heavy, like the closed door of a prison-they looked with their air of hidden knowledge, of patient expectation, of unapproachable silence.The Russian was explaining to me that it was only lately that Mr.Kurtz had come down to the river, bringing along with him all the fghting men of that lake tribe.He had been absent for several months-getting himself adored, I suppose-and had come down unexpectedly, with the intention to all appearance of making a raid either across the river or down stream.Evidently the appetite for more ivory had got the better of the-what shall I say?—less material aspirations.However he had got much worse suddenly.‘I heard he was lying here helpless, and so I came up-took my chance，’said the Russian.‘Oh, he is bad, very bad.’I directed my glass to the house.There were no signs of life, but there was the ruined roof, the long mud wall peeping above the grass, with three little square window-holes, no two of the same size；all this brought within reach of my hand, as it were.And then I made a brusque movement, and one of the remaining posts of that vanishedfence leaped up in the feld of my glass.You remember I told you I had been struck at the distance by certain attempts at ornamentation, rather remarkable in the ruinous aspect of the place.Now I had suddenly a nearer view, and its frst result was to make me throw my head back as if before a blow.Then I went carefully from post to post with my glass, and I saw my mistake.These round knobs were not ornamental but symbolic；they were expressive and puzzling, striking and disturbing-food for thought and also for the vultures if there had been any looking down from the sky；but at all events for such ants as were industrious enough to ascend the pole.They would have been even more impressive, those heads on the stakes, if their faces had not been turned to the house.Only one, the frst I had made out, was facing my way.I was not so shocked as you may think.The start back I had given was really nothing but a movement of surprise.I had expected to see a knob of wood there, you know.I returned deliberately to the frst I had seen-and there it was, black, dried, sunken, with closed eyelids-a head that seemed to sleep at the top of that pole, and, with the shrunken dry lips showing a narrow white line of the teeth, was smiling too, smiling continuously at some endless and jocose dream of that eternal slumber.

I am not disclosing any trade secrets. In fact the manager said afterwards that Mr.Kurtz‘s methods had ruined the district.I have no opinion on that point, but I want you clearly to understand that there was nothing exactly proftable in these heads being there.They only showed that Mr.Kurtz lacked restraint in the gratifcation of his various lusts, that there was something wanting in him-some small matter which, when the pressing need arose, could not be found under his magnifcent eloquence.Whether he knew of this deficiency himself I can’t say.I think the knowledge came to him at last-only at the very last.But the wilderness had found him out early, and had taken on him a terrible vengeance forthe fantastic invasion.I think it had whispered to him things about himself which he did not know, things of which he had no conception till he took counsel with this great solitude-and the whisper had proved irresistibly fascinating.It echoed loudly within him because he was hollow at the core……I put down the glass, and the head that had appeared near enough to be spoken to seemed at once to have leaped away from me into inaccessible distance.

The admirer of Mr. Kurtz was a bit crestfallen.In a hurried, indistinct voice he began to assure me he had not dared to take these-say, symbols-down.He was not afraid of the natives；they would not stir till Mr.Kurtz gave the word.His ascendency was extraordinary.The camps of these people surrounded the place, and the chiefs came every day to see him.They would crawl……‘I don’t want to know anything of the ceremonies used when approaching Mr.Kurtz，‘I shouted.Curious, this feeling that came over me that such details would be more intolerable than those heads drying on the stakes under Mr.Kurtz’s windows.After all, that was only a savage sight, while I seemed at one bound to have been transported into some lightless region of subtle horrors, where pure, uncomplicated savagery was a positive relief, being something that had a right to exist-obviously-in the sunshine.The young man looked at me with surprise.I suppose it did not occur to him Mr.Kurtz was no idol of mine.He forgot I hadn‘t heard any of these splendid monologues on, what was it?on love, justice, conduct of life-or what not.If it had come to crawling before Mr.Kurtz, he crawled as much as the veriest savage of them all.I had no idea of the conditions, he said：these heads were the heads of rebels.I shocked him excessively by laughing.Rebels！What would be the next defnition I was to hear?There had been enemies, criminals, workers-and these were rebels.Those rebellious heads looked very subdued to me on their sticks.’You don‘t know how such a life tries a man like Kurtz，’cried Kurtz‘s lastdisciple.’Well, and you?‘I said.’I！I！I am a simple man.I have no great thoughts.I want nothing from anybody.How can you compare me to……?‘His feelings were too much for speech, and suddenly he broke down.’I don‘t understand，’he groaned.‘I’ve been doing my best to keep him alive, and that‘s enough.I had no hand in all this.I have no abilities.There hasn’t been a drop of medicine or a mouthful of invalid food for months here.He was shamefully abandoned.A man like this, with such ideas.Shamefully！Shamefully！I-I—haven‘t slept for the last ten nights……’

His voice lost itself in the calm of the evening. The long shadows of the forest had slipped down hill while we talked, had gone far beyond the ruined hovel, beyond the symbolic row of stakes.All this was in the gloom, while we down there were yet in the sunshine, and the stretch of the river abreast of the clearing glittered in a still and dazzling splendour, with a murky and overshadowed bend above and below.Not a living soul was seen on the shore.The bushes did not rustle.

Suddenly round the corner of the house a group of men appeared, as though they had come up from the ground. They waded waist-deep in the grass, in a compact body, bearing an improvised stretcher in their midst.Instantly, in the emptiness of the landscape, a cry arose whose shrillness pierced the still air like a sharp arrow fying straight to the very heart of the land；and, as if by enchantment, streams of human beings-of naked human beings-with spears in their hands, with bows, with shields, with wild glances and savage movements, were poured into the clearing by the dark-faced and pensive forest.The bushes shook, the grass swayed for a time, and then everything stood still in attentive immobility.

‘Now, if he does not say the right thing to them we are all done for，’said the Russian at my elbow. The knot of men with the stretcher had stopped too, half-way to the steamer, as if petrifed.I saw the man on the stretcher sit up, lank and with an uplifted arm, above the shoulders of thebearers.‘Let us hope that the man who can talk so well of love in general will fnd some particular reason to spare us this time，’I said.I resented bitterly the absurd danger of our situation, as if to be at the mercy of that atrocious phantom had been a dishonouring necessity.I could not hear a sound, but through my glasses I saw the thin arm extended commandingly, the lower jaw moving, the eyes of that apparition shining darkly far in its bony head that nodded with grotesque jerks.Kurtz-Kurtz-that means‘short’in German-dont it?Well, the name was as true as everything else in his life-and death.He looked at least seven feet long.His covering had fallen off, and his body emerged from it pitiful and appalling as from a winding-sheet.I could see the cage of his ribs all astir, the bones of his arm waving.It was as though an animated image of death carved out of old ivory had been shaking its hand with menaces at a motionless crowd of men made of dark and glittering bronze.I saw him open his mouth wide-it gave him a weirdly voracious aspect, as though he had wanted to swallow all the air, all the earth, all the men before him.A deep voice reached me faintly.He must have been shouting.He fell back suddenly.The stretcher shook as the bearers staggered forward again, and almost at the same time I noticed that the crowd of savages was vanishing without any perceptible movement of retreat, as if the forest that had ejected these beings so suddenly had drawn them in again as the breath is drawn in a long aspiration.

Some of the pilgrims behind the stretcher carried his arms-two shot-guns, a heavy rife, and a light revolver-carbine-the thunderbolts of that pitiful Jupiter. The manager bent over him murmuring as he walked beside his head.They laid him down in one of the little cabins-just a room for a bed-place and a camp-stool or two, you know.We had brought his belated correspondence, and a lot of torn envelopes and open letters littered his bed.His hand roamed feebly amongst these papers.I wasstruck by the fre of his eyes and the composed languor of his expression.It was not so much the exhaustion of disease.He did not seem in pain.This shadow looked satiated and calm, as though for the moment it had had its fll of all the emotions.

He rustled one of the letters, and looking straight in my face said，‘I am glad.’Somebody had been writing to him about me. These special recommendations were turning up again.The volume of tone he emitted without effort, almost without the trouble of moving his lips, amazed me.A voice！a voice！It was grave, profound, vibrating, while the man did not seem capable of a whisper.However, he had enough strength in him-factitious no doubt-to very nearly make an end of us, as you shall hear directly.

The manager appeared silently in the doorway；I stepped out at once and he drew the curtain after me. The Russian, eyed curiously by the pilgrims, was staring at the shore.I followed the direction of his glance.

Dark human shapes could be made out in the distance, flitting indistinctly against the gloomy border of the forest, and near the river two bronze fgures, leaning on tall spears, stood in the sunlight under fantastic head-dresses of spotted skins, warlike and still in statuesque repose. And from right to left along the lighted shore moved a wild and gorgeous apparition of a woman.

She walked with measured steps, draped in striped and fringed cloths, treading the earth proudly, with a slight jingle and flash of barbarous ornaments. She carried her head high；her hair was done in the shape of a helmet；she had brass leggings to the knee, brass wire gauntlets to the elbow, a crimson spot on her tawny cheek, innumerable necklaces of glass beads on her neck；bizarre things, charms, gifts of witch-men, that hung about her, glittered and trembled at every step.She must have had the value of several elephant tusks upon her.She was savage and superb, wild-eyed and magnifcent；there was something ominous and stately in her deliberate progress.And in the hush that had fallen suddenly upon the whole sorrowful land, the immense wilderness, the colossal body of the fecund and mysterious life seemed to look at her, pensive, as though it had been looking at the image of its own tenebrous and passionate soul.

She came abreast of the steamer, stood still, and faced us. Her long shadow fell to the waters edge.Her face had a tragic and ferce aspect of wild sorrow and of dumb pain mingled with the fear of some struggling, half-shaped resolve.She stood looking at us without a stir and like the wilderness itself, with an air of brooding over an inscrutable purpose.A whole minute passed, and then she made a step forward.There was a low jingle, a glint of yellow metal, a sway of fringed draperies, and she stopped as if her heart had failed her.The young fellow by my side growled.The pilgrims murmured at my back.She looked at us all as if her life had depended upon the unswerving steadiness of her glance.Suddenly she opened her bared arms and threw them up rigid above her head, as though in an uncontrollable desire to touch the sky, and at the same time the swift shadows darted out on the earth, swept around on the river, gathering the steamer into a shadowy embrace.A formidable silence hung over the scene.

She turned away slowly, walked on, following the bank, and passed into the bushes to the left. Once only her eyes gleamed back at us in the dusk of the thickets before she disappeared.

‘If she had offered to come aboard I really think I would have tried to shoot her，’said the man of patches, nervously.‘I had been risking my life every day for the last fortnight to keep her out of the house. She got in though one day and kicked up a row about those miserable rags I picked up in the storeroom to mend my clothes with.I wasn’t decent.At least it must have been that, for she talked like a fury to Kurtz for an hour, pointing at me now and then.I don‘t understand the dialect of this tribe.Luckily for me, I fancy Kurtz felt too ill that day to care, or there would have been mischief.I don’t understand……No-it‘s too much for me.Ah, well, it’s all over now.

At this moment I heard Kurtz‘s deep voice behind the curtain，’Save me！—save the ivory, you mean. Don‘t tell me.Save me！Why, I’ve had to save you.You are interrupting my plans now.Sick！Sick！Not so sick as you would like to believe.Never mind.I‘ll carry my ideas out yet-I will return.I’ll show you what can be done.You with your little peddling notions-you are interfering with me.I will return.I……

“The manager came out. He did me the honour to take me under the arm and lead me aside.‘He is very low, very low，’he said.He considered it necessary to sigh, but neglected to be consistently sorrowful.‘We have done all we could for him-haven’t we?But there is no disguising the fact, Mr.Kurtz has done more harm than good to the Company.He did not see the time was not ripe for vigorous action.Cautiously, cautiously-that‘s my principle.We must be cautious yet.The district is closed to us for a time.Deplorable！Upon the whole, the trade will suffer.I don’t deny there is a remarkable quantity of ivory-mostly fossil.We must save it, at all events-but look how precarious the position is-and why?Because the method is unsound.‘’Do you，‘said I, looking at the shore，’call it”unsound method?‘’Without doubt，‘he exclaimed, hotly.’Don‘t you?’……‘No method at all，’I murmured after a while.‘Exactly，’he exulted.‘I anticipated this.Shows a complete want of judgment.It is my duty to point it out in the proper quarters.’‘Oh，’said I，‘that fellow-what’s his name?—the brickmaker, will make a readable report for you.‘He appeared confounded for a moment.It seemed to me I had never breathed an atmosphere so vile, and I turned mentally to Kurtz for relief-positively for relief.’Nevertheless I think Mr.Kurtz is a remarkable man，‘I said with emphasis.He started, dropped on me a cold heavy glance, said very quietly，’He was，and turned his back on me.My hour of favor was over.I found myself lumped along with Kurtz as a partisan of methods for which the time was not ripe.I was unsound！Ah！but it was something to have at least a choice of nightmares.

I had turned to the wilderness really, not to Mr. Kurtz, who, I was ready to admit, was as good as buried.And for a moment it seemed to me as if I also were buried in a vast grave full of unspeakable secrets.I felt an intolerable weight oppressing my breast, the smell of the damp earth, the unseen presence of victorious corruption, the darkness of an impenetrable night……The Russian tapped me on the shoulder.I heard him mumbling and stammering something about‘brother seaman-couldn’t conceal-knowledge of matters that would affect Mr.Kurtz‘s reputation.’I waited.For him evidently Mr.Kurtz was not in his grave.I suspect that for him Mr.Kurtz was one of the immortals.‘Well！’said I at last，‘speak out.As it happens, I am Mr.Kurtz’s friend-in a way.

He stated with a good deal of formality that had we not been‘of the same profession，’he would have kept the matter to himself without regard to consequences.‘He suspected there was an active ill-will towards him on the part of these white men that—’You are right，‘I said, remembering a certain conversation I had overheard.’The manager thinks you ought to be hanged.‘He showed a concern at this intelligence which amused me at frst.’I had better get out of the way quietly，‘he said, earnestly.’I can do no more for Kurtz now, and they would soon fnd some excuse. What‘s to stop them?There’s a military post three hundred miles from here.‘’Well, upon my word，‘said I，’perhaps you had better go if you have any friends amongst the savages near by.‘’Plenty，‘he said.’They are simple people-and I want nothing, you know.‘He stood biting his lip, then：’I don‘t want any harm to happen to these whites here, but of course I wasthinking of Mr.Kurtz’s reputation-but you are a brother seaman and—‘’All right，‘said I, after a time.’Mr.Kurtz‘s reputation is safe with me.’I did not know how truly I spoke.

He informed me, lowering his voice, that it was Kurtz who had ordered the attack to be made on the steamer.‘He hated sometimes the idea of being taken away-and then again……But I don’t understand these matters. I am a simple man.He thought it would scare you away-that you would give it up, thinking him dead.I could not stop him.Oh, I had an awful time of it this last month.‘’Very well，‘I said.’He is all right now.‘’Ye-e-es，‘he muttered, not very convinced apparently.’Thanks，‘said I；’I shall keep my eyes open.‘’But quiet-eh?‘he urged, anxiously.’It would be awful for his reputation if anybody here—‘I promised a complete discretion with great gravity.’I have a canoe and three black fellows waiting not very far.I am off.Could you give me a few Martini-Henry cartridges?‘I could, and did, with proper secrecy.He helped himself, with a wink at me, to a handful of my tobacco.’Between sailors-you know-good English tobacco.‘At the door of the pilot-house he turned round—’I say, haven‘t you a pair of shoes you could spare?’He raised one leg.‘Look.’The soles were tied with knotted strings sandal-wise under his bare feet.I rooted out an old pair, at which he looked with admiration before tucking it under his left arm.One of his pockets（bright red）was bulging with cartridges, from the other（dark blue）peeped‘Towson’s Inquiry，‘etc.，etc.He seemed to think himself excellently well equipped for a renewed encounter with the wilderness.’Ah！I‘ll never, never meet such a man again.You ought to have heard him recite poetry-his own too it was, he told me.Poetry！’He rolled his eyes at the recollection of these delights.‘Oh, he enlarged my mind！’‘Goodbye，’said I.He shook hands and vanished in the night.Sometimes I ask myself whether I had ever really seen him-whether it was possible to meet sucha phenomenon！……

When I woke up shortly after midnight his warning came to my mind with its hint of danger that seemed, in the starred darkness, real enough to make me get up for the purpose of having a look round. On the hill a big fre burned, illuminating ftfully a crooked corner of the station-house.One of the agents with a picket of a few of our blacks, armed for the purpose, was keeping guard over the ivory；but deep within the forest, red gleams that wavered, that seemed to sink and rise from the ground amongst confused columnar shapes of intense blackness, showed the exact position of the camp where Mr.Kurtzs adorers were keeping their uneasy vigil.The monotonous beating of a big drum flled the air with muffed shocks and a lingering vibration.A steady droning sound of many men chanting each to himself some weird incantation came out from the black, fat wall of the woods as the humming of bees comes out of a hive, and had a strange narcotic effect upon my half-awake senses.I believe I dozed off leaning over the rail, till an abrupt burst of yells, an overwhelming outbreak of a pent-up and mysterious frenzy, woke me up in a bewildered wonder.It was cut short all at once, and the low droning went on with an effect of audible and soothing silence.I glanced casually into the little cabin.A light was burning within, but Mr.Kurtz was not there.

I think I would have raised an outcry if I had believed my eyes. But I didnt believe them at frst-the thing seemed so impossible.The fact is I was completely unnerved by a sheer blank fright, pure abstract terror, unconnected with any distinct shape of physical danger.What made this emotion so overpowering was-how shall I defne it?—the moral shock I received, as if something altogether monstrous, intolerable to thought and odious to the soul, had been thrust upon me unexpectedly.This lasted of course the merest fraction of a second, and then the usual sense of commonplace, deadly danger, the possibility of a sudden onslaughtand massacre, or something of the kind, which I saw impending, was positively welcome and composing.It pacifed me, in fact, so much, that I did not raise an alarm.

There was an agent buttoned up inside an ulster and sleeping on a chair on deck within three feet of me. The yells had not awakened him；he snored very slightly；I left him to his slumbers and leaped ashore.I did not betray Mr.Kurtz-it was ordered I should never betray him-it was written I should be loyal to the nightmare of my choice.I was anxious to deal with this Shadow by myself alone-and to this day I dont know why I was so jealous of sharing with any one the peculiar blackness of that experience.

As soon as I got on the bank I saw a trail-a broad trail through the grass. I remember the exultation with which I said to myself，‘He can’t walk-he is crawling on all-fours-I‘ve got him.’The grass was wet with dew.I strode rapidly with clenched fsts.I fancy I had some vague notion of falling upon him and giving him a drubbing.I dont know.I had some imbecile thoughts.The knitting old woman with the cat obtruded herself upon my memory as a most improper person to be sitting at the other end of such an affair.I saw a row of pilgrims squirting lead in the air out of Winchesters held to the hip.I thought I would never get back to the steamer, and imagined myself living alone and unarmed in the woods to an advanced age.Such silly things-you know.And I remember I confounded the beat of the drum with the beating of my heart, and was pleased at its calm regularity.

I kept to the track though-then stopped to listen. The night was very clear：a dark blue space, sparkling with dew and starlight, in which black things stood very still.I thought I could see a kind of motion ahead of me.I was strangely cocksure of everything that night.I actually left the track and ran in a wide semicircle（I verily believe chuckling to myself）so as to get in front of that stir, of that motion I had seen-if indeed I had seen anything.I was circumventing Kurtz as though it had been a boyish game.

I came upon him, and, if he had not heard me coming, I would have fallen over him too, but he got up in time. He rose, unsteady, long, pale, indistinct, like a vapour exhaled by the earth, and swayed slightly, misty and silent before me；while at my back the fres loomed between the trees, and the murmur of many voices issued from the forest.I had cut him off cleverly；but when actually confronting him I seemed to come to my senses, I saw the danger in its right proportion.It was by no means over yet.Suppose he began to shout?Though he could hardly stand, there was still plenty of vigour in his voice.‘Go away-hide yourself，’he said, in that profound tone.It was very awful.I glanced back.We were within thirty yards from the nearest fire.A black figure stood up, strode on long black legs, waving long black arms, across the glow.It had horns-antelope horns, I think-on its head.Some sorcerer, some witch-man, no doubt：it looked fend-like enough.‘Do you know what you are doing?’I whispered.‘Perfectly，’he answered, raising his voice for that single word：it sounded to me far off and yet loud, like a hail through a speaking-trumpet.If he makes a row we are lost, I thought to myself.This clearly was not a case for fsticuffs, even apart from the very natural aversion I had to beat that Shadow-this wandering and tormented thing.‘You will be lost，’I said—‘utterly lost.’One gets sometimes such a fash of inspiration, you know.I did say the right thing, though indeed he could not have been more irretrievably lost than he was at this very moment, when the foundations of our intimacy were being laid-to endure-to endure-even to the end-even beyond.

‘I had immense plans，’he muttered irresolutely.‘Yes，’said I；‘but if you try to shout I’ll smash your head with—‘There was not a stick ora stone near.’I will throttle you for good，‘I corrected myself.’I was on the threshold of great things，‘he pleaded, in a voice of longing, with a wistfulness of tone that made my blood run cold.’And now for this stupid scoundrel—‘’Your success in Europe is assured in any case，‘I affrmed, steadily. I did not want to have the throttling of him, you understand-and indeed it would have been very little use for any practical purpose.I tried to break the spell-the heavy, mute spell of the wilderness-that seemed to draw him to its pitiless breast by the awakening of forgotten and brutal instincts, by the memory of gratifed and monstrous passions.This alone, I was convinced, had driven him out to the edge of the forest, to the bush, towards the gleam of fres, the throb of drums, the drone of weird incantations；this alone had beguiled his unlawful soul beyond the bounds of permitted aspirations.And, don’t you see, the terror of the position was not in being knocked on the head-though I had a very lively sense of that danger too-but in this, that I had to deal with a being to whom I could not appeal in the name of anything high or low.I had, even like the niggers, to invoke him-himself-his own exalted and incredible degradation.There was nothing either above or below him, and I knew it.He had kicked himself loose of the earth.Confound the man！he had kicked the very earth to pieces.He was alone, and I before him did not know whether I stood on the ground or foated in the air.I‘ve been telling you what we said-repeating the phrases we pronounced-but what’s the good?They were common everyday words-the familiar, vague sounds exchanged on every waking day of life.But what of that?They had behind them, to my mind, the terrifc suggestiveness of words heard in dreams, of phrases spoken in nightmares.Soul！If anybody had ever struggled with a soul, I am the man.And I wasn‘t arguing with a lunatic either.Believe me or not, his intelligence was perfectly clear-concentrated, it is true, upon himself with horrible intensity, yet clear；and therein was my onlychance-barring, of course, the killing him there and then, which wasn’t so good, on account of unavoidable noise.But his soul was mad.Being alone in the wilderness, it had looked within itself, and, by heavens！I tell you, it had gone mad.I had-for my sins, I suppose-to go through the ordeal of looking into it myself.No eloquence could have been so withering to ones belief in mankind as his final burst of sincerity.He struggled with himself, too.I saw it-I heard it.I saw the inconceivable mystery of a soul that knew no restraint, no faith, and no fear, yet struggling blindly with itself.I kept my head pretty well；but when I had him at last stretched on the couch, I wiped my forehead, while my legs shook under me as though I had carried half a ton on my back down that hill.And yet I had only supported him, his bony arm clasped round my neck-and he was not much heavier than a child.

When next day we left at noon, the crowd, of whose presence behind the curtain of trees I had been acutely conscious all the time, fowed out of the woods again, flled the clearing, covered the slope with a mass of naked, breathing, quivering bronze bodies. I steamed up a bit, then swung down-stream, and two thousand eyes followed the evolutions of the splashing, thumping, fery river-demon beating the water with its terrible tail and breathing black smoke into the air.In front of the first rank, along the river, three men, plastered with bright red earth from head to foot, strutted to and fro restlessly.When we came abreast again, they faced the river, stamped their feet, nodded their horned heads, swayed their scarlet bodies；they shook towards the ferce river-demon a bunch of black feathers, a mangy skin with a pendent tail-something that looked like a dried gourd；they shouted periodically together strings of amazing words that resembled no sounds of human language；and the deep murmurs of the crowd, interrupted suddenly, were like the responses of some satanic litany.

We had carried Kurtz into the pilot-house：there was more air there. Lying on the couch, he stared through the open shutter.There was an eddy in the mass of human bodies, and the woman with helmeted head and tawny cheeks rushed out to the very brink of the stream.She put out her hands, shouted something, and all that wild mob took up the shout in a roaring chorus of articulated, rapid, breathless utterance.

‘Do you understand this?’I asked.

He kept on looking out past me with fiery, longing eyes, with a mingled expression of wistfulness and hate. He made no answer, but I saw a smile, a smile of indefnable meaning, appear on his colourless lips that a moment after twitched convulsively.‘Do I not?’he said slowly, gasping, as if the words had been torn out of him by a supernatural power.

I pulled the string of the whistle, and I did this because I saw the pilgrims on deck getting out their rifes with an air of anticipating a jolly lark. At the sudden screech there was a movement of abject terror through that wedged mass of bodies.‘Don’t！don‘t you frighten them away，’cried someone on deck disconsolately.I pulled the string time after time.They broke and ran, they leaped, they crouched, they swerved, they dodged the fying terror of the sound.The three red chaps had fallen fat, face down on the shore, as though they had been shot dead.Only the barbarous and superb woman did not so much as finch, and stretched tragically her bare arms after us over the sombre and glittering river.

And then that imbecile crowd down on the deck started their little fun, and I could see nothing more for smoke.

The brown current ran swiftly out of the heart of darkness, bearing us down towards the sea with twice the speed of our upward progress；and Kurtz‘s life was running swiftly too, ebbing, ebbing out of his heart into the sea of inexorable time. The manager was very placid, he had no vital anxieties now, he took us both in with a comprehensive and satisfedglance：the’affair‘had come off as well as could be wished.I saw the time approaching when I would be left alone of the party of’unsound method.The pilgrims looked upon me with disfavor.I was, so to speak, numbered with the dead.It is strange how I accepted this unforeseen partnership, this choice of nightmares forced upon me in the tenebrous land invaded by these mean and greedy phantoms.

Kurtz discoursed. A voice！a voice！It rang deep to the very last.It survived his strength to hide in the magnifcent folds of eloquence the barren darkness of his heart.Oh, he struggled！he struggled！The wastes of his weary brain were haunted by shadowy images now-images of wealth and fame revolving obsequiously round his unextinguishable gift of noble and lofty expression.My Intended, my ivory, my station, my career, my ideas-these were the subjects for the occasional utterances of elevated sentiments.The shade of the original Kurtz frequented the bedside of the hollow sham, whose fate it was to be buried presently in the mould of primeval earth.But both the diabolic love and the unearthly hate of the mysteries it had penetrated fought for the possession of that soul satiated with primitive emotions, avid of lying fame, of sham distinction, of all the appearances of success and power.

Sometimes he was contemptibly childish. He desired to have kings meet him at railway-stations on his return from some ghastly Nowhere, where he intended to accomplish great things.‘You show them you have in hand something that is really proftable, and then there will be no limits to the recognition of your ability，’he would say.‘Of course you must take care of the motives-right motives-always.’The long reaches that were like one and the same reach, monotonous bends that were exactly alike, slipped past the steamer with their multitude of secular trees looking patiently after this grimy fragment of another world, the forerunner of change, of conquest, of trade, of massacres, of blessings.I looked ahead-piloting.‘Close the shutter，’said Kurtz suddenly one day；‘I can’t bear to look at this.‘I did so.There was a silence.’Oh, but I will wring your heart yet！he cried at the invisible wilderness.

We broke down-as I had expected-and had to lie up for repairs at the head of an island. This delay was the frst thing that shook Kurtz‘s confidence.One morning he gave me a packet of papers and a photograph-the lot tied together with a shoe-string.’Keep this for me，‘he said.’This noxious fool‘（meaning the manager）’is capable of prying into my boxes when I am not looking.‘In the afternoon I saw him.He was lying on his back with closed eyes, and I withdrew quietly, but I heard him mutter，’Live rightly, die, die……‘I listened.There was nothing more.Was he rehearsing some speech in his sleep, or was it a fragment of a phrase from some newspaper article?He had been writing for the papers and meant to do so again，’for the furthering of my ideas.It‘s a duty.’

His was an impenetrable darkness. I looked at him as you peer down at a man who is lying at the bottom of a precipice where the sun never shines.But I had not much time to give him, because I was helping the engine-driver to take to pieces the leaky cylinders, to straighten a bent connecting-rod, and in other such matters.I lived in an infernal mess of rust, filings, nuts, bolts, spanners, hammers, ratchet-drills-things I abominate, because I dont get on with them.I tended the little forge we fortunately had aboard；I toiled wearily in a wretched scrapheap-unless I had the shakes too bad to stand.

One evening coming in with a candle I was startled to hear him say a little tremulously，‘I am lying here in the dark waiting for death.’The light was within a foot of his eyes. I forced myself to murmur，‘Oh, nonsense！’and stood over him as if transfxed.

Anything approaching the change that came over his features I have never seen before, and hope never to see again. Oh, I wasnt touched.Iwas fascinated.It was as though a veil had been rent.I saw on that ivory face the expression of sombre pride, of ruthless power, of craven terror-of an intense and hopeless despair.Did he live his life again in every detail of desire, temptation, and surrender during that supreme moment of complete knowledge?He cried in a whisper at some image, at some vision-he cried out twice, a cry that was no more than a breath—

‘The horror！The horror！’

I blew the candle out and left the cabin. The pilgrims were dining in the mess-room, and I took my place opposite the manager, who lifted his eyes to give me a questioning glance, which I successfully ignored.He leaned back, serene, with that peculiar smile of his sealing the unexpressed depths of his meanness.A continuous shower of small fies streamed upon the lamp, upon the cloth, upon our hands and faces.Suddenly the managers boy put his insolent black head in the doorway, and said in a tone of scathing contempt—

‘Mistah Kurtz-he dead.’

All the pilgrims rushed out to see. I remained, and went on with my dinner.I believe I was considered brutally callous.However, I did not eat much.There was a lamp in there-light, dont you know-and outside it was so beastly, beastly dark.I went no more near the remarkable man who had pronounced a judgment upon the adventures of his soul on this earth.The voice was gone.What else had been there?But I am of course aware that next day the pilgrims buried something in a muddy hole.

And then they very nearly buried me.

However, as you see, I did not go to join Kurtz there and then. I did not.I remained to dream the nightmare out to the end, and to show my loyalty to Kurtz once more.Destiny.My destiny！Droll thing life is-that mysterious arrangement of merciless logic for a futile purpose.The most you can hope from it is some knowledge of yourself-thatcomes too late-a crop of unextinguishable regrets.I have wrestled with death.It is the most unexciting contest you can imagine.It takes place in an impalpable greyness, with nothing underfoot, with nothing around, without spectators, without clamour, without glory, without the great desire of victory, without the great fear of defeat, in a sickly atmosphere of tepid scepticism, without much belief in your own right, and still less in that of your adversary.If such is the form of ultimate wisdom, then life is a greater riddle than some of us think it to be.I was within a hair‘s-breadth of the last opportunity for pronouncement, and I found with humiliation that probably I would have nothing to say.This is the reason why I affrm that Kurtz was a remarkable man.He had something to say.He said it.Since I had peeped over the edge myself, I understand better the meaning of his stare, that could not see the fame of the candle, but was wide enough to embrace the whole universe, piercing enough to penetrate all the hearts that beat in the darkness.He had summed up-he had judged.’The horror！He was a remarkable man.After all, this was the expression of some sort of belief；it had candour, it had conviction, it had a vibrating note of revolt in its whisper, it had the appalling face of a glimpsed truth-the strange commingling of desire and hate.And it is not my own extremity I remember best-a vision of greyness without form filled with physical pain, and a careless contempt for the evanescence of all things-even of this pain itself.No！It is his extremity that I seem to have lived through.True, he had made that last stride, he had stepped over the edge, while I had been permitted to draw back my hesitating foot.And perhaps in this is the whole difference；perhaps all wisdom, and all truth, and all sincerity, are just compressed into that inappreciable moment of time in which we step over the threshold of the invisible.Perhaps！I like to think that my summing-up would not have been a word of careless contempt.Better his cry-much better.It was an affrmation, a moral victory paid for by innumerable defeats, by abominable terrors, by abominable satisfactions.But it was a victory！That is why I have remained loyal to Kurtz to the last, and even beyond, when a long time after I heard once more, not his own voice, but the echo of his magnifcent eloquence thrown to me from a soul as translucently pure as a cliff of crystal.

No, they did not bury me, though there is a period of time which I remember mistily, with a shuddering wonder, like a passage through some inconceivable world that had no hope in it and no desire. I found myself back in the sepulchral city resenting the sight of people hurrying through the streets to filch a little money from each other, to devour their infamous cookery, to gulp their unwholesome beer, to dream their insignifcant and silly dreams.They trespassed upon my thoughts.They were intruders whose knowledge of life was to me an irritating pretence, because I felt so sure they could not possibly know the things I knew.Their bearing, which was simply the bearing of commonplace individuals going about their business in the assurance of perfect safety, was offensive to me like the outrageous fauntings of folly in the face of a danger it is unable to comprehend.I had no particular desire to enlighten them, but I had some diffculty in restraining myself from laughing in their faces, so full of stupid importance.I dare say I was not very well at that time.I tottered about the streets-there were various affairs to settle-grinning bitterly at perfectly respectable persons.I admit my behaviour was inexcusable, but then my temperature was seldom normal in these days.My dear aunt‘s endeavours to’nurse up my strength‘seemed altogether beside the mark.It was not my strength that wanted nursing, it was my imagination that wanted soothing.I kept the bundle of papers given me by Kurtz, not knowing exactly what to do with it.His mother had died lately, watched over, as I was told, by his Intended.A clean-shaved man, with an official manner and wearing gold-rimmed spectacles, called on me one day and made inquiries, at first circuitous, afterwards suavely pressing, about what he was pleased to denominate certain’documents.‘I was not surprised, because I had had two rows with the manager on the subject out there.I had refused to give up the smallest scrap out of that package, and I took the same attitude with the spectacled man.He became darkly menacing at last, and with much heat argued that the Company had the right to every bit of information about its’territories.‘And, said he，’Mr.Kurtz‘s knowledge of unexplored regions must have been necessarily extensive and peculiar-owing to his great abilities and to the deplorable circumstances in which he had been placed：therefore—’I assured him Mr.Kurtz‘s knowledge, however extensive, did not bear upon the problems of commerce or administration.He invoked then the name of science.’It would be an incalculable loss if，‘etc.，etc.I offered him the report on the’Suppression of Savage Customs，‘with the postscriptum torn off.He took it up eagerly, but ended by sniffng at it with an air of contempt.’This is not what we had a right to expect，‘he remarked.’Expect nothing else，‘I said.’There are only private letters.‘He withdrew upon some threat of legal proceedings, and I saw him no more；but another fellow, calling himself Kurtz’s cousin, appeared two days later, and was anxious to hear all the details about his dear relative‘s last moments.Incidentally he gave me to understand that Kurtz had been essentially a great musician.’There was the making of an immense success，‘said the man, who was an organist, I believe, with lank grey hair flowing over a greasy coat-collar.I had no reason to doubt his statement；and to this day I am unable to say what was Kurtz’s profession, whether he ever had any-which was the greatest of his talents.I had taken him for a painter who wrote for the papers, or else for a journalist who could paint-but even the cousin（who took snuff during the interview）could not tell mewhat he had been-exactly.He was a universal genius-on that point I agreed with the old chap, who thereupon blew his nose noisily into a large cotton handkerchief and withdrew in senile agitation, bearing off some family letters and memoranda without importance.Ultimately a journalist anxious to know something of the fate of his‘dear colleague’turned up.This visitor informed me Kurtz‘s proper sphere ought to have been politics’on the popular side.‘He had furry straight eyebrows, bristly hair cropped short, an eye-glass on a broad black ribbon, and, becoming expansive, confessed his opinion that Kurtz really couldn’t write a bit—‘but heavens！how that man could talk！He electrified large meetings.He had faith-don’t you see?—he had the faith.He could get himself to believe anything-anything.He would have been a splendid leader of an extreme party.‘’What party?‘I asked.’Any party，‘answered the other.’He was an-an-extremist.‘Did I not think so?I assented.Did I know, he asked, with a sudden fash of curiosity，’what it was that had induced him to go out there?‘’Yes，‘said I, and forthwith handed him the famous Report for publication, if he thought ft.He glanced through it hurriedly, mumbling all the time, judged’it would do，and took himself off with this plunder.

Thus I was left at last with a slim packet of letters and the girl‘s portrait. She struck me as beautiful-I mean she had a beautiful expression.I know that the sunlight can be made to lie too, yet one felt that no manipulation of light and pose could have conveyed the delicate shade of truthfulness upon those features.She seemed ready to listen without mental reservation, without suspicion, without a thought for herself.I concluded I would go and give her back her portrait and those letters myself.Curiosity?Yes；and also some other feeling perhaps.All that had been Kurtz’s had passed out of my hands：his soul, his body, his station, his plans, his ivory, his career.There remained only his memoryand his Intended-and I wanted to give that up too to the past, in a way-to surrender personally all that remained of him with me to that oblivion which is the last word of our common fate.I don‘t defend myself.I had no clear perception of what it was I really wanted.Perhaps it was an impulse of unconscious loyalty, or the fulfllment of one of these ironic necessities that lurk in the facts of human existence.I don’t know.I cant tell.But I went.

I thought his memory was like the other memories of the dead that accumulate in every man‘s life-a vague impress on the brain of shadows that had fallen on it in their swift and fnal passage；but before the high and ponderous door, between the tall houses of a street as still and decorous as a well-kept alley in a cemetery, I had a vision of him on the stretcher, opening his mouth voraciously, as if to devour all the earth with all its mankind. He lived then before me；he lived as much as he had ever lived-a shadow insatiable of splendid appearances, of frightful realities；a shadow darker than the shadow of the night, and draped nobly in the folds of a gorgeous eloquence.The vision seemed to enter the house with me-the stretcher, the phantom-bearers, the wild crowd of obedient worshipers, the gloom of the forests, the glitter of the reach between the murky bends, the beat of the drum, regular and muffed like the beating of a heart-the heart of a conquering darkness.It was a moment of triumph for the wilderness, an invading and vengeful rush which, it seemed to me, I would have to keep back alone for the salvation of another soul.And the memory of what I had heard him say afar there, with the horned shapes stirring at my back, in the glow of fres, within the patient woods, those broken phrases came back to me, were heard again in their ominous and terrifying simplicity.I remembered his abject pleading, his abject threats, the colossal scale of his vile desires, the meanness, the torment, the tempestuous anguish of his soul.And later on I seemed to see hiscollected languid manner, when he said one day，’This lot of ivory now is really mine.The Company did not pay for it.I collected it myself at a very great personal risk.I am afraid they will try to claim it as theirs though.H‘m.It is a diffcult case.What do you think I ought to do-resist?Eh?I want no more than justice.’……He wanted no more than justice-no more than justice.I rang the bell before a mahogany door on the frst foor, and while I waited he seemed to stare at me out of the glassy panel-stare with that wide and immense stare embracing, condemning, loathing all the universe.I seemed to hear the whispered cry，‘The horror！The horror！’

The dusk was falling. I had to wait in a lofty drawing-room with three long windows from floor to ceiling that were like three luminous and bedraped columns.The bent gilt legs and backs of the furniture shone in indistinct curves.The tall marble freplace had a cold and monumental whiteness.A grand piano stood massively in a corner, with dark gleams on the fat surfaces like a sombre and polished sarcophagus.A high door opened-closed.I rose.

She came forward, all in black, with a pale head, foating towards me in the dusk. She was in mourning.It was more than a year since his death, more than a year since the news came；she seemed as though she would remember and mourn for ever.She took both my hands in hers and murmured，‘I had heard you were coming.’I noticed she was not very young-I mean not girlish.She had a mature capacity for fidelity, for belief, for suffering.The room seemed to have grown darker, as if all the sad light of the cloudy evening had taken refuge on her forehead.This fair hair, this pale visage, this pure brow, seemed surrounded by an ashy halo from which the dark eyes looked out at me.Their glance was guileless, profound, confdent, and trustful.She carried her sorrowful head as though she were proud of that sorrow, as though she would say, I-I alone know how to mourn for him as he deserves.‘But while we were stillshaking hands, such a look of awful desolation came upon her face that I perceived she was one of those creatures that are not the playthings of Time.For her he had died only yesterday.And, by Jove！the impression was so powerful that for me too he seemed to have died only yesterday-nay, this very minute.I saw her and him in the same instant of time-his death and her sorrow-I saw her sorrow in the very moment of his death.Do you understand?I saw them together-I heard them together.She had said, with a deep catch of the breath，’I have survived；‘while my strained ears seemed to hear distinctly, mingled with her tone of despairing regret, the summing-up whisper of his eternal condemnation.I asked myself what I was doing there, with a sensation of panic in my heart as though I had blundered into a place of cruel and absurd mysteries not ft for a human being to behold.She motioned me to a chair.We sat down.I laid the packet gently on the little table, and she put her hand over it……’You knew him well，she murmured, after a moment of mourning silence.

‘Intimacy grows quick out there，’I said.‘I knew him as well as it is possible for one man to know another.’

‘And you admired him，’she said.‘It was impossible to know him and not to admire him. Was it?’

‘He was a remarkable man，’I said, unsteadily. Then before the appealing fxity of her gaze, that seemed to watch for more words on my lips, I went on，‘It was impossible not to—’

‘Love him，’she finished eagerly, silencing me into an appalled dumbness.‘How true！how true！But when you think that no one knew him so well as I！I had all his noble confdence. I knew him best.’

‘You knew him best，’I repeated. And perhaps she did.But with every word spoken the room was growing darker, and only her forehead, smooth and white, remained illumined by the unextinguishable light of belief and love.

‘You were his friend，’she went on.‘His friend，’she repeated, a little louder.‘You must have been, if he had given you this, and sent you to me. I feel I can speak to you-and oh！I must speak.I want you-you who have heard his last words-to know I have been worthy of him……It is not pride……Yes！I am proud to know I understood him better than any one on earth-he told me so himself.And since his mother died I have had no one-no one-to-to—’

I listened. The darkness deepened.I was not even sure whether he had given me the right bundle.I rather suspect he wanted me to take care of another batch of his papers which, after his death, I saw the manager examining under the lamp.And the girl talked, easing her pain in the certitude of my sympathy；she talked as thirsty men drink.I had heard that her engagement with Kurtz had been disapproved by her people.He wasn‘t rich enough or something.And indeed I don’t know whether he had not been a pauper all his life.He had given me some reason to infer that it was his impatience of comparative poverty that drove him out there.

‘……Who was not his friend who had heard him speak once?’she was saying.‘He drew men towards him by what was best in them.’She looked at me with intensity.‘It is the gift of the great，’she went on, and the sound of her low voice seemed to have the accompaniment of all the other sounds, full of mystery, desolation, and sorrow, I had ever heard-the ripple of the river, the soughing of the trees swayed by the wind, the murmurs of wild crowds, the faint ring of incomprehensible words cried from afar, the whisper of a voice speaking from beyond the threshold of an eternal darkness.‘But you have heard him！You know！’she cried.

‘Yes, I know，’I said with something like despair in my heart, but bowing my head before the faith that was in her, before that great and saving illusion that shone with an unearthly glow in the darkness, in the triumphant darkness from which I could not have defended her-fromwhich I could not even defend myself.

‘What a loss to me-to us！’—she corrected herself with beautiful generosity；then added in a murmur，‘To the world.’By the last gleams of twilight I could see the glitter of her eyes, full of tears-of tears that would not fall.

‘I have been very happy-very fortunate-very proud，’she went on.‘Too fortunate. Too happy for a little while.And now I am unhappy for-for life.’

She stood up；her fair hair seemed to catch all the remaining light in a glimmer of gold. I rose too.

‘And of all this，’she went on, mournfully，‘of all his promise, and of all his greatness, of his generous mind, of his noble heart, nothing remains-nothing but a memory. You and I—’

‘We shall always remember him，’I said, hastily.

‘No！’she cried.‘It is impossible that all this should be lost-that such a life should be sacrificed to leave nothing-but sorrow. You know what vast plans he had.I knew of them too-I could not perhaps understand-but others knew of them.Something must remain.His words, at least, have not died.’

‘His words will remain，’I said.

‘And his example，’she whispered to herself.‘Men looked up to him-his goodness shone in every act. His example—’

‘True，’I said；‘his example too. Yes, his example.I forgot that.’

‘But I do not. I cannot-I cannot believe-not yet.I cannot believe that I shall never see him again, that nobody will see him again, never, never, never！’

She put out her arms as if after a retreating fgure, stretching them black and with clasped pale hands across the fading and narrow sheen of the window. Never see him！I saw him clearly enough then.I shall see thiseloquent phantom as long as I live, and I shall see her too, a tragic and familiar Shade, resembling in this gesture another one, tragic also, and bedecked with powerless charms, stretching bare brown arms over the glitter of the infernal stream, the stream of darkness.She said suddenly very low，‘He died as he lived.’

‘His end，’said I, with dull anger stirring in me，‘was in every way worthy of his life.’

‘And I was not with him，’she murmured. My anger subsided before a feeling of infnite pity.

‘Everything that could be done—’I mumbled.

‘Ah, but I believed in him more than anyone on earth-more than his own mother, more than-himself. He needed me！Me！I would have treasured every sigh, every word, every sign, every glance.’

I felt like a chill grip on my chest.‘Don’t，I said, in a muffed voice.

‘Forgive me. I-I—have mourned so long in silence-in silence……You were with him-to the last?I think of his loneliness.Nobody near to understand him as I would have understood.Perhaps no one to hear……’

‘To the very end，’I said, shakily.‘I heard his very last words……’I stopped in a fright.

‘Repeat them，’she said in a heart-broken tone.‘I want-I want-something-something-to-to live with.’

I was on the point of crying at her，‘Don’t you hear them?‘The dusk was repeating them in a persistent whisper all around us, in a whisper that seemed to swell menacingly like the frst whisper of a rising wind.’The horror！The horror！

‘His last word-to live with，’she murmured.‘Don’t you understand I loved him-I loved him-I loved him！

I pulled myself together and spoke slowly.

‘The last word he pronounced was-your name.’

“I heard a light sigh, and then my heart stood still, stopped dead short by an exulting and terrible cry, by the cry of inconceivable triumph and of unspeakable pain.‘I knew it-I was sure！’……She knew. She was sure.I heard her weeping；she had hidden her face in her hands.It seemed to me that the house would collapse before I could escape, that the heavens would fall upon my head.But nothing happened.The heavens do not fall for such a trife.Would they have fallen, I wonder, if I had rendered Kurtz that justice which was his due?Hadn‘t he said he wanted only justice?But I couldn’t.I could not tell her.It would have been too dark-too dark altogether……”

Marlow ceased, and sat apart, indistinct and silent, in the pose of a meditating Buddha. Nobody moved for a time.“We have lost the frst of the ebb，”said the Director, suddenly.I raised my head.The offing was barred by a black bank of clouds, and the tranquil waterway leading to the uttermost ends of the earth fowed sombre under an overcast sky-seemed to lead into the heart of an immense darkness.
