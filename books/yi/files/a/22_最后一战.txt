第一章　大锅湖畔


在纳尼亚最后的日子，远在灯柱荒野以西，即邻近大瀑布的地方，住着一只猿猴。他已上了年纪，谁也不清楚他是什么时候来这里居住的；他是你能想象得到的最聪明、最丑陋、皱纹最多的猿猴。这猿猴名叫雪夫特，他有一间木头房子，建在一棵大树的枝丫上，屋顶盖着树叶。在这一片树林里，难得有会说话的野兽，也难得有人类、小矮人这一类生灵；但雪夫特有个朋友和邻居，一头名叫帕塞尔的驴。至少他们自认为是朋友，但从实际的情况看，你倒觉得帕塞尔更像雪夫特的仆人，而不是朋友。所有的活都是帕塞尔干的。他们一起去河边取水时，雪夫特用大皮袋装水，但驮大皮袋回家的总是帕塞尔。当他们需要点什么东西去下游的集镇采购时，去时的空驮篮和回来时又满又沉的驮篮也总是放在帕塞尔的身上。采购到的最好的东西，都被雪夫特吃了，因为雪夫特会说：“帕塞尔，你知道的，我不能像你那样把草和蓟当饭吃，只好吃点别的东西补补身体。”帕塞尔总是说：“那当然，雪夫特，那当然。这道理我懂。”

帕塞尔从来不抱怨，因为他知道雪夫特比他聪明许多，他觉得雪夫特能把他当朋友看就很给面子了。每当帕塞尔想跟雪夫特争论点什么，雪夫特总是说：“帕塞尔，你听好了，我比你更懂得什么事是必须做的。你要清楚，帕塞尔，你是不太聪明的。”帕塞尔这时也总是说：“是的，雪夫特，这是事实，我是不够聪明。”说完，他只能长叹一声，继续按雪夫特的吩咐去做。

这年年初的一个上午，这对朋友正沿着大锅湖岸行走。大锅湖是纳尼亚西部边陲的一个大湖，位于悬崖峭壁之下。巨大的瀑布从悬崖倾泻而下，那隆隆的声音就像永不间断的雷鸣；纳尼亚河就从它的一侧流过。瀑布使湖水不停地翻腾、冒泡，一圈圈地旋转，就像在锅里沸腾，大锅湖这个名称就是这样得来的。纳尼亚河起源于西部荒原。早春时节，荒原山上的积雪融化开来，使瀑布的流水变得十分充沛，这时的大锅湖是最有生气的。他们望着大锅湖，雪夫特突然用他那又黑又瘦的手指着湖面说：

“看！那是什么？”

“你说什么呀？”帕塞尔说。

“那黄灿灿的东西，刚被瀑布冲下来。看！在那里，漂在水上了。我们得弄弄清楚那到底是什么东西。”

“有这必要吗？”帕塞尔说。

“当然有必要，”雪夫特说，“可能是一件有用的东西。你像游泳好手那样跳下湖去，把它捞上来。让我们好好看看它。”

“跳下湖去？”帕塞尔说，晃了晃他的长耳朵。

“是啊，你不跳下去，我们怎么能得到它啊？”猿猴说。

“但是——但是，”帕塞尔说，“你自己下去不更好吗？你知道，是你想知道那是什么东西，我是不想知道的。你自己有手，是不是？抓起东西来，你是跟人类或小矮人一样灵活的，不像我只有蹄子。”

“帕塞尔，”雪夫特说，“我万万没有想到你会说出这样的话。我真的万万没有想到。”

“怎么，我说错了什么吗？”驴子说话的声音很谦卑，因为他看出雪夫特十分生气了。“我的意思是——”

“你是想让我下水，”猿猴说。“好像你一点儿也不知道我们猿猴的肺是多么的脆弱，我们是多么容易着凉！好了。我下去就是。这一阵冷风一吹，我就感到很有点冷了。但我还是要下去。我也许会死在水里，那时你会难过的。”雪夫特带着哭腔说，好像就要流眼泪了。

“别这样，别这样，别这样，”帕塞尔的声音一半像谈话，一半像驴叫。“我没有那个意思，雪夫特，真的没有。你知道我是多么愚蠢，我总是一次不能思考两件事。我忘记了你脆弱的肺。当然应该我下水。你用不着亲自动手。答应我，雪夫特，你一定不要下水。”

雪夫特答应了。帕塞尔踏着四个蹄子咔嗒咔嗒地来到大锅湖的石头沿岸上，寻找可以下水的地方。湖水寒冷且不说，进入奔腾起伏、冒着泡沫的河水可不是闹着玩的。帕塞尔下决心下水以前，站在岸上颤抖了好一会儿，直到雪夫特在背后叫他：“也许还是我自己下水的好，帕塞尔。”帕塞尔听了后连忙说：“不，不，你答应过的。我现在就下去，”说完便跃入水中。

一个浪花打在他的脸上，使他嘴里灌满了水，眼睛一片模糊。他的身子下沉了好几秒钟，当他重新浮出水面时，已经被水冲到另一处。这时漩涡卷住了他，使他在水中旋转起来，并且越转越快，一直转到瀑布下方；瀑布的力量迫使他下沉，下沉，他觉得自己如果再不浮出水面，就很难屏住呼吸了。但他还是挣扎着上来，并靠近想要抓住的那件东西；但那东西这时又漂走了，卷进瀑布下方，被激流冲入水底。当那东西再次漂出水面时，他已经离帕塞尔更远了。

最后，当他累得死去活来，浑身伤痕累累，四肢麻木时，帕塞尔总算用牙齿咬住了那件东西。他爬上岸，把那东西放在面前，用前蹄卷起。这东西有炉膛前的地毯那么大，很沉，很凉，很滑。

帕塞尔把它抛到雪夫特跟前，站在那里，身子滴着水，咯咯颤抖着，竭力让自己缓过气来。猿猴没有看他，也不问问他的感觉；只是不停地在那件东西跟前转来转去，把它摊开，拍打它，用鼻子闻它。最后，雪夫特眼里闪过一道邪恶的光芒，说：“这是一张狮子皮。”

“嗯——噢——噢，是吗？”帕塞尔气喘吁吁地说。

“我在想……我在想……我在想……”雪夫特自言自语地说，陷入沉思。

“是谁杀害了这头可怜的狮子呢？”帕塞尔脱口而出。“这狮皮应该埋起来才好。我们应该为它举行一次葬礼。”

“它一定不是一只会说话的狮子，”雪夫特说。“你用不着操心。出了这个大瀑布，在整个西部荒野就再也没有会说话的野兽了。这块皮毛也许是属于一头哑巴野狮子的。”

顺便说一句，雪夫特这话倒真的说对了。几个月以前，有个猎人在西部荒野打死了一头狮子，剥了狮子的皮。但我们的故事不详细写这一情节。

“反正都一样，雪夫特，”帕塞尔说，“即便这张皮属于一头哑巴野狮子，我们就不该体面地埋葬它吗？我是说，所有的狮子都相当——相当威严，是不是？其中的道理你是知道的。你心里清楚，是不是？”

“帕塞尔，别让思想进入你的头脑了，”雪夫特说，“你知道，思考不是你的长项。我们可以用这张狮皮给你做一件漂亮暖和的冬衣呢。”

“我不喜欢这个主意，”驴子说，“那时我看上去会像——我是说别的野兽会以为——我是说，我不愿意觉得——”

“你在说什么呀？”雪夫特边说边像其他猿猴那样在自己身上乱抓一气。

“如果像我这样的一头驴穿起狮皮招摇过市，我觉得，这是对伟大的狮王阿斯兰本人的不恭敬，”帕塞尔说。

“请你不要再跟我争论了，”雪夫特说，“像你这样的一头驴怎么会思考起这样的问题来呢？帕塞尔，你知道你并不擅长思考，那你为什么不让我代替你思考呢？你为什么不像我对待你那样对待我？我并不觉得自己什么都行。我知道你在某些方面比我强。这也就是我让你下水的原因，我知道你能做得比我好。但说到我能做而你不能做的事，我为什么不能发挥一下我的长处呢？你不该让我也做点什么吗？要公平，依次轮流。”

“好吧，既然你这么说，那就这么办吧，”帕塞尔说。

“你听我说，”雪夫特说，“你最好沿着河一路小跑到奇宾福德一趟，看看那里有没有橘子和香蕉。”

“但我太累了，雪夫特，”帕塞尔说。

“是的，你是又冷又湿，”猿猴说，“你需要做点什么事热热身。小跑就是一个好办法。还有，今天正好是奇宾福德的集市。”这以后，不用说，帕塞尔愿意前往了。

帕塞尔一走，雪夫特就蹒跚地回到他的树上，有时他是直立着行走，有时则四只爪子爬行。他从这一根树枝荡到那一根树枝，嘴里不停地吱吱叫着，牙齿暴露着，就这样回到了他的小屋子。他找来针线和一把大剪子；由于他心灵手巧，小矮人教过他如何缝制衣服。他将一个线团含在嘴里（这个线团有点粗陋，说它是线，不如说是绳子更好），鼓起腮帮，就像嘴里含了颗太妃糖。他把针咬在嘴里，用左爪握住那把剪子。然后他从树上下来，蹒跚来到狮皮那里，蹲下身，做起了针线活。

他很快看出，整块狮皮一旦披到驴身上，躯干部分显得太长，脖子部分又太短。于是他从躯干部分剪下一大块，用它给帕塞尔的长脖子制作了一个长长的领子。然后他将这个领子缝在狮皮的脑袋和肩膀之间。他用线把狮皮的两边都缝了缝，使这件给帕塞尔穿的外套的胸腹部都得以收紧。时而有小鸟从雪夫特的头上飞过，这时他总要停下手中的活计，焦虑地抬头张望。他不想让别的动物知道他正在做的事。好在目睹他的作为的鸟儿都不会说人话，因此坏不了他的事。

傍晚时分，帕塞尔回来了。他不是小跑着回来的，而是耐心地一路踏着沉重的步子走回来的，像其他的驴那样。

“那里没有橘子，”他说，“也没有香蕉。我很累了。”说完，便躺了下来。

“过来，试试这件漂亮的狮皮袄，”雪夫特说。

“讨厌的老狮皮，”帕塞尔说，“明天早上再试吧。我现在累了。”

“你真不知好歹，帕塞尔，”雪夫特说，“你累了，你有没有想过我呢？这一整天，当你悠闲自在地走在山谷中时，我却一直忙着为你缝制衣服。我的手酸得连剪子都拿不起来了。你一句感谢的话都没有说——甚至没正眼看一看你的衣服——你太不在意——太不在意——”

“我亲爱的雪夫特，”帕塞尔赶紧站了起来，“实在对不起。我太粗暴了。我当然很愿意试穿一下。它太漂亮了。马上就试试。请吧。”

“好，你站好了，”猿猴说。狮皮很沉，猿猴提不动它，最后又是拉又是推，累得他气喘吁吁，总算把狮皮袄披到了驴子身上。他在驴肚子下将狮皮扣紧，还给驴腿套上狮腿皮，给驴尾巴配上狮尾巴。帕塞尔那灰不溜秋的鼻子和脸孔都隐藏在巨大的狮嘴里。凡见过真正的狮子的人，是绝不会上当的。但对于从没有见过狮子的人，当他看见这头披着狮皮的驴，如果他离他有些距离，或者光线不怎么好，或者帕塞尔不发出驴叫声，不用他的蹄子弄出任何声响，很可能会把驴误认作狮子。

“你看上去好极了，好极了，”猿猴说，“任何生灵现在看见你，都会当你是阿斯兰，伟大的狮王本尊。”

“那会很糟糕的，”帕塞尔说。

“不，绝对不糟糕，”雪夫特说，“那时你就可以号令天下了。”

“但我并不想号令天下。”

“想想我们能得到的好处吧！”猿猴说，“你知道，你有我给你出主意呢。我会想出一些聪明的法令让你去颁布。那时所有生灵都得服从我们，包括国王本人。我们可以把纳尼亚王国治理得好好的。”

“现在不是一切都很好吗？”帕塞尔说。

“什么话！”雪夫特叫了起来，“一切都很好——没有橘子，没有香蕉，能好到哪里去呢？”

“你知道，”帕塞尔说，“不会有多少生灵——事实上，除了你就不会有生灵——需要那一类东西。”

“还有糖呢，”雪夫特说。

“嗯，这倒也是，”驴子说，“如果有更多的糖，那倒是好事。”

“好了，就这样定了，”猿猴说，“你来假扮阿斯兰，我来告诉你说什么话。”

“不行，不行，不行，”帕塞尔说，“别说这样可怕的话了。这会犯错误的，雪夫特。我虽然不聪明，但其中的利害还是懂的。如果真的阿斯兰出现了，我们的后果会怎么样呢？”

“我想他会很高兴的，”雪夫特说，“也许这块狮皮就是他自己特意送来的，为的是让我们整顿好这里的一切。再说，他绝对不可能出现，这你是知道的。就目前而言，没有这个可能。”

这时，他们的头顶突然响起一声巨大的雷鸣，使得大地都微微颤抖起来。两只动物站立不住，都摔倒在地上了。

“天啊，”帕塞尔好久才缓过气来，结结巴巴地说，“这就是征兆，是警告。我知道，我们在做的事是非常邪恶的。快帮我脱下这件讨厌的皮袄吧。”

“别脱，别脱，”猿猴说（他的脑子转得很快），“这正是好兆头呢。我正想说，如果那位真正的阿斯兰（你是这样称呼的）想让我们做这件事，他会给我们送来雷鸣或地震这样的征兆的。我要说的话还没来得及出口，征兆就已经来了。帕塞尔，现在你不做也不行了。我们再也不要争论了吧。你知道，这些事情不是你能理解的。一头驴子，怎么能理解征兆呢？”





第二章　鲁莽的国王


大约三个星期以后，纳尼亚的最后一位国王坐在他的狩猎小屋旁的一棵大橡树底下：在气候宜人的春天，他都要到这里来住上十来天时间。这是一幢茅草盖顶的矮房子，坐落在灯柱荒野的东端，两条河流交汇处的上游。国王喜欢摆脱政务，离开繁华的凯尔帕拉维尔王宫，来这里过上一段时间简朴而自在的生活。他的名字叫提里安，年纪在二十到二十五岁之间；他肩膀很宽，很强壮，四肢的肌肉很结实，但胡子是稀稀的，眼睛是蓝蓝的，诚实的脸上透露出无所畏惧的神情。

那个春天的早晨，他没有带侍臣，陪伴他的只有他最亲密的朋友：一只叫作珠厄儿的独角兽。他们亲如兄弟，在战场上还相互救过对方的性命。这只高贵的野兽此时就站在国王的椅子旁，低着头，用蓝蓝的独角摩擦雪白的腹部。

“我今天什么事也不想做，也不想打猎，珠厄儿，”国王说，“我满脑子想的是这个美妙的消息。你觉得我们今天还能听到更多的消息吗？”

“如果传闻是真实的，陛下，”珠厄儿说，“在我们这个时代，甚至在我们的父亲或爷爷的时代，这消息无疑是最美妙的。”

“谁还能不相信它呢？”国王说，“一个星期以前，从我们头顶飞过的第一群鸟儿就说，阿斯兰在这里，阿斯兰又来纳尼亚了。这以后是松鼠，他们虽然没有亲眼看见，但都确信阿斯兰就在森林里。之后报信的是鹿，他说是他亲眼看见的，只是距离有点远，在月光底下，在灯柱荒野那边。再以后是那个长着胡子的黑皮肤的人，即那个来自卡乐门的商人。卡乐门人不像我们那样在意阿斯兰；但他说到阿斯兰时是不容你怀疑的。还有昨天晚上那只獾，他也亲眼看见了阿斯兰。”

“是的，陛下，”珠厄儿说，“我是完全相信的。如果我觉得不可信，那也是因为我心里太高兴，以致不敢相信这一切都是真的。这消息太美妙了，美妙得让人起了疑心。”

“是啊，”国王感叹着说，因为兴奋，身子差不多在颤抖，“这是我一生中最大的愿望了。”

“听！”珠厄儿一边叫道，一边侧转脑袋，竖起耳朵。

“什么声音？”国王问。

“是马蹄声，陛下，”珠厄儿说，“一匹奔腾的马，一匹极其魁梧的马。肯定是人头马。看，他来了。”

一匹高大的、胡子金黄的人头马朝国王飞奔而来，他的额头上流着人的汗水，栗色的马身上流着马的汗水。他在国王跟前停了下来，深深地鞠了一躬。“万福，国王陛下！”他的声音像公牛那样深沉。

“来人！”国王扭头朝狩猎小屋的门口呼喊，“给高贵的客人端一碗酒来。欢迎你，鲁威特。你先喘喘气，等气顺了再说你的来意。”

一位侍者从小屋里端出一个雕刻得十分新奇的大木碗，递给人头马。人头马将木碗高高举起，说：

“陛下，让我先为阿斯兰和真理干杯！然后再为国王您干杯！”

他把酒一饮而尽（那一大碗酒足够六个人喝），然后将空碗还给侍者。

“说吧，鲁威特，”国王说，“你是不是带来了有关阿斯兰的消息？”

鲁威特表情严肃，还皱了皱眉头。

“陛下，”他说，“你知道，长期以来我一直在研究星相学；我们人头马比你们人类长寿，我们的寿命甚至超过你们独角兽。但从今年年初到现在，每天晚上我都能从空中见到不祥之兆，这是我一生中从未见过的。星相没有显示阿斯兰到来，也没有显示和平与幸福。我凭我的法术知道，灾难性的行星会合的天象，已有五百年没有出现了。我早就想来提醒陛下：纳尼亚即将面临一场大灾难。昨天晚上又有谣言传到我耳里，说阿斯兰已经来到纳尼亚。陛下，不要相信这样的无稽之谈，这是不可能的。星相永远不会说谎，说谎的只有人和野兽。如果阿斯兰真的要来纳尼亚，天上会有预兆的。如果狮王真的要来，所有的吉祥星都会聚集在一起向他致敬。这次肯定是个谎言。”

“谎言！”国王显得有点激动，“在纳尼亚乃至整个世界，谁敢撒这样的弥天大谎？”不知不觉间，他已把自己的手按在剑柄上。

“这我也不知道了，国王陛下，”人头马说，“我只知道世上有说谎者；星星中是没有的。”

“我在怀疑，”珠厄儿说，“即便所有的星相都显示出相反的预兆，阿斯兰是不是就不来了呢？他不是星星的奴隶，而是他们的创造者。在所有的传说中，不是说他并不是一只温驯的狮子吗？”

“说得对，说得对，珠厄儿，”国王说，“就这句话，不是温驯的狮子，许多故事里都这么说。”

鲁威特举起手，正想靠近国王跟他说句什么话，一阵号啕大哭的声音突然响起，并且离他们越来越近。大家于是转过头去谛听。西边的树木太茂密，他们一时还看不到来人，但声音已经听见了。

“不幸啊，不幸啊，不幸啊！”那声音高叫着，“我的兄弟姐妹大祸临头了！神圣的树木大祸临头了！森林被毁了。斧子砍到我们身上来了。我们被砍了。大树一棵棵倒下了，倒下了，倒下了。”

当最后一声“倒下了”响起时，他们已经看见了说话的人。来者像一个女子，但十分高大，论个头不亚于人头马，同时还像一棵树。如果你从来没有见过树精，我在这里就很难向你解释了，但如果你见过，事情是一目了然的：无论肤色、声音、头发，树精跟人类女子都是不一样的。提里安国王和两只动物立刻认出，来者是山毛榉仙子。

“主持公道吧，国王陛下！”仙子大声呼叫，“快来救救我们，快来保护你的子民。他们正在灯柱荒野砍伐我们。我的四十个兄弟姐妹已经倒在地上了。”

“什么，夫人！砍伐灯柱荒野？屠杀会说话的树木？”国王忽地站了起来，拔剑在手，“他们怎么如此胆大包天？谁敢这样肆意妄为？我凭阿斯兰的鬃毛起誓——”

“啊——啊——啊，”树精喘着粗气，痛苦地颤抖着——她不停地颤抖着，好像正遭受着一次次的打击。突然间，她斜着身子倒了下去，好像她的双脚已经被砍断。不一会儿，他们看见她倒在草地上，死了，身影也随即消失。他们知道发生了什么事：几英里以外，属于她的那棵树被砍了。

国王悲愤交加，一时间竟不知道说什么好了。过了一会儿，他开口说：

“来吧，朋友们。我们应以最快的速度去上游看看，找到犯事的歹徒。不管是谁，一个也不能轻饶。”

“愿为陛下效劳，”珠厄儿说。

鲁威特说：“陛下，您在气头上，务必谨慎行事。各种怪事已经出现；上游山谷里如果有武装的叛徒，光凭我们三个是对付不了的。我以为陛下还是再等等吧——”

“我半秒钟也不想等了，”国王说，“我和珠厄儿先赶过去，你以最快的速度返回凯尔帕拉维尔王宫。这是我的戒指，你拿去作为凭证。马上给我调集二十个勇士，每人骑上一匹快马，然后再调集二十只会说话的狗，十个小矮人（个个必须是百发百中的好射手），一两只豹子，还有巨人斯顿福特。迅速将这支队伍带来这里增援我们。”

“遵命，陛下，”鲁威特说，随即转身，朝山谷的东边奔驰而去。

国王大踏步前行，时而喃喃自语，时而握紧拳头。珠厄儿默默地走在他身边；除了独角兽脖子上挂着的金链子发出的叮当声以及他们的脚步声和蹄声，四周一片寂静。

他们很快来到河边，并沿着河边一条长满绿草的小路往上走：左侧就是河流，右侧是森林。不久，他们眼前的地面越来越陡峭，茂密的树木一直延伸到河边。那条道路——如果算得上道路——已经向南岸延展，要想到达那里，就得渡过河去。河水淹及提里安的腋窝，珠厄儿（他因为有四条腿，在水中行走得更稳当）始终走在国王的右侧，为他阻挡河水的冲击；国王则用自己强壮的手臂抱住独角兽的脖子。他们就这样安全地过了河。国王仍在盛怒之中，没注意到河水的寒冷。上岸以后，国王小心翼翼地用外套的肩膀位置擦干他的宝剑，那也是他身上唯一一处没被水浸泡过的地方。

现在他们沿着右侧的河流向西行走，灯柱荒野就在他们前面不远。两人还没走上一英里，便同时停下脚步，同时开口说话。国王说：“这是什么东西？”珠厄儿则说：“看！”

“是木排，”提里安国王说。

确实是木排。六根刚被砍下的挺拔的树干，削去了枝丫，被扎在一起，做成了一个木排，正飞快地顺流而下。木排的前端站着一只水鼠，他正握着一根竹篙驾驭着木排。

“喂，水鼠！你在干什么？”国王大声喊话。

“把木头运下去，卖给卡乐门人，陛下，”水鼠一边说，一边还碰了碰耳朵，表示对国王的敬意，好像耳朵就是他的帽子。

“卡乐门人！”提里安厉声责问，“你这是什么意思？谁命令你们砍倒这些树的？”

一年中这个季节水流湍急，转眼间木排已经从国王和珠厄儿身边漂过去。水鼠转身回头，大声回应说：

“奉狮王的命令，陛下。阿斯兰本尊。”他还补充说了其他的话，但他们已经听不见了。

国王和独角兽面面相觑，很是惊慌，这样的表情是他们在出生入死的战场上都未曾有过的。

“阿斯兰，”国王终于轻声嘟哝起来，“阿斯兰。这会是真的吗？他会砍倒神圣的树木，屠杀树精吗？”

“可能是树精犯下了可怕的罪孽——”珠厄儿喃喃地说。

“把木头卖给卡乐门人！”国王说，“这怎么可能呢？”

“这我就不知道了，”珠厄儿伤心地说，“他不是一只温驯的狮子。”

“好吧，”国王说，“我们还是继续前进，把已经开始的历险进行下去吧。”

“我们也只好这样办了，陛下，”独角兽说。此时此刻，他根本没意识到他们两个单独行动是多么的愚蠢；国王也是。他们出于义愤已经有点头脑发昏。由于鲁莽，他们最终将付出惨重的代价。

国王突然把身子斜靠在他的朋友的脖子上，垂下头去。

“珠厄儿，”他说，“真不知后面会发生什么事！我感到十分恐惧。如果我们昨天就一死了之，那该多幸福啊。”

“是啊，”珠厄儿说，“我们活得太久了。世上最糟糕的事降临到我们身上了。”他们就那样呆呆地站了一两分钟，然后继续前行。

不久以后，他们来到一个山冈跟前，尽管那里什么也看不见，但已能听见斧子砍树的噼噼啪啪声。当他们登上山顶时，灯柱荒野已尽收眼底。看到眼前的景象，国王的脸都白了。

就在那座长有金树银树的古老的森林里——来自我们这个世界的一个孩子曾经在那里栽种过一棵“幸运树”——一条宽敞的通道已经开辟出来。这是一条令人厌恶的通道，就像大地开了一个丑陋的口子，砍伐下来的树木经由那里被拖向河边，通道上留下了深深的拖痕。一大班人在那里忙碌着，马鞭噼噼啪啪地响着，马儿拖曳着木头，全身的肌肉紧紧地绷着。国王和独角兽首先注意到，这些生灵有一半是不会说话的野兽，而是人。随后他们又注意到，这些人都不是金发碧眼的纳尼亚人，而是黑皮肤大胡子的卡乐门人。这卡乐门是个凶残的大国，位于大沙漠以南，与魔王之乡遥相呼应。

许多年以来，纳尼亚王国和卡乐门王国是和平共处的，因此，你在纳尼亚碰见一两个卡乐门人——商人或使者——也是自然不过的事。但这一次提里安就弄不懂了：为什么一下子冒出那么多卡乐门人；更让他纳闷的是，他们为什么要来砍伐纳尼亚的森林呢？国王紧紧地握住手中的剑，把外套卷起，搁在左臂上。国王和独角兽很快来到他们中间。

两个卡乐门人正鞭策着一匹拉着木头的马。国王来到他们身边时，木头陷入了一个糟糕的泥坑。

“走啊，懒小子！拉啊，你这头懒猪！”卡乐门人吆喝着，打着响鞭。那马儿已经竭尽全力；他的眼睛红红的，浑身冒着汗。

“出力啊，懒惰的畜生，”一个卡乐门人一边大声嚷嚷着，一边恶狠狠地鞭打马儿。随后便出现令人震惊的一幕。

到目前为止，提里安还一直以为卡乐门人驾驭的马是他们自己的马，即那些不会说话、缺乏智慧的牲口，就像我们这个世界的马一样。虽然他不愿看到哑巴马受虐待，但他想得更多的是他的树精被屠杀。他万万没有想到有人竟敢奴役会说话的纳尼亚马，更不要说用鞭子抽打他们。当野蛮的鞭子再次落下时，那马用后腿立起，尖叫着抗议：

“傻瓜和暴君！你没看见我已经竭尽全力了吗？”

提里安这才知道那马是他治下的纳尼亚马，他和独角兽都不由得怒不可遏，一时间也不知道自己在做什么了。国王的宝剑举了起来，独角兽的长角低了下去。他们同时朝前冲去。两个卡乐门人倒地死了：一个被国王的剑砍了头，另一个被珠厄儿的长角刺穿了心脏。





第三章　荣耀的猿猴


“马师傅，马师傅，”提里安一边赶紧为马儿割断缰绳，一边问，“这些外国人怎么奴役起你来了？纳尼亚被征服了吗？没听说过交战啊。”

“没有，陛下，”马儿气喘吁吁地说，“阿斯兰在这里。都是按照他的命令办的。他曾经下令——”

“这里有危险，陛下，”珠厄儿说。提里安抬起头，发现卡乐门人（其中还有会说话的野兽）正从四面八方向他们奔来。那两个卡乐门人一声不吭就死了，其余的人一时间还不知道发生了什么事。但他们很快明白过来，许多人拔出了明晃晃的弯刀。

“快！骑到我的背上！”珠厄儿对国王说。

国王飞身跳上老友的背脊；独角兽驮着他疾驰而去。他几次变换方向，直到敌人看不见他们；越过一条小溪后，独角兽仍未放慢脚步，只是口中大声喊着：“我们去哪里，陛下？去凯尔帕拉维尔吗？”

“快停下，朋友，”提里安说，“让我下来。”他从独角兽的背上下来，面对着他。

“珠厄儿，”国王说，“我们做了可怕的事了。”

“我们是被激怒的。”珠厄儿说。

“但我们突然攻击了他们——没有预先挑战——他们并无武装——呸！我们是两个凶手，珠厄儿。我从此名誉扫地了。”

珠厄儿低下了头，也感到十分的羞愧。

“还有，”国王说，“那马说他们奉的是阿斯兰的指令。老鼠也这样说。他们都说阿斯兰在这里。这消息会不会是真的？”

“陛下，阿斯兰怎么可能命令他们做这样可怕的事啊？”

“他不是一头温驯的狮子，”提里安说，“我们怎么知道什么样的事是他想做的呢？我们，珠厄儿，我们是凶手，我一定得回去。我要放下我的剑，把自己交给卡乐门人，请求他们带我去见阿斯兰，让他来审判我。”

“那你会因此送命的，”珠厄儿说。

“如果是阿斯兰判我死刑，你觉得我会在意吗？”国王说，“我决不在意，一点儿也不在意。与其担惊受怕，唯恐即将光临的阿斯兰与我们一直信仰、一直盼望的那一个不一样，还不是死了更好吗？这就像你盼望的太阳有一天升起来了，结果却是一个黑色的太阳一样。”

“这我懂，”珠厄儿说，“这就像你去喝水，结果水井已经干涸。你是对的，陛下，那时一切都结束了。我们去自首吧。”

“没有必要你我都去。”

“如果我们是相互敬爱的，就让我跟你一起去吧，”独角兽说，“如果你死了，如果阿斯兰不是真正的阿斯兰，生命对于我还有什么意义呢？”

他们于是转身往回走，眼里流着苦涩的泪水。

他们刚走到砍伐树木的地方，卡乐门人就呼啸起来，手提武器来到他们身边。国王向他们交出自己的剑，说：“我以前是纳尼亚国王，现在是不光彩的骑士，我自愿向阿斯兰投案，接受他的审判。带我去见他吧。”

“我也自愿投案，”珠厄儿说。

那班黑皮肤的人随即将国王和珠厄儿团团围住，他们的白眼珠子在褐色的脸蛋上可怕地闪烁着，空气中弥漫着大蒜和洋葱的气味。他们用一个笼头套住珠厄儿的脖子；拿走国王的宝剑，把他的双手反绑起来。其中一个卡乐门人头上没缠头巾，却戴了一个头盔，看样子是个头领，他从提里安头上抢走他的金箍，迅速塞进自己的衣服里。这以后他们便将两个囚犯带到山上的一片空地上。下面是两个囚犯所看见的：

在空地的中央，即这座小山的最高处，搭建着一间类似马厩的小茅屋。小屋子的门关着。门前的草地上坐着一只猿猴。一心只想见到阿斯兰的提里安和珠厄儿对于猿猴一无所知，初见之下不免十分困惑。这只猿猴不用说就是雪夫特，但此刻的他因为打扮过了，比起在大锅湖时还要丑陋十倍。他穿的是一件很不合身的猩红色外套，这件衣服本来是为小矮人设计的。他的后爪子上穿了双镶有珠宝的拖鞋，那也是不合脚的，因为你知道，猿猴的后爪跟人的手十分相似。他头上戴了一顶王冠，看样子是用纸糊成的。他的身边有一大堆坚果，此时他正用嘴咔吧咔吧地咬着，把果壳吐得满地都是。他还时不时地拉起那件红外套为自己搔痒。

一大群会说话的野兽面对着他站着，每张脸都显得心事重重，惶惑不安。当他们看见新来的囚犯时，大家都流着泪哀叹起来。

“阿斯兰的代言人雪夫特阁下，”卡乐门人的头领说，“我们给你带俘虏来了。凭我们的武功和勇气，凭塔什大神的恩准，我们活捉了这两个穷凶极恶的杀人犯。”

“把这个人的剑给我，”猿猴说。他们于是把国王的宝剑，连同剑鞘和其他的一切都交给了猴子。雪夫特把剑挂在自己的脖子上，这使它显得更愚蠢了。

“我们过一会儿再来处置这两个家伙，”猿猴一边说，一边朝两个囚犯吐了吐果壳，“我有其他的事需要优先处理。让他们等着。现在大家听好了，我首先要说说坚果的事。松鼠的首领有没有来？”

“有，阁下，”一只红松鼠走上前来，诚惶诚恐地鞠了一躬。

“啊，你是，是你呀？”猿猴说，表情令人作呕，“现在注意听我说。我需要——我是说阿斯兰需要——更多的坚果。你们送来的这些，是远远不够的。你们得再送一些来，听见了吗？这个数的两倍。明天太阳下山以前必须送到，不可以有坏的或小的。”

其他的松鼠都沮丧地低语起来，松鼠的首领壮了壮胆说：“请问阁下，阿斯兰自己会不会跟我们亲口说这件事？能否允许我们见见他？”

“你们不可以，”猿猴说：“阿斯兰是非常仁慈的——虽然你们中的大多数不配消受他的慈爱——今天晚上他会出来几分钟。那时你们可以看看他。但你们不可以在他身边挤来挤去，用各种问题骚扰他。你们想跟他说什么，必须通过我来转达，我知道什么事值得去打扰他。这时候你们全体松鼠得去找坚果。你们得确保明天晚上把坚果送到，不然的话，听着，你们将受惩罚的！”

可怜的松鼠都惊慌失措地散开了，好像有狗在追赶他们。这项新的命令对他们来说是可怕的。他们费尽心血贮藏起来过冬的坚果差不多都吃光了；剩下的坚果数量有限，进贡给猿猴的已远远超过他们的承受力了。

这时，从另一群动物中响起了一个沉闷的声音——说话者是一只长着獠牙、毛发蓬松的野猪：

“为什么我们不能好好看看阿斯兰，跟他说话呢？”他说，“从前他在纳尼亚时，谁都可以跟他面对面交谈。”

“别相信这样的传言，”猿猴说，“即便是真的，但时代也不同了。阿斯兰说，他以前对你们太温和了，这你知道吗？他再也不会那样温和了。这一次他要让你们懂一点儿规矩。他要教训教训你们，让你们记住他并不是一头温驯的狮子。”

动物中响起了一阵低沉的哀叹和哭泣。这以后，便是死一般的沉默，使气氛变得更凄凉了。

“现在还有一件事得让你们记住，”猿猴说，“我听说你们当中有人说我是一只猿猴。其实我不是，我是一个人。如果我看上去像一只猿猴，那是因为我太老了，我已经有几千岁了。正因为我年岁大，我才这样聪明。正因为我聪明，我才成为阿斯兰愿意交谈的唯一的人。他不愿跟一大班愚蠢的动物对话。你们应该做什么事，他都会先告诉我，然后让我向你们转达。听好我的忠告吧，雷厉风行地按我所说的去做，因为阿斯兰是容不得你们说废话的。”

又是死一般的沉默，动物群中只听见一只幼獾在哭叫，他的母亲竭力哄他，想让他安静下来。

“还有一件事，”猿猴一边继续说，一边将一颗新鲜的坚果塞进嘴里，“我听见有的马在说，‘让我们抓紧时间，赶快把运输木头的工作做完，然后我们就自由了。’这种想法你们应该赶紧从脑子里排除出去。不仅仅是那些马得这样做，能够干活的所有动物，将来都得去干活。阿斯兰已经跟卡乐门人的国王——我们那些黑皮肤的朋友都叫他提斯罗克——签署了协议。所有的马儿、公牛和驴子都要送到卡乐门国去做工谋生——像其他国家的牛儿马儿那样从事拉货驮货的工作。所有善于挖地的动物，包括鼹鼠、兔子和小矮人，都得到提斯罗克的矿山里去做工。还有——”

“不，不，”动物们都吼叫起来，“这不可能是真的。阿斯兰决不会把我们卖给卡乐门国王做奴隶。”

“别吵了！给我闭嘴！”猿猴咆哮着，“谁说做奴隶？你们不是奴隶。你们有报酬的——报酬还很高呢。那是说，你们的报酬将进入阿斯兰的国库，阿斯兰将用这笔钱为所有的动物谋福利。”说完，他瞟了一眼（几乎是眨眼）那个卡乐门人的首领。

卡乐门人以浮夸的卡乐门礼节深深地鞠了一躬，回答说：

“阿斯兰最贤明的代言人阁下，关于这项审慎的计划，我们的提斯罗克陛下（愿他万寿无疆）跟您的意见是完全一致的。”

“你们看！”猿猴说，“一切都安排妥当了。全都是为了你们好。有了你们挣来的钱，我们就能够把纳尼亚建成最值得居住的地方。橘子和香蕉将堆积如山——到处是马路、大都市、学校、办公大楼、皮鞭、口勒、鞍辔、笼子、狗窝、监狱——总之，什么都有。”

“这些东西我们一概不需要，”一只老熊说，“我们需要自由。我们要听听阿斯兰本人的声音。”

“别跟我争论了，”猿猴说，“这是我不能容忍的。我是一个人，你只是一头又胖又蠢的老熊。你懂什么叫自由！你以为自由就是做你喜欢做的事吗？你错了。那不是真正的自由。真正的自由就是按我的吩咐去做。”

“呃——呃——”老熊嘟哝着，搔了搔头皮。他觉得这样的理论很难理解。

“对不起，对不起，”动物群中响起一只小绵羊尖厉的声音，所有的动物都很惊讶：他年纪那么小，居然也敢站出来说话。

“对不起，”小羊羔说，“我有一个疑问，我们为什么要跟卡乐门人打交道呢？我们属于阿斯兰，他们属于塔什。他们说塔什有四只手，秃鹫的头。他们在他的祭坛上杀人。我不相信真有塔什。就算有吧，阿斯兰怎么会跟他成为朋友呢？”

所有的动物都斜抬起脑袋，所有的眼睛都盯着猿猴看。他们觉得小羊羔提出了一个最好的问题。

猿猴跳了起来，朝小羊羔吐了一口痰。

“小东西！”他厉声训斥说，“愚蠢的小羊崽子！回家吃你老娘的奶去吧。这种事情你懂个屁！你们，其他的，给我听着，塔什是阿斯兰的另一个称呼。有人总觉得我们是对的，卡乐门人是错的，这种旧观念是愚蠢的。现在我们更明事理了。尽管卡乐门人使用了不同的词语，但指的是同一件事。塔什也好，阿斯兰也罢，只是两个不同的称呼，所指的是谁，大家心里都清楚。为什么他们之间没有发生争吵，道理就在这里。愚蠢的野兽们，给我把这个观念塞进脑子里去。塔什就是阿斯兰，阿斯兰就是塔什。”

你知道你家里的狗悲伤时会有什么样的神情。想象一下吧，然后再想象一下那些会说话的动物的脸部表情：所有这些诚实的、谦恭的、不知所措的鸟儿、熊、獾、兔子、鼹鼠和松鼠，都比你家的狗悲伤得多。所有的尾巴都耷拉着，每一根胡须都萎靡不振。如果你有同情心，看见了这一张张脸时你会心碎的。这里只有一只动物看上去不那么伤心。

那是一只大黄猫——一只体形硕大、正值盛年的公猫——他将尾巴卷在脚趾上，直挺挺地坐在前排。他的眼睛一直紧紧地盯着猿猴和卡乐门人的头领，眼珠子眨都没眨一下。

“对不起，”大黄猫彬彬有礼地说，“这个问题我感兴趣。你的卡乐门朋友也这样看吗？”

“那当然，”卡乐门人说，“心明眼亮的猿——噢，我是说人——说得很对。阿斯兰既不弱于也不强于塔什。”

“尤其不强于塔什吧？”大黄猫提示他。

“绝对不强于他，”卡乐门人直视着大黄猫说。

“这个回答你满意了吧，大黄猫？”猿猴说。

“满意了，”大黄猫冷冷地说，“非常感谢你。我只是想弄弄清楚。我觉得我开始有点懂了。”

在此以前，国王和珠厄儿一直没有说话，他们一直在等待猿猴的发落，因为他们知道插嘴是没有用的。提里安四下看着他的纳尼亚子民悲伤的脸，当他注意到他们都相信阿斯兰和塔什是一体时，再也忍耐不住了。

“猿猴！”他厉声说，“你说谎。你这是要遭天谴的。你像卡乐门人那样说谎。你是一只惯于说谎的猴子。”

他还想说下去，他想责问猿猴：喝人血的凶神塔什怎么可以跟用自己的血拯救纳尼亚的善良的狮王相提并论？如果允许他说下去，猿猴的暴政当天就可能结束；所有的野兽会明白过来，从而将猿猴推翻。但下面的话他一句也来不及说，两个卡乐门人已经狠狠地打了他的嘴巴，第三个卡乐门人还从背后踢他的脚。他倒了下去，只听见暴跳如雷的猿猴在尖叫：

“把他押下去！把他押下去！把他带到听不见我们说话，我们也听不见他说话的地方。把他绑到一棵树上去。过会儿我要——我是说阿斯兰——要审判他。”





第四章　晚上发生的事


国王被他们打晕了，几乎不知道究竟发生了什么事，直到卡乐门人解开他手上的绳子，让他的手下垂在身体的两侧，背脊靠到一棵梣树上。然后他们就把他的脚踝、膝盖、腰部、胸部团团捆住，捆好后就丢他在那里不管了。此时最让他难受的是刚才被打的嘴角在流血，那里很痒，但他又无法把流下的血擦去——微不足道的小事常让人苦不堪言。

从他所在的地方，他依然能看见山顶上那座小马厩，以及坐在马厩前的猿猴。他还能听见猿猴继续说话的声音，时不时地还能听见来自动物群中的应答，但他们具体说了什么，他就不得而知了。

“不知道他们如何处置珠厄儿，”国王心里想。

过了一会儿，那群动物解散了，各自走自己的路。有几只动物就从他身边走过。他们朝他看了看，既惊恐又难过，但谁也没有说话。很快他们全走远了，树林里变得很安静。一小时一小时过去，提里安开始感到口渴，然后是饥饿。随着下午渐逝，天色转晚，他感到有点冷了。他的背开始发痛。太阳下山了，夜幕渐次降临。

当天色完全暗下来时，提里安听见一阵窸窸窣窣的脚步声，并看见几只小动物向他靠近。左边三只是田鼠，中间一只是兔子，右边两只是鼹鼠。他们的背上都驮着小袋子，这使他们在黑暗中的模样显得很怪异，一开始还使他认不出他们是什么动物。不一会儿，他们都用后腿站立起来，把冰凉的爪子搁在他的膝盖上，对着他的膝盖献上动物特有的碰鼻吻（他们够得到他的膝盖，因为纳尼亚这一类会说话的小动物比起英格兰的哑巴同类来显然高大一些）。

“国王陛下，亲爱的国王陛下，”他们吱吱地叫着，“我们为你感到难过。但我们不敢给你松绑，只怕阿斯兰会对我们生气。我们给你捎晚饭来了。”

第一只老鼠敏捷地爬了上来，脚踩在绑住提里安胸脯的绳子上，在他的脸前抽动起笨拙的鼻子。然后第二只老鼠爬了上来，挂在第一只老鼠的下方。其他的动物站在地上，开始传递食物。

“喝吧，陛下，先喝点这个，你就有胃口吃东西了，”站在最上面的老鼠说。提里安发现递到他嘴边的是一只小小的木杯。杯子只有鸡蛋壳般大小，他还尝不出酒的味道，杯子已经空了。老鼠将空杯传下去，其他的动物将它重新斟满，再传递上来；提里安再次一饮而尽。他们就这样传递着杯子，直到国王喝了个痛快。小杯饮用其实比大杯牛饮更解渴，更有益于身体。

“这是干酪，陛下，”第一只老鼠说，“数量不多，只怕这东西吃多了会口渴。”吃完干酪后他们又喂他吃燕麦饼和鲜黄油，然后又让他喝了些酒。

“现在把水递上来，”第一只老鼠说，“我要给国王洗洗脸。他的脸上都是血。”

提里安觉得好像有一小块海绵一样的东西擦拭着他的脸，这是十分提神的。

“小朋友们，”提里安国王说，“我得怎样谢谢你们啊？”

“你不用谢，不用谢，”几个尖细的声音都说，“除此之外我们还能为你做点什么呢？我们不想要其他的国王。我们是你的子民。如果只有猿猴和卡乐门人跟你作对，在他们把你捆绑起来以前，我们一定不惜粉身碎骨，跟他们战斗到底。我们一定，一定会这样做。但我们不能反抗阿斯兰。”

“你们觉得阿斯兰真的来了吗？”国王问。

“噢，是的，是的，”兔子说，“昨天晚上他从马厩里走出来，我们都看见了。”

“他是什么模样？”国王说。

“确实像一只可怕的大狮子，”一只老鼠说。

“你们觉得真的是阿斯兰杀害了林间仙女，是他让你们成为卡乐门国王的奴隶吗？”

“哎，这事确实糟糕，不是吗？”第二只老鼠说，“如果这一切发生之前我们就死了，那倒是好事。但这事是不容怀疑的。人人都说是阿斯兰下达的命令。我们还亲眼看见他了。我们没有想到阿斯兰会这样做。咳，我们——我们确实盼望阿斯兰回到纳尼亚来。”

“他这次回来好像对我们很恼火，”第一只老鼠说，“我们肯定做了什么可怕的事，自己却不知道。他惩罚我们，一定事出有因。但我觉得，即便我们有过错，他也可以让我们知道啊。”

“我想，我们现在所做的，可能就是错误的，”兔子说。

“即便是错的，我也顾不得那么多，”鼹鼠说，“这样的错，我还会去犯。”

“嘘！”另几只小兽说，“说话小心啊。”他们随后对国王说，“对不起，亲爱的国王，我们得回去了。如果我们被抓住了，那会有麻烦的。”

“亲爱的朋友，赶紧离开我吧，”提里安说，“即便为了整个纳尼亚，我也不能让你们陷入危险中。”

“晚安，晚安，”小兽们一边说，一边在他的膝盖上碰鼻子，“一旦有机会，我们会回来的。”他们窸窸窣窣地走了，整座森林似乎比他们来时更黑暗、更寒冷、更寂寞了。

星星出来了，时间在慢慢地流逝——想象一下时间过得多慢吧——在此期间，纳尼亚最后一位国王就一直被绑在树上，站得身体发僵，腿脚发痛。最后又发生了一件事。

远处出现了一片火光。随即熄灭了一会儿，接着又重新燃起，并越来越明亮、强烈。然后他看见许多黑影在火光周围来回晃动，将成捆的东西背起、放下。他很快看清楚了，那是一堆新点燃的篝火，人们都正忙着向火堆里丢柴火。篝火熊熊地燃烧起来，提里安看出它就在小山顶上。他能清楚地看到篝火后面的马厩被通红的火光照亮了，一大群动物和人出现在篝火的前方。篝火旁边凸现出一个小小的人形，肯定就是猿猴了。他正在跟那群动物说着什么，但他听不清楚。随后猿猴走到马厩的门前，三次将头叩在地上。接着他站起身，打开马厩的门。一只长有四条腿的东西从马厩里走出来——步伐十分僵硬——面对着大家。

一阵哀鸣和嚎叫的声音随即响起，声音很大，提里安能听出部分的意思。

“阿斯兰！阿斯兰！阿斯兰！”野兽们哭喊着，“跟我们说说话吧。安慰安慰我们吧。别生我们的气了。”

提里安从他所在的地方无法清楚地辨认那是一头什么动物，但看得出他是金黄色的，毛蓬蓬的。他从来没有见过伟大的狮王，也从来没有见过一头普通的狮子。他不能断定他所见到的就不是真正的阿斯兰。他只觉得阿斯兰不应该那样僵硬地站着，什么话都不说。这时候谁说得好呢？突然，一种不祥的思绪掠过他的脑海，他想起了关于塔什跟阿斯兰同为一体的奇谈怪论，觉得这一切肯定是一场骗局。

猿猴这时把脑袋凑近那个金黄色的野兽，好像在聆听他对自己低声说的话。然后猿猴转过身来，对着大家说话，所有的动物再次哀鸣起来。金黄色的动物这时已笨拙地转过身去，走回马厩去了——你甚至可说蹒跚而回——猿猴随即关上背后的门。这以后，火光便忽然消失，想必是被扑灭了。提里安再次回到孤独与黑暗中。

他想到了遥远的过去，想到了那些曾经在纳尼亚生活过，如今已不在人世的国王，觉得自己是他们中最不幸的。他想到了祖父的祖父瑞廉国王：当他还是个小王子的时候，就被女巫盗走，长年累月被藏在北方巨人治下的黑暗的山洞里。但后来一切恢复正常：两个来自世界尽头的神秘孩子突然出现，把他救出，使他回到纳尼亚，实现了王国的长治久安。“我就没有这样幸运了，”提里安自言自语地说。

然后他又再往前追溯，想到了瑞廉的父亲，水手凯斯宾。他的邪恶的叔父弥勒兹国王想谋杀他，凯斯宾逃进森林，跟小矮人生活在一起。但最后也是一切恢复正常：凯斯宾获得来自外部世界的孩子们的帮助——那次共有四个孩子——他们帮他打了一仗，使他登上王位。“这事过去很久了，”提里安自言自语地说，“这样的好事现在不会再发生了。”

这以后他继续想起救助过凯斯宾的那四个孩子（他小时候历史课程学得特别好），他们早在一千年前就到过纳尼亚，创下了许多非凡的业绩。正是他们打败了可怕的白女巫，结束了数百年的冬天，四人一起在凯尔帕拉维尔王宫主持国政，直到他们长大成人，成了伟大的国王和女王。他们统治的时期称得上纳尼亚的黄金时代。阿斯兰曾多次出现在他们的故事中；就提里安记忆所及，阿斯兰还在其他许多故事中出现过。“阿斯兰——还有来自另一个世界的孩子，”提里安心里想，“当一切变得最糟糕时，他们总是从天而降。哎呀，如果他们现在能来，那该多好啊。”

提里安失声呼叫起来，“阿斯兰！阿斯兰！阿斯兰！快来救救我们吧。”

但一切依旧那么黑暗，那么寒冷，那么静寂。

“让我被他们杀了吧，”国王呼叫着，“我为自己一无所求。我只求阿斯兰来救救纳尼亚。”

那天晚上，树林里并没有发生任何变化，但在提里安的心里，却有了某种变化。不知为什么，他开始感到有了一线的希望，而且，他还感到自己更强壮了。“阿斯兰啊阿斯兰，”他低声祈祷，“如果你自己不能来，就从另一个世界派来援兵吧。或者让我召唤他们，让我的声音到达那个世界吧。”连他自己也不知道怎么回事，他居然真的扯开嗓子呼叫了起来：

“孩子们！孩子们！纳尼亚的朋友们！快，来我这里。我从遥远的地方呼唤你们。我，提里安，纳尼亚的国王，凯尔帕拉维尔王宫的主人，孤岛的皇帝，向你们求救来了！”

话音刚落，他已进入梦境（如果这是一场梦），这个梦比他以往做过的任何梦都生动得多。

他好像站在一间亮着灯的房间里，那里有七个人围着一张桌子坐着。看样子他们刚刚吃过饭。他们中有两位老人：一位胡子花白的老年男子和一位闪烁着一双聪慧、欢乐的眼睛的老年妇女。站在老年男子右侧的一位还没有成年，显然比提里安还年轻，但他的脸上已经具有王者和勇士的气概。坐在老年妇女右侧的另一位少年也是如此。在桌子的对面，面向提里安的是一位金发少女，比两位少年还年轻；在少女的两侧，是更加年轻的一个男孩和一个女孩。他们所穿的衣服，在提里安看来，是非常奇特的。

但他没有时间去思考这些细节，因为最小的那个男孩和两个女孩见到他都惊奇地跳了起来，其中一个还发出一声尖叫。老年妇女也受了惊，猛吸了口气。老年男子一定突然动了一下，因为放在他右手一侧的酒杯已经给碰翻，掉到桌子底下去了。提里安能听见杯子砸碎在地板上发出的哐啷声。

提里安意识到这些人都看见了他；但他们注视他的样子就好像见到了鬼魂。他同时注意到坐在老年男子右侧的那个具有王者气概的少年始终没有动（尽管他的脸色已经发白），只是紧紧地握住自己的手。他说：

“如果你不是鬼魂或梦幻，说话吧。你看上去像个纳尼亚人，我们就是纳尼亚的七个朋友。”

提里安很想开口说话，很想大声疾呼，告诉他们他就是纳尼亚的提里安，迫切需要帮助。但他发现他说不出任何话来（就像我们在梦中经常出现的情况那样）。

刚才说话的那人站了起来，“不论你是什么人，影子也好，精灵也罢，”说话时他的一双眼睛紧紧地盯住提里安，“只要你来自纳尼亚，我以阿斯兰的名义命令你说话。我就是至尊王彼得。”

提里安眼前的这间房子开始飘浮起来。他听见这七个人都在说话，但声音每一秒钟都在变弱。他们好像在说“看，褪去了”，“融化了”，“消失了”。

这以后他便完全苏醒了，依旧被绑在树上，身体又冷又僵硬。整座树林都沐浴在黎明前那苍白而阴郁的光芒中。他的全身已经被露水打湿了；天快亮了。

梦醒后的一段时间是他一生中最难忍耐的时光。





第五章　援救国王


但国王的苦难并没有持续太久。他的身边突然响起“嘣”的一声，紧接着又是“嘣”的一声，他的眼前已经站着两个孩子。一秒钟以前，他眼前的林子还是空荡荡的；他知道他们不可能从树背后跳出来，因为他没有听见背后有过任何动静。事实上，他们确实是凭空冒出来的。

他第一眼就看出他们身上所穿的正是他梦中见到的人所穿的那种奇特而暗淡的衣服。再看第二眼时，他发现来人就是那七个人中最小的男孩和女孩。

“天哪，”男孩说，“真让人透不过气了！我原以为——”

“快，给他松绑，”女孩说，“有话过会再说。”她补充了一句，随即转身对提里安说：“对不起，我们来晚了。但这已经是我们最快的速度了。”

当她说话时，男孩已经从口袋里拿出一把刀，开始为国王割断绑绳。由于割得太快，当最后一根绳索被割断时，浑身僵硬、麻木的国王一下子仆倒在地上。他的两条腿揉了好一阵子才恢复知觉，终于能站立起来。

“我说，”女孩说，“那天晚上我们正在吃晚饭，你就出现在我们面前了，是不是？差不多一星期了吧。”

“一星期，漂亮的姑娘？”提里安说，“我的梦把我带进你们的世界，才过了十分钟时间啊。”

“时间总是一头雾水，波尔，”男孩说。

“我记起来了，”提里安说，“古老的传说都这么说的。你们那奇怪世界的时间跟我们是不一样的。说到时间，我们得马上离开这里了，我的敌人就在附近。你们能跟我一起走吗？”

“那当然，”女孩说，“我们就是来帮助你的。”

提里安迈开大步，领他们迅速下山，往南行走，以便避开马厩。他知道他得上哪里去，但他选择了一段石子路，为的是不留下脚印；然后他们又涉了水，为的是不留下任何气味。

就这样又爬岩石又蹚水，花了他们大约一个钟头的时间；在此期间，大家都累得气喘吁吁的，根本没工夫说话。即便如此，提里安还是不断地偷看他的伙伴。一想到与他结伴的是来自另一个世界的生灵，他的脑子就有点发晕。切身的经历让古老的故事都显得真实可信了……现在，什么事情都有可能发生。

“现在，”提里安说，这时他们已来到一个小山谷的顶端，眼前是一片尚未成材的白桦林，“我们已暂时脱离危险，可以走慢点了。”太阳已经升起，露珠在树枝上闪烁，鸟儿开始歌唱了。

“来点填肚子的，怎么样？——我指的是你，陛下；我们两人已经用过早餐了，”男孩说。

提里安一时还不明白“填肚子”是什么意思，但当男孩打开一直背在身上的一个鼓鼓囊囊的背包，从中掏出一包留有油渍、软绵绵的东西时，他立刻明白了。他确实饿极了，只是当时一直没来得及想它。

纸包里有两个煮蛋三明治，两个奶酪三明治，还有两个三明治涂着果酱一类的东西。如果不是那么饥饿，提里安是不会惦记果酱一类的食物的，因为在纳尼亚没有人吃这种东西。等到他吃完了六个三明治，他们已经来到山谷的底部，那里有一片长有青苔的岩壁，一股泉水从那里喷涌而出。三人都停了下来，喝了泉水，并用水拍了拍汗涔涔的脸。

“好了，”女孩一边说，一边把湿漉漉的头发甩向脑后，“现在你愿意告诉我们你是谁，为什么被绑，以及有关的一切了吧？”

“非常乐意，小姐，”提里安说，“但我们还不能停下来。”他们于是边走边谈，他告诉他们自己是谁，以及发生在他身上的一切。他最后说：“现在我打算去一个堡垒，那是我祖父在世时修建的三个堡垒之一，专门用来防范居住在灯柱荒野的危险的不法之徒。凭阿斯兰保佑，堡垒的钥匙没有被抢走。在堡垒里我们能找到武器和盔甲，还有食物，虽然那不过是饼干一类的食品。我们可以在那里安全地躺一会儿，制订出我们的计划。好了，请你们也跟我说说你们是谁，以及你们的全部情况吧。”

“我叫尤斯塔斯·斯克罗布，她是吉尔·波尔，”男孩说，“我们曾经来过这里，那是许多世纪以前的事了，按我们的时间计算，也有一年多了。当时有个叫瑞廉的王子，他们把这个小伙子关进地牢，帕德尔格拉姆又把他的脚绑在——”

“啊！”提里安惊呼起来，“那你们就是把瑞廉国王从魔法中解救出来的尤斯塔斯和吉尔了？”

“是的，正是我们，”吉尔说，“你说他现在是瑞廉国王，是不是？噢，他当然要做国王。我忘了——”

“不是，”提里安说，“我是他的第七代后裔。他去世已有二百多年了。”

吉尔做了个鬼脸。“哎哟！”她说，“回到纳尼亚，这个消息真吓人。”

尤斯塔斯接着说：“好了，陛下，你现在知道我们是谁了。事情看来是这样的——教授和波莉姨妈把我们这班纳尼亚的朋友全召集在一起了。”

“我没听说过这几个人的名字，尤斯塔斯，”提里安说。

“他们是最早来过纳尼亚的两个人，当初所有的动物还不会说话呢。”

“我的天！”提里安叫了起来，“原来是这两个人啊！那就是迪格雷勋爵和波莉夫人了！来自远古时代！他们还活在你们那里吗？真是奇迹，真是荣耀！再说给我听听，再说给我听听。”

“她不是我们的亲姨妈，你知道，”尤斯塔斯说，“她是普卢默小姐，我们都叫她波莉姨妈。就是他们两人把我们大家召在一起的，一半为了消遣，以便我们大家能在一起谈谈纳尼亚（当然，这样的事，你跟别人是无法交谈的）；另一半是教授有预感，说不定什么时候这里正好需要我们。

“咳，这以后你就来了，像个鬼魂，像个天知道的什么东西，差一点儿把我们吓得魂不附体。你当时什么话也没有说就消失了。凭此我们知道，一定是这里出了事。接下来的问题是如何到这里来，这不是你想来就能来的。我们为此商量了很久，最后教授说，唯一的办法是通过魔戒。很久以前，他和波莉姨妈就是通过魔戒到达这里的，当年他们还是小伙子和小姑娘，我们这几位年轻的还没有出生。

“但魔戒一直埋在伦敦（那是我们那里的一个大镇，陛下）一幢房子的花园里，房子已经卖给别人了。随后的问题是如何将魔戒弄到手。你永远猜不到我们如何做到这件事的！彼得和爱德蒙（彼得即至尊王，跟你说过话的那位就是）前往伦敦，趁凌晨人们还没有起床就从房子背后进入花园。他们把自己打扮成管道工，如果有人看见，准会以为他们是去修理那里的下水管道的。我真希望自己也跟了去，这确实是一件既体面又有趣的事。第二天，他们就获得了成功，彼得给我发了电报（那是一种通信方法，陛下，以后我会向你解释的），说他们已经得到魔戒。第三天，我和吉尔得回学校去（只有我们两人还在读书，我们在同一所学校上学，陛下），彼得和爱德蒙跟我们约好在去学校的路上碰头，把戒指交给我们。你知道，只能我们两人来纳尼亚，因为年纪大的人不能再来了。

“我们就这样上了火车（那是我们那里用来旅行的交通工具，有许多节车厢连在一起），教授、波莉姨妈和露西陪着我们。我们希望他们尽可能多送我们一程。对了，当时我们就在火车上。快要到达约好见面的那个火车站时，我朝窗口张望着，想看看彼得他们是否已经在那里接我们。就在这时，火车突然可怕地颠簸起来，随即是‘嘣嘣’两声巨响，我们发现自己已在纳尼亚，陛下您就绑在那棵树上。”

“这么说你们没有用魔戒？”提里安说。

“没有，”尤斯塔斯说，“连见也没有见到。阿斯兰用他自己的方式安排了这一切，他是用不着魔戒的。”

“这么说魔戒还在至尊王彼得手里，”提里安说。

“是的，”吉尔说，“但我们觉得他也用不到它了。当另两位王者——爱德蒙王和露西女王——上次在这里时，阿斯兰就说过他们不会再回纳尼亚。同样的话他对至尊王也说过，时间更早些。你完全可以相信，如果他得到允许，他会像一颗子弹那样飞过来的。”

“哎呀，”尤斯塔斯说，“走在太阳底下，天越来越热了。我们快到了吧，陛下？”

“看！”提里安指了指前方。不远处，灰色的城垛从树梢间冒出；再往前走了一两分钟，他们便进入一片开阔的草地。一条小溪流过那里，一座方形的堡垒坐落在小溪的那一边，开着寥寥几个狭长的小窗口，面对着他们的门看上去沉甸甸的。

提里安目光锐利地环顾四周，确信附近没有敌人。然后他走到堡垒前，静立片刻，随即从猎装里掏出一串钥匙。这串钥匙就系在他脖子上的一条银链上，其中两把是金子做的，其他的也都装饰华美：你一看就知道它们要么是用来开启王宫中庄严而机密的房门的，要么就是用来开启那些存放皇家珍宝的香木柜子或盒子的。但现在他插进门锁的那把钥匙却又大又粗，非常普通；那门锁也很笨重，有一阵子，提里安还担心大门会打不开。但他还是成功了：随着一声沉闷的嘎嘎声，堡垒的门旋转开了。

“朋友们，请进！”提里安说，“纳尼亚国王此时接待贵宾，这里恐怕就是最好的王宫了。”

令提里安感到欣慰的是，两位来宾具有良好的教养，他们都说用不着客套，并相信这地方一定很不错。

事实上，这里根本说不上“很不错”。里面黑咕隆咚的，闻起来又湿又潮。整个堡垒只有一个房间，往上直达石头屋顶。房间的一角有一座木头扶梯通向天窗，出了天窗就是雉堞了。房间里摆放着几张可供休息的床铺，许多柜子和包裹。还有一个壁炉，看上去好像许多年没有生过火了。

“我们要不要先出去弄些柴火来？”吉尔说。

“先不要，姑娘，”提里安说。他觉得首先应考虑别让自己赤手空拳被人抓了去，他于是开始搜寻那几个柜子。谢天谢地，幸亏他向来处事谨慎，每年都要检查一次他的防御工事，确保堡垒里储备一切必需的物品。柜子里就有由油绸盖着的弓弦；宝剑和长矛都上过油，以防生锈；盔甲层层包裹着，依然锃亮生辉。还有比这些更好的东西呢。“你们看！”提里安边说边从柜子里拖出一副式样古怪的锁子甲，在两个孩子面前晃动着。

“这副锁子甲很有趣，陛下，”尤斯塔斯说。

“是啊，小伙子，”提里安说，“这不是纳尼亚的小矮人锻造的。这是卡乐门人的锁子甲，样式十分的古怪。我收藏了几套备用，但我不知道我和我的朋友什么时候需要穿上它走过提斯罗克的领地而不被人发现。再看看这个石头瓶子，里面有一种药水，只要涂在手上和脸上，我们的皮肤就像卡乐门人那样灰不溜秋了。”

“好哇！”吉尔叫了起来，“乔装！我喜欢乔装。”

提里安作了示范，教他们如何将药水倒几滴在手掌上，用它擦拭脸和脖子，然后再擦肩膀和手，一直擦到胳膊肘。他自己也这样擦了一遍。

“等身上的药水干了以后，”他说，“我们就可以洗手了，颜色不会褪的。只有用油和灰擦洗，我们才能恢复纳尼亚人的纯白色。来，可爱的吉尔，让我们看看这套锁子甲是否适合你。只是长了点，但情况并不像我担心的那样糟糕。这副锁子甲原先一定是他们某位首领下面的一个随从穿的。”

穿上盔甲后，他们又戴上卡乐门人的头盔，那玩意圆圆的，小小巧巧的，紧扣着头部，盔顶上还有一根铁锥子。提里安接着从柜子里取出一卷长长的白布条，把它绕在头盔上，直到钢盔变成了头巾；但那根铁锥子依然竖在正中。他和尤斯塔斯还配备了卡乐门人的弯刀和小圆盾。但弯刀对于吉尔却显得太重，他于是给了她一把长长的猎刀，那武器在紧要关头也可以当剑使。

“你会放箭吗，小姐？”提里安问。

“那还用说，”吉尔红着脸说，“尤斯塔斯的箭术很不错。”

“不要相信她的话，陛下，”尤斯塔斯说，“自从上次从纳尼亚回去后，我们就一直在练习箭术，她现在的技术跟我差不多了。但我们两人其实都不怎么样。”

提里安给了吉尔一把弓和一个装满箭的箭筒。接下去要做的事是生火，因为堡垒始终更像个山洞，而不像一间屋子，人在里面会发抖的。但通过搬运柴火他们的身体感到暖和了——太阳这时已升上中天——当红通通的火苗蹿上烟囱时，这地方就显得有些喜庆了。

然而，午餐是糟糕的，他们能够做的是将从柜子里找到的干巴巴的饼干碾碎，倒入沸水中，再加上盐，做成一道饼干糊。他们喝的当然也只有水。

“如果我们带一包茶来该多好，”吉尔说。

“或者一听可可也行，”尤斯塔斯说。

“在每一座堡垒里备上一小桶好酒，永远不会有错，”提里安说。





第六章　成功的夜袭


大约四个小时以后，提里安倒在一张床上，抓紧时间睡了一会儿。两个孩子此时已经打起呼噜：提里安在自己上床以前就安顿了他们，因为他们不得不熬大半个晚上；他心里清楚，像他们这样的年纪，没有充足的睡眠是什么事也做不了的。再说，刚才他确实把他们折腾累了。首先，他让吉尔练习箭术，发现她的水平虽然达不到纳尼亚的标准，但也不算差了。事实上，她已经射杀过一只兔子（当然不是会说话的兔子，在纳尼亚西部，有许多普通的兔子），这兔子已经被剥了皮，洗干净后挂起来晾晒。他发现两个孩子都很熟悉这种令人激动、气味难闻的工作，原来在瑞廉王子那个年代，在那次穿越巨人乡的伟大旅程中，他们就学会做这种事了。

然后他又教了尤斯塔斯如何使用剑和盾。尤斯塔斯在他早年的历险中已经学过如何使剑，但那时他使用的是纳尼亚的直剑。他从来没有使用过卡乐门的弯刀；由于多种技法截然不同，许多从直剑掌握的习惯都得纠正过来，这就使练习变得困难了。但提里安发现他目光锐利，脚步敏捷。令人惊讶的是两个孩子的力量：他们显然比几个小时前他刚见到他们时强壮了许多，人也好像高大、成熟了许多。这是纳尼亚的空气对来自我们这个世界的访问者产生的一个影响。

他们三人都觉得应该做的第一件事是回到马厩山，设法先救出独角兽珠厄儿。这以后，如果一切顺利，他们可以向东撤退，去和人头马鲁威特从凯尔帕拉维尔带来的军队会合。

像提里安这样有经验的战士和猎手总能做到随心所欲，想在什么时候苏醒就什么时候苏醒。那天晚上他规定自己睡到九点钟，然后便排除一切干扰，迅速入睡。当他醒来时，时间好像只过了一会儿，但凭着夜色和感觉，他知道自己把睡眠的时间控制得很准确。他站起身，戴上头巾盔（他是穿着锁子甲睡的），唤醒两个孩子。说句实话，当他们爬出床铺的时候，他们看上去很有点萎靡不振，还连连打了好几个哈欠。

“现在，”提里安说，“我们就从这里朝正北的方向走——幸运的是，晚上有星星——这条路比我们早上走的那条短许多，因为早上我们绕了大弯，现在走的是捷径。如果有人盘问，你们两人千万别说话，让我装成满嘴粗话、趾高气扬的卡乐门首领与他们周旋。如果我拔出弯刀，你，尤斯塔斯，也将弯刀拔出来；吉尔这时就退到我们背后，搭起弓箭。如果我喊一声‘撤！’你们两人就赶紧朝堡垒跑。谁也不可以恋战，只要我下达撤退的指令——多打一个回合也不行；在战场上，这种多余的勇气不知打乱过多少周密的计划。朋友们，以阿斯兰的名义，让我们出发吧。”

他们于是出了堡垒，进入寒冷的夜色之中。北部天空中所有明亮的星星都在树梢上燃烧。纳尼亚的北极星叫作矛尖星；它比我们这个世界的北极星明亮得多。

有一阵子，他们可以朝着矛尖星的方向笔直往前走；但不久遇到了茂密的灌木丛，就只好绕道而行了。这以后，由于头顶有树枝覆盖，辨别方向变得很困难。这时是吉尔使他们走在正道上：在英格兰时她就是个杰出的向导。过去在纳尼亚北部荒野旅行的经历，使她能清楚辨认那些星星；即便矛尖星被树木挡住，她照样能凭其他的星星辨别正确的方向。

提里安很快发现吉尔是他们三人中最好的探路人，便让她走到前面；他还惊奇地发现，她走过他们身边时，居然悄然无声，好像隐了身一般。

“我的天！”他悄悄地对尤斯塔斯说，“这女孩是个神奇的林中仙子。即便她具有树精的血统，也不可能做得比这更好。”

“她个子小，这对她特别有利，”尤斯塔斯轻声说。走在前面的吉尔打断他，“嘘——声音轻点。”

周围的树林静悄悄的。确实太安静了。纳尼亚的夜晚通常是有声响的：偶尔会有刺猬愉快地招呼“晚安”，猫头鹰在头顶高声啼叫，远处也许还能传来笛声，告诉你有羊怪在跳舞，或者地下还能传来小矮人敲敲打打的声音。但这一切全没有了；忧伤和恐惧笼罩着整个纳尼亚。

过了一会儿，他们开始爬上陡峭的山坡，那里的树木开始稀疏起来。提里安已能依稀看见那个著名的山顶和马厩。吉尔走得越来越谨慎，她还不停地打手势，示意其他两位也警觉起来。而后她突然站住，身子一动不动，提里安看见她慢慢下蹲，悄无声息地隐身于草丛中。过了一会儿，她站了起来，把嘴凑近提里安的耳朵，以最轻微的声音对提里安说：“趴下，瞧得更清。”她特意用了“瞧”，而不说“看”，就因为“看”这个字的音阶较高，容易被人偷听。

提里安赶紧趴下身子，几乎跟吉尔一样没有发出声响，但多少还是有点动静，因为他的身体比吉尔笨重，年纪也比她大许多。趴下后，从他们所在的地方，他随即看见小山的边缘映衬在繁星满天的夜空中。两个影子兀立在山顶：一个是马厩；另一个，在马厩前方几米处，是卡乐门哨兵。这哨兵没有做好他的警戒工作：既没有来回走动，也没有站着，而是坐在地上，长矛放在背后，下巴耷拉在胸口。

“好样的，”提里安对吉尔说。她已经让他看到了他想看见的一切。

他们站了起来，这会是提里安走在前面了。离哨兵不到四十英尺的地方有一个小灌木丛，他们朝这灌木丛走过去，走得很慢，几乎不敢呼吸。

“你们在这里等着，直到我回来，”他对两个孩子小声说，“如果我失手了，你们就逃跑。”然后他大摇大摆地朝敌人的哨兵走过去。哨兵看见了他，吃了一惊，正打算站起来：他以为提里安是他的长官，他会因坐着带来麻烦。但他还没来得及站起，提里安已在他面前蹲下一条腿，说：

“你是提斯罗克的战士吧？——但愿提斯罗克万寿无疆！很高兴能在纳尼亚的野兽和魔鬼中间见到你。我们握个手吧，朋友。”

卡乐门哨兵还不知道发生了什么事，他的手已经被紧紧抓住。随即他的两腿已被提里安的膝盖顶住，一把匕首对准了他的脖子。

“别声张，否则就是死，”提里安在他的耳边说，“如果想活命，告诉我独角兽在哪里。”

“在——在马厩背后，我的长官。”这个可怜虫说话的声音都结巴了。

“好。起来。带我到他那里。”

哨兵站了起来，提里安的匕首一直抵着他的脖子。当提里安转身到他的背后时，匕首（凉凉的，痒痒的）也绕着他的脖子转了一圈，抵在了他耳朵的下方。哨兵颤抖着来到马厩的背后。

虽然天色暗淡，提里安还是一眼就看见了珠厄儿那白晃晃的身躯。

“嘘！”他说，“别出声。珠厄儿，是我。他们怎样绑你的？”

“我的四条腿都有绳子拴着，马勒上的缰绳系在墙上的一个铁环上，”珠厄儿说。

“哨兵，背靠在墙上，给我站好了。就这样。珠厄儿，用你的尖角抵住卡乐门人的胸口。”

“遵命，陛下，”珠厄儿说。

“如果他动一动，就刺穿他的心脏。”提里安用了几秒钟割断绳子，然后拿割剩下的部分捆绑哨兵的手和脚。提里安还让他张开嘴，塞了他一嘴的青草；为了防止他叫喊，还将他的嘴连同下巴扎在一起，最后强制他坐下，身子贴住墙壁。

“伙计，原谅我对你不够礼貌，”提里安说，“但这是必要的。如果我们还能见面，那时我也许会对你客气些。珠厄儿，让我们悄悄走吧。”

提里安用左臂搂住独角兽的脖子，弯下腰吻了吻他的鼻子，双方都很高兴。他们悄悄回到刚才他离开两个孩子的地方。树底下的夜色显得更暗淡了；提里安一时没能看清尤斯塔斯，差点撞在他的身上。

“一切顺利，”提里安低声对尤斯塔斯说，“今晚很成功。我们可以回去了。”

他们转过身走了几步，这时尤斯塔斯小声地呼喊起来，“吉尔，你在哪里？”没有回答。“陛下，吉尔会不会在你那边？”

“什么？”提里安说，“她不在你这边吗？”

事情真有点可怕了。他们不敢大声呼叫，只能用最响的低语声呼唤她的名字。依然没有回答。

“我离开以后，她就走开了吗？”

“我没看见，也没听见她走开，”尤斯塔斯说，“但她能够走得神不知鬼不觉，就像一只猫，这你自己是见识过的。”

这时，远处传来了打鼓的声音。珠厄儿朝前方伸了伸耳朵，说：“是小矮人。”

“奸诈的小矮人，很可能是敌人，”提里安喃喃地说。

“有蹄子的声音，越来越近了，”珠厄儿说。

两人和独角兽都一动不动地站着。此时需要提防的事太多了，他们一时不知道怎么办好。蹄子的声音逐渐靠近。

一个声音在离他们很近的地方轻轻响起，“哈啰！你们在这里吗？”

谢天谢地，是吉尔的声音。

“你到什么鬼地方去了啊？”尤斯塔斯没好气地低语说，因为他刚才确实受了惊吓。

“我在马厩里，”吉尔喘着气说，但这是竭力克制着哈哈大笑的那种喘息。

“噢，”尤斯塔斯怒气冲冲地说，“你觉得好玩，是不是？我要说的是——”

“你们找到珠厄儿了吗？”吉尔问。

“找到了，他在这里。你身边是什么野兽？”

“就是他，”吉尔说，“趁他们都还没有醒来，我们赶紧回去吧。”她随即抑制不住还是小声地笑了起来。

其他的人照办了，因为他们在这个危机四伏的地方确实已经逗留太久；小矮人的鼓声似乎离他们越来越近了。

他们向南行走出了几分钟后，尤斯塔斯才开始问她：

“你刚才说‘就是他’，这话是什么意思？”

“假阿斯兰呀，”吉尔说。

“什么？”提里安说，“你刚才去了哪里？做了什么事？”

“是这样的，陛下，”吉尔说，“刚才我一看见你带走了哨兵，就想到马厩里去看看，想知道那里面究竟有什么东西。我一路爬过去。马厩的门一拉就开了。当然，里面漆黑一团，气味跟其他马厩没有两样。我然后擦亮了一根火柴——你能相信吗？——马厩里什么也没有，只有这只身上裹着一块狮子皮的老驴。我拔出刀子，告诉他必须跟我走。其实我根本用不着用刀子威胁他。他早已厌倦了马厩，很愿意跟我走——你说是不是，亲爱的帕塞尔？”

“我的天！”尤斯塔斯说，“我真该死，真该死！刚才我还对你发脾气呢。我现在还觉得你这样瞒着我们悄悄溜走是很卑鄙的。我必须承认——我的意思是说——你干了一件极其漂亮的事。如果她是个男孩，她一定能敕封为骑士，你说是吗，陛下？”

“如果她是个男孩，”提里安说，“得先吃一顿鞭子，因为她不服从命令。”由于天黑，谁也不知道他说这话时是在皱眉还是在微笑。随后是一声金属摩擦的声音。

“你这是要干什么，陛下？”珠厄儿急切地问。

“把剑拔出来，砍下这头该死的驴的脑袋，”提里安凶狠地说。“闪开，姑娘！”

“啊，别！别杀他！”吉尔说，“真的，你不可以杀他。这不是他的错。错都在猿猴身上。他也蒙在鼓里。他也是可怜的。他是一头好驴。他的名字叫帕塞尔。我现在用双手抱着他的脖子。”

“吉尔，”提里安说，“在我所有的臣民中，你是最勇敢最聪明的，同时又是最鲁莽最不听话的。好了，让这头驴活下去吧。你有什么话说，驴子？”

“我吗，陛下？”驴开口说话了，“如果我犯了错，我确实很抱歉。猿猴说阿斯兰喜欢看见我打扮成这副模样。我以为他是什么都知道的。我不如他聪明。我只是按他的指示去做。对我来说，住在马厩里一点儿乐趣都没有。我甚至不知道外面发生了什么事。到了晚上，他也只允许我出来一两分钟。有几天他们还忘了给我水喝。”

“陛下，”珠厄儿说，“那些小矮人越来越近了。我们要不要去见见他们？”

提里安思考了一会儿，突然大声地笑了起来。这一次他说话不再是低声细语。

“狮王在上，”他说，“我变得越来越迟钝了！见见他们？我们当然要见见他们。我们现在要见见任何人。我们要让他们看看这头驴子。让他们见见他们一直望而生畏、顶礼膜拜的这头畜生。我们要让他们看到猿猴罪恶阴谋的真相。他的秘密揭穿了。世道改变了。明天我们要把猿猴吊在纳尼亚最高的一棵树上。从此再也不必窃窃私语、躲躲藏藏、乔装打扮了。这些诚实的小矮人在哪里？我们要把好消息告诉他们。”

当你长时间地悄悄说话以后，突然听见有人大声说话，那种感觉是令人振奋的。所有的人都开始大声说笑；就连帕塞尔也昂起头，发出一声洪亮的“咹呃——咹呃”：猿猴禁止他这样叫唤已经有许多天了。

然后他们就朝鼓声响起的方向走去。鼓声变得越来越响，不久，他们还看见了火把。小矮人们就从贯穿灯柱荒野的一条崎岖不平的道路上走过来（在英格兰，没有人会把它称为“道路”）。他们见到有三十来个小矮人在踏着健步行进着，肩膀上都扛着小铁锹和鹤嘴锄。两个武装的卡乐门人走在队伍的前面，另有两个武装的卡乐门人断后。

“站住！”提里安走上前去，大声吆喝说，“站住，士兵们！你们把纳尼亚的小矮人带到什么地方去？是谁下的命令？”





第七章　小矮人们


走在队列前面的两个卡乐门士兵看见提里安，一开始还当他是带着两个卫士的卡乐门王爷，便赶紧停下脚步，举起手中的长矛向他致敬。

“我的主人，”一个士兵说，“我们带这班小矮人去卡乐门，到提斯罗克的矿山去做工——愿提斯罗克万寿无疆。”

“我凭塔什大神发誓，他们倒真听话，”提里安说。然后他突然转向小矮人们。他们每六个人就有一人举着火炬，借着闪闪烁烁的火光，他能看见那一张张胡子拉碴的脸在盯着他看，表情严肃而固执。

“小矮人们，你们如此心甘情愿地去普格拉汉的盐坑送死，是不是提斯罗克打了一个大胜仗，征服了你们的国土？”

两个士兵惊讶地看着他。小矮人七嘴八舌地回答说：“阿斯兰的命令，阿斯兰的命令。他卖掉了我们，我们怎么能反对他啊？”

“其实是提斯罗克的命令！”其中一个小矮人一边说，一边还吐了口唾沫，“我倒要看看他是怎样骗人的。”

“闭嘴，你这狗东西！”为首的士兵呵斥说。

“你们看！”提里安将帕塞尔拉到火光底下，“这全是一个骗局。阿斯兰根本没有来纳尼亚。你们都上了猿猴的当了。他从马厩里带出来让你们看的就是这头畜生。好好看看他吧。”

小矮人现在能就近看个仔细了，他们亲眼所见的景象足以使他们相信自己受到了愚弄。由于长时间被囚禁在马厩里，驴子身上的狮皮已经很不整洁；这次穿过黑暗的树林，一路上少不了磕磕碰碰，更使狮皮变得皱皱巴巴，大部分皮毛都挤到一侧的肩膀上。狮头上的皮毛不仅挤歪了，而且还往后缩了一大截，现在谁都能看见那张愚蠢而温和的驴脸从伪装中露出。他的嘴角上还挂着几根青草，因为这一路过来，他一直在偷偷地啃吃路边的青草。他现在还在一个劲地唠叨：“这不是我的错。我不聪明。我从来没说过自己是聪明的。”

小矮人们张大嘴巴注视了帕塞尔片刻。一个卡乐门士兵尖叫起来：“我的长官，你疯了吗？你对这些奴隶说了什么呀？”另一个士兵说：“你是谁？”他们的长矛不再向提里安致敬；两人都将武器从肩膀上放下，准备战斗了。

“说出口令！”为首的士兵说。

国王抽出弯刀，说：“我的口令是‘天亮了，谎言破灭了’。浑蛋，保护好你自己吧，我是纳尼亚的提里安。”

说完，他便闪电般地扑向为首的士兵。尤斯塔斯一见国王拔剑在手，也赶紧把他的剑拔出，冲向另一个士兵。他的脸苍白得像一张纸，但我们不应该因此责备他。像某些初上战场的人一样，他也是吉星高照。他完全忘记了当天下午提里安教过他的技法，只知道乱砍一气（我不敢肯定他是否闭着眼睛），但大大出乎意外的是，那个卡乐门人已经躺在地上一命呜呼了。虽然这是很大的安慰，但当时的情形，也真让人胆战心惊。国王的战斗延续了一两秒钟，最后也将那人杀了。他朝尤斯塔斯呼喊：“还有两个呢。”

剩下的两个卡乐门人被小矮人解决了。敌人已经全部毙命。

“打得好，尤斯塔斯！”提里安拍了拍他的背，欢呼说，“小矮人们，你们自由了。明天我要带你们去解放整个纳尼亚。胜利属于阿斯兰！”

但随后的情况却十分糟糕。只有少数几个小矮人（大约五个）响应他，声音微弱，很快消逝了。好几个小矮人在愤怒地吼叫。更多的小矮人保持沉默。

“他们没有听清楚吗？”吉尔不耐烦地说，“你们这班小矮人脑子有病吗？你们没有听见国王说的话吗？一切都过去了。猿猴不会再统治纳尼亚了。每个人都恢复了正常的生活。你们又可以玩了。这你们还不高兴吗？”

安静了好一会儿，随后有个长相不那么好看，头发和胡子黑得像煤烟的小矮人说：“你是什么人啊，小姐？”

“我是吉尔，”她说，“就是从巫婆手里救过瑞廉国王的那个吉尔——这是尤斯塔斯，当年我们是在一起的——几百年过去了，我们又从另一个世界回到这里。阿斯兰派我们来的。”

小矮人们你看看我，我看看你，都笑了起来，那是一种轻蔑的嘲笑，不是欢笑。

“好了，”黑胡子小矮人（他的名字叫格里佛尔）说，“我不知道你们是怎样想的，但关于阿斯兰，我已经听过太多，今生今世不想再听了。”

“说得好，说得好，”其他的小矮人呼叫起来，“这只是一个骗局，一个十足的骗局。”

“你们说什么？”提里安说。刚才作战时，他的脸色没有发白，这会却发白了。他原以为现在该是无比美好的时刻，结果却像一场噩梦。

“你一定以为我们都是十足的笨蛋，你一定是这样想的，”格里佛尔说，“我们已经上当过一次，现在你又想让我们上第二次当。听我说，关于阿斯兰的故事，对我们已经没有用处。看看他吧！一头长耳朵的老驴！”

“天哪，你把我气疯了，”提里安说，“我们谁说过他就是阿斯兰？那是猿猴想冒充阿斯兰。这你都不明白吗？”

“你们冒充得更高明，我觉得！”格里佛尔说，“不谢了。我们已经被愚弄了一次，不想再被你们愚弄。”

“我没有愚弄你们，”提里安说，“我听从真正的阿斯兰的召唤。”

“那他在哪里？他是谁？让我们看看他！”好几个小矮人说。

“你们以为我可以把他藏在口袋里吗，你们这班傻瓜？”提里安说，“如果阿斯兰能按我的吩咐现身，那我成了什么人？他不是一只温驯的狮子。”

这话一出口，他便意识到自己说了一句没用的话。小矮人即刻以嘲笑的怪腔怪调重复着这句话：“不是一只温驯的狮子，不是一只温驯的狮子。早就有人跟我们反复说过这句话了。”

“你们这是说，你们并不相信真正的阿斯兰？”吉尔说，“但我见过他。是他派我们两人从另一个世界到这儿来的。”

“哈哈，”格里佛尔狂笑起来，“你是这样说的吗？他们教了你这一切。你是给我们上课，是不是？”

“混账东西！”提里安呵斥着，“你竟敢当着一个高贵女子的面胡说八道！”

“把你的礼貌留在你自己的脑子里吧，先生，”小矮人回答，“我觉得，我们并不需要太多的国王——如果你是提里安，但我总觉得你并不像他——我们也不需要什么阿斯兰。从今往后，我们要照顾好自己，再不向别人脱帽致敬。你懂我的意思吗？”

“说得好，”其他的小矮人说，“我们现在只相信自己。不再相信阿斯兰，不再相信国王，不再相信有关其他世界的愚蠢故事。小矮人拥护小矮人。”他们开始回到队列之中，准备返回自己的居地。

“小畜生！”尤斯塔斯说，“把你们从盐矿救出来，你们连句‘谢谢’也不说吗？”

“我们全知道的，”格里佛尔回过头来说，“你们想利用我们，这就是你们救我们的原因。你们在玩你们的把戏。伙计们，走啊。”

小矮人们伴随着鼓声唱起怪腔怪调的进行曲，很快踏进夜色之中。

提里安和他的朋友们看着他们远去，随后他只简单地说了一个字：“走。”大家便继续上路了。

谁都一言不发。帕塞尔依然觉得自己很丢人，但他同时也弄不懂究竟发生了什么事。吉尔厌恶那班小矮人，尤斯塔斯战胜卡乐门人取得胜利令她感动，同时也令她惭愧。至于尤斯塔斯，他的心仍在怦怦地跳。

提里安和珠厄儿心情沉重地走在后面。国王将自己的手臂搁在独角兽的肩膀上，独角兽则时不时地用鼻子温柔地擦碰国王的脸。他们没有用语言安慰对方；他们一时也想不出什么样的话能安慰对方。提里安做梦也没有想到猿猴假冒阿斯兰最后会导致他的子民怀疑起真正的阿斯兰。他原以为，只要他向小矮人们说清楚他们如何受了骗，他们一定会站在他这一边。这样，明天晚上他就可以带领他们回到马厩山，向所有的动物揭示帕塞尔的本来面目。到那时，人人都会转而反对猿猴，也许还会再跟卡乐门人打上一仗，所有的事情就一了百了。但现在，他的如意算盘显然落空了。还有多少纳尼亚的子民会像小矮人那样对待他呢？

“好像有人在追赶我们，陛下，”帕塞尔突然说。

他们停下脚步听了听。确实，他们的背后响起了小小的脚步声。

“那边是谁？”国王大声喝问。

“是我，陛下，”一个声音说，“我是小矮人波金。我刚刚想办法脱离了他们。我站在您和阿斯兰这一边，陛下。只要你给我一把小矮人的刀，我一定乐意为正义的一方血战到底。”

大家都围住他，向他表示欢迎，称赞他，拍了拍他的肩膀。当然，仅一个小矮人对局势不会有多大改观，但毕竟是件开心的事。大伙都振奋起来。但吉尔和尤斯塔斯并没有高兴多久，因为他们打起了哈欠，脑袋耷拉下来：他们太累了，只想早点儿上床睡觉。

黎明前是晚上最寒冷的时刻，他们终于回到堡垒。如果这时有一顿现成的饭，他们一定会吃得很开心；但没有想到的是，要想吃到这一顿饭，既费力又费时。他们喝的是小溪里的水，还用水拍了拍脸，然后便倒在床上睡了。帕塞尔和珠厄儿却说待在室外比室内更舒服。这倒也好，因为让独角兽和一只长得肥肥胖胖的驴子留在室内，确实会有拥挤不堪的感觉。

纳尼亚的小矮人虽然身高不到四英尺，却是最能吃苦耐劳、最强壮有力的，波金就是这样的小矮人。尽管劳累了一整天，晚上又睡得晚，但第二天他比谁都起得早，而且精神十分饱满。他拿了吉尔的弓出去，射杀了两只鸽子。然后他在门口坐下来，一边给鸽子拔毛，一边跟珠厄儿和帕塞尔闲谈。

那天早上，帕塞尔的情绪比以前好多了。珠厄儿身为独角兽，是最高贵优雅的一种动物，他对驴子十分友好。他们所谈的话题也是双方都能理解的，如青草啦，糖啦，蹄子的保养啦，等等。

上午十点半左右，吉尔和尤斯塔斯才打着哈欠、揉着眼睛从堡垒出来。小矮人指给他们看什么地方能采集到一种叫弗雷斯尼的纳尼亚野草，它的形状很像我们英格兰的酢浆草，但煮熟后吃起来比酢浆草的味道好得多（要想烹调得美味可口，最好放一点儿黄油和胡椒，可惜这些配料他们没有）。他们就这样东拼西凑，在忙着做一顿丰盛的饭食，你可以叫它早餐，也可以叫它午餐，随你怎么叫都行，就看你高兴。提里安还带了斧子进入树林，砍了一些树枝回来当柴火。

在饭做好以前——做饭的时间显得很长，尤其是闻上去越来越香，接近做好时，时间就显得更漫长了——国王为波金找来了一套适合小矮人用的装备：一副锁子甲、一个头盔、一面盾、一把剑、一根皮带和一把匕首。然后他检查了尤斯塔斯的宝剑，发现他没有擦去卡乐门人留下的血污就将剑插回鞘里，便批评了他，责成他揩干血迹，擦亮剑面。

吉尔一直在走来走去，她时而搅搅锅里煮着的食物，时而羡慕地朝外面正在心满意足地吃着草的驴子和独角兽看看。那天上午，不知有多少回，她真恨不得自己也能那样惬意地吃草！

但当食物终于上来时，人人都觉得这漫长的等待是值得的；吃完了一份，每人还能再续一份。

等到吃饱喝足，三个人类和一个小矮人便在门口坐了下来，两只四足动物则在他们对面躺下；小矮人得到吉尔和提里安的允许，还点上了他的烟斗。这时国王对小矮人说：“波金朋友，有关敌人的情况，你比我们了解。请你详细通报一下。先说说关于我脱险以后的谣言吧。”

“陛下，他们所编的谣言，是再狡猾不过了，”波金说，“都是那只大黄猫，谣言都是他说的，很可能就是他编的。这只大黄猫，陛下——他是滑头的猫当中最滑头的一只——他说他当时正好从那些恶棍绑陛下的那棵树旁边走过。他说（恕我直言相告）您正在骂骂咧咧，诅咒着阿斯兰。‘原话我就不重复了’，这是他使用的措辞，神态一本正经，煞有介事——您知道，猫是能玩这样的花招的，只要他愿意。大黄猫然后说，阿斯兰这时突然在闪电中现身，一口吞下了陛下您。

“所有的动物听了大黄猫的故事都瑟瑟发抖，有的当场晕倒。当然，猿猴也在帮腔。猿猴说：‘看看阿斯兰是怎样对待不尊敬他的动物的吧；让这件事成为对大家的警告吧。’可怜的动物们哭哭啼啼地说：‘是啊，是啊。’就这样，陛下这次脱险，谁都没有想过是由于贵人相助，而是让大家对猿猴更害怕，更俯首帖耳。”

“多可恶的诡计！”提里安说，“看来这只大黄猫是猿猴的同谋了。”

“现在的情况是倒过来了，陛下，可以说猿猴是大黄猫的同谋，”小矮人回答，“你知道，猿猴酗酒。我相信，他们的阴谋现在主要由大黄猫和卡乐门人的头领利什达来实行。大黄猫散布的谣言针对的就是他们强加于您的不体面的逃离。我可以把其中的原因告诉您。

“前天晚上的深夜，那个可怕的会议刚刚开完，我正走在回家的路上，突然想起我把烟斗遗忘在开会的地方了。这是一个很好的烟斗，多年的心爱之物，我于是回去寻找。还没有走到刚才坐过的地方（当时一团漆黑），我便听见一声猫叫，随后是一个卡乐门人在说：‘这儿——声音轻点。’我当时就一动不动地站住了。这两个家伙就是大黄猫和那个称作‘王爷’的利什达。

“‘高贵的王爷，’大黄猫以奉承的口吻说，‘今天我们说到阿斯兰并不强于塔什，我很想知道我们双方的真实意思。’

“‘众猫中最有悟性的猫啊，’另一个声音说，‘你显然已经懂得我的意思了。’

“‘你的意思是，’大黄猫说，‘无论阿斯兰或塔什，两者都不存在。’

“‘只要是有觉悟的人，谁都知道这一点。’王爷说。

“‘那我们就是知己了，’大黄猫喵喵地叫起来，‘你是否跟我一样，也有点讨厌那只猿猴呢？’

“‘一只愚蠢而贪婪的野兽，’另一个说，‘但眼下我们还得利用他。我们必须暗中布置一切，让猿猴按我们的意志去做。’

“‘让更多有觉悟的纳尼亚人参与我们的计划，’大黄猫说，‘岂不更好吗？我们应该一个一个去争取。真正相信阿斯兰的动物是靠不住的：猿猴一旦因愚蠢暴露了自己的机密，他们随时会转变立场。只有那些既不关心塔什也不关心阿斯兰的动物，即那些眼睛只盯着自己的利益，只关心当纳尼亚成为卡乐门的一个省份时，提斯罗克会给他们什么好处的动物，才是靠得住的。”

“‘说得好，老猫，’利什达说，‘我们确实应该谨慎行事。’”

小矮人回顾了他所听到的一切，这时，天色似乎忽然变了。他们刚才坐下时，天还是晴朗的。现在帕塞尔感到冷了。珠厄儿不安地晃动着脑袋。吉尔抬头看了看天。

“乌云密布起来了，”她说。

“天真冷，”帕塞尔说。

“狮王在上，确实有点冷，”提里安一边说，一边呵了呵手，“呸！这是什么气味啊？太难闻了。”

“咦！”尤斯塔斯喘着气说，“好像是死了什么东西。什么地方有鸟的尸体？刚才我们为什么没有注意到呢？”

独角兽忽地从地上站起，向前举起他的独角。

“看！”他惊叫起来，“看那里！看，快看！”

他们都看见了；他们的脸上都露出惊愕的神情。





第八章　老鹰带来的消息


在树木的阴影中，在远处的开阔地上，有什么东西在移动。那东西向着北方缓慢滑行。乍一看，你会误认为它是一团烟雾，因为它是灰白色的，而且还能透过它的身躯看出去。但那股尸体般的臭味是一般的烟团不会有的。而且，这东西保持着自身的形体，不像烟雾那样起起伏伏，缭绕飘忽。它具有模糊的人形，还有一个鸟头；像猛禽那样长着凶残的钩形嘴。它还有四条手臂，高高地举过头顶，向着北方伸展，好像要抓住整个纳尼亚。它的手指——总共有二十个——跟它的嘴一样是弯曲的，没有指甲，只有又长又锋利的爪子。它行进在草地上，与其说行走，不如说飘浮；所到之处，绿草似乎枯萎了。

帕塞尔只看了一眼，便惊恐地发出一声驴叫，逃进了堡垒。吉尔（你知道，她并不胆小）用手蒙住脸，不敢再看。其他的人看了大约一分钟，直到它进入右侧的密林，随即消失。太阳重新出来，鸟儿又开始鸣叫。

每个人恢复了正常的呼吸，活动起四肢。刚才怪物出现时，他们一个个呆若木鸡。

“这是什么东西啊？”尤斯塔斯小声说。

“这东西我见过一次，”提里安说，“但那时候它是雕刻在石块上，镀着金，眼睛是用钻石镶嵌的。当时我的年纪跟你差不多，作为客人前往提斯罗克在塔什邦的王宫访问。提斯罗克陪同我进入塔什大神的庙宇。就在那里我见到了这只鸟，就雕刻在祭坛的上方。”

“那么，这个——这个东西——就是塔什神吗？”

提里安没有回答，只是把手放到吉尔的后背，说：“你怎么啦，小姐？”

“好了，”吉尔一边说，一边把手从苍白的脸上放下，勉强笑了笑，“我没事。刚才有点恶心。”

“这么说，”独角兽说，“塔什倒是真的存在了。”

“是啊，”小矮人说，“但猿猴这个傻瓜却不相信塔什的存在，他会得到报应的！他召唤塔什，塔什就来了。”

“它——他——这东西——去了哪里？”吉尔问。

“往北，去了纳尼亚的中心，”提里安说，“它来跟我们住在一起了。他们召唤它，它就来了。”

“嗬嗬嗬！”小矮人擦着多毛的双手笑着说，“这会让猿猴大吃一惊的。人们是不应该召唤魔鬼的，除非他们真有这个意思。”

“谁知道猿猴能不能看见塔什？”珠厄儿说。

“帕塞尔哪里去了？”尤斯塔斯问。

他们呼喊帕塞尔的名字，吉尔绕到堡垒的另一边，看看他是不是去了那里。

正当大家找得不耐烦时，他那灰褐色的大脑袋小心翼翼地从门口探出，问：“它走了吗？”大家把他从堡垒里推出，帕塞尔的身体依然在颤抖，就像一只狗遇到了暴风雨。

“我现在明白了，”帕塞尔说，“我确实是一头坏驴。我永远不应该听雪夫特的话。我从来没有想过会发生这样的事。”

“如果你少花点时间说自己不聪明，多花点时间想办法让自己聪明起来——”尤斯塔斯开口说，但吉尔打断了他的话头。

“哟，别责备可怜的帕塞尔了，”她说，“这完全是一个误会。亲爱的帕塞尔，你说是吗？”她吻了吻他的鼻子。

尽管所见的怪物给他们带来了惊吓，大家还是继续交谈起来。

珠厄儿没有什么可以跟大家说的。在他被囚禁期间，一直被绑在马厩的背后，敌人的计划他压根没有听见。他被他们踢过（他也回踢过），鞭打过，还受过死亡的威胁，除非他愿意说他相信每天晚上被猿猴带出来让大家看的就是阿斯兰。事实上，如果不被救出，那天早上他就被处决了。他根本不知道善良的羔羊们究竟出了什么事。

现在他们需要做出决定：当天晚上是回到马厩山，让纳尼亚人见到帕塞尔，使他们明白自己受了愚弄好呢，还是悄悄向东进发，与人头马鲁威特从凯尔帕拉维尔带来的援兵会合，然后再回来抵抗猿猴和卡乐门人。

提里安很想执行第一个方案：他一分钟也不想再让猿猴无缘无故地继续恫吓他治下的百姓。但从另一方面看，昨天晚上小矮人的所作所为已是一个警示：即便让大家看到帕塞尔，你也无法确定他们究竟会有怎样的反应。需要认真对付的还有卡乐门士兵。据波金估计，他们大约有三十来人。如果所有的纳尼亚人都站在提里安一边，他相信，有了珠厄儿、两个孩子，再加上波金（帕塞尔是算不了数的），他是有机会打败他的敌人的。但如果有一半纳尼亚人——包括所有的小矮人——都袖手旁观，甚至与他为敌，那又会有什么样的结果呢？风险太大了。还有形如阴霾的塔什，它又会做点什么呢？

正如波金所说，留给猿猴一两天时间去应付他的难局也未尝不是好事。现在他已牵不出驴子供大家观看。他——或者大黄猫——要想再编出一个故事来自圆其说，那也不是轻而易举的事。如果动物们不断要求见到阿斯兰，而“阿斯兰”始终带不出来，到那时，即便头脑最简单的动物也会起疑心的。

最后，大家一致认为，最好的办法还是先去与鲁威特会合。

一旦做出决定，每个人的心情就好多了。说句老实话，这并不意味着他们害怕打仗（吉尔和尤斯塔斯也许是例外）。但是，在他们的内心深处，谁也不愿意走近那个可怕的鸟头怪物，无论看得见或看不见，那怪物现在也许就在马厩山。不管怎么说，一个人只要拿定主意，心情总比举棋不定时好一些。

提里安说，他们现在有必要卸下伪装，因为他们不想被人误认为卡乐门人；如果碰到忠诚的纳尼亚人，说不定还会因伪装而遭受自己人的攻击。小矮人用炉膛里的烟灰和着油罐子里的油脂（那油脂原本用于擦拭宝剑和长矛），调制出一种样子难看的清洗膏。他们随后脱下卡乐门人的盔甲，来到溪水边。

难看的膏状物像肥皂一样冒起泡泡。提里安和两个孩子蹲在溪水边，擦着脖子，或用手拨开、或用嘴吹开泡沫的样子，看上去真像一幅充满温情的家庭生活画。然后他们返回堡垒，个个红光满面、精神焕发，就像参加聚会的人刻意梳妆打扮过一样。他们按照纳尼亚人的方式，用直剑和三角盾重新武装了自己。“这才是我自己，”提里安说，“我觉得自己又是个真正的男子汉了。”

帕塞尔恳切地请求把狮皮从身上脱下。他抱怨狮皮太热，皱巴巴地贴在背上让他很不舒服，而且还让他显得愚蠢。但他们对他说，他还得再穿一些时候，尽管他们现在先去会合鲁威特，但仍然想让他用那样的装扮在其他动物面前亮亮相。

吃剩下的鸽子肉和兔子肉是不值得带走了，但他们还是带了些饼干。最后提里安把堡垒的门锁上，他们在那里的一段生活就此结束。

他们出发时已是下午两点，那是这一年春天第一个真正暖和的日子。树上的嫩叶似乎比昨天又长宽了一截；雪莲花开败了，但依然能见到报春花。阳光斜斜地射进林子，鸟儿在歌唱，总有潺潺的流水声在耳畔响起（尽管看不见水流）。塔什这一类可怕的事物几乎被他们抛在脑后了，两个孩子甚至在想：“又到了真正的纳尼亚了。”提里安走在队伍的前面，他的心情也好了许多，嘴里甚至还哼起了一首古老的纳尼亚进行曲。这首歌的副歌是这样的：

嗬，战鼓重重地敲，重重地敲，

嘭咚，嘭嘭咚，嘭咚，嘭嘭咚。

走在国王后面的是尤斯塔斯和小矮人波金。波金正在教尤斯塔斯认识纳尼亚的树、鸟和植物；尤斯塔斯有时也将它们在英国的名称告诉他。

他们后面是帕塞尔，再以后是吉尔和珠厄儿，他们俩走得很近。你也许会说，吉尔已经爱上了独角兽。她觉得——她的想法并不错——他是她见过的最漂亮、最敏捷、最优雅的动物。他是那么温和，说话那么轻柔，如果你不了解他，很难想象一到了战场他又是何等的凶猛可怕。

“就这样一路走下去，真是太好了！”吉尔说，“我真希望这样的历险能再多一点儿。只可惜纳尼亚的事情太多了。”

但独角兽向她解释，她的这种说法是不对的。他说，亚当和夏娃的儿女只是在纳尼亚动荡不安的时候才从自己的奇异世界来到这里，但她不应该认为纳尼亚始终如此。他们的几次造访，中间都隔了数百上千年的时间，那时候爱好和平的国王一个接一个更替，你甚至无法记清他们的名字和数量；由于天下太平，史籍中也没有多少记载。独角兽继续提到古代的女王和英雄，那都是吉尔闻所未闻的。他说起白女巫和大严冬以前的白天鹅女王：她长得那么漂亮，只要她朝林间的湖泊张望一下，她的脸留在湖中的倒影就像夜间的星星那样闪耀上三百六十六天！独角兽还说到了神兔蒙伍德，他长着一对顺风耳，即便坐在隆隆作响的大锅湖的瀑布底下，他也能听见远在凯尔帕拉维尔王宫的人们的窃窃私语。他还谈到了盖尔国王，他是第一任国王法朗克的第九代后裔，他曾经远航进入东海，从巨龙的魔掌中解救了孤独岛的百姓，作为回报，他们向他献出整座岛屿，这座岛屿成了纳尼亚国土的一部分。他还谈到了无数个太平盛世，那时候人们能记起的只有盛大的歌舞聚会和比武大会，今天比昨天好，这一周又比上一周好。随着独角兽的讲述，那太平盛世的图景，那数以千计的美妙的图画，都一一聚集于吉尔的脑海，这时候的她就好像站在一座山顶，俯视下面一个无比丰美的平原，那里有一望无际的树林、河流和田野，一直延伸到远方，变得淡薄、模糊。她说：

“啊，我真希望我们能尽快肃清猿猴党徒，回到那美好的正常的时代。我希望这样的日子永远延续。我们的那个世界总有一天要结束，也许这一个不会。噢，珠厄儿，如果纳尼亚永远存在下去——就像你刚才所说的那样，岂不美妙吗？”

“这不可能的，小妹妹，”珠厄儿说，“所有的世界都要完结，只有阿斯兰的国度例外。”

“至少，”吉尔说，“我希望，世界的结束要过千万年、亿万年以后才到来。——喂，你们为什么停下不走了？”

国王、尤斯塔斯和小矮人这时都在抬头张望。吉尔想起他们看见过的那个可怕东西，不由得心头一紧。但这一次不是那个庞然大物。蓝天上飞着的只是一个小黑点。

“我敢打赌，”独角兽说，“从他飞行的姿势看，是一只会说话的鸟。”

“我看也是，”国王说，“但不知他是朋友呢，还是猿猴的奸细。”

“依我看，陛下，”小矮人说，“看他的样子很像千里眼老鹰。”

“我们要不要躲进树林？”尤斯塔斯说。

“不必，”提里安说，“最好站着，像块岩石一动不动。如果动了动身子，他就一定会发现我们了。”

“看！他在盘旋，他已经看见我们了，”珠厄儿说，“他正盘旋着向我们飞来了。”

“搭上箭，姑娘，”提里安对吉尔说，“但没有我的命令，无论如何不要发射。他可能是朋友。”

如果你不在乎接下来发生的事，看见那鸟儿那么优雅自在地向下飞翔，倒也赏心悦目。他在离提里安几英尺的一块岩壁上停下，用他长有冠毛的头鞠了一躬，以老鹰特有的奇怪口吻说：“万福，国王！”

“万福，千里眼，”提里安说，“既然你叫我国王，我相信你一定不是猿猴和他的伪阿斯兰的党徒。你能来我这里，我很高兴。”

“陛下，”老鹰说，“当您听了我带来的消息，您一定会比以往任何时候都伤心。”

听了这句话，提里安的心脏似乎停止了跳动。他咬了咬牙，说：“说下去。”

“我看见了两个场景，”千里眼说，“第一个场景是，凯尔帕拉维尔到处是纳尼亚人的尸体和活着的卡乐门人；提斯罗克的旗帜已经插上王宫的城墙；您的子民纷纷出城，逃到森林里去了。凯尔帕拉维尔王宫是被海上过来的敌人占领的。前天晚上，二十条卡乐门的大船趁着夜色驶进了港口。”

谁都没有说话。

“另一个场景是，在离凯尔帕拉维尔王宫十五英里的地方，人头马鲁威特倒在地上死了，他的腰部还留着一支卡乐门人的箭。他奄奄一息时我就在他身边，他要我把他的话转告陛下：所有的世界都要终结；崇高的死亡是一块珍宝，最穷的人都买得起。”

“这么说，”国王沉默良久，说，“纳尼亚已经不存在了。”





第九章　马厩山大会


他们很长时间没有说话，也没有流泪。最后独角兽用蹄子跺了跺地面，晃了晃鬃毛，开口说：

“陛下，现在也用不着再商量了。我们已经看到，猿猴的诡计比我们想象的要阴险得多。他显然早就跟提斯罗克私下勾结，等到发现狮皮，他便即刻传话给他，让他召集海军夺取凯尔帕拉维尔，侵占整个纳尼亚。我们七位现在能做的只有返回马厩山，宣布事情的真相，进行这一次阿斯兰指派的冒险。如果出现奇迹，打败了跟猿猴在一起的三十个卡乐门人，那时我们就回身再战从凯尔帕拉维尔来的敌军。他们的人数远远超过我们，那时我们也只有捐躯沙场了。”

提里安点了点头。他转身对两个孩子说：“两位朋友，你们就从这里返回自己的世界去吧。你们显然已经做了你们应该做的事。”

“但——但我们什么也没做呀，”吉尔说，她的身子在颤抖，不完全因为害怕，也是因为局势险恶。

“不能这么说，”国王说，“你们解救了我；昨天晚上你又像蛇一样悄然无声地在我前面滑行，牵出了帕塞尔；你，尤斯塔斯，还杀死了一个卡乐门人。但在今天晚上，或者在这两三天中，我们必须面对一场血腥的决战，你们实在太年轻，经受不起的。我因此恳求你们——不，我要命令你们——回到你们的世界。如果让如此年轻的战士为了我捐躯沙场，那我真要惭愧得无地自容了。”

“不，不，不，”吉尔说（她的脸一会儿红，一会儿白），“不管你们怎么说，我们都不回去。不管发生什么事，我们都要跟你在一起。尤斯塔斯，你说呢？”

“是的。对于这件事，根本没有必要提起，”尤斯塔斯说话时将双手插进口袋（这个动作看上去显得怪异，因为他忘记身上穿着锁子甲），“你们知道，我们也别无选择。空谈回去不回去，那有什么好处呢？怎么回去？没有魔法，我们根本就回不去！”

道理是对的，但吉尔仍然觉得尤斯塔斯不应该说这话。当别人情绪激动时，尤斯塔斯其实是就事论事。

提里安也开始意识到两个小客人一时回不了家（除非阿斯兰突然打发他们走），他于是提议他们翻越南部高山，进入相对安全的阿钦兰。但他们并不认识去阿钦兰的路，这里又派不出人来送他们。再说（诚如波金所言），卡乐门人一旦占领纳尼亚，不出一星期一定会去攻占阿钦兰：提斯罗克早就想将这几个北方国家一概纳入自己的版图。最后，在尤斯塔斯和吉尔一再恳求下，提里安答应他们先跟着他碰碰运气——用他的一句更合情理的话说是：“冒一冒阿斯兰指派的风险。”

按国王最初的想法，他们最好等天黑以后再回马厩山（现在一提起这个地名，他们就有恶心之感）。但小矮人对他们说，如果白天到达那里，他们也许会发现马厩山除了一两个哨兵不会有其他的人。由于猿猴（和大黄猫）一直在说新来的阿斯兰（或者塔什兰）在生大家的气，野兽们都害怕得不敢走近这座山了，除非半夜里被召集起来在那里开会。再说，卡乐门人向来不善于林间生活。波金因此觉得大白天反而更容易绕到马厩的背后而不被发现。如果夜幕降临，猿猴开始召集各种动物，所有的卡乐门人戒备森严起来，那时反而很难采取行动。会议开始后，他们可以悄悄地把帕塞尔带到附近，等待动物们要求谒见阿斯兰的那一刻。这显然是个好办法：要把纳尼亚人争取过来，唯一的胜机在于给他们一个大大的意外。

大家都同意这个方案。这个团体于是踏上一条新路——向着西北方向——朝那个可恨的山头走去。老鹰时而在他们头顶盘旋，时而停息在帕塞尔的背上。谁都没想过去骑独角兽——就连国王不到万不得已，也不会去骑如此高贵的动物。

这一次吉尔跟尤斯塔斯走在了一起。刚才恳求国王带上他们时，他们觉得自己很勇敢，但现在又有些胆怯了。

“波尔，”尤斯塔斯小声地说，“跟你说句实话，我现在很紧张。”

“你没事的，斯克罗布，”吉尔说，“你能打仗。但我——实话对你说吧，我已经在发抖了。”

“咳，发抖不要紧的，”尤斯塔斯说，“我感到有点恶心了。”

“看在上帝的分上，别说它了，”吉尔说。

他们在沉默中走了一两分钟。

“波尔，”尤斯塔斯又说了起来。

“什么？”吉尔说。

“如果我们在这里被杀了，那会怎么样啊？”

“那我们就死了，我想。”

“我的意思是，在我们自己那个世界，会怎么样呢？我们会不会苏醒过来，发现自己回到了那列火车上？或者我们就从此消失，人们再也听不到我们的消息？在英格兰，我们是不是也死了呢？”

“我的天，这我倒没有想过。”

“如果彼得和其他人看见我们向窗外招手，但火车进站时又不见我们的人影，他们一定会觉得事情太离奇了！或者他们发现我们两人——我的意思是说，如果我们在英格兰那边死了。”

“呸！”吉尔说，“你的想法真可怕。”

“对我们来说倒并不可怕，”尤斯塔斯说，“我们不会死在那里的。”

“我真希望——噢，不对，我不是那个意思，当然，”吉尔说。

“你打算说什么？”

“我正想说，我希望我们从未来过这里。但我不是这意思，不是，不是。即便我们被杀了，那也是为了纳尼亚而被杀，这比在英格兰一天天变老变蠢，也许还得坐在轮椅里转来转去，最后仍不免一死要好得多。”

“也许我们已经被英国火车撞死了。”

“你这话怎么说？”

“我说，当火车突然震动起来时——当我们被抛进纳尼亚时——我想，当时发生的就是一次交通事故。最后发现我们已经来到这里，这当然是令人喜出望外的。”

当吉尔和尤斯塔斯这样说着话时，其他的人正在讨论行动计划，每人的心情也不那么沉重了。这是因为他们现在满脑子想的是今天晚上要做的事，至于纳尼亚所蒙受的灾难——对她过去的辉煌和幸福的怀念——都暂时被抛在脑后。一旦停止交谈，这种思想又会冒出，让他们再度陷入悲伤之中；好在他们都在不停地说话。波金对于晚上的行为甚至十分乐观：他确信野猪和熊，可能还有所有的狗，都会立刻站到他们这一边来。波金相信并非所有的小矮人都会支持格里佛尔。在篝火旁作战，出没于丛林中，也将更有利于弱势的一方。如果今晚取胜了，而后的几天难道他们非得迎战卡乐门的主力军，让自己去送死吗？

他们为什么不可以躲进丛林，或者进入大瀑布那边的西部荒野，像亡命之徒那样继续战斗呢？那时，会说话的野兽和阿钦兰的人都会来投奔他们，他们的力量必然会一天天壮大起来。最后他们就可以走出丛林，将疏于防范的卡乐门人一扫而光，纳尼亚王国便可复兴了。这样的事在弥勒兹国王时代就发生过！

提里安听着大家说话，心里在想：“那塔什会有什么举动呢？”在他的内心深处，总觉得这样的好事是不会发生的。但这话他没有说出口。

当快到马厩山时，大家都安静了下来。真正的林中冒险开始了。从看见马厩山那一刻起，到最后到达马厩的背后，一共花了他们两个多小时。这个过程是很难细述的，除非你不惜篇幅记起流水账。从这个隐蔽处到另一个隐蔽处，这中间的旅程就是一段不同的冒险，有时是长时间的等待，还有一次次的虚惊。如果你是一个优秀的侦察兵，或者是一个好向导，你一定知道其中的艰辛。太阳快下山时，他们终于安全地进入一片冬青丛中，那里离马厩背后只有十五英尺的距离。大家吃了些饼干，就地躺了下来。

此后的等待是难耐的。幸好两个孩子睡着了一两个小时，当然，当他们醒过来时，天有些凉了；更糟糕的是，他们感到口渴，但没有解渴的水。帕塞尔站在那里，没有说一句话，他的身子因紧张而微微颤抖。提里安把头枕在珠厄儿的肚子上睡得很香，好像这里就是凯尔帕拉维尔王宫的御床，直到一阵锣声将他唤醒。他坐了起来，看见马厩那边已经有了火光，他知道决战的时刻到了。

“吻吻我吧，珠厄儿，”他说，“今天晚上必定是我们在这个世界最后的一晚了。如果我在大大小小的各种事务中曾经冒犯过你，请你宽恕我吧。”

“亲爱的国王，”独角兽说，“我真希望你曾经冒犯过我，这样我就可以宽恕你了。再见吧。我们已经在一起度过许多快乐的日子。如果阿斯兰允许我选择，我会选择来世继续这样生活，继续这样去牺牲。”

他们随后唤醒了千里眼（他睡觉时把头埋进翅膀，看上去就好像是无头的），朝着马厩匍匐而行。他们把帕塞尔留在马厩背后（大家都好言安慰他，因为谁也不再生他的气），告诉他不要随便走动，要一直等到有人来牵他。他们自己则在马厩旁边的一个地方隐藏起来。

篝火刚点燃不久，正开始旺旺地燃烧。篝火离他们只有几英尺远，纳尼亚的动物们就聚集在篝火的那一边，因此，提里安一开始看不清他们：借着火光的反射，他能看见的只是那一双双的眼睛，就像你借着汽车前灯的亮光看见兔子和猫的眼睛那样。提里安刚站好位置，锣声就停了，从他左侧的某个地方出现了三个人影：一个是卡乐门人的头领利什达王爷；第二个是猿猴，他用爪子抓住王爷的手，嘴里一个劲地咕哝着，抱怨着，“别走太快，别走太快，我身体不好。哟，我可怜的头！这些午夜大会真让我挺不住了。我们猿猴晚上都不活动的。我们猿猴比不得老鼠和蝙蝠——哎呀，我可怜的头。”

猿猴的一侧是大黄猫，他的尾巴在空中高高竖起，脚步既轻盈又庄重。他们径直走向篝火；距离提里安很近，如果他们朝右侧张望一下，就一定能发现他们。幸运的是他们没有这样做。提里安听见利什达低声对大黄猫说：

“猫兄弟，到你的岗位上去吧。一定要扮演好你的角色。”

“喵，喵。放心吧！”大黄猫应了一声，随即绕过篝火，在聚集的动物的前排坐下；你可以说，他是观众中的一员了。

真的，随着事情的发展，整个过程越来越像一部戏剧了。纳尼亚的动物们就像观众席坐着的观众；马厩前那片草坪，即篝火燃烧的地方，就像舞台；猿猴和卡乐门人的头领站在台上跟观众说话；马厩本身就像舞台的布景；提里安和他的朋友就像在布景背后偷看演出的观众。他们的位置是很特殊的：如果他们中有人向前迈几步走到火光底下，所有的眼睛即刻会注视到他的身上。但从另一方面说，只要他们始终站在马厩背后的阴影中不动，他们不被人发现也是有百分之九十九的保证的。

利什达王爷拉着猿猴来到篝火跟前，面对着观众；他们的后背不用说就朝着提里安和他的朋友们了。

“猴子兄弟，”利什达王爷轻声对猿猴说，“运用你聪明的头脑，说几句话吧。把头抬起来。”说话间他还用脚戳了他一下（或者说踢了他一下）。

“放开我，”雪夫特咕哝着说。随后他挺直腰杆，扯大嗓门说：

“诸位！你们听着，一件可怕的事发生了。一件邪恶的事，一件在纳尼亚闻所未闻的最邪恶的事。阿斯兰——”

“塔什兰，傻瓜！”利什达王爷低声纠正它。

“当然，我是说塔什兰，”猿猴说，“为了这件事，已经大发雷霆了。”

一片可怕的沉默。众动物在凝神谛听，想知道又有什么新的灾难降临在他们身上。马厩背后的那一班也屏住了呼吸。猿猴到底在玩什么把戏呢？

“是的，”猿猴说，“就在此时，当可怕的大神来到我们中间——进入我身后的马厩时——有那么一头可恶的畜生，居然冒天下之大不韪，做了一件让你们想都不敢想的事。他用狮子皮把自己打扮起来，在这里的树林里走来走去，冒充阿斯兰。”

一时间，吉尔怀疑猿猴是不是疯了。他这不是在揭露事情的真相吗？动物们爆发出一阵恐惧而愤怒的吼叫。“呜呜！他是谁？他在哪里？让我咬死他！”

“昨天晚上还看见他的，”猿猴尖叫着说，“但他逃走了。他就是驴！一头普普通通、可怜巴巴的驴！如果有谁看见这头驴——”

“呜呜！”动物们在都吼叫，“我们会的，我们会咬死他的。必须把他清理出我们的队伍。”

吉尔看了看国王。提里安嘴巴张得大大的，脸上显露出恐惧。她明白：这是敌人该死的诡计。谎言中掺和一点儿事实，他们就使谎言变强大了。现在再向动物们说有一头披着狮皮的驴在欺骗他们，还能有什么好处呢？猿猴会说：“这话是我刚才说过的。”让帕塞尔穿着狮子皮示众，结果会怎么样？他们一定会把他撕成碎片！

“他们这是釜底抽薪啊，”尤斯塔斯自言自语地说。

“我们的立足之地被挖了，”提里安国王说。

“该诅咒的奸计！”波金说，“我敢打赌，这新的谎言一定是大黄猫编造的。”





第十章　谁敢进入马厩？


吉尔感到她的耳根有点痒，原来独角兽珠厄儿正用他的嘴对着她小声说话。她听了后即刻点了点头，踮着脚来到帕塞尔站立的地方。不一会儿，她已悄悄地割断最后一根绳子，解除了缚在他身上的狮子皮。既然猿猴说了那样的话，就决不可以让帕塞尔穿着狮子皮被捉了！她想把狮子皮拖到很远的地方藏起来，但它实在太重。她能做到的只是把它踢进灌木丛。然后她向帕塞尔招招手，让他跟上她；他俩一起回到同伴那里。

猿猴还在继续发表演说。

“发生了这件可怕的事以后，阿斯兰——塔什兰——显然更生气了。他说，他对大家太仁慈了，每天晚上都出来跟你们见面。好了，他现在再也不愿出来了。”

动物们发出一阵呜呜嚎嚎的抱怨声。一个与众不同的声音突然哈哈大笑着说：

“听这猴子说些什么呀！”那声音高叫着，“他为什么不把高贵的阿斯兰带出来，原因是很清楚的。我来告诉你们吧：因为根本就没有阿斯兰。除了一头背上披着狮皮的老驴，什么也没有。现在这头老驴也弄丢了，他不知道怎么办好了。”

提里安未能清楚地看到篝火对面的那些动物的脸，但他猜想，说话者应该是小矮人的头目格里佛尔。他的猜想得到了证实。所有的小矮人随即都在唱和：“不知道怎么办好了！不知道怎么办好了！不知道怎么办好了！”

“安静！”利什达王爷吼叫起来，“安静，泥土的子孙们！听我说，你们这班纳尼亚的另类！否则我就下令我的勇士用弯刀劈了你们。雪夫特大人已经把驴子的罪行告诉了你们。你们以为有了这头驴，马厩里就没有真正的塔什兰了吗？你们真的是这样想的吗？留神点吧，留神点吧！”

“没有，没有！”动物们嚷嚷着。小矮人讥笑着说：“不错，黑鬼，你说对了。来吧，猴子，让我们看看马厩，眼见为实。”

沉默了片刻后，猿猴说：“你们小矮人觉得自己很聪明，是不是？别急，我并没有说你们不可以见塔什兰。谁想见都可以见他。”

所有的动物都安静了下来。大约一分钟后，熊以困惑的口吻慢吞吞地说：“我还不完全理解。”接着他咕哝着说：“我想你自己说的——”

“你想！”猿猴重复着熊的声音，“好像任何人都可以把你脑子里的活动叫作‘想’。听好了，你们大家。任何人都可以见塔什兰。但他不会主动出来。你们得自己进去见他。”

“谢谢你，谢谢你，谢谢你，”动物们七嘴八舌地说，“这正是我们的想法！我们就是想进去面对面见见他。只要他是仁慈的，一切都恢复正常了。”鸟儿喳喳叫着，狗儿激动地吠叫着。紧接着便是一阵骚动，动物们都乱哄哄地站了起来，大家争先恐后往前挤，都想涌进马厩的门。

猿猴厉声吆喝：“回去！安静！先别急。”

动物们停下脚步，有的把爪子举在空中，有的摇晃着尾巴。所有的眼睛都盯着猿猴。

“我想，你自己说过的——”熊刚开口，雪夫特便打断了他。

“大家都可以进去，”猿猴说，“但一次只能进一个。谁先来？他自己说过，他并不那么仁慈。自从前天晚上吞下了那位邪恶的国王，他现在正在舔自己的嘴巴呢。今天早上他一直在大吼大叫。今天晚上连我自己也不想进马厩。你们可以请便。谁愿意第一个进去？如果他一口把你吞下，或者用他恐怖的眼睛把你烧成灰烬，可不要怪我啊。那是你自己的事。现在，请吧！谁先进去？你们小矮人先进去一个吧？”

“壮士，壮士，进来受死！”格里佛尔嘲笑说，“我们怎么知道你在里面搞了什么名堂呢？”

“呵呵！”猿猴高声说，“这么说你们开始感到里面有东西了，是不是？刚才你们还闹哄哄地吵着要进去。什么东西让你们变成哑巴了？谁先进去？”

所有的动物都站在那里面面相觑，并开始向后退。摇晃的尾巴几乎都不见了。猿猴一摇一摆地走来走去，嘲笑着他们。“呵呵呵！”他窃笑着，“我原以为你们迫不及待想见见塔什兰呢！改变主意了，是不是？”

吉尔想跟提里安悄悄地说句话，国王于是朝她低下头去。

“你觉得马厩里到底有什么东西呀？”她说。

“谁知道呢？”提里安说，“两个卡乐门人手握弯刀守卫在门口两侧，倒也煞有介事。”

“你有没有想过，”吉尔说，“那会不会是……你知道……我们看见过的那个可怕的东西？”

“你是说塔什吗？”提里安轻声说，“这就不好说了。但勇敢点，孩子，真正的阿斯兰永远保护着我们。”

这时候，意外的事发生了。大黄猫开口了，他的声音十分冷静、清晰，他的神态镇静自若：“如果你允许，我进去吧。”

所有的动物都转过身来，注视着大黄猫。

“留意他们的花招，陛下，”波金对国王说，“这只该死的猫是参与这项阴谋的，而且是重要角色。我敢肯定，不管马厩里有什么东西，都伤不着他。大黄猫进去后出来，一定会说他看见了什么奇迹。”

提里安没来得及回答波金，猿猴已在招呼大黄猫，让他走上前来。

“呵呵！”猿猴说，“一只冒失的猫咪，这么说你是要见见他了。那好，过来吧！我为你开门。如果他把你的胡子吓得掉下来，可别怪我。那是你自己的事。”

大黄猫站了起来，离开身边的动物，他的脚步沉稳而优雅，尾巴翘在空中，柔软的皮袄上的每一根毛发都梳理得整齐有致。他就那样走上前去，绕过篝火，来到离提里安很近的地方；提里安背靠着马厩的一角站着，能够直接看到他的脸。他那双碧绿的大眼睛一眨也不眨（“真冷静啊，”尤斯塔斯心里想，“他知道他是用不着害怕的。”）。

猿猴暗自笑着，扮了个鬼脸，蹒跚地走到大黄猫前面，抬起爪子，拉开门闩，打开了马厩的门。提里安期待着：当他走进黑暗的过道时，一定会喵喵地叫起来的。

“哎依——哎依——噢威！”一声最可怕的哀嚎声使在场所有的动物都吓了一跳。在夜深人静的夜晚，你一定被猫儿在屋顶上争吵或做爱的声音惊醒过。现在的声音就是这样子。

更糟的还在后面。大黄猫飞也似的从马厩里逃出来，首先将猿猴撞了个四脚朝天。如果你不知道他是一只猫，一定会当他是一道黄色的闪电。他窜过开阔的草地，回到动物中间。没有任何动物会在这时候上前迎接他。所有的动物都纷纷给他让道。他跳到一棵树上，急转身子，把脑袋朝着地面。他的尾巴倒竖起来，几乎与身体一般粗细。眼睛像一对闪着绿光的碟子；背上的毛发一根根挺起。

“我宁愿拔光我的胡子，”波金喃喃地说，“只要我能弄清这只畜生到底是在演戏呢，还是真的被里面的东西吓坏了！”

“静一静，朋友，”提里安说，因为那个卡乐门头领这时正在跟猿猴悄悄说话，他想听听他们在说什么。他只听到猿猴又在抱怨“我的头啊，我的头”，其他的话没能听清；但他能感觉到，他们也跟他一样对大黄猫的举动大惑不解。

“黄猫，”卡乐门头领说，“别闹了！告诉我们你看到了什么。”

“哎依——哎依——噢威！”大黄猫又哀叫起来。

“你不是一只会说话的野兽吗？”头领说，“别鬼哭狼嚎似的怪叫了，说吧。”

随后的情形是可怕的。提里安确信（其他人都有同感），大黄猫竭力想说什么，就是什么也说不出，嘴里只能发出普通的猫的哀嚎声，那是你在英格兰的庭院里就能从一只受了惊吓的猫那里听到的。他哀叫得越久，越不像一只会说话的动物了。动物群中随即响起一阵不安的喧哗和低声的尖叫。

“看，看！”熊开口说，“他不会说话了。他忘记怎么说话了。他又成了一只哑巴野兽了。看看他的脸。”

所有的动物都看到了这个事实。巨大的恐惧笼罩在这些纳尼亚生灵的心头。所有的动物在他们还是小鸡小狗小狐的时候就接受过这样的教育：阿斯兰开创世界的当初就让纳尼亚的动物都能张口说话，但他同时警告过，一旦哪一天他们变坏了，他们就会恢复原形，跟你在其他国家见到的那些愚蠢的动物没有两样。

“这话开始应验了，”他们悲叹着。

“发发慈悲，发发慈悲吧！”野兽们哭叫起来，“饶恕我们吧。雪夫特大人，请你为我们调停，为我们向阿斯兰说说好话。我们不敢了，我们不敢了。”

大黄猫已经消失在丛林深处。从此没有人再见过他。

提里安低着头站在那里，手按在剑柄上。他已被这恐怖的一幕弄得头脑发晕。他几次想抽出宝剑，扑向卡乐门人；但同时又觉得不妨再等等，看看事态有没有转机。转机果然出现了。

“我的父亲，”一个清脆的声音从左侧的群体中响起。提里安知道说话的是一个卡乐门人：因为在提斯罗克的军队里，普通的士兵称呼上级为“我的主人”，下级军官称呼上级军官为“我的父亲”。吉尔和尤斯塔斯不知道这种规矩，两人左右看了看，终于见到了说话的人：因为你位于篝火边上反而比位于中间更能看清东西，透过火光看前面的景物，前面好像总是漆黑一团。此人年纪轻轻，身材又高又瘦，虽像黑肤的卡乐门人惯有的那样高傲，但不失英俊潇洒。

“我的父亲，”他对他的头领利什达王爷说，“我也想进去。”

“别说了，伊默斯，”头领说，“谁叫你了？这里是适合一个孩子说话的地方吗？”

“我的父亲，”伊默斯说，“我比你年轻，这不假，但我身上跟你一样流着王族的血，我也是塔什的仆人。因此——”

“闭嘴，”利什达王爷说，“我不是你的头领吗？你跟这马厩没有任何关系。这是为纳尼亚人准备的。”

“不，我的父亲，”伊默斯说，“你自己说过，他们的阿斯兰跟我们的塔什是一体的。如果这话是对的，塔什神就应该在里面。你怎么可以说我跟他没有关系呢？只要能见一面塔什大神，让我死一千次也心甘情愿。”

“你是个傻瓜，什么也不懂，”利什达王爷说，“这都是高深的学问。”

伊默斯的脸变得更严肃了。“这么说，塔什和阿斯兰合二为一的话不是真的了？”他问，“猿猴对我们撒了谎吗？”

“他们当然是合二为一的，”猿猴说。

“发个誓吧，猴子，”伊默斯说。

“哦，我的天！”雪夫特咕哝着说，“我希望你不要再烦我了。我头疼得厉害。行了，行了，我发誓吧。”

“好了，我的父亲，”伊默斯说，“我已下定决心，非进去不可。”

“傻瓜，”利什达王爷还打算阻止他，小矮人们已齐声呼喊起来，“快点啊，黑鬼。为什么不让他进去啊？为什么只让纳尼亚人进去，让你们自己的国民留在外面呢？里面究竟有什么东西，不可以让你们自己的人见识见识呢？”

利什达王爷耸了耸肩膀。提里安和他的朋友只看得见他的后背，因此无法知道他此时的面部表情。他们听他在说：“大家为我见证，如果这个小傻瓜流了血，我是无辜的。进去吧，鲁莽的孩子，快点！”

一如大黄猫所做的那样，伊默斯踏入篝火与马厩之间的那片草地。他的眼睛炯炯有神，他的脸庄严肃穆，他的手按在剑柄上，他的头高高昂起。吉尔看见了他的脸，真想大哭一场；珠厄儿小声地对国王说：“狮王的鬃毛为我做证，尽管他是个卡乐门人，我几乎爱上他了。他本该信仰一个更好的神的。”

“我真想早点儿知道里面究竟有什么东西，”尤斯塔斯说。

伊默斯打开马厩，踏进黑魆魆的入口，随即关上身后的门。只过了片刻——只是时间显得有点长——马厩的门重新打开了。一个身穿卡乐门盔甲的人影在门口晃了晃，仰天倒出门外，躺在地上不动了。马厩的门又关上了。卡乐门头领奔过去，蹲下身子看那人的脸，显得十分吃惊。过了好一会儿，他振作起来，对着大家大声说：

“这个鲁莽的孩子实现自己的愿望了。他看到了塔什神，现在死了。你们引以为戒吧。”

“引以为戒，引以为戒，”可怜的动物们应和着。提里安和他的朋友看了看卡乐门人的尸体，然后又相互看了看他们自己。由于离尸体很近，他们能看到隔着篝火的禽兽们看不到的一切：这个死者并不是伊默斯。他的相貌完全不同，年纪比伊默斯大，身体比伊默斯胖，但没有伊默斯高，而且还蓄了一部大胡子。

“呵呵呵，”猿猴嘲笑着，“还有谁啊？还有谁想进去啊？好了，既然你们都这么腼腆，我就点名了。你，野猪！你过来。卡乐门兄弟，把他押过来。他应该去见见塔什兰。”

“呣——呣，”野猪哼哼着，挺起沉重的身子，“那好，来吧，试试我的牙齿。”

提里安看见勇敢的野猪做好了殊死一搏的准备，几个卡乐门士兵提着弯刀向他靠近，野猪身边并没有动物出来救助他，提里安的心里好像有什么东西要爆炸了。此时出手干预是否合适，已不在他的考虑之中。

“拔出宝剑，”他低声对他的朋友们说，“箭上弦！跟上我！”

吃惊的纳尼亚众生灵随后便看见七个黑影子跳到了马厩前面，其中四人身穿闪亮的盔甲。国王把宝剑举过头顶挥舞着，剑刃在火光中闪耀着，他那洪亮的声音在厉声高叫：

“纳尼亚的提里安在此！我凭阿斯兰的名义，用我的性命证明：塔什是一个邪恶的魔鬼，猿猴是一个十足的叛徒，这些卡乐门人全都该死。所有诚实的纳尼亚子民，都站到我一边来！难道你们甘愿等待下去，让你们的新主子把你们一个个杀死吗？”





第十一章　步伐加快了


利什达王爷闪电般迅速跳开，躲过了国王的宝剑。他并不是胆小鬼，如有必要，他敢单独挑战提里安和小矮人。但他招架不住老鹰和独角兽的攻击。他知道，老鹰会飞到你的脸上，啄你的眼珠子，用翅膀挡住你的视线。他听他的父亲说过（他曾经在战场上跟纳尼亚人交战过），除了用箭和长矛，任何人都抵抗不住独角兽：当他向你攻击时，他会竖起后腿直立起来，这时你得同时应付他的蹄、角和牙齿。他于是逃进那群动物中，向他们高声呼叫：

“到我这边来，到我这边来，提斯罗克的勇士们（愿提斯罗克万寿无疆）！所有纳尼亚忠诚的子民，到我这边来，以免塔什兰的愤怒降临你们身上！”

与此同时，还发生了另外两件事。猿猴没有像利什达那样反应敏捷，迅速意识到眼前的危险。他依然蹲在篝火旁，还盯着提里安他们看了一两秒钟。提里安这时已经冲到这个恶徒跟前，抓住他的脖子将他拎起，拖到马厩前高呼：“把门打开！”波金开了马厩的门。“进去吧，雪夫特！去喝你自己酿制的药去吧。”提里安边说边将猿猴抛进黑暗之中。随着小矮人砰的一声关上马厩的门，一道令人目眩的深蓝色的光从马厩里直射出来，大地颤抖了，随后便响起一种奇怪的声音——好像是某种怪鸟的粗哑的尖叫。

动物们都哀鸣起来，他们呼喊着：“塔什兰，救救我们吧！”许多动物匍匐在地，有的用翅膀或爪子遮住自己的脸。这时候，只有视力优于群兽的千里眼注意到了利什达王爷的脸。从他亲眼所见的情形来判断，他能断定利什达也像其他人一样惊讶，甚至近乎惶恐。

“这一个走了，”千里眼心里说，“他不信神却偏要召唤神。如果神真的来了，那他又会怎么样呢？”

同时发生的第三件事是那天晚上唯一一件大好事。聚会中所有会说话的狗（共十五只）都欢快地吠叫着，一蹦一跳地来到国王这边。他们大多体形硕大，肩膀宽阔，上下颚结结实实。他们就像海滩上的巨浪呼啸而来，那一股气势就能把你击倒。尽管他们是会说话的狗，但都具有狗的顽皮：他们凭后爪立起，把前爪搭在人的肩膀上，舔着他们的脸，一个劲地嚷嚷：“欢迎！欢迎！我们一定帮忙，一定帮忙，帮忙，帮忙！告诉我们怎样帮忙，怎样帮忙！怎样——怎样——怎样？”

那场面真够感人，使你想要哭了。这毕竟是他们一直所盼望的事。一会儿以后，几只小动物（田鼠、鼹鼠和松鼠）也啪嗒啪嗒地过来了，他们高兴地尖叫着说：“看，看，我们来了。”这以后，熊和野猪也来了；尤斯塔斯觉得，一切都将走向正常了。但提里安看了看四周，总觉得来投奔的动物太少了。

“到我这边来，到我这边来！”他呼喊着，“我是你们的国王，难道你们都成了懦夫了吗？”

“我们不敢，”十来个声音带着哭腔说，“塔什兰会生气的。为我们挡一挡塔什兰吧。”

“那些会说话的马呢？”提里安问野猪。

“我们见到过，我们见到过，”老鼠说，“猿猴让他们做工。他们都被绑着——就在这里的山脚下。”

“你们这些小家伙，”提里安说，“你们这班能啃能咬、能将硬果弄碎的小伙计，以你们最快的速度跳下山去，看看那些马是否站在我们一边。如果是，就用你们的牙齿咬断他们身上的绳子，把他们带到这里来。”

“遵命，陛下，”尖细的声音回应着，这班目光锐利、牙齿尖利的子民随即扬起尾巴出发了。提里安看着他们远去，慈爱地笑了笑。现在该是考虑其他的事情的时候了。利什达王爷已经在颁布他的命令。

“前进！”王爷高呼，“尽可能把他们全部活捉，丢进马厩，或者赶进马厩去。等他们到齐了，我们就给马厩放一把火，让他们成为塔什大神的祭品。”

“哈！”千里眼自言自语地说，“这个不信神的家伙，他是想拿我们换取塔什的宽恕呢。”

敌人的阵线——利什达的人马占了一半——已经开始向前移动，提里安差点儿没时间发布他的命令了。

“吉尔，你到左边去，在他们接近我们以前把箭射出去。野猪和熊跟在她后面。波金在我的左侧，尤斯塔斯在我的右侧。珠厄儿守住右翼。帕塞尔到珠厄儿身边去，用你的蹄子作战。千里眼从空中攻击。你们这些狗儿，都跟上我。刀剑的搏杀一开始，你们就冲向敌阵。阿斯兰保佑我们！”

尤斯塔斯站在那里，心跳得厉害，一个劲地祈祷自己变勇敢起来。眼前的景象使他的血液变凝固了；虽然以前他见过一条龙和一条海蛇，但这样一大队皮肤发黑眼睛发亮的人，倒是头一回见到。敌方共有十五个卡乐门人，一头会说话的纳尼亚公牛，还有狐狸斯林基、林怪拉格尔。这时，他听见左边响起嗖的一声，一个卡乐门人应声倒下了，接着又是嗖的一声，林怪也倒下了。“射得好，孩子！”提里安大声喝彩。但敌人也已经扑到他们跟前。

尤斯塔斯记不得之后的两分钟发生了什么事。这场战斗就像一场梦（当你发高烧时做的那种梦），直到他听见利什达王爷在远处呼叫：

“撤！退到这边来，重整旗鼓！”

尤斯塔斯恢复了神志，看见卡乐门人惊慌失措地向他的朋友们跑回去，但并非都跑回去了：两个卡乐门人倒地死了，他们是被独角兽戳死的；提里安也用剑杀了一个。狐狸倒毙在他的脚下，国王自己也弄不清这狐狸是不是他杀的。公牛也倒下了，他先被吉尔用箭射穿了眼睛，然后又被野猪用獠牙刺穿了腹部。我们这边也有损失：三只狗被杀了，第四只伤了一条腿，一瘸一瘸地走在队伍后面。熊倒在地上，无力地动弹了一下，嘶哑的喉咙里发出喃喃的声音，“我——我不——不明白——”话没说完，他已在草地上垂下那颗大脑袋，像孩子一样安静地睡了过去，从此再没动弹。

敌人的第一次进攻确实失败了，但尤斯塔斯似乎高兴不起来：他非常口渴，胳膊也在发痛。

打了败仗的卡乐门人回到他们的指挥官身边。小矮人开始嘲笑他们：

“打够了吧，黑鬼？”他们嚷嚷着，“好不好玩啊？你们那位伟大的王爷自己为什么不上去拼杀，偏要让你们上去送死？可怜的黑鬼哟。”

“小矮人们！”提里安冲着他们喊话，“到这儿来，用你们的剑，别用你们的嘴。时间还来得及。纳尼亚的小矮人们，你们英勇善战，这我是知道的。回来忠于你们的国家吧。”

“呀！”小矮人在嘲笑，“这好像不可能。你们跟那班人一样，也是大骗子。我们不需要什么国王。小矮人站在小矮人的立场上。呸！”

随后鼓声响了：这次不是小矮人的鼓，而是卡乐门人的牛皮大鼓。两个孩子一开始就不喜欢这声音。“嘭——嘭——吧吧——嘭”，鼓继续响着。如果他们懂得鼓声的含义，一定会更加讨厌它。提里安是懂得的：鼓声意味着另有一支卡乐门军队就在附近，它是利什达王爷招来的援兵。提里安和珠厄儿忧心忡忡地看了看对方。他们原先还指望能打赢晚上这一仗，如今敌人的援兵一来，希望就成泡影了。

提里安失望地看了看四周，发现卡乐门的阵营里有几个纳尼亚子民，他们的倒戈不知是因为背信弃义还是出于对塔什兰的真心恐惧。更多纳尼亚子民只是静静地坐着，观望着，并不打算加入任何一方。站在他这边的动物为数有限；这个群体还越来越小。显而易见，他们中有一部分已经临阵脱逃。

“嘭——嘭——吧吧——嘭”，可怕的鼓声在继续。这时，另一个声音忽然掺和进来。“听！”珠厄儿说。随即千里眼又叫了起来，“看！”一会儿以后，真相大白：随着一阵雷鸣般的蹄声，二十多匹会说话的纳尼亚马摇晃着脑袋，张开着鼻孔，抖动着鬃毛，正朝马厩山奔驰而来。这都是田鼠、鼹鼠和松鼠们的功劳。

小矮人波金和两个孩子张开嘴巴正要欢呼，但话还没出口，空中已充斥了拉弓的嘣嘣声和箭矢飞行的嗖嗖声。射箭的是小矮人——吉尔一时间还不敢相信自己的眼睛——他们正在射击那群马。小矮人都是致命的射手。马儿一匹接一匹倒下。这些高贵的动物没一匹安全来到国王身边。

“小猪猡！”尤斯塔斯愤怒得双脚直跳，破口大骂，“肮脏的、龌龊的、背信弃义的小畜生！”

珠厄儿甚至说：“陛下，要不要我向这班小矮人冲过去，用我的角一下顶死他们十个八个？”

提里安铁青着脸说：“站着别动，珠厄儿。小宝贝（这是对吉尔说的），如果你想哭，就转过身去哭吧，千万别弄湿了弓弦。尤斯塔斯，安静。别像洗碗姑娘似的骂人。战士是不骂人的。礼貌和重击是他唯一的语言。”

小矮人对尤斯塔斯反唇相讥：“你感到很奇怪吧，小孩？你觉得我们应该站在你那边，是不是？别害怕。我们不需要任何会说话的马。我们不想让你们变得比另一伙更强大。我们不会上你们的当。小矮人站在小矮人的立场上。”

利什达王爷还在向他的士兵训话，显然是在安排下一轮的进攻，他也许还在后悔，怪自己在第一轮进攻中没有投入全部军力。战鼓敲响了。让提里安和他的朋友感到惊恐的是，他们还听见远处隐隐约约传来应和的鼓声。另一支卡乐门军队听见利什达发出的信号，也来增援他了。提里安已经放弃一切希望，但从他的脸上你并不能看出这一点。

“大家听好，”他就事论事地低声说，“我们必须抢在那班异教徒获得增援以前发动进攻。”

“请陛下三思，”波金说，“我们在这里，背后有马厩坚固的挡板掩护。如果发起冲锋，就会被他们团团围住，四面受敌。”

“小矮人，如果敌人的计划原本不是想把我们逼进马厩，”提里安说，“那我一定同意你的说法。这个该死的门，我们离得越远越好。”

“国王说得对，”千里眼说，“先别管里面有什么样的妖怪，我们无论如何得先撤离这该死的马厩。”

“不错，我们动身吧，”尤斯塔斯说，“这个鬼地方我是连看也不想看了。”

“那好，”提里安说，“请注意我们的左边。你们看见一块大岩石了吧，在火光下，它白晃晃的，就像一块大理石。我们先向那班卡乐门人冲杀过去。姑娘，你动身到我们的左侧去，尽快把箭射向他们的阵中。老鹰，你从右边飞过去，啄他们的脸。我和其他的人向他们冲锋。当我们短兵相接时，吉尔，为了防止误伤自己人，你得停止射击，赶紧回到白岩石那边等我们。作战时大家务必注意我的号令。我们必须几分钟内打退他们，否则就没有取胜的可能，因为我们人数实在太少。一旦我下令撤退，大家赶紧退回到吉尔那里。凭借白岩石的掩护，我们可以在那里喘喘气。好了，出发吧，吉尔。”

吉尔跑了出去，离开大家大约二十英尺的距离，心里感到极其孤独。她迈开脚步，右脚在后，左脚在前，将箭搭上弦，一边祈祷自己的手不要抖得太厉害。

“这一箭射得真臭！”她射出的第一支箭从敌人头顶飞了过去，不由得自责了一声。随后她搭上第二支箭；提醒自己要掌握好速度。她看见一只又大又黑的鸟儿扑向卡乐门人的脸，那是千里眼。卡乐门士兵一个个丢下手中的弯刀，举起双手保护自己的眼睛。吉尔的箭射中了其中一人，另一支箭射中了一只投敌变节的纳尼亚狼。

她只射了几秒钟后就不得不停了下来。提里安此时已率领他的伙伴以百米冲刺的速度扑向敌人，顿时一片刀光剑影，野猪咧开獠牙，珠厄儿挺起独角，狗吠声震天动地。吉尔惊奇地发现卡乐门人全都乱了阵脚。她没有意识到这是她和老鹰的功劳。卡乐门人一边得防范她射出的箭，一边得提防老鹰的攻击，他们的眼睛就无睱关注来自正面的进攻了。

“打得好！打得好！”吉尔高叫着。国王的人马已经将敌人的阵线前后切断。独角兽用角挑起卡乐门人，就像农夫用干草叉挑干草。在吉尔看来，即便尤斯塔斯也打得很漂亮（他毕竟剑术不精）。狗儿们专咬卡乐门人的喉咙。战斗进行得很顺利！胜利在望了——

但吉尔注意到了一个奇怪的事实，这让她不寒而栗。尽管纳尼亚人每一次出手都有卡乐门人倒在地上，但卡乐门人的数量似乎并没有少下去。事实上，他们的人数比战斗刚开始时还多。每一秒钟都在增加！他们从四面八方涌来。新来的是卡乐门人的援兵。他们每人手上都提着长矛。他们的人数那么多，吉尔几乎看不见她的朋友了。

这时，她听见提里安在呼喊：

“快撤！到岩石那边去！”

敌人的援兵全部赶到了。这时鼓声也停了。





第十二章　穿过马厩门


吉尔本该早就回到白岩石那边，但由于观战时过于激动，她已把提里安对她的指令完全抛在脑后。现在她记起来了，便赶紧转身回跑，到达白岩石时也仅比其他人早到了一两秒钟。撤退的一瞬间他们是背向敌人的，到达后便赶紧转身回头。眼前的情形非常糟糕。

一个卡乐门人正奔向马厩的门，胳膊下夹着什么人，只见他又是踢脚又是挣扎。当卡乐门人到达篝火边时，他们看清了卡乐门人的脸，也看清了被他夹着的那个人就是尤斯塔斯。

提里安和独角兽赶紧冲出去营救。但卡乐门人离马厩比他们近得多；他们才冲出一半的距离，那人已将尤斯塔斯丢进马厩，并将门关上。六七个卡乐门人跑在那人的后面；他们在马厩前的空地上摆开阵势。这时要想靠近马厩已经不可能了。

吉尔这时仍不忘把她的脸扭过一边，以便避开手上的弓。“即便我不能停止哭泣，也决不让泪水弄湿我的弓弦，”她对自己说。

“留神！箭！”波金突然叫了起来。

大家赶紧拉下头盔挡住自己的脸。狗儿们都蹲了下来。虽然有几支箭朝他们所在的地方飞来，但事情很快明朗了：他们并不是射击的目标。格里佛尔率领小矮人又在射击。这一次是朝卡乐门人放箭。

“孩子们，拿出勇气来！”听得出是格里佛尔的声音，“大家一起努力，保护好自己。我们不需要猴子、狮子和国王，我们同样也不需要黑鬼。小矮人站在小矮人的立场上。”

不管你如何评判小矮人，但谁也不能说他们不勇敢。他们完全可以离开这里，去一个安全的地方；但他们宁愿留下来，就想尽可能多地杀伤交战的双方，除非交战双方通过厮杀一同消失，用不着小矮人再动手。他们需要一个属于自己的纳尼亚。

小矮人们考虑不周的是，卡乐门人身上穿着盔甲，不像前番的马儿那样对箭毫不设防。卡乐门人还有统一的指挥。利什达王爷这时就在高呼：

“你们三十个给我盯住白岩石那边的傻瓜。其余的跟上我，我们要好好教训一下这班泥土的子孙。”

提里安和他的朋友们经过激烈的战斗，依然喘息未定，巴不得有几分钟的休息时间。当王爷率领他的人马去打小矮人时，他们就站着观看。篝火的火势减弱了：它发出的光已经变成微茫的暗红色。整个场所空荡荡的，你能见到的只有小矮人和卡乐门人了。在这样的光线中，你很难看清所发生的一切。凭声音判断，小矮人正在进行殊死搏斗。提里安能听见格里佛尔那恶狠狠的叫骂声，不时地还有利什达王爷的呼叫，“尽可能活捉他们！活捉他们！”

不管这场战斗是如何进行的，总之，并没有持续太久。厮杀声很快停息。吉尔看见王爷返回马厩；他身后跟着十一个士兵，每人手里都拖着一个被缚的小矮人（其他的小矮人是否已经被杀，或者逃脱，这就不得而知了）。

“把他们丢进塔什的神殿，”利什达王爷说。

那十一个小矮人于是被逐个丢进或踢进黑暗中，马厩的门重新关上。王爷朝马厩鞠了一躬，说：

“塔什神啊，这都是为你焚烧的祭品！”

所有的卡乐门人都用弯刀敲打起手中的盾牌，齐声高呼：“塔什！塔什！伟大的塔什大神！不可抗拒的塔什！”（这时，没有人再说那荒谬的“塔什兰”了。）

白岩石背后的那一班人看着这一切，小声地议论着。他们发现岩壁上流着一股泉水，便急切地去喝水——吉尔、波金和国王都用双手捧着喝，四足动物则从岩壁下面所形成的小水坑里饮水。他们实在太口渴了，这水成了他们一生中喝到过的最甘美的饮料。当他们喝着泉水时，心里是那么的畅快，其他的一切都暂时忘怀了。

“我敢肯定，”波金说，“天亮以前，我们就得一个个穿过那道黑暗的门了。如果真的得死，其他一百种死法都比这好得多。”

“这确实是一道可怕的门，”提里安说，“它就像一张大嘴。”

“我们就不能想点办法阻止吗？”吉尔说，声音在颤抖。

“不，好朋友，”珠厄儿亲切地用鼻子碰了碰她，说，“也许这就是我们通往阿斯兰的国度的门，今天晚上我们就可以跟他坐在一起喝茶了。”

利什达王爷从马厩门口转过身，慢慢走到白岩石前的一个地方。

“你们听着！”他说，“如果野猪、狗和独角兽愿意向我投降，请求我的宽恕，我可以饶他们不死。野猪可以住到提斯罗克御花园的笼子里去；狗可以到提斯罗克的养狗场去；至于独角兽，等我锯掉他的角，就可以去拉车。但老鹰、两个孩子和那个国王，今天晚上必须献祭给塔什大神。”

回答他的只有愤怒的吼叫。

“勇士们，给我上！”王爷喊叫着，“杀死那几只野兽，活捉两条腿的！”

纳尼亚最后一位国王的最后一场战斗开始了。

除了敌人在人数上的绝对优势，使这一场战斗变得胜利无望的还有他们的长矛。最初参与猿猴的阴谋活动时，卡乐门人是没有长矛的：那时他们假扮成安分守己的商人，三三两两进入纳尼亚，长矛当然带不了，因为无法妥善地把它藏起来。之后到来的卡乐门人可以在纳尼亚畅行无阻，因为那时猿猴的势力已经很强大。有了长矛，情况是大不一样的：只要你身手敏捷，头脑清醒，你就可以在野猪还够不着你时用长矛把野猪刺死，也可以在独角兽够不着你时一枪要了独角兽的命。如今齐刷刷的长矛正一步步向提里安和他的最后几个朋友逼近。随后便是一场殊死的拼杀。

从某种程度上说，这场战斗并不像你所想象的那样糟糕。当你绷紧全身的肌肉——面对长矛的锋芒这里一躲，那里一闪，时而一个冲刺，转瞬一个后撤，忽而一个转身时——你根本没有时间感受恐惧和悲伤。

提里安知道自己已经帮不了别人的忙；他们全都在劫难逃了。他依稀看见野猪在他的身边倒下，珠厄儿在另一边疯狂地搏杀。他瞟见——仅仅是瞟见——一个大个子卡乐门人抓住吉尔的头发，把她拖到什么地方去了。但他无暇思考这一切。他现在考虑的只是如何死得其所。最糟糕的是他不能始终坚持在白岩石边作战。一个同时血战十多个敌人的战士得随时捕捉战机，一旦看见某个敌人的胸口或脖子没有保护好，就得即刻刺杀上去。几个回合下来，你的战场已经几度移位，离最初的战场很远了。提里安很快发现自己已经离白岩石越来越远，离位于右侧的马厩倒越来越近了。他脑子里一直在想，他有必要尽量远离马厩；其中的原因，他自己也说不好。但这一切都不是他自己能做主的。

突然间，一切都变得明朗起来了。他发现自己正在跟利什达王爷厮杀。篝火的余焰就在他们眼前。实际上，他们就在马厩的门口作战；马厩的门已经打开，两个卡乐门人守在门边，只等他进去，这门随时就会关上。他现在想起来了，自从作战一开始，他的敌人就一直有意把他朝马厩这边逼。他心里一边这样想着，一边继续跟王爷奋力拼杀。

提里安这时突然有了一个新的想法。他丢下手中的宝剑，趁利什达高举弯刀的一瞬间直冲过去，双手紧紧抓住敌人的腰带，随即跳进马厩，口中高呼：

“进来吧，见见你的塔什神！”

马厩里传来一阵震耳欲聋的响声。跟猿猴被丢进去时的情形相同，大地震颤起来，随即还闪过一道令人目眩的强光。

马厩外的卡乐门士兵尖叫起来，“塔什，塔什！”马厩的门砰的一声关上了。如果塔什想见到他们的头领，塔什必定会留下他的。但他们无论如何也不想见到塔什。

提里安一时间不知道身在何处，甚至忘记了自己是谁。过了一会儿，他终于站稳脚跟，眨了眨眼睛，看了看四周。马厩里并非他原先想象的那样一团漆黑。他正处在明亮的光辉之中，正是这光辉使他眨起眼睛。

他转身看了看利什达王爷，但利什达并没有看他。利什达发出一声哀号，用手指着前方。随后他便用手捂住脸，向前扑倒在地。提里安朝他手指的方向看了看，明白了一切。

一个可怕的怪物正朝他们走来。这怪物的形体比起他们原先在堡垒见到的那个小了许多，但依然比人高大许多。这是同一类怪物：长着秃鹫的头和四只爪子。它的嘴张开着，眼睛闪闪发光。一阵嘶哑的咯咯声从它的嘴里发出。

“利什达王爷，你们召唤我来到纳尼亚。我来了。你还有什么话说？”

王爷既不敢从地上抬起头，也不敢说一句话。他像一个人打恶嗝那样不停地发抖。在战场上他是很勇敢的；但那天晚上当他第一次意识到真的会有一个塔什时，他的勇气已经减损了一半。留下的另一半勇气现在也丧失尽了。

塔什突然扭了扭身子——就像母鸡低头啄一条小虫子——扑向可怜的利什达，把他夹在他的右前爪下。然后塔什又扭转头，用可怕的一只眼睛斜视着提里安：由于长了一个鸟头，他当然不能直视前方的物体。

但就在这一刻，从塔什的背后，传来一个犹如夏天的海涛那样洪大而深沉的声音：

“去吧，妖怪，带上你合法的祭品，回到你的老巢去吧。我以阿斯兰和阿斯兰之父海外皇帝的名义命令你！”

一听到这声音，丑陋的怪物爪子上夹着利什达王爷，随即消失了。提里安转过身来，想看看说话者是谁。眼前的景象使他的心怦怦直跳，在任何战场上他的心都没有这样激烈地跳动过。

站在他面前的是七个国王和女王，他们头上都戴着王冠，身上的穿戴金光耀眼；几个国王还穿了漂亮的盔甲，手中都握着一把宝剑。

提里安彬彬有礼地向他们鞠了一躬，正要开口时，最年轻的那位女王哈哈大笑起来。他仔细看了看她的脸，吃惊地喘着气，因为他认识她。她就是吉尔。但不是刚才所见的那个满脸尘土、泪眼汪汪、破旧的训练服耷拉在一个肩膀上的吉尔。现在的吉尔清清爽爽，气色很好，好像刚刚沐浴过。一开始他觉得她显得老成了些，但随即又否认了这个看法；在这一点上，他始终没有把握。然后他认出那个最年轻的国王就是尤斯塔斯；他也跟吉尔一样变了模样。

站在这些人面前，提里安忽然觉得尴尬起来，因为他身上都是血污、泥垢和汗水。但转瞬之间他发觉自己也变了样。他的穿戴也变得那样光艳、整洁，气色也是那样焕发，好像要去凯尔帕拉维尔王宫参加一场盛宴。（纳尼亚人的衣着打扮从来不会让人感到不愉快。他们知道如何穿得美观，同时又感觉舒服。在纳尼亚全境，你永远见不到像上浆胶、法兰绒、松紧带一类的东西。）

“陛下，”吉尔走上前来，行了个优雅的屈膝礼，“我来介绍你认识一下纳尼亚的至尊王彼得。”

提里安无须询问谁是至尊王，因为他仍然记得梦中见过的那张脸（只是现在它显得更高贵）。他走上前去，单膝跪下，吻了彼得的手。

“至尊王，”他说，“欢迎你的光临。”

至尊王扶起他，以应有的礼节吻了吻他的双颊。然后至尊王把他带到最年长的女王跟前（其实她并不显老，她的头上没有白发，脸上也没有皱纹），说：“陛下，这位就是波莉夫人，当阿斯兰使树木生长、野兽说话的第一天，她就来过纳尼亚了。”

至尊王然后介绍他认识那位金须拂胸、脸上充满智慧的男子，说：“这位是当初跟波莉夫人一起来这里的迪格雷勋爵。还有这位是我的兄弟，爱德蒙国王。这是我的妹妹露西女王。”

提里安向他们逐一行礼，然后说：“陛下，如果我没有记错读过的编年史，应该还有一位。陛下你不是有两个妹妹吗？苏姗女王在哪里？”

“我的妹妹苏姗，”彼得以严肃的口吻简单地说，“她不再是纳尼亚的朋友了。”

“是啊，”尤斯塔斯说，“每次你跟她提起纳尼亚，或者想让她帮纳尼亚做点什么，她总是说：‘你的记性真好！真想不到你还能想起我们小时候经常玩的游戏。’”

“哦，苏姗！”吉尔说，“她现在感兴趣的只有尼龙啦，唇膏啦，请柬啦什么的。她总是恨不得早点儿长大成人。”

“长大成人，真是的，”波莉夫人说，“我希望她能长大成人。读书的时候她把时间浪费在渴望长大成人上；为了长大成人，她还将浪费她余下的全部生命。她一门心思只想着尽快进入人生最愚蠢的阶段，然后尽可能在这个阶段长久地待下去。”

“好了，我们不谈她了，”彼得说，“看！这树上有很好的果实，我们尝尝吧。”

提里安这时才第一次打量起他的周围，意识到这里的一切真是奇妙无比。





第十三章　小矮人拒绝上当


提里安原以为——如果他有时间思考，他会这样想的——他们只是进入了一间茅草盖顶的小马厩，大约长十二英尺、宽六英尺光景。但事实上他们却站在草地上，头顶是碧蓝的天空，轻柔地吹拂着他们的脸的是初夏的和风。

离他们不远处就有一片树叶茂密的果林，每片叶子下都探头探脑地露出各种各样的果实，有金黄的、淡黄的、紫色的、通红的，那美不胜收的景象是你在我们这个世界从未见过的。累累的果实使提里安相信这季节应该是秋天，但空气中的某种感觉却告诉他时令不可能晚于六月。他们朝果林走了过去。

每人都抬手摘取自己最心仪的果实，但摘下后大家又都愣了好一会儿。果实太漂亮了，致使每人都在诧异：“这不是供我们享受的吧……我们肯定不可以摘吧。”

“没事的，”彼得说，“我知道我们都在想什么。但我相信，完全相信，我们用不着想那么多。我有一个感觉，我们已经来到一个毫无约束的国度。”

“那就吃吧！”尤斯塔斯说。他们于是都吃了起来。

这果子的滋味如何？不幸的是，谁都描述不了。我能够告诉你的是，跟这些果子相比较，你曾经吃过的最鲜美的葡萄是乏味的，汁液最充足的橘子是干枯的，最鲜嫩的梨子是粗硬的、木质化的，最甜的野草莓是酸的。这里的果子没有籽，没有核，没有虫孔。如果你品尝过这样的果子，我们这个世界里最美味可口的东西都将味同苦药了。具体的味道反正我描述不了。你想知道究竟，除非你自己到那个国度去一趟，亲口尝一尝。

吃够了以后，尤斯塔斯对彼得王说：“你还没有告诉我们你们是怎样到达这里的。刚才你正想说，提里安国王就出现了。”

“也没什么好说的，”彼得说，“我和爱德蒙当时就站在月台上，看见你们乘坐的火车开了过来。我只记得当时火车拐弯拐得太快了。我记得我还想过，我们的家人也许都在这班火车上，露西却不知情，这是很好玩的。”

“你们的家人，指的是谁，至尊王？”提里安说。

“我的父母——爱德蒙、露西和我的父母。”

“为什么是他们呢？”吉尔说，“你的意思是不是说他们也知道有关纳尼亚的事？”

“哦，没有，他们跟纳尼亚没有任何关系。他们是到布里斯托尔去的。我听他们说过早上出发。爱德蒙说他们肯定也乘坐这班火车。”（爱德蒙对火车运行情况知道得很多。）

“那之后又发生什么了呢？”吉尔说。

“整个过程还真有点说不清楚，你说是不是，爱德蒙？”至尊王说。

“是的，”爱德蒙说，“这跟上次凭借魔法离开我们那个世界的情景完全不同。这次出现的是一阵可怕的轰鸣声，好像有什么东西砰的一下砸了我，但又没有受伤。我也没有太吃惊——只是激动——这真是太奇怪了。我的膝盖有伤，那是打橄榄球时弄的。我发现膝盖突然不痛了。我感到很轻松。这以后——我们就在这里了。”

“我们在车厢里的情况也是这样，”迪格雷勋爵一边说，一边将留在金黄色的胡子上的最后一点儿水果痕迹擦去，“不同的是，我和你，波莉，都觉得我们的身体不再那么僵硬了。你们年轻人不能理解的。我们不再有衰老的感觉了。”

“‘你们年轻人’，说句实话，”吉尔说，“我并不觉得你们两个比我们大多少。”

“不错，我们现在是这样，但以前不是，”波莉夫人说。

“你们到达这里以后，都发生了什么事呢？”尤斯塔斯问。

“咳，”彼得说，“有很长一段时间——至少我觉得时间很长——什么也没有发生。然后那道门就开了——”

“门？”提里安问。

“是啊，”彼得说，“就是你们进出的那道门啊。你怎么忘了？”

“门在哪里？”

“看，”彼得用手指了指。

提里安朝他所指的方向看去，见到了你所能想象得到的最奇怪、最滑稽的一幕：就在离他们几码远的地方，清楚可见的是，一道粗糙的木门就兀立在阳光下。周边除了门框便一无所有，既没有墙，也没有顶。提里安心怀疑虑地朝这门走过去，其他的人都跟了上去，想看看他到底想干什么。他从门的这边走到那边，发现前后两边居然是一样的。他依然在旷野中，天依然是六月的清晨。那门就那样孤零零地竖立着，好像一棵长在地上的树。

“陛下，”提里安对至尊王说，“这真是一个奇迹。”

“五分钟以前，你跟那个卡乐门人就是从这道门进来的，”彼得笑着说。

“但我当时不是穿过树林，进入马厩的吗？而这道门好像不知从何而来，也不通向任何地方啊。”

“你绕着它走上一圈，情况好像就是这样，”彼得说，“但门上的那两块木板有一条缝，你不妨凑上去，透过门缝看看。”

提里安把眼睛凑到门缝上。一开始，除了一团漆黑，什么也没看见。随着眼睛慢慢适应了那片黑暗，他看见了即将熄灭的篝火所发出的暗红色的火光，以及篝火上方黑魆魆的天空中的星星。然后他还看见了篝火前移动的或站立着的人影；他还能听见他们的谈话，认出那是卡乐门人的口音。由此他意识到，他现在正通过马厩的门观望着他刚打过仗的灯柱荒野的夜景。篝火边的卡乐门人现在正在商量是进入马厩寻找利什达王爷好呢（显然没有人赞成这样做），还是干脆放火烧了马厩。

他回头环顾四周，简直不敢相信自己的眼睛。头顶是蓝天，长满绿草的原野向四面八方延伸。他的朋友都站在他身边，哈哈大笑着。

“这么说来，”提里安说，自己先笑了起来，“从内部看到的马厩跟从外部看到的马厩完全是不一样的。”

“是啊，”迪格雷勋爵说，“它的内部比外部大许多。”

“不错，”露西女王说，“我们的世界也是这样，一个马厩有时就比整个世界还大。”

露西这是第一次开口说话，她的声音有些颤抖，提里安懂得其中的原因。对于眼前发生的一切，她比其他人更激动。她兴奋得连话都说不出来了。提里安想再听听她的话，对她说：

“小姐，请你说下去。告诉我你们所经历的全部冒险。”

“那一阵震颤和喧哗以后，”露西说，“我们就发现自己在这里了。当时我们也跟你一样在门口发愣。然后这门就开了（一开始透过门看见的也是一团漆黑），不一会儿就见门里出来了一个拿着弯刀的大个子男人。从他手中的武器我们知道他是个卡乐门人。

“他举着弯刀，背靠着门框站着，随时准备砍杀进门来的人。我们走到他的身边跟他说话，但看得出他既看不见我们，也听不见我们说话。他也从不看头顶的天空、身边的阳光和草地；我想他一定也看不见这些东西。我们就这样等待了很久。然后就听见门那边传来拔门闩的声音。在他看清来人以前，他并不打算即刻举刀砍杀，由此我们猜想，他一定事先被告知什么人可以砍，什么人应该放行。就在这时门开了，塔什突然出现在门的这边。我们谁也没看清他是从什么地方过来的。然后进来了一只大黄猫。黄猫看了一眼塔什，随即逃命而去；亏得他逃得及时，因为塔什已向他扑过去，门关上时还碰到了塔什的鸟嘴。守在门边的卡乐门人看见塔什，脸色都变白了；他赶紧向怪物鞠躬，但怪物很快消失。

“而后我们又等了很长时间。最后门第三次打开了，这次进来的是一个年轻的卡乐门人。我喜欢这个人。门口的岗哨见到他时大吃一惊。我想，岗哨一直期待的是其他人，不是他——”

“我现在全明白了，”尤斯塔斯说（他有个坏习惯，喜欢打断人家的谈话），“大黄猫是有意先进去的，守门的卡乐门人执行命令，没有伤害他；这样，黄猫出来时就可以说他见到了凶猛的塔什兰，并假装自己受了惊，以便拿这事来吓唬其他的动物。但雪夫特万万没有想到的是，塔什真的出现了。大黄猫逃出来时，倒是真的受了惊吓。这以后，雪夫特就把他想除掉的动物送进去，让岗哨把他们杀死。然后——”

“朋友，”提里安善意地提醒他，“你打断小姐的故事了。”

“好，我接着说，”露西说，“当时岗哨愣住了，这一愣就让那个年轻的卡乐门人赢得了时间保护自己。他们打了起来。年轻人杀死岗哨，把他丢出门外。然后他慢慢走到我们所在的地方。他看得见我们，这里的一切他都看得见。我们想跟他说说话，但他神情恍惚，嘴里一个劲地嚷嚷：‘塔什，塔什，塔什在哪里？我要见塔什。’我们也就只好放弃跟他谈话的打算，让他独自走到别的地方去了——他现在去了那边。我喜欢这个人。这以后……呸！”露西说到这里，做了个鬼脸。

“这以后，”爱德蒙接着露西的话头说下去，“有人把猿猴丢进门来。塔什又出现了。我的妹妹心地太善良，下面的话她没有说。塔什当时就用嘴一啄，猿猴即刻就没命了。”

“活该！”尤斯塔斯说，“反正都一样，我巴不得真的塔什不保佑他。”

“再以后，”爱德蒙说，“就来了那十来个小矮人。然后就是吉尔和尤斯塔斯，最后是你自己。”

“我巴不得塔什把那些小矮人也吃了，”尤斯塔斯说，“那班小猪猡！”

“不，他没有，”露西说，“别说吓人的话了。他们都在那里。从这里你就能看见他们。我一直想跟他们交朋友，就是没有结果。”

“跟他们交朋友？”尤斯塔斯叫了起来，“你知道这些小矮人做了什么好事吗？”

“别说了，尤斯塔斯，”露西说，“过去看看他们吧。提里安国王，也许你能做点什么事帮帮他们。”

“今天我对小矮人没有好感，”提里安说，“既然你为他们求情，小姐，我不妨对他们格外开恩。”

露西在前引路，他们很快见到了那班小矮人。他们的神情都很古怪。用来捆绑他们的绳子似乎消失了，但他们既没有在散步，也没有在玩耍，更没有躺下来休息。他们紧紧地围坐在一起，相互对视着。他们从不环顾四周，直到露西和提里安走得很近，几乎碰到他们时，才注意到有人走了过来。小矮人们随即昂起头，好像依然看不见他们，只能凭耳朵仔细地听，再凭声音猜测发生了什么事。

“小心！”其中一个小矮人粗声粗气地说，“走好自己的路。别踩到我们的脸上！”

“好啊！”尤斯塔斯也生气了，“我们不是瞎子。我们头上长着眼睛呢。”

“如果你们在这里看得见东西，那你们的眼睛真好得见鬼了，”说话的还是刚才那个小矮人，他的名字叫迪格尔。

“在哪里？”爱德蒙问。

“嘿，你这笨蛋，当然是这里啦，”迪格尔说，“在这漆黑一团、又破又小、臭气熏天、洞窟似的马厩里。”

“你们眼瞎了吗？”

“在这黑暗中，大家不都是瞎子吗？”迪格尔说。

“但这里并不黑，你们这些可怜的、愚蠢的小矮人，”露西说，“你们看不见吗？抬起头来！看看周围！你们没看见天空、树木和鲜花吗？你们没看见我吗？”

“我凭谎言起誓，并不存在的东西，你让我怎么看啊？在这黑咕隆咚的鬼地方，你看不见我，我怎么能看得见你？”

“但我能看见你，”露西说，“我能证明我看见了你。你嘴上还叼着一个烟斗呢。”

“只要能闻到烟草味，这话任何人都可以说，”迪格尔说。

“啊，可怜的东西！这太可怕了，”露西说。她想到了一个办法。她蹲下身，摘了几朵紫罗兰。“听好了，小矮人，”她说，“即便你们的眼睛出了问题，你们的鼻子也许是正常的。能闻到它吗？”她挪过身子，将湿漉漉的鲜花递到迪格尔丑陋的鼻子底下。但为了避开小矮人的铁拳，她不得不赶紧往后跳开。

“去你的！”小矮人吼叫起来，“胆子真大！你把马厩里肮脏的干草弄到我的鼻子底下来，是何居心？干草上还有刺呢。一股子的酱油味！你到底是什么人？”

“泥土人啊，”提里安说，“她是阿斯兰从遥远的过去派来的露西女王。我，你们的合法国王提里安，就是看在她的面子上才不把你们的脑袋从肩膀上砍下来。事实已证明，双倍地证明，你们是一班不义之徒。”

“真是一派胡言！”迪格尔嚷嚷着说，“你怎么还敢说这一大堆废话？你那只了不起的狮王怎么不来救你们啊？想不到吧。现在——即便现在——你们已经被打败，跟我们一样被人塞进这黑咕隆咚的洞窟里，你还要玩把戏啊。还要再编个谎话啊！还要让我们相信我们没有被关起来，这里并不黑暗啊！天晓得你们安的是什么心！”

“这里没有黑咕隆咚的洞窟，那只是你的想象，傻瓜，”提里安大声说。“出来吧。”提里安俯身向前，抓住迪格尔的腰带和兜帽，把他从小矮人的圈子里拎出。但一等提里安放下他，迪格尔便跑回到他的伙伴中，一边擦了擦鼻子，一边大声地吼叫着：

“哇，哇！你这是要干什么？我的脸都撞到墙上了。你差点把我的鼻子撞破了。”

“我的天哪，”露西说，“我们还能为他们做点什么呢？”

“随他们去吧，”尤斯塔斯说。说话间大地震颤起来了。芳香的空气突然变得更加芳香。一道亮光从他们身后闪现。大家转过身去。提里安最后一个转身，因为他心里有点害怕。他日夜盼望的阿斯兰，那头巨大的、真正的金毛狮王就站在那里，其他的人已围着他的前爪跪倒在地，把他们的手和脸埋进他的鬃毛里；他则低下他的大脑袋，用舌头舔着他们。狮王的目光然后转移到提里安身上；提里安颤抖着走上前去，投身在他的脚下。狮王吻了吻他，说：“干得好，纳尼亚最后一位国王，你在最黑暗的时刻依然很坚强。”

“阿斯兰，”露西泪水汪汪地说，“你能不能——可不可以——为这些可怜的小矮人做点什么？”

“亲爱的，”阿斯兰说，“我要向你显示什么是我能做的，什么是我无能为力的。”他走近小矮人，朝他们发出一声低吼；声音虽然不大，但所有的空气都在晃动。但小矮人们却说：“听到了吗？又是马厩那边这班人在捣鬼。想用这声音吓唬我们。这声音一定是他们用什么机器弄出来的。别去理睬他们。他们再也不能让我们上当了。”

阿斯兰抬起头，摇了摇鬃毛。小矮人的膝头前即刻出现丰盛的筵席：馅饼、鸭舌、鸽子肉、各种甜食和冰淇淋，每个小矮人的右手上还有一杯好酒。但这也无济于事。他们贪婪地吃着喝着，但显然品尝不出滋味。他们总觉得吃的喝的都是马厩里现成的东西。一个说他正在吃干草，另一个说他吃到了一片陈年萝卜，第三个说他发现了一片生菜叶子。他们将盛有美酒的金杯高高举起，说：“呸！想不到我们竟然得喝槽子里的脏水，那本是给驴子喝的呀！真想不到我们倒霉到这等地步。”

吃了不一会儿，每个小矮人都开始怀疑别人吃的东西比自己的好，于是开始又抢又夺，争吵不休，不久便扭打起来，好端端的食物都泼到了各自的脸上、衣服上，或被踩在脚下。

当他们终于坐下来护理被打黑的眼眶和流血的鼻子时，他们都说：“至少这里没有骗人的鬼话。我们不会让人家欺骗我们。小矮人站在小矮人的立场上。”

“你们看，”阿斯兰说，“他们并不想让我们帮助他们。他们选择了狡诈，抛弃了信仰。他们的牢狱就在他们自己的脑子里，他们现在仍待在那里。由于太害怕上当，他们已经走不出这个牢狱了。来吧，孩子们，我还有其他的事要做呢。”

他走向门口，其他的人都跟着他。他抬起头吼叫了一声，“时候到了！”然后又吼了一声，“时候到了！”他的声音那么洪亮，天上的星星都颤抖了。随着这声音，马厩的门开了。





第十四章　黑夜降临纳尼亚


他们都站在阿斯兰的右侧，透过门观望。

篝火已经熄灭了。大地一片黑暗；事实上，如果你看不见树影子的终结处有星星在闪耀，你就不可以说自己正在眺望一片树林。阿斯兰又吼叫了一声，他们随即看见左侧出现了另一片阴影。那是没有星星的阴影；它越升越高，最后变成一个人形，巨人中最大的巨人。他们都十分熟悉纳尼亚，因此能确定这巨人所处的位置。巨人显然站在那片向北延伸，越过什里伯尔河的高高的沼地上。

吉尔和尤斯塔斯记得清楚：很久以前，在那片沼地的一个深洞里，他们看见过一个巨人在那里睡觉，有人说，他就是时间老人，到了世界末日的那一天，他就会苏醒过来。

“是的，”他们没有说话，但阿斯兰独个儿在说，“当他躺在那里睡觉时，他的名字叫‘时间’。现在他醒了过来，应该有一个新的名字了。”

这时，巨人把一个号角举到嘴边。根据黑影在繁星映衬下所发生的形态变化，他们看见了这一姿势。这以后——过了好一会儿，因为声音传得很慢——便听见了号角声：高亢而可怕，但具有一种奇怪而极致的美。

转瞬之间，天空布满了流星。即便只有一颗流星，那景象也很好看；现在却是十几颗，然后是几十颗、数百颗一齐坠落，最后便形成银色的雨，在持续不断地下着。这阵银雨过后，他们中有人在想：天空中又会出现一片跟黑色的巨人相似的阴影了。但阴影所处的位置这一次就在他们的头顶，如果你愿意，不妨称之为“天顶”。爱德蒙心里想：“它也许是一片乌云。”不管怎么说，那里确实已不再有星星，只有一片黑暗。它的周围，流星雨仍在继续下着。无星的区域在扩大，向天顶的外围延伸。很快，四分之一的天空变黑了，随后是半个天空，最后，流星雨已下在了地平线附近。

怀着惊奇（同时也怀着恐惧）的心情，他们突然意识到所发生的一切。逐渐扩展的黑暗根本不是什么乌云，而是一个虚空。天空中黑暗处再也没有星星了。所有的星星都已坠落：阿斯兰把它们全召回家了。

流星雨结束前的几秒钟是激动人心的。星星都坠落在他们的周围。那个世界的星星并不是我们这个世界所见的发光的星星。他们其实都是人（爱德蒙和露西就曾经碰见过这样的人）。现在的流星雨其实就是闪闪发光的人从天空中阵雨般倾泻而下，他们长长的头发像燃烧的银丝，手中的长矛像白热化的金属，他们从黑暗的空中朝他们奔泻而来，速度比坠落的石块还快。当他们落到地面上并烧着了草木时，都发出嘶嘶的声响。这些流星人从他们身边滑过，站到了他们背后偏右的某个地方。

这对他们倒是好事：由于空中已没有星星，如果地面上再没有这些流星，一切将陷入无边的黑暗中，你将看不见任何东西。如今这成群的流星在他们身后发出强烈的光芒，他们就能清楚地看见伸展在他们面前的一片片纳尼亚的森林，它们好像都被泛光灯照亮了。每一片灌木丛，甚至每一片草叶，它的背后都有一片阴影。每一片叶子的背影是那么的历历分明，你甚至会觉得背影的边缘足以划破你的手指。

他们自己的影子就投射在前面的草地上。了不得的是阿斯兰的影子，它向左侧铺展开去，大得十分吓人。这一切都出现在一个没有星星的天空底下。

来自他们身后（偏右一点儿）的光是那样强烈，甚至将北方沼地的山坡都照亮了。那里有物体在移动。巨大的动物正悄悄地爬下山坡，进入纳尼亚：有巨龙、巨蜥和长有蝙蝠翅膀的巨鸟。他们消失在树林里，这以后安静了几分钟。

随后响起的是号啕的痛哭声——起初那声音来自远处——接着便是来自四面八方的沙沙声和啪嗒声，以及飞禽的振翼声。声音越来越近。很快你就能分辨出小脚的跳跃和大爪子的踩踏，分辨出小蹄子的嘚嘚声和大蹄子的隆隆巨响。他们这时已能看见成千上万双眼睛在闪烁。最后，从树丛的阴影里窜出成千上万，数以百万的动物，为了保全自己的性命奔向山坡。他们中各种各样的动物都有——包括会说话的各种野兽、小矮人、树精、羊怪、巨人、卡乐门人、阿钦兰人、独脚人，以及来自遥远的岛屿和鲜为人知的西部的奇异动物。所有的动物和人类，都跑向阿斯兰身边的那个门。

这一景象在当时看上去像一个梦，事后就更难回忆清楚了。尤其是，你无法说清这个过程持续了多久。有时你会觉得此事只发生在几分钟之内；有时你又会觉得它经历了许多年。显而易见，这么多的生灵是很难通过这个门的，除非它变得越来越宽，或者所有的野兽转瞬之间都变成了小昆虫。但这一点当时大家都没想过。

众多的生灵涌了过来，越来越靠近那些站立着的星星，他们的眼睛也变得越来越明亮了。但当他们来到阿斯兰面前，每个生灵都会发生一点或两点变化。他们的眼睛都直视着阿斯兰，我知道，这是他们必须做的，别无选择。有一部分生灵看着他时，脸上的表情会发生可怕的变化：那是一种恐惧和仇恨。在会说话的野兽的脸上，这种恐惧和仇恨只在脸上停留了短短的一刹那；你可以见到，他们突然不能再说话，又重新成了普通的哑巴动物。所有以这种惶恐而仇视的目光看着阿斯兰的生灵这时都突然转向右边，即狮王的左侧，消失在那巨大的黑暗的深渊之中。正如你已经听说的那样，这深渊是一直往门的左侧延伸下去的。孩子们从此再也见不到他们。他们后来的情况如何，我也不得而知。

但另外一些生灵，虽然他们看着阿斯兰时也一样地感到恐惧，但他们是爱着他的。所有这些生灵都涌向了狮王的右侧，并进入了那个门。他们中有几位是很特殊的。尤斯塔斯认出其中一位小矮人还用箭射过那些会说话的马。但他此时没时间想那么多（这毕竟不是他考虑的事），由于兴奋，其他的一切都已抛在脑后。本以为战亡的那几个动物此时也在蜂拥而至的幸福的生灵中，跑到了提里安和他的朋友跟前：他们是人头马鲁威特、独角兽珠厄儿、善良的野猪和熊、千里眼老鹰、可爱的狗儿和马儿，还有小矮人波金。

“更高更远！”人头马一边高叫着，一边向西疾奔而去。虽然大家不懂这句话的意思，但依然十分振奋。野猪兴致勃勃地跟他们唠叨。熊正打算向他们抱怨自己迟钝的理解力，却一眼看见了他们身后的果树，于是摇摆着身子，以最快的速度奔到果树跟前，不用说，那里的东西是他能理解的。但狗儿们摇着尾巴留了下来；波金也留了下来，还跟他们一一握手，诚实的脸上堆满了笑容。珠厄儿将他雪白的头靠在国王的肩膀上，听国王跟他说悄悄话。这时，门那边所发生的事再次引起大家的注意。

他们看见，现在的纳尼亚已是龙和巨蜥的天下了。他们东窜西窜，将树木连根拔起，像吃美味似的将树木大吃大嚼。渐渐地，树木都消失了。整个国家成了不毛之地，你能见到的只有事物的轮廓——那些山脊和山洞——这在以前是引不起你的注意的。绿草死了。提里安很快发现，他眼前的世界只剩下岩石和泥土。你不敢相信那里曾经生活过任何生物。怪物们自己也老了，躺下死了。他们的肉体干枯了，露出了骨头。很快，他们都成了巨大的骷髅，散落在光秃秃的岩背上，看上去好像已经死了数千年。很久很久，一切都归于沉寂。

最后，一种白茫茫的东西——在站立的流星人的光芒照耀下，那东西就像一条白线——从世界的东端向他们移动过来。一阵响彻大地的声音打破了沉寂：一开始只是低语，接着是轰鸣，再以后便是怒吼。现在他们能看到奔腾而来的是什么，其来势又是何等的迅疾了。那是一道喷吐着泡沫的水墙！大海正在上涌。那个没有树木的世界，你能看得很清楚。你能看见所有的河流越来越宽，所有的湖泊越来越大，独立的湖泊连成了一片，山谷变成了新湖，山丘变成了小岛，小岛随即变成海洋。左侧高高的沼地和右侧巍峨的群山都在水的咆哮和拍打声中轰然坍塌，化为涌动的海水。大水打着漩涡一直涌到那道门的跟前（但始终越不过门槛），水花就在阿斯兰的脚下飞溅！现在，从他们站立的地方一直到水天相接之处，已是一片汪洋了。

外面的天开始亮了。一缕阴沉的、不祥的曙光铺展在地平线上，并逐渐扩散，越发明亮，直到他们几乎忽视了身后的星星所发出的光辉。最后太阳出来了。迪格雷勋爵和波莉夫人相互对视了一下，微微点了点头；他们两人曾在另一个世界见到过一个垂死的太阳，这时即刻明白这个太阳也快死了。这太阳比平常所见的那个大了三倍——二十倍——它是呈暗红色的。当它的光芒照在时间巨人身上时，时间巨人也变红了。在太阳的映照下，整个无边无际的大海洋也变得血一样的红。

然后月亮也出来了，但她所处的位置不对，非常接近太阳，看上去也是红的。一看见月亮，太阳便向她喷吐出熊熊的火焰，那光芒就像火红的胡须或长虫。他此刻就像一条伸着触须的章鱼，想把月亮搂入他的怀抱。也许他是在强行拉她。不管怎么说，她在靠近他，一开始很缓慢，随后逐渐加快速度，直到他长长的火焰将她团团围住，双方融为一体，变成一个大火球，就像一块燃烧着的煤。火块一团团坠落大海，蒸汽随即升腾而起。

阿斯兰这时说：“现在可以结束了。”

时间巨人于是把他的号角丢进大海。然后他朝天空伸出手——那手黑魆魆的，长达数千英里——抓住了太阳。他把太阳抓在手里挤压，就像你挤压一个橘子。不一会儿，天地间全漆黑一片了。

凛冽的寒风从门口吹了进来，门框上都结起了冰柱。除了阿斯兰大家都从门口跳了回来。

“纳尼亚的至尊王彼得，”阿斯兰说，“把门关上。”

已经冻得瑟瑟发抖的彼得在黑暗中探出身子，把门拉上。门在彼得的拉动中擦过冰凌。然后，他十分笨拙地掏出一把金钥匙（此时他的手已经冻得麻木，有点发紫了），把门锁上。

透过那道门，他们已经见识了足够多的奇迹。比所有的奇迹更让人惊奇的是：当他们转过身来，发现自己已经在温暖的阳光底下，头顶是蔚蓝的天空，脚下盛开着鲜花。阿斯兰的眼里满含着笑意。

他迅速转过身，蹲得低低的，甩打着尾巴，随即像一支金箭一样冲了出去。

“来吧，更远！来吧，更高！”他回头召唤着。但谁能赶上他的步伐呢？大家都跟在他后面，朝着西方前进。

“这么说，”彼得说，“黑夜降临纳尼亚了。怎么，露西！你哭了吗？阿斯兰在前面，我们都在这里，你哭什么呀？”

“别劝我了，彼得，”露西说，“我相信，阿斯兰也不会阻止我痛哭的。我相信，哀悼纳尼亚并没有错。想想所有那些死去的和冻死在门外的生灵吧。”

“是啊，我也曾经希望过，”吉尔说，“纳尼亚会永远存在下去。我知道我们那个世界不可能永存；但我以为纳尼亚是有可能的。”

“我亲眼看见纳尼亚的开创，”迪格雷勋爵说，“没有想到我还能活着见到它的消亡。”

“诸位，”提里安说，“女人都爱哭。看，我自己也哭了。我经历过母亲的去世。除了纳尼亚，我还认识什么世界呢？如果我们不为它流泪，虽然谈不上道德问题，但毕竟是不恭敬的。”

他们离开了那道门，离开了那班挤坐在想象中的马厩里的小矮人。他们边走边谈，追忆旧日的战争、和平、已故的国王们以及纳尼亚的一切光荣。

狗儿们依然跟他们在一起。他们也参与谈话，但说得不多，因为他们总是忙于跑前跑后，时不时地要嗅嗅草地上的气味，直到他们自己打起喷嚏。突然，他们闻到了一种气味，这使他们十分兴奋。他们还为此争论起来——“是的，在这里——不对，在这边——这正是我说过的那种气味——任何一只狗都闻得出来的——让开你的大鼻子，让别的狗上来闻吧。”

“闻到什么啊，孩子们？”彼得说。

“一个卡乐门人，陛下，”几只狗同时回答。

“带我们去看看，”彼得说，“不管他是友好的还是充满敌意的，我们都欢迎他。”

狗儿们冲上前去，不一会儿又不惜性命似的跑了回来，汪汪吠叫着说真的有一个卡乐门人（会说话的狗跟普通的狗一样，做什么事都喜欢虚张声势，觉得自己在做的事重要得不得了）。

其他人跟随带路的狗儿，很快发现一个年轻的卡乐门人坐在一棵栗子树底下，他身边是一条清澈的小溪。此人就是伊默斯。他即刻立起身，十分严肃地向他们鞠了一躬。

“先生，”他对彼得说，“我不知道你是朋友还是敌人，但我都以见到你们为荣。有位诗人不是说过吗，高贵的朋友是一件极优的礼物，高贵的敌人是一件次优的礼物？”

“先生，”彼得说，“我知道我们之间已经不需要战争了。”

“告诉我们你是谁，怎么会来到这里？”吉尔说。

“如果你的故事一言难尽，那就让大家坐下来，先喝点水吧，”狗儿们说，“我们都喘着粗气呢。”

“你一直像刚才那样到处乱跑，当然得喘粗气啦，”尤斯塔斯说。

几个人于是在草地上坐下。狗儿们吵吵嚷嚷地在溪里喝了个够，然后也挺直腰杆坐了下来，嘴里喘着气，舌头挂在嘴巴的一侧，一本正经地听卡乐门人讲故事。珠厄儿依然站着，正用他的角摩擦腹部，以便将角擦亮。





第十五章　更高更远


“勇武的国王们啊，”伊默斯说，“美得使宇宙明亮的女士们啊，告诉你们，我是伊默斯，大沙漠以西的泰希邦城的哈发王爷的第七子。最近我随利什达王爷统率的二十九名士兵来到纳尼亚。最初听说我们将进军纳尼亚时，我还不胜欣喜呢：有关你们国家的事我听说了许多，一心想在战场上会会你们。但后来当我得知我们得乔装打扮成商人（穿商人的衣服对于一个战士和王爷之子来说是丢人的），从事欺骗和阴谋活动时，我就兴奋不起来了。最糟糕的是，我发现我们还得侍候一只猿猴，有人还开始宣扬塔什和阿斯兰合二为一，这时世界在我眼中就是一团漆黑了。自孩提时候起，我一直都信奉塔什，我的宏愿就是想更多地认识他，如果可能，见见他的真容。对于阿斯兰，当时我对他只有憎恨。

“你们都看见了，每天晚上我们都被召集到那间茅草棚的外面，那里点着篝火，猿猴从茅草棚里牵出一只长有四条腿的东西。那是什么神灵，我始终没能看清楚，只知道人和兽都得向它磕头，向它致敬。我当时心里想过，王爷上了猿猴的当了：从马厩里出来的那个东西既不是塔什，也不是其他神灵。但当我观察了王爷的脸，留意了他跟猿猴说过的每一句话以后，这才恍然大悟：王爷自己也不相信这一切，他甚至根本不相信塔什的存在。如果真有塔什，他敢嘲弄他吗？

“懂得这一点以后，我不由得怒火中烧，我只是感到诧异：塔什真神为什么不用天火将猿猴和王爷击毙。然而，我还是强忍怒火，保持着沉默，我要看看事情会有什么样的结果。但昨天晚上，你们中有几位也知道，猿猴没有把那披黄皮的东西带出来，却说谁想要见塔什兰——他们把两个名字混合在一起，谎称他们是一体的——必须逐一进入草棚。我当时就想，这一定又是什么新的花招。后来那只黄猫进去了，随即又在疯狂的恐惧中逃出来，这时我就想，一定是那位他们一再召唤，但并不真正认识或信奉的塔什神为了替自己报仇，来到了我们中间。虽然我的内心因对塔什大神的恐惧而战栗，但我的愿望比恐惧更强烈。我竭力克制两膝的颤抖，牙齿的打战，下决心要见一见塔什，即便被他杀掉也在所不惜。我因此主动要求进入马厩，王爷虽然不情愿，还是让我进去了。

“我一走进马厩的门，首先惊奇地发现自己处在明亮的阳光底下（就像我们现在这样），尽管从外部看，这里面是一团漆黑的。但我还来不及为此惊讶，因为我马上得为保全自己的性命跟自己的人进行搏杀。一看见那人我心里就明白了：猿猴和王爷安排他守在那里，就是要杀掉不参与他们的阴谋却擅闯马厩的任何人；这个岗哨显然也是一个骗子，一个嘲弄者，而不是塔什的真正仆人。我怀着更坚强的信念与他交战，把这个恶徒杀了，并将他抛出门外。

“然后我环顾四周，看见了蓝天和旷野，闻到了一阵芳香。我对自己说：神灵啊，这真是个好地方；我也许已经来到塔什的国度。我于是踏上这奇妙的国度，开始寻找他。

“就这样，我走过许多草地和鲜花，穿过一片片生机勃勃、赏心悦目的树林，终于在两块巨石之间的一个不大的地方，迎面碰上了一头大狮子。他的步伐如鸵鸟般轻盈，体形如大象般庞大，毛发如纯金般闪亮，一对眼睛亮晶晶的，就像熔炉中化为液体的黄金。他比拉戈尔火山更让人望而生畏，论俊美超过世界上一切生灵，就像盛开的玫瑰兀立于沙漠的尘土之上。

“我当时就向他下跪了，心想这回我必死无疑，因为这头值得万众敬仰的狮子一定知道我向来服侍的是塔什，而不是他。然而，与其在人间做一个提斯罗克而活着，永远见不到他，我倒宁愿见到这头狮子而死去。但这时这光荣的狮王却低下他金色的脑袋，用他的舌头碰了碰我的额头，说：‘孩子，欢迎你。’我说：‘哎呀，主啊，我却不是你的孩子，我是塔什的仆人啊。’他回答：‘孩子，我把你对塔什的奉献，都当作对我的奉献。’出于求知和觉悟的巨大欲望，我克服恐惧，向光荣的王提问：‘主啊，据猿猴说，你和塔什是一体的，这话是真的吗？’狮王听后吼叫起来，大地为之颤抖（但他的发怒并不针对我），他说：‘这是谎言。我把你对它的奉献归在我的身上，并不因为我跟他是一体的，而是因为我们正好截然相反。我跟他有着本质上的区别。凡是邪恶的奉献都不可能归于我，凡是善的奉献也不可能归于他。因此，以塔什起誓的任何人，只要他信守誓言本身，那他的誓言就是发给我的，酬谢他的也是我，尽管他自己并不知情。不管什么人，如果他以我的名义作恶，尽管他说的是阿斯兰的名字，但他供奉的是塔什，他的恶行也为塔什所接受。这个道理你懂了吗，孩子？’我说：‘主啊，我是否懂了，你是知道的。’接着我又说（为了真理，我不得不说）：‘但我一生中一直在寻找塔什。’光荣的狮王说：‘亲爱的，如果你不是一直渴望找到我，你是不会找得这么久、这么诚心的。只要有诚心，所有的人都能找到自己想找的东西。’

“说完，他向我吹了口气，使我的四肢不再发抖，能稳稳地站立起来。这以后，他没有再多说，只说我们还会见面，我必须朝更高更远的地方前进。他随后便在金色的暴风雨中急转身子，突然离我而去。

“这以后，国王和女士们啊，我便这里那里到处奔走，希望能再见到他。我的幸福是那么巨大，甚至像伤口那样使我全身乏力。这真是奇迹中的奇迹，他还叫我‘亲爱的’呢，而我不过像一条狗——”

“嗯？这是什么话呀？”一只狗儿说。

“先生，”伊默斯说，“这只是我们卡乐门人的习惯用语。”

“那么，我要说，这样的习惯用语我可不太喜欢，”那只狗儿说。

“他说这话并无恶意，”一只上了年纪的狗说，“当我们的小狗不听话时，我们也管它叫‘小男孩’呢。”

“我们也是这样，”第一只狗儿说，“有时就叫‘小女孩’。”

“好了好了！”那只上了年纪的狗说，“这都是不该说的。记住这是在什么地方。”

“看！”吉尔突然叫了起来。有只动物怯生生地朝他们走了过来——长有四条腿，一身的银灰色，模样很优雅。大家盯着他看了足足十秒钟，五六个声音这才同时叫起来，“呀，是老驴帕塞尔！”他们至今还从未见过他大白天脱下狮皮时的模样，形象确实大不一样。他又恢复了他自己：一只穿着柔软的灰色外套的漂亮的驴，脸上的神情那么温和、诚实。你一旦看见他，一定会像吉尔和露西那样跑过去，搂住他的脖子，亲吻他的鼻子，抚摸他的耳朵。

大家问他最近一直在哪里，他说他跟其他的动物一起进入了那个门，但他始终——说句实话，始终远远地避开他们，避开阿斯兰。因为一看见真正的狮王，他便为自己曾经披上狮皮这件荒唐事感到无比的羞愧，以至不知道如何面对任何人。当他看见他的朋友都在向西方进发，再加上吃了一两口草（“我这一生从未吃过这么好吃的草，”帕塞尔说），这才鼓足勇气跟了上来。“但如果真的见到了阿斯兰，我得怎么办才好，这一点我真的不知道，”他最后补充说。

“当你真正见到了阿斯兰，你会发现什么事也没有，”露西女王说。

他们于是一块儿上路，始终朝着西方，因为这是阿斯兰在说“更高更远”一语时指示的方向。许多其他的动物也都朝着这个方向缓慢地向前行走，那片草地非常开阔，毫无拥挤之感。

天色尚早，凌晨的清新气息仍停留在空气中。他们不断地停下脚步四下观望，或回头张望，一部分原因是景色优美，另一部分原因是：还有某些东西他们不能理解。

“彼得，”露西说，“你知道这是什么地方吗？”

“我不知道，”至尊王说，“它使我想起一个地方，但又记不起来。它会不会是我们很小的时候度假的地方啊？”

“这样的假一定度得开心极了，”尤斯塔斯说，“我敢打赌，在我们那个世界不会有这么好的一个地方。看看这些色彩吧，在我们那个世界的高山上，你就见不到这样一种蓝色。”

“这是阿斯兰的国度吧？”提里安说。

“并不像阿斯兰的国度，那是在世界尽东头的高山上，”吉尔说，“那地方我去过。”

“如果你们问我，”爱德蒙说，“这里很像纳尼亚的某个地方。看看前方的大山了吧——还有大山后面的冰山。它们不跟我们在纳尼亚见到的那些山，即大瀑布以西的山脉很相似吗？”

“是啊，是很相似，”彼得说，“只是这些山更高大些。”

“我觉得这些山跟纳尼亚的山并不相似，”露西说，“但看那边，”她向南指了指他们的左边，大家都停下来转身张望。“那些小山，”露西说，“那些树木茂盛的山，还有背后那些蓝莹莹的山——它们不是跟纳尼亚的南部边疆很相似吗？”

“太像了！”爱德蒙沉默了片刻后叫了起来，“咳，它们简直一模一样，看，那是双峰并峙的皮尔山，从那里可以进入阿钦兰和许多其他地方。”

“又有些不像，”露西说，“它们有不同之处。那里的色彩更丰富，看上去比我印象中的更遥远，更——更——嗳，我也说不好了……”

“比原物更真实，”迪格雷勋爵轻声说。

老鹰千里眼突然展开翅膀，飞上三四十英尺的高空，在那里盘旋了一会儿，随后降落在地上。

“国王们，女王们，”他大声说，“我们刚才全都成瞎子了，现在才开始弄清我们所处的位置。从上面我已经全看见了——艾丁斯荒野、河狸大坝、大河和凯尔帕拉维尔，全都闪闪烁烁地出现在东海沿岸呢。纳尼亚并没有消亡。这里就是纳尼亚。”

“怎么可能呢？”彼得说，“阿斯兰对我们几位年纪稍大的说过，我们再也不会回到纳尼亚了。但现在我们却又在这里。”

“是啊，”尤斯塔斯说，“我们明明看到它毁灭了，连太阳都熄灭了。”

“这肯定不一样的，”露西说。

“老鹰没有说错，”迪格雷勋爵说，“听我说，彼得。当阿斯兰说你们再也不能回到纳尼亚时，他指的是你当时心目中的纳尼亚。那个纳尼亚不是真正的纳尼亚，因为它是有开始，又有终结的。它只是真正的纳尼亚的一个影子，或者说一个摹本；真正的纳尼亚是一直存在的，将来也是。就像我们的英格兰和世界其他所有的地方，它们只是阿斯兰那个真正的世界的影子和摹本。你用不着为纳尼亚伤心流泪，露西。旧的纳尼亚中重要的东西，即那些可爱的动物，都通过那个门进入真正的纳尼亚了。这里面当然有区别，就像真实的东西之于影子，或者说醒着时的生活之于梦境。”

当他说这话时，他的声音就像喇叭一样使每个人感到振奋；他随后又补充了一句，“这都是柏拉图说过的，柏拉图说过的。我的天，现在的学校教了他们什么呀？”年纪较大的几个孩子都哈哈大笑起来。这正是很久以前他们在另一个世界时经常听他说过的一句话，那时他的胡子是灰白的，不是现在的金黄。他知道他们发笑的原因，自己也笑了。不过，他们很快变得严肃起来：你知道的，某种幸福和神奇的感觉是会让人变严肃的。一切变得太美妙了，你哪有时间浪费在说笑上啊。

你很难说清楚这个阳光普照的世界跟那个昔日的纳尼亚究竟有什么区别，就像你无法说清这里的果子的滋味一样。如果你这样去思考，也许能得出一个大致的概念。假设你待在一个房间里，那里有一扇窗看得见一个漂亮的海湾，或者一个在群山中蜿蜒的山谷。背对着窗口的墙上挂着一面镜子。当你从窗口转过身来，你会突然发现那个海湾或那个山谷全映衬在镜子里。从某种程度上说，镜子里的海或镜子里的山谷，跟外面真正的山和海是一样的。但同时又有区别——你会觉得它们更神奇、更美妙，更像故事中的某个地方——那故事你好像从来没有听人说起过，因此特别想知道。

老的纳尼亚跟新的纳尼亚之间的区别也是这样。新的纳尼亚是一片更神奇的土地：那里的每一块岩石、每一朵鲜花、每一片树叶看上去好像都意义深远。我的话只能说到这里；如果你亲临那片土地，你会懂得我的意思的。

倒是独角兽说出了大家内心的感受。他用右前蹄跺了跺地，嘶叫着说：

“我终于到家了！这就是我的国家！我属于这里。尽管我现在才见到，它却是我终生所寻求的土地。我热爱老的纳尼亚的原因就在于它有点像这个地方。呵呵——来吧，向着更高，向着更远！”

独角兽晃了晃鬃毛，随即向前飞奔而去——在我们这个世界，独角兽一旦飞奔起来，转瞬之间就能跑得不见踪影。但现在发生了一件奇怪的事：每个人都开始奔跑，令人惊讶的是，他们居然都能跟上独角兽，不光是狗儿和人，还有肥胖的帕塞尔、短腿的小矮人，都没有落下。风吹在他们的脸上，那感觉就像坐在没有挡风玻璃的车子上疾驰。田野从他们眼前掠过，那感觉就像坐在快速列车上朝窗外张望。他们越跑越快，但谁也没有感觉到热，既不累也不喘气。





第十六章　告别幻影世界


如果一个人跑步时不会疲劳，我想他一定不想再做其他的事了。但总会有某种特殊的原因需要你停下，尤斯塔斯突然呼叫着停下脚步就属于这种情况：

“我说，大家停一停！看看我们来到了哪里！”

他确实有必要这样做，因为此时出现在他们面前的是大锅湖和高高的悬崖。还有那个大瀑布，它每秒钟都有数千吨的水从悬崖倾泻而下，水流有几处闪闪耀耀的像金刚钻，另几处像深绿色的玻璃。雷鸣般的声响不绝于耳。

“别停下！向着更高，向着更远！”千里眼一边说，一边斜着身子稍稍往上飞行。

“这对他来说太容易了，”尤斯塔斯说。

但珠厄儿也叫了起来：“别停下！向着更远，向着更高！迈开大步前进！”

独角兽的声音几乎被水的轰鸣声盖过；不一会儿，大家都看见他踏进了湖水，其他的人和兽也跟着手忙脚乱地下了水，湖面上顿时水花飞溅。冒泡的湖水并不像大家原先想象的那样冰冷彻骨（帕塞尔感受最深），倒是有几分宜人的凉爽。他们都朝那个大瀑布游过去。

“这太疯狂了，”尤斯塔斯对爱德蒙说。

“我知道。但是——”爱德蒙说。

“这不神奇吗？”露西说，“你有没有注意到，这里你根本感觉不到害怕，即便想害怕都害怕不起来。你试试。”

“上帝啊，真的是这样，”尤斯塔斯作了尝试后说。

珠厄儿第一个游到了瀑布底下，提里安就紧跟在他后面。吉尔游在最后面，因此，整个过程她比别人看得更清楚。她看见一个白晃晃的东西正稳稳地在瀑布中往上移动，那白晃晃的东西就是独角兽。你说不清他是在游泳还是在攀爬，但确实在移动，并越升越高。他那尖尖的独角将头上的水分开，形成两股彩虹般的水流披挂在肩膀上。他的下方是提里安国王。他挥动着手和脚，好像在游泳，但目标却在上方：就像在房间里往上爬一堵墙。

看上去最滑稽的是那几只狗了。刚才一路奔跑时，他们没喘过一口气，这会儿却又是呛水又是打喷嚏。因为他们总想不停地吠叫，而每次吠叫，又难免弄得满嘴满鼻都是水。吉尔还没来得及将这一切看真切，她自己已经游上了瀑布。这种事在我们所在的这个世界是绝对不可能发生的，即便你不被湖水淹死，这时也一定会被击打在无数的尖石上的可怕激流撕得粉碎；但在那个世界，你却能实现这样的奇迹。你不断地往上攀登，来自瀑布的各种反光照耀在你的身上，形形色色的彩石又从水幕里折射出光辉，这时你简直就像顺着一根光柱往上爬——而且越爬越高，如果你心怀恐惧，那高度一定会把你吓得灵魂出窍。但在这里，你只觉得荣耀和激动。最后，你来到了大水由此涌向山顶的那条美妙的、光滑的、绿莹莹的弯道，发现自己已在瀑布上方平缓的水流中。激流被你甩在了身后，你居然是一个逆流而上的神奇的游泳高手。不久，他们全都上了岸，虽然湿淋淋的，但心里快活。

此时他们的眼前是一个长长的河谷和巍峨的雪山；那雪山就映衬在蓝天中，离他们不远。

“向着更高，向着更远，”珠厄儿呼喊着，大家即刻又出发了。

他们现在已经离开了纳尼亚，登上了西部荒野，那是提里安、彼得，甚至老鹰都没有到过的地方。但迪格雷勋爵和波莉夫人来过。“你还记得吗？你还记得吗？”他们两人在交谈——说话的语调很平稳，一点儿也不气喘，尽管这一路上他们全都跑得比箭还快。

“哟，勋爵，”提里安说，“根据记载，你们两人是在这个世界刚开创那一天来到这里的，这都是真的吗？”

“当然，”迪格雷说，“我觉得事情好像就发生在昨天。”

“是骑飞马来的？”提里安问，“这个说法对吗？”

“当然对，”迪格雷说。

这时狗儿们又吠叫起来，“快，快！”

他们于是加快步伐，那速度更像飞行，而不是奔跑，甚至头上的老鹰也没能赶到他们前面去。他们穿过一个又一个蜿蜒起伏的山谷，登上陡峭的山坡，以更快的速度奔下山坡，随后顺着河流而上，不时地越过或掠过山间湖泊，仿佛就是有生命的快艇。最后他们来到一个长长的湖泊的尽头，蓝蓝的湖水看上去就像一颗硕大的蓝宝石。眼前是一座闪光的绿色小山。山的四周像金字塔的边沿那样陡峭，环绕山顶的是一堵绿色的围墙，茂密的树木从围墙上冒出，叶子如银，果实似金。

“向着更高，向着更远！”独角兽在呼喊，谁也不甘落后。他们直接朝山脚奔去。攀登那座小山时，他们就像冲上海湾后飞出岩壁的一个个海浪。尽管那里陡峭得像屋脊，光滑得像滚木球场，但谁也没有摔倒。

直到登上小山山顶，他们才放慢脚步。他们发现那里有一道金光闪闪的大门。一时间，谁也不敢上前试试这门是否能打开。他们此时的迟疑，就像面对那颗神奇的果实——“我们敢吗？这样做对吗？这门能为我们打开吗？”

就在他们站着犹豫不决时，从墙内花园里的某个地方传来了悠扬而甜美的号角声，大门打开了。

提里安屏住呼吸，想看看出来的是谁。出来的是他最意料不到的：一只毛发光滑、眼睛明亮、会说话的小老鼠，头上戴着一个项圈，上面插了根红翎毛，左爪按在一把长剑上。

他上前鞠了一躬，那是非常漂亮的一躬，然后便用尖细的嗓子说：

“以狮王的名义，欢迎你们。向着更高，向着更远。”

提里安随即看见至尊王彼得、爱德蒙国王、露西女王都跑了过去，向他鞠躬致敬，嘴里齐声欢呼，“里比契帕！”提里安惊讶得呼吸都急促了；他知道，他现在见到的正是纳尼亚的大英雄老鼠里比契帕，他曾经参加过贝鲁纳大战，后来又跟随航海者凯斯宾国王到过世界的尽头。但他来不及想得太多，便感觉到自己被两条强壮的胳膊抱住，有胡子在吻他的脸，并听见一个非常熟悉的声音在说：

“怎么样，小伙子？我的胡子是不是比上次吻你时更密更长了？”

亲吻他的正是他自己的父亲厄廉国王，但不是最后一次见到时的模样，当时他与巨人作战受了重伤，人们把他送回家，他的脸色十分苍白；也不是提里安所记得的他晚年时的模样，那时他是一个白发苍苍的战士。现在的他既年轻又快活，就像提里安孩提时在凯尔帕拉维尔王宫的花园里，在夏日的黄昏上床睡觉前一起嬉戏时的那个父亲的模样。晚餐时经常吃的牛奶和面包的香味又回来了。

珠厄儿这时自言自语道：“我要让他们父子再谈一会儿，然后再过去跟厄廉国王打招呼。当我小的时候，他给我吃过许多红艳艳的大苹果。”但不一会儿，他就有其他的事需要考虑了。这时大门那边出来了一匹强壮而高贵的马，在他面前独角兽也相形见绌了。这是一匹长翅膀的马。他一眼看见了迪格雷勋爵和波莉夫人，大声地嘶叫起来，“嘿，表兄表妹！”迪格雷和波莉同时欢呼起来，“弗兰奇！善良的弗兰奇！”随即跑过去亲吻他。

老鼠又在催促他们进门去。大家于是穿过金色的大门，来自花园的芳香扑鼻而来，阳光和树荫交融在一起，给他们带来宜人的凉爽。他们行走在缀满鲜花、富有弹性的草地上。他们的第一个印象是，这个花园远比外面所看见的大得多。但谁也没时间考虑这个问题，因为人们已从四面八方围拢来迎接新来者。

你曾经听说过的每一个人（如果你知道这些国家的历史）似乎都在这里了。他们中有猫头鹰格林费瑟、沼地怪人普德格伦、驱魔者瑞廉国王、瑞廉的母亲星星之女、瑞廉的祖父凯斯宾本人。凯斯宾身边有德里尼安勋爵、伯尼勋爵、小矮人特鲁姆普金、善良的獾特鲁夫亨特、人头马格伦斯多姆，以及上百位参加过营救大战的英雄。然后从另一边过来的有阿钦兰国王科尔、科尔的父亲鲁那国王、鲁那的王后阿拉维丝、英勇的王子霹雳拳手科林、战马勃里和母马赫温。再以后——令提里安感到最不可思议的是——他们中还有来自遥远的过去的两只善良的河狸和羊怪图姆纳斯。大家相互问候、接吻、握手，说着一些旧日的笑话（你很难想象一个旧日的笑话沉睡了五六百年后再拿出来说会多么的有趣）。这一大群人和动物说笑着来到果园的中心。凤凰栖息在一棵树上，低头望着他们。树底下有两个御座，上面坐着国王和王后，他们是那么的高贵、俊美，每个人都上前朝他们鞠躬致意。他们是值得所有的人鞠躬致意的，因为他们就是弗兰克国王和王后海伦，所有纳尼亚王国和阿钦兰王国的国王共同的祖先。提里安此时所感受的荣耀就像你被带到亚当和夏娃面前一样。

大约半小时以后——也可能是五百年以后，因为时间在那里是不存在的——露西跟她的老朋友羊怪图姆纳斯站在一起，从花园的围墙朝下张望，看见整个纳尼亚就展现在他们下方。只有在你居高临下的时候，你才会发现这座小山比你原先想象的要高得多：数千英尺以下，全都是闪闪发光的悬崖峭壁；那个下方世界的树木看上去只有盐粒般大小。露西回转身，背对着墙壁，重新审视起这个花园。

“我看出来了，”她若有所思地说，“我现在看出来了，这个花园就像那个马厩。它的内部显然比外部大得多。”

“这当然，夏娃的女儿，”羊怪说，“你越向更高更远处走，一切都会变得更大。内部是比外部大。”

露西仔细观察着这个花园，看出它其实根本不是一个花园，而是一个有河流、树林、大海和高山的整个世界。它们对她来说并不陌生；她全都认识这一切。

“我知道了，”她说，“这也是纳尼亚，但它比下方的那个纳尼亚更真实、更美丽，就像下面的纳尼亚比马厩外的纳尼亚更真实、更美丽一样。我明白了……这是世界中的世界，纳尼亚中的纳尼亚……”

“说得对，”图姆纳斯说，“就像一个洋葱头，不同的只是，这个洋葱头你越往里剥，里面的一层却比外面的一层大。”

露西这里看看，那里看看，很快发现了另一件新鲜而美妙的事：不管她看什么，不管那物体离她多远，只要她目不转睛地盯着它，它就变得很清晰、离她很近，就像用望远镜观察一样。她还能看见整个南部沙漠和沙漠以外的塔什邦城。朝东张望，她还能看见坐落在海滨的凯尔帕拉维尔王宫以及她住过的那间房子的窗口！

再从大海望出去，她还能看见一个接一个的小岛一直延伸到世界的尽头。越过尽头的那座高山，就是人们所说的阿斯兰的国度了。但现在她知道，那也不过是将整个世界连接在一起的那条山脉大链条的一部分。这条大链条此刻就在她眼前，离她很近。

然后她又朝左边望去，她看见一堆色彩斑斓的东西，他们与它之间隔着一条深沟，一开始她还以为那是一片云彩。等她定睛看时，才知它根本不是云彩，而是一片土地。当她再将目光注视在某一个特定的地方时，她禁不住叫了起来，“彼得！爱德蒙！快来看！快来。”他们过来了，他们的眼睛也像她那样睁得大大的。

“哇！”彼得惊叫了起来，“那是英格兰。就是那间房子——柯克教授在乡下的旧房子，我们的历险就是从那里开始的！”

“我原以为那房子已经被毁了呢，”爱德蒙说。

“它是被毁了，”羊怪说，“我们现在看到的是英格兰中的英格兰，那是真正的英格兰，就像这里是真正的纳尼亚一样。在那个内部的英格兰里，美好的事物是不会毁灭的。”

他们的目光突然又转向另一个地点，彼得、爱德蒙和露西这时已惊讶得喘不过气来了。他们高喊着，开始向那边挥手：因为他们看见他们的父母也在又大又深的山谷那边向他们挥手。这情景就像你看见有人在一艘大船的甲板上向你挥手，而你正等待在码头上迎接他一样。

“我们怎样才能到达他们那里呢？”露西说。

“这倒很容易，”图姆纳斯说，“那个地方和这个地方——都是真正的乡野——都是从阿斯兰这座大山脉里冒出来的一个小山岗。我们只要沿着山脊走过去，一直朝着上方，一直朝着远处走，就能到达那里了。听！弗兰克国王的号角吹响了，我们得上去了。”

他们很快都走在了一起——那是一支浩浩荡荡、荣光闪耀的队伍——向着更高的山峰，向着比我们这个世界所能见到的任何山峰都高的山峰前进。但这些高山上没有雪；只有森林、绿地、美丽的果园和水花飞溅的瀑布，它们一个连着一个，永远往上伸展。他们脚下的土地逐渐变得狭窄起来，左右两侧都出现了一个深谷；跨过深谷的那片土地就是英格兰，它离他们越来越近了。

他们前面的光辉越来越强烈。露西发现引导他们前进的那一排排绚丽多彩的悬崖就像巨人的楼梯。这以后露西便忘记了其他的一切，因为阿斯兰自己这时正朝他们走来，他从一块悬崖跳到另一块悬崖，就像流溢着力量和美的有生命的瀑布。

阿斯兰第一个招呼的是驴子帕塞尔。当帕塞尔向阿斯兰走过去时，你会觉得天底下再没有比他更虚弱、更愚蠢的驴了，他站在阿斯兰身边，看上去渺小得就像圣伯纳德大教堂边上的一只小猫。狮王低下头，跟帕塞尔悄悄说了什么，帕塞尔听了后即刻耷拉下他的长耳朵；随后阿斯兰又说了什么，他的耳朵又重新竖了起来。但大家都没听见阿斯兰究竟跟驴说了什么话。

阿斯兰这时朝他们转过身来，说：“你们看上去并没有我原先设想的那样高兴啊。”

露西说：“我们很担心你会打发我们走，阿斯兰。你曾经多次把我们送回到我们自己的世界。”

“用不着担心了，”阿斯兰说，“你们还不知道吗？”

大家的心都在怦怦地跳。一个大胆的希望也随即升起。

“确实发生了一次火车事故，”阿斯兰轻声说，“你们的父母，包括你们大家都死了——按你们通常的说法，是去了虚幻世界。好了，学期已经结束，假期开始了。梦做完了，现在已是早晨了。”

当他说这话时，他已不像一只狮子那样看着他们。这以后发生的事太伟大、太美妙了，简直无法一一描述。对我们来说，这已是故事的结尾；可以如实相告的是，他们后来的生活永远幸福。对他们而言，他们最真实的生活才刚刚开始。他们在这个世界和在纳尼亚的生活只是一本书的封皮和扉页，那个伟大的故事的第一章现在才开始谱写，可惜世人是无缘阅读的。那个伟大的故事永远进行着，后一章总比前一章更精彩。





Chapter 1　BY CALDRON POOL


In the last days of Narnia, far up to the west beyond Lantern Waste and close beside the great waterfall, there lived an Ape. He was so old that no one could remember when he had first come to live in those parts, and he was the cleverest, ugliest, most wrinkled Ape you can imagine. He had a little house, built of wood and thatched with leaves, up in the fork of a great tree, and his name was Shift. There were very few Talking Beasts or Men or Dwarfs, or people of any sort, in that part of the wood, but Shift had one friend and neighbour who was a donkey called Puzzle. At least they both said they were friends, but from the way things went on you might have thought Puzzle was more like Shift's servant than his friend. He did all the work. When they went together to the river, Shift filled the big skin bottles with water but it was Puzzle who carried them back. When they wanted anything from the towns further down the river it was Puzzle who went down with empty panniers on his back and came back with the panniers full and heavy. And all the nicest things that Puzzle brought back were eaten by Shift; for as Shift said, “You see, Puzzle, I can't eat grass and thistles like you, so it's only fair I should make it up in other ways.” And Puzzle always said, “Of course, Shift, of course. I see that.”

Puzzle never complained, because he knew that Shift was far cleverer than himself and he thought it was very kind of Shift to be friends with him at all. And if ever Puzzle did try to argue about anything, Shift would always say, “Now, Puzzle, I understand what needs to be done better than you. You know you're not clever, Puzzle.” And Puzzle always said, “No, Shift. It's quite true. I'm not clever.” Then he would sigh and do whatever Shift had said.

One morning early in the year the pair of them were out walking along the shore of Caldron Pool. Caldron Pool is the big pool right under the cliffs at the western end of Narnia. The great waterfall pours down into it with a noise like everlasting thunder, and the River of Narnia flows out on the other side. The waterfall keeps the Pool always dancing and bubbling and churning round and round as if it were on the boil, and that of course is how it got its name of Caldron Pool. It is liveliest in the early spring when the waterfall is swollen with all the snow that has melted off the mountains from up beyond Narnia in the Western Wild from which the river comes. And as they looked at Caldron Pool Shift suddenly pointed with his dark, skinny finger and said,

“Look! What's that?”

“What's what?” said Puzzle.

“That yellow thing that's just come down the waterfall. Look! There it is again, it's floating. We must find out what it is.”

“Must we?” said Puzzle.

“Of course we must,” said Shift. “It may be something useful. Just hop into the Pool like a good fellow and fish it out. Then we can have a proper look at it.”

“Hop into the Pool?” said Puzzle, twitching his long ears.

“Well how are we to get it if you don't?” said the Ape.

“But—but,” said Puzzle, “wouldn't it be better if you went in? Because, you see, it's you who wants to know what it is, and I don't much. And you've got hands, you see. You're as good as a Man or a Dwarf when it comes to catching hold of things. I've only got hoofs.”

“Really, Puzzle,” said Shift, “I didn't think you'd ever say a thing like that. I didn't think it of you, really.”

“Why, what have I said wrong?” said the Ass, speaking in rather a humble voice, for he saw that Shift was very deeply offended. “All I meant was—”

“Wanting me to go into the water,” said the Ape. “As if you didn't know perfectly well what weak chests Apes always have and how easily they catch cold! Very well. I will go in. I'm feeling cold enough already in this cruel wind. But I'll go in. I shall probably die. Then you'll be sorry.” And Shift's voice sounded as if he was just going to burst into tears.

“Please don't, please don't, please don't,” said Puzzle, half braying, and half talking. “I never meant anything of the sort, Shift, really I didn't. You know how stupid I am and how I can't think of more than one thing at a time. I'd forgotten about your weak chest. Of course I'll go in. You mustn't think of doing it yourself. Promise me you won't, Shift.”

So Shift promised, and Puzzle went cloppety-clop on his four hoofs round the rocky edge of the Pool to find a place where he could get in. Quite apart from the cold it was no joke getting into that quivering and foaming water, and Puzzle had to stand and shiver for a whole minute before he made up his mind to do it. But then Shift called out from behind him and said: “Perhaps I'd better do it after all, Puzzle.” And when Puzzle heard that he said, “No, no. You promised. I'm in now,” and in he went.

A great mass of foam got him in the face and filled his mouth with water and blinded him. Then he went under altogether for a few seconds, and when he came up again he was in quite another part of the Pool. Then the swirl caught him and carried him round and round and faster and faster till it took him right under the waterfall itself, and the force of the water plunged him down, deep down, so that he thought he would never be able to hold his breath till he came up again. And when he had come up and when at last he got somewhere near the thing he was trying to catch, it sailed away from him till it too got under the fall and was forced down to the bottom. When it came up again it was further from him than ever.

But at last, when he was almost tired to death, and bruised all over and numb with cold, he succeeded in gripping the thing with his teeth. And out he came carrying it in front of him and getting his front hoofs tangled up in it, for it was as big as a large hearthrug, and it was very heavy and cold and slimy.

He flung it down in front of Shift and stood dripping and shivering and trying to get his breath back. But the Ape never looked at him or asked him how he felt. The Ape was too busy going round and round the Thing and spreading it out and patting it and smelling it. Then a wicked gleam came into his eye and he said: “It is a lion's skin.”

“Ee—auh—auh—oh, is it?” gasped Puzzle.

“Now I wonder…I wonder…I wonder,” said Shift to himself, for he was thinking very hard.

“I wonder who killed the poor lion,” said Puzzle presently. “It ought to be buried. We must have a funeral.”

“Oh, it wasn't a Talking Lion,” said Shift. “You needn't bother about that. There are no Talking Beasts up beyond the Falls, up in the Western Wild. This skin must have belonged to a dumb, wild lion.”

This, by the way, was true. A Hunter, a Man, had killed and skinned this lion somewhere up in the Western Wild several months before. But that doesn't come into this story.

“All the same, Shift,” said Puzzle, “even if the skin only belonged to a dumb, wild lion, oughtn't we to give it a decent burial? I mean, aren't all lions rather—well, rather solemn? Because of you know Who. Don't you see?”

“Don't you start getting ideas into your head, Puzzle,” said Shift. “Because, you know, thinking isn't your strong point. We'll make this skin into a fine warm winter coat for you.”

“Oh, I don't think I'd like that,” said the Donkey. “It would look—I mean, the other Beasts might think—that is to say, I shouldn't feel—”

“What are you talking about?” said Shift, scratching himself the wrong way up as Apes do.

“I don't think it would be respectful to the Great Lion, to Aslan himself, if an ass like me went about dressed up in a lion-skin,” said Puzzle.

“Now don't stand arguing, please,” said Shift. “What does an ass like you know about things of that sort? You know you're no good at thinking, Puzzle, so why don't you let me do your thinking for you? Why don't you treat me as I treat you? I don't think I can do everything. I know you're better at some things than I am. That's why I let you go into the Pool; I knew you'd do it better than me. But why can't I have my turn when it comes to something I can do and you can't? Am I never to be allowed to do anything? Do be fair. Turn and turn about.”

“Oh, well, of course, if you put it that way,” said Puzzle.

“I tell you what,” said Shift. “You'd better take a good brisk trot down river as far as Chippingford and see if they have any oranges or bananas.”

“But I'm so tired, Shift,” pleaded Puzzle.

“Yes, but you are very cold and wet,” said the Ape. “You want something to warm you up. A brisk trot would be just the thing. Besides, it's market day at Chippingford today.” And then of course Puzzle said he would go.

As soon as he was alone Shift went shambling along, sometimes on two paws and sometimes on four, till he reached his own tree. Then he swung himself up from branch to branch, chattering and grinning all the time, and went into his little house. He found needle and thread and a big pair of scissors there; for he was a clever Ape and the Dwarfs had taught him how to sew. He put the ball of thread (it was very thick stuff, more like cord than thread) into his mouth so that his cheek bulged out as if he were sucking a big bit of toffee. He held the needle between his lips and took the scissors in his left paw. Then he came down the tree and shambled across to the lion-skin. He squatted down and got to work.

He saw at once that the body of the lion-skin would be too long for Puzzle and its neck too short. So he cut a good piece out of the body and used it to make a long collar for Puzzle's long neck. Then he cut off the head and sewed the collar in between the head and the shoulders. He put threads on both sides of the skin so that it would tie up under Puzzle's chest and stomach. Every now and then a bird would pass overhead and Shift would stop his work, looking anxiously up. He did not want anyone to see what he was doing. But none of the birds he saw were Talking Birds, so it didn't matter.

Late in the afternoon Puzzle came back. He was not trotting but only plodding patiently along, the way donkeys do.

“There weren't any oranges,” he said, “and there weren't any bananas. And I'm very tired.” He lay down.

“Come and try on your beautiful new lion-skin coat,” said Shift.

“Oh bother that old skin,” said Puzzle. “I'll try it on in the morning. I'm too tired tonight.”

“You are unkind, Puzzle,” said Shift. “If you're tired what do you think I am? All day long, while you've been having a lovely refreshing walk down the valley, I've been working hard to make you a coat. My paws are so tired I can hardly hold these scissors. And you won't say thank you—and you won't even look at the coat—and you don't care—and—and—”

“My dear Shift,” said Puzzle getting up at once, “I am so sorry. I've been horrid. Of course I'd love to try it on. And it looks simply splendid. Do try it on me at once. Please do.”

“Well, stand still then,” said the Ape. The skin was very heavy for him to lift, but in the end, with a lot of pulling and pushing and puffing and blowing, he got it on to the donkey. He tied it underneath Puzzle's body and he tied the legs to Puzzle's legs and the tail to Puzzle's tail. A good deal of Puzzle's grey nose and face could be seen through the open mouth of the lion's head. No one who had ever seen a real lion would have been taken in for a moment. But if someone who had never seen a lion looked at Puzzle in his lion-skin he just might mistake him for a lion, if he didn't come too close, and if the light was not too good, and if Puzzle didn't let out a bray and didn't make any noise with his hoofs.

“You look wonderful, wonderful,” said the Ape. “If anyone saw you now, they'd think you were Aslan, the Great Lion, himself.”

“That would be dreadful,” said Puzzle.

“No it wouldn't,” said Shift. “Everyone would do whatever you told them.”

“But I don't want to tell them anything.”

“But you think of the good we could do!” said Shift. “You'd have me to advise you, you know. I'd think of sensible orders for you to give. And everyone would have to obey us, even the King himself. We would set everything right in Narnia.”

“But isn't everything right already?” said Puzzle.

“What!” cried Shift. “Everything right?—when there are no oranges or bananas?”

“Well, you know,” said Puzzle, “there aren't many people—in fact, I don't think there's anyone but yourself who wants those sort of things.”

“There's sugar too,” said Shift.

“H'm yes,” said the Ass. “It would be nice if there was more sugar.”

“Well then, that's settled,” said the Ape. “You will pretend to be Aslan, and I'll tell you what to say.”

“No, no, no,” said Puzzle. “Don't say such dreadful things. It would be wrong, Shift. I maybe not very clever but I know that much. What would become of us if the real Aslan turned up?”

“I expect he'd be very pleased,” said Shift. “Probably he sent us the lion-skin on purpose, so that we could set things to right. Anyway, he never does turn up, you know. Not nowadays.”

At that moment there came a great thunderclap right overhead and the ground trembled with a small earthquake. Both the animals lost their balance and were flung on their faces.

“There!” gasped Puzzle, as soon as he had breath to speak. “It's a sign, a warning. I knew we were doing something dreadfully wicked. Take this wretched skin off me at once.”

“No, no,” said the Ape (whose mind worked very quickly). “It's a sign the other way. I was just going to say that if the real Aslan, as you call him, meant us to go on with this, he would send us a thunderclap and an earth-tremor. It was just on the tip of my tongue, only the sign itself came before I could get the words out. You've got to do it now, Puzzle. And please don't let us have any more arguing. You know you don't understand these things. What could a donkey know about signs?”





Chapter 2　THE RASHNESS OF THE KING


About three weeks later the last of the Kings of Narnia sat under the great oak which grew beside the door of his little hunting lodge, where he often stayed for ten days or so in the pleasant spring weather. It was a low, thatched building not far from the Eastern end of Lantern Waste and some way above the meeting of the two rivers. He loved to live there simply and at ease, away from the state and pomp of Cair Paravel, the royal city. His name was King Tirian, and he was between twenty and twenty-five years old; his shoulders were already broad and strong and his limbs full of hard muscle, but his beard was still scanty. He had blue eyes and a fearless, honest face.

There was no one with him that spring morning except his dearest friend, Jewel the Unicorn. They loved each other like brothers and each had saved the other's life in the wars. The lordly beast stood close beside the King's chair, with its neck bent round polishing its blue horn against the creamy whiteness of its flank.

“I cannot set myself to any work or sport today, Jewel,” said the King. “I can think of nothing but this wonderful news. Think you we shall hear any more of it today?”

“They are the most wonderful tidings ever heard in our days or our fathers' or our grandfathers' days, Sire,” said Jewel, “if they are true.”

“How can they choose but be true?” said the King. “It is more than a week ago that the first birds came flying over us saying, Aslan is here, Aslan has come to Narnia again. And after that it was the squirrels. They had not seen him, but they said it was certain he was in the woods. Then came the Stag. He said he had seen him with his own eyes, a great way off, by moonlight, in Lantern Waste. Then came that dark Man with the beard, the merchant from Calormen. The Calormenes care nothing for Aslan as we do; but the man spoke of it as a thing beyond doubt. And there was the Badger last night; he too had seen Aslan.”

“Indeed, Sire,” answered Jewel, “I believe it all. If I seem not to, it is only that my joy is too great to let my belief settle itself. It is almost too beautiful to believe.”

“Yes,” said the King with a great sigh, almost a shiver, of delight. “It is beyond all that I ever hoped for in all my life.”

“Listen!” said Jewel, putting his head on one side and cocking his ears forward.

“What is it?” asked the King.

“Hoofs, Sire,” said Jewel. “A galloping horse. A very heavy horse. It must be one of the Centaurs. And look, there he is.”

A great, golden bearded Centaur, with man's sweat on his forehead and horse's sweat on his chestnut flanks, dashed up to the King, stopped, and bowed low. “Hail, King,” it cried in a voice as deep as a bull's.

“Ho, there!” said the King, looking over his shoulder towards the door of the hunting lodge. “A bowl of wine for the noble Centaur. Welcome, Roonwit. When you have found your breath you shall tell us your errand.”

A page came out of the house carrying a great wooden bowl, curiously carved, and handed it to the Centaur. The Centaur raised the bowl and said,

“I drink first to Aslan and truth, Sire, and secondly to your Majesty.”

He finished the wine (enough for six strong men) at one draught and handed the empty bowl back to the page.

“Now, Roonwit,” said the King. “Do you bring us more news of Aslan?”

Roonwit looked very grave, frowning a little.

“Sire,” he said. “You know how long I have lived and studied the stars; for we Centaurs live longer than you Men, and even longer than your kind, Unicorn. Never in all my days have I seen such terrible things written in the skies as there have been nightly since this year began. The stars say nothing of the coming of Aslan, nor of peace, nor of joy. I know by my art that there have not been such disastrous conjunctions of the planets for five hundred years. It was already in my mind to come and warn your Majesty that some great evil hangs over Narnia. But last night the rumour reached me that Aslan is abroad in Narnia. Sire, do not believe this tale. It cannot be. The stars never lie, but Men and Beasts do. If Aslan were really coming to Narnia the sky would have foretold it. If he were really come, all the most gracious stars would be assembled in his honour. It is all a lie.”

“A lie!” said the King fiercely. “What creature in Narnia or all the world would dare to lie on such a matter?” And, without knowing it, he laid his hand on his sword hilt.

“That I know not, Lord King,” said the Centaur. “But I know there are liars on earth; there are none among the stars.”

“I wonder,” said Jewel, “whether Aslan might not come though all the stars foretold otherwise. He is not the slave of the stars but their Maker. Is it not said in all the old stories that He is not a tame lion.”

“Well said, well said, Jewel,” cried the King. “Those are the very words: not a tame lion. It comes in many tales.”

Roonwit had just raised his hand and was leaning forward to say something very earnestly to the King when all three of them turned their heads to listen to a wailing sound that was quickly drawing nearer. The wood was so thick to the West of them that they could not see the newcomer yet. But they could soon hear the words.

“Woe, woe, woe!” called the voice. “Woe for my brothers and sisters! Woe for the holy trees! The woods are laid waste. The axe is loosed against us. We are being felled. Great trees are falling, falling, falling.”

With the last “falling” the speaker came in sight. She was like a woman but so tall that her head was on a level with the Centaur's yet she was like a tree too. It is hard to explain if you have never seen a Dryad but quite unmistakable once you have—something different in the colour, the voice, and the hair. King Tirian and the two Beasts knew at once that she was the nymph of a beech tree.

“Justice, Lord King!” she cried. “Come to our aid. Protect your people. They are felling us in Lantern Waste. Forty great trunks of my brothers and sisters are already on the ground.”

“What, Lady! Felling Lantern Waste? Murdering the talking trees?” cried the King, leaping to his feet and drawing his sword. “How dare they? And who dares it? Now by the Mane of Aslan—”

“A-a-a-h,” gasped the Dryad shuddering as if in pain—shuddering time after time as if under repeated blows. Then all at once she fell sideways as suddenly as if both her feet had been cut from under her. For a second they saw her lying dead on the grass and then she vanished. They knew what had happened. Her tree, miles away, had been cut down.

For a moment the King's grief and anger were so great that he could not speak. Then he said:

“Come, friends. We must go up river and find the villains who have done this, with all the speed we may. I will leave not one of them alive.”

“Sire, with a good will,” said Jewel.

But Roonwit said, “Sire, be wary in your just wrath. There are strange doings on foot. If there should be rebels in arms further up the valley, we three are too few to meet them. If it would please you to wait while—”

“I will not wait the tenth part of a second,” said the King. “But while Jewel and I go forward, do you gallop as hard as you may to Cair Paravel. Here is my ring for your token. Get me a score of men-at-arms, all well mounted, and a score of Talking Dogs, and ten Dwarfs (let them all be fell archers), and a Leopard or so, and Stonefoot the Giant. Bring all these after us as quickly as may be.”

“With a good will, Sire,” said Roonwit. And at once he turned and galloped Eastward down the valley.

The King strode on at a great pace, sometimes muttering to himself and sometimes clenching his fists. Jewel walked beside him, saying nothing; so there was no sound between them but the faint jingle of a rich gold chain that hung round the Unicorn's neck and the noise of two feet and four hoofs.

They soon reached the River and turned up it where there was a grassy road: they had the water on their left and the forest on their right. Soon after that they came to the place where the ground grew rougher and thick wood came down to the water's edge. The road, what there was of it, now ran on the Southern bank and they had to ford the River to reach it. It was up to Tirian's arm-pits, but Jewel (who had four legs and was therefore steadier) kept on his right so as to break the force of the current, and Tirian put his strong arm round the Unicorn's strong neck and they both got safely over. The King was still so angry that he hardly noticed the cold of the water. But of course he dried his sword very carefully on the shoulder of his cloak, which was the only dry part of him, as soon as they came to shore.

They were now going Westward with the River on their right and Lantern Waste straight ahead of them. They had not gone more than a mile when they both stopped and both spoke at the same moment. The King said “What have we here?” and Jewel said “Look!”

“It is a raft,” said King Tirian.

And so it was. Half a dozen splendid tree-trunks, all newly cut and newly lopped of their branches, had been lashed together to make a raft, and were gliding swiftly down the river. On the front of the raft there was a water rat with a pole to steer it.

“Hey! Water-Rat! What are you about?” cried the King.

“Taking logs down to sell to the Calormenes, Sire,” said the Rat, touching his ear as he might have touched his cap if he had had one.

“Calormenes!” thundered Tirian. “What do you mean? Who gave order for these trees to be felled?”

The River flows so swiftly at that time of the year that the raft had already glided past the King and Jewel. But the Water-Rat looked back over its shoulder and shouted out:

“The Lion's orders, Sire. Aslan himself.” He added something more but they couldn't hear it.

The King and the Unicorn stared at one another and both looked more frightened than they had ever been in any battle.

“Aslan,” said the King at last, in a very low voice. “Aslan. Could it be true? Could he be felling the holy trees and murdering the Dryads?”

“Unless the Dryads have all done something dreadfully wrong—” murmured Jewel.

“But selling them to Calormenes!” said the King. “Is it possible?”

“I don't know,” said Jewel miserably. “He's not a tame lion.”

“Well,” said the King at last, “we must go on and take the adventure that comes to us.”

“It is the only thing left for us to do, Sire,” said the Unicorn. He did not see at the moment how foolish it was for two of them to go on alone; nor did the King. They were too angry to think clearly. But much evil came of their rashness in the end.

Suddenly the King leaned hard on his friend's neck and bowed his head.

“Jewel,” he said, “what lies before us? Horrible thoughts arise in my heart. If we had died before today we should have been happy.”

“Yes,” said Jewel. “We have lived too long. The worst thing in the world has come upon us.” They stood like that for a minute or two and then went on.

Before long they could hear the hack-hack-hack of axes falling on timber, though they could see nothing yet because there was a rise of the ground in front of them. When they had reached the top of it they could see right into Lantern Waste itself. And the King's face turned white when he saw it.

Right through the middle of that ancient forest—that forest where the trees of gold and of silver had once grown and where a child from our world had once planted the Tree of Protection—a broad lane had already been opened. It was a hideous lane like a raw gash in the land, full of muddy ruts where felled trees had been dragged down to the river. There was a great crowd of people at work, and a cracking of whips, and horses tugging and straining as they dragged at the logs. The first thing that struck the King and the Unicorn was that about half the people in the crowd were not Talking Beasts but Men. The next thing was that these men were not the fair-haired men of Narnia: they were dark, bearded men from Calormen, that great and cruel country that lies beyond Archenland across the desert to the south.

There was no reason, of course, why one should not meet a Calormene or two in Narnia—a merchant or an ambassador—for there was peace between Narnia and Calormen in those days. But Tirian could not understand why there were so many of them: nor why they were cutting down a Narnian forest. He grasped his sword tighter and rolled his cloak round his left arm. They came quickly down among the men.

Two Calormenes were driving a horse which was harnessed to a log. Just as the King reached them the log had got stuck in a bad muddy place.

“Get on, son of sloth! Pull, you lazy pig!” cried the Calormenes, cracking their whips. The horse was already straining himself as hard as he could; his eyes were red and he was covered with foam.

“Work, lazy brute,” shouted one of the Calormenes: and as he spoke he struck the horse savagely with his whip. It was then that the really dreadful thing happened.

Up till now Tirian had taken it for granted that the horses which the Calormenes were driving were their own horses; dumb, witless animals like the horses of our own world. And though he hated to see even a dumb horse overdriven, he was of course thinking more about the murder of the Trees. It had never crossed his mind that anyone would dare to harness one of the free Talking Horses of Narnia, much less to use a whip on it. But as that savage blow fell the horse reared up and said, half screaming:

“Fool and tyrant! Do you not see I am doing all I can?”

When Tirian knew that the Horse was one of his own Narnians, there came over him and over Jewel such a rage that they did not know what they were doing. The King's sword went up, the Unicorn's horn went down. They rushed forward together. Next moment both the Calormenes lay dead, the one beheaded by Tirian's sword and the other gored through the heart by Jewel's horn.





Chapter 3　THE APE IN ITS GLORY


“Master Horse, Master Horse,” said Tirian as he hastily cut its traces, “how came these aliens to enslave you? Is Narnia conquered? Has there been a battle?”

“No, Sire,” panted the horse, “Aslan is here. It is all by his orders. He has commanded—”

“Ware danger, King,” said Jewel. Tirian looked up and saw that Calormenes (mixed with a few Talking Beasts) were beginning to run towards them from every direction. The two dead men had died without a cry and so it had taken a moment before the rest of the crowd knew what had happened. But now they did. Most of them had naked scimitars in their hands.

“Quick. On my back,” said Jewel.

The King flung himself astride of his old friend who turned and galloped away. He changed direction twice or thrice as soon as they were out of sight of their enemies, crossed a stream, and shouted without slackening his pace, “Whither away, Sire? To Cair Paravel?”

“Hold hard, friend,” said Tirian. “Let me off.” He slid off the Unicorn's back and faced him.

“Jewel,” said the King. “We have done a dreadful deed.”

“We were sorely provoked,” said Jewel.

“But to leap on them unawares—without defying them while they were unarmed—faugh! We are two murderers, Jewel. I am dishonoured forever.”

Jewel drooped his head. He too was ashamed.

“And then,” said the King, “the Horse said it was by Aslan's orders. The Rat said the same. They all say Aslan is here. How if it were true?”

“But, Sire, how could Aslan be commanding such dreadful things?”

“He is not a tame lion,” said Tirian. “How should we know what he would do? We, who are murderers. Jewel, I will go back. I will give up my sword and put myself in the hands of these Calormenes and ask that they bring me before Aslan. Let him do justice on me.”

“You will go to your death, then,” said Jewel.

“Do you think I care if Aslan dooms me to death?” said the King. “That would be nothing, nothing at all. Would it not be better to be dead than to have this horrible fear that Aslan has come and is not like the Aslan we have believed in and longed for? It is as if the sun rose one day and were a black sun.”

“I know,” said Jewel. “Or as if you drank water and it were dry water. You are in the right, Sire. This is the end of all things. Let us go and give ourselves up.”

“There is no need for both of us to go.”

“If ever we loved one another, let me go with you now,” said the Unicorn. “If you are dead and if Aslan is not Aslan, what life is left for me?”

They turned and walked back together, shedding bitter tears.

As soon as they came to the place where the work was going on the Calormenes raised a cry and came towards them with their weapons in hand. But the King held out his sword with the hilt towards them and said:

“I who was King of Narnia and am now a dishonoured knight give myself up to the justice of Aslan. Bring me before him.”

“And I give myself up too,” said Jewel.

Then the dark men came round them in a thick crowd, smelling of garlic and onions, their white eyes flashing dreadfully in their brown faces. They put a rope halter round Jewel's neck. They took the King's sword away and tied his hands behind his back. One of the Calormenes, who had a helmet instead of a turban and seemed to be in command, snatched the gold circlet off Tirian's head and hastily put it away somewhere among his clothes. They led the two prisoners uphill to a place where there was a big clearing. And this was what the prisoners saw.

At the centre of the clearing, which was also the highest point of the hill, there was a little hut like a stable, with a thatched roof. Its door was shut. On the grass in front of the door there sat an Ape. Tirian and Jewel, who had been expecting to see Aslan and had heard nothing about an Ape yet, were very bewildered when they saw it. The Ape was of course Shift himself, but he looked ten times uglier than when he lived by Caldron Pool, for he was now dressed up. He was wearing a scarlet jacket which did not fit him very well, having been made for a dwarf. He had Jewelled slippers on his hind paws which would not stay on properly because, as you know, the hind paws of an Ape are really like hands. He wore what seemed to be a paper crown on his head. There was a great pile of nuts beside him and he kept cracking nuts with his jaws and spitting out the shells. And he also kept on pulling up the scarlet jacket to scratch himself.

A great number of Talking Beasts stood facing him, and nearly every face in that crowd looked miserably worried and bewildered. When they saw who the prisoners were they all groaned and whimpered.

“O Lord Shift, mouthpiece of Aslan,” said the chief Calormene. “We bring you prisoners. By our skill and courage and by the permission of the great god Tash we have taken alive these two desperate murderers.”

“Give me that man's sword,” said the Ape. So they took the King's sword and handed it, with the sword-belt and all, to the monkey. And he hung it round his own neck: and it made him look sillier than ever.

“We'll see about those two later,” said the Ape, spitting out a shell in the direction of the two prisoners. “I got some other business first. They can wait. Now listen to me, everyone. The first thing I want to say is about nuts. Where's that Head Squirrel got to?”

“Here, Sir,” said a red squirrel, coming forward and making a nervous little bow.

“Oh you are, are you?” said the Ape with a nasty look. “Now attend to me. I want—I mean, Aslan wants—some more nuts. These you've brought aren't anything like enough. You must bring some more, do you hear? Twice as many. And they've got to be here by sunset tomorrow, and there mustn't be any bad ones or any small ones among them.”

A murmur of dismay ran through the other squirrels, and the Head Squirrel plucked up courage to say:

“Please, would Aslan himself speak to us about it? If we might be allowed to see him—”

“Well you won't,” said the Ape. “He may be very kind (though it's a lot more than most of you deserve) and come out for a few minutes tonight. Then you can all have a look at him. But he will not have you all crowding round him and pestering him with questions. Anything you want to say to him will be passed on through me: if I think it's worth bothering him about. In the meantime all you squirrels had better go and see about the nuts. And make sure they are here by tomorrow evening or, my word! you'll catch it.”

The poor squirrels all scampered away as if a dog were after them. This new order was terrible news for them. The nuts they had carefully hoarded for the winter had nearly all been eaten by now; and of the few that were left they had already given the Ape far more than they could spare.

Then a deep voice—it belonged to a great tusked and shaggy Boar—spoke from another part of the crowd.

“But why can't we see Aslan properly and talk to him?” it said. “When he used to appear in Narnia in the old days everyone could talk to him face to face.”

“Don't you believe it,” said the Ape. “And even if it was true, times have changed. Aslan says he's been far too soft with you before, do you see? Well, he isn't going to be soft any more. He's going to lick you into shape this time. He'll teach you to think he's a tame lion!”

A low moaning and whimpering was heard among the Beasts; and, after that, a dead silence which was more miserable still.

“And now there's another thing you got to learn,” said the Ape. “I hear some of you are saying I'm an Ape. Well, I'm not. I'm a Man. If I look like an Ape, that's because I'm so very old: hundreds and hundreds of years old. And it's because I'm so old that I'm so wise. And it's because I'm so wise that I'm the only one Aslan is ever going to speak to. He can't be bothered talking to a lot of stupid animals. He'll tell me what you've got to do, and I'll tell the rest of you. And take my advice, and see you do it in double quick time, for he doesn't mean to stand any nonsense.”

There was a dead silence except for the noise of a very young badger crying and its mother trying to make it keep quiet.

“And now here's another thing,” the Ape went on, fitting a fresh nut into its cheek, “I hear some of the horses are saying, Let's hurry up and get this job of carting timber over as quickly as we can, and then we'll be free again. Well, you can get that idea out of your heads at once. And not only the Horses either. Everybody who can work is going to be made to work in future. Aslan has it all settled with the King of Calormen—The Tisroc, as our dark faced friends the Calormenes call him. All you Horses and Bulls and Donkeys are to be sent down into Calormen to work for your living—pulling and carrying the way horses and such-like do in other countries. And all you digging animals like Moles and Rabbits and Dwarfs are going down to work in The Tisroc's mines. And—”

“No, no, no,” howled the Beasts. “It can't be true. Aslan would never sell us into slavery to the King of Calormen.”

“None of that! Hold your noise!” said the Ape with a snarl. “Who said anything about slavery? You won't be slaves. You'll be paid—very good wages too. That is to say, your pay will be paid into Aslan's treasury and he will use it all for everybody's good.” Then he glanced, and almost winked, at the chief Calormene.

The Calormene bowed and replied, in the pompous Calormene way:

“Most sapient Mouthpiece of Aslan, The Tisroc (may-he-live-forever) is wholly of one mind with your lordship in this judicious plan.”

“There! You see!” said the Ape. “It's all arranged. And all for your own good. We'll be able, with the money you earn, to make Narnia a country worth living in. There'll be oranges and bananas pouring in—and roads and big cities and schools and offices and whips and muzzles and saddles and cages and kennels and prisons—Oh, everything.”

“But we don't want all those things,” said an old Bear. “We want to be free. And we want to hear Aslan speak himself.”

“Now don't you start arguing,” said the Ape, “for it's a thing I won't stand. I'm a Man: you're only a fat, stupid old Bear. What do you know about freedom? You think freedom means doing what you like. Well, you're wrong. That isn't true freedom. True freedom means doing what I tell you.”

“H-n-n-h,” grunted the Bear and scratched its head; it found this sort of thing hard to understand.

“Please, please,” said the high voice of a woolly lamb, who was so young that everyone was surprised he dared to speak at all.

“Please,” said the Lamb, “I can't understand. What have we to do with the Calormenes? We belong to Aslan. They belong to Tash. They have a god called Tash. They say he has four arms and the head of a vulture. They kill Men on his altar. I don't believe there's any such person as Tash. But if there was, how could Aslan be friends with him?”

All the animals cocked their heads sideways and all their bright eyes flashed towards the Ape. They knew it was the best question anyone had asked yet.

The Ape jumped up and spat at the Lamb.

“Baby!” he hissed. “Silly little bleater! Go home to your mother and drink milk. What do you understand of such things? But the others, listen. Tash is only another name for Aslan. All that old idea of us being right and the Calormenes wrong is silly. We know better now. The Calormenes use different words but we all mean the same thing. Tash and Aslan are only two different names for you know Who. That's why there can never be any quarrel between them. Get that into your heads, you stupid brutes. Tash is Aslan: Aslan is Tash.”

You know how sad your own dog's face can look sometimes. Think of that and then think of all the faces of those Talking Beasts—all those honest, humble, bewildered Birds, Bears, Badgers, Rabbits, Moles, and Mice—all far sadder than that. Every tail was down, every whisker drooped. It would have broken your heart with very pity to see their faces. There was only one who did not look at all unhappy.

It was a ginger Cat—a great big Tom in the prime of life—who sat bolt upright with his tail curled round his toes, in the very front row of all the Beasts. He had been staring hard at the Ape and the Calormene captain all the time and had never once blinked his eyes.

“Excuse me,” said the Cat very politely, “but this interests me. Does your friend from Calormen say the same?”

“Assuredly,” said the Calormene. “The enlightened Ape—Man, I mean—is in the right. Aslan means neither less nor more than Tash.”

“Especially, Aslan means no more than Tash?” suggested the Cat.

“No more at all,” said the Calormene, looking the Cat straight in the face.

“Is that good enough for you, Ginger?” said the Ape.

“Oh certainly,” said Ginger coolly. “Thank you very much. I only wanted to be quite clear. I think I am beginning to understand.”

Up till now the King and Jewel had said nothing: they were waiting until the Ape should bid them speak, for they thought it was no use interrupting. But now, as Tirian looked round on the miserable faces of the Narnians, and saw how they would all believe that Aslan and Tash were one and the same, he could bear it no longer.

“Ape,” he cried with a great voice, “you lie damnably. You lie like a Calormene. You lie like an Ape.”

He meant to go on and ask how the terrible god Tash who fed on the blood of his people could possibly be the same as the good Lion by whose blood all Narnia was saved. If he had been allowed to speak, the rule of the Ape might have ended that day; the Beasts might have seen the truth and thrown the Ape down. But before he could say another word two Calormenes struck him in the mouth with all their force, and a third, from behind, kicked his feet from under him. And as he fell, the Ape squealed in rage and terror.

“Take him away. Take him away. Take him where he cannot hear us, nor we hear him. There tie him to a tree. I will—I mean, Aslan will—do justice on him later.”





Chapter 4　WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT


The King was so dizzy from being knocked down that he hardly knew what was happening until the Calormenes untied his wrists and put his arms straight down by his sides and set him with his back against an ash tree. Then they bound ropes round his ankles and his knees and his waist and his chest and left him there. What worried him worst at the moment—for it is often little things that are hardest to stand—was that his lip was bleeding where they had hit him and he couldn't wipe the little trickle of blood away although it tickled him.

From where he was he could still see the little stable on the top of the hill and the Ape sitting in front of it. He could just hear the Ape's voice still going on and, every now and then, some answer from the crowd, but he could not make out the words.

“I wonder what they've done to Jewel,” thought the King.

Presently the crowd of beasts broke up and began going away in different directions. Some passed close to Tirian. They looked at him as if they were both frightened and sorry to see him tied up but none of them spoke. Soon they had all gone and there was silence in the wood. Then hours and hours went past and Tirian became first very thirsty and then very hungry; and as the afternoon dragged on and turned into evening, he became cold too. His back was very sore. The sun went down and it began to be twilight.

When it was almost dark Tirian heard a light pitter-patter of feet and saw some small creatures coming towards him. The three on the left were Mice, and there was a Rabbit in the middle: on the right were two Moles. Both these were carrying little bags on their backs which gave them a curious look in the dark so that at first he wondered what kind of beasts they were. Then, in a moment, they were all standing up on their hind legs, laying their cool paws on his knees and giving his knees snuffly animal kisses. (They could reach his knees because Narnian Talking Beasts of that sort are bigger than the dumb beasts of the same kind in England.)

“Lord King! dear Lord King,” said their shrill voices, “we are so sorry for you. We daren't untie you because Aslan might be angry with us. But we've brought you your supper.”

At once the first Mouse climbed nimbly up till he was perched on the rope that bound Tirian's chest and was wrinkling his blunt nose in front of Tirian's face. Then the second Mouse climbed up and hung on just below the first Mouse. The other beasts stood on the ground and began handing things up.

“Drink, Sire, and then you'll find you are able to eat,” said the topmost Mouse, and Tirian found that a little wooden cup was being held to his lips. It was only the size of an egg cup so that he had hardly tasted the wine in it before it was empty. But then the Mouse passed it down and the others re-filled it and it was passed up again and Tirian emptied it a second time. In this way they went on till he had quite a good drink, which was all the better for coming in little doses, for that is more thirst-quenching than one long draught.

“Here is cheese, Sire,” said the first Mouse, “but not very much, for fear it would make you too thirsty.” And after the cheese they fed him with oat-cakes and fresh butter, and then with some more wine.

“Now hand up the water,” said the first Mouse, “and I'll wash the King's face. There is blood on it.”

Then Tirian felt something like a tiny sponge dabbing his face, and it was most refreshing.

“Little friends,” said Tirian, “how can I thank you for all this?”

“You needn't, you needn't,” said the little voices. “What else could we do? We don't want any other King. We're your people. If it was only the Ape and the Calormenes who were against you we would have fought till we were cut into pieces before we'd let them tie you up. We would, we would indeed. But we can't go against Aslan.”

“Do you think it really is Aslan?” asked the King.

“Oh yes, yes,” said the Rabbit. “He came out of the stable last night. We all saw him.”

“What was he like?” said the King.

“Like a terrible, great Lion, to be sure,” said one of the Mice.

“And you think it is really Aslan who is killing the Wood-Nymphs and making you all slaves to the King of Calormen?”

“Ah, that's bad, isn't it?” said the second Mouse. “It would have been better if we'd died before all this began. But there's no doubt about it. Everyone says it is Aslan's orders. And we've seen him. We didn't think Aslan would be like that. Why, we—we wanted him to come back to Narnia.”

“He seems to have come back very angry this time,” said the first Mouse. “We must all have done something dreadfully wrong without knowing it. He must be punishing us for something. But I do think we might be told what it was!”

“I suppose what we're doing now may be wrong,” said the Rabbit.

“I don't care if it is,” said one of the Moles. “I'd do it again.”

But the others said, “Oh hush,” and “Do be careful,” and then they all said, “We're sorry, dear King, but we must go back now. It would never do for us to be caught here.”

“Leave me at once, dear Beasts,” said Tirian. “I would not for all Narnia bring any of you into danger.”

“Goodnight, goodnight,” said the Beasts, rubbing their noses against his knees. “We will come back—if we can.” Then they all pattered away and the wood seemed darker and colder and lonelier than it had been before they came.

The stars came out and time went slowly on—imagine how slowly—while that last King of Narnia stood stiff and sore and upright against the tree in his bonds. But at last something happened.

Far away there appeared a red light. Then it disappeared for a moment and came back again, bigger and stronger. Then he could see dark shapes going to and fro on this side of the light and carrying bundles and throwing them down. He knew now what he was looking at. It was a bonfire, newly lit, and people were throwing bundles of brushwood on to it. Presently it blazed up and Tirian could see that it was on the very top of the hill. He could see quite clearly the stable behind it, all lit up in the red glow, and a great crowd of Beasts and Men between the fire and himself. A small figure, hunched up beside the fire, must be the Ape. It was saying something to the crowd, but he could not hear what. Then it went and bowed three times to the ground in front of the door of the stable. Then it got up and opened the door. And something on four legs—something that walked rather stiffly—came out of the stable and stood facing the crowd.

A great wailing or howling went up, so loud that Tirian could hear some of the words.

“Aslan! Aslan! Aslan!” cried the Beasts. “Speak to us. Comfort us. Be angry with us no more.”

From where Tirian was he could not make out very clearly what the thing was; but he could see that it was yellow and hairy. He had never seen the Great Lion. He had never seen a common lion. He couldn't be sure that what he saw was not the real Aslan. He had not expected Aslan to look like that stiff thing which stood and said nothing. But how could one be sure? For a moment horrible thoughts went through his mind: then he remembered the nonsense about Tash and Aslan being the same and knew that the whole thing must be a cheat.

The Ape put his head close up to the yellow thing's head as if he were listening to something it was whispering to him. Then he turned and spoke to the crowd, and the crowd wailed again. Then the yellow thing turned clumsily round and walked—you might almost say, waddled—back into the stable and the Ape shut the door behind it. After that the fire must have been put out for the light vanished quite suddenly, and Tirian was once more alone with the cold and the darkness.

He thought of other Kings who had lived and died in Narnia in old times and it seemed to him that none of them had ever been so unlucky as himself. He thought of his great-grandfather's great-grandfather King Rilian who had been stolen away by a Witch when he was only a young prince and kept hidden for years in the dark caves beneath the land of the Northern Giants. But then it had all come; right in the end, for two mysterious children had suddenly appeared from the land beyond the world's end and had rescued him so that he came home to Narnia and had a long and prosperous reign. “It's not like that with me,” said Tirian to himself.

Then he went further back and: thought about Rilian's father, Caspian the Seafarer, whose wicked uncle King Miraz had tried to murder him and how Caspian had fled away into the woods and lived among the Dwarfs. But that story too had all come right in the end: for Caspian also had been helped by children—only there were four of them that time—who came from somewhere beyond the world and fought a great battle and set him on his father's throne. “But it was all long ago,” said Tirian to himself. “That sort of thing doesn't happen now.”

And then he remembered (for he had always been good at history when he was a boy) how those same four children who had helped Caspian had been in Narnia over a thousand years before; and it was then that they had done the most remarkable thing of all. For then they had defeated the terrible White Witch and ended the Hundred Years of Winter, and after that they had reigned (all four of them together) at Cair Paravel, till they were no longer children but great Kings and lovely Queens, and their reign had been the golden age of Narnia. And Aslan had come into that story a lot. He had come into all the other stories too, as Tirian now remembered. “Aslan—and children from another world,” thought Tirian. “They have always come in when things were at their worst. Oh, if only they could now.”

And he called out “Aslan! Aslan! Aslan! Come and help us now.”

But the darkness and the cold and the quietness went on just the same.

“Let me be killed,” cried the King. “I ask nothing for myself. But come and save all Narnia.”

And still there was no change in the night or the wood, but there began to be a kind of change inside Tirian. Without knowing why, he began to feel a faint hope. And he felt somehow stronger. “Oh Aslan, Aslan,” he whispered. “If you will not come yourself, at least send me the helpers from beyond the world. Or let me call them. Let my voice carry beyond the world.” Then, hardly knowing that he was doing it, he suddenly cried out in a great voice:

“Children! Children! Friends of Narnia! Quick. Come to me. Across the worlds I call you; I Tirian, King of Narnia, Lord of Cair Paravel, and Emperor of the Lone Islands!”

And immediately he was plunged into a dream (if it was a dream) more vivid than any he had had in his life.

He seemed to be standing in a lighted room where seven people sat round a table. It looked as if they had just finished their meal. Two of those people were very old, an old man with a white beard and an old woman with wise, merry, twinkling eyes. He who sat at the right hand of the old man was hardly full grown, certainly younger than Tirian himself, but his face had already the look of a king and a warrior. And you could almost say the same of the other youth who sat at the right hand of the old woman. Facing Tirian across the table sat a fair-haired girl younger than either of these, and on either side of her a boy and girl who were younger still. They were all dressed in what seemed to Tirian the oddest kind of clothes.

But he had no time to think about details like that, for instantly the younger boy and both the girls started to their feet, and one of them gave a little scream. The old woman started and drew in her breath sharply. The old man must have made some sudden movement too for the wine glass which stood at his right hand was swept off the table: Tirian could hear the tinkling noise as it broke on the floor.

Then Tirian realized that these people could see him; they were staring at him as if they saw a ghost. But he noticed that the king-like one who sat at the old man's right never moved (though he turned pale) except that he clenched his hand very tight. Then he said:

“Speak, if you're not a phantom or a dream. You have a Narnian look about you and we are the seven friends of Narnia.”

Tirian was longing to speak, and he tried to cry out aloud that he was Tirian of Narnia, in great need of help. But he found (as I have sometimes found in dreams too) that his voice made no noise at all.

The one who had already spoken to him rose to his feet. “Shadow or spirit or whatever you are,” he said, fixing his eyes full upon Tirian. “If you are from Narnia, I charge you in the name of Aslan, speak to me. I am Peter the High King.”

The room began to swim before Tirian's eyes. He heard the voices of those seven people all speaking at once, and all getting fainter every second, and they were saying things like, “Look! It's fading.” “It's melting away.” “It's vanishing.”

Next moment he was wide awake, still tied to the tree, colder and stiffer than ever. The wood was full of the pale, dreary light that comes before sunrise, and he was soaking wet with dew; it was nearly morning.

That waking was about the worst moment he had ever had in his life.





Chapter 5　HOW HELP CAME TO THE KING


But his misery did not last long. Almost at once there came a bump, and then a second bump, and two children were standing before him. The wood in front of him had been quite empty a second before and he knew they had not come from behind his tree, for he would have heard them. They had in fact simply appeared from nowhere.

He saw at a glance that they were wearing the same queer, dingy sort of clothes as the people in his dream; and he saw, at a second glance, that they were the youngest boy and girl out of that party of seven.

“Gosh!” said the boy, “that took one's breath away! I thought—”

“Hurry up and get him untied,” said the girl. “We can talk, afterwards.” Then she added, turning to Tirian, “I'm sorry we've been so long. We came the moment we could.”

While she was speaking the Boy produced a knife from his pocket and was quickly cutting the King's bonds: too quickly, in fact, for the King was so stiff and numb that when the last cord was cut he fell forward on his hands and knees. He couldn't get up again till he had brought some life back into his legs by a good rubbing.

“I say,” said the girl. “It was you, wasn't it, who appeared to us that night when we were all at supper? Nearly a week ago.”

“A week, fair maid?” said Tirian. “My dream led me into your world scarce ten minutes since.”

“It's the usual muddle about times, Pole,” said the Boy.

“I remember now,” said Tirian. “That too comes in all the old tales. The time of your strange land is different from ours. But if we speak of Time, 'tis time to be gone from here: for my enemies are close at hand. Will you come with me?”

“Of course,” said the girl. “It's you we've come to help.”

Tirian got to his feet and led them rapidly down hill, Southward and away from the stable. He knew where he meant to go but his first aim was to get to rocky places where they would leave no trail, and his second to cross some water so that they would leave no scent.

This took them about an hour's scrambling and wading and while that was going on nobody had any breath to talk. But even so, Tirian kept on stealing glances at his companions. The wonder of walking beside the creatures from another world made him feel a little dizzy: but it also made all the old stories seem far more real than they had ever seemed before…anything might happen now.

“Now,” said Tirian as they came to the head of a little valley which ran down before them among young birch trees, “we are out of danger of those villains for a space and may walk more easily.” The sun had risen, dew-drops were twinkling on every branch, and birds were singing.

“What about some grub?—I mean for you, Sir, we two have had our breakfast,” said the Boy.

Tirian wondered very much what he meant by “grub”, but when the Boy opened a bulgy satchel which he was carrying and pulled out a rather greasy and squashy packet, he understood. He was ravenously hungry, though he hadn't thought about it till that moment.

There were two hard-boiled egg sandwiches, and two cheese sandwiches, and two with some kind of paste in them. If he hadn't been so hungry he wouldn't have thought much of the paste, for that is a sort of food nobody eats in Narnia. By the time he had eaten all six sandwiches they had come to the bottom of the valley and there they found a mossy cliff with a little fountain bubbling out of it. All three stopped and drank and splashed their hot faces.

“And now,” said the girl as she tossed her wet hair back from her forehead, “aren't you going to tell us who you are and why you were tied up and what it's all about?”

“With a good will, damsel,” said Tirian. “But we must keep on the march.” So while they went on walking he told them who he was and all the things that had happened to him. “And now,” he said at the end, “I am going to a certain tower, one of three that were built in my grandsire's time to guard Lantern Waste against certain perilous outlaws who dwelled there in his day. By Aslan's good will I was not robbed of my keys. In that tower we shall find stores of weapons and mail and some victuals also, though no better than dry biscuit. There also we can lie safe while we make our plans. And now, prithee, tell me who you two are and all your story.”

“I'm Eustace Scrubb and this is Jill Pole,” said the Boy. “And we were here once before, ages and ages ago, more than a year ago by our time, and there was a chap called Prince Rilian, and they were keeping this chap underground, and Puddleglum put his foot in—”

“Ha!” cried Tirian, “are you then that Eustace and that Jill who rescued King Rilian from his long enchantment?”

“Yes, that's us,” said Jill. “So he's King Rilian now, is he? Oh of course he would be. I forgot—”

“Nay,” said Tirian, “I am the seventh in descent from him. He has been dead over two hundred years.”

Jill made a face. “Ugh!” she said. “That's the horrid part about coming back to Narnia.”

But Eustace went on. “Well now you know who we are, Sire,” he said. “And it was like this. The Professor and Aunt Polly had got all us friends of Narnia together—”

“I know not these names, Eustace,” said Tirian.

“They're the two who came into Narnia at the very beginning, the day all the animals learned to talk.”

“By the Lion's Mane,” cried Tirian. “Those two! The Lord Digory and the Lady Polly! From the dawn of the world! And still in your place? The wonder and the glory of it! But tell me, tell me.”

“She isn't really our aunt, you know,” said Eustace. “She's Miss Plummer, but we call her Aunt Polly. Well those two got us all together partly just for fun, so that we could all have a good jaw about Narnia (for of course there's no one else we can ever talk to about things like that) but partly because the Professor had a feeling that we were somehow wanted over here.

“Well then you came in like a ghost or goodness-knows-what and nearly frightened the lives out of us and vanished without saying a word. After that, we knew for certain there was something up. The next question was how to get here. You can't go just by wanting to. So we talked and talked and at last the Professor said the only way would be by the Magic Rings. It was by those Rings that he and Aunt Polly got here long, long ago when they were only kids, years before we younger ones were born.

“But the Rings had all been buried in the garden of a house in London (that's our big town, Sire) and the house had been sold. So then the problem was how to get at them. You'll never guess what we did in the end! Peter and Edmund—that's the High King Peter, the one who spoke to you—went up to London to get into the garden from the back, early in the morning before people were up. They were dressed like workmen so that if anyone did see them it would look as if they'd come to do something about the drains. I wish I'd been with them: it must have been glorious fun. And they must have succeeded for next day Peter sent us a wire—that's a sort of message, Sire, I'll explain about it some other time—to say he'd got the Rings. And the day after that was the day Pole and I had to go back to school—we're the only two who are still at school and we're at the same one. So Peter and Edmund were to meet us at a place on the way down to school and hand over the Rings. It had to be us two who were to go to Narnia, you see, because the older ones couldn't come again.

“So we got into the train that's a kind of thing people travel in in our world: a lot of wagons chained together—and the Professor and Aunt Polly and Lucy came with us. We wanted to keep together as long as we could. Well there we were in the train. And we were just getting to the station where the others were to meet us, and I was looking out of the window to see if I could see them when suddenly there came a most frightful jerk and a noise: and there we were in Narnia and there was your Majesty tied up to the tree.”

“So you never used the Rings?” said Tirian.

“No,” said Eustace. “Never even saw them. Aslan did it all for us in his own way without any Rings.”

“But the High King Peter has them,” said Tirian.

“Yes,” said Jill. “But we don't think he can use them. When the two other Pevensies—King Edmund and Queen Lucy—were last here, Aslan said they would never come to Narnia again. And he said something of the same sort to the High King, only longer ago. You may be sure he'll come like a shot if he's allowed.”

“Gosh!” said Eustace. “It's getting hot in this sun. Are we nearly there, Sire?”

“Look,” said Tirian and pointed. Not many yards away grey battlements rose above the tree-tops, and after a minute's more walking they came out in an open grassy space. A stream ran across it and on the far side of the stream stood a squat, square tower with very few and narrow windows and one heavy-looking door in the wall that faced them.

Tirian looked sharply this way and that to make sure that no enemies were in sight. Then he walked up to the tower and stood still for a moment fishing up his bunch of keys which he wore inside his hunting-dress on a narrow silver chain that went round his neck. It was a nice bunch of keys that he brought out, for two were golden and many were richly ornamented: you could see at once that they were keys made for opening solemn and secret rooms in palaces, or chests and caskets of sweet-smelling wood that contained royal treasures. But the key which he now put into the lock of the door was big and plain and more rudely made. The lock was stiff and for a moment Tirian began to be afraid that he would not be able to turn it: but at last he did and the door swung open with a sullen creak.

“Welcome friends,” said Tirian. “I fear this is the best palace that the King of Narnia can now offer to his guests.”

Tirian was pleased to see that the two strangers had been well brought up. They both said not to mention it and that they were sure it would be very nice.

As a matter of fact it was not particularly nice. It was rather dark and smelled very damp. There was only one room in it and this room went right up to the stone roof: a wooden staircase in one corner led up to a trap door by which you could get out on the battlements. There were a few rude bunks to sleep in, and a great many lockers and bundles. There was also a hearth which looked as if nobody had lit a fire in it for a great many years.

“We'd better go out and gather some firewood first thing, hadn't we?” said Jill.

“Not yet, comrade,” said Tirian. He was determined that they should not be caught unarmed, and began searching the lockers, thankfully remembering that he had always been careful to have these garrison towers inspected once a year and to make sure that they were stocked with all things needful. The bow strings were there in their coverings of oiled silk, the swords and spears were greased against rust, and the armour was kept bright in its wrappings. But there was something even better. “Look you!” said Tirian as he drew out a long mail shirt of a curious pattern and flashed it before the children's eyes.

“That's funny-looking mail, Sire,” said Eustace.

“Aye, lad,” said Tirian. “No Narnian Dwarf smithied that. 'tis mail of Calormen, outlandish gear. I have ever kept a few suits of it in readiness, for I never knew when I or my friends might have reason to walk unseen in The Tisroc's land. And look on this stone bottle. In this there is a juice which, when we have rubbed it on our hands and faces, will make us brown as Calormenes.”

“Oh hurrah!” said Jill. “Disguise! I love disguises.”

Tirian showed them how to pour out a little of the juice into the palms of their hands and then rub it well over their faces and necks, right down to the shoulders, and then on their hands, right up to the elbows. He did the same himself.

“After this has hardened on us,” he said, “we may wash in water and it will not change. Nothing but oil and ashes will make us white Narnians again. And now, sweet Jill, let us go see how this mail shirt becomes you. 'tis something too long, yet not so much as I feared. Doubtless it belonged to a page in the train of one of their Tarkaans.”

After the mail shirts they put on Calormene helmets, which are little round ones fitting tight to the head and having a spike on top. Then Tirian took long rolls of some white stuff out of the locker and wound them over the helmets till they became turbans: but the little steel spike still stuck up in the middle. He and Eustace took curved Calormene swords and little round shields. There was no sword light enough for Jill, but he gave her a long, straight hunting knife which might do for a sword at a pinch.

“Hast any skill with the bow, maiden?” said Tirian.

“Nothing worth talking of,” said Jill, blushing. “Scrubb's not bad.”

“Don't you believe her, Sire,” said Eustace. “We've both been practising archery ever since we got back from Narnia last time, and she's about as good as me now. Not that either of us is much.”

Then Tirian gave Jill a bow and a quiver full of arrows. The next business was to light a fire, for inside that tower it still felt more like a cave than like anything indoors and set one shivering. But they got warm gathering wood—the sun was now at its highest—and once the blaze was roaring up the chimney the place began to look cheerful.

Dinner was, however, a dull meal, for the best they could do was to pound up some of the hard biscuit which they found in a locker and pour it into boiling water, with salt, so as to make a kind of porridge. And of course there was nothing to drink but water.

“I wish we'd brought a packet of tea,” said Jill.

“Or a tin of cocoa,” said Eustace.

“A firkin or so of good wine in each of these towers would not have been amiss,” said Tirian.





Chapter 6　A GOOD NIGHT's WORK


About four hours later Tirian flung himself into one of the bunks to snatch a little sleep. The two children were already snoring: he had made them go to bed before he did because they would have to be up most of the night and he knew that at their age they couldn't do without sleep. Also, he had tired them out. First he had given Jill some practice in archery and found that, though not up to Narnian standards, she was really not too bad. Indeed she had succeeded in shooting a rabbit (not a Talking rabbit, of course: there are lots of the ordinary kind about in Western Narnia) and it was already skinned, cleaned, and hanging up. He had found that both the children knew all about this chilly and smelly job; they had learned that kind of thing on their great journey through Giant-Land in the days of Prince Rilian.

Then he had tried to teach Eustace how to use his sword and shield. Eustace had learned quite a lot about sword fighting on his earlier adventures but that had been all with a straight Narnian sword. He had never handled a curved Calormene scimitar and that made it hard, for many of the strokes are quite different and some of the habits he had learned with the long sword had now to be unlearned again. But Tirian found that he had a good eye and was very quick on his feet. He was surprised at the strength of both children: in fact they both seemed to be already much stronger and bigger and more grown-up than they had been when he first met them a few hours ago. It is one of the effects which Narnian air often has on visitors from our world.

All three of them agreed that the very first thing they must do was to go back to Stable Hill and try to rescue Jewel the Unicorn. After that, if they succeeded, they would try to get away Eastward and meet the little army which Roonwit the Centaur would be bringing from Cair Paravel.

An experienced warrior and huntsman like Tirian can always wake up at the time he wants. So he gave himself till nine o'clock that night and then put all worries out of his head and fell asleep at once. It seemed only a moment later when he woke but he knew by the light and the very feel of things that he had timed his sleep exactly. He got up, put on his helmet-and-turban (he had slept in his mail shirt), and then shook the other two till they woke up. They looked, to tell the truth, very grey and dismal as they climbed out of their bunks and there was a good deal of yawning.

“Now,” said Tirian, “we go due North from here—by good fortune 'tis a starry night—and it will be much shorter than our journey this morning, for then we went round-about but now we shall go straight. If we are challenged, then do you two hold your peace and I will do my best to talk like a curst, cruel, proud lord of Calormen. If I draw my sword then thou, Eustace, must do likewise and let Jill leap behind us and stand with an arrow on the string. But if I cry ‘Home’, then fly for the Tower both of you. And let none try to fight on—not even one stroke after I have given the retreat: such false valour has spoiled many notable plans in the wars. And now, friends, in the name of Aslan let us go forward.”

Out they went into the cold night. All the great Northern stars were burning above the tree-tops. The North-Star of that world is called the Spear-Head: it is brighter than our Pole Star.

For a time they could go straight towards the Spear-Head but presently they came to a dense thicket so that they had to go out of their course to get round it. And after that—for they were still overshadowed by branches—it was hard to pick up their bearings. It was Jill who set them right again: she had been an excellent Guide in England. And of course she knew her Narnian stars perfectly, having travelled so much in the wild Northern Lands, and could work out the direction from other stars even when the Spear-Head was hidden.

As soon as Tirian saw that she was the best pathfinder of the three of them he put her in front. And then he was astonished to find how silently and almost invisibly she glided on before them.

“By the Mane!” he whispered to Eustace. “This girl is a wondrous wood-maid. If she had Dryad's blood in her she could scarce do it better.”

“She's so small, that's what helps,” whispered Eustace. But Jill from in front said: “S-s-s-h, less noise.”

All round them the wood was very quiet. Indeed it was far too quiet. On an ordinary Narnia night there ought to have been noises—an occasional cheery “Goodnight” from a Hedgehog, the cry of an Owl overhead, perhaps a flute in the distance to tell of Fauns dancing, or some throbbing, hammering noises from Dwarfs underground. All that was silenced: gloom and fear reigned over Narnia.

After a time they began to go steeply uphill and the trees grew further apart. Tirian could dimly make out the wellknown hill-top and the stable. Jill was now going with more and more caution: she kept on making signs to the others with her hand to do the same. Then she stopped dead still and Tirian saw her gradually sink down into the grass and disappear without a sound. A moment later she rose again, put her mouth close to Tirian's ear, and said in the lowest possible whisper, “Get down. Thee better.” She said thee for see not because she had a lisp but because she knew the hissing letter S is the part of a whisper most likely to be overheard.

Tirian at once lay down, almost as silently as Jill, but not quite, for he was heavier and older. And once they were down, he saw how from that position you could see the edge of the hill sharp against the star-strewn sky. Two black shapes rose against it: one was the stable, and the other, a few feet in front of it, was a Calormene sentry. He was keeping very ill watch: not walking or even standing but sitting with his spear over his shoulder and his chin on his chest.

“Well done,” said Tirian to Jill. She had shown him exactly what he needed to know.

They got up and Tirian now took the lead. Very slowly, hardly daring to breathe, they made their way up to a little clump of trees which was not more than forty feet away from the sentinel.

“Wait here till I come again,” he whispered to the other two. “If I miscarry, fly.” Then he sauntered out boldly in full view of the enemy. The man started when he saw him and was just going to jump to his feet: he was afraid Tirian might be one of his own officers and that he would get into trouble for sitting down. But before he could get up Tirian had dropped on one knee beside him, saying:

“Art thou a warrior of the Tisroc's, may he live for ever? It cheers my heart to meet thee among all these beasts and devils of Narnians. Give me thy hand, friend.”

Before he well knew what was happening the Calormene sentry found his right hand seized in a mighty grip. Next instant someone was kneeling on his legs and a dagger was pressed against his neck.

“One noise and thou art dead,” said Tirian in his ear. “Tell me where the Unicorn is and thou shalt live.”

“B—behind the stable, O My Master,” stammered the unfortunate man.

“Good. Rise up and lead me to him.”

As the man got up the point of the dagger never left his neck. It only travelled round (cold and rather ticklish) as Tirian got behind him and settled it at a convenient place under his ear. Trembling he went round to the back of the stable.

Though it was dark Tirian could see the white shape of Jewel at once.

“Hush!” he said. “No, do not neigh. Yes, Jewel, it is I. How have they tied thee?”

“Hobbled by all four legs and tied with a bridle to a ring in the stable wall,” came Jewel's voice.

“Stand here, sentry, with your back to the wall. So. Now, Jewel, set the point of your horn against this Calormene's breast.”

“With a good will, Sire,” said Jewel.

“If he moves, rive him to the heart.” Then in a few seconds Tirian cut the ropes. With the remains of them he bound the sentry hand and foot. Finally he made him open his mouth, stuffed it full of grass and tied him up from scalp to chin so that he could make no noise, lowered the man into a sitting position and set him against the wall.

“I have done thee some discourtesy, soldier,” said Tirian. “But such was my need. If we meet again I may happen to do thee a better turn. Now, Jewel, let us go softly.”

He put his left arm round the beast's neck and bent and kissed its nose and both had great joy. They went back as quietly as possible to the place where he had left the children. It was darker in there under the trees and he nearly ran into Eustace before he saw him.

“All's well,” whispered Tirian. “A good night's work. Now for home.”

They turned and had gone a few paces when Eustace said, “Where are you, Pole?” There was no answer. “Is Jill on the other side of you, Sire?” he asked.

“What?” said Tirian. “Is she not on the other side of your?”

It was a terrible moment. They dared not shout but they whispered her name in the loudest whisper they could manage. There was no reply.

“Did she go from you while I was away?” asked Tirian.

“I didn't see or hear her go,” said Eustace. “But she could have gone without my knowing. She can be as quiet as a cat; you've seen for yourself.”

At that moment a far off drum beat was heard. Jewel moved his ears forward. “Dwarfs,” he said.

“And treacherous Dwarfs, enemies, as likely as not,” muttered Tirian.

“And here comes something on hoofs, much nearer,” said Jewel.

The two humans and the Unicorn stood dead still. There were now so many different things to worry about that they didn't know what to do. The noise of hoofs came steadily nearer. And then, quite close to them, a voice whispered:

“Hallo! Are you all there?”

Thank heaven, it was Jill's.

“Where the devil have you been to?” said Eustace in a furious whisper, for he had been very frightened.

“In the stable,” gasped Jill, but it was the sort of gasp you give when you're struggling with suppressed laughter.

“Oh,” growled Eustace, “you think it funny, do you? Well all I can say is—”

“Have you got Jewel, Sire?” asked Jill.

“Yes. Here he is. What is that beast with you?”

“That's him,” said Jill. “But let's be off home before anyone wakes up.” And again there came little explosions of laughter.

The others obeyed at once for they had already lingered long enough in that dangerous place and the Dwarf drums seemed to have come a little nearer.

It was only after they had been walking Southward for several minutes that Eustace said:

“Got him? What do you mean?”

“The false Aslan,” said Jill.

“What?” said Tirian. “Where have you been? What have you done?”

“Well, Sire,” said Jill. “As soon as I saw that you'd got the sentry out of the way I thought hadn't I better have a look inside the stable and see what really is there? So I crawled along. It was as easy as anything to draw the bolt. Of course it was pitch black inside and smelled like any other stable. Then I struck a light and—would you believe it?—there was nothing at all there but this old donkey with a bundle of lion-skin tied on to his back. So I drew my knife and told him he'd have to come along with me. As a matter of fact I needn't have threatened him with the knife at all. He was very fed up with the stable and quite ready to come—weren't you, Puzzle dear?”

“Great Scott!” said Eustace. “Well I'm—jiggered. I was jolly angry with you a moment ago, and I still think it was mean of you to sneak off without the rest of us: but I must admit—well, I mean to say—well it was a perfectly gorgeous thing to do. If she was a boy she'd have to be knighted, wouldn't she, Sire?”

“If she was a boy,” said Tirian, “she'd be whipped for disobeying orders.” And in the dark no one could see whether he said this with a frown or a smile. Next minute there was a sound of rasping metal.

“What are you doing, Sire?” asked Jewel sharply.

“Drawing my sword to smite off the head of the accursed Ass,” said Tirian in a terrible voice. “Stand clear, girl.”

“Oh don't, please don't,” said Jill. “Really, you mustn't. It wasn't his fault. It was all the Ape. He didn't know any better. And he's very sorry. And he's a nice Donkey. His name's Puzzle. And I've got my arms round his neck.”

“Jill,” said Tirian, “you are the bravest and most woodwise of all my subjects, but also the most malapert and disobedient. Well: let the Ass live. What have you to say for yourself, Ass?”

“Me, Sire?” came the Donkey's voice. “I'm sure I'm very sorry if I've done wrong. The Ape said Aslan wanted me to dress up like that. And I thought he'd know. I'm not clever like him. I only did what I was told. It wasn't any fun for me living in that stable. I don't even know what's been going on outside. He never let me out except for a minute or two at night. Some days they forgot to give me any water too.”

“Sire,” said Jewel. “Those Dwarfs are coming nearer and nearer. Do we want to meet them?”

Tirian thought for a moment and then suddenly gave a great laugh out loud. Then he spoke, not this time in a whisper.

“By the Lion,” he said, “I am growing slow witted! Meet them? Certainly we will meet them. We will meet anyone now. We have this Ass to show them. Let them see the thing they have feared and bowed to. We can show them the truth of the Ape's vile plot. His secret's out. The tide's turned. Tomorrow we shall hang that Ape on the highest tree in Narnia. No more whispering and skulking and disguises. Where are these honest Dwarfs? We have good news for them.”

When you have been whispering for hours the mere sound of anyone talking out loud has a wonderfully stirring effect. The whole party began talking and laughing: even Puzzle lifted up his head and gave a grand Haw-hee-haw-hee-hee; a thing the Ape hadn't allowed him to do for days.

Then they set off in the direction of the drumming. It grew steadily louder and soon they could see torchlight as well. They came out on one of those rough roads (we should hardly call them roads at all in England) which ran through Lantern Waste. And there, marching sturdily along, were about thirty Dwarfs, all with their little spades and mattocks over their shoulders. Two armed Calormenes led the column and two more brought up the rear.

“Stay!” thundered Tirian as he stepped out on the road. “Stay, soldiers. Whither do you lead these Narnian Dwarfs and by whose orders?”





Chapter 7　MAINLY ABOUT DWARFS


The two Calormene soldiers at the head of the column, seeing what they took for a Tarkaan or great lord with two armed pages, came to a halt and raised their spears in salute.

“O My Master,” said one of them, “we lead these manikins to Calormen to work in the mines of The Tisroc, may-he-live-forever.”

“By the great god Tash, they are very obedient,” said Tirian. Then suddenly he turned to the Dwarfs themselves. About one in six of them carried a torch and by that flickering light he could see their bearded faces all looking at him with grim and dogged expressions.

“Has The Tisroc fought a great battle, Dwarfs, and conquered your land?” he asked, “that thus you go patiently to die in the salt-pits of Pugrahan?”

The two soldiers glared at him in surprise but the Dwarfs all answered, “Aslan's orders, Aslan's orders. He's sold us. What can we do against him?”

“Tisroc indeed!” added one and spat. “I'd like to see him try it!”

“Silence, dogs!” said the chief soldier.

“Look!” said Tirian, pulling Puzzle forward into the light. “It has all been a lie. Aslan has not come to Narnia at all. You have been cheated by the Ape. This is the thing he brought out of the stable to show you. Look at it.”

What the Dwarfs saw, now that they could see it close, was certainly enough to make them wonder how they had ever been taken in. The lion-skin had got pretty untidy already during Puzzle's imprisonment in the stable and it had been knocked crooked during his journey through the dark wood. Most of it was in a big lump on one shoulder. The head, besides being pushed sideways, had somehow got very far back so that anyone could now see his silly, gentle, donkeyish face gazing out of it. Some grass stuck out of one corner of his mouth, for he'd been doing a little quiet nibbling as they brought him along. And he was muttering, “It wasn't my fault, I'm not clever. I never said I was.”

For one second all the Dwarfs were staring at Puzzle with wide open mouths and then one of the soldiers said sharply, “Are you mad, My Master? What are you doing to the slaves?” and the other said, “And who are you?” Neither of their spears was at the salute now—both were down and ready for action.

“Give the password,” said the chief soldier.

“This is my password,” said the King as he drew his sword. “The light is dawning, the lie broken. Now guard thee, miscreant, for I am Tirian of Narnia.”

He flew upon the chief soldier like lightning. Eustace, who had drawn his sword when he saw the King draw his, rushed at the other one: his face was deadly pale, but I wouldn't blame him for that. And he had the luck that beginners sometimes do have. He forgot all that Tirian had tried to teach him that afternoon, slashed wildly (indeed I'm not sure his eyes weren't shut) and suddenly found, to his own great surprise, that the Calormene lay dead at his feet. And though that was a great relief, it was, at the moment, rather frightening. The King's fight lasted a second or two longer: then he too had killed his man and shouted to Eustace, “'Ware the other two.”

But the Dwarfs had settled the two remaining Calormenes. There was no enemy left.

“Well struck, Eustace!” cried Tirian, clapping him on the back. “Now, Dwarfs, you are free. Tomorrow I will lead you to free all Narnia. Three cheers for Aslan!”

But the result which followed was simply wretched. There was a feeble attempt from a few Dwarfs (about five) which died away all at once: from several others there were sulky growls. Many said nothing at all.

“Don't they understand?” said Jill impatiently. “What's wrong with all you Dwarfs? Don't you hear what the King says? It's all over. The Ape isn't going to rule Narnia any longer. Everyone can go back to ordinary life. You can have fun again. Aren't you glad?”

After a pause of nearly a minute a not-very-nice-looking Dwarf with hair and beard as black as soot said: “And who might you be, Missie?”

“I'm Jill,” she said. “The same Jill who rescued King Rilian from the enchantment and this is Eustace who did it too—and we've come back from another world after hundreds of years. Aslan sent us.”

The Dwarfs all looked at one another with grins; sneering grins, not merry ones.

“Well,” said the Black Dwarf (whose name was Griffle), “I don't know how all you chaps feel, but I feel I've heard as much about Aslan as I want to for the rest of my life.”

“That's right, that's right,” growled the other Dwarfs. “It's all a plant, all a blooming plant.”

“What do you mean?” said Tirian. He had not been pale when he was fighting but he was pale now. He had thought this was going to be a beautiful moment, but it was turning out more like a bad dream.

“You must think we're blooming soft in the head, that you must,” said Griffle. “We've been taken in once and now you expect us to be taken in again the next minute. We've no more use for stories about Aslan, see! Look at him! An old moke with long ears!”

“By heaven, you make me mad,” said Tirian. “Which of us said that was Aslan? That is the Ape's imitation of the real Aslan. Can't you understand?”

“And you've got a better imitation, I suppose!” said Griffle. “No thanks. We've been fooled once and we're not going to be fooled again.”

“I have not,” said Tirian angrily, “I serve the real Aslan.”

“Where's he? Who's he? Show him to us!” said several Dwarfs.“Do you think I keep him in my wallet, fools?” said Tirian. “Who am I that I could make Aslan appear at my bidding? He's not a tame lion.”

The moment those words were out of his mouth he realized that he had made a false move. The Dwarfs at once began repeating “not a tame lion, not a tame lion,” in a jeering sing-song. “That's what the other lot kept on telling us,” said one.

“Do you mean you don't believe in the real Aslan?” said Jill. “But I've seen him. And he has sent us two here out of a different world.”

“Ah,” said Griffle with a broad smile. “So you say. They've taught you your stuff all right. Saying your lessons, ain't you?”

“Churl,” cried Tirian, “will you give a lady the lie to her very face?”

“You keep a civil tongue in your head, Mister,” replied the Dwarf. “I don't think we want any more Kings—if you are Tirian, which you don't look like him—no more than we want any Aslans. We're going to look after ourselves from now on and touch our caps to nobody. See?”

“That's right,” said the other Dwarfs. “We're on our own now. No more Aslan, no more Kings, no more silly stories about other worlds. The Dwarfs are for the Dwarfs.” And they began to fall into their places and to get ready for marching back to wherever they had come from.

“Little beasts!” said Eustace. “Aren't you even going to say thank you for being saved from the salt-mines?”

“Oh, we know all about that,” said Griffle over his shoulder. “You wanted to make use of us, that's why you rescued us. You're playing some game of your own. Come on you chaps.”

And the Dwarfs struck up the queer little marching song which goes with the drum-beat, and off they tramped into the darkness.

Tirian and his friends stared after them. Then he said the single word “Come,” and they continued their journey.

They were a silent party. Puzzle felt himself to be still in disgrace, and also he didn't really quite understand what had happened. Jill, besides being disgusted with the Dwarfs, was very impressed with Eustace's victory over the Calormene and felt almost shy. As for Eustace, his heart was still beating rather quickly.

Tirian and Jewel walked sadly together in the rear. The King had his arm on the Unicorn's shoulder and sometimes the Unicorn nuzzled the King's cheek with his soft nose. They did not try to comfort one another with words. It wasn't very easy to think of anything to say that would be comforting. Tirian had never dreamed that one of the results of an Ape's setting up as a false Aslan would be to stop people from believing in the real one. He had felt quite sure that the Dwarfs would rally to his side the moment he showed them how they had been deceived. And then next night he would have led them to Stable Hill and shown Puzzle to all the creatures and everyone would have turned against the Ape and, perhaps after a scuffle with the Calormenes, the whole thing would have been over. But now, it seemed, he could count on nothing. How many other Narnians might turn the same way as the Dwarfs?

“Somebody's coming after us, I think,” said Puzzle suddenly.

They stopped and listened. Sure enough, there was a thump-thump of small feet behind them.

“Who goes there!” shouted the King.

“Only me, Sire,” came a voice. “Me, Poggin the Dwarf. I've only just managed to get away from the others. I'm on your side, Sire: and on Aslan's. If you can put a Dwarfish sword in my fist, I'd gladly strike a blow on the right side before all's done.”

Everyone crowded round him and welcomed him and praised him and slapped him on the back. Of course one single Dwarf could not make a very great difference, but it was somehow very cheering to have even one. The whole party brightened up. But Jill and Eustace didn't stay bright for very long, for they were now yawning their heads off and too tired to think about anything but bed.

It was at the coldest hour of the night, just before dawn, that they got back to the Tower. If there had been a meal ready for them they would have been glad enough to eat, but the bother and delay of getting one was not to be thought of. They drank from a stream, splashed their faces with water, and tumbled into their bunks, except for Puzzle and Jewel who said they'd be more comfortable outside. This perhaps was just as well, for a Unicorn and a fat, full-grown Donkey indoors always make a room feel rather crowded.

Narnian Dwarfs, though less than four feet high, are for their size about the toughest and strongest creatures there are, so that Poggin, in spite of a heavy day and a late night, woke fully refreshed before any of the others. He at once took Jill's bow, went out and shot a couple of wood pigeons. Then he sat plucking them on the doorstep and chatting to Jewel and Puzzle.

Puzzle looked and felt a good deal better this morning. Jewel, being a Unicorn and therefore one of the noblest and delicatest of beasts, had been very kind to him, talking to him about things of the sort they could both understand like grass and sugar and the care of one's hoofs.

When Jill and Eustace came out of the Tower yawning and rubbing their eyes at almost half past ten, the Dwarf showed them where they could gather plenty of a Narnian weed called Wild Fresney, which looks rather like our wood-sorrel but tastes a good deal nicer when cooked. (It needs a little butter and pepper to make it perfect, but they hadn't got these.) So that what with one thing and another, they had the makings of a capital stew for their breakfast or dinner, whichever you choose to call it. Tirian went a little further off into the wood with an axe and brought back some branches for fuel.

While the meal was cooking—which seemed a very long time, especially as it smelled nicer and nicer the nearer it came to being done—the King found a complete Dwarfish outfit for Poggin: mail shirt, helmet, shield, sword, belt, and dagger. Then he inspected Eustace's sword and found that Eustace had put it back in the sheath all messy from killing the Calormene. He was scolded for that and made to clean and polish it.

All this while Jill went to and fro, sometimes stirring the pot and sometimes looking out enviously at the Donkey and the Unicorn who were contentedly grazing. How many times that morning she wished she could eat grass!

But when the meal came everyone felt it had been worth waiting for, and there were second helpings all round.

When everyone had eaten as much as he could, the three humans and the Dwarf came and sat on the doorstep, the four-footed ones lay down facing them, the Dwarf (with permission both from Jill and from Tirian) lit his pipe, and the King said:

“Now, friend Poggin, you have more news of the enemy, belike, than we. Tell us all you know. And first, what tale do they tell of my escape?”

“As cunning a tale, Sire, as ever was devised,” said Poggin. “It was the Cat, Ginger, who told it, and most likely made it up too. This Ginger, Sire—oh, he's a slyboots if ever a cat was—said he was walking past the tree to which those villains bound your Majesty. And he said (saving your reverence) that you were howling and swearing and cursing Aslan: ‘language I wouldn't like to repeat’ were the words he used, looking ever so prim and proper you know the way a Cat can when it pleases. And then, says Ginger, Aslan himself suddenly appeared in a flash of lightning and swallowed your Majesty up at one mouthful.

“All the Beasts trembled at this story and some fainted right away. And of course the Ape followed it up. There, he says, see what Aslan does to those who don't respect him. Let that be a warning to you all. And the poor creatures wailed and whined and said, it will, it will. So that in the upshot your Majesty's escape has not set them thinking whether you still have loyal friends to aid you, but only made them more afraid and more obedient to the Ape.”

“What devilish policy!” said Tirian. “This Ginger, then, is close in the Ape's counsels.”

“It's more a question by now, Sire, if the Ape is in his counsels,” replied the Dwarf. “The Ape has taken to drinking, you see. My belief is that the plot is now mostly carried on by Ginger or Rishda—that's the Calormene captain. And I think some words that Ginger has scattered among the Dwarfs are chiefly to blame for the scurvy return they made you. And I'll tell you why.

“One of those dreadful midnight meetings had just broken up the night before last and I'd gone a bit of the way home when I found I'd left my pipe behind. It was a real good 'un, an old favourite, so I went back to look for it. But before I got to the place where I'd been sitting (it was black as pitch there) I heard a cat's voice say Mew and a Calormene voice say ‘here…speak softly,’ so I just stood as still as if I was frozen. And these two were Ginger and Rishda Tarkaan as they call him.

“‘Noble Tarkaan,’ said the Cat in that silky voice of his, ‘I just wanted to know exactly what we both meant today about Aslan meaning no more than Tash.’

“‘Doubtless, most sagacious of cats,’ says the other, ‘you have perceived my meaning.’ ‘You mean,’ says Ginger, ‘that there's no such person as either.’

“‘All who are enlightened know that,’ said the Tarkaan.

“‘Then we can understand one another,’ purrs the Cat. ‘Do you, like me, grow a little weary of the Ape?’

“‘A stupid, greedy brute,’ says the other, ‘but we must use him for the present. Thou and I must provide for all things in secret and make the Ape do our will.’

“‘And it would be better, wouldn't it,’ said Ginger, ‘to let some of the more enlightened Narnians into our counsels: one by one as we find them apt. For the Beasts who really believe in Aslan may turn at any moment: and will, if the Ape's folly betrays his secret. But those who care neither for Tash nor Aslan but have only an eye to their own profit and such reward as The Tisroc may give them when Narnia is a Calormene province, will be firm.’

“‘Excellent Cat,’ said the Captain. ‘But choose which ones carefully.’”

While the Dwarf had been speaking the day seemed to have changed. It had been sunny when they sat down. Now Puzzle shivered. Jewel shifted his head uneasily. Jill looked up.

“It's clouding over,” she said.

“And it's so cold,” said Puzzle.

“Cold enough, by the Lion!” said Tirian, blowing on his hands. “And faugh! What foul smell is this?”

“Phew!” gasped Eustace. “It's like something dead. Is there a dead bird somewhere about? And why didn't we notice it before?”

With a great upheaval Jewel scrambled to his feet and pointed with his horn.

“Look!” he cried. “Look at it! Look, look!”

Then all six of them saw; and over all their faces there came an expression of uttermost dismay.





Chapter 8　WHAT NEWS THE EAGLE BROUGHT


In the shadow of the trees on the far side of the clearing something was moving. It was gliding very slowly Northward. At a first glance you might have mistaken it for smoke, for it was grey and you could see things through it. But the deathly smell was not the smell of smoke. Also, this thing kept its shape instead of billowing and curling as smoke would have done. It was roughly the shape of a man but it had the head of a bird; some bird of prey with a cruel, curved beak. It had four arms which it held high above its head, stretching them out Northward as if it wanted to snatch all Narnia in its grip; and its fingers—all twenty of them—were curved like its beak and had long, pointed, bird-like claws instead of nails. It floated on the grass instead of walking, and the grass seemed to wither beneath it.

After one look at it Puzzle gave a screaming bray and darted into the Tower. And Jill (who was no coward, as you know) hid her face in her hands to shut out the sight of it. The others watched it for perhaps a minute, until it streamed away into the thicker trees on their right and disappeared. Then the sun came out again, and the birds once more began to sing.

Everyone started breathing properly again and moved. They had all been still as statues while it was in sight.

“What was it?” said Eustace in a whisper.

“I have seen it once before,” said Tirian. “But that time it was carved in stone and overlaid with gold and had solid diamonds for eyes. It was when I was no older than thou, and had gone as a guest to The Tisroc's court in Tashbaan. He took me into the great temple of Tash. There I saw it, carved above the altar.”

“Then that—that thing—was Tash?” said Eustace.

But instead of answering him Tirian slipped his arm behind Jill's shoulders and said, “How is it with you, Lady?”

“A—all right,” said Jill, taking her hands away from her pale face and trying to smile. “I'm all right. It only made me feel a little sick for a moment.”

“It seems, then,” said the Unicorn, “that there is a real Tash, after all.”

“Yes,” said the Dwarf. “And this fool of an Ape, who didn't believe in Tash, will get more than he bargained for! He called for Tash: Tash has come.”

“Where has it—he—the Thing—gone to?” said Jill.

“North into the heart of Narnia,” said Tirian. “It has come to dwell among us. They have called it and it has come.”

“Ho, ho, ho!” chuckled the Dwarf, rubbing his hairy hands together. “It will be a surprise for the Ape. People shouldn't call for demons unless they really mean what they say.”

“Who knows if Tash will be visible to the Ape?” said Jewel.

“Where has Puzzle got to?” said Eustace.

They all shouted out Puzzle's name and Jill went round to the other side of the Tower to see if he had gone there.

They were quite tired of looking for him when at last his large grey head peered cautiously out of the doorway and he said, “Has it gone away?” And when at last they got him to come out, he was shivering the way a dog shivers before a thunderstorm.

“I see now,” said Puzzle, “that I really have been a very bad donkey. I ought never to have listened to Shift. I never thought things like this would begin to happen.”

“If you'd spent less time saying you weren't clever and more time trying to be as clever as you could—” began Eustace but Jill interrupted him.

“Oh leave poor old Puzzle alone,” she said. “It was all a mistake; wasn't it, Puzzle dear?” And she kissed him on the nose.

Though rather shaken by what they had seen, the whole party now sat down again and went on with their talk.

Jewel had little to tell them. While he was a prisoner he had spent nearly all his time tied up at the back of the stable, and had of course heard none of the enemies' plans. He had been kicked (he'd done some kicking back too) and beaten and threatened with death unless he would say that he believed it was Aslan who was brought out and shown to them by firelight every night. In fact he was going to be executed this very morning if he had not been rescued. He didn't know what had happened to the Lamb.

The question they had to decide was whether they would go to Stable Hill again that night, show Puzzle to the Narnians and try to make them see how they had been tricked, or whether they should steal away Eastward to meet the help which Roonwit the Centaur was bringing up from Cair Paravel and return against the Ape and his Calormenes in force.

Tirian would very much like to have followed the first plan: he hated the idea of leaving the Ape to bully his people one moment longer than need be. On the other hand, the way the Dwarfs had behaved last night was a warning. Apparently one couldn't be sure how people would take it even if he showed them Puzzle. And there were the Calormene soldiers to be reckoned with. Poggin thought there were about thirty of them. Tirian felt sure that if the Narnians all rallied to his side, he and Jewel and the children and Poggin (Puzzle didn't count for much) would have a good chance of beating them. But how if half the Narnians—including all the Dwarfs—just sat and looked on? or even fought against him? The risk was too great. And there was, too, the cloudy shape of Tash. What might it do?

And then, as Poggin pointed out, there was no harm in leaving the Ape to deal with his own difficulties for a day or two. He would have no Puzzle to bring out and show now. It wasn't easy to see what story he—or Ginger could make up to explain that. If the Beasts asked night after night to see Aslan, and no Aslan was brought out, surely even the simplest of them would get suspicious.

In the end they all agreed that the best thing was to go off and try to meet Roonwit.

As soon as they had decided this, it was wonderful how much more cheerful everyone became. I don't honestly think that this was because any of them was afraid of a fight (except perhaps Jill and Eustace). But I daresay that each of them, deep down inside, was very glad not to go any nearer—or not yet—to that horrible bird-headed thing which, visible or invisible, was now probably haunting Stable Hill. Anyway, one always feels better when one has made up one's mind.

Tirian said they had better remove their disguises, as they didn't want to be mistaken for Calormenes and perhaps attacked by any loyal Narnians they might meet. The Dwarf made up a horrid-looking mess of ashes from the hearth and grease out of the jar of grease which was kept for rubbing on swords and spear-heads. Then they took off their Calormene armour and went down to the stream.

The nasty mixture made a lather just like soft soap: it was a pleasant, homely sight to see Tirian and the two children kneeling beside the water and scrubbing the backs of their necks or puffing and blowing as they splashed the lather off. Then they went back to the Tower with red, shiny faces, like people who have been given an extra good wash before a party. They re-armed themselves in true Narnian style, with straight swords and three-cornered shields. “Body of me,” said Tirian. “That is better. I feel a true man again.”

Puzzle begged very hard to have the lion-skin taken off him. He said it was too hot and the way it was rucked up on his back was uncomfortable: also, it made him look so silly. But they told him he would have to wear it a bit longer, for they still wanted to show him in that get-up to the other Beasts, even though they were now going to meet Roonwit first.

What was left of the pigeon-meat and rabbit-meat was not worth bringing away but they took some biscuits. Then Tirian locked the door of the Tower and that was the end of their stay there.

It was a little after two in the afternoon when they set out, and it was the first really warm day of that spring. The young leaves seemed to be much further out than yesterday: the snow-drops were over, but they saw several primroses. The sunlight slanted through the trees, birds sang, and always (though usually out of sight) there was the noise of running water. It was hard to think of horrible things like Tash. The children felt, “This is really Narnia at last.” Even Tirian's heart grew lighter as he walked ahead of them, humming an old Narnian marching song which had the refrain:

Ho, rumble, rumble, rumble,

Rumble drum belaboured.

After the King came Eustace and Poggin the Dwarf. Poggin was telling Eustace the names of all the Narnian trees, birds, and plants which he didn't know already. Sometimes Eustace would tell him about English ones.

After them came Puzzle, and after him Jill and Jewel walking very close together. Jill had, as you might say, quite fallen in love with the Unicorn. She thought—and she wasn't far wrong—that he was the shiningest, delicatest, most graceful animal she had ever met: and he was so gentle and soft of speech that, if you hadn't known, you would hardly have believed how fierce and terrible he could be in battle.

“Oh, this is nice!” said Jill. “Just walking along like this. I wish there could be more of this sort of adventure. It's a pity there's always so much happening in Narnia.”

But the Unicorn explained to her that she was quite mistaken. He said that the Sons and Daughters of Adam and Eve were brought out of their own strange world into Narnia only at times when Narnia was stirred and upset, but she mustn't think it was always like that. In between their visits there were hundreds and thousands of years when peaceful King followed peaceful King till you could hardly remember their names or count their numbers, and there was really hardly anything to put into the History Books. And he went on to talk of old Queens and heroes whom she had never heard of. He spoke of Swanwhite the Queen who had lived before the days of the White Witch and the Great Winter, who was so beautiful that when she looked into any forest pool the reflection of her face shone out of the water like a star by night for a year and a day afterwards. He spoke of Moonwood the Hare who had such ears that he could sit by Caldron Pool under the thunder of the great waterfall and hear what men spoke in whispers at Cair Paravel. He told how King Gale, who was ninth in descent from Frank the first of all Kings, had sailed far away into the Eastern seas and delivered the Lone Islanders from a dragon and how, in return, they had given him the Lone Islands to be part of the royal lands of Narnia for ever. He talked of whole centuries in which all Narnia was so happy that notable dances and feasts, or at most tournaments, were the only things that could be remembered, and every day and week had been better than the last. And as he went on, the picture of all those happy years, all the thousands of them, piled up in Jill's mind till it was rather like looking down from a high hill on to a rich, lovely plain full of woods and waters and cornfields, which spread away and away till it got thin and misty from distance. And she said:

“Oh, I do hope we can soon settle the Ape and get back to those good, ordinary times. And then I hope they'll go on for ever and ever and ever. Our world is going to have an end some day. Perhaps this one won't. Oh Jewel wouldn't it be lovely if Narnia just went on and on—like what you said it has been?”

“Nay, sister,” answered Jewel, “all worlds draw to an end, except Aslan's own country.”

“Well, at least,” said Jill, “I hope the end of this one is millions of millions of millions of years away—hallo! what are we stopping for?”

The King and Eustace and the Dwarf were all staring up at the sky. Jill shuddered, remembering what horrors they had seen already. But it was nothing of that sort this time. It was small, and looked black against the blue.

“I dare swear,” said the Unicorn, “from its flight, that it is a Talking bird.”

“So think I,” said the King. “But is it a friend, or a spy of the Ape's?”

“To me, Sire,” said the Dwarf, “it has a look of Far-sight the Eagle.”

“Ought we to hide under the trees?” said Eustace.

“Nay,” said Tirian, “best stand still as rocks. He would see us for certain if we moved.”

“Look! He wheels, he has seen us already,” said Jewel. “He is coming down in wide circles.”

“Arrow on string, Lady,” said Tirian to Jill. “But by no means shoot till I bid you. He may be a friend.”

If one had known what was going to happen next it would have been a treat to watch the grace and ease with which the huge bird glided down. He alighted on a rocky crag a few feet from Tirian, bowed his crested head, and said in his strange eagle's-voice, “Hail, King.”

“Hail, Farsight,” said Tirian. “And since you call me King, I may well believe you are not a follower of the Ape and his false Aslan. I am right glad of your coming.”

“Sire,” said the Eagle, “when you have heard my news you will be sorrier of my coming than of the greatest woe that ever befell you.”

Tirian's heart seemed to stop beating at these words, but he set his teeth and said, “Tell on.”

“Two sights have I seen,” said Farsight. “One was Cair Paravel filled with dead Narnians and living Calormenes: The Tisroc's banner advanced upon your royal battlements: and your subjects flying from the city—this way and that, into the woods. Cair Paravel was taken from the sea. Twenty great ships of Calormen put in there in the dark of the night before last night.”

No one could speak.

“And the other sight, five leagues nearer than Cair Paravel, was Roonwit the Centaur lying dead with a Calormene arrow in his side. I was with him in his last hour and he gave me this message to your Majesty: to remember that all worlds draw to an end and that noble death is a treasure which no one is too poor to buy.”

“So,” said the King, after a long silence, “Narnia is no more.”





Chapter 9　THE GREAT MEETING ON STABLE HILL


For, a long time they could not speak nor even shed a tear. Then the Unicorn stamped the ground with his hoof, and shook his mane, and spoke.

“Sire,” he said, “there is now no need of counsel. We see that the Ape's plans were laid deeper than we dreamed of. Doubtless he has been long in secret traffic with The Tisroc, and as soon as he had found the lion-skin he sent him word to make ready his navy for the taking of Cair Paravel and all Narnia. Nothing now remains for us seven but to go back to Stable Hill, proclaim the truth, and take the adventure that Aslan sends us. And if, by a great marvel, we defeat those thirty Calormenes who are with the Ape, then to turn again and die in battle with the far greater host of them that will soon march from Cair Paravel.”

Tirian nodded. But he turned to the children and said: “Now, friends, it is time for you to go hence into your own world. Doubtless you have done all that you were sent to do.”

“B—but we've done nothing,” said Jill who was shivering, not with fear exactly but because everything was so horrible.

“Nay,” said the King, “you loosed me from the tree: you glided before me like a snake last night in the wood and took Puzzle: and you, Eustace, killed your man. But you are too young to share in such a bloody end as we others must meet tonight or, it may be, three days hence. I entreat you—nay, I command you—to return to your own place. I should be put to shame if I let such young warriors fall in battle on my side.”

“No, no, no,” said Jill (very white when she began speaking and then suddenly very red and then white again). “We won't, I don't care what you say. We're going to stick to you whatever happens, aren't we, Eustace?”

“Yes, but there's no need to get so worked up about it,” said Eustace who had stuck his hands in his pockets (forgetting how very odd that looks when you are wearing a mail shirt). “Because, you see, we haven't any choice. What's the good of talking about our going back! How? We've got no magic for doing it!”

This was very good sense but, at the moment, Jill hated Eustace for saying it. He was fond of being dreadfully matter-of-fact when other people got excited.

When Tirian realized that the two strangers could not get home (unless Aslan suddenly whisked them away), he next wanted them to go across the Southern mountains into Archenland where they might possibly be safe. But they didn't know their way and there was no one to send with them. Also, as Poggin said, once the Calormenes had Narnia they would certainly take Archenland in the next week or so: The Tisroc had always wanted to have these Northern countries for his own. In the end Eustace and Jill begged so hard that Tirian said they could come with him and take their chance—or, as he much more sensibly called it, “the adventure that Aslan would send them.”

The King's first idea was that they should not go back to Stable Hill—they were sick of the very name of it by now till after dark. But the Dwarf told them that if they arrived there by daylight they would probably find the place deserted, except perhaps for a Calormene sentry. The Beasts were far too frightened by what the Ape (and Ginger) had told them about this new angry Aslan—or Tashlan—to go near it except when they were called together for these horrible midnight meetings. And Calormenes are never good woodsmen. Poggin thought that even by daylight they could easily get round to somewhere behind the stable without being seen. This would be much harder to do when the night had come and the Ape might be calling the Beasts together and all the Calormenes were on duty. And when the meeting did begin they could leave Puzzle at the back of the stable, completely out of sight, till the moment at which they wanted to produce him. This was obviously a good thing: for their only chance was to give the Narnians a sudden surprise.

Everyone agreed and the whole party set off on a new line—North-West—towards the hated Hill. The Eagle sometimes flew to and fro above them, sometimes he sat perched on Puzzle's back. No one—not even the King himself except in some great need—would dream of riding on a Unicorn.

This time Jill and Eustace walked together. They had been feeling very brave when they were begging to be allowed to come with the others, but now they didn't feel brave at all.

“Pole,” said Eustace in a whisper. “I may as well tell you I've got the wind up.”

“Oh you're all right, Scrubb,” said Jill. “You can fight. But I—I'm just shaking, if you want to know the truth.”

“Oh shaking's nothing,” said Eustace. “I'm feeling I'm going to be sick.”

“Don't talk about that, for goodness' sake,” said Jill.

They went on in silence for a minute or two.

“Pole,” said Eustace presently.

“What?” said she.

“What'll happen if we get killed here?”

“Well we'll be dead, I suppose.”

“But I mean, what will happen in our own world? Shall we wake up and find ourselves back in that train? Or shall we just vanish and never be heard of any more? Or shall we be dead in England?”

“Gosh. I never thought of that.”

“It'll be rum for Peter and the others if they saw me waving out of the window and then when the train comes in we're nowhere to be found! Or if they found two—I mean, if we're dead over there in England.”

“Ugh!” said Jill. “What a horrid idea.”

“It wouldn't be horrid for us,” said Eustace. “We shouldn't be there.”

“I almost wish—no I don't, though,” said Jill.

“What were you going to say?”

“I was going to say I wished we'd never come. But I don't, I don't, I don't. Even if we are killed. I'd rather be killed fighting for Narnia than grow old and stupid at home and perhaps go about in a bath-chair and then die in the end just the same.”

“Or be smashed up by British Railways!”

“Why d'you say that?”

“Well when that awful jerk came—the one that seemed to throw us into Narnia—I thought it was the beginning of a railway accident. So I was jolly glad to find ourselves here instead.”

While Jill and Eustace were talking about this, the others were discussing their plans and becoming less miserable. That was because they were now thinking of what was to be done this very night and the thought of what had happened to Narnia—the thought that all her glories and joys were over—was pushed away into the back part of their minds. The moment they stopped talking it would come out and make them wretched again: but they kept on talking. Poggin was really quite cheerful about the night's work they had to do. He was sure that the Boar and the Bear, and probably all the Dogs would come over to their side at once. And he couldn't believe that all the other Dwarfs would stick to Griffle. And fighting by firelight and in and out among trees would be an advantage to the weaker side. And then, if they could win tonight, need they really throw their lives away by meeting the main Calormene army a few days later?

Why not hide in the woods, or even up in the Western Waste beyond the great waterfall and live like outlaws? And then they might gradually get stronger and stronger, for Talking Beasts and Archenlanders would be joining them every day. And at last they'd come out of hiding and sweep the Calormenes (who would have got careless by then) out of the country and Narnia would be revived. After all, something very like that had happened in the time of King Miraz!

And Tirian heard all this and thought “But what about Tash?” and felt in his bones that none of it was going to happen. But he didn't say so.

When they got nearer to Stable Hill of course everyone became quiet. Then the real wood-work began. From the moment at which they first saw the Hill to the moment at which they all arrived at the back of the stable, it took them over two hours. It's the sort of thing one couldn't describe properly unless one wrote pages and pages about it. The journey from each bit of cover to the next was a separate adventure, and there were very long waits in between, and several false alarms. If you are a good Scout or a good Guide you will know already what it must have been like. By about sunset they were all safe in a clump of holly trees about fifteen yards behind the stable. They all munched some biscuit and lay down.

Then came the worst part, the waiting. Luckily for the children they slept for a couple of hours, but of course they woke up when the night grew cold, and what was worse, woke up very thirsty and with no chance of getting a drink. Puzzle just stood, shivering a little with nervousness, and said nothing. But Tirian, with his head against Jewel's flank, slept as soundly as if he were in his royal bed at Cair Paravel, till the sound of a gong beating awoke him and he sat up and saw that there was firelight on the far side of the stable and knew that the hour had come.

“Kiss me, Jewel,” he said. “For certainly this is our last night on earth. And if ever I offended against you in any matter great or small, forgive me now.”

“Dear King,” said the Unicorn, “I could almost wish you had, so that I might forgive it. Farewell. We have known great joys together. If Aslan gave me my choice I would choose no other life than the life I have had and no other death than the one we go to.”

Then they woke up Farsight, who was asleep with his head under his wing (it made him look as if he had no head at all), and crept forward to the stable. They left Puzzle (not without a kind word, for no one was angry with him now) just behind it, telling him not to move till someone came to fetch him, and took up their position at one end of the stable.

The bonfire had not been lit for long and was just beginning to blaze up. It was only a few feet away from them, and the great crowd of Narnian creatures were on the other side of it, so that Tirian could not at first see them very well, though of course he saw dozens of eyes shining with the reflection of the fire, as you've seen a rabbit's or cat's eyes in the headlights of a car. And just as Tirian took his place, the gong stopped beating and from somewhere on his left three figures appeared. One was Rishda Tarkaan the Calormene Captain. The second was the Ape. He was holding on to the Tarkaan's hand with one paw and kept whimpering and muttering, “Not so fast, don't go so fast, I'm not at all well. Oh my poor head! These midnight meetings are getting too much for me. Apes aren't meant to be up at night: It's not as if I was a rat or a bat—oh my poor head.”

On the other side of the Ape, walking very soft and stately, with his tail straight up in the air, came Ginger the Cat. They were heading for the bonfire and were so close to Tirian that they would have seen him at once if they had looked in the right direction. Fortunately they did not. But Tirian heard Rishda say to Ginger in a low voice:

“Now, Cat, to thy post. See thou play thy part well.”

“Miaow, miaow. Count on me!” said Ginger. Then he stepped away beyond the bonfire and sat down in the front row of the assembled Beasts: in the audience, as you might say.

For really, as it happened, the whole thing was rather like a theatre. The crowd of Narnians were like the people in the seats; the little grassy place just in front of the stable, where the bonfire burned and the Ape and the Captain stood to talk to the crowd, was like the stage; the stable itself was like the scenery at the back of the stage; and Tirian and his friends were like people peering round from behind the scenery. It was a splendid position. If any of them stepped forward into the full firelight, all eyes would be fixed on him at once: on the other hand, so long as they stood still in the shadow of the end-wall of the stable, it was a hundred to one against their being noticed.

Rishda Tarkaan dragged the Ape up close to the fire. The pair of them turned to face the crowd, and this of course meant that their backs were towards Tirian and his friends.

“Now, Monkey,” said Rishda Tarkaan in a low voice. “Say the words that wiser heads have put into thy mouth. And hold up thy head.” As he spoke he gave the Ape a little prod or kick from behind with the point of his toe.

“Do leave me alone,” muttered Shift. But he sat up straighter and began, in a louder voice—“Now listen, all of you. A terrible thing has happened. A wicked thing. The wickedest thing that ever was done in Narnia. And Aslan—”

“Tashlan, fool,” whispered Rishda Tarkaan.

“Tashlan I mean, of course,” said the Ape, “is very angry about it.”

There was a terrible silence while the Beasts waited to hear what new trouble was in store for them. The little party by the end-wall of the stable also held their breath. What on earth was coming now?

“Yes,” said the Ape. “At this very moment, when the Terrible One himself is among us—there in the stable just behind me-one wicked Beast has chosen to do what you'd think no one would dare to do even if He were a thousand miles away. It has dressed itself up in a lion-skin and is wandering about in these very woods pretending to be Aslan.”

Jill wondered for a moment if the Ape had gone mad. Was he going to tell the whole truth? A roar of horror and rage went up from the Beasts. “Grrr!” came the growls. “Who is he? Where is he? Just let me get my teeth into him!”

“It was seen last night,” screamed the Ape, “but it got away. It's a Donkey! A common, miserable Ass! If any of you see that Ass—”

“Grrr!” growled the Beasts. “We will, we will. He'd better keep out of our way.”

Jill looked at the King: his mouth was open and his face was full of horror. And then she understood the devilish cunning of the enemies' plan. By mixing a little truth with it they had made their lie far stronger. What was the good, now, of telling the Beasts that an ass had been dressed up as a lion to deceive them? The Ape would only say, “That's just what I've said.” What was the good of showing them Puzzle in his lion-skin? They would only tear him in pieces.

“That's taken the wind out of our sails,” whispered Eustace.

“The ground is taken from under our feet,” said Tirian.

“Cursed, cursed cleverness!” said Poggin. “I'll be sworn that this new lie is of Ginger's making.”





Chapter 10　WHO WILL GO INTO THE STABLE?


Jill felt something tickling her ear. It was Jewel the Unicorn, whispering to her with the wide whisper of a horse's mouth. As soon as she heard what he was saying she nodded and tip-toed back to where Puzzle was standing. Quickly and quietly she cut the last cords that bound the lion-skin to him. It wouldn't do for him to be caught with that on, after what the Ape had said! She would like to have hidden the skin somewhere very far away, but it was too heavy. The best she could do was to kick it in among the thickest bushes. Then she made signs to Puzzle to follow her and they both joined the others.

The Ape was speaking again.

“And after a horrid thing like that, Aslan—Tashlan—is angrier than ever. He says he's been a great deal too good to you, coming out every night to be looked at, see! Well, he's not coming out any more.”

Howls and mewings and squeals and grunts were the Animals' answer to this, but suddenly a quite different voice broke in with a loud laugh.

“Hark what the monkey says,” it shouted. “We know why he isn't going to bring his precious Aslan out. I'll tell you why: because he hasn't got him. He never had anything except an old donkey with a lion-skin on its back. Now he's lost that and he doesn't know what to do.”

Tirian could not see the faces on the other side of the fire very well but he guessed this was Griffle the Chief Dwarf. And he was quite certain of it when, a second later, all the Dwarfs' voices joined in, singing: “Don't know what to do! Don't know what to do! Don't know what to do-o-o!”

“Silence!” thundered Rishda Tarkaan. “Silence, children of mud! Listen to me, you other Narnians, lest I give command to my warriors to fall upon you with the edge of the sword. The Lord Shift has already told you of that wicked Ass. Do you think, because of him that there is no real Tashlan in the stable! Do you? Beware, beware.”

“No, no,” shouted most of the crowd. But the Dwarfs said, “That's right, Darkie, you've got it. Come on, Monkey, show us what's in the stable, seeing is believing.”

When next there was a moment's quiet the Ape said: “You Dwarfs think you're very clever, don't you? But not so fast. I never said you couldn't see Tashlan. Anyone who likes can see him.”

The whole assembly became silent. Then, after nearly a minute, the Bear began in a slow, puzzled voice:

“I don't quite understand all this,” it grumbled, “I thought you said—”

“You thought!” repeated the Ape. “As if anyone could call what goes on in your head thinking. Listen, you others. Anyone can see Tashlan. But he's not coming out. You have to go in and see him.”

“Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you,” said dozens of voices. “That's what we wanted! We can go in and see him face to face. And now he'll be kind and it will all be as it used to be.” And the Birds chattered, and the Dogs barked excitedly. Then suddenly, there was a great stirring and a noise of creatures rising to their feet, and in a second the whole lot of them would have been rushing forward and trying to crowd into the stable door all together.

But the Ape shouted: “Get back! Quiet! Not so fast.”

The Beasts stopped, many of them with one paw in the with tails wagging, and all of them with heads on one side.

“I thought you said,” began the Bear, but Shift interrupted.

“Anyone can go in,” he said. “But, one at a time. Who'll go first? He didn't say he was feeling very kind. He's been licking his lips a lot since he swallowed up the wicked King the other night. He's been growling a good deal this morning. I wouldn't much like to go into that stable myself tonight. But just as you please. Who'd like to go in first? Don't blame me if he swallows you whole or blasts you into a cinder with the mere terror of his eyes. That's your affair. Now then! Who's first? What about one of you Dwarfs?”

“Dilly, dilly, come and be killed!” sneered Griffle. “How do we know what you've got in there?”

“Ho-ho!” cried the Ape. “So you're beginning to think there's something there, eh? Well, all you Beasts were making noise enough a minute ago. What's struck you all dumb? Who's going in first?”

But the Beasts all stood looking at one another and began backing away from the stable. Very few tails were wagging now. The Ape waddled to and fro jeering at them. “Ho-ho-ho!” he chuckled. “I thought you were all so eager to see Tashlan face to face! Changed your mind, eh?”

Tirian bent his head to hear something that Jill was trying to whisper in his ear.

“What do you think is really inside the stable?” she said.

“Who knows?” said Tirian. “Two Calormenes with drawn swords, as likely as not, one on each side of the door.”

“You don't think,” said Jill, “it might be…you know…that horrid thing we saw?”

“Tash himself?” whispered Tirian. “There's no knowing. But courage, child: we are all between the paws of the true Aslan.”

Then a most surprising thing happened. Ginger the Cat said in a cool, clear voice, not at all as if he was excited, “I'll go in, if you like.”

Every creature turned and fixed its eyes on the Cat.

“Mark their subtleties, Sire,” said Poggin to the King. “This cursed cat is in the plot, in the very centre of it. Whatever is in the stable will not hurt him, I'll be bound. Then Ginger will come out again and say that he has seen some wonder.”

But Tirian had no time to answer him. The Ape was calling the Cat to come forward.

“Ho-ho!” said the Ape. “So you, a pert Puss, would look upon him face to face. Come on, then! I'll open the door for you. Don't blame me if he scares the whiskers off your face. That's your affair.”

And the Cat got up and came out of its place in the crowd, walking primly and daintily, with its tail in the air, not one hair on its sleek coat out of place. It came on till it had passed the fire and was so close that Tirian, from where he stood with his shoulder against the end-wall of the stable, could look right into its face. Its big green eyes never blinked. (“Cool as a cucumber,” muttered Eustace. “It knows it has nothing to fear.”)

The Ape, chuckling and making faces, shuttled across beside the Cat: put up his paw: drew the bolt and opened the door. Tirian thought he could hear the Cat purring as it walked into the dark doorway.

“Aii-aii-aouwee!—” The most horrible caterwaul you ever heard made everyone jump. You have been wakened yourself by cats quarrelling or making love on the roof in the middle of the night: you know the sound.

This was worse. The Ape was knocked head over heels by Ginger coming back out of the stable at top speed. If you had not known he was a cat, you might have thought he was a ginger-coloured streak of lightning. He shot across the open grass, back into the crowd. No one wants to meet a cat in that state. You could see animals getting out of his way to left and right. He dashed up a tree, whisked around, and hung head downwards. His tail was bristled out till it was nearly as thick as his whole body: his eyes were like saucers of green fire: along his back every single hair stood on end.

“I'd give my beard,” whispered Poggin, “to know whether that brute is only acting or whether it has really found something in there that frightened it!”

“Peace, friend,” said Tirian, for the Captain and the Ape were also whispering and he wanted to hear what they said. He did not succeed, except that he heard the Ape once more whimpering “My head, my head,” but he got the idea that those two were almost as puzzled by the cat's behaviour as himself.

“Now, Ginger,” said the Captain. “Enough of that noise. Tell them what thou hast seen.”

“Aii—Aii—Aaow—Awah,” screamed the Cat.

“Art thou not called a Talking Beast?” said the Captain. “Then hold thy devilish noise and talk.”

What followed was rather horrible. Tirian felt quite certain (and so did the others) that the Cat was trying to say something: but nothing came out of his mouth except the ordinary, ugly cat-noises you might hear from any angry or frightened old Tom in a backyard in England. And the longer he caterwauled the less like a Talking Beast he looked. Uneasy whimperings and little sharp squeals broke out from among the other Animals.

“Look, look!” said the voice of the Bear. “It can't talk. It has forgotten how to talk! It has gone back to being a dumb beast. Look at its face.”

Everyone saw that it was true. And then the greatest terror of all fell upon those Narnians. For every one of them had been taught—when it was only a chick or a puppy or a cub—how Aslan at the beginning of the world had turned the beasts of Narnia into Talking Beasts and warned them that if they weren't good they might one day be turned back again and be like the poor witless animals one meets in other countries.

“And now it is coming upon us,” they moaned.

“Mercy! Mercy!” wailed the Beasts. “Spare us, Lord Shift, stand between us and Aslan, you must always go in and speak to him for us. We daren't, we daren't.”

Ginger disappeared further up into the tree. No one ever saw him again.

Tirian stood with his hand on his sword-hilt and his head bowed. He was dazed with the horrors of that night. Sometimes he thought it would be best to draw his sword at once and rush upon the Calormenes: then next moment he thought it would be better to wait and see what new turn affairs might take. And now a new turn came.

“My Father,” came a clear, ringing voice from the left of the crowd. Tirian knew at once that it was one of the Calormenes speaking, for in The Tisroc's army the common soldiers call the officers “My Master” but the officers call their senior officers “My Father”. Jill and Eustace didn't know this but, after looking this way and that, they saw the speaker, for of course people at the sides of the crowd were easier to see than people in the middle where the glare of the fire made all beyond it look rather black. He was young and tall and slender, and even rather beautiful in the dark, haughty, Calormene way.

“My Father,” he said to the Captain, “I also desire to go in.”

“Peace, Emeth,” said the Captain, “Who called thee to counsel? Does it become a boy to speak?”

“My Father,” said Emeth. “Truly I am younger than thou, yet I also am of the blood of the Tarkaans even as thou art, and I also am the servant of Tash. Therefore . . .”

“Silence,” said Rishda Tarkaan. “Am not I thy Captain? Thou hast nothing to do with this stable. It is for the Narnians.”

“Nay, my Father,” answered Emeth. “Thou hast said that their Aslan and our Tash are all one. And if that is the truth, then Tash himself is in yonder. And how then sayest thou that I have nothing to do with him? For gladly would I die a thousand deaths if I might look once on the face of Tash.”

“Thou art a fool and understandest nothing,” said Rishda Tarkaan. “These be high matters.”

Emeth's face grew sterner. “Is it then not true that Tash and Aslan are all one?” he asked. “Has the Ape lied to us?”

“Of course they're all one,” said the Ape.

“Swear it, Ape,” said Emeth.

“Oh dear!” whimpered Shift, “I wish you'd all stop bothering me. My head does ache. Yes, yes, I swear it.”

“Then, my Father,” said Emeth, “I am utterly determined to go in.”

“Fool,” began Rishda Tarkaan, but at once the Dwarfs began shouting: “Come along, Darkie. Why don't you let him in? Why do you let Narnians in and keep your own people out? What have you got in there that you don't want your own men to meet?”

Tirian and his friends could only see the back of Rishda Tarkaan, so they never knew what his face looked like as he shrugged his shoulders and said, “Bear witness all that I am guiltless of this young fool's blood. Get thee in, rash boy, and make haste.”

Then, just as Ginger had done, Emeth came walking forward into the open strip of grass between the bonfire and the stable. His eyes were shining, his face very solemn, his hand was on his sword-hilt, and he carried his head high. Jill felt like crying when she looked at his face. And Jewel whispered in the King's ear, “By the Lion's Mane, I almost love this young warrior, Calormene though he be. He is worthy of a better god than Tash.”

“I do wish we knew what is really inside there,” said Eustace.

Emeth opened the door and went in, into the black mouth of the stable. He closed the door behind him. Only a few moments passed—but it seemed longer before the door opened again. A figure in Calormene armour reeled out, fell on its back, and lay still: the door closed behind it. The Captain leaped towards it and bent down to stare at its face. He gave a start of surprise. Then he recovered himself and turned to the crowd, crying out:

“The rash boy has had his will. He has looked on Tash and is dead. Take warning, all of you.”

“We will, we will,” said the poor Beasts. But Tirian and his friends stared at the dead Calormene and then at one another. For they, being so close, could see what the crowd, being further off and beyond the fire, could not see: this dead man was not Emeth. He was quite different: an older man, thicker and not so tall, with a big beard.

“Ho-ho-ho,” chuckled the Ape. “Any more? Anyone else want to go in? Well, as you're all shy, I'll choose the next. You, you Boar! On you come. Drive him up, Calormenes. He shall see Tashlan face to face.”

“O-o-mph,” grunted the Boar, rising heavily to his feet. “Come on, then. Try my tusks.”

When Tirian saw that brave Beast getting ready to fight for its life-and Calormene soldiers beginning to close in on it with their drawn scimitars—and no one going to its help—something seemed to burst inside him. He no longer cared if this was the best moment to interfere or not.

“Swords out,” he whispered to the others. “Arrow on string. Follow.”

Next moment the astonished Narnians saw seven figures leap forth in front of the stable, four of them in shining mail. The King's sword flashed in the firelight as he waved it above his head and cried in a great voice:

“Here stand I, Tirian of Narnia, in Aslan's name, to prove with my body that Tash is a foul fiend, the Ape a manifold traitor, and these Calormenes worthy of death. To my side, all true Narnians. Would you wait till your new masters have killed you all one by one?”





Chapter 11　THE PACE QUICKENS


Quick as lightning, Rishda Tarkaan leaped back out of reach of the King's sword. He was no coward, and would have fought single-handed against Tirian and the Dwarf if need were. But he could not take on the Eagle and the Unicorn as well. He knew how Eagles can fly into your face and peck at your eyes and blind you with their wings. And he had heard from his father (who had met Narnians in battle) that no man, except with arrows, or a long spear, can match a Unicorn, for it rears on its hind legs as it falls upon you and then you have its hoofs and its horn and its teeth to deal with all at once. So he rushed into the crowd and stood calling out:

“To me, to me, warriors of The Tisroc, may-he-live-forever. To me, all loyal Narnians, lest the wrath of Tashlan fall upon you!”

While this was happening two other things happened as well. The Ape had not realized his danger as quickly as the Tarkaan. For a second or so he remained squatting beside the fire staring at the newcomers. Then Tirian rushed upon the wretched creature, picked it up by the scruff of the neck, and dashed back to the stable shouting, “Open the door!” Poggin opened it. “Go and drink your own medicine, Shift!” said Tirian and hurled the Ape through into the darkness. But as the Dwarf banged the door shut again, a blinding greenish-blue light shone out from the inside of the stable, the earth shook, and there was a strange noise—a clucking and screaming as if it was the hoarse voice of some monstrous bird.

The Beasts moaned and howled and called out “Tashlan! Hide us from him!” and many fell down, and many hid their faces in their wings or paws. No one except Farsight the Eagle, who has the best eyes of all living things, noticed the face of Rishda Tarkaan at that moment. And from what Farsight saw there he knew at once that Rishda was just as surprised, and nearly frightened, as everyone else.

“There goes one,” thought Farsight, “who has called on gods he does not believe in. How will it be with him if they have really come?”

The third thing—which also happened at the same moment—was the only really beautiful thing that night. Every single Talking Dog in the whole meeting (there were fifteen of them) came bounding and barking joyously to the King's side. They were mostly great big dogs with thick shoulders and heavy jaws. Their coming was like the breaking of a great wave on the seabeach: it nearly knocked you down. For though they were Talking Dogs they were just as doggy as they could be: and they all stood up and put their front paws on the shoulders of the humans and licked their faces, all saying at once: “Welcome! Welcome! We'll help, we'll help, help, help. Show us how to help, show us how, how. How—how—how?”

It was so lovely that it made you want to cry. This, at last, was the sort of thing they had been hoping for. And when, a moment later, several little animals (mice and moles and a squirrel or so) came pattering up, squealing with joy, and saying “See, see. We're here,” and when, after that, the Bear and the Boar came too, Eustace began to feel that perhaps, after all, everything might be going to come right. But Tirian gazed round and saw how very few of the animals had moved.

“To me! to me!” he called. “Have you all turned cowards since I was your King?”

“We daren't,” whimpered dozens of voices. “Tashlan would be angry. Shield us from Tashlan.”

“Where are all the Talking Horses?” said Tirian to the Boar.

“We've seen, we've seen,” squealed the Mice. “The Ape has made them work. They're all tied—down at the bottom of the hill.”

“Then all you little ones,” said Tirian, “you nibblers and gnawers and nutcrackers, away with you as fast as you can scamper and see if the Horses are on our side. And if they are, get your teeth into the ropes and gnaw till the Horses are free and bring them hither.”

“With a good will, Sire,” came the small voices, and with a whisk of tails those sharp-eyed and sharp-toothed folk were off. Tirian smiled for mere love as he saw them go. But it was already time to be thinking of other things. Rishda Tarkaan was giving his orders.

“Forward,” he said. “Take all of them alive if you can and hurl them into the stable or drive them into it. When they are all in we will put fire to it and make them an offering to the great god Tash.”

“Ha!” said Farsight to himself. “So that is how he hopes to win Tash's pardon for his unbelief.”

The enemy line—about half of Rishda's force—was now moving forward, and Tirian had barely time to give his orders.

“Out on the left, Jill, and try to shoot all you may before they reach us. Boar and Bear next to her. Poggin on my left, Eustace on my right. Hold the right wing, Jewel. Stand by him, Puzzle, and use your hoofs. Hover and strike, Farsight. You Dogs, just behind us. Go in among them after the sword—play has begun. Aslan to our aid!”

Eustace stood with his heart beating terribly, hoping and hoping that he would be brave. He had never seen anything (though he had seen both a dragon and a seaserpent) that made his blood run so cold as that line of dark-faced bright-eyed men. There were fifteen Calormenes, a Talking Bull of Narnia, Slinkey the Fox, and Wraggle the Satyr. Then he heard twang-and-zipp on his left and one Calormene fell: then twang-and-zipp again and the Satyr was down. “Oh, well done, daughter!” came Tirian's voice; and then the enemy were upon them.

Eustace could never remember what happened in the next two minutes. It was all like a dream (the sort you have when your temperature is over 100) until he heard Rishda Tarkaan's voice calling out from the distance:

“Retire. Back hither and re-form.”

Then Eustace came to his senses and saw the Calormenes scampering back to their friends. But not all of them. Two lay dead, pierced by Jewel's horn, one by Tirian's sword. The Fox lay dead at his own feet, and he wondered if it was he who had killed it. The Bull also was down, shot through the eye by an arrow from Jill and gashed in his side by the Boar's tusk. But our side had its losses too. Three dogs were killed and a fourth was hobbling behind the line on three legs and whimpering. The Bear lay on the ground, moving feebly. Then it mumbled in its throaty voice, bewildered to the last, “I—I don't—understand,” laid its big head down on the grass as quietly as a child going to sleep, and never moved again.

In fact, the first attack had failed. Eustace didn't seem able to be glad about it: he was so terribly thirsty and his arm ached so.

As the defeated Calormenes went back to their commander, the Dwarfs began jeering at them.

“Had enough, Darkies?” they yelled. “Don't you like it? Why doesn't your great Tarkaan go and fight himself instead of sending you to be killed? Poor Darkies!”

“Dwarfs,” cried Tirian. “Come here and use your swords, not your tongues. There is still time. Dwarfs of Narnia! You can fight well, I know. Come back to your allegiance.”

“Yah!” sneered the Dwarfs. “Not likely. You're just as big humbugs as the other lot. We don't want any Kings. The Dwarfs are for the Dwarfs. Boo!”

Then the Drum began: not a Dwarf drum this time, but a big bull's hide Calormene drum. The children from the very first hated the sound. Boom—boom—ba-ba-boom it went. But they would have hated it far worse if they had known what it meant. Tirian did. It meant that there were other Calormene troops somewhere near and that Rishda Tarkaan was calling them to his aid. Tirian and Jewel looked at one another sadly. They had just begun to hope that they might win that night: but it would be all over with them if new enemies appeared.

Tirian gazed despairingly round. Several Narnians were standing with the Calormenes, whether through treachery or in honest fear of “Tashlan”. Others were sitting still, staring, not likely to join either side. But there were fewer animals now: the crowd was much smaller. Clearly, several of them had just crept quietly away during the fighting.

Boom—boom—ba-ba-boom went the horrible drum. Then another sound began to mix with it. “Listen!” said Jewel: and then “Look!” said Farsight. A moment later there was no doubt what it was. With a thunder of hoofs, with tossing heads, widened nostrils, and waving manes, over a score of Talking Horses of Narnia came charging up the hill. The gnawers and nibblers had done their work.

Poggin the Dwarf and the children opened their mouths to cheer but that cheer never came. Suddenly the air was full of the sound of twanging bow-strings and hissing arrows. It was the Dwarfs who were shooting and—for a moment Jill could hardly believe her eyes—they were shooting the Horses. Dwarfs are deadly archers. Horse after Horse rolled over. Not one of those noble Beasts ever reached the King.

“Little Swine,” shrieked Eustace, dancing in his rage. “Dirty, filthy, treacherous little brutes.”

Even Jewel said, “Shall I run after those Dwarfs, Sire, and spit ten of them on my horn at each plunge?”

But Tirian with his face as stern as stone, said, “Stand fast, Jewel. If you must weep, sweetheart (this was to Jill), turn your face aside and see you wet not your bow-string. And peace, Eustace. Do not scold, like a kitchen-girl. No warrior scolds. Courteous words or else hard knocks are his only language.”

But the Dwarfs jeered back at Eustace. “That was a surprise for you, little boy, eh? Thought we were on your side, did you? No fear. We don't want any Talking Horses. We don't want you to win any more than the other gang. You can't take us in. The Dwarfs are for the Dwarfs.”

Rishda Tarkaan was still talking to his men, doubtless making arrangements for the next attack and probably wishing he had sent his whole force into the first. The drum boomed on. Then, to their horror, Tirian and his friends heard, far fainter as if from a long way off, an answering drum. Another body of Calormenes had heard Rishda's signal and were coming to support him. You would not have known from Tirian's face that he had now given up all hope.

“Listen,” he whispered in a matter-of-fact voice, “we must attack now, before yonder miscreants are strengthened by their friends.”

“Bethink you, Sire,” said Poggin, “that here we have the good wooden wall of the stable at our backs. If we advance, shall we not be encircled and get sword-points between our shoulders?”

“I would say as you do, Dwarf,” said Tirian. “Were it not their very plan to force us into the stable? The further we are from its deadly door, the better.”

“The King is right,” said Farsight. “Away from this accursed stable, and whatever goblin lives inside it, at all costs.”

“Yes, do let's,” said Eustace. “I'm coming to hate the very sight of it.”

“Good,” said Tirian. “Now look yonder to our left. You see a great rock that gleams white like marble in the firelight. First we will fall upon those Calormenes. You, maiden, shall move out on our left and shoot as fast as ever you may into their ranks: and you, Eagle, fly at their faces from the right. Meanwhile we others will be charging them. When we are so close, Jill, that you can no longer shoot at them for fear of striking us, go back to the white rock and wait. You others, keep your ears wide even in the fighting. We must put them to flight in a few minutes or else not at all, for we are fewer than they. As soon as I call Back, then rush to join Jill at the white rock, where we shall have protection behind us and can breathe awhile. Now, be off, Jill.”

Feeling terribly alone, Jill ran out about twenty feet, put her right leg back and her left leg forward, and set an arrow to her string. She wished her hands were not shaking so.

“That's a rotten shot!” she said as her first arrow sped towards the enemy and flew over their heads. But she had another on the string next moment: she knew that speed was what mattered. She saw something big and black darting into the faces of the Calormenes. That was Farsight. First one man, and then another, dropped his sword and put up both his hands to defend his eyes. Then one of her own arrows hit a man, and another hit a Narnian wolf, who had, it seemed, joined the enemy.

But she had been shooting only for a few seconds when she had to stop. With a flash of swords and of the Boar's tusks and Jewel's horn, and with deep baying from the dogs, Tirian and his party were rushing on their enemies, like men in a hundred yards' race. Jill was astonished to see how unprepared the Calormenes seemed to be. She did not realize that this was the result of her work and the Eagle's. Very few troops can keep on looking steadily to the front if they are getting arrows in their faces from one side and being pecked by an eagle on the other.

“Oh well done. Well done!” shouted Jill. The King's party were cutting their way right into the enemy. The Unicorn was tossing men as you'd toss hay on a fork. Even Eustace seemed to Jill (who after all didn't know very much about swordsmanship) to be fighting brilliantly. The Dogs were at the Calormenes' throats. It was going to work! It was victory at last—

With a horrible, cold shock Jill noticed a strange thing. Though Calormenes were falling at each Narnian sword-stroke, they never seemed to get any fewer. In fact, there were actually more of them now than when the fight began. There were more every second. They were running up from every side. They were new Calormenes. These new ones had spears. There was such a crowd of them that she could hardly see her own friends. Then she heard Tirian's voice crying:

“Back! To the rock!”

The enemy had been reinforced. The drum had done its work.





Chapter 12　THROUGH THE STABLE DOOR


Jill ought to have been back at the white rock already but she had quite forgotten that part of her orders in the excitement of watching the fight. Now she remembered. She turned at once and ran to it, and arrived there barely a second before the others. It thus happened that all of them, for a moment, had their backs to the enemy. They all wheeled round the moment they had reached it. A terrible sight met their eyes.

A Calormene was running towards the stable door carrying something that kicked and struggled. As he came between them and the fire they could see clearly both the shape of the man and the shape of what he carried. It was Eustace.

Tirian and the Unicorn rushed out to rescue him. But the Calormene was now far nearer to the door then they. Before they had covered half the distance he had flung Eustace in and shut the door on him. Half a dozen more Calormenes had run up behind him. They formed a line on the open space before the stable. There was no getting at it now.

Even then Jill remembered to keep her face turned aside, well away from her bow. “Even if I can't stop blubbing, I won't get my string wet,” she said.

“Ware arrows,” said Poggin suddenly.

Everyone ducked and pulled his helmet well over his nose. The Dogs crouched behind. But though a few arrows came their way it soon became clear that they were not being shot at. Griffle and his Dwarfs were at their archery again. This time they were coolly shooting at the Calormenes.

“Keep it up, boys!” came Griffle's voice. “All together. Carefully. We don't want Darkies any more than we want Monkeys—or Lions—or Kings. The Dwarfs are for the Dwarfs.”

Whatever else you may say about Dwarfs, no one can say they aren't brave. They could easily have got away to some safe place. They preferred to stay and kill as many of both sides as they could, except when both sides were kind enough to save them trouble by killing one another. They wanted Narnia for their own.

What perhaps they had not taken into account was that the Calormenes were mail-clad and the Horses had had no protection. Also the Calormenes had a leader. Rishda Tarkaan's voice cried out:

“Thirty of you keep watch on those fools by the white rock. The rest, after me, that we may teach these sons of earth a lesson.”

Tirian and his friends, still panting from their fight and thankful for a few minutes' rest, stood and looked on while the Tarkaan led his men against the Dwarfs. It was a strange scene by now. The fire had sunk lower: the light it gave was now less and of a darker red. As far as one could see, the whole place of assembly was now empty except for the Dwarf and the Calormenes. In that light one couldn't make out much of what was happening. It sounded as if the Dwarfs were putting up a good fight. Tirian could hear Griffle using dreadful language, and every now and then the Tarkaan calling, “Take all you can alive! Take them alive!”

Whatever that fight may have been like, it did not last long. The noise of it died away. Then Jill saw the Tarkaan coming back to the stable: eleven men followed him, dragging eleven bound Dwarfs. (Whether the others had all been killed, or whether some of them had got away, was never known.)

“Throw them into the shrine of Tash,” said Rishda Tarkaan.

And when the eleven Dwarfs, one after the other, had been flung or kicked into that dark doorway and the door had been shut again, he bowed low to the stable and said:

“These also are for thy burnt offering, Lord Tash.”

And all the Calormenes banged the flats of their swords on their shields and shouted, “Tash! Tash! The great god Tash! Inexorable Tash!” (There was no nonsense about “Tashlan” now.)

The little party by the white rock watched these doings and whispered to one another. They had found a trickle of water coming down the rock and all had drunk eagerly—Jill and Poggin and the King in their hands, while the four-footed ones lapped from the little pool which it had made at the foot of the stone. Such was their thirst that it seemed the most delicious drink they had ever had in their lives, and while they were drinking they were perfectly happy and could not think of anything else.

“I feel in my bones,” said Poggin, “that we shall all, one by one, pass through that dark door before morning. I can think of a hundred deaths I would rather have died.”

“It is indeed a grim door,” said Tirian. “It is more like a mouth.”

“Oh, can't we do anything to stop it?” said Jill in a shaken voice.

“Nay, fair friend,” said Jewel, nosing her gently. “It may be for us the door to Aslan's country and we shall sup at his table tonight.”

Rishda Tarkaan turned his back on the stable and walked slowly to a place in front of the white rock.

“Hearken,” he said. “If the Boar and the Dogs and the Unicorn will come over to me and put themselves in my mercy, their lives shall be spared. The Boar shall go to a cage in The Tisroc's garden, the Dogs to The Tisroc's kennels, and the Unicorn, when I have sawn his horn off, shall draw a cart. But the Eagle, the children, and he who was the King shall be offered to Tash this night.”

The only answer was growls.

“Get on, warriors,” said the Tarkaan. “Kill the beasts, but take the two-legged ones alive.”

And then the last battle of the last King of Narnia began.

What made it hopeless, even apart from the numbers of the enemy, was the spears. The Calormenes who had been with the Ape almost from the beginning had had no spears: that was because they had come into Narnia by ones and twos, pretending to be peaceful merchants, and of course they had carried no spears for a spear is not a thing you can hide. The new ones must have come in later, after the Ape was already strong and they could march openly. The spears made all the difference. With a long spear you can kill a boar before you are in reach of his tusks and a unicorn before you are in reach of his horn; if you are very quick and keep your head. And now the levelled spears were closing in on Tirian and his last friends. Next minute they were all fighting for their lives.

In a way it wasn't quite so bad as you might think. When you are using every muscle to the full—ducking under a spear-point here, leaping over it there, lunging forward, drawing back, wheeling round—you haven't much time to feel either frightened or sad.

Tirian knew he could do nothing for the others now; they were all doomed together. He vaguely saw the Boar go down on one side of him, and Jewel fighting furiously on the other. Out of the corner of one eye he saw, but only just saw, a big Calormene pulling Jill away somewhere by her hair. But he hardly thought about any of these things. His only thought now was to sell his life as dearly as he could. The worst of it was that he couldn't keep to the position in which he had started, under the white rock. A man who is fighting a dozen enemies at once must take his chances wherever he can; must dart in wherever he sees an enemy's breast or neck unguarded. In a very few strokes this may get you quite a distance from the spot where you began. Tirian soon found that he was getting further and further to the right, nearer to the stable. He had a vague idea in his mind that there was some good reason for keeping away from it. But he couldn't now remember what the reason was. And anyway, he couldn't help it.

All at once everything came quite clear. He found he was fighting the Tarkaan himself. The bonfire (what was left of it) was straight in front. He was in fact fighting in the very doorway of the stable, for it had been opened and two Calormenes were holding the door, ready to slam it shut the moment he was inside. He remembered everything now, and he realized that the enemy had been edging him to the stable on purpose ever since the fight began. And while he was thinking this he was still fighting the Tarkaan as hard as he could.

A new idea came into Tirian's head. He dropped his sword, darted forward, in under the sweep of the Tarkaan's scimitar, seized his enemy by the belt with both hands, and jumped back into the stable, shouting:

“Come in and meet Tash yourself!”

There was a deafening noise. As when the Ape had been flung in, the earth shook and there was a blinding light.

The Calormene soldiers outside screamed. “Tash, Tash!” and banged the door. If Tash wanted their own Captain, Tash must have him. They, at any rate, did not want to meet Tash.

For a moment or two Tirian did not know where he was or even who he was. Then he steadied himself, blinked, and looked around. It was not dark inside the stable, as he had expected. He was in strong light: that was why he was blinking.

He turned to look at Rishda Tarkaan, but Rishda was not looking at him. Rishda gave a great wail and pointed; then he put his hands before his face and fell flat, face downwards, on the ground. Tirian looked in the direction where the Tarkaan had pointed. And then he understood.

A terrible figure was coming towards them. It was far smaller than the shape they had seen from the Tower, though still much bigger than a man, and it was the same. It had a vulture's head and four arms. Its beak was open and its eyes blazed. A croaking voice came from its beak.

“Thou hast called me into Narnia, Rishda Tarkaan. Here I am. What hast thou to say?”

But the Tarkaan neither lifted his face from the ground nor said a word. He was shaking like a man with a bad hiccup. He was brave enough in battle: but half his courage had left him earlier that night when he first began to suspect that there might be a real Tash. The rest of it had left him now.

With a sudden jerk—like a hen stooping to pick up a worm—Tash pounced on the miserable Rishda and tucked him under the upper of his two right arms. Then Tash turned his head sidewise to fix Tirian with one of his terrible eyes: for of course, having a bird's head, he couldn't look at you straight.

But immediately, from behind Tash, strong and calm as the summer sea, a voice said:

“Begone, Monster, and take your lawful prey to your own place: in the name of Aslan and Aslan's great Father the Emperor-over-the-Sea.”

The hideous creature vanished, with the Tarkaan still under its arm. And Tirian turned to see who had spoken. And what he saw then set his heart beating as it had never beaten in any fight.

Seven Kings and Queens stood before him, all with crowns on their heads and all in glittering clothes, but the Kings wore fine mail as well and had their swords drawn in their hands.

Tirian bowed courteously and was about to speak when the youngest of the Queens laughed. He stared hard at her face, and then gasped with amazement, for he knew her. It was Jill: but not Jill as he had last seen her, with her face all dirt and tears and an old drill dress half slipping off one shoulder. Now she looked cool and fresh, as fresh as if she had just come from bathing. And at first he thought she looked older, but then didn't, and he could never make up his mind on that point. And then he saw that the youngest of the Kings was Eustace: but he also was changed as Jill was changed.

Tirian suddenly felt awkward about coming among these people with the blood and dust and sweat of a battle still on him. Next moment he realized that he was not in that state at all. He was fresh and cool and clean, and dressed in such clothes as he would have worn for a great feast at Cair Paravel. (But in Narnia your good clothes were never your uncomfortable ones. They knew how to make things that felt beautiful as well as looking beautiful in Narnia: and there was no such thing as starch or flannel or elastic to be found from one end of the country to the other.)

“Sire,” said Jill coming forward and making a beautiful curtsey, “let me make you known to Peter the High King over all Kings in Narnia.”

Tirian had no need to ask which was the High King, for he remembered his face (though here it was far nobler) from his dream. He stepped forward, sank on one knee and kissed Peter's hand.

“High King,” he said. “You are welcome to me.”

And the High King raised him and kissed him on both cheeks as a High King should. Then he led him to the eldest of the Queens—but even she was not old, and there were no grey hairs on her head and no wrinkles on her cheek—and said, “Sir, this is that Lady Polly who came into Narnia on the First Day, when Aslan made the trees grow and the Beasts talk.”

He brought him next to a man whose golden beard flowed over his breast and whose face was full of wisdom. “And this,” he said, “is the Lord Digory who was with her on that day. And this is my brother, King Edmund: and this my sister, the Queen Lucy.”

“Sir,” said Tirian, when he had greeted all these. “If I have read the chronicle aright, there should be another. Has not your Majesty two sisters? Where is Queen Susan?”

“My sister Susan,” answered Peter shortly and gravely, “is no longer a friend of Narnia.”

“Yes,” said Eustace, “and whenever you've tried to get her to come and talk about Narnia or do anything about Narnia, she says, ‘What wonderful memories you have! Fancy your still thinking about all those funny games we used to play when we were children.’”

“Oh Susan!” said Jill. “She's interested in nothing nowadays except nylons and lipstick and invitations. She always was a jolly sight too keen on being grown-up.”

“Grown-up, indeed,” said the Lady Polly. “I wish she would grow up. She wasted all her school time wanting to be the age she is now, and she'll waste all the rest of her life trying to stay that age. Her whole idea is to race on to the silliest time of one's life as quick as she can and then stop there as long as she can.”

“Well, don't let's talk about that now,” said Peter. “Look! Here are lovely fruit-trees. Let us taste them.”

And then, for the first time, Tirian looked about him and realized how very queer this adventure was.





Chapter 13　HOW THE DWARFS REFUSED TO BE TAKEN IN


Tirian had thought—or he would have thought if he had time to think at all—that they were inside a little thatched stable, about twelve feet long and six feet wide. In reality they stood on grass, the deep blue sky was overhead, and the air which blew gently on their faces was that of a day in early summer.

Not far away from them rose a grove of trees, thickly leaved, but under every leaf there peeped out the gold or faint yellow or purple or glowing red of fruits such as no one has seen in our world. The fruit made Tirian feel that it must be autumn but there was something in the feel of the air that told him it could not be later than June. They all moved towards the trees.

Everyone raised his hand to pick the fruit he best liked the look of, and then everyone paused for a second. This fruit was so beautiful that each felt “It can't be meant for me…surely we're not allowed to pluck it.”

“It's all right,” said Peter. “I know what we're all thinking. But I'm sure, quite sure, we needn't. I've a feeling we've got to the country where everything is allowed.”

“Here goes, then!” said Eustace. And they all began to eat.

What was the fruit like? Unfortunately no one can describe a taste. All I can say is that, compared with those fruits, the freshest grapefruit you've ever eaten was dull, and the juiciest orange was dry, and the most melting pear was hard and woody, and the sweetest wild strawberry was sour. And there were no seeds or stones, and no wasps. If you had once eaten that fruit, all the nicest things in this world would taste like medicines after it. But I can't describe it. You can't find out what it is like unless you can get to that country and taste it for yourself.

When they had eaten enough, Eustace said to King Peter, “You haven't yet told us how you got here. You were just going to, when King Tirian turned up.”

“There's not much to tell,” said Peter. “Edmund and I were standing on the platform and we saw your train coming in. I remember thinking it was taking the bend far too fast. And I remember thinking how funny it was that our people were probably in the same train though Lucy didn't know about it—”

“Your people, High King?” said Tirian.

“I mean my Father and Mother—Edmund's and Lucy's and mine.”

“Why were they?” asked Jill. “You don't mean to say they know about Narnia?”

“Oh no, it had nothing to do with Narnia. They were on their way to Bristol. I'd only heard they were going that morning. But Edmund said they'd be bound to be going by that train.” (Edmund was the sort of person who knows about railways.)

“And what happened then?” said Jill.

“Well, it's not very easy to describe, is it, Edmund?” said the High King.

“Not very,” said Edmund. “It wasn't at all like that other time when we were pulled out of our own world by Magic. There was a frightful roar and something hit me with a bang, but it didn't hurt. And I felt not so much scared as—well, excited. Oh—and this is one queer thing. I'd had a rather sore knee, from a hack at rugger. I noticed it had suddenly gone. And I felt very light. And then—here we were.”

“It was much the same for us in the railway carriage,” said the Lord Digory, wiping the last traces of the fruit from his golden beard. “Only I think you and I, Polly, chiefly felt that we'd been unstiffened. You youngsters won't understand. But we stopped feeling old.”

“‘Youngsters,’ indeed!” said Jill. “I don't believe you two really are much older than we are here.”

“Well if we aren't, we have been,” said the Lady Polly.

“And what has been happening since you got here?” asked Eustace.

“Well,” said Peter, “for a long time (at least I suppose it was a long time) nothing happened. Then the door opened—”

“The door?” said Tirian.

“Yes,” said Peter. “The door you came in—or came out—by. Have you forgotten?”

“But where is it?”

“Look,” said Peter and pointed.

Tirian looked and saw the queerest and most ridiculous thing you can imagine. Only a few yards away, clear to be seen in the sunlight, there stood up a rough wooden door and, round it, the framework of the doorway: nothing else, no walls, no roof. He walked towards it, bewildered, and the others followed, watching to see what he would do. He walked round to the other side of the door. But it looked just the same from the other side: he was still in the open air, on a summer morning. The door was simply standing up by itself as if it had grown there like a tree.

“Fair Sir,” said Tirian to the High King, “this is a great marvel.”

“It is the door you came through with that Calormene five minutes ago,” said Peter smiling.

“But did I not come in out of the wood into the stable? Whereas this seems to be a door leading from nowhere to nowhere.”

“It looks like that if you walk round it,” said Peter. “But put your eye to that place where there is a crack between two of the planks and look through.”

Tirian put his eye to the hole. At first he could see nothing but blackness. Then, at his eyes grew used to it, he saw the dull red glow of a bonfire that was nearly going out, and above that, in a black sky, stars. Then he could see dark figures moving about or standing between him and the fire: he could hear them talking and their voices were like those of Calormenes. So he knew that he was looking out through the stable door into the darkness of Lantern Waste where he had fought his last battle. The men were discussing whether to go in and look for Rishda Tarkaan (but none of them wanted to do that) or to set fire to the stable.

He looked round again and could hardly believe his eyes. There was the blue sky overhead, and grassy country spreading as far as he could see in every direction, and his new friends all round him laughing.

“It seems, then,” said Tirian, smiling himself, “that the stable seen from within and the stable seen from without are two different places.”

“Yes,” said the Lord Digory. “Its inside is bigger than its outside.”

“Yes,” said Queen Lucy. “In our world too, a stable once had something inside it that was bigger than our whole world.”

It was the first time she had spoken, and from the thrill in her voice, Tirian now knew why. She was drinking everything in even more deeply than the others. She had been too happy to speak. He wanted to hear her speak again, so he said:

“Of your courtesy, Madam, tell on. Tell me your whole adventure.”

“After the shock and the noise,” said Lucy, “we found ourselves here. And we wondered at the door, as you did. Then the door opened for the first time (we saw darkness through the doorway when it did) and there came through a big man with a naked sword. We saw by his arms that he was a Calormene.

“He took his stand beside the door with his sword raised, resting on his shoulder, ready to cut down anyone who came through. We went to him and spoke to him, but we thought he could neither see nor hear us. And he never looked round on the sky and the sunlight and the grass: I think he couldn't see them either. So then we waited a long time. Then we heard the bolt being drawn on the other side of the door. But the man didn't get ready to strike with his sword till he could see who was coming in. So we supposed he had been told to strike some and spare others. But at the very moment when the door opened, all of a sudden Tash was there, on this side of the door; none of us saw where he came from. And through the door there came a big Cat. It gave one look at Tash and ran for its life: just in time, for he pounced at it and the door hit his beak as it was shut. The man could see Tash. He turned very pale and bowed down before the Monster: but it vanished away.

“Then we waited a long time again. At last the door opened for the third time and there came in a young Calormene. I liked him. The sentinel at the door started, and looked very surprised, when he saw him. I think he'd been expecting someone quite different—”

“I see it all now,” said Eustace (he had the bad habit of interrupting stories). “The Cat was to go in first and the sentry had orders to do him no harm. Then the Cat was to come out and say he'd seen their beastly Tashlan and pretend to be frightened so as to scare the other Animals. But what Shift never guessed was that the real Tash would turn up; so Ginger came out really frightened. And after that, Shift would send in anyone he wanted to get rid of and the sentry would kill them. And—”

“Friend,” said Tirian softly, “you hinder the lady in her tale.”

“Well,” said Lucy, “the sentry was surprised. That gave the other man just time to get on guard. They had a fight. He killed the sentry and flung him outside the door. Then he came walking slowly forward to where we were. He could see us, and everything else. We tried to talk to him but he was rather like a man in a trance. He kept on saying Tash, Tash, where is Tash? I go to Tash. So we gave it up and he went away somewhere—over there. I liked him. And after that…ugh!” Lucy made a face.

“After that,” said Edmund, “someone flung a monkey through the door. And Tash was there again. My sister is so tender-hearted she doesn't like to tell you that Tash made one peck and the Monkey was gone!”

“Serve him right!” said Eustace. “All the same, I hope he'll disagree with Tash too.”

“And after that,” said Edmund, “came about a dozen Dwarfs: and then Jill, and Eustace, and last of all yourself.”

“I hope Tash ate the Dwarfs too,” said Eustace. “Little swine.”

“No, he didn't,” said Lucy. “And don't be horrid. Thery're still here. In fact you can see them from here. And I've tried and tried to make friends with them but it's no use.”

“Friends with them!” cried Eustace. “If you knew how those Dwarfs have been behaving!”

“Oh stop it, Eustace,” said Lucy. “Do come and see them. King Tirian, perhaps you could do something with them.”

“I can feel no great love for Dwarfs today,” said Tirian. “Yet at your asking, Lady, I would do a greater thing than this.”

Lucy led the way and soon they could all see the Dwarfs. They had a very odd look. They weren't strolling about or enjoying themselves (although the cords with which they had been tied seemed to have vanished) nor were they lying down and having a rest. They were sitting very close together in a little circle facing one another. They never looked round or took any notice of the humans till Lucy and Tirian were almost near enough to touch them. Then the Dwarfs all cocked their heads as if they couldn't see anyone but were listening hard and trying to guess by the sound what was happening.

“Look out!” said one of them in a surly voice. “Mind where you're going. Don't walk into our faces!”

“All right!” said Eustace indignantly. “We're not blind. We've got eyes in our heads.”

“They must be darn good ones if you can see in here,” said the same Dwarf whose name was Diggle.

“In where?” asked Edmund.

“Why you bone-head, in here of course,” said Diggle. “In this pitch-black, poky, smelly little hole of a stable.”

“Are you blind?” said Tirian.

“Ain't we all blind in the dark!” said Diggle.

“But it isn't dark, you poor stupid Dwarfs,” said Lucy. “Can't you see? Look up! Look round! Can't you see the sky and the trees and the flowers? Can't you see me?”

“How in the name of all Humbug can I see what ain't there? And how can I see you any more than you can see me in this pitch darkness?”

“But I can see you,” said Lucy. “I'll prove I can see you. You've got a pipe in your mouth.”

“Anyone that knows the smell of baccy could tell that,” said Diggle.

“Oh the poor things! This is dreadful,” said Lucy. Then she had an idea. She stopped and picked some wild violets. “Listen, Dwarf,” she said. “Even if your eyes are wrong, perhaps your nose is all right: can you smell that?” She leaned across and held the fresh, damp flowers to Diggle's ugly nose. But she had to jump back quickly in order to avoid a blow from his hard little fist.

“None of that!” he shouted. “How dare you! What do you mean by shoving a lot of filthy stable-litter in my face? There was a thistle in it too. It's like your sauce! And who are you anyway?”

“Earth-man,” said Tirian, “she is the Queen Lucy, sent hither by Aslan out of the deep past. And it is for her sake alone that I, Tirian your lawful King, do not cut all your heads from your shoulders, proved and twice-proved traitors that you are.”

“Well if that doesn't beat everything!” exclaimed Diggle. “How can you go on talking all that rot? Your wonderful Lion didn't come and help you, did he? Thought not. And now—even now—when you've been beaten and shoved into this black hole, just the same as the rest of us, you're still at your old game. Starting a new lie! Trying to make us believe we're none of us shut up, and it ain't dark, and heaven knows what.”

“There is no black hole, save in your own fancy, fool,” cried Tirian. “Come out of it.” And, leaning forward, he caught Diggle by the belt and the hood and swung him right out of the circle of Dwarfs. But the moment Tirian put him down, Diggle darted back to his place among the others, rubbing his nose and howling:

“Ow! Ow! What d'you do that for! Banging my face against the wall. You've nearly broken my nose.”

“Oh dear!” said Lucy, “What are we to do for them?”

“Let 'em alone,” said Eustace: but as he spoke the earth trembled. The sweet air grew suddenly sweeter. A brightness flashed behind them. All turned. Tirian turned last because he was afraid. There stood his heart's desire, huge and real, the golden Lion, Aslan himself, and already the others were kneeling in a circle round his forepaws and burying their hands and faces in his mane as he stooped his great head to touch them with his tongue. Then he fixed his eyes upon Tirian, and Tirian came near, trembling, and flung himself at the Lion's feet, and the Lion kissed him and said, “Well done, last of the Kings of Narnia who stood firm at the darkest hour.”

“Aslan,” said Lucy through her tears, “could you—will you—do something for these poor Dwarfs?”

“Dearest,” said Aslan, “I will show you both what I can, and what I cannot, do.” He came close to the Dwarfs and gave a low growl: low, but it set all the air shaking. But the Dwarfs said to one another, “Hear that? That's the gang at the other end of the stable. Trying to frighten us. They do it with a machine of some kind. Don't take any notice. They won't take us in again!”

Aslan raised his head and shook his mane. Instantly a glorious feast appeared on the Dwarfs' knees: pies and tongues and pigeons and trifles and ices, and each Dwarf had a goblet of good wine in his right hand. But it wasn't much use. They began eating and drinking greedily enough, but it was clear that they couldn't taste it properly. They thought they were eating and drinking only the sort of things you might find in a stable. One said he was trying to eat hay and another said he had a bit of an old turnip and a third said he'd found a raw cabbage leaf. And they raised golden goblets of rich red wine to their lips and said “Ugh! Fancy drinking dirty water out of a trough that a donkey's been at! Never thought we'd come to this.”

But very soon every Dwarf began suspecting that every other Dwarf had found something nicer than he had, and they started grabbing and snatching, and went on to quarrelling, till in a few minutes there was a free fight and all the good food was smeared on their faces and clothes or trodden under foot.

But when at last they sat down to nurse their black eyes and their bleeding noses, they all said: “Well, at any rate there's no Humbug here. We haven't let anyone take us in. The Dwarfs are for the Dwarfs.”

“You see,” said Aslan. “They will not let us help them. They have chosen cunning instead of belief. Their prison is only in their own minds, yet they are in that prison; and so afraid of being taken in that they cannot be taken out. But come, children. I have other work to do.”

He went to the Door and they all followed him. He raised his head and roared, “Now it is time!” then louder, “Time!”; then so loud that it could have shaken the stars, “TIME.” The Door flew open.





Chapter 14　NIGHT FALLS ON NARNIA


They all stood beside Aslan, on his right side, and looked through the open doorway.

The bonfire had gone out. On the earth all was blackness: in fact you could not have told that you were looking into a wood if you had not seen where the dark shapes of the trees ended and the stars began. But when Aslan had roared yet again, out on their left they saw another black shape. That is, they saw another patch where there were no stars: and the patch rose up higher and higher and became the shape of a man, the hugest of all giants. They all knew Narnia well enough to work out where he must be standing. He must be on the high moorlands that stretch away to the North beyond the River Shribble.

Then Jill and Eustace remembered how once long ago, in the deep caves beneath those moors, they had seen a great giant asleep and been told that his name was Father Time, and that he would wake on the day the world ended.

“Yes,” said Aslan, though they had not spoken. “While he lay dreaming his name was Time. Now that he is awake he will have a new one.”

Then the great giant raised a horn to his mouth. They could see this by the change of the black shape he made against the stars. After that—quite a bit later, because sound travels so slowly—they heard the sound of the horn: high and terrible, yet of a strange, deadly beauty.

Immediately the sky became full of shooting stars. Even one shooting star is a fine thing to see; but these were dozens, and then scores, and then hundreds, till it was like silver rain: and it went on and on. And when it had gone on for some while, one or two of them began to think that there was another dark shape against the sky as well as the giant's. It was in a different place, right overhead, up in the very roof of the sky as you might call it. “Perhaps it is a cloud,” thought Edmund. At any rate, there were no stars there: just blackness. But all around, the downpour of stars went on. And then the starless patch began to grow, spreading further and further out from the centre of the sky. And presently a quarter of the whole sky was black, and then a half, and at last the rain of shooting stars was going on only low down near the horizon.

With a thrill of wonder (and there was some terror in it too) they all suddenly realized what was happening. The spreading blackness was not a cloud at all: it was simply emptiness. The black part of the sky was the part in which there were no stars left. All the stars were falling: Aslan had called them home.

The last few seconds before the rain of stars had quite ended were very exciting. Stars began falling all round them. But stars in that world are not the great flaming globes they are in ours. They are people (Edmund and Lucy had once met one). So now they found showers of glittering people, all with long hair like burning silver and spears like white-hot metal, rushing down to them out of the black air, swifter than falling stones. They made a hissing noise as they landed and burnt the grass. And all these stars glided past them and stood somewhere behind, a little to the right.

This was a great advantage, because otherwise, now that there were no stars in the sky, everything would have been completely dark and you could have seen nothing. As it was, the crowd of stars behind them cast a fierce, white light over their shoulders. They could see mile upon mile of Narnian woods spread out before them, looking as if they were floodlit. Every bush and almost every blade of grass had its black shadow behind it. The edge of every leaf stood out so sharp that you'd think you could cut your finger on it.

On the grass before them lay their own shadows. But the great thing was Aslan's shadow. It streamed away to their left, enormous and very terrible. And all this was under a sky that would now be starless forever.

The light from behind them (and a little to their right) was so strong that it lit up even the slopes of the Northern Moors. Something was moving there. Enormous animals were crawling and sliding down into Narnia: great dragons and giant lizards and featherless birds with wings like bats' wings. They disappeared into the woods and for a few minutes there was silence.

Then there came—at first from very far off—sounds of wailing and then, from every direction, a rustling and a pattering and a sound of wings. It came nearer and nearer. Soon one could distinguish the scamper of little feet from the padding of big paws, and the clack-clack of light little hoofs from the thunder of great ones. And then one could see thousands of pairs of eyes gleaming. And at last, out of the shadow of the trees, racing up the hill for dear life, by thousands and by millions, came all kinds of creatures—Talking Beasts, Dwarfs, Satyrs, Fauns, Giants, Calormenes, men from Archenland, Monopods, and strange unearthly things from the remote islands of the unknown Western lands. And all these ran up to the doorway where Aslan stood.

This part of the adventure was the only one which seemed rather like a dream at the time and rather hard to remember properly afterwards. Especially, one couldn't say how long it had taken. Sometimes it seemed to have lasted only a few minutes, but at others it felt as if it might have gone on for years. Obviously, unless either the Door had grown very much larger or the creatures had suddenly grown as small as gnats, a crowd like that couldn't ever have tried to get through it. But no one thought about that sort of thing at the time.

The creatures came rushing on, their eyes brighter and brighter as they drew nearer and nearer to the standing Stars. But as they came right up to Aslan one or other of two things happened to each of them. They all looked straight in his face, I don't think they had any choice about that. And when some looked, the expression of their faces changed terribly—it was fear and hatred: except that, on the faces of Talking Bears, the fear and hatred lasted only for a fraction of a second. You could see that they suddenly ceased to the Talking Beasts. They were just ordinary animals. And all the creatures who looked at Aslan in that way swerved to their right, his left, and disappeared into his huge black shadow, which (as you have heard) streamed away to the left of the doorway. The children never saw them again. I don't know what became of them.

But the others looked in the face of Aslan and loved him, though some of them were very frightened at the same time. And all these came in at the Door, in on Aslan's right. There were some queer specimens among them. Eustace even recognized one of those very Dwarfs who had helped to shoot the Horses. But he had no time to wonder about that sort of thing (and anyway it was no business of his) for a great joy put everything else out of his head. Among the happy creatures who now came crowding round Tirian and his friends were all those whom they had thought dead. There was Roonwit the Centaur and Jewel the Unicorn and the good Boar and the good Bear, and Farsight the Eagle, and the dear Dogs and the Horses, and Poggin the Dwarf.

“Further in and higher up!” cried Roonwit and thundered away in a gallop to the West. And though they did not understand him, the words somehow set them tingling all over. The Boar grunted at them cheerfully. The Bear was just going to mutter that he still didn't understand, when he caught sight of the fruit-trees behind them. He waddled to those trees as fast as he could and there, no doubt, found something he understood very well. But the Dogs remained, wagging their tails, and Poggin remained, shaking hands with everyone and grinning all over his honest face. And Jewel leaned his snowy white head over the King's shoulder and the King whispered in Jewel's ear. Then everyone turned his attention again to what could be seen through the Doorway.

The Dragons and Giant Lizards now had Narnia to themselves. They went to and fro tearing up the trees by the roots and crunching them up as if they were sticks of rhubarb. Minute by minute the forests disappeared. The whole country became bare and you could see all sorts of things about its shape—all the little humps and hollows which you had never noticed before. The grass died. Soon Tirian found that he was looking at a world of bare rock and earth. You could hardly believe that anything had ever lived there. The monsters themselves grew old and lay down and died. Their flesh shrivelled up and the bones appeared: soon they were only huge skeletons that lay here and there on the dead rock, looking as if they had died thousands of years ago. For a long time everything was still.

At last something white—a long, level line of whiteness that gleamed in the light of the standing stars—came moving towards them from the Eastern end of the world. A widespread noise broke the silence: first a murmur then a rumble, then a roar. And now they could see what it was that was coming, and how fast it came. It was a foaming wall of water. The sea was rising. In that tree-less world you could see it very well. You could see all the rivers getting wider and the lakes getting larger, and separate lakes joining into one, and valleys turning into new lakes, and hills turning into islands, and then those islands vanishing. And the high moors to their left and the higher mountains to their right crumbled and slipped down with a roar and a splash into the mounting water; and the water came swirling up to the very threshold of the Doorway (but never passed it) so that the foam splashed about Aslan's forefeet. All now was level water from where they stood to where the waters met the sky.

And out there it began to grow light. A streak of dreary and disastrous dawn spread along the horizon, and widened and grew brighter, till in the end they hardly noticed the light of the stars who stood behind them. At last the sun came up. When it did, the Lord Digory and the Lady Polly looked at one another and gave a little nod: those two, in a different world, had once seen a dying sun, and so they knew at once that this sun also was dying. It was three times—twenty times—as big as it ought to be, and very dark red. As its rays fell upon the great Time-giant, he turned red too: and in the reflection of that sun the whole waste of shoreless waters looked like blood.

Then the Moon came up, quite in her wrong position, very close to the sun, and she also looked red. And at the sight of her the sun began shooting out great flames, like whiskers or snakes of crimson fire, towards her. It is as if he were an octopus trying to draw her to himself in his tentacles. And perhaps he did draw her. At any rate she came to him, slowly at first, but then more and more quickly, till at last his long flames licked round her and the two ran together and became one huge ball like a burning coal. Great lumps of fire came dropping out of it into the sea and clouds of steam rose up.

Then Aslan said, “Now make an end.”

The giant threw his horn into the sea. Then he stretched out one arm—very black it looked, and thousands of miles long—across the sky till his hand reached the Sun. He took the Sun and squeezed it in his hand as you would squeeze an orange. And instantly there was total darkness.

Everyone except Aslan jumped back from the ice-cold air which now blew through the Doorway. Its edges were already covered with icicles.

“Peter, High King of Narnia,” said Aslan. “Shut the Door.”

Peter, shivering with cold, leaned out into the darkness and pulled the Door to. It scraped over ice as he pulled it. Then, rather clumsily (for even in that moment his hands had gone numb and blue) he took out a golden key and locked it.

They had seen strange things enough through that Doorway. But it was stranger than any of them to look round and find themselves in warm daylight, the blue sky above them, flowers at their feet, and laughter in Aslan's eyes.

He turned swiftly round, crouched lower, lashed himself with his tail and shot away like a golden arrow.

“Come further in! Come further up!” he shouted over his shoulder. But who could keep up with him at that pace? They set out walking Westward to follow him.

“So,” said Peter, “night falls on Narnia. What, Lucy! You're not crying? With Aslan ahead, and all of us here?”

“Don't try to stop me, Peter,” said Lucy, “I am sure Aslan would not. I am sure it is not wrong to mourn for Narnia. Think of all that lies dead and frozen behind that door.”

“Yes and I did hope,” said Jill, “that it might go on for ever. I knew our world couldn't. I did think Narnia might.”

“I saw it begin,” said the Lord Digory. “I did not think I would live to see it die.”

“Sirs,” said Tirian. “The ladies do well to weep. See, I do so myself. I have seen my mother's death. What world but Narnia have I ever known? It were no virtue, but great discourtesy, if we did not mourn.”

They walked away from the Door and away from the Dwarfs who still sat crowded together in their imaginary stable. And as they went they talked to one another about old wars and old peace and ancient Kings and all the glories of Narnia.

The Dogs were still with them. They joined in the conversation but not much because they were too busy racing on ahead and racing back and rushing off to sniff at smells in the grass till they made themselves sneeze. Suddenly they picked up a scent which seemed to excite them very much. They all started arguing about it—“Yes it is—No it isn't—That's just what I said—anyone can smell what that is—Take your great nose out of the way and let someone else smell.”

“What is it, cousins?” said Peter.

“A Calormene, Sire,” said several Dogs at once.

“Lead on to him, then,” said Peter. “Whether he meets us in peace or war, he shall be welcome.”

The Dogs darted on ahead and came back a moment later, running as if their lives depended on it, and barking loudly to say that it really was a Calormene. (Talking Dogs, just like the common ones, behave as if they thought whatever they are doing at the moment immensely important.)

The others followed where the Dogs led them and found a young Calormene sitting under a chestnut tree beside a clear stream of water. It was Emeth. He rose at once and bowed gravely.

“Sir,” he said to Peter, “I know not whether you are my friend or my foe, but I should count it my honour to have you for either. Has not one of the poets said that a noble friend is the best gift and a noble enemy the next best?”

“Sir,” said Peter, “I do not know that there need be any war between you and us.”

“Do tell us who you are and what's happened to you,” said Jill.

“If there's going to be a story, let's all have a drink and sit down,” barked the Dogs. “We're quite blown.”

“Well of course you will be if you keep tearing about the way you have done,” said Eustace.

So the humans sat down on the grass. And when the Dogs had all had a very noisy drink out of the stream they all sat down, bolt upright, panting, with their tongues hanging out of their heads a little on one side to hear the story. But Jewel remained standing, polishing his horn against his side.





Chapter 15　FURTHER UP AND FURTHER IN


“Know, O Warlike Kings,” said Emeth, “and you, O ladies whose beauty illuminates the universe, that I am Emeth the seventh son of Harpha Tarkaan of the city of Tehishbaan, Westward beyond the desert. I came lately into Narnia with nine and twenty others under the command of Rishda Tarkaan Now when I first heard that we should march upon Narnia I rejoiced; for I had heard many things of your Land and desired greatly to meet you in battle. But when I found that we were to go in disguised as merchants (which is a shameful dress for a warrior and the son of a Tarkaan) and to work by lies and trickery, then my joy departed from me. And most of all when I found we must wait upon a Monkey, and when it began to be said that Tash and Aslan were one, then the world became dark in my eyes. For always since I was a boy I have served Tash and my great desire was to know more of him, if it might be, to look upon his face. But the name of Aslan was hateful to me.

“And, as you have seen, we were called together outside the straw-roofed hovel, night after night, and the fire was kindled, and the Ape brought forth out of the hovel something upon four legs that I could not well see. And the people and the Beasts bowed down and did honour to it. But I thought, the Tarkaan is deceived by the Ape: for this thing that comes out of the stable is neither Tash nor any other god. But when I watched the Tarkaan's face, and marked every word that he said to the Monkey, then I changed my mind: for I saw that the Tarkaan did not believe in it himself. And then I understood that he did not believe in Tash at all: for if he had, how could he dare to mock him?

“When I understood this, a great rage fell upon me and I wondered that the true Tash did not strike down both the Monkey and the Tarkaan with fire from heaven. Nevertheless I hid my anger and held my tongue and waited to see how it would end. But last night, as some of you know, the Monkey brought not forth the yellow thing but said that all who desired to look upon Tashlan—for so they mixed the two words to pretend that they were all one—must pass one by one into the hovel. And I said to myself, Doubtless this is some other deception. But when the Cat had followed in and had come out again in a madness of terror, then I said to myself, Surely the true Tash, whom they called on without knowledge or belief, has now come among us, and will avenge himself. And though my heart was turned into water inside me because of the greatness and terror of Tash, yet my desire was stronger than my fear, and I put force upon my knees to stay them from trembling, and on my teeth that they should not chatter, and resolved to look upon the face of Tash though he should slay me. So I offered myself to go into the hovel; and the Tarkaan, though unwillingly, let me go.

“As soon as I had gone in at the door, the first wonder was that I found myself in this great sunlight (as we all are now) though the inside of the hovel had looked dark from outside. But I had no time to marvel at this, for immediately I was forced to fight for my head against one of our own men. As soon as I saw him I understood that the Monkey and the Tarkaan had set him there to slay any who came in if he were not in their secrets: so that this man also was a liar and a mocker and no true servant of Tash. I had the better will to fight him; and having slain the villain, I cast him out behind me through the door.

“Then I looked about me and saw the sky and the wide lands, and smelled the sweetness. And I said, By the Gods, this is a pleasant place: it may be that I am come into the country of Tash. And I began to journey into the strange country and to seek him.

“So I went over much grass and many flowers and among all kinds of wholesome and delectable trees till lo! in a narrow place between two rocks there came to meet me a great Lion. The speed of him was like the ostrich, and his size was an elephant's; his hair was like pure gold and the brightness of his eyes like gold that is liquid in the furnace. He was more terrible than the Flaming Mountain of Lagour, and in beauty he surpassed all that is in the world even as the rose in bloom surpasses the dust of the desert.

“Then I fell at his feet and thought, Surely this is the hour of death, for the Lion (who is worthy of all honour) will know that I have served Tash all my days and not him. Nevertheless, it is better to see the Lion and die than to be Tisroc of the world and live and not to have seen him. But the Glorious One bent down his golden head and touched my forehead with his tongue and said, Son, thou art welcome. But I said, Alas, Lord, I am no son of thine but the servant of Tash. He answered, Child, all the service thou hast done to Tash, I account as service done to me. Then by reasons of my great desire for wisdom and understanding, I overcame my fear and questioned the Glorious One and said, Lord, is it then true, as the Ape said, that thou and Tash are one? The Lion growled so that the earth shook (but his wrath was not against me) and said, It is false. Not because he and I are one, but because we are opposites, I take to me the services which thou hast done to him. For I and he are of such different kinds that no service which is vile can be done to me, and none which is not vile can be done to him. Therefore if any man swear by Tash and keep his oath for the oath's sake, it is by me that he has truly sworn, though he know it not, and it is I who reward him. And if any man do a cruelty in my name, then, though he says the name Aslan, it is Tash whom he serves and by Tash his deed is accepted. Dost thou understand, Child? I said, Lord, thou knowest how much I understand. But I said also (for the truth constrained me), Yet I have been seeking Tash all my days. Beloved, said the Glorious One, unless thy desire had been for me thou wouldst not have sought so long and so truly. For all find what they truly seek.

“Then he breathed upon me and took away the trembling from my limbs and caused me to stand upon my feet. And after that, he said not much, but that we should meet again, and I must go further up and further in. Then he turned him about in a storm and flurry of gold and was gone suddenly.

“And since then, O Kings and Ladies, I have been wandering to find him and my happiness is so great that it even weakens me like a wound. And this is the marvel of marvels, that he called me Beloved, me who am but as a dog—”

“Eh? What's that?” said one of the Dogs.

“Sir,” said Emeth. “It is but a fashion of speech which we have in Calormen.”

“Well, I can't say it's one I like very much,” said the Dog.

“He doesn't mean any harm,” said an older Dog. “After all, we call our puppies Boys when they don't behave properly.”

“So we do,” said the first Dog. “Or girls.”

“S-s-sh!” said the Old Dog. “That's not a nice word to use. Remember where you are.”

“Look!” said Jill suddenly. Someone was coming, rather timidly, to meet them; a graceful creature on four feet, all silvery-grey. And they stared at him for a whole ten seconds before five or six voices said all at once, “Why, it's old Puzzle!” They had never seen him by daylight with the lion-skin off, and it made an extraordinary difference. He was himself now: a beautiful donkey with such a soft, grey coat and such a gentle, honest face that if you had seen him you would have done just what Jill and Lucy did—rushed forward and put your arms round his neck and kissed his nose and stroked his ears.

When they asked him where he had been he said he had come in at the door along with all the other creatures but he had—well, to tell the truth, he had been keeping out of their way as much as he could; and out of Aslan's way. For the sight of the real Lion had made him so ashamed of all that nonsense about dressing up in a lion-skin that he did not know how to look anyone in the face. But when he saw that all his friends were going away Westward, and after he had had a mouthful of grass (“And I've never tasted such good grass in my life,” said Puzzle), he plucked up his courage and followed. “But what I'll do if I really have to meet Aslan, I'm sure I don't know,” he added.

“You'll find it will be all right when you really do,” said Queen Lucy.

Then they went forward together, always Westward, for that seemed to be the direction Aslan had meant when he cried out, “Further up and futher in.” Many other creatures were slowly moving the same way, but that grassy country was very wide and there was no crowding.

It still seemed to be early, and the morning freshness was in the air. They kept on stopping to look round and to look behind them, partly because it was so beautiful but partly also because there was something about it which they could not understand.

“Peter,” said Lucy, “where is this, do you suppose?”

“I don't know,” said the High King. “It reminds me of somewhere but I can't give it a name. Could it be somewhere we once stayed for a holiday when we were very, very small?”

“It would have to have been a jolly good holiday,” said Eustace. “I bet there isn't a country like this anywhere in our world. Look at the colours! You couldn't get a blue like the blue on those mountains in our world.”

“Is it not Aslan's country?” said Tirian.

“Not like Aslan's country on top of that mountain beyond the Eastern end of the world,” said Jill. “I've been there.”

“If you ask me,” said Edmund, “it's like somewhere in the Narnian world. Look at those mountains ahead—and the big ice—mountains beyond them. Surely they're rather like the mountains we used to see from Narnia, the ones up Westward beyond the Waterfall?”

“Yes, so they are,” said Peter. “Only these are bigger.”

“I don't think those ones are so very like anything in Narnia,” said Lucy. “But look there.” She pointed Southward to their left, and everyone stopped and turned to look. “Those hills,” said Lucy, “the nice woody ones and the blue ones behind—aren't they very like the Southern border of Narnia?”

“Like!” cried Edmund after a moment's silence. “Why, they're exactly like. Look, there's Mount Pire with his forked head, and there's the pass into Archenland and everything!”

“And yet they're not like,” said Lucy. “They're different. They have more colours on them and they look further away than I remembered and they're more .. . more…oh, I don't know…”

“More like the real thing,” said the Lord Digory softly.

Suddenly Farsight the Eagle spread his wings, soared thirty or forty feet up into the air, circled round and then alighted on the ground.

“Kings and Queens,” he cried, “we have all been blind. We are only beginning to see where we are. From up there I have seen it all—Ettinsmuir, Beaversdam, the Great River, and Cair Paravel still shining on the edge of the Eastern Sea. Narnia is not dead. This is Narnia.”

“But how can it be?” said Peter. “For Aslan told us older ones that we should never return to Narnia, and here we are.”

“Yes,” said Eustace. “And we saw it all destroyed and the sun put out.”

“And it's all so different,” said Lucy.

“The Eagle is right,” said the Lord Digory. “Listen, Peter. When Aslan said you could never go back to Narnia, he meant the Narnia you were thinking of. But that was not the real Narnia. That had a beginning and an end. It was only a shadow or a copy of the real Narnia which has always been here and always will be here: just as our world, England and all, is only a shadow or copy of something in Aslan's real world. You need not mourn over Narnia, Lucy. All of the old Narnia that mattered, all the dear creatures, have been drawn into the real Narnia through the Door. And of course it is different; as different as a real thing is from a shadow or as waking life is from a dream.”

His voice stirred everyone like a trumpet as he spoke these words: but when he added under his breath “It's all in Plato, all in Plato: bless me, what do they teach them at these schools!” the older ones laughed. It was so exactly like the sort of thing they had heard him say long ago in that other world where his beard was grey instead of golden. He knew why they were laughing and joined in the laugh himself. But very quickly they all became grave again: for, as you know, there is a kind of happiness and wonder that makes you serious. It is too good to waste on jokes.

It is as hard to explain how this sunlit land was different from the old Narnia as it would be to tell you how the fruits of that country taste. Perhaps you will get some idea of it if you think like this. You may have been in a room in which there was a window that looked out on a lovely bay of the sea or a green valley that wound away among mountains. And in the wall of that room opposite to the window there may have been a lookingglass. And as you turned away from the window you suddenly caught sight of that sea or that valley, all over again, in the looking glass. And the sea in the mirror, or the valley in the mirror, were in one sense just the same as the real ones: yet at the same time they were somehow different—deeper, more wonderful, more like places in a story: in a story you have never heard but very much want to know.

The difference between the old Narnia and the new Narnia was like that. The new one was a deeper country: every rock and flower and blade of grass looked as if it meant more. I can't describe it any better than that: if ever you get there you will know what I mean.

It was the Unicorn who summed up what everyone was feeling. He stamped his right fore-hoof on the ground and neighed, and then cried:

“I have come home at last! This is my real country! I belong here. This is the land I have been looking for all my life, though I never knew it till now. The reason why we loved the old Narnia is that it sometimes looked a little like this. Bree-hee-hee! Come further up, come further in!”

He shook his mane and sprang forward into a great gallop—a Unicorn's gallop, which, in our world, would have carried him out of sight in a few moments. But now a most strange thing happened. Everyone else began to run, and they found, to their astonishment, that they could keep up with him: not only the Dogs and the humans but even fat little Puzzle and short-legged Poggin the Dwarf. The air flew in their faces as if they were driving fast in a car without a windscreen. The country flew past as if they were seeing it from the windows of an express train. Faster and faster they raced, but no one got hot or tired or out of breath.





Chapter 16　FAREWELL TO SHADOWLANDS


If one could run without getting tired, I don't think one would often want to do anything else. But there might be special reasons for stopping, and it was a special reason which made Eustace presently shout:

“I say! Steady! Look what we're coming to!”

And well he might. For now they saw before them Caldron Pool and beyond the Pool the high unclimbable cliffs and, pouring down the cliffs, thousands of tons of water every second, flashing like diamonds in some places and dark, glassy green in others, the Great Waterfall; and already the thunder of it was in their ears.

“Don't stop! Further up and further in,” called Farsight, tilting his flight a little upwards.

“It's all very well for him,” said Eustace, but Jewel also cried out:

“Don't stop. Further up and further in! Take it in your stride.”

His voice could only just be heard above the roar of the water but next moment everyone saw that he had plunged into the Pool. And helter-skelter behind him, with splash after splash, all the others did the same. The water was not biting cold as all of them (and especially Puzzle) expected, but of a delicious foamy coolness. They all found they were swimming straight for the Waterfall itself.

“This is absolutely crazy,” said Eustace to Edmund.

“I know. And yet—” said Edmund.

“Isn't it wonderful?” said Lucy. “Have you noticed one can't feel afraid, even if one wants to? Try it.”

“By Jove, neither one can,” said Eustace after he had tried.

Jewel reached the foot of the Waterfall first, but Tirian was only just behind him. Jill was last, so she could see the whole thing better than the others. She saw something white moving steadily up the face of the Waterfall. That white thing was the Unicorn. You couldn't tell whether he was swimming or climbing, but he moved on, higher and higher. The point of his horn divided the water just above his head, and it cascaded out in two rainbow-coloured streams all round his shoulders. Just behind him came King Tirian. He moved his legs and arms as if he were swimming but he moved straight upwards: as if one could swim up the wall of a house.

What looked funniest was the Dogs. During the gallop they had not been at all out of breath, but now, as they swarmed and wriggled upwards, there was plenty of spluttering and sneezing among them; that was because they would keep on barking, and every time they barked they got their mouths and noses full of water. But before Jill had time to notice all these things fully, she was going up the Waterfall herself. It was the sort of thing that would have been quite impossible in our world. Even if you hadn't been drowned, you would have been smashed to pieces by the terrible weight of water against the countless jags of rock. But in that world you could do it. You went on, up and up, with all kinds of reflected lights flashing at you from the water and all manner of coloured stones flashing through it, till it seemed as if you were climbing up light itself—and always higher and higher till the sense of height would have terrified you if you could be terrified, but later it was only gloriously exciting. And then at last one came to the lovely, smooth green curve in which the water poured over the top and found that one was out on the level river above the Waterfall. The current was racing away behind you, but you were such a wonderful swimmer that you could make headway against it. Soon they were all on the bank, dripping buthappy.

A long valley opened ahead and great snow-mountains, now much nearer, stood up against the sky.

“Further up and further in,” cried Jewel and instantly they were off again.

They were out of Narnia now and up into the Western Wild which neither Tirian nor Peter nor even the Eagle had ever seen before. But the Lord Digory and the Lady Polly had. “Do you remember? Do you remember?” they said—and said it in steady voices too, without panting, though the whole party was now running faster than an arrow flies.

“What, Lord?” said Tirian. “Is it then true, as stories tell, that you two journeyed here on the very day the world was made?”

“Yes,” said Digory, “and it seems to me as if it were only yesterday.”

“And on a flying horse?” asked Tirian. “Is that part true?”

“Certainly,” said Digory.

But the Dogs barked, “Faster, faster!”

So they ran faster and faster till it was more like flying than running, and even the Eagle overhead was going no faster than they. And they went through winding valley after winding valley and up the steep sides of hills and, faster than ever, down the other side, following the river and sometimes crossing it and skimming across mountainlakes as if they were living speed-boats, till at last at the far end of one long lake which looked as blue as a turquoise, they saw a smooth green hill. Its sides were as steep as the sides of a pyramid and round the very top of it ran a green wall: but above the wall rose the branches of trees whose leaves looked like silver and their fruit like gold.

“Further up and further in!” roared the Unicorn, and no one held back. They charged straight at the foot of the hill and then found themselves running up it almost as water from a broken wave runs up a rock out at the point of some bay. Though the slope was nearly as steep as the roof of a house and the grass was smooth as a bowling green, no one slipped.

Only when they had reached the very top did they slow up; that was because they found themselves facing great golden gates. And for a moment none of them was bold enough to try if the gates would open. They all felt just as they had felt about the fruit—“Dare we? Is it right? Can it be meant for us?”

But while they were standing thus a great horn, wonderfully loud and sweet, blew from somewhere inside that walled garden and the gates swung open.

Tirian stood holding his breath and wondering who would come out. And what came was the last thing he had expected: a little, sleek, bright-eyed Talking Mouse with a red feather stuck in a circlet on its head and its left paw resting on a long sword.

It bowed, a most beautiful bow, and said in its shrill voice:

“Welcome, in the Lion's name. Come further up and further in.”

Then Tirian saw King Peter and King Edmund and Queen Lucy rush forward to kneel down and greet the Mouse and they all cried out “Reepicheep!” And Tirian breathed fast with the sheer wonder of it, for now he knew that he was looking at one of the great heroes of Narnia, Reepicheep the Mouse who had fought at the great Battle of Beruna and afterwards sailed to the World's end with King Caspian the Seafarer. But before he had had much time to think of this he felt two strong arms thrown about him and felt a bearded kiss on his cheeks and heard a well remembered voice saying:

“What, lad? Art thicker and taller since I last touched thee!”

It was his own father, the good King Erlian: but not as Tirian had seen him last when they brought him home pale and wounded from his fight with the giant, nor even as Tirian remembered him in his later years when he was a grey-headed warrior. This was his father, young and merry, as he could just remember him from very early days when he himself had been a little boy playing games with his father in the castle garden at Cair Paravel, just before bedtime on summer evenings. The very smell of the bread-and-milk he used to have for supper came back to him.

Jewel thought to himself, “I will leave them to talk for a little and then I will go and greet the good King Erlian. Many a bright apple has he given me when I was but a colt.” But next moment he had something else to think of, for out of the gateway there came a horse so mighty and noble that even a Unicorn might feel shy in its presence: a great winged horse. It looked a moment at the Lord Digory and the Lady Polly and neighed out “What, cousins!” and they both shouted “Fledge! Good old Fledge!” and rushed to kiss it.

But by now the Mouse was again urging them to come in. So all of them passed in through the golden gates, into the delicious smell that blew towards them out of that garden and into the cool mixture of sunlight and shadow under the trees, walking on springy turf that was all dotted with white flowers. The very first thing which struck everyone was that the place was far larger than it had seemed from outside. But no one had time to think about that for people were coming up to meet the newcomers from every direction.

Everyone you had ever heard of (if you knew the history of these countries) seemed to be there. There was Glimfeather the Owl and Puddleglum the Marshwiggle, and King Rilian the Disenchanted, and his mother the Star's daughter and his great father Caspian himself. And close beside him were the Lord Drinian and the Lord Berne and Trumpkin the Dwarf and Truffle-hunter the good Badger with Glenstorm the Centaur and a hundred other heroes of the great War of Deliverance. And then from another side came Cor the King of Archenland with King Lune his father and his wife Queen Aravis and the brave prince Corin Thunder-Fist, his brother, and Bree the Horse and Hwin the Mare. And then—which was a wonder beyond all wonders to Tirian—there came from further away in the past, the two good Beavers and Tumnus the Faun. And there was greeting and kissing and hand-shaking and old jokes revived, (you've no idea how good an old joke sounds when you take it out again after a rest of five or six hundred years) and the whole company moved forward to the centre of the orchard where the Phoenix sat in a tree and looked down upon them all, and at the foot of that tree were two thrones and in those two thrones a King and Queen so great and beautiful that everyone bowed down before them. And well they might, for these two were King Frank and Queen Helen from whom all the most ancient Kings of Narnia and Archenland are descended. And Tirian felt as you would feel if you were brought before Adam and Eve in all their glory.

About half an hour later—or it might have been half a hundred years later, for time there is not like time here—Lucy stood with her dear friend, her oldest Narnian friend, the Faun Tumnus, looking down over the wall of that garden, and seeing all Narnia spread out below. But when you looked down you found that this hill was much higher than you had thought: it sank down with shining cliffs, thousands of feet below them and trees in that lower world looked no bigger than grains of green salt. Then she turned inward again and stood with her back to the wall and looked at the garden.

“I see,” she said at last, thoughtfully. “I see now. This garden is like the stable. It is far bigger inside than it was outside.”

“Of course, Daughter of Eve,” said the Faun. “The further up and the further in you go, the bigger everything gets. The inside is larger than the outside.”

Lucy looked hard at the garden and saw that it was not really a garden but a whole world, with its own rivers and woods and sea and mountains. But they were not strange: she knew them all.

“I see,” she said. “This is still Narnia, and more real and more beautiful then the Narnia down below, just as it was more real and more beautiful than the Narnia outside the stable door! I see… world within world, Narnia within Narnia…”

“Yes,” said Mr Tumnus, “like an onion: except that as you go in and in, each circle is larger than the last.”

And Lucy looked this way and that and soon found that a new and beautiful thing had happened to her. Whatever she looked at, however far away it might be, once she had fixed her eyes steadily on it, became quite clear and close as if she were looking through a telescope. She could see the whole Southern desert and beyond it the great city of Tashbaan: to Eastward she could see Cair Paravel on the edge of the sea and the very window of the room that had once been her own.

And far out to sea she could discover the islands, islands after islands to the end of the world, and, beyond the end, the huge mountain which they had called Aslan's country. But now she saw that it was part of a great chain of mountains which ringed round the whole world. In front of her it seemed to come quite close.

Then she looked to her left and saw what she took to be a great bank of brightly-coloured cloud, cut off from them by a gap. But she looked harder and saw that it was not a cloud at all but a real land. And when she had fixed her eyes on one particular spot of it, she at once cried out, “Peter! Edmund! Come and look! Come quickly.” And they came and looked, for their eyes also had become like hers.

“Why!” exclaimed Peter. “It's England. And that's the house itself—Professor Kirk's old home in the country where all our adventures began!”

“I thought that house had been destroyed,” said Edmund.

“So it was,” said the Faun. “But you are now looking at the England within England, the real England just as this is the real Narnia. And in that inner England no good thing is destroyed.”

Suddenly they shifted their eyes to another spot, and then Peter and Edmund and Lucy gasped with amazement and shouted out and began waving: for there they saw their own father and mother, waving back at them across the great, deep valley. It was like when you see people waving at you from the deck of a big ship when you are waiting on the quay to meet them.

“How can we get at them?” said Lucy.

“That is easy,” said Mr Tumnus. “That country and this country—all the real countries—are only spurs jutting out from the great mountains of Aslan. We have only to walk along the ridge, upward and inward, till it joins on. And listen! There is King Frank's horn: we must all go up.”

And soon they found themselves all walking together and a great, bright procession it was—up towards mountains higher than you could see in this world even if they were there to be seen. But there was no snow on those mountains: there were forests and green slopes and sweet orchards and flashing waterfalls, one above the other, going up forever. And the land they were walking on grew narrower all the time, with a deep valley on each side: and across that valley the land which was the real England grew nearer and nearer.

The light ahead was growing stronger. Lucy saw that a great series of many-coloured cliffs led up in front of them like a giant's staircase. And then she forgot everything else, because Aslan himself was coming, leaping down from cliff to cliff like a living cataract of power and beauty.

And the very first person whom Aslan called to him was Puzzle the Donkey. You never saw a donkey look feebler and sillier than Puzzle did as he walked up to Aslan, and he looked, beside Aslan, as small as a kitten looks beside a St Bernard. The Lion bowed down his head and whispered something to Puzzle at which his long ears went down, but then he said something else at which the ears perked up again. The humans couldn't hear what he had said either time.

Then Aslan turned to them and said: “You do not yet look so happy as I mean you to be.”

Lucy said, “We're so afraid of being sent away, Aslan. And you have sent us back into our own world so often.”

“No fear of that,” said Aslan. “Have you not guessed?”

Their hearts leaped and a wild hope rose within them.

“There was a real railway accident,” said Aslan softly. “Your father and mother and all of you are—as you used to call it in the Shadowlands—dead. The term is over: the holidays have begun. The dream is ended: this is the morning.”

And as He spoke He no longer looked to them like a lion; but the things that began to happen after that were so great and beautiful that I cannot write them. And for us this is the end of all the stories, and we can most truly say that they all lived happily ever after. But for them it was only the beginning of the real story. All their life in this world and all their adventures in Narnia had only been the cover and the title page: now at last they were beginning Chapter One of the Great Story which no one on earth has read: which goes on forever: in which every chapter is better than the one before.
