献给苏雷什·钱德拉·巴纳吉先生


亲爱的苏雷什：

因为《彩虹鸽》需要一位保护人，所以出于几个原因，我就想到了你。首先，作为诗人、自然观察家和旅行家，你能使这本书不受指责。事实上，没有一个人能像你本人做得这样好。

你了解彩虹鸽生长的这个国家，通晓鸟类知识。对一只鸽子来说，生命是两种事件的重复：寻找食物和躲避敌人攻击。要是目前这本书的主角重复做了逃避鹰的攻击这种事情，那是因为就鸽子的情况来说，这是一种长期存在的灾祸。

目前至于我的资料来源，你完全清楚，在这里不胜枚举。许多猎手、像你这样的诗人，以及用许多不同语言写成的书，都曾经帮助我写作《彩虹鸽》。要是你允许的话，我希望能把这本书献给你，以表达对你的感激之情，因为你也是这本书的一部分源头。





你永远最忠诚的

第一章　彩虹鸽降生


以拥有上百万人而自豪的加尔各答城，肯定至少有两百万只鸽子。每三个印度男孩子大概就会拥有十二只信鸽，比如翻飞鸽[1]、扇尾鸽[2]和凸胸鸽。在印度，驯鸽的技艺可以追溯到几千年以前，这种技艺已经给鸟迷们献上了两个特殊的鸽子品种——扇尾鸽和凸胸鸽。几百年来，无论是大理石宫殿里的皇帝、亲王和皇后，还是寒碜窝棚里的穷苦百姓，都对鸽子关爱备至。无论是印度富人家的花园、洞窟、喷泉，还是普通百姓的花果小田地，各自都有装饰和音乐，那就是色彩缤纷的彩鸽和咕咕叫的有着红宝石般眼睛的白鸽。

即使到现在，任何一个冬天的早晨，访问我们大城市的外国人也可以看到无数男孩子站在平房的房顶上，挥舞着白色的旗帜，在清冷的空气中向飞起的爱鸽发出信号。鸽群翱翔着飞过蓝天，犹如大片大片的云朵一般。开始的时候，鸽子是一小群一小群的，在主人的房顶上空盘旋二十分钟左右。随后，他们慢慢地飞高，所有来自城里各家的单独鸽群合并为一大群，越飞越远，飞出人们的视野。他们是如何一如既往地返回自己家的，让人百思不得其解，因为尽管房顶颜色不同，有玫瑰色、黄色、紫罗兰色和白色，但所有的房顶形状看上去都很相似。





然而，鸽子有一种惊人的方向感和对主人的爱。我见过的生物中最忠诚的莫过于鸽子和大象。我曾经跟鸽子和大象为伴，无论是乡村里的四足长牙动物，还是城市里的双翼飞鸟，无论他们漫游多远，几乎都能通过自己绝对可靠的本能回到他们的朋友和兄弟——人类——身边。

我的大象朋友名叫凯瑞，你们以前可能听说过他。我熟悉的另一个宠物是一只鸽子。他的名字叫齐特拉-格里瓦，“齐特拉”意思是“用鲜艳颜色画的”，“格里瓦”意思是“脖颈”，连起来说就是“长着彩虹脖颈的鸽子”。有时，他被称为“彩虹颈”。

当然，彩虹鸽生出来的时候并没有彩虹颈，他必须得经过一星期又一星期，才能长出羽毛；直到他三个月大的时候，他会长出鲜亮颈羽的希望还微乎其微；但最后，当他真正获得鲜亮颈羽的时候，他就成了印度我那个城里最漂亮的鸽子了，我那个城里的男孩子们有四万只鸽子呢。

不过，我还是从头开始讲述这个故事吧。我是说，从彩虹鸽的父母亲讲起。他的父亲是一只翻飞鸽，娶了当时最漂亮的一只母鸽，这只母鸽出自一个古老高贵的信鸽家族。因此，彩虹鸽后来才能够证明，无论是在战争年代还是在和平时期，他都是如此出色的信鸽。他继承了母亲的智慧和父亲的勇敢与机敏。彩虹鸽是那样机智灵敏，有时候在最后时刻会一个筋斗翻到敌人的头部正上方，逃脱魔爪。不过，这一点以后会在适当的时间和地点再说。

现在，让我来告诉你彩虹鸽还在蛋里时九死一生的经历。我永远都不会忘记那一天，当时母鸽生下了两只蛋，我一时失误，打破了其中一只。我真是笨到了家，甚至现在还感到后悔。谁知道呢？说不定打破那只蛋，世界上最出色的鸽子就灭亡了。是会有这样的事情的。我们的房子有四层楼高——房顶上盖有鸽巢。母鸽生下两只蛋的几天后，我决定清扫一下鸽巢。当时，母鸽正卧在那两只蛋上。我轻轻地抱起母鸽，把她放到我身边的房顶上。随后，我小心翼翼地拿起每只蛋，极其温柔地放到邻近的鸽巢里。然而，这个鸽巢没有在硬木地板上铺棉花或法兰绒。接下来，我就忙着清理鸽巢里的杂物。一清理完，我就拿着其中一只蛋放回原处。接着，我又伸手拿起另一只蛋，轻轻地而又牢牢地捧在手上。就在这时，有什么东西落在了我的脸上，就像风暴刮起房顶一般。原来是彩虹鸽的父亲正用翅膀怒气冲冲地扑打我的脸。更糟糕的是，他一只爪子抓在了我的鼻子上。疼痛万分，突如其来，我还不知道是怎么回事，就把手里的蛋掉在了地上。我全神贯注地打退公鸽，使他离开我的头和脸。最后，他终于飞走了。但是，来不及了：那只小小的鸽蛋落在我脚边，碎成了一摊。我对这只笨鸽，也对自己怒不可遏。我为什么对自己怒不可遏呢？因为我本该对公鸽的袭击做好准备。他以为我是偷蛋贼，就懵懂无知，冒着生命危险，阻止我抢劫他的窝。但愿我能给你留下深刻的印象，就是你在鸽子筑巢的季节清扫鸽巢的时候，应该预料到各种突然袭击。

不过，我们还是接着讲故事吧。母鸽知道应该在哪天用自己的嘴啄开蛋壳，以便让彩虹鸽来到这个世界。尽管公鸽几乎三分之一的时间都卧在鸽蛋上——因为他每天从早上到傍晚都卧在鸽蛋上——但他不知道雏鸽破壳的时刻什么时候到来。只有母鸽才确切知道那个神圣时刻。我们还不明白那种独特的无线电信号的特性，母鸽就是通过这种特性得知蛋壳内的蛋黄和蛋白已经变成了鸽宝宝。母鸽也知道如何轻击准确的地方，好让蛋壳破开，而不让鸽宝宝受到任何伤害。在我看来，这简直就像是奇迹。

彩虹鸽的出生完全像我描述过的那样。我注意到，大约从下蛋后的第二十天起，母鸽就不再伏在鸽蛋上了。每次公鸽从房顶上飞下来，主动要卧在蛋上的时候，母鸽就啄他，赶他走。这时候，公鸽咕咕直叫，意思是说：“你为什么赶我走啊？”

母鸽只是啄他啄得更凶了，意思是说：“请走吧。即将发生的事儿非常严肃。”

就这样，公鸽飞走了。这让我非常担心，因为我急切盼望这只蛋孵化，而且对它能不能孵出来感到怀疑。我越来越兴致勃勃、越来越充满渴望地观察鸽巢。一个小时过去了。什么都没有发生。又过了大约四十五分钟，母鸽把脑袋转向一边，倾听着什么——很可能是那只鸽蛋里的动静。随后，她微微地惊动了一下。我觉得她的整个身体都在震颤。随之，她下定了巨大的决心。只见她抬起头，对准目标。她两下就啄开了鸽蛋，露出了一只小小鸟，整个嘴，还有小小的颤抖的身体！且看母鸽，她非常惊讶。这就是她这么多天来期待的小宝宝吗？噢，他是多么弱小、多么无助啊！母鸽意识到鸽宝宝的无助的时候，就用胸前柔软的蓝色羽毛盖住了他。

第二章　彩虹鸽接受教育


鸟类世界中有两种甜美可爱的情景：一种是母鸟啄开蛋壳迎接小宝宝出生的时刻，另一种是母鸟哺育小宝宝的时刻。彩虹鸽得到了鸽爸爸和鸽妈妈最精心的抚育。对他来说，这种抚育就像人类对子女的拥抱一样，会给无助者温暖和幸福。对小鸟来说，这就像食物一样必不可少。这个时候，鸽巢里就不应该塞太多的棉花或法兰绒，而应该塞得越来越少，以免鸽巢的温度过高。一些无知鸽迷不明白，随着小鸽子越长越大，他自己的体内会散发出越来越多的热量。我认为，这段时间频繁清扫鸽巢并不明智。鸽爸爸和鸽妈妈允许留在鸽巢里的一切，都有助于他们的宝宝感到舒适和快乐。

我还清晰地记得，从出生的第二天起，每当鸽爸爸或鸽妈妈飞回鸽巢的时候，小彩虹鸽就自动张开嘴，像风箱似的展开肉红色的身体。鸽爸爸或鸽妈妈把自己的嘴伸进他大大张开的嘴里，送进他们吃过的小米粒在自己的器官里形成的乳状物。我注意到了这一点：送进他嘴里的这种食物很软。即便到鸽宝宝快一个月大的时候，鸽爸爸或鸽妈妈还是会把种粒在自己的嗉囊里留一段时间，让食物软化，然后再让它进入鸽宝宝柔弱的胃部。

我们的彩虹鸽食量大得惊人。鸽爸爸和鸽妈妈分工协作，一个忙着去寻找食物，另一个伏窝守着他。我想，鸽爸爸伏窝为他辛劳，辛苦程度不亚于鸽妈妈。难怪彩虹鸽长得胖乎乎的。他从肉红色变成了黄白色——这是羽毛长出来的第一个迹象。随后，他的身上就出现了一些刺一般的白色羽毛，圆圆的，有些硬，像豪猪[1]毛似的。挂在嘴巴和眼睛周围的黄色胎记渐渐消失了。喙也慢慢地长出来了，牢牢的，尖尖的，长长的。多么有力的下颚啊！彩虹鸽大约三个星期大时，一只蚂蚁爬过彩虹鸽的身边，想爬进鸽巢，彩虹鸽就卧在鸽巢入口。谁也没有告诉他怎么做，他就用嘴去啄蚂蚁。原来完整的蚂蚁，现在变成了两半，躺在了那里。彩虹鸽低下头，凑近那只死蚂蚁，查看自己刚刚做了什么。毫无疑问，他把黑色的蚂蚁当成了种粒，啄死了一个无辜的过路者。蚂蚁对鸽类是友好的。让我们希望他为此惭愧吧。反正，他一生剩下的时间再也没有啄死过一只蚂蚁。

等长到五个星期大的时候，彩虹鸽就能跳出鸽巢，到那只留在鸽巢附近的盘子里去喝水了。虽说现在他还得让父母亲喂养，但他每天都在设法自己寻找食物。他有时会站在我的手腕上，从我的手掌里啄起一粒种粒。他像玩杂耍的人向空中抛球一样，把食物在喉咙里抛接两三次，然后才一口吞下。彩虹鸽每次这样做的时候，都会转过头，望着我的眼睛，好像在说：“我做得不好吗？等我的父母亲从房顶晒完太阳飞下来的时候，你一定要告诉他们我是多么聪明。”在我喂养的所有鸽子中，彩虹鸽在能力发展方面仍然是最慢的。





就在那段时间，我有了新的发现。我以前从来不知道鸽子如何能在沙尘暴中飞行而不会失明。但是，在我观察不断成长的彩虹鸽时，有一天我注意到他的眼睛上蒙着一层薄膜。我以为他要失明了。惊慌失措之中，我伸出一只手，想把他拉到我的面前，以便仔细察看他。我刚一伸手，他就睁开了金色的眼睛，退到了鸽巢的后部。不过，我照样抓住了他，把他带到房顶上，在五月火热的阳光下仔细观察他的眼睑。是的，我终于恍然大悟：彩虹鸽眼睑上附有一层绵纸般的纤细薄膜，每当我把他的脸对着太阳的时候，他就会把那层薄膜盖在金色的眼睑上面。于是，我知道了，正是这层保护膜才使得这只鸟可以在沙尘暴中飞行或径直飞向太阳。

随后的两个星期，彩虹鸽要学习如何飞行。尽管彩虹鸽天生是鸟，但要学习飞行根本不容易。小孩子喜欢水，但在学习游泳技术的时候，都不得不犯错误，呛几口水。我的鸽子也类似。他张开翅膀的时候有些将信将疑，连续几个小时都站在房顶上，天空吹来的风没有加快他去飞行的进程。为了说清当时的情况，让我给你描述一下我的房顶。房顶四周有结实的水泥墙，有十四岁男孩子那样高。夏夜，我们大多数人都会睡在房顶上，那道墙甚至可以阻止梦游者从四楼顶上滑下来。

我每天都把彩虹鸽放在那道水泥墙上。他迎风站在那里，一站就是好几个小时，但仅此而已。有一天，我在房顶上放了一些花生，叫他跳下来啄。他用探询的目光看了我一会儿，然后从我身上转开目光，又低头看着那些花生。他把这个动作重复了好几次。当最后确信我不会把这美味可口的食物送上来给他吃的时候，他就开始在围栏上走来走去，不时地伸长脖子想去啄大约三英尺以下的那些花生。最终，过了伤心犹豫的十五分钟之后，他跳了下来。就在他的脚触地的时候，因为要在坚果上保持身体平衡，他就突然张开了迄今还没有张开过的翅膀，犹如鼓起了一面风帆。多么了不起的胜利啊！

大约就在这个时候，我注意到了彩虹鸽羽毛颜色的变化。他的羽毛不是毫不起眼的灰蓝色，而是一种富有光泽的海蓝色，令他浑身上下绚丽夺目。突然，一天早晨，他的颈部在阳光下像彩珠一样闪耀。

此刻就到了飞行这个最重要的问题了。我期待他的爸爸妈妈教他第一课。不过，我还是尽我所能，采取唯一的方式来帮助他。我每天都让他在我的手腕上站几分钟，然后我会多次上下晃动胳膊；为了在如此高难的位置上保持平衡，他不得不频繁地张合翅膀。这对他有好处，但我教的这部分到此为止。你也许会问，我为什么对这些事情如此着急。一是彩虹鸽学习飞行课已经落后了，二是印度六月份就开始下雨了，随着雨季来临，任何长途飞行都不可能了。我希望训练他能尽快学会辨别方向。

然而，五月底的一天，鸽爸爸承担了这项任务。这个特别的日子，一直到处横扫、冷却城市空气的凛冽北风刚刚停息了。天空像透明的蓝宝石一般清澈。天空如此晴朗，你可以看到我们城市的一座座房顶和最远处的一块块田野和乡村的一处处凉亭。下午大约三点钟，彩虹鸽站在房顶的水泥墙上晒太阳。一直在空中飞来飞去的鸽爸爸这时飞下来，落在他的身边，用奇怪的目光看着儿子，好像在说：“嘿，懒骨头，你都快三个月大了，却还不敢飞行。你是鸽子还是蚯蚓啊？”但是，这个拥有高贵灵魂的彩虹鸽没有回答。这激怒了鸽爸爸。鸽爸爸开始用鸽语咕咕隆隆对他鸣叫起来。为了摆脱那种咕咕隆隆的鸽语，彩虹鸽挪动了一下，但是，鸽爸爸跟在他的后面，咕咕隆隆，猛击他的翅膀。彩虹鸽自己继续越挪越远；鸽爸爸没有心软，而是加倍咕咕隆隆，紧追不舍。最后，鸽爸爸将彩虹鸽推到了最边缘，他只有一个选择，那就是滑下房顶。突然，鸽爸爸将自己整个身体的重量都压在了彩虹鸽幼小的身体上。彩虹鸽滑了下去。彩虹鸽刚滑下半英尺，就张开翅膀，飞了起来。噢，对所有关心他的人来说，这是一个多么令人振奋的时刻！下午，鸽妈妈正在楼下，蘸着那里的水，进行午后的梳洗，这时候她穿过楼梯上来，飞过去，陪伴儿子。他们在房顶上盘旋了至少十分钟后，才飞下来栖息。当他们到达房顶的时候，鸽妈妈很自然地收拢翅膀，落在那里。她的儿子却不是这样：他惊慌失措，就像走进又冷又深的水里的小男孩一样。他浑身颤抖，拍打翅膀，拼命滑过，以便保持平衡，落下的时候两只脚小心翼翼地踩住房顶。最后，他胸脯碰在墙壁上，终于停了下来，像我们合拢扇子一样飞快地收拢翅膀。彩虹鸽因兴奋而气喘吁吁，这时鸽妈妈抚摩着他，用胸脯依偎着他，仿佛他仅仅是一个急需喂养的小宝宝。看到自己的任务圆满完成，鸽爸爸就飞到楼下洗澡去了。

第三章　训练方向感


就像一位刚刚受过训练的潜水员一样，彩虹鸽已经克服了纵身跳入空中的恐惧，他鼓起勇气飞得更久、更高。一个星期之后，他能稳定飞行半个小时了；而当落到房顶的时候，他像父母亲那样动作优雅地俯冲下来，双脚触到房顶的时候，不再惊慌失措地拍打翅膀以便保持平衡了。

彩虹鸽刚开始飞行的时候，鸽爸爸、鸽妈妈陪伴着他，现在他们开始把他撇在后面，而且高高地飞在他的上方。有一阵子，我认为他们是想设法使他飞得更高，因为小鸽子总是努力想达到父母亲的水平。也许鸽爸爸、鸽妈妈是在给小家伙树立一个出色的榜样。但是，后来六月初的一天发生的重大事件，动摇了我的这种解释。彩虹鸽飞得高高的：他看上去只有平常的一半大。他的父母亲在他的上方飞行，几乎像人的拳头那样小。他们在他的上方盘旋，就像旋转木马一样有条不紊。这看起很简单乏味。我移开目光，不再看他们；毕竟久久地、定定地抬头仰望并不舒服。在我放低目光望着地平线的时候，他们被一个迅速移动的黑点锁定，那个黑点每一秒钟都在变大，我好奇能以如此速度直线飞行的鸟是哪种鸟，因为在印度，鸟类是以梵文[1]Turyak命名，意思是“曲线追踪者”。

但是，这只鸟就像一支箭一般直飞过来。又过了两分钟，我的种种疑虑都消失了。朝小彩虹鸽飞来的是一只隼[2]。我抬起头，看着这令人惊叹的景象。为了下到彩虹鸽的水平位置，他的父亲稳定翻滚，这时候他的母亲也同样一心一意飞快地曲线下落。还没等可怕的隼飞到距离天真的小家伙十码之内，彩虹鸽的两翼就被掩护起来。这时候，他们三个垂直向下飞行，避开敌人的飞行路线。隼没有被这种行动吓住，又发起了冲锋。三只鸽子同时下降，但隼进攻的时候用力太猛，把他带出去了好长一段距离，这又一次让他受挫。鸽子们继续在空中盘旋，不断下落。又过了一分钟，他们离我们的房顶近了一半。这时，隼改变了主意，他向着天空飞去，飞得越来越高：事实上，他飞得很高，鸽子们都听不到他扇动翅膀发出的嗖嗖风声了；他在他们的上方，他们看不到自己的敌人，会觉得自己安全，就放松下来。显然，他们飞得不像先前那样快了。正在这时，我看到，在他们的正上方，隼正在收拢翅膀：他正准备下降，刹那间，他像一块石头似的砸向他们。绝望之际，我把手指放在嘴里，发出一声尖厉的口哨，大声警告。鸽子们像落剑一样向下俯冲，但隼紧追不舍。每时每刻，他都在一寸寸地逼近他们。他落得越来越快：此刻，他和他的猎物之间几乎不到二十英尺了。毫无疑问，他是在瞄准彩虹鸽。我可以看到他的魔爪。“那些愚蠢的鸽子难道不想做些什么进行自救吗？”我在极度的痛苦中思考着。隼现在距离彩虹鸽如此之近——只要他们保持镇静就行了，而——就在这时，鸽子们兜了一个大圈，改为向上盘旋。隼紧追不放。随后，鸽子们在一个平稳而硕大的椭圆形路线上飞行。要是一只鸟在一个圆圈里飞行，他要么飞向那个圆圈中央，要么远离那个圆圈中央。此刻，隼没有明白鸽子们的意图，飞向了圆圈中央，在他们那个大圆圈里绕起了小圆圈。他的背一转向三只鸽子，他们就又一次俯冲，快要落到我们的房顶了，但那个阴险的家伙并没有放弃。他像一道黑色闪电随之而来。他的猎物以呈曲线的路线俯冲到房顶上，终于安全地躲藏在我张开的手臂之下！那个瞬间，我听到空中传来一阵尖锐的风声，大约在我头顶一英尺的地方，隼飞了过去，他的眼睛中燃烧着黄色的火焰，爪子像毒蛇的芯子一般抖动着。他飞过的时候，我能听到风声在他的羽毛中呼啸着。





在我的爱鸟那次九死一生之后，我开始训练彩虹鸽的方向感。有一天，我用笼子装起三只鸽子，向城镇东边走去。上午九点整，我将他们放飞。他们安全回到家里。第二天，我带着他们向西边走出相同的距离。一个星期内，在半径至少十五英里内，他们在任何方向都知道回我们家的路线。

在这个世界上，任何事情都不会一帆风顺，对彩虹鸽的训练最终遇到了阻碍。我曾经带着他和他的父母坐船顺恒河而下。我们出发时，大约是早晨六点钟。天空中飘着一些游云，一阵和风从南面吹来。我们坐的船上高高地堆着雪白的大米，大米顶上堆着一些红色和金黄色的杧果，看上去就像夕阳点燃的一座雪白的山峰一样。

我本来应该预测到，这样吉祥的天气也可能突然演变成一场可怕的暴风雨，毕竟，尽管我是一个男孩子，但我对六月雨季的反复无常有所了解。

我们刚走出二十英里，第一片季节雨云就飞快地掠过了天空。风速非常大，刮掉了我们船上的一面帆。看到机不可失，我就打开鸽笼，把三只鸽子放了出去。他们遇到了大风，拱身飞行，飞得很低，几乎落进了水里。他们这样贴着河面飞行了十五分钟，顶着强风，没有前进多少。但是，他们坚持不懈，又过了十分钟，只见他们安全地顶风转向，向陆地飞行。就在他们大约刚刚到达我们左侧的一溜村庄的时候，天空变得一片漆黑，倾盆大雨覆盖了一切，我们只看到一片片黑漆漆的水，闪电曲折，穿过黑水，跳着死亡的舞蹈。我放弃了再找到我的鸽子的所有希望。我们的船也差点儿失事，但幸运的是，我们的船搁浅在了一个村子的岸边。第二天早晨，我坐火车回到家里的时候，发现了两只湿漉漉的鸽子，而不是三只。彩虹鸽的父亲在暴风雨中遇难了。毫无疑问，这都是我的过错，在接下来的几天里，我们家陷入了哀痛之中。每当雨稍微停息，我和两只鸽子就上到房顶，目的是想细看天空，瞥见彩虹鸽的父亲。可叹的是，他再也没有回来。

第四章　喜马拉雅山上的彩虹鸽


平原上雨水过多、天气炎热，所以家人决定把我们带到喜马拉雅山去。你要是有一张印度地图，就会发现东北角有一个叫作大吉岭[1]的城镇，几乎跟世界上最高的山峰珠穆朗玛峰面对而立。坐上大篷车，从大吉岭出发，不紧不慢地旅行了好几天之后，我们一家、我自己和两只鸽子到达了丹坦小村。在那里我们所处的海拔是一万英尺。美国的山脉或阿尔卑斯山，到达这样的高度，至少会有一些积雪，但在处于热带的印度，而且是在喜马拉雅山上，几乎还不到赤道以北三十度，一万英尺以下并没有到达雪线，遍布各种动物的山麓丘陵丛林，九月过后非常寒冷，所有的居民都要南迁。

让我简单给你描述一下我们周围的环境。我们的石头和泥土盖成的房子俯瞰着一道道生长着茶树的小山谷。林木密集的山岭之间开辟出了一道道粗糙而雄伟的弯道，远处是一道道布满稻田、玉米地和果园的山谷。更远处耸起的是苍翠的悬崖峭壁，悬崖峭壁上面是数千英尺高的纯白山脉，那就是干城章嘉峰[2]、马卡鲁峰[3]和珠穆朗玛峰一线山脉。在黎明的第一缕曙光中，它们看上去白茫茫的，但是，随着光线越变越亮、太阳越升越高，一座座山峰在地平线不远处清晰展现出来，但刺破天空的正中处，太阳从那里泻下了一道道深红色的光线，宛若赐福的血液一般。

观看喜马拉雅山脉，通常最好是在早晨，因为一天的其他时候，喜马拉雅山脉被云雾笼罩。印度教徒都是非常虔诚的人，他们及早起床，观看崇山，向神祈祷。对祈祷者来说，还能有比大多数山峰依然无人走过、无人勘察的那些山脉更好的地方吗？他们的不可侵犯的圣洁是宝贵的东西，这种东西依然是一种神性的永恒象征。像珠穆朗玛峰这样的高峰是神明的象征。它们也代表着神灵的神秘，因为像我说过的那样，除了早晨以外，它们整天被云雾笼罩。到印度来的外国人以为，这些山峰他们想什么时候看就什么时候看，但是，什么时候不会让任何人有所抱怨，因为观看过珠穆朗玛峰早晨壮观的景象和令人敬畏的光芒的人都会说：“这太崇高了，不能整天观看。谁在他面前都无法持续承受这种震撼。”

七月是雨季，珠穆朗玛峰早晨那些景象不会每天都赐予我们。所有的山脉都处在最具破坏性的暴风雪的掌握之中。偶尔，在肆虐的暴风雪之上，那些山峰也会出现——一团密致坚硬的冰块和白色火光，在阳光下发出耀眼的光芒，而山脚下雪云旋转落下，犹如狂热的托钵僧在可怕的神灵面前狂舞。





夏天期间，我的朋友拉迪亚和我们的丛林知识老师老刚德来我们家拜访。拉迪亚十六岁左右，已经是一位婆罗门祭司；而老刚德，我们之所以总是叫他老刚德，是因为谁也不知道他的年龄。我和拉迪亚被交给最能干的这位猎人，目的是在他的指导下研究丛林动物生活的秘密。因为我在其他书里描述过他们，所以我自己在这里就不赘述了。

我们一在丹坦安顿下来，我就开始训练鸽子们的方向技能。每当晴天，我们就整个上午都向处在冬青和香脂森林中的更高山峰爬去，然后从寺院的房顶或从一个贵族的房子释放我们的鸟儿。临近傍晚回家的时候，我们总是发现彩虹鸽和他的母亲在等着我们。

整个七月份，几乎只有不到六个晴天，但在简直无所不知的刚德的指导下，在我的朋友拉迪亚的陪伴下，我们在短短的时间内游览了很远的地方。我们访问各个阶层的山民，跟他们待在一起。这些山民看上去很像中国人。他们举止优雅，热情好客。当然，我们都随身带着鸽子，有时候放在笼子里，但大多都放在外衣下面。尽管我们常常被雨淋透，但彩虹鸽和他的母亲都受到我们的精心保护，未受天气影响。

快到七月底的时候，我们三个人和两只鸽子已经游览过了锡金[4]每一座喇嘛庙（寺院）和男爵城堡。我们经过辛加里拉，那里有一座漂亮的小寺院。之后，我们继续向法拉特和未知的地方走去。最后，我们到达了鹰的故乡。我们四周是裸露的花岗岩悬崖，悬崖被冷杉丛和矮松团团围住，我们北面横亘着干城章嘉峰和珠穆朗玛山脉。这时，我们来到了一道深渊的边缘，放出了两只鸽子。在那种爽快的空气中，他们像一天结束后跑出学校的孩子们一样飞翔。彩虹鸽的母亲向上远飞，以便向她的儿子展示崇高的云天。

两只鸽子飞走之后，我们三个人谈起了鸽子飞过那些高峰时会看到什么。毫无疑问，他们面前会矗立着干城章嘉的两座山峰，比珠穆朗玛峰稍低些，但就像那座没有留下人类足迹的完美山峰一样圣洁庄严。这一事实在我们心里激起了深厚的情感。我们从远处看那座山，就几分钟，像上帝面前的一面镜子，我对自己说：“噢，你这圣洁的高峰，你这神圣与永恒，没有人会玷污你，甚至也没有任何人以轻微的触摸玷污你的纯净。愿你永远不被征服，噢，你这宇宙的脊梁和不朽的度量。”

但是，我给你讲述这些高峰，并不是想告诉你有关山脉的情况，而是要讲述我们在那里的一次历险。因为彩虹鸽母子俩已经飞走了，所以我们不再望向他们，开始寻找鹰巢，鹰巢在附近的一个悬崖上。喜马拉雅鹰呈棕色，闪着金黄色的柔光，羽毛看上去非常漂亮——是漂亮与力量的完美均衡——但也是一种凶猛的肉食动物。

但是，这个特殊的下午，我们起初没有遇到什么野兽。相反，我们在一个鹰巢里发现了两只毛茸茸的小白鹰。他们看上去像新生儿一样迷人。南风正吹进他们的眼里，但他们并不在意。把巢筑在迎风的方向，是喜马拉雅山鹰的本性。为什么？没有人知道。显然，那只鸟喜欢迎风站立，在风中他会飘浮起来。

两只小鹰快三个星期大了，因为他们已经脱下了生下来时像棉花一样的外衣，开始长出真正的羽毛。对他们这么大的鹰来说，爪子已足够尖利，喙也坚硬锋利。

鹰巢开阔宽大。鹰巢的入口平台——也就是降落处——大约有六七英尺宽，相当干净。但是，里面阴暗狭窄，堆满了大大小小的树枝、猎物的毛发和羽毛，猎物的其他部分都被小鹰吞吃掉了。鹰爸爸、鹰妈妈连骨带肉，掺杂着毛发和羽毛，吞吃掉了猎物的大部分。

尽管悬崖周围长着矮松树，但还是充满了鸟叫声。另外，奇怪的昆虫在冷杉树丛中嗡嗡叫着。宝石般的苍蝇扇动蓝色的翅膀，飞过淡紫色的兰花；大片大片大大小小的杜鹃花绚丽夺目，有时像月亮一样大。偶尔传来一声野猫叫，显然是午睡时的呓语。

突然，刚德吩咐我们跑十二码远，藏在一个灌木丛里。我们刚藏好，周围的嘈杂声就开始减弱了。又过了一分钟，昆虫不再嗡嗡叫了，鸟儿也停止了鸣叫，就连树木也好像因充满期待而一动不动。慢慢地，空中响起了一阵微弱的呼啸声。又过了一阵子，呼啸声变得更低了。一种奇异的尖叫声猛然传来，随后一只巨大的鸟儿飞落到了鹰巢边。风还在巨鸟的翅膀里呼啸着。根据巨鸟的体型，刚德认为那是两只小鹰的母亲。她停在空中一动不动，直到小鹰退到他们家的里屋。母鹰的爪子上挂着一只被完全剥掉皮的东西，像一只大兔子。母鹰落下来，把猎物放在巢穴入口处。你可以看到她张开的翅膀有六英尺宽。她像人叠纸一样收拢翅膀；然后，看到她的孩子们向她飞来，她收起爪子，以免刺伤小鹰没有盔甲的嫩肉。这时候，母鹰像瘸子一样跛行。两个小家伙跑过来，钻到了她半张半合的翅膀下面，消失不见了，但他们不想处在母亲的羽翼之下，因为他们饿了。于是，母鹰带着他们走到死兔旁边，撕掉一些兔肉，剔除上面的骨头，扔给他们吞吃。下面和周围又响起了虫鸟的叫声。我们从藏身的地方站起来，跟着拉迪亚向家里走去。我缠着刚德让他答应我，等小鹰羽毛丰满后，他再带我们来看。

于是，一个多月后，我们又回到了这里。我们带来了彩虹鸽母子俩，因为我希望彩虹鸽进行第二次飞翔，以便他绝对肯定地了解每一个村庄、每一座喇嘛庙、每一条湖泊与河流，以及野兽和其他鸟类——鹤、鹦鹉、喜马拉雅苍鹭、大雁、潜鸟、雀鹰[5]和雨燕。在这次旅途上，我们在距离鹰巢一百码远的地方走动。秋天的手指已经触摸了杜鹃花。火红的花瓣纷纷凋谢；许多英尺高的长茎干在风中飒飒作响。许多树的叶子已经开始变黄，到处都充满了忧郁的气息。十一点钟左右，我们打开鸟笼，两只鸽子飞向了宝石蓝的天空，犹如白色山峰上的船帆一样。

他们飞行了大约半个小时，这时候一只隼出现在了他们的上空。那只隼离两只鸽子越来越近，然后冲向他们。但是，猎物十分警觉，毫发无损地逃脱了。就在彩虹鸽母子俩飞快地降落到有树的地方时，隼的配偶出现，发起了攻击。母隼像她的丈夫一样飞扑向他们，但没有命中目标。看到猎物要逃脱，公隼对母隼尖叫起来；听到尖叫声，母隼停在了空中，只是在等待时机。鸽子们感觉安全了，就加速扇动翅膀，向南飞行，这时候两只隼尾随其后，从东西两个方向朝他们聚拢过来，他们连续拍击着翅膀，逼近鸽子。两只隼的翅膀形状像屠夫削掉了尾端的斧头，如暴风一般划过天空……一、二、三——仿佛长矛似的落下。彩虹鸽的母亲停住，仅仅飘浮在空中。这打乱了两只隼的如意算盘。现在怎么办呢？该扑向哪一只呢？这样的疑问花费时间，彩虹鸽抓住机会改变了路线，急速地越飞越高。过了一会儿，他的母亲也如法炮制，但她失去了时机，两只隼几乎飞跃到了她身边。这时，彩虹鸽的母亲显然一下子惊慌失措，担心那些隼追赶她的儿子，为了保护儿子——这样做完全没必要——她朝两个捕猎者飞去。又过了一分钟，两个捕猎者已经扑向了她。羽毛纷纷从空中散落下来！这个情景吓坏了彩虹鸽，他飞落到最近的悬崖上，寻求保护和安全。正是母鸽的失误葬送了自己的生命，说不定还会危及儿子的生命。

我们三个人开始在悬崖上搜寻彩虹鸽落在了哪里。这并非易事，因为喜马拉雅山非常险恶。就是没有老虎，也要担心蟒蛇。然而，我的朋友拉迪亚坚持要去，猎人刚德也同意他的做法，说这会增长我们的见识。

我们从所在的悬崖上爬下来，走进了一个嶂谷[6]。嶂谷地上的生骨使我们深信，某只猎兽前一天夜里在那里享用过猎物。但是，我们并不害怕，因为我们的向导是刚德，他是孟加拉装备最精良的猎人。很快，我们就费力爬过了裂口和缝隙，青苔上开满了紫色的兰花。冷杉和香脂的气味向我们扑鼻而来。有时候，我们会看到一朵还在开放的杜鹃花。空气寒冷，攀登没有止境。下午两点钟后，我们吃了一把寇拉豆（放在水里泡软的干豆）。我们到达彩虹鸽藏身的那个悬崖。让我们吃惊的是，我们发现这里是有那个两只小鹰的鹰巢——就是我们上次拜访过的那两只小鹰——现在羽毛丰满了。他们正卧在鹰巢的那块平台上，同时让我们万分惊讶的是，我们看到彩虹鸽就躲在附近一个平台最远处的角落里，畏畏缩缩，弱不禁风。看到我们走近，两只小鹰走向前，要用嘴攻击我们。拉迪亚的手离他们最近，受到了可怕的一击。这一击撕裂了他大拇指上的皮肤，鲜血汩汩直流。小鹰处在我们和彩虹鸽之间，我要够到彩虹鸽，只有爬到更高的一个悬崖上。像我们第一次来时那样，我们刚走到距离鹰巢六码的地方，刚德又向我们示意躲藏。我们迅速地躲到了一棵松树下面，很快空中传来了一阵柔和的轰鸣声，其中一只老鹰逼近了。几秒钟后，那只鹰飞进巢里的时候，响起了一阵高声的尖叫。她的尾羽擦过我们藏身的树木，我听到那种无言的呼啸声，这时候我的脊背上掠过了一阵剧烈的快感似的战栗。

让我再强调一下这个事实，就是人们有一个想法，认为鹰会把巢筑在难以接近的孤崖上，这种想法是错误的。一只猛禽或猛兽在选择家时，不需要那样小心翼翼，粗心大意也能负担得起。这样一个巨鸟的巢首先必须有充足的空间，以便能在家的外院张合翅膀，而且一个如此宽敞的地方不可能会难以接近。其次，鹰根本没有筑巢的技巧。鹰喜欢选择那种伸出悬崖洞穴外面的壁架，大自然已经在那里完成了三分之二的任务。最后的三分之一由那些鸟做就行了，仅仅是把一些树枝、落叶和草拾到一起，作为一张粗糙的床，在那里产蛋和孵蛋。

所有这些细节都是我们爬出藏身处，从远处仔细观察鹰巢得到的——这是第二次来了。毫无疑问，他们——就是两只已经长大的小鹰和他们的母亲——是我们的老朋友了。即使现在小鹰都长大了，母鹰还是习惯收拢爪子，以免伤到孩子们。不过，这是瞬间的；在她确定他们正在飞速跑来迎接她之后，她会张开爪子，牢牢地站在外面的壁架上。两只小鹰（尽管现在不应该叫他们小鹰了，因为他们羽毛丰满了）跑向前，躲在她大大张开的翅膀下面。但是，两只小小鸟在那里没待多久，他们不是想得到母爱，他们饥肠辘辘，想要吃东西，唉，她什么都没有带回来。见此情景，他们从母亲身边走开，迎风站在那里等待着。

看到刚德的手势，我们三个都站起来，开始攀登。在接下来的一个小时中，我们已经像蜥蜴一样爬到了鹰巢的顶端。就在我爬过鹰巢的时候，一股骨头和干肉发出的恶臭味扑鼻而来。这证明鹰尽管是鸟王，但并不像鸽子那样清洁。因为这一点，所以，与鹰巢相比，我更喜欢鸽巢。

很快，我们爬到了彩虹鸽身边，想设法把他放进笼子里。他看到我们很高兴，但却避开了笼子。天越来越晚了，我给了他一些扁豆吃。就在他聚精会神地吃东西的时候，我努力伸出手，想抓住他。这吓坏了可怜的鸟儿，于是他就飞走了。他飞起时发出的响声把母鹰从巢的深处引了出来。她向外张望，嘴微微颤抖，翅膀几乎张开，准备起飞。下面的丛林立刻静了下来，母鹰翩然飞去。我们觉得彩虹鸽在劫难逃。突然，一个黑影落在彩虹鸽的身上，我想那是猛扑过去的鹰；然而，那个黑影只在上面停留了一会儿，然后就后退了，但彩虹鸽吓得要死，在极度恐惧的驱使下，呈曲折航线飞走了，远远消失在了我们的视野中。

我深信我们已经失去了彩虹鸽。但是，刚德一口咬定说，我们一两天后就会找到那只鸟，所以我们决定等待，在那里消磨时光。

夜幕很快降临了。于是，我们在一些松树下面栖身。第二天早上，刚德告诉我们说，小鹰飞行的一天已经到来了。他总结说：“鹰从来不给自己的孩子上飞行课，他们知道自己的孩子什么时候做好飞行的准备。到时候，他们就会永远离开。”

整整一天，母鹰都没有飞回巢里。夜幕再次降临，小鹰们放弃了妈妈回来的所有希望，缩进了巢里。对我们来说，这是一个值得纪念的夜晚。我们爬得很高，以确保不受四足猛兽的攻击。老虎和豹子之所以在下面走动，不是因为他们怕高，而是因为他们像所有的动物一样要追踪猎物。羚羊、鹿、水牛和野猪都在山谷多、丛林密的地方吃草，因为他们可以去青草、树苗、甘美嫩枝生长的河岸，总之那里有他们的食物，那些以他们为食的动物也在那里寻找食物。因此，在高峰上，除了鸟类和野猫、蟒蛇和雪豹少数动物之外，没有其他猛兽。即使取代母牛的牦牛，也不会常常爬那么高，而且不会大批出现。偶尔会看到一两只野山羊，但没有更大的动物，所以我们的夜晚没有任何激动人心的体验。不过，黎明时分，寒冷刺骨，冻得人浑身发抖，这种体验得到了充分补偿。睡觉是不可能的了，于是，我坐起来，把铺垫的毛毯全都裹在身上，观察，倾听。万籁俱寂——就像紧绷的一面鼓，甚至吹一口气就会使它奏响似的。我感觉自己被四面八方刺骨的沉寂团团包围。偶尔，一只轻轻行走的野猫从不远处的树枝上跳下来，跳到秋天干燥的落叶上面，就像一阵爆炸似的噼里啪啦乱响。那种声音像一块石头落入不断上升的潮水里一样很快就消失了。慢慢地，星星也一个接一个地落下了。四处渐渐升起的迷雾越来越浓，这时像长矛的抖动一样，有什么东西在鹰巢里飒飒作响。毫无疑问，现在天正在破晓。那种飒飒声又从同一个地方升起。小鹰们正在梳理翅膀，就像人完全从睡梦中醒来伸懒腰一样。这时候，我可以听到附近传来一阵飒飒声。从这飒飒声，我判断一定是两只小鹰向巢穴的前壁架上走来。不久，传来了其他的响声。几只鹳从头顶飞过；几只像鹤一样的奇鸟飞在天空。附近，牦牛的吼叫声撕裂了寂静，就像他把自己的犄角穿过了鼓面一般。远处的山下，鸟儿相互鸣叫。最后，一道白光落在了干城章嘉山脉上。接着，马卡鲁峰随着背后一片巨大的蛋白色光晕出现了。那些像勃朗峰[7]一样高的较低山脉穿上了亮晶晶的乳白色衣服，石头与树木的形状和颜色跃入了视野。兰花随着晨露颤抖。现在，太阳像一头狮子，跃上天空的肩膀，积雪形成的地平线燃烧着鲜红色的火焰。

刚德和拉迪亚已经醒来了，站起身；这时候，作为一位训练有素的祭司，拉迪亚用吠陀梵语向太阳神沙维特力祈祷：





噢，你这东方沉默之花，

走着杳无人迹的老路。

继续神秘的无尘之路，

到达神的金色宝座，

在神的沉默和慈悲面前无语，

支持我们。





他的祷告吓着了两只小鹰，因为他们不习惯人的声音。但是，还没等他们激动发怒，我们小小的仪式就结束了，我们藏到了矮松下面。鹰妈妈没有留下任何早饭，两只小鹰向外张望，细看天空中有没有妈妈的迹象。他们凝视下面一群群鹦鹉和松鸦飞过的地方，那些鸟像蜂鸟那样小。在雪峰睡了一夜之后，大雁越过雪峰，继续向南飞行，很快也变成了像甲虫那样小，融入了太空。时间一个小时一个小时地过去了，但还是不见鹰妈妈的影子！两只羽毛丰满的小鹰感到越来越饿，开始在巢里烦躁起来。我们听到鹰巢里发生了一场争斗，争斗的强度和声音越来越大，其中一只鹰厌恶地离开了家，开始攀登悬崖，越爬越高。他没有用翅膀，一直向上走。到现在，已过了中午，我们吃起了午饭，但鹰爸爸、鹰妈妈还是没有出现。我们判断，那只留在巢里的鹰是妹妹，因为看上去她比另一只小鹰个头小。鹰妹妹迎风站在那里，望着远处，但她也变得情绪低落。尽管听上去可能奇怪，但我还没有看到过一只喜马拉雅鹰从出生到学会飞行的过程中不迎风站着呢。就像一名水手学徒坐着看海直到开始喜欢航行一样。到了下午两点钟左右，鹰妹妹在巢里等得不耐烦了，就出去寻找哥哥。她的哥哥眼下正落在高高的悬崖顶上，也迎着风。当妹妹上来的时候，他的眼睛发光。独自待着，他不开心，看到妹妹，他就不再闷闷不乐想着飞去寻找食物了。我从来没有见过鹰爸爸和鹰妈妈教自己的孩子飞行。这就是小鹰直到饿得受不了才会张开翅膀的原因。鹰爸爸和鹰妈妈对这一点一清二楚，这就是等小鹰长大那个时刻到来的时候，鹰爸爸和鹰妈妈撇下他们走开的原因。

小妹妹吃力地爬到了哥哥的身边，但可惜的是，那里容不下两只鹰。他们在高处没能保持平衡，由于妹妹的身体差点儿撞倒哥哥。哥哥马上张开了翅膀，风把他举了起来。他伸出爪子，但落地已经来不及了。他至少已经在空中两英尺高了。于是，他扇动翅膀，稍微升高，摇动尾巴，举止像方向舵那样，向侧面摇摆，时而向东，时而向南，时而又向东，在我们头顶盘旋，我们可以听到他的翅膀扇动发出的低低的风声。就在这时，一切都陷入了肃静，昆虫的叫声停止了，要是有兔子的话，兔子也藏进了洞里。就连树叶好像也在静静地倾听这个空中新帝王越飞越高时翅膀的拍击声。他不得不一路向上，因为只有飞得远，他才能找到自己寻找的猎物。一只鹰有时能在一千八百到三千英尺的高度看到地上四处跳跃的兔子，然后收拢翅膀，像闪电一般从空中呼啸而下。鹰飞来的可怕声音几乎使可怜的兔子进入催眠状态，兔子被定在原地，听凭敌人雷鸣般逼近，随后被鹰的利爪刺穿。

妹妹看着哥哥这样飞去，害怕孤单，也突然展开了翅膀。从下面吹起的风把她抛了起来。她也飘浮在空中，通过尾巴控制飞行方向，朝同伴飞去。过了一会儿，他们俩就不见了踪影。现在到了我们离开那些山寻找彩虹鸽的时候了。他可能已经回到了丹坦。但是，我们有必要搜寻每一座喇嘛庙和男爵城堡，因为在过去的飞行中，这些曾经都是彩虹鸽的地标。

第五章　追踪彩虹鸽


我们下山，进入下面峡谷的荒凉地带，突然发现自己到了一个越来越昏暗的世界，尽管几乎还不到下午三点钟。这是因为我们都在高高的山峰投下的长影中行走。我们加快步伐，寒气驱使我们向前。我们一下到一千英尺多，就变得相对温暖了些，但随着夜晚飞快降临，气温又降低了，促使我们希望到一家友好的喇嘛庙寻求庇护。我们到达了那个特殊的“客栈”，那里的喇嘛慷慨大方地款待了我们。他们只是在给我们上饭和陪我们去房间的时候才跟我们说话。他们晚上都在打坐中度过。

我们住在山坡上开出的三间小石屋里，前面是一块草坪，外缘被栏杆隔开了。借着提灯的光亮，我们发现小石屋里只有草垫。然而，夜晚很快过去了，因为我们太累了，睡得像母亲怀抱里的孩子们一样。第二天凌晨四点钟左右，我听到了许多杂乱的脚步声，这使我从睡梦中完全惊醒。我钻出被窝，循声而去，很快看清了几盏明亮的灯。我走下石阶，然后又登上一段高高的石阶，来到了喇嘛庙的中央小圣堂——悬岩下面的一个巨大洞穴，三面敞开。我面前站着八位提灯的喇嘛，他们默默地放好灯，盘腿坐下，开始打坐。昏暗的灯光落在他们黄褐色的脸上和蓝色长袍上，他们脸上露出的只有安详和慈爱。

过了一会儿，住持用印度斯坦语[1]对我说道：“为所有睡眠中的人祈祷，几百年来一直是我们的传统。在黑夜的这个时刻，即使患失眠症的人，也会神志不清；因为人们在睡眠时无法拥有意识思维，所以我们祈祷永恒的爱心可以净化他们，这样他们早晨醒来的时候，就会以纯洁、善良和勇敢的思想开始新的一天。你愿意跟我们一起打坐吗？”

我欣然同意。我们坐下来，为整个人类祈祷。即使到今天，我早早醒来时，也会想起喜马拉雅山里的那些僧人，他们每天为净化所有还在睡眠中的人们的思想祈祷。

天很快就亮了。我发现自己正坐在一座山的裂缝中，我们脚边横着一道陡峭荒凉的悬崖。银铃的叮当声在阳光照射的空气中柔柔地响起；铃有的是银色的，有的是金色的，它们轻轻响起，空气中弥漫着甜美的音乐：这是喇嘛们在迎接黎明的曙光。太阳吹响了胜利的号角——光明战胜黑暗、生命战胜死亡的号角。

我在下面碰见了正在吃早饭的刚德和拉迪亚。这时，一个为我们上饭的喇嘛说：“昨天，你们的鸽子来过这里躲避。”他描述了彩虹鸽的外貌，甚至准确到鼻头的特征、大小和颜色。

刚德问：“你怎么知道我们在寻找鸽子？”

平脸喇嘛连眼睫毛都没有动，就用平淡的语气说：“我能读懂你们的想法。”





拉迪亚用急切的语气问道：“你怎么能读懂我们的想法呢？”

喇嘛回答说：“要是你每天四个小时为所有生灵的快乐向大慈大悲的观音菩萨祈祷，十二年后，他就会赐给你读懂一些人思想的能力，尤其是那些来到这里的人的思想……你的鸽子来我们这里躲避时，我们给他喂食，治好了他的恐惧症。”

“治好了恐惧症，我的天哪！”我高声叫道。

喇嘛言简意赅而肯定地说：“是的，他深受惊吓。于是，我把他捧在手里，抚摸他的头，告诉他不要害怕。后来，也就是昨天早晨，我放走了他。他再也不会受到伤害了。”

“长老，你这样说能给出理由吗？”刚德礼貌地问道。

这位圣者这样回答他：“噢，猎人中的宝石，你一定知道，无论是动物还是人，只要不被敌人吓得魂不附体，就不会受到攻击，也不会送命。我亲眼见过，兔子摆脱恐惧的时候，甚至可以逃脱猎狗和狐狸的追踪。恐惧会蒙蔽人的机智，麻痹人的神经。把自己交给恐惧的人会死在自己手里。”

“可是，长老，你是怎么治愈一只鸟的恐惧症的呢？”

对于拉迪亚的这个问题，圣者回答说：“要是你没有恐惧，你不仅可以保持思想纯净，而且你的睡眠连续几个月都不受任何噩梦的玷污，那么，无论你接触什么东西都会变得无所畏惧。你的鸽子现在没有恐惧症，因为我曾把他捧在手里，将近二十年来，我在思想、行动和梦中都不曾害怕过。目前，你的爱鸟安然无恙，再也没有什么会伤害他了。”

他说话时平静而笃定，没有加强语气，我感到彩虹鸽的确安然无恙。为了不再浪费时间，我告别了佛陀的信徒们，向南出发。要是让我说的话，那就是我坚信喇嘛们是对的。要是你每天早晨为别人祈祷，你就能使他们以纯洁、勇敢和爱开始新的一天。

此刻，我们飞快地向丹坦走去。我们一路通过了那些变得越来越炎热、越来越熟悉的地方。我们再也看不见杜鹃花了。更远的山上，把树叶染成深红色、金黄色、樱桃色和青铜色的秋天，还没有来到这里。樱桃树上还挂着果实，树上长出了厚厚的苔藓，风已经吹掉了苔藓上落的兰花花粉，兰花像你的手掌那样大，盛开着紫色和深红色的花朵。在太阳的蒸汽热中，许多白曼陀罗渗出了露滴。树木开始显得更加高大、更加可怕。竹子像一座座刺破天空的尖塔一样向上飙升。匍匐植物粗如蟒蛇般盘绕着，挡在我们前行的路上。蝉鸣声持续不断，让人难以忍受，松鸦在树林中叽叽喳喳叫个不停。偶尔会有一群绿鹦鹉扇动着翠绿色的翅膀面对太阳飞过，随后就不见了踪影。昆虫大量繁殖。巨大的天鹅绒般的黑蝴蝶蜂拥着从一朵花飞到另一朵花，数不清的小鸟捕食着无数嗡嗡叫的苍蝇。我们受到了虫子最厉害的叮咬，偶尔不得不停下来，等着让横穿而来的毒蛇过去。要不是刚德有一双训练有素的眼睛，知道动物们来往于哪一条道路，我们已经被蛇咬死或被水牛顶死十几回了。有时，刚德会把耳朵贴在地上倾听。几分钟后，他会说：“我们前面，有一群水牛过来了。我们先让他们过去吧。”很快，我们就听到刺耳的牛蹄声带着凶险的噪音从下层丛林传来，就像一把巨大的镰刀不停地砍着我们脚下的土地。然而，停下来半小时，吃过午餐之后，我们还是继续向前行进。最后，我们到达了锡金的边界，那里的小山谷闪闪发亮，挂满了正在成熟的红粟、绿色的橘子和金黄色的香蕉，山坡上金光闪闪，缀满了金盏花，金盏花上面紫罗兰闪耀着柔和的光。

正在这时，我们看到了永远难忘的一幕。我们的脚下，狭窄的马帮路上，热浪滚滚，呈现出彩虹色：热浪太大，随着色彩簌簌振动。我们刚走了几码远，突然一大群喜马拉雅野雉霹雳般飞起，随后飞进了丛林，他们的翅膀像孔雀羽毛似的在暖烘烘的空气中燃烧。我们继续向前移动。又过了几分钟，另一群鸟飞了起来，但这些鸟是土黄色的。我困惑地请刚德说明原因。

他说：“幸福的孩子啊，你看到经过这里的大篷车装满了小米吗？其中一只麻袋破了洞。在麻袋缝好之前，几把小米漏在了路上。随后，这些鸟就来啄食。我们突然碰到他们，就把他们吓得飞走了。”

“可是，智慧王冠啊，”我问，“为什么雄雉看上去那样色彩鲜艳，雌雉却是土褐色？造物主总是偏爱雄性吗？”

刚德做了如下说明：“据说，大自然给了所有的鸟儿躲避敌人的颜色。可是，难道你不明白为什么那些野鸡如此光彩照人，即使瞎子也能看见他们，把他们杀死吗？”

拉迪亚惊叫道：“瞎子能看见？”

刚德回答说：“噢，你这小小的年龄挺机警的，瞎子看不见！真正的原因是野雉都生活在树上，在地面很热之前，他们不飞下来。在我们这个炎热的印度，地面以上两英寸的空气火烧火燎的，随着上千种颜色颤动；野雉羽毛的颜色与此非常相似。当我们看着他们的时候，我们看到的不是鸟，而是多种色彩的空气，这种颜色完全把他们伪装了起来。几分钟前，我们就差点儿踩到他们身上，以为他们不过是我们脚下的道路。”

“我明白了。”拉迪亚又虔诚地说道。“可是，为什么雌雉看上去是土褐色的？他们为什么不跟雄雉一起飞呢？”

刚德毫不犹豫地回答说：“当敌人走近，对他们进行突然袭击的时候，尽管雄雉没有想到行侠仗义，但他们会飞起来抵挡敌人的子弹。雌雉的翅膀不是那么好。此外，雌雉是土地那样的颜色，所以他们会张开翅膀，掩护自己的孩子，然后趴在地上，完全把自己的身体融入那种色彩当中。当敌人离开去寻找已被杀死的雄雉的尸体的时候，雌雉就会带着孩子们逃进距离最近的灌木丛……即使她们的宝宝已经长大不跟她们在一起，母鸟还是会单独匍匐在地，趴在那里，做出保护孩子的姿势。牺牲自我已经成为她们的一个习惯，无论有没有孩子，雌雉都会习惯性地张开翅膀。我们遇到她们的时候，她们就是这样做的；后来，她们才突然意识到自己没有孩子需要保护。当我们仍然继续向她们逼近的时候，她们就逃走了，尽管她们是可怜的飞行者。”

随着黄昏降临，我们安歇在锡金一个贵族的家里。他的儿子是我们的一个朋友。在那里，我们又进一步发现了彩虹鸽的种种痕迹。彩虹鸽先前曾经到过他们家好多次；他最近一次来到这个熟悉的地方之后，吃了一些小米粒、喝了水、洗了澡。此外，他还梳理了自己的翅膀，留下了两根小小的天蓝色羽毛，那羽毛颜色很漂亮，我的朋友就保存了下来。我看到那两根羽毛，心里乐得直跳。那天夜里，我睡得非常平静和满足。我睡得好还有一个原因，就是刚德吩咐我们要好好休息，明天出发之后，我们要在丛林中过夜。

第二天夜里，我们坐在丛林深处的树顶上。我常常想起我的那位锡金朋友的家和那个家里的舒适。

你自己想象一下，行进了整整一天，然后在危机四伏的森林中心地带一棵非常高大的菩提树上过夜是什么情景！我们花了半个多小时才找到那棵树，因为菩提树常常不长在高海拔地区，而且出于同样的原因，我们选择了那棵菩提树，我们要寻找一棵非常高大的菩提树——要是它过于细长，那对我们来说不起任何作用，因为一头大象后退撞在上面就会撞倒它。这种厚皮动物就是这样破坏一些非常粗壮的大树的。我们寻找的是一些非常粗壮的高大树木，大象的鼻子够不到上面的树枝，即使两头大象一起推撞也撞不断。

我们终于找到了一棵合我们心的树。拉迪亚站在刚德的肩膀上，我站在拉迪亚的肩膀上，直至我们探到像人的躯干一样粗的树枝。我爬上去，坐在一根树枝上，把绳梯从上面放下来。在丛林里，我们总是随身带着现在这种绳梯，以应付紧急情况。拉迪亚爬上来，在我身边坐下；随后，刚德爬上了树枝，坐在我们俩之间。现在，我们看到我们下面刚德刚才站过的地方不仅像煤矿的中心地带一样黑，而且还有两盏相互离得很近的绿灯闪耀。我们非常清楚那是什么。刚德愉快地大声嚷道：“要是我在下面再耽搁两分钟，那个有斑纹的家伙就会咬死我。”

看到猎物从身边逃脱，老虎发出了雷鸣般的吼叫，像诅咒一样鞭打着空气。一片紧张的寂静马上降临，覆盖了所有昆虫和小动物的声音。吼叫声变得低沉，渐渐远去，最后渗入了地下，似乎抓住了树根一般。

我们稳当地坐在了树枝上，刚德把极其柔韧的绳梯拴在自己的腰上，然后又拴在我和拉迪亚的腰上，接着把剩下的部分紧紧地绑在树的主干上。我们一次让它承受一个人的重量，检验绳梯是不是牢固。这个预防措施是为了防止我们的组员睡着时滑下来掉到丛林的地上，毕竟，在睡眠中，身体放松下来，会像石头一样落下。最后，在睡意来临的时候，刚德伸出手臂给我们当枕头。

我们已经做好了一切必要的防范措施，所以就聚精会神地观察下面发生的事情。老虎已经从我们的树下消失了。昆虫们重又欢唱起来。当一些巨大的身影从远处的树上轻轻落下的时候，这些欢唱一次又一次地静止几秒钟。那些是花豹和黑豹，他们整个白天都在树上睡觉，夜晚来临的时候纵身跳下来捕食。

豹子走后，青蛙呱呱叫，昆虫不停嗡嗡，猫头鹰也枭叫起来。各种喧响声像钻石一样打开了百万个晶面。各种声音跃入了各人的耳朵，就像阳光投射进无遮无拦的眼睛一样。一头野猪路过，折断了他面前的一切。很快，青蛙停止了呱呱叫；在丛林里的地上，我们听到高草和灌木丛像一个干草堆一样升起，然后随着一声叹息回落。那种柔和阴险、犹如浪花卷起的叹息声越来越近，随后……它慢慢地经过我们藏身的大树。噢，真是如释重负！原来是一条大蟒要去水坑。我们像树皮一样静静地待在树上——刚德害怕我们的呼吸声可能会把我们的位置暴露给大蟒。

过了一会儿，我们听到一两声小树枝断裂的声音，简直就像一个人打响指一样微弱。原来是一只公鹿的角被一些藤蔓缠住了。公鹿正在折断藤蔓，好让自己挣脱。公鹿刚过去，丛林就像预期的那样突然变得紧张起来。各种声音渐渐地消失了。我们同时听到的十几种不同的响声，现在只剩下了三种：昆虫的鸣叫、公鹿短促的哀号——毫无疑问，大蟒正在水坑附近扼杀他——还有头顶的风声。现在，一群大象来了，大约有五十头，他们来我们树下的地上玩耍。雌象的长声尖叫、雄象的呼噜声和小象们的奔跑声弥漫在空中。

接下来发生的事情我记不得了，因为我已经处在半睡半醒当中。在那种状态当中，我听到自己对彩虹鸽说起了鸽语，正经历着睡眠和梦境的深深的困惑。有人摇醒了我，让我万分惊讶的是，刚德轻声说道：“我再也撑不住你了。快醒醒吧！麻烦来了。一头疯狂的大象被落在了后面。这头掉队的大象一心想害人。我们没有高到他的鼻子完全够不到的地方，他要是举起鼻子再够远点，就会嗅到我们。野象既恨人又怕人，一旦嗅到我们的气味，他说不定就会整天守在这里，以便找出我们在哪里。小伙子，提高警惕。在敌人攻击之前，你要拔出警惕的剑。”

关于那头象的情况，刚德说得完全没错。在拂晓的淡光中，我可以看清一个小山似的黑影在我们的树下来回走动。他从一棵树走到另一棵树，嘎巴折断一些秋天还没有枯萎的多汁细枝。他似乎非常贪婪，一心一意吃着那些美食，一年中这个时候是很少见的。大约过了半个小时，他玩起了一种奇怪的游戏，就是把前爪搭在一棵粗树的树干上摆动他的鼻子。这使他看上去像一头远远伸展身体的猛犸。他那样长长地伸展，几乎触到了那棵树的顶端，拽掉了大树枝上面最美味的分枝。拽光了鲜嫩树枝之后，他来到紧挨着我们那棵树的一棵树边，如此这般故技重演。现在，他发现了一棵他用鼻子拽倒的细长树木，把前蹄搭在那棵可怜巴巴的弯树上，用自身的重量嘎巴一声把它踩断。他尽可能吃光了那棵树。在他这样吃早饭的时候，他的横冲直撞吓坏了鸟儿和猴子，鸟儿纷纷飞到了空中，猴子惊恐地从一棵树跑到另一棵树，嘴里含糊急速地叫着。随后，大象用脚踩在断树桩上，鼻子一直伸到了我们坐的树枝上。他刚伸过来，就发出了一声长长的尖叫，飞快地缩回了鼻子，因为所有的动物都害怕人的气味。大象独自嘟嘟囔囔，之后又把鼻子伸到了刚德的脸边。正在这时，刚德几乎对着大象的鼻子打了一个喷嚏。这吓得大象惊慌失措，他以为自己遭到了人类的围攻。他像一个受惊的恶魔一样，嗥叫着，尖叫着，飞快地穿过丛林，折断踩碎了他面前的一切。那些厚得像绿帆一样的鹦鹉飞入了天空。猴子尖叫着飞跑过一棵又一棵树。野猪和公鹿在丛林的地上惊跑起来。一时间，喧嚣声和骚动声响成了一片，乱成了一团。我们必须得等待一段时间，才敢从我们坐的地方下来，继续我们的归途。





那天晚些时候，我们幸运地遇到了一支沙漠商队，于是就骑着马回了家。尽管我们三个人累得要死，但我们看到待在丹坦我们家里鸽巢中的彩虹鸽就忘记了疲劳。噢，真开心！那天晚上睡觉前，我想起了那位喇嘛平静而自信地说：“你的鸟儿安然无恙。”

第六章　彩虹鸽出走


然而，我们回家后的第二天清晨，彩虹鸽又飞走了，此后没再露面。在连续四天当中，我们心急火燎地等待着他，随后再也忍受不了这种悬念，我和刚德就出发寻找他，做出决定，无论是死是活，都要找到他。这一次，我们租了两匹小马，一路骑到了锡金。经过每个村庄，我们都要向人们打听是不是见到过彩虹鸽，以确保我们的行动路线。大多数人都见过彩虹鸽，其中有些人准确描述了他的样子。一个猎人见过他在喇嘛庙的屋檐下休息，在一只雨燕的旁边筑巢；一个和尚说他看见彩虹鸽在锡金他们的寺院附近的河岸上，那里有一群野鸭筑巢。第二天下午，我们经过最近的一个村庄的时候，有人告诉我们说，他看到彩虹鸽跟一群雨燕在一起。

根据这些可靠的消息，我们来到了锡金最高的台地上，第三天夜里被迫露宿在那里。两匹小马昏昏欲睡，我们也昏昏欲睡，但我们好像刚睡了一个小时，我就被笼罩一切的紧张气氛惊醒了。我发现两匹小马僵立在那里；在火光和升起一半的月光中，我们看到两匹小马紧张地竖起耳朵，正在侧耳倾听，连尾巴都一动不动。我也聚精会神地倾听。毫无疑问，夜晚的寂静不仅仅是单纯的静止；静止是空的，但困扰我们的寂静充满了含义，就像披着月光的神灵走得那么近，我要是伸出手，就能摸到他的衣服。

正在这时，两匹小马动了动耳朵，好像要捕捉一种声音的回响，那种声音让人察觉不到地穿过了寂静。大神已经离开了，现在有了一种缓和紧张气氛的奇异感觉。我们甚至能感受到小草最轻微的颤动，但那也是暂时的。此刻，小马倾听起了来自北方的一种新的声音。他们正在努力绷紧每一根神经。最后，就连我也听到了那种声音。听上去像睡梦中小孩子打哈欠的声音，非常清晰，随后又消失了。接着，一阵拖长的叹息声划过了空中，声音越来越低，犹如一片厚厚的绿叶慢慢地沉入平静的水面。这时候，地平线上传来了一阵低语声，仿佛有人正在对着天际线祈祷。大约一分钟之后，两匹小马放松了绷紧的耳朵，摆动起了尾巴，我也感到自己轻松自在了。瞧！几千只大雁正在飞过高空。他们至少在我们上空四千英尺的地方，但还没等我听到，小马依旧早早就听到了他们飞来的声音。

大雁飞过，告诉我们黎明就要来了。我坐起来观望，星星一个接一个地沉落了。两匹小马开始吃草。我给他们放松了些缰绳；既然夜晚已经过去了，就不必把他们拴得离火那么近了。

在另外的十分钟里，黎明的极度寂静掌控着所有的一切，对我们的两匹马产生了影响。这一次，我可以清晰地看到他们俩抬起头又在倾听。他们在设法捕捉什么声音呢？我不必长久等待。只见不远处的一棵树上有一只小鸟在晃动；另一只鸟也在另一根大树枝上晃动。其中一只在歌唱。那是一只歌雀，它的叫声唤醒了万物。其他歌雀也鸣唱了起来；随后，其他鸟儿都争先恐后地鸣唱了起来！到如今，形形色色的东西都以炫目的速度显露了出来。因此，短暂的热带黎明过去了，刚德站起来，开始祷告。





那天，我们漫游到了我先前说过的新格里拉附近的那座喇嘛庙。喇嘛们非常高兴地给我们提供彩虹鸽的所有消息。他们告诉我说，前一天下午，彩虹鸽和那群住在喇嘛庙屋檐下的雨燕已经向南飞去了。

我们又一次带着喇嘛们的祝福，告别热情友好的“客栈”，踏上了追寻彩虹鸽的旅程。我们最后回望那些山时，只见它们在我们身后像一把把火炬一般燃烧。我们面前展现出秋色染成的树林，这些树林闪动着金黄色、紫色、绿色和樱桃色的光芒。





第七章　彩虹鸽的故事


在前一章中，我很少提及彩虹鸽去过的地方和发生的事情。在寻找彩虹鸽的十天旅程中，第一天刚德就确定无疑地发现了彩虹鸽的踪迹，但为了能连续看清那些事情，让彩虹鸽亲自讲述自己的历险故事会更好。要是运用幻想的语法和想象的字典，我们就不难理解他了。

十月的一天中午，当我们在大吉岭坐上回城的火车的时候，彩虹鸽卧在笼子里，开始讲述他最近从丹坦逃向新格里拉又飞回来的故事。

“懂得多种语言的主人啊，懂得所有人语和兽语的巫师啊，听听我的故事吧。听听一只可怜的鸟儿结结巴巴、漫无目的的叙述吧。因为这条河的根在山里，所以我的故事就从山里讲起吧。

“我在鹰巢附近听到和看到鹰的魔爪把我的母亲撕成碎片的时候，难过极了，决定去死，但并不是被那些阴险鸟儿的魔爪杀死。要是我注定要成为一顿美餐，那就让我成为空中之王的美餐吧。于是，我飞到鹰巢旁边的壁架上，但他们不愿伤害我。他们的巢里充满悲痛。他们的父亲被捕杀了，他们的母亲外出猎捕野鸡和野兔去了。到目前为止，小鹰们只吃过母亲为他们捕杀的食物，所以他们不敢攻击我并干掉还活着的可怜巴巴的我。在过去的几天里，我看到好多鹰，但我不知道他们为什么都不伤害我。

“随后，你们就来了，要抓住我并把我放进笼子里。我没有心情陪伴人类了，所以就抓住机会飞走了，但我记得你的那些朋友和他们居住的地方，在向南飞往丹坦的路上，我跟他们待在一起。在那两天里——因为我只飞了两天——我受到了一只刚刚长出羽毛的隼的攻击，我把他打得一败涂地。事情是这样的：一天早上，我飞过锡金下面的树林时，听到头顶风声呼啸。我明白此刻这意味着什么，就恶作剧地突然停飞，那只正扑向我的隼一下扑空，一头栽了下去，翅膀擦过了树梢。我升高疾飞，但他追了上来。于是，我开始在空中盘旋。我高飞，噢，飞得很高，我的肺在那里都呼吸不到空气了，就不得不再次下降。

“可是，我刚一下降，那只隼就带着一种凶多吉少的呼啸声扑向了我。幸运的是，此时此地，一生中我第一次尝试像我见到父亲做的那样翻滚，我成功地连续翻滚了两次，然后像喷泉一样蹿起。那只隼又一次扑空，他冲上来想继续攻击，但我没有给他机会。我向他飞去。就在我飞过他身边的时候，他下沉又升起，企图抓住我，我又翻滚了一次，狠狠地撞他，他失去了平衡。我不知道发生了什么，但当时我感到有什么东西把我往下吸，吸到了地球的深处。我的翅膀没有力量。我像鹰一样坠落——沉甸甸的，难以避免——用我的全部重量打在隼的头上。我想这一下把他打木了，他也下坠，消失在下面的树林里，但我很高兴地发现自己落在了一棵冬青树的树枝上。

“我是被一股气流吸下去的。自那第一次经历以后，我又有过许多次类似的经历，但我根本不明白为什么在一些树和溪流上方，空气变得很冷，形成一股涡流，把撞上这股涡流的鸟儿吸进去。在那次被涡流旋上旋下之后，我不得不学会在那些涡流中上下旋转地飞行。可是，我不讨厌涡流，因为我第一次遭遇的气流救了我一命。

“坐在那棵冬青树上，我变得很饿，这驱使我飞回家。幸运的是，再也没有无情的隼阻止我箭一般的飞行。

“不过，我从那只刚长羽毛的凶手手下成功逃脱，这让我找回了勇气。你一回到家，我就对自己说：‘他作为我的朋友，看到我活着，就不会为我担心。我必须重新飞过充满猎鹰的天空，检验自己的勇气。’

“因此，我开始了真正的漫长的冒险历程。我向北飞向鹰巢，在喇嘛庙停下来，那里的一位圣人早些时候曾为我祝福。在那里，我又拜访了我的老朋友雨燕夫妇。我继续向北飞去，路过新格里拉，最后到达了鹰巢。那些鹰已经飞走了。于是，我在那里舒服地生活，但不太高兴，因为那些鹰把各种垃圾都留在巢里，我害怕巢里充满害虫。尽管我白天待在鹰巢里，但我还是决定在树上过夜，不受可怕的虫子叮咬。这样在鹰巢里进进出出两天后，我在其他鸟儿中间赢得了巨大威望。他们怕我，也许是因为他们把我当成了一种鹰，就连那些隼也对我敬而远之。这给了我需要的所有自信，因此一天清晨，看见一队白色楔形的鸟儿飞往南方，飞得很高，我也加入了他们的队伍。他们不介意我加入他们，他们是飞向锡兰[1]和更远地方寻找阳光充足的海洋的大雁。

“飞行两个小时后，天气越来越暖和，那些大雁降落到了一条湍急的山溪上。他们不像那些鹰，极少向下看，而是望着地平线。他们发现遥远的天边出现了一小道白蓝色，就飞成一条直线，慢慢地降落，仿佛地面升起要迎接他们似的。很快，所有的鸟儿都纵身飞进了银色的溪流，因为此时看上去溪水与其说是蓝色，不如说是银色。大雁漂浮在水面上，但我知道我不会游泳，于是就坐在树上看他们的滑稽动作。你知道，大雁的嘴是多么扁平丑陋，但现在我明白其中的原因了。他们把嘴当作钳子来夹生长在两岸的贝壳。大雁不时地用嘴夹起一棵植物或一只贝壳，然后把它扭得变形，就像屠夫扭鸭的脖子一样。之后，它常常会在喉咙里把它用力压碎，整个儿吞下去，但还没等通过长长的喉咙，那东西就逐渐缩小，化为乌有。我看到其中一个家伙做得比这个还糟糕。他在河岸的一个洞里发现了一条鱼——瘦得像一条水蛇似的；他开始拽。他越拽，那东西变得越瘦越长。慢慢地，经过了一场可怕的拉锯战，那个可怜的家伙被从洞里拽了出来。随后，大雁跳上了河岸，把猎物甩在地上，用嘴压碎他按住的那一部分，几乎压成了肉酱，因此无怪乎那个扭动的猎物已经一命呜呼。接着，不知从哪里又走来一只大雁。（顺便说一下，难道大雁不飞或不游的时候，不是最丑陋的鸟儿吗？尽管他们会像梦一般漂浮在水池里，但在陆地上他们却像拄着拐杖的瘸子一样一瘸一拐！）现在两只大雁开始争斗，他们互相啄起了对方的羽毛，用翅膀拍打着从地面上跳起来用脚踢对方。就在他们忙着争斗，忘记了他们争斗的焦点的时候，一只像猫一样的家伙——可能是一只水獭——从芦苇丛里猛扑过来，抓住那条死鳗鱼，转眼就不见了踪影。这时候，两只大雁宣布停战，但已经来不及了！噢，他们还没有，啊——鹅有理智！跟他们比较，我们鸽子似乎是聪明的典范。

“他们停止争斗后，领头雁嚷道——‘咯，呱，呱，呱！’那一刻，所有的大雁都用力划水，增加冲力。他们又拍打了几下翅膀，飞到了空中。现在看上去他们是多么优美啊！宽大的翅膀发出柔和的飒飒声，他们的脖子和身体犹如天空中的图画，形成了一个非常养眼的楔形。这一幕我永远难忘。

“不过，每一个鸟群都有掉队者。一只大雁被落下了，因为他还在跟一条鱼搏斗。他终于叼起了那条鱼，飞起来，寻找一棵树，以便可以隐藏在上面吃鱼。突然空荡荡的天空飞来了一只巨大的隼，向他发动袭击。大雁飞得更高，但那只隼不依不饶，没有松懈。他们盘旋上升，发出了尖叫声和嘎嘎声。突然，一阵微弱却又清晰的雁叫声传来。是领头雁在呼唤那个掉队者，这分散了他的注意力。他几乎还没搞清楚状况，就回应了一声。就在那个时刻，鱼从他的嘴里掉了下来。那条鱼开始像一片树叶似的落下。那只隼俯冲下来，就在隼准备用利爪刺穿鱼的时候，空中传来了波涛般的轰鸣声。转眼之间，一只鹰飞下来，活像岩石从高高的悬崖落下一般。那只隼拼命而逃。这一幕让我欢天喜地。

“鹰的两只翅膀犹如两面巨帆，利爪闪电般伸出来，一下子抓住了那条鱼——随后，空中之王身披金褐色的盔甲悠然飞去，风吹皱了他膝盖上面的羽毛。远处，那只隼还在拼命奔逃！

“我很高兴他远去，因为我不得不四处飞行，寻找马帮路，我在那里可以找到人们掉落的一些种粒。我很快就找到了一些，吃了一顿还算像样的饭之后，栖在一棵树上就睡着了。我醒来后已到了下午三点左右。我决定继续飞行，飞到那座神圣的喇嘛庙去，拜访我的雨燕朋友们。我的飞行没有遇到任何不幸，因为如今我已经学会了小心翼翼地飞行。我一般都飞得很高，能清晰地俯瞰地平线。尽管我的脖子没有大雁那样长，但每隔几分钟我就会转过头，用眼睛的余光扫视一下，以确保没有什么东西在后面攻击我。

“我及时到达了那座寺庙，这时喇嘛们正准备好站在小圣堂边缘，以便在日落时分向世界赐福。雨燕夫妇在巢穴附近飞来飞去，他们安顿三个小宝宝上床睡觉了。当然，他们很高兴接待我。晚祷仪式后，喇嘛们喂我吃食，那位亲切的老喇嘛说了一句祝福的话，就是有人所说的“大慈大悲”那样的祝福，赐福与我。随后，我从他的手里飞走的时候，感到无所畏惧。在那种身心状态中，我飞进了自己的窝。我的窝巢在喇嘛庙屋檐下，紧挨着雨燕。

“十月的夜晚是寒冷的。清晨，当喇嘛们敲钟的时候，小雨燕们飞来飞去，练习飞行。我和他们的父母亲不得不飞起来，以摆脱早晨的寒冷。那天，我待在那里，帮助他们为南飞做准备。我惊讶地得知，他们打算在他们要去的锡兰或非洲筑巢。他们对我解释说，筑一个雨燕巢绝不是一件容易的事儿。接着，为了满足我的求知欲，他们向我讲述了他们的筑巢技巧。”

第八章　彩虹鸽的冒险历程（续）


“为了向你阐明雨燕筑巢的技巧，让我首先指出雨燕的缺陷。他有一张适合捕捉飞虫的宽嘴巴，能让他在飞行时捕捉猎物。他扑向昆虫的时候，能从他的大嘴里逃脱的寥寥无几。因为雨燕很小，所以他举不起太重的东西。难怪他的房子都是用还没有中号针粗的稻草、小树枝这种细长材料盖的。

“我第一次看见雨燕时，他一副畸形的无法正常活动的样子。所有的雨燕都知道他们有一双差劲的腿，几乎无法保持身体的平衡。他的鱼钩般的小脚完全适合贴在一些地方，直接从身体里暴露出来；他的鱼钩般的小爪子似乎不灵活。他的身体和脚之间的腿很短，这使他失去了弹性，腿比较长，会给其他鸟儿提供这种弹性。难怪他不能蹦跳。不过，他的一个优点弥补了这个缺陷——他们能依附在石壁、大理石屋檐和房屋的雪花石膏中楣上，其他鸟儿都做不到。我就曾见过我的朋友雨燕紧紧地抓住光滑的檐壁，好像那是有瓦楞的表面似的。

“在这些不利因素下，他所能做的就是挑选屋檐正下方的墙洞作为他的家。但是，他在那里不能下蛋，因为蛋会滚下来，所以他会抓住一些飞舞的稻草和小小的落叶，用唾液把它们粘在窝巢的石面上。这就是他筑巢技术的秘诀。他的唾液非常奇妙，能像木匠最好的粘柜胶一样变干和坚硬。等巢筑好之后，雨燕太太就会产下又长又白的蛋。在雨燕当中，母雨燕并不像鸽子那样自由。我们的母鸽跟公鸽享有同等的权利，但母雨燕总是要进行更多的劳动。比如，雨燕先生从来不孵蛋；他让太太来做。一天当中，他偶尔给太太送些食物，但其他醒着的时刻他都去找别的太太同样也忙着孵蛋的公雨燕。我曾对我的朋友雨燕说过，他应该仿效鸽子，给太太更多的自由，但他似乎以为这只是我开的一个玩笑。





“最后，我们的准备工作做完了，一个晴朗的秋天的早晨，我和五只雨燕由雨燕先生领航向南方出发了。我们从来没有飞过直线，而是向东或向西呈之字形前行，不过我们总的来说还是向南飞行。雨燕吃着漂浮在河上和湖上的苍蝇和小虫子。他们每小时飞行五十英里左右——一只小小鸟，速度快得让人目眩——雨燕不喜欢树林，因为他们在搜寻小虫子时，目光定定地看着下面，翅膀可能会被树枝折断。他们比较喜欢开阔清澈的水面。他们张开镰刀般长长的翅膀，划开空气，快得就像鹰扑向猎物一般。想一下雨燕的眼睛和嘴巴是多么精确！他在水面上旋转的时候，如此轻松自如地抓起几只飞虫，他穿越的空间完全扫清了所有的蠓虫和苍蝇，刚才这些蠓虫和苍蝇还在阳光下手舞足蹈呢。

“我们就这样飞越过溪流、池塘和湖上空。顺便说一下，雨燕先生匆匆吃了一些食物，匆匆喝了几口水。雨燕飞过水面时，会溅起几滴水，他会以飞快的速度吞下这些水珠。难怪他不喜欢在一个挤满了大树枝、落叶松和树苗的地方飞行。

“但是，在开阔地方如此频繁地飞行也有弊端。当雨燕以这样的速度捕食昆虫的时候，雀鹰可能会从上面袭击他。在这种情况下，雨燕无法下沉，因为那会意味着被淹死。我必须给你们讲述一下我们的朋友们遭遇的一次袭击。一天下午，雨燕们正在一片广阔的湖面上捕食，当我飞来飞去密切注视小雨燕的时候，一只雀鹰飞扑下来。既然我承诺要照看小雨燕，我就必须立即行动，哪怕冒着生命危险。我毫不犹豫地纵身扑下去，翻了个筋斗，将身体挡在敌人和小雨燕之间。雀鹰绝没有想到鸽子家族的成员会如此大胆，他也没有估算我的重量。我至少比他重五盎司。他用利爪向我的尾巴发起了攻击，拽下了几根羽毛，他以为在空中盘旋了一会儿自己得到了什么。还没等他意识到他只是抓住了几根羽毛，所有的雨燕就已经贴住树皮，安然无恙，让他够不到了。但是，小雀鹰非常愤怒，带着大雀鹰那样的愤怒扑向我。然而，他的身体很小，爪子更小，我知道它们根本刺穿不了我的羽毛。于是，我接受了他的挑战，向上翻了个筋斗。他紧追不舍。我迅速下冲，他也跟着下冲。接着，我开始攀升，他像先前一样紧追不舍。但是，那些小隼害怕高空，他的翅膀现在慢了下来。相对于我的两只翅膀扇动，他只能扇动一只翅膀。看到他失望而疲倦，我计划给他好好上一课。我一有设想，就实施自己的计划。我快速下冲。雀鹰也跟着下冲，向下、向下、向下！湖水冲我们升起，每时每刻都在升高，直到湖面看上去还没有我的翅膀宽。接着，我向前冲了几英寸，借着一股暖流，我向上飞去。你们知道，洼地和山谷地区的空气遇热后，会有一种朝比较凉爽的地区快速流动的倾向。当我们鸟类突然向上飞行的时候，需要寻找这些气流来帮助我们。此刻，我连翻了三个筋斗，而当我低头向下望的时候，我发现那只雀鹰溺在了水里。他没能赶上气流。钻进水里半天后，他吃力地飞上了岸，丢脸地躲到厚厚的树叶下面。那个时刻，雨燕钻出了躲藏地，向南飞去。

“第二天，我们遇到了一些野鸭。他们都有我这样的彩色喉颈，但他们的其他部位却像雪一样白。他们是河鸭，习惯顺着山溪而下，捕食鱼类。他们飞远后，会从水里飞起来，飞回出发地。他们就这样像梭子似的飞来飞去。他们的喙和野鹅的一样扁平，里面有凹痕，因此一旦夹住一条鱼，他们的喙就绝不会滑脱。他们好像不大关心捕食水生贝壳类生物，可能只是因为湖里的鱼太多了。雨燕不喜欢有野鸭的地方，因为野鸭的翅膀不断扇动空气，常常扇走飞过水面的小昆虫。尽管如此，但雨燕还是非常高兴看到这些鸭子，这些鸭子喜欢山涧，靠山涧为生，从不过问静水，静水对大多数鸭子来说十分宝贵。

“正是这些鸭子警告我们，提防大批出没于那些地区的猫头鹰和其他黑夜杀手。于是，我们尽最大努力躲在猫头鹰进不去的小地方。尽管在一棵树里找到让雨燕栖身的小洞并不难，但我决定留在开阔地碰碰运气。夜幕很快降临了。不久，我什么也看不见了。黑暗一步步加深，仿佛一层层黑布罩在上面。我向鸽子的神灵祈祷，努力入睡。但是，周围猫头鹰不断枭叫，谁能睡着呢？夜里，我心惊胆战，不到一个小时就能听到某只鸟儿痛苦的尖叫。猫头鹰也扬扬得意地枭叫。时而八哥，时而夜莺，在猫头鹰的魔爪下惨叫，然后丧生。尽管我闭着眼睛，耳朵还是听到了发生的残杀。一只乌鸦尖叫着。随后，一只接一只乌鸦尖叫了起来。一群乌鸦几乎是惊恐地飞起，撞在树上粉身碎骨。但是，与其被猫头鹰嘴啄爪撕杀死，还不如撞死在树上。不久，让我百思不解的是，我嗅到了空气中黄鼠狼的气味。于是，我感到死亡临近，就睁开眼睛，只见一道淡白色的光照在所有的东西上。在距离我大约六英尺远的地方，有一只黄鼠狼。尽管会增加我被猫头鹰杀死的危险，但我还是飞了起来。果然，一只猫头鹰尖声枭叫着飞了过来，还有两只猫头鹰也尾随而来。我听到了他们拍打翅膀的声音。根据声音的特点，我知道我们正飞行在水域上空，因为即使最细微的羽毛颤动也会在水面上产生回应。我向任何方向都不能飞得很远，因为我每次最远只能看六英尺远，所以我在空中等待，寻找着悬在河面上空大树枝上吸起河气的涌流。哎呀，那些猫头鹰已经追上了我，但我翻了个筋斗，接着在空中晃了一圈。猫头鹰没有放弃追踪。我越飞越高。这时，如水的月光从我的翅膀上洒下来。我可以看得更远了点，这又让我有了勇气。但是，我的敌人没有发善心。他们也飞了上来，越来越多的月光落在了他们的眼睛上，使他们眼花缭乱，不过还没有完全眼花缭乱。突然，其中两只猫头鹰向我扑来。我又向上飞去。猫头鹰扑空了——瞧啊！他们相互扑到了一起。他们的爪子扣在一起，翅膀在空中无助地拍动着，他们像恶魔般尖叫着，掉在了河岸的芦苇丛中。

“此刻，我仔细环顾四周，吃惊地发现我已经飞向了黎明，而不是飞向了月亮。我的惊恐万分的眼睛没有真正看清。不过，周围不再有猫头鹰；他们开始寻找藏身处，以躲避越来越强的阳光。尽管我感到安全了，但我还是避开高大树木的巨大阴影，因为即使现在，猫头鹰也可能会潜伏在那里。我待在树顶的一根细枝上，树顶抓住了太阳发出的一道箭一样的光芒，把它变成了一把舞动的金伞。慢慢地，阳光向下铺展开来，直到下面的白色激流随着黄鼠狼眼睛一样的颜色颤抖。

“就在这时，我看到了在河岸上发生的让我震惊的一幕。只见两只比木炭还黑的大乌鸦正在用嘴又啄又戳一只绊在芦苇丛中的无助眨眼的猫头鹰。因为太阳的照耀，所以猫头鹰睁不开眼睛。当然，夜间大多数时候是猫头鹰对乌鸦进行杀戮，现在轮到乌鸦对猫头鹰的错误进行报复了，但我受不了两只乌鸦杀死那只被困的猫头鹰的一幕。因此，我飞离那两个凶手，寻找我的朋友雨燕们去了。我讲述了自己其中的一些经历，他们的父母亲告诉我说，他们听到了可怕而痛苦的叫喊声，这使他们难以入睡。雨燕先生问外面的一切是不是安全，我想是安全的。当我们出来时，我发现那只可怜的猫头鹰躺在芦苇丛中死了！

“说来也怪，那天早晨，我们在溪流上没有看到鸭子。显然，他们一大早已经飞向了南方。于是，我们也决定飞向南方。我们计划路上不寻找其他鸟类同行。因为在这个迁徙的季节，无论鸽群、松鸡群或其他鸟类去哪里，猫头鹰、隼和鹰这类敌人都会跟踪。为了避免危险和看到我们先前看到的那种惊人情景，我们飞向东方，向东飞了整整一天后，我们到锡金的村庄休息。第二天，我们向南飞了半天时间，又开始向东飞。这种兜圈飞行花费了很长一段时间，但这为我们省去了大量麻烦。有一次，我们遇上了一场暴风雨，被刮进了一个湖区，我在那里看到了惊异的一幕。我站在树顶上，看到下面有许多家养的鸭子浮在水面上，各自的嘴里都衔着一条鱼，但谁都没有吞下去。我以前从来没有见过鸭子能抵制吃鱼的诱惑，因此我叫雨燕观看这一景象。他们紧贴着好几棵树的树皮，看着那些鸭子，却简直不敢相信自己的眼睛。这些鸭子是怎么回事？不久，一条船映入眼帘，由两个扁平脸、黄皮肤的人撑着。看到他们后，那些鸭子都尽可能快地划到了船边。划到船边，他们跳上去，随后——你能相信吗？——他们把叼的鱼都吐到了一只大鱼篓里，然后跳下水又去捕鱼，这持续了至少两个小时。显然，那些藏缅渔夫从不撒网。他们在鸭脖子上拴紧一根绳子，勒得他们几乎喘不过气来，然后把他们放进河里捕鱼。无论捕到什么，鸭子们都会送给他们的主人。等鱼篓满后，主人就解开鸭脖子上的绳子。随后，鸭子扑进湖里，饱餐一顿全鱼宴。

“现在，我们远离湖边，飞行一段时间，寻找庄稼地。到了那里，雨燕们扑向在新割的庄稼地里飞来飞去的昆虫，狼吞虎咽。尽管我不吃昆虫，但我吃粮食也吃得饱饱的。我站在稻田的篱笆上的时候，听到有人在敲打什么东西。听上去很像是苍头燕雀用嘴啄开樱桃，以便够到里面的籽儿。（一只小鸟的嘴有胡桃钳那样的威力，这不奇怪吗？）但是，我走近篱笆下面发出响声的那个地方的时候，又发现了一只鸟——那是一只喜马拉雅山画眉。他不是在忙着啄樱桃籽，而是在啄一只慢慢移动的蜗牛。嗒嗒，嗒嗒——嗒！他不断地敲了又敲，直到那只蜗牛被震得一动不动。画眉抬起头，环顾四周，踮起脚尖，张开翅膀，飞快地瞄准目标，连啄了三下——嗒嗒嗒！蜗牛壳裂开，露出了一只美味可口的蜗牛。画眉用嘴把蜗牛从壳里啄出来，他的嘴正微微流血。显然，他把嘴张得太大了，嘴角都受伤了。他嘴里衔稳蜗牛后，飞起来，消失在了一棵树上，他的伙伴在那里等着吃晚饭呢。

“我们通过锡金的稻田上空后剩下的行程都平安无事。唯一值得记住的事情是森林里的男人诱捕孔雀。这些鸟儿来到炎热的南部沼泽，寻找食物和温暖，这时孔雀吃的蛇和其他动物在北方都会进入越冬地。

“孔雀和老虎都相互羡慕对方。孔雀喜欢观看老虎的皮毛，老虎欣赏孔雀美丽的羽毛。有时候，在水坑边，老虎站在那里凝视着大树枝上孔雀的羽毛，孔雀会伸长脖子饱览老虎漂亮的斑纹皮毛。这时候，人类——永恒的侵略者来到了现场。比如，有一天，一个人带来了一块画得酷似老虎皮毛的布，任何一只鸟看后都不能说这不是真的老虎。于是，他把绳索套在一棵树的树枝附近，悄悄地溜走了。通过画布的气味，我可以断定那不是老虎，但孔雀根本没有嗅觉，他们吃了自己眼睛的亏。所以，不到几个小时，一对孔雀飞过来，从树梢上凝视着那只假老虎，同时越飞越低。他们自欺欺人，认为这只老虎在睡觉。凭借这种错觉，他们胆子越来越大，飞得很近，站在靠近绳套的那根树枝上。没过多久，他们便走进了陷阱，但他们俩是如何走进一个陷阱的，我无法理解。他们一落入陷阱，就绝望地尖叫起来。这时，诱捕者就过来，又对他们玩起了花招。他抛起两顶帆布大黑帽，各套在两只孔雀的头上，掩盖住了可怜的孔雀的眼睛。眼前一旦变黑，鸟儿就不大反抗了。这时候，那个人绑住孔雀的双脚，以免他们走动，随后，他把孔雀分别挂在竹竿的两端，慢慢地把住竹竿中央，放在肩上，走了。孔雀的长尾巴像五彩的瀑布一样在他身前身后垂下。

“我的冒险历程到此为止。第二天，我告别雨燕。他们继续向南飞，我很高兴地回家，成了一个更聪明、更伤心的鸟儿。现在，”彩虹鸽说，“告诉我，为什么鸟兽相互之间有那么多杀戮和伤痛？我想，你们所有的人都不会互相伤害。你们会吗？可是，鸟兽会。这一切使我伤心透了。”





第二部





第一章　彩虹鸽战前训练


我们回城之后，到处都流传着欧洲某地即将发生一场战争。冬天即将到来，我决定对彩虹鸽进行如此这般必要的训练，以便他应召，成为英国作战部的一名信鸽。因为彩虹鸽习惯了喜马拉雅山东北部的气候，所以他会成为欧洲任何一个国家的军队的一名无价信使。即使现在借助电报和无线电，任何军队也无法免除信鸽的帮助。当目前这个故事自行展开的时候，你对所有这一切就会明白。

在为战时特殊工作训练鸽子时，我遵循刚德认可的我自己的一项计划。顺便说一下，这位老朋友跟我们一路来到了城里。他在我的家里小住了两三天，然后决定离开，说：“城市让人难以忍受。我永远不喜欢任何城市，但这座城市让我害怕，又是有轨电车，又是汽车。我要是不尽快抖落脚上的城市尘土，就会完全成为一个胆小鬼。丛林里的老虎不会吓倒我，但我对汽车不敢这样说。现代城市的一个十字路口一分钟危及的生命，要比最危险的森林里的一天危及的还多。再见！我还是去树林吧，那里沉静，空气没有恶臭和灰尘，天空高远，呈蓝绿色，没有纵横交错的电线杆和电报线。我听到的不是工厂的汽笛声，而是鸟儿的鸣唱；我要面对的是无辜的老虎和黑豹，而不是小偷和枪手。再见！”

但是，在离开之前，刚德帮我买了大约四十多只信鸽和一些筋斗鸽。你可能会问我偏爱这两种鸽子的原因。尽管我不知道我为什么对筋斗鸽和信鸽情有独钟，但扇尾鸽、凸胸鸽和其他鸽子适合观赏，却不实用，这话没错。我们家有一些这种鸽子，但最终证明他们很难跟信鸽和旅鸽结伴，所以我最后完全欣赏起了这些纯粹的飞行员。

在印度，我们有一个我并不喜欢的奇异风俗。要是你卖一只信鸽，无论是以多么昂贵的价格卖出去的，这只鸽子从新主人那里飞回你那里，便又会成为你的财产，无论价值多少，你都不用退还卖鸽子的钱。我知道这在鸽迷当中已成公认的习俗，所以我首先必须得让这些新得到的宠物喜欢我。我花钱买了他们，就不希望他们飞回到他们从前的主人那里。我尽最大努力让他们忠心耿耿，珍爱他们的新家。但是，生活是现实的。我不得不从最必要的步骤开始。头几个星期，我不得不绑住他们的翅膀，以确保他们完全在我们家的房顶范围内。绑住鸽子的翅膀，以免他们飞走，这是一种微妙的技巧。你拿一根线，把线的一头穿过鸽子的一只翅膀，然后从另一只翅膀下面，非常接近翅膀根部的地方，穿过去，直到环绕整个翅膀。接下来，你用线的另一头按照同样的步骤穿过第一只翅膀下面，越过第二只翅膀，如此这般直至翅膀末端，两根线头在那里系在一起。这非常像织补东西。这是一种完全没有痛苦的囚禁方式，因为尽管这样会阻止鸽子飞行，但并不妨碍鸽子张合翅膀。他既能伸展翅膀，也能用嘴按摩翅膀。之后，我常常把新鸽子放在房顶的不同角落，以便他们能站着不动，用眼睛适应新环境的色彩和特性。这个过程至少需要十五天。

在这里，我必须记载彩虹鸽在被用上述方法绑住翅膀后做的一件巧妙的事情。十一月初，我卖了彩虹鸽，就是为了看看他被松开细线的捆绑后会不会飞回到我的身边。

好吧，买走彩虹鸽两天后，他的新主人就来找我说：“彩虹鸽已经逃跑了。”

“怎么逃跑的？”我问道。

“我不知道，但我在屋里找不到他了。”

“你绑住他的翅膀了吗？他能飞吗？”我又问道。

“他的两只翅膀都被绑住了。”他回答说。

这让我惊骇不已。我说：“噢，你这骆驼的兄弟、驴子的表亲，你不应该跑到这里，而应该到你自己家附近去找找他。你没有看出他想设法飞走，但既然他的翅膀被绑住，他是不是从房顶掉下去了呢？到如今，他已经被某只猫杀死吞吃了。噢，这是对鸽子的一种屠杀。你已经剥夺了人类信鸽的王冠！你已经谋杀了鸽子的荣耀！”我这样责备他。

我的话完全把那个人吓坏了，他恳求我跟他一起去寻找彩虹鸽。我的第一个想法就是要从猫那里救出这个可怜的家伙。我们寻找了整整一个下午，但白忙了一场。我在十二个小时内仔细查看了更多的肮脏小巷，盼望能赶在某只脏猫之前，找到陷入绝境的彩虹鸽，这比我下半辈子走过的小巷都要多。唉，我们还是没有找到他。那天夜里，我回家很晚，为此遭到一番严厉的责骂，极其伤心地上床睡觉了。

妈妈理解我的心情，不希望我带着受伤和激动的心情进入梦乡。她说：“你的鸽子是安全的，平心静气地去睡吧。”

“为什么，妈妈？”

她回答说：“要是你平静，你的平静思想就会帮助你。要是你平心静气，你的平静就会使他平静。要是他平静，他的思想就会良好运转。我的宝贝，你知道，彩虹鸽的思想是多么敏锐。要是他心神稳定开始行动，他就会克服所有的障碍，平安到家。现在让我们向大慈大悲的神祈祷吧，让我们自己平静下来。”于是，我们在寂静夜晚的团团包围下静静地坐了半个小时，说：“我是平静的。愿一切存在的东西都平静。平静，平静，愿平静降临万物！OmShanti[1]，shanti，shanti!”

当我准备睡觉的时候，妈妈说：“你现在绝不会再做噩梦了。因为神的平和与怜悯在你心中照亮，所以你夜里会得到充分的休息。平和！”

毫无疑问，我最终得到了充分的休息。因为第二天上午十一点左右，彩虹鸽就飞起，掠过了天空。他飞得很高。他是如何让翅膀得到解放，我不得不让他用自己的语言告诉你们。让我们再次使用幻想的语法和想象的词典吧。

“噢，精通多种语言的主人啊，”彩虹鸽在我们自己的房顶开口说道，“我在那个新主人的家里一天也受不了了！他给我被虫子污染过的谷粒吃，让我喝不新鲜的水。毕竟，我是一个生灵，我为什么要被当成石头或碎片对待？此外，他用臭烘烘的渔具绑住我的翅膀。我会跟这种人待在一起吗？绝不会！所以，他刚把我放在他的白色房顶下了楼，我就拍打着翅膀飞走了。唉！我的翅膀沉甸甸的，飞起来让我疼痛难忍。于是，我就落在了附近小巷的一家商店的遮阳篷上面。我坐在那里等待，盼望着救援。我看到几只雨燕飞过，我对他们呼喊，但他们不是我的朋友。我看到一只野鸽，我呼喊，但他也没有任何反应。正在这时，我看到一只黑猫向我走来。死亡向这里走来，越来越近，黄玉色的眼睛红光闪闪。黑猫蹲伏下来，准备纵身跃起。我也纵身跃起——飞过了他的头顶，飞到了遮阳篷上方大约五英尺的飞檐上，一只雨燕曾在那里筑巢。尽管极其艰难，但我还是紧紧地抓住了那个地方，直到那只黑猫销声匿迹。这时候，我又纵身飞起。我上方四五英尺就是房顶。我落到了那里。但是，我的一只翅膀受伤了。为了减轻痛苦，我按摩起了翅膀的根部。我用嘴一根一根地挤压和揉搓羽毛，然后什么东西就滑了下来。我已经成功地把一根小羽毛从渔具的束缚中挣脱了出来。渔具臭烘烘的，恶心死了。我接着揉搓和挤压下一根羽毛，瞧，第二根羽毛也自由了。噢，这是一种多么好的感觉啊！很快，整个翅膀都自由了。就在这时，那只黑猫再次出现在了房顶上，但现在我能飞出大约十英尺，于是就飞到了一座高层建筑的飞檐上面，在那里找到了一个便利的栖息地。我从那里望着那只致命的黑猫，只见他蹲伏下来，然后纵身扑向刚从我的翅膀上脱落的渔具。这向我阐明了一个新的体验：吸引那只猫的是这条臭烘烘的钓鱼线，而不是我。我立即开始啄捆绑我另一只翅膀的细线，才解脱一半翅膀，夜幕就降临了，当我终于摆脱翅膀上最后一个臭烘烘的绳索的羁绊的时候，我不得不等到天亮再飞回家，因为猫头鹰会在黎明时分飞行，隼来得晚些，我希望空中有一条安全通道。现在，我终于到家了——我又饿又渴。”

我对新来的鸽子做的第一件事，就是喂他们食物和新鲜的水。我从来不让他们喝他们洗过澡的水。因为彩虹鸽的翅膀上有一股鱼腥味，所以我把他和其他鸽子分开，给了他单独的住处。花费了三天之久，洗了三次痛快的澡之后，彩虹鸽才又适合文明社会。让我顺便说一下，我的父亲让我把钱退给那个买彩虹鸽的人，因为这种结果可悲可叹。实话告诉你，我当时不想那样做。但是，现在感到听从父亲的话是对的。两个星期后，在解开新买的那些鸽子的翅膀之前，我收买那些鸽子，让他们喜欢我。每天早晨，我都会把一些谷粒和花生泡在酥油（清牛油）里。谷粒和花生在酥油里泡一整天之后，我就给每只爱鸽各喂十几粒。他们非常喜欢那些美食，不到两天时间就已经形成了一个习惯，每天下午五点钟之前飞到我身边，讨要酥油美食。又过了三天，我细致入微地解开他们的翅膀，在四点四十五之前解开他们。他们一感觉到自由，就全都飞走了。但是，你瞧，在发现他们获得自由最初的欢欣过后，他们又飞落到了房顶上，要酥油花生和谷粒吃！尽管我们不得不通过喂饱鸽子来赢得他们的信任是一种遗憾，但可叹的是，我已经注意到有许多男男女女在这方面类似鸽子！

第二章　战前训练（续）


随着一天天过去，这些新鸽子渐渐地学会了飞得离家越来越远。一个月后，他们被带到了五十英里以外的地方放飞，除了两只显然逃回了旧主人家之外，所有的鸽子都在彩虹鸽的带领下飞回了我的身边。

要想毫无争议地成为领导，这不是一个容易解决的问题。事实上，彩虹鸽和两只新公鸽——希拉和嘉豪——之间必须进行一场激烈的战斗。最后被命名为嘉豪的鸽子是一只纯黑色的筋斗鸽。他的羽毛像猎豹的皮毛一样闪亮。他温和而不凶猛，但他拒绝接受彩虹鸽领导整个鸽群。你知道信鸽通常都是多么喜欢吵架和炫耀。所有的公鸽都常常昂首阔步地走在我家的房顶上，咕咕叫着，交谈着，好像他们各自都是检阅一切的君主。要是彩虹鸽认为自己是拿破仑，白色信鸽希拉（钻石）——用诗意的语言表达，就是像“阳光核心”一样白——认为自己是亚历山大大帝，而嘉豪（黑钻石）——尽管不是一只信鸽——也想让大家知道他是尤里乌斯·恺撒和福煦[1]元帅的化身。除了那三只鸽子之外，还有其他自以为是的公鸽，但他们已经被上面三只公鸽中的某一只打败了。如今，有必要通过决斗确定整个鸽群的领导者。





有一天，我看到希拉一边梳理翅膀，一边在嘉豪太太面前胡说八道。嘉豪太太是一只漂亮的墨黑色鸽子，眼睛像鸡血石一般红。当嘉豪不知从哪里飞过来，扑在希拉身上时，问题就快要解决了。希拉感到愤怒极了，就像恶魔一样搏斗起来。他们嘴咬脚踢，翅膀相互拍打。所有其他鸽子都从这两只公鸽角斗的那个圈子逃走了。彩虹鸽站在那里旁观，好似网球比赛时的裁判似的。最后，经过五六个回合的缠斗，希拉获胜。他带着自负到极点的神气走到嘉豪太太身边，好像在说：“夫人，你的丈夫是一个胆小鬼，看到我多么出色了吧。咕咕，咕咕，咕咕。”她极其轻蔑地看了他一眼，扑动着翅膀退回到他们家里丈夫的身边。这下轮到希拉一副垂头丧气、闷闷不乐的样子；随后，他突然大发雷霆，竭尽全力扑向彩虹鸽。彩虹鸽没有防备，一受到愤怒的袭击，就差点儿被击倒。希拉又是啄又是扑打，彩虹鸽感到头昏眼花，站都站不起来了，于是就飞走了，希拉这个疯狂的家伙紧追不舍。他们绕圈飞行，就像两只陀螺在旋转一样。我几乎看不清究竟是哪一个在追哪一个。他们飞的速度很快，我都看不清他们是何时停下来，开始相互啄咬和扑击的。翅膀拍击的啪啪声带着一种不祥的喧闹声弥漫在空中。此刻，羽毛开始四处飞舞。突然，两只鸽子嘴啄爪抓，一边搏斗，一边飞转到地上——两只鸟成了愤怒的化身。彩虹鸽看到用这种方式决不出胜负，就挣脱对方的魔爪，飞到了空中。希拉飞快地拍打着翅膀，紧追不舍。在距离地面三英尺左右，彩虹鸽伸出利爪，扼住希拉的气管，开始越抓越紧，同时继续像钢枷一样奋力拍打翅膀，对手身上的羽毛雪片般飞落下来。此时，在那种暴风雪般纷纷扬扬的羽毛中，两只鸟翻滚到了地上，像两条疯狂的巨蛇一样恶毒地啄着对方。最后，希拉松开，犹如一朵被撕烂的白花枯萎在地上。他的一条腿已经脱臼了。至于彩虹鸽，他的喉咙和脖子几乎没有剩下任何羽毛。但是，彩虹鸽非常高兴，不管怎样，决出了胜负。他完全明白，要是希拉一开始没有浪费一半力气跟嘉豪搏斗，他，彩虹鸽说不定赢不了这场战斗。不过，结果好就是好。我给希拉的腿绑上了绷带，采取了一切必需的措施。在接下来的三十分钟里，所有鸽子都在吃今天最后一顿饭，完全忘记了最近发生过的一切。鸽子的血液里根本没有愠怒和怨恨——毫无疑问，他们都来自良好的家族！即使最小的身躯，也有良好的教养，不用说，希拉像绅士一样接受了失败。

如今，一月份已经来临了，天气凉爽，天空晴朗，鸽子大赛开始了。每个人的鸽群都要经受三点考验，也就是团队合作、长途飞行和危险下的飞行。我们赢得了团队合作的一等奖，但我遗憾地说，由于一场悲伤的不幸事故——你会在适当的时候了解到这一点——我的鸽群不可能赢得其他两项。

这就是团队合作的特性。不同的鸽群一路飞离他们各自的家。一旦远离口哨和表明主人声音的其他响声，不同的鸽群就会合并在一起，随后不约而同地，在他们认为合适的鸽子的领导下飞行。所有这一切都发生在空中，鸽子的智慧和鸽子的本能在那里占据上风，那只飞在前面、获准领航的鸽子就是这样做的，尽管他从来不清楚自己被授予这个荣誉的原因。

气温下降到了四十五度[2]。对印度我们这一地区来说，这是一个晴朗而寒冷的早晨，事实上是一年中最寒冷的一天。像往常的冬天一样，天空晴朗无云，辽阔高远，像蓝宝石一般纯净。城市房屋——玫瑰色、蓝色、白色和黄色——看上去就像一队巨人从黎明的多彩深渊里冉冉升起。在远处，地平线闪耀在暗褐色和紫色的雾霭当中。穿着琥珀色和紫水晶色长袍的男男女女对神晨祷过后，从房顶上举起双臂，向冉冉升起的太阳祈福。城市的喧嚣和气味被从黑夜的狗窝里释放出来。鸢[3]和乌鸦的叫声弥漫在空中。越过喧嚣和吵闹声，人们还能听到长笛声。此刻，信号哨响起，比赛已经开始了。每位鸽迷都在自家的房顶上挥舞一面白旗。立刻，不知从何处而来的无数鸽群飞向了天空。鸽群一群接一群，色彩缤纷，扑打着翅膀，飞到了城市上空。在成千上万的信鸽和筋斗鸽雷鸣般的急流面前，乌鸦和鸢——有红色和褐色两种——逃离了天空。很快，所有的鸽群在空中盘旋，每一群都呈扇形飞行，就像许许多多的云朵被吸进空中的大旋涡似的。尽管每时每刻他们都越飞越高，但很长时间每个鸽群的主人都能从鸽群中认出自己的鸽子，即使最后那些分开的鸽群合为一体，像一堵翅膀围成的实体墙一样飞行，我也能根据他们不一般的姿势辨认出彩虹鸽、希拉、嘉豪和其他六只鸽子。每只鸽子飞行的时候都有能成为其记号的个性特征。无论哪位主人希望引起他的鸽群中的任何一只鸽子注意，他都会吹起带有某种停顿的尖利的口哨，作为信号。只要听到口哨，鸽子就会注意。

最后，整个鸽群飞得极高，就连鸽迷们发出的哨子声也到不了那样的高度。此时，他们在空中停止盘旋，开始向地平线飞去。争夺领导权的比赛已经开始了。当鸽子们在天空的各个方向飞来飞去的时候，为了确定鸽子们对哪一只鸽子领飞放心，我们这些站在下面的鸽群主人不得不聚精会神地抬头仰望。一时间，看上去好像我的嘉豪会领飞。但是，他刚飞到鸽群前面，他们全都转向了右边。这引起了队伍的一阵混乱，就像赛马场上的马一样，所有的不明身份的鸽子都向前冲去。然而，这些鸽子一一被其他鸽子甩在了身后。这种情况频繁发生，我们开始对比赛失去了兴趣。看样子好像某只没有特色的鸽子会赢得梦寐以求的领导地位。

突然，许多房顶上的鸽迷们都叫喊起来：“彩虹鸽，彩虹鸽，彩虹鸽！”是的，许多鸽迷都在叫喊那个名字。现在，我可以看到了——没有丝毫错误——是我的彩虹鸽飞在庞大鸽群的前面——引领鸽群飞行。噢，多么辉煌的时刻啊！彩虹鸽带领鸽群从天边飞向另一边，每次都飞高几英尺。到早上八点钟，天空的任何一个角落都看不到一只鸽子。这时候，我们收起自己的旗子，下楼去学习自己的功课。到了中午，当我们又一次上楼的时候，每个人都能看到整堵墙一样的鸽群正在下落。看哪！彩虹鸽还在领航。“彩虹鸽，彩虹鸽！”的喊声再次响起。是的，彩虹鸽已经赢得了棕榈枝，因为他保持了四个多小时的领导地位。他下落时像起飞时一样——都独领风骚！

现在到了飞行比赛最危险的时刻。庞大鸽群的领队发出了解散的命令，一群接一群的鸽子飞离主队，各个分开的鸽群向自己的家飞去。但是，不会太快。在其他鸽子飞向家的时候，一些鸽子必须在上方保护他们。彩虹鸽把我的一小群鸽子排成伞形，保护属于其他竞争者的正在退后的鸽子。这就是争夺领导地位付出的代价——也就是自我牺牲的另一个名称。

就在这时，一件可怕到极点的事情发生了。印度冬季，一种名叫巴兹的秃鹰会来到南方。巴兹不吃腐肉，像鹰和隼一样，巴兹通常吃用自己的利爪杀死的猎物。他们卑鄙狡猾——我想他们是一类出身低微的鹰——尽管翅膀末端没有散开，但他们跟鸢相似，会成对微微飞在鸢群的上方，躲开猎物，这样既能看到猎物，又不会让猎物看到自己。

在那个特别的日子，就在彩虹鸽赢得首领桂冠时，我察觉到一对巴兹跟一群鸢飞了过来。我立刻把手指放在嘴上，吹出一声尖锐的口哨。彩虹鸽明白了我的信号，重新分配追随者，呈月牙形散开飞行，自己飞在中间，吩咐嘉豪和希拉掩护两侧。整个团队团结一致，犹如一只巨鸟。随后，他们开始越来越快地下降。到目前为止，他们在空中飞行的任务已经完成了。早上跟他们一起比赛的所有其他鸽群都已经回家了。

看到鸽群下降如此迅速，一只巴兹就像从喜马拉雅悬崖上滚落的一块石头似的落到了他们前面。就在降落到跟我的鸽群同等高度的时候，巴兹张开翅膀，面向鸽群。这并不是什么新战略，因为过去每只巴兹都使用过这种方法，以便引起鸽群的恐慌。不可否认，这十有八九都会成功，因为这样的话，吓坏的鸽子就会团结不起来，胡乱飞向各个方向。毫无疑问，这就是巴兹现在希望的结果，但是，我们老谋深算的彩虹鸽拍打着翅膀，率领整个鸽群从敌人下面大约五英尺的地方毫不战栗地飞了过去。他这样做，是知道敌人从来不会攻击一个紧密团结的团体。但他刚向前飞了一百英尺，第二只巴兹——可能是巴兹太太——降落在了鸽群前面，像她的丈夫那样张开了翅膀。但是，彩虹鸽根本没有在意，领着整个鸽群直接向她飞去。这是不可思议的。以前从来没有鸽子敢这样做，巴兹太太逃离了鸽子们的攻击。她刚转过身，彩虹鸽和其他鸽子就尽可能快地下降俯冲。到如今，他们距离我们的房顶几乎不到六百英尺了。就在这时，就像命中注定一样，巴兹先生像一颗装满烈性炸药的炮弹一样又扑下来，这次正好落在了月牙形队伍的中央，像火叉似的张开翅膀和嘴巴，愤怒地尖叫着。这起到了作用。鸽群不再像一堵实体墙，而是被一分为二，一半追随彩虹鸽，一半可怜巴巴、恐惧万分，不知道飞向哪里。彩虹鸽像真正的领导在重大危机时做的那样。他跟随那个惊慌失措的鸽群，直至赶上鸽群，瞧！他们又一次及时地融为一体。几乎与此同时，巴兹太太又如霹雳一般飞落到了彩虹鸽和其他鸽子中间，她几乎落到了彩虹鸽的尾巴上，把彩虹鸽和其他鸽子隔离开来，她使他们的领导者丧失了领导权，她试图安全飞行，不理会所有的一切。这完全孤立了彩虹鸽，使他随时遭到四面攻击。彩虹鸽依然无所畏惧，尽力下飞到撤退的队伍前面。还没等他下降十二英尺，巴兹先生就俯冲到了他前面。彩虹鸽看到敌人如此接近，就变得越来越大胆，翻滚起来。这是一次幸运的行动。要是他不这样做，从后面伸出魔爪的巴兹太太就会当场抓住他。





与此同时，我的其他鸽子不断地拍打翅膀，都已经快到家了。他们纷纷落向房顶，就像成熟的果实从树上落下似的。但是，他们当中并不是每只鸽子都是胆小鬼。恰恰相反，他具有勇敢的本质，他就是黑钻石嘉豪。当整个鸽群降落在房顶上的时候，他翻了个筋斗飞得更高。他的意图没有任何错误。他要支援彩虹鸽。看到彩虹鸽又翻筋斗，巴兹先生改变了主意，放弃了追逐彩虹鸽，猛地跟随嘉豪俯冲下来。嗯，你了解彩虹鸽——盘旋着，翻转着，盘绕得像闪电一样飞快，引得巴兹太太气喘吁吁地追他。她无法像彩虹鸽那样多次翻转，不，几乎不能翻转那么多次。但是，巴兹先生经验丰富，不断地飞到高处瞄准目标，这把嘉豪置于危险的境地。嘉豪要再绕错一个弯，巴兹先生就会抓住他。哎呀！可怜的鸟儿，他做了不应该做的事情。他在巴兹先生的下方直线飞行，巴兹先生马上收拢翅膀，闪电般落下来。听不到任何声响，就连“声音的影子”都没有。下坠，下坠，下坠，他像死神一样落下。接着，最可怕的事情发生了。为了救嘉豪、挫败敌人，没有人知道彩虹鸽是怎么滑到了巴兹先生和嘉豪之间的。唉！巴兹没有放弃攻击，而是飞快地伸出利爪，有些不稳地抓住了这个入侵者。羽毛像阵雨一般飘满空中。你几乎能看到彩虹鸽的身体在敌人的掌控中翻滚。就像烙铁穿过我的身体一样，我为我的鸟儿痛苦地尖叫！但是，无济于事。巴兹一圈又一圈，带着猎物越飞越高，尽力用利爪把猎物抓得更稳。我必须承认这里发生了最丢脸的事情。我一心想救彩虹鸽，没有注意到巴兹太太落下来抓住了嘉豪。那一定发生得飞快，就在彩虹鸽被抓走之后。这时候，空中飘满了嘉豪的羽毛。敌人用爪子紧紧地抓住他，嘉豪没有动一下，以使自己挣脱开来。但是，彩虹鸽不是这样，他仍然在巴兹先生的魔爪下扭动着。好像是为了帮助丈夫把猎物抓得更稳，巴兹太太飞近丈夫。就在此时，嘉豪挣扎着想获得自由。他那样摇晃使巴兹太太的翅膀跟她丈夫的翅膀撞在了一起。那家伙失去了平衡。他差点儿在空中倒转过来，随着羽毛又一次阵雨般飘落，彩虹鸽猛地挣脱了敌人的魔爪。现在，他降落，降落，降落……三十秒钟后，一只气喘吁吁、血迹斑斑的鸽子落在了我们的房顶上。我把他举起来，以便仔细检查他的伤口。他身体的两侧被撕裂，但不是非常严重。我马上把他送到了鸽子医生那里，医生给他包扎了伤口。这花了大约半个小时。当我回家把彩虹鸽放进鸽巢时，哪里也找不到嘉豪。唉，他的窝巢空空荡荡。而当我走上房顶的时候，只见嘉豪的太太正站在护墙上，仔细搜索天空的每个方向，寻找丈夫的踪迹。她不仅花了那一天时间，而且以同样的方式又找了两三天时间。我不知道她是不是找到了什么安慰，因为她的丈夫为了救一个勇敢的同伴而牺牲了自己。

第三章　彩虹鸽求偶


彩虹鸽的伤口愈合得很慢。直到二月中旬左右，他仍不能飞到高于房顶十几英尺的地方。他持续飞行的时间也很短。不管我是多么频繁地把他从房顶上赶走，我都不能让他在空中停留超过十五分钟。一开始，我以为是他的肺部发生了紊乱。检查后证明他的肺部健康，我就把他不愿飞行归因于他的心脏，也许是心脏在那次事故中受到了损伤。第二次检查过后，证明这种假设也是不成立的。

于是，我完全被彩虹鸽的行为激怒了，就给刚德写了一封长信，描述了发生的所有事情。结果刚德跟一些英国人打猎去了。我一直没有获得他的帮助，就决定仔仔细细地检查彩虹鸽。我日复一日地把他放在我们的房顶上观察，但我怎么也找不到他的病因。于是，我放弃了看到彩虹鸽再次飞翔的所有希望。

大约到了二月底，我才接到刚德从丛林深处寄来的一封神秘短信，上面写道：“你的鸽子受到了惊吓。治好他的恐惧，就会使他飞翔。”但是，他没有说怎么治。我也想不出让彩虹鸽展翅一路飞上高空的任何方法。把他赶离房顶是没用的，因为要是我把他从这个角落赶走，他就会飞到另一个角落站在那里。最令人不安的是，一片云影或一群在天空飞翔的鸟的影子落在房顶他的身上，他就会吓得发抖。毫无疑问，每一片落下的阴影都会印入他的脑海，使他感觉那就是巴兹或猎鹰飞扑向他。这让我明白了，彩虹鸽受到了多么严重的打击。如何治好他的恐惧症，这真让我一筹莫展。要是我们在喜马拉雅山，我就会把他带到那位圣人那里，他曾经治好了彩虹鸽类似的疾病，但这城市里没有喇嘛。我只好等待。

三月迎来了春天，换过羽毛的彩虹鸽不同寻常，看上去像一块深邃硕大的海蓝宝石的心脏，漂亮得难以形容。有一天，我不知道怎么回事，我发现他在跟嘉豪的遗孀说话。随着春天的到来，她看上去光彩照人。在阳光下，她的黑蛋白石的肤色像热带夜空闪烁的星星。当然，我知道，她和彩虹鸽之间的婚姻尽管对后代来说不是最优的选择，但有可能使彩虹鸽战胜恐惧，也可能使嘉豪太太摆脱丧夫以来的郁闷情绪。

为了促进两只鸽子的情谊，我把他们放在一只笼子里，带给我的朋友拉迪亚。拉迪亚住在大约两百英里外的丛林边缘。他那个村子名叫加特西拉，位于河岸上，河对岸耸立着树林茂密、充满各种动物的一座座高山。拉迪亚是这个村子的祭司，他的祖先已经做了上千年的祭司，他的父母亲都住在大水泥房子里。村庙也是水泥建成的，跟他们家毗邻。村庙有高高的围墙，拉迪亚每天夜里会履行职责，给聚集到那里的农民诵经、讲经。他在屋里诵经时，屋外很远的地方会传来虎啸或穿过窄河的野象的嘶鸣。这是一个美丽而又险恶的地方。在加特西拉村，没有发生过任何危险的事，但你不用走很远，就会遇到你想找的猛兽。

我们坐的火车夜里到达加特西拉。拉迪亚和家里的两个仆人到车站迎接我们。其中一个仆人把我的包袱扛在肩上，另一个仆人提起装有两只鸽子的鸟笼。我们每个人不得不提着一盏防风灯，他们为我多带了一盏。我们成一路纵队，一个仆人在前面领路，另一个走在后面，走了一个小时。我产生了疑问，就问道：“我们为什么要绕道走？”

拉迪亚说：“春天野生动物会经过这里一路向北。我们不能走近路穿过树林。”

“胡说！”我大声嚷道。“我以前曾经走过好多次了。我们什么时候到家？”

“半小时后——”

正在这时，我们脚下的土地好像裂开似的，发出了火山爆发般可怕的响声，随后响起了“哇——嗬——嗬——嗬——哇！”的叫声。

鸟笼里的鸽子惊慌地拍着翅膀。我不由自主地用一只手抓住了拉迪亚的肩膀，但拉迪亚没有同感，而是哈哈大笑。而且——有其主必有其仆——两个仆人也笑了起来。

他们的欢笑声停息之后，拉迪亚解释说：“你已经走过好多次了，是吗？那为什么猴子受到灯笼惊吓发出的叫声让你害怕呢？”

“猴子？”我质问道。

“是的，好多猴子，”朋友提醒我说，“每年这个时候他们都一路向北去。我们刚才吓跑了头顶树上的整整一群猴子。仅此而已。以后可不要把每只猴子的叫喊当成老虎的咆哮喽。”

幸运的是，我们很快就到了家，没有再发生打扰我自满情绪的意外事件。

第二天早晨，拉迪亚到祠堂履行职责去了，我走上房顶，打开鸟笼，放飞鸽子。最初，鸽子们困惑不解，但看到我站在他们旁边，双手捧满了酥油谷粒，他们就安定下来，立刻吃起了早饭。我们那天几乎全天都在房顶上度过。我不敢把他们单独留在房顶上很久，唯恐陌生的环境让他们不安。

在随后的一个星期里，这两只鸽子在加特西拉就像在家里一样，而且相互变得格外亲热。毫无疑问，我现在把他们和鸽群隔离开来是明智之举。大约在我们逗留的第八天，我和拉迪亚都吃惊地看到彩虹鸽在求偶。母鸽持续飞行，但飞得很低。彩虹鸽尾随其后。看到彩虹鸽追赶上来，母鸽攀升、折回。彩虹鸽也如此这般在后面追随。母鸽再次攀升。但是，这次彩虹鸽突然停住，开始在母鸽下面的空中盘旋。不过，我感觉到他正在重拾信心。最后，鸽子的典范——彩虹鸽——治愈着自己的恐惧和对天空的恐惧，又一次翱翔在天空。

第二天早晨，这两只鸽子飞得越来越高，相互嬉戏。彩虹鸽又一次拒绝继续高飞，开始飞速下降，而不是在配偶下面的空中盘旋。这让我百思不解，但拉迪亚观察敏锐，解释说：“一朵像扇子一样大小的云彩遮住了太阳。阴影突然落下来，彩虹鸽以为那是他的敌人。等到云彩过去，然后就——”

拉迪亚说得没错。又过了一小会儿，太阳出来了，光线又一次从彩虹鸽的翅膀上洒落下来。他马上停止向下飞行，开始在空中盘旋起来。他的配偶原来一直向下飞，陪着他，现在也在一百英尺左右的上方等着他。此刻，彩虹鸽像出笼的鹰一样扑打着翅膀向上飞去。他突然转向不断向上飞时，阳光在他周围变成了一道道彩圈。很快，彩虹鸽不再尾随，而是带领着配偶飞行。他们就这样飞上了天空——彩虹鸽完全治好了他的恐惧，母鸽被他的敏捷和力量迷住了。





第二天早晨，他们俩很早就起飞了，飞得很远，时间很长。有一阵子，他们消失在群山那边，好像他们已经掠过了峰顶，滑到了山的另一边。他们飞走了至少一个小时。十一点左右，他们终于回来了，各自嘴里都衔着一根大稻草。他们准备筑巢孵卵。我想我应该把他们带回家，但拉迪亚坚持说我们至少应该再待一个星期。

那个星期，我们每天都穿过河流，在更加危险的丛林里度过几个小时，随身带着两只鸽子，以便在距离拉迪亚家几乎不到五英里的密林放飞。除了检验方向感和不断高飞，彩虹鸽忘记了所有的一切。换句话说，他对配偶的爱情、地点和气候的变化治好了他的恐惧——那是最可怕的疾病。

在这里，要用毫不含糊的语言铭记这一点，就是几乎我们所有的烦恼都来自恐惧、担心和憎恨。任何人只要染上这三个当中的任何一个，其他两个就会如影随形。任何猛兽都会先惊吓，再杀死猎物。事实上，只要捕食者让猎物心里产生恐惧，猎物就会死去。简而言之，还没等敌人给予最后一击，恐惧就已将其置于死地了。





第四章　战争召唤彩虹鸽


八月的第一个星期，孩子们出生后不久，希拉和彩虹鸽从加尔各答前往孟买，跟刚德一道启航，为世界大战服务。因为军队需要两只鸽子，所以我就派送了那只单身鸟希拉和彩虹鸽。

我很高兴，在彩虹鸽启航前往佛兰德斯[1]和法国战场之前，他对自己的小宝宝们有了一些了解。我高兴的主要原因就是，我知道一只既有太太又有刚出生的宝宝们在家里等待的鸽子很少不能返回。彩虹鸽和他的家庭之间那种爱的纽带使我确信，他一定会非常出色地完成送信的使命。只要他活着，任何枪声和子弹都阻挡不了他最后回到家里。

但在这里，有人可能会提出问题，就是彩虹鸽的家在加尔各答，战争在几千英里之外。这一点没错，但是，因为把自己的太太和宝宝们撇在家里，所以他会尽最大努力跟刚德一起飞回到暂时的窝巢。

据说，彩虹鸽在前线和司令部之间传递了好几份重要情报，那里的总司令和刚德在等着他。当然，彩虹鸽起先喜欢刚德，但在接下来的几个月里，他变得非常喜欢总司令。

之所以是刚德而不是我带着两只鸽子去前线，是因为我还没有成年，没有资格进行任何种类的服役，这位老人不得不带着他们。在从印度到马赛的航程中，希拉、彩虹鸽和这位老猎人成了忠实的朋友。我还从来没有见过任何奇异的动物能抗拒刚德的长久友谊，我的鸽子已经认识他很久了，很容易就会响应他。

从1914年九月到第二年春天待在佛兰德斯印度军队期间，希拉或彩虹鸽被不同的部队带往前线，刚德则带着笼子留在司令部附近。在那里，不时会有情报写在重量只有一盎司的薄纸上，绑在彩虹鸽的脚上，之后他被放飞。彩虹鸽总是飞到军队司令部附近的刚德那里。到了那里，情报被破译，得到司令官亲自回复。据说，司令官本人非常喜欢彩虹鸽，高度重视他的服役。

不过，最好还是听听彩虹鸽自己讲的故事，因为除了做梦的人者之外，谁都不能讲出一个梦的经过，所以彩虹鸽的一些冒险经历应该由他亲自叙述。

“渡过黑水——印度洋和地中海——之后，我们又坐火车穿过了一个非常奇怪的国家。尽管是九月，但那个国家——法国——还是像印度南方的冬天一样寒冷。我希望看到积雪盖顶的山脉和参天大树，因为我想我要接近喜马拉雅山了。可是，我从地平线看到的山，没有一座比我们的最高的竹林高。我不知道为什么一个国家地势不高气候却很冷。

“最后，我们到达了前线。结果是战场的后方，但即使在那里，你也能听到喷火器的隆隆声。而且，作为一只普通的鸽子，不管什么形状和大小的喷火器，我统统都见过。我不喜欢那些狂叫、喷出致命火焰的铁狗。我在那里待了两天之后，我们的试验之夜就开始了。除了我自己和希拉之外，只有我们自己城市的四只鸽子。你知道希拉可能会很鲁莽。我们刚飞到一个大村房屋的上空，希拉就飞向轰隆隆响的方向，想去侦察。好吧，不到一个小时，我们就到了那里。噢，多么吓人的声音！躲藏在树下的铁狗嘴里喷出了霹雳般的大火球，在我们下方咝咝作响，发出爆炸声。我吓得要死，就越飞越高。可是，我在最高的天空也找不到任何太平。不知从哪里飞来了大批老鹰，像吹喇叭的大象般怒吼咆哮。看到如此可怕的景象，我们向刚德等待我们的地方飞去。然而，两只老鹰尾随在后！我们越飞越快。幸运的是，它们没有追上我们。正如我们所料，那些老鹰向我们住的地方飞下来。我感觉死亡就在眼前，我觉得那些老鹰会像黄鼠狼一样等我们进了笼子就吃掉我们。然而不是这样！它们马上停止了轰鸣，突然它们降落到了地上——死了。两个人分别从那两只鸟的肚子里跳出来，走了。我不知道老鹰怎么能吃掉人类。这些人又怎么能活着走出来呢？

“很快，那些人办完事就回来了，又爬进了老鹰的肚子里。接着，随着一阵嘎吱声和喧嚣，这些老鹰又活了过来，再次飞上空中。我的心里不再疑惑，它们原来是人类的火战车。我知道这一点之后，就松了口气。

“尽管起初看上去一切都很陌生，但我们渐渐习惯之后就不再陌生了，不过，在不断的轰鸣和喧嚣下，酣睡的问题还是没有解决。在军队的那几个月里，我从来没有睡过好觉。难怪我和希拉总是紧张不安，就像刚孵出的小蛇一样。

“我的第一次冒险经历是为前线的罗塞尔达送情报，那里各种铁狗日夜狂叫和喷火。我必须给你们说一下罗塞尔达。他负责指挥来自加尔各答的许多印度战士。他把我放在笼子里，用黑帆布完全盖住，跟他的四十名战士一起出发赶往前线的战壕。经过好多个黑夜——因为我在变暗的笼子里就是这种感觉——我们到了目的地。到了那里，帆布被移开了。这时，我只能看到四周的壕沟，戴着头巾的印度士兵像小虫子一样匍匐前进。头顶飞着机械铁鹰，它们发出恐怖的轰鸣声。在这里，我开始听清了各种声音，耳朵能听到的不再是一阵阵混乱的轰隆声，而是有多种等级的爆炸声。最难分辨的就是我周围人们的交谈声。在震耳欲聋的声音里，他们的谈话听起来像是一阵懒洋洋的微风在草丛里的低语。他们不时地取下一只吼叫的铁狗——喷吐了好一阵子的火焰。随后，传来了鬣狗的笑声。几百人一起扣动那些小铁狗，发出了一阵可怕的咳嗽声——叭噗——叭噗——叭噗！那种声音又被淹没在头顶上方铁鹰低沉的鸣叫声中。铁鹰成群成群地飞过，疯狂尖叫，相互厮杀，就像许多麻雀那样。负责照看我的罗塞尔达把铁狗瞄准天空，然后射击——啪噗——喷出了一些火焰，看哪！它打下了空中的一只铁鹰，就像射中一只兔子似的。这时，传来了最低沉的声音，轰隆隆，叭隆叭！庞然大物发出了威严的虎啸，仿佛神圣和弦构成的华盖一样蔓延开来，吞没了所有其他琐碎的声音。噢，那种风琴的音调既痛苦又迷人！我能忘记吗？轰鸣一阵接着一阵，巨响一阵接着一阵，就像洪流般的巨砾相互撞击发出的喧嚣！





“为什么美好的东西总是离死亡那么近？头顶那种妙不可言、值得赞颂的神圣音乐刚攫住我的灵魂，突然一团团火球像倾盆大雨一样落在了我们周围。人们纷纷倒下，像洞里灌满洪水的老鼠一样死去。罗塞尔达血淋淋的，在一张纸上奋笔疾书，把纸条绑在我的腿上，打开笼子，把我放飞。通过他的眼神，我知道他处在可怕的危难之中，想要刚德来救助他。

“我的主人，你肯定知道我飞了起来，然而，我看到的情景几乎使我的翅膀僵硬。战壕上方的空中就像一条飞火毯一样。如何飞到飞火毯上方，成了我的难题。我用尾羽调整各个飞行方向，可是，无论我飞到哪个方向，我上方都飞蹿着上百万的火舌，正在生命的织布机上编织着毁灭的红衣。我不得不飞起来，我彩虹鸽可是父亲的骄傲。很快，我撞上了一个充满气流的气囊，这股气流吸住我，带我旋转而上，我的一只翅膀好像被折断了，我像树叶一样轻飘飘的。气流使我时上时下，直到我奋力穿过不断编织、速度越来越快的火网。但现在，我不再去看任何东西了。‘飞到刚德身边，飞到刚德身边。’我一直对自己说。每这样说一次，就像新鲜的力量注进我的心灵，使我付出最大的努力。我已经飞得很高，就进行观察，向西飞去。就在这时，一颗子弹嗖的一声掠过，打断了我的尾羽。我的半个尾巴燃烧着，从我的身上掉落。你知道这使我很愤怒！尾巴是我的荣耀。我受不了有人碰它，更不要说向它射击了。好了，我安全飞到了家，但就在我准备降落的时候，两只铁鹰在我的上方开始搏击。我没有听到它们的轰鸣，也没有看到它们的面目，要是它们相互厮杀，我不会在意，但它们在我后面射出了飓风般的火焰。它们越战斗，嘴里喷出的火就越多，我尽力俯冲闪避。要是那里有些树木就好了。当然，尽管那里有过树木，但大多数树都被射断，露出树桩，没有遮阴的舒适树叶或巨大树枝。所以，我只能曲线飞行，就像逃离丛林的大象一样，绕过那些破烂不堪的树桩。终于，我回到了家，落在了刚德的手腕上。刚德割断细线，把我身上的情报送给司令官。看上去司令官像一颗熟樱桃似的，身上散发出一种香喷喷的肥皂味。很可能，他和大多数士兵不一样，他一天都要洗三四次澡，用肥皂把自己洗干净。看完罗塞尔达写在那张纸上的话后，他拍了拍我的脑袋，像一头快乐的牛一样哼哼着。”

第五章　第二次冒险


“罗塞尔达轻伤痊愈之后，我们又被带到了前线。这一次，他带上了我和希拉。我马上明白我们要送的情报肯定至关重要，必须得托付给两只鸽子，以便至少有一只能成功。

“天气非常寒冷，我感觉就像生活在冰天雪地一样。雨一直下着，地面泥泞不堪，每次踩上去，就会陷入像流沙似的烂泥里，双脚冰冷，仿佛踩在了一具尸体上面。

“我们来到了一个陌生的地方，那不是战壕，而是一个小村子。村子周围是射击和爆炸产生的毁灭性的滚滚热浪。从人们脸上的表情可以看出来，这是一个重要的十分神圣的地方，因为尽管死亡的火舌几乎舔舐着这个地方的每个房顶、每堵墙和每棵树，但他们却不想放弃。我非常高兴能待在一片空地上，可以看到灰色天空低垂着，噢，垂得非常非常低。人们可以看到还没有炮弹落下的地方白霜斑驳的地面。即使在那里，在那个炮火密集的中心，房屋像暴风雨中的鸟巢一样纷纷倒塌，田鼠从这个洞窜向那个洞，家鼠偷吃奶酪，蜘蛛织网捕蝇，继续经营自己的生活，好像人类之间的屠杀就像覆盖天空的云彩一样微不足道。

“过了一会儿，轰炸声停止了，看上去村子——也就是留下的残垣断壁——不会再遭到袭击。天越来越暗，天空低得我可以把嘴伸进里面，湿冷攫住了我身体上的每一根羽毛，可以说就像开始拔我的毛一般。我发现我们在笼子里完全安坐不了了。我和希拉相互紧贴在一起，以便取暖。





“又一轮炮火突然开始了，这次来自四面八方，我们的小村成了一座被敌人团团包围的孤岛。显然，在包围一切的浓雾掩护下，敌人已经切断了我们跟后方的联系。随后，他们开始发射冲天火箭。尽管刚过正午，但天就像喜马拉雅的夜晚一样黑暗湿冷。我纳闷人们是怎么知道这根本不是夜晚的，毕竟，人类没有鸟类知道得多。

“我和希拉被放开了，带上了各自的情报，飞了起来，但没有飞多远，因为我们在很短的时间内就被一片浓雾吞没了，眼睛什么也看不见。一层寒冷黏湿的薄雾逼向我们，但我已经预料到了这种情况。无论是在战场上还是在印度，这种情况下我都会竭尽全力。我向上飞去，好像每一次都飞不到一英尺远，我的翅膀湿漉漉的。我长时间打喷嚏，呼吸困难，我想我会立刻倒地身亡。感谢鸽神，我现在可以看到几英尺远了！于是，我飞得更高。此刻，我的眼睛开始刺痛。突然，我意识到，我要是不想让自己失明的话，就必须拉下薄膜——我在飞过沙尘暴时使用的第二层眼睑，因为我们不是在浓雾里——这是人类释放的一种难闻且毁眼的烟雾。我的眼睛生疼，就像有人用大头针扎似的。薄膜此刻盖住了我的眼睛，我屏住呼吸，奋力向上飞，陪伴着我的希拉也向上飞。他快要被这种气体闷死了，可是，他不会放弃飞行。最后，我们终于飞离了那片毒雾，这里的空气纯净。当我收起眼上的第二层眼睑的时候，我看到我们的队伍在遥远的灰色天际。于是，我们向队伍飞去。

“我们朝家的方向刚飞到一半，突然一只浑身带着黑色十字架的可怕铁鹰越飞越近，冲我们喷火——啪噗，啪噗，噗啪……我们俯冲闪避，尽我们所能飞到了铁鹰后面。在那里，铁鹰打不中我们。想象一下我们在铁鹰屁股上方飞行的情景。它无可奈何，开始兜圈，我们也兜圈。它翻起了筋斗，我们也翻起了筋斗。铁鹰摆动不了尾巴，什么也做不了，跟真鹰的尾巴不一样，铁鹰的尾巴像死鱼一样僵硬。我们知道，要是我们再次出现在它前面，我们就会立即被射死。

“时间在流逝，我意识到，我们不能一直继续留在这铁鹰尾巴后方。我们撇在身后毒气弥漫的村子困住了罗塞尔达和我们的朋友们。我们必须把情报送出去，以便营救他们到达安全地带。

“正在这时，那只铁鹰玩了个花招，掉头飞回自己的营地。我们不希望尾随它飞进敌人的阵地，被神枪手狙击。我们正在飞往自己家的途中，看到了阵地，不再小心翼翼；我们避开铁鹰，以最快的速度飞行，每拍几下翅膀，就飞得更高。我们一这样做，那个卑鄙的畜生就掉头跟来。幸运的是，这花费了它一点时间。现在毫无疑问我们正飞行在自己的阵地上空。同样，铁鹰升到了跟我们水平的高度，继续向我们喷火——噗，噗，乓，啪！此刻，我们不得不闪避俯冲。我让希拉飞在我的下方，这样可以保护他。我们就这样飞着，但命运就是命运，不知从哪里飞来一只铁鹰，向敌人开火。我们现在感觉平安无事了，我和希拉彼此并肩飞行。就在这时，一颗子弹嗖地跟我擦身而过，打断了希拉的两只翅膀。可怜又受伤的希拉！他盘旋着，像一片银叶一样落下，幸好落在了我们的阵地上。看到希拉死去，我以闪电般的速度飞行，再也没有回头去看那两只铁鹰的决斗。





“回到家后，我被带到了司令官那里，他轻轻地拍了拍我的背。随后，我第一次意识到我送的是多么重要的情报，因为那位老人一看完那张纸就触摸了一下嘀嗒作响的怪东西。他拿起了一只喇叭，对着喇叭吼叫。如今，刚德把我带到了我的窝巢。到了那里，当我栖息在那里想着希拉的时候，我感觉下面的土地颤抖起来。铁鹰密如蝗虫般飞在空中，咆哮、轰鸣和尖叫，下面的地上数不清的铁狗轰隆作响。接着，传来了这些喷出巨大火团的铁狗发出的低沉怒号，就像整个森林里的老虎发了疯一般。刚德拍了拍我的脑袋，说：‘你挽救了大局。’不过，你看到的绝不是白天，那是一片阴沉的灰色天空，它的下面死亡像龙一样盘绕、尖叫，用魔爪压碎了所有的一切。你可以猜到这是多么糟糕：第二天早晨，当我在我们的基地附近练习飞行的时候，我发现距离我的巢穴几乎不到一英里的地方，地面都被炮弹犁成了沟，就连家鼠和田鼠也都没有逃脱，其中几十只都被屠杀，炸成了碎片。噢！这非常可怕。我郁郁寡欢。希拉死了，我孤孤单单，厌烦极了！”





第六章　刚德去侦察


大约是十二月的第一个星期，刚德和彩虹鸽要独自进行一次现场勘探。他们去的地方是距离伊普尔[1]、阿尔芒蒂耶尔[2]和阿兹布鲁克[3]不远的森林。要是你有一张法国地图，从加来[4]向南画一条直线，你就会无意中发现英国和印度军队驻扎的一系列地方。阿尔芒蒂耶尔附近有许多印度伊斯兰士兵的坟墓。之所以没有印度教士兵的坟墓，是因为自古以来印度教都实行火葬，那些火化的尸体不占用任何坟墓，骨灰随风而逝，没有标记地点，也不用背负记忆。

还是要回到刚德和彩虹鸽身上。他们被派到阿兹布鲁克附近位于敌人阵地后面的一片森林，寻找一个巨大的临时地下军火库的准确位置。要是找到，刚德和彩虹鸽——无论是单个还是一起——就要带着一份准确的地图返回英军司令部。这就是所有的任务。于是，十二月一个晴朗的早晨，彩虹鸽被带上了一架飞机。飞机在森林上空飞行了大约二十英里。这片森林一部分被印度军队占领，一部分由德国军队占领。他们飞过德军阵地之后，彩虹鸽被放飞了。彩虹鸽飞过了整个树林，对地形有了一些了解，又飞了回来。这样做是确保彩虹鸽了解航线，对期望他完成的任务略知一二。

那天下午四点左右，太阳落山后，这个纬度比纽约靠北十度，穿得最暖和的刚德把彩虹鸽揣在大衣下面出发了。他们乘坐一辆救护车，一直到了大森林里印度军队的第二条防线。在一片漆黑中，他们在情报人员的引导下继续前进，来到了前线。

不久，他们来到了所谓的无人地带，但幸运的是，这里被树木覆盖，且大部分还没有被炮火毁灭。刚德既不懂法语，也不懂德语，英语知识仅限于三个词：“是”“不是”和“很好”，现在要留下来找到德国军队在森林里的临时军火库，伴随他的只有大衣下面的一只熟睡的鸽子。

首先，刚德不得不提醒自己，他现在在一个像喜马拉雅山寒冷气候的国家。冬天，这里的树木光秃秃的，地上落满了干枯的秋天的落叶和白霜。因为大树上或小树上的叶子寥寥无几，所以隐藏自己并非易事。夜晚漆黑，像尸体一样冰冷，但刚德在黑暗中比任何活着的人看得更清楚，他的嗅觉像最灵敏的动物那样灵敏，他知道如何在无人地带调整航向。幸运的是，那天夜里风是从东边吹来的。

刚德尽可能贴着树干前进。他的鼻子告诉他，在他们到达几分钟前，一连德国士兵正在经过。刚德像猎豹一样爬上树，等待着。他们连一丝风声都听不到。要是白天，德国兵就会发现他，因为他走在霜冻的地面上，赤脚流着血，身后会留下一串串明显的脚印。

有一次，刚德侥幸脱险，当他爬上一棵树坐在树枝上，让两个德国哨兵从他下面走过去的时候，他听到有人从一个树枝上对他耳语。他马上明白这是一名德军狙击手，但是，他只低着头倾听。这个德国兵说：“Gutennacht[5]。”然后跨过去，从树上溜了下来。毫无疑问，他把刚德看成了一名过来换岗的战友。过了一会儿，刚德下到地上，跟着那个德国兵的脚印。尽管天黑，但他的赤脚能感觉到那里的地面被人脚踩来踩去。对他来说，这不是什么难事。

最后，他到达了一个许多人露营的地方，他必须轻轻地绕过他们，继续奋力向前。这时候，他听到脚边传来一种奇怪的声音，他停下来，侧耳倾听。没错，这是一种熟悉的声音！他等待着。是动物的脚步声，啪嗒，啪嗒，啪嗒嗒！刚德向那个声音走去，接着传来了一声压抑的低吼。他没有害怕，心里反而充满了快乐。他曾经在老虎大批出没的印度丛林里过夜，不会被一条野狗的低吠吓倒。很快，两只红眼迎向刚德的目光。刚德站在那里，仔细地嗅了嗅他面前的空气，瞧！他从那条狗身上嗅不到一丁点的人味；那只动物已经发疯了。那条狗也嗅了嗅空气，想弄清他面对的是什么动物。因为刚德没有散发出一般人那种恐惧的气味，所以这条狗走上前，在他身上蹭了蹭，用力嗅着。幸运的是，刚德把彩虹鸽放在了狗鼻子的上方，而鸟儿的气味被风吹走了。于是，这条野狗感觉面前这个人只不过是一个友好而又大胆的家伙。他摇了摇尾巴，发出了呜呜声。刚德没有用手轻轻地拍他的脑袋，而是慢慢地把一只手放在狗的眼前，让他去看和嗅。接下来他担心了一会儿。狗会咬他的手吗？又过了一会儿。然后……这条狗舔了舔他的手，高兴地发出了呜呜声。刚德自言自语说：“这么说，这条猎狗没有主人，也许他的主人死了。可怜的狗已经变得像狼一样狂野。他是以抢夺德军的食品供给为生，因为显然他还没有吃过任何人肉。那就更好了。”





刚德轻轻地吹了一声口哨，这是任何一个国家所有年龄段的猎手的呼唤，意思是“带路”。那条狗就带起了路，他像公鹿溜过虎穴一样灵巧地绕过德军士兵的露营地。经过几个小时的漫游之后，他们到达了目的地。毫无疑问，刚德不仅找到了军需品仓库，而且找到了德军的食品供应站。他的向导——那条野狗——钻过了地里的一个秘密洞口，随后，过了半个小时，嘴里叼着一只大大的小牛腿又出现了。根据气味，刚德能分辨出这是牛肉。狗坐下来，趴在结霜的地面上吃起了美餐，这时候刚德穿上了靴子——他整夜都把这双靴子挎在肩上——然后抬头观察。根据星星的位置，他能说出自己在什么地方。他在那里等了一段时间。

天开始慢慢地亮了，他从口袋里掏出一个指南针。是的，他完全确信他可以画下一张地形图。就在这时，狗跳起来，用牙齿一下子咬住了刚德的大衣。刚德脑海里毫无疑问，他明白这只狗想带着他继续前行。狗跑在前面，刚德快步跟上。很快，他们就到达了一个荆棘丛生的地方，那里冰冻的藤蔓缠绕着，中间有一条只能容下一只动物的通道。野狗从许多荆棘下爬过去，就不见了踪影。

这时候，刚德画出了星星位置图和准确的地形图，然后把这两张图系在彩虹鸽的脚上，放飞了他。他望着彩虹鸽从一棵树飞到另一棵树上，在每棵树上都栖息一分钟左右，用嘴整理一下翅膀，随后用嘴理理系在脚上的情报——大概他是在确定是不是安全地系在那里——飞到了最高的树梢上，坐在那里侦察地形。那个时刻，刚德正抬头，感觉有什么东西在拽他。他低头看着自己的双脚，只见那条野狗正在拽着他走到荆棘下面的一个洞口。刚德低下身，低得足以遵循向导的指示，但正在这时，他听到头顶翅膀的拍动声，然后又听到步枪的嗒嗒声。他不想站起来去看彩虹鸽是不是已被杀害。他趴在荆棘下面，直到感觉肚子粘住脊椎，两者紧紧地贴在了地上。他向前努力爬行，突然滑下来，下落了大约八英尺，掉进了一个黑洞里。洞里一片漆黑，但刚德起初几乎没有注意到这一点，因为他正忙着揉自己擦伤的头。

他想设法弄清他在哪里，终于辨认出他一定是坐在一片结冰的水坑上面，这就像是贼窝似的，上面覆盖着密不透风的荆棘丛。即使冬天头顶没有叶子包裹树枝和藤蔓的时候，那里的白天也是一片漆黑。野狗仍然跟刚德在一起，显然已经把他拖到了那里的安全地带。这个可怜的畜生非常高兴有一个朋友能跟他在一起，他想跟刚德玩一个小时，刚德却昏昏欲睡，尽管不远处炮声隆隆，但他还是打起了盹，完全睡着了。

大约三个小时后，这条狗突然发出呜呜声，然后大叫起来，好像患了疯病一般。之后，在一阵阵可怕的爆炸声中，地面摇晃起来。狗难以忍受，就不断用力拽着刚德的大衣袖子。爆炸声一浪高过一浪，直到刚德趴的地方简直像摇篮一样晃动起来，但刚德不愿离开这个藏身之地。他对自己说的所有话就是：“噢，彩虹鸽，你这盖世无双的鸟儿，这项任务你完成得是多么出色！你已经把情报送到了笑容可掬的司令手里，这就是他雷鸣般的回答。噢，你这鸟中的珍品。”当飞机投下的炸弹引燃德军军需供应库的时候，刚德喃喃自语。

接着，那条一直尽力咬着刚德的衣袖想把他拽走的野狗，像发高烧一样哀号哆嗦起来。正在此时，一个东西咝咝作响破空而来，砰的一声落在附近。可怜的野狗不顾一切地嗥叫着冲出藏身地，刚德尾随其后。但是，已经来不及了。因为他刚从荆棘下面爬到一半，一阵震耳欲聋的爆炸声好像炸开了他下面的地面，一阵剧痛刺穿了他的肩膀。他感觉被某种魔力抛起来，又重重摔到了地上，深红色的钻石般的光芒在他眼前跳动了一会儿，接着就是一片昏暗。

一个小时后，刚德恢复了知觉，首先听到的就是一个印度斯坦人的声音。为了更加清晰地听到母语，他努力抬起头。那个时刻，他感觉就像被几千条眼镜蛇叮咬般的闪痛。毫无疑问，现在他的脑海里想到的是他被打中了，很可能是致命伤。同时，每次听到印度斯坦人在他附近说话，他心里又感到高兴，因为那意味着现在是印度军队而不是敌人占领了森林。“啊，”他对自己说，“我的任务完成了，我可以安息了。”

第七章　彩虹鸽讲述如何送情报


“那个重要日子前的整个夜晚，我没大合眼。尽管我藏在刚德的大衣下面，但他并不知道我醒着。你贴在一个时而像公鹿奔跑，时而像松鼠爬树，时而收留陌生狗做伴的人的心脏旁边，是不可能入睡的……刚德的心脏不时地咚咚直跳，你也许在几码开外都能听到。在如此近的距离内，他还做了一件让你睡不着的事情；整整一夜，他呼吸都不均匀。他时而长长地吸气，时而急促地呼吸，就像一只逃离猫的老鼠一般。我在这样一个人的大衣下面睡觉，还不如设法在暴风雨天里睡觉。

“然后，就是那条狗！我何尝忘记他呢？当刚德第一次遇到他的时候，我吓得要死，但他没有闻到我身上的气味，不知何故，从下面升起的空气告诉我，他完全就像幽灵一般，最终他却成了我们的朋友。他的脚步声我一辈子都难以忘记，他走起路来像猫一样轻柔。他一定是一条野狗，因为住在文明世界的狗都很吵闹，他们甚至不会悄声走路。人类的伙伴都在堕落，除了猫之外，每种动物在人类社会里都变得粗心吵闹。但是，这条狗完全是野生的，他走起路来悄无声息，他连呼吸都不出声。那么，我又是怎么知道他在那里的呢？是从地上升起的扑鼻而来的气味。

“经过了一个极不舒服的无眠之夜，刚德放飞了我，我几乎认不出他放飞我的那个地方。所以，我从一棵树飞到另一棵树，找到自己的方位，这只会让我大吃一惊。因为现在天已经亮了，树林里到处都是眼睛。一些陌生的蓝眼睛通过管子望着不同的方向。他们后面有一些人，一个人从树梢上望着，距离我栖息的地方大约一英尺。因为我们周围所有那些铁狗都在狂叫——噗啪啪啪啪，所以他没有听到我飞来。

“可是，当我飞起的时候，他看到了我。我觉得，要是我没有赶紧藏在其他树下，他就会打死我；他的确开了好多枪，但我躲在了像隐士的头发那样浓密的杂树丛后面。我决定先从一棵树跳到另一棵树上，直到前方没有危险。我花了不少时间这样跳了大约半英里。最后，我的双脚感觉疲惫不堪，于是我决定起飞，不管有没有危险。

“幸运的是，没有人看到我起飞。我在空中兜了几个大圈后，飞上高空。我从树木看上去小得像树苗一样的森林处，朝不同的方向张望。在东方露出曙光的天空中，一群飞机像金色战车一样从远处飞过来。这意味着，要是我等待过久，敌人就会向我扑来。于是，我开始向西飞去。这仿佛是树顶上千个狙击手要向我开火的信号。

“我想，当我盘旋而上飞到德国兵藏身的树顶上方的时候，他们拿不准我是不是他们的信鸽，但狙击手们一观察到我向西飞去，就确定我不是他们的信鸽，一起朝我开火，想把我打下来，查明我脚上带的是什么情报。

“不管怎样，在清冷的冬日天空中，我不可能不被冻僵永远向上飞，我不想让那些敌机超过我，我又一次向西猛冲。又一堵子弹墙像死亡之网一样在我面前展开。可是，我别无选择，要么闯过去，要么被逼近的敌机打死，这些飞机飞得很近，我都能看清里面的人。于是，我继续向西猛冲。幸运的是，大约一个月前受伤的尾巴到现在几乎已经恢复了正常大小。要是没有这个尾羽，完成任务就会难上加难。我继续向我们的阵地飞去，枪炮的齐射越来越猛。毫无疑问，所有狙击手和远处战壕里的人都在向我射击。我曲折前行，盘旋，翻滚，实际上我施展了自己知道的所有绝技，来躲避越来越密集的枪林弹雨，但这一切弯来绕去的动作浪费了我一些时间。我稍微动一下，其中一架飞机已经飞到了攻击距离内，开始从我后面和上方密集开火。我只有向前飞，所以就继续向前冲。噢！我飞得是多么起劲——像最激烈的暴风雨一样迅疾。随后——啪嗒啪嗒噗——我被打中了！我的腿断了，子弹正打在了大腿根附近，那条系着情报的腿像隼爪下面挂着的一只麻雀一样耷拉着。噢！尽管疼痛难忍，但我没有时间去想，因为飞机还在追我，我比先前更加努力地飞着。

“终于，我们自己的阵地进入了我的视野。我飞低了些，那架飞机也俯冲了下来。我设法翻滚，但都没有成功，我的那条腿使我尝试不了任何技巧。接着，啪——啪——啪嗒——啪嗒嗒——我的尾翼被打中了，羽毛纷纷飘落，一时间遮住了德军战壕里士兵的视线。所以，我倾斜着向我们的阵地飞去——一下子飞过了头，就又兜了个圈。随后，我看到了奇异的一幕——那架飞机被我们的士兵打中了。它摇摇晃晃、歪歪扭扭坠落下来。然而，在坠落起火之前，它做了一件最糟糕的事情——击中并打断了我的右翅。看到它在空中着火坠落，我感到满意，但我越来越疼痛，感觉好像有二十只秃鹰正在把我撕成碎片。不过，多亏了鸽神，我失去了痛苦或快乐的感觉，觉得仿佛有一座大山似的重量在把我向下拉……

“他们让我住了一个月的鸽子医院。尽管我的翅膀得到了修复，那条腿也被接好了，但它们再也无法支持我飞起来了。我每次跃向空中，不知怎么回事，耳朵里都充满了可怕的枪声，眼睛只看到燃烧的子弹。我非常害怕，会马上冲到地上。你可能会说，我听到的是想象的声音，看到的是想象的子弹墙，可能是，但它们产生的效果对我来说跟真的一样。我的翅膀瘫痪了，内脏因恐惧而冰封。

“除此以外，没有刚德，我不愿飞行。一个人的肤色不是棕色的，眼睛又是蓝色的，我为什么要从他的手上起飞呢？我以前从不了解这种人。我们鸽子不喜欢所有的局外人。最后，他们把我放进笼子，带到了刚德所在的那家医院，把我留在他的身边。我看到他的时候，简直认不出他了，因为他的眼睛——刚德的眼睛——带着一种真正恐惧的神色！是的，这一次他也被吓得不知所措。像所有的鸟类和野兽一样，我知道恐惧是什么样子，所以我为刚德感到难过。

“可是，他一看到我，那层恐惧的薄膜就离开了他的眼睛，他的眼里燃起了快乐的光芒。他在床上坐起来，双手抱住我，亲吻我的脚，这只脚上曾经绑过他要送的那份情报。随后，他轻轻地拍了拍我的右翅，说：‘即使非常痛苦，噢，你这神圣羽毛的星座，你把主人的情报带给了朋友们，为所有的鸽子和整个印度军队赢得了荣誉。’他又一次亲吻了我的脚。他的谦卑打动了我，他也让我谦卑起来。我记得，当那架飞机把我的翅膀部分打断之后，我落在印度军队战壕的时候，我不再感到骄傲，因为要是我当时落在德军的战壕，那么……他们就会抢走系在我腿上的那份情报，他们会团团包围刚德和那条野狗藏身的森林——想到他们会做的一切，我就瑟瑟发抖！唉！那条狗，我们真正的朋友和救星，他如今在哪里呢？”





第八章　治愈仇恨和恐惧


“那条狗，”刚德又讲起了故事，“一定是在战争初期就已经失去了他的法国主人，很可能是那些德国人射杀了他的主人。之后，当看到主人的家遭到洗劫、粮仓被烧的时候，他吓得发狂，跑进了远离人类的树林，藏在浓密黑暗的荆棘丛下面，荆棘丛像小屋一样宽敞，又像坟墓一样黑暗。说不定他只在夜里出去觅食，尽管根据遗传他是猎狗，但由于日复一日、夜复一夜像亡命徒一样待在树林里，他所有的野性便又苏醒了。

“他突然遇到我的时候，吃了一惊，因为我并不害怕，我没有发出任何害怕的气味。我一定是几个月里第一个没有因为恐惧吓得他发动攻击的人。

“当然，他认为我也像他一样饿，正在寻找食物，所以，他把我领到了德军食品仓库。他从地下通道爬进一个巨大的供应品库——完全是一座食品宝库——为我叼回了一些肉。我推断那里有一系列地下库房，德国人在那里不仅储存食品，而且还储存石油和炸药。于是，我就采取了行动。感谢上帝，我的推断没错。让我们改变话题吧。

“老实告诉你，我讨厌谈论战争。瞧，夕阳正在照亮喜马拉雅山的群峰。珠穆朗玛峰像金炉一样熊熊燃烧。让我们祈祷：





“‘引领我从虚幻走向真实，

从黑暗走向光明，

从喧哗走向宁静。’”





禅定过后，刚德默默地走出了我们的屋子，从加尔各答启程去了新格里拉附近的那座喇嘛庙。但是，在讲述他在那里的冒险之旅以前，我必须告诉读者刚德是如何被从法国战场转移到我们家的。

一九一五年二月下旬，孟加拉政府军完全明白彩虹鸽再也不会飞了，带着彩虹鸽前来的刚德根本不是一名士兵，除了老虎或花豹之外，刚德一生中从来没有猎杀过任何东西，而且，因为刚德也病了，所以他和彩虹鸽作为病号一起被送回了印度。他们三月份抵达加尔各答。看到他们的时候，我都无法相信自己的眼睛。像彩虹鸽一样，刚德一副受惊吓的样子，他们俩都显得病恹恹的。

刚德把鸽子送给我，在动身去喜马拉雅山之前，他对我说明了几件事。“我需要去治愈恐惧和仇恨，我看到了太多人与人之间的厮杀。我因病被遣送回家，因为我患了一种可怕的疾病——恐惧症，所以我必须独自走向大自然，治愈自己的恐惧症。”

于是，刚德前往新格里拉，前往喇嘛庙，要通过祈祷和禅定来治愈自己。与此同时，我尽最大努力治疗彩虹鸽。彩虹鸽的太太和发育完全的孩子们都帮不了他。孩子们把他当成了一个陌生人，因为他对他们毫不关心，但他的太太对他格外关心，可就连她也无法使彩虹鸽起飞。除了单脚跳一小会儿之外，彩虹鸽坚决拒绝做任何事情，什么也无法引导他飞上天空。我请医术高明的鸽医细查他的翅膀和双腿，鸽医们都说他没有什么毛病了。他的骨头和两只翅膀都健全，但他还是不愿飞，甚至拒绝张开右翅，无论什么时候都不跑也不跳，还养成了单脚站立的习惯。

要不是那个时候彩虹鸽和他的太太开始筑巢，我本来对这一点不会在意。快到四月中旬，当开始避暑度假的时候，我收到了刚德的一封信。“你的彩虹鸽，”他告诉我说，“还不应该筑巢。要是生了蛋，就毁掉它们，在任何情况下，都不要让它们孵化。像彩虹鸽这样患上恐惧症的父亲——只能给这个世界带来病弱的鸽宝宝。你把彩虹鸽带到这里来。最后，我必须说我感觉好了些。马上把彩虹鸽带来，神圣的喇嘛希望见到你和他。此外，五只雨燕这个星期都已经从南方飞回来了，他们肯定会让你的爱鸟高兴。”

我听从了刚德的建议，把彩虹鸽和他的太太各放进一只笼子，然后就带着他们向北方出发了。

春天的山跟去年秋天的山是多么不一样啊！因为出现紧急情况，所以我的父母亲比往常早几个月就打开了位于丹坦的房子。四月的最后一个星期在那里安顿下来之后，我就留下彩虹鸽的太太，随身带着彩虹鸽，跟藏族人的马帮一起向新格里拉出发了。这样，要是彩虹鸽能再次飞起来，他就会飞回到太太的身边——这正是治愈彩虹鸽的方法。他太太将是最后一张王牌。刚德认为彩虹鸽也许能做到，以便返回去帮助他的太太孵化那些刚生下来的蛋，尽管我的父母亲在我们出发后那天就毁掉了那些蛋；因为我们不想要生病退化的鸽宝宝，他们长大后会让彩虹鸽威名扫地。

我把鸽子放在自己的肩上，他整天栖息在那里。夜间，我们把彩虹鸽安全地锁在笼子里，这对他有好处。十二小时的山地空气和光照改善了他的身体状况，但他一次也没有努力飞离我的肩膀，飞回配偶身边，帮助她孵卵。





春天的喜马拉雅山独一无二。在炎热潮湿的峡谷里，地面上到处都闪耀着白色紫罗兰，其间点缀着已经成熟的树莓，蕨类植物伸展宽大的手臂，仿佛要拥抱白色的山峦，白色的山峦犹如宝石一般躺在靛蓝色的天空中。有时候，我们穿过浓密的森林，那里生长着数量众多、枝叶繁茂、遮天蔽日的矮生橡树、硕大的榆树、喜马拉雅雪杉（雪松）和栗子树。树挨着树，枝连着枝，根缠着根，为了光明和生命，奋力搏击。在黑黢黢的树下面，好多鹿啃吃着茂盛的高草和树苗，结果会被老虎、猎豹和黑豹吞吃。到处生机盎然，鸟兽和植物都在为生存展开越来越激烈的斗争。这就是自相矛盾的生存法则，就连昆虫也难以摆脱。

当我们从森林的黑暗地带走出来，看到开阔地的时候，火辣辣的热带阳光突然向我们无助的眼睛射进了金刚石刻刀一般的火光。金黄色的颤抖着的蜻蜓飞满了天空；蝴蝶、麻雀、知更鸟、松鸡、鹦鹉、印度画眉、松鸦和孔雀吵闹着从这棵树追到那棵树，从一座山峰飞到更高的山峰。

这时候，我们来到了茶园之间的开阔地带，一侧是道路，一侧是松林。我们踉踉跄跄，奋力爬上了简直像刀锋一样陡直的斜坡。那里空气非常稀薄，我们简直喘不过气来，声音和回响传得很远，就连一声耳语也能传到几码外，人和动物都变得一样沉默。除了动物蹄子的嘚嘚声以外，那些马跟人一样怀着一种敬畏感，走向压制我们的孤独和沉静。这里，靛蓝色的天空仍然纯净无云，除了一群长鸣北飞的白鹤或附近一只声音低沉、倾斜飞扑的老鹰，没有受到任何打扰，一切都清冷、凛冽、活跃。兰花几乎一夜之间绽放开来，向我们睁开了紫色的眼睛，万寿菊落满了晨露，而在下面的湖里，蓝色和白色的莲花纷纷对蜜蜂打开了花瓣。

现在我们快要到新格里拉了。喇嘛庙抬起头，从山坡上召唤着我们。喇嘛庙的飞檐房顶和古色古香的墙壁像一面旗帜在地平线上飘浮。我受到鼓舞，加快了脚步，一个小时就爬上了喇嘛庙的陡峭道路。

置身于超越我们日常生活之战的人当中，感觉是多么轻松啊！中午时分，我和刚德穿过一片香脂林，来到了泉水边。我们在里面沐浴，给彩虹鸽彻底洗了洗。鸽子在笼子里吃过饭之后，我和刚德来到了餐厅。喇嘛们坐在那里等着我们。房间看上去像是檀木柱廊，柱顶上装饰着金龙。历经几百年完全变黑的柚木大梁，雕刻着宽大清晰的莲花图案，既像茉莉花一样精致，又像金属一样结实。身穿橙色长袍的喇嘛们默默地坐在红砂岩地上祈祷，这是他们每次开饭前的感恩祈祷。我和刚德在餐厅门口等着，直到祈祷结束，齐声诵唱，就像格里高利圣咏[1]：





智慧里，佛陀是我们的庇护。

宗教里，佛陀是我们的庇护。

真理宝石（在生命莲花里闪光）里，佛陀是我们的庇护。





这时候，我走上前，向方丈致敬。方丈祝福我的时候，神情庄严，面带微笑。我向其他喇嘛行过礼之后，我和刚德坐在餐桌边。餐桌是由一连串小木凳拼成的，我们坐在地上，桌子到我们的胸部。非常炎热的一天的旅途之后，坐在凉爽的地板上真不错。我们的食物是扁豆汤、煎土豆和咖喱茄子。因为我和刚德都吃素食，所以我们没有吃端到桌子上的鸡蛋。我们的饮料是热气腾腾的绿茶。

饭后，方丈邀请我和刚德跟他去午休，于是我们跟他一起爬上最顶端的悬崖，悬崖像鹰巢一般，悬崖上方生长着一丛冷杉。我们在那里发现一间空荡荡的小石屋，里面没有任何一件家具。我以前从来没有见过这种小屋。我们在那里落座后，方丈说：“在这座喇嘛庙里，我们每天都会向大慈大悲的神祈祷两次，希望能治愈普天下的疾病。然而，战争持续，就连鸟兽都染上了恐惧和仇恨。情绪的疾病比身体的疾病蔓延得更快。人类充满恐惧、仇恨、疑虑和恶意，要完全解脱这些情绪疾病，可能要耗费整整一代人的时间。”

此时，喇嘛因无限的悲伤而皱起了眉头，因筋疲力尽而嘴角耷拉。尽管他住在远离战场的鹰巢似的小屋里，但他比那些投入战争的人更深刻地感受到人类罪恶的负担。

不过，他继续微笑着说：“让我们谈论一下跟我们待在一起的彩虹鸽和刚德吧。要是你希望你的鸽子再次展翅飞翔在宁静的天空，你就必须禅定，冥想无限的勇气，就像刚德这些天一直为自己做的那样。”

“怎么做到，长老？”我急切地问道。方丈的黄脸泛起了红色，毫无疑问，我直截了当的提问使他感到尴尬，我也感到不好意思。直截了当，像匆匆忙忙一样，非常下作。

方丈好像明白我的感受，为了让我放松，他说：“每个黎明和傍晚，让彩虹鸽趴在你的肩上，你对自己说：‘无限的勇气在我的整个生命中，每一种活着和会呼吸的生命都是一座拥有无限勇气的宝库。愿我足够纯洁，将无限的勇气充满我接触的那些生命吧！’要是你这样做一阵子，总有一天你的心智、精神和灵魂就会变得彻底纯洁。那一刻，你将不再恐惧，不再仇恨，不再多疑，你灵魂的力量将会进入鸽子的身体，使他获得自由。要是一个人最大程度地净化自己，那他就会给这个世界注入最伟大的精神力量。按我建议你的一天做两次，我们所有的喇嘛都会帮助你，让我们看看会有什么结果！”

沉默了一会儿之后，喇嘛接着说道：“刚德曾经对你说过，他比任何人都了解动物，我们的恐惧会使其他动物受到惊吓，从而攻击我们。你的鸽子心惊胆战，以为整个天空都要攻击他，一片树叶掉落，都会让他心惊肉跳，一片阴影落下，都会让他惊慌失措。不过，让他痛苦的却是他自己。

“此时此刻，我们下面的村庄——是的，你可以看到它那里到西北方——正遭受着像彩虹鸽一样的痛苦。因为这是动物们北迁的季节，所以所有受到惊吓的居民都会拿起旧式火绳枪猎杀野兽，看哪，尽管这些野兽以前从来没有攻击过他们，但现在却会攻击他们！野牛过来吃掉他们的庄稼，猎豹偷走他们的山羊。今天有消息传到这里说，昨晚一头野牛咬死了一个人。尽管我告诉他们要通过祈祷和禅定清除思想上的恐惧，但他们不愿这样做。”

“长老啊，为什么，”刚德问道，“你不允许我去为他们除掉那些野兽？”

“还不能，”喇嘛回答说，“尽管你在清醒时刻治愈了恐惧，但你的梦里却藏匿着恐惧的祸根。让我们再祈祷和禅定几天吧，这样你的灵魂里的这一切渣滓就会被清除。那么，等你痊愈之后，如果下面的村民们还在经受那些野兽的伤害，你就可以去帮助他们了。”

第九章　喇嘛的智慧


按照喇嘛规定的方法，大约进行了严格而又最真诚的十天禅定之后，喇嘛派人来找我和彩虹鸽。于是，我两手捧着鸽子，爬上山顶，来到他的小屋。喇嘛通常发黄的脸色今天看上去呈褐色，很有感染力，杏仁状的眼睛里闪现出一种奇异的镇静和力量。他两手抱着彩虹鸽，说道：





愿北风治愈你，

愿南风治愈你，

愿东风和西风治愈你。

恐惧逃离你，

仇恨逃离你，

多疑逃离你。

勇气如湍急的潮汐奔流过你的全身；

平和占据你的整个生命，

宁静和力量已经成为你的翅膀。

你的眼里闪耀着勇气；

力量和英勇住在你的心里！你痊愈了，

你痊愈了，

你痊愈了！

平和，平和，平和！





我们坐在那里冥想那些想法，直到太阳下山，喜马拉雅山峰变成多彩的火焰，我们周围的山谷、洼地和树林都披上了紫光莹莹的斗篷。

慢慢地，彩虹鸽从喇嘛的手里单腿跳下来，走到小屋的入口，望着夕阳。他张开左翅，等待着，随后轻轻地、慢慢地张开右翅，羽毛一根根展开，肌肉一点点放松，最后翅膀终于像船帆一样张开。彩虹鸽没有立刻起飞，没有做出任何夸张的动作，而是仔细地收拢两只翅膀，好像它们是两把珍贵却易碎的扇子。他也知道怎样对夕阳致敬。他带着僧侣般的尊严，走下楼梯，但刚走出我的视野，我就听到了——我想自己听到了——他的翅膀拍打的声音。我正要急忙起身去看到底发生了什么事情，那位圣人却把一只手放在我的肩上，拦住了我，嘴角浮起了神秘的微笑。

第二天早晨，我把这一切告诉了刚德。他尖刻地回答说：“你说，彩虹鸽张开了翅膀向夕阳致敬，这没有什么大惊小怪的。动物们都很虔诚，只不过人类愚昧无知，认为动物不会虔诚罢了。我曾经见到过猴子、老鹰、鸽子、猎豹，甚至猫鼬都崇拜黎明和落日呢。”

“你能领我去看看他们吗？”

刚德回答说：“能，但不是现在。我们去喂彩虹鸽吃早饭吧。”

我们走到笼边的时候，发现笼门打开着——里面没有鸽子。我没有吃惊，因为我们待在喇嘛庙的时候，每天夜里我都没有锁笼子。但是，他到哪里去了呢？我们在主屋里找不到他，于是就去了藏经阁。在外面一间废弃的小屋里，我们发现了他的一些羽毛，刚德还在附近发现了一只黄鼠狼的脚印。这使我们怀疑出了问题。不过，要是黄鼠狼攻击咬死了彩虹鸽，地上就会有血迹。那么，他逃到哪里去了呢？他做了什么？如今他在哪里？我们四处寻找了一个小时。就在我们决定放弃搜寻的时候，我们听到了他在咕咕叫着，只见他站在藏经阁的房顶上，对他的老朋友雨燕们说着话。雨燕们待在屋檐下的窝巢里。我们可以听到雨燕们回应他的咕咕声。雨燕先生说：“吱吱，吱吱，吱吱！”我高兴地对彩虹鸽叫喊，叫他来吃早饭：“啊呀——啊——哎！”他弯了弯脖子，侧耳倾听。随后，当我又叫喊的时候，他看到了我，立刻响亮地拍打着翅膀，飞下来，落在了我的手腕上，镇定自若。黎明时分，他一定听到了喇嘛们拾级而上去晨祷时的脚步声，于是飞出了笼子，然后因为迷路飞到了外面那间小屋。毫无疑问，到了那里，一只缺乏经验的小黄鼠狼攻击过他。一只像彩虹鸽这样老道的鸟儿轻而易举就能仅仅通过拽掉几根羽毛骗过黄鼠狼。当这只满怀希望的小黄鼠狼在许多撕裂的羽毛里面寻找彩虹鸽的时候，那只眼看要成为他口中食的鸽子飞上了天空。在那里，彩虹鸽找到了他的老朋友雨燕，只见雨燕正在飞行着对初升的太阳敬礼。他们一起做完晨祷之后，就飞下来，在藏经阁的房顶上友好地交谈。

那天，非常可怕的消息传到了喇嘛庙，一头疯狂的野牛攻击了那位喇嘛前一天说起过的那个村子。那头野牛前一天晚上到那里去过，顶死了两个从公共打谷场附近聚会之后回家的老人。村民们派代表来找方丈，求他为这头野兽的害人行径祷告，恳请他驱除这头野兽的邪恶灵魂。方丈说，他会在二十四小时后作法，除掉那头杀气腾腾的野牛。“平安回家吧，大慈大悲的众生啊，你们的祈祷会应验的。夜幕降临后，不要冒险出门，待在家里，冥想平和与勇气吧。”在场的刚德问道：“这个家伙已经骚扰你们村多久了？”全体代表断言，一个星期来他每天夜里都来，几乎吃掉了春天的一半庄稼。他们再次强烈恳求通过咒语和驱魔仪式除掉野牛，之后就下山回村了。

代表们离开后，喇嘛对站在旁边的刚德说：“胜利之神的选民啊，既然你被治愈，那就上前杀死那个凶手吧。”

“可是，方丈！”

“刚德，别再害怕了，禅定已经治愈了你。现在通过这一手段在树林里测试一下你在这里获得的一切吧。在孤独中，人们获得力量和镇静，必须在人群中检验一下。从现在起，后天太阳下山之前，你将凯旋。我对你的成功完全信任，我要求你把这个男孩子和他的鸽子带上。要是我怀疑你的力量或这次任务的结局，就肯定不会请你把这个十六岁的男孩子带上了。去吧，把凶手绳之以法。”

那天下午，我们出发前往丛林，我对有望至少在那里再过一夜欢天喜地。跟刚德和彩虹鸽同行是多么开心，他们俩又一次健健康康地去寻找一头疯狂的野牛！地球上有一个不喜欢这种机会的男孩子吗？

因此，我们全副武装，配备了绳梯、套索和猎刀，彩虹鸽站在我的肩上，我们就出发了。英国政府禁止印度普通民众使用枪支，所以我们没有携带枪支。

大约下午三点钟，我们到达了位于喇嘛庙西北方的那个村子。到了那里，我们发现了野牛的踪迹，一路跟踪，穿过茂密树林和宽阔空地，不时地穿过一条小溪，或者不得不爬过一棵棵倒下的巨树。不同寻常的是野牛的脚印多么清晰、多么深。

刚德说：“他一定吓得要死了吧，看看野牛在这里踩得有多深！动物们在正常的不害怕状态下留下的痕迹微乎其微，但害怕的时候，他们行动起来，就像被杀害的恐怖压倒了他们的身体。这个家伙的蹄子大得惊人，所到之处都留下了清晰的蹄印，他一定害怕极了！”

最后，我们遇到了一条难以通行的河流。根据刚德判断，要是我们踏进河流，激流快得足以冲断我们的双腿。说来也怪，那头野牛也不敢穿过这条河。于是，我们顺着河岸继续追踪野牛的蹄印。不到二十分钟，我们就发现这些蹄印突然偏离了河岸，消失在了一片浓密的丛林里。尽管还不到下午五点钟，但那片丛林却黑如深渊。无论野牛有多大年龄，从这个地方跑到村子里用时不可能超过半个小时。

刚德问道：“你听到水声了吗？”听了几分钟之后，我听到了河水流过莎草和不远处其他草的声音，同时传来汩汩涌涌的响声。我们距离一个湖二十英尺左右，河流进了湖里。“那头害人的野牛躲起来了——说不定在这里和湖之间的某个地方睡觉。”刚德大声说道。“那边有两棵孪生树，我们就在其中一棵树上安营扎寨吧。天快要黑了，我相信野牛马上就要到这里了。他出现的时候，我们不能还在丛林的地上。树和树之间几乎只有不到四英尺的空间。”

他的最后一句话让我感到好奇。于是，我仔细观察了一下树和树之间的空隙。那些树高大粗壮，相互之间隔着一片土，提供的空间宽得足够我们俩并肩行走。

“现在我要把这身浸透恐惧气息的衣服扔到这两棵树之间。”接着，刚德脱掉一直穿在身上的束腰外衣下面的旧衣服。他把衣服放在地上，然后爬上其中一棵树。爬上去之后，刚德为我扔下一副绳梯，我攀着绳梯向上爬，彩虹鸽在我的肩上拍打着翅膀，以保持平衡。我们俩安全地到达了刚德坐着的树枝上。夜晚就要飞快地降临，我们静静地坐了一会儿。

当黄昏降临的时候，我注意到的第一件事情就是鸟类的生活。苍鹭、犀鸟、松鸡、野鸡、歌雀和成群的翠绿鹦鹉似乎遍布森林，蜜蜂的嗡嗡声、啄木鸟的嗒嗒声和头顶上方老鹰遥远的尖叫，跟奔涌咆哮的山洪声和已经醒来的鬣狗们断断续续的笑声交织在一起。

我们安营扎寨过夜的那棵树非常高大，我们向上爬得更远，以确保我们上方没有猎豹或毒蛇。仔细观察过后，我们选中了两根树枝，把绳梯悬在中间形成了一张结实的吊床。就在我们安顿下来的时候，刚德指着天空。我马上抬起头，只见那里有一只非常大的鹰，利用红宝石色的翅膀悬浮着。尽管黑暗犹如自丛林地面升起的洪水一样，但天空上面的空间“像一只鸽子的颈羽一样”色彩斑斓，孤鹰一次又一次地盘旋着，按照刚德的说法，毫无疑问是在膜拜落日。他的出现已经对森林里的鸟类和虫类产生了一种安抚的作用。尽管孤鹰远在天空，但鸟类和虫类像一群沉默的信徒一样默不作声。这时候，孤鹰作为百鸟之王飞来飞去，仿佛大祭司般入迷地膜拜光明之神。慢慢地，红宝石般的光泽从他的翅膀上退去。此刻，他的翅膀变成了点缀着金色火花的紫色船帆。膜拜好像终于结束了，孤鹰越飞越高，就像在神面前自焚一样，向熊熊燃烧的火焰峰飞去，然后飞蛾般消失在火焰峰灿烂的光辉之中。

下面，野牛的吼叫声把黑夜的寂静撕成了一个个的碎片，昆虫的鸣叫一个接一个地被解放了出来。一只猫头鹰在附近枭叫，使躲在束腰外衣下面的彩虹鸽紧紧地贴住了我的心脏。突然，一只喜马拉雅噪鹃[1]——夜间鸣鸟，酷似夜莺——唱起了迷人的歌曲，犹如神灵吹奏的银笛，颤音接着颤音，华彩乐章连着华彩乐段，犹如泼洒倾盆大雨，四周宁静，又如雨水顺着树干流下，滴在粗糙的树皮上，落在丛林地面，然后透过根部，渗入地球的心脏。

喜马拉雅山初夏夜晚的魅力将永远难以形容。事实上，它是如此甜美和孤独，我感到昏昏欲睡。刚德用另一根绳子绑住我，使我安全地固定在树干上。随后，我把头靠在他的肩上，以便睡得舒适。但是，还没等我睡着，刚德就对我讲起了他的计划：

“我那些扔掉的衣服是我心里充满恐惧时穿的。它们有一种奇怪的气味。要是那头白痴野牛闻到它们的气味，就会到这里来。他要是受到惊吓，就会对恐惧气味做出反应。他要是来探究我扔掉的衣服，我们就尽我们所能对他采取行动。我希望我们能套住他，把他带回家，让他像小母牛一样温顺……”我没有听到他剩下的话，因为我已经倒头睡着了。

我不知道自己睡了多久，但我突然被一声可怕的吼叫惊醒了。我睁开眼睛的时候，只见刚德已经醒来了，解开了我身上的绳子，指了指下面。在黎明的微光中，起初我什么也没有看见，但我听到了狂暴的野兽发出的呻吟声和咕噜声。热带地区，天亮得快。我聚精会神地向下看。此刻，在越来越亮的天光中，我看到了……我看到的决不可能是另外一种情景。是的，有一只小山似的闪亮乌黑的动物在我们坐着的树下蹭着黝黑的身体侧面。尽管树叶和树干遮住了它一半的身躯，但我推测它有十英尺左右长。看上去这头野兽就像出自绿色熔炉里的一块黑蛋白石，在朝阳下又像新生的绿叶一样闪闪发亮。我想：“自然界中看上去健壮光滑的野牛，在动物园里却脏兮兮的，鬃毛暗淡，皮肤肮脏。那些见过被关着的野牛的人能想象得到他们有多美吗？自然界中的动物价值会比动物园里的高一百倍，大多数年轻人都没有在自然界见过他们，而是从囚禁的表象了解他们，这多么遗憾！要是我们不能通过观看监狱里的囚犯来正确了解人类的道德本性，那我们如何设法通过观察笼里的动物认为我们对动物了如指掌呢？”

不过，还是回到我们树底下那头害人的野牛吧。彩虹鸽被放出了我的外衣，他在树上漫步。我和刚德顺着许多梯子般的树枝向下爬，一直爬到了野牛头顶上方大约两英尺的一根树枝上。野牛没有看到我们。刚德飞快地把长套索的一端绑在树干上。我注意到野牛正在树下玩耍，用犄角不时地挑起一件破烂的衣服，那是刚德的衣服的碎片。毫无疑问，衣服里发出的人的气味已经吸引了他。尽管野牛的犄角很干净，但他的头上留有鲜血的痕迹。显而易见，夜间他又去村子里杀了一个人。这激怒了刚德。他对我耳语道：“我们要活捉他。你从上面把这个套索套到他的犄角上。”转眼之间，刚德已经纵身跳下树枝，靠近了野牛的后部。这吓了野牛一跳。但是，他掉不过头来，因为紧贴着他的右侧是我刚提到过的一棵树，他的左侧是我站在上面的那棵树。为了脱身，他必须要么后退，要么前进，但还没等这一切发生，我就已经把绳索套在了他的头上。他碰到绳子，就像触电似的，赶忙后退，以便摆脱套索，动作飞快，要不是刚德已经绕过另一棵树，就会被野牛锋利的蹄子踩死。但现在，让我万分惊愕的是，我注意到套索没有从根部勒住野牛的两只角，只是成功地套住了其中一只。那一刻，我惊恐地对刚德尖声喊道：“当心！只套住了他的一只角，绳子随时可能会从另一只角上滑落。快跑！快爬上树。”

但是，那个无所畏惧的猎手没有理会我的建议，而是距离很近地站在那里，面对着敌人。紧接着，我看到那头野兽低下头，向前扑去。我恐惧地闭上了眼睛。

当我又睁开眼睛的时候，我看到野牛正在用力拽着套住他那只犄角的绳索，绳索使他无法够到隐蔽着刚德的那棵树。野牛发出可怕的咆哮声弥漫于整个丛林，回声一声接着一声，就像受到惊吓的孩子们的尖叫一般。

因为野牛还没有成功地顶到刚德，所以刚德就抽出一把大约长一英尺半、宽两英寸的锋利匕首，他慢慢地溜到了右侧另一棵树后面，然后就不见了踪影。野牛只是直奔向他最后看到刚德的地方。幸运的是，绳索还在紧紧地套住他的那只角。

这时候，刚德改变了战术，朝相反方向跑去，在树木之间绕来绕去。他这样做，是要去他的气味到不了野牛那里、被风吹到下风向的地方。不过，尽管野牛糊里糊涂，但他还是掉头，尾随其后。到了我们的树下，他又看到了刚德的那件衣服。这激怒了他，他嗅了嗅，然后用角挑了起来。

此时，刚德到了下风向，尽管我看不到他，但我猜到，即使树木挡住了他的视线，他也能通过气味判断出野牛在哪里。野牛一边用角挑穿刚德的衣服，一边又吼叫起来，这引起了四周树丛里的一阵可怕的骚动。一群群猴子不知从哪里钻出来，从一根树枝跑到另一根树枝。几只松鼠像老鼠一般从树上蹿到了丛林地面，然后又蹿回了树上。成群成群的鸟儿，松鸦、苍鹭和鹦鹉，跟乌鸦、猫头鹰和鸢一起四处乱飞尖叫。突然，野牛又发起了冲锋。我看到刚德正面对着野牛，镇定地站在那里。要是我曾见过一个人镇定到极致的话，那这个人就是刚德。野牛的后腿抽动，利剑般向前扑去。这时候，发生了一件事，他后腿直立了起来，毫无疑问，那是套索的拉力，因为套索的一头绑在我们的树上。野牛从地面上腾起好几英尺，然后落地。那一刻，他那个牛角像一根被小孩子折断的小枯枝一样嘎巴一声飞向了空中。折断引起了不可抗拒的冲力，把野牛斜抛到了地上。野牛几乎在翻滚，四条腿在空中猛烈地踢着。说时迟那时快，刚德像燧石飞溅的火花一样纵身向前。看到他的时候，野牛保持平衡，蹲坐下来，喷着鼻息。在他几乎成功地站起来的时候，刚德却把匕首扎向他的肩胛处。匕首致命的锋刃深深地扎进去，刚德用全身的重量压在了上面。火山爆发般的一声吼叫震撼了整个丛林，鲜血喷泉一般喷射而出。我不忍再看这个情景，便又闭上了眼睛。

过了几分钟，我从树上下来，发现那头野牛已经流干了血，倒地身亡，躺在了深深的血泊里。刚德坐在旁边的地上，擦着他与野牛搏斗的时候溅在身上的血迹。我知道他希望不受干扰。于是，我就走到原来那棵树下，呼喊彩虹鸽。彩虹鸽没有任何回应。我一路爬到树顶，但一无所获——他不在那里。

我从树上下来的时候，刚德已经擦净了自己身上的血迹。他指向天空。我们看到了大自然的清洁工食腐动物。鸢在下面，秃鹫高高地飞在他们上空。他们已经得知某个动物死了，所以他们必须清扫丛林。

刚德说：“我们会在喇嘛庙找到彩虹鸽。毫无疑问，他跟其他鸟儿一起飞走了。我们立刻离开这里吧。”但是，在向喇嘛庙出发之前，我走过去察看死去的野牛，苍蝇已从四面八方飞向野牛那里。野牛身长十英尺半，前腿目测有三英尺多长。

我们一路跋涉默默地返回喇嘛庙，大约中午时分，当我们走到那个遭殃的村子的时候，这种沉默才被打破。我们告诉村长说他们的敌人死了。听到这个消息，村长松了口气，尽管他非常伤心，因为前一天晚上，野牛顶死了他的老母亲，日落之前他的母亲正走向村庙去祈祷。

我们饥肠辘辘，走得飞快，很快就到了喇嘛庙。我马上询问彩虹鸽的情况，彩虹鸽不在那里。这很糟糕，但是，我们在老方丈的小屋里交谈的时候，方丈说：“刚德，他像你一样平安无事。”停顿了几分钟之后，他问道：“是什么打扰了你内心的宁静？”

这位老猎手默默地想出了自己要说的话：“长老，除了这一点之外，没什么，这一点就是我讨厌杀死任何生物。我本来想活捉那头野牛，唉！我不得不消灭了他。他的那只角折断了，我别无选择，只好把刀子插进了他的命脉。真对不起，我活捉不了他，要是能活捉，我就能把他卖给动物园了。”

“噢，你这财迷！”我大声嚷道，“野牛死了，我并不遗憾，死了比关进动物园过后半辈子强。真正的死亡比生不如死更可取。”

“要是你把套索套在他的两只角上就好了！”刚德反驳说。

方丈突然说道：“你们俩应该关心彩虹鸽，而不是关心已经死亡的东西。”

刚德说：“没错，我们明天就去寻找彩虹鸽。”

但是，方丈回答说：“不，我的孩子，你们返回丹坦。你们的家人正在为你们担心。我听得到他们的想法。”

第二天，我们骑着两匹小马，动身赶往丹坦。我们急行军，每天在不同的驿站换两次马，不到三天时间就赶到了丹坦。我们正要拾级而上走向我们的房子的时候，碰到了家里一个非常激动的仆人，他说彩虹鸽三天前就已经回来了。但是，因为我们没有跟他一起回来，所以我的父母亲就开始担心，曾经派出了几批人寻找我们，看是死是活。

我和刚德几乎是跑到了家里。又过了十分钟，妈妈怀抱着我，彩虹鸽站在我的头上，扑动着翅膀，以保持平衡。

听到彩虹鸽最后又飞起来的时候，我高兴得难以言表。彩虹鸽从喇嘛庙一路飞到了我们位于丹坦的家，他既没有退缩，也没有失败！“噢，你这飞行的精灵，你这鸽子中的珍品。”当我和刚德加快步伐的时候，我大声地自言自语道。

就这样我们结束了新格里拉朝圣之行。这次朝圣之行治愈了彩虹鸽和刚德在战场上患上的恐惧和仇恨的疾病。要是这次旅行治愈了生命里最糟糕的疾病之一，这努力就不会白费。

在这个故事的结尾，我不会布道拖延时间，让我这样说：

“我们的所思所感会影响我们的一言一行，一个人要是感到恐惧，哪怕是无意识的，即便是睡梦中染上哪怕一点仇恨，迟早都会不可避免地把这两种东西转化为行动。因此，我的兄弟们，历练勇气，吸纳勇气，彰显勇气。想着爱，感受爱，你们就能从自身倾泻出和平与宁静，就像一朵鲜花散发芬芳一样自然。

“愿平和降临众生！”

To Suresh Chandra Banerji, Esq.


Dear Suresh:

Since Gay-Neck needs a protector, I thought of you for several reasons. First of all, being a poet, an observer of nature, and a traveller, you would be able to protect the book from being condemned. In fact, there is no one who can do it as well as yourself.

You know the country where Gay-Neck grew. You are versed in the lore of birds. For a pigeon, life is a repetition of two incidents: namely, quest of food and avoidance of attacks by its enemies. If the hero of the present book repeats his escape from attacks by hawks, it is because that is the sort of mishap that becomes chronic in the case of pigeons.

Now as to my sources, you well know that they are too numerous to be mentioned here. Many hunters, poets like yourself, and books in many languages have helped me to write Gay-Neck. And if you will permit it, I hope to discharge at least a part of my debt by dedicating this book to one of my sources—yourself.





I remain most faithfully yours,

Dhan Gopal





PART ONE





Chapter One Birth of Gay-Neck


The city of Calcutta, which boasts of a million people, must have at least two million pigeons. Every third Hindu boy has perhaps a dozen pet carriers, tumblers, fan-tails and pouters. The art of domesticating pigeons goes back thousands of years in India, and she has contributed two species of pigeons as a special product of her bird fanciers, the fan-tail and the pouter. Love and care have been showered on pigeons for centuries by emperors, princes and queens in their marble palaces, as well as by the poor, in their humble homes. The gardens, grottos and fountains of the Indian rich—the small field of flowers and fruits of the common folk, each has its ornament and music—many-coloured pigeons and cooing white doves with ruby eyes.

Even now, any winter morning, foreigners who visit our big cities may see on the flat-rooted houses innumerable boys waving white flags as signals to their pet pigeons flying up in the crisp cold air. Through the blue heavens flocks of the birds soar like vast clouds. They start in small flocks, and spend about twenty minutes circling over the roofs of their owners' homes. Then they slowly ascend, and all the separate groups from different houses of the town merge into one big flock, and float far out of sight. How they ever return to their own homes is a wonder, for all the house-tops look alike in shape in spite of their rose, yellow, violet and white colours.

But pigeons have an amazing sense of direction and love of their owners. I have yet to see creatures more loyal than pigeons and elephants. I have played with both, and the tusker on four feet in the country, or the bird on two wings in the city, no matter how far they wandered, were by their almost infallible instinct brought back to their friend and brother—Man.

My elephant friend was called Kari, of whom you have heard before, and the other pet that I knew well was a pigeon. His name was Chitra-griva; Chitra meaning "painted in gay colours," and Griva, "neck"—in one phrase, pigeon Gay-Neck. Sometimes he was called "Iridescence-throated."

Of course, Gay-Neck did not come out of his egg with an iridescent throat; he had to grow the feathers week by week; and until he was three months old, there was very little hope that he would acquire the brilliant collar; but at last, when he did achieve it, he was the most beautiful pigeon in my town in India, and the boys of my town owned forty thousand pigeons.

But I must begin this story at the very beginning. I mean with Gay-Neck's parents. His father was a tumbler who married the most beautiful pigeon of his day; she came from a noble old stock of carriers. That is why Gay-Neck proved himself later such a worthy carrier pigeon in war as well as in peace. From his mother he inherited wisdom, from his father bravery and alertness. He was so quick-witted that sometimes he escaped the clutches of a hawk by tumbling at the last moment right over the enemy's head. But of that later, in its proper time and place.

Now let me tell you what a narrow escape Gay-Neck had while still in the egg. I shall never forget the day when, through a mistake of mine, I broke one of the two eggs that his mother had laid. It was very stupid of me. I regret it even now. Who knows? Maybe with that broken egg perished the finest pigeon of the world. It happened in this way. Our house was four stories high—and on its roof was built our pigeon-house. A few days after the eggs were laid I decided to clean the pigeon-hole in which Gay-Neck's mother was sitting on them. I lifted her gently and put her on the roof beside me. Then I lifted each egg carefully and put it most softly in the next pigeon hole, which, however, had no cotton or flannel on its hard wooden floor. Then I busied myself with the task of removing the debris from the birth-nest. As soon as that was done, I brought one egg back and restored it to its proper place. Next I reached for the second one and laid a gentle but firm hand on it. Just then something fell upon my face like a roof blown by the storm. It was Gay-Neck's father furiously beating my face with his wings. Worse still, he had placed the claws of one of his feet on my nose. The pain and surprise of it was so great that ere I knew how, I had dropped the egg. I was engrossed in beating off the bird from my head and face, and at last he flew away. But too late: the little egg lay broken in a mess at my feet. I was furious with its clumsy father and also with myself. Why with myself? Because I should have been prepared for the father bird's attack. He took me for a stealer of his eggs, and in his ignorance was risking his life to prevent my robbing his nest. May I impress it upon you that you should anticipate all kinds of surprise attacks when cleaning a bird's home during nesting season.

But to go on with our story. The mother bird knew the day when she was to break open the egg-shell with her own beak, in order to usher Gay-Neck into the world. Though the male sits on the egg pretty nearly one-third of the time—for he does that each day from morning till late afternoon—yet he does not know when the hour of his child's birth is at hand. No one save the mother bird arrives at that divine certainty. We do not yet understand the nature of the unique wireless message by which she learns that within the shell the yolk and the white of her egg have turned into a baby-bird. She also knows how to tap the right spot so that the shell will break open without injuring her child in the slightest. To me that is as good as a miracle.

Gay-Neck's birth happened exactly as I have described. About the twentieth day after the laying of the egg, I noticed that the mother was not sitting on it any more. She pecked the father and drove him away every time he flew down from the roof of the house and volunteered to sit on the egg. Then he cooed, which meant, "Why do you send me away?"

She, the mother, just pecked him the more, meaning, "Please go. The business on hand is very serious."

At that, the father flew away. That worried me, for I was anxious for the egg to hatch, and was feeling suspicious about its doing it at all. With increased interest and anxiety I watched the pigeon-hole. An hour passed. Nothing happened. It was about the third quarter of the next hour that the mother turned her head one way and listened to something—probably a stirring inside that egg. Then she gave a slight start. I felt as if a tremor were running through her whole body. With it a great resolution came into her. Now she raised her head, and took aim. In two strokes she cracked the egg open, revealing a wee bird, all beak and a tiny shivering body! Now watch the mother. She is surprised. Was it this that she was expecting all these long days? Oh, how small, how helpless! The moment she realizes her child's helplessness, she covers him up with the soft blue feathers of her breast.





Chapter Two Education of Gay-Neck


There are two sweet sights in the bird world: one when the mother breaks open her egg in order to bring to light her child, and the other when she broods and feeds him. Gay-Neck was brooded most affectionately by both his parents. This brooding did for him what cuddling does for human children. It gives the helpless ones warmth and happiness. It is as necessary to them as food. This is the time when a pigeon-hole should not be stuffed with too much cotton or flannel, which should be put there more and more sparingly so that the temperature of the nest does not get too hot. Ignorant pigeon fanciers do not realize that as the baby grows larger he puts forth more and more heat from his own body. And I think it is wise not to clean the nest frequently during this time. Everything that the parents allow to remain in the nest contributes to making their baby comfortable and happy.

I remember distinctly how, from the second day of his birth, little Gay-Neck automatically opened his beak and expanded his carnation-coloured body like a bellows every time one of his parents flew back to their nest. The father or the mother put their beaks into his wide-open maw and poured into it the milk made in their own organs from millet seeds that they had eaten. I noticed this; the food that was poured into his mouth was very soft. No pigeon ever gives any seeds to its baby even when it is nearly a month old without first keeping them in its throat for some time, which softens the food before it enters the delicate stomach of the baby.

Our Gay-Neck was a tremendous eater. He kept one of his parents busy getting food while the other brooded or stayed with him. I think the father bird brooded and worked for him no less hard than the mother. No wonder his body grew very fat. His carnation colour changed into a yellowish-white—the first sign of feathers coming on. Then that gave way to prickly white feathers, round and somewhat stiff, like a porcupine needle. The yellow things that hung about his mouth and eyes fell away. Slowly the beak emerged, firm, sharp and long. What a powerful jaw! When he was about three weeks old, an ant was crawling past him into the pigeon hole at whose entrance he was sitting. Without any instruction from anybody he struck it with his beak. Where there had been a whole ant now lay its two halves. He brought his nose down to the dead ant and examined what he had done. There was no doubt that he had taken that black ant for a seed, and killed an innocent passer-by who was friendly to his race. Let us hope he was ashamed of it. Anyway, he never killed another ant the rest of his life.

By the time he was five weeks old he could hop out of his birth nest and take a drink from the pan of water left near the pigeon holes. Even now he had to be fed by his parents, though every day he tried to get food on his own account. He would sit on my wrist and dig up a seed at a time from the palm of my hand. He juggled it two or three times in his throat like a juggler throwing up balls in the air, and swallowed it. Every time Gay-neck did that, he turned his head and looked into my eyes as much as to say: "Am I not doing it well? You must tell my parents how clever I am when they come down from sunning themselves on the roof." All the same, he was the slowest of my pigeons in developing his powers.

Just at this time I made a discovery. I never knew before how pigeons could fly in a dust-storm without going blind. But as I watched the ever-growing Gay-Neck, I noticed one day that a film was drawn over his eyes. I thought he was losing his sight. In my consternation I put forth my hand to draw him nearer to my face in order to examine him closely. No sooner had I made the gesture than he opened his golden eyes and receded into the rear of the hole. But just the same I caught him and took him up on the roof, and in the burning sunlight of May I scrutinized his eyelids. Yes, there it was: he had, attached to his eyelid, another thin lid as delicate as tissue paper, and every time I put his face toward the sun he drew that film over the two orbits of gold. And so I learned that it was a protective film for the eye that enabled the bird to fly in a dust-storm or straight toward the sun.

In another fortnight Gay-Neck was taught how to fly. It was not at all easy, bird though he was by birth. A human child may love the water, yet he has to make mistakes and swallow water while learning the art of swimming. Similarly with my pigeon. He had a mild distrust of opening his wings, and for hours he sat on our roof, where the winds of the sky blew without quickening him to flight. In order to make the situation clear, let me describe our roof to you. It was railed with a solid concrete wall as high as a boy of fourteen. That prevented even a sleep-walker from slipping off the height of four stories on summer nights, when most of us slept on the roof.

Gay-Neck I put on that concrete wall every day. There he sat for hours at a time, facing the wind, but that was all. One day I put some peanuts on the roof and called him to hop down and get them. He looked at me with an inquiring eye for a few moments. Turning from me, he looked down again at the peanuts. He repeated this process several times. When at last he was convinced that I was not going to bring these delicious morsels up for him to eat, he began to walk up and down the railing, craning his neck occasionally towards the peanuts about three feet below. At last, after fifteen minutes of heart-breaking hesitancy, he hopped down. Just as his feet struck the floor, his wings, hitherto unopened, suddenly spread themselves out full sail as he balanced himself over the nuts. What a triumph!

About this time I noticed the change of colours on his feathers. Instead of a nondescript grey-blue, a glossy aquamarine glowed all over him. And suddenly one morning in the sunlight his throat glistened like iridescent beads.

Now came the supreme question of flight. I waited for his parents to teach him the first lessons, though I helped the only way I could. Every day for a few minutes I made him perch on my wrist; then I would swing my arm up and down many times, and in order to balance himself on such a difficult perch he had to shut and open his wings frequently. That was good for him, but there ended my part of the teaching. You may ask me the reason of my hurrying matters so. He was already behind in his flying lessons, and in June the rains begin to fall in India; and with the approach of the rainy season any long flight becomes impossible. I wished to train him in learning his directions as soon as I could.

However, one day long before the end of May, his father undertook the task. This particular day a brisk north wind, which had been sweeping about and cooling the atmosphere of the city, had just died down. The sky was as clear as a limpid sapphire. The spaces were so clear that you could see the house-tops of our town, then the fields and arbours of the country in the farthest distance. About three o'clock in the afternoon, Gay-Neck was sunning himself on the concrete wall of the roof. His father, who had been flying about in the air, came down and perched next to him. He looked at his son with a queer glance, as much as to say: "Here, lazy-bones, you are nearly three months old, yet you do not dare to fly. Are you a pigeon or an earthworm?" But Gay-Neck, the soul of dignity, made no answer. That exasperated his father, who began to coo and boom at him in pigeon-language. In order to get away from that volubility, Gay-Neck moved; but his father followed, cooing, booming and banging his wings. Gay-Neck went on removing himself farther and farther; and the old fellow, instead of relenting, redoubled his talk, and pursued. At last the father pushed him so close to the edge that Gay-Neck had only one alternative, that is, to slip off the roof. Suddenly his father thrust upon his young body all the weight of his old frame. Gay-Neck slipped. Hardly had he fallen half a foot when he opened his wings, and flew. Oh, what an exhilarating moment for all concerned! His mother, who was downstairs dipping herself in the water, and performing her afternoon toilet, came up through the staircase and flew to keep her son company. They circled above the roof for at least ten minutes before they came down to perch. When they reached the roof the mother folded her wings as a matter of course, and sat still. Not so the son: he was in a panic, like a boy walking into cold and deep water. His whole body shook, and his feet trod the roof gingerly as he alighted, skating over it furiously and flapping his wings in order to balance himself. At last he stopped, as his chest struck the side of the wall, and he folded his wings as swiftly as we shut a fan. Gay-Neck was panting with excitement, while his mother rubbed him and placed her chest against him as if he were a mere baby who badly needed brooding. Seeing that his task had been done successfully, Gay-Neck's father went down to take his bath.





Chapter Three Training in Direction


Now that, like a newly trained diver, he had overcome his fear of plunging into the air, Gay-Neck ventured on longer and higher flights. In a week's time he was able to fly steadily for half an hour, and when he came home to the roof, he swooped down as gracefully as his parents. There was no more of that panicky beating of wings in order to balance himself as his feet touched the roof.

His parents, who had accompanied Gay-Neck in his preliminary flights, now began to leave him behind, and to fly much higher above him. For a while I thought that they were trying to make him fly still higher; for the son always made an effort to reach the level of his parents. Perhaps his elders were setting the little fellow a superb example. But at last, one day early in June, that explanation of mine was shaken by the following fateful incident. Gay-Neck was flying high: he looked half his usual size. Above him flew his parents, almost as small as a man's fist. They were circling above him with the regularity of a merry-go-round. It looked monotonous and meaningless. I removed my gaze from them; after all, it is not comfortable to look steadily upwards for long. As I lowered my eyes towards the horizon, they were held by a black spot moving swiftly, and growing larger every second. I wondered what sort of bird he was, coming at such a speed in a straight line, for in India birds are named in the Sanskrit, Turyak, or "curve-tracers."

But this one was coming straight, like an arrow. In another two minutes my doubts were dispelled. It was a hawk making for little Gay-Neck. I looked up and beheld a miraculous sight. His father was tumbling steadily down in order to reach his level, while his mother, bent on the same purpose, was making swift downward curves. Ere the terrible hawk had come within ten yards of the innocent little fellow, both his flanks were covered. Now the three flew downwards at a right angle from the path of their enemy. Undeterred by such a move, the hawk charged. At once the three pigeons made a dip that frustrated him, but the force with which he had made the attack was so great that it carried him a long distance beyond them. The pigeons kept on circling in the air with an ever-increasing downward trend. In another minute they were half-way to our roof. Now the hawk changed his mind. He went higher and higher into the sky: in fact, he flew so high that the pigeons could not hear the wind whistling in the feathers of his wings; and as he was above them they could not see their foe. Feeling that they were safe, they relaxed. It was evident that they were not flying so fast as before. Just then I saw that above them, way up, the hawk was folding his wings: he was about to drop, and in an instant he fell upon them like a stone. In desperation I put my fingers in my mouth and made a shrill whistle, a cry of warning. The pigeons dived like a falling sword, yet the hawk followed. Inch by inch, moment by moment he was gaining on them. Faster and faster he fell: now there were scarcely twenty feet between him and his prey. There was no doubt that he was aiming at Gay-Neck. I could see his sinister claws. "Won't those stupid pigeons do anything to save themselves?" I thought in an agony. He was so near him now—if they would only keep their heads, and—Just then they made a vast upward circle. The hawk followed. Then they flew on an even but large elliptical path. If a bird flies in a circle, he either tends to swing to the centre of that circle or away from it. Now the hawk missed their intention, and tended towards the centre, making a small circle inside their big one. No sooner was his back turned to them than the three pigeons made another dive, almost to our roof, but the sinister one was not to be deterred. He followed like a tongue of black lightning. His prey made a curving dive onto the roof, where they were safe at last under my wide spread arms! That instant I heard the shriek of the wind in the air; about a foot above my head the hawk flew by, his eyes blazing with yellow fire and his claws quivering like the tongue of a viper. As he passed I could hear the wind still whistling in his feathers.

After that narrow escape of my pet birds, I began to train Gay- Neck to a sense of direction. One day I took all three birds in a cage towards the east of our town. Exactly at nine in the morning I set them free. They came home safely. The next day I took them and equal distance to the west. Inside a week they knew the way to our house from within a radius of at least fifteen miles in any direction.

Since nothing ends smoothly in this world, the training of Gay- Neck finally met with a check. I had taken him and his parents down the Ganges in a boat. When we started, it was about six in the morning. The sky was littered with stray clouds, and a moderate wind was blowing from the south. Our boat was piled high with rice as white as snow on whose top were heaped mangoes red and golden in colour, like a white peak afire with the sunset.

I should have foreseen that such auspicious weather might turn suddenly into a terrible storm, for after all, boy though I was, I knew something about the freaks of the monsoon in June.

Hardly had we gone twenty miles before the first rain-clouds of the season raced across the sky. The velocity of the wind was so great that it ripped off one of the sails of our boat. Seeing that there was no time to be lost, I opened the cage and released the three pigeons. As they struck the wind, they vaulted right over and flew very low, almost falling into the water. They flew thus close to the surface of the river for a quarter of an hour, making very little headway against the hard wind. But they persisted, and another ten minutes saw them safely tacking and flying landward. Just about the time they had reached the string of villages on our left, the sky grew pitch black, a torrential cloudburst blotted everything out, and we saw nothing but inky sheets of water through which the lightning zigzagged and danced the dance of death. I gave up all hope of finding my pigeons again. We were almost shipwrecked ourselves, but fortunately our boat was beached on the shore of a village. Next morning, when I came home by train, I found two wet pigeons instead of three. Gay-Neck's father had perished in the storm. No doubt it was all my fault; and for the few days that followed, our house was given up to mourning. The two pigeons and I used to go up on the roof, whenever the rain left off a bit, in order to scan the sky for a glimpse of the father. Alas, he never returned.





Chapter Four Gay-Neck in the Himalayas


Since the rain and the heat in the plains proved excessive, my family decided to take us to the Himalayas. If you take a map of India, you will find that in its northeast corner is a town called Darjeeling, standing almost face to face with Mount Everest, the highest peak in the world. After travelling, not too fast, by caravan, several days from Darjeeling, my family, myself and my two pigeons reached the little village of Dentam. There we were ten thousand feet above sea-level. At such a height an American mountain or the Alps would have at least some snow, but in India, which is in the tropics, and on the Himalayas, hardly thirty degrees north of the equator, the snowline does not commence under ten thousand feet, and the jungle of the foot-hills, abounding with animals, is so cold after September that all its denizens migrate southwards.

Let me give you just a slight picture of our setting. Our house of stone and mud overlooked small valleys where tea was grown. Beyond, between serried ridges that struck out in harsh but majestic curves, were valleys full of rice-fields, maize, and fruit orchards. Farther on rose the dark evergreen-clad precipices over which reared thousands of feet of pure white ranges, the Kangchenjunga, the peak Makalu, and the Everest ranges. In the first flush of dawn they looked white; but as the light grew in brightness and the sun rose higher, peak after peak defined itself, not far off on the horizon, but piercing the very middle of the sky whence poured a flood of crimson light like the very blood of benediction.

One usually sees the Himalayas best in the early morning, for they are covered with clouds during the rest of the day. Hindus, who are religious people, get up in good time to behold the sublime hills and to pray to God. Can there be a better setting to prayers than those mountains most of whose peaks yet remain unexplored and untrodden by man? Their inviolate sanctity is something precious that remains a perpetual symbol of divinity. Heights like that of the Everest are symbols of the highest reality—GOD. They are symbolic of God's mystery, too, for with the exception of the early morning they are, as I have said, shrouded with clouds all day. Foreigners who come to India imagine they would like to see them all the time; but let no one complain, for he who has beheld Everest in its morning grandeur and awe-inspiring glory will say: "It is too sublime to be gazed at all day long. None could bear it continually before his eyes."

In July those early-morning views of the Everest are not vouchsafed us every day, for it is the month of rain. All the ranges lie in the grip of the most devastating blizzards. Once in a while, above the battle of storms and driven snow, the peaks appear—a compact mass of hard ice and white fire. They glow intensely in the sunlight, while at their feet the snow-clouds whirl and fall like fanatical dervishes dancing frenziedly before their terrible god.

During the summer my friend Radja and our teacher in jungle lore, old Ghond, came to visit our home. Radja was about sixteen years old, already a Brahmin priest, and Ghond we always called old, for none knew his age. Both Radja and I were handed over to that most competent of hunters for the purpose of studying under his guidance the secrets of jungle and animal life. Since I have described them in my other books, I need not repeat myself here.

As soon as we had settled down in Dentam, I began to train my pigeons in the art of direction. Whenever we had a clear day we climbed all the forenoon toward the higher peaks amid ilexes and balsam forests, and released our birds from some monastery roof or from the house of a nobleman. And towards evening, when we returned home, we invariably found Gay-Neck and his mother there before us.

We had hardly half a dozen clear days during the whole month of July, but under the guidance of the almost omniscient Ghond, and with my friend Radja, we travelled very far in a short time. We visited and stayed with all classes of the mountain folk, who looked much like Chinese. Their manners were elegant and their hospitality was generous. Of course, we took the pigeons with us, sometimes in a cage but most of the time under our tunics. Though we were frequently soaked with rain, Gay-Neck and his mother were religiously guarded from the weather.

Towards the end of July we made a journey beyond every lamasery (monastery) and baron's castle of Sikkim that we three human beings and the two pigeons had seen and known. We passed Singalila, where there was a nice little lamasery, on towards Phalut and the Unknown. At last we reached the homeland of the eagles. Around us were bare granite cliffs surrounded by firtrees and stunted pines; before us to the north lay the Kangchenjunga and the Everest ranges. Here, on the edge of an abyss, we released our two birds. In that exhilarating air they flew like children running from school at the end of the day. Gay-Neck's mother flew far upwards in order to show her son the sublime heights.

After the two birds had flown away, we three men talked of what they might be seeing as they sped above the altitudes. Before them, no doubt, rose the twin peaks of the Kangchenjunga group, slightly lower than Mount Everest but just as impeccable and austere as that immaculate peak untrodden still by the feet of men. That fact roused profound emotions in us. We saw the mountain in the distance, just for a few minutes, like a mirror before the Face of God, and I said to myself: "O thou summit of sanctity, thou inviolate and eternal, may no man tarnish thee, nor may any mortal stain thy purity even by his slightest touch. May thou remain forever unvanquished, O thou backbone of the universe, and measurement of immortality."

But I have brought you so high not to tell you about mountains, but of an adventure that befell us there. Now that Gay-Neck and his mother had flown, we gave up watching them and went in quest of an eagle's nest that was on a neighbouring cliff. The Himalayan eagle is brown with a soft golden glow, and though very beautiful to look at—it is in perfect proportion of beauty with strength—yet it is a fierce beast of prey.

But at first on this particular afternoon we encountered nothing savage. On the contrary, we found two fluffy white eaglets in an eyrie. They looked as engaging as new-born babes. The southern wind was blowing right in their eyes, but they did not mind it. It is in the nature of the Himalayan eagle to build his nest facing the direction of the wind. Why? No one knows. Apparently the bird likes to face that which he floats up on.

The younglings were nearly three weeks old, for they were already shedding their birthday cotton-like appearance, and had begun to grow real plumage. Their talons were sharp enough for their age, and their beaks hard and keen.

An eagle's eyrie is open and large. Its entrance-ledge—that is to say, landing-place—is about six or seven feet wide, and quite clean. But within, where it is dark and narrow, there is a perfect litter of twigs, branches, and a little of the hair and feathers of victims, every other part of their prey being devoured by the eaglets. The parents devour most of the bones, hair and feathers with the meat.

Though the surrounding country was clad in stunted pine trees, yet it was full of bird noises. Also, strange insects buzzed in the firtrees. Jewelled flies fluttered on blue wings over mauve orchids, and enormous rhododendrons glowed in sizes sometimes as large as the moon. Now and then a wild cat called, apparently talking in his noonday sleep.

Suddenly Ghond told us to run a dozen yards and hide in a bush. Hardly had we done so when the noises about us began to subside. In another sixty seconds the insects stopped their buzzing, the birds ceased to call, and even the trees seemed to grow still with expectation. In the air slowly rose the thin whistle of something. In a few moments it fell into a lower key. Hard upon it came a weird noise almost sounding like a shriek, and a giant bird flew down to the eagle's eyrie. The wind was still whistling in its wings. By its size Ghond thought it was the mother of the two babies. She remained still in the air till the eaglets withdrew into the inner recesses of their home. From her talons hung something well skinned, like a large rabbit. She landed, dropping her prey on the ledge. One could see that her wings from tip to tip measured half a dozen feet. She folded them as a man folds a paper; then, seeing that her children were coming towards her, she drew in her talons lest they pierce their unarmoured tender flesh. Now she hobbled like a cripple. The two little fellows ran and disappeared under her half-open wings, but they did not want to be brooded, for they were hungry. So she led them outwards to the dead rabbit, tore away some of its flesh, excluded any bone that clung to it, and gave it to them to swallow. Again, from below and all about, the insects and birds resumed their noises. We rose from our hiding and started homeward after Radja and I had extracted a promise from Ghond that he would bring us back later to see the full-fledged eaglets.

And so in a little over a month we returned. We brought with us Gay-Neck and his mother, for I wished the little fellow to fly the second time so that he would know with absolute certainty every village, lamasery, lake and river as well as the beasts, and the other birds—cranes, parrots, Himalayan herons, wild geese, divers, sparrow-hawks and swifts. On this trip we went about a hundred yards beyond the eagle's nest. The finger of autumn had already touched the rhododendrons. Their flaming petals were falling out; their long stems, many feet high, rustled in the winds. Leaves of many trees had begun to turn, and the air was full of melancholy. At about eleven, we uncaged our pigeons, who flew away into the sapphire sky that hung like a sail from the white peaks.

They had flown for about half an hour when a hawk appeared above them. It drew nearer the two pigeons and then drove at them. But the prey proved too wary; they escaped scatheless. Just as Gay- Neck and his mother were coming down swiftly to where the trees were, the hawk's mate appeared and attacked. She flew at them as her husband had done, without gaining her objective. Seeing that their prey was escaping, the male hawk cried shrilly to his mate; at that, she stopped in the air, just marking time. The pigeons, feeling safe, quickened their wing motion and flew southwards, while the two hawks followed, converging upon them from the east and the west. Wing-beat upon wing-beat, they gained on the pigeons. Their wings, shaped like a butcher's hatchet tipped off at the end, cut through the air like a storm… one, two, three—they fell like spears! Gay-Neck's mother stopped, and just floated in the air. That upset the calculation of the hawks. What to do now? Which one to fall upon? Such questioning takes time, and Gay-Neck seized the chance to change his course. Swiftly he rose higher and higher. In a few moments his example was followed by his mother, but she had lost time, and the hawks rose almost vaulting up to her. Then apparently a sudden panic seized her; she was afraid that the hawks were after her son, and in order to protect him—which was utterly unnecessary—she flew towards the two pursuers. In another minute both of those birds of prey had pounced upon her. The air was filled with a shower of feathers! The sight frightened Gay-Neck, who fell upon the nearest cliff for protection and safety. It was his mother's error that deprived her of her own life and probably imperiled that of her son.

We three human beings began a search for the cliff where Gay- Neck had fallen. It was no easy task, for the Himalayas are very treacherous. Pythons, if not tigers, were to be feared. Yet my friend Radja insisted, and Ghond the hunter agreed with him, saying that it would augment our knowledge.

We descended from the cliff that we were on and entered a narrow gorge where the raw bones lying on the ground convinced us that some beast of prey had dined on its victim the previous night. But we were not frightened, for our leader was Ghond, the most well-equipped hunter of Bengal. Very soon we began a laborious climb through clefts and crevices full of purple orchids on green moss. The odour of fir and balsam filled our nostrils. Sometimes we saw a rhododendron still in bloom. The air was cold and the climb unending. After two in the afternoon, having lunched on a handful of chola (dried beans softened in water), we reached the cliff where Gay-Neck was hiding. To our surprise we discovered that it was the eagle's nest with two eaglets—the babies of our previous visit—now full-fledged. They were sitting on the front ledge of their eyrie, while to our utter amazement we saw Gay-Neck at the farthest corner of a neighbouring ledge, cowering and weak. At our approach the eaglets came forward to attack us with their beaks. Radja, whose hand was nearest, received an awful stroke that ripped open the skin of his thumb, whence blood flowed freely. The eagles were between us and Gay-Neck, and there was nothing to be done but to climb over a higher cliff to reach him. Hardly had we gone six yards away from the nest when Ghond signed to us to hide as we had done the first time we had come. We did so with celerity, under a pine, and soon, with a soft roar in the air, one of the parent eagles drew near. In a few seconds there fell a high-pitched sound as the eagle sailed into its nest. A shiver of exquisite pleasure ran up and down my spine as her tail-feather grazed our tree and I heard that whistling mute itself.

Let me re-emphasize the fact that people who have an idea that the eagle builds its nest on an isolated, inaccessible cliff are mistaken. A powerful bird or beast does not have to be so careful in choosing its home. It can afford to be negligent. The nest of such a gigantic bird must have as its first requirement space so that it can open and shut its wings in the outer court of its home, and a place so spacious cannot be too inaccessible. Next, the eagle has no knack at building nests. It chooses a ledge that juts out of a cliff-cavern where nature has already performed two-thirds of the task. The last third is done by the birds themselves, and it merely consists in getting branches, leaves, and blades of grass together as a rough bed where the eggs may be laid and hatched.

All those details we gathered as we crawled out of our hiding place and examined—for the second time—the eyrie from a distance. There was no doubt that they were our old friends—the two babies—grown big, and their mother. She, even now though they were grown up, drew in her talons as a matter of habit lest they hurt her children. But it was momentary; after she had made sure that they were racing to meet her, she opened them and stood firmly on the outer ledge. The eaglets, though they should not be called so now that they were full-fledged, rushed forward and took shelter under her wide-spread wings. But the little beasts did not stay there long; they did not want to be loved; they were very hungry; they wanted something to eat, and alas, she had brought nothing. At that, they turned from her and sat facing the wind, waiting.

At Ghond's signal we all three rose and began to climb. In the course of another hour we had crawled in lizard-like silence over the roof of the eagles' nest. Just as I passed over it, an abominable odour of bones and drying flesh greeted my nostrils. That proved that the eagle—king of birds though he is—is not so clean and tidy as a pigeon. I, for one, prefer a pigeon's nest to an eagle's eyrie.

Soon we reached Gay-Neck and tried to put him in his cage. He was glad to see us, but fought shy of the cage. Since it was getting late, I gave him some lentils to eat. Just about the middle of his meal, seeing him deeply absorbed in eating, I made an effort to grab him with my hand. That frightened the poor bird, and he flew away. The noise of his flight brought the mother eagle out of the inner recess of her nest. She looked out, her beak quivering and her wings almost opening for flight. At once all the jungle noises below were stilled, and she sailed away. We felt that all was over for Gay-Neck. Suddenly a shadow fell upon him. I thought it was the eagle pouncing; however, it rested on him only a moment and then receded, but he had had the fright of his life, and he flew away, driven by sheer terror, in a zigzag course, far beyond our sight.

I was convinced that we had lost Gay-Neck. But Ghond insisted that we would find the bird in a day or two, so we decided to wait and spend our time there.

Night came on apace, and we sought shelter under some pines. The next morning we were told by Ghond that the day had come for the young eagles to fly. He concluded: "Eagles never give their children lessons in flight. They know when their eaglets are ready for it. Then the parents leave for ever."

All that day the parent eagle did not re-visit her nest. When night came again her children gave up all hope of her return, and withdrew into the inner part of their home. It proved a memorable night for us. We were so far up that we were quite sure of no attack by a four-footed beast of prey. Tigers and leopards go downwards, not that they fear the heights, but because, like all animals, they follow their food. Antelopes, deer, water buffalo and wild boars graze where valleys and jungle-growth are plentiful, and since they go where grass, sapling, luscious twigs, in short, their dinner, grows on riverbanks, those who live by eating them search for them there. That is why, with the exception of birds and a few animals such as wild cats, pythons and snow leopards, the heights are free of beasts of prey. Even the yak, who takes the place of the cow, does not climb so high very frequently or in large numbers. One or two mountain goats one sees occasionally, but nothing larger, and so our night was free of any dramatic experience. But this was amply compensated for by the piercing cold that possessed and shook our bodies in the early dawn. Sleep was out of the question, so I sat up, and wrapping all the blankets of my bedding around me, watched and listened. The stillness was intense—like a drum whose skin had been so stretched that even breathing on it would make it groan. I felt hemmed in by the piercing soundlessness from every direction. Now and then, like an explosion, came the crackling of some dry autumn leaves as a soft-footed wild cat leaped on them from the branch of a tree not far away. That sound very soon sank like a stone in the ever-rising tide of stillness. Slowly, one by one, the stars set. The rising tide of mystery that was reigning everywhere deepened, when like the shaking of lances something shivered in the eagles' eyrie. There was no doubt now that the day was breaking. Again rose the same sound from the same place. The eagles were preening their wings as a man stretches himself before fully waking from sleep. Now I could hear a rustle near by that I thought must be the two eagles coming forward on the front ledge of their nest. Soon came other noises. Storks flew by overhead; strange birds like cranes shouldered the sky. And near by the bellow of a yak tore the stillness asunder as if he had put his horn through the skin of a drum. Far down, birds called one another. At last fell a white light on the Kangchenjunga Range. Then Makalu appeared with an immense halo of opal back of his head. The lower ranges, as high as Mont Blanc, put on their vesture of milk-white glory; shapes and colours of stone and tree leaped into sight. Orchids trembled with morning dew. Now the sun, like a lion, leaped on the shoulder of the sky, and the snow-bastioned horizons bled with scarlet fire.

Ghond and Radja, who were already awake, stood up; then the latter, a well-trained priest, chanted the Sanskrit Vedic prayer to Savitar—the Sun:





O thou blossom of eastern silence,

Take thy ancient way untrodden of men.

Go on thy dustless path of mystery,

Reach thou the golden throne of God,

And be our advocate

Before His Silence and His compassionate speechlessness.





The prayer frightened the eagles, unaccustomed to human voices. But ere they were excited to fury, our little ritual was over and we hid ourselves under the stunted pine. The eagles, left without any breakfast, looked out and scanned the sky for a sign of their parent. They gazed below where flocks of parrots and jays flew, as small as humming-birds. Wild geese came trailing across the snowy peaks where they had spent the night on their journey southwards. Soon they too grew as small as beetles, and melted into space. Hour after hour passed, yet no sight of the big eagle! The full-fledged eaglets felt hungrier and hungrier, and began to fret in their nest. We heard a quarrel going on in the interior of the eyrie that grew in intensity and noise till one of them left home in disgust and began to climb the cliff. He went higher and higher. Up and up he walked without using his wings. By now it was past midday; we had luncheon, yet still there was no sight of the parent birds. We judged that the eagle left in the nest was the sister, for she looked smaller than the other eaglet. She sat facing the wind, peering into the distance, but she too grew downhearted. Strange though it may sound, I have yet to see a Himalayan eagle that does not sit facing the wind from the time of its birth until it learns to fly, as a sailor boy might sit looking at the sea until he takes to navigating it. About two in the afternoon, that eagle grew tired of waiting in the nest. She set out in quest of her brother, who was now perching on the top of a cliff far above. He too was facing the wind. As his sister came up, his eyes brightened. He was glad not to be alone, and the sight of her saved him from the melancholy thought of flying for food. No eagle-child have I seen being taught to fly by its parents. That is why younglings will not open their wings until driven by hunger. The parent eagles know this very well, and that is why when their babies grow up, and the time has come, they leave them and go away.

The little sister, laboriously climbed till she reached her brother's side, but alas, there was no room for two. Instead of balancing themselves on their perch, the sister's weight knocked her brother almost over. Instantly he opened his wings wide. The wind bore him up. He stretched out his talons, but too late to reach the ground. He was at least two feet up in the air already, so he flapped his wings and rose a little higher. He dipped his tail—which acted like a rudder, and swung him sideways, east, south, east. He swung over us, and we could hear the wind crooning in his wings. Just at that moment a solemn silence fell on everything; the noises of insects stopped; rabbits, if there were rabbits, hid in their holes. Even the leaves seemed to listen in silence to the wing-beats of this new monarch of the air as he sailed higher and higher. And he had to go way up, for only by going very far could he find what he sought. Sometimes eighteen hundred to three thousand feet below him, an eagle sees a hare hopping about on the ground. Then he folds his wings and roars down the air like lightning. The terrible sound of his coming almost hypnotizes the poor creature, and holds him bound to the spot, listening to his enemy's thunderous approach, and then the eagle's talons pierce him.

Seeing her brother go off in this way, and being afraid of loneliness, the sister suddenly spread her wings too. The wind blowing from under threw her up. She also floated in the air and tacked her flight by her tail towards her comrade, and in a few minutes both were lost to sight. Now it was our turn to depart from those hills in search of our pigeon. He might have gone to Dentam. But it behooved us to search every lamasery and baronial castle that had served Gay-Neck as a landmark in his past flights.





Chapter Five On Gay-Neck's Track


As we descended into the bleak oblivion of the gorges below, we suddenly found ourselves in a world of deepening dark, though it was hardly three in the afternoon. It was due to the long shadows of the tall summits under which we moved. We hastened our pace, and the cold air goaded us on. As soon as we had descended about a thousand feet and more, it grew warmer by comparison, but as night came on apace the temperature dropped anew and drove us to seek shelter in a friendly lamasery. We reached that particular serai where the lamas, Buddhist monks, most generously offered us hospitality. They spoke to us only as they had occasion in serving us with supper and in escorting us to our rooms. They spend their evenings in meditation.

We had three small cells cut out of the side of a hill, in front of which was a patch of grassy lawn railed off at the outer edges. By the light of the lanthorns we carried, we found that we had only straw mattresses in our stone cells. However, the night passed quickly, for we were so tired that we slept like children in their mothers' arms. About four o'clock next morning I heard many footsteps that roused me completely from sleep. I got out of bed and went in their direction, and soon I discerned bright lights. By climbing down and then up a series of high steps, I reached the central chapel of the lamasery—a vast cave under an overhanging rock, and open on three sides. There before me stood eight lamas with lanthorns that they quietly put away as they then sat down to mediate, their legs crossed under them. The dim light fell on their tawny faces and blue robes, and revealed on their countenances only peace and love.

Presently their leader said to me in Hindustani: "It has been our practise for centuries to pray for all who sleep. At this hour of the night even the insomnia-stricken person finds oblivion; and since men when they sleep cannot possess their conscious thoughts, we pray that Eternal Compassion may purify them, so that when they awake in the morning they will begin their day with thoughts that are pure, kind and brave. Will you mediate with us?"

I agreed readily. We sat praying for compassion for all mankind. Even to this day, when I awake early I think of those Buddhist monks in the Himalayas praying for the cleansing of the thoughts of all men and women still asleep.

The day broke soon enough. I found that we were sitting in a cleft of a mountain, and at our feet lay a precipice sheer and stark. The tinkling of silver bells rose softly in the sunlit air; bells upon bells, silver and golden, chimed gently and filled the air with their sweet music: it was the monks' greeting to the harbinger of light. The sun rose as a clarion cry of triumph—of Light over Darkness, and of Life over Death.

Below, I met Radja and Ghond at breakfast. It was then that a monk who served us said, "Your pigeon came here for shelter yesterday." He gave a description of Gay-Neck, accurate even to the nature of his nose-wattle, its size and colour.

Ghond asked, "How do you know we seek a pigeon?"

The flat-faced lama, without even turning an eye-lash, said in a matter-of-fact tone, "I can read your thoughts."

Radja questioned with eagerness: "How can you read our thoughts?"

The monk answered: "If you pray to Eternal Compassion for four hours a day for the happiness of all that live, in the course of a dozen years, He gives you the power to read some people's thoughts, especially the thoughts of those who come here.… Your pigeon we fed and healed of his fear when he took shelter with us."

"Healed of fear, my Lord!" I exclaimed.

The lama affirmed most simply: "Yes, he was deeply frightened. So I took him in my hands and stroked his head and told him not to be afraid; then yestermorn I let him go. No harm will come to him."

"Can you give your reason for saying so, my Lord?" asked Ghond politely.

The man of God replied to him thus: "You must know, O Jewel amongst hunters, that no animal, nor any man, is attacked and killed by an enemy until the latter succeeds in frightening him. I have seen even rabbits escape hounds and foxes when they kept themselves free of fear. Fear clouds one's wits and paralyses one's nerve. He who allows himself to be frightened lets himself be killed."

"But how do you heal a bird of fear, my Lord?"

To that question of Radja's the holy one answered: "If you are without fear, and you keep not only your thoughts pure but also your sleep untainted of any fear-laden dreams for months, then whatever you touch will become utterly fearless. Your pigeon now is without fear, for I who held him in my hand have not been afraid in thought, deed and dream for nearly twenty years. At present your pet bird is safe: no harm will come to him."

By the calm conviction in his words, spoken without emphasis, I felt that in truth Gay-Neck was safe; and in order to lose no more time, I said farewell to the devotees of Buddha and started south. Let me say that I firmly believe that the lamas were right. If You pray for other people every morning, you can enable them to begin their day with thoughts of purity, courage and love.

Now we dropped rapidly towards Dentam. Our journey lay through places that grew hotter and more familiar. No more did we see the rhododendrons. The autumn that farther up had touched the leaves of trees with crimson, gold, cerise and copper was not so advanced here. The cherry trees still bore their fruits; the moss had grown on trees thickly, and the wind had blown on them the pollen of orchids, large as the palm of your hand, blossoming in purple and scarlet. Many white daturas perspired with dewdrops in the steaming heat of the sun. The trees began to appear taller and more terrible. Bamboos soared upwards like sky-piercing minarets. Creepers as thick as pythons beset our path. The buzzing of the cicada grew insistent and unbearable, and jays jabbered in the woods. Now and then a flock of green parrots flung their emerald glory in the face of the sun, then vanished. Insects multiplied. Mammoth butterflies, velvety black, swarmed from blossom to blossom, and innumerable small birds preyed on numberless buzzing flies. We were stung with the sharpest stings of worms, and now and then we had to wait to let pass a serpent that crossed our path. Were it not for the practised eyes of Ghond, who knew which way the animals came and went, we would have been killed ten times over by a snake or a buffalo. Sometimes Ghond would put his ear to the ground, and listen. After several minutes he would say: "Ahead of us, buffalos are coming. Let us wait till they pass." And soon enough we would hear their sharp hoofs moving through the undergrowth with a sinister noise as if a vast scythe were cutting, cutting, cutting the very ground from under our feet. Yet we pressed on, stopping for half an hour for lunch. At last we reached the borders of Sikkim, whose small valley glimmered with ripening red millet, green oranges and golden bananas, set against hillsides glittering with marigolds above which softly shone the violets.

Just then we came to a sight that I shall never forget. At our feet on the narrow caravan road the air burned in iridescence: the heat was so great that it vibrated with colours. Hardly had we gone a few yards when like a thunderclap rose a vast flock of Himalayan pheasants; then they flew into the jungle, their wings burning like peacocks' plumes in the warm air. We kept on moving. In another couple of minutes flew up another flock but these were mud coloured birds. In my perplexity I asked Ghond for an explanation.

He said: "Do you not see, O Beloved of Felicity, the caravan that passed here was loaded with millet? One of their sacks had a hole in it. A few handfuls of millet leaked out on the road before the sack was sewn up. Later on arrived these birds, and fed themselves here. We came upon them suddenly and frightened them to flight."

"But, O Diadem of Wisdom," I asked, "why do the males look so gorgeous and why are the females mud-coloured? Is nature always partial to the male?"

Ghond made the following explanation: "It is said that Mother Nature has given all birds the colours that hide them from their enemies. But do you not see that those pheasants are so full of splendour that they can be sighted and killed even by a blind man?"

Radja exclaimed, "Can they?"

Ghond answered: "O, wary beyond thy years, no! The real reason is that they live on trees, and do not come down before the earth is very hot. In this hot India of ours the air two inches above the ground is so burning that it quivers with a thousand colours; and the plumage of the pheasant is similar. When we look at them we do not see birds, but the many-coloured air that camouflages them completely. We almost walked on them a few moments ago, thinking them but a part of the road at our feet."

"That I comprehend," resumed Radja reverently. "But why did the female look mud-coloured and why did they not fly away with the male?"

Ghond answered without hesitation: "When the enemy approaches and takes them by surprise, the male flies up to face the enemy's bullets, though without thought of chivalry. The females' wings are not so good. Besides, she, being of the colour of the earth, opens her wings to shelter her babies under them, then lies flat on the ground, completely melting away her identity into that colour scheme. After the enemy goes away in quest of the corpses of their already slaughtered husbands, the females run away with their babies into the nearest thicket.… And if it is not too late in the year, and if their grown-up babies are not with them, the mother birds singly flop to the ground and lie there, making the gesture of protecting their young. Self-sacrifice becomes a habit with them, and habitually they put forth their wings whether they have any young ones with them or not. That is what they were doing when we came upon them; then suddenly they realized that they were without anyone to protect, and as we still kept on coming down upon them they took to flight, poor fliers though they are."

With the approach of dusk we took shelter in the house of a Sikkimese nobleman whose son was a friend of ours. There we found further traces of Gay-Neck, who had been to their house many times before, and so when he reached the familiar place on his latest visit he had eaten millet seeds, drunk water and taken his bath. Also, he had preened his wings and left two small azure feathers that my friend had preserved for the sake of their colouring. When I saw them my heart leaped in joy, and that night I slept in utter peace and contentment. There was another reason for sleeping well, for Ghond had told us to rest deeply, as after the following day's march we were to spend the night in the jungle.

The next night, when we sat on that tree-top in the deep jungle, often did I think of the home of my Sikkimese friend and its comforts.

Imagine yourself marching all day, then spending the night on a vast banyan tree in the very heart of a dangerous forest! It took us a little over half an hour to find that tree, for banyans do not often grow in high altitudes, and also the same reason that made us choose the banyan made us look for a very large one of its kind—it would be of no use to us if it were slender enough for an elephant to break down by walking backwards against it! That is how the pachyderm destroys some very stout trees. We looked for something tall, and so stout that no elephant could reach its upper branches with his trunk and not even two tuskers could break it by pushing against it with their double weight.

At last we found a tree to our liking. Radja stood on Ghond's shoulder, and I on Radja's, until we reached branches as thick as a man's torso. I climbed and sat on one of them and from it let down our rope ladder that we always carried in the jungle for emergencies such as the present one. Radja climbed up and sat near me; then Ghond ascended the branch and sat between us. Now we saw that below us where Ghond had stood it had not only grown dark as the heart of a coal-mine, but there glowed two green lights set very close to each other. We knew too well whose they were. Ghond exclaimed jovially, "Had I been delayed down there two extra minutes, the striped fellow would have killed me."

Seeing that his prey had escaped him, the tiger gave a thunderous yell, scourging the air like a curse. At once a tense silence fell, and smothered all the noise of insects and little beasts, and it descended further and deeper until it sank into the earth and seemed to grip the very roots of the trees.

We made ourselves secure on our perch, and Ghond passed the extremely flexible rope ladder around his waist, then Radja's, then mine, fastening the rest of it around the main trunk of the tree. We tested it by letting it bear the weight of one of us at a time. This precaution was taken for the purpose of preventing a sleep-stricken member of our group from slipping down to the floor of the jungle, for after all, in sleep the body relaxes so that it falls like a stone. Finally, Ghond arranged his arms for pillows for our heads when slumber came.

Now that we had taken all the necessary precautions, we concentrated our attention on what was happening below. The tiger had vanished from under our tree. The insects had resumed their song, which was again and again stilled for a few seconds as huge shapes fell from far-off trees with soft thuds. Those were leopards and panthers who had slept on the trees all day and were now leaping down to hunt at night.

When they had gone the frogs croaked, insects buzzed continually and owls hooted. Noise, like a diamond, opened its million facets. Sounds leaped at one's hearing like the dart of sunlight into unprotected eyes. A boar passed, cracking and breaking all before him. Soon the frogs stopped croaking, and way down on the floor of the jungle we heard the tall grass and other undergrowth rise like a haycock, then with a sigh fall back. That soft sinister sigh like the curling up of spindrift drew nearer and nearer, then … it slowly passed our tree. Oh, what a relief! It was a constrictor going to the water-hole. We stayed on our tree-top as still as its bark— Ghond was afraid that our breathing might betray our position to the terrible python.

A few minutes later we heard one or two snappings of small twigs almost as faint as a man cracking his fingers. It was a stag whose antlers had got caught in some vines, and he was snapping them to get himself freed. Hardly had he passed when the jungle grew very tense with expectation. Sounds began to die down. Out of the ten or a dozen different noises that we had heard all at once, there now remained only three: the insects' tick tack tock, the short wail of the stag—no doubt the constrictor was strangling him near the water-hole—and the wind overhead. Now the elephants were coming. Hatis (elephants), about fifty in a herd, came and played around the place below us. The squeal of the females, the grunt of the males, and the run run run of the babies filled the air.

I do not remember what happened next, for I had dozed off into a sort of waking sleep, and in that condition I heard myself talking pigeon-language to Gay-Neck. I was experiencing a deep confusion of sleep and dream. Someone shook and roused me. To my utter amazement Ghond whispered: "I cannot hold you any more. Wake up! Mischief is abroad. A mad elephant has been left behind. The straggler is bent on harm. We are not high enough to be altogether out of the reach of his trunk, and if he raises it far enough he will scent our presence. Wild elephants hate and fear man, and once he gets our odour he may stay about here all day in order to find out where we are. Rouse thy vigilance, lad. Draw the blade of alertness before the enemy strikes."

There was no mistake about that elephant. In the pale light of early dawn I could discern a sort of hillock darkly moving about under our tree. He was going from tree to tree and snapping off a few succulent twigs that autumn had not yet blighted. He seemed greedy and bent on gorging himself with those delicacies, rare for the time of the year. In about half an hour he performed a strange trick, putting his fore-feet on the bole of a thick tree, and swinging up his trunk. It gave him the appearance of a far-spreading mammoth; with that enormously long reach he almost touched the top of the tree, and twisted the most delectable branches off its boughs. After having denuded it of its good twigs, he came to a tree next to ours, and there did the same thing. Now he found a slender tree that he pulled down with his trunk, and placed his fore-feet on the poor bent thing and broke it with a crash under his own weight. He ate all that he could of that one. While he was breakfasting thus, his rampage frightened the birds and monkeys, who flew in the air or ran from tree to tree jabbering in terror. Then the elephant put his feet on the stump of the broken tree and reached up into ours until he touched the branch on which we sat. Hardly had he done so when he squealed, for the odour of man all beasts fear, and swiftly withdrew his trunk. After grunting and complaining to himself, he put up his trunk again very near Ghond's face. Just then Ghond sneezed almost into the elephant's nostrils. That struck panic into the latter's heart; he felt beleaguered by men. Trumpeting and squealing like a frightened fiend, he dashed through the jungle, breaking and smashing everything before him. Again the parrots, thick as green sails, flew in the sky. Monkeys screamed and raced from tree to tree. Boars and stags stampeded on the floors of the jungle. For a while the din and tumult reigned unchecked. We had to wait some time before we dared to descend from our perch in order to resume our homeward journey.

Late that day we reached home after being carried on horseback by a caravan that we were fortunate enough to meet. All three of us were dead tired, but we forgot our fatigue when we beheld Gay- Neck in his nest in our house at Dentam. Oh, what joy! That evening, before I went to sleep, I thought of the calm, quiet assurance of the lama who said, "Your bird is safe."





Chapter Six Gay-Neck's Truancy


But the day after our return Gay-Neck flew away again, in the morning, and failed to put in an appearance later. We waited for him most anxiously during four successive days, and then, unable to bear the suspense any longer, Ghond and I set out in search of him, determined to find him, dead or alive. This time we hired two ponies to take us as far as Sikkim. We had made sure of our path by asking people about Gay-Neck in each village that we had to pass through. Most of them had seen the bird, and some of them gave an accurate description of him: one hunter had seen him in a lamasery nesting next to a swift under the eaves of the house; another, a Buddhist monk, said that he had seen him near their monastery in Sikkim on a river-bank where wild ducks had their nest, and in the latest village that we passed through on the second afternoon we were told that he was seen in the company of a flock of swifts.

Led by such good accounts we reached the highest table-land of Sikkim and were forced to bivouac there the third night. Our ponies were sleepy, and so were we, but after what seemed like an hour's sleep, I was roused by a tenseness that had fallen upon everything. I found the two beasts of burden standing stiff; in the light of the fire and that of the risen half-moon I saw that their ears were raised tensely in the act of listening carefully. Even their tails did not move. I too listened intently. There was no doubt that the silence of the night was more than mere stillness; stillness is empty, but the silence that beset us was full of meaning, as if a God, shod with moonlight, was walking so close that if I were to put out my hand I could touch his garment.

Just then the horses moved their ears as if to catch the echo of a sound that had moved imperceptibly through the silence. The great deity had gone already; now a queer sensation of easing the tense atmosphere set in. One could feel even the faintest shiver of the grass, but that too was momentary; the ponies now listened for a new sound from the north. They were straining every nerve in the effort. At last even I could hear it. Something like a child yawning in his sleep became audible. Stillness again followed. Then a sighing sound, long drawn out, ran through the air, and sank lower and lower, like a thick green leaf slowly sinking through calm water. Then rose a murmur on the horizon as if someone were praying against the sky-line. About a minute later the horses relaxed their ears and switched their tails, and I, too, felt myself at ease. Lo! Thousands of geese were flying through the upper air. They were at least four thousand feet above us, but all the same the ponies had heard their coming long before I did.

The flight of the geese told us that dawn was at hand, and I sat up and watched. The stars set one by one. The ponies began to graze. I gave them more rope; now that the night had passed, they did not need to be tied so close to the fire.

In another ten minutes the intense stillness of the dawn held all things in its grip, and that had its effect on our two beasts. This time I could clearly see both of them lifting their heads and listening. What sounds were they trying to catch? I did not have long to wait. In a tree not far off a bird shook itself; then another did the same thing, on another bough. One of them sang. It was a song-sparrow, and its cry roused all nature. Other song-sparrows trilled; then other birds, and still others! By now shapes and colours were coming to light with blinding rapidity. Thus passed the short tropical twilight, and Ghond got up to say his prayers.

That day our wanderings brought us to the lamasery near Singalila of which I have spoken before. The lamas were glad to give us all the news of Gay-Neck. They informed me that the previous afternoon Gay-Neck and the flock of swifts who nested under the eaves of the monastery had flown southwards.

Again with the blessings of the lamas we said farewell to their hospitable serai, and set out on Gay-Neck's trail. The mountains burned like torches behind us as we bestowed on them our last look. Before us lay the autumn-tinted woods glimmering in gold, purple, green and cerise.





Chapter Seven Gay-Neck's Story


In the preceding chapter I made scanty references to the places and incidents through which Gay-Neck was recovered. Ghond found his track with certainty the first day of our ten days' search for him, but in order to see those things clearly and continuously, it would be better to let Gay-Neck tell his own Odyssey. It is not hard for us to understand him if we use the grammar of fancy and the dictionary of imagination.

The October noon when we boarded the train at Darjeeling for our return journey to town, Gay-Neck sat in his cage, and commenced the story of his recent truancy from Dentam to Singalila and back.

"O master of many tongues, O wizard of all languages human and animal, listen to my tale. Listen to the stammering, wandering narrative of a poor bird. Since the river has its roots in the hill, so springs my story from the mountains.

"When near the eagles' nest I heard and beheld the wicked hawk's talons tear my mother to pieces, I was so distressed that I decided to die, but not by the claws of those treacherous birds. If I was to be served up for a meal, let it be to the king of the air; so I went and sat on the ledge near the eagles' nest, but they would do me no harm. Their house was in mourning. Their father had been trapped and killed, and their mother was away hunting for pheasants and hares. Since up to now the younglings had eaten only what had been killed for them, they dared not attack and finish poor me who was alive. I do not know yet why no eagle has harmed me; during the past days I have seen many.

"Then you came to catch and cage me. As I was in no mood for human company, I flew away, taking my chances as I went, but I remembered places and persons who were your friends and I stayed with them on my way south to Dentam. During those two days—for I flew only two days—I was attacked by a newly fledged hawk, and I gave him the best defeat of his life. It was in this wise; one morning as I was flying over the woods below Sikkim, I heard the wind screech overhead. I knew what that meant now, so I played a trick. I stopped all of a sudden, and the hawk, who was falling upon me, missed me and fell way down, grazing his wing on a tree-top. I rose higher and flew fast, but he caught up, and then I began to make circles in the air. I rose high, oh, so high that my lungs could not breathe the air there, and I had to come down again.

"But no sooner had I descended than with an ominous screech and cry the hawk fell upon me. Fortunately, then and there, for the first time in my life I tried to tumble as I had seen my father do, and I succeeded in making a double tumble, then shooting up like a fountain. Again the hawk missed and rose to attack, but I gave him no chance. I flew at him. And just as I was passing him, he dipped down, then up, and clutched at me; again I tumbled, striking him so hard that he lost his balance. I do not know what happened, but that very moment I felt something sucking me down, down to the depth of the earth. My wings were powerless. I fell as an eagle falls—heavy and inevitable—striking the hawk on the head with my full weight. I think the blow stunned him. He too fell, and was lost in the woods below, but I was glad to find myself on the branch of an ilex tree.

"I had been sucked down by an air current. Since that first experience of mine, I have met many others like it, but I have never understood why it was that above certain trees and streams the air gets very cold and makes a current that draws into itself the bird that strikes it. I had to learn the lesson of flying in those currents after being whirled up and down by them. But I do not hate them, since the first air current I encountered saved my life.

"Sitting on that ilex tree, I became so hungry that it drove me to fly home. Luckily, no soulless hawk obstructed my arrow-like flight.

"But my successful escape from that newly fledged murderer gave me back my courage, and as soon as you came home I said to myself: 'Now that he, my friend, has seen me alive, he will not worry about me. I must fly anew through the falcon-infested air and test my courage.'

"Now began my real Odyssey. I went northwards to the eagles' nest, and stopped at the lamasery where a holy man had blessed me on an earlier occasion. There I re-visited Mr. and Mrs. Swift, my old friends. Moving farther north, I went past Singalia at last and reached the eyrie of the eagles who had flown away. So I made myself comfortable there, but not too happy, for the eagles leave all kinds of refuse in their nests, and I am afraid they swarm with vermin. Though I spent my day in the eagles' nest, I decided to spend the night in a tree, free from horrid insects. After a couple of days, my going in and out of the eyrie gave me great prestige among other birds. They feared me, perhaps because they took me for a sort of eagle. Even the hawks began to give me a wide berth. That gave me all the confidence that I needed, so early one morning, seeing a white wedge of birds coming south, flying very high, I joined them. They did not mind my joining them; they were wild geese going towards Ceylon and beyond, in the quest of a sunny ocean.

"Those geese, after two hours' flight, as the day became warmer, descended onto a rapid mountain stream. Unlike the eagles, they rarely looked downwards, but watched the horizon lines. They spied a little ribbon of whitish-blue far off against the sky, and flew in a slowly declining straight line till it seemed as if the earth were rising to meet us, and soon all plunged into the silver stream, for now the waters looked more silvery than blue. They floated on the water, but as I knew that I was not web-footed, I sat on a tree and watched their antics. You know how flat and ugly the bills of geese are, but now I saw the reason for it. They used them like pincers on things such as shells that grew on the side of the banks. Every now and then a goose would put his bill on a plant or a shell, then wring it out of position as a butcher would wring a duck's neck. After that it would devour its victim wholesale, crushing it in its powerful throat, but ere it passed very far down its size dwindled to nothing. I saw one fellow do worse than that. He found a fish—as lean as a water-snake—in a hole under the bank; he began to pull it. The more he pulled, the thinner and longer it got. Slowly, after a terrific tug of war, the poor fellow was dragged from his hole. Then the goose hopped up the shore and flung it on the ground. His bill had crushed the part it had held onto, nearly into pulp, so no wonder his wriggling victim was already dead. Then from nowhere walked up to him another goose. (By the way, are not geese the most ungainly birds when they are not flying or swimming? On the water they resemble dreams floating on pools of sleep, but on land they hobble like cripples on crutches!) By now the two geese were quarrelling. They pulled each other's feathers; they slapped with their wings; they kicked each other with their feet every time they hopped up above the ground. While they were thus engaged, oblivious of their bone of contention, a cat-like creature, probably an otter, pounced from among the reeds, grabbed the dead eel, and vanished. Now the geese declared a truce, but too late! Oh, they have no more sense than, well—geese! Compared with them, we pigeons seem paragons of cleverness.

"After they had stopped fighting, the chief goose cried—'Cluck, caw, caw, caw!' That instant all of them paddled hard to gather momentum. A few extra wing-beats and they were in the air. How beautiful they looked now! That soft soughing of vast wings, their necks and bodies like drawings against the sky, making a severe eye pleasing wedge. I shall never forget it.

"But every flock has its straggler. One fellow was left behind, because he was still struggling with a fish. At last he secured it, and flew up in quest of a tree where he could eat it under cover. Suddenly from the empty air an enormous hawk attacked him. The goose rose higher, but the indefatigable hawk did not relent. Up and up they circled, screaming and quacking. Suddenly a faint but clear echo of a honk was heard. The chief of the flock was calling the straggler; that distracted him. Hardly knowing what he was doing, he honked back an answer. That instant the fish fell from his mouth. It began to fall like a leaf. The hawk dipped, and just as he was going to pierce it with his talons, down the air came a surge and roar. In a trice an eagle fell as a rock falls down a high precipice. That hawk ran for his life, and that gave me a great deal of pleasure to behold.

"Under the eagle's two wings like vast sails, the talons forked out lightning fashion and grabbed the fish—then the monarch of the air in his shining armour of brown gold sailed away, the wind ruffling the feathers above his knees. Far away, the hawk was still running for his life!

"I am glad he went very far away, for I had to fly about in quest of a caravan road where I could get some seeds dropped by men. I soon found some, and after a tolerably decent meal I perched on a tree and went to sleep. When I woke it was mid-afternoon. I decided to fly way up, to reach the blessed lamasery, and visit my friends the swifts. My flight was unattended by any mishap, for I had learned to fly carefully by now. I generally went very far up and looked down, as well as at the horizon. Though I have not so long a neck as a wild goose, yet I turned and took side glances every few minutes in order to make sure that nothing was attacking my rear.

"I reached the monastery just in time, as the lamas were getting ready to stand on the edge of their chapel in order to pour benediction upon the world during sunset. Mr. and Mrs. Swift were flying near the nest where their three youngsters were put to bed. Of course, they were glad to receive me. After their vesper services, the monks fed me, and the sweet old lama said something about a blessing that someone called Infinite Compassion had put upon me. Then I flew from his hand feeling absolutely fearless. In that state of mind and body I entered my nest next to the swifts under the eaves of the lamasery.

"The nights in October are cold. In the morning, while the priests rang their bells, the little swifts flew about for exercise while their parents and I had to fly to shake off the chill of the morning. That day I spent there in order to help them make preparations for their journey south. I was surprised to learn that they intended to build a nest in Ceylon or Africa whither they were going. They explained to me that a swift's nest is not at all any easy thing to construct. Then in order to assuage my thirst for knowledge, they told me how they erect their homes."





Chapter Eight Gay-Neck's Odyssey (continued)


"In order to make clear to you the swift's skill at architecture, let me first of all draw attention to the swift's handicaps. He has a small beak fit for catching flying insects. His mouth is very wide to enable him to catch his prey while he is on the wing. Very few insects can escape his wide-open mouth as he comes down on them. As he is very small, Mr. Swift cannot lift much weight. No wonder his house is built out of slender materials such as straw and twigs of trees no thicker than a middle-sized needle.

"The first time I saw a swift he looked paralysed and deformed. All swifts know that they have wretched legs. The bird has hardly any legs to balance upon. His small feet like fish-hooks, made for sticking on to places, emerge right out of his body; his little hook like claws seem inflexible. He has not enough leg between his body and his feet, and this deprives him of the springiness that longer legs supply to other birds. No wonder he cannot hop or jump. But that defect is squared by his one advantage—he can cling to stone palisades, marble eaves, and alabaster friezes of houses as no other bird can. I have seen my friend Swift hang on to polished walls as if they were corrugated surfaces.

"Under these handicaps, all he can do is to choose holes in walls just under the eaves for his home. But there he cannot lay his eggs, for they would roll off. So he catches flying straws and small falling leaves, and glues them to the stone floor of his nest with his saliva. That is the secret of his skill at architecture. His saliva is wonderful; it dries and hardens like the best glue of the cabinet-makers. When the nest is made ready, the long white eggs are laid. Among the swifts, women are not so emancipated as among the pigeons. Our women enjoy equal rights with men, but the female swift has always the larger part of the work to do. For instance, Mr. Swift never sits on the eggs; he lets his wife do it. Occasionally he brings her food during the day, but otherwise he spends all his waking hours visiting male swifts whose wives are similarly occupied. I told my friend Swift he ought to copy the pigeons and give more freedom to his wife, but he seemed to think this a pet joke of mine.

"At last our preparations were made, and one fine autumn morning the five swifts and I set out in a southerly direction, piloted by Mr. Swift. We never went in a straight line, but zigzagged east or west, though we held to a general southern course. The swifts eat flies and gnats that float on rivers and lakes. They go about fifty miles an hour—a blinding speed for a small bird—and do not like woods because while their gaze is fixed downwards in search of insects, they may break their wings on a tree. They prefer open clear spaces above the waters, and with their scythelike long wings they cleave the air as swiftly as an eagle falls on its prey. Think of the precision of the swift's eye and mouth! While he is whirling over the water, he snaps up flying insects with such ease that the space he traverses is completely cleared of all the gnats and flies who a few moments before danced in the sunlight.

"Thus we went over streams, ponds and lagoons. By the way, Mr. Swift eats his food in a hurry and takes his drink the same way. He flies over the water, skimming up drops as he goes, and swallowing them at a very high rate of speed. No wonder that he hates to fly in a place crowded with boughs, larches and saplings.

"But so much flight in open air has its drawbacks. While a swift is eating insects with such speed, a sparrow-hawk may fall on him from above. Under these circumstances the swift cannot dip down, for that would mean death by drowning. I must tell you of one such attack on my friends. They were busy catching their dinner on a vast lake one afternoon, and while I was flying about, keeping an eye on the younger swifts, down came a sparrow-hawk. I who had undertaken to look after the children had to act quickly even at the risk of my own life. Without an instant's hesitation I plunged and tumbled, inserting my body between the enemy and the young ones. Well, the sparrow-hawk had never expected so much nerve from a member of the dove family, nor did he calculate my weight. I was at least five ounces heavier than he. He struck my tail with his talons, tore a few feathers, and thinking that he had got something he circled the air for a moment or two. Before he realized that he had only my feathers, all the swifts were safe, clinging to the bark of a tree out of anybody's reach. But the small sparrow-hawk was so infuriated that he fell on me with the fury of a large one. However, his body was very small and his talons smaller, and I knew they could not pierce my feathers and my skin very far. So I accepted his challenge and tumbled up. He followed. I shot downwards; he too dived after. Then I began to rise high. He pursued as before. But those little hawks fear the upper air, and his wings lagged now. To my two wing-beats he could make but one. Seeing him hopeless and tired, I planned to teach him the lesson of his life. No sooner had I conceived than I executed my plan. I shot downwards. He plunged after. Down, down, down! The water of the lake rose towards us, higher and higher every second till it looked no farther than the width of my wing. Then I flung forward a few inches and struck a warm air current that helped me upwards. As you know, air warmed in the hollow places and valleys of mountain country has a tendency to shoot up into cooler regions. We birds look for these currents to help us when we have need to make a sudden upward flight. Now I tumbled three times, and when I looked down I found that sparrow hawk drowning in the water. He had not been able to reach the air current. After a considerable ducking, he laboriously flew ashore, and there under thick leaves hid his disgrace. That instant the swifts came out of their hiding-place and flew southwards.

"The next day we met some wild ducks. They had coloured throats like mine, but otherwise they were as white as snow. They were stream ducks, whose habit is to float down a mountain brook after fish. When they have gone far, they rise out of the water and fly back to their starting-place. So they spend the day like shuttles going back and forth. Their bills were flatter than those of the geese, and they are dented inside, for once they close on a fish the bills never slip. They did not seem to care much for the shellfish, but that was probably because the fish in the lake were so plentiful. The swifts did not like the place because the ducks' wings beat the air continually and blew away the insects that normally fly over any water surface. Still, they were glad to see ducks that loved and lived on mountain torrents, never bothering about the calm water so dear to most ducks.

"It was these ducks who warned us against the owls and other murderers of the night that infested those regions. So we did our best to hide in places too small for owls to go into. It was easy to find holes in a tree small enough for the swifts, but I decided to stay in the open and take my chances. Night came on apace. Pretty soon my eyes could serve me no longer. Darkness within darkness, like layers of black cloth, lay upon them. I commended myself to the Gods of my race and tried to sleep. But who could sleep with those owls who-whoing about? Terror seized me for the night. Not an hour passed without some bird's shrieking in pain. The owls, too, hooted in triumph. Now a starling, then a bulbul (the Indian nightingale) would cry mortally, and die under the owl's grip. Though my eyes were shut, my ears knew the carnage that went on. A crow shrieked. Then another, then another. Almost a flock flew up in terror and smashed themselves against trees. But better that kind of death than to be killed by the searing and tearing beaks and claws of the owls. Soon to my utter confusion I smelt weasels in the air, and then I felt that death was at hand. That made me desperate; I opened my eyes to see. A pale white light was shining on all things. There before me, about six feet away, was a weasel. I flew up, though that increased the danger of my being killed by the owls. And sure enough, along came one, hooting and screaming. Two more owls followed. I heard their wing-beats, and by the nature of the sounds I knew that we were flying over the water, for it echoed back even the slightest shiver of our feathers. I could not fly in any direction very far, since I saw not more than six feet at a time, so I waited in the air, groping for a current that sucked the air of the river up above the boughs that hung over it. Alas, those owls were on me already, but I tumbled, then swung into a circle. The owls would not give up the chase. I rose farther up. Now the moonlight like water dripped from my wings. I could see a little more clearly, and that brought me back my courage. But my enemies did not relent. They too rose, and more light fell on their eyes, blinding them, though not completely. Suddenly two of them plunged towards me. Up I flew. The owls missed—lo! They had fallen on each other. Their claws locked together, their wings flapping helplessly in the air, they screamed like fiends and fell among the reeds of the river-bank.

"Now I looked about carefully and noticed to my surprise that I had flown towards the dawning of day and not at the moon. My terror-stricken eyes had not seen truly. But there were no more owls about; they had begun to seek for places of hiding from the growing sunlight. Although I felt safe, I kept away from the prodigious shadows of the tall trees, for even now an owl might lurk there. I stayed on a slender branch on a tree-top that caught the first flight of the sun's arrows, transfiguring it into an umbrella of dancing gold. Slowly the light spread farther down till the white torrent below trembled with colours like a weasel's eyes.

"Just then on the river-bank I saw an appalling sight. Two large crows, blacker than coal, were jabbing and prodding with their beaks a helpless blinking owl, caught in the reeds. Now that the sun shone, it could not open its eyes. Of course the night's slaughter done among the crows was large, and it was the crows' turn to avenge their wrongs, but I could not bear the sight of two of them killing that trapped owl. So I flew away from the murderers and went to seek my friends the swifts. I recounted some of my experiences, and the parents told me that they had heard terrible cries of distress that kept them from slumber. Mr. Swift asked if everything was safe outside, and I thought it was. When we came out, I found that poor owl lying dead, among the reeds!

"Strange to say, that morning we saw no ducks on the stream. Apparently they had flown very early in the morning in a southerly direction, and we decided to do the same. We planned not to seek the company of other birds going our way. For during the season of migration, wherever flocks of pigeons, grouse and other birds go, their enemies, such as owls, hawks and eagles, go after them. In order to avoid danger and such shocking sights as we had seen before, we flew to the east, and after going eastwards a whole day, we rested in the village of Sikkim. The next day we flew south for half a day, and again eastwards. That sort of roundabout journey took a long time, but it saved us no end of trouble. Once we were overtaken by a storm, and were blown into a lake country, and there I saw an amazing sight. I was on a tree-top, when below me I discerned a lot of domesticated ducks floating on the water, each one with a fish in its mouth. But none of them swallowed his morsel. I had never seen ducks resist the temptation to eat fish before, so I called the swifts to behold the sight. They clung to the barks of several trees and looked at the ducks, but they could hardly believe their eyes. What was the matter with them? Pretty soon a boat heaved in sight, poled by two men, flat-faced and yellow. On seeing them, the ducks paddled to the boat as fast as they could go. Reaching it, they hopped up, and then—can you believe it?—they dropped their capture into a large fish basket, and jumped down into the lake to fish for some more, and that went on for at least two hours. Apparently those Tibeto-Burman fishermen never cast nets. They tied a string tightly, almost to the choking point, around their ducks' necks, and then brought them to the lake to catch fish. Whatever the latter caught, they brought to their human masters. However, when their basket became full, they undid the strings that were around the ducks' necks, who then plunged into the lake, and gorged themselves on fish.

"Now we flew away far from the lakes for a while in quest of harvest-fields. There the swifts fell on the insects that flew about newly mown grain, and devoured them. I, too, ate to repletion of the grain, though not of the insects. While sitting on the fence of a rice-field, I heard someone hitting something. It sounded very much like a chaffinch cracking open a cherry-stone with his beak in order to get at its kernel. (Isn't it strange that a little bird's beak has the power of a nutcracker?) But, when I wandered nearer the place, under the fence, whence the noise was coming, I found another bird—a Himalayan thrush. He was engaged, not in cracking cherry stones, but in hitting a slowly moving snail with his beak. Tick, tack; tick, tack—tack! He hammered on and on until the snail was stunned into stillness. The thrush raised his head and looked around, poised himself on tiptoe, opened his wings, took a quick aim and struck three more blows—tack, tack, tack! The shell broke open, revealing a delicious snail. He lifted it up with his beak, which was bleeding slightly; apparently he had opened his mouth too wide and hurt its corners. After balancing the snail correctly in his grasp, he flew up and vanished into a tree where his mate was waiting for supper.

"The rest of our journey through the grain fields of Sikkim was uneventful. The only thing that is worth remembering was the trapping of peacocks by men in the forests. These birds come to the hot southern marshes in quest of food and warmth when the snakes and other creatures whom they eat go into winter quarters in the north.

"Peacocks and tigers admire one another. The former like to look at the tiger's skin, and he enjoys the beauty of their plumes. Sometimes at the water-hole a tiger will stand gazing at the plumes of a peacock on a bough, and the peacock will crane his neck to feast his eyes on the beauty of the striped skin. Now comes man, the eternal aggressor, on the scene. For instance, a man one day brought a piece of cloth painted exactly like a tiger's skin, so that no bird could tell by looking at it that it was not the striped one himself. Then he set a noose on a branch of a tree nearby, and slunk away. I could tell by the odour of the painted cloth that it was not a tiger, but peacocks have no sense of smell worth speaking of. They are victims of their own eyes. So in a few hours a pair of peacocks came and began to gaze at the make-believe tiger from a tree-top, coming lower and lower. They deceived themselves into the belief that the tiger was asleep. Emboldened by that illusion, they came very close and stood on the branch near the trap. It did not take them long to walk into it, but how they both stepped into a single trap I cannot make out. No sooner were they caught than they shrieked in despair. Then appeared the trapper, and played another trick on them. He threw up two large black canvas caps and lassoed them on each peacock's head, hiding the poor bird's eyes. Once the eyes are darkened, a bird never resists much. The man now tied their feet so that they could not walk; then he set one on each end of his bamboo pole. Slowly he lifted it by the middle, put it on his shoulder and walked off, the long tails of the peacocks streaming down like cataracts of rainbow before and behind him.

"There ends my Odyssey. The next day I said good-bye to the swifts. They went farther south, and I was glad to get home, a wiser and a sadder bird. Now," demanded Gay-Neck, "tell me this: Why is there so much killing and inflicting of pain by birds and beasts on one another? I don't think all of you men hurt each other. Do you? But birds and beasts do. All that makes me so sad."





PART TWO





Chapter One Gay-Neck's Training for War


After we returned to town, the air was filled with the rumours of a coming war somewhere in Europe. Now that winter was at hand, I decided to give Gay-Neck such training as would be necessary in case he was asked to be a carrier for the British War Department. Since he was used to the climate of the northeastern Himalayas, he would be an invaluable messenger for the army in any European country. Even now, with the aid of wireless telegraph and radio, no army can dispense with the help of carrier-pigeons. All that will become clear to you as the present story unfolds itself.

In training carriers for war work, I followed a plan of my own that Ghond approved. By the way, the old fellow came all the way to town with us. He stayed in our house two or three days, then decided to leave, saying: "The city is unbearable. I never loved any city, but this one frightens me with its electric tramway and how-aghari [wind chariot]—the automobile. If I do not shake the dust of this town off my feet very soon, I shall be nothing better than a coward. A tiger in the jungle does not frighten me, but I cannot say the same of an automobile. One crossing of a modern city street imperils more lives in a minute than a day in the most dangerous forests. Farewell! I go where the woods wear stillness for a dress, the air is free of odours and dust, and the sky, a hollowed turquoise, is not cross-cut and pierced with poles and telegraph wires. Instead of factory whistles I shall hear the song of birds; and in the place of thieves and gunmen I shall have innocent tigers and panthers face to face. Farewell!"

But before he left, he helped me to buy about forty more carriers, and some tumblers. You may ask me the reason of my preference for these two kinds. I do not know that I have any exclusive love for tumblers and carriers, but it is true that fan-tails, pouters and other pigeons are more ornamental than useful. In our house we had some of these varieties, but they proved so difficult to keep in company with the carriers and travellers that I finally bestowed all my appreciation on pure flyers.

In India we have a queer custom that I do not like. If you sell a carrier, no matter at what fabulous price, and it flies away from its new owner and comes back to you, it becomes your property again, and no matter what the value, you never refund the price. Knowing that to be the accepted custom among pigeon-fanciers, I had to train my newly acquired pets before anything else to love me. Since I had paid for them, I did not wish them to return to their former owners. I did my very best to make them cherish their new home loyally. But life is practical. I had to begin with the most necessary steps. The first few weeks I had to tie up their wings in order to keep them completely within the bounds of our roof. The art of tying a pigeon's feathers so that he is prevented from flying is delicate. You take a thread, and pass one end of it over one feather and under the next, very near its root, all the way until the entire wing is encompassed. Then you pass the other end of the thread by the same process under the first, over the second, and so on to the end of the wing, where the two ends of the thread are tied. It is very much like darning. It is an utterly painless form of captivity, for though it prevents a pigeon from flying, yet he is not kept from opening or flapping his wings. He can stretch them and can massage them with his beak. After this, I used to put my new pigeons at different corners of the roof so that they might sit still, and with their eyes take in the colour and quality of their new surroundings. At least fifteen days should be allowed for this process.

Here I must record a cunning thing that Gay-Neck did when his wings were tied in the above manner. I sold him early in November just to see if he would return to me when his wings were freed from their chain of threads.

Well, two days after purchasing Gay-Neck, his new owner came to me and said, "Gay-Neck has run away."

"How?" I asked.

"I don't know, but I cannot find him in my house."

"Did you tie his wings? Could he fly?" I asked.

"His wings were tied." he answered.

That struck terror to my soul. I said: "Oh, your brother of a camel and cousin of an ass, instead of running hither, you should have sought for him in your own neighbourhood. Do you not see that he tried to fly, but since his wings were tied, he fell off your roof? And by now he has been killed and devoured by some cat. Oh, this is a slaughter of a pigeon. You have robbed mankind of its diadem of carriers! You have murdered the glory of pigeonhood!" Thus I reproached him.

My words frightened the man so thoroughly that he begged me to come with him and hunt for Gay-Neck. My first thought was to rescue the poor fellow from cats. We spent a whole afternoon, but in vain. I examined more sordid alleyways in twelve hours, expecting to find him at bay before some mangy cat, than I have done in all the rest of my life. Alas, he was not to be found. That night I came home late, for which I got a good scolding, and went to bed a broken hearted boy.

My mother, who understood my state of mind, did not wish me to enter the world of sleep with hurt and excited feelings. She spoke: "Your pigeon is safe. Go to sleep in a calm mood."

"Why, Mother?"

She answered: "If you are calm, your tranquil thoughts can help you. If you are peaceful, your serenity will make him serene. And if he is serene, his mind will work well. And you know, my beloved, how keen Gay-Neck's mind is. If he sets to work with tranquillity he will overcome all obstacles and reach home and safety. Now let us make a prayer to Infinite Compassion, and calm ourselves." So we sat surrounded by the silence of night for half an hour, saying: "I am serene. All that exists is serene. Peace, peace, peace be unto all! Om Shanti, shanti, shanti!"

As I was going to sleep, my mother said: "You will now dream no bad dreams. Now that God's peace and compassion are kindled in you, you will have a night of fruitful rest. Peace!"

That it proved to be fruitful there is no doubt. For about eleven in the morning, Gay-Neck flew up across the sky. He rode high. How he freed his wings I shall have to tell you in his own language. Let us again use the grammar of fancy and the dictionary of imagination.

"O master of many tongues," began Gay-Neck on our own roof, "I could abide not more than a day in that man's house! He gave me insect-infected grain to eat, and made me drink water that was not fresh. After all, I am a soul; why should I be treated as a stone or shard? Moreover, he tied my wings with evil-smelling fishing tackle. Would I stay with such an one? Never! So hardly had he put me on the white roof of his house and gone downstairs, than I flapped my wings and flew. Alas! My wings were heavy, and it hurt me to fly. So I fell on the awning of a shop in the lane near by. There I sat waiting and watching for help. I saw some swifts go by; I called to them, but they were not my friends. I saw a wild pigeon; I called, but he too made no response. Just then I beheld a dark cat coming towards me. Here was death on four feet. As it drew nearer and nearer, its topaz eyes burned with red. It crouched and made ready to spring. I, too, sprang—clear over his head on to the cornice about five feet above the awning, where a swift had made his home. Though it was most difficult, I clung to that spot until the black one vanished. Now I leaped again. Four or five feet above me was the roof. There I perched. But my wing hurt. In order to ease my pain, I massaged the roots of my feathers. One by one my beak pressed and rubbed them, and then something slipped. One small feather I had succeeded in pressing out of the grip of the fishing tackle, which stank exceedingly. I kept on rubbing and pressing the next feather, and, behold, it too was free. Oh, what a glorious feeling! Soon the entire wing was free. Just then the black cat re-appeared on the roof, but now I was able to fly about ten feet and I reached the cornice of a high building, where I found a convenient perch. Thence I watched the deadly cat. He crouched, and sprang upon the fishing tackle just shed from my wing. That told me a new story: it was the stench of the fishing tackle that had attracted him, and not me. Forthwith I began to bite and press the cord that bound my other wing. By the time I had freed half the feathers, night came on; and when I had thrown my last evil-smelling chain away from my wing, I was forced to await the dawn to fly home, for owls fly in the early twilight, and hawks come later, and I wished to have a safe path through the air. Now I am at home—I am hungry and thirsty."

The first thing I did with my new pigeons was to give them food and fresh water. I never let them drink the water they bathed in. Since Gay-Neck's wing smelt of fish, I gave him separate quarters from the other pigeons. It took three days longer and three good baths before Gay-Neck was fit for decent society. In passing, let me remark that my father made me return the money to the man who had bought Gay-Neck with such deplorable results. To tell you the truth, I did not wish to then. But now I feel I did right in obeying my parent. After a fortnight, and before unbinding the wings of my newly acquired pigeons, I bribed them to love me. Every morning I would put some millet seed and peanuts in ghee (clarified butter). After they had been soaked in butter all day, I gave a dozen each to every one of my pets. They were so fond of those delicacies that in two days' time they had formed the habit of coming to me before five in the afternoon, begging for buttered seeds. In three more days I freed their wings, in a subtle way, undoing them about fifteen minutes before five. They all flew off the moment they felt their liberty. But lo, after the first exhilaration of finding their freedom had passed, they flew down to the roof again for their meal of buttered peanuts and millet seeds! It is a pity that we have to win our pigeons' confidence by feeding their stomachs, but alas! I have noticed that there are many men and women who resemble pigeons in this respect!





Chapter Two War Training (continued)


The new pigeons gradually learned to fly farther and farther away from the house as day followed day. At the end of a month they were taken a distance of fifty miles and more and uncaged, and with the exception of two who apparently fled home to their previous owner, all returned to me under Gay-Neck's leadership.

The question of an undisputed leadership was not an easy one to settle. In fact, a serious battle had to be fought out between Gay-Neck and two new males, Hira and Jahore. The last named was a pure-black tumbler. His feathers shone like panther's fur. He was gentle and not fierce, yet he refused to submit to Gay-Neck's leadership of the entire flock. You know how quarrelsome and full of display carriers generally are. On my roof all the carrier males used to strut, coo and talk as if each one of them was the monarch of all he surveyed. If Gay-Neck thought himself Napoleon, Hira (Diamond), the white carrier—as white "as the core of sunlight," to express it poetically—considered himself Alexander the Great, while Jahore (Black Diamond), though not a carrier, let it be known that he was Julius Caesar and Marshal Foch rolled into one. Besides those three, there were other conceited males, but they had already been beaten in battle by one or the other of the above three. Now it was necessary to fight out the question of absolute leadership of the entire flock.

One day Hira was seen preening his wings and talking nonsense in the presence of Mrs. Jahore, a beautiful jet-black creature with eyes as red as bloodstone. Matters had hardly gone any distance when from nowhere came Jahore, and fell upon Hira. The latter was so infuriated that he fought like a fiend. Beak against beak, feet against feet, and wings pitted against wings. All the other pigeons fled from the ring where the two males were engaged in trouncing each other. Gay-Neck stood over them, calm as an umpire over a tennis match. At last, after half a dozen set-tos, Hira won. Puffing himself to the uttermost limits of his conceit, he went over to Mrs.Jahore as much as to say: "Madame, your husband is a coward. Behold what a fine fellow I am. Buk, bukoom, kumkum." She gave him one crushing look of contempt, and flapping her wings withdrew to her husband in their home. Hira looked crestfallen and sulky in turn; then in a sudden paroxysm of anger he fell upon Gay-Neck tooth and nail. The latter, taken unaware, was very nearly knocked out at the first fury of the attack. Hira pecked and slapped him till he felt too dizzy to stand up, so Gay-Neck ran away pursued by the mad fellow. They ran in a circle, spinning like two tops. I could hardly see which was pursuer and which pursued. They went at such high speed that I could not see when they stopped and started to peck and slap each other. The explosive sound of wing hitting wing filled the air with an ominous clamour. Now feathers began to fly in every direction. Suddenly, beak to beak and claw in claw they wrestled and spun on the floor—two birds became a single incarnation of fury. Seeing that they could not reach any decision that way, Gay- Neck extricated himself from his rival's grip and flew up in the air. Hira followed, flapping his wings tremendously fast. About three feet above the ground Gay-Neck put his claws like talons around Hira's windpipe, and set to squeezing it more and more tightly, and at the same time kept up a terrific cannonade of wing-beats that, like flails of steel, threshed out a shower of snowy feathers from his opponent's body. Now, hid in that falling blizzard of feathers, the two rolled on the ground, pecking each other with the virulence of two maddened serpents. At last Hira let go and wilted like a torn white flower on the floor. One of his legs had been dislocated. As for Gay-Neck, his throat and neck had hardly any feathers left. But he was glad that the struggle had been settled one way or another. And he knew full well that had Hira not first expended half his strength fighting Jahore, he, Gay-Neck, might not have won the battle. However, all is well that ends well. I bandaged and did all that was necessary to Hira's leg. In another thirty minutes all the pigeons were eating their last meal of the day, utterly oblivious of what had happened so recently. No sulking and bearing of grudges in their blood—no doubt they all came from a fine set of ancestors! Good breeding prevailed even among the smallest of them, and needless to add, Hira took his defeat like a gentleman.

By now January had come, with cool weather and clear skies, and the competition for pigeon prizes began. Each man's flock was tested on three points: namely, team-work, long-distance flight and flight under danger. We won the first prize on the first point, but I am sorry to say that owing to a sad mishap, which you shall learn of in its proper place, my pigeons could not compete for the other two.

This is the nature of the team-work competition. The various flocks of pigeons fly way up from their respective homes. Once they are beyond the reach of whistling and other sounds that indicate their master's voice, the diverse flocks coalesce. Then spontaneously they agree to fly under the leadership of a pigeon whom they consider fit. All this happens up in the air where pigeon-wit and pigeon-instinct prevail, and the bird who flies forward and is allowed to lead does so without ever realizing the nature and the reason of the honour that has been bestowed on him.

The temperature dropped to forty-five. It was a fine cold morning for our part of India, in fact the coldest day of the year. The sky above, as usual in the winter, was cloudless and remote, a sapphire intangibility. The city houses—rose, blue, white and yellow—looked like an army of giants rising from the many coloured abyss of dawn. Far off, the horizons burned in a haze of dun and purple. Men and women in robes of amber and amethyst, after having said their morning prayers to God, were raising their arms from the house-tops in gestures of benediction to the rising sun. City noises and odours were unleashed from their kennels of the night. Kites and crows were filling the air with their cries. Over the din and clamour one could yet hear the song of the flute-players. At that moment the signal whistle blew that the contest had begun, and each pigeon-fancier waved from his roof a white flag. Instantly from nowhere innumerable flocks of pigeons rose into the sky. Flock upon flock, colour upon colour, their fluttering wings bore them above the city. Crows and kites—the latter of two species, red and brown—fled from the sky before the thundering onrush of tens of thousands of carriers and tumblers. Soon all the flocks—each flying in the shape of a fan—circled in the sky like so many clouds caught in large whirlpools of air. Though each moment they ascended higher, for a long time each owner of a flock knew his own from the others; and even when at last the separate flocks merged into a single unit and flew like a solid wall of wings, I could pick out, by the way they flew, Gay-Neck, Hira, Jahore and half a dozen others. Each bird had personal characteristics that marked him as he flew. When any owner wished to call the attention of any one of his pigeons, he blew a shrill whistle with certain stops as a signal. That attracted the bird's attention if he was within reach of the sound.

At last the whole flock reached such a height that not even the blast of a trumpet from any pigeon-fancier could reach it. Now they stopped circling in the air and began to move horizontally. The competition for leadership had begun. As they manoeuvred from one direction of the heavens to another, we, the owners below, had to look up intently in order to make sure of the characteristics of the one whom the pigeons had trusted to lead their flight. For a moment it looked as if my Jahore would lead. But hardly had he gone to the head of the flock when they all turned to the right. That brought about a confusion in the ranks, and, like horses on a race-course, all kinds of unknown pigeons pushed forward. But in time each one of them was pushed back by the rest of the flock. This happened so often that we began to lose interest in the contest. It looked as though some nondescript pigeon would win the coveted leadership prize.

Now suddenly rose the cry from many house-tops: "Gay-Neck, Gay-Neck, Gay-Neck!" Yes, many of that pigeon-fanciers were shouting that name. Now I could see—without the slightest shadow of error—my own bird at the head of the vast flock—a leader among leaders—directing their manoeuvres. Oh, what a glorious moment! He led them from horizon to horizon, each time rising a few feet higher, till by eight in the morning not a pigeon could be seen in any corner of the sky. Now we furled our flags and went downstairs to study our lessons. At midday, when again we went above, each man could see the entire wall of pigeons descending. Lo! Gay-Neck was still leading. Again rose the shout "Gay-Neck, Gay-Neck!" Yes, he had won the palm, for he had remained in leadership for more than four hours, and was coming down as he had gone up—a master!

Now came the most dangerous part of the flight. The Commander of the vast concourse gave the order to disband, and flock after flock split from the main body, each separate flock flying away to its home. But not too quickly. Some must guard the sky above them while the others flew homeward. Gay-Neck held my little flock in a kind of umbrella formation to protect the rear of the receding pigeons belonging to other contestants. Such is the price of leadership—the other name of self-sacrifice.

But now began a horrible climax. In India during the winter the buzzards called Baz come south. They do not eat carrion; like the eagle and the hawk the Baz generally eats what he kills with his own talons. They are mean and cunning—I think they are a class of low born eagles—but they resemble kites, although their wings are not frayed at the ends. They fly in pairs slightly above a flock of kites and are hidden by them from their prey, which, however, they can see in this way without ever being seen themselves.

On that particular day, just when Gay-Neck had won the leader's laurels, I perceived a pair of Baz flying with a flock of kites. Instantly I put my fingers in my mouth and blew a shrill whistle. Gay-Neck understood my signal. He redistributed his followers, he himself leading the centre, while Jahore and Hira he ordered to cover the two ends of the crescent, in which shape the flock was flying. The entire group held together as though it were one vast bird. They then began to dip down faster and faster. By now the task for which they tarried in the heavens was done. All the other flocks that they had played with in the morning had gone home.

Seeing them dip down so fast, a Baz fell in front of them like a stone dropping from a Himalayan cliff. Just when he had descended to the level of my birds, he opened his wings and faced them. This was no new tactic, for it has been used in the past by every Baz in order to strike terror into a flock of pigeons. That it succeeds in ten cases out of eleven is undeniable, for when it happens the terror struck pigeons lose their sense of solidarity and fly pell-mell in every direction. No doubt that was what the Baz hoped for now; but our wily Gay-Neck, beating his wings, flew without a tremor under the enemy about five feet, drawing the whole flock after him. He did it, knowing that the enemy never pounces upon a solidly unified group. But hardly had he gone a hundred yards forward when the second, probably Mrs. Baz, fell in front of the pigeons and opened her wings as her husband had done. But Gay-Neck paid no attention. He led the whole flock straight toward her. It was inconceivable. No pigeon had dared do that before, and she fled from their attack. Hardly had her back been turned when Gay-Neck and the rest of the pigeons dipped and swooped as fast as they could go. By now they were hardly six hundred feet from our roof, and then, as fate would have it, Mr. Baz, like a shell full of high explosives, fell again, this time right in the middle of the crescent, and opened his wings and beak like forks of fire, crying and shrieking with fury. That produced its effect. Instead of one solid wall of pigeons, the flock was cut in two, of which one half followed Gay-Neck, while the other, smitten with abject fear, flew none knew whither. Gay-Neck did what a true leader does in great crises. He followed that panic-stricken flock until his section overtook it, and in no time, lo, they had merged into a single group once more. Hardly had that taken place when Mrs. Baz in her turn descended like a thunderbolt between him and the other pigeons. She almost fell on his tail, and cut him off from the rest, who now, deprived of their mentor, sought safety in flight, paying no heed to anything. That isolated Gay-Neck completely, and exposed him to attacks from every side. Still undaunted, he tried to fly down to his retreating followers. Ere he had descended a dozen feet, down before him swooped Mr. Baz. Now that Gay-Neck saw the enemy so near, he grew more audacious, and tumbled. It was a fortunate action. Had he not done so, Mrs. Baz, who had shot out her talons from behind, would have captured him then and there.

In the meantime the rest of my pigeons were beating on, and had almost reached home. They were falling on the roof as ripe fruits fall from a tree. But one among them was not a coward. On the contrary, he was of the very essence of bravery. It was Jahore, the black diamond. As the whole crowd settled down on our roof, he tumbled and flew higher. There was no mistake about his intentions. He was going to stand by Gay-Neck. Seeing him tumble again, Mr. Baz changed his mind. He gave up pursuing Gay-Neck and swooped down after Jahore. Well, you know Gay-Neck—he dipped to the rescue of Jahore—circling and curving as swiftly as a coil of lightning, leading Mrs. Baz panting after him. She could not make as many curves as Gay-Neck, no, not nearly so many. But Mr. Baz, who was a veteran, had flown up and up to take aim; this put Jahore in danger. One more wrong turn, and Mr. Baz would have him. Alas! poor bird, he did the thing he should not have done. He flew in a straight line below Mr. Baz, who at once shut his wings and fell like a thunderclap of Silence. No noise could be heard, not even "the shadow of a sound." Down, down, down, he fell, the very image of death. Then the most terrible thing happened. Between him and Jahore slipped, none knew how, Gay-Neck, in order to save the latter and frustrate the enemy. Alas! Instead of giving up the attack, the Baz shot out his talons, catching a somewhat insecure hold of the intruder. A shower of feathers covered the air. One could almost see Gay-Neck's body writhing in the enemy's grip. As if a hot iron had gone through me, I shrieked with pain for my bird! But nothing availed. Round and round, higher and higher that Baz carried him, trying to get a more secure hold with his talons. I must admit something most humiliating here. I had been so intent on saving Gay-Neck that I did not notice when Mrs. Baz fell and captured Jahore. It must have happened very swiftly, right after Gay- Neck was caught. Now the air was filled with Jahore's feathers. The enemy held him fast in her talons, and he made no movement to free himself. But not so Gay-Neck; he was still writhing in the grip of Mr. Baz. As if to help her husband to grasp his prey more securely, Mrs. Baz flew very close to her lord. Just then Jahore struggled to get free. That swung her so near that her wing collided with her husband's. The fellow lost his balance. As he was almost over-turned in the air, with another shower of feathers Gay-Neck wrenched himself free from his grip. Now he dropped down, down, down.… In another thirty seconds a panting, bleeding bird lay on our roof. I lifted him up in order to examine his wound. His two sides were torn, but not grievously. At once I took him to the pigeon doctor, who dressed his wounds. It took about half an hour, and when I returned home and put Gay-Neck in his nest, I could not find Jahore anywhere. His nest, alas, was empty. And when I went up to the roof, there I found Jahore's wife sitting on the parapet, scanning every direction of the sky for a sign of her husband. Not only did she spend that day, but two or three more in the same manner. I wonder if she found any consolation in the fact that her husband sacrificed himself for the sake of a brave comrade.





Chapter Three Mating of Gay-Neck


Gay-Neck's wounds healed very slowly. Until about the middle of February he could not be made to fly more than ten yards above the roof. The duration of his flight, too, was very short. No matter how frequently I chased him off the roof, I could not keep him in the air more than a quarter of an hour. At first I thought that it was his lungs that were out of order. When, after investigation, they proved sound, I ascribed his disinclination to fly to his heart, which might have been injured by his latest mishap. That assumption also proved erroneous after a second investigation.

So, utterly exasperated by Gay-Neck's behaviour, I wrote a long letter to Ghond describing everything that had happened. It turned out that he had gone on a hunting-trip with some Englishmen. Receiving no help from that quarter, I decided to examine my pigeon most closely. Day after day I put him on our house-top, and watched, but no clue was vouchsafed me as to the nature of his trouble. So I gave up all hope of seeing Gay-Neck fly again.

About the end of February I received a cryptic note from Ghond from the deeps of the jungle. It read: "Your pigeon is frightened. Cure him of his fear. Make him fly." But he did not say how. Nor could I devise anything that would make Gay-Neck wing his way into the higher spaces. It was no use chasing him off the roof, for if I chased him off one corner, he flew across to another and perched there. And what was most disconcerting was that if the shadow of a cloud or a flock of birds flying in the sky fell on him on our roof, he would tremble with terror. Doubtless every shadow that fell filled his mind with the feeling that it was a Baz or a falcon swooping down on him. That gave me an idea of how badly shaken Gay-Neck was. How to cure him of his disease of fear proved most baffling. Had we been in the Himalayas, I would have taken him to the holy man who once healed him of a similar ailment, but here in the city there was no lama. I was forced to wait.

March had ushered in spring, and Gay-Neck, who had gone through an unusual moulting, looked like the very heart of a deep and large aquamarine. He was beautiful beyond description. One day, I know not how, I found him talking to Jahore's widow. She looked very bright with the advent of spring. In the sunlight her black-opal complexion glowed like a tropical night shot with stars. Of course I knew that marriage between her and Gay-Neck, though not the best thing for their offspring, might win him from his fear and her from the morose temper that had grown upon her ever since Jahore died.

In order to encourage their friendship, I took the two together in a cage to my friend Radja, who lived on the edge of the jungle about two hundred miles away. The name of his village was Ghatsila. It stood on the bank of a river across which lay high hills densely forested and full of all kinds of animals. Radja, being the priest of the village, which office his ancestors had held for ten centuries, and his parents were housed in a large building of concrete. The village temple, also of concrete, was adjacent to the house. In the courtyard of the temple, surrounded by high walls, Radja every night performed the duty of reading the Scriptures and explaining them to the peasantry that assembled there. While he would read aloud inside, outside would come from far off the yell of a tiger or the trumpeting of wild elephants across the narrow river. It was a beautiful and sinister place. Nothing dangerous happened in the village of Ghatsila, but you did not have to go very far to encounter any beast of prey that you cared to seek.

The train that brought me there reached Ghatsila at night. Radja and two servants of his house greeted me at the station. One of the servants took my bundle on his shoulder, and the other carried the cage with the two pigeons. Each of us had to carry a hurricane-proof lantern, an extra one having been brought for me. In single file, one servant leading and another in the rear, we walked for an hour. My suspicions were aroused, and I asked, "Why do we go round about?"

Radja said: "In the spring wild animals pass through here going north. We can't take short cuts through the woods."

"Nonsense!" I exclaimed. "I have done it many times before. When do we reach home?"

"In half an hour—"

Then, as if the very ground had opened at our feet and belched out a volcano with a terrific noise, arose the cry "Hoa—ho—ho— ho—hoa!"

The pigeons fluttered their wings in panic in their cage. I gripped Radja's shoulder with my disengaged hand, but instead of sharing my feelings he laughed out loud. And—like master like servant—the two servants laughed too.

After their mirth had subsided, Radja explained: "You have done this many times, have you? Then why did the cry of monkeys frightened by lanterns scare you?"

"Monkeys?" I questioned.

"Yes, lots of them," my friend reminded me, "go north this time of the year. We frightened a whole flock in the trees overhead. That's all. In the future don't take every monkey yell for the roar of a tiger."

Fortunately, we reached home shortly, without any other incident to upset my complacency.

The next morning Radja went to his duties at his ancestral temple, while I sought the roof and uncaged my birds. At first they were bewildered, but seeing me near them with my hands full of buttered seeds, they settled down to breakfast without any ado. Pretty nearly all of that day we spent on the roof. I dared not leave them by themselves very long lest the strangeness of their surroundings upset them.

In the course of the week that followed, the two birds made themselves at home in Ghatsila, and moreover became extremely intimate with each other. There was no doubt now that I had acted wisely in isolating them from the rest of the flock. About the eighth day of our stay, Radja and I were surprised to see Gay-Neck fly in pursuit of his mate. She flew on, but at a low altitude. He followed. Seeing him catch up to her, she rose and turned back. He too did the same, and followed after. Again she rose. But this time he balked, and began to circle the air beneath her. However, I felt that he was regaining his confidence. At last Gay- Neck, the paragon of pigeons, was healing himself of his fear and of his horror of the heavens; he was once more at home in the sky.

The next morning the birds flew higher and played with each other. Gay-Neck again refused to go all the way, and began to come down hastily instead of circling in the air below her. That puzzled me, but Radja, who was a keen person, explained. "A cloud, large as a fan, has come over the sun. Its shadow fell so suddenly that Gay- Neck thought it was his enemy. Wait until the cloud passes, and then—"

Radja was right. In a few more seconds the sun came out and its light dripped from Gay-Neck's wings once more. At once he stopped coming downwards and began to make circles in the air. His mate too, who had been coming down to keep him company, waited for him a hundred feet or so above. Now Gay-Neck rose, beating his wings like an eagle freed from his cage. The sunlight made pools of colour about him as he swerved and swung up and up. Soon, instead of following, he led his mate. Thus they ascended the sky—he healed of fear completely, and she ravished by his agility and power.

The next morning both of them made an early start. They flew far and very long. For a while they were lost beyond the mountains, as if they had slid over their peaks and down the other side. They were gone at least an hour.

At last they returned about eleven o'clock, each bearing in his beak a large straw. They were going to build a nest for the laying of eggs. I thought I would take them home, but Radja insisted that we should stay at least a week longer.

Every day during that week we spent some hours in the more dangerous jungle across the river, taking the two pigeons with us in order to release them in the dense forest hardly five miles from Radja's house. Gay-Neck forgot everything save testing his sense of direction and making higher flights. In other words, love for his mate and the change of place and climate healed him of fear, that most fell disease.

Here let it be inscribed in no equivocal language that almost all our troubles come from fear, worry and hate. If any man catches one of the three, the other two are added unto it. No beast of prey can kill his victim without frightening him first. In fact, no animal perishes until its destroyer strikes terror into its heart. To put it succinctly, an animal's fear kills it before its enemy gives it the final blow.





Chapter Four War Calls Gay-Neck


By the First Week of August, just after the children were born, Hira and Gay-Neck had gone from Calcutta to Bombay, setting sail with Ghond to serve in the World War. I sent that bachelor bird Hira with Gay-Neck because the army had need of both.

I was very glad that Gay-Neck had some knowledge of his little ones before he sailed for the battlefield of Flanders and France. The chief reason for this happiness was that I knew that a pigeon whose wife and new-born children are waiting at home rarely fails to return. That bond of love between Gay-Neck and his family assured me that he would do his work of carrying messages very well. No sound of gun-fire, nor bullets, as long as he lived, could keep him from returning home at the end.

But here one may raise the question that home was in Calcutta and the war was thousands of miles away. That is true. But all the same, because he had left his wife and children at home, he would do his utmost to fly back to his temporary nest with Ghond.

It is said that Gay-Neck carried several important messages between the front and General Headquarters where the Commander -in-Chief and Ghond waited for him. Of course, Gay-Neck was attached to Ghond first. But in the course of the following months he became very fond of the Chief.

Ghond and not I went to the front with the two pigeons, for I was under age and ineligible for any kind of service, so the old fellow had to take them. During the voyage out from India to Marseilles, Hira and Gay-Neck and the old hunter became fast friends. I have yet to see any strange animal resist Ghond's friendship long, and since my pigeons had known him before, it was easy for them to respond to him.

During the stay of the Indian Army in Flanders from September 1914 till the following spring, Ghond remained near General Headquarters with his cage, while Hira or Gay-Neck was taken by different units to the front. There from time to time messages were written on thin paper weighing no more than an ounce, and were tied to his feet; then he was released. Gay-Neck invariably flew to Ghond at the General Headquarters of the army. There the message was deciphered and answered by the Commander-in-Chief himself. It is rumoured that the latter personage loved Gay-Neck, and valued his services highly.

But it is better to listen to Gay-Neck's own story. As the experiences of a dream cannot be told except by the dreamer, so some of the adventures of Gay-Neck he should recount in person.

"After we crossed the black water—the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean—we travelled by rail through a very strange country. Though it was September, yet that country—France—was as cold as southern India in the winter. I expected to see snow capped mountains and giant trees, for I thought I was nearing the Himalayas. But no hills higher than our tallest bamboo trees could I perceive on the horizon. I do not see why a land has to be cold when it is not high.

"At last we reached the battle-front. It turned out to be the rear end of it, but even there you could hear the boom, boom, boom of the fire-spitters. And, as a normal pigeon, I have all fire-spitters no matter of what size and shape. Those metal dogs barking and belching out death were not to my liking. After I had been there a couple of days, our trial flight began. There were only four pigeons of our own city besides Hira and myself. You know how rash Hira could be. No sooner had we flown up above the houses of a large village than Hira flew towards the direction of the boom, boom, boom. He wanted to investigate. Well, in an hour's time we were there. Oh, what a noise! Big balls of fire, spat out like thunderbolts by the metal dogs hidden under trees, hissed and exploded below us. I was frightened, so I rose higher and higher. But no peace there in the highest heavens could I find. From nowhere came vast eagles roaring and growling like trumpeting elephants. At such a terrific sight, we flew towards where Ghond was waiting for us. But the eagles, two of them, followed! We went faster and faster. Fortunately, they could not overtake us. Just as we had expected, those eagles came down where we lived. I felt death was at hand. Those eagles were going to devour us in our cages like weasels. But no! They stopped trumpeting soon and lay down on the field—dead. Two men each jumped out of the stomachs of those two birds and walked away. I wondered how eagles could devour human beings. And how could the fellows come out alive?

"Soon enough the men returned from their errand, climbed inside the eagles, and then with a groan and trumpeting racket, they came alive and flew up in the air again. That left no doubt in my mind that they were men's chariots, and when I knew that I felt relieved.

"Though everything looked strange at first, it ceased to be so after we got used to it; yet the problem of sleeping soundly under the continual booming and barking noises remained unsolved. All those months in the army I never slept well. No wonder Hira and I were nervous and fidgety, like newly hatched snakes.

"My first adventure consisted of taking a message from the Rasseldar at the front where all kinds of dogs barked and spat fire day and night. I must tell you a word about the Rasseldar. He was in charge of a lot of Indian warriors from Calcutta. He took me in a cage completely covered with black canvas, and with his forty men set out for the front trench. After going for hours and nights—for that is what it felt like in my darkened cage—we reached our destination. There the canvas was removed. Now I could see nothing but walls around me where turbaned men from India crawled like little insects. Overhead flew the mechanical eagles trumpeting with terror. Here for the first time I began to grasp sounds. Instead of one confused boom, boom, boom, there were as many grades of explosion as the ear could distinguish. The hardest one to make out was the talk of the men about me. Under the deafening sounds their talk sounded like the whisper of a lazy breeze in the grass. Now and then they unmuzzled a metal dog that barked—spitting out fire for a long stretch of time. Then came the laughter of a hyena. Hundreds of men goaded those little pups to an awful coughing—puck puff, puck puff, puck puff! That sound was drowned in the deep-toned cry of the eagles above who flew in flocks and barked as well as screeched like mad, slaying each other like so many sparrows. The Rasseldar who was in charge of me pointed the face of his pup at the sky, then let off—puck puff—some fire, and lo! It brought down one of those eagles as if it were a rabbit. Now the deepest tone was heard. The boom bazoom buzz bum! The tiger-roar of the large ones' mammoth majesty rose and spread like a canopy of divine chords, drowning under its engulfing immensity all other petty sounds. Oh, the excruciating enchantment of that organ tone! Can I ever forget? Roar upon roar, titanic tonality on tonality, like cataclysmic boulders of sounds crashed and clamoured!

"Why does beauty lie so close to death? Hardly had the ineffable glory of that supernal music overhead seized my soul when balls of fire fell about us like a torrential rain. Men fell and succumbed like rats in flooded holes. The Rasseldar, who was bleeding and red, wrote hastily on a piece of paper, tied it to my feet, and uncaged me. I knew by the look in his eyes that he was in dire distress and wanted Ghond to bring him succour.

"Of course you know, my master, I flew up; but what I beheld almost froze my wings. The air above the trenches was one sheet of flying fire. How to rise above it was my problem. I used my tail rudder, and steered my flight in every direction. But no matter which way I rose, above me ran a million shuttles of flame, weaving the garment of red destruction on the loom of life. But I had to rise, I, Gay-Neck, the son of my father. And soon I struck a pocket of air that was full of a current that sucked and whirled me up as if my wing were broken and I were as light as a leaf. It turned me up and down and up again till I had torn my way through the fabric of fire that kept on weaving itself with ever-increasing rapidity. But I had no eye for anything now. 'To Ghond, to Ghond,' I kept saying to myself. Every time I said that, it dug like a fresh goad into my spirit and made me put forth my greatest effort. Now that I had risen very high, I made my observations and flew westwards. Just then a shot pierced and broke my rudder. Half of my tail was burned and torn away from me. And you know that made me furious! My tail is my point of honour. I can't bear it to be touched, let alone shot at. Well, I flew safely home, but just about the moment I was getting ready to do down, two eagles started a fight above me. I had not heard their trumpeting or seen their faces. Had they killed each other I would not have minded, but they let loose a hurricane of flames after me. The more they fought, the more fire fell from their beaks. I dived and ducked as well as I could. If only they had had some trees there. Of course, there had been trees, but most of them had been shot and mutilated so that they stuck out like stumps, with no shade-giving gracious foliage or any prodigious boughs. So I had to zigzag my way round and about those dilapidated spikes like a man fleeing from elephants in the jungle. At last I reached home and perched on Ghond's wrist. He cut the thread and took the message with me to the Commander-in-Chief, who looked like a ripe cherry and exuded a pleasant odour of soap. Probably, unlike most soldiers, he bathed and soaped himself clean three or four times a day. After he had read what was scribbled on that paper by the Rasseldar, he patted me on the head and grunted like a happy ox."





Chapter Five Second Adventure


"The next time we were taken to the front was after the Rasseldar recovered from his slight wounds. On this occasion he took both Hira and me. I knew at once that the message we were to carry was so important that two had to be trusted with it so that at least one might succeed.

"It was very cold. I felt as if I were living in a kingdom of ice. It rained all the time. The ground was so foul that every time you stepped on it your feet got caught in mud like quicksand, and your feet felt so cold, as if you had stepped on a corpse.

"Now we reached a strange place. It was not a trench, but a small village. Around it beat and burst the tides of burning destruction. It was, by the look on the men's faces, a very sacred and important place, for they did not want to give it up, though the red tongues of death licked almost every roof, wall and tree of this place. I was very glad to be in an open space. One could see the grey sky low, oh, so very low. And one could see the frost-whited patches of ground where no shell had yet fallen. Even there, in that very heart of pounding and shooting, where houses fell as birds' nests in tempests, rats ran from hole to hole, mice stole cheese, and spiders spun webs to catch flies. They went on with the business of their lives as if the slaughtering of men by their brothers were as negligible as the clouds that covered the sky.

"After a while the booming stopped. And it looked as if the village—that is, what was left of it—were safe from attack. It grew darker and darker. The sky lowered so far that I could put my beak into it. The dank cold seized every feather of my body and began to pull it out, as it were. I found it utterly impossible to sit still in our cage. Hira and I hugged each other tight in order to keep warm.

"Again firing broke out. This time from every direction. Our little village was an island surrounded by the enemy. Apparently under cover of the fog that had enwrapped everything, the enemy had cut off our connection from the rear. Then they started shooting the sky-rockets. It was dark and clammy like a Himalayan night, though it was hardly past noon. I wondered how men knew it was anything but night. Men, after all, know less than birds.

"Hira and I were released to carry our respective messages. We flew up, but not very far, for in a short time we were devoured by a thick fog. Our eyes could see nothing. A cold clammy film pressed itself on them, but I had anticipated something like this. I did what I would do under such circumstances, whether on a field of battle or in India. I flew upwards. It seemed as if I could go no farther than a foot at a time. My wings were wet. My breathing was caught in a long process of sneezing. I thought I should drop dead in an instant. Thank the Gods of the pigeons I could see for a few yards now! So I flew higher. Now my eyes began to smart. Suddenly I realized I must draw down my film—my second eyelids that I use in flying through a dust-storm—if I were to save myself from blindness, for we were not in a fog—it was an evil-smelling, eye-destroying smoke let out by men. My eyes pained as if somebody had stuck pins into them. My films now covered my eyes, and, holding my breath, I struggled upwards. Hira, who was accompanying me, rose too. He was choking to death with that gas. But he was not going to give up his flight. At last we rose clear of the sheet of poison smoke. The air was pure here, and as I removed the film from my eyes I saw, far away against the grey sky, our line. We flew towards it.

"Hardly had we flown half-way homeward when a terrible eagle with black crosses all over it flew nearer and spat fire at us—puck puff, puck puff, pop pa.…We ducked and did the best we could. We flew back to its rear. There the machine could not hit us. Imagine us flying over the tail of that machine-eagle. It could do nothing. It began to circle. So did we. It turned somersaults. So did we. It could do nothing without wriggling its tail; unlike that of a real eagle, its tail was as stiff as a dead fish. We knew that if we once came in front of it again, we would be killed instantaneously.

"Time was passing. I realized that we could not go on staying over the tail of that machine-eagle forever. The village covered with poison gas that we had left behind held the Rasseldar and our friends. We must get our message through for their safety and succour.

"Just then the machine-eagle played a trick. It flew back towards its home. We did not wish to go into the enemy's line flying over its tail in order to be sniped by sharpshooters. Now that we were half-way to our own home and in sight of our line, we gave up being careful; we turned away from the machine-eagle and flew at our highest speed, rising higher every few wing-beats. No sooner had we done that than the miserable beast turned and followed. Fortunately, it took him a little time. There was no doubt now that we were flying over our own lines. Just the same that plane rose to our level and kept on pouring fire on us—puff puff pop pa! Now we were forced to duck and dive. I made Hira fly under me. That protected him. So we flew, but fate is fate. From nowhere came an eagle and fired at the enemy. We felt so safe now that Hira and I flew abreast of each other. Just then a bullet buzzed by me and broke his wings. Poor wounded Hira! He circled and fell through the air like a silver leaf, fortunately in our line. Seeing that he was dead, I flew at lightning speed; never turning back to see the duel of the two eagles.

"When I got home I was taken to the Commander-in-Chief. He patted my back. Then, for the first time, I realized what an important message I had brought, for as soon as the old man had read the piece of paper he touched some queer ticking things, and he lifted a piece of horn and growled into it. Now Ghond took me to my nest. There, as I perched, thinking of Hira, I felt the very earth shake under me. Machine-eagles flew in the air as thick as locusts. They howled, whirred and barked. Below, from the ground, boomed and groaned innumerable metal dogs. Then came the deep-toned howl of the big spitfires like a whole forest of tigers gone mad. Ghond patted my head and said, 'You have saved the day.' But there was no day in sight. It was a darkening grey sky under which death coiled and screamed like a dragon, and crushed all in its grip. How bad it was you may gauge from this: when I flew near our base for exercise next morning I found that hardly a mile from my nest the ground was ploughed up by shells. And even rats and field-mice did not manage to escape: dozens of them had been slaughtered and cut to pieces. Oh! It was terrible. I felt so melancholy. Now that Hira was dead I was alone, and so weary!"





Chapter Six Ghond Goes Reconnoitring


About the first week of December, Ghond and Gay-Neck were to go on a reconnaissance trip all by themselves. The place they went to was a forest not far from Ypres, Armentieres and Hazebrouck. If you take a map of France and draw a line from Calais south almost in a straight line, you will come across a series of places where the British and Indian armies were situated. Near Armentieres there are many graves of Indian Mohammedan soldiers. There are no graves of Indian Hindu soldiers because the Hindus from time immemorial have cremated their dead, and those that are cremated occupy no grave. Their ashes are scattered to the winds, and no place is marked or burdened with their memory.

To return to Ghond and Gay-Neck. They were sent to a forest near Hazebrouck, which was behind the enemy's line, to find out the exact location of an enormous underground ammunition dump. If found, Ghond and the pigeon, singly or together, were to return to the British Army Headquarters with an exact map of the place. That was all. So one clear December morning, Gay-Neck was taken on an aeroplane. It flew about twenty miles over a forest, part of which was held by the Indian Army and the rest by the Germans. When they had gone beyond the German line, Gay-Neck was released. He flew all over the woods; then having gained some knowledge of the nature of the land, he flew back home. This was done to make sure that Gay-Neck knew his route and had some inkling of what was expected of him.

That afternoon when the sun had gone down, which happened at about four o'clock at this latitude ten degrees north of New York, Ghond, most warmly dressed, with Gay-Neck under his coat, started. They went on an ambulance as far as the second line of the Indian Army in the great forest. In utter darkness they proceeded to the front, conducted by some members of the Intelligence Service.

Soon they found themselves in what is called No Man's Land, but fortunately it was covered with trees, most of which had not yet been destroyed by shell-fire. Ghond, who did not know French or German and whose knowledge of English was confined to three words, "yes," "no" and "very well," was now left to find a German ammunition dump in a forest, accompanied only by a pigeon fast asleep under his coat.

First of all he had to remind himself that he was in a country of the cold Himalayan climate where, during the winter, trees stood bare and the ground was covered with dry autumn leaves and frost. Since there was very little foliage on tree or sapling, concealment of himself proved not an easy task. The night was dark, and as cold as a corpse, but since he could see in the dark better than any living man, and because his sense of smell was as keen as the keenest of all animals, he knew how to steer his course in No Man's Land. Fortunately, that night the wind was from the east.

Edging his way between tree-trunks, he pushed forward as fast as possible. His nose told him minutes before their arrival that a company of Germans was passing his way. Like a leopard he crawled up a tree, and waited. They never heard even the flicker of a sound. Had it been daylight they would have found him, for his bare feet bled as he walked on the frost-stricken ground, leaving distinct marks behind.

Once he had a very close shave. As he went up a tree and sat on a branch to let a couple of German sentries pass below him, he heard someone whisper from a branch into his ear. He knew at once that it was a German sharpshooter. But he bent his head, and listened. The German said, "Guten nacht," then stepped over and slid down the tree. No doubt he had taken Ghond for one of his fellow-soldiers who had come to relieve him. After a while Ghond descended to the ground and followed the footprint of that German. Dark though it was, his bare feet could feel where the ground had been worn down by the feet of man. No difficult task that, for him.

At last he reached a place where a lot of men were bivouacking. He had to skirt around them softly, still pressing forward. He heard a strange noise right at his feet. He stopped and listened. No mistake, this was a familiar sound! He waited. The steps of an animal: Patter pat, patter-r-r! Ghond moved towards the sound, and a suppressed growl ensued. Instead of fear, joy gripped his heart. He who had spent nights at a time in the tiger-infested jungles of India was not to be deterred by the growl of a wild dog. Soon enough two red eyes greeted his vision. Ghond sniffed the air before him carefully as he stood there, and lo! He could not detect there was the slightest odour of man about that dog; the creature had gone wild. The dog, too, was sniffing the air to find out what kind of being he was facing, for Ghond did not exude the usual human odour of fear, and so the animal came forward and rubbed against him and sniffed vigorously. Fortunately, Ghond carried Gay-Neck above the dog's nose, and the odour of the bird's presence was carried up by the wind, so the wild dog perceived in the man before him nothing but a friendly fearless fellow. He wagged his tail, and whined. Ghond, instead of patting his head with his hand, slowly put it before the dog's eyes to see and smell. A moment of suspense followed. Was the dog going to bite the hand? Another moment passed. Then… the dog licked it. He now whined with pleasure. Ghond said to himself: "So this hunter's dog is without a master. Probably his master is dead. The poor beast has become as wild as a wolf. He lives by preying on the food supply of the German Army, for it is evident he had not yet eaten any human flesh. So much the better."

Ghond whistled softly, the call of all hunters of all ages no matter in what country. It meant "Lead." And the dog led. He skirted all the bivouacs of the German soldiers as deftly as a stag slips by a tiger's den. After hours of wandering, they reached their destination. There was no mistake about it; Ghond had found the very depot not only of munitions but also of German food supplies. His leader, the wild dog, went through a secret hole in the ground, then after half an hour emerged with a large leg of veal between his jaws. That it was bovine meat Ghond could tell by its odour. The dog sat down to his dinner on the frosty ground, while the man put on his boots, which he had carried slung over his shoulder all night long, and then looked up and took observations. By the position of the stars he could tell where he was. He waited there some time.

Slowly the day began to break. He took a compass from his pocket. Yes, he felt quite sure that he could draw a map of the place. Just then the dog jumped up and grabbed Ghond's coat with his teeth. There was no doubt in the man's mind that the dog wanted to lead him on again. He ran ahead, and Ghond followed as fast. Soon they reached a spot so thickly covered with thorns and frozen vines that passage through it was possible only for an animal. The dog crawled under a lot of sharp thorns, and disappeared.

Now Ghond drew a diagram showing the position of the stars, and the exact position of this compass, and tied both to Gay-Neck's foot, and let him go. He watched the pigeon fly from tree to tree, resting on each for a minute or so, and preening his wings. Then he struck the message tied to his foot with his beak—probably he was making sure that it was securely tied—flew up to the top of the tallest tree, and sat there examining the lay of the land. That moment Ghond, who was looking up, felt something pull him. He looked down at his feet; the dog was dragging him to a hole under the thorns. Ghond bent low, low enough to follow his mentor's direction, but at that moment he heard the flutter of wings overhead, then the barking of rifles. He had no desire to get up and investigate whether Gay-Neck had been killed or not. He crawled down under the thorns till he felt as if his stomach were glued against his backbone, and both sewed tightly to the ground. He pushed and crawled till suddenly he slid down, falling about eight feet into a dark hole. It was pitch dark, but Ghond hardly noticed that at first, for he was occupied in rubbing his bruised head.

When finally he tried to discover where he was, he made out that he must be sitting on a frozen water-hole covered, like a thieves' den, by impenetrable thorn-bushes. Even in winter when no leaf clad the branches and vines overhead, the darkness in daytime was thick there. The dog was still with him, and had evidently dragged him there to safety. The poor beast was so happy to have a friend with him that he wanted to play by the hour with Ghond, but the latter, being sleepy, dozed off into perfect slumber in spite of the noise of the guns not very far away.

After about three hours the dog suddenly whined and then yelled as if he were stricken with madness, after which the earth rocked under terrific sounds of explosion. Unable to bear it, the animal kept tugging the sleeve of Ghond's coat. The detonations rose crescendo upon crescendo till the place where Ghond lay literally swayed like a cradle, but he would not leave his hiding. All he said to himself was: "O Gay-Neck, thou incomparable bird, how well thou hast done thy task! Already thou hast borne the message to the cherry-faced chief, and this is his thunderous reply. O thou pearl among winged creatures!" So on he mumbled while the bombs dropped by aeroplanes ignited the German munitions dump.

Then the dog, who had been trying to pull him away by the sleeve of his coat, whined and shivered like one in high fever, and that instant something sizzled through the air and fell near by with a thud. With a desperate yell the poor dog dashed out of his hiding place. Ghond followed. But too late. For hardly had he crept half way under the thorns when an ear-splitting explosion seemed to cut the ground from under him, and a violent pain pierced his shoulder. He felt borne up by some demoniac power and flung to the ground with great force. Scarlet diamonds of light danced before his eyes for a few moments, followed by quenching darkness.

An hour later when he regained consciousness the first thing that he became aware of was a sound of Hindustani voices. In order to hear his native language more distinctly, he tried to raise his head. That instant he felt a shooting pain like the sting of a thousand cobras. There was no doubt in his mind now that he had been hit and probably mortally wounded. All the same his soul rejoiced every time he heard Hindustani spoken near him, for that meant that Indian troops, and not the enemy, were in possession of the forest now. "Ah," he said to himself, "my task is accomplished. I can die in peace."





Chapter Seven Gay-Neck Tells How He Carried the Message


"All that night preceding the eventful day I slept very little. Though I lay under his coat, Ghond had no knowledge that I was awake. You cannot sleep next to the heart of a man who runs like a stag, climbs trees like a squirrel or picks up strange dogs for company every half-hour.… Ghond's heart thumped so hard now and then that you might have heard it yards away. He did another thing that was not conducive to sleep at such close quarters; he breathed irregularly all that night. Sometimes he inhaled long breaths. Sometimes he breathed as fast as a mouse fleeing from a cat. I might as well have tried to sleep on a storm in the sky as under the coat of such a man.

"Then that dog! Shall I ever forget him? I was frightened when Ghond first annexed him, but he got no scent from my body, and the air that rose from below told me that somehow, like a clean-smelling ghost, he had come to befriend us. His footsteps I shall remember all my life. He walked as softly as a cat. He must have been a savage dog, for dogs that live in civilization are noisy. They cannot even walk quietly. Man's company is corrupting: every animal, excepting cats, becomes careless and noisy in human society. But that dog was quite wild. He walked without noise. He breathed without any sound. Then how did I know that he was there? It was that odour that came up from the ground and greeted my nostrils.

"After a sleepless and most uncomfortable night Ghond let me go, and I could hardly recognize the place where he had released me. So I flew from tree to tree to find my bearings, which only drove fright into my very soul. For now that day had broken, the trees were filling up with eyes. Strange blue eyes were looking through tubes in different directions. There were men behind them, and one was looking from a tree-top about a foot from where I perched. He had not heard my coming, on account of all those metal dogs barking around us—puff papapa pack!

"But as I flew up, he saw me. I felt that if I did not make haste and hide under other trees he would shoot me; and he did fire many times, but I was behind a copse as thick as the matted hair of a hermit. I decided to hop from tree to tree, not flying until the prospect was free of danger. I spent no little time in going about half a mile that way. At last my feet felt very fatigued, and I decided to fly, danger or no danger.

"Fortunately, no one had seen me fly up. I rose high after making large circles in the air. From a place whence the forest of trees appeared as small as saplings, I looked in different directions. Far off in the east, like chariots of gold, flew a flock of aeroplanes against the dawning sky. That meant the enemy's coming upon me if I waited much longer. So I started westwards. That seemed to be the signal for a thousand sharpshooters on tree-tops to fire at me.

"I think that when I circled up and above their trees, the Germans were uncertain whether I was their carrier or not, but the moment the sharpshooters perceived that I was going west they were sure that I was not their messenger, and so they shot at me to bring me down and find out what I carried on my foot.

"I could not go up for ever in the clear winter air without being frozen and anyway, I did not want those enemy planes to gain on me. Again I dashed westwards, and again the wall of bullets spread before me like barbs of death. But I had no choice left; either pierce my way through, or be killed by the oncoming aeroplanes, who were so near that I could see their passengers. So I dashed towards the west. Fortunately, by now my tail, which was hurt about a month ago, had grown almost to its normal size. Without that rudder my task would have been twice as hard. As I kept on going towards our line, the fusillade increased. There was no doubt now that all the sharpshooters and men in the trenches far off were taking a shot at me. But I zigzagged, circled, tumbled and in fact did all the stunts and tricks I knew to cheat the ever-augmenting swarm of bullets, but all that zigzagging business lost me time. One of the aeroplanes had come within striking distance of even so small a mark as I made, and began to pour loads of fire from above and behind. There was nothing to do but go forward, so I dashed on. Oh! How hard I flew— fast as the fastest storm. Then—ftatattafut—I was hit! My leg was broken right near the groin, and it, with its message, dangled under me like a sparrow in a single talon of a hawk. Oh! The pain, but I had no time to think of that, for that aeroplane was still after me, and I flew harder than before.

"At last our own line came into view. I fled lower. The machine dived down too. I tried to tumble, but failed. My leg prevented me from trying any of my tricks. Then pa-pa-pat-pattut—my tail was hit, and a shower of feathers fell below, obscuring for a moment the view of the men in the German trenches. So I shot down in a slanting flight towards our line and—passed it, making a circle. Then I beheld a strange sight—the aeroplane had been hit by our men. It swayed, lurched, and fell. But it had done its worst ere it went down in flames—it had hit my right wing and broken it. It gave me satisfaction to see it catch fire in the air and fall, yet my own pain had increased so that I felt as if twenty buzzards were tearing me to pieces, but, thanks to the Gods of my race, I lost consciousness of either pain or pleasure, and felt as if a mountainous weight were pulling me down.…

"They kept me at the pigeon hospital for a month. Though my wing was repaired and my leg sewn up where it belonged, they could not make me fly again. Every time I hopped up in the air my ears, I know not how, were filled with terrible noises of guns, and my eyes saw nothing but flaming bullets. I was so frightened that I would dash immediately to the ground. You may say that I was hearing imaginary guns and seeing imaginary walls of bullets: maybe, but their effect on me was the same as that of real ones. My wings were paralysed, my entrails frozen with terror.

"Besides, I would not fly without Ghond. Why should I spring from the hands of a man whose complexion was not brown and whose eyes were blue? I had not known such people before. We pigeons don't take to any and every outsider. At last they brought me in a cage to the hospital where Ghond was, and left me beside him. When I saw him I hardly recognized him, for his eyes—Ghond's eyes—wore a look of real fear! Yes, he too had been frightened out of his wits for once. I know, as all birds and beasts do, what fear looks like, and I felt sorry for Ghond.

"But on seeing me, that film of terror left his eyes, and they burned with a light of joy. He sat up in bed, took me in his hands and kissed my foot that had held the message that he had sent. Then he patted my right wing, and said: 'Even in great distress, O thou constellation of divine feathers, thou hast borne thy owner with his message among friends and won glory for all pigeons and the whole Indian Army. Again he kissed my foot. His humility touched me and by example humbled me. I felt no more pride when I remembered how I fell in the trenches of an Indian brigade after that aeroplane had partly smashed my wing, for had I fallen in a German trench, then…they would have seized the message on my leg; they would have surrounded the forest where Ghond lay hid with that wild dog—I shuddered to think of what they would have done! Alas! The dog, our true friend and saviour, where was he now?"





Chapter Eight Healing of Hate and Fear


"That dog," Ghond took up the story, "must have lost his French master early in the war. Probably the Germans had shot the man, and after that, when he saw his master's home looted and the barn set on fire, he went wild with terror and ran away into the woods, where he lived hidden from the sight of men under the thick thorn-bush, as spacious as a hut and as dark as the interior of a tomb. Probably he ventured out only at night in quest of food, and being a hunting-dog by heredity, all his savage qualities returned as he spent day after day and night after night in the woods like an outlaw.

"When he came across me, he was surprised because I was not afraid. I gave out no odour of fear. I must have been the first man in months whose fear did not frighten him to attack.

"Of course, he thought that, like himself, I too was hungry and was looking for food. So he led me to the German food depot, and through an underground passage he crawled into a vast provision chamber—a very gold-mine of food—and fetched some meat for me. I drew the conclusion that there were a series of underground chambers in which the Germans kept not only food but also oil and explosives, and I acted accordingly. Thank the Gods it turned out to be correct. Let us change the subject.

"To tell you the truth I hate to talk about the war. Look, the sunset is lighting the peaks of the Himalayas. The Everest burns like a crucible of gold. Let us pray:





"'Lead me from the unreal to the Real,

From darkness into Light,

From sound into Silence.'"

After mediation was over, Ghond silently walked out of our house to begin a journey from Calcutta to the lamasery near Singalila. But before I recount his adventure there, I must tell the reader how Ghond happened to be transferred from the battlefields of France to our home.

The last part of February 1915, it became quite clear to the Bengal Regiment that Gay-Neck would fly no more. Ghond, who had brought him, was no soldier. With the exception of a tiger or a leopard, he had never killed anything in his life, and now that he too was sick, they were both invalided back to India together. They reached Calcutta in March. I could not believe my eyes when I saw them. Ghond looked as frightened as Gay-Neck, and both of them appeared very sick.

Ghond, after he had delivered my pigeon to me, explained a few matters, before he departed to the Himalayas. "I need to be healed of fear and hate. I saw too much killing of man by man. I was invalided home for I am sick with a fell disease—sickness of fear, and I must go alone to nature to be cured of my ill."

So he went up to Singalila, to the lamasery, there to be healed by prayer and meditation. In the meantime I tried my utmost to cure Gay-Neck. His wife and full-grown children failed to help him. His children saw in him but a stranger, for he showed no care for them, but his wife interested him intensely, though even she could not make him fly. He refused steadily to do anything but hop a little, and nothing would induce him to go up in the air. I had his wings and legs examined by good pigeon-doctors, who said that there was nothing wrong with him. His bones and both his wings were sound, yet he would not fly. He refused even to open his right wing; and whenever he was not running or hopping he developed the habit of standing on one foot.

I would not have minded that, if he and his wife had not set about nesting just then. Towards the middle of April, when vacation for the hot weather began, I received Ghond's letter. "Your Gay- Neck," he informed me, "should not nest yet. If there are eggs, destroy them. Do not let them hatch under any circumstances. A sick father like Gay-Neck—diseased with fright—cannot but give the world poor and sick baby pigeons. Bring him here. Before I close, I must say that I am better. Bring Gay-Neck soon; the holy lama wishes to see you and him. Besides, all the five swifts have arrived this week from the south; they will surely divert your pet bird."

I took Ghond's advice. I put Gay-Neck in one cage and his wife in another, and set out for the north.

How different the hills were in the spring from the previous autumn! Owing to the exigencies that had arisen, my parents had opened their house in Dentam months earlier than usual. After settling down there towards the last week of April, I took Gay-Neck along with me and set out in the company of a Tibetan caravan of ponies for Singalila, leaving his wife behind, so that if he were able to fly again he would return to her—just the thing needed to cure him. She was to be the drawing-card. He might do it, Ghond had hoped, in order to return and help her hatch the newly laid eggs, though the day after our departure my parents destroyed the eggs; for we did not want sick and degenerate children who would grow up to shame the name of Gay-Neck.

I carried my bird on my shoulder, where he perched all day. During the night we kept him safely locked up in his cage, which proved beneficial to him. Twelve hours of mountain air and light improved his body, yet not once did he make the effort to fly off my shoulder and return to his mate to help her hatch the eggs.

The Himalayas in the spring are unique. The ground glittered with white violets, interspersed with raspberries already ripening here and there in the hot moist gorges where the ferns were spreading their large arms as if to embrace the white hills lying like precious stones on the indigo-blue throat of the sky. Sometimes we passed through thick forests where stunted oaks, prodigious elms, deodars (cedars) and chestnuts grew in such numbers that their branches shut out all sunlight. Tree against tree; bough against bough, and roots struggling with roots fought for light and life. Below them in arboreal darkness many deer grazed on abundant tall grass and saplings, only to be devoured in their turn by tigers, leopards and panthers. Everywhere life grew in abundance, all the more intensifying the struggle for existence among birds, beasts and plants. Such is the self-contradictory nature of existence. Even insects were not free of it.

When we emerged from the forest darkness and beheld the open spaces, the hot tropical sunlight suddenly shot its diamond points of fire into our helpless eyes. The golden tremble of dragon-flies filled the air; butterflies, sparrows, robins, grouse, parrots, papias (Indian thrushes), jays and peacocks clamoured and courted from tree to tree and peak to higher peak.

Now in the open space between tea-gardens on one side of the road and pine-forests on our right, we strove and staggered up inclines almost as straight as knives. There the air was so rarefied that we could hardly breathe. Sounds and echoes travelled very far: even a whisper could not escape being overheard from a distance of yards, and men and beasts alike became silent. Save for the clatter of their hoofs the ponies as well as the men moved with a sense of reverence for the solitude and stillness that shut down upon us. Here the indigo-blue hollow of the sky remained untainted by clouds, and untroubled by any movement save the sighing flight of cranes going northwards, or the deep-toned plunge of an eagle into declivities nearby. Everything was cold, keen and quickening. Orchids burst out almost overnight and opened their purple eyes upon us; marigolds brimmed with morning dew, and in the lakes below, blue and white lotuses opened their petals to the bees.

Now we were near Singalila. The lamasery raised its head and beckoned us from the hillside. Its wing-shaped roof and ancient walls floated like a banner against the horizon. I was encouraged to quicken my pace, and another hour's time found me climbing the steep pathway of the monastery.

What a relief it was to be there among men who lived above the battle of our everyday life! It being noon, I went down with Ghond through a forest of balsam to the spring in which we bathed ourselves and gave Gay-Neck a thorough wash. After the bird had had his dinner in his cage, Ghond and I went to the dining- room where the lamas were waiting for us. The room looked like a colonnade of ebony whose capitals were decorated with dragons of gold. The teak-wood beams, grown quite dark through many centuries, were carved into broad clear lotus designs, as delicate as jasmine but as strong as metal. On the floor of red sandstone, orange-robed monks were seated in silent prayer, which was their grace before each meal. Ghond and I waited at the entrance of the dining-room until the prayer was concluded with the chanting in unison, like the Gregorian chant:





"Budham mē sáránām

Dhārmám mē sáránām

Ōm Man pádmē Ōm."



In Wisdom that is the Buddha is our refuge

In religion is our refuge

In the jewel of Truth (shining in the lotus of life) is our refuge.





Now I went forward and saluted the abbot, whose grave face wreathed with smiles as he blessed me. After I had saluted the rest of the lamas, Ghond and I took our seats at the table made up of a series of small wooden stools, which came up to our chests as we squatted on the floor. It was nice to sit on the cool floor after a very hot day's journey. Our meal was of lentil soup, fried potatoes and curried egg-plants. Since Ghond and I were vegetarians, we did not eat the eggs that were served at the table. Our drink consisted of hot green tea.

After dinner, the abbot invited Ghond and me to take our siesta in his company, and we climbed with him up to the topmost cliff, which was like an eagle's eyrie, over which grew a clump of firs, where we found a hard bare cell, without a stick of furniture anywhere, which I had never seen before. After we had seated ourselves there, the holy man said: "Here in the monastery we have prayed to Infinite Compassion twice every day for the healing of the nations of earth. Yet the war goes on, infecting even birds and beasts with fear and hate. Diseases of the emotions spread faster than the ills of the body. Mankind is going to be so loaded with fear, hate, suspicion and malice that it will take a whole generation before a new set of people can be reared completely free from them."

Infinite sadness furrowed the lama's hitherto unwrinkled brow, and the corners of his mouth drooped from sheer fatigue. Though he lived above the battle in his eagle's eyrie, he felt the burden of men's sins more grievously than those who had plunged the world into war.

But he resumed smiling: "Let us discuss Gay-Neck and Ghond who are with us. If you wish your pigeon to wing the serenity of the sky again, you must meditate on infinite courage, as Ghond has been doing for himself these many days."

"How, my Lord?" I asked eagerly. The abbot's yellow face suffused with colour; no doubt he was embarrassed by the directness of my question, and I felt ashamed. Directness, like hurry, is very sordid.

As if he knew my feeling, the lama in order to put me at my ease said: "Every dawn and sunset, seat Gay-Neck on your shoulder and say to yourself: 'Infinite courage is in all life. Each being that lives and breathes is a reservoir of infinite courage. May I be pure enough to pour infinite courage into those whom I touch!' If you do that for a while, one day your heart, mind and soul will become pure through and through. That instant the power of your soul, now without fear, without hate, without suspicion, will enter the pigeon and make him free. He who purifies himself to the greatest extent can put into the world the greatest spiritual force. Do what I advise you twice a day. All our lamas will help you. Let us see what comes of it!"

The lama, after a moment's silence, continued: "You have been told by Ghond, who knows animals better than any other man, that our fear frightens others so that they attack us. Your pigeon is so frightened that he thinks the whole sky is going to attack him. No leaf tumbles without frightening him. Not a shadow falls without driving panic into his soul. Yet what is causing him suffering is himself.

"At this very time the village below us—yes, you can see it over there to the north-west—is suffering from the same trouble as Gay-Neck. As it is the season for animals to come north, all the frightened inhabitants are going about with old matchlocks in order to kill wild beasts, and behold, the beasts attack them now, though they never did so before! Buffalo come and eat up their crops, and leopards steal their goats. Today news was brought here that a wild buffalo killed a man last night. Though I tell them to purge their minds of fear through prayer and meditation, they will not do it."

"Why, O blessed Teacher," asked Ghond, "do you not permit me to go and rid them of these beasts?"

"Not yet," replied the lama. "Though you are healed of fear in your waking moments, yet your dreams harbour the curse of fright. Let us pray and meditate a few days longer, and your soul will be purged of all such dross. Then after you are healed, if the villagers below are still hurt by the beasts, you may go and help them."





Chapter Nine The Wisdom of the Lama


After about the tenth day of strict and most sincere meditation in the manner he had prescribed, the lama sent for Gay-Neck and myself. So with the pigeon between my hands, I climbed up to his cell. The lama's face, generally yellow, today looked brown and very powerful. A strange poise and power shone in his almond-shaped eyes. He took Gay-Neck in his hands, and said:





May the north wind bring healing unto you,

May the south wind bring healing unto you,

May the winds of east and west pour healing into you.

Fear flees from you,

Hate flees from you,

And suspicion flees from you.

Courage like a rushing tide gallops through you;

Peace possesses your entire being,

And serenity and strength have become your two wings.

In your eyes shines courage;

Power and prowess dwell in your heart!

You are healed,

You are healed,

You are healed!

Peace, peace, peace.





We sat there meditating on those thoughts till the sun set, smiting the Himalayan peaks into multi-coloured flames. The valleys, the hollows and the woods about us put on a mantle of purple glory.

Slowly Gay-Neck hopped down from the lama's hands, walked out to the entrance of the cell and looked at the sunset. He opened his left wing, and waited. Then softly and ever so slowly he opened his right wing, feather by feather, muscle by muscle, until at last it spread out like a sail. Instead of doing anything theatrical such as instantly flying off, he carefully shut his two wings as if they were two precious but fragile fans. He too knew how to salute the sunset. With the dignity of a priest he walked downstairs, but hardly had he gone out of sight when I heard—I fancied I heard—the flapping of his wings. I was about to get up hastily and see what had really happened, but the holy man put his hand on my shoulder and restrained me while an inscrutable smile played on his lips.

The next morning I told Ghond what had happened. He replied tartly: "Gay-Neck opened his wings to salute the setting sun, you say. There is nothing surprising in that. Animals are religious, though man in his ignorance thinks they are not. I have seen monkeys, eagles, pigeons, leopards and even the mongoose adore the dawn and sunset."

"Can you show them to me?"

Ghond answered, "Yes. But not now; let us go and give Gay- Neck his breakfast."

When we reached his cage we found its door open—and no pigeon within. I was not surprised, for I had left the cage unlocked every night that we had been at the lamasery. But where had he gone? We could not find him in the main building, so we went to the library. There in a deserted outer cell we found some of his feathers, and nearby Ghond detected a weasel's footprints. That made us suspect trouble. But if the weasel had attacked and killed him, there would be blood on the floor. Then, whither had he fled? What had he done? Where was he now? We wandered for an hour. Just as we had decided to give up the search, we heard him cooing, and there he was on the roof of the library, talking to his old friends the Swifts, who were clinging to their nest under the eaves. We could make out their answer to his cooing. Mr. Swift said, "Cheep, cheep, cheep!" I cried to Gay-Neck in joy, and gave him his call to breakfast: "Aya— á—ay." He curved his neck, and listened. Then, as I called again, he saw me, and instantly flapped his wings loudly, then flew down and sat on my wrist, as cool as a cucumber. During the earliest dawn he must have heard the priests' footsteps going up to their morning meditation, and got out of his cage, then gone astray to the outer cell where no doubt a young and inexpert weasel had attacked him. A veteran like Gay-Neck could easily outwit the weasel by presenting him with a few feathers only. While the young hopeful was looking for the pigeon inside a lot of torn feathers, his would-be victim flew up into the sky. There he found his old friend Swift, flying to salute the rising sun. And after they had performed their morning worship together, they had come down for a friendly chat on the roof of the monastery library.

That day very terrible news reached the lamasery. A wild buffalo had attacked the village that the lama had spoken of the day before. He had come there during the previous evening and killed two people who were going home from a meeting of the village elders that was held around the communal threshing floor. The villagers had sent up a deputation to the abbot to say a prayer for the destruction of the beast and begging him to exorcise the soul out of the brute. The holy man said that he would use means that would kill the murderous buffalo in twenty-four hours. "Go home in peace, O beloved ones of Infinite Compassion. Your prayers will be answered. Do not venture out of doors after nightfall. Stay home and meditate on peace and courage." Ghond, who was present, asked, "How long has this fellow been pestering your village?" The entire deputation affirmed that he had been coming every night for a week. He had eaten up almost half of their spring crop. Again begging for strong and effective incantation and exorcism to kill the buffalo, they went down to their village.

After the deputation had left, the lama said to Ghond, who was standing by, "O chosen one of victory, now that you are healed, go forth to slay the murderer."

"But, my Lord!"

"Fear no more, Ghond. Your meditations have healed you. Now test in the woods what you have acquired here by this means. In solitude men gain power and poise that they must test in the multitude. Ere the sun sets twice from now, you shall return victorious. As an earnest of my perfect faith in your success, I request you to take this boy and his pigeon with you. Surely I would not ask you to take a boy of sixteen with you if I doubted your powers or the outcome of your mission. Go, bring the murderer to justice."

That afternoon we set out for the jungle. I was overjoyed at the prospect of spending at least one night in there again. What a pleasure it was to go with Ghond and the pigeon, both whole and well once more, in quest of a wild buffalo! Is there any boy on earth who would not welcome such an opportunity?

So, thoroughly equipped with rope ladders, a lasso and knives, with Gay-Neck on my shoulder, we set out. The British Government forbids the use of firearms to the common people of India, and so we carried no rifles.

About three in the afternoon we reached the village north- west of the lamasery. There we took up the trail of the buffalo. We followed it through dense woods and wide clearings. Here and there we crossed a brook or had to climb over mammoth fallen trees. It was extraordinary how clear the buffalo's hoof-prints were, and how deep!

Ghond remarked: "He must have been frightened to death, for see how heavily he had trodden here. Animals in their normal unafraid state leave very little trace behind, but when frightened, they act as if the terror of being killed weighed their bodies down. This fellow's hoofs have made prodigious and clear marks wherever he went. How frightened he must have been!"

At last we reached an impassable river. Its current, according to Ghond, was sharp enough to break our legs had we stepped into it. Strangely enough, the buffalo too had not dared to cross it. So we followed his precedent, looking for more hoof-prints on the bank. In twenty more minutes we found that they swerved off the stream bank and disappeared into a thick jungle that looked as black as a pit, although it was hardly five in the afternoon. This place could not have been more than half an hour's run from the village, for a wild buffalo of any age.

Ghond asked, "Do you hear the song of the water?" After listening for several minutes I heard the sound of water kissing the sedges, and other grass not far off, with gurgling groaning sounds. We were about twenty feet from a lake into which the river ran. "The murderous buffalo is hiding—probably asleep somewhere between here and the lagoon," cried Ghond. "Let us make our home on one of the twin trees yonder. It is getting dark, and I am sure he will be here soon. We should not be found on the floor of the jungle when he turns up. There is hardly a space of four feet between the trees!"

His last words struck me as curious. So I examined the space between the trees. They were tall and massive, and between them lay a piece of earth just broad enough to afford room for both of us walking abreast of each other.

"Now I shall lay down my fear-soaked tunic half-way between these Twins." Then Ghond proceeded to take from under his tunic a bundle of old clothes that he had been wearing until today. He placed them on the ground, then climbed one of the trees. After Ghond had gone up, he swung down a rope ladder for me. I climbed up on it with Gay-Neck fluttering and beating his wings on my shoulders in order to keep his balance. Both of us safely reached the branch on which Ghond was sitting, and since the evening was coming on apace, we sat still for a while.

The first thing I noticed as the dusk fell was bird-life. Herons, hornbills, grouse, pheasant, song-sparrows and emerald flocks of parrots seemed to infest the forest. The drone of the bee, the cut-cut- cut of the woodpecker and the shrill cry of the eagle far overhead blended with the tearing, crying noises of the mountain torrent and the staccato laughter of the already waking hyenas.

The tree on which we made our home for the night was very tall. We went farther up in order to make sure that no leopard or serpent was above us. After a close inspection we chose a couple of branches between which we hung our rope ladder in the shape of a strong hammock. Just as we had made ourselves secure on our perch, Ghond pointed to the sky. I looked up at once. There floated on wings of ruby a very large eagle. Though darkness was rising like a flood from the floor of the jungle, in the spaces above the sky burned "like a pigeon's throat," and through it circled again and again that solitary eagle who was no doubt, according to Ghond, performing his worship of the setting sun. His presence had already had a stilling effect on the birds and insects of the forest. Though he was far above them, yet like a congregation of mute worshippers, they kept silent while he, their King, flew backwards and forwards, and vaulted before their God, the Father of Lights, with the ecstasy of a hierophant. Slowly the ruby fire ebbed from his wings. Now they became purple sails fringed with sparks of gold. As if his adoration was at last concluded, he rose higher and, as an act of self- immolation before his deity, flew towards the flaming peaks burning with fire, and vanished in their splendour like a moth.

Below, a buffalo's bellowing unlocked the insect voices one by one, tearing into shreds and tatters the stillness of the evening. An owl hooted near by, making Gay-Neck snuggle closely to my heart under my tunic. Suddenly the Himalayan Doël, a night-bird, very much like a nightingale, flung abroad its magic song. Like a silver flute blown by a God, trill upon trill, cadenza upon cadenza, spilled its torrential peace that rushed like rain down the boughs of the trees, dripping over their rude barks to the floor of the jungle, then through their very roots into the heart of the earth.

The enchantment of an early summer night in the Himalayas will remain forever indescribable. In fact it was so sweet and lonely that I felt very sleepy. Ghond put an extra rope around me that held me secure to the trunk of the tree. Then I put my head on his shoulder in order to sleep comfortably. But before I did so, he told me of his plan:

"Those cast-off garments of mine are what I wore while my heart was possessed of fear. They have a strange odour. If that brother-in-law (idiot) of a buffalo gets their scent, he will come hither. He who is frightened responds to the odour of fear. If he comes to investigate my cast-off dress, we shall do what we can to him. I hope we can lassoo and take him home as tame as a heifer…" I did not hear the rest of his words, for I had fallen asleep.

I do not know how long I slept, but suddenly I was roused by a terrific bellowing. When I opened my eyes, Ghond, who was already awake, undid the rope around me and pointed below. In the faint light of the dawn at first I saw nothing, but I heard distinctly the groaning and grunting of an angry beast. In the tropics the day breaks rapidly. I looked down most intently. Now in the growing light of day I saw…There could be no two opinions about what I saw. Yes, there was a hillock of shining jet rubbing its dark side against the tree on which we sat. It was about ten feet long, I surmised, though half of its bulk was covered by the leaves and boughs of the trees. The beast looked like a black opal coming out of a green furnace, such was the glitter of the newly grown foliage under the morning sun. I thought, "The buffalo that in nature looks healthy and silken, in a zoo is a mangy creature with matted mane and dirty skin. Can those who see buffalo in captivity ever conceive how beautiful they can be? What a pity that most young people instead of seeing one animal in nature—which is worth a hundred in any zoo-must derive their knowledge of God's creatures from their appearance in prisons! If we cannot perceive any right proportion of man's moral nature by looking at prisoners in a jail, how do we manage to think that we know all about an animal by gazing at him penned in a cage?"

However, to return to that murderous buffalo at the foot of our tree. Gay-Neck was freed from under my tunic and left to roam on the tree, which Ghond and I descended by a number of branches, like the rungs of a ladder, till we reached a branch that was about two feet above the buffalo. He did not see us. Ghond swiftly tied around the tree-trunk one end of the long lassoo. I noticed that the buffalo was playing underneath by putting his horns now and then through a tattered garment, what was left of Ghond's clothes. No doubt the odour of man in them had attracted him. Though his horns were clean, there were marks of fresh blood on his head. Apparently he had gone to the village and killed another person during the night. That roused Ghond. He whispered into my ear: "We shall get him alive. You slip this lassoo over his horns from above." In a trice Ghond had leaped off the branch near the rear of the buffalo. That startled the beast. But he could not turn round, for close to his right was a tree that I mentioned before, and to his left was the tree on which I stood. He had to go back or forward between the twins in order to get out from them, but before this happened I had flung the lassoo over his head. The touch of the rope acted like electricity upon him. He hastened backwards, in order to slip off the lassoo, so fast that Ghond, had he not already gone around the next tree, would have been trampled and cut to death by the sharp hoofs of the beast. But now, to my utter consternation, I noticed that instead of gripping his two horns at the very root, I had succeeded in lassoing only one of them. That instant I shrieked to Ghond in terror: "Beware! Only one of his horns is caught. The rope may slip off that one any time. Run! Run up a tree."

But that intrepid hunter ignored my advice. Instead he stood facing the enemy a short distance away from him. Then I saw the brute lower his head and plunge forward. I shut my eyes in terror. When I opened them again, I saw that the bull was tugging at the rope that held him by the horn and kept him from butting into the tree behind which Ghond stood. His monstrous bellowing filled the jungle with a fearful racket. Echoes of it coursed one after another like frightened shrieking children.

Since the bull had not yet succeeded in reaching him, Ghond drew his razor-sharp dagger, about a foot and a half long and two inches broad. He slowly slipped behind another tree to the right, then vanished out of sight. The bull just ran straight at the spot where he had seen Ghond last. Fortunately, the rope was still clinging tightly to his horn.

Here Ghond changed his tactics. He ran away in the opposite direction, zigzagging in between different trees. This he did to go where his odour could not reach the bull, blown down to him by the wind. But though he was bewildered, yet the bull turned and followed. He again saw the bundle of Ghond's clothes on the ground under our tree. That maddened him. He sniffed, and then worried it with his horns.

By now Ghond was down wind. Though I could not see him, I surmised that he could tell by the odour where the bull was in case the trees hid him from view. The beast bellowed again, as he put his horns through Ghond's clothes, which raised a terrific tumult in the trees all around. From nowhere came flocks of monkeys running from branch to branch. Squirrels ran like rats from trees to the jungle-floor, then back again. Swarms of birds, such as jays, herons and parrots, were flying about and shrieking in unison with crows, owls and kites. Suddenly the bull charged again. I saw that Ghond was standing there calmly facing him. If ever I saw a man as calm as calmness itself, it was Ghond. The bull's hind legs throbbed and swept on like swords. Then something happened. He reared in the air; no doubt it was the pull of the lassoo rope, of which one end was tied to our tree. He rose several feet above the ground, then fell. That instant, like a dry twig snapped by a child, his horn cracked and flew up in the air. The breaking created an irresistible momentum that flung him sideways on the ground. He almost rolled over, his legs kicking the air violently. Instantly Ghond leaped forward like a spark from the flint. Seeing him, the buffalo balanced himself and sat on his haunches, snorting. He almost succeeded in rising to his feet, but Ghond struck near his shoulder with the dagger. Its deadly edge dug deep, and Ghond pressed on it with his entire weight. A bellow like a volcanic eruption shook the jungle, and with it a fountain of liquid ruby spurted up. Unable to bear the sight any longer, I again shut my eyes.

In a few minutes, when I came down from my perch, I found that the buffalo had died of a haemorrhage. It lay in a deep pool of blood. And near by sat Ghond on the ground, wiping himself from the stain of his encounter. I knew that he wished to be left alone. So I went to the old tree and called to Gay-Neck. He made no response. I went all the way up to the topmost branch of the tree. But in vain— he was not there.

When I came down, Ghond had cleansed himself. He pointed at the sky. We beheld nature's scavengers. Kites below, and far above them vultures flew. They had already learned that someone had died and they must clean up the jungle.

Ghond said: "We shall find the pigeon in the monastery. He flew with the rest of the birds, doubtless. Let us depart hence soon." But before starting homeward, I went to measure the dead buffalo, to whom flies had been swarming from every direction. He was ten feet and a half in length, and his forelegs measured over three feet.

Our trudge back towards the monastery was made in silence that was broken only when, about noonday, we had reached the stricken village and informed its headman that their enemy was dead. He was relieved to hear of it, though he was very sad because during the previous evening the buffalo had killed his aged mother, who was going to the village temple to her worship before sunset.

We were very hungry and walked fast, and soon we reached the monastery. At once I made inquiries about my pigeon. Gay- Neck was not there! It was terrible. But the old holy man said, as we chatted in his cell, "He is safe as are you, Ghond." After a pause of several minutes he asked, "What is troubling your peace of mind?"

The old hunter thought out quietly what he was going to say. "Nothing, my Lord, save this: I hate to kill anything. I wanted to catch that bull alive, and alas! I had to destroy him. When the horn of his broke, and there was nothing between him and me, I had to put my knife through a vital vein. I am so sorry I could not get him alive in order to sell him to a zoo."

"O you soul of commercialism!" I exclaimed. "I am not sorry that the bull died. Better death than to be caged for the rest of his life in a zoo. Real death is preferable to living death."

"If you had only slipped the lassoo over both horns!" Ghond retorted.

The holy one ejaculated, "Both of you should be concerned about Gay-Neck, not about what is already dead."

Ghond said, "True. Let us search for him on the morrow."

But the holy one replied: "No. Return to Dentam, my son. Your family is anxious about you. I hear their thoughts."

The next day we left for Dentam on a pair of ponies. By forced march and changing ponies twice a day at different posts, we reached Dentam in three day's time. As we were going up towards our house, we encountered a very excited servant of my family. He said that Gay-Neck had returned three days before. But since we had not come back with him, my parents had begun to worry, and they had sent out parties searching after us, alive or dead.

He and I almost ran up to the house. In another ten minutes my mother's arms were around me, and Gay-Neck, with his feet on my head, was fluttering his wings in order to balance himself.

I cannot begin to describe how overjoyed I was to hear that Gay-Neck had flown at last. He had winged all the way from the lamasery to our home in Dentam. He had not faltered or failed! "O thou soul of flight, thou pearl among pigeons," I exclaimed to myself as Ghond and I accelerated our steps.

Thus ended our pilgrimage to Singalila. It healed both Gay- Neck and Ghond of the disease of fear and hate that they had caught on the battle-fields. No labor would be in vain if it could heal a single soul of these worst ills of life.

Instead of spinning out a sermon at the end of this story, let me say this:

"Whatever we think and feel will colour what we say or do. He who fears, even unconsciously, or has his least little dream tainted with hate, will inevitably, sooner or later, translate these two qualities into his action. Therefore, my brothers, live courage, breathe courage and give courage. Think and feel love so that you will be able to pour out of yourselves peace and serenity as naturally as a flower gives forth fragrance.

"Peace be unto all!"
