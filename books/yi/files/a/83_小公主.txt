译者前言


本书作者弗朗西丝·霍奇森·伯内特（1849—1924）出生于英国曼彻斯特一个殷实的五金厂主家庭。1853年她的父亲去世，后因工厂倒闭，生计困难，于1865年举家移居美国。从十几岁起，弗朗西丝便开始撰写小说和故事，1877年她的长篇小说《劳莉的那个少女》出版，获得成功。她一生共写了四十多部作品，最著名的、为她赢得巨大声誉的当数《小爵爷》《小公主》和《秘密花园》三部小说。这些作品多多少少都留有作者对儿时在英格兰生活的追忆和怀念，是英美两国乃至世界儿童文学宝库中难得的佳作。

《小公主》自1905年成书以来，一个世纪中一版再版，多次被改编成舞台剧，屡演不衰，先后拍成无声和有声电影，曾由天才童星秀兰·邓波儿主演，风靡一时，1995年重拍时更被评为20世纪90年代最佳儿童影片。正是《小公主》那种富有传奇色彩的故事情节，主人公萨拉坚守内心秘密和在逆境中对生活始终如一的勇气与充满幻想的精神品格，使之具有独特的魅力，吸引了一代代读者。

萨拉·克鲁生长于一个富有的英国驻印度青年军官家庭，从小虽过着丰衣足食的富贵生活，但小小年纪，不仅心地善良，有一颗爱心，且少年老成，通达人情。十一岁时，面对父亲突然死亡、家道中落的命运重大变故，从一位在学校里享有优越地位的“特殊生”沦落成干杂活的“小苦力”，受尽凌辱和苦难，她没有向命运低头，而凭着自己生动的想象力和宽广的胸襟积极面对惨淡的人生，始终保持一颗纯真、仁慈的公主之心。

萨拉之所以被人尊为“公主”，她也自奉为“公主”，不是因为她拥有巨额家财，更重要的是她具有迷人的人格魅力和善良、仁慈的精神世界。正如她自己所说：“如果我是位穿着破衣烂衫的公主，那我是个精神上的公主。穿金戴银时当个公主固然轻而易举，但默默无闻时始终保持一颗公主的心难道不是更大的胜利吗？”她身上最显著的一大特点就是她有一颗爱心；她眼中最容不得的就是虚伪、势利和粗野。所以唯利是图的“高级寄宿女校”的校长明卿小姐第一眼就给她留下恶劣的印象，此后两人的矛盾和冲突便贯穿始终。反之，她对洛蒂和埃芒加德充满关怀和帮助；在自己饿得头昏眼花的时候，把面包分给比自己更饿的小乞丐安妮；对印度绅士的眷念和关切——凡此种种无不出于她对弱者的同情之心。尤其是她与在厨房干粗活的贝基之间牢固而纯真的友谊，更写得凄凉婉转，催人泪下。如果说萨拉落难之前对贝基只是出于怜悯之心，那么当她沦落为“小苦力”后，两人之间便是同病相怜，几乎是有难同当，有福同享，表现出这两个人虽然地位悬殊，却都具有仁爱之心的高贵品德。萨拉的爱心甚至遍及窗外觅食的麻雀，室内养家的老鼠以及邻居家的猴子。作者说得好：“如果说她成为施予者是天性使然，那么她生性就是慷慨的，心灵也是善良的。即便有时你一无所有，你的心灵始终是充实的，你可以随时以心灵施予他人温暖、友善和美好的东西——帮助、慰藉和笑声——有时候恰恰是快乐和友善的笑声对人帮助最大。”

萨拉所具有的显著性格特征就是她自己所说的“假装”（pretend）或“假设”（suppose），也就是通常意义上的“幻想”或“想象”，这是她在艰难困苦时的生活动力，是面对多舛命运所表现出的勇气的源泉。她把寒冷而光秃秃的阁楼想象成铺着华丽地毯、炉火熊熊、图书满架、灯光灿烂的厅堂，为凄清孤独的生活抹上一丝亮色；她处处把自己看作是“公主”，处处要彬彬有礼，时时要善心待人，以此来衡量自己的言行。不论是得意之时，还是遭遇厄运之年，她始终表现出从容优雅的翩翩风度、宽容与乐观的精神境界。她把凄冷的阁楼“假装”成巴士底监狱，把自己“设想”为狱中的罪犯，以此来考验自己，以获得生活的勇气和信心。萨拉用“他”或“她”指代猴子、麻雀、老鼠和洋娃娃，因为在她的心目中，它们都是自己的朋友。她认为世间万物可以凭一种不用语言也不用文字的特别媒介便可相互沟通。凭着丰富的想象力，萨拉把洋娃娃爱米丽看作是能说话、能走路的伴侣，彼此互诉衷肠，以排遣内心的孤独和痛苦。应该说，萨拉的“假装”和“假设”是积极的，是她在艰难困苦的境遇中乐观向上精神的体现。

《小公主》虽然是部儿童小说，通过描述一个女孩在寄宿学校里短短数年间大起大落命运的变化经历，颂扬不向苦难低头的高尚精神境界，但成年人看了无不得到心灵的净化，人生真谛的启迪，唤起弃恶从善的心愿。





一　萨拉


从前，一个昏暗的冬日，沉沉黄雾重锁伦敦街头。虽说是大白天，路灯点亮了，商店里橱窗内也是汽灯通明。这时候一个样子古怪的小女孩跟着父亲一起坐在出租马车里，正缓缓地从一条大街驶过。

小姑娘坐着，两腿蜷缩，身子靠着父亲，依偎在他的胳膊窝里。小姑娘凝视着车窗外路过的行人，一对大眼睛透出一种若有所思而老成的神情，显得煞是古怪。

小小的女孩，谁也想不到在她那张小脸上会见到这样的表情。这等老气横秋的神情即便在十二岁的孩子脸上也不多见，更何况萨拉·克鲁只有七岁。但是，事实上，她总是耽于梦想之中，满脑子尽想着奇里古怪的事，她觉得自己时时刻刻都在思索着大人的事情，思索着属于大人的世界。她觉得自己好像已经活了好久好久了。

此时此刻，她正在回想着和父亲克鲁上尉一起刚刚从孟买回国的这一段航程的事。她在想着那艘大船，想起船上那些一言不发、来往穿梭的印度水手，想到火辣辣的甲板上玩耍的孩子，还有一些年轻的军官太太，她们老变着法儿逗她说话，听了无不笑个不停。

不过她想得最多的是，觉得这世界真是稀奇古怪：自己刚刚还在烈日炎炎的印度，转眼便置身在海洋之中，然后又坐在一辆陌生的马车里，行驶在陌生的街道上，这里的大白天黑得如同夜晚，在她看来这事儿太不可思议了，迷惑中禁不住朝父亲挨得更近些。

“爸爸，”她说话的声音很轻、很小，像是耳语，并带有几分神秘，“爸爸。”

“什么事，小宝贝？”克鲁上尉说着，把她搂得更近，低头打量她的脸蛋，“萨拉，你在想什么？”

“这就是那个地方吗？”萨拉低声问道，蜷缩着身子朝父亲挨得更近了，“是吗，爸爸？”

“不错，小萨拉，是这儿。我们终于到了。”她虽然只有七岁，却知道父亲说这话的时候心里很不是滋味。

她一向把这里称作“那个地方”。在她看来，很多年以前父亲就开始让她做好思想准备来这里了。她刚出生时母亲就死了，所以母亲并没有在她心上留下什么印象，萨拉从来没有想念过她。她父亲年轻、英俊、富有，一向疼爱她，似乎是她世上唯一的亲人。父女俩总是一起玩，相互关爱。她听人家说起，才知道父亲很有钱，当时他们以为她没有把这话放在心里呢。她还听到他们说等她长大了也会富有。不过她完全不明白“富有”是什么意思。此前，她一直住在一座漂亮的平房里，看惯了众多仆人对她行额手礼，称她“尊贵的小姐”，对她百依百顺。她总有许多玩具、宠物和一个对她恭敬有加的保姆，她这才慢慢意识到，这些东西只有富贵人家才有。然而，她对“富贵”的了解仅此而已。

在她短短的人生里，只有一件事困扰着她，那就是有朝一日她要被送到“那个地方”去。印度的气候不利于孩子的健康，一有可能他们就把她送走——一般是去英格兰，去上学。她看到过别的孩子离去，听到过他们的父母谈论收到他们来信的事。她已经知道自己也必须得去，尽管有时候父亲说起有关海上航行和那个陌生国家的事引起她的兴趣，但想到从此父亲再也不能和自己守在一起，便感到十分难受。

“你就不能和我一起去那个地方吗，爸爸？”她五岁的时候问过他，“你就不能也去上学吗？我会帮助你做功课的。”

“不会让你待很久的，小萨拉。”他总这么说，“你去的是一座漂亮的房子，那里有很多小姑娘，你们一起玩，我会给你寄许许多多的书，你会很快长大，用不到一年你就长得又高又聪明，到时候回来好照顾爸爸了。”

她巴不得哩。为父亲照看家务，和他一起骑马，举行宴会的时候她就坐在餐桌女主人席上，和他聊天儿，读他的书——那是世上她最喜爱做的事，要是非去英格兰的“那个地方”才能称心如意，那她就得下定决心去一趟了。那边有没有别的小姑娘她并不在乎，只要有足够的书她就心满意足了。她爱书胜过一切，事实上，她一直暗自编织美丽的故事，自我欣赏。有时候也讲给父亲听，他和她一样喜欢那些故事。

“嗯，爸爸，”她轻声说，“既然我们已到了这儿，想来只好听天由命了。”

听她说话这样老成，他禁不住笑了起来，亲了亲她。他自己丝毫不愿听天由命，不过他知道，这话是不能说出来的。这个古怪有趣的小萨拉，活是个小人精，一向是他的好伙伴儿。但是日后当他返回印度，回到那座大平房，明知道从此再也见不到那个穿着白裙子的小人儿前来迎接他了，想来那时该多孤单呀。想到此，他把她紧紧地搂在怀里。说话间，出租马车驶进了那个大而阴沉的广场，广场上矗立着一所房子，那就是他俩此行的目的地。

那是一幢阴沉沉的大砖房，和左右那一排房子一模一样，所不同的是在前门有一块闪闪发亮的铜牌，上面刻着几个黑字：

明卿小姐

高级女子寄宿学校

“我们到了，萨拉。”克鲁上尉说，说得口气尽可能轻松愉快。他把女儿从出租马车里抱下来，两个人双双登上台阶，按了铃。后来，萨拉经常想到：这幢房子不知为什么跟明卿小姐非常相像。房子样子体面，陈设精良，可是屋内的东西件件极为丑陋，就连每一把扶手椅子里都像长着硬邦邦的骨头。大厅里的每样东西无不硬邦邦的，擦得精光锃亮——甚至立在角落里个头高高的钟，上面的圆月形的红色钟面的边框，也经过精心擦拭，板出一副严厉的脸孔。父女俩被领入起居室，里面铺着地毯，上面的图案是方形的，椅子也是方形的，厚重的大理石炉台上摆着一架笨重的大理石座钟。

萨拉在一把硬邦邦的桃花心木椅上坐下，迅速地扫视了周围一眼。

“我不喜欢，爸爸，”她说道，“不过，我敢说士兵——即使是勇敢的士兵——其实并不是真的心甘情意去打仗的。”

克鲁上尉听罢放声大笑起来。他年轻，人挺风趣，对萨拉发表的一些奇谈怪论向来很爱听。

“噢，小萨拉，”他说，“一旦没有人对我说一本正经的话，我该如何是好？谁也不像你这么一本正经的了。”

“那么一本正经的话干吗让你笑成这副模样？”萨拉问。

“因为你说的时候好玩极了。”他答道，笑得更欢了。笑着、笑着，他猛地把她搂进怀里，深情地亲她，笑声随之戛然而止，泪珠儿在他眼眶里打转。

说话间，明卿小姐进了起居室。萨拉觉得明卿小姐活像她的房子：高大、阴森、体面而丑陋。她生就一双冷漠而呆滞的大眼睛，脸上露出冷漠而呆滞的笑容。她一看到萨拉和克鲁上尉，立刻喜笑颜开起来。是一位女士把她的学校推荐给了克鲁上尉，而明卿小姐又从那位女士口中听到不少关于这个年轻军官令人求之不得的好事，其中就有：据说他是个很有钱的父亲，愿意在自己的小女儿身上花大把大把的钱。

“能接纳这么一个漂亮且前途无量的孩子，那是我莫大的荣幸，克鲁上尉。”她说着，拿起萨拉的手抚摸起来，“梅雷狄斯女士跟我说过，这孩子聪明过人。在我这样的学校里，聪明的孩子可都是无价之宝。”

萨拉默默地站着，眼睛盯着明卿小姐的脸，脑子里照例冒出些怪念头。

“她干吗说我是个漂亮的孩子？”她心想，“我压根不漂亮。上校格兰吉的小女儿伊莎贝尔，那才叫漂亮哩。她有一对酒窝，红扑扑的脸蛋儿，长长的金发。可我呢，头发又黑又短，眼睛是绿色的。这还不算，我还长得瘦瘦的，压根算不上漂亮。我见过的孩子里，哪个都比我漂亮。瞧她一开始就瞎编一气了。”

不对，她可不是如她自己想的那样是个难看的孩子。她跟伊莎贝儿·格兰吉确实不一样，人家是军团之花，可她有她自己独特的魅力。她身材苗条、行动灵巧，像她这样小小年纪的孩子，她的个子算是高的。她那张小脸儿充满着活力，挺逗人爱。她满头的浓发乌黑发亮，只在发梢卷了起来。不错，她的眼睛确实是灰中带绿，但是长得大大的，很美，又有长长的黑睫毛，尽管她自己不喜欢灰绿色的眼睛，可很多别的人喜欢。然而她认定了自己是个难看的小姑娘，所以明卿小姐的一番奉承话丝毫没有使她动心。

“如果我说明卿小姐长得美，那我是在瞎编乱造。”她想，“我应该知道自己在瞎编乱造。我相信自己长得和她一样丑——只是丑得不一样罢了。她干吗要说我漂亮呢？”

后来，在认识明卿小姐稍久之后，她才明白对方为什么当时要说这样的话。她发现，每逢哪个爸爸、妈妈把自己的孩子领到她的学校来时，明卿小姐都要对他们说一模一样的话。

萨拉紧挨父亲站着，听着他和明卿小姐说话。原来她被领到这个女子学校来，是因为梅雷狄斯女士的两个小女孩也在这里念过书，而克鲁上尉非常尊重梅雷狄斯女士的经验。萨拉将成为所谓的“特殊生”，将享有比别的特殊生更特殊的待遇：她会有自己专用的漂亮卧室和起居室，有一匹矮脚马、一辆马车，一名女仆代替在印度的保姆来照顾她。

“她的学业丝毫用不着我操心，”克鲁上尉爽朗地笑道，同时握着萨拉的手轻轻拍着，“我担心的倒是别让她学得太快太多了。这孩子一向就爱坐着埋头钻进书本里。她哪像个小姑娘在读书，明卿小姐，她倒像只小狼，在贪婪地吞书哩。她一拿到新书总是如饥似渴地狼吞虎咽起来。她想读大人的书——又大又厚的大部头——法语书、德语书还有英语书——历史、传记、诗歌，各种各样的玩意儿。要是见她读得太多，就把她从书堆里拖开。让她去海德公园林荫大道骑骑马，要么去买个新的洋娃娃。她应该多和洋娃娃玩。”

“爸爸，”萨拉说，“你瞧，要是我每隔几天就出去买一个新洋娃娃，那就会多得让我喜欢不过来了。洋娃娃应该是来做我亲密的朋友。爱米丽会成为我亲密朋友的。”

克鲁上尉说罢看了看明卿小姐，明卿小姐也看了看克鲁上尉。

“谁是爱米丽？”她问。

“告诉她，萨拉。”克鲁上尉笑着说。

萨拉回答的时候，灰绿的眼睛显得很庄重，且相当柔和。

“是个洋娃娃，我还没有得到哩。”她说，“是爸爸要给我买的洋娃娃。我们要一起去找到她。我已经给她取好了名字，管她叫爱米丽。等爸爸走了，她就会成为了我的朋友。我要跟她说说爸爸的事儿。”

明卿小姐那张堆满呆板笑容的脸显得越发媚态十足了。

“多有想象力的孩子！”她说，“多讨人爱的小姑娘！”

“是啊，”克鲁上尉说着，把萨拉拉得更近，“她是个人见人爱的小丫头。替我好好照顾她，明卿小姐。”

萨拉和她父亲在旅馆一起待了几天；实际上，在父亲坐船回印度前她一直守在父亲身边。他们一起出门，逛了很多家大商店，买了许许多多东西。说真的，他俩买下的东西大大超出萨拉的需要，但是克鲁上尉是个冲动而率真的年轻人，只要是他女儿喜欢的，还有他自己喜欢的东西，他全都买下来。这也买，那也买，结果买回来一大堆东西，内中有些行头太华丽了，完全不适合一个七岁孩子的需要。有华贵的皮毛镶边的天鹅绒长裙，镶花边的衣裙，绣花的衣裙，好几顶帽子——插着又长又软的鸵鸟羽毛，貂皮大衣和暖手筒，一盒盒的小手套、小手绢、真丝长袜，数量之多，惊得柜台后彬彬有礼的年轻女士们交头接耳议论起来，以为这个长着一对大眼睛、目光严肃的奇怪小女孩，一准是哪个外国的公主——该是印度王公的小女儿吧。

最后他们到底把爱米丽找到了。他们跑了许多家玩具店，看过不少洋娃娃之后才发现了它。

“我想要她看起来真的不像个洋娃娃，”她说，“我希望她像真的在听我说话。爸爸，一般的洋娃娃糟就糟在——”她把头一歪，想了想，接着说，“糟就糟在一般的洋娃娃看起来从来就不会听人说话。”于是他们看遍了大的、小的、黑眼睛的、蓝眼睛的、棕色卷发的、金色辫子的、穿衣服的、没穿衣服的。

“你看，”他们查看一个没有穿衣服的洋娃娃后，她说，“要是当我找到她的时候，她没穿外衣，可以带她去裁缝那里，做件合身的让她穿上。衣服试过后会更合身。”

多次失望后，他们决定不坐车，边走边看橱窗，让出租马车跟着他们。他们已经经过两三家，店门都没进，他们正朝一家铺面不算大的商店走去，就在这时，萨拉突然吃了一惊，跳了起来，紧紧抓住父亲的胳膊。

“噢，爸爸！”她嚷道，“爱米丽在那儿！”

她的脸上顿时泛起一片红晕，灰绿的眼睛闪闪发亮，仿佛她刚刚认出某个心仪已久的老朋友。

“她真的在等着咱们！”她说，“进去见她吧。”

“老天爷！”克鲁上尉说，“我觉得好像得找个人给介绍介绍才是。”

“那你来介绍我，再让我来介绍你吧。”萨拉说，“我一见就认出她来了——所以她也许也认出我来了。”

洋娃娃也许真的已经认出她了。你看萨拉把它抱在怀里时，它的眼睛里确实露出一种灵性。这是个大洋娃娃，但不至于大到碍手碍脚、难抱的地步；它有一头金棕色的天然卷发，斗篷般披散在身后，它灰蓝色的眼睛深邃而澄澈，睫毛柔软浓密，是真正的睫毛，而不是画上去的。

“准是，”萨拉说着，把它放到膝盖上，打量它的脸，“准是，爸爸，这准是爱米丽。”

于是爱米丽被买了下来，当真被带到一家童装店，量身定做了和萨拉一样华丽的一套行头。它也有花边长裙，料子有天鹅绒的，也有细棉布的，有帽子、外套、美丽的镶花边的内衣、手套、手绢、皮毛衣服，等等。

“我想让她看起来始终像有个好妈妈的孩子，”萨拉说，“我是她的妈妈，不过也要她陪我做个伴儿。”

这次购物原本让克鲁上尉觉得是一次莫大的快事，但是离愁别绪不断地折磨他的心。这一切都意味着他将要和他心爱的古怪小女儿分开了。

那天他半夜里从床上起来，走过去站着低头端详睡在床上的萨拉，只见她把爱米丽抱在怀里，睡得正香。她的黑头发披散在枕头上，与爱米丽金色头发搅在一起，她们两个都有皱褶花边的睡袍，两个都有长长的睫毛，耷拉在脸蛋上。爱米丽看上去像个真正的孩子，有它做伴，克鲁上尉觉得欣慰，便深深叹了一口气，孩子似的捻了捻胡须。

“嗨，嗨，小萨拉！”他自言自语道，“我想你准不知道爸爸会多么想念你。”

第二天他把女儿带到明卿小姐那里，把她留在那里。一大早他就要启程离开了。他交代明卿小姐说，他的律师事务所的巴罗先生与斯基普沃思先生一向代理他在英国的事务，明卿小姐有什么问题找他们好了。只需把账单送去，他们会支付萨拉开销的。他自己每周会给萨拉写两封信，对萨拉要做到有求必应。

“她是个懂事的小丫头，凡是有害的东西她一向不会开口要的。”

然后父女俩双双走进萨拉的小小起居室，相互道别。萨拉坐在他膝盖上，小手紧紧抓着他大衣的翻领，久久凝视父亲的脸。

“你会把我记在心里吗，小萨拉？”他问，抚摸着她的头发。

“不，”她说，“我早已把你记在心里了。你就活在我心里。”说罢父女俩伸出手相拥，亲吻，仿佛永远不想让对方离开。

出租马车离开大门，萨拉就坐在自己起居室的地板上，双手托着下巴，目光追随着马车，直到车子在广场的一角拐了弯才转过身来。爱米丽坐在她身旁，也目送着马车离去。明卿小姐差妹妹艾米丽亚小姐去看孩子在做什么，但怎么也打不开门。

“我把门锁上了，”里面传出一个奇怪而有礼貌的小孩声音，“如果您允许的话，我想一个人安静待一会儿。”

艾米丽亚小姐又矮又胖，对自己的姐姐又敬又怕。论心地，在两姐妹中，她算是比较善良的，但是她对明卿小姐始终言听计从。她又回到楼下，显得惊惶失措。

“我从来没有见过这么古怪、这么老成的孩子，姐姐，”她说，“她把自己反锁了起来，不吵也不闹。”

“有的孩子又踢又叫的，她这样好多了，”明卿小姐回答，“我原以为像她这么个惯坏了的孩子会把整个房子闹个底朝天的。要说世上有哪个孩子万事可以随心所欲的话，那准是她。”

“我打开过她的一个个大箱子，收拾里面的东西。”艾米丽亚小姐说，“我从来没有见过那些玩意儿——大衣上镶着又是黑貂皮又是白貂皮，内衣上的花边是地道的法国瓦朗西安货。你看过她的一些衣服，你觉得怎么样？”

“我觉得这些玩意儿荒唐透顶，”明卿小姐尖声答道，“不过礼拜天我们领学生去教堂的时候，让她穿着这样的衣服排在队伍前头，就显得有气派了。给她置办这样的行头，她就像个小公主似的。”

再说楼上锁起来的房间里，萨拉和爱米丽坐在地上，眼睛瞪着出租马车消失在拐角处，那时候克鲁上尉回过头来，挥着手、飞吻起来，仿佛不忍心停下手来。





二　法语课


第二天早晨萨拉进教室的时候，大家都睁大眼睛，好奇地打量着她。这时候，每一个学生——从快满十三岁、自认已经是大人的拉维尼亚·赫伯特，到只有四岁、全校最小的洛蒂·利——都已经听到过很多有关她的事。她们清楚地知道她是明卿小姐用来装点门面的“示范生”，被看成是学校的荣耀。有一两个学生甚至看过一眼她的法国女仆玛丽埃塔。她是昨天晚上到的。拉维尼亚有意在萨拉的房门开着时走过去，看到玛丽埃塔在打开一只箱子。箱子刚从一艘晚到的船上托运来。

“里面装满了裙子，裙衬上镶着花边——各种各样的褶边，”拉维尼亚一边装着埋头看地理书，一边低声对她的朋友杰西说，“我看到她把它们抖搂出来。我听到明卿小姐对艾米丽亚小姐说，小孩子穿这样花哨的衣服实在太荒唐了。我妈妈也说小孩子应该穿得朴素些。她现在就穿着一件那样的裙子。她坐下来的时候我看到了。”

“她还穿着丝袜哩！”杰西低声说，同样低头装着在看地理书，“瞧她那双腿真叫娇小！我从来没有看到那么娇小的腿。”

“哼，”拉维尼亚不怀好意地哼着鼻子，“那是因为她的鞋子做得小巧。我妈妈说只要找到一个手巧的鞋匠，就是大脚都能显得娇小。我认为她一点也不漂亮。瞧她眼珠子的颜色多怪。”

“她不像其他漂亮的人那么漂亮，”杰西说着，偷偷朝教室的另一端看了一眼，“可是她让你看了想再看她一眼。她的眼睫毛特别长，可是她的眼珠子几乎是绿色的。”

萨拉安静地坐在座位上，等着听人家吩咐自己该做什么。她被安排在明卿小姐的桌子附近。在那么多双眼睛的注视下，她丝毫没有感到局促不安。她反而觉得挺有趣，便不动声色地回头盯着那些打量自己的孩子们。她想知道，她们在想什么，她们是不是喜欢明卿小姐，喜不喜欢功课，她们当中有没有哪个和她一样，有个好爸爸。那天早晨她对爱米丽说了很多有关她爸爸的事。

“这会儿他在海上啦，爱米丽，”她说，“咱俩必须成为好朋友，心里有事谁也不瞒着谁。爱米丽，看着我。你有一双我见过最漂亮的眼睛——要是你能开口说说话儿那该多好。”

她是个充满想象力的孩子，满脑子的奇思怪想。其中之一便是：要是爱米丽有生命、真的能听见、能明白她的话——哪怕她明知道是不可能的——对她也是一大安慰。玛丽埃塔帮她穿上深蓝色的校服，用一根深蓝缎带扎好头发以后，她便去找爱米丽。爱米丽坐在一把它专用的椅子上，萨拉递给它一本书。

“我在楼下的时候你可以看看书。”她说。看到玛丽埃塔在好奇地看着她，小脸上现出严肃神情，对玛丽埃塔说。

“说到洋娃娃，我相信，”她说，“有些事她们是能够做到的，只是不想让我们知道。真的，说不定爱米丽能够读书、说话、走路，不过只有在房间里没人的时候她才这么做。那是她的秘密。你瞧，要是人们知道洋娃娃能够做这些事情，他们就会逼她们干活了。所以，说不定她们相互约定要保密。如果你留在房间里，爱米丽只会瞪着眼睛坐在那里，要是你一出去，她会开始读书，说不定还会走过去往窗外看哩。到时候要是她听到你我来了，她就会跑回去，跳上自己的椅子，假装她一直待在那儿。”

“听她说得多逗！”玛丽埃塔自言自语用法语道。等她到了楼下便把这事告诉领班女仆。她已经喜欢上了这个古怪的小女孩子了。你看她有那么一张聪慧的小脸，举止彬彬有礼。她以前照料过的孩子没一个像萨拉这样有礼貌的。萨拉是一个明事理的小姑娘，说起话来柔声柔气，用带着尊重人的口吻跟人说“劳驾了，玛丽埃塔”“谢谢，玛丽埃塔”，让人听了心里甜甜的。玛丽埃塔告诉领班女仆，萨拉谢她的时候就像是在谢一位高贵的女士。

“这小姑娘，简直是位公主。”她说的是法语。确实，她非常喜欢自己的新小主人，很高兴自己找到这么个新职位。

萨拉来到教室，就座后让同学注视了几分钟，明卿小姐这才威严地敲了敲桌子。

“小姐们，”她说，“我要向你们介绍一位新朋友。”所有的小女孩各自从座位上起立，萨拉也站了起来。“我希望你们都和克鲁小姐融洽相处。她刚刚远道而来——确切地说，从印度来。下课后你们应该相互认识认识。”

学生们郑重地鞠了一躬，萨拉浅浅地回了个屈膝礼，然后大家坐下来，再次相互对望一番。

“萨拉，”明卿小姐拿出老师的腔调，一本正经地说，“来，到我这儿来。”

她从桌子上拿起一本书，翻了翻。萨拉有礼貌地到了她跟前。

“既然你爸爸已经给你请了一位法国女仆，”她说，“我肯定他特别希望你学好法语。”

萨拉听了觉得有点不知所措。

“我想他请了她来，”她说，“是因为他——我爸爸认为我会喜欢她，明卿小姐。”

“我担心，”明卿小姐说话时，脸上挤出一丝冷笑，“你已经是一个被宠坏的小姑娘了，老以为凡事得按你的高兴来安排。我的印象是你爸爸希望你学好法语。”

假如萨拉年纪大一点，或者不是这么一味讲究礼貌，她本可以几句话就把事情说清楚的。可是，情况并非如此，当时她脸孔涨得通红。明卿小姐对人相当严厉，又非常专横，她认准萨拉对法语一窍不通，觉得要是哪个想要纠正自己的看法几乎是件不礼貌的行为。事实上，萨拉早就懂法语了。她还是婴儿的时候，父亲就常常对她讲法语。她母亲是法国人，克鲁上尉一直喜欢法语，所以巧的是萨拉听着法语长大的，非常熟悉法语。

“我——我从来没有正规地学过法语，但是——但是——”萨拉羞涩地开口说了起来，实指望把自己的想法清楚地表达出来。

明卿小姐有个大秘密，令她烦恼的是她自己不会说法语，又急于要掩盖这个恼人的事实。因此，她不准备讨论这件事，免得让一个新来的小学生天真的提问让自己露了底。

“行了，不必说了，”她用一种既有分寸又尖酸的口吻说，“如果你没有学过，那就必须立即学起来。法语老师杜法奇先生，他过几分钟就到了。把这本书拿去，在他上课前你先看看。”

萨拉只觉得两腮发烫。她回到座位上打开书，一本正经地看着第一页。她知道这时候要是露出笑容来是不得体的，她下定决心不让自己显得不懂礼貌。可是令她感到非常古怪的是，要学的这页书上尽是说“le père”的意思是“父亲”、“la mère”是“母亲”一类的内容。

明卿小姐仔细地瞟了她一眼。

“看来你还挺不高兴哩，萨拉，”她说，“你居然不喜欢学习法语，我感到很遗憾。”

“我很喜欢法语，”萨拉回答，想再解释解释，“可是——”

“要你去做事情的时候，你绝对不准说‘可是’，”明卿小姐说，“接着看你的书。”

萨拉照着做了，而且没有笑出来，甚至当她发现“le fils”是“儿子”、“le frère”是“兄弟”的时候，她也没有露出笑容。

“等杜法奇先生来了，”她想，“我会让他明白的。”

杜法奇先生很快就来了。他是一个很和善、聪明的中年法国人，当他的目光落到萨拉身上，见她出于礼貌，正装得专心致志地读那本印着法语词汇的小册子，引起了他的关注。

“这是我的新学生吗，小姐？”他问明卿小姐，“但愿我有这样的荣幸。”

“她的爸爸——克鲁上尉——殷切地希望她开始学这门语言。但是我担心她对法语有点幼稚的偏见。她似乎不愿意学。”明卿小姐说。

“很遗憾，小姐。”他和颜悦色地对萨拉说，“也许，等我们一起学了以后，我也许能够证明给你看，那是一种迷人的语言。”

小萨拉从座位上站起来。她渐渐感到绝望，仿佛自己在丢脸。她抬头望着杜法奇先生的脸，那双大大的灰绿色眼睛露出纯真祈求的神情。她知道，只要她开口说话，他就会明白真相的。于是她开始用相当漂亮而流利的法语简单地解释起来。明卿女士自然听不明白她说了些什么。萨拉说她没有正正规规学过法语——没有从书本上学——可是她爸爸和其他人一直对她讲法语，她能用法语读和写，就像用英语读写一样。她爸爸喜爱法语，所以她也跟着喜爱上法语。她亲爱的妈妈，在她出生时去世了，她是法国人。她乐于学习先生教的任何东西。她刚才试着对这位女士解释，她已经知道这本书里的词了——说到这里，她递过去那本小小的词汇书。

一听她讲起法语来，明卿小姐猛地一惊，坐在那里，从眼镜框上面瞪着她，几乎气愤不过，总算听她说完。杜法奇先生开始露出笑容来，感到一种真心的喜悦。听到这个漂亮的孩子气的声音讲着自己的母语，说得如此简洁、如此动听，让他觉得似乎回到了故乡——在伦敦阴暗多雾的日子里，他与故乡如隔九重天。等她说完，他充满柔情地把词汇书从她手里接过去。他只对明卿小姐说。

“啊，小姐，”他说，“我没什么可教她的。她没有学过法语，但她简直就是个法国人。她说一口标准的法国话。”

“你应该早些告诉我！”明卿小姐感到蒙受了极大的屈辱，转向萨拉，大声说道。

“我——我试过，”萨拉说，“我——想来我一开始没把话说清楚。”

明卿小姐心里明白，她是试过，只是没有机会让她解释，这不是她的错。但是她看到学生们一直在听，拉维尼亚和杰西把脸藏在法语语法书后面发出咯咯笑声，顿时火冒三丈。

“肃静，小姐们！”她厉声道，敲着课桌，“都给我安静下来！”

从此之后，她便对自己的“示范生”怀恨在心了。





三　埃芒加德


就在萨拉来后的第一天上午，萨拉在明卿小姐身旁坐下，意识到全班同学都在全神贯注地打量自己，很快她就注意到一个小女孩，年纪和她差不多，一双浅淡而无神的蓝眼睛使劲地打量着她。这小姑娘长得胖乎乎的，看上去一点也不机灵，可是一张小嘴撅了起来，显得煞是敦厚。她那亚麻色的头发编成一条结实的辫子，上面扎着一条缎带，她把辫子从背后绕过脖子拉到身前，嘴巴咬着缎带的末梢，双肘支在课桌上，双眼好奇地瞪着这个新生。杜法奇先生开始对萨拉讲话的时候，她显得有点慌张，后来萨拉往前走上一步、用纯真、祈求的目光望着杜法奇先生，出其不意地用法语答话时，胖女孩吓了一跳，崇敬和惊讶之余，脸孔变得通红。想自己几个星期来，使劲地去记“la mere”是“母亲”、“le père”是“父亲”，结果还是没能像说英语那样背得滚瓜烂熟，为此流了不少泪水，如今突然听到一个孩子，年龄与自己相仿，不仅相当熟悉这些词语，显然还知道其他许多别的词语，而且仿佛毫不费劲似的，能够用动词和它们搭配起来，叫她好不难受。她的目光使劲地盯着，紧紧狠咬辫子上的缎带末梢，这情景引起明卿小姐的注意。殊不知明卿小姐这时正在气头上，禁不住向她猛冲过去。

“圣·约翰小姐！”她厉声怒斥道，“你这举动是什么意思？把胳膊放下！把缎带从嘴里拿出来！给我坐直了！”

这一通呵斥，又吓了圣·约翰小姐一跳，又听得拉维尼亚和杰西跟着偷偷地“嗤嗤”笑了起来，害得她的脸涨得更红了——通红通红，真的，眼看着她可怜、无神、稚气的眼睛这就要涌出滚滚泪水了。这情景萨拉看在眼里，为她感到难过，于是便喜欢上了她，想和她做个朋友。萨拉就是这样的人，见到谁受委屈、遇到麻烦、被人欺侮，都忍不住要挺身而出。

“假如萨拉是个男孩子，早出生几个世纪，”想当初她父亲经常说，“她一定会利剑出鞘，四方行侠，路见不平，拔刀相助。”

于是她喜爱上了胖乎乎、傻里傻气的小圣·约翰小姐，整个上午目光不时地瞟上她一眼。看得出来，对方学习起来并不轻松，永远也不会落到被当成“示范生”而被宠坏的危险境地。她学起法语来算是糟透了。听了她的发音，杜法奇先生忍不住笑出声来，而拉维尼亚、杰西和其他比她幸运的女孩子们不是发出咯咯笑声，就是用惊异、轻蔑的目光打量她。但是萨拉没有笑。圣·约翰小姐把“le bon pain”念成“lee bong pang”的时候，她硬是装作没有听到。她生性善良，有副火热的心肠。当她听到人家不怀好意的“嗤嗤”笑声，又看到圣·约翰那张可怜、迟钝、痛苦的小脸时，气极了。

“有什么好笑的？”她咬着牙，低头对着书，说，“她们不应该笑。”

下课后，学生们三五成群，一起聊天，萨拉找到圣·约翰小姐，发现她无精打采地蜷缩着，坐在窗台上，便走过去与她说话。萨拉只不过说了些小姑娘之间刚开始认识时常说的那一类话，可是总能给人一种亲切、友好的感觉。

“你叫什么名字？”她问。

圣·约翰小姐这时候自然显得很惊讶，要问为什么，我们必须记住这么一个事实：作为新来的学生，短时间内往往是不可能被人了解的；而这一个新生更特别，头天夜里她成了整个学校议论的对象。她身上有那么多引人激动而自相矛盾的故事，不由得大家说呀说，说到实在没劲了才睡去。一个新生，有自己的马车、自己的小马驹，还有一个女仆，并且漂洋过海来自印度，结识这样的人可不是一件寻常的事。

“我叫埃芒加德·圣·约翰。”她回答。

“我叫萨拉·克鲁。”萨拉说，“你的名字很好听。听起来像是故事书里的。”

“你喜欢吗？”埃芒加德结巴地说，“我——我挺喜欢你的名字。”

圣·约翰小姐生活里的一大麻烦就是她有个聪明过人的父亲。有时候在她的眼里这竟是一个致命的灾难。如果你有一个无所不知的父亲，他会说七八种外国话，他有的是万卷书，都能熟记在心，他自然指望你至少做到熟悉自己课本里的内容；也可能要求你该记住一些历史事件，会做法语练习。埃芒加德却成了圣·约翰先生手上烫手的山芋。他怎么也不明白：为什么自己的孩子无可置疑竟会是这么一个地地道道的傻东西，没丁点灵性。

“老天爷！”他曾经不止一次瞪着女儿说，“有时候我觉得她和她伊莱扎姨妈一样蠢！”

如果说她的姨母伊莱扎学起东西来向来很迟钝，学会了很快又会忘得精光，埃芒加德也跟她一个样。不可否认，她是全校出了名的十足的笨蛋。

“得逼着她学进去。”她父亲对明卿小姐说。

结果害得埃芒加德在羞辱和泪水中挨过自己大部分的日子。她学了，又忘了；要不然，即使记住了，并不理解。所以和萨拉认识之后，她自然会坐着不胜仰慕地盯着她看。

“你会说法语，是不是？”她钦佩地问。

萨拉也坐到窗台上去。窗台大而深，她蜷起双脚，双手抱着膝盖。

“我会说是因为我一出生就听着法语。”她回答，“要是你一直听着的话也会说。”

“噢，不，我不行。”埃芒加德说，“我永远也学不会！”

“为什么？”萨拉好奇地问。

埃芒加德使劲摇着头，辫子跟着左右摇晃起来。

“刚才你不是听到了吗，”她说，“我总是那样。老念不准那些词儿。听起来古里古怪的。”

她停顿了一下，然后补了一句，口气带着几分敬畏：

“你很聪明，是不是？”

萨拉看着窗外昏暗的广场，只见麻雀在湿漉漉的铁栏杆和污黑的树枝上跳着、叫着。她沉思了一阵。她经常听到人说她“聪明”，她想知道自己是不是聪明——假如她真的聪明，那又是怎么聪明起来的？

“我说不准，”她说，“也说不明白。”这时她看到那张胖嘟嘟的圆脸上露出沮丧的神情，便微微笑了笑，换了个话题。

“你想去见爱米丽吗？”她问。

“爱米丽是谁？”埃芒加德问，明卿小姐当时也是这样问的。

“到我房间看看去。”萨拉说罢伸出手来。

两个人双双从窗台上跳下来，上楼去了。

“真的吗，”两个人穿过大厅，埃芒加德低声问，“你真的有一间专用的游戏室？”

“真的，”萨拉答道，“爸爸让明卿小姐给我安排了一间，因为——嗯，因为我玩游戏的时候会编故事给自己听，我不喜欢让别人听到。要是知道有人在听，我就编不下去了。”

说话间她们已经到了通向萨拉房间的走廊，埃芒加德猛地停下脚步，睁大眼睛，屏住了呼吸。

“你会编故事！”她喘着粗气，说，“你能说法语——还会编故事，是吗？”

萨拉好奇地看着她。

“不是吗，人人都能编故事，”她说，“你压根就没编过？”

她把手按在埃芒加德的手上，提醒她。

“我们得悄悄地来到门口，”她低声说，“然后我会很突然地把门打开。也许能够抓她个正着。”

虽说，埃芒加德一点也不明白对方这话是什么意思，想“抓到”的是哪个，为什么想抓到她，但见萨拉脸上露出浅浅笑意，眼里透出一丝神秘的期待，引起埃芒加德莫大的兴趣，不论萨拉葫芦里卖的什么药，埃芒加德都确信那肯定是件令人开心的好事儿。于是，埃芒加德满怀着激动和兴奋，踮起脚尖跟着她穿过走廊。一路上两个人悄没声息地径直来到门口。萨拉突然扭开门把手，“嘭”的一声推开了门。门开了，面前是个整洁安静的房间，壁炉里的炉火在温柔地烧着，一个非常漂亮的洋娃娃坐在炉火旁的椅子上，显然正在看一本书。

“唉，没等我们看见，她就回到座位上去了！”萨拉大声道，“当然了，她们老这样，动作快得像闪电。”

埃芒加德看了看洋娃娃，又看了看萨拉，然后又看了看洋娃娃。

“她能——走路？”她屏住呼吸，问。

“没错，”萨拉答道，“至少我相信她能。至少我装作相信她能。这样就可以认为真的有这回事了。你有没有试过假装什么事？”

“没有，”埃芒加德说，“从来没有。我——给我讲讲怎么回事。”

她被这个古怪的新伙伴深深地迷住了，虽然爱米丽是她见过的最迷人的洋娃娃，可她还是盯着萨拉，而没有去注意爱米丽。

“都坐下来吧，”萨拉说，“我这就告诉你。这事可简单了。只要你开了头，就停不下来。你只管编呀，编呀，一个劲编下去。那感觉妙极了。爱米丽，你给我听着。这位是埃芒加德·圣·约翰，爱米丽。埃芒加德，这位是爱米丽。你想不想抱抱她？”

“噢，我可以吗？”埃芒加德问，“我可以吗，真的？她真漂亮！”接着爱米丽被放到她怀里。

圣·约翰小姐和这个古怪的新生一起度过了一小时，最后午饭铃响起，她们不得不下楼去。在圣·约翰小姐过去那乏味而短暂的生命里，她从未梦想过自己会有这样美好的时光。

萨拉坐在炉前的小地毯上，给她讲了各种各样奇异的经历。她蜷缩着坐在那里，那绿色的眼睛闪闪发亮，脸颊泛红。她讲自己漂洋过海的经历，讲印度的故事，然而最让埃芒加德着迷的是她对洋娃娃的奇思妙想：说洋娃娃会走路，会说话，人不在房间里的时候她们爱干什么就干什么，但她们必须对自己的法力保密，所以人回到房间的时候她们会“闪电”般冲回原来待的地方。

“我们就做不到，”萨拉一本正经地说，“不是吗，那可是魔法。”

当她说到自己找寻爱米丽的经历时，埃芒加德看到她的表情突然变了。仿佛一朵乌云掠过她的脸，她那晶莹澄澈的眼睛顿时失去了光彩。她急促地吸了口气，跟着发出了一种古怪而凄凉的细声，然后她闭上双唇，紧紧地抿着，似乎她下定了决心要做或者不做什么事。埃芒加德心想，如果萨拉也和别的小女孩一样，到了这个份上，可能会突然放声哭喊起来。然而萨拉没有。

“你——是不是哪里难受？”埃芒加德鼓起勇气问。

“是，”萨拉沉默了一会，答道，“但不是肉体上。”然后她尽量用平静的口气，补充了一句，“在这世上，你最爱的是你爸爸，爱他胜过一切？”

埃芒加德的嘴唇略略闭了起来，不知从何说起。她知道，她原本可以爱自己的父亲，可她做不到。为了避开父亲，让自己单独相处哪怕十分钟，她可以不惜一切代价。但是作为一个优等女校的体面学生，这种事绝对说不出口。此时她觉得左右为难，难堪极了。

“我——我连见到他一面都很少，”她结结巴巴地说，“他总待在书房里——读这、读那。”

“我爱我的爸爸，十倍于世上的一切，”萨拉说，“这就是我难受的地方。他走了。”

她把头静静地垂到拱起来的小膝盖上，一动不动地坐了几分钟。

“看她这就要放声大哭了。”埃芒加德不由得担心起来。

然而，她没有哭。她短短的黑色卷发垂在耳际，她一动不动地端坐着。后来她头也不抬，开了口。

“我对他发誓说：我会忍耐下去的。”她说，“我会的。有些事情非得忍耐。想想那些当兵的怎么忍耐吧！爸爸是个军人。要是打仗的话，他就要忍受行军和饥渴。还有，说不定，受重伤。可他不会抱怨——半句怨言也不会说——半句都不会说。”

埃芒加德还能说什么呢，她只有盯着她看的份儿，她感到自己开始崇拜上对方了。她多了不起，简直与众不同。

这时候，萨拉抬起脸，漾出一丝古怪的笑意。她把黑发卷甩到脑后。

“假如让我不停嘴，一直讲呀讲，”她说，“把假装的各种事情都讲给你听，一些事我就能容易忍受下去。忘是忘不了的，可是你能容易忍受一些。”

埃芒加德的喉头好像有些哽咽，眼睛里噙着泪水。

“都说拉维尼亚和杰西是‘最要好的朋友’，”她嗓音沙哑地说，“但愿我们也能做‘最要好的朋友’。你愿意让我做你最要好的朋友吗？你聪明，可我是全校最蠢的孩子，可我——噢，我真的喜欢你！”

“我很乐意，”萨拉说，“有人喜欢自己，那才高兴哩。是的，我们会成为朋友的。听我说——”她的脸上突然闪出异彩，“——我可以帮你学好法语。”





四　洛蒂


假如萨拉是另一种类型的孩子，那么，以后的四年中，她在明卿小姐的这所优等女校里的生活，是不会有什么好处的。因为她在这里是被当成尊贵的客人供养着，而不只是被当成一个普通的小女孩；假如她是自以为是、固执而又盛气凌人的孩子的话，在这样一个处处受人娇宠奉承的环境下，恐怕早就变得让人无法容忍、非常讨人嫌了；假如她是个生性懒惰的小姑娘，那更加什么都学不到了。明卿小姐骨子里很恨她，但她精通人情世故，表面上绝对不会做出什么事情来让这样一位求之不得的学生离开女校的。她很明白，只要萨拉写一封信，告诉克鲁上尉，说她在这里过得不快乐、不舒心，那克鲁上尉马上就会让她转学。明卿小姐认为，只要不断夸奖一个孩子，让她随心所欲，这孩子肯定会喜欢上这个养尊处优的地方。所以，萨拉经常得到夸奖，说她聪明好学，举止优雅，对同学亲切友好；哪怕她从钱包里掏出小小的六便士钱施舍给乞丐，就会被说成大方慷慨，马上受到表扬；哪怕是做了最微不足道的小事，也会被明卿小姐当成一件美德来夸奖。要不是她有着温和的性格，那个小脑袋足够聪明的话，早就变成一个洋洋自得的小女孩了。但她总能用自己聪明的头脑来判断一切，并了解自己的真实情况。在今后的日子里，她时不时把自己的想法告诉埃芒加德。

“人们碰到的很多事儿其实都是机缘凑巧。”萨拉说，“我就碰巧遇上了很多好事。碰巧我喜欢上看书和学习，碰巧我学了就记得住；我碰巧一生下来就有个相貌堂堂、和善又聪明的好爸爸，能给我喜欢的一切东西。其实我的脾气可能根本就不好，但是，你已经什么都有了，别人对你又那么好，那你不就自然而然地变成了一个好脾气的孩子了吗？我不知道——”这时的萨拉看上去很严肃，“我甚至不知道自己到底是个好孩子，还是个讨人厌的孩子，或者干脆就是个不怎么样的坏东西，只是没有人知道，因为我没有经过什么考验。”

“拉维尼亚也没有经受过考验，”埃芒加德执拗地说，“可她就很让人讨厌。”

萨拉若有所思地摸着自己的小鼻子尖儿，好像在认真考虑这个问题。

“嗨，”她开口了，“也许——也许是因为她正在发育吧。”

她想起艾米丽亚小姐曾说过，拉维尼亚发育得那么快，她担心这对身体和性格会有不好的影响。所以萨拉才得出这么个宽宏大量的结论。

事实上，拉维尼亚很歹毒，她非常嫉恨萨拉。在萨拉来女校之前，她一直觉得自己是这里的领袖。她之所以能统领别人，是因为要是别的孩子不听她的意旨，她就让对方过不下去。她欺负比她小的孩子，而在那些跟她差不多或者比她大的孩子面前，她也要摆出高高在上的架势。她很漂亮，如果女校的孩子们排成两人一排的队伍外出的话，数她穿得最讲究。可是萨拉出现了，穿着天鹅绒的外套，戴着黑色的貂皮暖手筒，还插着低垂的鸵鸟毛，在明卿小姐的带领下，走在队伍最前面。一开始，这事儿就让拉维尼亚够难受的。后来时间长了，情势越来越清楚，萨拉显然成了孩子们的领袖人物，这倒不是因为她会欺负人，恰恰相反，因为她从来不这样做。

“可是萨拉·克鲁有个特点，”杰西说了句老实话，惹恼了她“最要好的朋友”，“她从来都不‘摆大佬的谱子’，虽然她完全有这个能耐，拉维，要是我也有那么多好东西，还经常被人夸奖，我肯定忍不住会摆起谱来的。不过，当家长们来的时候，明卿小姐简直把萨拉捧上了天，那样子真叫人恶心。”

“‘亲爱的萨拉，你可得去客厅，跟马思格雷太太谈谈印度的事儿’，”拉维尼亚惟妙惟肖地学着明卿小姐的腔调，“‘亲爱的萨拉，你可一定得跟皮忒金夫人说几句法语，你的发音可真棒’。哼，她的法语又不是在这里学的。她懂法语也不见得是因为有多聪明。她自己就是这么说的，她其实没学过什么法语，只不过是碰巧捡到的，因为老听她爸爸说。而她爸爸，一个留在印度的军官，也没什么大不了的。”

“可是，”杰西慢悠悠地说，“他打死过老虎。萨拉房间里的那张虎皮就是他爸打死的。所以她才会那么喜欢它，躺在上面，抚摩虎皮的脑袋，还跟它说话，仿佛那只是只小猫儿。”

“她总爱干些傻里傻气的蠢事，”拉维尼亚没好气地说，“我妈妈说过，她老拿假事当真事的做法太蠢了，长大后准会变成个古怪的姑娘。”

确实如此，萨拉从来不摆谱子。她是个和善的小丫头，总是把属于自己的特权和好东西慷慨地和别人分享。那些十到十二岁的女孩经常呵斥年龄小的孩子，嫌她们碍事，但最令她们羡慕的萨拉却从来没有惹她们哭过鼻子。她有一副慈母心肠，见到有人摔跤、擦破膝盖，她就会跑过去把她们扶起，拍拍她们，甚至从兜里翻出夹心糖什么的哄她们开心。她从来不把年龄小的孩子推开，给自己让路，也不会因为人家年龄小而欺负她们，嫌她们什么都不懂。

“人家是四岁，这不假，”有一次，她严厉地冲着拉维尼亚说，因为拉维尼亚打了洛蒂一巴掌，骂她是“小屁孩”——那是赖不掉的，“可是到了明年不就是五岁，后年不就是六岁了吗？再说——”她瞪大眼睛，露出谴责的神情，“再过上十六年，那她就二十岁了！”

“老天爷！”拉维尼亚说，“你倒真算得远哩！”可不是，十六加四不就是二十吗？这是明摆着的事——但二十岁这么大的年龄，连最大胆的孩子也不敢去想象的。

所以，那些小家伙们几乎都崇拜萨拉。大家都知道，她可不止一回在自己的房间里举办过茶会，让那些被人瞧不起的孩子一起参加，爱米丽也和她们一起玩，而且用上爱米丽专用的茶具——其中几只杯子上有天蓝色的花纹，盛的是加了很多糖的淡茶。孩子们谁都没见过这么逼真的洋娃娃专用茶杯。从那以后，初级班的孩子们简直把萨拉当成是女神或者女皇了。

洛蒂·利非常崇拜萨拉，如果萨拉不是个有慈母心肠的人，她肯定会讨厌死洛蒂的。洛蒂的爸爸是个没有什么责任心的年轻人。他觉得除了把洛蒂送到这里来读书，便没有别的办法了。洛蒂的妈妈很早就去世了，所以这小家伙一出生就一直被当成是宝贝洋娃娃、小猴子或者是小狗那样被人惯着、宠着，结果成了个爱哭爱闹、人见人怕的小冤家。要是她想要什么东西，要么不想要什么东西，便给你来个大哭大闹一场；更要命的是，她要的东西就是那些根本不可能给她的东西，而那些对她有用的东西，却偏偏不要。于是，你会经常在那幢房子这头或那头听到那由低而高、尖细、刺耳的号哭声。

洛蒂以不可思议的方式掌握了一种绝招：她发现一个失去母亲的孩子理应博得人们的怜悯和娇惯。这可能是在她妈妈去世后她从大人的一些谈论中领悟到的，所以，使起这绝招来很是得心应手。

萨拉对洛蒂的照顾开始于某天早晨，当时她正从孩子起居室前经过，听到明卿和艾米丽亚小姐正在想方设法让一个孩子从愤怒的哭闹声中平静下来，可这孩子硬是不肯善罢甘休，反而加大了力气，丝毫不肯就范，气得明卿小姐扯起了嗓门，厉声嚷嚷起来，指望把那孩子的尖细嗓门压下去。

“她倒是干吗哭闹呢？”明卿小姐几乎是在吼叫了。

“呜——呜——呜！”萨拉听到那小女孩哭喊着，“我没有妈——妈呀！”

“唉，洛蒂！”艾米丽亚小姐尖声道，“行了，宝贝儿，你就别闹了，求你别闹了！”

“呜——呜——呜！”洛蒂哭得越发厉害了，“我没有妈——妈呀！”

“她这是欠揍，”明卿小姐说，“你这不听话的家伙，活该挨鞭子！”

洛蒂哭得更凶了，急得艾米丽亚也跟着哭了起来。明卿小姐已是喊声如雷，突然气急败坏地从椅子上跳起来，怒气冲冲奔出房间，扔下艾米丽亚小姐单枪匹马来收拾残局。

萨拉犹豫不决地站在走廊上，拿不准主意该不该进去。她最近刚刚和洛蒂交了朋友，也许能让她安静下来。明卿小姐走出来时正好看到萨拉，显得相当懊恼，因为她知道，自己在房间里的表现有失端庄，怕是太凶了点。

“是你呀，萨拉！”她大声说道，脸上挤出恰如其分的笑意。

“我在这里是因为——”萨拉说，“我知道那是洛蒂——我觉得——也许——也许我可以试一试，让她安静下来，行吗，明卿小姐？”

“没准你能办到。瞧你多能呀。”明卿小姐说到这里，猛地停了嘴，因为她自觉自己说话太粗鲁，扫了萨拉的兴，便改变态度，说，“你方方面面确实都很能干！”她突然又换了一副赞许的口气说，“我觉得你能对付得了她，进去吧！”说完就走了。

萨拉走了进去。洛蒂正躺在地板上尖声哭叫，一对胖乎乎的小腿儿乱踢乱蹬，艾米丽亚小姐绝望得手足无措，蹲在洛蒂身边，满脸通红，汗珠直往下滴。当初洛蒂在自己家里的儿童室里，只需乱踢乱叫一阵，自己要什么，最终总会到手的。可怜的胖艾米丽亚小姐使尽了浑身解数，硬是没有奏效。

她一会儿说：“可怜的乖乖，我知道你没有妈妈，真可怜——”然后又突然改口说：“洛蒂，你要再不停下来，我可不理你了，你这可怜的小天使。得了，别闹了。你这讨人厌的可恶家伙。看我不扇你耳光，我真的要动手了！”

萨拉悄悄走到她们旁边。她并不知道该怎么办。她只有一个模糊的想法，那就是，不要讲别的不中用的话来刺激洛蒂。

“艾米丽亚小姐，”萨拉小声说，“明卿小姐同意让我来试试，让她安静下来，可以吗？”

艾米丽亚小姐转过头，带着一副无奈的神色。“你？你觉得你有办法？”她喘着粗气说。

“我也不知道行不行，”萨拉仍然小声说，“但我想试试。”

艾米丽亚小姐原本跪在地板上，听了她这话便立了起来，身子晃晃悠悠，都快站不稳了。她叹了口气，而小洛蒂还在那里使劲蹬着胖腿儿。

“你最好悄悄离开这里的好，”萨拉说，“让我一个人留在这里陪她吧！”

“哎呀，萨拉！”艾米丽亚小姐几乎快要哭出来了，“我们从未遇到过这么可怕的孩子，我相信，我们没法让她留下来了。”

艾米丽亚小姐还是悄悄地走了，有了这么个借口跑掉，让她大大松了口气。

这小女孩还在一个劲地哭闹、撒泼，萨拉立在一旁，低头看着她，一声不吭，然后干脆一屁股坐在地板上，等着。房间里除了洛蒂的哭叫声，没别的声音。小洛蒂可从未遇到过这种局面。可不是吗，她已经习惯了自己一边哭着，一边听很多人轮番着又是责怪，又是恳求，又是命令和哄骗。而现在，她又哭又闹，身边那仅有的一个人却好像满不在乎，这一新的情况引起了她的注意，她偷偷睁开原本紧闭的泪眼，想看清身边到底是哪个。一看，原来是个小姑娘，就是那个拥有爱米丽和各种新鲜玩意的女孩。对方紧紧地盯着自己，好像自个儿在想心事。洛蒂停了几秒钟，为的是想摸清情况。现在她觉得必须重新开始哭闹了，但房间太安静，萨拉的表情又是那样古怪和关切，害得洛蒂重新哭出来的第一声尖叫有点不太尽兴。

“我没有——妈妈——没有妈妈！”她又哭喊起来，但没有刚才那么有劲了。

萨拉更加平静地看着她，流露出理解的目光。

“我也没有妈妈。”她说。

这话大出意料，洛蒂吃了一惊。她真的放下了蹬着的腿，转动了一下身子，瞪着萨拉。你们看，在一个什么办法都无济于事的情况下，一个小小的奇怪念头就阻止了一个孩子的痛哭。当然，还有一个原因是，洛蒂本来就讨厌明卿小姐，她太凶了；也不喜欢艾米丽亚，她只会笨拙地纵容；可是她很喜欢萨拉，虽然不是很熟。洛蒂可没有打算完全放弃哭诉这一招，可是她的注意力已经被分散了，于是她只好又转过身子，气呼呼地抽搐着，问：

“她哪儿去了？”

萨拉半晌没有回答。别人告诉她说妈妈上天堂去了，这件事她想过很多很多，她的想法跟别的人可不一样。

“她上天堂了，”她说，“但她肯定会经常来看我，只是我看不见她。你妈妈肯定也是这样。说不定，这会儿她俩就在看着咱俩，说不定这会儿她俩就在这屋子里。”

洛蒂笔直地坐了起来，环顾四周。她其实是个长着卷发、挺漂亮的小人儿，圆溜溜的眼睛就像满含露珠的勿忘我花。可要是她妈妈看到她足足闹腾了半个小时的话，恐怕也不会认为她是那种可以被叫做天使的孩子了。

萨拉还在讲着。在别人看来，她讲的这些太像是童话故事，可是在她自己的头脑中，这一切完全是真的，洛蒂情不自禁地跟着听了下去。曾经有人告诉洛蒂，说她妈妈长着一对翅膀，头戴花冠，她自己呢，也曾经见过一些画片，画着一些妇女，个个穿着美丽的白色长袍，都说那就是天使。可现在听萨拉说来，这都是发生在一个可爱的地方的真实故事，那里住着的都是活生生的人。

“成片的田野上处处鲜花盛开，”她说着，照例那么忘我，沉浸在梦幻之中，“田野上盛开着百合花——每当微风吹过，花香在空中飘散——柔美的风儿不停地吹送，人们争相呼吸着花香。孩子们在花的海洋里奔跑，采了一束又一束百合，他们高兴地笑着，编织小小的花环。街道亮光闪闪，即使走得再远，人们也不会感到疲倦。他们可以自由飞翔，想到哪里就去哪里。城墙用珍珠和黄金堆砌而成，城墙矮矮的，人们可以爬上去俯瞰大地，微笑着，传递最美好的祝愿。”

不管萨拉在讲些什么，洛蒂听了准会停止哭闹，听得入迷。谁也不能否认，这个故事比其他的故事更美丽、更动听。洛蒂的身子挨近萨拉，一字一句出神地听着，听完了故事——唉，想不到这么快就讲完了，洛蒂感到非常可惜，她又开始撅起了嘴巴，这可不是一个好兆头。

“我要去那里！”她嚷了起来，“我——我在这学校里连妈妈也没有！”

萨拉一看不妙，马上从梦境中回过神来，握住洛蒂的小胖手，拉到自己身边，微笑着哄她。

“我来当你的妈妈，”她说，“我们一起玩，你就是我的小女儿，爱米丽是你的妹妹。”

洛蒂的脸蛋上顿时露出一对小酒窝。

“她愿意吗？”洛蒂问。

“当然喽，”萨拉说着，跳了起来，“这就去告诉她，我还要帮你洗洗脸，梳梳头。”

洛蒂高高兴兴一口答应下来，跟着萨拉一路小跑出了起居室，上了楼，好像压根不记得刚才闹了整整一个小时的悲剧——那都是因为她不肯梳头洗脸，把明卿小姐给惹了来行使自己尊贵的权威。

从此以后，萨拉便当起洛蒂的“妈妈”了。





五　贝基


当然，萨拉所具有的最大魅力就是她讲起故事来有声有色，不论什么，一经她讲起来，活灵活现，即使不是故事，也全都像故事了。虽然她有的是华丽衣饰，又是女校里的“示范生”，但比较起来，她讲故事的魅力更能赢得更多的追随者；同时又引得拉维尼亚和其他几个小女孩最为忌妒，可也最能使她们不由自主地为之倾倒。

但凡与善讲故事者同过校的人都知道，那是一种什么样神奇的魅力——那个故事大王随时都有一大帮男女生围着他转，低声恳求他给自己讲个传奇故事；成群成堆的人围成一圈，那些被挤在外围的人自然有点被冷落的感觉，硬是想挤进去，实指望靠得更近些，听得更清楚些。萨拉不仅会讲故事，而且非常喜欢讲故事。当她坐在或站在人群围成的小圈子中间开始编造精彩的情节时，一双绿眼睛变得又大又亮，双颊绯红；她会不知不觉地表演起来，抑扬顿挫的语调、俯仰摇摆的苗条身躯和戏剧性的手势，使她所讲的故事既妙趣横生又惊险恐怖。她忘了自己是在给听得入神的孩子们讲故事；她以为自己就是亲眼见到惊险故事中的童话人物，那些国王、王后和美丽的贵妇人，以及他们的种种历险，并且同他们生活在一起。有时候，她讲完了故事，兴奋得喘不过气来，会把手放在她那瘦小的急促起伏着的胸脯上，半笑着像在自嘲似的。

“我讲的故事，”萨拉会这样说，“那不像是编造出来的。它似乎比你本人更真实——比这间教室还真实。我觉得自己就是故事里的各种人物——先是这个，后来又是另一个。你说怪不怪？”

萨拉在明卿小姐的学校里待了大约两年了。冬天的一个下午，雾气沉沉，她从马车里下来，舒适地裹着她最暖和的天鹅绒和毛皮衣服，想不到自己看上去会这样的雍容华贵。她跨过人行道时，忽然瞥见地下室前台阶上站着一个邋遢的小家伙，正睁大眼睛，伸长脖子，想透过栏杆看她几眼。那污迹斑斑的小脸上的神情既热切又畏怯，引得萨拉不禁看了对方一眼。这时的萨拉面带微笑，因为她对人一向是面带微笑的。

可是那个脸上污迹斑斑和睁大眼睛的小家伙，显然害怕起来了，怕自己被人发现在窥视有身份的学生。她急忙转身躲进了厨房，像玩具匣子里的玩偶，一下子消失得不见影儿，若不是她显得这样的孤苦伶仃，萨拉准会情不自禁地笑起来的。当天傍晚，萨拉坐在教室一角的一群听众中间讲故事，这小家伙怯生生地走进房间，拎着一桶对她来说实在太沉重的煤，在壁炉前的小地毯上跪下，给炉火添煤，清除炉灰。

这时候她比在地下室栏杆后面偷看时干净些了，但看上去还是那么惊惶不安。她显然不敢正眼看这些孩子，也不敢显出在听的样子。她小心翼翼地用手指一块一块地添煤，以免发出响声干扰人，清理火炉用具时也轻手轻脚。不到两分钟，萨拉就看出她对自己讲的故事很感兴趣，正慢慢地干着活，希望听进只言片语。萨拉看出对方的心思后，便提高了嗓音，吐字更清楚了。

“那些美人鱼轻柔地在晶莹碧绿的海水中游弋，身后拖曳着一张用深海珍珠编成的渔网，”她讲着，“公主坐在白色的礁石上望着她们。”

这是个奇妙的故事，说的是一位公主被人鱼王子爱上了，跟着他生活在光华四射的海底洞府里。

壁炉前的小苦工将炉边的地面清扫了一次又一次。扫过了两次，再扫第三次。这故事说得实在诱人，她听得入神，像是被施了魔咒，忘记自己的身份根本无权听故事，也忘记了其他的一切。她原本跪在壁炉前的小地毯上，后来索性坐在脚后跟上，手指漫不经心地夹着壁炉刷。讲故事的人讲着讲着，也把她带进了迂回曲折的海底洞府。洞府里面闪耀着柔和晶莹的蓝光，地上铺的是纯净的金沙。海底的奇花异草在她周围摇曳，远处隐隐约约地回响着歌声与音乐声。

炉刷从那只因劳动而变粗糙的手中掉下来，听到这声音，拉维尼亚·赫伯特回过头来。

“那丫头一直也在听。”她说。

小罪人急忙抓住刷子爬了起来，端着煤箱，像一只受惊的兔子，径直逃出了房间。

萨拉很是气愤。

“我知道她在听，”她说，“她干吗不该听？”

拉维尼亚用十分优雅的姿态扬起头来。

“是啊，”她说，“我不知道你妈妈是否喜欢你给丫头们讲故事，但是我知道我的妈妈不愿我这么做的。”

“我的妈妈！”萨拉说，表情有些怪异，“我相信她一点儿也不在乎。她知道听故事人人都有份。”

“我记得，”拉维尼亚认真地苦想了一阵儿后，反驳道，“你妈妈早死了。她怎么能知道？”

“你认为她就不知道吗？”萨拉用尖细嗓音严厉地说。有时候她的细嗓音是相当严厉的。

“萨拉的妈妈样样事都知道，”洛蒂大声插言道，“我妈妈也知道——萨拉可是我在明卿小姐这儿的妈妈——我的另一个妈妈也样样事都知道。萨拉带我上床睡觉时给我讲过，那里的街道是亮闪闪的，一片片田野上尽是百合花，大家都采花儿。”

“你这个坏东西，”拉维尼亚说罢，转身对萨拉说，“竟敢编造有关天堂里的神话。”

“《启示录》中还有好多精彩的故事哪，”萨拉回敬道，“你自己看看去！你怎么知道是我编出来的？我可要告诉你，”这时候萨拉不免也像凡人，发起小脾气来了，“你如果从此不能对别人友好一些，那你就永远弄不清哪些故事是编造的神话，哪些不是。咱们走，洛蒂。”她大踏步走出教室，很希望能在什么地方再看到那个小女仆，但是当她走进大厅，却不见那女仆的踪影。

“那个生炉子的小女孩是谁？”那天夜里她问玛丽埃塔。

玛丽埃塔讲开了头就说个没完。

啊，不错，萨拉小姐是该问问。她是个孤苦伶仃的小丫头，刚刚接替厨房洗碗女仆的位置——然而虽然是个洗碗工，可样样活儿都得干。她擦皮靴，清扫壁炉，楼上楼下搬运沉甸甸的煤桶，擦地板，擦窗户，人人都对她吆来喝去的。她都十四岁了，但发育不良，看上去连十二岁都不到。说真的，玛丽埃塔也觉得她可怜。她胆小，遇到有人跟她说话，她那双可怜、受惊的眼睛好像就要从眼眶里蹦出来似的。

“她叫什么名字？”萨拉问道，她已在桌旁坐下来，双手支着下巴儿，正入神地听玛丽埃塔讲述。

她的名字叫贝基。玛丽埃塔听到楼下人人都在吆喝“贝基，干这个”“贝基，干那个”，一天到晚不出五分钟准有人要使唤她。

玛丽埃塔走后，萨拉坐在那里望着炉火，想了—会儿贝基的事。她编了个故事，贝基是故事中的女主人公，处处受人虐待。萨拉以为，贝基看上去像是从来没有吃饱过。她的眼神流露出饥饿的神色。萨拉希望能再见到她，可是虽然有几次瞥见她搬东西上下楼，她总显得那样匆忙，生怕被人看见，实在没法跟她说上话。

但是几个星期后，又是一个多雾的下午，萨拉进入起居室时，面前出现一幅哀婉动人的场面。在明亮的炉火前，贝基坐在萨拉专用的心爱安乐椅里，睡得很熟，鼻子上有一处煤灰，围裙上也有几处，那顶破旧的小帽子歪歪斜斜搭在头上，身旁地板上有只空煤箱——她实在累极了，她那吃惯苦的稚嫩小身躯再也支撑不下去了。她刚才被打发上楼，为学生晚上就寝整理各个卧室。房间很多，一整天她跑来跑去。她把萨拉的房间留到最后。萨拉的两个房间跟别的房间不一样。人家的房间都很普通，陈设简单。一般学生有了最起码的生活必需品就够了。可在这个厨房女仆看来，萨拉舒适的起居室简直就是豪华的闺房了，其实只不过是一间精巧明亮的小房间。室内有些图画和书籍，有从印度带来的稀奇古怪的玩意儿，还有一张沙发和一把又软又低的椅子。爱米丽坐在她专用的椅子上，神气活现，像大权在握的女神，而壁炉总擦得精光锃亮，炉火总烧得很旺，下午干的活儿中，贝基把这间房留到最后来收拾，因为进去了可以歇息一会儿。她希望能抓住几分钟在软椅子上坐一坐，四周看看，心想：这孩子好幸运，有那么多漂漂亮亮的奇妙东西，冷天外出时戴着美丽的帽子，穿着外套，叫人羡慕，禁不住透过地下室前的栏杆看上一眼。

这天下午，贝基一坐下，两条原本酸痛的小腿儿顿时得到放松，一种美妙、舒心的感觉，似乎使全身都松弛下来，炉火散发出来的温暖与舒适的光芒像魔法一样在她全身舒展开来，她看着那红红的煤块，一丝疲惫的笑意悄悄漾上她那污渍斑斑的脸上，她的头不知不觉地垂下，眼皮也耷拉下来，她入睡了。实际上她只比萨拉早来十分钟左右，但她已睡得十分熟，仿佛成了已沉睡了百年的睡美人。然而她——可怜的贝基！——模样压根不像睡美人。她只是个形容丑陋、发育不良、筋疲力尽的厨房小苦工。

萨拉与她真有天壤之别，萨拉像是来自另一世界的人物。

就在这个不寻常的下午，萨拉上了舞蹈课。虽说每星期都有舞蹈课，但每当舞蹈教师来的那个下午，始终成了学校的盛大节日。到时候学生们穿上最漂亮的连衣裙，由于萨拉的舞跳得特别好，总让她站在前头，并且事先让玛丽埃塔尽可能地把她打扮得又轻盈又漂亮。

今天，萨拉穿的是玫瑰色的连衣裙，而玛丽埃塔买了一些含苞待放的鲜花，给她编了顶花冠，戴在她的黑卷发上。她刚在学习一种新的、欢快的舞步，跳起来就像一只玫瑰色的大蝴蝶，在教室里翩翩飞舞。她又是排练，又是兴奋，显得喜笑颜开，光彩照人。

她像只蝴蝶，踩着轻快的舞步进了房间，一眼看见贝基坐在那儿，瞌睡中帽子歪到脑袋一侧。

“呀！”萨拉一见这情景禁不住轻轻叫了一声，“可怜的小家伙！”

萨拉发现自己心爱的坐椅被这衣衫褴褛的小人儿占了去，没有生气，事实上，她很乐意看到她坐在那儿。等这位在她的故事中被虐待的女主人公一醒来，她就能和她说话了。萨拉悄悄走过去，站在她跟前打量起来。贝基发出轻轻的鼾声。

“但愿她能自己醒来，”萨拉说，“我不愿意叫醒她。可要是让明卿小姐知道了，她会发脾气的。我再等几分钟吧。”

她在桌沿上坐下来，晃荡着那双玫瑰色的细腿，迟疑着不知做什么好。艾米丽亚小姐随时会进来，要那样，贝基肯定会挨骂的。

“可是她太累了，”萨拉心想，“确实太累了！”

就在萨拉左右为难的时候，一块烧得通红的煤块解了她的围。原来这煤块从一大煤块上迸裂出来，落到炉子的围栏上。贝基惊醒过来，睁开眼睛，吓得倒抽了一口冷气。她不知道自己睡着了。她只不过想坐一会儿，感受一下那炉火的美丽光辉——却发现自己正惊惶失措地望着这位神奇的学生，那学生高坐桌上，离她很近，像一位玫瑰色的仙女，关切地在打量自己。

贝基猛地跳了起来，去抓自己的帽子。她发觉帽子耷拉在耳朵上，慌忙把它扶正。唉，她这下可有大麻烦啦。竟然放肆地在这样一位年轻小姐的坐椅上睡熟了！她会被轰出大门，拿不到工钱的。

她发出一个声响，像是屏住呼吸，哽咽住了。

“啊，小姐，小姐！”她结结巴巴地说，“求你开恩，小姐，求你开开恩，小姐！”

萨拉从桌沿上跳下来，到了贝基跟前。

“别害怕，”萨拉说，就像面对着的是一位跟自己身份相同的小姑娘，“没事。”

“我不是有意的，小姐，”贝基申辩道，“都是那暖和的炉火——我也太累了。这——我可不是存心没规矩！”

萨拉忍不住友好地轻声笑起来，把一只手搭到贝基肩上。

“你是累了，”萨拉说，“你这也是身不由己。瞧你这会儿还没完全睡醒呢。”

贝基瞪眼望着她，样子多可怜啊！说真的，贝基从来没有见到有人用这么动听而友善的声音跟自己说话。对她来说，被人使唤、挨骂、吃耳光，已是家常便饭，她早已习以为常了。而这位小姐——穿着下午跳舞时的玫瑰色华丽服装——正望着她，好像她压根没有过错——她似乎有权疲劳时可以睡上一觉似的！还有，她的肩膀被那柔软纤巧的小手触摸，那感觉别说有多奇妙了。

“你不——不生气吧，小姐？”她心情紧张地问，“你不会告诉女东家吧？”

“不，”萨拉大声说，“当然不。”

那张被煤灰沾得黑不溜秋的脸上流露出惊慌失措的神色，萨拉一见这情景禁不住伤心起来，脑海里突然冒出了一个奇特的想法。她伸手捧住贝基的面颊。

“是啊，”萨拉说，“你我完全没有不同——我也是像你—样的小姑娘。要说我不是你，你不是我，那完全是意外造成的！”

贝基一点儿也不明白。她的头脑无法理解这样奇异的想法，而“意外”两字对她来说通常只意味着有人被车碾了或者从梯子上摔下来之类的灾难，需要被送进医院的。

“意外，小姐，”她恭恭敬敬地说，心头怦怦地跳着，“是吗？”

“是的。”萨拉回答，有点出神地看了贝基一会儿，接着就用完全不同的口气说话。她意识到贝基不明白她的话。

“活儿你干完了吗？”她问道，“你敢不敢在这儿再待几分钟？”

贝基又透不过气来了。

“这儿，小姐？我？”

萨拉跑到门口，打开门，朝外面看了看，听了听。

“附近没有人，”她解释道，“如果你把别的卧室都收拾好了，或许可以在这儿再多待一小会儿。我想——或许——你可能喜欢吃一块蛋糕吧。”

随后的十分钟对贝基来说，就像是做梦似的。萨拉打开食橱，递给她一大块蛋糕，开心地看着对方狼吞虎咽地把蛋糕吃了下去。然后和她说说笑笑，问这问那，最后贝基的畏惧心理慢慢地消失了，而且有那么一两次，贝基竟鼓足勇气主动提出一两个问题，觉得自己胆子够大了。

“那是——”贝基羡慕地看着那玫瑰色的连衣裙，壮着胆子问，声音低得近似耳语，“那是你最漂亮的吗？”

“我跳舞用的连衣裙有几件，这是其中的一件，”萨拉回答，“我喜欢这件，你喜欢吗？”

贝基仰慕得一时几乎说不出话来。随后她以敬畏的口气说：

“有一次我看到一位公主。我当时站在科文特公园歌剧院外面的大街上，和一群人一起，看到许许多多穿着时髦的人走进去。其中有一位，人人都争着看，都说‘那就是公主’。那位年轻小姐已是大人了，全身粉红色——长裙、披风，插着鲜花。我刚才看见你坐在桌子上的时候就想起了她，小姐。你看上去真像她。”

“我常想，”萨拉若有所思地说，“我倒是想成为一位公主，只是我不晓得做公主是什么样的感觉。我想我要开始装作自己就是一位公主了。”

贝基敬畏地瞪着她，和以前一样，一点儿也不明白她这话的意思，但还是用崇拜的目光注视着她。萨拉很快从沉思默想中回过神来，向贝基提出一个新问题。

“贝基，”她说，“那一次你不是听了那个故事吗？”

“是的，小姐，”贝基承认道，但心里有点惊慌，“我知道自己不该听，但是那故事太好听了，我——我忍不住听了起来。”

“我挺愿意让你听，”萨拉说，“讲故事的时候，最高兴的就是讲给那些想要听的人。我不明白为什么会这样。你想把那故事听完吗？”

贝基又兴奋得喘不过气来了。

“讲给我听？”她惊得高声道，“也把我当成是个学生，小姐！那故事讲那个王子——还有那些白色的小人鱼，嘻嘻哈哈地游来游去，头发里闪着星星，是吗？”

萨拉点点头。

“现在恐怕你没时间听了，”她说，“但是只要你能告诉我什么时候来收拾我的屋子，我就会尽可能待在这儿，每天给你讲一点，直到讲完为止。那是个又长又好听的故事——而且我总是不断增加一点儿新内容。”

“那样的话，”贝基喘了口气，热情地说，“要是我一心惦念着有故事听，不管煤箱有多重——不管那厨娘对我怎么样，我全不放在心上了。”

“你会有机会的，”萨拉说，“我会把那故事全都讲给你听的。”

贝基下楼时，已经不是原来那个被煤箱压弯了腰、摇摇晃晃上楼的贝基了。她衣袋里装着另外一块蛋糕，肚皮饱饱的，身上暖和和的。这不仅仅是由于蛋糕和炉火的作用，另外还有点儿什么使她不再感到饥饿和寒冷，那就是萨拉。

贝基走后，萨拉在桌子一端她的心爱位置上坐下来。她双脚搁在椅子上，胳膊肘支在膝盖上，双手托住下巴儿。

“要是我真的是公主——真正的公主，”她喃喃自语，“我就能赏赐平民老百姓了。但是即使我只是位假装的公主，我也能想出些办法，为老百姓做点事情。就像今天一样。刚才贝基不就是像得到赏赐那样，开心得不得了吗？我要假设做人们喜欢的事，就像是公主在赏赐。我已经这么做了。”





六　钻石矿


此后不久，发生了一件激动人心的事。不单是萨拉，学校里所有学生都这样认为，结果在事后好几个星期里，人们谈得最多的就是这话题。克鲁上尉来了一封信，提到一件极有趣的事。说是想不到一位少年时代的同学来印度看望他。那个朋友有很大一片土地，发现在那个地方有钻石，他正忙着开发钻石矿。他深信，假如所有的一切都像他预料的那样顺利的话，他就会成为拥有很大一笔财富的人，他将富得让人想起来都会觉得头昏眼花的。由于他非常喜欢自己学生时代的好朋友，因此就给克鲁上尉一个机会，让他成为这事业上的合伙人，在未来日子里可以共同享受这笔巨大财富。萨拉从父亲的那封信里看到的就这些情况。说实在的，要说别的事业，不问它的规划有多宏大，对她或者别的女孩，是不会有什么吸引力的，可是说到“钻石矿”，听起来简直是《天方夜谭》，没有人不为之动心。在萨拉想象中，这事儿太迷人了，于是她有声有色地给埃芒加德与洛蒂描绘出一些图景，描绘出地心深处那如同迷宫一般的通道，通道的墙上、顶部以及顶篷上都缀满了各种光华夺目的宝石，一些皮肤黝黑的怪人正在用笨重的鹤嘴锄将宝石掘出。埃芒加德兴高采烈地听着这故事，而洛蒂非要她每天晚上再给重新讲一遍不可。这令拉维尼亚感觉到十分的恼火，她跟杰西说，她压根就不相信会有钻石矿这档子事。

“我妈妈的那只钻石戒指，值四十镑呢，”拉维尼亚说，“可是那并不是最大的。要是他所有的矿山上全是钻石，那该多富有，这事儿太荒唐可笑了。”

“没准萨拉真富得让人觉得荒唐可笑哩。”杰西说着发出咯咯的笑声。

“她就是不富也够荒唐可笑的了。”拉维尼亚哼了一声。

“我想你一准恨她。”杰西说。

“不，我才不恨她，”拉维尼亚狠狠地说道，“我就是不相信那些矿全是钻石。”

“可是，钻石总得从哪个地方挖出来吧，”杰西说，“拉维尼亚，你猜格特鲁德怎么说的？”她说罢又咯咯地笑了起来。

“我不知道，确实不知道。要是说的又是那个没完没了萨拉的事，我可不爱听。”

“可不是，说的正是萨拉。说她装模作样把自己当成是公主。她一直在玩这把戏——又一个‘假设’的把戏。她老在玩——连在学校里也玩，她说这么一来才能把功课学得更好。她还想让埃芒加德也装成是公主，可埃芒加德说自己太胖了。”

“她是太胖了，”拉维尼亚说，“萨拉呢，又太瘦了。”

杰西听了自然又发出一阵咯咯的笑声。

“她说这跟人的模样和财富没半点关系，关键是你怎么想、怎么做。”

“看来她认为，即使自己是叫花子也能成为公主。”拉维尼亚说，“往后咱们管她叫‘公主殿下’得了。”

一天里所有的课程都结束了，她们就坐在教室的炉火前享受着最快乐的时光。这时候明卿小姐与艾米丽亚小姐坐在那个神圣不可侵犯的起居室里享用下午茶。这样的时刻里，要是女孩子们，尤其是那些年龄小一些的孩子，表现得规规矩矩，不乱吵瞎嚷嚷，不到处乱跑，她们就有足够的时间交谈了，她们可以交换许多秘密——不过必须承认，吵吵闹闹是小女孩子的家常便饭。每当她们大吵大闹时，大一些的女孩就会责骂她们，撵她们走。大家都希望这些小家伙能够遵守纪律，不然的话，麻烦就大了，明卿小姐或者艾米丽亚小姐就会过来干涉，眼看着快活的时光这就泡汤了。就在拉维尼亚说话的时候，房门打开，萨拉领着洛蒂走了进来。照例，萨拉走到哪里，洛蒂像只小狗，一路小跑，紧跟在萨拉的身后。

“她过来了，还领着那个讨人厌的屁孩！”拉维尼亚凑着杰西的耳朵说，“要是她那么喜欢洛蒂，干吗不让她待在自己的屋子里？用不了五分钟，洛蒂准会为什么事嚷嚷起来了。”

洛蒂没来由突然想到要来教室玩，硬是求自己的“代理妈妈”一起去。洛蒂跑到教室一个角落，跟几个小家伙玩了起来，萨拉则蜷起身子，坐在窗台上，翻开一本书读了起来。那是一本有关法国大革命的书，她立刻就让一段描写巴士底监狱里的囚犯那种悲凄情景吸引住了——那些在地牢里关了许多年的人们，被人营救出来的时候，满头灰白长发，满脸灰白胡子，几乎已经忘了外部还有另一个世界存在，个个像是生活在梦幻里的幽灵。

她的心已经远远地离开了教室，洛蒂的哭叫声硬生生地把她拖回到现实，叫她很不舒服。正在聚精会神地看着书，猛可里被打扰，这时候不让自己发火实在是件难之又难的事儿。酷爱读书的人都知道，这种时候不可避免就会发脾气，失去了理智，冲动起来就会无端骂人，想克制也克制不了。

“那让我觉得就像是挨了人一顿打似的，”有一次萨拉私底下对埃芒加德说，“要是这时候我想动手还击，那我得立刻想些别的事，免得说出一些难听的话来。”

萨拉把书留在窗台上，跳下来离开那个让她觉得舒心的地方，这时候她肯定赶紧去想一些别的事情。

原来是洛蒂从教室的地板上滑了过去，叫了起来，激怒了拉维尼亚与杰西。随后她又摔了一跤，摔伤了那胖乎乎的膝盖。于是在一群小伙伴与冤家对头中间大呼小叫、上蹿下跳起来。有人哄她、劝她，也有人骂她、咒她，场面好不热闹。

“别闹了，你这哭丧鬼！别瞎闹了！”拉维尼亚怒斥道。

“我不是哭——丧鬼——我不是！”洛蒂哭着说，“萨拉，萨——拉！”

“要是让她再闹下去，明卿小姐准会听到，”杰西大声道，“亲爱的洛蒂，我给你一个便士得了！”

“谁要你的钱。”洛蒂哽咽着，低下头看着自己胖胖的膝盖，看到了一滴血，于是又一次大声哭起来。

萨拉飞快地穿过教室，跪了下去，伸出双臂将她搂在怀里。

“行了，洛蒂，”萨拉说，“行了，洛蒂，你可是向萨拉保证过的。”

“可她把我说成是个哭丧鬼。”洛蒂哭哭啼啼地说。

萨拉用手拍着哄她，并且用洛蒂熟悉的坚定语气说话：

“可要是你再这样哭下去，那你真的成哭丧鬼了，亲爱的洛蒂。你可是保证过的。”

此刻洛蒂虽然想起自己说过的话，但她觉得还是扯着嗓子好。

“我没有妈妈了，”她郑重其事地说，“我没有——真的——没有妈妈。”

“不对，你有妈妈，”萨拉爽朗地说，“你忘了吗？你不认为萨拉就是你的妈妈吗？你不愿意让萨拉成为你妈妈吗？”

洛蒂依偎在萨拉的怀里，宽慰地抽了抽鼻子。

“过来，咱俩一起坐到窗台上去，”萨拉接着说，“让我悄悄给你说个故事。”

“真的吗？”洛蒂抽泣着说，“你愿意——为我——讲有关钻石矿的故事吗？”

“钻石矿？”拉维尼亚猛然插进话来，“这个被惯坏了、讨人厌的小家伙，我真想赏她一记耳光！”

萨拉猛地站了起来。大伙儿应该还没忘记，刚刚她那么全神贯注地在读的那本关于巴士底监狱的书，而且当她感觉到一定要去照应自己“养女”的时候，非得立即去想一些其他的事。她毕竟不是天使，而且一点儿也不喜欢拉维尼亚。

“好啊，”萨拉带着些火气说，“我得赏你一记耳光——可是我没这个心情！”她克制着怒火，“起码我很想赏你一记耳光——应该赏你——但我不会动手。我们与那些街头流浪儿不同，咱们年龄不小了，该懂事了。”

拉维尼亚终于逮到了机会。

“哎哟哟，可不是，高贵的殿下，”她说，“看来咱们都是公主，咱们之中至少有一个是公主。这里应该说是一所名牌学校了，竟然有一位公主做起明卿小姐的学生了。”

萨拉向她冲了上去，显然就要真的给对方一记耳光，或许她确实想这么做。她那个“假装”的游戏是她生活中的一大乐趣，她从来不曾把这事告诉过那些不为她所喜欢的人。最近她想象自己是公主，她非常珍惜这种新“想象”，同时也使她变得非常羞涩，非常敏感。她有意要让它成为一个秘密，然而拉维尼亚却当着差不多全校学生的面来嘲笑她。她感觉到脸上有一股热血涌了上来，耳朵里嗡嗡作响，她显然已是忍无可忍了。然而此时她猛然间又想起，假如你是一位公主，那么公主是不会动怒的。于是她垂下了双手，一动不动地站了片刻，后来当她开口说话的时候，声音是镇定的、平和的。她扬起头来，大家都在听着她说些什么。

“没错，”她说，“有时候我的确假装自己真的是位公主，只要我这样想，就可以努力让自己的一举一动像个真正的公主。”

拉维尼亚一时之间不知如何回答。有好几次，在她与萨拉的较量中，自己根本想不出有效的办法来对付。那是因为其他的人总是暗中站在她的对手那边。此时此刻，她看到所有的人都兴趣盎然地竖着耳朵听。事实上她们都喜欢公主，并且渴望从面前这位公主口中听到一些更加确切的情况，于是她们显然向萨拉靠拢过来。

拉维尼亚现在想到的只有一句话，但听来苍白无力。

“好哇！”她说，“但愿你在登上公主宝座的时候，别忘了我们。”

“我决不会。”萨拉说，依然一动不动地站在原地，一个字也没有多说，镇定地看着拉维尼亚，看着她扯着杰西的手臂，转身离开了。

从此之后，一些对萨拉有着嫉妒心的女孩子，在想要对她表示特别轻蔑时，常常称她为“萨拉公主”；而这称呼在一些欢喜她的女孩子中间，则表示对她亲密。其实并没有人会用“公主”来称呼萨拉，但是这个别致而高贵的称呼很为仰慕她的人所喜欢。明卿小姐听了后，曾多次向来学校的学生家长提起，她认为那样会让人觉得自己的寄宿学校有了皇家的气派。

在贝基看来，这样称呼萨拉是世上最恰如其分的做法。回想那个雾茫茫的下午，她与萨拉相识。当时她从睡梦中惊醒，跳起来离开那把舒服的椅子，自那以后到如今，她俩的友情已发展得相当成熟，相当深厚了。但是必须承认，明卿小姐和艾米丽亚小姐对此事还蒙在鼓里。她俩只知道，萨拉对这个厨房里干杂活的小丫头非常“友好”，可是并不清楚贝基飞快地收拾好楼上的每一个房间后，到了萨拉的房间，将笨重的煤箱放在地上，欣喜地舒了口气，冒着风险匆匆享受到片刻的欢乐。其间，萨拉把故事一段段陆续讲给她听，时不时把好吃的东西塞给贝基，让她当下吃下，要么匆匆塞进她的口袋里，好带回楼上的阁楼里睡觉之前消受。

“可是我一定得很小心地吃，小姐，”有一次贝基说，“要是碎屑掉在地上，就会有耗子跑出来吃。”

“耗子！”萨拉惊呼道，“你住的地方有耗子吗？”

“多极了，小姐，”贝基老老实实地答道，“阁楼里大的、小的耗子全有。它们四处乱窜，奔跑时发出来的声音我听惯了，也就不当回事了。小姐，有什么法子，只要不跑到我枕头上来，我就不理会了。”

“哎哟！”萨拉说。

“时间久了，什么事全会慢慢习惯的。”贝基说，“小姐，假如你生下来就是个干厨房杂活的丫头，你也就认了。还好是耗子，而不是蟑螂。”

“我也这么想，”萨拉说，“我想或许迟早有一天你能够与耗子成为朋友的，我知道我一定不会愿意与蟑螂做朋友。”

有时候贝基是不敢在那个亮堂堂、暖融融的屋子里多待一小会儿的，这时，她俩只能说上几句话，然后萨拉便往贝基裙子底下那个老式口袋里塞进一种买来的小物品。那只口袋是贝基用布带子拴在腰间的。于是寻找到那种既可以吃得饱又可以包成小包的食物成了萨拉生活中一件特别感兴趣的事。每逢她坐车或者步行外出时，时常热切地张望商店里的橱窗。她最初一次决定买回两三个肉馅饼时，她觉得那绝对是一个重大的发现。当她拿出来让贝基看时，贝基的眼睛一下子亮了起来。

“噢，小姐！”贝基喃喃道，“这种东西又好吃，又可以饱肚子。填饱肚子那才是最要紧的事。松糕是好吃，可一下子就融化了——要是你对这些明白了就好了，小姐。肉馅饼这种玩意儿就能久久留在肚皮里。”

“可是，”萨拉有一些迟疑，“要是它们一直留在胃里，我觉得也不是一件好事，不过我相信，它可以让你不感到饿。”

肉馅饼的确令人满意——从餐馆里买夹牛肉的三明治也一样，还有卷饼和意大利大红肠同样也耐饥。慢慢地，贝基不再感到饥饿与疲劳，煤箱拎起来也不觉得太沉重了。

不管煤箱有多重，也不管那厨娘的脾气有多坏，压在她肩上的活儿有多苦，贝基始终盼着下午那美好时光的到来——盼着萨拉小姐会待在自己的起居室里。事实上，就算是没有肉馅饼，只要与萨拉见上一面也就心满意足了。假如只有能说几句话的时间，她们的交谈也是友好的、暖人心的；假如时间充裕，那么就会接着上一次的故事讲下去，要么讲一些令她难忘的事，有时候回到阁楼，醒着躺在床上值得好好回味一番。对萨拉来说，她认为自己所做的一切都是下意识间最喜欢做的事，既然她生性就是位施予者，她全然没有想到自己对可怜的贝基起多大作用，也没有意识到自己是个多么重要的恩人。如果说她成为施予者是天性使然，那么她天生就是慷慨的，心灵也是善良的。即便有时你一无所有，你的心灵始终是充实的，你可以随时以心灵施予他人温暖、友善和美好的东西——帮助、慰藉和笑声——有时候恰恰是快乐和友善的笑声对人帮助最大。

贝基可怜的、饱受奴役的幼小生命与笑声是无缘的。是萨拉让她笑起来，并且与她一起欢笑，虽然她俩都不清楚，但笑声如同肉馅饼，同样可以用来“充饥”的。

就在萨拉十一岁生日的前几个星期，她收到父亲寄来的信，信并没像过去那样写得充满天真和高昂的情绪，也不那么兴高采烈了。他身体不太好，很明显这是由于钻石矿的工作太繁重引起的。

“你要明白，小萨拉，”他写道，“你爹原不是个做生意的料，那些数字和文牍搅得我烦透了。我对这类事完全是门外汉，可事儿又是那么多。或许要是我不为这类事焦虑操心，就不会上半夜里翻来覆去睡不着，到了下半夜就算是睡着了也是噩梦连连。要是有我的‘小主妇’在身边，我断定她会郑重其事地为我提出一些好主意的。你一准会的，是吗，我的‘小主妇’？”

克鲁上尉跟萨拉开过不少玩笑，称她“小主妇”便是其中之一，因为她一向就少年老成。

他为萨拉的这个生日做了精心的准备。除了别的东西外，还特地从巴黎新订购来一个洋娃娃，并为那洋娃娃配备了全套服装，件件精美绝伦，叹为观止。他在信里问她对于那个洋娃娃满不满意，萨拉的回答却让人出乎意料。

“我已经长大了，”她写道，“你要明白，我再也不能让你送我洋娃娃当礼物了。这个就算是我最后的洋娃娃了。这该是一桩神圣的事。要是我能够写诗，我觉得‘最后的洋娃娃’这样的诗肯定非常优美。可是我还写不了诗，我试过，可是那东西读起来定会让人笑掉牙的。听起来与诗人瓦茨、柯勒律治或莎士比亚压根没法比。爱米丽的地位是无论谁都无法取代的，当然我还是会十分尊重这个‘最后的洋娃娃’，而且我敢肯定全校的女孩们都会喜欢她的。她们都喜欢洋娃娃的，尽管当中有一些大一点的孩子——快要满十五岁的——自称已经长大成人，不再喜欢了。”

克鲁上尉在印度那所平房里读着这封信的时候，头正痛得厉害。他面前的桌子摊着一大堆的文件和信函，这些东西弄得他心烦意乱，忧心忡忡，可是，读着萨拉的信他笑开了，不是吗，自己已经有好几个星期没笑过了。

“噢，”他说，“她一年比一年变得更有趣了。但愿老天保佑这桩生意顺顺利利，到时候我就能抽空回国看望她了。要是这时候她的小胳膊搂住我的脖子，让我付出天大的代价也愿意！什么代价都愿意！”

萨拉生日那天要大大庆祝一番，要把教室好好布置布置，还将要举办一次聚会。要隆重地打开那些装礼品的盒子，在明卿小姐那间神圣的屋子里将摆出让人看得眼花缭乱的食品。到了那一天，整座屋子洋溢着兴奋激动的气氛。谁也记不得那一个上午是如何过去的，因为要准备的事儿太多了，人人都忙着。教室里装饰着冬青编成的花环，搬走了课桌，四周靠墙放着一排长凳，上面蒙着红套子。

清晨，萨拉走进自己的起居室，她看见桌子上有一只鼓鼓囊囊的小包，外面裹着牛皮纸，扎上绳子。一看就知道那是礼物，猜得出来那是谁送的。她小心翼翼地打开来，原来那是一个正方形的针插，用不太干净的红色法兰绒做成的，上面细心地插上一枚枚黑色的大头针，组成一行字：生日快乐。

“啊！”萨拉心里涌上一股暖流，“她花了多少心血呀！我太喜欢了，它——它太让人过意不去。”

然而，这事儿实在叫人摸不着头脑。原来大头针下面还有一张名片，端端正正印着：“艾米丽亚·明卿小姐。”

萨拉翻来覆去看了又看。

“艾米丽亚·明卿小姐！”她自言自语道，“怎么可能呢？”

就在这时，她听见有人小心翼翼地推开房门，只见贝基站在门口望着她。

贝基满怀着深情，脸上漾起兴奋的笑容，她挪动着双脚，到了萨拉跟前，不安地揉搓着自己的手指。

“你喜欢吗，萨拉小姐？”她说，“喜欢吗？”

“还用问？”萨拉高声道，“亲爱的贝基，全是你亲手一针一线做的啊。”

贝基高兴得猛吸一下鼻子，激动得双眼噙满了泪花。

“算不上什么好东西，只有法兰绒，还不是新的，但我总是在想应该送你点什么，花了好几个晚上做出来了。我很清楚你是会装作是缎子做的，插着钻石大头针。我一边做一边就这么样想。要说那名片，小姐，”她说得吞吞吐吐，“我是从垃圾箱里捡出来的，这样做不会有什么不好吧？那是艾米丽亚小姐扔在那儿的。我自己没有名片，可要是没有名片，那就不是像模像样的礼物——没法子，我只能用了艾米丽亚小姐的。”

萨拉扑过去搂住贝基，无论是对自己还是对别人，她都说不清：为什么自己的喉头哽咽了。

“哦，贝基！”她脸上挂着不寻常的笑意，大声道，“我爱你，贝基——真的爱你，真的！”

“哦，小姐！”贝基小声说，“感谢你，小姐，衷心地感谢你！算不得是好礼物。法兰绒——是旧的。”





七　钻石矿（续）


下午，萨拉领着大伙，身后像是跟着大队人马，走进饰着冬青的教室。明卿小姐身穿最华丽的丝绸长裙，一只手挽着她。那个装着“最后的洋娃娃”的盒子由一个男仆捧着，跟随其后，第二只礼盒由一名女仆捧着，而在队伍的最后是贝基，她捧着第三只礼盒，身上围着一条干净的围裙，头上戴着一顶新帽子。萨拉更愿意像平常那样走进教室，可是明卿小姐让人把她找来，在自己的起居室和她谈了一回，说明了她的想法。

“这种场合非同一般，”她说，“我可不愿意当作一件普普通通的事来办。”

于是萨拉被隆重地请进了教室。她一进教室，年龄大点的女孩子都瞪大眼睛看着她，相互碰碰胳膊肘，而岁数小的姑娘们坐在位置上，身子快活地扭动着，这场面让萨拉感到很不自在。

“肃静，小姐们！”面对着响起的叽叽喳喳声，明卿小姐说了起来，“詹姆斯，把你手中的盒子放到桌子上，打开它。埃玛，你拿的盒子就放在椅子上——贝基！”

贝基高兴得忘了形，她正咧开了嘴朝洛蒂笑，洛蒂也欢天喜地挪动着身子，满怀期待。贝基一听那一声呵斥吓了一跳，几乎把盒子跌落在地上，慌慌张张行了屈膝礼表示歉意，那滑稽的模样，惹得拉维尼亚与杰西一阵哄笑。

“这里不是你待的地方，还轮不到你盯着小姐看，”明卿小姐说，“你别忘了自己的身份！放下手中拿着的盒子。”

贝基受到训斥，赶忙慌慌张张地向门口退去。

“你们都下去吧。”明卿小姐说着，向仆人挥了挥手。

贝基毕恭毕敬地闪到一边，好让那些高一等的仆人先走出去。她忍不住以羡慕的眼神朝桌子上的那只盒子瞥了一眼，在那薄薄的包装纸的折痕间，隐隐约约看出里面装着用蓝色绸缎做的东西。

“明卿小姐，”萨拉突然说，“请允许留下贝基，好不好？”

这要求太大胆无礼了，明卿小姐听了身子不禁抖了抖，随后推了推眼镜，心烦意乱地打量着这个“示范生”。

“你说贝基！”她大声说，“我亲爱的萨拉！”

萨拉朝明卿小姐走近一步。

“我要她留下，因为我知道她非常想看看这些礼物，”萨拉解释说，“你知道，她也是个小女孩。”

明卿小姐觉得很震惊。她看了看萨拉，又看了看贝基。

“我亲爱的萨拉，”她说，“贝基只是一个在厨房里干活的下人，厨房里的下人——嗯——不配称小姑娘。”

明卿小姐确实从来就是这么看待下人的，她们只不过是搬搬煤箱、生生火炉的工具罢了。

“可贝基就是小女孩，”萨拉说，“我知道她待在这里会感到快乐的，请你留下她吧——因为今天是我在过生日。”

明卿小姐板着脸孔回答说：

“如果你一定要把这个当成是对你生日的特别照顾——那就留下她吧，丽贝卡，过来，感谢萨拉小姐对你的一片好心。”

贝基已经一直退到了房间的角落里，正兴奋不安地揉着围裙褶边，听了这话便朝前走了几步，连连行起屈膝礼，同时与萨拉交换相互理解而友爱的眼色，然后结结巴巴地说：

“哦，要是你答应的话，小姐！那我太感谢了，小姐！我太想看看那个洋娃娃了，小姐，真的。感谢你，小姐。也要感谢你，夫人，”——说到这里她又慌慌张张转身向明卿小姐行了个屈膝礼——“谢谢你开恩让我留下来。”

明卿小姐又朝她挥了挥手——这次的方向是朝着靠近门口那个角落。

“去，站到那边去，”她命令道，“离小姐们远点儿。”

贝基几乎要笑得合不拢嘴了，走了过去。待在哪儿她不在乎，在这欢天喜地的时刻，只要可以幸运地待在这教室里，而不是在楼下的洗碗池旁，她就心满意足了，所以没有注意到这时候明卿小姐已经清了清嗓子，说明她又要开腔了。

“听我说，诸位小姐，我有话要对你们说。”她道。

“她这就要发表演说了，”一个女孩小声地说，“但愿她到此为止，不再说下去。”

萨拉感觉到有点不自在。不是吗，这是为她举行的聚会，演说中难免不讲到她，身在教室里，听人家发表有关自己的演说，这滋味可不好受。

“小姐们，你们很清楚，”演说就这么开始了——那可算得上是一次地地道道的演说，“今天亲爱的萨拉已经十一周岁了。”

“还亲爱的萨拉哩！”拉维尼亚低声道。

“你们当中也有几位同样是十一岁，可是萨拉的生日与别的小女孩的生日有所不同。将来等她长大了，她会拥有很大一笔财富，她未来的职责就是如何有价值地用好这笔财富。”

“说的是钻石矿。”杰西小声说，发出“嗤嗤”的笑声。

这话萨拉没有听到，她只是站在那儿，用灰绿色的眼睛直勾勾地瞅着明卿小姐，觉得浑身热烘烘的。明卿小姐一提到钱，萨拉就会不由自主地感觉到自己对明卿小姐生出一股恨意——自然啰，恨年长的人有失体统。

“克鲁上尉，也就是她敬爱的父亲当年将她从印度送到这儿托我照管，”演说还在继续，“他就以半开玩笑的口气对我说：‘说不定她日后会很富有，明卿小姐。’我回答说：‘她在我的学校所得到的教育，克鲁上尉，将为那笔最巨大的财富锦上添花。’如今萨拉已经是我培养出来的最十全十美的女孩了。她的法语和舞蹈是我的学校的一大骄傲，她完美的风度——不愧被你们称之为‘萨拉公主’。你们受邀参加今天下午的聚会，足以表示她是友善可亲的。我希望诸位对她的慷慨表示感谢，齐声高呼：‘感谢你，萨拉！’”

教室里所有的人“哗”地站了起来，这情景使萨拉清楚地想起那天上午的事。

“感谢你，萨拉！”人们齐声道，特别是洛蒂，兴奋得蹦蹦跳跳起来。一时间萨拉看上去有点不好意思。她行了个屈膝礼——表现得优雅之极。

“大家来参加我的生日聚会，我表示感谢。”她说。

“你表现得非常出色，萨拉，”明卿小姐夸道，“真正的公主在臣民们向她欢呼时就该这样。拉维尼亚！”说到这里，她的语气变得严厉起来，“你刚刚很像是用鼻子哼了一声。假如你对自己同学心存忌妒，我希望你用更文雅的方式来表现自己的情感。好了，我要走了，你们尽情玩乐吧。”

只要有明卿小姐在，学生们就觉得有种魔力使她们感到压抑。她刚快步离开教室，转瞬之间这种魔力立即消遁了。没等房门关上，座位上顿时不见了人影。年龄小些的姑娘们迫不及待地从座位上跳下来，或翻滚下来，大一些的孩子们也急匆匆地离了座。所有的人都向那几个装着礼物的盒子涌了过去。萨拉笑容满面，在一个盒子前俯下了身子。

“我知道，这里是书。”她说。

一些年纪小一些的孩子扫兴地发出一阵哼哼声，埃芒加德也感觉到十分惊讶。

“你爸爸送书给你做生日礼物？”她嚷嚷道，“哎哟哟，他跟我爸爸一样差劲。不要打开，萨拉。”

“我可喜欢书哩。”萨拉笑着说，不过她还是转身到了那个特别大的盒子。她把那个“最后的洋娃娃”抱了出来。这洋娃娃美极了，孩子们见了高兴得发出一片赞美声和叹息声，便屏住呼吸，后退几步，细细端详起来。

“她差不多和洛蒂一样大。”一个孩子气喘吁吁地说。

洛蒂拍起了手，连蹦带跳，咯咯笑着。

“她身上穿的是去看戏的盛装，”拉维尼亚说，“披风的衬里子是貂皮做的。”

“噢！”埃芒加德边喊边挤上前来，“她手中握着的小望远镜也是看戏用的——是金蓝相间的颜色呢。”

“这是她的衣箱，”萨拉说，“打开来看看她有哪些东西。”

萨拉坐在地板上，扭动钥匙。四周挤满了吵吵闹闹的女孩们，看着她拿出的一只只隔屉里装着什么东西。教室里从来没有出现过这样喧闹的场面。箱子里装着有花边的衣领、长筒丝袜和手绢；有一只首饰盒，里面有一串项链、一顶冕状头饰，看上去是用真正的钻石点缀而成的；一件长大衣是海豹皮做的，外带暖手筒；有好几套参加舞会、室外散步和出门做客时穿的服装；并且还有各种式样的帽子、茶会装与扇子。连拉维尼亚和杰西也忘了自己早已过了玩洋娃娃的年纪，兴奋得大呼小叫起来，拿起一些东西细细端详。

“假设，”萨拉说。她靠着桌子，给那位拥有所有豪华的服饰、脸上永远挂着微笑的洋娃娃头上戴上一顶黑色天鹅绒大礼帽，“假如说她能够明白人说话，看见受到大家赞美，她一准会很得意。”

“你老是‘假设、假设’的。”拉维尼亚说，摆出高人一等的架势。

“这我知道，”萨拉坦然答道，“我喜欢假设，假设比什么都要美妙，那简直成了神仙了。要是你尽心尽力去假设，结果就会像真的一样了。”

“要是你什么也不缺，假设起来就不难，”拉维尼亚说，“要是是个住在阁楼里的叫花子，你还能假设或假装吗？”

萨拉不再整理“最后的洋娃娃”的鸵鸟羽饰，陷入了沉思。

“我相信，我还是可以的，”她说，“要是成了叫花子，那更得随时假设和假装，只是做起来有点难。”

从那以后她时常想道：多么不可思议，她刚刚说完这句话——正好就是这个时刻——艾米丽亚小姐走了进来。

“萨拉，”她说，“你父亲的律师巴罗先生来约见明卿小姐，她一定得单独与巴罗先生谈谈，茶点已经在她的客厅里摆好了，你们现在就过去受用，好让我姐姐在教室里接见客人。”

好吃的点心无论在什么时候都不会讨人厌的，大家一听这话，眼睛里无不闪出喜悦的光彩来。艾米丽亚小姐排好队，让萨拉站在自己的身旁，大家跟着她离开了教室，那个“最后的洋娃娃”独自留在椅子上，四周散落着一大摊华丽的服饰，椅背上搭着各式的衣服与外套，那一堆堆镶着花边的裙子散落在学生们的座位上。

贝基自然没资格享用茶点，可她不顾自己的身份，没有立刻就走，好多看几眼那些好东西——她这举动确实太冒失了！

“回去干活，贝基！”虽然艾米丽亚小姐已经吩咐过她了，但她还是没离开，先是诚惶诚恐地拣起了一只皮手套，随后是一件外套，站在那儿羡慕地欣赏，猛听见明卿小姐来到门口，这才想起自己如此不规矩的举动定会遭到斥责，不觉惊慌起来，情急之下她钻到了桌子下面，桌布正好把她遮住了。

明卿小姐走进教室，跟她一起的一位绅士，面部的轮廓清晰，皮肤干瘪，个子矮小，显得心神不宁的样子。应该说，明卿小姐本人也显得心烦意乱，她盯着这位干枯的小老头儿，脸上是懊恼与疑惑的表情。

她端着架子，态度十分僵硬，坐下后，挥着手，给他指了一张椅子。

“请坐，巴罗先生。”她说。

巴罗先生并没有马上坐下。他的注意力似乎被“最后的洋娃娃”和她四周的服饰吸引住了。他将眼镜扶正，对它们表示了烦躁与不满。然而那“最后的洋娃娃”却是一副根本就不在乎的表情。它径自笔挺地坐着，漠然地回望对方的注视。

“一百英镑，”巴罗先生开门见山冒出的就这么一句话，“都是些昂贵的布料，而且出自巴黎的一位女裁缝之手，他花钱确实太大手大脚了，那个年轻人！”

明卿小姐觉得恼火。这话显然毁谤了她最得意的顾主，真是放肆之极。

就算是律师也没有权力如此放肆！

“非常抱歉，巴罗先生，”她冷淡地说，“我不明白你的意思。”

“生日礼物，”巴罗先生说，依然是那种不满的口气，“送给一个十一岁的孩子！按我说，如此的奢侈，他这是疯了。”

明卿小姐挺起胸，身体更加僵直。

“克鲁上尉是个有钱的人，”她说，“单就钻石矿——”

巴罗先生朝她转过身。

“钻石矿？”他猛然间叫嚷起来，“压根是没影儿的事！从来就没存在过！”

明卿小姐“霍”地从椅子上跳了起来。

“什么！”她喊了起来，“你说什么？”

“反正，”巴罗先生没好气地答道，“要是一开头就没有的话，事情倒更好些。”

“什么钻石矿也没有？”明卿小姐禁不住喊了起来，一把抓住椅子的椅背，只觉得一场美梦正在破灭。

“钻石矿所招来的是破产，而不是财富，”巴罗先生说，“一个人把自己全交到一位自己密友手里，自己又不懂经营之道，那么最好还是别跟这个密友投资什么钻石矿、金矿，或其他任何的矿业。那位已故的克鲁上尉——”

一听这话明卿小姐倒抽了一口冷气，惹得巴罗先生打住了话头。

“已故的克鲁上尉！”她喊道，“已故的！你不要对我说克鲁上尉已经——”

“他死了，夫人，”巴罗先生回答得急促而不留情面，“死于丛林热病和商务上麻烦的交相折磨。假如没有那商务上的烦恼害得他精神崩溃，单是丛林热病可能还不至于置他于死地；生意场上的烦恼，而没有丛林热病，也未必要了他的命。总而言之克鲁上尉死了！”

明卿小姐又一屁股跌回椅子上，他所说的一切让她的内心充满了恐惧。

“他的生意出了什么样的麻烦？”她问，“到底是怎么回事？”

“钻石矿，”巴罗先生答道，“还有他亲密的朋友——破产了。”

明卿小姐几乎透不过气来了。

“破产了！”她喘着大气说。

“分毫都没能留下。那年轻人有的是钱，而那位亲密的朋友为开采钻石矿迷了心窍，他自己的和克鲁上尉的全部财产都投进去了，事后这位亲密的朋友逃之夭夭——这个消息传来的时候，克鲁上尉正害丛林热病。他无法承受这样大的打击，他死的时候精神错乱，昏迷之中一直呼喊着他的小女儿——却一个子儿也没有留下。”

此时明卿小姐终于明白了到底出了什么事，她生平从未受到过这样大的打击。重击之下，自己的“示范生”，那个可以供她炫耀的顾主，从此从这所优等学校中一去不复返了。她感到自己像是受到凌辱，遭到劫掠，这场灾难全是克鲁上尉、萨拉以及巴罗先生造成的。

“你的意思是要对我说，”她喊道，“他什么也没留下？萨拉将得不到任何财产？那孩子成了叫花子？留在我的手里的只是一个小乞丐，而不是女继承人？”

巴罗先生绝对是一个精明的有商业头脑的人，他觉得如今让自己从这件事中摆脱干系，且刻不容缓，方是上上之策。

“她确实成了个叫花子了，”他答道，“而且肯定要托你来照管，太太，据我们所知，在这个世上她一个亲人也没有了。”

明卿小姐向前跑去，像是要打开房门，冲出去阻止此刻正在举行的欢快而热烈的茶会。

“荒唐之极！”她说，“此时此刻还正待在我的客厅里，一身绫罗绸缎，花我的钱举办聚会。”

“假如她正在举办的聚会，夫人，花的是你的钱，”巴罗先生不慌不忙地说，“巴罗与斯基普沃思律师事务所可不负任何责任。从未见过谁的财产这等彻底一扫而光。克鲁上尉还不曾支付给我们那笔最后的账单就死了——那可是很大的一笔钱哪！”

明卿小姐在房门口转过身，她更加恼怒了，她连做梦也没有想到情况会这样糟。

“我倒是摊上了这样的倒霉事儿！”她嚷道，“我一向深信他会付款的，所以我才在这孩子身上垫付了那么多荒唐的钱。那个荒唐的洋娃娃、那一大堆荒诞古怪的服饰的账全是我付的。这孩子想要什么就得到什么，她有一辆马车、一匹矮种马和一名女仆，然而除了前一次收到的银行支票之外，这一切全是我垫付的。”

巴罗先生在明明白白、干脆利落地表明了事务所的立场，交代了冷酷的事实后，显然无意再待下去听明卿小姐大叹苦经了，他对这位气冲冲的寄宿学校管理人尚缺特殊的同情心。

“你最好还是不要再为她花钱了，夫人，”他说，“要是你愿意给那小姐送什么礼物则另当别论。不过甭想哪个会记得你的情，她现在可是身无分文了。”

“那叫我如何是好？”明卿小姐问，似乎觉得对方有责任帮她挽回局面，“倒是叫我如何是好？”

“毫无办法，”巴罗先生收起折叠眼镜，插在衣袋里，说，“克鲁上尉死了，那孩子变成了叫花子，除了你，谁也负不了照管她的责任。”

“我不能为她负责，我拒绝负责！”

明卿小姐气得脸色发白。

巴罗先生转身就要离开。

“这不关我的事，夫人，”他冷冷地说，“巴罗与斯基普沃思律师事务所对此毫无责任。当然，发生这样的事，我只能表示遗憾。”

“要是你硬要把她强塞给我，那就大错特错了，”明卿小姐气呼呼地说，“我已经遭到欺骗、被劫掠了，我会把她赶到大街上去！”

要不是她气急败坏之极，她是不可能说出这番失策的话来的，她一直憎恨这个从小就娇生惯养的孩子，想不到如今却成了她身上的包袱，她能不失去自制力吗？

巴罗先生若无其事地向门口走去。

“换了我，就不会那么做，夫人，”他说，“那样有失体面，有损学校的流言蜚语就会传播出去。说学校因为学生没有钱，又无依无靠，便要把她扫地出门。”

巴罗先生是个精明的生意人，知道自己说话的分量。他很清楚，明卿小姐也有生意人的头脑，绝对精明，看得清利害关系，不会让人有口实，说她铁石心肠，干出冷酷无情的事来。

“最好还是留下她，利用她，”他紧接着说，“我认为，她是个聪明的女孩，等她长大了，你定会从她身上捞到许多好处的。”

“不用等到她长大，我就要从她身上捞到许多好处。”明卿小姐嚷嚷道。

“我肯定你会的，夫人，”巴罗先生说，一丝阴险的笑容从他的脸上流露出来，“我肯定你会的。再见！”

他鞠了一躬退了出去，随后带上门。应该承认，有好几分钟明卿小姐站在那儿对着门干瞪眼。刚才他所说的完全正确，这一点她很清楚，她绝对没有回旋的余地了。那个可以供她炫耀的学生已不复存在，现在只是个无依无靠而—文不名的小丫头，而且她预先垫付的那些钱全都付诸东流，再也不会有机会收回了。

她站在那里喘着粗气，感到自己受到莫大的伤害，就在这个时候，一阵欢声笑语从那间神圣不可侵犯的房间里，从那间特地腾出来开庆祝会的房间里传出来。至少，她现在还可以马上让这吵闹声停下来。

她正要向房门走去，艾米丽亚小姐推开门走了进来，一见她那张气歪了的脸，艾米丽亚小姐惊得后退了一步。

“出了什么事，姐姐？”艾米丽亚小姐诧异地问。

明卿小姐几乎用恶狠狠的口吻回答道：

“萨拉·克鲁在哪里？”

艾米丽亚小姐被问糊涂了。

“萨拉！”她结巴着说，“怎么了，她自然和孩子们在你的屋子里。”

“在她那些华丽的衣服里有没有一件黑色的连衣裙？”——她用的是嘲讽而恶毒的口吻，问。

“黑色连衣裙？”艾米丽亚小姐再次结巴起来，“黑色的？”

“她什么颜色的衣服都有，就是没有黑色的？”

艾米丽亚小姐的脸色发白了。

“没——有，有！”她说，“可她穿起来太短了，她只有一件旧的黑色天鹅绒，她人长高了，不能穿了。”

“去，让她把那件可笑的粉红色丝绸薄纱裙脱下来，换上那件黑的，管它太长还是太短，从今往后她再别指望讲排场了！”

就这样艾米丽亚小姐绞着自己的胖手，哭了起来。

“哦，姐姐！”她呜咽着，“哦，姐姐，倒底是出了什么事？”

明卿小姐倒也说得干脆。

“克鲁上尉死了，”她说，“死后分文也没留下，那个被惯坏了的、娇气的、满脑子胡思乱想的孩子成了由我来管的叫花子了。”

艾米丽亚小姐那胖身子重重地跌坐在离她最近的一张椅子上。

“我在她身上白花了好几百英镑，一文钱也甭想收回，马上让那个荒唐的聚会停下来。马上让她将穿在身上的那件连衣裙换掉。”

“我？”艾米丽亚喘着粗气，问，“我——我非要马上去对她说吗？”

“马上去！”对方恶狠狠地答道，“别像只笨鹅坐在那儿干瞪眼。去！”

可怜的艾米丽亚小姐早已听惯了“笨鹅”的说法。她知道自己是笨，许许多多倒霉的事恰恰是笨鹅干的份儿。进入那间坐满了欢天喜地的孩子的房子里，对庆宴的主人说她眨眼间已成了个小叫花子，并且必须上楼去换上一件破旧且太小的黑色连衣裙，你说干这事儿叫人多难堪。然而，不干也得干，现在很明显不是讨价还价的时候。

她拿出手绢去擦眼睛，擦得满眼通红，然后她站起身出了房间，一句话也不敢多说。每当她的姐姐摆出刚才那个样子、用刚才那种语气说话，最明智的应付办法就是一声不吭，乖乖地听从吩咐。明卿小姐朝教室的另一头走去，大声地自言自语，自己也不知道在干什么。这一年来，有关钻石矿的传闻引得她生出种种发财的设想，只要矿场主愿意帮忙，女子寄宿学校的管理人也能通过投资入股发笔大财。然而现在不但发财无望，却不得不回过头计算自己遭受的损失有多大。

“萨拉公主，哼！”她说，“这孩子被惯得倒像位女王！”

她说着，气冲冲地从屋角的桌子边走过去，突然听见桌布下面有响亮的呜咽声，不禁大吃一惊。

“谁？”她怒喝道，又一阵响亮的呜咽声，她弯下身子揭起了那垂下的桌布。

“你好大胆！”她嚷道，“好大胆！给我出来！”

可怜的贝基，她爬出来，帽子歪在一边，憋红了脸，好不容易忍住才没哭出声来。

“对不起，夫人——是我，夫人，”她辩解道，“我知道不该这么做，可那时我正看洋娃娃，夫人——你进来的时候我吓坏了——只好钻到桌子下面了。”

“你一直在偷听？”明卿小姐问。

“不，夫人，”贝基辩解道，一个劲地行屈膝礼，“不是偷听——我本想在你没有留意的时候悄悄溜出去，可没机会，只好待着。可我没偷听，夫人——我不想听什么，可没法子不听。”

突然间，她似乎一点儿也不怕眼前这位可怕的夫人了，又放声大哭，泪珠儿跟着哗哗流了出来。

“哦，对不起，夫人，”她说，“我怕你准要撵我走了，夫人——可我真为可怜的萨拉小姐难过——真叫人受不了！”

“滚！”明卿小姐喝道。

贝基又行了屈膝礼，泪珠儿如开闸之水哗啦啦顺着脸庞滚了下来。

“是，夫人，我这就走，夫人，”她哆哆嗦嗦，说，“可是，哦，我只想问你一句：萨拉小姐——她一直是位富家小姐，有人侍候，周周到到的，如今连个仆人也没了，夫人，这日子叫她如何过？要是——哦，求你了，要是我干完厨房里所有活儿后去服侍她，好吗？我会很快把活干完——要是你同意我去服侍她，如今她没有了钱，唉。”——贝基又哭了起来——“可怜的萨拉小姐，夫人——原先人家可都管叫她公主啊。”

不知怎么的，明卿小姐听着听着越发生气了，这简直让人无法忍受：就连厨房里干粗活的丫头都站到那孩子一边了——她现在是彻底明白了：自己从来就没有喜欢过这女孩。她被气得直跺脚。

“不行——当然不行，”她说，“她会伺候自己，还要去伺候别人。你给我出去，要不你就用不着干下去了。”

贝基用围裙捂住脸，奔了出去。她离开教室，跑下楼梯，冲进厨房的洗碗间，在那些该她洗的盘盘碗碗当中坐下来，哭着，哭着，心都碎了。

“这跟故事里说的一模一样，”她哭着说，“那些可怜的公主，全都被逐出宫门落难到了民间。”

※

几个钟头之后，萨拉被明卿小姐召了去。只见明卿小姐脸如冰霜，这种严厉冷酷的神情是前所未见的。

就是到了这时候，萨拉还以为，那生日聚会不过是场梦，要不就是多年前曾经发生的事，而且是发生在与她截然不同的另外的女孩身上。

有关聚会的痕迹全都清除干净了：教室墙上的冬青枝被取了下来，长凳和课桌搬回原来的位置上；明卿小姐的起居室也恢复了原来的模样——聚会的痕迹已荡然无存了。明卿小姐也换上了她平时穿的衣服，所有的女孩们接到命令，收起在聚会上所穿的衣裙。做完了这些事之后，她们又回到了教室里，三三两两聚在一起，交头接耳，激动地议论起来。

“让萨拉到我的房间来，”明卿小姐对妹妹说，“告诉她，别在我面前哭哭啼啼，摆出叫人不愉快的模样来。”

“姐姐，”艾米丽亚回答说，“我从来没见过这样古怪的孩子。她居然压根不哭也不闹。你没忘记吧，克鲁上尉回印度的时候她就没哭闹。我把事儿跟她说了，可她只是一动不动地站着，一声不吭，朝我干瞪眼。她的眼睛越瞪越大，脸色发白，一直到我把要说的话说完了，她还是站着呆呆望了好几秒钟，下巴才开始哆嗦起来，转过身飞奔出了屋子，跑上楼。别的孩子倒有几个哭了起来，但是她像是一点儿也没有听到，除了听我说话，她什么反应也没有。真叫人摸不透，她居然没跟我搭腔哩。你告诉人家一些意外的事、奇怪的事，指望听到对方多少回些话吧——不管说的是什么。”

除了萨拉本人，谁也不知道她跑上楼，锁了门，屋子里到底发生了什么事。事实上就连她自己也记不清了，她只记得自己来回走着，一遍一遍地对自己说，可那声音就跟不是她自己的似的：

“爸爸死了！爸爸死了！”

有一次，她在爱米丽面前停下——爱米丽就坐在那张椅子上望着她——没命地哭喊起来：

“爱米丽！你听见了吗？你听到——爸爸已经死了？死在印度——远在千里之外。”

萨拉到了明卿小姐的起居室时，面色苍白，眼圈发黑，嘴唇紧闭，似乎不想让人看出自己受过、现在正在受着多大的痛苦。她已经不再是那个粉红色蝴蝶般的女孩了，想当初，在布置得漂漂亮亮的教室里，她在那些属于自己的宝贝中来回穿梭，可现在，她成了个陌生、悲惨并且有些古怪的小孩儿。

她没有让玛丽埃塔帮忙，自己动手穿上那件已经长久扔在一边的黑天鹅绒连衣裙。衣服太短太小了，一双细腿露在过短的裙下，显得又瘦又长。由于找不到一条黑色的发带，她厚密的黑油油的短发松散地在脸旁垂下来，与苍白的脸色形成鲜明的对照。她用一只手紧紧抱住爱米丽，爱米丽身上也裹着一块黑料子。

“把你的洋娃娃放下，”明卿小姐说，“你带着它到这儿来干吗？”

“不，”萨拉答道，“我不想放下，我只有她一个了，她是我爸爸留给我的。”

她时常惹得明卿小姐私底里感到不快，如今又是这样。她说话语调并不粗鲁，却是冷冰冰的，显得很坚定，令明卿小姐觉得不好对付——也许明卿小姐心里明白：自己在做的是件冷酷和没有人性的事。

“以后你不会有时间摆弄洋娃娃了，”她说，“你得干活，改变自己，做个有用的人。”

萨拉用她那古怪的大眼睛瞪着她，一声不吭。

“如今情况全变了，”明卿小姐接着说，“我想艾米丽亚小姐已经把话都说清楚了。”

“是的，”萨拉回答说，“我爸爸死了。他没能留给我钱。我非常穷。”

“你穷得像个叫花子，”明卿小姐说，一想起这话意味着什么，她又来气了，“你没个亲人，没个住处，没人养你了。”

那瘦弱苍白的小脸蛋抽搐了一会儿，但她仍旧一声不吭。

“你干瞪什么眼？”明卿小姐斥责道，“你不会蠢得连话都不会听了吧？对你说吧，在这世上你孤孤单单的一个人，不会再有人帮你，除非我出于好心收留下你。”

“我明白了，”萨拉答道，说得很轻，用的是另一种声音，如同强吞下了堵在喉咙口的什么东西，“我明白了。”

“那洋娃娃，”明卿小姐嚷着，手指着那个放在附近座位上漂亮惹眼的生日礼物，“怪模怪样的洋娃娃，还有她那一大堆不中用的奢侈品——全是花我的钱买来的！”

萨拉转身对着椅子。

“最后的洋娃娃，”她说，“最后的洋娃娃。”她声音细嫩、哀伤，听来很是奇异。

“最后的洋娃娃，没错！”明卿小姐说，“但那是我的，不是你的，你的一切都归我了。”

“好吧，那就拿走吧，”萨拉说，“我不想要了。”

要是这时候萨拉哭哭啼啼，战战兢兢，显出害怕的模样，明卿小姐说不定会对她有一些耐心。她是个喜欢操纵他人、喜欢弄权的女人，可是她见到的萨拉那苍白、坚毅的小脸，听到的是傲慢、细嫩的声音，只觉得自己的权威受到了蔑视。

“别再神气十足了，”她说，“那种日子已经过去，你再也不是公主，你的马车和矮种马没了——仆人也得打发走。你要穿上最破旧、最普通的衣服——你的身份已经不再适合穿豪华的服装了。你与贝基一样——想活下去就得干活。”

令明卿小姐感到震惊的是，这女孩的眼里闪出一丝微微的亮光——宽慰的亮光。

“要我干活吗？”她说，“只要让我干活，我就放心了，可我能干什么呢？”

“让你干什么就干什么，”她听到这样的回答，“你不笨，很容易学会。要是成个有用的人，我会把你留在这儿。你法语说得不错，可以帮助那些小女孩。”

“我行吗？”萨拉高兴地道，“噢，请让我做吧！我可以教她们，我喜欢她们，她们也喜欢我。”

“喜欢你，别胡扯了！”明卿小姐说，“除了教那些小姑娘，你还要干很多别的事，你跑腿当杂差，下厨房里帮工，打扫教室。要是干得不称我的心，给我走人。这些话记清楚了。现在你可以走了。”

萨拉望着她，一动不动地站了一小会儿。她幼小的脑子里转着深奥而奇特的想法，然后她转身要走了。

“站住！”明卿小姐说，“你不打算感谢我吗？”

萨拉停下脚步，那些深奥而奇特的想法一下子涌上心头。

“为什么？”她说。

“因为我对你仁慈，”明卿小姐答道，“我出于仁慈让你有个家。”

萨拉向她走近两三步，瘦小的胸口起伏着，用一种奇特的严厉语调说，不像出自孩子之口。

“你一点也不仁慈！”她说，“你一点也不仁慈，这里根本不能算是家！”她说完转身奔出房间，明卿小姐来不及叫住她，或作出别的反应，只能呆呆地、愤怒地瞪着她离去的身影。

萨拉缓缓地走上楼梯，喘着粗气，紧紧地把爱米丽抱在胸前。

“真希望她能说话，”她自言自语道，“要是她能说话该有多好啊——要是她能说话该有多好啊！”

她打算回自己的房里，在虎皮上躺一会儿，脸颊贴在那只“大猫”的头上，对着炉火好好儿理理思绪，那该多好啊！可是她刚刚踏上楼梯的平台，艾米丽亚小姐从里面走了出来，反手关上房门，站在门口，显得又尴尬又不安。可不是吗，让她去干这种事使她感到好不羞愧。

“你——你不可以进去。”她说。

“不可以进去？”萨拉后退了一步，喊叫道。

“现在那房间不归你了。”艾米丽亚小姐答道，脸色有点发红。

不知怎么的，萨拉猛然间全清楚了，明卿小姐不是说过“情况变了”吗，“变化”真的开始了。

“哪是我的房间？”她问，但愿自己的声音没发颤。

“你得去阁楼，挨着贝基的那间。”

萨拉知道那房间在哪里。贝基对她提到过。她转过身，上了两段楼梯。最后一段楼梯十分窄，铺着破旧得成了丝丝缕缕的旧地毯。她觉得似乎正在远离这个世界，把另一个女孩生活过的世界留在了身后，那女孩已经不再是她自己了。此时的这个女孩身上穿的是短而紧的旧连衣裙，正朝着阁楼爬，完全换了一个人了。

她在阁楼门口打开门的时候，她的心悲伤得不由一阵悸动。她关上门，靠着门张望四周。

是的，这是另外一个世界。房间的天花板是倾斜的，虽然刷过石灰，已肮脏不堪了，很多地方灰泥都已脱落。壁炉倒有一个，但已锈迹斑斑，一张旧铁床，一条褪了色的床罩铺在硬床板上。几件家具，是楼下用过、太破太旧才被送上来的。从屋顶的天窗望出去，只有一长条灰蒙蒙的天空，其他什么都见不到，天窗下放着一条破旧不堪的红色矮凳。萨拉走过去，坐了下来。她一向不爱哭，这时也没哭。她让爱米丽横躺在膝盖上，低下头，脸偎依着她，手臂环抱着她，一直这样坐着，长着乌发的小脑袋靠在黑色的布帘上，不发一言，不吭一声。

她就这样静静地坐着，突然从门口传来了一声轻微的敲门声——这声音非常轻，怯生生的，一开始她没能听见，后来那门被微微推开，一张可怜巴巴、满是泪水的脏脸露了进来，她才看清，那是贝基。贝基已经私底下独自哭了好几个钟头了，一直在用她那块厨房干活用的围裙擦着眼睛，结果把自己抹成了大花脸，让人认不出来了。

“噢，小姐，”她小声说，“我可以——你同意我——进来一会儿吗？”

萨拉抬起头来，看着她，想笑笑，可是怎么也笑不出来。突然——这全是因为见到了贝基泪眼中所流露出的关爱和忧伤神情——她的脸上重新出现了一丝孩子气，而不再是那种少年老成的神态了。她向贝基伸出手，轻轻呜咽了一声。

“噢，贝基，”她说，“我早就对你说过，咱俩都一样——只不过是两个小姑娘——两个小姑娘而已。你看，不是被我说对了吗！如今再没有区别了，我已经不是公主了。”

贝基奔过去，握住她的手，紧紧抱在胸前。她跪在她的身旁，既心疼又悲伤地哭着。

“还是公主，小姐，你就是公主，”她边哭边说，说得断断续续，“不管你遇到了什么事——不管什么事——你还是公主——什么也改变不了你！”





八　阁楼里


萨拉永远也忘不了在阁楼里度过的第一个晚上。这漫漫长夜，她是在一种不是一个孩子所能够承受的强烈悲伤和痛苦中度过的。这种痛苦，她对周围的所有的人都不曾提及。谁也理解不了。她躺在黑暗里，没有睡，陌生的环境迫使她分心，说来这确有好处。她小小的身躯还能意识到物质性的东西，不然的话，她幼小心灵绝经受不了这种巨大的痛楚，而事实上这天夜里她似乎没有感觉到自己的存在，只有—件事，此外没有别的事，令她念念不忘。

“我爸爸死了，”她一直喃喃道，“我爸爸死了！”

过了很久，她才意识到那床太硬了，翻来覆去怎么也找不到睡得舒服的地方；这才感到房里笼罩着从未经受过浓重的黑暗，风在房顶上的烟囱间呼啸，就像是有谁在大声哭号。然而更糟的是，墙壁里和踢脚板后传出莫名的打闹声、抓挠声和吱吱的尖叫声，她知道那是什么东西在作怪，因为贝基曾告诉过她。是大、小耗子，它们在打架，在吵闹。有一两次，她几乎可以听到尖尖的脚趾在地板上跑过的声音。在后来的日子里，她始终忘不了，当时听到这样的声音，惊惶中从床上跳起来，坐在那里浑身发抖，后来再躺下，用被子把脑袋蒙了起来。

她生命里的变故不是渐渐发生的，而是一下子突然降临的。

“她要活下去，就得开始干活。”明卿小姐对艾米丽亚小姐说，“应该马上告诉她，她指望得到的是什么。”

第二天一早玛丽埃塔就走了。萨拉走过自己原先的房间时，门正开着，她朝屋里看了一眼，里面全变了样。她的一些饰品和华丽的衣物全被取走，角落里放了一张床，这里已经换作另一个新生的卧房了。

她到楼下吃饭，看见明卿小姐身边的那个座位已经让拉维尼亚坐了，明卿小姐说话的态度也很冷淡。

“你要开始履行新的职责了，萨拉，”她说，“小桌子那边有你的座位，和年龄小一点的孩子们在一起。你必须让她们保持安静，而且一定要令她们守规矩，不许浪费食物。你早就应该下楼来了，洛蒂都把茶水打翻了。”

这只是个开端，以后交给她的活儿会越来越多。她得教幼小孩子学法语，辅导她们别的功课，这些是她起码要干的活儿。学校里方方面面的事都用得着她。不管什么时候，也不管什么天气，都可以打发她出去跑腿、干杂务。别人没注意到而没有完成的事可以差她做，厨娘与仆人们都学着明卿小姐的腔调，争着对这个“小东西”吆五喝六。你看她过去不是长期被捧上天了吗？她们可不是高素质的仆人，既不懂礼貌，也没有好脾气，一旦自己做错了事，找个替罪羊，那不是很方便吗？

开头一两个月里，萨拉想，她愿意努力把这些事情做好，挨了骂也不做声，也许能够使那些拼命驱使她的人心肠变软些吧。在她那高傲的幼小心灵中，她决心要让他们知道她是在努力做到自食其力，决不是靠其他人的施舍。可是有一天她终于看明白了，这些人的心肠绝对软化不了；她越是诚心诚意按她们的吩咐好好去做，那些缺乏同情心的仆人就越发盛气凌人，要求也更加苛刻，那个喜欢骂人的厨娘就越发乱骂人了。

假如她年纪再大点，明卿小姐早就叫她去教大些的女孩了，这样就能够辞掉一位女教师节省开支；可是她既然依旧是个小孩子，倒不如让她当个高级小杂工、样样活都要干的女佣，作用更大。普通干杂活的男童不会有她那样聪明可靠。一些困难的任务、传递复杂的口信可以放心交萨拉去办，她甚至还可以外出按账单付款，此外还可以打扫房间，整理东西。

现在再也谈不到她自己的学业了，什么都不让她学，她整天价被人使来唤去，跑前跑后，忙忙碌碌劳累了一天之后才勉强同意她夜里守着一大堆旧书，在冷冷清清的教室里，自个儿用功。

“假如那些已经学过的东西我不去复习，准会忘得精光，”她暗自说道，“我几乎变成厨房里干杂活的丫头了，要是我是个无知无识的厨房丫头，跟可怜的贝基还有什么不同呢。我担心我是不是把学到的东西全都忘了，说起话来满口的土腔，记不得亨利八世有六位妻子。”

在萨拉的新生活中，有一件非常稀奇的事：她在学生中的地位变了，她再也不是她们当中的小贵族，甚至再也不是她们当中的一员了。她听人差遣，有没完没了的活要干，哪有机会与她们说话，而且她肯定看得出，明卿小姐巴不得她与学生们断绝往来。

“我可不让她与别的孩子来往亲密，也不许她与她们讲话，”明卿小姐说，“女孩子喜欢发牢骚，如果她把自己那些编造出来的荒唐事讲给她们听，她就会成为她们心目中受虐待的女英雄了，这会给孩子的家长们留下错误的印象。因此最好不让她与她们来往——让她去过与自己处境相应的生活。我已经给她一个家了，她还有什么权利指望从我这里得到别的呢？”

萨拉没有太多的期望，她心高气傲，有些女孩子，见了她显得很尴尬，拿不定主意要不要与她交往，对这些人萨拉并不想保持与她们的往来。明卿小姐的学生实际上都是群愚蠢的普通小姑娘。她们过惯了富足和舒服的日子，然而萨拉所穿的衣服却看上去越来越短，越来越破，模样显得更古怪了。她穿着的鞋子有了破洞，她被差到街上去购买厨娘急需的食物，手臂上挎着一只篮子，这些都是事实，于是那些学生在与萨拉说话的时候，免不了露出在与下等女佣说话的口气来。

“她过去还是个拥有钻石矿的姑娘哩，”拉维尼亚发起了议论，“想不到如今成了这副模样。她变得越发古怪了。我一直就不那么喜欢她，可是她现在见了人一声不吭的样子真让我受不了——好像是把你看穿似的。”

“我就是这个样，”萨拉听了以后立刻说，“我就是抱着这种目的看某些人的。我想了解她们，然后还要反复琢磨琢磨哩。”

实际上她有好几次就是依靠多看了拉维尼亚几眼才避免了不少的麻烦，因为拉维尼亚喜欢搞恶作剧，要是可以把这位从前的“示范生”捉弄一下，那才开心哩。

萨拉自己从来不寻衅闹事，也不惹是生非。她成天像苦力一样埋头干活：她拎着一包包一篮篮东西来往于湿漉漉的街道上；煞费苦心地教好那些不认真听课的小家伙法语。她身上的衣衫越发破烂，模样日渐凄惨，人们干脆让她待在楼下吃饭，在他们眼中她是个无人疼的孤儿，她的内心变得越发孤傲和痛苦，但她从不对人吐露自己的感受。

“军人是不会抱怨叫屈的，”她紧咬自己的小牙关，说道，“我也不想抱怨叫屈，我要把这假设成是在打仗。”

但也有时候，她幼小的心灵似乎要被孤独折磨碎了，幸好还有三个人能够安慰她。

第一个自然是贝基——不是贝基还有谁呢？在阁楼里度过的第一个晚上，一想到在那个有耗子打闹尖叫的墙的另一面还有着一个人，她便隐隐约约地感到安慰。在此后的几个晚上，这样的安慰感渐渐明显了。她俩白天很少有讲话的时间，各自有各自的活要干，要想交谈就会被以为是偷懒与磨洋工。

“要是我没说一些客气话，别怪我，小姐，”第一天的清晨贝基就悄悄对她说，“要是我装得斯斯文文的，就会有人来找咱们的茬。我指的是没说‘请’呀、‘谢谢您’呀、‘请原谅’一类的客套话，可我哪有时间去说？”

可是趁天还未亮，她时常溜到萨拉的小房间里，替她扣扣子，帮萨拉做些需要的事，这才下楼去厨房生火。到了夜里，萨拉总是可以听到房门响起小心翼翼的敲门声，这表示假如她需要，这个贴身女仆就会前来帮她一把。最初的几个星期，极度悲伤的萨拉觉得脑子空空的，连话也不想说，因此过了好一段时间她们才时常见面，相互探望。贝基心里明白，在别人痛苦时最好别去打扰。

第二个来安慰萨拉的是埃芒加德。可是在她拿不准应该如何安慰之前出了件奇事。

在萨拉的心灵渐渐从痛苦中苏醒过来，重新关注起周围的环境的时候，她发现自己似乎忘了世上还有一个埃芒加德存在。她俩一直都是好朋友，但萨拉总是觉得自己年纪比她大了好多。无可否认，埃芒加德脑子非常不好使，同时又非常重感情。她对萨拉的依恋很单纯而富有依赖性；她把功课带来，让萨拉帮她；她认真听萨拉说话，缠着她让她讲故事。可是她自己讲不出多少有意思的话，她厌恶所有的书籍。有人遭灾遇祸时，往往都不会想到有她这个人的，因此萨拉忘了她。

巧的是埃芒加德几个星期前突然被接回家去了，因此也就更容易忘记她了。她回来之后，头一两天没见到萨拉。她第一次遇见萨拉时，刚好萨拉从走廊过来，手里抱着一大堆衣服要送到楼下缝补——萨拉已学会了缝补衣服。她的脸色显得苍白，完全变了个人似的，而且身上穿了件怪模怪样、小而不合身的连衣裙，短得露出了一大截黑糊糊的细腿。

埃芒加德是个十分迟钝的女孩，面对这场面一时反应不过来，压根想不出该说些什么。她知道出事了，但是无论如何也想不到萨拉会变成这个模样——那样的古怪、可怜，简直是个不折不扣的女仆了。这让她觉得很难过，可又不知如何是好，居然猛可里发出一阵简短的歇斯底里的笑声，并且喊了起来——不知不觉，好像也没有意思：

“噢，萨拉！是你吗？”

“是我。”萨拉回答，忽然脑海中闪过一个奇怪的想法，不觉地涨红了脸。

她双手抱着那些衣服，用下巴顶着，以免倒下来。她直勾勾地瞪着人，这令埃芒加德越发不知所措了。她感觉到萨拉变成另一个人了，变成了她不认识的女孩。也许这是因为萨拉一下子变穷，跟贝基那样，得去缝补衣物、干粗活。

“哦，”埃芒加德结巴着说，“你——你好吗？”

“我说不准，”萨拉答道，“你呢？”

“我——我挺好，”埃芒加德说，她羞愧得一时不知如何是好，后来，她一下子想起来该说些更为亲切的话，“你——很不幸，对吗？”她脱口说了这么一句。

萨拉只觉得受了很大的委屈，她的心原已受到深深的伤害，这时油然生发出一股强烈的自尊心。她感到若是有人如此愚蠢，不如远离她的好。

“你看呢，”她说，“你觉得我会非常幸福吗？”说罢她大踏步从对方身边走了过去，再也没说一句话。

过了一小段时间之后，萨拉渐渐意识到，是自己悲惨的遭遇令她昏了头脑，不然的话，她定会理解，这个可怜、迟钝的埃芒加德只是笨嘴笨舌，反应不机灵，是不该怪罪她的。埃芒加德向来就不机灵，她越觉得自己不行就越发笨拙。

可是刚才突然闪现在萨拉脑海中的那个念头，使她变得多疑起来。

“她跟别的孩子一样，”萨拉想道，“她不是真的想与我说话，她知道别人都不愿意跟我说话。”

随后一连好几个星期，她俩之间像是竖起了一堵墙。每当她俩偶尔相遇，萨拉就别过脸去，埃芒加德则感到手足无措，说不出话来。有时她俩相互点个头就过去了，有些时候甚至连招呼都不打。

“要是她不愿与我说话，”萨拉想，“那我就避开她，有了明卿小姐那套办法，避开她不是挺容易的吗？”

明卿小姐的办法是很灵，后来她俩连面也见不上了。那些日子，人们发现埃芒加德显得比从前更笨头笨脑了，成天没精打采、闷闷不乐。她时常在窗台上一坐，身子蜷成一团，一声不吭地呆望着窗外。有一次，杰西正走过，停下来好奇地打量她。

“你干吗哭鼻子，埃芒加德？”她问道。

“我没有哭。”埃芒加德闷声闷气地答道，声音有些颤抖。

“还没哭哩，”杰西说，“你瞧一大滴泪珠儿顺着鼻梁从鼻尖上掉下来。瞧，又有一滴。”

“唉，”埃芒加德说，“我心里可难受了——别来烦人。”她扭过胖胖的脊背，拿出手帕，干脆蒙住了脸。

那天晚上，萨拉回阁楼比平时要晚些。让她干的活儿一件接一件，老干不完，到了学生们回房睡了之后，她才得空去那冷清清的教室里学习。她到了楼梯口，发现阁楼门底下透出一丝微光，觉得好生奇怪。

“除了我没人会到这儿来，”她想道，“可是怎么会点上蜡烛呢。”

确实有人点了蜡烛，那不是她常用的、厨房烛台点剩下的烛头，而是学生卧房里用的蜡烛。有个人坐在那旧矮凳上，穿着睡衣，裹着红披肩。是埃芒加德。

“埃芒加德！”萨拉大吃一惊，吓得喊出声来，“你这会惹上麻烦的。”

埃芒加德晃晃悠悠地从矮凳上站起来。她穿了双卧房穿的、嫌大的拖鞋迎了过去，她的眼睛与鼻子都哭红了。

“这我知道——要是被发现，”她说，“可我不在乎——才不在乎哩。噢，萨拉，你就跟我说吧，到底怎么回事？你干吗不喜欢我了？”

一听她这么说，萨拉喉咙里又出现一块熟悉的东西令她再次感到哽咽，对方的声调多真挚，多纯真——原先那个要求成为萨拉“最好的朋友”的埃芒加德用的就是这样的声调。这说明在过去的几个星期中，这小姑娘的作为并非是她本意的表现。

“我是喜欢你的，”萨拉回答道，“我以为——你知道，现在跟过去不同，情况完全变了。我以为你——也变了。”

埃芒加德瞪大了她的那双泪眼。

“不是吗，是你全变了！”她嚷道，“是你不愿跟我说话，我没辙了。是你，在我回来以后，全变了。”

萨拉想了一会儿，她知道自己错了。

“我是变了，”她解释道，“不过跟你想的不一样。明卿小姐不希望我跟姑娘们说话，她们大多数的人也不愿意跟我说话。我以为——说不定——你也不愿意，所以我尽量躲开你。”

“哦，萨拉！”埃芒加德又气又恼，难过得差点没哭出来。随后彼此对望了一眼，奔过去搂在一起。应该承认，萨拉那满头黑发的小脑袋在那个披着红披肩的肩膀上伏了好几分钟。想当初她以为埃芒加德抛弃她了，那时她感到多么孤独啊。

后来她俩一起在地板上坐下来，萨拉双手抱着膝盖，埃芒加德裹紧披肩，怀着深深崇拜之意打量萨拉那长着一双大眼睛的、奇特的小面孔。

“我再也受不了了，”她说，“我敢说，没有我你能活下去，萨拉；可我，没有你我可活不了，我似乎要死掉了。所以今天晚上我蒙着被子哭呀哭，突然想到应该悄悄到你这里来，只求你让我们再做好朋友。”

“你比我善良，”萨拉说，“我太骄傲了，没有做出努力再与你交朋友。你看，如今面临着种种考验，结果说明我不是好孩子，我以前就担心结果会是这样，没准”——聪慧的姑娘皱起了眉头——“这些考验就是冲着这个来的。”

“我不明白这样的考验有什么好处。”埃芒加德口气坚定地说。

“我也不明白——我说的是真心话，”萨拉坦诚地承认，“可我以为没准是有好处的，只是咱们还看不出。没准——”她迟疑道，“明卿小姐也有她好的地方。”

埃芒加德看了一眼阁楼，有点害怕，又觉得好奇。

“萨拉，”她说，“你待在这种地方受得了吗？”

萨拉也打量了一眼四周的环境。

“要是我假设这是个完全不同的地方，我就受得了，”她回答道，“没准，在我的想象中这是故事里的一个地方。”

她慢慢地说着。她的想象力又开始活跃起来。自从她遭到种种苦难以来，她似乎没有动用过想象力，她感到想象力似乎被吓昏了。

“有的人生活在更加恶劣的环境里。想想关在伊夫城堡地牢里的基督山伯爵，想想被囚禁在巴士底监狱里的那些人吧！”

“巴士底监狱。”埃芒加德悄声嘀咕道，眼望着她，开始听得入迷了。她想起有关法国大革命的故事，那全是萨拉有声有色的讲述才在她心中留下深深的印象。除了萨拉，没有人可以做到。

萨拉的双眸中又闪出大家所熟悉的光芒来。

“是呀，”她说，抱紧双膝，“那是一个用来‘假设’的好地方。我就是巴士底监狱中的一个囚犯。在这儿关了一年又一年——已经好多年了，每个人都不记得我了。明卿小姐就是监狱的看守——那么贝基，”突然间她眼睛一亮，“她是隔壁牢房里的又一名囚犯。”

她转过脸来，面对着埃芒加德，又变回当初的那个萨拉了。

“我就要这样假设，”她说，“这对我是一大慰藉。”

埃芒加德高兴起来，同时也感到敬畏。

“你愿意全都跟我说吗？”她问，“夜里，只要安全的时候，我就会悄悄到你这里来，听你说在白天就编好了的故事，好吗？那样咱俩就成了比‘最好的朋友’更好的朋友了。”

“好，”萨拉点头答应，“患难见真情，正是我的患难考验了你，证明你是个多好的人。”





九　梅基塞代克


第三个来安慰萨拉的是洛蒂。她这个小不丁点儿压根就不懂逆境是啥滋味儿，想不通自己的“代理妈妈”怎么变化这么大。她听人说萨拉出了怪事儿，可她就是不明白为什么居然连模样都变了——怎么身上穿着的是陈旧的黑色连衣裙，进了教室不坐在自己的“荣誉席”上听课，倒是教起课来了。年幼的小姑娘们发现萨拉再也不住在爱米丽煞有介事地端坐在内的房间里了，便交头接耳地议论开来。最让洛蒂无法理解的是，当别人问萨拉什么事时，她总是话不多说，三言两语了事。一个七岁的小孩要懂得这些神秘的事，非要有人给她说得明明白白不可。

“萨拉，你现在是不是很穷了？”在洛蒂的这个朋友第一次教小家伙们法语课的那天早晨，她悄悄地问道，“你跟叫花子一样穷吗？”她那胖乎乎的手塞到萨拉瘦瘦的手里，一双噙着泪珠儿的眼睛睁得圆圆的，“我可不要你跟叫花子一样穷。”

瞧她这就要哭出来了，萨拉便立刻抚慰她。

“乞丐连住的地方都没有，”萨拉鼓起勇气说，“可我有。”

“那你住哪里？”洛蒂追问道，“你的房间都让新来的女孩占了，现在那儿也不漂亮了。”

“我住在别的房间里。”萨拉说。

“那个房间好不好？”洛蒂问，“我想看看去。”

“你快别说话了，”萨拉说，“明卿小姐正往我们这儿瞧呢，她见我跟你说悄悄话，会对我生气的。”

萨拉早已发现，只要课堂上出了什么岔子那全都要怪罪自己。孩子们不认真听课啦，交头接耳啦，她们不安分啦，也都要说是她的不是。

洛蒂可是个死心眼的小姑娘，萨拉没有告诉她住在哪，她就要变着法儿找到。她先是问小伙伴们，随后听岁数大些的姑娘们聊天，根据她们的言谈中无意透露出的信息采取了行动。一天黄昏，她开始寻访起来。她爬上了从未爬过的一段楼梯，到了阁楼的顶层。她看到两扇紧挨在一起的门，打开其中一扇，便见她那亲爱的萨拉站在一张破旧的桌上，眼望着窗外。

“萨拉！”她吃惊得嚷了起来，“萨拉妈妈！”她吃惊，是因为阁楼空荡荡的，糟透了，好像离这个世界好远好远。她那双短腿像是爬过好几百个梯级才到了这儿。

萨拉听见她的声音，回过身，这下可把她惊呆了，该怎么办呢？要是洛蒂嚷嚷起来，让人听见，她俩可就遭殃了。她从桌子上跳下来，奔了过去。

“别嚷嚷，别出声，”她哀求道，“要不我会挨骂的，这一整天我已挨够了骂。这里——这个屋子也不是太糟，洛蒂。”

“不糟？”洛蒂喘着粗气，咬紧嘴唇，朝四周打量了一下。如今她还是个任性的孩子，只是她深深爱着自己的“代理妈妈”，她才使劲克制住了自己。就是说，只要是萨拉住的地方，不管好的、歹的，都应该是个好地方。“怎么就不糟，萨拉？”她悄声问道。

萨拉紧紧搂住她，尽量挤出点笑容来。这稚嫩的、胖乎乎的身躯暖烘烘的，让人感觉到慰藉，不是吗？她度过了艰难的一天，刚才她正含着热泪望着窗外。

“从这里你可以看到许许多多的东西，在楼下是看不到的。”她说。

“那是什么？”洛蒂好奇地问。就是年纪大些的女孩子，萨拉也有办法挑起她们的好奇心。

“烟囱——离我们很近很近——冒出来的烟像花环和云雾，飘向天空——麻雀也在那儿蹦蹦跳跳，叽叽喳喳，跟人一样说个没完——还有别的阁楼的天窗，随时都会冷不丁地伸出一个人的头来，你就猜啦：那是谁的脑袋。你感觉自己站得老高老高——像是在另—个世界。”

“噢，我也要看看，”洛蒂嚷了起来，“抱我上去！”

萨拉抱她上去，她俩都在那张旧桌子上站着，靠着屋顶扁平天窗的边上眺望起来。

没有亲临其境像那样眺望过的人，不会知道她俩看到的是多么与众不同的世界：两边一块块石板瓦斜着向下延伸，直达雨天用来排水的水槽，麻雀在那里大胆地叫着，跳着，自由自在。有两只停在近处的烟囱上，起劲地争个不休，一只把另一只啄跑才罢休。隔壁阁楼的那扇窗子紧闭着，因为那是栋无人居住的房子。

“我真希望那里有人住，”萨拉说，“离得近近的，要是也有个小女孩住在那阁楼里，我们就能够探出头来说话了，只要有胆量，不怕掉下去，还能爬过去串串门。”

天空看起来比在大街上离人近多了，这令洛蒂很着迷。从阁楼窗子穿过烟囱管望过去，下面世界发生的事情似乎显得不那么真实。一时间她忘了明卿小姐、艾米丽亚小姐以及学校的存在，广场上隆隆的车轮声也好像是属于另外一个世界。

“哦，萨拉！”洛蒂依偎在萨拉护着自己的臂弯里，高声道，“我喜欢这个阁楼——我喜欢！这里比楼下好！”

“你看那只麻雀，”萨拉小声说，“要是扔给他一些面包屑就好了。”

“我有！”洛蒂尖声抢着说，“我口袋里有一小块圆面包，是昨天我用自己的钱买来的，我留下了一些。”

可是她们刚扔出一些面包屑，那只麻雀就跳开去，飞到邻近的烟囱顶上去了。它看上去并不习惯与阁楼里的人亲近，突如其来的面包屑吓了它一跳。这时候洛蒂倒是安安分分的，不吵也不闹，萨拉学着小鸟，发出轻柔的啾啾声——似乎她就是—只麻雀——那只麻雀看清楚了刚才让它吓了一跳的东西，那居然是要好好款待自己的。它把头一偏，眨巴着眼睛，待在烟囱顶上向下盯着面包屑。这下洛蒂来劲了。

“它会过来吗？会过来吗？”她小声问。

“瞧他的眼神，几乎要过来的，”萨拉也小声回答道，“他正在反复寻思该不该过来呢。是的，他定会过来！瞧，他不是过来了吗？”

那只麻雀飞过来，朝面包屑跳了过来，然后在只有几英寸的距离外停住了，又把头侧向一边，似乎捉摸着萨拉和洛蒂是不是会一下子变成两只大猫，朝它扑过来。随后它的小心眼儿对它说，她们的样子是很和气的，然后它跳近了一些，又近了一些，快速地朝着那块最大的冲去，猛地—啄，衔住面包屑，飞向烟囱的另—侧。

“现在他明白了，”萨拉说，“他不会放过另外的面包屑了。”

那只麻雀果然飞回来了，还带来一个朋友，朋友飞开去，回来时又带了一个亲戚，它们一起美美地饱餐—顿，叽叽喳喳叫唤着，还时不时停下来，头一偏，打量洛蒂和萨拉哩。洛蒂高兴不已，把最初阁楼让她胆战心惊的情景抛到九霄云外了。事实上，当她从桌子上被抱回到原先的现实中，萨拉可以给她指出室内的许多美好的地方，那是她自己发现不了的。

“这样小的阁楼，高高在上，”萨拉说，“好像是树上的鸟窝，瞧这倾斜的天花板多好玩！你瞧，屋子这边低得你差不多不能站直，清晨的阳光照进来，我就能在床上躺着，透过房顶扁平的窗子直接看到天空。天空像是块四四方方的亮光。太阳快出来的时候，有块粉红色的小云朵在空中飘浮，我感到似乎可以触摸到它们。要是下雨呢，滴答滴答的雨点儿，好像在讲一些美妙的故事。还有，要是晚上有星星，你能躺着数数，有多少颗落进方窗里。方窗里能容纳不少星星哩！再瞧墙角边生锈的小壁炉。要是擦亮它，生上火，你想象一下那该是多么奇妙呀！不是吗，这小房间可真美哩。”

她握住洛蒂的手，在这小小的房间里走了一圈，打着手势，来描述自己想象出来的种种美景，她说得洛蒂像是真的看到了。洛蒂对萨拉所描述的图景深信不疑。

“你瞧，”萨拉说，“这地板上可以铺上又厚又软的蓝印度地毯，墙角可以摆一只柔软的小沙发，再放几个软垫，你就可以蜷起身子，靠在上面休息。沙发的正上方可以安个书架，放满书，一伸手就能取到。壁炉前铺一块毛地毯，墙上挂上帷帘，把白灰遮住，还可以挂些图画，一定要小小的，当然得画得很美丽，还要有盏灯，灯罩是深玫瑰色的，屋中央放着一张桌子，放上茶具。炉架上吊着圆鼓鼓的铜制小壶滋滋地唱着歌儿。床铺也要变变，换成很软的那种，铺上一条惹人爱的真丝床罩，看上去就很美了。或许我们可以继续喂那些麻雀，和他们交朋友，这样他们就飞过来啄着窗子，想要进来。”

“噢，萨拉！”洛蒂喊起来，“我太愿意在这里待下去了！”

萨拉好不容易劝她下楼，打发走了她，自己回到阁楼里，站在房子中央环顾周围。她为洛蒂所想象出来的那些图景已消失殆尽。床铺还是那么硬，铺着的床单又脏又破。墙壁上露出掉了灰泥的斑驳黑块，地板冰冷冰冷的，没有地毯，壁炉的铁栅栏已断裂且锈迹斑斑，那矮凳的一条腿已破损，倒向一边，它是屋子里唯一可以坐坐的地方。她在上面坐了几分钟，低头伏在双手上。洛蒂来了又走了，这反而使情况变得更糟糕——好像是探监的人来了又走了，坐牢的人感到分外寂寞凄凉。

“一个孤寂的地方，”她说，“有时令人感到是这世上最最孤寂的地方。”

她坐着，坐着，猛听到附近有一丝很细微的声音，引起了她的注意。她抬起头来，想看看是哪里来的，假如她是个神经质的女孩，就会急忙离开旧矮凳。原来地上有一只大老鼠正用后腿蹲着，饶有兴趣地嗅着空气中的气味。洛蒂掉在地板上一些面包屑，是那香味引得老鼠从洞里爬出来。

它显得异常古怪，活脱脱像个留着灰胡须的小矮人或小精灵，萨拉看着，看着，禁不住着迷了。它亮闪闪的眼睛打量她，像是在问她似的，显得那样的迷惑不解，萨拉这孩子的脑海中浮现出一个稀奇古怪的想法。

“我敢肯定，做只老鼠也挺艰难，”她想道，“没有人喜爱你。人们看到你会跳起来逃开，大呼小叫起来：‘啊，多吓人的老鼠！’我可不会喜欢人们一见到我就跳起来逃开，大呼小叫：‘啊，多吓人的萨拉！’而且设下捕捉我的夹子，用装作好吃的东西让我上钩。麻雀可就完全不同了！可是老鼠在出生前，没人会问他愿不愿意做老鼠，没有人会说：‘你难道不想做一只麻雀吗？’”

她坐着，一动不动。老鼠的胆子也壮了。老鼠当然怕她，可是也许它也像那麻雀一样，心想：萨拉会不会是个会猛扑过来的东西？它饿极了，在墙壁中还有老婆孩子一大家子，这些天以来它们的运气确实坏透了。它出洞时，小耗子还在拼命哭闹哩，觉得为了这些面包屑冒再大的风险也在所不惜，于是它小心翼翼地放下前脚。

“过来吧，”萨拉说，“我可不是老鼠夹子，面包屑你就叼走吧，可怜的家伙！巴士底监狱的囚犯都会与老鼠交朋友的，你我做个朋友，好吗？”

动物是如何了解事物的，这我不清楚，不过它们一定是会理解的。也许有一种语言不用字写出来，也不用说出来，却是世间万物都会理解的。也许万物中无不藏匿着一个灵魂，即使不发出一丝一毫的声音，也始终能和另一个灵魂对话。总之，不管是什么原因，反正那只老鼠已明白自己是安全的——即使它只是一只老鼠。它明白这个坐在红色的小矮凳上的女孩是不会跳起来，发了疯似的，尖声怪叫起来，吓走它，也不会向它扔很重的东西。碰到那些重玩意儿，就算没有把它砸烂，也会让它拐着腿狼狈地逃回洞里去的。它可真算得上是只好老鼠，丝毫不想干坏事。在它用后腿站在那儿嗅着空气、一双亮闪闪的眼睛注视着萨拉时，它渴望她能够理解这种情况，一开始就不把它当敌人那样厌恶。那用不着说、也用不着写的神秘语言使它明白：萨拉不可能恨它，它便慢慢地靠近面包屑，吃了起来。它边吃边时不时地朝萨拉看，刚才那些麻雀也是这样，然而它那副充满歉意的神情感动了萨拉。

她一动不动地坐着，看着它，有块特别大的面包屑——事实上根本不能算是“屑”了，那老鼠当然非常想得到那一块，可是它距离矮凳很近，老鼠还是有些提心吊胆。

“我相信他想把这点面包带到墙壁中的家里去，”萨拉想道，“要是我一动不动，或许他会过来叼走它。”

她兴致勃勃地屏声静息，仔细看着。那老鼠挪近些，又吃掉了一些面包屑，随后停下，小小心心地嗅着，斜着眼注视了一眼坐在矮凳上的人，然后立即朝那块碎面包冲过去，那劲头就像那只麻雀，来了个突然袭击，叼起碎面包来掉头就向墙边蹿去，钻进踢脚板的一道裂缝，不见了。

“我知道，他这是要把碎面包分给自己的孩子，”萨拉说，“我相信我一准能和他做成朋友。”

大约一个星期以后，在一个难得的晚上，埃芒加德找了个机会平安地偷偷上了阁楼，用指尖轻轻扣了扣房门，过了两三分钟后萨拉才来开门。屋子里静悄悄的，埃芒加德还以为萨拉睡熟了。后来，她吃惊地听见萨拉发出了一阵轻而短促的笑声，像是在哄劝谁。

“得了！”埃芒加德听到她说，“带回家，梅基塞代克！带回家给你妻子吧！”

萨拉很快打开了门，看到埃芒加德站在门槛上，惊得眼睛瞪得大大的。

“哪个——你在跟哪个说话，萨拉？”她喘着粗气问。

萨拉轻手轻脚地拉她进了屋，看得出什么事让她又开心又高兴。

“你得答应我，不要惊慌——万万不能尖声怪叫，要不我就不跟你说。”她说。

埃芒加德感到自己快忍不住就要喊出声来了，可是她拼命克制住了自己。她往屋内看了看，可什么也没看到，可萨拉刚才确实在与谁说话，她想到了鬼怪。

“那会不会是——怕人的东西？”她胆战心惊地问道。

“有的人怕他们，”萨拉说，“最初我也怕——现在不怕了。”

“是——鬼吗？”埃芒加德打了个寒战。

“不是，”萨拉笑着说，“是我的小老鼠。”

埃芒加德一下子跳了起来，落到那张肮脏的小床中间，双脚藏进了睡衣和红披肩里，她没叫，却吓得一直在喘着粗气。

“哎哟！哎哟！”埃芒加德放低了声音惊叫着，“老鼠！一只老鼠！”

“我就知道你会害怕的，”萨拉说，“其实不用害怕。我正在训练他，其实他与我混得很熟了，只要我叫他一声，他会就出来。你不会怕得不敢见一见吧？”

实际情况是，随着时间一天天过去，靠着从厨房带上来的面包皮，萨拉与老鼠建立起了这种奇异的友情，她已经慢慢忘记：那个越来越熟悉的胆小小动物不过是只老鼠而已。

开始时埃芒加德只是在床上惊恐地缩成一团，双脚也裹了起来，可是见到萨拉小脸上坦然自若的神情，并且知道了有关梅基塞代克初次出现的经过后，终于引起了好奇心，身子探出床外，看着萨拉走到踢脚板上的洞口前跪着。

“它——是不是蹿到床上来？”她问。

“不会，”萨拉回答说，“他与我们一样有礼貌，他跟人一模一样。快瞧！”

只听她的嘴里发出一阵低低的口哨声——声音很轻很轻，十分诱人，只有在绝对安静的环境下才能听到。她全神贯注地吹了好几声，埃芒加德以为她就像是在施展法术。那只长着灰胡须和亮眼睛的老鼠最终应声从洞里探出头来，萨拉手里早就准备好了些面包屑。她把面包屑放在地上，梅基塞代克轻轻地过来吃。它叼住中间最大的一块，郑重其事地带回家去了。

“跟你说吧，”萨拉说，“他这是带给妻子和孩子们的，他十分善良，只吃掉一些小碎屑。他一进窝，我都能听到他那一家人兴奋得吱吱叫。总共有三种叫法：一种是孩子们在叫，一种是梅基塞代克的太太，还有一种是梅基塞代克自己的。”

埃芒加德笑开了。

“噢，萨拉！”她说，“你确实怪——可你心肠好。”

“我知道我很怪，”萨拉愉快地承认道，“要说心肠，我尽量做个好心肠的人。”她那棕色的小手抹了抹前额，脸上出现一种困惑却又很温柔的神情。“爸爸总是笑话我，”她说，“可是我愿意那样。他以为我怪，可他也挺喜欢我编的故事。我——我不由自主地这样做。不然的话，我想我就活不下去了。”说到这里，她没有说下去，打量一下屋子。“我在这儿肯定是活不了的。”她低声道。

埃芒加德听得津津有味。她一向都这样。“什么事给你一说，”她道，“听起来，越说越成真的了。你说梅基塞代克的口气，简直把它当成人了。”

“他就是人，”萨拉说，“他会感到饿，感到害怕，和咱们一样，结了婚，有孩子。那么，能说他跟咱们不一样，不会动脑子吗？你看他的眼神跟咱们人一模一样，所以我才给他取了个名字。”

萨拉坐在地板上，双手抱着双膝。她就爱这么坐着。

“再说，”她说，“他是一只巴士底监狱的老鼠，是来跟我做朋友的。我总是可以从厨娘那里得到一些扔掉的面包，这足够他活了。”

“这里是巴士底监狱？”埃芒加德急切地问，“你老是把这里假设成巴士底监狱吗？”

“差不多，”萨拉回答说，“有时我想假设这是别的地方，可是往往很容易就假设成巴士底监狱——特别是天冷的时候。”

这时，埃芒加德几乎从床上跳下来。她被一种声音吓了一大跳。清清楚楚的，像是两下敲墙声。

“什么声音？”她喊道。

萨拉站起来，好像演戏一样说：

“是隔壁牢房的囚犯。”

“贝基！”埃芒加德高兴地叫起来。

“是的，”萨拉说，“听，敲两下意思是：‘囚犯，你在吗？’”

萨拉在墙上敲了三下，好像在回答。

“这是说：‘是的，我在。没事儿。’”

贝基那边传来了四下敲墙声。

“这是，”萨拉解释道，“‘好了，难友，咱们安安心心地睡觉吧，晚安。’”

埃芒加德听得眉开眼笑。

“噢，萨拉！”她高兴地小声说，“跟故事里一模一样！”

“这就是故事呀，”萨拉说，“一切的一切全是故事，你是一个故事——我是一个故事。明卿小姐也是一个故事。”

萨拉又坐了下来，说着，说着，一直说到埃芒加德竟忘了自己是个逃亡中的囚犯，后来萨拉提醒她不可以在巴士底监狱里留宿，得悄悄下楼，回自己的空床睡觉去。





十　印度绅士


然而，对埃芒加德和洛蒂来说，到阁楼去拜访自己敬慕的萨拉是件冒险的事儿。她俩搞不清萨拉什么时候会回到那儿，更摸不准艾米丽亚小姐什么时候会在学生睡后去巡视卧室。她俩难得去阁楼看望萨拉一次，因而萨拉过的是奇特而孤单的日子。比起在阁楼上，她在楼下的日子更孤单，没有谁与她说说话。每次被人差遣去干杂差，她就成了个可怜巴巴的小姑娘，挎着篮子或挟着包包，走在街上；遇到刮风的天气她还要拼命地捂紧帽子；遇到下雨天，雨水从鞋子里渗进来；看见行人匆匆擦身而过，她感到越发孤单。想当年，自己被人尊为“萨拉公主”的日子，在玛丽埃塔陪伴、伺候下，坐着四轮马车，或走在大街上，身穿丽装华服，脸上熠熠生辉，喜气洋洋，光彩照人，始终引得路人观望。这样一名幸福而受人精心呵护的漂亮小姑娘能不引人注目吗？而穿得破破烂烂、可怜巴巴的孩子街上多的是，也不好看，哪有人会转过身来搭理她，对她微笑呢？如今再也没人注意萨拉了。当她匆匆从人来人往的人行道上经过时，谁也不理会她了。她开始迅速地长个儿，但能穿的只有剩下的普普通通几件旧衣服。她知道这样的打扮看起来一定会很古怪。那些值钱的衣服已被处理掉了，那些剩下的她得一直穿下去，能穿多久就穿多久。有时候，路过商店有镜子的橱窗时，看到自己现在的模样，她忍不住笑出声来，有时候羞红了脸，咬紧嘴唇，扭头就走。

傍晚时，她路过窗户里亮着灯光的房子，这时候，她都会忍不住偷偷地往里瞟上几眼。在她的想象中，人们坐在温暖的壁炉前或围着饭桌，这时她觉得自己也快乐起来了。在百叶窗尚未拉上之前，能看看房里的情景对她也是一件乐事。明卿小姐居住的广场旁边住了几户人家，萨拉以自己独特的方式已摸清他们的一些情况。其中一家，她最喜欢，被她称为“大家庭”。之所以称“大家庭”倒不是这一家人的个子长得高——他们其实多数是小孩子——而是因为他们的家庭成员多。“大家庭”里的小孩子就有八个，他们的母亲身体壮实，长着一张红润的脸；父亲身体也很壮实，也长着一张红润的脸；他们的祖母身体也很壮实，也有红润的脸。他们家里的佣人也非常多。八个孩子时常由大人们领着散步，要么坐在童车上，由保姆舒舒服服地推着，要么跟妈妈坐着马车出游。傍晚，他们飞奔到门口去迎接爸爸，亲吻他，围着他又蹦又跳，有时候扯下爸爸的大衣，想在口袋里翻点什么礼物出来，要么挤在儿童室的窗口朝外张望，你推我搡，有说有笑——反正他们日子过得快快活活的，一派大家庭其乐融融的氛围。萨拉喜欢他们，还给他们取了书中用过的名字——都是些很浪漫的名字。有时候萨拉不称他们为“大家庭”，就换另一种说法，管他们叫蒙特莫伦西一家。她管那个头戴花边婴儿帽的胖娃娃叫埃塞尔伯塔·比彻姆·蒙特莫伦西，管稍大的叫维奥莱特·乔莫德·蒙特莫伦西，那个刚学会用两条圆滚滚的小腿蹒跚学步的小男孩叫西德尼·塞西尔·维维安·蒙特莫伦西。接下来，依次为利莲·伊万杰琳·莫德·马里恩、罗莎琳德·格拉迪斯、盖伊·克拉伦斯、维罗尼加·尤斯塔西亚和克劳德·哈罗德·赫克托。

一天傍晚，发生了一件有趣的事。不过，从某种意义上说这也许算不得是件十分有趣的事。

那天，蒙特莫伦西家几个孩子显然要去参加一个儿童聚会。萨拉刚要经过他们家门口时，几个小家伙正穿过人行道要登上正在等候他们的马车。维罗尼加·尤斯塔西亚和罗莎琳德·格拉迪斯身着饰有花边的连衣裙，系着漂亮的腰带，刚钻进马车。紧随其后的是五岁的盖伊·克拉伦斯。他长得非常可爱，脸蛋像玫瑰花一般红润，眼睛湛蓝湛蓝的，霎时间，萨拉看得完全忘了自己是个手中拎着篮子、身上穿着破衣烂衫的可怜小姑娘——事实上她彻底忘了形，只想多看他一会儿。于是，她停下脚步看了起来。

那正是圣诞节期间，“大家庭”的孩子们曾听人讲过许多穷孩子的故事，没有爹娘往他们的袜子里塞礼物，不带他们去看圣诞演出的童话剧——他们缺衣少食，饥寒交迫。故事里说，心地善良的人——有些小孩子也有这样的热心肠——总会去探望这些可怜的穷孩子，送给他们钱或许许多多的礼物，带他们回家一起参加热热闹闹的圣诞聚会。那天下午，盖伊·克拉伦斯刚读过这样的故事，感动得快要掉泪了，于是他心里出现一个强烈的愿望，很想找到这么一个穷孩子，把自己的六便士硬币送给她，让她过上好日子。他觉得整整六便士是个不少的数目，完全可以让她过上富足的日子了。他从家门口穿过人行道一直来到马车门，车门前铺着一条红地毯，他从红地毯走过时，在他短短的水兵式裤子的裤兜里就放着六便士硬币。当罗莎琳德·格拉迪斯钻进车厢，在座位上坐下来，美美地享受坐垫的一弹一跳，而盖伊·克拉伦斯看到萨拉站在湿漉漉的人行道上，一身的破衣烂衫，胳膊上挽了个旧篮子，正出神地看着他。

他认为这小姑娘流露出饥饿的眼神，说不定她很久没有吃过东西了。他却不知道那是因为她渴望他家庭的温馨，以及他那张因悉心照料而显得红润的脸所焕发出的幸福神采。萨拉多么想把他搂到怀里亲吻。盖伊·克拉伦斯却不知道她的这些想法，他只看到一个长着大眼睛的小姑娘，脸是那么瘦削，两腿是那么纤细，身上的衣服是那么破烂，手里还提着一只普普通通的篮子。盖伊·克拉伦斯把手伸进口袋，把六便士硬币掏出来，满怀善意走到她的身边。

“可怜的小姑娘，拿着吧。”他说，“这里有六便士，送给你。”

萨拉吃了一惊，但马上就明白这是怎么回事了。想当年自己阔绰时，从四轮马车上下来，人行道上站着的穷孩子也是这样望着自己，现在她跟他们一模一样了。她也经常施舍那些人。想到这里，她的脸一会儿红一会儿白，一时间只觉得自己不该接受这枚数目虽小却很珍贵的六便士硬币。

“啊，不！”她说，“哦！不，谢谢你。可我真的不能要！”

她说话的口气与街头上一般的穷孩子完全不同，她的举止看起来像个很有教养的孩子。维罗尼加·尤斯塔西亚（其实她的真名是珍妮特）和罗莎琳德·格拉迪斯（她的真名为诺拉）便探身车外，听听到底是怎么回事。

可是盖伊·克拉伦斯出于一片好心，他说什么也不会就此罢休，硬是把硬币塞到了萨拉的手里。

“不行，这钱你得拿着！”他语气坚决，“拿它买些吃的。这可是整整六便士哩！”

他的表情非常真诚和善良，要是萨拉仍然固执己见，真不知道让他有多伤心失望。萨拉不忍心再拒绝他了。要是再表现得那么骄傲，对人可就太残酷无情了。说实在的，她收下的不单是钱，装进口袋的是自己的尊严。这里必须要提一句：这时她的脸颊红了起来。

“谢谢你，”她说，“你是个心肠极好极好的小孩子。”当他高高兴兴地钻进马车，她走开去，尽量想笑出来，但只觉得心头堵得慌，眼睛里噙满了泪水。此前她觉得自己古怪，衣衫褴褛，怎么也没有想到在人家眼里自己已成了叫花子了。

“大家庭”的马车走了，车中的孩子们高兴得有说有笑。

“我说，唐纳德（这是盖伊·克拉伦斯的真名），”珍妮特大声提醒道，“干吗把你那六便士给那个小姑娘？我敢肯定她不是叫花子。”

“她说话不像！”诺拉大声道，“脸上的表情也不像叫花子的表情！”

“再说她也没有主动向你讨要，”珍妮特说，“我担心你让她生气了。要知道，人家穷是穷，可不是叫花子，你硬要把他们当成是叫花子，他们一准会生你的气。”

“她没有生气，”唐纳德说，他有点儿沮丧，但还是觉得自己没错，“她冲我笑了，夸我是个心肠极好极好的小孩哩。我本来就是！”唐纳德的口气还是很坚决，“要知道，我全部的钱就那六便士。”

珍妮特和诺拉交换了眼色。

“叫花子是说不出那样的话的，”珍妮特坚持己见，“要是她是叫花子，她只能对你说：‘谢谢你，好心的小少爷——谢谢你，少爷。’说不定她还会行个屈膝礼呢。”

他们的这番议论，萨拉自然是不知情的。但是从那以后，“大家庭”的孩子们对她深深关注起来，同样萨拉也对他们深感兴趣。每次萨拉经过他们的窗下，儿童室的窗口总会探出几个小脑袋。当他们在炉边围坐下来，也时常谈起萨拉。

“她是寄宿学校里的女仆，”珍妮特说，“我相信她没有家，我相信她是孤儿。尽管她穿得破破烂烂，可不是叫花子。”

此后他们都称呼她为“不是叫花子的姑娘”。这自然是个很长的名字，那几个年纪最小的孩子急急忙忙说起来就显得非常可笑。

萨拉在那个六便士的硬币上钻了个孔，用—条旧的细缎带穿起来，挂到了脖子上。她对“大家庭”越来越有好感——事实上，她对自己喜欢的一切的爱心也与日俱增。她更喜欢贝基了。每星期两个早晨到教室里给年龄较小的孩子们上法语课，成了她最盼望的事情。小学生们喜爱她，都争先恐后地挤到她面前，抢着与她握手。孩子们争相偎依在她的身边，充实了她渴望的心。她站在阁楼的桌子上和麻雀交朋友，把脑袋和肩膀探出窗外，学着麻雀发出叽叽喳喳的叫声，很快就可以听到一阵扑打翅膀和叽叽喳喳的回应，接着，就会飞来一大群肮里肮脏的城里小鸟，落在瓦片上，与萨拉对话，享用萨拉撒出去的面包屑。萨拉和梅基塞代克的关系很好，有时候，它甚至带上自己的太太—起来看望萨拉，偶尔，也会带上一两个孩子。她时常与它说话，不知怎的，那老鼠好像能听懂她说的话。

萨拉对爱米丽产生了一种奇怪的感觉。你看爱米丽总是坐在那儿，看着周围的一切。特别是萨拉孤单的时候，这种感觉更加强烈。萨拉乐于相信，或假装相信爱米丽会理解她，同情她。她不愿承认，她唯一的伴侣居然毫无感觉，对一切充耳不闻。有时候，她把爱米丽放在椅子上，自己在那红色的旧矮凳上面对着它坐下来，凝视着它，想象着有关爱米丽的故事，想着，想着，眼睛睁得大大的，流露出类似恐惧的神色——特别是在夜里，万籁俱寂的时刻。这时候，阁楼上能听到的，只有墙壁里梅基塞代克一家时而发出的奔跑声和吱吱声。在萨拉的想象中，爱米丽是—个好心肠的女巫，能保护她。有时候，她一直盯着爱米丽，她的幻想达到了高潮，这时，她就会向爱米丽提问，她觉得爱米丽几乎就要答复她的问题了。可是爱米丽还是没有开口。

“不过，要说回答，”萨拉自我安慰起来，“我也经常不回答别人。能不回答的我也尽量不回答。当别人侮辱你的时候，对付他们的最好办法就是一声不吭——眼睛盯着，只管想自己的事。我也这么对待明卿小姐，每次都会气得她脸色发白。艾米丽亚小姐显得很害怕，其他的女孩子也是这样。面对人家的挑衅，你能做到不动声色，他们就会觉得你比他们强，因为你能压住自己的怒火，可他们不能，他们只能说些蠢话，事后想起来悔恨莫及。大发雷霆算是厉害了吧，可要是能压得住不发火，那才厉害呢。给你的敌人来个不理不睬那是对付他们最好的办法。我有时候就做不到。爱米丽可能做得比我好，甚至连朋友的问话也不回答，有什么全藏在心里不说出来。”

她竭力搬出这些道理来自我安慰，却发现其实这是一件很难做到的事。一天到晚，她总是被差来遣去，干着累活，不管刮风下雨，也不管天寒地冻，出了远差，回来时浑身湿透，又累又饿，却又有差事需要出门，没有人愿意想到她只是个小姑娘，瘦小的双腿已经疲惫不堪，羸弱的身子已经被冻得冰凉，可得到的报酬只是粗暴的话语和冷酷、轻蔑的目光。这时候厨娘粗俗蛮横，明卿小姐正好心情极端恶劣，女孩子们私下里还要不断嘲笑她穿得破破烂烂，而爱米丽直挺挺地端坐在自己的旧椅子上，对她干瞪眼——这种时候她那颗受伤却高傲而又孤寂的心，怎么能够单依靠幻想来安慰呢？

一天深夜，萨拉又冷又饿地回到阁楼上。她那幼小的胸膛里燃烧着怒火，看到爱米丽的目光是那样的空洞，锯末填充的胳膊和腿没有一丝生机，面对这情景她再也按捺不住了。这里除了爱米丽别无其他的人——这世界空无一人。她坐了下来。

“我真的活不了多久了。”开始时她说了这么一句话。

爱米丽只是对她干瞪眼。

“我受不了啦，”可怜的孩子浑身哆嗦，说道，“我知道快要死了。我好冷呀，浑身湿透。我饿得快没命了。天知道我今天去了多少地方，那些人一天到晚只知道骂我。我没能买回厨娘打发我去买的最后一件东西，他们便不让我吃饭。一些人嘲笑我，因为我的鞋子太破了，陷进烂泥里，人滑倒了。我脏得像个泥猴子。他们见了反而哈哈大笑。你听到我说的话了吗？”

不知道怎么回事，这一次她看着那双圆睁的玻璃眼睛和那充满自得的脸，一股撕心裂肺的怒火突然在心底里燃烧起来。她恶狠狠地抬手将爱米丽从椅子上打落下来，她哭了——萨拉从没这样放声哭泣过。

“你什么也不是，只是个洋娃娃！”她哭喊道，“什么也不是，只是个洋娃娃——洋娃娃——洋娃娃！你什么也不在乎。你一肚子只是木屑。你没心没肺，冷酷无情。你只是个洋娃娃！”

爱米丽躺在地板上，不雅观地曲起膝盖，弯在头上，鼻尖上又有一处摔扁了，但她还是显得心平气和，不失尊严。萨拉把脸埋进双臂里。墙洞里的老鼠厮打起来，吱吱尖叫。梅基塞代克正追逐家庭的某个成员。

萨拉哭得没有先前那么厉害了。她一向可不是这样绝望，她为自己的表现感到吃惊。过了—会儿，她扬起脸看着爱米丽，爱米丽也似乎在偷偷地斜着眼打量她，不知怎的，那双玻璃眼中居然流露出了同情。萨拉弯腰把她抱起来。她感到有些后悔，脸上露出一丝自嘲的微笑来。

“你天生就是洋娃娃，做不做洋娃娃由不得你自己，”她说，叹了口气，“你不像拉维尼亚和杰西，她俩是自己要做没感情的人。我们天生就不一样。你满肚子是锯末，做到现在这份儿上已尽力了。”萨拉亲了亲她，把她的衣服理理整齐，重新放回椅子。

她非常希望隔壁那栋空房子有人住。因为那家的阁楼窗子离她的很近。假如有一天看到那扇方窗框里探出一个脑袋、一对肩膀来，那多好呀！

“要是真的探出个可爱的脑袋来，”她想，“我先跟她打招呼：‘早晨好！’接下来什么事都可能发生。不过，当然啰，除了下等佣人还有谁会睡在那儿？”

一天早晨，萨拉先后去了杂货店、副食店和面包铺买了东西，经过广场拐角处时，欣喜地发现，自己离开这么长的一段时间里，有—辆满载家具的大车停在隔壁那栋房子前，前门敞开着，几个男子正忙着搬运沉重的箱包和家具。

“这里有人来住了！”她说，“真的有人来住了！啊，但愿阁楼窗口探出一个可爱的脑袋来！”

人行道上围着一堆闲人看着搬家，萨拉也想停下来看看热闹。她心想，如果能看到一些家具，就可以看出家具的主人是个怎样的人。

“明卿小姐家的桌椅板凳就跟她本人一模一样，”她想，“记得第一次看到她时我就是这么想的，虽然那时候我还是个小孩子。后来我把自己的想法对爸爸说了，爸爸听了直冲我笑，说我说得没错。我相信‘大家庭’一定有柔软、厚实、舒服的安乐椅和沙发，我看到他们的红花壁纸实在像他们本人，温馨、快乐、亲切和幸福。”

那天稍晚一些时候，她又被打发去蔬菜店买芹菜，当她从地下室阶梯走上平台时，她的心跳猛地加快起来，因为她发现了几件似曾相识的东西。几件从车上卸下来的家具摆在人行道上。其中就有一张漂亮的、精心镶拼起来的柚木桌子、几把椅子以及一架屏风，上面绷着华丽的东方刺绣品，这些东西让她油然而生思乡之情。在印度，她曾见过许多类似的东西。明卿小姐从她那儿拿走的东西中有一件就是雕花的柚木书桌，那是父亲送给她的。

“这些东西可真好看，”她说，“这样的家具只有高尚的人家才有。所有的东西看上去好华丽。想来这准是有钱人家了。”

装家具的大车忙了一整天，来了一车，卸下东西，走了，腾出地方让别的车子来。有几次恰好让萨拉碰上了，看到搬来的东西。可不是，她猜得没错：新搬来的人家准非常非常有钱。家具全都漂漂亮亮，十分华贵，很多还是东方式的。大车上搬下来的地毯、壁毯和饰物美极了，还有许许多多的图画。单书籍就足够办个图书馆了。还有一尊精致的佛像，装在华丽的神龛里。

“他们一准在印度待过，”萨拉想，“他们喜欢印度的东西，惯用这些东西。我真高兴。我觉得他们像朋友似的，即使没人从阁楼的天窗探出头来。”

给厨娘取晚上的牛奶时（样样活儿都得差她去干），她亲眼看见了一件事，这就使情况变得更加让她动心了。那位在“大家庭”里做父亲的男子，模样儿英俊，面色红润，一本正经地穿过广场，快步登上隔壁房子的台阶，那模样活像这里就是他的家，看来往后他要多次在这些台阶上上下下了。他在屋内待了好一会儿，后来几次出来指挥那些搬运工，就好像他有权这样做似的。看得出来，他与新来的这家人关系非常密切，在代他们办事。

“要是新来的人家有孩子，”萨拉寻思道，“那‘大家庭’的孩子一定会前来和他们—起玩，那样他们说不准为了好玩会到阁楼上去的。”

夜里，贝基干完了一天的活，进来看望自己的难友，带来一些消息。

“小姐，隔壁新搬来一位印度绅士，”她说，“他的皮肤黑不黑我不知情，可他准是印度人。他非常有钱，可是个病人。‘大家庭’的那位先生是他的律师。印度先生遇到了一大堆麻烦事儿，所以害上了病，情绪坏透了。他爱信那些个菩萨哩，小姐。他是个异教徒，见到木头和石头的菩萨都要下跪。我就见到他家搬进一尊菩萨，供他拜的。得送他一本布道的小册子。花—个便士就可买到的那种。”

萨拉听了，轻轻一笑。

“我不相信他会崇拜那个偶像，”她说，“有的人藏着偶像是为了摆着好看。比如说我爸爸，他就有一尊漂亮的佛像，可是他就不拜。”

贝基的心眼儿就是发死，认定了这个新邻居是个“异教徒”。这也不错，听起来至少要比一位带着祈祷书去教堂的普普通通先生更富有传奇色彩。那天夜里她俩坐着，聊了很久有关那位先生的事儿：新邻居是个怎么样的人？要是他有妻子，那么妻子长得怎么样？要是有孩子，那这些孩子又怎么样？萨拉看出，贝基巴不得这些孩子的皮肤全是黑的，头上缠着头巾，最重要的是——同他们的父母一样——全都是些“异教徒”。

“我压根没跟‘异教徒’做过邻居，小姐，”她说，“我倒想看看他们是怎么过日子的。”

几个星期后，她的好奇心才得到了满足。原来新邻居还没有妻子，也没有孩子。他是个单身汉，光棍一条。显而易见，他的身体很不好，情绪也很糟。

有一天，驶来一辆马车，在那幢屋前停了下来。佣人从驾驶座上下来，打开车门，首先下车的是“大家庭”的父亲。紧随其后的，是—名穿制服的护士。此时从大门台阶上下来两名男佣人，他们是来伺候房子的主人的。当主人被扶下了车，只见那是一个形容憔悴、神情沮丧的男子，瘦得皮包骨头，身上裹着一件毛皮大衣。他被扶上台阶，“大家庭”的家长走在一旁，显得忧心忡忡。不久之后，又一辆马车赶到了，从车上下来的是一名医生，他进入房屋——显然是来为房屋的主人看病的。

“隔壁住着这样一位黄皮肤的绅士，萨拉，”法语课上洛蒂悄悄说，“你认为他是中国人吗？地理书上说中国人的皮肤是黄色的。”

“不，他不是中国人，”萨拉也悄悄回答说，“他得了重病。继续做练习，洛蒂。跟我读：‘Non, monsieur.Je n’ai pas le canif de mon oncle.’”

印度绅士的故事从此开始了。





十一　拉姆·达斯


有时候，即使在广场上也能见到日落的景色，不过，见到的只能是烟囱之间和屋顶上的那部分。从厨房窗子看出去就什么也见不到了，倒是能猜到现在正是日落时分，因为这时墙上的砖短时间内显得暖烘烘的，天空也是一片粉红色或黄色，说不定有的地方的玻璃上反射出一道耀眼的光来。但是，有个地方能看见落日全部壮丽的景象，见到西方一团团云朵，是火红的或金色的，或是四周镶着夺目光华的紫色，也有片片浮云，染成了玫瑰色，宛如一群粉红色的鸽子在风中翻飞，有风时匆匆掠过蓝天。这个看到全部美景同时又能呼吸到更清新空气的地方，自然非阁楼天窗莫属了。尽管有灰迹斑斑的树木和围栏，当广场突然被迷人的光华所照耀，一切都显得灿烂辉煌，这时候萨拉便知道天空正在发生某种变化；这时候，只要可以脱身而不为人所觉察，不被叫回，萨拉就会悄悄离开厨房，爬上阁楼，登上那只旧桌子，尽可能把头和身子探出窗外。到了这时候她便深深地吸了口气，极目四望起来。这时候，她常常觉得，整片天空，整个世界都属于她。别的阁楼没有一个人在探窗眺望。那些天窗通常都是关着的。即使是支起来通风，也见不到一个人影。萨拉站立窗前，有时候抬头仰望蓝天，只觉得蓝天对她异常亲切，近在咫尺——不啻是头顶的天花板，只是呈穹形而已——有时候眼望西天，那边正发生种种奇妙的变幻：朵朵云彩或飘散，或浮游，或随时化成粉红、深红、雪白、绛紫或淡淡的鸽灰色。有时候云团幻成岛屿或群山，围绕其间的是湖泊，湖水是深绿松石色的，琥珀色的，或绿玉髓色的；有时候成了深黑的岬角延伸出去直达奇异的茫茫海洋；有时候一片片狭长的神奇陆地与另一片片神奇的陆地连在一起，有的地方你似乎可以去奔跑、攀登或稍立片刻，等着美景出现——最后，一切消融殆尽，你便飘然而去。至少，这是萨拉的感受。她立在桌上所见到的美丽景象是别的地方不可比拟的——她半个身子探出窗外——麻雀在石板瓦上、在柔和的落日中喳喳欢叫。在她看来，在这良辰美景，麻雀的叽喳声变得不那么刺耳，反而越发动听了。

那位印度绅士搬来几天后，就出现了这样的落日景象。幸运的是，下午厨房的活儿全干完了，没人差她到哪儿去，或交什么活让她去干，萨拉认为这下比平时更容易溜到阁楼去了。

她爬上桌子，张望起来。这真是个绝妙的时刻。西天团团金色浮云，光华夺目，翻翻滚滚，汹涌着要席卷整个世界。天空中闪烁着壮丽的深黄色光芒，屋顶上飞翔而过的鸟儿，在这黄光衬托下，显得影影绰绰。

“这是个辉煌壮丽的时刻，”萨拉低声喃喃道，“看得我几乎害怕起来了——担心会发生什么奇怪的事。每看到壮丽辉煌的景象我无不有这种感觉。”

猛地，她听到离自己只有几码的地方传来一个声音，不禁转过身去。这声音怪怪的。怪异的吱吱声，像是有人在低声絮语。声音从隔壁阁楼的天窗传过来。有人也像她那样来看日落了。从那天窗探出一个人的脑袋和小半个身子。可那不是小姑娘或丫环的脑袋和身子。那人身上披着白袍，脸孔黑黝黝的，眼睛闪闪发亮，头上缠着白头巾，焕发着异国风采，一看就知道是位印度人——“是个拉斯卡。”萨拉一下就看出来，脱口说道——方才她听到的吱吱声则来自那人手中抱着的小猴子。看来他非常喜欢这只猴子。猴子正偎依在他胸前吱吱叫着。

萨拉朝他看时他也朝萨拉看。这一眼给萨拉留下的第一个印象是，觉得这人那张黝黑的脸显得很忧郁，怀有浓厚的思乡之情。她完全肯定，他上楼来是看太阳的，因为在英国难得一见阳光，他太想看到阳光了。她兴致勃勃地瞥了他一眼，又隔着石板瓦朝他微微一笑。她知道，一个笑容，哪怕是陌生人的一笑，对人也是一大安慰。

萨拉这一笑显然令对方感到很高兴。他的整个表情都起了变化，他也回了她一笑，露出洁白的牙齿，亮晶晶的，像一道光，脸上那阴郁的神情随之一扫而光。萨拉友好的目光对疲惫而沮丧的人非常有感染力。

也许，为了对萨拉行额手礼，那人松开了手中的猴子。那是只十分调皮的猴子，随时都要惹些事来。也许是见了小姑娘它兴奋起来了。它突然挣脱开来，跳到石板瓦上，尖声叫着，跑了过来，跳到萨拉的肩膀上，又从肩上窜到阁楼里去。她看到这情景开心得哈哈笑了起来。她知道，猴子得马上归还主人——如果猴子的主人是拉斯卡的话——可就不知道怎么个还法。小猴子能让她抓住吗？它是不是很淘气让她抓不住呢？它是不是躲开，冲到屋顶上，跑得无影无踪？那不就完了吗？也许小猴儿是那印度绅士的，这位不幸的先生非常喜欢它。

她转身面对拉斯卡，还好自己还记得一些印度话，是她与父亲待在一起时学来的。她要让那人明白自己的意思。于是她就用对方熟悉的话说了起来。

“猴子能让我抓吗？”

一听对方说起自己熟悉的话来，那人黝黑的脸上露出又惊又喜的神色来。她觉得，自己从未见过这样的神情。事实上，那个可怜的人简直觉得他的神在显灵了，这样友善可爱的声音无异于来自天堂。萨拉立即看出，他已习惯于跟欧洲孩子相处了。只听得他连连说出大串尊敬感谢的话来。他说自己是尊贵小姐的仆人，猴子是只好猴子，不会咬人，遗憾的是，抓它不容易。它东逃西窜，快得像闪电，它不听话，可心眼儿不坏。拉姆·达斯像对自己的孩子那样了解它，有时候猴子听拉姆·达斯的话，但不总是那样。如果尊敬的小姐允许的话，拉姆·达斯可以从屋顶过来，爬进她的房间，把这只不中用的小畜生抓住。但是他担心，在萨拉看来，自己这样做是太放肆了，也许不允许他进去。

可是萨拉立即表示没意见。

“你过得来吗？”她问。

“这就过去。”他答。

“那就过来吧，”她说，“瞧它这会儿满屋子东窜西跑，像是吓坏了。”

拉姆·达斯钻出自己阁楼的窗子向她这边过来，动作又稳又轻，像是一辈子全在屋背上行走似的。他滑进了天窗，悄无声息地落到地板上，转身对着萨拉，又行了个额手礼。猴子一见他便轻声吱吱尖叫起来。拉姆·达斯赶紧采取了预防措施，把天窗关上，然后再去抓猴子，追了没多久。显然猴子是为了好玩才让他追了几分钟，很快就吱吱叫着，跳到他肩上，坐在那儿，伸出怪怪的、瘦巴巴的手臂抱住拉姆·达斯的脖子。

拉姆·达斯深深地道了谢。萨拉见这印度人的目光迅速地扫了房间一眼，他已看到房间十分简陋，但对萨拉说起话来像面对着的是位印度土邦的女儿，装作什么都没注意到似的。他抓到猴子后只逗留了一小会儿，很快就离开了。在他短暂的逗留期间，对萨拉的大度再次表示了深深的感激和谢意。他边拍着猴子边说，这小坏蛋看起来很调皮，其实并不坏，有时候还逗自己有病在身的主人高兴呢。要是自己的宠物跑掉了，丢失了，那准会让他伤心的。他说罢又行了个额手礼，便钻出天窗，健步如飞地在石板瓦上跑了起来，敏捷得不亚于刚才那猴子在石板瓦上施展出来的功夫。

那人走了后，萨拉立在阁楼中间，细细回味着那人的脸和举动，从而联想起许多事来。见了他一身印度特色的装束和对人恭恭敬敬的举止不由得勾起她对过去的记忆。想来何等的不可思议，不是吗，一小时前，她，一名听人差遣的小苦工，刚挨过厨娘的痛骂，可几年前，她仆从成群，个个都像拉姆·达斯那样对待她；她所过之处，人人都对她行额手礼，听她说话时，他们都垂着头，前额低得快要触地了，他们全都是听她使唤的奴仆佣人。想来也真不可思议，恍如梦中，全成了往事，一去不可返了。现状肯定无法改变。她知道明卿小姐想给她安排一个什么样的未来。只要她还不到当个正式教师的年龄，她只能被当作干杂活的丫头和女仆供人使唤，这不但要求她不可忘了过去学到的知识，还要她以不可思议的方式学到更多的东西。她得把更多的夜晚花在学习上，但是她知道，如果她没有取得进展，达不到要求，就要受到严厉的训斥。实际上，明卿小姐也知道，萨拉渴求知识，学习自觉，用不着教师督促。拿到书本，她就会埋头读起来，并且能牢牢记住书的内容。完全可以指望她在数年之内胜任教师工作，教大量课程。情况肯定就是这样。等她长到一定年龄，她还是和现在一样干苦活，所不同的是不在学校上上下下到处干，而在教室里。到时候只得让她穿得体面一些，但肯定只是些平平常常的衣服，不会漂亮的，看起来跟仆人差不多。前景只能是这样。就这样，萨拉一动不动站了好一会儿，把上面的事细细想了一通。

接着她的心中出现一个想法，禁不住双颊发红，两眼生辉，挺起那纤弱瘦小的身躯，抬起了头。

“任凭发生什么事，”她说，“有一点是不会变的。如果我是位穿着破衣烂衫的公主，那我是个精神上的公主。穿金戴银时当个公主固然轻而易举，但默默无闻时始终保持一颗公主的心，难道这不是更大的胜利吗？想当年玛丽·安托瓦妮特身陷牢笼时，失去了王后的尊位，身上穿的是一件黑布袍，一头白发，受尽百般羞辱，被称为‘卡佩寡妇’。但是比起当年锦衣玉食、显赫风光时，她更像王后。我最爱的是那时候的她。暴民对着她吼叫吓不倒她，即使要砍她的头时，她表现得比他们还要坚强。”

这些不是她刚想到的，之前她已经这样想过了。在众多苦难的日子里，这想法给了她很大的安慰。于是她在学校走动时，脸上挂着的表情，看起来像是这孩子生活在超越世上众人之上的精神世界里，这使得明卿小姐大惑不解，并且十分恼怒。这孩子对人家的粗言恶语似乎充耳不闻，不以为意；有时候萨拉受到严词训斥，明卿小姐发现她仍然若无其事，以一种不是孩子的目光盯着对方，仿佛伴有傲慢的微笑。她并不知道，这时候萨拉正暗自对自己说：

“你不知道你是在对公主说话，如果我高兴，只要我一挥手，就可以处死你。我饶你一命，是因为我是公主，而你是个可怜、愚蠢、恶毒、粗俗的老东西，不识时务。”

这往往给萨拉带来莫大的乐趣和快慰。虽说属于古怪的想象，她却从中得到慰藉，对她很有好处。每当她出现这种心态，任凭什么样的恶言秽语，粗鲁无礼，对她都不起作用。

“做公主的都得有教养。”她暗自说道。

因此，每逢别的奴仆们学着主子的腔调对她吆三喝五时，她始终高高昂起头，十分优雅地回答他们。面对这情景，他们无不惊得目瞪口呆。

“瞧这小家伙那样儿，一本正经的，像是位白金汉宫里的金枝玉叶。”有时候厨娘会咯咯地笑起来，说，“我没少跟她发火，我得说，可她就是不忘摆出有礼有貌的谱子，满嘴的‘对不起，师傅’‘请费心，师傅’‘请原谅，师傅’‘能打扰一下吗，师傅’，满厨房地说，全不当回事儿。”

在与拉姆·达斯和那小猴子邂逅后的第二天上午，萨拉与自己的小女生待在教室里。给她们上完课后，她把法语练习本收上来。收着，收着，不觉想到王公贵族们被派去乔装打扮、微服察访时的情形：就拿阿尔弗烈德大王来说吧，又要烤面饼，又挨牧牛人老婆的耳光。要是她知道自己打的是哪个，还不吓得半死？要是明卿小姐知道她萨拉——这个穿着露出脚趾破鞋的萨拉——果真是位公主，她该如何呢？此时萨拉所露出的目光正是明卿小姐最受不了的。这种目光她可不要看，当时恰好萨拉近在身旁，一气之下扑过去扇了萨拉几记耳光——活像牧牛人老婆扇阿尔弗烈德大王的耳光。这下把萨拉吓了一跳，她立时从梦中惊醒过来，强自定下神来，一动不动立了片刻，接着出人意料没来由地轻声笑了起来。

“你这不要脸的孩子，好放肆，有什么好笑的？”明卿小姐嚷嚷道。

萨拉花了几秒钟好不容易才忍住了笑，想起自己是位公主。她挨了耳光，脸颊火辣辣的，又红又痛。

“我在想事儿。”她答道。

“这就向我道歉。”明卿小姐说。

萨拉犹豫一会儿后，作出了回答。

“我为刚才的笑——要是有什么不礼貌的话——向你道歉，”她说，“不过想事儿没有什么好道歉的。”

“倒是想什么事儿？”明卿小姐逼问道，“你还敢想事儿？你倒是想什么事儿？”

杰西“嗤嗤”地笑了出来。她和拉维尼亚不约而同彼此用胳膊肘顶了顶对方。姑娘们都从书本上抬起头听了起来。每当明卿小姐为难萨拉时，她们都感到挺好玩的。萨拉往往说话古怪，一丁点儿也不害怕的样子。这次也一样，虽然挨了耳光，耳朵通红通红的，眼睛像星星亮闪闪的，但是没丁点儿害怕的样子。

“我在想，”她说得庄重而不失礼貌，“你还不知道自己在干了些什么。”

“你说我不知道自己干了些什么？”明卿小姐喘着大气，问道。

“是的，”萨拉说，“刚才我在想，要是你知道我是位公主，又打了我耳光，那会怎么样——我该怎么办。刚才我在想，要是我是公主，不管我说了什么又做了什么，你就不敢那样干。刚才我在想，你定会吃惊和害怕，要是你发现——”

眼前，她想象中的未来清晰地浮现出来，她说话的口气是那么的真切，连明卿小姐也受到了影响。在明卿小姐这么一个思想狭隘、缺乏想象力的人听来，一时间也觉得，萨拉直率大胆的话语背后必定藏匿着一股真正的力量。

“什么？”她大声嚷道，“你发现什么？”

“发现我原来是位公主，”萨拉说，“我无所不能——我想做的全都能办到。”

教室里的人无不把眼睛睁得溜圆溜圆的，拉维尼亚从座位上探出身子盯着看。

“回自己的房间去！”明卿小姐气急败坏地说，“立刻就走！离开教室！好好上你们的课，小姐们！”

萨拉微微鞠了一躬。

“如果我刚才笑了不礼貌，请原谅。”她说罢离开了教室，撇下明卿小姐待在那里怒气冲冲，又不好发作，女生们则把头俯在书本上，窃窃私语。

“你看见了吗？你倒是看见她那古怪的样子了吗？”杰西忍不住问道，“要是有一天她真的出人头地，我是不感到意外的。我猜她准成！”





十二　墙壁的另一边


你要是住在连片成排的房子里，猜想自己生活的房间墙壁的另一边的人都在干什么，说什么，定是件有意思的事儿。萨拉就爱这么做。她老喜欢试着想象与高等寄宿女校一墙之隔的印度绅士的事儿，乐此不疲。她知道教室紧挨着印度绅士的书房，但愿那堵墙很厚很厚，让有时下课后孩子们的喧闹声打扰不了他。

“我变得越来越喜欢他了，”她对埃芒加德说，“我不愿他受到干扰。我已经把他看成是朋友了。有的人你连话也没跟他们说过一句，就可以把他们看作是朋友。你只需好好观察他们，惦念他们，为他们难过，慢慢地他们差不多就成了你的亲人了。有时候见到大夫一天连来两次，我就为他急得不得了。”

“我的亲戚没几个，”埃芒加德若有所思地说，“我反而高兴。我那几个亲戚我不喜欢。我那两个姨妈老说：‘哎哟哟，埃芒加德！你够胖了，可不能再吃甜食了。’我那个叔叔老问我这样一类问题：‘爱德华三世哪年登的基？’‘哪个因为吃了鳗鱼撑死的？’”

萨拉不禁哈哈笑起来。

“从没跟你说过话的人决不会问你这样问题的，”她说，“我敢肯定，印度绅士即使跟你十分熟悉了，也不会问的。我挺喜欢他。”

她喜欢上“大家庭”是因为他们个个看上去显得很快活；她喜欢印度绅士是因为他看上去显得很不快活。显而易见，他害了什么重病，没有完全康复。厨房里——在那个地方，佣人们挺有能耐，通过种种神秘的途径什么事都能打听得到——对他的情况有很多说法。说他其实不是印度人，而是位在印度待过的英国人。他遭到大难，经过一次打击后一时间几乎害得他倾家荡产。他认为自己这一生算是毁了，再也没脸见人了，受到这么大的打击，又加上害了脑炎，差点把命也送了。从此他的健康彻底垮了，虽然后来时来运转，所有的财产又都回到他的手中。他的灾难和危机都是与开矿相关的。

“说是什么钻石矿哩！”厨娘说，“我存下的几个钱从不往矿山上投——尤其什么钻石矿，”说着瞟了一眼萨拉，“这些个劳什子咱们心中可有数哩。”

“他的遭遇跟我爸爸一个样，”萨拉暗自想道，“跟我爸爸一样，他也害病，还好没死。”

于是她的心跟他贴得更近了。每当夜里差她出去办事，有时候她反而感到很高兴，因为这样就趁隔壁家的窗帘没有放下，总有机会见到那暖和房间内部的情况，看到自己心中认定的朋友。每当身边没人时，她就停下来，抓住铁栏杆，祝他晚安，像是他会听到似的。

“即使你听不到，也感觉得到。”她就这样想象着，“也许善良的愿望甚至能穿过门窗和墙壁，到达人的心灵。当我站在这寒冷地方，祝愿你康复，重新快活起来，你也许因此会感到一丝温暖，得到小小的安慰，虽然不知道为什么。我真为你难过。”说到这里她的语气很真切，声音压得很低很低，“但愿你有个‘小主妇’，她能抚慰你，就像当年在我爸爸头疼时，我抚慰他一样。我甘心做你的‘小主妇’，可怜的人儿！晚安——晚安！上帝保佑你！”

说罢她走了，只觉得心里暖和一些，人也宽慰多了。她怀着非常强烈的同情心，觉得自己的这番心意必定能通过某种途径为他所接受，她觉得此时此刻，他必定孤独地坐在炉火边的安乐椅上，大概始终穿一件宽大的睡袍，始终一手托着脑门，绝望地盯着炉火。在萨拉的眼中，他这个人仍然心事重重，而且不单单是为过去的事而烦恼。

“他看起来老在想什么现在还让他痛苦的事，”她自言自语道，“他已拿回自己的钱，脑病迟早也会好起来的，所以不该这样呀。看来他还有别的烦心事。”

如果他还有什么烦心事——连仆人也不知情的烦心事——那么，她不禁想到“大家庭”的父亲——她管他叫蒙特莫伦西先生，相信他是知道的。蒙特莫伦西先生常常去探望他，蒙特莫伦西夫人和那几个小蒙特莫伦西也都去，只是不常去。印度绅士似乎对两个岁数较大的女孩特别喜欢——就是珍妮特和诺拉，也就是当时小弟弟唐纳德送给萨拉六便士硬币时，显得很担心的那两个小姑娘。事实上，这位先生对所有的孩子都怀有一颗温柔的心，尤其是小女孩。他喜欢珍妮特和诺拉，珍妮特和诺拉同样也喜欢他。她俩兴致勃勃地盼着某几个下午快快到来，到时候她俩就可以穿过广场，规规矩矩地短时间拜访他；拜访时得端庄有礼，时间不能过长，因为对方有病在身。

“他好可怜，”珍妮特说，“他说，见到我们他就高兴起来。我们尽量不吵不闹，变着法儿让他高兴起来。”

珍妮特是这几个孩子的头儿，孩子们都听她的。什么时候该小心地请印度绅士讲印度的故事得由她来定，什么时候印度绅士累了、她们得悄悄离开，并告诉拉姆·达斯过来伺候也得由她来定。她们都喜欢拉姆·达斯。要是他不是只会讲印度话，那准能讲许许多多的故事。那位印度绅士其实有名有姓，他叫卡里斯福特先生。珍妮特曾把遇见一个“不是叫花子的女孩”的事跟卡里斯福特先生讲了。他非常感兴趣，特别是听拉姆·达斯讲起屋顶猴子历险后，兴致更浓了。拉姆·达斯把那阁楼和室内凄凉的图景详详细细给他描述了一番——说到光秃秃的地板没铺地毯，墙上灰泥剥落，锈迹斑斑的空火炉，硬邦邦的狭窄的床。

“卡迈克尔，”听了这番描述后，他对“大家庭”的父亲说，“我真想知道，这广场四周有多少这样的阁楼。有多少遭殃的小使女睡的是这样的床，可我呢，躺在羽绒枕上为那些财富——大部分不属于我的财富，闹得心绪不宁、寝食不安。”

“我亲爱的朋友，”卡迈克尔先生快活地说，“快别为这档子事活活折磨自己了，这对你没好处。即使全印度的财产都归了你，你也解决不了世上所有不公平的现象。你就是着手把这广场上所有的阁楼都装修好，还有多多少少别的广场和街道也需要装修？情况就是这样。”

卡里斯福特先生坐在壁炉前，眼望着熊熊炭火，嘴里啃着指甲。

“你认为，”过了一会儿，他慢慢地开口道，“你认为，那个女孩子——我念念不忘的那个女孩子——她可不可能——我相信完全有可能——也会沦落到隔壁那个可怜女孩子那种悲惨的境地呢？”

卡迈克尔先生不安地看了看他。他知道，无论对这个人自身，还是对他的健康和那件事，最糟的莫过于对这个独特的问题开始用这样独特的方式来思考。

“如果巴黎帕斯卡尔夫人学校的那个孩子就是你要找的那个，”他劝道，“那么看来她完全有可能已得到有能力供养她的人家照顾。他们收养她是因为她是他们已故小女儿最喜欢的伴侣。他们只有这么一个女儿，帕斯卡尔夫人说，他们是很富有的俄国人。”

“可是那个该死的女人居然不知道那俄国人把她弄到哪里去了！”卡里斯福特先生高声喊道。

卡迈克尔先生耸了耸肩。

“她是个精明又世故的法国人。女孩父亲死后什么生活费用也没给她留下，她能轻轻松松地卸掉这包袱，何乐而不为？像她这类女人都一个样，才不为拖累自己的孩子的前途考虑呢。收养她的那对夫妻已不知去向，踪迹全无了。”

“你说‘如果那是我找的女孩子’，你说的是‘如果’，就是说不是百分之百，而且姓名也不同。”

“听帕斯卡尔夫人说起来是卡鲁，而不叫克鲁——也许只是发音稍有差异造成的，情况却惊人的相似。有位在印度服役的英国军官曾把一个没娘的小女孩送进这所学校。他因破产突然死了。”说到这里卡迈克尔先生停了下来，像是临时想起了什么，“你能肯定确实是在巴黎吗？”

“我亲爱的朋友，”卡里斯福特激动地说道，显得不安与痛苦，“我什么也肯定不了。我没见过那孩子，也没见过她母亲。拉尔夫·克鲁和我从小就很要好，但离开学校后就没见过面，后来是在印度相逢的。矿山辉煌的前景深深吸引了我。他也着了迷。整个事业规模宏大且十分诱人，害得我们都失去了理智。我俩碰在一起只说这事，别的什么也不谈。所以我只知道这孩子被送到某地的一所学校去了。现在我甚至想不起我是怎么听来的。”

他开始激动起来。一提到过去的灾难，他那仍然虚弱的心总要激动起来。

卡迈克尔先生焦虑地望着他。有几个问题需要问问他，但是务必小心谨慎，平心静气。

“你说的确在巴黎，有什么根据？”

“有，”他答道，“因为她母亲是法国人，我听说她希望自己的孩子在巴黎接受教育，所以完全有可能送她到巴黎去。”

“是呀，”卡迈克尔先生答道，“看来可能性很大。”

印度绅士身子前倾，那只修长而虚弱的手敲着桌子。

“卡迈克尔，”他说，“我一定要找到她。只要她活在人世，总能找到那个地方。如果她落到无依无靠、穷困潦倒的境地，那完全是我造成的。一个人心里背着这样的包袱，他怎么能心安理得呢？矿山事业突然的大转机使我们时来运转，美梦成真，可克鲁可怜的孩子可能在街上乞讨！”

“别，别！”卡迈克尔说，“别激动。不妨这么想：一旦找到她，你就有机会把财产交给她。这么一想你就心安理得了。”

“为什么在濒临绝境的时候我不像个男子汉挺身而出顶住呢？”卡里斯福特痛苦地呻吟道，“我相信，我要不是不单是为自己，而且也为别人的钱负责，我就会坚持下去的。可怜的克鲁倾其所有投资了这事业。他信任我——他也喜欢我。可是他死时一定认为是我毁了他——我，汤姆·卡里斯福特，伊顿公学时和他玩过板球的卡里斯福特。他肯定把我看成是个恶棍了！”

“别过于自责。”

“我自责，不是因为那项投资有彻底失败的危险——而是因为我丧失了勇气。我像个骗子和小偷临阵脱逃，因为无颜面对自己最要好的朋友，告诉他是我毁了他和他的孩子。”

“大家庭”的心地善良的父亲把一只手放到对方肩上，安慰他。

“你走掉是因为当时你心力交瘁，精神负担过重，”他说，“你变得脑子糊涂了。不然的话，你一定会坚持下去处理好问题的。离开那地方两天后，你一病不起，困在医院里，脑病折磨得你尽说胡话。别忘了当时的实际情况。”

“上帝！确实如此，”他说，“我担惊受怕，惊慌失措，人都要疯了。一连好几星期我睡不着觉。那天晚上，我跌跌撞撞地跑出家门，满天满地像充斥着不怀好意的怪物在嘲笑我、羞辱我。”

“这足以说明问题了，”卡迈克尔先生说，“一个脑炎即将发作的人怎么能作出清醒的判断？”

卡里斯福特摇了摇低垂的头。

“等我清醒过来，可怜的克鲁已经死了——也下葬了。我似乎什么也想不起来。连续好多个月我都没有想到那小孩子。即使后来想起有这么个孩子，记忆中的一切也像是在迷雾中，模糊一片。”他稍停片刻，揉了揉额头，“即使是现在，想起来也还是模糊不清的。克鲁什么时候肯定跟我说起过她被送到哪所学校的事。你看呢？”

“他可能没有说得很具体。你好像从来没听人说起过她叫什么名字吧？”

“他一直用一个古怪小名称呼她，称她是自己的‘小主妇’。都是这该死的矿山害得我们把别的事全撇开不放在心里了。除了矿山我们什么也不谈。就算他提起过那学校，我已忘了——被我忘了。现在怎么也想不起来。”

“得了，得了，”卡迈克尔说，“反正我们会找到她的。我们接着找，把帕斯卡尔夫人说的好心的俄国夫妇找到。她好像还模模糊糊地记得，那两个人住在莫斯科。以此为线索，我去一趟莫斯科。”

“要是我出得了门，就跟你一起去。”卡里斯福特说，“可是我只能裹着皮衣，在炉火前傻看。看着，看着，就像在炉火中看到克鲁那张年轻快活的脸也看着我。他像是在问我一个问题。有时候晚上做梦，梦见他，始终站在我面前，开口问我同样的问题。你可知道，他问什么吗，卡迈克尔？”

卡迈克尔先生用非常轻的声音回答他。

“我说不准。”他道。

“他总是问：‘汤姆，老朋友——汤姆，‘小主妇’在哪里？’”他说罢，抓住卡迈克尔的手，紧紧捏着，“我必须回答他——必须回答！”他说，“帮助我找到她，帮帮我吧！”

墙的另一边，萨拉就坐在阁楼里，正同梅基塞代克说着话，它这是出来找寻晚餐的。

“现如今做个公主可真不易啊，梅基塞代克，”她说，“比往常要难得多了。随着天越来越冷，街上越来越泥泞，公主就更难做了。今天我在门厅从拉维尼亚身边经过时，她就笑话我身上的裙子满是泥泞，我猛地闪过一个念头，想回击她——到头来还是忍住了。一想到自己是个公主，可不能用讥笑来回击讥笑。那只好咬紧牙关硬忍下去。我倒是咬紧牙没说出来。梅基塞代克，今儿下午天可冷啦，晚上也很冷。”

说到这里，她猛地把满是黑发的脑袋埋进双臂。每逢她感到孤独时，常常这样。

“哦，爸爸，”她低声道，“我是你的‘小主妇’，那好像是好久好久以前的事了。”

这就是那天在墙壁两边发生的事情。





十三　一个小百姓


这年冬天十分寒冷。有几天萨拉外出办杂差都得踩着雪走。有时候更糟，雪化了和泥泞搅在一起，成了一片稀泥浆。还有些日子，雾很浓很浓，大街上连大白天也得点上灯。整个伦敦就像几年前的那个下午，当时马车驶过大街，萨拉蜷坐在座位上，依偎着父亲的肩膀。遇到这种日子，“大家庭”家的窗子就显得温暖舒适，特别诱人，让人感到愉悦。印度绅士待着的书房透出温暖绚丽的色调。然而，阁楼却一片难言的凄惨。再也见不到日出、日落的美景，萨拉觉得连星星也不露脸了。天窗外低低压着云层，天空不是灰色的，便是黑糊糊的，像是一片泥泞，要不就下起大滴大滴的雨点来。下午四点钟，即使没有浓雾，天也黑了。这时候萨拉要是不得已上阁楼取什么东西，得点上蜡烛。厨房里的那些娘们儿，个个心情不好，脾气坏得不能再坏了。贝基像个小奴隶，被差来遣去，忙得团团转。

“要不是有你，小姐，”有天晚上，贝基爬进阁楼，哑着嗓子，对萨拉说，“要不是有你，有巴士底监狱和隔壁牢房难友这档子故事，我早活不下去了。这儿还真的像监狱一样了，你说是不是？女东家活得越来越像管大牢的头儿，像你说的，我像是看到她带着串大钥匙，那厨娘活像是小牢头。再多讲些听听吧，小姐。给我讲讲咱们在墙根下挖地道的故事吧。”

“我给你讲讲温暖的事吧，”萨拉冷得直哆嗦，“去，把床单拿来，裹在身上。我也裹上，咱俩坐到床上，紧紧挨在一起，我给你讲热带森林的事，那印度绅士的猴子过去就待在那种地方。每当我见那猴子坐在窗前桌子上，一副伤心的模样望着屋面，我敢肯定他的这是在想念热带森林，过去他用尾巴吊住椰子树，一棵棵跳来荡去。不知道逮住他的是哪个人，不知道他离开后，靠他摘回椰子来过活的家人怎么办。”

“这故事听来是暖和些，小姐。”贝基感激地说，“不知咋的，就是巴士底监狱，经你一说，也让人感到暖烘烘的。”

“这是因为你听了想起了别的事，”萨拉说着，把床单往身上裹起来，最后把身子裹得严严实实的，只露出一张黑不溜秋的小脸来，“我早就看出来了。你的身体受苦时，唯一能做的事就是脑子去想别的事儿。”

“你做得到吗，小姐？”贝基疑惑地问，同时用敬佩的目光打量她。

萨拉皱了皱眉毛，但时间不长。

“有时候能做到，有时候做不到。”她答得很坚定，“我做到的时候，心里就舒坦。我相信，咱们都可以做到——只要多试几次就行。最近我就试过好多次了，现在觉得比过去容易多了。每当遇到事儿很可怕——十分可怕的时候——我就尽力去想：我是个公主。我对自己说：‘我是公主，又是小仙女公主，正因为是仙女，什么也伤害不了我，什么也坏不了我的心情。’你不知不觉间就会忘了别的事。”说罢她笑开了。

萨拉有很多时候不得不让自己去想别的事，她也有很多机会证明自己到底是不是公主。不过，有一天，是个非常艰难的日子，她遇到最严峻的考验。事后她每每想起这件事，许多年她也忘不了。

一连下了好几天的雨。街上又冷又滑，寒雾沉沉异常凄凉，到处都是泥泞——黏稠的伦敦泥泞——万物都被细雨和浓雾笼罩起来。自然少不了一些费时又费力的活儿要干——偏又碰上这样的坏天气——萨拉一再被差出去，弄得那一身破旧的衣衫被淋得湿透了。她那顶破帽上插着的几根古怪的旧羽毛显得越发古怪，脚下那双穿烂了的鞋子湿淋淋的，直淌水。这还不算，明卿小姐存心惩罚她，午饭也不让她吃。她饥寒交迫，疲惫不堪，面容憔悴，时不时引得从她身旁路过的好心人突然生起了恻隐之心，忍不住看她一眼。但是她自己没有发觉。她步履匆匆，努力去想别的事儿。这确实很有必要。她用尽了身上的余力去“假装”，去“设想”。但是这一次做起来遇到从未有过的困难。一两次后她发现，这么做事与愿违，反倒感到更冷更饿。但是她顽强地挺着。泥水滋滋地往破鞋子里钻，呼呼的寒风似乎要卷走她身上的薄外衣。她边走边自言自语，声音不高，连嘴唇也没动。

“假设我身上穿的是干燥的衣服，”她想，“假设我脚上穿的是好鞋子，大衣又长又厚，袜子是美利奴羊毛的，还打着大伞。假设——假设，我刚走近卖热面包的铺子时，捡到一枚没主的六便士硬币。假设我真的捡到了，就跑进铺里，买六只热气腾腾的面包，一口气全吃下去。”

在这世界上，有时会发生古里古怪的事。

这古里古怪的事果真让萨拉给撞上了。方才她自言自语时，正要过一条街。街上满是很深的泥水——她得趟过去。她小心翼翼地伸出脚，可还是没少遭罪。不过因为要选路，眼睛得看着脚下，留神别踩着泥浆。就在她低头刚走到人行道时，看到路沟里有样东西在闪闪发亮。分明是一枚银币——一枚被多人踩进沟里的小硬币，而且不失本色，还在闪着银光。不是六便士的，小些，只是四便士的。

眨眼间钱币就到了她那冷冰冰的、冻得又红又紫的小手中。

“哦，”她喘着粗气，说，“真的！是真的！”

你说巧也不巧，接着她抬头看了看正对面的铺子。那居然是间面包铺，只见一个快快活活、壮壮实实、脸蛋红扑扑的慈祥女人正端着一盘刚出炉的圆面包，热气腾腾，香气扑鼻，往橱窗里放——那些面包又大又松，亮光闪闪，上面还缀着一粒粒葡萄干。

精神上的激动，见了面包，加上面包铺地下室窗子飘出来的诱人的香气——凡此种种闹得萨拉一时间几乎要晕过去了。

她知道，这笔钱完全可以心安理得地花掉。显而易见，这枚硬币在泥水浆里肯定躺了有些时间了，街上人来人往，熙熙攘攘，哪里找得到失主？

“不过我得去问问面包铺里那个女人，有没有丢过东西。”她自言自语，有气无力。她过了街，一条湿腿踩到面包铺的台阶上。就在这时候她抬头一看，禁不住停下了脚步。

只见一个小家伙，境况比她还要惨——哪里有人样，简直是一团破布，里面露出一双满是污泥、冻得通红而瘦小的光脚。那小家伙原想把脚也藏进破布里，没奈何，太短了。破布团上是个脑袋，头发乱蓬蓬的，脏脸上凹陷的大眼睛露出饥饿的神色。

萨拉一见这目光就明白对方饿极了，刹那间生出同情心来。

“这孩子，”她叹了口气，说，“是个平民百姓——比我还要饿。”

这孩子——这个平民百姓——抬起头，看了看萨拉，身子朝一旁挪了挪，好让萨拉过去。她已习惯于给人让路了。她知道，一旦被警察发现，就得喝令她：“滚开！”

萨拉手里攥着四便士的钱币，迟疑了数秒钟后，问她：

“你饿了吗？”

小女孩子又挪了挪披着破布的身子。

“咋不饿？”她沙哑着嗓子反问道，“我咋不饿？”

“你吃过中饭没有？”萨拉问。

“啥中饭——”嗓子更哑了，身子又挪了挪，“早饭也没吃——晚饭也是。啥也没吃。”

“多久没吃东西了？”萨拉问。

“不知道——今儿啥也没吃——没处要。要来要去啥也要不到。”

一看她这景况就使萨拉感到越发的饥饿，越发头昏眼花。可是那些古怪的小念头又在她脑子里闹腾开来，虽然她心里非常难受，但还是对自己说起来。

“要是我是公主，”她说道，“要是我是公主，在公主们一贫如洗又被赶下王位——她们也会——跟平民百姓——如果见了比自己更穷更饿的人——她们不会视而不见的。她们总是和别人分享自己的东西。圆面包一便士买一个。如果是枚六便士的硬币，我可以吃上六个。两个人都吃就不够了。不过比起什么都没有要强多了。”

“你等等。”她对小叫花子说。

她进了面包铺。铺内暖和和的，香气扑鼻。老板娘正往橱窗里添热气腾腾的圆面包。

“请问，”萨拉说，“你有没有丢了四便士——四便士的银币？”说罢，她把那枚不起眼的硬币递给了老板娘。

老板娘看了看硬币，又看了看她——看了看那张认真的小脸和那身湿淋淋、原本很讲究的衣衫。

“哦，老天爷，我可没丢！”她答道，“你捡到的？”

“是我捡到的，”萨拉说，“沟里捡到的。”

“那你就留着吧，”老板娘说，“硬币落在那里没准有一个星期了，天知道是哪个丢的。这可没法查。”

“我知道。”萨拉说，“可我寻思得问问你。”

“真不多见。”老板娘脸上同时露出困惑、兴趣和慈祥的神情来。

“你要买些什么？”她一见萨拉在打量圆面包，便问。

“请给四只小圆面包，”萨拉说，“一便士一只的那种。”

老板娘去橱窗，拿了几只面包，装进纸口袋。

萨拉看见她装了六只。

“对不起，我说的是四只。”萨拉解释道，“我只有四便士。”

“加了两只是为了补充分量，”那女的说，露出慈祥的目光，“我敢说，过会儿你准需要吃的。你不是饿了吗？”

萨拉的眼睛湿润了。

“是的，”她说，“我饿了。你这么好心，谢谢你了，再说——”她还想说：“店外还有个孩子比我还要饿。”但是这时候一下子进来两三个顾客，个个都很匆忙似的，她便什么都没说，再次谢了谢老板娘后，出了店门。

那小叫花子还蜷缩着身子待在台阶的一角。她穿着一身又湿又破的衣衫，样子真吓人。她直勾勾地盯着萨拉，目光木然、痛苦。萨拉突然发现自己正用粗糙的脏手背擦着泪水，她似乎挺惊奇的：自己怎么会流起泪来了。她喃喃自语。

萨拉打开纸袋，拿出一只热气腾腾的圆面包。她冰冷的手已被热面包捂暖了些。

“你看，”她说着把面包放到对方裹着破布的膝盖上，“这面包又香又热。吃吧，吃了就不觉得那么饿了。”

那孩子吃了一惊，抬头看了看她，像是想不到有这样的好事让她碰上，令她又惊又怕。接着她一把抓过面包往嘴里塞，饿狼似的大口大口吃了起来。

“哦，老天爷！老天爷！”只听得那孩子欣喜若狂，嘶哑着嗓子喊道，“哦，老天爷！”

萨拉掏出三只面包，递给了她。

她急不可耐地吃着吃着，同时发出嘶哑而怕人的吞咽声。

“她比我饿，”萨拉自言自语道，“她饿坏了。”但是当萨拉递给她第四只面包的时候，手哆嗦起来，“我不算最饿。”她说着——给了她第五只面包。

萨拉临走时，看见那个饿极了的伦敦小野人往嘴里塞面包。她实在饿急了，忙着吃，顾不得说一声“谢谢”。即使她有教养、懂礼貌，到了这地步也顾不上礼貌了，更何况她根本就没受过教育。她只是个可怜的野孩子。

“再见。”萨拉说。

萨拉到了街对面，看见那孩子一手各拿着一只面包。她刚咬了一口，半途停下来，朝萨拉望过去。萨拉轻轻地点了点头，那孩子又盯着她看——神色奇异，盯了好一会儿，接着，那长着乱蓬蓬头发的脑袋晃了一下，算是回礼，直到看不见萨拉后她才重新吃起来，最后把那只咬了一口的面包吃完。

这时候，面包铺老板娘正从橱窗里往外看。

“哎，真想不到！”她高声道，“这小姑娘竟把面包都给了小叫花子！倒不是她不想吃。你瞧瞧，她自己有多饿。我倒是不明白，她这是图个啥。”

她在橱窗后立了好一会儿，寻思着。她很想弄个明白，到底是怎么回事，便来到门口，盘问起小叫花子来。

“面包是哪个给的？”她问。

女孩朝那远去的萨拉背影点了点头。

“她说了什么？”老板娘接着问。

“问我饿不饿？”对方哑着嗓子答道。

“你怎么说？”

“我说咋不饿。”

“后来她进来买了面包，给了你，是不是？”

那孩子点点头。

“给了几只？”

“五只。”

老板娘捉摸了一阵。

“自己只留下一只，”她低声自言自语道，“六只全让她吃也吃得下——从她的眼神看得出。”

她望着那拖着沉重步子远去的身影。她一向活得自自在在，好久不曾烦心过，这时候心里却被搅得不能平静。

“要是她没跑得那么快就好了，”她说，“也真是，当时我怎么就没再给她六只呢？”她说罢转身对着小叫花子。

“你还饿吗？”她问。

“我老觉得饿，”她答道，“可不像刚才那样饿得慌了。”

“进来吧。”老板娘说着推开门。

那孩子站了起来，拖着步子走了进去。被人请进这暖烘烘的地方，里面满是面包，她压根就没想到会有这等好事。她拿不准接着会发生什么事。她也不在乎。

“暖和暖和身子吧。”老板娘指了指里屋狭小房间里的炉火说，“听好了，往后你饿得不行想吃面包时，就上我这儿来要。我这是看在那小姑娘的份上才这么做的，要不就太不像话了。”

吃了剩下的那只面包后，萨拉觉得好过了些。不管怎么说，面包是热的，有吃的比什么没吃强多了。她边走边小块小块地掰下往嘴里送，细嚼慢咽起来，好把时间拖得长些。

“假设这是只有魔法的圆面包，”她说，“一口就抵得上吃一顿美餐，那我这吃法，准要撑死。”

她回到高级女子寄宿学校所在的广场，天已经黑了。家家户户都亮起了灯。她差不多经常能见到“大家庭”一家人的那个房间里，百叶窗还没关上。通常在这时候，她总看到那位被她叫做蒙特莫伦西的先生坐在大椅子里，身边围着一大群小孩子，有说有笑，好不热闹。那些孩子有的坐在椅子两边的扶手上，有的坐在或靠在他的膝盖上。今天晚上，那帮孩子也围着他，可他没坐着。相反，他们个个都很兴奋。看得出来，有人要出远门了。出远门的是蒙特莫伦西先生。门前停着一辆四轮马车，车上捆着旅行用的大皮箱。孩子们围着他蹦蹦跳跳、说说笑笑，闹个不停。那位脸蛋粉红粉红的漂亮母亲立在他身旁说话，像是临别前最后问什么事。萨拉停下脚步，看见他把岁数小的孩子抱起来亲吻一番，然后弯下身吻了吻大点的孩子。

“不知道他外出久不久，”萨拉想道，“皮箱倒是挺大的。啊，他们该多挂念他呀！我也会想念他的，只是他并不知道世上有我这个人。”

大门打开，她就走开了。这时候她想起了那六便士硬币的事。她看见那出远门的人走出来，站在灯光明亮、暖和的大厅前，几个大点的孩子还陪着他。

“莫斯科会是遍地白雪吧？”小姑娘珍妮特问，“是不是到处是冰？”

“你会坐雪橇吗？”另一个孩子问，“你能见到沙皇吗？”

“我全会写信告诉你们的，”他笑着说，“我会寄回一些俄国农夫的画片和别的东西。快进屋。今天晚上又湿又冷。我情愿不去莫斯科，留下来跟你们待在一起。再见了，再见，小宝贝儿！愿上帝保佑你们！”他说罢快步下了台阶，跳进马车。

“找到那个女孩子后，替我们向她问好。”盖伊·克拉伦斯在门前擦鞋垫上又蹦又跳，高声说道。

他们进了屋，关了门。

“看见了吗，”回到房间，珍妮特问诺拉，“那个‘不是叫花子的女孩子’刚走过去？看她又冷又湿的，还扭过头来打量咱们哩。妈妈说，她那衣服像是富人送给她的——人家送给她是因为衣服穿得太破旧了。学校里总在天气最恶劣的时候，不管白天还是黑夜，打发她出去干活。”

且说萨拉，走过广场，到了明卿小姐学校地下室的台阶前，只觉得头昏眼花，浑身哆嗦。

“不知道那姑娘是哪个，”她想道，“那个他们找寻的小姑娘是哪个。”

她拖着篮子走下台阶，只觉得篮子沉甸甸的。这时候，“大家庭”的父亲正匆匆地坐着马车往车站搭乘去莫斯科的火车。到了那里，他要尽全力寻找克鲁上尉失踪的小女儿。





十四　梅基塞代克的所见所闻


萨拉外出办事的那天下午，她的阁楼里发生了件怪事。当时只有梅基塞代克亲眼所见，亲耳所闻，吓得它惊慌失措，大惑不解，忙躲回洞里，不敢出来。它哆哆嗦嗦，胆战心惊，小心翼翼地探出头，想看看到底出了什么事。

大清早萨拉出去后，阁楼里整天是静悄悄的，只有雨点敲打石板瓦和天窗发出的噼啪声才打破了寂静。梅基塞代克觉得很无聊。后来雨声停了，阁楼又恢复了寂静，它决定出来探听探听，虽然凭经验它知道，萨拉一时还回不来。它东溜溜西转转，这儿闻闻，那儿嗅嗅，想不到居然意外地找到一块上顿剩下的面包屑。就在这时候，屋顶有了声响，引起了它的注意。它停下来细听，心头怦怦直跳。这声响说明，窗外屋顶上有什么东西在走动。声响越来越近，快到天窗口了。天窗神秘地打开来，探进一张黝黑的脸，接着后面又露出一张脸。两张脸小小心心、兴致勃勃地朝里面张望。阁楼外屋顶上有两个男人，正准备悄悄爬进来。一个是拉姆·达斯，另一个是年轻人，他是印度绅士的秘书。这些事儿梅基塞代克自然是不知情的。它只知道，这两个人这一来就要打破阁楼的宁静，侵犯人家的隐私。只见长着黑黝黝脸孔的那个人轻巧而敏捷地钻进窗口，悄没声息地落到地板上，梅基塞代克赶忙转身夹着尾巴逃回洞里，吓得它掉了魂儿。跟萨拉一起它已不再害怕了。它知道萨拉除了面包屑，不会朝它扔别的东西，她说起话来始终是低声轻语，和和气气。可这是两个陌生人，跟他们待在一起就危险了。它身子直挺挺地紧贴洞口，一双明亮的眼睛，警惕地透过缝隙朝外张望。那两个人的谈话它到底听懂了多少，我可说不准。不过即使全听懂了，它也许也不明白到底是怎么回事。

那个秘书动作轻巧，年纪轻轻，也像拉姆·达斯一样悄悄地进了天窗，还看到了梅基塞代克奔回洞里来不及藏起的一截尾巴。

“那是老鼠？”他悄声问拉姆·达斯。

“是，是耗子，先生，”拉姆·达斯同样悄声答道，“墙里多着呢。”

“呵！”年轻人大声道，“怪了，这小孩子居然不怕老鼠。”

拉姆·达斯做了个手势。他也轻声地笑了笑。虽然他跟萨拉只说过一次话，但俨然是这里的熟客，对这里了如指掌。

“这孩子小小年纪，跟什么都挺友好，先生。”他说，“她跟别的孩子不一样。我躲在她注意不到我的地方观察了她。好几个晚上，我悄悄溜过石板瓦看她安不安全。我从自己的窗口看她，可她并不知道我就在附近。她常常站在这桌子上，望着窗外的天空，像是天空在跟她说话呢。麻雀听到她的叫唤就飞过来，她寂寞时就喂这耗子，训练它。这家有个可怜的小奴隶经常上她那儿寻求安慰。有个小女娃还悄悄到这儿来。还有一个岁数大点的，可崇拜她了，喜欢听她说话，听了还想听。这都是我悄悄爬过屋顶亲眼看到的。这家的女东家——可是个恶婆娘——拿她当贱民。可她的举止就像是正统的公主！”

“听来你对她很了解。”秘书说。

“她每天怎么过的，我全知情，”拉姆·达斯说，“她什么时候出门，什么时候回来，什么时候高兴，什么时候悲伤，是冷是饿，我全知情。我知道，她孤单时就坐着看书学习；我知道，她的几个秘密朋友什么时候偷偷来看望她，她会变得快活些——小孩子嘛，就是最穷最苦也有快活的时候——因为她们一来，她就跟她们一起低声说说笑笑：要是她病了，我也会知道的，只要办得到，我就过来伺候她。”

“你能肯定，除了她附近不来别的人，能肯定她不会回来撞上我俩。要是被她看见了，会吓坏她，卡里斯福特先生的计划也就完了。”

拉姆·达斯悄无声息地到了门边，紧贴着门站着。

“除了她，没别的人上楼来的，先生，”他说，“她拎着篮子出去了，几小时内回不来。我这就站在这儿，只要有人上来，一踏上最后一段楼梯，我就能听到。”

秘书从胸前口袋里掏出铅笔和记事本。

“注意听着。”他说罢就在小阁楼里轻手轻脚慢慢转起来，一边看东西，一边快速在记事本上记下来。

他先到那只狭小的床前，用手按了按床垫，发出一声惊叹。

“硬得像石头，”他说，“哪天她出门时得换掉，改天得专门过来，今晚来不及了。”他掀开床罩，细看那只单薄的枕头。

“床罩又脏又破，毯子太薄，被单破破烂烂的，满是补丁，”他说，“这样的床怎么让孩子来睡——还是在什么高级女校里！壁炉不知有多少日子没生火了。”他看了看锈迹斑斑的壁炉说。

“我见到它后就没生过火。”拉姆·达斯说，“这里的女东家，除了她自己，从来就想不到别人也会冷的。”

秘书在本本上飞快地写起来。写完了，抬起头，撕下一页，塞回胸前口袋里。

“这事儿做得挺别致，”他说，“哪个想出来的？”

拉姆·达斯谦恭地深深鞠了一躬。

“说实话，最初是我的主意，先生，”他说，“那只是我凭空瞎想一气。我太喜欢这孩子了，我跟她都是孤零零的。她就爱跟自己的朋友说自己的梦想。有天晚上，我心里难受，就躺在开着的天窗边听她讲。在她的想象中，要是这简陋的阁楼里摆上舒适的家具，会是个什么模样。她说着说着，就像真的出现在眼前，她越说越高兴。结果她提到了这么个怪想法。第二天老爷病了，心情也不好，我给他讲了这事好让他开开心。说来只是个梦想，可老爷听了挺高兴。小姑娘的事儿让他心情好起来。他对小姑娘来了兴趣，还问了我一些情况。最后他要让她的梦想成真，也好让自己开开心。”

“你以为在她睡着的时候这事办得成？要是她醒过来怎么办？”秘书提出自己的看法。显而易见，不管这计划具体是什么，这件事激发了他的兴致，并像卡里斯福特先生一样感到快乐。

“我移动起来脚步轻如鹅毛，无声无息，”拉姆·达斯说，“再说小孩子一向睡得熟——即使是苦命的孩子也一样。我可以做到一个晚上来来去去好多次，让她睡得熟熟的，身子一动不动。要是让另一个人把东西从窗口递给我，我可以做到一丝一毫也不惊动她。她醒来后，还以为是魔法师来过呢。”

他微微一笑，像是他那白袍下的心也感到了温暖，秘书也报之一笑。

“这像是《天方夜谭》里的故事，”他说，“这主意只有东方人才想得出来。浓雾下的伦敦人可没这能耐。”

好在他俩没待多久，让梅基塞代克大大舒了口气，它可能听不懂两个人的这番谈话，但是总觉得他们鬼鬼祟祟的举动和窃窃私语不是个好兆头。那年轻的秘书像是对什么事都感兴趣——地板、壁炉、破板凳、旧桌子，还有墙壁什么的，他全记下来——最后还用手在墙壁上摸来摸去，发现上面钉了许多旧钉子，还挺高兴哩。

“上面可以挂东西。”他说。

拉姆·达斯神秘地笑了笑。

“昨天，她出去时，”他说，“我进来，带了一些尖尖的小钉子，不用锤子就能摁到墙上。我在墙上钉了不少，需要时准能派上用场。”

印度绅士的秘书一动不动地站着，朝四周又看了看，把小本本塞回了口袋里。

“看来记下不少了。我们可以走了。”他说，“卡里斯福特先生有副热心肠，千遗憾、万遗憾就是没能把那丢失的孩子找回来。”

“要是找回那孩子，他一准会身强体壮起来。”拉姆·达斯说，“他的上帝早晚会领她回到他身边的。”

接着他们像进来时那样，悄悄地无声无息钻出了天窗。梅基塞代克吃准了他俩真的走了后，心上一块大石头这才落了地。过了几分钟，它觉得已万无一失，便从洞里钻出来，跑来跑去，指望着那两个叫人好不提心吊胆的人没准口袋里装了面包屑，掉落出来，让它碰上一些。





十五　魔法


萨拉经过隔壁邻居家时，看见拉姆·达斯正在关百叶窗，同时也看了一眼里面的房间。

“好久了，我都没有好好看过这样漂亮的房间了。”她的脑海里闪过这样的想法。

壁炉里照例生着熊熊炉火，印度绅士坐在炉前。他一手托着头，看起来还是那样孤苦和忧伤。

“可怜的人儿，”萨拉说，“我真想知道你脑子里在想什么。”此时此刻，他想的是：

“假如，”他在想，“假如卡迈克尔寻找那些人一直到了莫斯科——那个从巴黎帕斯克尔夫人学校领走的女孩并不是我们要找的人；假如结果证明她完全是另一个孩子。那接下去该采取什么措施呢？”

萨拉进了学校，遇到了明卿小姐。她下楼来刚训斥过厨娘。

“你倒是到哪儿瞎混了？”她问，“你这一出去可有好几个小时了。”

“外面又湿又冷，”萨拉答道，“路很难走，因为我的鞋子太破，老打滑。”

“别找借口，”明卿小姐说，“也别说瞎话。”

萨拉进去来到厨娘跟前。厨娘刚挨了重重的教训，正在气头上，巴不得有个出气筒，照例她把怒气全发到萨拉身上。

“你干吗不待在外面过夜？”她怒气冲冲地喝问。

萨拉把买回的东西放到桌子上。

“就这些。”她说。

厨娘看了看，嘴里嘟嘟哝哝个不停。这时她正在火头上。

“能不能让我吃些东西？”萨拉有气无力地问。

“早过了下午茶的时间，再说也没剩下什么东西了。”听到的就是这样的回答，“你敢情指望我温好给你留着？”

好一会儿萨拉一声不吭地立着。

“连中饭我都没吃过。”接着她回答了这一句，且声音很低。声音低是她怕说响了会发颤。

“柜子里还有点面包，”厨娘说，“都什么时候了，你只能吃这些。”

萨拉过去找到面包。面包很不新鲜，又硬又干。厨娘还在气头上，是不会给她别的东西就着面包吃的。把气撒在萨拉头上最保险，也最容易。是呀，让一个孩子去爬三层长梯到阁楼去可不容易。累的时候，她觉得这楼梯又长又陡，今晚更觉得楼梯没有尽头似的。有几次她爬着爬着，得停下来歇一歇。她终于到了楼梯顶，高兴地看到房间门缝下透出一道微光，这说明埃芒加德已经上楼来看望她了。这对她来说也是一大安慰。总比一个人孤孤单单进了房，面对一个空荡荡、冷清清的房间强得多。单有这个裹着红披巾、胖嘟嘟、让人看了舒坦的埃芒加德，人也觉得暖和些。

可不是，萨拉一进去就看到埃芒加德在。只见她坐在床中央，为了安全起见，把两条腿盘了起来。虽说埃芒加德很喜欢梅基塞代克和它的家人，可怎么也无法与它们交上朋友。每当阁楼里只有她一个人的时候，她情愿坐在床上等萨拉回来。这一次她真的被搅得心神不宁了。梅基塞代克出来过，到处闻闻嗅嗅，有一次还身子直挺挺地坐在后腿上，眼盯着她，朝她这个方向嗅个不停，吓得她禁不住小声尖叫起来。

“啊，萨拉，”她嚷道，“见到你回来，可把我乐坏了。梅尔切老嗅个不停，我想哄它回洞，可它就是不听，老待着不走。你是知道的，我喜欢它，可一看见它对着我嗅，我心里就发毛。你说它会不会跳上来？”

“不会。”萨拉答道。

埃芒加德身子往前探了探，打量萨拉。

“你真的累坏了，”她说，“瞧你脸色多苍白。”

“我是累了，”萨拉说罢一屁股坐到那条歪歪斜斜的矮凳上，“你瞧，梅基塞代克来了，可怜的东西。他这是找晚饭呢。”

梅基塞代克大概是听到萨拉的脚步声才出洞的。萨拉认准这耗子熟悉她的脚步声。它带着亲昵、期待的神情跑过来，可是萨拉将手伸进口袋，把里子翻了出来，直摇头。

“太对不起了，”她说，“连面包屑也没留下。回家吧，梅基塞代克，跟你妻子说，我口袋空空的。恐怕我把这事给忘了，因为厨娘和明卿小姐在大发脾气呢。”

梅基塞代克像是听明白了。它虽然不甘心，还是乖乖地打道回府了。

“没想到今晚你能来，厄米。”萨拉说。

埃芒加德把身上的红披巾裹得更紧些。

“艾米丽亚小姐今晚去她老姨妈家不回来了，”她道出了原委，“我们上床后，再也没人来查房了。只要我愿意，可以在这儿待到天亮。”

她指了指天窗下的桌子。萨拉进房时没注意，只见桌子上堆了些书。埃芒加德做了个懊恼的姿势。

“爸爸又给我寄书了，萨拉，”她说，“你瞧，全在那儿。”

萨拉转身立刻站起来。她奔了过去，从桌子上拿起最上面的书，飞快地翻了起来。一时间她把自己的苦恼抛到了九霄云外。

“啊，”她喊了起来，“多好呀！卡莱尔的《法国革命》。我一直想读这本书呢。”

“我可不想读，”埃芒加德说，“爸爸要是知道我不读准会生气的。放假回家他准会问我这书讲了些啥。你看我该怎么办？”

萨拉不再翻书了，看了看她，这时的萨拉激动得双颊红通通的。

“听我说，”她大声道，“要是你把书全借给我，让我来读——过后我就把书的内容全讲给你听——这样你也记住了。”

“天哪，太好了！”埃芒加德高声道，“可你认为这办得到吗？”

“我想办得到。”萨拉答道，“那些小家伙不是把我讲的故事全记住了吗？”

“萨拉，”埃芒加德看到了希望，她的圆脸熠熠生辉，“要是你办得到，我就——我就送你东西。”

“别的东西我不想要，”萨拉说，“我想要书——这些书！”她说着睁大了眼睛，胸脯一起一伏的。

“那就拿去吧，”埃芒加德说，“我可不想要，要是我也想要就好了。我这人不聪明，可我爸爸聪明。他以为我也应该聪明。”

萨拉一本一本地翻着书。“你打算跟你爸爸怎么说？”她心里出现一丝疑虑，便问。

“用不着让他知道，”埃芒加德答道，“只要让他知道书我读过就得了。”

萨拉放下书，慢慢地摇了摇头。“那不等于说谎吗？”她说，“说谎——你知道，不单可恶，而且卑劣。有时候——”她想了想，接着说，“我也想过会不会做出可恶的事来——知道吗，没准在明卿小姐虐待我时，一气之下宰了她，可我不能做个卑劣的人。为什么你不告诉你爸爸说书是我读的？”

“他要我来读。”埃芒加德想不到好端端的突然会变成这样，觉得有些泄气。

“他希望你知道这些书的内容，”萨拉说，“要是我用简单的办法讲给你听，让你记住，我想他会高兴的。”

“不管用什么办法，只要我学到了，他是会高兴的。”埃芒加德说，“要是你是我爸爸，你也会高兴的。”

“那不能怪你，要是——”萨拉说了半句，停住了。她原想说：“那不能怪你，要是你生来就笨。”

“‘要是’什么？”埃芒加德问。

“要是你学起东西来不够快。”萨拉改口说，“要是你学不会，就承认学不会——要是我行，可不是，我就行。就这么回事。”

她一向呵护埃芒加德，不让她明显地觉得自己跟别人相差很远，人家一学就会，可她不能。一见对方那胖胖的脸蛋，萨拉就产生一些聪明而老派的想法。

“没准，”她说，“脑子灵不能说明一切。有颗善良的心对别人才有价值。即使明卿小姐无所不知，无所不能，可她的为人还是没变，她仍然是个讨人厌的货色，人见人恨。世上多少聪明人尽干坏事，作恶多端。就拿罗伯斯庇尔来说吧——”

她没有说下去，看到埃芒加德脸上出现疑惑不解的神情。“你忘了吧？”她说，“不久前我就跟你说起过他的事。相信你准是忘了。”

“可不是，我一点儿也想不起来了。”埃芒加德坦白承认。

“得，你等会儿，”萨拉说，“让我把湿衣服脱了，裹上床单，重新给你说说。”

她脱下帽子和外衣，挂在墙上的钉子上，换掉湿鞋子，穿上旧拖鞋，然后跳上床，拉过床单紧紧护住双肩，坐下来，两手抱住膝盖。

“听我说。”她道。

她全身心投入到那血淋淋的法国大革命中，讲起有关故事来。讲着，讲着，听得埃芒加德紧张地睁大眼睛，大气也不敢出。虽说埃芒加德感到胆战心惊，但听来又兴奋又激动，从此大概不会把罗伯斯庇尔给忘了，也不会记不起朗巴尔亲王夫人的事儿了。

“你知道吧，他们把她的头挑在长矛上，围着跳舞。”萨拉高声说道，“她可是长着一头漂亮的金色长发。可是在我的头脑中，她的脑袋不是长在肩膀上，而是挑在长矛上，而那些狂怒的暴民围着她又是跳又是嚷的。”

后来，两个人说好，把自己的打算告诉圣·约翰先生，这些书暂时留在阁楼里。

“接着咱们来谈谈各自的情况吧。”萨拉说，“你的法语学得怎么样了？”

“自从上次我来阁楼你给我讲了动词的变位后好多了。第二天上午，明卿小姐见我的练习做得这么好，都惊呆了。”

萨拉听了双手抱住膝盖，微微一笑。

“同样，她怎么也搞不明白，洛蒂的加法练习怎么做得那么好，”她说，“那是因为洛蒂偷偷溜到这儿来，我帮了她。”她环顾四周，“要是这阁楼不这么寒酸，变一变，那就好了。”她说着又笑了起来，“这里可是个‘假装’的好地方哩。”

事实是，埃芒加德根本不知道，阁楼里的生活有时候有令人无法忍受的一面，而且她的想象力也不丰富，不足以清晰地想象得出，那是一幅怎样的图景。她很少来萨拉的阁楼，在为数不多的场合，她看到的只是另一面，因“假装”或给自己讲的故事而激起的令人兴奋的一面。她来这里往往带有冒险性质。虽然有时候萨拉脸色不好，人也明显地日见消瘦，但她那高傲的幼小心灵却不容许她向他人抱怨叫屈。她从未向别人吐露过自己，有时候像今晚一样，饿得头昏眼花。她的身体在迅速发育，又不断在外奔波，即使得到正常的丰盛而富有营养的食物，她也是容易饿的，更何况食无定时，在厨房里碰到什么就吃什么，而且都是些难以下咽的粗劣食物。小小年纪的她，已慢慢地习惯于饥肠辘辘的境况了。

“想起来，士兵在艰难的长途行军中一定也是这样的感觉。”她经常对自己说。她喜欢“艰难的长途行军”的说法，听起来别有一番感受，令她觉得自己就像是个士兵。此外，她还有一种奇怪的感觉，自己俨然是阁楼的主人。

“要是我生活在城堡里，”她发起了议论，“而埃芒加德是另一座城堡的贵妇人，来拜访我，大群骑士、侍卫、仆从骑着马前呼后拥，旌旗飘飘；我听到吊桥外的号角声便下楼迎接，然后在大宴会厅大摆筵席，请来艺人唱歌、演戏，吟咏传奇故事。她来阁楼，我虽无法设宴款待，但可以给她讲故事，不让她看到、听到伤心的事。我敢说，倒运的城堡主遇到领地被人掠夺而闹饥荒的年头，也只能这样做了。”她就是这样一位高傲勇敢的小城堡主，慷慨地倾其所有来款待来客——这些就是她做的梦——她想象中的幻景——给她带来快乐和慰藉的幻景。

因此，当两个人坐在一起时，埃芒加德并不知道，萨拉这时饿得头昏眼花，也不知道萨拉跟她说话时，时不时担心自己——若是她一人待着会不会饿得不能入睡。她觉得自己从未这样饿过。

“我真希望自己像你一样苗条，萨拉，”埃芒加德突然说道，“我相信你比过去更瘦了。你的眼睛看起来老大老大，瞧你的胳膊肘，尖骨头都突出来了。”

萨拉硬是把短得缩上去的袖子往下拉。

“我一向就瘦，”她要强地说，“我的眼睛一向又绿又大。”

“你的眼睛怪怪的，我喜欢。”埃芒加德死死地盯着那双眼睛看起来，显得又爱慕又深情，“这样的眼睛大概能看得老远老远。我喜欢——我也喜欢那绿莹莹的颜色——不过有时候看起来是黑色的。”

“这可是猫眼，”萨拉笑着说，“只是黑暗中看不清东西——我试过，可就是看不清。我倒是希望能看清。”

就在这时候天窗外有了动静，只是她俩没有注意到。要是她俩有个人恰好回转头看看，准会被一张黝黑的脸吓一跳，因为那脸小心翼翼朝房间里张望一阵儿，又像出现时一样迅速而悄无声息地消失了。但并非完全的悄无声息，是差不多。萨拉的耳朵很灵，猛地侧过身，抬头看了看屋顶。

“不像是梅基塞代克搞出来的声音，”她说，“不大像是爪子的抓挠声。”

“什么？”埃芒加德吃了一惊，忙问。

“你没听到什么声响吗？”萨拉问。

“没——没有，”埃芒加德说，声音有点发颤，“你听到了？”

“也许没什么，”萨拉说，“只是我觉得好像听到了什么。石板瓦上像是有什么声响——轻轻拖动的声音。”

“倒是什么呢？”埃芒加德说，“不会是贼吧？”

“不是，”萨拉刚说到，“这里没什么好偷的——”

话说到半句，她猛地停了下来。这时两个人都听到声响，使萨拉没有说下去。不是从石板瓦上来，而是楼下传上来的，是明卿小姐的怒骂声。萨拉立即跳下床，吹灭了蜡烛。

“她在骂贝基。”萨拉立在黑暗中说，“骂得她哭了。”

“她会上这儿来吗？”埃芒加德吓得慌了神，轻声问。

“不会。她以为我睡了。你可别闹出声响来。”

明卿小姐难得愿意爬上高高的楼梯到这里来。萨拉记得她只来过一次。可现在她正大发雷霆，至少已上了几级楼梯了。听起来她像是推着贝基上来的。

“你这不要脸、尽说瞎话的小东西，”她俩听到她在骂，“厨娘跟我说了，她那里老丢东西。”

“我没拿，东家，”贝基抽抽搭搭道，“我是饿坏了，可我没拿——从来没拿！”

“该让你下大牢，”是明卿小姐的声音，“又是拿又是偷的！整整一大半肉饼，整整一大半！”

“可我没拿，”贝基哭哭啼啼道，“就是整只我也吃得下——可我连一个手指也没碰过。”

明卿小姐发着火，加上爬着楼梯，害得她气喘吁吁起来。肉饼原是为她准备的夜宵。听得出，她在抽贝基的耳光。

“别对我撒谎，”她说，“这就滚回自己的房间。”

萨拉和埃芒加德都听到“啪啪”的耳光声，听到贝基拖着那双破鞋往楼梯上奔，进了自己的阁楼，听到她关上门，猜到她一头扑到了床上。

“两只我也吃得下，”她俩听到贝基闷在枕头上哭着，“可我一口也没咬，是厨娘拿去给了跟她相好的警察。”

黑暗中萨拉站在阁楼中间，她紧咬牙关，一双伸出的小拳头愤怒地攥紧又松开。她几乎无法这么静静地站下去了，但是直到明卿小姐下了楼，四周又变得静悄悄的，她才敢挪动身子。

“恶毒、残忍的东西！”她破口骂了起来，“厨娘自己拿了东西，反说是贝基偷的。她不会！她不会偷的！她有时饿极了去垃圾桶里捡干面包皮吃！”她的双手紧紧捂住脸，动情地小声哭起来，埃芒加德听到这不寻常的声音惊得目瞪口呆。萨拉在哭！这不屈不挠的萨拉！这似乎意味着出现新情况——一种她过去不懂的心情。假设是！假设是！她那善良而迟钝的心突然想到可能出现一种陌生而可怕的情况。黑暗中，她悄悄爬下床，摸到了放着蜡烛的桌子，划上火柴，点亮了蜡烛。接着，她凑上前，打量萨拉，目光流露出的是新的想法引起的恐惧。

“萨拉，”她战战兢兢、惶恐不安地问，“你——你——你从来没跟我说过——我不想得罪人，可——你是不是挨过饿？”

此时此刻，既然已到这地步，已被一语道破，无需隐忍，萨拉拿开手，抬起头。

“是的，”她用一种全新的口吻，动情地说，“是的，我饿。现在我非常饿，饿得能吃下你。听到可怜的贝基刚才的遭遇，我更难受了。她比我还要饿呀。”

埃芒加德喘着粗气。

“哦，哦！”她伤心得哭喊起来，“我压根被蒙在鼓里！”

“我本不想让你知道，”萨拉说，“这会让我觉得自己是大街上的叫花子。我知道自己这模样跟叫花子一个样了。”

“不，你不像——你一丁点儿也不像！”埃芒加德抢过了话头，“你的衣服有点儿怪——可你不可能像大街上的叫花子。你的脸跟他们完全不一样。”

“有一次有个男孩施舍我一枚六便士硬币，”萨拉说，禁不住“扑嗤”笑出声来，“就是这枚。”她说着，从脖子上拉出细带来，“要不是他看出我需要钱，不会把自己圣诞节得到的六便士给了我。”

这枚六便士硬币多多少少让她俩的心情好了些。虽说她俩的眼睛还噙着泪花，但还是笑了一阵子。

“他是哪个？”埃芒加德问，眼看着钱币，仿佛那不是枚普通的硬币。

“他是个可爱的小孩，正去参加聚会，”萨拉说，“是‘大家庭’的一员，岁数最小的，圆圆的小腿儿——我管他叫盖伊·克拉伦斯。在我的想象中，他的儿童室里满是圣诞礼物，食品篮里塞满糕点和别的东西，他看得出，我啥也没有。”

埃芒加德稍稍往后跳了一步。最后那几句话提醒了她，烦恼中突然想到一个主意。

“哦，萨拉！”她嚷嚷道，“瞧我多蠢，怎么就忘得一干二净。”

“忘了什么？”

“好东西！”埃芒加德激动得忙不迭地说道，“就在今儿下午，我那最最好的姨妈给我寄来一盒东西，塞得满满的，尽是好吃的东西。我碰也没碰，因为晚饭时我布丁吃得太多了，加上爸爸那些书让我烦透了。”说着说着，她变得语无伦次了，“里面有蛋糕，有肉馅小饼，有果酱烤饼和圆面包，还有橘子、红浆果酒、无花果和巧克力。我这就偷偷回房间拿了来。咱们过会儿就吃。”

萨拉几乎快要晕过去了。一个人要是饿昏了，一提起吃的东西来往往会产生奇特的影响。她捏紧埃芒加德的胳膊。

“你认为——你行吗？”她脱口问道。

“我知道。我行，”埃芒加德说罢，向门口奔去——轻轻打开门——黑暗中探出头听了听，然后回到萨拉身边，“灯都灭了。大伙都睡了。我可以偷偷摸摸——偷偷摸摸地去，谁也听不见。”

这事让人太高兴了。两个人紧握住对方的手。萨拉的眼睛突然一亮。

“厄米！”她说，“咱们假装一次。就假装这是一次宴会！我说，隔壁牢房那个难友也请了来不是更好吗？”

“好主意！好主意！这就去敲墙。牢房头子不会听见的。”

萨拉来到墙前，听到墙那边贝基还在哭，哭声比刚才轻了些。她敲了四下。

“敲四下就是告诉她：‘通过墙下密道上我这儿来。’”她解释道，“‘有事相告。’”

很快就听到敲击声：回了五下。

“她这就来了。”她说。

说话间阁楼的门被打开，贝基走了进来。她的眼睛通红通红的，便帽滑到一边。她一见埃芒加德便慌忙用围裙擦了擦脸。

“有我在，你千万别在意，贝基。”埃芒加德大声道。

“是埃芒加德小姐请你过来，”萨拉说，“她这就给咱们拿一盒好东西来。”

这下贝基的便帽差不多从头上掉下来了，这是因为她太高兴了。

“吃的东西？”她问，“好吃的东西？”

“可不是，”萨拉回答道，“咱们这就假装开个宴会。”

“你可以放开肚皮吃，”埃芒加德插言道，“我这就去拿。”

她踮着脚尖匆匆跑了，跑得太急，连红披巾掉了也没发觉。一时间别人也没留意。贝基想不到遇上这样的好运，自然是喜不自禁。

“啊，小姐！啊，小姐！”她喘着粗气说，“我知道是你要她让我过来的。这事儿——这事儿让我一想起来忍不住就哭。”她走到萨拉的身旁，站着，用崇敬的目光打量起来。

萨拉的眼睛虽然还透着饥色，但已开始闪出原先的光彩，她周围的世界跟着起了变化。就在这个阁楼里——室外是寒夜，下午在泥泞的街道上跋涉的景象还历历在目，而那小叫花子令人恐惧的饥饿眼神仍记忆犹新——像施了魔法，居然出现这件平凡而令人兴奋的事。

她屏住了呼吸。

“反正，”她高声道，“到了最糟糕的时刻就会出现转机，像是施了魔法。这道理我应该始终牢记在心。天无绝人之路。”

她高高兴兴地轻轻摇了摇贝基。

“别哭，别哭！你不该哭！”她说，“咱们赶紧把桌子布置好。”

“布置好桌子吗，小姐？”贝基巡视一番房间，说，“拿什么布置？”

萨拉也跟着环顾房间。

“看来是没有多少东西。”她微微一笑答道。

说话间她看到一样东西，忙扑了过去。地板上摊着埃芒加德掉下的红披巾。

“瞧这红披巾，”她高声道，“我知道她不会计较的。正好用来做红台布，可漂亮了。”

两个人拉来旧桌子，铺上红披巾。红色是一种奇妙的色彩，让人看了舒服。看上去房间显得像模像样了。

“地板上要是铺上地毯就漂亮多了！”萨拉大声道，“咱们就假装铺着一块！”

她用赞许的目光匆匆打量一眼那光秃秃的地板。地板上就铺上地毯了。

“多柔软，多厚实啊！”她微微一笑。贝基明白这一笑的含义，便故意抬起腿，又踩了下去，脚下仿佛真的触到了什么。

“可不是吗，小姐。”贝基显得兴奋异常，认认真真地打量对方。她一向就是认真的。

“接着干什么？”萨拉一动不动站着，双手捂住眼睛，说，“只要我想想，等会儿，就会有办法的。”她的声音很轻，带着期待，“魔法会告诉我的。”

她最喜欢的一种幻想就是：“外面的”——用她的说法——种种想法等着人们召唤。过去贝基多次看到她站着等待，也知道用不了几秒钟她就会放下手，露出灿烂的笑容。

果真如此。

“好呀！”她喊道，“有了！我知道了！该翻翻当年我当公主时用过的那只旧箱子。”

她奔到放箱子的屋角，跪了下去。箱子并非为她着想，而是因为没有地方摆放才留在那儿的。箱子里只是些破烂货。但是她知道总能找到些有用的东西。魔法总有种种办法遂人心愿的。

箱内一角有只小包，很不起眼，引不起人的注意。当时她看到了就当作纪念品留了下来。包内有一打白色小手绢。她喜出望外，抓起来跑回桌前，开始在红台布上一一摆放起来。她又拍又揉，把手绢折起来，让卷曲的窄窄花边露在外面，这不是魔法显灵吗？

“这些是盘子，”她说，“是金色的盘子。这些是漂亮的绣花餐巾。出自西班牙修道院修女之手。”

“真的吗，小姐？”贝基听了精神为之一振，轻声问道。

“你得假装是这样，”萨拉说，“要是你认真假装，就会看到真的是那样。”

“说得不错，小姐。”贝基说。萨拉又到了箱前，全神贯注，希望完全达到自己的目标。

萨拉转过身来，冷不防发现贝基站在桌旁，显得十分古怪。见她闭着双眼，扭曲着脸，怪模怪样，而双手僵直地悬在两侧，紧捏拳头，看上去她像是在使劲地举着又大又重的东西。

“怎么回事，贝基？”她大声问，“你这是干什么？”

贝基吓了一跳，睁开眼睛。

“我这是在‘假装’哩，小姐，”她答道，显得有点不好意思，“我学你的样，想看到些东西。我差点看到了。”她满怀希望地笑了笑，“可做起来够费劲的。”

“也许是你还不习惯，才感到费劲，”萨拉说，流露出亲切而同情的神色，“可你不知道，只要经常练，做起来就非常容易了。我开始的时候也不愿意太费劲。过一阵子你就会得心应手的。我会告诉你都是些什么东西。瞧这些。”

只见她手里拿着一顶旧太阳帽，是从箱底掏出来的。帽子上有一圈花饰。她拆下花饰。

“这便是宴会上用的花环，”她郑重其事地说，“有了这些花环就满室飘香。脸盆架上有只大水杯，贝基。哦——把那只肥皂盒拿过来，可以摆在餐桌中央当装饰物。”

贝基恭恭敬敬地把她说的东西一一递给她。

“这些又是啥，小姐？”她问，“敢情你认为是陶瓷吧——可我看不是。”

“这是雕花酒壶，”萨拉说着在水杯四周装点上花饰的卷须，“而这个，”她说着，弯身在肥皂盒里放上玫瑰花，“是件镶着宝石、用纯净的雪花石膏做的。”

她轻轻地抚摸着这些东西，嘴边挂着丝丝笑意，使她出落得像是梦幻中的人儿。

“天哪，真叫漂亮！”贝基悄声道。

“要是有东西来做糖果碟子就好了，”萨拉喃喃道，“有了！”她又朝箱子奔去，“想起来了，刚才我见到一样东西。”

那是一团用红白两色薄纸包起来的羊毛，薄纸很快就被她卷成小碟的模样，再用剩下的花儿一起便做成了烛台，这下宴会上照明的烛台就不缺了。要是没有魔法，单凭一条红披巾和很久未被打开的箱子里翻出来的那些破烂货哪能装点出这等排场来？萨拉后退一步，审视了一番，看到眼前出现的种种奇迹。贝基呢，她高高兴兴地打量了之后，压低声音，问：

“这里，”她环顾阁楼，问，“现在是巴士底监狱——还是变成了别的完全不一样的地方？”

“可不是，对了，说对了！”萨拉道，“完全变样了，变成宴会厅了！”

“老天爷，小姐！”贝基失声喊了起来，“你是说全铺上毯子了？”她转过身看着这辉煌的场面，又敬畏又疑惑。

“是宴会厅，”萨拉说，“一个举行宴会的大厅。有拱形屋顶，有乐队演出的舞台，还有个大壁炉，里面满是烧得旺旺的橡木段，四面八方点着细蜡烛，照得满屋雪亮。”

“老天爷，萨拉小姐！”贝基惊得又喘着粗气。

这时房门开了，埃芒加德走了进来。篮子太重，压得她走起路来踉踉跄跄。她一见这场面兴奋之余吃了一惊。室外又冷又黑，进来后，想不到眼前出现这么排场的餐桌，铺着红红的桌布，装点着雪白的餐巾，花环点缀其间，不由觉得她们的准备工作做得实在到家。

“哦，萨拉！”她惊呼道，“我从来没见过像你这样聪明绝顶的女孩！”

“漂亮吧？”萨拉说，“全是我从旧箱子里掏出来的东西。我请魔法帮忙，它让我过去到箱子里找找。”

“我说，小姐，”贝基嚷道，“你倒是听她说说都是啥玩意儿！那可不是一般——哦，小姐，你就跟她说说吧。”她求起萨拉来了。

于是萨拉就一五一十全对埃芒加德说了。在魔法的帮助下，萨拉让对方听了后几乎全都信以为真：金色的盘子——拱形屋顶——熊熊燃烧的橡木段——闪闪发光的细蜡烛。食物从篮子里取了出来：撒着糖霜的蛋糕——水果——糖果和酒——这一切摆上后，这宴席便显得十分丰盛气派了。

“跟真的宴会一模一样！”埃芒加德大声道。

“女王摆下的宴会也不过如此。”贝基赞叹道。

埃芒加德心血来潮，忽发奇想。

“快听我说，萨拉，”她说，“现在你就假装自己是公主，这就成了皇家的御宴了。”

“可你才是宴会的主人，”萨拉说，“公主该是你，我俩是你的侍从女官。”

“我不行，”埃芒加德说，“我太胖了，再说我也不懂那些规矩，还是你来当公主吧。”

“好吧，要是你要我来当。”萨拉说。

突然，她想起了别的什么事，便转身向锈迹斑斑的火炉奔了过去。

“这里塞满了纸和垃圾，”她大声道，“要是点上火，烧起来能照亮几分钟，咱们就会觉得真的有炉火了。”她划上火柴，生上炉子，顿时房间被照得亮堂堂的。

“不过，炉火一灭，”萨拉说，“咱们就会记不起真的有过炉火了。”

她立在跳跃的火焰前笑着。

“看上去不是跟真的一样吗？”她说，“入席吧。”

她领着两个小姑娘走到桌子前，风度翩翩地向埃芒加德和贝基摆摆手。这时的萨拉正沉醉在梦幻之中。

“请过来吧，各位美丽的淑女，”她用快乐的梦幻般的声音说，“请来宴会桌前就座吧。我高贵的父王出巡在外，命我代为宴请各位。”说到这里，她把头微微转向房间的一角。“嗨，乐师们！奏起六弦琴，吹起巴松管吧。但凡公主，”她向埃芒加德和贝基解释了起来，“每逢举行宴会都请乐师演奏。咱们就假装那个角落里有个乐师座了。好，现在开始吧。”

三个人刚伸手拿到蛋糕-——没人有进一步的举动，突然都跳了起来，脸孔发白，转向门口——竖起耳朵听了起来——听了起来。

有人上楼来了。真真切切，有人来了。三个人都听得出那怒气冲冲上楼来的脚步声，知道：现在全完了。

“来的是——是女东家。”贝基吓得几乎说不出话来，手中的蛋糕跟着掉了下来。

“是她，”萨拉道，那苍白的小脸上一双眼睛惊惶中变得老大老大，“给明卿小姐发现了。”

明卿小姐一拳敲开门。她脸色煞白，不过是发怒引起的。她看了看三张惊慌失色的脸，再看了看宴会桌，转而看了看炉子里纸张最后的余光。

“我早就怀疑上会有这等事了，”她嚷嚷道，“可做梦也没想到会出现如此大胆妄为的举动。拉维尼亚的报告句句属实。”

如此说来是拉维尼亚，不知怎么的被她看破了秘密，并告发了她们。明卿小姐大步来到贝基跟前，再次扇了她一记耳光。

“你这不要脸的小畜生！”她嚷道，“明天一早你就给我走人！”

萨拉一动不动地站着，眼睛睁得更大，脸色变得更白。埃芒加德泪如雨下。

“哦，别撵她走，”她抽抽泣泣道，“这一篮吃的是我姨妈送的。我们只是——只是在举行聚会。”

“我看到了，”明卿小姐挖苦起来，“萨拉公主坐的是首席。”她转身，怒气冲冲地对着萨拉，“我知道，全是你干的好事。”她大声嚷道，“这种事埃芒加德想不出来。想来桌子上的破烂货——也是你布置上的。”她又朝贝基跺跺脚，“回你的阁楼！”她一声令下，贝基用围裙掩着脸，抽抽噎噎，悄悄走了。

下个目标自然轮到了萨拉。

“看我明天的厉害，早饭、中饭、晚饭全不让你吃！”

“今天我没吃中饭，也没吃上晚饭，明卿小姐。”萨拉说，她早已有气无力了。

“那就更好。好让你长点记性。别这么待着，快把这些东西装回篮子里去。”

她自己动手把桌子上的东西扫进了篮子，并一眼见到埃芒加德的那些新书。

“你——”她这是对埃芒加德说，“竟把自己漂亮的新书拿到这肮脏的阁楼里来。都捡起来，回去睡觉去。明儿整天不让你出房门，我给你爸爸写信。要是知道你今晚待在什么地方，看他怎么说！”

这时候她看到萨拉那阴沉而专注的目光，觉得不对劲，便怒气冲冲转向她。

“你在想什么来着？”她问，“你为什么这样看着我？”

“我在想。”萨拉像在那难忘的一天，在教室里那样回答道。

“想什么？”

这场面跟那天在教室的一模一样。萨拉的一举一动毫无无礼之处，见到的只是悲哀和沉默。

“我在想，”她说得很轻，“要是我爸爸知道今晚我在什么地方，看他会说些什么。”

明卿小姐又像上次那样怒不可遏，也和上次一样任其发泄出来。她扑过去，摇晃萨拉的身子。

“你这个无法无天、放肆的东西！”她嚷嚷道，“你怎么敢这样！怎么敢这样！”

她捡起书，把剩下来的吃食一股脑儿往篮子里扫，又一把塞到埃芒加德怀里，把她推向门口。

“我就让你一个人待着想你的。”她说，“立马睡觉去。”她说罢带着哆哆嗦嗦的埃芒加德，随后关上门，留下萨拉孤零零地站着。

这梦就这样收场了。炉子里纸张发出的最后一星火花已消失，只留下一堆黑色的灰末，宴会桌已面目全非，金盘子、绚丽的绣花餐巾，还有花环，又变成了旧手绢，红的白的纸片、被丢弃的假花全散落在地板上，乐师座上的乐师已无影无踪，六弦琴和巴松管也悄然无声。爱米丽背靠墙壁坐着，瞪着眼，目光专注。萨拉见了走过去，双手颤抖抱起了它。

“宴会已荡然无存了，爱米丽，”她说，“也见不到什么公主了。什么也没有，留下的只有巴士底监狱里的囚犯。”她说罢坐了下去，双手掩面。

这时，要是她不掩住脸孔，而是正好抬头看看天窗，那会出现什么情况呢？笔者不得而知——也许这一章的结局就截然不同——因为要是她恰好看一眼天窗，那她肯定会被见到的情景吓了一跳。她肯定会看到一张脸贴在玻璃窗上窥视她，这脸就是早些时候她和埃芒加德谈话时窥视她的那张脸。

但是，她却没有抬头看。她坐着，好一会儿，她那长着黑头发的小脑瓜埋在手臂里。每当她竭力要默默地忍受痛苦时往往这样坐着。后来她站起来，慢慢地向床边走去。

“我醒着的时候，再也无法假设别的事了。”她说，“怎么努力也办不到。要是睡着了，没准会做梦，梦中也许我会假设的。”

突然间她感到累得慌——也许是太饿了想吃东西吧——便虚弱地在床沿上坐了下去。

“假设这时候炉火旺旺的，跳动着小小的火焰，”她喃喃道，“假设炉火前有张舒适的椅子——假设椅子旁还有张小桌子，桌子上有份小小的晚餐，热腾腾的——是热腾腾的。假设——”说着，她拉过薄薄的被子盖上，“假设这是张漂漂亮亮、软绵绵的床，有好些羊毛毯，还有大大的鸭绒枕头。假设，假设——”正是疲劳催她闭上眼睛，熟睡了。

她不知道自己睡了多久。反正她因为很累睡得很深，很死——太深太死，什么都打扰不了她，甚至连梅基塞代克全家出洞，奔来窜去，它的儿女们吵吵闹闹，打打斗斗，搅得沸反盈天，这也吵不醒她。

她醒得突然，竟不知道发生了什么特别的事让她醒过来。事实是某种声响唤醒了她——一种真实的声响——是天窗落下关上时发出的嗒嗒声。天窗关上前，有个白色的身影灵巧地溜了出去，又蹲伏在石板瓦上，离天窗很近很近——近得足以看见阁楼里的情况，而自己又不会被人发现。

刚醒过来时，她还闭着眼睛。睡意还是很浓，怪的是，她觉得暖和极了，舒服极了。说实在的，暖和得、舒服得连自己是醒是睡也分不清了。除了在某种美好的梦境中，她从来没有感到这等暖和和舒适。

“好梦！”她喃喃道，“我觉得暖和极了。我——真不想——这就醒哩。”

这当然是梦。她感到身上似乎盖着暖和、漂亮的被子。她甚至竟真真切切地感觉得到毯子。她伸出一只手，触摸到一种十分像缎子面鸭绒被的东西。她可不能从梦境中醒过来——她得一动不动地躺着，让梦继续下去。

但是，她做不到，即使她紧闭着眼睛也做不到。有某种情况逼着她醒过来——是房间里的情况，是光和声音——噼里啪啦声和小小火焰的喧闹声。

“哦，我这就醒过来了，”她哀伤道，“我不由自主——不能不醒。”

她禁不住还是睁开了眼睛。接着，她竟露出了笑容——因为眼前阁楼里的景象是她前所未见的，她知道自己绝不可能见到的。

“哦，原来我还没醒。”她低声道，同时鼓起勇气，用一只胳膊支起身子，看了看四周，“我还在梦中。”她认为这一定是梦，要是醒了，这些东西是不可能有的——不可能有。

你是不是想知道，为什么她觉得自己确实没有回到现实中来？是因为她眼前的景象：是那亮闪闪的熊熊炉火，是吊架上的小铜壶；水已烧开，冒着咝咝作响的热气；是地板上又厚又暖和的猩红地毯；是壁炉前一把打开的折椅，上面铺着软垫；是椅子旁一张小折叠桌子，铺着白台布，摆上几只带盖的小盘、一只茶杯、一只茶碟、一把茶壶；是床上暖和的新毯子和缎面鸭绒被；是脚跟处一件缝制讲究、填充精致的丝睡袍；是床下的一双厚拖鞋，此外还有一些书。她梦中这个房间成了童话世界了——温暖的灯光流溢，那是桌子上一盏有玫瑰色罩子、明亮的灯发出来的。

她坐了起来，身子支在胳膊肘上，呼吸越来越急促，越来越快。

“梦还没有——消失。”她喘着粗气，说，“过去我从未做过这样的梦。”她几乎不敢动一动身子，最后她还是一把掀开被子，两脚落地，欣喜若狂。

“我在梦中——我从床上下来。”她听到自己在说话。接着她置身这一切之间，身子慢慢地从一边转到另一边。“我在梦中，梦仍未消失——真实的梦！我在梦中，觉得是真实的梦！梦被施了魔法——要不就是我被施了魔法。我只是自以为看到了这一切。”她说得越发急促，“只要我继续这样认为，”她大声说道，“别的我不在乎！全不在乎！”

她喘着气站了更久，后来又高声说起来。

“哦，这不是真的！”她说，“不可能是真的！但是，看起来又那么真实！”

她被熊熊炉火吸引过去，她跪了下去，伸出双手，贴近炉火——离得太近，烫得她赶紧往后退。

“我梦中的炉火不可能是烫的！”她高声道。

她跳了起来，摸摸桌子、盘子、地毯，又来到床前，摸了摸毯子。她拿起松软的睡袍，猛地一把抓紧贴在胸前，又贴在面颊上。

“多暖和，多柔软。”她快要哭出来了，“是真的。一定是真的！”

她把睡袍披在肩上，穿上拖鞋。

“它们也是真的。全是真的。”她大声道，“我不是——不是在做梦！”

她几乎是趔趄地来到书堆前，翻开上面的那本。扉页上有字——只有短短几个字，写道：

“送给阁楼里的小女孩。一位朋友赠。”

她看到这些字——她这一举动不是挺怪吗——把脸埋进书里，泪水夺眶而出。

“不知道他是哪个？”她说，“说明有人关心我。我有了一个朋友。”

她拿起蜡烛，悄悄离开自己的房间，到了贝基的房间，站在她床前。

“贝基，贝基！”她壮着胆，低声说道，尽可能提高嗓音，“醒醒！”

贝基醒了过来，直挺挺地坐着，惊讶地呆望着。她脸上仍留着泪痕，脏兮兮的。只见身边站着个身穿艳丽的深红绸缎睡袍的小人儿，面前的那张脸容光焕发，光彩照人。萨拉公主——她记忆中的萨拉正是这样——就站在自己的床前，离得近近的，手里拿着蜡烛。

“来，贝基，”她说，“你来呀，贝基！”

贝基吓得说不出话来。她只是爬起来跟着萨拉，眼睛、嘴巴张得老大老大，一声不吭。

两个人跨过了门槛，萨拉轻轻关上门，把贝基拉到那温暖又明亮的美境中，搅得贝基晕头晕脑，连饥饿感也没有了。

“真的！是真的！”萨拉喊道，“我全触摸过了。这些东西就跟你我一样真实存在。贝基，我睡着时施展过魔法了——今后魔法绝不会让最糟糕的事再度发生了。”





十六　不速之客


请使劲想象一下，那天晚上剩下来的时间是怎么度过的：小壁炉里的炉火在燃烧、闪烁、跳跃，她俩是怎样蹲在炉火旁；她俩又是怎样揭开菜盘上的盖子，发现美味可口浓香的热汤，汤本身就够她俩吃上一顿，何况还有三明治、烤面包片、松糕，多得叫人吃不了。贝基把洗脸台上的水杯当作茶杯，茶香扑鼻，完全没有必要假装成是别的东西。两个小姑娘吃得喝得暖暖和和，心满意足，心花怒放。萨拉发现这奇妙的好运并非梦境，便尽情享用起来，这也是她一贯的做法。她一向生活在想象的世界里，面对发生的所有稀奇古怪的事已习以为常，所以很快便见怪不怪了。

“不知道这事出自世上何人之手，”她说，“反正有这样的人。你看，咱俩就坐在他生的炉火旁，而且——而且——真真切切！不管他是谁——不管人在哪儿——我有了一个朋友。贝基——有个人，他就是我的朋友。”

不可否认，她俩坐在熊熊炉火前，吃着营养丰富、舒心可口的食物，便有一种又喜又敬的感觉，同时又怀着疑惑的神情打量着对方。

“你是不是觉得，”过了一会儿贝基吞吞吐吐地低声问，“是不是觉得这些东西会消失掉呢，小姐？咱俩是不是要抓紧吃呢？”说着她匆匆往嘴里塞三明治。要是这只是一场梦，吃东西时大可不必讲究那些规矩了。

“不，不会消失掉的，”萨拉说，“我嘴里正吃着松糕，有滋有味哩。梦中可吃不到真正的东西，只是以为在吃东西。还有，我不断掐自己，刚刚还摸了摸一块滚烫的煤，我是有意这么做的。”

她俩终于难以抵挡那奇妙、舒适而又懒洋洋的感觉。幸福的儿童吃饱喝足后往往有这种困倦的感觉，她俩坐在炉火前正陶醉在这种感觉之中，最后萨拉的目光转向那变了样的床上。

床上的毯子有好几条，足以分给贝基一条。隔壁房间里那张狭窄的床这天晚上睡上去必然舒服极了，这是床主人梦中也没有享受过的。

贝基走出房间，到了门口转身贪婪地看了看四周。

“即使天亮后全没了，小姐，”她说，“今晚反正让我见识过了，我是永远也忘不了的。”她把每样东西都看了个遍，像是要牢牢装到心里去似的，“你瞧那儿有炉火，”她说着用手指了指，“前面摆着桌子，上面有灯，灯光是粉红色的，像玫瑰。你床上有条缎面被子，地板铺着暖和和的地毯，样样东西都漂漂亮亮的。还有——”她停了一会儿，一只手轻轻按在肚皮上，“——还有汤、三明治、松糕——就在这里面。”至少她已确信，肚子里装的都是真食物，随后走了。

但凡学生中和仆役间，都存在一些神秘的传播通道，所以第二天一大早大家都知道萨拉·克鲁干出件极为丢脸的事，埃芒加德也受到了惩罚。贝基呢，早饭前她得卷铺盖走人，不过她是在厨房里干杂活的，一时还走不了。仆人们都知道，之所以允许贝基待下去是因为明卿小姐一时不容易找到这么一个无亲无故、地位低下的丫头，干的是奴隶的活，拿的是每周寥寥几先令的工钱。学校里年龄大一点的孩子都知道，明卿小姐没撵走萨拉完全出于自身的实际利益。

“她个儿长得高，好歹学到的东西又那么多，”杰西对拉维尼亚说，“很快就让她教课了。明卿小姐心里明白，她得白干活。你够卑鄙的，拉维，告发了人家在阁楼里玩儿的事。你是怎么知道的？”

“我是从洛蒂口中听来的。她还嫩哩，透露给了我，她自己还不知道。告诉明卿小姐有什么卑鄙的？我觉得这是自己的责任——”她还挺自豪哩，“萨拉老哄骗人。可笑的是穿得这么寒酸，还要摆出了不起的架势，眼睛都长在头顶了！”

“给明卿小姐撞见时，她们都在干吗？”

“假装些傻事儿。埃芒加德拿了一篮吃的东西上楼，和萨拉、贝基一起吃。她可从不把东西分给咱们。这我不计较。可她竟把东西分给阁楼里的下人吃，太掉价了。我真不明白明卿小姐怎么不把萨拉撵走——就是真的需要她来教课也不行。”

“要是她给撵走了，你叫她去哪儿？”杰西免不了有点担心地问。

“我怎么知道？”拉维尼亚凶巴巴地答道，“今天上午她进教室时，看上去准要越发怪模怪样了。我想——尤其在出了这种事之后。昨天她没吃上晚饭，今天也别指望吃上一顿。”

杰西有点傻，可心眼并不很坏，一听这话，猛地拿起书。

“不过，我认为这么做太可怕了。”她说，“她们没有权利害得她饿死。”

那天早上，萨拉进厨房时，厨娘斜着眼看她，别的佣人也一样。她急急忙忙从她们身边走过。事实上，她睡得稍稍过头了。贝基也一样，所以两个人没时间相互打照面，各人都是匆匆下楼来的。

萨拉走进洗碗间。贝基在使劲擦水壶，喉咙里还哼着小曲儿。她抬起头，瞧她的脸，很有些喜不自禁的表情。

“我醒过来一看，小姐——毯子还在哩。”她兴奋地低声道，“跟昨晚一个样，全是真的。”

“我的也一样，”萨拉说，“现在东西还在——全在。我边穿衣边吃了些冷的，是咱们吃剩的。”

“哦，老天爷！老天爷！”贝基开心得叽里咕噜起来，但一见厨娘进来，赶紧埋头擦起了水壶。

明卿小姐想看看萨拉进教室时是副什么模样，这跟拉维尼亚倒是不谋而合。在她的眼中，萨拉总是让人恼火，又让人猜不透。任你对她怎么严厉，她就是不哭，也不惊慌。你骂她，她便一声不吭地立着，板着脸恭恭敬敬听着；惩罚她，她就去干分到的活，饭也不吃，不抱怨叫屈，也没露反抗的迹象。她回你的话从不粗暴失礼，但在明卿小姐听来正是粗暴失礼的表示。不过昨天饿了她一天，又经历了昨晚一场暴烈的场面，再加上今天挨饿，她肯定要垮的。要是她下楼时不面色苍白，不两眼通红、神情哀伤，不服服帖帖，那才怪哩。

明卿小姐破天荒第一次进教室听萨拉给小班学生上法语课，听她们朗读，看她辅导做练习。只见萨拉进来时步履轻松，富有弹性，两颊红润，嘴角挂着微笑。明卿小姐从未见过这等奇事，不禁大吃一惊。这孩子是钢打铁铸的不成？倒是怎么回事？她立马把萨拉叫到跟前来。

“你干了丢脸的事，可看上去毫无认识，”她说，“你这是长着榆木脑袋？”

事实是，如果一个人还是个孩子——即使已长大了——只要吃饱、穿暖、睡好、睡够；只要你认为是在童话故事中入睡，醒来后发现这一切又是真实的，那么他不可能不幸福，甚至想装也办不成；任他怎么努力，眼睛不可能不流露出快乐的光辉。当萨拉抬起双眼，完满而彬彬有礼地回答时，她的眼神几乎惊得明卿小姐张口结舌了。

“请你原谅，明卿小姐，”她说，“我知道自己丢了脸。”

“没有忘记就好，可不要装得像是发了大财似的。这是厚颜无耻。别忘了，今天可没有你吃的饭。”

“知道了，明卿小姐，”她说。但是当她转过身走开时，立即想起头天晚上的遭遇，心头怦怦直跳。“要不是魔法及时救我，”她心想，“我的下场就太惨了！”

“她像是不太饿的样子。”拉维尼亚低声道，“瞧她！也许是假装美美吃了早餐——”只听得她恶毒地笑出声来。

“她跟别人就是不一样。”杰西说，看着萨拉跟着自己班里的学生一起学习，“有时候我还怕她三分呢。”

“够荒唐的事儿！”拉维尼亚愤愤地说。

整整一天，萨拉显得喜气洋洋，容光焕发。仆人无不向她投去迷惑不解的目光，窃窃私语，艾米丽亚小姐的蓝色小眼睛也流露出困惑的神情。她实在不明白，人家这样打压萨拉，该是痛不欲生，可她倒好，还是满不在乎，乐呵呵的。不过，这符合萨拉倔强的性子。也许，她已铁了心硬干到底了。

有一件事，萨拉思来想去后，认为非做到不可。那就是必需尽量不让发生的奇迹这一秘密泄露出去。要是明卿小姐再次上阁楼来，秘密免不了全要败露。不过，看起来至少短时期内她来的可能性不大，除非有什么事引起她的怀疑。埃芒加德和洛蒂一定会被严密监视，她俩再也没有胆量偷偷溜出来。倒是可以把这一奇事告诉埃芒加德，相信她会保守秘密的。要是被洛蒂知道了，也可以做到让她不要泄露出去。也许魔法自有法力隐藏住自己的奇迹。

“不管发生什么事，”这天，萨拉整天反复告诉自己，“不管发生什么事，世界上某个地方，有个心地善良的人，他是我的朋友——我的朋友。即使我永远不知道他是谁——即使我永远没有感谢他的机会——我也不会感到自己是个孤苦伶仃的人。哦，魔法对我真仁慈！”

论天气，前天算是坏的了，但是今天更加恶劣——更冷、更潮、更泥泞。要干的活儿更多，厨娘的脾气更坏，她知道萨拉受了罚，越发蛮不讲理了。但是一旦有了魔法师这个朋友，任它发生什么事都算不了什么了。头天晚上萨拉美美地吃了一顿后，只觉得浑身都有力气。她知道，一整天即使免不了要挨饿，晚上定能暖和和地睡个好觉。她认为自己能挨到第二天开早饭，到时候总该让她吃东西吧。天很晚了，她终于回到了阁楼。她被允许在教室里学到十点钟。她对学习有了兴趣，书看得很晚才上楼来。

她上了楼，在阁楼门前站了下来。说实在的，这时候她的心跳得快极了。

“不用说东西没准全被收回去了，”她尽量装得挺勇敢的样子，低声说，“那都是昨晚念我陷入了可怕的境地才暂时借给我的，是借给我的——我也享用过了，都是真的。”

她打开门，走了进去。她再次微微喘着气，关上门，背靠门，满房间打量起来。

魔法又施展了一番。真真切切，法力比上次还要广大。炉火在熊熊烧着，火光欢快地跳着，越发赏心悦目。阁楼里搬进了好多新东西，面貌大为改观，要不是她深信不疑的话，准会惊得去擦自己的眼睛了。低矮的桌子上又摆上了晚餐——这一回不但有归她用的杯盘碗碟，还为贝基准备了一副。破壁炉台上铺了一块鲜亮厚实的毯子，上面还绣着从未见过的花花草草。毯子上放着一些小摆设。原先光秃秃、难看的东西能遮盖的都蒙上了布幔，显得十分美观。墙上用图钉钉着一些色彩绚丽的奇特布料。那些图钉又结实又尖，不用锤子就能用手摁进木头和灰泥里去。墙上还钉上几把色彩缤纷的扇子，地上摆着几只大垫子，又大又结实，完全可以坐人。还有一只木头箱子，上面铺了块毯子，摆着几个坐垫，看起来很有沙发的派头。

萨拉慢慢地一步一步地离开房门，干脆一屁股坐了下去，又前后左右打量起来。“实在像童话成真了。”她说。

“千真万确，丝毫也没区别。我觉得自己这下神通广大了，想什么就有什么——钻石呀，成袋成袋的金子呀，全都会有！天底下还有什么比这更古怪的？这就是我的阁楼？我还是那个破衣烂衫、又冷又湿的萨拉吗？想当初我假装又假装，但愿出现仙女哩！我一向眼巴巴地只有一个愿望，那就是能让童话故事变成现实。这不，现在我就生活在童话故事之中。我觉得自己已经是仙女了，掌握了点石成金的法力。”

她站起来敲了敲墙，叫隔壁牢房的难友过来，不一会儿贝基来了。

难友一进来，差点没跌倒在地，瘫成一团，好一会儿都喘不过气来。

“哦，老天爷！”她上气不接下气地说，“哦，老天爷，小姐！”——那情景跟早上在洗碗间里的表现一模一样。

“你倒是瞧瞧。”萨拉说。

这天晚上贝基就坐在炉前地毯的软垫上，用上了她自己的杯碟。

萨拉来到床前，发现床上铺的是厚厚的新床垫，摆着几只鸭绒大枕头。原先的床垫和枕头都移放到贝基的床上了，结果呢，贝基添了这些东西后，睡起来自有从未有过的舒服。

“全是哪来的？”贝基有一回禁不住问道，“老天爷！哪个干的，小姐！”

“就别问了，”萨拉答道，“要不是我想说‘哦，谢谢你了’，我还是不知道的好。这反而觉得更美好。”

从此生活变得一天比一天更神奇。童话故事从不间断。几乎每天都有新变化。每天晚上萨拉回来打开房门就会看到出现一些新的用具或装饰物，用不了多久，小小的阁楼就成了摆满各种各样稀奇华贵东西的地方了。难看丑陋的墙壁渐渐全挂上图画和挂毯，出现了一件件精致的折叠家具，墙上挂上了满是书的书架，前后添了一件又一件新的家具和用具，最后已是一应俱全，什么也不缺了。早晨，萨拉下了楼，桌子上摆着的是吃剩的饭菜，晚上回到阁楼里，剩饭冷菜已被魔法收拾走了，换上一份小小而可口的晚餐。明卿小姐照样凶相毕露，出口伤人，艾米丽亚小姐还是一个劲儿地怨天尤人，那些女佣改不了粗俗无礼的性子。不管刮风下雨，天寒地冻，萨拉还是被差出去跑腿，挨骂受气，吆来喝去。几乎不允许她与埃芒加德和洛蒂搭话，拉维尼亚对她身上的衣衫越来越横加嘲讽。她来到教室，其他的女孩都怪怪地瞪着她看。但是她既然生活在神奇的故事里，这一切算得了什么？过去她挨饿时想象出种种故事来安慰自己幼小的心灵，使自己免于陷入绝望，相比之下，如今的生活不是更浪漫、更快活吗？有时候，遇到被训斥时，她忍不住快要笑出声来。

“你们哪知道？”她暗自想道，“你们哪里知道？”

她享受到的舒适而快乐的生活使她变得越来越强壮，今后有望也会保持下去。如果她外出办事回来浑身湿透，又累又饿，她知道只要爬到阁楼，很快就能暖和起来，吃得饱饱的。最艰难的日子里，只要想一想，回家打开房门时会看到什么，又有什么样的欢乐等着自己，她就转忧为喜。很快她变得不那么消瘦了。两颊红润起来，双眼也与脸面相称，不显得过于大了。

“萨拉·克鲁的脸色出奇得好。”明卿小姐不怀好意地对妹妹说。

“可不是，”可怜而傻乎乎的艾米丽亚小姐说，“她一准越来越胖了。过去她可是个饿瘪了肚皮的小乌鸦。”

“饿瘪了肚皮？”明卿小姐怒冲冲地嚷道，“她没有理由显得像是挨饿。她一向就吃得饱饱的！”

“还——还用说？”艾米丽亚顺从地附和道，她胆战心惊地发现自己又像通常那样，说错了话。

“看到这种岁数的小孩脸上出现那样的表情总觉得不对劲。”明卿小姐说得傲气十足，可又含含糊糊。

“啥——啥表情？”艾米丽亚壮着胆问。

“完全可以说是挑衅，”明卿小姐恼火极了，因为她知道令她反感的跟挑衅压根不相干，可又想不出更难听的话来，“换了别的孩子遇到这样非得逆来顺受不可的变故，精神和意志就会消沉下去，就会被彻底压垮。可说实话，她丝毫也不受影响，还像个——像个公主似的。”

“你还记得吧，”脑子缺根筋的艾米丽亚小姐插言道，“那天她在教室里对你说什么来着：你会怎么办，要是你发现她是——”

“记不得了，”明卿小姐说，“别尽说废话。”其实她记得一清二楚。

自然啰，甚至连贝基也变得越来越胖，不再老担惊受怕了。她这也不是有意硬要这样。在秘密的童话故事里她也是个受惠者。她有两条褥子，两只枕头，不少的被子，每天晚上吃到热腾腾的晚饭，炉火前坐垫上也有自己的一席之地。巴士底监狱已消融，囚犯已不复存在。只有两个称心如意的小女孩陶醉在欢乐之中。有时候萨拉拿来自己的书朗诵一段，有时候做做功课，有时候坐在壁炉前，眼望着炉火，竭力想象自己的这个朋友可能是哪个，渴望能和他说说心里话。

接着又出了件事。来了个人，在大门口留下几包东西。上面用粗大字体写着：“右边阁楼的小姑娘收。”

萨拉被打发去开了门，把东西拿了进来。她把最大的两包东西放在大厅的桌子上，看了看地址，恰好明卿小姐下楼来，撞见了她。

“这些东西是哪位小姐的就给她送去，”她厉声道，“别傻站着干瞪眼。”

“东西是送给我的。”萨拉轻声道。

“送给你的？”明卿小姐惊问道，“你这是什么意思？”

“我不知道是从哪儿送来的，”萨拉说，“可上面写着是送给我的。我就睡在右面的阁楼里。贝基在左面。”

明卿小姐来到她的身旁，看了看包包，显得十分兴奋。

“里面都有些什么？”她问。

“不知道。”萨拉答。

“打开。”明卿小姐勒令道。

萨拉照吩咐做了。包包一个个被打开，明卿小姐的脸上露出奇特的表情。呈现在她眼前的全是漂亮、舒适的衣物——各种各样全有：鞋子、袜子、手套，还有一件暖暖和和、漂漂亮亮的外衣，甚至还有一顶好看的帽子、一把雨伞，全是昂贵、上好的东西。外衣口袋里别着一张字条，上面写着：“供日常穿戴——需要替换时会送来新的。”

明卿小姐异常激动。这事儿太意外了，她那利欲熏心的头脑里不觉生出一些奇怪的联想。她到底是不是看错人了？这个被遗弃的孩子暗地里还有个朋友，性情虽然古怪，可有权有势——也许是个此前不为人知的亲戚，突然打探出萨拉的下落，便选用这种神秘而古怪的办法来资助她？亲戚的事往往都很古怪——特别是那些有钱的单身老舅、老叔辈，他们不喜欢身边有孩子。这种人宁愿离得远远的，来关心晚辈的福利。这种人肯定都性格古怪、脾气暴躁，得罪不起。要是真的出来这样的人，让他知道真相，知道自己的至亲落得衣衫单薄、褴褛、吃不饱，还要干重活的境地，那可要出乱子了。她觉得事情实在太古怪，心里七上八下，拿不准主意，不禁瞟了萨拉一眼。

“可不是吗，”她说话的口气是自这孩子丧父之后从未有过的，“有人仁慈地对你。既然给你送来东西，以后穿破了还有新的，那就穿上吧，好显得体面些。换好衣服你就下楼到教室学习去。今天你就不必去办事了。”

约摸半小时后，教室的门开了，萨拉走了进去，教室里全体学生都惊得目瞪口呆。

“老天爷！”杰西不由喊出声来，直捅拉维尼亚的胳膊肘，“你瞧萨拉公主！”

大家都在打量她，拉维尼亚一见，脸孔涨得通红。

可不是，正是萨拉公主。至少现在的她比当年被看作是公主的时候更像公主了，和几小时前从后楼梯下来的那个萨拉判若两人。你看萨拉身上的那件连衣裙，正是拉维尼亚向来看着眼红的那种，浓浓的暖色，做工讲究。一双小腿还是过去杰西羡慕不已的那样纤细小巧。一头浓发用缎带挽在脑后，要是任其披散在独特的小脸四周，看起来就像设德兰群岛产的矮种马。

“没准哪个给她留下了一笔财产，”杰西悄声道，“我老想，她一准会遇上怪的事儿。她这人太怪了。”

“也许又突然冒出什么钻石矿来了？”拉维尼亚挖苦地说，“别这样盯着她看，美了她了，你这傻丫头。”

“萨拉，”明卿小姐那低沉的声音响起来，“进来吧，坐在这儿。”

全教室的孩子都睁大眼睛，相互捅胳膊肘，一时难以抑制自己的强烈好奇心。萨拉坐回到自己过去的荣誉席，头伏在书本上。

当天晚上，萨拉回到阁楼，和贝基一起吃过晚饭后，她在壁炉前坐下，严肃地打量着炉火。

“你脑瓜子里又在编什么故事了，小姐？”贝基崇敬地轻声问。每当萨拉一声不吭地坐着，以梦幻般的眼神望着炉火，这意味着她在编新的故事。但是这次她没有在编，她摇了摇头。

“没有，”她说，“我在想，应该怎么办。”

贝基凝视着她——仍然怀着崇敬的神情。她对萨拉的一言一行无不怀着近似崇拜之情。

“我禁不住想到我的那位朋友，”萨拉解释道，“要是他不愿意公开露面，想方设法找出他是哪个就有失礼貌了。我多么想让他知道，是他使我变得这么快活。心地善良的人使别人快活，也想知道对方是如何快活起来的。他们所关心的不是人家的感谢。我想——我真想——”

说到这里，没有说下去，因为这时她看到房角的桌子上有样东西。两天前她就在房子里发现这件东西了。这是只小小的文具盒，里面装着信纸、信封、钢笔和墨水。

“哦，”她喊道，“之前我怎么没想到呢？”

她说罢站起身，来到房角，拿起文具盒，回到壁炉前。

“我可以给他写信，”她高兴地说，“把写好的信留在桌子上。也许来收拾餐具的人会把信也拿走的。信里我不会问什么事的。我对他的一片感谢之意他肯定是不会介意的。”

于是她写了一封短信。信是这样写的：

您不愿意公开自己的身份，而我却要给您写信，希望您不要认为这是不礼貌的行为。请相信，我不想——我真的无意做个不礼貌的人，或试图打探什么事。我只想感谢您对我的关爱——天使般的关爱——使一切变得像童话故事般奇妙。我对您感激不尽，我自己也快乐无比——贝基也一样。贝基对您同样怀着深深的感激之情——和我一样，她也觉得这一切是多么的美好，多么的奇妙。在此之前我俩非常、非常孤单，受冻挨饿，而现在——哦，一想到您为我俩所做的一切，还能说什么呢？请允许我只说这几个字，我非说不可的几个字：谢谢您——谢谢您——谢谢您！

阁楼里的小女孩

第二天早晨，她把短信留在小桌子上。晚上，信与其他东西被拿走了。可见那魔法师已收到信了。萨拉想到此就觉得更高兴了。各自上床前，萨拉给贝基读了一本新收到的书，读着读着，她的注意力被天窗外的一个声音吸引过去。她的眼睛离开书本，抬头一看，贝基也听到那声响了，只见她转过身在看，紧张地听着。

“那边有啥东西，小姐。”她低声道。

“知道了。”萨拉慢慢答道，“听起来——很像猫——想钻进来。”

她离开椅子，来到天窗前。她听到的是挺怪挺轻的声音——像是抓挠声。她猛地想起了什么，不觉笑了起来。想起来了，一个怪东西，有一次闯到阁楼里来。就在那天下午，她看见那东西闷闷不乐地蹲在那印度绅士家窗前的桌子上。

“说不定，”她又高兴又激动地小声说，“说不定就是那只猴子又逃出来了。哦，但愿就是那只猴子！”

她爬上椅子，小心翼翼地拉起天窗，朝外张望。这天整天都下着雪，就在她附近的雪上，蹲着一只瘦小的身影，打着冷战，见到她，那只小黑脸就可怜巴巴地紧缩起来。

“是那猴子，”她失声喊了起来，“从那印度绅士家里跑出来，见到咱们的灯光就过来了。”

贝基急忙奔到她身旁。

“你让它进来，小姐？”她问。

“是的，”萨拉欢快地答道，“天太冷了，不能让猴子待在外面。猴子很娇嫩。让我哄他进来。”

萨拉小小心心伸出一只手，发出哄劝的声音，她往往用这种声音对麻雀和梅基塞代克说话——自己就好像是只友善的小动物，出于爱心，非常理解动物胆怯的天性。

“过来，亲爱的猴子，”她说，“我不会伤害你的。”

猴子知道她不会伤害自己。她把自己软软的小手放在它身上，边抚摸边朝自己拉过来。它就知道她不会伤害自己。它在拉姆·达斯那双细长、棕色的手中就感到人类的爱心，它在萨拉手中也有同样的感受。它让她把自己提起来，抱进天窗。后来它偎依在她胸口，友善地抓住她的一绺头发，抬头打量她。

“乖猴子！乖猴子！”她哼着，亲吻着那好玩的脑袋，“哦，我就喜爱小动物。”

显而易见，这猴子乐于挨近炉火。她坐了下来，把它抱在膝上。这时它看了看萨拉，又看了看贝基，那神情显得既好奇又感激。

“它的模样可不怎么样，小姐，你说是不是？”贝基说。

“看起来像个难看的小娃娃，”萨拉笑着说，“请不要生气，小猴子；你不是娃娃我才高兴哩。你娘，绝不会为你感到骄傲的，也不会有哪个敢说你长得像自己的哪个亲戚。哦，可我就是喜欢你！”

她说罢背靠椅子，陷入了沉思。

“也许他为自己长得丑而伤心吧，”她说，“他老是这么想。不知道他会不会动脑子？小猴子，宝贝，你会不会动脑子？”

可猴子只是举起爪子搔自己的脑袋。

“你打算拿它怎么办？”贝基问。

“今晚我让他跟我一起睡。明天把他送还给印度绅士。我舍不得送走你，小猴子。可你得走。你应该最爱自己的家。可我连一个真正的亲戚也没有。”

她睡前在自己的脚边给猴子做了一个窝。小猴子蜷起了身子，像个小娃娃，睡着了，对自己有这么个安身的地方感到高兴。





十七　“正是这孩子！”


第二天下午，“大家庭”的三个孩子坐在印度绅士书房里，变着法子逗印度绅士开心。他们是受到他的特别邀请，得到许可来执行这项使命的。最近一段时间，他一直在焦虑不安的状态下度过，今天更是急不可耐地等待着一件事。那就是卡迈克尔先生今天要从莫斯科回来了。卡迈克尔先生在那边待了一周又一周，迟迟回不来。他初到那里，找不到他要找的那一家人的踪迹，令他挺失望。最后他终于满有把握地找到了他们，去了他们的家，人家告诉他说，他们不在家，出门旅行去了。此行所作的种种努力眼看着要付诸东流，所以只好决定留在莫斯科，等着他们回来。卡里斯福特先生坐在他的躺椅上，珍妮特坐在他身旁的地板上。他非常喜欢珍妮特。诺拉找到了一条矮凳，唐纳德则骑在一个用来装饰虎皮地毯的虎头上。必须承认，他一摇一晃地骑着，真够野的。

“骑起马来别弄出这么大的声响来，唐纳德，”珍妮特说，“你这是来逗病人开心的，可不能扯着嗓子乱嚷嚷。是不是太闹了，卡里斯福特先生？”——这话是对印度绅士说的。

他拍拍她的肩。

“不闹，”他说，“这倒好，让我免得想得太多。”

“我这就一声不响了，”唐纳德嚷道，“咱们全像耗子，一声不吱。”

“耗子决不会像你那样乱嚷嚷的。”珍妮特说。

唐纳德用手绢当作缰绳，骑在虎头上一高一低地蹦着。

“来一大群耗子就有可能，”他高高兴兴地说，“上千只就有可能。”

“我相信就算来五万只也不行，”珍妮特板着脸说，“咱们都得像一只耗子，安安静静的。”

卡里斯福特先生笑开了，再次拍了拍她的肩。

“用不了多久爸爸就回来了，”她说，“咱们可不可以这就说说那失踪的小女孩？”

“这时候我恐怕不太有心情说别的事。”印度绅士皱起眉头，一脸倦意，说。

“我们都非常喜欢她，”诺拉说，“我们管她叫非童话里的公主。”

“为什么？”印度绅士问，因为“大家庭”的奇思妙想总让他一时不去想一些事。

回答他的是珍妮特。

“这是因为，虽然她现在还不是仙女，可找到她后，她就像童话中的公主，很富有。起初我们管她叫童话中的公主，可觉得不合适。”

“真的吗？”诺拉说，“她爸爸把钱全交给自己的朋友投到有钻石的矿里，后来他朋友以为钱全损失了，便逃跑了，因为他觉得自己简直成了强盗了，真的吗？”

“知道吗，事实上他不是这种人。”珍妮特急忙插言道。

印度绅士马上握住她的手。

“是的，他确实不是这种人。”他说。

“我为这个朋友感到难过，”珍妮特说，“我没法不难过。他没存心这样做，而且使他很伤心。我肯定会使他伤透心的。”

“你这孩子，小小年纪还挺善解人意呢，珍妮特。”印度绅士说着，把她的手握得更紧了。

“你有没有跟卡里斯福特先生说过，”唐纳德再次大声问，“说过那‘不是叫花子的小女孩’的事？有没有说过她已有了漂亮的新衣服？说不定她也丢失过，现在被人找到了。”

“马车来了！”珍妮特喊了起来，“在门前停下来了。是爸爸！”

大家都跑到窗口去看。

“是的，是爸爸，”唐纳德说，“可没见小女孩。”

三个孩子不由自主地跑出房间，争先恐后地涌进了大厅。他们总是以这样的方式来迎接自己父亲的。接着准能听到他们蹦蹦跳跳，拍着手，被抱起来亲吻。

卡里斯福特先生挣扎着想站起来，可还是跌进了椅子里。

“真没用，”他说，“我不成废人了吗？”

卡迈克尔先生的声音已近在门口了。

“不行，孩子们，”只听他说道，“我跟卡里斯福特先生谈过后你们再进来。去跟拉姆·达斯玩会儿。”

门开了，他走了进来。他的脸显得比原先更红润了，带来一股清新和健康的气息。但与病人急切询问的目光相遇时，甚至在他俩紧握手时，他的眼里透出失望和焦急的神色。

“有什么消息？”卡里斯福特先生问，“关于那个被俄国人收养的孩子？”

“她不是我们要找的孩子。”这便是卡迈克尔先生的回答，“她比克鲁上尉的女儿小很多。她叫爱米丽·卡柳。我见过她，跟她谈过话。那俄国夫妇提供出非常详细的材料。”

印度绅士这时候显得那么疲惫和痛苦！他的手从卡迈克尔先生手中滑了下来。

“如此说来还得重新开始寻访，”他说，“就这样吧，请坐。”

卡迈克尔先生坐了下来。不知不觉间他已渐渐喜欢上这不幸的人了。他本人身体健康，生活幸福，生活在欢乐和关爱之中，所以在他看来孤独与病痛越发显得悲惨而难以承受了。房子里只要响起一个孩子尖细、欢乐的嗓音，就不会如此凄凉酸楚；一个人若是心事重重，始终觉得自己做错了事，害得一个孩子无家可归，这确实是一件无法面对的惨事。

“好了，好了，”他用一种愉快的声音说道，“找到她还是有希望的。”

“必须马上动手找，刻不容缓。”卡里斯福特先生焦急地说，“你有什么新的建议吗?——什么样的建议都行。”

卡迈克尔先生显得有些心神不宁，站起来在房间里踱来踱去，脸上显出一副若有所思、犹豫不决的神情。

“这个，也许，”他说，“我拿不准这值不值得。是这么回事，我在从多佛回来的火车上思前想后，突然产生这么一个想法。”

“什么想法？只要她还在人世，她必定在某个地方。”

“不错，她是在某个地方。我们已经找过巴黎的所有学校。巴黎就不去找了，那就开始在伦敦找。我的想法就是——在伦敦找。”

“伦敦有不少这类学校。”卡里斯福特先生说。这时他心头一动，想起了一件事，“可不是，隔壁就有一所。”

“那就从那儿开始。这么做最方便不过了。”

“说的是，”卡里斯福特先生说，“那儿有个孩子引起了我的注意。不过她不是学生，是个肤色黝黑、孤苦无依的孩子。这个可怜的小姑娘跟克鲁一点也不像。”

也许此时此刻魔法又显灵了——可真是魔力无边。看来确实如此。倒是什么让拉姆·达斯在这个时候想到要进房间来——甚至是在东家正和别人说话的时候？只见他进了房间，毕恭毕敬行了个额手礼，乌黑发亮的眼睛闪着无法掩饰的兴奋光芒。

“老爷，”他说，“那孩子本人来了——就是老爷可怜的那个孩子。她是送猴子来的。猴子又跑到她的阁楼里去了。我让她别走。我寻思让她见见老爷，跟你老说说话儿，兴许让你高兴高兴。”

“她是谁？”卡迈克尔先生问。

“天知道，”卡里斯福特先生说，“她就是刚才我说的那个孩子。那个学校里的小苦力。”他向拉姆·达斯摆摆手，对他说，“不错，我是想见见她。让她进来吧。”他转而对卡迈克尔先生说，“你远行时，”他大声道，“我陷入了绝望的境地，只觉得度日如年，眼前一片黑暗。拉姆·达斯对我说起这不幸的孩子，于是我们两人就想出一个颇具浪漫色彩的计划准备帮一帮她。我觉得这虽是件略带孩子气的事情，却让我有所作为，也可分心旁事。不过若没有拉姆·达斯这么一个身手轻捷、机敏灵活的东方人帮助，这事万万办不成。”

说话间，萨拉进了房间。她双手抱着猴子。显然，猴子对她恋恋不舍，紧紧缠着她，叽里咕噜个不停。萨拉有机会置身印度绅士的房间，很是新奇，兴奋得两颊绯红。

“您的猴子又跑出来了，”她说，嗓音甜甜的，“昨晚他到了我阁楼的天窗前，天太冷了，我把他抱了进去。要不是天太晚了，当晚我准送他回来的。我知道您身体有恙，也许不愿有人打扰。”

印度绅士那深陷的眼睛露出好奇的目光，饶有兴趣地打量着她。

“你想得很周到。”他说。

萨拉看了站在门口的拉姆·达斯一眼。

“我这就把猴子交给拉斯卡，好吗？”她问。

“你怎么知道他是拉斯卡？”印度绅士微微一笑，反问道。

“哦，我认得出拉斯卡，”她说着把那只老大不情愿的猴子递过去，“我生在印度。”

冷不防地，印度绅士直直地坐了起来，表情起了很大的变化，把萨拉吓了一跳。

“你生在印度，”他大声道，“是吗？过来。”他说着伸出自己的手。

萨拉到了他跟前，把手放到他的手中，他像是很愿意握她的手。她静静地站着，她那灰绿色的眼睛惊讶地与他的眼睛相遇。他似乎有什么触动。

“你住在隔壁？”他问。

“是的。我待在明卿小姐的寄宿学校里。”

“你不是她的学生？”

萨拉的嘴角露出一丝怪怪的笑意。她犹豫了片刻。

“我不知道自己到底是什么身份。”她答道。

“为什么？”

“最初，我是学生，是个特殊的学生。可现在——”

“过去你是学生！那么现在呢？”

萨拉的嘴角又浮现出怪怪的、忧伤的微笑。

“我睡在阁楼里，与在厨房打杂的小工为邻。”她说，“我为厨娘跑腿——她吩咐的事我全要干。我还要给年龄小的孩子上课。”

“你来问她，卡迈克尔。”卡里斯福特先生又跌坐回椅子，仿佛已精疲力竭了，“你来问。我问不下去了。”

“大家庭”里高大、慈祥的父亲懂得如何来问小姑娘。萨拉听到他那悦耳而鼓励人的声音，便知道他在这方面很有经验。

“你刚才说的‘最初’是什么意思，我的孩子？”他问。

“指的是我爸爸最初带我来学校的时候。”

“你爸爸现在在哪儿？”

“他去世了，”萨拉非常镇静地说，“他的钱全没了，没给我留下一分一毫。再也没人照料我，没人给明卿小姐付我的费用了。”

“卡迈克尔！”印度绅士高声喊了起来，“卡迈克尔！”

“我们不能吓着她。”卡迈克尔先生急忙侧身对印度绅士低声说，然后又大声对萨拉说起来，“因此他们就打发你住在阁楼里，让你去干杂活了。是这样吗？”

“没人照料我，”萨拉说，“我也没钱，是个没人要的孩子。”

“你父亲的钱是怎么失去的？”印度绅士喘着粗气，插言问道。

“不是他自己丢掉的，”萨拉说，她越来越感到好奇了，“他有个非常要好的朋友——他非常喜欢这个朋友。就是这个朋友拿走了他的钱。他太相信这个朋友了。”

印度绅士的呼吸更急促了。

“他的朋友可能不是存心想伤害他，”他说，“也许是出于误会造成的。”

萨拉并不知道，自己那稚气的声音、平静的回答深深地刺痛了对方的心。若是她知道了，肯定会为印度绅士着想，说得柔和一些。

“结果还是带来了苦难，”她说，“害死了我爸爸。”

“你爸爸叫什么名字？”印度绅士问，“告诉我吧。”

“他叫拉尔夫·克鲁，”萨拉答道，她感到很惊讶，“克鲁上尉。他死在印度。”

那张憔悴的面孔抽搐起来，拉姆·达斯赶紧跑到东家身旁。

“卡迈克尔！”病人气喘吁吁道，“正是这孩子——这孩子！”

一时间萨拉以为他快要死了。拉姆·达斯从一只瓶子里倒出几滴药水，送到东家嘴边。萨拉立在附近，身子有些哆嗦。她迷惑地看着卡迈克尔先生。

“我是哪个？”她结结巴巴地问。

“他就是你父亲的那个朋友，”卡迈克尔答道，“别害怕。我们已找了你两年了。”

萨拉把一只手放到额头上，她的嘴巴抖动起来。她像是在梦中，说了起来。

“我一直在明卿小姐寄宿学校里。”她像是在轻声耳语，“就在墙的那一边。”





十八　“我也不想！”


多亏可亲可爱的卡迈克尔太太才把事儿解释清楚。他们即刻派人去请她来。她过了广场，进来，把萨拉搂入自己温暖的怀中，把发生的事一五一十给萨拉说明白。虚弱不堪的卡里斯福特先生经不起这场天大的意外发现激起的兴奋，几乎垮了。

“说实在的，”在此之前，听到有人建议应当把小姑娘领到另一个房间去，他虚弱地对卡迈克尔先生说，“我真的不愿她离开我的左右。”

“我会照料好她的，”珍妮特说，“用不了几分钟妈妈就来了。”结果还是珍妮特把她领了出去。

“真高兴终于找到你了，”珍妮特说，“你不知道找到你我们有多高兴。”

唐纳德两手插在口袋里，一双眼睛盯着萨拉，显出沉思和自责的神情。

“要是我把六便士给了你时，问你的姓名，”他说，“你就会告诉我，你叫萨拉·克鲁，要是那样，一下子就找到你了。”

不久卡迈克尔太太来了。看神情，她非常激动，一下子就把萨拉搂进怀里，亲吻起来。

“看来你还不明白到底是怎么回事哩，可怜的孩子，”她说，“这没有什么可奇怪的。”

萨拉脑子里只想着一件事。

“他是不是，”她说，眼望着关着的书房门，“就是那个坏朋友？哦，请你告诉我吧！”

卡迈克尔太太再次亲着萨拉，自己也哭了。她觉得萨拉应该经常得到亲吻，因为很久没人亲过她了。

“他人不坏，宝贝，”她说，“其实他并没有把你父亲的钱损失光。只是他以为损失光了。正因为他爱你的父亲，他痛心疾首，伤心得一病不起，有一段时间神志不清。脑炎几乎要了他的命。没等他的病情开始好转，你的父亲就过世了。”

“他也不知道上哪儿找到我，”萨拉喃喃道，“可我离他那么近。”她好歹忘不了自己离他那么近。

“他认为你在法国上学，”卡迈克尔太太解释道，“于是始终被错误的线索耽误了。他到处找你。他见到你从眼前走过，看起来非常伤心，孤苦无助，连做梦也没想到，你就是自己可怜朋友的孩子。不过他看你也是个小姑娘，所以产生了恻隐之心，想让你快乐些。于是他让拉姆·达斯爬进你的阁楼，尽量使你过得舒服些。”

她听了高兴得跳起来，整个神情全变了。

“那些东西全是拉姆·达斯搬进来的？”她大声道，“是他吩咐拉姆·达斯做的？是他使好梦成真的？”

“是的，宝贝——是这样！他心地好、善良，他同情你是因为看在不知去向的萨拉·克鲁的份上。”

书房的门打开了，出来的是卡迈克尔先生，他招手唤她进去。

“卡里斯福特先生已经好些了，”他说，“他让你去见他。”

萨拉没有犹豫。她一走进去，印度绅士看着她，见她的脸上焕发着光彩。

她走近了，站在他坐的椅子前，双手紧紧贴在胸前。

“是你送东西给我，”她轻声说，口气又高兴，又激动，“那些漂漂亮亮的东西？原来是你送的！”

“是的，我亲爱的可怜孩子，是我送的。”他答道。长年疾病和痛苦折磨得他很虚弱，身体垮了，但是他看着她的眼神让她想起了自己父亲的目光——充满了爱意，洋溢着想把她搂在怀里的愿望。面对此情此景，她不觉地在他身旁跪了下来。想当年父女情深，两个人是世界上一对最好的朋友，那时她也是这么做的。

“如此说来我的朋友就是你，”她说，“我的朋友就是你！”她说罢将小脸蛋贴到他消瘦的手上，反复亲吻起来。

“这人不出三个星期准会康复如初，”卡迈克尔先生侧身对妻子说，“瞧他这时的脸色就知道我说得不错。”

他确实变了个人似的。如今有“小主妇”在身边，就有他考虑和筹划的事。首先是那个明卿小姐。务必去见她，通知她，她的这位学生的命运已发生变化。

萨拉决不能再回寄宿学校了。对这点印度绅士的态度很坚决。萨拉就留在现在待的地方，明卿小姐那边卡迈克尔先生亲自去跟她谈。

“用不着回去了，我很高兴。”萨拉说，“她一定会挺生气的。她不喜欢我；不过也许是我的不是，因为我不喜欢她。”

可奇怪的是，卡迈克尔先生用不着跑这一趟了，因为明卿小姐亲自找自己的学生来了。原来她有事要找萨拉，一问之下才听到一件令她大吃一惊的事。有个女佣看见萨拉外衣里藏着样东西，偷偷溜出地下室，而且还看到她上了隔壁人家的台阶，进了屋。

“她这是怎么回事？”明卿小姐冲着艾米丽亚直嚷嚷。

“我不知道，说不准，姐姐，”艾米丽亚小姐答道，“要不就是她跟那人交上朋友了，因为那人在印度待过。”

“她就是这种货色，硬要跟人家拉关系，用不光彩的手段博得人家的同情。”明卿小姐说，“她在人家屋里准保有两个小时了。我不允许她这等放肆。我要去问个明白，还要为她的无礼行为赔不是。”

萨拉坐在卡里斯福特先生身边的矮凳上，紧挨着他的膝盖。他觉得有许多事有必要向她解释清楚。她听着听着，这时候拉姆·达斯通报说明卿小姐求见。

萨拉不由自主地站了起来，顿时脸孔变得煞白，但卡里斯福特先生看见她镇定地站着，丝毫没有流露出小孩子常见的那种惊慌失措。

明卿小姐庄重地走了进来。她的一身装束讲究，且很得体，举止有些生硬，却不失礼貌。

“我很抱歉打扰卡里斯福特先生了，”她说，“我是来为有些事作出解释的。我是明卿小姐，是隔壁明卿小姐寄宿学校的负责人。”

印度绅士默默地审视了她片刻。他天生的火暴脾气，但不想事事由着性子来。

“如此说来你就是明卿小姐了？”他说。

“正是，先生。”

“这样的话，”印度绅士说，“你来得正好。我的律师卡迈克尔先生正准备去见你。”

卡迈克尔先生微微鞠了一躬，明卿小姐惊讶地看了看他，又看了看卡里斯福特先生。

“你的律师！”她说，“我不明白。我是履行自己的职责而来。我已经发现鄙校一位学生闯入您的家——作出这等鲁莽举动的是位受救济的学生。我是来向您说明，她的这种行为是在我毫不知情的情况下作出的。”她说着转身对萨拉说，“马上回家，”她愤愤地命令道，“你将受到严惩。马上给我回家。”

印度绅士把萨拉拉到自己的身边，轻轻拍了拍她的手。

“她不回去了。”

明卿小姐听傻了。

“不回去了？”她重复了一句。

“是的，”卡里斯福特先生说，“不回家了——如果你把那叫做家的话。她今后的家就在这里，跟我一起。”

“跟你一起！跟你一起，先生！我不明白你的意思。”

“费心给她解释解释，卡迈克尔先生，”印度绅士说，“尽快把事情处理妥。”他又让萨拉坐下，把她的双手握在自己的手中——这又是她爸爸一个习惯性的小动作。

接着，卡迈克尔先生解释起来——声音不高不低，不徐不急，坚决而肯定，充分体现出对自己业务及其法律意义的熟悉。明卿小姐这个生意人对此不会不明白，也知道这不是件值得高兴的事。

“夫人，”他说，“卡里斯福特先生是已故克鲁上尉的亲密朋友。他是他某巨大投资事业的合资人。克鲁上尉误认为失去的资产业已全部失而复得，现由卡里斯福特先生代为保管。”

“资产！”明卿小姐失声道。她喊叫时脸上已全无血色。“萨拉的资产！”

“将都是萨拉的资产，”卡迈克尔先生道，语调相当平静，“事实上，现在已归萨拉所有了。某些情况已使这笔资产大为增加。那些钻石矿又欣欣向荣了。”

“钻石矿！”明卿小姐直喘粗气。她感到，如果此话当真，她这是遭受到平生从未有过的可怕打击。

“这些钻石矿。”卡迈克尔先生又重复了一句。他忍不住又补充了这一句，而且露出并非律师所有的狡诈笑容：

“世上鲜有像你这位受人救济的穷学生萨拉·克鲁那样富有的公主。卡里斯福特先生寻找她都快两年了。他终于找到了她，他会把她留在自己身边。”

然后他请明卿小姐坐下，把事情和盘托出，说得详详细细，一清二楚，让她明白，萨拉的前途已有保障，那笔误以为失去的财产已得到了十倍的补偿；此外，她还有卡里斯福特先生这位朋友和保护人。

明卿小姐并非聪明之人，她激动之余蠢得还想挣扎一番，妄图夺回认为原属自己的利益，而她的损失其实是由于她自己的势利和愚蠢造成的。

“全亏我照顾了她，他才找到她，”她反驳说，“我为她尽心竭力。要不是我她早就流落街头挨饿了。”

一听这话印度绅士就火冒三丈。

“说到流落街头挨饿，”他说，“这恐怕比在阁楼里挨饿要强三分。”

“是克鲁上尉把她交给了我照料的，”明卿小姐争辩道，“她成年前必须回到学校。她可以恢复做个特殊生。她必需完成学业。法律会维护我的权益。”

“得了，得了，明卿小姐，”卡迈克尔先生插言道，“这事法律可无能为力。若是萨拉自己愿意回到你身边，我敢说，卡里斯福特先生可能不会有异议。但是一切取决于萨拉自己。”

“那么，”明卿小姐说，“就听听萨拉的意思吧。我也许并没有娇惯你，”她对小女孩子说，显得有点尴尬，“但是你知道，你爸爸对你的进步是满意的。而且——嗯——我一向打心眼里喜欢你。”

萨拉那双灰绿色的眼睛盯着对方，那平静而澄澈的眼神是明卿小姐最受不了的。

“你喜欢我吗，明卿小姐？”她说，“我还没觉出来。”

这话说得明卿小姐脸孔变得通红，她把身子挺了起来。

“你应该觉得出来才是。”她说，“但不幸的是，小孩子从来就不知道好歹。我和艾米丽亚老说你是学校里最聪明的孩子。难道你就不为自己的爸爸负责，跟我一起回学校吗？”萨拉向前一步，一动不动地站在她面前。这时她想起了那一天，人家对她说，她已是个没人要的孩子，面临流落街头的危险；她想起了在阁楼里孤单地与爱米丽和梅基塞代克相处时挨饿受冻的日子。于是不禁神色坚定地看着明卿小姐。

“你是知道的：为什么我不跟你回家去，明卿小姐，”她说，“你非常清楚。”

明卿小姐那严厉而怒气冲冲的脸火辣辣的，涨得通红。

“你再也见不到自己的那些伙伴了，”她说，“我要看管好埃芒加德和洛蒂，不让她俩——”

卡迈克尔先生客气而又坚定地不让她说下去。

“对不起，”他说，“她想见谁就能见到谁。克鲁小姐同学的父母不太可能拒绝她邀请她们拜访监护人的家。卡里斯福特先生会作出安排的。”

应该承认，听了这话，甚至连明卿小姐也害怕三分。他这话比起她有位脾气古怪、一听到自己的侄女受虐待就发火的单身叔叔更难对付。但凡唯利是图的女人轻而易举会相信，大多数人是不会拒绝自己的孩子与拥有钻石矿的小继承人继续交朋友的。而且，如果卡里斯福特先生要把萨拉·克鲁的不幸遭受告诉自己的某些赞助人，势必要发生一些令人不快的事。

“你肩上的担子可不轻哪，”她转身离开房间时，对印度绅士说，“用不了多久你就明白我这话的。这孩子既不诚实，也不懂得知恩图报。看来，”她转而对萨拉说，“你现在又觉得自己是公主了。”

萨拉低下头，脸孔略略红了起来，因为在她看来自己最喜欢的幻想不是容易为陌生人——即使是善良的人——所理解的。

“我——本来就不想做别样的人，”她低声答道，“即使在我受饿挨冻最艰难的日子里——我也不想。”

“现在你可如愿以偿了。”拉姆·达斯行了个额手礼，送明卿小姐出房时，她酸溜溜地说。

明卿小姐回到家，来到自己的起居室，立即差人把艾米丽亚叫了来。这天下午余下的时间两个人一直在密谈。必须承认，可怜的艾米丽亚小姐受了不下一刻钟的罪，眼泪流了一大把，眼睛抹了无数遍。她说了一句不得体的话，气得姐姐差点没把她脑袋拧下来。不过这次密谈的结果却异乎寻常。

“我不像你那么聪明，姐姐，”她说，“我老担心说错话惹你生气。没准要是我胆子大些，反而对学校，也对你我有好处。我老寻思，要是你对萨拉·克鲁不那么狠心，让她穿得体面些、暖和些，结局没准不会这么糟。我知道，她那么一点大的孩子，干的活太重了，我也知道，她差不多是饿着肚子——”

“你怎么敢说这种话！”明卿小姐吼了起来。

“我也不知道怎么敢的，”艾米丽亚小姐答道，她这是硬着肚皮说开了，“可我豁出去了，已经说开了，干脆就说它个痛快。她是个聪明的孩子，心地也好——你对她好，她也会回报你的。可你对她一点也不好。事实上，你觉得她太聪明了，你比不上，所以就讨厌她。她可把咱俩看得一清二楚——”

“艾米丽亚！”姐姐气得直喘粗气，眼看着像是要扇她耳光、把她的便帽打落在地了。她经常这样对待贝基。

可艾米丽亚这时候已是怨气冲天，失去了理智，再也顾不得后果了。

“她就是！她就是！”她嚷嚷起来，“她把咱俩看透了。她看出你是个心肠硬又势利的女人，我呢，是个胆小怕事的傻瓜蛋，咱俩卑鄙粗俗，她有钱时下跪也愿意，她没钱时就作践她，可她呢，哪怕穷得像个叫花子时，一举一动仍然是位公主。她就是这样——就是这样——就像位小公主！”这可怜的女人一旦歇斯底里发作起来，又是哭又是笑的，身子摇来摆去，把明卿小姐吓得目瞪口呆。

“现在你失去了她，”她狂呼乱嚷起来，“别的学校就会收下她，得到她的钱。要是她像别的孩子那样，她就会抖搂出去，说自己如何受虐待，结果学校里的孩子全都被接走，咱俩就完蛋了。咱们这是自作自受，可比起我来，你是活该，因为你是个狠心的女人，玛丽亚·明卿——你心狠，自私又势利！”

她歇斯底里大发作，闹得气也喘不过来，喉咙里咕咕直响，大有天翻地覆之势，她姐姐赶紧去找嗅盐和碳酸氨，让她定下神来，哪顾得上为她的放肆而发火。

倒要提一句，从此以后，明卿小姐，这位做姐姐的，开始怕自己的妹妹几分了。做妹妹的，别看她傻里傻气，其实并不真的傻，她倒会脱口说出些别人不爱听的大实话来。

当天晚上，学生们在教室的炉火前聚集起来，这是上床前的惯例。这时埃芒加德手里拿了一封信，走了进来，圆圆的脸上露出一副奇特的神情。说她神情奇特，因为她激动又兴奋，同时又夹着几分惊讶，像是刚得到某种惊人的消息似的。

“怎么回事？”立即有两三个人大声问。

“不是和刚才那场吵闹有关吧？”拉维尼亚急不可待地问，“刚才明卿小姐房间里吵得闹翻了天，艾米丽亚小姐像是歇斯底里大发作，只得睡去了。”

埃芒加德慢声慢气地回答，像是人发愣了。

“我刚收到萨拉一封信。”她说着把信拿出来让大家看，好长的一封信。

“萨拉写的！”大家都齐声嚷了起来。

“她人在哪儿？”声音最尖的照例又是杰西。

“隔壁，”埃芒加德还是慢吞吞地说，“跟印度绅士在一起。”

“哪儿？哪儿？是被人打发去的吗？明卿小姐知不知道？这场吵闹为的是这事儿？她干吗要写信来？说呀！你说呀！”

简直要闹翻天了，洛蒂难过得都要哭鼻子了。

埃芒加德慢悠悠地回答起来，仿佛这是件极重要的，同时又是件不言自明的事，一时间她自己也像是有点儿卷进去说不清似的。

“钻石矿本来就有的，”她说得十分肯定，“本来就有的！”

她面前每一张嘴都张开来，每一双眼睛都睁大了。

“都是真的，”她急急忙忙说开了，“过去全搞错了。有一阵子是出了点事，卡里斯福特先生以为钻石矿完蛋了。”

“卡里斯福特先生是哪个？”杰西大声问。

“就是那印度绅士。克鲁上尉也信以为真——他死了。卡里斯福特先生害了脑炎，跑了，他差点也死了。他不知道萨拉在哪儿。结果发现矿里有千千万万的钻石。一半归萨拉所有。她待在阁楼里孤零零的，除了梅基塞代克没有一个朋友，厨娘对她指手画脚时，她就有那么多的钻石。今天下午卡里斯福特先生找到了她，让她留在自己的家里，她再也不回来了——比起过去来，她更像个公主了——十五万倍的像。明天下午我就去看她。等着瞧吧！”

这下那个闹腾劲儿就连明卿小姐恐怕也压不下去。她虽然听到了，也不想白费劲儿。艾米丽亚小姐倒在床上哭哭啼啼，房间里的事儿够她烦心的了，哪有心情面对这局面。她知道这消息通过神秘的方式从墙壁那边传过来了，每个仆人和孩子临睡前无不谈论这事儿。

所以直到半夜，整个寄宿学校不知怎么的，都意识到，一切规章制度全没人理会了，大家都围在埃芒加德身边，听她一再读信。这信里有个故事，这故事跟萨拉自己过去编的故事一样神奇，并且因为这故事发生在萨拉本人以及隔壁那位印度绅士身上更具有惊人的魅力。

贝基也听说了，便比平常早些偷偷上了楼。她想避开大家，再次看看这充满魔法的小房间。她拿不准这房间会发生什么变化。里面那些东西不太可能留给明卿小姐吧。要被搬走的，阁楼又要变得光秃秃、空荡荡的了。她虽然为萨拉而高兴，但一登上最后一级楼梯时，觉得喉咙里堵着一团东西，泪水模糊了她的眼睛。今晚不再有炉火了，粉红的灯光也不会亮了，不会有晚饭，公主也不再坐在炉火前朗读或讲故事了——不会有公主了！

她推开阁楼的房门，强迫自己不哭出来，不料她惊叫起来。

灯光照得房间亮堂堂的，炉火熊熊，晚饭也摆上了，拉姆·达斯笑吟吟地立在那儿冲着她那张吃惊的脸笑哩。

“尊贵的小姐记得你，”他说，“她对老爷全说了。她希望你也知道她碰到好运了。盘子里有一封信，是她写的。她不愿让你睡觉时伤心。老爷吩咐你明天上他那儿去。要你做尊贵的小姐的侍从。今晚我要把这些东西从屋顶搬回去。”

他笑吟吟地说了这些话后，行了额手礼，从天窗里悄无声息地溜了出去，行动敏捷，这下贝基明白了，以前他就是这样轻轻松松来去自如的。





十九　“安妮”


“大家庭”的儿童室里洋溢着前所未有的欢快气氛。他们做梦也没想到与“不是叫花子的小姑娘”亲密相识，会如此高兴。单是她的苦难和遭遇就使她成了无价之宝。人人都想一而再、再而三地听她讲述自己的经历。当你坐在明亮而宽敞的房间里温暖的炉火旁，听别人讲阁楼里彻骨的寒冷时，肯定是件莫大的乐事。必须承认，这间阁楼已成了大家乐于一去的地方了，每当你想起梅基塞代克，每当你爬上桌子，从天窗探出脑袋和肩膀，就听到麻雀的鸣叫，看到种种景色，阁楼里的寒冷和空荡荡的情景就显得微不足道了。

自然啰，最爱听的就是那次宴会和那梦想成真的故事了。萨拉被找到后的第二天，她第一次讲了这件事。“大家庭”的几名成员过来与她一起用茶。他们在壁炉前的地毯上或坐或蹲，萨拉就以她独特的方式讲了这事，印度绅士静静地听着。讲完后她就抬头看了看他，把自己的一只手放到他的膝盖上。

“这是我的那一部分故事，”她说，“现在你能不能讲讲你这方面呢，汤姆叔叔？”此前他要她一直唤自己“汤姆叔叔”，“我还不知道你是怎么做的呢，一准很好听的。”

于是他讲了，当自己在孤单地独坐时，身体有病，心情烦闷，脾气暴躁，拉姆·达斯给他讲过路人的事，以排遣烦恼，说有个孩子比别人更频繁地从窗前走过，这引起了他的兴趣——部分原因也许是他非常思念一个小女孩，部分是因为拉姆·达斯讲了他追逃跑的猴子到过阁楼的事。拉姆·达斯给他形象地讲了阁楼凄惨的情景和那孩子的举止，说她的身份不像是个做苦工的，可被当成苦力和女仆使唤了。拉姆·达斯慢慢地发现，她生活得十分悲惨。他发现从屋顶爬了几码就很容易到那天窗，从此引发了后来发生的事。

“老爷，”有一次他说，“在女孩子外出办事时，我可以爬过石板瓦，给她把炉子生起来。她回来看到炉火旺旺的，还以为是魔术师干的呢。”

卡里斯福特先生觉得这主意挺新奇，乐得愁云密布的脸上也露出灿烂的笑容来，拉姆·达斯更是心花怒放，进一步告诉东家说，再多做一些其他事也是不费吹灰之力的。他流露出小孩子般的快乐和想象力。他为实现自己的计划做了好几天的准备，原本是枯燥乏味的日子也变得生趣盎然了。就在举行那个惨遭破坏的宴会的晚上，拉姆·达斯始终密切注视着阁楼里的情况，所有准备送去的东西都放在他自己的阁楼里，他的助手也跟他一起等待机会，跟他一样，对这一古怪的历险也很有兴趣。拉姆·达斯身子一直趴在石板瓦上，注意天窗里的情况，直到宴会遭到灾难性的结局；他相信，萨拉已是精疲力竭，睡起来一定很沉。后来他带着遮光灯爬进了阁楼，他的助手则待在外面，把东西递给他。每遇到萨拉身子轻轻动了动，拉姆·达斯就关上遮光灯，身子直直地趴到地板上。以上及其他种种令人激动的情况都是经孩子们千百次的询问后才知道的。

“我太高兴了，”萨拉说，“我实在太高兴了，我的朋友原来就是你！”

从未有过这么好的一对朋友。不知怎么的，两个人出奇地投缘。印度绅士从来没有像喜欢萨拉那样喜欢过别的人。正如卡迈克尔先生预言的那样，不出一个月，卡里斯福特先生就换了个人似的。他整天乐呵呵的，兴致勃勃，过去他把财产看作是烦人的负担，如今发现那也是一大乐趣。他打算为萨拉做很多很多美妙的事。两个人开过小小的玩笑，他说自己是魔术师，为萨拉做些令她感到意外的事也成了他的一大乐趣。从此萨拉发现自己的房间里出现怒放的美丽鲜花，枕头下藏着稀奇古怪的小礼物。有一次傍晚，两个人在一起时，听到门上响起重重的爪子抓挠声，萨拉开门一看，原来外面立着一只大狗——一只漂亮的俄罗斯猎犬——挂着金银项圈，上面有凸起的文字。“我是鲍里斯，”上面写道，“专来伺候萨拉公主。”

印度绅士最爱回忆衣衫褴褛时的那位小公主。与“大家庭”或埃芒加德欢聚的下午往往是非常快乐的。但是萨拉和印度绅士独坐读书、谈天的时光，更有其独特的魅力。随着时光的流逝，发生了许多有趣的事。

一天傍晚，卡里斯福特先生从书本上抬起头来，发现自己的伙伴好一会儿身子一动不动，呆呆地凝视着炉火。

“你在‘假设’什么，萨拉？”他问。

萨拉抬起头，脸颊红通通的。

“我在想，”她说，“我在回忆那些挨饿的日子，想起一个我见过的孩子。”

“可你有过不少挨饿的日子，”印度绅士道，声调相当感伤，“到底是哪一天？”

“我忘了你还不知道呢。”萨拉说，“就是我梦想成真的那一天。”

于是她把面包铺的事说给他听，说到自己如何在泥浆里拾到四便士硬币，说到比自己还要饿的那个孩子。她说得很简单，只是寥寥数语。但是不知怎么的，印度绅士听了不觉用手掩住眼睛，垂下了头。

“我刚设想了一个计划，”讲完了这件事，最后她说，“我想我该做点事了。”

“什么事？”卡里斯福特先生低声问，“你想做什么都可以去做，公主。”

“我想，”萨拉有些拿不定主意，“你说，我有许多钱——我想能不能去见见那面包铺的老板娘，跟她说，如果挨饿的孩子——特别是遇到坏天气——到她家门前台阶上，或眼看着橱窗，她能不能把他们叫进去，给他们些吃的，费用可以由我来支付。我可以这么做吗？”

“明天早晨就可以去做。”印度绅士说。

“谢谢你，”萨拉说，“我懂挨饿的滋味，到了连‘假装’也假装不了时候，那日子真是太难受了。”

“是的，是的，宝贝，”印度绅士说，“是这样，是这样，一定是这样。设法忘了吧。过来，坐在我膝旁的小矮凳上，只记住你是位公主。”

“好，”萨拉笑着说，“我现在可以给平民百姓送各种面包了。”她说罢坐到小矮凳上，印度绅士（有时候他也喜欢她这样称呼自己）拉过她那满头黑发的小脑袋，靠在自己的膝盖上，抚摸着她的黑发。

第二天早晨，明卿小姐朝窗外张望时，看见了一件最不愿意看见的事。几匹高头大马拉着印度绅士的马车驶到隔壁家的大门前停下来，房主人和一个小孩子的身影，穿着暖和、柔软而艳丽的皮大衣，下了台阶，进了车。那小身影挺眼熟，使明卿小姐想起过去的一些日子。这个小孩子的身后还跟着一个人，也是挺眼熟的——一见就叫她生气。那小孩是贝基，看样子是名跟班，高高兴兴地总陪着小主人上下车，帮她拎包包，拿东西。贝基的脸蛋儿早已变得滚圆、红润了。

不一会儿，马车到了那面包铺的门前，车里的人下了车，你道怪不怪，就在这时候面包铺的老板娘正好也端着一盘热腾腾的小圆面包准备放进橱窗。

萨拉进了店，老板娘回头看了她一眼，放下面包，来到柜台后。她细细盯着萨拉看了看，那张善良的面孔容光焕发起来。

“我肯定记得你，小姐。”她说，“可——”

“不错，”萨拉说，“有一次我付了四便士，你给了我六便士的面包，并且——”

“可你把其中的五个给了小叫花子，”女老板打断了萨拉的话头，说，“我一直记得这件事。开始我还不明白到底是怎么一回事。”她转身对印度绅士，说了下面一段话，“我请你原谅，先生，关心挨饿小孩儿的年轻人可不多见。这事儿我想了好久。请不要见怪我说话放肆，小姐——”她转而对萨拉说，“如今您脸蛋儿红润多了——得，健康多了——比起——比起——”

“我是健康多了，谢谢你，”萨拉说，“而且也快活多了——我来是请你为我办件事。”

“要我，小姐！”老板娘开心地笑着，大声道，“老天爷，倒是什么事，小姐？”

萨拉背靠柜台讲了自己有关坏天气为饥饿的流浪儿提供热面包的小小建议。

女老板眼望着她，一脸吃惊的神色。

“唉哟哟，老天爷！”她听罢说道，“这种事要我干没说的。我自己是个干活的，太多的是没那个本钱，要说难处到处都有。不过不怕你笑话，自打那个湿淋淋的下午以后，我施舍了不少面包，都是想到你的缘故——那时瞧你浑身湿透，又冷又饿，可你把自己的热面包给了别人，活像个公主。”

印度绅士听了禁不住笑了，萨拉想起了自己把小圆面包放到饥肠辘辘的小孩裹着破布的膝盖上时说的话，也微微露出了笑容。

“她看上去饿极了，”她说，“甚至比我还饿。”

“她确实饿坏了，”老板娘说，“好多次，风雨天她坐在那儿，跟我说过，像是有条饿狼在撕咬她的幼小的五脏六腑。”

“哦，自那以后你见过她吗？”萨拉大声问，“你知道她在哪儿吗？”

“知道，知道，”女老板笑道，显得越发善良了，“这不，她就在后间，小姐，她来了都一个月了。她会出落成个不错的好孩子的。她可成了我店里厨房的好帮手哩。简直不会相信她以前过的是什么日子。”

她说罢走到后间的门前，说了句什么话，很快一个小女孩走了出来，跟着她到了柜台后。她确是那个小叫花子，穿得干干净净、整整齐齐的，看起来不像是个长期挨过饿的。她有点害羞，可脸蛋儿挺可人的，既然不再过流浪的生活了，眼神里的那股野性也不见了。她一下子就认出萨拉来，站在那儿一个劲朝萨拉看，好像看不够似的。

“你瞧，”老板娘说，“当时我跟她说，要是饿了就上我这儿来，她一来我就让她干点零活。看得出她倒乐意，我也就慢慢喜欢上她了，最后我就让她干点活，给她一个住处。她做了我的帮手，表现得挺不错，小小的年纪，还懂得知恩图报呢。她叫安妮。不知道姓什么。”

两个孩子好一会儿站着你望我、我望你。最后萨拉把手从暖手筒里抽出来，伸过柜台，安妮接住握起来，两双眼睛紧紧地对视起来。

“我太高兴了，”萨拉说，“我刚想到一个主意。也许布朗太太让你负责给小孩子分发面包。也许你喜欢做这件事，因为你懂得挨饿的滋味。”

“是的，小姐。”小姑娘说。

不知怎么的，萨拉觉得小姑娘是了解自己的，虽然对方话没说几句，只是一声不吭站着打量自己，最后看着自己和印度绅士走出店铺，上了马车，离开了。





CHAPTER Ⅰ　SARA


ONCE on a dark winter's day, when the yellow fog hung so thick and heavy in the streets of London that the lamps were lighted and the shop windows blazed with gas as they do at night, an odd - looking little girl sat in a cab with her father and was driven rather slowly through the big thoroughfares.

She sat with her feet tucked under her, and leaned against her father, who held her in his arm, as she stared out of the window at the passing people with a queer old - fashioned thoughtfulness in her big eyes.

She was such a little girl that one did not expect to see such a look on her small face. It would have been an old look for a child of twelve, and Sara Crewe was only seven. The fact was, however, that she was always dreaming and thinking odd things and could not herself remember any time when she had not been thinking things about grown - up people and the world they belonged to. She felt as if she had lived a long, long time.

At this moment she was remembering the voyage she had just made from Bombay with her father, Captain Crewe. She was thinking of the big ship, of the Lascars passing silently to and fro on it, of the children playing about on the hot deck, and of some young officers' wives who used to try to make her talk to them and laugh at the things she said.

Principally, she was thinking of what a queer thing it was that at one time one was in India in the blazing sun, and then in the middle of the ocean, and then driving in a strange vehicle through strange streets where the day was as dark as the night. She found this so puzzling that she moved closer to her father.

" Papa, " she said in a low, mysterious little voice which was almost a whisper, " papa. "

" What is it, darling? " Captain Crewe answered, holding her closer and looking down into her face. " What is Sara thinking of? "

" Is this the place? " Sara whispered, cuddling still closer to him. " Is it, papa? "

" Yes, little Sara, it is. We have reached it at last. " And though she was only seven years old, she knew that he felt sad when he said it.

It seemed to her many years since he had begun to prepare her mind for " the place, " as she always called it. Her mother had died when she was born, so she had never known or missed her. Her young, handsome, rich, petting father seemed to be the only relation she had in the world. They had always played together and been fond of each other. She only knew he was rich because she had heard people say so when they thought she was not listening, and she had also heard them say that when she grew up she would be rich, too. She did not know all that being rich meant. She had always lived in a beautiful bungalow, and had been used to seeing many servants who made salaams to her and called her " Missee Sahib, " and gave her her own way in everything. She had had toys and pets and an ayah who worshipped her, and she had gradually learned that people who were rich had these things. That, however, was all she knew about it.

During her short life only one thing had troubled her, and that thing was " the place " she was to be taken to some day. The climate of India was very bad for children, and as soon as possible they were sent away from it - generally to England and to school. She had seen other children go away, and had heard their fathers and mothers talk about the letters they received from them. She had known that she would be obliged to go also, and though sometimes her father's stories of the voyage and the new country had attracted her, she had been troubled by the thought that he could not stay with her.

" Couldn' t you go to that place with me, papa? " she had asked when she was five years old. " Couldn' t you go to school, too? I would help you with your lessons. "

" But you will not have to stay for a very long time, little Sara, " he had always said. " You will go to a nice house where there will be a lot of little girls, and you will play together, and I will send you plenty of books, and you will grow so fast that it will seem scarcely a year before you are big enough and clever enough to come back and take care of papa. "

She had liked to think of that. To keep the house for her father; to ride with him, and sit at the head of his table when he had dinner parties; to talk to him and read his books - that would be what she would like most in the world, and if one must go away to " the place " in England to attain it, she must make up her mind to go. She did not care very much for other little girls, but if she had plenty of books she could console herself. She liked books more than anything else, and was, in fact, always inventing stories of beautiful things and telling them to herself. Sometimes she had told them to her father, and he had liked them as much as she did.

" Well, papa, " she said softly, " If we are here I suppose we must be resigned. "

He laughed at her old - fashioned speech and kissed her. He was really not at all resigned himself, though he knew he must keep that a secret. His quaint little Sara had been a great companion to him, and he felt he should be a lonely fellow when, on his return to India, he went into his bungalow knowing he need not expect to see the small figure in its white frock come forward to meet him. So he held her very closely in his arm as the cab rolled into the big, dull square in which stood the house which was their destination.

It was a big, dull, brick house, exactly like all the others in its row, but that on the front door there shone a brass plate on which was engraved in black letters:

MISS MINCHIN,

Select Seminary for Young Ladies.

" Here we are, Sara, " said Captain Crewe, making his voice sound as cheerful as possible. Then he lifted her out of the cab and they mounted the steps and rang the bell. Sara often thought afterward that the house was somehow exactly like Miss Minchin. It was respectable and well furnished, but everything in it was ugly; and the very armchairs seemed to have hard bones in them. In the hall everything was hard and polished - even the red cheeks of the moon face on the tall clock in the corner had a severe varnished look. The drawing - room into which they were ushered was covered by a carpet with a square pattern upon it, the chairs were square, and a heavy marble timepiece stood upon the heavy marble mantel.

As she sat down in one of the stiff mahogany chairs, Sara cast one of her quick looks about her.

" I don' t like it, papa, " she said. " But then I dare say soldiers - even brave ones - don' t really LIKE going into battle. "

Captain Crewe laughed outright at this. He was young and full of fun, and he never tired of hearing Sara's queer speeches.

" Oh, little Sara, " he said. " What shall I do when I have no one to say solemn things to me? No one else is quite as solemn as you are. "

" But why do solemn things make you laugh so? " inquired Sara.

" Because you are such fun when you say them, " he answered, laughing still more. And then suddenly he swept her into his arms and kissed her very hard, stopping laughing all at once and looking almost as if tears had come into his eyes.

It was just then that Miss Minchin entered the room. She was very like her house, Sara felt: tall and dull, and respectable and ugly. She had large, cold, fishy eyes, and a large, cold, fishy smile. It spread itself into a very large smile when she saw Sara and Captain Crewe. She had heard a great many desirable things of the young soldier from the lady who had recommended her school to him. Among other things, she had heard that he was a rich father who was willing to spend a great deal of money on his little daughter.

" It will be a great privilege to have charge of such a beautiful and promising child, Captain Crewe, " she said, taking Sara's hand and stroking it. " Lady Meredith has told me of her unusual cleverness. A clever child is a great treasure in an establishment like mine. "

Sara stood quietly, with her eyes fixed upon Miss Minchin's face. She was thinking something odd, as usual.

" Why does she say I am a beautiful child? " she was thinking. " I am not beautiful at all. Colonel Grange's little girl, Isobel, is beautiful. She has dimples and rose - colored cheeks, and long hair the color of gold. I have short black hair and green eyes; besides which, I am a thin child and not fair in the least. I am one of the ugliest children I ever saw. She is beginning by telling a story. "

She was mistaken, however, in thinking she was an ugly child. She was not in the least like Isobel Grange, who had been the beauty of the regiment, but she had an odd charm of her own. She was a slim, supple creature, rather tall for her age, and had an intense, attractive little face. Her hair was heavy and quite black and only curled at the tips; her eyes were greenish gray, it is true, but they were big, wonderful eyes with long, black lashes, and though she herself did not like the color of them, many other people did. Still she was very firm in her belief that she was an ugly little girl, and she was not at all elated by Miss Minchin's flattery.

" I should be telling a story if I said she was beautiful, " she thought; " And I should know I was telling a story. I believe I am as ugly as she is - in my way. What did she say that for? "

After she had known Miss Minchin longer she learned why she had said it. She discovered that she said the same thing to each papa and mamma who brought a child to her school.

Sara stood near her father and listened while he and Miss Minchin talked. She had been brought to the seminary because Lady Meredith's two little girls had been educated there, and Captain Crewe had a great respect for Lady Meredith's experience. Sara was to be what was known as " A parlor boarder, " and she was to enjoy even greater privileges than parlor boarders usually did. She was to have a pretty bedroom and sitting - room of her own; she was to have a pony and a carriage, and a maid to take the place of the ayah who had been her nurse in India.

" I am not in the least anxious about her education, " Captain Crewe said, with his gay laugh, as he held Sara's hand and patted it. " The difficulty will be to keep her from learning too fast and too much. She is always sitting with her little nose burrowing into books. She doesn' t read them, Miss Minchin; she gobbles them up as if she were a little wolf instead of a little girl. She is always starving for new books to gobble, and she wants grown - up books - great, big, fat ones - French and German as well as English - history and biography and poets, and all sorts of things. Drag her away from her books when she reads too much. Make her ride her pony in the Row or go out and buy a new doll. She ought to play more with dolls. "

" Papa, " said Sara. " you see, if I went out and bought a new doll every few days I should have more than I could be fond of. Dolls ought to be intimate friends. Emily is going to be my intimate friend. "

Captain Crewe looked at Miss Minchin and Miss Minchin looked at Captain Crewe.

" Who is Emily? " she inquired.

" Tell her, Sara, " Captain Crewe said, smiling.

Sara's green - gray eyes looked very solemn and quite soft as she answered.

" She is a doll I haven' t got yet, " she said. " She is a doll papa is going to buy for me. We are going out together to find her. I have called her Emily. She is going to be my friend when papa is gone. I want her to talk to about him. "

Miss Minchin's large, fishy smile became very flattering indeed.

" What an original child! " she said. " What a darling little creature! "

" Yes, " said Captain Crewe, drawing Sara close. " She is a darling little creature. Take great care of her for me, Miss Minchin. "

Sara stayed with her father at his hotel for several days; in fact, she remained with him until he sailed away again to India. They went out and visited many big shops together, and bought a great many things. They bought, indeed, a great many more things than Sara needed; but Captain Crewe was a rash, innocent young man and wanted his little girl to have everything she admired and everything he admired himself, so between them they collected a wardrobe much too grand for a child of seven. There were velvet dresses trimmed with costly furs, and lace dresses, and embroidered ones, and hats with great, soft ostrich feathers, and ermine coats and muffs, and boxes of tiny gloves and handkerchiefs and silk stockings in such abundant supplies that the polite young women behind the counters whispered to each other that the odd little girl with the big, solemn eyes must be at least some foreign princess - perhaps the little daughter of an Indian rajah.

And at last they found Emily, but they went to a number of toy - shops and looked at a great many dolls before they finally discovered her.

" I want her to look as if she wasn' t a doll really, " Sara said. " I want her to look as if she LISTENS when I talk to her. The trouble with dolls, papa " - and she put her head on one side and reflected as she said it - " The trouble with dolls is that they never seem to HEAR. " So they looked at big ones and little ones - at dolls with black eyes and dolls with blue - at dolls with brown curls and dolls with golden braids, dolls dressed and dolls undressed.

" You see, " Sara said when they were examining one who had no clothes. " If, when I find her, she has no frocks, we can take her to a dressmaker and have her things made to fit. They will fit better if they are tried on. "

After a number of disappointments they decided to walk and look in at the shop windows and let the cab follow them. They had passed two or three places without even going in, when, as they were approaching a shop which was really not a very large one, Sara suddenly started and clutched her father's arm.

" Oh, papa! " she cried. " There is Emily! "

A flush had risen to her face and there was an expression in her green - gray eyes as if she had just recognized someone she was intimate with and fond of.

" She is actually waiting for us! " she said. " Let us go in to her. "

" Dear me! " said Captain Crewe, " I feel as if we ought to have some - one to introduce us. "

" You must introduce me and I will introduce you, " said Sara. " But I knew her the minute I saw her - so perhaps she knew me, too. "

Perhaps she had known her. She had certainly a very intelligent expression in her eyes when Sara took her in her arms. She was a large doll, but not too large to carry about easily; she had naturally curling golden - brown hair, which hung like a mantle about her, and her eyes were a deep, clear, gray blue, with soft, thick eyelashes which were real eyelashes and not mere painted lines.

" Of course, " said Sara, looking into her face as she held her on her knee - " Of course, papa, this is Emily. "

So Emily was bought and actually taken to a children's outfitter's shop, and measured for a wardrobe as grand as Sara's own. She had lace frocks, too, and velvet and muslin ones, and hats and coats and beautiful lace - trimmed underclothes, and gloves and handkerchiefs and furs.

" I should like her always to look as if she was a child with a good mother, " said Sara. " I' m her mother, though I am going to make a companion of her. "

Captain Crewe would really have enjoyed the shopping tremendously, but that a sad thought kept tugging at his heart. This all meant that he was going to be separated from his beloved, quaint little comrade.

He got out of his bed in the middle of that night and went and stood looking down at Sara, who lay asleep with Emily in her arms. Her black hair was spread out on the pillow and Emily's golden - brown hair mingled with it, both of them had lace - ruffled night - gowns, and both had long eyelashes which lay and curled up on their cheeks. Emily looked so like a real child that Captain Crewe felt glad she was there. He drew a big sigh and pulled his mustache with a boyish expression.

" Heigh - ho, little Sara! " he said to himself. " I don' t believe you know how much your daddy will miss you. "

The next day he took her to Miss Minchin's and left her there. He was to sail away the next morning. He explained to Miss Minchin that his solicitors, Messrs. Barrow& Skipworth, had charge of his affairs in England and would give her any advice she wanted, and that they would pay the bills she sent in for Sara's expenses. He would write to Sara twice a week, and she was to be given every pleasure she asked for.

" She is a sensible little thing, and she never wants anything it isn' t safe to give her, " he said.

Then he went with Sara into her little sitting - room and they bade each other good - by. Sara sat on his knee and held the lapels of his coat in her small hands, and looked long and hard at his face.

" Are you learning me by heart, little Sara? " he said, stroking her hair.

" No, " she answered. " I know you by heart. You are inside my heart. " And they put their arms round each other and kissed as if they would never let each other go.

When the cab drove away from the door, Sara was sitting on the floor of her sitting - room, with her hands under her chin and her eyes following it until it had turned the corner of the square. Emily was sitting by her, and she looked after it, too. When Miss Minchin sent her sister, Miss Amelia, to see what the child was doing, she found she could not open the door.

" I have locked it, " said a queer, polite little voice from inside. " I want to be quite by myself, if you please. "

Miss Amelia was fat and dumpy, and stood very much in awe of her sister. She was really the better - natured person of the two, but she never disobeyed Miss Minchin. She went downstairs again, looking almost alarmed.

" I never saw such a funny old - fashioned child, sister, " she said. " She has locked herself in, and she is not making the least particle of noise. "

" It is much better than if she kicked and screamed, as some of them do, " Miss Minchin answered. " I expected that a child as much spoiled as she is would set the whole house in an uproar. If ever a child was given her own way in everything, she is. "

" I' ve been opening her trunks and putting her things away, " said Miss Amelia. " I never saw anything like them - sable and ermine on her coats, and real Valenciennes lace on her underclothing. You have seen some of her clothes. What DO you think of them? "

" I think they are perfectly ridiculous, " replied Miss Minchin, sharply; " But they will look very well at the head of the line when we take the school - children to church on Sunday. She has been provided for as if she were a little princess. "

And upstairs in the locked room Sara and Emily sat on the floor and stared at the corner round which the cab had disappeared, while Captain Crewe looked backward, waving and kissing his hand as if he could not bear to stop.





CHAPTER Ⅱ　A FRENCH LESSON


WHEN Sara entered the schoolroom the next morning everybody looked at her with wide, interested eyes. By that time every pupil - from Lavinia Herbert, who was nearly thirteen and felt quite grown up, to Lottie Legh, who was only just four and the baby of the school - had heard a great deal about her. They knew very certainly that she was Miss Minchin's show pupil and was considered a credit to the establishment. One or two of them had even caught a glimpse of her French maid, Mariette, who had arrived the evening before. Lavinia had managed to pass Sara's room when the door was open, and had seen Mariette opening a box which had arrived late from some shop.

" It was full of petticoats with lace frills on them - frills and frills, " she whispered to her friend Jessie as she bent over her geography. " I saw her shaking them out. I heard Miss Minchin say to Miss Amelia that her clothes were so grand that they were ridiculous for a child. My mamma says that children should be dressed simply. She has got one of those petticoats on now. I saw it when she sat down. "

" She has silk stockings on! " whispered Jessie, bending over her geography also. " And what little feet! I never saw such little feet. "

" Oh, " sniffed Lavinia, spitefully, " that is the way her slippers are made. My mamma says that even big feet can be made to look small if you have a clever shoemaker. I don' t think she is pretty at all. Her eyes are such a queer color. "

" She isn' t pretty as other pretty people are, " said Jessie, stealing a glance across the room; " But she makes you want to look at her again. She has tremendously long eyelashes, but her eyes are almost green. "

Sara was sitting quietly in her seat, waiting to be told what to do. She had been placed near Miss Minchin's desk. She was not abashed at all by the many pairs of eyes watching her. She was interested and looked back quietly at the children who looked at her. She wondered what they were thinking of, and if they liked Miss Minchin, and if they cared for their lessons, and if any of them had a papa at all like her own. She had had a long talk with Emily about her papa that morning.

" He is on the sea now, Emily, " she had said. " We must be very great friends to each other and tell each other things. Emily, look at me. You have the nicest eyes I ever saw - but I wish you could speak. "

She was a child full of imaginings and whimsical thoughts, and one of her fancies was that there would be a great deal of comfort in even pretending that Emily was alive and really heard and understood. After Mariette had dressed her in her dark - blue schoolroom frock and tied her hair with a dark - blue ribbon, she went to Emily, who sat in a chair of her own, and gave her a book.

" You can read that while I am downstairs, " she said; and, seeing Mariette looking at her curiously, she spoke to her with a serious little face.

" What I believe about dolls, " she said, " Is that they can do things they will not let us know about. Perhaps, really, Emily can read and talk and walk, but she will only do it when people are out of the room. That is her secret. You see, if people knew that dolls could do things, they would make them work. So, perhaps, they have promised each other to keep it a secret. If you stay in the room, Emily will just sit there and stare; but if you go out, she will begin to read, perhaps, or go and look out of the window. Then if she heard either of us coming, she would just run back and jump into her chair and pretend she had been there all the time. "

" Comme elle est dr? le! " Mariette said to herself, and when she went downstairs she told the head housemaid about it. But she had already begun to like this odd little girl who had such an intelligent small face and such perfect manners. She had taken care of children before who were not so polite. Sara was a very fine little person, and had a gentle, appreciative way of saying, " If you please, Mariette, " " Thank you, Mariette, " which was very charming. Mariette told the head housemaid that she thanked her as if she was thanking a lady.

" Elle a l' air d' une princesse, cette petite, " she said. Indeed, she was very much pleased with her new little mistress and liked her place greatly.

After Sara had sat in her seat in the schoolroom for a few minutes, being looked at by the pupils, Miss Minchin rapped in a dignified manner upon her desk.

" Young ladies, " she said, " I wish to introduce you to your new companion. " All the little girls rose in their places, and Sara rose also. " I shall expect you all to be very agreeable to Miss Crewe; she has just come to us from a great distance - in fact, from India. As soon as lessons are over you must make each other's acquaintance. "

The pupils bowed ceremoniously, and Sara made a little courtesy, and then they sat down and looked at each other again.

" Sara, " said Miss Minchin in her schoolroom manner, " Come here to me. "

She had taken a book from the desk and was turning over its leaves. Sara went to her politely.

" As your papa has engaged a French maid for you, " she began, " I conclude that he wishes you to make a special study of the French language. "

Sara felt a little awkward.

" I think he engaged her, " she said, " Because he - he thought I would like her, Miss Minchin. "

" I am afraid, " said Miss Minchin, with a slightly sour smile, " that you have been a very spoiled little girl and always imagine that things are done because you like them. My impression is that your papa wished you to learn French. "

If Sara had been older or less punctilious about being quite polite to people, she could have explained herself in a very few words. But, as it was, she felt a flush rising on her cheeks. Miss Minchin was a very severe and imposing person, and she seemed so absolutely sure that Sara knew nothing whatever of French that she felt as if it would be almost rude to correct her. The truth was that Sara could not remember the time when she had not seemed to know French. Her father had often spoken it to her when she had been a baby. Her mother had been a French woman, and Captain Crewe had loved her language, so it happened that Sara had always heard and been familiar with it.

" I - I have never really learned French, but - but - " she began, trying shyly to make herself clear.

One of Miss Minchin's chief secret annoyances was that she did not speak French herself, and was desirous of concealing the irritating fact. She, therefore, had no intention of discussing the matter and laying herself open to innocent questioning by a new little pupil.

" That is enough, " she said with polite tartness. " If you have not learned, you must begin at once. The French master, Monsieur Dufarge, will be here in a few minutes. Take this book and look at it until he arrives. "

Sara's cheeks felt warm. She went back to her seat and opened the book. She looked at the first page with a grave face. She knew it would be rude to smile, and she was very determined not to be rude. But it was very odd to find herself expected to study a page which told her that " le père " meant " the father, " and " la mère " meant " the mother. "

Miss Minchin glanced toward her scrutinizingly.

" You look rather cross, Sara, " she said. " I am sorry you do not like the idea of learning French. "

" I am very fond of it, " answered Sara, thinking she would try again; " but - "

" You must not say' but' when you are told to do things, " said Miss Minchin. " Look at your book again. "

And Sara did so, and did not smile, even when she found that " le fils " meant " the son, " and " le frère " meant " the brother. "

" When Monsieur Dufarge comes, " she thought, " I can make him understand. "

Monsieur Dufarge arrived very shortly afterward. He was a very nice, intelligent, middle - aged Frenchman, and he looked interested when his eyes fell upon Sara trying politely to seem absorbed in her little book of phrases.

" Is this a new pupil for me, madame? " he said to Miss Minchin. " I hope that is my good fortune. "

" Her papa - Captain Crewe - is very anxious that she should begin the language. But I am afraid she has a childish prejudice against it. She does not seem to wish to learn, " said Miss Minchin.

" I am sorry of that, mademoiselle, " he said kindly to Sara. " Perhaps, when we begin to study together, I may show you that it is a charming tongue. "

Little Sara rose in her seat. She was beginning to feel rather desperate, as if she were almost in disgrace. She looked up into Monsieur Dufarge's face with her big, green - gray eyes, and they were quite innocently appealing. She knew that he would understand as soon as she spoke. She began to explain quite simply in pretty and fluent French. Madame had not understood. She had not learned French exactly - not out of books - but her papa and other people had always spoken it to her, and she had read it and written it as she had read and written English. Her papa loved it, and she loved it because he did. Her dear mamma, who had died when she was born, had been French. She would be glad to learn anything monsieur would teach her, but what she had tried to explain to madame was that she already knew the words in this book - and she held out the little book of phrases.

When she began to speak Miss Minchin started quite violently and sat staring at her over her eye - glasses, almost indignantly, until she had finished. Monsieur Dufarge began to smile, and his smile was one of great pleasure. To hear this pretty childish voice speaking his own language so simply and charmingly made him feel almost as if he were in his native land - which in dark, foggy days in London sometimes seemed worlds away. When she had finished, he took the phrase book from her, with a look almost affectionate. But he spoke to Miss Minchin.

" Ah, madame, " he said, " There is not much I can teach her. She has not LEARNED French; she is French. Her accent is exquisite. "

" You ought to have told me, " exclaimed Miss Minchin, much mortified, turning on Sara.

" I - I tried, " said Sara. " I - I suppose I did not begin right. "

Miss Minchin knew she had tried, and that it had not been her fault that she was not allowed to explain. And when she saw that the pupils had been listening and that Lavinia and Jessie were giggling behind their French grammars, she felt infuriated.

" Silence, young ladies! " she said severely, rapping upon the desk. " Silence at once! "

And she began from that minute to feel rather a grudge against her show pupil.





CHAPTER Ⅲ　ERMENGARDE


ON that first morning, when Sara sat at Miss Minchin's side, aware that the whole schoolroom was devoting itself to observing her, she had noticed very soon one little girl, about her own age, who looked at her very hard with a pair of light, rather dull, blue eyes. She was a fat child who did not look as if she were in the least clever, but she had a good - naturedly pouting mouth. Her flaxen hair was braided in a tight pigtail, tied with a ribbon, and she had pulled this pigtail round her neck, and was biting the end of the ribbon, resting her elbows on the desk, as she stared wonderingly at the new pupil. When Monsieur Dufarge began to speak to Sara, she looked a little frightened; and when Sara stepped forward and, looking at him with the innocent, appealing eyes, answered him, without any warning, in French, the fat little girl gave a startled jump, and grew quite red in her awed amazement. Having wept hopeless tears for weeks in her efforts to remember that " la mère " meant " the mother, " and " le père " " the father, " - when one spoke sensible English - it was almost too much for her to suddenly find herself listening to a child her own age who seemed not only quite familiar with these words, but apparently knew any number of others, and could mix them up with verbs as if they were mere trifles.

She stared so hard and bit the ribbon on her pigtail so fast that she attracted the attention of Miss Minchin, who, feeling extremely cross at the moment, immediately pounced upon her.

" Miss St. John! " she exclaimed severely. " What do you mean by such conduct? Remove your elbows! Take your ribbon out of your mouth! Sit up at once! "

Upon which Miss St. John gave another jump, and when Lavinia and Jessie tittered she became redder than ever - so red, indeed, that she almost looked as if tears were coming into her poor, dull, childish eyes; and Sara saw her and was so sorry for her that she began to rather like her and want to be her friend. It was a way of hers always to want to spring into any fray in which someone was made uncomfortable or unhappy.

" If Sara had been a boy and lived a few centuries ago, " her father used to say, " She would have gone about the country with her sword drawn, rescuing and defending everyone in distress. She always wants to fight when she sees people in trouble. "

So she took rather a fancy to fat, slow, little Miss St. John, and kept glancing toward her through the morning. She saw that lessons were no easy matter to her, and that there was no danger of her ever being spoiled by being treated as a show pupil. Her French lesson was a pathetic thing. Her pronunciation made even Monsieur Dufarge smile in spite of himself, and Lavinia and Jessie and the more fortunate girls either giggled or looked at her in wondering disdain. But Sara did not laugh. She tried to look as if she did not hear when Miss St. John called " le bon pain " " lee bong pang. " She had a fine, hot little temper of her own, and it made her feel rather savage when she heard the titters and saw the poor, stupid, distressed child's face.

" It isn' t funny, really, " she said between her teeth, as she bent over her book. " They ought not to laugh. "

When lessons were over and the pupils gathered together in groups to talk, Sara looked for Miss St. John, and finding her bundled rather disconsolately in a window - seat, she walked over to her and spoke. She only said the kind of thing little girls always say to each other by way of beginning an acquaintance, but there was something nice and friendly about Sara, and people always felt it.

" What is your name? " she said.

To explain Miss St. John's amazement one must recall that a new pupil is, for a short time, a somewhat uncertain thing; and of this new pupil the entire school had talked the night before until it fell asleep quite exhausted by excitement and contradictory stories. A new pupil with a carriage and a pony and a maid, and a voyage from India to discuss, was not an ordinary acquaintance.

" My name's Ermengarde St. John, " she answered.

" Mine is Sara Crewe, " said Sara. " Yours is very pretty. It sounds like a story book. "

" Do you like it? " fluttered Ermengarde. " I - I like yours. "

Miss St. John's chief trouble in life was that she had a clever father. Sometimes this seemed to her a dreadful calamity. If you have a father who knows everything, who speaks seven or eight languages, and has thousands of volumes which he has apparently learned by heart, he frequently expects you to be familiar with the contents of your lesson books at least; and it is not improbable that he will feel you ought to be able to remember a few incidents of history and to write a French exercise. Ermengarde was a severe trial to Mr. St. John. He could not understand how a child of his could be a notably and unmistakably dull creature who never shone in anything.

" Good heavens! " he had said more than once, as he stared at her, " There are times when I think she is as stupid as her Aunt Eliza! "

If her Aunt Eliza had been slow to learn and quick to forget a thing entirely when she had learned it, Ermengarde was strikingly like her. She was the monumental dunce of the school, and it could not be denied.

" She must be MADE to learn, " her father said to Miss Minchin.

Consequently Ermengarde spent the greater part of her life in disgrace or in tears. She learned things and forgot them; or, if she remembered them, she did not understand them. So it was natural that, having made Sara's acquaintance, she should sit and stare at her with profound admiration.

" You can speak French, can' t you? " she said respectfully.

Sara got on to the window - seat, which was a big, deep one, and, tucking up her feet, sat with her hands clasped round her knees.

" I can speak it because I have heard it all my life, " she answered. " You could speak it if you had always heard it. "

" Oh, no, I couldn' t, " said Ermengarde. " I NEVER could speak it! "

" Why? " inquired Sara, curiously.

Ermengarde shook her head so that the pigtail wabbled.

" You heard me just now, " she said. " I' m always like that. I can' t SAY the words. They' re so queer. "

She paused a moment, and then added with a touch of awe in her voice:

" You are CLEVER, aren' t you? "

Sara looked out of the window into the dingy square, where the sparrows were hopping and twittering on the wet, iron railings and the sooty branches of the trees. She reflected a few moments. She had heard it said very often that she was " Clever, " and she wondered if she was - and IF she was, how it had happened.

" I don' t know, " she said. " I can' t tell. " Then, seeing a mournful look on the round, chubby face, she gave a little laugh and changed the subject.

" Would you like to see Emily? " she inquired.

" Who is Emily? " Ermengarde asked, just as Miss Minchin had done.

" Come up to my room and see, " said Sara, holding out her hand.

They jumped down from the window - seat together, and went up - stairs.

" Is it true, " Ermengarde whispered, as they went through the hall - " Is it true that you have a play - room all to yourself? "

" Yes, " Sara answered. " Papa asked Miss Minchin to let me have one, because - well, it was because when I play I make up stories and tell them to myself, and I don' t like people to hear me. It spoils it if I think people listen. "

They had reached the passage leading to Sara's room by this time, and Ermengarde stopped short, staring, and quite losing her breath.

" You MAKE up stories! " she gasped. " Can you do that - as well as speak French? CAN you? "

Sara looked at her in simple surprise.

" Why, anyone can make up things, " she said. " Have you never tried? "

She put her hand warningly on Ermengarde's.

" Let us go very quietly to the door, " she whispered, " And then I will open it quite suddenly; perhaps we may catch her. "

She was half laughing, but there was a touch of mysterious hope in her eyes which fascinated Ermengarde, though she had not the remotest idea what it meant, or whom it was she wanted to " catch, " or why she wanted to catch her. Whatsoever she meant, Ermengarde was sure it was something delightfully exciting. So, quite thrilled with expectation, she followed her on tiptoe along the passage. They made not the least noise until they reached the door. Then Sara suddenly turned the handle, and threw it wide open. Its opening revealed the room quite neat and quiet, a fire gently burning in the grate, and a wonderful doll sitting in a chair by it, apparently reading a book.

" Oh, she got back to her seat before we could see her! " Sara exclaimed. " Of course they always do. They are as quick as lightning. "

Ermengarde looked from her to the doll and back again.

" Can she - walk? " she asked breathlessly.

" Yes, " answered Sara. " At least I believe she can. At least I PRETEND I believe she can. And that makes it seem as if it were true. Have you never pretended things? "

" No, " said Ermengarde. " Never. I - tell me about it. "

She was so bewitched by this odd, new companion that she actually stared at Sara instead of at Emily - notwithstanding that Emily was the most attractive doll person she had ever seen.

" Let us sit down, " said Sara, " and I will tell you. It's so easy that when you begin you can' t stop. You just go on and on doing it always. And it's beautiful. Emily, you must listen. This is Ermengarde St. John, Emily. Ermengarde, this is Emily. Would you like to hold her? "

" Oh, may I? " said Ermengarde. " May I, really? She is beautiful! " And Emily was put into her arms.

Never in her dull, short life had Miss St. John dreamed of such an hour as the one she spent with the queer new pupil before they heard the lunch - bell ring and were obliged to go downstairs.

Sara sat upon the hearth - rug and told her strange things. She sat rather huddled up, and her green eyes shone and her cheeks flushed. She told stories of the voyage, and stories of India; but what fascinated Ermengarde the most was her fancy about the dolls who walked and talked, and who could do anything they chose when the human beings were out of the room, but who must keep their powers a secret and so flew back to their places " like lightning " when people returned to the room.

" WE couldn' t do it, " said Sara, seriously. " You see, it's a kind of magic. "

Once, when she was relating the story of the search for Emily, Ermengarde saw her face suddenly change. A cloud seemed to pass over it and put out the light in her shining eyes. She drew her breath in so sharply that it made a funny, sad little sound, and then she shut her lips and held them tightly closed, as if she was determined either to do or NOT to do something. Ermengarde had an idea that if she had been like any other little girl, she might have suddenly burst out sobbing and crying. But she did not.

" Have you a - a pain? " Ermengarde ventured.

" Yes, " Sara answered, after a moment's silence. " But it is not in my body. " Then she added something in a low voice which she tried to keep quite steady, and it was this: " Do you love your father more than anything else in all the whole world? "

Ermengarde's mouth fell open a little. She knew that it would be far from behaving like a respectable child at a select seminary to say that it had never occurred to you that you COULD love your father, that you would do anything desperate to avoid being left alone in his society for ten minutes. She was, indeed, greatly embarrassed.

" I - I scarcely ever see him, " she stammered. " He is always in the library - reading things. "

" I love mine more than all the world ten times over, " Sara said. " That is what my pain is. He has gone away. "

She put her head quietly down on her little, huddled - up knees, and sat very still for a few minutes.

" She's going to cry out loud, " thought Ermengarde, fearfully.

But she did not. Her short, black locks tumbled about her ears, and she sat still. Then she spoke without lifting her head.

" I promised him I would bear it, " she said. " And I will. You have to bear things. Think what soldiers bear! Papa is a soldier. If there was a war he would have to bear marching and thirstiness and, perhaps, deep wounds. And he would never say a word - not one word. "

Ermengarde could only gaze at her, but she felt that she was beginning to adore her. She was so wonderful and different from anyone else.

Presently, she lifted her face and shook back her black locks, with a queer little smile.

" If I go on talking and talking, " she said, " and telling you things about pretending, I shall bear it better. You don' t forget, but you bear it better. "

Ermengarde did not know why a lump came into her throat and her eyes felt as if tears were in them.

" Lavinia and Jessie are' best friends, ' " she said rather huskily. " I wish we could be' best friends. ' Would you have me for yours? You' re clever, and I' m the stupidest child in the school, but I - oh, I do so like you! "

" I' m glad of that, " said Sara. " It makes you thankful when you are liked. Yes. We will be friends. And I' ll tell you what " - a sudden gleam lighting her face - " I can help you with your French lessons. "





CHAPTER Ⅳ　LOTTIE


IF Sara had been a different kind of child, the life she led at Miss Minchin's Select Seminary for the next few years would not have been at all good for her. She was treated more as if she were a distinguished guest at the establishment than as if she were a mere little girl. If she had been a self - opinionated, domineering child, she might have become disagreeable enough to be unbearable through being so much indulged and flattered. If she had been an indolent child, she would have learned nothing. Privately Miss Minchin disliked her, but she was far too worldly a woman to do or say anything which might make such a desirable pupil wish to leave her school. She knew quite well that if Sara wrote to her papa to tell him she was uncomfortable or unhappy, Captain Crewe would remove her at once. Miss Minchin's opinion was that if a child were continually praised and never forbidden to do what she liked, she would be sure to be fond of the place where she was so treated. Accordingly, Sara was praised for her quickness at her lessons, for her good manners, for her amiability to her fellow pupils, for her generosity if she gave sixpence to a beggar out of her full little purse; the simplest thing she did was treated as if it were a virtue, and if she had not had a disposition and a clever little brain, she might have been a very self - satisfied young person. But the clever little brain told her a great many sensible and true things about herself and her circumstances, and now and then she talked these things over to Ermengarde as time went on.

" Things happen to people by accident, " she used to say. " A lot of nice accidents have happened to me. It just HAPPENED that I always liked lessons and books, and could remember things when I learned them. It just happened that I was born with a father who was beautiful and nice and clever, and could give me everything I liked. Perhaps I have not really a good temper at all, but if you have everything you want and everyone is kind to you, how can you help but be good - tempered? I don' t know " - looking quite serious - " How I shall ever find out whether I am really a nice child or a horrid one. Perhaps I' m a HIDEOUS child, and no one will ever know, just because I never have any trials. "

" Lavinia has no trials, " said Ermengarde, stolidly, " and she is horrid enough. "

Sara rubbed the end of her little nose reflectively, as she thought the matter over.

" Well, " she said at last, " Perhaps - perhaps that is because Lavinia is GROWING. "

This was the result of a charitable recollection of having heard Miss Amelia say that Lavinia was growing so fast that she believed it affected her health and temper.

Lavinia, in fact, was spiteful. She was inordinately jealous of Sara. Until the new pupil's arrival, she had felt herself the leader in the school. She had led because she was capable of making herself extremely disagreeable if the others did not follow her. She domineered over the little children, and assumed grand airs with those big enough to be her companions. She was rather pretty, and had been the best - dressed pupil in the procession when the Select Seminary walked out two by two, until Sara's velvet coats and sable muffs appeared, combined with drooping ostrich feathers, and were led by Miss Minchin at the head of the line. This, at the beginning, had been bitter enough; but as time went on it became apparent that Sara was a leader, too, and not because she could make herself disagreeable, but because she never did.

" There's one thing about Sara Crewe, " Jessie had enraged her " Best friend " by saying honestly, " She's never' grand' about herself the least bit, and you know she might be, Lavvie. I believe I couldn' t help being - just a little - if I had so many fine things and was made such a fuss over. It's disgusting, the way Miss Minchin shows her off when parents come. "

" ' Dear Sara must come into the drawing - room and talk to Mrs. Musgrave about India, ' " mimicked Lavinia, in her most highly flavored imitation of Miss Minchin. " ' Dear Sara must speak French to Lady Pitkin. Her accent is so perfect. 'she didn' t learn her French at the Seminary, at any rate. And there's nothing so clever in her knowing it. She says herself she didn' t learn it at all. She just picked it up, because she always heard her papa speak it. And, as to her papa, there is nothing so grand in being an Indian officer. "

" Well, " said Jessie, slowly, " He's killed tigers. He killed the one in the skin Sara has in her room. That's why she likes it so. She lies on it and strokes its head, and talks to it as if it was a cat. "

" She's always doing something silly, " snapped Lavinia. " My mamma says that way of hers of pretending things is silly. She says she will grow up eccentric. "

It was quite true that Sara was never " grand. " She was a friendly little soul, and shared her privileges and belongings with a free hand. The little ones, who were accustomed to being disdained and ordered out of the way by mature ladies aged ten and twelve, were never made to cry by this most envied of them all. She was a motherly young person, and when people fell down and scraped their knees, she ran and helped them up and patted them, or found in her pocket a bonbon or some other article of a soothing nature. She never pushed them out of her way or alluded to their years as a humiliation and a blot upon their small characters.

" If you are four you are four, " she said severely to Lavinia on an occasion of her having - it must be confessed - slapped Lottie and called her " a brat " ; " But you will be five next year, and six the year after that. And, " opening large, convicting eyes, " It only takes sixteen years to make you twenty. "

" Dear me! " said Lavinia; " How we can calculate! " In fact, it was not to be denied that sixteen and four made twenty - and twenty was an age the most daring were scarcely bold enough to dream of.

So the younger children adored Sara. More than once she had been known to have a tea - party, made up of these despised ones, in her own room. And Emily had been played with, and Emily's own tea - service used - the one with cups which held quite a lot of much - sweetened weak tea and had blue flowers on them. No one had seen such a very real doll's tea - set before. From that afternoon Sara was regarded as a goddess and a queen by the entire alphabet class.

Lottie Legh worshipped her to such an extent that if Sara had not been a motherly person, she would have found her tiresome. Lottie had been sent to school by a rather flighty young papa who could not imagine what else to do with her. Her young mother had died, and as the child had been treated like a favorite doll or a very spoiled pet monkey or lap dog ever since the first hour of her life, she was a very appalling little creature. When she wanted anything or did not want anything she wept and howled; and, as she always wanted the things she could not have, and did not want the things that were best for her, her shrill little voice was usually to be heard uplifted in wails in one part of the house or another.

Her strongest weapon was that in some mysterious way she had found out that a very small girl who had lost her mother was a person who ought to be pitied and made much of. She had probably heard some grown - up people talking her over in the early days, after her mother's death. So it became her habit to make great use of this knowledge.

The first time Sara took her in charge was one morning when, on passing a sitting - room, she heard both Miss Minchin and Miss Amelia trying to suppress the angry wails of some child who, evidently, refused to be silenced. She refused so strenuously indeed that Miss Minchin was obliged to almost shout - in a stately and severe manner - to make herself heard.

" What is she crying for? " she almost yelled.

" Oh - oh - oh! " Sara heard; " I haven' t got any mam - ma - a! "

" Oh, Lottie! " screamed Miss Amelia. " Do stop, darling! Don' t cry! Please don' t! "

" Oh! Oh! Oh! " Lottie howled tempestuously. " Haven' t - got - any - mam - ma - a! "

" She ought to be whipped, " Miss Minchin proclaimed. " You SHALL be whipped, you naughty child! "

Lottie wailed more loudly than ever. Miss Amelia began to cry. Miss Minchin's voice rose until it almost thundered, then suddenly she sprang up from her chair in impotent indignation and flounced out of the room, leaving Miss Amelia to arrange the matter.

Sara had paused in the hall, wondering if she ought to go into the room, because she had recently begun a friendly acquaintance with Lottie and might be able to quiet her. When Miss Minchin came out and saw her, she looked rather annoyed. She realized that her voice, as heard from inside the room, could not have sounded either dignified or amiable.

" Oh, Sara! " she exclaimed, endeavoring to produce a suitable smile.

" I stopped, " explained Sara, " Because I knew it was Lottie - and I thought, perhaps - just perhaps, I could make her be quiet. May I try, Miss Minchin? "

" If you can. You are a clever child, " answered Miss Minchin, drawing in her mouth sharply. Then, seeing that Sara looked slightly chilled by her asperity, she changed her manner. " But you are clever in everything, " she said in her approving way. " I dare say you can manage her. Go in. " And she left her.

When Sara entered the room, Lottie was lying upon the floor, screaming and kicking her small fat legs violently, and Miss Amelia was bending over her in consternation and despair, looking quite red and damp with heat. Lottie had always found, when in her own nursery at home, that kicking and screaming would always be quieted by any means she insisted on. Poor plump Miss Amelia was trying first one method, and then another.

" Poor darling! " she said one moment; " I know you haven' t any mamma, poor - " Then in quite another tone: " If you don' t stop, Lottie, I will shake you. Poor little angel! There - there! You wicked, bad, detestable child, I will smack you! I will! "

Sara went to them quietly. She did not know at all what she was going to do, but she had a vague inward conviction that it would be better not to say such different kinds of things quite so helplessly and excitedly.

" Miss Amelia, " she said in a low voice, " Miss Minchin says I may try to make her stop - may I? "

Miss Amelia turned and looked at her hopelessly. " Oh, DO you think you can? " she gasped.

" I don' t know whether I CAN, " answered Sara, still in her half - whisper; " But I will try. "

Miss Amelia stumbled up from her knees with a heavy sigh, and Lottie's fat little legs kicked as hard as ever.

" If you will steal out of the room, " said Sara, " I will stay with her. "

" Oh, Sara! " almost whimpered Miss Amelia. " We never had such a dreadful child before. I don' t believe we can keep her. "

But she crept out of the room, and was very much relieved to find an excuse for doing it.

Sara stood by the howling, furious child for a few moments, and looked down at her without saying anything. Then she sat down flat on the floor beside her and waited. Except for Lottie's angry screams, the room was quite quiet. This was a new state of affairs for little Miss Legh, who was accustomed, when she screamed, to hear other people protest and implore and command and coax by turns. To lie and kick and shriek, and find the only person near you not seeming to mind in the least, attracted her attention. She opened her tight - shut streaming eyes to see who this person was. And it was only another little girl. But it was the one who owned Emily and all the nice things. And she was looking at her steadily and as if she was merely thinking. Having paused for a few seconds to find this out, Lottie thought she must begin again, but the quiet of the room and of Sara's odd, interested face made her first howl rather half - hearted.

" I - haven' t - any - ma - ma - ma - a! " she announced; but her voice was not so strong.

Sara looked at her still more steadily, but with a sort of understanding in her eyes.

" Neither have I, " she said.

This was so unexpected that it was astounding. Lottie actually dropped her legs, gave a wriggle, and lay and stared. A new idea will stop a crying child when nothing else will. Also it was true that while Lottie disliked Miss Minchin, who was cross, and Miss Amelia, who was foolishly indulgent, she rather liked Sara, little as she knew her. She did not want to give up her grievance, but her thoughts were distracted from it, so she wriggled again, and, after a sulky sob, said:

" Where is she? "

Sara paused a moment. Because she had been told that her mamma was in heaven, she had thought a great deal about the matter, and her thoughts had not been quite like those of other people.

" She went to heaven, " she said. " But I am sure she comes out sometimes to see me - though I don' t see her. So does yours. Perhaps they can both see us now. Perhaps they are both in this room. "

Lottie sat bolt upright, and looked about her. She was a pretty, little, curly - headed creature, and her round eyes were like wet forget - me - nots. If her mamma had seen her during the last half - hour, she might not have thought her the kind of child who ought to be related to an angel.

Sara went on talking. Perhaps some people might think that what she said was rather like a fairy story, but it was all so real to her own imagination that Lottie began to listen in spite of herself. She had been told that her mamma had wings and a crown, and she had been shown pictures of ladies in beautiful white night - gowns, who were said to be angels. But Sara seemed to be telling a real story about a lovely country where real people were.

" There are fields and fields of flowers, " she said, forgetting herself, as usual, when she began, and talking rather as if she were in a dream - " fields and fields of lilies - and when the soft wind blows over them it wafts the scent of them into the air - and everybody always breathes it, because the soft wind is always blowing. And little children run about in the lily - fields and gather armsful of them, and laugh and make little wreaths. And the streets are shining. And no one is ever tired, however far they walk. They can float anywhere they like. And there are walls made of pearl and gold all round the city, but they are low enough for the people to go and lean on them, and look down on to the earth and smile, and send beautiful messages. "

Whatsoever story she had begun to tell, Lottie would, no doubt, have stopped crying, and been fascinated into listening; but there was no denying that this story was prettier than most others. She dragged herself close to Sara, and drank in every word until the end came - far too soon. When it did come, she was so sorry that she put up her lip ominously.

" I want to go there, " she cried. " I? - ? haven' t any mamma in this school. "

Sara saw the danger signal, and came out of her dream. She took hold of the chubby hand and pulled her close to her side with a coaxing little laugh.

" I will be your mamma, " she said. " We will play that you are my little girl. And Emily shall be your sister. "

Lottie's dimples all began to show themselves.

" Shall she? " she said.

" Yes, " answered Sara, jumping to her feet. " Let us go and tell her. And then I will wash your face and brush your hair. "

To which Lottie agreed quite cheerfully, and trotted out of the room and upstairs with her, without seeming even to remember that the whole of the last hour's tragedy had been caused by the fact that she had refused to be washed and brushed for lunch and Miss Minchin had been called in to use her majestic authority.

And from that time Sara was an adopted mother.





CHAPTER Ⅴ　BECKY


OF course the greatest power Sara possessed and the one which gained her even more followers than her luxuries and the fact that she was " the show pupil, " the power that Lavinia and certain other girls were most envious of, and at the same time most fascinated by in spite of themselves, was her power of telling stories and of making everything she talked about seem like a story, whether it was one or not.

Anyone who has been at school with a teller of stories knows what the wonder means - how he or she is followed about and besought in a whisper to relate romances; how groups gather round and hang on the outskirts of the favored party in the hope of being allowed to join in and listen. Sara not only could tell stories, but she adored telling them. When she sat or stood in the midst of a circle and began to invent wonderful things, her green eyes grew big and shining, her cheeks flushed, and, without knowing that she was doing it, she began to act and made what she told lovely or alarming by the raising or dropping of her voice, the bend and sway of her slim body, and the dramatic movement of her hands. She forgot that she was talking to listening children; she saw and lived with the fairy folk, or the kings and queens and beautiful ladies, whose adventures she was narrating. Sometimes when she had finished her story, she was quite out of breath with excitement, and would lay her hand on her thin, little, quick - rising chest, and half laugh as if at herself.

" When I am telling it, " she would say, " It doesn' t seem as if it was only made up. It seems more real than you are - more real than the schoolroom. I feel as if I were all the people in the story - one after the other. It is queer. "

She had been at Miss Minchin's school about two years when, one foggy winter's afternoon, as she was getting out of her carriage, comfortably wrapped up in her warmest velvets and furs and looking very much grander than she knew, she caught sight, as she crossed the pavement, of a dingy little figure standing on the area steps, and stretching its neck so that its wide - open eyes might peer at her through the railings. Something in the eagerness and timidity of the smudgy face made her look at it, and when she looked she smiled because it was her way to smile at people.

But the owner of the smudgy face and the wide - open eyes evidently was afraid that she ought not to have been caught looking at pupils of importance. She dodged out of sight like a Jack - in - the - box and scurried back into the kitchen, disappearing so suddenly that if she had not been such a poor, little forlorn thing, Sara would have laughed in spite of herself. That very evening, as Sara was sitting in the midst of a group of listeners in a corner of the schoolroom telling one of her stories, the very same figure timidly entered the room, carrying a coalbox much too heavy for her, and knelt down upon the hearth - rug to replenish the fire and sweep up the ashes.

She was cleaner than she had been when she peeped through the area railings, but she looked just as frightened. She was evidently afraid to look at the children or seem to be listening. She put on pieces of coal cautiously with her fingers so that she might make no disturbing noise, and she swept about the fire - irons very softly. But Sara saw in two minutes that she was deeply interested in what was going on, and that she was doing her work slowly in the hope of catching a word here and there. And realizing this, she raised her voice and spoke more clearly.

" The Mermaids swam softly about in the crystal - green water, and dragged after them a fishing - net woven of deep - sea pearls, " she said. " The Princess sat on the white rock and watched them. "

It was a wonderful story about a princess who was loved by a Prince Merman, and went to live with him in shining caves under the sea.

The small drudge before the grate swept the hearth once and then swept it again. Having done it twice, she did it three times; and, as she was doing it the third time, the sound of the story so lured her to listen that she fell under the spell and actually forgot that she had no right to listen at all, and also forgot everything else. She sat down upon her heels as she knelt on the hearth - rug, and the brush hung idly in her fingers. The voice of the story - teller went on and drew her with it into winding grottos under the sea, glowing with soft, clear blue light, and paved with pure golden sands. Strange sea flowers and grasses waved about her, and far away faint singing and music echoed.

The hearth - brush fell from the work - roughened hand, and Lavinia Herbert looked round.

" That girl has been listening, " she said.

The culprit snatched up her brush, and scrambled to her feet. She caught at the coalbox and simply scuttled out of the room like a frightened rabbit.

Sara felt rather hot - tempered.

" I knew she was listening, " she said. " Why shouldn' t she? "

Lavinia tossed her head with great elegance.

" Well, " she remarked, " I do not know whether your mamma would like you to tell stories to servant girls, but I know MY mamma wouldn' t like ME to do it. "

" My mamma! " said Sara, looking odd. " I don' t believe she would mind in the least. She knows that stories belong to everybody. "

" I thought, " retorted Lavinia, in severe recollection, " that your mamma was dead. How can she know things? "

" Do you think she DOESN' T know things? " said Sara, in her stern little voice. Sometimes she had a rather stern little voice.

" Sara's mamma knows everything, " piped in Lottie. " So does my mamma - ' cept Sara is my mamma at Miss Minchin's - my other one knows everything. The streets are shining, and there are fields and fields of lilies, and everybody gathers them. Sara tells me when she puts me to bed. "

" You wicked thing, " said Lavinia, turning on Sara; " making fairy stories about heaven. "

" There are much more splendid stories in Revelation, " returned Sara. " Just look and see! How do you know mine are fairy stories? But I can tell you " - with a fine bit of unheavenly temper - " You will never find out whether they are or not if you' re not kinder to people than you are now. Come along, Lottie. " And she marched out of the room, rather hoping that she might see the little servant again somewhere, but she found no trace of her when she got into the hall.

" Who is that little girl who makes the fires? " she asked Mariette that night.

Mariette broke forth into a flow of description.

Ah, indeed. Mademoiselle Sara might well ask. She was a forlorn little thing who had just taken the place of scullery - maid - though, as to being scullery - maid, she was everything else besides. She blacked boots and grates, and carried heavy coal - scuttles up and down stairs, and scrubbed floors and cleaned windows, and was ordered about by everybody. She was fourteen years old, but was so stunted in growth that she looked about twelve. In truth, Mariette was sorry for her. She was so timid that if one chanced to speak to her it appeared as if her poor, frightened eyes would jump out of her head.

" What is her name? " asked Sara, who had sat by the table, with her chin on her hands, as she listened absorbedly to the recital.

Her name was Becky. Mariette heard everyone belowstairs calling, " Becky, do this, " and " Becky, do that, " every five minutes in the day.

Sara sat and looked into the fire, reflecting on Becky for some time after Mariette left her. She made up a story of which Becky was the ill - used heroine. She thought she looked as if she had never had quite enough to eat. Her very eyes were hungry. She hoped she should see her again, but though she caught sight of her carrying things up or down stairs on several occasions, she always seemed in such a hurry and so afraid of being seen that it was impossible to speak to her.

But a few weeks later, on another foggy afternoon, when she entered her sitting - room she found herself confronting a rather pathetic picture. In her own special and pet easy - chair before the bright fire, Becky - with a coal smudge on her nose and several on her apron, with her poor little cap hanging half off her head, and an empty coalbox on the floor near her - sat fast asleep, tired out beyond even the endurance of her hard - working young body. She had been sent up to put the bedrooms in order for the evening. There were a great many of them, and she had been running about all day. Sara's rooms she had saved until the last. They were not like the other rooms, which were plain and bare. Ordinary pupils were expected to be satisfied with mere necessaries, Sara's comfortable sitting - room seemed a bower of luxury to the scullery - maid, though it was, in fact, merely a nice, bright little room. But there were pictures and books in it, and curious things from India; there was a sofa and the low, soft chair; Emily sat in a chair of her own, with the air of a presiding goddess, and there was always a glowing fire and a polished grate. Becky saved it until the end of her afternoon's work, because it rested her to go into it, and she always hoped to snatch a few minutes to sit down in the soft chair and look about her, and think about the wonderful good fortune of the child who owned such surroundings and who went out on the cold days in beautiful hats and coats one tried to catch a glimpse of through the area railing.

On this afternoon, when she had sat down, the sensation of relief to her short, aching legs had been so wonderful and delightful that it had seemed to soothe her whole body, and the glow of warmth and comfort from the fire had crept over her like a spell, until, as she looked at the red coals, a tired, slow smile stole over her smudged face, her head nodded forward without her being aware of it, her eyes drooped, and she fell fast asleep. She had really been only about ten minutes in the room when Sara entered, but she was in as deep a sleep as if she had been, like the Sleeping Beauty, slumbering for a hundred years. But she did not look - poor Becky! - like a Sleeping Beauty at all. She looked only like an ugly, stunted, worn - out little scullery drudge.

Sara seemed as much unlike her as if she were a creature from another world.

On this particular afternoon she had been taking her dancing - lesson, and the afternoon on which the dancing master appeared was rather a grand occasion at the seminary, though it occurred every week. The pupils were attired in their prettiest frocks, and as Sara danced particularly well, she was very much brought forward, and Mariette was requested to make her as diaphanous and fine as possible.

Today a frock the color of a rose had been put on her, and Mariette had bought some real buds and made her a wreath to wear on her black locks. She had been learning a new, delightful dance in which she had been skimming and flying about the room, like a large rose - colored butterfly, and the enjoyment and exercise had brought a brilliant, happy glow into her face.

When she entered the room, she floated in with a few of the butterfly steps - and there sat Becky, nodding her cap sideways off her head.

" Oh! " cried Sara, softly, when she saw her. " That poor thing! "

It did not occur to her to feel cross at finding her pet chair occupied by the small, dingy figure. To tell the truth, she was quite glad to find it there. When the ill - used heroine of her story wakened, she could talk to her. She crept toward her quietly, and stood looking at her. Becky gave a little snore.

" I wish she' d waken herself, " Sara said. " I don' t like to waken her. But Miss Minchin would be cross if she found out. I' ll just wait a few minutes. "

She took a seat on the edge of the table, and sat swinging her slim, rose - colored legs, and wondering what it would be best to do. Miss Amelia might come in at any moment, and if she did, Becky would be sure to be scolded.

" But she is so tired, " she thought. " She is so tired! "

A piece of flaming coal ended her perplexity for her that very moment. It broke off from a large lump and fell on to the fender. Becky started, and opened her eyes with a frightened gasp. She did not know she had fallen asleep. She had only sat down for one moment and felt the beautiful glow - and here she found herself staring in wild alarm at the wonderful pupil, who sat perched quite near her, like a rose - colored fairy, with interested eyes.

She sprang up and clutched at her cap. She felt it dangling over her ear, and tried wildly to put it straight. Oh, she had got herself into trouble now with a vengeance! To have impudently fallen asleep on such a young lady's chair! She would be turned out of doors without wages.

She made a sound like a big breathless sob.

" Oh, miss! Oh, miss! " she stuttered. " I arst yer pardon, miss! Oh, I do, miss! "

Sara jumped down, and came quite close to her.

" Don' t be frightened, " she said, quite as if she had been speaking to a little girl like herself. " It doesn' t matter the least bit. "

" I didn' t go to do it, miss, " protested Becky. " It was the warm fire - an' me bein'so tired. It - it WASN' T impertience! "

Sara broke into a friendly little laugh, and put her hand on her shoulder.

" You were tired, " she said; " You could not help it. You are not really awake yet. "

How poor Becky stared at her! In fact, she had never heard such a nice, friendly sound in anyone's voice before. She was used to being ordered about and scolded, and having her ears boxed. And this one - in her rose - colored dancing afternoon splendor - was looking at her as if she were not a culprit at all - as if she had a right to be tired - even to fall asleep! The touch of the soft, slim little paw on her shoulder was the most amazing thing she had ever known.

" Ain' t - ain' t yer angry, miss? " she gasped. " Ain' t yer goin' to tell the missus? "

" No, " cried out Sara. " Of course I' m not. "

The woful fright in the coal - smutted face made her suddenly so sorry that she could scarcely bear it. One of her queer thoughts rushed into her mind. She put her hand against Becky's cheek.

" Why, " she said, " We are just the same - I am only a little girl like you. It's just an accident that I am not you, and you are not me! "

Becky did not understand in the least. Her mind could not grasp such amazing thoughts, and " an accident " meant to her a calamity in which some one was run over or fell off a ladder and was carried to " the' orspital. "

" A' accident, miss, " she fluttered respectfully. " Is it? "

" Yes, " Sara answered, and she looked at her dreamily for a moment. But the next she spoke in a different tone. She realized that Becky did not know what she meant.

" Have you done your work? " she asked. " Dare you stay here a few minutes? "

Becky lost her breath again.

" Here, miss? Me? "

Sara ran to the door, opened it, and looked out and listened.

" No one is anywhere about, " she explained. " If your bedrooms are finished, perhaps you might stay a tiny while. I thought - perhaps - you might like a piece of cake. "

The next ten minutes seemed to Becky like a sort of delirium. Sara opened a cupboard, and gave her a thick slice of cake. She seemed to rejoice when it was devoured in hungry bites. She talked and asked questions, and laughed until Becky's fears actually began to calm themselves, and she once or twice gathered boldness enough to ask a question or so herself, daring as she felt it to be.

" Is that - " she ventured, looking longingly at the rose - colored frock. And she asked it almost in a whisper. " Is that there your best? "

" It is one of my dancing - frocks, " answered Sara. " I like it, don' t you? "

For a few seconds Becky was almost speechless with admiration. Then she said in an awed voice:

" Onct I see a princess. I was standin' in the street with the crowd outside Covin' Garden, watchin' the swells go inter the operer. An' there was one everyone stared at most. They ses to each other, ' That's the princess. 'she was a growed - up young lady, but she was pink all over - gownd an' cloak, an' flowers an' all. I called her to mind the minnit I see you, sittin' there on the table, miss. You looked like her. "

" I' ve often thought, " said Sara, in her reflecting voice, " that I should like to be a princess; I wonder what it feels like. I believe I will begin pretending I am one. "

Becky stared at her admiringly, and, as before, did not understand her in the least. She watched her with a sort of adoration. Very soon Sara left her reflections and turned to her with a new question.

" Becky, " she said, " weren' t you listening to that story? "

" Yes, miss, " confessed Becky, a little alarmed again. " I knowed I hadn' t orter, but it was that beautiful I - I couldn' t help it. "

" I liked you to listen to it, " said Sara. " If you tell stories, you like nothing so much as to tell them to people who want to listen. I don' t know why it is. Would you like to hear the rest? "

Becky lost her breath again.

" Me hear it? " she cried. " Like as if I was a pupil, miss! All about the Prince - and the little white Mer - babies swimming about laughing - with stars in their hair? "

Sara nodded.

" You haven' t time to hear it now, I' m afraid, " she said; " But if you will tell me just what time you come to do my rooms, I will try to be here and tell you a bit of it every day until it is finished. It's a lovely long one - and I' m always putting new bits to it. "

" Then, " breathed Becky, devoutly, " I wouldn' t mind HOW heavy the coalboxes was - or WHAT the cook done to me, if - if I might have that to think of. "

" You may, " said Sara. " I' ll tell it ALL to you. "

When Becky went downstairs, she was not the same Becky who had staggered up, loaded down by the weight of the coal - scuttle. She had an extra piece of cake in her pocket, and she had been fed and warmed, but not only by cake and fire. Something else had warmed and fed her, and the something else was Sara.

When she was gone Sara sat on her favorite perch on the end of her table. Her feet were on a chair, her elbows on her knees, and her chin in her hands.

" If I WAS a princess - a REAL princess, " she murmured, " I could scatter largess to the populace. But even if I am only a pretend princess, I can invent little things to do for people. Things like this. She was just as happy as if it was largess. I' ll pretend that to do things people like is scattering largess. I' ve scattered largess. "





CHAPTER Ⅵ　THE DIAMOND - MINES


NOT very long after this a very exciting thing happened. Not only Sara, but the entire school, found it exciting, and made it the chief subject of conversation for weeks after it occurred. In one of his letters Captain Crewe told a most interesting story. A friend who had been at school with him when he was a boy had unexpectedly come to see him in India. He was the owner of a large tract of land upon which diamonds had been found, and he was engaged in developing the mines. If all went as was confidently expected, he would become possessed of such wealth as it made one dizzy to think of; and because he was fond of the friend of his school - days, he had given him an opportunity to share in this enormous fortune by becoming a partner in his scheme. This, at least, was what Sara gathered from his letters. It is true that any other business scheme, however magnificent, would have had but small attraction for her or for the schoolroom; but " Diamond - mines " sounded so like the " Arabian Nights " that no one could be indifferent. Sara thought them enchanting, and painted pictures, for Ermengarde and Lottie, of labyrinthine passages in the bowels of the earth, where sparkling stones studded the walls and roofs and ceilings, and strange, dark men dug them out with heavy picks. Ermengarde delighted in the story, and Lottie insisted on its being retold to her every evening. Lavinia was very spiteful about it, and told Jessie that she didn' t believe such things as diamond - mines existed.

" My mamma has a diamond ring which cost forty pounds, " she said. " And it is not a big one, either. If there were mines full of diamonds, people would be so rich it would be ridiculous. "

" Perhaps Sara will be so rich that she will be ridiculous, " giggled Jessie.

" She's ridiculous without being rich, " Lavinia sniffed.

" I believe you hate her, " said Jessie.

" No, I don' t, " snapped Lavinia. " But I don' t believe in mines full of diamonds. "

" Well, people have to get them from somewhere, " said Jessie. " Lavinia, " - with a new giggle - " What do you think Gertrude says? "

" I don' t know, I' m sure; and I don' t care if it's something more about that everlasting Sara. "

" Well, it is. One of her' pretends' is that she is a princess. She plays it all the time - even in school. She says it makes her learn her lessons better. She wants Ermengarde to be one, too, but Ermengarde says she is too fat. "

" She is too fat, " said Lavinia. " And Sara is too thin. "

Naturally, Jessie giggled again.

" She says it has nothing to do with what you look like, or what you have. It has only to do with what you THINK of, and what you DO. "

" I suppose she thinks she could be a princess if she was a beggar, " said Lavinia. " Let us begin to call her Your Royal Highness. "

Lessons for the day were over, and they were sitting before the schoolroom fire, enjoying the time they liked best. It was the time when Miss Minchin and Miss Amelia were taking their tea in the sitting - room sacred to themselves. At this hour a great deal of talking was done, and a great many secrets changed hands, particularly if the younger pupils behaved themselves well, and did not squabble or run about noisily, which it must be confessed they usually did. When they made an uproar the older girls usually interfered with scoldings and shakes. They were expected to keep order, and there was danger that if they did not. Miss Minchin or Miss Amelia would appear and put an end to festivities. Even as Lavinia spoke the door opened and Sara entered with Lottie, whose habit was to trot everywhere after her like a little dog.

" There she is, with that horrid child! " exclaimed Lavinia, in a whisper. " If she's so fond of her, why doesn' t she keep her in her own room? She will begin howling about something in five minutes. "

It happened that Lottie had been seized with a sudden desire to play in the schoolroom, and had begged her adopted parent to come with her. She joined a group of little ones who were playing in a corner. Sara curled herself up in the window - seat, opened a book, and began to read. It was a book about the French Revolution, and she was soon lost in a harrowing picture of the prisoners in the Bastille - men who had spent so many years in dungeons that when they were dragged out by those who rescued them, their long, gray hair and beards almost hid their faces, and they had forgotten that an outside world existed at all, and were like beings in a dream.

She was so far away from the schoolroom that it was not agreeable to be dragged back suddenly by a howl from Lottie. Never did she find anything so difficult as to keep herself from losing her temper when she was suddenly disturbed while absorbed in a book. People who are fond of books know the feeling of irritation which sweeps over them at such a moment. The temptation to be unreasonable and snappish is one not easy to manage.

" It makes me feel as if someone had hit me, " Sara had told Ermengarde once in confidence. " And as if I want to hit back. I have to remember things quickly to keep from saying something ill - tempered. "

She had to remember things quickly when she laid her book on the window - seat and jumped down from her comfortable corner.

Lottie had been sliding across the schoolroom floor, and, having first irritated Lavinia and Jessie by making a noise, had ended by falling down and hurting her fat knee. She was screaming and dancing up and down in the midst of a group of friends and enemies, who were alternately coaxing and scolding her.

" Stop this minute, you cry - baby! Stop this minute! " Lavinia commanded.

" I' m not a cry - baby - I' m not! " wailed Lottie. " Sara, Sa - ra! "

" If she doesn' t stop. Miss Minchin will hear her, " cried Jessie. " Lottie darling, I' ll give you a penny! "

" I don' t want your penny, " sobbed Lottie; and she looked down at the fat knee, and, seeing a drop of blood on it, burst forth again.

Sara flew across the room and, kneeling down, put her arms round her.

" Now, Lottie, " she said. " Now, Lottie, you PROMISED Sara. "

" She said I was a cry - baby, " wept Lottie.

Sara patted her, but spoke in the steady voice Lottie knew.

" But if you cry, you will be one, Lottie pet. You PROMISED. "

Lottie remembered that she had promised, but she preferred to lift up her voice.

" I haven' t any mamma, " she proclaimed. " I haven' t - a bit - of mamma. "

" Yes, you have, " said Sara, cheerfully. " Have you forgotten? Don' t you know that Sara is your mamma? Don' t you want Sara for your mamma? "

Lottie cuddled up to her with a consoled sniff.

" Come and sit in the window - seat with me, " Sara went on, " And I' ll whisper a story to you. "

" Will you? " whimpered Lottie. " Will you - tell me - about the diamond - mines? "

" The diamond - mines? " broke out Lavinia. " Nasty, little spoiled thing, I should like to SLAP her! "

Sara got up quickly on her feet. It must be remembered that she had been very deeply absorbed in the book about the Bastille, and she had had to recall several things rapidly when she realized that she must go and take care of her adopted child. She was not an angel, and she was not fond of Lavinia.

" Well, " she said, with some fire, " I should like to slap YOU - but I don' t want to slap you! " restraining herself. " At least I both want to slap you - and I should LIKE to slap you - but I WON' T slap you. We are not little gutter children. We are both old enough to know better. "

Here was Lavinia's opportunity.

" Ah, yes, your royal highness, " she said. " We are princesses, I believe. At least one of us is. The school ought to be very fashionable now Miss Minchin has a princess for a pupil. "

Sara started toward her. She looked as if she were going to box her ears. Perhaps she was. Her trick of pretending things was the joy of her life. She never spoke of it to girls she was not fond of. Her new " Pretend " about being a princess was very near to her heart, and she was shy and sensitive about it. She had meant it to be rather a secret, and here was Lavinia deriding it before nearly all the school. She felt the blood rush up into her face and tingle in her ears. She only just saved herself. If you were a princess, you did not fly into rages. Her hand dropped, and she stood quite still a moment. When she spoke it was in a quiet, steady voice; she held her head up, and everybody listened to her.

" It's true, " she said. " Sometimes I do pretend I am a princess. I pretend I am a princess, so that I can try and behave like one. "

Lavinia could not think of exactly the right thing to say. Several times she had found that she could not think of a satisfactory reply when she was dealing with Sara. The reason of this was that, somehow, the rest always seemed to be vaguely in sympathy with her opponent. She saw now that they were pricking up their ears interestedly. The truth was, they liked princesses, and they all hoped they might hear something more definite about this one, and drew nearer Sara accordingly.

Lavinia could only invent one remark, and it fell rather flat.

" Dear me! " she said; " I hope, when you ascend the throne, you won' t forget us. "

" I won' t, " said Sara, and she did not utter another word, but stood quite still, and stared at her steadily as she saw her take Jessie's arm and turn away.

After this, the girls who were jealous of her used to speak of her as " Princess Sara " whenever they wished to be particularly disdainful, and those who were fond of her gave her the name among themselves as a term of affection. No one called her " Princess " instead of " Sara, " but her adorers were much pleased with the picturesqueness and grandeur of the title, and Miss Minchin, hearing of it, mentioned it more than once to visiting parents, feeling that it rather suggested a sort of royal boarding - school.

To Becky it seemed the most appropriate thing in the world. The acquaintance begun on the foggy afternoon when she had jumped up terrified from her sleep in the comfortable chair, had ripened and grown, though it must be confessed that Miss Minchin and Miss Amelia knew very little about it. They were aware that Sara was " kind " to the scullery - maid, but they knew nothing of certain delightful moments snatched perilously when, the upstairs rooms being set in order with lightning rapidity, Sara's sitting - room was reached, and the heavy coalbox set down with a sigh of joy. At such times stories were told by installments, things of a satisfying nature were either produced and eaten or hastily tucked into pockets to be disposed of at night, when Becky went upstairs to her attic to bed.

" But I has to eat' em careful, miss, " she said once; " ' cos if I leaves crumbs the rats come out to get' em. "

" Rats! " exclaimed Sara, in horror. " Are there rats there? "

" Lots of' em, miss, " Becky answered in quite a matter - of - fact manner. " There mostly is rats an' mice in attics. You gets used to the noise they makes scuttling about. I' ve got so I don' t mind' em s' long as they don' t run over my piller. "

" Ugh! " Said Sara.

" You gets used to anythin' after a bit, " said Becky. " You have to, miss, if you' re born a scullery - maid. I' d rather have rats than cockroaches. "

" So would I, " said Sara; " I suppose you might make friends with a rat in time, but I don' t believe I should like to make friends with a cockroach. "

Sometimes Becky did not dare to spend more than a few minutes in the bright, warm room, and when this was the case perhaps only a few words could be exchanged, and a small purchase slipped into the old - fashioned pocket Becky carried under her dress skirt, tied round her waist with a band of tape. The search for and discovery of satisfying things to eat which could be packed into small compass, added a new interest to Sara's existence. When she drove or walked out, she used to look into shop windows eagerly. The first time it occurred to her to bring home two or three little meat pies, she felt that she had hit upon a discovery. When she exhibited them, Becky's eyes quite sparkled.

" Oh, miss! " she murmured. " Them will be nice an' fillin' . It's fillin' ness that's best. Sponge - cake's a' evenly thing, but it melts away like - if you understand, miss. These' ll just STAY in yer stummick. "

" Well, " hesitated Sara, " I don' t think it would be good if they stayed always, but I do believe they will be satisfying. "

They were satisfying - and so were beef sandwiches, bought at a cook - shop - and so were rolls and Bologna sausage. In time, Becky began to lose her hungry, tired feeling, and the coalbox did not seem so unbearably heavy.

However heavy it was, and whatsoever the temper of the cook, and the hardness of the work heaped upon her shoulders, she had always the chance of the afternoon to look forward to - the chance that Miss Sara would be able to be in her sitting - room. In fact, the mere seeing of Miss Sara would have been enough without meat pies. If there was time only for a few words, they were always friendly, merry words that put heart into one; and if there was time for more, then there was an installment of a story to be told, or some other thing one remembered afterward and sometimes lay awake in one's bed in the attic to think over. Sara - who was only doing what she unconsciously liked better than anything else, Nature having made her for a giver - had not the least idea what she meant to poor Becky, and how wonderful a benefactor she seemed. If Nature has made you for a giver, your hands are born open, and so is your heart; and though there may be times when your hands are empty, your heart is always full, and you can give things out of that - warm things, kind things, sweet things - help and comfort and laughter - and sometimes gay, kind laughter is the best help of all.

Becky had scarcely known what laughter was through all her poor, little hard - driven life. Sara made her laugh, and laughed with her; and, though neither of them quite knew it, the laughter was as " fillin' " as the meat pies.

A few weeks before Sara's eleventh birthday a letter came to her from her father, which did not seem to be written in such boyish high spirits as usual. He was not very well, and was evidently overweighted by the business connected with the diamond - mines.

" You see, little Sara, " he wrote, " Your daddy is not a businessman at all, and figures and documents bother him. He does not really understand them, and all this seems so enormous. Perhaps, if I was not feverish I should not be awake, tossing about, one half of the night and spend the other half in troublesome dreams. If my little missus were here, I dare say she would give me some solemn, good advice. You would, wouldn' t you, little missus? "

One of his many jokes had been to call her his " little missus " because she had such an old - fashioned air. He had made wonderful preparations for her birthday. Among other things, a new doll had been ordered in Paris, and her wardrobe was to be, indeed, a marvel of splendid perfection. When she had replied to the letter asking her if the doll would be an acceptable present, Sara had been very quaint.

" I am getting very old, " she wrote; " You see, I shall never live to have another doll given me. This will be my last doll. There is something solemn about it. If I could write poetry, I am sure a poem about' A Last Doll' would be very nice. But I cannot write poetry. I have tried, and it made me laugh. It did not sound like Watts or Coleridge or Shakespeare at all. No one could ever take Emily's place, but I should respect the Last Doll very much; and I am sure the school would love it. They all like dolls, though some of the big ones - the almost fifteen ones - pretend they are too grown up. "

Captain Crewe had a splitting headache when he read this letter in his bungalow in India. The table before him was heaped with papers and letters which were alarming him and filling him with anxious dread, but he laughed as he had not laughed for weeks.

" Oh, " he said, " She's better fun every year she lives. God grant this business may right itself and leave me free to run home and see her. What wouldn' t I give to have her little arms round my neck this minute! What WOULDN' T I give! "

The birthday was to be celebrated by great festivities. The schoolroom was to be decorated, and there was to be a party. The boxes containing the presents were to be opened with great ceremony, and there was to be a glittering feast spread in Miss Minchin's sacred room. When the day arrived the whole house was in a whirl of excitement. How the morning passed nobody quite knew, because there seemed such preparations to be made. The schoolroom was being decked with garlands of holly; the desks had been moved away, and red covers had been put on the forms which were arrayed round the room against the wall.

When Sara went into her sitting - room in the morning, she found on the table a small, dumpy package, tied up in a piece of brown paper. She knew it was a present, and she thought she could guess whom it came from. She opened it quite tenderly. It was a square pincushion, made of not quite clean red flannel, and black pins had been stuck carefully into it to form the words, " Menny hapy returns. "

" Oh! " cried Sara, with a warm feeling in her heart. " What pains she has taken! I like it so, it - it makes me feel sorrowful. "

But the next moment she was mystified. On the under side of the pincushion was secured a card, bearing in neat letters the name " Miss Amelia Minchin. "

Sara turned it over and over.

" Miss Amelia! " she said to herself. " How CAN it be! "

And just at that very moment she heard the door being cautiously pushed open and saw Becky peeping round it. There was an affectionate, happy grin on her face, and she shuffled forward and stood nervously pulling at her fingers.

" Do yer like it, Miss Sara? " she said. " Do yer? "

" Like it? " cried Sara. " You darling Becky, you made it all yourself. "

Becky gave a hysteric but joyful sniff, and her eyes looked quite moist with delight.

" It ain' t nothin' but flannin, an' the flannin ain' t new; but I wanted to give yer somethin' an' I made it of nights. I knew yer could PRETEND it was satin with diamond pins in. I tried to when I was makin' it. The card, miss, " rather doubtfully; " ' t warn' t wrong of me to pick it up out o' the dust - bin, was it? Miss' Meliar had throwed it away. I hadn' t no card o' my own, an' I knowed it wouldn' t be a proper presink if I didn' t pin a card on - so I pinned Miss' Meliar's. "

Sara flew at her and hugged her. She could not have told herself or anyone else why there was a lump in her throat.

" Oh, Becky! " she cried out, with a queer little laugh. " I love you, Becky - I do, I do! "

" Oh, miss! " breathed Becky. " Thank yer, miss, kindly; It ain' t good enough for that. The - the flannin wasn' t new. "





CHAPTER Ⅶ　THE DIAMOND - MINES AGAIN


WHEN Sara entered the holly - hung schoolroom in the afternoon, she did so as the head of a sort of procession. Miss Minchin, in her grandest silk dress, led her by the hand. A man - servant followed, carrying the box containing the Last Doll, a housemaid carried a second box, and Becky brought up the rear, carrying a third and wearing a clean apron and a new cap. Sara would have much preferred to enter in the usual way, but Miss Minchin had sent for her, and, after an interview in her private sitting - room, had expressed her wishes.

" This is not an ordinary occasion, " she said. " I do not desire that it should be treated as one. "

So Sara was led grandly in and felt shy when, on her entry, the big girls stared at her and touched each other's elbows, and the little ones began to squirm joyously in their seats.

" Silence, young ladies! " said Miss Minchin, at the murmur which arose. " James, place the box on the table and remove the lid. Emma, put yours upon a chair. Becky! " suddenly and severely.

Becky had quite forgotten herself in her excitement, and was grinning at Lottie, who was wriggling with rapturous expectation. She almost dropped her box, the disapproving voice so startled her, and her frightened, bobbing curtsy of apology was so funny that Lavinia and Jessie tittered.

" It is not your place to look at the young ladies, " said Miss Minchin. " You forget yourself. Put your box down. "

Becky obeyed with alarmed haste and hastily backed toward the door.

" You may leave us, " Miss Minchin announced to the servants with a wave of her hand.

Becky stepped aside respectfully to allow the superior servants to pass out first. She could not help casting a longing glance at the box on the table. Something made of blue satin was peeping from between the folds of tissue - paper.

" If you please. Miss Minchin, " said Sara, suddenly, " mayn' t Becky stay? "

It was a bold thing to do. Miss Minchin was betrayed into something like a slight jump. Then she put her eyeglass up, and gazed at her show pupil disturbedly.

" Becky! " she exclaimed. " My dearest Sara! "

Sara advanced a step toward her.

" I want her because I know she will like to see the presents, " she explained. " She is a little girl, too, you know. "

Miss Minchin was scandalized. She glanced from one figure to the other.

" My dear Sara, " she said, " Becky is the scullery - maid. Scullery - maids - er - are not little girls. "

It really had not occurred to her to think of them in that light. Scullery - maids were machines who carried coal - scuttles and made fires.

" But Becky is, " said Sara. " And I know she would enjoy herself. Please let her stay - because it is my birthday. "

Miss Minchin replied with much dignity:

" As you ask it as a birthday favor - she may stay. Rebecca, thank Miss Sara for her great kindness. "

Becky had been backing into the corner, twisting the hem of her apron in delighted suspense. She came forward, bobbing courtesies, but between Sara's eyes and her own there passed a gleam of friendly understanding, while her words tumbled over each other.

" Oh, if you please, miss! I' m that grateful, miss! I did want to see the doll, miss, that I did. Thank you, miss. And thank you, ma' am, " - turning and making an alarmed bob to Miss Minchin - " for letting me take the liberty. "

Miss Minchin waved her hand again - this time it was in the direction of the corner near the door.

" Go and stand there, " she commanded. " Not too near the young ladies. "

Becky went to her place, grinning. She did not care where she was sent, so that she might have the luck of being inside the room, instead of being downstairs in the scullery, while these delights were going on. She did not even mind when Miss Minchin cleared her throat ominously and spoke again.

" Now, young ladies, I have a few words to say to you, " she announced.

" She's going to make a speech, " whispered one of the girls. " I wish it was over. "

Sara felt rather uncomfortable. As this was her party, it was probable that the speech was about her. It is not agreeable to stand in a schoolroom and have a speech made about you.

" You are aware, young ladies, " the speech began - for it was a speech - " That dear Sara is eleven years old today. "

" DEAR Sara! " murmured Lavinia.

" Several of you here have also been eleven years old, but Sara's birthdays are rather different from other little girls' birthdays. When she is older she will be heiress to a large fortune, which it will be her duty to spend in a meritorious manner. "

" The diamond - mines, " giggled Jessie, in a whisper. Sara did not hear her; but as she stood with her green - gray eyes fixed steadily on Miss Minchin, she felt herself growing rather hot. When Miss Minchin talked about money, she felt somehow that she always hated her - and, of course, it was disrespectful to hate grown - up people.

" When her dear papa, Captain Crewe, brought her from India and gave her into my care, " the speech proceeded, " he said to me, in a jesting way, ' I am afraid she will be very rich. Miss Minchin. ' My reply was, ' Her education at my seminary, Captain Crewe, shall be such as will adorn the largest fortune. 'sara has become my most accomplished pupil. Her French and her dancing are a credit to the seminary. Her manners - which have caused you to call her Princess Sara - are perfect. Her amiability she exhibits by giving you this afternoon's party. I hope you appreciate her generosity. I wish you to express your appreciation of it by saying aloud all together, ' Thank you, Sara! ' "

The entire schoolroom rose to its feet as it had done the morning Sara remembered so well.

" Thank you, Sara! " it said, and it must be confessed that Lottie jumped up and down. Sara looked rather shy for a moment. She made a curtsy - and it was a very nice one.

" Thank you, " she said, " for coming to my party. "

" Very pretty, indeed, Sara, " approved Miss Minchin. " That is what a real princess does when the populace applauds her. Lavinia, " - scathingly - " the sound you just made was extremely like a snort. If you are jealous of your fellow - pupil, I beg you will express your feelings in some more lady - like manner. Now I will leave you to enjoy yourselves. "

The instant she had swept out of the room the spell her presence always had upon them was broken. The door had scarcely closed before every seat was empty. The little girls jumped or tumbled out of theirs; the older ones wasted no time in deserting theirs. There was a rush toward the boxes. Sara had bent over one of them with a delighted face.

" These are books, I know, " she said.

The little children broke into a rueful murmur, and Ermengarde looked aghast.

" Does your papa send you books for a birthday present? " she exclaimed. " Why, he's as bad as mine. Don' t open them, Sara. "

" I like them, " Sara laughed, but she turned to the biggest box. When she took out the Last Doll it was so magnificent that the children uttered delighted groans of joy, and actually drew back to gaze at it in breathless rapture.

" She is almost as big as Lottie, " someone gasped.

Lottie clapped her hands and danced about, giggling.

" She's dressed for the theatre, " said Lavinia. " Her cloak is lined with ermine. "

" Oh! " cried Ermengarde, darting forward, " She has an opera - glass in her hand - a blue - and - gold one. "

" Here is her trunk, " said Sara. " Let us open it and look at her things. "

She sat down upon the floor and turned the key. The children crowded clamoring around her, as she lifted tray after tray and revealed their contents. Never had the schoolroom been in such an uproar. There were lace collars and silk stockings and handkerchiefs; there was a jewel - case containing a necklace and a tiara which looked quite as if they were made of real diamonds; there was a long sealskin and muff; there were ball dresses and walking dresses and visiting dresses; there were hats and tea - gowns and fans. Even Lavinia and Jessie forgot that they were too elderly to care for dolls, and uttered exclamations of delight and caught up things to look at them.

" Suppose, " Sara said, as she stood by the table, putting a large, black - velvet hat on the impassively smiling owner of all these splendors - " Suppose she understands human talk and feels proud of being admired. "

" You are always supposing things, " said Lavinia, and her air was very superior.

" I know I am, " answered Sara, undisturbedly. " I like it. There is nothing so nice as supposing. It's almost like being a fairy. If you suppose anything hard enough it seems as if it were real. "

" It's all very well to suppose things if you have everything, " said Lavinia. " Could you suppose and pretend if you were a beggar and lived in a garret? "

Sara stopped arranging the Last Doll's ostrich plumes, and looked thoughtful.

" I BELIEVE I could, " she said. " If one was a beggar, one would have to suppose and pretend all the time. But it mightn' t be easy. "

She often thought afterward how strange it was that just as she had finished saying this - just at that very moment - Miss Amelia came into the room.

" Sara, " she said, " Your papa's solicitor, Mr. Barrow, has called to see Miss Minchin, and, as she must talk to him alone and the refreshments are laid in her parlor, you had all better come and have your feast now, so that my sister can have her interview here in the schoolroom. "

Refreshments were not likely to be disdained at any hour, and many pairs of eyes gleamed. Miss Amelia arranged the procession into decorum, and then, with Sara at her side heading it, she led it away, leaving the Last Doll sitting upon a chair with the glories of her wardrobe scattered about her; dresses and coats hung upon chair backs, piles of lace - frilled petticoats lying upon their seats.

Becky, who was not expected to partake of refreshments, had the indiscretion to linger a moment to look at these beauties - it really was an indiscretion.

" Go back to your work, Becky, " Miss Amelia had said; but she had stopped to pick up reverently first a muff and then a coat, and while she stood looking at them adoringly, she heard Miss Minchin upon the threshold, and, being smitten with terror at the thought of being accused of taking liberties, she rashly darted under the table, which hid her by its table - cloth.

Miss Minchin came into the room, accompanied by a sharp - featured, dry little gentleman, who looked rather disturbed. Miss Minchin herself also looked rather disturbed, it must be admitted, and she gazed at the dry little gentleman with an irritated and puzzled expression.

She sat down with stiff dignity, and waved him to a chair.

" Pray, be seated, Mr. Barrow, " she said.

Mr. Barrow did not sit down at once. His attention seemed attracted by the Last Doll and the things which surrounded her. He settled his eye - glasses and looked at them in nervous disapproval. The Last Doll herself did not seem to mind this in the least. She merely sat upright and returned his gaze indifferently.

" A hundred pounds, " Mr. Barrow remarked succinctly. " All expensive material, and made at a Parisian modiste's. He spent money lavishly enough, that young man. "

Miss Minchin felt offended. This seemed to be a disparagement of her best patron and was a liberty.

Even solicitors had no right to take liberties.

" I beg your pardon, Mr. Barrow, " she said stiffly. " I do not understand. "

" Birthday presents, " said Mr. Barrow in the same critical manner, " to a child eleven years old! Mad extravagance, I call it. "

Miss Minchin drew herself up still more rigidly.

" Captain Crewe is a man of fortune, " she said. " The diamond - mines alone - "

Mr. Barrow wheeled round upon her.

" Diamond - mines! " he broke out. " There are none! Never were! "

Miss Minchin actually got up from her chair.

" What! " she cried. " What do you mean? "

" At any rate, " answered Mr. Barrow, quite snappishly, " It would have been much better if there never had been any. "

" Any diamond - mines? " ejaculated Miss Minchin, catching at the back of a chair and feeling as if a splendid dream was fading away from her.

" Diamond - mines spell ruin oftener than they spell wealth, " said Mr. Barrow. " When a man is in the hands of a very dear friend and is not a businessman himself, he had better steer clear of the dear friend's diamond - mines, or gold - mines, or any other kind of mines dear friends want his money to put into. The late Captain Crewe - "

Here Miss Minchin stopped him with a gasp.

" The late Captain Crewe! " she cried out; " The LATE! You don' t come to tell me that Captain Crewe is - "

" He's dead, ma' am, " Mr. Barrow answered with jerky brusqueness. " Died of jungle fever and business troubles combined. The jungle fever might not have killed him if he had not been driven mad by the business troubles, and the business troubles might not have put an end to him if the jungle fever had not assisted. Captain Crewe is dead! "

Miss Minchin dropped into her chair again. The words he had spoken filled her with alarm.

" What WERE his business troubles? " she said. " What WERE they? "

" Diamond - mines, " answered Mr. Barrow, " And dear friends - and ruin. "

Miss Minchin lost her breath.

" Ruin! " she gasped out.

" Lost every penny. That young man had too much money. The dear friend was mad on the subject of the diamond - mine. He put all his own money into it, and all Captain Crewe's. Then the dear friend ran away - Captain Crewe was already stricken with fever when the news came. The shock was too much for him. He died delirious, raving about his little girl - and didn' t leave a penny. "

Now Miss Minchin understood, and never had she received such a blow in her life. Her show pupil, her show patron, swept away from the Select Seminary at one blow. She felt as if she had been outraged and robbed, and that Captain Crewe and Sara and Mr. Barrow were equally to blame.

" Do you mean to tell me, " she cried out, " that he left NOTHING! That Sara will have no fortune! That the child is a beggar! That she is left on my hands a little pauper instead of an heiress? "

Mr. Barrow was a shrewd businessman, and felt it as well to make his own freedom from responsibility quite clear without any delay.

" She is certainly left a beggar, " he replied. " And she is certainly left on your hands, ma' am - as she hasn' t a relation in the world that we know of. "

Miss Minchin started forward. She looked as if she was going to open the door and rush out of the room to stop the festivities going on joyfully and rather noisily that moment over the refreshments.

" It is monstrous! " she said. " She's in my sitting - room at this moment, dressed in silk gauze and lace petticoats, giving a party at my expense. "

" She's giving it at your expense, madam, if she's giving it, " said Mr. Barrow, calmly. " Barrow& Skipworth are not responsible for anything. There never was a cleaner sweep made of a man's fortune. Captain Crewe died without paying OUR last bill - and it was a big one. "

Miss Minchin turned back from the door in increased indignation. This was worse than anyone could have dreamed of its being.

" That is what has happened to me! " she cried. " I was always so sure of his payments that I went to all sorts of ridiculous expenses for the child. I paid the bills for that ridiculous doll and her ridiculous fantastic wardrobe. The child was to have anything she wanted. She has a carriage and a pony and a maid, and I' ve paid for all of them since the last cheque came. "

Mr. Barrow evidently did not intend to remain to listen to the story of Miss Minchin's grievances after he had made the position of his firm clear and related the mere dry facts. He did not feel any particular sympathy for irate keepers of boarding - schools.

" You had better not pay for anything more, ma' am, " he remarked, " unless you want to make presents to the young lady. No one will remember you. She hasn' t a brass farthing to call her own. "

" But what am I to do? " demanded Miss Minchin, as if she felt it entirely his duty to make the matter right. " What am I to do? "

" There isn' t anything to do, " said Mr. Barrow, folding up his eye - glasses and slipping them into his pocket. " Captain Crewe is dead. The child is left a pauper. Nobody is responsible for her but you. "

" I am not responsible for her, and I refuse to be made responsible! "

Miss Minchin became quite white with rage.

Mr. Barrow turned to go.

" I have nothing to do with that, madam, " he said uninterestedly. " Barrow& Skipworth are not responsible. Very sorry the thing has happened, of course. "

" If you think she is to be foisted off on me, you are greatly mistaken, " Miss Minchin gasped. " I have been robbed and cheated; I will turn her into the street! "

If she had not been so furious, she would have been too discreet to say quite so much. She saw herself burdened with an extravagantly brought - up child whom she had always resented, and she lost all self - control.

Mr. Barrow undisturbedly moved toward the door. " I wouldn' t do that, madam, " he commented; " It wouldn' t look well. Unpleasant story to get about in connection with the establishment. Pupil bundled out penniless and without friends. "

He was a clever businessman, and he knew what he was saying. He also knew that Miss Minchin was a business woman, and would be shrewd enough to see the truth. She could not afford to do a thing which would make people speak of her as cruel and hard - hearted.

" Better keep her and make use of her, " he added. " She's a clever child, I believe. You can get a good deal out of her as she grows older. "

" I will get a good deal out of her before she grows older! " exclaimed Miss Minchin.

" I am sure you will, ma' am, " said Mr. Barrow, with a little sinister smile. " I am sure you will. Good morning! "

He bowed himself out and closed the door, and it must be confessed that Miss Minchin stood for a few moments and glared at it. What he had said was quite true. She knew it. She had absolutely no redress. Her show pupil had melted into nothingness, leaving only a friendless, beggared little girl. Such money as she herself had advanced was lost and could not be regained.

And as she stood there breathless under her sense of injury, there fell upon her ears a burst of gay voices from her own sacred room, which had actually been given up to the feast. She could at least stop this.

But as she started toward the door it was opened by Miss Amelia, who, when she caught sight of the changed, angry face, fell back a step in alarm.

" What IS the matter, sister? " she ejaculated.

Miss Minchin's voice was almost fierce when she answered:

" Where is Sara Crewe? "

Miss Amelia was bewildered.

" Sara! " she stammered. " Why, she's with the children in your room, of course. "

" Has she a black frock in her sumptuous wardrobe? " - in bitter irony.

" A black frock? " Miss Amelia stammered again. " A BLACK one? "

" She has frocks of every other color. Has she a black one? "

Miss Amelia began to turn pale.

" No - ye - es! " she said. " But it is too short for her. She has only the old black velvet, and she has outgrown it. "

" Go and tell her to take off that preposterous pink silk gauze, and put the black one on, whether it is too short or not. She has done with finery! "

Then Miss Amelia began to wring her fat hands and cry.

" Oh, sister! " she sniffed. " Oh, sister! What CAN have happened? "

Miss Minchin wasted no words.

" Captain Crewe is dead, " she said. " He has died without a penny. That spoiled, pampered, fanciful child is left a pauper on my hands. "

Miss Amelia sat down quite heavily in the nearest chair.

" Hundreds of pounds have I spent on nonsense for her. And I shall never see a penny of it. Put a stop to this ridiculous party of hers. Go and make her change her frock at once. "

" I? " panted Miss Amelia. " M - must I go and tell her now? "

" This moment! " was the fierce answer. " Don' t sit staring like a goose. Go! "

Poor Miss Amelia was accustomed to being called a goose. She knew, in fact, that she was rather a goose, and that it was left to geese to do a great many disagreeable things. It was a somewhat embarrassing thing to go into the midst of a room full of delighted children, and tell the giver of the feast that she had suddenly been transformed into a little beggar, and must go upstairs and put on an old black frock which was too small for her. But the thing must be done. This was evidently not the time when questions might be asked.

She rubbed her eyes with her handkerchief until they looked quite red. After which she got up and went out of the room, without venturing to say another word. When her older sister looked and spoke as she had done just now, the wisest course to pursue was to obey orders without any comment. Miss Minchin walked across the room. She spoke to herself aloud without knowing that she was doing it. During the last year the story of the diamond - mines had suggested all sorts of possibilities to her. Even proprietors of seminaries might make fortunes in stocks, with the aid of owners of mines. And now, instead of looking forward to gains, she was left to look back upon losses.

" The Princess Sara, indeed! " she said. " The child has been pampered as if she were a QUEEN. "

She was sweeping angrily past the corner table as she said it, and the next moment she started at the sound of a loud, sobbing sniff which issued from under the cover.

" What is that! " she exclaimed angrily. The loud, sobbing sniff was heard again, and she stooped and raised the hanging folds of the table - cover.

" How DARE you! " she cried out. " How dare you! Come out immed - iately! "

It was poor Becky who crawled out, and her cap was knocked on one side, and her face was red with repressed crying.

" If you please, ' m - it's me, mum, " she explained. " I know I hadn' t ought to. But I was lookin' at the doll, mum - an' I was frightened when you come in - an'slipped under the table. "

" You have been there all the time, listening, " said Miss Minchin.

" No, mum, " Becky protested, bobbing courtesies. " Not listenin' - I thought I could slip out without your noticin' , but I couldn' t an' I had to stay. But I didn' t listen, mum - I wouldn' t for nothin' . But I couldn' t help hearin' . "

Suddenly it seemed almost as if she lost all fear of the awful lady before her. She burst into fresh tears.

" Oh, please, ' m, " she said; " I dare say you' ll give me warnin' , mum - but I' m so sorry for poor Miss Sara - I' m so sorry! "

" Leave the room! " ordered Miss Minchin.

Becky courtesied again, the tears openly streaming down her cheeks.

" Yes, ' m; I will, ' m, " she said, trembling; " But oh, I just wanted to arst you: Miss Sara - she's been such a rich young lady, an'she's been waited on, ' and and foot; an' what will she do now, mum, without no maid? If - if, oh please, would you let me wait on her after I' ve done my pots an' kettles? I' d do' em that quick - if you' d let me wait on her now she's poor. Oh, " - breaking out afresh - " Poor little Miss Sara, mum - that was called a princess. "

Somehow, she made Miss Minchin feel more angry than ever. That the very scullery - maid should range herself on the side of this child - whom she realized more fully than ever that she had never liked - was too much. She actually stamped her foot.

" No - certainly not, " she said. " She will wait on herself, and on other people, too. Leave the room this instant, or you' ll leave your place. "

Becky threw her apron over her head and fled. She ran out of the room and down the steps into the scullery, and there she sat down among her pots and kettles, and wept as if her heart would break.

" It's exactly like the ones in the stories, " she wailed. " Them pore princess ones that was drove into the world. "

Miss Minchin had never looked quite so still and hard as she did when Sara came to her, a few hours later, in response to a message she had sent her.

Even by that time it seemed to Sara as if the birthday party had either been a dream or a thing which had happened years ago, and had happened in the life of quite another little girl.

Every sign of the festivities had been swept away; the holly had been removed from the schoolroom walls, and the forms and desks put back into their places. Miss Minchin's sitting - room looked as it always did - all traces of the feast were gone, and Miss Minchin had resumed her usual dress. The pupils had been ordered to lay aside their party frocks; and this having been done, they had returned to the schoolroom and huddled together in groups, whispering and talking excitedly.

" Tell Sara to come to my room, " Miss Minchin had said to her sister. " And explain to her clearly that I will have no crying or unpleasant scenes. "

" Sister, " replied Miss Amelia, " She is the strangest child I ever saw. She has actually made no fuss at all. You remember she made none when Captain Crewe went back to India. When I told her what had happened, she just stood quite still and looked at me without making a sound. Her eyes seemed to get bigger and bigger, and she went quite pale. When I had finished, she still stood staring for a few seconds, and then her chin began to shake, and she turned round and ran out of the room and upstairs. Several of the other children began to cry, but she did not seem to hear them or to be alive to anything but just what I was saying. It made me feel quite queer not to be answered; and when you tell anything sudden and strange, you expect people will say SOMETHING - whatever it is. "

Nobody but Sara herself ever knew what had happened in her room after she had run upstairs and locked her door. In fact, she herself scarcely remembered anything but that she walked up and down, saying over and over again to herself in a voice which did not seem her own:

" My papa is dead! My papa is dead! "

Once she stopped before Emily, who sat watching her from her chair, and cried out wildly:

" Emily! Do you hear? Do you hear - papa is dead? He is dead in India - thousands of miles away. "

When she came into Miss Minchin's sitting - room in answer to her summons, her face was white and her eyes had dark rings around them. Her mouth was set as if she did not wish it to reveal what she had suffered and was suffering. She did not look in the least like the rose - colored butterfly child who had flown about from one of her treasures to the other in the decorated schoolroom. She looked instead a strange, desolate, almost grotesque little figure.

She had put on, without Mariette's help, the cast - aside black - velvet frock. It was too short and tight, and her slender legs looked long and thin, showing themselves from beneath the brief skirt. As she had not found a piece of black ribbon, her short, thick, black hair tumbled loosely about her face and contrasted strongly with its pallor. She held Emily tightly in one arm, and Emily was swathed in a piece of black material.

" Put down your doll, " said Miss Minchin. " What do you mean by bringing her here? "

" No, " Sara answered. " I will not put her down. She is all I have. My papa gave her to me. "

She had always made Miss Minchin feel secretly uncomfortable, and she did so now. She did not speak with rudeness so much as with a cold steadiness with which Miss Minchin felt it difficult to cope - perhaps because she knew she was doing a heartless and inhuman thing.

" You will have no time for dolls in future, " she said. " You will have to work and improve yourself and make yourself useful. "

Sara kept her big, strange eyes fixed on her, and said not a word.

" Everything will be very different now, " Miss Minchin went on. " I suppose Miss Amelia has explained matters to you. "

" Yes, " answered Sara. " My papa is dead. He left me no money. I am quite poor. "

" You are a beggar, " said Miss Minchin, her temper rising at the recollection of what all this meant. " It appears that you have no relations and no home, and no one to take care of you. "

For a moment the thin, pale little face twitched, but Sara again said nothing.

" What are you staring at? " demanded Miss Minchin, sharply. " Are you so stupid that you cannot understand? I tell you that you are quite alone in the world, and have no one to do anything for you, unless I choose to keep you here out of charity. "

" I understand, " answered Sara, in a low tone; and there was a sound as if she had gulped down something which rose in her throat. " I understand. "

" That doll, " cried Miss Minchin, pointing to the splendid birthday gift seated near - " that ridiculous doll, with all her nonsensical, extravagant things - I actually paid the bill for her! "

Sara turned her head toward the chair.

" The Last Doll, " she said. " The Last Doll. " And her little mournful voice had an odd sound.

" The Last Doll, indeed! " said Miss Minchin. " And she is mine, not yours. Everything you own is mine. "

" Please take it away from me, then, " said Sara. " I do not want it. "

If she had cried and sobbed and seemed frightened. Miss Minchin might almost have had more patience with her. She was a woman who liked to domineer and feel her power, and as she looked at Sara's pale little steadfast face and heard her proud little voice, she quite felt as if her might was being set at naught.

" Don' t put on grand airs, " she said. " The time for that sort of thing is past. You are not a princess any longer. Your carriage and your pony will be sent away - your maid will be dismissed. You will wear your oldest and plainest clothes - your extravagant ones are no longer suited to your station. You are like Becky - you must work for your living. "

To her surprise, a faint gleam of light came into the child's eyes - a shade of relief.

" Can I work? " she said. " If I can work it will not matter so much. What can I do? "

" You can do anything you are told, " was the answer. " You are a sharp child, and pick up things readily. If you make yourself useful I may let you stay here. You speak French well, and you can help with the younger children. "

" May I? " exclaimed Sara. " Oh, please let me! I know I can teach them. I like them, and they like me. "

" Don' t talk nonsense about people liking you, " said Miss Minchin. " You will have to do more than teach the little ones. You will run errands and help in the kitchen as well as in the schoolroom. If you don' t please me, you will be sent away. Remember that. Now go. "

Sara stood still just a moment, looking at her. In her young soul, she was thinking deep and strange things. Then she turned to leave the room.

" Stop! " said Miss Minchin. " Don' t you intend to thank me? "

Sara paused, and all the deep, strange thoughts surged up in her breast.

" What for? " she said.

" For my kindness to you, " replied Miss Minchin. " For my kindness in giving you a home. "

Sara made two or three steps toward her. Her thin little chest heaved up and down, and she spoke in a strange, unchildishly fierce way.

" You are not kind, " she said. " You are NOT kind, and it is NOT a home. " And she had turned and run out of the room before Miss Minchin could stop her or do anything but stare after her with stony anger.

She went up the stairs slowly, but panting for breath, and she held Emily tightly against her side.

" I wish she could talk, " she said to herself. " If she could speak - if she could speak! "

She meant to go to her room and lie down on the tiger - skin, with her cheek upon the great cat's head, and look into the fire and think and think and think. But just before she reached the landing Miss Amelia came out of the door and closed it behind her, and stood before it, looking nervous and awkward. The truth was that she felt secretly ashamed of the thing she had been ordered to do.

" You - you are not to go in there, " she said.

" Not go in? " exclaimed Sara, and she fell back a pace.

" That is not your room now, " Miss Amelia answered, reddening a little.

Somehow, all at once, Sara understood. She realized that this was the beginning of the change Miss Minchin had spoken of.

" Where is my room? " she asked, hoping very much that her voice did not shake.

" You are to sleep in the attic next to Becky. "

Sara knew where it was. Becky had told her about it. She turned, and mounted up two flights of stairs. The last one was narrow, and covered with shabby strips of old carpet. She felt as if she were walking away and leaving far behind her the world in which that other child, who no longer seemed herself, had lived. This child, in her short, tight old frock, climbing the stairs to the attic, was quite a different creature.

When she reached the attic door and opened it, her heart gave a dreary little thump. Then she shut the door and stood against it and looked about her.

Yes, this was another world. The room had a slanting roof and was whitewashed. The whitewash was dingy and had fallen off in places. There was a rusty grate, an old iron bedstead, and a hard bed covered with a faded coverlet. Some pieces of furniture too much worn to be used downstairs had been sent up. Under the skylight in the roof, which showed nothing but an oblong piece of dull gray sky, there stood an old battered red footstool. Sara went to it and sat down. She seldom cried. She did not cry now. She laid Emily across her knees and put her face down upon her and her arms around her, and sat there, her little black head resting on the black draperies, not saying one word, not making one sound.

And as she sat in this silence there came a low tap at the door - such a low, humble one that she did not at first hear it, and, indeed, was not roused until the door was timidly pushed open and a poor tear - smeared face appeared peeping round it. It was Becky's face, and Becky had been crying furtively for hours and rubbing her eyes with her kitchen apron until she looked strange indeed.

" Oh, miss, " she said under her breath. " Might I - would you allow me - jest to come in? "

Sara lifted her head and looked at her. She tried to begin a smile, and somehow she could not. Suddenly - and it was all through the loving mournfulness of Becky's streaming eyes - her face looked more like a child's not so much too old for her years. She held out her hand and gave a little sob.

" Oh, Becky, " she said. " I told you we were just the same - only two little girls - just two little girls. You see how true it is. There's no difference now. I' m not a princess any more. "

Becky ran to her and caught her hand, and hugged it to her breast, kneeling beside her and sobbing with love and pain.

" Yes, miss, you are, " she cried, and her words were all broken. " Whats' ever' appens to you - whats' ever - you' d be a princess all the same - an' nothin' couldn' t make you nothin' different. "





CHAPTER Ⅷ　IN THE ATTIC


THE first night she spent in her attic was a thing Sara never forgot. During its passing, she lived through a wild, unchildlike woe of which she never spoke to anyone about her. There was no one who would have understood. It was, indeed, well for her that as she lay awake in the darkness her mind was forcibly distracted, now and then, by the strangeness of her surroundings. It was, perhaps, well for her that she was reminded by her small body of material things. If this had not been so, the anguish of her young mind might have been too great for a child to bear. But, really, while the night was passing she scarcely knew that she had a body at all or remembered any other thing than one.

" My papa is dead! " she kept whispering to herself. " My papa is dead! "

It was not until long afterward that she realized that her bed had been so hard that she turned over and over in it to find a place to rest, that the darkness seemed more intense than any she had ever known, and that the wind howled over the roof among the chimneys like something which wailed aloud. Then there was something worse. This was certain scufflings and scratchings and squeakings in the walls and behind the skirting boards. She knew what they meant, because Becky had described them. They meant rats and mice who were either fighting with each other or playing together. Once or twice she even heard sharp - toed feet scurrying across the floor, and she remembered in those after days, when she recalled things, that when first she heard them she started up in bed and sat trembling, and when she lay down again covered her head with the bedclothes.

The change in her life did not come about gradually, but was made all at once.

" She must begin as she is to go on, " Miss Minchin said to Miss Amelia. " She must be taught at once what she is to expect. "

Mariette had left the house the next morning. The glimpse Sara caught of her sitting - room, as she passed its open door, showed her that everything had been changed. Her ornaments and luxuries had been removed, and a bed had been placed in a corner to transform it into a new pupil's bedroom.

When she went down to breakfast she saw that her seat at Miss Minchin's side was occupied by Lavinia, and Miss Minchin spoke to her coldly.

" You will begin your new duties, Sara, " she said, " by taking your seat with the younger children at a smaller table. You must keep them quiet, and see that they behave well and do not waste their food. You ought to have been down earlier. Lottie has already upset her tea. "

That was the beginning, and from day to day the duties given to her were added to. She taught the younger children French and heard their other lessons, and these were the least of her labors. It was found that she could be made use of in numberless directions. She could be sent on errands at any time and in all weathers. She could be told to do things other people neglected. The cook and the housemaids took their tone from Miss Minchin, and rather enjoyed ordering about the " Young one " who had been made so much fuss over for so long. They were not servants of the best class, and had neither good manners nor good tempers, and it was frequently convenient to have at hand someone on whom blame could be laid.

During the first month or two, Sara thought that her willingness to do things as well as she could, and her silence under reproof, might soften those who drove her so hard. In her proud little heart she wanted them to see that she was trying to earn her living and not accepting charity. But the time came when she saw that no one was softened at all; and the more willing she was to do as she was told, the more domineering and exacting careless housemaids became, and the more ready a scolding cook was to blame her.

If she had been older, Miss Minchin would have given her the bigger girls to teach and saved money by dismissing an instructress; but while she remained and looked like a child, she could be made more useful as a sort of little superior errand girl and maid of all work. An ordinary errand boy would not have been so clever and reliable. Sara could be trusted with difficult commissions and complicated messages. She could even go and pay bills, and she combined with this the ability to dust a room well and to set things in order.

Her own lessons became things of the past. She was taught nothing, and only after long and busy days spent in running here and there at everybody's orders was she grudgingly allowed to go into the deserted schoolroom, with a pile of old books, and study alone at night.

" If I do not remind myself of the things I have learned, perhaps I may forget them, " she said to herself. " I am almost a scullery - maid, and if I am a scullery - maid who knows nothing, I shall be like poor Becky. I wonder if I could QUITE forget and begin to drop my H's and not remember that Henry the Eighth had six wives. "

One of the most curious things in her new existence was her changed position among the pupils. Instead of being a sort of small royal personage among them, she no longer seemed to be one of their number at all. She was kept so constantly at work that she scarcely ever had an opportunity of speaking to any of them, and she could not avoid seeing that Miss Minchin preferred that she should live a life apart from that of the occupants of the schoolroom.

" I will not have her forming intimacies and talking to the other children, " that lady said. " Girls like a grievance, and if she begins to tell romantic stories about herself, she will become an ill - used heroine, and parents will be given a wrong impression. It is better that she should live a separate life - one suited to her circumstances. I am giving her a home, and that is more than she has any right to expect from me. "

Sara did not expect much, and was far too proud to try to continue to be intimate with girls who evidently felt rather awkward and uncertain about her. The fact was that Miss Minchin's pupils were a set of dull, matter - of - fact young people. They were accustomed to being rich and comfortable, and as Sara's frocks grew shorter and shabbier and queerer - looking, and it became an established fact that she wore shoes with holes in them and was sent out to buy groceries and carry them through the streets in a basket on her arm when the cook wanted them in a hurry, they felt rather as if, when they spoke to her, they were addressing an under servant.

" To think that she was the girl with the diamond - mines, " Lavinia commented. " She does look an object. And she's queerer than ever. I never liked her much, but I can' t bear that way she has now of looking at people without speaking - just as if she was finding them out. "

" I am, " said Sara, promptly, when she heard of this. " That's what I look at some people for. I like to know about them. I think them over afterward. "

The truth was that she had saved herself annoyance several times by keeping her eye on Lavinia, who was quite ready to make mischief, and would have been rather pleased to have made it for the ex - show pupil.

Sara never made any mischief herself, or interfered with anyone. She worked like a drudge; she tramped through the wet streets, carrying parcels and baskets; she labored with the childish inattention of the little ones' French lessons; as she became shabbier and more forlorn - looking, she was told that she had better take her meals downstairs; she was treated as if she was nobody's concern, and her heart grew proud and sore, but she never told anyone what she felt.

" Soldiers don' t complain, " she would say between her small, shut teeth. " I am not going to do it; I will pretend this is part of a war. "

But there were hours when her child heart might almost have broken with loneliness but for three people.

The first, it must be owned, was Becky - just Becky. Throughout all that first night spent in the garret, she had felt a vague comfort in knowing that on the other side of the wall in which the rats scuffled and squeaked there was another young human creature. And during the nights that followed the sense of comfort grew. They had little chance to speak to each other during the day. Each had her own tasks to perform, and any attempt at conversation would have been regarded as a tendency to loiter and lose time.

" Don' t mind me, miss, " Becky whispered during the first morning, " If I don' t say nothin' polite. Some un' d be down on us if I did. I MEANS' please' an' ' thank you' an' ' beg pardon, ' but I dassn' t to take time to say it. "

But before daybreak she used to slip into Sara's attic and button her dress and give her such help as she required before she went down - stairs to light the kitchen fire. And when night came Sara always heard the humble knock at her door which meant that her handmaid was ready to help her again if she was needed. During the first weeks of her grief Sara felt as if she were too stupefied to talk, so it happened that some time passed before they saw each other much or exchanged visits. Becky's heart told her that it was best that people in trouble should be left alone.

The second of the trio of comforters was Ermengarde, but odd things happened before Ermengarde found her place.

When Sara's mind seemed to awaken again to the life about her, she realized that she had forgotten that an Ermengarde lived in the world. The two had always been friends, but Sara had felt as if she were years the older. It could not be contested that Ermengarde was as dull as she was affectionate. She clung to Sara in a simple, helpless way; she brought her lessons to her that she might be helped; she listened to her every word and besieged her with requests for stories. But she had nothing interesting to say herself, and she loathed books of every description. She was, in fact, not a person one would remember when one was caught in the storm of a great trouble, and Sara forgot her.

It had been all the easier to forget her because she had been suddenly called home for a few weeks. When she came back she did not see Sara for a day or two, and when she met her for the first time she encountered her coming down a corridor with her arms full of garments which were to be taken downstairs to be mended. Sara herself had already been taught to mend them. She looked pale and unlike herself, and she was attired in the queer, outgrown frock whose shortness showed so much thin black leg.

Ermengarde was too slow a girl to be equal to such a situation. She could not think of anything to say. She knew what had happened, but, somehow, she had never imagined Sara could look like this - so odd and poor and almost like a servant. It made her quite miserable, and she could do nothing but break into a short hysterical laugh and exclaim - aimlessly and as if without any meaning:

" Oh, Sara! is that you? "

" Yes, " answered Sara, and suddenly a strange thought passed through her mind and made her face flush.

She held the pile of garments in her arms, and her chin rested upon the top of it to keep it steady. Something in the look of her straight - gazing eyes made Ermengarde lose her wits still more. She felt as if Sara had changed into a new kind of girl, and she had never known her before. Perhaps it was because she had suddenly grown poor and had to mend things and work like Becky.

" Oh, " she stammered. " How - how are you? "

" I don' t know, " Sara replied. " How are you? "

" I' m - I' m quite well, " said Ermengarde, overwhelmed with shyness. Then spasmodically she thought of something to say which seemed more intimate. " Are you - are you very unhappy? " she said in a rush.

Then Sara was guilty of an injustice. Just at that moment her torn heart swelled within her, and she felt that if anyone was as stupid as that, one had better get away from her.

" What do you think? " she said. " Do you think I am very happy? " And she marched past her without another word.

In course of time she realized that if her wretchedness had not made her forget things, she would have known that poor, dull Ermengarde was not to be blamed for her unready, awkward ways. She was always awkward, and the more she felt, the more stupid she was given to being.

But the sudden thought which had flashed upon her had made her over - sensitive.

" She is like the others, " she had thought. " She does not really want to talk to me. She knows no one does. "

So for several weeks a barrier stood between them. When they met by chance Sara looked the other way, and Ermengarde felt too stiff and embarrassed to speak. Sometimes they nodded to each other in passing, but there were times when they did not even exchange a greeting.

" If she would rather not talk to me, " Sara thought, " I will keep out of her way. Miss Minchin makes that easy enough. "

Miss Minchin made it so easy that at last they scarcely saw each other at all. At that time it was noticed that Ermengarde was more stupid than ever, and that she looked listless and unhappy. She used to sit in the window - seat, huddled in a heap, and stare out of the window without speaking. Once Jessie, who was passing, stopped to look at her curiously.

" What are you crying for, Ermengarde? " she asked.

" I' m not crying, " answered Ermengarde, in a muffled, unsteady voice.

" You are, " said Jessie. " A great big tear just rolled down the bridge of your nose and dropped off at the end of it. And there goes another. "

" Well, " said Ermengarde, " I' m miserable - and no one need interfere. " And she turned her plump back and took out her handkerchief and boldly hid her face in it.

That night, when Sara went to her attic, she was later than usual. She had been kept at work until after the hour at which the pupils went to bed, and after that she had gone to her lessons in the lonely schoolroom. When she reached the top of the stairs, she was surprised to see a glimmer of light coming from under the attic door.

" Nobody goes there but myself, " she thought quickly; " But someone has lighted a candle. "

Someone had, indeed, lighted a candle, and it was not burning in the kitchen candlestick she was expected to use, but in one of those belonging to the pupils' bedrooms. The someone was sitting upon the battered footstool, and was dressed in her night - gown and wrapped up in a red shawl. It was Ermengarde.

" Ermengarde! " cried Sara. She was so startled that she was almost frightened. " You will get into trouble. "

Ermengarde stumbled up from her footstool. She shuffled across the attic in her bedroom slippers, which were too large for her. Her eyes and nose were pink with crying.

" I know I shall - if I' m found out, " she said. " But I don' t care - I don' t care a bit. Oh, Sara, please tell me. What is the matter? Why don' t you like me any more? "

Something in her voice made the familiar lump rise in Sara's throat. It was so affectionate and simple - so like the old Ermengarde who had asked her to be " Best friends. " It sounded as if she had not meant what she had seemed to mean during these past weeks.

" I do like you, " Sara answered. " I thought - you see, everything is different now. I thought you - were different. "

Ermengarde opened her wet eyes wide.

" Why, it was you who were different! " she cried. " You didn' t want to talk to me. I didn' t know what to do. It was you who were different after I came back. "

Sara thought a moment. She saw she had made a mistake.

" I AM different, " she explained, " Though not in the way you think. Miss Minchin does not want me to talk to the girls. Most of them don' t want to talk to me. I thought - perhaps " - you didn' t. So I tried to keep out of your way. "

" Oh, Sara, " Ermengarde almost wailed in her reproachful dismay. And then after one more look they rushed into each other's arms. It must be confessed that Sara's small black head lay for some minutes on the shoulder covered by the red shawl. When Ermengarde had seemed to desert her, she had felt horribly lonely.

Afterward they sat down upon the floor together, Sara clasping her knees with her arms, and Ermengarde rolled up in her shawl. Ermengarde looked at the odd, big - eyed little face adoringly.

" I couldn' t bear it any more, " she said. " I dare say you could live without me, Sara; but I couldn' t live without you. I was nearly DEAD. So tonight, when I was crying under the bedclothes, I thought all at once of creeping up here and just begging you to let us be friends again. "

" You are nicer than I am, " said Sara. " I was too proud to try and make friends. You see, now that trials have come, they have shown that I am NOT a nice child. I was afraid they would. Perhaps " - wrinkling her forehead wisely - " that is what they were sent for. "

" I don' t see any good in them, " said Ermengarde, stoutly.

" Neither do I - to speak the truth, " admitted Sara, frankly. " But I suppose there MIGHT be good in things, even if we don' t see it. There MIGHT " - DOUBTFULLY - " Be good in Miss Minchin. "

Ermengarde looked round the attic with a rather fearsome curiosity.

" Sara, " she said, " Do you think you can bear living here? "

Sara looked round also.

" If I pretend it's quite different, I can, " she answered; " Or if I pretend it is a place in a story. "

She spoke slowly. Her imagination was beginning to work for her. It had not worked for her at all since her troubles had come upon her. She had felt as if it had been stunned.

" Other people have lived in worse places. Think of the Count of Monte Cristo in the dungeons of the Chateau d' If. And think of the people in the Bastille! "

" The Bastille, " half whispered Ermengarde, watching her and beginning to be fascinated. She remembered stories of the French Revolution which Sara had been able to fix in her mind by her dramatic relation of them. No one but Sara could have done it.

A well - known glow came into Sara's eyes.

" Yes, " she said, hugging her knees. " that will be a good place to pretend about. I am a prisoner in the Bastille. I have been here for years and years - and years; and everybody has forgotten about me. Miss Minchin is the jailer - and Becky " - a sudden light adding itself to the glow in her eyes - " Becky is the prisoner in the next cell. "

She turned to Ermengarde, looking quite like the old Sara.

" I shall pretend that, " she said; " And it will be a great comfort. "

Ermengarde was at once enraptured and awed.

" And will you tell me all about it? " she said. " May I creep up here at night, whenever it is safe, and hear the things you have made up in the day? It will seem as if we were more' best friends' than ever. "

" Yes, " answered Sara, nodding. " Adversity tries people, and mine has tried you and proved how nice you are. "





CHAPTER Ⅸ　MELCHISEDEC


THE third person in the trio was Lottie. She was a small thing and did not know what adversity meant, and was much bewildered by the alteration she saw in her young adopted mother. She had heard it rumored that strange things had happened to Sara, but she could not understand why she looked different - why she wore an old black frock and came into the schoolroom only to teach instead of to sit in her place of honor and learn lessons herself. There had been much whispering among the little ones when it had been discovered that Sara no longer lived in the rooms in which Emily had so long sat in state. Lottie's chief difficulty was that Sara said so little when one asked her questions. At seven mysteries must be made very clear if one is to understand them.

" Are you very poor now, Sara? " she had asked confidentially the first morning her friend took charge of the small French class. " Are you as poor as a beggar? " She thrust a fat hand into the slim one and opened round, tearful eyes. " I don' t want you to be as poor as a beggar. "

She looked as if she was going to cry, and Sara hurriedly consoled her.

" Beggars have nowhere to live, " she said courageously. " I have a place to live in. "

" Where do you live? " persisted Lottie. " The new girl sleeps in your room, and it isn' t pretty any more. "

" I live in another room, " said Sara.

" Is it a nice one? " inquired Lottie. " I want to go and see it. "

" You must not talk, " said Sara. " Miss Minchin is looking at us. She will be angry with me for letting you whisper. "

She had found out already that she was to be held accountable for everything which was objected to. If the children were not attentive, if they talked, if they were restless, it was she who would be reproved.

But Lottie was a determined little person. If Sara would not tell her where she lived, she would find out in some other way. She talked to her small companions and hung about the elder girls and listened when they were gossiping; and acting upon certain information they had unconsciously let drop, she started late one afternoon on a voyage of discovery, climbing stairs she had never known the existence of, until she reached the attic floor. There she found two doors near each other, and opening one, she saw her beloved Sara standing upon an old table and looking out of a window.

" Sara! " she cried, aghast. " Mamma Sara! " She was aghast because the attic was so bare and ugly and seemed so far away from all the world. Her short legs had seemed to have been mounting hundreds of stairs.

Sara turned round at the sound of her voice. It was her turn to be aghast. What would happen now? If Lottie began to cry and any one chanced to hear, they were both lost. She jumped down from her table and ran to the child.

" Don' t cry and make a noise, " she implored. " I shall be scolded if you do, and I have been scolded all day. It's - it's not such a bad room, Lottie. "

" Isn' t it? " gasped Lottie, and as she looked round it she bit her lip. She was a spoiled child yet, but she was fond enough of her adopted parent to make an effort to control herself for her sake. Then, somehow, it was quite possible that any place in which Sara lived might turn out to be nice. " Why isn' t it, Sara? " she almost whispered.

Sara hugged her close and tried to laugh. There was a sort of comfort in the warmth of the plump, childish body. She had had a hard day and had been staring out of the windows with hot eyes.

" You can see all sorts of things you can' t see downstairs, " she said.

" What sort of things? " demanded Lottie, with that curiosity Sara could always awaken even in bigger girls.

" Chimneys - quite close to us - with smoke curling up in wreaths and clouds and going up into the sky - and sparrows hopping about and talking to each other just as if they were people - and other attic windows where heads may pop out any minute and you can wonder who they belong to. And it all feels as high up - as if it was another world. "

" Oh, let me see it! " cried Lottie. " Lift me up! "

Sara lifted her up, and they stood on the old table together and leaned on the edge of the flat window in the roof, and looked out.

Anyone who has not done this does not know what a different world they saw. The slates spread out on either side of them and slanted down into the rain gutter - pipes. The sparrows, being at home there, twittered and hopped about quite without fear. Two of them perched on the chimney - top nearest and quarrelled with each other fiercely until one pecked the other and drove him away. The garret window next to theirs was shut because the house next door was empty.

" I wish someone lived there, " Sara said. " It is so close that if there was a little girl in the attic, we could talk to each other through the windows and climb over to see each other, if we were not afraid of falling. "

The sky seemed so much nearer than when one saw it from the street, that Lottie was enchanted. From the attic window, among the chimney - pots, the things which were happening in the world below seemed almost unreal. One scarcely believed in the existence of Miss Minchin and Miss Amelia and the schoolroom, and the roll of wheels in the square seemed a sound belonging to another existence.

" Oh, Sara! " cried Lottie, cuddling in her guarding arm. " I like this attic - I like it! It is nicer than downstairs! "

" Look at that sparrow, " whispered Sara. " I wish I had some crumbs to throw to him. "

" I have some! " came in a little shriek from Lottie. " I have part of a bun in my pocket; I bought it with my penny yesterday, and I saved a bit. "

When they threw out a few crumbs the sparrow jumped and flew away to an adjacent chimney - top. He was evidently not accustomed to intimates in attics, and unexpected crumbs startled him. But when Lottie remained quite still and Sara chirped very softly - almost as if she were a sparrow herself - he saw that the thing which had alarmed him represented hospitality, after all. He put his head on one side, and from his perch on the chimney looked down at the crumbs with twinkling eyes. Lottie could scarcely keep still.

" Will he come? Will he come? " she whispered.

" His eyes look as if he would, " Sara whispered back. " He is thinking and thinking whether he dare. Yes, he will! Yes, he is coming! "

He flew down and hopped toward the crumbs, but stopped a few inches away from them, putting his head on one side again, as if reflecting on the chances that Sara and Lottie might turn out to be big cats and jump on him. At last his heart told him they were really nicer than they looked, and he hopped nearer and nearer, darted at the biggest crumb with a lightning peck, seized it, and carried it away to the other side of his chimney.

" Now he KNOWS, " said Sara. " And he will come back for the others. "

He did come back, and even brought a friend, and the friend went away and brought a relative, and among them they made a hearty meal over which they twittered and chattered and exclaimed, stopping every now and then to put their heads on one side and examine Lottie and Sara. Lottie was so delighted that she quite forgot her first shocked impression of the attic. In fact, when she was lifted down from the table and returned to earthly things, as it were, Sara was able to point out to her many beauties in the room which she herself would not have suspected the existence of.

" It is so little and so high above everything, " she said, " that it is almost like a nest in a tree. The slanting ceiling is so funny. See, you can scarcely stand up at this end of the room; and when the morning begins to come I can lie in bed and look right up into the sky through that flat window in the roof. It is like a square patch of light. If the sun is going to shine, little pink clouds float about, and I feel as if I could touch them. And if it rains, the drops patter and patter as if they were saying something nice. Then if there are stars, you can lie and try to count how many go into the patch. It takes such a lot. And just look at that tiny, rusty grate in the corner. If it was polished and there was a fire in it, just think how nice it would be. You see, it's really a beautiful little room. "

She was walking round the small place, holding Lottie's hand and making gestures which described all the beauties she was making herself see. She quite made Lottie see them, too. Lottie could always believe in the things Sara made pictures of.

" You see, " she said, " There could be a thick, soft blue Indian rug on the floor; and in that corner there could be a soft little sofa, with cushions to curl up on; and just over it could be a shelf full of books so that one could reach them easily; and there could be a fur rug before the fire, and hangings on the wall to cover up the whitewash, and pictures. They would have to be little ones, but they could be beautiful; and there could be a lamp with a deep rose - colored shade; and a table in the middle, with things to have tea with; and a little fat copper kettle singing on the hob; and the bed could be quite different. It could be made soft and covered with a lovely silk coverlet. It could be beautiful. And perhaps we could coax the sparrows until we made such friends with them that they would come and peck at the window and ask to be let in. "

" Oh, Sara! " cried Lottie; " I should like to live here! " When Sara had persuaded her to go downstairs again, and, after setting her in her way, had come back to her attic, she stood in the middle of it and looked about her. The enchantment of her imaginings for Lottie had died away. The bed was hard and covered with its dingy quilt. The whitewashed wall showed its broken patches, the floor was cold and bare, the grate was broken and rusty, and the battered footstool, tilted sideways on its injured leg, the only seat in the room. She sat down on it for a few minutes and let her head drop in her hands. The mere fact that Lottie had come and gone away again made things seem a little worse - just as perhaps prisoners feel a little more desolate after visitors come and go, leaving them behind.

" It's a lonely place, " she said. " Sometimes it's the loneliest place in the world. "

She was sitting in this way when her attention was attracted by a slight sound near her. She lifted her head to see where it came from, and if she had been a nervous child she would have left her seat on the battered footstool in a great hurry. A large rat was sitting up on his hind quarters and sniffing the air in an interested manner. Some of Lottie's crumbs had dropped upon the floor and their scent had drawn him out of his hole.

He looked so queer and so like a gray - whiskered dwarf or gnome that Sara was rather fascinated. He looked at her with his bright eyes, as if he were asking a question. He was evidently so doubtful that one of the child's queer thoughts came into her mind.

" I dare say it is rather hard to be a rat, " she mused. " Nobody likes you. People jump and run away and scream out, ' Oh, a horrid rat! ' I shouldn' t like people to scream and jump and say, ' Oh, a horrid Sara! ' the moment they saw me. And set traps for me, and pretend they were dinner. It's so different to be a sparrow. But nobody asked this rat if he wanted to be a rat when he was made. Nobody said, ' Wouldn' t you rather be a sparrow? ' "

She had sat so quietly that the rat had begun to take courage. He was very much afraid of her, but perhaps he had a heart like the sparrow and it told him that she was not a thing which pounced. He was very hungry. He had a wife and a large family in the wall, and they had had frightfully bad luck for several days. He had left the children crying bitterly, and felt he would risk a good deal for a few crumbs, so he cautiously dropped upon his feet.

" Come on, " said Sara; " I' m not a trap. You can have them, poor thing! Prisoners in the Bastille used to make friends with rats. Suppose I make friends with you. "

How it is that animals understand things I do not know, but it is certain that they do understand. Perhaps there is a language which is not made of words and everything in the world understands it. Perhaps there is a soul hidden in everything and it can always speak, without even making a sound, to another soul. But whatsoever was the reason, the rat knew from that moment that he was safe - even though he was a rat. He knew that this young human being sitting on the red footstool would not jump up and terrify him with wild, sharp noises or throw heavy objects at him which, if they did not fall and crush him, would send him limping in his scurry back to his hole. He was really a very nice rat, and did not mean the least harm. When he had stood on his hind legs and sniffed the air, with his bright eyes fixed on Sara, he had hoped that she would understand this, and would not begin by hating him as an enemy. When the mysterious thing which speaks without saying any words told him that she would not, he went softly toward the crumbs and began to eat them. As he did it he glanced every now and then at Sara, just as the sparrows had done, and his expression was so very apologetic that it touched her heart.

She sat and watched him without making any movement. One crumb was very much larger than the others - in fact, it could scarcely be called a crumb. It was evident that he wanted that piece very much, but it lay quite near the footstool and he was still rather timid.

" I believe he wants it to carry to his family in the wall, " Sara thought. " If I do not stir at all, perhaps he will come and get it. "

She scarcely allowed herself to breathe, she was so deeply interested. The rat shuffled a little nearer and ate a few more crumbs, then he stopped and sniffed delicately, giving a side glance at the occupant of the footstool; then he darted at the piece of bun with something very like the sudden boldness of the sparrow, and the instant he had possession of it fled back to the wall, slipped down a crack in the skirting board, and was gone.

" I knew he wanted it for his children, " said Sara. " I do believe I could make friends with him. "

A week or so afterward, on one of the rare nights when Ermengarde found it safe to steal up to the attic, when she tapped on the door with the tips of her fingers Sara did not come to her for two or three minutes. There was, indeed, such a silence in the room at first that Ermengarde wondered if she could have fallen asleep. Then, to her surprise, she heard her utter a little, low laugh and speak coaxingly to someone.

" There! " Ermengarde heard her say. " Take it and go home, Melchisedec! Go home to your wife! "

Almost immediately Sara opened the door, and when she did so she found Ermengarde standing with alarmed eyes upon the threshold.

" Who - who ARE you talking to, Sara? " she gasped out.

Sara drew her in cautiously, but she looked as if something pleased and amused her.

" You must promise not to be frightened - not to scream the least bit, or I can' t tell you, " she answered.

Ermengarde felt almost inclined to scream on the spot, but managed to control herself. She looked all round the attic and saw no one. And yet Sara had certainly been speaking TO someone. She thought of ghosts.

" Is it - something that will frighten me? " she asked timorously.

" Some people are afraid of them, " said Sara. " I was at first - but I am not now. "

" Was it - a ghost? " quaked Ermengarde.

" No, " said Sara, laughing. " It was my rat. "

Ermengarde made one bound, and landed in the middle of the little dingy bed. She tucked her feet under her night - gown and the red shawl. She did not scream, but she gasped with fright.

" Oh! oh! " she cried under her breath. " A rat! A rat! "

" I was afraid you would be frightened, " said Sara. " But you needn' t be. I am making him tame. He actually knows me and comes out when I call him. Are you too frightened to want to see him? "

The truth was that, as the days had gone on and, with the aid of scraps brought up from the kitchen, her curious friendship had developed, she had gradually forgotten that the timid creature she was becoming familiar with was a mere rat.

At first Ermengarde was too much alarmed to do anything but huddle in a heap upon the bed and tuck up her feet, but the sight of Sara's composed little countenance and the story of Melchisedec's first appearance began at last to rouse her curiosity, and she leaned forward over the edge of the bed and watched Sara go and kneel down by the hole in the skirting board.

" He - he won' t run out quickly and jump on the bed, will he? " she said.

" No, " answered Sara. " He's as polite as we are. He is just like a person. Now watch! "

She began to make a low, whistling sound - so low and coaxing that it could only have been heard in entire stillness. She did it several times, looking entirely absorbed in it. Ermengarde thought she looked as if she were working a spell. And at last, evidently in response to it, a gray - whiskered, bright - eyed head peeped out of the hole. Sara had some crumbs in her hand. She dropped them, and Melchisedec came quietly forth and ate them. A piece of larger size than the rest he took and carried in the most businesslike manner back to his home.

" You see, " said Sara, " that is for his wife and children. He is very nice. He only eats the little bits. After he goes back I can always hear his family squeaking for joy. There are three kinds of squeaks. One kind is the children's, and one is Mrs. Melchisedec's, and one is Melchisedec's own. "

Ermengarde began to laugh.

" Oh, Sara! " she said. " You ARE queer - but you are nice. "

" I know I am queer, " admitted Sara, cheerfully; " And I TRY to be nice. " She rubbed her forehead with her little brown paw, and a puzzled, tender look came into her face. " Papa always laughed at me, " she said; " But I liked it. He thought I was queer, but he liked me to make up things. I - I can' t help making up things. If I didn' t, I don' t believe I could live. " She paused and glanced round the attic. " I' m sure I couldn' t live here, " she added in a low voice.

Ermengarde was interested, as she always was. " When you talk about things, " she said, " they seem as if they grew real. You talk about Melchisedec as if he was a person. "

" He IS a person, " said Sara. " He gets hungry and frightened, just as we do; and he is married and has children. How do we know he doesn' t think things, just as we do? His eyes look as if he was a person. That was why I gave him a name. "

She sat down on the floor in her favorite attitude, holding her knees.

" Besides, " she said, " He is a Bastille rat sent to be my friend. I can always get a bit of bread the cook has thrown away, and it is quite enough to support him. "

" Is it the Bastille yet? " asked Ermengarde, eagerly. " Do you always pretend it is the Bastille? "

" Nearly always, " answered Sara. " Sometimes I try to pretend it is another kind of place; but the Bastille is generally easiest - particularly when it is cold. "

Just at that moment Ermengarde almost jumped off the bed, she was so startled by a sound she heard. It was like two distinct knocks on the wall.

" What is that? " she exclaimed.

Sara got up from the floor and answered quite dramatically:

" It is the prisoner in the next cell. "

" Becky! " cried Ermengarde, enraptured.

" Yes, " said Sara. " Listen; the two knocks meant, ' Prisoner, are you there? ' "

She knocked three times on the wall herself, as if in answer.

" That means, ' Yes, I am here, and all is well. ' "

Four knocks came from Becky's side of the wall.

" That means, " explained Sara, " ' Then, fellow - sufferer, we will sleep in peace. Good - night. ' "

Ermengarde quite beamed with delight.

" Oh, Sara! " she whispered joyfully. " It is like a story! "

" It IS a story, " said Sara. " EVERTHING's a story. You are a story - I am a story. Miss Minchin is a story. "

And she sat down again and talked until Ermengarde forgot that she was a sort of escaped prisoner herself, and had to be reminded by Sara that she could not remain in the Bastille all night, but must steal noiselessly downstairs again and creep back into her deserted bed.





CHAPTER Ⅹ　THE INDIAN GENTLEMAN


BUT it was a perilous thing for Ermengarde and Lottie to make pilgrimages to the attic. They could never be quite sure when Sara would be there, and they could scarcely ever be certain that Miss Amelia would not make a tour of inspection through the bedrooms after the pupils were supposed to be asleep. So their visits were rare ones, and Sara lived a strange and lonely life. It was a lonelier life when she was downstairs than when she was in her attic. She had no one to talk to; and when she was sent out on errands and walked through the streets, a forlorn little figure carrying a basket or a parcel, trying to hold her hat on when the wind was blowing, and feeling the water soak through her shoes when it was raining, she felt as if the crowds hurrying past her made her loneliness greater. When she had been the Princess Sara, driving through the streets in her brougham, or walking, attended by Mariette, the sight of her bright, eager little face and picturesque coats and hats had often caused people to look after her. A happy, beautifully cared for little girl naturally attracts attention. Shabby, poorly dressed children are not rare enough and pretty enough to make people turn around to look at them and smile. No one looked at Sara in these days, and no one seemed to see her as she hurried along the crowded pavements. She had begun to grow very fast, and, as she was dressed only in such clothes as the plainer remnants of her wardrobe would supply, she knew she looked very queer, indeed. All her valuable garments had been disposed of, and such as had been left for her use she was expected to wear so long as she could put them on at all. Sometimes, when she passed a shop window with a mirror in it, she almost laughed outright on catching a glimpse of herself, and sometimes her face went red and she bit her lip and turned away.

In the evening, when she passed houses whose windows were lighted up, she used to look into the warm rooms and amuse herself by imagining things about the people she saw sitting before the fires or about the tables. It always interested her to catch glimpses of rooms before the shutters were closed. There were several families in the square in which Miss Minchin lived, with which she had become quite familiar in a way of her own. The one she liked best she called the Large Family. She called it the Large Family not because the members of it were big - for, indeed, most of them were little - but because there were so many of them. There were eight children in the Large Family, and a stout, rosy mother, and a stout, rosy father, and a stout, rosy grandmother, and any number of servants. The eight children were always either being taken out to walk or to ride in perambulators by comfortable nurses, or they were going to drive with their mamma, or they were flying to the door in the evening to meet their papa and kiss him and dance around him and drag off his overcoat and look in the pockets for packages, or they were crowding about the nursery windows and looking out and pushing each other and laughing - in fact, they were always doing something enjoyable and suited to the tastes of a large family. Sara was quite fond of them, and had given them names out of books - quite romantic names. She called them the Montmorencys when she did not call them the Large Family. The fat, fair baby with the lace cap was Ethelberta Beauchamp Montmorency; the next baby was Violet Cholmondeley Montmorency; the little boy who could just stagger and who had such round legs was Sydney Cecil Vivian Montmorency; and then came Lilian Evangeline Maud Marion, Rosalind Gladys, Guy Clarence, Veronica Eustacia, and Claude Harold Hector.

One evening a very funny thing happened - though, perhaps, in one sense it was not a funny thing at all.

Several of the Montmorencys were evidently going to a children's party, and just as Sara was about to pass the door they were crossing the pavement to get into the carriage which was waiting for them. Veronica Eustacia and Rosalind Gladys, in white - lace frocks and lovely sashes, had just got in, and Guy Clarence, aged five, was following them. He was such a pretty fellow and had such rosy cheeks and blue eyes, and such a darling little round head covered with curls, that Sara forgot her basket and shabby cloak altogether - in fact, forgot everything but that she wanted to look at him for a moment. So she paused and looked.

It was Christmas time, and the Large Family had been hearing many stories about children who were poor and had no mammas and papas to fill their stockings and take them to the pantomime - children who were, in fact, cold and thinly clad and hungry. In the stories, kind people - sometimes little boys and girls with tender hearts - invariably saw the poor children and gave them money or rich gifts, or took them home to beautiful dinners. Guy Clarence had been affected to tears that very afternoon by the reading of such a story, and he had burned with a desire to find such a poor child and give her a certain sixpence he possessed, and thus provide for her for life. An entire sixpence, he was sure, would mean affluence for evermore. As he crossed the strip of red carpet laid across the pavement from the door to the carriage, he had this very sixpence in the pocket of his very short man - o - war trousers. And just as Rosalind Gladys got into the vehicle and jumped on to the seat in order to feel the cushions spring under her, he saw Sara standing on the wet pavement in her shabby frock and hat, with her old basket on her arm, looking at him hungrily.

He thought that her eyes looked hungry because she had perhaps had nothing to eat for a long time. He did not know that they looked so because she was hungry for the warm, merry life his home held and his rosy face spoke of, and that she had a hungry wish to snatch him in her arms and kiss him. He only knew that she had big eyes and a thin face and thin legs and a common basket and poor clothes. So he put his hand in his pocket and found his sixpence and walked up to her benignly.

" Here, poor little girl, " he said. " Here is a sixpence. I will give it to you. "

Sara started, and all at once realized that she looked exactly like poor children she had seen, in her better days, waiting on the pavement to watch her as she got out of her brougham. And she had given them pennies many a time. Her face went red and then it went pale, and for a second she felt as if she could not take the dear little sixpence.

" Oh, no! " she said. " Oh, no, thank you; I mustn' t take it, indeed! "

Her voice was so unlike an ordinary street child's voice and her manner was so like the manner of a well - bred little person that Veronica Eustacia( whose real name was Janet) and Rosalind Gladys( who was really called Nora) leaned forward to listen.

But Guy Clarence was not to be thwarted in his benevolence. He thrust the sixpence into her hand.

" Yes, you must take it, poor little girl! " he insisted stoutly. " You can buy things to eat with it. It is a whole sixpence! "

There was something so honest and kind in his face, and he looked so likely to be heartbrokenly disappointed if she did not take it, that Sara knew she must not refuse him. To be as proud as that would be a cruel thing. So she actually put her pride in her pocket, though it must be admitted her cheeks burned.

" Thank you, " she said. " You are a kind, kind little darling thing. " And as he scrambled joyfully into the carriage she went away, trying to smile, though she caught her breath quickly and her eyes were shining through a mist. She had known that she looked odd and shabby, but until now she had not known that she might be taken for a beggar.

As the Large Family's carriage drove away, the children inside it were talking with interested excitement.

" Oh, Donald " ( this was Guy Clarence's name) , Janet exclaimed alarmedly, " Why did you offer that little girl your sixpence? I' m sure she is not a beggar! "

" She didn' t speak like a beggar! " cried Nora; " And her face didn' t really look like a beggar's face! "

" Besides, she didn' t beg, " said Janet. " I was so afraid she might be angry with you. You know, it makes people angry to be taken for beggars when they are not beggars. "

" She wasn' t angry, " said Donald, a trifle dismayed, but still firm. " She laughed a little, and she said I was a kind, kind little darling thing. And I was! " - stoutly. " It was my whole sixpence. "

Janet and Nora exchanged glances.

" A beggar girl would never have said that, " decided Janet. " She would have said, ' Thank yer kindly, little gentleman - thank yer, sir' ; and perhaps she would have bobbed a curtsy. "

Sara knew nothing about the fact, but from that time the Large Family was as profoundly interested in her as she was in it. Faces used to appear at the nursery windows when she passed, and many discussions concerning her were held round the fire.

" She is a kind of servant at the seminary, " Janet said. " I don' t believe she belongs to anybody. I believe she is an orphan. But she is not a beggar, however shabby she looks. "

And afterward she was called by all of them, " The - little - girl - who - is - not - a - beggar, " which was, of course, rather a long name, and sounded very funny sometimes when the youngest ones said it in a hurry.

Sara managed to bore a hole in the sixpence and hung it on an old bit of narrow ribbon round her neck. Her affection for the Large Family increased - as, indeed, her affection for everything she could love increased. She grew fonder and fonder of Becky, and she used to look forward to the two mornings a week when she went into the schoolroom to give the little ones their French lesson. Her small pupils loved her, and strove with each other for the privilege of standing close to her and insinuating their small hands into hers. It fed her hungry heart to feel them nestling up to her. She made such friends with the sparrows that when she stood upon the table, put her head and shoulders out of the attic window, and chirped, she heard almost immediately a flutter of wings and answering twitters, and a little flock of dingy town birds appeared and alighted on the slates to talk to her and make much of the crumbs she scattered. With Melchisedec she had become so intimate that he actually brought Mrs. Melchisedec with him sometimes, and now and then one or two of his children. She used to talk to him, and, somehow, he looked quite as if he understood.

There had grown in her mind rather a strange feeling about Emily, who always sat and looked on at everything. It arose in one of her moments of great desolateness. She would have liked to believe or pretend to believe that Emily understood and sympathized with her. She did not like to own to herself that her only companion could feel and hear nothing. She used to put her in a chair sometimes and sit opposite to her on the old red footstool, and stare and pretend about her until her own eyes would grow large with something which was almost like fear - particularly at night when everything was so still, when the only sound in the attic was the occasional sudden scurry and squeak of Melchisedec's family in the wall. One of her " pretends " was that Emily was a kind of good witch who could protect her. Sometimes, after she had stared at her until she was wrought up to the highest pitch of fancifulness, she would ask her questions and find herself ALMOST feeling as if she would presently answer. But she never did.

" As to answering, though, " said Sara, trying to console herself, " I don' t answer very often. I never answer when I can help it. When people are insulting you, there is nothing so good for them as not to say a word - just to look at them and THINK. Miss Minchin turns pale with rage when I do it, Miss Amelia looks frightened, and so do the girls. When you will not fly into a passion people know you are stronger than they are, because you are strong enough to hold in your rage, and they are not, and they say stupid things they wish they hadn' t said afterward. There's nothing so strong as rage, except what makes you hold it in - that's stronger. It's a good thing not to answer your enemies. I scarcely ever do. Perhaps Emily is more like me than I am like myself. Perhaps she would rather not answer her friends, even. She keeps it all in her heart. "

But though she tried to satisfy herself with these arguments, she did not find it easy. When, after a long, hard day, in which she had been sent here and there, sometimes on long errands through wind and cold and rain, she came in wet and hungry, and was sent out again because nobody chose to remember that she was only a child, and that her slim legs might be tired and her small body might be chilled; when she had been given only harsh words and cold, slighting looks for thanks; when the cook had been vulgar and insolent; when Miss Minchin had been in her worst mood, and when she had seen the girls sneering among themselves at her shabbiness - then she was not always able to comfort her sore, proud, desolate heart with fancies when Emily merely sat upright in her old chair and stared.

One of these nights, when she came up to the attic cold and hungry, with a tempest raging in her young breast, Emily's stare seemed so vacant, her sawdust legs and arms so inexpressive, that Sara lost all control over herself. There was nobody but Emily - no one in the world. And there she sat.

" I shall die presently, " she said at first.

Emily simply stared.

" I can' t bear this, " said the poor child, trembling. " I know I shall die. I' m cold; I' m wet; I' m starving to death. I' ve walked a thousand miles to - day, and they have done nothing but scold me from morning until night. And because I could not find that last thing the cook sent me for, they would not give me any supper. Some men laughed at me because my old shoes made me slip down in the mud. I' m covered with mud now. And they laughed. Do you hear? "

She looked at the staring glass eyes and complacent face, and suddenly a sort of heartbroken rage seized her. She lifted her little savage hand and knocked Emily off the chair, bursting into a passion of sobbing - Sara who never cried.

" You are nothing but a DOLL! " she cried; " Nothing but a doll - doll - doll! You care for nothing. You are stuffed with sawdust. You never had a heart. Nothing could ever make you feel. You are a DOLL! "

Emily lay on the floor, with her legs ignominiously doubled up over her head, and a new flat place on the end of her nose; but she was calm, even dignified. Sara hid her face in her arms. The rats in the wall began to fight and bite each other and squeak and scramble. Melchisedec was chastising some of his family.

Sara's sobs gradually quieted themselves. It was so unlike her to break down that she was surprised at herself. After a while she raised her face and looked at Emily, who seemed to be gazing at her round the side of one angle, and, somehow, by this time actually with a kind of glassy - eyed sympathy. Sara bent and picked her up. Remorse overtook her. She even smiled at herself a very little smile.

" You can' t help being a doll, " she said with a resigned sigh, " Any more than Lavinia and Jessie can help not having any sense. We are not all made alike. Perhaps you do your sawdust best. " And she kissed her and shook her clothes straight, and put her back upon her chair.

She had wished very much that some one would take the empty house next door. She wished it because of the attic window which was so near hers. It seemed as if it would be so nice to see it propped open some - day and a head and shoulders rising out of the square aperture.

" If it looked a nice head, " she thought, " I might begin by saying, ' Good morning, ' and all sorts of things might happen. But, of course, it's not really likely that anyone but under servants would sleep there. "

One morning, on turning the corner of the square after a visit to the grocer's, the butcher's, and the baker's, she saw, to her great delight, that during her rather prolonged absence, a van full of furniture had stopped before the next house, the front doors were thrown open, and men in shirt sleeves were going in and out carrying heavy packages and pieces of furniture.

" It's taken! " she said. " It really IS taken! Oh, I do hope a nice head will look out of the attic window! "

She would almost have liked to join the group of loiterers who had stopped on the pavement to watch the things carried in. She had an idea that if she could see some of the furniture she could guess something about the people it belonged to.

" Miss Minchin's tables and chairs are just like her, " she thought; " I remember thinking that the first minute I saw her, even though I was so little. I told papa afterward, and he laughed and said it was true. I am sure the Large Family have fat, comfortable armchairs and sofas, and I can see that their red - flowery wallpaper is exactly like them. It's warm and cheerful and kind - looking and happy. "

She was sent out for parsley to the greengrocer's later in the day, and when she came up the area steps her heart gave quite a quick beat of recognition. Several pieces of furniture had been set out of the van upon the pavement. There was a beautiful table of elaborately wrought teakwood, and some chairs, and a screen covered with rich Oriental embroidery. The sight of them gave her a weird, homesick feeling. She had seen things so like them in India. One of the things Miss Minchin had taken from her was a carved teakwood desk her father had sent her.

" They are beautiful things, " she said; " they look as if they ought to belong to a nice person. All the things look rather grand. I suppose it is a rich family. "

The vans of furniture came and were unloaded and gave place to others all the day. Several times it so happened that Sara had an opportunity of seeing things carried in. It became plain that she had been right in guessing that the newcomers were people of large means. All the furniture was rich and beautiful, and a great deal of it was Oriental. Wonderful rugs and draperies and ornaments were taken from the vans, many pictures, and books enough for a library. Among other things there was a superb god Buddha in a splendid shrine.

" Someone in the family MUST have been in India, " Sara thought. " They have got used to Indian things and like them. I AM glad. I shall feel as if they were friends, even if a head never looks out of the attic window. "

When she was taking in the evening's milk for the cook( there was really no odd job she was not called upon to do) , she saw something occur which made the situation more interesting than ever. The handsome, rosy man who was the father of the Large Family walked across the square in the most matter - of - fact manner, and ran up the steps of the next - door house. He ran up them as if he felt quite at home and expected to run up and down them many a time in the future. He stayed inside quite a long time, and several times came out and gave directions to the workmen, as if he had a right to do so. It was quite certain that he was in some intimate way connected with the newcomers and was acting for them.

" If the new people have children, " Sara speculated, " the Large Family children will be sure to come and play with them, and they MIGHT come up into the attic just for fun. "

At night, after her work was done, Becky came in to see her fellow - prisoner and bring her news.

" It's a' Nindian gentleman that's comin' to live next door, miss, " she said. " I don' t know whether he's a black gentleman or not, but he's a Nindian one. He's very rich, an' he's ill, an' the gentleman of the Large Family is his lawyer. He's had a lot of trouble, an' it's made him ill an' low in his mind. He worships idols, miss. He's an' eathen an' bows down to wood an'stone. I seen a' idol bein' carried in for him to worship. Somebody had oughter send him a trac' . You can get a trac' for a penny. "

Sara laughed a little.

" I don' t believe he worships that idol, " she said; " some people like to keep them to look at because they are interesting. My papa had a beautiful one, and he did not worship it. "

But Becky was rather inclined to prefer to believe that the new neighbor was " An' eathen. " It sounded so much more romantic than that he should merely be the ordinary kind of gentleman who went to church with a prayer - book. She sat and talked long that night of what he would be like, of what his wife would be like if he had one, and of what his children would be like if they had children. Sara saw that privately she could not help hoping very much that they would all be black, and would wear turbans, and, above all, that - like their parent - they would all be " ' eathens. "

" I never lived next door to no' eathens, miss, " she said; " I should like to see what sort o' ways they' d have. "

It was several weeks before her curiosity was satisfied, and then it was revealed that the new occupant had neither wife nor children. He was a solitary man with no family at all, and it was evident that he was shattered in health and unhappy in mind.

A carriage drove up one day and stopped before the house. When the footman dismounted from the box and opened the door the gentleman who was the father of the Large Family got out first. After him there descended a nurse in uniform, then came down the steps two men - servants. They came to assist their master, who, when he was helped out of the carriage, proved to be a man with a haggard, distressed face, and a skeleton body wrapped in furs. He was carried up the steps, and the head of the Large Family went with him, looking very anxious.

Shortly afterward a doctor's carriage arrived, and the doctor went in - plainly to take care of him.

" There is such a yellow gentleman next door, Sara, " Lottie whispered at the French class afterward. " Do you think he is a Chinee? The geography says the Chinee men are yellow. "

" No, he is not Chinese, " Sara whispered back; " He is very ill. Go on with your exercise, Lottie. ' Non, monsieur. Je n' ai pas le canif de mon oncle. ' "

That was the beginning of the story of the Indian gentleman.





CHAPTER Ⅺ　RAM DASS


THERE were fine sunsets even in the square, sometimes. One could only see parts of them, however, between the chimneys and over the roofs. From the kitchen windows one could not see them at all, and could only guess that they were going on because the bricks looked warm and the air rosy or yellow for a while, or perhaps one saw a blazing glow strike a particular pane of glass somewhere. There was, however, one place from which one could see all the splendor of them: the piles of red or gold clouds in the west; or the purple ones edged with dazzling brightness; or the little fleecy, floating ones, tinged with rose - color and looking like flights of pink doves scurrying across the blue in a great hurry if there was a wind. The place where one could see all this, and seem at the same time to breathe a purer air, was, of course, the attic window. When the square suddenly seemed to begin to glow in an enchanted way and look wonderful in spite of its sooty trees and railings, Sara knew something was going on in the sky; and when it was at all possible to leave the kitchen without being missed or called back, she invariably stole away and crept up the flights of stairs, and, climbing on the old table, got her head and body as far out of the window as possible. When she had accomplished this, she always drew a long breath and looked all round her. It used to seem as if she had all the sky and the world to herself. No one else ever looked out of the other attics. Generally the skylights were closed; but even if they were propped open to admit air, no one seemed to come near them. And there Sara would stand, sometimes turning her face upward to the blue which seemed so friendly and near - just like a lovely vaulted ceiling - sometimes watching the west and all the wonderful things that happened there: the clouds melting or drifting or waiting softly to be changed pink or crimson or snow - white or purple or pale dove - gray. Sometimes they made islands or great mountains enclosing lakes of deep turquoise - blue, or liquid amber, or chrysoprase - green; sometimes dark headlands jutted into strange, lost seas; sometimes slender strips of wonderful lands joined other wonderful lands together. There were places where it seemed that one could run or climb or stand and wait to see what next was coming - until, perhaps, as it all melted, one could float away. At least it seemed so to Sara, and nothing had ever been quite so beautiful to her as the things she saw as she stood on the table - her body half out of the skylight - the sparrows twittering with sunset softness on the slates. The sparrows always seemed to her to twitter with a sort of subdued softness just when these marvels were going on.

There was such a sunset as this a few days after the Indian gentleman was brought to his new home; and, as it fortunately happened that the afternoon's work was done in the kitchen and nobody had ordered her to go anywhere or perform any task, Sara found it easier than usual to slip away and go upstairs.

She mounted her table and stood looking out. It was a wonderful moment. There were floods of molten gold covering the west, as if a glorious tide was sweeping over the world. A deep, rich yellow light filled the air; the birds flying across the tops of the houses showed quite black against it.

" It's a Splendid one, " said Sara, softly, to herself. " It makes me feel almost afraid - as if something strange was just going to happen. The Splendid ones always make me feel like that. "

She suddenly turned her head because she heard a sound a few yards away from her. It was an odd sound like a queer little squeaky chattering. It came from the window of the next attic. Someone had come to look at the sunset as she had. There was a head and part of a body emerging from the skylight, but it was not the head or body of a little girl or a housemaid; it was the picturesque white - swathed form and dark - faced, gleaming - eyed, white - turbaned head of a native Indian man - servant - " a Lascar, " Sara said to herself quickly - and the sound she had heard came from a small monkey he held in his arms as if he were fond of it, and which was snuggling and chattering against his breast.

As Sara looked toward him he looked toward her. The first thing she thought was that his dark face looked sorrowful and homesick. She felt absolutely sure he had come up to look at the sun, because he had seen it so seldom in England that he longed for a sight of it. She looked at him interestedly for a second, and then smiled across the slates. She had learned to know how comforting a smile, even from a stranger, may be.

Hers was evidently a pleasure to him. His whole expression altered, and he showed such gleaming white teeth as he smiled back that it was as if a light had been illuminated in his dusky face. The friendly look in Sara's eyes was always very effective when people felt tired or dull.

It was perhaps in making his salute to her that he loosened his hold on the monkey. He was an impish monkey and always ready for adventure, and it is probable that the sight of a little girl excited him. He suddenly broke loose, jumped on to the slates, ran across them chattering, and actually leaped on to Sara's shoulder, and from there down into her attic room. It made her laugh and delighted her; but she knew he must be restored to his master - if the Lascar was his master - and she wondered how this was to be done. Would he let her catch him, or would he be naughty and refuse to be caught, and perhaps get away and run off over the roofs and be lost? That would not do at all. Perhaps he belonged to the Indian gentleman, and the poor man was fond of him.

She turned to the Lascar, feeling glad that she remembered still some of the Hindustani she had learned when she lived with her father. She could make the man understand. She spoke to him in the language he knew.

" Will he let me catch him? " she asked.

She thought she had never seen more surprise and delight than the dark face expressed when she spoke in the familiar tongue. The truth was that the poor fellow felt as if his gods had intervened, and the kind little voice came from heaven itself. At once Sara saw that he had been accustomed to European children. He poured forth a flood of respectful thanks. He was the servant of Missee Sahib. The monkey was a good monkey and would not bite; but, unfortunately, he was difficult to catch. He would flee from one spot to another, like the lightning. He was disobedient, though not evil. Ram Dass knew him as if he were his child, and Ram Dass he would sometimes obey, but not always. If Missee Sahib would permit Ram Dass, he himself could cross the roof to her room, enter the windows, and regain the unworthy little animal. But he was evidently afraid Sara might think he was taking a great liberty and perhaps would not let him come.

But Sara gave him leave at once.

" Can you get across? " she inquired.

" In a moment, " he answered her.

" Then come, " she said; " He is flying from side to side of the room as if he was frightened. "

Ram Dass slipped through his attic window and crossed to hers as steadily and lightly as if he had walked on roofs all his life. He slipped through the skylight and dropped upon his feet without a sound. Then he turned to Sara and salaamed again. The monkey saw him and uttered a little scream. Ram Dass hastily took the precaution of shutting the skylight, and then went in chase of him. It was not a very long chase. The monkey prolonged it a few minutes evidently for the mere fun of it, but presently he sprang chattering on to Ram Dass's shoulder and sat there chattering and clinging to his neck with a weird little skinny arm.

Ram Dass thanked Sara profoundly. She had seen that his quick native eyes had taken in at a glance all the bare shabbiness of the room, but he spoke to her as if he were speaking to the little daughter of a rajah, and pretended that he observed nothing. He did not presume to remain more than a few moments after he had caught the monkey, and those moments were given to further deep and grateful obeisance to her in return for her indulgence. This little evil one, he said, stroking the monkey, was, in truth, not so evil as he seemed, and his master, who was ill, was sometimes amused by him. He would have been made sad if his favorite had run away and been lost. Then he salaamed once more and got through the skylight and across the slates again with as much agility as the monkey himself had displayed.

When he had gone Sara stood in the middle of her attic and thought of many things his face and his manner had brought back to her. The sight of his native costume and the profound reverence of his manner stirred all her past memories. It seemed a strange thing to remember that she - the drudge whom the cook had said insulting things to an hour ago - had only a few years ago been surrounded by people who all treated her as Ram Dass had treated her; who salaamed when she went by, whose foreheads almost touched the ground when she spoke to them, who were her servants and her slaves. It was like a sort of dream. It was all over, and it could never come back. It certainly seemed that there was no way in which any change could take place. She knew what Miss Minchin intended that her future should be. So long as she was too young to be used as a regular teacher, she would be used as an errand girl and servant and yet expected to remember what she had learned and in some mysterious way to learn more. The greater number of her evenings she was supposed to spend at study, and at various indefinite intervals she was examined and knew she would have been severely admonished if she had not advanced as was expected of her. The truth, indeed, was that Miss Minchin knew that she was too anxious to learn to require teachers. Give her books, and she would devour them and end by knowing them by heart. She might be trusted to be equal to teaching a good deal in the course of a few years. This was what would happen: when she was older she would be expected to drudge in the schoolroom as she drudged now in various parts of the house; they would be obliged to give her more respectable clothes, but they would be sure to be plain and ugly and to make her look somehow like a servant. That was all there seemed to be to look forward to, and Sara stood quite still for several minutes and thought it over.

Then a thought came back to her which made the color rise in her cheek and a spark light itself in her eyes. She straightened her thin little body and lifted her head.

" Whatever comes, " she said, " Cannot alter one thing. If I am a princess in rags and tatters, I can be a princess inside. It would be easy to be a princess if I were dressed in cloth of gold, but it is a great deal more of a triumph to be one all the time when no one knows it. There was Marie Antoinette when she was in prison and her throne was gone and she had only a black gown on, and her hair was white, and they insulted her and called her Widow Capet. She was a great deal more like a queen then than when she was so gay and everything was so grand. I like her best then. Those howling mobs of people did not frighten her. She was stronger than they were, even when they cut her head off. "

This was not a new thought, but quite an old one, by this time. It had consoled her through many a bitter day, and she had gone about the house with an expression in her face which Miss Minchin could not understand and which was a source of great annoyance to her, as it seemed as if the child were mentally living a life which held her above the rest of the world. It was as if she scarcely heard the rude and acid things said to her; or, if she heard them, did not care for them at all. Sometimes, when she was in the midst of some harsh, domineering speech, Miss Minchin would find the still, unchildish eyes fixed upon her with something like a proud smile in them. At such times she did not know that Sara was saying to herself:

" You don' t know that you are saying these things to a princess, and that if I chose I could wave my hand and order you to execution. I only spare you because I am a princess, and you are a poor, stupid, unkind, vulgar old thing, and don' t know any better. "

This used to interest and amuse her more than anything else; and queer and fanciful as it was, she found comfort in it and it was a good thing for her. While the thought held possession of her, she could not be made rude and malicious by the rudeness and malice of those about her.

" A princess must be polite, " she said to herself.

And so when the servants, taking their tone from their mistress, were insolent and ordered her about, she would hold her head erect and reply to them with a quaint civility which often made them stare at her.

" She's got more airs and graces than if she come from Buckingham Palace, that young one, " said the cook, chuckling a little sometimes; " I lose my temper with her often enough, but I will say she never forgets her manners. ' If you please, cook' ; ' Will you be so kind, cook? ' ' I beg your pardon, cook' ; ' May I trouble you, cook? 'she drops' em about the kitchen as if they was nothing. "

The morning after the interview with Ram Dass and his monkey, Sara was in the schoolroom with her small pupils. Having finished giving them their lessons, she was putting the French exercise - books together and thinking, as she did it, of the various things royal personages in disguise were called upon to do: Alfred the Great, for instance, burning the cakes and getting his ears boxed by the wife of the neat - herd. How frightened she must have been when she found out what she had done. If Miss Minchin should find out that she - Sara, whose toes were almost sticking out of her boots - was a princess - a real one! The look in her eyes was exactly the look which Miss Minchin most disliked. She would not have it; she was quite near her and was so enraged that she actually flew at her and boxed her ears - exactly as the neatherd's wife had boxed King Alfred's. It made Sara start. She wakened from her dream at the shock, and, catching her breath, stood still a second. Then, not knowing she was going to do it, she broke into a little laugh.

" What are you laughing at, you bold, impudent child? " Miss Minchin exclaimed.

It took Sara a few seconds to control herself sufficiently to remember that she was a princess. Her cheeks were red and smarting from the blows she had received.

" I was thinking, " she answered.

" Beg my pardon immediately, " said Miss Minchin.

Sara hesitated a second before she replied.

" I will beg your pardon for laughing, if it was rude, " she said then; " But I won' t beg your pardon for thinking. "

" What were you thinking? " demanded Miss Minchin. " How dare you think? What were you thinking? "

Jessie tittered, and she and Lavinia nudged each other in unison. All the girls looked up from their books to listen. Really, it always interested them a little when Miss Minchin attacked Sara. Sara always said something queer, and never seemed the least bit frightened. She was not in the least frightened now, though her boxed ears were scarlet and her eyes were as bright as stars.

" I was thinking, " she answered grandly and politely, " that you did not know what you were doing. "

" That I did not know what I was doing? " Miss Minchin fairly gasped.

Yes, " said Sara, " and I was thinking what would happen if I were a princess and you boxed my ears - what I should do to you. And I was thinking that if I were one, you would never dare to do it, whatever I said or did. And I was thinking how surprised and frightened you would be if you suddenly found out - "

She had the imagined future so clearly before her eyes that she spoke in a manner which had an effect even upon Miss Minchin. It almost seemed for the moment to her narrow, unimaginative mind that there must be some real power hidden behind this candid daring.

" What? " she exclaimed. " Found out what? "

" That I really was a princess, " said Sara, " And could do anything - anything I liked. "

Every pair of eyes in the room widened to its full limit. Lavinia leaned forward on her seat to look.

" Go to your room, " cried Miss Minchin, breathlessly, " this instant! Leave the schoolroom! Attend to your lessons, young ladies! "

Sara made a little bow.

" Excuse me for laughing if it was impolite, " she said, and walked out of the room, leaving Miss Minchin struggling with her rage, and the girls whispering over their books.

" Did you see her? Did you see how queer she looked? " Jessie broke out. " I shouldn' t be at all surprised if she did turn out to be something. Suppose she should! "





CHAPTER Ⅻ　THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL


WHEN one lives in a row of houses, it is interesting to think of the things which are being done and said on the other side of the wall of the very rooms one is living in. Sara was fond of amusing herself by trying to imagine the things hidden by the wall which divided the Select Seminary from the Indian gentleman's house. She knew that the schoolroom was next to the Indian gentleman's study, and she hoped that the wall was thick so that the noise made sometimes after lesson hours would not disturb him.

" I am growing quite fond of him, " she said to Ermengarde; " I should not like him to be disturbed. I have adopted him for a friend. You can do that with people you never speak to at all. You can just watch them, and think about them and be sorry for them, until they seem almost like relations. I' m quite anxious sometimes when I see the doctor call twice a day. "

" I have very few relations, " said Ermengarde, reflectively, " And I' m very glad of it. I don' t like those I have. My two aunts are always saying, ' Dear me, Ermengarde! You are very fat. You shouldn' t eat sweets, ' and my uncle is always asking me things like, ' When did Edward the Third ascend the throne? ' and, ' Who died of a surfeit of lampreys? ' "

Sara laughed.

" People you never speak to can' t ask you questions like that, " she said; " and I' m sure the Indian gentleman wouldn' t even if he was quite intimate with you. I am fond of him. "

She had become fond of the Large Family because they looked happy; but she had become fond of the Indian gentleman because he looked unhappy. He had evidently not fully recovered from some very severe illness. In the kitchen - where, of course, the servants, through some mysterious means, knew everything - there was much discussion of his case. He was not an Indian gentleman really, but an Englishman who had lived in India. He had met with great misfortunes which had for a time so imperilled his whole fortune that he had thought himself ruined and disgraced forever. The shock had been so great that he had almost died of brain - fever; and ever since he had been shattered in health, though his fortunes had changed and all his possessions had been restored to him. His trouble and peril had been connected with mines.

" And mines with diamonds in' em! " said the cook.

" No savin's of mine never goes into no mines - particular diamond ones " - with a side glance at Sara. " We all know somethin' of THEM. "

" He felt as my papa felt, " Sara thought. " He was ill as my papa was; but he did not die. "

So her heart was more drawn to him than before. When she was sent out at night she used sometimes to feel quite glad, because there was always a chance that the curtains of the house next door might not yet be closed and she could look into the warm room and see her adopted friend. When no one was about she used sometimes to stop, and, holding to the iron railings, wish him good night as if he could hear her.

" Perhaps you can FEEL if you can' t hear, " was her fancy. " Perhaps kind thoughts reach people somehow, even through windows and doors and walls. Perhaps you feel a little warm and comforted, and don' t know why, when I am standing here in the cold and hoping you will get well and happy again. I am so sorry for you, " she would whisper in an intense little voice. " I wish you had a' Little Missus' who could pet you as I used to pet papa when he had a headache. I should like to be your' Little Missus' myself, poor dear! Good night - good night. God bless you! "

She would go away, feeling quite comforted and a little warmer herself. Her sympathy was so strong that it seemed as if it MUST reach him somehow as he sat alone in his armchair by the fire, nearly always in a great dressing - gown, and nearly always with his forehead resting in his hand as he gazed hopelessly into the fire. He looked to Sara like a man who had a trouble on his mind still, not merely like one whose troubles lay all in the past.

" He always seems as if he were thinking of something that hurts him NOW, " she said to herself; " But he has got his money back and he will get over his brain - fever in time, so he ought not to look like that. I wonder if there is something else. "

If there was something else - something even servants did not hear of - she could not help believing that the father of the Large Family knew it - the gentleman she called Mr. Montmorency. Mr. Montmorency went to see him often, and Mrs. Montmorency and all the little Montmorencys went, too, though less often. He seemed particularly fond of the two elder little girls - the Janet and Nora who had been so alarmed when their small brother Donald had given Sara his sixpence. He had, in fact, a very tender place in his heart for all children, and particularly for little girls. Janet and Nora were as fond of him as he was of them, and looked forward with the greatest pleasure to the afternoons when they were allowed to cross the square and make their well - behaved little visits to him. They were extremely decorous little visits because he was an invalid.

" He is a poor thing, " said Janet, " And he says we cheer him up. We try to cheer him up very quietly. "

Janet was the head of the family, and kept the rest of it in order. It was she who decided when it was discreet to ask the Indian gentleman to tell stories about India, and it was she who saw when he was tired and it was the time to steal quietly away and tell Ram Dass to go to him. They were very fond of Ram Dass. He could have told any number of stories if he had been able to speak anything but Hindustani. The Indian gentleman's real name was Mr. Carrisford, and Janet told Mr. Carrisford about the encounter with the little - girl - who - was - not - a - beggar. He was very much interested, and all the more so when he heard from Ram Dass of the adventure of the monkey on the roof. Ram Dass made for him a very clear picture of the attic and its desolateness - of the bare floor and broken plaster, the rusty, empty grate, and the hard, narrow bed.

" Carmichael, " he said to the father of the Large Family, after he had heard this description; " I wonder how many of the attics in this square are like that one, and how many wretched little servant girls sleep on such beds, while I toss on my down pillows, loaded and harassed by wealth that is, most of it - not mine. "

" My dear fellow, " Mr. Carmichael answered cheerily, " the sooner you cease tormenting yourself the better it will be for you. If you possessed all the wealth of all the Indies, you could not set right all the discomforts in the world, and if you began to refurnish all the attics in this square, there would still remain all the attics in all the other squares and streets to put in order. And there you are! "

Mr. Carrisford sat and bit his nails as he looked into the glowing bed of coals in the grate.

" Do you suppose, " he said slowly, after a pause - " Do you think it is possible that the other child - the child I never cease thinking of, I believe - could be - could POSSIBLY be reduced to any such condition as the poor little soul next door? "

Mr. Carmichael looked at him uneasily. He knew that the worst thing the man could do for himself, for his reason and his health, was to begin to think in this particular way of this particular subject.

" If the child at Madame Pascal's school in Paris was the one you are in search of, " he answered soothingly, " She would seem to be in the hands of people who can afford to take care of her. They adopted her because she had been the favorite companion of their little daughter who died. They had no other children, and Madame Pascal said that they were extremely well - to - do Russians. "

" And the wretched woman actually did not know where they had taken her! " exclaimed Mr. Carrisford.

Mr. Carmichael shrugged his shoulders.

" She was a shrewd, worldly Frenchwoman, and was evidently only too glad to get the child so comfortably off her hands when the father's death left her totally unprovided for. Women of her type do not trouble themselves about the futures of children who might prove burdens. The adopted parents apparently disappeared and left no trace. "

" But you say' IF' the child was the one I am in search of. You say' if. ' We are not sure. There was a difference in the name. "

" Madame Pascal pronounced it as if it were Carew instead of Crewe - but that might be merely a matter of pronunciation. The circumstances were curiously similar. An English officer in India had placed his motherless little girl at the school. He had died suddenly after losing his fortune. " Mr. Carmichael paused a moment, as if a new thought had occurred to him. " Are you SURE the child was left at a school in Paris? Are you sure it was Paris? "

" My dear fellow, " broke forth Carrisford, with restless bitterness, " I am SURE of nothing. I never saw either the child or her mother. Ralph Crewe and I loved each other as boys, but we had not met since our school - days, until we met in India. I was absorbed in the magnificent promise of the mines. He became absorbed, too. The whole thing was so huge and glittering that we half lost our heads. When we met we scarcely spoke of anything else. I only knew that the child had been sent to school somewhere. I do not even remember, now, HOW I knew it. "

He was beginning to be excited. He always became excited when his still weakened brain was stirred by memories of the catastrophes of the past.

Mr. Carmichael watched him anxiously. It was necessary to ask some questions, but they must be put quietly and with caution.

" But you had reason to think the school WAS in Paris? "

" Yes, " was the answer, " Because her mother was a Frenchwoman, and I had heard that she wished her child to be educated in Paris. It seemed only likely that she would be there. "

" Yes, " Mr. Carmichael said, " It seems more than probable. "

The Indian gentleman leaned forward and struck the table with a long, wasted hand.

" Carmichael, " he said, " I MUST find her. If she is alive, she is somewhere. If she is friendless and penniless, it is through my fault. How is a man to get back his nerve with a thing like that on his mind? This sudden change of luck at the mines has made realities of all our most fantastic dreams, and poor Crewe's child may be begging in the street! "

" No, no, " said Carmichael. " Try to be calm. Console yourself with the fact that when she is found you have a fortune to hand over to her. "

" Why was I not man enough to stand my ground when things looked black? " Carrisford groaned in petulant misery. " I believe I should have stood my ground if I had not been responsible for other people's money as well as my own. Poor Crewe had put into the scheme every penny that he owned. He trusted me - he LOVED me. And he died thinking I had ruined him - I - Tom Carrisford, who played cricket at Eton with him. What a villain he must have thought me! "

" Don' t reproach yourself so bitterly. "

" I don' t reproach myself because the speculation threatened to fail - I reproach myself for losing my courage. I ran away like a swindler and a thief, because I could not face my best friend and tell him I had ruined him and his child. "

The good - hearted father of the Large Family put his hand on his shoulder comfortingly.

" You ran away because your brain had given way under the strain of mental torture, " he said. " You were half delirious already. If you had not been you would have stayed and fought it out. You were in a hospital, strapped down in bed, raving with brain - fever, two days after you left the place. Remember that. "

Carrisford dropped his forehead in his hands.

" Good God! Yes, " he said. " I was driven mad with dread and horror. I had not slept for weeks. The night I staggered out of my house all the air seemed full of hideous things mocking and mouthing at me. "

" That is explanation enough in itself, " said Mr. Carmichael. " How could a man on the verge of brain - fever judge sanely! "

Carrisford shook his drooping head.

" And when I returned to consciousness poor Crewe was dead - and buried. And I seemed to remember nothing. I did not remember the child for months and months. Even when I began to recall her existence everything seemed in a sort of haze. "

He stopped a moment and rubbed his forehead. " It sometimes seems so now when I try to remember. Surely I must sometime have heard Crewe speak of the school she was sent to. Don' t you think so? "

" He might not have spoken of it definitely. You never seem even to have heard her real name. "

" He used to call her by an odd pet name he had invented. He called her his' Little Missus. ' But the wretched mines drove everything else out of our heads. We talked of nothing else. If he spoke of the school, I forgot - I forgot. And now I shall never remember. "

" Come, come, " said Carmichael. " We shall find her yet. We will continue to search for Madame Pascal's good - natured Russians. She seemed to have a vague idea that they lived in Moscow. We will take that as a clue. I will go to Moscow. "

" If I were able to travel, I would go with you, " said Carrisford; " But I can only sit here wrapped in furs and stare at the fire. And when I look into it I seem to see Crewe's gay young face gazing back at me. He looks as if he were asking me a question. Sometimes I dream of him at night, and he always stands before me and asks the same question in words. Can you guess what he says, Carmichael? "

Mr. Carmichael answered him in a rather low voice. " Not exactly, " he said.

" He always says, ' Tom, old man - Tom - where is the Little Missus? ' " He caught at Carmichael's hand and clung to it. " I must be able to answer him - I must! " he said. " Help me to find her. Help me. "

On the other side of the wall Sara was sitting in her garret talking to Melchisedec, who had come out for his evening meal.

" It has been hard to be a princess today, Melchisedec, " she said. " It has been harder than usual. It gets harder as the weather grows colder and the streets get more sloppy. When Lavinia laughed at my muddy skirt as I passed her in the hall, I thought of something to say all in a flash - and I only just stopped myself in time. You can' t sneer back at people like that - if you are a princess. But you have to bite your tongue to hold yourself in. I bit mine. It was a cold afternoon, Melchisedec. And it's a cold night. "

Quite suddenly she put her black head down in her arms, as she often did when she was alone.

" Oh, papa, " she whispered, " What a long time it seems since I was your' Little Missus' ! "

This was what happened that day on both sides of the wall.





CHAPTER ⅩⅢ　ONE OF THE POPULACE


THE winter was a wretched one. There were days on which Sara tramped through snow when she went on her errands; there were worse days when the snow melted and combined itself with mud to form slush; there were others when the fog was so thick that the lamps in the street were lighted all day and London looked as it had looked the afternoon, several years ago, when the cab had driven through the thoroughfares with Sara tucked up on its seat, leaning against her father's shoulder. On such days the windows of the house of the Large Family always looked delightfully cozy and alluring, and the study in which the Indian gentleman sat glowed with warmth and rich color. But the attic was dismal beyond words. There were no longer sunsets or sunrises to look at, and scarcely ever any stars, it seemed to Sara. The clouds hung low over the skylight and were either gray or mud - color, or dropping heavy rain. At four o' clock in the afternoon, even when there was no special fog, the daylight was at an end. If it was necessary to go to her attic for anything, Sara was obliged to light a candle. The women in the kitchen were depressed, and that made them more ill - tempered than ever. Becky was driven like a little slave.

" ' Twarn' t for you, miss, " she said hoarsely to Sara one night when she had crept into the attic - " ' Twarn' t for you, an' the Bastille, an' bein' the prisoner in the next cell, I should die. That there does seem real now, doesn' t it? The missus is more like the head jailer every day she lives. I can jest see them big keys you say she carries. The cook she's like one of the under - jailers. Tell me some more, please, miss - tell me about the subt' ranean passage we' ve dug under the walls. "

" I' ll tell you something warmer, " shivered Sara. " Get your coverlet and wrap it round you, and I' ll get mine, and we will huddle close together on the bed, and I' ll tell you about the tropical forest where the Indian gentleman's monkey used to live. When I see him sitting on the table near the window and looking out into the street with that mournful expression, I always feel sure he is thinking about the tropical forest where he used to swing by his tail from coconut - trees. I wonder who caught him, and if he left a family behind who had depended on him for coconuts. "

" That is warmer, miss, " said Becky, gratefully; " But, someways, even the Bastille is sort of heatin' when you gets to tellin' about it. "

" That is because it makes you think of something else, " said Sara, wrapping the coverlet round her until only her small dark face was to be seen looking out of it. " I' ve noticed this. What you have to do with your mind, when your body is miserable, is to make it think of something else. "

" Can you do it, miss? " faltered Becky, regarding her with admiring eyes.

Sara knitted her brows a moment.

" Sometimes I can and sometimes I can' t, " she said stoutly. " But when I CAN I' m all right. And what I believe is that we always could - if we practised enough. I' ve been practising a good deal lately, and it's beginning to be easier than it used to be. When things are horrible - just horrible - I think as hard as ever I can of being a princess. I say to myself, ' I am a princess, and I am a fairy one, and because I am a fairy nothing can hurt me or make me uncomfortable. ' You don' t know how it makes you forget " - with a laugh.

She had many opportunities of making her mind think of something else, and many opportunities of proving to herself whether or not she was a princess. But one of the strongest tests she was ever put to came on a certain dreadful day which, she often thought afterward, would never quite fade out of her memory even in the years to come.

For several days it had rained continuously; the streets were chilly and sloppy and full of dreary, cold mist; there was mud everywhere - sticky London mud - and over everything the pall of drizzle and fog. Of course there were several long and tiresome errands to be done - there always were on days like this - and Sara was sent out again and again, until her shabby clothes were damp through. The absurd old feathers on her forlorn hat were more draggled and absurd than ever, and her downtrodden shoes were so wet that they could not hold any more water. Added to this, she had been deprived of her dinner, because Miss Minchin had chosen to punish her. She was so cold and hungry and tired that her face began to have a pinched look, and now and then some kind - hearted person passing her in the street glanced at her with sudden sympathy. But she did not know that. She hurried on, trying to make her mind think of something else. It was really very necessary. Her way of doing it was to " Pretend " and " Suppose " with all the strength that was left in her. But really this time it was harder than she had ever found it, and once or twice she thought it almost made her more cold and hungry instead of less so. But she persevered obstinately, and as the muddy water squelched through her broken shoes and the wind seemed trying to drag her thin jacket from her, she talked to herself as she walked, though she did not speak aloud or even move her lips.

" Suppose I had dry clothes on, " she thought. " Suppose I had good shoes and a long, thick coat and merino stockings and a whole umbrella. And suppose - suppose - just when I was near a baker's where they sold hot buns, I should find sixpence - which belonged to nobody. SUPPOSE, if I did, I should go into the shop and buy six of the hottest buns and eat them all without stopping. "

Some very odd things happen in this world sometimes.

It certainly was an odd thing that happened to Sara. She had to cross the street just when she was saying this to herself. The mud was dreadful - she almost had to wade. She picked her way as carefully as she could, but she could not save herself much; only, in picking her way, she had to look down at her feet and the mud, and in looking down - just as she reached the pavement - she saw something shining in the gutter. It was actually a piece of silver - a tiny piece trodden upon by many feet, but still with spirit enough left to shine a little. Not quite a sixpence, but the next thing to it - a fourpenny piece.

In one second it was in her cold little red - and - blue hand.

" Oh, " she gasped, " It is true! It is true! "

And then, if you will believe me, she looked straight at the shop directly facing her. And it was a baker's shop, and a cheerful, stout, motherly woman with rosy cheeks was putting into the window a tray of delicious newly baked hot buns, fresh from the oven - large, plump, shiny buns, with currants in them.

It almost made Sara feel faint for a few seconds - the shock, and the sight of the buns, and the delightful odors of warm bread floating up through the baker's cellar window.

She knew she need not hesitate to use the little piece of money. It had evidently been lying in the mud for some time, and its owner was completely lost in the stream of passing people who crowded and jostled each other all day long.

" But I' ll go and ask the baker woman if she has lost anything, " she said to herself, rather faintly. So she crossed the pavement and put her wet foot on the step. As she did so she saw something that made her stop.

It was a little figure more forlorn even than herself - a little figure which was not much more than a bundle of rags, from which small, bare, red muddy feet peeped out, only because the rags with which their owner was trying to cover them were not long enough. Above the rags appeared a shock head of tangled hair, and a dirty face with big, hollow, hungry eyes.

Sara knew they were hungry eyes the moment she saw them, and she felt a sudden sympathy.

" This, " she said to herself, with a little sigh, " is one of the populace - and she is hungrier than I am. "

The child - this " One of the populace " - stared up at Sara, and shuffled herself aside a little, so as to give her room to pass. She was used to being made to give room to everybody. She knew that if a policeman chanced to see her he would tell her to " Move on. "

Sara clutched her little fourpenny piece and hesitated a few seconds. Then she spoke to her.

" Are you hungry? " she asked.

The child shuffled herself and her rags a little more.

" Ain' t I jist? " she said in a hoarse voice. " Jist ain' t I? "

" Haven' t you had any dinner? " said Sara.

" No dinner, " - more hoarsely still and with more shuffling. " Nor yet no bre' fast - nor yet no supper. No nothin' . "

" Since when? " asked Sara.

" Dunno. Never got nothin' today - nowhere. I' ve axed an' axed. "

Just to look at her made Sara more hungry and faint. But those queer little thoughts were at work in her brain, and she was talking to herself, though she was sick at heart.

" If I' m a princess, " she was saying, " If I' m a princess - when they were poor and driven from their thrones - they always shared - with the populace - if they met one poorer and hungrier than themselves. They always shared. Buns are a penny each. If it had been sixpence I could have eaten six. It won' t be enough for either of us. But it will be better than nothing. "

" Wait a minute, " she said to the beggar child.

She went into the shop. It was warm and smelled deliciously. The woman was just going to put some more hot buns into the window.

" If you please, " said Sara, " Have you lost fourpence - a silver fourpence? " And she held the forlorn little piece of money out to her.

The woman looked at it and then at her - at her intense little face and draggled, once fine clothes.

" Bless us! no, " she answered. " Did you find it? "

" Yes, " said Sara. " In the gutter. "

" Keep it, then, " said the woman. " It may have been there for a week, and goodness knows who lost it. YOU could never find out. "

" I know that, " said Sara, " But I thought I would ask you. "

" Not many would, " said the woman, looking puzzled and interested and good - natured all at once.

" Do you want to buy something? " she added, as she saw Sara glance at the buns.

" Four buns, if you please, " said Sara. " Those at a penny each. "

The woman went to the window and put some in a paper bag.

Sara noticed that she put in six.

" I said four, if you please, " she explained. " I have only four pence. "

" I' ll throw in two for makeweight, " said the woman, with her good - natured look. " I dare say you can eat them sometime. Aren' t you hungry? "

A mist rose before Sara's eyes.

" Yes, " she answered. " I am very hungry, and I am much obliged to you for your kindness; and " - she was going to add - " There is a child outside who is hungrier than I am. " But just at that moment two or three customers came in at once, and each one seemed in a hurry, so she could only thank the woman again and go out.

The beggar girl was still huddled up in the corner of the step. She looked frightful in her wet and dirty rags. She was staring straight before her with a stupid look of suffering, and Sara saw her suddenly draw the back of her roughened black hand across her eyes to rub away the tears which seemed to have surprised her by forcing their way from under her lids. She was muttering to herself.

Sara opened the paper bag and took out one of the hot buns, which had already warmed her own cold hands a little.

" See, " she said, putting the bun in the ragged lap, " This is nice and hot. Eat it, and you will not feel so hungry. "

The child started and stared up at her, as if such sudden, amazing good luck almost frightened her; then she snatched up the bun and began to cram it into her mouth with great wolfish bites.

" Oh, my! Oh, my! " Sara heard her say hoarsely, in wild delight. " OH, my! "

Sara took out three more buns and put them down.

The sound in the hoarse, ravenous voice was awful.

" She is hungrier than I am, " she said to herself. " She's starving. " But her hand trembled when she put down the fourth bun. " I' m not starving, " she said - and she put down the fifth.

The little ravening London savage was still snatching and devouring when she turned away. She was too ravenous to give any thanks, even if she had ever been taught politeness - which she had not. She was only a poor little wild animal.

" Good - bye, " said Sara.

When she reached the other side of the street she looked back. The child had a bun in each hand and had stopped in the middle of a bite to watch her. Sara gave her a little nod, and the child, after another stare - a curious lingering stare - jerked her shaggy head in response, and until Sara was out of sight she did not take another bite or even finish the one she had begun.

At that moment the baker - woman looked out of her shop window.

" Well, I never! " she exclaimed. " If that young un hasn' t given her buns to a beggar child! It wasn' t because she didn' t want them, either. Well, well, she looked hungry enough. I' d give something to know what she did it for. "

She stood behind her window for a few moments and pondered. Then her curiosity got the better of her. She went to the door and spoke to the beggar child.

" Who gave you those buns? " she asked her.

The child nodded her head toward Sara's vanishing figure.

" What did she say? " inquired the woman.

" Axed me if I was' ungry, " replied the hoarse voice.

" What did you say? "

" Said I was jist. "

" And then she came in and got the buns, and gave them to you, did she? "

The child nodded.

" How many? "

" Five. "

The woman thought it over.

" Left just one for herself, " she said in a low voice. " And she could have eaten the whole six - I saw it in her eyes. "

She looked after the little draggled far - away figure and felt more disturbed in her usually comfortable mind than she had felt for many a day.

" I wish she hadn' t gone so quick, " she said. " I' m blest if she shouldn' t have had a dozen. " Then she turned to the child.

" Are you hungry yet? " she said.

" I' m allus hungry, " was the answer, " But' t ain' t as bad as it was. "

" Come in here, " said the woman, and she held open the shop door.

The child got up and shuffled in. To be invited into a warm place full of bread seemed an incredible thing. She did not know what was going to happen. She did not care, even.

" Get yourself warm, " said the woman, pointing to a fire in the tiny back room. " And look here; when you are hard up for a bit of bread, you can come in here and ask for it. I' m blest if I won' t give it to you for that young one's sake. "

Sara found some comfort in her remaining bun. At all events, it was very hot, and it was better than nothing. As she walked along she broke off small pieces and ate them slowly to make them last longer.

" Suppose it was a magic bun, " she said, " and a bite was as much as a whole dinner. I should be overeating myself if I went on like this. "

It was dark when she reached the square where the Select Seminary was situated. The lights in the houses were all lighted. The blinds were not yet drawn in the windows of the room where she nearly always caught glimpses of members of the Large Family. Frequently at this hour she could see the gentleman she called Mr. Montmorency sitting in a big chair, with a small swarm round him, talking, laughing, perching on the arms of his seat or on his knees or leaning against them. This evening the swarm was about him, but he was not seated. On the contrary, there was a good deal of excitement going on. It was evident that a journey was to be taken, and it was Mr. Montmorency who was to take it. A brougham stood before the door, and a big portmanteau had been strapped upon it. The children were dancing about, chattering and hanging on to their father. The pretty rosy mother was standing near him, talking as if she was asking final questions. Sara paused a moment to see the little ones lifted up and kissed and the bigger ones bent over and kissed also.

" I wonder if he will stay away long, " she thought. " The portmanteau is rather big. Oh, dear, how they will miss him! I shall miss him myself - even though he doesn' t know I am alive. "

When the door opened she moved away - remembering the sixpence - but she saw the traveller come out and stand against the background of the warmly - lighted hall, the older children still hovering about him.

" Will Moscow be covered with snow? " said the little girl Janet. " Will there be ice everywhere? "

" Shall you drive in a drosky? " cried another. " Shall you see the Czar? "

" I will write and tell you all about it, " he answered, laughing. " And I will send you pictures of muzhiks and things. Run into the house. It is a hideous damp night. I would rather stay with you than go to Moscow. Good night! Good night, duckies! God bless you! " And he ran down the steps and jumped into the brougham.

" If you find the little girl, give her our love, " shouted Guy Clarence, jumping up and down on the door - mat.

Then they went in and shut the door.

" Did you see, " said Janet to Nora, as they went back to the room - " The little - girl - who - is - not - a - beggar was passing? She looked all cold and wet, and I saw her turn her head over her shoulder and look at us. Mamma says her clothes always look as if they had been given her by someone who was quite rich - someone who only let her have them because they were too shabby to wear. The people at the school always send her out on errands on the horridest days and nights there are. "

Sara crossed the square to Miss Minchin's area steps, feeling faint and shaky.

" I wonder who the little girl is, " she thought - " The little girl he is going to look for. "

And she went down the area steps, lugging her basket and finding it very heavy indeed, as the father of the Large Family drove quickly on his way to the station to take the train which was to carry him to Moscow, where he was to make his best efforts to search for the lost little daughter of Captain Crewe.





CHAPTER ⅩⅣ　WHAT MELCHISEDEC HEARD AND SAW


ON this very afternoon, while Sara was out, a strange thing happened in the attic. Only Melchisedec saw and heard it; and he was so much alarmed and mystified that he scuttled back to his hole and hid there, and really quaked and trembled as he peeped out furtively and with great caution to watch what was going on.

The attic had been very still all the day after Sara had left it in the early morning. The stillness had only been broken by the pattering of the rain upon the slates and the skylight. Melchisedec had, in fact, found it rather dull; and when the rain ceased to patter and perfect silence reigned, he decided to come out and reconnoitre, though experience taught him that Sara would not return for some time. He had been rambling and sniffing about, and had just found a totally unexpected and unexplained crumb left from his last meal, when his attention was attracted by a sound on the roof. He stopped to listen with a palpitating heart. The sound suggested that something was moving on the roof. It was approaching the skylight; it reached the skylight. The skylight was being mysteriously opened. A dark face peered into the attic; then another face appeared behind it, and both looked in with signs of caution and interest. Two men were outside on the roof, and were making silent preparations to enter through the skylight itself. One was Ram Dass, and the other was a young man who was the Indian gentleman's secretary; but of course Melchisedec did not know this. He only knew that the men were invading the silence and privacy of the attic; and as the one with the dark face let himself down through the aperture with such lightness and dexterity that he did not make the slightest sound, Melchisedec turned tail and fled precipitately back to his hole. He was frightened to death. He had ceased to be timid with Sara, and knew she would never throw anything but crumbs, and would never make any sound other than the soft, low, coaxing whistling; but strange men were dangerous things to remain near. He lay close and flat near the entrance of his home, just managing to peep through the crack with a bright, alarmed eye. How much he understood of the talk he heard I am not in the least able to say; but, even if he had understood it all, he would probably have remained greatly mystified.

The secretary, who was light and young, slipped through the skylight as noiselessly as Ram Dass had done; and he caught a last glimpse of Melchisedec's vanishing tail.

" Was that a rat? " he asked Ram Dass in a whisper.

" Yes; a rat, Sahib, " answered Ram Dass, also whispering. " There are many in the walls. "

" Ugh! " exclaimed the young man; " It is a wonder the child is not terrified of them. "

Ram Dass made a gesture with his hands. He also smiled respectfully. He was in this place as the intimate exponent of Sara, though she had only spoken to him once.

" The child is the little friend of all things, Sahib, " he answered. " She is not as other children. I see her when she does not see me. I slip across the slates and look at her many nights to see that she is safe. I watch her from my window when she does not know I am near. She stands on the table there and looks out at the sky as if it spoke to her. The sparrows come at her call. The rat she has fed and tamed in her loneliness. The poor slave of the house comes to her for comfort. There is a little child who comes to her in secret; there is one older who worships her and would listen to her forever if she might. This I have seen when I have crept across the roof. By the mistress of the house - who is an evil woman - she is treated like a pariah; but she has the bearing of a child who is of the blood of kings! "

" You seem to know a great deal about her, " the secretary said.

" All her life each day I know, " answered Ram Dass. " Her going out I know, and her coming in; her sadness and her poor joys; her coldness and her hunger. I know when she sits alone until midnight, learning from her books; I know when her secret friends steal to her and she is happier - as children can be, even in the midst of poverty - because they come and she may laugh and talk with them in whispers. If she were ill I should know, and I would come and serve her if it might be done. "

" You are sure no one comes near this place but herself, and that she will not return and surprise us. She would be frightened if she found us here, and the Sahib Carrisford's plan would be spoiled. "

Ram Dass crossed noiselessly to the door and stood close to it.

" None mount here but herself, Sahib, " he said. " She has gone out with her basket and may be gone for hours. If I stand here I can hear any step before it reaches the last flight of the stairs. "

The secretary took a pencil and a tablet from his breast pocket.

" Keep your ears open, " he said; and he began to walk slowly and softly round the miserable little room, making rapid notes on his tablet as he looked at things.

First he went to the narrow bed. He pressed his hand upon the mattress and uttered an exclamation.

" As hard as a stone, " he said. " That will have to be altered some day when she is out. A special journey can be made to bring it across. It cannot be done tonight. " He lifted the covering and examined the one thin pillow.

" Coverlet dingy and worn, blanket thin, sheets patched and ragged, " he said. " What a bed for a child to sleep in - and in a house which calls itself respectable! There has not been a fire in that grate for many a day, " glancing at the rusty fireplace.

" Never since I have seen it, " said Ram Dass. " The mistress of the house is not one who remembers that another than herself may be cold. "

The secretary was writing quickly on his tablet. He looked up from it as he tore off a leaf and slipped it into his breast pocket.

" It is a strange way of doing the thing, " he said. " Who planned it? "

Ram Dass made a modestly apologetic obeisance.

" It is true that the first thought was mine, Sahib, " he said; " though it was naught but a fancy. I am fond of this child; we are both lonely. It is her way to relate her visions to her secret friends. Being sad one night, I lay close to the open skylight and listened. The vision she related told what this miserable room might be if it had comforts in it. She seemed to see it as she talked, and she grew cheered and warmed as she spoke. Then she came to this fancy; and the next day, the Sahib being ill and wretched, I told him of the thing to amuse him. It seemed then but a dream, but it pleased the Sahib. To hear of the child's doings gave him entertainment. He became interested in her and asked questions. At last he began to please himself with the thought of making her visions real things. "

" You think that it can be done while she sleeps? Suppose she awakened, " suggested the secretary; and it was evident that whatsoever the plan referred to was, it had caught and pleased his fancy as well as the Sahib Carrisford's.

" I can move as if my feet were of velvet, " Ram Dass replied; " and children sleep soundly - even the unhappy ones. I could have entered this room in the night many times, and without causing her to turn upon her pillow. If the other bearer passes to me the things through the window, I can do all and she will not stir. When she awakens she will think a magician has been here. "

He smiled as if his heart warmed under his white robe, and the secretary smiled back at him.

" It will be like a story from the' Arabian Nights, ' " he said. " Only an Oriental could have planned it. It does not belong to London fogs. "

They did not remain very long, to the great relief of Melchisedec, who, as he probably did not comprehend their conversation, felt their movements and whispers ominous. The young secretary seemed interested in everything. He wrote down things about the floor, the fireplace, the broken footstool, the old table, the walls - which last he touched with his hand again and again, seeming much pleased when he found that a number of old nails had been driven in various places.

" You can hang things on them, " he said.

Ram Dass smiled mysteriously.

" Yesterday, when she was out, " he said, " I entered, bringing with me small, sharp nails which can be pressed into the wall without blows from a hammer. I placed many in the plaster where I may need them. They are ready. "

The Indian gentleman's secretary stood still and looked round him as he thrust his tablets back into his pocket.

" I think I have made notes enough; we can go now, " he said. " The Sahib Carrisford has a warm heart. It is a thousand pities that he has not found the lost child. "

" If he should find her his strength would be restored to him, " said Ram Dass. " His God may lead her to him yet. "

Then they slipped through the skylight as noiselessly as they had entered it. And, after he was quite sure they had gone, Melchisedec was greatly relieved, and in the course of a few minutes felt it safe to emerge from his hole again and scuffle about in the hope that even such alarming human beings as these might have chanced to carry crumbs in their pockets and drop one or two of them.





CHAPTER ⅩⅤ　THE MAGIC


WHEN Sara had passed the house next door she had seen Ram Dass closing the shutters, and caught her glimpse of this room also.

" It is a long time since I saw a nice place from the inside, " was the thought which crossed her mind.

There was the usual bright fire glowing in the grate, and the Indian gentleman was sitting before it. His head was resting in his hand, and he looked as lonely and unhappy as ever.

" Poor man! " said Sara; " I wonder what you are supposing. "

And this was what he was " Supposing " at that very moment.

" Suppose, " he was thinking, " Suppose - even if Carmichael traces the people to Moscow - the little girl they took from Madame Pascal's school in Paris is NOT the one we are in search of. Suppose she proves to be quite a different child. What steps shall I take next? "

When Sara went into the house she met Miss Minchin, who had come downstairs to scold the cook.

" Where have you wasted your time? " she demanded. " You have been out for hours. "

" It was so wet and muddy, " Sara answered, " It was hard to walk, because my shoes were so bad and slipped about. "

" Make no excuses, " said Miss Minchin, " and tell no falsehoods. "

Sara went in to the cook. The cook had received a severe lecture and was in a fearful temper as a result. She was only too rejoiced to have someone to vent her rage on, and Sara was a convenience, as usual.

" Why didn' t you stay all night? " she snapped.

Sara laid her purchases on the table.

" Here are the things, " she said.

The cook looked them over, grumbling. She was in a very savage humor indeed.

" May I have something to eat? " Sara asked rather faintly.

" Tea's over and done with, " was the answer. " Did you expect me to keep it hot for you? "

Sara stood silent for a second.

" I had no dinner, " she said next, and her voice was quite low. She made it low because she was afraid it would tremble.

" There's some bread in the pantry, " said the cook. " That's all you' ll get at this time of day. "

Sara went and found the bread. It was old and hard and dry. The cook was in too vicious a humor to give her anything to eat with it. It was always safe and easy to vent her spite on Sara. Really, it was hard for the child to climb the three long flights of stairs leading to her attic. She often found them long and steep when she was tired; but tonight it seemed as if she would never reach the top. Several times she was obliged to stop to rest. When she reached the top landing she was glad to see the glimmer of a light coming from under her door. That meant that Ermengarde had managed to creep up to pay her a visit. There was some comfort in that. It was better than to go into the room alone and find it empty and desolate. The mere presence of plump, comfortable Ermengarde, wrapped in her red shawl, would warm it a little.

Yes; there Ermengarde was when she opened the door. She was sitting in the middle of the bed, with her feet tucked safely under her. She had never become intimate with Melchisedec and his family, though they rather fascinated her. When she found herself alone in the attic she always preferred to sit on the bed until Sara arrived. She had, in fact, on this occasion had time to become rather nervous, because Melchisedec had appeared and sniffed about a good deal, and once had made her utter a repressed squeal by sitting up on his hind legs and, while he looked at her, sniffing pointedly in her direction.

" Oh, Sara, " she cried out, " I am glad you have come. Melchy WOULD sniff about so. I tried to coax him to go back, but he wouldn' t for such a long time. I like him, you know; but it does frighten me when he sniffs right at me. Do you think he ever WOULD jump? "

" No, " answered Sara.

Ermengarde crawled forward on the bed to look at her.

" You DO look tired, Sara, " she said; " You are quite pale. "

" I AM tired, " said Sara, dropping on to the lopsided footstool. " Oh, there's Melchisedec, poor thing. He's come to ask for his supper. "

Melchisedec had come out of his hole as if he had been listening for her footstep. Sara was quite sure he knew it. He came forward with an affectionate, expectant expression as Sara put her hand in her pocket and turned it inside out, shaking her head.

" I' m very sorry, " she said. " I haven' t one crumb left. Go home, Melchisedec, and tell your wife there was nothing in my pocket. I' m afraid I forgot because the cook and Miss Minchin were so cross. "

Melchisedec seemed to understand. He shuffled resignedly, if not contentedly, back to his home.

" I did not expect to see you tonight, Ermie, " Sara said.

Ermengarde hugged herself in the red shawl.

" Miss Amelia has gone out to spend the night with her old aunt, " she explained. " No one else ever comes and looks into the bedrooms after we are in bed. I could stay here until morning if I wanted to. "

She pointed toward the table under the skylight. Sara had not looked toward it as she came in. A number of books were piled upon it. Ermengarde's gesture was a dejected one.

" Papa has sent me some more books, Sara, " she said. " There they are. "

Sara looked round and got up at once. She ran to the table, and picking up the top volume, turned over its leaves quickly. For the moment she forgot her discomforts.

" Ah, " she cried out, " how beautiful! Carlyle's French Revolution. I have SO wanted to read that! "

" I haven' t, " said Ermengarde. " And papa will be so cross if I don' t. He' ll expect me to know all about it when I go home for the holidays. What SHALL I do? "

Sara stopped turning over the leaves and looked at her with an excited flush on her cheeks.

" Look here, " she cried, " If you' ll lend me these books, I' ll read them - and tell you everything that's in them afterward - and I' ll tell it so that you will remember it, too. "

" Oh, goodness! " exclaimed Ermengarde. " Do you think you can? "

" I know I can, " Sara answered. " The little ones always remember what I tell them. "

" Sara, " said Ermengarde, hope gleaming in her round face, " If you' ll do that, and make me remember, I' ll - I' ll give you anything. "

" I don' t want you to give me anything, " said Sara. " I want your books - I want them! " And her eyes grew big, and her chest heaved.

" Take them, then, " said Ermengarde. " I wish I wanted them - but I don' t. I' m not clever, and my father is, and he thinks I ought to be. "

Sara was opening one book after the other. " What are you going to tell your father? " she asked, a slight doubt dawning in her mind.

" Oh, he needn' t know, " answered Ermengarde. " He' ll think I' ve read them. "

Sara put down her book and shook her head slowly. " That's almost like telling lies, " she said. " And lies - well, you see, they are not only wicked - they' re VULGAR. Sometimes " - reflectively - " I' ve thought perhaps I might do something wicked - might suddenly fly into a rage and kill Miss Minchin, you know, when she was ill - treating me - but I COULDN' T be vulgar. Why can' t you tell your father I read them? "

" He wants me to read them, " said Ermengarde, a little discouraged by this unexpected turn of affairs.

" He wants you to know what is in them, " said Sara. " And if I can tell it to you in an easy way and make you remember it, I should think he would like that. "

" He' ll like it if I learn anything in ANY way, " said rueful Ermengarde. " You would if you were my father. "

" It's not your fault that - " began Sara. She pulled herself up and stopped rather suddenly. She had been going to say, " It's not your fault that you are stupid. "

" That what? " Ermengarde asked.

" That you can' t learn things quickly, " amended Sara. " If you can' t, you can' t. If I can - why, I can; that's all. "

She always felt very tender of Ermengarde, and tried not to let her feel too strongly the difference between being able to learn anything at once, and not being able to learn anything at all. As she looked at her plump face, one of her wise, old - fashioned thoughts came to her.

" Perhaps, " she said, " to be able to learn things quickly isn' t everything. To be kind is worth a great deal to other people. If Miss Minchin knew everything on earth and was like what she is now, she' d still be a detestable thing, and everybody would hate her. Lots of clever people have done harm and have been wicked. Look at Robespierre - "

She stopped and examined Ermengarde's countenance, which was beginning to look bewildered. " Don' t you remember? " she demanded. " I told you about him not long ago. I believe you' ve forgotten. "

" Well, I don' t remember ALL of it, " admitted Ermengarde.

" Well, you wait a minute, " said Sara, " and I' ll take off my wet things and wrap myself in the coverlet and tell you over again. "

She took off her hat and coat and hung them on a nail against the wall, and she changed her wet shoes for an old pair of slippers. Then she jumped on the bed, and drawing the coverlet about her shoulders, sat with her arms round her knees.

" Now, listen, " she said.

She plunged into the gory records of the French Revolution, and told such stories of it that Ermengarde's eyes grew round with alarm and she held her breath. But though she was rather terrified, there was a delightful thrill in listening, and she was not likely to forget Robespierre again, or to have any doubts about the Princesse de Lamballe.

" You know they put her head on a pike and danced round it, " Sara explained. " And she had beautiful floating blonde hair; and when I think of her, I never see her head on her body, but always on a pike, with those furious people dancing and howling. "

It was agreed that Mr. St. John was to be told the plan they had made, and for the present the books were to be left in the attic.

" Now let's tell each other things, " said Sara. " How are you getting on with your French lessons? "

" Ever so much better since the last time I came up here and you explained the conjugations. Miss Minchin could not understand why I did my exercises so well that first morning. "

Sara laughed a little and hugged her knees.

" She doesn' t understand why Lottie is doing her sums so well, " she said; " but it is because she creeps up here, too, and I help her. " She glanced round the room. " The attic would be rather nice - if it wasn' t so dreadful, " she said, laughing again. " It's a good place to pretend in. "

The truth was that Ermengarde did not know anything of the sometimes almost unbearable side of life in the attic, and she had not a sufficiently vivid imagination to depict it for herself. On the rare occasions that she could reach Sara's room she only saw that side of it which was made exciting by things which were " pretended " and stories which were told. Her visits partook of the character of adventures; and though sometimes Sara looked rather pale, and it was not to be denied that she had grown very thin, her proud little spirit would not admit of complaints. She had never confessed that at times she was almost ravenous with hunger, as she was tonight. She was growing rapidly, and her constant walking and running about would have given her a keen appetite even if she had had abundant and regular meals of a much more nourishing nature than the unappetizing, inferior food snatched at such odd times as suited the kitchen convenience. She was growing used to a certain gnawing feeling in her young stomach.

" I suppose soldiers feel like this when they are on a long and weary march, " she often said to herself. She liked the sound of the phrase, " long and weary march. " It made her feel rather like a soldier. She had also a quaint sense of being a hostess in the attic.

" If I lived in a castle, " she argued, " and Ermengarde was the lady of another castle, and came to see me, with knights and squires and vassals riding with her, and pennons flying; when I heard the clarions sounding outside the drawbridge I should go down to receive her, and I should spread feasts in the banquet - hall and call in minstrels to sing and play and relate romances. When she comes into the attic I can' t spread feasts, but I can tell stories, and not let her know disagreeable things. I dare say poor chatelaine had to do that in times of famine, when their lands had been pillaged. " She was a proud, brave little chatelaine, and dispensed generously the one hospitality she could offer - the dreams she dreamed - the visions she saw - the imaginings which were her joy and comfort.

So, as they sat together, Ermengarde did not know that she was faint as well as ravenous, and that while she talked she now and then wondered if her hunger would let her sleep when she was left alone. She felt as if she had never been quite so hungry before.

" I wish I was as thin as you, Sara, " Ermengarde said suddenly. " I believe you are thinner than you used to be. Your eyes look so big, and look at the sharp little bones sticking out of your elbow! "

Sara pulled down her sleeve, which had pushed itself up. " I always was a thin child, " she said bravely, " and I always had big green eyes. "

" I love your queer eyes, " said Ermengarde, looking into them with affectionate admiration. " They always look as if they saw such a long way. I love them - and I love them to be green - though they look black generally. "

" They are cat's eyes, " laughed Sara; " But I can' t see in the dark with them - because I have tried, and I couldn' t - I wish I could. "

It was just at this minute that something happened at the skylight which neither of them saw. If either of them had chanced to turn and look, she would have been startled by the sight of a dark face which peered cautiously into the room and disappeared as quickly and almost as silently as it had appeared. Not QUITE as silently, however. Sara, who had keen ears, suddenly turned a little and looked up at the roof.

" That didn' t sound like Melchisedec, " she said. " It wasn' t scratchy enough. "

" What? " said Ermengarde, a little startled.

" Didn' t you think you heard something? " asked Sara.

" N - no, " Ermengarde faltered. " Did you? "

" Perhaps I didn' t, " said Sara; " But I thought I did. It sounded as if something was on the slates - something that dragged softly. "

" What could it be? " said Ermengarde. " Could it be - robbers? "

" No, " Sara began cheerfully. " There is nothing to steal - "

She broke off in the middle of her words. They both heard the sound that checked her. It was not on the slates, but on the stairs below, and it was Miss Minchin's angry voice. Sara sprang off the bed, and put out the candle.

" She is scolding Becky, " she whispered, as she stood in the darkness. " She is making her cry. "

" Will she come in here? " Ermengarde whispered back, panic - stricken.

" No. She will think I am in bed. Don' t stir. "

It was very seldom that Miss Minchin mounted the last flight of stairs. Sara could only remember that she had done it once before. But now she was angry enough to be coming at least part of the way up, and it sounded as if she was driving Becky before her.

" You impudent, dishonest child! " they heard her say. " Cook tells me she has missed things repeatedly. "

" ' T warn' t me, mum, " said Becky, sobbing. " I was' ungry enough, but' t war n' t me - never! "

" You deserve to be sent to prison, " said Miss Minchin's voice. " Picking and stealing! Half a meat pie, indeed! "

" ' T warn' t me, " wept Becky. " I could' ave eat a whole un - but I never laid a finger on it. "

Miss Minchin was out of breath between temper and mounting the stairs. The meat pie had been intended for her special late supper. It became apparent that she boxed Becky's ears.

" Don' t tell falsehoods, " she said. " Go to your room this instant. "

Both Sara and Ermengarde heard the slap, and then heard Becky run in her slipshod shoes up the stairs and into her attic. They heard her door shut, and knew that she threw herself upon her bed.

" I could' ave e' t two of' em, " they heard her cry into her pillow. " An' I never took a bite. ' Twas cook give it to her policeman. "

Sara stood in the middle of the room in the darkness. She was clenching her little teeth and opening and shutting fiercely her outstretched hands. She could scarcely stand still, but she dared not move until Miss Minchin had gone down the stairs and all was still.

" The wicked, cruel thing! " she burst forth. " The cook takes things herself and then says Becky steals them. She DOESN' T! She DOESN' T! She's so hungry sometimes that she eats crusts out of the ash barrel! " She pressed her hands hard against her face and burst into passionate little sobs, and Ermengarde, hearing this unusual thing, was overawed by it. Sara was crying! The unconquerable Sara! It seemed to denote something new - some mood she had never known. Suppose - Suppose - A new dread possibility presented itself to her kind, slow, little mind all at once. She crept off the bed in the dark and found her way to the table where the candle stood. She struck a match and lit the candle. When she had lighted it, she bent forward and looked at Sara, with her new thought growing to definite fear in her eyes.

" Sara, " she said in a timid, almost awe - stricken voice, " are - are - you never told me - I don' t want to be rude, but - are YOU ever hungry? "

It was too much just at that moment. The barrier broke down. Sara lifted her face from her hands.

" Yes, " she said in a new passionate way. " Yes, I am. I' m so hungry now that I could almost eat you. And it makes it worse to hear poor Becky. She's hungrier than I am. "

Ermengarde gasped.

" Oh! Oh! " she cried woefully; " And I never knew! "

" I didn' t want you to know, " Sara said. " It would have made me feel like a street beggar. I know I look like a street beggar. "

" No, you don' t - you don' t! " Ermengarde broke in. " Your clothes are a little queer - but you couldn' t look like a street beggar. You haven' t a street - beggar face. "

" A little boy once gave me a sixpence for charity, " said Sara, with a short little laugh in spite of herself. " Here it is. " And she pulled out the thin ribbon from her neck. " He wouldn' t have given me his Christmas sixpence if I hadn' t looked as if I needed it. "

Somehow the sight of the dear little sixpence was good for both of them. It made them laugh a little, though they both had tears in their eyes.

" Who was he? " asked Ermengarde, looking at it quite as if it had not been a mere ordinary silver sixpence.

" He was a darling little thing going to a party, " said Sara. " He was one of the Large Family, the little one with the round legs - the one I call Guy Clarence. I suppose his nursery was crammed with Christmas presents and hampers full of cakes and things, and he could see I had nothing. "

Ermengarde gave a little jump backward. The last sentences had recalled something to her troubled mind and given her a sudden inspiration.

" Oh, Sara! " she cried. " What a silly thing I am not to have thought of it! "

" Of what? "

" Something splendid! " said Ermengarde, in an excited hurry. " This very afternoon my nicest aunt sent me a box. It is full of good things. I never touched it, I had so much pudding at dinner, and I was so bothered about papa's books. " Her words began to tumble over each other. " It's got cake in it, and little meat pies, and jam tarts and buns, and oranges and red - currant wine, and figs and chocolate. I' ll creep back to my room and get it this minute, and we' ll eat it now. "

Sara almost reeled. When one is faint with hunger the mention of food has sometimes a curious effect. She clutched Ermengarde's arm.

" Do you think - you COULD? " she ejaculated.

" I know I could, " answered Ermengarde, and she ran to the door - opened it softly - put her head out into the darkness, and listened. Then she went back to Sara.

" The lights are out. Everybody's in bed. I can creep - and creep - and no one will hear. "

It was so delightful that they caught each other's hands and a sudden light sprang into Sara's eyes.

" Ermie! " she said. " Let us PRETEND! Let us pretend it's a party! And oh, won' t you invite the prisoner in the next cell? "

" Yes! Yes! Let us knock on the wall now. The jailer won' t hear. "

Sara went to the wall. Through it she could hear poor Becky crying more softly. She knocked four times.

" That means, ' Come to me through the secret passage under the wall, ' " she explained. " ' I have something to communicate. ' "

Five quick knocks answered her.

" She is coming, " she said.

Almost immediately the door of the attic opened and Becky appeared. Her eyes were red and her cap was sliding off, and when she caught sight of Ermengarde she began to rub her face nervously with her apron.

" Don' t mind me a bit, Becky! " cried Ermengarde.

" Miss Ermengarde has asked you to come in, " said Sara, " Because she is going to bring a box of good things up here to us. "

Becky's cap almost fell off entirely, she broke in with such excitement.

" To eat, miss? " she said. " Things that's good to eat? "

" Yes, " answered Sara, " and we are going to pretend a party. "

" And you shall have as much as you WANT to eat, " put in Ermengarde. " I' ll go this minute! "

She was in such haste that as she tiptoed out of the attic she dropped her red shawl and did not know it had fallen. No one saw it for a minute or so. Becky was too much overpowered by the good luck which had befallen her.

" Oh, miss! oh, miss! " she gasped; " I know it was you that asked her to let me come. It - it makes me cry to think of it. " And she went to Sara's side and stood and looked at her worshippingly.

But in Sara's hungry eyes the old light had begun to glow and transform her world for her. Here in the attic - with the cold night outside - with the afternoon in the sloppy streets barely passed - with the memory of the awful unfed look in the beggar child's eyes not yet faded - this simple, cheerful thing had happened like a thing of magic.

She caught her breath.

" Somehow, something always happens, " she cried, " just before things get to the very worst. It is as if the Magic did it. If I could only just remember that always. The worst thing never QUITE comes. "

She gave Becky a little cheerful shake.

" No, no! You mustn' t cry! " she said. " We must make haste and set the table. "

" Set the table, miss? " said Becky, gazing round the room. " What' ll we set it with? "

Sara looked round the attic, too.

" There doesn' t seem to be much, " she answered, half laughing.

That moment she saw something and pounced upon it. It was Ermengarde's red shawl which lay upon the floor.

" Here's the shawl, " she cried. " I know she won' t mind it. It will make such a nice red tablecloth. "

They pulled the old table forward, and threw the shawl over it. Red is a wonderfully kind and comfortable color. It began to make the room look furnished directly.

" How nice a red rug would look on the floor! " exclaimed Sara. " We must pretend there is one! "

Her eye swept the bare boards with a swift glance of admiration. The rug was laid down already.

" How soft and thick it is! " she said, with the little laugh which Becky knew the meaning of; and she raised and set her foot down again delicately, as if she felt something under it.

" Yes, miss, " answered Becky, watching her with serious rapture. She was always quite serious.

" What next, now? " said Sara, and she stood still and put her hands over her eyes. " Something will come if I think and wait a little " - in a soft, expectant voice. " The Magic will tell me. "

One of her favorite fancies was that on " the outside, " as she called it, thoughts were waiting for people to call them. Becky had seen her stand and wait many a time before, and knew that in a few seconds she would uncover an enlightened, laughing face.

In a moment she did.

" There! " she cried. " It has come! I know now! I must look among the things in the old trunk I had when I was a princess. "

She flew to its corner and kneeled down. It had not been put in the attic for her benefit, but because there was no room for it elsewhere. Nothing had been left in it but rubbish. But she knew she should find something. The Magic always arranged that kind of thing in one way or another.

In a corner lay a package so insignificant - looking that it had been overlooked, and when she herself had found it she had kept it as a relic. It contained a dozen small white handkerchiefs. She seized them joyfully and ran to the table. She began to arrange them upon the red table - cover, patting and coaxing them into shape with the narrow lace edge curling outward, her Magic working its spells for her as she did it.

" These are the plates, " she said. " They are golden plates. These are the richly embroidered napkins. Nuns worked them in convents in Spain. "

" Did they, miss? " breathed Becky, her very soul uplifted by the information.

" You must pretend it, " said Sara. " If you pretend it enough, you will see them. "

" Yes, miss, " said Becky; and as Sara returned to the trunk she devoted herself to the effort of accomplishing an end so much to be desired.

Sara turned suddenly to find her standing by the table, looking very queer indeed. She had shut her eyes, and was twisting her face in strange, convulsive contortions, her hands hanging stiffly clenched at her sides. She looked as if she was trying to lift some enormous weight.

" What is the matter, Becky? " Sara cried. " What are you doing? "

Becky opened her eyes with a start.

" I was a' pretendin' , miss, " she answered a little sheepishly; " I was tryin' to see it like you do. I almost did, " with a hopeful grin. " But it takes a lot o'stren' th. "

" Perhaps it does if you are not used to it, " said Sara, with friendly sympathy; " But you don' t know how easy it is when you' ve done it often. I wouldn' t try so hard just at first. It will come to you after a while. I' ll just tell you what things are. Look at these. "

She held an old summer hat in her hand which she had fished out of the bottom of the trunk. There was a wreath of flowers on it. She pulled the wreath off.

" These are garlands for the feast, " she said grandly. " They fill all the air with perfume. There's a mug on the wash - stand, Becky. Oh - and bring the soap dish for a centrepiece. "

Becky handed them to her reverently.

" What are they now, miss? " she inquired. " You' d think they was made of crockery - but I know they ain' t. "

" This is a carven flagon, " said Sara, arranging tendrils of the wreath about the mug. " And this " - bending tenderly over the soap dish and heaping it with roses - " is purest alabaster encrusted with gems. "

She touched the things gently, a happy smile hovering about her lips which made her look as if she were a creature in a dream.

" My, ain' t it lovely! " whispered Becky.

" If we just had something for bonbon dishes, " Sara murmured. " There! " - darting to the trunk again. " I remember I saw something this minute. "

It was only a bundle of wool wrapped in red and white tissue paper, but the tissue paper was soon twisted into the form of little dishes, and was combined with the remaining flowers to ornament the candlestick which was to light the feast. Only the Magic could have made it more than an old table covered with a red shawl and set with rubbish from a long - unopened trunk. But Sara drew back and gazed at it, seeing wonders; and Becky, after staring in delight, spoke with bated breath.

" This' ere, " she suggested, with a glance round the attic - " is it the Bastille now - or has it turned into somethin' different? "

" Oh, yes, yes! " said Sara; " Quite different. It is a banquet hall! "

" My eye, miss! " ejaculated Becky. " A blanket' all! " and she turned to view the splendors about her with awed bewilderment.

" A banquet hall, " said Sara. " A vast chamber where feasts are given. It has a vaulted roof, and a minstrels' gallery, and a huge chimney filled with blazing oaken logs, and it is brilliant with waxen tapers twinkling on every side. "

" My eye, Miss Sara! " gasped Becky again.

Then the door opened, and Ermengarde came in, rather staggering under the weight of her hamper. She started back with an exclamation of joy. To enter from the chill darkness outside, and find one's self confronted by a totally unanticipated festal board, draped with red, adorned with white napery, and wreathed with flowers, was to feel that the preparations were brilliant indeed.

" Oh, Sara! " she cried out. " You are the cleverest girl I ever saw! "

" Isn' t it nice? " said Sara. " They are things out of my old trunk. I asked my Magic, and it told me to go and look. "

" But oh, miss, " cried Becky, " Wait till she's told you what they are! They ain' t just - oh, miss, please tell her, " appealing to Sara.

So Sara told her, and because her Magic helped her she made her ALMOST see it all: the golden platters - the vaulted spaces - the blazing logs - the twinkling waxen tapers. As the things were taken out of the hamper - the frosted cakes - the fruits - the bonbons and the wine - the feast became a splendid thing.

" It's like a real party! " cried Ermengarde.

" It's like a queen's table, " sighed Becky.

Then Ermengarde had a sudden brilliant thought.

" I' ll tell you what, Sara, " she said. " Pretend you are a princess now and this is a royal feast. "

" But it's your feast, " said Sara; " You must be the princess, and we will be your maids of honor. "

" Oh, I can' t, " said Ermengarde. " I' m too fat, and I don' t know how. YOU be her. "

" Well, if you want me to, " said Sara.

But suddenly she thought of something else and ran to the rusty grate.

" There is a lot of paper and rubbish stuffed in here! " she exclaimed. " If we light it, there will be a bright blaze for a few minutes, and we shall feel as if it was a real fire. " She struck a match and lighted it up with a great specious glow which illuminated the room.

" By the time it stops blazing, " Sara said, " We shall forget about its not being real. "

She stood in the dancing glow and smiled.

" Doesn' t it LOOK real? " she said. " Now we will begin the party. "

She led the way to the table. She waved her hand graciously to Ermengarde and Becky. She was in the midst of her dream.

" Advance, fair damsels, " she said in her happy dream - voice, " and be seated at the banquet table. My noble father, the king, who is absent on a long journey, has commanded me to feast you. " She turned her head slightly toward the corner of the room. " What, ho! there, minstrels! Strike up with your viols and bassoons. Princesses, " she explained rapidly to Ermengarde and Becky, " always had minstrels to play at their feasts. Pretend there is a minstrel gallery up there in the corner. Now we will begin. "

They had barely had time to take their pieces of cake into their hands - not one of them had time to do more, when - they all three sprang to their feet and turned pale faces toward the door - listening - listening.

Some one was coming up the stairs. There was no mistake about it. Each of them recognized the angry, mounting tread and knew that the end of all things had come.

" It's - the missus! " choked Becky, and dropped her piece of cake upon the floor.

" Yes, " said Sara, her eyes growing shocked and large in her small white face. " Miss Minchin has found us out. "

Miss Minchin struck the door open with a blow of her hand. She was pale herself, but it was with rage. She looked from the frightened faces to the banquet table, and from the banquet table to the last flicker of the burnt paper in the grate.

" I have been suspecting something of this sort, " she exclaimed; " but I did not dream of such audacity. Lavinia was telling the truth. "

So they knew that it was Lavinia who had somehow guessed their secret and had betrayed them. Miss Minchin strode over to Becky and boxed her ears for a second time.

" You impudent creature! " she said. " You leave the house in the morning! "

Sara stood quite still, her eyes growing larger, her face paler. Ermengarde burst into tears.

" Oh, don' t send her away, " she sobbed. " My aunt sent me the hamper. We' re - only - having a party. "

" So I see, " said Miss Minchin, witheringly. " With the Princess Sara at the head of the table. " She turned fiercely on Sara. " It is your doing, I know, " she cried. " Ermengarde would never have thought of such a thing. You decorated the table, I suppose - with this rubbish. " She stamped her foot at Becky. " Go to your attic! " she commanded, and Becky stole away, her face hidden in her apron, her shoulders shaking.

Then it was Sara's turn again.

" I will attend to you tomorrow. You shall have neither breakfast, dinner, nor supper! "

" I have not had either dinner or supper today. Miss Minchin, " said Sara, rather faintly.

" Then all the better. You will have something to remember. Don' t stand there. Put those things into the hamper again. "

She began to sweep them off the table into the hamper herself, and caught sight of Ermengarde's new books. " And you " - to Ermengarde - " have brought your beautiful new books into this dirty attic. Take them up and go back to bed. You will stay there all day tomorrow, and I shall write to your papa. What would HE say if he knew where you are tonight? "

Something she saw in Sara's grave, fixed gaze at this moment made her turn on her fiercely.

" What are you thinking of? " she demanded. " Why do you look at me like that? "

" I was wondering, " answered Sara, as she had answered that notable day in the schoolroom.

" What were you wondering? "

It was very like the scene in the schoolroom. There was no pertness in Sara's manner. It was only sad and quiet.

" I was wondering, " she said in a low voice, " What MY papa would say if he knew where I am tonight. "

Miss Minchin was infuriated just as she had been before, and her anger expressed itself, as before, in an intemperate fashion. She flew at her and shook her.

" You insolent, unmanageable child! " she cried. " How dare you! How dare you! "

She picked up the books, swept the rest of the feast back into the hamper in a jumbled heap, thrust it into Ermengarde's arms, and pushed her before her toward the door.

" I will leave you to wonder, " she said. " Go to bed this instant. " And she shut the door behind herself and poor stumbling Ermengarde, and left Sara standing quite alone.

The dream was quite at an end. The last spark had died out of the paper in the grate and left only black tinder; the table was left bare, the golden plates and richly embroidered napkins, and the garlands were transformed again into old handkerchiefs, scraps of red and white paper, and discarded artificial flowers all scattered on the floor; the minstrels in the minstrel gallery had stolen away, and the viols and bassoons were still. Emily was sitting with her back against the wall, staring very hard. Sara saw her, and went and picked her up with trembling hands.

" There isn' t any banquet left, Emily, " she said. " And there isn' t any princess. There is nothing left but the prisoners in the Bastille. " And she sat down and hid her face.

What would have happened if she had not hidden it just then, and if she had chanced to look up at the skylight at the wrong moment, I do not know - perhaps the end of this chapter might have been quite different - because if she had glanced at the skylight she would certainly have been startled by what she would have seen. She would have seen exactly the same face pressed against the glass and peering in at her as it had peered in earlier in the evening when she had been talking to Ermengarde.

But she did not look up. She sat with her little black head in her arms for some time. She always sat like that when she was trying to bear something in silence. Then she got up and went slowly to the bed.

" I can' t pretend anything else - while I am awake, " she said. " There wouldn' t be any use in trying. If I go to sleep, perhaps a dream will come and pretend for me. "

She suddenly felt so tired - perhaps through want of food - that she sat down on the edge of the bed quite weakly.

" Suppose there was a bright fire in the grate, with lots of little dancing flames, " she murmured. " Suppose there was a comfortable chair before it - and suppose there was a small table near, with a little hot - hot supper on it. And suppose " - as she drew the thin coverings over her - " Suppose this was a beautiful soft bed, with fleecy blankets and large downy pillows. Suppose - suppose - " And her very weariness was good to her, for her eyes closed and she fell fast asleep.

* * * * * *

She did not know how long she slept. But she had been tired enough to sleep deeply and profoundly - too deeply and soundly to be disturbed by anything, even by the squeaks and scamperings of Melchisedec's entire family, if all his sons and daughters had chosen to come out of their hole to fight and tumble and play.

When she awakened it was rather suddenly, and she did not know that any particular thing had called her out of her sleep. The truth was, however, that it was a sound which had called her back - a real sound - the click of the skylight as it fell in closing after a lithe white figure which slipped through it and crouched down close by upon the slates of the roof - just near enough to see what happened in the attic, but not near enough to be seen.

At first she did not open her eyes. She felt too sleepy and - curiously enough - too warm and comfortable. She was so warm and comfortable, indeed, that she did not believe she was really awake. She never was as warm and cozy as this except in some lovely vision.

" What a nice dream! " she murmured. " I feel quite warm. I - don' t - want - to - wake - up. "

Of course it was a dream. She felt as if warm, delightful bedclothes were heaped upon her. She could actually FEEL blankets, and when she put out her hand it touched something exactly like a satin - covered eider - down quilt. She must not awaken from this delight - she must be quite still and make it last.

But she could not - even though she kept her eyes closed tightly, she could not. Something was forcing her to awaken - something in the room. It was a sense of light, and a sound - the sound of a crackling, roaring little fire.

" Oh, I am awakening, " she said mournfully. " I can' t help it - I can' t. "

Her eyes opened in spite of herself. And then she actually smiled - for what she saw she had never seen in the attic before, and knew she never should see.

" Oh, I HAVEN' T awakened, " she whispered, daring to rise on her elbow and look all about her, " I am dreaming yet. " She knew it MUST be a dream, for if she were awake such things could not - could not be.

Do you wonder that she felt sure she had not come back to earth? This is what she saw. In the grate there was a glowing, blazing fire; on the hob was a little brass kettle hissing and boiling; spread upon the floor was a thick, warm crimson rug; before the fire a folding - chair, unfolded, and with cushions on it; by the chair a small folding - table, unfolded, covered with a white cloth, and upon it spread small covered dishes, a cup, a saucer, a tea - pot; on the bed were new warm coverings and a satin - covered down quilt; at the foot a curious wadded silk robe, a pair of quilted slippers, and some books. The room of her dream seemed changed into fairyland - and it was flooded with warm light, for a bright lamp stood on the table covered with a rosy shade.

She sat up, resting on her elbow, and her breathing came short and fast.

" It does not - melt away, " she panted. " Oh, I never had such a dream before. " She scarcely dared to stir; but at last she pushed the bedclothes aside, and put her feet on the floor with a rapturous smile.

" I am dreaming - I am getting out of bed, " she heard her own voice say; and then, as she stood up in the midst of it all, turning slowly from side to side - " I am dreaming it stays - real! I' m dreaming it FEELS real. It's bewitched - or I' m bewitched. I only THINK I see it all. " Her words began to hurry themselves. " If I can only keep on thinking it, " she cried, " I don' t care! I don' t care! "

She stood panting a moment longer, and then cried out again.

" Oh, it isn' t true! " she said. " It CAN' T be true! But oh, how true it seems! "

The blazing fire drew her to it, and she knelt down and held out her hands close to it - so close that the heat made her start back.

" A fire I only dreamed wouldn' t be HOT, " she cried.

She sprang up, touched the table, the dishes, the rug; she went to the bed and touched the blankets. She took up the soft wadded dressing - gown, and suddenly clutched it to her breast and held it to her cheek.

" It's warm. It's soft! " she almost sobbed. " It's real. It must be! "

She threw it over her shoulders, and put her feet into the slippers.

" They are real, too. It's all real! " she cried. " I am NOT - I am NOT dreaming! "

She almost staggered to the books and opened the one which lay upon the top. Something was written on the flyleaf - just a few words, and they were these:

" To the little girl in the attic. From a friend. "

When she saw that - wasn' t it a strange thing for her to do? - she put her face down upon the page and burst into tears.

" I don' t know who it is, " she said; " But somebody cares for me a little. I have a friend. "

She took her candle and stole out of her own room and into Becky's, and stood by her bedside.

" Becky, Becky! " she whispered as loudly as she dared. " Wake up! "

When Becky wakened, and she sat upright staring aghast, her face still smudged with traces of tears, beside her stood a little figure in a luxurious wadded robe of crimson silk. The face she saw was a shining, wonderful thing. The Princess Sara - as she remembered her - stood at her very bedside, holding a candle in her hand.

" Come, " she said. " Oh, Becky, come! "

Becky was too frightened to speak. She simply got up and followed her, with her mouth and eyes open, and without a word.

And when they crossed the threshold, Sara shut the door gently and drew her into the warm, glowing midst of things which made her brain reel and her hungry senses faint.

" It's true! It's true! " she cried. " I' ve touched them all. They are as real as we are. The Magic has come and done it, Becky, while we were asleep - the Magic that won' t let those worst things EVER quite happen. "





CHAPTER ⅩⅥ　THE VISITOR


IMAGINE, if you can, what the rest of the evening was like. How they crouched by the fire which blazed and leaped and made so much of itself in the little grate. How they removed the covers of the dishes, and found rich, hot, savory soup, which was a meal in itself, and sandwiches and toast and muffins enough for both of them. The mug from the washstand was used as Becky's tea cup, and the tea was so delicious that it was not necessary to pretend that it was anything else but tea. They were warm and full - fed and happy, and it was just like Sara that, having found her strange good fortune real, she should give herself up to the enjoyment of it to the utmost. She had lived such a life of imaginings that she was quite equal to accepting any wonderful thing that happened, and almost to cease, in a short time, to find it bewildering.

" I don' t know anyone in the world who could have done it, " she said; " But there has been someone. And here we are sitting by their fire - and - and - it's true! And whoever it is - wherever they are - I have a friend, Becky - someone is my friend. "

It cannot be denied that as they sat before the blazing fire, and ate the nourishing, comfortable food, they felt a kind of rapturous awe, and looked into each other's eyes with something like doubt.

" Do you think, " Becky faltered once, in a whisper, " do you think it could melt away, miss? Hadn' t we better be quick? " And she hastily crammed her sandwich into her mouth. If it was only a dream, kitchen manners would be overlooked.

" No, it won' t melt away, " said Sara. " I am EATING this muffin, and I can taste it. You never really eat things in dreams. You only think you are going to eat them. Besides, I keep giving myself pinches; and I touched a hot piece of coal just now, on purpose. "

The sleepy comfort which at length almost overpowered them was a heavenly thing. It was the drowsiness of happy, well - fed childhood, and they sat in the fire glow and luxuriated in it until Sara found herself turning to look at her transformed bed.

There were even blankets enough to share with Becky. The narrow couch in the next attic was more comfortable that night than its occupant had ever dreamed that it could be.

As she went out of the room, Becky turned upon the threshold and looked about her with devouring eyes.

" If it ain' t here in the mornin' , miss, " she said, " It's been here to - night, anyways, an' I shan' t never forget it. " She looked at each particular thing, as if to commit it to memory. " The fire was THERE, " pointing with her finger, " an' the table was before it; an' the lamp was there, an' the light looked rosy red; an' there was a satin cover on your bed, an' a warm rug on the floor, an' everythin' looked beautiful; an' " - she paused a second, and laid her hand on her stomach tenderly - " There WAS soup an'sandwiches an' muffins - there WAS. " And, with this conviction a reality at least, she went away.

Through the mysterious agency which works in schools and among servants, it was quite well known in the morning that Sara Crewe was in horrible disgrace, that Ermengarde was under punishment, and that Becky would have been packed out of the house before breakfast, but that a scullery - maid could not be dispensed with at once. The servants knew that she was allowed to stay because Miss Minchin could not easily find another creature helpless and humble enough to work like a bounden slave for so few shillings a week. The elder girls in the schoolroom knew that if Miss Minchin did not send Sara away it was for practical reasons of her own.

" She's growing so fast and learning such a lot, somehow, " said Jessie to Lavinia, " that she will be given classes soon, and Miss Minchin knows she will have to work for nothing. It was rather nasty of you, Lavvy, to tell about her having fun in the garret. How did you find it out? "

" I got it out of Lottie. She's such a baby she didn' t know she was telling me. There was nothing nasty at all in speaking to Miss Minchin. I felt it my duty. " - priggishly. " She was being deceitful. And it's ridiculous that she should look so grand, and be made so much of, in her rags and tatters! "

" What were they doing when Miss Minchin caught them? "

" Pretending some silly thing. Ermengarde had taken up her hamper to share with Sara and Becky. She never invites us to share things. Not that I care, but it's rather vulgar of her to share with servant - girls in attics. I wonder Miss Minchin didn' t turn Sara out - even if she does want her for a teacher. "

" If she was turned out where would she go? " inquired Jessie, a trifle anxiously.

" How do I know? " snapped Lavinia. " She' ll look rather queer when she comes into the schoolroom this morning, I should think - after what's happened. She had no dinner yesterday, and she's not to have any today. "

Jessie was not as ill - natured as she was silly. She picked up her book with a little jerk.

" Well, I think it's horrid, " she said. " They' ve no right to starve her to death. "

When Sara went into the kitchen that morning the cook looked askance at her, and so did the housemaids; but she passed them hurriedly. She had, in fact, overslept herself a little, and as Becky had done the same, neither had had time to see the other, and each had come downstairs in haste.

Sara went into the scullery. Becky was violently scrubbing a kettle, and was actually gurgling a little song in her throat. She looked up with a wildly elated face.

" It was there when I wakened, miss - the blanket, " she whispered excitedly. " It was as real as it was last night. "

" So was mine, " said Sara. " It is all there now - all of it. While I was dressing I ate some of the cold things we left. "

" Oh, laws! oh, laws! " Becky uttered the exclamation in a sort of rapturous groan, and ducked her head over her kettle just in time, as the cook came in from the kitchen.

Miss Minchin had expected to see in Sara, when she appeared in the schoolroom, very much what Lavinia had expected to see. Sara had always been an annoying puzzle to her, because severity never made her cry or look frightened. When she was scolded she stood still and listened politely with a grave face; when she was punished she performed her extra tasks or went without her meals, making no complaint or outward sign of rebellion. The very fact that she never made an impudent answer seemed to Miss Minchin a kind of impudence in itself. But after yesterday's deprivation of meals, the violent scene of last night, the prospect of hunger today, she must surely have broken down. It would be strange indeed if she did not come downstairs with pale cheeks and red eyes and an unhappy, humbled face.

Miss Minchin saw her for the first time when she entered the schoolroom to hear the little French class recite its lessons and superintend its exercises. And she came in with a springing step, color in her cheeks, and a smile hovering about the corners of her mouth. It was the most astonishing thing Miss Minchin had ever known. It gave her quite a shock. What was the child made of? What could such a thing mean? She called her at once to her desk.

" You do not look as if you realize that you are in disgrace, " she said. " Are you absolutely hardened? "

The truth is that when one is still a child - or even if one is grown up - and has been well fed, and has slept long and softly and warm; when one has gone to sleep in the midst of a fairy story, and has wakened to find it real, one cannot be unhappy or even look as if one were; and one could not, if one tried, keep a glow of joy out of one's eyes. Miss Minchin was almost struck dumb by the look of Sara's eyes when she lifted them and made her perfectly respectful answer.

" I beg your pardon, Miss Minchin, " she said; " I know that I am in disgrace. "

" Be good enough not to forget it and look as if you had come into a fortune. It is an impertinence. And remember you are to have no food to - day. "

" Yes, Miss Minchin, " Sara answered; but as she turned away her heart leaped with the memory of what yesterday had been. " If the Magic had not saved me just in time, " she thought, " how horrible it would have been! "

" She can' t be very hungry, " whispered Lavinia. " Just look at her. Perhaps she is pretending she has had a good breakfast " - with a spiteful laugh.

" She's different from other people, " said Jessie, watching Sara with her class. " Sometimes I' m a bit frightened of her. "

" Ridiculous thing! " ejaculated Lavinia.

All through the day the light was in Sara's face, and the color in her cheek. The servants cast puzzled glances at her, and whispered to each other, and Miss Amelia's small blue eyes wore an expression of bewilderment. What such an audacious look of well - being, under august displeasure, could mean she could not understand. It was, however, just like Sara's singular obstinate way. She was probably determined to brave the matter out.

One thing Sara had resolved upon, as she thought things over. The wonders which had happened must be kept a secret, if such a thing were possible. If Miss Minchin should choose to mount to the attic again, of course all would be discovered. But it did not seem likely that she would do so for some time at least, unless she was led by suspicion. Ermengarde and Lottie would be watched with such strictness that they would not dare to steal out of their beds again. Ermengarde could be told the story and trusted to keep it secret. If Lottie made any discoveries, she could be bound to secrecy also. Perhaps the Magic itself would help to hide its own marvels.

" But whatever happens, " Sara kept saying to herself all day - " WHATEVER happens, somewhere in the world there is a heavenly kind person who is my friend - my friend. If I never know who it is - if I never can even thank him - I shall never feel quite so lonely. Oh, the Magic was GOOD to me! "

If it was possible for weather to be worse than it had been the day before, it was worse this day - wetter, muddier, colder. There were more errands to be done, the cook was more irritable, and, knowing that Sara was in disgrace, she was more savage. But what does anything matter when one's Magic has just proved itself one's friend. Sara's supper of the night before had given her strength, she knew that she should sleep well and warmly, and, even though she had naturally begun to be hungry again before evening, she felt that she could bear it until breakfast - time on the following day, when her meals would surely be given to her again. It was quite late when she was at last allowed to go upstairs. She had been told to go into the schoolroom and study until ten o' clock, and she had become interested in her work, and remained over her books later.

When she reached the top flight of stairs and stood before the attic door, it must be confessed that her heart beat rather fast.

" Of course it MIGHT all have been taken away, " she whispered, trying to be brave. " It might only have been lent to me for just that one awful night. But it WAS lent to me - I had it. It was real. "

She pushed the door open and went in. Once inside, she gasped slightly, shut the door, and stood with her back against it, looking from side to side.

The Magic had been there again. It actually had, and it had done even more than before. The fire was blazing, in lovely leaping flames, more merrily than ever. A number of new things had been brought into the attic which so altered the look of it that if she had not been past doubting she would have rubbed her eyes. Upon the low table another supper stood - this time with cups and plates for Becky as well as herself; a piece of bright, heavy, strange embroidery covered the battered mantel, and on it some ornaments had been placed. All the bare, ugly things which could be covered with draperies had been concealed and made to look quite pretty. Some odd materials of rich colors had been fastened against the wall with fine, sharp tacks - so sharp that they could be pressed into the wood and plaster without hammering. Some brilliant fans were pinned up, and there were several large cushions, big and substantial enough to use as seats. A wooden box was covered with a rug, and some cushions lay on it, so that it wore quite the air of a sofa.

Sara slowly moved away from the door and simply sat down and looked and looked again.

" It is exactly like something fairy come true, " she said. " There isn' t the least difference. I feel as if I might wish for anything - diamonds or bags of gold - and they would appear! THAT wouldn' t be any stranger than this. Is this my garret? Am I the same cold, ragged, damp Sara? And to think I used to pretend and pretend and wish there were fairies! The one thing I always wanted was to see a fairy story come true. I am LIVING in a fairy story. I feel as if I might be a fairy myself, and able to turn things into anything else. "

She rose and knocked upon the wall for the prisoner in the next cell, and the prisoner came.

When she entered she almost dropped in a heap upon the floor. For a few seconds she quite lost her breath.

" Oh, laws! " she gasped, " Oh, laws, miss! " just as she had done in the scullery.

" You see, " said Sara.

On this night Becky sat on a cushion upon the hearth rug and had a cup and saucer of her own.

When Sara went to bed she found that she had a new thick mattress and big downy pillows. Her old mattress and pillow had been removed to Becky's bedstead, and, consequently, with these additions Becky had been supplied with unheard - of comfort.

" Where does it all come from? " Becky broke forth once. " Laws! who does it, miss? "

" Don' t let us even ASK, " said Sara. " If it were not that I want to say, ' Oh, thank you, ' I would rather not know. It makes it more beautiful. "

From that time life became more wonderful day by day. The fairy story continued. Almost every day something new was done. Some new comfort or ornament appeared each time Sara opened the door at night, until in a short time the attic was a beautiful little room full of all sorts of odd and luxurious things. The ugly walls were gradually entirely covered with pictures and draperies, ingenious pieces of folding furniture appeared, a book - shelf was hung up and filled with books, new comforts and conveniences appeared one by one, until there seemed nothing left to be desired. When Sara went downstairs in the morning, the remains of the supper were on the table; and when she returned to the attic in the evening, the magician had removed them and left another nice little meal. Miss Minchin was as harsh and insulting as ever, Miss Amelia as peevish, and the servants were as vulgar and rude. Sara was sent on errands in all weathers, and scolded and driven hither and thither; she was scarcely allowed to speak to Ermengarde and Lottie; Lavinia sneered at the increasing shabbiness of her clothes; and the other girls stared curiously at her when she appeared in the schoolroom. But what did it all matter while she was living in this wonderful mysterious story? It was more romantic and delightful than anything she had ever invented to comfort her starved young soul and save herself from despair. Sometimes, when she was scolded, she could scarcely keep from smiling.

" If you only knew! " she was saying to herself. " If you only knew! "

The comfort and happiness she enjoyed were making her stronger, and she had them always to look forward to. If she came home from her errands wet and tired and hungry, she knew she would soon be warm and well fed after she had climbed the stairs. During the hardest day she could occupy herself blissfully by thinking of what she should see when she opened the attic door, and wondering what new delight had been prepared for her. In a very short time she began to look less thin. Color came into her cheeks, and her eyes did not seem so much too big for her face.

" Sara Crewe looks wonderfully well, " Miss Minchin remarked disapprovingly to her sister.

" Yes, " answered poor, silly Miss Amelia. " She is absolutely fattening. She was beginning to look like a little starved crow. "

" Starved! " exclaimed Miss Minchin, angrily. " There was no reason why she should look starved. She always had plenty to eat! "

" Of - of course, " agreed Miss Amelia, humbly, alarmed to find that she had, as usual, said the wrong thing.

" There is something very disagreeable in seeing that sort of thing in a child of her age, " said Miss Minchin, with haughty vagueness.

" What - sort of thing? " Miss Amelia ventured.

" It might almost be called defiance, " answered Miss Minchin, feeling annoyed because she knew the thing she resented was nothing like defiance, and she did not know what other unpleasant term to use. " The spirit and will of any other child would have been entirely humbled and broken by - by the changes she has had to submit to. But, upon my word, she seems as little subdued as if - as if she were a princess. "

" Do you remember, " put in the unwise Miss Amelia, " What she said to you that day in the schoolroom about what you would do if you found out that she was - "

" No, I don' t, " said Miss Minchin. " Don' t talk nonsense. " But she remembered very clearly indeed.

Very naturally, even Becky was beginning to look plumper and less frightened. She could not help it. She had her share in the secret fairy story, too. She had two mattresses, two pillows, plenty of bed - covering, and every night a hot supper and a seat on the cushions by the fire. The Bastille had melted away, the prisoners no longer existed. Two comforted children sat in the midst of delights. Sometimes Sara read aloud from her books, sometimes she learned her own lessons, sometimes she sat and looked into the fire and tried to imagine who her friend could be, and wished she could say to him some of the things in her heart.

Then it came about that another wonderful thing happened. A man came to the door and left several parcels. All were addressed in large letters, " To the Little Girl in the right - hand attic. "

Sara herself was sent to open the door and took them in. She laid the two largest parcels on the hall table, and was looking at the address, when Miss Minchin came down the stairs and saw her.

" Take the things to the young lady to whom they belong, " she said severely. " Don' t stand there staring at them. "

" They belong to me, " answered Sara, quietly.

" To you? " exclaimed Miss Minchin. " What do you mean? "

" I don' t know where they come from, " said Sara, " But they are addressed to me. I sleep in the right - hand attic. Becky has the other one. "

Miss Minchin came to her side and looked at the parcels with an excited expression.

" What is in them? " she demanded.

" I don' t know, " replied Sara.

" Open them, " she ordered.

Sara did as she was told. When the packages were unfolded Miss Minchin's countenance wore suddenly a singular expression. What she saw was pretty and comfortable clothing - clothing of different kinds: shoes, stockings, and gloves, and a warm and beautiful coat. There were even a nice hat and an umbrella. They were all good and expensive things, and on the pocket of the coat was pinned a paper, on which were written these words: " To be worn every day. Will be replaced by others when necessary. "

Miss Minchin was quite agitated. This was an incident which suggested strange things to her sordid mind. Could it be that she had made a mistake, after all, and that the neglected child had some powerful though eccentric friend in the background - perhaps some previously unknown relation, who had suddenly traced her whereabouts, and chose to provide for her in this mysterious and fantastic way? Relations were sometimes very odd - particularly rich old bachelor uncles, who did not care for having children near them. A man of that sort might prefer to overlook his young relation's welfare at a distance. Such a person, however, would be sure to be crotchety and hot - tempered enough to be easily offended. It would not be very pleasant if there were such a one, and he should learn all the truth about the thin, shabby clothes, the scant food, and the hard work. She felt very queer indeed, and very uncertain, and she gave a side glance at Sara.

" Well, " she said, in a voice such as she had never used since the little girl lost her father, " Someone is very kind to you. As the things have been sent, and you are to have new ones when they are worn out, you may as well go and put them on and look respectable. After you are dressed you may come downstairs and learn your lessons in the schoolroom. You need not go out on any more errands today. "

About half an hour afterward, when the schoolroom door opened and Sara walked in, the entire seminary was struck dumb.

" My word! " ejaculated Jessie, jogging Lavinia's elbow. " Look at the Princess Sara! "

Everybody was looking, and when Lavinia looked she turned quite red.

It was the Princess Sara indeed. At least, since the days when she had been a princess, Sara had never looked as she did now. She did not seem the Sara they had seen come down the back stairs a few hours ago. She was dressed in the kind of frock Lavinia had been used to envying her the possession of. It was deep and warm in color, and beautifully made. Her slender feet looked as they had done when Jessie had admired them, and the hair, whose heavy locks had made her look rather like a Shetland pony when it fell loose about her small, odd face, was tied back with a ribbon.

" Perhaps someone has left her a fortune, " Jessie whispered. " I always thought something would happen to her. She is so queer. "

" Perhaps the diamond - mines have suddenly appeared again, " said Lavinia, scathingly. " Don' t please her by staring at her in that way, you silly thing. "

" Sara, " broke in Miss Minchin's deep voice, " Come and sit here. "

And while the whole schoolroom stared and pushed with elbows, and scarcely made any effort to conceal its excited curiosity, Sara went to her old seat of honor, and bent her head over her books.

That night, when she went to her room, after she and Becky had eaten their supper she sat and looked at the fire seriously for a long time.

" Are you making something up in your head, miss? " Becky inquired with respectful softness. When Sara sat in silence and looked into the coals with dreaming eyes it generally meant that she was making a new story. But this time she was not, and she shook her head.

" No, " she answered. " I am wondering what I ought to do. "

Becky stared - still respectfully. She was filled with something approaching reverence for everything Sara did and said.

" I can' t help thinking about my friend, " Sara explained. " If he wants to keep himself a secret, it would be rude to try and find out who he is. But I do so want him to know how thankful I am to him - and how happy he has made me. Anyone who is kind wants to know when people have been made happy. They care for that more than for being thanked. I wish - I do wish - "

She stopped short because her eyes at that instant fell upon something standing on a table in a corner. It was something she had found in the room when she came up to it only two days before. It was a little writing - case fitted with paper and envelopes and pens and ink.

" Oh, " she exclaimed, " Why did I not think of that before? "

She rose and went to the corner and brought the case back to the fire.

" I can write to him, " she said joyfully, " And leave it on the table. Then perhaps the person who takes the things away will take it, too. I won' t ask him anything. He won' t mind my thanking him, I feel sure. "

So she wrote a note. This is what she said:

I hope you will not think it is impolite that I should write this note to you when you wish to keep yourself a secret. Please believe I do not mean to be impolite or try to find out anything at all; only I want to thank you for being so kind to me - so heavenly kind - and making everything like a fairy story. I am so grateful to you, and I am so happy - and so is Becky. Becky feels just as thankful as I do - it is all just as beautiful and wonderful to her as it is to me. We used to be so lonely and cold and hungry and now - oh, just think what you have done for us! Please let me say just these words. It seems as if I OUGHT to say them. THANK you - THANK you - thank you!

THE LITTLE GIRL IN THE ATTIC.

The next morning she left this on the little table, and in the evening it had been taken away with the other things; so she knew the Magician had received it, and she was happier for the thought. She was reading one of her new books to Becky just before they went to their respective beds, when her attention was attracted by a sound at the skylight. When she looked up from her page she saw that Becky had heard the sound also, as she had turned her head to look and was listening rather nervously.

" Something's there, miss, " she whispered.

" Yes, " said Sara, slowly. " It sounds - rather like a cat - trying to get in. "

She left her chair and went to the skylight. It was a queer little sound she heard - like a soft scratching. She suddenly remembered something and laughed. She remembered a quaint little intruder who had made his way into the attic once before. She had seen him that very afternoon, sitting disconsolately on a table before a window in the Indian gentleman's house.

" Suppose, " she whispered in pleased excitement - " just suppose it was the monkey who had got away again. Oh, I wish it was! "

She climbed on a chair, very cautiously raised the skylight, and peeped out. It had been snowing all day, and on the snow, quite near her, crouched a tiny, shivering figure, whose small black face wrinkled itself piteously at sight of her.

" It is the monkey, " she cried out. " He has crept out of the Lascar's attic, and he saw the light. "

Becky ran to her side.

" Are you going to let him in, miss? " she said.

" Yes, " Sara answered joyfully. " It's too cold for monkeys to be out. They' re delicate. I' ll coax him in. "

She put a hand out delicately, speaking in a coaxing voice - as she spoke to the sparrows and to Melchisedec - as if she were some friendly little animal herself and lovingly understood their timid wildness.

" Come along, monkey darling, " she said. " I won' t hurt you. "

He knew she would not hurt him. He knew it before she laid her soft, caressing little paw on him and drew him toward her. He had felt human love in the slim brown hands of Ram Dass, and he felt it in hers. He let her lift him through the skylight, and when he found himself in her arms he cuddled up to her breast and took friendly hold of a piece of her hair, looking up into her face.

" Nice monkey! Nice monkey! " she crooned, kissing his funny head. " Oh, I do love little animal things. "

He was evidently glad to get to the fire, and when she sat down and held him on her knee he looked from her to Becky with mingled interest and appreciation.

" He IS plain - looking, miss, ain' t he? " said Becky.

" He looks like a very ugly baby, " laughed Sara. " I beg your pardon, monkey; but I' m glad you are not a baby. Your mother COULDN' T be proud of you, and no one would dare to say you looked like any of your relations. Oh, I do like you! "

She leaned back in her chair and reflected.

" Perhaps he's sorry he's so ugly, " she said, " and it's always on his mind. I wonder if he HAS a mind. Monkey, my love, have you a mind? "

But the monkey only put up a tiny paw and scratched his head.

" What shall you do with him? " Becky asked.

" I shall let him sleep with me tonight, and then take him back to the Indian gentleman tomorrow. I am sorry to take you back, monkey; but you must go. You ought to be fondest of your own family; and I' m not a REAL relation. "

And when she went to bed she made him a nest at her feet, and he curled up and slept there as if he were a baby and much pleased with his quarters.





CHAPTER ⅩⅦ　" IT IS THE CHILD !"


THE next afternoon three members of the Large Family sat in the Indian gentleman's library, doing their best to cheer him up. They had been allowed to come in to perform this office because he had specially invited them. He had been living in a state of suspense for some time, and today he was waiting for a certain event very anxiously. This event was the return of Mr. Carmichael from Moscow. His stay there had been prolonged from week to week. On his first arrival there, he had not been able satisfactorily to trace the family he had gone in search of. When he felt at last sure that he had found them and had gone to their house, he had been told that they were absent on a journey. His efforts to reach them had been unavailing, so he had decided to remain in Moscow until their return. Mr. Carrisford sat in his reclining chair, and Janet sat on the floor beside him. He was very fond of Janet. Nora had found a footstool, and Donald was astride the tiger's head which ornamented the rug made of the animal's skin. It must be owned that he was riding it rather violently.

" Don' t chirrup so loud, Donald, " Janet said. " When you come to cheer an ill person up you don' t cheer him up at the top of your voice. Perhaps cheering up is too loud, Mr. Carrisford? " turning to the Indian gentleman.

But he only patted her shoulder.

" No, it isn' t, " he answered. " And it keeps me from thinking too much. "

" I' m going to be quiet, " Donald shouted. " We' ll all be as quiet as mice. "

" Mice don' t make a noise like that, " said Janet.

Donald made a bridle of his handkerchief and bounced up and down on the tiger's head.

" A whole lot of mice might, " he said cheerfully. " A thousand mice might. "

" I don' t believe fifty thousand mice would, " said Janet, severely; " and we have to be as quiet as one mouse. "

Mr. Carrisford laughed and patted her shoulder again.

" Papa won' t be very long now, " she said. " May we talk about the lost little girl? "

" I don' t think I could talk much about anything else just now, " the Indian gentleman answered, knitting his forehead with a tired look.

" We like her so much, " said Nora. " We call her the little un - fairy princess. "

" Why? " the Indian gentleman inquired, because the fancies of the Large Family always made him forget things a little.

It was Janet who answered.

" It is because, though she is not exactly a fairy, she will be so rich when she is found that she will be like a princess in a fairy tale. We called her the fairy princess at first, but it didn' t quite suit. "

" Is it true, " said Nora, " that her papa gave all his money to a friend to put in a mine that had diamonds in it, and then the friend thought he had lost it all and ran away because he felt as if he was a robber? "

" But he wasn' t really, you know, " put in Janet, hastily.

The Indian gentleman took hold of her hand quickly.

" No, he wasn' t really, " he said.

" I am sorry for the friend, " Janet said; " I can' t help it. He didn' t mean to do it, and it would break his heart. I am sure it would break his heart. "

" You are an understanding little woman, Janet, " the Indian gentleman said, and he held her hand close.

" Did you tell Mr. Carrisford, " Donald shouted again, " about the little - girl - who - isn' t - a - beggar? Did you tell him she has new nice clothes? P' r' aps she's been found by somebody when she was lost. "

" There's a cab! " exclaimed Janet. " It's stopping before the door. It is papa! "

They all ran to the windows to look out.

" Yes, it's papa, " Donald proclaimed. " But there is no little girl. "

All three of them incontinently fled from the room and tumbled into the hall. It was in this way they always welcomed their father. They were to be heard jumping up and down, clapping their hands, and being caught up and kissed.

Mr. Carrisford made an effort to rise and sank back again into his chair.

" It is no use, " he said. " What a wreck I am! "

Mr. Carmichael's voice approached the door.

" No, children, " he was saying; " You may come in after I have talked to Mr. Carrisford. Go and play with Ram Dass. "

Then the door opened and he came in. He looked rosier than ever, and brought an atmosphere of freshness and health with him; but his eyes were disappointed and anxious as they met the invalid's look of eager question even as they grasped each other's hands.

" What news? " Mr. Carrisford asked. " The child the Russian people adopted? "

" She is not the child we are looking for, " was Mr. Carmichael's answer. " She is much younger than Captain Crewe's little girl. Her name is Emily Carew. I have seen and talked to her. The Russians were able to give me every detail. "

How wearied and miserable the Indian gentleman looked! His hand dropped from Mr. Carmichael's.

" Then the search has to be begun over again, " he said. " That is all. Please sit down. "

Mr. Carmichael took a seat. Somehow, he had gradually grown fond of this unhappy man. He was himself so well and happy, and so surrounded by cheerfulness and love, that desolation and broken health seemed pitifully unbearable things. If there had been the sound of just one gay little high - pitched voice in the house, it would have been so much less forlorn. And that a man should be compelled to carry about in his breast the thought that he had seemed to wrong and desert a child was not a thing one could face.

" Come, come, " he said in his cheery voice; " We' ll find her yet. "

" We must begin at once. No time must be lost, " Mr. Carrisford fretted. " Have you any new suggestion to make - any whatsoever? "

Mr. Carmichael felt rather restless, and he rose and began to pace the room with a thoughtful, though uncertain face.

" Well, perhaps, " he said. " I don' t know what it may be worth. The fact is, an idea occurred to me as I was thinking the thing over in the train on the journey from Dover. "

" What was it? If she is alive, she is somewhere. "

" Yes; she is SOMEWHERE. We have searched the schools in Paris. Let us give up Paris and begin in London. That was my idea - to search London. "

" There are schools enough in London, " said Mr. Carrisford. Then he slightly started, roused by a recollection. " By the way, there is one next door. "

" Then we will begin there. We cannot begin nearer than next door. "

" No, " said Carrisford. " There is a child there who interests me; but she is not a pupil. And she is a little dark, forlorn creature, as unlike poor Crewe as a child could be. "

Perhaps the Magic was at work again at that very moment - the beautiful Magic. It really seemed as if it might be so. What was it that brought Ram Dass into the room - even as his master spoke - salaaming respectfully, but with a scarcely concealed touch of excitement in his dark, flashing eyes?

" Sahib, " he said, " The child herself has come - the child the sahib felt pity for. She brings back the monkey who had again run away to her attic under the roof. I have asked that she remain. It was my thought that it would please the sahib to see and speak with her. "

" Who is she? " inquired Mr. Carmichael.

" God knows, " Mr. Carrisford answered. " She is the child I spoke of. A little drudge at the school. " He waved his hand to Ram Dass, and addressed him. " Yes, I should like to see her. Go and bring her in. " Then he turned to Mr. Carmichael. " While you have been away, " he explained, " I have been desperate. The days were so dark and long. Ram Dass told me of this child's miseries, and together we invented a romantic plan to help her. I suppose it was a childish thing to do; but it gave me something to plan and think of. Without the help of an agile, soft - footed Oriental like Ram Dass, however, it could not have been done. "

Then Sara came into the room. She carried the monkey in her arms, and he evidently did not intend to part from her, if it could be helped. He was clinging to her and chattering, and the interesting excitement of finding herself in the Indian gentleman's room had brought a flush to Sara's cheeks.

" Your monkey ran away again, " she said, in her pretty voice. " He came to my garret window last night, and I took him in because it was so cold. I would have brought him back if it had not been so late. I knew you were ill and might not like to be disturbed. "

The Indian gentleman's hollow eyes dwelt on her with curious interest.

" That was very thoughtful of you, " he said.

Sara looked toward Ram Dass, who stood near the door.

" Shall I give him to the Lascar? " she asked.

" How do you know he is a Lascar? " said the Indian gentleman, smiling a little.

" Oh, I know Lascars, " Sara said, handing over the reluctant monkey. " I was born in India. "

The Indian gentleman sat upright so suddenly, and with such a change of expression, that she was for a moment quite startled.

" You were born in India, " he exclaimed, " Were you? Come here. " And he held out his hand.

Sara went to him and laid her hand in his, as he seemed to want to take it. She stood still, and her green - gray eyes met his wonderingly. Something seemed to be the matter with him.

" You live next door? " he demanded.

" Yes; I live at Miss Minchin's seminary. "

" But you are not one of her pupils? "

A strange little smile hovered about Sara's mouth. She hesitated a moment.

" I don' t think I know exactly WHAT I am, " she replied.

" Why not? "

" At first I was a pupil, and a parlor boarder; but now - "

" You were a pupil! What are you now? "

The queer little sad smile was on Sara's lips again.

" I sleep in the attic, next to the scullery - maid, " she said. " I run errands for the cook - I do anything she tells me; and I teach the little ones their lessons. "

" Question her, Carmichael, " said Mr. Carrisford, sinking back as if he had lost his strength. " Question her; I cannot. "

The big, kind father of the Large Family knew how to question little girls. Sara realized how much practice he had had when he spoke to her in his nice, encouraging voice.

" What do you mean by' At first, ' my child? " he inquired.

" When I was first taken there by my papa. "

" Where is your papa? "

" He died, " said Sara, very quietly. " He lost all his money and there was none left for me. There was no one to take care of me or to pay Miss Minchin. "

" Carmichael! " the Indian gentleman cried out loudly; " Carmichael! "

" We must not frighten her, " Mr. Carmichael said aside to him in a quick, low voice; and he added aloud to Sara: " So you were sent up into the attic, and made into a little drudge. That was about it, wasn' t it? "

" There was no one to take care of me, " said Sara. " There was no money; I belong to nobody. "

" How did your father lose his money? " the Indian gentleman broke in breathlessly.

" He did not lose it himself, " Sara answered, wondering still more each moment. " He had a friend he was very fond of - he was very fond of him. It was his friend who took his money. He trusted his friend too much. "

The Indian gentleman's breath came more quickly.

" The friend might have MEANT to do no harm, " he said. " It might have happened through a mistake. "

Sara did not know how unrelenting her quiet young voice sounded as she answered. If she had known, she would surely have tried to soften it for the Indian gentleman's sake.

" The suffering was just as bad for my papa, " she said. " It killed him. "

" What was your father's name? " the Indian gentleman said. " Tell me. "

" His name was Ralph Crewe, " Sara answered, feeling startled. " Captain Crewe. He died in India. "

The haggard face contracted, and Ram Dass sprang to his master's side.

" Carmichael, " the invalid gasped, " It is the child - the child! "

For a moment Sara thought he was going to die. Ram Dass poured out drops from a bottle, and held them to his lips. Sara stood near, trembling a little. She looked in a bewildered way at Mr. Carmichael.

" What child am I? " she faltered.

" He was your father's friend, " Mr. Carmichael answered her. " Don' t be frightened. We have been looking for you for two years. "

Sara put her hand up to her forehead, and her mouth trembled. She spoke as if she were in a dream.

" And I was at Miss Minchin's all the while, " she half whispered. " Just on the other side of the wall. "





CHAPTER ⅩⅧ　" I TRIED NOT TO BE"


IT was pretty, comfortable Mrs. Carmichael who explained everything. She was sent for at once, and came across the square to take Sara into her warm arms and make clear to her all that had happened. The excitement of the totally unexpected discovery had been temporarily almost overpowering to Mr. Carrisford in his weak condition.

" Upon my word, " he said faintly to Mr. Carmichael, when it was suggested that the little girl should go into another room, " I feel as if I do not want to lose sight of her. "

" I will take care of her, " Janet said, " and mamma will come in a few minutes. " And it was Janet who led her away.

" We' re so glad you are found, " she said. " You don' t know how glad we are that you are found. "

Donald stood with his hands in his pockets, and gazed at Sara with reflecting and self - reproachful eyes.

" If I' d just asked what your name was when I gave you my sixpence, " he said, " you would have told me it was Sara Crewe, and then you would have been found in a minute. "

Then Mrs. Carmichael came in. She looked very much moved, and suddenly took Sara in her arms and kissed her.

" You look bewildered, poor child, " she said. " And it is not to be wondered at. "

Sara could only think of one thing.

" Was he, " she said, with a glance toward the closed door of the library - " Was HE the wicked friend? Oh, do tell me! "

Mrs. Carmichael was crying as she kissed her again. She felt as if she ought to be kissed very often because she had not been kissed for so long.

" He was not wicked, my dear, " she answered. " He did not really lose your papa's money. He only thought he had lost it; and because he loved him so much his grief made him so ill that for a time he was not in his right mind. He almost died of brain fever, and long before he began to recover your poor papa was dead. "

" And he did not know where to find me, " murmured Sara. " And I was so near. " Somehow, she could not forget that she had been so near.

" He believed you were in school in France, " Mrs. Carmichael explained. " And he was continually misled by false clues. He has looked for you everywhere. When he saw you pass by, looking so sad and neglected, he did not dream that you were his friend's poor child; but because you were a little girl, too, he was sorry for you, and wanted to make you happier. And he told Ram Dass to climb into your attic window and try to make you comfortable. "

Sara gave a start of joy; her whole look changed.

" Did Ram Dass bring the things? " she cried out; " Did he tell Ram Dass to do it? Did he make the dream that came true! "

" Yes, my dear - yes! He is kind and good, and he was sorry for you, for little lost Sara Crewe's sake. "

The library door opened and Mr. Carmichael appeared, calling Sara to him with a gesture.

" Mr. Carrisford is better already, " he said. " He wants you to come to him. "

Sara did not wait. When the Indian gentleman looked at her as she entered, he saw that her face was all alight.

She went and stood before his chair, with her hands clasped together against her breast.

" You sent the things to me, " she said, in a joyful emotional little voice - " the beautiful, beautiful things? YOU sent them! "

" Yes, poor, dear child, I did, " he answered her. He was weak and broken with long illness and trouble, but he looked at her with the look she remembered in her father's eyes - that look of loving her and wanting to take her in his arms. It made her kneel down by him, just as she used to kneel by her father when they were the dearest friends and lovers in the world.

" Then it is you who are my friend, " she said; " It is you who are my friend! " And she dropped her face on his thin hand and kissed it again and again.

" The man will be himself again in three weeks, " Mr. Carmichael said aside to his wife. " Look at his face already. "

In fact, he did look changed. Here was the " Little missus, " and he had new things to think of and plan for already. In the first place, there was Miss Minchin. She must be interviewed and told of the change which had taken place in the fortunes of her pupil.

Sara was not to return to the seminary at all. The Indian gentleman was very determined upon that point. She must remain where she was, and Mr. Carmichael should go and see Miss Minchin himself.

" I am glad I need not go back, " said Sara. " She will be very angry. She does not like me; though perhaps it is my fault, because I do not like her. "

But, oddly enough. Miss Minchin made it unnecessary for Mr. Carmichael to go to her, by actually coming in search of her pupil herself. She had wanted Sara for something, and on inquiry had heard an astonishing thing. One of the housemaids had seen her steal out of the area with something hidden under her cloak, and had also seen her go up the steps of the next door and enter the house.

" What does she mean! " cried Miss Minchin to Miss Amelia.

" I don' t know, I' m sure, sister, " answered Miss Amelia. " Unless she has made friends with him because he has lived in India. "

" It would be just like her to thrust herself upon him and try to gain his sympathies in some such impertinent fashion, " said Miss Minchin. " She must have been in the house two hours. I will not allow such presumption. I shall go and inquire into the matter, and apologize for her intrusion. "

Sara was sitting on a footstool close to Mr. Carrisford's knee, and listening to some of the many things he felt it necessary to try to explain to her, when Ram Dass announced the visitor's arrival.

Sara rose involuntarily, and became rather pale; but Mr. Carrisford saw that she stood quietly, and showed none of the ordinary signs of child terror.

Miss Minchin entered the room with a sternly dignified manner. She was correctly and well dressed, and rigidly polite.

" I am sorry to disturb Mr. Carrisford, " she said; " but I have explanations to make. I am Miss Minchin, the proprietress of the Young Ladies'seminary next door. "

The Indian gentleman looked at her for a moment in silent scrutiny. He was a man who had naturally a rather hot temper, and he did not wish it to get too much the better of him.

" So you are Miss Minchin? " he said.

" I am, sir. "

" In that case, " the Indian gentleman replied, " You have arrived at the right time. My solicitor, Mr. Carmichael, was just on the point of going to see you. "

Mr. Carmichael bowed slightly, and Miss Minchin looked from him to Mr. Carrisford in amazement.

" Your solicitor! " she said. " I do not understand. I have come here as a matter of duty. I have just discovered that you have been intruded upon through the forwardness of one of my pupils - a charity pupil. I came to explain that she intruded without my knowledge. " She turned upon Sara. " Go home at once, " she commanded indignantly. " You shall be severely punished. Go home at once. "

The Indian gentleman drew Sara to his side and patted her hand.

" She is not going. "

Miss Minchin felt rather as if she must be losing her senses.

" Not going! " she repeated.

" No, " said Mr. Carrisford. " She is not going home - if you give your house that name. Her home for the future will be with me. "

Miss Minchin fell back in amazed indignation.

" With YOU! With YOU, sir! What does this mean? "

" Kindly explain the matter, Carmichael, " said the Indian gentleman; " and get it over as quickly as possible. " And he made Sara sit down again, and held her hands in his - which was another trick of her papa's.

Then Mr. Carmichael explained - in the quiet, level - toned, steady manner of a man who knew his subject, and all its legal significance, which was a thing Miss Minchin understood as a business woman, and did not enjoy.

" Mr. Carrisford, madam, " he said, " was an intimate friend of the late Captain Crewe. He was his partner in certain large investments. The fortune which Captain Crewe supposed he had lost has been recovered, and is now in Mr. Carrisford's hands. "

" The fortune! " cried Miss Minchin; and she really lost color as she uttered the exclamation. " Sara's fortune! "

" It WILL be Sara's fortune, " replied Mr. Carmichael, rather coldly. " It is Sara's fortune now, in fact. Certain events have increased it enormously. The diamond - mines have retrieved themselves. "

" The diamond - mines! " Miss Minchin gasped out. If this was true, nothing so horrible, she felt, had ever happened to her since she was born.

" The diamond - mines, " Mr. Carmichael repeated, and he could not help adding, with a rather sly, unlawyer - like smile: " There are not many princesses, Miss Minchin, who are richer than your little charity pupil, Sara Crewe, will be. Mr. Carrisford has been searching for her for nearly two years; he has found her at last, and he will keep her. "

After which he asked Miss Minchin to sit down while he explained matters to her fully, and went into such detail as was necessary to make it quite clear to her that Sara's future was an assured one, and that what had seemed to be lost was to be restored to her tenfold; also, that she had in Mr. Carrisford a guardian as well as a friend.

Miss Minchin was not a clever woman, and in her excitement she was silly enough to make one desperate effort to regain what she could not help seeing she had lost through her worldly folly.

" He found her under my care, " she protested. " I have done everything for her. But for me she would have starved in the streets. "

Here the Indian gentleman lost his temper.

" As to starving in the streets, " he said, " She might have starved more comfortably there than in your attic. "

" Captain Crewe left her in my charge, " Miss Minchin argued. " She must return to it until she is of age. She can be a parlor boarder again. She must finish her education. The law will interfere in my behalf. "

" Come, come. Miss Minchin, " Mr. Carmichael interposed, " the law will do nothing of the sort. If Sara herself wishes to return to you, I dare say Mr. Carrisford might not refuse to allow it. But that rests with Sara. "

" Then, " said Miss Minchin, " I appeal to Sara. I have not spoiled you, perhaps, " she said awkwardly to the little girl; " But you know that your papa was pleased with your progress. And - ahem! - I have always been fond of you. "

Sara's green - gray eyes fixed themselves on her with the quiet, clear look Miss Minchin particularly disliked.

" Have YOU, Miss Minchin? " she said; " I did not know that. "

Miss Minchin reddened and drew herself up.

" You ought to have known it, " said she; " but children, unfortunately, never know what is best for them. Amelia and I always said you were the cleverest child in the school. Will you not do your duty to your poor papa and come home with me? "

Sara took a step toward her and stood still. She was thinking of the day when she had been told that she belonged to nobody, and was in danger of being turned into the street; she was thinking of the cold, hungry hours she had spent alone with Emily and Melchisedec in the attic. She looked Miss Minchin steadily in the face.

" You know why I will not go home with you, Miss Minchin, " she said; " You know quite well. "

A hot flush showed itself on Miss Minchin's hard, angry face.

" You will never see your companions again, " she began. " I will see that Ermengarde and Lottie are kept away - "

Mr. Carmichael stopped her with polite firmness.

" Excuse me, " he said; " She will see anyone she wishes to see. The parents of Miss Crewe's fellow - pupils are not likely to refuse her invitations to visit her at her guardian's house. Mr. Carrisford will attend to that. "

It must be confessed that even Miss Minchin flinched. This was worse than the eccentric bachelor uncle who might have a peppery temper and be easily offended at the treatment of his niece. A woman of sordid mind could easily believe that most people would not refuse to allow their children to remain friends with a little heiress of diamond - mines. And if Mr. Carrisford chose to tell certain of her patrons how unhappy Sara Crewe had been made, many unpleasant things might happen.

" You have not undertaken an easy charge, " she said to the Indian gentleman, as she turned to leave the room; " You will discover that very soon. The child is neither truthful nor grateful. I suppose " - to Sara - " that you feel now that you are a princess again. "

Sara looked down and flushed a little, because she thought her pet fancy might not be easy for strangers - even nice ones - to understand at first.

" I - TRIED not to be anything else, " she answered in a low voice - " even when I was coldest and hungriest - I tried not to be. "

" Now it will not be necessary to try, " said Miss Minchin, acidly, as Ram Dass salaamed her out of the room.

* * * * * *

She returned home and, going to her sitting - room, sent at once for Miss Amelia. She sat closeted with her all the rest of the afternoon, and it must be admitted that poor Miss Amelia passed through more than one bad quarter of an hour. She shed a good many tears, and mopped her eyes a good deal. One of her unfortunate remarks almost caused her sister to snap her head entirely off, but it resulted in an unusual manner.

" I' m not as clever as you, sister, " she said, " And I am always afraid to say things to you for fear of making you angry. Perhaps if I were not so timid it would be better for the school and for both of us. I must say I' ve often thought it would have been better if you had been less severe on Sara Crewe, and had seen that she was decently dressed and more comfortable. I know she was worked too hard for a child of her age, and I know she was only half fed - "

" How dare you say such a thing! " exclaimed Miss Minchin.

" I don' t know how I dare, " Miss Amelia answered, with a kind of reckless courage; " But now I' ve begun I may as well finish, whatever happens to me. The child was a clever child and a good child - and she would have paid you for any kindness you had shown her. But you didn' t show her any. The fact was, she was too clever for you, and you always disliked her for that reason. She used to see through us both - "

" Amelia! " gasped her infuriated elder, looking as if she would box her ears and knock her cap off, as she had often done to Becky.

But Miss Amelia's disappointment had made her hysterical enough not to care what occurred next.

" She did! She did! " she cried. " She saw through us both. She saw that you were a hard - hearted, worldly woman, and that I was a weak fool, and that we were both of us vulgar and mean enough to grovel on our knees before her money, and behave ill to her because it was taken from her - though she behaved herself like a little princess even when she was a beggar. She did - she did - like a little princess! " and her hysterics got the better of the poor woman, and she began to laugh and cry both at once, and rock herself backward and forward in such a way as made Miss Minchin stare aghast.

" And now you' ve lost her, " she cried wildly; " And some other school will get her and her money; and if she were like any other child she' d tell how she's been treated, and all our pupils would be taken away and we should be ruined. And it serves us right; but it serves you right more than it does me, for you are a hard woman, Maria Minchin - you' re a hard, selfish, worldly woman! "

And she was in danger of making so much noise with her hysterical chokes and gurgles that her sister was obliged to go to her and apply salts and sal volatile to quiet her, instead of pouring forth her indignation at her audacity.

And from that time forward, it may be mentioned, the elder Miss Minchin actually began to stand a little in awe of a sister who, while she looked so foolish, was evidently not quite so foolish as she looked, and might, consequently, break out and speak truths people did not want to hear.

That evening, when the pupils were gathered together before the fire in the schoolroom, as was their custom before going to bed, Ermengarde came in with a letter in her hand and a queer expression on her round face. It was queer because, while it was an expression of delighted excitement, it was combined with such amazement as seemed to belong to a kind of shock just received.

" What IS the matter? " cried two or three voices at once.

" Is it anything to do with the row that has been going on? " said Lavinia, eagerly. " There has been such a row in Miss Minchin's room, Miss Amelia has had something like hysterics and has had to go to bed. "

Ermengarde answered them slowly as if she were half stunned.

" I have just had this letter from Sara, " she said, holding it out to let them see what a long letter it was.

" From Sara! " Every voice joined in that exclamation.

" Where is she? " almost shrieked Jessie.

" Next door, " said Ermengarde, still slowly; " With the Indian gentleman. "

" Where? Where? Has she been sent away? Does Miss Minchin know? Was the row about that? Why did she write? Tell us! Tell us! "

There was a perfect babel, and Lottie began to cry plaintively.

Ermengarde answered them slowly as if she were half plunged out into what, at the moment, seemed the most important and self - explaining thing.

" There WERE diamond - mines, " she said stoutly; " there WERE! "

Open mouths and open eyes confronted her.

" They were real, " she hurried on. " It was all a mistake about them. Something happened for a time, and Mr. Carrisford thought they were ruined - "

" Who is Mr. Carrisford? " shouted Jessie.

" The Indian gentleman. And Captain Crewe thought so, too - and he died; and Mr. Carrisfoird had brain fever and ran away, and HE almost died. And he did not know where Sara was. And it turned out that there were millions and millions of diamonds in the mines; and half of them belong to Sara; and they belonged to her when she was living in the attic with no one but Melchisedec for a friend, and the cook ordering her about. And Mr. Carrisford found her this afternoon, and he has got her in his home - and she will never come back - and she will be more a princess than she ever was - a hundred and fifty thousand times more. And I am going to see her tomorrow afternoon. There! "

Even Miss Minchin herself could scarcely have controlled the uproar after this; and though she heard the noise, she did not try. She was not in the mood to face anything more than she was facing in her room, while Miss Amelia was weeping in bed. She knew that the news had penetrated the walls in some mysterious manner, and that every servant and every child would go to bed talking about it.

So until almost midnight the entire seminary, realizing somehow that all rules were laid aside, crowded round Ermengarde in the schoolroom and heard read and re - read the letter containing a story which was quite as wonderful as any Sara herself had ever invented, and which had the amazing charm of having happened to Sara herself and the mystic Indian gentleman in the very next house.

Becky, who had heard it also, managed to creep upstairs earlier than usual. She wanted to get away from people and go and look at the little magic room once more. She did not know what would happen to it. It was not likely that it would be left to Miss Minchin. It would be taken away, and the attic would be bare and empty again. Glad as she was for Sara's sake, she went up the last flight of stairs with a lump in her throat and tears blurring her sight. There would be no fire tonight, and no rosy lamp; no supper, and no princess sitting in the glow reading or telling stories - no princess!

She choked down a sob as she pushed the attic door open, and then she broke into a low cry.

The lamp was flushing the room, the fire was blazing, the supper was waiting; and Ram Dass was standing smiling into her startled face.

" Missee sahib remembered, " he said. " She told the sahib all. She wished you to know the good fortune which has befallen her. Behold a letter on the tray. She has written. She did not wish that you should go to sleep unhappy. The sahib commands you to come to him tomorrow. You are to be the attendant of missee sahib. Tonight I take these things back over the roof. "

And having said this with a beaming face, he made a little salaam and slipped through the skylight with an agile silentness of movement which showed Becky how easily he had done it before.





CHAPTER ⅩⅨ　"ANNE"


NEVER had such joy reigned in the nursery of the Large Family. Never had they dreamed of such delights as resulted from an intimate acquaintance with the little - girl - who - was - not - a - beggar. The mere fact of her sufferings and adventures made her a priceless possession. Everybody wanted to be told over and over again the things which had happened to her. When one was sitting by a warm fire in a big, glowing room, it was quite delightful to hear how cold it could be in an attic. It must be admitted that the attic was rather delighted in, and that its coldness and bareness quite sank into insignificance when Melchisedec was remembered, and one heard about the sparrows and things one could see if one climbed on the table and stuck one's head and shoulders out of the skylight.

Of course the thing loved best was the story of the banquet and the dream which was true. Sara told it for the first time the day after she had been found. Several members of the Large Family came to take tea with her, and as they sat or curled up on the hearth - rug she told the story in her own way, and the Indian gentleman listened and watched her. When she had finished she looked up at him and put her hand on his knee.

" That is my part, " she said. " Now won' t you tell your part of it, Uncle Tom? " He had asked her to call him always " Uncle Tom. " " I don' t know your part yet, and it must be beautiful. "

So he told them how, when he sat alone, ill and dull and irritable, Ram Dass had tried to distract him by describing the passers by, and there was one child who passed oftener than any one else; he had begun to be interested in her - partly perhaps because he was thinking a great deal of a little girl, and partly because Ram Dass had been able to relate the incident of his visit to the attic in chase of the monkey. He had described its cheerless look, and the bearing of the child, who seemed as if she was not of the class of those who were treated as drudges and servants. Bit by bit, Ram Dass had made discoveries concerning the wretchedness of her life. He had found out how easy a matter it was to climb across the few yards of roof to the skylight, and this fact had been the beginning of all that followed.

" Sahib, " he had said one day, " I could cross the slates and make the child a fire when she is out on some errand. When she returned, wet and cold, to find it blazing, she would think a magician had done it. "

The idea had been so fanciful that Mr. Carrisford's sad face had lighted with a smile, and Ram Dass had been so filled with rapture that he had enlarged upon it and explained to his master how simple it would be to accomplish numbers of other things. He had shown a childlike pleasure and invention, and the preparations for the carrying out of the plan had filled many a day with interest which would otherwise have dragged wearily. On the night of the frustrated banquet Ram Dass had kept watch, all his packages being in readiness in the attic which was his own; and the person who was to help him had waited with him, as interested as himself in the odd adventure. Ram Dass had been lying flat upon the slates, looking in at the skylight, when the banquet had come to its disastrous conclusion; he had been sure of the profoundness of Sara's wearied sleep; and then, with a dark lantern, he had crept into the room, while his companion had remained outside and handed the things to him. When Sara had stirred ever so faintly, Ram Dass had closed the lantern - slide and lain flat upon the floor. These and many other exciting things the children found out by asking a thousand questions.

" I am so glad, " Sara said. " I am so glad it was you who were my friend! "

There never were such friends as these two became. Somehow, they seemed to suit each other in a wonderful way. The Indian gentleman had never had a companion he liked quite as much as he liked Sara. In a month's time he was, as Mr. Carmichael had prophesied he would be, a new man. He was always amused and interested, and he began to find an actual pleasure in the possession of the wealth he had imagined that he loathed the burden of. There were so many charming things to plan for Sara.

There was a little joke between them that he was a magician, and it was one of his pleasures to invent things to surprise her. She found beautiful new flowers growing in her room, whimsical little gifts tucked under pillows, and once, as they sat together in the evening, they heard the scratch of a heavy paw on the door, and when Sara went to find out what it was, there stood a great dog - a splendid Russian boarhound - with a grand silver and gold collar bearing an inscription in raised letters. " I am Boris, " it read; " I serve the Princess Sara. "

There was nothing the Indian gentleman loved more than the recollection of the little princess in rags and tatters. The afternoons in which the Large Family, or Ermengarde and Lottie, gathered to rejoice together were very delightful. But the hours when Sara and the Indian gentleman sat alone and read or talked had a special charm of their own. During their passing many interesting things occurred.

One evening, Mr. Carrisford, looking up from his book, noticed that his companion had not stirred for some time, but sat gazing into the fire.

" What are you'supposing, 'sara? " he asked.

Sara looked up, with a bright color on her cheek.

" I was supposing, " she said; " I was remembering that hungry day, and a child I saw. "

" But there were a great many hungry days, " said the Indian gentleman, with rather a sad tone in his voice. " Which hungry day was it? "

" I forgot you didn' t know, " said Sara. " It was the day the dream came true. "

Then she told him the story of the bun - shop, and the fourpence she picked up out of the sloppy mud, and the child who was hungrier than herself. She told it quite simply, and in as few words as possible; but somehow the Indian gentleman found it necessary to shade his eyes with his hand and look down at the carpet.

" And I was supposing a kind of plan, " she said, when she had finished. " I was thinking I should like to do something. "

" What was it? " said Mr. Carrisford, in a low tone. " You may do anything you like to do, princess. "

" I was wondering, " rather hesitated Sara - " you know, you say I have so much money - I was wondering if I could go to see the bun - woman, and tell her that if, when hungry children - particularly on those dreadful days - come and sit on the steps, or look in at the window, she would just call them in and give them something to eat, she might send the bills to me. Could I do that? "

" You shall do it tomorrow morning, " said the Indian gentleman.

" Thank you, " said Sara. " You see, I know what it is to be hungry, and it is very hard when one cannot even PRETEND it away. "

" Yes, yes, my dear, " said the Indian gentleman. " Yes, yes, it must be. Try to forget it. Come and sit on this footstool near my knee, and only remember you are a princess. "

" Yes, " said Sara, smiling; " and I can give buns and bread to the populace. " And she went and sat on the stool, and the Indian gentleman( he used to like her to call him that, too, sometimes) drew her small dark head down upon his knee and stroked her hair.

The next morning. Miss Minchin, in looking out of her window, saw the thing she perhaps least enjoyed seeing. The Indian gentleman's carriage, with its tall horses, drew up before the door of the next house, and its owner and a little figure, warm with soft, rich furs, descended the steps to get into it. The little figure was a familiar one, and reminded Miss Minchin of days in the past. It was followed by another as familiar - the sight of which she found very irritating. It was Becky, who, in the character of delighted attendant, always accompanied her young mistress to her carriage, carrying wraps and belongings. Already Becky had a pink, round face.

A little later the carriage drew up before the door of the baker's shop, and its occupants got out, oddly enough, just as the bun - woman was putting a tray of smoking - hot buns into the window.

When Sara entered the shop the woman turned and looked at her, and, leaving the buns, came and stood behind the counter. For a moment she looked at Sara very hard indeed, and then her good - natured face lighted up.

" I' m sure that I remember you, miss, " she said. " And yet - "

" Yes, " said Sara; " Once you gave me six buns for fourpence, and - "

" And you gave five of' em to a beggar child, " the woman broke in on her. " I' ve always remembered it. I couldn' t make it out at first. " She turned round to the Indian gentleman and spoke her next words to him. " I beg your pardon, sir, but there's not many young people that notices a hungry face in that way; and I' ve thought of it many a time. Excuse the liberty, miss, " - to Sara - " But you look rosier and - well, better than you did that - that - "

" I am better, thank you, " said Sara. " And - I am much happier - and I have come to ask you to do something for me. "

" Me, miss! " exclaimed the bun - woman, smiling cheerfully. " Why, bless you! yes, miss. What can I do? "

And then Sara, leaning on the counter, made her little proposal concerning the dreadful days and the hungry waifs and the hot buns.

The woman watched her, and listened with an astonished face.

" Why, bless me! " she said again when she had heard it all; " It' ll be a pleasure to me to do it. I am a working - woman myself and cannot afford to do much on my own account, and there's sights of trouble on every side; but, if you' ll excuse me, I' m bound to say I' ve given away many a bit of bread since that wet afternoon, just along o' thinking of you - an' how wet an' cold you was, an' how hungry you looked; an' yet you gave away your hot buns as if you was a princess. "

The Indian gentleman smiled involuntarily at this, and Sara smiled a little, too, remembering what she had said to herself when she put the buns down on the ravenous child's ragged lap.

" She looked so hungry, " she said. " She was even hungrier than I was. "

" She was starving, " said the woman. " Many's the time she's told me of it since - how she sat there in the wet, and felt as if a wolf was a - tearing at her poor young insides. "

" Oh, have you seen her since then? " exclaimed Sara. " Do you know where she is? "

" Yes, I do, " answered the woman, smiling more good - naturedly than ever. " Why, she's in that there back room, miss, an' has been for a month; an' a decent, well - meanin' girl she's goin' to turn out, an'such a help to me in the shop an' in the kitchen as you' d scarce believe, knowin' how she's lived. "

She stepped to the door of the little back parlor and spoke; and the next minute a girl came out and followed her behind the counter. And actually it was the beggar - child, clean and neatly clothed, and looking as if she had not been hungry for a long time. She looked shy, but she had a nice face, now that she was no longer a savage, and the wild look had gone from her eyes. She knew Sara in an instant, and stood and looked at her as if she could never look enough.

" You see, " said the woman, " I told her to come when she was hungry, and when she' d come I' d give her odd jobs to do; an' I found she was willing, and somehow I got to like her; and the end of it was, I' ve given her a place an' a home, and she helps me, an' behaves well, an' is as thankful as a girl can be. Her name's Anne. She has no other. "

The children stood and looked at each other for a few minutes; and then Sara took her hand out of her muff and held it out across the counter, and Anne took it, and they looked straight into each other's eyes.

" I am so glad, " Sara said. " And I have just thought of something. Perhaps Mrs. Brown will let you be the one to give the buns and bread to the children. Perhaps you would like to do it because you know what it is to be hungry, too. "

" Yes, miss, " said the girl.

And, somehow, Sara felt as if she understood her, though she said so little, and only stood still and looked and looked after her as she went out of the shop with the Indian gentleman, and they got into the carriage and drove away.
