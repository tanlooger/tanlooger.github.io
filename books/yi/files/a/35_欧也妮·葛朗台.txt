内容简介


典型的守财奴葛朗台，“讲起理财的本领……是只老虎，是条巨蟒：他会躺在那里，蹲在那里，把俘虏打量个半天再扑上去，张开血盆大口的钱袋，倒进大堆的金银……”他象征近代人的上帝，法力无边而铁面无情的财神。为挣大钱，他盘剥外人；为省小钱，他刻薄家人。临死最后一句话，是叫女儿看守财产，将来到另一个世界上去向他交账。然而他一生积蓄的两千万家私，并无补于女儿的命运。黄金的枷锁与不幸的爱情，反而促成了欧也妮·葛朗台双重的悲剧。在巴尔扎克小说中，这是一部结构最古典的作品。文章简洁精练，淡雅自然，可算为最朴素的史诗。[1]

中产阶级的面目


某些内地城市里面，有些屋子看上去像最阴沉的修道院，最荒凉的旷野，最凄凉的废墟，令人悒郁不欢。修道院的静寂，旷野的枯燥，和废墟的衰败零落，也许这类屋子都有一点。里面的生活起居是那么幽静，要不是街上一有陌生的脚步声，窗口会突然探出一个脸孔像僧侣般的人，一动不动的，黯淡而冰冷的目光把生客瞪上一眼的话，外地客人可能把那些屋子当作没有人住的空屋。

索漠城里有一所住宅，外表就有这些凄凉的成分。一条起伏不平的街，直达城市高处的古堡，那所屋子便在街的尽头。现在已经不大有人来往的那条街，夏天热，冬天冷，有些地方暗得很，可是颇有些特点：小石子铺成的路面，传出清脆的回声，永远清洁，干燥；街面窄而多曲折；两旁的屋子非常幽静，坐落在城脚下，属于老城的部分。

上了三百年的屋子，虽是木造的，还很坚固，各种不同的格式别有风光，使索漠城的这一个区域特别引起考古学家与艺术家的注意。你走过这些屋子，不能不欣赏那些粗大的梁木，两头雕出古怪的形象，盖在大多数的底层上面，成为一条黝黑的浮雕。

有些地方，屋子的横木盖着石板，在不大结实的墙上勾勒出蓝色的图案，木料支架的屋顶，年深月久，往下弯了；日晒雨淋，椽子已经腐烂，翘曲。有些地方，露出破旧黝黑的窗槛，细巧的雕刻已经看不大清，穷苦的女工放上一盆石竹或蔷薇，窗槛似乎就承受不住那棕色的瓦盆。再往前走，有的门上钉着粗大的钉子，我们的祖先异想天开地刻上些奇形怪状的文字，意义是永远没法知道的了；或者是一个新教徒在此表明自己的信仰，或者是一个旧教徒为反对新教而诅咒亨利四世。也有一般布尔乔亚刻些徽号，表示他们是旧乡绅，掌握过当地的行政。这一切中间就有整部法兰西历史的影子。一边是墙壁粉得很粗糙的、摇摇欲坠的屋子，还是工匠卖弄手艺的遗物；贴邻便是一座乡绅的住宅，半圆形门框上的贵族徽号，受过了一七八九年以来历次革命的摧残，还看得出遗迹。

这条街上，做买卖的底层既不是小铺子，也不是大商店，喜欢中世纪文物的人，在此可以遇到一派朴素简陋的气象，完全像我们上代里的习艺工场[1]。宽大低矮的店堂，没有铺面，没有摆在廊下的货摊，没有橱窗，可是很深，黑洞洞的，里里外外没有一点儿装潢。满板的大门分作上下两截，简陋地钉了铁皮；上半截往里打开，下半截装有弹簧的门铃，老是有人开进开出。门旁半人高的墙上，一排厚实的护窗板，白天卸落，夜晚装上，外加铁闩好落锁。这间地窖式的潮湿的屋子，就靠大门的上半截或者窗洞与屋顶之间的空间，透进一些空气与阳光。半人高的墙壁下面，是陈列商品的位置。招徕顾客的玩意儿，这儿是绝对没有的。货色的种类要看铺子的性质：或者摆着两三桶盐和鳕鱼，或者是几捆帆布与绳索，楼板的椽木上挂着黄铜索，靠墙放一排桶箍，再不然架上放些布匹。

你进门吧，一个年轻漂亮的姑娘，干干净净的，戴着白围巾，手臂通红，立刻放下编织物，叫唤她的父亲或母亲来招呼你，也许是两个铜子也许是两万法郎的买卖，对你或者冷淡，或者殷勤，或者傲慢，那得看店主的性格了。

你也可看到一个做酒桶木材的商人，两只大拇指绕来绕去的，坐在门口跟邻居谈天。表面上他只有些起码的酒瓶架或两三捆薄板；但是安育地区所有的箍桶匠，都是向他码头上存货充足的工场购料的。他知道如果葡萄的收成好，他能卖掉多少桶板，估计的准确最多是一两块板上下。一天的好太阳叫他发财，一场雨水叫他亏本：酒桶的市价，一个上午可以从十一法郎跌到六法郎。

这个地方像都兰区域一样，市面是由天气做主的。种葡萄的，有田产的，木材商，箍桶匠，旅店主人，船夫，都眼巴巴地盼望太阳；晚上睡觉，就怕明朝起来听说隔夜结了冰；他们怕风，怕雨，怕旱，一忽儿要雨水，一忽儿要天时转暖，一忽儿又要满天的云。在天公与尘世的利益之间，争执是没得完的。晴雨表能够轮流地叫人愁，叫人笑，叫人高兴。

这条街从前是索漠城的大街，从这一头到那一头，“黄金一般的好天气”这句话，对每份人家都代表一个收入的数目。而且每个人会对邻居说：“是啊，天上落金子下来了。”因为他们知道一道阳光和一场时雨带来多少利益。在天气美好的季节，到了星期六中午，就没法买到一个铜子的东西。做生意的人也有一个葡萄园，一方小园地，全要下乡去忙他两天。买进，卖出，赚头，一切都是预先计算好的，生意人尽可以花大半日的工夫打哈哈，说长道短，刺探旁人的私事。某家的主妇买了一只竹鸡，邻居就要问她的丈夫是否煮得恰到好处。一个年轻的姑娘从窗口探出头来，绝没有办法不让所有的闲人瞧见。因此大家的良心是露天的，那些无从窥测的、又暗又静的屋子，藏不了什么秘密。

一般人差不多老在露天过活：每对夫妇坐在大门口，在那里吃中饭，吃晚饭，吵架拌嘴。街上的行人，没有一个不经过他们研究的。所以从前一个外乡人到内地，免不了到处给人家取笑。许多有趣的故事便是这样来的，安越人的爱寻开心也是这样出名的，因为编这一类的市井笑料是他们的拿手好戏。

早先本地的乡绅全住在这条街上，街的高头都是古城里的老宅子，世道人心都还朴实的时代——这种古风现在是一天天地消灭了——的遗物。我们这个故事中的那所凄凉的屋子，就是其中之一。

古色古香的街上，连偶然遇到的小事都足以唤起你的回忆，全部的气息使你不由自主地沉入遐想。拐弯抹角地走过去，你可以看到一处黑魆魆的凹进去的地方，葛朗台府上的大门便藏在这凹坑中间。

在内地把一个人的家称作府上是有分量的；不知道葛朗台先生的身世，就没法掂出这称呼的分量。

葛朗台先生在索漠城的名望，自有它的前因后果，那是从没在内地耽留过的人不能完全了解的。葛朗台先生，有些人还称他作葛朗台老头，可是这样称呼他的老人越来越少了。他在一七八九年上是一个很富裕的箍桶匠，识得字，能写能算。共和政府在索漠地区标卖教会产业的时候，他正好四十岁，才娶了一个有钱的木板商的女儿。他拿自己的现款和女人的陪嫁，凑成两千金路易，跑到区公所。标卖监督官是一个强凶霸道的共和党人，葛朗台把丈人给的四百路易往他那里一送，就三钱不值两钱地，即使不能算正当，至少是合法地买到了区里最好的葡萄园、一座老修道院和几块分种田。

索漠的市民很少有革命气息，在他们眼里，葛朗台老头是一个激烈的家伙，前进分子，共和党人，关切新潮流的人物；其实箍桶匠只关心葡萄园。上面派他当索漠区的行政委员，于是地方上的政治与商业都受到他温和的影响。

在政治方面，他包庇从前的贵族，想尽方法使流亡乡绅的产业不致被公家标卖；商业方面，他向革命军队承包了一两千桶白酒，代价是把某个女修道院上好的草原，本来留作最后一批标卖的产业，弄到了手。

拿破仑执政的时代，好家伙葛朗台做了区长，把地方上的公事应付得很好，可是他葡萄的收获更好；拿破仑称帝的时候，他变了光杆儿的葛朗台先生。拿破仑不喜欢共和党人，另外派了一个乡绅兼大地主，一个后来晋封为男爵的人来代替葛朗台，因为他有红帽子嫌疑。葛朗台丢掉区长的荣衔，毫不惋惜。在他任内，为了本城的利益，已经造好几条出色的公路直达他的产业。他的房产与地产登记的时候，占了不少便宜，只交很轻的税。自从他各处的庄园登记之后，靠他不断地经营，他的葡萄园变成地方上的顶尖儿，这个专门的形容词是说这种园里的葡萄能够酿成极品的好酒。总而言之，他简直有资格得荣誉团的勋章。

免职的事发生在一八〇六年。那时葛朗台五十七岁，他的女人三十六，他们的独养女儿才十岁。

大概是老天看见他丢了官，想安慰安慰他吧，这一年上葛朗台接连得了三笔遗产，先是他丈母特·拉·古地尼埃太太的，接着是太太的外公特·拉·裴德里埃先生的，最后是葛朗台自己的外婆香蒂埃太太的：这些遗产数目之大，没有一个人知道。三个老人爱钱如命，一生一世都在积聚金钱，以便私下里摩挲把玩。特·拉·裴德里埃老先生把放债叫作挥霍，觉得对黄金看上几眼比放高利贷还实惠。所以他们积蓄的多少，索漠人只能以看得见的收入估计。

于是葛朗台先生得了新的贵族头衔，那是尽管我们爱讲平等也消灭不了的，他成为一州里“纳税最多”的人物。他的葡萄园有一百阿尔邦[2]，收成好的年份可以出产七八百桶酒。他还有十三处分种田，一座老修道院，修院的窗子、门洞、彩色玻璃，一齐给他从外面堵死了，既可不付捐税，又可保存那些东西。此外还有一百二十七阿尔邦的草原，上面的三千株白杨是一七九三年种下的。他住的屋子也是自己的产业。

这是他看得见的家私。至于他现金的数目，只有两个人知道一个大概。一个是公证人克罗旭，替葛朗台放债的；另外一个是台·格拉桑，索漠城中最有钱的银行家。葛朗台认为合适的时候跟他暗中合作一下，分些好处。在内地要得人信任，要挣家业，行事非机密不可；老克罗旭与台·格拉桑虽然机密透顶，仍免不了当众对葛朗台毕恭毕敬，使旁观的人看出前任区长的资力何等雄厚。

索漠城里个个人相信葛朗台家里有一个私库，一个堆满金路易的秘窟，说他半夜里瞧着累累的黄金，快乐得无可形容。一般吝啬鬼认为这是千真万确的事，因为看见那好家伙连眼睛都是黄澄澄的，染上了金子的光彩。一个靠资金赚惯大利钱的人，像色鬼、赌徒或帮闲的清客一样，眼风自有那种说不出的神气，一派躲躲闪闪的、馋痨的、神秘的模样，决计瞒不过他的同道。凡是对什么东西着了迷的人，这些暗号无异帮派里的切口。

葛朗台先生从来不欠人家什么，又是老箍桶匠，又是种葡萄的老手，什么时候需要为自己的收成准备一千只桶，什么时候只要五百只桶，他预算得像天文学家一样准确。投机事业从没失败过一次，酒桶的市价比酒还贵的时候，他老是有酒桶出卖。他能够把酒藏起来，等每桶涨到两百法郎才抛出去，一般小地主却早已在一百法郎的时候脱手了。这样一个人物当然博得大家的敬重。那有名的一八一一年的收成，他乖乖地囤在家里，一点一滴地慢慢卖出去，挣了二十四万多法郎。讲起理财的本领，葛朗台先生是只老虎，是条巨蟒：他会躺在那里，蹲在那里，把俘虏打量个半天再扑上去，张开血盆大口的钱袋，倒进大堆的金银，然后安安宁宁地去睡觉，好像一条蛇吃饱了东西，不动声色，冷静非凡，什么事情都按部就班的。

他走过的时候，没有一个人看见了不觉得又钦佩，又敬重，又害怕。索漠城中，不是个个人都给他钢铁般的利爪干净利落地抓过一下的吗？某人为了买田，从克罗旭那里弄到一笔借款，利率要一分一，某人拿期票向台·格拉桑贴现，给先扣了一大笔利息。市场上，或是夜晚的闲谈中间，不提到葛朗台先生大名的日子很少。有些人认为，这个种葡萄老头的财富简直是地方上的一宝，值得夸耀。不少做买卖的，开旅店的，得意扬扬地对外客说：

“嘿，先生，上百万的咱们有两三家；可是葛朗台先生哪，连他自己也不知道究竟有多少家私！”

一八一六年的时候，索漠城里顶会计算的人，估计那好家伙的地产大概值到四百万；但在一七九三到一八一七年中间，平均每年的收入该有十万法郎，由此推算，他所有的现金大约和不动产的价值差不多。因此，打完了一场牌，或是谈了一会儿葡萄的情形，提到葛朗台的时候，一般自作聪明的人就说：“葛朗台老头吗？……总该有五六百万吧。”要是克罗旭或台·格拉桑听到了，就会说：

“你好厉害，我倒从来不知道他的总数呢！”

遇到什么巴黎客人提到洛岂尔特或拉斐德那般大银行家，索漠人就要问，他们是不是跟葛朗台先生一样有钱。如果巴黎人付之一笑，回答说是的，他们便把脑袋一侧，互相瞪着眼，满脸不相信的神气。

偌大一笔财产把这个富翁的行为都镀了金。假使他的生活起居本来有什么可笑、给人家当话柄的地方，那些话柄也早已消灭得无影无踪了。葛朗台的一举一动都像是钦定的，到处行得通；他的说话，衣着，姿势，瞪眼睛，都是地方上的金科玉律；大家把他仔细研究，像自然科学家要把动物的本能研究出它的作用似的，终于发现他最琐屑的动作，也有深邃而不可言传的智慧。譬如，人家说：

“今年冬天一定很冷，葛朗台老头已经戴起皮手套了：咱们该收割葡萄了吧。”

或者说：

“葛朗台老头买了许多桶板，今年的酒一定不少的。”

葛朗台先生从来不买肉，不买面包。每个星期，那些佃户给他送来一份足够的食物：阉鸡，母鸡，鸡子，牛油，麦子，都是抵租的。他有一所磨坊租给人家，磨坊司务除了缴付租金以外，还得亲自来拿麦子去磨，再把面粉跟麸皮送回来。他的独一无二的老妈子，叫作长脚拿侬的，虽然上了年纪，还是每星期六替他做面包。房客之中有种菜的，葛朗台便派定他们供应菜蔬。至于水果，收获之多，可以大部分出售。烧火炉用的木材，是把田地四周的篱垣或烂了一半的老树砍下来，由佃户锯成一段一段的，用小车装进城，他们还有心巴结，替他送进柴房，讨得几声谢。他的开支，据人家知道的，只有教堂里座椅的租费，圣餐费，太太和女儿的衣着，家里的灯烛，拿侬的工钱，锅子的镀锡，国家的赋税，庄园的修理和种植的费用。他新近买了六百阿尔邦的一片树林，托一个近邻照顾，答应给一些津贴。自从他置了这个产业之后，他才吃野味。

这家伙动作非常简单，说话不多，发表意见总是用柔和的声音、简短的句子，搬弄一些老生常谈。从他出头露面的大革命时代起，逢到要长篇大论说一番，或者跟人家讨论什么，他便马上结结巴巴的，弄得对方头昏脑涨。这种口齿不清，理路不明，前言不对后语，以及废话连篇把他的思想弄糊涂了的情形，人家当作是他缺少教育，其实完全是假装的；等会故事中有些情节，就足以解释明白。而且逢到要应付，要解决什么生活上或买卖上的难题，他就搬出四句口诀，像代数公式一样准确，叫作：“我不知道，我不能够，我不愿意，慢慢瞧吧。”

他从来不说一声是或不是，也从来不把黑笔落在白纸上。人家跟他说话，他冷冷地听着，右手托着下巴颏儿，肘子靠在左手背上；无论什么事，他一朝拿定了主意，就永远不变。一点点儿小生意，他也得盘算半天。经过一番钩心斗角的谈话之后，对方自以为心中的秘密保守得密不透风，其实早已吐出了真话。他却回答道：

“我没有跟太太商量过，什么都不能决定。”

给他压得像奴隶般的太太，却是他生意上最方便的遮身牌。他从来不到别人家里去，不吃人家，也不请人家；他没有一点儿声响，似乎什么都要节省，连动作在内。因为没有一刻不尊重旁人的主权，他绝对不动人家的东西。

可是，尽管他声音柔和，态度持重，仍不免露出箍桶匠的谈吐与习惯，尤其在家里，不像在旁的地方那么顾忌。

至于体格，他身高五尺，臃肿，横阔，腿肚子的圆周有一尺，多节的膝盖骨，宽大的肩膀；脸是圆的，乌油油的，有痘瘢；下巴笔直，嘴唇没有一点儿曲线，牙齿雪白；冷静的眼睛好像要吃人，是一般所谓的蛇眼；脑门上布满褶皱，一块块隆起的肉颇有些奥妙；青年人不知轻重，背后开葛朗台先生玩笑，把他黄而灰白的头发叫作金子里掺白银；鼻尖肥大，顶着一颗布满血筋的肉瘤，一般人不无理由地说，这颗瘤里全是刁钻促狭的玩意儿。这副脸相显出他那种阴险的狡猾，显出他有计划的诚实，显出他的自私自利，所有的感情都集中在吝啬的乐趣和他唯一真正关切的独养女儿欧也妮身上。而且姿势、举动、走路的功架，他身上的一切都表示他只相信自己，这是生意上左右逢源养成的习惯。所以表面上虽然性情和易，很好对付，骨子里他却硬似铁石。

他老是同样的装束，从一七九一年以来始终是那身打扮。笨重的鞋子，鞋带也是皮做的；四季都穿一双呢袜，一条栗色的粗呢短裤，用银箍在膝盖下面扣紧；上身穿一件方襟的闪光丝绒背心，颜色一忽儿黄一忽儿古铜色；外面罩一件衣裾宽大的栗色外套，戴一条黑领带，一顶阔边帽子。他的手套跟警察的一样结实，要用到一年零八个月，为保持清洁起见，他有一个一定的手势，把手套放在帽子边缘上一定的位置。

关于这个人物，索漠人所知道的不过这一些。

城里的居民有资格在他家出入的只有六个。前三个中顶重要的是克罗旭先生的侄子。这个年轻人，自从当了索漠初级裁判所所长之后，在本姓克罗旭之上又加了一个篷风的姓氏，并且极力想叫篷风出名。他的签名已经变作克·特·篷风了。倘使有什么冒失的律师仍旧称他“克罗旭先生”，包管在出庭的时候要后悔他的糊涂。凡是称“所长先生”的，就可博得法官的庇护。对于称他“特·篷风先生”的马屁鬼，他更不惜满面春风地报以微笑。所长先生三十三岁，有一处名叫篷风的田庄，每年有七千法郎进款；他还在那里等两个叔父的遗产，一个是克罗旭公证人，一个是克罗旭神父，属于都尔城圣马丁大教堂的教士会的；据说这两人都相当有钱。三位克罗旭，房族既多，城里的亲戚也有一二十家，俨然结成一个党，好像从前佛罗伦萨的那些美第奇一样；而且正如美第奇有巴齐一族跟他们对垒似的，克罗旭也有他们的敌党。

台·格拉桑太太有一个二十三岁的儿子。她很热心地来陪葛朗台太太打牌，希望她亲爱的阿道夫能够和欧也妮小姐结婚。银行家台·格拉桑先生，拿出全副精神从旁协助，对吝啬的老头儿不断地暗中帮忙，逢到攸关大局的紧要关头，从来不落人后。这三位台·格拉桑也有他们的帮手、房族和忠实的盟友。

在克罗旭方面，神父是智囊，加上那个当公证人的兄弟做后援，他竭力跟银行家太太竞争，想把葛朗台的大笔遗产留给自己的侄儿。克罗旭和台·格拉桑两家暗中为争夺欧也妮的斗法，成为索漠城中大家小户热心关切的题目。葛朗台小姐将来嫁给谁呢？所长先生呢还是阿道夫·台·格拉桑？

对于这个问题，有的人的答案是两个都不会到手。据他们说，老箍桶匠野心勃勃，想找一个贵族院议员做女婿，凭他岁收三十万法郎的陪嫁，谁还计较葛朗台过去、现在、将来的那些酒桶？另外一批人却回答说，台·格拉桑是世家，极有钱，阿道夫又是一个俊俏后生，这样一门亲事，一定能叫出身低微，索漠城里都眼见拿过斧头凿子，而且还当过革命党的人心满意足，除非他夹袋里有什么教皇的侄子之流。可是老于世故的人提醒你说，克罗旭·特·篷风先生随时可以在葛朗台家进出，而他的敌手只能在星期日受招待。有的人认为，台·格拉桑太太跟葛朗台家的太太们，比克罗旭一家接近得多，久而久之，一定能说动她们，达到她的目的。有的人却认为克罗旭神父的花言巧语是天下第一，拿女人跟出家人对抗，正好势均力敌。所以索漠城中有一个才子说：

“他们正是旗鼓相当，各有一手。”

据地方上熟知内幕的老辈的看法，像葛朗台那么精明的人家，绝不肯把家私落在外人手里。索漠的葛朗台还有一个兄弟在巴黎，非常有钱的酒商；欧也妮小姐将来是嫁给巴黎葛朗台的儿子的。对这种意见，克罗旭和台·格拉桑两家的党羽都表示异议，说：

“一则两兄弟三十年来没有见过两次面；二则巴黎的葛朗台先生对儿子的期望大得很。他自己是巴黎某区的区长，兼国会议员、禁卫军旅长、商事裁判所推事，自称为跟拿破仑提拔的某公爵有姻亲，早已不承认索漠的葛朗台是本家。”

周围七八十里，甚至在安越到勃洛阿的驿车里，都在谈到这个有钱的独养女儿，七嘴八舌，议论纷纷，当然是应有之事。

一八一七年初，有一桩事情使克罗旭党彰明较著地占了台·格拉桑党上风。法劳丰田产素来以美丽的别庄、园亭、小溪、池塘、森林出名，值到三百万法郎。年轻的法劳丰侯爵急需现款，不得不把这块产业出卖。克罗旭公证人，克罗旭所长，克罗旭神父，再加上他们的党羽，居然把侯爵分段出售的意思打消了。公证人告诉他，分成小块的标卖，势必要跟投标落选的人打不知多少场官司，才能拿到田价；还不如整块儿让给葛朗台先生，既买得起，又能付现钱。公证人这番话把卖主说服了，做成一桩特别便宜的好买卖。侯爵的那块良田美产，就这样地给张罗着送到了葛朗台嘴里。他出乎索漠人意料之外，竟打了些折扣当场把田价付清。这件新闻一直传播到南德与奥莱昂。

葛朗台先生搭着人家回乡的小车，到别庄上视察，以主人的身份对产业瞥了一眼。回到城里，觉得这一次的投资足足有五厘利，他又马上得了一个好主意，预备把全部的田产和法劳丰并在一起。随后，他要把差不多出空了的金库重新填满，决意把他的树木、森林，一齐砍下，再把草原上的白杨也出卖。

葛朗台先生的府上这个称呼，现在你们该明白它的分量了吧。那是一所灰暗、阴森、静寂的屋子，坐落在城区上部，靠着坍毁的城脚。

门框的穹隆与两根支柱，像正屋一样用的混凝土，洛阿河岸特产的一种白石，质地松软，用不到两百年以上的。寒暑的酷烈，把柱头、门洞、门顶，都磨出无数古怪的洞眼，像法国建筑的那种虫蛀样儿，也有几分像监狱的大门。门顶上面，有一长条硬石刻成的浮雕，代表四季的形象已经剥蚀，变黑。浮雕的础石突出在外面，横七竖八地长着野草，黄色的苦菊、五爪龙、旋覆花、车前草，一株小小的樱桃树已经长得很高了。

褐色的大门是独幅的橡木做的，没有油水，到处开裂，看上去很单薄，其实很坚固，因为有一排对花的钉子支持。一边的门上有扇小门，中间开一个小方洞，装了铁栅，排得很密的铁梗锈得发红，铁栅上挂着一个环，上面吊一个敲门用的铁锤，正好敲在一颗奇形怪状的大钉子上。铁锤是长方形的，像古时的钟锤，又像一个肥大的惊叹号；一个玩古董的人仔细打量之下，可以发现锤子当初是一个小丑的形状，但是年深月久，已经磨平了。

那个小铁栅，当初在宗教战争的时代，原是预备给屋内的人探望来客的。现在喜欢东张西望的人，可以从铁栅中间望到黑魆魆的半绿不绿的环洞，环洞底上有几级七零八落的磴级，通上花园：厚实而潮湿的围墙，到处渗出水迹，生满垂头丧气的杂树，倒也另有一番景致。这片墙原是城墙的一部分，邻近人家都利用它布置花园。

楼下最重要的房间是那间“堂屋”，从大门内的环洞进出的。在安育、都兰、裴里各地的小城中间，一间堂屋的重要，外方人是不大懂得的。它同时是穿堂、客厅、书房、上房、饭厅；它是日常生活的中心，全家公用的起居室。本区的理发匠替葛朗台先生一年理两次发是在这里，佃户、教士、县长、磨坊伙计上门的时候，也是在这间屋里。室内铺着地板，有两扇临街的窗；古式嵌线的灰色护壁板从上铺到下，顶上的梁木都露在外面，也漆成灰色；梁木中间的楼板涂着白粉，已经发黄了。

壁炉架上面挂着一面耀出青光的镜子，两旁的边划成斜面，显出玻璃的厚度，一丝丝的闪光照在哥特式的镂花钢框上。壁炉架是粗糙的白石面子，摆着一座黄铜的老钟，壳子上有螺钿嵌成的图案。左右放两盏黄铜的两用烛台，座子是铜镶边的蓝色大理石，矗立着好几枝玫瑰花瓣形的灯芯盘；把这些盘子拿掉，座子又可成为一个单独的烛台，在平常日子应用。

古式的座椅，花绸面子上织着拉封丹的寓言，但不是博学之士，休想认出它们的内容：颜色褪尽，到处是补丁，人物已经看不清楚。四边壁角里放着三角形的酒橱，顶上有几格放零星小件的搁板，全是油腻。两扇窗子中间的板壁下面，有一张嵌木细工的旧牌桌，桌面上画着棋盘。牌桌后面的壁上挂一只椭圆形的晴雨表，黑框子四周有金漆的丝带形花边，苍蝇肆无忌惮地叮在上面张牙舞爪，恐怕不会有多少金漆留下的了。

壁炉架对面的壁上，挂两幅水粉画的肖像，据说一个是葛朗台太太的外公，特·拉·裴德里埃老人，穿着王家禁卫军连长的制服；一个是故香蒂埃太太，绾着一个古式的髻。窗帘用的是都尔红绸，两旁用系有大坠子的丝带吊起。这种奢华的装饰，跟葛朗台一家的习惯很不调和，原来是买进这所屋子的时候就有的，连镜框、座钟、花绸面的家具、红木酒橱等等都是。

靠门的窗洞下面，一张草坐垫的椅子放在一个木座上，使葛朗台太太坐了可以望见街上的行人。另外一张褪色樱桃木的女红台，把窗洞的空间填满了，近旁还有欧也妮的小靠椅。

十五年以来，从四月到十一月，母女俩就在这个位置上安安静静地消磨日子，手里永远拿着活计。十一月初一，她们可以搬到壁炉旁边过冬了。只有到那一天，葛朗台才答应在堂屋里生火，到三月三十一日就得熄掉，不管春寒不管早秋的凉意。四月和十月里最冷的日子，长脚拿侬想法从厨房里腾出些柴炭，安排一只脚炉，给太太和小姐挡挡早晚的寒气。

全家的内衣被服都归母女俩负责，她们专心一意，像女工一样整天劳作，甚至欧也妮想替母亲绣一方挑花领，也只能腾出睡眠的时间来做，还得想出借口来骗取父亲的蜡烛。多年来女儿与拿侬用的蜡烛，吝啬鬼总是亲自分发的，正如每天早上分发面包和食物一样。

也许只有长脚拿侬受得了她主人的那种专制。索漠城里都羡慕葛朗台夫妇有这样一个老妈子。大家叫她长脚拿侬，因为她身高五尺八寸。她在葛朗台家已经做了三十五年。虽然一年的工薪只有六十法郎，大家已经认为她是城里最有钱的女仆了。一年六十法郎，积了三十五年，最近居然有四千法郎存在公证人克罗旭那儿做终身年金。这笔长期不断的积蓄，似乎是一个了不得的数目。每个女佣看见这个上了六十岁的老妈子有了老年的口粮，都十分眼热，却没有想到这份口粮是辛辛苦苦做牛马换来的。

二十二岁的时候，这可怜的姑娘到处没有人要，她的脸丑得叫人害怕；其实这么说是过分的，把她的脸放在一个掷弹兵的脖子上，还可受到人家称赞哩；可是据说什么东西都要相称。她先是替农家放牛，农家遭了火灾，她就凭着天不怕地不怕的勇气，进城来找事。

那时葛朗台正想自立门户，预备娶亲。他瞥见了这到处碰壁的女孩子。以箍桶匠的眼光判断一个人的体力是准没有错：她体格像大力士，站在那儿仿佛一株六十年的橡树，根牢蒂固；粗大的腰围，四方的背脊，一双手像个赶车的；诚实不欺的德行，正如她的贞操一般纯洁无瑕。在这样一个女人身上可以榨取多少利益，他算得清清楚楚。雄赳赳的脸上生满了疣，紫膛膛的皮色，青筋隆起的胳膊，褴褛的衣衫，拿侬这些外表并没吓退箍桶匠，虽然他那时还在能够动心的年纪。他给这个可怜的姑娘衣着、鞋袜、膳宿，出了工钱雇用她，也不过分地虐待、糟蹋。

长脚拿侬受到这样的待遇暗中快活得哭了，就一片忠心地服侍箍桶匠。而箍桶匠当她家奴一般利用。拿侬包办一切：煮饭，蒸洗东西，拿衣服到洛阿河边去洗，担在肩上回来；天一亮就起身，深夜才睡觉；收成时节，所有短工的饭食都归她料理，还不让人家捡取掉在地下的葡萄；她像一条忠心的狗一样保护主人的财产。总之，她对他信服得五体投地，无论他什么想入非非的念头，她都不哼一声地服从。一八一一那有名的一年[3]收获季节特别辛苦，这时拿侬已经服务了二十年，葛朗台才发狠赏了她一只旧表，那是她到手的唯一礼物。固然他一向把穿旧的鞋子给她（她正好穿得上），但是每隔三个月得来的鞋子，已经那么破烂，不能叫作礼物了。可怜的姑娘因为一无所有，变得吝啬不堪，终于使葛朗台像喜欢一条狗一样地喜欢她，而拿侬也甘心情愿让人家把链条套上脖子，链条上的刺，她已经不觉得痛了。

要是葛朗台把面包割得过分小气了一点，她绝不抱怨；这份人家饮食严格，从来没有人闹病，拿侬也乐于接受这卫生的好处。而且她跟主人家已经打成一片：葛朗台笑，她也笑；葛朗台发愁、挨冷、取暖、工作，她也跟着发愁、挨冷、取暖、工作。这样不分彼此的平等，还不算甜蜜的安慰吗？她在树底下吃些杏子、桃子、枣子，主人从来不埋怨。

有些年份的果子把树枝都压弯了，佃户拿去喂猪，于是葛朗台对拿侬说：“吃呀，拿侬，尽吃。”

这个穷苦的乡下女人，从小只受到虐待，人家为了善心才把她收留下来；对于她，葛朗台老头那种叫人猜不透意思的笑，真像一道阳光似的。而且拿侬单纯的心、简单的头脑，只容得下一种感情、一个念头。三十五年如一日，她老是看到自己站在葛朗台先生的工场前面，赤着脚，穿着破烂衣衫，听见箍桶匠对她说：“你要什么呀，好孩子？”她心中的感激永远是那么新鲜。

有时候，葛朗台想到这个可怜虫从没听见一句奉承的话，完全不懂女人所能获得的那些温情；将来站在上帝前面受审，她比圣母玛利亚还要贞洁。葛朗台想到这些，不禁动了怜悯，望着她说：

“可怜的拿侬！”

老用人听了，总是用一道难以形容的目光瞧他一下。时常挂在嘴边的这句感叹，久已成为他们之间不断的友谊的链锁，而每说一遍，链锁总多加上一环。出于葛朗台的心坎，而使老姑娘感激的这种怜悯，不知怎样总有一点儿可怕的气息。这种吝啬鬼的残酷的怜悯，在老箍桶匠是因为想起在用人身上刮到了多少好处而得意，在拿侬却是全部的快乐。“可怜的拿侬！”这样的话谁不会说？但是说话的音调、语气之间莫测高深的惋惜，可以使上帝认出谁才是真正的慈悲。

索漠有许多家庭待用人好得多，用人却仍然对主人不满意。于是又有这样的话流传了：

“葛朗台他们对长脚拿侬怎么的，她会这样的忠心？简直肯替他们拼命！”

厨房临着院子，窗上装有铁栅，老是干净，整齐，冷冰冰的，真是守财奴的灶屋，没有一点儿糟蹋的东西。拿侬晚上洗过碗盏，收起剩菜，熄了灶火，便到跟厨房隔着一条过道的堂屋里绩麻，跟主人们在一块。这样，一个黄昏全家只消点一支蜡烛了。老妈子睡的是过道底上的一个小房间，只消有一个墙洞漏进一些日光；躺在这样一个窝里，她结实的身体居然毫无亏损。她可以听见日夜都静悄悄的屋子里的任何响动，像一条看家狗似的，她竖着耳朵睡觉，一边休息一边守夜。

屋子其余的部分，等故事发展下去的时候再来描写；但全家精华所在的堂屋的景象，已可令人想见楼上的寒碜了。

一八一九年，秋季的天气特别好；到十一月中旬某一天傍晚时分，长脚拿侬才第一次生火。那一天是克罗旭与台·格拉桑两家记得清清楚楚的节日。双方六位人马，预备全副武装，到堂屋里交一交手，比一比谁表示得更亲热。

早上，索漠的人看见葛朗台太太和葛朗台小姐，后边跟着拿侬，到教堂去望弥撒，于是大家记起了这一天是欧也妮小姐的生日。克罗旭公证人，克罗旭神父，克·特·篷风先生，算准了葛朗台家该吃完晚饭的时候，急急忙忙赶来，要抢在台·格拉桑一家之前，向葛朗台小姐拜寿。三个人都捧着从小花坛中摘来的大束的花。所长那束，花梗上很巧妙地裹着金色穗子的白缎带。

每逢欧也妮的生日和本名节日[4]，照例葛朗台清早就直闯到女儿床边，郑重其事地把他为父的礼物亲手交代，十三年来的老规矩，都是一枚稀罕的金洋。

葛朗台太太总给女儿一件衣衫，或是冬天穿的，或是夏天穿的，看什么节而定。这两件衣衫，加上父亲在新年跟他自己的节日所赏赐的金洋，她每年小小的收入大概有五六百法郎，葛朗台很高兴地看她慢慢地积起来。这不过是把自己的钱换一只口袋罢了，而且可以从小培养女儿的吝啬。他不时盘问一下她财产的数目——其中一部分是从葛朗台太太的外婆那里来的——盘问的时候总说：

“这是你陪嫁的压箱钱呀。”

所谓压箱钱是一种古老的风俗，法国中部有些地方至今还很郑重地保存在那里。裴里、安育那一带，一个姑娘出嫁的时候，不是娘家便是婆家，总得给她一笔金洋或银洋，或是十二枚，或是一百四十四枚，或是一千二百枚，看家境而定。最穷的牧羊女出嫁，压箱钱也非有不可，就是拿大铜钱充数也是好的。伊苏屯地方，至今还谈论曾经有一个有钱的独养女儿，压箱钱是一百四十四枚葡萄牙金洋。凯塞琳·特·美第奇嫁给亨利二世，她的叔叔教皇克雷门七世送给她一套古代的金勋章，价值连城。

吃晚饭的时候，父亲看见女儿穿了新衣衫格外漂亮，便喜欢得什么似的，嚷道：

“既然是欧也妮的生日，咱们生起火来，取个吉利吧！”

长脚拿侬撤下饭桌上吃剩的鹅，箍桶匠家里的珍品，一边说：

“小姐今年一定要大喜了。”

“索漠城里没有合适的人家啊。”葛朗台太太接口道，她一眼望着丈夫的那种胆怯的神气，以她的年龄而论，活现出可怜的女人是一向对丈夫服从惯的。

葛朗台端详着女儿，快活地叫道：

“今天她刚好二十三了，这孩子。是咱们操心的时候了。”

欧也妮和她的母亲心照不宣地彼此瞧了一眼。

葛朗台太太是一个干枯的瘦女人，皮色黄黄的像木瓜，举动迟缓，笨拙，就像那些生来受磨折的女人。大骨骼，大鼻子，大额角，大眼睛，一眼望去，好像既无味道又无汁水的干瘪果子。黝黑的牙齿已经不多几颗，嘴巴全是皱裥，长长的下巴颏儿往上钩起，像只木底靴。可是她为人极好，真有裴德里埃家风。克罗旭神父常常有心借机会告诉她，她当初并不怎样难看，她居然会相信。性情柔和得像天使，忍耐功夫不下于给孩子们捉弄的虫蚁，少有的虔诚，平静的心境绝对不会骚乱，一片好心，每个人可怜她，敬重她。

丈夫给她的零用，每次从不超过六法郎。虽然相貌奇丑，她的陪嫁与承继的遗产，给葛朗台先生带来三十多万法郎。然而她始终诚惶诚恐，仿佛寄人篱下似的；天性的柔和，使她摆脱不了这种奴性，她既没要求过一个钱，也没对克罗旭公证人叫她签字的文件表示过异议。支配这个女人的，只有闷在肚里的那股愚不可及的傲气，以及葛朗台非但不了解还要加以伤害的慷慨的心胸。

葛朗台太太永远穿一件淡绿绸衫，照例得穿上一年；戴一条棉料的白围巾，头上一顶草帽，差不多永远系一条黑纱围身。难得出门，鞋子很省。总之，她自己从来不想要一点儿什么。

有时，葛朗台想起自从上次给了她六法郎以后已经有好久，觉得过意不去，便在出售当年收成的契约上添注一笔，要买主掏出些中佣金给他太太。向葛朗台买酒的荷兰商人或比国商人，总得破费上百法郎，这就是葛朗台太太一年之中最可观的进款。

可是，她一朝拿到了上百法郎，丈夫往往对她说（仿佛他们用的钱一向是公账似的）：“借几个子儿给我，好不好？”可怜的女人，老是听到忏悔师说男人是她的夫君，是她的主人，所以觉得能够帮他忙是最快活不过的，一个冬天也就还了他好些佣金。

葛朗台掏出了做零用、买针线、付女儿衣着的六法郎月费，把钱袋扣上之后，总不忘了向他女人问一声：

“喂，妈妈，你想要一点儿什么吗？”

“哦，那个，慢慢再说吧。”葛朗台太太回答，她觉得做母亲的应该保持她的尊严。

这种伟大真是白费！葛朗台自以为对太太慷慨得很呢。像拿侬、葛朗台太太、欧也妮小姐这等人物，倘使给哲学家碰到了，不是很有理由觉得上帝的本性是喜欢跟人开玩笑吗？

在初次提到欧也妮婚事的那餐晚饭之后，拿侬到楼上葛朗台先生房里拿一瓶果子酒，下来的时候几乎摔了一跤。

“蠢东西，”葛朗台先生叫道，“你也会栽斤斗吗，你？”

“哎哟，先生，那是你的楼梯不行呀。”

“不错，”葛朗台太太接口，“你早该修理了，昨天晚上，欧也妮也险些儿扭坏了脚。”葛朗台看见拿侬脸色发白，便说：

“好，既然是欧也妮的生日，你又几乎摔跤，就请你喝一杯果子酒压压惊吧。”

“真是，这杯酒是我把命拼来的。换了别人，瓶子早已摔掉了；我哪怕碰断肘子，也要把酒瓶擎得老高，不让它砸破呢。”

“可怜的拿侬！”葛朗台一边说一边替她斟酒。

“跌痛没有？”欧也妮很关切地望着她问。

“没有，我挺一挺腰就站住了。”

“得啦，既然是欧也妮的生日，”葛朗台说，“我就去替你们修理踏级吧。你们这般人，就不会拣结实的地方落脚。”

葛朗台拿了烛台，走到烤面包的房里去拿木板、钉子和工具，让太太、女儿、用人坐在暗里，除了壁炉的活泼的火焰之外，没有一点儿光亮。拿侬听见他在楼梯上敲击的声音，便问：

“要不要帮忙？”

“不用，不用！我会对付。”老箍桶匠回答。

葛朗台一边修理虫蛀的楼梯，一边想起少年时代的事情，直着喉咙打呼哨。这时候，三位克罗旭来敲门了。

“是你吗，克罗旭先生？”拿侬凑在铁栅上张了一张。

“是的。”所长回答。

拿侬打开大门，壁炉的火光照在环洞里，三位克罗旭才看清了堂屋的门口。拿侬闻到花香，便说：

“啊！你们是来拜寿的。”

“对不起，诸位，”葛朗台听出了客人的声音，嚷道，“我马上就来！不瞒你们说，楼梯的踏级坏了，我自己在修呢。”

“不招呼，不招呼！葛朗台先生。区区煤炭匠，在家也好当市长。”所长引经据典地说完，独自笑开了，却没有人懂得他把成语改头换面，影射葛朗台当过区长。

葛朗台母女俩站了起来。所长趁堂屋里没有灯光，便对欧也妮说道：

“小姐，今天是你的生日，我祝贺你年年快乐，岁岁康强！”

说着他献上一大束索漠城里少有的鲜花；然后抓着独养女儿的肘子，把她脖子两边各亲了一下，那副得意的神气把欧也妮羞得什么似的。所长像一颗生锈的大铁钉，自以为这样就是追求女人。

“所长先生，不用拘束啊，”葛朗台走进来说，“过节的日子，照例得痛快一下。”

克罗旭神父也捧着他的一束花，接口说：

“跟令爱在一块儿，舍侄觉得天天都是过节呢。”

说完话，神父吻了吻欧也妮的手。公证人克罗旭却老实不客气亲了她的腮帮，说：

“哎，哎，岁月催人，又是一年了。”

葛朗台有了一句笑话，轻易不肯放弃，只要自己觉得好玩，会三番四次地说个不休；他把烛台往座钟前面一放，说道：

“既然是欧也妮的生日，咱们就大放光明吧！”

他很小心地摘下灯台上的管子，每根按上了灯芯盘，从拿侬手里接过一根纸卷的新蜡烛，放入洞眼，插妥了，点上了，然后走去坐在太太旁边，把客人、女儿和两支蜡烛，轮流打量过来。克罗旭神父矮小肥胖，浑身是肉，茶红的假头发，像是压扁了的，脸孔像个爱开玩笑的老太婆，套一双银搭扣的结实的鞋子。他把脚一伸，问道：

“台·格拉桑他们没有来吗？”

“还没有。”葛朗台回答。

“他们会来吗？”老公证人扭动着那张脚炉盖似的脸问。

“我想会来的。”葛朗台太太回答。

“府上的葡萄收割完了吗？”特·篷风所长问葛朗台。

“统统完了！”葛朗台老头说着，站起身来在堂屋里踱步，他把胸脯一挺的那股劲儿，跟“统统完了”四个字一样骄傲。

长脚拿侬不敢闯入过节的场面，便在厨房内点起蜡烛，坐在灶旁预备绩麻。葛朗台从过道的门里瞥见了，踱过去嚷道：

“拿侬，你能不能灭了灶火，熄了蜡烛，上我们这儿来？嘿！这里地方大得很，怕挤不下吗？”

“可是先生，你们那里有贵客哪。”

“怕什么？他们不跟你一样是上帝造的吗？”

葛朗台说完又走过来问所长：“府上的收成脱手没有？”

“没有。老实说，我不想卖。现在的酒固然好，过两年更好。你知道，地主都发誓要坚持公议的价格。那些比国人这次休想占便宜了。他们这回不买，下回还是要来的。”

“不错，可是咱们要齐心啊。”葛朗台的语调，叫所长打了一个寒噤。

“他会不会跟他们暗中谈判呢？”克罗旭心里想。

这时大门上锤子响了一下，报告台·格拉桑一家来了。葛朗台太太和克罗旭神父才开始的话题，只得搁过一边。

台·格拉桑太太是那种矮小活泼的女人，身材肥胖，皮肤白里泛红，过着修道院式的内地生活，律身谨严，所以在四十岁上还显得年轻。这等女子仿佛过时的最后几朵蔷薇，叫人看了舒服，但它们的花瓣有种说不出的冰冷的感觉，香气也淡薄得很了。她穿着相当讲究，行头都从巴黎带来，索漠的时装就把她做标准，而且家里经常举行晚会。

她的丈夫在拿破仑的禁卫军中当过连长，在奥斯丹列兹一役受了重伤，退伍了，对葛朗台虽然尊敬，但是爽直非凡，不失军人本色。

“你好，葛朗台。”他说着向葡萄园主伸出手来，一副俨然的气派是他一向用来压倒克罗旭的。向葛朗台太太行过礼，他又对欧也妮说：“小姐，你老是这样美，这样贤惠，简直想不出祝贺你的话。”

然后他从跟班手里接过一口匣子递过去，里面装着一株好望角的铁树，这种花还是最近带到欧洲而极少见的。

台·格拉桑太太非常亲热地拥抱了欧也妮，握着她的手说：

“我的一点儿小意思，叫阿道夫代献吧。”

一个头发金黄、个子高大的青年，苍白，娇弱，举动相当文雅，外表很羞怯，可是最近到巴黎念法律，膳宿之外，居然花掉上万法郎。这时他走到欧也妮前面，亲了亲她的腮帮，献上一个针线匣子，所有的零件都是镀金的；匣面上哥特式的花体字，把欧也妮姓名的缩写刻得不坏，好似做工很精巧，其实全部是骗人的起码货。

欧也妮揭开匣子，感到一种出乎意外的快乐，那是使所有的少女脸红、寒战、高兴得发抖的快乐。她望着父亲，似乎问他可不可以接受。葛朗台说一声：“收下吧，孩子！”那强劲有力的音调竟可以使一个角儿成名呢。

这样贵重的礼物，独养女儿还是第一遭看见，她的快活与兴奋的目光，使劲盯住了阿道夫·台·格拉桑，把三位克罗旭看呆了。台·格拉桑先生掏出鼻烟壶，让了一下主人，自己闻了一下，把蓝外套纽孔上“荣誉团”丝带上的烟末抖干净了，转过头去望着几位克罗旭，神气之间仿佛说：“嘿，瞧我这一手！”

台·格拉桑太太就像一个喜欢讥笑人家的女子，装作特意寻找克罗旭他们的礼物，把蓝瓶里的鲜花瞅了一眼。在这番微妙的比赛中，大家围坐在壁炉前面；克罗旭神父却丢下众人，径自和葛朗台踱到堂屋那一头，离台·格拉桑最远的窗洞旁边，咬着守财奴的耳朵说：

“这些人简直把钱往窗外扔。”

“没有关系，反正是扔在我的地窖里。”葛朗台回答。

“你给女儿打把金剪刀也打得起呢。”神父又道。

“金剪刀有什么稀罕，我给她的东西名贵得多哩。”

克罗旭所长那猪肝色的脸本来就不体面，加上乱蓬蓬的头发，愈显得难看了。神父望着他，心里想：

“这位老侄真是一个傻瓜，一点儿讨人喜欢的小玩意儿都想不出来！”

这时台·格拉桑太太嚷道：

“咱们陪你玩一会儿牌吧，葛朗台太太。”

“这么多人，好来两局呢……”

“既然是欧也妮的生日，你们不妨来个摸彩的玩意儿，让两个孩子也参加。”老箍桶匠一边说一边指着欧也妮和阿道夫，他自己是对什么游戏都从不参加的。

“来，拿侬，摆桌子。”

“我们来帮忙，拿侬。”台·格拉桑太太很高兴地说，她因为得了欧也妮的欢心，快活得不得了。那位独养女儿对她说：

“我一辈子都没有这么快乐过，我从没见过这样漂亮的东西。”

台·格拉桑太太便咬着她的耳朵：

“那是阿道夫从巴黎捎来的，他亲自挑的呢。”

“好，好，你去灌迷汤吧，刁钻促狭的鬼女人！”所长心里想，“一朝你家有什么官司落在我手中，不管是你的还是你丈夫的，哼，看你有好结果吧。”

公证人坐在一旁，神色泰然地望着神父，想道：

“台·格拉桑他们是白费心的。我的家私，我兄弟的，侄子的，合在一起有一百一十万。台·格拉桑最多也不过抵得一半，何况他们还有一个女儿要嫁！好吧，他们爱送礼就送吧！终有一天，独养女儿跟他们的礼物，会一股脑儿落在咱们手里的。”

八点半，两张牌桌端整好了。俊俏的台·格拉桑太太居然能够把儿子安排在欧也妮旁边。各人拿着一块有数目字与格子的纸板，抓着蓝玻璃的码子，开始玩了。这聚精会神的一幕，虽然表面上平淡无奇，所有的角儿装作听着老公证人的笑话——他摸一颗码子，念一个数目，总要开一次玩笑——其实都念念不忘地想着葛朗台的几百万家私。

老箍桶匠踌躇满志地把台·格拉桑太太时髦的打扮、粉红的帽饰，银行家威武的脸相，还有阿道夫、所长、神父、公证人的脑袋，一个个地打量过来，暗自想道：

“他们都看中我的钱，为了我女儿到这儿来受罪。哼！我的女儿，休想；我就利用这般人替我钓鱼！”

灰色的老客厅里，黑魆魆地只点两支蜡烛，居然也有家庭的欢乐；拿侬的纺车声，替众人的笑声当着伴奏，可是只有欧也妮和她母亲的笑才是真心的；小人的心胸都在关切重大的利益；这位姑娘受到奉承、包围，以为他们的友谊都是真情实意，仿佛一只小鸟全不知道给人家标着高价作为赌注。这种种使那天晚上的情景显得又可笑又可叹。这原是古往今来到处在搬演的活剧，这儿不过表现得最简单罢了。利用两家的假殷勤而占足便宜的葛朗台，是这一幕的主角，有了他，这一幕才有意义。单凭这个人的脸，不是就象征了法力无边的财神，现代人的上帝吗？

人生的温情在此只居于次要地位；它只能激动拿侬、欧也妮和她母亲三颗纯洁的心。而且她们能有这么一点儿天真，还是因为她们蒙在鼓里，一无所知！葛朗台的财富，母女俩全不知道；她们对人生的看法，只凭一些渺茫的观念，对金钱既不看重也不看轻，她们一向就用不到它。她们的情感虽然无形中受了伤害，依旧很强烈，而且是她们生命的真谛，使她们在这一群唯利是图的人中间别具一格。人类的处境就是这一点可怕！没有一宗幸福不是靠糊涂得来的。

葛朗台太太中了十六个铜子的彩，在这儿是破天荒第一遭的大彩；长脚拿侬看见太太有这许多钱落袋，快活地笑了。正在这时候，大门上“砰”的一声，锤子敲得那么响，把太太们吓得从椅子里直跳起来。

“这种敲门的气派绝不是本地人。”公证人说。

“哪有这样敲法的！”拿侬说，“难道想砸破大门吗？”

“哪个混账东西！”葛朗台咕噜着。

拿侬在两支蜡烛中拿了一支去开门，葛朗台跟着她。

“葛朗台！葛朗台！”他太太莫名其妙地害怕起来，往堂屋门口追上去叫。

牌桌上的人都面面相觑。

“咱们一块儿去怎么样？”台·格拉桑说，“这种敲门有点儿来意不善。”

台·格拉桑才看见一个青年人的模样，后面跟着驿站上的脚夫，扛了两口大箱子，拖了几个铺盖卷，葛朗台便突然转过身来对太太说：

“玩你们的，太太，让我来招呼客人。”

说着他把客厅的门使劲一拉。那些骚动的客人都归了原位，却并没玩下去。台·格拉桑太太问她的丈夫：

“是不是索漠城里的人？”

“不，外地来的。”

“一定是巴黎来的了。”

公证人掏出一只两指厚的老表，形式像荷兰战舰，瞧了瞧说：“不错，整九点。该死，驿车倒从来不脱班。”

“客人还年轻吗？”克罗旭神父问。

“年轻，”台·格拉桑答道，“带来的行李至少有三百斤。”

“拿侬还不进来？”欧也妮说。

“大概是府上的亲戚吧。”所长插了句嘴。

“咱们下注吧，”葛朗台太太轻声轻气地叫道，“听葛朗台的声音，他很不高兴；也许他不愿意我们谈论他的事。”

“小姐，”阿道夫对坐在隔壁的欧也妮说，“一定是你的堂兄弟葛朗台，一个挺漂亮的青年，我在纽沁根先生家的跳舞会上见过的。”

阿道夫停住不说了，他给母亲踩了一脚；她高声叫他拿出两个铜子来押，又咬着他的耳朵：

“别多嘴，你这个傻瓜！”

这时大家听见拿侬和脚夫走上楼梯的声音；葛朗台带着客人进了堂屋。几分钟以来，个个人都给不速之客提足了精神，好奇得不得了，所以他的到场，他的出现，在这些人中间，犹如蜂房里掉进了一只蜗牛，或是乡下黝黑的鸡场里闯进了一只孔雀。

“到壁炉这边来坐吧。”葛朗台招呼他。

年轻的陌生人就座之前，对众人客客气气鞠了一躬。男客都起身还礼，太太们都深深地福了一福。

“你冷了吧，先生？”葛朗台太太说，“你大概从……”

葛朗台捧着一封信在念，马上停下来截住了太太的话：

“嘿！娘儿腔！不用烦，让他歇歇再说。”

“可是父亲，也许客人需要什么呢。”欧也妮说。

“他会开口的。”老头厉声回答。

这种情形只有那位生客觉得奇怪。其余的人都看惯了这个家伙的霸道。客人听了这两句问答，不禁站起身子，背对着壁炉，提起一双脚烘烤靴底，一面对欧也妮说：

“大姊，谢谢你，我在都尔吃过晚饭了。”他又望着葛朗台说，“什么都不用费心，我也一点儿不觉得累。”

“先生是从京里来的吧？”台·格拉桑太太问。

查理（这是巴黎葛朗台的儿子的名字）听见有人插嘴，便拈起用金链挂在项下的小小的手眼镜，凑在右眼上瞧了瞧桌上的东西和周围的人物，非常放肆地把眼镜向台·格拉桑太太一照，他把一切都看清楚了，才回答说：

“是的，太太。”他又回头对葛朗台太太说，“哦，你们在摸彩，伯母。请呀，请呀，玩下去吧，多有趣的玩意儿，怎么好歇手呢！……”

“我早知道他就是那个堂兄弟。”台·格拉桑太太对他做着媚眼，心里想。

“四十七，”老神父嚷道，“哎，台·格拉桑太太，放呀，这不是你的号数吗？”

台·格拉桑先生抓起一个码子替太太放上了纸板。她却觉得预兆不好，一忽儿望望巴黎来的堂兄弟，一忽儿望望欧也妮，想不起摸彩的事了。年轻的独养女儿不时对堂兄弟瞟上几眼，银行家太太不难看出她越来越惊讶、越来越好奇的情绪。

巴黎的堂兄弟


查理·葛朗台，二十二岁的俊俏后生，跟那些老实的内地人正好成为古怪的对照；人家看了他贵族式的举动态度已经心中有气，而且还在加以研究，以便大大地讪笑他一番。这缘故需要说明一下。

在二十二岁上，青年人还很接近童年，免不了孩子气。一百个中间，说不定九十九个都会像查理·葛朗台一样的行事。那天晚上的前几日，父亲吩咐他到索漠的伯父那里住几个月。也许巴黎的葛朗台念头转到欧也妮。初次跑到内地的查理，便想拿出一个时髦青年的摽劲，在州县里摆阔，在地方上开风气，带一些巴黎社会的新玩意儿来。总之，一句话说尽，他要在索漠比在巴黎花更多的时间刷指甲，对衣着特别出神入化，下一番苦功，岂不比有些时候一个风流年少的人倒故意地不修边幅，要显得潇洒。

因此，查理带了巴黎最漂亮的猎装，最漂亮的猎枪，最漂亮的刀子，最漂亮的刀鞘。他也带了全套最新奇的背心：灰的，白的，黑的，金壳虫色的，闪金光的，嵌水钻的，五色条纹的，双叠襟的，高领口的，直领口的，翻领的，纽扣一直扣到脖子的，金纽扣的。还有当时风行的各式硬领与领带，名裁缝蒲伊松做的两套服装，最讲究的内衣。母亲给的一套华丽的纯金梳妆用具也随身带了。凡是花花公子的玩意儿，都已带全；一只玲珑可爱的小文具盒也没有忘记。这是一个最可爱的——至少在他心目中———他叫作阿纳德的阔太太送的礼物。她此刻正在苏格兰陪着丈夫游历，烦闷不堪，可是为了某些谣言不得不暂时牺牲一下幸福。他也带了非常华丽的信笺，预备每半个月和她通一次信。巴黎浮华生活的行头，简直应有尽有，从决斗开场时用的马鞭起，直到决斗结束时用的镂工细巧的手枪为止，一个游手好闲的青年出门打天下的随身家伙，都包括尽了。父亲吩咐他一个人上路，切勿浪费，所以他包了驿车的前厢，很高兴那辆特地定造、预备六月里坐到巴登温泉与贵族太太阿纳德相会的轻巧可爱的轿车，不致在这次旅行中糟蹋。

查理预备在伯父家里碰到上百客人，一心想到他森林中去围猎，过一下城堡生活。他想不到伯父就在索漠；车子到的时候，他打听去法劳丰的路；等到知道伯父在城里，便以为他住的必是高堂大厦。索漠也罢，法劳丰也罢，初次在伯父家露面非体体面面不行，所以他的旅行装束是最漂亮的，最大方的，用当时形容一个人、一件东西美到极点的口语说，是最可爱的。利用在都尔打尖的时间，他叫了一个理发匠把美丽的栗色头发重新烫过；衬衫也换过一件，戴一条黑缎子领带，配上圆领，把那张满面春风的小白脸愈加显得可爱了；一袭小腰身的旅行外套，纽扣只扣了一半，露出一件高领羊毛背心，里面还有第二件白背心；他的表随便纳在一只口袋里，短短的金链系在纽孔上；灰色裤子，纽扣都在两旁，加上黑丝线绣成的图案，式样更美观了；他极有风趣地挥动手杖，雕刻精工的黄金柄，并没夺去灰色手套的光泽。最后，他的便帽也是很大方的。

只有巴黎人，一个第一流的巴黎人，才能这样打扮而不至于俗气，才有本领使那些无聊的装饰显得调和；给这些行头做支援的，还有一股摽劲，表示他有的是漂亮的手枪，百发百中的功夫，还有那位贵族太太阿纳德。

因此，要了解索漠人与年轻的巴黎人彼此的惊讶，要在堂屋与构成这幅家庭小景的灰暗的阴影中，把来客风流典雅的光彩看个真切的话，就得把几位克罗旭的模样悬想一番。三个人都吸鼻烟，既淌鼻水，又把黄里带红、衣领打皱、褶裥发黄的衬衫胸饰沾满了小黑点：他们久已不在乎这些。软绵绵的领带，一扣上去就缩成一根绳子。衬衫内衣之多，一年只要洗两次，在衣柜底上成年累月地放旧了，颜色也灰了。邋遢与衰老在他们身上合而为一。跟破烂衣服一样衰败，跟裤子一样打皱，他们的面貌显得憔悴、硬化，嘴脸都扭作一团。

其余的人也是衣冠不整，七零八落，没有一点儿新鲜气象，跟克罗旭他们的落拓半斤八两。内地的装束大概都是如此，大家不知不觉地只关心一副手套的价钱，而不想打扮给人家看了。只有讨厌时装这一点，台·格拉桑与克罗旭两派的意见是一致的。巴黎客人一拿起手眼镜，打量堂屋里古怪的陈设，楼板的梁木，护壁板的色调，护壁板上数量多得可以标点《日用百科全书》与《政府公报》的苍蝇屎的时候，那些玩摸彩戏的人便立刻扬起鼻子打量他，好奇的神情似乎在看一头长颈鹿。台·格拉桑父子虽然见识过时髦人物，也跟在座的人一样的惊讶，或许是众人的情绪有股说不出的力量把他们感染了，或许他们表示赞成，所以含讥带讽地对大家挤眉弄眼，仿佛说：“你们瞧，巴黎人就是这副腔派。”

并且他们尽可从从容容地端详查理，不用怕得罪主人。葛朗台全副精神在对付手里的一封长信，为了看信，他把牌桌上唯一的蜡烛拿开了，既不顾到客人，也不顾到他们的兴致。欧也妮从来没见过这样美满的装束与人品，以为堂兄弟是什么天上掉下来的妙人儿。光亮而拳曲有致的头发散出一阵阵的香气，她尽量地闻着，嗅着，觉得飘飘然。漂亮精美的手套，她恨不得去摸一下那光滑的皮。她羡慕查理的小手，皮色、面貌的娇嫩与清秀。这可以说是把风流公子给她的印象做了一个概括的叙述。可是一个没有见过世面的姑娘，只知道缝袜子，替父亲补衣裳，在满壁油腻的屋子里讨生活的——冷静的街上一小时难得看到一个行人——这样一个女子一见这位堂兄弟，自然要神魂颠倒，好像一个青年在英国圣诞画册上看到了那些奇妙的女人，镂刻的精巧，大有吹一口气就会把天仙似的美女从纸上吹走了似的。

查理掏出一条手帕，是在苏格兰游历的阔太太绣的，美丽的绣作正是热恋中怀着满腔爱情做成的；欧也妮望着堂兄弟，看他是否当真拿来用。查理的举动，态度，拿手眼镜的姿势，故意的放肆，还有对富家闺女刚才多么喜欢的那个针线匣，他认为毫无价值或俗不可耐而一脸瞧不起的神气，总之，查理的一切，凡是克罗旭与台·格拉桑他们看了刺眼的，欧也妮都觉得赏心悦目，使她当晚在床上老想着那个了不起的堂兄弟，睡不着觉。

摸彩摸得很慢，不久也就歇了。因为长脚拿侬进来高声地说：

“太太，得找被单替客人铺床啦。”

葛朗台太太跟着拿侬走了。台·格拉桑太太便轻轻地说：

“我们把钱收起来，歇了吧。”

各人从缺角的旧碟子内把两个铜子的赌注收起，一齐走到壁炉前面，谈一会儿天。

“你们完了吗？”葛朗台说着，照样念他的信。

“完了，完了。”台·格拉桑太太答着话，挨着查理坐下。欧也妮，像一般初次动心的少女一样，忽然想起了一个念头，离开堂屋，给母亲和拿侬帮忙去了。要是一个手腕高明的忏悔师盘问她，她一定会承认那时既没想到母亲，也没想到拿侬，而是非常急切地要看看堂兄弟的卧房，替他张罗一下，放点儿东西进去，唯恐家人有什么遗漏，样样要想个周到，使他的卧房尽可能显得漂亮干净。欧也妮已经认为只有她才懂得堂兄弟的口味与心思。

母亲与拿侬以为一切安排定当，预备下楼了，她却正好赶上，指点给她们看，什么都不行。她提醒拿侬捡一些炭火，弄个脚炉烘被单；她亲手把旧桌子铺上一方小台布，吩咐拿侬这块台布每天早上都得更换。她说服母亲，壁炉内非好好地生一个火不可，又逼着拿侬瞒了父亲搬一大堆木柴放在走廊里。特·拉·裴德里埃老先生的遗产里面，有一个古漆盘子放在堂屋的三角橱上，还有一只六角水晶杯，一只镀金褪尽的小羹匙，一个刻着爱神的古瓶：欧也妮一齐搬了来，得意扬扬地摆在壁炉架上。她这一忽儿的念头，比她出世以来所有的念头还要多。

“妈妈，”她说，“蜡油的气味，弟弟一定受不了。去买一支白烛怎么样？……”说着她像小鸟一般轻盈地跑去，从钱袋里掏出她的月费，一块五法郎的银币，说：

“喂，拿侬，快点儿去。”

她又拿了一个糖壶，赛佛窖烧的旧瓷器，是葛朗台从法劳丰别庄拿来的。葛朗台太太一看到就严重地警告说：

“哎，父亲看了还了得！……再说哪儿来的糖呢？你疯了吗？”

“妈妈，跟白烛一样好叫拿侬去买啊。”

“可是你父亲要怎么说呢？”

“他的侄儿连一杯糖水都没有喝，成什么话？而且他不会留意的。”

“嘿，什么都逃不过他的眼睛。”葛朗台太太侧了侧脑袋。

拿侬犹疑不决，她知道主人的脾气。

“去呀，拿侬，既然今天是我的生日！”

拿侬听见小主人第一次说笑话，不禁哈哈大笑，照她的吩咐去办了。

正当欧也妮跟母亲想法把葛朗台派给侄儿住的卧房装得漂亮一些的时候，查理却成为台·格拉桑太太大献殷勤、百般挑引的目标。

“你真有勇气呀，先生，”她对他说，“居然肯丢下巴黎冬天的娱乐，住到索漠来。不过，要是你不觉得我们太可怕的话，你慢慢会看到，这里一样可以玩儿的。”

接着她做了一个十足内地式的媚眼。内地女子的眼风，因为平常矜持到极点，谨慎到极点，反而有一种馋涎欲滴的神气，那是把一切欢娱当作窃盗或罪过的教士特有的眼风。

查理在堂屋里迷惘万分，意想之中伯父的别庄与豪华的生活，跟眼前种种差得太远了，所以他把台·格拉桑太太仔细瞧过之后，觉得她淡淡的还有一点儿巴黎妇女的影子。她上面那段话，对他好似一种邀请，他便客客气气地接受了，很自然地和她攀谈起来。台·格拉桑太太把嗓子逐渐放低，跟她说的体己话的内容配合。她和查理都觉得需要密谈一下。所以时而调情说笑，时而一本正经地闲扯了一会儿之后，那位手段巧妙的内地女子，趁其余的人谈论当时全索漠最关心的酒市行情而不注意她的时候，说道：

“先生，要是你肯赏光到舍间来，外子一定跟我一样的高兴。索漠城中，只有在舍间才能同时碰到商界巨头跟阀阅世家。在这两个社会里，我们都有份；他们也只愿意在我们家里见面，因为玩得痛快。我敢骄傲地说一句，旧家跟商界都很敬重我的丈夫。我们一定得给你解解闷。要是你老待在葛朗台先生家里，哎，天哪！不知你要烦成什么样呢！你的老伯是一个守财奴，一心只想他的葡萄秧；你的伯母是一个理路不清的老虔婆；你的堂姊，不痴不癫，没有教育，没有陪嫁，俗不可耐，整天只晓得缝抹布。”

“她很不错呢，这位太太。”查理这样想着，就跟台·格拉桑太太的装腔作势呼应起来。

“我看，太太，你大有把这位先生包办的意思。”又胖又高的银行家笑着插嘴。

听到这一句，公证人与所长都说了些俏皮话；可是神父很狡猾地望着他们，吸了一撮鼻烟，拿烟壶向大家让了一阵，把众人的思想归纳起来说：

“除了太太，还有谁能给这位先生在索漠当向导呢？”

“啊，啊！神父，你这句话是什么意思？”台·格拉桑先生问。

“我这句话，先生，对你，对尊夫人，对索漠城，对这位贵客，都表示最大的好意。”奸猾的老头儿说到末了，转身望着查理。

克罗旭神父装作全没注意查理和台·格拉桑太太的谈话，其实早已猜透了。

“先生，”阿道夫终于装作随便的样子，对查理说，“不知道你还记得我吗，在纽沁根男爵府上，跳四组舞的时候我曾经跟你照过一面[1]，并且……”

“啊，不错，先生，不错。”查理回答，他很诧异地发觉个个人都在巴结他。

“这一位是你的世兄吗？”他问台·格拉桑太太。神父狡猾地瞅了她一眼。

“是的，先生。”她说。

“那么你很年轻就上巴黎去了？”查理又转身问阿道夫。

“当然喽，先生，”神父插嘴道，“他们断了奶，咱们就打发他们进京看花花世界了。”

台·格拉桑太太极有深意地把神父瞪了一眼，表示质问。他却紧跟着说：

“只有在内地，才能看到像太太这样三十多岁的女子，儿子都快要法科毕业了，还是这么娇嫩。”他又转身对着台·格拉桑太太，“当年跳舞会里，男男女女站在椅子上争着看你跳舞的光景，还清清楚楚在我眼前呢。你红极一时的盛况仿佛是昨天的事。”

“噢！这个老浑蛋！”台·格拉桑太太心里想，“难道他猜到了我的心事吗？”

“看来我在索漠可以大大地走红呢。”查理一边想一边解开上衣的纽扣，把一双手按在背心上，眼睛望着空中，模仿英国雕刻家凯脱莱塑的拜伦的姿势。

葛朗台老头的不理会众人，或者不如说他聚精会神看信的神气，逃不过公证人和所长的眼睛。葛朗台的脸这时给烛光照得格外分明，他们想从他微妙的表情中间揣摩书信的内容。老头儿的神色，很不容易保持平日的镇静。并且像下面这样一封悲惨的信，他念的时候会装作怎样的表情，谁都可以想象得到：

大哥，我们分别快二十三年了。最后一次会面是我结婚的时候，那次我们是高高兴兴分手的。当然，我想不到有这么一天，要你独力支撑家庭。你当时为了家业兴隆多么快活。可是这封信到你手里的时候，我已经不在世界上了。以我的地位，我不愿在破产的羞辱之后还同意颜偷生。我在深渊边上挣扎到最后一刻，希望能突破难关。可是非倒不可。我的经纪人以及公证人洛庚，他们的破产，把我最后一些资本也弄光了。我欠了近四百万的债，资产只有一百万。囤积的酒，此刻正碰到市价惨跌，因为你们今年丰收，酒质又好。三天之后，全巴黎的人都要说：“葛朗台原来是个骗子！”我一生清白，想不到死后要受人唾骂。我既玷污了儿子的姓氏，又侵占了他母亲的一份财产。他还一点儿没有知道呢，我疼爱的这个可怜的孩子！我和他分手的时候，彼此依依不舍。幸而他不知道这次的诀别是我最后一次的发泄热情。将来他会不会咒我呢？大哥，大哥，儿女的诅咒是最可怕的！儿女得罪了我们，可以求告，讨饶；我们得罪了儿女，却永远挽回不了。葛朗台，你是我的兄长，应当保护我：不要让查理在我的坟墓上说一句狠毒的话！大哥，即使我用血泪写这封信，也不至于这样痛苦；因为我可以痛哭，可以流血，可以死，可以没有知觉；但我现在只觉得痛苦，而且眼看着死，一滴眼泪都没有。你如今是查理的父亲了，他没有外婆家的亲戚，你知道为什么。唉，为什么我当时不听从社会的成见呢？为什么我向爱情低头呢？为什么我娶了一个贵人的私生女儿？查理无家可归了。可怜的孩子！孩子！你得知道，葛朗台，我并不为了自己求你；并且你的家产也许还押不到三百万；我求你是为我的儿子呀！告诉你，大哥，我想到你的时候是合着双手哀求的。葛朗台，我临死之前把查理托付给你了。现在我望着手枪不觉得痛苦了，因为想到有你担起为父的责任。查理对我很孝顺，我对他那么慈爱，从来不违拗他，他不会恨我的。并且你慢慢可以看到：他性情和顺像他母亲，绝不会有什么事叫你难堪。可怜的孩子！他是享福惯的。你我小时候吃穿不全的苦处，他完全不知道……而他现在倾家荡产，只有一个人了！一定的，所有的朋友都要回避他，而他的羞辱是我造成的。啊！我恨不得把他一手带上天国，放在他母亲身边，唉，我简直疯了！我还得讲我的苦难，查理的苦难。我打发他到你那儿，让你把我的死讯和他将来的命运婉转地告诉他。希望你做他的父亲，慈爱的父亲。切勿一下子逼他戒绝悠闲的生活，那他会送命的。我愿意跪下来，求他抛弃母亲的遗产，而不要站在我的债权人的地位。可是不必，他有傲气，一定知道他不该和我的债主站在一起。你得教他趁早抛弃我的遗产[2]。我替他造成的艰苦的处境，你得仔细解释给他听；如果他对我的孝心不变，那么替我告诉他，前途并不绝望。咱俩当初都是靠工作翻身的，将来他也可以靠着工作把我败掉的家业挣回来。如果他肯听我这个父亲的话——为了他，我简直想从坟墓里爬起来——他应该出国，到印度去[3]！大哥，查理是一个勇敢正直的青年，你给他一批出口货让他经营，他死也不会赖掉你给他的第一笔资本的；你一定得供给他，葛朗台！否则你将来要受良心责备的。啊！要是你对我的孩子不肯帮忙，不加怜爱，我要永久求上帝惩罚你的无情无义。我很想能抢救出一部分财产，因为我有权在他母亲的财产里面留一笔给他，可是月底的开支把我全部的资源分配完了。不知道孩子将来的命运，我是死不瞑目的；我真想握着你温暖的手，听到你神圣的诺言；但是来不及了。在查理赶路的时间，我要把资产负债表造起。我要以业务的规矩诚实，证明我这次的失败既没有过失也没有私弊。这不是为了查理吗！——别了，大哥。我付托给你的监护权，我相信你一定会慷慨地接受，愿上帝为此赐福给你。在彼世界上，永久有一个声音在为你祈祷。那儿我们早晚都要去的，而我已经在那里了。

维克多—安越—琪奥默·葛朗台

“嗯，你们在谈天吗？”葛朗台把信照原来的折痕折好，放在背心口袋里。

他因为心绪不宁，做着种种盘算，便故意装出谦卑而胆怯的神气望着侄儿说：

“烤了火，暖和了吗？”

“舒服得很，伯父。”

“哎，娘儿们到哪里去了？”

他已经忘了侄儿是要住在他家里的。

这时欧也妮和葛朗台太太正好回到堂屋。

“楼上什么都收拾好了吧？”老头儿的心又定了下来。

“收拾好了，父亲。”

“好吧，查理，你觉得累，就叫拿侬带你上去。我的妈，那可不是漂亮哥儿住的房间哦！原谅我们种葡萄的穷人，都给捐税刮光了。”

“我们不打搅了，葛朗台，”银行家插嘴道，“你跟令侄一定有话谈。我们走了。明儿见。”

一听这几句话，大家站起身来告别，各人照着各人的派头行礼。老公证人到门口找出灯笼点了，提议先送台·格拉桑一家回去。台·格拉桑太太没料到中途出了事，散得这么早，家里的当差还没有来接。

“太太，肯不肯赏脸，让我搀着你走？”克罗旭神父对台·格拉桑太太说。

“谢谢你，神父，有孩子招呼我呢。”她冷冷地回答。

“太太们跟我一块儿走是没有嫌疑的。”神父说。

“喂，就让克罗旭先生把你搀着吧。”她的丈夫接口说。

神父搀着美丽的太太，故意轻快地走在众人前面。

“这青年很不错啊，太太，”他紧紧抓着她的胳膊说，“葡萄割完，篮子没用了！事情吹啦。你休想葛朗台小姐了，欧也妮是给那个巴黎人的喽。除非这个堂兄弟爱上什么巴黎女子，令郎阿道夫遇到了一个最……的敌手……”

“别这么说，神父。回头他就会发觉欧也妮是一个傻姑娘，一点儿娇嫩都谈不上。你把她打量过没有？今晚上她脸孔黄得像木瓜。”

“这一点也许你已经提醒堂兄弟了？”

“老实不客气……”

“太太，你以后永远坐在欧也妮旁边，那么不用对那个青年人多说他堂姊的坏话，他自己会比较，而且对……”

“他已经答应后天上我们家吃晚饭。”

“啊！要是你愿意的话，太太……”神父说。

“愿意什么，神父？是不是想教坏我？天哪，我一生清白，活到了三十九岁，总不成再来糟蹋自己的声名，哪怕是为了得蒙古大皇帝的天下！你我在这个年纪上都知道说话应该有个分寸。以你教士的身份，你的念头真是太不像话了。呸！倒像《福勃拉》[4]书中的……”

“那么你念过《福勃拉》了？”

“不，神父，我是说《男子可畏》那部小说。”

“啊！这部书正经多了，”神父笑道，“你把我当作像现在的青年一样坏！我不过想劝你……”

“你敢说你不是想替我出坏主意吗？事情还不明白？这青年人固然不错，我承认，要是他追求我，他当然不会想到他的堂姊了。在巴黎，我知道，有一般好妈妈为了儿女的幸福跟财产，不惜来这么一手；可是咱们是在内地呀，神父。”

“对，太太。”

“并且，”她又说，“哪怕是一万万的家私，我也不愿意用这种代价去换，阿道夫也不愿意。”

“太太，我没有说什么一万万。诱惑来的时候，恐怕你我都抵抗不了。不过我认为一个清白的女子，只要用意不差，无伤大雅的调调情也未始不可，交际场中，这也是女人的一种责任……”

“真的吗？”

“太太，我们不是都应当讨人喜欢吗？……对不起，我要擤一下鼻子。真的，太太，”他接下去说，“他拿手眼镜照你，比他照我的时候，神气似乎要来得亲热一些；自然，我原谅他爱美甚于敬老……”

“显而易见，”所长在后面用他粗嗄而洪大的声音说，“巴黎的葛朗台打发儿子到索漠来，完全是为了亲事……”

“那么堂兄弟就不至于来得这么突兀了。”公证人回答。

“那倒不一定，”台·格拉桑先生表示意见，“那家伙一向喜欢藏头露尾的。”

“喂，台·格拉桑，”他太太插嘴道，“我已经请他来吃晚饭了，那小伙子。你再去邀上拉索尼埃夫妇，杜·奥多阿一家，还有那美丽的杜·奥多阿小姐；噢，但愿她那一天穿得像个样子！她母亲真会忌妒，老把她扮得那么丑！”她又停下脚步对三位克罗旭说：“希望你们也赏光。”

“你们到了，太太。”公证人说。

三位克罗旭别了三位台·格拉桑回家，一路上拿出内地人长于分析的本领，把当晚那件大事从各方面推敲了一番。为了这件事，克罗旭和台·格拉桑两家的关系有了变化。支配这些大策略家行事的世故，使双方懂得暂时有联合对付共同敌人的必要。他们不是应该协力同心阻止欧也妮爱上堂兄弟，阻止查理想到堂姊吗？他们要用花言巧语去阴损人家，表面上恭维，骨子里诋毁，时时刻刻说些似乎天真而别有用心的话。那巴黎人是否能够抵抗这些手段，不上他们的当呢？

赶到堂屋里只剩下四个家属的时候，葛朗台对侄儿说道：

“该睡觉了。夜深了，你到这儿来的事不能再谈了；明天再挑个合适的时间吧。我们八点吃早饭；中午随便吃一点儿水果跟面包，喝一杯白酒；五点吃晚饭，像巴黎人一样。这是我们的规矩。你想到城里城外去玩儿吧，尽管自便。原谅我很忙，没有工夫老是陪你。说不定你会到处听见人家说我有钱：这里是葛朗台先生的，那里又是葛朗台先生的。我让他们说，这些废话不会破坏我的信用。可是我实在没有钱，到了这个年纪，还像做伙计的一样，全部家当只有一双手和一只蹩脚刨子。你不久或许自己会明白，要流着汗去挣一个钱是多么辛苦。喂，拿侬，把蜡烛拿来。”

“侄儿，我想你屋子里用的东西大概都齐了，”葛朗台太太说，“缺少什么，尽管吩咐拿侬。”

“不会吧，伯母，我什么都带齐的！希望你跟大姊都睡得好。”

查理从拿侬手里接过一支点着的白烛，安育城里的货色，铺子里放久了，颜色发黄，初看跟蜡烛差不多；葛朗台根本想不到家里有白烛，也就不会发觉这件奢侈品。

“我来带路。”他说。

照例应当从大门里边的环洞中出去，葛朗台却郑重其事地走堂屋与厨房之间的过道上楼。过道与楼梯中间隔着一扇门，嵌着椭圆形的大玻璃，挡一下楼梯洞里的冷气。但是到了冬天，虽然堂屋的门上下四周都钉着绒布条子，照样有尖利的冷风钻进来，使里面不容易保持相当的温度。

拿侬把大门上锁，关起堂屋，到马房里放出那条声音老是发嗄，仿佛害什么喉头炎似的狼狗。这畜生凶猛无比，只认得拿侬一人。他们都是乡下出身，所以彼此了解。查理看到楼梯间墙壁发黄，到处是烟熏的痕迹，扶手全给虫蛀了的楼梯，在伯父沉重的脚下颤抖，他的美梦更加吹得无影无踪了；他疑心走进了一座鸡棚，不由得转身望望他的伯母与堂姊；她们却是走惯这座楼梯的，根本没有猜到他为什么惊讶，还以为他表示亲热，便对他很愉快地一笑，越发把他气坏了。

“父亲送我到这儿来见什么鬼呀！”他心里想。

到了楼上，他看见三扇土红色的门，没有门框子，嵌在剥落的墙壁里，钉着两头作火舌形的铁条，就像长长的锁眼两端的花纹。正对楼梯的那扇门，一望而知是堵死了的。这间屋正好在厨房上面，只能从葛朗台的卧房进去，是他办事的密室，独一无二的窗洞临着院子，装着粗大的铁栅。

这间房，不用说别人，连葛朗台太太都不准进去，他要独自守在里面，好似炼丹师守护丹炉一般。这儿，他准是很巧妙地安排下什么密窟，藏着田契屋契之类，挂着称金路易的天平，更深夜静地躲在这里写凭据、收条，做种种计算；所以一般生意人永远看到葛朗台样样都有准备，以为他有什么鬼使神差供他驱遣似的。当拿侬打鼾的声音震动楼板，狼狗在院中巡逻、打呵欠，欧也妮母女俩沉沉酣睡的时候，老箍桶匠一定在这儿眯着眼睛观赏黄金，摩挲把玩，装入桶内，套上箍套。密室的墙壁既厚实，护窗也严密。钥匙只有他一个人有。据说他还在这儿研究图样，上面连果树都注明的，他核算他的出产，数字的准确至多是一根葡萄秧一捆柴的上下。

这扇堵死的门对面是欧也妮的房门。楼梯道的尽头是老夫妇俩的卧室，占据了整个前楼的位置。葛朗台太太和女儿的屋子是相连的，中间隔一扇玻璃门。葛朗台和太太的两间卧室，有板壁分隔，密室与他的卧房之间是厚实的墙。

葛朗台老头把侄儿安置在三楼上，那间高爽的顶楼正好在他的卧室上面，如果侄儿高兴起来在房内走动，他可以听得清清楚楚。

欧也妮和母亲走到楼梯道中间，互相拥抱道别；她又对查理说了几句告别的话，在嘴上很冷淡，在姑娘的心里一定是很热的；然后她们各自进房。

“这是你的卧房了，侄儿，”葛朗台一边开门一边说，“要出去，先叫拿侬。没有她，对不起！咱们的狗会一声不响把你吃掉。好好睡吧——再见。嗨！嗨！娘儿们给你生了火啦。”

这时长脚拿侬提着脚炉进来了。

“哦，又是一个！”葛朗台说，“你把我侄儿当作临产的女人吗？把脚炉拿下去，拿侬！”

“先生，被单还潮着呢，再说，侄少爷真是娇嫩得像女人一样。”

“也罢，既然你存心讨好他，”葛朗台把她肩膀一推，“可是留神，别失火。”

吝啬鬼一路下楼，不知嘟囔些什么。

查理站在行李堆中愣住了。这间顶楼上的卧房，那种黄底小花球的糊壁纸，像小酒店里用的；粉石的壁炉架，线条像沟槽一般，望上一眼就叫你发冷；黄椅子的草坐垫涂过油，似乎不止有四只角；床几的大肚子打开着，容得下一个轻骑兵；稀薄的脚毯上边是一张有顶的床，满是蛀洞的帐幔摇摇欲坠。查理一件件地看过了，又一本正经地望着长脚拿侬，说道：

“嗨！嗨！好嫂子，这当真是葛朗台先生的府上吗，当过索漠区长，巴黎葛朗台先生的哥哥吗？”

“对呀，先生，一个多可爱、多和气、多好的老爷哪。要不要帮你打开箱子？”

“好啊，怎么不要呢，我的兵大爷！你没有在帝国军队中当过水手吗？”

“噢！噢！噢！”拿侬叫道，“什么？帝国军队的水手？淡的还是咸的？走水路的吗？”

“来，把钥匙拿去，在这口提箱里替我把睡衣找出来。”

一件金线绣花古式图案的绿绸睡衣，把拿侬看呆了。

“你穿了这个睡觉吗？”

“是呀。”

“哎哟！圣母玛利亚！披在祭坛上做桌围才合适呢。我的好少爷，把它捐给教堂吧，包你上天堂，要不然你的灵魂就没有救啦。噢！你穿了多好看。我要叫小姐来瞧一瞧。”

“喂，拿侬，别嚷，好不好？让我睡觉，我明儿再来整东西；你看中我的睡衣，就让你拿去救你的灵魂吧。我是诚心的基督徒，临走一定留下来，你爱怎么办就怎么办吧。”

拿侬呆呆地站在那里，端详着查理，不敢相信他的话。

“把这件漂亮衣衫给我？”她一边走一边说，“他已经在说梦话了，这位少爷。明儿见。”

“明儿见，拿侬。”查理入睡之前又想，“我到这儿来干什么呢？父亲不是一个呆子，叫我来必有目的。好吧，正经事，明儿想，不知哪个希腊的笨伯说的。”

欧也妮祈祷的时候忽然停下来想道：“圣母玛利亚，多漂亮呀，这位堂兄弟！”这天晚上她的祷告就没有做完。

葛朗台太太临睡的时候一点儿念头都没有。从板壁正中的小门中间，她听见老头儿在房内踱来踱去。像所有胆小的女人一样，她早已识得老爷的脾气。海鸥预知雷雨，她也能从微妙莫测的征兆上面，预感到葛朗台心中的风暴，于是就像她自己所说的，她装作假死。

葛朗台望着那扇里边有铁板的密室的门，想：

“亏我兄弟想得出，把儿子送给我！嘿，这笔遗产才有趣哩！我可是没有一百法郎给他。而且一百法郎对这个花花公子中什么用？他拿手眼镜照我晴雨表的气概，就像要放一把火把它烧掉似的。”

葛朗台想着那份痛苦的遗嘱可能发生的后果，心绪也许比兄弟写的时候还要乱。

“我真的会到手这件金线衣衫吗？……”拿侬自言自语地说。她睡熟的时候，已经穿上了祭坛的桌围，破天荒第一遭地梦见许多鲜花，地毯，绫罗绸缎，正如欧也妮破天荒第一遭地梦见爱情。

内地的爱情


少女们纯洁而单调的生活中，必有一个美妙的时间，阳光会流入她们的心坎，花会对她们说话，心的跳动会把热烈的生机传给头脑，把意念融为一种渺茫的欲望；真是哀而不怨，乐而忘返的境界！儿童睁眼看到世界就笑，少女在大自然中发现感情就笑，像她儿时一样的笑。要是光明算得人生第一个恋爱对象，那么恋爱不就是心的光明吗？欧也妮终于到了把世界上的东西看明白的时候了。

跟所有内地姑娘一样，她起身很早，祷告完毕，开始梳妆，从今以后梳妆是一件有意义的事情了。她先把栗色的头发梳顺溜，很仔细地把粗大的辫子盘上头顶，不让零星短发从辫子里散出来，发髻的式样改成对称，越发烘托出她一脸的天真与娇羞；头饰的简朴与面部线条的单纯配得很调和。拿清水洗了好几次手，那是平日早已浸得通红，皮肤也变得粗糙了的，她望着一双滚圆的胳膊，私忖堂兄弟怎么能把手养得又软又白，指甲修得那么好看。她换上新袜，套上最体面的鞋子；一口气束好了胸，一个眼子都没有跳过。总之，她有生以来第一次希望自己显得漂亮，第一次懂得有一件裁剪合适、使她惹人注目的新衣衫的乐趣。

穿扮完了，她听见教堂的钟声，很奇怪地只数到七下，因为想要有充分的时间梳妆，不觉起得太早了。她既不懂一卷头发可以做上十来次，来研究它的效果，就只能老老实实抱着手臂，坐在窗下望着院子、小园和城墙上居高临下的平台；一派凄凉的景色，也望不到远处，但也不无那种神秘的美，为冷静的地方或荒凉的野外所特有的。

厨房旁边有口井，围着井栏，辘轳吊在一个弯弯的铁杆上。绕着铁杆有一株葡萄藤，那时枝条已经枯萎，变红；蜿蜒曲折的蔓藤从这儿爬上墙，沿着屋子，一直伸展到柴房顶上。堆在那里的木柴，跟藏书家的图书一样整齐。院子里因为长着青苔、野草，无人走动，日子久了，石板都是黑黝黝的。厚实的墙上披着绿荫，波浪似的挂着长长的褐色枝条。院子底上，通到花园门有八级向上的石磴，东倒西歪，给高大的植物淹没了，好似十字军时代一个寡妇埋葬她骑士的古墓。剥落的石基上面，竖着一排腐烂的木栅，一半已经毁了，却还布满各种藤萝，乱七八糟地扭作一团。栅门两旁，伸出两株瘦小的苹果树丫枝。园中有三条平行的小径，铺有细砂；小径之间是花坛，四周种了黄杨，借此堵住花坛的泥土；园子地上是一片菩提树荫，靠在平台脚下。一头是些杨梅树，另一头是一株高大无比的胡桃树，树枝一直伸到箍桶匠的密室外面。那日正是晴朗的天气，碰上洛阿河畔秋天常有的好太阳，使铺在幽美的景物、墙垣、院子和花园里树木上的初霜，开始融化。

欧也妮对那些素来觉得平淡无奇的景色，忽而体会到一种新鲜的情趣。千思百念，渺渺茫茫地在心头涌起，外界的阳光一点点的照开去，胸中的思绪也越来越多。她终于感到一阵模糊的、说不出的愉快把精神包围了，犹如外界的物体给云雾包围了一样。她的思绪，跟这奇特的风景连细枝小节都配合上了，心中的和谐与自然界的融成一片。

一堵墙上挂着浓密的凤尾草，草叶的颜色像鸽子的颈项一般时刻变化。阳光照到这堵墙上的时候，仿佛天国的光明照出了欧也妮将来的希望。从此她就爱这堵墙，爱看墙上的枯草，褪色的花，蓝的灯笼花，因为其中有她甜蜜的回忆，跟童年往事一样。有回声的院子里，每逢她心中暗暗发问的时候，枝条上每片落叶的声响就是回答。她可能整天待在这儿，不觉得时光飞逝。

然后她又心中乱糟糟的，骚动起来，不时站起身子，走过去照镜，好比一个有良心的作家打量自己的作品，想吹毛求疵地挑剔一番。

“我的相貌配不上他！”

这是欧也妮的念头，又谦卑又痛苦的念头。可怜的姑娘太瞧不起自己了；可是谦虚，或者不如说惧怕，的确是爱情的主要德行之一。像欧也妮那样的小布尔乔亚，都是身体结实，美得有点儿俗气的；可是她虽然跟弥罗岛上的爱神[1]相仿，却有一般隽永的基督徒气息，把她的外貌变得高雅，纯净，有点儿灵秀之气，为古代雕刻家没有见识过的。她的脑袋很大，前额带点儿男相，可是很清秀，像斐狄阿斯[2]的丘比特雕像；贞洁的生活使她灰色的眼睛光芒四射。圆脸上娇嫩红润的线条，生过天花之后变得粗糙了，幸而没有留下痘瘢，只去掉了皮肤上绒样的那一层，但依旧那么柔软细腻，会给妈妈的亲吻留下一道红印。她的鼻子大了一点儿，可是配上朱红的嘴巴倒很合适；满是纹路的嘴唇，显出无限的深情与善意。脖子是滚圆的。遮得密不透风的饱满的胸部，惹起人家的注意与幻想。当然她因为装束的关系，缺少一点儿妩媚；但在鉴赏家心目中，那个不甚灵活的姿态也别有风韵。所以，高大壮健的欧也妮并没有一般人喜欢的那种漂亮，但她的美是一望而知的，只有艺术家才会倾倒的。有的画家希望在尘世找到圣洁如玛利亚那样的典型：眼神要像拉斐尔所揣摩到的那么不亢不卑；而理想中的线条，又往往是天生的，只有基督徒贞洁的生活才能培养，保持。醉心于这种模型的画家，会发现欧也妮脸上就有种天生的高贵，连她自己都不曾觉察的：安静的额角下面，藏着整个的爱情世界；眼睛的模样，眼皮的动作，有股说不出的神明的气息。她的线条，面部的轮廓，从没有为了快乐的表情而有所改变，而显得疲倦，仿佛平静的湖边，水天相接之处那些柔和的线条。恬静、红润的脸色，光彩像一朵盛开的花，使你心神安定，感觉到它那股精神的魅力，不由不凝眸注视。

欧也妮还在人生的边上给儿童的幻象点缀得花团锦簇，还在天真烂漫的，采朵雏菊占卜爱情的阶段。她并不知道什么叫作爱情，只照着镜子想：“我太丑了，他看不上我的！”

随后她打开正对楼梯的房门，探着脖子听屋子里的声音。她听见拿侬早上惯有的咳嗽，走来走去，打扫堂屋，生火，缚住狼狗，在牛房里对牲口说话。她想：

“他还没有起来呢。”

她立刻下楼，跑到正在挤牛奶的拿侬前面。

“拿侬，好拿侬，做些乳酪给堂兄弟喝咖啡吧。”

“哎，小姐，那是要隔天做起来的，”拿侬大笑着说，“今天我没法做乳酪了。哎，你的堂兄弟生得标致，标致，真标致。你没瞧见他穿了那件金线纺绸睡衣的模样呢。嗯，我瞧见了。他细洁的衬衫跟本堂神父披的白祭衣一样。”

“拿侬，那么咱们弄些千层饼吧。”

“烤炉用的木柴谁给呢？还有面包，还有牛油？”拿侬说。她以葛朗台先生的总管资格，有时在欧也妮母女的心目中特别显得有权有势。“总不成为了款待你的堂兄弟，偷老爷的东西。你可以问他要牛奶、面粉、木柴，他是你的爸爸，会给你的。哦，他下楼招呼食粮来啦……”

欧也妮听见楼梯在父亲脚下震动，吓得往花园里溜了。一个人快乐到极点的时候，往往——也许不无理由——以为自己的心思全摆在脸上，给人家一眼就会看透；这种过分的羞怯与心虚，对欧也妮已经发生作用。可怜的姑娘终于发觉了自己的屋子冷冰冰的一无所有，怎么也配不上堂兄弟的风雅，觉得很气恼。她很热烈地感到非给他做一点儿什么不可；做什么呢？不知道。天真，老实，她听凭纯朴的天性自由发挥，并没对自己的印象和情感有所顾虑。一看见堂兄弟，女性的倾向就在她心中觉醒了，而且来势特别猛烈，因为到了二十三岁，她的智力与欲望都已经达到高峰。她第一次见了父亲害怕，悟出自己的命运原来操在他的手里，认为有些心事瞒着他是一桩罪过。她脚步匆忙地在那儿走，很奇怪地觉得空气比平时新鲜，阳光比平时更有生气，给她精神上添上了些暖意，给了她新生命。

她正在想用什么计策弄到千层饼，长脚拿侬和葛朗台却斗起嘴来。他们之间的吵架是像冬天的燕子一样少有的。老头儿拿了钥匙预备分配当天的食物，问拿侬：

“昨天的面包还有的剩吗？”

“连小屑子都没有了，先生。”

葛朗台从那只安育地方做面包用的平底篮里，拿出一个糊满干面的大圆面包，正要动手去切，拿侬说：

“咱们今儿是五个人吃饭呢，先生。”

“不错，”葛朗台回答，“可是这个面包有六磅重，还有的剩呢。这些巴黎人简直不吃面包，你等会儿瞧吧。”

“他们只吃馅子吗？”拿侬问。

在安育一带，俗语所说的馅子，是指涂在面包上的东西，包括最普通的牛油到最贵族化的桃子酱。凡是小时候舐光了馅子、面包剩下来的人，准懂得上面的那句话的意思。

“不，”葛朗台回答，“他们既不吃馅子，也不吃面包，就像快要出嫁的姑娘一样。”

他吩咐了几样顶便宜的菜，关起杂货柜正要走向水果房，拿侬把他拦住了说：

“先生，给我一些面粉跟牛油，替孩子们做一个千层饼吧。”

“为了我的侄儿，你想毁掉我的家吗？”

“为你的侄儿，我并不比为你的狗多费什么心，也不见得比你自己多费心……你瞧，你只给我六块糖！我要八块呢。”

“哎哟！拿侬，我从来没看见你这个样子，这算什么意思？你是东家吗？糖，就只有六块。”

“那么侄少爷的咖啡里放什么？”

“两块喽，我可以不用的。”

“在你这个年纪不用糖？我掏出钱来给你买吧。”

“不相干的事不用你管。”

那时糖虽然便宜，老箍桶匠始终觉得是最珍贵的舶来品，要六法郎一磅。帝政时代大家不得不省用糖，在他却成了牢不可破的习惯。

所有的女人，哪怕是最蠢的，都会用手段来达到她们的目的：拿侬丢开了糖的问题，来争取千层饼了。

“小姐，”她隔着窗子叫道，“你不是要吃千层饼吗？”

“不要，不要。”欧也妮回答。

“好吧，拿侬，”葛朗台听见了女儿的声音，“拿去吧。”

他打开面粉柜舀了一点儿给她，又在早先切好的牛油上面补了几两。

“还要烤炉用的木柴呢。”拿侬毫不放松。

“你要多少就拿多少吧，”他无可奈何地回答，“可是你得给我们做一个果子饼，晚饭也在烤炉上煮，不用生两个炉子了。”

“嘿！那还用说！”

葛朗台用着差不多像慈父一般的神气，对忠实的管家望了一眼。

“小姐，”厨娘嚷道，“咱们有千层饼吃了。”

葛朗台捧了许多水果回来，先把一盆的量放在厨房桌上。

“你瞧，先生，”拿侬对他说，“侄少爷的靴子多好看，什么皮呀！多好闻哪！拿什么东西上油呢？要不要用你鸡蛋清调的鞋油？”

“拿侬，我怕蛋清要弄坏这种皮的。你跟他说不会擦摩洛哥皮就是了……不错，这是摩洛哥皮；他自己会到城里买鞋油给你的；听说那种鞋油里面还掺白糖，叫它发亮呢。”

“这么说来，还可以吃的了？”拿侬把靴子凑近鼻尖，“哟！哟！跟太太的科隆水一样香！好玩！”

“好玩！靴子比穿的人还值钱，你觉得好玩？”

他把果子房锁上，又回到厨房。

“先生，”拿侬问，“你不想一礼拜来一两次砂锅，款待款待你的……”

“行。”

“那么我得去买肉了。”

“不用，你慢慢给我们炖个野味汤，佃户不会让你闲着的。不过我得关照高诺阿莱打几只乌鸦，这个东西煮汤再好没有了。”

“先生，乌鸦是吃死人的，可是真的？”

“你这个傻瓜，拿侬！它们还不是跟大家一样有什么吃什么。难道我们就不吃死人了吗？什么叫作遗产呢？”

葛朗台老头没有什么吩咐了，掏出表来，看到早饭之前还有半点钟工夫，便拿起帽子拥抱了一下女儿，对她说：

“你高兴上洛阿河边遛遛吗，到我的草原上去？我在那边有点儿事。”

欧也妮跑去戴上系有粉红缎带的草帽，然后父女俩走下七转八弯的街道，直到广场。

“一大早往哪儿去呀？”公证人克罗旭遇见了葛朗台问。

“有点儿事。”老头儿回答，心里也明白为什么他的朋友清早就出门。

当葛朗台老头有点儿事的时候，公证人凭以往的经验，知道准可跟他弄到些好处，因此就陪了他一块儿走。

“你来，克罗旭，”葛朗台说，“你是我的朋友，我要给你证明，在上好的土地上种白杨是多么傻……”

“这么说来，洛阿河边那块草原给你挣的六万法郎，就不算一回事吗？”克罗旭眨巴着眼睛问，“你还不够运气？……树木砍下的时候，正碰上南德城里白木奇缺，卖到三十法郎一株。”

欧也妮听着，可不知她已经临到一生最重大的关头，至高至上的父母之命，马上要由公证人从老人嘴里逼出来了。

葛朗台到了洛阿河畔美丽的草原上，三十名工人正在收拾从前种白杨的地方，把它填土，挑平。

“克罗旭先生，你来看一株白杨要占多少地。”他提高嗓门唤一个工人，“约翰，拿尺来把四……四……四边量……量……一下！”

工人量完了说：“每边八尺。”

“那就是糟蹋了三十二尺地，”葛朗台对克罗旭说，“这一排上从前我有三百株白杨，是不是？对了……三百……乘三……三十二……尺……就……就……就是五……五……五百棵干草；加上两旁的，一千五；中间的几排又是一千五。就……就算一千堆干草吧。”

“像这类干草，”克罗旭帮着计算道，“一千堆值到六百法郎。”

“算……算……算它一千两百法郎，因为割过以后再长出来的，还好卖到三四百法郎。那么，你算算一年一千……千……两百法郎，四十年……下……下……下来该多多少，加上你……你知道的利……利……利上滚利。”

“一起总该有六万法郎吧。”公证人说。

“得啦！只……只有六万法郎是不是？”老头儿往下说，这一回可不再结结巴巴了，“不过，两千株四十年的白杨还卖不到五万法郎，这不就是损失？给我算出来喽。”葛朗台说到这里，大有自命不凡之概，“约翰，你把窟窿都填平，只留下河边的那一排，把我买来的白杨种下去。种在河边，它们就靠公家长大了。”他对克罗旭补上这句，鼻子上的肉瘤微微扯动一下，仿佛是挖苦得最凶的冷笑。

“自然喽，白杨只好种在荒地上。”克罗旭这么说，心里给葛朗台的算盘吓住了。

“可不是，先生！”老箍桶匠带着讥讽的口吻。

欧也妮只顾望着洛阿河边奇妙的风景，没有留神父亲的计算，可是不久克罗旭对她父亲说的话，引起了她的注意：

“哎，你从巴黎招了一个女婿来啦，全个索漠都在谈论你的侄儿。快要叫我立婚书了吧，葛老头？”

“你……你……你清……清……清早出来，就……就……就是要告诉我这个吗？”葛朗台说这句话的时候，扯动着肉瘤，“那么，老……老兄，我不瞒你，你……你要知……知道的，我可以告诉你。我宁可把……把……女……女……女儿丢在洛阿河里，也……也不愿把……把她给……给她的堂……堂……堂兄弟；你不……不……不妨说给人人……人……人家听。啊，不必；让他……他们去胡……胡……胡扯吧。”

这段话使欧也妮一阵眼花。遥远的希望刚刚在她心里萌芽，就开花，长成，结成一个花球，现在她眼看着剪成一片片的，扔在地下。从隔夜起，促成两心相契的一切幸福的联系，已经使她舍不得查理；从今以后，却要由苦难来加强他们的结合了。苦难的崇高与伟大，要由她来担受，幸运的光华与她无缘，这不就是女子的庄严的命运吗？父爱怎么会在她父亲心中熄灭的呢？查理犯了什么滔天大罪呢？不可思议的问题！她初生的爱情已经够神秘了，如今又包上了一团神秘。她两腿哆嗦着回家，走到那条黝黑的老街，刚才是那么喜气洋洋的，此刻却一片荒凉，她感到了时光流转与人事纷纷留在那里的凄凉情调。爱情的教训，她一桩都逃不了。

到了离家只有几步路的地方，她抢着上前敲门，在门口等父亲。葛朗台瞥见公证人拿着原封未动的报纸，便问：

“公债行情怎么样？”

“你不肯听我的话，葛朗台，”克罗旭回答说，“赶紧买吧，两年之内还有两成可赚，并且利率很高，八万法郎有五千息金。行市是八十法郎五十生丁。”

“慢慢再说吧。”葛朗台摸着下巴。

公证人展开报纸，忽然叫道：“我的天！”

“什么事？”葛朗台这么问的时候，克罗旭已经把报纸送在他面前，说：“你念吧。”

巴黎商界巨子葛朗台氏，昨日照例前往交易所，不料返寓后突以手枪击中脑部，自杀殒命。死前曾致书众议院议长及商事裁判所所长，辞去本兼各职。闻葛氏破产，系受经纪人苏希及公证人洛庚之累。以葛氏地位及平素信用而论，原不难于巴黎商界中获得支援，徐图挽救；讵一时情急，遽尔出此下策，殊堪惋惜……

“我早知道了。”老头儿对公证人说。

克罗旭听了这话抽了一口冷气。虽然当公证人的都有镇静的功夫，但想到巴黎的葛朗台也许央求过索漠的葛朗台而被拒绝的时候，他不由得背脊发冷。

“那么他的儿子呢？昨天晚上还多么高兴……”

“他还没有知道。”葛朗台依旧很镇定。

“再见，葛朗台先生。”克罗旭全明白了，立刻去告诉特·篷风所长叫他放心。

回到家里，葛朗台看到早饭预备好了。葛朗台太太已经坐在那张有木座的椅子上，编织冬天用的毛线套袖。欧也妮跑过去拥抱母亲，热烈的情绪，正如我们憋着一肚子说不出的苦恼的时候一样。

“你们先吃吧，”拿侬从楼梯上连奔带爬地下来说，“他睡得像个小娃娃。闭着眼睛，真好看！我进去叫他，嗨，他一声也不回。”

“让他睡吧，”葛朗台说，“他今天起得再晚，也赶得上听他的坏消息。”

“什么事呀？”欧也妮问，一边把两小块不知有几克重的糖放入咖啡。那是老头儿闲着没事的时候切好在那里的，葛朗台太太不敢动问，只望着丈夫。

“他父亲一枪把自己打死了。”

“叔叔吗？”欧也妮问。

“可怜这孩子哪。”葛朗台太太嚷道。

“对啦，可怜，”葛朗台接着说，“他一个钱都没有了。”

“可是他睡的模样，好像整个天下都是他的呢。”拿侬声调很温柔地说。

欧也妮吃不下东西。她的心给揪紧了，就像初次对爱人的苦难表示同情，而全身都为之波动的那种揪心。她哭了。

“你又不认识你叔叔，哭什么？”她父亲一边说，一边饿虎般地瞪了她一眼，他瞪着成堆的金子时想必也是这种眼神。

“可是，先生，”拿侬插嘴道，“这可怜的小伙子，谁见了不替他难受呢？他睡得像木头一样，还不知道飞来横祸呢。”

“拿侬，我不跟你说话，别多嘴。”

欧也妮这时才懂得一个动了爱情的女子永远得隐瞒自己的感情。她不作声了。

“希望你，太太，”老头儿又说，“我出去的时候对他一字都不用提。我要去把草原上靠大路一边的土沟安排一下。我中饭时候回来跟侄儿谈。至于你，小姐，要是你为了这个花花公子而哭，这样也够了。他马上要到印度去，休想再看见他。”

父亲从帽子边上拿起手套，像平时一样不动声色地戴上，交叉着手指把手套扣紧，出门了。

欧也妮等到屋子里只剩她和母亲两个的时候，嚷道：

“啊！妈妈，我要死了。我从来没有这么难受过。”

葛朗台太太看见女儿脸色发白，便打开窗子叫她深呼吸。

“好一点儿了。”欧也妮过了一会儿说。

葛朗台太太看到素来很冷静、很安定的欧也妮，一下子居然神经刺激到这个田地，她凭着一般母亲对于孩子的直觉，马上猜透了女儿的心。事实上，欧也妮母女俩的生命，比两个肉体连在一块的匈牙利孪生姊妹[3]还要密切，她们永远一块儿坐在这个窗洞底下，一块儿上教堂，睡在一座屋子里，呼吸着同样的空气。

“可怜的孩子！”葛朗台太太把女儿的头搂在怀里。

欧也妮听了这话，仰起头来望了望母亲，揣摩她心里是什么意思，末了她说：

“干吗要送他上印度去？他遭了难，不是正应该留在这儿吗？他不是我们的骨肉吗？”

“是的，孩子，应该这样。可是你父亲有他的理由，应当尊重。”

母父俩一声不响地坐着，重新拿起活计，一个坐在有木座子的椅上，一个坐在小靠椅里。欧也妮为了感激母亲深切的谅解，吻着她的手说：

“你多好，亲爱的妈妈！”

这两句话使母亲那张因终身苦恼而格外憔悴的老脸，有了一点儿光彩。

“你觉得他长得体面吗？”欧也妮问。

葛朗台太太只微微笑了一下；过了一会儿她轻轻地说：

“你已经爱上他了是不是？那可不好。”

“不好？为什么不好？”欧也妮说，“你喜欢他，拿侬喜欢他，为什么我不能喜欢他？喂，妈妈，咱们摆起桌子来预备他吃早饭吧。”

她丢下活计，母亲也跟着丢下，嘴里却说：

“你疯了！”

但她自己也跟着发疯，仿佛证明女儿并没有错。

欧也妮叫唤拿侬。

“又是什么事呀，小姐？”

“拿侬，乳酪到中午可以弄好了吧？”

“啊！中午吗？行，行。”老妈子回答。

“还有，他的咖啡要特别浓，我听见台·格拉桑说，巴黎人都喝挺浓的咖啡。你得多放一些。”

“哪儿来这么些咖啡？”

“去买呀。”

“给先生碰到了怎么办？”

“不会，他在草原上呢。”

“那么让我快点儿去吧。不过番查老板给我白烛的时候，已经问咱们家里是不是三王来朝了。这样的花钱，满城都要知道喽。”

“你父亲知道了，”葛朗台太太说，“说不定要打我们呢。”

“打就打吧，咱们跪在地下挨打就是。”

葛朗台太太一言不答，只抬起眼睛望了望天。拿侬戴上头巾，出去了。欧也妮铺上白桌布，又到顶楼上把她好玩地吊在绳上的葡萄摘下几串。她在走廊里蹑手蹑脚，唯恐惊醒了堂兄弟，又禁不住把耳朵贴在房门上，听一听他平匀的呼吸，心里想：

“真叫作无事家中卧，祸从天上来。”

她从葡萄藤上摘下几张最绿的叶子，像侍候筵席的老手一般，把葡萄装得那么好看，然后得意扬扬地端到饭桌上。在厨房里，她把父亲数好的梨全部掳掠了来，在绿叶上堆成一座金字塔。她走来走去，蹦蹦跳跳，恨不得把父亲的家倾箱倒箧地搜刮干净；可是所有的钥匙都在他身上。拿侬揣着两个鲜蛋回来了。欧也妮一看见蛋，简直想跳上拿侬的脖子。

“我看见朗特的佃户篮里有鸡子，就问他要，这好小子，为了讨好我就给我了。”

欧也妮把活计放下了一二十次，去看煮咖啡，听堂兄弟的起床和响动；这样花了两小时的心血，她居然弄好一顿午餐，很简单，也不多花钱，可是家里的老规矩已经破坏完了，照例午餐是站着吃的，各人不过吃一些面包，一个果子，或是一些牛油，外加一杯酒。现在壁炉旁边摆着桌子，堂兄弟的刀叉前面放了一张靠椅，桌上摆了两盆水果，一个蛋盅，一瓶白酒，面包，衬碟内高高地堆满了糖：欧也妮望着这些，想到万一父亲这时候回家瞪着她的那副眼光，不由得四肢哆嗦。因此她一刻不停地望着钟，计算堂兄弟是否能够在父亲回来之前用完早餐。

“放心，欧也妮，要是你爸爸回来，一切归我担当。”葛朗台太太说。欧也妮忍不住掉下一滴眼泪，叫道：

“哦！好妈妈，怎么报答你呢？”

查理哼呀唱呀，在房内不知绕了多少圈，终于下楼了，还好，时间不过十一点。这巴黎人！他穿扮得花哨，仿佛在苏格兰的那位贵妇人爵府上做客。他进门时那副笑盈盈的怪和气的神情，配上青春年少多么合适，叫欧也妮看了又快活又难受。意想中伯父的行宫别墅，早已成为空中楼阁，他却嘻嘻哈哈地满不在乎，很高兴地招呼他的伯母：

“伯母，你昨夜睡得好吗？还有你呢，大姊？”

“很好，侄少爷，你自己呢？”葛朗台太太回答。

“我么？睡得好极了。”

“你一定饿了，弟弟，”欧也妮说，“来用早点吧。”

“中午以前我从来不吃东西，那时我才起身呢。不过路上的饭食太坏了，不妨随便一点儿，而且……”

说着他掏出勃莱甘造的一只最细巧的平底表。

“咦，只有十一点，我起早了。”

“早了？”葛朗台太太问。

“是呀，可是我要整东西。也罢，有东西吃也不坏，随便什么都行，家禽喽，鹧鸪喽。”

“啊，圣母玛利亚！”拿侬听了不禁叫起来。

“鹧鸪！”欧也妮心里想，她恨不得把全部私蓄去买一只鹧鸪。

“这儿坐吧。”伯母招呼他。

花花公子懒洋洋地倒在靠椅中，好似一个漂亮女子摆着姿势坐在一张半榻上。欧也妮和母亲端了两张椅子在壁炉前面，坐在他旁边。

“你们终年住在这儿吗？”查理问。他发觉堂屋在白天比在灯光底下更丑了。

“是的，”欧也妮望着他回答，“除非收割葡萄的时候，我们去帮一下拿侬，住在诺阿伊哀修道院里。”

“你们从来不出去遛遛吗？”

“有时候，星期日做完了晚祷，天晴的话，”葛朗台太太回答，“我们到桥边去，或者在割草的季节去看割草。”

“这儿有戏院没有？”

“看戏！”葛朗台太太嚷道，“看戏子！哎哟，侄少爷，难道你不知道这是该死的罪孽吗？”

“喂，好少爷，”拿侬捧着鸡子进来说，“请你尝尝带壳子鸡。”

“哦！新鲜的鸡子？”查理叫道。他正像那些惯于奢华的人一样，已经把他的鹧鸪忘掉了，“好极了！可有些牛油吗，好嫂子？”

“啊！牛油！那么你们不想吃千层饼了？”老妈子说。

“把牛油拿来，拿侬！”欧也妮叫道。

少女留神瞧着堂兄弟把面包切成小块，觉得津津有味，正如巴黎最多情的女工，看一出好人得胜的戏一样。查理受过极有涵养的母亲教养，又给一个时髦女子琢磨过了，的确有些爱娇而文雅的小动作，颇像一个风骚的情妇。少女的同情与温柔，真有磁石般的力量。查理一看见堂姊与伯母对他的体贴，觉得那股潮水般向他冲来的感情，简直没法抗拒。他对欧也妮又慈祥又怜爱地瞧了一眼，充满了笑意。把欧也妮端详之下，他觉得纯洁的脸上线条和谐到极点，态度天真，清朗有神的眼睛闪出年轻的爱情，只有愿望而没有肉欲的成分。

“老实说，亲爱的大姊，要是你盛装坐在巴黎歌剧院的花楼里，我敢保证伯母的话没有错，你要叫男人动心，叫女人妒忌，他们全得犯罪呢。”

这番恭维虽然使欧也妮莫名其妙，却把她的心抓住了，快乐得直跳。

“噢！弟弟，你取笑我这个可怜的乡下姑娘。”

“要是你识得我的脾气，大姊，你就知道我是最恨取笑的人：取笑会使一个人的心干枯，伤害所有的情感。”

说罢他有模有样地吞下一小块涂着牛油的面包。

“对了，大概我没有取笑人家的聪明，所以吃亏不少。在巴黎，‘他心地好呀’这样的话，可以把一个人羞得无处容身。因为这句话的意思是‘其蠢似牛’。但是我，因为有钱，谁都知道我拿起随便什么手枪，三十步外第一下就能打中靶子，而且还是在野地里，所以没有人敢开我玩笑。”

“侄儿，这些话就证明你的心好。”

“你的戒指漂亮极了，”欧也妮说，“给我瞧瞧不妨事吧？”

查理伸手脱下戒指，欧也妮的指尖，和堂兄弟粉红的指甲轻轻碰了一下，马上脸红了。

“妈妈，你看，多好的手工。”

“噢！多少金子啊。”拿侬端了咖啡进来，说。

“这是什么？”查理笑着问，他指着一个又高又瘦的土黄色的陶壶，上过釉彩，里边搪瓷的，四周堆着一圈灰土；里面的咖啡冲到面上又往底下翻滚。

“煮滚的咖啡呀。”拿侬回答。

“啊！亲爱的伯母，既然我在这儿住，至少得留下些好事做纪念。你们太落伍了！我来教你们怎样用夏伯太咖啡壶来煮成好咖啡。”

接着他解释用夏伯太咖啡壶的一套方法。

“哎哟，这样麻烦，”拿侬说，“要花上一辈子的工夫。我才不高兴这样煮咖啡呢。不是吗，我煮了咖啡，谁给咱们的母牛割草呢？”

“我来割。”欧也妮接口。

“孩子！”葛朗台太太望着女儿。

这句话，把马上要临到这可怜的青年头上的祸事，提醒了大家，三个妇女一齐闭口，不胜怜悯地望着他，使他大吃一惊。

“什么事，大姊？”

欧也妮正要回答，被母亲喝住了：

“嘘！孩子，你知道父亲会对先生说的……”

“叫我查理吧。”年轻的葛朗台说。

“啊！你名叫查理？多美丽的名字！”欧也妮叫道。

凡是预感到的祸事，差不多全会来的。拿侬，葛朗台太太和欧也妮，想到老箍桶匠回家就会发抖的，偏偏听到那么熟悉的门锤声响了一下。

“爸爸来了！”欧也妮叫道。

她在桌布上留下了几块糖，把糖碟子收了。拿侬把盛鸡蛋的盘子端走。葛朗台太太笔直地站着，像一头受惊的小鹿。这一场突如其来的惊慌，弄得查理莫名其妙。他问：

“嗨，嗨，你们怎么啦？”

“爸爸来了呀。”欧也妮回答。

“那又怎么样？”

葛朗台进来，尖利的眼睛望了望桌子，望了望查理，什么都明白了。

“啊！啊！你们替侄儿摆酒，好吧，很好，好极了！”他一点儿都不口吃地说，“猫儿上了屋，耗子就在地板上跳舞啦。”

“摆酒？”查理暗中奇怪。他想象不到这份人家的伙食和生活习惯。

“把我的酒拿来，拿侬。”老头儿吩咐。

欧也妮端了一杯给他。他从荷包里掏出一把面子很阔的牛角刀，割了一块面包，拿了一些牛油，很仔细地涂上了，就地站着吃起来。这时查理正把糖放入咖啡。葛朗台一眼瞥见那么些糖，便打量着他的女人，她脸色发白地走了过来。他附在可怜的老婆耳边问：

“哪儿来的这么些糖？”

“拿侬上番查铺子买的，家里没有了。”

这默默无声的一幕使三位女人怎样地紧张，简直难以想象。拿侬从厨房里跑出来，向堂屋内张望，看看事情怎么样。查理尝了尝咖啡，觉得太苦，想再加些糖，已经给葛朗台收起了。

“侄儿，你找什么？”老头儿问。

“找糖。”

“冲些牛奶，咖啡就不苦了。”葛朗台回答。

欧也妮把父亲藏起的糖碟子重新拿来放上桌子，声色不动地打量着父亲。真的，一个巴黎女子帮助情人逃走，用娇弱的胳膊拉住从窗口挂到地下的丝绳那种勇气，也不见得胜过把糖重新放上桌子时欧也妮的勇气。可是巴黎女子是有酬报的，美丽的手臂上每根受伤的血管，都会由情人用眼泪与亲吻来滋润，用快乐来治疗；欧也妮被父亲霹雳般的目光瞪着，惊慌到心都碎了，而这种秘密的痛苦，查理是永远不会得知的。

“你不吃东西吗，太太？”葛朗台问他的女人。

可怜的奴隶走过来恭恭敬敬地切了块面包，捡了一只梨。欧也妮大着胆子请父亲吃葡萄：

“爸爸，尝尝我的干葡萄吧！——弟弟，也吃一点儿好不好？这些美丽的葡萄，我特地为你摘来的。”

“哦！再不阻止的话，她们为了你要把索漠城抢光呢，侄儿。你吃完了，咱们到花园里去；我有事跟你谈，那可是不甜的喽。”

欧也妮和母亲对查理瞅了一眼，那种表情，查理马上懂得了。

“你是什么意思，伯父？自从我可怜的母亲去世以后……（说到母亲二字他的声音软了下来），不会再有什么祸事了……”

“侄儿，谁知道上帝想用什么灾难来磨炼我们呢？”他的伯母说。

“咄，咄，咄，咄！”葛朗台叫道，“又来胡说八道。——侄儿，我看到你这双漂亮雪白的手真难受。”

他指着手臂尽处那双羊肩般的手。

“明明是生来捞钱的手！你的教养，却把我们做公事包放票据用的皮，穿在你脚上。不行哪！不行哪！”

“伯父，你究竟什么意思？我可以赌咒，简直一个字都不懂。”

“来吧。”葛朗台回答。

吝啬鬼把刀子折起，喝干了杯中剩下的白酒，开门出去。

“弟弟，拿出勇气来呀！”

少女的声调叫查理浑身冰冷，他跟着厉害的伯父出去，焦急得要命。拿侬和欧也妮母女，按捺不住好奇心，一齐跑到厨房，偷偷瞧着两位演员，那幕戏就要在潮湿的小花园中演出了。伯父跟侄儿先是不声不响地走着。

说出查理父亲的死讯，葛朗台并没觉得为难，但知道查理一个钱都没有了，倒有些同情，私下想怎样措辞才能把悲惨的事实弄得和缓一些。“你父亲死了”这样的话，没有什么大不了。为父的总死在孩子前面。可是“你一点儿家产都没有了”这句话，却包括了世界上所有的苦难。老头儿在园子中间咯咯作响的沙径上已经走到了第三圈。在一生的重要关头，凡是悲欢离合之事发生的场所，总跟我们的心牢牢地黏在一块。所以查理特别注意到小园中的黄杨，枯萎的落叶，剥落的围墙，奇形怪状的果树，以及一切别有风光的细节；这些都将成为他不可磨灭的回忆，和这个重大的时间永久分不开。因为激烈的情绪有一种特别的记忆力。

葛朗台深深呼了一口气：

“天气真热，真好。”

“是的，伯父，可是为什么？……”

“是这样的，孩子，”伯父接着说，“我有坏消息告诉你。你父亲危险得很……”

“那么我还在这儿干吗？”查理叫道，“拿侬，上驿站去要马！我总该在这里弄到一辆车吧。”他转身向伯父补上一句。可是伯父站着不动。

“车呀马呀都不中用了。”葛朗台瞅着查理回答，查理一声不出，眼睛发呆了。“是的，可怜的孩子，你猜着了。他已经死了。这还不算，还有更严重的事呢，他是用手枪自杀的……”

“我的父亲？”

“是的。可是这还不算。报纸上还有名有分地批评他呢。哦，你念吧。”

葛朗台拿出问克罗旭借来的报纸，把那段骇人的新闻送在查理眼前。可怜的青年这时还是一个孩子，还在极容易流露感情的年纪，他眼泪涌了出来。

“啊，好啦，”葛朗台私下想，“他的眼睛吓了我一跳。现在他哭了，不要紧了。”

“这还不算一回事呢，可怜的侄儿，”葛朗台高声往下说，也不知道查理有没有在听他，“这还不算一回事呢，你慢慢会忘掉的，可是……”

“不会！永远不会！爸爸呀！爸爸呀！”

“他把你的家败光了，你一个钱也没有了。”

“那有什么相干？我的爸爸呢？……爸爸！”

围墙中间只听见号哭与抽噎的声音凄凄惨惨响成一片，而且还有回声。三个女人都感动得哭了：眼泪跟笑声一样会传染的。查理不再听他的伯父说话了，他冲进院子，摸到楼梯，跑到房内横倒在床上，把被窝蒙着脸，预备躲开了亲人痛哭一场。

“让第一阵暴雨过了再说。”葛朗台走进堂屋道。这时欧也妮和母亲急匆匆地回到原位，抹了抹眼泪，颤巍巍的手指重新做起活计来。“可是这孩子没有出息，把死人看得比钱还重。”

欧也妮听见父亲对最圣洁的感情说出这种话，不禁打了个寒噤。从此她就开始批判父亲了。查理的抽噎虽然沉了下去，在这所到处有回声的屋子里仍旧听得清清楚楚；仿佛来自地下的沉痛的呼号，慢慢地微弱，到傍晚才完全止住。

“可怜的孩子！”葛朗台太太说。

这句慨叹可出了事。葛朗台老头瞅着他的女人，瞅着欧也妮和糖碟子，记起了请倒霉侄儿吃的那顿丰盛的早餐，便站在堂屋中央，照例很镇静地说：

“啊！葛朗台太太，希望你以后不要再乱花钱。我的钱不是给你买糖喂那个小浑蛋的。”

“不关母亲的事，”欧也妮说，“是我……”

“你成年了就想跟我闹别扭是不是？”葛朗台截住了女儿的话，“欧也妮，你该想一想……”

“父亲，你弟弟的儿子在你家里总不成连……”

“咄，咄，咄，咄！”老箍桶匠这四个字全是用的半音阶，“又是我弟弟的儿子呀，又是我的侄儿呀。哼，查理跟咱们什么相干？他连一个子儿、半个子儿都没有，他父亲破产了。等这花花公子称心如意地哭够了，就叫他滚蛋；我才不让他把我的家搅得天翻地覆呢。”

“父亲，什么叫作破产？”

“破产，”父亲回答说，“是最丢人的事，比所有丢人的事还要丢人。”

“那一定是罪孽深重啰，”葛朗台太太说，“我们的弟弟要入地狱了吧。”

“得了吧，你又来婆婆妈妈的，”他耸耸肩膀，“欧也妮，破产就是窃盗，可是有法律保护的窃盗。人家凭了琪奥默·葛朗台的信用跟清白的名声，把口粮交给他，他却统统吞没了，只给人家留下一双眼睛落眼泪。破产的人比路劫的强盗还要不得：强盗攻击你，你可以防卫，他也拼着脑袋；至于破产的人……总而言之，查理是丢尽了脸。”

这些话一直响到可怜的姑娘心里，全部说话的分量压在她心头。她天真老实的程度，不下于森林中的鲜花娇嫩的程度，既不知道社会上的教条，也不懂似是而非的论调，更不知道那些骗人的推理；所以她完全相信父亲的解释，不知他是有心把破产说得那么卑鄙，不告诉她有计划的破产跟迫不得已的破产是不同的。

“那么父亲，那桩倒霉事儿你没有法子阻拦吗？”

“兄弟并没有跟我商量，而且他亏空四百万呢。”

“什么叫作一百万，父亲？”她那种天真，好像一个要什么就有什么的孩子。

“一百万？”葛朗台说，“那就是一百万个二十铜子的钱，五个二十铜子的钱才能凑成五法郎。”

“天哪！天哪！叔叔怎么能有四百万呢？法国可有人有这么几百万几百万的吗？”

葛朗台老头摸摸下巴，微微笑着，肉瘤似乎胀大了些。

“那么堂兄弟怎么办呢？”

“到印度去，照他父亲的意思，他应该想法在那儿发财。”

“他有没有钱上那儿去呢？”

“我给他路费……送他到……是的，送他到南德。”

欧也妮跳上去勾住了父亲的脖子。

“啊！父亲，你真好，你！”

她拥抱他的那股劲儿，差一点儿叫葛朗台惭愧，他的良心有些不好过了。

“赚到一百万要很多时候吧？”她问。

“哦，”箍桶匠说，“你知道什么叫作一块拿破仑[4]吧；一百万就得五万拿破仑。”

“妈妈，咱们得替他念‘九天经’吧？”

“我已经想到了。”母亲回答。

“又来了！老是花钱，”父亲嚷道，“啊！你们以为家里几千几百的花不完吗？”

这时顶楼上传来一声格外凄惨的悲啼，把欧也妮和她的母亲吓呆了。

“拿侬，上去瞧瞧：别让他自杀了。”葛朗台这句话把母女俩听得脸色发白，他却转身吩咐她们，“啊！你们，别胡闹。我要走了，跟咱们的荷兰客人打交道去，他们今天动身。过后我得去看克罗旭，谈谈这些事。”

他走了。葛朗台带上大门，欧也妮和母亲呼吸都自由了。那天以前，女儿在父亲前面从来不觉得拘束；但几小时以来，她的感情跟思想时时刻刻都在变化。

“妈妈，一桶酒能卖多少法郎？”

“你父亲的价钱是一百到一百五十，听说有时卖到两百。”

“那么他有一千四百桶收成的时候……”

“老实说，孩子，我不知道那可以卖到多少；你父亲从来不跟我谈他的生意。”

“这么说来，爸爸应该有钱哪。”

“也许是吧。不过克罗旭先生跟我说，他两年以前买了法劳丰。大概他现在手头不宽。”

欧也妮对父亲的财产再也弄不清了。她的计算便至此为止。

“他连看也没看到我，那小少爷！”拿侬下楼说，“他躺在床上像头小牛，哭得像圣女玛特兰纳，真想不到！这可怜的好少爷干吗这样伤心呀？”

“我们赶快去安慰安慰他吧，妈妈；等有人敲门，我们就下楼。”

葛朗台太太抵抗不了女儿那么悦耳的声音。欧也妮变得伟大了，已经是成熟的女人了。

两个人忐忑地上楼，走向查理的卧房。房门打开在那里。查理什么都没有看见，什么都没有听见。他浸在泪水中间，不成音节地在那里哼哼唧唧。

“他对他父亲多好！”欧也妮轻轻地说。

这句话的音调，明明显出她不知不觉已经动了情，存着希望。葛朗台太太慈祥地望了女儿一眼，附在她耳边悄悄地说：

“小心，你要爱上他了。”

“爱他！”欧也妮答道，“你没有听见父亲说的话呢！”

查理翻了一个身，看见了伯母跟堂姊。

“父亲死了，我可怜的父亲！要是他把心中的苦难告诉我，我跟他两个可以想法子挽回啊。我的上帝！我的好爸爸！我以为不久就会看到他的，临走对他就没有什么亲热的表示……”

他一阵呜咽，说不下去了。

“我们为他祷告就是了，”葛朗台太太说，“你得听从主的意思。”

“弟弟，勇敢些！父亲死了是挽回不来的；现在应该挽回你的名誉……”

女人的本能和乖巧，对什么事都很机灵，在安慰人家的时候也是如此；欧也妮想叫堂兄弟关切他自己，好减轻一些痛苦。

“我的名誉？”他猛地把头发一甩，抱着胳膊在床上坐起。

“啊！不错。伯父说我父亲是破产了。”

他凄厉地大叫一声，把手蒙住了脸。

“你走开，大姊，你走开！我的上帝，我的上帝！饶恕我的父亲吧，他已经太痛苦了。”

年轻人的真实的、没有计算、没有作用的痛苦的表现，真是又惨又动人。查理挥手叫她们走开的时候，欧也妮和母亲两颗单纯的心，都懂得这是一种不能让旁人参与的痛苦。她们下楼，默默地回到窗下的座位上，不声不响地工作了一小时。凭着少女们一眼之间什么都看清了的眼睛，欧也妮早已瞥见堂兄弟美丽的梳妆用具，金镶的剪刀和剃刀之类。在痛苦的气氛中看到这种奢华气派，使她对比之下更关切查理。母女俩一向过着平静与孤独的生活，从来没有一桩这样严重的事，一个这样惊心动魄的场面，刺激过她们的幻想。

“妈妈，”欧也妮说，“咱们应该替叔叔戴孝吧？”

“你父亲会决定的。”葛朗台太太回答。

她们又不作声了。欧也妮一针一针缝着，有规律的动作很可使一个旁观的人觉察她内容丰富的冥想。这可爱的姑娘第一个愿望，是想跟堂兄弟一起守丧。

四点光景，门上来势汹汹地敲了一阵，把葛朗台太太骇得心儿直跳，对女儿说：

“你父亲什么事呀？”

葛朗台高高兴兴地进来，脱下手套，两手拼命地搓，几乎把皮肤都擦破，幸而他的表皮像俄国皮那样上过硝似的，只差没有加过香料。他踱来踱去，一刻不停地看钟。临了他心头的秘密泄露了，一点儿也不口吃地说：

“告诉你，太太，他们都中了我的计。咱们的酒卖掉了！荷兰人跟比国人今儿动身，我在广场上闲荡，在他们的旅馆前面，装作无聊的神气。你认识的那家伙就来找我。所有出产好葡萄的人都压着货不肯卖，我自然不去阻拦他们。咱们的比国人可是慌了。我看得清清楚楚。结果是两百法郎一桶成交，一半付现。收到的货款全是黄金。合同已经签下，这六个路易[5]是给你的佣金。再过三个月，酒价一定要跌。”

他说最后一句的时候语气很镇静，可是话中带刺。索漠的人这时挤在广场上，葛朗台的酒脱手的消息已经把他们吓坏了，要是再听到上面的话，他们一定会气得发抖。人心的慌乱可能使酒价跌去一半。

“今年你不是有一千桶酒吗，父亲？”欧也妮问。

“是啊，小乖乖。”

这个称呼是老箍桶匠快乐到了极点的表示。

“可以卖到二十万法郎喽？”

“是的，葛朗台小姐。”

“这样，父亲，你很容易帮查理的忙了。”

当初巴比伦王拜太查，看到神秘的手在墙上预告他的死亡时，他的愤怒与惊愕也不能跟这时葛朗台的怒火相比。他早已把侄儿忘得一干二净，却发觉侄儿始终盘踞在女儿心里，在女儿的计算之中。

“啊，好！这个花花公子一进了我的家，什么都颠倒了。你们摆阔，买糖果，花天酒地地请客。我可不答应。到了这个年纪，我总该知道怎么做人了吧！并且也轮不到女儿，轮不到谁来教训我。应该怎样对付我的侄儿，我就怎样对付。不用你们管。——至于你，欧也妮，”他转过身子对她说，“再不许提到他，要不，我把你跟拿侬一起送到诺阿伊哀修道院去，看我做得到做不到；你再哼一声，明天就打发你走。——他在哪儿，这孩子？下过楼没有？”

“没有，朋友。”葛朗台太太回答。

“他在干什么？”

“哭他的父亲哪。”欧也妮回答。

葛朗台瞪着女儿，想不出话来。他好歹也是父亲啊。在堂屋里转了两下，他急急忙忙上楼，躲进密室去考虑买公债的计划。连根砍掉的两千阿尔邦的林木，卖到六十万法郎；加上白杨，上年和当年的收入，以及最近成交的二十万法郎买卖，总数大概有九十万。公债行情是七十法郎，短时期内好赚二分利，他很想试一试。他拿起记载兄弟死讯的那张报纸，写下数目计算起来，虽然听到侄儿的呻吟，也没有听进耳朵。

拿侬跑来敲敲墙壁请主人下楼，晚饭已经预备好了。走到穹隆下面楼梯的最后一级，葛朗台心里想：

“既然有八厘利，我一定做这笔生意。两年以后可以有一百五十万金洋从巴黎提回来。——哎，侄儿在哪里？”

“他说不要吃饭，”拿侬说，“真是不顾身体。”

“省省我的粮食也好。”主人回答。

“是吧。”她说。

“嘿！他不会永远哭下去的。肚子饿了，树林里的狼也躲不住呢。”

晚饭时候，大家好古怪地不出一声。等到桌布拿掉了，葛朗台太太才说：

“好朋友，咱们该替兄弟戴孝吧。”

“真是，太太，你只晓得想出花钱的玩意儿。戴孝在乎心，不在乎衣服。”

“可是兄弟的孝不能不戴，教会吩咐我们……”

“就在你六个路易里支出，买你们的孝服吧。我只要一块黑纱就行。”

欧也妮抬起眼睛向上望了望，一言不发。她慷慨的天性素来潜伏着，受着压制，第一遭觉醒了，又时时刻刻受到伤害。

这一晚，表面上跟他们单调生活中无数的夜晚一样，但却是最难受的一晚。欧也妮头也不抬地做她的活计，也不动用隔夜被查理看得一文不值的针线匣。葛朗台太太编织她的套袖。葛朗台坐在一边把大拇指绕动了四小时，想着明天会叫索漠全城吃惊的计算，出神了。

那晚谁也没有上门。满城都在谈论葛朗台的那一下辣手，他兄弟的破产，和侄子的到来。为了需要对共同的利益唠叨一番，索漠城内所有中上阶层的葡萄园主，都挤在台·格拉桑府上，对前任区长破口大骂。

拿侬照例绩麻，堂屋的灰色的楼板下面，除了纺车声，更没有别的声响。

“哎，哎，咱们都爱惜舌头，舍不得用哪。”她说着，露出一排又白又大的牙齿，像光杏仁。

“是呀，什么都得爱惜。”葛朗台如梦方醒似的回答。

他远远里看到三年以后的八百万家私，他在一片黄金的海上载沉载浮。

“咱们睡觉吧。我代表大家去向侄儿说一声晚安，顺便瞧瞧他要不要吃点儿东西。”

葛朗台太太站在二层楼的楼梯台上，想听听老头儿跟查理说些什么。欧也妮比母亲大胆，更走上两级。

“喂，侄儿，你心里难受是不是？好吧，你哭吧，这是常情。父亲总是父亲。可是我们遇到苦难就得耐心忍受。你在这里哭，我却在替你打算。你瞧，做伯父的对你多好。来，拿出勇气来。要不要喝一小杯酒呢？”

索漠的酒是不值钱的：请人喝酒就像印度人请喝茶。

“哎，”葛朗台接着说，“你没有点火。要不得，要不得！做什么事都得看个清楚啊。”

说着他走到壁炉架前面。

“哟！这不是白烛吗？哪儿来的白烛？娘儿们为了替这个孩子煮鸡蛋，把我楼板都会拆掉呢！”

一听到这几句，母女俩赶紧回房，钻在床上，像受惊的耗子逃回老巢一样快。

“葛朗台太太，你有金山银山不是？”丈夫走进妻子的卧房问。

“朋友，我在祷告，等一会儿好不好？”可怜的母亲声音异样地回答。

“见他的鬼，你的好天爷！”葛朗台咕噜着说。

凡是守财奴都只知道眼前，不相信来世。葛朗台这句话，把现在这个时代赤裸裸地暴露了出来。金钱控制法律，控制政治，控制风俗，到了前所未有的程度。学校，书籍，人物，主义，一切都在破坏对来世的信仰，破坏这一千八百年以来的社会基础。如今坟墓只是一个无人惧怕的阶段。死后的未来，给提到现在来了。不管什么义与不义，只要能够达到尘世的天堂，享尽繁华之福，化心肝为铁石，胼手胝足地去争取暂时的财富，像从前的殉道者为了未来的幸福而受尽苦难一样。这是今日最普遍的，到处都揭示着的思想，甚至法律上也这样写着。法律不是问立法者“你想些什么？”而是问“你出多少代价？”等到这种主义从布尔乔亚传布到平民大众的时候，真不知我们的国家要变成什么模样。

“太太，你完了没有？”老箍桶匠问。

“朋友，我还在为你祈祷呢。”

“好吧！再见。明儿早上再谈。”

可怜的女人睡下时，仿佛小学生没有念熟功课，生怕醒来看到老师生气的面孔。正当她怀着鬼胎钻入被窝，蒙住耳朵时，欧也妮穿着衬衣，光着脚，跑到床前，吻着她的前额说：

“噢！好妈妈，明天我跟他说，一切都是我做的。”

“不行，他会送你到诺阿伊哀。还是让我来对付，他不会把我吃掉的。”

“你听见没有，妈妈？”

“什么？”

“他老是在哭哪。”

“去睡觉吧，孩子。你光着脚要受凉了，地砖潮得很呢。”

这一重大的日子就这样过去了。有钱而可怜的独养女儿，一辈子都忘不了这一日；从今以后，她的睡眠再没有从前那么酣畅、那么深沉了。

人生有些行为，虽然千真万确，但从事情本身看，往往像是不可能的。大概我们对于一些自发的决心，从没加以心理的剖析，对于促成那些行为的神秘的原因，没有加以说明。欧也妮深刻的热情，也许要在她最微妙的组织中去分析；因为她的热情，如一般爱挖苦的人所说的，变成了一种病，使她终身受到影响。许多人宁可否认事情的结局，不愿估计一下把许多精神现象暗中联系起来的关系、枢纽和连锁的力量。在懂得观察人性的人，看了欧也妮的过去，就知道她会天真到毫无顾忌，会突如其来地流露感情。她过去的生活越平静，女子的怜悯，这最有机智的情感，在她心中发展得越猛烈。所以被白天的事情扰乱之下，她夜里惊醒了好几次，探听堂兄弟的声息，以为又听到了从隔天起一直在她心中响着的哀叹；忽而她看见他悲伤得闭住了气，忽而梦见他差不多要饿死了。黎明时分，她确实听到一声可怕的呼喊，便立刻穿衣，在晨光中蹑手蹑脚地赶到堂兄弟房里。房门打开着，白烛一直烧到盘底上。查理疲倦至极，在靠椅中和衣睡着，脑袋倒在床上。他像一般空肚子的人一样做着梦。欧也妮此时尽可哭个痛快，尽可仔细鉴赏这张年轻秀美的脸，脸上刻画着痛苦的痕迹，眼睛哭肿了，虽然睡着，似乎还在流泪。查理睡梦中受到精神的感应，觉得欧也妮来了，便睁开眼睛，看见她满脸同情地站在面前。

“噢，大姊，对不起。”他显然不知道什么时间，也不知道身在何处。

“弟弟，这里还有几颗真诚的心听到你的声音，我们以为你需要什么呢。你该好好地睡，这样坐着太累了。”

“是的。”

“那么再见吧。”

她赶紧溜走，觉得跑到这儿来又高兴又害臊。只有天真才会做出这种冒失的事。要是心里明白的话，连德行也会像罪恶一般做种种计较的。欧也妮在堂兄弟面前并没发抖，一回到自己屋里却两腿站不直了。浑浑噩噩的生活突然告终，她左思右想地考虑起来，把自己大大地埋怨了一番。“他对我要怎么想呢！以为我爱上了他吧。”其实这正是她最希望的。坦白的爱情自有它的预感，知道爱能生爱。幽居独处的姑娘，居然偷偷跑进一个青年的屋子，这是何等的大事！在爱情中间，有些思想，有些行为，对某些心灵不就等于神圣的婚约吗？

一小时以后，她走进母亲房内，像平时一样服侍她起床。然后她俩坐在窗下老位置上等候葛朗台，焦急的情绪正如一个人害怕责骂与惩戒的时候，心发冷发热，或者揪紧或者膨胀，看各人的气质而定。这种情绪也很自然，连家畜也感觉到：它们自己不小心而受了伤可以不哼一声，犯了过失挨了打，一点儿痛苦就会使它们号叫。老头儿下楼了，心不在焉地跟太太说话，拥抱了一下欧也妮，坐上饭桌，仿佛已经忘记了隔夜恐吓的话。

“侄儿怎么啦？这孩子倒不打搅人。”

“先生，他睡着呢。”拿侬回答。

“再好没有，他用不到白烛了。”葛朗台用讥讽的口气说。

这种反常的宽大，带些讽刺的高兴，使葛朗台太太不胜惊奇，留神瞧着她的丈夫。老头儿……（这儿似乎应当提醒读者，在都兰、安育、博爱都、布勒塔尼这些区域，老头儿这个名称——我们已经好几次用来称呼葛朗台了——用于最淳厚的人，同时也用于最残忍的人，只要他们到了相当的年龄。所以这个称呼对个人的慈悲仁厚毫无关系。）老头儿拿起帽子、手套，说：

“我要到广场上去溜达一下，好碰到咱们的几位克罗旭。”

“欧也妮，你父亲心中一定有事。”母亲对女儿说。

的确，不大需要睡眠的葛朗台，夜里大半时间都在做种种初步的盘算。这些盘算，使他的见解、观察、计划，特别来得准确，而且百发百中，做一样成功一样，叫索漠人惊叹不已。人类所有的力量，只是耐心加上时间的混合。所谓强者是既有意志，又能等待时机。守财奴的生活，便是不断地运用这种力量为自我效劳。他只依赖两种情感：自尊心与利益。但利益既是自尊心的实际表现，又是真正优越的凭据，所以自尊心与利益是一物的两面，都从自私自利来的。因此，凡是守财奴都特别耐人寻味，只要有高明的手段把他烘托出来。这种人物涉及所有的情感，可以说集情感之大成，而我们个个人都跟他们一脉相通。哪里有什么全无欲望的人？而没有金钱，哪个欲望能够满足？

葛朗台的确心中有事，照他妻子的说法。像所有的守财奴一样，他非跟人家钩心斗角，把他们的钱合法地赚过来不可，这在他是一种无时或已的需要。搜刮旁人，岂非施展自己的威力，使自己老是可以有名有分地瞧不起那些过于懦弱的、给人吃掉的人吗？躺在上帝面前的那平安恬静的羔羊，真是尘世的牺牲者最动人的写照，象征了牺牲者在彼世界的生活，证明懦弱与受苦受到何等的光荣。可是这些微言奥旨有谁懂得？守财奴只知道把这头羔羊养得肥肥的，把它关起来，宰它，烤它，吃掉它，轻蔑它。金钱与鄙薄，才是守财奴的养料。

夜里，老头儿的念头换了一个方向；这是他表示宽大的缘故。他想好了一套阴谋诡计，预备开巴黎人的玩笑，折磨他们，捉弄他们，把他们捻一阵捏一阵，叫他们奔来，奔去，流汗，希望，急得脸色发白；是啊，他这个老箍桶匠，在灰色的堂屋里，在索漠家中虫蛀的楼梯上走的时候，就能这样地玩弄巴黎人。他一心想着侄儿的事，他要挽回亡弟的名誉，可无须他或他的侄儿花一个钱。他的现金马上要存放出去，三年为期，现在他只消管理田地了；所以非得找些材料让他施展一下狡狯的本领不可，而兄弟的破产就是现成的问题。手里没有旁的东西可以挤压，他就想把巴黎人捏成齑粉让查理得些实惠，自己又一文不花地做了个有义气的哥哥。他的计划中根本没有什么家庭的名誉，他的好意有如赌徒的心情，喜欢看一场自己没有下注的赌博赌得精彩。克罗旭是他必不可少的帮手，他却不愿意去找他们，而要他们来找他。他决心把刚才想好的计划当晚就开始搬演，以便下一天早上，不用花一个小钱，叫全城的人喝他的彩。

吝啬鬼许的愿·情人起的誓


父亲不在家，欧也妮就不胜欣喜地可以公然关切她心爱的堂兄弟，可以放心大胆把胸中蕴蓄着的怜悯，对他尽量发泄了。怜悯是女子胜过男子的德行之一，是她愿意让人家感觉到的唯一的情感，是她肯让男人挑逗起来而不怨怪的唯一的情感。欧也妮跑去听堂兄弟的呼吸，听了三四次，要知道他睡着还是醒了；之后，他起床了，于是咖啡、乳酪、鸡蛋、水果、盘子、杯子，一切有关早餐的东西，都成为她费心照顾的对象。她轻快地爬上破旧的楼梯，听堂兄弟的响动。他是不是在穿衣呀？他还在哭吗？她一直跑到房门外面。

“喂，弟弟！”

“哎，大姊！”

“你喜欢在哪儿用早餐，堂屋里还是你房里？”

“随便。”

“你好吗？”

“大姊，说来惭愧，我肚子饿了。”

这段隔着房门的谈话，在欧也妮简直是小说之中大段的穿插。

“那么我们把早餐端到你房里来吧，免得父亲不高兴。”

她身轻如燕地跑下厨房。

“拿侬，去替他收拾卧房。”

这座上上下下不知跑了多少次的楼梯，一点儿声音就会咯咯作响的，在欧也妮眼中忽然变得不破旧了；她觉得楼梯明晃晃的，会说话，像她自己一样年轻，像她的爱情一样年轻，同时又为她的爱情服务。还有她母亲，慈祥而宽容的母亲，也乐意受她爱情的幻想驱遣。查理的卧房收拾好了，她俩一齐进去，替不幸的孩子做伴：基督教的慈悲，不是叫人安慰受难者吗？两个女子在宗教中寻出许多似是而非的怪论，为她们有失体统的行为做借口。

因此查理·葛朗台受到最亲切最温柔的款待。他为了痛苦而破碎的心，清清楚楚地感到这种体贴入微的友谊，这种美妙的同情的甜蜜；那是母女俩被压迫的心灵，在痛苦的领域——它们的日常天地——内心能有一刻儿自由就会流露的。既然是至亲骨肉，欧也妮就不妨把堂兄弟的内衣和随身带来的梳妆用具整理一下，顺便把手头捡到的小玩意儿，镂金镂银的东西，称心如意地逐件玩赏，并且以察看做工为名，拿在手里不放。查理看到伯母与堂姊对他古道热肠的关切，不由得大为感动；他对巴黎社会有相当的认识，知道以他现在的处境，照例只能受人冷淡。他发觉欧也妮那种特殊的美，光艳照人；隔夜他认为可笑的生活习惯，从此他赞美她的纯朴了。所以当欧也妮从拿侬手中接过一只珐琅的碗，满满盛着咖啡和乳酪，很亲热地端给堂兄弟，不胜怜爱地望了他一眼时，查理便含着泪拿起她的手亲吻。

“哎哟，你又怎么啦？”她问。

“哦！我感激得流泪了。”

欧也妮突然转身跑向壁炉架拿烛台。

“拿侬，”她说，“来，把烛台拿走。”

她回头再瞧堂兄弟的时候，脸上还有一片红晕，但眼神已经镇定，不致把衷心洋溢的快乐泄露了；可是两人的目光都表现同样的情绪，正如他们的心灵交融在同一的思想中：未来是属于他们的了。

这番柔情，查理觉得特别甘美，因为他遭了大难，早已不敢存什么希望。大门上锤子响了一下，立刻把两个女子召归原位。幸而她们下楼相当快，在葛朗台进来的时候，手里已经拿上活计；如果他在楼下环洞那边碰到她们是准会疑心的。老头儿急急忙忙吃完午餐之后，来了法劳丰田上看庄子的，早先说好的津贴至今没拿到。他带来一只野兔、几只鹧鸪，都是大花园里打到的，还有磨坊司务欠下的鳗鱼与两条梭鱼。

“哎！哎！来得正好，这高诺阿莱。这东西好吃吗，你说？”

“好吃得很呢，好心的先生；打下来有两天了。”

“喂，拿侬，快来！”好家伙说，“把这些东西拿去，做晚饭菜；我要请两位克罗旭吃饭呢。”

拿侬瞪着眼发呆，对大家望着。

“可是，”她说，“叫我哪儿来肥肉跟香料呢？”

“太太，”葛朗台说，“给拿侬六法郎。等会儿我要到地窖里去找好酒，别忘了提醒我一声。”

看庄子的久已预备好一套话，想解决工资问题：

“这么说来，葛朗台先生……”

“咄，咄，咄，咄！”葛朗台答道，“我知道你的意思，你是一个好小子。今天我忙得很，咱们明儿谈吧。太太，先给他五法郎。”

他说完赶紧跑了。可怜的女人觉得花上十一法郎求一个清静，高兴得很。她知道葛朗台把给她的钱一个一个逼回去之后，准有半个月不寻事。

“哎，高诺阿莱，”她把十法郎塞在他手里说，“回头我们再重重谢你吧。”

高诺阿莱没有话说，走了。拿侬戴上黑头巾，抓起篮子说：

“太太，我只要三法郎就够了，多下的你留着吧。行了，我照样会对付的。”

“拿侬，饭菜弄好一些呀，堂兄弟下来吃饭的呢。”欧也妮吩咐。

“真是，家里有了大事了，”葛朗台太太说，“我结婚到现在，这是你父亲第三次请客。”

四点左右，欧也妮和母亲摆好了六个人的刀叉，屋主把内地人那么珍视的旧藏佳酿，提了几瓶出来，查理也进了堂屋。他脸色苍白，举动，态度，目光，说话的音调，在悲苦中别有一番妩媚。他并没假装悲伤，他的难受是真实的，痛苦罩在他脸上的阴影，有一副为女子特别喜爱的神情。欧也妮因之愈加爱他了。或许苦难替欧也妮把他拉近了些。查理不再是那个高不可攀的、有钱的美少年，而是一个遭难的穷亲戚。苦难生平等。救苦救难是女子与天使相同的地方。查理和欧也妮彼此用眼睛说话，靠眼睛了解；那个落难公子，可怜的孤儿，躲在一边不出一声，沉着，高傲；但堂姊温柔慈爱的目光不时落在他身上，逼他抛开愁苦的念头，跟她一起神游于未来与希望之中，那是她最乐意的事。

葛朗台请克罗旭吃饭的消息，这时轰动了全城；他前一天出售当年的收成，对全体种葡萄的背信的罪行，倒没有把人心刺激得这么厉害。苏格拉底的弟子阿契皮阿特，为了惊世骇俗，曾经把自己的狗割掉尾巴；如果这老奸巨猾的葡萄园主以同样的心思请客，或许他也可成为一个大人物；可是他老是玩弄城里的人，没有遇到过一个对手，所以从不把索漠人放在心上。台·格拉桑他们，知道了查理的父亲暴卒与可能破产的新闻，决意当天晚上就到他们的主雇家吊唁一番，慰问一番，同时探听一下他们为什么事，在这种情形之下请几位克罗旭吃饭。

五点整，特·篷风所长跟他的叔叔老克罗旭公证人，浑身上下穿得齐齐整整地来了。大家立刻入席，开始大嚼。葛朗台严肃，查理静默，欧也妮一声不出，葛朗台太太不比平时多开口，真是一顿款待吊客的丧家饭。

大家离席的时候，查理对伯父伯母说：

“对不起，我先告退了，有些极不愉快的长信要写。”

“请吧请吧，侄儿。”

他一走，葛朗台认为查理一心一意地去写信，什么都听不见的了，便狡狯地望着妻子说：

“太太，我们要谈的话，对你们简直是天书，此刻七点半，还是钻进你们的被窝去吧。明儿见，欧也妮。”

他拥抱了女儿，两位女子离开了堂屋。葛朗台与人交接的结果，早已磨炼得诡计多端，使一般被他咬得太凶的人常常暗里叫他老狗。那天晚上，他比平生任何时候都运用更多的机巧。倘使索漠前任区长的野心放得远大一些，再加机缘凑巧，爬上高位，奉派到国际会议中去，把他保护私人利益的长才在那里表现一番的话，毫无疑问他会替法国立下大功。但也说不定一离开索漠，老头儿只是一个毫无出息的可怜虫。有些人的头脑，或许像有些动物一般，从本土移到了另一个地方，离开了当地的水土，就没法繁殖。

“所……所长……先……先……先生，你你你……说……说说说过破破破产……”

他假装了多少年而大家久已当真的口吃，和他在雨天常常抱怨的耳聋，在这个场合使两位克罗旭难受死了，他们一边听一边不知不觉地扯动嘴脸，仿佛要把他故意卷在舌尖上的字眼代为补足。在此我们应当追叙一下葛朗台的口吃与耳聋的故事。

在安育地区，对当地的土话懂得那么透彻，讲得那么清楚的，谁都比不上这狡狯的葡萄园主。但他虽是精明透顶，从前却上过一个犹太人的当。在谈判的时候，那犹太人老把两手捧着耳朵，假装听不清，同时结结巴巴的，口吃得厉害，永远说不出适当的字眼，以致葛朗台竟吃了善心的亏，自动替狡猾的犹太人寻找他心中的思想与字眼，结果把犹太人的理由代说了，他说的话倒像是该死的犹太人应该说的，他终于变了犹太人而不是葛朗台了。那场古怪的辩论所做成的交易，是老箍桶匠平生唯一吃亏的买卖。但他虽然经济上受了损失，精神上却得了一次很好的教训，从此得益匪浅。葛朗台临了还祝福那个犹太人，因为他学会了一套本领，在生意上叫敌人不耐烦，逼对方老是替我这方面打主意，而忘掉他自身的观点。

那天晚上所要解决的问题，的确最需要耳聋与口吃，最需要莫名其妙地兜圈子，把自己的思想深藏起来：第一他不愿对自己的计划负责；第二他不愿授人话柄，要人家猜不透他的真主意。

“特·篷……篷……篷风先生。”

葛朗台称克罗旭公证人的侄子为篷风先生，三年以来这是第二次。所长听了很可能当作那奸刁的老头儿已经选定他做女婿。

“你你你……真的说……说破破破产，在……在某某……某些情形中可……可可以……由……由……”

“可以由商事裁判出面阻止。这是常有的事。”特·篷风先生这么说，自以为把葛朗台老头的思想抓住了，或者猜到了，预备诚诚恳恳替他解释一番，便又道，“你听我说。”

“我听……听……听着。”老头儿不胜惶恐地回答，狡猾的神气，像一小学生面上装作静听老师的话，暗地里却在讪笑。

“一个受人尊敬而重要的人物，譬如像你已故的令弟……”

“舍弟……是的。”

“有周转不灵的危险……”

“那……那那叫……叫作……周周周转不灵吗？”

“是的。……以致免不了破产的时候，有管辖权的（请你注意）商事裁判所，可以凭它的判决，委任几个当事人所属的商会中人做清理委员。清理并非破产，懂不懂？一个破产的人名誉扫地，但宣告清理的人是清白的。”

“那相相差……太大了，要是……那……那并并并不……花……花……花更……更……更多的钱。”葛朗台说。

“可是即使没有商事裁判所帮忙，仍旧可以宣告清理的，因为，”所长吸了一撮鼻烟，接着说，“你知道宣告破产要经过怎样的手续吗？”

“是呀，我从来没有想……想……想过。”葛朗台回答。

“第一，”法官往下说，“当事人或者他的合法登记的代理人，要亲自造好一份资产负债表，送往法院书记室。第二，由债权人出面申请。可是如果当事人不提出资产负债表，或者债权人不申请法院把当事人宣告破产，那么怎么办呢？”

“对……对对对啦，怎……怎……怎么办呢？”

“那么死者亲族，代表人，承继人，或者当事人自己，如果他没有死，或者他的朋友，如果他避不见面，可以办清理。也许你想把令弟的债务宣告清理吧？”所长问。

“啊！葛朗台！”公证人嚷道，“那可好极了。我们偏僻的内地还知道名誉的可贵。要是你保得身家清白，因为这的确与你的身家有关，那你真是大丈夫了……”

“伟大极了！”所长插嘴道。

“当……当然，”老头儿答道，“我兄兄兄弟姓……姓……姓葛朗台，跟……跟我我……我……我一样，还……还……还还用说吗？我……我……我……我没有说不。清清……清……清……清理，在在……无……无论何……何种情……情形之下，从从……各各……各……各方面看看看，对我侄……侄……侄儿是很……很……很有有有利的，侄……侄侄儿又又又是我……我喜……喜欢的。可是先……先要弄清楚。我不认……认……认得那些巴黎的坏蛋。我……我是在索……索漠，对不对？我的葡葡葡萄秧，沟沟渠，总总……总之，我有我的事事事情。我从没出过约……约……约期票。什么叫作约期票？我收收收……收到过很……很多，从来没有……出……出给人家。我只……只……只知道约期票可……可可可以兑现，可……可可以贴贴贴现。听……听说约……约……约期票可可以赎赎赎回……”

“是的，”所长说，“约期票可以打一个折扣从市场上收回来。你懂吗？”

葛朗台两手捧着耳朵，所长把话再说了一遍。

“那么，”老头儿答道，“这些事情也……也有好有坏喽？我……我……我老了，这这这些都……都弄弄……弄不清。我得留……留在这儿看……看……看守谷子。谷子快……快收了，咱们靠……靠……靠谷子开……开开销。最要紧的是，看……看好收成，在法劳丰我我……我有重……重要的收入。我不能放……放……放弃了家去去对对……对付那鬼……鬼……鬼……鬼事，我又搅搅不清。你你说……要避免破产，要办办……办清……清……清理，我得去巴黎。一个人又不不……不是一只鸟，怎怎……怎么能同时在……在……在两个地方……”

“我明白你的意思，”公证人嚷道，“可是老朋友，你有的是朋友，有的是肯替你尽心出力的朋友。”

“得啦，”老头儿心里想，“那么你自己提议呀！”

“倘使派一个人到巴黎去，找到令弟琪奥默最大的债主，对他说……”

“且慢，”老头儿插嘴道，“对他说……说什么？是……是不是这……这样：‘索漠的葛朗台长……索漠……的葛朗台短，他爱他的兄弟，爱他的侄……侄……侄子。葛朗台是一个好哥……哥哥，有一番很好的意思。他的收……收……收成卖了好价。你们不要宣告破……破……破……破产，你们集集集合起来，委……委……委托几个清……清……清理人。那那时葛朗台再……再……再瞧着办。与其让法院里的人沾……沾……沾手，不如清理来……来……来得上算……’嗯，是不是这么说？”

“对！”所长回答。

“因为，你瞧，篷……篷……篷……篷风先生，我们要三……三思而行。做……做不到总……总是做……做不到。凡是花……花……花钱的事，先得把收支搞清楚，才才才不至于倾……倾……倾家荡产。嗯，对不对？”

“当然喽，”所长说，“我嘛，我认为花几个月的时间，出一笔钱，以协议的方式付款，可以把债券全部赎回。啊啊！你手里拿块肥肉，那些狗还不跟你跑吗？只要不宣告破产，把债权证件抓在你手里，你就是白璧无瑕。”

“白……白……白璧？”葛朗台又把两手捧着耳朵，“我不懂什么白……白……白璧。”

“哎，”所长嚷道，“你听我说呀。”

“我……我我听着。”

“债券是一种商品，也有市价涨落。这是根据英国法学家虞莱弥·朋撒姆关于高利贷的理论推演出来的。他曾经证明，大家谴责高利贷的成见是荒谬的。”

“嗯！”好家伙哼了一声。

“据朋撒姆的看法，既然原则上金钱是一种商品，代表金钱的东西也是一种商品，既然是商品，就免不了市价涨落；那么契据这种商品，有某某人签字的文件，也像旁的货物一样，市场会忽而多忽而少，它们的价值也就忽而高忽而低，法院可以要人家……（哦，我多糊涂，对不起……）我认为你可以把令弟的债券打个二五折赎回来。”

“他叫……叫……叫作虞……虞……虞莱弥·朋……”

“朋撒姆，是个英国人。”

“这个虞莱弥，使我们在生意上再也用不到怨气冲天。”公证人笑着说。

“这些英国人有……有……有时真讲情……情理，”葛朗台说，“那么，照朋……朋……朋撒姆的看法，要是我兄弟的债券值……值……值多少……实际是并不值！我我……我……我说得对不对？我觉得明白得很……债主可能……不，不可能……我懂……懂懂得。”

“认我解释给你听吧，”所长说，“在法律上要是你拿到葛朗台号子所有欠人的债券，令弟和他的继承人就算跟大家两讫了，行了。”

“行了。”老头儿也跟着说了一遍。

“以公道而论，要是令弟的债券，在市场上谈判好，（谈判，你明白这两个字的意思吗？）谈判好打多少折扣；要是你朋友中有人在场收买了下来，既然债权人自愿出售而并没受暴力胁迫，那么令弟的遗产就光明正大地没有什么负债了。”

“不错……生……生……生意是生意，这是老话，”箍桶匠说，“可是，你明……明……明……明白，这很……很……很难。我……我……我没有钱钱钱，也……也……也没有空，没有空也没……”

“是的，你不能分身。那么我代你上巴黎。（旅费归你，那是小意思。）我去找那些债权人，跟他们谈，把债券收回，把付款的期限展缓，只要在清算的总数上多付一笔钱，一切都好商量的。”

“咱咱咱们再谈，我不……不……不……能，我不愿随……随……随便答应，在在在……没……没有……做……做不到，总是做……做不到。你你你明白？”

“那不错。”

“你跟……跟……跟我讲……讲……讲的这一套，把我……我……我头都涨……涨……涨昏了。我活到现在，第……第……第一次要想……想到这这……”

“对，你不是法学家。”

“不过是一个可……可……可怜的种葡萄的，你……你……你刚才说的，我一点儿不知道；我……我……我得研……研……研究一一一下。”

“那么……”所长似乎想把他们的谈话归纳出一个结论来。公证人带着埋怨的口吻插嘴道：

“老侄！……”

“哦，叔叔？”

“你应当让葛朗台先生说明他的意思。委托这样一件事不是小事。咱们的朋友应当把范围说清……”

大门上一声锤响，报告台·格拉桑一家来了，他们的进场和寒暄，打断了克罗旭的话。这一打岔，公证人觉得很高兴，葛朗台已经在冷眼觑他，肉瘤颤巍巍地表示心中的激动。可是首先，小心谨慎的公证人认为一个初级裁判所所长根本不宜于上巴黎去钓债权人上钩，牵入与法律抵触而不清不白的阴谋中去；其次，葛朗台老头肯不肯出钱还一点儿没有表示，侄儿就冒冒失地参与，也使公证人莫名其妙地觉得害怕。所以他趁台·格拉桑他们进来的当儿，抓着所长的胳膊，把他拉到一个窗洞下面：

“老侄，你的意思表示得够了，献殷勤也应当适可而止。你想他的女儿想昏了。不要见鬼，没头没脑地乱冲乱撞。现在让我来把舵，你只要从旁边助我一臂就行。难道你值得以堂堂法官之尊，去参与这样一件……”

他没有说完，听见台·格拉桑向老箍桶匠伸着手说：

“葛朗台，我们知道府上遭了不幸，琪奥默·葛朗台的号子出了事，令弟去世了，我们特地来表示哀悼。”

公证人插嘴道：

“最不幸的是二爷的死。要是他想到向兄长求救，就不至于自杀了。咱们的老朋友爱名誉，连指甲缝里都爱到家，他想出面清理巴黎葛朗台的债务呢。舍侄为免得葛朗台在这桩涉及司法的交涉中遇到麻烦，提议立刻代他去巴黎跟债权人磋商，使他们相当地满足。”

这段话，加上葡萄园主摸着下巴的态度，叫三位台·格拉桑诧异到万分。他们一路来的时候还在称心如意地骂葛朗台守财奴，差不多认为兄弟就是给他害死的。这时银行家却望着他的太太嚷道：

“啊！我早知道的！喂，太太，我路上跟你怎么说的？葛朗台连头发根里都是爱惜名誉的，绝不肯让他们的姓氏有一点儿玷污。有钱而没有名誉是一种病。咱们内地还有人爱名誉呢！葛朗台，你这个态度好极了，好极了。我是一个老军人，装不了假，只晓得把心里的话直说。这真是，我的天！伟大极了。”说着银行家热烈地握着他的手。

“可可可是伟……伟……伟大要花大……大……大钱呀。”老头儿回答。

“但是，亲爱的葛朗台，”台·格拉桑接着说，“请所长先生不要生气，这纯粹是件生意上的事，要一个生意上的老手去交涉的。什么回复权，预支，利息的计算，全得内行。我有些事上巴黎，可以附带代你……”

“咱们慢慢地来考虑，怎怎……怎么样想出一个可……可……可能的办法，使我不……不……不至于贸贸然答……答……答应我……我……我不愿愿愿意做的事，”葛朗台结结巴巴地回答，“因为，你瞧，所长先生当然要我负担旅费的。”说这最后几句时他不口吃了。台·格拉桑太太便说：

“哎！到巴黎去是一种享受，我愿意自己花旅费去呢。”

她对丈夫丢了一个眼色，似乎鼓励他不惜代价把这件差事从敌人手里抢过来；她又带着嘲弄的神气望望两位脸色沮丧的克罗旭。

于是葛朗台抓住了银行家的衣纽，拉他到一边对他说：

“在你跟所长中间，我自然更信任你。而且，”他的肉瘤牵动了几下，“其中还有文章呢。我想买公债，大概有好几万法郎的数目，可是只预备出八十法郎的价钱。据说月底行市会跌。你是内行，是不是？”

“嘿！岂敢！这样说来，我得替你收进几万法郎的公债啰？”

“嘘！开场小做做。我玩这个，谁都不让知道。你可以买月底的期货；可是不能叫克罗旭他们得知，他们会不高兴。既然你上巴黎去，你替我可怜的侄儿探探风色。”

“就这样吧，”台·格拉桑提高了嗓音，“明天我搭驿车动身，几点钟再来请示细节呢？”

“明天五点吧，吃晚饭以前。”葡萄园主搓着手。

两家客人又一起坐了一会儿。台·格拉桑趁谈话停顿的当儿拍拍葛朗台的肩膀说：

“有这样的同胞兄弟，叫人看了也痛快……”

“是呀是呀，”葛朗台回答说，“表面上看不出，我可是极重骨……骨肉之情。我对兄弟很好，可以向大家证明，要是花……花……花钱不……不多……”银行家不等他说完，很识趣地插嘴道：

“咱们告辞了，葛朗台。我要提早动身的话，还得把事情料理料理。”

“好，好，为了刚才和你谈的那件事，我……我要进……进……进我的‘评评……评……评议室’去，像克罗旭所长说的。”

“该死！一下子我又不是特·篷风先生了。”法官郁郁不乐地想，脸上的表情好像在庭上给辩护律师弄得不耐烦似的。

两家敌对的人物一齐走了。早上葛朗台出卖当地葡萄园主的行为，都给忘掉了，彼此只想刺探对方：对于好家伙在这件新发生的事情上存什么心，是怎么一个看法。可是谁也不肯表示。

“你跟我们上特·奥松华太太家去吗？”台·格拉桑问公证人。

“咱们过一会儿去，”所长回答，“要是家叔允许的话，我答应特·格里鲍果小姐到她那边转一转的，我们要先上那儿。”

“那么再见啰，诸位。”台·格拉桑太太说。

他们别过了两位克罗旭，才走了几步，阿道夫便对他的父亲说：

“他们这一下可冒火呢，嗯？”

“别胡说，孩子，”他母亲回答道，“他们还听得见。而且你的话不登大雅，完全是法科学生的味儿。”

法官眼看台·格拉桑一家走远之后，嚷道：

“喂，叔叔！开场我是特·篷风所长，结果仍旧是光杆儿的克罗旭。”

“我知道你会生气，不过风向的确对台·格拉桑有利。你聪明人怎么糊涂起来了！葛朗台老头‘咱们再谈’那一套，由他们去相信吧。孩子，你放心，欧也妮还不一样是你的？”

不多一会儿，葛朗台慷慨的决心同时在三份人家传布开去，城里的人只谈着这桩手足情深的义举。葛朗台破坏了葡萄园主的誓约而出卖存酒的事，大家都加以原谅，一致佩服他的诚实，赞美他的义气，那是出于众人意料之外的。法国人的性格，就是喜欢捧一时的红角儿，为新鲜事儿上劲。那些群众竟是健忘得厉害。

葛朗台一关上大门，就叫唤拿侬：

“你别把狗放出来，等会儿睡觉，咱们还得一起干事呢。十一点钟的时候，高诺阿莱会赶着法劳丰的破车到这儿来。你留心听着，别让他敲门，叫他轻轻地进来。警察局不许人家黑夜里高声大气地闹。再说，乡邻也用不到知道我出门。”

说完之后，葛朗台走进他的工作室，拿侬听着他走动，找东西，来来去去，可是小心得很。显而易见他不愿惊醒太太和女儿，尤其不愿惹起侄儿的注意。他瞧见侄儿屋内还有灯光，已经在私下咒骂了。

半夜里，一心想着堂兄弟的欧也妮，似乎听见一个快要死去的人在那里呻吟，而这个快要死去的人，对她便是查理：他和她分手的时候脸色不是那么难看，那么垂头丧气吗？也许他自杀呢！她突然之间披了一件有风兜的大氅想走出去。先是她房门的隙缝中透进一道强烈的光，把她吓了一跳，以为是失了火；后来她放心了，因为听见拿侬沉重的脚步与说话的声音，还夹着好几匹马嘶叫的声音。她极其小心地把门打开一点儿，免得发出声响，但开到正好瞧见甬道里的情形。她心里想：“难道父亲把堂兄弟架走了不成？”

冷不防她的眼睛跟父亲的眼睛碰上了，虽然不是瞧着她，而且也毫不疑心她在门后偷看，欧也妮却吓坏了。老头儿和拿侬两个，右肩上架着一根又粗又短的棍子，棍子上系了一条绳索，扣着一只木桶，正是葛朗台闲着没事的辰光在面包房里做着玩的那种。

“圣母玛利亚！好重噢！先生。”拿侬轻声地说。

“可惜只是一些大铜钱！”老头儿回答，“当心碰到烛台。”

楼梯扶手的两根柱子中间，只照着一根蜡烛。

“高诺阿莱，”葛朗台对那个虚有其名的看庄子的说，“你带了手枪没有？”

“没有，先生。嘿！你那些大钱怕什么？……”

“噢！不怕。”葛朗台回答。

“再说，我们走得很快，”看庄子的又道，“你的佃户替你预备了最好的马。”

“行，行。你没有跟他们说我上哪儿去吗？”

“我压根儿不知道。”

“好吧。车子结实吗？”

“结实？嘿，能装三千斤。你那些破酒桶有多重？”

“哦，那我知道！”拿侬说，“总该有一千八百斤。”

“别多嘴，拿侬！跟太太说我下乡去了，回来吃夜饭。——高诺阿莱，快一点儿，九点以前要赶到安越。”

车子走了。拿侬锁上大门，放了狗，肩头酸痛地睡下，街坊上没有一个人知道葛朗台出门，更没有人知道他出门的目的。老头儿真是机密透顶。在这座堆满黄金的屋子里，谁也没有见过一个大钱。早晨他在码头上听见人家闲话，说南德城里接了大批装配船只的生意，金价涨了一倍，投机商都到安越来收买黄金，他听了便向佃户借了几匹马，预备把家里的藏金装到安越去抛售，拿回一笔库券，作为买公债的款子，而且趁金价暴涨的机会又好赚一笔外快。

“父亲走了。”欧也妮心里想，她在楼梯高头把一切都听清楚了。

屋子里又变得寂静无声，逐渐远去的车轮声，在万家酣睡的索漠城中已经听不见了。这时欧也妮在没有用耳朵谛听之前，先在心中听到一声呻吟从查理房中传来，一直透过她卧房的板壁。三楼门缝里漏出一道像刀口一般细的光，横照在破楼梯的栏杆上。她爬上两级，心里想：

“他不好过哩。”

第二次的呻吟使她爬到了楼梯高头，把虚掩着的房门推开了。查理睡着，脑袋倒在旧靠椅外面；笔已经掉下，手几乎碰到了地。他在这种姿势中呼吸困难的模样，叫欧也妮突然害怕起来，赶紧走进卧房。

“他一定累死了。”她看到十几封封好的信，心里想。她看见信封上写着——法莱—勃莱曼车行——蒲伊松成衣铺，等等。

“他一定在料理事情，好早点儿出国。”

她又看到两封打开的信，开头写着“我亲爱的阿纳德……”几个字，使她不由得一阵眼花，心儿直跳，双脚钉在地上不能动了。

“他亲爱的阿纳德！他有爱人了，有人爱他了！没有希望喽！……他对她说些什么呢？”

这些念头在她脑子里心坎里闪过，到处都看到这几个像火焰一般的字，连地砖上都有。

“没有希望了！我不能看这封信。应当走开……可是看了又怎么呢？”

她望着查理，轻轻地把他脑袋安放在椅背上，他像孩子一般听人摆布，仿佛睡熟的时候也认得自己的母亲，让她照料，受她亲吻。欧也妮也像做母亲的一样，把他垂下的手拿起，轻轻地吻了吻他的头发。“亲爱的阿纳德！”仿佛有一个鬼在她耳畔叫着这几个字。她想：

“我知道也许是不应该的，可是那封信，我还是要看。”

欧也妮转过头去，良心在责备她。善恶第一次在她心中照了面。至此为止，她从没做过使自己脸红的事。现在可是热情与好奇心把她战胜了。每读一句，她的心就膨胀一点儿，看信时身心兴奋的情绪，把她初恋的快感刺激得愈加尖锐了：

亲爱的阿纳德，什么都不能使我们分离，除了我这次遭到的大难，那是尽管谨慎小心也是预料不到的。我的父亲自杀了，我和他的财产全部丢了。由于我所受的教育，在这个年纪上我还是一个孩子，可是已经成了孤儿：虽然如此，我得像成人一样从深渊中爬起来。刚才我花了半夜工夫做了一番盘算。要是我愿意清清白白地离开法国——我一定得办到这一点——我还没有一百法郎的钱好拿了上印度或美洲去碰运气。是的，可怜的阿娜，我要到气候最恶劣的地方去找发财的机会。据说在那些地方，发财又快又稳。留在巴黎嘛，根本不可能。一个倾家荡产的人，一个破产的人的儿子，天哪，亏空了两百万！……一个这样的人所能受到的羞辱，冷淡，鄙薄，我的心和我的脸都受不了的。不到一星期，我就会在决斗中送命。所以我绝不回巴黎。你的爱，一个男人从没受到过的最温柔最忠诚的爱，也不能摇动我不去巴黎的决心。可怜啊！我最亲爱的，我没有旅费上你那儿，来给你一个，受你一个最后的亲吻，一个使我有勇气奔赴前程的亲吻……

——可怜的查理，幸亏我看了这封信！我有金子，可以给他啊，欧也妮想。她抹了抹眼泪又念下去：

我从没想到过贫穷的苦难。要是我有了必不可少的一百路易旅费，就没有一个铜子买那些起码货去做生意。不要说一百路易，连一个路易也没有。要等我把巴黎的私债清偿之后，才能知道我还剩多少钱。倘使一文不剩，我也就心平气和地上南德，到船上当水手，一到那里，我学那些苦干的人的榜样，年轻时身无分文地上印度，变了巨富回来。从今儿早上起，我把前途冷静地想过了。那对我比对旁人更加可怕，因为我受过母亲的娇养，受过最慈祥的父亲的疼爱，刚踏进社会又遇到了阿娜的爱！我一向只看见人生的鲜花，而这种福气是不会长久的。可是亲爱的阿纳德，我还有足够的勇气，虽然我一向是个无愁无虑的青年，受惯一个巴黎最迷人的女子的爱抚，享尽家庭之乐，有一个百依百顺的父亲……哦！阿纳德，我的父亲，他死了啊……

是的，我把我的处境想过了，也把你的想过了。二十四小时以来，我老了许多。亲爱的阿娜，即使为了把我留在巴黎，留在你身旁，而你牺牲一切豪华的享受，牺牲你的衣着，牺牲你在歌剧院的包厢，咱们也没法张罗一笔最低的费用，来维持我挥霍惯的生活。而且我不能接受你那么多的牺牲。因此咱们今天只能诀别。

——他离开她了，圣母玛利亚！哦，好运气！

欧也妮快乐得跳起来。查理身子动了一下，把她吓得浑身发冷；幸而他并没有醒。她又往下念：

我什么时候回来？不知道。印度的气候很容易使一个欧洲人衰老，尤其是一个辛苦的欧洲人。就说是十年吧。十年以后，你的女儿十八岁，已经是你的伴侣，会刺探你的秘密了。对你，社会已经够残酷，而你的女儿也许对你更残酷。社会的批判，少女的忘恩负义，那些榜样我们已看得不少，应当知所警惕。希望你像我一样，心坎里牢牢记着这四年幸福的回忆，别负了你可怜的朋友，如果可能的话。可是我不敢坚决要求，因为亲爱的阿纳德，我必须适应我的处境，用平凡的眼光看人生，一切都得打最实际的算盘。所以我要想到结婚，在我以后的生涯中那是一项应有的节目。而且我可以告诉你，在这里，在我索漠的伯父家里，我遇到一个堂姊，她的举动，面貌，头脑，心地，都会使你喜欢的，并且我觉得她……

欧也妮看到信在这里中断，便想：“他一定是疲倦极了，才没有写完。”

她替他找辩护的理由！当然，这封信的冷淡无情，叫这个无邪的姑娘怎么猜得透？在虔诚的气氛中长大的少女，天真，纯洁，一朝踏入了迷人的爱情世界，便觉得一切都是爱情了。她们徜徉于天国的光明中，而这光明是她们的心灵放射的，光辉所布，又照耀到她们的爱人。她们把胸中如火如荼的热情点染爱人，把自己崇高的思想当作他们的。女人的错误，差不多老是因为相信善，或是相信真。“我亲爱的阿纳德，我最亲爱的”这些字眼，传到欧也妮心中竟是爱情的最美的语言，把她听得飘飘然，好像童年听到大风琴上再三奏着“来啊，咱们来崇拜上帝”这几个庄严的音符，觉得万分悦耳一样。并且查理眼中还噙着泪水，更显出他的心地高尚，而心地高尚是最容易使少女着迷的。

她又怎么知道查理这样地爱父亲，这样真诚地哭他，并非出于什么了不得的至情至性，而是因为做父亲的实在太好的缘故。在巴黎，一般做儿女的，对父母多少全有些可怕的打算，或者看到了巴黎生活的繁华，有些欲望、有些计划老是因父母在堂而无法实现，觉得苦闷。琪奥默·葛朗台夫妇却对儿子永远百依百顺，让他穷奢极侈地享尽富贵，所以查理才不至于对父母想到那些可怕的念头。父亲不惜为了儿子挥金如土，终于在儿子心中培养起一点纯粹的孝心。然而查理究竟是一个巴黎青年，当地的风气与阿纳德的陶冶，把他训练得对什么都得计算一下；表面上年轻，他实际已经是一个深谙世故的老人。他受到巴黎社会的可怕的教育，眼见一个夜晚在思想上说话上所犯的罪，可能比重罪法庭所惩罚的还要多；信口雌黄，把最伟大的思想诋毁无余，而美其名曰妙语高论；风气所播，竟以目光准确为强者之道；所谓目光准确，乃是全无信念，既不信情感，也不信人物，也不信事实，而假造事实。在这个社会里，要目光准确就得每天早上把朋友的钱袋掂过斤两，对任何事情都得像政客一般不动感情；眼前对什么都不能钦佩赞美，既不可赞美艺术品，也不可赞美高尚的行为；对什么事都应当把个人的利益看作高于一切。那位贵族太太，美丽的阿纳德，在疯疯癫癫调情卖俏之后，教查理一本正经地思索了：她用香喷喷的手摸着他的头发，跟他讨论他的前程；一边替他重做发卷，一边教他为人生打算。她把他变得女性化而又实际化。那是从两方面使他腐化，可是使他腐化的手段，做得高雅巧妙，不同凡俗。

“查理，你真傻，”她对他说，“叫你懂得人生，真不容易。你对台·吕博先生的态度很不好。我知道他是一个不大高尚的人；可是等他失势之后你再称心如意地鄙薄他呀。你知道刚榜太太的教训吗？——孩子们，只要一个人在台上，就得尽量崇拜他；一朝下了台，赶快把他拖上垃圾堆。有权有势的时候，他等于上帝；给人家挤倒了，还不如石像被塞在阴沟里的马拉[1]，因为马拉已经死了，而他还活着。人生是一连串纵横捭阖的把戏，要研究，要时时刻刻地注意，一个人才能维持他优越的地位。”

以查理那样的一个时髦人物，父母太溺爱他，社会太奉承他，根本谈不到有何伟大的情感。母亲种在他心里的一点点真金似的品性，散到巴黎这架螺旋机中去了；这点儿品性，他平时就应用得很浅薄，而且多次摩擦之后，迟早要磨蚀完的。但那时查理只有二十一岁。在这个年纪上，生命的朝气似乎跟心灵的坦白还分不开。声音，目光，面貌，都显得与情感调和。所以当一个人眼神清澈如水，额上还没有一道皱纹的时候，纵使最无情的法官，最不轻信人的讼师，最难相与的债主，也不敢贸然断定他的心已老于世故，工于算计。巴黎哲学的教训，查理从没机会实地应用过，至此为止，他的美是美在没有经验。可是不知不觉之间，他血里已经种下了自私自利的疫苗。巴黎人的那套政治经济，已经潜伏在他心头，只要他从悠闲的旁观者一变而为现实生活中的演员，这些潜在的根苗便会立刻开花。

几乎所有的少女都会相信外貌的暗示，以为人家的心地和外表一样的美；但即使欧也妮像某些内地姑娘一样的谨慎小心，一样的目光深远，在堂兄弟的举动、言语、行为与心中憧憬还内外一致的时候，欧也妮也不见得会防他。一个偶然的机会，对欧也妮是致命伤，使她在堂兄弟年轻的心中，看到他最后一次的流露真情，听到他良心的最后几声叹息。

她把这封她认为充满爱情的信放下，心满意足地端详着睡熟的堂兄弟：她觉得这张脸上还有人生的新鲜的幻象；她先暗暗发誓要始终不渝地爱他。末了她的眼睛又转到另一封信上，再也不觉得这种冒昧的举动有什么了不得了。并且她看这封信，主要还是想对堂兄弟高尚的人格多找些新证据；而这高尚的人格，原是她像所有的女子一样推己及人地假借给爱人的：

亲爱的阿风斯，你读到这封信的时候，我已经没有朋友了；可是我尽管怀疑那班满口友谊的俗人，却没有怀疑你的友谊。所以我托你料理事情，相信你会把我所有的东西卖个好价。我的情形，想你已经知道。我一无所有了，想到印度去。刚才我写信给所有我有些欠账的人，凭我记忆所及，附上清单一纸，我的藏书、家具、车辆、马匹等等，大概足以抵偿我的私债。凡是没有什么价值的玩意儿，可以作为我做买卖的底子的，都请留下。亲爱的阿风斯，为出售那些东西，我稍缓当有正式的委托书寄上，以免有人异议。请你把我全部的枪械寄给我。至于勃列东，你可以留下自用。这匹骏马是没有人肯出足价钱的，我宁愿送给你，好像一个临死的人把常戴的戒指送给他的遗嘱执行人一样。法莱—勃莱曼车行给我造了一辆极舒服的旅行车，还没有交货，你想法叫他们留下车子，不再要我补偿损失。倘使不肯，另谋解决也可以，总以不损害我目前处境中的名誉为原则。我欠那个岛国人六路易赌债，不要忘记还给他……

“好弟弟。”欧也妮暗暗叫着，丢下了信，拿了蜡烛踅着小步溜回卧房。

到了房里，她快活得什么似的打开旧橡木柜的抽斗——文艺复兴时期最美的家具之一，上面还模模糊糊看得出法朗梭阿一世的王徽。她从抽斗内拿出一个金线坠子、金银线绣花的红丝绒钱袋，外祖母遗产里的东西。然后她很骄傲地掂了掂钱袋的分量，把她已经忘了数目的小小的积蓄检点一番。

她先理出簇新的二十枚葡萄牙金洋，一七二五年约翰五世铸造，兑换率是每枚值葡币五元，或者据她父亲说，等于一百六十八法郎六十四生丁，但一般公认的市价可以值到一百八十法郎，因为这些金洋是罕有之物，铸造极精，黄澄澄的光彩像太阳一般。

其次，是热那亚币一百元一枚的金洋五枚，也是稀见的古钱，每枚值八十七法郎，古钱收藏家可以出到一百法郎。那是从外曾祖特·拉·斐德里埃那儿来的。

其次，是三枚西班牙金洋，一七二九年斐列浦五世铸造。香蒂埃太太给她的时候老是说：“这小玩意儿，这小人头，值到九十八法郎！好娃娃，你得好好保存，将来是你私库里的宝物。”

其次，是她父亲最看重的一百荷兰杜加，一七五六年铸造，每枚约值十三法郎。成色是二十三开又零，差不多是十足的纯金。

其次，是一批罕见的古物……一般守财奴最珍视的金徽章，三枚刻着天平的卢比，五枚刻着圣母的卢比[2]，都是二十四开的纯金，蒙古大帝的货币，本身的价值是每枚三十七法郎四十生丁，玩赏黄金的收藏家至少可以出到五十法郎。

其次，是前天才拿到，她随便丢在袋里的四十法郎一枚的拿破仑。

这批宝物中间，有的是全新的，从未用过的金洋，真正的艺术品，葛朗台不时要问到，要拿出来瞧瞧，以便向女儿指出它们本身的美点，例如边缘的做工如何细巧，底子如何光亮，字体如何丰满，笔画的轮廓都没有磨蚀分毫，等等。但欧也妮那天夜里既没想到金洋的珍贵，也没想到父亲的癖性，更没想到把父亲这样珍爱的宝物脱手是如何危险；不，她只想到堂兄弟，计算之下——算法上自然不免有些小错——她终于发觉她的财产大概值到五千八百法郎，照一般的市价可以卖到六千法郎。

看到自己这么富有，她不禁高兴得拍起手来，有如一个孩子快活到了极点，必须用肉体的动作来发泄一下。这样，父女俩都盘过了自己的家私：他是为了拿黄金去卖，欧也妮是为了把黄金丢入爱情的大海。

她把金币重新装入钱袋，毫不迟疑地提了上楼。堂兄弟瞒着不给人知道的窘况，使她忘了黑夜，忘了体统，而且她的良心，她的牺牲精神，她的快乐，一切都在壮她的胆。

正当她一手蜡烛一手钱袋，踏进门口的时候，查理醒了，一看他的堂姊，便愣住了。欧也妮进房把烛火放在桌上，声音发抖地说：

“弟弟，我做了一桩非常对不起你的事；但要是你肯宽恕的话，上帝也会原谅我的罪过。”

“什么事呀？”查理擦着眼睛问。

“我把这两封信都念过了。”

查理脸红了。

“怎么会念的，”她往下说，“我为什么上楼的，老实说，我现在都想不起了。可是我念了这两封信觉得也不必后悔，因为我识得了你的灵魂，你的心，还有……”

“还有什么？”查理问。

“还有你的计划，你需要一笔款子……”

“亲爱的大姊……”

“嘘，嘘，弟弟，别高声，别惊动了人。”她一边打开钱袋一边说，“这是一个可怜的姑娘的积蓄，她根本没有用处。查理，你收下吧。今天早上，我还不知道什么叫作金钱，是你教我弄明白了，钱不过是一种工具。堂兄弟就跟兄弟差不多，你总可以借用姊姊的钱吧？”

一半还是少女一半已经成人的欧也妮，不曾防到他会拒绝，可是堂兄弟一声不出。

“哎，你不肯收吗？”欧也妮问。静寂中可以听到她的心跳。

堂兄弟的迟疑不决使她着了慌；但他身无分文的窘况，在她脑海里愈加显得清楚了，她便双膝跪下，说道：

“你不收，我就不起来！弟弟，求你开一声口，回答我呀！让我知道你肯不肯赏脸，肯不肯大度包容，是不是……”

一听到这高尚的心灵发出这绝望的呼声，查理不由得落下泪来，掉在欧也妮手上，他正握着她的手不许她下跪。欧也妮受到这几颗热泪，立刻跳过去抓起钱袋，把钱倒在桌上。

“那么你收下了，嗯？”她快活得哭着说，“不用怕，弟弟，你将来会发财的，这些金子对你有利的，将来你可以还我，而且我们可以合伙，什么条件都行。可是你不用把这笔礼看得那么重啊。”

这时查理才能够把心中的情感表白出来：“是的，欧也妮，我再不接受，未免太小心眼了。可是不能没有条件，你信托我，我也得信托你。”

“什么意思？”她害怕地问。

“听我说，好姊姊，我这里有……”

他没有说完，指着衣柜上装在皮套里的一口方匣子。

“你瞧，这里有一样东西，我看得和性命一样宝贵。这匣子是母亲给我的。从今天早上起我就想到，要是她能从坟墓里走出来，她一定会亲自把这匣上的黄金卖掉，你看她当初为了爱我，花了多少金子；但要我自己来卖，真是太亵渎了。”

欧也妮听到最后一句，不禁颤巍巍地握着堂兄弟的手。

他们静默了一会儿，彼此用水汪汪的眼睛望着，然后他又说：

“不，我既不愿把它毁掉，又不愿带着去冒路上的危险。亲爱的欧也妮，我把它交托给你。朋友之间，从没有交托一件比这个更神圣的东西。你瞧过便知道。”

他过去拿起匣子，卸下皮套，揭开盖子，伤心地给欧也妮看。手工的精巧，使黄金的价值超过了本身重量的价值，把欧也妮看得出神了。

“这还不算稀罕，”他说着揿了一下暗钮，又露出一个夹底，“瞧，我的无价之宝在这里呢。”

他掏出两张肖像，都是特·弥尔贝夫人[3]的杰作，四周镶满了珠子。

“哦，多漂亮的人！这位太太不就是你写信去……”

“不，”他微微一笑，“是我的母亲，那是父亲，就是你的叔父叔母。欧也妮，我真要跪着求你替我保存这件宝物。要是我跟你小小的家私一齐断送了，这些金子可以补偿你的损失；两张肖像我只肯交给你，你才有资格保留；可是你宁可把它们毁掉，绝不能落在第二个人手中……”

欧也妮一声不出。

“那么你答应了，是不是？”他妩媚地补上一句。

听了堂兄弟这些话，她对他望了一眼，那是钟情的女子第一次瞧爱人的眼风，又爱娇又深沉；查理拿她的手吻了一下。

“纯洁的天使！咱们之间，钱永远是无所谓的，是不是？只有感情才有价值，从今以后应当是感情高于一切。”

“你很像你的母亲。她的声音是不是像你的一样温柔？”

“哦！温柔多了……”

“对你是当然喽，”她垂下眼皮说，“喂，查理，睡觉吧，我要你睡，你累了。明儿见。”

他拿着蜡烛送她，她轻轻地把手从堂兄弟手里挣脱。两人一齐走到门口，他说：

“啊！为什么我的家败光了呢？”

“不用急，我父亲有钱呢，我相信。”她回答说。

查理在房内走前了一步，背靠着墙壁：

“可怜的孩子，他有钱就不会让我的父亲死了，也不会让你日子过得这么苦，总之他不是这么生活的。”

“可是他有法劳丰呢。”

“法劳丰能值多少？”

“我不知道，可是他还有诺阿伊哀。”

“一些起码租田！”

“还有葡萄园跟草原……”

“那更谈不上了，”查理满脸瞧不起的神气，“只要你父亲一年有两万四千法郎收入，你还会住这间又冷又寒酸的卧房吗？”他一边说一边提起左脚向前走了一步，“我的宝贝就得藏在这里面吗？”他指着一口旧箱子问，借此掩饰一下他的思想。

“去睡吧。”她不许他走进凌乱的卧房。

查理退了出去，彼此微微一笑，表示告别。

两人做着同样的梦睡去，从此查理在守丧的心中点缀了几朵蔷薇。

下一天早上，葛朗台太太看见女儿在午饭之前陪着查理散步。他还是愁容满面，正如一个不幸的人堕入了忧患的深渊、估量到苦海的深度、感觉到将来的重担以后的表情。

欧也妮看见母亲脸上不安的神色，便说：

“父亲要到吃晚饭的时候才回来呢。”

欧也妮的神色，举动，显得特别温柔的声音，都表示她与堂兄弟精神上有了默契。也许爱情的力量双方都没有深切地感到，可是他们的精神已经热烈地融成一片。查理坐在堂屋里暗自忧伤，谁也不去惊动他。三个女子都有些事情忙着。葛朗台忘了把事情交代好，家中来了不少人。瓦匠，铅管匠，泥水匠，土方工人，木匠，种园子的，管庄稼的，有的来谈判修理费，有的来付田租，有的来收账。葛朗台太太与欧也妮不得不来来往往，跟唠叨不已的工人与乡下人答话。拿侬把人家送来抵租的东西搬进厨房。她老是要等主人发令，才能知道哪些该留在家里，哪些该送到菜场上去卖。葛朗台老头的习惯，和内地大多数的乡绅一样，喝的老是坏酒，吃的老是烂果子。

傍晚五点光景，葛朗台从安越回来了，他把金子换了一万四千法郎，荷包里藏着王家库券，在没有拿去购买公债以前还有利息可拿。他把高诺阿莱留在安越，照顾那几匹累得要死的马，等它们将养好了再慢慢赶回。

“太太，我从安越回来啦，”他说，“我肚子饿了。”

“从昨天到现在没有吃过东西吗？”拿侬在厨房里嚷着问。

“没有。”老头儿回答。

拿侬端上菜汤。全家正在用饭，台·格拉桑来听取他主顾的指示了。葛朗台老头简直没有看到他的侄儿。

“你先吃饭吧，葛朗台，”银行家说，“咱们等会儿再谈。你知道安越的金价吗？有人特地从南德赶去收买。我想送一点儿去抛售。”

“不必了，”老家伙回答说，“已经到了很多。咱们是好朋友，不能让你白跑一趟。”

“可是金价到了十三法郎五十生丁呢。”

“应当说到过这个价钱。”

“你鬼使神差地又从哪儿听来的呀？”

“昨天夜里我到了安越。”葛朗台低声回答。

银行家惊讶得打了一个寒噤。随后两人咬着耳朵交谈，谈话中，台·格拉桑与葛朗台对查理望了好几次。大概是老箍桶匠说出要银行家买进十万法郎公债的时候吧，台·格拉桑又做了一个惊讶的动作。他对查理说：

“葛朗台先生，我要上巴黎去；要是你有什么事叫我办……”

“没有什么事，先生，谢谢你。”查理回答。

“能不能再谢得客气一点儿，侄儿？他是去料理琪奥默·葛朗台号子的事情的。”

“难道还有什么希望吗？”查理问。

“哎，”老箍桶匠骄傲的神气装得逼真，“你不是我的侄儿吗？你的名誉便是我们的。你不是姓葛朗台吗？”

查理站起来，抓着葛朗台老头拥抱了一下，然后脸色发白地走了出去。欧也妮望着父亲，钦佩到了万分。

“行了，再会吧，好朋友；一切拜托，把那班人灌饱迷汤再说。”

两位军师握了握手，老箍桶匠把银行家一直送到大门外，然后关了门回来，埋在安乐椅里对拿侬说：

“把果子酒拿来！”

但他过于兴奋了，没法坐下，起身瞧了瞧特·拉·斐德里埃先生的肖像，踏着拿侬所谓的舞步，嘴里唱起歌来：

法兰西的帝国军队中哎

我有过一个好爸爸……

拿侬，葛朗台太太，欧也妮，不声不响地彼此瞪了一眼。老头儿快乐到极点的时候，她们总有些害怕。

晚会不久就告结束。先是葛朗台老头要早睡；而他一睡觉，家里便应当全体睡觉：正好像奥古斯德一喝酒，波兰全国都该醉倒[4]。其次，拿侬，查理，欧也妮，疲倦也不下于主人。至于葛朗台太太，一向是依照丈夫的意志睡觉、吃喝、走路的。可是在饭后等待消化的两小时中间，从来没有那么高兴的老箍桶匠，发表了他的不少怪论，我们只要举出一两句，就可见出他的思想。他喝完了果子酒，望着杯子说：

“嘴唇刚刚碰到，杯子就干了！做人也是这样。不能要了现在，又要过去。钱不能又花出去又留在你袋里。要不然人生真是太美了。”

他说说笑笑，和气得很。拿侬搬纺车来的时候，他说：

“你也累，不用绩麻了。”

“啊，好！……不过我要厌烦呢。”女佣回答。

“可怜的拿侬，要不要来一杯果子酒？”

“啊！果子酒，我不反对；太太比药剂师做得还要好。他们卖的哪里是酒，竟是药。”

“他们糖放得太多，一点儿酒味儿都没有了。”老头儿说。

下一天早上八点钟，全家聚在一块用早餐的时候，第一次有了融融的气象。苦难已经使葛朗台太太、欧也妮和查理精神上有了联系，连拿侬也不知不觉地同情他们。四个人变了一家。至于葛朗台老头，吝啬的欲望满足了，眼见花花公子不久就要动身，除了到南德的旅费以外不用他多花一个钱，所以虽然家里住着这个客，他也不放在心上了。

他听任两个孩子——对欧也妮与查理他是这样称呼的——在葛朗台太太监督之下自由行动；关于礼教的事，他是完全信任太太的。草原与路旁的土沟要整理，洛阿河畔要种白杨，法劳丰和庄园有冬天的工作，使他没有功夫再管旁的事。从此，欧也妮进入了爱情里的春天。自从她半夜里把财宝送给了堂兄弟之后，她的心也跟着财宝一起去了。两人怀着同样的秘密，彼此瞧望的时候都表示出心心相印的了解，把他们的情感加深了，更亲密，更相契，使他们差不多生活在另一个世界上。亲族之间不作兴有温柔的口吻与含情的目光吗？因此欧也妮竭力使堂兄弟领略爱情初期的、儿童般的欢喜，来忘掉他的痛苦。

爱情的开始与生命的开始，颇有些动人的相似之处。我们不是用甜蜜的歌声与和善的目光催眠孩子吗？我们不是对他讲奇妙的故事，点缀他的前程吗？希望不是对他老展开着光明的翅翼吗？他不是忽而乐极而涕，忽而痛极而号吗？他不是为了一些无聊的小事争吵吗，或是为了造活动宫殿的石子，或是为了摘下来就忘掉的鲜花？他不是拼命要抓住时间，急于长大吗？恋爱是我们第二次的脱胎换骨。在欧也妮与查理之间，童年与爱情简直是同一桩事情：初恋的狂热，附带着一切应有的疯癫，使原来被哀伤包裹的心格外觉得安慰。

这爱情的诞生是在丧服之下挣扎出来的，所以跟这所破旧的屋子，与朴素的内地气息更显得调和。在静寂的院子里，靠井边与堂姊交谈几句；坐在园中长满青苔的凳上，一本正经地谈着废话，直到日落时分；或者在围墙下宁静的气氛中，好似在教堂的拱廊下面，一同默想：查理这才懂得了爱情的圣洁。因为他的贵族太太，他亲爱的阿纳德，只给他领略到爱情中暴风雨般的骚动。这时他离开了爱娇的、虚荣的、热闹的、巴黎式的情欲，来体味真正而纯粹的爱。他喜欢这屋子，也不觉得这屋里的生活习惯如何可笑了。

他清早就下楼，趁葛朗台来分配粮食之前，跟欧也妮谈一会儿；一听到老头儿的脚步声在楼梯上响，他马上溜进花园。这种清晨的约会，连母亲也不知道而拿侬装作看不见的约会，使他们有一点儿小小的犯罪感觉，为最纯洁的爱情添上几分偷尝禁果似的快感。等到用过早餐，葛朗台出门视察田地与种植的时光，查理便跟母女俩在一起，帮她们绕线团，看她们做活，听她们闲话，体味那从来未有的快乐。这种近乎修道院生活的朴素，把他看得大为感动，从而认识这两个不知世界为何物的灵魂之美。他本以为法国不可能再有这种风气，要就在德国，而且只是荒唐无稽的存在于奥古斯德·拉封丹[5]的小说之中。可是不久他发觉欧也妮竟是理想中的歌德的玛葛丽德，而且还没有玛葛丽德的缺点。

一天又一天，他的眼神，说话，把可怜的姑娘迷住了，一任爱情的热浪摆布；她抓着她的幸福，犹如游泳的人抓着一根杨柳枝条想上岸休息。日子飞一般地过去，其间最愉快的时光，不是已经为了即将临到的离别而显得凄凉黯淡吗？每过一天，总有一些事提醒他们。台·格拉桑走了三天之后，葛朗台带了查理上初级裁判所，庄严得了不得，那是内地人在这种场合惯有的态度；他叫查理签了一份抛弃继承权的声明书。可怕的声明！简直是离宗叛教似的文件。他又到克罗旭公证人那儿，缮就两份委托书，一份给台·格拉桑，一份给代他出售家具的朋友。随后他得填写申请书领取出国的护照。末了当查理定做的简单的孝服从巴黎送来之后，他在索漠城里叫了一个裁缝来，把多余的衣衫卖掉。这件事叫葛朗台老头大为高兴。他看见侄儿穿着粗呢的黑衣服时，便说：

“这样才像一个想出门发财的人哩。好，很好！”

“放心，伯父，”查理回答，“我知道在我现在的地位怎样做人。”

老头儿看见查理手中捧着金子，不由得眼睛一亮，问道：

“做什么？”

“伯父，我把纽扣，戒指，所有值几个钱的小东西集了起来；可是我在索漠一个人都不认识，想请你……”

“叫我买下来吗？”葛朗台打断了他的话。

“不是的，伯父，想请你介绍一个规规矩矩的人……”

“给我吧，侄儿，我到上面去替你估一估，告诉你一个准确的价值，差不了一生丁。”他把一条长的金链瞧了瞧说：

“这是首饰金，十八开到十六开。”

老头儿伸出大手把大堆金子拿走了。

“大姊，”查理说，“这两颗纽子送给你，系上一根丝带，正好套在手腕里。现在正时兴这种手镯。”

“我不客气，收下了，弟弟。”她说着对他会心地望了一眼。

“伯母，这是先母的针箍，我一向当作宝贝般放在旅行梳妆匣里的。”查理说着，把一个玲珑可爱的金顶针送给葛朗台太太，那是她想了十年而没有到手的东西。老母亲眼中含着泪，回答说：

“真不知道怎样谢你才好呢，侄儿。我做早课夜课的时候，要极诚心地祷告出门人的平安。我不在之后，欧也妮会把它保存的。”

“侄儿，一共值九百八十九法郎七十一生丁，”葛朗台推门进来说，“免得你麻烦去卖给人家，我来给你现款吧……里佛作十足算。”

在洛阿河一带，里佛作十足算的意思，是指六法郎一枚的银币，不扣成色，算足六法郎。

“我不敢开口要你买，”查理回答，“可是在你的城里变卖首饰，真有点儿不好意思。拿破仑说过，脏衣服得躲在家里洗。所以我得谢谢你的好意。”

葛朗台搔搔耳朵，一忽儿大家都没有话说。

“亲爱的伯父，”查理不安地望着他，似乎怕他多疑，“大姊跟伯母，都赏脸收了我一点儿小意思做纪念；你能不能也收下这副袖扣，我已经用不着了，可是能叫你想起一个可怜的孩子在外面没有忘掉他的骨肉。从今以后他的亲人只剩你们了。”

“我的孩子，我的孩子，你怎么能把东西送光呢？……你拿了什么，太太？”他馋痨似的转过身来问，“啊！一个金顶针。——你呢，小乖乖？噢，钻石搭扣。——好吧，孩子，你的袖扣我拿了，”他握着查理的手，“可是答应我……替你付……你的……是呀……上印度去的旅费。是的，你的路费由我来。尤其是，孩子，替你估首饰的时候，我只算了金子，也许手工还值点儿钱。所以，就这样办吧。我给你一千五百法郎……里佛作十足算，那是问克罗旭借的，家里一个铜子都没有了，除非班罗德把欠租送来。对啦，对啦，我就得找他去。”

他拿了帽子，戴上手套，走了。

“你就走了吗？”欧也妮说着，对他又悲哀又钦佩地望了一眼。

“该走了。”他低下头回答。

几天以来，查理的态度，举动，言语，显出他悲痛到了极点，可是鉴于责任的重大，已经在忧患中磨炼出簇新的勇气。他不再长吁短叹，他变为大人了。所以看到他穿着粗呢的黑衣服下楼，跟苍白的脸色与忧郁不欢的神态非常调和的时候，欧也妮把堂兄弟的性格看得更清楚了。这一天，母女俩开始戴孝，和查理一同到本区教堂去参加为琪奥默·葛朗台举行的追思弥撒。

午饭时分，查理收到几封巴黎的来信，一齐看完了。

“喂，弟弟，事情办得满意吗？”欧也妮低声问。

“女儿，不作兴问这些话，”葛朗台批评道，“嘿！我从来不说自己的事，干吗你要管堂兄弟的闲事？别打搅他。”

“噢！我没有什么秘密哪。”查理说。

“咄，咄，咄，咄！侄儿，以后你会知道，做买卖就得嘴紧。”

等到两个情人走在花园里的时候，查理挽着欧也妮坐在胡桃树下的破凳上对她说：

“我没有把阿风斯看错，他态度好极了，把我的事办得很谨慎、很忠心。我巴黎的私债全还清了，所有的家具都卖了好价钱；他又告诉我，他请教了一个走远洋的船主，把剩下的三千法郎买了一批欧洲的小玩意，可以在印度大大地赚一笔钱的货。他把我的行李都发送到南德，那边有一条船开往爪哇。不出五天，欧也妮，我们得分别了，也许是永别，至少也很长久。我的货，跟两个朋友寄给我的一万法郎，不过是小小的开头。没有好几年我休想回来。亲爱的大姊，别把你的一生跟我的放在一起，我可能死在外边，也许你有机会遇到有钱的亲事……”

“你爱我吗？……”她问。

“噢！我多爱你。”音调的深沉显得感情也是一样的深。

“我等你，查理。哟，天哪！父亲在二楼窗口。”她把逼近来想拥抱她的堂兄弟推开。

她逃到门洞下面，查理一路跟着；她躲到楼梯脚下，打开了过道里的门；后来不知怎的，欧也妮到了靠近拿侬的小房间，走道里最黑的地方；一路跟着来的查理，抓住她的手放在他心口，挽了她的腰把她轻轻地贴在自己身上。欧也妮不再抗拒了，她受了，也给了一个最纯洁、最温馨、最倾心相与的亲吻。

“亲爱的欧也妮，”查理说，“堂兄弟胜过兄弟，他可以娶你。”

“好吧，一言为定！”拿侬打开她黑房间的门嚷道。

两个情人吃了一惊，溜进堂屋，欧也妮拿起她的活计，查理拿起葛朗台太太的祷告书念着《圣母经》。

“哟！”拿侬说，“咱们都在祷告哪。”

查理一宣布行期，葛朗台便大忙特忙起来，表示对侄儿的关切；凡是不用花钱的地方他都很阔气。他去找一个装箱的木匠，回来却说箱子要价太高，便自告奋勇，定要利用家中的旧板由他自己来做；他清早起身，把薄板锯呀，刨呀，钉呀，钉成几口很好的箱子，把查理的东西全部装了进去；他又负责装上船，保了险，从水道运出，以便准时送到南德。

自从过道里一吻之后，欧也妮愈觉得日子飞也似的快得可怕。有时她竟想跟堂兄弟一起走。凡是领略过最难分割的热情的人，领略过因年龄、时间、不治的疾病，或什么宿命的打击，以致热情存在的时期一天短似一天的人，便不难懂得欧也妮的苦恼。她常常在花园里一边走一边哭，如今这园子，院子，屋子，城，为她都太窄了；她已经在茫无边际的大海上飞翔。

终于到了动身的前夜。早上，趁葛朗台与拿侬都不在家，藏有两张肖像的宝匣，给庄严地放进了柜子上唯一有锁钥而放着空钱袋的抽斗。存放的时候免不了几番亲吻几番流泪。欧也妮把钥匙藏在胸口的时光，竟没有勇气阻止查理亲吻她的胸脯。

“它永久在这里，朋友。”

“那么我的心也永久在这里。”

“啊！查理，这不行。”她略带几分埋怨的口气。

“我们不是已经结婚了吗？”他回答，“你已经答应了我，现在要由我来许愿了。”

“永久是你的！”这句话双方都说了两遍。

世界上再没比这个誓约更纯洁的了：欧也妮的天真烂漫，一刹那间把查理的爱情也变得神圣了。

下一天早上，早餐是不愉快的。拿侬虽然受了查理的金绣睡衣与挂在胸间的十字架，还没有被感情蒙蔽，这时却也禁不住含了眼泪：

“可怜的好少爷，要去漂洋过海……但愿上帝保佑他！”

十点半，全家出门送查理搭去南德的驿车。拿侬放了狗，关了街门，定要替查理拎随身的小包。老街上所有做买卖的，都站在门口看他们一行走过，到了广场，还有公证人候在那里。

“欧也妮，等会儿别哭。”母亲嘱咐她。

葛朗台在客店门口拥抱查理，吻着他的两颊：

“侄儿，你光身去，发了财回来，你父亲的名誉绝不会有一点儿损害。我葛朗台敢替你保险；因为那时候，都靠你……”

“啊！伯父！这样我动身也不觉得太难受了。这不是你送我的最好的礼物吗！”

查理把老箍桶匠的话打断了，根本没有懂他的意思，却在伯父面疱累累的脸上流满了感激的眼泪；欧也妮使劲握着堂兄弟与父亲的手。只有公证人在那里微笑，暗暗佩服葛朗台的机巧，因为只有他懂得老头儿的心思[6]。

四个索漠人，周围还有几个旁人，站在驿车前面一直等到它出发；然后当车子在桥上看不见了，只远远听到声音的时候，老箍桶匠说了声：

“一路顺风！”

幸而只有克罗旭公证人听到这句话。欧也妮和母亲已经走到码头上还能望见驿车的地方，扬着她们的白手帕，查理也在车中扬巾回应。赶到欧也妮望不见查理的手帕时，她说：

“母亲，要有上帝的法力多好啊！”





为的不要岔断以后葛朗台家中的事，且把老头儿托台·格拉桑在巴黎办的事情提前叙述一下。银行家出发了一个月之后，葛朗台在国库的总账上登记了正好以八十法郎买进的十万公债。这多疑的家伙用什么方法把买公债的款子拨到巴黎，直到他死后人家编造他的财产目录时都无法知道。克罗旭公证人认为是拿侬不自觉地做了运送款子的工具。因为那个时节，女仆有五天不在家，说是到法劳丰收拾东西去，仿佛老头儿真会有什么东西丢在那里不收起来似的。关于琪奥默·葛朗台号子的事，竟不出老箍桶匠的预料。

大家知道，法兰西银行对巴黎与各省的巨富都有极准确的调查。索漠的台·格拉桑与斐列克斯·葛朗台都榜上有名，而且像一般拥有大地产而绝对没有抵押出去的金融家一样，信用极好。所以索漠的银行家到巴黎来清算葛朗台债务的传说，立刻使债权人放弃了签署拒绝证书[7]的念头，从而使已故的葛朗台少受了一次羞辱。财产当着债权人的面启封，本家的公证人照例进行财产登记。不久，台·格拉桑把债权人召集了，他们一致推举索漠的银行家和一家大商号的主人，同时也是主要债权人之一的法朗梭阿·凯勒为清算人，把挽救债权与挽回葛朗台的信誉两件事，一齐委托了他们。索漠的葛朗台的信用，加上台·格拉桑银号代他做的宣传，使债权人都存了希望，因而加增了谈判的便利；不肯就范的债主居然一个都没有。谁也不曾把债权放在自己的盈亏总账上计算过，只想着：

“索漠的葛朗台会偿还的！”

六个月过去了，那些巴黎人把转付出去的葛朗台债券清偿了，收回来藏在皮包里。这是老箍桶匠所要达到的第一个目标。

第一次集会以后九个月，两位清算人发了百分之四十七给每个债权人。这笔款子是把已故的葛朗台的证券、动产、不动产，以及一切零星杂物变卖得来的，变卖的手续做得极精密。

那次的清算办得公正规矩，毫无弊窦。债权人一致承认葛朗台两兄弟的信誉的确无可批评。等到这种赞美的话在外边传播了一番以后，债权人要求还余下的部分了。那时他们写了一封全体签名的信给葛朗台。

“嗯，哼！这个吗？”老箍桶匠把信往火里一扔，“朋友们，耐一耐性子吧。”

葛朗台的答复，是要求把所有的债权文件存放在一个公证人那里，另外附一张已付款项的收据，以便核对账目，把遗产的总账轧清。这个条件立刻引起了无数的争执。

债主通常总是脾气古怪的家伙：今天预备成立协议了，明天又嚷着烧呀杀呀，把一切都推翻；过了一晌，又忽然的软下来。今天，他的太太兴致好，小儿子牙齿长得顺利，家里什么都如意，他便一个铜子都不肯吃亏；明儿，逢着下雨，不能出门，心里憋闷得慌，只消一件事情能够结束，便任何条件都肯答应；后天，他要担保品了；月底，他要你全部履行义务，非把你逼死不可，这刽子手！大人开小孩子玩笑，说要捉小鸟，只消把一粒盐放在它尾巴上。世界上要有这种呆鸟的话，就是债主了。或者是他们把自己的债权看作那样的呆鸟，结果是永远扑一个空。

葛朗台留神观看债主的风色，而他兄弟的那批债主的确不出他的所料。有的生气了，把存放证件一节干脆拒绝了。

“好吧，好得很。”葛朗台念着台·格拉桑的来信，搓着手说。

另外一批债权人答应提交证件，可是要求把他们的权利确切证明一下，声明任何权利不能放弃，甚至要保留破产的权利。再通信，再磋商，结果索漠的葛朗台把对方提出的保留的条件全部接受了。获得了这点儿让步之后，温和派的债主把激烈派的劝解了。大家咕噜了一阵。证件终于交了出来。

“这好家伙，”有人对台·格拉桑说，“简直跟你和我们开玩笑。”

琪奥默·葛朗台死了两年差一个月的时候，许多商人给巴黎市场的动荡搅昏了，把葛朗台到期应付的款项也忘了，或者即使想到，也不过是“大概百分之四十七就是我们所能到手的全部了”一类的想法。

老箍桶匠素来相信时间的力量，他说时间是一个好小鬼。第三年年终，台·格拉桑写信给葛朗台，说债权人已经答应，在结欠的二百四十万法郎中再收一成，就可把债券交还。

葛朗台复信说，闹了亏空把他兄弟害死的那个公证人与经纪人，倒逍遥地活着！他们不应当负担一部分吗？现在要对他们起诉，逼他们拿出钱来，减轻一点儿我们这方面的亏累。

第四年终了，欠款的数目讲定了十二万法郎。然后清算人与债权人，清算人与葛朗台，往返磋商，拖了六个月之久。总而言之，赶到葛朗台被逼到非付不可的时节，在那年的第九个月，他又回信给两位清算人，说他侄子在印度发了财，向他表示要把亡父的债务全部归清；他不能擅自了结这笔债，要等侄子回音。

第五年过了一半，债权人还是给“全部归清”几个字搪塞着，老奸巨猾的箍桶匠暗地里笑着，把“全部归清”的话不时说一遍。每逢嘴里提到“这些巴黎人！……”时，他总得附带一副阴险的笑容，赌一句咒。可是那些债主最后的命运，却是商场大事记上从来未有的纪录。后来，当这个故事的发展使他们重新出场的时候，他们所处的地位，还是当初给葛朗台冻结在那里的地位。

公债涨到一百一十五法郎，葛朗台老头抛了出去，在巴黎提回二百四十万法郎左右的黄金，和公债上的复利六十万法郎，一齐倒进了密室内的木桶。台·格拉桑一直留在巴黎，原因是：第一，他当了国会议员；第二，他虽然当了家长，却给索漠的生活磨得厌烦死了，爱上了公主剧院最漂亮的一个女演员弗洛琳，他当年军队生活的习气又在银行家身上复活了。不用说，他的行为给索漠人一致认为伤风败俗。他太太还算运气，跟他分了家，居然有魄力管理索漠的银号，用她的名字继续营业，把台·格拉桑因荒唐而败掉的家私设法弥补。几位克罗旭推波助澜，把这个活寡妇的尴尬地位弄得更糟，以致她的女儿嫁得很不得意，娶欧也妮·葛朗台做媳妇的念头也放弃了，阿道夫跟台·格拉桑一起在巴黎，据说变得很下流。克罗旭他们终于得胜了。

“你丈夫真糊涂，”葛朗台凭了抵押品借一笔钱给台·格拉桑太太时说，“我代你抱怨，你倒是一个贤惠的太太。”

“啊！先生，”可怜的妇人回答说，“他从你府上动身到巴黎去的那一天，谁想得到他就此走上了坏路呢？”

“太太，皇天在上，我直到最后还拦着不让他去呢。当时所长先生极想亲自出马的。我们现在才明白为什么他争着要去。”

这样，葛朗台便用不到再欠台·格拉桑什么情分了。

家庭的苦难


不论处境如何，女人的痛苦总比男人多，而且程度也更深。男人有他的精力需要发挥：他活动，奔走，忙乱，打主意，眼睛看着将来，觉得安慰。例如查理。但女人是静止的，面对着悲伤无法分心，悲伤替她开了一个窟窿，给她往下钻，一直钻到底，测量窟窿的深度，把她的愿望与眼泪来填满。例如欧也妮。她开始认识了自己的命运。感受，爱，受苦，牺牲，永远是女人生命中应有的文章。欧也妮变得整个儿是女人了，却并无女人应有的安慰。她的幸福，正如鲍舒哀刻画入微的说法，仿佛在墙上找出来的钉子，随你积得怎么多，捧在手里也永远遮不了掌心的。悲苦绝不姗姗来迟地叫人久等，而她的一份就在眼前了。查理动身的下一天，葛朗台的屋子在大家眼里又恢复了本来面目，只有欧也妮觉得突然之间空虚得厉害。瞒着父亲，她要把查理的卧房保存他离开时的模样。葛朗台太太与拿侬，很乐意助成她这个维持现状的愿望。

“谁保得定他不早些回来呢？”她说。

“啊！希望他再来噢，”拿侬回答，“我服侍他惯了！多和气，多好的少爷，脸庞儿又俏，头发卷卷的像一个姑娘。”

欧也妮望着拿侬。

“哎哟，圣母玛利亚！小姐，你这副眼睛要入地狱的！别这样瞧人呀。”

从这天起，葛朗台小姐的美丽又是一番面目。对爱情的深思，慢慢地浸透了她的心，再加上有了爱人以后的那种庄严，使她眉宇之间多添了画家用光轮来表现的那种光辉。堂兄弟未来之前，欧也妮可以跟未受圣胎的童贞女相比；堂兄弟走了之后，她有些像做了圣母的童贞女：她已经感受了爱情。某些西班牙画家把这两个不同的玛利亚表现得那么出神入化，成为基督教艺术中最多而最有光辉的造像。查理走后，她发誓天天要去望弥撒；第一次从教堂回来，她在书店里买了一幅环球全国钉在镜子旁边，为的能一路跟堂兄弟上印度，早晚置身于他的船上，看到他，对他提出无数的问话，对他说：

“你好吗？不难受吗？你教我认识了北极星的美丽和用处，现在你看到了那颗星，想我不想？”

早上，她坐在胡桃树下虫蛀而生满青苔的凳上出神，他们在那里说过多少甜言蜜语，多少疯疯癫癫的废话，也一起做过将来成家以后的美梦。她望着围墙上空的一角青天，想着将来；然后又望望古老的墙壁，与查理卧房的屋顶。总之，这是孤独的爱情，持久的，真正的爱情，渗透所有的思想，变成了生命的本体，或者像我们父辈所说的，变成了生命的素材。

晚上，那些自称为葛朗台老头的朋友来打牌的时候，她装作很高兴，把真情藏起；但整个上午她跟母亲与拿侬谈论查理。拿侬懂得她可以跟小主人表同情，而并不有亏她对老主人的职守，她对欧也妮说：

“要是有个男人真心对我，我会……会跟他入地狱。我会……哦……我会为了他送命；可是……没有呀。人生一世是怎么回事，我到死也不会知道的了。唉，小姐，你知道吗，高诺阿莱那老头，人倒是挺好的，老盯着我打转，自然是为了我的积蓄喽，正好比那些为了来嗅嗅先生的金子，有心巴结你的人。我看得很清，别看我像猪一样胖，我可不傻呢。可是小姐，虽然他那个不是爱情，我也觉得高兴。”

两个月这样过去了。从前那么单调的日常生活，因大家关切欧也妮的秘密而有了生气，三位妇人也因之更加亲密。在她们心目中，查理依旧在堂屋灰暗的楼板上面走来走去。早晨，夜晚，欧也妮都得把那口梳妆匣打开一次，把叔母的肖像端详一番。某星期日早上，她正一心对着肖像揣摩查理的面貌时，被母亲撞见了。于是葛朗台太太知道了侄儿与欧也妮交换宝物的可怕的消息。

“你统统给了他！”母亲惊骇之下说，“到元旦那天，父亲问你要金洋看的时候，你怎么说？”

欧也妮眼睛发直，一个上半天，母女俩吓得半死，糊里糊涂把正场的弥撒都错过了，只能参加读唱弥撒。

三天之内，一八一九年就要告终。三天之内就要发生大事，要演出没有毒药、没有尖刀、没有流血的平凡的悲剧，但对于剧中人的后果，只有比弥赛纳王族里所有的惨剧还要残酷。

“那怎么办？”葛朗台太太把编织物放在了膝上，对女儿说。

可怜的母亲，两个月以来受了那么多的搅扰，甚至过冬必不可少的毛线套袖都还没织好。这件家常小事，表面上无关紧要，对她却发生了不幸的后果。因为没有套袖，后来在丈夫大发雷霆骇得她一身冷汗时，她中了恶寒。

“我想，可怜的孩子，要是你早告诉我，还来得及写信到巴黎给台·格拉桑先生。他有办法收一批差不多的金洋寄给我们；虽然你父亲看得极熟，也许……”

“可是哪儿来这一大笔钱呢？”

“有我的财产做抵押呀。再说台·格拉桑先生可能为我们……”

“太晚啦，”欧也妮声音嘶哑，嗓子异样地打断了母亲的话，“明天早上，我们就得到他卧房里去跟他拜年了。”

“可是孩子，为什么我们不去看看克罗旭他们呢？”

“不行不行，那简直是自投罗网，把我们卖给了他们了。而且我已经拿定主意。我没有做错事，一点儿不后悔。上帝会保佑我的。听凭天意吧。唉！母亲，要是你读到他那些信，你也要心心念念地想他呢。”

下一天早上，一八二〇年一月一日，母女俩恐怖之下，想出了最天然的托词，不像往年一样郑重其事地到他卧房里拜年。一八一九至一八二〇的冬天，在当时是一个最冷的冬天。屋顶上都堆满了雪。

葛朗台太太一听到丈夫在房里有响动，便说：

“葛朗台，叫拿侬在我屋里生个火吧；冷气真厉害，我在被窝里冻僵了。到了这个年纪，不得不保重一点儿。”她停了一会又说，“再说，让欧也妮到我房里来穿衣吧。这种天气，孩子在她屋里梳洗会闹病的。等会儿我们到暖暖和和的堂屋里跟你拜年吧。”

“咄，咄，咄，咄！官话连篇！太太，这算是新年发利市吗？你从来没有这样唠叨过。你总不见得吃了酒浸面包[1]吧？”

说罢大家都不出一声。

“好吧，”老头儿大概听了妻子的话心软了，“就照你的意思办吧，太太。你太好了，我不能让你在这个年纪上有什么三长两短，虽然拉·斐德里埃家里的人多半是铁打的。”他停了一忽又嚷：“嗯！你说是不是？不过咱们得了他们的遗产，我原谅他们。”

说完他咳了几声。

“今天早上你开心得很，老爷。”葛朗台太太的口气很严肃。

“我不是永远开心的吗，我……

开心，开心，真开心，你这箍桶匠，

不修补你的脸盆又怎么样！”

他一边哼一边穿得齐齐整整的进了妻子的卧房。“真，好家伙，冷得要命。早上咱们有好菜吃呢，太太。台·格拉桑从巴黎带了夹香菇的鹅肝来！我得上驿站去拿。”说着他又咬着她的耳朵：

“他还给欧也妮带来一块值两块的拿破仑。我的金子光了，太太。我还有几块古钱，为了做买卖只好花了。这话我只能告诉你一个人。”

然后他吻了吻妻子的前额，表示庆祝新年。

“欧也妮，”母亲叫道，“不知你父亲做了什么好梦，脾气好得很。——得啦，咱们还有希望。”

“先生今天怎么啦？”拿侬到太太屋里生火时说，“他一看见我就说：大胖子，你好，你新年快乐。去给太太生火呀，她好冷呢。——他说着伸出手来给我一块六法郎的钱，精光滴滑，簇崭全新，把我看呆了。太太，你瞧。哦！他多好。他真大方。有的人越老心越硬；他却温和得像你的果子酒一样，越陈越好了。真是一个十足地道的好人……”

老头儿这一天的快乐，是因为投机完全成功的缘故。台·格拉桑把箍桶匠的十五万法郎在荷兰证券上所欠的利息，以及买进十万公债时代垫的尾数除去之后，把一季的利息三万法郎托驿车带给了他，同时又报告他公债上涨的消息。行市已到八十九法郎，那些最有名的资本家，还出九十二法郎的价钱买进正月底的期货。葛朗台两个月中间的投资赚了百分之十二，他业已收支两讫，今后每半年可以坐收五万法郎，既不用付捐税，也没有什么修理费。内地人素来不相信公债的投资，他却终于弄明白了，预算不出五年，不用费多少心，他的本利可以滚到六百万，再加上田产的价值，他的财产势必达到惊人的数字。给拿侬的六法郎，也许是她不自觉地帮了他一次大忙而得到的酬劳。

“噢！噢！葛朗台老头上哪儿去呀，一清早就像救火似的这么奔？”街上做买卖的一边开铺门一边想。

后来，他们看见他从码头上回来，后面跟着驿站上的一个脚夫，独轮车上的袋都是满满的。有的人便说：“水总是往河里流的，老头儿去拿钱哪。”

“巴黎，法劳丰，荷兰，流到他家里来的水可多哩。”另外一个说。

“临了，索漠城都要给他买下来喽。”第三个又道。

“他不怕冷，”一个女人对她的丈夫说，“老忙着他的事。”

“嗨！嗨！葛朗台先生，”跟他最近的邻居，一个布商招呼他，“你觉得累赘的话，我来给你扔了吧。”

“哦！不过是些大钱罢了。”葡萄园主回答。

“是银子呢。”脚夫低声补上一句。

“哼，要我照应吗，闭上你的嘴。”老头儿一边开门一边对脚夫咕噜。

“啊！老狐狸，我拿他当作聋子，”脚夫心里想，“谁知冷天他倒听得清。”

“给你二十个子儿酒钱，得啦！去你的！”葛朗台对他说，“你的独轮车，等会叫拿侬来还你。——娘儿们是不是在望弥撒，拿侬？”

“是的，先生。”

“好，快，快一点儿！”他嚷着把那些袋子交给她。

一眨眼，钱都装进了他的密室，他关上了门，躲在里面。

“早餐预备好了，你来敲我的墙壁。先把独轮车送回驿站。”

到了十点钟，大家才吃早点。

“在堂屋里父亲不会要看你金洋的，”葛朗台太太望弥撒回来对女儿说，“再说，你可以装作怕冷。挨过了今天，到你过生日的时候，我们好想法把你的金子凑起来……”

葛朗台一边下楼一边想着把巴黎送来的钱马上变成黄金，又想着公债上的投机居然这样成功。他决意把所有的收入都投资进去，直到行市涨到一百法郎为止。他这样一盘算，欧也妮便倒了霉。他进了堂屋，两位妇女立刻给他拜年，女儿跳上去搂着他的脖子撒娇，太太却是又庄严又稳重。

“啊！啊！我的孩子，”他吻着女儿的前额，“我为你辛苦呀，你不看见吗？……我要你享福。享福就得有钱。没有钱，什么都完啦。瞧，这儿是一个簇新的拿破仑，特地为你从巴黎弄来的，天！家里一点儿金屑子都没有了，只有你有。小乖乖，把你的金子拿来让我瞧瞧。”

“哦！好冷呀；先吃早点吧。”欧也妮回答。

“行，那么吃过早点再拿，是不是？那好帮助我们消化。——台·格拉桑那胖子居然送了这东西来。喂，大家吃呀，又不花我的钱。他不错，这台·格拉桑，我很满意。好家伙给查理帮忙，而且尽义务。他把我可怜的兄弟的事办得很好。——嗯哼！嗯哼！”他含着一嘴食物嘟囔，停了一下又道，“嗯！好吃！太太，你吃呀！至少好叫你饱两天。”

“我不饿，你知道，我一向病病歪歪的。”

“哎！哎！你把肚子塞饱也不打紧，你是拉·裴德里埃家出身，结实得很。你真像一根小黄草，可是我就喜欢黄颜色。”

一个囚徒在含垢忍辱，当众就戮之前，他没有葛朗台太太母女俩在等待早点以后的大祸时那么害怕。葛朗台老头越讲得高兴，越吃得起劲，母女俩的心抽得越紧。但是做女儿的这时还有一点儿依傍：在爱情中汲取勇气。她心里想：

“为了他，为了他，千刀万剐我也受。”

这么想着，她望着母亲，眼中射出勇敢的火花。

十一点，早餐完了，葛朗台唤拿侬：

“统统拿走，把桌子留下。这样，我们看起你的宝贝来更舒服些，”他望着欧也妮说，“孩子！真的，你十十足足有了五千九百五十九法郎的财产，加上今天早上的四十法郎，一共是六千法郎差一个。好吧，我补你一法郎凑足整数，因为小乖乖，你知道……哎哎，拿侬，你干吗听我们说话？去吧，去做你的事。”

拿侬走了。

“听我说，欧也妮，你得把金子给我。你不会拒绝爸爸吧，嗯，我的小乖乖？”

母女俩都不出一声。

“我吗，我没有金子了。从前有的，现在没有了。我把六千法郎现款跟你换，你照我的办法把这笔款子放出去。别想什么压箱钱了。我把你出嫁的时候——也很快了——我会替你找一个夫婿，给你一笔本省从来没有听见过的，最体面的压箱钱。小乖乖，你听我说，现在有一个好机会：你可以把六千法郎买公债，半年就有近两百法郎利息，没有捐税，没有修理费，不怕冰雹，不怕冻，不怕涨潮，一切跟年成捣乱的玩意儿全没有。也许你不乐意把金子放手，小乖乖？拿来吧，还是拿给我吧。以后我再替你收金洋，什么荷兰的，葡萄牙的，蒙古[2]卢比，热那亚金洋，再加你每年生日我给你的，要不了三年，你那份美丽的小家私就恢复了一半。你怎么说，小乖乖？抬起头来呀。去吧，我的儿，去拿来。我这样地把钱怎么生怎么死的秘密告诉了你，你该吻一吻我的眼睛谢我喽。真的，钱像人一样是活的，会动的，它会来，会去，会流汗，会生产。”

欧也妮站起身子向门口走了几步，忽然转过身来，定睛望着父亲，说：

“我的金子没有了。”

“你的金子没有了！”葛朗台嚷着，两腿一挺，直站起来，仿佛一匹马听见身旁有大炮在轰。

“没有了。”

“不会的，欧也妮。”

“真是没有了。”

“爷爷的锹子！”

每逢箍桶匠赌到这个咒，连楼板都会发抖的。

“哎哟，好天好上帝！太太脸都白了。”拿侬嚷道。

“葛朗台，你这样冒火，把我吓死了。”可怜的妇人说。

“咄，咄，咄，咄！你们，你们家里的人是死不了的！欧也妮，你的金洋怎么啦？”他扑上去大吼。

“父亲，”女儿在葛朗台太太身旁跪了下来，“妈妈难受成这样……你瞧……别把她逼死啊。”

葛朗台看见太太平时那么黄黄的脸完全发白了，也害怕起来。

“拿侬，扶我上去睡，”她声音微弱地说，“我要死了。”

拿侬和欧也妮赶紧过去搀扶，她走一步软一步，两个人费了好大气力才把她扶进卧房。葛朗台独自留在下面。可是过了一会儿，他走上七八级楼梯，直着嗓子喊：

“欧也妮，母亲睡了就下来。”

“是，父亲。”

她把母亲安慰了一番，赶紧下楼。

“欧也妮，”父亲说，“告诉我你的金子哪儿去了？”

“父亲，要是你给我的东西不能完全由我做主，那么你拿回去吧。”欧也妮冷冷地回答，一边在壁炉架上抓起拿破仑还他。

葛朗台气冲冲地一手抢过来，塞在荷包里。

“哼，你想我还会给你什么东西吗！连这个也不给！”说着他把大拇指扳着门牙，的一声。“你瞧不起父亲？居然不相信他？你不知什么叫作父亲？要不是父亲高于一切，也就不称其为父亲了。你的金子哪儿去了？”

“父亲，你尽管生气，我还是爱你，敬重你；可是原谅我大胆提一句，我已经二十三岁了。你常常告诉我，说我已经成年，为的是要我知道。所以我把我的钱照我自己的意思安排了，而且请你放心，我的钱放得很妥当……”

“放在哪里？”

“秘密不可泄露，”她说，“你不是有你的秘密吗？”

“我不是家长吗？我不能有我的事吗？”

“这却是我的事。”

“那一定是坏事，所以你不能对父亲说，小姐！”

“的确是好事，就是不能对父亲说。”

“至少得告诉我，什么时候把金子拿出去的？”

欧也妮摇摇头。

“你生日那天还在呢，是不是？”

欧也妮被爱情训练出来的狡猾，不下于父亲被吝啬训练出来的狡猾，她仍旧摇摇头。

“从来没见过这样的死心眼儿，这样的偷盗，”葛朗台声音越来越大，震动屋子，“怎么！这里，在我自己家里，居然有人拿掉你的金子，家里就是这么一点儿的金子！而我还没法知道是谁拿的！金子是宝贵的东西呀。不错，最老实的姑娘也免不了有过失，甚至于把什么都给了人，上至世家旧族，下至小户人家，都有的是；可是把金子送人！因为你一定是给了什么人的，是不是？”

欧也妮声色不动。

“这样的姑娘倒从来没有见到过！我是不是你的父亲？要是存放出去，你一定有收据……”

“我有支配这笔钱的权利没有？有没有？是不是我的钱？”

“哎，你还是一个孩子呢！”

“成年了。”

给女儿驳倒了，葛朗台脸色发白，跺脚，发誓，终于又想出了话：

“你这个该死的婆娘，你这条毒蛇！唉！坏东西，你知道我疼你，你就胡来。你勒死你的父亲！哼！你会把咱们的家产一齐送给那个穿摩洛哥皮鞋的光棍。爷爷的锹子！我不能取消你的承继权，天哪！可是我要咒你，咒你的堂兄弟，咒你的儿女！他们都不会对你有什么好结果的，听见没有？要是你给了查理……哦，不可能的。怎么！这油头粉脸的坏蛋，胆敢偷我的……”

他望着女儿，她冷冷地一声不出。

“她动也不动！眉头也不皱一皱！比我葛朗台还要葛朗台。至少你不会把金子白送人吧，嗯，你说？”

欧也妮望着父亲，含讥带讽的眼神把他气坏了。

“欧也妮，你是在我家里，在你父亲家里。要留在这儿，就得服从父亲的命令。神父他们也命令你服从我。”

欧也妮低下头去。他接着又说：

“你就拣我最心疼的事伤我的心，你不屈服，我就不要看见你。到房里去。我不许你出来，你就不能出来。只有冷水跟面包，我叫拿侬端给你。听见没有？去！”

欧也妮哭作一团，急忙溜到母亲身边。

葛朗台在园中雪地里忘了冷，绕了好一会儿圈子，之后，忽然疑心女儿在他妻子房里，想到去当场捉住她违抗命令的错儿，不由得高兴起来，他便像猫儿一般轻捷地爬上楼梯，闯进太太的卧房，看见欧也妮的脸埋在母亲怀里，母亲摩着她的头发，说：

“别伤心，可怜的孩子，你父亲的气慢慢会消下去的。”

“她没有父亲了！”老箍桶匠吼道，“这样不听话的女儿是我跟你生的吗，太太？好教育，还是信教的呢！怎么，你不在自己房里？赶快，去坐牢，坐牢，小姐。”

“你硬要把我们娘儿俩拆开吗，老爷？”葛朗台太太发着烧，脸色通红。

“你要留她，你就把她带走，你俩给我一齐离开这儿……天打的！金子呢？金子怎么啦？”

欧也妮站起身子，高傲地把父亲望了一眼，走进自己的卧房。她一进去，老头儿把门锁上了。

“拿侬，把堂屋里的火熄掉。”他嚷道。

然后他坐在太太屋里壁炉旁边的一张安乐椅上：

“她一定给了那个迷人的臭小子查理，他只想我的钱。”

葛朗台太太为了女儿所冒的危险，为了她对女儿的感情，居然鼓足勇气，装聋作哑，冷静得很。

“这些我都不知道。”她一边回答，一边朝床里翻身，躲开丈夫闪闪发光的眼风。“你生这么大的气，我真难受；我预感我只能伸直着腿出去的了。现在你可以饶我一下吧，我从来没有给你受过气，至少我自己这样想。女儿是爱你的，我相信她跟初生的孩子一样没有罪过。别难为她。收回成命吧。天冷得厉害，说不定你会叫她闹场大病的。”

“我不愿意看见她，也不再跟她说话。她得关在屋里，只有冷水面包，直到她使父亲满意为止。见鬼！做家长的不该知道家里的黄金到了哪儿去吗？她的卢比恐怕全法国都找不出来，还有热那亚金洋，荷兰杜加……”

“老爷，我们只生欧也妮一个，即使她把金子扔在水里……”

“扔在水里！扔在水里！”好家伙嚷道，“你疯了，太太。我说得到，做得到，你还不知道吗？你要求家里太平，就该叫女儿招供，逼她老实说出来；女人对女人，比我们男人容易说得通。不管她做了什么事，我绝不会把她吃掉。她是不是怕我？即使她把堂兄弟从头到脚装了金，唉，他早已漂洋出海，我们也追不上了……”

“那么，老爷……”

由于当时的神经过敏，或者是女儿的苦难使她格外慈爱，也格外聪明起来，葛朗台太太犀利的目光发觉丈夫的肉瘤有些可怕的动作，她便马上改变主意，顺着原来的口吻，说：

“那么，老爷，你对女儿没有办法，我倒有办法了吗？她一句话也没有对我说，她像你。”

“嗯，哼！今天你多会说话！咄，咄，咄，咄！你欺侮我。说不定你跟她通气的。”

他定睛瞪着妻子。

“真的，你要我命，就这样说下去吧。我已经告诉你，先生，即使把我的命送掉，我还是要告诉你：你这样对女儿是不应该的，她比你讲理。这笔钱是她的，她不会糟掉，我们做的好事，只有上帝知道。老爷，我求你，饶了欧也妮吧！……你饶了她，我受的打击也可以减轻一些，也许你救了我的命，我的女儿呀，先生，还我女儿啊！”

“我走啦，”他说，“家里待不下去了，娘儿俩的念头，说话，都好像……勃罗……啵！你好狠心，送了我这笔年礼，欧也妮！”他提高了嗓子，“好，好，哭吧！这种行为，你将来要后悔的，听见没有？一个月吃两次好天爷的圣餐有什么用？既然会把你父亲的钱偷偷送给一个游手好闲的光棍！他把你什么都吃完之后，还会吃掉你的心呢！你瞧着吧，你的查理是什么东西，穿着摩洛哥皮鞋目空一切！他没有心肝，没有灵魂，敢把一个姑娘的宝贝，不经她父母允许，带着就跑。”

街门关上了，欧也妮便走出卧房，挨在母亲身边，对她说：

“你为了你女儿真有勇气。”

“孩子，瞧见没有，一个人做了违禁的事落到什么田地！……你逼我撒了一次谎。”

“噢！我求上帝只罚我一个人就是了。”

“真的吗，”拿侬慌张地跑来问，“小姐从此只有冷水面包好吃？”

“那有什么大不了，拿侬？”欧也妮冷静地回答。

“啊！东家的女儿只吃干面包，我还咽得下什么糖酱……噢，不，不！”

“这些话都不用提，拿侬。”欧也妮说。

“我就不开口好啦，可是你等着瞧吧！”

二十四年以来第一次，葛朗台独自用晚餐。

“哎哟，你变了单身汉了，先生，”拿侬说，“家里有了两个妇女还做单身汉，真不是味儿哪。”

“我不跟你说话。闭上你的嘴，要不我就赶你走。你蒸锅里煮的什么，在灶上噗噗噗的？”

“熬油哪……”

“晚上有客，你得生火。”

八点钟，几位克罗旭，台·格拉桑太太和她儿子一齐来了，他们很奇怪没有见到葛朗台太太与欧也妮。

“内人有点儿不舒服，欧也妮陪着她。”老头儿若无其事地回答。

闲扯了一小时，上楼上去问候葛朗台太太的台·格拉桑太太下来了，大家争着问：

“葛朗台太太怎么样？”

“不行，简直不行，”她说，“她的情形真叫人担心。在她的年纪，要特别小心才好呢，葛老头。”

“慢慢瞧吧。”老头儿心不在焉地问答。

大家告辞了。几位克罗旭走到了街上，台·格拉桑太太便告诉他们：

“葛朗台家出了什么事啦。母亲病得很厉害，自己还不知道。女儿红着眼睛，仿佛哭过很久，难道他们硬要把她攀亲吗？”

老头儿睡下了，拿侬穿着软鞋无声无息地走进欧也妮卧房，给她一个用蒸锅做的大肉饼。

“喂，小姐，”好心的用人说，“高诺阿莱给了我一只野兔。你胃口小，这个饼好吃八天；冻紧了，不会坏的。至少你不用吃淡面包了。那多伤身体。”

“可怜的拿侬！”欧也妮握着她的手。

“我做得很好，煮得很嫩，他一点儿不知道。肥肉，香料，都在我的六法郎里面买。这几个钱总是由我做主的了。”

然后她以为听到了葛朗台的声音，马上溜了。

几个月工夫，老头儿拣着白天不同的时间，经常来看太太，绝口不提女儿，也不去看她，也没有间接关涉到她的话。葛朗台太太老睡在房里，病情一天一天地严重，可是什么都不能使老箍桶匠的心软一软。他顽强，严酷，冰冷，像一块石头。他按照平时的习惯上街，回家，可是不再口吃，说话也少了，在买卖上比从前更苛刻，弄错数目的事也常有。

“葛朗台家里出了事啦。”克罗旭党与台·格拉桑党都这么说。

“葛朗台家究竟闹些什么啊？”索漠人在随便哪家的晚会上遇到，总这样地彼此问一声。

欧也妮上教堂，总由拿侬陪着。从教堂出来，倘使台·格拉桑太太跟她说话，她的回答总是躲躲闪闪的，叫人不得要领。虽然如此，两个月之后，欧也妮被幽禁的秘密终于瞒不过三位克罗旭与台·格拉桑太太。她的老不见客，到了某个时候，也没有理由好推托了。后来，不知是谁透露了出去，全城都知道从元旦起，葛朗台小姐被父亲软禁在房里，只有清水面包，没有取暖的火，倒是拿侬替小姐弄些好菜半夜里送进去；大家也知道女儿只能候父亲上街的时间去探望母亲，服侍母亲。

于是葛朗台的行为动了公愤。全城仿佛当他是化外之人，又记起了他的出卖地主和许多刻薄的行为，大有一致唾弃之概。他走在街上，个个人在背后交头接耳。

当女儿由拿侬陪了去望弥撒或做晚祷，在弯弯曲曲的街上走着的时候，所有的人全扑上窗口，好奇地打量那有钱的独养女儿的脸色与态度，发觉她除了满面愁容之外，另有一副天使般温柔的表情。她的幽禁与失宠，对她全不相干。她不是老看着世界地图、花园、围墙、小凳吗？爱情的亲吻留在嘴唇上的甜味，她不是老在回味吗？城里关于她的议论，她好久都不知道，跟她的父亲一样。虔诚的信念，无愧于上帝的纯洁，她的良心与爱情，使她耐心忍受父亲的愤怒与谴责。

但是一宗深刻的痛苦压倒了一切其余的痛苦。——她的母亲一天不如一天了。多么慈祥温柔的人，灵魂发出垂死的光辉，反而显出了她的美。欧也妮常常责备自己无形中促成了母亲的病，慢慢在折磨她的残酷的病。这种悔恨，虽经过了母亲的譬解，使她跟自己的爱情越发分不开。每天早上，父亲一出门，她便来到母亲床前，拿侬把早点端给她。但是可怜的欧也妮，为了母亲的痛苦而痛苦，暗中示意拿侬看看母亲的脸色，然后她哭了，不敢提到堂兄弟。倒是母亲先开口：

“他在哪儿呀？怎么没有信来？”

母女俩都不知道路程的远近。

“我们心里想他就是了，”欧也妮回答，“别提他。你在受难，你比一切都要紧。”

所谓一切，便是指他。

“哎，告诉你们，”葛朗台太太常常说，“我对生命没有一点儿留恋。上帝保佑我，使我看到苦难完了的日子只觉得高兴。”

这女人的说话老是虔诚圣洁，显出基督徒的本色。在那年最初几个月之内，当丈夫到她房里踱来踱去用午餐的时候，她翻来覆去地对他说着一篇同样的话，虽然说得极其温柔，却也极其坚决，因为知道自己不久人世，所以反而有了平时没有的勇气。他极平淡地问了她一句身体怎样，她总是回答说：

“谢谢你关心我的病；我是不久的了，要是你肯把我的苦恼减轻一些，把我的悲痛去掉一些，请你饶了女儿吧；希望你以身作则，表示你是基督徒，是贤夫，是慈父。”

一听到这些话，葛朗台便坐在床边，仿佛一个人看见阵雨将临而安安静静躲在门洞里避雨的神气。他静静地听着，一言不答。要是太太用最动人、最温柔、最虔诚的话恳求他，他便说：

“你今天脸色不大好啊，可怜的太太。”

他脑门硬绷绷的，咬紧了嘴唇，表示他已经把女儿忘得干干净净。甚至他那一成不变的，支吾其词的答话使妻子惨白的脸上流满了泪，他也不动心。

“但愿上帝原谅你，老爷，”她说，“像我原谅你一样。有朝一日，你也得求上帝开恩的。”

自从妻子病后，他不敢再叫出那骇人的咄、咄、咄、咄的声音。这个温柔的天使，面貌的丑恶一天天地消失，脸上映照着精神的美，可是葛朗台专制的淫威并没因之软化。

她只剩下一个赤裸裸的灵魂了。由于祷告的力量，脸上最粗俗的线条都似乎净化，变得细腻，有了光彩。有些圣洁的脸庞，灵魂的活动会改变生得最丑的相貌，思想的崇高纯洁，会印上特别生动的气息：这种脱胎换骨的现象大概谁都见识过。在这位女子身上，痛苦把肉体煎熬完了以后换了一副相貌的景象，对心如铁石的老箍桶匠也有了作用，虽是极微弱的作用。他说话不再盛气凌人，却老是不出一声，用静默来保全他做家长的面子。

他的忠心的拿侬一到菜市上，立刻就有对她主人开玩笑或者谴责的话传到她耳里。虽然公众的舆论一致讨伐葛朗台，女仆为了替家里争面子，还在替他辩护。

“嗨，”她回答那些说葛朗台坏话的人，“咱们老起来，不是心肠都要硬一点儿吗？为什么他就不可以？你们别胡说八道。小姐日子过得挺舒服，像王后一样呢。她不见客，那是她自己喜欢。再说，我东家自有道理。”

葛朗台太太给苦恼折磨得比疾病还难受，尽管祷告也没法把父女俩劝和，终于在暮春时节的某天晚上，她把心中的隐痛告诉了两位克罗旭。

“罚一个二十三岁的女儿吃冷水面包！……”特·篷风所长嚷道，“而且毫无理由；这是妨害自由，侵害身体，虐待家属，她可以控告，第一点……”

“哎，哎，老侄，”公证人插嘴道，“说那些法庭上的调调儿干吗？——太太，你放心，我明天就来想法，把软禁的事结束。”

听见人家讲起她的事，欧也妮走出卧房，很高傲地说：

“诸位先生，请你们不要管这件事。我父亲是一家之主。只要我住在他家里，我就得服从他。他的行为用不到大家赞成或反对，他只向上帝负责。我要求你们的友谊是绝口不提这件事。责备我的父亲，等于侮辱我们。诸位，你们对我的关切，我很感激；可是我更感激，要是你们肯阻止城里那些难听的闲话，那是我偶然知道的。”

“她说得有理。”葛朗台太太补上一句。

欧也妮因幽居、悲伤与相思而增添的美，把老公证人看呆了，不觉肃然起敬地答道：

“小姐，阻止流言最好的办法，便是恢复你的自由。”

“好吧，孩子，这件事交给克罗旭先生去办吧，既然他有把握。他识得你父亲的脾气，知道怎么对付他。我没有几天好活了，要是你愿意我最后的日子过得快活一些，无论如何你得跟你父亲讲和。”

下一天，照葛朗台把欧也妮软禁以后的习惯，他到小园里来绕几个圈子。他散步的时间总是欧也妮梳头的时间。老头儿一走到大胡桃树旁边，便躲在树干背后，把女儿的长头发打量一会儿，这时他的心大概就在固执的性子与想去亲吻女儿的欲望中间摇摆不定。他往往坐在查理与欧也妮海誓山盟的那条破凳上，而欧也妮也在偷偷地，或者在镜子里看父亲。要是他起身继续散步，她便凑趣地坐在窗前瞧着围墙，墙上挂着最美丽的花，裂缝中间透出仙女萝，昼颜花，和一株肥肥的、又黄又白的景天草，在索漠和都尔各地的葡萄藤中最常见的植物。

克罗旭公证人很早就来了，发现老头儿在晴好的六月天坐在小凳上，背靠了墙望着女儿。

“有什么事好替你效劳呢，公证人？”他招呼客人。

“我来跟你谈正经。”

“啊！啊！有什么金洋换给我吗？”

“不，不，不关钱的事，是令爱欧也妮的问题。为了你和她，大家都在议论纷纷。”

“他们管得着？区区煤炭匠，也是个家长。”

“对啊，煤炭匠在家里什么都能做，他可以自杀，或者更进一步，把钱往窗外扔。”

“你这是什么意思？”

“哎！你太太的病不轻呀，朋友。你该请裴日冷先生来瞧一瞧，她有性命之忧哪。不好好地把她医治，她死后我相信你不会安心的。”

“咄，咄，咄，咄！你知道我女人闹什么病呀。那些医生一朝踏进了你家大门，一天会来五六次。”

“得啦，葛朗台，随你。咱们是老朋友；你的事，索漠城里没有一个人比我更关切，所以我应当告诉你。好吧，反正没多大关系，你又不是一个孩子，自然知道怎样做人，不用提啦。而且我也不是为这件事来的。还有些别的事情恐怕对你严重多哩。到底你也不想把太太害死吧，她对你太有用了。要是葛朗台太太不在了，你在女儿面前处的什么地位，你想想吧。你应当向欧也妮报账，因为你们夫妇的财产没有分过。你的女儿有权利要求分家，叫你把法劳丰卖掉。总而言之，她承继她的母亲，你不能承继你的太太。”

这些话对好家伙宛如晴天霹雳，他在法律上就不像生意上那么内行。他从没想到共有财产的拍卖。

“所以我劝你对女儿宽和一点儿。”克罗旭末了又说。

“可是你知道她做的什么事吗，克罗旭？”

“什么事？”公证人很高兴听听葛朗台的心腹话，好知道这次吵架的原因。

“她把她的金子送了人。”

“那不是她的东西吗？”公证人问。

“哎，他们说的都是一样的话！”老头儿做了一个悲壮的姿势，把手臂掉了下去。

“难道为了芝麻大的事，”公证人接着说，“你就不想在太太死后，要求女儿放弃权利吗？”

“嘿！你把六千法郎的金洋叫作芝麻大的事？”

“哎！老朋友，把太太的遗产编造清册，分起家来，要是欧也妮这样主张的话，你得破费多少，你知道没有？”

“怎么呢？”

“二十万，三十万，四十万法郎都说不定！为了要知道实际的财产价值，不是要把共有财产拍卖，变现款吗？倘使你能取得她同意……”

“爷爷的锹子！”老箍桶匠脸孔发白地坐了下来，“慢慢再说吧，克罗旭。”

沉默了一会儿，或者是痛苦地挣扎了一会儿，老头儿瞪着公证人说：

“人生残酷，太痛苦了。”他又换了庄严的口吻，“克罗旭，你不会骗我吧，你得发誓刚才你说的那一套都是根据法律的。把民法给我看，我要看民法！”

“朋友，我自己的本行还不清楚吗？”

“那么是真的了？我就得给女儿抢光，欺骗，杀死，吞掉的了。”

“她承继她的母亲哪。”

“那么养儿女有什么用？啊！我的太太，我是爱她的。幸亏她硬朗得很：她是拉·斐德里埃家里的种。”

“她活不了一个月了。”

老箍桶匠敲着自己的脑袋，走过去，走回来，射出一道可怕的目光盯着克罗旭，问道：

“怎么办？”

“欧也妮可以把母亲的遗产无条件地抛弃。你总不愿意剥夺她的承继权吧，你？既然要她做这种让步，就不能亏待她。朋友，我告诉你这些，都是对我自己不利的。我靠的是什么，嗯？……不是清算，登记，拍卖，分家等等吗？”

“慢慢瞧吧，慢慢瞧吧。不谈这些了，克罗旭。你把我的肠子都搅乱了。你收到什么金子没有？”

“没有；可是有十来块古钱，可以让给你。好朋友，跟欧也妮讲和了吧。你瞧，全索漠都对你丢石子呢。”

“那些浑蛋！”

“得啦，公债涨到九十九法郎哪。人生一世总该满意一次吧。”

“九十九，克罗旭？”

“是啊。”

“嗨！嗨！九十九！”老头儿说着把老公证人一直送到街门。

然后，刚才听到的一篇话使他心中七上八下的，在家里待不住了，上楼对妻子说：

“喂，妈妈，你可以跟你女儿混一天了，我上法劳丰去。你们都乖乖的啊。今天是咱们的结婚纪念日，好太太：这儿是十块钱给你在圣体节做路祭用。你不是想了好久吗？得啦，你玩儿吧！你们就乐一下，痛快一下吧，你得保重身体。噢，我多开心噢！”

他把十块六法郎的银币丢在女人床上，捧着她的头吻她的前额。

“好太太，你好一些了，是不是？”

“你心中连女儿都容不下，怎么能在家里接待大慈大悲的上帝呢？”她激动地说。

“咄，咄，咄，咄！”他的声音变得柔和婉转了，“慢慢瞧吧。”

“谢天谢地！欧也妮，快来拥抱你父亲，”她快活的脸孔通红地叫着，“他饶了你啦！”

可是老头儿已经不见了。他连奔带跑地赶到庄园上，急于要把他搅乱了的思想整理一下。那时葛朗台刚刚跨到七十六个年头。两年以来，他更加吝啬了，正如一个人一切年深月久的痴情与癖好一样。根据观察的结果，凡是吝啬鬼，野心家，所有执着一念的人，他们的感情总特别灌注在象征他们痴情的某一件东西上面。看到金子，占有金子，便是葛朗台的执着狂。他专制的程度也随着吝啬而增长；妻子死后要把财产放手一部分，哪怕是极小极小的一部分，只要他管不着，他就觉得逆情悖理。怎么！要对女儿报告财产的数目，把动产不动产一股脑儿登记起来拍卖？……

“那简直是抹自己的脖子。”他在庄园里检视着葡萄藤，高声对自己说。

终于他主意拿定了，晚饭时分回到索漠，决意向欧也妮屈服，巴结她，诱哄她，以便到死都能保持家长的威风，抓着几百万家财的大权，直到咽最后一口气为止。老头儿无意中身边带着百宝钥匙，便自己开了大门，轻手蹑脚地上楼到妻子房里，那时欧也妮正捧了那口精美的梳妆箱放在母亲床上。趁葛朗台不在家，母女俩很高兴地在查理母亲的肖像上咂摸一下查理的面貌。

“这明明是他的额角，他的嘴！”老头儿开门进去，欧也妮正这么说着。

一看见丈夫瞪着金子的眼光，葛朗台太太便叫起来：“上帝呀，救救我们！”

老头儿身子一纵，扑上梳妆匣，好似一头老虎扑上一个睡着的婴儿。

“什么东西？”他拿着宝匣往窗前走去。“噢，是真金！金子！”他连声叫嚷，“这么多的金子！有两斤重。啊！啊！查理把这个跟你换了美丽的金洋，是不是？为什么不早告诉我？这交易划得来，小乖乖！你真是我的女儿，我明白了。”

欧也妮四肢发抖。老头儿接着说：

“不是吗，这是查理的东西？”

“是的，父亲，不是我的。这匣子是神圣不可侵犯的，是寄存的东西。”

“咄，咄，咄，咄！他拿了你的家私，正应该补偿你。”

“父亲……”

好家伙想掏出刀子撬一块金板下来，先把匣子往椅上一放。欧也妮扑过去想抢回；可是箍桶匠的眼睛老盯着女儿跟梳妆匣，他手臂一摆，使劲一推，她便倒在母亲床上。

“老爷！老爷！”母亲嚷着，在床上直坐起来。

葛朗台拔出刀子预备撬了。欧也妮立刻跪下，爬到父亲身旁，高举着两手，嚷道：

“父亲，父亲，看在圣母面上，看在十字架上的基督面上，看在所有的圣灵面上，看在你灵魂得救面上，看在我的性命面上，你不要动它！这口梳妆匣不是你的，也不是我的，是一个受难的亲属的，他托我保管，我得原封不动地还他。”

“为什么拿来看呢，要是寄存的话？看比动手更要不得。”

“父亲，不能动呀，你叫我见不得人啦！父亲，听见没有？”

“老爷，求你！”母亲跟着说。

“父亲！”欧也妮大叫一声，吓得拿侬也赶到了楼上。

欧也妮在手边抓到了一把刀子，当作武器。

“怎么样？”葛朗台冷笑着，静静地说。

“老爷，老爷，你要我命了！”母亲嚷着。

“父亲，你的刀把金子碰掉一点儿，我就把这刀结果我性命。你已经把母亲害到只剩一口气，你还要杀死你的女儿。好吧，大家拼掉算了！”

葛朗台把刀子对着梳妆匣，望着女儿，迟疑不决。

“你敢吗，欧也妮？”他说。

“她会的，老爷。”母亲说。

“她说得到做得到，”拿侬嚷道，“先生，你一生一世总得讲一次理吧。”

箍桶匠看看金子，看看女儿，愣了一会儿。葛朗台太太晕过去了。

“哎，先生，你瞧，太太死过去了！”拿侬嚷道。

“哦，孩子，咱们别为了一口箱子生气啦。拿去吧！”箍桶匠马上把梳妆匣扔在了床上。“——拿侬，你去请裴日冷先生。——得啦，太太，”他吻着妻子的手，“没有事啦，咱们讲和啦。——不是吗，小乖乖？不吃干面包了，爱吃什么就吃什么吧……啊！她眼睛睁开了。——啊！她眼睛睁开了。——哎哎，妈妈，小妈妈，好妈妈，得啦！哎，你瞧我拥抱欧也妮了。她爱她的堂兄弟，她要嫁给他就嫁给他吧，让她把小箱子藏起来吧。可是你得长命百岁地活下去啊，可怜的太太。哎哎，你身子动一下给我看哪！告诉你，圣体节你可以拿出最体面的祭桌，索漠从来没有过的祭桌。”

“天哪，你怎么可以这样对你的妻子跟孩子！”葛朗台太太的声音很微弱。

“下次绝不了，绝不了！”箍桶匠叫着，“你瞧就是，可怜的太太。”

他到密室去拿了一把路易来摔在床上。

“喂，欧也妮，喂，太太，这是给你们的，”他一边说一边把钱拈着玩，“哎哎，太太，你开开心；快快好起来吧，你要什么有什么，欧也妮也是的。瞧，这一百金路易是给她的。你不会把这些再送人了吧，欧也妮，是不是？”

葛朗台太太和女儿面面相觑，莫名其妙。

“父亲，把钱收起来吧，我们只需要你的感情。”

“对啦，这才对啦，”他把金路易装进口袋，“咱们和和气气过日子吧。大家下楼，到堂屋去吃晚饭，天天晚上来两个铜子的摸彩。你们痛快玩吧，嗯，太太，好不好？”

“唉！怎么不好，既然这样你觉得快活，”奄奄一息的病人回答，“可是我起不来啊。”

“可怜的妈妈，”箍桶匠说，“你不知道我多爱你。——还有你，我的女儿！”

他搂着她，把她拥抱。

“噢！吵过了架再搂着女儿多开心，小乖乖！……嗨，你瞧，小妈妈，现在咱们两个变了一个了。”他又指着梳妆盒对欧也妮说，“把这个藏起来吧。去吧，不用怕。我再也不提了，永远不提了。”

不久，索漠最有名的医生裴日冷先生来了。诊察完毕，他老实告诉葛朗台，说他太太病得厉害，只有给她精神上绝对安静，悉心调养，服侍周到，可能拖到秋末。

“要不要花很多的钱？要不要吃药呢？”

“不用多少药，调养要紧。”医生不由得微微一笑。

“哎，裴日冷先生，你是有地位的人。我完全相信你，你认为什么时候应该来看她，尽管来，求你救救我的女人；我多爱她，虽然表面上看不出，因为我家里什么都藏在骨子里的，那些事把我心都搅乱了。我有我的伤心事。兄弟一死，伤心事就进了我的门，我为他在巴黎花钱……花了数不清的钱！而且还没得完。再会吧，先生。要是我女人还有救，请你救救她，即使要我一百两百法郎也行。”

虽然葛朗台热烈盼望太太病好，因为她一死就得办遗产登记，而这就要了他的命；虽然他对母女俩百依百顺，一心讨好的态度使她们出惊；虽然欧也妮竭尽孝心地侍奉；葛朗台太太还是很快地往死路上走。像所有在这年纪上得了重病的女人一样，她一天憔悴一天。她像秋天的树叶一般脆弱。天国的光辉照着她，仿佛太阳照着树叶发出金光。有她那样的一生，才有她那样的死，恬退隐忍，完全是一个基督徒的死，死得崇高，伟大。

到了一八二二年十月，她的贤德，她的天使般的耐心和对女儿的怜爱，表现得格外显著；她没有一句怨言地死了，像洁白的羔羊一般上了天。在这个世界上她只舍不得一个人，她凄凉的一生的温柔的伴侣——她最后的几眼似乎暗示女儿将来的苦命。想到把这头和她自己一样洁白的羔羊，孤零零地留在自私自利的世界上任人宰割，她就发抖。

“孩子，”她断气以前对她说，“幸福只有在天上，你将来会知道。”

下一天早上，欧也妮更有一些新的理由，觉得和她出生的、受过多少痛苦的、母亲刚在里面咽气的这所屋子分不开。她望着堂屋里的窗棂与草垫的椅子不能不落泪。她以为错看了老父的心，因为他对她多么温柔多么体贴：他来搀了她去用午饭，几小时地望着她，眼睛的神气差不多是慈祥了；他瞅着女儿，仿佛她是金铸的一般。

老箍桶匠变得厉害，常在女儿前面哆嗦，眼见他这种老态的拿侬与克罗旭他们，认为是他年纪太大的缘故，甚至担心他有些器官已经衰退。可是到了全家戴孝那天，吃过了晚饭，当唯一知道这老人秘密的公证人在座的时候，老头儿古怪的行为就有了答案。

饭桌收拾完了，门都关严了，他对欧也妮说：

“好孩子，现在你承继了你母亲啦，咱们中间可有些小小的事得办一办。——对不对，克罗旭？”

“对。”

“难道非赶在今天办不行吗，父亲？”

“是呀，是呀，小乖乖。我不能让事情搁在那儿牵肠挂肚。你总不至于要我受罪吧。”

“噢！父亲……”

“好吧，那么今天晚上一切都得办了。”

“你要我干什么呢？”

“乖乖，这可不关我的事。——克罗旭，你告诉她吧。”

“小姐，令尊既不愿意把产业分开，也不愿意出卖，更不愿因为变卖财产，有了现款而付大笔的捐税，所以你跟令尊共有的财产，你得放弃登记……”

“克罗旭，你这些话保险没有错吗，可以对一个孩子说吗？”

“让我说呀，葛朗台。”

“好，好，朋友。你跟我的女儿都不会抢我的家私。——对不对，小乖乖？”

“可是，克罗旭先生，究竟要我干什么呢？”欧也妮不耐烦地问。

“哦，你得在这张文书上签个字，表示你抛弃对令堂财产的继承权，把你跟令尊共有的财产，全部交给令尊管理，收入归他，光给你保留虚有权……”

“你对我说的，我一点儿不明白，”欧也妮回答，“把文书给我，告诉我签字应该签在哪儿。”

葛朗台老头的眼睛从文书转到女儿，从女儿转到文书，紧张得脑门上尽是汗，一刻不停地抹着。

“小乖乖，这张文书送去备案的时候要花很多钱，要是对你可怜的母亲，你肯无条件抛弃继承权，把你的前途完全交托给我的话，我觉得更满意。我按月付你一百法郎的大利钱。这样，你爱做多少台弥撒给谁都可以了！……嗯！按月一百法郎，一块钱作六法郎，行吗？”

“你爱怎么办就怎么办吧，父亲。”

“小姐，”公证人说，“以我的责任，应当告诉你，这样你自己是一无所有了……”

“嗨！上帝，”她回答，“那有什么关系！”

“别多嘴，克罗旭。——一言为定，”葛朗台抓起女儿的手放在自己手中一拍，“欧也妮，你绝不翻悔，你是有信用的姑娘，是不是？”

“噢！父亲……”

他热烈地拥抱着她，把她紧紧地搂得几乎喘不过气来。

“得啦，孩子，你给了我生路，我有了命啦，不过这是你把欠我的还了我：咱们两讫了。这才叫作公平交易。人生就是一件交易。我祝福你！你是一个贤德的姑娘，孝顺爸爸的姑娘。你现在爱做什么都可以。”

“明儿见，克罗旭，”他望着骇呆了的公证人说，“请你招呼法院书记官预备一份抛弃文书，麻烦你给照顾一下。”

下一天中午时分，声明书签了字，欧也妮自动地抛弃了财产。

可是到第一年年终，老箍桶匠庄严地许给女儿的一百法郎月费，连一个子儿都没有给。欧也妮说笑之间提到的时候，他不由得脸上一红，奔进密室，把他从侄儿那里三钱不值两文买来的金饰，捧了三分之一下来。

“哎，孩子，”他的语调很有点儿挖苦意味，“要不要把这些抵充你的一千二百法郎？”

“噢，父亲，真的吗，你把这些给我？”

“明年我再给你这么些，”他说着把金饰倒在她围裙兜里，“这样，不用多少时候，他的首饰都到你手里了。”他搓着手，因为能够利用女儿的感情占了便宜，觉得很高兴。

话虽如此，老头儿尽管还硬朗，也觉得需要让女儿学一学管家的诀窍了。连着两年，他教欧也妮当他的面吩咐饭菜，收人家的欠账。他慢慢地，把庄园田地的名称内容，陆续告诉她。第三年上，他的吝啬作风把女儿训练成熟，变成了习惯，于是他放心大胆地，把伙食房的钥匙交给她，让她正式当家。

五年这样地过去了，在欧也妮父女单调的生活中无事可述，老是些同样的事情，做得像一座老钟那样准确。葛朗台小姐的愁闷忧苦已经是公开的秘密，但是尽管大家感觉到她忧苦的原因，她从没说过一句话，给索漠人对她感情的猜想有所证实。她唯一来往的人，只有几位克罗旭与他们无意中带来走熟的一些朋友。他们教会了她打韦斯脱牌，每天晚上都来玩一局。

一八二七那一年，她的父亲感到衰老的压迫，不得不让女儿参与田产的秘密，遇到什么难题，就叫她跟克罗旭公证人商量——他的忠实，老头儿是深信不疑的。然后，到这一年年终，在八十二岁上，好家伙患了风瘫，很快地加重。裴日冷先生断定他的病是不治的了。

想到自己不久就要一个人在世界上了，欧也妮便跟父亲格外接近，把这感情的最后一环握得更紧。像一切动了爱情的女子一样，在她心目中，爱情便是整个的世界，可是查理不在眼前。她对老父的照顾服侍，可以说是鞠躬尽瘁。他开始显得老态龙钟，可是守财奴的脾气依旧由本能支持在那里。所以这个人从生到死没有一点儿改变。

从清早起，他叫人家把他的转椅，在卧室的壁炉与密室的门中间推来推去，密室里头不用说是堆满了金子的。他一动不动地待在那儿，极不放心地把看他的人，和装了铁皮的门，轮流瞧着。听到一点儿响动，他就要人家报告原委；而且使公证人大为吃惊的是，他连狗在院子里打呵欠都听得见。他好像迷迷糊糊的神志不清，可是一到人家该送田租来，跟管庄园的算账，或者出立收据的日子与时间，他会立刻清醒。于是他推动转椅，直到密室门口。他叫女儿把门打开，监督她亲自把一袋袋的钱秘密地堆好，把门关严。然后他又一声不出地回到原来的位置，只要女儿把那个宝贵的钥匙交还了他，藏在背心袋里，不时用手摸一下。他的老朋友公证人，觉得倘使查理·葛朗台不回来，这个有钱的独养女儿稳是嫁给他当所长的侄儿的了，所以他招呼得加倍殷勤，天天来听葛朗台差遣，奉命到法劳丰，到各处的田地、草原、葡萄园去，代葛朗台卖掉收成，把暗中积在密室里的成袋的钱，兑成金子。

末了，终于到了弥留时期，那几日老头儿结实的身子进入了毁灭的阶段。他要坐在火炉旁边，密室之前。他把身上的被一齐拉紧，裹紧，嘴里对拿侬说着：

“裹紧，裹紧，别给人家偷了我的东西。”

他所有的生命力都退守在眼睛里了，他能够睁开眼的时候，立刻转到满屋财宝的密室门上：

“在那里吗？在那里吗？”问话的声音显出他惊慌得厉害。

“在那里呢，父亲。”

“你看住金子！……拿来放在我面前！”

欧也妮把金路易铺在桌上，他几小时地用眼睛盯着，好像一个才知道观看的孩子呆望着同一件东西；也像孩子一般，他露出一点儿很吃力的笑意。有时他说一句：

“这样好叫我心里暖和！”脸上的表情仿佛进了极乐世界。

本区的教士来给他做临终法事的时候，十字架、烛台和银镶的圣水壶一出现，似乎已经死去几小时的眼睛立刻复活了，目不转睛地瞧着那些法器，他的肉瘤也最后地动了一动。神父把镀金的十字架送到他唇边，给他亲吻基督的圣像，他却做了一个骇人的姿势想把十字架抓在手里，这一下最后的努力送了他的命。他唤着欧也妮，欧也妮跪在前面，流着泪吻着他已经冰冷的手，可是他看不见。

“父亲，祝福我啊。”

“把一切照顾得好好的！到那边来向我交账！”这最后一句证明基督教应该是守财奴的宗教。

于是欧也妮在这座屋子里完全孤独了；只有拿侬，主人对她递一个眼神就会懂得，只有拿侬为爱她而爱她，只有跟拿侬才能谈谈心中的悲苦。为欧也妮，拿侬简直是一个保护人，她不再是一个女仆，而是卑恭的朋友。

父亲死后，欧也妮从克罗旭公证人那里知道，她在索漠地界的田产每年有三十万法郎收入；有六十法郎买进的三厘公债六百万，现在已经涨到每股七十七法郎；还有价值二百万的金子，十万现款，其他零星的收入还不计在内。她财产的总值大概有一千七百万。

“可是堂兄弟在哪里啊？”她咕哝着。

克罗旭公证人把遗产清册交给欧也妮的那天，她和拿侬两个在壁炉架两旁各据一方地坐着，在这间空荡荡的堂屋内，一切都是回忆，从母亲坐惯的草垫椅子起，到堂兄弟喝过的玻璃杯为止。

“拿侬，我们孤独了！”

“是的，小姐；哎，要是我知道他在哪里，我会走着去把他找来，这俏冤家。”

“汪洋大海隔着我们呢。”

正当可怜的承继人，在这所包括了她整个天地的又冷又暗的屋里，跟老女仆两个相对饮泣的时候，从南德到奥莱昂，大家议论纷纷，只谈着葛朗台小姐的一千七百万家私。她的第一批行事中间，一桩便是给了拿侬一千二百法郎终身年金。拿侬原来有六百法郎，加上这一笔，立刻变成一门有陪嫁的好亲事。不到一个月，她从闺女一变而为人家的媳妇，嫁给替葛朗台小姐看守田地产业的安东纳·高诺阿莱了。高诺阿莱太太比当时旁的妇女占很大的便宜。五十九岁的年纪看上去不超过四十。粗糙的线条不怕时间的侵蚀。一向过着修道院式的生活，她的鲜红的皮色，铁一般硬棒的身体，根本不知衰老为何物。也许她从没有结婚那天好看过。生得丑倒是沾了光，她高大，肥胖，结实；毫不见老的脸上，有一股幸福的神气，叫有些人羡慕高诺阿莱的福分。

“她气色很好。”那个开布店的说。

“她还能够生孩子呢，”盐商说，“说句你不爱听的话，她好像在盐卤里腌过，不会坏的。”

“她很有钱，高诺阿莱这小子眼力倒不错。”另外一个街坊说。

人缘很好的拿侬从老屋里出来，走下弯弯曲曲的街，上教堂去的时候，一路受到人家祝贺。

欧也妮送的贺礼是三打餐具。高诺阿莱想不到主人这样慷慨，一提到小姐便流眼泪：他甚至肯为她丢掉脑袋。成为欧也妮的心腹之后，高诺阿莱太太在嫁了丈夫的快乐以外，又添了一桩快乐：因为终于轮到她来把伙食房打开，关上，早晨去分配粮食，好似她去世的老主人一样。其次，归她调度的还有两名仆役，一个是厨娘，一个是收拾屋子、修补衣裳被服、缝制小姐衣衫的女仆。高诺阿莱兼做看守与总管。不消说，拿侬挑选来的厨娘与女仆都是上选之才。这样，葛朗台小姐有了四个忠心的仆役。老头儿生前管理田产的办法早已成为老例章程，现在再由高诺阿莱夫妇小心翼翼地继续下去，那些庄稼人简直不觉得老主人已经去世。

如此人生


到了三十岁，欧也妮还没有尝到一点儿人生乐趣。黯淡凄凉的童年，是在一个有了好心而无人识得、老受欺侮而永远痛苦的母亲身旁度过的。这位离开世界只觉得快乐的母亲，曾经为了女儿还得活下去而发愁，使欧也妮心中老觉得有些对不起她，永远地悼念她。欧也妮第一次也是仅有的一次爱情，成为她痛苦的根源。情人只看见了几天，她就在匆忙中接受了而回敬了的亲吻中间，把心给了他；然后他走了，整个世界把她和他隔开了。这场被父亲诅咒的爱情，差不多送了母亲的命，她得到的只有苦恼与一些渺茫的希望。所以至此为止，她为了追求幸福而消耗了自己的精力，却没有地方好去补充她的精力。精神生活与肉体生活一样，有呼也有吸：灵魂要吸收另一颗灵魂的感情来充实自己，然后以更丰富的感情送回给人家。人与人之间要没有这点美妙的关系，心就没有了生机：它缺少空气，它会受难，枯萎。

欧也妮开始痛苦了。为她，财富既不是一种势力，也不是一种安慰；她只能靠了爱情，靠了宗教，靠了对前途的信心而生活。爱情给她解释了永恒。她的心与福音书，告诉她将来还有两个世界好等。她日夜沉浸在两种无穷的思想中，而这两种思想，在她也许只是一种。她把整个的生命收敛起来，只知道爱，只知道被人爱。七年以来，她的热情席卷一切。她的宝物并非收益日增的千万家私，而是查理的那口匣子，而是挂在床头的两张肖像，而是向父亲赎回来、放在棉花上、藏在旧木柜抽斗中的金饰，还有母亲用过的叔母的针箍。单单为了要把这满是回忆的金顶针套在手指上，她每天都得诚诚心心地戴了它做一点儿绣作——正如潘奈洛泼等待丈夫回家的活计。

看光景葛朗台小姐绝不会在守丧期间结婚。大家知道她的虔诚是出于真心。所以克罗旭一家在老神父高明的指挥之下，光是用殷勤恳切的照顾来包围有钱的姑娘。

她堂屋里每天晚上都是高朋满座，都是当地最热烈最忠心的克罗旭党，竭力用各种不同的语调颂赞主妇。她有随从御医，有大司祭，有内廷供奉，有侍候梳洗的贵嫔，有首相，特别是枢密大臣，那个无所不言的枢密大臣。如果她想有一个替她牵裳曳袂的侍从，人家也会替她找来的。她简直是一个王后，人家对她的谄媚，比对所有的王后更巧妙。谄媚从来不会出自伟大的心灵，而是小人的伎俩，他们卑躬屈膝，把自己尽量地缩小，以便钻进他们趋附的人物的生活核心。而且谄媚背后有利害关系。所以那些每天晚上挤在这儿的人，把葛朗台小姐唤作特·法劳丰小姐，居然把她捧上了。这些众口一词的恭维，欧也妮是闻所未闻的，最初不免脸红；但不论奉承的话如何过火，她的耳朵不知不觉也把称赞她如何美丽的话听惯了，倘使此刻还有什么新来的客人觉得她丑陋，她绝不能再像八年前那样满不在乎。而且临了，她在膜拜情人的时候暗中说的那套甜言蜜语，她自己也爱听了。因此她慢慢地听任人家夜夜来上朝似的，把她捧得像王后一般。

特·篷风所长是这个小圈子里的男主角，他的才气，人品，学问，和蔼，老是有人在那儿吹捧。有的说七年来他的财产增加了不少：篷风那块产业至少有一万法郎收入，而且和克罗旭家所有的田产一样，周围便是葛朗台小姐广大的产业。

“你知道吗，小姐，”另外一个熟客说，“克罗旭他们有四万法郎收入！”

“还有他们的积蓄呢，”克罗旭党里的一个老姑娘，特·格里鲍果小姐接着说，“最近巴黎来了一位先生，愿意把他的事务所以二十万法郎的代价盘给克罗旭。这位巴黎人要是谋到了乡镇推事的位置，就得把事务所出盘。”

“他想填补特·篷风先生当所长呢，所以先来布置一番，”特·奥松华太太插嘴说，“因为所长先生不久要升高等法院推事，再升庭长；他办法多得很，保险成功。”

“是啊，”另外一个接住了话头，“他真是一个人才，小姐，你看是不是？”

所长先生竭力把自己收拾得和他想扮演的角色配合。虽然年纪已有四十，虽然那张硬绷绷的暗黄脸，像所有司法界人士的脸一样干瘪，他还装作年轻人模样，拿着藤杖满嘴胡扯，在特·法劳丰小姐府上从来不吸鼻烟，老戴着白领带，领下的大折裥颈围，使他的神气很像跟一班蠢头蠢脑的家伙是同门弟兄。他对美丽的姑娘说话的态度很亲密，把她叫作“我们亲爱的欧也妮”。

总之，除了客人的数目，除了摸彩变成韦斯脱，再除去了葛朗台夫妇两个，堂屋里晚会的场面和过去并没有什么两样。那群猎犬永远在追逐欧也妮和她的千百万家私，但是猎狗的数量增多了，叫也叫得更巧妙，而且是同心协力地包围它们的俘虏。要是查理忽然从印度跑回来，他可以发现同样的人物与同样的利害冲突。欧也妮依旧招待得很客气的台·格拉桑太太，始终跟克罗旭他们捣乱。可是跟从前一样，控制这个场面的还是欧也妮；也跟从前一样，查理在这儿还是高于一切。但情形究竟有了些进步。从前所长送给欧也妮生日的鲜花，现在变成经常的了。每天晚上，他给这位有钱的小姐送来一大束富丽堂皇的花，高诺阿莱太太有心当着众人把它插入花瓶，可是客人一转背，马上给暗暗地扔在院子角落里。

初春的时候，台·格拉桑太太又来破坏克罗旭党的幸福了，她向欧也妮提起特·法劳丰侯爵，说要是欧也妮肯嫁给他，在订立婚书的时候，把他以前的产业带回过去的话，他立刻可以重振家业。台·格拉桑太太把贵族的门第、侯爵夫人的头衔叫得震天价响，把欧也妮轻蔑的微笑当作同意的暗示，到处扬言，克罗旭所长先生的婚事不见得像他所想的那么成熟。

“虽然特·法劳丰先生已经五十岁，”她说，“看起来也不比克罗旭先生老；不错，他是鳏夫，他有孩子，可是他是侯爵，将来又是贵族院议员，嘿！在这个年月，你找得出这样的亲事来吗？我确确实实知道，葛朗台老头当初把所有的田产并入法劳丰，就是存心要跟法劳丰家接种。他常常对我说的。他狡猾得很呀，这老头儿。”

“怎么，拿侬，”欧也妮有一晚临睡时说，“他一去七年，连一封信都没有！……”

正当这些事情在索漠搬演的时候，查理在印度发了财。先是他那批起码货卖了好价，很快地弄到了六千美金。他一过赤道线，便丢掉了许多成见：发觉在热带地方的致富捷径，像在欧洲一样，是贩卖人口。于是他到非洲海岸去做黑人买卖，同时在他为了求利而去的各口岸间，拣最挣钱的货色贩运。他把全副精神放在生意上，忙得没有一点儿空闲，唯一的念头是发了大财回到巴黎去耀武扬威，爬到比从前一个跟头栽下来的地位更阔的地位。

在人堆中混久了，地方跑多了，看到许多相反的风俗，他的思想变了，对一切都取怀疑态度了。他眼见在一个地方成为罪恶的，在另一个地方竟是美德，于是他对是非曲直再没有一定的观念。一天到晚为利益打算的结果，心变冷了，收缩了，干枯了。葛朗台家的血统没有失传，查理变得狠心刻薄，贪婪到了极点。他贩卖中国人、黑人、燕窝、儿童、艺术家，大规模放高利贷。偷税走私的习惯，使他愈加藐视人权。他到南美洲圣多玛岛上贱价收买海盗的赃物，运到缺货的地方去卖。

初次出国的航程中，他心头还有欧也妮高尚纯洁的面貌，好似西班牙水手把圣母像挂在船上一样；生意上初期的成功，他还归功于这个温柔的姑娘的祝福与祈祷；可是后来，黑种女人，白种女人，黑白混血种女人，爪哇女人，埃及舞女……跟各种颜色的女子花天酒地，到处荒唐胡闹过后，把他关于堂姊、索漠、旧屋、凳子、甬道里的亲吻等等的回忆，抹得一干二净。他只记得墙垣破旧的小花园，因为那儿是他冒险生涯的起点；可是他否认他的家属：伯父是头老狗，骗了他的金饰；欧也妮在他心中与脑海中都毫无地位，她只是生意上供给他六千法郎的一个债主。这种行径与这种念头，便是查理·葛朗台杳无音信的原因。在印度、圣多玛、非洲海岸、里斯本、美国，这位投机家为免得牵连本姓起见，取了一个假姓名，叫作卡尔·赛弗。这样，他可以毫无危险地到处胆大妄为了；不择手段，急于捞钱的作风，似乎巴不得把不名誉的勾当早日结束，在后半世做个安分良民。这种办法使他很快地发了大财。一八二七年上，他搭了一家保王党贸易公司的一条华丽帆船，玛丽—加洛琳号，回到波尔多。他有三大桶箍扎严密的金屑子，值到一百九十万法郎，打算到巴黎换成金币，再赚七八厘利息。同船有一位慈祥的老人，查理十世陛下的内廷行走，特·奥勃里翁先生，当初糊里糊涂地娶了一位交际花。他的产业在墨西哥海湾中的众岛上，这次是为了弥补太太的挥霍，到那边去变卖家产的。特·奥勃里翁夫妇是旧世家特·奥勃里翁·特·皮克出身，特·皮克的最后一位将军在一七八九年以前就死了。现在的特·奥勃里翁，一年只有两万法郎左右的进款，还有一个奇丑而没有陪嫁的女儿，因为母亲自己的财产仅仅够住在巴黎的开销。可是交际场中认为，就凭一般时髦太太那样天大的本领，也不容易嫁掉这个女儿。特·奥勃里翁太太自己也看了女儿心焦，巴不得马上送她出去，不问对象，即使是想做贵族想迷了心的男人也行。

特·奥勃里翁小姐与她同音异义的昆虫一样，长得像一只蜻蜓[1]；又瘦又细，嘴巴老是瞧不起人的模样，上面挂着一个太长的鼻子，平常是黄黄的颜色，一吃饭却完全变红，这种植物性的变色现象，在一张又苍白又无聊的脸上格外难看。总而言之，她的模样，正好叫一个年纪三十八而还有风韵还有野心的母亲欢喜。可是为补救那些缺陷起见，特·奥勃里翁侯爵夫人把女儿教得态度非常文雅，经常的卫生把鼻子维持着相当合理的皮色，教她学会打扮得大方，传授她许多漂亮的举动，会做出那些多愁多病的眼神，叫男人看了动心，以为终于遇到了找遍天涯无觅处的安琪儿；她也教女儿如何运用双足，赶上鼻子肆无忌惮发红的辰光，就该应时地伸出脚来，让人家鉴赏它们的纤小玲珑；总之，她把女儿琢磨得着实不错了。靠了宽大的袖子，骗人的胸褡，收拾得齐齐整整而衣袂往四下里鼓起来的长袍[2]，束得极紧的撑裙，她居然制成了一些女性的特征，其巧妙的程度实在应当送进博物馆，给所有的母亲做参考。查理很巴结特·奥勃里翁太太，而她也正想交结他。有好些人竟说在船上的时期，美丽的特·奥勃里翁太太把凡是可以钓上这有钱女婿的手段，件件都做到家了。一八二七年六月，在波尔多下了船，特·奥勃里翁先生、太太、小姐和查理，寄宿在同一个旅馆，又一同上巴黎。特·奥勃里翁的府邸早已抵押出去，要查理给赎回来。丈母已经讲起把楼下一层让给女婿女儿住是多么快活的话。不像特·奥勃里翁先生那样对门第有成见，她已经答应查理·葛朗台，向查理十世请一道上谕，钦准他葛朗台改姓特·奥勃里翁，使用特·奥勃里翁家的爵徽；并且只要查理送一个岁收三万六千法郎的采邑给特·奥勃里翁，他将来便可承袭特·皮克大将军与特·奥勃里翁侯爵的双重头衔。两家的财产合起来，加上国家的干俸，一切安排得好好的话，除了特·奥勃里翁的府邸之外，大概可以有十几万法郎收入。

她对查理说：“一个人有了十万法郎收入，有了姓氏，有了门第，出入宫廷——我会给你弄一个内廷行走的差事——那不是要当什么就当什么了吗？这样，你可以当参事院请愿委员，当州长，当大使馆秘书，当大使，由你挑选就是。查理十世很喜欢特·奥勃里翁，他们从小就相熟。”

这女人挑逗查理的野心，弄得他飘飘然；她手段巧妙的，当作体己话似的，告诉他将来有如何如何的希望，使查理在船上一路想出了神。他以为父亲的事情有伯父料清了，觉得自己可以平步青云，一脚闯入个个人都想挤进去的圣日耳曼区，在玛蒂尔特小姐的蓝鼻子提携之下，他可以摇身一变而为特·奥勃里翁伯爵，好似特孪一家当初一变而为勃莱才一样。他出国的时候，王政复辟还是摇摇欲坠的局面，现在却是繁荣昌盛，把他看得眼花了，贵族思想的光辉把他怔住了，所以他在船上开始的醉意，一直维持到巴黎。到了巴黎，他决心不顾一切，要把自私的丈母娘暗示给他的高官厚爵弄到手。在这个光明的远景中，堂姊自然不过是一个小点子了。

他重新见到了阿纳德。以交际花的算盘，阿纳德极力怂恿她的旧情人攀这门亲，并且答应全力支援他一切野心的活动。阿纳德很高兴查理娶一位又丑又可厌的小姐，因为他在印度逗留过后，出落得更讨人喜欢了：皮肤变成暗黄，举动变成坚决、放肆，好似那些惯于决断、控制、成功的人一样。查理眼看自己可以成个角色，在巴黎更觉得如鱼得水了。

台·格拉桑知道他已经回国，不久就得结婚，并且有了钱，便来看他，告诉他再付三十万法郎便可把他父亲的债务偿清。

他见到查理的时候，正碰上一个珠宝商在那里拿了图样，向查理请示特·奥勃里翁小姐首饰的款式。查理从印度带回的钻石确是富丽堂皇，可是钻石的镶工，新夫妇所用的银器，金银首饰与小玩意儿，还得花二十万法郎以上。查理见了台·格拉桑已经认不得了，态度的傲慢，活现出他是一个时髦青年，曾经在印度跟人家决斗、打死过四个对手的人物。台·格拉桑已经来过三次。查理冷冷地听着，然后，并没把事情完全弄清楚，就回答说：

“我父亲的事不是我的事。谢谢你这样费心，先生，可惜我不能领情。我流了汗挣来不到两百万的钱，不是预备送给我父亲的债主的。”

“要是几天之内人家把令尊宣告了破产呢？”

“先生，几天之内我叫作特·奥勃里翁伯爵了。还跟我有什么相干？而且你比我更清楚，一个有十万法郎收入的人，他的父亲决不会有过破产的事。”他说着，客客气气把台·格拉桑推到门口。

这一年的八月初，欧也妮坐在堂兄弟对她海誓山盟的那条小木凳上，天晴的日子她就在这儿用早点的。这时候，在一个最凉爽最愉快的早晨，可怜的姑娘正在记忆中把她爱情史上的大事小事，以及接着发生的祸事，一件件地想过来。阳光照在那堵美丽的墙上——到处开裂的墙快要坍毁了，高诺阿莱老是跟他女人说早晚要压坏人的，可是古怪的欧也妮始终不许人去碰它一碰。这时邮差来敲门，授了一封信给高诺阿莱太太，她一边嚷一边走进园子：“小姐，有信哪！”

她授给了主人，问：“是不是你天天等着的信呀？”

这句话传到欧也妮心中的声响，其强烈不下于在园子和院子的墙壁中间实际的回声。

“巴黎！……是他的！他回来了。”

欧也妮脸色发白，拿着信愣了一会儿。她抖得太厉害了，简直不能拆信。

长脚拿侬站在那儿，两手叉着腰，快乐在她暗黄脸的沟槽中像一道烟似的溜走了。

“念呀，小姐……”

“啊！拿侬，他从索漠动身的，为什么回巴黎呢？”

“念呀，你念了就知道啦。”

欧也妮哆嗦着拆开信来。里面掉出一张汇票，是向台·格拉桑太太与高莱合伙的索漠银号兑款的，拿侬给捡了起来。

亲爱的堂姊……

——不叫我欧也妮了，她想着，心揪紧了。

您……

———用这种客套的称呼了！

她交叉了手臂，不敢再往下念，大颗的眼泪冒了上来。

“难道他死了吗？”拿侬问。

“那他不会写信了！”欧也妮回答。

于是她把信念下去：

亲爱的堂姊，您知道了我的事业成功，我相信您一定很高兴。您给了我吉利，我居然挣了钱回来。我也听从了伯父的劝告。他和伯母去世的消息，刚由台·格拉桑先生告诉我。父母的死亡是必然之事，我们应当接替他们。希望您现在已经节哀顺变。我觉得什么都抵抗不住时间。是的，亲爱的堂姊，我的幻象，不幸都已过去。有什么办法！走了许多地方，我把人生想过了。动身时是一个孩子，回来变了大人。现在我想到许多以前不曾想过的事。堂姊，您是自由了，我也还是自由的。表面上似乎毫无阻碍，我们尽可实现当初小小的计划；可是我太坦白了，不能把我的处境瞒您。我没有忘记我不能自由行动；在长途的航程中我老是想起那条小凳……

欧也妮仿佛身底下碰到了火炭，猛地站了起来，走去坐在院子里一级石磴上。

……那条小凳，我们坐着发誓永远相爱的小凳；也想起过道，灰色的堂屋，阁楼上我的卧房，也想起那天夜里，您的好意给了我很大的帮助。是的，这些回忆支持了我的勇气，我常常想，您一定在我们约定的时间想念我，正如我想念您一样。您有没有在九点钟看云呢？看的，是不是？所以我不愿欺骗我认为神圣的友谊，不，我绝对不应该欺骗您。此刻有一门亲事，完全符合我对于结婚的观念。在婚姻中谈爱情是做梦。现在，经验告诉我，结婚这件事应当服从一切社会的规律，适应风俗习惯的要求。而你我之间第一先有了年龄的差别，将来对于您也许比对我更有影响。更不用提您的生活方式，您的教育，您的习惯，都与巴黎生活格格不入，决计不能配合我以后的方针。我的计划是维持一个场面阔绰的家，招待许多客人，而我记得您是喜欢安静恬淡的生活的。不，我要更坦白些，请您把我的处境仲裁一下吧；您也应当知道我的情形，您有裁判的权利。如今我有八万法郎的收入。这笔财产使我能够跟特·奥勃里翁家攀亲，他们的独养女儿十九岁，可以给我一个姓氏，一个头衔，一个内廷行走的差使，以及声势显赫的地位。老实告诉您，亲爱的堂姊，我对特·奥勃里翁小姐没有一点儿爱情；但是和她联姻之后，我替孩子预留了一个地位，将来的便宜简直无法估计：因为尊重王室的思想慢慢地又在抬头了。几年之后，我的儿子承袭了特·奥勃里翁侯爵，有了四万法郎的采邑，他便爱做什么官都可以了。我们应当对儿子负责。您瞧，堂姊，我多么善意地把我的心，把我的希望，把我的财产，告诉给您听。可能在您那方面，经过了七年的离别，您已经忘记了我们幼稚的行为；可是我，我既没有忘记您的宽容，也没忘记我的诺言；我什么话都记得，即使在最不经意的时候说的话，换了一个不像我这样认真的，不像我这样保持童心而诚实的青年，是早已想不起的了。我告诉您，我只想为了地位财产而结婚，告诉您我还记得我们童年的爱情，这不就是把我交给了您，由您做主吗？这也就是告诉您，如果要我放弃尘世的野心，我也甘心情愿享受朴素纯洁的幸福，那种动人的情景，您也早已给我领略过了……

您的忠实的堂弟　查理

在签名的时候，查理哼着一阕歌剧的调子：“铛嗒嗒——铛嗒嘀——叮嗒嗒——咚！——咚嗒嘀——叮嗒嗒……”

“天哪！这就叫作略施小计。”他对自己说。

然后他找出汇票，添注了一笔：

附上汇票一张，请向台·格拉桑银号照兑，票面八千法郎，可用黄金支付。这是包括您慷慨惠借的六千法郎的本利。另有几件东西预备送给您，表示我永远的感激；可是那口箱子还在波尔多，没有运到，且待以后送上。我的梳妆匣，请交驿车带回，地址是伊勒冷—裴尔敦街，特·奥勃里翁府邸。

“交驿车带回！”欧也妮自言自语地说，“我为了它拼命的东西，交驿车带回。”

伤心残酷的劫数！船沉掉了，希望的大海上，连一根绳索、一块薄板都没有留下。

受到遗弃之后，有些女子会去把爱人从情敌手中抢回，把情敌杀死，逃到天涯海角，或是上断头台，或是进坟墓。这当然很美。犯罪的动机是一片悲壮的热情，令人觉得法无可恕，情实可悯。另外一些女子却低下头去，不声不响地受苦，她们奄奄一息地隐忍，啜泣，宽恕，祈祷，相思，直到咽气为止。这是爱，是真爱，是天使的爱，以痛苦生以痛苦死的高傲的爱。这便是欧也妮读了这封残酷的信以后的心情。她举眼望着天，想起了母亲的遗言。像有些临终的人一样，母亲是一眼之间把前途看清看透了的。然后欧也妮记起了这先知般的一生和去世的情形，一转瞬间悟到了自己的命运。她只有振翼高飞，努力往天上扑去，在祈祷中等待她的解脱。

“母亲说得不错，”她哭着对自己说，“只有受苦与死亡。”

她脚步极慢地从花园走向堂屋。跟平时的习惯相反，她不走甬道；但灰灰的堂屋里依旧有她堂兄弟的纪念物：壁炉架上老摆着那只小碟子，她每天吃早点都拿来用的，还有那赛佛旧瓷的糖壶。这一天为她真是庄严重大的日子，发生了多少大事。拿侬来通报本区的教士到了。他和克罗旭家是亲戚，也是关心特·篷风所长利益的人。几天以前老克罗旭神父把他说服了，叫他在纯粹宗教的立场上，跟葛朗台小姐谈一谈她必须结婚的义务。欧也妮一看见他，以为他来收一千法郎津贴穷人的月费，便叫拿侬去拿钱；可是教士笑道：

“小姐，今天我来跟你谈一个可怜的姑娘的事，整个索漠都在关心她，因为她自己不知爱惜，她的生活方式不够称为一个基督徒。”

“我的上帝！这时我简直不能想到旁人，我自顾还不暇呢。我痛苦极了，除了教会，没有地方好逃，只有它宽大的心胸才容得了我们所有的苦恼，只有它丰富的感情，我们才能取之不尽。”

“哎，小姐，我们照顾了这位姑娘，同时就照顾了你。听我说！如果你要永生，你只有两条路好走：或者是出家，或者是服从在家的规律；或者听从你俗世的命运，或者听从你天国的命运。”

“啊！好极了，正在我需要指引的时候，你来指引我。对了，一定是上帝派你来的，神父。我要向世界告别，不声不响地隐在一边为上帝生活。”

“取这种极端的行动，孩子，是需要长时期的考虑的。结婚是生，修道是死。”

“好呀，神父，死，马上就死！”她兴奋的口气叫人害怕。

“死？可是，你对社会负有重大的义务呢，小姐。你不是穷人的母亲，冬天给他们衣服柴火，夏天给他们工作吗？你巨大的家私是一种债务，要偿还的，这是你已经用圣洁的心地接受了的。往修道院一躲是太自私了，终身做老姑娘又不应该。先是你怎么能独自管理偌大的家业？也许你会把它丢了。一桩又一桩的官司会弄得你焦头烂额，无法解决。听你牧师[3]的话吧：你需要一个丈夫，你应当把上帝赐给你的加以保存。这些话，是我把你当作亲爱的信徒而说的。你那么真诚地爱上帝，绝不能不在俗世上求永生；你是世界上最美的装饰之一，给了人家多少圣洁的榜样。”

这时仆人通报台·格拉桑太太来到。她是气愤之极，存了报复的心思来的。

“小姐……啊！神父在这里……我不说了，我是来商量俗事的，看来你在谈重要的事情。”

“太太，”神父说，“我让你。”

“噢！神父，”欧也妮说，“过一会儿再来吧，今天我正需要你的支持。”

“不错，可怜的孩子。”台·格拉桑太太插嘴。

“什么意思？”葛朗台小姐和神父一齐问。

“难道你堂兄弟回来了，要娶特·奥勃里翁小姐，我还不知道吗？……一个女人不会这么糊涂的。”

欧也妮脸上一红，不出一声；但她决意从此要像父亲一般装作若无其事。

“哎，太太，”她带着嘲弄的意味，“我倒真是糊涂呢，不懂你的意思。你说吧，不用回避神父，你知道他是我的牧师。”

“好吧，小姐，这是台·格拉桑给我的信，你念吧。”

欧也妮接过信来念道：

贤妻如面：查理·葛朗台从印度回来，到巴黎已有一月……

——一个月！欧也妮心里想，把手垂了下来。停了一会儿，又往下念：

……我白跑了两次，方始见到这位未来的特·奥勃里翁伯爵。虽然全个巴黎都在谈论他的婚事，教会也公布了婚事征询……

——那么他写信给我的时候已经……欧也妮没有往下再想，也没有像巴黎女子般叫一声：“这无赖！”可是虽然面上毫无表现，她心中的轻蔑并没减少一点儿。

……这头亲事还渺茫得很呢：特·奥勃里翁侯爵绝不肯把女儿嫁给一个破产的人的儿子。我特意去告诉查理，我和他的伯父如何费心料理他父亲的事，用了如何巧妙的手段才把债权人按捺到今天。这傲慢的小子胆敢回我——为了他的利益与名誉，日夜不息帮忙了五年的我，说，他父亲的事不是他的事！为这件案子，一个诉讼代理人真可以问他要三万到四万法郎的酬金，合到债务的百分之一。可是，且慢，他的的确确还欠债权人一百二十万法郎，我非把他的父亲宣告破产不可。当初我接手这件事，完全凭了葛朗台那老鳄鱼一句话，并且我早已代表他的家属对债权人承诺下来。尽管特·奥勃里翁伯爵不在乎他的名誉，我却很看重我自己的名誉。所以我要把我的地位向债权人说明。可是我素来敬重欧也妮小姐——你记得，当初我们境况较好的时候，曾经对她有过提亲的意思——所以在我采取行动之前，你必须去跟她谈一谈……

念到这里，欧也妮立刻停下，冷冷地把信还给了台·格拉桑太太，说：

“谢谢你，慢慢再说吧……”

“哎哟，此刻你的声音和你从前老太爷的一模一样。”

“太太，你有八千法郎金子要付给我们哪。”拿侬对她说。

“不错；劳驾你跟我去一趟罢，高诺阿莱太太。”

欧也妮心里已经拿定主意，所以态度很大方、很镇静地说：

“请问神父，结婚以后保持童身，算不算罪过？”

“这是一个宗教里的道德问题，我不能回答。要是你想知道那有名的桑凯士[4]在《神学要略》的《婚姻篇》内怎样说，明天我可以告诉你。”

神父走了。葛朗台小姐上楼到父亲的密室内待了一天，吃饭的时候，拿侬再三催促也不肯下来。直到晚上客人照例登门的时候，她才出现。葛朗台家从没有这一晚那样的宾客满堂。查理的回来，和奇蠢无比的忘恩负义的消息，早已传遍全城。但来客尽管聚精会神地观察，也无法满足他们的好奇心。早有准备的欧也妮，镇静的脸上一点儿都不露出在胸中激荡的惨痛的情绪。人家用哀怨的眼神和感伤的言语对她表示关切，她居然能报以笑容。她终于以谦恭有礼的态度，掩饰了她的苦难。

九点左右，牌局完了，打牌的人离开桌子，一边算账一边讨论最后的几局韦斯脱，走来加入谈天的圈子。正当大家一伙儿起身预备告辞的时候，忽然展开了富有戏剧性的一幕，震动了索漠，震动了一州，震动了周围四个州府。

“所长，你慢一步走。”欧也妮看见特·篷风先生拿起手杖的时候，这么说。

听到这句话，个个人都为之一怔。所长脸色发白，不由得坐了下来。

“千万家私是所长的了。”特·格里鲍果小姐说。

“还不明白吗，”特·奥松华太太接着嚷道，“特·篷风所长娶定了葛朗台小姐。”

“这才是最妙的一局哩。”老神父说。

“和了满贯哪。”公证人说。

每个人都有他的妙语，双关语，把欧也妮看作高踞在千万家私之上，好似高踞在宝座上一样。酝酿了八年的大事到了结束的阶段。当了整个索漠城的面，叫所长留下，不就等于宣布她决定嫁给他了吗？礼节体统在小城市中是极严格的，像这一类出乎常规的举动，当然成为最庄严的诺言了。

客人散尽之后，欧也妮声音激动地说道：

“所长，我知道你喜欢我的什么。你得起誓，在我活着的时候，让我自由，永远不向我提起婚姻给你的权利，那么我可以答应嫁给你。噢！我的话还没有完呢，”她看见所长跪了下去，便赶紧补充，“我不会对你不忠实，先生。可是我心里有一股熄灭不了的感情。我能够给丈夫的只有友谊：我既不愿使他难受，也不愿违背我心里的信念。可是你得帮我一次大忙，才能得到我的婚约和产业。”

“赴汤蹈火都可以。”所长回答。

“这儿是一百五十万法郎，”她从怀中掏出一张法兰西银行一百五十股的股票，“请你上巴黎，不是明天，不是今夜，而是当场立刻。你到台·格拉桑先生那里，去找出我叔父的全部债权人名单，把他们召集起来，把叔父所欠的本金，以及到付款日为止的全部息金，照五厘计算，一律付清，要他们立一张总收据，经公证人签字证明，一切照应有的手续办理。你是法官，这件事我只信托你一个人。你是一个正直的、有义气的男子：我将来就凭你一句话，靠你夫家的姓，挨过人生的危难。我们将来相忍相让。认识了这么多年，我们差不多是一家人了，想你一定不会使我痛苦的。”

所长扑倒在有钱的承继人脚下，又快活又凄怆地浑身哆嗦。

“我一定做你的奴隶！”他说。

“你拿到了收据，先生，”她冷冷地望了他一眼，“你把它和所有的借券一齐送给我的堂兄弟，另外把这封信交给他。等你回来，我履行我的诺言。”

所长很明白他的得到葛朗台小姐，完全是由于爱情的怨望；所以他急急要把她的事赶快办了，免得两个情人有讲和的机会。

特·篷风先生走了，欧也妮倒在沙发里哭作一团。一切都完了。所长雇了驿车，次日晚上到了巴黎。第二日清晨他去见台·格拉桑。法官邀请债权人到存放债券的公证人事务所会齐，他们居然一个也没有缺席。虽然全是债主，可是说句公道话，这一次他们都准时而到。然后特·篷风所长以葛朗台小姐的名义，把本利一并付给了他们。照付利息这一点，在巴黎商界中轰动一时。

所长拿到了收据，又依照欧也妮的吩咐，送了五万法郎给台·格拉桑做报酬，然后上特·奥勃里翁侯爵府。他进门的时候，查理正碰了丈人的钉子回到自己屋里。老爵爷告诉他，一定要等琪奥默·葛朗台的债务清偿之后，才能把女儿嫁给他。

所长先把下面的一封信交给查理：

堂弟大鉴：叔父所欠的债务，业已全部清偿，特由特·篷风所长送上收据一张。另附收据一张，证明我上述代垫的款项已由吾弟归还。外面有破产的传说，我想一个破产的人的儿子未必能娶特·奥勃里翁小姐。您批评我的头脑与态度的话，确有见地：我的确毫无上流社会的气息，那些计算与风气习惯，我都不知；您所期待的乐趣，我无法贡献。您为了服从社会的惯例，牺牲了我们的初恋，但愿您在社会的惯例之下快乐。我只能把您父亲的名誉献给您，来成全您的幸福。别了！愚姊永远是您忠实的朋友。

欧也妮

这位野心家拿到正式的文件，不由自主地叫了一声，使所长看了微笑。

“咱们现在不妨交换喜讯啦。”他对查理说。

“啊！你要娶欧也妮？好吧，我很高兴，她是一个好人。”

——他忽然心中一亮，接着说：“哎，那么她很有钱喽？”

“四天以前，”所长带着挖苦的口吻回答，“她有将近一千九百万；可是今天她只有一千七了。”

查理望着所长，发呆了。

“一千七百……万……”

“对，一千七百万，先生。结婚之后，我和葛朗台小姐总共有七十五万法郎收入。”

“亲爱的姊丈，”查理的态度又镇静了些，“咱们好彼此提携提携啦。”

“行！”所长回答，“这里还有一口小箱子，非当面交给你不可。”他把梳妆匣放在了桌上。

“喂，好朋友，”特·奥勃里翁侯爵夫人进来的当儿，根本没有注意到克罗旭，“刚才特·奥勃里翁先生说的话，你一点儿不用放在心上，他是给特·旭礼欧公爵夫人迷昏了。我再告诉你一遍，你的婚事绝无问题……”

“绝无问题，”查理应声回答，“我父亲欠的三百万，昨天都还清了。”

“付了现款吗？”

“不折不扣，连本带利：我还得替先父办复权手续呢。”

“你太傻了！”他的丈母叫道，“这位是谁？”她看到了克罗旭，咬着女婿的耳朵问。

“我的经纪人。”他低声回答。

侯爵夫人对特·篷风先生傲慢地点了点头，走了出去。

“咱们已经在彼此提携啦，”所长拿起帽子说，“再见吧，内弟。”

“他竟开我玩笑，这索漠的臭八哥。恨不得一剑戳破他的肚子才好。”

所长走了。三天以后，特·篷风先生回到索漠，公布了他与欧也妮的婚事。过了六个月，他升了安越法院的推事。

离开索漠之前，欧也妮把多少年来心爱的金饰熔掉了，加上堂兄弟偿还的八千法郎，铸了一口黄金的圣体匣，献给本区的教堂，在那里，她为他曾经向上帝祷告过多少年！

平时她在安越与索漠两地来来往往。她的丈夫在某次政治运动上出了力，升了高等法院庭长，过了几年又升了院长。他很焦心地等着大选，好进国会。他的念头已经转到贵族院了，那时……

“那时，王上跟他是不是称兄道弟了？”拿侬，长脚拿侬，高诺阿莱太太，索漠的布尔乔亚，听见女主人提到将来显赫的声势时，不禁说出这么一句。

结局


虽然如此，特·篷风院长（他终于把产业的名字代替了老家克罗旭的姓）野心勃勃的梦想，一桩也没有实现。发表为索漠议员八天以后，他就死了。

洞烛幽微而罚不及无辜的上帝，一定是谴责他的心计与玩弄法律的手段。他由克罗旭做参谋，在结婚契约上订明“倘将来并无子女，则夫妇双方之财产，包括动产不动产，绝无例外与保留，一律全部互相遗赠；且夫妇任何一方身故之后，得不再依照例行手续举办遗产登记，但自以不损害继承人权利为原则，须知上述夫妇互相遗赠财产之举确为……”这一项条款，便是院长始终尊重特·篷风太太的意志与独居的理由。妇女们提起院长，总认为他是一个最体贴的人，而对他表示同情；她们往往谴责欧也妮的隐痛与痴情，而且在谴责一个女人的时候，她们照例是很刻毒的。

“特·篷风太太一定是病得很厉害，否则绝不会让丈夫独居的。可怜的太太！她就会好吗？究竟是什么病呀，胃炎吗？癌症吗？为什么不去看医生呢？这些时候她脸色都黄了，她应该上巴黎去请教那些名医。她怎么不想生一个孩子呢？据说她非常爱丈夫，那么以他的地位，怎么不给他留一个后代承继遗产呢？真是可怕。倘使单单为了任性，那简直是罪过……可怜的院长！”

欧也妮因为幽居独处、长期默想的结果，变得感觉灵敏，对周围的事故看得很清，加上不幸的遭遇与最后的教训，她对什么都猜得透。她知道院长希望她早死，好独占这笔巨大的家私——因为上帝忽发奇想，把两位老叔——公证人和教士——都召归了天国，使他的财产愈加庞大了。欧也妮只觉院长可怜。不料全知全能的上帝，代她把丈夫居心叵测的计划完全推翻了：他尊重欧也妮无望的痴情，表示满不在乎，其实他觉得不与妻子同居倒是最可靠的保障；要是生了一个孩子，院长的自私的希望，野心勃勃的快意，不是都归泡影了吗？

如今上帝把大堆的黄金丢给被黄金束缚的女子，而她根本不把黄金放在心上，只在向往天国，过着虔诚慈爱的生活，只有一些圣洁的思想，不断地暗中援助受难的人。

特·篷风太太三十三岁上做了寡妇，富有八十万法郎的收入，依旧很美，可是像个将近四十的女人的美。白白的脸，安闲，镇静。声音柔和而沉着，举止单纯。她有痛苦的崇高伟大，有灵魂并没被尘世玷污过的人的圣洁，但也有老处女的僵硬的神气，和内地闭塞生活养成的器局狭小的习惯。虽然富有八十万法郎的岁收，她依旧过着当年欧也妮·葛朗台的生活，非到了父亲从前允许堂屋里生火的日子，她的卧房绝不生火，熄火的日子也依照她年轻时代的老规矩。她的衣着永远跟当年的母亲一样。索漠的屋子，没有阳光，没有暖气，老是阴森森的，凄凉的屋子，便是她一生的小影。她把所有的收入谨谨慎慎地积聚起来，要不是她慷慨解囊的拨充善举，也许还显得吝啬呢。可是她办了不少公益与虔诚的事业，一所养老院，几处教会小学，一所庋藏丰富的图书馆，等于每年向人家责备她吝啬的话提出反证。索漠的几座教堂，靠她的捐助，多添了一些装修。特·篷风太太，有些人刻薄地叫作小姐，很受一般人敬重。由此可见，这颗只知有温情而不知有其他的高尚的心，还是逃不了人间利益的算盘。金钱不免把它冷冰冰的光彩，沾染了这个超脱一切的生命，使这个感情丰富的女子也不敢相信感情了。

“只有你爱我。”她对拿侬说。

这女子的手抚慰了多少家庭的隐痛。她夹着一连串善行义举向天国前进。心灵的伟大，抵消了她教育的鄙陋和早年的习惯。这便是欧也妮的故事，她在世等于出家，天生的贤妻良母，却既无丈夫，又无儿女，又无家庭。

几天以来，大家又提到她再嫁的问题。索漠人在注意她跟特·法劳丰侯爵的事，因为这一家正开始包围这个有钱的寡妇，像当年克罗旭他们一样。

据说拿侬与高诺阿莱两人都站在侯爵方面：这真是荒唐的谣言。长脚拿侬和高诺阿莱的聪明，都还不够懂得世道人心的败坏。

I


There are houses in certain provincial towns whose aspect inspires melancholy, akin to that called forth by sombre cloisters, dreary moorlands, or the desolation of ruins. Within these houses there is, perhaps, the silence of the cloister, the barrenness of moors, the skeleton of ruins; life and movement are so stagnant there that a stranger might think them uninhabited, were it not that he encounters suddenly the pale, cold glance of a motionless person, whose half-monastic face peers beyond the window-casing at the sound of an unaccustomed step.

Such elements of sadness formed the physiognomy, as it were, of a dwelling-house in Saumur which stands at the end of the steep street leading to the chateau in the upper part of the town. This street—now little frequented, hot in summer, cold in winter, dark in certain sections—is remarkable for the resonance of its little pebbly pavement, always clean and dry, for the narrowness of its tortuous road-way, for the peaceful stillness of its houses, which belong to the Old town and are over-topped by the ramparts.

Houses three centuries old are still solid, though built of wood, and their divers aspects add to the originality which commends this portion of Saumur to the attention of artists and antiquaries. It is difficult to pass these houses without admiring the enormous oaken beams, their ends carved into fantastic figures, which crown with a black bas-relief the lower floor of most of them.

In one place these transverse timbers are covered with slate and mark a bluish line along the frail wall of a dwelling covered by a roof en colombage which bends beneath the weight of years, and whose rotting shingles are twisted by the alternate action of sun and rain. In another place blackened, worn-out window-sills, with delicate sculptures now scarcely discernible, seem too weak to bear the brown clay pots from which springs the heart's-ease or the rose-bush of some poor working-woman. Farther on are doors studded with enormous nails, where the genius of our forefathers has traced domestic hieroglyphics, of which the meaning is now lost forever. Here a Protestant attested his belief; there a Leaguer cursed Henry IV.; elsewhere some bourgeois has carved the insignia of his noblesse de cloches, symbols of his long-forgotten magisterial glory. The whole history of France is there. Next to a tottering house with roughly plastered walls, where an artisan enshrines his tools, rises the mansion of a country gentleman, on the stone arch of which above the door vestiges of armorial bearings may still be seen, battered by the many revolutions that have shaken France since 1789.

In this hilly street the ground-floors of the merchants are neither shops nor warehouses; lovers of the Middle Ages will here find the ouvrouere of our forefathers in all its naive simplicity. These low rooms, which have no shop-frontage, no show-windows, in fact no glass at all, are deep and dark and without interior or exterior decoration. Their doors open in two parts, each roughly iron-bound;the upper half is fastened back within the room, the lower half, fitted with a spring-bell, swings continually to and fro. Air and light reach the damp den within, either through the upper half of the door, or through an open space between the ceiling and a low front wall, breast-high, which is closed by solid shutters that are taken down every morning, put up every evening, and held in place by heavy iron bars.This wall serves as a counter for the merchandise. No delusive display is there; only samples of the business, whatever it may chance to be—such, for instance, as three or four tubs full of codfish and salt, a few bundles of sail-cloth, cordage, copper wire hanging from the joists above, iron hoops for casks ranged along the wall, or a few pieces of cloth upon the shelves.

Enter. A neat girl, glowing with youth, wearing a white kerchief, her arms red and bare, drops her knitting and calls her father or her mother, one of whom comes forward and sells you what you want, phlegmatically, civilly, or arrogantly, according to his or her individual character, whether it be a matter of two sous’ or twenty thousand francs’ worth of merchandise.

You may see a cooper, for instance, sitting in his doorway and twirling his thumbs as he talks with a neighbor. To all appearance he owns nothing more than a few miserable boat-ribs and two or three bundles of laths; but below in the port his teeming wood-yard supplies all the cooperage trade of Anjou. He knows to a plank how many casks are needed if the vintage is good. A hot season makes him rich, a rainy season ruins him; in a single morning puncheons worth eleven francs have been known to drop to six.

In this country, as in Touraine, atmospheric vicissitudes control commercial life. Wine-growers, proprietors, wood-merchants, coopers, inn-keepers, mariners, all keep watch of the sun. They tremble when they go to bed lest they should hear in the morning of a frost in the night; they dread rain, wind, drought, and want water, heat, and clouds to suit their fancy. A perpetual duel goes on between the heavens and their terrestrial interests. The barometer smooths, saddens, or makes merry their countenances, turn and turn about.

From end to end of this street, formerly the Grand’Rue de Saumur, the words: “Here’s golden weather,” are passed from door to door; or each man calls to his neighbor: “It rains louis,” knowing well what a sunbeam or the opportune rainfall is bringing him. On Saturdays after midday, in the fine season, not one sou’s worth of merchandise can be bought from these worthy traders. Each has his vineyard, his enclosure of fields, and all spend two days in the country. This being foreseen, and purchases, sales, and profits provided for, the merchants have ten or twelve hours to spend in parties of pleasure, in making observations, in criticisms, and in continual spying. A housewife cannot buy a partridge without the neighbors asking the husband if it were cooked to a turn. A young girl never puts her head near a window that she is not seen by idling groups in the street. Consciences are held in the light; and the houses, dark, silent, impenetrable as they seem, hide no mysteries.

Life is almost wholly in the open air; every household sits at its own threshold, breakfasts, dines, and quarrels there. No one can pass along the street without being examined; in fact formerly, when a stranger entered a provincial town he was bantered and made game of from door to door. From this came many good stories, and the nickname copieux, which was applied to the inhabitants of Angers, who excelled in such urban sarcasms.

The ancient mansions of the old town of Saumur are at the top of this hilly street, and were formerly occupied by the nobility of the neighborhood. The melancholy dwelling where the events of the following history took place is one of these mansions—venerable relics of a century in which men and things bore the characteristics of simplicity which French manners and customs are losing day by day.

Follow the windings of the picturesque thoroughfare, whose irregularities awaken recollections that plunge the mind mechanically into reverie, and you will see a somewhat dark recess, in the centre of which is hidden the door of the house of Monsieur Grandet.

It is impossible to understand the force of this provincial expression—the house of Monsieur Grandet—without giving the biography of Monsieur Grandet himself.

Monsieur Grandet enjoyed a reputation in Saumur whose causes and effects can never be fully understood by those who have not, at one time or another, lived in the provinces. In 1789, Monsieur Grandet—still called by certain persons le Pere Grandet, though the number of such old persons has perceptibly diminished—was a master-cooper, able to read, write, and cipher. At the period when the French Republic offered for sale the church property in the arrondissement of Saumur, the cooper, then forty years of age, had just married the daughter of a rich wood-merchant. Supplied with the ready money of his own fortune and his wife’s dot, in all about two thousand louis-d’or, Grandet went to the newly established“district,” where, with the help of two hundred double louis given by his father-in-law to the surly republican who presided over the sales of the national domain, he obtained for a song, legally if not legitimately, one of the finest vineyards in the arrondissement, an old abbey, and several farms.

The inhabitants of Saumur were so little revolutionary that they thought Pere Grandet a bold man, a republican, and a patriot with a mind open to all the new ideas; though in point of fact it was open only to vineyards. He was appointed a member of the administration of Saumur, and his pacific influence made itself felt politically and commercially.

Politically, he protected the ci-devant nobles, and prevented, to the extent of his power, the sale of the lands and property of the emigres; commercially, he furnished the Republican armies with two or three thousand puncheons of white wine, and took his pay in splendid fields belonging to a community of women whose lands had been reserved for the last lot.

Under the Consulate Grandet became mayor, governed wisely, and harvested still better pickings. Under the Empire he was called Monsieur Grandet. Napoleon, however, did not like republicans, and superseded Monsieur Grandet (who was supposed to have worn the Phrygian cap) by a man of his own surroundings, a future baron of the Empire. Monsieur Grandet quitted office without regret. He had constructed in the interests of the town certain fine roads which led to his own property; his house and lands, very advantageously assessed, paid moderate taxes; and since the registration of his various estates, the vineyards, thanks to his constant care, had become the “head of the country,”—a local term used to denote those that produced the finest quality of wine. He might have asked for the cross of the Legion of honor.

This event occurred in 1806. Monsieur Grandet was then fifty-seven years of age, his wife thirty-six, and an only daughter, the fruit of their legitimate love, was ten years old.

Monsieur Grandet, whom Providence no doubt desired to compensate for the loss of his municipal honors, inherited three fortunes in the course of this year—that of Madame de la Gaudiniere, born de la Bertelliere, the mother of Madame Grandet;that of old Monsieur de la Bertelliere, her grandfather; and, lastly, that of Madame Gentillet, her grandmother on the mother’s side:three inheritances, whose amount was not known to any one. The avarice of the deceased persons was so keen that for a long time they had hoarded their money for the pleasure of secretly looking at it. Old Monsieur de la Bertelliere called an investment an extravagance, and thought he got better interest from the sight of his gold than from the profits of usury. The inhabitants of Saumur consequently estimated his savings according to “the revenues of the sun’s wealth,” as they said.

Monsieur Grandet thus obtained that modern title of nobility which our mania for equality can never rub out. He became the most imposing personage in the arrondissement. He worked a hundred acres of vineyard, which in fruitful years yielded seven or eight hundred hogsheads of wine. He owned thirteen farms, an old abbey, whose windows and arches he had walled up for the sake of economy—a measure which preserved them—also a hundred and twenty-seven acres of meadow-land, where three thousand poplars, planted in 1793, grew and flourished; and finally, the house in which he lived.

Such was his visible estate; as to his other property, only two persons could give even a vague guess at its value: one was Monsieur Cruchot, a notary employed in the usurious investments of Monsieur Grandet; the other was Monsieur des Grassins, the richest banker in Saumur, in whose profits Grandet had a certain covenanted and secret share.Although old Cruchot and Monsieur des Grassins were both gifted with the deep discretion which wealth and trust beget in the provinces, they publicly testified so much respect to Monsieur Grandet that observers estimated the amount of his property by the obsequious attention which they bestowed upon him.

In all Saumur there was no one not persuaded that Monsieur Grandet had a private treasure, some hiding-place full of louis, where he nightly took ineffable delight in gazing upon great masses of gold. Avaricious people gathered proof of this when they looked at the eyes of the good man, to which the yellow metal seemed to have conveyed its tints. The glance of a man accustomed to draw enormous interest from his capital acquires, like that of the libertine, the gambler, or the sycophant, certain indefinable habits—furtive, eager, mysterious movements, which never escape the notice of his co-religionists. This secret language is in a certain way the freemasonry of the passions.

Monsieur Grandet inspired the respectful esteem due to one who owed no man anything, who, skilful cooper and experienced wine-grower that he was, guessed with the precision of an astronomer whether he ought to manufacture a thousand puncheons for his vintage, or only five hundred, who never failed in any speculation, and always had casks for sale when casks were worth more than the commodity that filled them, who could store his whole vintage in his cellars and bide his time to put the puncheons on the market at two hundred francs, when the little proprietors had been forced to sell theirs for five louis. His famous vintage of 1811, judiciously stored and slowly disposed of, brought him in more than two hundred and forty thousand francs. Financially speaking, Monsieur Grandet was something between a tiger and a boa-constrictor. He could crouch and lie low, watch his prey a long while, spring upon it, open his jaws, swallow a mass of louis, and then rest tranquilly like a snake in process of digestion, impassible, methodical, and cold.

No one saw him pass without a feeling of admiration mingled with respect and fear; had not every man in Saumur felt the rending of those polished steel claws? For this one, Maitre Cruchot had procured the money required for the purchase of a domain, but at eleven per cent. For that one, Monsieur des Grassins discounted bills of exchange, but at a frightful deduction of interest. Few days ever passed that Monsieur Grandet’s name was not mentioned either in the markets or in social conversations at the evening gatherings. To some the fortune of the old wine-grower was an object of patriotic pride. More than one merchant, more than one innkeeper, said to strangers with a certain complacency: “Monsieur, we have two or three millionaire establishments; but as for Monsieur Grandet, he does not himself know how much he is worth.”

In 1816 the best reckoners in Saumur estimated the landed property of the worthy man at nearly four millions; but as, on an average, he had made yearly, from 1793 to 1817, a hundred thousand francs out of that property, it was fair to presume that he possessed in actual money a sum nearly equal to the value of his estate. So that when, after a game of boston or an evening discussion on the matter of vines, the talk fell upon Monsieur Grandet, knowing people said:“Le Pere Grandet? Le Pere Grandet must have at least five or six millions.”

“You are cleverer than I am; I have never been able to find out the amount,” answered Monsieur Cruchot or Monsieur des Grassins, when either chanced to overhear the remark.If some Parisian mentioned Rothschild or Monsieur Lafitte, the people of Saumur asked if he were as rich as Monsieur Grandet. When the Parisian, with a smile, tossed them a disdainful affirmative, they looked at each other and shook their heads with an incredulous air.

So large a fortune covered with a golden mantle all the actions of this man. If in early days some peculiarities of his life gave occasion for laughter or ridicule, laughter and ridicule had long since died away. His least important actions had the authority of results repeatedly shown. His speech, his clothing, his gestures, the blinking of his eyes, were law to the country-side, where every one, after studying him as a naturalist studies the result of instinct in the lower animals, had come to understand the deep mute wisdom of his slightest actions.

“It will be a hard winter,” said one; “Pere Grandet has put on his fur gloves.”

“Pere Grandet is buying quantities of staves; there will be plenty of wine this year.”

Monsieur Grandet never bought either bread or meat. His farmers supplied him weekly with a sufficiency of capons, chickens, eggs, butter, and his tithe of wheat. He owned a mill; and the tenant was bound, over and above his rent, to take a certain quantity of grain and return him the flour and bran. La Grande Nanon, his only servant, though she was no longer young, baked the bread of the household herself every Saturday. Monsieur Grandet arranged with kitchen-gardeners who were his tenants to supply him with vegetables. As to fruits, he gathered such quantities that he sold the greater part in the market. His fire-wood was cut from his own hedgerows or taken from the half-rotten old sheds which he built at the corners of his fields, and whose planks the farmers carted into town for him, all cut up, and obligingly stacked in his wood-house, receiving in return his thanks. His only known expenditures were for the consecrated bread, the clothing of his wife and daughter, the hire of their chairs in church, the wages of la Grand Nanon, the tinning of the saucepans, lights, taxes, repairs on his buildings, and the costs of his various industries. He had six hundred acres of woodland, lately purchased, which he induced a neighbor’s keeper to watch, under the promise of an indemnity. After the acquisition of this property he ate game for the first time.

Monsieur Grandet’s manners were very simple. He spoke little. He usually expressed his meaning by short sententious phrases uttered in a soft voice. After the Revolution, the epoch at which he first came into notice, the good man stuttered in a wearisome way as soon as he was required to speak at length or to maintain an argument. This stammering, the incoherence of his language, the flux of words in which he drowned his thought, his apparent lack of logic, attributed to defects of education, were in reality assumed, and will be sufficiently explained by certain events in the following history. Four sentences, precise as algebraic formulas, sufficed him usually to grasp and solve all difficulties of life and commerce: “I don’t know; I cannot; I will not; I will see about it.”

He never said yes, or no, and never committed himself to writing. If people talked to him he listened coldly, holding his chin in his right hand and resting his right elbow in the back of his left hand, forming in his own mind opinions on all matters, from which he never receded. He reflected long before making any business agreement. When his opponent, after careful conversation, avowed the secret of his own purposes, confident that he had secured his listener’s assent, Grandet answered: “I can decide nothing without consulting my wife.”

His wife, whom he had reduced to a state of helpless slavery, was a useful screen to him in business. He went nowhere among friends; he neither gave nor accepted dinners; he made no stir or noise, seeming to economize in everything, even movement. He never disturbed or disarranged the things of other people, out of respect for the rights of property.

Nevertheless, in spite of his soft voice, in spite of his circumspect bearing, the language and habits of a coarse nature came to the surface, especially in his own home, where he controlled himself less than elsewhere.

Physically, Grandet was a man five feet high, thick-set, square-built, with calves twelve inches in circumference, knotted knee-joints, and broad shoulders; his face was round, tanned, and pitted by the small-pox; his chin was straight, his lips had no curves, his teeth were white; his eyes had that calm, devouring expression which people attribute to the basilisk; his forehead, full of transverse wrinkles, was not without certain significant protuberances; his yellow-grayish hair was said to be silver and gold by certain young people who did not realize the impropriety of making a jest about Monsieur Grandet. His nose, thick at the end, bore a veined wen, which the common people said, not without reason, was full of malice. The whole countenance showed a dangerous cunning, an integrity without warmth, the egotism of a man long used to concentrate every feeling upon the enjoyments of avarice and upon the only human being who was anything whatever to him—his daughter and sole heiress, Eugenie. Attitude, manners, bearing, everything about him, in short, testified to that belief in himself which the habit of succeeding in all enterprises never fails to give to a man.

Thus, though his manners were unctuous and soft outwardly, Monsieur Grandet’s nature was of iron. His dress never varied;and those who saw him to-day saw him such as he had been since 1791. His stout shoes were tied with leathern thongs; he wore, in all weathers, thick woollen stockings, short breeches of coarse maroon cloth with silver buckles, a velvet waistcoat, in alternate stripes of yellow and puce, buttoned squarely, a large maroon coat with wide flaps, a black cravat, and a quaker’s hat. His gloves, thick as those of a gendarme, lasted him twenty months; to preserve them, he always laid them methodically on the brim of his hat in one particular spot.

Saumur knew nothing further about this personage.

Only six individuals had a right of entrance to Monsieur Grandet’s house. The most important of the first three was a nephew of Monsieur Cruchot. Since his appointment as president of the Civil courts of Saumur this young man had added the name of Bonfons to that of Cruchot. He now signed himself C. de Bonfons. Any litigant so ill-advised as to call him Monsieur Cruchot would soon be made to feel his folly in court. The magistrate protected those who called him Monsieur le president, but he favored with gracious smiles those who addressed him as Monsieur de Bonfons. Monsieur le president was thirty-three years old, and possessed the estate of Bonfons (Boni Fontis), worth seven thousand francs a year; he expected to inherit the property of his uncle the notary and that of another uncle, the Abbe Cruchot, a dignitary of the chapter of Saint-Martin de Tours, both of whom were thought to be very rich. These three Cruchots, backed by a goodly number of cousins, and allied to twenty families in the town, formed a party, like the Medici in Florence; like the Medici, the Cruchots had their Pazzi.

Madame des Grassins, mother of a son twenty-three years of age, came assiduously to play cards with Madame Grandet, hoping to marry her dear Adolphe to Mademoiselle Eugenie. Monsieur des Grassins, the banker, vigorously promoted the schemes of his wife by means of secret services constantly rendered to the old miser, and always arrived in time upon the field of battle. The three des Grassins likewise had their adherents, their cousins, their faithful allies.

On the Cruchot side the abbe, the Talleyrand of the family, well backed-up by his brother the notary, sharply contested every inch of ground with his female adversary, and tried to obtain the rich heiress for his nephew the president.This secret warfare between the Cruchots and des Grassins, the prize thereof being the hand in marriage of Eugenie Grandet, kept the various social circles of Saumur in violent agitation. Would Mademoiselle Grandet marry Monsieur le president or Monsieur Adolphe des Grassins?

To this problem some replied that Monsieur Grandet would never give his daughter to the one or to the other. The old cooper, eaten up with ambition, was looking, they said, for a peer of France, to whom an income of three hundred thousand francs would make all the past, present, and future casks of the Grandets acceptable. Others replied that Monsieur and Madame des Grassins were nobles, and exceedingly rich; that Adolphe was a personable young fellow;and that unless the old man had a nephew of the pope at his beck and call, such a suitable alliance ought to satisfy a man who came from nothing—a man whom Saumur remembered with an adze in his hand, and who had, moreover, worn the bonnet rouge. Certain wise heads called attention to the fact that Monsieur Cruchot de Bonfons had the right of entry to the house at all times, whereas his rival was received only on Sundays. Others, however, maintained that Madame des Grassins was more intimate with the women of the house of Grandet than the Cruchots were, and could put into their minds certain ideas which would lead, sooner or later, to success. To this the former retorted that the Abbe Cruchot was the most insinuating man in the world: pit a woman against a monk, and the struggle was even. “It is diamond cut diamond,” said a Saumur wit.

The oldest inhabitants, wiser than their fellows, declared that the Grandets knew better than to let the property go out of the family, and that Mademoiselle Eugenie Grandet of Saumur would be married to the son of Monsieur Grandet of Paris, a wealthy wholesale wine-merchant. To this the Cruchotines and the Grassinists replied: “In the first place, the two brothers have seen each other only twice in thirty years; and next, Monsieur Grandet of Paris has ambitious designs for his son. He is mayor of an arrondissement, a deputy, colonel of the National Guard, judge in the commercial courts; he disowns the Grandets of Saumur, and means to ally himself with some ducal family—ducal under favor of Napoleon.”

In short, was there anything not said of an heiress who was talked of through a circumference of fifty miles, and even in the public conveyances from Angers to Blois, inclusively!

At the beginning of 1811, the Cruchotines won a signal advantage over the Grassinists. The estate of Froidfond, remarkable for its park, its mansion, its farms, streams, ponds, forests, and worth about three millions, was put up for sale by the young Marquis de Froidfond, who was obliged to liquidate his possessions. Maitre Cruchot, the president, and the abbe, aided by their adherents, were able to prevent the sale of the estate in little lots. The notary concluded a bargain with the young man for the whole property, payable in gold, persuading him that suits without number would have to be brought against the purchasers of small lots before he could get the money for them; it was better, therefore, to sell the whole to Monsieur Grandet, who was solvent and able to pay for the estate in ready money. The fine marquisate of Froidfond was accordingly conveyed down the gullet of Monsieur Grandet, who, to the great astonishment of Saumur, paid for it, under proper discount, with the usual formalities.This affair echoed from Nantes to Orleans.

Monsieur Grandet took advantage of a cart returning by way of Froidfond to go and see his chateau. Having cast a master’s eye over the whole property, he returned to Saumur, satisfied that he had invested his money at five per cent, and seized by the stupendous thought of extending and increasing the marquisate of Froidfond by concentrating all his property there. Then, to fill up his coffers, now nearly empty, he resolved to thin out his woods and his forests, and to sell off the poplars in the meadows.

It is now easy to understand the full meaning of the term, “the house of Monsieur Grandet,”—that cold, silent, pallid dwelling, standing above the town and sheltered by the ruins of the ramparts.

The two pillars and the arch, which made the porte-cochere on which the door opened, were built, like the house itself, of tufa—a white stone peculiar to the shores of the Loire, and so soft that it lasts hardly more than two centuries. Numberless irregular holes, capriciously bored or eaten out by the inclemency of the weather, gave an appearance of the vermiculated stonework of French architecture to the arch and the side walls of this entrance, which bore some resemblance to the gateway of a jail. Above the arch was a long bas-relief, in hard stone, representing the four seasons, the faces already crumbling away and blackened. This bas-relief was surmounted by a projecting plinth, upon which a variety of chance growths had sprung up—yellow pellitory, bindweed, convolvuli, nettles, plantain, and even a little cherry-tree, already grown to some height.

The door of the archway was made of solid oak, brown, shrunken, and split in many places; though frail in appearance, it was firmly held in place by a system of iron bolts arranged in symmetrical patterns. A small square grating, with close bars red with rust, filled up the middle panel and made, as it were, a motive for the knocker, fastened to it by a ring, which struck upon the grinning head of a huge nail. This knocker, of the oblong shape and kind which our ancestors calledjaquemart, looked like a huge note of exclamation; an antiquary who examined it attentively might have found indications of the figure, essentially burlesque, which it once represented, and which long usage had now effaced.

Through this little grating—intended in olden times for the recognition of friends in times of civil war—inquisitive persons could perceive, at the farther end of the dark and slimy vault, a few broken steps which led to a garden, picturesquely shut in by walls that were thick and damp, and through which oozed a moisture that nourished tufts of sickly herbage. These walls were the ruins of the ramparts, under which ranged the gardens of several neighboring houses.

The most important room on the ground-floor of the house was a large hall, entered directly from beneath the vault of the porte-cochere. Few people know the importance of a hall in the little towns of Anjou, Touraine, and Berry. The hall is at one and the same time antechamber, salon, office, boudoir, and dining-room; it is the theatre of domestic life, the common living-room. There the barber of the neighborhood came, twice a year, to cut Monsieur Grandet’s hair; there the farmers, the cure, the under-prefect, and the miller’s boy came on business. This room, with two windows looking on the street, was entirely of wood. Gray panels with ancient mouldings covered the walls from top to bottom; the ceiling showed all its beams, which were likewise painted gray, while the space between them had been washed over in white, now yellow with age.

An old brass clock, inlaid with arabesques, adorned the mantel of the ill-cut white stone chimney-piece, above which was a greenish mirror, whose edges, bevelled to show the thickness of the glass, reflected a thread of light the whole length of a gothic frame in damascened steel-work. The two copper-gilt candelabra which decorated the corners of the chimney-piece served a double purpose:by taking off the side-branches, each of which held a socket, the main stem—which was fastened to a pedestal of bluish marble tipped with copper—made a candlestick for one candle, which was sufficient for ordinary occasions.

The chairs, antique in shape, were covered with tapestry representing the fables of La Fontaine; it was necessary, however, to know that writer well to guess at the subjects, for the faded colors and the figures, blurred by much darning, were difficult to distinguish.At the four corners of the hall were closets, or rather buffets, surmounted by dirty shelves. An old card-table in marquetry, of which the upper part was a chess-board, stood in the space between the two windows. Above this table was an oval barometer with a black border enlivened with gilt bands, on which the flies had so licentiously disported themselves that the gilding had become problematical.

On the panel opposite to the chimney-piece were two portraits in pastel, supposed to represent the grandfather of Madame Grandet, old Monsieur de la Bertelliere, as a lieutenant in the French guard, and the deceased Madame Gentillet in the guise of a shepherdess. The windows were draped with curtains of red gros de Tours held back by silken cords with ecclesiastical tassels. This luxurious decoration, little in keeping with the habits of Monsieur Grandet, had been, together with the steel pier-glass, the tapestries, and the buffets, which were of rose-wood, included in the purchase of the house.

By the window nearest to the door stood a straw chair, whose legs were raised on castors to lift its occupant, Madame Grandet, to a height from which she could see the passers-by. A work-table of stained cherry-wood filled up the embrasure, and the little armchair of Eugenie Grandet stood beside it.

In this spot the lives had flowed peacefully onward for fifteen years, in a round of constant work from the month of April to the month of November. On the first day of the latter month they took their winter station by the chimney. Not until that day did Grandet permit a fire to be lighted; and on the thirty-first of March it was extinguished, without regard either to the chills of the early spring or to those of a wintry autumn. A foot-warmer, filled with embers from the kitchen fire, which la Grande Nanon contrived to save for them, enabled Madame and Mademoiselle Grandet to bear the chilly mornings and evenings of April and October.

Mother and daughter took charge of the family linen, and spent their days so conscientiously upon a labor properly that of working-women, that if Eugenie wished to embroider a collar for her mother she was forced to take the time from sleep, and deceive her father to obtain the necessary light. For a long time the miser had given out the tallow candle to his daughter and la Grande Nanon just as he gave out every morning the bread and other necessaries for the daily consumption.

La Grande Nanon was perhaps the only human being capable of accepting willingly the despotism of her master. The whole town envied Monsieur and Madame Grandet the possession of her. La Grande Nanon, so called on account of her height, which was five feet eight inches, had lived with Monsieur Grandet for thirty-five years. Though she received only sixty francs a year in wages, she was supposed to be one of the richest serving-women in Saumur. Those sixty francs, accumulating through thirty-five years, had recently enabled her to invest four thousand francs in an annuity with Maitre Cruchot. This result of her long and persistent economy seemed gigantic. Every servant in the town, seeing that the poor sexagenarian was sure of bread for her old age, was jealous of her, and never thought of the hard slavery through which it had been won.

At twenty-two years of age the poor girl had been unable to find a situation, so repulsive was her face to almost every one. Yet the feeling was certainly unjust: the face would have been much admired on the shoulders of a grenadier of the guard; but all things, so they say, should be in keeping. Forced to leave a farm where she kept the cows, because the dwelling-house was burned down, she came to Saumur to find a place, full of the robust courage that shrinks from no labor.

Le Pere Grandet was at that time thinking of marriage and about to set up his household. He espied the girl, rejected as she was from door to door. A good judge of corporeal strength in his trade as a cooper, he guessed the work that might be got out of a female creature shaped like a Hercules, as firm on her feet as an oak sixty years old on its roots, strong in the hips, square in the back, with the hands of a cartman and an honesty as sound as her unblemished virtue. Neither the warts which adorned her martial visage, nor the red-brick tints of her skin, nor the sinewy arms, nor the ragged garments of la Grande Nanon, dismayed the cooper, who was at that time still of an age when the heart shudders. He fed, shod, and clothed the poor girl, gave her wages, and put her to work without treating her too roughly.

Seeing herself thus welcomed, la Grande Nanon wept secretly tears of joy, and attached herself in all sincerity to her master, who from that day ruled her and worked her with feudal authority. Nanon did everything. She cooked, she made the lye, she washed the linen in the Loire and brought it home on her shoulders; she got up early, she went to bed late; she prepared the food of the vine-dressers during the harvest, kept watch upon the market-people, protected the property of her master like a faithful dog, and even, full of blind confidence, obeyed without a murmur his most absurd exactions. In the famous year of 1811, when the grapes were gathered with unheard-of difficulties, Grandet resolved to give Nanon his old watch—the first present he had made her during twenty years of service. Though he turned over to her his old shoes (which fitted her), it is impossible to consider that quarterly benefit as a gift, for the shoes were always thoroughly worn-out. Necessity had made the poor girl so niggardly that Grandet had grown to love her as we love a dog, and Nanon had let him fasten a spiked collar round her throat, whose spikes no longer pricked her.

If Grandet cut the bread with rather too much parsimony, she made no complaint; she gaily shared the hygienic benefits derived from the severe regime of the household, in which no one was ever ill. Nanon was, in fact, one of the family; she laughed when Grandet laughed, felt gloomy or chilly, warmed herself, and toiled as he did. What pleasant compensations there were in such equality! Never did the master have occasion to find fault with the servant for pilfering the grapes, nor for the plums and nectarines eaten under the trees.

“Come, fall to, Nanon!” he would say in years when the branches bent under the fruit and the farmers were obliged to give it to the pigs.

To the poor peasant who in her youth had earned nothing but harsh treatment, to the pauper girl picked up by charity, Grandet’s ambiguous laugh was like a sunbeam. Moreover, Nanon’s simple heart and narrow head could hold only one feeling and one idea. For thirty-five years she had never ceased to see herself standing before the wood-yard of Monsieur Grandet, ragged and barefooted, and to hear him say: “What do you want, young one?” Her gratitude was ever new.

Sometimes Grandet, reflecting that the poor creature had never heard a flattering word, that she was ignorant of all the tender sentiments inspired by women, that she might some day appear before the throne of God even more chaste than the Virgin Mary herself—Grandet, struck with pity, would say as he looked at her,“Poor Nanon!”

The exclamation was always followed by an undefinable look cast upon him in return by the old servant. The words, uttered from time to time, formed a chain of friendship that nothing ever parted, and to which each exclamation added a link. Such compassion arising in the heart of the miser, and accepted gratefully by the old spinster, had something inconceivably horrible about it. This cruel pity, recalling, as it did, a thousand pleasures to the heart of the old cooper, was for Nanon the sum total of happiness. Who does not likewise say, “Poor Nanon!” God will recognize his angels by the inflexions of their voices and by their secret sighs.

There were very many households in Saumur where the servants were better treated, but where the masters received far less satisfaction in return. Thus it was often said: “What have the Grandets ever done to make their Grande Nanon so attached to them? She would go through fire and water for their sake!”

Her kitchen, whose barred windows looked into the court, was always clean, neat, cold—a true miser’s kitchen, where nothing went to waste. When Nanon had washed her dishes, locked up the remains of the dinner, and put out her fire, she left the kitchen, which was separated by a passage from the living-room, and went to spin hemp beside her masters. One tallow candle sufficed the family for the evening. The servant slept at the end of the passage in a species of closet lighted only by a fan-light. Her robust health enabled her to live in this hole with impunity; there she could hear the slightest noise through the deep silence which reigned night and day in that dreary house. Like a watch-dog, she slept with one ear open, and took her rest with a mind alert.

A description of the other parts of the dwelling will be found connected with the events of this history, though the foregoing sketch of the hall, where the whole luxury of the household appears, may enable the reader to surmise the nakedness of the upper floors.

In 1819, at the beginning of an evening in the middle of November, la Grande Nanon lighted the fire for the first time. The autumn had been very fine. This particular day was a fete-day well known to the Cruchotines and the Grassinists. The six antagonists, armed at all points, were making ready to meet at the Grandets and surpass each other in testimonials of friendship.

That morning all Saumur had seen Madame and Mademoiselle Grandet, accompanied by Nanon, on their way to hear Mass at the parish church, and every one remembered that the day was the anniversary of Mademoiselle Eugenie’s birth. Calculating the hour at which the family dinner would be over, Maitre Cruchot, the Abbe Cruchot, and Monsieur C. de Bonfons hastened to arrive before the des Grassins, and be the first to pay their compliments to Mademoiselle Eugenie. All three brought enormous bouquets, gathered in their little green-houses. The stalks of the flowers which the president intended to present were ingeniously wound round with a white satin ribbon adorned with gold fringe.

In the morning Monsieur Grandet, following his usual custom on the days that commemorated the birth and the fete of Eugenie, went to her bedside and solemnly presented her with his paternal gift—which for the last thirteen years had consisted regularly of a curious gold-piece.

Madame Grandet gave her daughter a winter dress or a summer dress, as the case might be. These two dresses and the gold-pieces, of which she received two others on New Year’s day and on her father’s fete-day, gave Eugenie a little revenue of a hundred crowns or thereabouts, which Grandet loved to see her amass. Was it not putting his money from one strong-box to another, and, as it were, training the parsimony of his heiress? from whom he sometimes demanded an account of her treasure (formerly increased by the gifts of the Bertellieres), saying: “It is to be your marriage dozen.”

The “marriage dozen” is an old custom sacredly preserved and still in force in many parts of central France. In Berry and in Anjou,when a young girl marries, her family, or that of the husband, must give her a purse, in which they place, according to their means, twelve pieces, or twelve dozen pieces, or twelve hundred pieces of gold. The poorest shepherd-girl never marries without her dozen, be it only a dozen coppers. They still tell in Issoudun of a certain“dozen” presented to a rich heiress, which contained a hundred and forty-four portugaises d’or. Pope Clement VII., uncle of Catherine de’ Medici, gave her when he married her to Henri II. a dozen antique gold medals of priceless value.

During dinner the father, delighted to see his Eugenie looking well in a new gown, exclaimed: “As it is Eugenie’s birthday let us have a fire; it will be a good omen.”

“Mademoiselle will be married this year, that’s certain,” said la Grande Nanon, carrying away the remains of the goose—the pheasant of tradesmen.

“I don’t see any one suitable for her in Saumur,” said Madame Grandet, glancing at her husband with a timid look which, considering her years, revealed the conjugal slavery under which the poor woman languished.

Grandet looked at his daughter and exclaimed gaily—

“She is twenty-three years old to-day, the child; we must soon begin to think of it.”

Eugenie and her mother silently exchanged a glance of intelligence.

Madame Grandet was a dry, thin woman, as yellow as a quince, awkward, slow, one of those women who are born to be down-trodden. She had big bones, a big nose, a big forehead, big eyes, and presented at first sight a vague resemblance to those mealy fruits that have neither savor nor succulence. Her teeth were black and few in number, her mouth was wrinkled, her chin long and pointed. She was an excellent woman, a true la Bertelliere. L’abbe Cruchot found occasional opportunity to tell her that she had not done ill;and she believed him. Angelic sweetness, the resignation of an insect tortured by children, a rare piety, a good heart, an unalterable equanimity of soul, made her universally pitied and respected.

Her husband never gave her more than six francs at a time for her personal expenses. Ridiculous as it may seem, this woman, who by her own fortune and her various inheritances brought Pere Grandet more than three hundred thousand francs, had always felt so profoundly humiliated by her dependence and the slavery in which she lived, against which the gentleness of her spirit prevented her from revolting, that she had never asked for one penny or made a single remark on the deeds which Maitre Cruchot brought for her signature. This foolish secret pride, this nobility of soul perpetually misunderstood and wounded by Grandet, ruled the whole conduct of the wife.

Madame Grandet was attired habitually in a gown of greenish levantine silk, endeavoring to make it last nearly a year; with it she wore a large kerchief of white cotton cloth, a bonnet made of plaited straws sewn together, and almost always a black-silk apron. As she seldom left the house she wore out very few shoes. She never asked anything for herself.

Grandet, seized with occasional remorse when he remembered how long a time had elapsed since he gave her the last six francs, always stipulated for the “wife’s pin-money” when he sold his yearly vintage. The four or five louis presented by the Belgian or the Dutchman who purchased the wine were the chief visible signs of Madame Grandet’s annual revenues.

But after she had received the five louis, her husband would often say to her, as though their purse were held in common: “Can you lend me a few sous?” and the poor woman, glad to be able to do something for a man whom her confessor held up to her as her lord and master, returned him in the course of the winter several crowns out of the “pin-money.”

When Grandet drew from his pocket the five-franc piece which he allowed monthly for the minor expenses—thread, needles, and toilet—of his daughter, he never failed to say as he buttoned his breeches’ pocket: “And you, mother, do you want anything?”

“My friend,” Madame Grandet would answer, moved by a sense of maternal dignity, “we will see about that later.”

Wasted dignity! Grandet thought himself very generous to his wife. Philosophers who meet the like of Nanon, of Madame Grandet, of Eugenie, have surely a right to say that irony is at the bottom of the ways of Providence.

After the dinner at which for the first time allusion had been made to Eugenie’s marriage, Nanon went to fetch a bottle of black-currant ratafia from Monsieur Grandet’s bed-chamber, and nearly fell as she came down the stairs.

“You great stupid!” said her master; “are you going to tumble about like other people, hey?”

“Monsieur, it was that step on your staircase which has given way.”

“She is right,” said Madame Grandet; “it ought to have been mended long ago. Yesterday Eugenie nearly twisted her ankle.”

“Here,” said Grandet to Nanon, seeing that she looked quite pale, “as it is Eugenie’s birthday, and you came near falling, take a little glass of ratafia to set you right.”

“Faith! I’ve earned it,” said Nanon; “most people would have broken the bottle; but I’d sooner have broken my elbow holding it up high.”

“Poor Nanon!” said Grandet, filling a glass.

“Did you hurt yourself?” asked Eugenie, looking kindly at her.

“No, I didn’t fall; I threw myself back on my haunches.”

“Well! as it is Eugenie’s birthday,” said Grandet, “I’ll have the step mended. You people don’t know how to set your foot in the corner where the wood is still firm.”

Grandet took the candle, leaving his wife, daughter, and servant without any other light than that from the hearth, where the flames were lively, and went into the bakehouse to fetch planks, nails, and tools.

“Can I help you?” cried Nanon, hearing him hammer on the stairs.

“No, no! I’m an old hand at it,” answered the former cooper.

At the moment when Grandet was mending his worm-eaten staircase and whistling with all his might, in remembrance of the days of his youth, the three Cruchots knocked at the door.

“Is it you, Monsieur Cruchot?” asked Nanon, peeping through the little grating.

“Yes,” answered the president.

Nanon opened the door, and the light from the hearth, reflected on the ceiling, enabled the three Cruchots to find their way into the room.

“Ha! you’ve come a-greeting,” said Nanon, smelling the flowers.

“Excuse me, messieurs,” cried Grandet, recognizing their voices; “I’ll be with you in a moment. I’m not proud; I am patching up a step on my staircase.”

“Go on, go on, Monsieur Grandet; a man’s house is his castle,”said the president sententiously.

Madame and Mademoiselle Grandet rose. The president, profiting by the darkness, said to Eugenie:

“Will you permit me, mademoiselle, to wish you, on this the day of your birth, a series of happy years and the continuance of the health which you now enjoy?”

He offered her a huge bouquet of choice flowers which were rare in Saumur; then, taking the heiress by the elbows, he kissed her on each side of her neck with a complacency that made her blush. The president, who looked like a rusty iron nail, felt that his courtship was progressing.

“Don’t stand on ceremony,” said Grandet, entering. “How well you do things on fete-days, Monsieur le president!”

“When it concerns mademoiselle,” said the abbe, armed with his own bouquet, “every day is a fete-day for my nephew.”

The abbe kissed Eugenie’s hand. As for Maitre Cruchot, he boldly kissed her on both cheeks, remarking: “How we sprout up, to be sure! Every year is twelve months.”

As he replaced the candlestick beside the clock, Grandet, who never forgot his own jokes, and repeated them to satiety when he thought them funny, said—

“As this is Eugenie’s birthday let us illuminate.”

He carefully took off the branches of the candelabra, put a socket on each pedestal, took from Nanon a new tallow candle with paper twisted round the end of it, put it into the hollow, made it firm, lit it, and then sat down beside his wife, looking alternately at his friends, his daughter, and the two candles. The Abbe Cruchot, a plump, puffy little man, with a red wig plastered down and a face like an old female gambler, said as he stretched out his feet, well shod in stout shoes with silver buckles: “The des Grassins have not come?”

“Not yet,” said Grandet.

“But are they coming?” asked the old notary, twisting his face, which had as many holes as a collander, into a queer grimace.

“I think so,” answered Madame Grandet.

“Are your vintages all finished?” said Monsieur de Bonfons to Grandet.

“Yes, all of them,” said the old man, rising to walk up and down the room, his chest swelling with pride as he said the words, “all of them.”

Through the door of the passage which led to the kitchen he saw la Grande Nanon sitting beside her fire with a candle and preparing to spin there, so as not to intrude among the guests.

“Nanon,” he said, going into the passage, “put out that fire and that candle, and come and sit with us. Pardieu! the hall is big enough for all.”

“But monsieur, you are to have the great people.”

“Are not you as good as they? They are descended from Adam, and so are you.”

Grandet came back to the president and said—

“Have you sold your vintage?”

“No, not I; I shall keep it. If the wine is good this year, it will be better two years hence. The proprietors, you know, have made an agreement to keep up the price; and this year the Belgians won’t get the better of us. Suppose they are sent off empty-handed for once, faith! they’ll come back.”

“Yes, but let us mind what we are about,” said Grandet in a tone which made the president tremble.

“Is he driving some bargain?” thought Cruchot.

At this moment the knocker announced the des Grassins family, and their arrival interrupted a conversation which had begun between Madame Grandet and the abbe.

Madame des Grassins was one of those lively, plump little women, with pink-and-white skins, who, thanks to the claustral calm of the provinces and the habits of a virtuous life, keep their youth until they are past forty. She was like the last rose of autumn—pleasant to the eye, though the petals have a certain frostiness, and their perfume is slight. She dressed well, got her fashions from Paris, set the tone to Saumur, and gave parties.

Her husband, formerly a quartermaster in the Imperial guard, who had been desperately wounded at Austerlitz, and had since retired, still retained, in spite of his respect for Grandet, the seeming frankness of an old soldier.

“Good evening, Grandet,” he said, holding out his hand and affecting a sort of superiority, with which he always crushed the Cruchots. “Mademoiselle,” he added, turning to Eugenie, after bowing to Madame Grandet, “you are always beautiful and good, and truly I do not know what to wish you.”

So saying, he offered her a little box which his servant had brought and which contained a Cape heather—a flower lately imported into Europe and very rare.

Madame des Grassins kissed Eugenie very affectionately, pressed her hand, and said: “Adolphe wishes to make you my little offering.”

A tall, blond young man, pale and slight, with tolerable manners and seemingly rather shy, although he had just spent eight or ten thousand francs over his allowance in Paris, where he had been sent to study law, now came forward and kissed Eugenie on both cheeks, offering her a workbox with utensils in silver-gilt—mere show-case trumpery, in spite of the monogram E.G. in gothic letters rather well engraved, which belonged properly to something in better taste.

As she opened it, Eugenie experienced one of those unexpected and perfect delights which make a young girl blush and quiver and tremble with pleasure. She turned her eyes to her father as if to ask permission to accept it, and Monsieur Grandet replied: “Take it, my daughter,” in a tone which would have made an actor illustrious.

The three Cruchots felt crushed as they saw the joyous, animated look cast upon Adolphe des Grassins by the heiress, to whom such riches were unheard-of. Monsieur des Grassins offered Grandet a pinch of snuff, took one himself, shook off the grains as they fell on the ribbon of the Legion of honor which was attached to the button-hole of his blue surtout; then he looked at the Cruchots with an air that seemed to say, “Parry that thrust if you can!”

Madame des Grassins cast her eyes on the blue vases which held the Cruchot bouquets, looking at the enemy’s gifts with the pretended interest of a satirical woman. At this delicate juncture the Abbe Cruchot left the company seated in a circle round the fire and joined Grandet at the lower end of the hall. As the two men reached the embrasure of the farthest window the priest said in the miser’s ear: “Those people throw money out of the windows.”

“What does that matter if it gets into my cellar?” retorted the old wine-grower.

“If you want to give gilt scissors to your daughter, you have the means,” said the abbe.

“I give her something better than scissors,” answered Grandet.

“My nephew is a blockhead,” thought the abbe as he looked at the president, whose rumpled hair added to the ill grace of his brown countenance. “Couldn’t he have found some little trifle which cost money?”

“We will join you at cards, Madame Grandet,” said Madame des Grassins.

“We might have two tables, as we are all here.”

“As it is Eugenie’s birthday you had better play loto all together,” said Pere Grandet: “the two young ones can join”; and the old cooper, who never played any game, motioned to his daughter and Adolphe. “Come, Nanon, set the tables.”

“We will help you, Mademoiselle Nanon,” said Madame des Grassins gaily, quite joyous at the joy she had given Eugenie.

“I have never in my life been so pleased,” the heiress said to her; “I have never seen anything so pretty.”

“Adolphe brought it from Paris, and he chose it,” Madame des Grassins whispered in her ear.

“Go on! go on! damned intriguing thing!” thought the president.“If you ever have a suit in court, you or your husband, it shall go hard with you.”

The notary, sitting in his corner, looked calmly at the abbe, saying to himself: “The des Grassins may do what they like; my property and my brother’s and that of my nephew amount in all to eleven hundred thousand francs. The des Grassins, at the most, have not half that; besides, they have a daughter. They may give what presents they like; heiress and presents too will be ours one of these days.”

At half-past eight in the evening the two card-tables were set out. Madame des Grassins succeeded in putting her son beside Eugenie. The actors in this scene, so full of interest, commonplace as it seems, were provided with bits of pasteboard striped in many colors and numbered, and with counters of blue glass, and they appeared to be listening to the jokes of the notary, who never drew a number without making a remark, while in fact they were all thinking of Monsieur Grandet’s millions.

The old cooper, with inward self-conceit, was contemplating the pink feathers and the fresh toilet of Madame des Grassins, the martial head of the banker, the faces of Adolphe, the president, the abbe, and the notary, saying to himself—

“They are all after my money. Hey! neither the one nor the other shall have my daughter; but they are useful—useful as harpoons to fish with.”

This family gaiety in the old gray room dimly lighted by two tallow candles; this laughter, accompanied by the whirr of Nanon’s spinning-wheel, sincere only upon the lips of Eugenie or her mother;this triviality mingled with important interests; this young girl, who, like certain birds made victims of the price put upon them, was now lured and trapped by proofs of friendship of which she was the dupe—all these things contributed to make the scene a melancholy comedy. Is it not, moreover, a drama of all times and all places, though here brought down to its simplest expression? The figure of Grandet, playing his own game with the false friendship of the two families and getting enormous profits from it, dominates the scene and throws light upon it. The modern god—the only god in whom faith is preserved—money, is here, in all its power, manifested in a single countenance.

The tender sentiments of life hold here but a secondary place;only the three pure, simple hearts of Nanon, of Eugenie, and of her mother were inspired by them. And how much of ignorance there was in the simplicity of these poor women! Eugenie and her mother knew nothing of Grandet’s wealth; they could only estimate the things of life by the glimmer of their pale ideas, and they neither valued nor despised money, because they were accustomed to do without it. Their feelings, bruised, though they did not know it,but ever-living, were the secret spring of their existence, and made them curious exceptions in the midst of these other people whose lives were purely material. Frightful condition of the human race! there is no one of its joys that does not come from some species of ignorance.

At the moment when Madame Grandet had won a loto of sixteen sous—the largest ever pooled in that house—and while la Grande Nanon was laughing with delight as she watched madame pocketing her riches, the knocker resounded on the house-door with such a noise that the women all jumped in their chairs.

“There is no man in Saumur who would knock like that,” said the notary.

“How can they bang in that way!” exclaimed Nanon; “Do they want to break in the door?”

“Who the devil is it?” cried Grandet.

Nanon took one of the candles and went to open the door, followed by her master.

“Grandet! Grandet!” cried his wife, moved by a sudden impulse of fear, and running to the door of the room.

All the players looked at each other.

“Suppose we all go?” said Monsieur des Grassins; “that knock strikes me as evil-intentioned.”

Hardly was Monsieur des Grassins allowed to see the figure of a young man, accompanied by a porter from the coach-office carrying two large trunks and dragging a carpet-bag after him, than Monsieur Grandet turned roughly on his wife and said—

“Madame Grandet, go back to your loto; leave me to speak with monsieur.”

Then he pulled the door quickly to, and the excited players returned to their seats, but did not continue the game.

“Is it any one belonging to Saumur, Monsieur des Grassins?”asked his wife.

“No. He is a traveller.”

“He must have come from Paris.”

“Just so,” said the notary, pulling out his watch, which was two inches thick and looked like a Dutch man-of-war; “it’s nine o’clock;the diligence of the Grand Bureau is never late.”

“Is the gentleman young?” inquired the Abbe Cruchot.

“Yes,” answered Monsieur des Grassins, “and he has brought luggage which must weigh nearly three tons.”

“Nanon does not come back,” said Eugenie.

“It must be one of your relations,” remarked the president.

“Let us go on with our game,” said Madame Grandet gently.“I know from Monsieur Grandet’s tone of voice that he is annoyed;perhaps he would not like to find us talking of his affairs.”

“Mademoiselle,” said Adolphe to his neighbor, “it is no doubt your cousin Grandet—a very good-looking young man; I met him at the ball of Monsieur de Nucingen.”

Adolphe did not go on, for his mother trod on his toes; and then, asking him aloud for two sous to put on her stake, she whispered:“Will you hold your tongue, you great goose!”

At this moment Grandet returned, without la Grande Nanon, whose steps, together with those of the porter, echoed up the staircase; and he was followed by the traveller who had excited such curiosity and so filled the lively imaginations of those present that his arrival at this dwelling, and his sudden fall into the midst of this assembly, can only be likened to that of a snail into a beehive, or the introduction of a peacock into some village poultry-yard.

“Sit down near the fire,” said Grandet.

Before seating himself, the young stranger saluted the assembled company very gracefully. The men rose to answer by a courteous inclination, and the women made a ceremonious bow.

“You are cold, no doubt, monsieur,” said Madame Grandet; “you have, perhaps, travelled from—”

“Just like all women!” said the old wine-grower, looking up from a letter he was reading. “Do let monsieur rest himself!”

“But, father, perhaps monsieur would like to take something,”said Eugenie.

“He has got a tongue,” said the old man sternly.

The stranger was the only person surprised by this scene; all the others were well-used to the despotic ways of the master. However, after the two questions and the two replies had been exchanged, the newcomer rose, turned his back towards the fire, lifted one foot so as to warm the sole of its boot, and said to Eugenie—

“Thank you, my cousin, but I dined at Tours. And,” he added, looking at Grandet, “I need nothing; I am not even tired.”

“Monsieur has come from the capital?” asked Madame des Grassins.

Monsieur Charles—such was the name of the son of Monsieur Grandet of Paris—hearing himself addressed, took a little eye-glass, suspended by a chain from his neck, applied it to his right eye to examine what was on the table, and also the persons sitting round it. He ogled Madame des Grassins with much impertinence, and said to her, after he had observed all he wished—

“Yes, madame. You are playing at loto, aunt,” he added. “Do not let me interrupt you, I beg; go on with your game: it is too amusing to leave.”

“I was certain it was the cousin,” thought Madame des Grassins, casting repeated glances at him.

“Forty-seven!” cried the old abbe. “Mark it down, Madame des Grassins. Isn’t that your number?”

Monsieur des Grassins put a counter on his wife’s card, who sat watching first the cousin from Paris and then Eugenie, without thinking of her loto, a prey to mournful presentiments. From time to time the young heiress glanced furtively at her cousin, and the banker’s wife easily detected acrescendo of surprise and curiosity in her mind.





II


Monsieur Charles Grandet, a handsome young man of twenty-two, presented at this moment a singular contrast to the worthy provincials, who, considerably disgusted by his aristocratic manners, were all studying him with sarcastic intent. This needs an explanation.

At twenty-two, young people are still so near childhood that they often conduct themselves childishly. In all probability, out of every hundred of them fully ninety-nine would have behaved precisely as Monsieur Charles Grandet was now behaving.

Some days earlier than this his father had told him to go and spend several months with his uncle at Saumur. Perhaps Monsieur Grandet was thinking of Eugenie. Charles, sent for the first time in his life into the provinces, took a fancy to make his appearance with the superiority of a man of fashion, to reduce the whole arrondissement to despair by his luxury, and to make his visit an epoch, importing into those country regions all the refinements of Parisian life. In short, to explain it in one word, he mean to pass more time at Saumur in brushing his nails than he ever thought of doing in Paris, and to assume the extra nicety and elegance of dress which a young man of fashion often lays aside for a certain negligence which in itself is not devoid of grace.

Charles therefore brought with him a complete hunting-costume, the finest gun, the best hunting-knife in the prettiest sheath to be found in all Paris. He brought his whole collection of waistcoats. They were of all kinds—gray, black, white, scarabaeus-colored:some were shot with gold, some spangled, somechined; some were double-breasted and crossed like a shawl, others were straight in the collar; some had turned-over collars, some buttoned up to the top with gilt buttons. He brought every variety of collar and cravat in fashion at that epoch. He brought two of Buisson’s coats and all his finest linens. He brought his pretty gold toilet-set—a present from his mother. He brought all his dandy knick-knacks, not forgetting a ravishing little desk presented to him by the most amiable of women—amiable for him, at least—a fine lady whom he called Annette and who at this moment was travelling, matrimonially and wearily, in Scotland, a victim to certain suspicions which required a passing sacrifice of happiness; in the desk was much pretty note-paper on which to write to her once a fortnight. In short, it was as complete a cargo of Parisian frivolities as it was possible for him to get together—a collection of all the implements of husbandry with which the youth of leisure tills his life, from the little whip which helps to begin a duel, to the handsomely chased pistols which end it. His father having told him to travel alone and modestly, he had taken the coupe of the diligence all to himself, rather pleased at not having to damage a delightful travelling-carriage ordered for a journey on which he was to meet his Annette, the great lady who, etc.—whom he intended to rejoin at Baden in the following June.

Charles expected to meet scores of people at his uncle’s house, to hunt in his uncle’s forests—to live, in short, the usual chateau life;he did not know that his uncle was in Saumur, and had only inquired about him incidentally when asking the way to Froidfond. Hearing that he was in town, he supposed that he should find him in a suitable mansion.In order that he might make a becoming first appearance before his uncle either at Saumur or at Froidfond, he had put on his most elegant travelling attire, simple yet exquisite—“adorable,” to use the word which in those days summed up the special perfections of a man or a thing. At Tours a hairdresser had re-curled his beautiful chestnut locks; there he changed his linen and put on a black satin cravat, which, combined with a round shirt-collar, framed his fair and smiling countenance agreeably. A travelling great-coat, only half buttoned up, nipped in his waist and disclosed a cashmere waistcoat crossed in front, beneath which was another waistcoat of white material. His watch, negligently slipped into a pocket, was fastened by a short gold chain to a buttonhole. His gray trousers, buttoned up at the sides, were set off at the seams with patterns of black silk embroidery. He gracefully twirled a cane, whose chased gold knob did not mar the freshness of his gray gloves. And to complete all, his cap was in excellent taste.

None but a Parisian, and a Parisian of the upper spheres, could thus array himself without appearing ridiculous; none other could give the harmony of self-conceit to all these fopperies, which were carried off, however, with a dashing air—the air of a young man who has fine pistols, a sure aim, and Annette.

Now if you wish to understand the mutual amazement of the provincial party and the young Parisian; if you would clearly see the brilliance which the traveller’s elegance cast among the gray shadows of the room and upon the faces of this family group—endeavor to picture to your minds the Cruchots. All three took snuff, and had long ceased to repress the habit of snivelling or to remove the brown blotches which strewed the frills of their dingy shirts and the yellowing creases of their crumpled collars. Their flabby cravats were twisted into ropes as soon as they wound them about their throats. The enormous quantity of linen which allowed these people to have their clothing washed only once in six months, and to keep it during that time in the depths of their closets, also enabled time to lay its grimy and decaying stains upon it. There was perfect unison of ill-grace and senility about them; their faces, as faded as their threadbare coats, as creased as their trousers, were worn-out, shrivelled-up, and puckered.

As for the others, the general negligence of their dress, which was incomplete and wanting in freshness—like the toilet of all country places, where insensibly people cease to dress for others and come to think seriously of the price of a pair of gloves—was in keeping with the negligence of the Cruchots. A horror of fashion was the only point on which the Grassinists and the Cruchotines agreed. When the Parisian took up his eye-glass to examine the strange accessories of this dwelling—the joists of the ceiling, the color of the woodwork, and the specks which the flies had left there in sufficient number to punctuate the “Moniteur” and the “Encyclopaedia of Sciences,”—the loto-players lifted their noses and looked at him with as much curiosity as they might have felt about a giraffe. Monsieur des Grassins and his son, to whom the appearance of a man of fashion was not wholly unknown, were nevertheless as much astonished as their neighbors, whether it was that they fell under the indefinable influence of the general feeling, or that they really shared it as with satirical glances they seemed to say to their compatriots—

“That is what you see in Paris!”

They were able to examine Charles at their leisure without fearing to displease the master of the house. Grandet was absorbed in the long letter which he held in his hand; and to read it he had taken the only candle upon the card-table, paying no heed to his guests or their pleasure. Eugenie, to whom such a type of perfection, whether of dress or of person, was absolutely unknown, thought she beheld in her cousin a being descended from seraphic spheres. She inhaled with delight the fragrance wafted from the graceful curls of that brilliant head. She would have liked to touch the soft kid of the delicate gloves. She envied Charles his small hands, his complexion, the freshness and refinement of his features. In short, if it is possible to sum up the effect this elegant being produced upon an ignorant young girl perpetually employed in darning stockings or in mending her father’s clothes, and whose life flowed on beneath these unclean rafters, seeing none but occasional passers along the silent street—this vision of her cousin roused in her soul an emotion of delicate desire like that inspired in a young man by the fanciful pictures of women drawn by Westall for the English “Keepsakes,” and that engraved by the Findens with so clever a tool that we fear, as we breathe upon the paper, that the celestial apparitions may be wafted away.

Charles drew from his pocket a handkerchief embroidered by the great lady now travelling in Scotland. As Eugenie saw this pretty piece of work, done in the vacant hours which were lost to love, she looked at her cousin to see if it were possible that he meant to make use of it. The manners of the young man, his gestures, the way in which he took up his eye-glass, his affected superciliousness, his contemptuous glance at the coffer which had just given so much pleasure to the rich heiress, and which he evidently regarded as without value, or even as ridiculous—all these things, which shocked the Cruchots and the des Grassins, pleased Eugenie so deeply that before she slept she dreamed long dreams of her phoenix cousin.

The loto-numbers were drawn very slowly, and presently the game came suddenly to an end. La Grand Nanon entered and said aloud: “Madame, I want the sheets for monsieur’s bed.”

Madame Grandet followed her out. Madame des Grassins said in a low voice: “Let us keep our sous and stop playing.”

Each took his or her two sous from the chipped saucer in which they had been put; then the party moved in a body toward the fire.

“Have you finished your game?” said Grandet, without looking up from his letter.

“Yes, yes!” replied Madame des Grassins, taking a seat near Charles. Eugenie, prompted by a thought often born in the heart of a young girl when sentiment enters it for the first time, left the room to go and help her mother and Nanon. Had an able confessor then questioned her she would, no doubt, have avowed to him that she thought neither of her mother nor of Nanon, but was pricked by a poignant desire to look after her cousin’s room and concern herself with her cousin; to supply what might be needed, to remedy any forgetfulness, to see that all was done to make it, as far as possible, suitable and elegant; and, in fact, she arrived in time to prove to her mother and Nanon that everything still remained to be done. She put into Nanon’s head the notion of passing a warming-pan between the sheets. She herself covered the old table with a cloth and requested Nanon to change it every morning; she convinced her mother that it was necessary to light a good fire, and persuaded Nanon to bring up a great pile of wood into the corridor without saying anything to her father. She ran to get, from one of the corner-shelves of the hall, a tray of old lacquer which was part of the inheritance of the late Monsieur de la Bertelliere, catching up at the same time a six-sided crystal goblet, a little tarnished gilt spoon, an antique flask engraved with cupids, all of which she put triumphantly on the corner of her cousin’s chimney-piece. More ideas surged through her head in one quarter of an hour than she had ever had since she came into the world.

“Mamma,” she said, “my cousin will never bear the smell of a tallow candle; suppose we buy a wax one?” And she darted, swift as a bird, to get the five-franc piece which she had just received for her monthly expenses. “Here, Nanon,” she cried, “quick!”

“What will your father say?” This terrible remonstrance was uttered by Madame Grandet as she beheld her daughter armed with an old Sevres sugar-basin which Grandet had brought home from the chateau of Froidfond.

“And where will you get the sugar? Are you crazy?”

“Mamma, Nanon can buy some sugar as well as the candle.”

“But your father?”

“Surely his nephew ought not to go without a glass of eau sucree? Besides, he will not notice it.”

“Your father sees everything,” said Madame Grandet, shaking her head.

Nanon hesitated; she knew her master.

“Come, Nanon, go—because it is my birthday.”

Nanon gave a loud laugh as she heard the first little jest her young mistress had ever made, and then obeyed her.

While Eugenie and her mother were trying to embellish the bedroom assigned by Monsieur Grandet for his nephew, Charles himself was the object of Madame des Grassins’ attentions; to all appearances she was setting her cap at him.

“You are very courageous, monsieur,” she said to the young dandy, “to leave the pleasures of the capital at this season and take up your abode in Saumur. But if we do not frighten you away, you will find there are some amusements even here.”

She threw him the ogling glance of the provinces, where women put so much prudence and reserve into their eyes that they impart to them the prudish concupiscence peculiar to certain ecclesiastics to whom all pleasure is either a theft or an error.

Charles was so completely out of his element in this abode, and so far from the vast chateau and the sumptuous life with which his fancy had endowed his uncle, that as he looked at Madame des Grassins he perceived a dim likeness to Parisian faces. He gracefully responded to the species of invitation addressed to him, and began very naturally a conversation, in which Madame des Grassins gradually lowered her voice so as to bring it into harmony with the nature of the confidences she was making. With her, as with Charles, there was the need of conference; so after a few moments spent in coquettish phrases and a little serious jesting, the clever provincial said, thinking herself unheard by the others, who were discussing the sale of wines which at that season filled the heads of every one in Saumur—

“Monsieur if you will do us the honor to come and see us, you will give as much pleasure to my husband as to myself. Our salon is the only one in Saumur where you will find the higher business circles mingling with the nobility. We belong to both societies, who meet at our house simply because they find it amusing. My husband—I say it with pride—is as much valued by the one class as by the other. We will try to relieve the monotony of your visit here. If you stay all the time with Monsieur Grandet, good heavens! what will become of you? Your uncle is a sordid miser who thinks of nothing but his vines; your aunt is a pious soul who can’t put two ideas together; and your cousin is a little fool, without education, perfectly common, no fortune, who will spend her life in darning towels.”

“She is really very nice, this woman,” thought Charles Grandet as he duly responded to Madame des Grassins’ coquetries.

“It seems to me, wife, that you are taking possession of monsieur,” said the stout banker, laughing.

On this remark the notary and the president said a few words that were more or less significant; but the abbe, looking at them slyly, brought their thoughts to a focus by taking a pinch of snuff and saying as he handed round his snuff-box: “Who can do the honors of Saumur for monsieur so well as madame?”

“Ah! What do you mean by that, monsieur l’abbe?” demanded Monsieur des Grassins.

“I mean it in the best possible sense for you, for madame, for the town of Saumur, and for monsieur,” said the wily old man, turning to Charles.

The Abbe Cruchot had guessed the conversation between Charles and Madame des Grassins without seeming to pay attention to it.

“Monsieur,” said Adolphe to Charles with an air which he tried to make free and easy, “I don’t know whether you remember me, but I had the honor of dancing as your vis-a-vis at a ball given by the Baron de Nucingen, and—”

“Perfectly; I remember perfectly, monsieur,” answered Charles, pleased to find himself the object of general attention.

“Monsieur is your son?” he said to Madame des Grassins.

The abbe looked at her maliciously.

“Yes, monsieur,” she answered.

“Then you were very young when you were in Paris?” said Charles, addressing Adolphe.

“You must know, monsieur,” said the abbe, “that we send them to Babylon as soon as they are weaned.”

Madame des Grassins examined the abbe with a glance of extreme penetration.

“It is only in the provinces,” he continued, “that you will find women of thirty and more years as fresh as madame, here, with a son about to take his degree. I almost fancy myself back in the days when the young men stood on chairs in the ball-room to see you dance, madame,” said the abbe, turning to his female adversary. “To me, your triumphs are but of yesterday—”

“The old rogue!” thought Madame Grassins; “can he have guessed my intentions?”

“It seems that I shall have a good deal of success in Saumur,”thought Charles as he unbuttoned his great-coat, put a hand into his waistcoat, and cast a glance into the far distance, to imitate the attitude which Chantrey has given to Lord Byron.

The inattention of Pere Grandet, or, to speak more truly, the preoccupation of mind into which the reading of the letter had plunged him, did not escape the vigilance of the notary and the president, who tried to guess the contents of the letter by the almost imperceptible motions of the miser’s face, which was then under the full light of the candle. He maintained the habitual calm of his features with evident difficulty; we may, in fact, picture to ourselves the countenance such a man endeavored to preserve as he read the fatal letter which here follows—

My Brother—It is almost twenty-three years since we have seen each other. My marriage was the occasion of our last interview, after which we parted, and both of us were happy. Assuredly I could not then foresee that you would one day be the prop of the family whose prosperity you then predicted.When you hold this letter within your hands I shall be no longer living. In the position I now hold I cannot survive the disgrace of bankruptcy. I have waited on the edge of the gulf until the last moment, hoping to save myself. The end has come, I must sink into it. The double bankruptcies of my broker and of Roguin, my notary, have carried off my last resources and left me nothing. I have the bitterness of owing nearly four millions, with assets not more than twenty-five per cent in value to pay them. The wines in my warehouses suffer from the fall in prices caused by the abundance and quality of your vintage. In three days Paris will cry out: “Monsieur Grandet was a knave!”and I, an honest man, shall be lying in my winding-sheet of infamy. I deprive my son of a good name, which I have stained, and the fortune of his mother, which I have lost. He knows nothing of all this—my unfortunate child whom I idolize! We parted tenderly. He was ignorant, happily, that the last beatings of my heart were spent in that farewell. Will he not some day curse me? My brother, my brother! The curses of our children are horrible; they can appeal against ours, but theirs are irrevocable. Grandet, you are my elder brother, you owe me your protection; act for me so that Charles may cast no bitter words upon my grave! My brother, if I were writing with my blood, with my tears, no greater anguish could I put into this letter—nor as great, for then I should weep, I should bleed, I should die, I should suffer no more, but now I suffer and look at death with dry eyes.From henceforth you are my son’s father; he has no relations, as you well know, on his mother’s side. Why did I not consider social prejudices? Why did I yield to love? Why did I marry the natural daughter of a great lord? Charles has no family. Oh, my unhappy son! my son! Listen, Grandet! I implore nothing for myself—besides, your property may not be large enough to carry a mortgage of three millions—but for my son! Brother, my suppliant hands are clasped as I think of you; behold them! Grandet, I confide my son to you in dying, and I look at the means of death with less pain as I think that you will be to him a father. He loved me well, my Charles; I was good to him, I never thwarted him; he will not curse me. Ah, you see! he is gentle, he is like his mother, he will cause you no grief. Poor boy! accustomed to all the enjoyments of luxury, he knows nothing of the privations to which you and I were condemned by the poverty of our youth. And I leave him ruined! alone! Yes, all my friends will avoid him, and it is I who have brought this humiliation upon him! Would that I had the force to send him with one thrust into the heavens to his mother’s side! Madness! I come back to my disaster—to his. I send him to you that you may tell him in some fitting way of my death, of his future fate. Be a father to him, but a good father. Do not tear him all at once from his idle life, it would kill him. I beg him on my knees to renounce all rights that, as his mother’s heir, he may have on my estate. But the prayer is superfluous;he is honorable, and he will feel that he must not appear among my creditors. Bring him to see this at the right time;reveal to him the hard conditions of the life I have made for him: and if he still has tender thoughts of me, tell him in my name that all is not lost for him. Yes, work, labor, which saved us both, may give him back the fortune of which I have deprived him; and if he listens to his father’s voice as it reaches him from the grave, he will go the Indies. My brother, Charles is an upright and courageous young man; give him the wherewithal to make his venture;he will die sooner than not repay you the funds which you may lend him. Grandet! if you will not do this, you will lay up for yourself remorse. Ah, should my child find neither tenderness nor succor in you, I would call down the vengeance of God upon your cruelty!If I had been able to save something from the wreck, I might have had the right to leave him at least a portion of his mother’s property;but my last monthly payments have absorbed everything. I did not wish to die uncertain of my child’s fate; I hoped to feel a sacred promise in a clasp of your hand which might have warmed my heart: but time fails me. While Charles is journeying to you I shall be preparing my assignment. I shall endeavor to show by the order and good faith of my accounts that my disaster comes neither from a faulty life nor from dishonesty. It is for my son’s sake that I strive to do this.Farewell, my brother! May the blessing of God be yours for the generous guardianship I lay upon you, and which, I doubt not, you will accept. A voice will henceforth and forever pray for you in that world where we must all go, and where I am now as you read these lines.

Victor-Ange-Guillaume Grandet.

“So you are talking?” said Pere Grandet as he carefully folded the letter in its original creases and put it into his waistcoat-pocket.

He looked at his nephew with a humble, timid air, beneath which he hid his feelings and his calculations. “Have you warmed yourself?” he said to him.

“Thoroughly, my dear uncle.”

“Well, where are the women?” said his uncle, already forgetting that his nephew was to sleep at the house.

At this moment Eugenie and Madame Grandet returned.

“Is the room all ready?” said Grandet, recovering his composure.

“Yes, father.”

“Well then, my nephew, if you are tired, Nanon shall show you your room. It isn’t a dandy’s room; but you will excuse a poor wine-grower who never has a penny to spare. Taxes swallow up everything.”

“We do not wish to intrude, Grandet,” said the banker; “you may want to talk to your nephew, and therefore we will bid you good-night.”

At these words the assembly rose, and each made a parting bow in keeping with his or her own character. The old notary went to the door to fetch his lantern and came back to light it, offering to accompany the des Grassins on their way. Madame des Grassins had not foreseen the incident which brought the evening prematurely to an end, her servant therefore had not arrived.

“Will you do me the honor to take my arm, madame?” said the abbe.

“Thank you, monsieur l’abbe, but I have my son,” she answered dryly.

“Ladies cannot compromise themselves with me,” said the abbe.

“Take Monsieur Cruchot’s arm,” said her husband.

The abbe walked off with the pretty lady so quickly that they were soon some distance in advance of the caravan.

“That is a good-looking young man, madame,” he said, pressing her arm. “Good-bye to the grapes, the vintage is done. It is all over with us. We may as well say adieu to Mademoiselle Grandet. Eugenie will belong to the dandy. Unless this cousin is enamoured of some Parisian woman, your son Adolphe will find another rival in—”

“Not at all, monsieur l’abbe. This young man cannot fail to see that Eugenie is a little fool—a girl without the least freshness. Did you notice her to-night? She was as yellow as a quince.”

“Perhaps you made the cousin notice it?”

“I did not take the trouble—”

“Place yourself always beside Eugenie, madame, and you need never take the trouble to say anything to the young man against his cousin; he will make his own comparisons, which—”

“Well, he has promised to dine with me the day after to-morrow.”

“Ah! if you only would, madame—” said the abbe.

“What is it that you wish me to do, monsieur l’abbe? Do you mean to offer me bad advice? I have not reached the age of thirty-nine, without a stain upon my reputation, thank God! to compromise myself now, even for the empire of the Great Mogul. You and I are of an age when we both know the meaning of words. For an ecclesiastic, you certainly have ideas that are very incongruous. Fie! it is worthy of Faublas!”

“You have read Faublas?”

“No, monsieur l’abbe; I meant to say the Liaisons dangereuses.”

“Ah! that book is infinitely more moral,” said the abbe, laughing. “But you make me out as wicked as a young man of the present day; I only meant—”

“Do you dare to tell me you were not thinking of putting wicked things into my head? Isn’t it perfectly clear? If this young man—who I admit is very good-looking—were to make love to me, he would not think of his cousin. In Paris, I know, good mothers do devote themselves in this way to the happiness and welfare of their children; but we live in the provinces, monsieur l’abbe.”

“Yes, madame.”

“And,” she continued, “I do not want, and Adolphe himself would not want, a hundred millions brought at such a price.”

“Madame, I said nothing about a hundred millions; that temptation might be too great for either of us to withstand. Only, I do think that an honest woman may permit herself, in all honor, certain harmless little coquetries, which are, in fact, part of her social duty and which—”

“Do you think so?”

“Are we not bound, madame, to make ourselves agreeable to each other?—Permit me to blow my nose.—I assure you, madame,”he resumed, “that the young gentleman ogled you through his glass in a more flattering manner than he put on when he looked at me;but I forgive him for doing homage to beauty in preference to old age—”

“It is quite apparent,” said the president in his loud voice,“that Monsieur Grandet of Paris has sent his son to Saumur with extremely matrimonial intentions.”

“But in that case the cousin wouldn’t have fallen among us like a cannon-ball,” answered the notary.

“That doesn’t prove anything,” said Monsieur des Grassins; “the old miser is always making mysteries.”

“Des Grassins, my friend, I have invited the young man to dinner. You must go and ask Monsieur and Madame de Larsonniere and the du Hautoys, with the beautiful demoiselle du Hautoy, of course. I hope she will be properly dressed; that jealous mother of hers does make such a fright of her! Gentlemen, I trust that you will all do us the honor to come,” she added, stopping the procession to address the two Cruchots.

“Here you are at home, madame,” said the notary.

After bowing to the three des Grassins, the three Cruchots returned home, applying their provincial genius for analysis to studying, under all its aspects, the great event of the evening, which undoubtedly changed the respective positions of Grassinists and Cruchotines. The admirable common-sense which guided all the actions of these great machinators made each side feel the necessity of a momentary alliance against a common enemy. Must they not mutually hinder Eugenie from loving her cousin, and the cousin from thinking of Eugenie? Could the Parisian resist the influence of treacherous insinuations, soft-spoken calumnies, slanders full of faint praise and artless denials, which should be made to circle incessantly about him and deceive him?

When the four relations were left alone, Monsieur Grandet said to his nephew—

“We must go to bed. It is too late to talk about the matters which have brought you here; to-morrow we will take a suitable moment. We breakfast at eight o’clock; at midday we eat a little fruit or a bit of bread, and drink a glass of white wine; and we dine, like the Parisians, at five o’clock. That’s the order of the day. If you like to go and see the town and the environs you are free to do so. You will excuse me if my occupations do not permit me to accompany you. You may perhaps hear people say that I am rich—Monsieur Grandet this, Monsieur Grandet that. I let them talk; their gossip does not hurt my credit. But I have not a penny; I work in my old age like an apprentice whose worldly goods are a bad plane and two good arms. Perhaps you’ll soon know yourself what a franc costs when you have got to sweat for it. Nanon, where are the candles?”

“I trust, my nephew, that you will find all you want,” said Madame Grandet; “but if you should need anything else, you can call Nanon.”

“My dear aunt, I shall need nothing; I have, I believe, brought everything with me. Permit me to bid you good-night, and my young cousin also.”

Charles took a lighted wax candle from Nanon’s hand—an Anjou candle, very yellow in color, and so shopworn that it looked like tallow and deceived Monsieur Grandet, who, incapable of suspecting its presence under his roof, did not perceive this magnificence.

“I will show you the way,” he said.

Instead of leaving the hall by the door which opened under the archway, Grandet ceremoniously went through the passage which divided the hall from the kitchen. A swing-door, furnished with a large oval pane of glass, shut this passage from the staircase, so as to fend off the cold air which rushed through it. But the north wind whistled none the less keenly in winter, and, in spite of the sand-bags at the bottom of the doors of the living-room, the temperature within could scarcely be kept at a proper height.

Nanon went to bolt the outer door; then she closed the hall and let loose a wolf-dog, whose bark was so strangled that he seemed to have laryngitis. This animal, noted for his ferocity, recognized no one but Nanon; the two untutored children of the fields understood each other.When Charles saw the yellow, smoke-stained walls of the well of the staircase, where each worm-eaten step shook under the heavy foot-fall of his uncle, his expectations began to sober more and more. He fancied himself in a hen-roost. His aunt and cousin, to whom he turned an inquiring look, were so used to the staircase that they did not guess the cause of his amazement, and took the glance for an expression of friendliness, which they answered by a smile that made him desperate.

“Why the devil did my father send me to such a place?” he said to himself.

When they reached the first landing he saw three doors painted in Etruscan red and without casings—doors sunk in the dusty walls and provided with iron bars, which in fact were bolts, each ending with the pattern of a flame, as did both ends of the long sheath of the lock. The first door at the top of the staircase, which opened into a room directly above the kitchen, was evidently walled up. In fact, the only entrance to that room was through Grandet’s bedchamber; the room itself was his office. The single window which lighted it, on the side of the court, was protected by a lattice of strong iron bars.

No one, not even Madame Grandet, had permission to enter it. The old man chose to be alone, like an alchemist in his laboratory. There, no doubt, some hiding-place had been ingeniously constructed; there the title-deeds of property were stored; there hung the scales on which to weigh the louis; there were devised, by night and secretly, the estimates, the profits, the receipts, so that business men, finding Grandet prepared at all points, imagined that he got his cue from fairies or demons; there, no doubt, while Nanon’s loud snoring shook the rafters, while the wolf-dog watched and yawned in the courtyard, while Madame and Mademoiselle Grandet were quietly sleeping, came the old cooper to cuddle, to con over, to caress and clutch and clasp his gold. The walls were thick, the screens sure. He alone had the key of this laboratory, where—so people declared—he studied the maps on which his fruit-trees were marked, and calculated his profits to a vine, and almost to a twig.

The door of Eugenie’s chamber was opposite to the walled-up entrance to this room. At the other end of the landing were the appartements of the married pair, which occupied the whole front of the house. Madame Grandet had a room next to that of Eugenie, which was entered through a glass door. The master’s chamber was separated from that of his wife by a partition, and from the mysterious strong-room by a thick wall.

Pere Grandet lodged his nephew on the second floor, in the high mansarde attic which was above his own bedroom, so that he might hear him if the young man took it into his head to go and come.

When Eugenie and her mother reached the middle of the landing they kissed each other for good-night; then with a few words of adieu to Charles, cold upon the lips, but certainly very warm in the heart of the young girl, they withdrew into their own chambers.

“Here you are in your room, my nephew,” said Pere Grandet as he opened the door. “If you need to go out, call Nanon; without her, beware! the dog would eat you up without a word. Sleep well. Good-night. Ha! why, they have made you a fire!” he cried.

At this moment Nanon appeared with the warming pan.

“Here’s something more!” said Monsieur Grandet. “Do you take my nephew for a lying-in woman? Carry off your brazier, Nanon!”

“But, monsieur, the sheets are damp, and this gentleman is as delicate as a woman.”

“Well, go on, as you’ve taken it into your head,” said Grandet, pushing her by the shoulders; “but don’t set things on fire.”

So saying, the miser went down-stairs, grumbling indistinct sentences.

Charles stood aghast in the midst of his trunks. After casting his eyes on the attic-walls covered with that yellow paper sprinkled with bouquets so well known in dance-houses, on the fireplace of ribbed stone whose very look was chilling, on the chairs of yellow wood with varnished cane seats that seemed to have more than the usual four angles, on the open night-table capacious enough to hold a small sergeant-at-arms, on the meagre bit of rag-carpet beside the bed, on the tester whose cloth valance shook as if, devoured by moths, it was about to fall, he turned gravely to la Grande Nanon and said—

“Look here! my dear woman, just tell me, am I in the house of Monsieur Grandet, formerly mayor of Saumur, and brother to Monsieur Grandet of Paris?”

“Yes, monsieur; and a very good, a very kind, a very perfect gentleman. Shall I help you to unpack your trunks?”

“Faith! yes, if you will, my old trooper. Didn’t you serve in the marines of the Imperial Guard?”

“Ho, ho, ho!” laughed Nanon. “What’s that? The marines of the guard? Is it salt? Does it go in the water?”

“Here, get me my dressing-gown out of that valise; there’s the key.”

Nanon was wonder-struck by the sight of a dressing-gown made of green silk, brocaded with gold flowers of an antique design.

“Are you going to put that on to go to bed with?” she asked.

“Yes.”

“Holy Virgin! what a beautiful altar-cloth it would make for the parish church! My dear darling monsieur, give it to the church, and you’ll save your soul; if you don’t, you’ll lose it. Oh, how nice you look in it! I must call mademoiselle to see you.”

“Come, Nanon, if Nanon you are, hold your tongue; let me go to bed. I’ll arrange my things to-morrow. If my dressing-gown pleases you so much, you shall save your soul. I’m too good a Christian not to give it to you when I go away, and you can do what you like with it.”

Nanon stood rooted to the ground, gazing at Charles and unable to put faith into his words.

“Good night, Nanon.”

“What in the world have I come here for?” thought Charles as he went to sleep. “My father is not a fool; my journey must have some object. Pshaw! put off serious thought till the morrow, as some Greek idiot said.”

“Blessed Virgin! how charming he is, my cousin!” Eugenie was saying, interrupting her prayers, which that night at least were never finished.

Madame Grandet had no thoughts at all as she went to bed. She heard the miser walking up and down his room through the door of communication which was in the middle of the partition. Like all timid women, she had studied the character of her lord. Just as the petrel foresees the storm, she knew by imperceptible signs when an inward tempest shook her husband; and at such times, to use an expression of her own, she “feigned dead.”

Grandet gazed at the door lined with sheet-iron which he lately put to his sanctum, and said to himself—

“What a crazy idea of my brother to bequeath his son to me! A fine legacy! I have not fifty francs to give him. What are fifty francs to a dandy who looked at my barometer as if he meant to make firewood of it!”

In thinking over the consequences of that legacy of anguish Grandet was perhaps more agitated than his brother had been at the moment of writing it.

“I shall have that golden robe,” thought Nanon, who went to sleep tricked out in her altar-cloth, dreaming for the first time in her life of flowers, embroidery, and damask, just as Eugenie was dreaming of love.





III


In the pure and monotonous life of young girls there comes a delicious hour when the sun sheds its rays into their soul, when the flowers express their thoughts, when the throbbings of the heart send upward to the brain their fertilizing warmth and melt all thoughts into a vague desire—day of innocent melancholy and of dulcet joys! When babes begin to see, they smile; when a young girl first perceives the sentiment of nature, she smiles as she smiled when an infant. If light is the first love of life, is not love a light to the heart? The moment to see within the veil of earthly things had come for Eugenie.

An early riser, like all provincial girls, she was up betimes and said her prayers, and then began the business of dressing—a business which henceforth was to have a meaning. First she brushed and smoothed her chestnut hair and twisted its heavy masses to the top of her head with the utmost care, preventing the loose tresses from straying, and giving to her head a symmetry which heightened the timid candor of her face; for the simplicity of these accessories accorded well with the innocent sincerity of its lines. As she washed her hands again and again in the cold water which hardened and reddened the skin, she looked at her handsome round arms and asked herself what her cousin did to make his hands so softly white, his nails so delicately curved. She put on new stockings and her prettiest shoes. She laced her corset straight, without skipping a single eyelet. And then, wishing for the first time in her life to appear to advantage, she felt the joy of having a new gown, well made, which rendered her attractive.

As she finished her toilet the clock of the parish church struck the hour; to her astonishment, it was only seven. The desire of having plenty of time for dressing carefully had led her to get up too early. Ignorant of the art of retouching every curl and studying every effect, Eugenie simply crossed her arms, sat down by the window, and looked at the court-yard, the narrow garden, and the high terraced walls that over-topped it: a dismal, hedged-in prospect, yet not wholly devoid of those mysterious beauties which belong to solitary or uncultivated nature.

Near the kitchen was a well surrounded by a curb, with a pulley fastened to a bent iron rod clasped by a vine whose leaves were withered, reddened, and shrivelled by the season. From thence the tortuous shoots straggled to the wall, clutched it, and ran the whole length of the house, ending near the wood-pile, where the logs were ranged with as much precision as the books in a library. The pavement of the court-yard showed the black stains produced in time by lichens, herbage, and the absence of all movement or friction. The thick walls wore a coating of green moss streaked with waving brown lines, and the eight stone steps at the bottom of the court-yard which led up to the gate of the garden were disjointed and hidden beneath tall plants, like the tomb of a knight buried by his widow in the days of the Crusades. Above a foundation of moss-grown, crumbling stones was a trellis of rotten wood, half fallen from decay;over them clambered and intertwined at will a mass of clustering creepers. On each side of the latticed gate stretched the crooked arms of two stunted apple-trees. Three parallel walks, gravelled and separated from each other by square beds, where the earth was held in by box-borders, made the garden, which terminated, beneath a terrace of the old walls, in a group of lindens. At the farther end were raspberry-bushes; at the other, near the house, an immense walnut-tree drooped its branches almost into the window of the miser’s sanctum. A clear day and the beautiful autumnal sun common to the banks of the Loire was beginning to melt the hoar-frost which the night had laid on these picturesque objects, on the walls, and on the plants which swathed the court-yard.

Eugenie found a novel charm in the aspect of things lately so insignificant to her. A thousand confused thoughts came to birth in her mind and grew there, as the sunbeams grew without along the wall. She felt that impulse of delight, vague, inexplicable, which wraps the moral being as a cloud wraps the physical body. Her thoughts were all in keeping with the details of this strange landscape, and the harmonies of her heart blended with the harmonies of nature.

When the sun reached an angle of the wall where the “Venus-hair” of southern climes drooped its thick leaves, lit with the changing colors of a pigeon’s breast, celestial rays of hope illumined the future to her eyes, and thenceforth she loved to gaze upon that piece of wall, on its pale flowers, its blue harebells, its wilting herbage, with which she mingled memories as tender as those of childhood. The noise made by each leaf as it fell from its twig in the void of that echoing court gave answer to the secret questionings of the young girl, who could have stayed there the livelong day without perceiving the flight of time.

Then came tumultuous heavings of the soul. She rose often, went to her glass, and looked at herself, as an author in good faith looks at his work to criticise it and blame it in his own mind.

“I am not beautiful enough for him!”

Such was Eugenie’s thought—a humble thought, fertile in suffering. The poor girl did not do herself justice; but modesty, or rather fear, is among the first of love’s virtues. Eugenie belonged to the type of children with sturdy constitutions, such as we see among the lesser bourgeoisie, whose beauties always seem a little vulgar;and yet, though she resembled the Venus of Milo, the lines of her figure were ennobled by the softer Christian sentiment which purifies womanhood and gives it a distinction unknown to the sculptors of antiquity. She had an enormous head, with the masculine yet delicate forehead of the Jupiter of Phidias, and gray eyes, to which her chaste life, penetrating fully into them, carried a flood of light. The features of her round face, formerly fresh and rosy, were at one time swollen by the small-pox, which destroyed the velvet texture of the skin, though it kindly left no other traces, and her cheek was still so soft and delicate that her mother’s kiss made a momentary red mark upon it. Her nose was somewhat too thick, but it harmonized well with the vermilion mouth, whose lips, creased in many lines, were full of love and kindness. The throat was exquisitely round. The bust, well curved and carefully covered, attracted the eye and inspired reverie. It lacked, no doubt, the grace which a fitting dress can bestow; but to a connoisseur the non-flexibility of her figure had its own charm. Eugenie, tall and strongly made, had none of the prettiness which pleases the masses; but she was beautiful with a beauty which the spirit recognizes, and none but artists truly love. A painter seeking here below for a type of Mary’s celestial purity, searching womankind for those proud modest eyes which Raphael divined, for those virgin lines, often due to chances of conception, which the modesty of Christian life alone can bestow or keep unchanged—such a painter, in love with his ideal, would have found in the face of Eugenie the innate nobleness that is ignorant of itself; he would have seen beneath the calmness of that brow a world of love; he would have felt, in the shape of the eyes, in the fall of the eyelids, the presence of the nameless something that we call divine. Her features, the contour of her head, which no expression of pleasure had ever altered or wearied, were like the lines of the horizon softly traced in the far distance across the tranquil lakes. That calm and rosy countenance, margined with light like a lovely full-blown flower, rested the mind, held the eye, and imparted the charm of the conscience that was there reflected.

Eugenie was standing on the shore of life where young illusions flower, where daisies are gathered with delights ere long to be unknown; and thus she said, looking at her image in the glass, unconscious as yet of love: “I am too ugly; he will not notice me.”

Then she opened the door of her chamber which led to the staircase, and stretched out her neck to listen for the household noises. “He is not up,” she thought, hearing Nanon’s morning cough as the good soul went and came, sweeping out the halls, lighting her fire, chaining the dog, and speaking to the beasts in the stable.

Eugenie at once went down and ran to Nanon, who was milking the cow.

“Nanon, my good Nanon, make a little cream for my cousin’s breakfast.”

“Why, mademoiselle, you should have thought of that yesterday,” said Nanon, bursting into a loud peal of laughter. “I can’t make cream. Your cousin is a darling, a darling! oh, that he is! You should have seen him in his dressing-gown, all silk and gold! I saw him, I did! He wears linen as fine as the surplice of monsieur le cure.”

“Nanon, please make us a galette.”

“And who’ll give me wood for the oven, and flour and butter for the cakes?” said Nanon, who in her function of prime-minister to Grandet assumed at times enormous importance in the eyes of Eugenie and her mother. “Mustn’t rob the master to feast the cousin. You ask him for butter and flour and wood: he’s your father, perhaps he’ll give you some. See! there he is now, coming to give out the provisions.”

Eugenie escaped into the garden, quite frightened as she heard the staircase shaking under her father’s step. Already she felt the effects of that virgin modesty and that special consciousness of happiness which lead us to fancy, not perhaps without reason, that our thoughts are graven on our foreheads and are open to the eyes of all. Perceiving for the first time the cold nakedness of her father’s house, the poor girl felt a sort of rage that she could not put it in harmony with her cousin’s elegance. She felt the need of doing something for him—what, she did not know. Ingenuous and truthful, she followed her angelic nature without mistrusting her impressions or her feelings. The mere sight of her cousin had wakened within her the natural yearnings of a woman—yearnings that were the more likely to develop ardently because, having reached her twenty-third year, she was in the plenitude of her intelligence and her desires. For the first time in her life her heart was full of terror at the sight of her father; in him she saw the master of the fate, and she fancied herself guilty of wrong-doing in hiding from his knowledge certain thoughts. She walked with hasty steps, surprised to breathe a purer air, to feel the sun’s rays quickening her pulses, to absorb from their heat a moral warmth and a new life.

As she turned over in her mind some stratagem by which to get the cake, a quarrel—an event as rare as the sight of swallows in winter—broke out between la Grande Nanon and Grandet. Armed with his keys, the master had come to dole out provisions for the day’s consumption.

“Is there any bread left from yesterday?” he said to Nanon.

“Not a crumb, monsieur.”

Grandet took a large round loaf, well floured and moulded in one of the flat baskets which they use for baking in Anjou, and was about to cut it, when Nanon said to him—

“We are five, to-day, monsieur.”

“That’s true,” said Grandet, “but your loaves weigh six pounds;there’ll be some left. Besides, these young fellows from Paris don’t eat bread, you’ll see.”

“Then they must eat frippe?” said Nanon.

Frippe is a word of the local lexicon of Anjou, and means any accompaniment of bread, from butter which is spread upon it, the commonest kind of frippe, to peach preserve, the most distinguished of all the frippes; those who in their childhood have licked the frippe and left the bread, will comprehend the meaning of Nanon’s speech.

“No,” answered Grandet, “they eat neither bread nor frippe;they are something like marriageable girls.”

After ordering the meals for the day with his usual parsimony, the goodman, having locked the closets containing the supplies, was about to go towards the fruit-garden, when Nanon stopped him to say—

“Monsieur, give me a little flour and some butter, and I’ll make a galette for the young ones.”

“Are you going to pillage the house on account of my nephew?”

“I wasn’t thinking any more of your nephew than I was of your dog—not more than you think yourself; for, look here, you’ve only forked out six bits of sugar. I want eight.”

“What’s all this, Nanon? I have never seen you like this before. What have you got in your head? Are you the mistress here? You sha’n’t have more than six pieces of sugar.”

“Well, then, how is your nephew to sweeten his coffee?”

“With two pieces; I’ll go without myself.”

“Go without sugar at your age! I’d rather buy you some out of my own pocket.”

“Mind your own business.”

In spite of the recent fall in prices, sugar was still in Grandet’s eyes the most valuable of all the colonial products; to him it was always six francs a pound. The necessity of economizing it, acquired under the Empire, had grown to be the most inveterate of his habits.

All women, even the greatest ninnies, know how to dodge and dodge to get their ends; Nanon abandoned the sugar for the sake of getting the galette.

“Mademoiselle!” she called through the window, “Do you want some galette?”

“No, no,” answered Eugenie.

“Come, Nanon,” said Grandet, hearing his daughter’s voice.“See here.”

He opened the cupboard where the flour was kept, gave her a cupful, and added a few ounces of butter to the piece he had already cut off.

“I shall want wood for the oven,” said the implacable Nanon.

“Well, take what you want,” he answered sadly; “but in that case you must make us a fruit-tart, and you’ll cook the whole dinner in the oven. In that way you won’t need two fires.”

“Goodness!” cried Nanon, “You needn’t tell me that.”

Grandet cast a look that was well-nigh paternal upon his faithful deputy.

“Mademoiselle,” she cried, when his back was turned, “we shall have the galette.”

Pere Grandet returned from the garden with the fruit and arranged a plateful on the kitchen-table.

“Just see, monsieur,” said Nanon, “what pretty boots your nephew has. What leather! Why it smells good! What does he clean it with, I wonder? Am I to put your egg-polish on it?”

“Nanon, I think eggs would injure that kind of leather. Tell him you don’t know how to black morocco; yes, that’s morocco. He will get you something himself in Saumur to polish those boots with. I have heard that they put sugar into the blacking to make it shine.”

“They look good to eat,” said the cook, putting the boots to her nose. “Bless me! if they don’t smell like madame’s eau-de-cologne. Ah! how funny!”

“Funny!” said her master. “Do you call it funny to put more money into boots than the man who stands in them is worth?”

“Monsieur,” she said, when Grandet returned the second time, after locking the fruit-garden, “won’t you have the pot-au-feu put on once or twice a week on account of your nephew?”

“Yes.”

“Am I to go to the butcher’s?”

“Certainly not. We will make the broth of fowls; the farmers will bring them. I shall tell Cornoiller to shoot some crows; they make the best soup in the world.”

“Isn’t it true, monsieur, that crows eat the dead?”

“You are a fool, Nanon. They eat what they can get, like the rest of the world. Don’t we all live on the dead? What are legacies?”

Monsieur Grandet, having no further orders to give, drew out his watch, and seeing that he had half an hour to dispose of before breakfast, he took his hat, went and kissed his daughter, and said to her:

“Do you want to come for a walk in the fields, down by the Loire? I have something to do there.”

Eugenie fetched her straw bonnet, lined with pink taffeta; then the father and daughter went down the winding street to the shore.

“Where are you going at this early hour?” said Cruchot, the notary, meeting them.

“To see something,” answered Grandet, not duped by the matutinal appearance of his friend.

When Pere Grandet went to “see something,” the notary knew by experience there was something to be got by going with him; so he went.

“Come, Cruchot,” said Grandet, “you are one of my friends. I’ll show you what folly it is to plant poplar-trees on good ground.”

“Do you call the sixty thousand francs that you pocketed for those that were in your fields down by the Loire, folly?” said Maitre Cruchot, opening his eyes with amazement. “What luck you have had! To cut down your trees at the very time they ran short of white-wood at Nantes, and to sell them at thirty francs!”

Eugenie listened, without knowing that she approached the most solemn moment of her whole life, and that the notary was about to bring down upon her head a paternal and supreme sentence.

Grandet had now reached the magnificent fields which he owned on the banks of the Loire, where thirty workmen were employed in clearing away, filling up, and levelling the spots formerly occupied by the poplars.

“Maitre Cruchot, see how much ground this tree once took up! Jean,” he cried to a laborer, “m-m-measure with your r-r-rule, b-both ways.”

“Four times eight feet,” said the man.

“Thirty-two feet lost,” said Grandet to Cruchot. “I had three hundred poplars in this one line, isn’t that so? Well, then, three h-h-hundred times thir-thirty-two lost m-m-me five hundred in h-h-hay;add twice as much for the side rows—fifteen hundred; the middle rows as much more. So we may c-c-call it a th-thousand b-b-bales of h-h-hay—”

“Very good,” said Cruchot, to help out his friend; “a thousand bales are worth about six hundred francs.”

“Say t-t-twelve hundred, be-c-cause there’s three or four hundred francs on the second crop. Well, then, c-c-calculate that t-twelve thousand francs a year for f-f-forty years with interest c-c-comes to—”

“Say sixty thousand francs,” said the notary.

“I am willing; c-c-comes t-t-to sixty th-th-thousand. Very good,” continued Grandet, without stuttering: “two thousand poplars forty years old will only yield me fifty thousand francs. There’s a loss. I have found that myself,” said Grandet, getting on his high horse. “Jean, fill up all the holes except those at the bank of the river;there you are to plant the poplars I have bought. Plant ‘em there, and they’ll get nourishment from the government,” he said, turning to Cruchot, and giving a slight motion to the wen on his nose, which expressed more than the most ironical of smiles.

“True enough; poplars should only be planted on poor soil,”said Cruchot, amazed at Grandet’s calculations.

“Y-y-yes, monsieur,” answered the old man satirically.

Eugenie, who was gazing at the sublime scenery of the Loire, and paying no attention to her father’s reckonings, presently turned an ear to the remarks of Cruchot when she heard him say—

“So you have brought a son-in-law from Paris. All Saumur is talking about your nephew. I shall soon have the marriage-contract to draw up, hey! Pere Grandet?”

“You g-g-got up very early to t-t-tell me that,” said Grandet, accompanying the remark with a motion of his wen. “Well, old c-c-comrade, I’ll be frank, and t-t-tell you what you want t-t-to know. I would rather, do you see, f-f-fling my daughter into the Loire than g-g-give her to her c-c-cousin. You may t-t-tell that everywhere—no, never mind; let the world t-t-talk.”

This answer dazzled and blinded the young girl with sudden light. The distant hopes upspringing in her heart bloomed suddenly, became real, tangible, like a cluster of flowers, and she saw them cut down and wilting on the earth. Since the previous evening she had attached herself to Charles by those links of happiness which bind soul to soul; from henceforth suffering was to rivet them. Is it not the noble destiny of women to be more moved by the dark solemnities of grief than by the splendors of fortune? How was it that fatherly feeling had died out of her father’s heart? Of what crime had Charles been guilty? Mysterious questions! Already her dawning love, a mystery so profound, was wrapping itself in mystery. She walked back trembling in all her limbs; and when she reached the gloomy street, lately so joyous to her, she felt its sadness, she breathed the melancholy which time and events had printed there. None of love’s lessons lacked.

A few steps from their own door she went on before her father and waited at the threshold. But Grandet, who saw a newspaper in the notary’s hand, stopped short and asked—

“How are the Funds?”

“You never listen to my advice, Grandet,” answered Cruchot.“Buy soon; you will still make twenty per cent in two years, besides getting an excellent rate of interest—five thousand a year for eighty thousand francs fifty centimes.”

“We’ll see about that,” answered Grandet, rubbing his chin.

“Good God!” exclaimed the notary.

“Well, what?” cried Grandet; and at the same moment Cruchot put the newspaper under his eyes and said: “Read that!”

“Monsieur Grandet, one of the most respected merchants in Paris, blew his brains out yesterday, after making his usual appearance at the Bourse. He had sent his resignation to the president of the Chamber of Deputies, and had also resigned his functions as a judge of the commercial courts. The failures of Monsieur Roguin and Monsieur Souchet, his broker and his notary, had ruined him.The esteem felt for Monsieur Grandet and the credit he enjoyed were nevertheless such that he might have obtained the necessary assistance from other business houses. It is much to be regretted that so honorable a man should have yielded to momentary despair,” etc.

“I knew it,” said the old wine-grower to the notary.

The words sent a chill of horror through Maitre Cruchot, who, notwithstanding his impassibility as a notary, felt the cold running down his spine as he thought that Grandet of Paris had possibly implored in vain the millions of Grandet of Saumur.

“And his son, so joyous yesterday—”

“He knows nothing as yet,” answered Grandet, with the same composure.

“Adieu! Monsieur Grandet,” said Cruchot, who now understood the state of the case, and went off to reassure Monsieur de Bonfons.

On entering, Grandet found breakfast ready. Madame Grandet, round whose neck Eugenie had flung her arms, kissing her with the quick effusion of feeling often caused by secret grief, was already seated in her chair on castors, knitting sleeves for the coming winter.

“You can begin to eat,” said Nanon, coming downstairs four steps at a time; “the young one is sleeping like a cherub. Isn’t he a darling with his eyes shut? I went in and I called him: no answer.”

“Let him sleep,” said Grandet; “he’ll wake soon enough to hear ill-tidings.”

“What is it?” asked Eugenie, putting into her coffee the two little bits of sugar weighing less than half an ounce which the old miser amused himself by cutting up in his leisure hours. Madame Grandet, who did not dare to put the question, gazed at her husband.

“His father has blown his brains out.”

“My uncle?” said Eugenie.

“Poor young man!” exclaimed Madame Grandet.

“Poor indeed!” said Grandet; “he isn’t worth a sou!”

“Eh! poor boy, and he’s sleeping like the king of the world!”said Nanon in a gentle voice.

Eugenie stopped eating. Her heart was wrung, as the young heart is wrung when pity for the suffering of one she loves overflows, for the first time, the whole being of a woman. The poor girl wept.

“What are you crying about? You didn’t know your uncle,” said her father, giving her one of those hungry tigerish looks he doubtless threw upon his piles of gold.

“But, monsieur,” said Nanon, “who wouldn’t feel pity for the poor young man, sleeping there like a wooden shoe, without knowing what’s coming?”

“I didn’t speak to you, Nanon. Hold your tongue!”

Eugenie learned at that moment that the woman who loves must be able to hide her feelings. She did not answer.

“You will say nothing to him about it, Ma’ame Grandet, till I return,” said the old man. “I have to go and straighten the line of my hedge along the high-road. I shall be back at noon, in time for the second breakfast, and then I will talk with my nephew about his affairs. As for you, Mademoiselle Eugenie, if it is for that dandy you are crying, that’s enough, child. He’s going off like a shot to the Indies. You will never see him again.”

The father took his gloves from the brim of his hat, put them on with his usual composure, pushed them in place by shoving the fingers of both hands together, and went out.

“Mamma, I am suffocating!” cried Eugenie when she was alone with her mother; “I have never suffered like this.”

Madame Grandet, seeing that she turned pale, opened the window and let her breathe fresh air.

“I feel better!” said Eugenie after a moment.

This nervous excitement in a nature hitherto, to all appearance, calm and cold, reacted on Madame Grandet; she looked at her daughter with the sympathetic intuition with which mothers are gifted for the objects of their tenderness, and guessed all. In truth the life of the Hungarian sisters, bound together by a freak of nature, could scarcely have been more intimate than that of Eugenie and her mother—always together in the embrasure of that window, and sleeping together in the same atmosphere.

“My poor child!” said Madame Grandet, taking Eugenie’s head and laying it upon her bosom.

At these words the young girl raised her head, questioned her mother by a look, and seemed to search out her inmost thought.

“Why send him to the Indies?” she said. “If he is unhappy, ought he not to stay with us? Is he not our nearest relation?”

“Yes, my child, it seems natural; but your father has his reasons:we must respect them.”

The mother and daughter sat down in silence, the former upon her raised seat, the latter in her little armchair, and both took up their work. Swelling with gratitude for the full heart-understanding her mother had given her, Eugenie kissed the dear hand, saying—

“How good you are, my kind mamma!”

The words sent a glow of light into the motherly face, worn and blighted as it was by many sorrows.

“You like him?” asked Eugenie.

Madame Grandet only smiled in reply. Then, after a moment’s silence, she said in a low voice: “Do you love him already? That is wrong.”

“Wrong?” said Eugenie. “Why is it wrong? You are pleased with him, Nanon is pleased with him; why should he not please me? Come, mamma, let us set the table for his breakfast.”

She threw down her work, and her mother did the same, saying,“Foolish child!”

But she sanctioned the child’s folly by sharing it.

Eugenie called Nanon.

“What do you want now, mademoiselle?”

“Nanon, can we have cream by midday?”

“Ah! midday, to be sure you can,” answered the old servant.

“Well, let him have his coffee very strong; I heard Monsieur des Grassins say that they make the coffee very strong in Paris. Put in a great deal.”

“Where am I to get it?”

“Buy some.”

“Suppose monsieur meets me?”

“He has gone to his fields.”

“I’ll run, then. But Monsieur Fessard asked me yesterday if the Magi had come to stay with us when I bought the wax candle. All the town will know our goings-on.”

“If your father finds it out,” said Madame Grandet, “he is capable of beating us.”

“Well, let him beat us; we will take his blows on our knees.”

Madame Grandet for all answer raised her eyes to heaven. Nanon put on her hood and went off. Eugenie got out some clean table-linen, and went to fetch a few bunches of grapes which she had amused herself by hanging on a string across the attic; she walked softly along the corridor, so as not to waken her cousin, and she could not help listening at the door to his quiet breathing.

“Sorrow is watching while he sleeps,” she thought.

She took the freshest vine-leaves and arranged her dish of grapes as coquettishly as a practised house-keeper might have done, and placed it triumphantly on the table. She laid hands on the pears counted out by her father, and piled them in a pyramid mixed with leaves. She went and came, and skipped and ran. She would have liked to lay under contribution everything in her father’s house; but the keys were in his pocket. Nanon came back with two fresh eggs. At sight of them Eugenie almost hugged her round the neck.

“The farmer from Lande had them in his basket. I asked him for them, and he gave them to me, the darling, for nothing, as an attention!”

After two hours’ thought and care, during which Eugenie jumped up twenty times from her work to see if the coffee were boiling, or to go and listen to the noise her cousin made in dressing, she succeeded in preparing a simple little breakfast, very inexpensive, but which, nevertheless, departed alarmingly from the inveterate customs of the house. The midday breakfast was always taken standing. Each took a slice of bread, a little fruit or some butter, and a glass of wine. As Eugenie looked at the table drawn up near the fire with an arm-chair placed before her cousin’s plate, at the two dishes of fruit, the egg-cup, the bottle of white wine, the bread, and the sugar heaped up in a saucer, she trembled in all her limbs at the mere thought of the look her father would give her if he should come in at that moment. She glanced often at the clock to see if her cousin could breakfast before the master’s return.

“Don’t be troubled, Eugenie; if your father comes in, I will take it all upon myself,” said Madame Grandet. Eugenie could not repress a tear.

“Oh, my good mother!” she cried, “I have never loved you enough.”

Charles, who had been tramping about his room for some time, singing to himself, now came down. Happily, it was only eleven o’clock. The true Parisian! he had put as much dandyism into his dress as if he were in the chateau of the noble lady then travelling in Scotland. He came into the room with the smiling, courteous manner so becoming to youth, which made Eugenie’s heart beat with mournful joy. He had taken the destruction of his castles in Anjou as a joke, and came up to his aunt gaily.

“Have you slept well, dear aunt? and you, too, my cousin?”

“Very well, monsieur; did you?” said Madame Grandet.

“I? Perfectly.”

“You must be hungry, cousin,” said Eugenie; “will you take your seat?”

“I never breakfast before midday; I never get up till then. However, I fared so badly on the journey that I am glad to eat something at once. Besides—” here he pulled out the prettiest watch Breguet ever made.

“Dear me! I am early, it is only eleven o’clock!”

“Early?” said Madame Grandet.

“Yes; but I wanted to put my things in order. Well, I shall be glad to have anything to eat—anything, it doesn’t matter what, a chicken, a partridge.”

“Holy Virgin!” exclaimed Nanon, overhearing the words.

“A partridge!” whispered Eugenie to herself; she would gladly have given the whole of her little hoard for a partridge.

“Come and sit down,” said his aunt.

The young dandy let himself drop into an easy-chair, just as a pretty woman falls gracefully upon a sofa. Eugenie and her mother took ordinary chairs and sat beside him, near the fire.

“Do you always live here?” said Charles, thinking the room uglier by daylight than it had seemed the night before.

“Always,” answered Eugenie, looking at him, “except during the vintage. Then we go and help Nanon, and live at the Abbaye des Noyers.”

“Don’t you ever take walks?”

“Sometimes on Sunday after vespers, when the weather is fine,”said Madame Grandet, “we walk on the bridge, or we go and watch the haymakers.”

“Have you a theatre?”

“Go to the theatre!” exclaimed Madame Grandet, “See a play!Why, monsieur, don’t you know it is a mortal sin?”

“See here, monsieur,” said Nanon, bringing in the eggs, “here are your chickens—in the shell.”

“Oh! fresh eggs,” said Charles, who, like all people accustomed to luxury, had already forgotten about his partridge, “that is delicious: now, if you will give me the butter, my good girl.”

“Butter! then you can’t have the galette.”

“Nanon, bring the butter,” cried Eugenie.

The young girl watched her cousin as he cut his sippets, with as much pleasure as a grisette takes in a melodrama where innocence and virtue triumph. Charles, brought up by a charming mother, improved, and trained by a woman of fashion, had the elegant, dainty, foppish movements of a coxcomb. The compassionate sympathy and tenderness of a young girl possess a power that is actually magnetic; so that Charles, finding himself the object of the attentions of his aunt and cousin, could not escape the influence of feelings which flowed towards him, as it were, and inundated him. He gave Eugenie a bright, caressing look full of kindness—a look which seemed itself a smile. He perceived, as his eyes lingered upon her, the exquisite harmony of features in the pure face, the grace of her innocent attitude, the magic clearness of the eyes, where young love sparkled and desire shone unconsciously.

“Ah! my dear cousin, if you were in full dress at the Opera, I assure you my aunt’s words would come true—you would make the men commit the mortal sin of envy, and the women the sin of jealousy.”

The compliment went to Eugenie’s heart and set it beating, though she did not understand its meaning.

“Oh! cousin,” she said, “you are laughing at a poor little country girl.”

“If you knew me, my cousin, you would know that I abhor ridicule; it withers the heart and jars upon all my feelings.”

Here he swallowed his buttered sippet very gracefully.

“No, I really have not enough mind to make fun of others; and doubtless it is a great defect. In Paris, when they want to disparage a man, they say: ‘He has a good heart.’ The phrase means: ‘The poor fellow is as stupid as a rhinoceros.’ But as I am rich, and known to hit the bull’s-eye at thirty paces with any kind of pistol, and even in the open fields, ridicule respects me.”

“My dear nephew, that bespeaks a good heart.”

“You have a very pretty ring,” said Eugenie; “is there any harm in asking to see it?”

Charles held out his hand after loosening the ring, and Eugenie blushed as she touched the pink nails of her cousin with the tips of her fingers.

“See, mamma, what beautiful workmanship.”

“My! there’s a lot of gold!” said Nanon, bringing in the coffee.

“What is that?” exclaimed Charles, laughing, as he pointed to an oblong pot of brown earthenware, glazed on the inside, and edged with a fringe of ashes, from the bottom of which the coffee-grounds were bubbling up and falling in the boiling liquid.

“It is boiled coffee,” said Nanon.

“Ah! my dear aunt, I shall at least leave one beneficent trace of my visit here. You are indeed behind the age! I must teach you to make good coffee in a Chaptal coffee-pot.”

He tried to explain the process of a Chaptal coffee-pot.

“Gracious! if there are so many things as all that to do,” said Nanon, “we may as well give up our lives to it. I shall never make coffee that way; I know that! Pray, who is to get the fodder for the cow while I make the coffee?”

“I will make it,” said Eugenie.

“Child!” said Madame Grandet, looking at her daughter.

The word recalled to their minds the sorrow that was about to fall upon the unfortunate young man; the three women were silent, and looked at him with an air of commiseration that caught his attention.

“Is anything the matter, my cousin?” he said.

“Hush!” said Madame Grandet to Eugenie, who was about to answer; “you know, my daughter, that your father charged us not to speak to monsieur—”

“Say Charles,” said young Grandet.

“Ah! you are called Charles? What a beautiful name!” cried Eugenie.

Presentiments of evil are almost always justified. At this moment Nanon, Madame Grandet, and Eugenie, who had all three been thinking with a shudder of the old man’s return, heard the knock whose echoes they knew but too well.

“There’s papa!” said Eugenie.

She removed the saucer filled with sugar, leaving a few pieces on the table-cloth; Nanon carried off the egg-cup; Madame Grandet sat up like a frightened hare. It was evidently a panic, which amazed Charles, who was wholly unable to understand it.

“Why! what is the matter?” he asked.

“My father has come,” answered Eugenie.

“Well, what of that?”

Monsieur Grandet entered the room, threw his keen eye upon the table, upon Charles, and saw the whole thing.

“Ha! ha! so you have been making a feast for your nephew;very good, very good, very good indeed!” he said, without stuttering.“When the cat’s away, the mice will play.”

“Feast!” thought Charles, incapable of suspecting or imagining the rules and customs of the household.

“Give me my glass, Nanon,” said the master

Eugenie brought the glass. Grandet drew a horn-handled knife with a big blade from his breeches’ pocket, cut a slice of bread, took a small bit of butter, spread it carefully on the bread, and ate it standing. At this moment Charlie was sweetening his coffee. Pere Grandet saw the bits of sugar, looked at his wife, who turned pale, and made three steps forward; he leaned down to the poor woman’s ear and said—

“Where did you get all that sugar?”

“Nanon fetched it from Fessard’s; there was none.”

It is impossible to picture the profound interest the three women took in this mute scene. Nanon had left her kitchen and stood looking into the room to see what would happen. Charles, having tasted his coffee, found it bitter and glanced about for the sugar, which Grandet had already put away.

“What do you want?” said his uncle.

“The sugar.”

“Put in more milk,” answered the master of the house; “your coffee will taste sweeter.”

Eugenie took the saucer which Grandet had put away and placed it on the table, looking calmly at her father as she did so. Most assuredly, the Parisian woman who held a silken ladder with her feeble arms to facilitate the flight of her lover, showed no greater courage than Eugenie displayed when she replaced the sugar upon the table. The lover rewarded his mistress when she proudly showed him her beautiful bruised arm, and bathed every swollen vein with tears and kisses till it was cured with happiness. Charles, on the other hand, never so much as knew the secret of the cruel agitation that shook and bruised the heart of his cousin, crushed as it was by the look of the old miser.

“You are not eating your breakfast, wife.”

The poor helot came forward with a piteous look, cut herself a piece of bread, and took a pear. Eugenie boldly offered her father some grapes, saying—

“Taste my preserves, papa. My cousin, you will eat some, will you not? I went to get these pretty grapes expressly for you.”

“If no one stops them, they will pillage Saumur for you, nephew. When you have finished, we will go into the garden; I have something to tell you which can’t be sweetened.”

Eugenie and her mother cast a look on Charles whose meaning the young man could not mistake.

“What is it you mean, uncle? Since the death of my poor mother”—at these words his voice softened—”no other sorrow can touch me.”

“My nephew, who knows by what afflictions God is pleased to try us?” said his aunt.

“Ta, ta, ta, ta,” said Grandet, “there’s your nonsense beginning. I am sorry to see those white hands of yours, nephew”;

and he showed the shoulder-of-mutton fists which Nature had put at the end of his own arms.

“There’s a pair of hands made to pick up silver pieces. You’ve been brought up to put your feet in the kid out of which we make the purses we keep our money in. A bad look-out! Very bad!”

“What do you mean, uncle? I’ll be hanged if I understand a single word of what you are saying.”

“Come!” said Grandet.

The miser closed the blade of his knife with a snap, drank the last of his wine, and opened the door.

“My cousin, take courage!”

The tone of the young girl struck terror to Charles’s heart, and he followed his terrible uncle, a prey to disquieting thoughts. Eugenie, her mother, and Nanon went into the kitchen, moved by irresistible curiosity to watch the two actors in the scene which was about to take place in the garden, where at first the uncle walked silently ahead of the nephew.

Grandet was not at all troubled at having to tell Charles of the death of his father; but he did feel a sort of compassion in knowing him to be without a penny, and he sought for some phrase or formula by which to soften the communication of that cruel truth. “You have lost your father,” seemed to him a mere nothing to say; fathers die before their children. But “you are absolutely without means,” —all the misfortunes of life were summed up in those words! Grandet walked round the garden three times, the gravel crunching under his heavy step. In the crucial moments of life our minds fasten upon the locality where joys or sorrows overwhelm us. Charles noticed with minute attention the box-borders of the little garden, the yellow leaves as they fluttered down, the dilapidated walls, the gnarled fruit-trees—picturesque details which were destined to remain forever in his memory, blending eternally, by the mnemonics that belong exclusively to the passions, with the recollections of this solemn hour.

“It is very fine weather, very warm,” said Grandet, drawing a long breath.

“Yes, uncle; but why—”

“Well, my lad,” answered his uncle, “I have some bad news to give you. Your father is ill—”

“Then why am I here?” said Charles. “Nanon,” he cried, “order post-horses! I can get a carriage somewhere?” he added, turning to his uncle, who stood motionless.

“Horses and carriages are useless,” answered Grandet, looking at Charles, who remained silent, his eyes growing fixed. “Yes, my poor boy, you guess the truth—he is dead. But that’s nothing; there is something worse: he blew out his brains.”

“My father!”

“Yes, but that’s not the worst; the newspapers are all talking about it. Here, read that.”

Grandet, who had borrowed the fatal article from Cruchot, thrust the paper under his nephew’s eyes. The poor young man, still a child, still at an age when feelings wear no mask, burst into tears.

“That’s good!” thought Grandet; “His eyes frightened me. He’ll be all right if he weeps—That is not the worst, my poor nephew,” he said aloud, not noticing whether Charles heard him, “that is nothing;you will get over it: but—”

“Never, never! My father! Oh, my father!”

“He has ruined you, you haven’t a penny.”

“What does that matter? My father! Where is my father?”

His sobs resounded horribly against those dreary walls and reverberated in the echoes. The three women, filled with pity, wept also; for tears are often as contagious as laughter. Charles, without listening further to his uncle, ran through the court and up the staircase to his chamber, where he threw himself across the bed and hid his face in the sheets, to weep in peace for his lost parents.

“The first burst must have its way,” said Grandet, entering the living-room, where Eugenie and her mother had hastily resumed their seats and were sewing with trembling hands, after wiping their eyes. “But that young man is good for nothing; his head is more taken up with the dead than with his money.”

Eugenie shuddered as she heard her father’s comment on the most sacred of all griefs. From that moment she began to judge him. Charles’s sobs, though muffled, still sounded through the sepulchral house; and his deep groans, which seemed to come from the earth beneath, only ceased towards evening, after growing gradually feebler.

“Poor young man!” said Madame Grandet.

Fatal exclamation! Pere Grandet looked at his wife, at Eugenie, and at the sugar-bowl. He recollected the extraordinary breakfast prepared for the unfortunate youth, and he took a position in the middle of the room.

“Listen to me,” he said, with his usual composure. “I hope that you will not continue this extravagance, Madame Grandet. I don’t give you MY money to stuff that young fellow with sugar.”

“My mother had nothing to do with it,” said Eugenie; “it was I who—”

“Is it because you are of age,” said Grandet, interrupting his daughter, “that you choose to contradict me? Remember, Eugenie—”

“Father, the son of your brother ought to receive from us—”

“Ta, ta, ta, ta!” exclaimed the cooper on four chromatic tones;“the son of my brother this, my nephew that! Charles is nothing at all to us; he hasn’t a farthing, his father has failed; and when this dandy has cried his fill, off he goes from here. I won’t have him revolutionize my household.”

“What is ‘failing,’ father?” asked Eugenie.

“To fail,” answered her father, “is to commit the most dishonorable action that can disgrace a man.”

“It must be a great sin,” said Madame Grandet, “and our brother may be damned.”

“There, there, don’t begin with your litanies!” said Grandet, shrugging his shoulders. “To fail, Eugenie,” he resumed, “is to commit a theft which the law, unfortunately, takes under its protection. People have given their property to Guillaume Grandet trusting to his reputation for honor and integrity; he has made away with it all, and left them nothing but their eyes to weep with. A highway robber is better than a bankrupt: the one attacks you and you can defend yourself, he risks his own life; but the other—in short, Charles is dishonored.”

The words rang in the poor girl’s heart and weighed it down with their heavy meaning. Upright and delicate as a flower born in the depths of a forest, she knew nothing of the world’s maxims, of its deceitful arguments and specious sophisms; she therefore believed the atrocious explanation which her father gave her designedly, concealing the distinction which exists between an involuntary failure and an intentional one.

“Father, could you not have prevented such a misfortune?”

“My brother did not consult me. Besides, he owes four millions.”

“What is a ‘million,’ father?” she asked, with the simplicity of a child which thinks it can find out at once all that it wants to know.

“A million?” said Grandet, “why, it is a million pieces of twenty sous each, and it takes five twenty sous pieces to make five francs.”

“Dear me!” cried Eugenie, “how could my uncle possibly have had four millions? Is there any one else in France who ever had so many millions?”

Pere Grandet stroked his chin, smiled, and his wen seemed to dilate.

“But what will become of my cousin Charles?”

“He is going off to the West Indies by his father’s request, and he will try to make his fortune there.”

“Has he got the money to go with?”

“I shall pay for his journey as far as—yes, as far as Nantes.”

Eugenie sprang into his arms.

“Oh, father, how good you are!”

She kissed him with a warmth that almost made Grandet ashamed of himself, for his conscience galled him a little.

“Will it take much time to amass a million?” she asked.

“Look here!” said the old miser, “you know what a napoleon is? Well, it takes fifty thousand napoleons to make a million.”

“Mamma, we must say a great many neuvaines for him.”

“I was thinking so,” said Madame Grandet.

“That’s the way, always spending my money!” cried the father.“Do you think there are francs on every bush?”

At this moment a muffled cry, more distressing than all the others, echoed through the garrets and struck a chill to the hearts of Eugenie and her mother.

“Nanon, go upstairs and see that he does not kill himself,” said Grandet. “Now, then,” he added, looking at his wife and daughter, who had turned pale at his words, “no nonsense, you two! I must leave you; I have got to see about the Dutchmen who are going away to-day. And then I must find Cruchot, and talk with him about all this.”

He departed. As soon as he had shut the door Eugenie and her mother breathed more freely. Until this morning the young girl had never felt constrained in the presence of her father; but for the last few hours every moment wrought a change in her feelings and ideas.

“Mamma, how many louis are there in a cask of wine?”

“Your father sells his from a hundred to a hundred and fifty francs, sometimes two hundred—at least, so I’ve heard say.”

“Then papa must be rich?”

“Perhaps he is. But Monsieur Cruchot told me he bought Froidfond two years ago; that may have pinched him.”

Eugenie, not being able to understand the question of her father’s fortune, stopped short in her calculations.

“He didn’t even see me, the darling!” said Nanon, coming back from her errand. “He’s stretched out like a calf on his bed and crying like the Madeleine, and that’s a blessing! What’s the matter with the poor dear young man!”

“Let us go and console him, mamma; if any one knocks, we can come down.”

Madame Grandet was helpless against the sweet persuasive tones of her daughter’s voice. Eugenie was sublime: she had become a woman.

The two, with beating hearts, went up to Charles’s room. The door was open. The young man heard and saw nothing; plunged in grief, he only uttered inarticulate cries.

“How he loves his father!” said Eugenie in a low voice.

In the utterance of those words it was impossible to mistake the hopes of a heart that, unknown to itself, had suddenly become passionate. Madame Grandet cast a mother’s look upon her daughter, and then whispered in her ear—

“Take care, you will love him!”

“Love him!” answered Eugenie. “Ah! if you did but know what my father said to Monsieur Cruchot.”

Charles turned over, and saw his aunt and cousin.

“I have lost my father, my poor father! If he had told me his secret troubles we might have worked together to repair them. My God! my poor father! I was so sure I should see him again that I think I kissed him quite coldly—”

Sobs cut short the words.

“We will pray for him,” said Madame Grandet. “Resign yourself to the will of God.”

“Cousin,” said Eugenie, “take courage! Your loss is irreparable;therefore think only of saving your honor.”

With the delicate instinct of a woman who intuitively puts her mind into all things, even at the moment when she offers consolation, Eugenie sought to cheat her cousin’s grief by turning his thoughts inward upon himself.

“My honor?” exclaimed the young man, tossing aside his hair with an impatient gesture as he sat up on his bed and crossed his arms.

“Ah! that is true. My uncle said my father had failed.”

He uttered a heart-rending cry, and hid his face in his hands.

“Leave me, leave me, cousin! My God! my God! Forgive my father, for he must have suffered sorely!”

There was something terribly attractive in the sight of this young sorrow, sincere without reasoning or afterthought. It was a virgin grief which the simple hearts of Eugenie and her mother were fitted to comprehend, and they obeyed the sign Charles made them to leave him to himself. They went downstairs in silence and took their accustomed places by the window and sewed for nearly an hour without exchanging a word. Eugenie had seen in the furtive glance that she cast about the young man’s room—that girlish glance which sees all in the twinkling of an eye—the pretty trifles of his dressing-case, his scissors, his razors embossed with gold. This gleam of luxury across her cousin’s grief only made him the more interesting to her, possibly by way of contrast. Never before had so serious an event, so dramatic a sight, touched the imaginations of these two passive beings, hitherto sunk in the stillness and calm of solitude.

“Mamma,” said Eugenie, “we must wear mourning for my uncle.”

“Your father will decide that,” answered Madame Grandet.

They relapsed into silence. Eugenie drew her stitches with a uniform motion which revealed to an observer the teeming thoughts of her meditation. The first desire of the girl’s heart was to share her cousin’s mourning.

About four o’clock an abrupt knock at the door struck sharply on the heart of Madame Grandet.

“What can have happened to your father?” she said to her daughter.

Grandet entered joyously. After taking off his gloves, he rubbed his hands hard enough to take off their skin as well, if his epidermis had not been tanned and cured like Russia leather—saving, of course, the perfume of larch-trees and incense. Presently his secret escaped him.

“Wife,” he said, without stuttering, “I’ve trapped them all! Our wine is sold! The Dutch and the Belgians have gone. I walked about the market-place in front of their inn, pretending to be doing nothing. That Belgian fellow—you know who I mean—came up to me. The owners of all the good vineyards have kept back their vintages, intending to wait; well, I didn’t hinder them. The Belgian was in despair; I saw that. In a minute the bargain was made. He takes my vintage at two hundred francs the puncheon, half down. He paid me in gold; the notes are drawn. Here are six louis for you. In three months wines will have fallen.”

These words, uttered in a quiet tone of voice, were nevertheless so bitterly sarcastic that the inhabitants of Saumur, grouped at this moment in the market-place and overwhelmed by the news of the sale Grandet had just effected, would have shuddered had they heard them. Their panic would have brought the price of wines down fifty per cent at once.

“Did you have a thousand puncheons this year, father?”

“Yes, little one.”

That term applied to his daughter was the superlative expression of the old miser’s joy.

“Then that makes two hundred thousand pieces of twenty sous each?”

“Yes, Mademoiselle Grandet.”

“Then, father, you can easily help Charles.”

The amazement, the anger, the stupefaction of Belshazzar when he saw the Mene-Tekel-Upharsinbefore his eyes is not to be compared with the cold rage of Grandet, who, having forgotten his nephew, now found him enshrined in the heart and calculations of his daughter.

“What’s this? Ever since that dandy put foot in my house everything goes wrong! You behave as if you had the right to buy sugar-plums and make feasts and weddings. I won’t have that sort of thing. I hope I know my duty at my time of life! I certainly sha’n’t take lessons from my daughter, or from anybody else. I shall do for my nephew what it is proper to do, and you have no need to poke your nose into it. As for you, Eugenie,” he added, facing her, “don’t speak of this again, or I’ll send you to the Abbaye des Noyers with Nanon, see if I don’t; and no later than to-morrow either, if you disobey me! Where is that fellow, has he come down yet?”

“No, my friend,” answered Madame Grandet.

“What is he doing then?”

“He is weeping for his father,” said Eugenie.

Grandet looked at his daughter without finding a word to say;after all, he was a father. He made a couple of turns up and down the room, and then went hurriedly to his secret den to think over an investment he was meditating in the public Funds. The thinning out of his two thousand acres of forest land had yielded him six hundred thousand francs: putting this sum to that derived from the sale of his poplars and to his other gains for the last year and for the current year, he had amassed a total of nine hundred thousand francs, without counting the two hundred thousand he had got by the sale just concluded. The twenty per cent which Cruchot assured him would gain in a short time from the Funds, then quoted at seventy, tempted him. He figured out his calculation on the margin of the newspaper which gave the account of his brother’s death, all the while hearing the moans of his nephew, but without listening to them.

Nanon came and knocked on the wall to summon him to dinner. On the last step of the staircase he was saying to himself as he came down—

“I’ll do it; I shall get eight per cent interest. In two years I shall have fifteen hundred thousand francs, which I will then draw out in good gold—Well, where’s my nephew?”

“He says he doesn’t want anything to eat,” answered Nanon;“that’s not good for him.”

“So much saved,” retorted her master.

“That’s so,” she said.

“Bah! he won’t cry long. Hunger drives the wolves out of the woods.”

The dinner was eaten in silence.

“My good friend,” said Madame Grandet, when the cloth was removed, “we must put on mourning.”

“Upon my word, Madame Grandet! what will you invent next to spend money on? Mourning is in the heart, and not in the clothes.”

“But mourning for a brother is indispensable; and the Church commands us to—”

“Buy your mourning out of your six louis. Give me a hat-band;that’s enough for me.”

Eugenie raised her eyes to heaven without uttering a word. Her generous instincts, slumbering and long repressed but now suddenly and for the first time awakened, were galled at every turn.

The evening passed to all appearance like a thousand other evenings of their monotonous life, yet it was certainly the most horrible. Eugenie sewed without raising her head, and did not use the workbox which Charles had despised the night before. Madame Grandet knitted her sleeves. Grandet twirled his thumbs for four hours, absorbed in calculations whose results were on the morrow to astonish Saumur.

No one came to visit the family that day. The whole town was ringing with the news of the business trick just played by Grandet, the failure of his brother, and the arrival of his nephew. Obeying the desire to gossip over their mutual interests, all the upper and middle-class wine-growers in Saumur met at Monsieur des Grassins, where terrible imprecations were being fulminated against the ex-mayor.

Nanon was spinning, and the whirr of her wheel was the only sound heard beneath the gray rafters of that silent hall.

“We don’t waste our tongues,” she said, showing her teeth, as large and white as peeled almonds.

“Nothing should be wasted,” answered Grandet, rousing himself from his reverie.

He saw a perspective of eight millions in three years, and he was sailing along that sheet of gold.

“Let us go to bed. I will bid my nephew good-night for the rest of you, and see if he will take anything.”

Madame Grandet remained on the landing of the first storey to hear the conversation that was about to take place between the goodman and his nephew. Eugenie, bolder than her mother, went up two stairs.

“Well, nephew, you are in trouble. Yes, weep, that’s natural. A father is a father; but we must bear our troubles patiently. I am a good uncle to you, remember that. Come, take courage! Will you have a little glass of wine?”

(Wine costs nothing in Saumur, and they offer it as tea is offered in China.)

“Why!” added Grandet, “you have got no light! That’s bad, very bad; you ought to see what you are about,” and he walked to the chimney-piece.

“What’s this?” he cried. “A wax candle! How the devil did they filch a wax candle? The spendthrifts would tear down the ceilings of my house to boil the fellow’s eggs.”

Hearing these words, mother and daughter slipped back into their rooms and burrowed in their beds, with the celerity of frightened mice getting back to their holes.

“Madame Grandet, have you found a mine?” said the man, coming into the chamber of his wife.

“My friend, wait; I am saying my prayers,” said the poor mother in a trembling voice.

“The devil take your good God!” growled Grandet in reply.

Misers have no belief in a future life; the present is their all in all. This thought casts a terrible light upon our present epoch, in which, far more than at any former period, money sways the laws and politics and morals. Institutions, books, men, and dogmas, all conspire to undermine belief in a future life—a belief upon which the social edifice has rested for eighteen hundred years. The grave, as a means of transition, is little feared in our day. The future, which once opened to us beyond the requiems, has now been imported into the present. To obtain per fas et nefas a terrestrial paradise of luxury and earthly enjoyment, to harden the heart and macerate the body for the sake of fleeting possessions, as the martyrs once suffered all things to reach eternal joys, this is now the universal thought—a thought written everywhere, even in the very laws which ask of the legislator, “What do you pay?” instead of asking him, “What do you think?” When this doctrine has passed down from the bourgeoisie to the populace, where will this country be?

“Madame Grandet, have you done?” asked the old man.

“My friend, I am praying for you.”

“Very good! Good-night; to-morrow morning we will have a talk.”

The poor woman went to sleep like a schoolboy who, not having learned his lessons, knows he will see his master’s angry face on the morrow. At the moment when, filled with fear, she was drawing the sheet above her head that she might stifle hearing, Eugenie, in her night-gown and with naked feet, ran to her side and kissed her brow.

“Oh! my good mother,” she said, “to-morrow I will tell him it was I.”

“No; he would send you to Noyers. Leave me to manage it; he cannot eat me.”

“Do you hear, mamma?”

“What?”

“He is weeping still.”

“Go to bed, my daughter; you will take cold in your feet: the floor is damp.”

Thus passed the solemn day which was destined to weight upon the whole life of the rich and poor heiress, whose sleep was never again to be so calm, nor yet so pure, as it had been up to this moment.

It often happens that certain actions of human life seem, literally speaking, improbable, though actual. Is not this because we constantly omit to turn the stream of psychological light upon our impulsive determinations, and fail to explain the subtile reasons, mysteriously conceived in our minds, which impelled them? Perhaps Eugenie’s deep passion should be analyzed in its most delicate fibres; for it became, scoffers might say, a malady which influenced her whole existence. Many people prefer to deny results rather than estimate the force of ties and links and bonds, which secretly join one fact to another in the moral order. Here, therefore, Eugenie’s past life will offer to observers of human nature an explanation of her naive want of reflection and the suddenness of the emotions which overflowed her soul. The more tranquil her life had been, the more vivid was her womanly pity, the more simple-minded were the sentiments now developed in her soul. Made restless by the events of the day, she woke at intervals to listen to her cousin, thinking she heard the sighs which still echoed in her heart. Sometimes she saw him dying of his trouble, sometimes she dreamed that he fainted from hunger. Towards morning she was certain that she heard a startling cry. She dressed at once and ran, in the dawning light, with a swift foot to her cousin’s chamber, the door of which he had left open. The candle had burned down to the socket. Charles, overcome by nature, was sleeping, dressed and sitting in an armchair beside the bed, on which his head rested; he dreamed as men dream on an empty stomach. Eugenie might weep at her ease; she might admire the young and handsome face blotted with grief, the eyes swollen with weeping, that seemed, sleeping as they were, to well forth tears. Charles felt sympathetically the young girl’s presence; he opened his eyes and saw her pitying him.

“Pardon me, my cousin,” he said, evidently not knowing the hour nor the place in which he found himself.

“There are hearts who hear you, cousin, and we thought you might need something. You should go to bed; you tire yourself by sitting thus.”

“That is true.”

“Well, then, adieu!”

She escaped, ashamed and happy at having gone there. Innocence alone can dare to be so bold. Once enlightened, virtue makes her calculations as well as vice. Eugenie, who had not trembled beside her cousin, could scarcely stand upon her legs when she regained her chamber. Her ignorant life had suddenly come to an end; she reasoned, she rebuked herself with many reproaches.“What will he think of me? He will think that I love him!” That was what she most wished him to think. An honest love has its own prescience, and knows that love begets love. What an event for this poor solitary girl thus to have entered the chamber of a young man! Are there not thoughts and actions in the life of love which to certain souls bear the full meaning of the holiest espousals?

An hour later she went to her mother and dressed her as usual. Then they both came down and sat in their places before the window waiting for Grandet, with that cruel anxiety which, according to the individual character, freezes the heart or warms it, shrivels or dilates it, when a scene is feared, a punishment expected—a feeling so natural that even domestic animals possess it, and whine at the slightest pain of punishment, though they make no outcry when they inadvertently hurt themselves. The goodman came down; but he spoke to his wife with an absent manner, kissed Eugenie, and sat down to table without appearing to remember his threats of the night before.

“What has become of my nephew? The lad gives no trouble.”

“Monsieur, he is asleep,” answered Nanon.

“So much the better; he won’t want a wax candle,” said Grandet in a jeering tone.

This unusual clemency, this bitter gaiety, struck Madame Grandet with amazement, and she looked at her husband attentively. The goodman—here it may be well to explain that in Touraine, Anjou, Pitou, and Bretagne the word “goodman,” already used to designate Grandet, is bestowed as often upon harsh and cruel men as upon those of kindly temperament, when either have reached a certain age; the title means nothing on the score of individual gentleness—the goodman took his hat and gloves, saying as he went out—

“I am going to loiter about the market-place and find Cruchot.”

“Eugenie, your father certainly has something on his mind.”

Grandet, who was a poor sleeper, employed half his nights in the preliminary calculations which gave such astonishing accuracy to his views and observations and schemes, and secured to them the unfailing success at sight of which his townsmen stood amazed. All human power is a compound of time and patience. Powerful beings will and wait. The life of a miser is the constant exercise of human power put to the service of self. It rests on two sentiments only—self-love and self-interest; but self-interest being to a certain extent compact and intelligent self-love, the visible sign of real superiority, it follows that self-love and self-interest are two parts of the same whole—egotism. From this arises, perhaps, the excessive curiosity shown in the habits of a miser’s life whenever they are put before the world. Every nature holds by a thread to those beings who challenge all human sentiments by concentrating all in one passion. Where is the man without desire? and what social desire can be satisfied without money?

Grandet unquestionably “had something on his mind,” to use his wife’s expression. There was in him, as in all misers, a persistent craving to play a commercial game with other men and win their money legally. To impose upon other people was to him a sign of power, a perpetual proof that he had won the right to despise those feeble beings who suffer themselves to be preyed upon in this world. Oh! who has ever truly understood the lamb lying peacefully at the feet of God?—touching emblem of all terrestrial victims, myth of their future, suffering and weakness glorified! This lamb it is which the miser fattens, puts in his fold, slaughters, cooks, eats, and then despises. The pasture of misers is compounded of money and disdain.

During the night Grandet’s ideas had taken another course, which was the reason of his sudden clemency. He had hatched a plot by which to trick the Parisians, to decoy and dupe and snare them, to drive them into a trap, and make them go and come and sweat and hope and turn pale—a plot by which to amuse himself, the old provincial cooper, sitting there beneath his gloomy rafters, or passing up and down the rotten staircase of his house in Saumur. His nephew filled his mind. He wished to save the honor of his dead brother without the cost of a penny to the son or to himself. His own funds he was about to invest for three years; he had therefore nothing further to do than to manage his property in Saumur. He needed some nutriment for his malicious activity, and he found it suddenly in his brother’s failure. Feeling nothing to squeeze between his own paws, he resolved to crush the Parisians in behalf of Charles, and to play the part of a good brother on the cheapest terms. The honor of the family counted for so little in this scheme that his good intentions might be likened to the interest a gambler takes in seeing a game well played in which he has no stake. The Cruchots were a necessary part of his plan; but he would not seek them—he resolved to make them come to him, and to lead up that very evening to a comedy whose plot he had just conceived, which should make him on the morrow an object of admiration to the whole town without its costing him a single penny.





IV


In her father’s absence Eugenie had the happiness of busying herself openly with her much-loved cousin, of spending upon him fearlessly the treasures of her pity—woman’s sublime superiority, the sole she desires to have recognized, the sole she pardons man for letting her assume. Three or four times the young girl went to listen to her cousin’s breathing, to know if he were sleeping or awake;then, when he had risen, she turned her thoughts to the cream, the eggs, the fruits, the plates, the glasses—all that was a part of his breakfast became the object of some special care. At length she ran lightly up the old staircase to listen to the noise her cousin made. Was he dressing? Did he still weep? She reached the door.

“My cousin!”

“Yes, cousin.”

“Will you breakfast downstairs, or in your room?”

“Where you like.”

“How do you feel?”

“Dear cousin, I am ashamed of being hungry.”

This conversation, held through the closed door, was like an episode in a poem to Eugenie.

“Well, then, we will bring your breakfast to your own room, so as not to annoy my father.”

She ran to the kitchen with the swiftness and lightness of a bird.

“Nanon, go and do his room!”

That staircase, so often traversed, which echoed to the slightest noise, now lost its decaying aspect in the eyes of Eugenie. It grew luminous; it had a voice and spoke to her; it was young like herself—young like the love it was now serving. Her mother, her kind, indulgent mother, lent herself to the caprices of the child’s love, and after the room was put in order, both went to sit with the unhappy youth and keep him company. Does not Christian charity make consolation a duty? The two women drew a goodly number of little sophistries from their religion wherewith to justify their conduct.

Charles was made the object of the tenderest and most loving care. His saddened heart felt the sweetness of the gentle friendship, the exquisite sympathy which these two souls, crushed under perpetual restraint, knew so well how to display when, for an instant, they were left unfettered in the regions of suffering, their natural sphere. Claiming the right of relationship, Eugenie began to fold the linen and put in order the toilet articles which Charles had brought;thus she could marvel at her ease over each luxurious bauble and the various knick-knacks of silver or chased gold, which she held long in her hand under a pretext of examining them. Charles could not see without emotion the generous interest his aunt and cousin felt in him; he knew society in Paris well enough to feel assured that, placed as he now was, he would find all hearts indifferent or cold. Eugenie thus appeared to him in the splendor of a special beauty, and from thenceforth he admired the innocence of life and manners which the previous evening he had been inclined to ridicule. So when Eugenie took from Nanon the bowl of coffee and cream, and began to pour it out for her cousin with the simplicity of real feeling, giving him a kindly glance, the eyes of the Parisian filled with tears;he took her hand and kissed it.

“What troubles you?” she said.

“Oh! These are tears of gratitude,” he answered.

Eugenie turned abruptly to the chimney-piece to take the candlesticks.

“Here, Nanon, carry them away!” she said.

When she looked again towards her cousin she was still blushing, but her looks could at least deceive, and did not betray the excess of joy which innundated her heart; yet the eyes of both expressed the same sentiment as their souls flowed together in one thought—the future was theirs.

This soft emotion was all the more precious to Charles in the midst of his heavy grief because it was wholly unexpected. The sound of the knocker recalled the women to their usual station. Happily they were able to run downstairs with sufficient rapidity to be seated at their work when Grandet entered; had he met them under the archway it would have been enough to rouse his suspicions. After breakfast, which the goodman took standing, the keeper from Froidfond, to whom the promised indemnity had never yet been paid, made his appearance, bearing a hare and some partridges shot in the park, with eels and two pike sent as tribute by the millers.

“Ha, ha! Poor Cornoiller; here he comes, like fish in Lent. Is all that fit to eat?”

“Yes, my dear, generous master; it has been killed for two days.”

“Come, Nanon, bestir yourself,” said Grandet; “take these things, they’ll do for dinner. I have invited the two Cruchots.”

Nanon opened her eyes, stupid with amazement, and looked at everybody in the room.

“Well!” she said, “And how am I to get the lard and the spices?”

“Wife,” said Grandet, “give Nanon six francs, and remind me to get some of the good wine out of the cellar.”

“Well, then, Monsieur Grandet,” said the keeper, who had come prepared with an harangue for the purpose of settling the question of the indemnity, “Monsieur Grandet—”

“Ta, ta, ta, ta!” said Grandet; “I know what you want to say. You are a good fellow; we will see about it to-morrow, I’m too busy to-day. Wife, give him five francs,” he added to Madame Grandet as he decamped.

The poor woman was only too happy to buy peace at the cost of eleven francs. She knew that Grandet would let her alone for a fortnight after he had thus taken back, franc by franc, the money he had given her.

“Here, Cornoiller,” she said, slipping ten francs into the man’s hand, “some day we will reward your services.”

Cornoiller could say nothing, so he went away.

“Madame,” said Nanon, who had put on her black coif and taken her basket, “I want only three francs. You keep the rest; it’ll go fast enough somehow.”

“Have a good dinner, Nanon; my cousin will come down,” said Eugenie.

“Something very extraordinary is going on, I am certain of it,” said Madame Grandet. “This is only the third time since our marriage that your father has given a dinner.”

About four o’clock, just as Eugenie and her mother had finished setting the table for six persons, and after the master of the house had brought up a few bottles of the exquisite wine which provincials cherish with true affection, Charles came down into the hall. The young fellow was pale; his gestures, the expression of his face, his glance, and the tones of his voice, all had a sadness which was full of grace. He was not pretending grief, he truly suffered; and the veil of pain cast over his features gave him an interesting air dear to the heart of women. Eugenie loved him the more for it. Perhaps she felt that sorrow drew him nearer to her. Charles was no longer the rich and distinguished young man placed in a sphere far above her, but a relation plunged into frightful misery. Misery begets equality. Women have this in common with the angels—suffering humanity belongs to them. Charles and Eugenie understood each other and spoke only with their eyes; for the poor fallen dandy, orphaned and impoverished, sat apart in a corner of the room, and was proudly calm and silent. Yet, from time to time, the gentle and caressing glance of the young girl shone upon him and constrained him away from his sad thoughts, drawing him with her into the fields of hope and of futurity, where she loved to hold him at her side.

At this moment the town of Saumur was more excited about the dinner given by Grandet to the Cruchots than it had been the night before at the sale of his vintage, though that constituted a crime of high-treason against the whole wine-growing community. If the politic old miser had given his dinner from the same idea that cost the dog of Alcibiades his tail, he might perhaps have been called a great man; but the fact is, considering himself superior to a community which he could trick on all occasions, he paid very little heed to what Saumur might say. The des Grassins soon learned the facts of the failure and the violent death of Guillaume Grandet, and they determined to go to their client’s house that very evening to commiserate his misfortune and show him some marks of friendship, with a view of ascertaining the motives which had led him to invite the Cruchots to dinner.

At precisely five o’clock Monsieur C. de Bonfons and his uncle the notary arrived in their Sunday clothes. The party sat down to table and began to dine with good appetites. Grandet was grave, Charles silent, Eugenie dumb, and Madame Grandet did not say more than usual; so that the dinner was, very properly, a repast of condolence.

When they rose from table Charles said to his aunt and uncle—

“Will you permit me to retire? I am obliged to undertake a long and painful correspondence.”

“Certainly, nephew.”

As soon as the goodman was certain that Charles could hear nothing and was probably deep in his letter-writing, he said, with a dissimulating glance at his wife—

“Madame Grandet, what we have to talk about will be Latin to you; it is half-past seven; you can go and attend to your household accounts. Good-night, my daughter.”

He kissed Eugenie, and the two women departed. A scene now took place in which Pere Grandet brought to bear, more than at any other moment of his life, the shrewd dexterity he had acquired in his intercourse with men, and which had won him from those whose flesh he sometimes bit too sharply the nickname of “the old dog.” If the mayor of Saumur had carried his ambition higher still, if fortunate circumstances, drawing him towards the higher social spheres, had sent him into congresses where the affairs of nations were discussed, and had he there employed the genius with which his personal interests had endowed him, he would undoubtedly have proved nobly useful to his native land. Yet it is perhaps equally certain that outside of Saumur the goodman would have cut a very sorry figure. Possibly there are minds like certain animals which cease to breed when transplanted from the climates in which they are born.

“M…m…mon…sieur le p…p…president, you said t…t…that b…b…bankruptcy—”

The stutter which for years the old miser had assumed when it suited him, and which, together with the deafness of which he sometimes complained in rainy weather, was thought in Saumur to be a natural defect, became at this crisis so wearisome to the two Cruchots that while they listened they unconsciously made faces and moved their lips, as if pronouncing the words over which he was hesitating and stuttering at will. Here it may be well to give the history of this impediment of the speech and hearing of Monsieur Grandet.

No one in Anjou heard better, or could pronounce more crisply the French language (with an Angevin accent) than the wily old cooper. Some years earlier, in spite of his shrewdness, he had been taken in by an Israelite, who in the course of the discussion held his hand behind his ear to catch sounds, and mangled his meaning so thoroughly in trying to utter his words that Grandet fell a victim to his humanity and was compelled to prompt the wily Jew with the words and ideas he seemed to seek, to complete himself the arguments of the said Jew, to say what that cursed Jew ought to have said for himself; in short, to be the Jew instead of being Grandet. When the cooper came out of this curious encounter he had concluded the only bargain of which in the course of a long commercial life he ever had occasion to complain. But if he lost at the time pecuniarily, he gained morally a valuable lesson; later, he gathered its fruits. Indeed, the goodman ended by blessing that Jew for having taught him the art of irritating his commercial antagonist and leading him to forget his own thoughts in his impatience to suggest those over which his tormentor was stuttering.

No affair had ever needed the assistance of deafness, impediments of speech, and all the incomprehensible circumlocutions with which Grandet enveloped his ideas, as much as the affair now in hand. In the first place, he did not mean to shoulder the responsibility of his own scheme; in the next, he was determined to remain master of the conversation and to leave his real intentions in doubt.

“M…m…monsieur de B…B…Bonfons,” —

For the second time in three years Grandet called the Cruchot nephew Monsieur de Bonfons; the president felt he might consider himself the artful old fellow’s son-in-law—

“You…ou said th…th…that b…b…bankruptcy c…c…could, in some c…c…cases, b…b…be p…p…prevented b…b…by—”

“By the courts of commerce themselves. It is done constantly,”said Monsieur C. de Bonfons, bestriding Grandet’s meaning, or thinking he guessed it, and kindly wishing to help him out with it.“Listen.”

“Y…yes,” said Grandet humbly, with the mischievous expression of a boy who is inwardly laughing at his teacher while he pays him the greatest attention.

“When a man so respected and important as, for example, your late brother—”

“M…my b…b…brother, yes.”

“Is threatened with insolvency—”

“They c…c…call it in…ins…s…solvency?”

“Yes; when his failure is imminent, the court of commerce, to which he is amenable (please follow me attentively), has the power, by a decree, to appoint a receiver. Liquidation, you understand, is not the same as failure. When a man fails, he is dishonored; but when he merely liquidates, he remains an honest man.”

“T…t…that’s very d…d…different, if it d…d…doesn’t c…c…cost m…m…more,” said Grandet.

“But a liquidation can be managed without having recourse to the courts at all. For,” said the president, sniffing a pinch of snuff,“don’t you know how failures are declared?”

“N…n…no, I n…n…never t…t…thought,” answered Grandet.

“In the first place,” resumed the magistrate, “by filing the schedule in the record office of the court, which the merchant may do himself, or his representative for him with a power of attorney duly certified. In the second place, the failure may be declared under compulsion from the creditors. Now if the merchant does not file his schedule, and if no creditor appears before the courts to obtain a decree of insolvency against the merchant, what happens?”

“W…w…what h…h…happens?”

“Why, the family of the deceased, his representatives, his heirs, or the merchant himself, if he is not dead, or his friends if he is only hiding, liquidate his business. Perhaps you would like to liquidate your brother’s affairs?”

“Ah! Grandet,” said the notary, “that would be the right thing to do. There is honor down here in the provinces. If you save your name—for it is your name—you will be a man—”

“A noble man!” cried the president, interrupting his uncle.

“Certainly,” answered the old man, “my b…b…brother’s name was G…G…Grandet, like m…m…mine. Th…that’s c…c…certain;I d…d…don’t d…d…deny it. And th…th…this l…l…liquidation might be, in m…m…many ways, v…v…very advan…t…t…tageous t…t…to the interests of m…m…my n…n…nephew, whom I l…l…love. But I must consider. I don’t k…k…know the t…t…tricks of P…P…Paris. I b…b…belong to Sau…m…mur, d…d…don’t you see? M…m…my vines, my d…d…drains—in short, I’ve my own b…b…business. I never g…g…give n…n…notes. What are n…n…notes? I t…t…take a good m…m…many, but I have never s…s…signed one. I d…d…don’t understand such things. I have h…h…heard say that n…n…notes c…c…can be b…b…bought up.”

“Of course,” said the president. “Notes can be bought in the market, less so much per cent. Don’t you understand?”

Grandet made an ear…trumpet of his hand, and the president repeated his words.

“Well, then,” replied the man, “there’s s…s…something to be g…g…got out of it? I k…know n…nothing at my age about such th…th…things. I l…l…live here and l…l…look after the v…v…vines. The vines g…g…grow, and it’s the w…w…wine that p…p…pays. L…l…look after the v…v…vintage, t…t…that’s my r…r…rule. My c…c…chief interests are at Froidfond. I c…c…can’t l…l…leave my h…h…house to m…m…muddle myself with a d…d…devilish b…b…business I kn…know n…n…nothing about. You say I ought to l…l…liquidate my b…b…brother’s af…f…fairs, to p…p…prevent the f…f…failure. I c…c…can’t be in two p…p…places at once, unless I were a little b…b…bird, and—”

“I understand,” cried the notary. “Well, my old friend, you have friends, old friends, capable of devoting themselves to your interests.”

“All right!” thought Grandet, “make haste and come to the point!”

“Suppose one of them went to Paris and saw your brother Guillaume’s chief creditor and said to him—”

“One m…m…moment,” interrupted the goodman, “said wh…wh…what? Something l…l…like this. Monsieur Gr…Grandet of Saumur this, Monsieur Grandet of Saumur that. He l…loves his b…b…brother, he loves his n…nephew. Grandet is a g…g…good uncle;he m…m…means well. He has sold his v…v…vintage. D…d…don’t declare a f…f…failure; c…c…call a meeting; l…l…liquidate;and then Gr…Gr…Grandet will see what he c…c…can do. B…b…better liquidate than l…let the l…l…law st…st…stick its n…n…nose in. Hein? isn’t it so?”

“Exactly so,” said the president.

“B…because, don’t you see, Monsieur de B…Bonfons, a man must l…l…look b…b…before he l…leaps. If you c…c…can’t, you c…c…can’t. M…m…must know all about the m…m…matter, all the resources and the debts, if you d…d…don’t want to be r…r…ruined. Hein? isn’t it so?”

“Certainly,” said the president. “I’m of opinion that in a few months the debts might be bought up for a certain sum, and then paid in full by an agreement. Ha! ha! you can coax a dog a long way if you show him a bit of lard. If there has been no declaration of failure, and you hold a lien on the debts, you come out of the business as white as the driven snow.”

“Sn…n…now,” said Grandet, putting his hand to his ear, “wh…wh…what about s…now?”

“But,” cried the president, “do pray attend to what I am saying.”

“I am at…t…tending.”

“A note is merchandise—an article of barter which rises and falls in prices. That is a deduction from Jeremy Bentham’s theory about usury. That writer has proved that the prejudice which condemned usurers to reprobation was mere folly.”

“Whew!” ejaculated the goodman.

“Allowing that money, according to Bentham, is an article of merchandise, and that whatever represents money is equally merchandise,” resumed the president; “allowing also that it is notorious that the commercial note, bearing this or that signature, is liable to the fluctuation of all commercial values, rises or falls in the market, is dear at one moment, and is worth nothing at another, the courts decide—ah! how stupid I am, I beg your pardon—I am inclined to think you could buy up your brother’s debts for twenty…five per cent.”

“D…d…did you c…c…call him Je…Je…Jeremy B…Ben?”

“Bentham, an Englishman.’

“That’s a Jeremy who might save us a lot of lamentations in business,” said the notary, laughing.

“Those Englishmen s…sometimes t…t…talk sense,” said Grandet. “So, ac…c…cording to Ben…Bentham, if my b…b…brother’s n…notes are worth n…n…nothing; if Je…Je—I’m c…c…correct, am I not? That seems c…c…clear to my m…m…mind—the c…c…creditors would be—No, would not be; I understand.”

“Let me explain it all,” said the president. “Legally, if you acquire a title to all the debts of the Maison Grandet, your brother or his heirs will owe nothing to any one. Very good.”

“Very g…good,” repeated Grandet.

“In equity, if your brother’s notes are negotiated—negotiated, do you clearly understand the term?—negotiated in the market at a reduction of so much per cent in value, and if one of your friends happening to be present should buy them in, the creditors having sold them of their own free…will without constraint, the estate of the late Grandet is honorably released.”

“That’s t…true; b…b…business is b…business,” said the cooper. “B…b…but, st…still, you know, it is d…d…difficult. I h…have n…no m…m…money and n…no t…t…time.”

“Yes, but you need not undertake it. I am quite ready to go to Paris (you may pay my expenses, they will only be a trifle). I will see the creditors and talk with them and get an extension of time, and everything can be arranged if you will add something to the assets so as to buy up all title to the debts.”

“We…we’ll see about th…that. I c…c…can’t and I w…w…won’t bind myself without—He who c…c…can’t, can’t; don’t you see?”

“That’s very true.”

“I’m all p…p…put ab…b…bout by what you’ve t…t…told me. This is the f…first t…t…time in my life I have b…been obliged to th…th…think—”

“Yes, you are not a lawyer.”

“I’m only a p…p…poor wine…g…grower, and know n…nothing about wh…what you have just t…told me; I m…m…must th…think about it.”

“Very good,” said the president, preparing to resume his argument.

“Nephew!” said the notary, interrupting him in a warning tone.

“Well, what, uncle?” answered the president.

“Let Monsieur Grandet explain his own intentions. The matter in question is of the first importance. Our good friend ought to define his meaning clearly, and—”

A loud knock, which announced the arrival of the des Grassins family, succeeded by their entrance and salutations, hindered Cruchot from concluding his sentence. The notary was glad of the interruption, for Grandet was beginning to look suspiciously at him, and the wen gave signs of a brewing storm. In the first place, the notary did not think it becoming in a president of the Civil courts to go to Paris and manipulate creditors and lend himself to an underhand job which clashed with the laws of strict integrity;moreover, never having known old Grandet to express the slightest desire to pay anything, no matter what, he instinctively feared to see his nephew taking part in the affair. He therefore profited by the entrance of the des Grassins to take the nephew by the arm and lead him into the embrasure of the window—

“You have said enough, nephew; you’ve shown enough devotion. Your desire to win the girl blinds you. The devil! you mustn’t go at it tooth and nail. Let me sail the ship now; you can haul on the braces. Do you think it right to compromise your dignity as a magistrate in such a—”

He stopped, for he heard Monsieur des Grassins saying to the old cooper as they shook hands—

“Grandet, we have heard of the frightful misfortunes which have just befallen your family—the failure of the house of Guillaume Grandet and the death of your brother. We have come to express our grief at these sad events.”

“There is but one sad event,” said the notary, interrupting the banker—”the death of Monsieur Grandet, junior; and he would never have killed himself had he thought in time of applying to his brother for help. Our old friend, who is honorable to his finger-nails, intends to liquidate the debts of the Maison Grandet of Paris. To save him the worry of legal proceedings, my nephew, the president, has just offered to go to Paris and negotiate with the creditors for a satisfactory settlement.”

These words, corroborated by Grandet’s attitude as he stood silently nursing his chin, astonished the three des Grassins, who had been leisurely discussing the old man’s avarice as they came along, very nearly accusing him of fratricide.

“Ah! I was sure of it,” cried the banker, looking at his wife.“What did I tell you just now, Madame des Grassins? Grandet is honorable to the backbone, and would never allow his name to remain under the slightest cloud! Money without honor is a disease. There is honor in the provinces! Right, very right, Grandet. I’m an old soldier, and I can’t disguise my thoughts; I speak roughly. Thunder! it is sublime!”

“Th…then s…s…sublime th…things c…c…cost d…dear,”answered the goodman, as the banker warmly wrung his hand.

“But this, my dear Grandet—if the president will excuse me—is a purely commercial matter, and needs a consummate business man. Your agent must be some one fully acquainted with the markets—with disbursements, rebates, interest calculations, and so forth. I am going to Paris on business of my own, and I can take charge of—”

“We’ll see about t…t…trying to m…m…manage it b…b…between us, under the p…p…peculiar c…c…circumstances, b…b…but without b…b…binding m…m…myself to anything th…that I c…c…could not do,” said Grandet, stuttering; “because, you see, monsieur le president naturally expects me to pay the expenses of his journey.” The goodman did not stammer over the last words.

“Eh!” cried Madame des Grassins, “Why it is a pleasure to go to Paris. I would willingly pay to go myself.”

She made a sign to her husband, as if to encourage him in cutting the enemy out of the commission, coute que coute; then she glanced ironically at the two Cruchots, who looked chap…fallen.

Grandet seized the banker by a button and drew him into a corner of the room.

“I have a great deal more confidence in you than in the president,” he said; “besides, I’ve other fish to fry,” he added, wriggling his wen. “I want to buy a few thousand francs in the Funds while they are at eighty. They fall, I’m told, at the end of each month. You know all about these things, don’t you?”

“Bless me! Then, am I to invest enough to give you a few thousand francs a year?”

“That’s not much to begin with. Hush! I don’t want any one to know I am going to play that game. You can make the investment by the end of the month. Say nothing to the Cruchots; that’ll annoy them. If you are really going to Paris, we will see if there is anything to be done for my poor nephew.”

“Well, it’s all settled. I’ll start to…morrow by the mail…post,” said des Grassins aloud, “and I will come and take your last directions at—what hour will suit you?”

“Five o’clock, just before dinner,” said Grandet, rubbing his hands.

The two parties stayed on for a short time. Des Grassins said, after a pause, striking Grandet on the shoulder—

“It is a good thing to have a relation like him.”

“Yes, yes; without making a show,” said Grandet, “I am a g…good relation. I loved my brother, and I will prove it, unless it c…c…costs—”

“We must leave you, Grandet,” said the banker, interrupting him fortunately before he got to the end of his sentence. “If I hurry my departure, I must attend to some matters at once.”

“Very good, very good! I myself—in c…consequence of what I t…told you—I must retire to my own room and ‘d…d…deliberate,’ as President Cruchot says.”

“Plague take him! I am no longer Monsieur de Bonfons,”thought the magistrate ruefully, his face assuming the expression of a judge bored by an argument.

The heads of the two factions walked off together. Neither gave any further thought to the treachery Grandet had been guilty of in the morning against the whole wine-growing community; each tried to fathom what the other was thinking about the real intentions of the wily old man in this new affair, but in vain.

“Will you go with us to Madame Dorsonval’s?” said des Grassins to the notary.

“We will go there later,” answered the president. “I have promised to say good-evening to Mademoiselle de Gribeaucourt, and we will go there first, if my uncle is willing.”

“Farewell for the present!” said Madame des Grassins.

When the Cruchots were a few steps off, Adolphe remarked to his father—

“Are not they fuming, hein?”

“Hold your tongue, my son!” said his mother; “They might hear you. Besides, what you say is not in good taste—law-school language.”

“Well, uncle,” cried the president when he saw the des Grassins disappearing, “I began by being de Bonfons, and I have ended as nothing but Cruchot.”

“I saw that that annoyed you; but the wind has set fair for the des Grassins. What a fool you are, with all your cleverness! Let them sail off on Grandet’s ‘We’ll see about it,’ and keep yourself quiet,young man. Eugenie will none the less be your wife.”

In a few moments the news of Grandet’s magnanimous resolve was disseminated in three houses at the same moment, and the whole town began to talk of his fraternal devotion. Every one forgave Grandet for the sale made in defiance of the good faith pledged to the community; they admired his sense of honor, and began to laud a generosity of which they had never thought him capable. It is part of the French nature to grow enthusiastic, or angry, or fervent about some meteor of the moment. Can it be that collective beings, nationalities, peoples, are devoid of memory?

When Pere Grandet had shut the door he called Nanon.

“Don’t let the dog loose, and don’t go to bed; we have work to do together. At eleven o’clock Cornoiller will be at the door with the chariot from Froidfond. Listen for him and prevent his knocking;tell him to come in softly. Police regulations don’t allow nocturnal racket. Besides, the whole neighborhood need not know that I am starting on a journey.”

So saying, Grandet returned to his private room, where Nanon heard him moving about, rummaging, and walking to and fro, though with much precaution, for he evidently did not wish to wake his wife and daughter, and above all not to rouse the attention of his nephew, whom he had begun to anathematize when he saw a thread of light under his door.

About the middle of the night Eugenie, intent on her cousin, fancied she heard a cry like that of a dying person. It must be Charles, she thought; he was so pale, so full of despair when she had seen him last—could he have killed himself? She wrapped herself quickly in a loose garment—a sort of pelisse with a hood—and was about to leave the room when a bright light coming through the chinks of her door made her think of fire. But she recovered herself as she heard Nanon’s heavy steps and gruff voice mingling with the snorting of several horses. “Can my father be carrying off my cousin?” she said to herself, opening her door with great precaution lest it should creak, and yet enough to let her see into the corridor.

Suddenly her eye encountered that of her father; and his glance, vague and unnoticing as it was, terrified her. The goodman and Nanon were yoked together by a stout stick, each end of which rested on their shoulders; a stout rope was passed over it, on which was slung a small barrel or keg like those Pere Grandet still made in his bakehouse as an amusement for his leisure hours.

“Holy Virgin, how heavy it is!” said the voice of Nanon.

“What a pity that it is only copper sous!” answered Grandet.“Take care you don’t knock over the candlestick.”

The scene was lighted by a single candle placed between two rails of the staircase.

“Cornoiller,” said Grandet to his keeper in partibus, “have you brought your pistols?”

“No, monsieur. Mercy! what’s there to fear for your copper sous?”

“Oh! nothing,” said Pere Grandet.

“Besides, we shall go fast,” added the man; “your farmers have picked out their best horses.”

“Very good. You did not tell them where I was going?”

“I didn’t know where.”

“Very good. Is the carriage strong?”

“Strong? hear to that, now! Why, it can carry three thousand weight. How much does that old keg weigh?”

“Goodness!” exclaimed Nanon. “I ought to know! There’s pretty nigh eighteen hundred—”

“Will you hold your tongue, Nanon! You are to tell my wife I have gone into the country. I shall be back to dinner. Drive fast, Cornoiller; I must get to Angers before nine o’clock.”

The carriage drove off. Nanon bolted the great door, let loose the dog, and went off to bed with a bruised shoulder, no one in the neighborhood suspecting either the departure of Grandet or the object of his journey. The precautions of the old miser and his reticence were never relaxed. No one had ever seen a penny in that house, filled as it was with gold. Hearing in the morning, through the gossip of the port, that exchange on gold had doubled in price in consequence of certain military preparations undertaken at Nantes, and that speculators had arrived at Angers to buy coin, the old wine-grower, by the simple process of borrowing horses from his farmers, seized the chance of selling his gold and of bringing back in the form of treasury notes the sum he intended to put into the Funds, having swelled it considerably by the exchange.

“My father has gone,” thought Eugenie, who heard all that took place from the head of the stairs.

Silence was restored in the house, and the distant rumbling of the carriage, ceasing by degrees, no longer echoed through the sleeping town. At this moment Eugenie heard in her heart, before the sound caught her ears, a cry which pierced the partitions and came from her cousin’s chamber. A line of light, thin as the blade of a sabre, shone through a chink in the door and fell horizontally on the balusters of the rotten staircase.

“He suffers!” she said, springing up the stairs.

A second moan brought her to the landing near his room. The door was ajar, she pushed it open. Charles was sleeping; his head hung over the side of the old armchair, and his hand, from which the pen had fallen, nearly touched the floor. The oppressed breathing caused by the strained posture suddenly frightened Eugenie, who entered the room hastily.

“He must be very tired,” she said to herself, glancing at a dozen letters lying sealed upon the table. She read their addresses: “To Messrs. Farry, Breilmann, & Co., carriage-makers”; “To Monsieur Buisson, tailor,” etc.

“He has been settling all his affairs, so as to leave France at once,” she thought.

Her eyes fell upon two open letters. The words, “My dear Annette,” at the head of one of them, blinded her for a moment. Her heart beat fast, her feet were nailed to the floor.

“His dear Annette! He loves! he is loved! No hope! What does he say to her?”

These thoughts rushed through her head and heart. She saw the words everywhere, even on the bricks of the floor, in letters of fire.

“Resign him already? No, no! I will not read the letter. I ought to go away—What if I do read it?”

She looked at Charles, then she gently took his head and placed it against the back of the chair; he let her do so, like a child which, though asleep, knows its mother’s touch and receives, without awaking, her kisses and watchful care. Like a mother Eugenie raised the drooping hand, and like a mother she gently kissed the chestnut hair—“Dear Annette!” a demon shrieked the words in her ear.

“I am doing wrong; but I must read it, that letter,” she said.

She turned away her head, for her noble sense of honor reproached her. For the first time in her life good and evil struggled together in her heart. Up to that moment she had never had to blush for any action. Passion and curiosity triumphed. As she read each sentence her heart swelled more and more, and the keen glow which filled her being as she did so, only made the joys of first love still more precious.

My dear Annette—Nothing could ever have separated us but the great misfortune which has now overwhelmed me, and which no human foresight could have prevented. My father has killed himself; his fortune and mine are irretrievably lost. I am orphaned at an age when, through the nature of my education, I am still a child; and yet I must lift myself as a man out of the abyss into which I am plunged. I have just spent half the night in facing my position. If I wish to leave France an honest man—and there is no doubt of that—I have not a hundred francs of my own with which to try my fate in the Indies or in America. Yes, my poor Anna, I must seek my fortune in those deadly climates. Under those skies, they tell me, I am sure to make it. As for remaining in Paris, I cannot do so. Neither my nature nor my face are made to bear the affronts, the neglect, the disdain shown to a ruined man, the son of a bankrupt! Good God! think of owing two millions! I should be killed in a duel the first week;therefore I shall not return there. Your love—the most tender and devoted love which ever ennobled the heart of man—cannot draw me back. Alas! my beloved, I have no money with which to go to you, to give and receive a last kiss from which I might derive some strength for my forlorn

enterprise.

“Poor Charles! I did well to read the letter. I have gold; I will give it to him,” thought Eugenie.

She wiped her eyes, and went on reading.

I have never thought of the miseries of poverty. If I have the hundred louis required for the mere costs of the journey, I have not a sou for an outfit. But no, I have not the hundred louis, not even one louis. I don’t know that anything will be left after I have paid my debts in Paris. If I have nothing, I shall go quietly to Nantes and ship as a common sailor; and I will begin in the new world like other men who have started young without a sou and brought back the wealth of the Indies. During this long day I have faced my future coolly. It seems more horrible for me than for another, because I have been so petted by a mother who adored me, so indulged by the kindest of fathers, so blessed by meeting, on my entrance into life, with the love of an Anna! The flowers of life are all I have ever known. Such happiness could not last. Nevertheless, my dear Annette, I feel more courage than a careless young man is supposed to feel—above all a young man used to the caressing ways of the dearest woman in all Paris, cradled in family joys, on whom all things smiled in his home, whose wishes were a law to his father—oh, my father! Annette, he is dead!

Well, I have thought over my position, and yours as well. I have grown old in twenty-four hours. Dear Anna, if in order to keep me with you in Paris you were to sacrifice your luxury, your dress, your opera-box, we should even then not have enough for the expenses of my extravagant ways of living. Besides, I would never accept such sacrifices. No, we must part now and forever—

“He gives her up! Blessed Virgin! What happiness!”

Eugenie quivered with joy. Charles made a movement, and a chill of terror ran through her. Fortunately, he did not wake, and she resumed her reading.

When shall I return? I do not know. The climate of the West Indies ages a European, so they say; especially a European who works hard. Let us think what may happen ten years hence. In ten years, your daughter will be eighteen; she will be your companion, your spy. To you society will be cruel, and your daughter perhaps more cruel still. We have seen cases of the harsh social judgment and ingratitude of daughters; let us take warning by them. Keep in the depths of your soul, as I shall in mine, the memory of four years of happiness, and be faithful, if you can, to the memory of your poor friend. I cannot exact such faithfulness, because, do you see, dear Annette, I must conform to the exigencies of my new life; I must take a commonplace view of them and do the best I can.Therefore I must think of marriage, which becomes one of the necessities of my future existence; and I will admit to you that I have found, here in Saumur, in my uncle’s house, a cousin whose face, manners, mind, and heart would please you, and who, besides, seems to me—

“He must have been very weary to have ceased writing to her,”thought Eugenie, as she gazed at the letter which stopped abruptly in the middle of the last sentence.

Already she defended him. How was it possible that an innocent girl should perceive the cold-heartedness evinced by this letter? To young girls religiously brought up, whose minds are ignorant and pure, all is love from the moment they set their feet within the enchanted regions of that passion. They walk there bathed in a celestial light shed from their own souls, which reflects its rays upon their lover; they color all with the flame of their own emotion and attribute to him their highest thoughts. A woman’s errors come almost always from her belief in good or her confidence in truth. In Eugenie’s simple heart the words, “My dear Annette, my loved one,”echoed like the sweetest language of love; they caressed her soul as, in childhood, the divine notes of the Venite adoremus, repeated by the organ, caressed her ear. Moreover, the tears which still lingered on the young man’s lashes gave signs of that nobility of heart by which young girls are rightly won.

How could she know that Charles, though he loved his father and mourned him truly, was moved far more by paternal goodness than by the goodness of his own heart? Monsieur and Madame Guillaume Grandet, by gratifying every fancy of their son, and lavishing upon him the pleasures of a large fortune, had kept him from making the horrible calculations of which so many sons in Paris become more or less guilty when, face to face with the enjoyments of the world, they form desires and conceive schemes which they see with bitterness must be put off or laid aside during the lifetime of their parents. The liberality of the father in this instance had shed into the heart of the son a real love, in which there was no afterthought of self-interest. Nevertheless, Charles was a true child of Paris, taught by the customs of society and by Annette herself to calculate everything; already an old man under the mask of youth. He had gone through the frightful education of social life, of that world where in one evening more crimes are committed in thought and speech than justice ever punishes at the assizes; where jests and clever sayings assassinate the noblest ideas; where no one is counted strong unless his mind sees clear: and to see clear in that world is to believe in nothing, neither in feelings, nor in men, nor even in events—for events are falsified. There, to “see clear”we must weigh a friend’s purse daily, learn how to keep ourselves adroitly on the top of the wave, cautiously admire nothing, neither works of art nor glorious actions, and remember that self-interest is the mainspring of all things here below. After committing many follies, the great lady—the beautiful Annette—compelled Charles to think seriously; with her perfumed hand among his curls, she talked to him of his future position; as she rearranged his locks, she taught him lessons of worldly prudence; she made him effeminate and materialized him—a double corruption, but a delicate and elegant corruption, in the best taste.

“You are very foolish, Charles,” she would say to him. “I shall have a great deal of trouble in teaching you to understand the world. You behaved extremely ill to Monsieur des Lupeaulx. I know very well he is not an honorable man; but wait till he is no longer in power, then you may despise him as much as you like. Do you know what Madame Campan used to tell us?—‘My dears, as long as a man is a minister, adore him; when he falls, help to drag him in the gutter. Powerful, he is a sort of god; fallen, he is lower than Marat in the sewer, because he is living, and Marat is dead. Life is a series of combinations, and you must study them and understand them if you want to keep yourselves always in good position.’”

Charles was too much a man of the world, his parents had made him too happy, he had received too much adulation in society, to be possessed of noble sentiments. The grain of gold dropped by his mother into his heart was beaten thin in the smithy of Parisian society; he had spread it superficially, and it was worn away by the friction of life. Charles was only twenty-one years old. At that age the freshness of youth seems inseparable from candor and sincerity of soul. The voice, the glance, the face itself, seem in harmony with the feelings; and thus it happens that the sternest judge, the most sceptical lawyer, the least complying of usurers, always hesitate to admit decrepitude of heart or the corruption of worldly calculation while the eyes are still bathed in purity and no wrinkles seam the brow. Charles, so far, had had no occasion to apply the maxims of Parisian morality; up to this time he was still endowed with the beauty of inexperience. And yet, unknown to himself, he had been inoculated with selfishness. The germs of Parisian political economy, latent in his heart, would assuredly burst forth, sooner or later, whenever the careless spectator became an actor in the drama of real life.

Nearly all young girls succumb to the tender promises such an outward appearance seems to offer: even if Eugenie had been as prudent and observing as provincial girls are often found to be, she was not likely to distrust her cousin when his manners, words, and actions were still in unison with the aspirations of a youthful heart. A mere chance—a fatal chance—threw in her way the last effusions of real feeling which stirred the young man’s soul; she heard as it were the last breathings of his conscience.

She laid down the letter—to her so full of love—and began smilingly to watch her sleeping cousin; the fresh illusions of life were still, for her at least, upon his face; she vowed to herself to love him always. Then she cast her eyes on the other letter, without attaching much importance to this second indiscretion; and though she read it, it was only to obtain new proofs of the noble qualities which, like all women, she attributed to the man her heart had chosen.

My dear Alphonse—When you receive this letter I shall be without friends; but let me assure you that while I doubt the friendship of the world, I have never doubted yours. I beg you therefore to settle all my affairs, and I trust to you to get as much as you can out of my possessions. By this time you know my situation. I have nothing left, and I intend to go at once to the Indies. I have just written to all the people to whom I think I owe money, and you will find enclosed a list of their names, as correct as I can make it from memory. My books, my furniture, my pictures, my horses, etc., ought, I think, to pay my debts. I do not wish to keep anything, except, perhaps, a few baubles which might serve as the beginning of an outfit for my enterprise. My dear Alphonse, I will send you a proper power of attorney under which you can make these sales. Send me all my weapons. Keep Briton for yourself; nobody would pay the value of that noble beast, and I would rather give him to you—like a mourning-ring bequeathed by a dying man to his executor. Farry, Breilmann, & Co. built me a very comfortable travelling-carriage, which they have not yet delivered; persuade them to keep it and not ask for any payment on it. If they refuse, do what you can in the matter, and avoid everything that might seem dishonorable in me under my present circumstances. I owe the British Islander six louis, which I lost at cards; don’t fail to pay him—

“Dear cousin!” whispered Eugenie, throwing down the letter and running softly back to her room, carrying one of the lighted candles.

A thrill of pleasure passed over her as she opened the drawer of an old oak cabinet, a fine specimen of the period called the Renaissance, on which could still be seen, partly effaced, the famous royal salamander. She took from the drawer a large purse of red velvet with gold tassels, edged with a tarnished fringe of gold wire—a relic inherited from her grandmother. She weighed it proudly in her hand, and began with delight to count over the forgotten items of her little hoard.

First she took out twenty portugaises, still new, struck in the reign of John V., 1725, worth by exchange, as her father told her, five lisbonnines, or a hundred and sixty-eight francs, sixty-four centimes each; their conventional value, however, was a hundred and eighty francs apiece, on account of the rarity and beauty of the coins, which shone like little suns.

Item, five genovines, or five hundred-franc pieces of Genoa;another very rare coin worth eighty-seven francs on exchange, but a hundred francs to collectors. These had formerly belonged to old Monsieur de la Bertelliere.

Item, three gold quadruples, Spanish, of Philip V., struck in 1729, given to her one by one by Madame Gentillet, who never failed to say, using the same words, when she made the gift, “This dear little canary, this little yellow-boy, is worth ninety-eight francs! Keep it, my pretty one, it will be the flower of your treasure.”

Item (that which her father valued most of all, the gold of these coins being twenty-three carats and a fraction), a hundred Dutch ducats, made in the year 1756, and worth thirteen francs apiece.

Item, a great curiosity, a species of medal precious to the soul of misers—three rupees with the sign of the Scales, and five rupees with the sign of the Virgin, all in pure gold of twenty-four carats; the magnificent money of the Great Mogul, each of which was worth by mere weight thirty-seven francs, forty centimes, but at least fifty francs to those connoisseurs who love to handle gold.

Item, the napoleon of forty francs received the day before, which she had forgotten to put away in the velvet purse.

This treasure was all in virgin coins, true works of art, which Grandet from time to time inquired after and asked to see, pointing out to his daughter their intrinsic merits—such as the beauty of the milled edge, the clearness of the flat surface, the richness of the lettering, whose angles were not yet rubbed off.

Eugenie gave no thought to these rarities, nor to her father’s mania for them, nor to the danger she incurred in depriving herself of a treasure so dear to him; no, she thought only of her cousin, and soon made out, after a few mistakes of calculation, that she possessed about five thousand eight hundred francs in actual value, which might be sold for their additional value to collectors for nearly six thousand. She looked at her wealth and clapped her hands like a happy child forced to spend its overflowing joy in artless movements of the body. Father and daughter had each counted up their fortune this night—he, to sell his gold; Eugenie to fling hers into the ocean of affection.

She put the pieces back into the old purse, took it in her hand, and ran upstairs without hesitation. The secret misery of her cousin made her forget the hour and conventional propriety; she was strong in her conscience, in her devotion, in her happiness.

As she stood upon the threshold of the door, holding the candle in one hand and the purse in the other, Charles woke, caught sight of her, and remained speechless with surprise. Eugenie came forward, put the candle on the table, and said in a quivering voice:

“My cousin, I must beg pardon for a wrong I have done you;but God will pardon me—if you—will help me to wipe it out.”

“What is it?” asked Charles, rubbing his eyes.

“I have read those letters.”

Charles colored.

“How did it happen?” she continued; “how came I here? Truly, I do not know. I am tempted not to regret too much that I have read them; they have made me know your heart, your soul, and—”

“And what?” asked Charles.

“Your plans, your need of a sum—”

“My dear cousin—”

“Hush, hush! My cousin, not so loud; we must not wake others. See,” she said, opening her purse, “here are the savings of a poor girl who wants nothing. Charles, accept them! This morning I was ignorant of the value of money; you have taught it to me. It is but a means, after all. A cousin is almost a brother; you can surely borrow the purse of your sister.”

Eugenie, as much a woman as a young girl, never dreamed of refusal; but her cousin remained silent.

“Oh! You will not refuse?” cried Eugenie, the beatings of whose heart could be heard in the deep silence.

Her cousin’s hesitation mortified her; but the sore need of his position came clearer still to her mind, and she knelt down.

“I will never rise till you have taken that gold!” she said. “My cousin, I implore you, answer me! let me know if you respect me, if you are generous, if—”

As he heard this cry of noble distress the young man’s tears fell upon his cousin’s hands, which he had caught in his own to keep her from kneeling. As the warm tears touched her, Eugenie sprang to the purse and poured its contents upon the table.

“Ah! yes, yes, you consent?” she said, weeping with joy.“Fear nothing, my cousin, you will be rich. This gold will bring you happiness; some day you shall bring it back to me—are we not partners? I will obey all conditions. But you should not attach such value to the gift.”

Charles was at last able to express his feelings. “Yes, Eugenie;my soul would be small indeed if I did not accept. And yet—gift for gift, confidence for confidence.”

“What do you mean?” she said, frightened.

“Listen, dear cousin; I have here—”

He interrupted himself to point out a square box covered with an outer case of leather which was on the drawers.

“There,” he continued, “is something as precious to me as life itself. This box was a present from my mother. All day I have been thinking that if she could rise from her grave, she would herself sell the gold which her love for me lavished on this dressing-case; but were I to do so, the act would seem to me a sacrilege.”

Eugenie pressed his hand as she heard these last words.

“No,” he added, after a slight pause, during which a liquid glance of tenderness passed between them, “no, I will neither sell it nor risk its safety on my journey. Dear Eugenie, you shall be its guardian. Never did friend commit anything more sacred to another. Let me show it to you.”

He went to the box, took it from its outer coverings, opened it, and showed his delighted cousin a dressing-case where the rich workmanship gave to the gold ornaments a value far above their weight.

“What you admire there is nothing,” he said, pushing a secret spring which opened a hidden drawer. “Here is something which to me is worth the whole world.”

He drew out two portraits, masterpieces of Madame Mirbel, richly set with pearls.

“Oh, how beautiful! Is it the lady to whom you wrote that—”

“No,” he said, smiling; “this is my mother, and here is my father, your aunt and uncle. Eugenie, I beg you on my knees, keep my treasure safely. If I die and your little fortune is lost, this gold and these pearls will repay you. To you alone could I leave these portraits; you are worthy to keep them. But destroy them at last, so that they may pass into no other hands.”

Eugenie was silent.

“Ah, yes, say yes! You consent?” he added with winning grace.

Hearing the very words she had just used to her cousin now addressed to herself, she turned upon him a look of love, her first look of loving womanhood—a glance in which there is nearly as much of coquetry as of inmost depth. He took her hand and kissed it.

“Angel of purity! between us two money is nothing, never can be anything. Feeling, sentiment, must be all henceforth.”

“You are like your mother—was her voice as soft as yours?”

“Oh! much softer—”

“Yes, for you,” she said, dropping her eyelids. “Come, Charles, go to bed; I wish it; you must be tired. Good-night.”

She gently disengaged her hand from those of her cousin, who followed her to her room, lighting the way. When they were both upon the threshold—

“Ah!” he said, “why am I ruined?”

“What matter?—my father is rich; I think so,” she answered.

“Poor child!” said Charles, making a step into her room and leaning his back against the wall, “If that were so, he would never have let my father die; he would not let you live in this poor way; he would live otherwise himself.”

“But he owns Froidfond.”

“What is Froidfond worth?”

“I don’t know; but he has Noyers.”

“Nothing but a poor farm!”

“He has vineyards and fields.”

“Mere nothing,” said Charles disdainfully. “If your father had only twenty-four thousand francs a year do you suppose you would live in this cold, barren room?” he added, making a step in advance.“Ah! there you will keep my treasures,” he said, glancing at the old cabinet, as if to hide his thoughts.

“Go and sleep,” she said, hindering his entrance into the disordered room.

Charles stepped back, and they bid each other good-night with a mutual smile.

Both fell asleep in the same dream; and from that moment the youth began to wear roses with his mourning.

The next day, before breakfast, Madame Grandet found her daughter in the garden in company with Charles. The young man was still sad, as became a poor fellow who, plunged in misfortune, measures the depths of the abyss into which he has fallen, and sees the terrible burden of his whole future life.

“My father will not be home till dinner-time,” said Eugenie, perceiving the anxious look on her mother’s face.

It was easy to trace in the face and manners of the young girl and in the singular sweetness of her voice a unison of thought between her and her cousin. Their souls had espoused each other, perhaps before they even felt the force of the feelings which bound them together. Charles spent the morning in the hall, and his sadness was respected. Each of the three women had occupations of her own. Grandet had left all his affairs unattended to, and a number of persons came on business—the plumber, the mason, the slater, the carpenter, the diggers, the dressers, the farmers; some to drive a bargain about repairs, others to pay their rent or to be paid themselves for services. Madame Grandet and Eugenie were obliged to go and come and listen to the interminable talk of all these workmen and country folk. Nanon put away in her kitchen the produce which they brought as tribute. She always waited for her master’s orders before she knew what portion was to be used in the house and what was to be sold in the market. It was the goodman’s custom, like that of a great many country gentlemen, to drink his bad wine and eat his spoiled fruit.

Towards five in the afternoon Grandet returned from Angers, having made fourteen thousand francs by the exchange on his gold, bringing home in his wallet good treasury-notes which bore interest until the day he should invest them in the Funds. He had left Cornoiller at Angers to look after the horses, which were well-nigh foundered, with orders to bring them home slowly after they were rested.

“I have got back from Angers, wife,” he said; “I am hungry.”

Nanon called out to him from the kitchen: “Haven’t you eaten anything since yesterday?”

“Nothing,” answered the old man.

Nanon brought in the soup. Des Grassins came to take his client’s orders just as the family sat down to dinner. Grandet had not even observed his nephew.

“Go on eating, Grandet,” said the banker; “we can talk. Do you know what gold is worth in Angers? They have come from Nantes after it? I shall send some of ours.”

“Don’t send any,” said Grandet; “they have got enough. We are such old friends, I ought to save you from such a loss of time.”

“But gold is worth thirteen francs fifty centimes.”

“Say was worth—”

“Where the devil have they got any?”

“I went to Angers last night,” answered Grandet in a low voice.

The banker shook with surprise. Then a whispered conversation began between the two, during which Grandet and des Grassins frequently looked at Charles. Presently des Grassins gave a start of astonishment; probably Grandet was then instructing him to invest the sum which was to give him a hundred thousand francs a year in the Funds.

“Monsieur Grandet,” said the banker to Charles, “I am starting for Paris; if you have any commissions—”

“None, monsieur, I thank you,” answered Charles.

“Thank him better than that, nephew. Monsieur is going to settle the affairs of the house of Guillaume Grandet.”

“Is there any hope?” said Charles eagerly.

“What!” exclaimed his uncle, with well-acted pride, “are you not my nephew? Your honor is ours. Is not your name Grandet?”

Charles rose, seized Pere Grandet, kissed him, turned pale, and left the room. Eugenie looked at her father with admiration.

“Well, good-bye, des Grassins; it is all in your hands. Decoy those people as best you can; lead ‘em by the nose.”

The two diplomatists shook hands. The old cooper accompanied the banker to the front door. Then, after closing it, he came back and plunged into his armchair, saying to Nanon—

“Get me some black-currant ratafia.”

Too excited, however, to remain long in one place, he got up, looked at the portrait of Monsieur de la Bertelliere, and began to sing, doing what Nanon called his dancing steps—

“Dans les gardes francaises

J’avais un bon papa.”

Nanon, Madame Grandet, and Eugenie looked at each other in silence. The hilarity of the master always frightened them when it reached its climax.

The evening was soon over. Pere Grandet chose to go to bed early, and when he went to bed, everybody else was expected to go too; like as when Augustus drank, Poland was drunk. On this occasion Nanon, Charles, and Eugenie were not less tired than the master. As for Madame Grandet, she slept, ate, drank, and walked according to the will of her husband. However, during the two hours consecrated to digestion, the cooper, more facetious than he had ever been in his life, uttered a number of his own particular apothegms—a single one of which will give the measure of his mind. When he had drunk his ratafia, he looked at his glass and said—

“You have no sooner put your lips to a glass than it is empty! Such is life. You can’t have and hold. Gold won’t circulate and stay in your purse. If it were not for that, life would be too fine.”

He was jovial and benevolent. When Nanon came with her spinning-wheel, “You must be tired,” he said; “put away your hemp.”

“Ah, bah! then I shall get sleepy,” she answered.

“Poor Nanon! Will you have some ratafia?”

“I won’t refuse a good offer; madame makes it a deal better than the apothecaries. What they sell is all drugs.”

“They put too much sugar,” said the master; “you can’t taste anything else.”

The following day the family, meeting at eight o’clock for the early breakfast, made a picture of genuine domestic intimacy. Grief had drawn Madame Grandet, Eugenie, and Charles en rapport; even Nanon sympathized, without knowing why. The four now made one family. As to the old man, his satisfied avarice and the certainty of soon getting rid of the dandy without having to pay more than his journey to Nantes, made him nearly indifferent to his presence in the house.

He left the two children, as he called Charles and Eugenie, free to conduct themselves as they pleased, under the eye of Madame Grandet, in whom he had implicit confidence as to all that concerned public and religious morality. He busied himself in straightening the boundaries of his fields and ditches along the high-road, in his poplar-plantations beside the Loire, in the winter work of his vineyards, and at Froidfond. All these things occupied his whole time. For Eugenie the springtime of love had come. Since the scene at night when she gave her little treasure to her cousin, her heart had followed the treasure. Confederates in the same secret, they looked at each other with a mutual intelligence which sank to the depth of their consciousness, giving a closer communion, a more intimate relation to their feelings, and putting them, so to speak, beyond the pale of ordinary life. Did not their near relationship warrant the gentleness in their tones, the tenderness in their glances? Eugenie took delight in lulling her cousin’s pain with the pretty childish joys of a new-born love.

Are there no sweet similitudes between the birth of love and the birth of life? Do we not rock the babe with gentle songs and softest glances? Do we not tell it marvellous tales of the golden future? Hope herself, does she not spread her radiant wings above its head? Does it not shed, with infant fickleness, its tears of sorrow and its tears of joy? Does it not fret for trifles, cry for the pretty pebbles with which to build its shifting palaces, for the flowers forgotten as soon as plucked? Is it not eager to grasp the coming time, to spring forward into life? Love is our second transformation. Childhood and love were one and the same thing to Eugenie and to Charles; it was a first passion, with all its child-like play—the more caressing to their hearts because they now were wrapped in sadness.

Struggling at birth against the gloom of mourning, their love was only the more in harmony with the provincial plainness of that gray and ruined house. As they exchanged a few words beside the well in the silent court, or lingered in the garden for the sunset hour, sitting on a mossy seat saying to each other the infinite nothings of love, or mused in the silent calm which reigned between the house and the ramparts like that beneath the arches of a church, Charles comprehended the sanctity of love; for his great lady, his dear Annette, had taught him only its stormy troubles. At this moment he left the worldly passion, coquettish, vain, and showy as it was, and turned to the true, pure love. He loved even the house, whose customs no longer seemed to him ridiculous.

He got up early in the mornings that he might talk with Eugenie for a moment before her father came to dole out the provisions;when the steps of the old man sounded on the staircase he escaped into the garden. The small criminality of this morningtete-a-tete which Nanon pretended not to see, gave to their innocent love the lively charm of a forbidden joy. After breakfast, when Grandet had gone to his fields and his other occupations, Charles remained with the mother and daughter, finding an unknown pleasure in holding their skeins, in watching them at work, in listening to their quiet prattle. The simplicity of this half-monastic life, which revealed to him the beauty of these souls, unknown and unknowing of the world, touched him keenly. He had believed such morals impossible in France, and admitted their existence nowhere but in Germany;even so, they seemed to him fabulous, only real in the novels of Auguste Lafontaine. Soon Eugenie became to him the Margaret of Goethe—before her fall.

Day by day his words, his looks enraptured the poor girl, who yielded herself up with delicious non-resistance to the current of love; she caught her happiness as a swimmer seizes the overhanging branch of a willow to draw himself from the river and lie at rest upon its shore. Did no dread of a coming absence sadden the happy hours of those fleeting days? Daily some little circumstance reminded them of the parting that was at hand. Three days after the departure of des Grassins, Grandet took his nephew to the Civil courts, with the solemnity which country people attach to all legal acts, that he might sign a deed surrendering his rights in his father’s estate. Terrible renunciation! species of domestic apostasy! Charles also went before Maitre Cruchot to make two powers of attorney—one for des Grassins, the other for the friend whom he had charged with the sale of his belongings. After that he attended to all the formalities necessary to obtain a passport for foreign countries; and finally, when he received his simple mourning clothes from Paris, he sent for the tailor of Saumur and sold to him his useless wardrobe. This last act pleased Grandet exceedingly.

“Ah! Now you look like a man prepared to embark and make your fortune,” he said, when Charles appeared in a surtout of plain black cloth. “Good! Very good!”

“I hope you will believe, monsieur,” answered his nephew, “that I shall always try to conform to my situation.”

“What’s that?” said his uncle, his eyes lighting up at a handful of gold which Charles was carrying.

“Monsieur, I have collected all my buttons and rings and other superfluities which may have some value; but not knowing any one in Saumur, I wanted to ask you to—”

“To buy them?” said Grandet, interrupting him.

“No, uncle; only to tell me of an honest man who—”

“Give me those things, I will go upstairs and estimate their value; I will come back and tell you what it is to a fraction.Jeweller’s gold,” examining a long chain, “eighteen or nineteen carats.”

The goodman held out his huge hand and received the mass of gold, which he carried away.

“Cousin,” said Grandet, “may I offer you these two buttons? They can fasten ribbons round your wrists; that sort of bracelet is much the fashion just now.”

“I accept without hesitation,” she answered, giving him an understanding look.

“Aunt, here is my mother’s thimble; I have always kept it carefully in my dressing-case,” said Charles, presenting a pretty gold thimble to Madame Grandet, who for many years had longed for one.

“I cannot thank you; no words are possible, my nephew,” said the poor mother, whose eyes filled with tears. “Night and morning in my prayers I shall add one for you, the most earnest of all—for those who travel. If I die, Eugenie will keep this treasure for you.”

“They are worth nine hundred and eighty-nine francs, seventy-five centimes,” said Grandet, opening the door. “To save you the pain of selling them, I will advance the money—in livres.”

The word livres on the littoral of the Loire signifies that crown prices of six livres are to be accepted as six francs without deduction.

“I dared not propose it to you,” answered Charles; “but it was most repugnant to me to sell my jewels to some second-hand dealer in your own town. People should wash their dirty linen at home, as Napoleon said. I thank you for your kindness.”

Grandet scratched his ear, and there was a moment’s silence.

“My dear uncle,” resumed Charles, looking at him with an uneasy air, as if he feared to wound his feelings, “my aunt and cousin have been kind enough to accept a trifling remembrance of me. Will you allow me to give you these sleeve-buttons, which are useless to me now? They will remind you of a poor fellow who, far away, will always think of those who are henceforth all his family.”

“My lad, my lad, you mustn’t rob yourself this way! Let me see, wife, what have you got?” he added, turning eagerly to her. “Ah! a gold thimble. And you, little girl? What! diamond buttons? Yes, I’ll accept your present, nephew,” he answered, shaking Charles by the hand. “But—you must let me—pay—your—yes, your passage to the Indies. Yes, I wish to pay your passage because—d’ye see, my boy?—in valuing your jewels I estimated only the weight of the gold; very likely the workmanship is worth something. So let us settle it that I am to give you fifteen hundred francs—in livres;Cruchot will lend them to me. I haven’t got a copper farthing here—unless Perrotet, who is behindhand with his rent, should pay up. By the bye, I’ll go and see him.”

He took his hat, put on his gloves, and went out.

“Then you are really going?” said Eugenie to her cousin, with a sad look, mingled with admiration.

“I must,” he said, bowing his head.

For some days past, Charles’s whole bearing, manners, and speech had become those of a man who, in spite of his profound affliction, feels the weight of immense obligations and has the strength to gather courage from misfortune. He no longer repined, he became a man. Eugenie never augured better of her cousin’s character than when she saw him come down in the plain black clothes which suited well with his pale face and sombre countenance. On that day the two women put on their own mourning, and all three assisted at a Requiem celebrated in the parish church for the soul of the late Guillaume Grandet.

At the second breakfast Charles received letters from Paris and began to read them.

“Well, cousin, are you satisfied with the management of your affairs?” said Eugenie in a low voice.

“Never ask such questions, my daughter,” said Grandet. “What the devil! Do I tell you my affairs? Why do you poke your nose into your cousin’s? Let the lad alone!”

“Oh! I haven’t any secrets,” said Charles.

“Ta, ta, ta, ta, nephew; you’ll soon find out that you must hold your tongue in business.”

When the two lovers were alone in the garden, Charles said to Eugenie, drawing her down on the old bench beneath the walnut-tree—

“I did right to trust Alphonse; he has done famously. He has managed my affairs with prudence and good faith. I now owe nothing in Paris. All my things have been sold; and he tells me that he has taken the advice of an old sea-captain and spent three thousand francs on a commercial outfit of European curiosities which will be sure to be in demand in the Indies. He has sent my trunks to Nantes, where a ship is loading for San Domingo. In five days, Eugenie, we must bid each other farewell—perhaps forever, at least for years. My outfit and ten thousand francs, which two of my friends send me, are a very small beginning. I cannot look to return for many years. My dear cousin, do not weight your life in the scales with mine; I may perish; some good marriage may be offered to you—”

“Do you love me?” she said.

“Oh, yes! indeed, yes!” he answered, with a depth of tone that revealed an equal depth of feeling.

“I shall wait, Charles—Good heavens! there is my father at his window,” she said, repulsing her cousin, who leaned forward to kiss her.

She ran quickly under the archway. Charles followed her. When she saw him, she retreated to the foot of the staircase and opened the swing-door; then, scarcely knowing where she was going, Eugenie reached the corner near Nanon’s den, in the darkest end of the passage. There Charles caught her hand and drew her to his heart. Passing his arm about her waist, he made her lean gently upon him. Eugenie no longer resisted; she received and gave the purest, the sweetest, and yet, withal, the most unreserved of kisses.

“Dear Eugenie, a cousin is better than a brother, for he can marry you,” said Charles.

“So be it!” cried Nanon, opening the door of her lair.

The two lovers, alarmed, fled into the hall, where Eugenie took up her work and Charles began to read the litanies of the Virgin in Madame Grandet’s prayer-book.

“Mercy!” cried Nanon, “Now they’re saying their prayers.”

As soon as Charles announced his immediate departure, Grandet bestirred himself to testify much interest in his nephew. He became very liberal of all that cost him nothing; took pains to find a packer; declared the man asked too much for his cases; insisted on making them himself out of old planks; got up early in the morning to fit and plane and nail together the strips, out of which he made, to his own satisfaction, some strong cases, in which he packed all Charles’s effects; he also took upon himself to send them by boat down the Loire, to insure them, and get them to Nantes in proper time.

After the kiss taken in the passage, the hours fled for Eugenie with frightful rapidity. Sometimes she thought of following her cousin. Those who have known that most endearing of all passions—the one whose duration is each day shortened by time, by age, by mortal illness, by human chances and fatalities—they will understand the poor girl’s tortures. She wept as she walked in the garden, now so narrow to her, as indeed the court, the house, the town all seemed. She launched in thought upon the wide expanse of the ocean he was about to traverse.

At last the eve of his departure came. That morning, in the absence of Grandet and of Nanon, the precious case which contained the two portraits was solemnly installed in the only drawer of the old cabinet which could be locked, where the now empty velvet purse was lying. This deposit was not made without a goodly number of tears and kisses. When Eugenie placed the key within her bosom she had no courage to forbid the kiss with which Charles sealed the act.

“It shall never leave that place, my friend,” she said.

“Then my heart will be always there.”

“Ah! Charles, it is not right,” she said, as though she blamed him.

“Are we not married?” he said. “I have thy promise—then take mine.”

“Thine; I am thine forever!” they each said, repeating the words twice over.

No promise made upon this earth was ever purer. The innocent sincerity of Eugenie had sanctified for a moment the young man’s love.

On the morrow the breakfast was sad. Nanon herself, in spite of the gold-embroidered robe and the Jeannette cross bestowed by Charles, had tears in her eyes.

“The poor dear monsieur who is going on the seas—oh, may God guide him!”

At half-past ten the whole family started to escort Charles to the diligence for Nantes. Nanon let loose the dog, locked the door, and insisted on carrying the young man’s carpet-bag. All the tradesmen in the tortuous old street were on the sill of their shop-doors to watch the procession, which was joined in the market-place by Maitre Cruchot.

“Eugenie, be sure you don’t cry,” said her mother.

“Nephew,” said Grandet, in the doorway of the inn from which the coach started, kissing Charles on both cheeks, “depart poor, return rich; you will find the honor of your father safe. I answer for that myself, I—Grandet; for it will only depend on you to—”

“Ah! My uncle, you soften the bitterness of my departure. Is it not the best gift that you could make me?”

Not understanding his uncle’s words which he had thus interrupted, Charles shed tears of gratitude upon the tanned cheeks of the old miser, while Eugenie pressed the hand of her cousin and that of her father with all her strength. The notary smiled, admiring the sly speech of the old man, which he alone had understood.

The family stood about the coach until it started; then as it disappeared upon the bridge, and its rumble grew fainter in the distance, Grandet said:

“Good-bye to you!”

Happily no one but Maitre Cruchot heard the exclamation. Eugenie and her mother had gone to a corner of the quay from which they could still see the diligence and wave their white handkerchiefs, to which Charles made answer by displaying his.

“Ah! mother, would that I had the power of God for a single moment,” said Eugenie, when she could no longer see her lover’s handkerchief.





Not to interrupt the current of events which are about to take place in the bosom of the Grandet family, it is necessary to cast a forestalling eye upon the various operations which the goodman carried on in Paris by means of Monsieur des Grassins. A month after the latter’s departure from Saumur, Grandet, became possessed of a certificate of a hundred thousand francs a year from his investment in the Funds, bought at eighty francs net. The particulars revealed at his death by the inventory of his property threw no light upon the means which his suspicious nature took to remit the price of the investment and receive the certificate thereof. Maitre Cruchot was of opinion that Nanon, unknown to herself, was the trusty instrument by which the money was transported; for about this time she was absent five days, under a pretext of putting things to rights at Froidfond—as if the goodman were capable of leaving anything lying about or out of order! In all that concerned the business of the house of Guillaume Grandet the old cooper’s intentions were fulfilled to the letter.

The Bank of France, as everybody knows, affords exact information about all the large fortunes in Paris and the provinces.The names of des Grassins and Felix Grandet of Saumur were well known there, and they enjoyed the esteem bestowed on financial celebrities whose wealth comes from immense and unencumbered territorial possessions. The arrival of the Saumur banker for the purpose, it was said, of honorably liquidating the affairs of Grandet of Paris, was enough to avert the shame of protested notes from the memory of the defunct merchant. The seals on the property were taken off in presence of the creditors, and the notary employed by Grandet went to work at once on the inventory of the assets. Soon after this, des Grassins called a meeting of the creditors, who unanimously elected him, conjointly with Francois Keller, the head of a rich banking-house and one of those principally interested in the affair, as liquidators, with full power to protect both the honor of the family and the interests of the claimants. The credit of Grandet of Saumur, the hopes he diffused by means of des Grassins in the minds of all concerned, facilitated the transactions. Not a single creditor proved recalcitrant; no one thought of passing his claim to his profit-and-loss account; each and all said confidently, “Grandet of Saumur will pay.”

Six months went by. The Parisians had redeemed the notes in circulation as they fell due, and held them under lock and key in their desks. First result aimed at by the old cooper!

Nine months after this preliminary meeting, the two liquidators distributed forty-seven per cent to each creditor on his claim. This amount was obtained by the sale of the securities, property, and possessions of all kinds belonging to the late Guillaume Grandet, and was paid over with scrupulous fidelity.

Unimpeachable integrity was shown in the transaction. The creditors gratefully acknowledged the remarkable and incontestable honor displayed by the Grandets. When these praises had circulated for a certain length of time, the creditors asked for the rest of their money. It became necessary to write a collective letter to Grandet of Saumur.

“Here it comes!” said the old man as he threw the letter into the fire. “Patience, my good friends!”

In answer to the proposals contained in the letter, Grandet of Saumur demanded that all vouchers for claims against the estate of his brother should be deposited with a notary, together with acquittances for the forty-seven per cent already paid; he made this demand under pretence of sifting the accounts and finding out the exact condition of the estate. It roused at once a variety of difficulties.

Generally speaking, the creditor is a species of maniac, ready to agree to anything one day, on the next breathing fire and slaughter;later on, he grows amicable and easy-going. To-day his wife is good-humored, his last baby has cut its first tooth, all is well at home, and he is determined not to lose a sou; on the morrow it rains, he can’t go out, he is gloomy, he says yes to any proposal that is made to him, so long as it will put an end to the affair; on the third day he declares he must have guarantees; by the end of the month he wants his debtor’s head, and becomes at heart an executioner. The creditor is a good deal like the sparrow on whose tail confiding children are invited to put salt—with this difference, that he applies the image to his claim, the proceeds of which he is never able to lay hold of.

Grandet had studied the atmospheric variations of creditors, and the creditors of his brother justified all his calculations. Some were angry, and flatly refused to give in their vouchers.

“Very good; so much the better,” said Grandet, rubbing his hands over the letter in which des Grassins announced the fact.

Others agreed to the demand, but only on condition that their rights should be fully guaranteed; they renounced none, and even reserved the power of ultimately compelling a failure. On this began a long correspondence, which ended in Grandet of Saumur agreeing to all conditions. By means of this concession the placable creditors were able to bring the dissatisfied creditors to reason. The deposit was then made, but not without sundry complaints.

“Your goodman,” they said to des Grassins, “is tricking us.”

Twenty-three months after the death of Guillaume Grandet many of the creditors, carried away by more pressing business in the markets of Paris, had forgotten their Grandet claims, or only thought of them to say: “I begin to believe that forty-seven per cent is all I shall ever get out of that affair.”

The old cooper had calculated on the power of time, which, as he used to say, is a pretty good devil after all. By the end of the third year des Grassins wrote to Grandet that he had brought the creditors to agree to give up their claims for ten per cent on the two million four hundred thousand francs still due by the house of Grandet.

Grandet answered that the notary and the broker whose shameful failures had caused the death of his brother were still living, that they might now have recovered their credit, and that they ought to be sued, so as to get something out of them towards lessening the total of the deficit.

By the end of the fourth year the liabilities were definitely estimated at a sum of twelve hundred thousand francs. Many negotiations, lasting over six months, took place between the creditors and the liquidators, and between the liquidators and Grandet. To make a long story short, Grandet of Saumur, anxious by this time to get out of the affair, told the liquidators, about the ninth month of the fourth year, that his nephew had made a fortune in the Indies and was disposed to pay his father’s debts in full; he therefore could not take upon himself to make any settlement without previously consulting him; he had written to him, and was expecting an answer.

The creditors were held in check until the middle of the fifth year by the words, “payment in full,” which the wily old miser threw out from time to time as he laughed in his beard, saying with a smile and an oath, “Those Parisians!” But the creditors were reserved for a fate unexampled in the annals of commerce. When the events of this history bring them once more into notice, they will be found still in the position Grandet had resolved to force them into from the first.

As soon as the Funds reached a hundred and fifteen, Pere Grandet sold out his interests and withdrew two million four hundred thousand francs in gold, to which he added, in his coffers, the six hundred thousand francs compound interest which he had derived from the capital. Des Grassins now lived in Paris. In the first place he had been made a deputy; then he became infatuated (father of a family as he was, though horribly bored by the provincial life of Saumur) with a pretty actress at the Theatre de Madame, known as Florine, and he presently relapsed into the old habits of his army life. It is useless to speak of his conduct; Saumur considered it profoundly immoral. His wife was fortunate in the fact of her property being settled upon herself, and in having sufficient ability to keep up the banking-house in Saumur, which was managed in her name and repaired the breach in her fortune caused by the extravagance of her husband. The Cruchotines made so much talk about the false position of the quasi-widow that she married her daughter very badly, and was forced to give up all hope of an alliance between Eugenie Grandet and her son. Adolphe joined his father in Paris and became, it was said, a worthless fellow. The Cruchots triumphed.

“Your husband hasn’t common sense,” said Grandet as he lent Madame des Grassins some money on a note securely endorsed. “I am very sorry for you, for you are a good little woman.”

“Ah, monsieur,” said the poor lady, “who could have believed that when he left Saumur to go to Paris on your business he was going to his ruin?”

“Heaven is my witness, madame, that up to the last moment I did all I could to prevent him from going. Monsieur le president was most anxious to take his place; but he was determined to go, and now we all see why.”

In this way Grandet made it quite plain that he was under no obligation to des Grassins.





V


In all situations women have more cause for suffering than men, and they suffer more. Man has strength and the power of exercising it; he acts, moves, thinks, occupies himself; he looks ahead, and sees consolation in the future. It was thus with Charles. But the woman stays at home; she is always face to face with the grief from which nothing distracts her; she goes down to the depths of the abyss which yawns before her, measures it, and often fills it with her tears and prayers. Thus did Eugenie. She initiated herself into her destiny. To feel, to love, to suffer, to devote herself—is not this the sum of woman’s life? Eugenie was to be in all things a woman, except in the one thing that consoles for all. Her happiness, picked up like nails scattered on a wall—to use the fine simile of Bossuet—would never so much as fill even the hollow of her hand. Sorrows are never long in coming; for her they came soon. The day after Charles’s departure the house of Monsieur Grandet resumed its ordinary aspect in the eyes of all, except in those of Eugenie, to whom it grew suddenly empty. She wished, if it could be done unknown to her father, that Charles’s room might be kept as he had left it. Madame Grandet and Nanon were willing accomplices in this statu quo.

“Who knows but he may come back sooner than we think for?”she said.

“Ah, don’t I wish I could see him back!” answered Nanon. “I took to him! He was such a dear, sweet young man—pretty too, with his curly hair.”

Eugenie looked at Nanon.

“Holy Virgin! don’t look at me that way, mademoiselle; your eyes are like those of a lost soul.”

From that day the beauty of Mademoiselle Grandet took a new character. The solemn thoughts of love which slowly filled her soul, and the dignity of the woman beloved, gave to her features an illumination such as painters render by a halo. Before the coming of her cousin, Eugenie might be compared to the Virgin before the conception; after he had gone, she was like the Virgin Mother—she had given birth to love. These two Marys so different, so well represented by Spanish art, embody one of those shining symbols with which Christianity abounds. Returning from Mass on the morning after Charles’s departure—having made a vow to hear it daily—Eugenie bought a map of the world, which she nailed up beside her looking-glass, that she might follow her cousin on his westward way, that she might put herself, were it ever so little, day by day into the ship that bore him, and see him and ask him a thousand questions—

“Art thou well? Dost thou suffer? Dost thou think of me when the star, whose beauty and usefulness thou hast taught me to know, shines upon thee?”

In the mornings she sat pensive beneath the walnut-tree, on the worm-eaten bench covered with gray lichens, where they had said to each other so many precious things, so many trifles, where they had built the pretty castles of their future home. She thought of the future now as she looked upward to the bit of sky which was all the high walls suffered her to see; then she turned her eyes to the angle where the sun crept on, and to the roof above the room in which he had slept. Hers was the solitary love, the persistent love, which glides into every thought and becomes the substance, or, as our fathers might have said, the tissue of life.

When the would-be friends of Pere Grandet came in the evening for their game at cards, she was gay and dissimulating; but all the morning she talked of Charles with her mother and Nanon. Nanon had brought herself to see that she could pity the sufferings of her young mistress without failing in her duty to the old master, and she would say to Eugenie—

“If I had a man for myself I’d—I’d follow him to hell, yes, I’d exterminate myself for him; but I’ve none. I shall die and never know what life is. Would you believe, mamz’elle, that old Cornoiller (a good fellow all the same) is always round my petticoats for the sake of my money—just for all the world like the rats who come smelling after the master’s cheese and paying court to you? I see it all; I’ve got a shrewd eye, though I am as big as a steeple. Well, mamz’elle, it pleases me, but it isn’t love.”

Two months went by. This domestic life, once so monotonous, was now quickened with the intense interest of a secret that bound these women intimately together. For them Charles lived and moved beneath the grim gray rafters of the hall. Night and morning Eugenie opened the dressing-case and gazed at the portrait of her aunt. One Sunday morning her mother surprised her as she stood absorbed in finding her cousin’s features in his mother’s face. Madame Grandet was then for the first time admitted into the terrible secret of the exchange made by Charles against her daughter’s treasure.

“You gave him all!” cried the poor mother, terrified. “What will you say to your father on New Year’s Day when he asks to see your gold?”

Eugenie’s eyes grew fixed, and the two women lived through mortal terror for more than half the morning. They were so troubled in mind that they missed high Mass, and only went to the military service.

In three days the year 1819 would come to an end. In three days a terrible drama would begin, a bourgeois tragedy, without poison, or dagger, or the spilling of blood; but—as regards the actors in it—more cruel than all the fabled horrors in the family of the Atrides.

“What will become of us?” said Madame Grandet to her daughter, letting her knitting fall upon her knees.

The poor mother had gone through such anxiety for the past two months that the woollen sleeves which she needed for the coming winter were not yet finished. This domestic fact, insignificant as it seems, bore sad results. For want of those sleeves, a chill seized her in the midst of a sweat caused by a terrible explosion of anger on the part of her husband.

“I have been thinking, my poor child, that if you had confided your secret to me we should have had time to write to Monsieur des Grassins in Paris. He might have sent us gold pieces like yours;though Grandet knows them all, perhaps—”

“Where could we have got the money?”

“I would have pledged my own property. Besides, Monsieur des Grassins would have—”

“It is too late,” said Eugenie in a broken, hollow voice. “To-morrow morning we must go and wish him a happy New Year in his chamber.”

“But, my daughter, why should I not consult the Cruchots?”

“No, no; it would be delivering me up to them, and putting ourselves in their power. Besides, I have chosen my course. I have done right, I repent of nothing. God will protect me. His will be done! Ah! mother, if you had read his letter, you, too, would have thought only of him.”

The next morning, January 1, 1820, the horrible fear to which mother and daughter were a prey suggested to their minds a natural excuse by which to escape the solemn entrance into Grandet’s chamber. The winter of 1819-1820 was one of the coldest of that epoch. The snow encumbered the roofs.

Madame Grandet called to her husband as soon as she heard him stirring in his chamber, and said—

“Grandet, will you let Nanon light a fire here for me? The cold is so sharp that I am freezing under the bedclothes. At my age I need some comforts. Besides,” she added, after a slight pause, “Eugenie shall come and dress here; the poor child might get an illness from dressing in her cold room in such weather. Then we will go and wish you a happy New Year beside the fire in the hall.”

“Ta, ta, ta, ta, what a tongue! a pretty way to begin the new year, Madame Grandet! You never talked so much before; but you haven’t been sopping your bread in wine, I know that.”

There was a moment’s silence.

“Well,” resumed the goodman, who no doubt had some reason of his own for agreeing to his wife’s request, “I’ll do what you ask, Madame Grandet. You are a good woman, and I don’t want any harm to happen to you at your time of life—though as a general thing the Bertellieres are as sound as a roach. Hein! isn’t that so?” he added after a pause. “Well, I forgive them; we got their property in the end.”

And he coughed.

“You are very gay this morning, monsieur,” said the poor woman gravely.

“I’m always gay—

“‘Gai, gai, gai, le tonnelier,

Raccommodez votre cuvier!’”

he answered, entering his wife’s room fully dressed. “Yes, on my word, it is cold enough to freeze you solid. We shall have a fine breakfast, wife. Des Grassins has sent me a pate-de-foie-gras truffled! I am going now to get it at the coach-office. There’ll be a double napoleon for Eugenie in the package,” he whispered in Madame Grandet’s ear.

“I have no gold left, wife. I had a few stray pieces—I don’t mind telling you that—but I had to let them go in business.”

Then, by way of celebrating the new year, he kissed her on the forehead.

“Eugenie,” cried the mother, when Grandet was fairly gone, “I don’t know which side of the bed your father got out of, but he is good-tempered this morning. Perhaps we shall come out safe after all?”

“What’s happened to the master?” said Nanon, entering her mistress’s room to light the fire. “First place, he said, ‘Good-morning;happy New Year, you big fool! Go and light my wife’s fire, she’s cold’; and then, didn’t I feel silly when he held out his hand and gave me a six-franc piece, which isn’t worn one bit? Just look at it, madame! Oh, the kind man! He is a good man, that’s a fact. There are some people who the older they get the harder they grow; but he—why he’s getting soft and improving with time, like your ratafia! He is a good, good man—”

The secret of Grandet’s joy lay in the complete success of his speculation. Monsieur des Grassins, after deducting the amount which the old cooper owed him for the discount on a hundred and fifty thousand francs in Dutch notes, and for the surplus which he had advanced to make up the sum required for the investment in the Funds which was to produce a hundred thousand francs a year, had now sent him, by the diligence, thirty thousand francs in silver coin, the remainder of his first half-year’s interest, informing him at the same time that the Funds had already gone up in value. They were then quoted at eighty-nine; the shrewdest capitalists bought in, towards the last of January, at ninety-three. Grandet had thus gained in two months twelve per cent on his capital; he had simplified his accounts, and would in future receive fifty thousand francs interest every six months, without incurring any taxes or costs for repairs. He understood at last what it was to invest money in the public securities—a system for which provincials have always shown a marked repugnance—and at the end of five years he found himself master of a capital of six millions, which increased without much effort of his own, and which, joined to the value and proceeds of his territorial possessions, gave him a fortune that was absolutely colossal. The six francs bestowed on Nanon were perhaps the reward of some great service which the poor servant had rendered to her master unawares.

“Oh! oh! where’s Pere Grandet going? He has been scurrying about since sunrise as if to a fire,” said the tradespeople to each other as they opened their shops for the day.

When they saw him coming back from the wharf, followed by a porter from the coach-office wheeling a barrow which was laden with sacks, they all had their comments to make— “Water flows to the river; the old fellow was running after his gold,” said one.

“He gets it from Paris and Froidfond and Holland,” said another.

“He’ll end by buying up Saumur,” cried a third.

“He doesn’t mind the cold, he’s so wrapped up in his gains,”said a wife to her husband.

“Hey! hey! Monsieur Grandet, if that’s too heavy for you,” said a cloth-dealer, his nearest neighbor, “I’ll take it off your hands.”

“Heavy?” said the cooper, “I should think so; it’s all sous!”

“Silver sous,” said the porter in a low voice.

“If you want me to take care of you, keep your tongue between your teeth,” said the goodman to the porter as they reached the door.

“The old fox! I thought he was deaf; seems he can hear fast enough in frosty weather.”

“Here’s twenty sous for your New Year, and mum!” said Grandet. “Be off with you! Nanon shall take back your barrow. Nanon, are the linnets at church?”

“Yes, monsieur.”

“Then lend a hand! go to work!” he cried, piling the sacks upon her.

In a few moments all were carried up to his inner room, where he shut himself in with them.

“When breakfast is ready, knock on the wall,” he said as he disappeared. “Take the barrow back to the coach-office.”

The family did not breakfast that day until ten o’clock.

“Your father will not ask to see your gold downstairs,” said Madame Grandet as they got back from Mass. “You must pretend to be very chilly. We may have time to replace the treasure before your fete-day.”

Grandet came down the staircase thinking of his splendid speculation in government securities, and wondering how he could metamorphose his Parisian silver into solid gold; he was making up his mind to invest in this way everything he could lay hands on until the Funds should reach a par value. Fatal reverie for Eugenie! As soon as he came in, the two women wished him a happy New Year—his daughter by putting her arms round his neck and caressing him; Madame Grandet gravely and with dignity.

“Ha! Ha! My child,” he said, kissing his daughter on both cheeks. “I work for you, don’t you see? I think of your happiness. Must have money to be happy. Without money there’s not a particle of happiness. Here! There’s a new napoleon for you. I sent to Paris for it. On my word of honor, it’s all the gold I have; you are the only one that has got any gold. I want to see your gold, little one.”

“Oh! it is too cold; let us have breakfast,” answered Eugenie.

“Well, after breakfast, then; it will help the digestion. That fat des Grassins sent me the pate. Eat as much as you like, my children, it costs nothing. Des Grassins is getting along very well. I am satisfied with him. The old fish is doing Charles a good service, and gratis too. He is making a very good settlement of that poor deceased Grandet’s business. Hoo! hoo!” he muttered, with his mouth full, after a pause, “how good it is! Eat some, wife; that will feed you for at least two days.”

“I am not hungry. I am very poorly; you know that.”

“Ah, bah! you can stuff yourself as full as you please without danger, you’re a Bertelliere; they are all hearty. You are a bit yellow, that’s true; but I like yellow, myself.”

The expectation of ignominious and public death is perhaps less horrible to a condemned criminal than the anticipation of what was coming after breakfast to Madame Grandet and Eugenie. The more gleefully the old man talked and ate, the more their hearts shrank within them. The daughter, however, had an inward prop at this crisis—she gathered strength through love.

“For him! for him!” she cried within her, “I would die a thousand deaths.”

At this thought, she shot a glance at her mother which flamed with courage.

“Clear away,” said Grandet to Nanon when, about eleven o’clock, breakfast was over, “but leave the table. We can spread your little treasure upon it,” he said, looking at Eugenie. “Little? Faith! no; it isn’t little. You possess, in actual value, five thousand nine hundred and fifty-nine francs and the forty I gave you just now. That makes six thousand francs, less one. Well, now see here, little one! I’ll give you that one franc to make up the round number. Hey! what are you listening for, Nanon? Mind your own business; go and do your work.”

Nanon disappeared.

“Now listen, Eugenie; you must give me back your gold. You won’t refuse your father, my little girl, hein?”

The two women were dumb.

“I have no gold myself. I had some, but it is all gone. I’ll give you in return six thousand francs in livres, and you are to put them just where I tell you. You mustn’t think anything more about your‘dozen.’ When I marry you (which will be soon) I shall get you a husband who can give you the finest ‘dozen’ ever seen in the provinces. Now attend to me, little girl. There’s a fine chance for you; you can put your six thousand francs into government funds, and you will receive every six months nearly two hundred francs interest, without taxes, or repairs, or frost, or hail, or floods, or anything else to swallow up the money. Perhaps you don’t like to part with your gold, hey, my girl? Never mind, bring it to me all the same. I’ll get you some more like it—like those Dutch coins and the portugaises, the rupees of Mogul, and the genovines—I’ll give you some more on your fete-days, and in three years you’ll have got back half your little treasure. What’s that you say? Look up, now. Come, go and get it, the precious metal. You ought to kiss me on the eyelids for telling you the secrets and the mysteries of the life and death of money. Yes, silver and gold live and swarm like men; they come, and go, and sweat, and multiply—”

Eugenie rose; but after making a few steps towards the door she turned abruptly, looked her father in the face, and said—

“I have not got my gold.”

“You have not got your gold!” cried Grandet, starting up erect, like a horse that hears a cannon fired beside him.

“No, I have not got it.”

“You are mistaken, Eugenie.”

“No.”

“By the shears of my father!”

Whenever the old man swore that oath the rafters trembled.

“Holy Virgin! Madame is turning pale,” cried Nanon.

“Grandet, your anger will kill me,” said the poor mother.

“Ta, ta, ta, ta! nonsense; you never die in your family! Eugenie, what have you done with your gold?” he cried, rushing upon her.

“Monsieur,” said the daughter, falling at Madame Grandet’s knees, “my mother is ill. Look at her; do not kill her.”

Grandet was frightened by the pallor which overspread his wife’s face, usually so yellow.

“Nanon, help me to bed,” said the poor woman in a feeble voice; “I am dying—”

Nanon gave her mistress an arm, Eugenie gave her another; but it was only with infinite difficulty that they could get her upstairs, she fell with exhaustion at every step. Grandet remained alone. However, in a few moments he went up six or eight stairs and called out—

“Eugenie, when your mother is in bed, come down.”

“Yes, father.”

She soon came, after reassuring her mother.

“My daughter,” said Grandet, “you will now tell me what you have done with your gold.”

“My father, if you make me presents of which I am not the sole mistress, take them back,” she answered coldly, picking up the napoleon from the chimney-piece and offering it to him.

Grandet seized the coin and slipped it into his breeches’ pocket.

“I shall certainly never give you anything again. Not so much as that!” he said, clicking his thumb-nail against a front tooth. “Do you dare to despise your father? Have you no confidence in him? Don’t you know what a father is? If he is nothing for you, he is nothing at all. Where is your gold?”

“Father, I love and respect you, in spite of your anger; but I humbly ask you to remember that I am twenty-three years old. You have told me often that I have attained my majority, and I do not forget it. I have used my money as I chose to use it, and you may be sure that it was put to a good use—”

“What use?”

“That is an inviolable secret,” she answered. “Have you no secrets?”

“I am the head of the family; I have my own affairs.”

“And this is mine.”

“It must be something bad if you can’t tell it to your father, Mademoiselle Grandet.”

“It is good, and I cannot tell it to my father.”

“At least you can tell me when you parted with your gold?”

Eugenie made a negative motion with her head.

“You had it on your birthday, hein?”

She grew as crafty through love as her father was through avarice, and reiterated the negative sign.

“Was there ever such obstinacy! It’s a theft,” cried Grandet, his voice going up in a crescendo which gradually echoed through the house. “What! here, in my own home, under my very eyes,somebody has taken your gold—the only gold we have—and I’m not to know who has got it! Gold is a precious thing. Virtuous girls go wrong sometimes, and give—I don’t know what; they do it among the great people, and even among the bourgeoisie. But give their gold! For you have given it to some one, hein?”

Eugenie was silent and impassive.

“Was there ever such a daughter? Is it possible that I am your father? If you have invested it anywhere, you must have a receipt—”

“Was I free—yes or no—to do what I would with my own? Was it not mine?”

“You are a child.”

“Of age.”

Dumbfounded by his daughter’s logic, Grandet turned pale and stamped and swore.

When at last he found words, he cried: “Serpent! Cursed girl! Ah, deceitful creature! You know I love you, and you take advantage of it. She’d cut her father’s throat! Good God! you’ve given our fortune to that ne’er-do-well—that dandy with morocco boots! By the shears of my father! I can’t disinherit you, but I curse you—you and your cousin and your children! Nothing good will come of it! Do you hear? If it was to Charles—but, no; it’s impossible. What! Has that wretched fellow robbed me?”

He looked at his daughter, who continued cold and silent.

“She won’t stir; she won’t flinch! She’s more Grandet than I’m Grandet! Ha! you have not given your gold for nothing? Come, speak the truth!”

Eugenie looked at her father with a sarcastic expression that stung him.

“Eugenie, you are here, in my house—in your father’s house. If you wish to stay here, you must submit yourself to me. The priests tell you to obey me.”

Eugenie bowed her head.

“You affront me in all I hold most dear. I will not see you again until you submit. Go to your chamber. You will stay there till I give you permission to leave it. Nanon will bring you bread and water. You hear me—go!”

Eugenie burst into tears and fled up to her mother.

Grandet, after marching two or three times round the garden in the snow without heeding the cold, suddenly suspected that his daughter had gone to her mother; only too happy to find her disobedient to his orders, he climbed the stairs with the agility of a cat and appeared in Madame Grandet’s room just as she was stroking Eugenie’s hair, while the girl’s face was hidden in her motherly bosom.

“Be comforted, my poor child,” she was saying; “your father will get over it.”

“She has no father!” said the old man. “Can it be you and I, Madame Grandet, who have given birth to such a disobedient child? A fine education—religious, too! Well! why are you not in your chamber? Come, to prison, to prison, mademoiselle!”

“Would you deprive me of my daughter, monsieur?” said Madame Grandet, turning towards him a face that was now red with fever.

“If you want to keep her, carry her off! Clear out—out of my house, both of you! Thunder! where is the gold? what’s become of the gold?”

Eugenie rose, looked proudly at her father, and withdrew to her room. Grandet turned the key of the door.

“Nanon,” he cried, “put out the fire in the hall.”

Then he sat down in an armchair beside his wife’s fire and said to her—

“Undoubtedly she has given the gold to that miserable seducer, Charles, who only wanted our money.”

“I knew nothing about it,” she answered, turning to the other side of the bed, that she might escape the savage glances of her husband. “I suffer so much from your violence that I shall never leave this room, if I trust my own presentiments, till I am carried out of it in my coffin. You ought to have spared me this suffering, monsieur—you, to whom I have caused no pain; that is, I think so. Your daughter loves you. I believe her to be as innocent as the babe unborn. Do not make her wretched. Revoke your sentence. The cold is very severe; you may give her some serious illness.”

“I will not see her, neither will I speak to her. She shall stay in her room, on bread and water, until she submits to her father. What the devil! shouldn’t a father know where the gold in his house has gone to? She owned the only rupees in France, perhaps, and the Dutch ducats and the genovines—”

“Monsieur, Eugenie is our only child; and even if she had thrown them into the water—”

“Into the water!” cried her husband; “into the water! You are crazy, Madame Grandet! What I have said is said; you know that well enough. If you want peace in this household, make your daughter confess, pump it out of her. Women understand how to do that better than we do. Whatever she has done, I sha’n’t eat her. Is she afraid of me? Even if she has plastered Charles with gold from head to foot, he is on the high seas, and nobody can get at him, hein!”

“But, monsieur—”

Excited by the nervous crisis through which she had passed, and by the fate of her daughter, which brought forth all her tenderness and all her powers of mind, Madame Grandet suddenly observed a frightful movement of her husband’s wen, and, in the very act of replying, she changed her speech without changing the tones of her voice—

“But, monsieur, I have not more influence over her than you have. She has said nothing to me; she takes after you.”

“Tut, tut! Your tongue is hung in the middle this morning. Ta, ta, ta, ta! You are setting me at defiance, I do believe. I daresay you are in league with her.”

He looked fixedly at his wife.

“Monsieur Grandet, if you wish to kill me, you have only to go on like this. I tell you, monsieur—and if it were to cost me my life, I would say it—you do wrong by your daughter; she is more in the right than you are. That money belonged to her; she is incapable of making any but a good use of it, and God alone has the right to know our good deeds. Monsieur, I implore you, take Eugenie back into favor; forgive her. If you will do this you will lessen the injury your anger has done me; perhaps you will save my life. My daughter! oh, monsieur, give me back my daughter!”

“I shall decamp,” he said; “the house is not habitable. A mother and daughter talking and arguing like that! Broooouh! Pouah! A fine New Year’s present you’ve made me, Eugenie,” he called out.“Yes, yes, cry away! What you’ve done will bring you remorse, do you hear? What’s the good of taking the sacrament six times every three months, if you give away your father’s gold secretly to an idle fellow who’ll eat your heart out when you’ve nothing else to give him? You’ll find out some day what your Charles is worth, with his morocco boots and supercilious airs. He has got neither heart nor soul if he dared to carry off a young girl’s treasure without the consent of her parents.”

When the street-door was shut, Eugenie came out of her room and went to her mother.

“What courage you have had for your daughter’s sake!” she said.

“Ah! my child, see where forbidden things may lead us. You forced me to tell a lie.”

“I will ask God to punish only me.”

“Is it true,” cried Nanon, rushing in alarmed, “that mademoiselle is to be kept on bread and water for the rest of her life?”

“What does that signify, Nanon?” said Eugenie tranquilly.

“Goodness! do you suppose I’ll eat frippe when the daughter of the house is eating dry bread? No, no!”

“Don’t say a word about all this, Nanon,” said Eugenie.

“I’ll be as mute as a fish; but you’ll see!”

Grandet dined alone for the first time in twenty-four years.

“So you’re a widower, monsieur,” said Nanon; “it must be disagreeable to be a widower with two women in the house.”

“I did not speak to you. Hold your jaw, or I’ll turn you off! What is that I hear boiling in your saucepan on the stove?”

“It is grease I’m trying out.”

“There will be some company to-night. Light the fire.”

The Cruchots, Madame des Grassins, and her son arrived at the usual hour of eight, and were surprised to see neither Madame Grandet nor her daughter.

“My wife is not very well, and Eugenie is with her,” said the old wine-grower, whose face betrayed no emotion.

At the end of an hour spent in idle conversation, Madame des Grassins, who had gone up to see Madame Grandet, came down, and every one inquired—

“How is Madame Grandet?”

“Not at all well,” she answered; “her condition seems to me really alarming. At her age you ought to take every precaution, Papa Grandet.”

“We’ll see about it,” said the old man in an absent way.

They all wished him good-night. When the Cruchots got into the street Madame des Grassins said to them—

“There is something going on at the Grandets. The mother is very ill without her knowing it. The girl’s eyes are red, as if she had been crying all day. Can they be trying to marry her against her will?”

When Grandet had gone to bed Nanon came softly to Eugenie’s room in her stockinged feet and showed her a pate baked in a saucepan.

“See, mademoiselle,” said the good soul, “Cornoiller gave me a hare. You eat so little that this pate will last you full a week; in such frosty weather it won’t spoil. You sha’n’t live on dry bread, I’m determined; it isn’t wholesome.”

“Poor Nanon!” said Eugenie, pressing her hand.

“I’ve made it downright good and dainty, and he never found it out. I bought the lard and the spices out of my six francs: I’m the mistress of my own money;” and she disappeared rapidly, fancying she heard Grandet.

For several months the old wine-grower came constantly to his wife’s room at all hours of the day, without ever uttering his daughter’s name, or seeing her, or making the smallest allusion to her. Madame Grandet did not leave her chamber, and daily grew worse. Nothing softened the old man; he remained unmoved, harsh, and cold as a granite rock. He continued to go and come about his business as usual; but ceased to stutter, talked less, and was more obdurate in business transactions than ever before. Often he made mistakes in adding up his figures.

“Something is going on at the Grandets,” said the Grassinists and the Cruchotines.

“What has happened in the Grandet family?” became a fixed question which everybody asked everybody else at the little evening-parties of Saumur.

Eugenie went to Mass escorted by Nanon. If Madame des Grassins said a few words to her on coming out of church, she answered in an evasive manner, without satisfying any curiosity. However, at the end of two months, it became impossible to hide, either from the three Cruchots or from Madame des Grassins, the fact that Eugenie was in confinement. There came a moment when all pretexts failed to explain her perpetual absence. Then, though it was impossible to discover by whom the secret had been betrayed, all the town became aware that ever since New Year’s day Mademoiselle Grandet had been kept in her room without fire, on bread and water, by her father’s orders, and that Nanon cooked little dainties and took them to her secretly at night. It was even known that the young woman was not able to see or take care of her mother, except at certain times when her father was out of the house.

Grandet’s conduct was severely condemned. The whole town outlawed him, so to speak; they remembered his treachery, his hard-heartedness, and they excommunicated him. When he passed along the streets, people pointed him out and muttered at him.

When his daughter came down the winding street, accompanied by Nanon, on her way to Mass or Vespers, the inhabitants ran to the windows and examined with intense curiosity the bearing of the rich heiress and her countenance, which bore the impress of angelic gentleness and melancholy. Her imprisonment and the condemnation of her father were as nothing to her. Had she not a map of the world, the little bench, the garden, the angle of the wall? Did she not taste upon her lips the honey that love’s kisses left there? She was ignorant for a time that the town talked about her, just as Grandet himself was ignorant of it. Pious and pure in heart before God, her conscience and her love helped her to suffer patiently the wrath and vengeance of her father.

One deep grief silenced all others. Her mother, that gentle, tender creature, made beautiful by the light which shone from the inner to the outer as she approached the tomb—her mother was perishing from day to day. Eugenie often reproached herself as the innocent cause of the slow, cruel malady that was wasting her away. This remorse, though her mother soothed it, bound her still closer to her love. Every morning, as soon as her father left the house, she went to the bedside of her mother, and there Nanon brought her breakfast. The poor girl, sad, and suffering through the sufferings of her mother, would turn her face to the old servant with a mute gesture, weeping, and yet not daring to speak of her cousin. It was Madame Grandet who first found courage to say—

“Where is he? Why does he not write?”

“Let us think about him, mother, but not speak of him. You are ill—you, before all.”

“All” meant “him.”

“My child,” said Madame Grandet, “I do not wish to live. God protects me and enables me to look with joy to the end of my misery.”

Every utterance of this woman was unfalteringly pious and Christian. Sometimes, during the first months of the year, when her husband came to breakfast with her and tramped up and down the room, she would say to him a few religious words, always spoken with angelic sweetness, yet with the firmness of a woman to whom approaching death lends a courage she had lacked in life.

“Monsieur, I thank you for the interest you take in my health,”she would answer when he made some commonplace inquiry; “but if you really desire to render my last moments less bitter and to ease my grief, take back your daughter: be a Christian, a husband, and a father.”

When he heard these words, Grandet would sit down by the bed with the air of a man who sees the rain coming and quietly gets under the shelter of a gateway till it is over. When these touching, tender, and religious supplications had all been made, he would say—

“You are rather pale to-day, my poor wife.”

Absolute forgetfulness of his daughter seemed graven on his stony brow, on his closed lips. He was unmoved by the tears which flowed down the white cheeks of his unhappy wife as she listened to his meaningless answers.

“May God pardon you,” she said, “even as I pardon you! You will some day stand in need of mercy.”

Since Madame Grandet’s illness he had not dared to make use of his terrible “Ta, ta, ta, ta!” Yet, for all that, his despotic nature was not disarmed by this angel of gentleness, whose ugliness day by day decreased, driven out by the ineffable expression of moral qualities which shone upon her face.

She was all soul. The spirit of prayer seemed to purify her and refine those homely features and make them luminous. Who has not seen the phenomenon of a like transfiguration on sacred faces where the habits of the soul have triumphed over the plainest features, giving them that spiritual illumination whose light comes from the purity and nobility of the inward thought? The spectacle of this transformation wrought by the struggle which consumed the last shreds of the human life of this woman, did somewhat affect the old cooper, though feebly, for his nature was of iron; if his language ceased to be contemptuous, an imperturbable silence, which saved his dignity as master of the household, took its place and ruled his conduct.

When the faithful Nanon appeared in the market, many quips and quirks and complaints about the master whistled in her ears; but however loudly public opinion condemned Monsieur Grandet, the old servant defended him, for the honor of the family.

“Well!” she would say to his detractors, “don’t we all get hard as we grow old? Why shouldn’t he get horny too? Stop telling lies. Mademoiselle lives like a queen. She’s alone, that’s true; but she likes it. Besides, my masters have good reasons.”

At last, towards the end of spring, Madame Grandet, worn out by grief even more than by illness, having failed, in spite of her prayers, to reconcile the father and daughter, confided her secret troubles to the Cruchots.

“Keep a girl of twenty-three on bread and water!” cried Monsieur de Bonfons; “without any reason, too! Why, that constitutes wrongful cruelty; she can contest, as much in as upon—”

“Come, nephew, spare us your legal jargon,” said the notary. “Set your mind at ease, madame; I will put a stop to such treatment to-morrow.”

Eugenie, hearing herself mentioned, came out of her room.

“Gentlemen,” she said, coming forward with a proud step, “I beg you not to interfere in this matter. My father is master in his own house. As long as I live under his roof I am bound to obey him. His conduct is not subject to the approbation or the disapprobation of the world; he is accountable to God only. I appeal to your friendship to keep total silence in this affair. To blame my father is to attack our family honor. I am much obliged to you for the interest you have shown in me; you will do me an additional service if you will put a stop to the offensive rumors which are current in the town, of which I am accidentally informed.”

“She is right,” said Madame Grandet.

“Mademoiselle, the best way to stop such rumors is to procure your liberty,” answered the old notary respectfully, struck with the beauty which seclusion, melancholy, and love had stamped upon her face.

“Well, my daughter, let Monsieur Cruchot manage the matter if he is so sure of success. He understands your father, and how to manage him. If you wish to see me happy for my few remaining days, you must, at any cost, be reconciled to your father.”

On the morrow Grandet, in pursuance of a custom he had begun since Eugenie’s imprisonment, took a certain number of turns up and down the little garden; he had chosen the hour when Eugenie brushed and arranged her hair. When the old man reached the walnut-tree he hid behind its trunk and remained for a few moments watching his daughter’s movements, hesitating, perhaps, between the course to which the obstinacy of his character impelled him and his natural desire to embrace his child. Sometimes he sat down on the rotten old bench where Charles and Eugenie had vowed eternal love; and then she, too, looked at her father secretly in the mirror before which she stood. If he rose and continued his walk, she sat down obligingly at the window and looked at the angle of the wall where the pale flowers hung, where the Venus-hair grew from the crevices with the bindweed and the sedum—a white or yellow stone-crop very abundant in the vineyards of Saumur and at Tours. Maitre Cruchot came early, and found the old wine-grower sitting in the fine June weather on the little bench, his back against the division wall of the garden, engaged in watching his daughter.

“What may you want, Maitre Cruchot?” he said, perceiving the notary.

“I came to speak to you on business.”

“Ah! ah! have you brought some gold in exchange for my silver?”

“No, no, I have not come about money; it is about your daughter Eugenie. All the town is talking of her and you.”

“What does the town meddle for? A man’s house is his castle.”

“Very true; and a man may kill himself if he likes, or, what is worse, he may fling his money into the gutter.”

“What do you mean?”

“Why, your wife is very ill, my friend. You ought to consult Monsieur Bergerin; she is likely to die. If she does die without receiving proper care, you will not be very easy in mind, I take it.”

“Ta, ta, ta, ta! you know a deal about my wife! These doctors, if they once get their foot in your house, will come five and six times a day.”

“Of course you will do as you think best. We are old friends;there is no one in all Saumur who takes more interest than I in what concerns you. Therefore, I was bound to tell you this. However, happen what may, you have the right to do as you please; you can choose your own course. Besides, that is not what brings me here. There is another thing which may have serious results for you. After all, you can’t wish to kill your wife; her life is too important to you. Think of your situation in connection with your daughter if Madame Grandet dies. You must render an account to Eugenie, because you enjoy your wife’s estate only during her lifetime. At her death your daughter can claim a division of property, and she may force you to sell Froidfond. In short, she is her mother’s heir, and you are not.”

These words fell like a thunderbolt on the old man, who was not as wise about law as he was about business. He had never thought of a legal division of the estate.

“Therefore I advise you to treat her kindly,” added Cruchot, in conclusion.

“But do you know what she has done, Cruchot?”

“What?” asked the notary, curious to hear the truth and find out the cause of the quarrel.

“She has given away her gold!”

“Well, wasn’t it hers?” said the notary.

“They all tell me that!” exclaimed the old man, letting his arms fall to his sides with a movement that was truly tragic.

“Are you going—for a mere nothing,” resumed Cruchot, “to put obstacles in the way of the concessions which you will be obliged to ask from your daughter as soon as her mother dies?”

“Do you call six thousand francs a mere nothing?”

“Hey! my old friend, do you know what the inventory of your wife’s property will cost, if Eugenie demands the division?”

“How much?”

“Two, three, four thousand francs, perhaps! The property would have to be put up at auction and sold, to get at its actual value. Instead of that, if you are on good terms with—”

“By the shears of my father!” cried Grandet, turning pale as he suddenly sat down, “we will see about it, Cruchot.”

After a moment’s silence, full of anguish perhaps, the old man looked at the notary and said—

“Life is very hard! It has many griefs! Cruchot,” he continued solemnly, “you would not deceive me? Swear to me upon your honor that all you’ve told me is legally true. Show me the law; I must see the law!”

“My poor friend,” said the notary, “don’t I know my own business?”

“Then it is true! I am robbed, betrayed, killed, destroyed by my own daughter!”

“It is true that your daughter is her mother’s heir.”

“Why do we have children? Ah! my wife, I love her! Luckily she’s sound and healthy; she’s a Bertelliere.”

“She has not a month to live.”

Grandet struck his forehead, went a few steps, came back, cast a dreadful look on Cruchot, and said—

“What can be done?”

“Eugenie can relinquish her claim to her mother’s property. Should she do this you would not disinherit her, I presume?—but if you want to come to such a settlement, you must not treat her harshly. What I am telling you, old man, is against my own interests. What do I live by, if it isn’t liquidations, inventories, conveyances, divisions of property?—”

“We’ll see, we’ll see! Don’t let’s talk any more about it, Cruchot; it wrings my vitals. Have you received any gold?”

“No; but I have a few old louis, a dozen or so, which you may have. My good friend, make it up with Eugenie. Don’t you know all Saumur is pelting you with stones?”

“The scoundrels!”

“Come, the Funds are at ninety-nine. Do be satisfied for once in your life.”

“At ninety-nine! Are they, Cruchot?”

“Yes.”

“Hey, hey! Ninety-nine!” repeated the old man, accompanying the notary to the street-door. Then, too agitated by what he had just heard to stay in the house, he went up to his wife’s room and said—

“Come, mother, you may have your daughter to spend the day with you. I’m going to Froidfond. Enjoy yourselves, both of you. This is our wedding-day, wife. See! here are sixty francs for your altar at the Fete-Dieu; you’ve wanted one for a long time. Come, cheer up, enjoy yourself, and get well! Hurrah for happiness!”

He threw ten silver pieces of six francs each upon the bed, and took his wife’s head between his hands and kissed her forehead.

“My good wife, you are getting well, are not you?”

“How can you think of receiving the God of mercy in your house when you refuse to forgive your daughter?” she said with emotion.

“Ta, ta, ta, ta!” said Grandet in a coaxing voice. “We’ll see about that.”

“Merciful heaven! Eugenie,” cried the mother, flushing with joy, “come and kiss your father; he forgives you!”

But the old man had disappeared. He was going as fast as his legs could carry him towards his vineyards, trying to get his confused ideas into order. Grandet had entered his seventy-sixth year. During the last two years his avarice had increased upon him, as all the persistent passions of men increase at a certain age. As if to illustrate an observation which applies equally to misers, ambitious men, and others whose lives are controlled by any dominant idea, his affections had fastened upon one special symbol of his passion. The sight of gold, the possession of gold, had become a monomania. His despotic spirit had grown in proportion to his avarice, and to part with the control of the smallest fraction of his property at the death of his wife seemed to him a thing “against nature.” To declare his fortune to his daughter, to give an inventory of his property, landed and personal, for the purposes of division—

“Why,” he cried aloud in the midst of a field where he was pretending to examine a vine, “it would be cutting my throat!”

He came at last to a decision, and returned to Saumur in time for dinner, resolved to unbend to Eugenie, and pet and coax her, that he might die regally, holding the reins of his millions in his own hands so long as the breath was in his body. At the moment when the old man, who chanced to have his pass-key in his pocket, opened the door and climbed with a stealthy step up the stairway to go into his wife’s room, Eugenie had brought the beautiful dressing-case from the oak cabinet and placed it on her mother’s bed. Mother and daughter, in Grandet’s absence, allowed themselves the pleasure of looking for a likeness to Charles in the portrait of his mother.

“It is exactly his forehead and his mouth,” Eugenie was saying as the old man opened the door.

At the look which her husband cast upon the gold, Madame Grandet cried out—

“O God, have pity upon us!”

The old man sprang upon the box as a famished tiger might spring upon a sleeping child.

“What’s this?” he said, snatching the treasure and carrying it to the window. “Gold, good gold!” he cried. “All gold—it weighs two pounds! Ha, ha! Charles gave you that for your money, did he? Hein! Why didn’t you tell me so? It was a good bargain, little one! Yes, you are my daughter, I see that—”

Eugenie trembled in every limb.

“This came from Charles, of course, didn’t it?” continued the old man.

“Yes, father; it is not mine. It is a sacred trust.”

“Ta, ta, ta, ta! He took your fortune, and now you can get it back.”

“Father!”

Grandet took his knife to pry out some of the gold; to do this, he placed the dressing-case on a chair. Eugenie sprang forward to recover it; but her father, who had his eye on her and on the treasure too, pushed her back so violently with a thrust of his arm that she fell upon her mother’s bed.

“Monsieur, monsieur!” cried the mother, lifting herself up.

Grandet had opened his knife, and was about to apply it to the gold.

“Father!” cried Eugenie, falling on her knees and dragging herself close to him with clasped hands, “father, in the name of all the saints and the Virgin! in the name of Christ who died upon the cross! in the name of your eternal salvation, father! for my life’s sake, father! Do not touch that! It is neither yours nor mine. It is a trust placed in my hands by an unhappy relation: I must give it back to him uninjured!”

“If it is a trust, why were you looking at it? To look at it is as bad as touching it.”

“Father, don’t destroy it, or you will disgrace me! Father, do you hear?”

“Oh, have a pity!” said the mother.

“Father!” cried Eugenie in so startling a voice that Nanon ran upstairs terrified.

Eugenie sprang upon a knife that was close at hand.

“Well, what now?” said Grandet coldly, with a callous smile.

“Oh, you are killing me!” said the mother.

“Father, if your knife so much as cuts a fragment of that gold, I will stab myself with this one! You have already driven my mother to her death; you will now kill your child! Do as you choose! Wound for wound!”

Grandet held his knife over the dressing-case and hesitated as he looked at his daughter.

“Are you capable of doing it, Eugenie?” he said.

“Yes, yes!” said the mother.

“She’ll do it if she says so!” cried Nanon. “Be reasonable, monsieur, for once in your life.”

The old man looked at the gold and then at his daughter alternately for an instant. Madame Grandet fainted.

“There! don’t you see, monsieur, that madame is dying?” cried Nanon.

“Come, come, my daughter, we won’t quarrel for a box! Here, take it!” he cried hastily, flinging the case upon the bed. “Nanon, go and fetch Monsieur Bergerin! Come, mother,” said he, kissing his wife’s hand, “it’s all over! There! we’ve made up—haven’t we, little one? No more dry bread; you shall have all you want—Ah, she opens her eyes! Well, mother, little mother, come! See, I’m kissing Eugenie! She loves her cousin, and she may marry him if she wants to; she may keep his case. But don’t die, mother; live a long time yet, my poor wife! Come, try to move! Listen! you shall have the finest altar that ever was made in Saumur.”

“Oh, how can you treat your wife and daughter so!” said Madame Grandet in a feeble voice.

“I won’t do so again, never again,” cried her husband; “you shall see, my poor wife!”

He went to his inner room and returned with a handful of louis, which he scattered on the bed.

“Here, Eugenie! see, wife! all these are for you,” he said, fingering the coins. “Come, be happy, wife! feel better, get well; you sha’n’t want for anything, nor Eugenie either. Here’s a hundred louis d’or for her. You won’t give these away, will you, Eugenie, hein?”

Madame Grandet and her daughter looked at each other in astonishment.

“Take back your money, father; we ask for nothing but your affection.”

“Well, well, that’s right!” he said, pocketing the coins; “let’s be good friends! We will all go down to dinner to-day, and we’ll play loto every evening for two sous. You shall both be happy. Hey, wife?”

“Alas! I wish I could, if it would give you pleasure,” said the dying woman; “but I cannot rise from my bed.”

“Poor mother,” said Grandet, “you don’t know how I love you! and you too, my daughter!”

He took her in his arms and kissed her.

“Oh, how good it is to kiss a daughter when we have been angry with her! There, mother, don’t you see it’s all over now? Go and put that away, Eugenie,” he added, pointing to the case. “Go, don’t be afraid! I shall never speak of it again, never!”

Monsieur Bergerin, the celebrated doctor of Saumur, presently arrived. After an examination, he told Grandet positively that his wife was very ill; but that perfect peace of mind, a generous diet, and great care might prolong her life until the autumn.

“Will all that cost much?” said the old man. “Will she need medicines?”

“Not much medicine, but a great deal of care,” answered the doctor, who could scarcely restrain a smile.

“Now, Monsieur Bergerin,” said Grandet, “you are a man of honor, are not you? I trust to you! Come and see my wife how and when you think necessary. Save my good wife! I love her—don’t you see? Though I never talk about it; I keep things to myself. I’m full of trouble. Troubles began when my brother died; I have to spend enormous sums on his affairs in Paris. Why, I’m paying through my nose; there’s no end to it. Adieu, monsieur! If you can save my wife, save her. I’ll spare no expense, not even if it costs me a hundred or two hundred francs.”

In spite of Grandet’s fervent wishes for the health of his wife, whose death threatened more than death to him; in spite of the consideration he now showed on all occasions for the least wish of his astonished wife and daughter; in spite of the tender care which Eugenie lavished upon her mother—Madame Grandet rapidly approached her end. Every day she grew weaker and wasted visibly, as women of her age when attacked by serious illness are wont to do. She was fragile as the foliage in autumn; the radiance of heaven shone through her as the sun strikes athwart the withering leaves and gilds them. It was a death worthy of her life—a Christian death; and is not that sublime?

In the month of October, 1822, her virtues, her angelic patience, her love for her daughter, seemed to find special expression; and then she passed away without a murmur. Lamb without spot, she went to heaven, regretting only the sweet companion of her cold and dreary life, for whom her last glance seemed to prophesy a destiny of sorrows. She shrank from leaving her ewe-lamb, white as herself, alone in the midst of a selfish world that sought to strip her of her fleece and grasp her treasures.

“My child,” she said as she expired, “there is no happiness except in heaven; you will know it some day.”

On the morrow of this death Eugenie felt a new motive for attachment to the house in which she was born, where she had suffered so much, where her mother had just died. She could not see the window and the chair on its castors without weeping. She thought she had mistaken the heart of her old father when she found herself the object of his tenderest cares. He came in the morning and gave her his arm to take her to breakfast; he looked at her for hours together with an eye that was almost kind; he brooded over her as though she had been gold. The old man was so unlike himself, he trembled so often before his daughter, that Nanon and the Cruchotines, who witnessed his weakness, attributed it to his great age, and feared that his faculties were giving away. But the day on which the family put on their mourning, and after dinner, to which meal Maitre Cruchot (the only person who knew his secret) had been invited, the conduct of the old miser was explained.

“My dear child,” he said to Eugenie when the table had been cleared and the doors carefully shut, “you are now your mother’s heiress, and we have a few little matters to settle between us. Isn’t that so, Cruchot?”

“Yes.”

“Is it necessary to talk of them to-day, father?”

“Yes, yes, little one; I can’t bear the uncertainty in which I’m placed. I think you don’t want to give me pain?”

“Oh! Father—”

“Well, then! let us settle it all to-night.”

“What is it you wish me to do?”

“My little girl, it is not for me to say. Tell her, Cruchot.”

“Mademoiselle, your father does not wish to divide the property, nor sell the estate, nor pay enormous taxes on the ready money which he may possess. Therefore, to avoid all this, he must be released from making the inventory of his whole fortune, part of which you inherit from your mother, and which is now undivided between you and your father—”

“Cruchot, are you quite sure of what you are saying before you tell it to a mere child?”

“Let me tell it my own way, Grandet.”

“Yes, yes, my friend. Neither you nor my daughter wish to rob me—do you, little one?”

“But, Monsieur Cruchot, what am I to do?” said Eugenie impatiently.

“Well,” said the notary, “it is necessary to sign this deed, by which you renounce your rights to your mother’s estate and leave your father the use and disposition, during his lifetime, of all the property undivided between you, of which he guarantees you the capital.”

“I do not understand a word of what you are saying,” returned Eugenie; “give me the deed, and show me where I am to sign it.”

Pere Grandet looked alternately at the deed and at his daughter, at his daughter and at the deed, undergoing as he did so such violent emotion that he wiped the sweat from his brow.

“My little girl,” he said, “if, instead of signing this deed, which will cost a great deal to record, you would simply agree to renounce your rights as heir to your poor dear, deceased mother’s property, and would trust to me for the future, I should like it better. In that case I will pay you monthly the good round sum of a hundred francs. See, now, you could pay for as many masses as you want for anybody—Hein! a hundred francs a month—in livres?”

“I will do all you wish, father.”

“Mademoiselle,” said the notary, “it is my duty to point out to you that you are despoiling yourself without guarantee—”

“Good heavens! what is all that to me?”

“Hold your tongue, Cruchot! It’s settled, all settled,” cried Grandet, taking his daughter’s hand and striking it with his own.“Eugenie, you won’t go back on your word?—you are an honest girl, hein?”

“Oh! Father!—”

He kissed her effusively, and pressed her in his arms till he almost choked her.

“Go, my good child, you restore your father’s life; but you only return to him that which he gave you: we are quits. This is how business should be done. Life is a business. I bless you! you are a virtuous girl, and you love your father. Do just what you like in future. To-morrow, Cruchot,” he added, looking at the horrified notary, “you will see about preparing the deed of relinquishment, and then enter it on the records of the court.”

The next morning Eugenie signed the papers by which she herself completed her spoliation.

At the end of the first year, however, in spite of his bargain, the old man had not given his daughter one sou of the hundred francs he had so solemnly pledged to her. When Eugenie pleasantly reminded him of this, he could not help coloring, and went hastily to his secret hiding-place, from whence he brought down about a third of the jewels he had taken from his nephew, and gave them to her.

“There, little one,” he said in a sarcastic tone, “do you want those for your twelve hundred francs?”

“Oh! Father, truly? will you really give them to me?”

“I’ll give you as many more next year,” he said, throwing them into her apron. “So before long you’ll get all his gewgaws,” he added, rubbing his hands, delighted to be able to speculate on his daughter’s feelings.

Nevertheless, the old man, though still robust, felt the importance of initiating his daughter into the secrets of his thrift and its management. For two consecutive years he made her order the household meals in his presence and receive the rents, and he taught her slowly and successively the names and remunerative capacity of his vineyards and his farms. About the third year he had so thoroughly accustomed her to his avaricious methods that they had turned into the settled habits of her own life, and he was able to leave the household keys in her charge without anxiety, and to install her as mistress of the house.

Five years passed away without a single event to relieve the monotonous existence of Eugenie and her father. The same actions were performed daily with the automatic regularity of clockwork. The deep sadness of Mademoiselle Grandet was known to every one; but if others surmised the cause, she herself never uttered a word that justified the suspicions which all Saumur entertained about the state of the rich heiress’s heart. Her only society was made up of the three Cruchots and a few of their particular friends whom they had, little by little, introduced into the Grandet household. They had taught her to play whist, and they came every night for their game.

During the year 1827, her father, feeling the weight of his infirmities, was obliged to initiate her still further into the secrets of his landed property, and told her that in case of difficulty she was to have recourse to Maitre Cruchot, whose integrity was well known to him.

Towards the end of this year the old man, then eighty-two, was seized by paralysis, which made rapid progress. Dr. Bergerin gave him up. Eugenie, feeling that she was about to be left alone in the world, came, as it were, nearer to her father, and clasped more tightly this last living link of affection. To her mind, as in that of all loving women, love was the whole of life. Charles was not there, and she devoted all her care and attention to the old father, whose faculties had begun to weaken, though his avarice remained instinctively acute. The death of this man offered no contrast to his life.

In the morning he made them roll him to a spot between the chimney of his chamber and the door of the secret room, which was filled, no doubt, with gold. He asked for an explanation of every noise he heard, even the slightest; to the great astonishment of the notary, he even heard the watch-dog yawning in the court-yard. He woke up from his apparent stupor at the day and hour when the rents were due, or when accounts had to be settled with his vine-dressers,and receipts given. At such times he worked his chair forward on its castors until he faced the door of the inner room. He made his daughter open it, and watched while she placed the bags of money one upon another in his secret receptacles and relocked the door. Then she returned silently to her seat, after giving him the key, which he replaced in his waistcoat pocket and fingered from time to time. His old friend the notary, feeling sure that the rich heiress would inevitably marry his nephew the president, if Charles Grandet did not return, redoubled all his attentions; he came every day to take Grandet’s orders, went on his errands to Froidfond, to the farms and the fields and the vineyards, sold the vintages, and turned everything into gold and silver, which found their way in sacks to the secret hiding-place.

At length the last struggle came, in which the strong frame of the old man slowly yielded to destruction. He was determined to sit at the chimney-corner facing the door of the secret room. He drew off and rolled up all the coverings which were laid over him, saying to Nanon, “Put them away, lock them up, for fear they should be stolen.”

So long as he could open his eyes, in which his whole being had now taken refuge, he turned them to the door behind which lay his treasures, saying to his daughter, “Are they there? Are they there?”in a tone of voice which revealed a sort of panic fear.

“Yes, my father,” she would answer.

“Take care of the gold—put gold before me.”

Eugenie would then spread coins on a table before him, and he would sit for hours together with his eyes fixed upon them, like a child who, at the moment it first begins to see, gazes in stupid contemplation at the same object, and like the child, a distressful smile would flicker upon his face.

“It warms me!” he would sometimes say, as an expression of beatitude stole across his features.

When the cure of the parish came to administer the last sacraments, the old man’s eyes, sightless, apparently, for some hours, kindled at the sight of the cross, the candlesticks, and the holy-water vessel of silver; he gazed at them fixedly, and his wen moved for the last time. When the priest put the crucifix of silver-gilt to his lips, that he might kiss the Christ, he made a frightful gesture, as if to seize it; and that last effort cost him his life. He called Eugenie, whom he did not see, though she was kneeling beside him bathing with tears his stiffening hand, which was already cold.

“My father, bless me!” she entreated.

“Take care of it all. You will render me an account yonder!” he said, proving by these last words that Christianity must always be the religion of misers.

Eugenie Grandet was now alone in the world in that gray house, with none but Nanon to whom she could turn with the certainty of being heard and understood—Nanon the sole being who loved her for herself and with whom she could speak of her sorrows. La Grande Nanon was a providence for Eugenie. She was not a servant, but a humble friend.

After her father’s death Eugenie learned from Maitre Cruchot that she possessed an income of three hundred thousand francs from landed and personal property in the arrondissement of Saumur; also six millions invested at three per cent in the Funds (bought at sixty, and now worth seventy-six francs); also two millions in gold coin, and a hundred thousand francs in silver crown-pieces, besides all the interest which was still to be collected. The sum total of her property reached seventeen millions.

“Where is my cousin?” was her one thought.

The day on which Maitre Cruchot handed in to his client a clear and exact schedule of the whole inheritance, Eugenie remained alone with Nanon, sitting beside the fireplace in the vacant hall, where all was now a memory, from the chair on castors which her mother had sat in, to the glass from which her cousin drank.

“Nanon, we are alone—”

“Yes, mademoiselle; and if I knew where he was, the darling, I’d go on foot to find him.”

“The ocean is between us,” she said.

While the poor heiress wept in company of an old servant, in that cold dark house, which was to her the universe, the whole province rang, from Nantes to Orleans, with the seventeen millions of Mademoiselle Grandet. Among her first acts she had settled an annuity of twelve hundred francs on Nanon, who, already possessed of six hundred more, became a rich and enviable match. In less than a month that good soul passed from single to wedded life under the protection of Antoine Cornoiller, who was appointed keeper of all Mademoiselle Grandet’s estates. Madame Cornoiller possessed one striking advantage over her contemporaries. Although she was fifty-nine years of age, she did not look more than forty. Her strong features had resisted the ravages of time. Thanks to the healthy customs of her semi-conventual life, she laughed at old age from the vantage-ground of a rosy skin and an iron constitution. Perhaps she never looked as well in her life as she did on her marriage-day. She had all the benefits of her ugliness, and was big and fat and strong, with a look of happiness on her indestructible features which made a good many people envy Cornoiller.

“Fast colors!” said the draper.

“Quite likely to have children,” said the salt merchant. “She’s pickled in brine, saving your presence.”

“She is rich, and that fellow Cornoiller has done a good thing for himself,” said a third man.

When she came forth from the old house on her way to the parish church, Nanon, who was loved by all the neighborhood, received many compliments as she walked down the tortuous street.

Eugenie had given her three dozen silver forks and spoons as a wedding present. Cornoiller, amazed at such magnificence, spoke of his mistress with tears in his eyes; he would willingly have been hacked in pieces in her behalf. Madame Cornoiller, appointed housekeeper to Mademoiselle Grandet, got as much happiness out of her new position as she did from the possession of a husband. She took charge of the weekly accounts; she locked up the provisions and gave them out daily, after the manner of her defunct master; she ruled over two servants—a cook and a maid whose business it was to mend the house-linen and make mademoiselle’s dresses. Cornoiller combined the functions of keeper and bailiff. It is unnecessary to say that the women-servants selected by Nanon were “perfect treasures.”Mademoiselle Grandet thus had four servants, whose devotion was unbounded. The farmers perceived no change after Monsieur Grandet’s death; the usages and customs he had sternly established were scrupulously carried out by Monsieur and Madame Cornoiller.





VI


At thirty years of age Eugenie knew none of the joys of life. Her pale, sad childhood had glided on beside a mother whose heart, always misunderstood and wounded, had known only suffering. Leaving this life joyfully, the mother pitied the daughter because she still must live; and she left in her child’s soul some fugitive remorse and many lasting regrets. Eugenie’s first and only love was a wellspring of sadness within her. Meeting her lover for a few brief days, she had given him her heart between two kisses furtively exchanged; then he had left her, and a whole world lay between them. This love, cursed by her father, had cost the life of her mother and brought her only sorrow, mingled with a few frail hopes. Thus her upward spring towards happiness had wasted her strength and given her nothing in exchange for it. In the life of the soul, as in the physical life, there is an inspiration and a respiration; the soul needs to absorb the sentiments of another soul and assimilate them, that it may render them back enriched. Were it not for this glorious human phenomenon, there would be no life for the heart; air would be wanting; it would suffer, and then perish.

Eugenie had begun to suffer. For her, wealth was neither a power nor a consolation; she could not live except through love, through religion, through faith in the future. Love explained to her the mysteries of eternity. Her heart and the Gospel taught her to know two worlds; she bathed, night and day, in the depths of two infinite thoughts, which for her may have had but one meaning. She drew back within herself, loving, and believing herself beloved.For seven years her passion had invaded everything. Her treasuries were not the millions whose revenues were rolling up; they were Charles’s dressing-case, the portraits hanging above her bed, the jewels recovered from her father and proudly spread upon a bed of wool in a drawer of the oaken cabinet, the thimble of her aunt, used for a while by her mother, which she wore religiously as she worked at a piece of embroidery—a Penelope’s web, begun for the sole purpose of putting upon her finger that gold so rich in memories.

It seemed unlikely that Mademoiselle Grandet would marry during the period of her mourning. Her genuine piety was well known. Consequently the Cruchots, whose policy was sagely guided by the old abbe, contented themselves for the time being with surrounding the great heiress and paying her the most affectionate attentions.

Every evening the hall was filled with a party of devoted Cruchotines, who sang the praises of its mistress in every key. She had her doctor in ordinary, her grand almoner, her chamberlain, her first lady of honor, her prime minister; above all, her chancellor, a chancellor who would fain have said much to her. If the heiress had wished for a train-bearer, one would instantly have been found. She was a queen, obsequiously flattered. Flattery never emanates from noble souls; it is the gift of little minds, who thus still further belittle themselves to worm their way into the vital being of the persons around whom they crawl. Flattery means self-interest. So the people who, night after night, assembled in Mademoiselle Grandet’s house (they called her Mademoiselle de Froidfond) outdid each other in expressions of admiration. This concert of praise, never before bestowed upon Eugenie, made her blush under its novelty; but insensibly her ear became habituated to the sound, and however coarse the compliments might be, she soon was so accustomed to hear her beauty lauded that if any new-comer had seemed to think her plain, she would have felt the reproach far more than she might have done eight years earlier. She ended at last by loving the incense,which she secretly laid at the feet of her idol. By degrees she grew accustomed to be treated as a sovereign and to see her court pressing around her every evening.

Monsieur de Bonfons was the hero of the little circle, where his wit, his person, his education, his amiability, were perpetually praised. One or another would remark that in seven years he had largely increased his fortune, that Bonfons brought in at least ten thousand francs a year, and was surrounded, like the other possessions of the Cruchots, by the vast domains of the heiress.

“Do you know, mademoiselle,” said an habitual visitor, “that the Cruchots have an income of forty thousand francs among them!”

“And then, their savings!” exclaimed an elderly female Cruchotine, Mademoiselle de Gribeaucourt. “A gentleman from Paris has lately offered Monsieur Cruchot two hundred thousand francs for his practice,” said another. “He will sell it if he is appointed juge de paix.”

“He wants to succeed Monsieur de Bonfons as president of the Civil courts, and is taking measures,” replied Madame d’Orsonval.“Monsieur le president will certainly be made councillor.”

“Yes, he is a very distinguished man,” said another, “don’t you think so, mademoiselle?”

Monsieur de Bonfons endeavored to put himself in keeping with the role he sought to play. In spite of his forty years, in spite of his dusky and crabbed features, withered like most judicial faces, he dressed in youthful fashions, toyed with a bamboo cane, never took snuff in Mademoiselle de Froidfond’s house, and came in a white cravat and a shirt whose pleated frill gave him a family resemblance to the race of turkeys. He addressed the beautiful heiress familiarly, and spoke of her as “Our dear Eugenie.”

In short, except for the number of visitors, the change from loto to whist, and the disappearance of Monsieur and Madame Grandet, the scene was about the same as the one with which this history opened. The pack were still pursuing Eugenie and her millions; but the hounds, more in number, lay better on the scent, and beset the prey more unitedly. If Charles could have dropped from the Indian Isles, he would have found the same people and the same interests. Madame des Grassins, to whom Eugenie was full of kindness and courtesy, still persisted in tormenting the Cruchots. Eugenie, as in former days, was the central figure of the picture; and Charles, as heretofore, would still have been the sovereign of all. Yet there had been some progress. The flowers which the president formerly presented to Eugenie on her birthdays and fete-days had now become a daily institution. Every evening he brought the rich heiress a huge and magnificent bouquet, which Madame Cornoiller placed conspicuously in a vase, and secretly threw into a corner of the court-yard when the visitors had departed.

Early in the spring, Madame des Grassins attempted to trouble the peace of the Cruchotines by talking to Eugenie of the Marquis de Froidfond, whose ancient and ruined family might be restored if the heiress would give him back his estates through marriage. Madame des Grassins rang the changes on the peerage and the title of marquise, until, mistaking Eugenie’s disdainful smile for acquiescence, she went about proclaiming that the marriage with“Monsieur Cruchot” was not nearly as certain as people thought.

“Though Monsieur de Froidfond is fifty,” she said, “he does not look older than Monsieur Cruchot. He is a widower, and he has children, that’s true. But then he is a marquis; he will be peer of France; and in times like these where you will find a better match? I know it for a fact that Pere Grandet, when he put all his money into Froidfond, intended to graft himself upon that stock; he often told me so. He was a deep one, that old man!”

“Ah! Nanon,” said Eugenie, one night as she was going to bed,“how is it that in seven years he has never once written to me?”

While these events were happening in Saumur, Charles was making his fortune in the Indies. His commercial outfit had sold well. He began by realizing a sum of six thousand dollars. Crossing the line had brushed a good many cobwebs out of his brain; he perceived that the best means of attaining fortune in tropical regions, as well as in Europe, was to buy and sell men. He went to the coast of Africa and bought Negroes, combining his traffic in human flesh with that of other merchandise equally advantageous to his interests. He carried into this business an activity which left him not a moment of leisure. He was governed by the desire of reappearing in Paris with all the prestige of a large fortune, and by the hope of regaining a position even more brilliant than the one from which he had fallen.

By dint of jostling with men, travelling through many lands, and studying a variety of conflicting customs, his ideas had been modified and had become sceptical. He ceased to have fixed principles of right and wrong, for he saw what was called a crime in one country lauded as a virtue in another. In the perpetual struggle of selfish interests his heart grew cold, then contracted, and then dried up. The blood of the Grandets did not fail of its destiny; Charles became hard, and eager for prey. He sold Chinamen, Negroes, birds’ nests, children, artists; he practised usury on a large scale; the habit of defrauding custom-houses soon made him less scrupulous about the rights of his fellow men. He went to the Island of St. Thomas and bought, for a mere song, merchandise that had been captured by pirates, and took it to ports where he could sell it at a good price.

If the pure and noble face of Eugenie went with him on his first voyage, like that image of the Virgin which Spanish mariners fastened to their masts, if he attributed his first success to the magic influence of the prayers and intercessions of his gentle love, later on women of other kinds—blacks, mulattoes, whites, and Indian dancing-girls—orgies and adventures in many lands, completely effaced all recollection of his cousin, of Saumur, of the house, the bench, the kiss snatched in the dark passage. He remembered only the little garden shut in with crumbling walls, for it was there he learned the fate that had overtaken him; but he rejected all connection with his family. His uncle was an old dog who had filched his jewels; Eugenie had no place in his heart nor in his thoughts, though she did have a place in his accounts as a creditor for the sum of six thousand francs. Such conduct and such ideas explain Charles Grandet’s silence. In the Indies, at St. Thomas, on the coast of Africa, at Lisbon, and in the United States the adventurer had taken the pseudonym of Shepherd, that he might not compromise his own name. Charles Shepherd could safely be indefatigable, bold, grasping, and greedy of gain, like a man who resolves to snatch his fortune quibus cumque viis, and makes haste to have done with villany, that he may spend the rest of his life as an honest man. With such methods, prosperity was rapid and brilliant;and in 1827 Charles Grandet returned to Bordeaux on the “Marie Caroline,” a fine brig belonging to a royalist house of business. He brought with him nineteen hundred thousand francs worth of gold-dust, from which he expected to derive seven or eight per cent more at the Paris mint. On the brig he met a gentleman-in-ordinary to His Majesty Charles X., Monsieur d’Aubrion, a worthy old man who had committed the folly of marrying a woman of fashion with a fortune derived from the West India Islands. To meet the costs of Madame d’Aubrion’s extravagance, he had gone out to the Indies to sell the property, and was now returning with his family to France. Monsieur and Madame d’Aubrion, of the house of d’Aubrion de Buch, a family of southern France, whose last captal, or chief, died before 1789, were now reduced to an income of about twenty thousand francs, and they possessed an ugly daughter whom the mother was resolved to marry without adot—the family fortune being scarcely sufficient for the demands of her own life in Paris. This was an enterprise whose success might have seemed problematical to most men of the world, in spite of the cleverness with which such men credit a fashionable woman; in fact, Madame d’Aubrion herself, when she looked at her daughter, almost despaired of getting rid of her to any one, even to a man craving connection with nobility.

Mademoiselle d’Aubrion was a long, spare, spindling demoiselle, like her namesake the insect; her mouth was disdainful;over it hung a nose that was too long, thick at the end, sallow in its normal condition, but very red after a meal—a sort of vegetable phenomenon which is particularly disagreeable when it appears in the middle of a pale, dull, and uninteresting face. In one sense she was all that a worldly mother, thirty-eight years of age and still a beauty with claims to admiration, could have wished. However, to counterbalance her personal defects, the marquise gave her daughter a distinguished air, subjected her to hygienic treatment which provisionally kept her nose at a reasonable flesh-tint, taught her the art of dressing well, endowed her with charming manners, showed her the trick of melancholy glances which interest a man and make him believe that he has found a long-sought angel, taught her the manoeuvre of the foot—letting it peep beneath the petticoat, to show its tiny size, at the moment when the nose became aggressively red;in short, Madame d’Aubrion had cleverly made the very best of her offspring. By means of full sleeves, deceptive pads, puffed dresses amply trimmed, and high-pressure corsets, she had obtained such curious feminine developments that she ought, for the instruction of mothers, to have exhibited them in a museum. Charles became very intimate with Madame d’Aubrion precisely because she was desirous of becoming intimate with him. Persons who were on board the brig declared that the handsome Madame d’Aubrion neglected no means of capturing so rich a son-in-law. On landing at Bordeaux in June, 1827, Monsieur, Madame, Mademoiselle d’Aubrion, and Charles lodged at the same hotel and started together for Paris. The hotel d’Aubrion was hampered with mortgages; Charles was destined to free it. The mother told him how delighted she would be to give up the ground-floor to a son-in-law. Not sharing Monsieur d’Aubrion’s prejudices on the score of nobility, she promised Charles Grandet to obtain a royal ordinance from Charles X. which would authorize him, Grandet, to take the name and arms of d’Aubrion and to succeed, by purchasing the entailed estate for thirty-six thousand francs a year, to the titles of Captal de Buch and Marquis d’Aubrion. By thus uniting their fortunes, living on good terms, and profiting by sinecures, the two families might occupy the hotel d’Aubrion with an income of over a hundred thousand francs.

“And when a man has a hundred thousand francs a year, a name, a family, and a position at court—for I will get you appointed as gentleman-of-the-bedchamber—he can do what he likes,” she said to Charles. “You can then become anything you choose—master of the rolls in the council of State, prefect, secretary to an embassy, the ambassador himself, if you like. Charles X. is fond of d’Aubrion;they have known each other from childhood.”

Intoxicated with ambition, Charles toyed with the hopes thus cleverly presented to him in the guise of confidences poured from heart to heart. Believing his father’s affairs to have been settled by his uncle, he imagined himself suddenly anchored in the Faubourg Saint-Germain—that social object of all desire, where, under shelter of Mademoiselle Mathilde’s purple nose, he was to reappear as the Comte d’Aubrion, very much as the Dreux reappeared in Breze. Dazzled by the prosperity of the Restoration, which was tottering when he left France, fascinated by the splendor of aristocratic ideas, his intoxication, which began on the brig, increased after he reached Paris, and he finally determined to take the course and reach the high position which the selfish hopes of his would-be mother-in-law pointed out to him. His cousin counted for no more than a speck in this brilliant perspective; but he went to see Annette.

True woman of the world, Annette advised her old friend to make the marriage, and promised him her support in all his ambitious projects. In her heart she was enchanted to fasten an ugly and uninteresting girl on Charles, whose life in the West Indies had rendered him very attractive. His complexion had bronzed, his manners had grown decided and bold, like those of a man accustomed to make sharp decisions, to rule, and to succeed. Charles breathed more at his ease in Paris, conscious that he now had a part to play.

Des Grassins, hearing of his return, of his approaching marriage and his large fortune, came to see him, and inquired about the three hundred thousand francs still required to settle his father’s debts.

He found Grandet in conference with a goldsmith, from whom he had ordered jewels for Mademoiselle d’Aubrion’s corbeille, and who was then submitting the designs. Charles had brought back magnificent diamonds, and the value of their setting, together with the plate and jewelry of the new establishment, amounted to more than two hundred thousand francs. He received des Grassins, whom he did not recognize, with the impertinence of a young man of fashion conscious of having killed four men in as many duels in the Indies. Monsieur des Grassins had already called several times. Charles listened to him coldly, and then replied, without fully understanding what had been said to him—

“My father’s affairs are not mine. I am much obliged, monsieur, for the trouble you have been good enough to take—by which, however, I really cannot profit. I have not earned two millions by the sweat of my brow to fling them at the head of my father’s creditors.”

“But suppose that your father’s estate were within a few days to be declared bankrupt?”

“Monsieur, in a few days I shall be called the Comte d’Aubrion;you will understand, therefore, that what you threaten is of no consequence to me. Besides, you know as well as I do that when a man has an income of a hundred thousand francs his father has never failed.” So saying, he politely edged Monsieur des Grassins to the door.

At the beginning of August in the same year, Eugenie was sitting on the little wooden bench where her cousin had sworn to love her eternally, and where she usually breakfasted if the weather were fine. The poor girl was happy, for the moment, in the fresh and joyous summer air, letting her memory recall the great and the little events of her love and the catastrophes which had followed it. The sun had just reached the angle of the ruined wall, so full of chinks, which no one, through a caprice of the mistress, was allowed to touch, though Cornoiller often remarked to his wife that “it would fall and crush somebody one of these days.” At this moment the postman knocked, and gave a letter to Madame Cornoiller, who ran into the garden, crying out—

“Mademoiselle, a letter!” She gave it to her mistress, adding, “Is it the one you expected?”

The words rang as loudly in the heart of Eugenie as they echoed in sound from wall to wall of the court and garden.

“Paris—from him—he has returned!”

Eugenie turned pale and held the letter for a moment. She trembled so violently that she could not break the seal.

La Grande Nanon stood before her, both hands on her hips, her joy puffing as it were like smoke through the cracks of her brown face.

“Read it, mademoiselle!”

“Ah, Nanon, why did he return to Paris? He went from Saumur.”

“Read it, and you’ll find out.”

Eugenie opened the letter with trembling fingers. A cheque on the house of “Madame des Grassins and Coret, of Saumur,” fluttered down. Nanon picked it up.

My dear Cousin—

“No longer ‘Eugenie,’” she thought, and her heart quailed.

You—

“He once said ‘thou.’” She folded her arms and dared not read another word; great tears gathered in her eyes.

“Is he dead?” asked Nanon.

“If he were, he could not write,” said Eugenie.

She then read the whole letter, which was as follows:

My dear Cousin—You will, I am sure, hear with pleasure of the success of my enterprise. You brought me luck; I have come back rich, and I have followed the advice of my uncle, whose death, together with that of my aunt, I have just learned from Monsieur des Grassins. The death of parents is in the course of nature, and we must succeed them. I trust you are by this time consoled. Nothing can resist time, as I am well aware. Yes, my dear cousin,the day of illusions is, unfortunately, gone for me. How could it be otherwise? Travelling through many lands, I have reflected upon life. I was a child when I went away—I have come back a man. To-day, I think of many I did not dream of then. You are free, my dear cousin, and I am free still. Nothing apparently hinders the realization of our early hopes; but my nature is too loyal to hide from you the situation in which I find myself. I have not forgotten our relations; I have always remembered, throughout my long wanderings, the little wooden seat—

Eugenie rose as if she were sitting on live coals, and went away and sat down on the stone steps of the court.

—the little wooden seat where we vowed to love each other forever, the passage, the gray hall, my attic chamber, and the night when, by your delicate kindness, you made my future easier to me. Yes, these recollections sustained my courage; I said in my heart that you were thinking of me at the hour we had agreed upon. Have you always looked at the clouds at nine o’clock? Yes, I am sure of it. I cannot betray so true a friendship—no, I must not deceive you. An alliance has been proposed to me which satisfies all my ideas of matrimony. Love in marriage is a delusion. My present experience warns me that in marrying we are bound to obey all social laws and meet the conventional demands of the world. Now, between you and me there are differences which might affect your future, my dear cousin, even more than they would mine. I will not here speak of your customs and inclinations, your education, nor yet of your habits, none of which are in keeping with Parisian life, or with the future which I have marked out for myself. My intention is to keep my household on a stately footing, to receive much company—in short, to live in the world; and I think I remember that you love a quiet and tranquil life. I will be frank, and make you the judge of my situation; you have the right to understand it and to judge it. I possess at the present moment an income of eighty thousand francs. This fortune enables me to marry into the family of Aubrion, whose heiress, a young girl nineteen years of age, brings me a title, a place of gentleman-of-the-bed-chamber to His Majesty, and a very brilliant position. I will admit to you, my dear cousin, that I do not love Mademoiselle d’Aubrion; but in marrying her I secure to my children a social rank whose advantages will one day be incalculable: monarchical principles are daily coming more and more into favor. Thus in course of time my son, when he becomes Marquis d’Aubrion, having, as he then will have, an entailed estate with a rental of forty thousand francs a year, can obtain any position in the State which he may think proper to select. We owe ourselves to our children. You see, my cousin, with what good faith I lay the state of my heart, my hopes, and my fortune before you. Possibly, after seven years’ separation, you have yourself forgotten our youthful loves; but I have never forgotten either your kindness or my own words. I remember all, even words that were lightly uttered—words by which a man less conscientious than I, with a heart less youthful and less upright, would scarcely feel himself bound. In telling you that the marriage I propose to make is solely one of convenience, that I still remember our childish love, am I not putting myself entirely in your hands and making you the mistress of my fate? Am I not telling you that if I must renounce my social ambitions, I shall willingly content myself with the pure and simple happiness of which you have shown me so sweet an image?

Your devoted cousin, Charles.

“Tan, ta, ta—tan, ta, ti,” sang Charles Grandet to the air of Non piu andrai, as he signed himself—

“Thunder! That’s doing it handsomely!” he said, as he looked about him for the cheque; having found it, he added the words—

P.S.—I enclose a cheque on the des Grassins bank for eight thousand francs to your order, payable in gold, which includes the capital and interest of the sum you were kind enough to lend me. I am expecting a case from Bordeaux which contains a few things which you must allow me to offer you as a mark of my unceasing gratitude. You can send my dressing-case by the diligence to the hotel d’Aubrion, rue Hillerin-Bertin.

“By the diligence!” said Eugenie. “A thing for which I would have laid down my life!”

Terrible and utter disaster! The ship went down, leaving not a spar, not a plank, on a vast ocean of hope!

Some women when they see themselves abandoned will try to tear their lover from the arms of a rival, they will kill her, and rush to the ends of the earth—to the scaffold, to their tomb. That, no doubt, is fine; the motive of the crime is a great passion, which awes even human justice. Other women bow their heads and suffer in silence;they go their way dying, resigned, weeping, forgiving, praying, and recollecting, till they draw their last breath. This is love—true love, the love of angels, the proud love which lives upon its anguish and dies of it. Such was Eugenie’s love after she had read that dreadful letter. She raised her eyes to heaven, thinking of the last words uttered by her dying mother, who, with the prescience of death, had looked into the future with clear and penetrating eyes: Eugenie, remembering that prophetic death, that prophetic life, measured with one glance her own destiny. Nothing was left for her; she could only unfold her wings, stretch upward to the skies, and live in prayer until the day of her deliverance.

“My mother was right,” she said, weeping. “Suffer—and die!”

Eugenie came slowly back from the garden to the house, and avoided passing, as was her custom, through the corridor. But the memory of her cousin was in the gray old hall and on the chimney-piece, where stood a certain saucer and the old Sevres sugar-bowl which she used every morning at her breakfast. This day was destined to be solemn throughout and full of events. Nanon announced the cure of the parish church. He was related to the Cruchots, and therefore in the interests of Monsieur de Bonfons. For some time past the old abbe had urged him to speak to Mademoiselle Grandet, from a purely religious point of view, about the duty of marriage for a woman in her position. When she saw her pastor, Eugenie supposed he had come for the thousand francs which she gave monthly to the poor, and she told Nanon to go and fetch them;but the cure only smiled.

“To-day, mademoiselle,” he said, “I have come to speak to you about a poor girl in whom the whole town of Saumur takes an interest, who, through lack of charity to herself, neglects her Christian duties.”

“Monsieur le cure, you have come to me at a moment when I cannot think of my neighbor, I am filled with thoughts of myself. I am very unhappy; my only refuge is in the Church; her bosom is large enough to hold all human woe, her love so full that we may draw from its depths and never drain it dry.”

“Mademoiselle, in speaking of this young girl we shall speak of you. Listen! If you wish to insure your salvation you have only two paths to take—either leave the world or obey its laws. Obey either your earthly destiny or your heavenly destiny.”

“Ah! your voice speaks to me when I need to hear a voice. Yes, God has sent you to me; I will bid farewell to the world and live for God alone, in silence and seclusion.”

“My daughter, you must think long before you take so violent a step. Marriage is life, the veil is death.”

“Yes, death—a quick death!” she said, with dreadful eagerness.

“Death? but you have great obligations to fulfil to society, mademoiselle. Are you not the mother of the poor, to whom you give clothes and wood in winter and work in summer? Your great fortune is a loan which you must return, and you have sacredly accepted it as such. To bury yourself in a convent would be selfishness; to remain an old maid is to fail in duty. In the first place, can you manage your vast property alone? May you not lose it? You will have law-suits, you will find yourself surrounded by inextricable difficulties. Believe your pastor: a husband is useful; you are bound to preserve what God has bestowed upon you. I speak to you as a precious lamb of my flock. You love God too truly not to find your salvation in the midst of his world, of which you are noble ornament and to which you owe your example.”

At this moment Madame des Grassins was announced. She came incited by vengeance and the sense of a great despair.

“Mademoiselle,” she said—”Ah! here is monsieur le cure; I am silent. I came to speak to you on business; but I see that you are conferring with—”

“Madame,” said the cure, “I leave the field to you.”

“Oh! monsieur le cure,” said Eugenie, “come back later; your support is very necessary to me just now.”

“Ah, yes, indeed, my poor child!” said Madame des Grassins.

“What do you mean?” asked Eugenie and the cure together.

“Don’t I know about your cousin’s return, and his marriage with Mademoiselle d’Aubrion? A woman doesn’t carry her wits in her pocket.”

Eugenie blushed, and remained silent for a moment. From this day forth she assumed the impassible countenance for which her father had been so remarkable.

“Well, madame,” she presently said, ironically, “no doubt I carry my wits in my pocket, for I do not understand you. Speak, say what you mean, before monsieur le cure; you know he is my director.”

“Well, then, mademoiselle, here is what des Grassins writes me. Read it.”

Eugenie read the following letter—

My dear Wife—Charles Grandet has returned from the Indies and has been in Paris about a month—

“A month!” thought Eugenie, her hand falling to her side. After a pause she resumed the letter—

I had to dance attendance before I was allowed to see the future Vicomte d’Aubrion. Though all Paris is talking of his marriage and the banns are published—

“He wrote to me after that!” thought Eugenie. She did not conclude the thought; she did not cry out, as a Parisian woman would have done, “The villain!” but though she said it not, contempt was none the less present in her mind.

The marriage, however, will not come off. The Marquis d’Aubrion will never give his daughter to the son of a bankrupt. I went to tell Grandet of the steps his uncle and I took in his father’s

business, and the clever manoeuvres by which we had managed to keep the creditor’s quiet until the present time. The insolent fellow had the face to say to me—to me, who for five years have devoted myself night and day to his interests and his honor—that his father’s affairs were not his! A solicitor would have had the right to demand fees amounting to thirty or forty thousand francs, one per cent on the total of the debts. But patience! there are twelve hundred thousand francs legitimately owing to the creditors, and I shall at once declare his father a bankrupt. I went into this business on the word of that old crocodile Grandet, and I have made promises in the name of his family. If Monsieur de vicomte d’Aubrion does not care for his honor, I care for mine. I shall explain my position to the creditors. Still, I have too much respect for Mademoiselle Eugenie (to whom under happier circumstances we once hoped to be allied) to act in this matter before you have spoken to her about it—

There Eugenie paused, and coldly returned the letter without finishing it.

“I thank you,” she said to Madame des Grassins.

“Ah! you have the voice and manner of your deceased father,”Madame des Grassins replied.

“Madame, you have eight thousand francs to pay us,” said Nanon, producing Charles’s cheque.

“That’s true; have the kindness to come with me now, Madame Cornoiller.”

“Monsieur le cure,” said Eugenie with a noble composure, inspired by the thought she was about to express, “would it be a sin to remain a virgin after marriage?”

“That is a case of conscience whose solution is not within my knowledge. If you wish to know what the celebrated Sanchez says of it in his treatise ‘De Matrimonio,’ I shall be able to tell you to-morrow.”

The cure went away; Mademoiselle Grandet went up to her father’s secret room and spent the day there alone, without coming down to dinner, in spite of Nanon’s entreaties. She appeared in the evening at the hour when the usual company began to arrive. Never was the old hall so full as on this occasion. The news of Charles’s return and his foolish treachery had spread through the whole town. But however watchful the curiosity of the visitors might be, it was left unsatisfied. Eugenie, who expected scrutiny, allowed none of the cruel emotions that wrung her soul to appear on the calm surface of her face. She was able to show a smiling front in answer to all who tried to testify their interest by mournful looks or melancholy speeches. She hid her misery behind a veil of courtesy.

Towards nine o’clock the games ended and the players left the tables, paying their losses and discussing points of the game as they joined the rest of the company. At the moment when the whole party rose to take leave, an unexpected and striking event occurred, which resounded through the length and breadth of Saumur, from thence through the arrondissement, and even to the four surrounding prefectures.

“Stay, monsieur le president,” said Eugenie to Monsieur de Bonfons as she saw him take his cane.

There was not a person in that numerous assembly who was unmoved by these words. The president turned pale, and was forced to sit down.

“The president gets the millions,” said Mademoiselle de Gribeaucourt.

“It is plain enough; the president marries Mademoiselle Grandet,” cried Madame d’Orsonval.

“All the trumps in one hand,” said the abbe.

“A love game,” said the notary.

Each and all said his say, made his pun, and looked at the heiress mounted on her millions as on a pedestal. The drama begun nine years before had reached its conclusion. To tell the president, in face of all Saumur, to “stay,” was surely the same thing as proclaiming him her husband. In provincial towns social conventionalities are so rigidly enforced than an infraction like this constituted a solemn promise.

“Monsieur le president,” said Eugenie in a voice of some emotion when they were left alone, “I know what pleases you in me. Swear to leave me free during my whole life, to claim none of the rights which marriage will give you over me, and my hand is yours. Oh!” she added, seeing him about to kneel at her feet, “I have more to say. I must not deceive you. In my heart I cherish one inextinguishable feeling. Friendship is the only sentiment which I can give to a husband. I wish neither to affront him nor to violate the laws of my own heart. But you can possess my hand and my fortune only at the cost of doing me an inestimable service.”

“I am ready for all things,” said the president.

“Here are fifteen hundred thousand francs,” she said, drawing from her bosom a certificate of a hundred shares in the Bank of France. “Go to Paris—not to-morrow, but instantly. Find Monsieur des Grassins, learn the names of my uncle’s creditors, call them together, pay them in full all that was owing, with interest at five per cent from the day the debt was incurred to the present time. Be careful to obtain a full and legal receipt, in proper form, before a notary. You are a magistrate, and I can trust this matter in your hands. You are a man of honor; I will put faith in your word, and meet the dangers of life under shelter of your name. Let us have mutual indulgence. We have known each other so long that we are almost related; you would not wish to render me unhappy.”

The president fell at the feet of the rich heiress, his heart beating and wrung with joy.

“I will be your slave!” he said.

“When you obtain the receipts, monsieur,” she resumed, with a cold glance, “you will take them with all the other papers to my cousin Grandet, and you will give him this letter. On your return I will keep my word.”

The president understood perfectly that he owed the acquiescence of Mademoiselle Grandet to some bitterness of love, and he made haste to obey her orders, lest time should effect a reconciliation between the pair.

When Monsieur de Bonfons left her, Eugenie fell back in her chair and burst into tears. All was over. The president took the mail-post, and reached Paris the next evening. The morning after his arrival he went to see des Grassins, and together they summoned the creditors to meet at the notary’s office where the vouchers had been deposited. Not a single creditor failed to be present. Creditors though they were, justice must be done to them—they were all punctual. Monsieur de Bonfons, in the name of Mademoiselle Grandet, paid them the amount of their claims with interest. The payment of interest was a remarkable event in the Parisian commerce of that day.

When the receipts were all legally registered, and des Grassins had received for his services the sum of fifty thousand francs allowed to him by Eugenie, the president made his way to the hotel d’Aubrion and found Charles just entering his own apartment after a serious encounter with his prospective father-in-law. The old marquis had told him plainly that he should not marry his daughter until all the creditors of Guillaume Grandet had been paid in full.

The president gave Charles the following letter—

My Cousin—Monsieur le president de Bonfons has undertaken to place in your hands the aquittance for all claims upon my uncle,also a receipt by which I acknowledge having received from you the sum total of those claims. I have heard of a possible failure, and I think that the son of a bankrupt may not be able to marry Mademoiselle d’Aubrion. Yes, my cousin, you judged rightly of my mind and of my manners. I have, it is true, no part in the world;I understand neither its calculations nor its customs; and I could not give you the pleasures that you seek in it. Be happy, according to the social conventions to which you have sacrificed our love. To make your happiness complete I can only offer you your father’s honor. Adieu! You will always have a faithful friend in your cousin .

Eugenie

The president smiled at the exclamation which the ambitious young man could not repress as he received the documents.

“We shall announce our marriages at the same time,” remarked Monsieur de Bonfons.

“Ah! You marry Eugenie? Well, I am delighted; she is a good girl. But,” added Charles, struck with a luminous idea, “she must be rich?”

“She had,” said the president, with a mischievous smile, “about nineteen millions four days ago; but she has only seventeen millions to-day.”

Charles looked at him thunderstruck.

“Seventeen mil—”

“Seventeen millions; yes, monsieur. We shall muster, Made-moiselle Grandet and I, an income of seven hundred and fifty thousand francs when we marry.”

“My dear cousin,” said Charles, recovering a little of his assurance,“we can push each other’s fortunes.”

“Agreed,” said the president. “Here is also a little case which I am charged to give into your own hands,” he added, placing on the table the leather box which contained the dressing-case.

“Well, my dear friend,” said Madame d’Aubrion, entering the room without noticing the president, “don’t pay any attention to what poor Monsieur d’Aubrion has just said to you; the Duchesse de Chaulieu has turned his head. I repeat, nothing shall interfere with the marriage—”

“Very good, madame. The three millions which my father owed were paid yesterday.”

“In money?” she asked.

“Yes, in full, capital and interest; and I am about to do honor to his memory—”

“What folly!” exclaimed his mother-in-law. “Who is this?” she whispered in Grandet’s ear, perceiving the president.

“My man of business,” he answered in a low voice.

The marquise bowed superciliously to Monsieur de Bonfons.

“We are pushing each other’s fortunes already,” said the president, taking up his hat. “Good-bye, cousin.”

“He is laughing at me, the old cockatoo! I’d like to put six inches of iron into him!” muttered Charles.

The president was out of hearing. Three days later Monsieur de Bonfons, on his return to Saumur, announced his marriage with Eugenie. Six months after the marriage he was appointed councillor in the Cour royale at Angers.

Before leaving Saumur Madame de Bonfons had the gold of certain jewels, once so precious to her, melted up, and put, together with the eight thousand francs paid back by her cousin, into a golden pyx, which she gave to the parish church where she had so long prayed for him.

She now spent her time between Angers and Saumur. Her husband, who had shown some public spirit on a certain occasion, became a judge in the superior courts, and finally, after a few years, president of them. He was anxiously awaiting a general election, in the hope of being returned to the Chamber of deputies. He hankered after a peerage; and then—

“The king will be his cousin, won’t he?” said Nanon, la Grande Nanon, Madame Cornoiller, bourgeoise of Saumur, as she listened to her mistress, who was recounting the honors to which she was called.





VII


Nevertheless, Monsieur de Bonfons (he had finally abolished his patronymic of Cruchot) did not realize any of his ambitious ideas. He died eight days after his election as deputy of Saumur.

God, who sees all and never strikes amiss, punished him, no doubt, for his sordid calculations and the legal cleverness with which, accurante Cruchot, he had drawn up his marriage contract, in which husband and wife gave to each other, “in case they should have no children, their entire property of every kind, landed or otherwise, without exception or reservation, dispensing even with the formality of an inventory; provided that said omission of said inventory shall not injure their heirs and assigns, it being understood that this deed of gift is, etc., etc.” This clause of the contract will explain the profound respect which monsieur le president always testified for the wishes, and above all, for the solitude of Madame de Bonfons. Women cited him as the most considerate and delicate of men, pitied him, and even went so far as to find fault with the passion and grief of Eugenie, blaming her, as women know so well how to blame, with cruel but discreet insinuation.

“Madame de Bonfons must be very ill to leave her husband entirely alone. Poor woman! Is she likely to get well? What is it? Something gastric? A cancer?”—“She has grown perfectly yellow. She ought to consult some celebrated doctor in Paris.”—“How can she be happy without a child? They say she loves her husband;then why not give him an heir? In his position, too!”—“Do you know, it is really dreadful! If it is the result of mere caprice, it is unpardonable. Poor president!”

Endowed with the delicate perception which a solitary soul acquires through constant meditation, through the exquisite clear-sightedness with which a mind aloof from life fastens on all that falls within its sphere, Eugenie, taught by suffering and by her later education to divine thought, knew well that the president desired her death that he might step into possession of their immense fortune, augmented by the property of his uncle the notary and his uncle the abbe, whom it had lately pleased God to call to himself. The poor solitary pitied the president. Providence avenged her for the calculations and the indifference of a husband who respected the hopeless passion on which she spent her life because it was his surest safeguard. To give life to a child would give death to his hopes—the hopes of selfishness, the joys of ambition, which the president cherished as he looked into the future.

God thus flung piles of gold upon this prisoner to whom gold was a matter of indifference, who longed for heaven, who lived, pious and good, in holy thoughts, succoring the unfortunate in secret, and never wearying of such deeds.

Madame de Bonfons became a widow at thirty-six. She is still beautiful, but with the beauty of a woman who is nearly forty years of age. Her face is white and placid and calm; her voice gentle and self-possessed; her manners are simple. She has the noblest qualities of sorrow, the saintliness of one who has never soiled her soul by contact with the world; but she has also the rigid bearing of an old maid and the petty habits inseparable from the narrow round of provincial life. In spite of her vast wealth, she lives as the poor Eugenie Grandet once lived. The fire is never lighted on her hearth until the day when her father allowed it to be lighted in the hall, and it is put out in conformity with the rules which governed her youthful years. She dresses as her mother dressed. The house in Saumur, without sun, without warmth, always in shadow, melancholy, is an image of her life. She carefully accumulates her income, and might seem parsimonious did she not disarm criticism by a noble employment of her wealth. Pious and charitable institutions, a hospital for old age, Christian schools for children, a public library richly endowed, bear testimony against the charge of avarice which some persons lay at her door. The churches of Saumur owe much of their embellishment to her. Madame de Bonfons (sometimes ironically spoken of as mademoiselle) inspires for the most part reverential respect: and yet that noble heart, beating only with tenderest emotions, has been, from first to last, subjected to the calculations of human selfishness; money has cast its frigid influence upon that hallowed life and taught distrust of feelings to a woman who is all feeling.

“I have none but you to love me,” she says to Nanon.

The hand of this woman stanches the secret wounds in many families. She goes on her way to heaven attended by a train of benefactions. The grandeur of her soul redeems the narrowness of her education and the petty habits of her early life.

Such is the history of Eugenie Grandet, who is in the world but not of it; who, created to be supremely a wife and mother, has neither husband nor children nor family.

Lately there has been some question of her marrying again. The Saumur people talk of her and of the Marquis de Froidfond, whose family are beginning to beset the rich widow just as, in former days, the Cruchots laid siege to the rich heiress.

Nanon and Cornoiller are, it is said, in the interests of the marquis. Nothing could be more false. Neither la Grande Nanon nor Cornoiller has sufficient mind to understand the corruptions of the world.
