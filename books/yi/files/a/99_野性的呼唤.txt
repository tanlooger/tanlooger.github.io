杰克·伦敦（Jack London，1876—1916）原名约翰·格利菲斯·伦敦（John Griffith London），生于美国旧金山，大约是一个占星术家的私生子，在一个既无固定职业亦无固定住所的家庭里长大。他十四岁小学毕业后在旧金山和奥克兰一带以各种方式求生，亦以养家。二十岁曾进加州大学读书，一学期后又因贫困辍学。一九○○年出版了第一个小说集《狼子》，立即誉满全国，那时他二十四岁。到一九一六年他年满四十时，已经出版了五十一部著作，是很高产的作家。他的作品独树一帜，充满筋肉暴突的生活和阳刚之气，最受男子汉的欢迎。有人说在他以前的美国小说大都是为姑娘们写的，而他的作品则属于全体读者，不但普通读者欢迎，就是大家闺秀们也喜欢放下窗帘关上大门偷偷去品味他那精力旺盛、气势逼人的作品。他在现代美国文学和世界文学里都享有崇高的地位。

杰克·伦敦的生活经验之丰富在世界作家之中是不多见的。

因为贫困他小学毕业后便去工作，做过报童和罐头工人，在街头斗殴中练出了一身本领，成了小流氓头。他最喜欢的活动是驾驶船只。十三岁时他曾经只身驾驶小船穿过暴风雨中的旧金山湾，别人几乎难以相信，可那是事实。后来他攒了一点钱，买了一只小船，原本是为了好玩，不久后却结识了蚝贼，便也跟他们一样做起不要本钱的买卖。他纠集了一伙同伴，驾船去偷窃旧金山湾养殖户的蚝，甚至烧毁别人的船只。那时他才十五岁，却已经有了一个十六岁的情妇，在船上安了一个家。他打架酗酒，大笑狂欢，在几百英里的海路上自由闯荡。不久以后他结识了海湾巡警，又反过来做了巡警，去追捕盗窃养殖品的贼。

十七岁时他上了一艘捕猎船做水手，经过朝鲜、日本，到西伯利亚去猎海豹。途中他经过了严寒、风暴、最沉重的苦役的锻炼，参加了狩猎海豹的种种活动，对它有了直接的体验。因为从小在海湾里玩船，他驾船很有本领，在船上年纪虽小却深得船主和同行们的赞许。又因为从小饱经摔打，能够参加水手们最野蛮的活动，他交了许多朋友，听了许多有趣的和可怕的故事。这些都成了他的海洋小说的宝贵素材。《海狼》描写的猎海豹船的丰富生活，便是一个很精彩的例子。

远航归来他把自己的经历写成了一篇散文《日本海口的台风》，参加了《呼声》杂志的写作竞赛，荣获了第一名，得到奖金二十元（第二、三名都是大学生），也许他便是因此受到鼓励，走上了文学之路的。

这时杰克·伦敦已经从早期的蒙昧里醒悟过来。他立志掌握当时最先进的技术——电气，便到奥克兰电车公司去求职。他对经理说他为了掌握技术什么苦都可以吃。经理让他一天干活十三个小时，没有星期天，把他累得死去活来。后来他才知道实际上有两个工人被他顶去了工作，那两人每月各四十元，共是八十元，而他一个月才拿三十元。而且一个被他顶去了工作的人因为有一妻三子要养活，却又无法为生，便自杀了。这对于杰克·伦敦是一次极其深刻的教训，他愤然抛下了手里的煤铲。

这次苦役让他懂得了一个可怕的真理：无论自己如何身强力壮，十年、二十年之后总会有更年轻力壮的人来接替他，把他扔到垃圾堆里去。

那时正是美国大萧条的一八九四年，他加入了从旧金山到华盛顿去请愿的失业者队伍，向东海岸进发。他中途因故脱离了队伍，便偷乘火车在北美大陆流浪，跟车警、乘务员捉迷藏，周游全国，以此为乐。他曾经被捕，罚做了三十天苦役，亲眼见到了美国监狱里骇人听闻的现实。出狱后他偷乘西去的列车到了加拿大西海岸，再从那儿做水手南下，回到旧金山。这次特别形式的旅游给了他丰富的人生体验，尤其是贫穷的流浪汉的体验。他明白了一个道理：最能够关心穷苦人的往往是穷苦人。

他对读书一直就有兴趣，就连在做蚝贼时，他也在他那小艇上读过许多书。流浪归来他开始了大量阅读。他读圣西门、傅立叶、蒲鲁东的作品，明白了私有财产的罪恶；他甚至读马克思的《共产党宣言》，大体懂得了共产主义是怎么回事。

为了读书他十九岁时进了奥克兰中学，准备考大学，同时加入了社会党。他参加工人集会，发表激烈的演说，主张破坏现有的社会秩序，并曾经因此被捕。

在奥克兰中学读书时他曾经在学校的报纸上发表了小说《小笠原群岛》，连载了两个月，这样，他从事文学的兴趣更浓厚了。

他曾经希望靠劳动为生，继续读书，却发现那几乎是个幻想。他在一家洗衣作坊工作，累得半死，根本没有时间和精力读书。在他的读书梦濒于破灭时，阿拉斯加发现金矿的消息传来，给他带来了新的希望。一八九七年三月杰克·伦敦踏上了淘金之路。

他求得了一点支持，和三个同伴筹备了八千磅物资准备在克朗代克过冬。他们在寒冬到来之前克服了重重困难，经历了千辛万苦来到了靠近北极的育空河，在那儿度过了冬天。

在到育空河流域去的路上，伦敦的巧妙的驾船技术得到了一次精彩的表演机会。他们自己砍伐木料，造了两艘船，沿育空河往下游航行。途中他们遇见了一段湍急凶险的河道，许多人都曾试图通过而失败，说那段河是无法逾越的天险，但是杰克·伦敦却说他有把握通过。他果然和两个同伴驾了船在围观者的一片欢呼声中安然冲过了急流，再回来驾驶第二只船。这事引起了许多进退两难的淘金人的注意，他们陆陆续续来请求他们帮助把船驶过急流。杰克·伦敦每只船索要报酬二十五元，他掌舵，和伙伴一起把一艘又一艘的木船驶过了险区。他们为此挣了三千元之多。他们原可以再赚五千元的，但是已经没有时间了，他们还得在严冬到来以前赶到下游去。

他在育空河的冬季营地里读了许多书，如达尔文的《物种起源》、斯宾塞的《首要原理》、马克思的《资本论》，还有弥尔顿的《失乐园》和勃朗宁的诗。这些书我们在《海狼》里见到海狼拉尔森读过，也和范·魏登、布露丝特讨论过。

可惜他们并没有在育空河流域找到金子。他们认为是金沙的矿石其实是云母，但是杰克·伦敦的克朗代克之行仍然是硕果累累。他把在千里雪原上的传奇般的经历做了详细的记录，那便是他后来发表的阿拉斯加小说的珍贵素材。

因为没有新鲜水果和蔬菜，杰克·伦敦得了坏血病，只好回家。他和伙伴们驾了一只船，用十九天工夫走完了一千九百英里的航程，来到白令海峡，从那里回到了加利福尼亚。在这一段时间里他已经勾勒出了一些小说的轮廓，后来写了出来，为自己赢得了不朽的名声，也让克朗代克的一些人和狗的故事广泛流传，其中便有《野性的呼唤》里巴克那只狗和其他一些人。

从育空河回来以后他大约有了一点钱，便又读了许多书。他读得很辛苦，每天工作十九个小时。他读经济学，读历史学和历史著作，读生物学、人类学和哲学，也读了大量的文学作品。在他的长篇小说《马丁·伊甸》的主人翁马丁·伊甸身上我们看见了对这段极其艰苦的读书生活的细致刻画。

一九○○年杰克·伦敦的第一本小说集《狼子》出版，立即为他获得了巨大的声誉和相当优厚的收入。他原可以在成功与安定的环境里继续写作，但他不是个安分人，他的血管里燃烧着火焰，总是渴望着新的沸腾的生活，于是他开始了记者生涯。

他应美国新闻社的委派去非洲采访布尔战争，到了伦敦，新闻社中途改变了计划，来电不要他去了。这时他却以美国水手的身份到伦敦贫民窟里去住了三个月，深入了那里的生活，做了详细的调查，取得了第一手资料，回国后出版了报告文学《深渊里的人们》。这本书让他在美国社会主义者中声名大振。

一九○四年他接受了赫斯特报系的聘请，去远东采访日俄战争的消息。他来到日本，看出了日本政府故意留难各国记者的打算，便悄悄一个人去了长崎，想搭上一艘开往朝鲜的船到前线去，却被日本警察当做俄国间谍抓了起来。释放后他又搭了一艘小汽艇到了朝鲜半岛的釜山。汽艇上没有白种人的食物，也无法遮蔽风雨，只能够在严寒的露天甲板上睡觉。到了釜山他弄到了一条无篷的船，雇了三个不会说英语的朝鲜人帮忙，靠自己的驾船本领驶进了黄海，沿着海岸行驶，在零下四十度的严寒和风涛里航行了六天六夜，终于到达仁川。这时他已经遍体鳞伤，脚、手指和耳朵都冻坏了，但是他稍事休整之后便又出发。这回他是骑马旅行，连续几个星期的马背急行军把他带到了平壤，那已经是当时一切战地记者所能够到达的最北之点。他在那里第二次被日本人投入监狱。出狱后他来到距离战线只有四十英里的地方，从那里发出了一篇又一篇的报道和许多照片，完成了其他记者没有完成的任务。他又因故再度受到被捕的威胁，直到引起了美国总统的干预，才得以脱身。在这次完成采访任务的旅行里，伦敦多次在严寒之中驾驶着无篷船航行，对那样严酷的生活有很切身的体会。我们在《海狼》里看见了对这样的生活的引人入胜的生动描述。

这时杰克·伦敦已经誉满全国，有了丰厚的经济收入，但他仍不满足于平静的生活。一九○六年，他决定建造一艘船，自己驾着去环游世界。他预计旅行七年，绕地球一周，可他并不是个好的理财家，造船活动几乎成了个笑话。那船原计划花七千元，实际上让他花了好几万元，而且毛病很多。他不能够再等待，仗着自己驾船的本领就出发了，可他勉强把那船驾到夏威夷，便不得不开始修理，修好后又很吃力地开到了澳大利亚。那船已经无法再前进，他便只好把它以三千元的低价卖掉，结束了这次虽然浪漫却失败的航行。

不过他在那次航行里仍然创造了惊人的业绩。他曾经驾驶那艘蹩脚至极的船从夏威夷直航马克萨斯。当时的《太平洋航运指南》指出，由于赤道海流和贸易风的影响，那一带海流异常复杂，从来没有人曾胜利驾船通过，但是杰克·伦敦却驾驶了他那艘勉强修复的船经过九死一生闯了过去。他在途中染上了一身怪病。

杰克·伦敦成名之后做过几次讲演旅行。在那时的美国，社会主义思想是很犯忌的，但是社会主义者杰克·伦敦却总直言不讳地提出自己的观点。他在加州大学大讲其社会主义革命，受到强烈反对，却得到主张言论自由的校长的保护。他到商人俱乐部大讲其社会主义革命，把一九○五年俄国革命中杀死过几个沙皇官员的革命者称做自己的弟兄，引起了轩然大波，报纸攻击他，说他把杀人犯当做弟兄。他在耶鲁大学发表题为《革命》的演说时，用经济的解剖刀对资本主义剖析了一个小时，最后宣称：“工人阶级的七百万人说：他们就是要使全体工人联合起来，夺取政权。”他的报告受到了热烈的欢迎，尽管听众里真正相信他的理论的人寥寥无几。

因为他的社会主义信仰，他曾经被提名做社会党奥克兰市市长候选人，甚至还做过社会党美国总统候选人。

杰克·伦敦就是这样的性格。他血管里有火，生气勃勃，一身丈夫气，喜欢粗犷强烈的生活。他喜欢叱咤风云，每参加斗争常要斗争到极限。他把冒险里的困难当做享受，把拓荒中的遭遇当做欢乐。我们在《海狼》里看见了许多这样的令人回肠荡气的经历，尽管经过了艺术的折射，跟生活原样已不相同。

就是在他富裕的日子里，他的生活也是充满冒险的。他买地产，办牧场，种树木，修建豪华的新居，宴请宾客，过着沸腾的生活，但是他是个蹩脚的实业家，他办的林场牧场总是失败。

杰克·伦敦之死至今仍是个谜。一九一六年十一月二十一日，星期二，杰克·伦敦计划第二天去纽约，而且打算途中绕道去看看芝加哥赛牲会，买一些良种牛，但是那天晚上他却服用了过量的吗啡死去了。他桌上有个本子，上面写了些计算药量的数字。那时他害着尿毒症，但医生认为把尿毒症看做他的死因是不能叫人信服的。那么只有两种解释：自杀，或是计算药量错误。从他白天的安排看来，不像是自杀；但那么重要的药量计算竟会出错也叫人难以接受。

不过，如若说他是自杀也不是毫无道理的。那几年的生活越来越令他烦恼。他和妻子离了婚，却发现新的妻子跟原来的妻子具有同样的毛病，而他钟爱的女儿却爱着母亲，和他疏远。朋友们因为财富而背叛他。他新修的别墅“狼舍”突然被火烧掉了，给他带来了大笔债务。他种植的四十万株树苗全部死去；他牧场的良种马和猪牛羊也陆续死光了。他心力交瘁，引发了疾病，其中最困扰他的是尿毒症。心理上的极端孤立、生理上的巨大痛苦使他借酒浇愁，他越来越沉湎在酒精里，难以自拔。也许他那天晚上感到太疲倦，太需要解脱，于是饮下了过量的吗啡，悄然脱离了苦海，谁知道！

杰克·伦敦的五十多部作品大体可以分做三大类：描写大自然中的人的作品，描写城市里的人的作品，论文。

他描写在大自然里的人的作品又可以分为两类：极地生活小说和海洋生活小说。

极地生活小说有三个小说集和几部长篇小说。短篇小说集有《狼子》（The Son of the Wolf，1900）、《热爱生命》（Love of Life，1907）和《丢脸》（Lost Face，1910）。长篇小说《燃烧的戴莱特》（Burning Daylight，1910，又译《毒日头》）、《蹩脚·贝路》（Smoke Bellew，1912）和别具一格的狗小说《野性的呼唤》（The Call of the Wild，1903）、《白獠牙》（The White Fang，1906）等。这些小说描写了北极附近严寒地带的人们在最严酷的环境下的斗争。例如短篇小说《生火》描写一个淘金者在华氏零下七十度的旷野里用各种办法生火，终于失败而死的故事，很为悲壮。两本狗小说，《白獠牙》写培养出了野性的狗回到文明，《野性的呼唤》写文明世界的狗在人的逼迫下回到了野蛮。写的虽是狗，却也反映人的世界，在极地生活的人的世界。他的海洋小说包括了小说集《南海故事》（South Sea Tales，1911），狗故事《群岛猎犬杰瑞》（Jerry of the Islands，1917）和《海狼》（The Sea Wolf，1904）等。《南海故事》的南海指的是南太平洋，包括了夏威夷群岛及其一带海域。小说集仿佛是南太平洋土著居民的风俗民情展览和当地风光的画廊。《群岛猎犬杰瑞》描写一头小猎犬落入食人生番的手里，又逃回文明世界的故事。

杰克·伦敦描写城市生活的作品有著名的长篇幻想小说《铁蹄》（The Iron Heel，1908）、幻想小说《亚当以前》（Before Adam，1906）、报告文学《深渊里的人们》（The People of the Abyss，1903）、小说《拳赛》（The Game，1905）、长篇小说《马丁·伊甸》（Martin Eden，1909）及《约翰·巴利科恩》（John Barleycorn，1913）等。《马丁·伊甸》描写一个出身贫苦的水手马丁·伊甸爱上了一个上流社会的小姐露丝，便刻苦奋斗，勤奋写作，想进入上流社会，却为小姐和她的家人所不理解，受到阻碍，又迫于社会压力被迫解除了婚约。但是不久，马丁·伊甸的作品却为出版界所接受，成了大名，获得了丰厚的收入，这时露丝却偷偷到旅馆里来找他了。原来她归根到底爱的还是他的名誉、地位和财富。马丁·伊甸感到严重的幻灭，在赴新的事业的途中蹈海自杀。《铁蹄》预言美国的金融寡头将组织成为法西斯机构“铁蹄”，依靠它控制全国，进行军事寡头统治和特务统治，社会主义者只好与德国的工人阶级联合起来总罢工，以反对美国发起的对德战争，并采取以暴力对暴力的形式进行地下斗争。最后，男主角埃佛哈不幸牺牲，记载故事的文稿便也中断。文稿又以脚注的形式说明法西斯组织“铁蹄”要到三百年后才会被推翻，那时人类才能够进入幸福的集体主义时代。《约翰·巴利科恩》是以禁酒为主题的小说，也带有自传的性质。《拳赛》写一个拳击手的悲剧。他要他的情人去看他比赛，用以消除她对拳击的成见，却在拳击时重伤致死。《亚当以前》也是幻想小说，是把达尔文和华莱士的理论通俗化的尝试，写的是冰河期中期的原始人类的故事。

对杰克·伦敦的作品有人评论为：生气勃勃，健康乐观；也有人认为是文明的头脑与原始的强力的结合，是科学进化论的喉舌，代表了朝气和勇敢。他最擅长的是对于原始暴力和个人奋斗的描写，这在他的极地小说和海洋小说里表现得最为突出。《海狼》和《野性的呼唤》分别是海洋小说和极地小说的代表作。

他的论文集有《阶级战争》（The War of the Classes，1905）和《人类去向》（The Human Drift，1917）等。他的论文集也和他的小说一样受到广大读者欢迎，这是令他的出版商都感到意外的。例如《阶级战争》一年之内就曾经三次再版。美国是个敌视社会主义的国家，但是杰克·伦敦的宣传阶级战争的文集竟然这样畅销，说明他的作品有惊人的魅力。

杰克·伦敦曾经是世界上名气最大的作家之一。他的作品大多出版不久就被译成各国文字，包括法文、俄文、德文、瑞典文、丹麦文、荷兰文、西班牙文、意大利文、希伯来文等。因为意识形态的关系，他的作品在俄国和前苏联很受欢迎，列宁就很欣赏他的《铁蹄》和《热爱生命》。

美国传记小说家伊尔文·斯通在他的杰克·伦敦传《马背上的水手》里称他是美国无产阶级文学之父。

杰克·伦敦写《野性的呼唤》时选了一个很新颖的题材：狗。不是法布尔科学故事里的生物学的狗，也不是神话或童话里的幻想的狗，甚至不是穿插在人类社会里的小角色的狗，而是担任着全书主角的狗，以其在冰天雪地里的生活、性格、情趣、事迹震撼读者心灵的狗。书中描写了主角巴克和他的那么多狗伙伴，包括他的“敌人”。

巴克是一只圣伯纳犬和一只苏格兰牧羊犬的混血儿。圣伯纳犬是瑞士雪山里的救护犬，牧羊犬是要和狼战斗的狗，都是健壮结实经得起摔打和严寒的品种。他生长在加利福尼亚温暖地带的富贵人家，“是米勒法官领地上所有爬着走、匍匐着走、飞着走的生物的大王”，“有十足的王室气派”，但是，他被人偷走了，辗转卖到了北方严寒的淘金路上。“帝王蒙尘”遭到的第一次不礼貌待遇是一根绳子，把他绞得昏死过去，放到车上运走了，但那还不过是个开始。他的真正教训是从一个穿红绒线衫的人那儿得到的。那是一顿大棒的反复猛打，一次再次地打得他昏死过去。

接受了那入门课，他明白了弱肉强食的规律，心里潜在的原始的狡猾天性被唤醒了。他明白了“手拿大棒的人就是制定法律的人”，虽然未必能够跟他和解，却不能够不服从。

突然从文明的中心落入了原始中心的巴克，开始了适应环境的奋斗。如果说大棒教了他入门课的话，他的同胞狗群就教给了他更残酷的正文。他看见了鬈毛的惨死，鬈毛只因为向斯匹茨表示友好，却无辜被咬伤，摔倒在地，转瞬之间便给等在旁边的一圈狗吃掉了，而同样的命运也等待着巴克和每一只狗。严峻的现实教给了巴克聪明，或者说狡猾。于是他学会了斗争。他发现自己的食物被人偷吃抢吃，自己便也偷了起来。作者说，这变化说明了巴克的适应能力，“也标志着他的道德本性的蜕化与解体。那是一种虚荣，在残酷的生存竞争中是一种障碍。在南方的国土上，在爱与友谊的法则之下，尊重私有财产和个人感情是不错的，但是在北方的国土上，在大棒和獠牙的法律之下，谁若把那类东西当回事便是傻瓜，只要他仍然遵守那类法则他准倒霉”。

巴克不是喜欢偷，他是非偷不可。他不明抢，而是耍狡猾，暗偷。那是出于对大棒和獠牙的尊重。他从经验里学习。他早已消失的本能复活了。他朦胧地记起了自己种族的青年时代；祖先们记录在遗传里的古老技巧便成了他的技巧。同时，他原始的野性，对蛮荒生活的依恋也复活了。他甚至坐在旷野里对着月色发出悠悠的嚎叫，特别是在听见狼嚎的晚上。最后，他在心爱的主人被印第安人杀死之后回到了丛林，跟狼成了一群，完成了他从文明到野蛮的彻底蜕化过程。带讽刺意义的是，造成了他这蜕化的是文明的人。

以这个故事为框架，小说讲述了一连串的狗故事，真可以说是妙趣横生，好戏连台。就以雪原邮队的九条狗而言，每条都有自己的性格。斯匹茨来自挪威的斯匹茨贝根，表面和善，实际凶残，善良的鬈毛就是因为向他讨好，被撕掉了脸皮，斗倒在地，被围观的狗们吃掉的。比利和乔是一母所生，性格之不同却如白天和黑夜。一个软弱，受到挑战总息事宁人地摇尾巴；一个却顽强，无论斯匹茨怎样威胁，他总激烈地反抗，不给他任何便宜。达利脆弱，经受不起雪原上风餐露宿的长期奔跑，疯了，被杀掉。两员老将大卫和索莱克斯平时懒洋洋，万事不关心，到了雪橇的辕轭下立即精神焕发，表现了狗界首领的风范，调教部属，奖勤罚懒，从不滥施淫威，像人一样有分寸。索莱克斯更透着清高，淡于名利，只求做好分内的工作，在雪原上跑个痛快，别的一概不计较。巴克斗死斯匹茨后，主人把索莱克斯升任排头狗，巴克不答应，索莱克斯却不计较，似乎大度而谦和，终于把那荣誉拱手让给了巴克，毫无怨艾。大卫则是个“鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已”的“诸葛亮”，已经病到无可奈何，仍然挣扎到狗轭下，要继续尽他辕狗的职责（或是享他辕狗的权利？），直到寸步难行，倒到地上。那情节真是英雄末路，很透着苍凉悲壮。

当然，主角是巴克，主要的戏都在他身上。我们读到许多有趣的描写，有些小故事是可以当做散文读的，好比是些动物小品，但最有趣的自然还是他和阴险的斯匹茨争霸的故事。自从巴克的兽性被诱发以后，跟斯匹茨之间的斗争就势所难免。先是斯匹茨一次次挑战，巴克一次次退让，然后是斯匹茨霸占巴克雪夜的温暖的窝，引发了第一次冲突。接着是巴克反客为主，利用雪鞋兔事件发起袭击，经过惨烈的决斗，终于斗倒了斯匹茨，让他被虎视眈眈围成一圈的看客们吃掉。然后出现了巴克争夺排头狗职位的不说话光表演的那场闹剧，令人忍俊不禁。

巴克终于争霸成功，成了雪橇队的排头狗。那光荣是凭他自己的聪明、膂力与顽强获得的，但是，那也只意味着在雪原上的无穷无尽的奔跑，直跑得九死一生，濒于死亡。这之后才侥幸落到他的新主人索恩顿手里。他不但在索恩顿那里得到了休息，恢复了健康，而且体会到了真正的爱：人对狗的爱和狗对人的爱，“炽烈燃烧的爱，那是崇拜，那是狂热，是只有约翰·索恩顿才能够燃起的”。接下来是巴克登峰造极的几次活动：急流救主、赌博争胜和回到蛮荒之后的惊人之举——一匹狗对一群高大的麋鹿的战斗。他把鹿群的首领老公鹿逼离了群，困得他筋疲力尽，终于把他拖倒，咬死，吃掉。然后，这位加利福尼亚庄园里自封的“国王”变成了育空河荒原里的狼群的领袖。“冬季的长夜到来，狼群跟随食物进入低谷时，却可以看见他巨大的身影在灰白的月光里或是在漠漠闪动的北极光里领着狼群蹦跳。”这里的“他”就是巴克。

《海狼》和《野性的呼唤》都写了大棒政策。《野性的呼唤》的大棒政策是成功的，因为它的对象是狗。大棒的打击和环境的变化唤醒了巴克的野性，唤醒了他对祖先和原始人类的朦胧的回忆，终于回到了蛮荒里去，成了狼的伙伴。而《海狼》里的大棒政策却失败了，因为它的对象是人，是有人的尊严和自我意识的文明人。不过，我们也看见野性在大知识分子范·魏登的心里部分地复苏过。他和伙夫汤玛士·玛格瑞季之间那场磨刀的闹剧便是一个可怕的例子。在人们无可奈何时，也不是没有可能从人堕落为野兽的。那可是大棒政策的成就。这就使我们深思。不知道这样的处境如果长期地、反复地继续下去，人们的道德本性会不会也随之而堕落，形成“道德本性的蜕化与解体”，让人们认为“道德本性是一种虚荣，在残酷的生存竞争中是一种障碍”，从而退回到精神上的蛮荒世界里去。





第一章　进入蛮荒


古老的漫游的欲望在跳跃，

撕扯着习俗的链条；

再一次从寒冬的沉睡里

唤醒了野性的曲调。

巴克不看报，否则他就知道大难临头了。不但他要遭难，就是海岸河口一切狗类都要遭难。从普格特湾[1]到圣地亚戈[2]，凡是肌肉结实、长着温暖的长毛的狗都要遭难。因为人类在北极的黑暗中探索时找到了一种黄色的金属；因为轮船公司和运输公司都在大肆吹嘘这一发现，成千上万的人都在往北方拥去。他们人人都需要狗，结实的狗，肌肉暴突能干活的狗，有厚而长的毛能经得起霜冻的狗。

巴克住在阳光普照的圣克拉拉谷一幢大房子里。那房子叫米勒法官大屋，远离大路，绿树掩映，从树丛中依稀可以看到屋子四面宽阔幽静的凉台。那大屋有碎石汽车道连通，车道穿过宽阔的草地和枝叶扶疏的高大的白杨林。后面的景色比前面的气魄更为宏大，这里有巨大的马厩，十二个马夫马童在那儿应差；有爬满长春藤的仆人住房；有一眼看不完的整整齐齐的外层房舍；有长长的葡萄架，青青的牧草地；有花圃和草莓园，还有喷水井；有水泥修的大池，米勒法官的男孩子们早上在这儿跳水，炎热的下午在这儿浸凉。

这片世界是巴克的天下。他在这儿出生，在这儿长到了四岁。是的，这儿还有别的狗。这么大的地盘还能没有别的狗吗？可那些狗全都微不足道，他们来了，又走了，在狗群集居的狗窝里住住，或是在屋里某个僻静角落悄悄地过几天，就像那条日本叭儿狗土次或是那条墨西哥没毛的伊萨伯尔一样——都是些奇怪的狗，很少有把鼻子伸到门外或是到场子里走走的。另外，也有猎狐，至少有二十条之多，他们总对在窗户里往外瞧他们的土次和伊萨伯尔狂吠，并保证要干出些可怕的事，尽管那两条狗有一大群手执扫帚和拖把的女仆保护。

巴克既不是宠物，也不是猎狗，但这一片天地却是他的。他跳到游泳池里游泳，或是跟法官的儿子去打猎；他给法官的女儿摩莉和阿丽丝当保镖，陪她们在漫长的黄昏或是清晨到处游逛。冬天晚上他睡在法官脚边，面对着图书室呼啸的火苗；他把法官的孙子背在背上，或是跟他们在草地上打滚，或是保护着他们一直走到马厩院子里的泉水边去，做各种胆大的冒险，甚至远征到练马的围场和草莓园去。他在狗群中威严地行走，从来不把土次和伊萨伯尔放在心里，因为他是大王——是米勒法官领地上所有爬着走、匍匐着走、飞着走的生物的大王，连人也在内。

他的父亲爱尔莫，一条圣伯纳大种狗，曾是法官形影不离的伙伴，巴克也满有希望走他父亲的路。他个子没有他父亲大——只有一百四十磅，因为他的母亲舍卜是条苏格兰牧羊犬，不过，一百四十磅体重加上优裕的生活和普遍的尊重养成了他的尊严，使他带上了十足的王室气派。在脱离幼狗期后的四年中他过的是志得意满的贵族生活。他颇为自豪，总有几分自我中心意识——与世隔绝的乡绅们大多是如此的，不过他并没有变得娇生惯养，这倒救了他的命。狩猎和类似的户外活动控制了他的脂肪，锻炼了他的肌肉；对水的兴趣对他正如对其他喜爱游泳的人一样是一剂补药，也保持了他的健康。

一八九七年秋天巴克的情况就是这样。那时克朗代克的新发现把人们从世界各地吸引到了冰天雪地的北方。但是巴克不读报，不知道花匠的一个助手曼纽埃尔并不是个可爱的朋友。曼纽埃尔有一个大毛病：喜欢玩中国彩票。他玩彩票还有一个大毛病：相信一套赌法。这就使他不能不倒霉，因为要照一套赌法赌是要花大钱的，而当花匠副手的工资在养活了老婆和一大群后代之后又所剩无几。

曼纽埃尔干坏事的那个值得纪念的晚上，法官到葡萄种植家协会开会去了，男孩子们又忙于组织运动员俱乐部，没有人看见他和巴克穿过果园走了出去。巴克以为只是溜达。除了一个人谁也没见他俩来到小小的信号停车站——那地方叫社团公园。那人跟曼纽埃尔说了几句话，两人之间便有了银洋的叮当声。

“你得包装好再交货。”陌生人粗声粗气地说，曼纽埃尔把一根粗绳双折起来，套在巴克脖子上的项圈下面。

“一绞绳子就能憋得他够戗。”曼纽埃尔说，陌生人哼了一声，表示赞同。

巴克一声不响庄严地接受了绳套，这肯定是新鲜事，不过他已经习惯于信任他认识的人，相信他们比自己更有头脑，但是当绳套那头交到了陌生人手里的时候，他也发出威胁的咆哮。他很自尊，只不过略为表示了几分不满，他相信略有表示便已是命令，但是出乎他意外的是，那绳却在他脖子上绞紧了，绞得他出不了气。他立即大发雷霆向那人扑去，那人却半道上抓住他喉咙的附近，巧妙地一扭，把他摔翻在地。然后那绳便毫不留情地绞紧了。巴克气急败坏地挣扎着，舌头努出了嘴外，巨大的胸脯无可奈何地喘着气。他一辈子也没受过这么恶毒的对待，没发过这么大的脾气，但是他力气不济了，目光也呆滞了，等到打出信号让火车停下，两人把他扔进行李车厢时，他已完全失去了知觉。

他此后知道的第一件事就是模糊地感到舌头很痛，自己在辆什么车上摇摇晃晃地向前行。火车头到达十字路口时的嘶哑鸣叫告诉他他已来到了什么地方。他跟法官出门的次数很多，哪能不知道坐行李车的滋味。他睁开眼，像被绑架的国王一样，眼里露出难以遏制的愤怒。那人扑向他的喉咙，但是，巴克行动更快，一口咬住了他的手。双方都不肯放松，直到他被绞得昏死过去。

“操，它有时可真发疯。”那人说，不让行李员看见他被咬伤的手——行李员被厮斗的声音引了过来。

“我带他到旧金山的老板那儿去。那儿有个狗医忒棒，说是能治这病。”

在旧金山海岸一家沙龙后的棚屋里那人对那天的夜车之行大侃了一番。

“我一共得到了五十元，”他嘟哝道，“哪怕是给我一千块我也不再干了。”

他的手裹在一条血糊糊的手巾里，右裤腿从膝盖直撕到脚踝。

“那家伙得了多少？”沙龙老板问。

“一百，”他回答说，“一分也不肯少，上帝保佑。”

“一共一百五，”沙龙老板算了算，“这狗能值这个价，否则我就是个傻瓜。”

那拐卖人解开血糊糊的手巾看着咬破的手。“我若是不得狂犬病……”

“那也是你命中注定，”沙龙老板笑了起来，“喏，先别走，帮个忙。”他又说。

巴克昏了过去，他给绞了个半死。喉咙和舌头痛得难以忍受。他想跟折磨他的人干一场，却给扔倒在地上，一再受到扭绞，最后他们才从他脖子上锉下了那个厚重的青铜项圈，取下绳套，把他扔进一个笼子一样的运货箱里。

他躺在那里度过了那个讨厌的夜晚的剩下的时光，平息着肚里的怒火，安抚着被伤害的自尊。他不明白这一切都是为了什么，这些陌生人要拿他干什么，他们干吗把他关在这个狭窄的运货箱里。这些他都不懂，一种大祸临头的感觉却压在心里。夜里有好几次棚屋的门当啷一声打开了，这时他便跳了起来，以为会见到法官，至少是几个男孩。可每一次都是沙龙老板那张胖胖的脸映着牛油烛的惨淡的光在打量他。在巴克喉咙里颤抖的欢叫每一次都被扭曲成了野蛮低沉的嚎叫。

但是沙龙老板并不理他。早上进来了四个人，抬起了运货箱。巴克认定这些人又是来折磨他的，因为他们的样子凶恶，而且邋遢褴褛，便隔着箱格子对着他们大发雷霆。他们只是一味地笑，而且用棍子撩他，他立即去咬棍子，后来他才明白他们正希望他那样做。于是他气冲冲地躺下了，让运货箱给抬进了一个车厢。他和囚禁他的运货箱经过了好几双手：快车办公室的职员把他送进另一个车厢里运走；一辆马车把他运走；一辆卡车又把他跟一些箱子和包裹送上了一艘渡船；然后有人用卡车把他从渡船送进一个巨大的铁路堆栈；最后他被送进了一列特快列车的车厢。特快车厢被一个呜呜叫的火车头拖着走了两天两夜，巴克也就两天两夜没吃没喝。因为愤怒，他一见特快车送件人活动便发出怒吼，他们也以揶揄他作为回答。他气得发抖，口吐白沫扑向箱格，他们便哈哈大笑，更来逗他。他们学下贱可憎的狗汪汪乱叫，又学猫叫，还扑扇着双臂学鸡叫。他明白那都很愚蠢，可正因为如此他更感到有损尊严，脾气也越来越大。饿，他倒不太在乎；没有水却叫他痛苦不堪，也煽动他的怒火，使他发狂。由于高度紧张、敏感和种种虐待，他发起烧来，喉咙和舌头的干渴红肿加重了他的炎症。

有一件事却叫他高兴：脖子上的绳套取掉了。这给了他一种单方面的优势，没有了绳子他就可以让他们瞧瞧厉害了。他已下定了决心不让他们给他套上第二根绳。他两天两夜没吃没喝所受到的痛苦积累成了一种震怒，谁若是碰上了可得倒大霉。他双眼充血，变成了一个暴怒的妖魔。他的变化十分大，就是法官本人见了怕也认不出他来了；特快车邮递员们在西雅图打发他上了火车之后全都松了一口气。

四个人小心翼翼抬着这货箱下了车，进了一个后院，后院四面都是高墙。一个人走了出来，给司机签了字。那人很壮实，穿一件红色绒线衫，衣领搭拉下一大截。巴克估计下一个对头就是他，便对着箱格野蛮地扑了过去。那人阴沉地笑了笑，拿来了一把斧头和一根大棒。

“你不是打算现在就放他吧？”司机问。

“当然要放。”那人回答，用斧头砍进箱子，又当做撬棍撬了起来。

抬箱子的四个人立即散开了，爬到墙顶上的安全地点看表演。

巴克对劈开的木头冲去，扑着，咬着，叫着，斧子落在外面，他就在里面咬，龇着牙大声咆哮。那穿红绒线衣的人冷冷的，一心要放他，他却暴跳如雷心急火燎想往外跑。

“来吧，你这急红了眼的妖怪。”他开了一个大小足以让巴克身子钻出来的洞，对巴克说。这时他放下斧头把大棒转到了右手。

巴克的确是个急红了眼的妖怪。他后蹲半步准备好出击，耸起鬣毛，喷出白沫，充血的眼睛放出疯狂的光。他集中了他一百四十磅的身子里两天两夜积聚的狂怒向那人扑了过去。到了空中他的牙床快要咬住那人了，身子却突然一震，被挡住了，那一震使他牙床痛苦地一磕，身子一翻，背脊跟身子的一侧触了地。他这一辈子从没挨过大棒，不知道那是什么意思。他嚎叫了一声，小半是叫喊，大半是痛苦，然后一翻身站住脚跟，又蹿上了空中。又是猛然一震，叭的一声摔倒在地。这一回他明白了是那大棒，但是由于疯狂他却不懂得小心。他进攻了十来次，也被大棒打倒在地上十来次。

在一次特别猛烈的打击之后勉强站起身子时，他已昏昏沉沉再也扑不出去了，只能颤颤巍巍有气无力地迈了迈步。血从他鼻子、嘴和耳朵里流了出来，他那身漂亮的毛衣上溅满了斑斑点点带血的唾沫。这时那人却抢前一步对着他的鼻子狠狠一棒打了过来。这一棒可痛得他钻心彻骨，比他挨过的所有的棒子都厉害。他发出一声凶暴得像雄狮的怒吼纵身一跳，再次往那人扑去。可那人却把大棒转到了左手，用右手冷冷地揪住了他的喉头，往后下方一扭一带，巴克便在空中画了足足一个半圆圈，然后脑袋连着胸脯一起叭的一声摔在地上。

他又做了最后的冲刺。那人打出了他一直有意保留的最精彩的一棒，巴克砰的一声上了天，又落了下来，完全失去了知觉。

“这人驯狗可真不赖，我敢说。”坐在墙上的人很带劲地叫道。

“德鲁脱每天都驯印第安马呢，星期天还驯两匹。”赶车的一边爬上车赶着马离开，一边搭腔。

巴克苏醒了过来，可是再没了力气，只能躺在落下的地方，观察着穿红绒线衣的人。

“‘这狗叫巴克。’”那人独自念着沙龙老板发出运货箱和货物的通知，“好了，巴克，孩子，”他和善地说，“咱俩较量了一下，以后最好就像这样过下去。你明白了你自己的地位，我也知道我的责任。你要做条好狗，就万事大吉，大雁在天上飞，可你要是调皮捣蛋，我能把你心肝五脏都抠出来，懂不懂？”

说话时他毫不畏惧地拍着他刚才狠狠揍过的脑袋。巴克的毛虽然因这一拍不自觉地倒竖起来，他却只好承受了，并没有抗议。那人给他拿来了水，他立即喝了起来，后来又吞下了好丰盛的一顿生肉，是由那人用手一块一块喂给他的。

他明白他失败了，但他并没有被打倒。他从此懂得了一个道理：在拿着大棒的人面前他是没有希望的。他接受了这次教训，以后一辈子也没有忘记。那大棒是一种启示，是他学习弱肉强食的原始统治法的入门课，他是迎面接受了这堂课的。生活的现实比这还要凶残；在他毫无畏惧地面对它的时候，他也使用了他潜在的被唤醒的狡猾的天性。过了几天，又来了一些狗。有用运货箱运来的，有用绳索套来的，有的驯服，有的跟他来时一样愤怒地咆哮着。他眼看着他们一个个在穿红绒线衣的人手下老实下来。他看着一次又一次的暴力表演，对那教训的体会也就越来越深：手拿大棒的人就是制定法律的人，就得服从，虽然未必能跟他和解。他从来没有和解过，虽然他见过挨打的狗向那人献媚，摇尾巴，舔他的手，也见过一条永不和解永不服从的狗终于在争夺自主权的斗争中被杀死。

时常有人来，全是些陌生人。他们激动地谈着话，用各种方式各种甜言蜜语讨好穿红绒线衫的人。等到银货两清，客人们便带着一条或几条狗走掉了。巴克不知道他们的去向，因为他们从没回来过，但是他对未来却十分害怕，因此每一回没挑上他他都感到高兴。

可他终于被挑上了。那是个满脸皱纹的小个子，结结巴巴说着蹩脚的英语，骂出许多巴克听不懂的陌生的脏话。

“圣母娘娘！”他一眼看到巴克就叫了起来，“那条他奶奶的牛头狗！呃！咋卖？”

“三百块，算人情，”穿红绒线衫的人立刻回答，“花的是政府的钱，你也不喜欢多费唇舌，是吗，佩罗特？”

佩罗特咧开嘴笑了。由于需求剧增，狗价一直直线上升，这样一条好狗开这个价可不算敲竹杠。加拿大政府不会吃亏的，邮件也不会耽搁。佩罗特懂得狗，他一见到巴克便看出那是千里挑一、万里挑一的好狗，他在心里估量着。

巴克看见交了钱，便由那满脸皱纹的小个子把鬈毛——一条脾气很好的纽芬兰狗——和他一起带走了，他也不觉得意外。那是他最后一次见到那穿红绒线衫的人。在鬈毛和他一起站在“纳华尔号”的甲板上望着退去的西雅图时，那便是他最后一次看到温暖的南方土地。佩罗特把鬈毛和他带下甲板，交给了一个黑脸的巨人法朗索瓦。佩罗特是个法裔加拿大人，皮肤黝黑，而法朗索瓦却是个法裔加拿大的混血儿，有他两倍黑。在巴克眼里他们是另一种人（他命中注定要见到许多这样的人），他对他们虽然没产生什么感情，却也打心眼儿里尊重。他很快便明白了佩罗特和法朗索瓦办事公道，文文静静，不偏不私。他们对狗的习性很熟悉，是不怕狗玩花招的。

在“纳华尔号”中层甲板上巴克和鬈毛又会合了另外两条狗。有一条是大狗，从斯匹次卑尔根[3]来的，一身雪白的毛，曾被一艘捕鲸船的船长买去，后来又随一支地质勘探队进入过巴伦地区[4]。

那狗很和善，却透着奸诈，一面想着鬼点子，一面对着你笑。比如巴克吃第一顿饭他就偷了他一块肉。巴克正要惩罚他，法朗索瓦的鞭子已经在空中唱起歌来，抢先教训了罪犯一顿。巴克无事可做，只需去抢回骨头就行了。他认为法朗索瓦这一招很公道，那混血儿在他的评价中的地位上升了。

另一条狗不侵犯谁，也不受谁侵犯，也不偷新来的狗的东西。那是个阴沉的闷闷不乐的家伙，他的鬈毛表示：他的全部愿望就是别人不要来碰他，谁若碰了他那可是自讨苦吃。他名叫大卫。他光吃饭，睡觉，有时打打哈欠，此外对什么都不感兴趣，就是在“纳华尔号”驶过了夏洛特皇后湾[5]之后，前颠后簸摇摇摆摆像中了魔法一样时他也满不在乎。巴克和鬈毛都很激动，一半也是害怕。大卫却抬起头，仿佛厌恶，只赏给了他俩一个漠不关心的眼光，便又躺下睡觉。

海船日日夜夜随着推进器不知疲倦的搏动而颤抖着，虽然今天和昨天没有什么两样，巴克却显然感到天气在不断变冷。一天早上，推进器终于停止了声音，“纳华尔号”上弥漫了一种激动的气氛。这一点他跟别的狗都感觉到，而且知道马上就要出现变化。法朗索瓦给他们套上了绳索，带他们上了甲板。第一步踏上寒冷的船面，巴克的脚便踩在一种软唧唧很像烂泥的白东西上。他一喷鼻息跳了回来。那种白东西还在从天上往下落。他抖抖身子，又有更多的白东西落在他身上。他好奇地闻了闻，然后用舌头舔了一点，那东西像火一样咬他，可马上又没有了。他感到纳闷；他又试了试，结果相同。看热闹的人哈哈大笑，他感到丢脸，可不知道为什么，因为那是他第一次见到雪。

第二章　大棒与獠牙的法律


巴克在岱亚沙滩的第一天像是一场噩梦，每一小时都充满了打击和意外。他是突然从文明的中心被扔进原始的中心的。这儿再没有阳光亲吻着的游手好闲百无聊赖的生活。这儿没有和平，没有休息，没有片刻安全。一切全是混乱和骚动，生命和肢体每时每刻都受着威胁。在这儿你不能不时刻保持警惕，因为这儿的狗和人不是城市的狗和人，全是些野蛮的东西，除了大棒和獠牙的法律不知道任何法律。

他从来没见过狗与狗像那些狼一样的动物那样打过架。他的第一次经验给了他永远难忘的教训。不错，那只是别人的经历，否则他是无法活下来从中吸取教训的。受害的是鬈毛。他们在木料场宿营，鬈毛在那儿挺友好地向一条结实的狗献殷勤，那狗个子虽然有成熟的狼那么大，却还没有鬈毛个子的一半。他一点征兆都没有就像闪电一样跳了起来，牙齿发出金属般的咬啮声，然后是同样飞快地一跳，鬈毛的脸皮就从眼睛处被撕开，直拉到下巴上。

突击，随即跳开，这是狼的战术，但事情还没有完。三四十条雪橇狗来到了现场，把两员战将围了起来，形成一个沉默的虎视眈眈的圆圈。巴克不懂得那虎视眈眈的沉默的意义，也不懂得他们何以那么急切地舔着自己的下巴。鬈毛向对手扑去，那家伙又是咬了一嘴便跳开了。她再一次进攻，他却用胸膛迎接了她，并用一种特别的方式把她摔翻在地。她从此就没再站起身来。在一旁等待的雪橇狗等的就是这个。他们向她扑了过去，龇牙咧嘴汪汪大叫，于是她便痛苦地狂吠着被埋葬了。埋在那一群鬣毛直竖的身子底下。

这事来得这么突然，这么意外，吓得巴克倒退了一步。他看到斯匹茨把他那鲜红的舌头伸了出来，那是他在笑；他看到法朗索瓦摇晃着一把斧头跳进乱七八糟的狗群。三个拿大棒的人也来帮他撵狗。不大会儿工夫，鬈毛倒下后才两分钟，袭击她的狗群就已全被棒子赶走了。可是她却倒在那踩得一团糟的雪地里，一动不动，没有了生命，说她被卸成了八块并不夸张。黑皮肤的混血儿躬下身子看着她，嘴里狠狠地骂着。这个场面以后常回到巴克心里，使他魂梦不安。原来是这么个办法，而且不讲公道。只要你倒下，你就算完了。好，他可得小心，千万别倒下。斯匹茨再次伸出舌头笑着，从那时起巴克便永远对他恨之入骨。

他还没从鬈毛悲惨的死亡造成的惊恐中回过神来，又给吓了第二次。法朗索瓦在他脖子上系了一条皮带和带箍。那是缰，他在家里见过，是马夫套在马脖子上用的。而且他也像马一样被赶着干起活来，拖着雪橇送法朗索瓦到峡谷边的树林里去，又从那儿拉回了一捆柴火。也就像这样变成了个干活的牲口，这很伤他的自尊心，但他很聪明，没有反抗。他下定决心努力干活，虽然这样的事他从没遇见过，而且感到奇怪。法朗索瓦很严厉，他要求立即服从，由于他手中有鞭子，他也立即得到服从。大卫一见他犯错误就咬他的屁股，大卫是有经验的辕狗。斯匹茨是排头狗，也很有经验。他虽然未必总有机会教训巴克，却不时地对他尖声咆哮，表示不满，或是狡猾地往一边用力，迫使巴克走回正路。巴克学得很快，在两位伙伴和法朗索瓦的共同调教下有了显著的进步，还没有回到营地他就懂得一听见“哇”就站住，一听见“呣”就前进，拐弯要绕大圈，拖着重载雪橇下坡要离辕狗远点。

“三只狗都很棒。”法朗索瓦告诉佩罗特，“那只巴克，很他娘的卖力气，学得很快。”

下午佩罗特急于上路完成任务，又带回两只狗。他把他俩叫“比利”和“乔”。那是两兄弟，都很结实。虽然是一母所生，性格却截然不同，有如白天和黑夜。比利有一个毛病：脾气太好。而乔则恰好相反，脾气很坏，内向，永远咆哮着，眼露凶光。巴克对他俩很客气，大卫却不理他们，而斯匹茨却一个一个地收拾他俩。比利息事宁人地摇尾巴，一见不行便逃，斯匹茨的利齿咬到他的腰他便叫喊（仍然是息事宁人的调子）；可是不管斯匹茨怎样围着他转，乔却以后脚为圆心转着圈面对他，鬣毛耸起，耳朵后缩，嘴唇抽动，牙床飞快地开合，眼露凶光，发出汪汪大叫，像魔鬼一样——活脱脱一副心怀畏惧却挺身而战的形象。那样子十分可怕，斯匹茨只好放弃了整治他的打算。但是为了掩饰自己的狼狈，他却转向息事宁人的哀号着的比利，把它追出了营地之外。

黄昏时佩罗特又弄来了一只狗，一只结实的老狗，又瘦又长，满脸伤疤，只有一只眼，眼里闪出一种警告：我有能耐，你们可得放尊重点。他的名字叫索莱克斯，意思是“脾气大”。他跟大卫一样，不要什么，不给什么，也不希望什么；他不慌不忙走进狗群时就连斯匹茨也没敢惹他。他有一个特点偏偏叫倒霉的巴克发现了：不喜欢别人从他瞎眼的一面靠近他。巴克不知不觉触犯了这个忌讳，是索莱克斯忽然转过身来狠狠咬了他肩头一口才使他明白了自己的错误。那一口直咬到骨头，撕开了一个三寸长的口子。从此之后巴克便回避他瞎眼的一面，而从此以后双方便也和睦相处，相安无事。索莱克斯唯一的，也是明显的愿望便是不让人碰他，跟大卫一样，虽然巴克后来才知道他俩还各有一个更为重要的愿望。

那天晚上巴克遇到了一个大问题：睡觉。帐篷在白色的平原上由烛光照着发出温暖的光，但在他理所当然地走进帐篷时佩罗特和法朗索瓦却对他大喊大叫，还拿炊事用品砸他，直到他大吃一惊省悟过来，狼狈逃窜到外面的寒气之中。寒风飕飕，吹得他生疼，肩上受伤的地方尤其疼痛难当。他想躺到雪上睡，可是霜冻立即冻得他发抖，站了起来。他凄凄惶惶，心烦意乱，在帐篷之间游荡，却发现到处都是一样，冷得够戗。偶尔还遇上野蛮的狗向他扑来，可是他一竖起鬣毛，发出咆哮（他学得很快），对方也就让他走掉，不再加以干涉。

最后他想出了个主意：回去看同队的狗是怎么睡的。出乎他意料，伙伴们全都消失了。为了找他们，他又在巨大的宿营地东逛西逛，终于逛了回来。他们是在帐篷里吗？不会的，不可能，否则他不会给赶出来的。那么他们到哪儿去了呢？他夹着尾巴，全身发抖，围着帐篷无目的地转悠，好不凄惨难受。突然他前脚的雪塌了，他掉了下去。脚下却有个什么东西在拱动。他跳了回来，耸起毛，发出咆哮，对没见到的不知道的东西感到害怕。可是一声轻轻的友好的吠声却使他安下心来，他回头一看，一股热气升到他的鼻尖，是比利，在雪下蜷成一个舒适的球躺着。

比利轻声呜呜着联络感情，扭动身子表示友好，甚至冒险用他那温暖的湿润的舌头舔了舔巴克的脸，向他贿取和平。

又是一课。原来他们是这么睡的，呃？巴克满怀信心选定了一个地方，摆开架势费了好大劲为自己挖了个洞。只一会儿工夫他的体温便充满了那小小的天地，他睡着了。那一天过得又漫长又辛苦，他睡得很沉很舒服，虽然他跟噩梦斗争有时也咆哮，也吠叫。

他是直到营地里有了人声才张开眼睛的。刚开始他还不知道自己在什么地方。一夜的雪把他全埋住了。雪墙从四面八方紧压着他。一阵巨大的恐惧穿过他全身——野生动物对陷阱的恐惧。那是他在自己的生命中重现了祖先的生命的一种迹象。因为他是一只文明狗，一只不应该文明的文明狗。他在自己的生活中从没见过陷阱，因此不可能自己懂得害怕它。出于本能他全身的肌肉开始抽搐，像是在痉挛，颈部和肩上的毛倒竖着。他发出一声凶猛的嚎叫，一蹦老高，跳入耀眼的白昼里，雪片在他身边如云片般飞扬。他四脚还没有点地便看见眼前白茫茫的营地，想起了自己身在何处，也想起了过去的一切：从跟随曼纽埃尔散步到他昨天晚上为自己挖出的洞。

法朗索瓦一声吆喝迎接了他的出现。“我说得不错吧？”狗夫对佩罗特叫道，“那巴克学什么都快。”

佩罗特认真地点了点头。他是加拿大政府的信使，身负重任，急于弄到最好的狗，因此为得到了巴克而特别高兴。

一个小时不到又增加了三只雪橇狗。狗的总数达到了九条。一刻钟还没过去，他们都已上好了套，沿着雪橇路往岱亚峡谷迤逦而去。巴克乐意出发，工作虽然辛苦他却发现自己并不太瞧不起它。使整个狗队激动的那种迫切情绪令他感到意外，但也感染了他。可更令他意外的却是大卫和索莱克斯身上的变化。虽都是新来的，辔头却把他俩完全改变了。他们满身的消极冷淡没有了，倒变得敏捷活跃起来。他们急于把工作做好，不管是什么，只要造成了耽搁或混乱，影响了工作进度，他们都会发脾气。辔头下的苦活似乎成了他们存在的最高表现和生命的全部目的，也是唯一使他们快乐的东西。

大卫是辕狗或叫橇头狗，在他前面是巴克，再前面是索莱克斯，狗队其他的狗往前一字儿排开直到排头狗，那职位由斯匹茨充任。

巴克是被有意安排在大卫和索莱克斯之间的，为的是教育他。他是好学生，他们也是好老师，绝不让他继续犯错误，总用尖利的牙给他上课。大卫很公正，也很聪明，绝不无缘无故咬巴克，而在该咬的时候也从不宽容。由于法朗索瓦有鞭子撑腰，巴克觉得与其反抗倒不如改过为好。有一次休息之后，巴克因为皮带绊住，起步晚了一点，大卫和索莱克斯便都向他扑去，狠狠地教训了他一顿，结果皮带更乱了，但是从此以后巴克便很注意保持皮带的条理。一天没过完，他已经熟悉了他的工作，两位伙伴也差不多不再找他麻烦了。法朗索瓦的鞭子抽得少了，佩罗特甚至给了他一种荣誉：捞起他的两只脚仔细地做了检查。

那一天好辛苦，拉上峡谷，穿过绵羊营地，经过天平山、伐木区和几百英尺深的冰川和雪谷，翻过奇尔库特分水岭——分水岭矗立在咸水和淡水之间，威严地保卫着凄凉岑寂的北国土地。他们抓紧时间穿过了一串由死火山山口形成的湖泊，晚上很晚才来到本内特湖源头的宿营地。那儿有好几千淘金客在造船，准备应付春季消融的冰雪。巴克在雪里扒开一个洞，睡了个筋疲力尽的问心无愧者的好觉，可是一大早又从冷冰冰的黑夜里被赶了出来，跟伙伴们一起套上了雪橇。

那一天路上雪橇多，他们走了四十英里；可是第二天和以后的许多天他们便只好自己开路了，行程更艰苦了，也慢了许多。佩罗特老走到雪橇队前面，用带蹼的鞋把雪踏紧，以便他们行进。法朗索瓦站在橇舵旁驾驶雪橇，偶然跟佩罗特换换工，但不频繁。佩罗特急着赶路，他也为自己掌握的有关冰的知识而自负，这种知识是绝不可少的，因为秋天的冰层很薄，水流湍急的地方是完全没有冰的。

巴克一天接一天在雪橇路上干活，日子没有穷尽。他们总是在黑暗中扎营，天蒙蒙亮时又已走了若干英里。扎营总在黑尽之后，然后吃点鱼，就爬到雪里去睡。巴克食量极大，一磅半晒干的鲑鱼是他一天的口粮，一下肚就没影儿了。他总是吃不饱，总是饿得难受，可别的狗因为体重轻些，又是生下来便过这种生活的，只吃一磅鱼也长得很好。

巴克很快便改变了过去生活特有的洁癖。他进餐很文雅，却发现伙伴们吃完了自己一份又来抢他没吃完的定量，无法抵挡。他跟两三个强盗打完仗他的鱼早进了别的强盗的肚子。为此他只好跟他们吃得一样快。又由于饿得厉害，他并不把抢夺食物看做有失体面。他观察着，学习着。他看见新来的狗派克，聪明的假病号兼小偷，趁佩罗特一转身便偷了一片腊肉，自己第二天便也如法炮制，弄到了一大块。这事引起了巨大的骚动，却没人怀疑他。而达布，一个呆头呆脑老犯错误老被抓住的家伙却因巴克干的坏事而受到处罚。

这第一次的盗窃活动是一个标志，说明他是能在北国土地上满含敌意的环境里生活下去的。这标志着他的适应能力：他能因环境变化而调整自己。没有这个本领可能意味着急速到来的可怕的死亡。它也标志了他的道德本性的蜕化与解体。那是一种虚荣，在残酷的生存斗争中是一种障碍。在南方的国土上，在爱与友情的法则之下，尊重私有财产和个人感情是不错的，但在北方的国土上，在大棒和獠牙的法律之下谁若把那类东西当回事他便是傻瓜，只要他仍然遵守那类法则他准倒霉。

巴克倒不曾思考过，他能适应，那就行了。他不知不觉地适应了新的生活方式。他这一辈子从没有临阵脱逃过，不管形势多么严峻，可是穿红绒线衫的人的大棒却把一种更为根本也更为原始的法典敲进了他的脑子里。他受过文明熏陶，他可以为了道义（比如为了卫护米勒法官的马鞭子）而从容就义，可是现在却证实他已经非文明化了，他有能力摆脱保卫道义的思想，去保住自己的性命。他偷，并不是喜欢偷，而是因为肚子在大吵大闹。他并不明抢，而是耍狡猾，悄悄地偷，那是出于对大棒和獠牙的尊重。总之，他干了他干过的事，因为干比不干好过。

他的发展（或是倒退）很快。他的肌肉变得坚如钢铁，对一般的痛苦已经满不在乎。他形成了内在和外在的能力，什么都能吃，不管多么恶心，多难消化；只要吃下去他的胃液就能从中摄取最后一滴营养，再由血液送到身体最辽远的角落，把它变成最结实最有力的身体组织。他的视觉和嗅觉敏锐得惊人，而他的听觉则敏锐到能在睡梦中听见最微弱的声音，判断出它是吉是凶。冰块冻在脚趾缝里他学会了用嘴把它咬出来；他口渴了而水洞口又有脏冰他可以站直身子用绷紧的前爪把冰敲破。他最突出的特点是能在今晚嗅出明天即将到来的风，发出预报。他在树旁或土坡边筑窝时无论那风多么平缓，等到它铺天盖地刮过来时他总是遮得严严的，舒舒服服躺在背风的方向。

一方面他从经验中学习，一方面他早已消失的本能也复活了。多少代的驯养从他身上消失了。他朦胧地记起了自己种族的青年时代。那时成群结队的野狗在原始森林里游荡，追杀着猎物充饥。对于咬啮、撕扯和豺狼式的突击他都不需要学习。早被忘却的祖先们就是这样厮杀的。祖先们使他身上古老的生命活跃起来，他们记录在种族遗传中的古老技巧便是他的技巧。这些技巧并不费事，也不用寻求便出现在他身上，仿佛他一向如此。在平静寒冷的夜晚当他把鼻子对着一颗星星发出狼一样悠长的嚎叫时，那便是他死去成灰的祖先们超越了千百年在通过他把鼻子对着星星嚎叫。他那嚎叫的抑扬顿挫便是他们的嚎叫的抑扬顿挫，其中表达了他们的苦难和他们所体味到的岑寂、寒冷和黑暗。

这样，那古老的嚎叫便激荡了他的全身，成了一种标记，说明了生命只不过是一种傀儡似的东西。于是他又恢复了自己的本性。他恢复了本性，因为人们在北方找到了一种黄色的金属，因为曼纽埃尔是个花匠的助手，而他的工资又不够养活他的老婆和他自己的几个翻版。





第三章　威风凛凛的原始动物


原始动物的强悍习性在巴克身上原很强烈，雪橇路上严酷的条件又使这种习性不断地发展了，但那发展是秘密的。他新产生的狡猾给了他平衡与控制。他调整自己以适应新的生活的速度太快，这不免使自己感到不安。他不仅不挑起争端，而且尽量避免打架。他的神态的特点是从容不迫。他没有鲁莽的倾向，从不仓促行动，对他跟斯匹茨之间的深仇大恨他没有表现丝毫急躁，对于一切能开罪斯匹茨的行动他都避免。

另一方面斯匹茨也许意识到巴克是个危险的对手，从不放过对他龇牙的机会。他甚至离开行列来欺负巴克，不断设法挑起一场你死我活的争端。

若不是因为出现了一次不平常的事件，这场争端早在这次旅行开始就出现了。这天晚上他们到达了勒巴治湖岸荒凉阴冷的宿营地。飞卷的雪片、像刀子一样犀利的风和沉沉的夜色逼得他们在摸索中寻找宿营的地点。没有比他们更倒霉的了。他们背后有一堵壁立的岩石，佩罗特和法朗索瓦不得不在湖面的冰上生火和铺上睡觉的袍子——他们为了行动轻便在岱亚就扔掉了帐篷。几根树枝给他们提供了一小堆火，火烤化了冰，熄掉了。他们只好在黑暗里进晚餐。

巴克在避风的岩石正下方扒出了自己的窝，那窝又舒服又温暖，法朗索瓦分配在火上解了冻的鱼时他可真舍不得离开。但是在巴克吃完他的定量回去时却发现他的窝被霸占了。一声狺狺的警告表明入侵者是斯匹茨。到目前为止巴克一直避免跟他的仇人冲突，但这回却太过分了，巴克胸中的兽性咆哮了。他大发雷霆扑向斯匹茨。这叫双方都吃了一惊，尤其是斯匹茨，因为他跟巴克的全部交往都告诉他他的对手特别怯懦，只不过因为身坯高大才有今天的地位罢了。

两条狗从毁坏的雪窝里厮咬着射出来时法朗索瓦也吃了一惊。他立即明白了问题的根源。“啊——啊——啊！”他对巴克叫道，“你就让给他吧，天哪！让给他吧，那不要脸的小偷！”

斯匹茨有同样的意思。他转来转去地兜着圈子，愤怒地急切地吠叫着，想找机会扑上去。巴克也同样急切，同样谨慎，也在转来转去兜圈子要寻找对方的破绽，可正在这时意外发生了。这事把双方争霸的斗争推迟到未来，到无数英里的雪路苦役之后。

佩罗特咒骂了一声，大棒敲在瘦骨嶙峋的身子上发出巨响，一声尖利的痛苦的哀鸣，宣告了一场大混战的爆发。营地上突然活动起许多毛茸茸的身影——全是些饥饿的雪橇狗，共有八九十只，他们从某个印第安人的村子里嗅到了宿营的味道，巴克和斯匹茨干仗时他们已经悄悄到来。两个人抡着大棒扑向他们，他们龇着牙反击。他们已叫食物的香味惹得发了狂。佩罗特发现一只狗把头伸进了食品箱，他的大棒落在瘦筋筋的肋骨上，食品箱翻倒在地。二十只饥饿的野兽立即争先恐后来抢面包和腊肉，大棒打在身上他们全无知觉。他们在雨点似的大棒下尖叫着咆哮着，却照样疯狂地争抢，直抢到最后一块面包渣也被吞下。

与此同时大吃一惊的雪橇狗群冲出了雪窝，但立即受到凶猛的侵略者的袭击。巴克从没见过这样的狗：嶙峋的瘦骨似乎要撑破了皮，全是骨头架子，拖湿了的皮松垮垮地吊着，眼露凶光，獠牙上挂着涎水，但是他们饿坏了，十分吓人，难以抗拒，谁也抵挡不住。一受到攻击，雪橇狗就给赶到了悬崖底下。巴克受到三条野狗的袭击，转瞬之间头和肩膀便被咬破了，撕伤了。狗吠声震耳欲聋。比利跟平时一样呜咽着；大卫和索莱克斯身上各有一二十处伤，却在勇敢地并肩作战；乔像个魔鬼一样狂咬着，有一回他的牙叼住了一只大狗的前腿，“嘣”的一声便咬断了。

装病的派克扑到一条瘸了腿的野狗身上，牙齿狠狠咬住，使劲一拧，脖子便断了。巴克一口咬住一只喷着白沫的对手的喉咙，咬破了颈静脉，鲜血喷了一身，嘴里那暖烘烘的血味刺激得他更凶猛了。他扑向了另一只狗，同时却觉得自己的咽喉给牙齿咬住了。那是斯匹茨在搞阴险的侧面突击。

佩罗特和法朗索瓦清理完自己的宿营地，急忙赶来救雪橇狗。那拨饥饿的野物又冲了回来。巴克也挣脱了身，但那只是一会儿工夫。那两个人还得回去抢救食物。野狗群又趁此来对付雪橇狗。被迫应战的比利突破了野狗的包围圈逃到了冰上。派克和达布也跟着跑，别的狗也跟了上去。巴克定了定神要跟了去，眼梢却瞥见斯匹茨向他扑来，显然想要把他摔翻。他只要倒到地上，落到那群野狗脚下就完了，但是他却在斯匹茨的冲击下站稳了脚跟，然后跟着大伙儿逃到了湖上。

于是，九条雪橇狗会合，躲到树林里去了。虽然再没有谁追，大家却一副狼狈相。没有一条狗身上没有四五处伤，有的甚至受了重伤。达布后腿伤势很重；在岱亚最后加入队伍的狗多丽喉咙严重撕伤；乔瞎了一只眼；温驯的比利一只耳朵被咬成了几条，呜呜地叫了一个通宵。天亮时他们小心翼翼地跛回营地，发现匪徒们已经走了，两个人正在发脾气。他们的食物储备足有一半已经损失。野狗把雪橇绳和帆布篷都咬破了。实际上只要稍微能吃的东西都给吃光了。他们吃了佩罗特一双麋鹿皮靴子，吃掉了好几段皮带，甚至把法朗索瓦的鞭子尾巴吃掉了两英尺。他正懊恼地思考着这些，抬起头又看见了这队伤痕累累的狗。

“啊，我的朋友们，”他温和地说，“可把你们气病了吧？那些伤。全都气疯了吧？圣母！你觉得怎么样，呃，佩罗特？”

信使意义暧昧地摇了摇头。从这儿到道森还有四百英里，若是有狗发了疯他可受不了。费了两小时的咒骂和努力终于把狗队整理好了，套上了套。伤痕累累行动不便的狗队总算出发了，痛苦地挣扎着走上他们所遇到的最艰苦的路，也是此去道森的最艰苦的路。

三十英里的河大大地敞开。它的汹涌急流不怕霜冻，只有在回水沱和平稳的地方才能结冰。要走完这可怕的三十英里需要六天的艰苦奋斗，而且危险，因为每走过一英尺人和狗都得冒生命危险。佩罗特探路，有十来次踩断了冰桥，都是靠手上的棍子救了命的——那棍子他有个拿法，一踩穿冰面棍子就横担在窟窿边上。

天气又急遽转冷，温度计低达零下五十度，他每一次掉下去都得生火烤衣服救命。

可他什么都不怕——正因为他什么都不怕才被选中做了政府信使的。他各种各样的危险都敢冒，他敢把那张满是皱纹的小脸插进冰天雪地里去。从曚昽的黎明直到天黑尽，他在形势险恶的岸边的冰面上走，那冰一踩便弯下，坼裂，使他们不敢停留。有一次雪橇压破了冰，把大卫和巴克扯了下去，冻了个半死；他们被救出冰窟窿时又几乎被淹死，照往常一样生起火才算救回了他们两条命。他们身上结了坚硬的冰块，两个人赶着他们绕着火转圈，一面出汗一面化冰。离火很近，连毛也给火苗烧焦了。

另有一次是斯匹茨掉进了冰窟窿，把全队的狗都拽了下去，一直拽到巴克。全亏巴克前爪蹬紧光滑的冰边，竭尽全力稳住，直压得四方的冰面轧轧地发抖。他后面是大卫，也竭尽全力蹬住，雪橇后面则是法朗索瓦，也用力拽住，直拽得筋都快要断了。

下一回河边的冰又是前后都已破裂，无路可走了，唯一的路是往山崖上攀登。佩罗特奇迹一样爬了上去，法朗索瓦也祈祷能创造奇迹。后来是把所有的皮带、鞭绳和最后的辔头绳结成了一根长绳，把狗一只只吊到了悬崖顶上。雪橇和行李全上去之后，法朗索瓦才最后上来。然后又寻找下山的路。最后又是靠绳子解决问题，下了山，到天黑之后他们才又绕回到了河边，一天只走了四分之一英里。

等到他们到达豪塔林夸好走的冰路上时巴克已经累坏了，别的狗也差不多，但是佩罗特为了抢时间仍然赶着他们起早贪黑地赶路。第一天赶到大鳜鱼，走了三十五英里；第二天走到小鳜鱼又走了三十五英里。第三天走了四十英里，已靠近了五指山。

巴克的脚不如其他的雪橇狗结实耐磨，自从他若干代前的野狗祖宗被穴居人或河边人驯养以来他的脚已经软化了。他整天痛苦地跛着脚走路，一宿营就躺下，像死了一样。他虽然很饿，法朗索瓦送来他那份定量鱼时，他却懒得起身去吃。每天晚饭后那赶狗的还来给他按摩半小时脚掌，又牺牲了自己鹿皮靴的靴筒给他做了四只鹿皮鞋，他这才好受多了。有天早上法朗索瓦忘了给他穿鹿皮鞋，巴克便躺在地上四脚乱踢，赖着不动，连佩罗特也咧开皱巴巴的脸上的大嘴笑了。后来脚长硬了，可以在雪地上跋涉了，那四只破烂的鹿皮鞋才扔掉。

有天早上在佩里岛，大家正在套辔头，一向并不惹眼的达利突然发起疯来。她发出一声悠长凄厉的狼嚎，宣布了自己的病情。这声嚎叫让所有的狗都吓得乍了毛，然后她便直向巴克扑去，巴克没见过狗发疯，也没有理由害怕，但却明白出了可怕的事，吓得落荒而逃。

他在前面跑，达利喘着气喷着白沫在后面追，前后只有一跳可及的距离，可她却赶不上，因为巴克太害怕；而巴克也无法摆脱她，因为她太疯狂。巴克穿过了岛上的树林，往下跑到岛的尾部，跑过岛后一条冰块林立的小沟，上了另一个岛，又上了第三个岛，再绕回了主河道，被逼得紧了又想逃过河去。在整个逃跑过程中他虽然没有回头看，却一直听见她狂吠着紧追在身后一跃可及的地方。法朗索瓦在半英里外叫他，他又绕了回来，仍然只有一跃的距离。他跑得苦苦喘气，一心只相信法朗索瓦可以救他。那狗夫攥着一把斧头，巴克刚一窜过，斧头就砸到了达利头上。

巴克摇摇晃晃靠近雪橇站定，喘着气，呜咽着，已经筋疲力尽，无可奈何了。这可是斯匹茨的好机会。他跳到了巴克背上，对他无法招架的对手连咬了两口，直咬到骨头，撕开了肉。

这时法朗索瓦的鞭子落了下来，巴克心满意足地看到斯匹茨挨了一顿队里任何狗也没挨过的狠揍。

“是个魔鬼，那个斯匹茨，”佩罗特说，“总有一天他会杀了巴克的。”

“那巴克也是个魔鬼，”法朗索瓦回答，“我一直在研究他，我心里有数。我说，总有一天他会他妈的发起狂来，把斯匹茨吃掉，把骨头吐到雪地上，我肯定。”

从此以后他俩便干仗。斯匹茨是排头狗，狗队公认的领袖，他感到这头南方来的奇怪的狗威胁着他至高无上的地位。在他眼里巴克很奇怪，因为他见过许多南方狗，没有一条在营地或雪路上有过良好表现，全都太娇气，全都是叫劳累、冰雪和饥饿折磨死的，而巴克却例外。只有他经受住了，而且跟雪橇狗比力气，比野蛮，比狡猾，表现出了自己的分量。更危险的是，他很有自制力，那穿红绒线衫的人的大棒把他那要想出人头地的欲望所产生的盲目勇气和鲁莽打掉了。他狡猾得超凡脱俗，能够以近乎原始的耐性忍受一切。

争夺领导权的斗争已是无可避免。巴克正需要这场斗争。他需要，因为那是他的本性，因为他为雪橇路上那种难以理解的无名的自豪感紧紧攫住了——那种使狗们在劳动中坚持下去，在狗轭下欢欢喜喜地死去，若是把他们从狗轭下赶走，他们还会伤心而死的感情。这也是大卫作为辕狗的自豪感，是使索莱克斯竭力苦干的自豪感，是狗群一从营地出发便激励着他们，使这群脾气古怪、怒气冲冲的野兽变做奋发努力、斗志昂扬的生物的自豪感。它白天全天使他们前进，晚上宿营后使他们无聊不安、心怀不满。这是支持斯匹茨惩罚犯了错误、工作偷懒或是早上上套时躲起来的狗的自豪感，同样，这也正是使他害怕巴克会成为排头狗的自豪感；而这，也正是巴克的自豪感。

巴克公开地威胁起对方的领袖地位来。他插到斯匹茨和要被惩罚的懒家伙之间，而且是故意的。有天晚上下大雪，到了早上，爱装病的派克却不见了，躲在一英尺厚的雪下的窝里睡大觉。法朗索瓦四处找他，叫他，都找不到。斯匹茨气得发狂，在营地上匆匆地跑，在一切可能的地方嗅，刨，狠命地咆哮。派克听见了便躲着发抖。

可是等到终于把他刨了出来斯匹茨向他扑去时，巴克却怀着同样的愤怒插到了他俩之间。这一招很出意外，又来得如此巧妙，竟把斯匹茨撞回去，翻了个筋斗。刚才还可耻地发着抖的派克一见这公开的兵变便来了劲，向他被推翻的领袖扑去。早已忘掉了公平竞争法则的巴克也对斯匹茨扑了上去，可是眼见这番事变忍不住笑却仍然铁面无私的法朗索瓦早已一鞭子狠狠地抽到巴克身上。鞭子并没有挡住巴克扑向他已经落地的对手，于是又使用起了鞭杆子，一杆子把巴克打得几乎昏死过去，他被赶了回去，鞭子又不断落到他身上。这时斯匹茨便对一再调皮捣蛋的派克进行了严惩。

道森越走越近了，在以后的日子里巴克仍总在斯匹茨执行惩罚时插上一手，可是他干得巧妙，总是拣法朗索瓦不在场的时候出马。由于巴克这种隐秘的兵变，一种不受管束的情绪普遍出现而且蔓延滋长。大卫和索莱克斯虽没受影响，但队里别的狗却越来越难办。形势不稳定了，斗殴争吵老是出现，老是出问题，而那背后则老是巴克。他让法朗索瓦应接不暇，因为狗夫总担心两者之间会出现生死搏斗——他知道那早晚是免不了的。好多个晚上他都为别的狗的争吵斗殴惊醒，从皮袍下翻身爬起，怕的是巴克跟斯匹茨干起来。

但是机会总未出现，于是直到他们在一个阴沉沉的下午到达道森为止，那场大战还不曾爆发。道森有许多人，也有无数的狗，巴克发现他们都在工作。好像狗都是天意命定要干活儿似的。狗们成天排成长队在大街上奔跑，入夜以后狗铃仍然四处叮当。他们拉着造房子用的木料和柴火往矿山里送，干着各种在圣克拉拉峡谷里该由马干的活儿。巴克也遇见过南方狗，但大部分是野狼式的雪橇狗。每天晚上九点、十二点和三点他们都要夜嚎，那是一种凄凉怪诞、叫人毛骨悚然的调子，巴克很高兴跟着一起嚎。

北极光在头顶辉耀，发出寒冷的火焰；星星起伏摇曳，跳着霜冻之舞，土地被积雪的尸衣冻僵了。在这样的环境下，这种雪橇狗的悲歌可能是一种对生命的挑战，只是调子却很低沉，半是悠长的叹息，半是哽噎；更可能是对生活的抗议。清楚地哀叹着生之辛劳。那是一首古老的歌曲，古老如狗的种族——是最早的歌曲之一，那时地球还年轻，歌声也总是凄苦，带有无数个世代的哀伤。奇怪的是巴克总是为那哀声所激动。他的嚎叫哽咽之中带着生的痛苦，也是他远古时代野蛮的祖先的痛苦；带着对寒冷与黑暗的恐惧和迷惘，也是他祖先的恐惧和迷惘。这种悲歌能震动他，就说明他是在火与屋顶的时代响应着鸿蒙初辟时的生命的嚎叫。

进入道森七天之后，他们又沿着巴拉克山陡峭的山坡下到了育空河雪路，往岱亚和盐水河方向前进。佩罗特投送的急件比过去任何时候送过的都紧急，而他又怀有一种急递的自豪感。要想创造出全年最快的投递记录。他有好几个有利条件：一个礼拜的休息已经恢复了狗队的体力，使他们一个个精神焕发。他们开辟的雪径已经为后来的旅客们压实了。警察局又在两三处地方储藏了狗和人的给养，因此他们可以轻装前进。

第一天他们走了五十英里，到达了一个叫“六十英里”的地方。第二天他们溯育空河而上，在去佩利的路上走了很长的距离，但是这样出色的进度并非没有给法朗索瓦带来巨大的不便和烦恼。巴克领导的阴险的叛变已经破坏了狗队的团结。狗队在雪径上再也不是像一只狗那样跳跃前进了。巴克对叛逆者的鼓励使他们做下种种违法乱纪的事。斯匹茨再也不是威风凛凛的领袖，往日对他的敬畏消失了，狗群要跟他闹平等，向他的权威挑战。有天晚上派克抢了他半条鱼，在巴克的保护之下吞了下去。另一个晚上达布和乔跟斯匹茨干了一仗，使他放弃了应给他们的惩罚。就连一向温驯的比利也不那么温驯了，哀求起来还不如以前一半可怜。巴克一到斯匹茨身边便龇着牙咆哮，耸起鬣毛示威。这种行为实际上使他成了个暴徒，而他又常在斯匹茨面前大摇大摆地走来走去。

纪律一涣散，狗与狗之间的关系也受到影响。他们经常吵嘴打架，弄得营地嚎成一片，像个疯人院。只有大卫和索莱克斯依然故我，尽管没完没了的吵闹也弄得他们心烦。法朗索瓦发出野蛮的怪骂，大发脾气，在雪地上顿脚，却也全无作用，只好揪自己的头发。他的鞭子永远在狗群间呼啸，却无济于事。他一转身狗群又干起仗来。他用鞭子给斯匹茨撑腰，巴克却给别的狗撑腰。法朗索瓦知道他是一切混乱的后台，巴克也知道他知道，但巴克太聪明，再也不会被他现场拿获了。他在辔头下工作得很忠实，因为劳动已成了他的一种快乐。但是幕后作祟，在伙伴中挑起斗争，让雪橇皮带乱成一团却给他更大的快乐。

有一天晚饭后，达布在塔吉纳河口赶出了一只雪鞋兔[1]，却没逮住，让它跑掉了。顷刻之间全队的狗都放开嗓门狂吠起来。一百码外有个西北警局驻地，养有五十只雪橇狗，便也来跟着追。那兔飞快跑下河岸，来到小河，河面冻结了，雪鞋兔稳稳重重上了河面，在雪上轻松地跳着，狗群则要花很大的力气在雪里奔跑。巴克带着一支六十只狗的大军一个河湾一个河湾地跟着追，却追不上。他放低身子迫切地吠着，让自己漂亮的身形在微弱的白茫茫的月色中一纵一纵地闪着光前进，像个霜冻的白色幽灵。

那种古老的本能的冲动，那种在固定的时期把人从喧嚣的城市驱赶到森林和平原上用化学力驱使的子弹去杀死生灵的冲动，那种嗜血的欲望和因杀戮而获得的欢乐——这一切都出现在巴克身上。只是那种感觉要直接得多，真切得多。他在狗群前飞跑，想要赶上前面的野物，那活着的食品，想用自己的牙把它咬死，用温暖的血泼洒自己的鼻头，也洒向眼睛。

这里有一种标志着生命极致的狂欢极乐之感，那是生命所无法超越的，却也是一种生活的悖论：这狂欢在生命最活跃的时刻降临，而它的降临却使人忘却了生命。这种欢乐，这种对生命的遗忘进入艺术家的心里，便以艺术家为燃料燃烧成艺术的烈火，进入酣战的战场便让杀红了眼的士兵手下毫不留情，而此时这种欢乐也进入了巴克心中。巴克带着狗群，发出狼一样的古老的嚎叫紧追着月光中在他面前飞跑的鲜活的食物。他从天性深处发出吠叫，从天性中比他还要深沉的部分发出吠叫，那吠叫直通回时间的子宫里去。支配他的是生命的激浪，是存在的潮汐，是每一块肌肉、每一个关节和每一条筋腱所感到的欢乐。它是一切有生之伦的欢乐，它光焰灼灼，横流放肆，在行动之中表现自己，在星光下寂然不动的事物上欢快地飞翔。

但是盛怒之下也能保持冷静和工于心计的斯匹茨此时却离开了狗群，在小河绕大湾处的狭窄陆地上横切了过来。巴克对此却一无所知，他沿着河湾跑时，那兔的霜雪般的精灵还在他前面疾跑。他看见另一个更大的霜雪精灵从倒悬的崖壁上直接跳到了兔子的路上，那是斯匹茨。兔子已没了退路，白色的牙在半空咬断了它的背脊时它发出了一声人类一样的凄厉的尖叫。一听见这声音，这生命被死亡攫住从生命的高峰猛然坠落的声音，巴克身后的狗群发出了地狱一样的欢乐的合唱。

巴克没有叫。他并未停步，而是对准斯匹茨直扑上去，两条狗肩并肩，他又用力太猛，竟没咬住斯匹茨的咽喉。他们在飞扬的雪粉中滚来滚去。斯匹茨几乎像没被扑倒一样翻身爬了起来反咬了巴克一口，立即跳开了。他的牙两次像捕兽机的钢颚一样咬得嗒嗒作响，同时往后退了几步站稳脚跟，它那瘦而掀起的嘴唇抽搐着发出咆哮。

顷刻之间，巴克已意识到你死我活的时刻已经来到。他们兜着圈子咆哮着，双耳后倒，敏锐地寻找着有利时机。那情景给了巴克一种似曾相识之感。他似乎全记得——白色的森林，白色的土地，月光和战斗的刺激。一阵鬼魅样的平静笼罩着寂寂的白野。没有半丝风的细语——没有一点动作，没有一片叶子的颤抖。狗群的喘息在霜冻的空气里缓缓上升并凝滞，明显可见。雪鞋兔顷刻间就给吃了个精光。现在狗们又围成了一个圆圈守候着。他们是尚未驯服的狼。他们也一声不响，只有眼睛闪着荧荧的光，呼出的气缓缓上升。在巴克眼里这个古老的场面毫不新鲜，也并不奇怪，它是事物的常规，一向如此。

斯匹茨是个久经考验的战将。斯匹茨从贝根到北极横穿加拿大和巴林诸岛，他在各种各样的狗面前都站稳了脚跟，取得了胜利，成了他们的主宰。他满腔怒火，可绝不因而盲目。他感情冲动，想撕咬，想破坏，可他从没忘记他的对手也是感情冲动，想撕咬，想破坏。他在无把握对付冲击之前绝不冲击，在准备好自卫之前从不进攻。

巴克总想把牙咬进那条大白狗的脖子里，却总失败。他的牙总在想遇上柔软的肉的地方遇上斯匹茨獠牙的反噬。獠牙跟獠牙相碰撞，咬破了嘴唇，流血了，但巴克却无法突破对手的防线。于是他兴奋起来，围着斯匹茨发动了一连串旋风式的冲击。他一次又一次扑向那雪白的咽喉，那是生命的搏动最接近表皮的地方。可是他每一次每一回都遭到斯匹茨的反击，而且让他跳开了。于是巴克装出向喉头冲击的样子，却突然一缩头，侧身一转，用肩头向斯匹茨的肩头猛击，想把他撞翻，可是他的肩头每次冲击过去时斯匹茨都轻轻地跳开了。

斯匹茨安然无恙，巴克却已鲜血淋漓，气喘吁吁。战斗越来越不顾死活，而在整个过程中一声不响的狼一样的圆圈却在等着把倒下者吃个精光。巴克开始喘气，斯匹茨却开始了进攻，攻得他常常立足不稳。有一次巴克倒了下去，于是周围的六十只狗都扑了上来；可他却几乎蹦到了半空，然后站住了。那圈狗又退出去等着。

但是，巴克具有一种可以通向伟大的品质，他有想象力。他凭本领战斗，可他也能用脑袋战斗。他冲上前去，仿佛又要玩撞肩头的把戏，却在最后一瞬间一猫身子钻进了雪里，用牙咬住了斯匹茨的左前腿。骨头碎裂之声传来，那条白狗便只能靠三条腿来对付他了。巴克又是三次撞击，想把他撞倒，接着又重复了刚才的花样，咬断了他的右前腿。斯匹茨忍住疼痛和无可奈何，疯狂地斗争着，力图稳住。他看了看目光荧荧、舌头吊出、呼出的银色气息袅袅升腾的一圈狗向自己围了拢来，正如当初他看见类似的一圈狗向被自己战败的对手围上去一样，可这一次战败的却是自己。

他没有希望了。巴克冷酷无情。怜悯是保留给较为温和的气候的。狗的圈子越缩越小，巴克能感到雪橇狗的鼻息吹到自己腰上，能看到斯匹茨身后两侧的狗眼睛紧盯住他，已经半蹲下身子准备扑上去。时间似乎出现了短暂的停顿。全部牲畜都凝固了，宛若化做了石头。只有斯匹茨竖起了毛在发抖，他已站立不稳，时而前倾，时而后倒。他发出可怕的咆哮，表示威胁，仿佛想赶走迎面逼来的死亡。

巴克蹦了进来，又跳了出去，蹦进去时肩头对着肩头一撞。黑的圆圈在泻满月光的雪地上聚结成了一个黑点。斯匹茨消失了。巴克站在一旁看着，那胜利者，那威风凛凛的原始动物形成了自己的技巧并发现它能够奏效。

第四章　霸权谁属


“呃？我说过吧？我说过那巴克是个双料魔鬼吧！我可是说对了。”

法朗索瓦第二天早上发现斯匹茨不见了，而巴克则遍体鳞伤。他把巴克弄到火堆边，靠着火光指出了伤口。

“那斯匹茨打起架来可厉害得像地狱。”佩罗特一边说，一边检查着大大小小的伤口。

“可这巴克打起架来就厉害得像双料地狱。”法朗索瓦回答，“咱们现在清静了，没有了斯匹茨也就没有了纠纷。”

佩罗特收拾营帐什物，捆上雪橇，狗夫开始套狗。巴克快步赶到斯匹茨作为排头狗应当占有的位置；可是法朗索瓦没有注意到他，却带来了索莱克斯，让他占有了那令人眼红的位置。他认为索莱克斯是现有的狗中最好的。巴克大发雷霆扑向索莱克斯，赶走了他，站到他的位置上。

“怎么，怎么？”法朗索瓦乐了，拍着大腿说，“你看那巴克，杀了斯匹茨，想补他的缺呢！”

“滚开，笨蛋！”他叫道，但是巴克不肯动。

他抓住巴克颈皮，那狗虽威胁地叫着，却被他拽到了一边，换上了索莱克斯。老狗并不喜欢这个位置，显然表示害怕巴克。法朗索瓦坚持，可是他一转身巴克又代替了索莱克斯。索莱克斯丝毫也没有不愿意的意思。

法朗索瓦生气了。“上帝！看我收拾你！”他攥了根棍子走了过来。

巴克想起了穿红绒线衣的人，慢慢退却了。索莱克斯第二次被带了上去。巴克也不进攻了，却在大棒势力范围之外转圈子，又委屈、又愤怒地汪汪大叫。他一边兜圈子，一边盯着大棒，万一法朗索瓦打来他好躲开，因为他在大棒问题上已经长了见识。

狗夫继续干活，他叫巴克，打算把他安排到大卫前面的老位置上。巴克倒退了两三步，法朗索瓦逼了上去，巴克见他来，便又倒退。相持了一会儿法朗索瓦扔下了大棒，以为巴克是怕挨揍，但是巴克却是公开造反。他要的不是不挨揍，而是排头权。那是他挣来的，不给他他可不答应。

佩罗特也来帮忙。两人一起跟他缠了大半个钟头。他们向他扔棍子，他躲开了。他们咒骂他，咒骂他的爹和娘，咒骂他的子孙万代，咒骂他身上的每一根毛、血管里的每一滴血。他以咆哮回答咒骂，却总不让他们靠近。他并不打算逃掉，只在营地上兜来兜去，清清楚楚表明只要满足他的要求他就会听话，而且做个好狗。

法朗索瓦坐下来抓脑袋。佩罗特看着表咒骂。时间在飞逝，他们一个小时以前就该上路了。法朗索瓦又抓脑袋。他摇了摇头，对着信使不好意思地苦笑，信使耸耸肩表示他俩失败了。于是法朗索瓦走到索莱克斯站着的地方叫巴克。巴克笑了起来（跟别的狗的笑法一样），却站得远远的。法朗索瓦解掉索莱克斯的皮带，让他回到他的老地方去。狗队全都套好套，一字儿排开了，准备出发。除了在最前面巴克没有别的位置可去。法朗索瓦又叫他，巴克又笑，可仍然躲得远远的。

“把棒子扔掉。”佩罗特命令道。

法朗索瓦扔掉棒子，巴克立即跑了过来，胜利地笑着，绕到排头。他的皮带系好，雪橇出发了，两人跑着，队伍冲了出去，走上河边的雪橇路。

虽然狗夫对巴克早有评价，说他是双料魔鬼，可是出发不久他才发现他还是低估了他。巴克忽然崛起，肩起了领导重任，凡是需要做出判断、迅速思考、立即行动的地方他的表现都超过了斯匹茨。法朗索瓦还从没见过能比得上他的。

但巴克出类拔萃之处却表现在执行纪律时要求伙伴们守法上。大卫和索莱克斯对于领导的更迭并不在意，那跟他们无关。他们的责任是干活儿，在队伍里使劲干活儿。只要不干扰他们，无论出了什么事他们都不管。温驯的比利可以按要求干活，只要秩序正常。可是队里别的狗已在斯匹茨的最后几天里养成了不守规矩的习惯，现在巴克却来咬他们，让他们守规矩，这叫他们大吃了一惊。

派克的位置在巴克身后，除非无可奈何他是从来不肯在胸带上多使一分劲的。现在却立即一再因吊儿郎当挨揍。一天没过完他已比这辈子任何时候都卖劲了。第一晚宿营，脾气刁钻的乔就给狠狠地揍了一顿——那是斯匹茨从来没办到的事。巴克全凭个子大压得他喘不过气来，他先是汪汪乱叫，后来只好呜呜地求饶，算是服了。

狗队的情绪立即昂扬起来，又恢复了往日的团结一致，又像一条狗一样在雪原橇径上跳跃前进了。到了林克滩又增加了两只当地的雪橇狗。巴克管教和制服这两条狗之神速真叫法朗索瓦目瞪口呆。

“巴克这样的狗，没见过！”他叫道，“没有，没有见过！值一千块，天哪！是吗？你怎么看，佩罗特？”

佩罗特点点头。他的速度已经打破了记录，而且一天一天增加。雪原橇路情况极佳，踏得结结实实，没有新雪碍事，又不太冷，气温降到零下五十度之后，在整个行程中就再也没变。两人轮流跑步和驾驶雪橇，赶着狗队飞跑，只出现过极偶然的耽误。

三十英里河冰层比较厚，用十天才能走完的路，只用一天就跑了出去。他们从勒巴治湖一口气跑了六十英里，来到了白马滩。经过了马煦、泰吉希和本内特，飞快地跑过了七十英里的湖区。原来轮到跑前面的人，后来尽被扔到后面，用一根绳拖着跑。第二周的最末一夜他们已爬上了白关，沿着斯卡格卫灯塔照耀的海岸斜坡往下冲。脚下已是海运港口了。

这番好跑跑破了记录。连续十四天每天平均四十英里。佩罗特和法朗索瓦在斯卡格卫大街上连续三天趾高气扬地。人们像潮水一样拥来请他们喝酒。狗队成了驯狗师、爱狗人徘徊欣赏流连不去的地点。然后从西边来了几个坏蛋，想把村里人的钱赢光，玩了一番手脚，却叫人抓住把柄，揭了个百孔千疮。人们的兴趣转向了新的偶像。然后公家又发出新的命令。法朗索瓦把巴克叫到身边，双手搂住他哭了一场，法朗索瓦和佩罗特便从此在巴克的生命中消失，跟别的人一样。

一个苏格兰混血儿接管了他和他的伙伴们，带着他们跟十来支狗队一起开始踏上了回道森去的漫漫长途。现在可不是轻松的欢跑，也不再创记录，只有每天拖着沉重的邮件艰难地跋涉。因为那是个邮件专列，把消息从世界各地带给在北极的阴云下寻找黄金的人。

巴克不喜欢这种工作，可是工作仍然做得不错，他跟大卫和索莱克斯一样，以工作自豪，而且让每个伙伴承担公平的劳动，不管他们是否引以自豪。生活很单调，很有规律，但很机械。每一天的情况大体相同。早上厨工上班，生火，吃早饭。然后有的人撤营帐，有的人套狗，赶在预告黎明即将到来的黑暗前一小时左右出发。晚上宿营。有人搭帐篷，有人劈柴，砍松枝搭床。有人给厨工提水或取水，还要喂狗。这是狗群一天之中唯一的乐事，虽然吃完鱼跟别的狗一起逛上个把小时也挺不错。一共有一百多条狗，其中有的打架很凶，但是巴克跟三只最厉害的狗分别作战之后便成了霸主。他一乍毛一龇牙，那几条狗便逃之夭夭。

也许他最喜爱的事便是坐在篝火边，前腿前伸，后腿蜷缩，抬头对着火光，矇矇眬眬地眨眼。有时他想起阳光普照的圣克拉拉峡谷里米勒法官的大屋子，也想起那水泥游泳池，想起墨西哥多毛狗伊萨伯尔和日本哈叭狗土次，可他回忆得更多的却是那穿红绒线衫的人、鬈毛的死、跟斯匹茨的血战和他吃过或喜欢吃的东西。阳光的国土已经很模糊，很遥远，回忆它对他已没有什么吸引力。有吸引力得多的倒是他遗传中的记忆，这种记忆给了许多他从未见过的东西以一种似曾相识之感；本能（其实就是祖先的回忆转化而成的习惯），那后来已泯灭的本能在他身上苏醒了过来，活跃了起来。

有时他蹲在那儿，对着火焰矇矇眬眬眨眼时依稀感到的是另一堆火，他看到蹲在篝火前的不是那个混血厨师，而是另一个人，这人下肢更短，双臂更长，筋络条条，肌肉呈块状，而不是平滑地鼓起。这人一头蓬松的长发，双眼以上的额部往后倒，被头发遮住。他发出奇怪的声音，似乎异常害怕黑暗，不断往黑暗里探视。他手上攥着一根棍子，一块巨大的石头牢牢固定在棍子一头。双手下垂到膝盖与脚掌之间。他差不多全身赤裸，一片叫火烤焦了的褴褛的毛皮挂在背上，身上有许多毛。有些地方毛很长：前胸、双肩、双臂直到大腿两侧，几乎就是大片大片的裘皮。这人身子并不直立，而是自腰以上略微向前躬着，双腿在膝盖处弯曲。他的身子有一种特别的弹性，或者叫做恢复原状的能力，几乎像猫；还有一种敏感警惕，仿佛永远生活在对已看见和没看见的事物的恐惧之中。

这毛人有时蹲在火前，脑袋俯向双腿睡觉，这时他手肘支在膝上，双手抱头，仿佛要用长着毛的双臂遮住雨水。而在火光之外，在周围的黑暗中，巴克可以看到许多亮晶晶的火光，一对一对的火光，永远是一对一对的火光。他知道那是大型猛兽的眼睛。他可以听见他们的身子走过压折了地面的植物在夜里发出的声音。巴克在育空河常用懒洋洋的眼睛望着火光做梦时，这些来自另一个世界的声音常使他背上的毛倒竖，然后传到双肩和脖子，直到他低声地压抑地呜咽起来，或是发出轻微的咆哮。这时那混血儿厨师便对他叫道：“嘿，巴克，醒醒！”于是，那另一个世界便消失，现实世界又回到他的眼里。他站起身子，伸伸懒腰，打个哈欠，仿佛刚睡了一觉。

拖着邮件的行程很苦，沉重的工作把他们拖垮了。到达道森时狗群全已十分瘦弱，至少应该休息十天或是一周，但是刚过了两天他们又已离开巴拉克斯下了育空河岸，拉着写给外面的书信。狗很累，赶狗的也抱怨，更糟的是，每天都下雪。下雪意味着路面软，橇板摩擦力增大，拖起来更费力，但是赶狗的仍然全力以赴，对动物也尽心尽力。

每天晚上先要服侍的是狗。狗比赶狗的先用餐，不检查完自己的每条狗的脚，没有人能盖上袍子睡觉，可狗群的体力仍然在下降。入冬以后他们已拖着雪橇跑了一千八百英里的漫漫长途。一千八百英里，就连最结实的狗也是吃不消的，巴克却承受住了，带着伙伴们完成了任务，坚持了纪律，虽然他自己也疲惫不堪。比利每天晚上都在睡梦中吠叫哀哭。乔的脾气比任何时候都坏，索莱克斯不准任何东西靠近，无论是从瞎眼的一面或是另一面。

最痛苦的是大卫。他出了问题，更忧郁了，也更容易发脾气了。一宿营他便钻进窝里，要狗夫到窝前去喂他。只要卸下了套他就不肯起来，要第二天早上上套时才动弹。走在路上，因雪橇突然停下或重新起动而使了劲他总要痛得直叫。狗夫做了检查，却没发现什么。狗夫们对他全都很关心。用餐时也讨论，就寝前抽最后一袋烟时也琢磨。有天晚上还开了个研讨会。把他从窝里带到了篝火边，这里按按，那里戳戳，让他叫了多少回。身子里是有毛病，可是没发现有骨折。问题没找出来。

到达卡西亚沙洲时，他已非常虚弱，拉着皮带多次倒下。苏格兰混血儿停住橇队把他撤了出来，让他身后的索莱克斯递补了他的位置，叫他跟在雪橇后面跑，得到点休息。他虽然病得厉害，却不肯离队，下套时呜呜汪汪地乱叫，在看到索莱克斯替补了他曾工作过许久的地位时很伤心地哀号了起来。橇位和雪径是他的骄傲，虽然病得要死，眼看别人接替他的工作他仍然受不了。

雪橇出发之后他在橇辙后松软的雪里挣扎着跑，用牙攻击索莱克斯。他冲击他，要把他掀翻到路边去。他竭力想跳进他的皮带里，站到他和雪橇之间；他一直呜咽、狂吠、呐喊。混血儿用鞭子赶他走，但是尽管鞭子像刀扎，他仍然不管不顾，而那人却不忍心抽得更重了。他不肯轻轻松松跟在雪橇后面沿着橇辙不声不响地跑。他在柔软的雪上跑个不停，尽管那非常吃力，直跑到他筋疲力尽，倒了下去，躺在那儿凄惨地号叫着。这时长长的橇队便从他的身边飞卷而过。

他使出了残余的力气跟着雪橇跑着，直到橇队再次停下。这时他又挣扎着走过许多雪橇来到自己的位置，站到索莱克斯身边。他的狗夫从身后的人借了个火点上烟斗，让他站了一会儿，这才回去赶狗出发。狗队上了路，拉起来却意外地轻松，他们不安地回头一看，都吃了一惊，站住了。狗夫也吃了一惊：雪橇没有动。他叫伙伴们看看情况。原来大卫把索莱克斯的两根皮带都咬断了，站回了雪橇前面自己的岗位。

他用眼光请求让他留在那儿。狗夫很为难。他的伙伴说，有的狗因为工作太重被解除了职务却伤心而死。又举出他们知道的例证说有的狗因为年老或受了伤不能工作，却因被解除了橇带伤心而死。他们也感到不忍心，大卫既然上套不上套都不免一死，倒不如让他死在岗位上心里倒好过些，于是又给他上了套。他又像往日那样骄傲地拖起雪橇来，虽然他多次因为体内的伤痛而不由自主地哀号。他好几次都倒了下去，被拖着前进，有一回还叫雪橇从他身上碾过，压瘸了一条后腿，成了跛子。

但是，他仍然坚持到达了宿营地。狗夫给他在火边安排了一个地点。早上他已没有力气上路了。上套时他想来到狗夫身边，只抽搐着站起身子，摇晃了一下，又倒下了。他终于慢慢爬到了伙伴们上套的地方，瘸着腿，想伸出前腿去上套。他挣扎，伸腿，拖着身子做出上套的样子，但没了力气。他的伙伴们看他最后一眼时，他躺在雪地上喘气，渴望着跟他们走，可是他们只能听见他哀哀的号叫，直到他们绕过了河边一道森林。

橇队却停住了。苏格兰混血儿慢慢地回到了他们刚离开的营地。人们停止了谈话，一声枪响，那人又匆匆走了回来。鞭声重新响起，狗铃快活地叮当响着，雪橇队在橇径上飞驰，但是巴克明白河边那一排树后面所发生的事情。别的狗也全明白。





第五章　雪路苦役


盐水邮橇队离开道森之后三十天到达了斯卡格卫。巴克和他的伙伴们拉第一橇领路。到达后情况很糟，筋疲力尽，十分衰弱。巴克从一百四十磅瘦成了一百一十五磅。伙伴们虽然体型较小，相对减重却比他还厉害。装病的派克平生装过多少次腿疼，都很成功，这一回却真瘸了。索莱克斯跛着腿走，达布忍受着肩胛骨扭伤的痛苦。

每一条狗都痛，跳不起蹦不动了。走一步扭一下，爪子落地十分沉重，一天的路带来两天的疲倦，但除了疲倦得要命，他们却没有其他问题。那不是吃力的短期苦役所造成的只需几个小时就可以过去的倦怠，而是连续数月缓慢长期的苦作所造成的过度疲劳。再也没有恢复体力的能力，再也没有后备力量可以使用，连最后的一点力气都用光了。每一块肌肉，每一根纤维，每一个细胞都疲倦了，疲倦得要死。这倒是必然的。在不到五个月的时间里他们的行程已达二千五百英里，其中最后的一千八百英里跑完之后他们只休息了五天，到达斯卡格卫时他们显然已经站不住了。皮带勉强拉紧，下坡时勉强躲开了雪橇的撞击。

“坚持，可怜的痛脚们，”他们颤颤巍巍走过斯卡格卫大街时狗夫给他们打气，“是最后一段路了。然后就休息好多天，行不？我保证，休息好多天。”

狗夫们有把握可以休息很久。他们自己走过一千二百英里也只休息了两天。从道理和常识说来他们也值得休息几天。可是拥进克朗代克河地区的人太多，而没有拥进来的情人、老婆、亲人又远在他乡，因此邮件堆积得像阿尔卑斯山，于是政府又下达了命令。一批批哈德逊湾的新狗即将取代无法上路的狗。没用的狗要淘汰。既然钱比狗重要，狗就要被卖掉。

三天过去了。在这三天里巴克和他的伙伴们明白了他们疲倦到了什么程度。第四天早上来了两个美国人，没花几个钱就把他们连辔头全买去了。那两个人彼此称呼为“哈尔”和“查尔斯”。查尔斯是个中年人，肤色很淡，眼里潮湿，目光软弱，唇髭却凶狠有力地翘起，跟它遮住的软沓沓的嘴唇表情相反。哈尔是个十九或二十岁的小青年，挂了一把科尔特连发大手枪，皮带上插了一把猎刀，还威风凛凛挂满了子弹。这说明了他的幼稚——一种地道的说不清道不明的幼稚。两个人都显然没有职业。

这样的人为什么到北方来冒险，是个无法回答的谜。巴克听见讲价，看见那人把钱交给政府人员，便知道那苏格兰混血儿和邮橇的其他狗夫也要随着佩罗特、法朗索瓦和其他已消失的人从他的生活里消失。巴克跟伙伴们一起被赶到新主人帐篷时，看见的是一种凑凑合合马马虎虎的局面。帐篷只撑起一半，盘子没洗，一切都乱七八糟。他还看见一个女人。他们叫她梅西蒂斯。她是查尔斯的妻子和哈尔的姐姐——好一个家庭集团！

巴克忧心忡忡地望着他们拆卸帐篷，拴上雪橇。他们看来很卖力，却缺少办事的方法。帐篷打成的包有一般能打成的三倍大。洋铁皮盘子没洗就打进了行李。梅西蒂斯老在男人面前瞎忙，唧唧喳喳说个不停，不是反对，就是出主意。他们把衣服口袋放到雪橇前面，她却建议放到后面，等到放到后面再用两三个包裹压上，她却发现了几件原来被忽略的东西，别的地方都不能放，只能放到那只袋里，只好又把它卸下来。

附近一个帐篷出来了三个人，在一旁看着，笑着，彼此递着眼色。

“像现在这样你们就挺不错的，”其中一个说，“你们的事我本不该多嘴，可我若是你们是不会把帐篷带上的。”

“那可是做梦也想不到的事，”梅西蒂斯叫道，两手向上一挥做出优美的姿态，表示惊讶，“没有帐篷我怎么过呢？”

“春天到了，不会再冷了。”那人回答。

她坚定地摇了摇头，查尔斯和哈尔把最后一批七零八碎的东西收拾到堆积如山的行李上去。

“你以为这样能走吗？”一个人问。

“为什么不能？”查尔斯简短地质问。

“啊，行了行了，”那人连忙规规矩矩地说，“我只不过瞎猜想猜想而已。好像有点上重下轻呢。”

查尔斯转过身用尽全力再抽了抽绳子，却无丝毫改进。

“当然，狗总会拉着那堆玩艺儿走上一整天的。”另一个肯定。

“当然。”哈尔彬彬有礼却冷冷地说，一手抓住舵棍，一手摇着鞭子。“呣！”他叫道，“呣，那边！”

狗队猛力顶着胸带奋斗了一会儿，却又松了劲——拉不动。

“懒东西，我教训教训他们。”他叫道，打算一鞭子抽出去。

可是梅西蒂斯却来干预了。她叫道：“啊，哈尔，别打。”她抓住鞭子，从他手里夺了下来。“可怜的宝贝！你现在就得保证以后不再对他们粗暴，否则我是一步不会走的。”

“你对狗知道得太少，”她的弟弟抢白她道，“请别来干扰。他们就是偷懒，我告诉你。哪怕要他们干一点点活也得抽他们鞭子。他们就是这种脾气。你去问问别人，问问他们。”

梅西蒂斯乞求地望着人们，漂亮的脸上满是见到苦难的抵触情绪。

“他们是像水一样柔顺的，你要是想知道的话，”一个人回答，“问题在于他们是累坏了，他们需要休息。”

“休息个屁。”哈尔从那没毛的嘴里吐出一句话。

“啊！”梅西蒂斯一听见粗话就难受，痛苦地说。可她又很重视家庭关系，急忙保护她弟弟。“别听他的，”她尖刻地说，“你赶的是我们自己的狗，你认为该怎么赶最好就怎么赶。”

哈尔的鞭子第二次落到狗身上。狗群又狠命一拉，放矮了身子，腿脚踏进踩硬了的雪里，使出了浑身的力气。雪橇像是抛了锚似的不动。两次失败之后狗队停了下来，喘着气。鞭声刚呼啸起，梅西蒂斯又来干预了。她跪到巴克面前，眼里噙满了泪，双手抱住他的脖子。

“你可怜的可怜的宝贝，”她同情地说，“你干吗不使点劲呢——一使劲就不会挨鞭子了。”巴克不喜欢她，但他又感到难受，不愿反抗，只把这当做一天之中必须承受的一种痛苦。

一个旁观者一直捏紧拳头，忍住要出口的咒骂，现在说话了，“你们该怎么做，我不感兴趣，不过为了狗的缘故，我只想提醒你一句。你得让雪橇活动起来，那对狗是很大的帮助。橇板冻结了，抓住舵棍，使劲地左右摆，让雪橇活动起来。”

哈尔这回听从了劝告，第三次做了努力，使冻结在雪上的滑板活动了起来。负担过重行动不便的雪橇冲了出去，巴克和伙伴们在雨点般的鞭子下疯狂地拉着。那路在一百码地界拐了个弯顺着一个滑坡滑向了正街。要让那上重下轻的雪橇不倒得要个有经验的驭手，可哈尔并无经验。拐弯时雪橇翻了，没捆紧的行李一半落了出来。狗却没停，翻倒的减少了分量的雪橇在他们后面跳着蹦着。狗群因为受了虐待，也因为负担过重很生气。巴克大发雷霆，飞跑起来，狗队也跟着他飞跑。哈尔大叫：“哇！哇！”可狗群不听。他绊了一下，被拖倒了。翻倒的雪橇从他身上拖过，狗队向前冲，跑上了大街，橇上的行李沿着大街一路乱滚，斯卡格卫人看得好不开心。

好心人捉住狗拾回了行李，还给他们出了主意。真要想到达道森就得让行李减半狗数翻番。哈尔和他姐姐姐夫不情愿地听着。他们支起帐篷，检查了行李，把罐头食品扔掉了。这又叫人好笑，因为在漫长的雪路上罐头食品是梦寐以求的东西。“毛毯当旅馆，”一个人笑了，劝他们道，“就是一半也嫌太重，扔掉吧！把帐篷扔掉，还有那么多盘子——谁去洗盘子呢？老爷们，你们以为是在普尔曼卧铺车厢里旅游吗？”

于是照办了，无可奈何地扔掉了多余的东西。梅西蒂斯的衣物从口袋里倒了出来，一样一样扔掉了。她哭了，每扔一样东西她就哭一回，为扔掉她的东西哭，也为扔掉的那件东西哭。她两手搂住膝盖伤心地哭，哭得前仰后合。她断言她是一英寸也不会往前走了，就是为了十个查尔斯她也不会走了。她向每一个人哭诉，为每一件东西哭诉，最后又一面擦着眼泪，一面开始把必不可少的衣服都往外扔。她使起性子来，扔掉了自己的东西之后，又开始扔男人的东西，像一阵旋风似地扔着。

扔过之后，行李虽然去掉一半，却仍然是个庞然大物。查尔斯和哈尔黄昏出门又买回来四只外地狗。这四只狗和狗队原有的六只狗，再加上上次创记录的行程中在冰场瀑布买的两只雪橇狗提克和苦纳，使狗的总数达到了十四只。但是外地狗虽然来此之后受过些磨炼，能力毕竟有限。其中三只是短毛的追踪狗，一只是纽芬兰狗，另外两只是血统不明的杂种狗。这些陌生的狗似乎什么都不知道。巴克和伙伴们都讨厌他们，巴克迅速告诉他们知道自己的地位，教他们哪些事是不能做的，他们却老学不会。他们对皮带和雪路很反感。除了两条杂种狗，别的狗都为他们所进入的陌生的野蛮环境和受到的虐待弄得懵头转向，精神沮丧。两条杂种狗则蔫头搭脑，除了啃骨头，干别的什么都没有劲。

新手精神沮丧，无法调教，老手叫二千五百英里持续不断长途跋涉弄垮了，前景不可能不暗淡，可是两个男人倒很快活，而且得意。他们有十四条狗，事情办得很堂皇。通过关口去道森和从道森来的雪橇他们都见过，却从没见过赶十四只狗的。从北极旅行的性质来讲让十四只狗拉一只雪橇原本不当，因为一只雪橇带不了十四只狗的食物，可查尔斯和哈尔不懂得这个道理。他们是用铅笔计算这次旅行的：每只狗吃多少，有多少条狗，走多少日子，然后算出答案。梅西蒂斯从他们肩膀上望了望，理解地点了点头：再简单不过了。

第二天后半上午巴克带着长长的队伍经过了大街。他们走得没精打采，他跟伙伴们都不兴奋，还没出门已经累坏了。他曾在盐水和道森之间跑过四趟，可一想起累成这样还得走同样的长途，就一肚子怨气。他的心不在工作上，别的狗也一样。外地狗胆小怕事，懂行的狗对主人没有信心。

巴克朦胧感到那两男一女不可靠。他们什么都不会，时间长了还发现他们也不会学习。他们办什么事都马马虎虎，没有章法，没受过训练。搭一个蹩脚的帐篷要费半夜工夫，拆帐篷和上行李又得花半个上午，行李收拾得松松垮垮，一天所余的时光又老在停橇收拾行李。有几回他们一天还没走到十英里。有几天就索兴上不了路。有一个基本距离是用以计算狗食的，他们没有哪一天曾达到过这个距离的一半。

因此狗食不足是无可避免的，可是他们还给狗太多的食物，使粮食不足的时间提前到来，不得已又只好克扣定量。外来狗没有经过周期性挨饿的锻炼，不能少进食多消化。他们食量都非常大。一见他们能吃，又见疲倦不堪的雪橇狗没有力气，哈尔便认定是传统定量太少，让定量翻了一番。更糟糕的是梅西蒂斯美丽的眼里噙满了眼泪，颤着嗓门乞求再给他们增加定量，而在乞求失败后又从鱼袋里偷了鱼悄悄给他们吃，但是巴克和雪橇狗缺乏的并不是食物而是休息，因此尽管行程缓慢，他们所拉的沉重的行李却严重地消耗着他们的力气。

于是食物不足的时间到了。哈尔有一天忽然明白狗食已消耗了一半，而路程却只走了四分之一；而且无论是凭人情，还是花钱买，新狗食都弄不到手。于是他便让狗食低于正规定量，却又试图增加每日的里程。

他的姐姐和姐夫都支持他，可他们沉重的行李和自己的无能却挫折了他们。克扣狗食容易，要他们快跑却不行。他们自己早上迟迟无法上路，也使他们无法增加行动时间。他们不但不懂得使用狗，连使用自己也不会。

第一个离队的是达布。这个可怜的老犯错误的小偷虽总是被抓住，受到惩罚，干活却一向是忠心的。他扭伤的肩胛骨得不到治疗，也没有休息，情况越来越严重了。最后哈尔用那把大科尔特连发枪把他毙了。那地方有个说法，外地狗是吃雪橇狗的定量饿死的。巴克手下那六只外地狗只吃雪橇狗定量的一半哪能不死呢！纽芬兰狗第一个饿死，随后是三条短毛猎犬，两条杂种狗活得顽强些，可最终还是死去了。

到这时三个人身上那种南方式的优雅与温和已经荡然无存。北极之游失去了它的魅力与浪漫，对他们男性的潇洒和女性的温柔来说，它成了太难堪的现实。梅西蒂斯不再为狗哭了，她为自己哭得太多，跟丈夫和弟弟吵得太多。他们唯一不感到疲倦的只是吵架。痛苦使他们爱发脾气，痛苦越大脾气也越大，脾气成倍地增加，超过了痛苦。雪路上那种了不起的耐性使勤劳的受苦人轻言细语，温和亲切，可对这两男一女却不起作用。他们丝毫没有这种耐性。痛苦使他们生硬起来，他们肌肉酸痛，骨头酸痛，连心也酸痛了，因此说话尖刻，早上起身第一句话尖刻，晚上就寝最后一句话还是尖刻。

梅西蒂斯一给查尔斯和哈尔机会他俩就争吵，双方都深信自己做事太多，一有机会就忍不住要抱怨。梅西蒂斯有时站在丈夫一边，有时站在弟弟一边。结果是一场无休无止的美妙的家庭争吵。从谁该劈几根柴（那是查尔斯与哈尔之间的争执）起，能立即转到家族里别的人身上，闲话连篇，双方的爸爸、妈妈、叔叔、表兄弟、八竿子打不着的远亲，包括死人。哈尔对艺术的见解和他舅父写的社会剧能跟劈柴发生什么关系，叫人难以理解；可是争吵仍然往这类问题上扯，跟往查尔斯的政治偏见上扯一样。而查尔斯的姐姐那条造谣生事的舌头能跟在育空河边生火发生什么关系，也只有梅西蒂斯自己才明白。她却在这个问题上滔滔不绝，大泄私愤，又还附带提起某些对她夫家来说并不愉快的家族特征。与此同时火却没有生，帐篷只搭了一半，狗也没有喂。

梅西蒂斯还有一种特别的怨气——女人的怨气。她长得漂亮，性格又温柔，一辈子见到的都是殷勤体贴，骑士风度，可现在她丈夫和弟弟对她却是一点骑士风度也没有了。他们抱怨她无能成了习惯，可她却认为那是她女性最根本的特权，因为这番指责她闹了他们一个天翻地覆。她又疼痛又疲倦，也就顾不上狗了，总坚持要坐在雪橇上。她虽然漂亮温柔，可毕竟有一百二十磅——这对那些衰弱饥饿的牲畜简直是压断了骆驼脊梁的最后一根大稻草。她连续坐了许多天，直坐得狗群在雪路上倒了下来，雪橇站住不动。查尔斯和哈尔要她下来走路，跟她讲理，请求她，她却哭哭啼啼一再向上天缕述他俩的粗暴。

有一回他们总算用尽全力把她从雪橇上弄了下来，可以后再也没敢那么做。她像个娇惯的孩子一样走得懒洋洋的，后来竟在路上坐定不动了。他们径自走了，她仍然不动。他们走了三英里，又只好甩掉行李赶回来用强力把她弄上雪橇。

由于自己太痛苦，他们对狗的痛苦已经麻木不仁。哈尔有个理论，总在别人身上使用。那理论是：锻炼能使人坚强。他对姐姐和姐夫开始阐述这个道理。对方不听，他又靠大棒用到狗的身上。到了五指山狗食没有了，一个没牙老太婆想用几磅冰冻的马皮换他那支跟大猎刀挂在腰上的科尔特连发枪。这种马皮即使是六个月前刚从牲口贩子那饥饿的马身上扒下来时，也只能是很蹩脚的代食品。现在经过冰冻更像是电镀过的铁皮。狗费尽力气吞咽下去却溶化成了没有营养的细皮条和一大堆短毛，消化不了，还老让狗闹肚子疼。

在这整个过程中巴克都跌跌撞撞坚持在排头狗的位置上，仿佛做着噩梦。能拉他就拉；拉不动他就倒下，直到鞭子或大棒赶他起来。他那身美丽的毛茸茸的袍子失去了全部的韧性和光泽，那毛松垮垮地耷拉了下来，拖得又湿又脏。受到哈尔鞭子和大棒打击之处毛和血结成了毡块。肌肉耗尽了，只看到疙疙瘩瘩的筋络，肉垫没有了，身架上的每一根肋条和骨头都透过松垮的皮清楚地露了出来。那皮里面空了，皱成了褶子，看了直叫人泄气，可巴克却不会泄气。这一点穿红绒线衫的人已经证明。

巴克如此，他的伙伴们也如此。他们都是些游荡的骷髅。包括他在内一共是七条。由于巨大的痛苦他们对鞭子和大棒已失去了知觉。挨打的痛楚迟钝而遥远，跟他们眼中所见和耳中所闻的东西一样迟钝而遥远。他们只不过活着，或说只有四分之一条命还活着。他们不过是些撑着骨头架子的口袋，生命的火光只在其中微微颤动。一叫停，他们就挂着皮带倒下，像死掉了一样，那火光暗淡下去，朦胧下去，似乎就要熄灭。大棒或鞭子落到身上，火光又微弱地燃起，他们又颤颤巍巍地站了起来，歪歪倒倒地往前走。

有一天性格温驯的比利倒下了，再也爬不起来。哈尔已经换掉了手枪，便拿起斧头对准躺在皮带下的比利的脑袋一敲，然后割断皮带把尸体拖到了一边。巴克看见了，他的伙伴们也看见了，他们明白那一天已近在眼前。第二天苦纳也走了。只剩下了五条狗：乔太疲倦，玩不出花样了；派克残废了，跛着脚，只有一半知觉，不会装病了；独眼的索莱克斯仍然忠于皮带下雪路上的苦役，他因为他只有那么点力气干活而感到悲伤；那年冬天还没走多少路的提克现在挨的鞭子最多，因为他精神最好；还有巴克。他还做着排头狗，可再也不执行纪律或打算执行了，有一半的时间他衰弱得瞎了眼，只靠了模糊的影子和脚下依稀的感觉在雪路上挣扎着前进。

已到了春光明媚的季节，可狗和人还感觉不到。太阳一天比一天起得早，落得晚。早上三点天就亮了，晚上九点仍然半明不暗。悠长的白日阳光普照。冬季阴森森的寂静让位给了春天万物复苏的无边悄语。这种悄语遍及大地，充满了生命的欢乐。欢乐来自生命的复苏与萌动——来自多少个冰冻的月份中死寂不动的东西。松树的树液奔流，柳树和白杨绽出了嫩芽；灌木和藤蔓穿上了绿袍。夜里蟋蟀鸣叫，白天到处是爬行和蠕动。爬行的东西簌簌地溜进了阳光。林里有松鸡嘭嘭的啼叫和啄木鸟的叩啄。松鼠啾啾碎语，鸟儿婉转娇鸣。南方飞来的大雁摆成巧妙的人字形劈破长空在头顶伊伊唔唔唱过。

每一道土坡都有泉水滴答，那是隐秘处的泉水的音乐。一切都在解冻，在弯曲，在碎裂。育空河正努力摆脱捆缚它的坚冰。河水从下面消溶，太阳从上面融化。气孔出现了，裂缝崩开了，扩大了，薄冰大片大片落入河道。在苏醒的生命的崩裂、撕扯、搏动之际，在白亮的阳光之下，在低吟的微风之中，两男一女和几条雪橇狗却像走向死亡的旅人一样跌跌撞撞地走着。

狗一只只倒下，梅西蒂斯坐在雪橇上哭，哈尔无意义地咒骂着，查尔斯眼睛湿湿的，沉思着，可他们终于跌跌撞撞走进了白河口的索恩顿的营地。狗群刚一站住便倒下了，仿佛全给打死了。梅西蒂斯擦干了眼泪望着约翰·索恩顿。查尔斯坐在一块木头上休息。他全身都僵了，坐下时很慢很痛苦。交涉是由哈尔办的。约翰·索恩顿把桦木棍一小刀一小刀地削成斧柄。一面削着最后几刀，一面听，回答都用单音节词。对方要求出主意，他也出得简短。他知道这号人，他提出劝告，却也肯定对方是不会接受的。

哈尔听见索恩顿劝他别在已融化的冰上去冒险，他却回答说：“我们在上面就听人说雪路的底子已经脱掉，劝我们最好等待。说我们到不了白河，可我们这不是已经到了吗？”最后一句话还带着胜利的嘲笑的调子。

“人家告诉你的话没错，”约翰·索恩顿回答，“底子任何时候都有可能脱落，只有傻瓜，只有傻瓜靠瞎碰才能碰到这里。我跟你直说了吧，哪怕把全部阿拉斯加的黄金都给我，我也不愿拿我这把骨头去冒险呢！”

“那是因为你不是傻瓜，我估计，”哈尔说，“我们照样会到达道森的。”他抖开了鞭子。“起来，巴克！嗨！起来，走哇！”

索恩顿继续削斧柄。他知道要想挡住傻瓜干傻事是白费力气。多或者少两三个傻瓜也无关天下大局。

但是命令虽然下了，狗队却没站起来。他们早已过了能抽打得起来的阶段。鞭子一鞭一鞭地抽，执行着残酷的任务。约翰·索恩顿抿紧了嘴唇。索莱克斯第一个爬着站了起来。提克是第二个。乔也跟着站了起来，却痛得叫了。派克痛苦地挣扎着想起身，两次都只站起一半就倒下了，第三次总算站了起来。巴克没有努力，只躺在倒下的地方一声不响。鞭子一再抽到他身上，他却既不叫，也不挣扎。好几次索恩顿似乎要说话，却又忍住了，他两眼湿润了。鞭子继续抽，他站了起来踌躇不决地走来走去。

这是巴克第一次站不起来，因此正足以使哈尔大发雷霆。他把鞭子换成了常用的大棒。更沉重的打击雨点一般落到巴克身上，可他仍拒绝行动。他跟伙伴们一样勉强可以站起来，但他却决心不动。他模糊地意识到末日已来临。这种感觉在他拉着雪橇来到河岸时已很强烈，现在也没有离开。他成天在脚下感觉到的薄冰和糟烂的冰使他感到灾难已近在咫尺，就在眼前主人要赶他去的冰面上。他拒绝动弹。他受过太多的苦难，体会太深，挨了大棒也不觉得痛。大棒继续地打，生命之火跳了跳，却往下沉，快要熄灭了。他感到一种奇怪的麻木。他觉得那棒打得很辽远。最后的痛楚消失了，他什么疼痛也没有了，虽然还依稀感到大棒打在身上，可那已不是他的身子，他的身子似乎在远处。

于是，约翰·索恩顿突然发出了一声野兽一样的吼叫，便出其不意地扑到了挥动棒子的人身上。哈尔像被一棵落下的树击中一样飞了回来。梅西蒂斯发出尖叫，查尔斯若有所思地旁观着，擦着他潮润的眼睛，因为身子僵硬没有站起来。

约翰·索恩顿俯看着巴克，努力控制住自己。他气得直抽搐，说不出话来。

“你要再打这狗我就要你的命。”他终于气喘吁吁地说出了这句话。

“那是我的狗，”哈尔走回来，擦着嘴边的血说，“少管闲事，否则我就修理你。我要到道森去。”

索恩顿站在他和巴克之间，没有让开的意思。哈尔拔出了长猎刀。梅西蒂斯尖叫，呐喊，忽然哈哈大笑，表现出歇斯底里的放肆与混乱。索恩顿一斧柄打在哈尔的指关节上，把刀子打落在地。他伸手要捡，索恩顿又敲了他的指关节一下，然后自己弯腰拾起了刀，两刀就割断了巴克的皮带。哈尔再也没有了打架的勇气，而且他的两手或说两臂又在忙着扶他的姐姐；何况巴克离死亡又太近，要拉雪橇已不行了。几分钟之后他们离开了河岸，向河里跑去。巴克听见他们出发，抬起头来看，派克拉排头，索莱克斯做辕狗，乔和提克在他俩之间。几条狗都跛着脚歪歪倒倒地走着。梅西蒂斯坐在行李橇上。哈尔在舵杆边掌舵，查尔斯跌跌撞撞跟在后面。

巴克望着他们，索恩顿跪在他身边，用粗拙却温情的手寻找着骨折的地方。待到他发现巴克除了累累的伤痕和严重的饥饿再没有别的问题时，那雪橇已走出了四分之一英里。狗和人望着雪橇在冰上缓缓前进。突然，他们看见雪橇后部往下一坐，好像落进了冰辙，橇舵带着哈尔一起被弹到了空中。梅西蒂斯的尖叫传入他们耳里。他们看见查尔斯转过身往回跑了一步，一大段冰往下一沉，连人带狗便都不见了。他们眼前只留下了一个张大嘴的冰洞——雪橇的路早就脱了底了。

约翰·索恩顿和巴克彼此望了一望。

“你这个可怜的家伙。”约翰·索恩顿说，巴克舔了舔他的手。





第六章　为了对一个人的爱


头年十二月约翰·索恩顿冻伤了双脚。他的伙伴们给他安排得舒舒服服的，让他自己去养伤，便溯江而上走了，打算放一筏木料到道森去。他救巴克的时候还有些跛，但是随着温暖气候的持续那点跛也消失了。巴克在这儿，在这漫长的春天里躺在河边上望着流水，懒洋洋地听着鸟儿唱歌和大自然低吟，力气也逐渐恢复。

谁若是跋涉过三千英里是会感到休息之乐的。应该承认巴克在伤口愈合、肌肉渐渐丰满、肌腱重新在骨头上长出的过程中是越来越懒散了。从这个意义上讲他们全都在游手好闲——巴克、约翰·索恩顿、斯基特和尼格——他们都在等着筏子下来带他们到道森去。斯基特是一只爱尔兰小猎犬，她最早来跟巴克交朋友，巴克快要死了，无法对她最初的殷勤表示反感。她具有某些狗所具有的医护天性。她好像母猫舔干净小猫一样，把巴克的伤舔得干干净净。每天早上他一吃完早饭她便按时来完成自己找来的任务。后来他便像找索恩顿一样找她护理了。尼格也同样友好，虽然不那么外露。他是只大黑狗，是狼狗和猎鹿狗的混血种，有一双笑眯眯的眼睛，脾气非常好。

令巴克意外的是两条狗对他并无妒忌的表现。他们似乎也具有索恩顿的慈祥与宽厚。巴克身体略为恢复之后，他们就诱使他做许多好笑的游戏。就连索恩顿自己也忍不住来参加。巴克就像这样在顽皮嬉闹之中度过了他的养病时期，进入了新的生活。爱，真正的充满激情的爱，第一次出现在他心里。在阳光普照的圣克拉拉峡谷米勒法官家里他并不曾体会过这种感情。跟法官的儿子们打猎漫游，他是他们的猎伴；跟法官的孙子们在一起，他是个神气十足的保镖；跟法官自己相处，则是一种庄严崇高的友谊关系。可是炽烈燃烧的爱，那是崇拜，那是狂热，是只有约翰·索恩顿才能燃起的。

这个人救了他的命，这是一；他是个理想的主人，这是二。别人是因为责任和工作方便才照料狗的，而他照料狗是情不自禁，有如照料自己的孩子。而他的感情更深。他是连一声友好的招呼或是一句鼓励的话都是永志不忘的。至于跟狗坐在一起长谈（索恩顿叫做“唠嗑儿”）不但狗感到快活，他也觉得快活。索恩顿有个动作，会粗暴地搂着巴克的脑袋，把自己的脑袋放在上面使劲地晃，同时用许多难听的名字骂他——在巴克听来那都是深情的称呼。巴克觉得那粗暴的拥抱和低声的咒骂是最叫他快活的东西。每一次摇晃他都有一种沦肌浃髓的极乐之感，心都要从腔子里跳出来了。索恩顿一松手他便站起来望着他，一动不动，嘴角含着笑意，眼里露出激情，没有发出的声音在喉咙里颤动。这时约翰·索恩顿便很尊重地感叹道：“天哪！你就只差会说话了！”

巴克有一种表示爱的方式，差不多是一种伤害，他常用口衔着索恩顿的手猛然一咬，事后很久都留下牙印。那人却明白这种假咬其实是亲热的表示，正如巴克明白那些咒骂是爱的称呼一样。

不过，巴克的大部分的爱却表现为崇拜。只要索恩顿抚摸他，跟他说话，他都会欢喜得发狂。可他并不要求这类爱抚。他跟斯基特不同，斯基特总要把鼻子伸到索恩顿的手下拱个不停，要求对方爱抚。他也跟尼格不同，尼格总喜欢走上前来把大脑袋放到索恩顿的膝盖上。可巴克却满足于远远的崇拜。他总躺在索恩顿的脚边，急切而敏锐地望着他的脸，研究它，以最大的兴趣跟随着他变化的表情、动作或是形体的改变。偶然，他也躺在他旁边或身后更远的地方，望着那人的轮廓和偶然的身体动作。巴克注视的力量常常会使约翰·索恩顿转过头来——他们之间常常有这样的默契，索恩顿也会报之以无言的注视，巴克的心在眼里闪光时索恩顿的心也在眼里闪光。

巴克在被救之后许久都不愿让索恩顿从他眼里消失。从他离开帐篷到他回到帐篷他都紧跟着他。自从来到北国之后他的几个主人都是不久便消失了的。这形成了他的一种畏惧。他觉得主人总是不会长久的。他怕索恩顿也会像佩罗特、法朗索瓦和苏格兰混血儿一样从他的生活中消失。即使在夜里做梦，这种恐惧也常侵扰他。这时他便抖掉睡意穿过寒冷的夜空来到帐篷门帘边，站在那儿谛听他主人的呼吸。

但尽管他对约翰·索恩顿有着巨大的爱，这爱似乎说明文明使他产生了温情，但北方的土地在他心中所唤起的原始气质仍然存在而且活跃。他具有产生于火与房屋的忠实献身的特质，却仍然保留着野性和狡猾。他是蛮荒的动物，更像是从蛮荒来到约翰·索恩顿的篝火边的，而不像是温和的南方狗，身上有许多代文明的烙印。因为他巨大的爱，他不能偷这人的东西。可是偷别的人或别的营地的东西他却毫不犹豫。他偷得很狡猾，能使自己不被发现。

他的脸上和身上留下了许多狗咬的伤疤。打架却照样凶猛，而且更加巧妙。斯基特和尼格脾气很好，不会吵架——而且他们是约翰·索恩顿的狗。但是陌生的狗，不管是什么品种，有多么英勇，都很快就承认了巴克的最高地位，或是发现自己在一个可怕的对手面前为生命而挣扎。巴克是残忍的。他很懂得大棒和獠牙的法律；他从不轻易放弃优势。一投入生死斗争他就决不退让。他从斯匹茨那里学了一课，从警署和邮路的狗那里还学了许多课。他明白中间道路是没有的。他必须做主人，否则就得做奴隶，而表现仁慈是一种软弱。在原始生活中不存在仁慈。仁慈会被误解为畏葸，而这种误解能导致死亡。杀，或是被杀；吃，或是被吃，这就是法律。他服从的是产生于时光深处的这种命令。

他比他所度过的时光和呼吸过的空气都要古老。他连接了古代和此刻，他身后的永恒以强有力的节奏在他体内搏动，他也随着潮流和季节的律动而律动。他是一只胸脯宽阔的狗，坐在约翰·索恩顿的篝火边，长着白色的獠牙，长长的毛，可他身后却有各种各样的狗的影子。半狼，野狼，迫切，敏锐，他吃肉，他们嘴里有味；他喝水，他们感到口渴；他嗅出风向，他们也感觉分明。野生动物在森林里发出的声音是他们告诉他的。他们决定他的情绪，指导他的行动。他睡下，他们跟他睡在一起，一起做梦，梦得超出了自己。他们也成了他梦中的形象。

这些形象专横地召唤他，使得人类和人类的要求离他越来越远。从密林深处传来了一种呼喊，他常常听见这带着神秘的刺激和引诱的呼喊，他常常感到不能不离开篝火和它周围人迹众多的土地进入森林，在那里前进，前进，向他不知道的地方前进，也不知道为什么要前进。他也不思考要到哪儿去，为什么去，那呼喊专横霸道，来自密林的深处，可是他每一次进入那松软的人迹未到的地方和绿色的暗影时，他对约翰·索恩顿的爱又吸引他回到了火边。

只有索恩顿吸引着他，此外，整个人类都似乎并不存在。偶然的旅客可能称赞他，爱抚他，可他的心是冷的，遇到表情太强烈的，他还会站起身走掉。索恩顿的伙伴汉斯和彼得驾着盼望已久的木筏到达时，巴克不愿理睬他们，后来知道他们是索恩顿的密友才改变了态度，但也只是消极地忍受。他们给他的，他都接受，可接受得倒像是一种恩赐。他们也都跟索恩顿一样是宽厚的人，紧贴着土地生活，思想单纯，看问题清楚。还没等他们把木筏撑到道森的锯木厂边的大回水沱他们已经懂得了巴克和他的习惯，也不要求跟他能像跟斯基特和尼格那么亲密。

他对索恩顿的感情不断增长。夏天旅行时只有索恩顿才能往他背上搁包裹。只要是索恩顿的命令，什么艰巨的活儿他都能干。他们用木筏的收益跟人订了矿藏发现利润共同分配的合同，离开了道森向塔纳那河的源头进发。有一天三个人和几条狗坐在一道壁陡的悬崖顶上，那崖直落三百英尺，下面是赤裸裸的岩床。约翰·索恩顿坐在悬崖顶上，巴克站在他的肩膀旁边。索恩顿忽然产生了一个没经思考的奇想，他让汉斯和彼得注意他打算做的实验。“跳，巴克！”他一只手臂对着峡谷一挥，发出命令。紧接着巴克便往下跳，他赶快一把拽住他。于是，狗和人在悬崖边挣扎起来，汉斯和彼得忙拽住他俩往安全处拉。

“想入非非！”事后他们回过神来，彼得说。

索恩顿摇摇头。“不，太精彩了，可是，也太可怕了。你知道不，这有时也叫我担心。”

“我可不愿在你身边有他跟你作对。”彼得得出了结论，对巴克点着头。

“说个正着！”汉斯表示支持，“我也这么想。”

彼得担心的事那年还不到年底就在圆形城出现了。“黑人”伯敦，一个脾气古怪心肠狠毒的人在酒吧找一个新手寻衅闹事，索恩顿心平气和地去劝解。巴克按习惯躺在一个角落里，脑袋放在爪子上望着主人的一举一动。伯敦二话不说顺手一拳就打了过来。索恩顿被打得旋了两圈，幸亏一把抓住了酒吧栏杆才没有摔倒在地。

旁边的人听见一种既非吠叫，也非号叫，最好叫做“咆哮”的声音传来，随即看到巴克的身子升到了空中——他已离开了地板向伯敦的喉头扑去。那人出于本能伸手一挥，算是救了自己一条命，却被扑倒在地，巴克落到了他身上。巴克放松了刚咬住的手臂，又去咬喉头。这一回那人只部分地挡住了他，喉头被撕破了。人们扑向巴克，把他赶走了；可是在外科医生检查流血情况时巴克还在那儿转来转去愤怒地咆哮着，想冲进去，只是叫许多气势汹汹的棍子赶走了。在现场召开了一个“淘金人会”，决议是：那狗的行动是对方招惹的，不予追究。但是巴克却一举成了名，从那天起，他的名字便在阿拉斯加的每一个营地里流传。

那年秋天，他又以很不相同的形式救了约翰·索恩顿一条命。三个伙伴要把一只长而窄的船放下四十英里河的一处险滩。汉斯和彼得走在岸上，用一根吕宋细麻绳往一棵一棵树上吊住船，索恩顿在船上用篙撑着，帮助往下放，并向岸上大喊，发出指示。巴克在岸上，跟着船跑，他又痛苦又着急，两眼从不离开主人。

在一个特别凶险的地点，有一片差不多全淹没的礁石嵖嵖岈岈露出在水上。汉斯松了绳，等索恩顿撑船进入急流后又抓住绳头，跑向岸边，打算等船穿过了礁群再吊住。船过了礁群却被一道快速如磨坊水槽的急流冲走了。这时汉斯却用绳吊住了船，只是吊得太猛，那船弹了起来，往河岸方向一跳，翻了。索恩顿甩了出来，被冲向险滩最凶恶的地带，那是一道最疯狂的急流，在那里游泳的人是没有一个能生还的。

巴克立即跳进水里，游了三百码，在一个疯狂的漩涡里追上了索恩顿。在他感到索恩顿抓住了自己的尾巴之后，便凭着自己那一身过人的力气往岸边游去。但是向岸边游的速度小，向下游冲的速度却大得惊人。下面传来了死亡的咆哮，那里疯狂的急流更加疯狂了，伸在水面的岩石群像一只硕大无比的梳子把急流撕成小股，激起无数水花。最后的陡泻所产生的吸力十分可怕，索恩顿明白已经无法到达河岸。他已被一块礁石狠狠地刮了一下，又在另一块礁上碰了一下，又猛然撞到第三块岩石上。他用双手抱住那礁石滑溜溜的顶部，放掉了巴克，在漩卷的流水的呼啸中高叫道：“走开，巴克！走开！”

巴克稳不住，被冲向了下游。他死命挣扎，却游不回来了。他听见索恩顿第二次下命令，便从水里竖了起来，高高地扬起头，似乎想看他最后一眼，然后便服从命令往岸边游去。他游得矫健有力，在毁灭即将出现前被彼得和汉斯拽到了岸边。

他们明白，一个人能抓住滑溜溜的岩石忍受急流冲刷的时间只能以分钟计算，急忙上岸来到索恩顿正上方一个地点，把拉船用的绳子小心翼翼地挎在巴克的脖子和肩膀上，不让绳勒住脖子，也不让它妨碍他游泳，然后把他放下了河。巴克勇敢地游了出来，却未能笔直地游进急流。等到他发现这个错误时已经太晚。

索恩顿已在只需划十来把水的地方跟他平齐，他却无可奈何地被冲走了。

汉斯把巴克当做船，急忙吊住绳子。绳子受急流一冲，抽紧了，把他扯到水下，他在撞到岸边被拉出水面之前一直浸在水里，早已淹了个半死。汉斯和彼得扑上去，捶打他，让他呼吸，挤出肚里的水。他摇摇晃晃地站起来，又倒下了。索恩顿的声音隐约传来，他们虽然听不出语句，却明白他处境危急。主人的声音像电击一样震动了巴克，他翻身跳起，抢到两人前面来到刚才出发的地点。

第二次拴好绳，他又被放了出去。他奋勇前进着。这一次他可是直奔急流了——他已经算错了一次，绝不能再算错了。汉斯放绳，不让绳松弛；彼得理绳，不让绳纠缠；巴克坚持游去，直游到索恩顿正上方，然后转过身以特快列车的速度向他漂去。索恩顿望着他受到整个急流冲击像撞城槌一样劈面打来，急忙伸出双手抱紧他毛茸茸的脖子。这时汉斯已把绳缠在树上，巴克跟索恩顿被弹进水里。人和狗挣扎着，呛着水，你上我下，我上你下地翻滚着从乱石嶙峋的河底拖过，在岩石和暗礁上撞过，冲到岸边。

索恩顿被肚子向下搁在了一块木头上，汉斯和彼得使劲反复推按着他，他醒了过来。他第一眼找的就是巴克。尼克正扑在巴克那仿佛没了生命的软沓沓的身子上嚎叫。斯基特在舔着他湿漉漉的脸和闭着的眼睛。索恩顿自己遍体鳞伤，却仔细检查了巴克的身体，把他劝开时他终于发现巴克断了三根肋骨。

“这就行了，”他宣布，“我们就在这儿宿营。”

他们就在那儿宿营，直住到巴克的肋骨愈合能够旅行。

那年冬天巴克在道森做了另一件事，也许不那么英雄，却让他的名字比阿拉斯加荣名的图腾柱还高了几格。这事叫他们特别满意。因为他们正需要它创造的条件到向往已久的东部处女地去旅行——那是淘金人未曾到达的地方。事情是因在埃尔多拉多沙龙的一次谈话引起的。大伙儿在那儿吹嘘自己心爱的狗。巴克因为他的事迹变成了谈话的靶子，索恩顿被迫奋起保卫。半小时之后有个人说，他的狗可以拉动一辆载重五百磅的雪橇，把它拖走。第二个人吹嘘他的狗可以拉走六百磅；第三个人提出的是七百磅。

“呸！呸！”约翰·索恩顿说，“巴克能拉动一千磅。”

“拉动一千磅走一百码？”淘金人中的幸运之王马修森说，刚才吹嘘七百磅的就是他。

“拉动一千磅走一百码。”约翰·索恩顿冷冷地说。

“好呀，”马修森故意说得很慢，好让大家听清楚，“我赌一千块钱，我说他办不到。钱就在这儿。”说时他把一口袋金沙扔在柜台上，那口袋有博洛尼亚[1]香肠那么粗。

没人说话。这是指明要索恩顿证实他的大话——若是他说了大话的话。索恩顿能感到热血涌上面颊。他的舌头给他惹祸了。他并不知道巴克是否能拉动一千磅。那可是半吨[2]呢！那巨大的重量把他吓坏了。他对巴克的力气很有信心，常常觉得他可以拉动一千磅，可从来没有像现在这样面对过这个问题。这时十多双眼睛盯住他，一言不发地等着。而且，他还拿不出一千块钱，汉斯和彼得也拿不出。

“我现在就有一个雪橇在外面，上面有二十袋面粉，每袋五十磅，”马修森硬邦邦毫不客气地说下去，“因此，别担心没有东西可拉。”

索恩顿没有回答。他不知道说什么好。他茫然地瞥过一张张面孔，像个失去思维能力的人在寻找着什么，想恢复思维。老朋友拳王吉姆·奥布瑞恩的脸落入他的眼睛。那张脸提醒了他，好像在鼓励他去做他做梦也不敢想的大事。

“你能借给我一千块吗？”他问，几乎是耳语。

“可以，”奥布瑞恩在马修森的钱袋边砰的一声扔下一个圆鼓鼓的袋子，“尽管我不大相信那畜牲有这个本领，约翰。”

埃尔多拉多的人全拥向街头来看这场考验。桌子全空了。做生意的和猎物看守人也来看打赌，也参加打赌。几百人穿着毛衣戴着手套各捡方便的地方靠雪橇围成了一圈。马修森的雪橇上堆了一千磅面粉，在酷寒之中（零下六十度）放了两个小时，橇底滑板已经跟凝固的雪冻在一起。人们以二对一打赌，认为巴克无力拉动雪橇。对“拉动”一词有人提出了异议。奥布瑞恩认为索恩顿有权敲松滑板，再让巴克从静止状态把它“拉动”，但马修森却坚持说赌注包含了把滑板从凝固的雪上“拉动”。眼见这场赌局形成过程的人大都支持这一说法，这一来认为巴克办不到的赌注升到了三对一。没有人肯为巴克赌，谁也不相信巴克能拉动。索恩顿是被逼下注的，他也忧心忡忡。现在看到了具体的事实，雪橇前面蜷缩着的是一个正规狗队：十只。这事便显得更不可能了。马修森兴高采烈。

“三对一，”他宣布，“我三对一再陪你赌一局，索恩顿。你怎么说？”

索恩顿脸上表现出强烈的怀疑。但他的战斗精神却被激发了——一种翱翔于胜败机会之上的战斗精神，它不承认不可能，它除了战斗的呼喊什么都听不见。他叫来了汉斯和彼得。他俩的金袋装得不多，再加上他自己的，三个伙伴也只能凑成二百元。他们不走运，这个数目已是他们的全部资本。可他们毫不犹豫地把它放到了马修森的六百元旁边。

狗队的十只狗被解了下来。巴克带着他自己的辔头被套上了雪橇。他已受到那激动的情绪感染，觉得必须以某种方式为约翰·索恩顿干一件大事。他那出色的外表引起了众人的啧啧称赞。他全身上下无懈可击，没有丝毫多余的肉，他那一百五十磅全是坚毅阳刚之气。他那毛茸茸的皮毛闪着丝绸的光，沿着脖子横过双肩生长的鬣毛尽管平静却已半竖，似乎凡有行动便会耸立。他仿佛有过剩的精力让每一根毛都显得生气勃勃。他那巨大的胸脯和粗壮的前腿跟全身恰成比例，肌肉形成结实的腱子，透过皮肤暴突而出。人们摸着他的肌肉，宣布说硬得像铁。赌注降到了二比一。

“乖乖，先生！乖乖，先生！”最新的狗界巨头，一位评狗权威结结巴巴地说，“我不看胜败就先给你出八百元，先生，我见他在那儿一站就给你出八百元。”

索恩顿摇摇头走到巴克身边。

“你可得离他远点，”马修森提出抗议，“自由比赛，给他天地。”

人群肃静下来，只听得见有人提出二对一的赌注，却没有人肯赌。每个人都承认巴克是一条了不起的牲口，可在他们眼里五十磅一袋共二十袋面粉的分量太重，不肯为此解开钱袋绳索。

索恩顿在巴克身边跪下，双手抱住他的脑袋，脸颊靠在他的脸颊上，他没有像平时那样摇晃他，或是悄悄发出亲热的咒骂，只对他的耳朵说悄悄话。“因为你爱我，巴克。因为你爱我。”他低声说。巴克压抑着兴奋，呜呜地叫。

人群好奇地看着。情况逐渐神秘起来，近似玩魔法了。索恩顿站起身，巴克用嘴衔住他戴了手套的手，咬了咬，然后依依不舍地放松了。这就是他的回答，不是用语言，而是用爱。索恩顿后退了几步。

“好了，巴克。”他说。

巴克拉紧了皮带，然后放松了几英寸。这是他学会的技巧。

“唧！”索恩顿响亮地叫道，叫声在紧张的肃静中显得尖锐。

巴克往右边拽了拽，拉直了皮带，然后用那一百五十磅的身子猛然扑出去。重载的雪橇颤抖了，滑板底下发出清脆的嚓嚓声。

“嗬！”索恩顿发出命令。

巴克重复刚才的动作。这回是往左拽，嚓嚓声变成断裂声，雪橇转动了，滑板滑动了，咔咔响着往旁边动了几英寸。雪橇拔出来了。人们屏住了气，集中注意力，却没意识到自己在集中注意力。

“现在，起！”

索恩顿的命令像枪声一样响亮。巴克猛然向前奋进，皮带拉紧了，又是猛然一震。他集中全身的力量做了巨大的努力，丝绸般的毛皮下肌肉抽搐，鼓成疙瘩，像一个个小活物，宽阔的胸脯贴近地面，头向前下方伸出，四只脚发疯一样拨拉，脚爪把板结的雪划出无数道平行的槽。雪橇摇晃了，颤抖了，开始前进了半步。他一只脚打了滑，有个人大声呻吟出来，然后雪橇便吃力地前进了，仿佛是一串疾速的跳动，却再也不停……半英寸……一英寸……两英寸。跳动明显减少，雪橇开始滑动，巴克立即加以利用，雪橇稳定地前进了。

人们倒抽了一口气，又开始呼吸，没有意识到他们曾暂时停止过呼吸。索恩顿跟在后面跑，用简短的话给巴克鼓劲。距离是早量好的。巴克来到那堆标志着一百码的柴堆前时，加油加油的声音越来越大。等到他越过柴堆按照命令停下时，加油声转化成了一片欢呼。每个人都发了狂，连马修森也一样。帽子和手套在空中乱飞。人们互相握手而不管对方是谁。大家唧唧喳喳七嘴八舌议论成一片。

索恩顿在巴克身边跪下了，脑袋贴着脑袋，他又在抱着他摇晃了。赶上前来的人听见他在咒骂巴克，骂个不停，骂得厉害，骂得又温柔又深情。

“天哪，先生！天哪，先生！”评狗之王唾沫飞溅地说，“我给你一千块钱买他，先生，一千块，先生——一千二百块，先生。”

索恩顿站了起来。他的眼睛湿润了，眼泪坦然地流过面颊。“先生，”他对评狗之王说，“不，先生，下地狱去吧，先生，这是我能给你办的最好的事。”

巴克用牙咬住了索恩顿的手。索恩顿抱着他前前后后地摇，双方都好像为一种共同的冲动所驱使。看热闹的退开了，以示尊重，再也没有不知趣的人来打扰他们。

第七章　呼唤声声


巴克在五分钟之内为约翰·索恩顿赚了一千六百元，使他的主人有了可能还清某些债务，然后跟伙伴一起到东部去寻找一个传说中的失踪的金矿。那传说古老得跟这个国家一样。许多人追寻过它，很少人找到过它，而更多的人则是一去不回。那失踪的金矿浸泡在悲剧里，也被神秘的尸衣所包裹。没人知道头一个发现那矿的人是谁。最古老的传说还没有回答那人便断了线。从一开始就有一个古老的快要坍塌的小木屋，临死的人赌咒发誓说那小屋是有的，它标志着的金矿也是有的，并拿出金块来斩钉截铁地作证。那金块跟北方土地上任何级别的黄金都不相同。

可是没有一个活着的人曾从这个宝窟夺宝归来，而死去的人又都已死去。因此约翰·索恩顿和彼得与汉斯便带着巴克和十来条别的狗沿着一条无人知晓的路向东方走去，要想去做跟他们一样能干的人和狗所没有做到的事。他们坐着雪橇溯育空河而上，走了七十英里，然后左弯进入史都华河，经过迈约和麦克奎斯顿，再继续前进，直到史都华河变成了涓涓细流在耸立的群峰之间蜿蜒流过。那里便是北美大陆的脊梁。

约翰·索恩顿对人和对大自然的要求都不多。他不怕旷野，只须带一包盐和一支枪，他就可以进入蛮荒野地，在他喜欢的地方过下去，想过多久就过多久。他从从容容，只按印第安人的方式一路走一路猎取食物；没猎取到，他也按印第安人的方式走下去。他有把握，他知道早晚会猎到的。因此，在这次伟大的东方之行中他的菜单上只有肉食。雪橇上的行李主要是弹药和工具，日程上写的是无限的未来。

对于巴克来说，这种打猎、捕鱼和在陌生地方的漫游简直是无穷无尽的欢乐。他们有时会一天接一天连续走上几个礼拜；有时又在这儿那儿连续宿营几个礼拜。把狗放出去闲逛，人们却用火烤冻结的腐植土和沙砾层，烤出洞来，再靠火的热力淘洗泥沙，淘上不知多少盘。他们有时挨饿，有时大喊大叫地猛吃，一切决定于猎物的多少和狩猎的运气。夏天到了，狗和人都背上行李，乘了木筏渡过了山间的湖泊，驾了树木锯成的细长的船在不知名的河流上顺流而下或溯水而上。

时间一个月一个月来来去去，他们在地图上没有记载的广阔的土地上来回地兜圈子。那地方渺无人烟，可若是那迷失的小木屋的故事不假，则又曾有人到过。他们在夏季的暴风雪里越过分水岭；他们在半夜的阳光里，在光秃秃的高山顶上冻得发抖——那是在森林带与永不消融的积雪之间。他们穿过成群结队的苍蝇蚊子下到夏季的山谷里；他们在冰河的阴影里采摘草莓和花朵，其成熟和美丽不亚于南国的同类。那年秋天他们进入了一片凄凉寂静的奇异的湖区，那儿曾经有过野禽，可这时已全没了生命的痕迹——只有透骨的寒风、在背阴处凝结的冰凌和在寂寥的沙岸边荡漾的凄凉的水波。

他们在往日的人迹已经湮没的地方又游荡了整整一个秋季。有一回他们遇到了在林中标出的一条小径。那是一条古老的路，“湮没的小木屋”似乎就在附近，但是这小径的来踪去迹却渺茫难寻，终究还是个谜，因为开路的人是个谜，开路的原因也是个谜。另有一回他们遇到了一间古老的狩猎屋的废墟。在腐败的毛毯破片中约翰·索恩顿发现了一支长管燧石猎枪——他认得那是西北开发早期哈德逊湾公司的出品，那时这样一支枪能值跟枪一般高的一摞貂皮，可此外便一无所有——关于那早期在这里搭造了小屋把枪留在了毛毯里的人的情况一点迹象也没找到。

春天又来了，经过了这样的漫游之后他们终于在一道宽阔的峡谷里找到了一道狭窄的沙金矿脉——不是在那“湮没的小木屋”。在那儿黄金在淘金盘底像黄色的奶油一样呈现。他们不再寻找了。他们每工作一天都能得到价值数千元的纯金沙和金块。他们每天干活。黄金用麋鹿皮口袋盛好，每袋五十磅，像大量的劈柴一样堆在云杉枝搭建的木屋门外。他们像巨人一样劳动，一天跟着一天像梦一样飞逝，他们的宝藏越堆越高。

现在除了偶然把索恩顿猎得的肉食捡回来，狗群已无事可做。巴克便一连许多个小时坐在篝火旁做梦。现在他闲了，那短腿毛人的幻觉便更常在他心中出现了。而且巴克在火堆边迷糊时还常在他所记得的另一个世界里跟那人漫游。

那另一个世界里最突出的东西似乎是害怕。巴克看见那毛人两手抱住脑袋埋在膝盖之间睡在篝火旁时总是睡不安稳，总要多少次地惊悸，醒来。这时那人总要恐惧地望进黑暗，并把更多的柴火扔到篝火上。即使那毛人在海滩上走，一面拾着海星，一面吃着，他的眼睛也总是四处察看，害怕有隐藏的危险，而且打算危险一出现就像风一样跑掉。毛人在森林里悄悄地出没，巴克跟在他的身后；双方都很警惕很紧张，耳朵抖动着转动着，鼻翼颤抖着，因为毛人的听觉和嗅觉都像巴克一样灵敏。毛人可以跳上树去前进，跟在地面上一样快。他用手在树枝之间荡来荡去，有时离地面十来英尺高，这边松手，那边抓住，从不失手，从不落地，实际上他在树上跟在地面上同样习惯。巴克记得许多警惕的夜晚，那时毛人是蹲在树叶里过夜的，睡着时也把树枝抓得很紧。

而跟那毛人的幻觉密切有关的则是仍然从密林深处发出的呼唤。那呼唤用一种巨大的不安和奇怪的欲望充满了他的心，让他感到一种模糊而甜蜜的欢乐，使他意识到了种种狂野的渴望和激动，追求着某种他所不知道的东西。有时他跟随着那呼唤来到树林里寻找它，仿佛它是某种有形的事物，寻找时他随自己的心情有时温和地叫着，有时挑战似的叫着。他把鼻子伸进树林里凉悠悠的苔藓中，或是伸进茂草生长的黑土中，因为嗅到土壤那肥沃的气味便欢喜地喷着响鼻。有时他又一连几个小时坐在长满菌类的倒下的树干背后，仿佛在隐蔽，对他身边活动着或发出声响的东西睁大眼睛看着，竖起了耳朵听着。他这样埋伏着可能是在希望对他还不了解的呼唤进行突然袭击。他不了解何以要这样做，但他不得不做，也并不思考。

他为种种无法拒绝的冲动所左右。有时他在炎热的白昼躺在营地上懒洋洋地打盹儿，却突然抬起头竖起耳朵专心地听，然后翻身爬起疾跑。跑呀跑呀，一跑几个小时，跑过林中走廊，跑过树胶成串的开阔地。他喜欢跑过干涸的河床，爬去偷看鸟儿们的林居生活。有时他一整天躺在林中的灌木丛里偷看松鸡走来走去嘭嘭地叫。他特别喜欢在夏日午夜半明不暗的清光中跑动，静听森林压抑的梦中细语，像人类读书一样读着各种迹象和声音，寻找着对他发出的神秘的呼唤——无论他醒着，还是睡着，那声音都一直在呼唤他去。

有一天晚上他忽然一惊，跳了起来，目光急切颤动，鼻翼嗅着，竖起的鬣毛闪动着。从树林里传来了呼唤（或许是一种呼唤，因为呼唤的调子很多），比以前任何时候都清楚、明确——一种悠长的嚎叫，有点像雪橇狗的声音，又不大像。那声音很熟悉，他知道是从前听见过的。他跳过沉睡的营地，迅疾无声地穿过了树林。靠近叫声时他放慢了脚步，小心每个动作，来到林中一片开阔地边，往外一看，见到一头瘦长的大灰狼蹲得直直的，鼻子向着天空。

他一点声音也没出，可那狼已停止了嚎叫，似乎要觉察出他。巴克走进空地，半蹲了下去，身子收得紧紧的，尾巴又直又硬，以不常见的细心迈着步。他的每一个动作都表现出威胁与友好的混合含意，标志着猛兽见面时那种带威胁性的休战，但是那狼一见他却逃跑了，他猛跳猛追，急着要赶上他，把他赶进了一道河床中的死胡同。那儿一大堆倒下的树堵死了出路。那狼像乔和所有被追得无路可走的雪橇狗一样，以后腿为支点猛然一旋，转过身来，竖起鬣毛咆哮着，急速不断地咬着，牙齿嗒嗒地响。

巴克没有进攻，而是围着他转，以友好的表示把他围住。那狼心怀疑惧，而且害怕，因为巴克的个子有他的三倍大，他的头只能达到巴克的肩。那狼觑了一个空儿逃了。追逐继续，那狼又多次被逼得无路可走，却都觑个空儿逃掉，他身体显然有病，否则巴克是不会轻易追上他的。往往是巴克的头已追赶到他的腰际，他才转过身来跟他对峙，然后再找机会逃掉。

但是巴克的毅力终于得到了报偿，因为那狼终于意识到他并无恶意，于是跟他鼻子对鼻子彼此嗅了一会儿，然后半是紧张，半是不好意思地跟他玩到了一起——猛兽为了掩饰自己的凶猛往往如此。玩了一会儿那狼又大步慢跑着离开了。他的态度清楚表示他要到别处去，并向巴克明确表示要他跟着去！他俩在阴沉沉的朦胧微光中并肩跑着，溯河床而上，越过了小河源头所在的荒凉的分水岭。

下了分水岭那一面的山坡，他们进入了一片平坦的荒原，那儿有大片大片的树林和不计其数的溪流。他俩穿过了树林，一小时一小时坚持不懈地跑下去。太阳升了起来，空气暖和了。巴克高兴极了。他知道他终于响应了呼唤，跟他在森林里的弟兄一起跑着，在走向发出呼唤的地方。古老的回忆在他心底匆匆唤起。他感到激动，正如过去因某些现实而激动一样，而回忆则不过是那些现实的影子。现在他又在做着他在另一个只隐约记得的世界的某处曾做过的事。他在旷野之中自由自在地奔跑，脚下是冰雪消融的土地，头上是广阔无垠的天空。

他们来到流水边停下来喝水，可巴克刚一停步却想起了约翰·索恩顿，不禁坐了下来。狼开始继续跑，肯定是要到发出呼唤的地方，但见他没动，又跑了回来，嗅他的鼻子，做出动作，似乎是在鼓励他，但是巴克却转过身来开始沿原路慢慢往回跑。他的野物朋友轻轻地呜呜着跟他一起跑了大半个钟头，然后坐了下来，鼻子向天发出呜咽，那是伤心的呜咽。巴克坚持往回跑。他听见那呜咽微弱下来，最后终于在远处消失。

巴克冲进营地扑向约翰·索恩顿时他正在吃午饭。巴克感情冲动，把他扑倒在地，在他身上乱蹦，舔他的脸，咬他的手——“胡闹一气”，正如约翰·索恩顿所说。同时他也抱住巴克晃来晃去，深情地咒骂着。

连续两天两夜巴克没有离开过营地，没有让索恩顿离开过他的眼睛。他工作，他跟着；他吃饭，他望着。他晚上看着他钻进毛毯；早上望着他钻了出来。可是两天之后森林的呼唤比任何时候都迫切了，巴克又开始坐立不安。他的野生弟兄开始在他心底不断出现：他想起分水岭外那微笑的土地，广阔的林带里那肩并肩的奔跑。他又开始在森林里漫游，可那野生的弟兄并没有再来；他尽管彻夜不眠久久地听着，那凄凉的嚎叫却再也不曾响起。

他开始夜间在野地睡觉，连续多少日子不回营地。有一次他越过了河源的分水岭，下到了森林和溪流的土地，在那儿漫游了一个礼拜，想找到野生的弟兄的新迹象。他一面漫游，一面猎取自己的食物，用的是似乎永远不会疲倦的轻松的大步慢跑。他在一道宽阔的溪流上捕鳜鱼，那溪流在某个地方注入海里。在这条溪流边他杀死了一头大黑熊，那熊在捉鱼时叫蚊子螫迷糊了，发起脾气来，又狼狈又凶狠地穿过林子。即使如此那也是一场恶战，唤醒了巴克潜在的凶恶本性的残余。两天之后他回到自己杀死的东西面前时，看到十多只黑獾在争抢战利品，他像吹糠一样把那群獾赶走了。有两头黑獾留了下来，不过他们再也不会争抢了。

他对血的渴望比任何时候都强烈了。他是个杀手，是个不依靠帮助独自狩猎以活物为食的杀手。他依靠的是力量与技巧，在弱肉强食的敌对环境中胜利地活了下来。因为这一切他具有了一种自豪感，这种感觉像传染病一样进入了他的机体，在他所有的行动中体现出来，在每一块肌肉的活动中显露出来，在他的姿态中像语言一样说了出来，使他那一身光泽的毛看去更光泽了，若不是他嘴筒上和眼睛上方偶然留下的褐色和沿着胸口正中往下伸展的一大片雪白的毛，他是很可能被误认为一只比所有的大狼还大的巨型狼的。他从他的圣伯纳狗父亲遗传来了身个儿和分量，可是赋予他那身个儿和分量以形象的却是他的牧羊犬母亲。他的嘴是狼的嘴，只是比狼的嘴大；他的头要宽阔得多，是硕大无比的狼头。

他的狡猾是狼的狡猾，野性的狡猾；他的聪明是牧羊犬和圣伯纳犬的聪明。[1]这一切，还加上他在最严酷的学校里获得的经验，使他变成了一只在蛮荒里漫游的最可怕的动物，一只净吃肉的肉食动物，处在最佳的年华，生命的高峰期，浑身洋溢着生气与活力。索恩顿爱抚他的背时，手一摸他便叫，身子便噼啪作响，每一根毛随着抚摸放出潜在的磁力。他的每一部分：头脑、身体、神经和纤维都调试到了最佳的音阶，而各部分之间又有一种充分的平衡与和谐。对于要求动作反应的形象、声音和事件他都能以闪电般的速度做出反应。雪橇狗可以迅速起跳迎敌或进攻，他却比他们还快一倍。一看见动作，一听见声音，他就能做出反应，比别的狗光是看和听还要快。他感知、决定和反应同时完成——实际上这三者是依次完成的，但他的三者之间的间隙太小，因而同时出现。他的肌肉充满了活力，像钢弹簧一样，一弹便出现了猛烈的行动。生命以优秀的洪流流过他全身，愉悦恣肆直到它似乎要因狂欢极乐而爆炸，向世界横流倾泻。

“从来没见过这样的狗。”约翰·索恩顿有一天在伙伴们望着巴克走出营地时说。

“铸成他之后，就把模子砸了。”彼得说。

“说个正着！我也这么想呢。”汉斯加以确认。

他走出营地时，他们是看见的，但他进入森林的隐秘之处时立即发生的可怕变化他们却没有看见。他不再像平常那样前进，而是立即变成了蛮荒中的生物，隐秘地前进。他脚步像猫，成了在种种影像之中出没的一个影像。他知道怎样利用每一种东西做掩护，他像蛇一样肚子贴地前行，也像蛇一样猛然跃起猛然攻击。他可以从窝里抓住一只松鸡，可以趁野兔熟睡时把它杀死，可以跳到空中咬住逃得慢了一秒钟的金花鼠。没结冰的池里的鱼对他不算太快；修理着堤的海狸鼠对他不算太警觉。他杀死，是为了吃，而不是为了杀。他喜欢吃自己杀死的东西。因此他的行动之中便隐藏了一种幽默。为了好玩，他悄悄走到松鼠身边，却又在差不多捉住他们时放掉，吓得他们牙齿打颤，不要命地逃往树梢。

秋日渐深，麋鹿越来越多，他们正缓缓下山到地势较低、气温不那么严酷的地区来迎接冬天。他已经扳倒过一只半大的麋鹿，但他强烈地希望猎取一只较大较凶猛的猎物。这东西他有一天在小河源头的分水岭遇到了。一个有二十来只麋鹿的鹿群从那森林与溪流的土地爬上坡来。他们的首领是一只巨大的公麋鹿，此时正在大发脾气。那鹿站直了有六英尺高，是巴克所能找到的最可怕的对手。公麋鹿摇晃着那一对长成蹼板的大角，那角分成十四叉，角尖距离宽达七英尺。他的小眼睛燃着一种凶狠的仇恨之光，见了巴克便愤怒地咆哮起来。

公麋鹿一胁的前部插着一枝带羽的箭，说明了他发脾气的原因。巴克凭着原始社会古老的狩猎时期的本能，开始设法把公麋鹿跟别的麋鹿分开。这工作很不轻松。他在公鹿前跳蹦吠叫——刚刚在他那巨大的角和可怕的撒开的腿的势力范围之外，那两样东西一碰上是会要命的。由于在这个长了獠牙的危险东西面前无法转身走自己的路，那麋鹿被逼得一阵一阵大发雷霆。他对巴克发起了进攻。巴克狡猾地躲开，却又装出逃不动的样子引诱他进攻。但是他像这样被引诱离群之后，两三只较年青的麋鹿又会回来进攻巴克，保护受伤的公鹿归队。

野生动物有一种耐性——像生命一样顽强、坚定，这种耐性使网里的蜘蛛、盘成圈的蛇和埋伏着的豹长期保持不动，这是猎捕活食的生物所特有的耐性；巴克跟在鹿群一侧阻挡着它的去路，激怒着年青的公鹿，使母鹿和半大的鹿担心，赶得那受了伤的公鹿无可奈何地大发脾气。这一套做法坚持了半天，巴克忽然变成了许多巴克，从四面八方向他们进攻，用旋风一样的威胁包围了鹿群，他的对象一回到鹿群，他就把他赶开，这样消磨着受攻击者的耐性。受攻击者的耐性是不如攻击者的。

白昼慢慢逝去，太阳落进了西北方自己的窝里（黑夜又回来了，秋天的夜长达六小时），年青的公鹿越来越不愿回头来援救他们受到攻击的首领。向南逼来的寒冬正困扰着他们，逼着他们往较低的地区走，可他们又好像永远也摆不脱这一只不知疲倦地阻碍着他们的东西。何况受到威胁的并不是鹿群，也不是年青的鹿。那东西要的不过是一只鹿，那距离要他们的命毕竟还很遥远。最后他们便满足于投降了。

黄昏转为黑暗，老公鹿低下头望着他的伙伴们蹒跚着在逐渐暗淡的阳光中匆匆撤离——他熟识的母鹿，他亲生的小鹿，他指挥过的公鹿。他却无法跟了去，因为这一个长着獠牙的残忍的可怕家伙就在他鼻子前面跳动，不让他走。他体重有半吨加三百磅；他经历过长久的充满战斗与厮杀的日子，他都是那么的强悍，可到最后逼他面对死亡的却是一个小小的动物的牙齿。那东西还没有他关节巨大的膝盖头高。

从此以后无论白天黑夜巴克从没离开过他的猎物；从没让他安静过一会儿；从没让他吃到树叶或嫩枞嫩柳的芽；从没让那受伤的鹿在路过涓涓细流时有机会解除他燃烧一样的烦渴。那鹿发起急来常常跑上很久很久。这时巴克也不去阻挠，只是大步慢跑着跟着他，满足于这场游戏的进程。那鹿停下，他也躺倒，只在那鹿想吃或想喝时向他发起激烈的进攻。

鹿的巨大的脑袋在树枝般的双角重压下越垂越低了，他蹒跚的步子越来越没有力气了。他开始长时间地呆立，鼻子挨着地，耳朵懒洋洋地下垂，而巴克却有更多的时间自己去喝水和休息。在他红色的舌头下垂，眼睛盯住公麋鹿的时候，巴克似乎意识到某种变化已经出现。他能在土地上感到一种新的震动。鹿群来到了这片土地上，还有别的动物也来到了这片土地上。森林、溪流和空气似乎因他们的出现而悸动不安。他感到了这变化，却没有看到听到或嗅到。他是由另一种更为微妙的感觉意识到的。他什么也没听见，什么也没看见，但却知道土地上出现了某种变化。有陌生的东西在土地上往来活动，他决心在办完手边的事之后去了解一下。

终于，在第四天的末尾他把那巨大的麋鹿拖翻了。他在他杀死的东西身边停留了一天一夜，吃了睡，睡了又吃。休息结束时他已恢复了健康和体力，这才转身向营地和约翰·索恩顿跑去。他开始轻松地大步慢跑，一小时一小时地跑下去，从不为复杂的道路所迷惑。他笔直穿过陌生的土地，方向之坚定可以使人类和他们那有魔法的指南针感到惭愧。

他一路跑一路感到了空气中新的震动。除了曾在那儿度过夏天的生命，有了不同的生命在活动。这一事实不再是以某种微妙神秘的方式出现了。鸟儿谈的是它，松鼠叫的是它，连微风也细语着它。他好几次停下脚步大口吸着早上清新的空气，嗅着，读出了某种信息，便加快速度往前蹦跳。一种灾难正在降临的感觉催促着他，若不是已经出现了灾难的话。在他穿过最后的分水岭往山下谷里的营地走去时他变得谨慎了。

他在三英里外发现了一条新踏出的路，不禁鬣毛耸立，簌簌地闪动。那路直通营地和约翰·索恩顿。他匆匆地跑着，又快又隐秘，每一根神经都绷紧了，无穷的细节告诉他确实出了问题，使他警觉——只是还不知道究竟是什么。他的鼻子告诉他有生物走过，而自己却正跟在后面。他注意到林里费人猜疑的寂静。鸟儿全飞走了，松鼠全躲起来了，他只看到一只，一只皮毛光泽的灰松鼠砸扁了，躺在灰色的死树枝上，似乎成了它的一部分——一个树瘤。

巴克像个滑行的影子悄悄行动时，鼻子忽然一震，歪向了一边，仿佛有什么力量劈面而来，拽了它一下。他追踪新的气味来到一个树丛边，看见了尼格。尼格死了，侧卧在他爬到的地方，一枝箭射穿了他，箭镞和羽毛从他身子两面伸出。

在前方一百码处巴克发现了索恩顿在道森买来的一只雪橇狗。那狗还在小路上做垂死挣扎，翻来滚去。巴克没停步，绕过了他。从营地隐约传来杂乱的人声时高时低，有点像唱歌。他肚子贴地来到空地边，发现了汉斯，脸朝下伏在地上，身上满是箭羽，像个刺猬。巴克立即向枞木小屋所在的地方望去，看到了使他的鬣毛与肩毛倒竖的景象。一股难以遏制的愤怒从他身上掠过。他没有意识到自己在咆哮，却已十分凶猛地咆哮开了。这是他平生最后一次让激情压倒了狡狯和理智，他对约翰·索恩顿的爱使他失去了理智。

伊哈人正在被毁掉的枞木小屋前跳舞，忽然听见一种恐怖的吼叫，随即看到一只他们从没见过的奇怪动物向他们扑来。那就是巴克。一股愤怒的生命的旋风向他们疯狂卷去，要毁灭他们。他扑向最前面的人（那人是伊哈人的首领），咬开了他的喉咙，直咬到鲜血从撕破的颈动脉喷出。他没去纠缠这人，咬一口便走掉。第二次跳起他又把另一个人的喉管撕成了个大口子。他所向无敌，在人群之间东扑西咬，不断凶猛地撕着，扯着，破坏着，使射向他的箭不起作用。实际上他的动作敏捷得难以想象，而印第安人又挤成一团，互相妨碍，射出的箭反倒伤害了自己人。一个年青的猎手对着腾空而起的巴克一投枪投去，投枪却狠狠地戳进了另一个猎手的胸脯，枪尖从背后的皮里透了出来。伊哈人吓坏了，混乱了，往树林里逃，一面逃一面叫喊出了邪神。

巴克的确是魔鬼的化身。他紧追印第安人不舍，在他们穿过树林时把他们像鹿一样拖翻。那可是伊哈人不祥的日子，他们只好往野地里四面奔逃，一个礼拜以后最后的幸存者才在下面的峡谷里检点了他们的损失。巴克追得厌了才回到荒凉的营地。他找到了彼得。彼得躺在毛毯里，袭击刚开始就给杀死了。索恩顿曾做过激烈的斗争，地上还留下新鲜的痕迹。巴克把每一个细节都嗅了出来，最后来到了一个深潭边。斯基特躺在潭边，头和前脚浸在水里，忠实到最后的一刻。那潭由于洗矿箱的影响水很浑浊，变了颜色，有效地隐藏了其中的东西——约翰·索恩顿。因为巴克追踪他的足迹到了水里，却再没见足迹从水里出来。

一整天巴克都在潭边沉思或是在营地上心绪不宁地漫游。他知道死亡，那就是再也不会动弹，是生命的消失。他知道约翰·索恩顿死了。他的死给他留下了一个巨大的空白，有点像饥饿，然而是一种不断让他难受的饥饿，食物无法解除的饥饿。有时他停下来研究伊哈人的尸体，便忘了那空白的痛苦，那时他倒感到一种巨大的自豪——比过去一切自豪都要巨大的自豪。他杀了人，杀了最高贵的猎物，他是面对着大棒与獠牙的法律杀掉人的。他好奇地嗅嗅尸体。他们很容易就给杀掉了，比杀掉雪橇狗还容易，若不是有箭有矛有大棒他们根本不是对手。从此以后只要他们没拿弓箭、矛和大棒，他是再也不会怕他们的。

夜渐深沉，一轮满月升上树梢进入天空，照亮了土地，土地沐浴于一种阴森森的白昼之光里。巴克在水潭边沉思和哀悼，随着夜的到来，林中那新的生活又在他心里激动起来——伊哈人所破坏的部分除外。他站起身来，听着，嗅着，辽远处隐约传来了一声尖厉的嚎叫，紧接着是一大片尖厉的嚎叫。随着时间过去，那嚎叫愈来愈密，越来越响亮。巴克明白了，那就是不断在他记忆中出现的另一个世界的声音。他走到空地正中听着。是呼唤，是调子各不相同的呼唤，它比以前任何时候都更有诱惑力，更带强迫性。这一回他却跟以前不同了，他立即准备响应。约翰·索恩顿已经死了，最后的纽带已经断了，他对人和人的要求再也没有了责任。

狼群在迁徙的麋鹿群侧翼猎食，像伊哈人一样，终于跨过了森林和溪流的土地，侵入了巴克的峡谷，他们像一道银色的洪流滚滚而来，进入月光倾泻的空地。巴克在空地中心雕像般站定，一动不动，只等他们到来。狼群悚然了。他是那么平静，那么巨大。出现了顷刻的停顿。一头最勇敢的狼对他扑来。巴克像闪电一样出击，咬断了他的脖子，又一动不动站着，跟刚才一样。被咬的狼在他身后痛苦地翻滚。又是三只狼连续迅猛出击，也都一个一个败下阵来，咬破的喉咙或肩头流着血。

这就足以惹得整个狼群向他扑来了。狼群急于拖翻他，一拥而上，彼此阻碍，乱成一团，巴克惊人的快速与矫捷发挥了极大的作用。他以后腿为圆心旋转撕咬；他同时在各地出现，建成了一道显然是未被攻破的防线；他迅速地旋转着四面出击保卫自己，但是为了不让对方袭击身后，他被迫后退，绕过水潭，进入河床，最后来到了一道高高的碎石河岸，退进三人淘金时所形成的一个直角里，在那里跟狼群周旋，那儿三面都受到保护，只须面对正面的敌人。

他正面作战很有成效，半小时之后狼群失败了，退却了。每只狼都耷拉出了舌头，在月光里露出了残忍的白獠牙。有的狼躺下了，只是头还翘着，耳朵还向前竖起；有的狼还站着，望着他；还有的则跑到水潭边喝水。一条瘦长的长着白毛的狼小心翼翼地走了出来，态度友好。巴克认出他就是曾跟自己一起跑过一天一夜的野生弟兄。那狼轻声呜呜着，巴克也呜呜作答，双方碰了碰鼻子。

这时一只老狼走了出来。他很干瘦，满身伤疤。巴克一龇牙，正要嚎叫，却跟对方嗅了嗅鼻子。这样老狼便坐了下来，鼻子向着月亮，发出了悠长的嚎叫，别的狼也都坐了下来长嚎。现在呼唤已来到了巴克身边，那是再也不会误解的了。他也坐下来悠然长嚎。嚎完，便走出了自己的角落。狼群围了上来，半是友好，半是野蛮地嗅着他。几个领袖发出狼群的吠叫，跳进了树林。狼群也齐声吠叫着跟了去。巴克也跟着去了，跟那野生的弟兄跑在一起，一面奔跑一面吠叫。

巴克的故事到此满可以结束了。若干年后伊哈人注意到大灰狼出现了变化；有的狼头上和嘴上长出了零星的棕毛，还有两道白毛在胸前会合，但比这更值得注意的是，伊哈人传说里有了一只总跑在狼群前面的魔狗。他们怕这只魔狗，因为他比他们更狡猾。严寒的冬天他会到营地来偷东西，偷吃捕兽机上的食物，咬死他们的狗，把他们最优秀的猎手也不放在眼里。

不，故事还更糟糕。有些猎人出去就没有回到营地，有些猎人被部落的人找到时喉头已被凶残地咬开，雪地上留下的足迹比什么狼都大。伊哈人每年秋天追踪麋鹿时有一个峡谷是从不进去的。有些女人在篝火边听说那凶恶的魔狗已选中了那个峡谷定居，便感到悲哀。

可是到了夏天，从那个伊哈人不知道的峡谷总有个客人到来。那是只毛皮闪闪发光的大狼，跟别的狼全一样，也全都不一样。他独自越过那微笑的森林地区来到林中的一块空地。在这儿有一道黄色的东西从腐败的鹿皮袋里泄出，落进地里，那儿蔓草凄迷，积满了腐植土，遮住了黄色，使它见不到太阳。他在这儿沉思一会儿，嚎叫一番，叫得又悠长又伤心，然后离去。

但他并非总是独自行动。冬季的长夜到来，狼群跟随食物进入低谷时，却可以看见他巨大的身影在灰白的月光里或是在漠漠闪动的北极光里领着狼群蹦跳，在他唱着原始世界的歌时他那巨大的喉咙轰轰地响，那就是狼群之歌。

Chapter I Into the Primitive


“Old longings nomadic leap，

Chafing at custom's chain；

Again from its brumal sleep

Wakens the ferine strain.”

Buck did not read the newspapers，or he would have known that trouble was brewing，not alone for himself，but for every tidewater dog，strong of muscle and with warm，long hair，from Puget Sound to San Diego.Because men，groping in the Arctic darkness，had found a yellow metal，and because steamship and transportation companies were booming the find，thousands of men were rushing into the Northland.These men wanted dogs，and the dogs they wanted were heavy dogs，with strong muscles by which to toil，and furry coats to protect them from the frost.

Buck lived at a big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley.Judge Miller's place，it was called.It stood back from the road，half hidden among the trees，through which glimpses could be caught of the wide，cool veranda that ran around its four sides.The house was approached by gravelled driveways which wound about through wide-spreading lawns and under the interlacing boughs of tall poplars.At the rear things were on even a more spacious scale than at the front.There were great stables，where a dozen grooms and boys held forth，rows of vine-clad servants'cottages，an endless and orderly array of outhouses，long grape arbors，green pastures，orchards，and berry patches.Then there was the pumping plant for the artesian well，and the big cement tank where Judge Miller's boys took their morning plunge and kept cool in the hot afternoon.

And over this great demesne Buck ruled.Here he was born，and here he had lived the four years of his life.It was true，there were other dogs，there could not but be other dogs on so vast a place，but they did not count.They came and went，resided in the populous kennels，or lived obscurely in the recesses of the house after the fashion of Toots，the Japanese pug，or Ysabel，the Mexican hairless—strange creatures that rarely put nose out of doors or set foot to ground.On the other hand，there were the fox terriers，a score of them at least，who yelped fearful promises at Toots and Ysabel looking out of the windows at them and protected by a legion of housemaids armed with brooms and mops.

But Buck was neither house dog nor kennel dog.The whole realm was his.He plunged into the swimming tank or went hunting with the Judge's sons；he escorted Mollie and Alice，the Judge's daughters，on long twilight or early morning rambles；on wintry nights he lay at the Judge's feet before the roaring library fire；he carried the Judge's grandsons on his back，or rolled them in the grass，and guarded their footsteps through wild adventures down to the fountain in the stable yard，and even beyond，where the paddocks were，and the berry patches.Among the terriers he stalked imperiously，and Toots and Ysabel he utterly ignored，for he was king—king over all creeping，crawling，flying things of Judge Miller's place，humans included.

His father，Elmo，a huge St.Bernard，had been the Judge's inseparable companion，and Buck bid fair to follow in the way of his father.He was not so large—he weighed only one hundred and forty pounds—for his mother，Shep，had been a Scotch shepherd dog.Nevertheless，one hundred and forty pounds，to which was added the dignity that comes of good living and universal respect，enabled him to carry himself in right royal fashion.During the four years since his puppyhood he had lived the life of a sated aristocrat；he had a fine pride in himself，was even a trifle egotistical，as country gentlemen sometimes become because of their insular situation.But he had saved himself by not becoming a mere pampered house dog.Hunting and kindred outdoor delights had kept down the fat and hardened his muscles；and to him，as to the cold-tubbing races，the love of water had been a tonic and a health preserver.

And this was the manner of dog Buck was in the fall of 1897，when the Klondike strike dragged men from all the world into the frozen North.But Buck did not read the newspapers，and he did not know that Manuel，one of the gardener's helpers，was an undesirable acquaintance.Manuel had one besetting sin.He loved to play Chinese lottery.Also，in his gambling，he had one besetting weakness—faith in a system；and this made his damnation certain.For to play a system requires money，while the wages of a gardener's helper do not lap over the needs of a wife and numerous progeny.

The Judge was at a meeting of the Raisin Growers' Association，and the boys were busy organizing an athletic club，on the memorable night of Manuel's treachery.No one saw him and Buck go off through the orchard on what Buck imagined was merely a stroll.And with the exception of a solitary man，no one saw them arrive at the little flag station known as College Park.This man talked with Manuel，and money chinked between them.

“You might wrap up the goods before you deliver 'm，”the stranger said gruffly，and Manuel doubled a piece of stout rope around Buck's neck under the collar.

“Twist it，an' you'll choke 'm plentee，”said Manuel，and the stranger grunted a ready affirmative.

Buck had accepted the rope with quiet dignity.To be sure，it was an unwonted performance：but he had learned to trust in men he knew，and to give them credit for a wisdom that outreached his own.But when the ends of the rope were placed in the stranger's hands，he growled menacingly.He had merely intimated his displeasure，in his pride believing that to intimate was to command.But to his surprise the rope tightened around his neck，shutting off his breath.In quick rage he sprang at the man，who met him halfway，grappled him close by the throat，and with a deft twist threw him over on his back.Then the rope tightened mercilessly，while Buck struggled in a fury，his tongue lolling out of his mouth and his great chest panting futilely.Never in all his life had he been so vilely treated，and never in all his life had he been so angry.But his strength ebbed，his eyes glazed，and he knew nothing when the train was flagged and the two men threw him into the baggage car.

The next he knew，he was dimly aware that his tongue was hurting and that he was being jolted along in some kind of a conveyance.The hoarse shriek of a locomotive whistling a crossing told him where he was.He had travelled too often with the Judge not to know the sensation of riding in a baggage car.He opened his eyes，and into them came the unbridled anger of a kidnapped king.The man sprang for his throat，but Buck was too quick for him.His jaws closed on the hand，nor did they relax till his senses were choked out of him once more.

“Yep，has fits，”the man said，hiding his mangled hand from the baggageman，who had been attracted by the sounds of struggle.“I'm takin' 'm up for the boss to 'Frisco.A crack dog doctor there thinks that he can cure 'm.”

Concerning that night's ride，the man spoke most eloquently for himself，in a little shed back of a saloon on the San Francisco water front.

“All I get is fifty for it，”he grumbled；“an' I wouldn't do it over for a thousand，cold cash.”

His hand was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief，and the right trouser leg was ripped from knee to ankle.

“How much did the other mug get？”the saloonkeeper demanded.

“A hundred，”was the reply.“Wouldn't take a sou less，so help me.”

“That makes a hundred and fifty，”the saloonkeeper calculated；“and he's worth it，or I'm a squarehead.”

The kidnapper undid the bloody wrappings and looked at his lacerated hand.“If I don't get the hydrophoby—”

“It'll be because you was born to hang，”laughed the saloonkeeper.“Here，lend me a hand before you pull your freight，”he added.

Dazed，suffering intolerable pain from throat and tongue，with the life half throttled out of him，Buck attempted to face his tormentors.But he was thrown down and choked repeatedly，till they succeeded in filing the heavy brass collar from off his neck.Then the rope was removed，and he was flung into a cagelike crate.

There he lay for the remainder of the weary night，nursing his wrath and wounded pride.He could not understand what it all meant.What did they want with him，these strange men？Why were they keeping him pent up in this narrow crate？He did not know why，but he felt oppressed by the vague sense of impending calamity.Several times during the night he sprang to his feet when the shed door rattled open，expecting to see the Judge，or the boys at least.But each time it was the bulging face of the saloon-keeper that peered in at him by the sickly light of a tallow candle.And each time the joyful bark that trembled in Buck's throat was twisted into a savage growl.

But the saloonkeeper let him alone，and in the morning four men entered and picked up the crate.More tormentors，Buck decided，for they were evil-looking creatures，ragged and unkempt；and he stormed and raged at them through the bars.They only laughed and poked sticks at him，which he promptly assailed with his teeth till he realized that that was what they wanted.Whereupon he lay down sullenly and allowed the crate to be lifted into a wagon.Then he，and the crate in which he was imprisoned，began a passage through many hands.Clerks in the express office took charge of him；he was carted about in another wagon；a truck carried him，with an assortment of boxes and parcels，upon a ferry steamer；he was trucked off the steamer into a great railway depot，and finally he was deposited in an express car.

For two days and nights this express car was dragged along at the tail of shrieking locomotives；and for two days and nights Buck neither ate nor drank.In his anger he had met the first advances of the express messengers with growls，and they had retaliated by teasing him.When he flung himself against the bars，quivering and frothing，they laughed at him and taunted him.They growled and barked like detestable dogs，mewed，and flapped their arms and crowed.It was all very silly，he knew；but therefore the more outrage to his dignity，and his anger waxed and waxed.He did not mind the hunger so much，but the lack of water caused him severe suffering and fanned his wrath to fever pitch.For that matter，high-strung and finely sensitive，the ill treatment had flung him into a fever，which was fed by the inflammation of his parched and swollen throat and tongue.

He was glad for one thing：the rope was off his neck.That had given them an unfair advantage；but now that it was off，he would show them.They would never get another rope around his neck.Upon that he was resolved.For two days and nights he neither ate nor drank，and during those two days and nights of torment，he accumulated a fund of wrath that boded ill for whoever first fell foul of him.His eyes turned blood-shot，and he was metamorphosed into a raging fiend.So changed was he that the Judge himself would not have recognized him；and the express messengers breathed with relief when they bundled him off the train at Seattle.

Four men gingerly carried the crate from the wagon into a small，high-walled back yard.A stout man，with a red sweater that sagged generously at the neck，came out and signed the book for the driver.That was the man，Buck divined，the next tormentor，and he hurled himself savagely against the bars.The man smiled grimly，and brought a hatchet and a club.

“You ain't going to take him out now？”the driver asked.

“Sure，”the man replied，driving the hatchet into the crate for a pry.

There was an instantaneous scattering of the four men who had carried it in，and from safe perches on top the wall they prepared to watch the performance.

Buck rushed at the splintering wood，sinking his teeth into it，surging and wrestling with it.Wherever the hatchet fell on the outside，he was there on the inside，snarling and growling，as furiously anxious to get out as the man in the red sweater was calmly intent on getting him out.

“Now，you red-eyed devil，”he said，when he had made an opening sufficient for the passage of Buck's body.At the same time he dropped the hatchet and shifted the club to his right hand.

And Buck was truly a red-eyed devil，as he drew himself together for the spring，hair bristling，mouth foaming，a mad glitter in his blood-shot eyes.Straight at the man he launched his one hundred and forty pounds of fury，surcharged with the pent passion of two days and nights.In mid-air，just as his jaws were about to close on the man，he received a shock that checked his body and brought his teeth together with an agonizing clip.He whirled over，fetching the ground on his back and side.He had never been struck by a club in his life，and did not understand.With a snarl that was part bark and more scream he was again on his feet and launched into the air.And again the shock came and he was brought crushingly to the ground.This time he was aware that it was the club，but his madness knew no caution.A dozen times he charged，and as often the club broke the charge and smashed him down.

After a particularly fierce blow，he crawled to his feet，too dazed to rush.He staggered limply about，the blood flowing from nose and mouth and ears，his beautiful coat sprayed and flecked with bloody slaver.Then the man advanced and deliberately dealt him a frightful blow on the nose.All the pain he had endured was as nothing compared with the exquisite agony of this.With a roar that was almost lionlike in its ferocity，he again hurled himself at the man.But the man，shifting the club from right to left，coolly caught him by the underjaw，at the same time wrenching downward and backward.Buck described a complete circle in the air，and half of another，then crashed to the ground on his head and chest.

For the last time he rushed.The man struck the shrewd blow he had purposely withheld for so long，and Buck crumpled up and went down，knocked utterly senseless.

“He's no slouch at dog-breakin'，that's wot I say，”one of the men on the wall cried enthusiastically.

“Druther break cayuses any day，and twice on Sundays，”was the reply of the driver，as he climbed on the wagon and started the horses.

Buck's senses came back to him，but not his strength.He lay where he had fallen，and from there he watched the man in the red sweater.

“‘Answers to the name of Buck，’”the man soliloquized，quoting from the saloonkeeper's letter，which had announced the consignment of the crate and contents.“Well，Buck，my boy，”he went on in a genial voice，“we've had our little ruction，and the best thing we can do is to let it go at that.You've learned your place，and I know mine.Be a good dog and all'll go well and the goose hang high.Be a bad dog，and I'll whale the stuffin' outa you.Understand？”

As he spoke he fearlessly patted the head he had so mercilessly pounded，and though Buck's hair involuntarily bristled at touch of the hand，he endured it without protest.When the man brought him water he drank eagerly，and later bolted a generous meal of raw meat，chunk by chunk，from the man's hand.

He was beaten（he knew that）；but he was not broken.He saw，once for all，that he stood no chance against a man with a club.He had learned the lesson，and in all his after life he never forgot it.That club was a revelation.It was his introduction to the reign of primitive law，and he met the introduction halfway.The facts of life took on a fiercer aspect；and while he faced that aspect uncowed，he faced it with all the latent cunning of his nature aroused.As the days went by，other dogs came，in crates and at the ends of ropes，some docilely，and some raging and roaring as he had come；and，one and all，he watched them pass under the dominion of the man in the red sweater.Again and again，as he looked at each brutal performance，the lesson was driven home to Buck：a man with a club was a lawgiver，a master to be obeyed，though not necessarily conciliated.Of this last Buck was never guilty，though he did see beaten dogs that fawned upon the man，and wagged their tails，and licked his hand.Also he saw one dog，that would neither conciliate nor obey，finally killed in the struggle for mastery.

Now and again men came，strangers，who talked excitedly，wheedlingly，and in all kinds of fashions to the man in the red sweater.And at such times that money passed between them the strangers took one or more of the dogs away with them.Buck wondered where they went，for they never came back；but the fear of the future was strong upon him，and he was glad each time when he was not selected.

Yet his time came，in the end，in the form of a little weazened man who spat broken English and many strange and uncouth exclamations which Buck could not understand.

“Sacrédam！”he cried，when his eyes lit upon Buck.“Dat one dam bully dog！Eh？How moch？”

“Three hundred，and a present at that，”was the prompt reply of the man in the red sweater.“And seem' it's government money，you ain't got no kick coming，eh，Perrault？”

Perrault grinned.Considering that the price of dogs had been boomed skyward by the unwonted demand，it was not an unfair sum for so fine an animal.The Canadian Government would be no loser，nor would its despatches travel the slower.Perrault knew dogs，and when he looked at Buck he knew that he was one in a thousand—“One in ten t'ousand，”he commented mentally.

Buck saw money pass between them，and was not surprised when Curly，a good-natured Newfoundland，and he were led away by the little weazened man.That was the last he saw of the man in the red sweater，and as Curly and he looked at receding Seattle from the deck of the Narwhal，it was the last he saw of the warm Southland.Curly and he were taken below by Perrault and turned over to a black-faced giant called Francois.Perrault was a French-Canadian，and swarthy；but Francois was a French-Canadian half-breed，and twice as swarthy.They were a new kind of men to Buck（of which he was destined to see many more），and while he developed no affection for them，he nonetheless grew honestly to respect them.He speedily learned that Perrault and Francois were fair men，calm and impartial in administering justice，and too wise in the way of dogs to be fooled by dogs.

In the 'tween decks of the Narwhal，Buck and Curly joined two other dogs.One of them was a big，snow-white fellow from Spitzbergen who had been brought away by a whaling captain，and who had later accompanied a Geological Survey into the Barrens.He was friendly，in a treacherous sort of way，smiling into one's face the while he meditated some underhand trick，as，for instance，when he stole from Buck's food at the first meal.As Buck sprang to punish him，the lash of Francois's whip sang through the air，reaching the culprit first；and nothing remained to Buck but to recover the bone.That was fair of Francois，he decided，and the half-breed began his rise in Buck's estimation.

The other dog made no advances，nor received any；also，he did not attempt to steal from the newcomers.He was a gloomy，morose fellow，and he showed Curly plainly that all he desired was to be left alone，and further，that there would be trouble if he were not left alone.“Dave”he was called，and he ate and slept，or yawned between times，and took interest in nothing，not even when the Narwhalcrossed Queen Charlotte Sound and rolled and pitched and bucked like a thing possessed.When Buck and Curly grew excited，half wild with fear，he raised his head as though annoyed，favored them with an incurious glance，yawned，and went to sleep again.

Day and night the ship throbbed to the tireless pulse of the propeller，and though one day was very like another，it was apparent to Buck that the weather was steadily growing colder.At last，one morning，the propeller was quiet，and the Narwhalwas pervaded with an atmosphere of excitement.He felt it，as did the other dogs，and knew that a change was at hand.Francois leashed them and brought them on deck.At the first step upon the cold surface，Buck's feet sank into a white mushy something very like mud.He sprang back with a snort.More of this white stuff was falling through the air.He shook himself，but more of it fell upon him.He sniffed it curiously，then licked some up on his tongue.It bit like fire，and the next instant was gone.This puzzled him.He tried it again，with the same result.The onlookers laughed uproariously，and he felt ashamed，he knew not why，for it was his first snow.





Chapter II The Law of Club and Fang


Buck's first day on the Dyea beach was like a nightmare.Every hour was filled with shock and surprise.He had been suddenly jerked from the heart of civilization and flung into the heart of things primordial.No lazy，sun-kissed life was this，with nothing to do but loaf and be bored.Here was neither peace，nor rest，nor a moment's safety.All was confusion and action，and every moment life and limb were in peril.There was imperative need to be constantly alert；for these dogs and men were not town dogs and men.They were savages，all of them，who knew no law but the law of club and fang.

He had never seen dogs fight as these wolfish creatures fought，and his first experience taught him an unforgetable lesson.It is true，it was a vicarious experience，else he would not have lived to profit by it.Curly was the victim.They were camped near the log store，where she，in her friendly way，made advances to a husky dog the size of a full-grown wolf，though not half so large as she.There was no warning，only a leap in like a flash，a metallic clip of teeth，a leap out equally swift，and Curly's face was ripped open from eye to jaw.

It was the wolf manner of fighting，to strike and leap away；but there was more to it than this.Thirty or forty huskies ran to the spot and surrounded the combatants in an intent and silent circle.Buck did not comprehend that silent intentness，nor the eager way with which they were licking their chops.Curly rushed her antagonist，who struck again and leaped aside.He met her next rush with his chest，in a peculiar fashion that tumbled her off her feet.She never regained them，This was what the onlooking huskies had waited for.They closed in upon her，snarling and yelping，and she was buried，screaming with agony，beneath the bristling mass of bodies.

So sudden was it，and so unexpected，that Buck was taken aback.He saw Spitz run out his scarlet tongue in a way he had of laughing；and he saw Francois，swinging an axe，spring into the mess of dogs.Three men with clubs were helping him to scatter them.It did not take long.Two minutes from the time Curly went down，the last of her assailants were clubbed off.But she lay there limp and lifeless in the bloody，trampled snow，almost literally torn to pieces，the swart half-breed standing over her and cursing horribly.The scene often came back to Buck to trouble him in his sleep.So that was the way.No fair play.Once down，that was the end of you.Well，he would see to it that he never went down.Spitz ran out his tongue and laughed again，and from that moment Buck hated him with a bitter and deathless hatred.

Before he had recovered from the shock caused by the tragic passing of Curly，he received another shock.Francois fastened upon him an arrangement of straps and buckles.It was a harness，such as he had seen the grooms put on the horses at home.And as he had seen horses work，so he was set to work，hauling Francois on a sled to the forest that fringed the valley，and returning with a load of firewood.Though his dignity was sorely hurt by thus being made a draught animal，he was too wise to rebel.He buckled down with a will and did his best，though it was all new and strange.Francois was stern，demanding instant obedience，and by virtue of his whip receiving instant obedience；while Dave，who was an experienced wheeler，nipped Buck's hind quarters whenever he was in error.Spitz was the leader，likewise experienced，and while he could not always get at Buck，he growled sharp reproof now and again，or cunningly threw his weight in the traces to jerk Buck into the way he should go.Buck learned easily，and under the combined tuition of his two mates and Francois made remarkable progress.Ere they returned to camp he knew enough to stop at “ho”to go ahead，at “mush”to swing wide on the bends，and to keep clear of the wheeler when the loaded sled shot downhill at their heels.

“T'ree vair' good dogs，”Francois told Perrault.“Dat Buck，heem pool lak hell.I tich heem queek as anyt'ing.”

By afternoon，Perrault，who was in a hurry to be on the trail with his despatches，returned with two more dogs.“Billee”and “Joe”he called them，two brothers，and true huskies both.Sons of the one mother though they were，they were as different as day and night.Billee's one fault was his excessive good nature，while Joe was the very opposite，sour and introspective，with a perpetual snarl and a malignant eye.Buck received them in comradely fashion，Dave ignored them，while Spitz proceeded to thrash first one and then the other.Billee wagged his tail appeasingly，turned to run when he saw that appeasement was of no avail，and cried（still appeasingly）when Spitz's sharp teeth scored his flank.But no matter how Spitz circled，Joe whirled around on his heels to face him，mane bristling，ears laid back，lips writhing and snarling，jaws clipping together as fast as he could snap，and eyes diabolically gleaming—the incarnation of belligerent fear.So terrible was his appearance that Spitz was forced to forego disciplining him；but to cover his own discomfiture he turned upon the inoffensive and wailing Billee and drove him to the confines of the camp.

By evening Perrault secured another dog，an old husky，long and lean and gaunt，with a battle-scarred face and a single eye which flashed a warning of prowess that commanded respect.He was called Sol-leks，which means the Angry One.Like Dave，he asked nothing，gave nothing，expected nothing；and when he marched slowly and deliberately into their midst，even Spitz left him alone.He had one peculiarity which Buck was unlucky enough to discover.He did not like to be approached on his blind side.Of this offence Buck was unwittingly guilty，and the first knowledge he had of his indiscretion was when Sol-leks whirled upon him and slashed his shoulder to the bone for three inches up and down.Forever after Buck avoided his blind side，and to the last of their comradeship had no more trouble.His only apparent ambition，like Dave's，was to be left alone；though，as Buck was afterward to learn，each of them possessed one other and even more vital ambition.

That night Buck faced the great problem of sleeping.The tent，illumined by a candle，glowed warmly in the midst of the white plain；and when he，as a matter of course，entered it，both Perrault and Francois bombarded him with curses and cooking utensils，till he recovered from his consternation and fled ignominiously into the outer cold.A chill wind was blowing that nipped him sharply and bit with especial venom into his wounded shoulder.He lay down on the snow and attempted to sleep，but the frost soon drove him shivering to his feet.Miserable and disconsolate，he wandered about among the many tents，only to find that one place was as cold as another.Here and there savage dogs rushed upon him，but he bristled his neck-hair and snarled（for he was learning fast），and they let him go his way unmolested.

Finally an idea came to him.He would return and see how his own teammates were making out.To his astonishment，they had disappeared.Again he wandered about through the great camp，looking for them，and again he returned.Were they in the tent？No，that could not be，else he would not have been driven out.Then where could they possibly be？With drooping tail and shivering body，very forlorn indeed，he aimlessly circled the tent.Suddenly the snow gave way beneath his fore legs and he sank down.Something wriggled under his feet.He sprang back，bristling and snarling，fearful of the unseen and unknown.But a friendly little yelp reassured him，and he went back to investigate.A whiff of warm air ascended to his nostrils，and there，curled up under the snow in a snug ball，lay Billee.He whined placatingly，squirmed and wriggled to show his good will and intentions，and even ventured，as a bribe for peace，to lick Buck's face with his warm wet tongue.

Another lesson.So that was the way they did it，eh？Buck confidently selected a spot，and with much fuss and waste effort proceeded to dig a hole for himself.In a trice the heat from his body filled the confined space and he was asleep.The day had been long and arduous，and he slept soundly and comfortably，though he growled and barked and wrestled with bad dreams.

Nor did he open his eyes till roused by the noises of the waking camp.At first he did not know where he was.It had snowed during the night and he was completely buried.The snow walls pressed him on every side，and a great surge of fear swept through him—the fear of the wild thing for the trap.It was a token that he was harking back through his own life to the lives of his forebears；for he was a civilized dog，an unduly civilized dog，and of his own experience knew no trap and so could not of himself fear it.The muscles of his whole body contracted spasmodically and instinctively，the hair on his neck and shoulders stood on end，and with a ferocious snarl he bounded straight up into the blinding day，the snow flying about him in a flashing cloud.Ere he landed on his feet，he saw the white camp spread out before him and knew where he was and remembered all that had passed from the time he went for a stroll with Manuel to the hole he had dug for himself the night before.

A shout from Francois hailed his appearance.“Wot I say？”the dog driver cried to Perrault.“Dat Buck for sure learn queek as anyt'ing.”

Perrault nodded gravely.As courier for the Canadian Government，bearing important despatches，he was anxious to secure the best dogs，and he was particularly gladdened by the possession of Buck.

Three more huskies were added to the team inside an hour，making a total of nine，and before another quarter of an hour had passed they were in harness and swinging up the trail toward the Dyea Canon.Buck was glad to be gone，and though the work was hard he found he did not particularly despise it.He was surprised at the eagerness which animated the whole team and which was communicated to him；but still more surprising was the change wrought in Dave and Sol-leks.They were new dogs，utterly transformed by the harness.All passiveness and unconcern had dropped from them.They were alert and active，anxious that the work should go well，and fiercely irritable with whatever，by delay or confusion，retarded that work.The toil of the traces seemed the supreme expression of their being，and all that they lived for and the only thing in which they took delight.

Dave was wheeler or sled dog，pulling in front of him was Buck，then came Sol-leks；the rest of the team was strung out ahead，single file，to the leader，which position was filled by Spitz.

Buck had been purposely placed between Dave and Sol-leks so that he might receive instruction.Apt scholar that he was，they were equally apt teachers，never allowing him to linger long in error，and enforcing their teaching with their sharp teeth.Dave was fair and very wise.He never nipped Buck without cause，and he never failed to nip him when he stood in need of it.As Francois's whip backed him up，Buck found it to be cheaper to mend his ways than to retaliate.Once，during a brief halt，when he got tangled in the traces and delayed the start，both Dave and Solleks flew at him and administered a sound trouncing.The resulting tangle was even worse，but Buck took good care to keep the traces clear thereafter；and ere the day was done，so well had he mastered his work，his mates about ceased nagging him.Francois' whip snapped less frequently，and Perrault even honored Buck by lifting up his feet and carefully examining them.

It was a hard day's run，up the Canon，through Sheep Camp，past the Scales and the timber line，across glaciers and snowdrifts hundreds of feet deep，and over the great Chilcoot Divide，which stands between the salt water and the fresh and guards forbiddingly the sad and lonely North.They made good time down the chain of lakes which fills the craters of extinct volcanoes，and late that night pulled into the huge camp at the head of Lake Bennett，where thousands of goldseekers were building boats against the break-up of the ice in the spring.Buck made his hole in the snow and slept the sleep of the exhausted just，but all too early was routed out in the cold darkness and harnessed with his mates to the sled.

That day they made forty miles，the trail being packed；but the next day，and for many days to follow，they broke their own trail，worked harder，and made poorer time.As a rule，Perrault travelled ahead of the team，packing the snow with webbed shoes to make it easier for them.Francois，guiding the sled at the gee pole，sometimes exchanged places with him，but not often.Perrault was in a hurry，and he prided himself on his knowledge of ice，which knowledge was indispensable，for the fall ice was very thin，and where there was swift water，there was no ice at all.

Day after day，for days unending，Buck toiled in the traces.Always，they broke camp in the dark，and the first gray of dawn found them hitting the trail with fresh miles reeled off behind them.And always they pitched camp after dark，eating their bit of fish，and crawling to sleep into the snow.Buck was ravenous.The pound and a half of sun-dried salmon，which was his ration for each day，seemed to go nowhere.He never had enough，and suffered from perpetual hunger pangs.Yet the other dogs，because they weighed less and were born to the life，received a pound only of the fish and managed to keep in good condition.

He swiftly lost the fastidiousness which had characterized his old life.A dainty eater，he found that his mates，finishing first，robbed him of his unfinished ration.There was no defending it.While he was fighting off two or three，it was disappearing down the throats of the others.To remedy this，he ate as fast as they；and，so greatly did hunger compel him，he was not above taking what did not belong to him.He watched and learned.When he saw Pike，one of the new dogs，a clever malingerer and thief，slyly steal a slice of bacon when Perrault's back was turned，he duplicated the performance the following day，getting away with the whole chunk.A great uproar was raised，but he was unsuspected；while Dub，an awkward blunderer who was always getting caught，was punished for Buck's misdeed.

This first theft marked Buck as fit to survive in the hostile Northland environment.It marked his adaptability，his capacity to adjust himself to changing conditions，the lack of which would have meant swift and terrible death.It marked，further，the decay or going to pieces of his moral nature，a vain thing and a handicap in the ruthless struggle for existence.It was all well enough in the Southland，under the law of love and fellowship，to respect private property and personal feelings；but in the Northland，under the law of club and fang，whoso took such things into account was a fool，and in so far as he observed them he would fail to prosper.

Not that Buck reasoned it out.He was fit，that was all，and unconsciously he accommodated himself to the new mode of life.All his days，no matter what the odds，he had never run from a fight.But the club of the man in the red sweater had beaten into him a more fundamental and primitive code.Civilized，he could have died for a moral consideration，say the defence of Judge Miller's riding whip；but the completeness of his decivilization was now evidenced by his ability to flee from the defence of a moral consideration and so save his hide.He did not steal for joy of it，but because of the clamor of his stomach.He did not rob openly，but stole secretly and cunningly，out of respect for club and fang.In short，the things he did were done because it was easier to do them than not to do them.

His development（or retrogression）was rapid.His muscles became hard as iron，and he grew callous to all ordinary pain.He achieved an internal as well as external economy.He could eat anything，no matter how loathsome or indigestible；and，once eaten，the juices of his stomach extracted the last least particle of nutriment；and his blood carried it to the farthest reaches of his body，building it into the toughest and stoutest of tissues.Sight and scent became remarkably keen，while his hearing developed such acuteness that in his sleep he heard the faintest sound and knew whether it heralded peace or peril.He learned to bite the ice out with his teeth when it collected between his toes；and when he was thirsty and there was a thick scum of ice over the water hole，he would break it by rearing and striking it with stiff fore legs.His most conspicuous trait was an ability to scent the wind and forecast it a night in advance.No matter how breathless the air when he dug his nest by tree or bank，the wind that later blew inevitably found him to leeward，sheltered and snug.

And not only did he learn by experience，but instincts long dead became alive again.The domesticated generations fell from him.In vague ways he remembered back to the youth of the breed，to the time the wild dogs ranged in packs through the primeval forest and killed their meat as they ran it down.It was no task for him to learn to fight with cut and slash and the quick wolf snap.In this manner had fought forgotten ancestors.They quickened the old life within him，and the old tricks which they had stamped into the heredity of the breed were his tricks.They came to him without effort or discovery，as though they had been his always.And when，on the still cold nights，he pointed his nose at a star and howled long and wolflike，it was his ancestors，dead and dust，pointing nose at star and howling down through the centuries and through him.And his cadences were their cadences，the cadences which voiced their woe and what to them was the meaning of the stiffness，and the cold，and dark.

Thus，as token of what a puppet thing life is，the ancient song surged through him and he came into his own again；and he came because men had found a yellow metal in the North，and because Manuel was a gardener's helper whose wages did not lap over the needs of his wife and divers small copies of himself.





Chapter III The Dominant Primordial Beast


The dominant primordial beast was strong in Buck，and under the fierce conditions of trail life it grew and grew.Yet it was a secret growth.His newborn cunning gave him poise and control.He was too busy adjusting himself to the new life to feel at ease，and not only did he not pick fights，but he avoided them whenever possible.A certain deliberateness characterized his attitude.He was not prone to rashness and precipitate action；and in the bitter hatred between him and Spitz he betrayed no impatience，shunned all offensive acts.

On the other hand，possibly because he divined in Buck a dangerous rival，Spitz never lost an opportunity of showing his teeth.He even went out of his way to bully Buck，striving constantly to start the fight which could end only in the death of one or the other.Early in the trip this might have taken place had it not been for an unwonted accident.At the end of this day they made a bleak and miserable camp on the shore of Lake Le Barge.Driving snow，a wind that cut like a white-hot knife，and darkness had forced them to grope for a camping place.They could hardly have fared worse.At their backs rose a perpendicular wall of rock，and Perrault and Francois were compelled to make their fire and spread their sleeping robes on the ice of the lake itself.The tent they had discarded at Dyea in order to travel light.A few sticks of driftwood furnished them with a fire that thawed down through the ice and left them to eat supper in the dark.

Close in under the sheltering rock Buck made his nest.So snug and warm was it，that he was loath to leave it when Francois distributed the fish which he had first thawed over the fire.But when Buck finished his ration and returned，he found his nest occupied.A warning snarl told him that the trespasser was Spitz.Till now Buck had avoided trouble with his enemy，but this was too much.The beast in him roared.He sprang upon Spitz with a fury which surprised them both，and Spitz particularly，for his whole experience with Buck had gone to teach him that his rival was an unusually timid dog，who managed to hold his own only because of his great weight and size.

Francois was surprised，too，when they shot out in a tangle from the disrupted nest and he divined the cause of the trouble.“A-a-ah！”he cried to Buck.“Gif it to heem，by Gar！Gif it to heem，the dirty t'eef！”

Spitz was equally willing.He was crying with sheer rage and eagerness as he circled back and forth for a chance to spring in.Buck was no less eager，and no less cautious，as he likewise circled back and forth for the advantage.But it was then that the unexpected happened，the thing which projected their struggle for supremacy far into the future，past many a weary mile of trail and toil.

An oath from Perrault，the resounding impact of a club upon a bony frame，and a shrill yelp of pain，heralded the breaking forth of pandemonium.The camp was suddenly discovered to be alive with skulking furry forms—starving huskies，four or five score of them，who had scented the camp from some Indian village.They had crept in while Buck and Spitz were fighting，and when the two men sprang among them with stout clubs they showed their teeth and fought back.They were crazed by the smell of the food.Perrault found one with head buried in the grub box.His club landed heavily on the gaunt ribs，and the grub box was capsized on the ground.On the instant a score of the famished brutes were scrambling for the bread and bacon.The clubs fell upon them unheeded.They yelped and howled under the rain of blows，but struggled none the less madly till the last crumb had been devoured.

In the meantime the astonished team dogs had burst out of their nests only to be set upon by the fierce invaders.Never had Buck seen such dogs.It seemed as though their bones would burst through their skins.They were mere skeletons，draped loosely in draggled hides，with blazing eyes and slavered fangs.But the hunger madness made them terrifying，irresistible.There was no opposing them.The team dogs were swept back against the cliff at the first onset.Buck was beset by three huskies，and in a trice his head and shoulders were ripped and slashed.The din was frightful.Billee was crying as usual.Dave and Sol-leks，dripping blood from a score of wounds，were fighting bravely side by side.Joe was snapping like a demon.Once，his teeth closed on the fore leg of a husky，and he crunched down through the bone.Pike，the malingerer，leaped upon the crippled animal，breaking its neck with a quick flash of teeth and a jerk，Buck got a frothing adversary by the throat，and was sprayed with blood when his teeth sank through the jugular.The warm taste of it in his mouth goaded him to greater fierceness.He flung himself upon another，and at the same time felt teeth sink into his own throat.It was Spitz，treacherously attacking from the side.

Perrault and Francois，having cleaned out their part of the camp，hurried to save their sled dogs.The wild wave of famished beasts rolled back before them，and Buck shook himself free.But it was only for a moment.The two men were compelled to run back to save the grub，upon which the huskies returned to the attack on the team.Billee，terrified into bravery，sprang through the savage circle and fled away over the ice.Pike and Dub followed on his heels，with the rest of the team behind.As Buck drew himself together to spring after them，out of the tail of his eye he saw Spitz rush upon him with the evident intention of overthrowing him.Once off his feet and under that mass of huskies，there was no hope for him.But he braced himself to the shock of Spitz's charge，then joined the flight out on the lake.

Later，the nine team dogs gathered together and sought shelter in the forest.Though unpursued，they were in a sorry plight.There was not one who was not wounded in four or five places，while some were wounded grievously.Dub was badly injured in a hind leg；Dolly，the last husky added to the team at Dyea，had a badly torn throat；Joe had lost an eye；while Billee，the good-natured，with an ear chewed and rent to ribbons，cried and whimpered throughout the night.At daybreak they limped warily back to camp，to find the marauders gone and the two men in bad tempers.Fully half their grub supply was gone.The huskies had chewed through the sled lashings and canvas coverings.In fact，nothing，no matter how remotely eatable，had escaped them.They had eaten a pair of Perrault's moose-hide moccasins，chunks out of the leather traces，and even two feet of lash from the end of Francois' whip.He broke from a mournful contemplation of it to look over his wounded dogs.

“Ah，my frien's，”he said softly，“mebbe it mek you mad dog，dose many bites.Mebbe all mad dog，sacrédam！Wot you t'ink，eh，Perrault？”

The courier shook his head dubiously.With four hundred miles of trail still between him and Dawson，he could ill afford to have madness break out among his dogs.Two hours of cursing and exertion got the harnesses into shape，and the wound-stiffened team was under way，struggling painfully over the hardest part of the trail they had yet encountered，and for that matter，the hardest between them and Dawson.

The Thirty Mile River was wide open.Its wild water defied the frost，and it was in the eddies only and in the quiet places that the ice held at all.Six days of exhausting toil were required to cover those thirty terrible miles.And terrible they were，for every foot of them was accomplished at the risk of life to dog and man.A dozen times，Perrault，nosing the way broke through the ice bridges，being saved by the long pole he carried，which he so held that it fell each time across the hole made by his body.But a cold snap was on，the thermometer registering fifty below zero，and each time he broke through he was compelled for very life to build a fire and dry his garments.

Nothing daunted him.It was because nothing daunted him that he had been chosen for government courier.He took all manner of risks，resolutely thrusting his little weazened face into the frost and struggling on from dim dawn to dark.He skirted the frowning shores on rim ice that bent and crackled under foot and upon which they dared not halt.Once，the sled broke through，with Dave and Buck，and they were half-frozen and all but drowned by the time they were dragged out.The usual fire was necessary to save them.They were coated solidly with ice，and the two men kept them on the run around the fire，sweating and thawing，so close that they were singed by the flames.

At another time Spitz went through，dragging the whole team after him up to Buck，who strained backward with all his strength，his fore- paws on the slippery edge and the ice quivering and snapping all around.But behind him was Dave，likewise straining backward，and behind the sled was Francois，pulling till his tendons cracked.

Again，the rim ice broke away before and behind，and there was no escape except up the cliff.Perrault scaled it by a miracle，while Francois prayed for just that miracle；and with every thong and sled lashing and the last bit of harness rove into a long rope，the dogs were hoisted，one by one，to the cliff crest.Francois came up last，after the sled and load.Then came the search for a place to descend，which descent was ultimately made by the aid of the rope，and night found them back on the river with a quarter of a mile to the day's credit.

By the time they made the Hootalinqua and good ice，Buck was played out.The rest of the dogs were in like condition；but Perrault，to make up lost time，pushed them late and early.The first day they covered thirty-five miles to the Big Salmon；the next day thirty-five more to the Little Salmon；the third day forty miles，which brought them well up toward the Five Fingers.

Buck's feet were not so compact and hard as the feet of the huskies.His had softened during the many generations since the day his last wild ancestor was tamed by a cave dweller or river man.All day long he limped in agony，and camp once made，lay down like a dead dog.Hungry as he was，he would not move to receive his ration of fish，which Francois had to bring to him.Also，the dog driver rubbed Buck's feet for half an hour each night after supper，and sacrificed the tops of his own moccasins to make four moccasins for Buck.This was a great relief，and Buck caused even the weazened face of Perrault to twist itself into a grin one morning，when Francois forgot the moccasins and Buck lay on his back，his four feet waving appealingly in the air，and refused to budge without them.Later his feet grew hard to the trail，and the worn-out foot-gear was thrown away.

At the Pelly one morning，as they were harnessing up，Dolly，who had never been conspicuous for anything，went suddenly mad.She announced her condition by a long，heartbreaking wolf howl that sent every dog bristling with fear，then sprang straight for Buck.He had never seen a dog go mad，nor did he have any reason to fear madness；yet he knew that here was horror，and fled away from it in a panic.Straight away he raced，with Dolly，panting and frothing，one leap behind；nor could she gain on him，so great was his terror，nor could he leave her，so great was her madness.He plunged through the wooded breast of the island，flew down to the lower end，crossed a back channel filled with rough ice to another island，gained a third island，curved back to the main river，and in desperation started to cross it.And all the time，though he did not look，he could hear her snarling just one leap behind.Francois called to him a quarter of a mile away and he doubled back，still one leap ahead，gasping painfully for air and putting all his faith in that Francois would save him.The dog-driver held the axe poised in his hand，and as Buck shot past him the axe crashed down upon mad Dolly's head.

Buck staggered over against the sled，exhausted，sobbing for breath，helpless.This was Spitz's opportunity.He sprang upon Buck，and twice his teeth sank into his unresisting foe and ripped and tore the flesh to the bone.Then Francois' lash descended，and Buck had the satisfaction of watching Spitz receive the worst whipping as yet administered to any of the teams.

“One devil，dat Spitz，”remarked Perrault.“Some dam' day heem keel dat Buck.”

“Dat Buck two devils，”was Francois's rejoinder.“All de tam I watch dat Buck I know for sure.Lissen：some dam' fine day heem get mad lak hell an' den heem chew dat Spitz all up an' spit heem out on de snow.Sure.I know.”

From then on it was war between them.Spitz，as lead dog and acknowledged master of the team，felt his supremacy threatened by this strange Southland dog.And strange Buck was to him，for of the many Southland dogs he had known，not one had shown up worthily in camp and on trail.They were all too soft，dying under the toil，the frost，and starvation.Buck was the exception.He alone endured and prospered，matching the husky in strength，savagery，and cunning.Then he was a masterful dog，and what made him dangerous was the fact that the club of the man in the red sweater had knocked all blind pluck and rashness out of his desire for mastery.He was pre-eminently cunning，and could bide his time with a patience that was nothing less than primitive.

It was inevitable that the clash for leadership should come.Buck wanted it.He wanted it because it was his nature，because he had been gripped tight by that nameless，incomprehensible pride of the trail and trace—that pride which holds dogs in the toil to the last gasp，which lures them to die joyfully in the harness，and breaks their hearts if they are cut out of the harness.This was the pride of Dave as wheel dog，of Sol-leks as he pulled with all his strength；the pride that laid hold of them at break of camp，transforming them from sour and sullen brutes into straining，eager，ambitious creatures；the pride that spurred them on all day and dropped them at pitch of camp at night，letting them fall back into gloomy unrest and uncontent.This was the pride that bore up Spitz and made him thrash the sled dogs who blundered and shirked in the traces or hid away at harness-up time in the morning.Likewise it was this pride that made him fear Buck as a possible lead dog.And this was Buck's pride，too.

He openly threatened the other's leadership.He came between him and the shirks he should have punished.And he did it deliberately.One night there was a heavy snowfall，and in the morning Pike，the malingerer，did not appear.He was securely hidden in his nest under a foot of snow.Francois called him and sought him in vain.Spitz was wild with wrath.He raged through the camp，smelling and digging in every likely place，snarling so frightfully that Pike heard and shivered in his hiding place.

But when he was at last unearthed，and Spitz flew at him to punish him，Buck flew，with equal rage，in between.So unexpected was it，and so shrewdly managed，that Spitz was hurled backward and off his feet.Pike，who had been trembling abjectly，took heart at this open mutiny，and sprang upon his overthrown leader.Buck，to whom fair play was a forgotten code，likewise sprang upon Spitz.But Francois，chuckling at the incident while unswerving in the administration of justice，brought his lash down upon Buck with all his might.This failed to drive Buck from his prostrate rival，and the butt of the whip was brought into play.Half-stunned by the blow，Buck was knocked backward and the lash laid upon him again and again，while Spitz soundly punished the many times-offending Pike.

In the days that followed，as Dawson grew closer and closer，Buck still continued to interfere between Spitz and the culprits；but he did it craftily，when Francois was not around.With the covert mutiny of Buck，a general insubordination sprang up and increased.Dave and Sol-leks were unaffected，but the rest of the team went from bad to worse.Things no longer went right.There was continual bickering and jangling.Trouble was always afoot，and at the bottom of it was Buck.He kept Francois busy，for the dog driver was in constant apprehension of the life-and-death struggle between the two which he knew must take place sooner or later；and on more than one night the sounds of quarrelling and strife among the other dogs turned him out of his sleeping robe，fearful that Buck and Spitz were at it.

But the opportunity did not present itself，and they pulled into Dawson one dreary afternoon with the great fight still to come.Here were many men，and countless dogs，and Buck found them all at work.It seemed the ordained order of things that dogs should work.All day they swung up and down the main street in long teams，and in the night their jingling bells still went by.They hauled cabin logs and firewood，freighted up to the mines，and did all manner of work that horses did in the Santa Clara Valley.Here and there Buck met Southland dogs，but in the main they were the wild wolf husky breed.Every night，regularly，at nine，at twelve，at three，they lifted a nocturnal song，a weird and eerie chant，in which it was Buck's delight to join.

With the aurora borealis flaming coldly overhead，or the stars leaping in the frost dance，and the land numb and frozen under its pall of snow，this song of the huskies might have been the defiance of life，only it was pitched in minor key，with long-drawn wailings and half-sobs，and was more the pleading of life，the articulate travail of existence.It was an old song，old as the breed itself—one of the first songs of the younger world in a day when songs were sad.It was invested with the woe of unnumbered generations，this plaint by which Buck was so strangely stirred.When he moaned and sobbed，it was with the pain of living that was of old the pain of his wild fathers，and the fear and mystery of the cold and dark that was to them fear and mystery.And that he should be stirred by it marked the completeness with which he harked back through the ages of fire and roof to the raw beginnings of life in the howling ages.

Seven days from the time they pulled into Dawson，they dropped down the steep bank by the Barracks to the Yukon Trail，and pulled for Dyea and Salt Water.Perrault was carrying despatches if anything more urgent than those he had brought in；also，the travel pride had gripped him，and he purposed to make the record trip of the year.Several things favored him in this.The week's rest had recuperated the dogs and put them in thorough trim.The trail they had broken into the country was packed hard by later journeyers.And further，the police had arranged in two or three places deposits of grub for dog and man，and he was travelling light.

They made Sixty Mile，which is a fifty-mile run，on the first day；and the second day saw them booming up the Yukon well on their way to Pelly.But such splendid running was achieved not without great trouble and vexation on the part of Francois.The insidious revolt led by Buck had destroyed the solidarity of the team.It no longer was as one dog leaping in the traces.The encouragement Buck gave the rebels led them into all kinds of petty misdemeanors.No more was Spitz a leader greatly to be feared.The old awe departed，and they grew equal to challenging his authority.Pike robbed him of half a fish one night，and gulped it down under the protection of Buck.Another night Dub and Joe fought Spitz and made him forego the punishment they deserved.And even Billee，the good-natured，was less good-natured，and whined not half so placatingly as in former days.Buck never came near Spitz without snarling and bristling menacingly.In fact，his conduct approached that of a bully，and he was given to swaggering up and down before Spitz's very nose.

The breaking down of discipline likewise affected the dogs in their relations with one another.They quarrelled and bickered more than ever among themselves，till at times the camp was a howling bedlam.Dave and Sol-leks alone were unaltered，though they were made irritable by the unending squabbling.Francois swore strange barbarous oaths，and stamped the snow in futile rage，and tore his hair.His lash was always singing among the dogs，but it was of small avail.Directly his back was turned they were at it again.He backed up Spitz with his whip，while Buck backed up the remainder of the team.Francois knew he was behind all the trouble，and Buck knew he knew；but Buck was too clever ever again to be caught red-handed.He worked faithfully in the harness，for the toil had become a delight to him；yet it was a greater delight slyly to precipitate a fight amongst his mates and tangle the traces.

At the mouth of the Tahkeena，one night after supper，Dub turned up a snowshoe rabbit，blundered it，and missed.In a second the whole team was in full cry.A hundred yards away was a camp of the Northwest Police，with fifty dogs，huskies all，who joined the chase.The rabbit sped down the river，turned off into a small creek，up the frozen bed of which it held steadily.It ran lightly on the surface of the snow，while the dogs ploughed through by main strength.Buck led the pack，sixty strong，around bend after bend，but he could not gain.He lay down low to the race，whining eagerly，his splendid body flashing forward，leap by leap，in the wan white moonlight.And leap by leap，like some pale frost wraith，the snowshoe rabbit flashed on ahead.

All that stirring of old instincts which at stated periods drives men out from the sounding cities to forest and plain to kill things by chemically propelled leaden pellets，the blood lust，the joy to kill—all this was Buck's，only it was infinitely more intimate.He was ranging at the head of the pack，running the wild thing down，the living meat，to kill with his own teeth and wash his muzzle to the eyes in warm blood.

There is an ecstasy that marks the summit of life，and beyond which life cannot rise.And such is the paradox of living，this ecstasy comes when one is most alive，and it comes as a complete forgetfulness that one is alive.This ecstasy，this forgetfulness of living，comes to the artist，caught up and out of himself in a sheet of flame；it comes to the soldier，war-mad on a stricken field and refusing quarter；and it came to Buck，leading the pack，sounding the old wolf cry，straining after the food that was alive and that fled swiftly before him through the moonlight.He was sounding the deeps of his nature，and of the parts of his nature that were deeper than he，going back into the womb of Time.He was mastered by the sheer surging of life，the tidal wave of being，the perfect joy of each separate muscle，joint，and sinew in that it was everything that was not death，that it was aglow and rampant，expressing itself in movement，flying exultantly under the stars and over the face of dead matter that did not move.

But Spitz，cold and calculating even in his supreme moods，left the pack and cut across a narrow neck of land where the creek made a long bend around.Buck did not know of this，and as he rounded the bend，the frost wraith of a rabbit still flitting before him，he saw another and larger frost wraith leap from the overhanging bank into the immediate path of the rabbit.It was Spitz.The rabbit could not turn，and as the white teeth broke its back in mid air it shrieked as loudly as a stricken man may shriek.At sound of this，the cry of Life plunging down from Life's apex in the grip of Death，the full pack at Buck's heels raised a hell's chorus of delight.

Buck did not cry out.He did not check himself，but drove in upon Spitz，shoulder to shoulder，so hard that he missed the throat.They rolled over and over in the powdery snow.Spitz gained his feet almost as though he had not been overthrown，slashing Buck down the shoulder and leaping clear.Twice his teeth clipped together，like the steel jaws of a trap，as he backed away for better footing，with lean and lifting lips that writhed and snarled.

In a flash Buck knew it.The time had come.It was to the death.As they circled about，snarling，ears laid back，keenly watchful for the advantage，the scene came to Buck with a sense of familiarity.He seemed to remember it all—the white woods，and earth，and moonlight，and the thrill of battle.Over the whiteness and silence brooded a ghostly calm.There was not the faintest whisper of air—nothing moved，not a leaf quivered，the visible breaths of the dogs rising slowly and lingering in the frosty air.They had made short work of the snowshoe rabbit，these dogs that were ill-tamed wolves；and they were now drawn up in an expectant circle.They，too，were silent，their eyes only gleaming and their breaths drifting slowly upward.To Buck it was nothing new or strange，this scene of old time.It was as though it had always been，the wonted way of things.

Spitz was a practised fighter.From Spitzbergen through the Arctic，and across Canada and the Barrens，he had held his own with all manner of dogs and achieved to mastery over them.Bitter rage was his，but never blind rage.In passion to rend and destroy，he never forgot that his enemy was in like passion to rend and destroy.He never rushed till he was prepared to receive a rush；never attacked till he had first defended that attack.

In vain Buck strove to sink his teeth in the neck of the big white dog.Wherever his fangs struck for the softer flesh，they were countered by the fangs of Spitz.Fang clashed fang，and lips were cut and bleeding，but Buck could not penetrate his enemy's guard.Then he warmed up and enveloped Spitz in a whirlwind of rushes.Time and time again he tried for the snow-white throat，where life bubbled near to the surface，and each time and every time Spitz slashed him and got away.Then Buck took to rushing，as though for the throat，when，suddenly drawing back his head and curving in from the side，he would drive his shoulder at the shoulder of Spitz，as a ram by which to overthrow him.But instead，Buck's shoulder was slashed down each time as Spitz leaped lightly away.

Spitz was untouched，while Buck was streaming with blood and panting hard.The fight was growing desperate.And all the while the silent and wolfish circle waited to finish off whichever dog went down.As Buck grew winded，Spitz took to rushing，and he kept him staggering for footing.Once Buck went over，and the whole circle of sixty dogs started up；but he recovered himself，almost in mid air，and the circle sank down again and waited.

But Buck possessed a quality that made for greatness—imagination.He fought by instinct，but he could fight by head as well.He rushed，as though attempting the old shoulder trick，but at the last instant swept low to the snow and in.His teeth closed on Spitz's left fore leg.There was a crunch of breaking bone，and the white dog faced him on three legs.Thrice he tried to knock him over，then repeated the trick and broke the right fore leg.Despite the pain and helplessness，Spitz struggled madly to keep up.He saw the silent circle，with gleaming eyes，lolling tongues，and silvery breaths drifting upward，closing in upon him as he had seen similar circles close in upon beaten antagonists in the past.Only this time he was the one who was beaten.

There was no hope for him.Buck was inexorable.Mercy was a thing reserved for gentler climes.He manoeuvred for the final rush.The circle had tightened till he could feel the breaths of the huskies on his flanks.He could see them，beyond Spitz and to either side，half crouching for the spring，their eyes fixed upon him.A pause seemed to fall.Every animal was motionless as though turned to stone.Only Spitz quivered and bristled as he staggered back and forth，snarling with horrible menace，as though to frighten off impending death.Then Buck sprang in and out；but while he was in，shoulder had at last squarely met shoulder.The dark circle became a dot on the moon-flooded snow as Spitz disappeared from view.Buck stood and looked on，the successful champion，the dominant primordial beast who had made his kill and found it good.





Chapter IV Who Has Won to Mastership


“Eh？Wot I say？I spik true w'en I say dat Buck two devils.”

This was Francois' speech next morning when he discovered Spitz missing and Buck covered with wounds.He drew him to the fire and by its light pointed them out.

“Dat Spitz fight lak hell，”said Perrault，as he surveyed the gaping rips and cuts.

“An' dat Buck fight lak two hells，”was Francois's answer.“An' now we make good time.No more Spitz，no more trouble，sure.”

While Perrault packed the camp outfit and loaded the sled，the dog driver proceeded to harness the dogs.Buck trotted up to the place Spitz would have occupied as leader；but Francois，not noticing him，brought Sol leks to the coveted position.In his judgment，Sol-leks was the best lead dog left.Buck sprang upon Sol-leks in a fury，driving him back and standing in his place.

“Eh？eh？”Francois cried，slapping his thighs gleefully.“Look at dat Buck.Heem keel dat Spitz，heem t'ink to take de job.”

“Go 'way，Chook！”he cried，but Buck refused to budge.

He took Buck by the scruff of the neck，and though the dog growled threateningly，dragged him to one side and replaced Sol-leks.The old dog did not like it，and showed plainly that he was afraid of Buck.Francois was obdurate，but when he turned his back Buck again displaced Sol-leks，who was not at all unwilling to go.

Francois was angry.“Now，by Gar，I feex you！”he cried，coming back with a heavy club in his hand.

Buck remembered the man in the red sweater，and retreated slowly；nor did he attempt to charge in when Sol-leks was once more brought forward.But he circled just beyond the range of the club，snarling with bitterness and rage；and while he circled he watched the club so as to dodge it if thrown by Francois，for he was become wise in the way of clubs.The driver went about his work，and he called to Buck when he was ready to put him in his old place in front of Dave.Buck retreated two or three steps.Francois followed him up，whereupon he again retreated.After some time of this，Francois threw down the club，thinking that Buck feared a thrashing.But Buck was in open revolt.He wanted，not to escape a clubbing，but to have the leadership.It was his by right.He had earned it，and he would not be content with less.

Perrault took a hand.Between them they ran him about for the better part of an hour.They threw clubs at him.He dodged.They cursed him，and his fathers and mothers before him，and all his seed to come after him down to the remotest generation，and every hair on his body and drop of blood in his veins；and he answered curse with snarl and kept out of their reach.He did not try to run away，but retreated around and around the camp，advertising plainly that when his desire was met，he would come in and be good.

Francois sat down and scratched his head.Perrault looked at his watch and swore.Time was flying，and they should have been on the trail an hour gone.Francois scratched his head again.He shook it and grinned sheepishly at the courier，who shrugged his shoulders in sign that they were beaten.Then Francois went up to where Sol-leks stood and called to Buck.Buck laughed，as dogs laugh，yet kept his distance.Francois unfastened Sol-leks's traces and put him back in his old place.The team stood harnessed to the sled in an unbroken line，ready for the trail.There was no place for Buck save at the front.Once more Francois called，and once more Buck laughed and kept away.

“T'row down de club，”Perrault commanded.

Francois complied，whereupon Buck trotted in，laughing triumphantly，and swung around into position at the head of the team.His traces were fastened，the sled broken out，and with both men running they dashed out on to the river trail.

Highly as the dog driver had forevalued Buck，with his two devils，he found，while the day was yet young，that he had undervalued.At a bound Buck took up the duties of leadership；and where judgment was required，and quick thinking and quick acting，he showed himself the superior even of Spitz，of whom Francois had never seen an equal.

But it was in giving the law and making his mates live up to it，that Buck excelled.Dave and Sol-leks did not mind the change in leadership.It was none of their business.Their business was to toil，and toil mightily，in the traces.So long as that were not interfered with，they did not care what happened.Billee，the good-natured，could lead for all they cared，so long as he kept order.The rest of the team，however，had grown unruly during the last days of Spitz，and their surprise was great now that Buck proceeded to lick them into shape.

Pike，who pulled at Buck's heels，and who never put an ounce more of his weight against the breastband than he was compelled to do，was swiftly and repeatedly shaken for loafing；and ere the first day was done he was pulling more than ever before in his life.The first night in camp，Joe，the sour one，was punished roundly—a thing that Spitz had never succeeded in doing.Buck simply smothered him by virtue of superior weight，and cut him up till he ceased snapping and began to whine for mercy.

The general tone of the team picked up immediately.It recovered its old-time solidarity，and once more the dogs leaped as one dog in the traces.At the Rink Rapids two native huskies，Teek and Koona，were added；and the celerity with which Buck broke them in took away Francois's breath.

“Nevaire such a dog as dat Buck！”he cried.“No，nevaire！Heem worth one t'ousan' dollair，by Gar！Eh？Wot you say，Perrault？”

And Perrault nodded.He was ahead of the record then，and gaining day by day.The trail was in excellent condition，well packed and hard，and there was no new fallen snow with which to contend.It was not too cold.The temperature dropped to fifty below zero and remained there the whole trip.The men rode and ran by turn，and the dogs were kept on the jump，with but infrequent stoppages.

The Thirty Mile River was comparatively coated with ice，and they covered in one day going out what had taken them ten days coming in.In one run they made a sixty-mile dash from the foot of Lake Le Barge to the White Horse Rapids.Across Marsh，Tagish，and Bennett（seventy miles of lakes），they flew so fast that the man whose turn it was to run towed behind the sled at the end of a rope.And on the last night of the second week they topped White Pass and dropped down the sea slope with the lights of Skaguay and of the shipping at their feet.

It was a record run.Each day for fourteen days they had averaged forty miles.For three days Perrault and Francois threw chests up and down the main street of Skaguay and were deluged with invitations to drink，while the team was the constant centre of a worshipful crowd of dog-busters and mushers.Then three or four western bad men aspired to clean out the town，were riddled like pepper boxes for their pains，and public interest turned to other idols.Next came official orders.Francois called Buck to him，threw his arms around him，wept over him.And that was the last of Francois and Perrault.Like other men，they passed out of Buck's life for good.

A Scotch half-breed took charge of him and his mates，and in company with a dozen other dog-teams he started back over the weary trail to Dawson.It was no light running now，nor record time，but heavy toil each day，with a heavy load behind；for this was the mail train，carrying word from the world to the men who sought gold under the shadow of the Pole.

Buck did not like it，but he bore up well to the work，taking pride in it after the manner of Dave and Sol-leks，and seeing that his mates，whether they prided in it or not，did their fair share.It was a monotonous life，operating with machine-like regularity.One day was very like another.At a certain time each morning the cooks turned out，fires were built，and breakfast was eaten.Then，while some broke camp，others harnessed the dogs，and they were under way an hour or so before the darkness fell which gave warning of dawn.At night，camp was made.Some pitched the flies，others cut firewood and pine boughs for the beds，and still others carried water or ice for the cooks.Also，the dogs were fed.To them，this was the one feature of the day，though it was good to loaf around，after the fish was eaten，for an hour or so with the other dogs，of which there were fivescore and odd.There were fierce fighters among them，but three battles with the fiercest brought Buck to mastery，so that when he bristled and showed his teeth they got out of his way.

Best of all，perhaps，he loved to lie near the fire，hind legs crouched under him，fore legs stretched out in front，head raised，and eyes blinking dreamily at the flames.Sometimes he thought of Judge Miller's big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley，and of the cement swimming tank，and Ysabel，the Mexican hairless，and Toots，the Japanese pug；but oftener he remembered the man in the red sweater，the death of Curly，the great fight with Spitz，and the good things he had eaten or would like to eat.He was not homesick.The Sunland was very dim and distant，and such memories had no power over him.Far more potent were the memories of his heredity that gave things he had never seen before a seeming familiarity；the instincts（which were but the memories of his ancestors become habits）which had lapsed in later days，and still later，in him，quickened and become alive again.

Sometimes as he crouched there，blinking dreamily at the flames，it seemed that the flames were of another fire，and that as he crouched by this other fire he saw another and different man from the half-breed cook before him.This other man was shorter of leg and longer of arm，with muscles that were stringy and knotty rather than rounded and swelling.The hair of this man was long and matted，and his head slanted back under it from the eyes.He uttered strange sounds，and seemed very much afraid of the darkness，into which he peered continually，clutching in his hand，which hung midway between knee and foot，a stick with a heavy stone made fast to the end.He was all but naked，a ragged and fire-scorched skin hanging part way down his back，but on his body there was much hair.In some places，across the chest and shoulders and down the outside of the arms and thighs，it was matted into almost a thick fur.He did not stand erect，but with trunk inclined forward from the hips，on legs that bent at the knees.About his body there was a peculiar springiness，or resiliency，almost catlike，and a quick alertness as of one who lived in perpetual fear of things seen and unseen.

At other times this hairy man squatted by the fire with head between his legs and slept.On such occasions his elbows were on his knees，his hands clasped above his head as though to shed rain by the hairy arms.And beyond that fire，in the circling darkness，Buck could see many gleaming coals，two by two，always two by two，which he knew to be the eyes of great beasts of prey.And he could hear the crashing of their bodies through the undergrowth，and the noises they made in the night.And dreaming there by the Yukon bank，with lazy eyes blinking at the fire，these sounds and sights of another world would make the hair to rise along his back and stand on end across his shoulders and up his neck，till he whimpered low and suppressedly，or growled softly，and the half-breed cook shouted at him，“Hey，you Buck，wake up！”Whereupon the other world would vanish and the real world come into his eyes，and he would get up and yawn and stretch as though he had been asleep.

It was a hard trip，with the mail behind them，and the heavy work wore them down.They were short of weight and in poor condition when they made Dawson，and should have had a ten days' or a week's rest at least.But in two days' time they dropped down the Yukon bank from the Barracks，loaded with letters for the outside.The dogs were tired，the drivers grumbling，and to make matters worse，it snowed every day.This meant a soft trail，greater friction on the runners，and heavier pulling for the dogs；yet the drivers were fair through it all，and did their best for the animals.

Each night the dogs were attended to first.They ate before the drivers ate，and no man sought his sleeping-robe till he had seen to the feet of the dogs he drove.Still，their strength went down.Since the beginning of the winter they had travelled eighteen hundred miles，dragging sleds the whole weary distance；and eighteen hundred miles will tell upon life of the toughest.Buck stood it，keeping his mates up to their work and maintaining discipline，though he，too，was very tired.Billee cried and whimpered regularly in his sleep each night.Joe was sourer than ever，and Sol-leks was unapproachable，blind side or other side.

But it was Dave who suffered most of all.Something had gone wrong with him.He became more morose and irritable，and when camp was pitched at once made his nest，where his driver fed him.Once out of the harness and down，he did not get on his feet again till harness-up time in the morning.Sometimes，in the traces，when jerked by a sudden stoppage of the sled，or by straining to start it，he would cry out with pain.The driver examined him，but could find nothing.All the drivers became interested in his case.They talked it over at mealtime，and over their last pipes before going to bed，and one night they held a consultation.He was brought from his nest to the fire and was pressed and prodded till he cried out many times.Something was wrong inside，but they could locate no broken bones，could not make it out.

By the time Cassiar Bar was reached，he was so weak that he was falling repeatedly in the traces.The Scotch half-breed called a halt and took him out of the team，making the next dog，Sol-leks，fast to the sled.His intention was to rest Dave，letting him run free behind the sled.Sick as he was，Dave resented being taken out，grunting and growling while the traces were unfastened，and whimpering brokenheartedly when he saw Sol-leks in the position he had held and served so long.For the pride of trace and trail was his，and，sick unto death，he could not bear that another dog should do his work.

When the sled started，he floundered in the soft snow alongside the beaten trail，attacking Sol-leks with his teeth，rushing against him and trying to thrust him off into the soft snow on the other side，striving to leap inside his traces and get between him and the sled，and all the while whining and yelping and crying with grief and pain.The half-breed tried to drive him away with the whip；but he paid no heed to the stinging lash，and the man had not the heart to strike harder.Dave refused to run quietly on the trail behind the sled，where the going was easy，but continued to flounder alongside in the soft snow，where the going was most difficult，till exhausted.Then he fell，and lay where he fell，howling lugubriously as the long train of sleds churned by.

With the last remnant of his strength he managed to stagger along behind till the train made another stop，when he floundered past the sleds to his own，where he stood alongside Sol-leks.His driver lingered a moment to get a light for his pipe from the man behind.Then he returned and started his dogs.They swung out on the trail with remarkable lack of exertion，turned their heads uneasily，and stopped in surprise.The driver was surprised，too；the sled had not moved.He called his comrades to witness the sight.Dave had bitten through both of Sol-leks's traces，and was standing directly in front of the sled in his proper place.

He pleaded with his eyes to remain there.The driver was perplexed.His comrades talked of how a dog could break its heart through being denied the work that killed it，and recalled instances they had known，where dogs，too old for the toil，or injured，had died because they were cut out of the traces.Also，they held it a mercy，since Dave was to die anyway，that he should die in the traces，heart-easy and content.So he was harnessed in again，and proudly he pulled as of old，though more than once he cried out involuntarily from the bite of his inward hurt.Several times he fell down and was dragged in the traces，and once the sled ran upon him so that he limped thereafter in one of his hind legs.

But he held out till camp was reached，when his driver made a place for him by the fire.Morning found him too weak to travel.At harness-up time he tried to crawl to his driver.By convulsive efforts he got on his feet，staggered，and fell.Then he wormed his way forward slowly toward where the harnesses were being put on his mates.He would advance his fore legs and drag up his body with a sort of hitching movement，when he would advance his fore legs and hitch ahead again for a few more inches.His strength left him，and the last his mates saw of him he lay gasping in the snow and yearning toward them.But they could hear him mournfully howling till they passed out of sight behind a belt of river timber.

Here the train was halted.The Scotch half-breed slowly retraced his steps to the camp they had left.The men ceased talking.A revolver-shot rang out.The man came back hurriedly.The whips snapped，the bells tinkled merrily，the sleds churned along the trail；but Buck knew，and every dog knew，what had taken place behind the belt of river trees.





Chapter V The Toil of Trace and Trail


Thirty days from the time it left Dawson，the Salt Water Mail，with Buck and his mates at the fore，arrived at Skaguay.They were in a wretched state，worn out and worn down.Buck's one hundred and forty pounds had dwindled to one hundred and fifteen.The rest of his mates，though lighter dogs，had relatively lost more weight than he.Pike，the malingerer，who，in his lifetime of deceit，had often successfully feigned a hurt leg，was now limping in earnest.Sol-leks was limping，and Dub was suffering from a wrenched shoulder blade.

They were all terribly footsore.No spring or rebound was left in them.Their feet fell heavily on the trail，jarring their bodies and doubling the fatigue of a day's travel.There was nothing the matter with them except that they were dead tired.It was not the dead-tiredness that comes through brief and excessive effort，from which recovery is a matter of hours；but it was the dead-tiredness that comes through the slow and prolonged strength drainage of months of toil.There was no power of recuperation left，no reserve strength to call upon.It had been all used，the last least bit of it.Every muscle，every fibre，every cell，was tired，dead tired.And there was reason for it.In less than five months they had travelled twenty-five hundred miles，during the last eighteen hundred of which they had had but five days' rest.When they arrived at Skaguay they were apparently on their last legs.They could barely keep the traces taut，and on the down grades just managed to keep out of the way of the sled.

“Mush on，poor sore feets，”the driver encouraged them as they tottered down the main street of Skaguay.“Dis is de las'.Den we get one long res'.Eh？For sure.One bully long res'.”

The drivers confidently expected a long stopover.Themselves，they had covered twelve hundred miles with two days' rest，and in the nature of reason and common justice they deserved an interval of loafing.But so many were the men who had rushed into the Klondike，and so many were the sweethearts，wives，and kin that had not rushed in，that the congested mail was taking on Alpine proportions；also，there were official orders.Fresh batches of Hudson Bay dogs were to take the places of those worthless for the trail.The worthless ones were to be got rid of，and，since dogs count for little against dollars，they were to be sold.

Three days passed，by which time Buck and his mates found how really tired and weak they were.Then，on the morning of the fourth day，two men from the States came along and bought them，harness and all，for a song.The men addressed each other as Hal and Charles.Charles was a middle-aged，lightish-colored man，with weak and watery eyes and a mustache that twisted fiercely and vigorously up，giving the lie to the limply drooping lip it concealed.Hal was a youngster of nineteen or twenty，with a big Colt's revolver and a hunting knife strapped about him on a belt that fairly bristled with cartridges.This belt was the most salient thing about him.It advertised his callowness—a callowness sheer and unutterable.Both men were manifestly out of place，and why such as they should adventure the North is part of the mystery of things that passes understanding.

Buck heard the chaffering，saw the money pass between the man and the Government agent，and knew that the Scotch half-breed and the mail-train drivers were passing out of his life on the heels of Perrault and Francois and the others who had gone before.When driven with his mates to the new owners' camp，Buck saw a slipshod and slovenly affair，tent half stretched，dishes unwashed，everything in disorder；also，he saw a woman.Mercedes the men called her.She was Charles' wife and Hal's sister—a nice family party.

Buck watched them apprehensively as they proceeded to take down the tent and load the sled.There was a great deal of effort about their manner，but no businesslike method.The tent was rolled into an awkward bundle three times as large as it should have been.The tin dishes were packed away unwashed.Mercedes continually fluttered in the way of her men and kept up an unbroken chattering of remonstrance and advice.When they put a clothes-sack on the front of the sled，she suggested it should go on the back；and when they had put it on the back，and covered it over with a couple of other bundles，she discovered overlooked articles which could abide nowhere else but in that very sack，and they unloaded again.

Three men from a neighboring tent came out and looked on，grinning and winking at one another.

“You've got a right smart load as it is，”said one of them；“and it's not me should tell you your business，but I wouldn't tote that tent along if I was you.”

“Undreamed of！”cried Mercedes，throwing up her hands in dainty dismay.“However in the world could I manage without a tent？”

“It's springtime，and you won't get any more cold weather，”the man replied.

She shook her head decidedly，and Charles and Hal put the last odds and ends on top the mountainous load.

“Think it'll ride？”one of the men asked.

“Why shouldn't it？”Charles demanded rather shortly.

“Oh，that's all right，that's all right，”the man hastened meekly to say.“I was just a-wonderin'，that is all.It seemed a mite top heavy.”

Charles turned his back and drew the lashings down as well as he could，which was not in the least well.

“An' of course the dogs can hike along all day with that contraption behind them，”affirmed a second of the men.

“Certainly，”said Hal，with freezing politeness，taking hold of the gee pole with one hand and swinging his whip from the other.“Mush！”he shouted.“Mush on there！”

The dogs sprang against the breastbands，strained hard for a few moments，then relaxed.They were unable to move the sled.

“The lazy brutes，I'll show them，”he cried，preparing to lash out at them with the whip.

But Mercedes interfered，crying，“Oh，Hal，you mustn't，”as she caught hold of the whip and wrenched it from him.“The poor dears！Now you must promise you won't be harsh with them for the rest of the trip，or I won't go a step.”

“Precious lot you know about dogs，”her brother sneered；“and I wish you'd leave me alone.They're lazy，I tell you，and you've got to whip them to get anything out of them.That's their way.You ask anyone.Ask one of those men.”

Mercedes looked at them imploringly，untold repugnance at sight of pain written in her pretty face.

“They're weak as water，if you want to know，”came the reply from one of the men.“Plum tuckered out，that's what's the matter.They need a rest.”

“Rest be blanked，”said Hal，with his beardless lips；and Mercedes said，“Oh！”in pain and sorrow at the oath.

But she was a clannish creature，and rushed at once to the defence of her brother.“Never mind that man，”she said pointedly.“You're driving our dogs，and you do what you think best with them.”

Again Hal's whip fell upon the dogs.They threw themselves against the breastbands，dug their feet into the packed snow，got down low to it，and put forth all their strength.The sled held as though it were an anchor.After two efforts，they stood still，panting.The whip was whistling savagely，when once more Mercedes interfered.She dropped on her knees before Buck，with tears in her eyes，and put her arms around his neck.

“You poor，poor dears，”she cried sympathetically，“why don't you pull hard？—then you wouldn't be whipped.”Buck did not like her，but he was feeling too miserable to resist her，taking it as part of the day's miserable work.

One of the onlookers，who had been clenching his teeth to suppress hot speech，now spoke up：

“It's not that I care a whoop what becomes of you，but for the dogs' sakes I just want to tell you，you can help them a mighty lot by breaking out that sled.The runners are froze fast.Throw your weight against the gee pole，right and left，and break it out.”

A third time the attempt was made，but this time，following the advice，Hal broke out the runners which had been frozen to the snow.The overloaded and unwieldy sled forged ahead，Buck and his mates struggling frantically under the rain of blows.A hundred yards ahead the path turned and sloped steeply into the main street.It would have required an experienced man to keep the top-heavy sled upright，and Hal was not such a man.As they swung on the turn the sled went over，spilling half its load through the loose lashings.The dogs never stopped.The lightened sled bounded on its side behind them.They were angry because of the ill treatment they had received and the unjust load.Buck was raging.He broke into a run，the team following his lead.Hal cried “Whoa！whoa！”but they gave no heed.He tripped and was pulled off his feet.The capsized sled ground over him，and the dogs dashed on up the street，adding to the gayety of Skaguay as they scattered the remainder of the outfit along its chief thoroughfare.

Kindhearted citizens caught the dogs and gathered up the scattered belongings.Also，they gave advice.Half the load and twice the dogs，if they ever expected to reach Dawson，was what was said.Hal and his sister and brother-in-law listened unwillingly，pitched tent，and overhauled the outfit.Canned goods were turned out that made men laugh，for canned goods on the Long Trail is a thing to dream about.“Blankets for a hotel”quoth one of the men who laughed and helped.“Half as many is too much；get rid of them.Throw away that tent，and all those dishes—who's going to wash them，anyway？Good Lord，do you think you're travelling on a Pullman？”

And so it went，the inexorable elimination of the superfluous.Mercedes cried when her clothes-bags were dumped on the ground and article after article was thrown out.She cried in general，and she cried in particular over each discarded thing.She clasped hands about knees，rocking back and forth brokenheartedly.She averred she would not go an inch，not for a dozen Charleses.She appealed to everybody and to everything，finally wiping her eyes and proceeding to cast out even articles of apparel that were imperative necessaries.And in her zeal，when she had finished with her own，she attacked the belongings of her men and went through them like a tornado.

This accomplished，the outfit，though cut in half，was still a formidable bulk.Charles and Hal went out in the evening and bought six Outside dogs.These，added to the six of the original team，and Teek and Koona，the huskies obtained at the Rink Rapids on the record trip，brought the team up to fourteen.But the Outside dogs，though practically broken in since their landing，did not amount to much.Three were short-haired pointers，one was a Newfoundland，and the other two were mongrels of indeterminate breed.They did not seem to know anything，these newcomers.Buck and his comrades looked upon them with disgust，and though he speedily taught them their places and what not to do，he could not teach them what to do.They did not take kindly to trace and trail.With the exception of the two mongrels，they were bewildered and spirit-broken by the strange savage environment in which they found themselves and by the ill treatment they had received.The two mongrels were without spirit at all；bones were the only things breakable about them.

With the newcomers hopeless and forlorn，and the old team worn out by twenty-five hundred miles of continuous trail，the outlook was anything but bright.The two men，however，were quite cheerful.And they were proud，too.They were doing the thing in style，with fourteen dogs.They had seen other sleds depart over the Pass for Dawson，or come in from Dawson，but never had they seen a sled with so many as fourteen dogs.In the nature of Arctic travel there was a reason why fourteen dogs should not drag one sled，and that was that one sled could not carry the food for fourteen dogs.But Charles and Hal did not know this.They had worked the trip out with a pencil，so much to a dog，so many dogs，so many days，Q.E.D.Mercedes looked over their shoulders and nodded comprehensively，it was all so very simple.

Late next morning Buck led the long team up the street.There was nothing lively about it，no snap or go in him and his fellows.They were starting dead weary.Four times he had covered the distance between Salt Water and Dawson，and the knowledge that，jaded and tired，he was facing the same trail once more，made him bitter.His heart was not in the work，nor was the heart of any dog.The Outsides were timid and frightened，the Insides without confidence in their masters.

Buck felt vaguely that there was no depending upon these two men and the woman.They did not know how to do anything，and as the days went by it became apparent that they could not learn.They were slack in all things，without order or discipline.It took them half the night to pitch a slovenly camp，and half the morning to break that camp and get the sled loaded in fashion so slovenly that for the rest of the day they were occupied in stopping and rearranging the load.Some days they did not make ten miles.On other days they were unable to get started at all.And on no day did they succeed in making more than half the distance used by the men as a basis in their dog-food computation.

It was inevitable that they should go short on dog-food.But they hastened it by overfeeding，bringing the day nearer when underfeeding would commence.The Outside dogs，whose digestions had not been trained by chronic famine to make the most of little，had voracious appetites.And when，in addition to this，the worn-out huskies pulled weakly，Hal decided that the orthodox ration was too small.He doubled it.And to cap it all，when Mercedes，with tears in her pretty eyes and a quaver in her throat，could not cajole him into giving the dogs still more，she stole from the fish sacks and fed them slyly.But it was not food that Buck and the huskies needed，but rest.And though they were making poor time，the heavy load they dragged sapped their strength severely.

Then came the underfeeding.Hal awoke one day to the fact that his dog food was half gone and the distance only quarter covered；further，that for love or money no additional dog-food was to be obtained.So he cut down even the orthodox ration and tried to increase the day's travel.His sister and brother-in-law seconded him；but they were frustrated by their heavy outfit and their own incompetence.It was a simple matter to give the dogs less food；but it was impossible to make the dogs travel faster，while their own inability to get under way earlier in the morning prevented them from travelling longer hours.Not only did they not know how to work dogs，but they did not know how to work themselves.

The first to go was Dub.Poor blundering thief that he was，always getting caught and punished，he had none the less been a faithful worker.His wrenched shoulder blade，untreated and unrested，went from bad to worse，till finally Hal shot him with the big Colt's revolver.It is a saying of the country that an Outside dog starves to death on the ration of the husky，so the six Outside dogs under Buck could do no less than die on half the ration of the husky.The Newfoundland went first，followed by the three short-haired pointers，the two mongrels hanging more grittily on to life，but going in the end.

By this time all the amenities and gentlenesses of the Southland had fallen away from the three people.Shorn of its glamour and romance，Arctic travel became to them a reality too harsh for their manhood and womanhood.Mercedes ceased weeping over the dogs，being too occupied with weeping over herself and with quarrelling with her husband and brother.To quarrel was the one thing they were never too weary to do.Their irritability arose out of their misery，increased with it，doubled upon it，outdistanced it.The wonderful patience of the trail which comes to men who toil hard and suffer sore，and remain sweet of speech and kindly，did not come to these two men and the woman.They had no inkling of such a patience.They were stiff and in pain；their muscles ached，their bones ached，their very hearts ached；and because of this they became sharp of speech，and hard words were first on their lips in the morning and last at night.

Charles and Hal wrangled whenever Mercedes gave them a chance.It was the cherished belief of each that he did more than his share of the work，and neither forbore to speak this belief at every opportunity.Sometimes Mercedes sided with her husband，sometimes with her brother.The result was a beautiful and unending family quarrel.Starting from a dispute as to which should chop a few sticks for the fire（a dispute which concerned only Charles and Hal），presently would be lugged in the rest of the family，fathers，mothers，uncles，cousins，people thousands of miles away，and some of them dead.That Hal's views on art，or the sort of society plays his mother's brother wrote，should have anything to do with the chopping of a few sticks of firewood，passes comprehension；nevertheless the quarrel was as likely to tend in that direction as in the direction of Charles' political prejudices.And that Charles' sister's tale-bearing tongue should be relevant to the building of a Yukon fire，was apparent only to Mercedes，who disburdened herself of copious opinions upon that topic，and incidentally upon a few other traits unpleasantly peculiar to her husband's family.In the meantime the fire remained unbuilt，the camp half pitched，and the dogs unfed.

Mercedes nursed a special grievance—the grievance of sex.She was pretty and soft，and had been chivalrously treated all her days.But the present treatment by her husband and brother was everything save chivalrous.It was her custom to be helpless.They complained.Upon which impeachment of what to her was her most essential sex-prerogative，she made their lives unendurable.She no longer considered the dogs，and because she was sore and tired，she persisted in riding on the sled.She was pretty and soft，but she weighed one hundred and twenty pounds—a lusty last straw to the load dragged by the weak and starving animals.She rode for days，till they fell in the traces and the sled stood still.Charles and Hal begged her to get off and walk，pleaded with her，entreated，the while she wept and importuned Heaven with a recital of their brutality.

On one occasion they took her off the sled by main strength.They never did it again.She let her legs go limp like a spoiled child，and sat down on the trail.They went on their way，but she did not move.After they had travelled three miles they unloaded the sled，came back for her，and by main strength put her on the sled again.

In the excess of their own misery they were callous to the suffering of their animals.Hal's theory，which he practised on others，was that one must get hardened.He had started out preaching it to his sister and brother-in-law.Failing there，he hammered it into the dogs with a club.At the Five Fingers the dog-food gave out，and a toothless old squaw offered to trade them a few pounds of frozen horse hide for the Colt's revolver that kept the big hunting-knife company at Hal's hip.A poor substitute for food was this hide，just as it had been stripped from the starved horses of the cattlemen six months back.In its frozen state it was more like strips of galvanized iron，and when a dog wrestled it into his stomach it thawed into thin and innutritious leathery strings and into a mass of short hair，irritating and indigestible.

And through it all Buck staggered along at the head of the team as in a nightmare.He pulled when he could；when he could no longer pull，he fell down and remained down till blows from whip or club drove him to his feet again.All the stiffness and gloss had gone out of his beautiful furry coat.The hair hung down，limp and draggled，or matted with dried blood where Hal's club had bruised him.His muscles had wasted away to knotty strings，and the flesh pads had disappeared，so that each rib and every bone in his frame were outlined cleanly through the loose hide that was wrinkled in folds of emptiness.It was heartbreaking，only Buck's heart was unbreakable.The man in the red sweater had proved that.

As it was with Buck，so was it with his mates.They were perambulating skeletons.There were seven all together，including him.In their very great misery they had become insensible to the bite of the lash or the bruise of the club.The pain of the beating was dull and distant，just as the things their eyes saw and their ears heard seemed dull and distant.They were not half living，or quarter living.They were simply so many bags of bones in which sparks of life fluttered faintly.When a halt was made，they dropped down in the traces like dead dogs，and the spark dimmed and paled and seemed to go out.And when the club or whip fell upon them，the spark fluttered feebly up，and they tottered to their feet and staggered on.

There came a day when Billee，the good-natured，fell and could not rise.Hal had traded off his revolver，so he took the axe and knocked Billee on the head as he lay in the traces，then cut the carcass out of the harness and dragged it to one side.Buck saw，and his mates saw，and they knew that this thing was very close to them.On the next day Koona went，and but five of them remained：Joe，too far gone to be malignant；Pike，crippled and limping，only half conscious and not conscious enough longer to malinger；Sol-leks，the one-eyed，still faithful to the toil of trace and trail，and mournful in that he had so little strength with which to pull；Teek，who had not travelled so far that winter and who was now beaten more than the others because he was fresher；and Buck，still at the head of the team，but no longer enforcing discipline or striving to enforce it，blind with weakness half the time and keeping the trail by the loom of it and by the dim feel of his feet.

It was beautiful spring weather，but neither dogs nor humans were aware of it.Each day the sun rose earlier and set later.It was dawn by three in the morning，and twilight lingered till nine at night.The whole long day was a blaze of sunshine.The ghostly winter silence had given way to the great spring murmur of awakening life.This murmur arose from all the land，fraught with the joy of living.It came from the things that lived and moved again，things which had been as dead and which had not moved during the long months of frost.The sap was rising in the pines.The willows and aspens were bursting out in young buds.Shrubs and vines were putting on fresh garbs of green.Crickets sang in the nights，and in the days all manner of creeping，crawling things rustled forth into the sun.Partridges and woodpeckers were booming and knocking in the forest.Squirrels were chattering，birds singing，and overhead honked the wild fowl driving up from the south in cunning wedges that split the air.

From every hill slope came the trickle of running water，the music of unseen fountains.All things were thawing，bending，snapping.The Yukon was straining to break loose the ice that bound it down.It ate away from beneath；the sun ate from above.Air holes formed，fissures sprang and spread apart，while thin sections of ice fell through bodily into the river.And amid all this bursting，rending，throbbing of awakening life，under the blazing sun and through the soft-sighing breezes，like wayfarers to death，staggered the two men，the woman，and the huskies.

With the dogs falling，Mercedes weeping and riding，Hal swearing innocuously，and Charles's eyes wistfully watering，they staggered into John Thornton's camp at the mouth of White River.When they halted，the dogs dropped down as though they had all been struck dead.Mercedes dried her eyes and looked at John Thornton.Charles sat down on a log to rest.He sat down very slowly and painstakingly what of his great stiffness.Hal did the talking.John Thornton was whittling the last touches on an axe handle he had made from a stick of birch.He whittled and listened，gave monosyllabic replies，and，when it was asked，terse advice.He knew the breed，and he gave his advice in the certainty that it would not be followed.

“They told us up above that the bottom was dropping out of the trail and that the best thing for us to do was to lay over，”Hal said in response to Thornton's warning to take no more chances on the rotten ice.“They told us we couldn't make White River，and here we are.”This last with a sneering ring of triumph in it.

“And they told you true，”John Thornton answered.“The bottom's likely to drop out at any moment.Only fools，with the blind luck of fools，could have made it.I tell you straight，I wouldn't risk my carcass on that ice for all the gold in Alaska.”

“That's because you're not a fool，I suppose，”said Hal.“All the same，we'll go on to Dawson.”He uncoiled his whip.“Get up there，Buck！Hi！Get up there！Mush on！”

Thornton went on whittling.It was idle，he knew，to get between a fool and his folly；while two or three fools more or less would not alter the scheme of things.

But the team did not get up at the command.It had long since passed into the stage where blows were required to rouse it.The whip flashed out，here and there，on its merciless errands.John Thornton compressed his lips.Sol-leks was the first to crawl to his feet.Teek followed.Joe came next，yelping with pain.Pike made painful efforts.Twice he fell over，when half up，and on the third attempt managed to rise.Buck made no effort.He lay quietly where he had fallen.The lash bit into him again and again，but he neither whined nor struggled.Several times Thornton started，as though to speak，but changed his mind.A moisture came into his eyes，and，as the whipping continued，he arose and walked irresolutely up and down.

This was the first time Buck had failed，in itself a sufficient reason to drive Hal into a rage.He exchanged the whip for the customary club.Buck refused to move under the rain of heavier blows which now fell upon him.Like his mates，he was barely able to get up，but，unlike them，he had made up his mind not to get up.He had a vague feeling of impending doom.This had been strong upon him when he pulled in to the bank，and it had not departed from him.What of the thin and rotten ice he had felt under his feet all day，it seemed that he sensed disaster close at hand，out there ahead on the ice where his master was trying to drive him.He refused to stir.So greatly had he suffered，and so far gone was he，that the blows did not hurt much.And as they continued to fall upon him，the spark of life within flickered and went down.It was nearly out.He felt strangely numb.As though from a great distance，he was aware that he was being beaten.The last sensations of pain left him.He no longer felt anything，though very faintly he could hear the impact of the club upon his body.But it was no longer his body，it seemed so far away.

And then，suddenly，without warning，uttering a cry that was inarticulate and more like the cry of an animal，John Thornton sprang upon the man who wielded the club.Hal was hurled backward，as though struck by a falling tree.Mercedes screamed.Charles looked on wistfully，wiped his watery eyes，but did not get up because of his stiffness.

John Thornton stood over Buck，struggling to control himself，too convulsed with rage to speak.

“If you strike that dog again，I'll kill you，”he at last managed to say in a choking voice.

“It's my dog，”Hal replied，wiping the blood from his mouth as he came back.“Get out of my way，or I'll fix you.I'm going to Dawson.”

Thornton stood between him and Buck，and evinced no intention of getting out of the way.Hal drew his long hunting knife.Mercedes screamed，cried，laughed，and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria.Thornton rapped Hal's knuckles with the axe handle，knocking the knife to the ground.He rapped his knuckles again as he tried to pick it up.Then he stooped，picked it up himself，and with two strokes cut Buck's traces.

Hal had no fight left in him.Besides，his hands were full with his sister，or his arms，rather；while Buck was too near dead to be of further use in hauling the sled.A few minutes later they pulled out from the bank and down the river.Buck heard them go and raised his head to see，Pike was leading，Sol-leks was at the wheel，and between were Joe and Teek.They were limping and staggering.Mercedes was riding the loaded sled.Hal guided at the gee pole，and Charles stumbled along in the rear.

As Buck watched them，Thornton knelt beside him and with rough，kindly hands searched for broken bones.By the time his search had disclosed nothing more than many bruises and a state of terrible starvation，the sled was a quarter of a mile away.Dog and man watched it crawling along over the ice.Suddenly，they saw its back end drop down，as into a rut，and the gee pole，with Hal clinging to it，jerk into the air.Mercedes's scream came to their ears.They saw Charles turn and make one step to run back，and then a whole section of ice give way and dogs and humans disappear.A yawning hole was all that was to be seen.The bottom had dropped out of the trail.

John Thornton and Buck looked at each other.

“You poor devil，”said John Thornton，and Buck licked his hand.





Chapter VI For the Love of a Man


When John Thornton froze his feet in the previous December，his partners had made him comfortable and left him to get well，going on themselves up the river to get out a raft of saw logs for Dawson.He was still limping slightly at the time he rescued Buck，but with the continued warm weather even the slight limp left him.And here，lying by the river bank through the long spring days，watching the running water，listening lazily to the songs of birds and the hum of nature，Buck slowly won back his strength.

A rest comes very good after one has travelled three thousand miles，and it must be confessed that Buck waxed lazy as his wounds healed，his muscles swelled out，and the flesh came back to cover his bones.For that matter，they were all loafing—Buck，John Thornton，and Skeet and Nig—waiting for the raft to come that was to carry them down to Dawson.Skeet was a little Irish setter who early made friends with Buck，who，in a dying condition，was unable to resent her first advances.She had the doctor trait which some dogs possess；and as a mother cat washes her kittens，so she washed and cleansed Buck's wounds.Regularly，each morning after he had finished his breakfast，she performed her self-appointed task，till he came to look for her ministrations as much as he did for Thornton's.Nig，equally friendly，though less demonstrative，was a huge black dog，half bloodhound and half deerhound，with eyes that laughed and a boundless good nature.

To Buck's surprise these dogs manifested no jealousy toward him.They seemed to share the kindliness and largeness of John Thornton.As Buck grew stronger they enticed him into all sorts of ridiculous games，in which Thornton himself could not forbear to join；and in this fashion Buck romped through his convalescence and into a new existence.Love，genuine passionate love，was his for the first time.This he had never experienced at Judge Miller's down in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley.With the Judge's sons，hunting and tramping，it had been a working partnership；with the Judge's grandsons，a sort of pompous guardianship；and with the Judge himself，a stately and dignified friendship.But love that was feverish and burning，that was adoration，that was madness，it had taken John Thornton to arouse.

This man had saved his life，which was something；but，further，he was the ideal master.Other men saw to the welfare of their dogs from a sense of duty and business expediency；he saw to the welfare of his as if they were his own children，because he could not help it.And he saw further.He never forgot a kindly greeting or a cheering word，and to sit down for a long talk with them（“gas”he called it）was as much his delight as theirs.He had a way of taking Buck's head roughly between his hands，and resting his own head upon Buck's，of shaking him back and forth，the while calling him ill names that to Buck were love names.Buck knew no greater joy than that rough embrace and the sound of murmured oaths，and at each jerk back and forth it seemed that his heart would be shaken out of his body so great was its ecstasy.And when，released，he sprang to his feet，his mouth laughing，his eyes eloquent，his throat vibrant with unuttered sound，and in that fashion remained without movement，John Thornton would reverently exclaim，“God！you can all but speak！”

Buck had a trick of love expression that was akin to hurt.He would often seize Thornton's hand in his mouth and close so fiercely that the flesh bore the impress of his teeth for some time afterward.And as Buck understood the oaths to be love words，so the man understood this feigned bite for a caress.

For the most part，however，Buck's love was expressed in adoration.While he went wild with happiness when Thornton touched him or spoke to him，he did not seek these tokens.Unlike Skeet，who was wont to shove her nose under Thornton's hand and nudge and nudge till petted，or Nig，who would stalk up and rest his great head on Thornton's knee，Buck was content to adore at a distance.He would lie by the hour，eager，alert，at Thornton's feet，looking up into his face，dwelling upon it，studying it，following with keenest interest each fleeting expression，every movement or change of feature.Or，as chance might have it，he would lie farther away，to the side or rear，watching the outlines of the man and the occasional movements of his body.And often，such was the communion in which they lived，the strength of Buck's gaze would draw John Thornton's head around，and he would return the gaze，without speech，his heart shining out of his eyes as Buck's heart shone out.

For a long time after his rescue，Buck did not like Thornton to get out of his sight.From the moment he left the tent to when he entered it again，Buck would follow at his heels.His transient masters since he had come into the Northland had bred in him a fear that no master could be permanent.He was afraid that Thornton would pass out of his life as Perrault and Francois and the Scotch half-breed had passed out.Even in the night，in his dreams，he was haunted by this fear.At such times he would shake off sleep and creep through the chill to the flap of the tent，where he would stand and listen to the sound of his master's breathing.

But in spite of this great love he bore John Thornton，which seemed to bespeak the soft civilizing influence，the strain of the primitive，which the Northland had aroused in him，remained alive and active.Faithfulness and devotion，things born of fire and roof，were his；yet he retained his wildness and wiliness.He was a thing of the wild，come in from the wild to sit by John Thornton's fire，rather than a dog of the soft Southland stamped with the marks of generations of civilization.Because of his very great love，he could not steal from this man，but from any other man，in any other camp，he did not hesitate an instant；while the cunning with which he stole enabled him to escape detection.

His face and body were scored by the teeth of many dogs，and he fought as fiercely as ever and more shrewdly.Skeet and Nig were too good-natured for quarrelling—besides，they belonged to John Thornton；but the strange dog，no matter what the breed or valor，swiftly acknowledged Buck's supremacy or found himself struggling for life with a terrible antagonist.And Buck was merciless.He had learned well the law of club and fang，and he never forewent an advantage or drew back from a foe he had started on the way to Death.He had lessoned from Spitz，and from the chief fighting dogs of the police and mail，and knew there was no middle course.He must master or be mastered；while to show mercy was a weakness.Mercy did not exist in the primordial life.It was misunderstood for fear，and such misunderstandings made for death.Kill or be killed，eat or be eaten，was the law；and this mandate，down out of the depths of Time，he obeyed.

He was older than the days he had seen and the breaths he had drawn.He linked the past with the present，and the eternity behind him throbbed through him in a mighty rhythm to which he swayed as the tides and seasons swayed.He sat by John Thornton's fire，a broad-breasted dog，white-fanged and long-furred；but behind him were the shades of all manner of dogs，half wolves and wild wolves，urgent and prompting，tasting the savor of the meat he ate，thirsting for the water he drank，scenting the wind with him，listening with him and telling him the sounds made by the wild life in the forest，dictating his moods，directing his actions，lying down to sleep with him when he lay down，and dreaming with him and beyond him and becoming themselves the stuff of his dreams.

So peremptorily did these shades beckon him，that each day mankind and the claims of mankind slipped farther from him.Deep in the forest a call was sounding，and as often as he heard this call，mysteriously thrilling and luring，he felt compelled to turn his back upon the fire and the beaten earth around it，and to plunge into the forest，and on and on，he knew not where or why；nor did he wonder where or why，the call sounding imperiously，deep in the forest.But as often as he gained the soft unbroken earth and the green shade，the love for John Thornton drew him back to the fire again.

Thornton alone held him.The rest of mankind was as nothing.Chance travellers might praise or pet him；but he was cold under it all，and from a too demonstrative man he would get up and walk away.When Thornton's partners，Hans and Pete，arrived on the long-expected raft，Buck refused to notice them till he learned they were close to Thornton；after that he tolerated them in a passive sort of way，accepting favors from them as though he favored them by accepting.They were of the same large type as Thornton，living close to the earth，thinking simply and seeing clearly；and ere they swung the raft into the big eddy by the saw-mill at Dawson，they understood Buck and his ways，and did not insist upon an intimacy such as obtained with Skeet and Nig.

For Thornton，however，his love seemed to grow and grow.He，alone among men，could put a pack upon Buck's back in the summer travelling.Nothing was too great for Buck to do，when Thornton commanded.One day（they had grubstaked themselves from the proceeds of the raft and left Dawson for the head-waters of the Tanana）the men and dogs were sitting on the crest of a cliff which fell away，straight down，to naked bed-rock three hundred feet below.John Thornton was sitting near the edge，Buck at his shoulder.A thoughtless whim seized Thornton，and he drew the attention of Hans and Pete to the experiment he had in mind.“Jump，Buck！”he commanded，sweeping his arm out and over the chasm.The next instant he was grappling with Buck on the extreme edge，while Hans and Pete were dragging them back into safety.

“It's uncanny，”Pete said，after it was over and they had caught their speech.

Thornton shook his head.“No，it is splendid，and it is terrible，too.Do you know，it sometimes makes me afraid.”

“I'm not hankering to be the man that lays hands on you while he's around，”Pete announced conclusively，nodding his head toward Buck.

“Py Jingo！”was Hans' contribution.“Not mineself either.”

It was at Circle City，ere the year was out，that Pete's apprehensions were realized.“Black”Burton，a man evil-tempered and malicious，had been picking a quarrel with a tenderfoot at the bar，when Thornton stepped good-naturedly between.Buck，as was his custom，was lying in a corner，head on paws，watching his master's every action.Burton struck out，without warning，straight from the shoulder.Thornton was sent spinning，and saved himself from falling only by clutching the rail of the bar.

Those who were looking on heard what was neither bark nor yelp，but a something which is best described as a roar，and they saw Buck's body rise up in the air as he left the floor for Burton's throat.The man saved his life by instinctively throwing out his arm，but was hurled backward to the floor with Buck on top of him.Buck loosed his teeth from the flesh of the arm and drove in again for the throat.This time the man succeeded only in partly blocking，and his throat was torn open.Then the crowd was upon Buck，and he was driven off；but while a surgeon checked the bleeding，he prowled up and down，growling furiously，attempting to rush in，and being forced back by an array of hostile clubs.A “miners' meeting，”called on the spot，decided that the dog had sufficient provocation，and Buck was discharged.But his reputation was made，and from that day his name spread through every camp in Alaska.

Later on，in the fall of the year，he saved John Thornton's life in quite another fashion.The three partners were lining a long and narrow poling-boat down a bad stretch of rapids on the Forty Mile Creek.Hans and Pete moved along the bank，snubbing with a thin Manila rope from tree to tree，while Thornton remained in the boat，helping its descent by means of a pole，and shouting directions to the shore.Buck，on the bank，worried and anxious，kept abreast of the boat，his eyes never off his master.

At a particularly bad spot，where a ledge of barely submerged rocks jutted out into the river，Hans cast off the rope，and，while Thornton poled the boat out into the stream，ran down the bank with the end in his hand to snub the boat when it had cleared the ledge.This it did，and was flying down-stream in a current as swift as a millrace，when Hans checked it with the rope and checked too suddenly.The boat flirted over and snubbed in to the bank bottom up，while Thornton，flung sheer out of it，was carried down stream toward the worst part of the rapids，a stretch of wild water in which no swimmer could live.

Buck had sprung in on the instant；and at the end of three hundred yards，amid a mad swirl of water，he overhauled Thornton.When he felt him grasp his tail，Buck headed for the bank，swimming with all his splendid strength.But the progress shoreward was slow；the progress downstream amazingly rapid.From below came the fatal roaring where the wild current went wilder and was rent in shreds and spray by the rocks which thrust through like the teeth of an enormous comb.The suck of the water as it took the beginning of the last steep pitch was frightful，and Thornton knew that the shore was impossible.He scraped furiously over a rock，bruised across a second，and struck a third with crushing force.He clutched its slippery top with both hands，releasing Buck，and above the roar of the churning water shouted：“Go，Buck！Go！”

Buck could not hold his own，and swept on down-stream，struggling desperately，but unable to win back.When he heard Thornton's command repeated，he partly reared out of the water，throwing his head high，as though for a last look，then turned obediently toward the bank.He swam powerfully and was dragged ashore by Pete and Hans at the very point where swimming ceased to be possible and destruction began.

They knew that the time a man could cling to a slippery rock in the face of that driving current was a matter of minutes，and they ran as fast as they could up the bank to a point far above where Thornton was hanging on.They attached the line with which they had been snubbing the boat to Buck's neck and shoulders，being careful that it should neither strangle him nor impede his swimming，and launched him into the stream.He struck out boldly，but not straight enough into the stream.He discovered the mistake too late，when Thornton was abreast of him and a bare half-dozen strokes away while he was being carried helplessly past.

Hans promptly snubbed with the rope，as though Buck were a boat.The rope thus tightening on him in the sweep of the current，he was jerked under the surface，and under the surface he remained till his body struck against the bank and he was hauled out.He was half drowned，and Hans and Pete threw themselves upon him，pounding the breath into him and the water out of him.He staggered to his feet and fell down.The faint sound of Thornton's voice came to them，and though they could not make out the words of it，they knew that he was in his extremity.His master's voice acted on Buck like an electric shock.He sprang to his feet and ran up the bank ahead of the men to the point of his previous departure.

Again the rope was attached and he was launched，and again he struck out，but this time straight into the stream.He had miscalculated once，but he would not be guilty of it a second time.Hans paid out the rope，permitting no slack，while Pete kept it clear of coils.Buck held on till he was on a line straight above Thornton；then he turned，and with the speed of an express train headed down upon him.Thornton saw him coming，and，as Buck struck him like a battering ram，with the whole force of the current behind him，he reached up and closed with both arms around the shaggy neck.Hans snubbed the rope around the tree，and Buck and Thornton were jerked under the water.Strangling，suffocating，sometimes one uppermost and sometimes the other，dragging over the jagged bottom，smashing against rocks and snags，they veered in to the bank.

Thornton came to，belly downward and being violently propelled back and forth across a drift log by Hans and Pete.His first glance was for Buck，over whose limp and apparently lifeless body Nig was setting up a howl，while Skeet was licking the wet face and closed eyes.Thornton was himself bruised and battered，and he went carefully over Buck's body，when he had been brought around，finding three broken ribs.

“That settles it，”he announced.“We camp right here.”And camp they did，till Buck's ribs knitted and he was able to travel.

That winter，at Dawson，Buck performed another exploit，not so heroic，perhaps，but one that put his name many notches higher on the totem pole of Alaskan fame.This exploit was particularly gratifying to the three men；for they stood in need of the outfit which it furnished，and were enabled to make a long-desired trip into the virgin East，where miners had not yet appeared.It was brought about by a conversation in the Eldorado Saloon，in which men waxed boastful of their favorite dogs.Buck，because of his record，was the target for these men，and Thornton was driven stoutly to defend him.At the end of half an hour one man stated that his dog could start a sled with five hundred pounds and walk off with it；a second bragged six hundred for his dog；and a third，seven hundred.

“Pooh！pooh！”said John Thornton；“Buck can start a thousand pounds.”

“And break it out？and walk off with it for a hundred yards？”demanded Matthewson，a Bonanza King，he of the seven hundred vaunt.

“And break it out，and walk off with it for a hundred yards，”John Thornton said coolly.

“Well，”Matthewson said，slowly and deliberately，so that all could hear，“I've got a thousand dollars that says he can't.And there it is.”So saying，he slammed a sack of gold dust of the size of a bologna sausage down upon the bar.

Nobody spoke.Thornton's bluff，if bluff it was，had been called.He could feel a flush of warm blood creeping up his face.His tongue had tricked him.He did not know whether Buck could start a thousand pounds.Half a ton！The enormousness of it appalled him.He had great faith in Buck's strength and had often thought him capable of starting such a load；but never，as now，had he faced the possibility of it，the eyes of a dozen men fixed upon him，silent and waiting.Further，he had no thousand dollars；nor had Hans or Pete.

“I've got a sled standing outside now，with twenty fiftypound sacks of flour on it，”Matthewson went on with brutal directness；“so don't let that hinder you.”

Thornton did not reply.He did not know what to say.He glanced from face to face in the absent way of a man who has lost the power of thought and is seeking somewhere to find the thing that will start it going again.The face of Jim O'Brien，a Mastodon King and old-time comrade，caught his eyes.It was as a cue to him，seeming to rouse him to do what he would never have dreamed of doing.

“Can you lend me a thousand？”he asked，almost in a whisper.

“Sure，”answered O'Brien，thumping down a plethoric sack by the side of Matthewson's.“Though it's little faith I'm having，John，that the beast can do the trick.”

The Eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test.The tables were deserted，and the dealers and gamekeepers came forth to see the outcome of the wager and to lay odds.Several hundred men，furred and mittened，banked around the sled within easy distance.Matthewson's sled，loaded with a thousand pounds of flour，had been standing for a couple of hours，and in the intense cold（it was sixty below zero）the runners had frozen fast to the hard-packed snow.Men offered odds of two to one that Buck could not budge the sled.A quibble arose concerning the phrase “break out.”O'Brien contended it was Thornton's privilege to knock the runners loose，leaving Buck to “break it out”from a dead standstill.Matthewson insisted that the phrase included breaking the runners from the frozen grip of the snow.A majority of the men who had witnessed the making of the bet decided in his favor，whereat the odds went up to three to one against Buck.

There were no takers.Not a man believed him capable of the feat.Thornton had been hurried into the wager，heavy with doubt；and now that he looked at the sled itself，the concrete fact，with the regular team of ten dogs curled up in the snow before it，the more impossible the task appeared.Matthewson waxed jubilant.

“Three to one！”he proclaimed.“I'll lay you another thousand at that figure，Thornton.What d'ye say？”

Thornton's doubt was strong in his face，but his fighting spirit was aroused—the fighting spirit that soars above odds，fails to recognize the impossible，and is deaf to all save the clamor for battle.He called Hans and Pete to him.Their sacks were slim，and with his own the three partners could rake together only two hundred dollars.In the ebb of their fortunes，this sum was their total capital；yet they laid it unhesitatingly against Matthewson's six hundred.

The team of ten dogs was unhitched，and Buck，with his own harness，was put into the sled.He had caught the contagion of the excitement，and he felt that in some way he must do a great thing for John Thornton.Murmurs of admiration at his splendid appearance went up.He was in perfect condition，without an ounce of superfluous flesh，and the one hundred and fifty pounds that he weighed were so many pounds of grit and virility.His furry coat shone with the sheen of silk.Down the neck and across the shoulders，his mane，in repose as it was，half bristled and seemed to lift with every movement，as though excess of vigor made each particular hair alive and active.The great breast and heavy fore legs were no more than in proportion with the rest of the body，where the muscles showed in tight rolls underneath the skin.Men felt these muscles and proclaimed them hard as iron，and the odds went down to two to one.

“Gad，sir！Gad，sir！”stuttered a member of the latest dynasty，a king of the Skookum Benches.“I offer you eight hundred for him，sir，before the test，sir；eight hundred just as he stands.”

Thornton shook his head and stepped to Buck's side.

“You must stand off from him，”Matthewson protested.“Free play and plenty of room.”

The crowd fell silent；only could be heard the voices of the gamblers vainly offering two to one.Everybody acknowledged Buck a magnificent animal，but twenty fifty-pound sacks of flour bulked too large in their eyes for them to loosen their pouch-strings.

Thornton knelt down by Buck's side.He took his head in his two hands and rested cheek on cheek.He did not playfully shake him，as was his wont，or murmur soft love curses；but he whispered in his ear.“As you love me，Buck.As you love me，”was what he whispered.Buck whined with suppressed eagerness.

The crowd was watching curiously.The affair was growing mysterious.It seemed like a conjuration.As Thornton got to his feet，Buck seized his mittened hand between his jaws，pressing in with his teeth and releasing slowly，half-reluctantly.It was the answer，in terms，not of speech，but of love.Thornton stepped well back.

“Now，Buck，”he said.

Buck tightened the traces，then slacked them for a matter of several inches.It was the way he had learned.

“Gee！”Thornton's voice rang out，sharp in the tense silence.

Buck swung to the right，ending the movement in a plunge that took up the slack and with a sudden jerk arrested his one hundred and fifty pounds.The load quivered，and from under the runners arose a crisp crackling.

“Haw！”Thornton commanded.

Buck duplicated the manoeuvre，this time to the left.The crackling turned into a snapping，the sled pivoting and the runners slipping and grating several inches to the side.The sled was broken out.Men were holding their breaths，intensely unconscious of the fact.

“Now，MUSH！”

Thornton's command cracked out like a pistol-shot.Buck threw himself forward，tightening the traces with a jarring lunge.His whole body was gathered compactly together in the tremendous effort，the muscles writhing and knotting like live things under the silky fur.His great chest was low to the ground，his head forward and down，while his feet were flying like mad，the claws scarring the hard-packed snow in parallel grooves.The sled swayed and trembled，half-started forward.One of his feet slipped，and one man groaned aloud.Then the sled lurched ahead in what appeared a rapid succession of jerks，though it never really came to a dead stop again...half an inch...an inch...two inches...The jerks perceptibly diminished；as the sled gained momentum，he caught them up，till it was moving steadily along.

Men gasped and began to breathe again，unaware that for a moment they had ceased to breathe.Thornton was running behind，encouraging Buck with short，cheery words.The distance had been measured off，and as he neared the pile of firewood which marked the end of the hundred yards，a cheer began to grow and grow，which burst into a roar as he passed the firewood and halted at command.Every man was tearing himself loose，even Matthewson.Hats and mittens were flying in the air.Men were shaking hands，it did not matter with whom，and bubbling over in a general incoherent babel.

But Thornton fell on his knees beside Buck.Head was against head，and he was shaking him back and forth.Those who hurried up heard him cursing Buck，and he cursed him long and fervently，and softly and lovingly.

“Gad，sir！Gad，sir！”spluttered the Skookum Bench king.“I'll give you a thousand for him，sir，a thousand，sir—twelve hundred，sir.”

Thornton rose to his feet.His eyes were wet.The tears were streaming frankly down his cheeks.“Sir，”he said to the Skookum Bench king，“no，sir.You can go to hell，sir.It's the best I can do for you，sir.”

Buck seized Thornton's hand in his teeth.Thornton shook him back and forth.As though animated by a common impulse，the onlookers drew back to a respectful distance；nor were they again indiscreet enough to interrupt.





Chapter VII The Sounding of the Call


When Buck earned sixteen hundred dollars in five minutes for John Thornton，he made it possible for his master to pay off certain debts and to journey with his partners into the East after a fabled lost mine，the history of which was as old as the history of the country.Many men had sought it；few had found it；and more than a few there were who had never returned from the quest.This lost mine was steeped in tragedy and shrouded in mystery.No one knew of the first man.The oldest tradition stopped before it got back to him.From the beginning there had been an ancient and ramshackle cabin.Dying men had sworn to it，and to the mine the site of which it marked，clinching their testimony with nuggets that were unlike any known grade of gold in the Northland.

But no living man had looted this treasure house，and the dead were dead；wherefore John Thornton and Pete and Hans，with Buck and half a dozen other dogs，faced into the East on an unknown trail to achieve where men and dogs as good as themselves had failed.They sledded seventy miles up the Yukon，swung to the left into the Stewart River，passed the Mayo and the Mc Question，and held on until the Stewart itself became a streamlet，threading the upstanding peaks which marked the backbone of the continent.

John Thornton asked little of man or nature.He was unafraid of the wild.With a handful of salt and a rifle he could plunge into the wilderness and fare wherever he pleased and as long as he pleased.Being in no haste，Indian fashion，he hunted his dinner in the course of the day's travel；and if he failed to find it，like the Indian，he kept on travelling，secure in the knowledge that sooner or later he would come to it.So，on this great journey into the East，straight meat was the bill of fare，ammunition and tools principally made up the load on the sled，and the time card was drawn upon the limitless future.

To Buck it was boundless delight，this hunting，fishing，and indefinite wandering through strange places.For weeks at a time they would hold on steadily，day after day；and for weeks upon end they would camp，here and there，the dogs loafing and the men burning holes through frozen muck and gravel and washing countless pans of dirt by the heat of the fire.Sometimes they went hungry，sometimes they feasted riotously，all according to the abundance of game and the fortune of hunting.Summer arrived，and dogs and men packed on their backs，rafted across blue mountain lakes，and descended or ascended unknown rivers in slender boats whipsawed from the standing forest.

The months came and went，and back and forth they twisted through the uncharted vastness，where no men were and yet where men had been if the Lost Cabin were true.They went across divides in summer blizzards，shivered under the midnight sun on naked mountains between the timber line and the eternal snows，dropped into summer valleys amid swarming gnats and flies，and in the shadows of glaciers picked strawberries and flowers as ripe and fair as any the Southland could boast.In the fall of the year they penetrated a weird lake country，sad and silent，where wildfowl had been，but where then there was no life nor sign of life—only the blowing of chill winds，the forming of ice in sheltered places，and the melancholy rippling of waves on lonely beaches.

And through another winter they wandered on the obliterated trails of men who had gone before.Once，they came upon a path blazed through the forest，an ancient path，and the Lost Cabin seemed very near.But the path began nowhere and ended nowhere，and it remained mystery，as the man who made it and the reason he made it remained mystery.Another time they chanced upon the time-graven wreckage of a hunting lodge，and amid the shreds of rotted blankets John Thornton found a long-barrelled flintlock.He knew it for a Hudson Bay Company gun of the young days in the Northwest，when such a gun was worth its height in beaver skins packed flat，And that was all—no hint as to the man who in an early day had reared the lodge and left the gun among the blankets.

Spring came on once more，and at the end of all their wandering they found，not the Lost Cabin，but a shallow placer in a broad valley where the gold showed like yellow butter across the bottom of the washing pan.They sought no farther.Each day they worked earned them thousands of dollars in clean dust and nuggets，and they worked every day.The gold was sacked in moose-hide bags，fifty pounds to the bag，and piled like so much firewood outside the spruce-bough lodge.Like giants they toiled，days flashing on the heels of days like dreams as they heaped the treasure up.

There was nothing for the dogs to do，save the hauling in of meat now and again that Thornton killed，and Buck spent long hours musing by the fire.The vision of the short-legged hairy man came to him more frequently，now that there was little work to be done；and often，blinking by the fire，Buck wandered with him in that other world which he remembered.

The salient thing of this other world seemed fear.When he watched the hairy man sleeping by the fire，head between his knees and hands clasped above，Buck saw that he slept restlessly，with many starts and awakenings，at which times he would peer fearfully into the darkness and fling more wood upon the fire.Did they walk by the beach of a sea，where the hairy man gathered shellfish and ate them as he gathered，it was with eyes that roved everywhere for hidden danger and with legs prepared to run like the wind at its first appearance.Through the forest they crept noiselessly，Buck at the hairy man's heels；and they were alert and vigilant，the pair of them，ears twitching and moving and nostrils quivering，for the man heard and smelled as keenly as Buck.The hairy man could spring up into the trees and travel ahead as fast as on the ground，swinging by the arms from limb to limb，sometimes a dozen feet apart，letting go and catching，never falling，never missing his grip.In fact，he seemed as much at home among the trees as on the ground；and Buck had memories of nights of vigil spent beneath trees wherein the hairy man roosted，holding on tightly as he slept.

And closely akin to the visions of the hairy man was the call still sounding in the depths of the forest.It filled him with a great unrest and strange desires.It caused him to feel a vague，sweet gladness，and he was aware of wild yearnings and stirrings for he knew not what.Sometimes he pursued the call into the forest，looking for it as though it were a tangible thing，barking softly or defiantly，as the mood might dictate.He would thrust his nose into the cool wood moss，or into the black soil where long grasses grew，and snort with joy at the fat earth smells；or he would crouch for hours，as if in concealment，behind fungus-covered trunks of fallen trees，wide-eyed and wide-eared to all that moved and sounded about him.It might be，lying thus，that he hoped to surprise this call he could not understand.But he did not know why he did these various things.He was impelled to do them，and did not reason about them at all.

Irresistible impulses seized him.He would be lying in camp，dozing lazily in the heat of the day，when suddenly his head would lift and his ears cock up，intent and listening，and he would spring to his feet and dash away，and on and on，for hours，through the forest aisles and across the open spaces where the niggerheads bunched.He loved to run down dry watercourses，and to creep and spy upon the bird life in the woods.For a day at a time he would lie in the underbrush where he could watch the partridges drumming and strutting up and down.But especially he loved to run in the dim twilight of the summer midnights，listening to the subdued and sleepy murmurs of the forest，reading signs and sounds as man may read a book，and seeking for the mysterious something that called—called，waking or sleeping，at all times，for him to come.

One night he sprang from sleep with a start，eager-eyed，nostrils quivering and scenting，his mane bristling in recurrent waves.From the forest came the call（or one note of it，for the call was many noted），distinct and definite as never before—a long-drawn howl，like，yet unlike，any noise made by husky dog.And he knew it，in the old familiar way，as a sound heard before.He sprang through the sleeping camp and in swift silence dashed through the woods.As he drew closer to the cry he went more slowly，with caution in every movement，till he came to an open place among the trees，and looking out saw，erect on haunches，with nose pointed to the sky，a long，lean，timber wolf.

He had made no noise，yet it ceased from its howling and tried to sense his presence.Buck stalked into the open，half-crouching，body gathered compactly together，tail straight and stiff，feet falling with unwonted care.Every movement advertised commingled threatening and overture of friendliness.It was the menacing truce that marks the meeting of wild beasts that prey.But the wolf fled at sight of him.He followed，with wild leapings，in a frenzy to overtake.He ran him into a blind channel，in the bed of the creek where a timber jam barred the way.The wolf whirled about，pivoting on his hind legs after the fashion of Joe and of all cornered husky dogs，snarling and bristling，clipping his teeth together in a continuous and rapid succession of snaps.

Buck did not attack，but circled him about and hedged him in with friendly advances.The wolf was suspicious and afraid；for Buck made three of him in weight，while his head barely reached Buck's shoulder.Watching his chance，he darted away，and the chase was resumed.Time and again he was cornered，and the thing repeated，though he was in poor condition，or Buck could not so easily have overtaken him.He would run till Buck's head was even with his flank，when he would whirl around at bay，only to dash away again at the first opportunity.

But in the end Buck's pertinacity was rewarded；for the wolf，finding that no harm was intended，finally sniffed noses with him.Then they became friendly，and played about in the nervous，half-coy way with which fierce beasts belie their fierceness.After some time of this the wolf started off at an easy lope in a manner that plainly showed he was going somewhere.He made it clear to Buck that he was to come，and they ran side by side through the sombre twilight，straight up the creek bed，into the gorge from which it issued，and across the bleak divide where it took its rise.

On the opposite slope of the watershed they came down into a level country where were great stretches of forest and many streams，and through these great stretches they ran steadily，hour after hour，the sun rising higher and the day growing warmer.Buck was wildly glad.He knew he was at last answering the call，running by the side of his wood brother toward the place from where the call surely came.Old memories were coming upon him fast，and he was stirring to them as of old he stirred to the realities of which they were the shadows.He had done this thing before，somewhere in that other and dimly remembered world，and he was doing it again，now，running free in the open，the unpacked earth underfoot，the wide sky overhead.

They stopped by a running stream to drink，and，stopping，Buck remembered John Thornton.He sat down.The wolf started on toward the place from where the call surely came，then returned to him，sniffing noses and making actions as though to encourage him.But Buck turned about and started slowly on the back track.For the better part of an hour the wild brother ran by his side，whining softly.Then he sat down，pointed his nose upward，and howled.It was a mournful howl，and as Buck held steadily on his way he heard it grow fainter and fainter until it was lost in the distance.

John Thornton was eating dinner when Buck dashed into camp and sprang upon him in a frenzy of affection，overturning him，scrambling upon him，licking his face，biting his hand—“playing the general tomfool，”as John Thornton characterized it，the while he shook Buck back and forth and cursed him lovingly.

For two days and nights Buck never left camp，never let Thornton out of his sight.He followed him about at his work，watched him while he ate，saw him into his blankets at night and out of them in the morning.But after two days the call in the forest began to sound more imperiously than ever.Buck's restlessness came back on him，and he was haunted by recollections of the wild brother，and of the smiling land beyond the divide and the run side by side through the wide forest stretches.Once again he took to wandering in the woods，but the wild brother came no more；and though he listened through long vigils，the mournful howl was never raised.

He began to sleep out at night，staying away from camp for days at a time；and once he crossed the divide at the head of the creek and went down into the land of timber and streams.There he wandered for a week，seeking vainly for fresh sign of the wild brother，killing his meat as he travelled and travelling with the long，easy lope that seems never to tire.He fished for salmon in a broad stream that emptied somewhere into the sea，and by this stream he killed a large black bear，blinded by the mosquitoes while likewise fishing，and raging through the forest helpless and terrible.Even so，it was a hard fight，and it aroused the last latent remnants of Buck's ferocity.And two days later，when he returned to his kill and found a dozen wolverines quarrelling over the spoil，he scattered them like chaff；and those that fled left two behind who would quarrel no more.

The blood longing became stronger than ever before.He was a killer，a thing that preyed，living on the things that lived，unaided，alone，by virtue of his own strength and prowess，surviving triumphantly in a hostile environment where only the strong survived.Because of all this he became possessed of a great pride in himself，which communicated itself like a contagion to his physical being.It advertised itself in all his movements，was apparent in the play of every muscle，spoke plainly as speech in the way he carried himself，and made his glorious furry coat if anything more glorious.But for the stray brown on his muzzle and above his eyes，and for the splash of white hair that ran midmost down his chest，he might well have been mistaken for a gigantic wolf，larger than the largest of the breed.From his St.Bernard father he had inherited size and weight，but it was his shepherd mother who had given shape to that size and weight.His muzzle was the long wolf muzzle，save that it was larger than the muzzle of any wolf；and his head，somewhat broader，was the wolf head on a massive scale.

His cunning was wolf cunning，and wild cunning；his intelligence，shepherd intelligence and St.Bernard intelligence；and all this，plus an experience gained in the fiercest of schools，made him as formidable a creature as any that roamed the wild.A carnivorous animal living on a straight meat diet，he was in full flower，at the high tide of his life，overspilling with vigor and virility.When Thornton passed a caressing hand along his back，a snapping and crackling followed the hand，each hair discharging its pent magnetism at the contact.Every part，brain and body，nerve tissue and fibre，was keyed to the most exquisite pitch；and between all the parts there was a perfect equilibrium or adjustment.To sights and sounds and events which required action，he responded with lightning-like rapidity.Quickly as a husky dog could leap to defend from attack or to attack，he could leap twice as quickly.He saw the movement，or heard sound，and responded in less time than another dog required to compass the mere seeing or hearing.He perceived and determined and responded in the same instant.In point of fact the three actions of perceiving，determining，and responding were sequential；but so infinitesimal were the intervals of time between them that they appeared simultaneous.His muscles were surcharged with vitality，and snapped into play sharply，like steel springs.Life streamed through him in splendid flood，glad and rampant，until it seemed that it would burst him asunder in sheer ecstasy and pour forth generously over the world.

“Never was there such a dog，”said John Thornton one day，as the partners watched Buck marching out of camp.

“When he was made，the mould was broke，”said Pete.

“Py jingo！I t'ink so mineself，”Hans affirmed.

They saw him marching out of camp，but they did not see the instant and terrible transformation which took place as soon as he was within the secrecy of the forest.He no longer marched.At once he became a thing of the wild，stealing along softly，cat-footed，a passing shadow that appeared and disappeared among the shadows.He knew how to take advantage of every cover，to crawl on his belly like a snake，and like a snake to leap and strike.He could take a ptarmigan from its nest，kill a rabbit as it slept，and snap in mid air the little chipmunks fleeing a second too late for the trees.Fish，in open pools，were not too quick for him；nor were beaver，mending their dams，too wary.He killed to eat，not from wantonness；but he preferred to eat what he killed himself.So a lurking humor ran through his deeds，and it was his delight to steal upon the squirrels，and，when he all but had them，to let them go，chattering in mortal fear to the treetops.

As the fall of the year came on，the moose appeared in greater abundance，moving slowly down to meet the winter in the lower and less rigorous valleys.Buck had already dragged down a stray part-grown calf；but he wished strongly for larger and more formidable quarry，and he came upon it one day on the divide at the head of the creek.A band of twenty moose had crossed over from the land of streams and timber，and chief among them was a great bull.He was in a savage temper，and，standing over six feet from the ground，was as formidable an antagonist as even Buck could desire.Back and forth the bull tossed his great palmated antlers，branching to fourteen points and embracing seven feet within the tips.His small eyes burned with a vicious and bitter light，while he roared with fury at sight of Buck.

From the bull's side，just forward of the flank，protruded a feathered arrow end，which accounted for his savageness.Guided by that instinct which came from the old hunting days of the primordial world，Buck proceeded to cut the bull out from the herd.It was no slight task.He would bark and dance about in front of the bull，just out of reach of the great antlers and of the terrible splay hoofs which could have stamped his life out with a single blow.Unable to turn his back on the fanged danger and go on，the bull would be driven into paroxysms of rage.At such moments he charged Buck，who retreated craftily，luring him on by a simulated inability to escape.But when he was thus separated from his fellows，two or three of the younger bulls would charge back upon Buck and enable the wounded bull to rejoin the herd.

There is a patience of the wild—dogged，tireless，persistent as life itself—that holds motionless for endless hours the spider in its web，the snake in its coils，the panther in its ambuscade；this patience belongs peculiarly to life when it hunts its living food；and it belonged to Buck as he clung to the flank of the herd，retarding its march，irritating the young bulls，worrying the cows with their half-grown calves，and driving the wounded bull mad with helpless rage.For half a day this continued.Buck multiplied himself，attacking from all sides，enveloping the herd in a whirlwind of menace，cutting out his victim as fast as it could rejoin its mates，wearing out the patience of creatures preyed upon，which is a lesser patience than that of creatures preying.

As the day wore along and the sun dropped to its bed in the northwest（the darkness had come back and the fall nights were six hours long），the young bulls retraced their steps more and more reluctantly to the aid of their beset leader.The downcoming winter was harrying them on to the lower levels，and it seemed they could never shake off this tireless creature that held them back.Besides，it was not the life of the herd，or of the young bulls，that was threatened.The life of only one member was demanded，which was a remoter interest than their lives，and in the end they were content to pay the toll.

As twilight fell the old bull stood with lowered head，watching his mates—the cows he had known，the calves he had fathered，the bulls he had mastered—as they shambled on at a rapid pace through the fading light.He could not follow，for before his nose leaped the merciless fanged terror that would not let him go.Three hundredweight more than half a ton he weighed；he had lived a long，strong life，full of fight and struggle，and at the end he faced death at the teeth of a creature whose head did not reach beyond his great knuckled knees.

From then on，night and day，Buck never left his prey，never gave it a moment's rest，never permitted it to browse the leaves of trees or the shoots of young birch and willow.Nor did he give the wounded bull opportunity to slake his burning thirst in the slender trickling streams they crossed.Often，in desperation，he burst into long stretches of flight.At such times Buck did not attempt to stay him，but loped easily at his heels，satisfied with the way the game was played，lying down when the moose stood still，attacking him fiercely when he strove to eat or drink.

The great head drooped more and more under its tree of horns，and the shambling trot grew weaker and weaker.He took to standing for long periods，with nose to the ground and dejected ears dropped limply；and Buck found more time in which to get water for himself and in which to rest.At such moments，panting with red lolling tongue and with eyes fixed upon the big bull，it appeared to Buck that a change was coming over the face of things.He could feel a new stir in the land.As the moose were coming into the land，other kinds of life were coming in.Forest and stream and air seemed palpitant with their presence.The news of it was borne in upon him，not by sight，or sound，or smell，but by some other and subtler sense.He heard nothing，saw nothing，yet knew that the land was somehow different；that through it strange things were afoot and ranging；and he resolved to investigate after he had finished the business in hand.

At last，at the end of the fourth day，he pulled the great moose down.For a day and a night he remained by the kill，eating and sleeping，turn and turn about.Then，rested，refreshed and strong，he turned his face toward camp and John Thornton.He broke into the long easy lope，and went on，hour after hour，never at loss for the tangled way，heading straight home through strange country with a certitude of direction that put man and his magnetic needle to shame.

As he held on he became more and more conscious of the new stir in the land.There was life abroad in it different from the life which had been there throughout the summer.No longer was this fact borne in upon him in some subtle，mysterious way.The birds talked of it，the squirrels chattered about it，the very breeze whispered of it.Several times he stopped and drew in the fresh morning air in great sniffs，reading a message which made him leap on with greater speed.He was oppressed with a sense of calamity happening，if it were not calamity already happened；and as he crossed the last watershed and dropped down into the valley toward camp，he proceeded with greater caution.

Three miles away he came upon a fresh trail that sent his neck hair rippling and bristling，It led straight toward camp and John Thornton.Buck hurried on，swiftly and stealthily，every nerve straining and tense，alert to the multitudinous details which told a story—all but the end.His nose gave him a varying description of the passage of the life on the heels of which he was travelling.He remarked the pregnant silence of the forest.The bird life had flitted.The squirrels were in hiding.One only he saw—a sleek gray fellow，flattened against a gray dead limb so that he seemed a part of it，a woody excrescence upon the wood itself.

As Buck slid along with the obscureness of a gliding shadow，his nose was jerked suddenly to the side as though a positive force had gripped and pulled it.He followed the new scent into a thicket and found Nig.He was lying on his side，dead where he had dragged himself，an arrow protruding，head and feathers，from either side of his body.

A hundred yards farther on，Buck came upon one of the sled-dogs Thornton had bought in Dawson.This dog was thrashing about in a death struggle，directly on the trail，and Buck passed around him without stopping.From the camp came the faint sound of many voices，rising and falling in a singsong chant.Bellying forward to the edge of the clearing，he found Hans，lying on his face，feathered with arrows like a porcupine.At the same instant Buck peered out where the spruce-bough lodge had been and saw what made his hair leap straight up on his neck and shoulders.A gust of overpowering rage swept over him.He did not know that he growled，but he growled aloud with a terrible ferocity.For the last time in his life he allowed passion to usurp cunning and reason，and it was because of his great love for John Thornton that he lost his head.

The Yeehats were dancing about the wreckage of the spruce-bough lodge when they heard a fearful roaring and saw rushing upon them an animal the like of which they had never seen before.It was Buck，a live hurricane of fury，hurling himself upon them in a frenzy to destroy.He sprang at the foremost man（it was the chief of the Yeehats），ripping the throat wide open till the rent jugular spouted a fountain of blood.He did not pause to worry the victim，but ripped in passing，with the next bound tearing wide the throat of a second man.There was no withstanding him.He plunged about in their very midst，tearing，rending，destroying，in constant and terrific motion which defied the arrows they discharged at him.In fact，so inconceivably rapid were his movements，and so closely were the Indians tangled together，that they shot one another with the arrows；and one young hunter，hurling a spear at Buck in mid air，drove it through the chest of another hunter with such force that the point broke through the skin of the back and stood out beyond.Then a panic seized the Yeehats，and they fled in terror to the woods，proclaiming as they fled the advent of the Evil Spirit.

And truly Buck was the Fiend incarnate，raging at their heels and dragging them down like deer as they raced through the trees.It was a fateful day for the Yeehats.They scattered far and wide over the country，and it was not till a week later that the last of the survivors gathered together in a lower valley and counted their losses.As for Buck，wearying of the pursuit，he returned to the desolated camp.He found Pete where he had been killed in his blankets in the first moment of surprise.Thornton's desperate struggle was fresh-written on the earth，and Buck scented every detail of it down to the edge of a deep pool.By the edge，head and fore feet in the water，lay Skeet，faithful to the last.The pool itself，muddy and discolored from the sluice boxes，effectually hid what it contained，and it contained John Thornton；for Buck followed his trace into the water，from which no trace led away.

All day Buck brooded by the pool or roamed restlessly about the camp.Death，as a cessation of movement，as a passing out and away from the lives of the living，he knew，and he knew John Thornton was dead.It left a great void in him，somewhat akin to hunger，but a void which ached and ached，and which food could not fill.At times，when he paused to contemplate the carcasses of the Yeehats，he forgot the pain of it；and at such times he was aware of a great pride in himself—a pride greater than any he had yet experienced.He had killed man，the noblest game of all，and he had killed in the face of the law of club and fang.He sniffed the bodies curiously.They had died so easily.It was harder to kill a husky dog than them.They were no match at all，were it not for their arrows and spears and clubs.Thenceforward he would be unafraid of them except when they bore in their hands their arrows，spears，and clubs.

Night came on，and a full moon rose high over the trees into the sky，lighting the land till it lay bathed in ghostly day.And with the coming of the night，brooding and mourning by the pool，Buck became alive to a stirring of the new life in the forest other than that which the Yeehats had made.He stood up，listening and scenting.From far away drifted a faint，sharp yelp，followed by a chorus of similar sharp yelps.As the moments passed the yelps grew closer and louder.Again Buck knew them as things heard in that other world which persisted in his memory.He walked to the centre of the open space and listened.It was the call，the many-noted call，sounding more luringly and compellingly than ever before.And as never before，he was ready to obey.John Thornton was dead.The last tie was broken.Man and the claims of man no longer bound him.

Hunting their living meat，as the Yeehats were hunting it，on the flanks of the migrating moose，the wolf pack had at last crossed over from the land of streams and timber and invaded Buck's valley.Into the clearing where the moonlight streamed，they poured in a silvery flood；and in the centre of the clearing stood Buck，motionless as a statue，waiting their coming.They were awed，so still and large he stood，and a moment's pause fell，till the boldest one leaped straight for him.Like a flash Buck struck，breaking the neck.Then he stood，without movement，as before，the stricken wolf rolling in agony behind him.Three others tried it in sharp succession；and one after the other they drew back，streaming blood from slashed throats or shoulders.

This was sufficient to fling the whole pack forward，pell-mell，crowded together，blocked and confused by its eagerness to pull down the prey.Buck's marvellous quickness and agility stood him in good stead.Pivoting on his hind legs，and snapping and gashing，he was everywhere at once，presenting a front which was apparently unbroken so swiftly did he whirl and guard from side to side.But to prevent them from getting behind him，he was forced back，down past the pool and into the creek bed，till he brought up against a high gravel bank.He worked along to a right angle in the bank which the men had made in the course of mining，and in this angle he came to bay，protected on three sides and with nothing to do but face the front.

And so well did he face it，that at the end of half an hour the wolves drew back discomfited.The tongues of all were out and lolling，the white fangs showing cruelly white in the moonlight.Some were lying down with heads raised and ears pricked forward；others stood on their feet，watching him；and still others were lapping water from the pool.One wolf，long and lean and gray，advanced cautiously，in a friendly manner，and Buck recognized the wild brother with whom he had run for a night and a day.He was whining softly，and，as Buck whined，they touched noses.

Then an old wolf，gaunt and battle-scarred，came forward.Buck writhed his lips into the preliminary of a snarl，but sniffed noses with him.Whereupon the old wolf sat down，pointed nose at the moon，and broke out the long wolf howl.The others sat down and howled.And now the call came to Buck in unmistakable accents.He，too，sat down and howled.This over，he came out of his angle and the pack crowded around him，sniffing in half-friendly，half-savage manner.The leaders lifted the yelp of the pack and sprang away into the woods.The wolves swung in behind，yelping in chorus.And Buck ran with them，side by side with the wild brother，yelping as he ran.

And here may well end the story of Buck.The years were not many when the Yeehats noted a change in the breed of timber wolves；for some were seen with splashes of brown on head and muzzle，and with a rift of white centring down the chest.But more remarkable than this，the Yeehats tell of a Ghost Dog that runs at the head of the pack.They are afraid of this Ghost Dog，for it has cunning greater than they，stealing from their camps in fierce winters，robbing their traps，slaying their dogs，and defying their bravest hunters.

Nay，the tale grows worse.Hunters there are who fail to return to the camp，and hunters there have been whom their tribesmen found with throats slashed cruelly open and with wolf prints about them in the snow greater than the prints of any wolf.Each fall，when the Yeehats follow the movement of the moose，there is a certain valley which they never enter.And women there are who become sad when the word goes over the fire of how the Evil Spirit came to select that valley for an abiding place.

In the summers there is one visitor，however，to that valley，of which the Yeehats do not know.It is a great，gloriously coated wolf，like，and yet unlike，all other wolves.He crosses alone from the smiling timber land and comes down into an open space among the trees.Here a yellow stream flows from rotted moose-hide sacks and sinks into the ground，with long grasses growing through it and vegetable mould overrunning it and hiding its yellow from the sun；and here he muses for a time，howling once，long and mournfully，ere he departs.

But he is not always alone.When the long winter nights come on and the wolves follow their meat into the lower valleys，he may be seen running at the head of the pack through the pale moonlight or glimmering borealis，leaping gigantic above his fellows，his great throat a-bellow as he sings a song of the younger world，which is the song of the pack.
