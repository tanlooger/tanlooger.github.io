本书作者弗朗西丝·霍奇森·伯内特是著名的儿童文学作家，1849年生于英国。她16岁时，父亲溘然去世，举家移民到了美国，从此她由大英帝国的臣民变为美利坚合众国的公民，直到1924年在美国逝世。也因此，在英国文学史和美国文学史中，都有她的一席之地。

弗朗西丝·霍奇森·伯内特对自己的国籍定位恐怕是双重的、两可的，也可能是矛盾的。

本书是她创作的三部最著名的小说中的一部（另两部是《小公主》和《秘密花园》），初版于1886年。那个年代的英国号称“日不落帝国”，是世界头号强国，很像今天的美国。英国又有悠久的文化传统，崇尚所谓的绅士风度，当然会瞧不起外人，尤其是新兴的美国人。英国人认为美国人既无传统，又无风度。

本书中的老伯爵及其律师就是这样的英国人的代表。老伯爵是英国一个有钱有势的老牌贵族，“极端讨厌美国和美国人”。他“不习惯美国人和美国的习俗……对美国人一向没有好的评价”。他想当然地认为，许许多多美国人都自私自利、唯利是图。美国人崇尚自由，他认为那是野蛮、冒失和糟糕。他甚至对美国人奉为行为圭臬的“独立”人格都嗤之以鼻：“我才不欣赏呢！只是美国式的独立！”他有三个儿子，小儿子塞德里克最优秀，但仅仅因为他娶了一个普通的美国女孩，他就跟儿子断绝了父子关系。在他儿子夭折之后，他“依然憎恨这个温柔的小寡妇，总是用辛辣而残酷的话提起儿媳妇，或者干脆就不愿意说到她”。因为他认为，那女孩“是用伎俩使他儿子娶她为妻的，因为她知道他儿子是伯爵的儿子”。他总是说她“别有用心”。

只是因为三个儿子都死了，没有继承人了，而他自己也疾病缠身，行将就木，他才差人寻找到塞德里克的儿子——小塞德里克——本书的主人公。他平生讨厌小孩，之所以要把小塞德里克接到自己的身边，仅仅是因为他要有一个继承人，而且这个继承人，必须足够配得上万贯家财和家族名望，而他相信，“这孩子如果在美国长大，将成为一个小丑似的家伙”。可见，他顽固地认为，美国那样的环境根本培养不了优秀人才，反而会把好人变成坏人。

不过，他的小孙子优秀得有口皆碑，近乎完美，连他那副铁石心肠也被孩子的天真、聪慧和机灵所深深折服。而这孩子是在美国的环境里长大的，是他的母亲一手培养起来的；因为那小母亲，也近乎完美——漂亮、贤淑、谨慎，“任何一位绅士一眼就可以看出，她的一切都很得体”。为了儿子的前途，甘愿牺牲自己的一切。

但是，老伯爵并没有因为那个美国女孩为他生育了如此优秀的孙子而感谢她或原谅她，还在为她曾经“勾引”自己的儿子走入“歧途”而耿耿于怀，不但不愿意见她，甚至让她跟她的宝贝儿子分开住，限制他们母子的见面机会。好歹毒也！老伯爵曾粗野地从牙缝里吐出这几个词：“我该说他们那些人都不讲情谊！想到她，我就感到厌恶！一个唯利是图的、尖声尖气的美国人！我不希望见她！”

老伯爵的律师哈维沙姆先生一直生活在英国，也是一个英国至上分子，但他并没有老伯爵的偏执和顽固，他曾反驳伯爵说，不能仅仅因为“美国血统”而否定小塞德里克。他很理性，也很注重实际。在与小塞德里克进行一番谈话之后，他认定，小家伙“是可以被信赖的”。其实，普通英国人并不太在意英国人和美国人的差异，他们更看重的是好人还是坏人，所谓百姓心中自有一杆秤。如伯爵的仆人之一托马斯根据自己的观感，对小塞德里克的母亲得出这样的结论：“不管是不是美国人，任何一位绅士一眼就可以看出，她的一切都很得体。”

英国老贵族看不起美国人；普通美国人呢，在独立战争之后，也看不起英国人，尤其是英国贵族，甚至是仇恨。与老伯爵相对的角色，是美国人霍布斯，他是杂货店小老板，曾经明确表示：绝对不允许伯爵这样的贵族坐在他店里。他有一定程度的“仇贵”心理。同时，他是爱国者，深为美国的政治制度和国民理念而自豪，如追求民主与和平等。霍布斯教育小塞德里克树立的自我身份意识：他是美国人，而不是英国人，尽管他父亲是英国贵族。他对英国贵族和英国政府具有强烈的对立情绪，当小塞德里克的勋爵地位受到挑战而变得岌岌可危时，他说：“我的看法是，这整个都是英国贵族们预先布置的骗局，他们剥夺了他的权利，因为他是一个美国人。自从独立战争以来，他们一直厌恨我们，现在在他身上发泄了厌恨……整个英国政府勾结起来，剥夺了他的合法财产。”

小塞德里克则是对立的统一，有时承担着调停者的作用。当老伯爵严肃地说他“是一个英国人”，因为他“父亲是英国人”时，他反驳说，他是美国人，因为他生在美国，因为“霍布斯先生告诉我，如果美国和英国再次开战，您知道，我得——得站在美国一边”。正是在霍布斯的影响和引导下，他满脑子的共和和总统。但与霍布斯不同，他对贵族身份一开始就不排斥，尤其当他从实用的伦理角度出发，意识到贵族身份不仅意味着有钱有势，而且意味着能为他人尤其是社会底层的人们提供更多的帮助时，他欣然接受了这一身份。况且，他是反对战争的，他说：“如果英国和美国再次开战，我将设法制止。”

经过小塞德里克个人魅力有意无意的影响，老伯爵和霍布斯的极端思想和对立情绪受到了削弱，最终基本上完全消失。老伯爵不仅接纳了美国女人生的孙子，还接纳了那个曾让他深恶痛绝的美国女人，意识到了母子俩的美好品质是“美国制造”。霍布斯的观念则更是有了一百八十度的转变。小说最后，当他被问及是否愿意回美国时，他严肃地摇摇头说他不想生活在美国了，因为美国“固然是好得不能再好，朝气蓬勃而且激动人心——但也有问题——那儿没有三姑六姨，也没有伯爵！”

本书是儿童文学经典作品，但同时也适合成年人阅读，以上就是本人作为一个成年人的一种读法。

本书的书名有不同的译法，最初被译为《小伯爵》，现在还有个别译者这样翻译，个人认为这是不对的。因为，在整部小说的叙述中，不止一个地方明确说，小塞德里克是“方特勒罗伊勋爵”，或者，只是“多林考特伯爵领地的真正继承人”，“将成为多林考特伯爵”，而目前还不是多林考特伯爵，要等老伯爵去世之后，他才能成为伯爵。有人译为“爵爷”，也不恰当，因为“爷”如果前面不加“少”字，一般都是指“老爷”，而小说主人公是一个孩子，如何能称“爷”呢？





第一章　大吃一惊


这到底是怎么一回事？塞德里克一点儿概念都没有。他只知道爸爸是一个英国人，因为妈妈曾经告诉过他。但是，在他还是个小不点儿的时候，爸爸就去世了，所以，在他脑子里，关于爸爸的记忆很少。他只记得，爸爸的个头高高的，眼睛蓝蓝的，胡子长长的。还有啊，坐在爸爸的肩膀上，在屋子里转啊转，可好玩儿了。

自从爸爸去世后，塞德里克发觉，最好也不要跟妈妈谈论爸爸。他记得那时候，爸爸生病了，妈妈也病得不轻，而他被别人带到了别的地方；等他回来的时候，一切都完了，家里只剩下妈妈一个人，她刚刚能够费力地坐上窗边的椅子。她穿着黑色的丧服，身体瘦弱，面色苍白，美丽的脸上两个酒窝都消失了，哀伤的眼睛看上去比以前更大了。

“最最亲爱的，”塞德里克说（爸爸总是那样称呼妈妈，所以小不点儿也学会了），“最最亲爱的，爸爸他好些了吗？”

他感到妈妈的胳膊在颤抖，所以他转过鬈毛头，盯着妈妈的脸，那脸上有一种让他感到想哭的表情。

“最最亲爱的，”他说，“爸爸的病好了吗？”

就在那时，他那颗小小的“爱”心突然告诉他，他最好用双臂环抱妈妈的脖子，用温软的脸颊贴近她的脸颊，然后一遍遍地吻她。当他这么做时，妈妈把脸搁在他的肩膀上，哭得肠子都快断了。她紧紧地抱住他，就好像再也不想让他离开身边似的。

“是的，他好了，”妈妈啜泣着说，“他很好，很好。可是咱们——现在就剩下咱们俩了，再没有别人了。”

那时，尽管他很小，不能理解这到底是怎么一回事，到底是什么东西给他们家带来了如此的悲哀，但他明白，他的高大、英俊而年轻的爸爸死了，再也不会回来了。

每当他谈起爸爸，妈妈就会一个劲儿地哭，所以他暗暗下定决心，最好不要经常提起爸爸。他还发觉，最好不要让妈妈静静地坐着、看着炉火，或望着窗外，一动不动，一声不吭。

塞德里克和妈妈都极少结识人，过着一种在一般人看来十分孤独的生活。尽管直到他长大了一点儿，知道没有人来访问他们的原因后，他才意识到他们过的是一种孤独的生活。

塞德里克听说，妈妈曾是一个孤儿，爸爸跟她结婚之前，她一直是孤零零一个人。她非常漂亮，陪侍着一位富裕而年老的夫人，那位夫人对她一点儿也不好。有一天，塞德里克·埃罗尔上尉来拜访夫人，一眼就看见妈妈急急忙忙地跑上楼梯去，眼睫毛上挂满了泪珠。她看上去是那样的甜美、天真而又悲伤，上尉再也忘不了她了。

后来发生了许多奇怪的事情，他们俩相互熟知，进而又倾心相爱、结婚；但是他们的婚姻给他们带来的却是几个人的敌意，其中最感到气愤的不是别人，恰恰是上尉的父亲。老头儿生活在英国，是一个有钱有势的老牌贵族。他的脾气坏透了，极端讨厌美国和美国人。塞德里克上尉还有两个哥哥。按照英国法律，只有老大才有权利继承家族无比荣耀的封号和无比庞大的财产。如果老大死了，就由老二继承。所以尽管上尉是这样一个大家族的成员，但他几乎没有机会成为富人。

不过，多亏造化给了他一些他的哥哥们所不具备的馈赠。他身材匀称，体魄健壮，举止优雅，脸长得很清秀；他的笑容灿烂，声音甜润而快乐；他勇敢而慷慨，具有世界上最美好的心灵；他似乎有一种特殊的魅力，能让所有的人喜爱他。

他的兄长们就不一样了。那两个人都不英俊，也不友善、不聪明。他们在伊顿中学上学的时候，一点儿也不出名；后来上大学的时候，对学习一点儿兴趣都没有，只是耗费时间和金钱罢了。他们连一个真心的朋友都没有。

他们的父亲——那位伯爵老爷为他们感到失望和耻辱。他的继承人实在配不上贵族的名誉，到最后都可能不具备男子汉气概和贵族气质，而只是自私的、乱花钱的俗人罢了。上帝把所有的力和美都赐予了老三，而老三毕竟只是老三，他只能得到一份极少的财产。一想到这里，伯爵老爷就感到很难过。有时候，他几乎变得厌恶英俊的小儿子，因为小儿子似乎具备所有的优良素质，真正配得上荣耀的封号和庞大的财产。不过，在他那颗傲慢的、僵化的、年老的心灵深处，他情不自禁地对小儿子寄予了厚望。

有一回，伯爵老爷的坏脾气发作了，遂打发小儿子离开英国，去美国旅行。他觉得让小儿子离开一段时间，自己就不会老是拿他和他的哥哥们做比较而恼火了。那段时间，那两个粗野的家伙惹得他烦恼不堪。

但是，大约六个月后，伯爵开始感到孤单，暗暗地盼望小儿子能够回来，于是他写信给塞德里克上尉，命令他回家。上尉也刚好给父亲写了一封信，说他爱上了一个漂亮的美国女孩，打算跟她结婚。

伯爵老爷读了儿子的来信，大发雷霆。他的脾气一向很坏，但从来没有像这一次这么坏。在他火气冲天的时候，他的随从正好也在房间里，还以为他得了中风呢。他像一头猛虎似的，狂怒了一个小时。然后，他坐下来，给小儿子写信，命令小儿子永远不要再靠近老家，也不要再给父亲和哥哥们写信。老伯爵告诉埃罗尔上尉说，他愿意怎么活，就怎么活；愿意在哪儿死，就在哪儿死。老伯爵还告诉他，他已经永远地和家族断绝了关系，在自己的有生之年，他就不要再妄想得到任何帮助。

上尉读了父亲的来信非常难过。他爱英国，爱自己出生的美丽家园，甚至爱他那坏脾气的老父亲。在父亲失望的时候，他总是同情他。但是，他知道，他将来休想从父亲那儿得到任何仁慈。

一开始，他不知道自己能干什么。在他的成长过程中，他从没学过工作，也没有任何做生意的经历。不过，他有勇气、有决心。

于是他交出了自己在英国军队中的职权。经过一阵艰辛后，他在纽约找到了一个职位，随即跟心爱的姑娘结了婚。舍弃在英国的旧生活，在美国开始新生活，对他来说是莫大的改变。但是他年轻、乐观，心中怀着希望，他认为，只要辛勤工作，将来他肯定会大有作为。

在一条宁静的街道上，他有一处小小的居所。他的小不点儿就是在那儿出生的。一切都显得那样轻松、愉快、单纯。他娶了一个年老富婆的漂亮女仆，但他似乎从来没有为此而感到难过，因为妻子太甜美了。他太爱她了，她也很爱他。

她实在是太甜美了，而小不点儿既像她，也像父亲。尽管出生在这样一个既安和又清贫的小家庭里，但看起来似乎从来没有哪个孩子比小不点儿更幸运的了。

首先，小不点儿的状态一直很好，所以从未给任何人添过麻烦；其次，他的脾气是那样好，举止是那样讨人喜欢，他给每个人带来了快乐；再其次，他的容貌是那样秀美，看上去就像一幅画似的。

刚刚出生的时候，他不像一般孩子似的是个秃子，他的脑袋上长着许多柔柔的、细细的、金黄的头发，发梢都向上卷曲着，六个月的时候，成了一圈一圈稀松的鬈发。他一双褐色的眼睛大大的，睫毛长长的，小脸蛋人见人爱。他的脊背是如此的健壮，两腿是如此的结实。九个月的时候，他就突然之间学会了走路。对于一个婴儿来说，他的仪容是如此得体，任何陌生人见了他，都会觉得赏心悦目。他似乎感觉每一个人都是他的朋友。当他坐在街边的小童车里，任何人过来跟他说话，他都会用那双褐色的眼睛报以甜蜜而严肃的一瞥，紧接着是一抹可爱的、友好的微笑。

结果，在他生活的那条安和的街道上，左邻右舍中没有一个人不喜欢看看他，跟他说说话，甚至街角上那个杂货店的老板也喜欢他，要知道人们都认为那是一个坏脾气的家伙。一月又一月过去了，他越长越好看，越长越招人喜欢了。

在他足够大的时候，他会和保姆一起出去玩儿，拉着小车，穿着白色的苏格兰式短裙，一顶白色的大帽子倒扣在金黄的鬈发上。他是如此漂亮、健康、生气勃勃，因而引来了每一个人的关注。保姆一回家就告诉他妈妈，女士们是如何拦住他们的车，对他看啊看，跟他说啊说。当他以一副富于童趣的神态，高兴地和她们搭腔时，她们兴高采烈，就好像他和她们一直很熟悉。

他跟人交朋友时，总是显出无忧无虑、富有童趣的模样，这是他最吸引人的地方。他具有非常自信的天性，还有一颗善良的心灵，他同情每一个人。这使他能十分敏锐地捕捉到周围人们的情感。也许这份魅力是随着他的生长而增长的，因为他已跟父亲和母亲一起生活了好多年，而他们总是很温柔、很有教养，总是相亲相爱，处处为对方着想。在家里，他们从不说一个不友好的或不礼貌的词。父母一直爱护他、关心他，温和地对待他，所以他的童心里装满了友爱和温暖，还有天真无邪的情感。他经常听到父亲用美丽的、可爱的名称来称呼妈妈，所以当他跟她说话时，也学会了用这些名称。他经常看见父亲爱护着妈妈，无微不至地关心妈妈，所以他也学会了照顾她。

因此，当他知道爸爸再也不会回来时，当他看见妈妈是那么伤心时，渐渐地，在他幼小而善良的心灵里产生了一个念头，即他必须竭尽全力来使妈妈开心。他基本上还只是一个婴儿，但是，当他爬到妈妈的膝盖上吻她时，当他把鬈毛头放在她的脖子上时，当他将玩具、小人书拿给她看时，那个念头就会闪现在他心头。妈妈经常睡在沙发上，他也静静地蜷起身子，睡在她身边。他还没有长大到能知道为妈妈干些别的事，所以他能做什么就做什么。对妈妈而言，与其说他是理解了她，还不如说他是在安慰她。

“哦，玛丽！”有一回，他听见妈妈对年老的女仆说，“我确信，他试图用天真的方式来帮助我——我知道，他是想帮助我。有时候，他用一种充满爱意和迷惑的目光看着我，就好像他在为我难过似的。随后，他就走过来，拍拍我，或者给我看一件东西。他是一个小不点儿的大人，我真的相信，他懂得这一切。”

当他长大了一些后，他会用许多有趣的童稚的方式，逗得人们哈哈大笑，使人们对他的兴趣更加浓烈。对于母亲来说，他的陪伴至关重要，所以她极少关心任何别的人。他们俩常常一起散步，一起闲聊，一起玩耍。当他还是一个小家伙的时候，他就学会了读书；晚上，他常常躺在炉边的地毯上朗读——有时是一些小故事，有时是适合成年人读的大部头，有时甚至是报纸。这时候，在厨房里忙碌的玛丽经常能听见埃罗尔夫人被小家伙讲的趣事逗得咯咯直笑。

“事实上，”玛丽对杂货店老板说，“对于小家伙那些奇妙的言行，所有人都情不自禁地哈哈大笑——他那些大人气的话实在好笑。新总统被任命的那天晚上，小不点儿来到厨房里，站在火炉前，两手插在小口袋里，天真的脸上显出法官似的严肃，他整个看起来活像一幅画。他对我说：‘玛丽，我对总统选举非常感兴趣。’他说，‘我是一个共和党人，最最亲爱的妈妈也是共和党人。你是共和党人吗，玛丽？’‘有点儿抱歉，’我说，‘我是一个最最坚定的民主党人。’他抬起脸，看着我，那目光好像是要看到人心里，他说：‘玛丽，国将不国了。’打那以后，他一刻都不放过，总来跟我辩论，要改变我的政治立场。”

玛丽很喜欢他，也很为他感到骄傲。自从他出生起，玛丽就跟他妈妈在一起。他爸爸去世后，玛丽一直是他们家的厨娘、女仆和保姆，全面照顾着他们母子。

他那优美而健壮的小身体，可爱的举止，尤其是那头明亮的鬈发，时而波动在额头，时而迷人地披垂在肩膀上，让玛丽感到骄傲。她乐意起早贪黑地帮他妈妈给他做衣服，并使他的衣服保持笔挺的样子。

“他像个贵族，不是吗？”玛丽常常说，“真的，我喜欢看着这孩子快步走在纽约最繁华的第五大街上，就好像是去参加社交活动，看上去非常漂亮。不管是男人还是女人，不管是老人还是孩子，大家都乐意照顾他。他穿着一件黑色天鹅绒衬衫，那是用他母亲的一条旧裙子改成的。他的小脑袋高昂着，鬈发飞扬着，闪闪发光。他看起来可真像是一个小贵族啊。”

塞德里克不知道自己像一个小贵族，他不知道贵族是什么样的。他最好的朋友是一大街拐角处的杂货店老板。他叫霍布斯先生，脾气很坏，但从来没有对他发过脾气。塞德里克非常仰慕他、尊敬他。塞德里克认为霍布斯先生是一个有钱有势的人，因为他的杂货店里有很多很多东西——如杨梅干、无花果、橘子和饼干。他还有一匹马、一辆马车。塞德里克也喜欢送牛奶的人、烤面包的师傅以及卖苹果的妇女，但他最喜欢的还是霍布斯先生。他俩的关系是如此亲密，以至于塞德里克每天都要去看他。两人经常久久地坐在一起，讨论些时事话题。令人万分奇怪的是，他们找来交谈的事层出不穷——如七月四日国庆节就是一件。两人一谈起七月四日，就会谈个没完没了。霍布斯先生认为“英国佬”坏透了。他讲了独立战争的整个过程，叙述了一些非常精彩的爱国故事，故事中的敌人都很可恶，而战争英雄都很勇敢。他甚至会慷慨激昂地背诵《独立宣言》的选段。

塞德里克兴奋极了。他的眼睛闪闪放光，他的面颊红扑扑的，他的鬈发被他自己弄得乱蓬蓬的，活像一个黄色的拖把。塞德里克回家后，还没等吃完饭，就迫不及待地将今天听到的事告诉妈妈。也许可以说，是霍布斯先生最早使他对政治产生了兴趣。霍布斯先生很喜欢读报纸，所以，从他那儿，塞德里克听到了许多发生在华盛顿的事儿。霍布斯先生还会告诉他，总统是否在履行自己的职责。有一回，正好碰上选举，塞德里克觉得场面宏大极了。也许只有他俩认为这个国家可能已经被破坏了。

霍布斯先生带着他去看壮观的火炬游行。好多当时举着火炬参加游行的人们后来都还记得，一个粗壮的男人站在路灯杆旁边，肩膀上扛着一个漂亮的小男孩。那男孩一边大喊着，一边在空中挥舞着自己的帽子。

这次选举后不久，一件奇怪的事发生了，这事使只有七八岁的塞德里克的人生有了一个奇妙的变化。那天他正在跟霍布斯先生谈论英国和女王，霍布斯先生对贵族制度说了一些非常严厉的话，他尤其痛恨伯爵和侯爵。那天上午很热，塞德里克和一些小伙伴玩儿了一阵打仗游戏后，便来到杂货店休息。他看见霍布斯先生正在阅读《伦敦新闻画报》，一副凶神恶煞的样子，报纸上有一张关于宫廷仪式的图片。

“啊，”霍布斯说，“他们现在还能风光一时，但有朝一日，他们将为此付出代价。当那些被他们蹂躏的人们团结起来，就会将他们——伯爵、侯爵和所有的贵族都打个落花流水。这日子马上就要来了，他们该当心点儿！”

塞德里克像往常一样，坐在那只高凳子上，将帽子往后推了一推，双手插在裤兜里，对霍布斯先生毕恭毕敬。

“你认识许多侯爵吗，霍布斯先生？”塞德里克询问道，“或者伯爵？”

“没有！”霍布斯先生愤愤地回答道，“我想是没有。如果这屋子里有一个，我就会把他抓起来！我不愿意在这里，在我的饼干箱子上，坐着一个什么都想抓在手里的暴君！”

霍布斯先生为自己的这个想法感到骄傲，自豪地环顾了一下四周，擦了擦额头。

“也许，如果他们了解得多一些，他们就不愿意再当伯爵了。”塞德里克说。他感觉贵族们的处境挺不幸的，自己对他们还有点儿模模糊糊的同情呢。

“他们会吗？！”霍布斯说，“他们只会为爵位感到荣耀！这是他们根深蒂固的心理。他们生来就这么坏。”

这时玛丽进来，打断了他们的谈话。塞德里克原以为她可能是来买糖的，但她没有买。她脸色苍白，好像出了什么事。

“回家吧，亲亲，”她说，“太太要你回家。”

塞德里克从凳子上滑了下去。

“妈妈要我跟她一起出去吗，玛丽？”他问道。

“上午好，霍布斯先生。我会再来看您的。”

塞德里克看见玛丽盯着自己而说不出话来的样子，感到很惊讶，他想知道，玛丽为何一个劲儿地摇头。

“出什么事了，玛丽？”他问道，“是不是天太热了？”

“不是，”玛丽说，“咱们家出了怪事了。”

“是太阳晒得我那最亲爱的妈妈头疼了吗？”塞德里克急切地询问道。

但不是这么一回事。他回到自己家门口时，看到了一辆轿式马车停在那儿，还有一个人在小客厅里跟他妈妈谈着话。玛丽急急忙忙领他上楼，给他穿上一套奶油色的法兰绒衣服，脖子上围了条红色颈带，那是他最好的夏季服装。玛丽还梳理了他那头鬈发。

“老爷们，是吗？”他听见她在说，“还有贵族和绅士。呸！他们会倒霉的！老爷们，实际上，老爷们的运气会更糟糕。”

这话真正叫人摸不着头脑，但他相信他妈妈会告诉他，所有这些让人激动的事到底意味着什么。所以他听任玛丽自悲自叹，没有问她很多问题。衣服穿好后，他跑下楼，走进客厅。一个高高的、瘦瘦的，面部轮廓分明的老年绅士，此时正坐在一把靠背椅子上。他妈妈站在旁边，脸色苍白。他看见她的眼中噙满了泪水。

“噢！塞迪！”她喊出声来，跑向她的小宝贝，紧紧抱住他，吻他，让他感到有点儿害怕和忧虑。“哦！塞迪，亲爱的！”

那高个子老绅士从椅子里站起来，用锐利的目光看着塞德里克，同时用那瘦骨嶙峋的手摸着自己瘦削的下巴。他似乎一点儿都没有不高兴。

“如此说来，”他最后慢慢地说，“如此说来，这位就是小方特勒罗伊勋爵了。”





第二章　塞德里克的朋友们


在此后的那一个礼拜，世上从来没有一个小男孩儿比塞德里克更迷惑不解了。先是他妈妈告诉了他一个非常古怪的故事，他不得不听了两三遍才明白过来。他难以想象霍布斯先生会怎样看待这件事。故事的开头是，他从没见过面的爷爷，是一位伯爵老爷。到他爷爷死时，他的大伯父如果不曾从马上摔下来死掉的话，将继承爵位；大伯父死后，他的二伯父如果不曾在罗马溘然死于热病的话，也将继承爵位；二伯父死后，他自己的父亲如果还活着的话，也将是伯爵。但是，这兄弟仨都死了，只留下塞德里克这个独苗苗，所以看起来在他爷爷死后，他将成为伯爵——现在，他是方特勒罗伊勋爵。

当他初次听到这故事时，他的脸色都变白了。

“哦！最最亲爱的！”他说，“我宁愿自己不是一个伯爵。我的小伙伴们都不是伯爵。我能不做伯爵吗？”

但事情似乎没有转变的可能。那天晚上，当他和妈妈一起坐在打开的窗子旁，望着窗外破旧失修的街道时，他俩进行了一番长谈。塞德里克坐在他的小脚凳上，双手抱住一个膝盖，这是他最喜欢的姿态。他迷惘的小脸蛋因为思考而涨得红红的。他祖父派人来接他去英国，而妈妈认为他应该去。

“因为，”她目光哀伤，一边望着窗外，一边说，“我知道，你爸爸希望你去，塞迪。他很爱他的家。而且，有很多方面要考虑，你一个小男孩儿是很难理解的。如果我不让你去，我就是一个自私小气的妈妈了。等你长大成人后，你就会明白其中的原因。”

塞德里克哀伤地摇着头。“要离开霍布斯先生了，我将很难过。”他说，“我怕他会想我，我也会想他的。我会想念他们的。”

哈维沙姆是多林考特伯爵的私人律师，伯爵派他来将方特勒罗伊勋爵接回英国去。第二天哈维沙姆又来了，塞德里克从他那儿听说了许多事情。但是，当他听说他长大以后将成为一个很有钱的人，到处拥有城堡、广阔的园林、深深的矿井、大笔的财产和大批的佃户时，不知怎么的，他并没有感到安慰。他挂念着他的朋友霍布斯先生。早饭后，他就满怀忧虑地去杂货店看望朋友了。

他发现霍布斯先生正在读晨报。他十分严肃地走上前去。他觉得，霍布斯先生听到这突然降临在他身上的怪事时，肯定会大吃一惊的。在来杂货店的路上，他就一直在想，怎么样才能以最好的方式，将消息告诉霍布斯先生呢。

“你好！”霍布斯先生说，“早上好！”

“早上好。”塞德里克答道。

他没有像往常那样先爬到高凳子上去，而是在饼干箱子上坐下来，抱住膝盖，沉默了好一会儿。最后霍布斯先生抬起目光，从报纸的上端询问似的看着他。

“你好！”霍布斯先生又说。

塞德里克鼓起了心中所有的勇气。

“霍布斯先生，”他说，“你还记得昨天上午咱俩的谈话吗？”

“呃，”霍布斯先生答道，“好像是有关英国的。”

“是的，”塞德里克说，“但是就在那时，玛丽来找我，你记得吗？”

霍布斯先生拍了拍自己的后脑勺。

“那时咱俩正提到维多利亚女王和贵族制度。”

“是的，”塞德里克犹豫不决地说，“还有，还有伯爵，你不记得了吗？”

“哦，对了，”霍布斯先生答道，“我们是提到了伯爵，我记得的！”

塞德里克的脸一下子就红了，一直红到披垂着鬈发的额际。他平生还从未碰见过一件如此让他尴尬的事情。他有点儿担心的是，这件小事可能也会让霍布斯先生感到难堪。

“你说过，”他继续道，“你不会让他们坐在你的饼干箱子上。”

“我是这么说过的！”霍布斯先生激烈地答道，“我是这么说的，他们倒是来试试看！”

“霍布斯先生，”塞德里克说，“现在在这箱子上就坐了一个伯爵！”

霍布斯先生几乎要从他的椅子里跳出来。

“什么！”他大喊道。

“是的，”塞德里克有点儿羞怯地宣告道，“我是伯爵——或者说我将成为伯爵，我不想骗你。”

霍布斯先生看起来有点儿忧虑不安。他霍然站起来，转身去看温度计。

“你脑子里进水了！”他大喊着，转回身审视小塞德里克的面色，“今天很热！你感觉怎么样？头疼吗？你是什么时候感觉到不舒服的？”

他把一只大手放在小男孩的头上，这使塞德里克感到从未有过的尴尬。

“谢谢你，”塞得里克说，“我很好。脑子一点儿都没问题。我得说那是真的，我很难过，霍布斯先生。那就是玛丽到这儿来把我带回家的缘由。是哈维沙姆先生告诉我妈妈的，他是一个律师。”

霍布斯先生的身子沉入靠背椅，他用手帕擦了擦额头。

“咱俩中间有一个人中暑了！”他大喊道。

“没有，”塞德里克答道，“咱俩谁也没中暑。咱俩得想一个好办法，霍布斯先生。哈维沙姆先生从英国一直赶到这里，来把这事告诉我们。是我爷爷派他来的。”

霍布斯先生的眼睛死死地盯着眼前这张小脸蛋，它是那样天真而又严肃。

“谁是你爷爷？”他问道。

塞德里克把手伸进衣兜，小心翼翼地拿出了一张纸。

“我没法轻易地记住，所以写在了这上面。”他说完后慢慢地高声读了起来，“‘约翰·阿瑟·莫里钮克·埃罗尔，多林考特伯爵。’那就是我爷爷的名字，他住在一个城堡里——他有两个或三个城堡，我想。我那去世了的爸爸，是他最小的儿子。如果我爸爸没有死的话，我就不会是勋爵或伯爵。如果他的两个哥哥没死的话，他也不会是伯爵。但他们都去世了，只剩下了我一个继承人——男继承人，所以我得去当伯爵。我爷爷已派了人来，要把我接到英国去。”

霍布斯先生似乎感到越来越热了。他擦着额头和脑袋上没长头发的部位，重重地呼吸着。他开始意识到一件非常触目惊心的事已经发生了。但是，他看见那个小男孩依然坐在饼干箱子上，孩子气的眼里依然是天真而着急的神情，一点儿都没变，跟前几天一模一样，依然只是一个漂亮、快乐而又勇敢的小家伙，依然穿着黑布套装，围着红色颈带。这一关于贵族的消息使霍布斯先生迷惑不解，当他发现塞德里克说话时的语气是那样天真而单纯，就更加迷惑不解了。而塞德里克一点儿都没有意识到，这对于他来说，是一个多么惊人的消息。

“刚——刚才你说你的名字是什么来着？”霍布斯先生问道。

“是塞德里克·埃罗尔，方特勒罗伊勋爵。”塞德里克答道，“哈维沙姆先生就是这么叫我的。当我走进房去的时候，他说：‘这么说来，这位就是小方特勒罗伊勋爵了！’”

“哎呀，”霍布斯先生说，“我真该死！”

当他大吃一惊或极端兴奋时，他惯用这样的感叹。在那样令人困惑的当儿，他想不出另外的话。

塞德里克觉得这是一种相当合适的、适度的感叹。他是如此强烈地尊敬、爱戴霍布斯先生，以至于他欣赏、赞同霍布斯先生的所有看法。他对社会还了解得不够，这导致他不能意识到，有时霍布斯先生并不太遵循常规。他当然知道，霍布斯先生和他妈妈不同，因为他妈妈是一位女士，而在他看来，女士和男士总是不一样的。

他若有所思地看着霍布斯先生。

“英国离这儿很远，是吗？”他问道。

“得横渡大西洋。”霍布斯先生答道。

“那是最糟糕的，”塞德里克说，“也许要很长时间以后，我才能再见到你。我不愿想到那一点，霍布斯先生。”

“最好的朋友也得分开。”霍布斯先生说道。

“那么，”塞德里克说，“咱俩已经是好多年的老朋友了，是吗？”

“打你出生起，咱俩就是朋友了。”霍布斯先生答道，“在你只有六个礼拜大的时候，你妈就把你抱出来在这条街上散步了。”

“嗨，”塞德里克叹息着感慨道，“那时，我可万万想不到我得当伯爵！”

“你觉得，”霍布斯先生说，“没有办法摆脱了吗？”

“恐怕没办法了。”塞德里克答道，“我妈妈说，我爸爸希望我去当伯爵。但是如果我非当伯爵不可，那我能做的只有一件事，即努力做一个好伯爵，不当暴君。如果英国和美国再次开战，我将设法制止。”

他跟霍布斯先生的谈话很长，也很严肃。塞德里克原来料想，霍布斯先生会暴跳如雷。但一旦克服了一开始的震惊，霍布斯先生努力使自己恢复到了正常状态，在面谈结束之前，他又问了好多问题。由于塞德里克只能回答其中极少的几个，他只好极力让自己来回答。一谈起伯爵、侯爵以及勋爵的产业，霍布斯先生就解释了许多，他说的话如果让哈维沙姆先生听到了，可能会使哈维沙姆惊恐万分。

那时，有许多事使哈维沙姆先生感到惊恐。他以前一直生活在英国，不习惯美国人和美国的习俗。将近四十年来，他在业务上与多林考特伯爵家一直保持着联系。他知道伯爵家所有的大宗产业以及财富和地位。从冷酷的商业角度出发，他对这个小男孩很有兴趣，因为在将来，这个小男孩将成为所有这些财富和势力的主人，即多林考特伯爵。老伯爵对大儿子和二儿子的失望，对三儿子塞德里克上尉娶了一个美国女人的暴怒，这些他全都知道。而且他知道老伯爵依然憎恨这个温柔的小寡妇，提起儿媳妇时总是用辛辣而残酷的话，或者干脆就不愿意说到她。老伯坚持认为，她只是一个普通的美国女孩，她是用伎俩使他儿子娶她为妻的，因为她知道他儿子是伯爵的儿子。老律师自己也倾向于相信这一切都是真的。他平生见过许许多多自私的、唯利是图的人，而且他对美国人一向没有好印象。当他的轿式马车驶入这条简陋的街道，停靠在这座简陋的小房子前时，他真正感到了震惊。当他想到，这位将拥有多林考特城堡、温得汉穆塔林和考尔沃斯以及所有其他富丽堂皇的建筑物的未来伯爵，居然会出生、成长于这样一座不起眼的小房子，街道的拐角处居然还有一个卖蔬菜水果的杂货店时，着实吃了一惊。哈维沙姆先生想知道塞德里克是怎么样的一个孩子，那年轻的妈妈又是怎么样的一个女人，但一想到真要见到他们母子俩，他又有了退缩情绪。长时间以来，哈维沙姆先生一直为伯爵家办理法律事务，慢慢地也染上了贵族的傲慢。使他感到很恼火的是，他发现自己不得不去跟这样的一个女人打交道。在他看来，她是一个爱钱的俗人，既不尊重她亡夫的故国，也不尊重他神圣的称号。这个称号非常古老，非常辉煌。尽管哈维沙姆先生自己只是一个冷酷的、敏锐的、商人式的老律师，但他极其尊敬伯爵一家。

当玛丽把他领进小客厅时，他挑剔地环顾了一下四周。客厅的陈设很简朴，但看起来很有家庭气息，没有廉价的普通的装饰品，也没有廉价的俗丽的图片，墙上仅有的一些装饰品都具有高雅的品位。房间里散放着许多小东西，可能是女主人亲手制作的。

“如此看来，还不算太糟糕。”他自言自语道，“但也许是上尉的趣味起着引导作用。”但是当埃罗尔夫人走进房间的时候，他开始想，她的趣味可能也起了作用。她穿着简朴的黑色套装，跟她苗条的身材非常相配，她看上去与其说是一个儿子已七岁的母亲，还不如说是一个正值妙龄的女孩。她年轻的脸庞美丽而忧郁，褐色的大眼睛闪射出温柔而单纯的目光——自从她丈夫去世以来，忧郁的神情从未真正离开过她的脸庞。小塞德里克已习惯于看见妈妈脸上那忧郁的神情。仅有几次，他看见那忧郁的消退，那是在他和她玩耍、聊天的时候，在他说起一些老式物件的时候，当他在谈话中用了一个长单词的时候。那单词是他从报纸上挑出来的，或者是从跟霍布斯先生的闲聊中学来的。他喜欢使用长单词，尽管他不能理解长单词有什么可笑之处，但当它们使妈妈放声大笑时，他自己也总是乐滋滋的。老律师经验丰富，这使他能非常精准地观察人的性格。他一看见塞德里克的母亲，就知道：老伯爵认为她是一个俗气的、唯利是图的女人，是大错特错了。哈维沙姆先生从未结过婚，甚至从未恋爱过，但他推测到，眼前这年轻漂亮的尤物声音甜美，目光哀怨，她嫁给埃罗尔上尉，仅仅是因为她爱他，全心全意地爱他，她从来不曾认为，上尉是一个伯爵的儿子有什么优越之处。老律师明白，她不会给他制造麻烦。他开始感觉到，也许对于那个贵族家庭来说，小方特勒罗伊勋爵不是一个让人讨厌的人，一点儿也不。上尉是一个英俊的青年，年轻的母亲又这么漂亮，他们的孩子也许是让人百看不厌的。

一开始，当他将来意告诉埃罗尔夫人时，她的脸色变得非常苍白。

“哦！”她说，“你们非得要把他从我身边夺走吗？我们彼此是如此相爱！对于我来说，他就是至上的幸福！他是我的一切啊。我一直在努力做他的好母亲。”她年轻而甜美的声音颤抖着，眼中噙满了泪水。“你不知道，他对于我是何等的重要！”她说。

律师清了清嗓子。“我不得不告诉你，”他说，“多林考特伯爵对你——对你并不太友好。他是一个老人，有很强的傲慢心理。尤其是，他一贯不喜欢美国和美国人，对他儿子的婚姻更是怒气冲天。让我来传递这样一个让你不快的消息，我感到很难过。但他主意已定——谁也改变不了——他不想见你。他的计划是，小方特勒罗伊勋爵要在他的监督下接受教育，要跟他生活在一起。伯爵喜欢多林考特城堡，他长时间住在那儿。他患有痛风症，所以不喜欢伦敦。因此，方特勒罗伊勋爵可能主要生活在多林考特。伯爵把罗奇苑提供给你，作为你的住处。它的地理位置很好，而且离城堡不太远。他还会给你提供适当的收入，也会许可方特勒罗伊勋爵来看望你。唯一的规定是：你不准去看他，也不准进入城堡的大门。你瞧，你并不会真的跟你儿子分开。我向你保证，夫人，这些条件并不太苛刻，它们原本是可以更苛刻些的。我想你肯定知道，方特勒罗伊勋爵将要得到的生活和教育环境是相当优越的。”

他感到有点儿不安，因为她居然没有当场大哭大叫、大吵大闹。他知道，有些女人是会那样做的。一看见女人哭，他就会不知所措、心烦意乱。

但她没有哭闹。她走到窗户前，脸转过去，站了一阵子。老律师看见她在努力地使自己镇定下来。

“埃罗尔上尉很喜欢多林考特。”她最后说，“他爱英国，爱英国的一切。离开家园是他永久的伤痛。他为自己的家族和名号而骄傲。他愿意——我知道他愿意，让他的儿子了解那些美丽而古老的地方，并在那儿成长，以适应将来的地位。”

随后，她走回到桌子旁边，站在那儿，非常温和地抬眼看着哈维沙姆先生。

“我丈夫会同意的。”她说，“对于我的小孩子来说，这是最好的。我知道——我敢确定，伯爵不会那样心怀恶意，企图教导孩子不要爱我；我知道——纵使他真的那样做——孩子由于太像他的父亲，所以也不会受到伤害。他有一种温良、坚信的性格，有一颗真诚的心灵。纵然他看不见我，他也会爱我的。再说，我们俩是可以经常见面的，我不应该感到很大的痛苦。”

“她很少考虑她自己。”律师心想，“她没有为自己提任何条件。”

“夫人，”他高声说道，“你如此为你儿子着想，我很钦佩你。当他长大成人，他会报答你的。我向你保证，方特勒罗伊勋爵会受到最细微的保护，所有的努力都是为了保障他的幸福。多林考特伯爵会和你一样，为了孩子的舒适和健康而操心。”

“我希望，”温和的小母亲说道，嗓音都似乎碎裂了，“塞迪的祖父会喜欢他。孩子很有爱心，也总是人见人爱。”

哈维沙姆先生又清了清嗓子。他实在无法想象，那个患有痛风症、脾气暴躁的老伯爵会对任何人恩爱有加。但他知道，以他过敏的方式，对孩子好一点儿，对他自己是有好处的，因为孩子是他的继承人。他也知道，如果塞德里克能为贵族的名号增光，他的祖父会为他感到骄傲的。

“方特勒罗伊勋爵会过得很舒服的，我敢保证。”他答道，“只是为了他的幸福，伯爵才想着让你住得离他尽可能地近，能时常看见他。”

他认为一字不差地重复老伯爵用过的词是考虑不周的表现，事实上，老伯爵所用的词都是既不礼貌也不和蔼的。

哈维沙姆先生更喜欢用平和得多、礼貌得多的语言——来表示他那高贵的主人所提供的条件。

当埃罗尔夫人要玛丽去找她的小男孩，并把他带来见她，而玛丽告诉他小男孩正在杂货铺里的时候，哈维沙姆先生又受到了些微的震惊。

“没问题，我很容易找到他，夫人。”玛丽说，“因为此时此刻，他正跟霍布斯先生在一起，坐在柜台旁的高脚凳子上。他们极有可能在谈论政治，或者在肥皂、蜡烛和土豆之间自得其乐，正如你所喜欢的那样，既聪明，又可爱。”

“从他一出生，霍布斯先生就认识他了。”埃罗尔夫人对律师说道，“霍布斯先生一直对塞迪很好，在他俩之间有一种很伟大的友情。”

哈维沙姆先生想起他经过那个杂货店时，曾经瞥了一眼，一桶桶的土豆、苹果和各种各样的杂货仿佛又历历在目。想到此，他心里又起了狐疑。在英国，绅士的孩子是不会跟杂货店的老板交朋友的。如果孩子不懂礼貌或性情糟糕，竟然去跟下三流的人打交道，那是非常丢人的事。在老伯爵的一生中，最最让他感到痛苦的羞辱之一恰恰是：两个大儿子喜欢跟下层人交往。老律师想，这个男孩子会不会摒弃他父亲的善良，而继承了他那两个伯父的坏样儿呢？

在跟埃罗尔夫人聊天的时候，他一直不安地想着这一点，直到孩子走入房间。门打开的时候，他委实犹豫了一会儿，才去看塞德里克。当塞德里克跑进母亲的怀抱时，哈维沙姆先生低头看着这孩子。他体验到一种剧变的感觉，这感觉使他激动万分。他第一眼见到塞德里克，就意识到在他平生所见过的小家伙中，这孩子是最优秀的，也是最漂亮的。他超乎寻常地漂亮，孩子小小的身体健康、轻巧而又优雅，小脸蛋有着成年男人的特点，那孩子气的头高昂着，显示出相当勇敢的气质。着实让人感到吃惊的是，他和他父亲竟然如此相像。他继承了父亲的金色头发，母亲的褐色眼睛，但是，在他眼里，一点儿都看不出哀伤或胆怯。他的眼睛因为天真而无畏，他看起来就像自出生以来从未害怕过或怀疑过。

哈维沙姆先生想到的是：“他是我所见过的小家伙中，天生最最漂亮的。”而他说出来的话只是：“这么说来，这位就是小方特勒罗伊勋爵了。”

随后，他越看小勋爵，就越多地发现他的奇异。尽管他在英国见过许多孩子，但他对孩子所知甚少。英国孩子都是一些漂亮而又可爱的好男孩和好女孩，都经受过男的和女的家庭教师的严厉管教。他们有时候害羞，有时候喧闹得令人心烦，但从来不会对一个呆板的、死板的老年律师有多大的兴趣。也许小勋爵的前途关系到他个人的利益，才使他注意塞德里克要胜过注意其他孩子，但是，不管如何，他确实发现自己很关注塞德里克。

塞德里克不知道自己正在被观察，他的言行举止跟往常没有什么区别。当他和哈维沙姆先生被人介绍认识时，他友好地握了握哈维沙姆先生的手，并且毫不迟疑地回答了哈维沙姆先生的所有问题，正像平常他回答霍布斯先生的提问似的。他既不羞涩，也不鲁莽。当哈维沙姆先生和他母亲聊天的时候，律师注意到他怀着浓厚的兴趣在听着，就好像他已经长大了似的。

“他似乎是一个很成熟的小家伙。”哈维沙姆先生跟他母亲说。

“我想，在某些事情上，他是挺成熟的。”她答道，“他学东西一向很快，而且经常和成年人待在一起，他有一个小小的可笑的习惯，即喜欢使用比较长的单词和表达法，那是他从书中读到的，或者是从别人的谈话中听来的，但是他也非常喜欢孩子气的玩耍。我想他是相当聪明的，但有时候又是一个很孩子气的小家伙。”

哈维沙姆先生第二次碰见塞德里克时，知道他妈妈说的最后那句话是很正确的。当他的轿式马车路过拐角处时，他看见一群小男孩，他们都很兴奋。其中两个正准备进行一场跑步比赛，有一个正是他年幼的主人。塞德里克大声喊叫着，在他所有的小伙伴中，就数他的声音最大。他和另一个男孩子肩并肩站着，一条红色的小腿已往前跨出了一步。

“一——预备！”裁判喊道，“二——预备好了！三——跑！”

哈维沙姆先生发现自己的身子探出了马车的车窗外，他对眼前的情景产生了一种莫名的兴趣。他的小主人一听到起跑的号令，就沿着跑道像子弹一样射了出去，那两条高贵的红色小腿在灯笼裤后面飞跑着，在操场上一路狂奔。他的小拳头紧握着，他的脸迎着风，光亮的头发在脑袋后面飘散着，像涌动的溪流。

“加油，塞迪·埃罗尔！”所有的男孩都喊叫着，激动地跳跃着、尖叫着。“加油，比里·威廉！加油，塞迪！加油，比里！加油！加油！加油！”

“我真的相信他会赢。”哈维沙姆先生说，“我真的——我真的禁不住希望他会赢！”他说着，歉意似的咳嗽着。

那一刻，从那些又跳又蹦的男孩中爆发出一股最狂热的呼喊。未来的多林考特伯爵最后奇妙地一跳，到达了街道尽头的灯柱，触摸了一下，比里也气喘吁吁地飞身到达了灯柱，仅仅相差两秒钟。

“为塞迪·埃罗尔欢呼三声！”小男孩们喊道，“真棒，塞迪·埃罗尔！”

哈维沙姆先生把头缩回到马车的车窗边上，然后屈身回到座位上，脸上带着一丝干瘪的微笑。

“真棒，方特勒罗伊勋爵！”他说。

当他的车子停在埃罗尔夫人家门前时，比赛的胜者和负者走上前来，后面跟着那帮吵吵嚷嚷的男孩。塞德里克和比里·威廉一起走着，聊着，他那兴高采烈的小脸蛋通红通红的，他的鬈发垂到了滚烫的、潮湿的额头上，他的双手插在衣兜里。

“你看，”塞德里克说，“我猜想，我之所以赢，是因为我的双腿比你的要长那么一点儿。我觉得原因就在这里。你知道，我比你大三天，这是我的优势所在。”

塞德里克这么看待比赛的结果，比里·威廉高兴了起来，以至于又开始笑了，并觉得自己又可以大摇大摆了，简直好像是他赢了，而不是输了。不知出于什么原因，塞德里克想办法来使别人感到安慰。甚至于在他因刚刚赢得比赛而激动万分时，他还记得，失败的人可能不会像他那样感到快乐，还可能喜欢那样想，如果在不同的情形下，自己可能就是获胜者。

那天上午，哈维沙姆先生跟比赛的胜利者进行了一次相当长的谈话——谈得他露出了干瘪的笑容，还几次用他瘦骨嶙峋的手摸着他自己的下巴。

埃罗尔夫人被从客厅里叫了出去，律师和塞德里克单独待在一起。起初，哈维沙姆先生不知道自己应该对他的小伴侣说些什么。他想，也许最好是说些注意事项，以便塞德里克顺利去拜见他的祖父，或者以便他去应付那突然到来的变化。哈维沙姆先生看得出，塞德里克对他到达英国时将要见到的东西，对在英国等待着他的家，没有一点儿概念。他甚至不知道，他母亲将不再跟他生活在同一所房子里。他们以为，在告诉他之前，最好是让他先克服初始的震惊。

在打开的窗户的一边，哈维沙姆先生坐在一张靠背椅子里；在另一边，是一张更大的椅子，塞德里克坐在上面，看着哈维沙姆先生。由于椅子大，他坐得很靠里面。他满是鬈发的脑袋靠着靠垫，双腿交叉着，双手深深地插入衣兜。他妈妈在房间里的时候，他一直愣愣地看着哈维沙姆先生；在她走后，他依然看着，目光中流露出尊敬的思绪。埃罗尔夫人刚刚出去的时候，房间里有一种短暂的寂静。塞德里克似乎是在研究哈维沙姆先生，而哈维沙姆先生当然也在研究塞德里克。作为一个上了年纪的绅士，他不能下定决心，他应该对一个赢得了比赛的小男孩说些什么。这小男孩穿着短一截的灯笼裤、红色的长袜子。当他坐在靠背椅子的深处时，双腿由于不够长，还没能伸出椅面的边缘。

但是塞德里克突然主动开始谈话，这使哈维沙姆先生轻松了下来。

“我不知道伯爵是干什么的，”他说，“你知道吗？”

“你真的不知道吗？”哈维沙姆先生说。

“不知道。”塞德里克回答，“我想：当一个男孩要去当伯爵的时候，他应该知道，你不这样认为吗？”

“嗯——是应该知道。”哈维沙姆先生答道。

“你是否愿意——”塞德里克以尊敬的语气说，“你是否愿意给我解释一下（有时，当他说长单词的时候，他不会很准确地发音），是什么使他成为伯爵的呢？”

“首先，得有一个国王或王后。”哈维沙姆先生说，“一般而言，他之所以成为伯爵，是因为他曾经为王朝做出过某些奉献，或建立了某些丰功伟绩。”

“哦！”塞德里克说，“那很像总统了。”

“像吗？”哈维沙姆先生说，“你们的总统是那样选举出来的吗？”

“是的，”塞德里克愉快地答道，“一个人很好，或知道得很多，他就会被选为总统。他们举行火炬游行，还有乐队呢，每个人都发表演说。我过去常想，我可能会成为总统，但我从未想过成为伯爵。我不知道什么是伯爵。”他相当急速地说着，以防哈维沙姆先生认为他不懂礼貌，连伯爵都不想当。“如果我了解他们，我敢说，我原本想，我应该是喜欢去当伯爵的。”

“这跟当总统可大不一样。”哈维沙姆先生说。

“是吗？”塞德里克问道，“怎么个不同？没有火炬游行吗？”

哈维沙姆先生也把自己的双腿交叉起来，并小心地把手指尖放在一起。他想，也许到时候了，该把事情解释清楚些了。

“伯爵是——是很重要的人物。”他开始说。

“总统也是！”塞德里克插嘴道，“火炬游行队伍有五英里长，他们还燃放烟火，还有乐队演奏呢！霍布斯先生带我去观看来着。”

“伯爵，”哈维沙姆先生感到自己的立场相当不稳定，他继续说道，“往往属于非常古老的世系——”

“那是什么意思？”塞德里克问道。

“属于非常古老的家族——极为古老。”

“啊！”塞德里克说，双手在衣兜里插得更深了，“我想，那跟公园旁边那个卖苹果的老太太情况很类似。我敢说，她也属于古老的家族。她那么老，以至于你会感到惊讶——她居然能站起来。她有一百岁了，我想。哪怕天下雨，她也得出来。我为她感到难过，其他男孩也很难过。比里·威廉曾经有将近一块钱，我叫他每天去老太太那儿买五分钱的苹果，直到他把钱全部花完。他买了二十天，而一个礼拜后，他就吃腻了。不过，那时候——相当幸运的是——一个绅士给了我五十分钱，我就拿来全都买了苹果。那老太太属于那样古老的家族，但又那样穷，真让人为她感到难过。她说，她的血统已深入骨髓，而雨使情况变得更糟糕。”

塞德里克的小脸蛋天真又严肃，哈维沙姆先生看着这小伙伴，感到若有所失。

“恐怕你没有很好地理解我，”他解释道，“当我说‘古老的世系’时，我不是指多老的年纪，而是指很久以来，这样一个家族的名号是闻名全世界的；也许几百年来，在他们国家的历史上，秉承那个名号的人一直是众所周知、有口皆碑的。”

“像乔治·华盛顿，”塞德里克说，“我打出生起就听说他了，而且在我出生前很久，他就众所周知了。霍布斯先生说，他将永远不会被人们忘记，那是因为《独立宣言》，您知道，还有七月四日国庆节。你瞧，他是一个非常勇敢的人。”

“第一位多林考特伯爵，”哈维沙姆先生严肃地说，“四百年前就是伯爵了。”

“哦，哦！”塞德里克说，“那真是很久以前了！你把这告诉我最最亲爱的妈妈了吗？她会很感兴趣的。她一进来，咱们就告诉她。她总喜欢听古怪的事儿。伯爵除了当伯爵，还干些什么呢？”

“他们中有很多很多人帮助统治英国，有些人是勇士，在古代曾参加过大规模的战役。”

“我本人也喜欢战斗，”塞德里克说，“我爸爸就是一个战士，他是一个很勇敢的人——和乔治·华盛顿一样勇敢，也许那是因为他是一个伯爵——如果他不死的话，他已经是伯爵了。伯爵们都很勇敢，为此我很高兴。做一个勇敢的人——那是一种很强的优越感。我曾经老是害怕——黑暗中的东西，您知道。但是当我想起战争战争中的战士和乔治·华盛顿时——我那恐惧症就治好了。”

“有时候，当伯爵还有一种好处。”哈维沙姆先生那敏锐的目光紧紧盯住小男孩，脸上有一种非常奇怪的表情，他慢慢地说：“有些伯爵有很多钱。”

他的表情很古怪，因为他想知道，他的年轻的朋友是否明白金钱的力量是什么。

“有钞票当然好啰。”塞德里克单纯地说，“我但愿自己有很多很多钱。”

“真的？”哈维沙姆先生说，“那是为什么？”

“嗯，”塞德里克解释道，“一个人有钱，就可以干很多很多事儿。您瞧，那个卖苹果的老太太，如果我很富裕的话，我会给她买一顶小帐篷，让她把摊子摆在里面，再给她买一只小炉子，然后，每个下雨天的早晨，给她一块钱，那样她就可以待在家里了。再往后——哦！我要给她一条围巾，那样她的骨头就不会使她感觉难受了；她的骨头跟我们的不一样，她一动，骨头就使她感到疼。骨头疼起来真是要命啊。如果我有足够的钱，为她做所有那些事，我猜想，她的骨头就不会疼了。”

“说得真好！”哈维沙姆先生说，“如果你很富裕，你还会干些别的什么呢？”

“哦！我会做许多许多事儿。当然我要给我最最亲爱的妈妈买各种各样漂亮的东西，编织手册啦、扇子啦、金针箍啦、金戒指啦，还有百科全书啦、马车啦，那样，她就不需要去等街上的车了。如果她喜欢桃红色的丝绸服装，我会给她买一些，不过，她最喜欢的是黑色。我要带她去那些大商场，让她四处看看，自己随便挑选。还有迪克——”

“谁是迪克？”哈维沙姆先生问道。

“迪克是一个擦皮鞋匠。”小勋爵说。想到这样激动人心的计划，他的兴致一下高涨起来：“在你所认识的擦皮鞋匠中，他是最好的一个。他把摊子摆在城里一条街道的拐角处，我认识他已经有好几年了。在我还是个小不点儿的时候，有一回，我跟我最最亲爱的妈妈一起出去逛街。她给我买了个漂亮的皮球，就是能弹跳的那种，我带着它走，它滚进了街道的中央，那里车水马龙。我失望极了，就开始哭——那时我还很小，穿着短裙。迪克当时正在给人擦鞋，他说了声‘喂！’就冲进车马之间，抓住了球，用他的衣服把它擦干净，然后交给我，说：‘别哭了，小家伙。’因此，我最最亲爱的妈妈很欣赏他，我也是，打那以后，我们一进城，就去找他聊天。他说：‘你好！’我说：‘你好！’然后，我们就聊一聊，他把生意情况告诉我们。后来，他的生意不好了。”

“那你想给他做些什么？”律师问道。他摸着下巴，奇怪地笑着。

“嗯，”方特勒罗伊勋爵说，他在椅子里坐稳当了，一副正儿八经的样子，“我要出钱让杰克不再擦鞋。”

“那么谁是杰克？”哈维沙姆先生问道。

“他是迪克的搭档，这个家伙是一个坏得不能再坏的搭档！迪克是这么说的。他办事不讲信誉，而且不大方，还骗人，这使迪克快疯了。您知道，如果您竭尽全力擦皮鞋，一贯大方，而您的搭档一点儿都不大方，您肯定会发疯。人们喜欢迪克，但讨厌杰克，所以他们不会再来。所以，如果我很富裕，我就要让杰克停止擦鞋，而让迪克获得一张‘老板证’，他说‘老板证’很有帮助。我要给他买些新衣服和新鞋刷，让他公平地重新开始。他说，他所需要的就是公平地重新开始。”

小塞德里克讲着他的小故事，以坦诚、善良而忠信的语气，学着迪克说俚言俗语，神态无比可信，无比天真。他似乎感觉不到丝毫的怀疑，以为那位老律师也像他自己那样，对这些事很有兴趣。哈维沙姆先生确实开始产生了浓厚的兴趣，不过，他对迪克和卖苹果的老太太的兴趣并不大，也许他真正感兴趣的是这位小主人。男孩的脑袋上覆盖着金黄的头发，他的脑筋忙碌地转动着，为他的朋友们制订好新的计划，不知怎么的他似乎浑然忘了自己。

“你有没有想过——”哈维沙姆先生开始说，“你如果很富裕了，你为自己买些什么呢？”

“要买很多东西！”方特勒罗伊勋爵欢快地答道，“但首先，我要给玛丽一些钱，让她交给布里奇特——她的姐姐，她有十二个孩子，丈夫还失业。布里奇特到这里来直哭，最最亲爱的给了她一篮子东西，于是，她哭着说：‘漂亮的夫人，愿上帝多多保佑您。’我想，霍布斯先生会喜欢纯金打造的手表和表链，还喜欢海泡石制造的烟斗。然后我还想成立一家公司。”

“一家公司！”哈维沙姆先生惊叹道。

“就像共和党的大会，”塞德里克解释道，他变得很兴奋，“我要给所有的男孩和自己买火炬、制服和其他东西。我们要游行，你知道，还要操练。如果我富裕了，我喜欢做的就是这些。”

门开了，埃罗尔夫人走了进来。

“很抱歉，不得不让你在这儿待了这么长时间，”她对哈维沙姆先生说，“只因为有个贫穷的女人，家境很困难，她来看我。”

“这位年轻的绅士，”哈维沙姆先生说，“正在跟我讲他的一些朋友，以及如果他富裕了，他要给他们做的事。”

“布里奇特是他的一个朋友。”埃罗尔夫人说，“跟我在厨房里聊天的正是布里奇特，她现在有大困难了，因为她丈夫得了风湿病。”

塞德里克从大椅子里滑了下来。

“我想，我该去看看她。”他说，“问问她，她丈夫现在怎么样了。她丈夫身体好的时候，是一个很不错的人。我非常感激他，因为他曾经给我做了把木头剑，他是一个很聪明的人。”

他走出了房间，哈维沙姆先生也从椅子里站了起来。他似乎肚子里有话要说。他犹豫了一会儿，然后，低头看着埃罗尔夫人说：

“在我离开多林考特城堡之前，我跟伯爵面谈过，他给了几点指示。他老是以为，他的孙子应该会比较高兴地憧憬未来在英国的生活，还憧憬着跟自己相认。他说我必须让小勋爵知道，他人生中的这一变化将给他带来金钱和快乐，那是孩子们都喜欢享有的。如果塞德里克表达任何愿望，我都要满足他，还要告诉他，是他的祖父给了他所向往的东西。我意识到，伯爵不曾预料到情况会是现在这个样子。不过，如果帮助这个贫穷的女人，能给方特勒罗伊勋爵带来快乐的话，伯爵也会高兴的；如果孩子的助人愿望得不到满足，我想，老伯爵会不高兴的。”

这是第二次，他没有一字不差地重复老伯爵的话，实际上，伯爵是这么说的：

“让那个孩子明白，他想要什么，我就能给他什么。让他知道，成为多林考特伯爵的孙子意味着什么。他对什么东西有兴趣，你就给他买什么。让他的口袋里装满钞票，并且告诉他，是他的祖父把钱放在那儿的。”

老伯爵的动机远远谈不上善良，如果他所对待的人不像小方特勒罗伊勋爵那样——具有爱心的、热心的天性，也许早已造成极大的伤害了。塞德里克的母亲因为太温和，以至于怀疑有任何伤害。她想的是：也许这意味着，由于儿子们都死了，不幸的老人太孤独了，他现在想善待她的小男孩，想得到男孩的爱和信任。想到塞德里克能够帮助布里奇特，她感到非常高兴。好运突然降临到她的孩子身上，这产生的第一个结果是，小男孩能够为那些需要帮助的人做一些好事。想到此，她就更加高兴了。一股暖色洋溢在她年轻而漂亮的脸上。

“哦！”她说，“伯爵真好，塞德里克会非常高兴。他一直喜欢布里奇特和迈可尔。他们值得别人的帮助。我一直希望自己能更多地帮助他们。迈可尔身体好时，工作很辛苦。但他老早以前就病了，需要昂贵的药物、取暖的衣物和有营养的食物。别人给他们的东西，他们不会浪费一丁点儿。”

哈维沙姆先生把他瘦削的手插进胸前的衣兜里，拿出一个大皮夹子。在他热情的脸上有一种奇怪的表情。实际上他在考虑，当他去向伯爵汇报他的小孙子的第一个愿望是什么，以及他是如何去满足这一愿望的时候，不知道伯爵听了会说什么。他还想知道，那个脾气暴躁的、自私自利的老贵族会作何感想。

“我不知道你是否已经意识到了，”他说，“多林考特伯爵是一个极为富有的人。他能给钱，能满足孩子各种各样的要求。我想，如果他知道方特勒罗伊勋爵曾经沉迷于奇思怪想的话，他会高兴的。如果你把孩子叫回来，并且允许我行使我的职责，我将给他五个英镑，让他去帮助这些穷人。”

“那是二十五美元！”埃罗尔夫人喊道，“对于他们来说，那是一大笔财富了。我几乎不能相信这是真的。”

“这确实是真的，”哈维沙姆先生说，干瘪地笑着，“你儿子的生活已经发生了巨变，他的手中已经有了巨大的权力。”

“哦！”塞德里克的母亲叫道，“而他还是这么小的孩子——这么小的孩子。我该怎么教导他，让他好好使用这权力呢？这使我有点儿害怕了。我那漂亮的小塞德里克啊！”

律师微微清了清嗓子。看到她褐色的眼中那温和的、受惊的目光，他那颗年老的心虽老于世故、硬如铁石，也受到了触动。

“我想，夫人，”他说，“如果我可以从今天上午跟方特勒罗伊勋爵的面谈来判断的话，下一任多林考特伯爵将既为别人着想，也为他高贵的自身着想。现在他还只是个孩子，但是我想，他是可以被信赖的。”

随后，塞德里克的母亲去找他，并将他带回到了客厅里。在他走进房间之前，哈维沙姆先生听见他说：

“这是发了炎的风湿病。”他说，“是一种可怕的风湿病，迈克尔老想着还没付的租金。布里奇特说那使他的炎症更加严重了。如果迈克尔有些衣服的话，就能在某个商店里谋个职位。”

塞德里克进来时，小脸蛋看起来焦虑重重。他为布里奇特感到十分难过。

“最最亲爱的说，您要见我。”他对哈维沙姆先生说，“我一直在跟布里奇特说话呢。”

哈维沙姆先生低头看了他一会儿，感到有点儿别扭和踌躇。正如刚才塞德里克的母亲所说的，他还是个小不点儿呢。

“多林考特勋爵——”他开口道，随即无心地看了看埃罗尔夫人。小方特勒罗伊勋爵的母亲突然跪在他身边，用温柔的双臂环抱着他奶气的身体。

“塞迪，”她说，“伯爵是你的祖父，你爸爸的父亲。他非常非常好，他爱你，也希望你爱他，因为他的儿子们都死了，他希望你快乐，并且让别人也快乐。他很富有，他希望你拥有你喜欢的一切。他就是这样告诉哈维沙姆先生的，并且让他给你带来了很多的钱。现在你可以给布里奇特一些钱，足以让她去偿付租金，去给迈可尔买所需的一切。那样不好吗，塞迪？他不好吗？”然后，她吻了吻孩子滚圆的下巴。那孩子既兴奋，又惊愕，突然间脸上闪现出快乐的神色。

塞德里克的目光从母亲转向哈维沙姆先生。

“我能现在就拿到钱吗？”他喊道，“我能马上把钱给布里奇特吗？她正要走呢。”

哈维沙姆先生把钱交给了他。那是几张新版的干净的钞票，被卷成整齐的一卷。

塞德里克飞跑出房间。

“布里奇特！”当他奔入厨房时，他们听见他喊着，“布里奇特，等一等！这儿有些钱。是给你的，你可以去付租金了。我爷爷给我的钱，现在给你和迈可尔！”

“哦，塞迪少爷！”布里奇特以无比敬畏的声音喊道，“有二十五块呢，女主人在哪儿？”

“我想，我得去向她解释一下。”埃罗尔夫人说。

于是她也走出了房间，只留下了哈维沙姆先生一个人。他在房间里待了一阵子，然后走到窗前，站在那儿，若有所思地望着窗外的大街。他想起了多林考特伯爵。老伯爵此时可能正坐在城堡的书房里。书房很大，很气派，也很阴暗。他身患痛风病，孤苦伶仃，被豪华和奢侈包围着，但是没有人真正爱他，因为在他整个一生中，除了他自己，他从来没有真正爱过任何人。他一向自私、自纵、自负而且自狂。他是如此关心作为多林考特伯爵的他自己的快乐，以至于他一直没有时间替别人着想。对他来说，他所有的财富和权力，以及从贵族的名号和高贵的头衔那儿得来的所有利益，似乎都只是用来供自己寻欢作乐。现在他已是个老人，所有的激动和放纵带给他的只是病弱的身体和易怒的脾性，以及对世界的厌恶，当然世界也厌恶他。尽管他曾经辉煌一时，但是从来没有一个年老的贵族会比多林考特伯爵更加默默无闻，也很难找出比他更孤独的了。他时不时地举行盛大的宴会、宏大的狩猎聚会来使城堡宾客满盈。但是他知道，人们之所以接受他的邀请，是因为害怕他那张满是皱纹的老脸，以及他那冷嘲热讽的话语。他有着恶毒的舌头和尖酸的本性，惯于嘲讽别人，使别人不舒服，而自己从中得到快乐。他有权力这么做，因为那些人或敏感，或傲慢，或胆怯。

哈维沙姆先生对老伯爵刻薄而残忍的言行了如指掌，当他望着窗外宁静而狭窄的街道时，他想起了伯爵，旋即心中升起了那漂亮的小家伙的形象：小家伙正坐在大椅子里，以他那慷慨、天真而诚实的方式，说着他的朋友们的故事，有迪克的，还有卖苹果的老太太的。这一形象跟老伯爵形成鲜明的对照。哈维沙姆先生也想到了大宗的收入，美丽的、壮丽的庄园，还有财富以及权势，既可以用来行善，也可以用来作恶。而所有这一切都将属于一双胖乎乎的小手，小方特勒罗伊勋爵现在正把那双手深深地插在衣兜里。

“到时候，庄园的面貌将大不相同，”他自言自语道，“将大不相同。”

塞德里克和他母亲很快就回来了，他克情绪很高亢。他在自己的椅子里坐了下来，坐在母亲和律师之间。他的双手放在膝盖上，仪态十分优雅。布里奇特轻松了，愉快了，小勋爵脸上也露出了喜悦的光芒。

“她哭了！”塞德里克说，“她说她是因为高兴而哭。我以前从来没有看见人因为高兴而哭。我爷爷肯定是一个大好人。我原来不知道他是这样好的一个人。当伯爵真好——比我以前想得更加令人愉悦，我很高兴——我真的很高兴，我要去当伯爵。”





第三章　离家


在接下来的一个礼拜里，塞德里克对于做伯爵的好处越想越多，越想越好。在乘船去英国前的那个礼拜里，他干了许多古怪的事儿。很久以后，老律师还能记得，有天上午他们一起进城去看望迪克；有天下午，他们给了那个卖苹果的老太太一个大惊喜，他们在她的摊子前停下来，告诉她，她将拥有一顶帐篷，一个炉子，一条围巾，还有一笔钱。对老太太来说，这简直是太美妙了。

“因为我得去英国，去当勋爵。”塞德里克态度温和地解释道，“而我不想在每次下雨的时候，让你的骨头发痛，这让我心里难受。我自己的骨头从未伤痛过，所以，我想我不知道一个人的骨头疼起来会有多厉害，但是，我很同情你，也希望你好起来。”

“她是一个很好的老奶奶。”塞德里克对哈维沙姆先生说。他们离开了苹果摊子，留下那气喘吁吁的老太太。她一点儿也不相信自己的红运。“有一回，当我摔倒了，磕伤了膝盖时，她白送了我一个苹果。为此，我一直记着呢。你知道，谁对你好，你就会一直记着他。”塞德里克那颗小小的心灵诚实而单纯，从来没有想过有人会忘恩负义。

跟迪克的面谈很激动人心。正好杰克给迪克惹了许多麻烦，所以当他们去看迪克时，迪克情绪很低落。当塞德里克平静地宣称，他们来是为了给他一样东西，这东西在他看来似乎是非常重要的，而且能消除他所有的烦恼时，这几乎使他惊讶得目瞪口呆。小方特勒罗伊勋爵宣称他来访的目的时，神态非常单纯、平常。哈维沙姆先生站在一旁听着，这种直截了当的做法给他留下了很深的印象。迪克听说老朋友已经变成了勋爵，而且如果他年寿足够长的话，就有可能当上伯爵时，他吃惊不小，眼睛和嘴巴都张得大大的，帽子都从头上掉了下来。当他弯腰去拾时，他发出了奇异的惊叹，这使哈维沙姆先生觉得很奇怪，而塞德里克则以前就听到过迪克的惊叹。

“很抱歉！”他说，“你刚才告诉我们什么来着？”这话使小勋爵微微有点难堪，但是他使自己表现出了勇敢。

“一开始，所有的人都认为这不是真的，”他说，“霍布斯先生以为我中暑了呢。一开始我自己也不太喜欢，但现在已经习惯了，也就比较喜欢了。现在的伯爵——我的祖父，他让我喜欢什么就做什么。他还让哈维沙姆先生给我带来了许多钱，我给你带来了一些，你可以用这钱让杰克滚蛋。”

事情的结果是，迪克真的出钱支走了杰克，自己一个人拥有了摊位，拥有了那些新的鞋刷子以及整套工具，还得到了一张让人惊喜万分的营业执照。和那个有古老世系的卖苹果的老太太一样，他也难以相信自己的好运。他走来走去，就像是在梦中；他盯着眼前这位幼小的恩人，觉得自己可能随时会醒过来。直到塞德里克在离开之前，伸出手来，跟他握别，他似乎才勉强意识到了什么。

“那么，再见。”尽管塞德里克力图稳住自己说话的声音，但还是有点儿颤抖。他眨巴着他那双褐色的大眼睛说：“我希望你的生意好。很抱歉，我要走了，咱俩得分开了，但是也许当我成为伯爵的时候，我会再来。我希望你能给我写信，因为咱俩一直是好朋友。如果你给我写信，这儿是通信地址，你可得写清楚了。”他把一张小纸条交给了迪克。“我的名字再也不是塞德里克·埃罗尔了，而是方特勒罗伊勋爵——再见，迪克。”

迪克也眨巴着眼睛，看上去似乎连眼睫毛都湿润了。他没怎么受过教育，如果他试图说出那时那刻的感觉，他会感到很困难，也许那就是他干脆不做这尝试的原因。他只是眨巴着眼睛，嗓子眼里似乎塞了一块什么东西，哽咽着。

“我希望你别走，”他声音沙哑地说着，又开始眨巴眼睛，然后看着哈维沙姆先生，摸着他的帽子，“谢谢您，先生，谢谢您跟他一起到这儿来，谢谢您所做的一切。他是——他是一个奇怪的小家伙，”他又说道，“我经常牵挂着他。这小家伙胆子很大——还蛮古怪的。”

当他们转身离开的时候，迪克站在那儿，神情恍惚地目送着他们。他的眼里依然有一片湿雾，喉咙里依然有东西哽咽着。他看着那豪爽的小身影高高兴兴地沿着街道走去，随行的哈维沙姆先生显得又高大、又僵硬。

直到起程的那天前，小勋爵尽可能多地待在杂货店里，跟霍布斯先生在一起。阴郁降临到了霍布斯先生的脸上，他的精神很是沮丧。当他那年幼的朋友欢天喜地地给他拿来分别的礼物——金表和金表链，他甚至发现，很难用语言来准确地表示感谢。他把礼盒放在粗壮的膝盖上，有几次重重地抽着鼻子。

“我在上面写了几句话，在盒子里面。”塞德里克说，“我现在就告诉你吧，我写的是：‘老朋友方特勒罗伊勋爵致霍布斯先生，当你看到这些东西时，请记起我。’我要你记得我。”

霍布斯先生又一次非常响亮地抽了抽鼻子。

“我不会忘记你的，”他说，和迪克一样，他的声音也有点儿沙哑，“你也不要一跟英国贵族们在一起就忘了我。”

“不管我跟谁在一起，我都不会忘记你的。”小勋爵答道，“咱俩曾经在一起度过最美好的时光，至少，我感到是最美好的。我希望有朝一日你能来看我，我相信我爷爷也会非常高兴。我把你的情况告诉他后，也许他会写信邀请你呢。你——你不会介意他是一个伯爵，是吗？我的意思是，如果他邀请你来，你不会仅仅因为他是一个伯爵而拒绝吧？”

“我愿意去看你。”霍布斯先生宽厚地答道。

这下两人似乎达成了一致意见，即如果霍布斯先生收到伯爵的紧急邀请信，要他来多林考特城堡住上几个月，他会将他那些共和党的偏见放在一边，立即收拾行囊出发。

最后，所有的准备工作都做好了。那一天终于到来了，行李箱运到了轮船上；那一刻终于到来了，马车停在了门口。这时小男孩感到了一种奇怪的孤独。他妈妈把自己在屋子里关了一段时间。当她下楼的时候，她的眼睛看上去又大又湿，甜美的嘴唇也颤抖着。塞德里克走向她，她向着他弯下腰，他的双臂抱住她，他们亲吻着。他知道有些事情使他们俩都感到难过，尽管他不清楚到底是什么事，但是一个温柔的小小的念头升上他的双唇。

“我们喜欢这所小房子，最最亲爱的，是吗？”他说，“我们会永远喜欢它，是吗？”

“是的——是的，”她答道，声音又低又美，“是的，亲爱的。”

然后他们登上了马车，塞德里克紧挨着妈妈坐下。当她透过车窗回看的时候，他看着她，拍着她的手，并且紧紧握住。

随后，几乎是一眨眼的工夫，他们就到了轮船上，周围是一片狂野的喧闹和混乱：马车驶过来，旅客下车。大家都为行李心急如焚，因为行李还没有到，而且有迟到的危险。大大小小的箱子被乒乒乓乓地卸下来，在地上被拖来拖去；水手松开绳子，到处跑来跑去；官员们在下命令。女人、男人、孩子和他们的保姆来到轮船上——有人高兴地大声笑着，有人悲切地沉默不语。这儿那儿，人们三三两两地哭着，用手帕擦着眼睛。塞德里克到处都能发现让他感兴趣的东西。他看着成捆的绳子，看着翻卷的白帆、高高的桅杆，那桅杆看起来几乎要触及火热的天了。他开始制订计划，要跟水手聊一聊，想得到些关于海盗的信息。

就在轮船起锚的最后一刻，塞德里克站着，靠在上层甲板的栏杆上，观看着客船起航前最后的准备，欣赏着水手们和码头工人们激动的喊叫。离他不远处，有一群人微微地喧闹起来，将他的注意力吸引了过去。有人匆忙地拨开人群，向他走来。这是一个少年，手里拿着一样红色的东西。是迪克，他来到塞德里克跟前，几乎已上气不接下气。

“我一路跑来，”他说，“我来送你。我的生意一直好极了！这是我用昨天挣来的钱买的，你跟大人物在一起的时候，可以带着它。我在下楼穿过人群的时候，丢掉了那张包装纸，他们不让我过来。喏，是块手帕。”

他几乎是一口气把这些话全都说了出来，这时铃响了，他跳着走开了，而塞德里克还没来得及开口说话。

“再见！”他气喘吁吁地说，“你跟大人物在一起的时候，就带上它吧。”他飞快地离开塞德里克，走了。

几秒钟后，他们看见迪克拼命地挤过下层甲板上的人群，就在跳板抽上来之前的一刻，他冲到了岸上，站在码头上，挥舞着帽子。

塞德里克手里拿着手帕，这是一块闪耀着红色光泽的丝帕，装饰着紫色的马掌和马头。

场面紧张、混乱而嘈杂。码头上的人们开始对着朋友们喊话，船上的人们则回喊：

“再见！再见！再见，老伙计！”每个人似乎都在说，“别忘记我们，到利物浦就来信，再见！再见！”

小方特勒罗伊勋爵身子往前倾斜着，挥舞着那块红色的手帕。

“再见，迪克！”他急切地高喊着，“谢谢你！迪克！再见！”

大船离开了码头，人们又开始喊叫。塞德里克的母亲用面纱遮住自己的眼睛。岸上只余下一片混乱。但是除了那光亮的小脸蛋，除了那在太阳的照耀下闪闪发光的头发，那被风吹起的头发，迪克看不见任何东西；除了那发自心底的奶声奶气的呼喊。“再见，迪克！”，迪克听不到任何声音。小方特勒罗伊勋爵乘坐的轮船缓缓地离开了他出生的地方，驶向那片未知的祖先的土地。





第四章　在英国


在航程中，塞德里克的母亲告诉他，他未来的家将不属于她。当他听懂了其中的意思时，痛苦极了，以至于哈维沙姆先生真正明白了，老伯爵的安排是很明智的，即让塞德里克的母亲住得离他很近，而且能经常来看他。因为很明显，他无法忍受跟母亲的分离。但是他母亲用充满爱意的甜蜜的方式稳住了小家伙，使他感觉到她会离他很近。过了一会儿，他不再为害怕真正的分离而难受了。

“我住的房子离城堡不远，塞迪。”每次提到这话题，她就重复这句话——“离你的住处只有一丁点儿距离，你想来，每天都可以来看我，你会有许多事情要告诉我！我们生活在一起会很幸福！那是一个美丽的地方。你爸爸经常跟我说起它，他非常爱它，你也会爱它的。”

“如果你在那儿的话，我会更爱它的。”小勋爵说着，深深地叹息着。

对这样一种奇怪的安排，他只能感到迷惑，因为那会使他“最最亲爱的”住在一处，而他自己将住在另一处。

事实上，埃罗尔夫人认为，不告诉他这么安排的原因，也许更好。

“我宁愿不告诉他，”她对哈维沙姆先生说，“他不会真正明白的，他只会感到震惊，从而受到伤害。我敢保证，如果他不知道他祖父对我恨之入骨，他对老伯爵的感情会更加自然、更加深挚。他从未经历过厌恨或艰难，如果让他发现有人居然厌恨我，那将是对他的重大打击。他是如此地爱惜自己，我对他是如此的亲！直到他长大一些，再告诉他真相，也许对他来说更好些，对伯爵来说则更好得多。尽管塞迪还是一个孩子，但这会在他和他祖父之间造成障碍。”

所以塞德里克只知道是某个神秘的原因导致了这种安排，他还不够大，所以还不能理解这原因。尽管哈维沙姆先生时不时地看见他坐着，观看着大海，脸色非常严肃，一副老成的仪态有点儿怪模怪样。不止一次，哈维沙姆先生听见他的双唇发出孩子气的叹息，但是由于母亲跟他进行了好几次谈话，并且安慰他，将未来图景的光明面展现在他面前，所以他心头的阴影渐渐地消失了。

“我不喜欢这样。”有一回，当他和律师进行谈话时，他说，“你不知道，我很不喜欢这样。但是世上有很多很多麻烦，你得忍着。玛丽是这么说的，我听见霍布斯先生也这么说过。最最亲爱的希望我乐意跟我祖父在一起，因为，你知道，他所有的孩子都死了，真是太令人伤心了。当他的孩子们都死了——其中一个死得还很突然，你想他该有多难过。”

那些认识小伯爵的人通常感到高兴的是，当他兴致勃勃跟人聊天时，脸上总有一股贤明的神情，再加上他有时会做出成年人的评论，浑圆而幼稚的脸上又有着高度的单纯和严肃，总有一种不可抗拒的魅力。这鬈毛头小家伙是如此漂亮、红润，以至于当他一坐下，用滚圆的双手摸着膝盖，非常严肃地跟人聊天时，他就是愉悦的大源泉。渐渐地，从跟小勋爵的交往中，哈维沙姆先生也分得了许多的快乐。“这么说来，你将会喜欢伯爵了？”他说。

“是的。”小勋爵答道，“他是我的亲人，你当然得喜欢你的亲人，另外，他对我很好啊。当一个人为你做了那么多事儿，想让你拥有你所向往的一切，即使他不是你的亲戚，你也会喜欢他的。但是，当他是你的亲戚，又为你做了那么多事儿，你理所当然会喜欢他。”

“你觉得，”哈维沙姆先生提示道，“他会喜欢你吗？”

“嗯，”塞德里克说，“我想他会的，因为，你知道，我也是他的亲人，而且我是他的孩子的孩子，另外嘛，嗯，难道你没有看出来——他当然喜欢我，否则他不会让我拥有我所喜欢的一切的，也不会派你来看我的。”

“哦！”律师感叹道，“是那么回事吗？”

“是的，”塞德里克说，“就是这么回事，难道你不认为是这么回事吗？谁都会喜欢自己的子孙。”

晕船的人们很快就恢复了过来，他们纷纷来到甲板上，斜躺在椅子里，自得其乐。那时，所有人似乎都知道了小方特勒罗伊勋爵的奇怪故事，大家都对这小家伙产生了兴趣。他满船跑来跑去，或者跟他母亲一起散步，或者跟那又高又瘦的律师待在一起，或者找水手聊天。大家都喜欢他，他也到处交朋友。当先生们走上甲板，让他跟他们一起散步时，他会像个男子汉似的稳重地小步走着。当他们开玩笑时，他总是表现出享受到快乐的神情。当女士们跟他聊天时，人群里总会爆发出笑声，而他总是人群的中心。当他跟别的孩子一起玩耍时，大家总能玩得非常快乐。在水手中，他有最最知心的朋友。他听到了一些奇妙的故事，有关于海盗的、沉船的和荒岛的。他学会了捻接绳子，学会了给玩具船装帆，还学到了一些有关“中帆”“主帆”等的知识，这是很让人惊讶的。实际上，连他的谈话中都时不时加了一些航海气息。有一回，一群女士和先生坐在甲板上，罩着围巾和外衣，他在他们中间突然大笑起来，甜甜地说了一句非常吸引人的话：

“真见鬼，可这天多冷啊！”

当他们哈哈大笑时，他反而感到了惊讶。他是从一名叫作杰丽的“老船员”那儿偶然听来这一航海用语的。杰丽在给他讲故事的时候，经常说“真见鬼”！从杰丽自己的冒险故事来判断，他曾经有过两三千次航行经历，每次到遍布嗜血野人的岛屿附近时，都会发生沉船事件。从这些激动人心的冒险经历来判断，他身上的有些部位被烤过，而且经常受损伤，还有十五次或二十次被剥下头皮。

“那就是他头发稀疏的原因，”方特勒罗伊勋爵向他妈妈解释道，“在你的头皮被几次揭掉后，头发就不会再长了。帕罗马查外金国王用沃扑斯勒马穆普基酋长的头盖骨做了一把刀，上次，国王就是用这把刀剥掉了杰丽的头皮，打那以后他的头发就没有长过。杰丽说，那是他所经历过的最危险的时刻之一。当那国王挥舞着刀的时候，他太害怕了，以至于连头发都直直地竖立起来了，而且似乎永远不会再恢复过来了，看起来就好像是一把毛刷。我以前从来没有听说过杰丽那样的经历！我真想把这些故事告诉霍布斯先生！”

有时候，天气很糟糕，人们被困在甲板下的大厅里，塞德里克那帮成年朋友就会劝他讲述杰丽的“经历”。在他坐在那儿非常高兴而热情地讲述时，在任何横渡大西洋的轮船上，都不会有比小方特勒罗伊伯爵更加受人欢迎的游客了。他总是天真无邪，乐意尽力而为，使大家更加快乐。作为孩子，他感觉不到自己的重要性，而这恰恰给他增添了魅力。

“他们对杰丽的故事非常感兴趣，”他对他妈妈说，“那是因为我的缘故——你必须原谅我，最最亲爱的——但是有时候，我应该想到，如果这些故事不是发生在杰丽身上的话，它们不可能都是真的——嗯，这很奇怪。你知道，也许有时候他可能有所遗忘或是有些地方弄错了，因为他曾经常被剥掉头皮，一个人的头皮这么多次被剥掉过，不忘事才怪呢。”

在他跟他的好朋友迪克说再见后的第十一天，他到达了利物浦，和他母亲还有哈维沙姆先生一起到车站去乘车；第十二天晚上，马车停在了罗奇苑门口。在黑暗中，他们看不清房子。塞德里克只看见伞盖形的大树下有一条车道，马车在车道上往前行了一小段距离之后，塞德里克看见一扇开着的门，一束明亮的光线从中射出。

为了照顾女主人，玛丽也来了。她在他们之前到达了这所房子。当塞德里克跳下马车时，他看见两三个仆人站在宽敞明亮的大厅里，而玛丽就站在门口。

方特勒罗伊勋爵高兴地小声叫着，向她奔去。

“你也来这儿了，玛丽？”他说，“玛丽在这儿，最最亲爱的。”他吻着玛丽那粗糙的红脸颊。

“你在这儿，我很高兴，玛丽。”埃罗尔夫人轻声地对玛丽说，“见到你真让我感到安慰。你带走了我在这儿的陌生感。”随后她伸出她的小手，玛丽鼓起勇气，将它紧紧地握住。她知道，对于这位小母亲来说，这种“陌生感”该是多么难受啊，她离开了自己的故土，还要放弃自己的孩子！

英国仆人们古怪地看着小男孩和他的母亲。他们已经听到了关于他们俩的各种各样的流言。他们知道老伯爵曾经多么愤怒，也知道为什么埃罗尔夫人将住在罗奇苑，而她的小男孩将住在城堡里。他们还知道孩子将要继承大宗财产，以及他的残忍的老祖父及其痛风和坏脾气。

“他将来的日子不会好过，可怜的小家伙。”仆人们互相说道。

但是他们不知道，那来到他们中间的，是一个什么样的小勋爵，他们不太了解这未来的多林考特伯爵的性格特点。

塞德里克脱掉了外衣，就好像他习惯于自己料理自己似的。他开始环顾大厅，环顾四周，观察装饰大厅的挂画、鹿角和其他古怪的东西。在他看来，这些东西之所以看起来古怪，是因为他以前在私人家里从未见到过。

“最最亲爱的，”他说，“这房子真漂亮，不是吗？我很高兴你将住在这里。这房子相当大。”

跟纽约破旧街道上的那所房子相比，这所房子确实很大，而且很漂亮、舒适。玛丽把他们领上楼，卧室的壁炉里烧着火，房间很明亮，挂着印花布帘子，白色的炉前地毯是用动物皮毛做的，上面肆意地躺着一只雪白的大波斯猫。

“夫人，这只猫是城堡里的女管家送给您的，”玛丽解释道，“她是一位非常好心的女士，她亲自为您准备好了一切。我也是几分钟前才见到她，她很喜欢上尉，为他感到难过。她说，让一只大猫睡在地毯上，可以给您的房间营造出一种如在家里的气氛。埃罗尔上尉还是一个小男孩的时候，她就认识他了——她说他是一个英俊的好男孩，一个非常好的年轻人，喜欢跟上上下下每一个人说些让人高兴的话。”

当他们将一切准备妥当后，走下了楼梯，进入另一间宽敞明亮的房间。天花板很低。家具看起来都很重，雕刻得很精美。扶手椅很深，有着高大的靠背。房间里还有些奇怪的架子和柜子，装饰怪异而漂亮。壁炉前面铺着一块很大的虎皮，两面各有一张扶手椅。那只白猫本来静静地躺着，方特勒罗伊勋爵摸了它一下，它就跟着他下楼了。当他自己躺倒在地毯上时，它靠在他身边，将自己蜷缩起来，好像有意要跟他交个朋友。塞德里克高兴极了，他把自己的头跟它的放在一起，一边躺着一边抚摩着它，全然没注意到母亲和哈维沙姆先生的谈话。

事实上，他们说话的声音相当轻。埃罗尔夫人看上去脸色有点苍白，而且似乎是被激恼了。

“今晚他不需要走吧？”她说，“今晚他可以跟我待在一起吧？”

“是的，”哈维沙姆先生同样低声答道，“今晚他不必去。我自己吃完饭就去城堡，告诉老伯爵我们已经到了。”

埃罗尔夫人低头看着塞德里克。他躺在那张黄黑色的虎皮上，仪态优雅而无忧无虑。炉火照着他漂亮的红扑扑的小脸蛋，也照着他蓬乱的鬈发，那头发披散在地毯上；大猫满足地咕噜咕噜叫着，仿佛是在睡梦之中——就好像它喜欢那友善的小手充满爱心地抚摩着自己的皮毛。

埃罗尔夫人微笑着。

“老伯爵不会完全明白，他正在夺走我的是什么。”她相当悲伤地说。然后她看着律师。“如果你愿意的话，请你告诉他，”她说，“我宁愿不要那笔钱。”

“那笔钱！”哈维沙姆先生叫了起来，“你大概不是指他提出来要给你的那笔收入吧？”

“是的。”她十分简洁地答道，“我想我还是不要的好。但我不得不接受这房子，因为这房子能使我靠近我的孩子，为此我谢谢他。但是我自己有一点钱——足够我过简单的生活——我不愿拿他的钱，因为他是如此地不喜欢我。我有时会觉得，我是把塞德里克卖给他了。我同意放他走只是因为我太爱他了，为了他美好的未来我可以做出牺牲，因为他父亲会希望我这么做。”

哈维沙姆先生摸了摸下巴。

“这要求太奇怪了，”他说，“老伯爵听了会勃然大怒，不会理解你的。”

“我认为，如果他多想一想，他会理解的，”她说，“我不是真的需要钱，他如此恨我，以致夺走了我的孩子——他儿子的孩子，我干吗要接受他丰厚的赏赐？”

哈维沙姆先生看上去像是沉思了一会儿。

“我会传达你的意思的。”随后他说。

接着晚饭上来了，他们一起入座。大猫挨着塞德里克，坐在一把椅子上，整个吃饭期间，它一直威严地呜呜叫着。

那天晚上晚些时候，当哈维沙姆先生一出现在城堡，就被带去见老伯爵。他看见老伯爵坐在壁炉边一把豪华的安乐椅里。老伯爵看着律师，粗眉下的眼睛闪着尖锐的目光。哈维沙姆先生能看得出来，尽管他假装镇定，但内心里有点紧张，而且还很激动。

“嗯，”老伯爵说，“嗯，哈维沙姆，你回来了，是吗？情况怎么样？”

“小方特勒罗伊勋爵和他母亲已经在罗奇苑了，”哈维沙姆先生答道，“他们一路上非常顺利，现在身体很好。”

老伯爵发出了一声似乎是不耐烦的声音，不停地摇着手。

“听到你这么说，我很高兴。”他粗鲁地说，“就这样吧，很好。你自己该舒服舒服了，喝杯酒，休息吧。还有事吗？”

“今晚小勋爵仍然跟他母亲待在一起。明天我会把他带到城堡来的。”

老伯爵的胳膊肘搁在椅子的扶手上，他抬起手，遮住自己的眼睛。

“噢？”他说，“你就继续说吧。你知道，我跟你说过，不要写信来告诉我这事，所以我对这事一无所知。他是一个什么样的孩子？我不管他母亲如何。他是一个什么样的孩子？”

哈维沙姆先生自己给自己倒了杯葡萄酒，喝了一点儿。然后坐下来，手里捧着酒杯。

“要对一个七岁的孩子的性格做出判断，是很困难的。”他谨慎地说。

老伯爵非常傲慢。他迅速地抬了抬头，吐出了一句粗暴的话。

“一个傻子，是吗？”他大声说，“还是一个不懂事的小家伙？就因为他的美国血统，是吗？”

“我觉得美国血统对他没什么伤害，老爷。”律师以他一贯沙哑而谨慎的语调答道，“我对孩子了解不多，但我想他是个相当好的孩子。”

他说话的神态一向非常深思熟虑，有气无力，但这回比平常更加婆婆妈妈。他有个精明的想法，即让老伯爵在没有任何准备的情况下，跟他的孙子第一次见面，让老伯爵自己去判断，会更好一些。

“很健康，而且长得很好，是吗？”老伯爵问道。

“一看就知道非常健康，长得很好。”律师答道。

“四肢挺拔，看上去很入眼，是吗？”老伯爵问道。

一丝微笑掠过哈维沙姆先生薄薄的嘴唇。在他的眼前浮现出在罗奇苑看到的那个画面——孩子的身体漂亮而优雅，无忧无虑地躺在虎皮上——明亮而蓬乱的头发披散在地毯上——还有那生气勃勃的、玫瑰般的脸庞。

“作为男孩子，我想，他长得可真俊，老爷。”哈维沙姆先生说，“尽管也许我的话不是定论，但是你会发现他跟大多数英国孩子有些不同，我敢这么说。”

“我一点儿都不怀疑你的话。”老伯爵咆哮着说，他感到了痛风引起的一阵剧痛，“许多冒失的小乞丐，那些美国孩子，我已听说得太多。”

“他一点儿都不冒失。”哈维沙姆先生说，“我很难描述他跟其他孩子的差异。他更多地和年龄大的人们在一起，而不是同龄的孩子。那种差异似乎是成熟和童稚的结合。”

“美国人的冒失！”老伯爵不同意他的话，“我以前就听说过，他们管这叫作早熟和自由。野蛮的、冒失的、糟糕的举止，就是那么回事！”

哈维沙姆先生又喝了一点儿葡萄酒，他极少跟供养自己的老伯爵争辩——尤其是当老伯爵那高贵的腿被痛风折磨时，他绝对不会争辩。在那样的时刻，最好是让老伯爵一个人待着，所以两人都沉默了一阵。还是哈维沙姆先生打破了沉默。

“埃罗尔夫人要我向您转达一句话。”他说。

“我不想听她的任何话！”老伯爵呻吟着说，“越少听到她越好。”

“这话相当重要，”律师解释道，“她宁愿不要您提出拨给她的钱。”

老伯爵很明显感到了惊讶。

“什么？”他喊道，“什么？”

哈维沙姆先生把刚才的话重复了一遍。

“她说这没必要，还说，那是因为你们俩的关系不好——”

“关系不好！”老伯爵粗野地从牙缝里吐出这几个词，“我该说他们那些人都不讲情谊！想到她，我就感到厌恶！一个唯利是图的、尖声尖气的美国人！我不希望见到她！”

“老爷，”哈维沙姆先生说，“您可不能说她唯利是图，她没要求任何东西，她甚至没接受您给她的钱。”

“别有用心！”高贵的老伯爵厉声说，“她想哄骗我接见她。她以为我会欣赏她的精神。我才不欣赏呢！只是美国式的独立！我不想让她在我的庄园门口像个乞丐似的生活。因为她是孩子的母亲，所以她有一个要保持的地位，而且她会保持的。不管她喜欢还是不喜欢，她都得接受那笔钱！”

“她不会花那笔钱的。”哈维沙姆先生说。

“她花还是不花，我不在乎！”老伯爵蛮横地说，“我会派人把钱送给她的。我不能让她跟人说，她不得不生活得像个乞丐，只是因为我没有为她做任何事！她想让孩子对我有个坏的看法！我猜想她已经毒害了他的心灵，并以此来对付我！”

“不是这样的。”哈维沙姆先生说，“我还要转达另一句话，向您证明她并没有那么做。”

“我不想听！”老伯爵气喘吁吁地说，由于气愤、激动和痛风，他已经上气不接下气。

但是哈维沙姆先生还是说了。

“您因为看不起她，而将他们母子俩拆开，她要求您别跟方特勒罗伊勋爵谈起有关的事，免得他知道真相。他很爱她，她相信那样会在您和孩子之间造成障碍，她说他不会理解这事，所以可能会使他在某种程度上害怕您，或者至少会使他对您感觉不亲热。她已经告诉过他，他还太小，不能理解其中的原因，不过，等他长大一些，她会告诉他事实的真相。她希望你们俩初次见面，不要有什么阴影。”

老伯爵往后沉入扶手椅，他那双深陷的老眼露出凶相，在浓密的眉毛下闪着微光。

“得啦，得啦！”他说，依然上气不接下气，“得啦，得啦！难道你的意思是说，她还没有告诉他真相？”

“一个字都没有，老爷，”律师冷冷地答道，“我可以向您保证，他他母亲什么也没对他说——绝对没说，所以那孩子不会对您的完美产生丝毫的怀疑，他乐意相信，您是所有祖父中最可亲、可爱的。还在纽约时，当我详细地执行您的命令时，他把您看成慷慨大度的人。”

“他是这么看的吗，嗯？”老伯爵问道。

哈维沙姆先生说：“方特勒罗伊勋爵对您的印象如何将完全取决于您自己。如果您能原谅我，允许我自由地给您提建议，那么我认为，如果您小心谨慎，别用轻蔑的口气说他母亲，那样您才会跟他处得更好。”

“呸，呸！”老伯爵说，“那孩子才七岁呢！”

“那七年他一直待在母亲身边，”哈维沙姆先生又说，“她拥有着他全部的爱意。”





第五章　在城堡里


下午晚些时候，小方特勒罗伊勋爵和哈维沙姆先生的马车沿着通往城堡的长长的林荫道行驶。老伯爵已发出命令，他孙子必须及时到达，以跟他共进晚餐，个中原因只有他自己最清楚。他还发出命令，说他将待在接待室里，孩子必须单独被送去那儿。当马车行驶在路上时，方特勒罗伊伯爵坐在车里，舒服地斜靠着考究的靠背，以极大的兴趣憧憬着未来。实际上，他对所见的一切都感兴趣，如他对马车就很感兴趣，那马高大而雄伟，马具闪闪发光。他对高个子车夫和脚夫也感兴趣，他们都穿着华丽的号衣。他尤其感兴趣的，是车厢板壁上的冠冕图案。他与脚夫搭起讪来，目的是要询问那冠冕的含义。

当马车到达庭院的大门时，塞德里克透过车窗往外看，以更好地看清那装饰在门口的巨大石狮。从一间覆盖着常春藤的小屋里，一个慈祥的、脸颊红润的女人走了出来，打开了大门。两个孩子从房门中冲了出来，他们站在门口，眼睛瞪得大大的、圆圆的，看着马车里的塞德里克，塞德里克也看着他们。他们的母亲站着，微笑着行屈膝礼，那两个孩子也迅速地微微地行了屈膝礼。

“她认识我吗？”方特勒罗伊勋爵问道，“我想，她肯定以为她认识我。”然后他对着她，脱掉黑色的绒帽，微笑着行了脱帽礼。

“你好吗？”他快乐地说，“下午好！”

那女人看起来很高兴，他想。笑容展开在她红润的脸上，蓝色的眼睛闪着友好的目光。

“上帝保佑你，少爷！”她说，“上帝保佑你漂亮的脸蛋！祝你好运，祝你快乐，少爷！欢迎你！”

当马车驶过她身边时。方特勒罗伊勋爵再一次挥舞帽子，向她点头。

“我喜欢那个女人。”他说，“她看上去很喜欢孩子。我会喜欢到这儿来，跟她的孩子一块儿玩。”

哈维沙姆先生没有告诉他，伯爵是不会允许他跟看门人家的孩子一起玩的。律师想，有的是时间来告诉他这一点。

马车继续往前走啊走，道路两旁是高大的、美丽的树木，长长的枝丫摇曳着，伸向路的对面，在路的上方形成一个拱形的盖。塞德里克从来没有见过这样的树木，它们是如此高大挺拔，巨大的树干上的枝丫长得如此低。那时他还不知道，多林考特城堡是全英国最美丽的庄园之一，其园林也是最大、最好的之一，树木和道路也罕有其匹。他发现庄园无处不美。他喜欢大树及其粗壮的枝丫，傍晚时分金色的夕阳从树隙间洒落下来，照在他们的身上。他喜欢万物的寂静。他浏览着园林的美景，感到一种奇怪的巨大的快乐。在那摇摆着的树枝之下、树枝之间——是园林中最大、最美的地方。林中还有些别的树木，有的挺拔地独自站着，有的成群结队。他们时不时地走过一丛丛高大的蕨类植物。蓝色的风铃草在柔风中婆娑起舞，地面一次次被染成蔚蓝。他几次高兴地笑着，跳了起来，就像一只兔子从绿草丛中跳出来，身后白色的短尾巴一闪一甩，一溜烟地跑开了。有一回，一群鹧鸪突然纷乱地飞起来，旋即飞走了。塞德里克叫喊着，拍着手。

“这地方很美，是吗？”他对哈维沙姆先生说，“我从未见过这么美丽的地方，甚至比纽约的中央公园还要美。”

由于路上时间长，他都有点搞不清哪是哪了。

“从园子的大门到城堡的前门，”最后他说，“到底有多远？”

“有三四英里吧。”律师答道。

“住的地方离大门真远啊。”塞德里克感慨道。

每隔几分钟，他就能看见一些新鲜事物，他欣赏着，感到很奇妙。他见到了鹿，有些蹲伏在草丛中，有些站立着，头上长着美丽的鹿角。它们的头转向道路，露出受到惊吓的神情，就好像是车轮声打扰了它们。塞德里克看得入迷了。

“这儿有马戏团？”他喊道，“或者它们一直在这儿生活？谁是它们的主人？”

“它们一直生活在这儿，”哈维沙姆先生告诉他，“它们属于老伯爵，你的祖父。”

不久，他们就看到了城堡。它耸立在他们面前，雄伟、美丽而古老。太阳最后的余晖照着众多的窗户。城堡有角楼、塔楼和雉堞，墙上生长着许多的常春藤。它周围所有开阔的空地都设计成了地坪、草坪和显眼的花圃。

“这是我所见过的最美的地方！”塞德里克说，他圆鼓鼓的脸上闪耀着快乐的光辉，“它使人想起王宫。我曾经在一本童话书中见过类似的图画。”

他看见大门被推开，好多仆人列成两排，站在那儿，看着他。他弄不明白，他们为什么要站在那儿，但同时很欣赏他们的号衣。他不知道，他们站在那儿是在向他表示敬意，因为有朝一日他将成为所有这一切美景的主人——壮丽的城堡像童话中的王宫、宏伟的庭院、高大的古树、长满小山谷的蕨类植物、风铃草丛中玩耍的家兔和野兔，长着斑纹的大眼鹿蹲伏在草丛深处。仅仅在两个星期前，他还跟霍布斯先生一起，坐在土豆和桃子罐头之间，他的双腿从那高凳子上垂下来。在这宏大的庄园里，他可以干很多事，但是要他此刻就意识到这一点，还很困难。在那仆人队伍的尽头，站着一个上了年纪的女人，她身穿一件华贵的素绉黑色长外衣，戴着一顶帽子，头发已经斑白。当塞德里克走进大厅时，她站得比其他人更近些，从她的目光中，他感到她有话要跟他说。哈维沙姆先生那时抓着他的手，停下了脚步。

“这就是方特勒罗伊勋爵，梅隆太太。”他说，“方特勒罗伊少爷，这位是梅隆太太，城堡的管家。”

塞德里克将手伸给她，她的眼睛一亮。“是你送猫来的吗？”他说，“谢谢你，夫人。”

跟门卫的太太一样，梅隆太太也很高兴，她那标致的老脸上露出了笑容。

“我应该认出少爷来的，”她对哈维沙姆先生说，“他的脸型和言行跟上尉一样。今儿个真是个好日子，先生。”

塞德里克想不明白，为什么今天是个好日子。他好奇地看着梅隆太太。刹那间，他似乎在她眼中看见了泪水，但是她明明非常高兴。她低头对哈维沙姆先生微笑着。

“那猫在这儿留下了两只漂亮的小猫，”她说，“它们将被送到你那儿，由你来抚养。”

哈维沙姆先生低声跟她说了几句话。

“在书房里，先生，”梅隆太太答道，“要把勋爵单独领到那儿去。”

几分钟后，那穿着号衣的高个子仆人，将塞德里克护送到了书房门口，打开门，禀告道：“方特勒罗伊勋爵来了，老爷。”他的说话声相当庄严。他把塞德里克领到了老伯爵眼前。因为他只是一个仆人，所以他觉得，小勋爵回来继承属于他的土地和财产，继承老伯爵的地位和头衔，这是一件大事。

塞德里克跨过门槛，走进房间。房间很大、很豪华，里面有精雕细刻的大件家具，还有一架架的书籍。由于家具的颜色很暗，布帘子很沉重，嵌有钻石的窗户颜色也很深，所以从房间的一头到另一头似乎距离很遥远。太阳落山了，一切都暗沉沉的。一开始塞德里克还以为房间里没人，但马上他就发现，宽大的壁炉中火烧得正旺，在炉火边有一张大安乐椅，椅子里坐着一个人——那人起先没有转身看他们。

但是至少他已注意到了房间的一角，椅子旁的地板上躺着一只狗。那是一只茶色的猛犬，身子和四肢几乎有狮子那么大。大狗威严而缓慢地站起来，步态沉重地走向小家伙。

这时那椅子中的人开口说话了：“杜格尔，”他喊道，“回来。”

不过，小方特勒罗伊勋爵心中既没有感到害怕，也没有感到恶意——他从来都是个勇敢的小家伙。他以世界上最最自然的方式，将手放在大狗的项圈上，然后他跟狗一起向前迈步，狗一边走着，一边喷着鼻息。

随后，老伯爵抬起了头。塞德里克看到的是一个高大的老人：粗浓蓬松的头发和眉毛全白了；深陷的双眼间长着一个鹰钩鼻。老伯爵看见的，是一个孩子优雅的身影。如果说城堡像童话中的王宫的话，我们必须承认，小方特勒罗伊勋爵自己就是一个可爱的王子的小小翻版，也许就是一个强健的小王子的典型，尽管他自己对此还一点都没有感知。但是，当老伯爵发现他的孙子是一个非常漂亮健康的男孩子时，他不假思索地站了起来。他把手放在大狗的脖子上，抬起了头，在他那颗暴躁的年老的心中，突然升起一股胜利和得意的热情。无论是对他还是对狗，孩子都没有表现出羞怯或害怕，这使这个阴郁的老贵族很高兴。

塞德里克看着他，就像看着仆人住房里的那个女人和那个女管家。他径直走到老伯爵跟前。

“您就是伯爵老爷？”他说，“我是您的孙子，您知道的，是哈维沙姆先生带我来的，我是方特勒罗伊勋爵。”

他伸出了手，想跟伯爵握手。这是很礼貌、很正当的。“希望您身体棒棒的。”他最大可能地显示出友好的姿态，接着说，“见到您很高兴。”

老伯爵握了握他的手，眼中闪着奇异的目光，开始时他大受震惊，几乎不知道该说什么。在他那粗重的眉毛下，双眼紧盯着眼前这如画的小精灵，从头到脚打量着他。

“你见到我很高兴，是吗？”他说。

“是的，”方特勒罗伊勋爵答道，“很高兴。”

老伯爵身边有一把椅子，塞德里克坐在了上面。这是一把很高的靠背椅，当塞德里克坐定在里面时，他感到脚没有着地，但是他坐得很自然，专注而谦逊地注视着那位威严的亲人。

“我一直想知道您长得怎么样。”他说，“我躺在船上的铺位上时，就想您是否长得跟我父亲差不多。”

“差不多吗？”老伯爵问道。

“嗯，”塞德里克答道，“我很小的时候，父亲就去世了，我不能确切地记得他长得什么样了，但我想您跟他不一样。”

“我想，你是失望了。”他祖父暗示道。

“哦，没有！”塞德里克礼貌地答道，“您当然会喜欢别人长得跟您父亲相像；但是您当然也喜欢您祖父的模样，哪怕他不像您父亲。爱慕亲人是怎么一回事，您自己是知道的。”

老伯爵的身子靠在椅背上，眼睛盯着塞德里克。我们不能说，老伯爵自己知道爱慕亲人是怎么一回事。他把自己大部分高贵的闲暇时间都用来跟他们大吵大闹，使他们离开他的房子，还用辱骂性的话称呼他们。他们都打心眼里憎恶他。

“任何孩子都爱他的祖父，”方特勒罗伊勋爵继续说，“尤其是一个像您一样善待他的祖父。”

老伯爵的眼中闪过另一丝奇怪的目光。

“哦！”他说，“我对你很好，是吗？”

“是的，”方特勒罗伊勋爵高兴地答道，“在布里奇特、卖苹果的老奶奶、还有迪克那些人的事情上，我一直对您心存感激！”

“布里奇特！”老伯爵惊讶地喊道，“迪克和卖苹果的老太太！”

“是的，”塞德里克解释道，“为了他们，您把那笔钱都给了我——您告诉哈维沙姆先生说，如果我需要那笔钱，他就会给我。”

“哈！”老爷惊叫道，“是的，是的！那笔钱你喜欢怎么花就怎么花。你拿来买什么了？我倒是喜欢听听这事。”

他那粗重的双眉聚在一处，他以尖锐的目光看着孩子。

“哦！”方特勒罗伊勋爵说，“也许您不知道迪克、卖苹果的老奶奶和布里奇特。我忘了您住得离他们实在太远了。他们都是我特别好的朋友。要知道迈可尔得了热病——”

“迈可尔是谁？”老伯爵问道。

“迈可尔是布里奇特的丈夫，他们家很困难。男人生病了，不能工作，而且还有十二个孩子，你该知道情况怎么样。迈可尔一直是一个头脑冷静的人。布里奇特经常到我们家来，一来就哭个不停。哈维沙姆先生来的那天晚上，她正在厨房里哭，因为他们家几乎揭不开锅了，而且连房租都付不起了。我到厨房里去看她，哈维沙姆先生派人去把我叫到客厅里，说您让他带了一笔钱给我。于是我尽快地跑到厨房，把钱给了她。这下就把事情解决了，布里奇特几乎不敢相信自己的眼睛。那就是我要感谢您的原因。”

“哦！”老伯爵声音低沉地说，“那就是你为自己做的一件事儿？还有呢？”

杜格尔一直坐在高背椅子旁。自从塞德里克坐下时，它就待在那儿了。有几次它转过身，抬头看看塞德里克，好像它对谈话很有兴趣似的。杜格尔是一条很严肃的狗，似乎觉得自己长得太大了，不能对生活轻松地做出反应。老伯爵深知狗的习性，他一直怀着一种秘密的兴趣看着它。杜格尔没有一般狗的习性，不会为跟人结识而冲上冲下。老伯爵有点儿弄不明白，这猛犬怎么会在那孩子的抚触下，安静地坐着。正在这时，那狗又庄严地细看了一眼小方特勒罗伊勋爵，并且小心地将它那巨大的狮子头枕在他的膝盖上。

塞德里克一边回答，一边继续抚摸着这新朋友。

“嗯，还有迪克，”他说，“您会喜欢迪克的，他非常大方。”

这是美国式的说法，老伯爵闻所未闻。

“这话是什么意思？”他问道。

方特勒罗伊勋爵停下来想了一会儿。这到底什么意思，他自己也没有太大的把握。他误以为，那话的意思是某种高度可信的东西，因为迪克一直喜欢这么说。

“我觉得，这话的意思是，他不会欺骗任何人。”他解释道，“也不会打一个个头比他小的孩子。他给人擦皮鞋，擦得很好，尽可能擦得亮光光的。他是个专业的擦皮鞋匠。”

“他是你的一个熟人，是吗？”老伯爵说。

“他是我的一个老朋友。”他的孙子答道，“虽然没有跟霍布斯先生那样老的交情，但也相当年久了。就在轮船起航的前一刻，他还送了我一件礼物。”

他把手伸进衣兜，拿出一件折叠得整整齐齐的红色东西，把它打开，神态可爱而骄傲。这就是那块红色的丝帕，上面装饰着紫色的马掌、马头。

“他给了我这个。”小勋爵说，“我要永久地保存它。您可以把它围在脖子上，也可以放在衣兜里。我用钱帮他支走了杰克，还给他买了新鞋刷。他用那之后挣的第一笔钱买了这手帕。这是一件纪念品。我在给霍布斯先生的手表里写了两句诗：‘当你看见这东西时，请记起我。’现在每当我看见这手帕，我就会想起迪克。”

这话在尊敬的多林考特伯爵的心里引发了莫大的触动，这是难以描述的。他不是一个容易被打动的老贵族，因为他见过很多世面。但他发现孙子身上有种非常新奇的东西，几乎带走了他高贵的呼吸，使他产生了某种奇异的情绪。他从未关心过孩子；他是如此忙于自己寻欢作乐，以致没有时间来关心孩子们。尽管有时候，他记起，自己曾经认为，塞德里克的父亲是一个漂亮而健壮的小家伙，但是他的儿子们还在很小的时候，就对他没什么兴趣了。他一向自私，以致看不到别人的不自私，为此他失去了许多快乐。他一直不知道，一个心地善良的孩子可以多么温和、守信、可爱，其本质可以多么天真无邪、简朴大方。对他来说，男孩子若不严加管教，总好像是一头极其讨厌的、自私的、贪婪的、闹腾的小动物。他自己的两个大儿子就曾给他们的家庭教师带来无穷无尽的麻烦和烦恼。至于那最小的一个，他倒是没听人抱怨过，但那只是因为那孩子在家中无足轻重。他内心里从来没有出现过这样的念头，即要喜欢他的孙子。他之所以派人将小塞德里克带来，是因为他的傲慢促使他这么做的。如果这男孩将来要继承他的地位，那么他不希望，由于自己的继承者是一个没受过教育的乡下孩子而使自己被人笑话。他相信，这孩子如果在美国长大，将成为一个小丑似的家伙。他对这孩子没有一点爱意。他唯一的希望是，发现这孩子的优点，让人能对他产生一些好感。他对两个大儿子如此失望，又被埃罗尔上尉的美国婚姻弄得十分恼怒。他一直认为，那场美国婚姻中没有什么可以信赖的东西。当仆人向他报告说方特勒罗伊勋爵到了的时候，他几乎害怕看见那男孩，以免发现他长得完全像他所担心的样子。正因为如此，他命令仆人将孩子单独带来见他。如果他对孩子失望的话，他的傲慢使他无法容忍别人看见他的失望。当孩子走上前来，神态优雅而安详，而且用手无所畏惧地抚摩大狗的脖子时，他那傲慢、僵化而衰老的心在胸膛中猛然跳了一下。甚至于在他最好的希望中，他也没有想到过自己的孙子会长得那么好看。他本来害怕看见的孩子实在太美好了，以至于几乎让人难以相信这是真的——他是如此讨厌孩子的母亲——而这小家伙是如此的漂亮、勇敢、优雅，如此的孩子气！老伯爵坚定的镇静心理被这惊讶震动了。

随后他们开始了谈话。老伯爵被感动了，他感到更加奇怪了，而且越来越迷惑不解。首先，他太习惯于看见人们在他面前既害怕又尴尬，他本来也预料他的孙子会惧怕、羞怯。但是塞德里克像不害怕杜格尔似的，也不怕老伯爵。他不是勇敢，他只是单纯、友善，他意识不到有什么理由使他难堪或害怕。老伯爵不知不觉地发现，小男孩把他当成了朋友，待他像朋友似的，一点都不怀疑他。这是很明显的，因为小家伙坐在那高高的椅子里，友好地谈着话，从来没有想过，眼前这位高大而凶神恶煞的老人会对他不好，相反，他很高兴地看着老人。同样明显的是，作为一个孩子，他希望能使祖父高兴并对自己感兴趣。尽管老伯爵横行霸道、铁石心肠、非常世故，但在孩子对他的这份信任中，他情不自禁地感到了隐秘而新鲜的快乐。总而言之，他跟塞德里克在一起，没有感到不和谐，因为塞德里克没有不信任他，也没有在他面前畏缩，或者试探他本性中丑陋的部分，而是以清澈、无疑的眼光看着他。

于是，老人将身子靠在椅背上，让那年幼的交谈者更多地谈论自己。小家伙谈话时，他用奇异的目光看着小家伙。方特勒罗伊勋爵很乐意回答他所有的提问，以一个孩子单纯的方式继续闲聊着，相当镇静。他一五一十地告诉老人，关于迪克的事，关于杰克的事，关于卖苹果的老奶奶的事，还有关于霍布斯先生的事。他描述了共和党辉煌的游行，以及旗帜、幻灯片、火炬和烟火。在谈话中，他谈到了七月四日和独立战争，热情正待高涨起来，他突然想起了什么，戛然停住了。

“怎么了？”他祖父问道，“为什么不继续说？”

方特勒罗伊勋爵不安地在椅子里挪了挪身子。老伯爵明白，方特勒罗伊勋爵为突然袭上心头的念头而感到十分尴尬。

“我只是在想，您也许不喜欢独立战争，”他答道，“也许您的某个手下也曾去过那儿，我忘了您是一个英国人。”

“你可以继续说。”老伯爵说道，“我的手下从来没有去过那儿，你忘了你也是一个英国人哪。”

“哦！不是的，”塞德里克急忙说，“我是一个美国人！”

“你是一个英国人。”老伯爵严肃地说，“你父亲是英国人。”

他说这话使他自己高兴了一阵，但这话使塞德里克感到不高兴。

“我生在美国，”他反驳道，“如果您生在美国，您也是美国人。请原谅我跟您顶嘴。”他那严肃的语调又礼貌、又灵巧，“霍布斯先生告诉我，如果美国和英国再次开战，您知道，我得——得站在美国一边。”

老伯爵狞厉地似笑非笑着——笑得短暂而狞厉，但毕竟是笑。

“你要站在美国一边，是吗？”他说。

他讨厌美国和美国人，不过，使他感到高兴的是，这小爱国志士看上去是多么严肃而有趣。他想，这么好的一个美国孩子，长大后可能是一个相当优秀的英国人。

他们没有时间深入地谈论独立战争——事实上，方特勒罗伊勋爵感到，在接到吃晚饭的通知之前，如果再回到这个话题是挺美妙的。

塞德里克离开椅子，挨近他那高贵的亲人，低头看着老伯爵患痛风的脚。

“要我帮帮您吗？”他礼貌地说，“您瞧，您可以靠着我。有一回，霍布斯先生的脚被一只土豆桶给轧伤了，他就靠着我走路。”

那高大的仆人禁不住笑了，几乎把他的名声和身份置于危险之中。他是一个贵族家的仆人，一直生活在最好的贵族家庭里。他从来不笑，实际上，如果他允许自己被环境所牵引，从而做出诸如微笑这类有失检点的言行，他会觉得自己丢了面子，庸俗不堪。但这回他实在控制不住自己，只好将目光越过老伯爵的脑袋，直直地盯着一幅非常丑陋的画，为自己解围。

老伯爵从头到脚看着他年幼而英勇的孙子。

“你觉得你能让我靠着？”他粗暴地问道。

“我想我行，”塞德里克说，“我很健壮的，我已经七岁了。您瞧，您可以一边靠着您的手杖，另一边靠着我。迪克说，对于一个仅仅七岁的男孩来说，我的肌肉够发达的了。”

他握紧拳头，往上举到跟肩膀齐平，以便老伯爵能看见他的肌肉，迪克对它可是大加赞扬的。而且他一脸严肃认真，以至于那仆人感到，得费点劲才能目不斜视地看那幅难看的画。

“好了，”老伯爵说，“你可以试一试。”

塞德里克递给他手杖，然后开始帮他站起来。通常都是仆人干这活儿，当老爷的痛风病格外疼痛时，仆人会被骂个狗血喷头。一般来说，老伯爵不是一个讲礼貌的人，有许多次，他身边的仆人们在他们体面的号衣下哆嗦。

不过这天晚上，尽管那患痛风病的脚使老伯爵剧痛了好几回，但他没有骂人。他决定试验一下。他慢慢地站起来，把手放在塞德里克的小肩膀上。塞德里克用肩膀支撑他，这需要多么大的勇气啊。他小心地往前跨了一步，低头看着老伯爵那痛风的脚。

“您尽管靠着我吧，”他兴奋地说，表现出勇敢的样子，“我会慢慢走的。”

如果支撑老伯爵的是一个仆人，他会把自身重量的大部分放在帮手的胳膊上，而不是放在手杖上。而他的试验内容的一部分，就是要让他的孙子感觉到他的体重一点都不轻。事实上，他相当重。走了几步后，小勋爵的脸开始发热了，心跳也加快了，但是他坚定地激励着自己，记起他的肌肉是迪克曾经赞扬过的。

“别怕，您尽管靠着我，”塞德里克气喘吁吁地说，“如果——如果路不很远的话——我没事儿。”

到餐厅的路确实不太远，但是在他们到达餐桌一头的椅子时，塞德里克似乎走过了一段漫长的路程。似乎每走一步，那放在他肩膀上的手就会增重几分。他的脸变得越来越红，越来越热，他的呼吸则变得越来越急促，但是他从未想过放弃。他绷紧全身的肌肉，直直地抬着头，一边蹒跚前行，一边鼓励老伯爵。

“当您站立时，您的脚很疼吗？”他问道，“您曾试过把它泡在热水和芥末中吗？霍布斯先生常常把他的脚放在热水中。他们告诉我，山金车花是一种很好的草药。”

杜格尔慢悠悠地在他们身边踱步，那高大的仆人则跟在后面。有几次，当他看着那小男孩几乎使出了全部的力气，以那样强的意志力支撑着沉重的负担，他感到非常惊讶。有一回，当老伯爵低下头，侧过脸，看见那涨得通红的小脸蛋时，也显得相当惊讶。

当他们走入用饭的房间时，塞德里克发现房间很宽大、很庄严，饭桌一头的椅子后面站着仆人，他一见他们就死劲盯着看。

但是他们最终来到了椅子旁。老伯爵将手从塞德里克的肩膀上拿开，并且稳稳地坐下了。

塞德里克拿出迪克送的手帕，擦了擦额头。

“今晚很暖和，是吗？”他说，“也许您需要火——因为您的脚需要烤烤火，不过对于我来说，这天似乎有点暖和了。”

“你干了件相当劳累的活儿。”老伯爵说。

“哦，哦！”方特勒罗伊勋爵说，“这一点儿也不累，只不过我有点热，一个人在夏天是很容易热起来的。”

他用那华丽的手帕使劲擦着汗湿的鬈发，他的椅子放在桌子的另一头，跟他祖父相隔着。这是一把扶手椅，是为比他大得多的人准备的。实际上，他到现在所见过的一切——宽大的房间、高高的天花板、大号的家具、高大的仆人、大狗，还有老伯爵自己——看着所有这些人和物，小家伙感到，自己确实非常小。不过，这并不使他感到烦恼，他从未想过自己很高大、很重要，而且他很愿意让自己去适应超越于他的环境。

塞德里克坐在饭桌的另一头，身子埋在大椅子里，也许他从来没有显得像现在这样小过。尽管老伯爵处境孤独，但他还是决定要体面地生活。他很喜欢用餐，吃的动作很正规。塞德里克的目光穿过精致的玻璃杯和碟子，看着老伯爵，他的眼睛还没有习惯这些餐具的光亮，似乎有点眩晕了。宽大庄严的房间、穿着号衣的高大仆人、明亮的灯盏、闪闪发光的银器和玻璃杯，餐桌一头是那看着很凶恶的老贵族，另一头是这小小的男孩子，这一幕要让一个陌生人看到了，他肯定会开心地笑起来的。老伯爵通常将吃饭看作一件非常严肃的事——如果老爷在饭桌上不高兴，或者提不起胃口，厨师就会认为这是十分严重的事件。但是，今天他的胃口似乎比平常要好得多，也许是因为除了小菜的味道和肉汁的做法外，他还想到了一些别的，那是他的孙子所带来的。他的目光不断地越过桌子，看着塞德里克。他自己说得不太多，但是他成功地使男孩说啊说。他从未曾想过自己会从听一个孩子的谈话中得到乐趣，但是方特勒罗伊勋爵一下子就把他迷住了，并且让他高兴不已。他一直在想，只是为了考验塞德里克到底有多大的勇气和忍耐力，他才让那稚嫩的肩膀承受自己的体重。结果他知道，他的孙子一点都没有感到恐惧，从未想过要放弃他所承担的责任。这使他很高兴。

“您不是一直戴着您的爵士帽吧？”方特勒罗伊勋爵尊敬地问道。

“不是的，”老伯爵狞笑着答道，“这还没有成为我的习惯。”

“霍布斯先生说您总是戴着爵士帽，”塞德里克说，“但是他仔细想了一阵后，说他猜想您有时候也得把它摘下来，戴上普通的帽子。”

“是的，”老伯爵说，“有时候我也把它摘下来。”

一个仆人突然转过身去，用手捂着嘴，轻轻地咳嗽了一下。

塞德里克先吃完饭，他靠着椅背，开始全面地打量房间。

“您肯定为自己的房子感到很骄傲，”他说，“这房子真美。我从来没有见过比这更美的房子了。不过，当然啦，由于我才七岁，所以我的见闻还不多。”

“你认为我肯定为房子感到骄傲，是吗？”老伯爵说。

“我想，任何人都会为它感到骄傲的。如果这是我的房子，我也会感到骄傲的。它无处不美。园林、树木多美啊，更美的是那沙沙作响的叶子！”

然后他顿了顿，目光越过饭桌，好像在渴望什么。

“这房子里只住两个人，显得太大了，不是吗？”他说。

“两个人住是够大的了，”老伯爵答道，“你觉得太大了吗？”

小勋爵犹豫了一会儿。

“我只是在想，”他说，“如果两个人住在这里，但关系并不好，他们有时可能会感到孤独。”

“你觉得我会找到一个好伙伴吗？”老伯爵问道。

“是的，”塞德里克答道，“我觉得您会的。霍布斯先生和我是最要好的朋友，除了最最亲爱的之外，他是我最好的朋友。”

老伯爵那灌木般浓密的眉毛皱了一下。

“谁是最最亲爱的？”

“她是我母亲。”方特勒罗伊勋爵说，声音又低又小。

也许因为睡觉的时间快到了，他有点困了；也许因为经受了前些日子的激动，现在他自然就困了；也许那种疲乏的感觉还使他隐隐约约感到了孤独，尤其是当他想起，今晚他不能睡在家里，他“最好的朋友”也不会用爱怜的目光看着他了。塞德里克和他的母亲一直是最好的朋友，他禁不住想念她。他越想她，越不愿意再跟老伯爵聊天。饭快吃完的时候，老伯爵看到他脸上有一丝淡淡的阴影，但是塞德里克以极大的勇气稳住自己。当他们走回书房时，尽管高个仆人就走在老伯爵身边，老伯爵还是把手搭在了他孙子的肩膀上，不过已没有来的时候那么沉重了。

当仆人离开书房，房间里只剩下他们俩的时候，塞德里克在炉边地毯上，挨着杜格尔坐下。有一阵子，他静静地抚摩着狗的耳朵，看着炉火。

老伯爵看着他。塞德里克的眼睛看上去若有所思，有一两回他还轻轻地叹气。老伯爵静静地坐着，眼睛一直盯着孙子。

“方特勒罗伊，”最后他说，“你在想什么？”

方特勒罗伊勋爵抬起眼睛，像个男子汉似的笑着。

“我在想最最亲爱的。”他说。

他站起来，把手放进小衣兜里，开始来回走动。他的眼睛很亮，嘴唇紧紧抿着，但是他的头一直抬着，步子很坚定。大狗一边懒洋洋地动着，一边看着他，随后站了起来，走向孩子，开始不安地跟随他。方特勒罗伊勋爵把手从口袋里拿出来，放在大狗的脖子上。

“这狗很好，”他说，“它是我的朋友，它知道我的感受。”

“你感觉怎么样？”老伯爵问道。

这是小家伙第一次感受到想家的痛苦，他跟这种痛苦斗争着。伯爵一看，心里也感到很烦乱，不过，使他高兴的是，他看到塞德里克正在勇敢地努力把持着自己，他喜欢这种幼稚的勇敢。

“过来。”他说。

方特勒罗伊勋爵走了过去。

“我以前从来没有离开过自己的房子。”他说，褐色的眼中闪烁着犯愁的目光，“当一个人得整个晚上待在别人的城堡里，而不是自己的家里，会有一种很奇怪的感觉。不过，最最亲爱的离我并不远。她告诉我要记住这一点——而且——我已经七岁了——而且我可以看她给我的照片。”

他把手伸进口袋，从中拿出一个小盒子，紫罗兰色的盒子外边包着天鹅绒。

“就是这盒子。”他说，“您瞧，您只要按一下弹簧，它就会打开，她的照片就在里面。”

他靠近老伯爵的椅子。当他把小盒子呈给老人时，他倚靠在扶手上，也倚靠在老人的胳膊上。正如一般人们所认为的那样，孩子们总是不靠在这儿，就靠在那儿。

“那就是她。”盒子打开时，塞德里克说，并且微笑着抬起了眼。老伯爵皱了皱眉毛，他不想看照片，但还是看了。

“我想，你觉得自己很喜欢她，是吗？”他说。

“是的，”方特勒罗伊勋爵说，声音很温柔但很直率，“我是这么觉得的，而且我觉得这是对的。您瞧，霍布斯先生是我的朋友，迪克、布里奇特、玛丽和迈可尔，他们也是我的朋友，但是最最亲爱的——她是我的密友，我们之间总是无话不谈。我父亲留下她让我来照顾。等我长大成人，我就去为她工作、挣钱。”

“你想过要去干什么吗？”他祖父询问道。

小勋爵的身子滑倒在炉边地毯上，他坐在那儿，手里依然拿着照片。在回答这个问题之前，他似乎在进行严肃的沉思。

“我曾经想过，也许我会跟霍布斯先生一起做生意，”他说，“但我应该喜欢的是当总统。”

“但我们会把你送进贵族议院。”他祖父说。

“嗯，”方特勒罗伊勋爵说，“如果我当不了总统，如果进贵族议院是份好差使，我是不应该计较的。在杂货店工作，有时会很枯燥。”

也许他在心里掂量着这事的分量，因为他说完话后非常安静地坐着，久久地看着炉火。

老伯爵没有再说话。他斜靠在椅背上，看着他。一大堆新奇的念头掠过老贵族的心头。杜格尔伸展开身子，头枕着自己的大脚掌，睡着了。房间里长久地静悄悄的。

大约半个小时后，仆人把哈维沙姆先生领进房来。他进门的时候，偌大的房间里一片寂静。老伯爵依然斜靠在椅背上。哈维沙姆先生走近他时，他动了一下，然后抬起手，做了一个警告的手势——但是他似乎不想做这样的手势——就好像他这么做是不情愿的。大狗依然睡着，小方特勒罗伊勋爵也睡着，他紧靠着大狗，长满鬈发的脑袋枕在自己的胳膊上。





第六章　老伯爵和他的小孙孙


次日早上，当方特勒罗伊勋爵醒过来的时候——头天晚上，他被人抱到床上去时，一点儿都没有醒——他首先听到的声音，是木材燃烧的噼啪声和人们说话的叽喳声。

“你要小心点，道森，千万别提起这事。”他听见有人说，“他不知道她为什么不跟他在一起，而且不能让他知道原因。”

“如果这是老爷的命令，夫人，”另一个声音答道，“我想，大家得保守秘密。但是，我想说的是，这是一件残酷的事——那寡妇又漂亮又年轻，但被活生生地与她的亲生骨肉拆开，真是可怜。那孩子也很可怜，也很漂亮，而且出身高贵。昨晚，在仆人住的大堂里，夫人，詹姆斯和托马斯两人说，他们一辈子也没有见过任何一个穿戴贵族衣饰的绅士可以跟小家伙相比。他单纯、懂礼貌，而且兴趣广泛，就好像他是在跟最好的朋友一起坐着吃饭。至于他的相貌，夫人，当我们——詹姆斯和我，听到铃声时就跑进书房，把他带上楼。詹姆斯抱着他，他那天真的小脸蛋通红通红的，玫瑰花似的，他的小脑袋伏在詹姆斯肩膀上，闪闪发光的鬈发披垂下来。你一见到他，就再也不会想着去见更漂亮的孩子了。这是我的看法，老爷对此不会视而不见的，因为他看着小家伙，对詹姆斯说：‘小心点儿，不要把他吵醒了！’”

塞德里克的脑袋在枕头上动了动，然后，翻了个身，睁开了眼睛。

房间里有两个女人，壁炉里火在燃烧，阳光透过爬满常青藤的窗户流进屋子。两个女人一同向他走来。他看见其中的一个是城堡的管家梅隆夫人，另一个是一位看着很和善的中年妇女。

“早上好，少爷。”梅隆夫人说，“你睡得好吗？”

小勋爵揉擦着眼睛微笑着。

“早上好。”他说，“我不知道自己在这儿。”

“你是睡着时被抱上楼来的。”女管家说，“这是你的卧室。这位是道森，以后由她来照顾你。”

方特勒罗伊从床上坐了起来，像昨天把手伸向老伯爵似的，把手伸向道森。

“您好吗，夫人？”他说，“谢谢您来照顾我。”

“你可以叫她道森，少爷，”女管家笑着说，“她习惯于被人称作道森。”

“道森小姐，还是道森夫人？”小勋爵询问道。

“叫道森就行，少爷。”道森自己说道，她浑身都喜洋洋的，“不是小姐，也不是夫人，上帝保佑你，小心肝！你能否现在就起床，让我来给你穿衣服，然后带你去儿童室吃早饭？”

“我好多年前就学会自己穿衣服了，谢谢你，”方特勒罗伊回答道，“是最最亲爱的教我的。‘最最亲爱的’就是我妈妈。我们家只有玛丽一个保姆——干洗衣服等所有的活计——所以我们都不愿意多麻烦她。我还会自己洗澡呢。在我洗完之后，如果您能好心地帮我仔细检查一遍，就很好了。”

道森和女管家交换了一下目光。

“你要道森做什么，她就会做什么。”梅隆夫人说。

“我会的，愿上帝保佑他。”道森说。她的声音听着很舒服，“如果他喜欢，就让他自己穿衣服，我会在旁边站着，如果他需要我，我会随时准备帮他。”

“谢谢你。”方特勒罗伊勋爵答道，“有时候系扣子有点困难，你瞧，那我就得请别人帮忙。”

他觉得道森是一个很好的女人，在他洗完澡、穿好衣服之前，他们就成了好朋友，而且他对她已经了解了很多。他知道了她的丈夫曾是一名军人，在一场战役中牺牲了。她的儿子是一名水手，正在进行远洋航行，见过海盗、吃人的人、中国人和土耳其人，还曾把一些奇怪的贝壳和珊瑚带回家来。道森夫人随时乐意拿给别人看，有些就放在她的衣箱里。所有的这一切都很有趣。他还发现，她一直做的都是照顾孩子的工作，她刚从英国另一个地方的一个大户人家转来，她在那儿照顾一个美丽的小女孩，名叫格威妮丝·沃恩小姐。

“她还是少爷你的一个亲戚呢，”道森说，“也许将来某个时候你还能见到她呢。”

“你觉得我能见到她吗？”方特勒罗伊说，“我喜欢跟她见面，我从来不认识任何女孩子，不过我一直喜欢看她们。”

当他走入隔壁房间里吃早饭时，他发现房间很大，与之相连的还有一个房间。道森告诉他，那房间也是他的。桌子上已经安排好了精美的早餐。当塞德里克坐下来时，他又一次强烈地感到自己实在太小了，他把这种感觉告诉了道森。

“我还是一个小孩子呢。”他若有所思地说，“住在这么大的一个城堡里，拥有这么多的大房间——难道你不认为很奇怪吗？”

“哦，跟我来吧！”道森说，“只是一开始你感到有点奇怪，但是不久你就不会感到奇怪了，你还会喜欢这儿呢。你要知道，这地儿很美。”

“当然，这地儿是很美，”方特勒罗伊说着，轻轻地叹了一声气，“但是如果我不思念我那最最亲爱的，我就会更加喜欢这地儿。早上我一直是跟她一起吃早饭的，帮她在茶里放糖和奶油，还递给她烤面包片，那当然会促进友谊。”

“哦，好了！”道森答道，她觉得那话听得真入耳，“你要知道，你可以天天跟她见面，你该有多少事要告诉她啊。上帝保佑你！等些日子吧，你先在这儿走一走，看一看——狗，马圈，所有的马都在里面。其中有一匹，我想，你会喜欢看的——”

“是吗？”方特勒罗伊惊喜地叫道，“我很喜欢马，尤其喜欢吉姆。那马属于霍布斯先生杂货店里的马车。它不执拗的时候，是一匹非常出色的马。”

“噢，”道森说，“你就期待着吧，直到你看见马圈里的马为止。我亲爱的，你还没有看隔壁房间呢！”

“那里有什么？”方特勒罗伊问道。

“等你吃完了早饭，你就会知道了。”道森说。

一听这话，塞德里克自然开始变得非常好奇，他全力快速地吃完了早饭。他觉得隔壁房间里肯定有一些值得看的东西，从道森说话的神情看来，那东西似乎很重要、很神秘。

“现在，”他说，“我吃饱了，我能去看了吗？”几分钟后，他从座椅上滑了下来。

道森点了点头，在前面带路，那情形看着比刚才更加神秘、更加重要了。塞德里克开始真正兴趣盎然了。

当道森打开房门的时候，他站在门口，惊奇地环顾四周。他没有说话，只是把手放在口袋里，站在那儿朝里头看，他兴奋得额头都红了。

他涨得满脸通红，是因为那一刻他非常惊奇和兴奋。他是一个普通的男孩，当他看到那样的房子，不禁惊诧万分。

这房间跟所有其他房间一样，看起来也很大，他觉得比其他房间更加漂亮，而且有点与众不同。家具和他在楼下房间里所见到的不一样，没有那么大、那么古老。帘布、地毯和墙壁更明亮，架子上装满了书，桌子上有许多玩具——都很漂亮、精巧——在纽约，透过商店橱窗，他也曾着迷地、喜悦地见过类似的玩具。

“这看起来像一个男孩子住的房间，”最后，他屏住呼吸说，“这些东西都是谁的？”

“进去看看吧，”道森说，“它们都属于你！”

“属于我！”他叫了出来，“属于我？为什么属于我？是谁给我的？”他往前跳着，高兴地叫着。房间里东西太多了，几乎令人难以置信。“是爷爷！”他说，他的眼睛亮得像星星似的，“我知道，是爷爷！”

“是的，是老爷给你的，”道森说，“如果你是一个很好的小绅士，不给人添麻烦，你自己玩自己的，整天快快乐乐的，你要什么，他就会给你什么。”

这是一个让人大为兴奋的上午，有太多的东西要看，有太多的试验要做。每一样新东西都是那样吸引人，他几乎不能转过身去去看下一样。当他知道了这一切，他感到很奇怪。所有这些东西都是为他一个人准备的，甚至在他离开纽约之前，有人就从伦敦来安排他要住的房间了，还给他放置好了书和玩具，而且都是最讨他喜欢的。

“谁能有我这样好的祖父呢？”他对道森说，“你见过这样的人吗？”

有一阵子，道森的脸上露出了不安的神情。她对老伯爵的评价并不高。她来城堡还没有多少日子，但她已听够了老伯爵的古怪之处，仆人们在自己的房间里可以非常自由地谈论这问题。

“穿上这家的号衣，我真是倒了八辈子霉了，在所有残忍、野蛮、坏脾气的老头中，”个子最高的仆人曾说，“他是最最凶暴、最最坏的，我敢打赌。”

这位特殊的仆人名叫托马斯，他还向住在楼下的伙伴们一再地说，当他们讨论该如何为塞德里克的到来做好准备工作时，老伯爵吩咐哈维沙姆先生道：

“让他自由自在吧，要在他房间里放满玩具，他喜欢什么，就给他什么，他很快就会忘记他母亲。要讨他欢喜，要在他心里填满跟他母亲无关的东西，我们就不会有任何麻烦。男孩子的本性就是如此。”

因此，当这个真正可爱的小家伙出现在他视野中时，老伯爵发觉，这个特殊的男孩的本性似乎并非就是如此，这使他非常不快。老伯爵一夜没睡好觉，上午一直待在自己的房间里，但是中午的时候，他吃完午饭后，就派人叫来了他的孙子。

方特勒罗伊一听到传唤就来了。他蹑手蹑脚地走下宽阔的楼梯，老伯爵听到他穿过大厅的脚步声，然后门就开了，他走了进来，脸颊红彤彤的，眼睛亮闪闪的。

“我正在等您派人来叫我呢。”他说，“我已经等了很久了。您给了我那些东西，我将永远感激您！永远感激您！整个上午我一直在玩那些玩具。”

“哦！”老伯爵说，“你喜欢它们，是吗？”

“我非常喜欢它们——哦，我无法告诉您我有多喜欢！”方特勒罗伊说。他的脸上闪着快乐的光，“有一种游戏，很像棒球运动，您可以在一块有黑白标杆的木板上玩儿，用串在一根金属线上的筹码来计算得分。我曾努力教过道森，但她一开始就不能很好地理解这种游戏——您瞧，那是因为她是个女的，从来不玩棒球。我想可能是我没向她说清楚。不过，您全都明白，不是吗？”

“我恐怕不会，”老伯爵答道，“这是一项美国体育运动，不是吗？它有点像板球吗？”

“我从没见过板球，”方特勒罗伊说，“不过，霍布斯先生曾经带我去看过几次棒球比赛，好看极了。真是激动万分！要不要我去把我的游戏用具拿来，给您演示一下？也许，您会觉得好玩，从而使您忘掉脚痛。今天早上您的脚疼得厉害吗？”

“疼得挺难受的。”老伯爵答道。

“那您就忘不了了。”小家伙焦急地说，“也许，跟您谈比赛的事儿，您也会觉得烦扰。您觉得是愉快呢还是烦扰？”

“去拿吧。”老伯爵说。

这当然是一项新的娱乐活动——由一个孩子陪伴着，那孩子教他如何玩游戏——不过，这种游戏非常新奇，这使他感到高兴。他的嘴角边暗含着微笑。这时，塞德里克回来了，抱着一个盒子。盒子里装着他的玩具，脸上流露着迫不及待的表情。

“我可不可以把那张小桌子拉到您的椅子这边来？”塞德里克问道。

“打铃叫托马斯吧，”老伯爵说，“他会来帮你搬的。”

“哦，我自己会搬。”方特勒罗伊答说，“这桌子并不重。”

“很好。”他祖父答说。那老头看着小家伙饶有兴致地坐着各项准备工作，因为暗笑而脸上都起了皱纹。小桌子被往前推到了他的椅子旁边，塞德里克从盒子里拿出玩具，放到了桌子上。

“您一玩起来就会有很大的兴趣，”方特勒罗伊说，“您瞧，黑色标杆是您那边的，白色标杆是我这边的。您要知道，他们代表人。绕场地一圈是本垒，得一分——这些是出局者——这是一垒，这是二垒，这是三垒，这是本垒。”

他兴致勃勃地开始做详细的解释，他演示投球手、接球手和击球手在真正比赛中的姿势，还生动地描述了精彩的“重球”，曾经有一次，他跟霍布斯先生一起亲眼见过这样的重球。他那健美的小身子、热情的姿势和单纯的快乐，让人一看就觉得舒适。

最终，所有的解释和说明都结束了，游戏在愉快而认真的气氛中开始了。老伯爵仍然发现自己玩兴正浓，而他的小伙伴则完全被游戏吸引住了。他以整个孩子气的心灵，以准确投球时发出来的快乐而短暂的笑声，以对“本垒打”的热情，以对他自己的好运和对手的好运都感到高兴的心情，给任何游戏都增添了别样的滋味。

一个星期前，假如有人跟老伯爵说，在那个特殊的上午，他会在一个满头鬈发的小男孩的陪伴下玩一个孩子的游戏，即在一块粉刷华丽的木板上，用黑白标杆打棒球；在这样的游戏中，他会忘却痛风和自己的坏脾气。假如有人这么跟他说，他会毫无疑问地感到很不高兴。但是，现在，他已经在游戏中忘记了自己。

这时房门打开了，托马斯报告说，有客人来了。

来宾是一个老年绅士，全身穿着黑色的衣服，是本教区的一名牧师。他看到眼前这美妙的场面的，大吃一惊，几乎往后倒退了一步，差点跟托马斯撞了个满怀。

尊敬的莫当特先生出于责任需要被迫去城堡拜访那位高贵的施主。事实上，没有任何别的责任比这份责任更使他感到不愉快的。那位高贵的施主也确实常常把这样的拜访弄得很不愉快，这样做是在他的贵族权利范围之内的。他憎恨教会和慈善机构。当他的某个佃农因为贫病交加而需要他帮助时，他会大发雷霆。当他的痛风发作得最厉害时，他会毫不犹豫地大声宣告：他们再向他诉说悲惨和不幸的事儿，他就要受不了了，就要发脾气了。当他的痛风让他感到不那么烦恼时，他的心灵会显示出更多的人性。在以最让人痛苦的方式奚落教区长之后，在严厉指责整个教区的无能和低能之后，他也许会给教区长施舍一点钱。但是，无论他怀着什么样的心情，他绝对不会停止没完没了地发表讽刺别人并让人难堪的演说，还会让尊敬的莫当特先生觉得，把沉重的东西扔给他是正当的，而且更像基督徒。在莫当特先生掌管多林考特教区的岁月里，他不记得自己曾经见过老伯爵完全出于自愿做过任何好事，或者，在任何情况下，他表现出他想着的是别人，而不是他自己。

他今天来拜访老伯爵，是要跟他谈一件特别紧迫的事情。在他上路之后，他意识到，这次拜访比平常更让他感到害怕。此间有两个原因：他知道老伯爵这几天一直在犯痛风病，心情糟糕透了，以至于这一情况已经传到了村子里——是由城堡里的一个年轻女仆传过去的。她姐姐开着一家小店，零售针线、薄荷油和传言，作为诚实谋生的一种手段。如果迪布尔夫人只知道村子和农夫，而不知道城堡和城堡里的人，那么，她就真的不值一提。当然，她对城堡了如指掌。因为她妹妹简·肖茨是城堡里地位比较高的仆人，而且跟托马斯是好友、密友。

“老爷的做事方式会继续下去！”迪布尔夫人隔着柜台说，“而他的说话方式呢，托马斯先生跟简本人说，没有一个仆人能忍受得了这种从精神到肉体的折磨。就在最近两天，老爷曾向托马斯先生扔过面包盘子。假如不是因为有其他让他感到愉快的事物，假如不是因为楼下那些人非常有教养；那么，他会在一小时之内向我们发出警报！”

教区长耳闻了这一切。不知何故，老伯爵成了村子里的一只人见人爱的黑绵羊；而他糟糕的言行举止则成了许多女人茶余饭后的谈资。

第二个原因甚至更恶劣，因为这是新的，而且人们谈起来就会兴致勃勃。

谁不知道：当老爷英俊的上尉儿子娶了一个美国女人时，他是多么恼怒？谁不知道：他对待上尉是多么残酷，而那个高大、乐呵呵的始终带着甜蜜微笑的年轻人是这个大家族中唯一一位被大家所喜欢的成员，却死在了异国他乡，穷困潦倒，而且没有得到自己父亲的原谅？谁不知道：老爷是多么憎恨他的儿媳妇——那个可怜的年轻寡妇，又是多么厌恶那寡妇的孩子，从来没有要见见那个小男孩的意思——直到另外两个儿子都死了，而且没有给他留下继承人？还有，谁不知道：他盼望着孙子的到来，但没有任何感情，也不感到高兴，而且他以为自己看到的肯定是一个粗俗、笨拙而鲁莽的美国小赤佬，那男孩子与其说能光宗耀祖，还不如说有辱门庭？

这傲慢而易怒的老人以为他藏起了自己所有的想法。他料想，任何人都不敢猜度他的想法，更别说是谈论他的感想了；但是，仆人们察言观色，揣摩着他糟糕的心情和阴沉的表情，还在仆人房间里议论纷纷。当托马斯认为自己远离众人、足够安全时，他对简、厨子、脚夫和其他女仆说：“在我看来，老头一想起上尉的儿子，就表现得比平常更糟糕，因为他预料，那孩子既无补于家族的荣耀，也不会好好地伺候他。”托马斯又说，“他的想法没错。对一个生长在美国那样可怜的环境的低贱的孩子，他又能指望什么呢？”

当尊敬的莫当特先生走在那几棵大树底下时，他想起那个可怜的小男孩头天晚上已经来到了城堡，老爷最坏的担心八成已经应验。假如那可怜的小家伙让老爷感到失望，那么他现在有十二分的可能已经是暴跳如雷，准备把所有的怒气都发泄在头一个前来拜访他的人身上——那个人很可能就是莫当特他自己。

让莫当特先生感到惊愕的是：当托马斯推开书房的门，传入他耳朵的是一串快乐的孩子气的笑声。

“您输了两局了！”一个清脆而稚嫩的声音激动地喊道，“要知道，您输两局了！”

莫当特先生看到了老伯爵的椅子和用来搁他痛风的腿的凳子，在他身边，有一张小桌子，桌子上是一盘玩具。一个小男孩紧靠着他，实际上是倚靠着他的胳膊和那个没有患病的膝盖。那小男孩容光焕发，兴奋地转动着眼睛。“您输了两局了！”陌生的小孩叫道，“这回您没好运了吧，不是吗？”就在此时，两人都意识到有人进了门。

老伯爵环顾四周，蓬松的眉毛拧成了两个结，就好像他在谋划什么事。莫当特先生发现，老头看起来并没有比平常更不快乐。事实上，那一刻他看上去似乎已经忘却了自己的不快；当他想要让自己变得不快乐，他就会真的郁郁寡欢。

“啊！”老伯爵说，声音很嘶哑，但他伸手的动作相当优雅，“上午好，莫当特。我找到了一个新的工作，你瞧。”

他把另一只手放在塞德里克的肩膀上——也许在内心深处，他是傲慢的，当他轻轻地把男孩推向前时，他眼中闪现出快乐的光芒。

“这是新来的方特勒罗伊勋爵。”他说，“方特勒罗伊，这位是莫当特先生，教区长。”

方特勒罗伊抬头看着这位身穿教服的绅士，并且伸出了手。

“我很高兴跟您认识，先生。”他说道，这话是他从霍布斯先生那儿听来的。当霍布斯先生礼貌地跟新顾客打招呼时，曾有一两回说了这话。

塞德里克感到确信的是，人们对牧师应该比对常人更有礼貌。

莫当特先生低头看孩子的脸时，抓住了孩子的小手，不自然地笑着。从那一刻起，他就喜欢上了小家伙——实际上，人们都是一见面就喜欢他了。最吸引莫当特先生的，并不是男孩的漂亮和优雅，而是男孩本性中简朴而自然的善良，正是这种善良使他说出来的话，虽然稀奇古怪、出人意料，但听起来还是很愉悦、很可信。当教区长看着塞德里克时，他一点都没意识到老伯爵的存在。世上没有一样东西比一颗善良的心更有力，尽管这只是一个孩子的心，但是从某种意义上来说，这颗小小的善良之心清除了大房间里所有阴郁的气氛，使之变得更明亮了。

“很高兴认识你，方特勒罗伊少爷，”教区长说，“你走了很长的路，来到我们这儿。知道你一路平安，许许多多人会感到高兴的。”

“路途是很长，”方特勒罗伊答道，“不过，最最亲爱的，我的母亲，跟我在一起，我并不孤独。如果有你母亲跟你在一起，你当然永远不会孤独，而且轮船很好看。”

“请坐，莫当特。”老伯爵说。莫当特先生坐了下来，他的目光从方特勒罗伊转到老伯爵身上。

“老爷您得好好庆贺庆贺。”他热情地说。

但是在这个话题上，老伯爵一点都不想显示自己的感情。

“他很像他父亲，”他说，声音相当粗暴，“让我们希望，他能表现得更加叫人信服。”随后他又说：“哦，今儿早上是怎么回事，莫当特，谁有麻烦了？”

这事并不像莫当特先生所预料的那样糟糕，但在他回答之前，他还是犹豫了一会儿。

“是希金斯。”他说，“边缘农场的希金斯。他一向很不幸。去年秋天，他自己生病了，而他的孩子们又传染上了猩红热。我不能说他是一个很好的经营者，但是他运气不好，在许多方面确实落后于人。他现在的麻烦是租金。纽威克告诉他，如果他不付租金，他就得离开那儿，那样问题当然就异常严重了。他妻子病了，昨天，他来到我那儿，求我为这事来看望您，并求您放宽期限。他认为如果您给他时间，他就能赶上来。”

“他们都是那样想的。”老伯爵说，他看上去怒气冲冲。

方特勒罗伊往前动了一动，他一直站在祖父和来宾之间，竭尽全力听着。他当下就对希金斯产生了兴趣，他想知道他有几个孩子，以及猩红热是否使他们大受伤害。当莫当特先生继续他的谈话时，塞德里克双眼瞪得大大的，怀着浓厚的兴趣，紧盯着那位绅士。

“希金斯是一个本性良好、命运不济的人。”教区长说，他是在努力强调他的请求。

“他是一个坏透了的仆人，”老伯爵说道，“而且他总是落在别人后面，这是纽威克告诉我的。”

“他现在有大困难了，”教区长说，“他很爱他的妻子和孩子，如果您收回他们的田地，他们确实就会挨饿。他没有能力给他们提供他们所需的营养品。两个孩子自从得了猩红热之后，变得非常瘦小，医生吩咐希金斯给他们买点好喝的、好吃的，但他没有钱去买。”

听到这话，方特勒罗伊又往前走近了一步。

“那情形跟迈可尔家一样。”他说。

老伯爵有点惊诧。“我把你给忘了！”他说，“我忘了这房间里有一个慈善家呢。谁是迈可尔？”老头那深陷的眼睛里，又闪现出一种奇怪而高兴的目光。

“他是布里奇特的丈夫，也得了热病，”方特勒罗伊答道，“他也没钱付租金，买药酒和其他东西。您把那笔钱给了我，才解救了他。”

老伯爵的双眉皱在一起，形成一种古怪的形状，但一点儿都没有阴郁的样子。

他说：“我曾告诉哈维沙姆先生，这孩子要什么，就能得到什么——而他所要的，似乎就是打发乞丐的钱。”

“哦！但是他们可不是乞丐啊。”方特勒罗伊着急地说，“迈可尔是一个很出色的泥瓦匠！他们都有工作。”

“哦！”老伯爵说，“他们不是乞丐，是出色的泥瓦匠、补鞋匠和苹果贩子。”

他低头向小男孩默默地看了一会儿，一个新的念头来到了他心里。尽管产生这念头的动机不是最最高贵的情绪，但这念头本身并不坏。“到这儿来。”最后他说。

方特勒罗伊走了过去，尽可能近地靠着他，又注意不去碰那痛风的脚。

“你愿意怎么处理这事？”老伯爵问道。

必须承认，莫当特先生当时体验到了一种古怪的感觉。作为一个极擅长思考的人，而且在多林考特田庄上已经生活了这么多年，他认识所有的佃户，所有的村民——不管是富的还是穷的，不管是诚实的还是不诚实的，不管是勤劳的还是懒惰的。他强烈地意识到，老伯爵的权力，不管是善的还是恶的，将来都会留传给这个小男孩。孩子站在那儿，褐色的眼睛瞪得大大的，双手深深地插在衣兜里。莫当特先生还想到，那老头傲慢、放纵而且反复无常，他现在可能就在将大权转交给那孩子。如果这孩子的本性年幼时就不单纯、不大方，不管对其他人，还是对他自己，这都可能是最最糟糕的。

“你愿意怎么处理这事？”老伯爵又问方特勒罗伊。

方特勒罗伊又靠近了一点儿，把手放在老人的膝盖上，那神情让老人无可置疑地觉得他们俩是志同道合的。

“如果我很富有，”他说，“而且不仅仅只是一个小孩，我应该让他留下来，而且还要送东西给他的孩子，不过话说回来，我只是一个孩子罢了。”随后，他顿了顿，脸色明显亮了起来。“您能做任何事，不是吗？”他说。

“是啊！”老伯爵说道，眼睛紧盯着他，“那是你的想法，是吗？”他并没有不高兴。

“我的意思是，您可以给任何人任何东西。”方特勒罗伊说，“谁是纽威克？”

“他是我的代理人，”老伯爵答道，“我的有些佃户不太喜欢他。”

“现在您打算给他写封信吗？”方特勒罗伊询问道，“要不要我给您拿笔和墨？”

老伯爵停顿了一会儿，仍然盯着他。“你会写字吗？”他问道。

“会啊，”塞德里克答道，“但写得不太好。”

“那就把桌子上的东西拿走，”老伯爵命令道，“把笔和墨拿来，再从我书桌里拿张纸来。”

莫当特先生的兴趣浓厚起来。方特勒罗伊遵照命令熟练地行动起来。几分钟后，纸、笔和大墨水台都准备好了。

“都拿来了！”塞德里克高兴地说，“您可以写了。”

“你来写吧。”老伯爵说。

“我！”方特勒罗伊惊呼道，他的额头上泛起了红晕，“如果我写，会有效吗？手头没有词典，又没有人帮我指正时，我有时候会拼错单词。”

“会有效的，”老伯爵答道，“希金斯不会抱怨你的拼写错误的。我不是一个慈善家，你才是。用你的笔蘸墨水吧。”

方特勒罗伊拿起笔，插入墨水瓶。然后他调整了自己的姿势，身体倚靠在桌子上。

“那，”他询问道，“我该说些什么呢？”

“你可以说，‘目前不要终止希金斯的契约。’然后签上你的大名‘方特勒罗伊’。”老伯爵说。

方特勒罗伊又拿起笔，插入墨水中，胳膊顿了一下，开始写了起来。他写得相当缓慢、相当严肃，但他把整个灵魂都投入进去了。过了一阵子，初稿写成了，他笑着交给祖父，但也流露出焦虑。

“您觉得这管用吗？”他问道。

老伯爵看着纸条，嘴角骤然抽动了一下。

“管用，”他答道，“这纸条会让希金斯十分满意。”说完，他把纸条交给了莫当特先生。

莫当特先生看到纸上写的是：





亲爱的纽威克先生，请您不要在目前终止希金斯的契约，谢谢。

尊敬您的方特勒罗伊





“霍布斯先生总是那样在他的信上署名的。”方特勒罗伊说，“我觉得我最好说‘请’。‘终止’一词我写得完全正确吗？”

“跟词典上的拼法并不完全一样。”老伯爵答道。

“我怕也是。”方特勒罗伊说，“我应该问问您的。您瞧，拼写多音节单词时，就得查词典，这是最安全的做法。我再来写一遍。”

他重写了一遍，抄写得相当庄重。为了预防拼写错误，他还请教了老伯爵。

“拼写是很古怪的事，”他说，“往往跟您所预料的大不相同。我过去常认为‘please’应该拼成‘plees’，但您知道，实际上不对。而如果不向人请教的话，‘dear’可能会拼成‘dere’。有时候这几乎要让人气馁。”

当莫当特先生离开房间时，他带上了信，也带上了别的东西——以前他来造访多林考特城堡后，沿着那条大道回家时，从来没有像这一次这样高兴、充满希望。

方特勒罗伊陪送他到门口，等他走了，回到祖父身边。

“我现在可以去看最最亲爱的了吗？”他说，“我想她该在等我了。”

老伯爵沉默了一会儿。

“马圈里有样东西，你先去看看吧，”他说，“拉铃。”

“我请求您，”方特勒罗伊说，脸上迅速泛起了微微的红晕，“我很感激您，可是我想，我最好是明天再去看吧。她会一直等我的。”

“好吧，”老伯爵答道，“咱们去要车，”说完，他干巴巴地加了一句，“是匹小马驹。”

方特勒罗伊抽了一口长气。

“一匹小马驹！”他惊呼道，“谁的小马驹？”

“你的。”老伯爵答道。

“我的？”小家伙叫道，“我的——就像楼上的那些东西？”

“是的，”他祖父说，“你想去看一看吗？要不要我叫人把它牵来溜一溜？”

方特勒罗伊的脸颊越来越红了。

“我从来没有想过我会有一匹小马驹！”他说，“我从未想过！最最亲爱的该多么高兴啊。您会把所有的东西都给我，是吗？”

“你想看看小马驹吗？”老伯爵询问道。

方特勒罗伊又抽了一口长气。“我想看看它。”他说，“我太想看它了，我都快等不及了。不过我怕是没有时间了。”

“你一定要今天下午去看你母亲吗？”老伯爵问道，“你觉得你没法推迟吗？”

“为什么要推迟呢？”方特勒罗伊说，“她整个上午都在想着我，我也一直在想念她。”

“哦！”老伯爵说，“你一直在想她，是吗？拉铃吧。”

他们俩乘坐的马车行驶在大道上，两边的伞形大树搭起了拱廊，老伯爵一直沉默着。但是方特勒罗伊并不安静，他谈论着小马驹：什么颜色啊？有多大啊？叫什么名字啊？它最喜欢吃什么啊？有几岁了啊？早上它会多早起来啊？

“最最亲爱的会多高兴啊！”他一直重复着这话，“您对我这么好，她会万分感激您的！她知道我一直很喜欢小马驹，但是我们从来没有想过，我自己会有一匹。第五大街上的一个小男孩有一匹，他每天早上都要骑出来，我们经常散步经过他家，去看他骑马。”

他靠在椅背上，有几分钟时间他全神贯注地看着老伯爵，一声不响。

“我觉得您是世上最好的人。”他终于开口说道，“您一直在做好事，一直想着别人——是吗？最最亲爱的说那是最最善良的。不想着自己，却想着别人，那就是您一贯的做法，是吗？”

老伯爵发现自己被涂上了如此受人喜欢的颜色，惊得目瞪口呆，真不知道该说些什么。他觉得他需要时间想一想。看到自己的每一种丑陋而自私的动机，在一个单纯的孩子的眼里都变成了善良和大方，他感到很奇怪。

方特勒罗伊继续说着，仍然用仰慕的目光看着他——那双眼睛是那么大、那么亮、那么纯。

“您让这么多人幸福，”他说，“有迈可尔、布里奇特和他们的十二个孩子，还有卖苹果的老妇人、迪克、霍布斯先生、希金斯先生和希金斯太太以及他们的孩子，还有莫当特先生——因为他当然也很高兴——另外还有最最亲爱的和我，您给了我们小马驹和所有其他的东西。您瞧，我一边扳着手指一边在心里数着呢，您对二十七个人行过善。真多啊——有二十七个呢！”

“我这人对他们都很好——是吗？”老伯爵说。

“是的，是的，您知道，”方特勒罗伊答道，“您使他们都得到了幸福。您知道吗？”他微微犹豫了一下：“当人们不认识伯爵时，他们有时候会对伯爵有误解。霍布斯先生就是这样一个人。我打算给他写信，把您的事告诉他。”

“霍布斯先生对伯爵有什么看法呢？”老伯爵问道。

“呃，要知道，困难的是，”小家伙答道，“他一个伯爵都不认识，只是读过有关他们的书。他认为——您不会介意吧——他们都是血腥的暴君，他还说，他不愿意让他们到他的店里去。但是如果他认识您，我确信，他的看法会完全不同。我会把您的情况告诉他的。”

“你会告诉他什么？”

“我会告诉他，”方特勒罗伊说，他脸上散发着热情的光，“您是我所听说过的最最好的人。还有，您一直想着别人，让他们幸福，还有——还有，我希望，我长大后，跟您一个样儿。”

“跟我一个样儿！”老伯爵重复道，眼睛看着那张闪闪发光的小脸蛋。在他自己那饱经风霜的脸皮下，一股暗淡的红晕爬了上来。他突然眼睛转向别处，望着车窗外高大的山毛榉树，阳光照着它们那光滑的、红褐色的叶子。

“如果可以的话，”方特勒罗伊谦虚地说，“我就要像您一样，也许我不够好，但我将努力做一个好人。”

在宽广的道路上，在枝繁叶茂的树底下，马车继续行驶着，穿过绿色阴影的空地和金色阳光的空隙。方特勒罗伊又一次看见那些可爱的地方了：蕨类植物高高长着，蓝铃花在微风中摇曳。马车驶过时，他看见了在深草丛中站着或躺着的麋鹿，它们转动着好奇的大眼睛去看棕色兔子四散逃去。他听见鹌鹑和其他鸟儿的鸣叫和歌唱，他觉得这一切比以前更美了。处处都是美景，他全身心都充满了快乐和幸福。但是，尽管老伯爵明显然也看着窗外，但他看见的和听见的与塞德里克的很不一样。他看见自己漫长的一生中，既没有过大方的行为，也没有过善良的念头。他看见一个人，在他年轻、健壮、富有而又有权力的年岁里，只把他的青春、力量、财富和权力用来寻欢作乐，只是一天又一天、一年又一年地混日子。他看见，当时间被消磨殆尽，苍老骤然来临，那人在庞大的财富中，却很孤独，没有一个真心的朋友。他看见，有人讨厌他、害怕他，也有人奉承他、阿谀他，但是除非关系到他们的得失时，否则没有人真正关心他是死是活。他望着窗外宽广的田地，那都是属于他的。他知道方特勒罗伊所不知道的情况——这些田地伸展得多远，代表的是何等规模的财富，多少人靠着那份佃来的田地养家糊口。他还知道另一个方特勒罗伊所不知道的情况——在所有那些家庭中，不管是卑贱的还是富裕的，可能不会有一个人会在刹那间想过，要称呼他们的贵族老爷为“好主子”，或者像这个灵魂单纯的小男孩似的，希望自己像他一样——不管那人实际上是多么嫉妒他的财富、威名和权力，也不管那人是多么想拥有这些东西。

七十年来，老头一直很自足，只要他的舒服或玩乐不受阻碍，他就从来不屑于屈尊去关心世人对他的看法。纵然他愤世嫉俗、老于世故，但当他对此进行反思时，他还是感到了些微的不快。事实上，他以前从来没有屈尊对此做出反思，此刻他之所以进行反思，是因为一个孩子相信，表面的他比真实的他要更好，还希望跟随他杰出的脚步，学习他的榜样。这给他提出了一个古怪的问题：他这个人是否真的可以被当作一个典范？

方特勒罗伊以为老伯爵的脚肯定又疼起来了，因为当老人看着窗外的林苑时，他的双眉又拧在了一起。想到此，善解人意的小家伙尽量不去打扰他，径自默默地欣赏蕨类植物、树木和麋鹿。直到最后，马车驶过了几道大门，稳当而快速地穿过一小段林荫小径后，停了下来。他们到达了罗奇苑，那高大的仆人几乎还没来得及打开车门，方特勒罗伊已经跳出车子，站在了地上。

老伯爵大吃一惊，从白日梦中醒了过来。

“啊！”他说，“咱们到了这儿啦？”

“是的，”方特勒罗伊说，“让我来当您的拐棍。您下车时，就靠在我身上。”

“我不想下车。”老爷粗鲁地答道。

“您不去——不去看看最最亲爱的？”方特勒罗伊问道，他一脸的惊奇。

“‘最最亲爱的’会原谅我的。”老伯爵干巴巴地说，“到她那儿去，去告诉她，哪怕是一匹新得的小马驹，也不会让你离开她。”

“她会失望的。”方特勒罗伊说，“她很想见见您。”

“我怕是不行。”老头答道，“我们会转回来接你——托马斯，告诉杰弗里斯，继续往前走。”

托马斯关住了车门。迷惑地看了一会儿后，方特勒罗伊向房门跑去。老伯爵有机会——正如哈维沙姆先生曾经有的那样——看见一双漂亮而健壮的小腿，以令人惊奇的速度，飞掠过地面。显而易见，它们的主人不想浪费一丁点儿时间。马车慢慢地驶远了，但是老伯爵并没有马上就靠在椅背上，他还在往外看着。透过林间的空隙，他能看见房门敞开着。那小小的身影急匆匆地走上了台阶，另一个身影——同样很娇小、苗条而且年轻，穿着黑色的外套——跑过来迎接那孩子。他们俩似乎是飞在一起的，方特勒罗伊跳着扑入母亲的怀抱，吊在她的脖子上，用密集的吻盖满了她那甜美而年轻的脸庞。





第七章　在教堂里


在接下来的那个星期天上午，莫当特主持了一个盛大的集会。事实上，在他的记忆中，从来没有一次聚会像这一次那样，教堂里拥挤不堪。那些极少来给他捧场听他布道的人，这次也出现了，甚至还有从临近教区哈滋顿来的人。被太阳烤晒得黝黑的农夫们都很虔诚，他们的妻子身体结实而匀称，脸颊像苹果似的，都戴着最美观的无边女帽和最华丽的围巾，每家平均都有大约五六个孩子。医生的妻子也来了，带着她的四个女儿，基穆西夫妇坐在靠背长凳上，他们俩经营着一个药店，还出售土制药品，给方圆十里的人们包装药粉。迪布尔夫人坐着，村子里的裁缝斯米弗小姐和她的朋友、女帽设计师珀金斯小姐也坐着。出席聚会的还有医生的助手、药剂师的徒弟，实际上，村子里几乎每家都有代表参加。

在此前的那个礼拜中，人们争先谈论许多关于小方特勒罗伊勋爵的美妙故事。迪布尔夫人一直忙得不可开交，她得招待顾客。他们有的借口来买一个便士的针，或半个便士的胶布，目的是要来听她讲故事。来来往往的人是如此之多，以至于小店门上的铃铛频繁地被敲着，几乎都被敲哑了。迪布尔夫人完全知道：小勋爵的房间是如何装饰的，给他买的玩具有多贵，一匹漂亮的小马驹和一辆小马车是如何在等着他，他还有一辆单匹马拉的小马车，马具是用银子造的。她还能告诉人们，孩子到达的那个晚上，当仆人们瞥见他的时候，都说了些什么话。楼下的女仆们说，让可怜而可爱的孩子跟他的母亲分开，是多么遗憾的事。当孩子一个人走进书房，去看他的祖父时，仆人们都说他们的心都快提到嗓子眼儿上了，因为“谁也不知道老爷会怎么对待他，而老爷的脾气足以让那些老皮老脸的人们惊慌失措，更不要说孩子了”。

“但是，如果你相信我的话，珍妮弗太太，”迪布尔太太说，“当时孩子不知道害怕——这是托马斯先生说的，他坐在那儿，笑着，跟老爷谈着，就好像他们一见面就成了朋友似的。托马斯先生说，伯爵靠在椅背上，只是听着，浓眉下的眼睛一直盯着孩子。贝茨太太，托马斯认为，老爷虽然很坏，但在他隐秘的灵魂深处，他是又高兴又骄傲的。因为小家伙长得漂亮，而且还很懂礼貌。托马斯先生说，老爷是一个老古董，从来不曾希望看到这样的孩子。”

然后说到的是希金斯的故事，这是莫当特牧师在餐桌上亲口说的。仆人听到后就在厨房里告诉了别人，于是这个故事就从厨房里传了出来，像野火似的迅速蔓延开来了。迪布尔夫人的面纱向后甩着，这使人们能看清她那无比甜美的脸庞，以及那小巧的寡妇帽下明亮的秀发，柔和有如孩子的鬈发。

赶集那天，当希金斯出现在镇上的时候，人们围上来，问他有关的问题。纽威克也被问了，在回答的时候，他还拿着有“方特勒罗伊”署名的便条，给两三个人看了。于是农妇们在喝茶的时候，购物的时候，找到了足够的谈资。星期天，她们或者到教堂去，或者乘着她们的丈夫驾驶的轻便双轮马车去教堂。也许男人们自己也对新来的小勋爵有点儿好奇，因为到时，小勋爵将会成为他们的田地的主人。

伯爵从来没有上教堂的习惯，但是在塞德里克到来的第一个礼拜天，他选择去了教堂——而且他一时心血来潮，坐在家庭用的大靠背凳上，让方特勒罗伊坐在他身边。

那天上午，有许多在教堂里闲逛的人，也有许多在小路上停留的人。大小门口有成群结队的人。关于小勋爵是否会真的出现这个问题，人们争论很多。当争论达到高峰时，一个善良的农妇突然叫了出来。

“啊！”她说，“那肯定是他母亲，多年轻多漂亮啊。”

所有听到这话的人都转身看着那苗条的身影。她穿着黑色的衣服，走上前来。

她一点儿不关心周围的人们，她关心的是方特勒罗伊。方特勒罗伊来拜访她，骑在他那匹新得的小马驹上，得意扬扬的。前天他就骑着小马驹来到她的门口，直直地坐在马背上，显得非常骄傲而且快乐。但是，不久，她就注意到，周围人们都在看她，她的到来引起了轰动。她一开始注意到这一事实，是因为一个穿着大红外套的老妇人向她行了个屈膝礼，随后另一个老妇人也行了一个屈膝礼，并且说：“上帝保佑您，夫人！”当她走过时，男人们一个接一个致以脱帽礼。起初她弄不明白，随后她意识到：因为她是小勋爵方特勒罗伊的母亲，所以他们才这么做。她羞涩地涨红了脸，一边笑着，一边鞠躬，用温柔的声音，对那个祝福她的老妇人说：“谢谢。”对于一个常年生活在吵吵嚷嚷的、拥挤不堪的美国城市里的人来说，这种简单的敬礼法非常新颖，一开始她有点尴尬，但后来，她禁不住喜欢上了这种礼法，它似乎表示着友好和热情，她被打动了。她一穿过石门，进入教堂，那天的大事就发生了。从城堡来的马车由骏马拉着，由高大的穿着号衣的仆人驾着，驶过拐角，上了林荫小径。

“他们来了！”站在路边观看的人们一个个传着这话。

然后马车驶到了人们跟前，托马斯跳下来，打开了门。一个小男孩跳了出来，他穿着黑色天鹅绒衣服，一头漂亮的、明亮的头发飘飞着。

每一个男人、女人和孩子都惊奇地看着他。

“他简直就是又一个上尉！”那些还能记得起他父亲的人说，“他简直就是上尉再生！”

当托马斯帮着伯爵走出车门时，塞德里克站在阳光中，抬头看着伯爵，他向他伸出手，还把肩膀凑过去，就好像他有七英尺高似的。大家都很容易看出来，不管多林考特伯爵跟别人的关系如何，他没有在他孙子的心中引起恐惧。

“就靠着我吧。”人们听见塞德里克说，“见到您，大家都是那么高兴，他们对您都是那么熟悉啊！”

“摘下你的帽子，方特勒罗伊。”伯爵说，“他们在向你鞠躬呢。”

“向我！”方特勒罗伊喊道。他立即摘下帽子，将光亮的脑袋展现给人群，又将闪烁的、迷惑的双眼转向大家，就好像他努力要一次性地向众人鞠躬。

“上帝保佑你，少爷！”那个祝福过他母亲穿着红色外套的老妇人，边行屈膝礼边说，“祝你长命百岁！”

“谢谢你，夫人。”方特勒罗伊说。随后他们走进教堂，众人看着他们沿着中间的过道走向那宽阔而结实的靠背长凳。凳子上放着红色的背垫，还盖着布罩。当方特勒罗伊完全坐下来时，他得到了两个都使他高兴的发现。第一个发现是：他的目光穿过教堂，能看见她——他母亲坐着，正对着他微笑呢；第二个发现是：在凳子的另一头，即靠着墙的那一头，跪着两个石像，它们面对着面，分别跪在石柱的两边，顶着两部石雕的祈祷书。它们长着尖角的双手交叠着，就好像是在祈祷。它们的衣饰很古老、很奇怪。它们旁边有一块石板，上面刻着文字，方特勒罗伊只能读出一些古怪的词：

“第一任多林考特格列高利·阿瑟伯爵暨他的妻子阿丽松·希尔德加德之墓。”

“我能问您个事吗？”小勋爵询问道，话音中充满了好奇。

“你想问什么？”他祖父说。

“他们是谁？”

“你的两个祖先，”伯爵答道，“他们生活在几百年前呢。”

“也许，”方特勒罗伊勋爵看着石像，心里充满了敬仰，他说，“也许我的姓氏就来自他们呢。”说完，他往前走进教堂，找到了自己的位置。当圣乐响起时，他站了起来，目光越过人群，微笑地看着母亲。他很喜欢音乐，母亲经常跟他一起唱歌，所以他加入了其他人的合唱，他那纯粹、甜美、高亢的声音像鸟鸣一样清脆。伯爵坐在靠背长凳有帘子遮着的一角，看着塞德里克，忘我地沉浸在了歌声的快乐之中。塞德里克站着，手里捧着打开的大本诗篇，使尽吃奶的力气高声唱着，他的脸快乐地微微抬着。在他歌唱的时候，一缕长长的阳光爬了进来，透过彩色玻璃窗金黄色的格子斜射进来，照亮了那幼稚的脸上飘垂的长发。他母亲的目光也穿过整个教堂，看着他，感到有一股刺痛穿透心胸，同时又在心中升起了一声祈祷。她祈祷，让她孩子的心灵永远洁净、单纯、快乐，那样一大宗奇异的财产突然降临给他，但愿不要因此而带来错误和罪恶。在刚来的那些日子里，在她那温柔的心中，有许多柔和但又焦虑的念头。

“哦！塞德里克！”头天晚上，在他将要离开的时候，她把他整个抱在怀里，跟他道别。她对他说：“哦，塞德里克，亲爱的，为了你，我真希望自己是一个非常聪明的人，那样我就能说出一大堆愿望！但现在我只能祝愿你过得好，亲爱的，祝愿你永远勇敢、善良、真诚，那样在你的有生之年，就永远不会去伤害别人，你就能去帮助许多人，这偌大的世界就会因为我的小不点儿的出生，而变得更加美好。塞迪，最好的是——好于其他一切的是，这世界能因为一个人的人生而变得更加美好些——哪怕是一丁点儿的改善，最最亲爱的。”

一回到城堡，方特勒罗伊就向祖父复述了母亲的话。

“她这么说时，我想到了您，”他最后说，“我告诉她，世界正在变得更美好，就是因为有您在，我要努力向您学习。”

“关于那一点，她说了些什么？”老伯爵有点不安地问道。

“她说，那是对的，我们应该经常去发现人们的好处，并且努力向他们看齐。”

也许正是因为老人记住了这话，有好多次，他的目光越过黑压压的人头，看着独自坐在一角的儿媳妇。他看见了那美丽的脸庞，那张脸是他不可原谅的儿子所深爱过的；他看见了那双眼睛，跟身边这孩子的眼睛是如此相像。但是谁也不知道他在想什么，以及他的想法到底是又硬又苦，还是有点儿柔和。

当他们走出教堂时，许多来参加礼拜仪式的人都站着，等着看他们走出去。当他们走近大门时，其中一个人手里拿着帽子，朝前跨出了一步，然后又踌躇不前了。他是一个中年农夫，脸上一副被忧虑折磨的样子。

“呃，希金斯。”老伯爵说。

方特勒罗伊迅速转过身，看着希金斯。

“哦！”他喊道，“这位就是希金斯先生吗？”

“是的。”老伯爵干巴巴地答道，“我猜想，他是来看看他的新主人的。”

“是的，老爷。”希金斯说，他那被太阳晒黑的脸泛起来红晕，“纽威克先生告诉我，小勋爵好心地为我说话，我想，我要说声谢谢，如果您允许的话。”

看到为他做了那么多事的竟然是一个单纯的小家伙，希金斯有点儿纳闷。此刻，小勋爵正抬着头站在那儿，就跟他自己家那些穷孩子似的——显而易见，塞德里克丝毫没有意识到自己的重要身份。

“多谢您，少爷。”他说，“多谢了，我——”

“哦，”方特勒罗伊说，“我只是写了一封信。真正帮助你的是我的祖父，不过你也知道他的为人，他一贯对所有人都很好。希金斯太太现在好些了吗？”

希金斯看上去有点儿吃惊。

“我——呃，是的，少爷。”他结结巴巴地说，“自从您驱除了我媳妇心中的烦恼，她变得好多了，是忧虑让她病倒的。”

“听你这么说，我很高兴。”方特勒罗伊说，“听说你的孩子们得了猩红热，我爷爷感到非常难过，我也是。他自己也有孩子。你知道，我就是他的儿子的孩子。”

希金斯几乎惶恐不安了。他觉得，不看伯爵会更安全些，更谨慎些。因为大家都知道，作为一个父亲，伯爵对他的儿子们的感情是怎么一回事。他每年大概看他们两次，他们生病的时候，他就匆匆忙忙地赶去伦敦，因为他觉得跟医生啊、护士啊待在一起，很烦心。

“你瞧，希金斯，”伯爵微微地狞笑着，插话道，“你们这些人都对我有误解，方特勒罗伊勋爵能理解我。关于我的性格问题，如果你想要得到可靠的信息，你该去请教他。上车吧，方特勒罗伊。”

方特勒罗伊跳入车中，马车沿着绿荫小径渐行渐远，甚至当马车绕过拐角，驶上公路时，伯爵还在狞笑着。





第八章　学习骑马


日子一天天地过去，多林考特伯爵脸上挂着狞笑已有很多次了。事实上，随着他跟他的孙子越来越相知，他脸上经常挂着这种笑容，以至于有时候几乎没有狞厉的性质了。不可否认的是，在方特勒罗伊勋爵到来之前，老人对自己的孤独、痛风和七十高龄感到越来越厌烦。过去的漫长人生激动人心、赏心悦目，现在让他独自坐着，一只脚搁在痛风凳上，尽管房间布置得精美无比，但他确实感到不舒服。他的情绪无从转移，只好突然地大发脾气、大声喊叫，弄得惊恐的仆人一见他就心生厌恶。老伯爵聪明反被聪明误，以至于他并不清楚他的仆人们讨厌他，纵然有人来拜访他，也不是因为爱他——尽管有人发现，他那些尖锐的、讽刺人的、得理不饶人的谈话中，也有些可笑的成分。过去他身体好，又有钱，他从一个地方漫游到另一个地方，尽管他并不真正喜欢这样，但他还是假装以此愉悦自己。当他的健康状况开始下降时，他变得对一切都感到厌烦，他把自己关在多林考特城堡里，只跟他的报刊、书籍和痛风在一起。但他又不能一直阅读，用他自己的话来说，他变得越来越“厌烦”了。他讨厌漫长的黑夜和白天，他变得越来越凶残、易怒。这时方特勒罗伊来了，当伯爵看到他时，他内心的傲慢一下就得到了满足，这对于小家伙来说，是很幸运的事。如果塞德里克长得不是那么漂亮，老人可能会非常不喜欢他，以至于不让自己有机会去发现孙子更好的品质。不过，他认为塞德里克的漂亮和无畏精神都是多林考特血统的遗传，并且是多林考特家族的荣耀。然后，他听孩子的谈吐，发现他是一个很有教养的孩子。尽管作为一个孩子，小家伙对他的新的地位及其意义一无所知，但他非常有教养，老伯爵更加喜欢孙子了，而且真正开始发现自己也从中得到了相当多的快乐。使他高兴的是，他把权力交到那双孩子的小手中，让孩子给可怜的希金斯施行恩德。老伯爵自己根本不关心可怜的希金斯，不过他想到了他的孙子尽管还很小，但是已经开始在仆人中有知名度了，而且村民们也乐于跟小家伙聊天，这使老伯爵感到些许高兴。和塞德里克一起乘车去教堂，看见他们到达时所引起的兴奋和兴趣，也使他感到满足。他知道人们是如何谈论小家伙的漂亮的，他们谈到了他那匀称、强健、笔直的小身体，也谈到了他挺拔的身材、漂亮的脸蛋、油亮的头发。伯爵还听一个女人对另一个女人说，这男孩身上处处都流露着贵族气。多林考特老爷是一个自负的老人，为自己的名号而自豪，也为自己的头衔而骄傲，因此他会傲慢地向全世界宣告，多林考特家族终于得到了一个继承人，一个值得担当伯爵爵位的继承人。

一天上午，塞德里克试骑他新得到的小马驹，伯爵是如此高兴，以至于几乎忘掉了痛风。当马车夫将漂亮的小马驹牵出来时，小马驹弯垂着光滑的棕色脖子，在阳光中抬起俊俏的头颅。伯爵坐在书房打开的窗户旁，看着方特勒罗伊上第一节骑马课。他想知道，这男孩会不会表现出胆怯来。这不是一匹很小的马驹。他经常看到孩子们在开始学骑马的时候，就失去了勇气。

方特勒罗伊兴高采烈地上了马，他以前从未骑过马，所以兴致高极了。在书房的窗前，马夫威尔金斯一上一下地控制着马的缰绳。

“他是一个胆大心细的孩子。”威尔金斯事后在马圈里大笑着说，“我不费什么力就把他扶了上去，当他坐起来时，一个老手都不会坐得那样笔直。他说——他对我说，‘威尔金斯我坐得直吗？他们在马戏团里的都坐得很直。’我说，‘像箭一样直，少爷！’——他大笑着，高兴得不能再高兴了。他说：‘好的，如果我坐得不直，你就告诉我，威尔金斯。’”

但是在马背上坐得直直的，让马夫牵着走路，不能使塞德里克完全满意。几分钟后，他对祖父说——老头儿正从窗户里看着他呢。

“能不能让我自己来？”他问道，“能不能让我骑得更快些？第五大道上的那个小男孩经常让马小跑！”

“你觉得你能让马慢跑吗？”伯爵说。

“我想试试看。”方特勒罗伊答道。

老爷给威尔金斯使了个信号，后者立即牵过自己的马来，翻身上去，然后牵着小马驹的缰绳。

“好，”伯爵说，“让它小跑吧。”

接下来的几分钟，小骑手感到相当激动。他发现，小跑并不像走那样轻松，小马驹跑得越快，他骑得就越不容易。

“它颠……颠得好……好……厉……厉……害……是……是吗？”方特勒罗伊对威尔金斯说，“它……它……也颠……颠……你……你吗？”

“不颠。少爷。”威尔金斯答道，“到时你会习惯的。身子在马鞍里起来一些。”

“我的身……身体一直在往上……上颠。”方特勒罗伊说。

他的身体一会儿上，一会儿下，左右摇晃着，来回弹动着，相当不舒服。最后他上气不接下气了，脸也变得通红了，但是竭尽全力坚持着，尽可能地坐直。伯爵能从窗户里看到这一切。有几分钟马和人都被树木挡住了。当他们回到他能听见他们说话的距离时，方特勒罗伊的帽子已经掉了，脸颊红得像芙蓉花似的，嘴唇则像被固定住了似的。但是他仍然英武地让马小跑着。

“停一会儿！”他祖父说，“你的帽子呢？”

威尔金斯碰了碰自己的帽子，“它掉了，老爷，”他掩饰不住自己的高兴，说道，“要我停下来去拾帽子吗，老爷？”

“他不太害怕，是吗？”伯爵干巴巴地说。

“哦，老爷！”威尔金斯喊道，“我不应该这么说，因为他知道骑马是怎么一回事。我以前也教过其他小绅士骑马，我从未见过比他更意志坚定的了。”

“累吗？”伯爵对方特勒罗伊说，“想下来吗？”

“您想象不到，它颠得我有多厉害，”小勋爵坦白地承认道，“我也有点儿累了，可是我不想下来，我想继续学。一等我喘气定缓了，我就会回去找帽子。”

方特勒罗伊的话在老人心中产生了极好的效果。如果让世界上最聪明的人来教导方特勒罗伊，教他如何去讨好那个看着他的老头，也教不出比这话更有效的了。当小马驹再一次向着大路小跑而去时，一种淡淡的色泽爬上了老人那凶相的脸庞。在他浓粗的眉毛下，双眼闪烁着快乐的光芒。他坐着，看着，非常焦躁不安，直到马蹄声逐渐靠近。过了一阵子，他们就来了，快要到达时，马跑得更快了。方特勒罗伊的帽子仍然不在头上，威尔金斯帮他拿着呢，他的脸颊比刚才更红了，头发在耳朵边飘着，但他还是让马小跑着来到窗前。

“在那儿，”当他们停下来时，他大喊着，“我让马慢跑。我做得没有第五大道上的男孩那么好，但是我做到了，而且我没有摔下来！”

他、威尔金斯和小马驹打那以后成了亲密的朋友，村民们没有一天不见他们一起出来，在大路上或在绿荫小径上，快乐地慢跑着。棚屋里的孩子们纷纷跑到门口，看着那匹骄傲的棕色小马驹，以及那个勇敢的坐在马鞍上的小家伙，他会把帽子抓下来，向着他们挥舞着，喊道：“喂！上午好！”他喊得真心诚意，一点都没有勋爵的架子。有时候，他会停下来，跟小伙伴们一起聊天。有一回，当他们回到城堡后，威尔金斯跟人说，在村里的学校附近，方特勒罗伊坚持不肯上马，要让一个小男孩骑着他的马回家，因为那个男孩又瘸又累。

“哎哟！我的天哪！”威尔金斯在马圈里叙述故事时说，“我的天哪！他还不让我下马，他说，因为让一个男孩骑大马，可能会感到不舒服。他还说：‘威尔金斯，那个男孩的腿瘸了，而我好好的，而且我还想去跟他谈谈。’那个男孩不得不上了马，然后小勋爵步履艰难地走在他身边，双手插在衣兜里，帽子戴在后脑勺上，一边轻松地吹着口哨，一边高兴地闲聊着。当我们到达那个男孩的家时，他母亲以为出什么事了，赶紧跑出来看个究竟。小勋爵摘下帽子，说：‘我把您的孩子带回来了，太太。因为他的腿受伤了，而我觉得那根拐棍根本不够用，我要去请求我爷爷叫人为他做一副拐杖。’”

威尔金斯曾害怕伯爵听说了这事会大发雷霆，但伯爵并没有发怒，相反，他放声笑了，他把方特勒罗伊叫去，让他把事情从头到尾原原本本地说出来，听了以后他又笑了。几天后，在瘸腿小男孩家门前的绿荫小径上，多林考特家的马车停在了那儿。方特勒罗伊跳了出来，走到门口，手里果然拿了一副拐杖，这副新拐杖又轻便又结实，扛在肩膀上就像一把枪。他把拐杖送给了哈特尔太太（瘸腿男孩的名字就叫哈特尔），并说：“这是我爷爷的赠品，给您的孩子的，请您笑纳，我们希望他会好起来。”

“我说是您的赠品，”他回到马车里时，向伯爵解释道，“您没有跟我说过，但我想，也许您忘记了，就是那么回事，对吗？”

伯爵又笑了，没有说不是这么回事。事实上，他们俩日益亲密了，方特勒罗伊对他爷爷的仁慈和美德的信任也与日俱增。他毫不怀疑他祖父是老年绅士中最最和蔼、最最大方的。当然了，他自己发现，他的愿望几乎还没有说出口，往往就得到了满足。这类礼物和快乐泛滥在他面前，有时候他几乎因为自己能拥有这么多而迷惑了。显而易见，他想要什么就能得到什么，他想做什么就能去做。

尽管跟所有的小男孩相互攀比，肯定是不明智，但小勋爵处理得非常好。也许是这么回事：虽然他天性善良，但是，假如他不是每天有几个小时跟母亲一起待在罗奇苑，他可能就有点儿被宠坏了。那个“最好的朋友”常常凑近了温和地看着他，母子俩有过许多次长谈。在他要回到城堡去的时候，母亲会亲吻他的脸颊，说一些淳朴但值得他记在心里的叮嘱。

有一件事真让小家伙困惑不堪。任何人都想不到，他会那么经常地思索这件事的神秘性，甚至于他母亲都不知道，他到底花了多少时间来苦思冥想。好长时间以来，伯爵一点儿都没有觉察到他的想法。但是，小男孩敏于观察，他早已注意到，他母亲和祖父似乎从不见面，他禁不住想知道为什么。当多林考特的马车停靠在罗奇苑时，伯爵从来不下车。偶然地，方特勒罗伊和祖父一起去教堂，伯爵总是让他在门口单独和他母亲谈话，或者让他跟母亲一起回家去。但是每天都有人将水果和花朵从城堡的温室里拿出来，送到罗奇苑去。不过，伯爵后来做了一个善举，使他的形象在塞德里克的眼中，达到了完美的顶点。大约一个礼拜后的一天，塞德里克去拜访母亲时，他发现，门口有一辆漂亮的小马车，还有一匹栗色的骏马，而平常那儿都停着一辆大型马车，站着两匹烈马。

“那是你给你母亲的礼物，”伯爵直率地说，“她不能在乡村里到处步行，她需要一辆马车。驾驶马车的仆人会负责此事。这是你送给她的礼物。”

方特勒罗伊此时喜悦的心情无法用语言来表达。在去罗奇苑的路上，他几乎不能自制。他母亲正在花园里采集玫瑰花，他冲出小马车，向她飞跑过去。

“最最亲爱的！”他喊道，“你相信吗？这是给你的！爷爷说这是我给你的礼物，这是你自己的马车，你可以乘着它到各处去！”

他是如此高兴，以至于她不知道该说些什么。纵然她知道，马车来自那个决定把她看成仇敌的老人，但她不忍心扼杀孩子的快乐、拒绝接受这礼物。她不得不带着玫瑰和身边所有的东西，走进车里，任凭自己被车载着。一路上，方特勒罗伊告诉她，有关他祖父善良与和蔼的故事。这些故事是如此天真，以至于有时候她会禁不住笑一笑，然后她会把小男孩更近地拉向她身边，吻着他。那个老人几乎没有朋友，而方特勒罗伊却只看到他身上的好处，这使她感到高兴。

就在第二天，方特勒罗伊给霍布斯先生写了一封信。信写得很长。第一遍抄写完后，他拿着去让祖父检查。

“因为，”他说，“因为在拼写方面，我实在拿不准。如果你告诉我错在哪儿，我会把它重写一遍。”

下面就是他写的信：





亲爱的霍布斯先生，我想把我祖父的事告诉你。他是你所见过的最好的伯爵。说伯爵是暴君的看法是错误的，我祖父根本不是暴君。我希望你能认识他，你们会成为好朋友的，我相信，你们会的。他的一只脚得了痛风病，很受罪，但是他很有忍耐力。我爱他，一天更比一天多。他对这世界上所有的人都很友好，像他这样的伯爵，你会情不自禁地爱上他的。我希望你能跟他谈一谈，他知道这世界上的一切事物。你可以问他任何问题。不过，他从未玩过棒球。他给了我一匹小马驹和一辆小马车，给了我妈妈一辆漂亮的马车。我有三间屋子，有各种各样的玩具，你见了会感到惊讶的。你会喜欢城堡和庄园的。城堡很大很大，威尔金斯说，你可能会在城堡里迷路的。威尔金斯是我的马夫，他说，城堡下面，有一个地牢。庄园里的每一样东西都很美丽，都会使你惊讶的。庄园里有大树、麋鹿、兔子和猎物，它们在隐蔽处到处瞎跑。我祖父很富有，您觉得伯爵们都是很傲慢的，但他并不目中无人。我喜欢跟他在一起。这里的人们很友好，很讲礼貌，男人会向你行脱帽礼，女人会向你行屈膝礼，有时候还会说：“上帝保佑你。”我现在会骑马了，不过一开始，当我让马小跑的时候，它颠得很厉害。有一个贫穷的佃户付不起租金的时候，我祖父让他继续留在农场里，梅隆夫人还给他生病的孩子们拿去了药酒等东西。我想见到你，我希望最最亲爱的能住在城堡里。不过，我不太思念她的时候，我过得很快乐。我爱我祖父，大家都爱他，请你早点儿给我回信。

你亲爱的老朋友

塞德里克·埃罗尔

附言：地牢里没有人，我祖父从来不曾将任何人长期关在那儿。

又及：他真的很好，他让我想起了你，他非常讨人喜欢。





“你很想念你母亲吗？”伯爵看完信时，问道。

“是的。”方特勒罗伊说，“我一直在想念她。”

方特勒罗伊走过去，站在伯爵面前，把手放在他膝盖上，抬头看着他。

“您不想念她，是吗？”他说。

“我不认识她。”老伯爵相当粗鲁地答道。

“我知道您不认识她，”方特勒罗伊说，“就是那一点使我感到迷惑不解。她告诉我不要问您任何问题，所以——所以我没问，可是有时候我禁不住要想这问题，您知道，这使我困惑不已。不过我还是不想问您任何问题。我实在想她的时候，就望着窗外，每天晚上，我都能看见，她的光辉透过树林中的空地向我照来。我和她相隔很远，但是天一变黑，她就把她的光辉照在窗户上，我能看见那光辉在远方闪烁，而且我知道它在说什么。”

“说的是什么？”

“说的是：‘晚安，愿上帝整个晚上保佑你！’——就是我们在一起的时候，她常常说的那些话。她每天晚上都会那么说，而每天早上她说：‘愿上帝整天保佑你！’您瞧，这样我就一直很安全——”

“是很安全，我毫不怀疑。”老伯爵干巴巴地说。他垂下突出的浓眉，盯着这小男孩，看了很长时间，以至于方特勒罗伊很想知道：他可能在想什么呢？





第九章　简陋的农舍


实际上，在那些天里，多林考特伯爵老爷想到了以前他从未想过的一些事，所有这些念头或多或少都跟他的孙子有关。傲慢是他本性中最突出的部分，小男孩在每一点上都使他感到满意。通过这傲慢，他开始找到了新的人生乐趣，他开始向全世界展示他的继承人，并从中得到快乐。人们都知道他对他的儿子们很失望，而方特勒罗伊不会让任何人失望，所以当他向人们展示这新来的方特勒罗伊勋爵时，他有一种赏心悦目的胜利之感。他希望孩子能欣赏他自己的权力，懂得他显赫的地位。他也希望别的人能意识到这一点。他为孩子的未来制订了计划。

有时候，暗地里，他的确发现，自己但愿过去的人生应该更好一些，而现在，如果孩子那纯洁的心灵知道了他过去人生的真相，就可能会跟他保持距离，从而使他目前的日子比过去更差。好多年来，塞德里克的祖父一直被人们称为“歹毒的多林考特伯爵”，如果不小心让他知道了这一点，他那漂亮而单纯的小脸蛋不知道会如何变色。想到这问题，伯爵就感到不舒服，甚至使他的神经感到有点儿紧张。他不希望男孩知道真相。有时候，这种新的人生乐趣使他忘掉了痛风。一段时间后，他的医生惊奇地发现，这位高贵的病人的健康状况变得越来越好了，比他预料的不知道要好多少。也许伯爵的身体之所以变好，是因为他觉得并不像以前那样度日如年了，除了病痛和虚弱之外，他还想到了一些别的事。

一个晴朗的上午，人们惊奇地看到，方特勒罗伊勋爵骑着他的小马驹，身边除了威尔金斯外，还有一位伙伴。这位新伙伴骑着一匹灰色的高头大马，他不是别人，正是伯爵本人。实际上，方特勒罗伊早就建议伯爵跟他一起骑马。在他正待跨上马背的时候，他满怀渴望地跟他祖父说：

“我希望您能跟我一起骑马。当我骑马出去时，我感到孤单，因为您把自己留在了这么大的城堡里。我希望您也来骑马。”

几分钟后，伯爵传来命令，要马夫为他给那匹叫塞利姆的马上好鞍子，这命令使马圈里的人们激动不已。打那以后，塞利姆几乎每天都要上鞍出行。慢慢地，人们就习惯于看到：那匹灰色的高头大马驮着一个老头。那老头头发灰白，个子高大，一张鹰脸英俊而又冷酷。他旁边就是方特勒罗伊勋爵，正骑着那匹棕色的小马驹。他们俩并辔而行，穿过绿荫小径和美丽的乡道，变得比以往任何时候都更加亲密。渐渐地，老人听说了许多关于“最最亲爱的”的事。当小马在大马旁边小跑的时候，方特勒罗伊会高兴地说个不停，他的内心是如此快乐，不可能有哪个小伙伴比他更欢快了。跟人在一起时，总是他说得最多。伯爵往往沉默着，听着，看着那张欢乐的、闪光的小脸蛋。有时候，他会告诉他的小伴侣，抽一鞭子，让马跑起来。小马驹冲出去时，小家伙坐得直直的，毫不畏惧。伯爵看着小男孩，眼中闪耀着骄傲而快乐的光芒。这样猛跑一阵后，方特勒罗伊方往回赶，大声喊着、笑着，挥舞着他的帽子，总感到他跟他祖父是真正的好朋友。

伯爵发现，他的儿媳妇并不是无所事事地混日子。不久，他就听说穷人们跟她很熟悉。哪家有人生病了，或悲伤了或穷困了，她的小马车都会停在那家的门口。

“您知道吗，”有一回方特勒罗伊说，“他们见到她时，都会说，‘上帝保佑你！’孩子们一见她就高兴起来。有人还到她的住处去跟她学裁缝呢。她说她现在感到自己很富有，所以她想帮助穷人。”

伯爵发现：他的继承人的母亲有着年轻而漂亮的脸庞，看上去很像贵妇，就好像她本来就是一位女公爵似的，这并没有使他不高兴，其中一个原因是，他明白穷人们都知道她，都爱戴她。但是当他看到，她的形象是如何充满了孩子的心灵，孩子又是如何依赖于她，把她看成最亲的亲人时，他往往感到一阵强烈的、嫉妒的剧痛。老人本来期望，他在孩子的心目中是第一位的，没有任何对手。

就在那天上午，他们在一片荒野里骑马，一道风景在他们面前展开，宽广而美丽。伯爵把马牵到一块高地上，用鞭子做了个手势。

“整个那块地都是属于我的，你知道吗？”他对方特勒罗伊说。

“是吗？”方特勒罗伊答道，“一个人拥有这么多地，真是太美了。”

“有朝一日，这一切全部会属于你——那块地和许多其他的东西，你知道吗？”

“属于我！”方特勒罗伊以畏惧的声音惊呼道，“什么时候？”

“我死的时候。”他的祖父答道。

“那我不想要，”方特勒罗伊说，“我要您永远活着。”

“那样当然好。”伯爵干巴巴地答道，“不过，有朝一日，这一切都会是你的——有朝一日，你将成为多林考特伯爵。”

有几分钟时间，方特勒罗伊勋爵很安静地坐在马鞍里。他望着宽广的荒野、碧绿的农田、漂亮的灌木、路边的农舍、美丽的村庄，还有树林以及那矗立在林中的城堡和塔楼，庞大的城堡灰暗而庄严。这时他奇怪地微微叹了一口气。

“你在想什么呢？”伯爵问道。

“我在想，”方特勒罗伊答道，“我是个什么样的孩子！还有最最亲爱的跟我说过的话。”

“她说过什么？”伯爵问道。

“她说，要想很富有，也许不太容易。如果一个人一直拥有这么多东西，有时候她就可能会忘记：并不是所有的人都这么幸运。她还说，富人应该永远关心别人，记住别人的不幸。当我跟她说您很好时，她说，这是好事，因为伯爵权力很大，如果他只关心自己的快乐，从不为别人着想，在能够帮助别人的时候，不去帮助他们，他们就可能会遇到麻烦——他们人很多，都靠他的土地生活，该有多么艰难啊！刚才我在看所有那些房子，我在想，当我是伯爵的时候，我该如何去发现他们的生活实况。您是如何发现的呢？”

这是个很难回答的问题，因为老爷对佃户的了解，只局限于弄明白谁爽快地先交了租金，谁因拒不交纳而被开除。“纽威克会帮我弄明白的。”他说着，捋了捋他那灰白的大胡子，很不安地看着眼前向他提问的孙子。“现在咱俩回家吧。”他又说，“当你是伯爵的时候，你会明白，你是一个比我更好的伯爵！”

在他们往回骑的路上，伯爵沉默不语。他生平从未真正爱过任何人，却发现小家伙居然如此喜欢自己——一点儿都没有怀疑，他感到，这简直让人难以置信。一开始，他只是喜欢塞德里克的漂亮和勇敢，并为之感到骄傲，但是现在，在他的感觉中，不仅仅只有骄傲。有时候，当他想到，他是多么喜欢让小男孩待在自己身边，多么喜欢听见他的声音，在暗地里又是多么真切地希望小孙子能喜欢自己、敬重自己，他就会对着自己一个人大笑一阵，笑声狞厉而干枯。

“我老了，老糊涂了，除了这孙子，别的什么也不想了。”他自言自语道。但是他也知道，事实并非如此，如果他允许自己承认事实，他也许早就发现，自己不得不去拥有那些吸引他的品质——坦率、真诚、仁慈、可信的情意。尽管实际上，他从未真正拥有这些品质，但他永远不会把这些看作是丑恶的品质。

那次骑马出行后大约仅仅一个礼拜，方特勒罗伊看望母亲后，回到了书房里，带着满脸的烦恼和思虑。他坐在高背椅子里，初来的那天晚上，他坐的也是这把椅子。他看着壁炉里的余烬，看了好一阵子。伯爵默默地看着他，不知道发生什么事了。显而易见，塞德里克心头有事，最后他抬起来头，问道：“纽威克了解他们所有的情况吗？”

“去了解他们就是他的业务。”老伯爵说，“他不上心——是吗？”

两人之间看上去似乎有矛盾，但小家伙对佃户们的兴趣很大，似乎没有什么比这更使他感到快乐，并受到教益了。他自己对他们从未有过任何兴趣，但是小家伙的想法使他非常高兴，这些想法里有种种非常孩子气的习惯成分。小家伙游玩起来兴致很高，还是很孩子气，但在他的鬈毛头里，却冒出来这么古怪而又严肃的想法。

“有一个地方，”方特勒罗伊说，他抬头看着伯爵，眼睛瞪得大大的，充满惶恐，“最最亲爱的见过那地方，它在村子的另一头。那里的房子互相挨得很近，几乎要倒塌了。看到那样子，你几乎不敢呼吸。村民们都很穷，一切都很可怕！他们还经常得热病，孩子们一得病就会死掉。他们过着那样贫穷、那样悲惨的日子，真叫遭罪啊！甚至比迈可尔和布里奇特更糟糕！他们的屋顶还漏雨呢！最最亲爱的去看望一个住在那儿的穷女人，回来后她不让我靠近她，直到她换掉了里外所有衣服。当她跟我说这些的时候，眼泪流到了她的下巴！”

小家伙自己的眼睛里也流出了眼泪，但他还是含泪笑着。

“我告诉她，您不知道这些情况，我会来告诉您的。”他说。他跳下椅子，走到伯爵跟前，身子靠着伯爵坐的椅子。“您能改善这一切，”他说，“就像您改善希金斯的状况一样。您一直在为所有的人改善条件。我告诉她您是愿意行善的，只不过纽威克忘了把这事告诉您。”

伯爵低头看着那只放在他膝盖上的小手。事实上，纽威克并没有忘记告诉他。纽威克不止一次告诉他，村子那头叫作伯爵苑的地方，情况非常危急。他知道所有这一切：摇摇欲坠的、悲惨的农舍，堵塞的下水道，潮湿的墙壁，破碎的窗户，有裂缝的屋顶，以及所有的穷困、热病和惨境。莫当特先生跟他说时，添油加醋，用了他所能用的最最强烈的词语，但老伯爵回以激烈的措辞。当他的痛风最厉害时，他甚至说，伯爵苑的人死得越早越好，教区长把他们埋葬得越快越好——那样事情才能了结。可是当他看着膝盖上的小手时，当他的目光从那只小手移到那张诚实的、认真的小脸以及那双坦率的眼睛时，他真正地为伯爵苑和他自己而感到羞愧了。

“什么？！”他说，“你想要把我变成泥瓦匠，去修建模范农舍，是吗？”他主动把自己的手放在孩子的手上，抚摩着。

“那些房子得推倒，”方特勒罗伊万分焦急地说，“最最亲爱的是这么说的。我们——我们明天就去找人推倒它们。村民们如果见到您去了，该有多高兴啊！他们将知道您是去帮助他们的！”他的双眼像星星似的闪耀着，小脸蛋也发出了红光。

伯爵从椅子里站了起来，把手搁在孩子的肩膀上。“咱俩出去，到台地上去走走，”他笑了笑，说，“我们会把这事解决的。”

几乎每个晴朗的傍晚，他们都要一起在宽阔的石头台地上散步。两人来回漫步时，伯爵干笑了几下，他似乎想到了一件使他愉快的事，而他的手一直搁在那小伙伴的肩膀上。





第十章　伯爵惊慌了


从荒野的边上看这小村子，它显得风景如画，但是村民们都很贫穷。埃罗尔夫人在他们中间开展工作的过程中，也发现了许许多多伤感的事。一旦近看时，所有东西都不像远看时那样美丽如画了。她发现村民们都很懒散、贫穷而又无知，他们应该是勤奋的、舒服的。经过了一段时间后，她发现，在那一带乡间，额勒波罗村被认为是最糟糕的。莫当特先生告诉她许许多多的困难和让他沮丧的事情，她自己也发现了许多。伯爵总是挑选那些会讨好自己的人当代理人，这些人负责管理田产，但根本不关心贫穷佃户的潦倒和悲惨生活。许多事情本来应该被注意的，却被忽略了，于是越变越糟糕。

一说到伯爵苑，就得替伯爵感到丢脸。农舍都破败不堪，村民们过着悲惨的、病苦的日子。埃罗尔夫人初次去那儿时，惨境都使她发颤了。在乡间，这样的丑陋、邋遢和贫乏比在城市里显得更加糟糕。不过情况看上去还有救。当她看着那些肮脏的、没有得到照顾的孩子，看着他们在邪恶、野蛮、冷漠中生长，她想起了她自己的孩子。此刻方特勒罗伊正生活在那宏大的、壮观的城堡里，像一个小王子，被保护着、被伺候着，没有一个愿望不得到满足，他只知道讲究、轻松和漂亮。想到此，一个大胆的设想萌生在小母亲那颗明智的心中。慢慢地，跟别人一样，她也开始注意到，她的孩子运气不错，能使伯爵心花怒放。他要是提出什么愿望，伯爵几乎从未拒绝过。

“伯爵愿意给他任何东西。”她对莫当特先生说，“他愿意纵容孩子的所有奇思怪想。难道我们不应该用这种纵容为别人谋福利吗？我觉得这一招会有效的。”

她自己相信孩子的心肠是很好的，因此她把伯爵苑的情形告诉了小家伙，确信他会去跟他祖父说的。她希望接下来会出现一些好的结果。

好结果果然出现了，大家都觉得挺奇怪的。

事实证明，影响伯爵的最强大的力量是孙子对他的绝对信赖——事实上，塞德里克总是相信，只要是正确的、大方的事，他祖父就会去做。伯爵不太能够铁下心来，让孙子发现：他其实没有一点儿大方的倾向，在所有的事情上，无论是正确的，还是错误的，他都要自行其是。他已经完全学会了如何去喜欢那个小男孩，去喜欢他那头金黄的、可爱的乱发。他感到，自己宁愿不时地委屈自己，去采取与人为善的行动。因此——尽管他嘲笑着自己——他沉思一阵后，还是派人把纽威克喊了来，就伯爵苑的事，专门跟他进行了一次长谈，最后做出决定，那些破败的旧房子应该推倒，应该建筑新房子。

“是方特勒罗伊勋爵坚持要求这么办的。”伯爵干巴巴地说，“他认为那样会改善村民们的穷困处境。你可以告诉佃户们，这是小勋爵的主意。”他低头看着小勋爵。塞德里克躺在炉边地毯上，正在跟杜格尔玩呢。杜格尔是孩子恒久的伴侣，无论他到那儿，它都跟着。当他散步时，它会在他身后，一本正经地跟随着；当他骑马或乘车时，它会昂首挺胸地小跑。

村里的和镇上的人们当然都听说了这个改善的计划。一开始，他们中的许多人都不相信，但是，当一小队工匠到达时，当工匠们开始推倒那些破烂的、摇摇欲坠的农舍时，人们开始明白，方特勒罗伊勋爵又一次使他们的生活好转了。因为他天真的介入，关于伯爵苑的流言终于破除了。如果他知道人们如何到处谈论他、赞扬他，并且预言他长大后将前途无量，那么他肯定会惊诧不已！但是他从未那么想过。他照样过着单纯的、快乐的孩童生活，在园林里欢快地跑来跑去，追逐着兔子，直到把它们追到洞穴里。有时候，他躺在树荫下、草地上或者书房的小地毯上，阅读美妙的书籍，然后跟祖父谈论书中的内容，再把书中的故事讲给母亲听。有时候，他给迪克和霍布斯先生写长长的信，他们俩回信的形式都很独特。有时候，他骑马出去，或者跟祖父并辔而行，或者由威尔金斯作陪。当他们骑马穿过集市时，他常常看到人们转过身来看他们。他还注意到，当他们举起帽子时，脸上总是泛着快乐，不过，在他看来，那全是因为有祖父在身边的缘故。

“他们多喜欢您啊！”有一回他抬头看着伯爵，快乐地笑着说，“他们看见您时，是多么高兴啊，您发现了吗？我希望有朝一日，他们也会这样地喜欢我。大家都喜欢您，感觉肯定很好。”他爷爷深受人们仰慕和爱戴，作为孙子，他感到很骄傲。

在新农舍修建过程中，方特勒罗伊对此和他祖父经常一起骑马到伯爵苑去，看着工匠们干活。方特勒罗伊满怀兴趣，他会跳下小马驹，去结识工匠们，问他们有关建筑和砌砖的问题，告诉他们有关美国的事情。经过这样的两三次谈话后，当他们骑马回家时，他就能给祖父讲解有关砌砖的知识。

“我一直喜欢了解诸如此类的事情，”他说，“因为您永远无从知道您会碰上什么问题。”

当他离开那些工匠时，他们经常互相谈论他，嘲笑他那些好笑的天真的谈话。但他们是喜欢他的，喜欢看着他站在他们中间，不断地说啊说。他惯常把手插在衣兜里，帽子推到鬈毛头的后脑勺上，小脸蛋充满着渴望。“他是一个罕见的孩子，”他们常常说，“也是一个有话就说的好孩子，他身上没什么坏血统。”他们回家后，就把他的情况告诉他们的妻子，他们的妻子又相互传言，到最后几乎所有的人都在谈论他，都知道小方特勒罗伊勋爵的几个故事了。渐渐地，几乎所有的人都知道，那个“邪恶的伯爵”晚年居然找到了一件让他关心的事——这事感动了甚至温暖了他那颗冷硬、痛苦、衰老的心。

但是没有人清楚，这颗心被温暖到了何种程度，也没有人清楚，老人如何一天更比一天地发现自己越来越关心这孩子了。在他的一生中，只有这孩子信任他。他发现自己在盼望，有朝一日，塞德里克会成为一个强壮而英俊的青年，生机勃勃地出现在他面前，但是仍然拥有那颗善良的心，以及到处跟人交朋友的能力。伯爵想知道孩子将来愿意干什么，以及他将如何运用他的天赋。当他看着小家伙躺在炉边地毯上，捧着一本大部头书在书海里遨游，那年幼的明亮的脑袋闪闪发光时，伯爵那双老眼也经常会放出光来，脸颊也会泛起红晕。

“这孩子能做任何事，”他自言自语道，“任何事！”

他从未跟任何别人谈过他对塞德里克的感觉。当他跟别人谈起塞德的时候，脸上总是挂着同样狞厉的笑容。但是方特勒罗伊很快就知道，他祖父是爱他的，总是喜欢他在身边——如果他俩在书房里，就让他靠近他的椅子；吃饭时，就让他坐在桌子的对面；骑马或乘车或在宽阔的台地上散步时，就让他紧挨着自己。

“您还记得吗？”有一回，塞德里克躺在炉边地毯上，目光从书本上抬起来，说，“我到这儿来的第一个晚上，关于我俩要成为好伙伴，我说了些什么，您还记得吗？我觉得，任何人都不能成为比我俩更好的朋友了，你觉得呢？”

“我应该说，我俩是非常好的好朋友，”伯爵答道，“到这边来。”

方特勒罗伊爬起来，到他那边去。

“你要点什么吗？”伯爵问道，“你缺点什么吗？”

小家伙褐色的双眼盯着祖父，目光中充满渴望。

“只要一样东西。”他答道。

“是什么？”伯爵询问道。

方特勒罗伊沉默了一会儿。他从来不曾自己琢磨过事情，因此琢磨了老半天，还是没有结果。

“到底是什么？”老爷又问道。

方特勒罗伊回答了。

“是最最亲爱的事。”他说。

老伯爵脸上的肌肉扭曲了一下。

“可是你几乎每天都能见到到她，”他说，“那还不够吗？”

“我以前是整日整夜都能见她的，”方特勒罗伊说，“夜里，我入睡的时候，她常常吻着我；早上，我醒过来时，她总是在我身边。我们有什么事要告诉对方，不需要等待。”

两人同时沉默了，就在那一刹那间，年老的和年幼的同时把目光射入对方的眼中。随后，伯爵紧锁起了双眉。

“你从来没有忘记过你母亲吗？”他说。

“没有过。”方特勒罗伊答道，“从来没有过，她也从未忘记过我。如果我不跟您生活在一起了，我也不应该忘记您，您知道，我会永远思念您的。”

“哎呀，”伯爵看了他一会儿，说道，“我相信，你会的！”

当男孩那样说起他母亲时，嫉妒的惨痛又出现了，而且似乎比以前更加剧烈——之所以更加剧烈，是因为老头更加喜爱这男孩了。

可是不久，他又有了新的创痛，这创痛是如此剧烈，以至于当时他几乎忘记了他曾恨过儿媳妇。这创痛来得极其奇怪。就在伯爵苑将要竣工的一天晚上，多林考特举办了一场盛大的宴会。城堡已经有很长时间没有举办过这样盛大的宴会了。宴会前几天，哈里·洛里耶尔爵士和洛里耶尔夫人也来参观，夫人是伯爵唯一的姐姐——他们的到来在村子里引起了极大的兴奋，也使迪布尔太太商店里的铃铛又一次疯狂地响了起来，因为大家都知道，自从三十五年前出嫁以来，洛里耶尔夫人只回来过一次。她是位很有风韵的老女士，鬈发全白了，漂亮的双颊上长着酒窝。她好得像金子一样，但像世上所有其他人一样，她从未喜欢过她弟弟。她有独立自主的坚强意志，根本不怕直率地说出自己的想法。她跟伯爵大吵过几架。从她年轻时候起，就不把她弟弟放在眼里了。

在所有那些分开的年头里，她听说了许多有关她弟弟的坏事。她听说，他对他妻子很漠视，甚至不关心那位可怜的夫人的死活；她还听说，他对孩子们也是漠不关心，那两个大一点儿的男孩子——贝维斯和莫里斯，既虚弱又邪恶，非常让人讨厌，他或其他任何人都不曾以他们俩为荣耀。她从未见过他们。倒是有一回，一个年轻人来到洛里耶尔庄园，他高大、健壮而又英俊，大约有十八岁，他告诉她说，他是她的侄子塞德里克·埃罗尔。他之所以来拜望她，是因为他曾听母亲说起过康斯坦蒂娅姑姑，这回正好路过庄园，想来看看她。一见这年轻人，洛里耶尔夫人那颗善良的心就暖透了。她让他跟她在一起待了一个星期，她非常宠爱他，看重他，欣赏他。年轻人的脾气是如此温和，心态是如此轻松，精神是如此饱满，以至于当他离开时，她希望能再见到他，能经常见到他。但是后来她从未再见他，因为当他回到多林考特时，正值伯爵的坏脾气发作，伯爵禁止他再去洛里耶尔庄园。但是洛里耶尔夫人一直温柔地惦记着他；尽管他在美国匆匆结婚使她感到害怕，但当她听说他父亲跟他断绝了父子关系，以致谁也不能真正知道他住在哪儿，过得怎么样时，她对伯爵的做法非常愤怒。最后传来关于他猝死的流言，接着贝维斯从马上摔下来，也死了，再接着莫里斯在罗马死于热病。不久又传来了美国孩子的事，说他将被找着了，将作为方特勒罗伊勋爵，被带回庄园。

“这孩子可能像其他孩子一样，也会被折磨死的，”她对她丈夫说：“除非他母亲是一个大好人，而且意志坚定，能独立自主地照顾他。”

但当她听说塞德里克的母亲被隔离开时，她几乎愤怒得连话都说不出来了。

“这真叫丢脸，哈里！”她说，“你想想，要让年纪这么小的孩子跟她母亲分开，跟像我弟弟那样的老头做伴！老伯爵要么蛮横地对待那个男孩，要么溺爱他，直到使他成为一个小怪物。我在想，我写封信过去，是否会有点用处——”

“不会有用的。”哈里说。

“我知道没用。”她答道，“我太了解多林考特的那个伯爵了，可是这事太让人气愤了。”

不仅仅穷人和农夫们听说过小方特勒罗伊勋爵，其他人也听说了他。他是如此多地被人们谈说，关于他又有如此多的故事——关于他的漂亮、他温和的脾气、他的知名度、他对伯爵越来越强的影响——关于他的流言也传到了乡绅们的耳朵里，在英国，不止一个郡的人们都在谈论他。人们在吃饭的时候谈论他，女士们可怜他年轻的母亲，想知道这男孩是否真像传闻的那么漂亮，男人们则为小家伙感到好笑，因为他们都知道伯爵和他的习性，而他居然相信老伯爵是和蔼可亲的。有一天，托马斯·阿什爵士在额勒波罗遇到了伯爵和他的孙子，他们正在一起骑马。他停下来，跟老爷握手，祝贺他气色的好转和痛风的恢复。“你知道吗？”事后，当他谈起这次巧遇时说，“老人看上去骄傲得像一只雄火鸡。比他的孙子更漂亮、更文雅的孩子，我从未见过！那孩子像支箭一样，直直地坐在小马驹上，简直就是一个小壮士！”

就这样，慢慢地，洛里耶尔夫人也听说那孩子了。她听说了希金斯的事，瘸腿男孩的事，伯爵苑农舍的事，还有其他几十桩事——她开始想去看看那小家伙。正当她在琢磨计划该如何才能成行时，一件让她无比惊讶的事发生了——她收到了她弟弟的来信，伯爵邀请她和她丈夫一起去多林考特。

“这简直让人难以置信！”她喊道，“我听说那孩子对我弟弟有奇迹般的影响力，现在我开始相信了。人们说他很喜欢那男孩，如果见不到，他几乎就不能忍受。他为那孩子感到无比骄傲！实际上，我认为，他是要让我们看看那孩子。”她马上接受了邀请。

当她和哈里爵士到达多林考特城堡时，已接近傍晚了，她在见到她弟弟之前，径直去了自己的房间。当她穿好衣服，准备吃饭时，她走进了客厅。伯爵站在火炉边，看起来身材高大、仪表堂堂；在他身边，站着一个小男孩，穿着黑色的天鹅绒衣服——小家伙浑圆的脸蛋是如此明亮、如此漂亮，那转向她的褐色眼睛是如此好看、如此坦率，以至于她一见，就几乎惊喜交加地喊了出来。

当她跟伯爵握手的时候，她叫了他的名字，从少女时代起，她就一直没有这么叫过他。

“嘿，莫里牛克斯，”她说，“这就是那个孩子吗？”

“是的，康斯坦蒂娅，”伯爵答道，“就是这男孩。方特勒罗伊，这是你的姑婆，康斯坦蒂娅·洛里耶尔女士。”

“您好吗，姑婆？”方特勒罗伊说。

洛里耶尔女士把手放在他肩膀上，低头看着他那昂起的小脸蛋，过了一会儿，她热情地吻了他。

“我是你的姑婆康斯坦蒂娅，”她说，“我爱你那可怜的爸爸，你很像他。”

“当有人跟我说，我很像他时，我感到高兴。”方特勒罗伊答道，“因为好像大家都喜欢他——就像喜欢最最亲爱的一样——康斯坦蒂娅姑婆。”（停顿了一会儿，他加上了最后几个词。）

洛里耶尔女士很高兴。她弯下腰，又一次吻了他，从那一时刻起，他们成了好朋友。

“哎，莫里牛克斯，”事后，她跟伯爵说，“不可能有比这更好的事了。”

“我想也是，”伯爵干巴巴地答道，“他是个很出色的小家伙，我们是极为要好的朋友。他相信我是最有魅力、脾气最好的慈善家。我要向你坦白，康斯坦蒂娅——如果我不坦白，你也会发现的——我差点成为他周围的一个老傻瓜。”

“他母亲对你有什么看法？”洛里耶尔女士以她一贯的直截了当问道。

“我没有问过她。”伯爵有点愠怒地答道。

“那好，”洛里耶尔女士说，“我要一开始就直率地告诉你，莫里牛克斯，我不喜欢你的做法。依我之见，应该尽快把埃罗尔夫人请来，如果你想跟我吵架，你最好立即提出来。根据我所听到的一切，我确信，小家伙是她的全部。甚至在洛里耶尔，就有人告诉我们，你那些穷困的佃户已经很喜欢她了。”

“他们喜欢的是他，”伯爵朝方特勒罗伊点点头，说，“至于埃罗尔夫人嘛，你会发现她是一个漂亮的小女人。我很感激她，因为是她把漂亮传给了这男孩。如果你愿意，你可以去见她。我所要求的是，她将留在罗奇苑，你别指望我去看她。”他又有点愠怒了。

“不过，他并没有像过去那样地憎恶她了，那是很明显的。”夫人事后对哈里爵士说，“在某种程度上来说，他已经变了个人，这一点简直难以置信。哈里，我的看法是，正是他对小家伙的爱，而不是别的什么，使他重新变了一个人。那孩子也确确实实爱他——此时正依靠着他的椅子和膝盖呢。如果那是伯爵自己的儿子，他们可能马上就会想到，他们所倚靠的是一只老虎。”

就在第二天，她就去看望了埃罗尔夫人。回来后，她对她弟弟说：

“莫里牛克斯，她是我所见过的最最可爱的小女人！她的声音像银铃一般。你要感谢她，因为她把男孩培养得这样好。她所给予他的不仅仅是漂亮。你没有说服她来照顾你，是犯了一个大错，我要把她请到洛里耶尔去。”

“她不会离开那男孩的。”伯爵答道。

“我要把男孩也带走。”洛里耶尔女士笑着说。

但是她知道伯爵不会放弃方特勒罗伊，让她把他带走的。她日益清楚地看到，他们俩已经变得亲密无间，那傲慢、严厉的老头已把他所有的雄心、希望和爱意都集中在孩子身上了，而回报他的爱意的，是本性温和、单纯的孩子最最完全的信任和忠诚。

她也知道，伯爵举办盛大宴会，主要是缘于他的一个秘密想法，即他要让世人看到他的孙子和继承人，他要人们看到，这个被广泛谈论和描述的小男孩甚至比流言所说的还要美好。

“贝维斯和莫里斯使他蒙受了多少痛苦的羞辱，”她对她丈夫说，“这是大家都知道的。实际上，他讨厌他们。支配这场宴会的是十足的傲慢。”也许，在接受邀请的人中，没有一个人不对小方特勒罗伊勋爵感到好奇，没有一个人会不想知道他是否会出场。

宴会时间到来时，他出场了。

“孩子的举止很文雅。”伯爵说，“他从不妨碍别人。一般孩子通常要么是白痴，要么是讨厌鬼——我自己的孩子中，既有白痴也有讨厌鬼——但是，当你跟他说话时，他一定会搭腔；没有人跟他说话时，他会保持沉默。他永远不会冒犯别人。”

但是人们不让他长久沉默，人人都有话要跟他说。事实是，他们想让他开口说话。女士们宠爱他，问他问题；男士们也问他问题，还跟他开玩笑，就像他横渡大西洋时，轮船上的人们所做的那样。方特勒罗伊不太明白，为什么有时候他回答他们的问题，他们要大笑不止呢。不过，他已很习惯于在他自己相当严肃的时候，看着别人乐不可支，所以他一点儿都不介意。他感到整个夜晚都很快乐。宏伟的房间里，有着那么明亮的灯光，那么多花朵。绅士们显得那么高兴，女士们穿着那么漂亮的、迷人的衣服，她们头发上、脖子上的装饰品是那样地闪闪发光。其中有一位年轻的女士，方特勒罗伊听人说，她在伦敦度过了“社交旺季”，刚刚来到此地。她是如此迷人，以至于他无法使自己的目光离开她。她是一位身材高挑的年轻女郎，骄傲的小脑袋上长着极为柔顺的黑发，一双大眼睛有三色紫罗兰一样的颜色，双颊和双唇都像玫瑰一样鲜艳。她穿着漂亮的白色长裙，脖子上戴着珍珠项链。许许多多绅士站在她身边，看上去都想讨她欢心。方特勒罗伊想，她肯定是一个公主似的人。他对她是如此感兴趣，以至于他不知不觉地向她越走越近，最后她转过身来跟他说话了。

“过来，方特勒罗伊少爷，”她微笑着说，“告诉我，你为什么老是看着我？”

“我在想，你真漂亮啊。”小勋爵答道。

所有的绅士们都哈哈大笑，年轻的女郎也笑了，脸颊上的玫瑰色更显著了。

“啊，方特勒罗伊，”刚才笑得最开心的一个绅士说，“好好使用你的年幼时光！等你长大了，你就不会有勇气那么说话了。”

“可是所有的人都会情不自禁地那么说的。”方特勒罗伊甜甜地说，“你能忍得住吗？难道你不认为她很漂亮吗？”

“我们不允许心里想什么，嘴上就说什么。”那位绅士说，同时，其他绅士笑得更厉害了。

但是那年轻漂亮的女郎——她叫薇微安·贺波特小姐——伸出手，把塞德里克拉到她身边，看上去比刚才更美了——如果能这么说的话。

“方特勒罗伊勋爵可以想什么就说什么。”她说，“我很感激他。我相信，他想的就是他说的。”说完，她吻着他的脸颊。

“我觉得你比我所见过的任何人都漂亮，”方特勒罗伊用单纯的、爱慕的目光看着她，说，“除了最最亲爱的。当然，我想不出有任何人能像最最亲爱的那么漂亮。我觉得她是世上最漂亮的了。”

“我相信她是最漂亮的。”薇微安·贺波特小姐说，她再次一边笑着，一边吻着他的脸颊。

那天晚上的大部分时间里，她都让他待在她身边，以他们为中心，人们玩得非常快乐。但过不多久，塞德里克就把美国的事一五一十地告诉了他们——共和党游行啦，霍布斯先生啦，迪克啦。最后他骄傲地从口袋里拿出了迪克送给他的临别礼物——那条红色的手帕。

“今天晚上，我把它放在了口袋里，因为有宴会。”他说，“我想，迪克会喜欢我在宴会上带着它。”

他眼中的目光是严肃的、可爱的，这阻止了观众们的大笑。

“你们瞧，我喜欢它，”他说，“因为迪克是我的朋友。”

尽管他谈了那么多，但正如伯爵所说的，他并不妨碍别人。在别人谈话时，他会静静地听着，所以没人觉得他讨厌。有几次，当他走向祖父，站在他的椅子边上，或者坐在靠近他的凳子上，看着他，怀着浓厚的兴趣，倾听着他吐出的每一个词时，旁边不止一个人脸上露出了微笑。有一回，他站得如此靠近椅子的扶手，以致他的脸颊都碰到了伯爵的肩膀。老伯爵看着大家的微笑，他自己也微微笑了。他知道旁边的人在想什么，他们已经明白他跟他的小孙子是多么好的朋友。他们料想，这祖孙俩在一般的事情上，肯定观点一致。想到这，他感到了某种神秘的乐趣。

哈维沙姆先生本来说好下午到，但是，很奇怪，他迟到了。在所有过去的年头里，他访问多林考特城堡时，从来没有人听说迟到这类事。他来得如此迟，以至于他到时，客人们都已起身去准备用膳了。当他走近主人时，伯爵迷惑地看着他。他看上去好像刚才赶得很急，或焦虑不安，他那干瘪的、紧张的老脸全然苍白了。

“我迟到了，”他以低沉的声音对伯爵说，“由于——一个非同寻常的事故。”

这不像是他说的话，作为一个训练有素的老律师，他不该为迟到这类事而烦恼，可是显而易见的是，他的方寸确实是被打乱了。吃饭的时候，他几乎没吃任何东西，有两三次，当别人跟他说话时，他满脸惊讶，就好像他的思绪远在天边似的。吃点心的时候，方特勒罗伊走到他身边，不止一次，他神情紧张不安地看着孩子。方特勒罗伊注意到了他的神情，想知道到底是怎么回事。他跟哈维沙姆先生早已是朋友，他们常常交换笑容。

但是那天晚上，律师似乎连笑都忘记了。

事实是，他忘了一切，只记得那个奇怪的悲惨的消息，他知道，他必须当夜告诉伯爵——他所听说过的那个消息将令人大惊失色，将改变所有这一切。他环视着金碧辉煌的房间，兴高采烈的人群，当他看着傲慢的老人，看着微笑着坐在老人身边的方特勒罗伊勋爵时，尽管他是一个心肠很硬的老律师，他内心还是感到震颤。他不得不处理的是一个多么大的突发事件啊！

他不清楚这漫长的、豪华的宴会如何才能结束。他坐在欢宴的气氛中，如同身在梦中，有几次，他看见伯爵在惊讶地盯着他看。

不过，宴会终于结束了。绅士们来到了客厅里，和女士们在一起。他们发现，方特勒罗伊正跟伦敦的社交界大美人——薇微安·贺波特小姐一起坐在沙发上。两人看了一些图画，门打开时，方特勒罗伊正在向他的同伴道谢。

“你对我这么好，我非常非常感谢你！”他说，“我以前从未参加过宴会，我玩得很开心！”

他的确玩得很开心，以至于当绅士们重新围着贺波特小姐，开始跟她说话时，他听着，竭力想听懂他们夹杂着笑声的谈话，但他的眼睑开始耷拉下来了。有两三次，他的眼睛甚至被眼皮盖没了，而贺波特小姐那低低的、悦耳的笑声又使他缓过神来，他再一次睁开眼睛，但也只是两秒钟罢了。他非常确信，自己不会睡着，但是他身后有一块黄色缎子做的大垫背，他的脑袋倒在上面，过了一会儿，他的眼睑就一直耷拉着了，眼睛一直没有睁开。好像过了很久很久之后，有人轻轻地吻了吻他的脸颊，那是贺波特小姐，她要走了，她柔和地对他说：“晚安。方特勒罗伊小少爷。”她说，“好好睡吧。”

到了第二天早上，他都不知道，当时他使劲想睁开眼睛，惺忪地嘟哝着说：“晚安——我很高兴——我看见了你——你太——太漂亮了……”

他只是模模糊糊地想起，他听见绅士们又笑了，还想知道他们为什么要笑呢。

最后一个客人一离开房间，哈维沙姆先生就从炉边转过身，走近沙发，站在那儿，低头看着那沉睡的孩子。方特勒罗伊勋爵睡得安适极了。他的两条腿交叉着，挂在沙发的边上，一条胳膊轻轻地搭在头上。他睡得那样健康、快乐，那安宁的、孩子气的脸上，泛着温暖的红晕。他那头光亮的乱发披散在黄缎子垫背上。他那样子就像一幅图画，值得人们好好观赏。

哈维沙姆先生看着这幅画，他举起手，摸着刮过了的下巴，神情显得很烦恼。

“喂，哈维沙姆。”伯爵在他身后叫他，“怎么回事？我看得出来，肯定出了什么事了。我问你，到底发生了什么意外？”

哈维沙姆先生从沙发边走过来，仍然摸着下巴。

“是个坏消息，”他答道，“很坏的消息，老爷——最最坏的消息。要由我来传递这消息，真让我难过。”

晚上，当伯爵盯着哈维沙姆先生看时，有一阵子很是不安，而当他不安时，他总是脾气很坏。

“你为什么那样看着孩子！”伯爵恼怒地叫道，“整个晚上你一直在看着他，现在你来看我这儿，为什么你要看着那男孩，哈维沙姆，像一只乌鸦似的盘旋在他上头，仿佛要带来什么厄运！你那个坏消息跟小方特勒罗伊有什么关系？”

“老爷，”哈维沙姆先生说，“我不想再浪费口舌了。我的消息完全跟方特勒罗伊有关。如果我们相信这个消息——那么现在躺在我们面前的，就不是方特勒罗伊勋爵，而只是埃罗尔上尉的儿子。真正的方特勒罗伊勋爵应该是您的儿子贝维斯的儿子，此刻他正在伦敦的一所仆人房子里。”

伯爵的双手紧抓着椅子的扶手，直到青筋暴露出来，他额头上的青筋也暴露出来了，他那酷厉的老脸几乎发青了。

“你这话是什么意思？”他叫了出来，“你疯了！是谁造的谣言？”

“如果这只是一个谣言，”哈维沙姆先生答道，“也太像是事实了。今天早上，一个女人来到我的住处。她说，六年前在伦敦，您的儿子贝维斯娶了她。她还给我看了结婚证。婚后一年，他们一直在吵架，后来他付了她一笔钱，让她别再缠着他。她有一个五岁的儿子。她是一个美国人，出身低贱——没有文化——直到最近，她才完全知道她儿子能够享有的权利。她去向一个律师咨询，弄清楚了她的孩子才是真正的方特勒罗伊勋爵，多林考特伯爵领地的真正继承人。当然，她坚持要我告诉她她儿子的权利。”

那黄缎子垫背上的鬈毛头动了一下。从那张开的嘴巴里，发出一声柔和的、长长的、惺忪的叹息。接着，方特勒罗伊那睡梦中的身子也微微动了一下，不过没有一点不安或不适。就好像他的睡眠被惊扰了一下，而惊扰他的是这样一个事实，即他被证明是一个小骗子，而根本不是方特勒罗伊勋爵，永远不会成为多林考特伯爵。他只是把那玫瑰般的小脸蛋更多地侧过来一些，就好像是为了使老人看得更清楚些，老人正严肃地盯着他看。

那英俊的、酷厉的老脸死一样苍白，露出了一丝痛苦的微笑。

“如果这不是一件下流的、卑鄙的事，”他说，“我应该拒绝相信，我一个字都不相信。但这事跟我的儿子贝维斯的名字连在一起，八成就是真的。这很像是贝维斯的作为。他总是给我们丢脸。他总是懦弱、不忠、邪恶，像头小野兽似的，趣味低下——我的儿子和继承人，贝维斯，方特勒罗伊勋爵。那女人既无知又粗俗，你是这么说的吗？”

“我得承认，我是那么说的，她几乎不会写自己的名字。”律师答道，“她一点儿书都没有念过，而且赤裸裸地唯利是图。除了钱，她什么都不关心。她很漂亮，但很俗气，不过——”

喜欢挑剔的老律师停止了说话，身子战栗了一下。

老伯爵前额上的青筋暴突着，如同紫色的绳索。另一样东西也在他额头上突显出来——那是冷汗。他拿出手帕，擦去汗滴，他的笑容变得更加苦楚。

“我，”他说，“我反对——反对那个女人——这孩子的母亲（他指着沙发上熟睡的塞德里克），我拒绝承认她，而她是能写自己的名字的。我想这真是报应啊。”

突然，他从椅子里跳了起来，开始在房间里踱来踱去。激烈的可怕的话语从他的嘴唇中倾泻而出。暴怒、厌恨和残酷的失望摇撼着他，像暴风雨摇撼一棵树。他的凶暴让人见了都感到可怕。但是哈维沙姆先生注意到，在他最最愤怒的时候，他似乎从未忘记那个睡在黄缎子靠垫上的小家伙，从未曾高声说话，以免惊醒孩子。

“我应该早点儿知道这种事。”他说，“从一开始他们就给我丢了脸！我讨厌他们俩，他们俩也讨厌我！两人中贝维斯更坏。尽管如此，我不会相信这个消息！我要斗争到最后。但是这太像贝维斯的行为了——太像了！”

随后，他又一次暴怒起来，就那个女人和她的证据，问了几个问题。同时，他在房间里来回地走，由于压抑着狂怒，他的脸色一会儿白、一会儿紫。

最后，哈维沙姆先生把一切都告诉了他，他听到了最糟糕的真相。哈维沙姆先生焦虑地看着他，他看上去崩溃了，憔悴了，像是换了个人。暴怒对他总是有害的，而这回的暴怒比以往的更加有害，因为除了暴怒，还有某种别的东西。

最后，他慢慢地走回到沙发旁边，站在那儿。

“如果有人以前跟我说我会喜欢孩子，”他那沙哑的声音更加低沉、更加不稳了，他说，“我不会相信他们，我一直讨厌孩子——尤其讨厌我自己的孩子。但是我喜欢这一个，他也喜欢我。”（他苦楚地笑了笑）“我不受人欢迎，从不受人爱戴。但是他喜欢我，他从不怕我——他一直信任我。他将来当了伯爵，会比我当得好。我很清楚这一点。他会给他的名号增添荣耀。”

他弯腰站了一分钟左右，看着那张幸福的、熟睡的小脸蛋。他那粗浓的眉毛狠狠地拧着，但是他看上去一点儿都不狠毒。他举起了手，将孩子前额上光亮的头发往后推了推，然后转过身去，摇响了铃铛。

当那个个子最大的仆人出现在门口时，他指了指沙发。

“把——”他说，旋即他的声音稍稍变了一点儿，“把方特勒罗伊勋爵抱到他自己的房间里去。”





第十一章　美国的焦虑


霍布斯先生年幼的朋友离开了他，去了多林考特城堡，成为方特勒罗伊勋爵。过了一段时间，这位杂货店老板才意识到，在他自己和那个小伙伴之间，横亘着大西洋。那孩子曾跟他在一起，度过了那么多舒坦的时光，现在他真正感到了孤独。事实是，霍布斯先生不是一个聪明人，甚至不是一个明白人；实际上，他是一个挺迟钝、挺笨拙的人，他从未交过很多朋友。他在智力上不足以知道如何来自娱自乐，事实上，除了看看报纸，算算账目，他从未做过别的乐事。对他来说，算账可不是一件容易的事。有时候，他要花很长时间，才能把账算准确。过去，方特勒罗伊学会了怎样算账，他用手指头、写字板和铅笔来算，算得还相当准确。有时候，他甚至竭力帮助霍布斯先生算账呢。那时，他也一直是一个很好的倾听者，对报纸所讲的东西极有兴趣，关于战争、英国人、选举和共和党，他们俩曾进行过好多次长谈。毫无疑问，塞得里克的离去给杂货店里留下了空白。一开始，霍布斯先生似乎觉得，塞德里克并没有真的走得很远，而且还会回来的。有朝一日，当他从报纸上抬起目光，会看见小家伙站在门口，穿着白色的套装、红色的长袜，后脑勺上戴着草帽。他会听见他用奶声奶气的声音说：“喂，霍布斯先生！今儿天很热——是吗？”可是日子一天天地过去，这样的美事再也没有发生。霍布斯先生感到非常沉闷、焦躁。他甚至不再像以前那样喜欢看报纸了。他读完后，把报纸放在膝盖上，久久地坐着，盯看着那只高凳子。使他感到沮丧和忧郁的是，长长的凳腿上留有一些印记，是下一任多林考特伯爵用脚后跟踢出来的。塞德里克常常在聊天的同时，用脚后跟踢着凳腿，似乎也喜欢踢他们坐着的凳腿，看上去贵族血统和高贵世系好像并不禁止伯爵们喜欢踢他们坐着的凳腿。看着这些印记，霍布斯先生拿出了金表，打开盒子，盯着刻文：“送给霍布斯先生，老朋友方特勒罗伊勋爵。当你看见它时，请记起我。”看了一阵子后，他把盒子关上，声音很响。然后他叹了一口气，站起来，走到门口——站在土豆箱和苹果桶之间——抬头望着大街。晚上，店铺打烊后，他点着了烟斗，慢慢地沿着人行道走啊走，直走到塞德里克曾住过的房子那儿。房子上有一个启事：“此房招租”他在房子旁边停下来，抬头看看，又摇摇头，重重地抽着烟斗。就这样过了一阵子，他又哀伤地走回来。

在他没想出任何新主意之前，这种情况延续了两三个礼拜，由于迟钝和笨拙，他往往要花很长时间，才能想出一个新主意。他一贯不喜欢新主意，而宁愿要旧的。尽管如此，两三个礼拜后，一个新的计划像黎明似的，慢悠悠地、不慌不忙地来到了他那黑暗的脑袋中。在过去的两三个礼拜中，情况没有好转，反而恶化了。他想去看看迪克，在他得出结论之前，他抽掉了好几管烟，他想去看看迪克，他知道迪克的一切。塞德里克曾对他说起过。他的主意是，也许去跟迪克聊一聊这事，会给他带来些许安慰。

于是，一天，当迪克正在起劲地干活——给一个顾客擦鞋，一个矮壮的男人在人行道上站定——他的脸盘很大，脑袋已经秃顶。他对着那擦鞋匠的牌子，看了两三分钟。只见牌子上写道：





行家迪克·蒂普顿

是不会被打败的。





霍布斯先生盯着那些字看了很久很久，以至于迪克开始对他产生了强烈的兴趣，当他给顾客的鞋子擦完最后一下时，他说：“想擦鞋吗，先生？”

那个矮壮的男人走上前去，把脚搁在歇息的地方。

“是的。”他说。

随后，迪克就开始干活了。那个矮壮的男人从迪克看到牌子，又从牌子看到迪克。

“你从哪儿得来这牌子的？”他问道。

“是从我的一个朋友那儿，”迪克说，“一个小家伙。他送了我一整套工具。他是你所见过的最最好的小家伙。他现在在英国。去当勋爵啦。”

“勋爵——勋爵——”霍布斯先生既笨拙又迟钝地问道，“是方特勒罗伊勋爵——将成为多林考特伯爵的那位吗？”

迪克差点没掉了手上的刷子。

“天哪！”他大叫道，“你怎么认识他的？”

“他一出生，”霍布斯先生擦了擦发热的额头，答道，“我就认识他了。我们曾是形影不离的朋友——我们曾经是那样的关系。”

说起这话委实使他感到苦恼。他把精致的金表从口袋里拿出来，把盒子打开，然后给迪克看盒子的内壁。

“‘当你看到它时，请记起我。’”他读着，“那是他临别时送给我的纪念品。‘我要你别忘了我。’——那都是他的话——哪怕他不曾给我礼物，虽然分别后，我连他的一根汗毛都没见过。”他摇着头，继续说，“其实我是一直记着他的。他是一个任何人都会记住的好伙伴。”

“他是我平生所见过的最优秀的小家伙。”迪克说，“至于说到胆量——我从未见过一个小家伙这么有胆量——我跟他也是朋友——那个小家伙和我，是可靠的朋友。我帮他从马车底下抢出皮球。他一直记着这事。他经常跟他母亲或保姆一起到我这儿来。一到，他就会冲着我喊：‘喂，迪克！’他是一个快乐的小家伙——当你运气背的时候，跟他聊聊，是很有好处的。”

“是这样的，”霍布斯先生说，“让他去当伯爵，真是有点儿可惜。他在杂货堆或干货堆中光彩夺目，他的确是光彩夺目！”他摇着头，比以前任何时候都更加后悔了。

事实证明，他们俩有太多的话要跟对方说，以至于要想一次说完都不可能。最后两人商定，次日晚上，迪克去杂货店访问并陪伴霍布斯先生。这计划使迪克高兴坏了，有生以来，他几乎一直是个街头流浪汉，但是他从来就不是坏小子。他内心里总渴望着一种更加受人尊敬的生活。由于他一直在为自己干活，他已经挣了足够的钱，所以他现在能够睡在屋子里了，而不是外面的大街上。他已经开始希望，某一天他能达到一个更加高的水平。所以，当他受到霍布斯先生的邀请时，他似乎觉得这是一个很好的机会，因为霍布斯先生是一个矮壮的、受人尊敬的人，在街头拐角处，他拥有一个杂货店，甚至还有一匹马、一辆马车呢。

“你知道什么关于伯爵和城堡的事吗？”霍布斯先生问道，“我想知道更多的详情。”

“在《一便士故事报》上，有一个关于他们的故事，”迪克说，“叫作《凤冠的罪恶——女伯爵梅复仇记》。这是一个一流的故事，我们这儿有些男孩子正看得津津有味呢。”

“你来的时候，把报纸带过来。”霍布斯先生说，“我会付给你钱的。凡是你能找到的，里面讲到伯爵的书刊，你都给我带来。如果没有关于伯爵的，关于侯爵或公爵的也行——尽管小家伙从未提到过侯爵或公爵。

“我们曾经用到过冠冕，但我从不曾碰巧见过任何这类东西。我猜想，在这儿，他们不保留这类东西。”

“假如有人用，那么蒂凡尼珠宝店那儿应该会有。”迪克说，“但是，我不知道；假如我看到过，我是知道的。”

霍布斯先生没有解释的是：即使他见过，他也不会知道。他只是沉重地摇着头。

“我猜想啊，那是因为现在几乎没有人需要冠冕了。”他说。这事就算是了了。

这是个开端，从此两人结成了坚固的友谊。当迪克到杂货店去时，霍布斯先生极其殷勤地招待他，为他搬一把椅子，斜靠在门上，旁边就是一桶苹果。一等这年轻的客人坐下，他就用手中的烟斗指了指苹果，说：“你自己拿吧。”

然后他就读登载着那个故事的报纸。读完后，他们俩开始讨论英国的贵族体制。霍布斯先生狠狠地抽了几口烟，一个劲儿地摇头。当他指出小家伙曾坐过的高凳，并说凳子腿上还留着印记时，他的头摇得更厉害了。

“那些印记是他给踢出来的。”他一字一顿地说，“就是他踢出来的。我常常一个小时一个小时地坐着，看着它们。世运真是三十年河东，三十年河西啊。你瞧，他曾经就坐在那儿，从盒子里拿饼干吃，从桶子里拿苹果吃，而现在他是一个勋爵了，住进了城堡里。那些可是勋爵踢出来的痕迹，有朝一日，还将是伯爵的痕迹呢。有时候，我心里想，唉，哪会有这事！”

从回忆中，从迪克的来访中，他似乎得到了很大的安慰。迪克回家之前，他们在后屋里一起吃了晚饭。他们吃了饼干、奶酪、沙丁鱼以及店里的其他一些罐装食品。霍布斯先生神情严肃地打开了两瓶姜汁酒，倒进两只杯子里，提议干杯。

“为他干杯！”霍布斯先生举起杯子，说，“但愿他教训教训——所有那些侯爵啦、公爵啦！”

从那晚以后，两人常常见面，霍布斯先生感到了更多的安慰，也不那么沮丧了。他们阅读《一便士故事报》和其他有趣的东西，知道了一些贵族们和绅士们的生活习惯。如果让那些被鄙视的下层人知道了这些习惯，他们会大吃一惊的。有一天，霍布斯先生还专程进城，他的目的很明确，就是要到书店去，给他们的书库增加一些资料。他走向一个工作人员，身子靠在柜台上，说：

“我想要，”他说，“一本关于伯爵的书。”

“什么？”工作人员喊道。

“一本书，”杂货店老板重复道，“关于伯爵的。”

“我恐怕，”那个工作人员看起来感到很奇怪的样子，说，“我们这儿没有您想要的书。”

“没有？”霍布斯先生焦躁地说，“哦，那么，侯爵的或公爵的也可以。”

“这种书我一本都不知道，”那个工作人员答道。

霍布斯先生感到很恼火。他低头看看地板，然后又抬起了头。

“连关于女伯爵的都没有吗？”他询问道。

“恐怕是没有。”那个工作人员笑着说。

“咳！”霍布斯先生喊道，“哪有这种事！”

他正要走出书店时，工作人员把他叫了回去，问他，如果一本书中故事里的主要人物都是贵族，他要不要。霍布斯先生说也行——如果他买不到整本关于伯爵的书的话。于是工作人员把一本叫作《伦敦塔》的书卖给了他，书的作者是哈里森·安斯沃思先生。霍布斯先生这才带着书回家。

等迪克来时，他们就一起阅读。这本书非常精彩、刺激，其时代背景设在一个英国著名的女王的统治时期，有人把女王叫作“血腥的玛丽”。当霍布斯先生读到女王玛丽的行为和习惯，如砍掉人的头颅，如对人严刑拷打，如把人活活烧死，他就变得非常激动。他把烟斗从嘴巴里抽出来，然后盯着迪克，最后他不得不用手帕擦掉眉宇间的汗水。

“哎哟，他可不安全！”他说，“他可不安全！如果女人们坐上宝座，谁能知道此时此刻他发生了什么事呢？他一点儿都不安全！让玛丽那样的女人疯狂行事，谁都不会安全！”

“呃，”尽管迪克自己看起来也相当着急，但是他说，“你瞧，书上的这一个不是现在掌权的那一个。我知道现在那个的名字，她叫维多利亚，而书上的这个名叫玛丽。”

“原来如此，”霍布斯先生还在擦额头上的汗水，他说，“原来如此。报纸上没有提到任何关于拉肢刑架、拇指夹或火刑柱的事，可是，让他在那边，跟那些古怪的人们在一起，我们似乎仍然不能说他是安全的。唉，他们告诉我，他们连七月四日的国庆节都不过！”

有好几天，他暗自感到不安，直到他收到了方特勒罗伊的信件。他读了好几遍，既读给自己听，也读给迪克听，他又读到了迪克同时收到的信件，这才心安。

不过，他们俩都在信件中发现了极大的快乐。他们读了一遍又一遍，谈论了一次又一次，他们喜欢信上的每一个词。他们花了好几天时间写回信，几乎跟读收到的信一样，他们一遍遍地阅读自己写的回信。

对于迪克来说，写信是件非常费力的事。他所受过的读、写教育时间全部加起来只有几个月，那是他跟他哥哥住在一起的时候，去夜校里学的；不过，他是一个很敏锐的小伙子，他最充分地利用了那段短暂的教育。从那以后，他就能阅读报纸了，并且能用粉笔头在人行道上或墙壁上或篱笆上练习写字。他把自己生平的所有情况，都告诉了霍布斯先生。当他还很小很小的时候，母亲去世了，他哥哥对他非常好。他们的父亲死得更早。他哥哥名叫本，曾经尽其所能照顾迪克，直到迪克长大一些了，足以去卖报纸，给人跑腿。

“那时候，”迪克有点儿厌恶地高声说，“如果他没有去跟一个女孩结婚就好了！他像着了魔似的，完全失去了理性！跟她结了婚，然后在两间小房子里安了家。她人高马大，一个十足的母老虎。她发起怒来，就把东西摔成碎片——她老是发怒。孩子跟她一个德行——整日整夜地哭叫！如果我不是非得看护这孩子就好了！孩子一哭，她就把东西扔过来打我。有一回，她把一只盘子扔过来，打中了孩子——打破了下巴。医生说，那伤疤到死都消不了。她可真是一个好母亲！一个疯子！但是我们没有时间——本和我都没有时间花在孩子身上。她疯狂地虐待本，因为本没能快速地挣钱。最后，他跟另一个男子远走西部，去开创了一个养牛场。他走之前那个礼拜的一个晚上，我卖完报纸回家，只见房门锁着，里面空荡荡的。女房东告诉我说，明娜走了——她还给我看了一双干干净净的鞋后跟。有人说，她涉过河水，去给一位太太当奶娘，那位太太也刚生了个孩子。从那以后，再也没有听到她的一点儿消息——也没有本的消息。如果我是我哥，我不会像他那样烦恼。可是，他一开始就把她当成女神。告诉你吧，他是被她给迷住了。当她打扮好了，不疯不怒时，她也真是美得像花一样。她的眼睛又黑又大，一头黑发直垂到膝盖。她把头发编成辫子，有你的胳膊那么粗，然后一圈圈地盘在头上。我跟你说，她的眼睛会咬人！人们常常说，她有意大利的血统——说她的母亲或父亲来自意大利，这使她看上去有点儿古里古怪。”迪克经常跟霍布斯先生讲他哥哥和嫂子的事，本自从离家出走到西部去之后，曾给迪克来过一两次信。本的运气不好，从一个地方流荡到另一个地方，不过，最后，他总算在加利福尼亚建成了一个农场。他在那儿工作之时，正是迪克跟霍布斯先生结识的时候。

“那个女的，”一天，迪克说，“夺走了他所有的勇气。有时候，我忍不住为他感到难过。”

他们俩一起坐在商店门口，霍布斯先生往烟斗里装着烟叶。

“他不应该结婚。”当他站起身来去拿火柴的时候，严肃地说，“女人——我从来看不出女人有什么好处。”

当他从盒子里取出火柴，他停住了话头，低头看着柜台。

“哇！”他说，“看这儿，这不是一封信嘛！我以前没见过这信。肯定是在我不注意的时候，邮递员放在这儿的，或者是因为报纸滑过去，把它给盖住了。”

霍布斯先生拿起信，仔细地看了看。

“是他寄来的！”他惊喜地叫道，“真是他寄来的！”

他全然忘了他的烟斗，激动万分地坐回到椅子上，从口袋里拿出了小折刀，划开信封。

“我想知道，这回有什么消息。”他说。

然后他打开信，读了起来：





多林考特城堡

亲爱的霍布斯先生：

这封信我写得匆匆忙忙，因为我有件奇怪的事要告诉你，我知道当我告诉你的时候你会大吃一惊的，我亲爱的朋友。这完全是一个误会，我不是勋爵，我将不必再当伯爵了。有一个女人嫁给了我的伯伯贝维斯，我伯父已经去世了，她有个小男孩，这个小男孩才是真正的方特勒罗伊勋爵。因为在英国事情就是这样的：如果其他所有的继承人都死了，我的意思是说，如果父亲和祖父都死了的话，就由伯爵的长子的儿子继承爵位。我祖父没有死，但我伯父贝维斯死了，所以他的儿子成了方特勒罗伊勋爵，而我不是，因为我爸爸是老小。我现在又叫塞德里克·埃罗尔了，跟我在纽约时是一样的，所有的东西都将属于那个男孩子。我想，首先我得把小马驹和马车给他但是我祖父说这没必要。我祖父非常难过，因为我想他，是不喜欢那个女人的，不过也可能因为他认为最最亲爱的和我都很难过，因为我不会成为伯爵了。比起先前，我觉得我会当伯爵的时候，我现在更喜欢当伯爵了，因为这里的城堡真美，我喜欢这里的每一个人。当你富有的时候，你能够做许许多多事，现在我一点儿也不富有，因为我爸爸是老小，他就不富有。我打算去学做工作，这样我才能照顾最最亲爱的。我已向威尔金斯请教过赶马的事，也许我会成为一个马夫或一个车夫。那个女人带着她的小男孩来到了城堡。我祖父和哈维沙姆先生跟她谈话，我觉得她发怒了，说话声音很高，我祖父也发怒了，以前我从来没有看见他发怒过。我希望他们不要为此而发了疯。我觉得我应该马上将情况告诉你和迪克，因为你们会感兴趣的。现在就不多说了。

你的老朋友塞德里克·埃罗尔

（不是方特勒罗伊勋爵）





霍布斯先生倒在了椅子上，信掉在了他的膝盖上，小折刀和信封都滑到了地板上。

“唉！”他叫道，“居然是这么回事！”

他惊讶万分，以至于连那句感叹的口头禅都改变了。他通常习惯于说：“哪有这种事。”但这次他说：“居然是这么回事。”也许他真的倒霉了。谁知道呢？

“嘿，”迪克说，“整个都失败了，是吗？”

“失败了！”霍布斯先生说，“我的看法是，这整个都是英国贵族们预先布置的骗局，他们剥夺了他的权利，因为他是一个美国人。自从独立战争以来，他们一直厌恨我们，现在在他身上发泄了厌恨。我告诉过你，他在那边不安全，你瞧，现在发生了什么！整个英国政府勾结起来，剥夺了他的合法财产。”

霍布斯先生被大大激怒了。起初他不同意小家伙的环境的变化，可是后来，他妥协了，在接到塞德里克的信后，他从小家伙的荣华富贵中，更是感觉到了些许秘密的骄傲。他可能对伯爵没什么好感，但他知道，甚至在美国，钱也被人们认为是一种讨人喜欢的东西。如果小家伙所有的荣华富贵都随爵号而消逝，是让人感到难以接受的。

“他们正在竭力剥夺他的权益！”他说，“那就是他们正在干的勾当。那些有钱人应该照顾他。”

他又让迪克待了个把小时，两人仔细谈论了小家伙的问题。当年轻的迪克离去时，霍布斯先生送他到大街的拐角处。在他回杂货店的路上，他站在那所空房子的街道对面，盯着那个“房屋出租”的启事看了一阵子。他一个劲儿地抽烟，因为心里烦乱极了。





第十二章　对手提出要求


城堡的盛宴过去后没几天，几乎所有读点报纸的英国人都知道了发生在多林考特城堡的离奇故事。故事被人们添油加醋传说时，变得越来越有趣了。曾经有一个美国小男孩，被带到英国，被当成方特勒罗伊勋爵。人们都说这小家伙很优秀，又很漂亮，使村子里的人们都很喜欢他，也使老伯爵，即他的祖父，为他感到非常骄傲。他的母亲既年轻又漂亮，就因为她嫁给了埃罗尔上尉，所以一直得不到伯爵的原谅。另外，人们还说到了贝维斯，即死去的方特勒罗伊勋爵，说到了他奇怪的婚姻和奇怪的妻子。谁也不知道他妻子的情况，突然之间她却带着他们的儿子出现了。那个女人还说，她的孩子才是真正的方特勒罗伊勋爵，要享有他应得的权利。所有的这些事儿都被人们说着、写着，引起了极大的轰动。然后又有传闻说，多林考特伯爵对此突变的事件表示不满，也许要对法律规定的权利进行辩驳，这事有可能以令人惊讶的法庭审判来了结。

在额勒斯波罗村所在的那个郡，以前从未有过这样让人兴奋的事。赶集的日子里，人们成群结队地站在一起谈论此事，他们想知道后面会有什么事发生。农夫们互相邀约喝茶，告诉对方他们所听到的一切、想到的一切以及他们认为别人所想到的一切。他们讲述了一些奇妙的逸闻，如伯爵听到这事后如何暴跳如雷，如何决定不认那个新的方特勒罗伊勋爵，以及如何讨厌那个要求权利的母亲。不过，当然了，最能够谈论此事的，还是迪布尔太太，她比以往任何时候都受人欢迎。

“这事的前景不妙。”她说，“如果你问我，太太，我得说，这取决于他。尽管他对她很不好，竟然让她跟她的孩子分开——但他喜欢那孩子，那样一心一意地爱着他，为他感到骄傲。所以，这意外的事件几乎使他发疯。另外，这位新母亲不像小勋爵的母亲那样贤惠，她厚颜无耻，眼珠乌黑，像黑人似的。托马斯先生说，没有一个真正的绅士会贬低自己，受她指使。谁知道事情会有什么结果呢？如何才能了结呢？当简告诉我时，我差点没晕倒，那时刻，你用一根羽毛就可以把我打倒。”

事实上，人人都为这事感到激动。在城堡的书房里，伯爵和哈维沙姆先生多次交谈；在仆人大楼里，托马斯先生和男管家以及其他的男女仆人整天都在谈说这事，并且为之大呼小叫；而在马圈里，马夫威尔金斯干着活计，心态非常沮丧。他把那匹棕色小马驹养得比以前更漂亮了。他哀伤地对车夫说，在他教过骑马的小绅士中，没有一个比他学得更加勇敢，更自然，骑马跟在他后头都让人感到高兴。

但是，在这整个乱糟糟的局面中，有一个人非常镇定、安宁。那就是小方特勒罗伊勋爵。现在人们说他根本不是方特勒罗伊勋爵。当一开始别人将事件的情形解释给他听的时候，他确实感到有点不安和窘困，但那不是因为他的雄心被挫败了。

当伯爵把所发生的意外告诉他时，他坐在凳子上，手臂抱着膝盖，就像平常他听着有趣的事儿似的。伯爵讲完时，看起来他很是冷静。

“这事让我感到很不舒服，”他说，“这事让我感到很——不舒服！”

伯爵默默地看着方特勒罗伊。这事让他也感到很不舒服——他平生从未遇到过更不舒服的事了。当他看到，那平常洋溢着快乐的小脸蛋上，出现了烦恼的表情，他感到更加不舒服了。

“他们会从最最亲爱的那儿拿走她的房子和车子吗？”塞德里克轻声问道，非常焦虑、不安。

“不会的！”伯爵肯定地说——实际上是大声地说，“他们休想从她那儿拿走任何东西。”

“啊！”塞德里克的心情明显轻松下来了，他说，“真的不拿走吗？”

接着他抬头看着祖父。他的眼睛睁得大大的，柔和的目光中有着渴望的影子。

“另外那个男孩，”他以颤抖的声音说——“他必将——成为您的孙子——像我一样——是吗？”

“不会的！”伯爵答道——他的声音是那样高、那样激烈，塞德里克吓了一跳。

“不会吗？”他迷惑地大声说，“真的不会？我觉得——”

他突然之间从凳子上站了起来。

“即使我成不了伯爵，我还会是您的孙子吗？”他说，“我会像以前一样，做您的孙子吗？”他的脸由于紧张涨得红红的。

老伯爵从头至脚一遍遍地看着塞德里克！他那又浓又粗的眉毛紧紧地皱在一起，眉毛下那双深陷的眼睛放出了难受的目光——他是多么难受啊！

“我的小孙孙！”他说——你要相信，他的声音也很难受，几乎是颤抖的、碎裂的、嘶哑的。尽管他比以往说得更加肯定、更加强硬，但你根本想不到，那居然是伯爵的声音。他说：“是的，只要我活着，你就一直是我的小孙孙。有时候，我真的感到，你好像是我平生所有的唯一的孩子。”

塞德里克的脸腾地变红了，一直红到了头发根，显得舒缓而快乐。他把双手插进衣兜，直瞪瞪地看着祖父那高贵的眼睛。

“真的吗？”他说，“呃，那样我就不关心什么伯爵了，我才不关心我是否会成为伯爵呢。我还以为——您知道的，我还以为只有当了伯爵，才可以当您的孙子呢，而——而我不能当伯爵了。那就是我感到难受的原因。”

老伯爵把手放在塞德里克的肩膀上，把他拉近了些。

“他们不会从你这儿拿走任何东西的，我向你保证，”老伯爵声音急促地说，“到目前为止，我不相信他们会从你这儿拿走任何东西。你是来当伯爵的——呃，现在你仍然可以当伯爵。可是不管发生什么事，你会得到一切，我能够给你——一切！”

他似乎不是在跟一个孩子说话，他的面色和声音中有着果断的决心，更像是在对自己许诺——也许，他真的是在这么做。

他喜欢这孩子，为这孩子感到骄傲，他以前从不曾意识到，这喜欢和骄傲的心理抓住了他，抓得有多紧。他从未曾像现在这样见到了自己的力量，善良与美好。

以他顽固的本性，要他放弃他内心所决定的事——似乎是不可能的——比不可能还不可能。他下定决心，不经过艰苦卓绝的斗争，就决不放弃。

跟哈维沙姆先生见面后的短短几天里，那个宣称自己为方特勒罗伊夫人的女人，带着孩子亲自来过城堡。但她被打发走了。仆人在门口告诉她，伯爵不想见她，他的律师会接手她的案子。是托马斯把这消息传出来的，后来，在仆人房里，他还毫无顾忌地表达了对那个女人的看法。哈维沙姆先生说，由于他在一个历史悠久的高贵家族里，已经穿着号衣服役了很长时间，他一见那女人，就知道她是否是贵妇人。如果他把那个女人看作贵妇人的话，那他简直对女人没有任何判断力了。

“罗奇苑里的那一位，”托马斯又高声说道，“不管是不是美国人，任何一位绅士一眼就可以看出，她的一切都很得体。当我和亨利应招匆匆赶往城堡时，我把我自己的这个评论告诉了他。”

那个女人乘车走了。她那漂亮平庸的脸上，露出了半是惊恐、半是愤恨的表情。在面谈的时候，哈维沙姆先生注意到，尽管她性情热烈，举止粗豪、蛮横，尽管她竭力想装出一副聪明而勇敢的样子，但实际上她既不聪明也不勇敢。她早已自己把自己放在了方特勒罗伊夫人的位置上了，有时候，她几乎为此而感到志得意满，她似乎从未预料到会面临如此的反对意见。

“显而易见，”律师对埃罗尔夫人说，“她是个来自下三流的人物，在任何方面都缺乏教育和训练，跟我们这样的人交往时，她不知道平等的意义，所以显得很不习惯，不知道该干什么了。她一见城堡，就被唬住了。她被激怒了，但同时也被吓倒了。伯爵不愿意接见她，但是我劝他跟我一起去。当她看见伯爵走进房间时，脸色都吓白了——尽管她马上就满脸怒色，一口气都不停地又是威胁，又是要求。”

伯爵昂首阔步地走入房间，像一个不可战胜的高贵的巨人一样站着，他眉头紧皱，盯视着那个女人，没有屈尊搭腔。他只是盯着她，从头到脚打量她，就好像她是某种可憎的怪物。他任凭她诉说着，要求着，直到她说累了，他自己还是一言不发。过了一会儿，他说：

“你说你是我大儿子的妻子。如果那是真的，如果你所提供的证据足够充分，法律是会站在你那边的。那样的话，你的儿子就是方特勒罗伊勋爵。事情会弄个水落石出的，你可以放心。如果你的要求被证明是合理的，你会得到满足。在我有生之年，我既不想看见你，也不想看见你的孩子。在我死后，我这地方会不幸地被你弄得一团糟的。我早就预料到，你就是我的儿子贝维斯所要选的那种人。”

说完，他转身背对着她，就像他来时一样，昂首阔步地走出了房间。

那以后没几天，埃罗尔夫人正在狭小的起居室里写东西，女仆通报说，有客人来访。那女仆在通报时，脸上显出了兴奋的神情。她的眼睛瞪得圆圆的，充满了惊奇。由于年轻、缺乏经验，她以紧张的、同情的目光，看着女主人。

“伯爵亲自来看您了，夫人！”她颤巍巍地说。

当埃罗尔夫人走进会客室的时候，她看见一个老人站在虎皮小地毯上。他个子很高，相貌堂堂，一张老脸英俊而严肃，有着鹰一样的轮廓、长长的白胡子和固执的目光。

“我想，你是埃罗尔夫人吧？”

“是的。”她答道。

“我是多林考特伯爵。”他说。

他顿了顿，几乎是无意识地盯着她上抬的眼睛。她的眼睛跟那孩子的一模一样，也是那么大、那么可爱。在过去的几个月中，他每天都看见孩子抬起眼睛看着他。

“孩子很像你。”伯爵突然说。

“人们经常这么说，老爷，”她答道，“但是我喜欢想，他也像他父亲。”

当埃罗尔夫人跟伯爵说话的时候，她的声音非常甜美，举止非常优雅，而且神圣。对于他的突然到来，她似乎没显出一丁点儿的烦恼。

“是的。”伯爵说，“这孩子也——很像——我的儿子。”他举起手，使劲地捋着他那白色的大胡子。“你知道，”他说，“我为什么来这儿吗？”

“我已见过哈维沙姆先生，”埃罗尔夫人开口道，“他已把那个女人宣称权益的事告诉了我——”

“我来告诉你，”伯爵说，“他们会受到调查，如果有人会提出辩驳的话，他们还会受到辩驳。我来，是要告诉你，我将应用法律所赋予的所有权利，来维护小家伙的权益。他的权益——”

那温柔的声音打断了他。

“哪怕法律能够判给他，他也不会拥有任何他所无权拥有的东西。”她说。

“不幸的是，法律不能判给他。”伯爵说，“如果法律能够判给他的话，那就应该属于他。这让人讨厌的母子俩啊——”

“也许她关心她的孩子，正如我关心我的塞德里克，老爷。”娇小的埃罗尔夫人说，“如果她是您大儿子的妻子，她的儿子就是方特勒罗伊勋爵，而我的儿子则不是。”

她跟塞德里克一样，一点儿也不害怕他。她像塞德里克那样看着他。他一生都是一个暴君，却对她的言行私下里感到高兴。人们几乎从来不敢对他提出不同意见，而她提出来了，这使他享受到了某种新鲜感。

“我猜想，”他有点愁眉苦脸地说，“你宁愿他成不了多林考特伯爵，是吗？”

她年轻而美丽的脸庞一下就红了。

“成为多林考特伯爵，是一件非常惬意的事，我的老爷。”她说，“我知道那一点，但是，我最关心的是，他应该像他父亲那样——永远勇敢、正派、真实。”

“跟他祖父的样子恰成鲜明的对照，是吗？”老伯爵自嘲似的说。

“我还没有那么大的幸运来了解他的祖父，”埃罗尔夫人答道，“但是我知道，我的孩子相信——”她停顿了一小会儿，平静地看着伯爵的脸，继续说，“我知道塞德里克是爱您的。”

“如果你告诉他，我为什么不同意你到城堡里来的原因，”伯爵干巴巴地说，“他还会爱我吗？”

“不会，”埃罗尔夫人答道，“我想，他不会。那就是我不希望他知道的原因所在。”

“呃，”伯爵唐突地说，“很少有女人不愿意告诉他的。”

他突然开始在房间里踱来踱去，比以往任何时候都更加剧烈地捋着他的大胡子。

“是的，他很喜欢我，”他说，“我也喜欢他。在喜欢他之前，我不能说喜欢过什么东西。他一开始就讨我欢心。我是一个老人，已经厌倦了生活。他给了我某种生活的目标。我为他感到骄傲。想起有朝一日，他继承我的位置，成为家族的首领，我就感到满足。”

他踱了回来，站在埃罗尔夫人面前。

“我太惨了。”他说，“太惨了！”

看上去他好像确实很惨，甚至傲慢都不能使他保持声音的稳定，止住双手的颤动。有一阵子，他那深陷的、锐利的眼中几乎是流出了泪水。“也许是因为我太惨了，所以我才到你这儿来。”他低头盯着她说，“我以前讨厌你，嫉妒你，这件糟糕的、丢面子的事改变了我对你的态度。那个可憎的女人，她居然声称自己是我儿子贝维斯的妻子。见到她后，我就真正感到，过来看看你，会是一种宽慰。我曾是一个顽固的老傻瓜。我想，我一直对你很不好。你想你的孩子，而他是我生活的首要目标。我太惨了。我来到你这儿，只是因为你像你的儿子。他关心你，而我关心他。看在孩子的分儿上，请你尽可能好地对待我。”

他说着这一切，声音硬板，而且几乎是粗鲁的。可是，在某种程度上来说，他几乎垮了。那时刻，埃罗尔夫人的心被深深感动了。她站了起来，将一把扶手椅往前搬了一点儿。

“希望您能坐下来，”她温柔地、悦耳地、同情地说，“您总有那么多的麻烦事，所以您很累，您需要恢复一下体力。”

在她慰问他的时候，他又想起了“那个男孩”，一个劲儿地想着那男孩。也许失望和悲惨给了他有益的教训。如果他不曾悲惨过，他可能照样讨厌她。只有现在他才发现她是一个小小的安慰。跟那个“方特勒罗伊夫人”相对照，她几乎在任何一个方面都似乎令人赏心悦目。她的脸是那样的甜美，她的声音是那样的神圣。很快地，由于受到这些具有魔力的因素的影响，伯爵开始感到不那么阴郁了，然后，他谈得就更多了。

“不管发生什么事，”他说，“孩子会得到照顾的。现在和将来，他都会受到照顾的。”

在他离开之前，他扫视了一下屋子。

“你喜欢这屋子吗？”他问道。

“很喜欢。”她答道。

“这是一个充满快乐的房间，”他说，“我能再来细谈这事吗？”

“你愿意什么时候来都可以，老爷。”她答道。

随后，他走出了房间，上车走了。





第十三章　迪克来相救


当然啦，方特勒罗伊勋爵的故事和多林考特伯爵的困扰，一经英国报纸的讨论，就受到了美国报纸的报道。这故事太有趣了，所以报界不会轻易放过，它被谈论得很多很多。不同的说法是如此之多，以至于如果你把所有有关的报纸都买来，将它们互相比较一下，你会有所启发。霍布斯先生读了很多，但后来他自己也变得迷惑不解了。有一张报纸将他年幼的朋友塞德里克描写成一个还被抱在手里的娃娃——而另一张报纸则把塞德里克说成是牛津大学的青年学生，赢得了所有的奖励，并且通过写作希腊语诗歌脱颖而出；还有一张报纸说，他已经跟一个非常年轻漂亮的贵族小姐订了婚，那位小姐是一个公爵的女儿；另外有报纸说，他刚刚结婚。实际上，只有一点没有被报纸说到，即他是一个七八岁的小男孩，长着漂亮的双腿和卷曲的头发。别的说法还有，比如说他跟多林考特伯爵根本没有关系。多林考特家族的律师来到美国，寻找伯爵的继承人，他母亲欺骗了那个律师，而在此之前，他也只不过是一个小骗子，在纽约卖卖报纸，还露宿街头呢。报纸还说到了新出现的方特勒罗伊勋爵及其母亲。有时候把那个母亲说成是吉卜赛人，有时候说成是女演员，有时候说成是漂亮的西班牙女郎，但是大家一致认为，多林考特伯爵是她不共戴天的死对头，不愿意把她的儿子认作继承人。另外，由于她所提供的文件有问题，人们预料，此案将有一个漫长的审讯过程，那将比以往法庭上出现的任何情况都更加有趣。霍布斯先生经常读这些报纸，直读到脑袋发晕。晚上，他就和迪克一起，详细地谈论了此事。他们弄明白了，多林考特伯爵是多么重要的一个人物，他拥有多么可观的收入，还有多少领地，他住的城堡是多么庄严而美丽。他们读得越多，变得越兴奋。

“我们似乎应该做点什么。”霍布斯先生说。

但是，他们实际上能够做的，只不过是分别给塞德里克写了封信，信上强调了他们的友谊和同情。他们是一听说那个消息就写信的。写完后，他们互相交换着看了。

霍布斯先生在迪克的信中读到：





亲爱的朋友，我收到了你的来信，霍布斯先生也收到了你写给他的信。你倒霉了，为此我们感到很难过，我们要对你说尽可能地坚持不要让任何人抢在你前头。这世上有很多老贼，如果你让自己的眼睛受到蒙蔽的话，他们就会竭尽全力来利用你。不过我最想说的是我没有忘记你为我做的事，如果你没有别的更好的出路，你就回到这儿来跟我搭档干活。生意还不错，我保证你不会受到伤害，如果有人企图来抢夺生意，即使他是个大个子你也会迅速把他摆平的，因为有我普勒费塞·迪克·蒂普顿这个行家在。今天就谈这么多吧。

迪克





迪克在霍布斯先生的信中读到：





亲爱的阁下，你的信我已收到，信上说事情挺糟糕的，我相信这是一个预先设计好的阴谋，那些参与阴谋的人你应该擦亮眼睛好好盯着他们。保持镇定，我会找一个律师，我会做我所能做的一切。如果最糟糕的情况发生，对于我们来说这世上伯爵已经太多了，我杂货店的生意倒是需要一个搭档，这是为你准备的，等你长大了你会在这儿有家有朋友。

你真诚的　塞勒斯·霍布斯





“呃，”霍布斯先生说，“如果他不是伯爵的话，我们俩都会给他提供出路的。”

“你说得对，”迪克说，“我会站在他这边。如果我不喜欢那样一个一流的小家伙，我会被天打雷劈的。”

就在第二天上午，迪克的一个顾客使事情有了转折。他是一个刚刚开业的年轻律师，由于太年轻，他穷得不能再穷了，但他是一个聪明的、精力充沛的小伙子，敏锐又机灵，而且脾气很好。就在迪克的擦鞋摊旁边，他有一间简陋的办公室。迪克每天早上都为他擦鞋，他通常会对迪克友好地打声招呼，或者开个玩笑。

就在那天上午，当他把一只脚搁在供休息的小凳子上时，他手里拿着一张有插图的报纸——是一张很开明的报纸，上面登载着引人注目的人和事的照片。他刚刚把报纸看完。当迪克把他的最后一只鞋子擦亮时，他把报纸交给了迪克。

“这张报纸给你吧，迪克。”他说，“当你顺便去戴尔莫尼科店里去吃早饭时，你可以看看。里面有英国城堡的照片，还有英国伯爵的儿媳妇的照片。你应该熟悉一下贵族和绅士的情况，迪克。前面的照片是多林考特伯爵和方特勒罗伊夫人的。喂！我说，你出什么事了？”

他说到的照片登载在头版上，迪克盯着其中的一张，眼睛和嘴巴都张得大大的。他那轮廓分明的脸几乎兴奋得苍白了。

“多少钱，迪克？”那年轻人说，“是什么让你这么吃惊？”

迪克的表情看上去真的好像有什么大事发生了似的。他指着那张照片，照片的下面写着：

“要求正当权利的孩子的母亲（方特勒罗伊夫人）。”

这是一张漂亮女人的照片，她的眼睛大大的，黑色的大辫子盘在头上。

“是她！”迪克说，“天啊，我了解她比了解你还要多！”

那年轻人笑了起来。

“你是在什么地方见过她的，迪克？”他说，“在新港，还是上次你跑步去巴黎的时候？”

迪克完全意识不到这是句笑话。他开始收拾鞋刷子和其他东西，就好像他有要事要办，他得立即停下生意。

“您别介意。”迪克说，“我真的认识她！今儿上午我不干活了。”

从说这话之后，不到五分钟的时间里，迪克穿街走巷，来到了街道拐角处霍布斯先生的杂货店里。当霍布斯先生的目光穿过柜台，看见迪克手里拿着报纸，冲进店里时，他几乎不能相信自己的眼睛。迪克跑得上气不接下气，事实上，当他把报纸扔在柜台上时，他几乎气喘得连话都说不出来。

“喂！”霍布斯先生叫道，“喂！你带来了什么东西？”

“你看吧！”迪克气喘吁吁地说，“看照片上的那个女人！就是你看见的那张！她不是什么贵族，她不是！”他强烈地嘲笑道，“她可不是什么勋爵的妻子。如果她不是明娜——明娜，你就吃了我！无论在什么地方，我都能把她认出来，本也能。只要去问他就行。”

霍布斯先生倒在了座位上。

“我知道这是一个预先谋划好的圈套。”他说，“我早就知道，他们这么做，只是因为他是一个美国人！”

“阴谋！”迪克厌恶地大喊道，“是她，就是她谋划的。她一直很会耍阴谋诡计；我要告诉你，我看见她的照片时的感觉。在我们所看见的报纸的一个版面上，登载了一封信，信上说了些她的孩子的事，就是说那孩子的下巴上有一个伤疤。她的孩子跟我一样，绝对不能成为勋爵！因为那是本的孩子——那回，她飞起盘子打向我的时候，打中的就是这个孩子，所以留下了伤疤。”

迪克·蒂普顿一直是个敏锐的少年，他在大城市的大街上谋生，这使他变得更加敏锐。他学会了时刻睁大眼睛，对周围的事物保持警惕。必须承认，那一时刻，他非常兴奋、急躁。那天上午，如果小方特勒罗伊勋爵能够看到店里的情况，纵然迪克和霍布斯先生所有的讨论和计划，都是要决定另一个男孩子的而不是他的命运，他也肯定会很感兴趣。

霍布斯先生几乎被他自己的责任感给控制了，而迪克一直生机勃勃、充满活力。他开始给本写信，还把照片从报纸上剪下来，也装在信中，寄给了本。霍布斯先生给塞德里克和伯爵分别写了一封信。正在他们写信的过程中，突然迪克又想出了一个主意。

“听我说，”他说，“给我报纸的那个家伙，他是一个律师，咱们去问问他，咱们最好怎么干。律师们精通这一切。”

迪克的这个提议和迪克的办事能力，在霍布斯先生心中留下了很深的印象。

“就那么办！”他答道，“这事该请教律师。”

霍布斯先生把杂货店交给另一个人照管，匆匆忙忙地穿上外衣，跟迪克一起，迅速地走到城里。当他们俩在哈里森先生的办公室里，讲述那个离奇的故事时，那位年轻的律师大吃一惊。

如果他不是一个非常年轻的律师，很有进取心，而且手头有许多闲暇的时间，他可能不会对他们俩所讲的故事兴趣盎然，因为故事听起来实在是太稀奇古怪了、太荒唐无稽了。但是，他正好很想找点儿事干，而且他又正好认识迪克，迪克呢，又正好以一种非常显豁而生动的方式讲述了他的故事。

“还有，”霍布斯先生补充道，“说说你服务一个小时收多少钱，彻底将这件案子调查清楚又需要多少钱，我会赔偿你的损失的——我叫塞勒斯·霍布斯，在银行街的拐角处开了一家卖蔬菜和花朵等的杂货店。”

“呃，”哈里森先生说，“如果最后能查个水落石出，这将是一件大事，对于我，对于方特勒罗伊勋爵来说，这都将是一件大事。无论如何，调查不能给他造成任何伤害。那个孩子身上显示出了一些可疑之处。在关于孩子年龄的陈述中，那个女人是自相矛盾的，这引起了人们的怀疑。首先要给迪克的哥哥和多林考特伯爵的家庭律师写信。”

在太阳落山之前，两封信就已经写好了，分别寄给了两个地方——一封迅速地转出纽约港，乘着邮轮，奔向英国；另一封乘着一列开往加利福尼亚的旅客列车。头一封是寄给哈维沙姆先生的，第二封是寄给本加明·蒂普顿的。

那天晚上，杂货店打烊后，霍布斯和迪克坐在里屋中，一直交谈到午夜。





第十四章　真相大白


让人大为吃惊的是，在很短的时间内，非常奇妙的事情发生了。在霍布斯先生的杂货店里，那个小男孩坐在一只高凳子上，两条穿着红色裤子的小腿悬空着，仅仅在几分钟时间内，他的整个运气就翻了个个儿。他本来住在一条安宁的街道上，过着简朴的生活，突然变成了英国贵族，伯爵的继承人，拥有万贯家财。也仅仅在几分钟时间内，他又从英国贵族变回到了一个身无分文的小骗子，对他已经享受过了一段时间的荣华富贵，不再有任何权利。让人感到奇怪的是，他可能几乎没有足够的时间，来再一次预料这一切的变化，哪怕是表面的变化，他也预料不及。经历了一场危险，那失去的一切，重新又还给了他。

事情变化的时间之所以如此之短，是因为那个自称为方特勒罗伊夫人的女人，她的聪明远远比不上她的丑恶。当她受到哈维沙姆先生的详细盘问，回答有关她的婚姻和孩子的问题时，她犯了一两个大错误，这使哈维沙姆先生顿生怀疑。随后，她失去了正常的心态，脾气也变得暴躁起来，由于兴奋和生气，她更多地把自己给供出来了。她犯的所有错误都是有关她的孩子的。她曾经嫁给贝维斯，即方特勒罗伊勋爵，而且老是跟他吵架，最后拿了他的钱，不再去纠缠他，这似乎是没有疑问的。但是，她说孩子出生在伦敦的某个区域，哈维沙姆先生查明后现发，这不符合事实。就在他们因为这一发现而引起混乱之际，纽约那个年轻律师的信到了，霍布斯先生的信也到了。

接到那些信后，哈维沙姆先生和伯爵坐在书房里，密谋着他们的计划。那是怎么样的一个夜晚啊！

“头三次跟她见面后，”哈维沙姆先生说，“我就开始强烈地怀疑她。在我看来，那孩子似乎比她所说的要大一些。说到孩子的出生年月，她伪造了一张证件，随后又企图弥补其中的漏洞。这些信中所讲的事正好符合我的几个疑点。咱们最好的计划是——马上给这两个蒂普顿发海底电报，先不要对她谈起任何他们俩的事，趁她不备的时候，突然之间让她跟他们俩当面对质。她充其量只是一个非常愚笨的阴谋者罢了。我想，由于事先没有防备，她会被吓傻，会当场招供的。”

实际情况正是那样发生的。哈维沙姆先生没有向她泄露任何秘密，他通过不断地跟她面谈，使她确信他正在调查她的陈述，这避免了她的任何怀疑。她真的开始感到万无一失了，因此精神高涨，并且正如人们所能预料到的，她开始变得目空一切。

但是，一个晴朗的上午，当她正坐在起居室里，为自己制订着美妙无比的计划时，仆人通报说，哈维沙姆先生来了。当哈维沙姆先生走进房间时，他身后跟着至少三个人，一个是脸庞轮廓分明的少年，一个是高大的年轻人，第三个是多林考特伯爵。

她弹跳起来，发出了一声恐慌的叫喊。她还没来得及控制自己就喊出来了。几年来，她极少想起眼前这两个突然到来的人，一旦想起来，也觉得他们远在千里之外。她从未料到她会再次见到他们。必须承认的是，当迪克看见她的时候，露齿笑了一下。

“你好，明娜！”他说。

那个大个子年轻人——就是本——静静地站了一会儿，看着她。

“你认识她吗？”哈维沙姆先生问道，他的目光从本转向了明娜。

“是的。”本说，“我认识她，她也认识我。”他转身背对着她，走到窗前，站在那儿，望着窗外，就好像看见她都使他感到恶心似的，事实上他确实感到了恶心。随后，那女人明白了，自己的阴谋未能得逞，反而真相暴露了。她失去了控制，突然暴怒起来，本和迪克以前经常看见她暴怒的样子。当迪克看着她，听见她一一喊出他们的名字，还蛮横地威胁他们时，他笑得更开心了，而本则没有转回身来看她。

“我可以在任何一个法庭里对着她发誓，”本对哈维沙姆先生说，“我还可以带来一打愿意发誓的人。她父亲虽然生活在社会底层，但是一个受人尊敬的人。她母亲跟她一模一样，不过已经死了，但她父亲还活着，他非常诚实，会为她感到耻辱的。他会告诉您她是谁，以及她是否曾经跟我结过婚。”

随后，突然他的一只手紧握着，转向她。

“孩子在哪里？”他问道，“他得跟我在一起！跟你在一起，他会被你毁掉的，就像我被你毁掉一样！”

他刚刚说完这几句话，通向卧室的门开了一条缝。也许是被起居室里大声的说话吸引住了，一个男孩探头朝里望着。他长得并不漂亮，但是五官很端正。他很像他的父亲——本，这是任何人都能看出来的。他的下巴上果然有一处三角形的伤疤。

本急忙向孩子走去，抓起他的手。他自己的手颤抖着。

“是的，”他说，“我还可以对着他发誓。”他对孩子说，“我是你爸爸，汤姆，我是来接你走的。你的帽子呢？”

小男孩指着一把椅子，帽子就在上面。一听说他可以离开了，他明显露出了高兴的神情。他已经对奇怪的经历习以为常了，以至于一个陌生人自称是他父亲时，他都没有感到惊讶。几个月前，一个女人来到他的出生地（他从婴儿时代起就一直住在那儿），突然宣称是他母亲。他对她很是反感，心里一直在盼望转机的出现。这时，本拿起帽子，走到门口。

“如果你还需要我做什么事，”他对哈维沙姆先生说，“你知道在哪儿可以找到我。”

他抓着孩子的手，走出了房间，一眼都不看那个女人。她已经狂怒得有点疯疯癫癫了。伯爵透过眼镜，平静地盯着她。刚才，他悄悄地在他那贵族气息的鹰钩鼻上，戴上了眼镜。

“来，来，年轻的女人，”哈维沙姆先生说，“你这样做是没一点儿用的。如果你不想被监禁起来，就得举止规矩点儿。”

他用了一种非常公事公办的语调，这使她可能感觉到了，她所能做的最最安全的事，就是逃跑。她蛮横地瞪了他一眼，闪身经过他，跑进了隔壁房间，砰地关上了门。

“她再也不会麻烦我们了。”哈维沙姆先生说。

他说得对，就在那天晚上，她离开了多林考特阿姆斯，乘火车到了伦敦，从此不知所终。

面谈结束后，伯爵就离开了房间，立即走向马车。

“去罗奇苑。”他对托马斯说。

“去罗奇苑。”当托马斯爬上车厢时，他对车夫说，“事情发生了意料不到的转折。”

当马车停在罗奇苑时，塞德里克正在客厅里，跟他母亲待在一起呢。

伯爵走了进来，没有被发现。他看上去又高了一英寸左右，而且年轻了好多岁。他深陷的眼睛闪闪放光。

“方特勒罗伊勋爵，”他问道，“在哪里？”

埃罗尔夫人走上前来，她的脸颊上升起了一朵红晕。“他还是方特勒罗伊勋爵吗？”她问道，“是真的吗？”伯爵伸出了手，紧紧抓住她的手。

“是的，”他说，“他还是勋爵。”

然后，他把另一只手放在方特勒罗伊的肩膀上。

“方特勒罗伊，”他以他那随意的、权威性的语气说，“问问你母亲，她什么时候到城堡来看我们？”

方特勒罗伊用胳膊环抱着母亲的脖子。

“跟我们住在一起吧！”他喊道，“永远跟我们住在一起！”

伯爵看着埃罗尔夫人，埃罗尔夫人也看着伯爵。

老伯爵的神情极为认真。他已下定决心，马上安排这事。他开始想，跟他的继承人的母亲交个朋友，是很适宜的。

“您确实需要我住到城堡里去吗？”埃罗尔夫人温柔地、甜美地微笑着说。

“当然啦！”伯爵率直地说，“我们一直是需要你的，只是我们没有完全意识到这一点。我们希望你来城堡。”





第十五章　小勋爵过八岁生日


本带着他的儿子，回到了加利福尼亚的养牛场。一路上他感觉非常惬意。在他离开之前，哈维沙姆先生跟他见了面，告诉他多林考特伯爵希望为他的孩子做点儿事。伯爵决定投资建立一个属于他自己的养牛场，让本来负责管理。这能使本得到一笔相当高的收入，他可以存下一些，为他儿子的未来准备好资金。伯爵觉得这是一个好计划。于是，当本离开时，就将成为又一个农场的主人。新农场将和他自己的那个几乎一样好，而且到时候可能会轻而易举地变成他自己的农场。事实上，几年之后，他真的拥有了那个农场。他的儿子汤姆在农场长大，成了一个优秀的年轻人，而且非常热爱父亲。他们是如此成功、快乐，以至于本常常说，汤姆补偿了他曾经受过的所有苦难。

迪克和霍布斯先生——他们和其他人一起远渡重洋来到英国，看到事情得到了正当的解决——他们又待了一段时间才回美国。伯爵一开始就决定，他要资助迪克，让他接受教育；霍布斯先生则决定，要等着参加庆祝方特勒罗伊勋爵八岁生日的盛会。因为他已经把杂货店托付给一个可靠的人了，所以他能够再逗留一段时间。盛会上，所有的仆人都受到了邀请，人们在花园里吃着、跳着、玩着，晚上还燃起了篝火和烟火。

“就像七月四日国庆节似的！”方特勒罗伊勋爵说，“我的生日不在七月四日，这是一个遗憾，不是吗？如果是的话，我们就可以两个节日一起过了。”

必须承认，一开始，伯爵和霍布斯先生的关系并不像人们所希望的那样亲密，原因是伯爵平生几乎不认识杂货店里的人，而在霍布斯先生关系比较近的熟人中，贵族也不多。因此，在他们偶然见面时，谈话并不怎么投机，同时也必须承认，霍布斯先生为庄园的壮观所倾倒。方特勒罗伊觉得领着霍布斯先生参观庄园，是自己的义务。

开始的时候，入口处的大门、石狮子和大马路就使霍布斯先生有了些感受。待他看到城堡、花园、温室、台地、孔雀、地牢、盔甲、宽大的楼梯、马圈和穿着号衣的仆人，他真的被迷住了。不过，最终使他感触最深的似乎是画廊。

“有点儿像博物馆。”当他被领进那间宽敞、漂亮的房间时，他对方特勒罗伊说。

“呃——不像！”方特勒罗伊怀疑地说，“我觉得不像博物馆。我祖父说，这些都是我的祖先。”

“你姑姑的姐妹！”霍布斯先生脱口喊道，“她们全都是吗？那你的叔祖父肯定有一个大家庭了！他要养活所有这些人吗？”

他的身子倒进椅子里，环顾着四周，神情焦虑不安，直到方特勒罗伊勋爵费尽全力清楚地解释说，画墙并不完全是按照他叔祖父的后代的画像来划分的。

方特勒罗伊发现，很有必要去把梅隆夫人请来帮忙，因为她了解所有画像的情况，而且能说出是谁画的，什么时候画的，以及是谁把浪漫的故事加在老爷太太这些人物原型身上的。霍布斯先生听了几个故事之后，变得非常着迷，几乎没有什么其他东西比画廊更让他喜欢的了。他住在那个叫作多林考特阿姆斯的村子里，经常从那儿来到画廊里，花上半个小时左右，在画廊里走来走去，盯着画上的贵妇们和绅士们，他们也盯着他。

“他们可都是贵族啊！”他说，“至少是准贵族！塞德里克也要成为其中的一个了，而且将拥有所有这一切！”

他原来曾经预想，他对伯爵及其生活方式会厌恶至极，但是现在，他内心里并不那么讨厌伯爵了。在他细致熟悉了城堡及其历代的主人，还有所有其他的一切后，他那些严格的共和党原则是否一点都不受影响，也是存有疑问的。无论如何，有一天，他说出了一种非常不同凡响的、意料之外的感想。

“让我自己成为他们中的一员，我也不会介意的！”他说——这可真是极大的让步啊。

当小方特勒罗伊勋爵的生日到来时，那是多么辉煌的日子！花园看上去美不胜收！到处都是成群结队的人，他们穿着最好的、最好看的衣服。帐篷和城堡的顶上，旗帜飞扬！能够来的人都来了，大家都很高兴，因为小方特勒罗伊勋爵仍然是小方特勒罗伊勋爵，而且将来某一天，他将成为这一切的主人。每个人都想看看他，看看他那美丽而贤良的母亲。她已经在庄园里交了很多朋友。大家也确实更喜欢伯爵了，感到更容易接近他了，因为小家伙是如此喜爱他，信任他，也因为他自己现在像对待朋友似的对待小家伙的母亲了，而且对她表现出了尊敬。据说，伯爵甚至开始喜欢她了，而且在小勋爵及其母亲中间，伯爵有可能会变成一个举止相当高雅的老贵族。到那时，庄园里所有的人都可能会变得更加幸福、更加富裕。

树底下，帐篷里，草坪上，到处是成群结队的人！农夫农妇们像过节似的穿着漂亮的服装，戴着漂亮的帽子和围巾；姑娘们伴着她们的心上人；孩子们像鸟一样跑来跑去，互相追逐着；老妇们穿着大红的外套，聚集在一起说长道短。女士们和先生们纷纷到城堡里来看热闹，来祝贺伯爵，来拜见埃罗尔夫人。洛里耶尔夫人和哈里爵士、托马斯·阿什爵士和他的女儿们都来了，当然还有哈维沙姆先生；随后到来的，是美丽的维维安·贺波特小姐。她穿着最可爱的袍子，撑着花边阳伞。绅士们围着她，争着向她献殷勤——尽管在她的心目中，他们全部加起来，也不如一个方特勒罗伊，这是显而易见的。小家伙一见她，就跑了过去，用双臂抱着她的脖子，她也用双臂抱着他，热烈地吻着他，就好像他是她自己的可爱的小弟弟，她说：

“亲爱的小方特勒罗伊勋爵！亲爱的小家伙！我真高兴！我真高兴！”

说完，她跟他一起在庭院里走来走去，让他把每一件东西都指给她看。他带着她，来到了霍布斯先生和迪克住的地方，对她说：“这位是我的老朋友霍布斯先生，贺波特小姐，这位是我的另一个老朋友迪克，我告诉他们你漂亮极了，我还告诉他们，如果你来参加我的生日宴会的话，他们应该见见你。”她跟他们一一握手，以她最美丽的姿态，站着跟他们聊天，问他们有关美国的情况、旅途的情况以及到英国以来的生活情况。方特勒罗伊站在旁边，用爱慕的目光仰视着她。他的脸颊高兴得红彤彤的，因为他发现霍布斯先生和迪克也很喜欢她。

“哦，”事后，迪克严肃地说，“她像雏菊一样，是我平生见过的最最漂亮的女孩！她是——哦，她就是一朵雏菊，真是一朵雏菊，没错！”

当她走过的时候，每一个人的目光都追着她，也追着小方特勒罗伊勋爵。阳光照耀着，旗帜飘扬着，人们玩着游戏，跳着舞。当快乐的下午过去时，最最快乐的节目开始了。小勋爵高兴得浑身放光。

对他来说，整个世界似乎都美不胜收。

另一个人也非常快乐——那是一个老头，他虽然一生都过着富裕而高贵的生活，但一直都并不真正快乐。因为他比以前过得更好，所以感觉更加快乐。方特勒罗伊认为他很好，事实上，他不是突然变得那么好的，但是，至少可以说，他已经开始爱护别人了。孩子那小小的心灵单纯而善良，提示他要做点好事。有几次，他甚至从做好事中找到了快乐——那是一个良好的开端。他对儿媳妇也日益感到满意。正如人们所说的，他也真的开始喜欢她了。他喜欢听她甜美的声音，喜欢看她甜美的脸庞。当他坐在扶手椅中时，他常常看着她，听着她跟她儿子的谈话。他听到了温柔的爱的话语，他以前从未听到过这样的话语。他开始明白了，为什么小家伙虽然生活在纽约的小街上，结识杂货店老板，结交擦鞋匠，却照样很有教养，很有男子汉气概。甚至当命运把他变成了一个英国伯爵的继承人，生活在英国的城堡里，他也没有让任何人为他感到羞辱。

总的来说，这真的很容易解释——那只是因为他的身边有一颗善良的、温柔的心，那是他母亲的心。她教导他，要时刻心存善良的念头，要想着去关心别人。也许这事很小，却是最好的。塞德里克以前对伯爵和城堡一无所知，也不知道所有的这些宏大、壮观的事物，但他一直是惹人喜欢的，因为他单纯而且富于爱心。这样的一个人，生来就像一个国王。

生日那天，小勋爵在花园里走来走去，穿梭在人群之中，跟那些他认识的人攀谈。任何人向他打招呼时，他都会做出一个娴熟、小小的鞠躬动作。他逗得他的朋友迪克和霍布斯先生直发笑。有时候，他站在母亲或贺波特小姐身边，听着她们的谈话。多林考特老伯爵看着他，对他感到非常非常满意。多林考特领地上比较重要的佃户坐在最大的帐篷里，举行盛大的读经讨论会，当老伯爵跟小家伙一起到帐篷里去时，他感到了从未有过的满足。

佃户们正在祝酒。他们热情地为伯爵的健康干杯，以前伯爵的名字从来没有被如此热情地呼叫过。然后，他们又提议为小方特勒罗伊勋爵的健康干杯。如果此前，人们对老爷是否受欢迎这一问题一直有怀疑的话，那么那一刻这种怀疑就可以解除了。人声多么喧嚷！杯子的碰撞声和赞语响成一片！那些热心肠的人们开始喜欢伯爵了，女士们和先生们到城堡里来看他们，他们忘了任何约束的感觉，大方地高声喊着。一两个做了母亲的女人温柔地看着小家伙，他站着，一边是他母亲，另一边是伯爵。她们眼中噙着泪水，互相说道：

“上帝保佑他，漂亮的小亲亲！”

小方特勒罗伊勋爵听了很高兴。他站着，笑着，鞠着躬，满脸快乐的红晕像玫瑰一般，一直蔓延到光亮的头发的根梢。

“是因为她们喜欢我吗，最最亲爱的？”他对他母亲说，“是不是啊，最最亲爱的？我太高兴了！”

随后，伯爵举起手，放在孩子的肩膀上，对他说：

“方特勒罗伊，跟她们说，你感谢她们的好意。”

方特勒罗伊抬头瞥了他一眼，随后又看了看母亲。

“我必须那么做吗？”他有点害羞地问道。他母亲微笑着，贺波特小姐也微笑着，她们俩都点了点头。于是，他往前跨了一小步，大家都看着他——他是如此漂亮、单纯，他的脸色又是如此无所畏惧、深信不疑！——他那孩子气的声音波浪似的传开来，非常清晰、高亢，他用力高声说道：

“我非常非常感谢你们！”他说，“而且——我希望你们能分享我生日的快乐——因为我已享有太多的快乐——还有——我很高兴，我将成为伯爵——一开始我没想着我会喜欢当伯爵，但是现在我喜欢了——还有，我也爱上了这地方，我觉得这地方很美——还有——还有——还有，当我是一个伯爵的时候，我将努力成为像我祖父一样的好伯爵。”

在喧闹的喝彩和赞美声中，他退了回来，如释重负般地轻声呼了口气，把手放在伯爵的手里，紧紧地挨着伯爵站着，倚靠着老伯爵微笑着。

那就是我的故事的结尾了，但是我还必须加上一条奇怪的消息。霍布斯先生变得如此迷恋高贵的生活，不情愿离开他的小朋友，以至于他真的卖掉了纽约的杂货店，在英国的额勒斯波罗村里定居了下来，在城堡主人的关照下，他在村子里开了一家商店，后来生意还非常好。尽管他和伯爵一直没有成为密友，但是请你相信我，霍布斯这个普通人最后变得比贵族还贵族。每天早上，他要读宫廷新闻，一举一动全都模仿贵族议院！大概十年后，当迪克完成了学业，准备去加利福尼亚看望他的哥哥时，他问那个好心的杂货店老板，是否同意回美国，霍布斯先生严肃地摇摇头。

“我不想生活在那边了，”他说，“我不想生活在那边了，我想住在他的附近，以便照顾他。那个国家对他们来说固然是好得不能再好，朝气蓬勃而且激动人心——但也有问题——那儿没有三姑六姨，也没有伯爵！”

Chapter 1　A Great Surprise


Cedric himself knew nothing whatever about it. It had never been even mentioned to him. He knew that his papa had been an Englishman, because his mamma had told him so; but then his papa had died when he was so little a boy that he could not remember very much about him, except that he was big, and had blue eyes and a long mustache, and that it was a splendid thing to be carried around the room on his shoulder.

Since his papa's death, Cedric had found out that it was best not to talk to his mamma about him. When his father was ill, Cedric had been sent away, and when he had returned, everything was over; and his mother, who had been very ill, too, was only just beginning to sit in her chair by the window. She was pale and thin, and all the dimples had gone from her pretty face, and her eyes looked large and mournful, and she was dressed in black.

"Dearest," said Cedric (his papa had called her that always, and so the little boy had learned to say it), —"dearest, is my papa better?"

He felt her arms tremble, and so he turned his curly head and looked in her face. There was something in it that made him feel that he was going to cry.

"Dearest," he said, "is he well?"

Then suddenly his loving little heart told him that he'd better put both his arms around her neck and kiss her again and again, and keep his soft cheek close to hers; and he did so, and she laid her face on his shoulder and cried bitterly, holding him as if she could never let him go again.

"Yes, he is well," she sobbed; "he is quite, quite well, but we—we have no one left but each other. No one at all."

Then, little as he was, he understood that his big, handsome young papa would not come back any more; that he was dead, as he had heard of other people being, although he could not comprehend exactly what strange thing had brought all this sadness about.

It was because his mamma always cried when he spoke of his papa that he secretly made up his mind it was better not to speak of him very often to her, and he found out, too, that it was better not to let her sit still and look into the fire or out of the window without moving or talking. He and his mamma knew very few people, and lived what might have been thought very lonely lives, although Cedric did not know it was lonely until he grew older and heard why it was they had no visitors.

Then he was told that his mamma was an orphan, and quite alone in the world when his papa had married her. She was very pretty, and had been living as companion to a rich old lady who was not kind to her, and one day Captain Cedric Errol, who was calling at the house, saw her run up the stairs with tears on her eyelashes; and she looked so sweet and innocent and sorrowful that the Captain could not forget her. And after many strange things had happened, they knew each other well and loved each other dearly, and were married, although their marriage brought them the ill-will of several persons. The one who was most angry of all, however, was the Captain's father, who lived in England, and was a very rich and important old nobleman, with a very bad temper and a very violent dislike to America and Americans. He had two sons older than Captain Cedric; and it was the law that the elder of these sons should inherit the family title and estates, which were very rich and splendid; if the eldest son died, the next one would be heir; so, though he was a member of such a great family, there was little chance that Captain Cedric would be very rich himself.

But it so happened that Nature had given to the youngest son gifts which she had not bestowed upon his elder brothers. He had a beautiful face and a fine, strong, graceful figure; he had a bright smile and a sweet, gay voice; he was brave and generous, and had the kindest heart in the world, and seemed to have the power to make every one love him.

And it was not so with his elder brothers; neither of them was handsome, or very kind, or clever. When they were boys at Eton, they were not popular; when they were at college, they cared nothing for study, and wasted both time and money, and made few real friends.

The old Earl, their father, was constantly disappointed and humiliated by them; his heir was no honor to his noble name, and did not promise to end in being anything but a selfish, wasteful, insignificant man, with no manly or noble qualities. It was very bitter, the old Earl thought, that the son who was only third, and would have only a very small fortune, should be the one who had all the gifts, and all the charms, and all the strength and beauty. Sometimes he almost hated the handsome young man because he seemed to have the good things which should have gone with the stately title and the magnificent estates; and yet, in the depths of his proud, stubborn old heart, he could not help caring very much for his youngest son. It was in one of his fits of petulance that he sent him off to travel in America; he thought he would send him away for a while, so that he should not be made angry by constantly contrasting him with his brothers, who were at that time giving him a great deal of trouble by their wild ways.

But, after about six months, he began to feel lonely, and longed in secret to see his son again, so he wrote to Captain Cedric and ordered him home. The letter he wrote crossed on its way a letter the Captain had just written to his father, telling of his love for the pretty American girl, and of his intended marriage; and when the Earl received that letter he was furiously angry.

Bad as his temper was, he had never given way to it in his life as he gave way to it when he read the Captain's letter. His valet, who was in the room when it came, thought his lordship would have a fit of apoplexy, he was so wild with anger. For an hour he raged like a tiger, and then he sat down and wrote to his son, and ordered him never to come near his old home, nor to write to his father or brothers again. He told him he might live as he pleased, and die where he pleased, that he should be cut off from his family forever, and that he need never expect help from his father as long as he lived.

The Captain was very sad when he read the letter; he was very fond of England, and he dearly loved the beautiful home where he had been born; he had even loved his ill-tempered old father, and had sympathized with him in his disappointments; but he knew he need expect no kindness from him in the future.

At first he scarcely knew what to do; he had not been brought up to work, and had no business experience, but he had courage and plenty of determination.

So he sold his commission in the English army, and after some trouble found a situation in New York, and married. The change from his old life in England was very great, but he was young and happy, and he hoped that hard work would do great things for him in the future.

He had a small house on a quiet street, and his little boy was born there, and everything was so gay and cheerful, in a simple way, that he was never sorry for a moment that he had married the rich old lady's pretty companion just because she was so sweet and he loved her and she loved him.

She was very sweet, indeed, and her little boy was like both her and his father. Though he was born in so quiet and cheap a little home, it seemed as if there never had been a more fortunate baby.

In the first place, he was always well, and so he never gave any one trouble; in the second place, he had so sweet a temper and ways so charming that he was a pleasure to every one; and in the third place, he was so beautiful to look at that he was quite a picture.

Instead of being a bald-headed baby, he started in life with a quantity of soft, fine, gold-colored hair, which curled up at the ends, and went into loose rings by the time he was six months old; he had big brown eyes and long eyelashes and a darling little face; he had so strong a back and such splendid sturdy legs, that at nine months he learned suddenly to walk; his manners were so good, for a baby, that it was delightful to make his acquaintance. He seemed to feel that every one was his friend, and when any one spoke to him, when he was in his carriage in the street, he would give the stranger one sweet, serious look with the brown eyes, and then follow it with a lovely, friendly smile.

And the consequence was, that there was not a person in the neighborhood of the quiet street where he lived—even to the groceryman at the corner, who was considered the crossest creature alive—who was not pleased to see him and speak to him. And every month of his life he grew handsomer and more interesting.

When he was old enough to walk out with his nurse, dragging a small wagon and wearing a short white kilt skirt, and a big white hat set back on his curly yellow hair, he was so handsome and strong and rosy that he attracted every one's attention, and his nurse would come home and tell his mamma stories of the ladies who had stopped their carriages to look at and speak to him, and of how pleased they were when he talked to them in his cheerful little way, as if he had known them always. His greatest charm was this cheerful, fearless, quaint little way of making friends with people.

I think it arose from his having a very confiding nature, and a kind little heart that sympathized with every one, and wished to make every one as comfortable as he liked to be himself. It made him very quick to understand the feelings of those about him. Perhaps this had grown on him, too, because he had lived so much with his father and mother, who were always loving and considerate and tender and well-bred. He had never heard an unkind or uncourteous word spoken at home; he had always been loved and caressed and treated tenderly, and so his childish soul was full of kindness and innocent warm feeling. He had always heard his mamma called by pretty, loving names, and so he used them himself when he spoke to her; he had always seen that his papa watched over her and took great care of her, and so he learned, too, to be careful of her.

So when he knew his papa would come back no more, and saw how very sad his mamma was, there gradually came into his kind little heart the thought that he must do what he could to make her happy. He was not much more than a baby, but that thought was in his mind whenever he climbed upon her knee and kissed her and put his curly head on her neck, and when he brought his toys and picture-books to show her, and when he curled up quietly by her side as she used to lie on the sofa. He was not old enough to know of anything else to do, so he did what he could, and was more of a comfort to her than he could have understood.

"Oh, Mary!" he heard her say once to her old servant; "I am sure he is trying to help me in his innocent way—I know he is. He looks at me sometimes with a loving, wondering little look, as if he were sorry for me, and then he will come and pet me or show me something. He is such a little man, I really think he knows."

As he grew older, he had a great many quaint little ways which amused and interested people greatly. He was so much of a companion for his mother that she scarcely cared for any other. They used to walk together and talk together and play together. When he was quite a little fellow, he learned to read; and after that he used to lie on the hearth-rug, in the evening, and read aloud—sometimes stories, and sometimes big books such as older people read, and sometimes even the newspaper; and often at such times Mary, in the kitchen, would hear Mrs. Errol laughing with delight at the quaint things he said.

"And, indade," said Mary to the groceryman, "nobody cud help laughin' at the quare little ways of him—and his ould-fashioned sayin's! Didn't he come into my kitchen the noight the new Prisident was nominated and shtand afore the fire, lookin' loike a pictur', wid his hands in his shmall pockets, an' his innocent bit of a face as sayrious as a jedge? An' sez he to me: 'Mary,' sez he, 'I'm very much int'rusted in the 'lection,' sez he.'I'm a 'publican, an' so is Dearest. Are you a 'publican, Mary?' 'Sorra a bit,' sez I; 'I'm the bist o' dimmycrats!' An' he looks up at me wid a look that ud go to yer heart, an' sez he: 'Mary,' sez he, 'the country will go to ruin.' An' nivver a day since thin has he let go by widout argyin' wid me to change me polytics."

Mary was very fond of him, and very proud of him, too. She had been with his mother ever since he was born; and, after his father's death, had been cook and housemaid and nurse and everything else. She was proud of his graceful, strong little body and his pretty manners, and especially proud of the bright curly hair which waved over his forehead and fell in charming love-locks on his shoulders. She was willing to work early and late to help his mamma make his small and suits and keep them in order.

"Ristycratic, is it?" she would say. "Faith, an' I'd loike to see the choild on Fifth Avey-NOO as looks loike him an' shteps out as handsome as himself. An' ivvery man, woman, and child lookin' afther him in his bit of a black velvet skirt made out of the misthress's ould gownd; an' his little head up, an' his curly hair flyin' an' shinin'. It's loike a young lord he looks."

Cedric did not know that he looked like a young lord; he did not know what a lord was. His greatest friend was the grocery man at the corner—the cross groceryman, who was never cross to him. His name was Mr. Hobbs, and Cedric admired and respected him very much. He thought him a very rich and powerful person, he had so many things in his store, —prunes and figs and oranges and biscuits,—and he had a horse and wagon. Cedric was fond of the milkman and the baker and the apple-woman, but he liked Mr. Hobbs best of all, and was on terms of such intimacy with him that he went to see him every day, and often sat with him quite a long time, discussing the topics of the hour. It was quite surprising how many things they found to talk about—the Fourth of July, for instance. When they began to talk about the Fourth of July there really seemed no end to it. Mr. Hobbs had a very bad opinion of "the British," and he told the whole story of the Revolution, relating very wonderful and patriotic stories about the villainy of the enemy and the bravery of the Revolutionary heroes, and he even generously repeated part of the Declaration of Independence.

Cedric was so excited that his eyes shone and his cheeks were red and his curls were all rubbed and tumbled into a yellow mop. He could hardly wait to eat his dinner after he went home, he was so anxious to tell his mamma. It was, perhaps, Mr. Hobbs who gave him his first interest in politics. Mr. Hobbs was fond of reading the newspapers, and so Cedric heard a great deal about that was going on in Washington; and Mr. Hobbs would tell him whether the President was doing his duty or not. And once, when there was an election, he found it all quite grand, and probably but for Mr. Hobbs and Cedric the country might have been wrecked.

Mr. Hobbs took him to see a great torchlight procession, and many of the men who carried torches remembered afterward a stout man who stood near a lamp-post and held on his shoulder a handsome little shouting boy, who waved his cap in the air.

It was not long after this election, when Cedric was between seven and eight years old, that the very strange thing happened which made so wonderful a change in his life. It was quite curious, too, that the day it happened he had been talking to Mr. Hobbs about England and the Queen, and Mr. Hobbs had said some very severe things about the aristocracy, being specially indignant against earls and marquises. It had been a hot morning; and after playing soldiers with some friends of his, Cedric had gone into the store to rest, and had found Mr. Hobbs looking very fierce over a piece of the Illustrated London News, which contained a picture of some court ceremony.

"Ah," he said, "that's the way they go on now; but they'll get enough of it some day, when those they've trod on rise and blow 'em up sky-high,—earls and marquises and all! It's coming, and they may look out for it!"

Cedric had perched himself as usual on the high stool and pushed his hat back, and put his hands in his pockets in delicate compliment to Mr. Hobbs.

"Did you ever know many marquises, Mr. Hobbs?" Cedric inquired,—"or earls?"

"No," answered Mr. Hobbs, with indignation; "I guess not. I'd like to catch one of 'em inside here; that's all! I'll have no grasping tyrants sittin' 'round on my cracker-barrels!"

And he was so proud of the sentiment that he looked around proudly and mopped his forehead.

"Perhaps they wouldn't be earls if they knew any better," said Cedric, feeling some vague sympathy for their unhappy condition.

"Wouldn't they!" said Mr. Hobbs. "They just glory in it! It's in 'em. They're a bad lot."

They were in the midst of their conversation, when Mary appeared. Cedric thought she had come to buy some sugar, perhaps, but she had not. She looked almost pale and as if she were excited about something.

"Come home, darlint,"she said; "the misthrees is wantin' yez."

Cedric slipped down from his stool.

"Does she want me to go out with her, Mary?"he asked. "Goodmorining, Mr. Hobbs. I'll see you again."

He was surprised to see Mary staring at him in a dumfounded fashion, and he wondered why she kept shaking her head.

"What's the matter, Mary?" he said. "Is it the hot weather?"

"No," said Mary; "but there's strange things happenin' to us."

"Has the sun given Dearest a headache?" he inquired anxiously.

But it was not that. When he reached his own house there was a coupe standing before the door and some one was in the little parlor talking to his mamma. Mary hurried him upstairs and put on his best summer suit of cream-colored flannel, with the red scarf around his waist, and combed out his curly locks.

"Lords, is it?" he heard her say. "An' the nobility an' gintry. Och! bad cess to them! Lords, indade—worse luck."

It was really very puzzling, but he felt sure his mamma would tell him what all the excitement meant, so he allowed Mary to bemoan herself without asking many questions. When he was dressed, he ran downstairs and went into the parlor. A tall, thin old gentleman with a sharp face was sitting in an arm-chair. His mother was standing near by with a pale face, and he saw that there were tears in her eyes.

"Oh! Ceddie!" she cried out, and ran to her little boy and caught him in her arms and kissed him in a frightened, troubled way. "Oh! Ceddie, darling!"

The tall old gentleman rose from his chair and looked at Cedric with his sharp eyes. He rubbed his thin chin with his bony hand as he looked. He seemed not at all displeased.

"And so," he said at last, slowly,—"and so this is little Lord Fauntleroy."





Chapter 2　Cedric's Friends


There was never a more amazed little boy than Cedric during the week that followed; there was never so strange or so unreal a week. In the first place, the story his mamma told him was a very curious one. He was obliged to hear it two or three times before he could understand it. He could not imagine what Mr. Hobbs would think of it. It began with earls:his grandpapa, whom he had never seen, was an earl; and his eldest uncle, if he had not been killed by a fall from his horse, would have been an earl, too, in time; and after his death, his other uncle would have been an earl, if he had not died suddenly, in Rome, of a fever. After that, his own papa, if he had lived, would have been an earl, but, since they all had died and only Cedric was left, it appeared that HE was to be an earl after his grandpapa's death—and for the present he was Lord Fauntleroy.

He turned quite pale when he was first told of it.

"Oh! Dearest!" he said, "I should rather not be an earl. None of the boys are earls. Can't I NOT be one?"

But it seemed to be unavoidable. And when, that evening, they sat together by the open window looking out into the shabby street, he and his mother had a long talk about it. Cedric sat on his footstool, clasping one knee in his favorite attitude and wearing a bewildered little face rather red from the exertion of thinking. His grandfather had sent for him to come to England, and his mamma thought he must go.

"Because," she said, looking out of the window with sorrowful eyes, "I know your papa would wish it to be so, Ceddie. He loved his home very much; and there are many things to be thought of that a little boy can't quite understand. I should be a selfish little mother if I did not send you. When you are a man, you will see why."

Ceddie shook his head mournfully.

"I shall be very sorry to leave Mr. Hobbs," he said. "I'm afraid he'll miss me, and I shall miss him. And I shall miss them all."

When Mr. Havisham—who was the family lawyer of the Earl of Dorincourt, and who had been sent by him to bring Lord Fauntleroy to England—came the next day, Cedric heard many things. But, somehow, it did not console him to hear that he was to be a very rich man when he grew up, and that he would have castles here and castles there, and great parks and deep mines and grand estates and tenantry. He was troubled about his friend, Mr. Hobbs, and he went to see him at the store soon after breakfast, in great anxiety of mind.

He found him reading the morning paper, and he approached him with a grave demeanor. He really felt it would be a great shock to Mr. Hobbs to hear what had befallen him, and on his way to the store he had been thinking how it would be best to break the news.

"Hello!" said Mr. Hobbs. "Mornin'!"

"Good-morning," said Cedric.

He did not climb up on the high stool as usual, but sat down on a cracker-box and clasped his knee, and was so silent for a few moments that Mr. Hobbs finally looked up inquiringly over the top of his newspaper.

"Hello!" he said again.

Cedric gathered all his strength of mind together.

"Mr. Hobbs," he said,"do you remember what we were talking about yesterday morning?"

"Well," replied Mr. Hobbs,—"seems to me it was England."

"Yes," said Cedric; "But just when mary came for me, you know?"

Mr. Hobbs rubbed the back of his head.

"We WAS mentioning Queen Victoria and the aristocracy."

"Yes," said Cedric, rather hesitatingly, "and—and earls; don't you know?"

"Why, yes," returned Mr. Hobbs; "we DID touch 'em up a little; that's so!"

Cedric flushed up to the curly bang on his forehead. Nothing so embarrassing as this had ever happened to him in his life. He was a little afraid that it might be a trifle embarrassing to Mr. Hobbs, too.

"You said," he proceeded, "that you wouldn't have them sitting 'round on your cracker-barrels."

"So I did!" returned Mr. Hobbs, stoutly. "And I meant it. Let 'em try it—that's all!"

"Mr. Hobbs," said Cedric, "one is sitting on this box now!"

Mr. Hobbs almost jumped out of his chair.

"What!" he exclaimed.

"Yes," Cedric announced, with due modesty; " I am one—or I am going to be. I won't deceive you."

Mr. Hobbs looked agitated. He rose up suddenly and went to look at the thermometer.

"The mercury's got into your head!" he exclaimed, turning back to examine his young friend's countenance. "It IS a hot day! How do you feel? Got any pain? When did you begin to feel that way?"

He put his big hand on the little boy's hair. This was more embarrassing than ever.

"Thank you," said Ceddie; "I'm all right. There is nothing the matter with my head. I'm sorry to say it's true, Mr. Hobbs. That was what Mary came to take me home for. Mr. Havisham was telling my mamma, and he is a lawyer."

Mr. Hobbs sank into his chair and mopped his forehead with his handkerchief.

"ONE of us has got a sunstroke!" he exclaimed.

"No," returned Cedric, "we haven't. We shall have to make the best of it, Mr. Hobbs. Mr. Havisham came all the way from England to tell us about it. My grandpapa sent him."

Mr. Hobbs stared wildly at the innocent, serious little face before him.

"Who is your grandfather?" he asked.

Cedric put his hand in his pocket and carefully drew out a piece of paper, on which something was written in his own round, irregular hand.

"I couldn't easily remember it, so I wrote it down on this," he said. And he read aloud slowly: "'John Arthur Molyneux Errol, Earl of Dorincourt.' That is his name, and he lives in a castle—in two or three castles, I think. And my papa, who died, was his youngest son; and I shouldn't have been a lord or an earl if my papa hadn't died; and my papa wouldn't have been an earl if his two brothers hadn't died. But they all died, and there is no one but me,—no boy,—and so I have to be one; and my grandpapa has sent for me to come to England."

Mr. Hobbs seemed to grow hotter and hotter. He mopped his forehead and his bald spot and breathed hard. He began to see that something very remarkable had happened; but when he looked at the little boy sitting on the cracker-box, with the innocent, anxious expression in his childish eyes, and saw that he was not changed at all, but was simply as he had been the day before, just a handsome, cheerful, brave little fellow in a blue suit and red neck-ribbon, all this information about the nobility bewildered him. He was all the more bewildered because Cedric gave it with such ingenuous simplicity, and plainly without realizing himself how stupendous it was.

"Wha—what did you say your name was?" Mr. Hobbs inquired.

"It's Cedric Errol, Lord Fauntleroy," answered Cedric. "That was what Mr. Havisham called me. He said when I went into the room: 'And so this is little Lord Fauntleroy!'"

"Well," said Mr. Hobbs, "I'll be—jiggered!"

This was an exclamation he always used when he was very much astonished or excited. He could think of nothing else to say just at that puzzling moment.

Cedric felt it to be quite a proper and suitable ejaculation. His respect and affection for Mr. Hobbs were so great that he admired and approved of all his remarks. He had not seen enough of society as yet to make him realize that sometimes Mr. Hobbs was not quite conventional. He knew, of course, that he was different from his mamma, but, then, his mamma was a lady, and he had an idea that ladies were always different from gentlemen.

He looked at Mr. Hobbs wistfully.

"England is a long way off, isn't it?" he asked.

"It's across the Atlantic Ocean," Mr. Hobbs answered.

"That's the worst of it," said Cedric."Perhaps I shall not see you again for a long time. I don't like to think of that, Mr. Hobbs."

"The best of friends must part," said Mr. Hobbs.

"Well," said Cedric, "we have been friends for a great many years, haven't we?"

"Ever since you was born," Mr. Hobbs answered. "You was about six weeks old when you was first walked out on this street."

"Ah," remarked Cedric, with a sigh, "I never thought I should have to be an earl then!"

"You think," said Mr. Hobbs, "there's no getting out of it?"

"I'm afraid not," answered Cedric. "My mamma says that my papa would wish me to do it. But if I have to be an earl, there's one thing I can do: I can try to be a good one. I'm not going to be a tyrant. And if there is ever to be another war with America, I shall try to stop it."

His conversation with Mr. Hobbs was a long and serious one. Once having got over the first shock, Mr. Hobbs was not so rancorous as might have been expected; he endeavored to resign himself to the situation, and before the interview was at an end he had asked a great many questions. As Cedric could answer but few of them, he endeavored to answer them himself, and, being fairly launched on the subject of earls and marquises and lordly estates, explained many things in a way which would probably have astonished Mr. Havisham, could that gentleman have heard it.

But then there were many things which astonished Mr. Havisham. He had spent all his life in England, and was not accustomed to American people and American habits. He had been connected professionally with the family of the Earl of Dorincourt for nearly forty years, and he knew all about its grand estates and its great wealth and importance; and, in a cold, business-like way, he felt an interest in this little boy, who, in the future, was to be the master and owner of them all,—the future Earl of Dorincourt. He had known all about the old Earl's disappointment in his elder sons and all about his fierce rage at Captain Cedric's American marriage, and he knew how he still hated the gentle little widow and would not speak of her except with bitter and cruel words. He insisted that she was only a common American girl, who had entrapped his son into marrying her because she knew he was an earl's son. The old lawyer himself had more than half believed this was all true. He had seen a great many selfish, mercenary people in his life, and he had not a good opinion of Americans. When he had been driven into the cheap street, and his coupe had stopped before the cheap, small house, he had felt actually shocked. It seemed really quite dreadful to think that the future owner of Dorincourt Castle and Wyndham Towers and Chorlworth, and all the other stately splendors, should have been born and brought up in an insignificant house in a street with a sort of green-grocery at the corner. He wondered what kind of a child he would be, and what kind of a mother he had. He rather shrank from seeing them both. He had a sort of pride in the noble family whose legal affairs he had conducted so long, and it would have annoyed him very much to have found himself obliged to manage a woman who would seem to him a vulgar, money-loving person, with no respect for her dead husband's country and the dignity of his name. It was a very old name and a very splendid one, and Mr. Havisham had a great respect for it himself, though he was only a cold, keen, business-like old lawyer.

When Mary handed him into the small parlor, he looked around it critically. It was plainly furnished, but it had a home-like look; there were no cheap, common ornaments, and no cheap, gaudy pictures; the few adornments on the walls were in good taste and about the room were many pretty things which a woman's hand might have made.

"Not at all bad so far," he had said to himself; "but perhaps the Captain's taste predominated." But when Mrs. Errol came into the room, he began to think she herself might have had something to do with it.If he had not been quite a self-contained and stiff old gentlemen, he would probably have started when he saw her. She looked, in the simple black dress, fitting closely to her slender figure, more like a young girl than the mother of a boy of seven. She had a pretty, sorrowful, young face, and a very tender, innocent look in her large brown eyes, —the sorrowful look that had never quite left her face since her husband had died. Cedric was used to seeing it there; the only times he had ever seen it fade out had been when he was playing with her or talking to her, and had said some old-fashioned thing, or used some long word he had picked up out of the newspapers or in his conversations with Mr. Hobbs. He was fond of using long words, and he was always pleased when they made her laugh, though he could not understand why they were laughable; they were quite serious matters with him. The lawyer's experience taught him to read people's characters very shrewdly, and as soon as he saw Cedric's mother he knew that the old Earl had made a great mistake in thinking her a vulgar, mercenary woman. Mr. Havisham had never been married, he had never even been in love, but he divined that this pretty young creature with the sweet voice and sad eyes had married Captain Errol only because she loved him with all her affectionate heart, and that she had never once thought it an advantage that he was an earl's son. And he saw he should have no trouble with her, and he began to feel that perhaps little Lord Fauntleroy might not be such a trial to his noble family, after all. The Captain had been a handsome fellow, and the young mother was very pretty, and perhaps the boy might be well enough to look at.

When he first told Mrs. Errol what he had come for, she turned very pale.

"Oh!" she said; "will he have to be taken away from me? We love each other so much! He is such a happiness to me! He is all I have. I have tried to be a good mother to him." And her sweet young voice trembled, and the tears rushed into her eyes. "You do not know what he has been to me!" she said.

The lawyer cleared his throat.

"I am obliged to tell you," he said, "that the Earl of Dorincourt is not—is not very friendly toward you. He is an old man, and his prejudices are very strong. He has always especially disliked America and Americans, and was very much enraged by his son's marriage. I am sorry to be the bearer of so unpleasant a communication, but he is very fixed in his determination not to see you. His plan is that Lord Fauntleroy shall be educated under his own supervision; that he shall live with him. The Earl is attached to Dorincourt Castle, and spends a great deal of time there. He is a victim toin flammatory gout, and is not fond of London. Lord Fauntleroy will, therefore, be likely to live chiefly at Dorincourt. The Earl offers you as a home Court Lodge, which is situated pleasantly, and is not very far from the castle. He also offers you a suitable income. Lord Fauntleroy will be permitted to visit you; the only stipulation is, that you shall not visit him or enter the park gates. You see you will not be really separated from your son, and I assure you, madam, the terms are not so harsh as—as they might have been. The advantage of such surroundings and education as Lord Fauntleroy will have, I am sure you must see, will be very great."

He felt a little uneasy lest she should begin to cry or make a scene, as he knew some women would have done. It embarrassed and annoyed him to see women cry.

But she did not. She went to the window and stood with her face turned away for a few moments, and he saw she was trying to steady herself.

"Captain Errol was very fond of Dorincourt," she said at last. "He loved England, and everything English. It was always a grief to him that he was parted from his home. He was proud of his home, and of his name. He would wish—I know he would wish that his son should know the beautiful old places, and be brought up in such a way as would be suitable to his future position."

Then she came back to the table and stood looking up at Mr. Havisham very gently.

"My husband would wish it," she said. "It will be best for my little boy. I know—I am sure the Earl would not be so unkind as to try to teach him not to love me; and I know—even if he tried—that my little boy is too much like his father to be harmed. He has a warm, faithful nature, and a true heart. He would love me even if he did not see me; and so long as we may see each other, I ought not to suffer very much."

"She thinks very little of herself," the lawyer thought. "She does not make any terms for herself."

"Madam," he said aloud, "I respect your consideration for your son. He will thank you for it when he is a man. I assure you Lord Fauntleroy will be most carefully guarded, and every effort will be used to insure his happiness. The Earl of Dorincourt will be as anxious for his comfort and well-being as you yourself could be."

"I hope," said the tender little mother, in a rather broken voice, "that his grandfather will love Ceddie. The little boy has a very affectionate nature; and he has always been loved."

Mr. Havisham cleared his throat again. He could not quite imagine the gouty, fiery-tempered old Earl loving any one very much; but he knew it would be to his interest to be kind, in his irritable way, to the child who was to be his heir. He knew, too, that if Ceddie were at all a credit to his name, his grandfather would be proud of him.

"Lord Fauntleroy will be comfortable, I am sure," he replied. "It was with a view to his happiness that the Earl desired that you should be near enough to him to see him frequently."

He did not think it would be discreet to repeat the exact words the Earl had used, which were in fact neither polite nor amiable.

Mr. Havisham preferred to express his noble patron's offer in smoother and more courteous language.

He had another slight shock when Mrs. Errol asked Mary to find her little boy and bring him to her, and Mary told her where he was.

"Sure I'll foind him aisy enough, ma'am," she said; "for it's wid Mr. Hobbs he is this minnit, settin' on his high shtool by the counther an' talkin' pollytics, most loikely, or enj 'yin' hisself among the soap an' candles an' pertaties, as sinsible an' shwate as ye plase."

"Mr. Hobbs has known him all his life," Mrs. Errol said to the lawyer. "He is very kind to Ceddie, and there is a great friendship between them."

Remembering the glimpse he had caught of the store as he passed it, and having a recollection of the barrels of potatoes and apples and the various odds and ends, Mr. Havisham felt his doubts arise again. In England, gentlemen's sons did not make friends of grocerymen, and it seemed to him a rather singular proceeding. It would be very awkward if the child had bad manners and a disposition to like low company. One of the bitterest humiliations of the old Earl's life had been that his two elder sons had been fond of low company. Could it be, he thought, that this boy shared their bad qualities instead of his father's good qualities?

He was thinking uneasily about this as he talked to Mrs. Errol until the child came into the room. When the door opened, he actually hesitated a moment before looking at Cedric. It would, perhaps, have seemed very queer to a great many people who knew him, if they could have known the curious sensations that passed through Mr. Havisham when he looked down at the boy, who ran into his mother's arms. He experienced a revulsion of feeling which was quite exciting. He recognized in an instant that here was one of the finest and handsomest little fellows he had ever seen. His beauty was something unusual. He had a strong, lithe, graceful little body and a manly little face; he held his childish head up, and carried himself with a brave air; he was so like his father that it was really startling; he had his father's golden hair and his mother's brown eyes, but there was nothing sorrowful or timid in them. They were innocently fearless eyes; he looked as if he had never feared or doubted anything in his life.

"He is the best-bred-looking and handsomest little fellow I ever saw," was what Mr. Havisham thought. What he said aloud was simply, "And so this is little Lord Fauntleroy."

And, after this, the more he saw of little Lord Fauntleroy, the more of a surprise he found him. He knew very little about children, though he had seen plenty of them in England—fine, handsome, rosy girls and boys, who were strictly taken care of by their tutors and governesses, and who were sometimes shy, and sometimes a trifle boisterous, but never very interesting to a ceremonious, rigid old lawyer. Perhaps his personal interest in little Lord Fauntleroy's fortunes made him notice Ceddie more than he had noticed other children; but, however that was, he certainly found himself noticing him a great deal.

Cedric did not know he was being observed, and he only behaved himself in his ordinary manner. He shook hands with Mr. Havisham in his friendly way when they were introduced to each other, and he answered all his questions with the unhesitating readiness with which he answered Mr. Hobbs. He was neither shy nor bold, and when Mr. Havisham was talking to his mother, the lawyer noticed that he listened to the conversation with as much interest as if he had been quite grown up.

"He seems to be a very mature little fellow," Mr. Havisham said to the mother.

"I think he is, in some things," she answered. "He has always been very quick to learn, and he has lived a great deal with grownup people. He has a funny little habit of using long words and expressions he has read in books, or has heard others use, but he is very fond of childish play. I think he is rather clever, but he is a very boyish little boy, sometimes."

The next time Mr. Havisham met him, he saw that this last was quite true. As his coupe turned the corner, he caught sight of a group of small boys, who were evidently much excited. Two of them were about to run a race, and one of them was his young lordship, and he was shouting and making as much noise as the noisiest of his companions. He stood side by side with another boy, one little red leg advanced a step.

"One, to make ready!" yelled the starter. "Two, to be steady. Three—and away!"

Mr. Havisham found himself leaning out of the window of his coupe with a curious feeling of interest. He really never remembered having seen anything quite like the way in which his lordship's lordly little red legs flew up behind his knickerbockers and tore over the ground as he shot out in the race at the signal word. He shut his small hands and set his face against the wind; his bright hair streamed out behind.

"Hooray, Ced Errol!" all the boys shouted, dancing and shrieking with excitement. "Hooray, Billy Williams! Hooray, Ceddie! Hooray, Billy! Hooray! 'Ray! 'Ray!"

"I really believe he is going to win," said Mr. Havisham. The way in which the red legs flew and flash up and down, the shrieks of the boys, the wild efforts of Billy Williams, whose brown legs were not to be despised, as they followed closely in the rear of the red legs, made him feel some excitement. "I really—I really can't help hoping he will win!" he said, with an apologetic sort of cough.

At that moment, the wildest yell of all went up from the dancing, hopping boys. With one last frantic leap the future Earl of Dorincourt had reached the lamp-post at the end of the block and touched it, just two seconds before Billy Williams flung himself at it, panting.

"Three cheers for Ceddie Errol!" yelled the little boys. "Hooray for Ceddie Errol!"

Mr. Havisham drew his head in at the window of his coupe and leaned back with a dry smile.

"Bravo, Lord Fauntleroy!" he said.

As his carriage stopped before the door of Mrs. Errol's house, the victor and the vanquished were coming toward it, attended by the clamoring crew. Cedric walked by Billy Williams and was speaking to him. His elated little face was very red, his curls clung to his hot, moist forehead, his hands were in his pockets.

"You see," he was saying, evidently with the intention of making defeat easy for his unsuccessful rival, "I guess I won because my legs are a little longer than yours. I guess that was it. You see, I'm three days older than you, and that gives me a 'vantage. I'm three days older."

And this view of the case seemed to cheer Billy Williams so much that he began to smile on the world again, and felt able to swagger a little, almost as if he had won the race instead of losing it. Somehow, Ceddie Errol had a way of making people feel comfortable. Even in the first flush of his triumphs, he remembered that the person who was beaten might not feel so gay as he did, and might like to think that he MIGHT have been the winner under different circumstances.

That morning Mr. Havisham had quite a long conversation with the winner of the race—a conversation which made him smile his dry smile, and rub his chin with his bony hand several times.

Mrs. Errol had been called out of the parlor, and the lawyer and Cedric were left together. At first Mr. Havisham wondered what he should say to his small companion. He had an idea that perhaps it would be best to say several things which might prepare Cedric for meeting his grandfather, and, perhaps, for the great change that was to come to him. He could see that Cedric had not the least idea of the sort of thing he was to see when he reached England, or of the sort of home that waited for him there. He did not even know yet that his mother was not to live in the same house with him. They had thought it best to let him get over the first shock before telling him.

Mr. Havisham sat in an arm-chair on one side of the open window; on the other side was another still larger chair, and Cedric sat in that and looked at Mr. Havisham. He sat well back in the depths of his big seat, his curly head against the cushioned back, his legs crossed, and his hands thrust deep into his pockets, in a quite Mr. Hobbs-like way. He had been watching Mr. Havisham very steadily when his mamma had been in the room, and after she was gone he still looked at him in respectful thoughtfulness. There was a short silence after Mrs. Errol went out, and Cedric seemed to be studying Mr. Havisham, and Mr. Havisham was certainly studying Cedric. He could not make up his mind as to what an elderly gentleman should say to a little boy who won races, and wore short knickerbockers and red stockings on legs which were not long enough to hang over a big chair when he sat well back in it.

But Cedric relieved him by suddenly beginning the conversation himself.

"Do you know," he said, "I don't know what an earl is?"

"Don't you?" said Mr. Havisham.

"No," replied Ceddie. "And I think when a boy is going to be one, he ought to know. Don't you?"

"Well—yes," answered Mr. Havisham.

"Would you mind," said Ceddie respectfully—"would you mind, splaining it to me?" (Sometimes when he used his long words he did not pronounce them quite correctly.) "What made him an earl?"

"A king or queen, in the first place," said Mr. Havisham. "Generally, he is made an earl because he has done some service to his sovereign, or some great deed."

"Oh!" said Cedric; "that's like the President."

"Is it?" said Mr. Havisham. "Is that why your presidents are elected?"

"Yes," answered Ceddie cheerfully. "When a man is very good and knows a great deal, he is elected president. They have torch-light processions and bands, and everybody makes speeches. I used to think I might perhaps be a president, but I never thought of being an earl. I didn't know about earls," he said, rather hastily, lest Mr. Havisham might feel it impolite in him not to have wished to be one,—"if I'd known about them, I dare say I should have thought I should like to be one."

"It is rather different from being a president," said Mr. Havisham.

"Is it?" asked Cedric. "How? Are there no torch-light processions?"

Mr. Havisham crossed his own legs and put the tips of his fingers carefully together. He thought perhaps the time had come to explain matters rather more clearly.

"An earl is—is a very important person," he began.

"So is a president!" put in Ceddie. "The torch-light processions are five miles long, and they shoot up rockets, and the band plays! Mr. Hobbs took me to see them."

"An earl," Mr. Havisham went on, feeling rather uncertain of his ground, "is frequently of very ancient lineage—"

"What's that?" asked Ceddie.

"Of very old family—extremely old."

"Ah!" said Cedric, thrusting his hands deeper into his pockets. "I suppose that is the way with the apple-woman near the park. I dare say she is of ancient lin-lenage. She is so old it would surprise you how she can stand up. She's a hundred, I should think, and yet she is out there when it rains, even. I'm sorry for her, and so are the other boys. Billy Williams once had nearly a dollar, and I asked him to buy five cents' worth of apples from her every day until he had spent it all. That made twenty days, and he grew tired of apples after a week; but then—it was quite fortunate—a gentleman gave me fifty cents and I bought apples from her instead. You feel sorry for any one that's so poor and has such ancient lin-lenage. She says hers has gone into her bones and the rain makes it worse."

Mr. Havisham felt rather at a loss as he looked at his companion's innocent, serious little face.

"I am afraid you did not quite understand me," he explained. "When I said 'ancient lineage' I did not mean old age; I meant that the name of such a family has been known in the world a long time; perhaps for hundreds of years persons bearing that name have been known and spoken of in the history of their country."

"Like George Washington," said Ceddie. "I've heard of him ever since I was born, and he was known about, long before that. Mr. Hobbs says he will never be forgotten. That's because of the Declaration of Independence, you know, and the Fourth of July. You see, he was a very brave man."

"The first Earl of Dorincourt," said Mr. Havisham solemnly, "was created an earl four hundred years ago."

"Well, well!" said Ceddie. "That was a long time ago! Did you tell Dearest that? It would int'rust her very much. We'll tell her when she comes in. She always likes to hear cur'us things. What else does an earl do besides being created?"

"A great many of them have helped to govern England. Some of them have been brave men and have fought in great battles in the old days."

"I should like to do that myself," said Cedric. "My papa was a soldier, and he was a very brave man—as brave as George Washington. Perhaps that was because he would have been an earl if he hadn't died. I am glad earls are brave. That's a great 'vantage—to be a brave man. Once I used to be rather afraid of things—in the dark, you know; but when I thought about soldiers in the Revolution and George Washington—it cured me."

"There is another advantage in being an earl, sometimes," said Mr. Havisham slowly, and he fixed his shrewd eyes on the little boy with a rather curious expression. "Some earls have a great deal of money."

He was curious because he wondered if his young friend knew what the power of money was.

"That's a good thing to have," said Ceddie innocently. "I wish I had a great deal of money."

"Do you?" said Mr. Havisham. "And why?"

"Well," explained Cedric, "there are so many things a person can do with money. You see, there's the apple-woman. If I were very rich I should buy her a little tent to put her stall in, and a little stove, and then I should give her a dollar every morning it rained, so that she could afford to stay at home. And then—oh! I'd give her a shawl. And, you see, her bones wouldn't feel so badly. Her bones are not like our bones; they hurt her when she moves. It's very painful when your bones hurt you. If I were rich enough to do all those things for her, I guess her bones would be all right."

"Ahem!" said Mr. Havisham. "And what else would you do if you were rich?"

"Oh! I'd do a great many things. Of course I should buy Dearest all sorts of beautiful things, needle-books and fans and gold thimbles and rings, and an encyclopedia, and a carriage, so that she needn't have to wait for the street-cars. If she liked pink silk dresses, I should buy her some, but she likes black best. But I'd, take her to the big stores, and tell her to look 'round and choose for herself. And then Dick—"

"Who is Dick?" asked Mr. Havisham.

"Dick is a boot-black," said his young lordship, quite warming up in his interest in plans so exciting. "He is one of the nicest boot-blacks you ever knew. He stands at the corner of a street down-town. I've known him for years. Once when I was very little, I was walking out with Dearest, and she bought me a beautiful ball that bounced, and I was carrying it and it bounced into the middle of the street where the carriages and horses were, and I was so disappointed, I began to cry—I was very little. I had kilts on. And Dick was blacking a man's shoes, and he said 'Hello!' and he ran in between the horses and caught the ball for me and wiped it off with his coat and gave it to me and said, 'It's all right, young un.' So Dearest admired him very much, and so did I, and ever since then, when we go down-town, we talk to him. He says 'Hello!' and I say 'Hello!' and then we talk a little, and he tells me how trade is. It's been bad lately."

"And what would you like to do for him?" inquired the lawyer, rubbing his chin and smiling a queer smile.

"Well," said Lord Fauntleroy, settling himself in his chair with a business air, "I'd buy Jake out."

"And who is Jake?" Mr. Havisham asked.

"He's Dick's partner, and he is the worst partner a fellow could have! Dick says so. He isn't a credit to the business, and he isn't square. He cheats, and that makes Dick mad. It would make you mad, you know, if you were blacking boots as hard as you could, and being square all the time, and your partner wasn't square at all. People like Dick, but they don't like Jake, and so sometimes they don't come twice. So if I were rich, I'd buy Jake out and get Dick a 'boss' sign—he says a 'boss' sign goes a long way; and I'd get him some new clothes and new brushes, and start him out fair. He says all he wants is to start out fair."

There could have been nothing more confiding and innocent than the way in which his small lordship told his little story, quoting his friend Dick's bits of slang in the most candid good faith. He seemed to feel not a shade of a doubt that his elderly companion would be just as interested as he was himself. And in truth Mr. Havisham was beginning to be greatly interested; but perhaps not quite so much in Dick and the apple-woman as in this kind little lordling, whose curly head was so busy, under its yellow thatch, with good-natured plans for his friends, and who seemed somehow to have forgotten himself altogether.

"Is there anything—" he began. "What would you get for yourself, if you were rich?"

"Lots of things!" answered Lord Fauntleroy briskly; "but first I'd give Mary some money for Bridget—that's her sister, with twelve children, and a husband out of work. She comes here and cries, and Dearest gives her things in a basket, and then she cries again, and says: 'Blessin's be on yez, for a beautiful lady.' And I think Mr. Hobbs would like a gold watch and chain to remember me by, and a meerschaum pipe. And then I'd like to get up a company."

"A company!" exclaimed Mr. Havisham.

"Like a Republican rally," explained Cedric, becoming quite excited. "I'd have torches and uniforms and things for all the boys and myself, too. And we'd march, you know, and drill. That's what I should like for myself, if I were rich."

The door opened and Mrs. Errol came in.

"I am sorry to have been obliged to leave you so long," she said to Mr. Havisham; "but a poor woman, who is in great trouble, came to see me."

"This young gentleman," said Mr. Havisham, "has been telling me about some of his friends, and what he would do for them if he were rich."

"Bridget is one of his friends," said Mrs. Errol; "and it is Bridget to whom I have been talking in the kitchen. She is in great trouble now because her husband has rheumatic fever."

Cedric slipped down out of his big chair.

"I think I'll go and see her," he said, "and ask her how he is. He's a nice man when he is well. I'm obliged to him because he once made me a sword out of wood. He's a very talented man."

He ran out of the room, and Mr. Havisham rose from his chair. He seemed to have something in his mind which he wished to speak of.

He hesitated a moment, and then said, looking down at Mrs. Errol:

"Before I left Dorincourt Castle, I had an interview with the Earl, in which he gave me some instructions. He is desirous tha this grandson should look forward with some pleasure to his future life in England, and also to his acquaintance with himself. He said that I must let his lordship know that the change in his life would bring him money and the pleasures children enjoy; if he expressed any wishes, I was to gratify them, and to tell him that his grand-father had given him what he wished. I am aware that the Earl did not expect anything quite like this; but if it would give Lord Fauntleroy pleasure to assist this poor woman, I should feel that the Earl would be displeased if he were not gratified."

For the second time, he did not repeat the Earl's exact words. His lordship had, indeed, said:

"Make the lad understand that I can give him anything he wants. Let him know what it is to be the grandson of the Earl of Dorincourt. Buy him everything he takes a fancy to; let him have money in his pockets, and tell him his grandfather put it there."

His motives were far from being good, and if he had been dealing with a nature less affectionate and warm-hearted than little Lord Fauntleroy 's, great harm might have been done. And Cedric's mother was too gentle to suspect any harm. She thought that perhaps this meant that a lonely, unhappy old man, whose children were dead, wished to be kind to her little boy, and win his love and confidence. And it pleased her very much to think that Ceddie would be able to help Bridget. It made her happier to know that the very first result of the strange fortune which had befallen her little boy was that he could do kind things for those who needed kindness. Quite a warm color bloomed on her pretty young face.

"Oh!" she said, "that was very kind of the Earl; Cedric will be so glad! He has always been fond of Bridget and Michael.They are quite deserving. I have often wished I had been able to help them more. Michael is a hard-working man when he is well, but he has been ill a long time and needs expensive medicines and warm clothing and nourishing food. He and Bridget will not be wasteful of what is given them."

Mr. Havisham put his thin hand in his breast pocket and drew forth a large pocket-book. There was a queer look in his keen face. The truth was, he was wondering what the Earl of Dorincourt would say when he was told what was the first wish of his grandson that had been granted. He wondered what the cross, worldly, selfish old nobleman would think of it.

"I do not know that you have realized," he said, "that the Earl of Dorincourt is an exceedingly rich man. He can afford to gratify any caprice. I think it would please him to know that Lord Fauntleroy had been indulged in any fancy. If you will call him back and allow me, I shall give him five pounds for these people."

"That would be twenty-five dollars!" exclaimed Mrs. Errol. "It will seem like wealth to them. I can scarcely believe that it is true."

"It is quite true," said Mr. Havisham, with his dry smile. "A great change has taken place in your son's life, a great deal of power will lie in his hands."

"Oh!" cried his mother. "And he is such a little boy—a very little boy. How can I teach him to use it well? It makes me half afraid. My pretty little Ceddie!"

The lawyer slightly cleared his throat. It touched his worldly, hard old heart to see the tender, timid look in her brown eyes.

"I think, madam," he said, "that if I may judge from my interview with Lord Fauntleroy this morning, the next Earl of Dorincourt will think for others as well as for his noble self. He is only a child yet, but I think he may be trusted."

Then his mother went for Cedric and brought him back into the parlor. Mr. Havisham heard him talking before he entered the room.

"It's infam-natory rheumatism," he was saying, "and that's a kind of rheumatism that's dreadful. And he thinks about the rent not being paid, and Bridget says that makes the inf'ammation worse. And Pat could get a place in a store if he had some clothes."

His little face looked quite anxious when he came in. He was very sorry for Bridget.

"Dearest said you wanted me," he said to Mr. Havisham. "I've been talking to Bridget."

Mr. Havisham looked down at him a moment. He felt a little awkward and undecided. As Cedric's mother had said, he was a very little boy.

"The Earl of Dorincourt—" he began, and then he glanced involuntarily at Mrs. Errol.

Little Lord Fauntleroy's mother suddenly kneeled down by him and put both her tender arms around his childish body.

"Ceddie," she said, "the Earl is your grandpapa, your own papa's father. He is very, very kind, and he loves you and wishes you to love him, because the sons who were his little boys are dead. He wishes you to be happy and to make other people happy. He is very rich, and he wishes you to have everything you would like to have. He told Mr. Havisham so, and gave him a great deal of money for you. You can give some to Bridget now; enough to pay her rent and buy Michael everything. Isn't that fine, Ceddie? Isn't he good?" And she kissed the child on his round cheek, where the bright color suddenly flashed up in his excited amazement.

He looked from his mother to Mr. Havisham.

"Can I have it now?" he cried. "Can I give it to her this minute? She's just going."

Mr. Havisham handed him the money. It was in fresh, clean greenbacks and made a neat roll.

Ceddie flew out of the room with it.

"Bridget!" they heard him shout, as he tore into the kitchen. "Bridget, wait a minute! Here's some money. It's for you, and you can pay the rent. My grandpapa gave it to me. It's for you and Michael!"

"Oh, Master Ceddie!" cried Bridget, in an awe-stricken voice."It's twinty-foive dollars is here. Where be's the misthress?"

"I think I shall have to go and explain it to her," Mrs. Errol said.

So she, too, went out of the room and Mr. Havisham was left alone for a while. He went to the window and stood looking out into the street reflectively. He was thinking of the old Earl of Dorincourt, sitting in his great, splendid, gloomy library at the castle, gouty and lonely, surrounded by grandeur and luxury, but not really loved by any one, because in all his long life he had never really loved any one but himself; he had been selfish and self-indulgent and arrogant and passionate; he had cared so much for the Earl of Dorincourt and his pleasures that there had been no time for him to think of other people; all his wealth and power, all the benefits from his noble name and high rank, had seemed to him to be things only to be used to amuse and give pleasure to the Earl of Dorincourt; and now that he was an old man, all this excitement and selfindulgence had only brought him ill health and irritability and a dislike of the world, which certainly disliked him. In spite of all his splendor, there was never a more unpopular old nobleman than the Earl of Dorincourt, and there could scarcely have been a more lonely one. He could fill his castle with guests if he chose. He could give great dinners and splendid hunting parties; but he knew that in secret the people who would accept his invitations were afraid of his frowning old face and sarcastic, biting speeches. He had a cruel tongue and a bitter nature, and he took pleasure in sneering at people and making them feel uncomfortable, when he had the power to do so, because they were sensitive or proud or timid.

Mr. Havisham knew his hard, fierce ways by heart, and he was thinking of him as he looked out of the window into the narrow, quiet street. And there rose in his mind, in sharp contrast, the picture of the cheery, handsome little fellow sitting in the big chair and telling his story of his friends, Dick and the apple-woman, in his generous, innocent, honest way. And he thought of the immense income, the beautiful, majestic estates, the wealth, and power for good or evil, which in the course of time would lie in the small, chubby hands little Lord Fauntleroy thrust so deep into his pockets.

"It will make a great difference," he said to himself. "It will make a great difference."

Cedric and his mother came back soon after. Cedric was in high spirits. He sat down in his own chair, between his mother and the lawyer, and fell into one of his quaint attitudes, with his hands on his knees. He was glowing with enjoyment of Bridget's relief and rapture.

"She cried!" he said. "She said she was crying for joy! I never saw any one cry for joy before. My grandpapa must be a very good man. I didn't know he was so good a man. It's more—more agreeabler to be an earl than I thought it was. I'm almost glad—I'm almost QUITE glad I'm going to be one."





Chapter 3　Leaving Home


Cedric's good opinion of the advantages of being an earl increased greatly during the next week. It seemed almost impossible for him to realize that there was scarcely anything he might wish to do which he could not do easily; in fact, I think it may be said that he did not fully realize it at all. But at least he understand, after a few conversations with Mr. Havisham, that he could gratify all his nearest wishes, and he proceeded to gratify them with a simplicity and delight which caused Mr. Havisham much diversion. In the week before they sailed for England he did many curious things. The lawyer long after remembered the morning they went down-town together to pay a visit to Dick, and the afternoon they so amazed the apple-woman of ancient lineage by stopping before her stall and telling her she was to have a tent, and a stove, and a shawl, and a sum of money which seemed to her quite wonderful.

"For I have to go to England and be a lord," explained Cedric, sweettemperedly. "And I shouldn't like to have your bones on my mind every time it rained. My own bones never hurt, so I think I don't know how painful a person's bones can be, but I've sympathized with you a great deal, and I hope you'll be better."

"She's a very good apple-woman," he said to Mr. Havisham, as they walked away, leaving the proprietress of the stall almost gasping for breath, and not at all believing in her great fortune. "Once, when I fell down and cut my knee, she gave me an apple for nothing. I've always remembered her for it. You know you always remember people who are kind to you."

It had never occurred to his honest, simple little mind that there were people who could forget kindnesses.

The interview with Dick was quite exciting. Dick had just been having a great deal of trouble with Jake, and was in low spirits when they saw him. His amazement when Cedric calmly announced that they had come to give him what seemed a very great thing to him, and would set all his troubles right, almost struck him dumb. Lord Fauntleroy's manner of announcing the object of his visit was very simple and unceremonious. Mr. Havisham was much impressed by its directness as he stood by and listened. The statement that his old friend had become a lord, and was in danger of being an earl if he lived long enough, caused Dick to so open his eyes and mouth, and start, that his cap fell off. When he picked it up, he uttered a rather singular exclamation. Mr. Havisham thought it singular, but Cedric had heard it before.

"I soy!" he said, "What're yer givin' us?" This plainly embarrassed his lordship a little, but he bore himself bravely.

"Everybody thinks it not true at first," he said. "Mr. Hobbs thought I'd had a sunstroke. I didn't think I was going to like it myself, but I like it better now I'm used to it. The one who is the Earl now, he's my grandpapa; and he wants me to do anything I like. He's very kind, if he IS an earl; and he sent me a lot of money by Mr. Havisham, and I've brought some to you to buy Jake out."

And the end of the matter was that Dick actually bought Jake out, and found himself the possessor of the business and some new brushes and a most astonishing sign and outfit. He could not believe in his good luck any more easily than the apple-woman of ancient lineage could believe in hers; he walked about like a boot-black in a dream; he stared at his young benefactor and felt as if he might wake up at any moment. He scarcely seemed to realize anything until Cedric put out his hand to shake hands with him before going away.

"Well, good-bye," he said; and though he tried to speak steadily, there was a little tremble in his voice and he winked his big brown eyes. "And I hope trade'll be good. I'm sorry I'm going away to leave you, but perhaps I shall come back again when I'm an earl. And I wish you'd write to me, because we were always good friends. And if you write to me, here's where you must send your letter." And he gave him a slip of paper. "And my name isn't Cedric Errol any more; it's Lord Fauntleroy and—and good-bye, Dick."

Dick winked his eyes also, and yet they looked rather moist about the lashes. He was not an educated boot-black, and he would have found it difficult to tell what he felt just then if he had tried; perhaps that was why he didn't try, and only winked his eyes and swallowed a lump in his throat.

"I wish ye wasn't goin' away," he said in a husky voice. Then he winked his eyes again. Then he looked at Mr. Havisham, and touched his cap. "Thanky, sir, fur bringin' him down here an' fur wot ye've done, He's—he's a queer little feller," he added. "I've allers thort a heap of him. He's such a game little feller, an'—an' such a queer little un."

And when they turned away he stood and looked after them in a dazed kind of way, and there was still a mist in his eyes, and a lump in his throat, as he watched the gallant little figure marching gayly along by the side of its tall, rigid escort.

Until the day of his departure, his lordship spent as much time as possible with Mr. Hobbs in the store. Gloom had settled upon Mr. Hobbs; he was much depressed in spirits. When his young friend brought to him in triumph the parting gift of a gold watch and chain, Mr. Hobbs found it difficult to acknowledge it properly. He laid the case on his stout knee, and blew his nose violently several times.

"There's something written on it," said Cedric,—"inside the case. I told the man myself what to say. 'From his oldest friend, Lord Fauntleroy, to Mr. Hobbs. When this you see, remember me.' I don't want you to forget me."

Mr. Hobbs blew his nose very loudly again.

"I sha'n't forget you," he said, speaking a trifle huskily, as Dick had spoken; "nor don't you go and forget me when you get among the British arrystocracy."

"I shouldn't forget you, whoever I was among," answered his lordship. "I've spent my happiest hours with you; at least, some of my happiest hours. I hope you'll come to see me sometime. I'm sure my grandpapa would be very much pleased. Perhaps he'll write and ask you, when I tell him about you. You—you wouldn't mind his being an earl, would you, I mean you wouldn't stay away just because he was one, if he invited you to come?"

"I'd come to see you," replied Mr. Hobbs, graciously.

So it seemed to be agreed that if he received a pressing invitation from the Earl to come and spend a few months at Dorincourt Castle, he was to lay aside his republican prejudices and pack his valise at once.

At last all the preparations were complete; the day came when the trunks were taken to the steamer, and the hour arrived when the carriage stood at the door. Then a curious feeling of loneliness came upon the little boy. His mamma had been shut up in her room for some time; when she came down the stairs, her eyes looked large and wet, and her sweet mouth was trembling. Cedric went to her, and she bent down to him, and he put his arms around her, and they kissed each other. He knew something made them both sorry, though he scarcely knew what it was; but one tender little thought rose to his lips.

"We liked this little house, Dearest, didn't we?" he said. "We always will like it, won't we?"

"Yes—yes," she answered, in a low, sweet voice. "Yes, darling."

And then they went into the carriage and Cedric sat very close to her, and as she looked back out of the window, he looked at her and stroked her hand and held it close.

And then, it seemed almost directly, they were on the steamer in the midst of the wildest bustle and confusion; carriages were driving down and leaving passengers; passengers were getting into a state of excitement about baggage which had not arrived and threatened to be too late; big trunks and cases were being bumped down and dragged about; sailors were uncoiling ropes and hurrying to and fro; officers were giving orders; ladies and gentlemen and children and nurses were coming on board,—some were laughing and looked gay, some were silent and sad, here and there two or three were crying and touching their eyes with their handkerchiefs. Cedric found something to interest him on every side; he looked at the piles of rope, at the furled sails, at the tall, tall masts which seemed almost to touch the hot blue sky; he began to make plans for conversing with the sailors and gaining some information on the subject of pirates.

It was just at the very last, when he was standing leaning on the railing of the upper deck and watching the final preparations, enjoying the excitement and the shouts of the sailors and wharfmen, that his attention was called to a slight bustle in one of the groups not far from him. Some one was hurriedly forcing his way through this group and coming toward him. It was a boy, with something red in his hand. It was Dick. He came up to Cedric quite breathless.

"I've run all the way," he said. "I've come down to see ye off. Trade's been prime! I bought this for ye out o' what I made yesterday. Ye kin wear it when ye get among the swells. I lost the paper when I was tryin' to get through them fellers downstairs. They didn't want to let me up. It's a hankercher."

He poured it all forth as if in one sentence. A bell rang, and he made a leap away before Cedric had time to speak.

"Good-bye!" he panted. "Wear it when ye get among the swells." And he darted off and was gone.

A few seconds later they saw him struggle through the crowd on the lower deck, and rush on shore just before the gang-plank was drawn in. He stood on the wharf and waved his cap.

Cedric held the handkerchief in his hand. It was of bright red silk ornamented with purple horseshoes and horses' heads. There was a great straining and creaking and confusion.

The people on the wharf began to shout to their friends, and the people on the steamer shouted back:

"Good-bye! Good-bye! Good-bye, old fellow!" Every one seemed to be saying, "Don't forget us. Write when you get to Liverpool. Good-bye! Good-bye!"

Little Lord Fauntleroy leaned forward and waved the red handkerchief.

"Good-bye, Dick!" he shouted, lustily. "Thank you! Good-bye, Dick!"

And the big steamer moved away, and the people cheered again, and Cedric's mother drew the veil over her eyes, and on the shore there was left great confusion; but Dick saw nothing save that bright, childish face and the bright hair that the sun shone on and the breeze lifted, and he heard nothing but the hearty childish voice calling "Good-bye, Dick!" as little Lord Fauntleroy steamed slowly away from the home of his birth to the unknown land of his ancestors.





Chapter 4　In England


It was during the voyage that Cedric's mother told him that his home was not to be hers; and when he first understood it, his grief was so great that Mr. Havisham saw that the Earl had been wise in making the arrangements that his mother should be quite near him, and see him often; for it was very plain he could not have borne the separation otherwise. But his mother managed the little fellow so sweetly and lovingly, and made him feel that she would be so near him, that, after a while, he ceased to be oppressed by the fear of any real parting.

"My house is not far from the Castle, Ceddie," she repeated each time the subject was referred to—"a very little way from yours, and you can always run in and see me every day, and you will have so many things to tell me! and we shall be so happy together! It is a beautiful place. Your papa has often told me about it. He loved it very much; and you will love it too."

"I should love it better if you were there," his small lordship said, with a heavy little sigh.

He could not but feel puzzled by so strange a state of affairs, which could put his"Dearest" in one house and himself in another.

The fact was that Mrs. Errol had thought it better not to tell him why this plan had been made.

"I should prefer he should not be told," she said to Mr. Havisham. "He would not really understand; he would only be shocked and hurt; and I feel sure that his feeling for the Earl will be a more natural and affectionate one if he does not know that his grandfather dislikes me so bitterly. He has never seen hatred or hardness, and it would be a great blow to him to find out that any one could hate me. He is so loving himself, and I am so dear to him! It is better for him that he should not be told until he is much older, and it is far better for the Earl. It would make a barrier between them, even though Ceddie is such a child."

So Cedric only knew that there was some mysterious reason for the arrangement, some reason which he was not old enough to understand, but which would be explained when he was older. He was puzzled; but, after all, it was not the reason he cared about so much; and after many talks with his mother, in which she comforted him and placed before him the bright side of the picture, the dark side of it gradually began to fade out, though now and then Mr. Havisham saw him sitting in some queer little old-fashioned attitude, watching the sea, with a very grave face, and more than once he heard an unchildish sigh rise to his lips.

"I don't like it," he said once as he was having one of his almost venerable talks with the lawyer. "You don't know how much I don't like it; but there are a great many troubles in this world, and you have to bear them. Mary says so, and I've heard Mr. Hobbs say it too. And Dearest wants me to like to live with my grandpapa, because, you see, all his children are dead, and that's very mournful. It makes you sorry for a man, when all his children have died—and one was killed suddenly.

One of the things which always delighted the people who made the acquaintance of his young lordship was the sage little air he wore at times when he gave himself up to conversation;—combined with his occasionally elderly remarks and the extreme innocence and seriousness of his round childish face, it was irresistible. He was such a handsome, blooming, curly-headed little fellow, that, when he sat down and nursed his knee with his chubby hands, and conversed with much gravity, he was a source of great entertainment to his hearers. Gradually Mr. Havisham had begun to derive a great deal of private pleasure and amusement from his society.

"And so you are going to try to like the Earl," he said.

"Yes," answered his lordship. "He's my relation, and of course you have to like your relations; and besides, he's been very kind to me. When a person does so many things for you, and wants you to have everything you wish for, of course you'd like him if he wasn't your relation; but when he's your relation and does that, why, you're very fond of him."

"Do you think," suggested Mr. Havisham, "that he will be fond of you?"

"Well," said Cedric, "I think he will, because, you see, I'm his relation, too, and I'm his boy's little boy besides, and, well, don't you see—of course he must be fond of me now, or he wouldn't want me to have everything that I like, and he wouldn't have sent you for me."

"Oh!" remarked the lawyer, "that's it, is it?"

"Yes," said Cedric, "that's it. Don't you think that's it too? Of course a man would be fond of his grandson."

The people who had been seasick had no sooner recovered from their seasickness, and come on deck to recline in their steamer-chairs and enjoy themselves, than every one seemed to know the romantic story of little Lord Fauntleroy, and every one took an interest in the little fellow, who ran about the ship or walked with his mother or the tall, thin old lawyer, or talked to the sailors. Every one liked him; he made friends everywhere. He was ever ready to make friends. When the gentlemen walked up and down the deck, and let him walk with them, he stepped out with a manly, sturdy little tramp, and answered all their jokes with much gay enjoyment; when the ladies talked to him, there was always laughter in the group of which he was the center; when he played with the children, there was always magnificent fun on hand. Among the sailors he had the heartiest friends; he heard miraculous stories about pirates and shipwrecks and desert islands; he learned to splice ropes and rig toy ships, and gained an amount of information concerning "top'ls" and "mains'ls," quite surprising. His conversation had, indeed, quite a nautical flavor at times, and on one occasion he raised a shout of laughter in a group of ladies and gentlemen who were sitting on deck, wrapped in shawls and overcoats, by saying sweetly, and with a very engaging expression:

"Shiver my timbers, but it's a cold day!"

It surprised him when they laughed. He had picked up this sea-faring remark from an "elderly naval man" of the name of Jerry, who told him stories in which it occurred frequently. To judge from his stories of his own adventures, Jerry had made some two or three thousand voyages, and had been invariably shipwrecked on each occasion on an island densely populated with bloodthirsty cannibals. Judging, also, by these same exciting adventures, he had been partially roasted and eaten frequently and had been scalped some fifteen or twenty times.

"That is why he is so bald," explained Lord Fauntleroy to his mamma. "After you have been scalped several times the hair never grows again. Jerry's never grew again after that last time, when the King of the Parromachaweekins did it with the knife made out of the skull of the Chief of the Wopslemumpkies. He says it was one of the most serious times he ever had. He was so frightened that his hair stood right straight up when the king flourished his knife, and it never would lie down, and the king wears it that way now, and it looks something like a hair-brush. I never heard anything like the asperiences Jerry has had! I should so like to tell Mr. Hobbs about them!"

Sometimes, when the weather was very disagreeable and people were kept below decks in the saloon, a party of his grown-up friends would persuade him to tell them some of these "asperiences" of Jerry's, and as he sat relating them with great delight and fervor, there was certainly no more popular voyager on any ocean steamer crossing the Atlantic than little Lord Fauntleroy. He was always innocently and good-naturedly ready to do his small best to add to the general entertainment, and there was a charm in the very unconsciousness of his own childish importance.

"Jerry's stories int'rust them very much," he said to his mamma. "For my part—you must excuse me, Dearest—but sometimes I should have thought they couldn't be all quite true, if they hadn't happened to Jerry himself; but as they all happened to Jerry—well, it's very strange, you know, and perhaps sometimes he may forget and be a little mistaken, as he's been scalped so often. Being scalped a great many times might make a person forgetful."

It was eleven days after he had said good-bye to his friend Dick before he reached Liverpool; and it was on the night of the twelfth day that the carriage in which he and his mother and Mr. Havisham had driven from the station stopped before the gates of Court Lodge. They could not see much of the house in the darkness. Cedric only saw that there was a driveway under great arching trees, and after the carriage had rolled down this drive-way a short distance, he saw an open door and a stream of bright light coming through it.

Mary had come with them to attend her mistress, and she had reached the house before them. When Cedric jumped out of the carriage he saw one or two servants standing in the wide, bright hall, and Mary stood in the door-way.

Lord Fauntleroy sprang at her with a gay little shout.

"Did you get here, Mary?" he said. "Here's Mary, Dearest," and he kissed the maid on her rough red cheek.

"I am glad you are here, Mary," Mrs. Errol said to her in a low voice. "It is such a comfort to me to see you. It takes the strangeness away." And she held out her little hand, which Mary squeezed encouragingly. She knew how this first "strangeness" must feel to this little mother who had left her own land and was about to give up her child.

The English servants looked with curiosity at both the boy and his mother. They had heard all sorts of rumors about them both; they knew how angry the old Earl had been, and why Mrs. Errol was to live at the lodge and her little boy at the castle; they knew all about the great fortune he was to inherit, and about the savage old grandfather and his gout and his tempers.

"He'll have no easy time of it, poor little chap," they had said among themselves.

But they did not know what sort of a little lord had come among them; they did not quite understand the character of the next Earl of Dorincourt.

He pulled off his overcoat quite as if he were used to doing things for himself, and began to look about him. He looked about the broad hall, at the pictures and stags' antlers and curious things that ornamented it. They seemed curious to him because he had never seen such things before in a private house.

"Dearest," he said, "this is a very pretty house, isn't it? I am glad you are going to live here. It's quite a large house."

It was quite a large house compared to the one in the shabby New York street, and it was very pretty and cheerful. Mary led them upstairs to a bright chintz-hung bedroom where a fire was burning, and a large snowwhite Persian cat was sleeping luxuriously on the white fur hearth-rug.

"It was the house-kaper up at the Castle, ma'am, sint her to yez," explained Mary. "It's herself is a kind-hearted lady an' has had iverything done to prepar' fur yez. I seen her meself a few minnits, an' she was fond av the Capt'in, ma'am, an', graivs fur him; and she said to say the big cat slapin' on the rug moight make the room same homeloike to yez. She knowed Capt'in Errol whin he was a bye—an' a foine handsum' bye she ses he was, an' a foine young man wid a plisint word fur every one, great an'shmall. An' ses I to her, ses I: 'He's lift a bye that's loike him, ma'am, fur a foiner little felly niversthipped in shoe-leather.'"

When they were ready, they went downstairs into another big bright room; its ceiling was low, and the furniture was heavy and beautifully carved, the chairs were deep and had high massive backs, and there were queer shelves and cabinets with strange, pretty ornaments on them. There was a great tiger-skin before the fire, and an arm-chair on each side of it. The stately white cat had responded to Lord Fauntleroy's stroking and followed him downstairs, and when he threw himself down upon the rug, she curled herself up grandly beside him as if she intended to make friends. Cedric was so pleased that he put his head down by hers, and lay stroking her, not noticing what his mother and Mr. Havisham were saying.

They were, indeed, speaking in a rather low tone. Mrs. Errol looked a little pale and agitated.

"He need not go to-night?" she said. "He will stay with me to-night?"

"Yes," answered Mr. Havisham in the same low tone; "it will not be necessary for him to go to-night. I myself will go to the Castle as soon as we have dined, and inform the Earl of our arrival."

Mrs. Errol glanced down at Cedric. He was lying in a graceful, careless attitude upon the black-and-yellow skin; the fire shone on his handsome, flushed little face, and on the tumbled, curly hair spread out on the rug; the big cat was purring in drowsy content,—she liked the caressing touch of the kind little hand on her fur.

Mrs. Errol smiled faintly.

"His lordship does not know all that he is taking from me," she said rather sadly. Then she looked at the lawyer. "Will you tell him, if you please," she said, "that I should rather not have the money?"

"The money!" Mr. Havisham exclaimed. "You can not mean the income he proposed to settle upon you!"

"Yes," she answered, quite simply; "I think I should rather not have it. I am obliged to accept the house, and I thank him for it, because it makes it possible for me to be near my child; but I have a little money of my own,—enough to live simply upon,—and I should rather not take the other. As he dislikes me so much, I should feel a little as if I were selling Cedric to him. I am giving him up only because I love him enough to forget myself for his good, and because his father would wish it to be so."

Mr. Havisham rubbed his chin.

"This is very strange," he said. "He will be very angry. He won't understand it."

"I think he will understand it after he thinks it over," she said. "I do not really need the money, and why should I accept luxuries from the man who hates me so much that he takes my little boy from me—his son's child?"

Mr. Havisham looked reflective for a few moments.

"I will deliver your message," he said afterward.

And then the dinner was brought in and they sat down together, the big cat taking a seat on a chair near Cedric's and purring majestically throughout the meal.

When, later in the evening, Mr. Havisham presented himself at the Castle, he was taken at once to the Earl. He found him sitting by the fire in a luxurious easy-chair, his foot on a gout-stool. He looked at the lawyer sharply from under his shaggy eyebrows, but Mr. Havisham could see that, in spite of his pretense at calmness, he was nervous and secretly excited.

"Well," he said; "well, Havisham, come back, have you? What's the news?"

"Lord Fauntleroy and his mother are at Court Lodge," replied Mr. Havisham. "They bore the voyage very well and are in excellent health."

The Earl made a half-impatient sound and moved his hand restlessly.

"Glad to hear it," he said brusquely. "So far, so good. Make yourself comfortable. Have a glass of wine and settle down. What else?"

"His lordship remains with his mother to-night. To-morrow I will bring him to the Castle."

The Earl's elbow was resting on the arm of his chair; he put his hand up and shielded his eyes with it.

"Well," he said; "go on. You know I told you not to write to me about the matter, and I know nothing whatever about it. What kind of a lad is he? I don't care about the mother; what sort of a lad is he?"

Mr. Havisham drank a little of the glass of port he had poured out for himself, and sat holding it in his hand.

"It is rather difficult to judge of the character of a child of seven," he said cautiously.

The Earl's prejudices were very intense. He looked up quickly and uttered a rough word.

"A fool, is he?" he exclaimed. "Or a clumsy cub? His American blood tells, does it?"

"I do not think it has injured him, my lord," replied the lawyer in his dry, deliberate fashion. "I don't know much about children, but I thought him rather a fine lad."

His manner of speech was always deliberate and unenthusiastic, but he made it a trifle more so than usual. He had a shrewd fancy that it would be better that the Earl should judge for himself, and be quite unprepared for his first interview with his grandson.

"Healthy and well-grown?" asked my lord.

"Apparently very healthy, and quite well-grown," replied the lawyer.

"Straight-limbed and well enough to look at?" demanded the Earl.

A very slight smile touched Mr. Havisham's thin lips. There rose up before his mind's eye the picture he had left at Court Lodge,—the beautiful, graceful child's body lying upon the tiger-skin in careless comfort—the bright, tumbled hair spread on the rug—the bright, rosy boy's face.

"Rather a handsome boy, I think, my lord, as boys go," he said,"though I am scarcely a judge, perhaps. But you will find him somewhat different from most English children, I dare say."

"I haven't a doubt of that," snarled the Earl, a twinge of gout seizing him. "A lot of impudent little beggars, those American children; I've heard that often enough."

"It is not exactly impudence in his case," said Mr. Havisham. "I can scarcely describe what the difference is. He has lived more with older people than with children, and the difference seems to be a mixture of maturity and childishness."

"American impudence!" protested the Earl. "I've heard of it before. They call it precocity and freedom. Beastly, impudent bad manners; that's what it is!"

Mr. Havisham drank some more port. He seldom argued with his lordly patron, —never when his lordly patron's noble leg was inflamed by gout. At such times it was always better to leave him alone. So there was a silence of a few moments. It was Mr. Havisham who broke it.

"I have a message to deliver from Mrs. Errol," he remarked.

"I don't want any of her messages!" growled his lordship; "the less I hear of her the better."

"This is a rather important one," explained the lawyer. "She prefers not to accept the income you proposed to settle on her."

The Earl started visibly.

"What's that?" he cried out. "What's that?"

Mr. Havisham repeated his words.

"She says it is not necessary, and that as the relations between you are not friendly—"

"Not friendly!" ejaculated my lord savagely; "I should say they were not friendly! I hate to think of her! A mercenary, sharp-voiced American! I don't wish to see her."

"My lord," said Mr. Havisham, "you can scarcely call her mercenary. She has asked for nothing. She does not accept the money you offer her."

"All done for effect!" snapped his noble lordship. "She wants to wheedle me into seeing her. She thinks I shall admire her spirit. I don't admire it! It's only American independence! I won't have her living like a beggar at my park gates. As she's the boy's mother, she has a position to keep up, and she shall keep it up. She shall have the money, whether she likes it or not!"

"She won't spend it," said Mr. Havisham.

"I don't care whether she spends it or not!" blustered my lord. "She shall have it sent to her. She sha'n't tell people that she has to live like a pauper because I have done nothing for her! She wants to give the boy a bad opinion of me! I suppose she has poisoned his mind against me already!"

"No," said Mr. Havisham. "I have another message, which will prove to you that she has not done that."

"I don't want to hear it!" panted the Earl, out of breath with anger and excitement and gout.

But Mr. Havisham delivered it.

"She asks you not to let Lord Fauntleroy hear anything which would lead him to understand that you separate him from her because of your prejudice against her. He is very fond of her, and she is convinced that it would cause a barrier to exist between you. She says he would not comprehend it, and it might make him fear you in some measure, or at least cause him to feel less affection for you. She has told him that he is too young to understand the reason, but shall hear it when he is older. She wishes that there should be no shadow on your first meeting."

The Earl sank back into his chair. His deep-set fierce old eyes gleamed under his beetling brows.

"Come, now!" he said, still breathlessly. "Come, now! You don't mean the mother hasn't told him?"

"Not one word, my lord," replied the lawyer coolly. "That I can assure you. The child is prepared to believe you the most amiable and affectionate of grandparents. Nothing—absolutely nothing has been said to him to give him the slightest doubt of your perfection. And as I carried out your commands in every detail, while in New York, he certainly regards you as a wonder of generosity."

"He does, eh?" said the Earl.

"I give you my word of honor," said Mr. Havisham, "that Lord Fauntleroy's impressions of you will depend entirely upon yourself. And if you will pardon the liberty I take in making the suggestion, I think you will succeed better with him if you take the precaution not to speak slightingly of his mother."

"Pooh, pooh!" said the Earl. "The youngster is only seven years old!"

"He has spent those seven years at his mother's side," returned Mr. Havisham; "and she has all his affection."





Chapter 5　At the Castle


It was late in the afternoon when the carriage containing little Lord Fauntleroy and Mr. Havisham drove up the long avenue which led to the castle. The Earl had given orders that his grandson should arrive in time to dine with him; and for some reason best known to himself, he had also ordered that the child should be sent alone into the room in which he intended to receive him. As the carriage rolled up the avenue, Lord Fauntleroy sat leaning comfortably against the luxurious cushions, and regarded the prospect with great interest. He was, in fact, interested in everything he saw. He had been interested in the carriage, with its large, splendid horses and their glittering harness; he had been interested in the tall coachman and footman, with their resplendent livery; and he had been especially interested in the coronet on the panels, and had struck up an acquaintance with the footman for the purpose of the inquiring what it meant.

When the carriage reached the great gates of the park, he looked out of the window to get a good view of the huge stone lions ornamenting the entrance. The gates were opened by a motherly, rosy-looking woman, who came out of a pretty, ivy-covered lodge. Two children ran out of the door of the house and stood looking with round, wide-open eyes at the little boy in the carriage, who looked at them also. Their mother stood courtesying and smiling, and the children, on receiving a sign from her, made bobbing little courtesies too.

"Does she know me?" asked Lord Fauntleroy. "I think she must think she knows me." And he took off his black velvet cap to her and smiled.

"How do you do?" he said brightly. "Good-afternoon!"

The woman seemed pleased, he thought. The smile broadened on her rosy face and a kind look came into her blue eyes.

"God bless your lordship!" she said. "God bless your pretty face! Good luck and happiness to your lordship! Welcome to you!"

Lord Fauntleroy waved his cap and nodded to her again as the carriage rolled by her.

"I like that woman," he said. "She looks as if she liked boys. I should like to come here and play with her children. I wonder if she has enough to make up a company?"

Mr. Havisham did not tell him that he would scarcely be allowed to make playmates of the gate-keeper's children. The lawyer thought there was time enough for giving him that information.

The carriage rolled on and on between the great, beautiful trees which grew on each side of the avenue and stretched their broad, swaying branches in an arch across it. Cedric had never seen such trees,—they were so grand and stately, and their branches grew so low down on their huge trunks. He did not then know that Dorincourt Castle was one of the most beautiful in all England; that its park was one of the broadest and finest, and its trees and avenue almost without rivals. But he did know that it was all very beautiful. He liked the big, broad-branched trees, with the late afternoon sunlight striking golden lances through them. He liked the perfect stillness which rested on everything. He felt a great, strange pleasure in the beauty of which he caught glimpses under and between the sweeping boughs—the great, beautiful spaces of the park, with still other trees standing sometimes stately and alone, and sometimes in groups. Now and then they passed places where tall ferns grew in masses, and again and again the ground was azure with the bluebells swaying in the soft breeze. Several times he started up with a laugh of delight as a rabbit leaped up from under the greenery and scudded away with a twinkle of short white tail behind it. Once a covey of partridges rose with a sudden whir and flew away, and then he shouted and clapped his hands.

"It's a beautiful place, isn't it?" he said to Mr. Havisham. "I never saw such a beautiful place. It's prettier even than Central Park."

He was rather puzzled by the length of time they were on their way.

"How far is it," he said, at length, "from the gate to the front door?"

"It is between three and four miles," answered the lawyer.

"That's a long way for a person to live from his gate," remarked his lordship.

Every few minutes he saw something new to wonder at and admire. When he caught sight of the deer, some couched in the grass, some standing with their pretty antlered heads turned with a half-startled air toward the avenue as the carriage wheels disturbed them, he was enchanted.

"Has there been a circus?" he cried; "or do they live here always? Whose are they?"

"They live here," Mr. Havisham told him. "They belong to the Earl, your grandfather."

It was not long after this that they saw the castle. It rose up before them stately and beautiful and gray, the last rays of the sun casting dazzling lights on its many windows. It had turrets and battlements and towers; a great deal of ivy grew upon its walls; all the broad, open space about it was laid out in terraces and lawns and beds of brilliant flowers.

"It's the most beautiful place I ever saw!" said Cedric, his round face flushing with pleasure. "It reminds any one of a king's palace. I saw a picture of one once in a fairy-book."

He saw the great entrance-door thrown open and many servants standing in two lines looking at him. He wondered why they were standing there, and admired their liveries very much. He did not know that they were there to do honor to the little boy to whom all this splendor would one day belong,—the beautiful castle like the fairy king's palace, the magnificent park, the grand old trees, the dells full of ferns and bluebells where the hares and rabbits played, the dappled, large-eyed deer couching in the deep grass. It was only a couple of weeks since he had sat with Mr. Hobbs among the potatoes and canned peaches, with his legs dangling from the high stool; it would not have been possible for him to realize that he had very much to do with all this grandeur. At the head of the line of servants there stood an elderly woman in a rich, plain black silk gown; she had gray hair and wore a cap. As he entered the hall she stood nearer than the rest, and the child thought from the look in her eyes that she was going to speak to him. Mr. Havisham, who held his hand, paused a moment.

"This is Lord Fauntleroy, Mrs. Mellon," he said. "Lord Fauntleroy, this is Mrs. Mellon, who is the housekeeper."

Cedric gave her his hand, his eyes lighting up.

"Was it you who sent the cat?" he said. "I'm much obliged to you, ma'am."

Mrs. Mellon's handsome old face looked as pleased as the face of the lodge-keeper's wife had done.

"I should know his lordship anywhere," she said to Mr. Havisham. "He has the Captain's face and way. It's a great day, this, sir."

Cedric wondered why it was a great day. He looked at Mrs. Mellon curiously. It seemed to him for a moment as if there were tears in her eyes, and yet it was evident she was not unhappy. She smiled down on him.

"The cat left two beautiful kittens here," she said; "they shall be sent up to your lordship's nursery."

Mr. Havisham said a few words to her in a low voice.

"In the library, sir," Mrs. Mellon replied. "His lordship is to be taken there alone."

A few minutes later, the very tall footman in livery, who had escorted Cedric to the library door, opened it and announced: "Lord Fauntleroy, my lord," in quite a majestic tone. If he was only a footman, he felt it was rather a grand occasion when the heir came home to his own land and possessions, and was ushered into the presence of the old Earl, whose place and title he was to take.

Cedric crossed the threshold into the room. It was a very large and splendid room, with massive carven furniture in it, and shelves upon shelves of books; the furniture was so dark, and the draperies so heavy, the diamond-paned windows were so deep, and it seemed such a distance from one end of it to the other, that, since the sun had gone down, the effect of it all was rather gloomy. For a moment Cedric thought there was nobody in the room, but soon he saw that by the fire burning on the wide hearth there was a large easy-chair and that in that chair some one was sitting—some one who did not at first turn to look at him.

But he had attracted attention in one quarter at least. On the floor, by the arm-chair, lay a dog, a huge tawny mastiff, with body and limbs almost as big as a lion's; and this great creature rose majestically and slowly, and marched toward the little fellow with a heavy step.

Then the person in the chair spoke. "Dougal," he called, "Come back, sir."

But there was no more fear in little Lord Fauntleroy's heart than there was unkindness—he had been a brave little fellow all his life. He put his hand on the big dog's collar in the most natural way in the world, and they strayed forward together, Dougal sniffing as he went.

And then the Earl looked up. What Cedric saw was a large old man with shaggy white hair and eyebrows, and a nose like an eagle's beak between his deep, fierce eyes. What the Earl saw was a graceful, childish figure in a black velvet suit, with a lace collar, and with love-locks waving about the handsome, manly little face, whose eyes met his with a look of innocent good-fellowship. If the Castle was like the palace in a fairy story, it must be owned that little Lord Fauntleroy was himself rather like a small copy of the fairy prince, though he was not at all aware of the fact, and perhaps was rather a sturdy young model of a fairy. But there was a sudden glow of triumph and exultation in the fiery old Earl's heart as he saw what a strong, beautiful boy this grandson was, and how unhesitatingly he looked up as he stood with his hand on the big dog's neck. It pleased the grim old nobleman that the child should show no shyness or fear, either of the dog or of himself.

Cedric looked at him just as he had looked at the woman at the lodge and at the housekeeper, and came quite close to him.

"Are you the Earl?" he said. "I'm your grandson, you know, that Mr. Havisham brought. I'm Lord Fauntleroy."

He held out his hand because he thought it must be the polite and proper thing to do even with earls. "I hope you are very well," he continued, with the utmost friendliness. "I'm very glad to see you."

The Earl shook hands with him, with a curious gleam in his eyes; just at first, he was so astonished that he scarcely knew what to say. He stared at the picturesque little apparition from under his shaggy brows, and took it all in from head to foot.

"Glad to see me, are you?" he said.

"Yes," answered Lord Fauntleroy, "very."

There was a chair near him, and he sat down on it; it was a highbacked, rather tall chair, and his feet did not touch the floor when he had settled himself in it, but he seemed to be quite comfortable as he sat there, and regarded his august relative intently but modestly.

"I've kept wondering what you would look like," he remarked. "I used to lie in my berth in the ship and wonder if you would be anything like my father."

"Am I?" asked the Earl.

"Well," Cedric replied, "I was very young when he died, and I may not remember exactly how he looked, but I don't think you are like him."

"You are disappointed, I suppose?" suggested his grandfather.

"Oh, no," responded Cedric politely. "Of course you would like any one to look like your father; but of course you would enjoy the way your grandfather looked, even if he wasn't like your father. You know how it is yourself about admiring your relations."

The Earl leaned back in his chair and stared. He could not be said to know how it was about admiring his relations. He had employed most of his noble leisure in quarreling violently with them, in turning them out of his house, and applying abusive epithets to them; and they all hated him cordially.

"Any boy would love his grandfather," continued Lord Fauntleroy, "especially one that had been as kind to him as you have been."

Another queer gleam came into the old nobleman's eyes.

"Oh!" he said, "I have been kind to you, have I?"

"Yes," answered Lord Fauntleroy brightly; "I'm ever so much obliged to you about Bridget, and the apple-woman, and Dick."

"Bridget!" exclaimed the Earl."Dick! The apple-woman!"

"Yes!" explained Cedric; "the ones you gave me all that money for—the money you told Mr. Havisham to give me if I wanted it."

"Ha!" ejaculated his lordship. "That's it, is it? The money you were to spend as you liked. What did you buy with it? I should like to hear something about that."

He drew his shaggy eyebrows together and looked at the child sharply. He was secretly curious to know in what way the lad had indulged himself.

"Oh!" said Lord Fauntleroy,"perhaps you didn't know about Dick and the apple-woman and Bridget. I forgot you lived such a long way off from them. They were particular friends of mine. And you see Michael had the fever—"

"Who's Michael?" asked the Earl.

"Michael is Bridget's husband, and they were in great trouble. When a man is sick and can't work and has twelve children, you know how it is. And Michael has always been a sober man. And Bridget used to come to our house and cry. And the evening Mr. Havisham was there, she was in the kitchen crying, because they had almost nothing to eat and couldn't pay the rent; and I went in to see her, and Mr. Havisham sent for me and he said you had given him some money for me. And I ran as fast as I could into the kitchen and gave it to Bridget; and that made it all right; and Bridget could scarcely believe her eyes. That's why I'm so obliged to you."

"Oh!" said the Earl in his deep voice, "that was one of the things you did for yourself, was it? What else?"

Dougal had been sitting by the tall chair; the great dog had taken its place there when Cedric sat down. Several times it had turned and looked up at the boy as if interested in the conversation. Dougal was a solemn dog, who seemed to feel altogether too big to take life's responsibilities lightly. The old Earl, who knew the dog well, had watched it with secret interest. Dougal was not a dog whose habit it was to make acquaintances rashly, and the Earl wondered somewhat to see how quietly the brute sat under the touch of the childish hand. And, just at this moment, the big dog gave little Lord Fauntleroy one more look of dignified scrutiny, and deliberately laid its huge, lion-like head on the boy's black-velvet knee.

The small hand went on stroking this new friend as Cedric answered:

"Well, there was Dick," he said."You'd like Dick, he's so square."

This was an Americanism the Earl was not prepared for.

"What does that mean?" he inquired.

Lord Fauntleroy paused a moment to reflect. He was not very sure himself what it meant. He had taken it for granted as meaning something very creditable because Dick had been fond of using it.

"I think it means that he wouldn't cheat any one," he exclaimed; "or hit a boy who was under his size, and that he blacks people's boots very well and makes them shine as much as he can. He's a perfessional bootblack."

"And he's one of your acquaintances, is he?" said the Earl.

"He is an old friend of mine," replied his grandson. "Not quite as old as Mr. Hobbs, but quite old. He gave me a present just before the ship sailed."

He put his hand into his pocket and drew forth a neatly folded red object and opened it with an air of affectionate pride. It was the red silk handkerchief with the large purple horse-shoes and heads on it.

"He gave me this," said his young lordship. "I shall keep it always. You can wear it round your neck or keep it in your pocket. He bought it with the first money he earned after I bought Jake out and gave him the new brushes. It's a keepsake. I put some poetry in Mr. Hobbs's watch. It was, 'When this you see, remember me.' When this I see, I shall always remember Dick."

The sensations of the Right Honorable the Earl of Dorincourt could scarcely be described. He was not an old nobleman who was very easily bewildered, because he had seen a great deal of the world; but here was something he found so novel that it almost took his lordly breath away, and caused him some singular emotions. He had never cared for children; he had been so occupied with his own pleasures that he had never had time to care for them. His own sons had not interested him when they were very young—though sometimes he remembered having thought Cedric's father a handsome and strong little fellow. He had been so selfish himself that he had missed the pleasure of seeing unselfishness in others, and he had not known how tender and faithful and affectionate a kind-hearted little child can be, and how innocent and unconscious are its simple, generous impulses. A boy had always seemed to him a most objectionable little animal, selfish and greedy and boisterous when not under strict restraint; his own two eldest sons had given their tutors constant trouble and annoyance, and of the younger one he fancied he had heard few complaints because the boy was of no particular importance. It had never once occurred to him that he should like his grandson; he had sent for the little Cedric because his pride impelled him to do so. If the boy was to take his place in the future, he did not wish his name to be made ridiculous by descending to an uneducated boor. He had been convinced the boy would be a clownish fellow if he were brought up in America. He had no feeling of affection for the lad; his only hope was that he should find him decently well-featured, and with a respectable share of sense; he had been so disappointed in his other sons, and had been made so furious by Captain Errol's American marriage, that he had never once thought that anything creditable could come of it. When the footman had announced Lord Fauntleroy, he had almost dreaded to look at the boy lest he should find him all that he had feared. It was because of this feeling that he had ordered that the child should be sent to him alone. His pride could not endure that others should see his disappointment if he was to be disappointed. His proud, stubborn old heart therefore had leaped within him when the boy came forward with his graceful, easy carriage, his fearless hand on the big dog's neck. Even in the moments when he had hoped the most, the Earl had never hoped that his grandson would look like that. It seemed almost too good to be true that this should be the boy he had dreaded to see—the child of the woman he so disliked—this little fellow with so much beauty and such a brave, childish grace! The Earl's stern composure was quite shaken by this startling surprise.

And then their talk began; and he was still more curiously moved, and more and more puzzled. In the first place, he was so used to seeing people rather afraid and embarrassed before him, that he had expected nothing else but that his grandson would be timid or shy. But Cedric was no more afraid of the Earl than he had been of Dougal. He was not bold; he was only innocently friendly, and he was not conscious that there could be any reason why he should be awkward or afraid. The Earl could not help seeing that the little boy took him for a friend and treated him as one, without having any doubt of him at all. It was quite plain as the little fellow sat there in his tall chair and talked in his friendly way that it had never occurred to him that this large, fierce-looking old man could be anything but kind to him, and rather pleased to see him there. And it was plain, too, that, in his childish way, he wished to please and interest his grandfather. Cross, and hard-hearted, and worldly as the old Earl was, he could not help feeling a secret and novel pleasure in this very confidence. After all, it was not disagreeable to meet some one who did not distrust him or shrink from him, or seem to detect the ugly part of his nature; some one who looked at him with clear, unsuspecting eyes, —if it was only a little boy in a black velvet suit.

So the old man leaned back in his chair, and led his young companion on to telling him still more of himself, and with that odd gleam in his eyes watched the little fellow as he talked. Lord Fauntleroy was quite willing to answer all his questions and chatted on in his genial little way quite composedly. He told him all about Dick and Jake, and the apple-woman, and Mr. Hobbs; he described the Republican Rally in all the glory of its banners and transparencies, torches and rockets. In the course of the conversation, he reached the Fourth of July and the Revolution, and was just becoming enthusiastic, when he suddenly recollected something and stopped very abruptly.

"What is the matter?" demanded his grandfather. "Why don't you go on?"

Lord Fauntleroy moved rather uneasily in his chair. It was evident to the Earl that he was embarrassed by the thought which had just occurred to him.

"I was just thinking that perhaps you mightn't like it," he replied."Perhaps some one belonging to you might have been there. I forgot you were an Englishman."

"You can go on," said my lord. "No one belonging to me was there. You forgot you were an Englishman, too."

"Oh! no," said Cedric quickly. "I'm an American!"

"You are an Englishman," said the Earl grimly. "Your father was an Englishman."

It amused him a little to say this, but it did not amuse Cedric. The lad had never thought of such a development as this. He felt himself grow quite hot up to the roots of his hair.

"I was born in America," he protested. "You have to be an American if you are born in America. I beg your pardon," with serious politeness and delicacy, "for contradicting you. Mr. Hobbs told me, if there were another war, you know, I should have to—to be an American."

The Earl gave a grim half laugh—it was short and grim, but it was a laugh.

"You would, would you?" he said.

He hated America and Americans, but it amused him to see how serious and interested this small patriot was. He thought that so good an American might make a rather good Englishman when he was a man.

They had not time to go very deep into the Revolution again—and indeed Lord Fauntleroy felt some delicacy about returning to the subject—before dinner was announced.

Cedric left his chair and went to his noble kinsman. He looked down at his gouty foot.

"Would you like me to help you?" he said politely. "You could lean on me, you know. Once when Mr. Hobbs hurt his foot with a potato-barrel rolling on it, he used to lean on me."

The big footman almost periled his reputation and his situation by smiling. He was an aristocratic footman who had always lived in the best of noble families, and he had never smiled; indeed, he would have felt himself a disgraced and vulgar footman if he had allowed himself to be led by any circumstance whatever into such an indiscretion as a smile. But he had a very narrow escape. He only just saved himself by staring straight over the Earl's head at a very ugly picture.

The Earl looked his valiant young relative over from head to foot.

"Do you think you could do it?" he asked gruffly.

"I THINK I could," said Cedric. "I'm strong. I'm seven, you know. You could lean on your stick on one side, and on me on the other. Dick says I've a good deal of muscle for a boy that's only seven."

He shut his hand and moved it upward to his shoulder, so that the Earl might see the muscle Dick had kindly approved of, and his face was so grave and earnest that the footman found it necessary to look very hard indeed at the ugly picture.

"Well," said the Earl, "you may try."

Cedric gave him his stick and began to assist him to rise. Usually, the footman did this, and was violently sworn at when his lordship had an extra twinge of gout. The Earl was not a very polite person as a rule, and many a time the huge footmen about him quaked inside their imposing liveries.

But this evening he did not swear, though his gouty foot gave him more twinges than one. He chose to try an experiment. He got up slowly and put his hand on the small shoulder presented to him with so much courage. Little Lord Fauntleroy made a careful step forward, looking down at the gouty foot.

"Just lean on me," he said, with encouraging good cheer. "I'll walk very slowly."

If the Earl had been supported by the footman he would have rested less on his stick and more on his assistant's arm. And yet it was part of his experiment to let his grandson feel his burden as no light weight. It was quite a heavy weight indeed, and after a few steps his young lordship's face grew quite hot, and his heart beat rather fast, but he braced himself sturdily, remembering his muscle and Dick's approval of it.

"Don't be afraid of leaning on me," he panted. "I'm all right—if—if it isn't a very long way."

It was not really very far to the dining-room, but it seemed rather a long way to Cedric, before they reached the chair at the head of the table. The hand on his shoulder seemed to grow heavier at every step, and his face grew redder and hotter, and his breath shorter, but he never thought of giving up; he stiffened his childish muscles, held his head erect, and encouraged the Earl as he limped along.

"Does your foot hurt you very much when you stand on it?" he asked."Did you ever put it in hot water and mustard? Mr. Hobbs used to put his in hot water. Arnica is a very nice thing, they tell me."

The big dog stalked slowly beside them, and the big footman followed; several times he looked very queer as he watched the little figure making the very most of all its strength, and bearing its burden with such goodwill. The Earl, too, looked rather queer, once, as he glanced sidewise down at the flushed little face. When they entered the room where they were to dine, Cedric saw it was a very large and imposing one, and that the footman who stood behind the chair at the head of the table stared very hard as they came in.

But they reached the chair at last. The hand was removed from his shoulder, and the Earl was fairly seated.

Cedric took out Dick's handkerchief and wiped his forehead.

"It's a warm night, isn't it?" he said. "Perhaps you need a fire because—because of your foot, but it seems just a little warm to me."

His delicate consideration for his noble relative's feelings was such that he did not wish to seem to intimate that any of his surroundings were unnecessary.

"You have been doing some rather hard work," said the Earl.

"Oh, no!" said Lord Fauntleroy, "it wasn't exactly hard, but I got a little warm. A person will get warm in summer time."

And he rubbed his damp curls rather vigorously with the gorgeous handkerchief. His own chair was placed at the other end of the table, opposite his grandfather's. It was a chair with arms, and intended for a much larger individual than himself; indeed, everything he had seen so far,—the great rooms, with their high ceilings, the massive furniture, the big footman, the big dog, the Earl himself,—were all of proportions calculated to make this little lad feel that he was very small, indeed. But that did not trouble him; he had never thought himself very large or important, and he was quite willing to accommodate himself even to circumstances which rather overpowered him.

Perhaps he had never looked so little a fellow as when seated now in his great chair, at the end of the table. Notwithstanding his solitary existence, the Earl chose to live in some state. He was fond of his dinner, and he dined in a formal style. Cedric looked at him across a glitter of splendid glass and plate, which to his unaccustomed eyes seemed quite dazzling. A stranger looking on might well have smiled at the picture,—the great stately room, the big liveried servants, the bright lights, the glittering silver and glass, the fierce-looking old nobleman at the head of the table and the very small boy at the foot. Dinner was usually a very serious matter with the Earl—and it was a very serious matter with the cook, if his lordship was not pleased or had an indifferent appetite. To-day, however, his appetite seemed a trifle better than usual, perhaps because he had something to think of beside the flavor of the entrees and the management of the gravies. His grandson gave him something to think of. He kept looking at him across the table. He did not say very much himself, but he managed to make the boy talk. He had never imagined that he could be entertained by hearing a child talk, but Lord Fauntleroy at once puzzled and amused him, and he kept remembering how he had let the childish shoulder feel his weight just for the sake of trying how far the boy's courage and endurance would go, and it pleased him to know that his grandson had not quailed and had not seemed to think even for a moment of giving up what he had undertaken to do.

"You don't wear your coronet all the time?" remarked Lord Fauntleroy respectfully.

"No," replied the Earl, with his grim smile; "it is not becoming to me."

"Mr. Hobbs said you always wore it," said Cedric; "but after he thought it over, he said he supposed you must sometimes take it off to put your hat on."

"Yes," said the Earl, "I take it off occasionally."

And one of the footmen suddenly turned aside and gave a singular little cough behind his hand.

Cedric finished his dinner first, and then he leaned back in his chair and took a survey of the room.

"You must be very proud of your house," he said, "it's such a beautiful house. I never saw anything so beautiful; but, of course, as I'm only seven, I haven't seen much."

"And you think I must be proud of it, do you?" said the Earl.

"I should think any one would be proud of it," replied Lord Fauntleroy. "I should be proud of it if it were my house. Everything about it is beautiful. And the park, and those trees,—how beautiful they are, and how the leaves rustle!"

Then he paused an instant and looked across the table rather wistfully.

"It's a very big house for just two people to live in, isn't it?" he said.

"It is quite large enough for two," answered the Earl."Do you find it too large?"

His little lordship hesitated a moment.

"I was only thinking," he said, "that if two people lived in it who were not very good companions, they might feel lonely sometimes."

"Do you think I shall make a good companion?" inquired the Earl.

"Yes," replied Cedric, "I think you will. Mr. Hobbs and I were great friends. He was the best friend I had except Dearest."

The Earl made a quick movement of his bushy eyebrows.

"Who is Dearest?"

"She is my mother," said Lord Fauntleroy, in a rather low, quiet little voice.

Perhaps he was a trifle tired, as his bed-time was nearing, and perhaps after the excitement of the last few days it was natural he should be tired, so perhaps, too, the feeling of weariness brought to him a vague sense of loneliness in the remembrance that to-night he was not to sleep at home, watched over by the loving eyes of that "best friend" of his. They had always been "best friends," this boy and his young mother. He could not help thinking of her, and the more he thought of her the less was he inclined to talk, and by the time the dinner was at an end the Earl saw that there was a faint shadow on his face. But Cedric bore himself with excellent courage, and when they went back to the library, though the tall footman walked on one side of his master, the Earl's hand rested on his grandson's shoulder, though not so heavily as before.

When the footman left them alone, Cedric sat down upon the hearth-rug near Dougal. For a few minutes he stroked the dog's ears in silence and looked at the fire.

The Earl watched him. The boy's eyes looked wistful and thoughtful, and once or twice he gave a little sigh. The Earl sat still, and kept his eyes fixed on his grandson.

"Fauntleroy," he said at last, "what are you thinking of?"

Fauntleroy looked up with a manful effort at a smile.

"I was thinking about Dearest," he said; "and—and I think I'd better get up and walk up and down the room."

He rose up, and put his hands in his small pockets, and began to walk to and fro. His eyes were very bright, and his lips were pressed together, but he kept his head up and walked firmly. Dougal moved lazily and looked at him, and then stood up. He walked over to the child, and began to follow him uneasily. Fauntleroy drew one hand from his pocket and laid it on the dog's head.

"He's a very nice dog," he said. "He's my friend. He knows how I feel."

"How do you feel?" asked the Earl.

It disturbed him to see the struggle the little fellow was having with his first feeling of homesickness, but it pleased him to see that he was making so brave an effort to bear it well. He liked this childish courage.

"Come here," he said.

Fauntleroy went to him.

"I never was away from my own house before," said the boy, with a troubled look in his brown eyes. "It makes a person feel a strange feeling when he has to stay all night in another person's castle instead of in his own house. But Dearest is not very far away from me. She told me to remember that—and—and I'm seven—and I can look at the picture she gave me."

He put his hand in his pocket, and brought out a small violet velvetcovered case.

"This is it," he said."You see, you press this spring and it opens, and she is in there!"

He had come close to the Earl's chair, and, as he drew forth the little case, he leaned against the arm of it, and against the old man's arm, too, as confidingly as if children had always leaned there.

"There she is," he said, as the case opened; and he looked up with a smile.

The Earl knitted his brows; he did not wish to see the picture, but he looked at it in spite of himself; and there looked up at him from it such a pretty young face—a face so like the child's at his side—that it quite started him.

"I suppose you think you are very fond of her," he said.

"Yes," answered Lord Fauntleroy, in a gentle tone, and with simple directness; "I do think so, and I think it's true. You see, Mr. Hobbs was my friend, and Dick and Bridget and Mary and Michael, they were my friends, too; but Dearest—well, she is my CLOSE friend, and we always tell each other everything. My father left her to me to take care of, and when I am a man I am going to work and earn money for her."

"What do you think of doing?" inquired his grandfather.

His young lordship slipped down upon the hearth-rug, and sat there with the picture still in his hand. He seemed to be reflecting seriously, before he answered.

"I did think perhaps I might go into business with Mr. Hobbs," he said; "but I should LIKE to be a President."

"We'll send you to the House of Lords instead," said his grandfather.

"Well," remarked Lord Fauntleroy, "if I COULDN'T be a President, and if that is a good business, I shouldn't mind. The grocery business is dull sometimes."

Perhaps he was weighing the matter in his mind, for he sat very quiet after this, and looked at the fire for some time.

The Earl did not speak again. He leaned back in his chair and watched him. A great many strange new thoughts passed through the old nobleman's mind. Dougal had stretched himself out and gone to sleep with his head on his huge paws. There was a long silence.

In about half an hour's time Mr. Havisham was ushered in. The great room was very still when he entered. The Earl was still leaning back in his chair. He moved as Mr. Havisham approached, and held up his hand in a gesture of warning—it seemed as if he had scarcely intended to make the gesture—as if it were almost involuntary. Dougal was still asleep, and close beside the great dog, sleeping also, with his curly head upon his arm, lay little Lord Fauntleroy.





Chapter 6　The Earl and His Grandson


When Lord Fauntleroy wakened in the morning,—he had not wakened at all when he had been carried to bed the night before,—the first sounds he was conscious of were the crackling of a wood fire and the murmur of voices.

"You will be careful, Dawson, not to say anything about it," he heard some one say. "He does not know why she is not to be with him, and the reason is to be kept from him."

"If them's his lordship's orders, mem," another voice answered, "they'll have to be kep', I suppose. But, if you'll excuse the liberty, mem, as it's between ourselves, servant or no servant, all I have to say is, it's a cruel thing, —parting that poor, pretty, young widdered cre'tur' from her own flesh and blood, and him such a little beauty and a nobleman born. James and Thomas, mem, last night in the servants' hall, they both of 'em say as they never see anythink in their two lives—nor yet no other gentleman in livery—like that little fellow's ways, as innercent an' polite an' interested as if he'd been sitting there dining with his best friend, —and the temper of a' angel, instead of one (if you'll excuse me, mem), as it's well known, is enough to curdle your blood in your veins at times. And as to looks, mem, when we was rung for, James and me, to go into the library and bring him upstairs, and James lifted him up in his arms, what with his little innercent face all red and rosy, and his little head on James's shoulder and his hair hanging down, all curly an' shinin', a prettier, takiner sight you'd never wish to see. An' it's my opinion, my lord wasn't blind to it neither, for he looked at him, and he says to James, 'See you don't wake him!' he says."

Cedric moved on his pillow, and turned over, opening his eyes.

There were two women in the room. Everything was bright and cheerful with gay-flowered chintz. There was a fire on the hearth, and the sunshine was streaming in through the ivy-entwined windows. Both women came toward him, and he saw that one of them was Mrs. Mellon, the housekeeper, and the other a comfortable, middle-aged woman, with aface as kind and good-humored as a face could be.

"Good-morning, my lord," said Mrs. Mellon."Did you sleep well?"

His lordship rubbed his eyes and smiled.

"Good-morning," he said. "I didn't know I was here."

"You were carried upstairs when you were asleep," said the housekeeper. "This is your bedroom, and this is Dawson, who is to take care of you."

Fauntleroy sat up in bed and held out his hand to Dawson, as he had held it out to the Earl.

"How do you do, ma'am?" he said. "I'm much obliged to you for coming to take care of me."

"You can call her Dawson, my lord," said the housekeeper with a smile. "She is used to being called Dawson."

"MISS Dawson, or MRS. Dawson?" inquired his lordship.

"Just Dawson, my lord," said Dawson herself, beaming all over. "Neither Miss nor Missis, bless your little heart! Will you get up now, and let Dawson dress you, and then have your breakfast in the nursery?"

"I learned to dress myself many years ago, thank you," answered Fauntleroy. "Dearest taught me. 'Dearest' is my mamma. We had only Mary to do all the work,—washing and all,—and so of course it wouldn't do to give her so much trouble. I can take my bath, too, pretty well if you'll just be kind enough to'zaminethe corners after I'm done."

Dawson and the housekeeper exchanged glances.

"Dawson will do anything you ask her to," said Mrs. Mellon.

"That I will, bless him," said Dawson, in her comforting, goodhumored voice. "He shall dress himself if he likes, and I'll stand by, ready to help him if he wants me."

"Thank you," responded Lord Fauntleroy; "it's a little hard sometimes about the buttons, you know, and then I have to ask somebody."

He thought Dawson a very kind woman, and before the bath and the dressing were finished they were excellent friends, and he had found out a great deal about her. He had discovered that her husband had been a soldier and had been killed in a real battle, and that her son was a sailor, and was away on a long cruise, and that he had seen pirates and cannibals and Chinese people and Turks, and that he brought home strange shells and pieces of coral which Dawson was ready to show at any moment, some of them being in her trunk. All this was very interesting. He also found out that she had taken care of little children all her life, and that she had just come from a great house in another part of England, where she had been taking care of a beautiful little girl whose name was Lady Gwyneth Vaughn.

"And she is a sort of relation of your lordship's," said Dawson. "And perhaps sometime you may see her."

"Do you think I shall?" said Fauntleroy. "I should like that. I never knew any little girls, but I always like to look at them."

When he went into the adjoining room to take his breakfast, and saw what a great room it was, and found there was another adjoining it which Dawson told him was his also, the feeling that he was very small indeed came over him again so strongly that he confided it to Dawson, as he sat down to the table on which the pretty breakfast service was arranged.

"I am a very little boy," he said rather wistfully, "to live in such a large castle, and have so many big rooms,—don't you think so?"

"Oh! come!" said Dawson, "you feel just a little strange at first, that's all; but you'll get over that very soon, and then you'll like it here. It's such a beautiful place, you know."

"It's a very beautiful place, of course," said Fauntleroy, with a little sigh; "but I should like it better if I didn't miss Dearest so. I always had my breakfast with her in the morning, and put the sugar and cream in her tea for her, and handed her the toast. That made it very sociable, of course."

"Oh, well!" answered Dawson, comfortingly,"you know you can see her every day, and there's no knowing how much you'll have to tell her. Bless you! wait till you've walked about a bit and seen things,—the dogs, and the stables with all the horses in them. There's one of them I know you'll like to see—"

"Is there?" exclaimed Fauntleroy; "I'm very fond of horses. I was very fond of Jim. He was the horse that belonged to Mr. Hobbs' grocery wagon. He was a beautiful horse when he wasn't balky."

"Well," said Dawson,"you just wait till you've seen what's in the stables. And, deary me, you haven't looked even into the very next room yet!"

"What is there?" asked Fauntleroy.

"Wait until you've had your breakfast, and then you shall see," said Dawson.

At this he naturally began to grow curious, and he applied himself assiduously to his breakfast. It seemed to him that there must be something worth looking at, in the next room; Dawson had such a consequential, mysterious air.

"Now, then," he said, slipping off his seat a few minutes later; "I've had enough. Can I go and look at it?"

Dawson nodded and led the way, looking more mysterious and important than ever. He began to be very much interested indeed.

When she opened the door of the room, he stood upon the threshold and looked about him in amazement. He did not speak; he only put his hands in his pockets and stood there flushing up to his forehead and looking in.

He flushed up because he was so surprised and, for the moment, excited. To see such a place was enough to surprise any ordinary boy.

The room was a large one, too, as all the rooms seemed to be, and it appeared to him more beautiful than the rest, only in a different way. The furniture was not so massive and antique as was that in the rooms he had seen downstairs; the draperies and rugs and walls were brighter; there were shelves full of books, and on the tables were numbers of toys,—beautiful, ingenious things,—such as he had looked at with wonder and delight through the shop windows in New York.

"It looks like a boy's room," he said at last, catching his breath a little. "Whom do they belong to?"

"Go and look at them," said Dawson. "They belong to you!"

"To me!" he cried; "to me? Why do they belong to me? Who gave them to me?" And he sprang forward with a gay little shout. It seemed almost too much to be believed. "It was Grandpapa!" he said, with his eyes as bright as stars. "I know it was Grandpapa!"

"Yes, it was his lordship," said Dawson; "and if you will be a nice little gentleman, and not fret about things, and will enjoy yourself, and be happy all the day, he will give you anything you ask for."

It was a tremendously exciting morning. There were so many things to be examined, so many experiments to be tried; each novelty was so absorbing that he could scarcely turn from it to look at the next. And it was so curious to know that all this had been prepared for himself alone; that, even before he had left New York, people had come down from London to arrange the rooms he was to occupy, and had provided the books and playthings most likely to interest him.

"Did you ever know any one," he said to Dawson, "who had such a kind grandfather!"

Dawson's face wore an uncertain expression for a moment. She had not a very high opinion of his lordship the Earl. She had not been in the house many days, but she had been there long enough to hear the old nobleman's peculiarities discussed very freely in the servants' hall.

"An' of all the wicious, savage, hill-tempered hold fellows it was ever my hill-luck to wear livery hunder," the tallest footman had said, "he's the wiolentest and wust by a long shot."

And this particular footman, whose name was Thomas, had also repeated to his companions below stairs some of the Earl's remarks to Mr. Havisham, when they had been discussing these very preparations.

"Give him his own way, and fill his rooms with toys," my lord had said. "Give him what will amuse him, and he'll forget about his mother quickly enough. Amuse him, and fill his mind with other things, and we shall have no trouble. That's boy nature."

So, perhaps, having had this truly amiable object in view, it did not please him so very much to find it did not seem to be exactly this particular boy's nature. The Earl had passed a bad night and had spent the morning in his room; but at noon, after he had lunched, he sent for his grandson.

Fauntleroy answered the summons at once. He came down the broad staircase with a bounding step; the Earl heard him run across the hall, and then the door opened and he came in with red cheeks and sparkling eyes.

"I was waiting for you to send for me," he said. "I was ready a long time ago. I'm EVER so much obliged to you for all those things! I'm EVER so much obliged to you! I have been playing with them all the morning."

"Oh!" said the Earl, "you like them, do you?"

"I like them so much—well, I couldn't tell you how much!" said Fauntleroy, his face glowing with delight. "There's one that's like baseball, only you play it on a board with black and white pegs, and you keep your score with some counters on a wire. I tried to teach Dawson, but she couldn't quite understand it just at first—you see, she never played baseball, being a lady; and I'm afraid I wasn't very good at explaining it to her. But you know all about it, don't you?"

"I'm afraid I don't," replied the Earl. "It's an American game, isn't it? Is it something like cricket?"

"I never saw cricket," said Fauntleroy; "but Mr. Hobbs took me several times to see baseball. It's a splendid game. You get so excited! Would you like me to go and get my game and show it to you? Perhaps it would amuse you and make you forget about your foot. Does your foot hurt you very much this morning?"

"More than I enjoy," was the answer.

"Then perhaps you couldn't forget it," said the little fellow anxiously. "Perhaps it would bother you to be told about the game. Do you think it would amuse you, or do you think it would bother you?"

"Go and get it," said the Earl.

It certainly was a novel entertainment this,—making a companion of a child who offered to teach him to play games,—but the very novelty of it amused him. There was a smile lurking about the Earl's mouth when Cedric came back with the box containing the game, in his arms, and an expression of the most eager interest on his face.

"May I pull that little table over here to your chair?" he asked.

"Ring for Thomas," said the Earl. "He will place it for you."

"Oh, I can do it myself," answered Fauntleroy. "It's not very heavy."

"Very well," replied his grandfather. The lurking smile deepened on the old man's face as he watched the little fellow's preparations; there was such an absorbed interest in them. The small table was dragged forward and placed by his chair, and the game taken from its box and arranged upon it.

"It's very interesting when you once begin," said Fauntleroy. "You see, the black pegs can be your side and the white ones mine. They're men, you know, and once round the field is a home run and counts one—and these are the outs—and here is the first base and that's the second and that's the third and that's the home base."

He entered into the details of explanation with the greatest animation. He showed all the attitudes of pitcher and catcher and batter in the real game, and gave a dramatic description of a wonderful "hot ball" he had seen caught on the gloriousoccasion on which he had witnessed a match in company with Mr. Hobbs. His vigorous, graceful little body, his eager gestures, his simple enjoyment of it all, were pleasant to behold.

When at last the explanations and illustrations were at an end and the game began in good earnest, the Earl still found himself entertained. His young companion was wholly absorbed; he played with all his childish heart; his gay little laughs when he made a good throw, his enthusiasm over a "home run," his impartial delight over his own good luck and his opponent's, would have given a flavor to any game.

If, a week before, any one had told the Earl of Dorincourt that on that particular morning he would be forgetting his gout and his bad temper in a child's game, played with black and white wooden pegs, on a gayly painted board, with a curly-headed small boy for a companion, he would without doubt have made himself very unpleasant; and yet he certainly had forgotten himself when the door opened and Thomas announced a visitor.

The visitor in question, who was an elderly gentleman in black, and no less aperson than the clergyman of the parish, was so startled by the amazing scene which met his eye, that he almost fell back a pace, and ran some risk of colliding with Thomas.

There was, in fact, no part of his duty that the Reverend Mr. Mordaunt found so decidedly unpleasant as that part which compelled him to call upon his noblepatron at the Castle. His noble patron, indeed, usually made these visits asdisagreeable as it lay in his lordly power to make them. He abhorred churches andcharities, and flew into violent rages when any of his tenantry took the liberty ofbeing poor and ill and needing assistance. When his gout was at its worst, he did nothesitate to announce that he would not be bored and irritated by being told storiesof their miserable misfortunes; when his gout troubled him less and he was in asomewhat more humane frame of mind, he would perhaps give the rector somemoney, after having bullied him in the most painful manner, and berated the wholeparish for its shiftlessness and imbecility. But, whatsoever his mood, he never failedto make as many sarcastic and embarrassing speeches as possible, and to cause the Reverend Mr. Mordaunt to wish it were proper and Christian-like to throw something heavy at him. During all the years in which Mr. Mordaunt had been in charge of Dorincourt parish, the rector certainly did not remember having seen his lordship, ofhis own free will, do any one a kindness, or, under any circumstances whatever, show that he thought of any one but himself.

He had called to-day to speak to him of a specially pressing case, and as hehad walked up the avenue, he had, for two reasons, dreaded his visit more thanusual. In the first place, he knew that his lordship had for several days been suffering with the gout, and had been in so villainous a humor that rumors of it had evenreached the village—carried there by one of the young women servants, to her sister, who kept a little shop and retailed darning-needles and cotton and peppermints and gossip, as a means of earning an honest living. What Mrs. Dibble did not know aboutthe Castle and its inmates, and the farm-houses and their inmates, and the villageand its population, was really not worth being talked about. And of course she knew everything about the Castle, because her sister, Jane Shorts, was one of the upper housemaids, and was very friendly and intimate with Thomas.

"And the way his lordship do go on!" said Mrs. Dibble, over the counter, "and the way he do use language, Mr. Thomas told Jane herself, no flesh and blood as is inlivery could stand—for throw a plate of toast at Mr. Thomas, hisself, he did, not morethan two days since, and if it weren't for other things being agreeable and the society below stairs most genteel, warning would have been gave within a' hour!"

And the rector had heard all this, for somehow the Earl was a favorite black sheep in the cottages and farm-houses, and his bad behavior gave many a good woman something to talk about when she had company to tea.

And the second reason was even worse, because it was a new one and had been talked about with the most excited interest.

Who did not know of the old nobleman's fury when his handsome son the Captain had married the American lady? Who did not know how cruelly he had treated the Captain, and how the big, gay, sweet-smiling young man, who was theonly member of the grand family any one liked, had died in a foreign land, poor and unforgiven? Who did not know how fiercely his lordship had hated the poor young creature who had been this son's wife, and how he had hated the thought of herchild and never meant to see the boy—until his two sons died and left him without anheir? And then, who did not know that he had looked forward without any affection or pleasure to his grandson's coming, and that he had made up his mind that he should find the boy a vulgar, awkward, pert American lad, more likely to disgrace his noble name than to honor it?

The proud, angry old man thought he had kept all his thoughts secret. He did not suppose any one had dared to guess at, much less talk over what he felt, and dreaded; but his servants watched him, and read his face and his ill-humors and fits of gloom, and discussed them in the servants' hall. And while he thought himself quite secure from the common herd, Thomas was telling Jane and the cook, and the butler, and the housemaids and the other footmen that it was his opinion that "the hold man was wuss than usual a-thinkin' hover the Capting's boy, an' hanticipatin' as he won't be no credit to the fambly. An' serve him right," added Thomas; "hit's 'is hown fault. Wot can he iggspect from a child brought up in pore circumstances in that there low Hamerica?"

And as the Reverend Mr. Mordaunt walked under the great trees, he remembered that this questionable little boy had arrived at the Castle only the evening before, and that there were nine chances to one that his lordship's worst fears were realized, and twenty-two chances to one that if the poor little fellow had disappointed him, the Earl was even now in a tearing rage, and ready to vent all his rancor on the first person who called—which it appeared probable would be his reverend self.

Judge then of his amazement when, as Thomas opened the library door, his ears were greeted by a delighted ring of childish laughter.

"That's two out!" shouted an excited, clear little voice. "You see it's two out!"

And there was the Earl's chair, and the gout-stool, and his foot on it; and by him a small table and a game on it; and quite close to him, actually leaning against his arm and his ungouty knee, was a little boy with face glowing, and eyes dancing with excitement. "It's two out!" the little stranger cried. "You hadn't any luck that time, had you?"—And then they both recognized at once that some one had come in.

The Earl glanced around, knitting his shaggy eyebrows as he had a trick of doing, and when he saw who it was, Mr. Mordaunt was still more surprised to see that he looked even less disagreeable than usual instead of more so. In fact, he looked almost as if he had forgotten for the moment how disagreeable he was, and how unpleasant he really could make himself when he tried.

"Ah!" he said, in his harsh voice, but giving his hand rather graciously. "Good-morning, Mordaunt. I've found a new employment, you see."

He put his other hand on Cedric's shoulder, —perhaps deep down in his heart there was a stir of gratified pride that it was such an heir he had to present; there was a spark of something like pleasure in his eyes as he moved the boy slightly forward.

"This is the new Lord Fauntleroy," he said. "Fauntleroy, this is Mr. Mordaunt, the rector of the parish."

Fauntleroy looked up at the gentleman in the clerical garments, and gave him his hand.

"I am very glad to make your acquaintance, sir," he said, remembering the words he had heard Mr. Hobbs use on one or two occasions when he had been greeting a new customer with ceremony.

Cedric felt quite sure that one ought to be more than usually polite to a minister.

Mr. Mordaunt held the small hand in his a moment as he looked down at the child's face, smiling involuntarily. He liked the little fellow from that instant—as in fact people always did like him. And it was not the boy's beauty and grace which most appealed to him; it was the simple, natural kindliness in the little lad which made any words he uttered, however quaint and unexpected, sound pleasant and sincere. As the rector looked at Cedric, he forgot to think of the Earl at all. Nothing in the world is so strong as a kind heart, and somehow this kind little heart, though it was only the heart of a child, seemed to clear all the atmosphere of the big gloomy room and make it brighter.

"I am delighted to make your acquaintance, Lord Fauntleroy," said the rector. "You made a long journey to come to us. A great many people will be glad to know you made it safely."

"It WAS a long way," answered Fauntleroy, "but Dearest, my mother, was with me and I wasn't lonely. Of course you are never lonely if your mother is with you; and the ship was beautiful."

"Take a chair, Mordaunt," said the Earl. Mr. Mordaunt sat down. He glanced from Fauntleroy to the Earl.

"Your lordship is greatly to be congratulated," he said warmly.

But the Earl plainly had no intention of showing his feelings on the subject.

"He is like his father," he said rather gruffly. "Let us hope he'll conduct himself more creditably." And then he added: "Well, what is it this morning, Mordaunt? Who is in trouble now?"

This was not as bad as Mr. Mordaunt had expected, but he hesitated a second before he began.

"It is Higgins," he said; "Higgins of Edge Farm. He has been very unfortunate. He was ill himself last autumn, and his children had scarlet fever. I can't say that he is a very good manager, but he has had ill-luck, and of course he is behindhand in many ways. He is in trouble about his rent now. Newick tells him if he doesn't pay it, he must leave the place; and of course that would be a very serious matter. His wife is ill, and he came to me yesterday to beg me to see about it, and ask you for time. He thinks if you would give him time he could catch up again."

"They all think that," said the Earl, looking rather black.

Fauntleroy made a movement forward. He had been standing between his grandfather and the visitor, listening with all his might. He had begun to be interested in Higgins at once. He wondered how many children there were, and if the scarlet fever had hurt them very much. His eyes were wide open and were fixed upon Mr. Mordaunt with intent interest as that gentleman went on with the conversation.

"Higgins is a well-meaning man," said the rector, making an effort to strengthen his plea.

"He is a bad enough tenant," replied his lordship. "And he is always behindhand, Newick tells me."

"He is in great trouble now," said the rector.

"He is very fond of his wife and children, and if the farm is taken from him they may literally starve. He can not give them the nourishing things they need. Two of the children were left very low after the fever, and the doctor orders for them wine and luxuries that Higgins can not afford."

At this Fauntleroy moved a step nearer.

"That was the way with Michael," he said.

The Earl slightly started.

"I forgot YOU!" he said. "I forgot we had a philanthropist in the room. Who was Michael?" And the gleam of queer amusement came back into the old man's deep-set eyes.

"He was Bridget's husband, who had the fever," answered Fauntleroy; "and he couldn't pay the rent or buy wine and things. And you gave me that money to help him."

The Earl drew his brows together into a curious frown, which somehow was scarcely grim at all. He glanced across at Mr. Mordaunt.

"I don't know what sort of landed proprietor he will make," he said: "I told Havisham the boy was to have what he wanted—anything he wanted—and what he wanted, it seems, was money to give to beggars."

"Oh! but they weren't beggars," said Fauntleroy eagerly. "Michael was a splendid bricklayer! They all worked."

"Oh!" said the Earl, "they were not beggars. They were splendid bricklayers, and bootblacks, and apple-women."

He bent his gaze on the boy for a few seconds in silence. The fact was that a new thought was coming to him, and though, perhaps, it was not prompted by the noblest emotions, it was not a bad thought. "Come here," he said, at last.

Fauntleroy went and stood as near to him as possible without encroaching on the gouty foot.

"What would YOU do in this case?" his lordship asked.

It must be confessed that Mr. Mordaunt experienced for the moment a curious sensation. Being a man of great thoughtfulness, and having spent so many years on the estate of Dorincourt, knowing the tenantry, rich and poor, the people of the village, honest and industrious, dishonest and lazy, he realized very strongly what power for good or evil would be given in the future to this one small boy standing there, his brown eyes wide open, his hands deep in his pockets; and the thought came to him also that a great deal of power might, perhaps, through the caprice of a proud, selfindulgent old man, be given to him now, and that if his young nature were not a simple and generous one, it might be the worst thing that could happen, not only for others, but for himself.

"And what would YOU do in such a case?" demanded the Earl.

Fauntleroy drew a little nearer, and laid one hand on his knee, with the most confiding air of good comradeship.

"If I were very rich," he said, "and not only just a little boy, I should let him stay, and give him the things for his children; but then, I am only a boy." Then, after a second's pause, in which his face brightened visibly, "YOU can do anything, can't you?" he said.

"Humph!" said my lord, staring at him. "That's your opinion, is it?" And he was not displeased either.

"I mean you can give any one anything," said Fauntleroy. "Who's Newick?"

"He is my agent," answered the earl, "and some of my tenants are not over-fond of him."

"Are you going to write him a letter now?" inquired Fauntleroy. "Shall I bring you the pen and ink? I can take the game off this table."

The Earl paused a moment, still looking at him. "Can you write?" he asked.

"Yes," answered Cedric, "but not very well."

"Move the things from the table," commanded my lord, "and bring the pen and ink, and a sheet of paper from my desk."

Mr. Mordaunt's interest began to increase. Fauntleroy did as he was told very deftly. In a few moments, the sheet of paper, the big inkstand, and the pen were ready.

"There!" he said gayly, "now you can write it."

"You are to write it," said the Earl.

"I!" exclaimed Fauntleroy, and a flush overspread his forehead. "Will it do if I write it? I don't always spell quite right when I haven't a dictionary, and nobody tells me."

"It will do," answered the Earl. "Higgins will not complain of the spelling. I'm not the philanthropist; you are. Dip your pen in the ink."

Fauntleroy took up the pen and dipped it in the ink-bottle, then he arranged himself in position, leaning on the table.

"Now," he inquired, "what must I say?"

"You may say, 'Higgins is not to be interfered with, for the present,' and sign it, 'Fauntleroy,'" said the Earl.

Fauntleroy dipped his pen in the ink again, and resting his arm, began to write. It was rather a slow and serious process, but he gave his whole soul to it. After a while, however, the manuscript was complete, and he handed it to his grandfather with a smile slightly tinged with anxiety.

"Do you think it will do?" he asked.

The Earl looked at it, and the corners of his mouth twitched a little.

"Yes," he answered; "Higgins will find it entirely satisfactory." And he handed it to Mr. Mordaunt.

What Mr. Mordaunt found written was this:

"Dear mr. Newik if you pleas mr. higins is not to be intur feared with for the present and oblige. Yours rispecferly.

"FAUNTLEROY."

"Mr. Hobbs always signed his letters that way," said Fauntleroy; "and I thought I'd better say 'please.' Is that exactly the right way to spell 'interfered'?"

"It's not exactly the way it is spelled in the dictionary," answered the Earl.

"I was afraid of that," said Fauntleroy. "I ought to have asked. You see, that's the way with words of more than one syllable; you have to look in the dictionary. It's always safest. I'll write it over again."

And write it over again he did, making quite an imposing copy, and taking precautions in the matter of spelling by consulting the Earl himself.

"Spelling is a curious thing," he said. "It's so often different from what you expect it to be. I used to think 'please' was spelled p-l-e-e-s, but it isn't, you know; and you'd think 'dear' was spelled d-e-r-e, if you didn't inquire. Sometimes it almost discourages you."

When Mr. Mordaunt went away, he took the letter with him, and he took something else with him also—namely, a pleasanter feeling and a more hopeful one than he had ever carried home with him down that avenue on any previous visit he had made at Dorincourt Castle.

When he was gone, Fauntleroy, who had accompanied him to the door, went back to his grandfather.

"May I go to Dearest now?" he asked. "I think she will be waiting for me."

The Earl was silent a moment.

"There is something in the stable for you to see first," he said. "Ring the bell."

"If you please," said Fauntleroy, with his quick little flush. "I'm very much obliged; but I think I'd better see it to-morrow. She will be expecting me all the time."

"Very well," answered the Earl. "We will order the carriage." Then he added dryly, "It's a pony."

Fauntleroy drew a long breath.

"A pony!" he exclaimed. "Whose pony is it?"

"Yours," replied the Earl.

"Mine?" cried the little fellow. "Mine—like the things upstairs?"

"Yes," said his grandfather. "Would you like to see it? Shall I order it to be brought around?"

Fauntleroy's cheeks grew redder and redder.

"I never thought I should have a pony!" he said. "I never thought that! How glad Dearest will be. You give me EVERYthing, don't you?"

"Do you wish to see it?" inquired the Earl.

Fauntleroy drew a long breath. "I WANT to see it," he said. "I want to see it so much I can hardly wait. But I'm afraid there isn't time."

"You MUST go and see your mother this afternoon?" asked the Earl. "You think you can't put it off?"

"Why," said Fauntleroy, "she has been thinking about me all the morning, and I have been thinking about her!"

"Oh!" said the Earl."You have, have you? Ring the bell."

As they drove down the avenue, under the arching trees, he was rather silent. But Fauntleroy was not. He talked about the pony. What color was it? How big was it? What was its name? What did it like to eat best? How old was it? How early in the morning might he get up and see it?

"Dearest will be so glad!" he kept saying. "She will be so much obliged to you for being so kind to me! She knows I always liked ponies so much, but we never thought I should have one. There was a little boy on Fifth Avenue who had one, and he used to ride out every morning and we used to take a walk past his house to see him."

He leaned back against the cushions and regarded the Earl with rapt interest for a few minutes and in entire silence.

"I think you must be the best person in the world," he burst forth at last."You are always doing good, aren't you?—and thinking about other people. Dearest says that is the best kind of goodness; not to think about yourself, but to think about other people. That is just the way you are, isn't it?"

His lordship was so dumfounded to find himself presented in such agreeable colors, that he did not know exactly what to say. He felt that he needed time for reflection. To see each of his ugly, selfish motives changed into a good and generous one by the simplicity of a child was a singular experience.

Fauntleroy went on, still regarding him with admiring eyes—those great, clear, innocent eyes!

"You make so many people happy," he said. "There's Michael and Bridget and their ten children, and the apple-woman, and Dick, and Mr. Hobbs, and Mr. Higgins and Mrs. Higgins and their children, and Mr. Mordaunt,—because of course he was glad,—and Dearest and me, about the pony and all the other things. Do you know, I've counted it up on my fingers and in my mind, and it's twenty-seven people you've been kind to. That's a good many—twenty-seven!"

"And I was the person who was kind to them—was I?" said the Earl.

"Why, yes, you know," answered Fauntleroy."You made them all happy. Do you know," with some delicate hesitation, "that people are sometimes mistaken about earls when they don't know them. Mr. Hobbs was. I am going to write him, and tell him about it."

"What was Mr. Hobbs's opinion of earls?" asked his lordship.

"Well, you see, the difficulty was," replied his young companion, "that he didn't know any, and he'd only read about them in books. He thought—you mustn't mind it—that they were gory tyrants; and he said he wouldn't have them hanging around his store. But if he'd known YOU, I'm sure he would have felt quite different. I shall tell him about you."

"What shall you tell him?"

"I shall tell him," said Fauntleroy, glowing with enthusiasm, "that you are the kindest man I ever heard of. And you are always thinking of other people, and making them happy and—and I hope when I grow up, I shall be just like you."

"Just like me!" repeated his lordship, looking at the little kindling face. And a dull red crept up under his withered skin, and he suddenly turned his eyes away and looked out of the carriage window at the great beechtrees, with the sun shining on their glossy, red-brown leaves.

"JUST like you," said Fauntleroy, adding modestly, "if I can. Perhaps I'm not good enough, but I'm going to try."

The carriage rolled on down the stately avenue under the beautiful, broad-branched trees, through the spaces of green shade and lanes of golden sunlight. Fauntleroy saw again the lovely places where the ferns grew high and the bluebells swayed in the breeze; he saw the deer, standing or lying in the deep grass, turn their large, startled eyes as the carriage passed, and caught glimpses of the brown rabbits as they scurried away. He heard the whir of the partridges and the calls and songs of the birds, and it all seemed even more beautiful to him than before. All his heart was filled with pleasure and happiness in the beauty that was on every side. But the old Earl saw and heard very different things, thoughhe was apparently looking out too. He saw a long life, in which there had been neither generous deeds nor kind thoughts; he saw years in which a man who had been young and strong and rich and powerful had used his youth and strength and wealth and power only to please himself and kill time as the days and years succeeded each other; he saw this man, when the time had been killed and old age had come, solitary and without real friends in the midst of all his splendid wealth; he saw people who disliked or feared him, and people who would flatter and cringe to him, but no one who really cared whether he lived or died, unless they had something to gain or lose by it. He looked out on the broad acres which belonged to him, and he knew what Fauntleroy did not—how far they extended, what wealth they represented, and how many people had homes on their soil. And he knew, too,—another thing Fauntleroy did not,—that in all those homes, humble or well-to-do, there was probably not one person, however much he envied the wealth and stately name and power, and however willing he would have been to possess them, who would for an instant have thought of calling the noble owner "good," or wishing, as this simple-souled little boy had, to be like him.

And it was not exactly pleasant to reflect upon, even for a cynical, worldly old man, who had been sufficient unto himself for seventy years and who had never deigned to care what opinion the world held of him so long as it did not interfere with his comfort or entertainment. And the fact was, indeed, that he had never before condescended to reflect upon it at all; and he only did so now because a child had believed him better than he was, and by wishing to follow in his illustrious footsteps and imitate his example, had suggested to him the curious question whether he was exactly the person to take as a model.

Fauntleroy thought the Earl's foot must be hurting him, his brows knitted themselves together so, as he looked out at the park; and thinking this, the considerate little fellow tried not to disturb him, and enjoyed the trees and the ferns and the deer in silence.

But at last the carriage, having passed the gates and bowled through the green lanes for a short distance, stopped. They had reached Court Lodge; and Fauntleroy was out upon the ground almost before the big footman had time to open the carriage door.

The Earl wakened from his reverie with a start.

"What!" he said. "Are we here?"

"Yes," said Fauntleroy. "Let me give you your stick. Just lean on me when you get out."

"I am not going to get out," replied his lordship brusquely.

"Not—not to see Dearest?" exclaimed Fauntleroy with astonished face.

"'Dearest' will excuse me," said the Earl dryly. "Go to her and tell her that not even a new pony would keep you away."

"She will be disappointed," said Fauntleroy. "She will want to see you very much."

"I am afraid not," was the answer. "The carriage will call for you as we come back.—Tell Jeffries to drive on, Thomas."

Thomas closed the carriage door; and, after a puzzled look, Fauntleroy ran up the drive. The Earl had the opportunity—as Mr. Havisham once had—of seeing a pair of handsome, strong little legs flash over the ground with astonishing rapidity. Evidently their owner had no intention of losing any time. The carriage rolled slowly away, but his lordship did not at once lean back; he still looked out. Through a space in the trees he could see the house door; it was wide open. The little figure dashed up the steps; another figure—a little figure, too, slender and young, in its black gown—ran to meet it. It seemed as if they flew together, as Fauntleroy leaped into his mother's arms, hanging about her neck and covering her sweet young face with kisses.





Chapter 7　At Church


On the following Sunday morning, Mr. Mordaunt had a large congregation. Indeed, he could scarcely remember any Sunday on which the church had been so crowded. People appeared upon the scene who seldom did him the honor of coming to hear his sermons.

There were even people from Hazelton, which was the next parish. There were hearty, sunburned farmers, stout, comfortable, apple-cheeked wives in their best bonnets and most gorgeous shawls, and half a dozen children or so to each family. The doctor's wife was there, with her four daughters. Mrs. Kimsey and Mr. Kimsey, who kept the druggist's shop, and made pills, and did up powders for everybody within ten miles, sat in their pew; Mrs. Dibble in hers; Miss Smiff, the village dressmaker, and her friend Miss Perkins, the milliner, sat in theirs; the doctor's young man was present, and the druggist's apprentice; in fact, almost every family on the county side was represented, in one way or another.

In the course of the preceding week, many wonderful stories had been told of little Lord Fauntleroy. Mrs. Dibble had been kept so busy attending to customers who came in to buy a pennyworth of needles or a ha'porth of tape and to hear what she had to relate, that the little shop bell over the door had nearly tinkled itself to death over the coming and going. Mrs. Dibble knew exactly how his small lordship's rooms had been furnished for him, what expensive toys had been bought, how there was a beautiful brown pony awaiting him, and a small groom to attend it, and a little dog-cart, with silver-mounted harness. And she could tell, too, what all the servants had said when they had caught glimpses of the child on the night of his arrival; and how every female below stairs had said it was a shame, so it was, to part the poor pretty dear from his mother; and had all declared their hearts came into their mouths when he went alone into the library to see his grandfather, for "there was no knowing how he'd be treated, and his lordship's temper was enough to fluster them with old heads on their shoulders, let alone a child."

"But if you'll believe me, Mrs. Jennifer, mum," Mrs. Dibble had said, "fear that child does not know—so Mr. Thomas hisself says; an' set an' smile he did, an' talked to his lordship as if they'd been friends ever since his first hour. An' the Earl so took aback, Mr. Thomas says, that he couldn't do nothing but listen and stare from under his eyebrows. An' it's Mr. Thomas's opinion, Mrs. Bates, mum, that bad as he is, he was pleased in his secret soul, an' proud, too; for a handsomer little fellow, or with better manners, though so old-fashioned, Mr. Thomas says he'd never wish to see."

And then there had come the story of Higgins. The Reverend Mr. Mordaunt had told it at his own dinner table, and the servants who had heard it had told it in the kitchen, and from there it had spread like wildfire.

And on market-day, when Higgins had appeared in town, he had been questioned on every side, and Newick had been questioned too, and in response had shown to two or three people the note signed "Fauntleroy."

And so the farmers' wives had found plenty to talk of over their tea and their shopping, and they had done the subject full justice and made the most of it. And on Sunday they had either walked to church or had been driven in their gigs by their husbands, who were perhaps a trifle curious themselves about the new little lord who was to be in time the owner of the soil.

It was by no means the Earl's habit to attend church, but he chose to appear on this first Sunday—it was his whim to present himself in the huge family pew, with Fauntleroy at his side.

There were many loiterers in the churchyard, and many lingerers in the lane that morning. There were groups at the gates and in the porch, and there had been much discussion as to whether my lord would really appear or not. When this discussion was at its height, one good woman suddenly uttered an exclamation.

"Eh," she said, "that must be the mother, pretty young thing." All who heard turned and looked at the slender figure in black coming up the path. The veil was thrown back from her face and they could see how fair and sweet it was, and how the bright hair curled as a child's under the little widow's cap.

She was not thinking of the people about; she was thinking of Cedric, and of his visits to her, and his joy over his new pony, on which he had actually ridden to her door the day before, sitting very straight and looking very proud and happy. But soon she could not help being attracted by the fact that she was being looked at and that her arrival had created some sort of sensation. She first noticed it because an old woman in a red cloak made a bobbing courtesy to her, and then another did the same thing and said, "God bless you, my lady!" and one man after another took off his hat as she passed. For a moment she did not understand, and then she realized that it was because she was little Lord Fauntleroy's mother that they did so, and she flushed rather shyly and smiled and bowed too, and said, "Thank you," in a gentle voice to the old woman who had blessed her. To a person who had always lived in a bustling, crowded American city this simple deference was very novel, and at first just a little embarrassing; but after all, she could not help liking and being touched by the friendly warm-heartedness of which it seemed to speak. She had scarcely passed through the stone porch into the church before the great event of the day happened. The carriage from the Castle, with its handsome horses and tall liveried servants, bowled around the corner and down the green lane.

"Here they come!" went from one looker-on to another.

And then the carriage drew up, and Thomas stepped down and opened the door, and a little boy, dressed in black velvet, and with a splendid mop of bright waving hair, jumped out.

Every man, woman, and child looked curiously upon him.

"He's the Captain over again!" said those of the on-lookers who remembered his father. "He's the Captain's self, to the life!"

He stood there in the sunlight looking up at the Earl, as Thomas helped that nobleman out, with the most affectionate interest that could be imagined. The instant he could help, he put out his hand and offered his shoulder as if he had been seven feet high. It was plain enough to every one that however it might be with other people, the Earl of Dorincourt struck no terror into the breast of his grandson.

"Just lean on me," they heard him say. "How glad the people are to see you, and how well they all seem to know you!"

"Take off your cap, Fauntleroy," said the Earl. "They are bowing to you."

"To me!" cried Fauntleroy, whipping off his cap in a moment, baring his bright head to the crowd and turning shining, puzzled eyes on them as he tried to bow to every one at once.

"God bless your lordship!" said the courtesying, red-cloaked old woman who had spoken to his mother; "long life to you!"

"Thank you, ma'am," said Fauntleroy. And then they went into the church, and were looked at there, on their way up the aisle to the square, red-cushioned and curtained pew. When Fauntleroy was fairly seated, he made two discoveries which pleased him: the first that, across the church where he could look at her, his mother sat and smiled at him; the second, that at one end of the pew, against the wall, knelt two quaint figures carven in stone, facing each other as they kneeled on either side of a pillar supporting two stone missals, their pointed hands folded as if in prayer, their dress very antique and strange. On the tablet by them was written something of which he could only read the curious words:

"Here lyeth ye bodye of Gregorye Arthure Fyrst Earle of Dorincourt Allsoe of Alisone Hildegarde hys wyfe."

"May I whisper?" inquired his lordship, devoured by curiousity.

"What is it?" said his grandfather.

"Who are they?"

"Some of your ancestors," answered the Earl, "who lived a few hundred years ago."

"Perhaps," said Lord Fauntleroy, regarding them with respect,"perhaps I got my spelling from them." And then he proceeded to find his place in the church service. When the music began, he stood up and looked across at his mother, smiling. He was very fond of music, and his mother and he often sang together, so he joined in with the rest, his pure, sweet, high voice rising as clear as the song of a bird. He quite forgot himself in his pleasure in it. The Earl forgot himself a little too, as he sat in his curtainshielded corner of the pew and watched the boy. Cedric stood with the big psalter open in his hands, singing with all his childish might, his face a little uplifted, happily; and as he sang, a long ray of sunshine crept in and, slanting through a golden pane of a stained glass window, brightened the falling hair about his young head. His mother, as she looked at him across the church, felt a thrill pass through her heart, and a prayer rose in it too,—a prayer that the pure, simple happiness of his childish soul might last, and that the strange, great fortune which had fallen to him might bring no wrong or evil with it. There were many soft, anxious thoughts in her tender heart in those new days.

"Oh, Ceddie!" she had said to him the evening before, as she hung over him in saying good-night, before he went away; "oh, Ceddie, dear, I wish for your sake I was very clever and could say a great many wise things! But only be good, dear, only be brave, only be kind and true always, and then you will never hurt any one, so long as you live, and you may help many, and the big world may be better because my little child was born. And that is best of all, Ceddie,—it is better than everything else, that the world should be a little better because a man has lived—even ever so little better, dearest."

And on his return to the Castle, Fauntleroy had repeated her words to his grandfather.

"And I thought about you when she said that," he ended; "and I told her that was the way the world was because you had lived, and I was going to try if I could be like you."

"And what did she say to that?" asked his lordship, a trifle uneasily.

"She said that was right, and we must always look for good in people and try to be like it."

Perhaps it was this the old man remembered as he glanced through the divided folds of the red curtain of his pew. Many times he looked over the people's heads to where his son's wife sat alone, and he saw the fair face the unforgiven dead had loved, and the eyes which were so like those of the child at his side; but what his thoughts were, and whether they were hard and bitter, or softened a little, it would have been hard to discover.

As they came out of church, many of those who had attended the service stood waiting to see them pass. As they neared the gate, a man who stood with his hat in his hand made a step forward and then hesitated. He was a middle-aged farmer, with a careworn face.

"Well, Higgins," said the Earl.

Fauntleroy turned quickly to look at him.

"Oh!" he exclaimed, "is it Mr. Higgins?"

"Yes," answered the Earl dryly; "and I suppose he came to take a look at his new landlord."

"Yes, my lord," said the man, his sunburned face reddening. "Mr. Newick told me his young lordship was kind enough to speak for me, and I thought I'd like to say a word of thanks, if I might be allowed."

Perhaps he felt some wonder when he saw what a little fellow it was who had innocently done so much for him, and who stood there looking up just as one of his own less fortunate children might have done—apparently not realizing his own importance in the least.

"I've a great deal to thank your lordship for," he said; "a great deal. I—"

"Oh," said Fauntleroy; "I only wrote the letter. It was my grandfather who did it. But you know how he is about always being good to everybody. Is Mrs. Higgins well now?"

Higgins looked a trifle taken aback. He also was somewhat startled at hearing his noble landlord presented in the character of a benevolent being, full of engaging qualities.

"I—well, yes, your lordship," he stammered, "the missus is better since the trouble was took off her mind. It was worrying broke her down."

"I'm glad of that," said Fauntleroy. "My grandfather was very sorry about your children having the scarlet fever, and so was I. He has had children himself. I'm his son's little boy, you know."

Higgins was on the verge of being panic-stricken. He felt it would be the safer and more discreet plan not to look at the Earl, as it had been well known that his fatherly affection for his sons had been such that he had seen them about twice a year, and that when they had been ill, he had promptly departed for London, because he would not be bored with doctors and nurses. It was a little trying, therefore, to his lordship's nerves to be told, while he looked on, his eyes gleaming from under his shaggy eyebrows, that he felt an interest in scarlet fever.

"You see, Higgins," broke in the Earl with a fine grim smile, "you people have been mistaken in me. Lord Fauntleroy understands me. When you want reliable information on the subject of my character, apply to him. Get into the carriage, Fauntleroy."

And Fauntleroy jumped in, and the carriage rolled away down the green lane, and even when it turned the corner into the high road, the Earl was still grimly smiling.





Chapter 8　Learning to Ride


Lord Dorincourt had occasion to wear his grim smile many a time as the days passed by. Indeed, as his acquaintance with his grandson progressed, he wore the smile so often that there were moments when it almost lost its grimness. There is no denying that before Lord Fauntleroy had appeared on the scene, the old man had been growing very tired of his loneliness and his gout and his seventy years. After so long a life of excitement and amusement, it was not agreeable to sit alone even in the most splendid room, with one foot on a gout-stool, and with no other diversion than flying into a rage, and shouting at a frightened footman who hated the sight of him. The old Earl was too clever a man not to know perfectly well that his servants detested him, and that even if he had visitors, they did not come for love of him—though some found a sort of amusement in his sharp, sarcastic talk, which spared no one. So long as he had been strong and well, he had gone from one place to another, pretending to amuse himself, though he had not really enjoyed it; and when his health began to fail, he felt tired of everything and shut himself up at Dorincourt, with his gout and his newspapers and his books. But he could not read all the time, and he became more and more "bored," as he called it. He hated the long nights and days, and he grew more and more savage and irritable. And then Fauntleroy came; and when the Earl saw him, fortunately for the little fellow, the secret pride of the grandfather was gratified at the outset. If Cedric had been a less handsome little fellow, the old man might have taken so strong a dislike to him that he would not have given himself the chance to see his grandson's finer qualities. But he chose to think that Cedric's beauty and fearless spirit were the results of the Dorincourt blood and a credit to the Dorincourt rank. And then when he heard the lad talk, and saw what a well-bred little fellow he was, notwithstanding his boyish ignorance of all that his new position meant, the old Earl liked his grandson more, and actually began to find himself rather entertained. It had amused him to give into those childish hands the power to bestow a benefit on poor Higgins. My lord cared nothing for poor Higgins, but it pleased him a little to think that his grandson would be talked about by the country people and would begin to be popular with the tenantry, even in his childhood. Then it had gratified him to drive to church with Cedric and to see the excitement and interest caused by the arrival. He knew how the people would speak of the beauty of the little lad; of his fine, strong, straight body; of his erect bearing, his handsome face, and his bright hair, and how they would say (as the Earl had heard one woman exclaim to another) that the boy was "every inch a lord." My lord of Dorincourt was an arrogant old man, proud of his name, proud of his rank, and therefore proud to show the world that at last the House of Dorincourt had an heir who was worthy of the position he was to fill.

The morning the new pony had been tried, the Earl had been so pleased that he had almost forgotten his gout. When the groom had brought out the pretty creature, which arched its brown, glossy neck and tossed its fine head in the sun, the Earl had sat at the open window of the library and had looked on while Fauntleroy took his first riding lesson. He wondered if the boy would show signs of timidity. It was not a very small pony, and he had often seen children lose courage in making their first essay at riding.

Fauntleroy mounted in great delight. He had never been on a pony before, and he was in the highest spirits. Wilkins, the groom, led the animal by the bridle up and down before the library window.

"He's a well plucked un, he is," Wilkins remarked in the stable afterward with many grins. "It weren't no trouble to put HIM up. An' a old un wouldn't ha' sat any straighter when he WERE up. He ses—ses he to me, 'Wilkins,' he ses, 'am I sitting up straight? They sit up straight at the circus,' ses he. An' I ses, 'As straight as a arrer, your lordship!'—an' he laughs, as pleased as could be, an' he ses, 'That's right,' he ses, 'you tell me if I don't sit up straight, Wilkins!'"

But sitting up straight and being led at a walk were not altogether and completely satisfactory. After a few minutes, Fauntleroy spoke to his grandfather—watching him from the window:

"Can't I go by myself?" he asked; "and can't I go faster? The boy on Fifth Avenue used to trot and canter!"

"Do you think you could trot and canter?" said the Earl.

"I should like to try," answered Fauntleroy.

His lordship made a sign to Wilkins, who at the signal brought up his own horse and mounted it and took Fauntleroy's pony by the leading-rein.

"Now," said the Earl, "let him trot."

The next few minutes were rather exciting to the small equestrian. He found that trotting was not so easy as walking, and the faster the pony trotted, the less easy it was.

"It j-jolts a g-goo-good deal—do-doesn't it?" he said to Wilkins."Ddoes it j-jolt y-you?"

"No, my lord," answered Wilkins. "You'll get used to it in time. Rise in your stirrups."

"I'm ri-rising all the t-time," said Fauntleroy.

He was both rising and falling rather uncomfortably and with many shakes and bounces. He was out of breath and his face grew red, but he held on with all his might, and sat as straight as he could. The Earl could see that from his window. When the riders came back within speaking distance, after they had been hidden by the trees a few minutes, Fauntleroy's hat was off, his cheeks were like poppies, and his lips were set, but he was still trotting manfully.

"Stop a minute!" said his grandfather. "Where's your hat?"

Wilkins touched his. "It fell off, your lordship," he said, with evident enjoyment. "Wouldn't let me stop to pick it up, my lord."

"Not much afraid, is he?" asked the Earl dryly.

"Him, your lordship!" exclaimed Wilkins. "I shouldn't say as he knowed what it meant. I've taught young gen'lemen to ride afore, an' I never see one stick on more determinder."

"Tired?" said the Earl to Fauntleroy. "Want to get off?"

"It jolts you more than you think it will," admitted his young lordship frankly. "And it tires you a little, too; but I don't want to get off. I want to learn how. As soon as I've got my breath I want to go back for the hat."

The cleverest person in the world, if he had undertaken to teach Fauntleroy how to please the old man who watched him, could not have taught him anything which would have succeeded better. As the pony trotted off again toward the avenue, a faint color crept up in the fierce old face, and the eyes, under the shaggy brows, gleamed with a pleasure such as his lordship had scarcely expected to know again. And he sat and watched quite eagerly until the sound of the horses' hoofs returned. When they did come, which was after some time, they came at a faster pace. Fauntleroy's hat was still off; Wilkins was carrying it for him; his cheeks were redder than before, and his hair was flying about his ears, but he came at quite a brisk canter.

"There!" he panted, as they drew up, "I c-cantered. I didn't do it as well as the boy on Fifth Avenue, but I did it, and I staid on!"

He and Wilkins and the pony were close friends after that. Scarcely a day passed in which the country people did not see them out together, cantering gayly on the highroad or through the green lanes. The children in the cottages would run to the door to look at the proud little brown pony with the gallant little figure sitting so straight in the saddle, and the young lord would snatch off his cap and swing it at them, and shout, "Hullo! Good-morning!" in a very unlordly manner, though with great heartiness. Sometimes he would stop and talk with the children, and once Wilkins came back to the castle with a story of how Fauntleroy had insisted on dismounting near the village school, so that a boy who was lame and tired might ride home on his pony.

"An' I'm blessed," said Wilkins, in telling the story at the stables,—"I'm blessed if he'd hear of amything else! He wouldn't let me get down, because he said the boy mightn't feel comfortable on a big horse. An' ses he, 'Wilkins,' ses he, 'that boy's lame and I'm not, and I want to talk to him, too.' And up the lad has to get, and my lord trudges alongside of him with his hands in his pockets, and his cap on the back of his head, a-whistling and talking as easy as you please! And when we come to the cottage, an' the boy's mother come out all in a taking to see what's up, he whips off his cap an' ses he, 'I've brought your son home, ma'am,' ses he, 'because his leg hurt him, and I don't think that stick is enough for him to lean on; and I'm going to ask my grandfather to have a pair of crutches made for him.' An' I'm blessed if the woman wasn't struck all of a help, as well she might be! I thought I should 'a' hex-plodid, myself!"

When the Earl heard the story he was not angry, as Wilkins had been half afraid that he would be; on the contrary, he laughed outright, and called Fauntleroy up to him, and made him tell all about the matter from beginning to end, and then he laughed again. And actually, a few days later, the Dorincourt carriage stopped in the green lane before the cottage where the lame boy lived, and Fauntleroy jumped out and walked up to the door, carrying a pair of strong, light, new crutches shouldered like a gun, and presented them to Mrs. Hartle (the lame boy's name was Hartle) with these words: "My grandfather's compliments, and if you please, these are for your boy, and we hope he will get better."

"I said your compliments," he explained to the Earl when he returned to the carriage. "You didn't tell me to, but I thought perhaps you forgot. That was right, wasn't it?"

And the Earl laughed again, and did not say it was not. In fact, the two were becoming more intimate every day, and every day Fauntleroy's faith in his lordship's benevolence and virtue increased. He had no doubt whatever that his grandfather was the most amiable and generous of elderly gentlemen. Certainly, he himself found his wishes gratified almost before they were uttered; and such gifts and pleasures were lavished upon him, that he was sometimes almost bewildered by his own possessions. Apparently, he was to have everything he wanted, and to do everything he wished to do. And thought this would certainly not have been a very wise plan to pursue with all small boys, his young lordship bore it amazingly well. Perhaps, notwithstanding his sweet nature, he might have been somewhat spoiled by it, if it had not been for the hours he spent with his mother at Court Lodge. That "best friend" of his watch over him ever closely and tenderly. The two had many long talks together, and he never went back to the Castle with her kisses on his cheeks without carrying in his heart some simple, pure words worth remembering.

There was one thing, it is true, which puzzled the little fellow very much. He thought over the mystery of it much oftener than any one supposed; even his mother did not know how often he pondered on it; the Earl for a long time never suspected that he did so at all. But, being quick to observe, the little boy could not help wondering why it was that his mother and grandfather never seemed to meet. He had noticed that they never did meet. When the Dorincourt carriage stopped at Court Lodge, the Earl ever alighted, and on the rare occasions of his lordship's going to church, Fauntleroy was always left to speak to his mother in the porch alone, or perhaps to go home with her. And yet, every day, fruit and flowers were sent to Court Lodge from the hot-houses at the Castle. But the one virtuous action of the Earl's which had set him upon the pinnacle of perfection in Cedric's eyes, was what he had done soon after that first Sunday when Mrs. Errol had walked home from church unattented. About a week later, when Cedric was going one day to visit his mother, he found at the door, instead of the large carriage and prancing pair, a pretty little brougham and a handsome bay horse.

"That is a present from you to your mother," the Earl said abruptly. "She can not go walking about the country. She needs a carriage. The man who drives will take charge of it. It is a present from YOU."

Fauntleroy's delight could but feebly express itself. He could scarcely contain himself until he reached the lodge. His mother was gathering roses in the garden. He flung himself out of the little brougham and flew to her.

"Dearest!" he cried, "could you believe it? This is yours! He says it is a present from me. It is your own carriage to drive everywhere in!"

He was so happy that she did not know what to say. She could not have borne to spoil his pleasure by refusing to accept the gift even though it came from the man who chose to consider himself her enemy. She was obliged to step into the carriage, roses and all, and let herself be taken to drive, while Fauntleroy told her stories of his grandfather's goodness and amiability. They were such innocent stories that sometimes she could not help laughing a little, and then she would draw her little boy closer to her side and kiss him, feeling glad that he could see only good in the old man, who had so few friends.

The very next day after that, Fauntleroy wrote to Mr. Hobbs. He wrote quite a long letter, and after the first copy was written, he brought it to his grandfather to be inspected.

"Because," he said, "it's so uncertain about the spelling. And if you'll tell me the mistakes, I'll write it out again."

This was what he had written:

"My dear mr hobbs i want to tell you about my granfarther he is the best earl you ever new it is a mistake about earls being tirents he is not a tirent at all i wish you new him you would be good friends i am sure you would he has the gout in his foot and is a grate sufrer but he is so pashent i love him more every day becaus no one could help loving an earl like that who is kind to every one in this world i wish you could talk to him he knows everything in the world you can ask him any question but he has never plaid base ball he has given me a pony and a cart and my mamma a bewtifle cariage and I have three rooms and toys of all kinds it would serprise you you would like the castle and the park it is such a large castle you could lose yourself wilkins tells me wilkins is my groom he says there is a dungon under the castle it is so pretty everything in the park would serprise you there are such big trees and there are deers and rabbits and games flying about in the cover my granfarther is very rich but he is not proud and orty as you thought earls always were i like to be with him the people are so polite and kind they take of their hats to you and the women make curtsies and sometimes say god bless you i can ride now but at first it shook me when i troted my granfarther let a poor man stay on his farm when he could not pay his rent and mrs mellon went to take wine and things to his sick children i should like to see you and i wish dearest could live at the castle but i am very happy when i dont miss her too much and i love my granfarther every one does plees write soon.

"your afechshnet old frend."

"Cedric Errol."

"ps no one is in the dungon my granfarfher never had any one langwishin in there."

"ps he is such a good earl he reminds me of you he is a unerversle favrit"

"Do you miss your mother very much?" asked the Earl when he had finished reading this.

"Yes," said Fauntleroy, "I miss her all the time."

He went and stood before the Earl and put his hand on his knee, looking up at him.

"YOU don't miss her, do you?" he said.

"I don't know her," answered his lordship rather crustily.

"I know that," said Fauntleroy, "and that's what makes me wonder. She told me not to ask you any questions, and—and I won't, but sometimes I can't help thinking, you know, and it makes me all puzzled. But I'm not going to ask any questions. And when I miss her very much, I go and look out of my window to where I see her light shine for me every night through an open place in the trees. It is a long way off, but she puts it in her window as soon as it is dark, and I can see it twinkle far away, and I know what it says."

"What does it say?" asked my lord.

"It says, 'Good-night, God keep you all the night!'—just what she used to say when we were together. Every night she used to say that to me, and every morning she said, 'God bless you all the day!' So you see I am quite safe all the time—"

"Quite, I have no doubt," said his lordship dryly. And he drew down his beetling eyebrows and looked at the little boy so fixedly and so long that Fauntleroy wondered what he could be thinking of.





Chapter 9　The Poor Cottages


The fact was, his lordship the Earl of Dorincourt thought in those days, of many things of which he had never thought before, and all his thoughts were in one way or another connected with his grandson. His pride was the strongest part of his nature, and the boy gratified it at every point. Through this pride he began to find a new interest in life. He began to take pleasure in showing his heir to the world. The world had known of his disappointment in his sons; so there was an agreeable touch of triumph in exhibiting this new Lord Fauntleroy, who could disappoint no one. He wished the child to appreciate his own power and to understand the splendor of his position; he wished that others should realize it too. He made plans for his future.

Sometimes in secret he actually found himself wishing that his own past life had been a better one, and that there had been less in it that this pure, childish heart would shrink from if it knew the truth. It was not agreeable to think how the beautiful, innocent face would look if its owner should be made by any chance to understand that his grandfather had been called for many a year "the wicked Earl of Dorincourt." The thought even made him feel a trifle nervous. He did not wish the boy to find it out. Sometimes in this new interest he forgot his gout, and after a while his doctor was surprised to find his noble patient's health growing better than he had expected it ever would be again. Perhaps the Earl grew better because the time did not pass so slowly for him, and he had something to think of beside his pains and infirmities.

One fine morning, people were amazed to see little Lord Fauntleroy riding his pony with another companion than Wilkins. This new companion rode a tall, powerful gray horse, and was no other than the Earl himself. It was, in fact, Fauntleroy who had suggested this plan. As he had been on the point of mounting his pony, he had said rather wistfully to his grandfather:

"I wish you were going with me. When I go away I feel lonely because you are left all by yourself in such a big castle. I wish you could ride too."

And the greatest excitement had been aroused in the stables a few minutes later by the arrival of an order that Selim was to be saddled for the Earl. After that, Selim was saddled almost every day; and the people became accustomed to the sight of the tall gray horse carrying the tall gray old man, with his handsome, fierce, eagle face, by the side of the brown pony which bore little Lord Fauntleroy. And in their rides together through the green lanes and pretty country roads, the two riders became more intimate than ever. And gradually the old man heard a great deal about"Dearest" and her life. As Fauntleroy trotted by the big horse he chatted gayly. There could not well have been a brighter little comrade, his nature was so happy. It was he who talked the most. The Earl often was silent, listening and watching the joyous, glowing face. Sometimes he would tell his young companion to set the pony off at a gallop, and when the little fellow dashed off, sitting so straight and fearless, he would watch him with a gleam of pride and pleasure in his eyes; and when, after such a dash, Fauntleroy came back waving his cap with a laughing shout, he always felt that he and his grandfather were very good friends indeed.

One thing that the Earl discovered was that his son's wife did not lead an idle life. It was not long before he learned that the poor people knew her very well indeed. When there was sickness or sorrow or poverty in any house, the little brougham often stood before the door.

"Do you know," said Fauntleroy once, "they all say, 'God bless you!' when they see her, and the children are glad. There are some who go to her house to be taught to sew. She says she feels so rich now that she wants to help the poor ones."

It had not displeased the Earl to find that the mother of his heir had a beautiful young face and looked as much like a lady as if she had been a duchess; and in one way it did not displease him to know that she was popular and beloved by the poor. And yet he was often conscious of a hard, jealous pang when he saw how she filled her child's heart and how the boy clung to her as his best beloved. The old man would have desired to stand first himself and have no rival.

That same morning he drew up his horse on an elevated point of the moor over which they rode, and made a gesture with his whip, over the broad, beautiful landscape spread before them.

"Do you know that all that land belongs to me?" he said to Fauntleroy.

"Does it?" answered Fauntleroy. "How much it is to belong to one person, and how beautiful!"

"Do you know that some day it will all belong to you—that and a great deal more?"

"To me!" exclaimed Fauntleroy in rather an awe-stricken voice. "When?"

"When I am dead," his grandfather answered.

"Then I don't want it," said Fauntleroy; "I want you to live always."

"That's kind," answered the Earl in his dry way; "nevertheless, some day it will all be yours—some day you will be the Earl of Dorincourt."

Little Lord Fauntleroy sat very still in his saddle for a few moments. He looked over the broad moors, the green farms, the beautiful copses, the cottages in the lanes, the pretty village, and over the trees to where the turrets of the great castle rose, gray and stately. Then he gave a queer little sigh.

"What are you thinking of?" asked the Earl.

"I am thinking," replied Fauntleroy, "what a little boy I am! and of what Dearest said to me."

"What was it?" inquired the Earl.

"She said that perhaps it was not so easy to be very rich; that if any one had so many things always, one might sometimes forget that every one else was not so fortunate, and that one who is rich should always be careful and try to remember. I was talking to her about how good you were, and she said that was such a good thing, because an earl had so much power, and if he cared only about his own pleasure and never thought about the people who lived on his lands, they might have trouble that he could help—and there were so many people, and it would be such a hard thing. And I was just looking at all those houses, and thinking how I should have to find out about the people, when I was an earl. How did you find out about them?"

As his lordship's knowledge of his tenantry consisted in finding out which of them paid their rent promptly, and in turning out those who did not, this was rather a hard question. "Newick finds out for me," he said, and he pulled his great gray mustache, and looked at his small questioner rather uneasily. "We will go home now," he added; "and when you are an earl, see to it that you are a better earl than I have been!"

He was very silent as they rode home. He felt it to be almost incredible that he who had never really loved any one in his life, should find himself growing so fond of this little fellow,—as without doubt he was. At first he had only been pleased and proud of Cedric's beauty and bravery, but there was something more than pride in his feeling now. He laughed a grim, dry laugh all to himself sometimes, when he thought how he liked to have the boy near him, how he liked to hear his voice, and how in secret he really wished to be liked and thought well of by his small grandson.

"I'm an old fellow in my dotage, and I have nothing else to think of," he would say to himself; and yet he knew it was not that altogether. And if he had allowed himself to admit the truth, he would perhaps have found himself obliged to own that the very things which attracted him, in spite of himself, were the qualities he had never possessed—the frank, true, kindly nature, the affectionate trustfulness which could never think evil.

It was only about a week after that ride when, after a visit to his mother, Fauntleroy came into the library with a troubled, thoughtful face. He sat down in that high-backed chair in which he had sat on the evening of his arrival, and for a while he looked at the embers on the hearth. The Earl watched him in silence, wondering what was coming. It was evident that Cedric had something on his mind. At last he looked up. "Does Newick know all about the people?" he asked.

"It is his business to know about them," said his lordship. "Been neglecting it—has he?"

Contradictory as it may seem, there was nothing which entertained and edified him more than the little fellow's interest in his tenantry. He had never taken any interest in them himself, but it pleased him well enough that, with all his childish habits of thought and in the midst of all his childish amusements and high spirits, there should be such a quaint seriousness working in the curly head.

"There is a place," said Fauntleroy, looking up at him with wide-open, horror-stricken eye—"Dearest has seen it; it is at the other end of the village. The houses are close together, and almost falling down; you can scarcely breathe; and the people are so poor, and everything is dreadful! Often they have fever, and the children die; and it makes them wicked to live like that, and be so poor and miserable! It is worse than Michael and Bridget! The rain comes in at the roof! Dearest went to see a poor woman who lived there. She would not let me come near her until she had changed all her things. The tears ran down her cheeks when she told me about it!"

The tears had come into his own eyes, but he smiled through them.

"I told her you didn't know, and I would tell you," he said. He jumped down and came and leaned against the Earl's chair. "You can make it all right," he said, "just as you made it all right for Higgins. You always make it all right for everybody. I told her you would, and that Newick must have forgotten to tell you."

The Earl looked down at the hand on his knee. Newick had not forgotten to tell him; in fact, Newick had spoken to him more than once of the desperate condition of the end of the village known as Earl's Court. He knew all about the tumble-down, miserable cottages, and the bad drainage, and the damp walls and broken windows and leaking roofs, and all about the poverty, the fever, and the misery. Mr. Mordaunt had painted it all to him in the strongest words he could use, and his lordship had used violent language in response; and, when his gout had been at the worst, he said that the sooner the people of Earl's Court died and were buried by the parish the better it would be,—and there was an end of the matter. And yet, as he looked at the small hand on his knee, and from the small hand to the honest, earnest, frank-eyed face, he was actually a little ashamed both of Earl's Court and himself.

"What!" he said; "you want to make a builder of model cottages of me, do you?" And he positively put his own hand upon the childish one and stroked it.

"Those must be pulled down," said Fauntleroy, with great eagerness. "Dearest says so. Let us—let us go and have them pulled down to-morrow. The people will be so glad when they see you! They'll know you have come to help them!" And his eyes shone like stars in his glowing face.

The Earl rose from his chair and put his hand on the child's shoulder. "Let us go out and take our walk on the terrace," he said, with a short laugh; "and we can talk it over."

And though he laughed two or three times again, as they walked to and fro on the broad stone terrace, where they walked together almost every fine evening, he seemed to be thinking of something which did not displease him, and still he kept his hand on his small companion's shoulder.





Chapter 10　The Earl Alarmed


The truth was that Mrs. Errol had found a great many sad things in the course of her work among the poor of the little village that appeared so picturesque when it was seen from the moor-sides. Everything was not as picturesque, when seen near by, as it looked from a distance. She had found idleness and poverty and ignorance where there should have been comfort and industry. And she had discovered, after a while, that Erleboro was considered to be the worst village in that part of the country. Mr. Mordaunt had told her a great many of his difficulties and discouragements, and she had found out a great deal by herself. The agents who had managed the property had always been chosen to please the Earl, and had cared nothing for the degradation and wretchedness of the poor tenants. Many things, therefore, had been neglected which should have been attended to, and matters had gone from bad to worse.

As to Earl's Court, it was a disgrace, with its dilapidated houses and miserable, careless, sickly people. When first Mrs. Errol went to the place, it made her shudder. Such ugliness and slovenliness and want seemed worse in a country place than in a city. It seemed as if there it might be helped. And as she looked at the squalid, uncared-for children growing up in the midst of vice and brutal indifference, she thought of her own little boy spending his days in the great, splendid castle, guarded and served like a young prince, having no wish ungratified, and knowing nothing but luxury and ease and beauty. And a bold thought came in her wise little mother-heart. Gradually she had begun to see, as had others, that it had been her boy's good fortune to please the Earl very much, and that he would scarcely be likely to be denied anything for which he expressed a desire.

"The Earl would give him anything," she said to Mr. Mordaunt. "He would indulge his every whim. Why should not that indulgence be used for the good of others? It is for me to see that this shall come to pass."

She knew she could trust the kind, childish heart; so she told the little fellow the story of Earl's Court, feeling sure that he would speak of it to his grandfather, and hoping that some good results would follow.

And strange as it appeared to every one, good results did follow.

The fact was that the strongest power to influence the Earl was his grandson's perfect confidence in him—the fact that Cedric always believed that his grandfather was going to do what was right and generous. He could not quite make up his mind to let him discover that he had no inclination to be generous at all, and that he wanted his own way on all occasions, whether it was right or wrong. It was such a novelty to be regarded with admiration as a benefactor of the entire human race, and the soul of nobility, that he did not enjoy the idea of looking into the affectionate brown eyes, and saying: "I am a violent, selfish old rascal; I never did a generous thing in my life, and I don't care about Earl's Court or the poor people"—or something which would amount to the same thing. He actually had learned to be fond enough of that small boy with the mop of yellow love-locks, to feel that he himself would prefer to be guilty of an amiable action now and then. And so—though he laughed at himself—after some reflection, he sent for Newick, and had quite a long interview with him on the subject of the Court, and it was decided that the wretched hovels should be pulled down and new houses should be built.

"It is Lord Fauntleroy who insists on it," he said dryly; "he thinks it will improve the property. You can tell the tenants that it's his idea." And he looked down at his small lordship, who was lying on the hearth-rug playing with Dougal. The great dog was the lad's constant companion, and followed him about everywhere, stalking solemnly after him when he walked, and trotting majestically behind when he rode or drove.

Of course, both the country people and the town people heard of the proposed improvement. At first, many of them would not believe it; but when a small army of workmen arrived and commenced pulling down the crazy, squalid cottages, people began to understand that little Lord Fauntleroy had done them a good turn again, and that through his innocent interference the scandal of Earl's Court had at last been removed. If he had only known how they talked about him and praised him everywhere, and prophesied great things for him when he grew up, how astonished he would have been! But he never suspected it. He lived his simple, happy, child life,—frolicking about in the park; chasing the rabbits to their burrows; lying under the trees on the grass, or on the rug in the library, reading wonderful books and talking to the Earl about them, and then telling the stories again to his mother; writing long letters to Dick and Mr. Hobbs, who responded in characteristic fashion; riding out at his grandfather's side, or with Wilkins as escort. As they rode through the market town, he used to see the people turn and look, and he noticed that as they lifted their hats their faces often brightened very much; but he thought it was all because his grandfather was with him.

"They are so fond of you," he once said, looking up at his lordship with a bright smile. "Do you see how glad they are when they see you? I hope they will some day be as fond of me. It must be nice to have EVERYbody like you." And he felt quite proud to be the grandson of so greatly admired and beloved an individual.

When the cottages were being built, the lad and his grandfather used to ride over to Earl's Court together to look at them, and Fauntleroy was full of interest. He would dismount from his pony and go and make acquaintance with the workmen, asking them questions about building and bricklaying, and telling them things about America. After two or three such conversations, he was able to enlighten the Earl on the subject of brick-making, as they rode home.

"I always like to know about things like those," he said, "because you never know what you are coming to."

When he left them, the workmen used to talk him over among themselves, and laugh at his odd, innocent speeches; but they liked him, and liked to see him stand among them, talking away, with his hands in his pockets, his hat pushed back on his curls, and his small face full of eagerness. "He's a rare un," they used to say. "An' a noice little outspoken chap, too. Not much o'th' bad stock in him." And they would go home and tell their wives about him, and the women would tell each other, and so it came about that almost every one talked of, or knew some story of, little Lord Fauntleroy; and gradually almost every one knew that the "wicked Earl" had found something he cared for at last—something which had touched and even warmed his hard, bitter old heart.

But no one knew quite how much it had been warmed, and how day by day the old man found himself caring more and more for the child, who was the only creature that had ever trusted him. He found himself looking forward to the time when Cedric would be a young man, strong and beautiful, with life all before him, but having still that kind heart and the power to make friends everywhere, and the Earl wondered what the lad would do, and how he would use his gifts. Often as he watched the little fellow lying upon the hearth, conning some big book, the light shining on the bright young head, his old eyes would gleam and his cheek would flush.

"The boy can do anything," he would say to himself, "anything!"

He never spoke to any one else of his feeling for Cedric; when he spoke of him to others it was always with the same grim smile. But Fauntleroy soon knew that his grandfather loved him and always liked him to be near—near to his chair if they were in the library, opposite to him at table, or by his side when he rode or drove or took his evening walk on the broad terrace.

"Do you remember," Cedric said once, looking up from his book as he lay on the rug, "do you remember what I said to you that first night about our being good companions? I don't think any people could be better companions than we are, do you?"

"We are pretty good companions, I should say," replied his lordship. "Come here."

Fauntleroy scrambled up and went to him.

"Is there anything you want," the Earl asked; "anything you have not?"

The little fellow's brown eyes fixed themselves on his grandfather with a rather wistful look.

"Only one thing," he answered.

"What is that?" inquired the Earl.

Fauntleroy was silent a second. He had not thought matters over to himself so long for nothing.

"What is it?" my lord repeated.

Fauntleroy answered.

"It is Dearest," he said.

The old Earl winced a little.

"But you see her almost every day," he said. "Is not that enough?"

"I used to see her all the time," said Fauntleroy. "She used to kiss me when I went to sleep at night, and in the morning she was always there, and we could tell each other things without waiting."

The old eyes and the young ones looked into each other through a moment of silence. Then the Earl knitted his brows.

"Do you NEVER forget about your mother?" he said.

"No," answered Fauntleroy, "never; and she never forgets about me. I shouldn't forget about YOU, you know, if I didn't live with you. I should think about you all the more."

"Upon my word," said the Earl, after looking at him a moment longer, "I believe you would!"

The jealous pang that came when the boy spoke so of his mother seemed even stronger than it had been before; it was stronger because of this old man's increasing affection for the boy.

But it was not long before he had other pangs, so much harder to face that he almost forgot, for the time, he had ever hated his son's wife at all. And in a strange and startling way it happened. One evening, just before the Earl's Court cottages were completed, there was a grand dinner party at Dorincourt. There had not been such a party at the Castle for a long time. A few days before it took place, Sir Harry Lorridaile and Lady Lorridaile, who was the Earl's only sister, actually came for a visit—a thing which caused the greatest excitement in the village and set Mrs. Dibble's shop-bell tinkling madly again, because it was well known that Lady Lorridaile had only been to Dorincourt once since her marriage, thirty-five years before. She was a handsome old lady with white curls and dimpled, peachy cheeks, and she was as good as gold, but she had never approved of her brother any more than did the rest of the world, and having a strong will of her own and not being at all afraid to speak her mind frankly, she had, after several lively quarrels with his lordship, seen very little of him since her young days.

She had heard a great deal of him that was not pleasant through the years in which they had been separated. She had heard about his neglect of his wife, and of the poor lady's death; and of his indifference to his children; and of the two weak, vicious, unprepossessing elder boys who had been no credit to him or to any one else. Those two elder sons, Bevis and Maurice, she had never seen; but once there had come to Lorridaile Park a tall, stalwart, beautiful young fellow about eighteen years old, who had told her that he was her nephew Cedric Errol, and that he had come to see her because he was passing near the place and wished to look at his Aunt Constantia of whom he had heard his mother speak. Lady Lorridaile's kind heart had warmed through and through at the sight of the young man, and she had made him stay with her a week, and petted him, and made much of him and admired him immensely. He was so sweettempered, light-hearted, spirited a lad, that when he went away, she had hoped to see him often again; but she never did, because the Earl had been in a bad humor when he went back to Dorincourt, and had forbidden him ever to go to Lorridaile Park again. But Lady Lorridaile had always remembered him tenderly, and though she feared he had made a rash marriage in America, she had been very angry when she heard how he had been cast off by his father and that no one really knew where or how he lived. At last there came a rumor of his death, and then Bevis had been thrown from his horse and killed, and Maurice had died in Rome of the fever; and soon after came the story of the American child who was to be found and brought home as Lord Fauntleroy.

"Probably to be ruined as the others were," she said to her husband, "unless his mother is good enough and has a will of her own to help her to take care of him."

But when she heard that Cedric's mother had been parted from him she was almost too indignant for words.

"It is disgraceful, Harry!" she said. "Fancy a child of that age being taken from his mother, and made the companion of a man like my brother! He will either be brutal to the boy or indulge him until he is a little monster. If I thought it would do any good to write—"

"It wouldn't, Constantia," said Sir Harry.

"I know it wouldn't," she answered. "I know his lordship the Earl of Dorincourt too well;—but it is outrageous."

Not only the poor people and farmers heard about little Lord Fauntleroy; others knew him. He was talked about so much and there were so many stories of him—of his beauty, his sweet temper, his popularity, and his growing influence over the Earl, his grandfather—that rumors of him reached the gentry at their country places and he was heard of in more than one county of England. People talked about him at the dinner tables, ladies pitied his young mother, and wondered if the boy were as handsome as he was said to be, and men who knew the Earl and his habits laughed heartily at the stories of the little fellow's belief in his lordship's amiability. Sir Thomas Asshe of Asshawe Hall, being in Erleboro one day, met the Earl and his grandson riding together, and stopped to shake hands with my lord and congratulate him on his change of looks and on his recovery from the gout. "And, d' ye know," he said, when he spoke of the incident afterward, "the old man looked as proud as a turkey-cock; and upon my word I don't wonder, for a handsomer, finer lad than his grandson I never saw! As straight as a dart, and sat his pony like a young trooper!"

And so by degrees Lady Lorridaile, too, heard of the child; she heard about Higgins and the lame boy, and the cottages at Earl's Court, and a score of other things, —and she began to wish to see the little fellow. And just as she was wondering how it might be brought about, to her utter astonishment, she received a letter from her brother inviting her to come with her husband to Dorincourt.

"It seems incredible!" she exclaimed. "I have heard it said that the child has worked miracles, and I begin to believe it. They say my brother adores the boy and can scarcely endure to have him out of sight. And he is so proud of him! Actually, I believe he wants to show him to us." And she accepted the invitation at once.

When she reached Dorincourt Castle with Sir Harry, it was late in the afternoon, and she went to her room at once before seeing her brother. Having dressed for dinner, she entered the drawing-room. The Earl was there standing near the fire and looking very tall and imposing; and at his side stood a little boy in black velvet, and a large Vandyke collar of rich lace—a little fellow whose round bright face was so handsome, and who turned upon her such beautiful, candid brown eyes, that she almost uttered an exclamation of pleasure and surprise at the sight.

As she shook hands with the Earl, she called him by the name she had not used since her girlhood.

"What, Molyneux!" she said, "is this the child?"

"Yes, Constantia," answered the Earl, "this is the boy. Fauntleroy, this is your grand-aunt, Lady Lorridaile."

"How do you do, Grand-Aunt?" said Fauntleroy.

Lady Lorridaile put her hand on his shoulders, and after looking down into his upraised face a few seconds, kissed him warmly.

"I am your Aunt Constantia," she said, "and I loved your poor papa, and you are very like him."

"It makes me glad when I am told I am like him," answered Fauntleroy, "because it seems as if every one liked him,—just like Dearest, eszackly,—Aunt Constantia" (adding the two words after a second's pause).

Lady Lorridaile was delighted. She bent and kissed him again, and from that moment they were warm friends.

"Well, Molyneux," she said aside to the Earl afterward, "it could not possibly be better than this!"

"I think not," answered his lordship dryly. "He is a fine little fellow. We are great friends. He believes me to be the most charming and sweettempered of philanthropists. I will confess to you, Constantia,—as you would find it out if I did not,—that I am in some slight danger of becoming rather an old fool about him."

"What does his mother think of you?" asked Lady Lorridaile, with her usual straightforwardness.

"I have not asked her," answered the Earl, slightly scowling.

"Well," said Lady Lorridaile, "I will be frank with you at the outset, Molyneux, and tell you I don't approve of your course, and that it is my intention to call on Mrs. Errol as soon as possible; so if you wish to quarrel with me, you had better mention it at once. What I hear of the young creature makes me quite sure that her child owes her everything. We were told even at Lorridaile Park that your poorer tenants adore her already."

"They adore HIM," said the Earl, nodding toward Fauntleroy. "As to Mrs. Errol, you'll find her a pretty little woman. I'm rather in debt to her for giving some of her beauty to the boy, and you can go to see her if you like. All I ask is that she will remain at Court Lodge and that you will not ask me to go and see her," and he scowled a little again.

"But he doesn't hate her as much as he used to, that is plain enough to me," her ladyship said to Sir Harry afterward. "And he is a changed man in a measure, and, incredible as it may seem, Harry, it is my opinion that he is being made into a human being, through nothing more nor less than his affection for that innocent, affectionate little fellow. Why, the child actually loves him—leans on his chair and against his knee. His own children would as soon have thought of nestling up to a tiger."

The very next day she went to call upon Mrs. Errol. When she returned, she said to her brother:

"Molyneux, she is the loveliest little woman I ever saw! She has a voice like a silver bell, and you may thank her for making the boy what he is. She has given him more than her beauty, and you make a great mistake in not persuading her to come and take charge of you. I shall invite her to Lorridaile."

"She'll not leave the boy," replied the Earl.

"I must have the boy too," said Lady Lorridaile, laughing.

But she knew Fauntleroy would not be given up to her, and each day she saw more clearly how closely those two had grown to each other, and how all the proud, grim old man's ambition and hope and love centered themselves in the child, and how the warm, innocent nature returned his affection with most perfect trust and good faith.

She knew, too, that the prime reason for the great dinner party was the Earl's secret desire to show the world his grandson and heir, and to let people see that the boy who had been so much spoken of and described was even a finer little specimen of boyhood than rumor had made him.

"Bevis and Maurice were such a bitter humiliation to him," she said to her husband. "Every one knew it. He actually hated them. His pride has full sway here." Perhaps there was not one person who accepted the invitation without feeling some curiosity about little Lord Fauntleroy, and wondering if he would be on view.

And when the time came he was on view.

"The lad has good manners," said the Earl. "He will be in no one's way. Children are usually idiots or bores,—mine were both,—but he can actually answer when he's spoken to, and be silent when he is not. He is never offensive."

But he was not allowed to be silent very long. Every one had something to say to him. The fact was they wished to make him talk. The ladies petted him and asked him questions, and the men asked him questions too, and joked with him, as the men on the steamer had done when he crossed the Atlantic. Fauntleroy did not quite understand why they laughed so sometimes when he answered them, but he was so used to seeing people amused when he was quite serious, that he did not mind. He thought the whole evening delightful. The magnificent rooms were so brilliant with lights, there were so many flowers, the gentlemen seemed so gay, and the ladies wore such beautiful, wonderful dresses, and such sparkling ornaments in their hair and on their necks. There was one young lady who, he heard them say, had just come down from London, where she had spent the "season"; and she was so charming that he could not keep his eyes from her. She was a rather tall young lady with a proud little head, and very soft dark hair, and large eyes the color of purple pansies, and the color on her cheeks and lips was like that of a rose. She was dressed in a beautiful white dress, and had pearls around her throat. There was one strange thing about this young lady. So many gentlemen stood near her, and seemed anxious to please her, that Fauntleroy thought she must be something like a princess. He was so much interested in her that without knowing it he drew nearer and nearer to her, and at last she turned and spoke to him.

"Come here, Lord Fauntleroy," she said, smiling; "and tell me why you look at me so."

"I was thinking how beautiful you are," his young lordship replied.

Then all the gentlemen laughed outright, and the young lady laughed a little too, and the rose color in her cheeks brightened.

"Ah, Fauntleroy," said one of the gentlemen who had laughed most heartily, "make the most of your time! When you are older you will not have the courage to say that."

"But nobody could help saying it," said Fauntleroy sweetly. "Could you help it? Don't YOU think she is pretty, too?"

"We are not allowed to say what we think," said the gentleman, while the rest laughed more than ever.

But the beautiful young lady—her name was Miss Vivian Herbert—put out her hand and drew Cedric to her side, looking prettier than before, if possible.

"Lord Fauntleroy shall say what he thinks," she said; "and I am much obliged to him. I am sure he thinks what he says." And she kissed him on his cheek.

"I think you are prettier than any one I ever saw," said Fauntleroy, looking at her with innocent, admiring eyes, "except Dearest. Of course, I couldn't think any one QUITE as pretty as Dearest. I think she is the prettiest person in the world."

"I am sure she is," said Miss Vivian Herbert. And she laughed and kissed his cheek again.

She kept him by her side a great part of the evening, and the group of which they were the center was very gay. He did not know how it happened, but before long he was telling them all about America, and the Republican Rally, and Mr. Hobbs and Dick, and in the end he proudly produced from his pocket Dick's parting gift,—the red silk handkerchief.

"I put it in my pocket to-night because it was a party," he said. "I thought Dick would like me to wear it at a party."

And queer as the big, flaming, spotted thing was, there was a serious, affectionate look in his eyes, which prevented his audience from laughing very much.

"You see, I like it," he said, "because Dick is my friend."

But though he was talked to so much, as the Earl had said, he was in no one's way. He could be quiet and listen when others talked, and so no one found him tiresome. A slight smile crossed more than one face when several times he went and stood near his grandfather's chair, or sat on a stool close to him, watching him and absorbing every word he uttered with the most charmed interest. Once he stood so near the chair's arm that his cheek touched the Earl's shoulder, and his lordship, detecting the general smile, smiled a little himself. He knew what the lookers-on were thinking, and he felt some secret amusement in their seeing what good friends he was with this youngster, who might have been expected to share the popular opinion of him.

Mr. Havisham had been expected to arrive in the afternoon, but, strange to say, he was late. Such a thing had really never been known to happen before during all the years in which he had been a visitor at Dorincourt Castle. He was so late that the guests were on the point of rising to go in to dinner when he arrived. When he approached his host, the Earl regarded him with amazement. He looked as if he had been hurried or agitated; his dry, keen old face was actually pale.

"I was detained," he said, in a low voice to the Earl, "by—an extraordinary event."

It was as unlike the methodic old lawyer to be agitated by anything as it was to be late, but it was evident that he had been disturbed. At dinner he ate scarcely anything, and two or three times, when he was spoken to, he started as if his thoughts were far away. At dessert, when Fauntleroy came in, he looked at him more than once, nervously and uneasily. Fauntleroy noted the look and wondered at it. He and Mr. Havisham were on friendly terms, and they usually exchanged smiles. The lawyer seemed to have forgotten to smile that evening.

The fact was, he forgot everything but the strange and painful news he knew he must tell the Earl before the night was over—the strange news which he knew would be so terrible a shock, and which would change the face of everything. As he looked about at the splendid rooms and the brilliant company, —at the people gathered together, he knew, more that they might see the bright-haired little fellow near the Earl's chair than for any other reason, —as he looked at the proud old man and at little Lord Fauntleroy smiling at his side, he really felt quite shaken, notwithstanding that he was a hardened old lawyer. What a blow it was that he must deal them!

He did not exactly know how the long, superb dinner ended. He sat through it as if he were in a dream, and several times he saw the Earl glance at him in surprise.

But it was over at last, and the gentlemen joined the ladies in the drawing-room. They found Fauntleroy sitting on the sofa with Miss Vivian Herbert,—the great beauty of the last London season; they had been looking at some pictures, and he was thanking his companion as the door opened.

"I'm ever so much obliged to you for being so kind to me!" he was saying; "I never was at a party before, and I've enjoyed myself so much!"

He had enjoyed himself so much that when the gentlemen gathered about Miss Herbert again and began to talk to her, as he listened and tried to understand their laughing speeches, his eyelids began to droop. They drooped until they covered his eyes two or three times, and then the sound of Miss Herbert's low, pretty laugh would bring him back, and he would open them again for about two seconds. He was quite sure he was not going to sleep, but there was a large, yellow satin cushion behind him and his head sank against it, and after a while his eyelids drooped for the last time. They did not even quite open when, as it seemed a long time after, some one kissed him lightly on the cheek. It was Miss Vivian Herbert, who was going away, and she spoke to him softly.

"Good-night, little Lord Fauntleroy," she said. "Sleep well."

And in the morning he did not know that he had tried to open his eyes and had murmured sleepily, "Good-night—I'm so—glad—I saw you— you are so—pretty—"

He only had a very faint recollection of hearing the gentlemen laugh again and of wondering why they did it.

No sooner had the last guest left the room, than Mr. Havisham turned from his place by the fire, and stepped nearer the sofa, where he stood looking down at the sleeping occupant. Little Lord Fauntleroy was taking his ease luxuriously. One leg crossed the other and swung over the edge of the sofa; one arm was flung easily above his head; the warm flush of healthful, happy, childish sleep was on his quiet face; his waving tangle of bright hair strayed over the yellow satin cushion. He made a picture well worth looking at.

As Mr. Havisham looked at it, he put his hand up and rubbed his shaven chin, with a harassed countenance.

"Well, Havisham," said the Earl's harsh voice behind him. "What is it? It is evident something has happened. What was the extraordinary event, if I may ask?"

Mr. Havisham turned from the sofa, still rubbing his chin.

"It was bad news," he answered, "distressing news, my lord—the worst of news. I am sorry to be the bearer of it."

The Earl had been uneasy for some time during the evening, as he glanced at Mr. Havisham, and when he was uneasy he was always illtempered.

"Why do you look so at the boy!" he exclaimed irritably."You have been looking at him all the evening as if—See here now, why should you look at the boy, Havisham, and hang over him like some bird of ill-omen! What has your news to do with Lord Fauntleroy?"

"My lord," said Mr. Havisham, "I will waste no words. My news has everything to do with Lord Fauntleroy. And if we are to believe it—it is not Lord Fauntleroy who lies sleeping before us, but only the son of Captain Errol. And the present Lord Fauntleroy is the son of your son Bevis, and is at this moment in a lodging-house in London."

The Earl clutched the arms of his chair with both his hands until the veins stood out upon them; the veins stood out on his forehead too; his fierce old face was almost livid.

"What do you mean!" he cried out."You are mad! Whose lie is this?"

"If it is a lie," answered Mr. Havisham, "it is painfully like the truth. A woman came to my chambers this morning. She said your son Bevis married her six years ago in London. She showed me her marriage certificate. They quarrelled a year after the marriage, and he paid her to keep away from him. She has a son five years old. She is an American of the lower classes,—an ignorant person,—and until lately she did not fully understand what her son could claim. She consulted a lawyer and found ou tthat the boy was really Lord Fauntleroy and the heir to the earldom of Dorincourt; and she, of course, insists on his claims being acknowledged."

There was a movement of the curly head on the yellow satin cushion. A soft, long, sleepy sigh came from the parted lips, and the little boy stirred in his sleep, but not at all restlessly or uneasily. Not at all as if his slumber were disturbed by the fact that he was being proved a small impostor and that he was not Lord Fauntleroy at all and never would be the Earl of Dorincourt. He only turned his rosy face more on its side, as if to enable the old man who stared at it so solemnly to see it better.

The handsome, grim old face was ghastly. A bitter smile fixed itself upon it.

"I should refuse to believe a word of it," he said, "if it were not such a low, scoundrelly piece of business that it becomes quite possible in connection with the name of my son Bevis. It is quite like Bevis. He was always a disgrace to us. Always a weak, untruthful, vicious young brute with low tastes—my son and heir, Bevis, Lord Fauntleroy. The woman is an ignorant, vulgar person, you say?"

"I am obliged to admit that she can scarcely spell her own name," answered the lawyer. "She is absolutely uneducated and openly mercenary. She cares for nothing but the money. She is very handsome in a coarse way, but—"

The fastidious old lawyer ceased speaking and gave a sort of shudder.

The veins on the old Earl's forehead stood out like purple cords.

Something else stood out upon it too—cold drops of moisture. He took out his handkerchief and swept them away. His smile grew even more bitter.

"And I," he said, "I objected to—to the other woman, the mother of this child" (pointing to the sleeping form on the sofa); "I refused to recognize her. And yet she could spell her own name. I suppose this is retribution."

Suddenly he sprang up from his chair and began to walk up and down the room. Fierce and terrible words poured forth from his lips. His rage and hatred and cruel disappointment shook him as a storm shakes a tree. His violence was something dreadful to see, and yet Mr. Havisham noticed that at the very worst of his wrath he never seemed to forget the little sleeping figure on the yellow satin cushion, and that he never once spoke loud enough to awaken it.

"I might have known it," he said. "They were a disgrace to me from their first hour! I hated them both; and they hated me! Bevis was the worse of the two. I will not believe this yet, though! I will contend against it to the last. But it is like Bevis—it is like him!"

And then he raged again and asked questions about the woman, about her proofs, and pacing the room, turned first white and then purple in his repressed fury.

When at last he had learned all there was to be told, and knew the worst, Mr. Havisham looked at him with a feeling of anxiety. He looked broken and haggard and changed. His rages had always been bad for him, but this one had been worse than the rest because there had been something more than rage in it.

He came slowly back to the sofa, at last, and stood near it.

"If any one had told me I could be fond of a child," he said, his harsh voice low and unsteady, "I should not have believed them. I always detested children—my own more than the rest. I am fond of this one; he is fond of me" (with a bitter smile). "I am not popular; I never was. But he is fond of me. He never was afraid of me—he always trusted me. He would have filled my place better than I have filled it. I know that. He would have been an honor to the name."

He bent down and stood a minute or so looking at the happy, sleeping face. His shaggy eyebrows were knitted fiercely, and yet somehow he did not seem fierce at all. He put up his hand, pushed the bright hair back from the forehead, and then turned away and rang the bell.

When the largest footman appeared, he pointed to the sofa.

"Take"—he said, and then his voice changed a little—"take Lord Fauntleroy to his room."





Chapter 11　Anxiety in America


When Mr. Hobbs's young friend left him to go to Dorincourt Castle and become Lord Fauntleroy, and the grocery-man had time to realize that the Atlantic Ocean lay between himself and the small companion who had spent so many agreeable hours in his society, he really began to feel very lonely indeed. The fact was, Mr. Hobbs was not a clever man nor even a bright one; he was, indeed, rather a slow and heavy person, and he had never made many acquaintances. He was not mentally energetic enough to know how to amuse himself, and in truth he never did anything of an entertaining nature but read the newspapers and add up his accounts. It was not very easy for him to add up his accounts, and sometimes it took him a long time to bring them out right; and in the old days, little Lord Fauntleroy, who had learned how to add up quite nicely with his fingers and a slate and pencil, had sometimes even gone to the length of trying to help him; and, then too, he had been so good a listener and had taken such an interest in what the newspaper said, and he and Mr. Hobbs had held such long conversations about the Revolution and the British and the elections and the Republican party, that it was no wonder his going left a blank in the grocery store. At first it seemed to Mr. Hobbs that Cedric was not really far away, and would come back again; that some day he would look up from his paper and see the little lad standing in the doorway, in his white suit and red stockings, and with his straw hat on the back of his head, and would hear him say in his cheerful little voice: "Hello, Mr. Hobbs! This is a hot day—isn't it?" But as the days passed on and this did not happen, Mr. Hobbs felt very dull and uneasy. He did not even enjoy his newspaper as much as he used to. He would put the paper down on his knee after reading it, and sit and stare at the high stool for a long time. There were some marks on the long legs which made him feel quite dejected and melancholy. They were marks made by the heels of the next Earl of Dorincourt, when he kicked and talked at the same time. It seems that even youthful earls kick the legs of things they sit on;—noble blood and lofty lineage do not prevent it. After looking at those marks, Mr. Hobbs would take out his gold watch and open it and stare at the inscription: "From his oldest friend, Lord Fauntleroy, to Mr. Hobbs. When this you see, remember me." And after staring at it awhile, he would shut it up with a loud snap, and sigh and get up and go and stand in the doorway—between the box of potatoes and the barrel of apples—and look up the street. At night, when the store was closed, he would light his pipe and walk slowly along the pavement until he reached the house where Cedric had lived, on which there was a sign that read, "This House to Let"; and he would stop near it and look up and shake his head, and puff at his pipe very hard, and after a while walk mournfully back again.

This went on for two or three weeks before any new idea came to him. Being slow and ponderous, it always took him a long time to reach a new idea. As a rule, he did not like new ideas, but preferred old ones. After two or three weeks, however, during which, instead of getting better, matters really grew worse, a novel plan slowly and deliberately dawned upon him. He would go to see Dick. He smoked a great many pipes before he arrived at the conclusion, but finally he did arrive at it. He would go to see Dick. He knew all about Dick. Cedric had told him, and his idea was that perhaps Dick might be some comfort to him in the way of talking things over.

So one day when Dick was very hard at work blacking a customer's boots, a short, stout man with a heavy face and a bald head stopped on the pavement and stared for two or three minutes at the bootblack's sign, which read:

"PROFESSOR DICK TIPTON CAN'T BE BEAT."

He stared at it so long that Dick began to take a lively interest in him, and when he had put the finishing touch to his customer's boots, he said:

"Want a shine, sir?"

The stout man came forward deliberately and put his foot on the rest.

"Yes," he said.

Then when Dick fell to work, the stout man looked from Dick to the sign and from the sign to Dick.

"Where did you get that?" he asked.

"From a friend o' mine," said Dick,—"a little feller. He guv' me the whole outfit. He was the best little feller ye ever saw. He's in England now. Gone to be one o' them lords."

"Lord—Lord—" asked Mr. Hobbs, with ponderous slowness, "Lord Fauntleroy—Goin' to be Earl of Dorincourt?"

Dick almost dropped his brush.

"Why, boss!" he exclaimed,"d' ye know him yerself?"

"I've known him," answered Mr. Hobbs, wiping his warm forehead, "ever since he was born. We was lifetime acquaintances—that's what WE was."

It really made him feel quite agitated to speak of it. He pulled the splendid gold watch out of his pocket and opened it, and showed the inside of the case to Dick.

"'When this you see, remember me,'" he read. "That was his parting keepsake to me 'I don't want you to forget me'—those was his words—I'd ha' remembered him," he went on, shaking his head, "if he hadn't given me a thing an' I hadn't seen hide nor hair on him again. He was a companion as ANY man would remember."

"He was the nicest little feller I ever see," said Dick. "An' as to sand—I never seen so much sand to a little feller. I thought a heap o' him, I did,—an' we was friends, too—we was sort o' chums from the fust, that little young un an' me. I grabbed his ball from under a stage fur him, an' he never forgot it; an' he'd come down here, he would, with his mother or his nuss and he'd holler: 'Hello, Dick!' at me, as friendly as if he was six feet high, when he warn't knee high to a grasshopper, and was dressed in gal's col'es. He was a gay little chap, and when you was down on your luck, it did you good to talk to him."

"That's so," said Mr. Hobbs. "It was a pity to make a earl out of HIM. He would have SHONE in the grocery business—or dry goods either; he would have SHONE!" And he shook his head with deeper regret than ever.

It proved that they had so much to say to each other that it was not possible to say it all at one time, and so it was agreed that the next night Dick should make a visit to the store and keep Mr. Hobbs company. The plan pleased Dick well enough. He had been a street waif nearly all his life, but he had never been a bad boy, and he had always had a private yearning for a more respectable kind of existence. Since he had been in business for himself, he had made enough money to enable him to sleep under a roof instead of out in the streets, and he had begun to hope he might reach even a higher plane, in time. So, to be invited to call on a stout, respectable man who owned a corner store, and even had a horse and wagon, seemed to him quite an event.

"Do you know anything about earls and castles?" Mr. Hobbs inquired. "I'd like to know more of the particklars."

"There's a story about some on 'em in the Penny Story Gazette," said Dick. "It's called the 'Crime of a Coronet; or, The Revenge of the Countess May.' It's a boss thing, too. Some of us boys 're takin' it to read."

"Bring it up when you come," said Mr. Hobbs, "an' I'll pay for it. Bring all you can find that have any earls in 'em. If there aren't earls, markises'll do, or dooks—though HE never made mention of any dooks or markises. We did go over coronets a little, but I never happened to see any. I guess they don't keep 'em ' round here."

"Tiffany'd have 'em if anybody did," said Dick, "but I don't know as I'd know one if I saw it."

Mr. Hobbs did not explain that he would not have known one if he saw it, he merely shook his head ponderously.

"I s'pose there is very little call for 'em," he said, and that ended the matter.

This was the beginning of quite a substantial friendship. When Dick went up to the store, Mr. Hobbs received him with great hospitality. He gave him a chair tilted against the door, near a barrel of apples, and after his young visitor was seated, he made a jerk at them with the hand in which he held his pipe, saying:

"Help yerself."

Then he looked at the story papers, and after that they read and discussed the British aristocracy; and Mr. Hobbs smoked his pipe very hard and shook his head a great deal. He shook it most when he pointed out the high stool with the marks on its legs.

"There's his very kicks," he said impressively; "his very kicks. I sit and look at 'em by the hour. This is a world of ups an' it's a world of downs. Why, he'd set there, an' eat crackers out of a box, an' apples out of a barrel, an' pitch his cores into the street; an' now he's a lord a-livin' in a castle. Them's a lord's kicks; they'll be a earl's kicks some day. Sometimes I says to myself, says I, 'Well, I'll be jiggered!'"

He seemed to derive a great deal of comfort from his reflections and Dick's visit. Before Dick went home, they had a supper in the small backroom; they had crackers and cheese and sardines, and other canned things out of the store, and Mr. Hobbs solemnly opened two bottles of ginger ale, and pouring out two glasses, proposed a toast.

"Here's to HIM!" he said, lifting his glass, "an' may he teach 'em a lesson—earls an' markises an' dooks an' all!"

After that night, the two saw each other often, and Mr. Hobbs was much more comfortable and less desolate. They read the Penny Story Gazette, and many other interesting things, and gained a knowledge of the habits of the nobility and gentry which would have surprised those despised classes if they had realized it. One day Mr. Hobbs made a pilgrimage to a book store down town, for the express purpose of adding to their library. He went to the clerk and leaned over the counter to speak to him.

"I want," he said, "a book about earls."

"What!" exclaimed the clerk.

"A book," repeated the grocery-man, "about earls."

"I'm afraid," said the clerk, looking rather queer, "that we haven't what you want."

"Haven't?" said Mr. Hobbs, anxiously. "Well, say markises then—or dooks."

"I know of no such book," answered the clerk.

Mr. Hobbs was much disturbed. He looked down on the floor,—then he looked up.

"None about female earls?" he inquired.

"I'm afraid not," said the clerk with a smile.

"Well," exclaimed Mr. Hobbs, "I'll be jiggered!"

He was just going out of the store, when the clerk called him back and asked him if a story in which the nobility were chief characters would do. Mr. Hobbs said it would—if he could not get an entire volume devoted to earls. So the clerk sold him a book called "The Tower of London," written by Mr. Harrison Ainsworth, and he carried it home.

When Dick came they began to read it. It was a very wonderful and exciting book, and the scene was laid in the reign of the famous English queen who is called by some people Bloody Mary. And as Mr. Hobbs heard of Queen Mary's deeds and the habit she had of chopping people's heads off, putting them to the torture, and burning them alive, he became very much excited. He took his pipe out of his mouth and stared at Dick, and at last he was obliged to mop the perspiration from his brow with his red pocket handkerchief.

"Why, he ain't safe!" he said. "He ain't safe! If the women folks can sit up on their thrones an' give the word for things like that to be done, who's to know what's happening to him this very minute? He's no more safe than nothing! Just let a woman like that get mad, an' no one's safe!"

"Well," said Dick, though he looked rather anxious himself; "ye see this 'ere un isn't the one that's bossin' things now. I know her name's Victory, an' this un here in the book, her name's Mary."

"So it is," said Mr. Hobbs, still mopping his forehead; "so it is. An' the newspapers are not sayin' anything about any racks, thumb-screws, or stakeburnin's,—but still it doesn't seem as if 't was safe for him over there with those queer folks. Why, they tell me they don't keep the Fourth o' July!"

He was privately uneasy for several days; and it was not until he received Fauntleroy's letter and had read it several times, both to himself and to Dick, and had also read the letter Dick got about the same time, that he became composed again.

But they both found great pleasure in their letters. They read and reread them, and talked them over and enjoyed every word of them. And they spent days over the answers they sent and read them over almost as often as the letters they had received.

It was rather a labor for Dick to write his. All his knowledge of reading and writing he had gained during a few months, when he had lived with his elder brother, and had gone to a night-school; but, being a sharp boy, he had made the most of that brief education, and had spelled out things in newspapers since then, and practiced writing with bits of chalk on pavements or walls or fences. He told Mr. Hobbs all about his life and about his elder brother, who had been rather good to him after their mother died, when Dick was quite a little fellow. Their father had died some time before. The brother's name was Ben, and he had taken care of Dick as well as he could, until the boy was old enough to sell newspapers and run errands. They had lived together, and as he grew older Ben had managed to get along until he had quite in a store.

"And then," exclaimed Dick with disgust, "blest if he didn't go an' marry a gal! Just went and got spoony an' hadn't any more sense left! Married her, an' set up housekeepin' in two back rooms. An' a hefty un she was, —a regular tiger-cat. She'd tear things to pieces when she got mad, —and she was mad ALL the time. Had a baby just like her, —yell day 'n' night! An' if I didn't have to 'tend it! an' when it screamed, she'd fire things at me. She fired a plate at me one day, an' hit the baby—cut its chin. Doctor said he'd carry the mark till he died. A nice mother she was! Crackey! But didn't we have a time—Ben 'n' mehself 'n' the young un. She was mad at Ben because he didn't make money faster; 'n' at last he went out West with a man to set up a cattle ranch. An' hadn't been gone a week' fore one night, I got home from sellin' my papers, 'n’ the rooms wus locked up 'n' empty, 'n' the woman o' the house, she told me Minna'd gone—shown a clean pair o' heels. Some un else said she'd gone across the water to be nuss to a lady as had a little baby, too. Never heard a word of her since—nuther has Ben. If I'd ha' bin him, I wouldn't ha' fretted a bit—'n' I guess he didn't. But he thought a heap o' her at the start. Tell you, he was spoons on her. She was a daisy-lookin' gal, too, when she was dressed up 'n' not mad. She'd big black eyes 'n' black hair down to her knees; she'd make it into a rope as big as your arm, and twist it 'round 'n' 'round her head; 'n' I tell you her eyes 'd snap! Folks used to say she was part Itali-un—said her mother or father 'd come from there, 'n' it made her queer. I tell ye, she was one of 'em—she was!"

He often told Mr. Hobbs stories of her and of his brother Ben, who, since his going out West, had written once or twice to Dick.

Ben's luck had not been good, and he had wandered from place to place; but at last he had settled on a ranch in California, where he was at work at the time when Dick became acquainted with Mr. Hobbs.

"That gal," said Dick one day, "she took all the grit out o' him. I couldn't help feelin' sorry for him sometimes."

They were sitting in the store door-way together, and Mr. Hobbs was filling his pipe.

"He oughtn't to 've married," he said solemnly, as he rose to get a match. "Women—I never could see any use in 'em myself."

As he took the match from its box, he stopped and looked down on the counter.

"Why!" he said, "if here isn't a letter! I didn't see it before. The postman must have laid it down when I wasn't noticin', or the newspaper slipped over it."

He picked it up and looked at it carefully.

"It's from HIM!" he exclaimed. "That's the very one it's from!"

He forgot his pipe altogether. He went back to his chair quite excited and took his pocket-knife and opened the envelope.

"I wonder what news there is this time," he said.

And then he unfolded the letter and read as follows:

"DORINCOURT CASTLE."

"My dear Mr. Hobbs."

"I write this in a great hury becaus i have something curous to tell you i know you will be very mutch suprised my dear frend when i tel you. It is all a mistake and i am not a lord and I shall not have to be an earl there is a lady whitch was marid to my uncle bevis who is dead and she has a little boy and he is lord fauntleroy becaus that is the way it is in England the earls eldest sons little boy is the earl if every body else is dead i mean if his farther and grandfarther are dead my grandfarther is not dead but my uncle bevis is and so his boy is lord Fauntleroy and i am not becaus my papa was the youngest son and my name is Cedric Errol like it was when i was in New York and all the things will belong to the other boy i thought at first i should have to give him my pony and cart but my grandfarther says i need not my grandfarther is very sorry and i think he does not like the lady but preaps he thinks dearest and i are sorry because i shall not be an earl i would like to be an earl now better than i thout i would at first becaus this is a beautifle castle and i like every body so and when you are rich you can do so many things i am not rich now becaus when your papa is only the youngest son he is not very rich i am going to learn to work so that i can take care of dearest i have been asking Wilkins about grooming horses preaps i might be a groom or a coachman. The lady brought her little boy to the castle and my grandfarther and Mr. Havisham talked to her i think she was angry she talked loud and my grandfarther was angry too i never saw him angry before i wish it did not make them all mad i thort i would tell you and Dick right away becaus you would be intrusted so no more at present with love from."

"your old frend."

"CEDRIC ERROL (Not lord Fauntleroy)."

Mr. Hobbs fell back in his chair, the letter dropped on his knee, his penknife slipped to the floor, and so did the envelope.

"Well!" he ejaculated, "I am jiggered!"

He was so dumfounded that he actually changed his exclamation.

It had always been his habit to say, "I WILL be jiggered," but this time he said, "I AM jiggered." Perhaps he really WAS jiggered. There is no knowing.

"Well," said Dick, "the whole thing's bust up, hasn't it?"

"Bust!" said Mr. Hobbs. "It's my opinion it's a put-up job o' the British ristycrats to rob him of his rights because he's an American. They've had a spite agin us ever since the Revolution, an' they're takin' it out on him. I told you he wasn't safe, an' see what's happened! Like as not, the whole gover'ment's got together to rob him of his lawful ownin's."

He was very much agitated. He had not approved of the change in his young friend's circumstances at first, but lately he had become more reconciled to it, and after the receipt of Cedric's letter he had perhaps even felt some secret pride in his young friend's magnificence. He might not have a good opinion of earls, but he knew that even in America money was considered rather an agreeable thing, and if all the wealth and grandeur were to go with the title, it must be rather hard to lose it.

"They're trying to rob him!" he said, "that's what they're doing, and folks that have money ought to look after him."

And he kept Dick with him until quite a late hour to talk it over, and when that young man left, he went with him to the corner of the street; and on his way back he stopped opposite the empty house for some time, staring at the "To Let," and smoking his pipe, in much disturbance of mind.





Chapter 12　The Rival Claimants


A very few days after the dinner party at the Castle, almost everybody in England who read the newspapers at all knew the romantic story of what had happened at Dorincourt. It made a very interesting story when it was told with all the details. There was the little American boy who had been brought to England to be Lord Fauntleroy, and who was said to be so fine and handsome a little fellow, and to have already made people fond of him; there was the old Earl, his grandfather, who was so proud of his heir; there was the pretty young mother who had never been forgiven for marrying Captain Errol; and there was the strange marriage of Bevis, the dead Lord Fauntleroy, and the strange wife, of whom no one knew anything, suddenly appearing with her son, and saying that he was the real Lord Fauntleroy and must have his rights. All these things were talked about and written about, and caused a tremendous sensation. And then there came the rumor that the Earl of Dorincourt was not satisfied with the turn affairs had taken, and would perhaps contest the claim by law, and the matter might end with a wonderful trial.

There never had been such excitement before in the county in which Erleboro was situated. On market-days, people stood in groups and talked and wondered what would be done; the farmers' wives invited one another to tea that they might tell one another all they had heard and all they thought and all they thought other people thought. They related wonderful anecdotes about the Earl's rage and his determination not to acknowledge the new Lord Fauntleroy, and his hatred of the woman who was the claimant's mother. But, of course, it was Mrs. Dibble who could tell the most, and who was more in demand than ever.

"An' a bad lookout it is," she said. "An' if you were to ask me, ma'am, I should say as it was a judgment on him for the way he's treated that sweet young cre'tur' as he parted from her child, —for he's got that fond of him an' that set on him an' that proud of him as he's a'most drove mad by what's happened. An' what's more, this new one's no lady, as his little lordship's ma is. She's a bold-faced, black-eyed thing, as Mr. Thomas says no gentleman in livery 'u'd bemean hisself to be gave orders by; and let her come into the house, he says, an' he goes out of it. An' the boy don't no more compare with the other one than nothin' you could mention. An' mercy knows what's goin' to come of it all, an' where it's to end, an' you might have knocked me down with a feather when Jane brought the news."

In fact there was excitement everywhere at the Castle: in the library, where the Earl and Mr. Havisham sat and talked; in the servants' hall, where Mr. Thomas and the butler and the other men and women servants gossiped and exclaimed at all times of the day; and in the stables, where Wilkins went about his work in a quite depressed state of mind, and groomed the brown pony more beautifully than ever, and said mournfully to the coachman that he "never taught a young gen'leman to ride as took to it more nat'ral, or was a better-plucked one than he was. He was a one as it were some pleasure to ride behind."

But in the midst of all the disturbance there was one person who was quite calm and untroubled. That person was the little Lord Fauntleroy who was said not to be Lord Fauntleroy at all. When first the state of affairs had been explained to him, he had felt some little anxiousness and perplexity, it is true, but its foundation was not in baffled ambition.

While the Earl told him what had happened, he had sat on a stool holding on to his knee, as he so often did when he was listening to anything interesting; and by the time the story was finished he looked quite sober.

"It makes me feel very queer," he said; "it makes me feel—queer!"

The Earl looked at the boy in silence. It made him feel queer, too—queerer than he had ever felt in his whole life. And he felt more queer still when he saw that there was a troubled expression on the small face which was usually so happy.

"Will they take Dearest's house from her—and her carriage?" Cedric asked in a rather unsteady, anxious little voice.

"NO!" said the Earl decidedly—in quite a loud voice, in fact. "They can take nothing from her."

"Ah!" said Cedric, with evident relief. "Can't they?"

Then he looked up at his grandfather, and there was a wistful shade in his eyes, and they looked very big and soft.

"That other boy," he said rather tremulously—"he will have to—to be your boy now—as I was—won't he?"

"NO!" answered the Earl—and he said it so fiercely and loudly that Cedric quite jumped.

"No?" he exclaimed, in wonderment. "Won't he? I thought—"

He stood up from his stool quite suddenly.

"Shall I be your boy, even if I'm not going to be an earl?" he said. "Shall I be your boy, just as I was before?" And his flushed little face was all alight with eagerness.

How the old Earl did look at him from head to foot, to be sure! How his great shaggy brows did draw themselves together, and how queerly his deep eyes shone under them—how very queerly!

"My boy!" he said—and, if you'll believe it, his very voice was queer, almost shaky and a little broken and hoarse, not at all what you would expect an Earl's voice to be, though he spoke more decidedly and peremptorily even than before,—"Yes, you'll be my boy as long as I live; and, by George, sometimes I feel as if you were the only boy I had ever had."

Cedric's face turned red to the roots of his hair; it turned red with relief and pleasure. He put both his hands deep into his pockets and looked squarely into his noble relative's eyes.

"Do you?" he said. "Well, then, I don't care about the earl part at all. I don't care whether I'm an earl or not. I thought—you see, I thought the one that was going to be the Earl would have to be your boy, too, and—and I couldn't be. That was what made me feel so queer."

The Earl put his hand on his shoulder and drew him nearer.

"They shall take nothing from you that I can hold for you," he said, drawing his breath hard. "I won't believe yet that they can take anything from you. You were made for the place, and—well, you may fill it still. But whatever comes, you shall have all that I can give you—all!"

It scarcely seemed as if he were speaking to a child, there was such determination in his face and voice; it was more as if he were making a promise to himself—and perhaps he was.

He had never before known how deep a hold upon him his fondness for the boy and his pride in him had taken. He had never seen his strength and good qualities and beauty as he seemed to see them now. To his obstinate nature it seemed impossible—more than impossible—to give up what he had so set his heart upon. And he had determined that he would not give it up without a fierce struggle.

Within a few days after she had seen Mr. Havisham, the woman who claimed to be Lady Fauntleroy presented herself at the Castle, and brought her child with her. She was sent away. The Earl would not see her, she was told by the footman at the door; his lawyer would attend to her case. It was Thomas who gave the message, and who expressed his opinion of her freely afterward, in the servants' hall. He "hoped," he said, "as he had wore livery in 'igh famblies long enough to know a lady when he see one, an' if that was a lady he was no judge o' females."

"The one at the Lodge," added Thomas loftily, "'Merican or no 'Merican, she's one o' the right sort, as any gentleman 'u'd reckinize with all a heye. I remarked it myself to Henery when fust we called there."

The woman drove away; the look on her handsome, common face half frightened, half fierce. Mr. Havisham had noticed, during his interviews with her, that though she had a passionate temper, and a coarse, insolent manner, she was neither so clever nor so bold as she meant to be; she seemed sometimes to be almost overwhelmed by the position in which she had placed herself. It was as if she had not expected to meet with such opposition.

"She is evidently," the lawyer said to Mrs. Errol, "a person from the lower walks of life. She is uneducated and untrained in everything, and quite unused to meeting people like ourselves on any terms of equality. She does not know what to do. Her visit to the Castle quite cowed her. She was infuriated, but she was cowed. The Earl would not receive her, but I advised him to go with me to the Dorincourt Arms, where she is staying. When she saw him enter the room, she turned white, though she flew into a rage at once, and threatened and demanded in one breath."

The fact was that the Earl had stalked into the room and stood, looking like a venerable aristocratic giant, staring at the woman from under his beetling brows, and not condescending a word. He simply stared at her, taking her in from head to foot as if she were some repulsive curiosity. He let her talk and demand until she was tired, without himself uttering a word, and then he said:

"You say you are my eldest son's wife. If that is true, and if the proof you offer is too much for us, the law is on your side. In that case, your boy is Lord Fauntleroy. The matter will be sifted to the bottom, you may rest assured. If your claims are proved, you will be provided for. I want to see nothing of either you or the child so long as I live. The place will unfortunately have enough of you after my death. You are exactly the kind of person I should have expected my son Bevis to choose."

And then he turned his back upon her and stalked out of the room as he had stalked into it.

Not many days after that, a visitor was announced to Mrs. Errol, who was writing in her little morning room. The maid, who brought the message, looked rather excited; her eyes were quite round with amazement, in fact, and being young and inexperienced, she regarded her mistress with nervous sympathy.

"It's the Earl hisself, ma'am!" she said in tremulous awe.

When Mrs. Errol entered the drawing-room, a very tall, majesticlooking old man was standing on the tiger-skin rug. He had a handsome, grim old face, with an aquiline profile, a long white mustache, and an obstinate look.

"Mrs. Errol, I believe?" he said.

"Mrs. Errol," she answered.

"I am the Earl of Dorincourt," he said.

He paused a moment, almost unconsciously, to look into her uplifted eyes. They were so like the big, affectionate, childish eyes he had seen uplifted to his own so often every day during the last few months, that they gave him a quite curious sensation.

"The boy is very like you," he said abruptly.

"It has been often said so, my lord," she replied, "but I have been glad to think him like his father also."

As Lady Lorridaile had told him, her voice was very sweet, and her manner was very simple and dignified. She did not seem in the least troubled by his sudden coming.

"Yes," said the Earl. "he is like—my son—too." He put his hand up to his big white mustache and pulled it fiercely."Do you know," he said, "why I have come here?"

"I have seen Mr. Havisham," Mrs. Errol began, "and he has told me of the claims which have been made—"

"I have come to tell you," said the Earl, "that they will be investigated and contested, if a contest can be made. I have come to tell you that the boy shall be defended with all the power of the law. His rights—"

The soft voice interrupted him.

"He must have nothing that is NOT his by right, even if the law can give it to him," she said.

"Unfortunately the law can not," said the Earl. "If it could, it should. This outrageous woman and her child—"

"Perhaps she cares for him as much as I care for Cedric, my lord," said little Mrs. Errol. "And if she was your eldest son's wife, her son is Lord Fauntleroy, and mine is not."

She was no more afraid of him than Cedric had been, and she looked at him just as Cedric would have looked, and he, having been an old tyrant all his life, was privately pleased by it. People so seldom dared to differ from him that there was an entertaining novelty in it.

"I suppose," he said, scowling slightly, "that you would much prefer that he should not be the Earl of Dorincourt." Her fair young face flushed.

"It is a very magnificent thing to be the Earl of Dorincourt, my lord," she said. "I know that, but I care most that he should be what his father was—brave and just and true always." "In striking contrast to what his grandfather was, eh?" said his lordship sardonically.

"I have not had the pleasure of knowing his grandfather," replied Mrs. Errol, "but I know my little boy believes—" She stopped short a moment, looking quietly into his face, and then she added, "I know that Cedric loves you."

"Would he have loved me," said the Earl dryly, "if you had told him why I did not receive you at the Castle?"

"No," answered Mrs. Errol, "I think not. That was why I did not wish him to know."

"Well," said my lord brusquely, "there are few women who would not have told him."

He suddenly began to walk up and down the room, pulling his great mustache more violently than ever.

"Yes, he is fond of me," he said, "and I am fond of him. I can't say I ever was fond of anything before. I am fond of him. He pleased me from the first. I am an old man, and was tired of my life. He has given me something to live for. I am proud of him. I was satisfied to think of his taking his place some day as the head of the family."

He came back and stood before Mrs. Errol.

"I am miserable," he said. "Miserable!"

He looked as if he was. Even his pride could not keep his voice steady or his hands from shaking. For a moment it almost seemed as if his deep, fierce eyes had tears in them. "Perhaps it is because I am miserable that I have come to you," he said, quite glaring down at her. "I used to hate you; I have been jealous of you. This wretched, disgraceful business has changed that. After seeing that repulsive woman who calls herself the wife of my son Bevis, I actually felt it would be a relief to look at you. I have been an obstinate old fool, and I suppose I have treated you badly. You are like the boy, and the boy is the first object in my life. I am miserable, and I came to you merely because you are like the boy, and he cares for you, and I care for him. Treat me as well as you can, for the boy's sake."

He said it all in his harsh voice, and almost roughly, but somehow he seemed so broken down for the time that Mrs. Errol was touched to the heart. She got up and moved an arm-chair a little forward.

"I wish you would sit down," she said in a soft, pretty, sympathetic way. "You have been so much troubled that you are very tired, and you need all your strength."

It was just as new to him to be spoken to and cared for in that gentle, simple ways as it was to be contradicted. He was reminded of "the boy" again, and he actually did as she asked him. Perhaps his disappointment and wretchedness were good discipline for him; if he had not been wretched he might have continued to hate her, but just at present he found her a little soothing. Almost anything would have seemed pleasant by contrast with Lady Fauntleroy; and this one had so sweet a face and voice, and a pretty dignity when she spoke or moved. Very soon, through the quiet magic of these influences, he began to feel less gloomy, and then he talked still more.

"Whatever happens," he said, "the boy shall be provided for. He shall be taken care of, now and in the future."

Before he went away, he glanced around the room.

"Do you like the house?" he demanded.

"Very much," she answered.

"This is a cheerful room," he said. "May I come here again and talk this matter over?"

"As often as you wish, my lord," she replied.

And then he went out to his carriage and drove away, Thomas and Henry almost stricken dump upon the box at the turn affairs had taken.





Chapter 13　Dick to the Rescue


OF course, as soon as the story of Lord Fauntleroy and the difficulties of the Earl of Dorincourt were discussed in the English newspapers, they were discussed in the American newspapers. The story was too interesting to be passed over lightly, and it was talked of a great deal. There were so many versions of it that it would have been an edifying thing to buy all the papers and compare them. Mr. Hobbs read so much about it that he became quite bewildered. One paper described his young friend Cedric as an infant in arms,—another as a young man at Oxford, winning all the honors, and distinguishing himself by writing Greek poems; one said he was engaged to a young lady of great beauty, who was the daughter of a duke; another said he had just been married; the only thing, in fact, which was NOT said was that he was a little boy between seven and eight, with handsome legs and curly hair. One said he was no relation to the Earl of Dorincourt at all, but was a small impostor who had sold newspapers and slept in the streets of New York before his mother imposed upon the family lawyer, who came to America to look for the Earl's heir. Then came the descriptions of the new Lord Fauntleroy and his mother. Sometimes she was a gypsy, sometimes an actress, sometimes a beautiful Spaniard; but it was always agreed that the Earl of Dorincourt was her deadly enemy, and would not acknowledge her son as his heir if he could help it, and as there seemed to be some slight flaw in the papers she had produced, it was expected that there would be a long trial, which would be far more interesting than anything ever carried into court before. Mr. Hobbs used to read the papers until his head was in a whirl, and in the evening he and Dick would talk it all over. They found out what an important personage an Earl of Dorincourt was, and what a magnificent income he possessed, and how many estates he owned, and how stately and beautiful was the Castle in which he lived; and the more they learned, the more excited they became.

"Seems like somethin' orter be done," said Mr. Hobbs. "Things like them orter to be held on to—earls or no earls."

But there really was nothing they could do but each write a letter to Cedric, containing assurances of their friendship and sympathy. They wrote those letters as soon as they could after receiving the news; and after having written them, they handed them over to each other to be read.

This is what Mr. Hobbs read in Dick's letter:





"DERE FREND:

i got ure letter an Mr. Hobbs got his an we are sory u are down on ure luck an we say hold on as longs u kin an dont let no one git ahed of u. There is a lot of ole theves wil make al they kin of u ef u dont kepe ure i skined. But this is mosly to say that ive not forgot wot u did fur me an if there aint no better way cum over here an go in pardners with me. Biznes is fine an ile see no harm cums to u Enny big feler that trise to cum it over u wil hafter setle it fust with Perfessor Dick Tipton. So no more at present.

DICK."





And this was what Dick read in Mr. Hobbs's letter:





"DEAR SIR:

Yrs received and wd say things looks bad. I believe its a put up job and them thats done it ought to be looked after sharp. And what I write to say is two things. Im going to look this thing up. Keep quiet and Ill see a lawyer and do all I can And if the worst happens and them earls is too many for us theres a partnership in the grocery business ready for you when yure old enough and a home and a friend in."

Yrs truly,

"SILAS HOBBS."





"Well," said Mr. Hobbs, "he's pervided for between us, if he aint a earl."

"So he is," said Dick. "I'd ha' stood by him. Blest if I didn't like that little feller fust-rate."

The very next morning, one of Dick's customers was rather surprised. He was a young lawyer just beginning practice—as poor as a very young lawyer can possibly be, but a bright, energetic young fellow, with sharp wit and a good temper. He had a shabby office near Dick's stand, and every morning Dick blacked his boots for him, and quiteoften they were not exactly water-tight, but he always had a friendly word or a joke for Dick.

That particular morning, when he put his foot on the rest, he had an illustrated paper in his hand—an enterprising paper, with pictures in it of conspicuous people and things. He had just finished looking it over, and when the last boot was polished, he handed it over to the boy.

"Here's a paper for you, Dick," he said; "you can look it over when you drop in at Delmonico's for your breakfast. Picture of an English castle in it, and an English earl's daughter-in-law. Fine young woman, too,—lots of hair,—though she seems to be raising rather a row. You ought to become familiar with the nobility and gentry, Dick. Begin on the Right Honorable the Earl of Dorincourt and Lady Fauntleroy. Hello! I say, what's the matter?"

The pictures he spoke of were on the front page, and Dick was staring at one of them with his eyes and mouth open, and his sharp face almost pale with excitement.

"What's to pay, Dick?" said the young man. "What has paralyzed you?"

Dick really did look as if something tremendous had happened. He pointed to the picture, under which was written:

"Mother of Claimant (Lady Fauntleroy)."

It was the picture of a handsome woman, with large eyes and heavy braids of black hair wound around her head.

"Her!" said Dick. "My, I know her better 'n I know you!"

The young man began to laugh.

"Where did you meet her, Dick?" he said. "At Newport? Or when you ran over to Paris the last time?"

Dick actually forgot to grin. He began to gather his brushes and things together, as if he had something to do which would put an end to his business for the present.

"Never mind," he said. "I know her! An I've struck work for this mornin'."

And in less than five minutes from that time he was tearing through the streets on his way to Mr. Hobbs and the corner store.

Mr. Hobbs could scarcely believe the evidence of his senses when he looked across the counter and saw Dick rush in with the paper in his hand. The boy was out of breath with running; so much out of breath, in fact, that he could scarcely speak as he threw the paper down on the counter.

"Hello!" exclaimed Mr. Hobbs. "Hello! What you got there?"

"Look at it!" panted Dick. "Look at that woman in the picture! That's what you look at! SHE aint no 'ristocrat, SHE aint!" with withering scorn. "She's no lord's wife. You may eat me, if it aint Minna—MINNA! I'd know her anywheres, an' so 'd Ben. Jest ax him."

Mr. Hobbs dropped into his seat.

"I knowed it was a put-up job," he said. "I knowed it; and they done it on account o' him bein' a 'Merican!"

"Done it!" cried Dick, with disgust. "SHE done it, that's who done it. She was allers up to her tricks; an' I'll tell yer wot come to me, the minnit I saw her pictur. There was one o' them papers we saw had a letter in it that said somethin' 'bout her boy, an' it said he had a scar on his chin. Put them two together—her 'n' that there scar! Why, that there boy o' hers aint no more a lord than I am! It's BEN's boy,—the little chap she hit when she let fly that plate at me."

Professor Dick Tipton had always been a sharp boy, and earning his living in the streets of a big city had made him still sharper. He had learned to keep his eyes open and his wits about him, and it must be confessed he enjoyed immensely the excitement and impatience of that moment. If little Lord Fauntleroy could only have looked into the store that morning, he would certainly have been interested, even if all the discussion and plans had been intended to decide the fate of some other boy than himself.

Mr. Hobbs was almost overwhelmed by his sense of responsibility, and Dick was all alive and full of energy. He began to write a letter to Ben, and he cut out the picture and inclosed it to him, and Mr. Hobbs wrote a letter to Cedric and one to the Earl. They were in the midst of this letterwriting when a new idea came to Dick.

"Say," he said, "the feller that give me the paper, he's a lawyer. Let's ax him what we'd better do. Lawyers knows it all."

Mr. Hobbs was immensely impressed by this suggestion and Dick's business capacity.

"That's so!" he replied. "This here calls for lawyers."

And leaving the store in the care of a substitute, he struggled into his coat and marched down-town with Dick, and the two presented themselves with their romantic story in Mr. Harrison's office, much to that young man's astonishment.

If he had not been a very young lawyer, with a very enterprising mind and a great deal of spare time on his hands, he might not have been so readily interested in what they had to say, for it all certainly sounded very wild and queer; but he chanced to want something to do very much, and he chanced to know Dick, and Dick chanced to say his say in a very sharp, telling sort of way.

"And," said Mr. Hobbs, "say what your time's worth a' hour and look into this thing thorough, and I'LL pay the damage,—Silas Hobbs, corner of Blank street, Vegetables and Fancy Groceries."

"Well," said Mr. Harrison, "it will be a big thing if it turns out all right, and it will be almost as big a thing for me as for Lord Fauntleroy; and, at any rate, no harm can be done by investigating. It appears there has been some dubiousness about the child. The woman contradicted herself in some of her statements about his age, and aroused suspicion. The first persons to be written to are Dick's brother and the Earl of Dorincourt's family lawyer."

And actually, before the sun went down, two letters had been written and sent in two different directions—one speeding out of New York harbor on a mail steamer on its way to England, and the other on a train carrying letters and passengers bound for California. And the first was addressed to T. Havisham, Esq., and the second to Benjamin Tipton.

And after the store was closed that evening, Mr. Hobbs and Dick sat in the back-room and talked together until midnight.





Chapter 14　The Exposure


It is astonishing how short a time it takes for very wonderful things to happen. It had taken only a few minutes, apparently, to change all the fortunes of the little boy dangling his red legs from the high stool in Mr. Hobbs's store, and to transform him from a small boy, living the simplest life in a quiet street, into an English nobleman, the heir to an earldom and magnificent wealth. It had taken only a few minutes, apparently, to change him from an English nobleman into a penniless little impostor, with no right to any of the splendors he had been enjoying. And, surprising as it may appear, it did not take nearly so long a time as one might have expected, to alter the face of everything again and to give back to him all that he had been in danger of losing.

It took the less time because, after all, the woman who had called herself Lady Fauntleroy was not nearly so clever as she was wicked; and when she had been closely pressed by Mr. Havisham's questions about her marriage and her boy, she had made one or two blunders which had caused suspicion to be awakened; and then she had lost her presence of mind and her temper, and in her excitement and anger had betrayed herself still further. All the mistakes she made were about her child. There seemed no doubt that she had been married to Bevis, Lord Fauntleroy, and had quarreled with him and had been paid to keep away from him; but Mr. Havisham found out that her story of the boy's being born in a certain part of London was false; and just when they all were in the midst of the commotion caused by this discovery, there came the letter from the young lawyer in New York, and Mr. Hobbs's letters also.

What an evening it was when those letters arrived, and when Mr. Havisham and the Earl sat and talked their plans over in the library!

"After my first three meetings with her," said Mr. Havisham, "I began to suspect her strongly. It appeared to me that the child was older than she said he was, and she made a slip in speaking of the date of his birth and then tried to patch the matter up. The story these letters bring fits in with several of my suspicions. Our best plan will be to cable at once for these two Tiptons,—say nothing about them to her,—and suddenly confront her with them when she is not expecting it. She is only a very clumsy plotter, after all. My opinion is that she will be frightened out of her wits, and will betray herself on the spot."

And that was what actually happened. She was told nothing, and Mr. Havisham kept her from suspecting anything by continuing to have interviews with her, in which he assured her he was investigating her statements; and she really began to feel so secure that her spirits rose immensely and she began to be as insolent as might have been expected.

But one fine morning, as she sat in her sitting-room at the inn called "The Dorincourt Arms," making some very fine plans for herself, Mr. Havisham was announced; and when he entered, he was followed by no less than three persons—one was a sharp-faced boy and one was a big young man and the third was the Earl of Dorincourt.

She sprang to her feet and actually uttered a cry of terror. It broke from her before she had time to check it. She had thought of these new-comers as being thousands of miles away, when she had ever thought of them at all, which she had scarcely done for years. She had never expected to see them again. It must be confessed that Dick grinned a little when he saw her.

"Hello, Minna!" he said.

The big young man—who was Ben—stood still a minute and looked at her.

"Do you know her?" Mr. Havisham asked, glancing from one to the other.

"Yes," said Ben. "I know her and she knows me." And he turned his back on her and went and stood looking out of the window, as if the sight of her was hateful to him, as indeed it was. Then the woman, seeing herself so baffled and exposed, lost all control over herself and flew into such a rage as Ben and Dick had often seen her in before. Dick grinned a trifle more as he watched her and heard the names she called them all and the violent threats she made, but Ben did not turn to look at her.

"I can swear to her in any court," he said to Mr. Havisham, "and I can bring a dozen others who will. Her father is a respectable sort of man, though he's low down in the world. Her mother was just like herself. She's dead, but he's alive, and he's honest enough to be ashamed of her. He'll tell you who she is, and whether she married me or not."

Then he clenched his hand suddenly and turned on her.

"Where's the child?" he demanded. "He's going with me! He is done with you, and so am I!"

And just as he finished saying the words, the door leading into the bedroom opened a little, and the boy, probably attracted by the sound of the loud voices, looked in. He was not a handsome boy, but he had rather a nice face, and he was quite like Ben, his father, as any one could see, and there was the three-cornered scar on his chin.

Ben walked up to him and took his hand, and his own was trembling.

"Yes," he said, "I could swear to him, too. Tom," he said to the little fellow, "I'm your father; I've come to take you away. Where's your hat?"

The boy pointed to where it lay on a chair. It evidently rather pleased him to hear that he was going away. He had been so accustomed to queer experiences that it did not surprise him to be told by a stranger that he was his father. He objected so much to the woman who had come a few months before to the place where he had lived since his babyhood, and who had suddenly announced that she was his mother, that he was quite ready for a change. Ben took up the hat and marched to the door.

"If you want me again," he said to Mr. Havisham,"you know where to find me."

He walked out of the room, holding the child's hand and not looking at the woman once. She was fairly raving with fury, and the Earl was calmly gazing at her through his eyeglasses, which he had quietly placed upon his aristocratic, eagle nose.

"Come, come, my young woman," said Mr. Havisham. "This won't do at all. If you don't want to be locked up, you really must behave yourself."

And there was something so very business-like in his tones that, probably feeling that the safest thing she could do would be to get out of the way, she gave him one savage look and dashed past him into the next room and slammed the door.

"We shall have no more trouble with her," said Mr. Havisham.

And he was right; for that very night she left the Dorincourt Arms and took the train to London, and was seen no more.

When the Earl left the room after the interview, he went at once to his carriage.

"To Court Lodge," he said to Thomas.

"To Court Lodge," said Thomas to the coachman as he mounted the box; "an' you may depend on it, things are taking a uniggspected turn."

When the carriage stopped at Court Lodge, Cedric was in the drawingroom with his mother.

The Earl came in without being announced. He looked an inch or so taller, and a great many years younger. His deep eyes flashed.

"Where," he said, "is Lord Fauntleroy?"

Mrs. Errol came forward, a flush rising to her cheek.

"Is it Lord Fauntleroy?" she asked. "Is it, indeed!"

The Earl put out his hand and grasped hers.

"Yes," he answered, "it is."

Then he put his other hand on Cedric's shoulder.

"Fauntleroy," he said in his unceremonious, authoritative way, "ask your mother when she will come to us at the Castle."

Fauntleroy flung his arms around his mother's neck.

"To live with us!" he cried. "To live with us always!"

The Earl looked at Mrs. Errol, and Mrs. Errol looked at the Earl.

His lordship was entirely in earnest. He had made up his mind to waste no time in arranging this matter. He had begun to think it would suit him to make friends with his heir's mother.

"Are you quite sure you want me?" said Mrs. Errol, with her soft, pretty smile.

"Quite sure," he said bluntly. "We have always wanted you, but we were not exactly aware of it. We hope you will come."





Chapter 15　His Eighth Birthday


Ben took his boy and went back to his cattle ranch in California, and he returned under very comfortable circumstances. Just before his going, Mr. Havisham had an interview with him in which the lawyer told him that the Earl of Dorincourt wished to do something for the boy who might have turned out to be Lord Fauntleroy, and so he had decided that it would be a good plan to invest in a cattle ranch of his own, and put Ben in charge of it on terms which would make it pay him very well, and which would lay a foundation for his son's future. And so when Ben went away, he went as the prospective master of a ranch which would be almost as good as his own, and might easily become his own in time, as indeed it did in the course of a few years; and Tom, the boy, grew up on it into a fine young man and was devotedly fond of his father; and they were so successful and happy that Ben used to say that Tom made up to him for all the troubles he had ever had.

But Dick and Mr. Hobbs—who had actually come over with the others to see that things were properly looked after—did not return for some time. It had been decided at the outset that the Earl would provide for Dick, and would see that he received a solid education; and Mr. Hobbs had decided that as he himself had left a reliable substitute in charge of his store, he could afford to wait to see the festivities which were to celebrate Lord Fauntleroy's eighth birthday. All the tenantry were invited, and there were to be feasting and dancing and games in the park, and bonfires and fire-works in the evening.

"Just like the Fourth of July!" said Lord Fauntleroy. "It seems a pity my birthday wasn't on the Fourth, doesn't it? For then we could keep them both together."

It must be confessed that at first the Earl and Mr. Hobbs were not as intimate as it might have been hoped they would become, in the interests of the British aristocracy. The fact was that the Earl had known very few grocery-men, and Mr. Hobbs had not had many very close acquaintances who were earls; and so in their rare interviews conversation did not flourish. It must also be owned that Mr. Hobbs had been rather overwhelmed by the splendors Fauntleroy felt it his duty to show him.

The entrance gate and the stone lions and the avenue impressed Mr. Hobbs somewhat at the beginning, and when he saw the Castle, and the flower-gardens, and the hot-houses, and the terraces, and the peacocks, and the dungeon, and the armor, and the great staircase, and the stables, and the liveried servants, he really was quite bewildered. But it was the picture gallery which seemed to be the finishing stroke.

"Somethin' in the manner of a museum?" he said to Fauntleroy, when he was led into the great, beautiful room.

"N—no—!" said Fauntleroy, rather doubtfully. "I don't THINK it's a museum. My grandfather says these are my ancestors."

"Your aunt's sisters!" ejaculated Mr. Hobbs. "ALL of 'em? Your greatuncle, he MUST have had a family! Did he raise 'em all?"

And he sank into a seat and looked around him with quite an agitated countenance, until with the greatest difficulty Lord Fauntleroy managed to explain that the walls were not lined entirely with the portraits of the progeny of his great-uncle.

He found it necessary, in fact, to call in the assistance of Mrs. Mellon, who knew all about the pictures, and could tell who painted them and when, and who added romantic stories of the lords and ladies who were the originals. When Mr. Hobbs once understood, and had heard some of these stories, he was very much fascinated and liked the picture gallery almost better than anything else; and he would often walk over from the village, where he staid at the Dorincourt Arms, and would spend half an hour or so wandering about the gallery, staring at the painted ladies and gentlemen, who also stared at him, and shaking his head nearly all the time.

"And they was all earls!" he would say, "er pretty nigh it! An' HE'S goin' to be one of 'em, an' own it all!"

Privately he was not nearly so much disgusted with earls and their mode of life as he had expected to be, and it is to be doubted whether his strictly republican principles were not shaken a little by a closer acquaintance with castles and ancestors and all the rest of it. At any rate, one day he uttered a very remarkable and unexpected sentiment:

"I wouldn't have minded bein' one of 'em myself!" he said—which was really a great concession.

What a grand day it was when little Lord Fauntleroy's birthday arrived, and how his young lordship enjoyed it! How beautiful the park looked, filled with the thronging people dressed in their gayest and best, and with the flags flying from the tents and the top of the Castle! Nobody had staid away who could possibly come, because everybody was really glad that little Lord Fauntleroy was to be little Lord Fauntleroy still, and some day was to be the master of everything. Every one wanted to have a look at him, and at his pretty, kind mother, who had made so many friends. And positively every one liked the Earl rather better, and felt more amiably toward him because the little boy loved and trusted him so, and because, also, he had now made friends with and behaved respectfully to his heir's mother. It was said that he was even beginning to be fond of her, too, and that between his young lordship and his young lordship's mother, the Earl might be changed in time into quite a well-behaved old nobleman, and everybody might be happier and better off.

What scores and scores of people there were under the trees, and in the tents, and on the lawns! Farmers and farmers' wives in their Sunday suits and bonnets and shawls; girls and their sweethearts; children frolicking and chasing about; and old dames in red cloaks gossiping together. At the Castle, there were ladies and gentlemen who had come to see the fun, and to congratulate the Earl, and to meet Mrs. Errol. Lady Lorredaile and Sir Harry were there, and Sir Thomas Asshe and his daughters, and Mr. Havisham, of course, and then beautiful Miss Vivian Herbert, with the loveliest white gown and lace parasol, and a circle of gentlemen to take care of her—though she evidently liked Fauntleroy better than all of them put together. And when he saw her and ran to her and put his arm around her neck, she put her arms around him, too, and kissed him as warmly as if he had been her own favorite little brother, and she said:

"Dear little Lord Fauntleroy! dear little boy! I am so glad! I am so glad!"

And afterward she walked about the grounds with him, and let him show her everything. And when he took her to where Mr. Hobbs and Dick were, and said to her, "This is my old, old friend Mr. Hobbs, Miss Herbert, and this is my other old friend Dick. I told them how pretty you were, and I told them they should see you if you came to my birthday,"—she shook hands with them both, and stood and talked to them in her prettiest way, asking them about America and their voyage and their life since they had been in England; while Fauntleroy stood by, looking up at her with adoring eyes, and his cheeks quite flushed with delight because he saw that Mr. Hobbs and Dick liked her so much.

"Well," said Dick solemnly, afterward, "she's the daisiest gal I ever saw! She's—well, she's just a daisy, that's what she is, 'n' no mistake!"

Everybody looked after her as she passed, and every one looked after little Lord Fauntleroy. And the sun shone and the flags fluttered and the games were played and the dances danced, and as the gayeties went on and the joyous afternoon passed, his little lordship was simply radiantly happy.

The whole world seemed beautiful to him.

There was some one else who was happy, too,—an old man, who, though he had been rich and noble all his life, had not often been very honestly happy. Perhaps, indeed, I shall tell you that I think it was because he was rather better than he had been that he was rather happier. He had not, indeed, suddenly become as good as Fauntleroy thought him; but, at least, he had begun to love something, and he had several times found a sort of pleasure in doing the kind things which the innocent, kind little heart of a child had suggested, —and that was a beginning. And every day he had been more pleased with his son's wife. It was true, as the people said, that he was beginning to like her too. He liked to hear her sweet voice and to see her sweet face; and as he sat in his arm-chair, he used to watch her and listen as she talked to her boy; and he heard loving, gentle words which were new to him, and he began to see why the little fellow who had lived in a New York side street and known grocery-men and made friends with boot-blacks, was still so well-bred and manly a little fellow that he made no one ashamed of him, even when fortune changed him into the heir to an English earldom, living in an English castle.

It was really a very simple thing, after all,—it was only that he had lived near a kind and gentle heart, and had been taught to think kind thoughts always and to care for others. It is a very little thing, perhaps, but it is the best thing of all. He knew nothing of earls and castles; he was quite ignorant of all grand and splendid things; but he was always lovable because he was simple and loving. To be so is like being born a king.

As the old Earl of Dorincourt looked at him that day, moving about the park among the people, talking to those he knew and making his ready little bow when any one greeted him, entertaining his friends Dick and Mr. Hobbs, or standing near his mother or Miss Herbert listening to their conversation, the old nobleman was very well satisfied with him. And he had never been better satisfied than he was when they went down to the biggest tent, where the more important tenants of the Dorincourt estate were sitting down to the grand collation of the day.

They were drinking toasts; and, after they had drunk the health of the Earl, with much more enthusiasm than his name had ever been greeted with before, they proposed the health of "Little Lord Fauntleroy." And if there had ever been any doubt at all as to whether his lordship was popular or not, it would have been settled that instant. Such a clamor of voices, and such a rattle of glasses and applause! They had begun to like him so much, those warm-hearted people, that they forgot to feel any restraint before the ladies and gentlemen from the castle, who had come to see them. They made quite a decent uproar, and one or two motherly women looked tenderly at the little fellow where he stood, with his mother on one side and the Earl on the other, and grew quite moist about the eyes, and said to one another:

"God bless him, the pretty little dear!"

Little Lord Fauntleroy was delighted. He stood and smiled, and made bows, and flushed rosy red with pleasure up to the roots of his bright hair.

"Is it because they like me, Dearest?" he said to his mother. "Is it, Dearest? I'm so glad!"

And then the Earl put his hand on the child's shoulder and said to him:

"Fauntleroy, say to them that you thank them for their kindness."

Fauntleroy gave a glance up at him and then at his mother.

"Must I?" he asked just a trifle shyly, and she smiled, and so did Miss Herbert, and they both nodded. And so he made a little step forward, and everybody looked at him—such a beautiful, innocent little fellow he was, too, with his brave, trustful face! —and he spoke as loudly as he could, his childish voice ringing out quite clear and strong.

"I'm ever so much obliged to you!" he said, "and—I hope you'll enjoy my birthday—because I've enjoyed it so much—and—I'm very glad I'm going to be an earl; I didn't think at first I should like it, but now I do—and I love this place so, and I think it is beautiful—and—and—and when I am an earl, I am going to try to be as good as my grandfather."

And amid the shouts and clamor of applause, he stepped back with a little sigh of relief, and put his hand into the Earl's and stood close to him, smiling and leaning against his side.

And that would be the very end of my story; but I must add one curious piece of information, which is that Mr. Hobbs became so fascinated with high life and was so reluctant to leave his young friend that he actually sold his corner store in New York, and settled in the English village of Erlesboro, where he opened a shop which was patronized by the Castle and consequently was a great success. And though he and the Earl never became very intimate, if you will believe me, that man Hobbs became in time more aristocratic than his lordship himself, and he read the Court news every morning, and followed all the doings of the House of Lords! And about ten years after, when Dick, who had finished his education and was going to visit his brother in California, asked the good grocer if he did not wish to return to America, he shook his head seriously.

"Not to live there," he said. "Not to live there; I want to be near HIM, an' sort o' look after him. It's a good enough country for them that's young an' stirrin'—but there's faults in it. There's not an auntsister among 'em—nor an earl!"
