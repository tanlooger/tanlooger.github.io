第一章　海岛


从前有四个小孩，他们名叫彼得、苏珊、埃德蒙和露西，在《狮子，女巫与魔衣柜》这本书里，我们已经听说了他们的奇幻旅程。他们曾打开一个魔衣柜的柜门，进入了一个迥异于我们现实世界的奇幻世界。在那个神奇的世界里，他们当上了纳尼亚王国的国王和女王。尽管他们统治了纳尼亚很久很久，可当他们穿过那个柜门回到英格兰的时候，时间居然没有丝毫流逝。无论如何，没人留意到他们曾经离开过，因此，除了一个睿智的大人外，他们没对任何人讲述他们的经历。

那段经历已经是一年前的事情了，如今他们四个人正坐在火车站的长椅上，旁边堆放着他们的行李箱和玩具盒。事实上，他们正在回学校的路上。他们一块儿出发，要在这个中转车站分手；几分钟后会有一趟列车进站，将两个女孩带往她们的学校，半小时后另一辆列车将抵达，那两个男孩将乘车去往另一所学校。离家旅行的前半段，因为小伙伴们还待在一起，大家总觉得还在度假，但此刻就要分手各自上路，大家这才觉得假期真的过完了，开学的情绪开始弥漫起来。人人都情绪低落，什么话都不想说。露西这是头一次离家去上寄宿学校。

乡村车站空荡荡的，冷冷清清，站台上除了他们几个，再没别人了。突然，露西小声地尖叫了一声，就好像被马蜂给蛰到了。

“怎么啦，露西？”埃德蒙的话突然中断，“哎哟”叫了一声。

“到底——”彼得刚开口，也突然换了话头，转而叫起来，“苏珊，放手！干吗呢？你要拖我去哪里？”

“我碰都没碰你，”苏珊回应，“有人在拽我。哎呀，哎呀，住手！”

大家发现每个人的脸都吓白了。

“我也感觉到了，”埃德蒙喘息着说，“就好像有人在拽我。很吓人的拉拽——啊！又来了。”

“我也感觉到了，”露西叫起来，“哎哟，我受不了了。”

“当心！”埃德蒙喊道，“大家手拉手，别分开。这是魔法——我能感觉出来。快！”

“对，”苏珊也道，“快拉着手。天啊，但愿能停下来——啊！”

一瞬间，行李、长椅、站台和车站通通消失了。四个孩子，手拉着手，喘着气，发现他们现在正站在一个树木茂密的地方——树木如此密集，枝条几乎要扎入他们的身体，要挪动都很难。他们都擦了擦眼，深吸一口气。

“嗨，彼得！”露西惊呼，“我们是不是回到纳尼亚了？”

“这里可能是任何地方，”彼得答道，“到处是树，一码外的地方都看不到。我们得试着找个开阔地——要是真有空地的话。”

他们费了些劲，时不时地被荨麻和荆棘刺到，总算是从灌木丛里挣扎出来了。才刚出来又吃了一惊。外面亮堂多了，走了几步出了树林，面前是一片沙滩。几码开外，十分平静的大海用细浪轻抚着沙滩，柔和得几乎听不到海浪声。看不到陆地，天空无云。看太阳的位置，应该是早上十点钟的样子，大海蓝得耀眼。他们伫立着，嗅着大海的气息。

“老天！”彼得感叹，“这里还不错。”

五分钟后，四个人都光起脚，蹚着清澈清凉的海水玩耍。

“这要比待在闷热的火车里回学校啃拉丁语、法语和代数强多了！”埃德蒙感叹。大家很长时间都不再吭声，只是踩着哗啦啦的海水寻找虾蟹。

“不管怎么说，”苏珊一会儿说道，“我觉得我们该做点儿打算。我们很快就需要填饱肚子了。”

“我们带有妈妈给我们旅行准备的三明治，”埃德蒙说，“至少我的还在。”

“我的没了，留在我的小包里了。”露西说。

“我的也是。”苏珊说。

“我的在我的外套口袋里，在那边沙滩上，”彼得说，“四个人只有两份午餐。这可不妙。”

“现在，”露西说，“比起吃的来，我更想喝水。”

其他人都觉得有些渴了，在大太阳底下的海水里蹚久了都会有这反应。

“这就像落难荒岛，”埃德蒙叹道，“书里的主人公总能在荒岛上找到干净清澈的泉水。咱们最好去找找。”

“那是不是意味着我们还得走回刚才那片密林？”苏珊问道。

“不用，”彼得说，“要是岛上有溪流的话，肯定是要顺流流向大海的，我们只需要沿着海滩走，总能见到。”

他们从海里走上岸，走过湿润平滑的沙滩，走上干燥的沙层，沙粒沾在他们脚上，于是他们穿上了鞋袜。埃德蒙和露西打算把鞋袜留在沙滩上，赤脚去探险，苏珊告诉他们别做这样的傻事。“没准会弄丢的，”她提醒，“再说，要是还得待在这里的话，晚上会冷的，我们需要鞋袜。”

收拾好后，他们出发沿着海岸前行，左边是大海，右边是树林。除了偶尔几声海鸥的鸣叫，岛上很安静。树林茂密，树枝缠绕，里面几乎什么都看不到，而且树林里面也没有任何响动——没有鸟啼，甚至也没有虫鸣。

贝壳、海藻、海葵，以及岩石池里的小螃蟹等都挺好玩，可要是你渴得厉害，很快这些就引不起你的兴趣了。没有了清凉的海水，孩子们的脚变得沉重燥热。苏珊和露西还得扛着雨衣。魔法上身时，埃德蒙的外套留在了车站凳子上，他和彼得轮流拿着彼得的厚外套。

走了一会儿，海岸开始向右弯转。又走了一刻钟左右，翻过了一座礁石山脊——山脊一直向外延伸至海中——他们来到一个急弯处。到了这里，他们背对着从树林出来时见到的那片海，往前看去，见到对岸的另一片海岸，那岸上覆盖着密林，跟前面见到的树林一样茂密。

“我在想，那是一座岛吗，我们等会儿要上去吗？”露西问。

“不清楚。”彼得回答，大家沉默着艰难前行。

他们所行走的这片海岸离对面的海岸越来越近，每次拐过海角时，总让人觉得要来到它们的连接处了，可每次他们都失望了。他们来到几块礁石前，爬了过去，在礁石顶上望着前方的水路。“见鬼！”埃德蒙说，“没用的。我们根本没法到对岸的那片树林。我们是在一个岛上！”

他说对了。他们所站的地方与对岸隔着一道三四十码宽的海峡；但看得出来，这海峡是两岸距离最近的地方了。从这里开始，他们这头的海岸又向右转弯，那里与对岸的陆地隔着汪洋大海。很显然，他们已经绕着这个岛转了大半圈了。

“看！”露西突然叫了起来，“那是什么？”手指着一条横跨海滩的长长的、银色的蛇一样的东西。

“一条小溪！一条小溪！”其他人都嚷了起来，尽管累极了，他们还是马上喧闹着爬下礁石，冲向淡水。他们懂得，离沙滩越远，越是上游的溪水才越好喝，所以都跑到树林边上的流水口。树木依然那么茂密，溪流冲刷出很深的水道，两边的溪岸很高，满是青苔，只要弯下腰，就可以沿着水道往树林里走，头顶上的枝叶覆盖着的小路像条隧道。在第一个褐色水洼，他们跪了下来，喝个不停，然后将脸、前臂都泡在水里。

“喂，”埃德蒙说，“现在吃三明治好不好？”

“呃，最好还是不要吧？”苏珊说，“等后面更饿的时候再吃。”

露西说：“刚才渴的时候没感觉饿，现在解了渴，要是能继续像刚才那样不觉得饿就好了。”

“还是吃掉吧，好不好？”埃德蒙又念叨起来，“再舍不得吃就要放坏了。要知道这里可比英格兰炎热多了，再说我们把东西放在兜里走了好几个钟头了。”他们只好将两个小包裹拿出来，将东西分作四份，谁都没吃饱，但总比饿肚子强多了。吃完后他们商量下一餐该怎么办。露西原本还打算去海里捕虾，有人提醒没有网，只好作罢。埃德蒙提议在礁石上捡拾海鸥蛋，可当他们开始寻思的时候，又记起来刚才根本就没见过任何鸟蛋，就算有，也没法煮。彼得心想，要是运气不好，能吃上生蛋都得庆幸了，可他聪明地没把这丧气话说出来。苏珊说，这么早就把三明治给吃掉了，太可惜了。这一下有那么一两个人几乎当场就要哭起来了。最后埃德蒙说：

“听我说，我们只能这么办了。我们必须去树林里探险。隐者和游侠骑士之类的人总是能设法在森林里存活下来。他们能找到根茎、浆果之类的。”

“哪种根茎？”苏珊问。

“我还以为是指树根呢。”露西说。

“好了，”彼得说，“埃德说得对。我们得做点儿什么。总比走在外面晒大太阳强。”

他们站起身沿着溪流往树林里走。一路上很艰难。到处是枝条，他们得弯腰穿行，得攀爬，还踉踉跄跄地穿过一大片像是杜鹃花的灌木，衣服刮破了，脚踩在水里鞋子湿了；除了流水声和他们弄出的声响，周围一片寂静。他们都要累死了，这时闻到了一阵香气，在右岸上方，一道鲜艳的色彩闪过头顶。

“喂！”露西大喊，“我确信那是棵苹果树。”

还真是。他们激动地爬上陡峭的溪岸，穿过荆棘，来到一棵老果树前，那树上果实累累，金黄色的大苹果又脆又多汁。

“不止这一棵呢，”埃德蒙嘴里塞满了苹果，“看，到处都是。”

“哎呀，好几十棵呢，”苏珊第一个苹果刚吃完，一边扔果核一边又去摘第二个，“这里过去一定是个果园，很久很久以前，后来这个地方就荒芜了，灌木长了起来。”

“这么说，这岛上曾经有人居住。”彼得说。

“那是什么？”露西指着前方说道。

“天啊，那是一道墙，”彼得说，“老石墙。”

蹭着结满了果子的枝条，他们好不容易挤到墙边。墙很古老，多处坍塌，长满了青苔和桂竹香，墙体很高大，稍比那些最高的树木矮一些。等他们走近了，发现墙上有一个巨大的门拱，曾经里面肯定有过一道大门，但如今几乎被一棵棵繁茂的苹果树占满了。他们不得不弄断一些枝条才能走进去，这下日光猛然变得更强烈了，亮得他们眼睛直眨。他们发现自己在一处宽敞的开阔地，周边石墙环绕，没有树，只有平整的草地、雏菊、常春藤和灰墙。这里明亮，神秘，安静，又很悲凉。他们四人来到中间，很高兴总算能直起腰，尽情舒展四肢了。





第二章　古老的藏宝室


“这里原先不是花园，”过了一会儿苏珊说道，“这里曾经是一座城堡，这块地方以前肯定是城堡的庭院。”

“我懂你的意思，”彼得道，“没错，那里是塔楼的残垣。这里曾有一段台阶通往城墙顶。看另外那些石阶，又宽又矮的，是通往那个门口的，那里肯定曾有扇通往大厅的大门。”

“看那样子，很久远了。”埃德蒙道。

“对，很久以前了，”彼得道，“我真想知道是什么人曾住在这座城堡里，那是多久前。”

“这里让我觉得怪怪的。”露西道。

“露，你有这种感觉？”彼得转身盯着她说，“因为我也这么觉得。在今天这个古怪的日子里，这是让我感觉最怪异的地方。我在想我们这是在哪儿，这到底是怎么回事？”

他们一边说着话，一边走过庭院，穿过那道门来到曾是大厅的地方。如今这里跟院子一个模样，因为房子的屋顶早就没了，这里同样成了荒草和雏菊的天下，只是比外面窄小些，墙更高些。大厅的另一头有一个高出地面约三英尺的平台。

“我在想，这里曾经真是大厅吗？”苏珊道，“那个平台样子的是什么？”

“哎呀，你真笨，”彼得道，他莫名地激动起来，“你看不出来吗？那里曾经是摆放贵宾桌的高台，是国王和大贵族们坐的地方。大家会觉得你忘了从前，忘了我们曾经当过国王和女王，忘了从前在我们的大厅里我们也曾坐在像这样的台子上。”

“在我们的凯尔帕拉维尔城堡里，”苏珊接着道，语调里带着神往和悠扬，“在纳尼亚大河的河口边上。我怎么可能忘了呢？”

“那些日子历历在目！”露西道，“我们可以假装现在又回到了凯尔帕拉维尔。这个大厅原来的样子应该跟我们当年举办盛宴的大厅很像。”

“但可惜没了盛宴，”埃德蒙道，“要知道，天色晚了，看，影子都这么长了。你们没注意到现在没那么热了吗？”

“要是晚上在这里过夜的话，我们得生把火。”彼得道，“我带有火柴。我们去看能不能捡些干柴吧。”

大家都觉得有道理，紧接着忙碌了半小时。他们早先是穿过那个果园进到这片城堡废墟来的，但那个园子却不适合捡柴火。他们从一个小侧门走出大厅，来到城堡外的另一侧试试运气。从前的走廊和小房间如今都成了迷宫般的石丘或石穴，到处生着荨麻和野玫瑰。他们再往前走，见到城堡围墙上有一个很大的裂口，就钻了出去，来到了一片更阴暗高大的树林，那里有很多枯枝朽木、干枯的落叶和冷杉球果。他们来来回回搬了几捆柴火，在台子上堆了好大一堆。在搬第五趟的时候，他们发现了一口井，就在大厅外，给杂草遮蔽了，清除杂草后，见到的井水洁净、清爽、幽深。井的周围还残留着半圈的石子路。接着女孩们又出去采摘了些苹果，男孩们生火，火生在地台上，很靠近两墙的夹角处，他们觉得那个地方最舒适最暖和。他们点火时费了好大的劲儿，用了很多根火柴，但总算是大功告成。终于，四个人一起坐了下来，面朝着火，背对着墙。他们试着把苹果扎在树枝的一头烤着吃。但烤苹果不放糖不好吃，而且刚烤好的苹果烫得没法拿在手上，冷了又不想吃了。他们只好接着吃生苹果果腹。正如埃德蒙说的，这番折腾让他们意识到学校的饭食也不是那么难以下咽。他还加上一句：“现在要是能吃上厚厚一片涂了人造黄油的面包，我肯定不嫌弃。”但大伙儿冒险的心思正浓，没人真的想回到学校。

吃光苹果后，苏珊去外面的井里打水喝。回来时她手里拿着一样东西。

“瞧，”她哽咽着说道，“我在井边找到这个。”她把东西递给彼得，坐了下来。其他人觉得她的神色和语气像是要哭起来。埃德蒙、露西急切地向前探身看彼得手里的东西，那是一个色彩鲜艳的小东西，在火光下发着光。

“哦，我——我太吃惊了。”彼得道，他的声音也古怪起来。他把那东西递给其他人看。

大家都看出来了，那是一枚骑士棋子，普通大小，但很重，因为是纯金打造的，马眼是两粒小红宝石，或者说有只眼是，因为另一只眼上的已经遗失了。

“哎呀！”露西叫起来，“这跟我们以前常玩的黄金棋子一模一样，那时我们还是凯尔帕拉维尔的国王和女王。”

“打起精神来，苏。”彼得对他另一个妹妹说道。

“我情不自禁，”苏珊道，“它让我想起了——哦，那些好时光。想起了跟羊人、善良的巨人下棋的时候，想起了海里唱歌的人鱼，想起了我美丽的战马，还有，还有……”

“好了，”彼得的声音听起来跟平时不一样，“我们四个该用用脑子了。”

“干吗？”埃德蒙问道。

“你们就没人猜到我们现在在什么地方吗？”彼得问。

“继续，继续，”露西道，“我老觉得这个地方有一种奇妙的神秘感。”

“继续说，彼得，”埃德蒙道，“我们都听着。”

“我们现在就站在凯尔帕拉维尔的废墟上。”彼得道。

“哎呀，”埃德蒙道，“你是如何看出来的？这里都已经废弃很久了。看，那些大树都长到大门上了。看看这些石头。谁都能看出来这里已经荒废了有几百年了。”

“我知道，”彼得道，“这是一个谜。但先不去管它。我给你们一一解释。首先，这个大厅在形状和大小上跟凯尔帕拉维尔的那个一模一样。想象一下，这里加上一个屋顶，这里不是草地而是一条彩色通道，墙上加上挂毯，这样你就能看出这是我们的皇室宴会厅。”

大家沉默了。

“第二点，”彼得继续说着，“这个城堡的水井跟我们以前的水井一个方位，略靠大厅的南面，水井的形状和大小都是一样的。”

大家还是沉默。

“第三点，苏珊刚才找到了一枚我们以前的象棋棋子，或者说，那跟我们从前的一模一样。”

还是没人吭声。

“第四点，难道你们忘了吗，那是卡罗门国王派来专使的前一天，在凯尔帕拉维尔的北门外种下了果树，你们不记得了吗？最伟大的树精，果树女神，亲自来给果园施了赐福魔法。挖树坑的是那些正直的小家伙，那些鼹鼠。你们怎能忘了风趣的老莉莉格拉夫斯，那个鼹鼠首领，他当时倚着铲子说：‘相信我，陛下，总有一天您会因为这些果树而感到庆幸的。’老天，被他说中了。”

“我记得！我记得！”露西拍着手说。

“听我说，彼得，”埃德蒙说，“你肯定是胡扯。首先，我们没把果树紧挨着大门种。我们不会这么傻。”

“是的，当然不会，”彼得说，“果树是后来长到大门上去的。”

“再说了，”埃德蒙说，“凯尔帕拉维尔当时不是在岛上。”

“没错，我一直在琢磨这个。但当时那地方，怎么说呢，是一个半岛。差不多是一座岛。难道在我们走后它就不能变成一座岛吗？有人挖了一道海峡。”

“可是，等等！”埃德蒙说，“你老是说‘自从我们离开以后’。但我们从纳尼亚离开不过是一年前的事。你想要证明，在一年时间里，城堡就塌了，茂密的森林长了出来，当时我们亲眼看见栽种的小树变成了巨大的老果园，天晓得还有什么怪事。这根本不可能。”

“还有，”露西说，“要是这里是凯尔帕拉维尔，台子的这一头应该有一扇门。实际上，我们现在就该背对着那门坐着。你们知道的，那是通往地下藏宝室的门。”

“我不认为这里有门。”彼得边起身，边说着。

他们身后的墙上爬满了常春藤。

“我们很快就能弄明白。”埃德蒙说着从柴火堆里捡起一根木棍。他开始敲击被常春藤覆盖的墙。木棍敲击石头的嗒嗒声响起。嗒嗒，嗒嗒，然后，忽然地，砰砰，声音变了，一种沉闷的木质声响。

“天啊！”埃德蒙道。

“我们必须清理掉这些常春藤。”彼得道。

“哎呀，还是别理了，”苏珊说，“我们可以早上再弄。既然不得不在这里过夜，我可不想自己身后的门洞开着，一个大黑洞，任何东西都可能从那里跑出来，更别提那穿堂风和湿气了。很快天就要黑了。”

“苏珊！你怎能这样？”露西责备地看了她一眼。而那两个男孩则太激动了，根本不理会苏珊的提议。他们用手，用彼得的小折刀同常春藤奋战着，刀子弄断后，接着用埃德蒙的小刀。很快他们刚才坐的地方都堆满了藤蔓，那道门终于露了出来。

“上锁了，那是理所当然的。”彼得说。

“可木头完全腐朽了，”埃德蒙说，“我们很快就能把它拆掉，还能当柴火用。快干。”

花的时间比预计的要长，在完工前，大厅已变暗了，头顶的天空出现了一两颗星星。男孩们站在一堆碎木头上，搓着手上的泥，凝视着他们刚刚弄出来的空洞，那洞冰冷、黑暗，不止苏珊一个人微微战栗。

“现在点上火把。”彼得说。

“噢，有什么用呢？”苏珊说，“正如埃德蒙刚才说的……”

“我现在不那么说了，”埃德蒙打断道，“我还是很困惑，但很快就能弄明白。我想，你会下去吧，彼得？”

“我们必须去，”彼得说，“振作起来，苏珊。既然我们回到了纳尼亚，孩子气的行为是没用的。在这里你是一个女王。再说，不管怎样，有这样的谜团在心里困扰着，没人能睡得着。”

他们试了几次用长木棍做火把，但没成功。要是把点着的那一端举在上方，火把很快就会熄灭，要是倒着拿，又会烫着手，熏了眼。最后，他们只得用上埃德蒙的手电筒；幸亏那是不到一星期前的生日礼物，电池还几乎是新的。埃德蒙开路，手里拿着手电。露西紧随着，然后是苏珊，彼得殿后。

“我来到楼梯顶端了。”埃德蒙说。

“数数有几级台阶。”彼得说。

“一，二，三。”埃德蒙一边小心翼翼地往下走，一边这样数着，数到了十六。“到底了。”他朝后喊道。

“看来这真的是凯尔帕拉维尔了，”露西说，“那时就是十六级台阶。”他们不再说话，直到四个人都站在了楼梯底的拐角处。埃德蒙缓缓地将手电四处照射。

“哇——”四个孩子同时发出惊叹。

此刻他们都明白了，这里确实是凯尔帕拉维尔城堡里那古老的藏宝室，他们曾作为纳尼亚的国王和女王统治过这里。房子的中间留着一条通道（有点儿像温室的做法），两侧每间隔一段距离，都立着几套神气的盔甲，像是守护财宝的骑士。通道两侧的盔甲之间是一层层的架子，上面堆满了宝物——项链、臂环、指环、黄金碗碟、一根根长象牙、金质的胸针、头冠和链子、一堆堆未镶嵌的宝石，像石弹珠或土豆似的堆放着——有钻石、红宝石、蓝宝石、翡翠、黄玉，还有紫水晶。架子下放着铁条加固的大橡木箱，挂锁牢牢地锁着。这里冷得刺骨，静得能听到自己的呼吸声，宝物都蒙着灰尘，要不是他们知晓了所在之地，还记得其中大多数宝藏，恐怕他们也不会知道那些是珍宝。这个地方有些凄凉，有点儿瘆人，因为一切显得那么荒芜，那么久远。因此，至少有那么一分钟，大家都默默无言。

然后，很自然地，他们开始四处走动，拿起东西查看。这就像是故友重逢。要是你当时在场，就能听到他们诸如此类的话语：“哦，看啊！我们的加冕戒指，还记得第一次戴的情景吗？哎呀，这个小胸针我们都以为弄丢了呢。喂，那不是你在孤独岛上参加锦标赛时穿的盔甲吗？还记得小矮人为我做了这样的东西吗？还记得我们用那个号角来喝酒吗？还记得吗，还记得吗？”

埃德蒙忽然说：“听我说，咱们别浪费电池了，天知道还得用多少次呢。是不是最好先带上我们需要的东西出去再说？”

“我们一定要拿上那些礼物。”彼得说。因为很久以前在纳尼亚过圣诞时，他、苏珊，还有露西获赠了某些礼物，他们把那些礼物看得比他们整个王国还重要。埃德蒙没有礼物，因为当时他没跟他们在一起。（这得怪他自己，你可在前一本书里读到此事。）

他们都赞成彼得的提议，沿着通道来到藏宝室尽头的墙边，果然，那里还悬挂着那些礼物。露西的礼物是最小的，只是一个小小的瓶子。不过，瓶子不是玻璃而是钻石打造的，还剩有大半瓶魔药，几乎可以治好所有的伤口和疾病。露西不说话，神情郑重地把她的礼物取下来，把皮带挎在肩膀上，再次感受到药瓶在她身侧，她过去也是这样将它挂在身边的。苏珊的礼物是弓箭和号角。弓还在，还有象牙箭筒，里面装满了箭羽齐整的箭，可……“哎呀，苏珊，”露西问，“号角哪去了？”

“呀，见鬼，见鬼，见鬼，”苏珊想了一会儿说，“我想起来了。在纳尼亚的最后一天，我带着号角，当时我们在追猎白牡鹿。一定是我们误打误撞回到英格兰的时候弄丢的。”

埃德蒙吹了声口哨。这真是一个惨痛的损失，因为那是一个被施了魔法的号角，无论你何时吹响它，不管你人在哪儿，援助一定会来到你身边。

“恰恰是在这样一个地方迟早用得上的东西。”埃德蒙说。

“别担心，”苏珊说，“我还有这把弓呢。”她拿起弓来。

“弓弦没有老化吗，苏？”彼得问。

不知是由于藏宝室的空气里有些魔力，还是其他原因，弓仍能正常使用。苏珊擅长射箭和游泳。她立刻掰了掰弓，然后轻轻拨了一下弦。它发出嘣的一声响，清脆的拨弦声在房间里回响着。比起刚刚经历的事，这小小的一声响给孩子们带回了更多对往昔的回忆。所有那些战役、狩猎和盛宴纷纷涌入了他们的脑海。

苏珊把弦松开，把箭筒挂在身侧。

接着，彼得拿下他的礼物——刻有神气的红毛狮子的盾牌和王室之剑。他吹了吹气，把盾牌和剑在地板上敲了敲，震落灰尘。他把盾牌扣在胳膊上，把剑挂在身侧。起先他担心剑生锈，与剑鞘卡在一起。但没这回事。他快速地拔出剑，举了起来，剑在手电光下闪闪发亮。

“这是我的林登宝剑，”他说，“我用它杀死了巨狼。”他的语气变了，其他人都觉得他真的又成了至尊王彼得。停留了一会儿，大家才都记起来他们得节省电池。

他们爬上楼梯，生好火，躺了下来，互相紧紧依偎着取暖。地板很硬，很不舒服，可他们最终还是睡着了。





第三章　矮人


睡在户外最令人难受的就是你醒得过早。醒了就不得不起来，因为地板实在硬得让人难受。要是除了苹果早饭什么都吃不上，而前一晚的晚餐除了苹果什么也没得吃的话，境况就会更糟。当露西说，这是一个美好的早晨，虽然的确如此，大家还是说不出其他好话。埃德蒙说出了大家的心声：“我们真得离开这座岛。”

喝了井水，泼水洗脸后，他们又顺着溪流来到海岸，看着将他们与大陆分隔开来的海峡。

“我们得游过去。”埃德蒙说。

“对苏来说没问题，”彼得说（苏珊曾在学校的游泳比赛中两次获奖），“可其他人我就不确定了。”他说的“其他人”实际上是指埃德蒙和露西，埃德蒙在学校泳池里还游不了一个来回，而露西几乎不会游泳。

“不管怎么说，”苏珊说，“可能有海潮。爸爸说在不熟悉的地方游泳是不明智的。”

“可是，彼得，”露西说，“听我说。我知道我在家时根本不会游泳，我是说在英格兰。但很久以前，如果是很久以前的话，我们不是都会游吗，那时我们是纳尼亚的国王和女王？那时我们还能骑马，能做各种事情。你不觉得……？”

“噢，但那时我们差不多是大人。”彼得说，“我们统治了很多很多年，学会做很多事。现在我们不是又回到我们的正常年纪了吗？”

“啊！”埃德蒙的声调让其他人都住了嘴听他说。

“我刚刚都想明白了。”他说。

“明白什么啦？”彼得问。

“哎呀，整件事，”埃德蒙说，“你们知道的，就是我们昨晚一直困惑不解，为什么我们离开纳尼亚不过一年时间，但一切都显示凯尔帕拉维尔似乎已经荒芜了几百年？哦，你们还不明白吗？你们知道的，不管我们在纳尼亚生活多久，可当我们穿过衣柜返回时，时间似乎根本没有流逝。”

“继续说，”苏珊说，“我想我开始有些明白了。”

“那就意味着，”埃德蒙继续道，“一旦离开了纳尼亚，我们就不会知道纳尼亚时间是怎么走的。怎么就不能在纳尼亚时间过去了几百年，而在英格兰我们的时间仅过去了一年？”

“天啊，埃德蒙，”彼得说，“我相信你解开了谜团。从这个意义上来看，我们在凯尔帕拉维尔生活是几百年前的事了。如今我们又回到了纳尼亚，就像是十字军骑士，或是盎格鲁-撒克逊人，或是古代的布立吞人来到现代的英格兰一样。”

“见到我们他们得有多高兴啊……”露西才开口，但这时其他人都出声道“嘘！”或者“看！”眼下有了新情况。

他们右侧不远的陆地上有一个树木覆盖的地方，他们都觉得河口在那个地方的另一头。此刻，那地方的拐角处，出现了一艘小船。小船驶离那里后，转向沿着海峡朝他们驶来。船上有两个人，一个人划船，另一个人坐在船尾，抱着一捆东西，那东西抽搐扭动着，似乎是个活物。那两个人看上去是士兵。他们头戴钢盔，穿着轻便的锁子甲外衣。他们脸上有胡子，面目冷酷。孩子们从沙滩上退回树林，一动不动地观察。

“就是这里了。”船尾的士兵说，这时船来到了他们的对面。

“下士，要不要在他的脚上绑块石头？”另一个停下划桨问道。

“别胡说！”对方吼道，“我们不需要那样，再说我们也没带石头。只要我们把绳子绑好，就算没石头他也能很快被淹死。”他边说边站了起来，举起那捆东西。彼得现在看清楚那东西是活的了，实际上是一个矮人，手脚都给捆住了，正死命挣扎着。下一刻他听到耳边砰的一声响，那士兵突然举起了双手，矮人跌入了舱底，士兵随之落水。士兵挣扎着游回远处的岸边，彼得知道是苏珊的箭射中了他的头盔。他转身看到她脸色苍白，正把第二支箭拉到弦上。但没用上。一看到同伴落水，另一个士兵大叫了一声，从船的另一头跳入水中，也挣扎着游了回去（水正好没过他头顶），逃进了陆地上的树林里。

“快！别让船漂走！”彼得大喊。他和苏珊，衣服也没脱就跳入水中，在水还没漫过他们肩膀的时候，他们的手搭上了船舷。他们几秒中就把船拖到岸边，把矮人抬了出来，埃德蒙接着忙着用小刀割断捆绳。（彼得的剑肯定会更锋利，但做这样的工作很不方便，因为你只能握着剑柄，无法抓住剑刃。）矮人总算是脱困了，他坐起来，搓着手脚，惊叫起来：

“哎呀，不管他们怎么说，你们感觉不像是鬼魂。”

跟大多数的矮人一样，他矮壮结实，胸肌发达。要是直立的话，他身高大约三英尺，他的大胡子和粗糙的红色络腮胡须遮盖了他大半个脸，只露出一个鹰钩鼻和闪亮的黑眼睛。

“无论如何，”他继续道，“鬼魂与否，你们救了我的命，我非常感激你们。”

“可为什么我们就应该是鬼魂呢？”露西问。

“我一直听人们说，”矮人说道，“在海岸这一带树林，鬼魂多如树木。故事就是这么传的。这就是为什么，当他们想要除掉某人时，通常会把他带到这里来（就像他们刚才对付我一样），还传说他们会把他留给鬼魂。但我一直怀疑他们实际上是把那些人淹死了，或者割断了喉咙。我从来都不怎么相信鬼魂之说。但你们刚才射中的那两个胆小鬼完全相信。比起让我自生自灭，他们更害怕带我来死地。”

“噢，”苏珊说，“原来这是他们刚才溜掉的原因。”

“嗯？怎么回事？”矮人问道。

“他们逃走了，”埃德蒙说，“回到了陆地上。”

“我本就不打算射死他们，你们知道的。”苏珊说，她不愿意让人以为这么近的距离她都能射偏。

“嗯，”矮人说，“这可不太妙。这意味着以后会有麻烦。除非他们为了自己的利益闭口不谈。”

“他们为什么要淹死你呢？”彼得问。

“啊，我是一个危险的罪犯，我确实是，”矮人欢快地说，“故事说来就长了。眼下，我在想你们也许要请我吃早饭？你们不会明白要被处决会让我胃口大开。”

“只有苹果。”露西郁闷地说。

“聊胜于无，但没有鲜鱼来得诱人，”矮人说，“看来反倒是要我请你们吃早点了。刚才见到那船上有些渔具。不管怎样，我们必须把船划到岛的另一侧。我可不想让陆地上的人来这边见到这艘船。”

“我早该想到这一点。”彼得说。

四个孩子和矮人来到水边，费了些劲推船离岸，然后爬了上去。矮人马上指挥起来。当然，桨对他来说太大了用不了，所以彼得划船，矮人引导他们沿着海峡先向北，然后向东绕过海角。从这里望去，孩子们能看到整条河流，及其附近的海湾、海岬。他们觉得能认出某些地方，但自他们离开之后长出的树林让一切都变了模样。

当他们转入海岛东侧的大海时，矮人开始捕鱼。他们捞了很多鱼(1)，一种美丽彩虹色的鱼，他们都记得以前在凯尔帕拉维尔吃过。捕够了以后，他们把船划进一条小溪，系在一棵树上。矮人非常能干（确实，尽管有邪恶的矮人，可我从没听说过有哪个矮人是个傻子），他剖开鱼，收拾干净，然后说道：

“好了，我们接下来需要些柴火。”

“我们在城堡那里弄了些柴火。”埃德蒙说。

矮人低低地吹了声口哨。“哎哟喂！”(2)他说，“这里还真有城堡？”

“只剩下废墟了。”露西说。

矮人挨个盯着他们四个人看了一圈，脸上满是好奇。“到底是谁……？”他刚开头，但没说下去，接着道：“没关系。先吃早点。但在继续前先弄清一件事。你们能不能把手放在心口上跟我说，我确确实实活着？你们确定我没被淹死，我们完完全全都不是鬼魂？”

他们都向他做了保证，接下来的难题是怎么把鱼带走。他们没东西把鱼串起来，也没有篮子。他们最后只得用埃德蒙的帽子，因为其他人都没戴帽子。要不是现在饥肠辘辘，他肯定会闹上一场。

起先矮人在城堡里待得有些不自在。他不停地四处打量，东嗅西嗅，不停地说：“嗯。看起来还是有点儿阴森森的。闻起来也有鬼魂的气味。”但一到生火的时候，他开心起来，教他们如何在余火里烤鲜鱼。吃热乎乎的鱼却没有叉子，五个人只能轮流用一把小刀，这是件棘手事，一餐饭还没吃完，他们就被灼伤了好几根手指；但因为现在是上午九点钟，他们五点就起床了，所以没人像原来那样那么介意这些烫伤。大家喝了点儿井水，吃上一两个苹果后，这餐饭结束了。这时矮人拿出一个跟他手臂差不多粗的烟斗，填上，点着，喷出一大朵带着香气的烟，说道：“好了。”

“你先跟我们讲讲你的故事，”彼得说，“然后我们再给你讲我们的故事。”

“好吧，”矮人说，“既然你们救了我的命，那就听你们的吧。可我不知从何讲起。首先，我是凯斯宾国王的信使。”

“他是什么人？”四个人一同发问。

“凯斯宾十世，纳尼亚之王，愿他永远为王！”矮人答道，“就是说，他应该是纳尼亚之王，我们希望他将来能当上。现在他还只是我们这些老纳尼亚人的国王。”

“请问，老纳尼亚人是什么意思？”露西问道。

“噢，就是指我们。”矮人道，“我想，我们是某种反对派。”

“我明白了，”彼得说，“凯斯宾是老纳尼亚人的首领。”

“好吧，从某种意义上说，”矮人挠挠头说道，“但他现在是一个真正的新纳尼亚人，一个台尔马人，如果你听得懂的话。”

“我不明白。”埃德蒙说。

“比玫瑰战争还令人费解。”露西说。

“天啊，”矮人说，“我把你们弄糊涂了。听着：我觉得我应该从开头讲起，告诉你们凯斯宾如何在他叔叔的宫廷里成长，然后讲他是如何站到了我们这一边。但这个故事很长。”

“那更好了，”露西说，“我们喜欢听故事。”

因此，矮人静下来讲述他的故事。我不会用他的原话来向你们复述这个故事，添上所有孩子们的问话和打岔，因为那会花上很长的篇幅，而且会把人弄糊涂，即便这样，依然会遗漏一些关键点，而那些事情孩子们要以后才会了解到。下面所讲的是故事的主旨，正如他们最终所知晓的一样。

第四章　矮人讲述凯斯宾王子的故事


凯斯宾王子住在纳尼亚中央的一座大城堡里，跟他的叔叔、婶婶生活在一起，他的叔叔米亚兹是纳尼亚的国王，他的红发婶婶人称普鲁纳丽思米亚王后。他父母都已去世，凯斯宾最爱的人是他的保姆，尽管作为一个王子他拥有很多好玩的玩具，那些玩具除了说话外几乎什么都能干，可他最喜欢的还是睡前时光，那时候玩具都已放回到玩具柜子里，他的保姆会给他讲故事。

他不是很喜欢他的叔叔和婶婶，可他叔叔大约每周都会派人找他两次，两人会一起在城堡南侧的露台上来来回回地散步半个钟头。一天，当他们在散步时，国王对他说：

“好啦，孩子，很快我们就得教你骑马和剑术了。你知道，我和你婶婶没有孩子，看来等我死后你很可能会成为国王。你觉得怎样，嗯？”

“不知道，叔叔。”凯斯宾说。

“不知道，嗯？”米亚兹说，“怎么，我很想知道一个人除此之外还能期望什么其他东西！”

“尽管如此，我确实有愿望。”凯斯宾说。

“你有什么愿望？”国王问。

“我希望……我希望……我希望能生活在古代。”凯斯宾说道（他当时只是一个小男孩）。

此前国王米亚兹都是以一些成年人的令人生厌的方式说话，那些方式很清楚地表明他们对你说的东西并非真的感兴趣，但现在他突然用犀利的眼神看了凯斯宾一眼。

“嗯？什么意思？”他说，“你指什么样的古代？”

“噢，你不知道吗，叔叔？”凯斯宾说，“那时一切都很不一样。那时所有的动物都能说话，河流和林子里生活着善良的精灵，人们称之为水仙女和树精。那时有矮人。所有的树林里都有小巧可爱的羊人，他们长着山羊蹄子。还有……”

“那都是无稽之谈，骗小孩的，”国王严厉地说，“只有小孩子才信，听到了吗？你年龄不小了，不该听信这种鬼话。在你这个年纪，应该琢磨打仗和历险的事，而不是童话。”

“哦，那个时候也有战争和历险，”凯斯宾说，“神奇的历险。曾经有一个白女巫，她自封为整个国家的女王。她作法使得一年四季都是冬天。之后从某地来了两个男孩和两个女孩，他们杀死了女巫，当上了纳尼亚的国王和女王，他们的名字叫彼得、苏珊、埃德蒙和露西。从那以后，他们统治了纳尼亚很长时间，人人过得开心，这都要归功于阿斯兰……”

“他是谁？”米亚兹说。要是凯斯宾年龄再大些，听他叔叔的口吻，他会知趣地把嘴闭上。但他还继续唠叨着。

“噢，你不知道吗？”他说，“阿斯兰是来自海上的伟大狮子。”

“是谁一直给你灌输这些鬼话？”国王怒喝道。凯斯宾给吓到了，没吭声。

“殿下，”国王米亚兹松开了刚才一直牵着的凯斯宾的手，“我要你回答我。看着我。这些谎话是谁告诉你的？”

“保……保姆。”凯斯宾结巴地说，大哭起来。

“别嚎了，”他叔叔抓住凯斯宾的肩膀摇晃了他一下，“别哭了。别再让我听到你谈论——就是想也不行——这些愚蠢的故事。从来没有过那些国王和女王。怎么可能同时有两个国王？没有阿斯兰这个人。没有狮子这回事。也从来没有哪个时代的动物能说话。听到了吗？”

“听到了，叔叔。”凯斯宾抽泣着。

“那么，此事就到此为止。”国王说。他把远远站在露台另一头的侍臣叫来，冷淡地说：“把殿下送回房间，立刻把殿下的保姆给我找来。”




第二天凯斯宾发现他做的事有多糟，因为保姆被赶走了，甚至都没让她跟他告别，他被告知他将要有一个家庭教师。

凯斯宾很想念他的保姆，流了很多眼泪；他很伤心，因此比以往更惦记那些关于纳尼亚的古老传说了。他每天晚上都梦到小矮人和树精，努力让城堡里的猫狗跟他说话。但是那些狗只会摇尾巴，那些猫也只会发出咕噜声。

凯斯宾断定他会讨厌他的新家庭教师，大约一周后新老师来了，结果却发现是那种你没法不喜欢的人。他矮极了，又十分胖，凯斯宾从没见过这样的人。他的银白色胡须长长的，尖尖的，都长到他的腰部了。他的脸盘晒得黑黑的，满是皱纹，看起来很睿智，很丑陋，很和善。他的声音严肃，眼神欢快，以至于除非你很了解他，否则很难分辨他是在开玩笑，还是正严肃。他叫科涅利尔斯博士。

在科涅利尔斯博士教授的所有课程里，凯斯宾最喜欢的是历史。到目前为止，除了保姆的故事，他对纳尼亚的历史一无所知，他很吃惊地得知王室是这个国家的后来者。

“是王子殿下的祖先，凯斯宾一世，”科涅利尔斯博士说，“第一个征服了纳尼亚并建立了他的王国。是他把你们的民族带入这个国家。你们根本不是纳尼亚的原住民。你们都是台尔马人，也就是说，你们都来自台尔马地区，离西山很远的地方。这就是为什么凯斯宾一世被称为征服者凯斯宾。”

“请告诉我，博士，”一天凯斯宾问道，“在我们从台尔马来到这里之前，是什么人生活在纳尼亚？”

“在台尔马人占领它之前，没有人，或者说很少人，生活在纳尼亚。”科涅利尔斯博士说。

“那么我的高祖父被谁征服了呢？”

“是‘把谁征服了’，殿下，”科涅利尔斯博士说，“也许我们该由历史课转上语法课了。”

“噢，求你了，等一下！”凯斯宾说，“我的意思是，不是曾有过一场大战吗？要是没人跟他打仗，他为什么要叫作征服者凯斯宾呢？”

“我刚才说了，当时纳尼亚人很少。”博士说，透过他的大眼镜很古怪地看着这个小男孩。

凯斯宾困惑了一阵子，然后他的心猛地跳了一下。“你的意思是，”他倒吸了一口气，“当时有其他生物？你是说就跟故事一样？当时有……？”

“嘘！”科涅利尔斯博士把头挨近凯斯宾的脑袋，“一个字都别再提了。你不知道你的保姆就因为给你讲述古纳尼亚的事才被赶走的吗？国王不喜欢这样。要是他发现我跟你讲这些秘密，你要挨鞭子，而我会被砍头。”

“可为什么呢？”凯斯宾问道。

“我们现在该上语法课了，”科涅利尔斯博士高声说，“请殿下打开语法课本第四页的‘语法园地’，学习词形变化规则之趣味用法的内容。”

讲完这个后又学了名词和动词，一直学到午饭时间，我认为凯斯宾没听进去多少。他太激动了。他断定，科涅利尔斯博士要不是打算迟早跟他多透露些，就不会说那么多话了。

在这一点上他没有失望。几天后他的老师说：“今晚我打算给你上一堂天文学课。深夜时，两颗壮观的行星，塔瓦星和阿兰比尔星，将擦肩而过，相差不到一度。这两颗星交会两百年一遇，殿下有生之年不会再看到。你今晚最好比平时早点儿睡。快要交会时，我会去叫醒你。”

这事似乎跟古纳尼亚没有任何关联，古纳尼亚才是凯斯宾真正想了解的，但半夜起床总是有趣的，他还是有些高兴。那晚上床时，他起先觉得会睡不着；但他很快入睡，当有人将他轻轻摇醒，他感觉好像只睡了几分钟。

他起身坐在床上，看着满屋子的月光。科涅利尔斯博士穿着一件带兜帽的袍子，手里提一盏小灯，站在他的床边。凯斯宾马上记起他们要做的事情。他起床，穿上衣服。尽管是夏夜，但比他预想的冷，很高兴博士给他裹上了一件长袍，跟他自己所穿的一样，还给他套上一双暖和柔软的中统靴。过了一会儿，两人都包裹严实，这样在黑暗的走廊里不会被人看到，穿好鞋靴，走起路来几乎没声响，然后离开了房间。

凯斯宾跟着博士穿过许多走廊，走上几段楼梯，最后经过塔楼的一扇小门来到外面的平台上。平台的一侧是城垛，另一侧是陡峭的屋顶；下方是幽暗、闪着微光的城堡花园；头顶上是繁星和月亮。他们很快来到另一扇门，那门通向整个城堡雄伟的中央塔楼：科涅利尔斯博士打开了门锁，在黑暗中他们开始沿着楼梯盘旋而上。凯斯宾变得兴奋起来，以前他一直被禁止走上这道楼梯。

楼梯很长很陡，可当他们登上塔楼屋顶时，凯斯宾喘了口气，他觉得这趟辛苦很值得。右边的远处，他可以朦朦胧胧地看到西山。在他的左边能看到大河的微光，周围万籁俱寂，他能听到一英里外河狸坝那头瀑布的声响。这里很容易地就分辨出他们要观看的那两颗星星。它们低低地垂在天空的南端，明亮得像是两个月亮，挨得很近。

“它们会碰撞在一起吗？”他肃然起敬地问道。

“不会的，亲爱的王子，”他也悄声说着，“苍穹中伟大的星辰太了解它们运行的舞步，不会让这样的事情发生。好好地看着它们。它们的相遇会带来好运，这也预示着苦难的纳尼亚要有好运气了。胜利之神塔瓦星在向和平女神阿兰比尔星致敬。此时它们之间的距离最近。”

“很可惜那棵树挡住了视线，”凯斯宾说，“实际上我们从西塔那里可以看得更清楚，虽然那里不是很高。”

科涅利尔斯沉默了大约两分钟，静静地站着，注视着塔瓦星和阿兰比尔星。然后他深吸一口气，转向凯斯宾。

“好了，”他说，“你看到了别人没看到也不会再看到的景象。你是对的。从那个小一些的塔楼上我们会观测得更清楚。我把你带到这里来有别的原因。”

凯斯宾仰望着他，但博士的兜帽遮住了他大半张脸。

“这个塔楼的好处，”科涅利尔斯博士说，“就是我们下面有六个空房间，一段长长的楼梯，楼梯下的门是锁着的。不可能有人偷听我们。”

“你要告诉我你前几天不肯跟我说的事吗？”凯斯宾说。

“是的，”博士说，“但记住，你我只能在这里说这些话，在大塔楼的楼顶。”

“我会的。我保证，”凯斯宾说，“请继续说下去。”

“听着，”博士说，“你所听到的关于古纳尼亚的传说都是真的。那不是人类的国度。那是阿斯兰的国度，是有灵的树和肉眼可见的水仙子的国度，是农牧神和森林之神的国度，是矮人和巨人的国度，是精灵和马人的国度，是能言兽的国度。凯斯宾一世所对抗的就是这些生灵。是你们台尔马人让野兽、树木和山泉沉默，是你们杀死并赶走了矮人和羊人，现在还试图抹掉关于他们的记忆。国王不允许谈论他们。”

“啊，我真希望我们没这么干，”凯斯宾说，“我很高兴这些故事都是真的，哪怕都结束了。”

“你们很多族人希望把真相隐藏起来。”科涅利尔斯博士说。

“可是，博士，”凯斯宾说，“为什么你说是我的族人？毕竟，我想你也是一个台尔马人。”

“我是吗？”博士说。

“啊，不管怎么说你是人类。”凯斯宾说。

“是吗？”博士声音低沉地重复着，同时掀开了他的兜帽，这样凯斯宾能在月光下清楚地看到他的脸。

凯斯宾顿时恍然大悟，觉得自己早就应该意识到。科涅利尔斯博士如此矮小，如此肥胖，还留着这么长的胡须。他脑子里马上闪过两个念头。一个是恐惧的念头——“他不是一个真的人，根本就不是人类，他是一个矮人，他把我带到这里来是要杀掉我。”另一个是纯粹欢喜的念头——“这世上还有真实的矮人存在，我终于亲眼见到一个了。”

“你终于猜到了，”科涅利尔斯博士说，“或者说，你差不多猜对了。我不是一个纯种的矮人。我身上有人类的血统。很多矮人在大战中逃生并生存了下来，剃掉了胡须，穿上增高鞋，假扮人类。他们跟你们台尔马人混居。我是他们其中的一个，只是一个混血矮人，假如我的同类，那些真正的矮人，还生活在这个世上的某个地方的话，他们一定会鄙视我，称我为叛徒。但这些年来我们从未忘记我们自己的民族和纳尼亚其他所有幸福的精灵，以及丧失了很久的自由时光。”

“我……我很抱歉，博士，”凯斯宾说，“那不是我的错，你了解的。”

“我说这些不是要指责你，亲爱的王子，”博士答道，“你不妨问问我为什么要提这些事。我有两个原因。首先，因为我衰老的心脏承载这些秘密的回忆太久，我的心很痛苦，要是我不跟你倾诉，我的心会爆炸。第二个原因是，等你成为国王，你能帮助我们，因为我知道，你虽然是台尔马人，但也热爱古老的事物。”

“确实，确实，”凯斯宾说，“但我如何帮忙呢？”

“你可以善待矮人中那些可怜的幸存者，像我这样的。你可以召集博学的魔法师，想办法再次把树木唤醒。你可以遍寻这片土地的各个角落和荒野，看看是否还有羊人、能言兽，或者矮人藏身某处。”

“你觉得会有吗？”凯斯宾热切地问道。

“我不知道，我不知道，”博士深深叹了一口气，“有时我担心不会有了。我这辈子一直在寻找他们的踪迹。有时我觉得自己听到山里传来矮人的鼓声。有时在夜里，在树林里，我仿佛远远地瞥见羊人和羊怪在跳着舞；但当我走近，那里什么也没有。我经常感到绝望，但总有什么东西唤起我的希望。我不知道。但至少你可以努力成为像古代的至尊王彼得那样的国王，而不是像你的叔叔。”

“那么关于那些国王和女王的传说也是真的了，还有那个白女巫？”凯斯宾问道。

“当然是真的，”科涅利尔斯说，“他们统治期间是纳尼亚的黄金时代，这块土地从未忘记他们。”

“他们以前生活在这座城堡里吗，博士？”

“不，亲爱的，”老人说道，“这座城堡新建不久。你的高祖父建造的它。当阿斯兰让亚当的两个儿子和夏娃的两个女儿当上国王和女王时，他们住在凯尔帕拉维尔城堡里。还没人见过那神圣的地方，也许连那座城堡的废墟如今都已烟消云散了。但我们相信它远离这里，在大河河口处，在海岸边。”

“啊！”凯斯宾抖了抖，“你是说在黑森林里？那里是所有的……你知道的，鬼魂出没的地方。”

“殿下说的都是别人教给你的，”博士说，“但那都是谎言。那里没有鬼魂。台尔马人编了这个故事。你们的国王们非常惧惮大海，因为他们无法忘记，在所有的传说中，阿斯兰来自海上。他们不愿靠近大海，也不愿其他人靠近。因此他们任由丛林疯长，将他们的民众与海岸阻隔开来。因为他们跟树木发生过冲突，他们害怕那些树林。因为他们害怕树林，他们就幻想那里到处游荡着鬼魂。国王们和贵族们，由于憎恨大海和树林，对这些故事半自己相信半鼓励别人相信。如果没人敢到海岸，眺望阿斯兰的土地、朝阳和东边的世界，他们会感到很安心。”

两人沉默了几分钟。然后科涅利尔斯博士说：“嗨，我们在这里待得够久了。是时候上床睡觉了。”

“一定要吗？”凯斯宾说，“我愿意谈论这些事，谈多久都行。”

“要是我们这么做的话，可能有人要开始找我们了。”科涅利尔斯博士说。





第五章　凯斯宾山间历险


自那以后，凯斯宾和他的老师在大塔楼楼顶上多次进行秘密谈话，每一次交谈都增进了凯斯宾对古代纳尼亚的了解，他的闲暇时间几乎都花在了对往昔的怀念和憧憬，渴望老时光重现上。不过，当然啦，他的空闲时间不多，因为对他的教育已步入正轨。他学习击剑和骑马、游泳和潜水，学习如何射箭，如何吹奏竖笛、琉特琴，如何猎捕牡鹿、分解死鹿，除了学习宇宙学、修辞学、纹章学、诗律，当然还有历史，他还涉猎了法律、医学、炼金术和天文学。就魔法而言，他只学了理论，因为科涅利尔斯博士说，实际操作部分不适合王子们学习。“而我，”他补充说，“只是一个蹩脚的魔法师，只能做些最简单的实验。”就航海术而言（博士称“这是一门崇高而英勇的技艺”），他什么也没有学到，因为国王米亚兹不待见船只和海洋。

通过运用自己的眼睛和耳朵，他明白了许多事情。他还是小孩子时常常奇怪为什么自己不喜欢婶婶普鲁纳丽思米亚王后，如今他明白那是因为她不喜欢他。他也开始了解现在的纳尼亚是一个不幸的国家。税负沉重，法律严酷，而米亚兹是一个残酷的人。

过了一些年，有段时间王后似乎是生了病，为了她，城堡里很是忙乱，医生们来来往往，侍臣们窃窃私语。那是初夏时节。一天晚上，当人们都在忙乱时，凯斯宾才睡了几个钟头就意外地被科涅利尔斯博士弄醒。

“我们要上些天文学课吗，博士？”凯斯宾问。

“嘘！”博士说，“相信我，照我说的做。穿上衣服，你要经历一场漫长的旅行。”

凯斯宾感到很奇怪，但他已学会信任自己的老师，他马上照他说的办。他穿好衣服后，博士说：“我给你准备了袋子。我们去隔壁房间，取些殿下晚餐桌上的食物，把袋子装满。”

“那里有我的侍从。”凯斯宾说。

“他们睡得正熟，不会醒的，”博士说，“我是一个微不足道的魔法师，但还是能施法让人入睡的。”

他们进入前厅，果然，那里的两名侍从正瘫在椅子上，鼾声正响。科涅利尔斯博士快速地把剩下的冷鸡肉和几片鹿肉切下来，把肉连同面包、一两个苹果，还有一瓶上等葡萄酒装进袋子里，然后把袋子交给凯斯宾。袋子的肩带挎在凯斯宾的肩膀上，那个袋子就像是上学装书用的挎包。

“带上剑了吗？”博士问。

“带了。”凯斯宾回答。

“把这个斗篷披上，挡住剑和袋子。就是这样。现在我们上大塔楼谈谈。”

等他们到达塔楼楼顶时（那个晚上阴云密布，完全不像他们观看塔瓦星和阿兰比尔星交会的那天晚上），科涅利尔斯博士说：

“亲爱的王子，你必须马上离开这座城堡，到外面的广阔世界去谋出路。在这里你有生命危险。”

“为什么？”凯斯宾问道。

“因为你才是真正的纳尼亚之王，凯斯宾十世，凯斯宾九世的亲儿子和真正的继承人。愿国王万岁——”突然地，让凯斯宾很震惊，这个小个子单膝跪地，亲吻他的手。

“这到底是什么意思？我糊涂了。”凯斯宾问。

“我奇怪你从来没有问过我，”博士说，“为什么，身为凯斯宾国王的儿子，而你自己却不是凯斯宾国王。除了陛下你，人人都知道米亚兹是个篡位者。在他统治初期，他都没有自称国王：他称自己是护国公。之后你的母后去世，她是善良的王后，是唯一善待过我的台尔马人。随后，一个接一个的，那些熟悉你父亲的大臣不是死去就是失踪。并非死于意外事故，米亚兹除去了他们。贝利萨和乌维拉斯在一次狩猎聚会中中箭而亡：被伪装成偶然事故。所有帕萨里德名门望族的人都被他派往北方边境与巨人作战，直到他们接连战死。他以莫须有的叛国罪处死了阿里安、埃里蒙，以及其他十几个人。比福斯丹家的两兄弟被当作疯子关了起来。最后，还有七位高贵的大臣，他们是所有台尔马人中唯一不畏惧大海的，他说服他们出海寻找东海外的新大陆，而正如他所算计，他们一去不复返。当能为你说话的人一个不剩时，他的奉承者们乞求他当王（如他所授意）。自然，他顺理成章地当上了国王。”

“你的意思是他现在也要杀掉我？”凯斯宾说。

“那是八九不离十的。”科涅利尔斯博士说。

“可为什么是现在？”凯斯宾说，“我是说，要是他想的话，为什么不早先动手呢？我能妨害他什么呢？”

“他改变了对你的想法，因为刚刚两小时前有了变故。王后刚生了一个儿子。”

“我不明白这跟此事有何关联。”凯斯宾说。

“居然还不明白！”博士大声道，“我给你上的历史课和政治课都没让你长进吗？听着，只要他没有自己的亲生孩子，他还是愿意你在他死后成为国王。他可能不那么喜欢你，但他宁可让你登上王位而不是一个陌生人。现在他有了自己的孩子，他就只愿自己的孩子继承王位。你碍事了。他要除掉你这个障碍。”

“他真有这么坏吗？”凯斯宾说，“他真会谋杀我吗？”

“他杀了你的父亲。”科涅利尔斯博士说。

凯斯宾觉得很奇怪，没说话。

“我会告诉你整件事，”博士说，“但不是现在。没时间了。你必须马上走。”

“你会跟我一起走吗？”凯斯宾说。

“我不敢，”博士说，“那会给你带来更多危险。两个人比一个人更容易被追踪。亲爱的王子，亲爱的凯斯宾国王，你一定要勇敢。你必须一个人走，马上。设法越过南部边境去阿钦兰国找奈恩国王。他会善待你的。”

“我是不是再也见不到你了？”凯斯宾声音颤抖地说。

“我希望还能见面，亲爱的国王，”博士说，“除了陛下，这世上我还有什么朋友呢？我有些小法术。但眼下，速度就是一切。在你走前，给你两件礼物。这是一小袋金子——唉，这城堡的所有财宝按理都属于你。再给你件更有用的东西。”

他把东西放到凯斯宾手里，虽然他看不清是什么，但凭触感，他知道那是一个号角。

“这东西，”科涅利尔斯说，“是纳尼亚最伟大最神圣的宝物。在我还年轻时，经历了很多恐怖，用了很多咒语，才找到这东西。这是苏珊女王的神奇号角，在黄金时代末，她从纳尼亚消失时留下的。据说任何人吹响它，都会出现古怪的援助，但没人说得上到底有多古怪。它也许有魔力从古代召回露西女王、埃德蒙国王、苏珊女王，以及至尊王彼得，他们会整顿乾坤。它有可能唤起阿斯兰。拿着，凯斯宾王子：只有在最危急的时刻才能用它。现在，赶快，赶快，赶快。塔楼楼底的小门，即通往花园的小门，没上锁。好了，我们必须分手了。”

“我可以带走我的马德斯契尔吗？”凯斯宾说。

“它已经被套上马鞍，正在果园边上等着你。”

在他们走下那蜿蜒盘旋的楼梯时，科涅利尔斯低声给他说了路径和建议。凯斯宾心情沉重，但他努力把那些话都记在心里。嗅着花园的清新气息，他跟博士热诚地握了握手，跑过草坪，德斯契尔正发出欢迎的嘶鸣。就这样凯斯宾十世离开了父辈们的城堡。回望时，他见到腾空的焰火，那是在庆祝新王子的诞生。

他往南方疾驰了一整夜，只要是在熟悉的地方，他便选择走偏僻小道和林中的马道；之后他只走大路。跟它的主人一样，德斯契尔因这次不同寻常的旅行而激动，而凯斯宾虽然在跟科涅利尔斯博士告别时眼泪汪汪，如今却勇敢起来，一想到自己是凯斯宾国王，正骑马历险，左腿上佩着剑，右腿上系着苏珊女王的神奇号角，他又有些高兴起来。天亮的时候，下了点儿毛毛雨，他四周打量，见到周围都是陌生的森林、荒野和青山，想到这个世界是如此宽广和陌生，他不觉害怕起来，觉得自己很渺小。

等到天大亮时，他离开大路，在林中找了一处开阔的草地休息。他解下德斯契尔的马笼头，让它吃点儿草，而自己吃了一些鸡肉，喝了一点儿葡萄酒后，很快就睡着了。他醒来时已经是傍晚了。他吃了一点儿食物后重新上路，还是往南，走的多是人迹罕至的小径。他眼下来到丘陵地带，起起伏伏的，但上坡要多于下坡。每登上山脊，他都能见到眼前的群山变得更高大，更阴暗。夜晚临近时，他正在低坡骑行。起风了，很快就下起了倾盆大雨。德斯契尔焦躁起来，天空雷声阵阵。这时他们进入一片黑暗、似乎走不到头的松树林，曾听过的那些树木对人不友好的故事纷纷涌入凯斯宾的脑海。他记起来，怎么说自己都是一个台尔马人，他的族群随意砍伐树木，跟所有异类作战；尽管他跟其他台尔马人不一样，可也无法指望树木了解这些。

它们的确不知道。风变成暴风雨，周遭的树林都在轰鸣，吱嘎声不断。忽然传来一声巨响，一棵树刚好横倒在他身后的路上。“稳住，德斯契尔，稳住！”凯斯宾轻拍着马脖子；他自己也怕得发抖，知道自己刚才侥幸没有丧命。电光闪过，头顶一声炸雷似乎要把天空劈成两半。德斯契尔慌得狠命逃窜。凯斯宾是个好骑手，可他没力气把它拽住。他虽稳坐马鞍，但明白在这样的疯狂中自己命悬一线。黑暗中，树木一棵棵迎面而来，每次都擦身而过没有撞上。紧接着，事故发生得太突然（但也的确伤到了他），什么东西打在凯斯宾的额头上，他失去了知觉。




当他醒来时，他正躺在一个有篝火的地方，四肢伤痕累累，头痛得厉害。身旁传来低低的说话声。

“那么，”一个声音道，“在这家伙醒来前，我们必须商定如何处置他。”

“杀了他，”另一个道，“我们不能让他活下来。他会出卖我们的。”

“我们要么当初就杀了他，要么就该让他自生自灭，”第三个声音道，“我们现在不能杀他。在我们把他收留下来，给他包扎后，我们不能那么干。那是谋杀客人。”

“先生们，”凯斯宾虚弱地开口，“不管你们如何处置我，我希望你们能善待我那可怜的马。”

“在我们发现你之前，你的马早就跑掉了。”第一个声音说，凯斯宾注意到那个声音有些古怪，听起来沙哑而朴实。

“别让他的甜言蜜语把你给骗了，”第二个声音说，“我还坚持……”

“废话！”(1)第三个声音叫道，“我们当然不能谋害他。那是可耻的，尼克布里克。你怎么看，特鲁弗亨特？我们要怎么办？”

“我先让他喝点儿水。”第一个声音说，推测是特鲁弗亨特的声音。一个黑色的身形来到床边。凯斯宾觉得有一只手臂轻轻地伸到他的肩膀下——要是那真是一只手臂的话。那个身形好像有点儿不对劲。那张俯向他的脸也有些不对劲。他感觉那张脸毛茸茸的，鼻子很长，两边脸颊上还有奇怪的白斑。“也许是口罩吧，”凯斯宾心想，“又或者我发烧了，出现了幻觉。”一杯又热又甜的东西放到了他唇边，他喝了起来。这时，他们中的某个捅了捅火。火苗腾了起来，凯斯宾几乎吓得尖叫起来，因为那突如其来的火光照亮了正盯着他的那张脸。那不是人脸，而是一只獾的脸，不过比他以前见到的獾脸更大，更友善，更聪明。而且他刚才确实在说话。他也见到自己正身处洞中，躺在石南铺成的床上。火边坐着两个长有胡须的小个子，比科涅利尔斯博士更野性、更矮小，毛发更浓密，他马上意识到他们是真正的矮人，古老的矮人，他们的血管里没有任何人类血统。凯斯宾知道他终于找到了老纳尼亚人。接着他又感到头晕目眩起来。

在接下来的几天里，他慢慢知道了他们的名字。那只獾叫特鲁弗亨特；他们三个里面，他年龄最大，最和善。那个想要杀掉凯斯宾的矮人是一个坏脾气的黑矮人（也就是说，他的须发是黑色的，像马毛一样粗硬），他叫尼克布里克。另一个矮人是一个红矮人，毛发很像红色狐狸毛，他名叫特鲁普金。

“好了，”尼克布里克说，那是凯斯宾能坐起来说话的第一个晚上，“我们还得商量如何处置这个人类。不让我杀了他，你们两个还以为给了他多大恩惠呢。我想此事的最后结果就是我们不得不把他终身囚禁。我肯定不会让他活着离开我们，回到他的同类那里，出卖我们。”

“无稽之谈！(2)尼克布里克，”特鲁普金说，“为什么非得说话这么无礼？头撞在我们洞外的树上，不是这家伙的错。我觉得他看起来不像叛徒。”

“喂，”凯斯宾说，“你们还不清楚我是否想要回去。我不想。我想跟你们在一起——要是你们允许的话。我一直在寻找像你们这样的人。”

“说得真像那么回事，”尼克布里克吼道，“你是台尔马人，一个人类，难道不是吗？你当然想要回到你的同类中去。”

“不过，即便我想，也回不去了，”凯斯宾说，“出事的时候我正仓皇逃命呢。国王想杀死我。要是你们杀了我，你们正好做了让他高兴的事。”

“是吗？”特鲁弗亨特说，“怎么不早说！”

“嗯？”特鲁普金说，“怎么回事？人类，你干了什么，小小年纪就惹上了米亚兹？”

“他是我的叔叔。”凯斯宾刚开口，尼克布里克就手握匕首跳了起来。

“我说对了吧！”他嚷起来，“非但是个台尔马人，还是我们头号仇人的至亲和继承人。让这东西活命，你们还没疯够吗？”要不是獾和特鲁普金阻止，硬把他按回凳子上，他当场就会捅死凯斯宾。

“好了，最后一次警告你，尼克布里克，”特鲁普金说，“你能不能克制一点儿，还是一定要我跟特鲁弗亨特坐在你头上教训你？”

尼克布里克气呼呼地答应不乱来，其他两个叫凯斯宾把他的故事都讲出来。凯斯宾讲完后，有一阵子大家都不说话。

“这是我所听过的最离奇的事。”特鲁普金说。

“这可不好，”尼克布里克说，“真想不到人类中还流传着关于我们的故事。关于我们，他们知道得越少越好。那老保姆，算了。她真该闭上嘴。那宫廷教师把事情弄糟了：一个矮人叛徒。我恨他们。我恨他们胜过人类。你们记住我的话——准没好事。”

“你不懂的事情就别唠叨了，尼克布里克，”特鲁弗亨特说，“你们矮人跟人类一样健忘善变。我是一只野兽，千真万确，还是一只獾。我们不会变。我们一直坚持着。我认为，这会是一件大好事。我们眼前是纳尼亚真正的国王：一位真正的君主，回归真正的纳尼亚。哪怕你们矮人都忘了，我们野兽也记得，除了亚当之子为王的时期，纳尼亚糟透了。”

“天啊！(3)特鲁弗亨特，”特鲁普金说，“你不会是说你想把这个王国交给人类吧？”

“我没这么说，”獾回答，“这不是单纯的人类国度（谁能比我更清楚这个？），但却是一个由人类统治的国度。我们獾记性好，没忘了这点。怎么，愿上天保佑我们吧，难道以前的至尊王彼得不是人类？”

“你相信那些老故事？”特鲁普金问道。

“我跟你说，我们野兽，不会三心二意，”特鲁弗亨特说，“我们不会遗忘。我坚信至尊王彼得和其他王，他们统治过凯尔帕拉维尔，就像我坚信阿斯兰一样。”

“像坚信阿斯兰一样，可能吧，”特鲁普金说，“可今天谁还相信阿斯兰呢？”

“我信，”凯斯宾说，“要是我以前不信阿斯兰，我现在信了。嘲笑阿斯兰的人类，也嘲笑能言兽和矮人的传说。有时我也想知道是否真有阿斯兰：另一方面，有时我怀疑像你们这样的人是否真的存在。而你们就在我眼前。”

“没错，”特鲁弗亨特说，“你说得对，凯斯宾国王。只要你忠诚于老纳尼亚，你就是我的国王，不管别人怎么说。陛下万岁。”

“你让我恶心，獾，”尼克布里克吼道，“就算至尊王彼得和其他王是人类，可他们是另一种不同的人类。这是邪恶的台尔马人中的一员。他曾经为了好玩而捕猎动物。说，你没干过吗？”他突然谴责起凯斯宾。

“好吧，跟你们说实话，我干过，”凯斯宾说，“可那些不是能言兽。”

“都一样。”尼克布里克道。

“不一样，不一样，”特鲁弗亨特说，“你知道这不是一码事。你很清楚如今纳尼亚的野兽变了，跟你在卡洛门或台尔马见到的那些可怜的不会说话、呆笨的生物没啥两样。而且它们体型也小。它们跟我们的差别还远远大于混血矮人跟你们的差别呢。”

他们商量来商量去，最后总算达成一致，凯斯宾必须留下，甚至还许诺，等他能出门时，就带他去见见特鲁普金所说的“其他人”；很显然，在这片荒野，古纳尼亚留下的各色生灵还在躲躲藏藏地生存着。

第六章　隐匿的居民


凯斯宾最快乐的时光就这样开始了。一个晴朗的夏天早晨，青草上还缀着露水的时候，他就已经跟着獾和那两个矮人出发了，穿过森林，登上一座高高的马鞍形山峰，走下向阳的南坡，从那里可以俯览阿钦兰的绿色丘陵地。

“我们先去拜访那三只胖熊。”特鲁普金说。

他们进入一片林间空地，来到一棵爬满青苔的中空老橡树前，特鲁弗亨特用他的爪子在树干上敲了三下，没有回应。他又敲了敲，里面传来一个迷迷糊糊的声音：“走开。还没到起床时间呢。”可当他敲第三次的时候，里面传来一阵声响，像是发生了小地震，紧接着一道门开启，出来了三只棕熊，胖乎乎的，还眨巴着小眼睛。等了解了事情的来龙去脉后（费了很长时间才解释清楚，因为他们都还睡眼蒙眬着），正如特鲁弗亨特所说，他们一致认为亚当之子应该成为纳尼亚之王，还一一亲吻了凯斯宾——那些亲吻湿乎乎的，鼻子在脸上嗅来嗅去——还请他吃蜂蜜。凯斯宾不太想吃蜂蜜，因为没有面包，又是早上这种时候，可他觉得欣然接受才不失礼。之后他花了很长时间才把黏上的黏糊糊的蜂蜜弄干净。

告别后，他们继续前进，来到一片高大的山毛榉树丛，特鲁弗亨特喊道：“帕特维格！帕特维格！”眨眼间，一只红色松鼠蹦蹦跳跳地从枝条上下来，落在他们的头顶上方，凯斯宾还从未见过这么神气活现的松鼠。他要比偶尔在城堡花园里见到的那些寻常、不会说话的松鼠大得多；他几乎有一只小猎犬那么大，只要一看他的脸，你就知道他会说话。确实，要打断他的话还真不容易呢，因为跟所有的松鼠一样，他是一个话匣子。他当即欢迎凯斯宾，还问他想不想吃坚果，凯斯宾表示想吃，还致了谢。当帕特维格蹦跳着去取坚果时，特鲁弗亨特跟凯斯宾咬耳朵：“别看。看另一边。对松鼠而言，盯着人家去储藏处，或是流露出你想知道储藏地点，都是非常不礼貌的行为。”很快帕特维格带着坚果回来了，凯斯宾品尝后，帕特维格询问是否让他给其他伙伴传递消息。“因为我脚不沾地哪儿都去得了。”他说。特鲁弗亨特和矮人们都觉得这是一个好主意，于是让帕特维格把消息传给名字古怪的各色人等，通知他们在三天后的午夜到跳舞草坪来参加盛宴和大会。“你最好也通知那三只胖熊，”特鲁普金补充，“我们刚才忘了跟他们提了。”

他们下一个拜访对象是战栗林中的七兄弟。特鲁普金带领他们返回那座马鞍形山峰，然后顺着北坡下山往东走，一直走到一个周围都是山石和杉树、看起来很阴沉的地方。他们安静地走着，随即凯斯宾感觉脚下的地面在颤动，就好像正有人在地下锤锤打打。特鲁普金来到一块约水桶盖大小的平整石头前，在上面跺了跺。过了好一会儿，石头被某人或某物从下面移开，眼前出现了一个圆形暗洞，大量的热气和蒸汽从那里面冒了出来，一个跟特鲁普金很像的矮人的脑袋出现在洞口中央。两人谈了很久，那矮人的疑心比松鼠和胖熊都要重，但最后一行人都获邀进入了洞里。凯斯宾感到自己正沿着幽暗的阶梯一直往下走，进入地下，来到底部时，他见到了火光。那是来自熔炉的火光。原来这里是一个铁匠铺。一条地下河从洞旁流过。两个矮人站在风箱旁，另一个正用火钳夹着一块烧得通红的金属，将它按在铁砧板上，第四个正锤打着这块金属，另外两个矮人一边迎接他们，一边在一块油腻腻的布上擦拭着自己长满老茧的小手。他们费了不少唇舌才让这些矮人相信凯斯宾是一个朋友而不是敌人，但等他们相信之后，都大声祝愿：“国王万岁。”他们还送上尊贵的礼物——凯斯宾、特鲁普金和尼克布里克都得到了盔甲、头盔和宝剑。要是愿意，獾本来也可获得同样的礼物，可他说自己是野兽，货真价实的，假如自身的爪子和牙齿不足以保全自己，他的爪牙就不值得保有了。武器工艺之精良，凯斯宾还从未见过，他开心地收下了矮人打造的宝剑，舍弃了自己原来的剑，相形之下，原来的剑就像玩具一样不结实，像木棍一样笨拙。那七兄弟（都是红矮人）答应去跳舞草坪参加盛宴。

再往前走一段，他们来到了五个黑矮人居住的山洞。那地方坐落在一条干旱、到处是岩石的山谷。他们不放心地打量着凯斯宾，最终最年长的那个发话了：“只要他反对米亚兹，我们就拥护他为王。”年纪略小的那个说：“用不用我们上山到峭壁那里送信？那上面住着一两个食人魔，还有一个女巫，我们可以介绍你们认识。”

“完全不需要。”凯斯宾说。

“我认为确实不用，”特鲁弗亨特说，“我们不要跟那种家伙混在一起。”尼克布里克不同意这说法，但特鲁普金和獾都否决了他。凯斯宾由此吃惊地意识到，古老传说中无论是善良的还是恐怖的生物在纳尼亚都还有子孙后代。

“要是我们把那些乌合之众都召集进来，阿斯兰就不会和我们做朋友了。”从黑矮人的山洞里出来时，特鲁弗亨特说。

“噢，阿斯兰！”特鲁普金快活而又轻蔑地说，“要没有我做朋友才更严重呢。”

“你相信阿斯兰吗？”凯斯宾问尼克布里克。

“我愿意相信任何人、任何事，”尼克布里克说，“只要那些人和事能将该死的台尔马蛮子打垮，把他们赶出纳尼亚。任何人或任何事，管他是阿斯兰还是白女巫，明白吗？”

“安静，安静，”特鲁弗亨特说，“你根本不知道自己在说什么。比起米亚兹及其同类，白女巫是个更邪恶的敌人。”

“对矮人来说，她不是。”尼克布里克说。

接下来去的地方令人愉快。他们略往下走，见到山脉向外延伸铺展成一条很大的幽谷，那是树木覆盖的峡谷，谷底有一条水流湍急的河。河边的开阔地长着一大片洋地黄和野玫瑰，空气里传来蜜蜂的嗡嗡声。在这里特鲁弗亨特又大声叫起来：“格兰斯托姆！格兰斯托姆！”过了一会儿，凯斯宾听到马蹄声。蹄声越来越响，直至整条河谷都颤动起来，最后，横冲直撞地，从灌木丛中疾驰而来的是凯斯宾见过的最高贵的生物，伟大的马人格兰斯托姆和他的三个儿子。他身体两侧是发亮的栗色，覆盖了宽阔胸膛的胡须是金红色的。他是一个预言家、观星者，所以很清楚他们的来意。

“国王万岁，”他喊道，“我跟我的儿子们已做好了大战的准备。什么时候打仗？”

到目前为止，凯斯宾和其他人都没有真正想过开战。他们也许有过模糊的念头，比如偶尔袭击一下人类的农庄，或是袭击那些进犯这片南部荒野的猎人。总的来说，他们只是想在森林、洞穴里隐居，试图重建一个隐蔽的老纳尼亚。格兰斯托姆一提此话，大家都严肃对待起来。

“你是说一场真正的大战，把米亚兹从纳尼亚赶出去？”凯斯宾问道。

“还用问吗？”马人说，“否则陛下为何要身穿盔甲，佩带宝剑呢？”

“这可行吗，格兰斯托姆？”獾问。

“时机成熟了，”格兰斯托姆说，“我观测天象，獾，因为我的本领是观测，而你擅长记忆。塔瓦星和阿兰比尔星已在天庭相会，地球上亚当之子又再次掌权，为万物命名。是时候了。我们在跳舞草坪召开的会议必须是军事会议。”他说话的语气让凯斯宾等人都不再犹豫：他们觉得很有可能赢得战争，他们认定必须要发动一场大战。

因为已经过了正午，他们跟马人一起歇息吃饭，食物是马人提供的，有燕麦饼、苹果、药草、葡萄酒和奶酪。

下一站要拜访的地方非常近，但他们不得不绕远路以避开人类居住的区域。午后时分，他们来到一片温暖平坦的田野，田野的两侧有树篱。特鲁弗亨特在绿色篱笆的一个小洞口喊话，从洞里跳出一只会说话的老鼠，这是凯斯宾没料到的。他比一般的老鼠个头大，后腿直立时有一英尺来高，耳朵几乎跟兔子的一般长（但更宽些）。他叫里皮契普，是只快活好战的老鼠。他身佩一把袖珍长剑，捻弄着长须，好像那是胡子一样。“我们一共是十二个，陛下，”他说，潇洒优雅地鞠了一躬，“我们听凭陛下调遣。”凯斯宾使劲憋住笑（可没忍住），他不由想到，把里皮契普和他所有伙伴放入一只洗衣篮就可以很轻易地背回家。

凯斯宾那天走访了很多伙伴，要一一介绍得花上很长时间，其中包括鼹鼠泥铲子，三个铁齿钢牙的家伙（跟特鲁弗亨特一样都是獾），野兔卡米洛，还有刺猬霍格尔斯托克。最后他们在草地边的一口井旁歇息，那块圆形草坪宽大平坦，周边是高大的榆树，长长的树影倒映在草坪上，此时夕阳西沉，雏菊收拢了花瓣，白嘴鸦正飞回巢穴。他们在这里吃了随身带的食物，特鲁普金点起了烟斗（尼克布里克不吸烟）。

“唉，”獾说，“要是能把这些树木和这口井的精灵唤醒就好了，那样今天就圆满了。”

“不能吗？”凯斯宾说。

“办不到，”特鲁弗亨特说，“我们没有这个能力。自从人类到来，砍伐了森林，污染了河流，树精和水仙子就陷入沉睡。谁知道他们是否还会醒来。对我们这方来说，这可是个大损失。台尔马人极害怕森林，一旦树木愤怒地移动起来，就能把我们的敌人给吓疯，拼命逃离纳尼亚。”

“你们动物的想象力真丰富！”特鲁普金说，他从不相信这类话，“怎么想象力就只停留在树和水上？要是石头都能自动砸向米亚兹，那岂不是更好吗？”

獾听后只是嘟囔了一声，接着大家都沉默起来。就在凯斯宾快要睡着时，他听到身后树林深处隐约传来音乐声。他觉得那不过是个梦，又翻身睡去；但耳朵一接触到地面，他立时感觉到或是听到（一时难以分辨）轻微的敲击声或鼓声。他抬起头来。敲击声又立刻减弱，音乐声再次传来，这回更清晰了。听起来像是笛声。他见特鲁弗亨特坐了起来，注视着树林。月光很亮，凯斯宾睡着的时间比他所以为的长。音乐声越来越近，曲调狂野而梦幻，还能听到许多只脚轻轻走动的声音，直到最后，月光下，从树林里出来的那些跳舞的身影是凯斯宾这一辈子都渴望见到的。比起小矮人，他们高不了多少，可更轻盈，更优雅。他们头发拳曲，头上长有小角，上半身裸露在微光下，微微发亮，腿脚是山羊的腿脚。

“羊人！”凯斯宾叫着跳起身来，很快那些羊人就把他围住了。跟他们解释事情经过没花多少工夫，他们当即接受了凯斯宾。凯斯宾还没反应过来是怎么回事，就发现自己已加入了他们的舞蹈。特鲁普金，动作比起他人更笨拙、急促，也跟着跳了起来，甚至特鲁弗亨特也尽可能地扭动起身体。只有尼克布里克待在原地，一声不吭地看着。伴随着尖细的管乐，羊人围着凯斯宾跳舞。他们面孔古怪，神色既快乐又忧伤，注视着他；一共来了几十个羊人，有孟提尔斯、奥本提纳斯、杜玛斯、沃伦斯、沃提纳斯、格比尔斯、尼米纳斯、诺瑟斯、奥斯卡斯等等。帕特维格给他们一一送了口信。

凯斯宾第二天醒来时，他简直不敢相信自己不是在做梦；但草地上到处都还留着小小的分趾蹄印。





第七章　危难中的老纳尼亚


他们昨晚遇到羊人的地方就是那片跳舞草坪，凯斯宾和他的朋友们一直待在那里，等待开会那晚的到来。在星空下露宿，仅靠井水解渴，主要以坚果和野果为食，这对凯斯宾来说是一种从未有过的经历，他以前住的是绣帷装饰的城堡房间，睡的是铺着丝绸床单的床，吃的是摆在前厅、盛在金银食器里的美食，有侍从随时待命。可他从未像现在这般开心。如今的睡眠让他有一种从未有过的精神焕发，食物也更美味，他变得坚强起来，脸上带有更多的王者之气。

那重要的夜晚来临时，他的各色古怪朋友或独来独往，或三三两两或成群结伙地溜进了草坪，月色皎洁，时近满月。见到来了那么多人，听到他们的招呼，他的心激动起来。他见过的都到场了——胖熊、红矮人、黑矮人、鼹鼠、獾、野兔、刺猬，还有他没见过的——五个红得跟红毛狐狸一样的羊怪，那一窝会说话的老鼠，全副武装，踏着刺耳的喇叭的拍子行进。还有几只猫头鹰，来自乌鸦断崖的老乌鸦，最后进场的（让凯斯宾叹为观止）是跟在马人身后如假包换的巨人，他是住在死人山的威伯维德，背上背着一筐晕头转向的矮人，巨人请他们搭顺风车，他们接受了邀请，可现在宁愿自己走着来。

三只胖熊急迫地要求先吃饭后开会，要么饭后开要么明天再开。里皮契普和他的鼠军则提议开会和吃饭可以缓一缓，建议当晚突袭城堡，攻打米亚兹。帕特维格及其松鼠伙伴们则建议吃饭开会两不误，干吗不同时进行？鼹鼠们主张首要任务是在草坪周围挖壕沟。羊人认为跳场庄严的舞蹈作为开场会更好。老乌鸦虽然同意胖熊的意见，认为饭前开会花费的时间太长，可又恳求大家让他先给大家做个小小的致辞。凯斯宾、马人，以及矮人们都否决了这些建议，坚持要马上开战争动员会。

他们好不容易说服大家安静，围成一大圈坐下，并费了很大的劲制止帕特维跑来跑去地嚷嚷。“安静！安静！大家听国王演讲。”凯斯宾站起身来，略有点儿紧张。“纳尼亚人！”他刚开口，还没来得及继续，这时野兔卡米洛开口道：“嘘！附近有人。”

他们都是野生的生物，习惯了被追捕，因此都像雕像一样一动不动。野兽们转身嗅着卡米洛所指的方向。

“闻起来像是人的气味，但又不太像。”特鲁弗亨特低语。

“他越来越近了。”卡米洛说。

“两只獾，还有你们三个矮人，把你们的弓箭准备好，轻轻地上前打探。”凯斯宾下令。

“我们干掉他。”一个黑矮人冷酷地说，箭搭上了弓弦。

“如果是单独一个，别射箭，”凯斯宾指示，“抓活的。”

“为什么？”矮人问。

“照命令做。”马人格兰斯托姆说。

大家静静地等着，那三个矮人和那两只獾蹑手蹑脚地走过草坪，来到西北方的树丛中。接着传来一声矮人的尖叫。“不许动！谁在那儿？”然后是猛地一跃。过了一会儿，传来一个凯斯宾很熟悉的声音：“好了，好了，我没带武器。尊敬的獾们，要是愿意的话，抓着我的手腕，但可别咬穿了我的手。我有话要跟国王说。”

“科涅利尔斯博士！”凯斯宾高兴地叫道，冲上前去迎接他的老导师。其余人都围了上来。

“呸！”尼克布里克说，“一个变节的矮人。一个杂种！要不要用剑刺穿他的喉咙？”

“少安毋躁，尼克布里克，”特鲁普金说，“这家伙没法选择自己的出身。”

“他是我最亲密的朋友和救命恩人，”凯斯宾说，“不愿与他相处的人可以离开我的队伍：马上走。最亲爱的博士，很高兴能再次见面。你是如何找到我们的？”

“用了一点儿简单的魔法，陛下。”博士说，因为刚才行走匆忙，现在还气喘吁吁的，“现在没时间细谈了。我们必须马上离开这里。你的行踪被出卖了，米亚兹正在采取行动。明天中午前你们就会被包围。”

“出卖！”凯斯宾说道，“谁干的？”

“准是另一个变节的矮人，毫无疑问。”尼克布里克说。

“你的马，德斯契尔泄的密，”科涅利尔斯博士说，“那可怜的畜生没脑子。你晕倒后，很自然地，它逛回了城堡的马厩。就这样，你逃走的秘密被人知晓了。我赶紧溜走，可不想被关在米亚兹的刑讯室里受审问。至于上哪儿去找你，我从我的水晶球里能大致猜到。那一整天——那是前天了——我在森林里见到米亚兹的搜索部队。昨天我听说他派出了军队。我觉得你们有些矮人，嗯，所谓的纯种矮人，没有多少森林生存技巧，没有预料中的那么好。你们到处留下踪迹。太大意了。不管怎么说，某些东西警示了米亚兹，老纳尼亚没有像他所希望的那样消失，他追来了。”

“好哇！”博士脚下某处传来一个尖细的嗓音，“他们尽管来！我坚决要求国王把我和我的伙伴们派往前线。”

“到底是什么？”科涅利尔斯博士说，“难道陛下把蚱蜢或是蚊子也收进了部队？”他弯下腰去，透过眼镜仔细查看，忽然笑了起来。

“以狮子的名义起誓，”他说道，“原来是只老鼠。老鼠先生，幸会。能见到如此勇敢的野兽，我感到很荣幸。”

“我们将成为朋友，博学的人，”里皮契普尖声说，“要是队伍里有任何矮人或是巨人对你言语不敬，我会用剑对付他们。”

“还有时间说这些蠢话吗？”尼克布里克发问，“我们的计划是什么？是战，是逃？”

“战吧，如果情势需要，”特鲁普金说，“可我们几乎还没做好应战准备，而且这里根本不适合防守。”

“我不愿意逃跑。”凯斯宾说。

“听他的！听他的！”胖熊说，“不管要做什么，我们都不要跑。特别是不要在晚饭前跑，饭后也不要急着跑。”

“那些最能跑的不见得总要拖到最后才逃跑，”马人说，“再说，我们为什么要让敌人为我们选择阵地，而自己却不主动选择呢？让我们找一个更有利的地形。”

“明智的提议，陛下，这提议明智。”特鲁弗亨特说。

“可我们要转移到哪儿去呢？”几个声音问道。

“陛下，”科涅利尔斯博士说，“还有你们这些各色各样的家伙，我觉得我们必须赶紧往东走，沿着河流去大森林。台尔马人讨厌那个区域。他们一直害怕大海，害怕从海上来的某种东西。这就是为什么他们任由丛林蔓延。要是传言不假，那座古老的凯尔帕拉维尔城堡就坐落在河口。那一带对我们友善，又憎恨我们的敌人。我们必须去阿斯兰堡垒。”

“阿斯兰堡垒？”几个声音同时说道，“我们对此一无所知。”

“它坐落在大森林边上，那是一个巨大的土丘，纳尼亚人在古代于一个神奇的地方建造了它，那里有一块非常神奇的石头，也许如今还在。土丘是中空的，里面有很多走廊和洞穴，那块石头就在正中的一个洞穴里。土丘有足够的空间存放我们的储备，我们当中那些最需要隐藏的，还有那些习惯地下生存的，都可以住在洞穴里。其余的待在树林里。必要时，我们所有人（除了这位可敬的巨人）可以全部撤入土丘，在那里我们可以避过除饥荒外的诸多危险。”

“我们当中有一个博学的人真是好事。”特鲁弗亨特说；但特鲁普金低声嘟囔：“无稽之谈！(1)我希望我们的头领不要对这些鬼话感兴趣，还是多考虑食物和武器的问题。”但大家都同意科涅利尔斯的提议。那天晚上，半个小时后，他们开始行军。天没亮他们就抵达了阿斯兰堡垒。

果然是一个很棒的地方，一座绿色的圆形山丘坐落在另一座山丘之上，那里早已被树林覆盖，有一个低矮的小出入口通向里面。对于不熟悉其中的人，里面的通道像迷宫一样错综复杂，墙上和天花板垒着光滑的石头，借着晨光，凯斯宾在石头上发现了奇怪的人物和弯弯曲曲的图案，以及很多狮形图画。这一切似乎属于更古老的纳尼亚，比他的保姆给他讲述的那个纳尼亚还要久远。

等他们在堡垒里面或周边安顿好，命运开始与他们作对了。米亚兹国王的侦察兵很快就发现了他们的新巢穴。国王与他的大军来到了森林边缘。敌人比预想的还要强大，这种情形并不少见。当看到敌军一个连队接着一个连队地拥来，凯斯宾的心沉重起来。虽然米亚兹的士兵害怕进入树林，可他们更害怕米亚兹，在他的指挥下，他们深入树林作战，有时几乎挨近了堡垒。凯斯宾和其他队长也多次出击，一直打到开阔地。他们多在白天打仗，有时夜里也打；总的来说，凯斯宾这一方损失更惨重。

最后，到了那天夜里，形势糟得不能再糟了，下了一整天的暴雨，到了傍晚总算停了，但冷得刺骨。那天早晨凯斯宾部署了他们迄今为止最大的战役，大家都对此寄予希望。他率领大多数的矮人要在黎明时分攻击国王的右翼，在他们激烈作战时，巨人威伯维德、马人和一些最凶猛的野兽要从另一处杀出来，奋力切断国王的右翼与大部队的联系。但计划失败了。没人提醒凯斯宾（在现如今的纳尼亚没人记得这回事），巨人的脑子不灵活。可怜的威伯维德，尽管跟狮子一样勇敢，却有一个不折不扣的巨人脑袋。他在错误的时间错误的地点出击，导致他和凯斯宾的队伍损失惨重，可敌人却没什么损失。最勇猛的一头熊受了伤，有个马人也受伤严重，凯斯宾的队伍里只有少数几个没有流血负伤。一帮沮丧的人挤在滴雨的树下，吃着那少得可怜的晚餐。

最伤心的要数巨人威伯维德了。他知道这都是他的错。他默默地坐着，流下大滴大滴的眼泪，泪水凝聚在他的鼻端，落下时溅在那窝露营刚开始觉得暖和，正昏昏入睡的老鼠身上。这下他们都跳了起来，抖落耳朵里的水，拧着小毯子，用尖细有力的嗓音质问巨人，他是否还嫌他们不够湿，非得再添点儿水。接着，其他人也被吵醒，跟老鼠们说招他们来是当侦察员，不是来开演唱会的，质问他们干吗吵吵嚷嚷。威伯维德只好踮着脚离开，想找个能让他静静地伤心的角落，却踩到了某个家伙的尾巴（后来说是一只狐狸），那个家伙咬了他一口。这下人人都开始大发脾气了。

在堡垒正中那个秘密而神奇的房间里，凯斯宾国王正跟科涅利尔斯、獾、尼克布里克和特鲁普金开会。古代工艺造的粗柱子支撑着屋顶。洞穴的中间就是那块石头——那是一个石桌，石头当中开裂，上面原刻有某些文字。但岁月的风霜雨雪几乎侵蚀掉了那些文字，侵蚀发生在古代，那时的石桌就在山顶上，还没有在其上建起堡垒。他们没有用这张石桌，也没有坐在石桌旁：这石头太神奇，不适合当平常物件使用。他们坐在离石桌不远的木头上，面前是一张粗糙的木桌，桌上摆着一盏简陋的泥灯，灯光照亮了他们苍白的脸，把长长的影子投在墙上。

“如果陛下想用那个号角的话，”特鲁弗亨特说，“我想现在是时候了。”当然，凯斯宾几天前跟他们提过他的宝物。

“我们的确处于危难中，”凯斯宾回答，“但很难确定我们真到了最危难的时候。想想看，要是到了更危急的时刻，而我们又已经用了它了？”

“照这么说，”尼克布里克说，“陛下现在不肯用，等用的时候就太晚了。”

“我同意你的说法。”科涅利尔斯博士说。

“你怎么想，特鲁普金？”凯斯宾问道。

“唉，就我而言，”红矮人说，他刚才一直漠不关心地听着，“陛下知道的，我觉得那个号角——那边那块断裂的石头——你们伟大的彼得王——还有你们说的狮子阿斯兰——都是空想。陛下吹不吹响号角，对我都没分别。有一点我很坚持，就是不要让军队听到这些话。勾起他们对神奇援助的希望，而希望又肯定会落空，这绝不是什么好事。”

“好吧，以阿斯兰之名，我们将会吹响苏珊女王的号角。”凯斯宾说。

“还有一件事，陛下，”科涅利尔斯博士说，“也许应该先办好。我们不知道这个援助将以何种形式到来。可能会召唤阿斯兰亲自从海上来。可我觉得它更可能会召唤至尊王彼得以及他强大的伙伴们从远古来。不管哪种情形，我想我们无法确定那援助会降临到眼下这块地方——”

“你总算说了句大实话。”特鲁普金插嘴。

“我认为，”那个博学的人继续道，“他们或他会回到纳尼亚某个古老的地方。这里，我们所坐之处，是所有地方中最古老、最神奇的地方，所以，我认为，这里是最有可能得到回应的地方。但还有其他两处地方。一处是蓝登荒原，在河流上游，河狸坝以西，据记载，那里是当初那些高贵的孩子头一次在纳尼亚露面的地方。另一处在河口下游，他们的城堡凯尔帕拉维尔原来就坐落在那里。假如阿斯兰亲自来临，那里也是迎接他的最好地点，因为所有的传说都说他是伟大的海王之子，他会从海上来。我想派两个信使去这两个地点，即蓝登荒原和河口，去迎接他们——或他——或它。”

“我刚才就想，”特鲁普金小声咕哝着，“这些蠢事的第一个效果不是给我们带来援手，而是让我们两个士兵丧命。”

“你想派谁去，科涅利尔斯博士？”凯斯宾问。

“松鼠是最好人选，他们能够穿越敌方地盘，又不会被逮住。”特鲁弗亨特建议。

“我们的松鼠（我们并没有多少只），”尼克布里克说，“都是很不负责任的。我唯一信任、能胜任这个工作的就是帕特维格。”

“好吧，那就派遣帕特维格，”凯斯宾国王说，“谁当另一个信使？我知道你想去，特鲁弗亨特，可你速度不快。你也不行，科涅利尔斯博士。”

“我不愿意离开，”尼克布里克说，“这里周围都是人类和野兽，必须有个矮人在场以确保矮人们得到公正的对待。”

“胡言乱语！(2)”特鲁普金愤怒地嚷道，“你就这么和国王说话吗？派我去，陛下，我愿意去。”

“可我以为你不相信号角的魔力，特鲁普金。”凯斯宾说。

“现在也不信，陛下。可这有什么关系呢？死于徒劳的寻找和死在这里，有什么分别呢。你是我的国王。提建议和听从命令是两码事。我已经给出了我的建议，而现在是时候服从命令了。”

“我永远不会忘记这点的，特鲁普金，”凯斯宾说，“你们中的哪个去把帕特维格找来。我将在什么时候吹响号角？”

“我认为等到太阳升起的时刻，陛下，”科涅利尔斯博士说，“那样有时能让善意的法术更灵验。”

几分钟后，帕特维格来了，向他交代了任务。事实上，跟很多松鼠一样，他斗志昂扬，精神抖擞，充满激情，也很淘气（更不用说自大了），他听令后就急切地要出发。他被派往蓝登荒原，而特鲁普金则赶去近一些的河口。匆忙吃了饭后，两人带上国王、獾和科涅利尔斯的热烈感谢和祝福出发了。

第八章　他们如何离开海岛


“因此，”特鲁普金说（正如你刚意识到的，刚才就是特鲁普金在给那四个孩子讲故事，此时他们正坐在凯尔帕拉维尔已荒废的大厅的草地上），“因此我在口袋里塞了一两块面包皮，武器都留下了，只拿了把匕首，在天蒙蒙亮的时候，进了树林。我埋头走了好几个钟头，突然听到一声响，那是我有生以来第一次听到。嗯，我永远都忘不了那响声。空气里回荡着这声音，像雷声一样响亮，但比雷声持久多了，清凉甜美就像是音乐拂过水面，但又强烈得整片树林都震颤起来。我跟自己说：‘如果那不是号角声，就叫我兔子好了。’又过了一会儿，我寻思为什么他不早点儿吹响号角呢——”

“那是什么时候？”埃德蒙问。

“在九点和十点之间。”特鲁普金说。

“正好是我们在火车站的时候！”孩子们都异口同声地说，互相看了看，眼睛闪亮着。

“请继续讲。”露西对矮人说。

“嗯，就像我刚才讲的，我寻思着，但同时奋力飞奔。我一整晚都没停歇，然后，今天清晨半明半亮时，我犯了错，蠢得跟巨人一样，因为不想沿河绕一大圈，我横穿一片开阔地，冒险走了捷径，结果被逮住了。逮住我的不是军队，而是一个自负的老傻瓜，那家伙掌管着一座小城堡，那是米亚兹通往海岸方向的最后一个据点。我没向他们招供，这是不用说的，可我是一个矮人，这就足以构成罪名了。但是，谢天谢地！(1)幸亏那管事的是个自负的傻瓜。换作其他人肯定会当场把我处死。可他要是不给我一个壮丽的死法，就无法心满意足：他要以最隆重的形式把我交给鬼魂。然后，这位年轻的女士（他朝苏珊点了点头）小小地显示了下箭术——老实说，射得不错——结果就是现在这样了。当然，我的盔甲没了，他们夺了去了。”他把烟灰敲掉，又续上烟草。

“天啊！”彼得说，“是那号角……你的号角，苏……昨天把我们从车站月台的椅子上给拽到这里来！我简直不敢相信，但全对上了。”

“我不明白你为什么不肯信，”露西说，“假如你的确是相信魔法的。不是有很多故事讲述魔法强行把人带离某个地方——某个世界——进入另一个地方或另一个世界？我是说，就像《一千零一夜》里的魔法师一召唤某个神灵，它就得出现。与此同理，我们不得不来。”

“好吧，”彼得说，“我觉得怪异的是，在故事中，召唤总是来自我们世界的某人。没人真的想过那神灵来自何方。”

“现如今我们知道被招来的神灵是何感受了，”埃德蒙轻笑一声，“天啊！想到我们就这样被人招之即来，有点儿让人不舒服。这要比父亲说的活在电话的摆布之下还糟糕。”

“可我们愿意到这里，不是吗，”露西说，“也许阿斯兰需要我们？”

“眼下，”矮人说，“我们要怎么办呢？我想我最好回到凯斯宾国王那里，跟他说没有任何援助到来。”

“没援助？”苏珊说，“可号角灵验了。瞧，我们来了。”

“嗯……嗯……好吧，无可否认。我明白，”矮人说，他的烟斗好像给堵了（不管怎样，他做出忙于清理的样子），“可是……嗯……我是说……”

“可你还没弄清楚我们是谁吧？”露西嚷道，“你真笨。”

“我猜你们是古老传说中的那四个孩子，”特鲁普金说，“我当然很高兴见到你们。很有趣，真的。可……不会获什么罪吧？”他又迟疑起来。

“说下去，想说什么就直说。”埃德蒙说。

“好吧，那么……无意冒犯，”特鲁普金说，“可是，你们懂的，国王、特鲁弗亨特和科涅利尔斯博士正盼着……嗯，要是你们明白我的意思，援助。换句话说，我想他们一直把你们想象成伟大的勇士。照现状看……虽然我们很喜欢小孩子，可眼下，正打着仗……我确信你们理解的。”

“你的意思是，你觉得我们根本指望不上。”埃德蒙气得脸都红了。

“好啦，请别生气，”矮人打断了他的话，“我向你们保证，我亲爱的小朋友们……”

“你说我们小真是有点儿过分了，”埃德蒙跳起来，“我猜想你不相信我们打赢了贝鲁纳战役？好吧，你爱怎么说我都行，因为我知道……”

“发脾气是没用的，”彼得说，“先去藏宝室给他找套合适的新盔甲，把我们也武装起来，之后我们再谈。”

“我不明白这有什么意义……”埃德蒙刚开口，但露西悄悄跟他说：“我们是不是最好听彼得的？他是至尊王，你懂的。我想他有主意了。”于是埃德蒙同意了，借助他的手电，他们所有人，包括特鲁普金，走下阶梯，进入黑暗、冰冷、光华蒙尘的藏宝室。

见到摆放在架子上的财宝（他踮起脚尖才能看到），矮人的眼睛都亮了，他自言自语：“要是让尼克布里克见到这些，那绝无好事，绝无。”他们很轻松地就给他找来一件锁子甲、一把宝剑、一顶头盔、一面盾牌、一把弓和满满一箭筒的箭，这些都是按矮人的尺码打造的。那顶头盔是铜制的，还镶嵌有红宝石，剑柄是黄金铸的：这么多财富，特鲁普金这辈子还从未见过，更别提拿过了。孩子们也穿上了锁子甲，戴上头盔；埃德蒙拿了剑和盾牌，露西拿了一张弓——当然，彼得和苏珊已经拿上他们各自的礼物了。他们上楼梯时，身上的盔甲叮当作响，看起来、感觉上更像是纳尼亚人，而不像是学童了，那两个男孩走在后面，显然正计划着什么。露西听到埃德蒙说：“不，让我上。要是我赢了，那会让他更难堪，而要是我输了的话，也不会让我们太沮丧。”

“好吧，埃德。”彼得说。

等他们来到外面的光亮处，埃德蒙很礼貌地转身对矮人说：“我有事拜托你。像我们这样的小孩不常有机会遇到像你这样了不起的武士。你是否愿意跟我比试一下剑法？我将会非常荣幸。”

“可是，小伙子，”特鲁普金说，“这些剑很锋利的。”

“我知道，”埃德蒙说，“可我没法近你身，而你又够机智，足以让我毫发无伤地缴械。”

“这是危险的游戏，”特鲁普金说，“可既然你坚持，我就试上一两招吧。”

很快，两剑出鞘，其他三人跳下台子，站在一边观战。很值得一看。这不像你在舞台上见到的那种看起来很蠢的阔剑比试。甚至也不像你偶尔见到的那种打得相当精彩的长剑比试。这是场真刀真枪的阔剑比试。而精彩之处就是去砍对手的腿脚，因为那些地方没有铠甲保护。当对手砍来，你两脚跃起，对方的剑就落了空。这方面矮人有优势，因为身高要高得多，挥剑时埃德蒙不得不弯下腰。如果是二十四小时以前他跟特鲁普金对抗，我不认为埃德蒙会有胜算。但自从踏上这个岛，纳尼亚的气息一直作用于他，所有往昔的征战又回到了他的脑海中，他的胳膊和手指恢复了以前的技艺。他再次成为埃德蒙国王。两名斗士打了一圈又一圈，一剑又一剑地对攻，这时苏珊（她怎么也喜欢不上这种运动）大叫一声：“啊，当心。”转眼之间，快得没人（除非他们像彼得一样内行）看清是怎么回事，埃德蒙一抖腕挽了一个剑花，矮人的剑脱手飞出，特鲁普金绞拧着自己的空手，就像是给板球棒“蛰”了一下。

“没伤着吧，我希望，我亲爱的小朋友？”埃德蒙略有些气喘，收剑回鞘。

“我了解你的意图了，”特鲁普金抑制住内心的喜悦说，“在技巧上你胜我一筹。”

“确实如此，”彼得补充道，“哪怕是世界上最顶尖的剑客也有可能被一记新招给缴了械。我想在其他方面再给特鲁普金一次比试机会，那样会公平些。你愿意和我妹妹比试射箭吗？你知道的，在射箭上无花招可玩。”

“啊，你是个爱开玩笑的人，你确实是，”矮人说，“我看出来了。经过今天早上的事，好像我还不了解她擅长射箭似的。尽管如此，我愿意试一下。”他没好气地说着，可还是眼睛一亮，因为在矮人里他也是一个著名的弓箭手。

他们五个人来到外面的院子里。

“靶子是什么？”彼得问道。

“我觉得墙头挂在树枝上的苹果不错。”苏珊说。

“很不错，小姑娘，”特鲁普金说，“你是指靠近门拱中间的那个黄苹果吗？”

“不，不是那个，”苏珊说，“是上方高处的那个红苹果，在城垛上。”

小矮人的表情一下子垮了下来。“那看起来更像是一颗樱桃，哪里是苹果。”他咕哝着，可没大声说出来。

他们抛硬币决定谁先射（特鲁普金觉得很有趣，他从没见过抛硬币），苏珊没猜对。他们要站在大厅通向院子的台阶最高处射。从矮人站位和拉弓的样子就能看出他是个行家里手。

嘣的一声弦响。箭射得好极了。但还是射偏了，小苹果晃动了一下，一片树叶飘落。接下来，苏珊来到台阶顶端，把弦拉开。她没有像埃德蒙享受比赛那样享受她的这场比试，一半他那样的兴奋都没有；不是因为她对自己能否射中那个苹果有任何疑问，而是因为苏珊心肠很软，她甚至讨厌击败刚被击败的人。她把箭拉到耳边时，小矮人热切地盯着她。转瞬间，伴随着砰的一声轻响，在那个寂静的地方，他们听得很清晰，苹果落在草地，苏珊的箭扎在上面。

“噢，棒极了，苏。”其他孩子都大叫起来。

“并非真的比你射得好，”苏珊对矮人说，“你刚才射箭的时候，我觉得起了点儿微风。”

“不，没起风，”特鲁普金说，“别这么说。我有自知之明，知道自己完败。我甚至不会找借口说当我手臂奋力往后拉弦时上次受伤留下的伤疤牵疼了我……”

“哦，你受伤了？”露西问，“快让我看。”

“这可不适合小女孩看，”特鲁普金开口，但随即他忽然忍住了话头，“瞧，我又像个傻瓜似的说话。”他说，“我猜你很可能是一个出色的外科医生，就像你的哥哥是出色的剑客，或者就像你的姐姐是出色的射手。”他坐在台阶上，脱下他的锁子甲，迅速地脱下小衬衣，露出一条毛茸茸、肌肉发达（就比例而言）的手臂，跟水手胳膊似的，虽然比小孩的胳膊大不了多少。肩膀上的绷带缠得乱七八糟，露西动手解下绷带。绷带下，刀伤看起来很糟糕，肿得厉害。“唉，可怜的特鲁普金，”露西说，“真糟糕。”接着，她小心翼翼地从她的瓶子里倒出一滴药水滴在伤口上。

“嘿。嗯？你做了什么？”特鲁普金问道。可不管他如何转头，斜着眼看，把胡须拂来拂去，他都无法看清楚自己的肩膀。然后他尽可能地去摸，把胳膊和手指伸到很难够着的地方，就像你想要挠痒，但又够不着那地方。然后他摆动手臂，举起手臂，又试着肌肉用力，最后终于跳了起来，大叫道：“天啊！(2)痊愈了！好得跟新的一样。”之后他突然爆发出一阵哈哈大笑，说道：“唉，我出尽了矮人的洋相。我希望没冒犯各位吧？向各位陛下致以我卑微的敬意——卑微的敬意。感谢你们救了我的命，治好了我的伤，请我吃了早饭——还给了我教训。”

孩子们都说没关系，不用谢。

“好了，”彼得说，“要是你真的决定相信我们……”

“我已经决定了。”矮人说。

“我们接下来要做的事情很明确。我们必须立即跟凯斯宾国王会合。”

“越快越好，”特鲁普金说，“我的傻瓜行为已经浪费了一个钟头的时间。”

“大约两天的路程，如果照你来的路径走，”彼得说，“我的意思是就我们而言。我们无法像你们矮人那样没日没夜地走一整天。”他转身面对大家。“特鲁普金说的阿斯兰堡垒显然是石桌那里。你们都记得的，从那里往下，去到贝鲁纳浅滩，大约要走上半天，或者不用半天。”

“我们称之为贝鲁纳桥。”特鲁普金说。

“我们那个时候还没有桥，”彼得说，“然后从贝鲁纳到这里要花一天多一点儿的时间。我们以前通常在第二天下午茶的时候回到家，如果走得慢的话。要是走得快，约一天半的时间我们就能到。”

“但是别忘了，现在到处是森林，”特鲁普金说，“还要避开敌军。”

“听我说，”埃德蒙说，“我们一定要按照我们亲爱的小朋友来的路线走吗？”

“别再那样叫我，陛下，要是你爱我的话。”矮人说。

“好吧，”埃德蒙说，“我可以叫你我们的D．L．F.(3)吗？”

“噢，埃德蒙，”苏珊说，“别老这么逗弄他。”

“没关系，小姑娘——我是说陛下，”特鲁普金笑着说，“开个玩笑无伤大雅。”（那以后他们经常叫他D．L．F.，以至于后来他们几乎都忘记了它的含义。）

“如我刚才所说，”埃德蒙继续道，“我们不需要走那条路。为什么我们不划船南下，抵达清水湾，然后逆流而上？那会将我们带到石桌所在山岭的背面，我们走水路会安全些。要是马上动身出发，我们可以在天黑前赶到清水湾，然后睡上几个钟头，第二天一大早就能见到凯斯宾。”

“了解海岸很重要，”特鲁普金说，“我们对清水湾一无所知。”

“食物怎么办呢？”苏珊说。

“哎呀，我们只好吃苹果将就，”露西说，“快点儿上路吧。到现在，我们还什么都没干呢，而我们在这里都待了差不多两天了。”

“不管怎样，不能再把我的帽子当鱼篓用。”埃德蒙说。

他们把其中一件雨衣当袋子使，包了很多苹果在里面。然后他们在水井那里好好地喝了个够（因为要走到清水湾才能再喝到淡水），接着来到船边。离开凯尔帕拉维尔，孩子们很难过，虽然那里已经沦为废墟，但又开始给他们家的感觉。

“最好让D．L．F.来掌舵，”彼得说，“埃德和我各划一支桨。不过，稍等。我们最好把锁子甲脱下来：还没等到岸，我们就会感觉很热。女孩们最好坐在船首，给D．L．F.喊方向，因为他不认路。你们要好好指路，让我们驶向大海，离开这个岛。”

很快他们离海岛那长满树木、郁郁葱葱的海岸越来越远，小岛的海湾和海岬看起来越来越扁平，小船随着轻柔的海浪上下起伏着。他们周边的大海变得越来越宽广，远处的海水显得更蓝，而紧靠小船的海水却是绿色的，还带着泡沫。空气里都是海盐的味道，四周寂静，只听到海水涌动的哗哗声，海水拍击船身的啪嗒声，船桨划动产生的溅水声，以及桨架震动的声响。太阳慢慢热起来了。

露丝和苏珊坐在船首感觉很惬意，她们弯下腰，试着把手伸进海里，可总够不着。她们可看见船下的海底，海底的沙基本上是纯净洁白的，偶尔见到一块块紫色的海藻。

“真像回到了过去，”露西说，“你还记得我们的海上旅行吗，去了特里宾西尔——还有加尔马——还有七小岛——还有孤独岛？”

“记得，”苏珊说，“还记得我们那条巍峨的大船‘华光号’吗？船头雕成天鹅头那样，那雕刻的天鹅翅膀向后伸展至船腰。”

“还记得那丝绸般的风帆，那些挂在船尾的巨大灯笼吗？”

“还有船尾楼上的盛宴，还有乐手。”

“还记得我们让乐手在帆缆上吹奏长笛，这样乐声听起来就像是来自天上？”

过了一会儿，苏珊接手埃德蒙的桨，他则来到船首跟露西坐在一起。他们已经离开了那座岛，离对岸更近了——那里被森林覆盖，看起来很荒凉。要不是想起了过去那开放、怡人、到处是快活伙伴的日子，他们准会觉得眼前的景色很美。

“唷！划船真是件让人精疲力竭的苦差事。”彼得说。

“让我来划一阵吧？”露西说。

“对你来说船桨太大了。”彼得不耐烦地说，不是因为他脾气坏，而是因为他累得不想费力说话。

第九章　露西见到了什么


绕过最后一个海岬，他们开始了最后的航程，沿着清水湾逆流而上。苏珊和那两个男孩因为划船早就累得够呛，露西头疼起来，那是长时间晒太阳和刺眼的水面反光造成的。就算是特鲁普金都盼着早点儿结束航行。他掌舵坐的凳子是给成年人类而不是给矮人准备的，所以他的脚够不着船板；大家知道，这么坐着哪怕只是十分钟都很难受。随着愈加疲劳，他们的情绪低落下来。此刻之前，他们所想的都是如何跟凯斯宾会合。而现在他们琢磨的是，找到他后他们要做什么，仅凭那么几个矮人和森林生物，如何能打败一支由成年人组成的军队。

当他们缓慢地沿着清水湾弯弯曲曲的水道逆流而上时，暮色逐渐降临。离岸越来越近时，暮色浓重起来，伸展出来的树枝几乎要碰到头。随着身后的大海的声音逐渐减弱，这里显得很静；他们甚至可以听到由森林汇入清水湾的小溪流的潺潺流水声。

他们终于上岸，累到没了生火的心思，哪怕是以苹果做晚餐也比猎捕吃的强（虽然他们大都觉得再也不愿见到苹果了）。默默地嚼了一阵，他们都蜷缩着躺在四棵高大的山毛榉树中间，以苔藓和枯叶为床。

除了露西，其他人都马上进入了梦乡。露西没他们那么累，所以觉得怎么躺都难受。还有，她此时才记起来，矮人都打呼噜。她知道入眠的最好办法之一就是顺其自然，于是她睁开了眼睛。透过凤尾草和树枝的空隙，她仅能见到一片水面及水面之上的天空。接着，她激动地记起来，过了那么多年，她再次见到了明亮的纳尼亚群星。她曾经对这些星星非常熟悉，要比我们现实世界的星星熟悉得多，因为作为纳尼亚的女王之一，比起在英国作为一个小孩子的她来说，她睡得要晚很多。它们就在天上——从她躺着的位置，可以见到至少三个夏日的星座：轮船星座、锤子星座，还有豹子星座。“亲爱的老豹子星。”她高兴地自言自语。

不但没有更多睡意，她反倒变得更清醒了——一种奇怪的、夜间做梦般的清醒。清水湾更亮了。她知道此时月亮正高悬在水面之上，虽然她看不到月亮。此刻她开始感到整座森林跟她一样，正在苏醒。几乎不知不觉地，她快速起身，离开他们的露营地，往远走了一点儿。

“可爱的夜晚。”露西自语道。夜晚凉爽，清新，到处弥漫着香气。她听到一只夜莺在近处叽喳鸣叫，正要开唱，时而中断，时而开声。前方光线较亮。于是她朝光亮处走去，来到一处地方，那里树木没有那么密集，能见到一块块或一片片的月光，月光与阴影交错着，以至于你几乎难以确定周围有些什么，它们又在哪里。此时，夜莺总算满意地定好了调子，突然尽情高歌起来。

露西的眼睛开始适应了这里的光线亮度，可以更清晰地看清离她最近的树木。她心头涌起了对往昔的强烈渴望，那时纳尼亚的树木能交谈。但愿她能将他们唤醒，她清楚地知道那里每棵树是如何诉说的，他会呈现出哪种人类形体。她看着一棵银白色的桦树：她的声音会像是轻柔的阵雨，她看似一个苗条的少女，头发在脸庞边飞扬，喜欢跳舞。她看了看橡树：他会是一个满脸皱纹但精神矍铄的老人，胡子拳曲，脸上手上都长有疣子，疣子上有毛发长出来。她看着那棵山毛榉，她正站在她下面。啊！——她会是他们当中最美的。她会是一个优雅的女神，温和而高贵，是林中淑女。

“啊，树呀，树呀，”露西说着（虽然她本不打算说话的），“啊，树木们呀，醒来吧，醒来吧。你们都忘了吗？你们不记得我了吗？树精们，树神们，出来，到我这儿来吧。”

尽管周围没有一丝风，她身边的树木却晃动起来。树叶发出的沙沙声像是话语。那只夜莺停下了歌唱，仿佛在倾听。露西觉得她随时都能一下子明白树想要说的话。可那个时刻没有到来。沙沙声逐渐消失。夜莺继续它的歌声。虽然是在月光下，树林却又显得更平淡了。可露西感觉自己漏掉了什么（这种感觉类似你有时想要努力回忆某个名字或者日期，几乎就要想起来了，可还没真想起来就消失了）：仿佛她跟树木说话时出了差错，说早了一瞬间，也可能是晚了一瞬间，也许一句话没说对，也可能用错了一个字。

突如其来地她困倦起来。她走回露营地，紧挨着苏珊和彼得躺下来，没几分钟就睡着了。

寒冷沉闷的清晨将他们唤醒，树林透来的晨光灰蒙蒙的（因为太阳还没升起），一切都肮脏潮湿。

“苹果，嘿嗬，”特鲁普金苦笑着，“我得说，你们这些古代的国王和女王不肯让你们的廷臣吃太饱！”

他们站起来，抖了抖身子，观察四周。树木稠密，无论哪个方向，目力能及不过几码距离。

“我猜众位陛下是认得路的吧？”矮人说。

“我不认得，”苏珊说，“我以前从没见过这片树林。实际上，我一路上都在琢磨，我们本该沿着河走。”

“我觉得你当时就该提出来。”彼得说，他的尖刻情有可原。

“唉，别在意她，”埃德蒙说，“她一直是个扫兴的人。彼得，你带了袖珍指南针，对吗？那样的话，我们会一切顺利的。我们只需要一直往西北方向走……跨过那条小河，那条河叫什么来着？……拉什河……”

“我知道，”彼得说，“那条在贝鲁纳浅滩与大河交汇的河流，或者贝鲁纳桥，照D．L．F.的说法。”

“没错。跨过那条河，然后上山，在八九点钟前我们就能抵达石桌（我的意思是，阿斯兰堡垒）。希望凯斯宾国王会好好招待我们一顿早餐！”

“我希望你没弄错，”苏珊说，“我都完全不记得这些方位了。”

“女孩这方面最差劲了，”埃德蒙跟彼得和矮人说，“她们脑子里根本就没有地图的概念。”

“那是因为我们脑子里装着别的东西。”露西说。

起初一切似乎很顺利。他们甚至以为走的是过去的老路；可如果你对树林了解一二的话，你就会知道行人很容易走上自己想象出来的路。这些路大约五分钟后就消失，接着你觉得又找到了另一条路（同时希望那不是另一条路而是先前的那条），可那条路也不见了，直到你大大偏离了正确的方向，你才意识到刚才那些根本就不是路。不过，男孩们和矮人熟悉树林，没怎么被哄住。

他们缓慢艰难地走了约半个小时（其中三人因昨天划船酸痛得不行），这时特鲁普金突然低声道：“停。”他们都停了下来。“有东西跟着我们，”他压低嗓子说，“更确切地说，有东西跟上我们了：就在左边。”他们都一动不动地站着，凝神倾听和观察，弄得耳朵眼都疼起来了。“你我最好把箭搭在弦上。”苏珊跟矮人说。矮人点点头，等两把弓箭都备战好，一行人又继续前行。

他们在很开阔的林地走了几十码远，密切地警戒着。然后他们来到一处地方，这里灌木丛密集起来，他们要挨着树丛走过那里。就在他们要走过那地方时，突然间什么东西号叫着快速掠过，迅捷得像雷电一样从断裂的树枝中冲了出来。露西给撞倒，喘息着，倒地时听到嘣的弓弦声。等她反应过来，见到一头可怕的大灰熊倒地死了，身上插着特鲁普金的箭。

“D．L．F.在这场射箭比试中赢了你，苏。”彼得说，笑容有些勉强。这场惊险把他也吓得不轻。

“我……我把箭射晚了，”苏珊声音尴尬地说，“我很担心它可能是，你知道的……我们那些熊之一，一头会说话的熊。”她讨厌杀生。

“这正是麻烦之处，”特鲁普金说，“大部分野兽成了对手，不会说话，可还存在一些另类。你根本分辨不了，也不敢拖延。”

“可怜的老布鲁因，”苏珊说，“你觉得不会是他吧？”

“不是他，”小矮人说，“我见到了脸，听到了号叫。它就是想把小女孩当早餐。既然说到早餐，当你们提到你们希望凯斯宾国王会好好招待你们一顿，我当时不想让各位陛下泄气：可营地里肉类很少。熊肉吃起来不错。白扔了尸体，不带点儿走可惜了，再说那花不了半个钟头。我猜你们两个年轻人……应该说，国王……知道怎么剥熊皮吧？”

“咱们走远点儿再坐下，”苏珊对露西说，“我知道那是多恶心的事。”露西抖了一下，点头同意。坐下后，她说：“我刚刚想到一个可怕的想法，苏。”

“什么想法？”

“要是某天在我们自己的世界里，家里的那个，人们内心魔化，就像这里的动物一样，可看起来还是人样，以至于你根本就分不出来谁是谁？”

“眼下纳尼亚的麻烦就够操心的了，”务实的苏珊说，“不要胡思乱想这些了。”

等她们跟男孩们和矮人会合，他们尽可能多地携带割下的精熊肉。把生肉装进口袋里很恶心，但他们用新鲜树叶把肉包裹起来，尽力为之。他们都有足够的经验，知道等走得饥肠辘辘时，这些让人难受的又湿又软的小包裹就不会让人反感了。

他们继续跋涉（经过第一条小溪时，他们停下把那三双需要清洗的手给洗了），一直走到太阳升起，小鸟开始唱歌，多得让人心烦的苍蝇在蕨丛里嗡嗡叫着。昨天划船造成的酸痛感开始消退。大家的情绪开始好转。阳光更暖和了，他们摘下头盔，拿在手里。

“我想我们没走错方向吧？”约一小时后埃德蒙说。

“只要我们走得不是太靠左，我不认为我们会走错方向，”彼得说，“要是我们走得太靠右，最坏的结果不过是没能走捷径而是朝大河的方向走，那不过是多费一点儿时间罢了。”

于是他们继续前行，没人出声，只听到沉闷的脚步声和锁子甲发出的叮当声。

“那条可恶的拉什河到底在哪儿？”过了很久埃德蒙说道。

“我确实觉得我们早该走到了，”彼得说，“可别无他法，只好继续走。”他们俩都知道矮人正焦急地看着他们，可他没吭声。

于是他们仍得艰难地前进，身上的锁子甲开始变得沉重闷热起来。

“到底怎么回事？”彼得突然说。

他们已经不知不觉地几乎走到了一个小断崖边上，从断崖上俯视下面的峡谷，谷底有条河流。对岸隔得很远的峭壁要高很多。他们这群人里除了埃德蒙（也许还有特鲁普金），谁都不擅长攀岩。

“对不起，”彼得说，“我带你们走错路了。我们迷路了。我以前从未见过这个地方。”

小矮人咬着牙低低地吹了声口哨。

“哎呀，我们回去走另一条路，”苏珊说，“我就知道我们准得在这片树林里迷路。”

“苏珊！”露西责备地说，“别那样抱怨彼得。那太差劲，他尽力了。”

“你也别那样指责苏，”埃德蒙说，“我觉得她说得很对。”

“天啊！”(1)特鲁普金叫起来，“如果来的时候就迷路了，我们有多少机会能原路返回？要是我们退回到小岛，再从头来过……就算我们能办到……我们还不如就此放弃了。照这样的速度在我们赶到那里前，米亚兹早就把凯斯宾消灭了。”

“你认为我们应该继续往前？”露西说。

“我不确定至尊王真的迷路了，”特鲁普金说，“这条河怎么就不能是那条拉什河呢？”

“因为拉什河不在峡谷里。”彼得竭力忍住怒气。

“陛下说的是不在，”矮人回答，“可你不是该说从前不在吗？你所了解的纳尼亚是几百年前的事，甚至是一千年前的事。难道它不会改变吗？一次山崩很可能把那座山削掉一半，就光剩下岩石，然后成了峡谷那一头的峭壁。接着，拉什河有可能年复一年地冲刷、加深河道，最后成了峡谷这一头的小峭壁。或者以前可能发生过一次地震，或者其他任何事。”

“我还没这么想过。”彼得说。

“不管怎样，”特鲁普金继续道，“就算这条河不是拉什河，可它大致流向北方，所以它终将汇入大河。我觉得在我来的路上，我路过的某处，很可能就是那条河。所以，要是我们往下游靠右走的话，就会走到那条大河。也许不像我们原来想的那么乐观，但至少不会比走我的原路糟糕。”

“特鲁普金，你真够朋友，”彼得说，“那走吧。从峡谷的这边往下走。”

“看！看！看！”露西叫起来。

“哪里？什么？”大家问道。

“狮子，”露西说，“阿斯兰。你们没见到？”她脸色完全变了，眼睛发亮。

“你难道是指……？”彼得开口。

“你以为在哪儿见到他？”苏珊问。

“别像大人那样讲话，”露西跺着脚说，“不是我以为见到他，而是我见到他。”

“哪儿呢，露？”彼得问。

“就在那上面，在山上那些白蜡树中间。不，是峡谷的这一头。是上面，不是下面。正好跟你们想去的方向相反。而且他想要我们到他那里去……去那头的上面。”

“你怎么知道他想让我们这么做？”埃德蒙问。

“他……我……我就是知道，”露西说，“从他脸上看出来的。”

其他人彼此对视着，很疑惑，不吭声。

“女王陛下很可能是见到了一头狮子，”特鲁普金插嘴，“我听说，这片树林有些狮子。可不一定就是一头友善会说话的狮子，就像刚才那头熊不是一头友好会说话的熊一样。”

“噢，别傻了，”露西说，“你以为我见了阿斯兰都认不出来吗？”

“就算他是你过去了解的那头狮子，”特鲁普金说，“他现在也是一头很年迈的狮子了！而且就算他跟从前一个模样，难道他就不可能跟其他野兽一样变野变蠢？”

露西气红了脸，要不是彼得拉着她的胳膊，我想她会扑向特鲁普金。“D．L．F.不理解。他怎会理解？特鲁普金，你得明白，我们的确熟悉阿斯兰；我是说，很熟悉。你不要再那样谈论他。那么说一方面是不吉利的，另一方面纯粹是胡说八道。唯一的疑惑是阿斯兰是否真的在那边。”

“可我知道他刚才在的。”露西说，眼里噙满了泪水。

“好吧，露，可我们不知道，你明白吗。”彼得说。

“别无他法，只好投票决定。”埃德蒙说。

“好吧，”彼得回答，“D．L．F.，你是最年长的。你投什么票？上还是下？”

“下，”矮人说，“我对阿斯兰一无所知。但我确实知道要是左转，顺着峡谷往上爬的话，我们可能要走上一天才能找到能过河的地方。可要是我们右转，往下走的话，我们肯定能在几个小时左右抵达大河。要是附近真有狮子的话，我们需要远离它们，而不是靠近它们。”

“你怎么看，苏珊？”

“别生气，露，”苏珊说，“可我确实觉得我们应该往下走。累死了。咱们赶紧走出这片讨厌的树林，进入开阔地。而且，除了你，我们谁也没见到什么。”

“埃德蒙？”彼得问。

“好吧，有那么一条，”埃德蒙脸色发红，说话很快，“一年前当我们第一次发现纳尼亚的时候……或者说一千年前，怎么说都行……是露西第一个发现纳尼亚的，而我们谁都不肯信她。当时我是最不信的，我知道。可最终她是对的。这次我们信她，这是不是公平些？我赞成往上走。”

“啊，埃德！”露西说着握住他的手。

“现在该你了，彼得，”苏珊说，“我真希望……”

“噢，闭嘴，闭嘴，让我想想，”彼得打断她，“我更宁愿弃权。”

“你是至尊王。”特鲁普金严厉地说。

“下，”过了很久，彼得说，“我知道露西最终可能是正确的，可我没办法。我们必须两者择一。”

就这样，他们靠右出发，沿着崖边往下游走。露西走在这群人的最后，伤心地哭泣着。

第十章　阿斯兰归来


沿着峡谷边缘行走可不像看起来的那么容易。没走多少码，他们就被长在悬崖边的冷杉幼林挡住了去路。他们试图穿越这片树林，弯着腰挣扎行进了约十分钟，才意识到在这片林子里走半英里就得花上一个钟头。他们只好返回重新来过，决定绕着杉树林走。这使得他们大大偏离了原定的右边方向，远得看不见悬崖，听不到河流声，这时他们开始担心他们完全走错了。没人知道几点，但气温最高的正午时分差不多到了。

当他们最后总算走回到峡谷边上时，发现他们这一侧的峡谷峭壁要低矮得多，比他们的出发地低了约一英里，而且更崎岖。他们很快找到了一条路径，爬下了峡谷，沿着河边继续他们的行程。不过在继续之前，他们先停下歇息了一会儿，喝足了水。没人再谈起跟凯斯宾一块共进午餐甚或是晚餐的事了。

明智的做法不是在峡谷顶上走而是挨着拉什河走。这能确保他们走对方向：遭遇了那片杉树林后，他们一直担心会不由自主地偏离路线太远，在树林里迷路。那片树林古老，无路可行，在那里面根本没法走直路。大片大片令人绝望的荆棘，倒伏的大树，泥泞的沼泽，茂密的矮树丛，总是层出不穷地挡住他们的去路。不过，拉什河峡谷也根本不是一个好行走的地方。我是说，对匆忙赶路的人来说不是个好地方。可要是午后漫游，再来上一份野外茶点，那倒是令人愉悦的。就游览而言，这里的景致应有尽有：轰鸣的瀑布，银色的飞流，琥珀色的深潭，爬满青苔的岩石，岸边的深苔，深得一脚踩下可陷及脚踝，各种蕨类植物，宝石一般的蜻蜓，时不时有鹰在头顶掠过，还见到了一只雕（彼得和特鲁普金都这么认为）。不过，当然啦，孩子们和矮人最想见到的就是他们下方的大河，还有贝鲁纳浅滩，以及去向阿斯兰堡垒的路径。

越继续前行，拉什河流经的地方越陡峭。他们更多是在爬行，而不是在行走——在有些地方，他们很艰险地攀爬，要翻过滑溜的岩石，身下就是幽暗的深谷，谷底是轰鸣湍急的河流。

你可以想见他们如何急切地查看左边悬崖，想找到任何裂口或任何能攀爬的缝隙；可那些悬崖险得很。这真让人发疯，因为大家都知道，只要走出峡谷，他们只需要越过一个缓坡，再走上一小段路就能到达凯斯宾的指挥部。

男孩们和矮人都赞成现在生火烤熊肉吃。苏珊不想这么干；像她说的，她只想“继续走，走到头，走出这些讨厌的树林”。露西太累太难受，顾不上思考什么。可既然没有干柴可寻，任何想法都不再重要。男孩们开始动起了心思，不知道生肉是不是真像人家说的那样尝起来恶心。特鲁普金向他们保证确实如此。

当然啦，要是几天前在英国让孩子们经历如此旅程，他们早就累垮了。之前我已经解释过纳尼亚如何改造他们了。哪怕是露西，可以说，如今的她只剩下三分之一还是那个第一次上寄宿学校的小女孩，另外三分之二是纳尼亚的露西女王。

“总算走出来了！”苏珊说。

“啊，万岁！”彼得说。

河谷在此转弯，他们身下的景色一览无遗。他们看到脚下开阔的原野一直延伸到天际，原野与他们之间隔着大河，像一条宽阔的银色带子。他们看到那处特别宽且浅的河滩，那里曾经是贝鲁纳浅滩，但如今立起了一座长长的多孔拱桥。桥的远处有一座小镇。

“天啊，”埃德蒙说，“我们就在小镇那里打了贝鲁纳战役！”

没有什么比这更能振奋两个男孩了。当再次见到几百年前曾经赢得一场辉煌战役的地方，你会情不自禁地豪气倍增，更别提那场胜利赢得了一个王国。彼得和埃德蒙津津有味地谈论着那场战役，忘却了脚的酸痛和肩背上盔甲的沉重。矮人也听得入神。

大家都加快脚步继续前行。路好走了些。尽管他们左边还是陡峭的悬崖，不过他们右侧的地面坡度趋于缓和。很快他们走出了陡峭的峡谷，面前是一片山谷。这里没有了瀑布，他们很快进入了一片密林。

接着，很突然地“嗖”的一声，听起来很像啄木鸟发出的啄木声。孩子们还在寻思多年前在哪里听到过类似的声响，还纳闷为什么他们讨厌这个声音，这时就听到特鲁普金大喊：“趴下！”同时把他身旁的露西拽倒在蕨丛中。彼得，正抬起头来看是否来了一只松鼠，明白了那是什么声音——一支长利箭擦过他的头顶扎入了树干。他刚把苏珊拽倒，自己趴下，另一支箭刺耳地擦过他的肩头，射入了他身旁的地面。

“快！快！后退！爬行！”特鲁普金喘着气说。

他们转身，扭动着身子爬上山坡，身下是蕨草，周边是讨厌的嗡嗡叫的成群蝇虫。箭矢在他们身边嗖嗖地掠过。一支箭射中了苏珊的头盔，发出砰的一声锐响后弹开。他们加速爬行，大汗淋漓。接着他们跑了起来，几乎呈九十度猫着腰。男孩们把剑握在手里，免得被剑绊倒。

太令人沮丧了，又得重新上坡，重走刚才走过的路。当他们觉得再也跑不动时，哪怕就是为了逃命，他们全都累倒在瀑布边的一块大石后，倒在潮湿的苔藓上，上气不接下气。见到自己居然爬了这么高，他们都吃了一惊。

他们凝神倾听，没有听到追踪的声响。

“没事了，”特鲁普金说，深吸了一口气，“他们没搜查树林。看来那些仅是哨兵。不过，那就意味着米亚兹在那里设了哨所。该死的！(1)刚才可真险。”

“把大家带上这条路，我真该掴自己的脑袋。”彼得说。

“恰恰相反，陛下，”矮人说，“原因之一，不是你，而是你的御弟，埃德蒙国王，是他最早建议我们走清水湾这条路。”

“恐怕D．L．F.说对了。”埃德蒙说，出状况以来他的确把这点给忘掉了。

“原因之二，”特鲁普金继续道，“要是刚才照我的路线走，我们要么直接走入那个新哨所的伏击范围，极有这个可能；要么为避开那个哨所我们也至少得遭遇同样的麻烦。我认为，这条清水湾路线实际上是最佳的路线。”

“因祸得福。”苏珊说。

“这祸可够大的！”埃德蒙说。

“我想我们现在只能沿着峡谷往上走。”露西说。

“露，你真是个好人，”彼得说，“你本可以说‘早该听我的’，可你没有。上路吧。”

“等我们进入树林，”特鲁普金说，“不管你们说什么，我都要生火做晚餐。不过得先离开这里。”

他们如何艰难返回不必赘述。虽然艰难，可奇怪的是，大家开朗起来。他们正缓过劲来，而且“晚餐”一词效果非凡。

他们来到那片曾给他们带来很多麻烦的杉树林，这时天色尚未暗下来，他们在一个低洼处扎营。捡拾柴火很乏味，可当篝火燃起，那感觉好极了。他们开始拿出潮湿、油污的一包包熊肉，对那些居家人士来说，这可够恶心的。矮人对烹调很有心得。他们把仅剩的几个苹果裹在熊肉里——就像是苹果馅饼，不过用的是熊肉而非面皮，而且外皮更厚实——然后串在尖木棍上烤。苹果汁渗进肉里，像是烤猪肉用的苹果酱。常以肉为食的熊，肉质不佳，但食用过大量蜂蜜和水果的熊则肉质鲜美，这头熊正好是后者。这真是一顿美餐。而且，当然啦，无须清洗餐具，光是靠着、望着特鲁普金烟斗冒出的烟，舒展疲惫的腿脚，聊着天。每个人都乐观起来，相信第二天就能找到凯斯宾国王，几天后就能打败米亚兹。这些想法可能不够理性，可他们就是那么想的。

很快，他们一个接一个地睡着了。

露西从熟睡中醒来，感觉到这世上她最喜欢的声音在呼唤她的名字。她起初以为那是爸爸的声音，可又不像。接着她以为是彼得的声音，可那也不像。她不想起来，不是因为她还累着——正相反，她休息得很好，骨头的酸痛都消失了——而是因为她感觉太幸福太舒服了。她仰望着纳尼亚明月，那月亮比我们的大，仰望着星空，因为他们露营的地方相对来说较为空旷。

“露西。”呼唤声再次响起，不是爸爸也不是彼得的声音。她坐起身，颤抖起来，是因为激动而不是害怕。月光明亮，她周围的树林景色很清晰，像白昼一样，但看起来更野性。她身后是杉树林；右边是参差的悬崖顶，耸立在峡谷的对面；正前方，是一片开阔的草地，草地的一箭开外是一片林地。露西仔细盯着那处树木。

“哎呀，我确信他们在移动，”她自言自语，“他们在走动。”

她站起来，心跳得厉害，朝他们走去。千真万确，林地传来一种声音，就像是大风天树木的哗哗声，可今晚没风。但又不完全是一般的树林声。露西觉得其中有种旋律，可她无法捕捉到那种旋律，就像前一晚她没能弄明白树木几乎要对她倾诉的话语。但至少，她听出一种轻快的调子；走近时，她发觉自己的脚不由自主地跳起舞来。此时，确信无疑，那些树真的在移动——彼此交错地移动，仿佛在跳一支复杂的乡村舞。“我想，”露西寻思，“树要是跳舞，那肯定是田园舞。”她此时几乎置身其中。

她见到的第一株树，一眼看去根本不像棵树，更像是一个魁梧的男人，胡须乱蓬蓬的，毛发浓密。她没被吓到：她过去见过这类东西。可再一看，他又成了一棵树，虽然还在移动。当然啦，你看不出来他是否有脚或是树根，因为树移动时，他们不是走在地面上；他们在土里移动，就像我们在蹚水一样。她所见的每一棵树都发生了类似的情形。他们时而形似友好可爱的男女巨人，当善意的魔法将树人完全唤醒时，他们就会呈现巨人形状；时而又化身为树。当他们呈现树形时，他们看似是古怪的人形树，而当他们看似是人时，他们又似古怪的长着枝干树叶的人。那怪异而悦耳、带有沙沙声的惬意声音一直响着。

“他们就要苏醒了，但还不完全。”露西说道。她清楚自己是完全清醒的，比谁都清醒。

她毫无畏惧地走到他们中间，不时跳着避开，免得被这些高大的伙伴撞上。不过，她对他们的兴趣倒是不大。她想穿过他们，走近某种东西；那亲切的呼唤声是从树林外传来的。

她很快就穿越了他们（不知是她用手臂将树枝推开，还是手拉着这些高大的舞者，加入了他们的行列，他们要弯下身来才够得着她），这些树木围成一圈，环绕着一片空地。她从他们不断变换交错着的可爱光影中走了出来。

一圈青草地，平整得跟修剪过的草坪一样，展现在她眼前，周边幽暗的树木在跳着舞。于是——啊，欢欣鼓舞！他在那儿：那高大的狮王，在月光下白得发亮，身下投下他巨大的黑色影子。

他要不是摆动着尾巴，就跟石狮一个样，不过，露西根本不那么想。她压根就没想过这头狮子友善与否。她冲向他，要是不马上这么做，她觉得自己的心就要爆裂。下一刻她发觉自己正亲吻着他，手臂尽可能地环抱着他的脖子，脸埋在他那美丽浓密如丝般光滑的鬃毛里。

“阿斯兰，阿斯兰，亲爱的阿斯兰，”露西啜泣着，“终于来了。”

那巨兽侧躺下来，让露西半坐半倚在他的前爪间。他倾身向前，舌头舔了舔她的鼻子。他温暖的气息包围着她。她抬头凝视着那巨大、智慧的脸庞。

“欢迎，孩子。”他说。

“阿斯兰，”露西说，“你变得更高大了。”

“那是因为你岁数增长了，小家伙。”他回答。

“难道不是因为你也年长了吗？”

“我不会老。但你每长大一岁，就会发现我变得更高大。”

她一度太高兴了，不愿说话。但阿斯兰开了口。

“露西，”他说，“我们不能长时间在这儿躺着。你现在有事要做，今天浪费了很多时间。”

“是的，很遗憾。”露西说，“我明明见到你了。他们不肯相信我。他们都那么……”

阿斯兰的身体深处传来一声极低沉的吼声。

“对不起，”露西多少明白他的情绪，“我并不想说别人的坏话。可怎么说那不是我的错，不是吗？”

狮王直视着她的眼睛。

“噢，阿斯兰，”露西说，“难道说你认为是我的错？我怎么能……我无法丢下其他人只身来找你，我怎么能？别那么看着我……好吧，我想我当时能的。嗯，我知道，要是跟你一起，我不会是独自一个。可那又有什么用呢？”

阿斯兰没吭声。

“你是说，”露西弱弱地说，“那样一切会顺利……会多少好起来？可如何会好起来？求你了，阿斯兰！我不能知道吗？”

“想知道那会发生什么，孩子？”阿斯兰说，“没法知道。没人能预知。”

“天啊。”露西说。

“要行动了才知道那会发生什么，”阿斯兰说，“要是你现在回到他们身边，把他们叫醒，告诉他们你又再次见到了我，告诉他们必须马上起来跟你走，那样会发生什么？要知道答案只有一种方式。”

“你想要我这么做？”露西吃惊地说。

“是的，小家伙。”阿斯兰说。

“其他人能看得见你吗？”露西询问。

“开始肯定看不见，”阿斯兰说，“后面会看见，那要视情形而定。”

“可他们不会信我的！”露西说。

“不要紧。”阿斯兰说。

“天啊，天啊，”露西说，“刚才很高兴再次见到你。我还以为你会让我留下。我以为你会咆哮而来，把所有的敌人都吓跑，就像上次一样。可现在一切都不妙。”

“这对你而言是艰难的，小家伙，”阿斯兰说，“可事情不会以同样的方式发生两次。我们大家在纳尼亚一直以来都很艰难。”

露西把头埋进他的鬃毛，以避开看他的脸。他的鬃毛里一定有某种魔力。她感觉到狮子般的力量注入她的身体。猛地，她坐了起来。

“对不起，阿斯兰，”她说，“我现在准备好了。”

“你现在有了狮子的力量，”阿斯兰说，“纳尼亚将要复兴。来吧。我们得抓紧时间。”

他起身，迈着庄严无声的步子走向那圈舞动的树木，露西刚才就是穿越他们而来。露西跟着狮子，颤抖的手拉着他的鬃毛。树木为他们让路，有那么一瞬间他们完全化身为人。露西见到高大可爱的树神和林间仙女纷纷向狮王躬身致意；下一瞬间他们又变回树木，依然鞠躬致敬，优雅地摆动着枝干，像是一种舞蹈。

“好了，孩子，”走出树林后阿斯兰说，“我在此等候。去把其他人唤醒，叫他们跟你走。要是他们不肯，那么至少你只身跟随我。”

要把那四个年纪比你大又疲惫至极的人叫醒可真不容易，更何况就为了跟他们说些他们或许不信的话，而且让他们做他们肯定不愿干的事。“我不要去想，只要做就好了。”露西心想。

她先走向彼得，摇晃他。“彼得，”她在他耳边低语，“醒来。快。阿斯兰来了。他说我们得马上跟他走。”

“当然，露。照你的意思办。”彼得的回答出人意料。这让人振奋，可下一秒彼得翻了一个身又睡了过去，没多少用。

下一个是苏珊。苏珊确实醒了过来，但只是用她那很令人讨厌的大人腔说：“你在做梦吧，露西。接着睡吧。”

下一个她去对付埃德蒙。费了很大劲儿才把他给弄醒，不过她终于成功了，他是真醒了，坐了起来。

“嗯？”他不高兴地说，“你说什么呢？”

她又说了一遍。这是最难做的部分之一，因为她每讲一次，可信度就降低一次。

“阿斯兰！”埃德蒙说，跳了起来，“好哇！在哪儿呢？”

露西转身对着一个方向，她能看见狮王正等在那里，他那耐心的眼睛注视着她。“那里。”她手指着那里。

“哪有？”埃德蒙又问。

“那里。那里。你看不到吗？就在树的这一头。”

埃德蒙仔细看了一会儿，然后说道：“看不见。那里什么也没有。月光弄花了你的眼，看错了。人有时候会这样，你懂的。我刚才有一刻还以为自己见到了什么呢。那只是一种光学上叫作什么的现象。”

“我一直都能看见他，”露西说，“他正看着我们呢。”

“那为什么我看不见他？”

“他说过你可能看不到。”

“为什么？”

“不清楚。他就是那么说的。”

“唉，真麻烦，”埃德蒙说，“我真希望你不要有幻视的毛病。不过，我觉得还是叫醒其他人吧。”

第十一章　狮吼


等大家终于都醒来时，露西不得不第四次重复她的故事。紧接着的沉默令人沮丧极了。

“我什么都没看到，”彼得说，眼睛都看酸了，“你看得到吗，苏珊？”

“不，当然看不到，”苏珊没好气地说，“因为那里什么都没有。她刚才是做梦呢。快躺下睡觉，露西。”

“我真的希望，”露西声音颤抖，“你们都跟我走。因为……因为不管是否有人跟我去，我都要跟他走。”

“别胡说，露西，”苏珊说，“你当然不能自己一个人走掉。别让她这么干，彼得。她根本就是在淘气。”

“我跟她去，要是她一定要走的话，”埃德蒙说，“以前她就没说错。”

“我知道她过去是对的，”彼得说，“今早上她也有可能是对的。往峡谷下方走肯定是行不通了。可，夜这么深。而且为什么阿斯兰不肯出现在我们面前？他过去可不这样。这不像他。D．L．F.怎么看？”

“唉，我无话可说，”矮人回答，“要是你们都走，当然，我会跟你们走；可如果你们要分开走，我会跟随至尊王。这是我对他和凯斯宾国王应尽的本分。不过，既然你们问到我个人的看法，我是个普通的矮人，我认为，要是白天都找不到路，那么晚上找到路的机会就更少了。我不相信所谓的神奇狮子，他是能言狮却又不说话，友善可又不帮助我们，庞然巨狮但又无人看到。照我看来，那都是无稽之谈。”

“他正用爪子敲击地面催促我们赶紧走，”露西说，“我们必须现在走。至少我走定了。”

“你没有权力这样逼迫其他人。现在是四比一，你又是最小的。”苏珊说。

“唉，赶快吧，”埃德蒙怒吼，“我们得出发。不走就不得安生。”他打算完全支持露西，可又恼火于失去夜间睡眠，作为补偿他做什么事都肆意地怄气。

“那么，出发吧。”彼得说，疲倦地把盾牌带子套在手臂上，戴上头盔。换作其他时候，他会对露西说些宽慰的话，她是他最喜欢的妹妹，因为他知道她现在一定很难过，也知道所发生的一切都不是她的过错。可他还是忍不住有点儿烦她。

苏珊最不高兴。“要是我跟露西一样任性，”她说，“我就赖在这里不走，不管你们其他人走不走。我真觉得我要这么办。”

“请服从至尊王，女王陛下，”特鲁普金说，“大家出发吧。既然睡不成，我宁愿上路而不愿站在这里聊天。”

于是他们终于行动起来。露西打头阵，咬着唇忍着没把想对苏珊说的话说出来。当她注视阿斯兰时，就把抱怨的话忘掉了。他转身，步子缓慢地走在他们前方，距离他们约三十码。其他人只好由露西引路，因为他们即看不见也听不见阿斯兰。他那猫样的巨大爪子落在草地上，悄无声息。

他领他们来到跳舞树的右侧——那些树木是否还在跳着舞，没人知道，因为露西的眼睛只看着狮王，其他人眼睛看着她——这里离峡谷边缘更近了。“天啊！(1)”特鲁普金心想，“希望这场疯狂不要以月下攀岩和摔断脖子为终结。”

沿着悬崖顶，阿斯兰领着他们走了很长一段路。他们来到悬崖边，崖边生长着一些小树。他转个身，消失在树丛中。露西屏住呼吸，他看似跳了崖；她刚才忙于盯着他的身影，根本没来得及阻止和思考。她加快脚步，很快来到树丛中。往下看去，能见到岩石间有一条陡而窄的小径歪斜地通向谷底，阿斯兰正沿着小径往下走。他转身，开心地看着她。露西拍了拍手，跟着他往下爬。她听到身后传来其他人的叫喊：“喂！露西！当心，天啊。你就在悬崖边上。回来……”过了一会儿，埃德蒙的声音传来：“不，她是对的。这里有下去的路。”

往下走到半路，埃德蒙赶上了她。

“瞧！”他激动地说，“瞧！我们前方那正向下爬行的影子是什么？”

“那是他的影子。”露西说。

“我确信你是对的，露，”埃德蒙说，“我想不出怎么之前我就看不见呢。可他现在在哪儿？”

“有影子就有他，当然啦。你没看到他吗？”

“哦，我几乎以为自己看到了……有那么一瞬间。光线不太好。”

“继续走，埃德蒙国王，继续走。”特鲁普金的声音从后上方传来。接着，后面更远几乎还在崖顶的地方，传来彼得的说话声：“唉，振作起来，苏珊。我拉着你的手。哎呀，就算小孩也能从这里下来。别再发牢骚了。”

几分钟后，他们来到崖底，水流的轰鸣声响彻耳边。阿斯兰像猫一样优雅地踏着步子，踩着水中一块块石头过河。过河中途，他停下，弯腰饮水，当他抬起毛发蓬松、滴着水的脑袋时，他再次转身面对他们。这次埃德蒙见到他了。“啊，阿斯兰！”他大喊着，冲上前去。但他快速转身，开始轻步登上拉什河对岸的山坡。

“彼得，彼得，”埃德蒙大喊，“你看到了吗？”

“我看到某种东西，”彼得说，“可月光下什么都看不清。还是继续走吧，向露西致以三声欢呼。而且现在感觉不那么累了。”

毫不迟疑地，阿斯兰领着他们往左边去，攀上峡谷的更高处。整个行程古怪，如梦境一般——轰鸣的河流，湿润的阴暗草地，越来越近、若隐若现的悬崖，前方总有一头神气的狮子在悄无声息地漫步。除了苏珊和矮人，现在每个人都能看到他了。

很快，他们来到另一条陡峭的小路，通向更高处的悬崖。这些峭壁比他们刚爬下的那些要高得多，攀登这些峭壁是漫长、乏味，而又曲曲折折的。幸运的是，月亮正悬挂在峡谷上方，照亮了峡谷两边。

当阿斯兰的后腿和尾巴在崖顶消失不见时，露西惊得几乎喘不上气来。但她凝聚起最后的力量，随他而上，结果发现来到一个山坡，这时她已经双腿颤抖、气喘吁吁了，自离开清水湾以来，这里就是他们一直努力要到达的地方。坡度和缓的长坡一直向前延伸（石南、青草，还有一些巨石在月光下闪着白光），直至消失在约半英里外若隐若现的树林里。她知道，那里是石桌所在的山冈。

随着盔甲的叮当声，在她身后，其他人爬了上来。阿斯兰在他们前方行进，他们走在他身后。

“露西。”苏珊很小声地说。

“怎么啦？”露西应道。

“我现在看见他了。对不起。”

“没关系。”

“可我比你所了解的还要差劲。我确实相信是他——阿斯兰，我意思是——就在昨天，当他警告我们不要下到杉树林的时候。今晚当你叫醒我们的时候，我确信是他。我是说，内心深处是信的。或者说我会信的，要是愿意的话。可我光想着离开树林，而且……唉，我不知道怎么回事。我怎么跟他说呢？”

“也许你并不需要解释那么多。”露西建议道。

很快，他们来到那片树林，透过林子孩子们看得见那座大山丘，阿斯兰堡垒，那是在他们的统治时代之后建造在石桌之上的。

“我们这边没做好哨卫，”特鲁普金咕哝着抱怨，“我们早该被拦住盘问了……”

“安静！”其他四人同时出声，因为此时阿斯兰停步，转身面对着他们，神色庄严得让他们既喜又怕。男孩们大步向前，露西给他们让路，苏珊和矮人往后缩。

“啊，阿斯兰，”彼得国王致意，单膝跪下，扶起狮王沉重的前爪至脸庞，“我很高兴。又很抱歉。在我们的行程开始我就领错了路，尤其是昨天早晨。”

“我亲爱的孩子。”阿斯兰说。

然后他转身欢迎埃德蒙，说了声：“干得好。”

接着，一阵令人紧张的停顿后，一个深沉的声音说道：“苏珊。”苏珊没回答，不过其他人感觉她在哭泣。“你内心听从了恐惧，孩子，”阿斯兰说，“来，我给你吹口气。忘掉恐惧。你现在变勇敢了吗？”

“好一点儿了，阿斯兰。”苏珊说。

“好了！”阿斯兰高声说，声音里带着点儿轻吼，尾巴扫了扫身体的两侧，“现在，那个矮人在哪儿，那个著名的剑客、弓箭手、不相信狮子的矮人？到这里来，大地之子，出来！”那最后的单词已经不是轻吼，而几乎是咆哮了。

“糟糕！(2)”特鲁普金怕得倒吸一口气，话不成声。孩子们并不担心，他们了解阿斯兰，看得出来他很喜欢矮人；特鲁普金却是另一番情形，他从未见过狮子，更别提狮王了。他做了那唯一明智的选择，那就是，没有逃走，而是踉跄着走向阿斯兰。

阿斯兰猛扑了上去。你见过母猫嘴里叼着小猫咪吗？眼下的情形就是这样。矮人身体蜷缩成一个惨兮兮的小球，挂在阿斯兰嘴边。阿斯兰把他晃动一下，他身上的盔甲就哗啦啦地响起来，像补锅匠的工具袋发出的声响。紧接着，矮人猛地飞到空中。他其实跟躺在床上一样，是安全无虞的，尽管他不这样想。当他跌落时，犹如天鹅绒般柔软的巨大爪子接住了他，温柔得像是母亲的怀抱，然后把他放到地上（头朝上）。

“大地之子，让我们成为朋友吧，好吗？”阿斯兰问。

“好……好的。”矮人喘着气说，气还没喘匀。

“好了，”阿斯兰说，“月亮就要落下去了。看你们身后：黎明即将来临。我们得抓紧时间。你们三人，亚当之子和大地之子，赶往山丘，处理那边的情况。”

矮人还说不出话来，男孩们谁也不敢问阿斯兰是否会跟他们去。他们三个拔剑行礼，然后转身，在盔甲的叮当声中走入幽暗里。露西注意到他们脸上没有倦色：至尊王和埃德蒙王看起来更像是男子汉而不是小男孩。

女孩们离阿斯兰很近，目送他们离开。光线开始起了变化。阿拉维尔，纳尼亚的启明星，低垂在东方的天际，闪耀着，像一轮小月亮。阿斯兰，看起来比以往更高大，仰着头，甩了甩鬃毛，放声大吼。

那吼声，深沉而振聋发聩，开始时像把风琴，以低音起奏，升调，音量加大，然后再度加大，直至大地和空气都颤动起来。吼声由那座山上传出，响彻整个纳尼亚。下方米亚兹的阵营里，人们惊醒了，脸色苍白，面面相觑，抓起他们的武器。阵营再下方的大河里，眼下正是最寒冷的时候，水仙女的头和肩膀，河神胡子丛生的大脑袋，纷纷浮出水面。更远处，在每一片田野和树林里，兔子警觉的耳朵探出洞口，鸟儿睡意浓浓的脑袋从翅膀下探了出来，猫头鹰呜呜地叫起来，狐狸发出叫声，刺猬哼哼地叫着，树叶哗啦啦响着。在城镇和村庄里，母亲们紧紧地把婴儿搂抱在怀里，慌乱的眼睛张望着，狗儿们呜咽着，男人们从床上跳起来，摸索着点灯。在遥远的北部边境，山里的巨人们从他们城堡幽暗的大门处向外查看。

露西和苏珊看见黑乎乎的一团从山的四周朝她们涌来。起初看似漂移在地面上的黑雾，等它接近时，又似黑色海洋那汹涌的波涛，一浪高过一浪，后来终于看明白那到底是什么了——原来是树林在移动。似乎这世界所有的树木都正朝阿斯兰拥来。他们越走近，看起来就越不像树木，当他们都来到露西周围，向阿斯兰弯腰鞠躬，屈膝行礼，挥动着细长的胳膊时，她发现他们都有着人形。苍白的桦树少女正甩着头，柳树妇人拂开沉思的脸庞上的头发注视着阿斯兰，女王般的山毛榉树静立着敬慕地望着阿斯兰，粗野的橡树男子，清瘦忧郁的榆树，头发蓬乱的冬青树（虽然自身黝黑，但他们的妻子却色彩鲜艳、果实累累），还有快乐的花楸树，他们都鞠躬致意，然后直起身子，大喊着：“阿斯兰，阿斯兰！”各种声音交杂，有沙哑的，有嘎吱作响的，也有海浪般的。

阿斯兰周围的人越来越密，舞蹈旋律越来越快速，露西目不暇接，迷糊起来。她弄不清某些人是从哪儿冒出来的，这些人很快就在树间舞来舞去。其中有一个年轻人，身上仅披着块鹿皮，他拳曲的头发上戴着葡萄藤叶织成的花环。要不是那一脸极其狂野的神情，就男孩来说，他的脸蛋就太漂亮了。正如埃德蒙几天后见到他时的评价，感觉“这家伙绝对是什么事都干得出来”。他的名字似乎很多——波洛米奥斯、巴萨勒斯、拉姆，这还仅是其中三个。他身边有很多女郎，跟他一样狂野。出人意料地，甚至还有骑在毛驴上的人。每个人都在欢笑，每个人都叫嚷着：“尤安，尤安，尤——安。”

“这是在玩耍吗，阿斯兰？”那年轻人喊道。很显然，是的。可几乎每个人对要玩什么游戏都各有不同看法。他们玩的可能是捉人游戏，可露西没看出来谁是那个抓人者。这更像是玩捉迷藏，只是每个人的表现都像是他们的眼睛被蒙上了。这也类似找拖鞋游戏，可拖鞋总也没找着。当骑在毛驴上那个胖极了的老男人开始高喊：“点心！吃点心时间到了。”场面变得更为混乱。那人从毛驴上摔下来，又被其他人给扔上驴子，而那头毛驴以为这是场马戏表演，卖力地展示后腿走路。同时，出现了越来越多的葡萄藤叶。很快，不光出现了葡萄叶子，还出现了葡萄藤。藤蔓缠绕上一切，缠上树人的大腿，缠绕他们的脖颈。露西举手将头发往后捋，却发现她捋的是葡萄枝。毛驴被藤缠住了，尾巴完全被藤缠绕，某些暗色的东西低垂在两耳间。露西又看了一眼，发现那是一串葡萄。接着出现的大多是葡萄，在头上，在脚下，到处都是。

“点心！点心！”老人高喊着。大家开始吃起来，不管你有什么样的温室，也从没尝过这样的葡萄。真正的好葡萄，外表结实紧致，吃进嘴里满口清甜，这样的葡萄是女孩们从前无法饱尝的。在这里，葡萄多得吃不完，而且无须讲究餐桌礼仪。随处可见黏糊糊、染上葡萄汁颜色的手指，虽然嘴巴塞满了，可欢笑声从未间断，人们不停地以约德尔调子叫喊，尤安，尤安，尤——安，直至突然间大家同时觉得游戏（无论何种游戏）和盛宴该结束了。大家猛然坐在地上，屏息静气，面对着阿斯兰，听听他接下来要讲的话。

这时朝阳正在爬升，露西记起了什么，低声对苏珊说：

“喂，苏，我知道他们是谁了。”

“谁？”

“那一脸狂野的年轻人是酒神巴克斯，那个骑在毛驴上的老人是森林之神西勒诺斯。你忘了很久以前塔努斯先生跟我们讲过他们？”

“当然记得。不过我说，露——”

“什么？”

“如果不是跟着阿斯兰一起，跟巴克斯和他那些狂野女郎待在一起，我会觉得没有安全感。”

“我不这么认为。”露西说。

第十二章　巫术和突然报复


这时，特鲁普金和两个男孩抵达了通向山丘内部那又小又暗的石头拱门，两个獾哨兵（埃德蒙只看得见他们脸上的白斑）跳了出来，龇牙低吼：“谁在那里？”

“特鲁普金，”矮人回答，“我带来了远古纳尼亚的至尊王。”

獾们嗅了嗅男孩们的手。“终于来了，”他们说，“总算来了。”

“给我们一支火把，朋友们。”特鲁普金说。

獾从拱门里寻出一支火把，彼得点燃后递给特鲁普金。“最好由D．L．F.领路，”他说，“我们不知这里如何走。”

特鲁普金拿过火把，引路进入黑暗的地道。地道寒冷、幽暗，散发着霉味，时不时有蝙蝠从火把光亮处飞过，蛛网密布。自火车站的那天早晨起，男孩们大多时候待在户外，此时感觉像是落入了陷阱，又或是进入了地牢。

“喂，彼得，”埃德蒙低声道，“看墙上那些石刻。看起来不古老吗？可我们比它还要老。我们最后来这里的时候，这些石刻还没出现呢。”

“是啊，”彼得说，“这让人感慨。”

矮人继续前行，先右拐，再左拐，又下了几级台阶，然后再次左拐。终于，他们看到前头有光——门下透出的光。他们初次在地道里听到说话声，原来他们来到了指挥中心的门边。里头的声音充满怒气。有人正大声讲话，以至于没人察觉到男孩们和矮人走近。

“不喜欢这说话的口气，”矮人低声对彼得说，“让我们先听听他们说什么。”于是他们仨悄无声息地站在门外。

“你很清楚，”一个声音说道（“那是国王。”特鲁普金低语），“我为什么没有在今天日出时吹响那个号角。你忘了吗？特鲁普金刚走，米亚兹就进攻我们，我们拼死抵抗了三个多钟头。一有喘息时机，我就吹响了号角。”

“我怎么可能忘记，”愤怒的声音传来，“我的矮人部下们抗击着敌人主力，五分之一的人都阵亡了。”（“那是尼克布里克。”特鲁普金低声道。）

“不知羞耻，矮人，”一个粗嗓门道（“特鲁弗亨特的声音。”特鲁普金说），“我们跟矮人们一样拼命，不过没人比得上国王。”

“你怎么说都行，我管不着，”尼克布里克回答，“可要么是号角吹得太晚，要么就是号角没有魔力，反正没见到任何援助。你，你这伟大的教士、优秀的魔法师，你这无所不知的家伙，还要我们寄希望于阿斯兰，彼得王，那其他所有一切吗？”

“我得承认……我无法否认……我对事情的结果深感失望。”回应声传来。（“那是科涅利尔斯博士。”特鲁普金说。）

“实话实说，”尼克布里克，“你黔驴技穷，鸡飞蛋打，毫无收获，承诺落空。靠边站着，让别人干活。这就是为什么……”

“援助会来的，”特鲁弗亨特说，“我支持阿斯兰。要耐心，学学我们野兽。援助会来的。没准现在就在门外。”

“呸！”尼克布里克咆哮，“你们獾类要我们等到天塌后再去捉云雀吗？我跟你说，我们等不了。食物越来越少，每一次战斗我们都损失惨重，我们的跟随者正在减少。”

“原因是什么？”特鲁弗亨特问，“我可以告诉你原因。那是因为他们都在传言，我们召唤了古代的国王们，可他们没有回应。特鲁普金出发前最后说过（他很可能已经死了）：‘要是一定要吹响号角，那么千万不要让士兵们知道为什么吹号角，又寄予了什么希望。’可当天傍晚人人都知道了。”

“你暗示我是那个泄密者，獾，你最好把你的黑嘴塞进马蜂窝里，”尼克布里克说，“把话收回去，否则……”

“噢，别吵了，你们俩，”凯斯宾国王说，“我想知道尼克布里克的打算，他一直在暗示我们要怎么做。可在这之前，我想知道这两个陌生人是谁，他把他们带进了我们指挥部，他们站在那里闭着嘴竖着耳朵听。”

“他们是我的朋友，”尼克布里克说，“你不过是特鲁普金和獾的朋友，难道你比他们更有资格待在这里？要不是你的朋友，那个穿着黑袍的老糊涂又有什么资格在这里？就唯独我不能把自己的朋友带进来？”

“陛下是你宣誓效忠的国王。”特鲁弗亨特严厉地批评。

“宫廷礼仪，宫廷礼仪，”尼克布里克冷笑，“在这个洞里，我们就直说吧。你清楚……他也清楚……除非我们把他从目前的困境中解救出来，这个台尔马男孩一周内就会成为一个无地无民可统治的空头国王。”

“也许，”科涅利尔斯说，“你的新朋友愿意自己说话？你们俩，是谁，干什么的？”

“尊敬的博士大师，”一个尖细哀怨的声音响起，“如你所愿，我不过是一个可怜的老妇，仅此而已，我很感激这位可敬的矮人阁下对我的友善，的确如此。陛下，愿主保佑你英俊的脸庞，你无须顾虑我这样的老妇，风湿病把我折磨得弯腰驼背，得靠拐杖才能支撑身体。我有些微末的小技能——当然，无法跟你相比，博士大师——能施点儿魔法，念点儿咒语，要是在座的不反对，我很高兴能用于对抗敌军。因为我恨他们。哦，是的。没人比我更恨。”

“这真有趣，而且，呃，令人满意，”科涅利尔斯博士说，“女士，我想我知道你是干什么的了。尼克布里克，也许你另一个朋友愿意自我介绍一下？”

一个呆板阴森的声音回应，这声音让彼得起鸡皮疙瘩：“我是饥饿，我是焦渴。一旦给我咬上，我就会死不松口，就算我死了，也只能把我咬的那口从敌人身上割下来，咬掉的那口也只能与我同葬。我一百年不吃不喝也不会死。在冰面上睡上一百个夜晚我也不会冻僵。饮下一条河流的鲜血我的肚子也不会胀破。告诉我，你们的敌人在哪里？”

“你希望在这两人面前公开你的计划吗？”凯斯宾问。

“是的，”尼克布里克说，“我打算靠他们的帮助来实施我的计策。”

特鲁普金和男孩们听到凯斯宾和他的两个朋友低声商量了一两分钟，可听不清他们在说什么。然后，凯斯宾大声说：

“好吧，尼克布里克，”他说，“讲讲你的计划。”

接下来是一阵长久的停顿，男孩们开始怀疑尼克布里克是否还打算开口；当他开口时，声音低了下来，似乎他自己也不怎么喜欢他要说的事。

“该说的都说了，该做的都做了，”他咕哝地抱怨，“我们谁也不知道纳尼亚古代的真相如何。特鲁普金不信那些传说。我原想试试真假。我们先试了那个号角，但没有效果。假如以前真有过某个至尊王彼得、苏珊女王、埃德蒙国王，还有露西女王，那要么是他们没听见，要么他们来不了，要么他们是我们的敌人……”

“要么他们在来的路上。”特鲁弗亨特插嘴。

“你可以继续这么说，直至米亚兹把我们都喂给他的狗。我要讲的是，我们已经试验了古老传说这个链条中的一环，结果没有给我们带来任何益处。那么，剑断了，可以用匕首。除了古代的国王和女王，传说还讲述了其他力量。要是我们把那些力量唤醒，那会如何？”

“如果你是指阿斯兰的话，”特鲁弗亨特说，“召唤他和召唤国王们是一回事。他们是他的仆人。如果他不愿派他们来（不过我坚信他会的），很可能他自己亲自来。”

“我不是指阿斯兰。有一点你说对了，”尼克布里克说，“阿斯兰和国王们是一伙的。要么阿斯兰死了，要么他是我们的敌人，要么某些比他强大的势力阻挠了他的到来。就算他来了，我们能肯定他会是我们的朋友吗？就传言来看，他对矮人们并不总是友好的。也并非对所有的野兽都友好。问问狼就知道了。而且，据我所知，他只来过纳尼亚一次，很快就离开了。阿斯兰不在考虑范围之内。我想到的是另一个人。”

没人回应，他们沉默了几分钟，静得埃德蒙能听见獾那呼哧的鼻息声。

“你指谁？”凯斯宾终于问道。

“我指的是比阿斯兰更强大的力量，那个力量用咒语把纳尼亚镇住了很多很多年，假如那些传说是真的话。”

“白女巫！”三个声音同时响起，彼得从响动中推测有三个人跳了起来。

“是的，”尼克布里克缓慢、清楚地说道，“我指的就是白女巫。坐下。别跟小孩似的，听到个名字就给吓成这样。我们需要力量：而这个力量会支持我们。讲到力量，传说不是说吗，白女巫打败了阿斯兰，把他绑了，要在那边的那块石头上杀掉他，就是灯那边的石头？”

“可传说又说，他复活了。”獾严厉地说。

“没错，传说而已，”尼克布里克回应，“你会注意到，我们极少听到他之后的事迹。他从传说中淡出了。假如他真的复活了的话，你如何解释这个呢？更可能的是，他没有复活，传说不再谈及他，那是因为无话可谈，这种可能性不是更大吗？”

“他后来确立了国王们和女王们。”凯斯宾说。

“赢下辉煌战役的国王通常能确立自己的地位，无须一头耍把戏的狮子的帮助。”尼克布里克说。里面传出一声愤怒的低吼，可能是特鲁弗亨特发出的。

“再说，”尼克布里克继续道，“那些国王和他们的统治后来怎样了？他们也淡出了。而白女巫的情形则不同。传说她统治了一百年，一百年的寒冬。换句话说，那是本事。有切切实实的效果。”

“可是，天地为证！”国王说，“我们不是一直都听说她是最可怕的敌人？她不是一个比米亚兹还要坏上十倍的暴君吗？”

“也许吧，”尼克布里克语气冰冷，“也许她没有善待你们人类，要是那时有你们人类的话。也许对一些动物来说她也很坏。我相信，她灭掉了河狸；至少现在在纳尼亚见不到任何河狸。可她跟我们矮人处得还行。我是一个矮人，我捍卫我的族群利益。我们不怕白女巫。”

“可你已经加入我们了。”特鲁弗亨特说。

“没错，我的族人迄今因此获益良多，”尼克布里克恶声恶气地说，“所有危险的突击任务都派给谁？矮人。配给不足时，减少谁的口粮？矮人。谁……”

“谎言！彻头彻尾的谎言！”獾说。

“因此，”尼克布里克提高嗓门，几乎尖声叫喊起来，“要是你们无法帮助我的族人，我就向能帮我们的人求助。”

“你要公然谋反吗，小矮人？”国王问。

“把那剑收回剑鞘，凯斯宾，”尼克布里克说，“开会时搞谋杀，嗯？这就是你的把戏？别蠢得去尝试。你以为我怕你？你那头有三个，我这边也有三个。”

“那么，上吧。”特鲁弗亨特咆哮，可他立刻被打断了。

“停，停，停，”科涅利尔斯博士说，“你动手太快了。白女巫已经死了。所有的传说都支持这点。那么尼克布里克说要召唤白女巫是什么意思？”

刚才讲过话的那个可怕阴森的声音道：“哦，她真死了吗？”

接着那个刺耳哀怨的声音说道：“唉，保佑他的心脏，亲爱的小陛下别担心白夫人死掉了……我们都这么称呼她。可敬的博士大师这么说，只是取笑我这个可怜的老妇罢了。亲切的博士大师，博学的博士大师，谁听说过有哪个女巫真的会死掉？总能让她们复活。”

“把她召唤出来，”阴森的声音道，“我们都准备好了。画个圆圈。点上蓝色火焰。”

国王凯斯宾的雷霆话语盖过了獾越来越响的怒吼以及科涅利尔斯严厉的斥责声：“什么？”

“这就是你的计策，尼克布里克！黑色巫术，召唤一个受诅咒的魂灵。我明白你的同伴是谁了——一个巫婆和一个狼人！”

接下来一片混乱，持续了一分钟左右。里面传来野兽的嘶吼，刀剑打斗声，男孩们和特鲁普金冲了进去。彼得瞥见一头可怕、阴森、瘦削的生物，半人半狼，正作势扑向一个跟自己年纪差不多的男孩，埃德蒙见到一只獾和一个矮人在地板上滚作一团厮打着，特鲁普金发觉自己跟那巫婆打了一个照面。她的鼻子和下巴外突，像一把胡桃夹子，她那肮脏的花白头发披散在脸上，她正掐着科涅利尔斯的咽喉。特鲁普金一剑劈下，她的头滚落在地板上。灯给撞翻了，黑暗中只听到剑击声、撕咬声、抓挠声、挥拳声、脚踢声，响声持续了约六十秒钟。接着安静了下来。

“你没事吧，埃德？”

“我……我想还好，”埃德蒙喘息着说，“我制服了那畜生尼克布里克，不过他还活着。”

“沉死了！(1)”传来愤怒的叫喊，“你压着的是我！走开！你简直是头小象！”

“对不起，D．L．F.，”埃德蒙说，“好受些了吗？”

“哎哟！不好受！”特鲁普金怒吼，“你把靴子伸进我嘴里了！走开！”

“凯斯宾国王在哪儿？”彼得问。

“我在这儿，”一个很虚弱的声音回应，“我被咬了。”

某人划火柴的声音响起。那是埃德蒙。小火苗映出他的脸，苍白肮脏。他跌跌撞撞地摸索了一阵，找到一根蜡烛（他们不再使用油灯，因为油都耗尽了），把蜡烛立在桌上，点燃了它。当火苗稳定时，几个人爬了起来。烛光下六个人眨着眼互相打量。

“对手好像都被我们干掉了，”彼得说，“那是巫婆，死了。”（他很快看了她一眼，转开了视线。）“尼克布里克，也死了。我猜这家伙是狼人吧。距离上次见到这东西，已经很久了。狼头，人身。这意味着，在他被杀死的那一刻，他正由人变成狼。那么，我猜，你是凯斯宾国王吧？”

“是的，”那个男孩说，“可我不知道你是谁。”

“这是至尊王，彼得国王。”特鲁普金说。

“欢迎陛下。”凯斯宾说。

“也欢迎陛下你，”彼得说，“我来不是要取代你的位置，你知道，而是要稳固你的位置。”

“陛下。”彼得身边一个声音响起。他转过来，正好与獾面对面。彼得身体前倾，环抱住这头野兽，亲吻他毛茸茸的脑袋：他这么做并不显得女孩子气，因为他是至尊王。

“最勇敢的獾，”他说，“你从未怀疑过我们。”

“过奖了，陛下，”特鲁弗亨特说，“我是动物，动物不会变心。更何况，我是獾，我们獾坚定不移。”

“我为尼克布里克感到难过，”凯斯宾说，“虽然从一见面起，他就讨厌我。长期的苦难和仇恨使他的内心变坏了。如果我们能快速地取得胜利，在和平年代里他会成为一个善良的矮人。我不清楚我们当中谁杀死了他。我还是为此高兴。”

“你在流血。”彼得说。

“哦，我被咬了，”凯斯宾说，“是那个——那狼样的家伙咬的。”清洗和包扎伤口花了不少时间，弄好后，特鲁普金说：“好啦。我们先吃早餐，再处理其他事情。”

“可别在这儿吃。”彼得说。

“好的，”凯斯宾颤抖了一下说道，“我们得让人把这些尸体弄走。”

“把这些害虫扔进坑里，”彼得说，“那个矮人就交给他的族人，按他们的方式埋葬他。”

他们终于在阿斯兰堡垒的另一间幽暗的地下室里吃上了早餐。要在平时，他们可不会挑这么一顿早餐，凯斯宾和科涅利尔斯想吃鹿肉馅饼，彼得和埃德蒙想要黄油煎蛋和热咖啡，可每个人面前仅有一小块冷熊肉（从男孩们口袋里拿出来的）、一块硬奶酪、一个洋葱，还有一杯水。可从他们那狼吞虎咽的劲儿来看，别人会以为那有多美味。

第十三章　至尊王指挥


“眼下，”他们吃完早餐后，彼得说，“阿斯兰和女孩们（凯斯宾，我说的是苏珊女王和露西女王）就在附近。我们不知他何时行动。无疑，时机由他掌握，而不是我们。在这期间，他希望我们做些力所能及的事。凯斯宾，你讲过，我们的实力不足以跟米亚兹的军队激战。”

“恐怕不行，至尊王。”凯斯宾说。他很喜欢彼得，可感觉自己心拙口笨。与古老传说中的伟大君王面对面，双方都觉得新奇，凯斯宾的新奇感要比对方的感受来得更强烈。

“好吧，那么，”彼得说，“我会给他发一封挑战书，来场单挑。”这提议以前没人想到。

“听我说，”凯斯宾说，“不能让我来挑战吗？我想为父报仇。”

“你受了伤，”彼得说，“再说，他恐怕会嘲笑你发出的挑战吧？我是说，我们了解你既是一位国王，又是一名勇士，可他把你看作一个小孩子。”

“可是，陛下，”獾说，他坐得离彼得很近，一直注视着他，“他会接受哪怕是来自你的挑战吗？他清楚他军队的实力更强。”

“很可能他不会接受，”彼得说，“不过，还是有这个可能。就算他不接受，我们来回互派使者等事宜会占用大半天时间。到那时，阿斯兰可能已有所作为。而且至少我可以在这期间视察军队，加强工事。我打算发出挑战书。我现在就写。有笔墨吗，博士大师？”

“学者笔墨不离身，陛下。”科涅利尔斯回答。

“很好，我来口述。”彼得说。博士铺开一张羊皮纸，打开墨水盒，削尖笔头，彼得趁这当口仰靠着，半闭着眼，回忆他当年写此类文书的措辞，那是很久以前，在纳尼亚的黄金时代。

“好了，”他终于开口，“现在，可以开始了吗，博士？”

科涅利尔斯博士将笔蘸了蘸墨水，等他口述。彼得口述如下：

“彼得，由阿斯兰授予，通过民选，经由法令批准，凭借战功，被封为纳尼亚所有国王的至尊王，孤独岛的皇帝，凯尔帕拉维尔的君主，至尊狮王军团骑士，向米亚兹，凯斯宾八世之子，前纳尼亚护国公，现自封为纳尼亚国王，致意。写下来了吗？”

“纳尼亚国王，逗号，致意。”博士喃喃自语，“写好了，陛下。”

“然后另起一段，”彼得说，“为避免血流成河，为避免我们的王国纳尼亚遭受战争的摧残，我乐于代表深受热爱和信赖的凯斯宾，向阁下挑战，决斗断讼，证明上述凯斯宾为纳尼亚的合法国王，其王权由我们授予，由台尔马法律赋予。阁下犯下双重背叛大罪，其一，篡夺上述凯斯宾对纳尼亚的统治权，其二，犯下可怕的恶行（别忘了这里要强调一下，博士），残忍、违背人伦，谋杀善良的国王，你自己的兄弟，凯斯宾九世。因此，我们强烈地向阁下提出上述挑战，一对一决斗。挑战书由我深受爱戴的御弟埃德蒙递交，他是前纳尼亚之王，蓝登荒原公爵，西征伯爵，石桌军团骑士，他全权负责商定与阁下决斗的所有细节。决斗定于凯斯宾十世元年本月绿顶月十二日，在阿斯兰堡垒驻地开战。”

“应该可以了，”彼得深吸了一口气，“我们另派两人跟埃德蒙同往。我觉得那巨人应该算一个。”

“你要知道，他……他不怎么机灵。”凯斯宾说。

“当然不机灵，”彼得说，“只要不吭声，巨人的外表还是引人注目的。派他去能让他振奋起来。另一个派谁去好？”

“照我看，”特鲁普金说，“要是想找个光凭气势就能把人镇住的，里皮契普是最好的人选。”

“他确实是，就我所闻，”彼得笑着说，“要是他不是个小个子就好了。敌人要靠近才能看到他！”

“派格兰斯托姆，陛下，”特鲁弗亨特说，“没人会嘲笑马人。”




一小时后，米亚兹军队里的两个首领，格罗赛尔勋爵和索斯皮安勋爵在早饭后，正沿着他们的阵线散步，剔着牙，他们抬头见到马人和巨人威伯维德正从树林里向他们走来，这两人他们在战场上见过，中间的那个人他们不认识。埃德蒙学校的男同学要是见到此刻的他也会认不出来。因为在见面时，阿斯兰给他吹了口气，他周身都洋溢着英雄气概。

“他们要干什么？”格罗赛尔勋爵说，“攻击？”

“相反，是和谈，”索斯皮安说，“瞧，他们拿着绿枝。他们很可能是来投降的。”

“走在马人和巨人中间的那人没有投降的神色，”格罗赛尔说，“他会是谁？不是凯斯宾那男孩。”

“确实不是，”索斯皮安说，“无论那帮叛民从哪儿把他找来，他都是一个厉害的勇士，我跟你保证。他比（私下跟你说吧）米亚兹更有王者气概。他穿的盔甲多神气！我们的工匠打造不出这样的。”

“我赌上我那匹斑点马波利，他带来的是挑战书，而不是投降书。”格罗赛尔说。

“怎么会呢？”索斯皮安说，“敌军已经被控制在我们手里了。米亚兹不会蠢到放弃他的战场优势。”

“可以哄他上当。”格罗赛尔压低了嗓音说。

“小声，”索斯皮安说，“离这里远点儿，别让那些哨兵听见。这下好啦。我没误会阁下刚才的意思吧？”

“要是国王应承下这场决斗断讼，”格罗赛尔低声说，“那么，其结果不是他杀死对手，就是被杀。”

“没错。”索斯皮安点头说。

“要是他杀死对方，这场仗我们就打赢了。”

“确实如此。那要不是那样呢？”

“哟，如果不是，没有国王我们一样能打赢这场仗。无须告知阁下，米亚兹不是什么明主。他死后，我们既赢得了胜利，还没了国王的管治。”

“大人，你意思是，没有国王，你我照样能轻易地控制这个王国？”

格罗赛尔面目狰狞起来。“别忘了，”他说，“是我们把他放上宝座的。这么多年来，他享受王权，我们得到了什么好处？他有对我们表示感激吗？”

“别再说了，”索斯皮安答道，“瞧，来人了，召我们去国王的营帐。”

他们来到米亚兹的帐篷，见到埃德蒙和他的两个同伴坐在帐外，享用着招待他们的蛋糕和葡萄酒，他们刚递交了战书，退出帐外等国王考虑。如此近距离地打量，这两个台尔马首领觉得这三人让人心惊。

营帐里，他们见到米亚兹，没有佩带武器，正吃着早餐。他气红了脸，皱着眉头。

“瞧！”他吼着，从桌子另一头朝他们扔过来那张羊皮纸，“瞧我那傲慢的侄子给我们带来了一堆多幼稚的故事。”

“请恕罪，陛下，”格罗赛尔说，“假如我们刚在外面见到的那个年轻勇士就是信上提到的埃德蒙王，我不会觉得他是一个童话故事，而是把他当作一个危险的骑士。”

“埃德蒙王，呸！”米亚兹说，“阁下相信那些有关彼得、埃德蒙，以及诸如此类的无稽之谈？”

“我相信自己的眼睛，陛下。”格罗赛尔说。

“唉，这么做毫无意义，”米亚兹说，“但就战书而论，我想我们的意见是一致的吧？”

“我想是的，确实如此，陛下。”格罗赛尔说。

“说说你的看法。”国王问。

“绝对要拒绝，”格罗赛尔说，“虽说没人称我为懦夫，但我得直率地说，跟那年轻人对战，我没这个胆量。要是他的兄弟，那个至尊王，比他还危险（这是可能的），那么，为了自家性命，陛下，别去招惹他。”

“真该死！”米亚兹喊道，“我要的不是这种建议。你以为，我是在问敢不敢碰这个彼得吗（要是真有此人的话）？你以为我怕他？我要听的是你对此事有何计策；在有优势的情况下，我们是否该冒险，来一场决斗断讼？”

“对此我只能回答，陛下，”格罗赛尔说，“无论何种缘由，必须拒绝这个挑战。那个陌生骑士的脸上有杀气。”

“你又来了！”米亚兹怒气冲冲地说，“你想让人以为我跟你一样怯懦？”

“陛下怎么说都行。”格罗赛尔闷闷不乐地说。

“你跟老妇一般见识，格罗赛尔，”国王说，“你怎么看，索斯皮安？”

“不予理会，陛下，”他回答，“陛下提到的关于此事的计策就在于此。这使得陛下有充分的理由拒绝，又不会引起对陛下荣誉与勇气的质疑。”

“天啊！”米亚兹惊呼着一跃而起，“你今天也着魔了？你以为我在找拒绝的理由？你还不如当面骂我懦夫。”

对话的发展正中他们下怀，所以他们一声不吭。

“我看出来了，”米亚兹说，狠盯着他们俩，眼睛似乎都要瞪出来了，“你们自己跟兔子一样胆小，还厚颜无耻地以为我跟你们一样胆怯！找拒绝的理由，好哇！找借口不战！你们还是战士吗？你们还是台尔马人吗？你们是男人吗？要是我真拒绝了（以君主的职责和军事策略等各种充分理由拒绝），你们就会以为，也诱导别人以为，我惧惮了。不是这样吗？”

“像陛下这样的年纪，”格罗赛尔说，“拒绝跟一个正值壮年的伟大勇士决斗，任何明智的士兵都不会把这样的人称为懦夫。”

“这么说，我不但是个胆小鬼，还是一个行将就木的老糊涂，”米亚兹咆哮道，“我告诉你们我的决定，我的大臣们。你们这些女人见识（不敢面对问题，玩手段），恰恰让你们的目的落了空。我本打算拒绝的。但我要接受挑战。听到了吗，接受！我不会因为你们中邪或者意图不轨，而变得胆怯，让自己蒙羞。”

“我们恳求陛下……”格罗赛尔还没说完，米亚兹就冲出了营帐，接着他们听见他对埃德蒙大嚷着表示接受挑战。

这两位大臣互视对方，低声轻笑。

“我就知道，只要适当地激怒他，他会接受的，”格罗赛尔说，“不过，我不会忘记他把我叫作胆小鬼。我要报复。”

消息传回，大家听了传达，这下阿斯兰堡垒骚动起来。埃德蒙跟米亚兹的一个上尉画出了决斗场地，又用木桩和绳子围上。两个台尔马人站在其中的两个边角，第三人站在场地一侧的中间，他们都是决斗场的司令官。另外两个边角和另一侧中间位置所需的司令官由至尊王派出。彼得正跟凯斯宾解释，他不能担任其中一员，因为他们决斗的缘由就是为了他的王位继承权，这时突然有一个懒洋洋的粗嗓门：“陛下，打搅一下。”彼得转过身来，面前站着那头最年长的胖熊。“请听我说，陛下，”他说，“我是一头熊，我是。”

“无可否认，你是熊，而且还是一头了不起的熊，我对此毫不怀疑。”彼得说。

“没错，”熊说，“熊要当决斗场的司令官，这是熊的权利。”

“别让他去，”特鲁普金低声对彼得说，“他是个好家伙，但他会让我们大家出丑。他老打瞌睡，还老吮吸熊掌。在敌人面前也这么干。”

“我无法阻止，”彼得说，“因为他说对了。熊有这个特权。我真想不到，过了这么多年，这一点还有人记着，而很多传统已经被遗忘了。”

“求您了，陛下。”熊说。

“这是你的权利，”彼得说，“你将是司令官之一。但切记不要吮手掌。”

“当然不会了。”熊很吃惊地说。

“瞧，你这会儿又吮上了！”特鲁普金怒吼。

熊快速地把熊掌从嘴里拿出，假装没听见。

“陛下！”地面附近传来一个尖厉的嗓音。

“啊——里皮契普！”彼得四下寻找，听到老鼠打招呼人们通常都会这样。

“陛下，”里皮契普说，“我的性命供陛下驱使，但我的荣誉是属于我个人的。陛下，我的队伍中有陛下军队里唯一的号手。我曾以为，没准儿，我们会被派去下战书。陛下，我的士兵很伤心。如果陛下允许的话，让我当司令官，这会让他们满意。”

这时头顶某处传来雷鸣似的响声，巨人威伯维德突然发出傻呵呵的笑声，脾气好些的巨人常会发出这样的笑声。他马上克制住了自己，一脸严肃，这时里皮契普知道了响声来源。

“这恐怕不行，”彼得很严肃地说，“有些人类害怕老鼠……”

“我注意到了，陛下。”里皮契普说。

“而且这对米亚兹不太公平，”彼得继续道，“如果见到某些让他泄气的东西。”

“陛下是真君子，”老鼠说，崇敬地鞠了一躬，“在这件事情上，我们看法一致……我想我刚才听见有人在嘲笑。如果在场的哪个想嘲弄我，我会乐于为他效劳——用我的剑——随时恭候。”

话音落下，又是一阵尴尬的沉默，彼得打破沉默说：“巨人威伯维德、熊和马人格兰斯托姆将作为我们的司令官。决斗在午后两点开始。中午十二点准时吃饭。”

“喂，”大家离开后，埃德蒙说，“我想会顺利的吧。我是说，我想你能打败他吧？”

“这要打了才能知道。”彼得说。





第十四章　大家如此忙碌


将近两点，特鲁普金、獾和其他生物坐在树林边，对面亮晃晃的是米亚兹的军队，两边相隔约两箭距离。两军之间，平坦的草地上用木桩围出一片地，用于决斗。格罗赛尔和索斯皮安分别站远处的两个边角，手握出鞘的剑。近处的边角则站着巨人威伯维德和胖熊，这头熊不顾大家的警告正吮着爪子，那样子看起来，说真的，傻极了。所幸作为弥补，格兰斯托姆站在决斗场右侧，一动不动，除了偶尔在草坪上跺跺后蹄，比左边场地站在他对面的那个台尔马男爵神气多了。彼得刚跟埃德蒙和博士握了手，此时正走向决斗场。此刻就像是重要赛事发令枪响起前的时刻，但气氛要凝重得多。

“我希望阿斯兰会在决斗前出现。”特鲁普金说。

“我也是，”特鲁弗亨特说，“可是看看你身后。”

“老天！(1)”一看之下，矮人喃喃自语，“那些是什么人？高大——美丽——像男神、女神和巨人。成千上万，正从我们后面过来。他们是谁？”

“他们是树精、树神和森林之神，”特鲁弗亨特说，“阿斯兰把他们唤醒了。”

“哼！”矮人说，“要是敌军不守承诺，这对付他们会很管用。可要是米亚兹剑术技高一筹的话，这对至尊王帮助不大。”

獾没出声，因为这时彼得和米亚兹各从一端走进决斗场，两人都没骑马，身穿盔甲，戴着头盔，手持盾牌。他们走到一起，鞠躬致意，好像说了什么，可无法听见。下一刻两人亮剑，剑在阳光下闪闪发亮。一时间两剑撞击声响起，双方军队开始呐喊，就像观看足球比赛的观众那样，将剑击声淹没。

“打得好，彼得，噢，打得好！”埃德蒙见米亚兹踉跄着退后了一步半不由得大喊起来。“继续进攻，快！”彼得攻了上去，有那么一刻，看似就要打赢了。可这时米亚兹镇定下来，开始利用自己身高体重的优势。“米亚兹！米亚兹！国王！国王加油！”台尔马人吼声震天。凯斯宾和埃德蒙脸色发白，紧张极了。

“彼得受了几下猛击。”埃德蒙说。

“喂！”凯斯宾说，“发生什么了？”

“两人分开了，”埃德蒙说，“都有些喘不上气，我猜。瞧。啊，他们现在又开始了，这次更谨慎了。两人转着圈，试探对方的防守。”

“看来这个米亚兹是在行的。”博士自语。他话音刚落，老纳尼亚人这方发出震耳欲聋的鼓掌声、叫喊声，还有扔帽子声。

“怎么了？怎么了？”博士问，“我老眼昏花没看着。”

“至尊王刺中了米亚兹的腋下，”凯斯宾说不停地鼓掌，“正好从锁子甲袖孔刺了进去。最先见血。”

“可形势看起来又不妙了，”埃德蒙说，“彼得盾牌用得别扭。他左臂肯定受伤了。”

真是被埃德蒙说中了。大家都发现彼得的盾牌是无力地挂在手臂上的。台尔马人的呐喊声更大了。

“你战斗经验比我丰富，”凯斯宾说，“现在还有机会赢吗？”

“可能性很小，”埃德蒙说，“我想他还是有机会做到的，这得靠运气。”

“啊，我们为什么要这样做呢？”凯斯宾说。

突然，双方的呐喊声减弱。埃德蒙纳闷了一会儿，然后说道：“哦，我明白了。他们同意休息片刻。来吧，博士。我们也许能为至尊王做点儿什么。”他们跑到决斗场，彼得也出了绳圈跟他们相会，他脸发红，满头大汗，胸膛起伏着。

“你左臂受伤了？”埃德蒙问。

“确切说算不得伤，”彼得说，“他把全部臂力都压在我的盾牌上——跟一大堆砖头似的——盾牌把手边缘勒进了手腕。我想手腕没断，但可能扭伤了。如果你帮我把手腕缠紧点儿，我想我还能应付。”

他们帮他弄着，埃德蒙担忧地问：“他怎么样，彼得？”

“难对付，”彼得说，“非常难对付。如果我逼得他不停地跳来跳去，直到他的体重和气力不足，成为他的劣势，加上在这样的大太阳底下，我还是有机会的。老实说，除此之外，我机会不大。要是他杀了我的话，埃德，代我向家里所有人问好。他重新上场了。再见，老弟。再见，博士。喂，埃德，代我特别问候特鲁普金。他是个大好人。”

埃德蒙说不出话来。他跟博士走回自己的阵营，心里很难受。

但新一轮决斗进展顺利。彼得现在似乎盾牌用得顺手了一些，而且步法灵活。他现在几乎是在跟米亚兹玩起了你追我逃的捉人游戏，不让他近身，不断移动，调动对手满场转。

“胆小鬼！”台尔马人嘘声四起，“你怎么不敢面对他？怕了吗，嗯？还以为你是来决斗，不是来跳舞的。羞呀！”

“噢，真希望他不会受他们影响。”凯斯宾说。

“他不会的，”埃德蒙说，“你不了解他——哎哟！”米亚兹终于得手，砍在彼得的头盔上。彼得摇晃了一下，侧滑，单膝跪地。台尔马人的叫嚣声如海潮般震耳。“机会，米亚兹，”他们叫嚷着，“机会。快！快！杀了他。”不过，确实，这个篡位者无须怂恿。他已经压住了彼得。当宝剑挥向彼得，埃德蒙紧张得把嘴唇都咬出了血。眼看他的头就要被砍下。谢天谢地！剑从他右肩划过。矮人打造的锁子甲很结实，没裂开。

“天啊！”埃德蒙叫喊，“他又站起来了。彼得，上，彼得！”

“我看不清怎么回事，”博士说，“他是怎么做到的？”

“趁对方挥下手臂时，他抓住了米亚兹的胳膊，”特鲁普金高兴得手舞足蹈，“真是个男子汉！把对手的胳膊当梯子。至尊王！至尊王万岁！起来吧，老纳尼亚！”

“瞧，”特鲁弗亨特说，“米亚兹恼怒了。这是好事。”

他们现在全力以赴：一阵你来我往的攻击，每一招都很致命。随着战斗越来越激烈，呐喊声几乎消失。观战者们屏住了呼吸。场面极其惨烈又极其壮丽。

老纳尼亚人大声欢呼。原来米亚兹倒地了——不是被彼得打趴下的，而是给草丛绊倒了。彼得退后，等他爬起来。

“噢，哥哥，哥哥，哥哥，”埃德蒙自语，“有必要这么绅士吗？不过，我想他一定会的。身为一名骑士和至尊王的本分。我想阿斯兰喜欢这种风度。可那畜生马上就会站起来，那就……”

不过，“那畜生”再也站不起来了。格罗赛尔和索斯皮安两位大人早有准备。他们一见他们的国王倒地，马上跳进决斗场，高嚷：“背叛！背叛！纳尼亚叛徒们趁他倒地不起，在背后偷袭。拿起武器！战斗，台尔马！”

彼得还没反应过来出了什么事，就见到两个魁梧的人拔剑朝他冲来。接着，左侧又有一个台尔马人跨过绳子跳进场来。“战斗，纳尼亚。这是背叛！”彼得呐喊。要是那三个人一起攻击他，他不会再有说话的机会。但格罗赛尔先是捅死倒地的国王，剑刺入时他低声道：“这是对你今早侮辱的报复。”彼得转身面对索斯皮安，由下往上朝他双腿砍去，一击之下，回劈时砍下了他的脑袋。埃德蒙这时来到他身边，叫喊着：“纳尼亚！纳尼亚！阿斯兰！”整支台尔马军队朝他们拥来。就在这时，巨人噔噔走上前来，低下腰，挥舞开棒子。马人们勇猛冲锋。矮人们在后面砰砰放箭，箭矢嘶嘶地从头顶掠过。特鲁普金在他左边战斗。双方战斗全面爆发。

“退后，里皮契普，你这个小笨蛋！”彼得嚷道，“你这是送死。这不是老鼠待的地方。”可这些滑稽的小家伙在双方士兵的脚边蹦来蹦去，用剑猛刺。那天许多台尔马勇士感觉脚上猛地一阵刺痛，好像被十几只烤肉扦子给扎中，只好一边单腿跳着，一边痛得咒骂，许多人摔倒了。要是有人倒地，鼠兵们就会把他干掉；要是他没倒，总会有其他人倒地。

但正当老纳尼亚人杀得兴起时，他们发觉敌军不断撤退。面露凶狠的勇士们脸色发白，恐惧地盯着，不是盯着老纳尼亚人，而是他们身后的东西，然后纷纷扔下武器，尖叫着：“树林！树林！世界末日来临！”

但很快他们的叫喊声和武器的打斗声都听不见了，因为被唤醒的树林发出大海般的轰鸣，淹没了那些声音，那些树木汹涌地穿越彼得那一排排的军队，然后继续向前，追赶台尔马人。当狂野的西南风肆虐时，你是否曾在秋天的夜晚，站在大森林边高高的山脊上？想象那个声音。然后想象，那些树木不是待在原地不动，而是朝你汹涌而来；而且树木不再是树木，而是变成了巨人；可同时又还像树木，因为他们那长长的手臂像树枝一样挥舞着，他们的头摇摆着，树叶在他们身边纷纷落下。在台尔马人看来，他们就是这个样子。就算在纳尼亚人看来，也有点儿触目惊心。几分钟后，米亚兹所有的军队都跑到了大河边，试图过桥到对岸的贝鲁纳镇，然后凭借城墙和紧闭的城门来防守。

他们到达河边，却发现桥不见了。它昨天就消失了。他们极度惊恐，纷纷投降。

那大桥出了什么事？

当天清晨，睡了几小时后，女孩们醒来，见阿斯兰站在她们身旁，听他说道：“我们今天要庆祝节日。”她们揉了揉眼睛，四下看了看。树木们已经走掉了，还看得见他们黑压压的一群正往阿斯兰堡垒方向移动。酒神巴克斯和他的侍女们——那些热情疯狂的少女——以及森林之神西勒诺斯还跟她们待在一起。露西得到了充分休息，跳起身来。大家都醒了，人人欢笑，笛声响起，铙钹敲打起来。动物们，并非能言兽，从四面八方朝他们蜂拥而来。

“怎么回事，阿斯兰？”露西问道，她眼神飞扬起来，脚也忍不住地雀跃。

“来吧，孩子们，”他说，“今天再次骑上我的背。”

“噢，太好了！”露西叫起来，她们两人爬上他那温暖、金黄色的背，就像不知多少年前她们曾经做过的那样。然后整群人出发——阿斯兰在前领路，巴克斯和他的女侍们跑着，跳着，翻着筋斗，野兽们在他们身边活蹦乱跳，西勒诺斯和他的毛驴尾随在后。

他们稍稍向右转，快速走下一道陡峭的山坡，来到贝鲁纳长桥前。就在他们要过河时，忽然，从水里升起一个湿漉漉、满脸胡须的大脑袋，比人头要大，顶着芦苇头冠。他看着阿斯兰，嘴里发出低沉的声音：

“向主人致意，”他说，“请解开我的锁链。”

“那到底是谁？”苏珊低语。

“我想他是河神，别说话。”露西说。

“巴克斯，”阿斯兰说，“帮他解开锁链。”

“我猜，锁链指的是那座桥。”露西心想。确实如此。巴克斯和他的手下蹚水来到浅水处，一分钟后，最奇怪的事情发生了。粗大的常春藤沿着桥墩曲折向上，像蔓延的火焰一般迅速生长，包裹住石头，撕裂瓦解，把石头一块块分离。桥上的墙转眼间变成了山楂树树篱，色彩鲜艳；紧接着，整堵墙消失不见，而整座桥伴着隆隆的响声瞬间坍塌，落入涡流中。伴随着戏水声、尖叫声和欢笑声，狂欢者们或蹚水，或游着，或舞蹈着过了浅滩（“好哇！这里又变成了贝鲁纳浅滩！”女孩们喊道），他们在河对面上岸，然后进了城。

街上的人见到他们便四散而逃。他们最先来到一所学校：那是所女校，很多纳尼亚小女孩正在上历史课，她们头发扎得紧紧的，脖子上紧紧系着难看的衣领，脚上穿着厚得令人发痒的长筒袜。在米亚兹统治下，纳尼亚所教的“历史”比你读过的最真实的历史还要枯燥，比最激动人心的历险小说还要荒唐。

“格温德伦，要是你不专心听课，”一个女教师说，“我将扣你的纪律分，别再往窗外看。”

“听我说，普利兹小姐……”格温德伦开口。

“你没听到我刚才说的话吗，格温德伦？”普利兹小姐质问。

“听我说，普利兹小姐，”格温德伦说，“外面有一头狮子。”

“上课胡说八道，扣两分纪律分，”普利兹小姐说，“现在……”一声狮吼打断了她。常春藤从教室的窗户爬进来。四周的墙很快变成绿油油一片，长满叶子的枝条覆盖在头顶上，那里原是天花板。普利兹小姐发觉自己正站在森林空地的草坪上。她抓紧桌子想稳住自己，却见桌子变成了玫瑰花丛。她做梦都想不到的狂野人群向她围拢过来。接着她看到狮子，惊叫一声便逃跑了，跟她一起逃走的还有她班上的学生，她们大多是长着胖腿、循规蹈矩的矮胖小女孩。格温德伦犹豫着没走。

“你愿意加入我们吗，亲爱的？”阿斯兰问。

“噢，我可以吗？谢谢，谢谢。”格温德伦说。她立刻拉起两位侍女的手，她们让她转起圈来，一起跳起欢快的舞蹈，还帮她脱下那些不舒服的累赘衣服。

在贝鲁纳小镇上，他们每到一处，情形都一样。多数人逃开，有些人则加入他们的行列。当他们离开小镇时，他们的队伍更庞大，大家也更开心。

他们席卷一般穿过河流北岸（即左岸）的平原。每经过一个农庄，牲口们都会加入他们。那些忧伤的老毛驴，以前从不知快乐为何物，如今忽然焕发了青春；被锁着的狗挣脱了锁链；马儿蹬烂自己拉的车子，嘚嘚，嘚嘚地小跑着跟随他们，蹄下泥巴飞溅，嘶鸣不已。

在一座院子的水井边，他们见到一个男人正在鞭打一个男孩。那男人手里的棍子突然开了花。他想扔掉棍子，棍子却粘在了手上。他的手臂化成一根枝条，身体成了树干，脚生了根。刚才还在哭泣的男孩突然大笑起来，加入他们的队伍。

在去往两河交汇的河狸大坝的途中，他们经过一个小镇，来到另一所学校，一个神色疲倦的姑娘正在给一群男孩上算术课，那些男孩一脸蠢相，像猪一样。她朝窗外看去，见到极开心的狂欢人群，他们沿街欢唱，此景让她心里感到一阵喜悦。阿斯兰在窗下停了下来，仰望着她。

“噢，不，不，”她说，“我想去。可不能去。因为我必须忠于职守。孩子们要是见到你，会被吓坏的。”

“吓坏？”最像蠢猪的男孩说，“她正跟窗外什么人讲话？我们去报告督导员，说她在上课时间跟窗外的人谈话。”

“去看看是谁。”另一个男孩说，接着他们都拥到了窗边。可当他们那俗气的小脸刚朝外看时，巴克斯大喊起来：“尤安，尤——安！”那些男孩被吓得哀号起来，一个个互相踩踏着或夺门或跳窗而出。据说（不知真假），再也没人见过那些小男孩，不过当地倒是出现了很多不错的小猪，那里之前还不曾有过猪仔。

“走吧，亲爱的。”阿斯兰对那女教师说，她马上跳出窗子跟他们走了。

到了河狸大坝，他们再次蹚过河流，沿着南岸往东走。他们来到一间小屋，一个小孩正站在门边哭泣。“亲爱的，你为什么哭？”阿斯兰问。那个孩子从未见过狮子的图片，所以不怕他。“姨妈病得很厉害，”她说，“她就要死了。”阿斯兰走到小屋门前想进去，可对他而言，门太小了。这不，他先把头伸进去，然后用肩膀挤（他这么干时，露西和苏珊从他背上掉了下来），结果他把整间房子给顶了起来，接着房子向后倒去，散架了。他们眼前出现一个矮小的老妇人，还躺在床上，不过床成露天的了。这老妇看似有矮人的血统。她已经奄奄一息，可当她睁开眼，见到一个多毛、睿智的狮子脑袋正看着她，她没有尖叫或晕倒。她说：“啊，阿斯兰！我就知道传说不假。我等这一刻等了一辈子。你是来带我走的吗？”

“是的，最亲爱的，”阿斯兰说，“不过，不是去另一个世界的漫长旅途。”随着他的话语，如日出时云的底边被慢慢染红，她苍白的脸颊恢复了颜色，眼睛明亮起来，随后她坐起来说：“哎呀，我得说，感觉好多了。我觉得今早能吃些早餐。”

“早餐来了，大娘。”巴克斯回答她。他用水罐从小屋水井提水，然后递给她。不过，现在罐子里装的不是水，而是最浓郁的葡萄酒，颜色红似红酸栗果酱，油般润滑，跟牛肉一般有营养，温暖如茶，又如露水般清爽。

“嗯，你对我们的水井施了魔法，”老妇说，“这带来了好变化，真的。”接着，她从床上跳了起来。

“骑上我吧。”阿斯兰说。他又对苏珊和露西说：“你们两位女王现在得自己跑。”

“我们同样喜欢。”苏珊说。他们重新上路。

就这样，一路上他们雀跃着，跳着，唱着，伴随着音乐声、笑声、吼声、吠声、嘶鸣声，终于来到米亚兹军队缴械、举手投降的地方。彼得的军队，还握着武器，喘着粗气，包围了敌人，人人脸上既严肃又开心。他们抵达后发生的第一件事就是，那老妇人从阿斯兰的背上跳下来，穿过众人，跑到凯斯宾面前，然后拥抱在一起；原来她就是他那个老保姆。

第十五章　阿斯兰打造空间之门


一见到阿斯兰，台尔马士兵们的脸都被吓成了冷肉汁色，双腿战栗，很多人都吓得趴下了。他们从未信过关于狮子的传说，这使得他们更为恐惧。哪怕那些知道阿斯兰是友非敌的红矮人也惊得张着嘴，说不出话来。一些曾跟尼克布里克一伙的黑矮人悄悄退下。不过，所有能言兽都拥到阿斯兰身边，发出或咕噜，或吱吱，或咴咴等喜悦的叫声，朝他摇摆着尾巴，蹭着他，用鼻子虔诚地嗅着他，在他身下腿边钻来钻去。要是见过小猫咪跟它熟悉信任的大狗在一起亲昵的话，你就可以想象此情此景。过了一会儿，彼得领着凯斯宾从动物群里挤了过来。

“陛下，这位是凯斯宾。”他说。凯斯宾跪地，亲吻阿斯兰的前爪。

“欢迎，王子，”阿斯兰说，“你觉得自己足以担当起纳尼亚之王的重任吗？”

“我……我觉得自己不行，陛下，”凯斯宾说，“我还只是一个孩子。”

“不错，”阿斯兰说，“要是你觉得自己够格的话，那反倒证明你不行。因此，我们和至尊王任命你为纳尼亚之王、凯尔帕拉维尔的君主，以及孤独岛的皇帝。你和你的继承人将永远统治纳尼亚，直至你们族类消亡。你的加冕典礼……这是怎么了？”这时一支奇怪的小队走了过来——那是十一只老鼠，其中六个抬着一副枝条做的担架，上面躺着什么东西，那担架也不过一本地图册的大小。没人见过比他们更忧伤的老鼠了。他们一身泥，有些还一身血，耳朵耷拉着，胡须低垂，尾巴拖在草地上，领头的一个用纤细的笛子吹奏着忧伤的曲调。小担架上放着看似长有毛的湿乎乎的一摊；那是里皮契普残缺不全的身体。他还有呼吸，但已是半死不活，一身的刀伤，一只爪子被压碎了，尾巴只剩下包着纱布的残段。

“该你了，露西。”阿斯兰说。

露西立刻取出她的钻石瓶子。虽说里皮契普的每个伤口只需点上一滴就能好，可伤口太多，大家焦急沉默地等待了很久，她才完成，随即老鼠大人从担架上跃起。他立即手扶剑柄，另一只手捻着胡须，躬身致意。

“万岁，阿斯兰！”他那尖嗓子响起，“很荣幸……”他突然打住。

事实是，他依旧缺少尾巴，也许是露西忘了医治，也许是她那甘露虽说能愈合伤口，却无法让失去的再生。里皮契普鞠躬时意识到自己没了尾巴，或许那改变了身体的某种平衡。他从右肩看过去，没见到尾巴，他又伸长脖子，直至肩膀和整个身躯都跟着扭转。这一扭之下，他的后腿和屁股也跟着转离视线。接着他又使劲伸着脖子往肩后看，结果还是一样。转了三圈，他才意识到这个可怕的事实。

“我很困惑，”里皮契普对阿斯兰说，“我完全不知该怎么办了。在您面前如此不得体，我恳求您的谅解。”

“这没什么不妥，小家伙。”阿斯兰说。

“尽管如此，”里皮契普回答，“要是能补救的话……也许女王陛下？”他向露西欠身。

“但你要尾巴做什么用呢？”阿斯兰问。

“陛下，”老鼠说，“就算没有尾巴，我也一样能吃能睡，能为我的国王效力。但尾巴对老鼠来说意味着尊敬和荣誉。”

“朋友，我有时觉得，”阿斯兰说，“你是否太过于在意你的荣誉了？”

“至高无上的王，”里皮契普说，“请允许我提醒您，我们老鼠生来体形微小，假如我们不捍卫自己的尊严，某些人（那些以身高来衡量价值的人）就会随意拿我们开些很不得体的玩笑。因此，我竭力让大家了解，要是谁不想在自己的心窝上感受这把剑能插得有多深，就不要当着我的面谈论老鼠夹、偷奶酪，或爬烛台什么的：这样绝对不行，阁下，哪怕是纳尼亚最高大的傻瓜也不行！”说到这里，他仰头狠狠地瞪着威伯维德，不过那巨人总是比别人反应慢一拍，还没意识到有人就在他脚边影射他，因此没领会那个暗示。

“请问，你的士兵为什么都把剑拔了出来？”阿斯兰问。

“回禀陛下，”老鼠副将说，他名叫皮皮契克，“假如我们的头儿从此再无尾巴，我们准备把自己的尾巴割掉。既然我们鼠王失去尾巴这个荣耀，那么我们留着这个荣耀就可耻了。”

“啊！”阿斯兰大声感叹，“你们感动了我。你们心灵伟大。里皮契普，不是为了你的尊严，而是为了你们之间的友爱，更是为了感谢你们鼠族很久以前对我表现出的善意，因为是你们咬断了把我捆在石桌上的绳索（从那时起，你们变成了能言鼠，也许你们早忘了这事），为此，你将重新得到你的尾巴。”

阿斯兰还没说完，新尾巴就复原了。接着，在阿斯兰的指示下，彼得授予凯斯宾狮王军团骑士称号，被封为骑士之后，凯斯宾便自己授予特鲁弗亨特、特鲁普金和里皮契普骑士头衔，任命科涅利尔斯博士为大法官，并确认胖熊决斗司令官的世袭职位。这些任命获得了热烈掌声。

完成这些安排后，台尔马士兵们被坚决押往对岸，他们一路上没受什么奚落和拳脚，只是被关押在贝鲁纳镇，还供应他们牛肉和啤酒。他们在蹚水过河时闹出了很大动静，因为就像憎恨、害怕森林和动物一样，他们也憎恨、害怕流水。不过，这些麻烦事最终都解决了，接着那漫长的一天中最美好的时段开始了。

露西，紧挨阿斯兰坐着，感觉舒服极了，这时她好奇那些树在做什么。开始她以为他们不过是在跳舞；他们确实是围成两个圈子缓慢转圈，一圈是逆时针转动，另一圈是顺时针转动。接着她注意到，他们不停地往两个圈子中心扔东西。她一会儿觉得他们正割下自己长长的发缕，一会儿又觉得他们似乎在拗折自己的手指——不过，就算那样，他们仍有很多手指，而且不会受伤。不管他们扔的是什么，那些东西一落到地上，就变成枯枝干柴。然后三四个红矮人带着火绒盒走上前来，点燃柴堆，刚开始还是噼噼啪啪的火星，很快火苗跳将起来，最后像仲夏夜的森林篝火一般熊熊燃烧。大家都围成大圈坐在篝火旁。

这时巴克斯、西勒诺斯，还有那些酒神侍女开始跳舞，那舞蹈比那些树跳的舞狂野多了；那不仅仅是展现欢乐和美的舞蹈（当然也包括欢乐和美），还是带来丰富美食的魔力之舞。凡是他们手触之处，凡是他们脚踏之地，盛宴就出现在眼前——有片片香气四溢的烤肉，肉香充满整片林子，有小麦饼和燕麦饼、蜂蜜、彩色糖，稠得跟粥一样而又丝滑如静水的奶油，有成堆的各色水果，如水蜜桃、油桃、石榴、梨子、葡萄、草莓、红梅等。接着，葡萄酒呈了上来，盛在木质杯、碗和大盏里，容器周边缠绕着常春藤；酒水色泽不一，有深色的，色浓如桑葚果汁，有清亮的红色，透亮如液态的红色咖喱，有黄的，有绿的，有黄绿色的，有绿黄色的，不一而足。

给树人提供的是另类食物。当露西见到鼹鼠泥铲子和他的伙伴在不同地方翻起草皮（巴克斯指点他们地点），并意识到树人要吃土时，她不寒而栗。不过，当她看到给他们呈上的泥土时，她有了不同感受。他们吃的第一道沃土是深褐色的，看起来几乎跟巧克力相差无几；实际上，因为太像巧克力了，埃德蒙还尝了一块，不过他觉得难吃。用营养的沃土充饥后，树木转而吃起一种几乎是粉红色的土，类似的土壤可以在英国萨默赛特地区见到。据说要更清淡、更甜。充当奶酪呈上的是白垩土，接着他们吃起了可口的甜食，那是细细的沙砾，还撒上了精心挑选的银沙。他们喝了很少一点儿酒，冬青树因而变得多起话来：大多时候他们以夹杂着雨露的空气解渴，那其中混杂着森林里的花香，还带有最轻盈的云的气息。

就这样，阿斯兰盛情款待纳尼亚人，直至晚霞消散，繁星当空；那巨大的篝火，此时更为温暖，不再那么喧嚣，像灯塔一样照亮了黑暗的树林，那些惊恐的台尔马人远远看到，都在猜想那意味着什么。这场盛宴最大的优点就是没有曲终人散的遗憾，不过，随着交谈声减弱变慢，他们个个打起瞌睡，最后熟睡过去，而且都挨着好友，脚冲着火堆躺着。圈子周围终于安静下来，又能听到从贝鲁纳浅滩传来的潺潺流水声。阿斯兰整晚凝视着皎洁的月亮，眼神专注而愉悦。

第二天，信使们（主要是松鼠和小鸟）被派往王国各地散发公告，通知散居的台尔马人——当然包括那些囚禁在贝鲁纳的战俘。通告全境，凯斯宾如今成为纳尼亚新君，纳尼亚从今往后不但属于人类，同样属于能言兽、矮人、树精、羊人，以及其他生物。任何接受新情势选择留下的，可以留在纳尼亚；那些不想留下的，阿斯兰会提供新家园。那些想去往新居住地的，务必于当月五号正午前赶往贝鲁纳浅滩，去见阿斯兰和国王们。你可以想象，这个通告给台尔马人带来多大的烦恼。他们中有些人，主要是年轻人，跟凯斯宾一样，听过很多古代传说，很高兴重回旧时光。他们开始跟其他生物友好相处。这些人都决定留在纳尼亚。但大多数年长的人，尤其是那些在米亚兹当权时期得势的人，很是闷闷不乐，根本不想待在一个人类不能称霸的国度。“跟那些耍把戏的动物生活在一起！绝不！”他们说。“还跟那些幽灵一起。”一些人战栗地补充道。“那些树精实际上就是幽灵。留下不妙。”他们疑心重重。“我不相信他们，”他们说，“不信那头可怕的狮子和那一套。他很快就会朝我们伸爪子，等着瞧吧。”他们同样不相信阿斯兰给他们提供新家园的提议。“很可能是把我们带去他的狮子窝，然后把我们一个个吃掉。”他们小声抱怨。他们越是议论，越是烦闷和疑虑。可是到了指定的日子，他们半数以上的人还是赶来了。

在林间空地的一头，阿斯兰命人立起两根木桩，比人高，约三英尺宽。第三块轻一些的木头横绑在那两根木桩的顶端，固定好，这整个东西看起来像一道大门，由虚无通往虚无。阿斯兰站在这道门前，彼得和凯斯宾分立左右两侧。他们身边围着苏珊、露西、特鲁普金、特鲁弗亨特、科涅利尔斯大人、格兰斯托姆、里皮契普等人。孩子们和矮人们充分利用了米亚兹城堡里的宫廷衣饰——那城堡现在属于凯斯宾——装扮上丝绸和金丝衣物，雪白的亚麻斜袖很是闪亮，银质的盔甲，缀满宝石的剑柄，镀金的头盔，点缀着羽毛的帽子，他们一身炫目得几乎令人无法直视。就连那些野兽也都戴上了华丽的项链。但大家的目光并没有被他们和孩子们吸引。阿斯兰那生动光滑、金光闪闪的鬃毛让他们相形见绌。其他老纳尼亚人站在空地四周。台尔马人远离他们站在一处。阳光灿烂，锦旗在微风中飘扬。

“台尔马民众们，”阿斯兰说，“要寻找新家园的，请听我说。我会把你们都送回你们自己的国度，那个地方只有我知道，而你们不知道。”

“我们不记得台尔马。我们不知道它在哪里。我们不知道它是什么样的。”台尔马人发牢骚。

“你们从台尔马来到纳尼亚，”阿斯兰说，“但你们又是从另一个地方来到台尔马的。你们本不属于这个世界。好几代人以前，你们的人来到这里，你们跟至尊王都来自同一个世界。”

听到这里，半数台尔马人开始窃窃私语：“我早就这样说过。早就跟你们说过。他打算杀了我们，让我们从这个世界消失。”另外半数人则舒了口气，互相拍着对方的背，低声说：“我早就这样说过。早就猜到我们不属于这个地方，我们怎么会跟这些奇形怪状、令人厌恶、违反自然的家伙为伍。我们出身高贵，肯定是这样的。”就是凯斯宾、科涅利尔斯和孩子们听到这里也都转头望向阿斯兰，一脸的惊奇。

“安静。”阿斯兰嗓音低沉几近吼叫。大地似乎震颤了一下，林子里的每一个活物马上像石头般静立。

“你，凯斯宾陛下，”阿斯兰说，“你也许已经有所了解，除非你是亚当之子，像古代的国王们一样，来自亚当之子的那个国度，否则你不可能成为纳尼亚真正的国王。而你确实如此。很多年以前，在那个国度，在那个国家的大海深处，一个叫南海的地方，一船海盗被暴风雨吹到一座岛上。他们在岛上实施了海盗行径：屠杀当地人，掳掠当地妇人为妻，酿制棕榈酒，终日酗酒，醉倒在棕榈树下，醒来后又争斗不休，有时甚至自相残杀。在某次冲突中，有六人被其他人驱逐，他们带着他们的女人逃往岛的中部，爬上一座山，想进山洞躲藏起来。可那里是那个世界的魔洞之一，是那个世界和这个世界的裂缝或断层之一。在古代，不同世界之间有很多这样的裂缝和断层，但已经越来越稀少了。那里就是仅余的其中一处：注意，我没有说那是最后一个。于是他们跌落，或是上升，或是跌跌撞撞，或是直接摔了进去，接着他们发现自己来到了这个世界，来到了当时还无人居住的台尔马。至于为什么当时无人居住，这个说来话长：我现在不想讲这个。后来在台尔马，这些人的后代繁衍生息，成为一个强悍而骄傲的民族；又过了很多代，有一年台尔马发生了饥荒，他们侵略了纳尼亚，那时候的纳尼亚正处于混乱之中（这故事说来也长），于是他们征服并统治了纳尼亚。记住这些话了吗，凯斯宾国王？”

“我真的记住了，陛下，”凯斯宾说，“我希望我来自一个更可敬的祖先。”

“你的祖先是亚当和夏娃，”阿斯兰说，“这份荣耀足以让最贫贱的乞丐昂起头来，也足以令世上最伟大的帝王羞愧地低下头来。不要不满意。”

凯斯宾欠身答应。

“那么，”阿斯兰说，“台尔马的男男女女们，你们愿意回到你们父辈最初来的那个地方，人类世界的那座岛屿吗？那是个不错的地方。最初发现岛屿的海盗一族已经消亡，岛上目前无人居住。那里有很好的淡水井，肥沃的土壤，大量的木材可供建房，环礁湖里有丰富的鱼；那个世界的其他人尚未发现这岛屿。裂缝还开着，你们可以从那里回去；但有一点我必须要警告你们，一旦你们走过去，它就会在你们身后永远关闭。两个世界不会通过那道门有任何往来。”

大家沉默了一阵。随后，台尔马士兵中一个魁梧、相貌体面的人挤上前来，说：

“好吧，我接受这个安排。”

“明智的选择，”阿斯兰说，“因为你是第一个答应的，你将获得强大魔法的帮助。你在那个世界会有一个美好的未来。走上前来。”

那男子上前，脸色有些苍白。阿斯兰和他的臣子们闪到一边让路，让他自由通过那座木桩搭成的空空如也的通道。

“走过去，孩子。”阿斯兰倾身上前，鼻子碰了碰那人的鼻子。一呼吸到狮子的气息，那人的眼神立刻变了，又惊又喜，那神情像是努力要回忆起什么。然后，他挺直肩膀，走进门里。

每个人都注视着他。他们看到那三根木头，透过门看到纳尼亚的树木、草地和天空。他们看到那人来到门柱中间：接着在下一秒，他完全消失不见。

留在空地那头的台尔马人发出哀号：“啊！他出了什么事？你想谋杀我们？我们绝不走过去。”

其中一个机智的台尔马人说：“我们根本看不到那些木头外有任何其他世界。如果你想要取信于我们，那为什么你们当中没一个人走过去？你所有的朋友们都离那木门远远的。”

里皮契普立刻站出来，弯腰施礼。“要是我以身作则，能为您效力的话，阿斯兰，”他说，“只要你一声令下，我就会毫不迟疑地带领我的十一名部下走过那道门。”

“不，小家伙，”阿斯兰说，他将天鹅绒般柔软的爪子轻放在里皮契普的脑袋上，“在那个世界里，人们会用很卑劣的手段对付你们。他们将会展览你们。要领路离开的是其他人。”

“走吧，”彼得突然对埃德蒙和露西说，“我们的时间到了。”

“你什么意思？”埃德蒙说。

“从这里走，”苏珊像是知道怎么回事，“进树林。我们得换衣服。”

“换什么？”露西问。

“当然是我们的衣服，”苏珊说，“穿着这些衣服，在英国车站站台上，我们看起来会很傻。”

“但我们的行李在凯斯宾的城堡里。”埃德蒙说。

“不，行李不在那里，”彼得边说边领着他们进了密林深处，“都在这里。今天早上都打好包送来了。都安排好了。”

“今天早上阿斯兰跟你和苏珊谈的就是这事吗？”露西问。

“是的，这件事，还有其他事，”彼得说，神情严肃起来，“我不能都跟你讲。他有事想跟我和苏珊说，因为我们不能再回到纳尼亚了。”

“再也不能吗？”埃德蒙和露西沮丧地叫了起来。

“噢，你们两个还会回来，”彼得回答，“至少，从他的话里，我很肯定他的意思是你们俩某天会回来。但我和苏不会来了。他说我们年龄太大了。”

“噢，彼得，”露西说，“真不幸。你能承受这个打击吗？”

“嗯，我想我可以。”彼得说，“我现在的想法跟过去不一样。等你最后一次来纳尼亚时，你就能体会了。好了，赶紧，我们行李都在这里。”

脱下宫廷服饰，穿着他们的校服（已经不是很干净）回到集会人群中，感觉别扭，有些不适。有一两个较恶劣的台尔马人发出嘲笑。但其他伙伴们都起立欢呼，向至尊王彼得、号角女王苏珊、埃德蒙国王和露西女王表示敬意。他们跟所有的老朋友亲热告别，露西还哭了，场面热烈——动物式的亲吻，胖熊的拥抱，特鲁普金紧紧的握手，特鲁弗亨特最后的拥抱，他的胡须弄得人发痒。凯斯宾当然要把号角还给苏珊，当然啦，苏珊让他留着。最后，他们跟阿斯兰告别，既热烈又难过。彼得走在前面，苏珊随后，手搭着他的肩，埃德蒙手搭着苏珊的肩，露西手搭着埃德蒙的肩，排在最前的台尔马人手搭着露西的肩，就这样，他们排着长队朝那道门走去。接下来的那一刻难以描述，孩子们好像同时看到三种景象。其一是一个洞口，从洞口望去是太平洋某个海岛那耀眼的绿色和蓝色，台尔马人穿过门后就置身该岛。其二是纳尼亚的林间空地、矮人和野兽的脸，阿斯兰深邃的眼睛，还有獾脸上的白斑。其三（第三种景象很快就取代了其他两种）是一个乡村车站月台那灰色的碎石路面，一张长椅，周边摆着行李，他们都坐在长椅上，好像从没离开过。有了之前那么多经历，有那么一刻，他们感觉有些单调和沉闷，可出人意料地，又感觉这样也不错，又闻到了熟悉的车站气味，见到英国天空，再次面对他们的夏季学期。

“好啦！”彼得说，“我们这次玩得很痛快。”

“见鬼！”埃德蒙说，“我的新手电筒落在纳尼亚了。”

CHAPTER 1　THE ISLAND


ONCE there were four children whose names were Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy, and it has been told in another book called The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe how they had a remarkable adventure. They had opened the door of a magic wardrobe and found themselves in a quite different world from ours, and in that different world they had become Kings and Queens in a country called Narnia. While they were in Narnia they seemed to reign for years and years; but when they came back through the door and found themselves in England again, it all seemed to have taken no time at all. At any rate, no one noticed that they had ever been away, and they never told anyone except one very wise grown-up.

That had all happened a year ago, and now all four of them were sitting on a seat at a railway station with trunks and playboxes piled up round them. They were, in fact, on their way back to school. They had travelled together as far as this station, which was a junction; and here, in a few minutes, one train would arrive and take the girls away to one school, and in about half an hour another train would arrive and the boys would go off to another school. The first part of the journey, when they were all together, always seemed to be part of the holidays; but now when they would be saying good-bye and going different ways so soon, everyone felt that the holidays were really over and everyone felt their term-time feelings beginning again, and they were all rather gloomy and no one could think of anything to say. Lucy was going to boarding school for the first time.

It was an empty, sleepy, country station and there was hardly anyone on the platform except themselves. Suddenly Lucy gave a sharp little cry, like someone who has been stung by a wasp.

“What's up, Lu?” said Edmund—and then suddenly broke off and made a noise like “Ow!”

“What on earth—” began Peter, and then he too suddenly changed what he had been going to say. Instead, he said, “Susan, let go! What are you doing? Where are you dragging me to?”

“I'm not touching you,” said Susan. “Someone is pulling me. Oh— oh—oh—stop it!”

Everyone noticed that all the others' faces had gone very white.

“I felt just the same,” said Edmund in a breathless voice. “As if I were being dragged along. A most frightful pulling—ugh! it's beginning again.”

“Me too,” said Lucy. “Oh, I can't bear it.”

“Look sharp!” shouted Edmund. “All catch hands and keep together. This is magic—I can tell by the feeling. Quick!”

“Yes,” said Susan. “Hold hands. Oh, I do wish it would stop—oh!”

Next moment the luggage, the seat, the platform, and the station had completely vanished. The four children, holding hands and panting, found themselves standing in a woody place—such a woody place that branches were sticking into them and there was hardly room to move. They all rubbed their eyes and took a deep breath.

“Oh, Peter!” exclaimed Lucy. “Do you think we can possibly have got back to Narnia?”

“It might be anywhere,” said Peter, “I can't see a yard in all these trees. Let's try to get into the open—if there is any open.”

With some difficulty, and with some stings from nettles and pricks from thorns, they struggled out of the thicket. Then they had another surprise. Everything became much brighter, and after a few steps they found themselves at the edge of the wood, looking down on a sandy beach. A few yards away a very calm sea was falling on the sand with such tiny ripples that it made hardly any sound. There was no land in sight and no clouds in the sky. The sun was about where it ought to be at ten o'clock in the morning, and the sea was a dazzling blue. They stood sniffing in the sea-smell.

“By Jove!” said Peter. “This is good enough.”

Five minutes later everyone was barefooted and wading in the cool clear water.

“This is better than being in a stuffy train on the way back to Latin and French and Algebra!” said Edmund. And then for quite a long time there was no more talking, only splashing and looking for shrimps and crabs.

“All the same,” said Susan presently, “I suppose we'll have to make some plans. We shall want something to eat before long.”

“We've got the sandwiches Mother gave us for the journey,” said Edmund. “At least I've got mine.”

“Not me,” said Lucy. “Mine were in my little bag.”

“So were mine,” said Susan.

“Mine are in my coat-pocket, there on the beach,” said Peter. “That'll be two lunches among four. This isn't going to be such fun.”

“At present,” said Lucy, “I want something to drink more than something to eat.”

Everyone else now felt thirsty, as one usually is after wading in salt water under a hot sun.

“It's like being shipwrecked,” remarked Edmund. “In the books they always find springs of clear, fresh water on the island. We'd better go and look for them.”

“Does that mean we have to go back into all that thick wood?” said Susan.

“Not a bit of it,” said Peter. “If there are streams they're bound to come down to the sea, and if we walk along the beach we're bound to come to them.”

They all now waded back and went first across the smooth, wet sand and then up to the dry, crumbly sand that sticks to one's toes, and began putting on their shoes and socks. Edmund and Lucy wanted to leave them behind and do their exploring with bare feet, but Susan said this would be a mad thing to do. “We might never find them again,” she pointed out, “and we shall want them if we're still here when night comes and it begins to be cold.”

When they were dressed again they set out along the shore with the sea on their left hand and the wood on their right. Except for an occasional seagull it was a very quiet place. The wood was so thick and tangled that they could hardly see into it at all; and nothing in it moved—not a bird, not even an insect.

Shells and seaweed and anemones, or tiny crabs in rock-pools, are all very well, but you soon get tired of them if you are thirsty. The children's feet, after the change from the cool water, felt hot and heavy. Susan and Lucy had raincoats to carry. Edmund had put down his coat on the station seat just before the magic overtook them, and he and Peter took it in turns to carry Peter's greatcoat.

Presently the shore began to curve round to the right. About quarter of an hour later, after they had crossed a rocky ridge which ran out into a point, it made quite a sharp turn. Their backs were now to the part of the sea which had met them when they first came out of the wood, and now, looking ahead, they could see across the water another shore, thickly wooded like the one they were exploring.

“I wonder, is that an island or do we join on to it presently?” said Lucy.

“Don't know,” said Peter, and they all plodded on in silence.

The shore that they were walking on drew nearer and nearer to the opposite shore, and as they came round each promontory the children expected to find the place where the two joined. But in this they were disappointed. They came to some rocks which they had to climb and from the top they could see a fair way ahead and— “Oh, bother!” said Edmund, “it's no good. We shan't be able to get to those other woods at all. We're on an island!”

It was true. At this point the channel between them and the opposite coast was only about thirty or forty yards wide; but they could now see that this was its narrowest place. After that, their own coast bent round to the right again and they could see open sea between it and the mainland. It was obvious that they had already come much more than half-way round the island.

“Look!” said Lucy suddenly. “What's that?” She pointed to a long silvery, snake-like thing that lay across the beach.

“A stream! A stream!” shouted the others, and, tired as they were, they lost no time in clattering down the rocks and racing to the fresh water. They knew that the stream would be better to drink farther up, away from the beach, so they went at once to the spot where it came out of the wood. The trees were as thick as ever, but the stream had made itself a deep course between high mossy banks so that by stooping you could follow it up in a sort of tunnel of leaves. They dropped on their knees by the first brown, dimply pool and drank and drank, and dipped their faces in the water, and then dipped their arms in up to the elbow.

“Now,” said Edmund, “what about those sandwiches?”

“Oh, hadn't we better save them?” said Susan. “We may need them far worse later on.”

“I do wish,” said Lucy, “now that we're not thirsty, we could go on feeling as not-hungry as we did when we were thirsty.”

“But what about those sandwiches?” repeated Edmund. “There's no good saving them till they go bad. You've got to remember it's a good deal hotter here than in England and we've been carrying them about in pockets for hours.” So they got out the two packets and divided them into four portions, and nobody had quite enough, but it was a great deal better than nothing. Then they talked about their plans for the next meal. Lucy wanted to go back to the sea and catch shrimps, until someone pointed out that they had no nets. Edmund said they must gather gulls' eggs from the rocks, but when they came to think of it they couldn't remember having seen any gulls' eggs and wouldn't be able to cook them if they found any. Peter thought to himself that unless they had some stroke of luck they would soon be glad to eat eggs raw, but he didn't see any point in saying this out loud. Susan said it was a pity they had eaten the sandwiches so soon. One or two tempers very nearly got lost at this stage. Finally Edmund said:

“Look here. There's only one thing to be done. We must explore the wood. Hermits and knights-errant and people like that always manage to live somehow if they're in a forest. They find roots and berries and things.”

“What sort of roots?” asked Susan.

“I always thought it meant roots of trees,” said Lucy.

“Come on,” said Peter, “Ed is right. And we must try to do something. And it'll be better than going out into the glare and the sun again.”

So they all got up and began to follow the stream. It was very hard work. They had to stoop under branches and climb over branches, and they blundered through great masses of stuff like rhododendrons and tore their clothes and got their feet wet in the stream; and still there was no noise at all except the noise of the stream and the noises they were making themselves. They were beginning to get very tired of it when they noticed a delicious smell, and then a flash of bright colour high above them at the top of the right bank.

“I say!” exclaimed Lucy. “I do believe that's an apple tree.”

It was. They panted up the steep bank, forced their way through some brambles, and found themselves standing round an old tree that was heavy with large yellowish-golden apples as firm and juicy as you could wish to see.

“And this is not the only tree,” said Edmund with his mouth full of apple. “Look there—and there.”

“Why, there are dozens of them,” said Susan, throwing away the core of her first apple and picking her second. “This must have been an orchard—long, long ago, before the place went wild and the wood grew up.”

“Then this was once an inhabited island,” said Peter.

“And what's that?” said Lucy, pointing ahead.

“By Jove, it's a wall,” said Peter. “An old stone wall.”

Pressing their way between the laden branches they reached the wall. It was very old, and broken down in places, with moss and wallflowers growing on it, but it was higher than all but the tallest trees. And when they came quite close to it they found a great arch which must once have had a gate in it but was now almost filled up with the largest of all the apple trees. They had to break some of the branches to get past, and when they had done so they all blinked because the daylight became suddenly much brighter. They found themselves in a wide open place with walls all round it. In here there were no trees, only level grass and daisies, and ivy, and grey walls. It was a bright, secret, quiet place, and rather sad; and all four stepped out into the middle of it, glad to be able to straighten their backs and move their limbs freely.





CHAPTER 2　THE ANCIENT TREASURE HOUSE


“THIS wasn't a garden,” said Susan presently. “It was a castle and this must have been the courtyard.”

“I see what you mean,” said Peter. “Yes. That is the remains of a tower. And there is what used to be a flight of steps going up to the top of the walls. And look at those other steps—the broad, shallow ones—going up to that doorway. It must have been the door into the great hall.”

“Ages ago, by the look of it,” said Edmund.

“Yes, ages ago,” said Peter. “I wish we could find out who the people were that lived in this castle; and how long ago.”

“It gives me a queer feeling,” said Lucy.

“Does it, Lu?” said Peter, turning and looking hard at her. “Because it does the same to me. It is the queerest thing that has happened this queer day. I wonder where we are and what it all means?”

While they were talking they had crossed the courtyard and gone through the other doorway into what had once been the hall. This was now very like the courtyard, for the roof had long since disappeared and it was merely another space of grass and daisies, except that it was shorter and narrower and the walls were higher. Across the far end there was a kind of terrace about three feet higher than the rest.

“I wonder, was it really the hall?” said Susan. “What is that terrace kind of thing?”

“Why, you silly,” said Peter (who had become strangely excited), “don't you see? That was the dais where the High Table was, where the King and the great lords sat. Anyone would think you had forgotten that we ourselves were once Kings and Queens and sat on a dais just like that, in our great hall.”

“In our castle of Cair Paravel,” continued Susan in a dreamy and rather sing song voice, “at the mouth of the great river of Narnia. How could I forget?”

“How it all comes back!” said Lucy. “We could pretend we were in Cair Paravel now. This hall must have been very like the great hall we feasted in.”

“But unfortunately without the feast,” said Edmund. “It's getting late, you know. Look how long the shadows are. And have you noticed that it isn't so hot?”

“We shall need a camp-fire if we've got to spend the night here,” said Peter. “I've got matches. Let's go and see if we can collect some dry wood.”

Everyone saw the sense of this, and for the next half-hour they were busy. The orchard through which they had first come into the ruins turned out not to be a good place for firewood. They tried the other side of the castle, passing out of the hall by a little side door into a maze of stony humps and hollows which must once have been passages and smaller rooms but was now all nettles and wild roses. Beyond this they found a wide gap in the castle wall and stepped through it into a wood of darker and bigger trees where they found dead branches and rotten wood and sticks and dry leaves and fir-cones in plenty. They went to and fro with bundles until they had a good pile on the dais. At the fifth journey they found the well, just outside the hall, hidden in weeds, but clean and fresh and deep when they had cleared these away. The remains of a stone pavement ran half-way round it. Then the girls went out to pick some more apples and the boys built the fire, on the dais and fairly close to the corner between two walls, which they thought would be the snuggest and warmest place. They had great difficulty in lighting it and used a lot of matches, but they succeeded in the end. Finally, all four sat down with their backs to the wall and their faces to the fire. They tried roasting some of the apples on the ends of sticks. But roast apples are not much good without sugar, and they are too hot to eat with your fingers till they are too cold to be worth eating. So they had to content themselves with raw apples, which, as Edmund said, made one realise that school suppers weren't so bad after all— “I shouldn't mind a good thick slice of bread and margarine this minute,” he added. But the spirit of adventure was rising in them all, and no one really wanted to be back at school.

Shortly after the last apple had been eaten, Susan went out to the well to get another drink. When she came back she was carrying something in her hand.

“Look,” she said in a rather choking kind of voice. “I found it by the well.” She handed it to Peter and sat down. The others thought she looked and sounded as if she might be going to cry. Edmund and Lucy eagerly bent forward to see what was in Peter's hand—a little, bright thing that gleamed in the firelight.

“Well, I'm—I'm jiggered,” said Peter, and his voice also sounded queer. Then he handed it to the others.

All now saw what it was—a little chess-knight, ordinary in size but extraordinarily heavy because it was made of pure gold; and the eyes in the horse's head were two tiny little rubies—or rather one was, for the other had been knocked out.

“Why!” said Lucy, “it's exactly like one of the golden chessmen we used to play with when we were Kings and Queens at Cair Paravel.”

“Cheer up, Su,” said Peter to his other sister.

“I can't help it,” said Susan. “It brought back—oh, such lovely times. And I remembered playing chess with fauns and good giants, and the merpeople singing in the sea, and my beautiful horse—and—and——”

“Now,” said Peter in a quite different voice, “it's about time we four started using our brains.”

“What about?” asked Edmund.

“Have none of you guessed where we are?” said Peter.

“Go on, go on,” said Lucy. “I've felt for hours that there was some wonderful mystery hanging over this place.”

“Fire ahead, Peter,” said Edmund. “We're all listening.”

“We are in the ruins of Cair Paravel itself,” said Peter.

“But, I say,” replied Edmund. “I mean, how do you make that out? This place has been ruined for ages. Look at all those big trees growing right up to the gates. Look at the very stones. Anyone can see that nobody has lived here for hundreds of years.”

“I know,” said Peter. “That is the difficulty. But let's leave that out for the moment. I want to take the points one by one. First point: this hall is exactly the same shape and size as the hall at Cair Paravel. Just picture a roof on this, and a coloured pavement instead of grass, and tapestries on the walls, and you get our royal banqueting hall.”

No one said anything.

“Second point,” continued Peter. “The castle well is exactly where our well was, a little to the south of the great hall; and it is exactly the same size and shape.”

Again there was no reply.

“Third point: Susan has just found one of our old chessmen—or something as like one of them as two peas.”

Still nobody answered.

“Fourth point. Don't you remember—it was the very day before the ambassadors came from the King of Calormen—don't you remember planting the orchard outside the north gate of Cair Paravel? The greatest of all the wood-people, Pomona herself, came to put good spells on it. It was those very decent little chaps the moles who did the actual digging. Can you have forgotten that funny old Lilygloves, the chief mole, leaning on his spade and saying, ‘Believe me, your Majesty, you'll be glad of these fruit trees one day.’ And by Jove he was right.”

“I do! I do!” said Lucy, and clapped her hands.

“But look here, Peter,” said Edmund. “This must be all rot. To begin with, we didn't plant the orchard slap up against the gate. We wouldn't have been such fools.”

“No, of course not,” said Peter. “But it has grown up to the gate since.”

“And for another thing,” said Edmund, “Cair Paravel wasn't on an island.”

“Yes, I've been wondering about that. But it was a what-do-youcall-it, a peninsula. Jolly nearly an island. Couldn't it have been made an island since our time? Somebody has dug a channel.”

“But half a moment!” said Edmund. “You keep on saying since our time. But it's only a year ago since we came back from Narnia. And you want to make out that in one year castles have fallen down, and great forests have grown up, and little trees we saw planted ourselves have turned into a big old orchard, and goodness knows what else. It's all impossible.”

“There's one thing,” said Lucy. “If this is Cair Paravel there ought to be a door at this end of the dais. In fact we ought to be sitting with our backs against it at this moment. You know—the door that led down to the treasure chamber.”

“I suppose there isn't a door,” said Peter, getting up.

The wall behind them was a mass of ivy.

“We can soon find out,” said Edmund, taking up one of the sticks that they had laid ready for putting on the fire. He began beating the ivied wall. Tap-tap went the stick against the stone; and again, tap-tap; and then, all at once, boom-boom, with a quite different sound, a hollow, wooden sound.

“Great Scott!” said Edmund.

“We must clear this ivy away,” said Peter.

“Oh, do let's leave it alone,” said Susan. “We can try it in the morning. If we've got to spend the night here I don't want an open door at my back and a great big black hole that anything might come out of, besides the draught and the damp. And it'll soon be dark.”

“Susan! How can you?” said Lucy with a reproachful glance. But both the boys were too much excited to take any notice of Susan's advice. They worked at the ivy with their hands and with Peter's pocket-knife till the knife broke. After that they used Edmund's. Soon the whole place where they had been sitting was covered with ivy; and at last they had the door cleared.

“Locked, of course,” said Peter.

“But the wood's all rotten,” said Edmund. “We can pull it to bits in no time, and it will make extra firewood. Come on.”

It took them longer than they expected and, before they had done, the great hall had grown dusky and the first star or two had come out overhead. Susan was not the only one who felt a slight shudder as the boys stood above the pile of splintered wood, rubbing the dirt off their hands and staring into the cold, dark opening they had made.

“Now for a torch,” said Peter.

“Oh, what is the good?” said Susan. “And as Edmund said—”

“I'm not saying it now,” Edmund interrupted. “I still don't understand, but we can settle that later. I suppose you're coming down, Peter?”

“We must,” said Peter. “Cheer up, Susan. It's no good behaving like kids now that we are back in Narnia. You're a queen here. And anyway no one could go to sleep with a mystery like this on their minds.”

They tried to use long sticks as torches but this was not a success. If you held them with the lighted end up they went out, and if you held them the other way they scorched your hand and the smoke got in your eyes. In the end they had to use Edmund's electric torch; luckily it had been a birthday present less than a week ago and the battery was almost new. He went first, with the light. Then came Lucy, then Susan, and Peter brought up the rear.

“I've come to the top of the steps,” said Edmund.

“Count them,” said Peter.

“One—two—three,” said Edmund, as he went cautiously down, and so up to sixteen. “And this is the bottom,” he shouted back.

“Then it really must be Cair Paravel,” said Lucy. “There were sixteen.” Nothing more was said till all four were standing in a knot together at the foot of the stairway. Then Edmund flashed his torch slowly round.

“O—o—o—oh!!” said all the children at once.

For now all knew that it was indeed the ancient treasure chamber of Cair Paravel where they had once reigned as Kings and Queens of Narnia. There was a kind of path up the middle (as it might be in a greenhouse), and along each side at intervals stood rich suits of armour, like knights guarding the treasures. In between the suits of armour, and on each side of the path, were shelves covered with precious things—necklaces and arm rings and finger rings and golden bowls and dishes and long tusks of ivory, brooches and coronets and chains of gold, and heaps of unset stones lying piled anyhow as if they were marbles or potatoes—diamonds, rubies, carbuncles, emeralds, topazes, and amethysts. Under the shelves stood great chests of oak strengthened with iron bars and heavily padlocked. And it was bitterly cold, and so still that they could hear themselves breathing, and the treasures were so covered with dust that unless they had realised where they were and remembered most of the things, they would hardly have known they were treasures. There was something sad and a little frightening about the place, because it all seemed so forsaken and long ago. That was why nobody said anything for at least a minute.

Then, of course, they began walking about and picking things up to look at. It was like meeting very old friends. If you had been there you would have heard them saying things like, “Oh look! Our coronation rings—do you remember first wearing this?—Why, this is the little brooch we all thought was lost—I say, isn't that the armour you wore in the great tournament in the Lone Islands?—do you remember the dwarf making that for me?—do you remember drinking out of that horn?—do you remember, do you remember?”

But suddenly Edmund said, “Look here. We mustn't waste the battery: goodness knows how often we shall need it. Hadn't we better take what we want and get out again?”

“We must take the gifts,” said Peter. For long ago at a Christmas in Narnia he and Susan and Lucy had been given certain presents which they valued more than their whole kingdom. Edmund had had no gift, because he was not with them at the time. (This was his own fault, and you can read about it in the other book.)

They all agreed with Peter and walked up the path to the wall at the far end of the treasure chamber, and there, sure enough, the gifts were still hanging. Lucy's was the smallest for it was only a little bottle. But the bottle was made of diamond instead of glass, and it was still more than half full of the magical cordial which would heal almost every wound and every illness. Lucy said nothing and looked very solemn as she took her gift down from its place and slung the belt over her shoulder and once more felt the bottle at her side where it used to hang in the old days. Susan's gift had been a bow and arrows and a horn. The bow was still there, and the ivory quiver, full of well-feathered arrows, but— “Oh, Susan,” said Lucy. “Where's the horn?”

“Oh bother, bother, bother,” said Susan after she had thought for a moment. “I remember now. I took it with me the last day of all, the day we went hunting the White Stag. It must have got lost when we blundered back into that other place—England, I mean.”

Edmund whistled. It was indeed a shattering loss; for this was an enchanted horn and, whenever you blew it, help was certain to come to you, wherever you were.

“Just the sort of thing that might come in handy in a place like this,” said Edmund.

“Never mind,” said Susan, “I've still got the bow.” And she took it.

“Won't the string be perished, Su?” said Peter.

But whether by some magic in the air of the treasure chamber or not, the bow was still in working order. Archery and swimming were the things Susan was good at. In a moment she had bent the bow and then she gave one little pluck to the string. It twanged: a chirruping twang that vibrated through the whole room. And that one small noise brought back the old days to the children's minds more than anything that had happened yet. All the battles and hunts and feasts came rushing into their heads together.

Then she unstrung the bow again and slung the quiver at her side.

Next, Peter took down his gift—the shield with the great red lion on it, and the royal sword. He blew, and rapped them on the floor, to get off the dust. He fitted the shield on his arm and slung the sword by his side. He was afraid at first that it might be rusty and stick to the sheath. But it was not so. With one swift motion he drew it and held it up, shining in the torchlight.

“It is my sword Rhindon,” he said; “with it I killed the Wolf.” There was a new tone in his voice, and the others all felt that he was really Peter the High King again. Then, after a little pause, everyone remembered that they must save the battery.

They climbed the stair again and made up a good fire and lay down close together for warmth. The ground was very hard and uncomfortable, but they fell asleep in the end.





CHAPTER 3　THE DWARF


THE worst of sleeping out of doors is that you wake up so dreadfully early. And when you wake you have to get up because the ground is so hard that you are uncomfortable. And it makes matters worse if there is nothing but apples for breakfast and you have had nothing but apples for supper the night before. When Lucy had said—truly enough—that it was a glorious morning, there did not seem to be anything else nice to be said. Edmund said what everyone was feeling, “We've simply got to get off this island.”

When they had drunk from the well and splashed their faces they all went down the stream again to the shore and stared at the channel which divided them from the mainland.

“We'll have to swim,” said Edmund.

“It would be all right for Su,” said Peter (Susan had won prizes for swimming at school). “But I don't know about the rest of us.” By “the rest of us” he really meant Edmund who couldn't yet do two lengths at the school baths, and Lucy, who could hardly swim at all.

“Anyway,” said Susan, “there may be currents. Father says it's never wise to bathe in a place you don't know.”

“But, Peter,” said Lucy, “look here. I know I can't swim for nuts at home—in England, I mean. But couldn't we all swim long ago—if it was long ago—when we were Kings and Queens in Narnia? We could ride then too, and do all sorts of things. Don't you think—”

“Ah, but we were sort of grown-up then,” said Peter. “We reigned for years and years and learned to do things. Aren't we just back at our proper ages again now?”

“Oh!” said Edmund in a voice which made everyone stop talking and listen to him.

“I've just seen it all,” he said.

“Seen what?” asked Peter.

“Why, the whole thing,” said Edmund. “You know what we were puzzling about last night, that it was only a year ago since we left Narnia but everything looks as if no one had lived in Cair Paravel for hundreds of years? Well, don't you see? You know that, however long we seemed to have lived in Narnia, when we got back through the wardrobe it seemed to have taken no time at all?”

“Go on,” said Susan. “I think I'm beginning to understand.”

“And that means,” continued Edmund, “that, once you're out of Narnia, you have no idea how Narnian time is going. Why shouldn't hundreds of years have gone past in Narnia while only one year has passed for us in England?”

“By Jove, Ed,” said Peter. “I believe you've got it. In that sense it really was hundreds of years ago that we lived in Cair Paravel. And now we're coming back to Narnia just as if we were Crusaders or Anglo-Saxons or Ancient Britons or someone coming back to modern England!”

“How excited they'll be to see us—” began Lucy, but at the same moment everyone else said, “Hush!” or “Look!” For now something was happening.

There was a wooded point on the mainland a little to their right, and they all felt sure that just beyond that point must be the mouth of the river. And now, round that point there came into sight a boat. When it had cleared the point, it turned and began coming along the channel towards them. There were two people on board, one rowing, the other sitting in the stern and holding a bundle that twitched and moved as if it were alive. Both these people seemed to be soldiers. They had steel caps on their heads and light shirts of chain-mail. Their faces were bearded and hard. The children drew back from the beach into the wood and watched without moving a finger.

“This'll do,” said the soldier in the stern when the boat had come about opposite to them.

“What about tying a stone to his feet, Corporal?” said the other, resting on his oars.

“Garn!” growled the other. “We don't need that, and we haven't brought one. He'll drown sure enough without a stone, as long as we've tied the cords right.” With these words he rose and lifted his bundle. Peter now saw that it was really alive and was in fact a Dwarf, bound hand and foot but struggling as hard as he could. Next moment he heard a twang just beside his ear, and all at once the soldier threw up his arms, dropping the Dwarf in the bottom of the boat, and fell over into the water. He floundered away to the far bank and Peter knew that Susan's arrow had struck on his helmet. He turned and saw that she was very pale but was already fitting a second arrow to the string. But it was never used. As soon as he saw his companion fall, the other soldier, with a loud cry, jumped out of the boat on the far side, and he also floundered through the water (which was apparently just in his depth) and disappeared into the woods of the mainland.

“Quick! Before she drifts!” shouted Peter. He and Susan, fully dressed as they were, plunged in, and before the water was up to their shoulders their hands were on the side of the boat. In a few seconds they had hauled her to the bank and lifted the Dwarf out, and Edmund was busily engaged in cutting his bonds with the pocket knife. (Peter's sword would have been sharper, but a sword is very inconvenient for this sort of work because you can't hold it anywhere lower than the hilt.) When at last the dwarf was free, he sat up, rubbed his arms and legs, and exclaimed:

“Well, whatever they say, you don't feel like ghosts.”

Like most Dwarfs he was very stocky and deep-chested. He would have been about three feet high if he had been standing up, and an immense beard and whiskers of coarse red hair left little of his face to be seen except a beak-like nose and twinkling black eyes.

“Anyway,” he continued, “ghosts or not, you've saved my life and I'm extremely obliged to you.”

“But why should we be ghosts?” asked Lucy.

“I've been told all my life,” said the Dwarf, “that these woods along the shore were as full of ghosts as they were of trees. That's what the story is. And that's why, when they want to get rid of anyone, they usually bring him down here (like they were doing with me) and say they'll leave him to the ghosts. But I always wondered if they didn't really drown 'em or cut their throats. I never quite believed in the ghosts. But those two cowards you've just shot believed all right. They were more frightened of taking me to my death than I was of going!”

“Oh,” said Susan. “So that's why they both ran away.”

“Eh? What's that?” said the Dwarf.

“They got away,” said Edmund. “To the mainland.”

“I wasn't shooting to kill, you know,” said Susan. She would not have liked anyone to think she could miss at such a short range.

“Hm,” said the Dwarf. “That's not so good. That may mean trouble later on. Unless they hold their tongues for their own sake.”

“What were they going to drown you for?” asked Peter.

“Oh, I'm a dangerous criminal, I am,” said the Dwarf cheerfully. “But that's a long story. Meantime, I was wondering if perhaps you were going to ask me to breakfast? You've no idea what an appetite it gives one, being executed.”

“There's only apples,” said Lucy dolefully.

“Better than nothing, but not so good as fresh fish,” said the Dwarf. “It looks as if I'll have to ask you to breakfast instead. I saw some fishing tackle in that boat. And anyway, we must take her round to the other side of the island. We don't want anyone from the mainland coming down and seeing her.”

“I ought to have thought of that myself,” said Peter.

The four children and the Dwarf went down to the water's edge, pushed off the boat with some difficulty, and scrambled aboard. The Dwarf at once took charge. The oars were of course too big for him to use, so Peter rowed and the Dwarf steered them north along the channel and presently eastward round the tip of the island. From here the children could see right up the river, and all the bays and headlands of the coast beyond it. They thought they could recognise bits of it, but the woods, which had grown up since their time, made everything look very different.

When they had come round into open sea on the east of the island, the Dwarf took to fishing. They had an excellent catch of pavenders, a beautiful rainbow-coloured fish which they all remembered eating in Cair Paravel in the old days. When they had caught enough they ran the boat up into a little creek and moored her to a tree. The Dwarf, who was a most capable person (and, indeed, though one meets bad Dwarfs, I never heard of a Dwarf who was a fool), cut the fish open, cleaned them, and said:

“Now, what we want next is some firewood.”

“We've got some up at the castle,” said Edmund.

The Dwarf gave a low whistle. “Beards and bedsteads!” he said. “So there really is a castle, after all?”

“It's only a ruin,” said Lucy.

The Dwarf stared round at all four of them with a very curious expression on his face. “And who on earth—?” he began, but then broke off and said, “No matter. Breakfast first. But one thing before we go on. Can you lay your hand on your hearts and tell me I'm really alive? Are you sure I wasn't drowned and we're not all ghosts together?”

When they had all reassured him, the next question was how to carry the fish. They had nothing to string them on and no basket. They had to use Edmund's hat in the end because no one else had a hat. He would have made much more fuss about this if he had not by now been so ravenously hungry.

At first the Dwarf did not seem very comfortable in the castle. He kept looking round and sniffing and saying, “H'm. Looks a bit spooky after all. Smells like ghosts, too.” But he cheered up when it came to lighting the fire and showing them how to roast the fresh pavenders in the embers. Eating hot fish with no forks, and one pocket-knife between five people, is a messy business and there were several burnt fingers before the meal was ended; but, as it was now nine o'clock and they had been up since five, nobody minded the burns so much as you might have expected. When everyone had finished off with a drink from the well and an apple or so, the Dwarf produced a pipe about the size of his own arm, filled it, lit it, blew a great cloud of fragrant smoke, and said, “Now.”

“You tell us your story first,” said Peter. “And then we'll tell you ours.”

“Well,” said the Dwarf, “as you've saved my life it is only fair you should have your own way. But I hardly know where to begin. First of all I'm a messenger of King Caspian's.”

“Who's he?” asked four voices all at once.

“Caspian the Tenth, King of Narnia, and long may he reign!” answered the Dwarf. “That is to say, he ought to be King of Narnia and we hope he will be. At present he is only King of us Old Narnians—”

“What do you mean by old Narnians, please?” asked Lucy.

“Why, that's us,” said the Dwarf. “We're a kind of rebellion, I suppose.”

“I see,” said Peter. “And Caspian is the chief Old Narnian.”

“Well, in a manner of speaking,” said the Dwarf, scratching his head. “But he's really a New Narnian himself, a Telmarine, if you follow me.”

“I don't,” said Edmund.

“It's worse than the Wars of the Roses,” said Lucy.

“Oh dear,” said the Dwarf. “I'm doing this very badly. Look here: I think I'll have to go right back to the beginning and tell you how Caspian grew up in his uncle's court and how he comes to be on our side at all. But it'll be a long story.”

“All the better,” said Lucy. “We love stories.”

So the Dwarf settled down and told his tale. I shall not give it to you in his words, putting in all the children's questions and interruptions, because it would take too long and be confusing, and, even so, it would leave out some points that the children only heard later. But the gist of the story, as they knew it in the end, was as follows.





CHAPTER 4　THE DWARF TELLS OF PRINCE CASPIAN


PRINCE Caspian lived in a great castle in the centre of Narnia with his uncle, Miraz, the King of Narnia, and his aunt, who had red hair and was called Queen Prunaprismia. His father and mother were dead and the person whom Caspian loved best was his nurse, and though (being a prince) he had wonderful toys which would do almost anything but talk, he liked best the last hour of the day when the toys had all been put back in their cupboards and Nurse would tell him stories.

He did not care much for his uncle and aunt, but about twice a week his uncle would send for him and they would walk up and down together for half an hour on the terrace at the south side of the castle. One day, while they were doing this, the King said to him,

“Well, boy, we must soon teach you to ride and use a sword. You know that your aunt and I have no children, so it looks as if you might have to be King when I'm gone. How shall you like that, eh?”

“I don't know, Uncle,” said Caspian.

“Don't know, eh?” said Miraz. “Why, I should like to know what more anyone could wish for!”

“All the same, I do wish,” said Caspian.

“What do you wish?” asked the King.

“I wish—I wish—I wish I could have lived in the Old Days,” said Caspian. (He was only a very little boy at the time.)

Up till now King Miraz had been talking in the tiresome way that some grown-ups have, which makes it quite clear that they are not really interested in what they are saying, but now he suddenly gave Caspian a very sharp look.

“Eh? What's that?” he said. “What old days do you mean?”

“Oh, don't you know, Uncle?” said Caspian. “When everything was quite different. When all the animals could talk, and there were nice people who lived in the streams and the trees. Naiads and Dryads they were called. And there were Dwarfs. And there were lovely little Fauns in all the woods. They had feet like goats. And—”

“That's all nonsense, for babies,” said the King sternly. “Only fit for babies, do you hear? You're getting too old for that sort of stuff. At your age you ought to be thinking of battles and adventures, not fairy tales.”

“Oh, but there were battles and adventures in those days,” said Caspian. “Wonderful adventures. Once there was a White Witch and she made herself Queen of the whole country. And she made it so that it was always winter. And then two boys and two girls came from somewhere and so they killed the Witch and they were made Kings and Queens of Narnia, and their names were Peter and Susan and Edmund and Lucy. And so they reigned for ever so long and everyone had a lovely time, and it was all because of Aslan—”

“Who's he?” said Miraz. And if Caspian had been a very little older, the tone of his uncle's voice would have warned him that it would be wiser to shut up. But he babbled on,

“Oh, don't you know?” he said. “Aslan is the great Lion who comes from over the sea.”

“Who has been telling you all this nonsense?” said the King in a voice of thunder. Caspian was frightened and said nothing.

“Your Royal Highness,” said King Miraz, letting go of Caspian's hand, which he had been holding till now, “I insist upon being answered. Look me in the face. Who has been telling you this pack of lies?”

“N—Nurse,” faltered Caspian, and burst into tears.

“Stop that noise,” said his uncle, taking Caspian by the shoulders and giving him a shake. “Stop it. And never let me catch you talking—or thinking either—about all those silly stories again. There never were those Kings and Queens. How could there be two Kings at the same time? And there's no such person as Aslan. And there are no such things as lions. And there never was a time when animals could talk. Do you hear?”

“Yes, Uncle,” sobbed Caspian.

“Then let's have no more of it,” said the King. Then he called to one of the gentlemen-in-waiting who were standing at the far end of the terrace and said in a cold voice, “Conduct His Royal Highness to his apartments and send His Royal Highness's nurse to me AT ONCE.”




Next day Caspian found what a terrible thing he had done, for Nurse had been sent away without even being allowed to say good-bye to him, and he was told he was to have a Tutor.

Caspian missed his nurse very much and shed many tears; and because he was so miserable, he thought about the old stories of Narnia far more than before. He dreamed of Dwarfs and Dryads every night and tried very hard to make the dogs and cats in the castle talk to him. But the dogs only wagged their tails and the cats only purred.

Caspian felt sure that he would hate the new Tutor, but when the new Tutor arrived about a week later he turned out to be the sort of person it is almost impossible not to like. He was the smallest, and also the fattest, man Caspian had ever seen. He had a long, silvery, pointed beard which came down to his waist, and his face, which was brown and covered with wrinkles, looked very wise, very ugly, and very kind. His voice was grave and his eyes were merry so that, until you got to know him really well, it was hard to know when he was joking and when he was serious. His name was Doctor Cornelius.

Of all his lessons with Doctor Cornelius the one that Caspian liked best was History. Up till now, except for Nurse's stories, he had known nothing about the History of Narnia, and he was very surprised to learn that the royal family were newcomers in the country.

“It was your Highness's ancestor, Caspian the First,” said Doctor Cornelius, “who first conquered Narnia and made it his kingdom. It was he who brought all your nation into the country. You are not native Narnians at all. You are all Telmarines—that is, you all came from the Land of Telmar, far beyond the Western Mountains. That is why Caspian the First is called Caspian the Conqueror.”

“Please, Doctor,” asked Caspian one day, “who lived in Narnia before we all came here out of Telmar?”

“No men—or very few—lived in Narnia before the Telmarines took it,” said Doctor Cornelius.

“Then who did my great-great-grandcesters conquer?”

“Whom, not who, your Highness,” said Doctor Cornelius. “Perhaps it is time to turn from History to Grammar.”

“Oh please, not yet,” said Caspian. “I mean, wasn't there a battle? Why is he called Caspian the Conqueror if there was nobody here to fight with him?”

“I said there were very few men in Narnia,” said the Doctor, looking at the little boy very strangely through his great spectacles.

For a moment Caspian was puzzled and then suddenly his heart gave a leap. “Do you mean,” he gasped, “that there were other things? Do you mean it was like in the stories? Were there—?”

“Hush!” said Doctor Cornelius, laying his head very close to Caspian's. “Not a word more. Don't you know your Nurse was sent away for telling you about Old Narnia? The King doesn't like it. If he found me telling you secrets, you'd be whipped and I should have my head cut off.”

“But why?” asked Caspian.

“It is high time we turned to Grammar now,” said Doctor Cornelius in a loud voice. “Will your Royal Highness be pleased to open Pulverulentus Siccus at the fourth page of his Grammatical Garden or the Arbour of Accidence pleasantlie open'd to Tender Wits?”

After that it was all nouns and verbs till lunchtime, but I don't think Caspian learned much. He was too excited. He felt sure that Doctor Cornelius would not have said so much unless he meant to tell him more sooner or later.

In this he was not disappointed. A few days later his Tutor said, “Tonight I am going to give you a lesson in Astronomy. At dead of night two noble planets, Tarva and Alambil, will pass within one degree of each other. Such a conjunction has not occurred for two hundred years, and your Highness will not live to see it again. It will be best if you go to bed a little earlier than usual. When the time of the conjunction draws near, I will come and wake you.”

This didn't seem to have anything to do with Old Narnia, which was what Caspian really wanted to hear about, but getting up in the middle of the night is always interesting and he was moderately pleased. When he went to bed that night, he thought at first that he would not be able to sleep; but he soon dropped off and it seemed only a few minutes before he felt someone gently shaking him.

He sat up in bed and saw that the room was full of moonlight. Doctor Cornelius, muffled in a hooded robe and holding a small lamp in his hand, stood by the bedside. Caspian remembered at once what they were going to do. He got up and put on some clothes. Although it was a summer night he felt colder than he had expected and was quite glad when the Doctor wrapped him in a robe like his own and gave him a pair of warm, soft buskins for his feet. A moment later, both muffled so that they could hardly be seen in the dark corridors, and both shod so that they made almost no noise, master and pupil left the room.

Caspian followed the Doctor through many passages and up several staircases, and at last, through a little door in a turret, they came out upon the leads. On one side were the battlements, on the other a steep roof; below them, all shadowy and shimmery, the castle gardens; above them, stars and moon. Presently they came to another door, which led into the great central tower of the whole castle: Doctor Cornelius unlocked it and they began to climb the dark winding stair of the tower. Caspian was becoming excited; he had never been allowed up this stair before.

It was long and steep, but when they came out on the roof of the tower and Caspian had got his breath, he felt that it had been well worth it. Away on his right he could see, rather indistinctly, the Western Mountains. On his left was the gleam of the Great River, and everything was so quiet that he could hear the sound of the waterfall at Beaversdam, a mile away. There was no difficulty in picking out the two stars they had come to see. They hung rather low in the southern sky, almost as bright as two little moons and very close together.

“Are they going to have a collision?” he asked in an awestruck voice.

“Nay, dear Prince,” said the Doctor (and he too spoke in a whisper). “The great lords of the upper sky know the steps of their dance too well for that. Look well upon them. Their meeting is fortunate and means some great good for the sad realm of Narnia. Tarva, the Lord of Victory, salutes Alambil, the Lady of Peace. They are just coming to their nearest.”

“It's a pity that tree gets in the way,” said Caspian. “We'd really see better from the West Tower, though it is not so high.”

Doctor Cornelius said nothing for about two minutes, but stood still with his eyes fixed on Tarva and Alambil. Then he drew a deep breath and turned to Caspian.

“There,” he said. “You have seen what no man now alive has seen, nor will see again. And you are right. We should have seen it even better from the smaller tower. I brought you here for another reason.”

Caspian looked up at him, but the Doctor's hood concealed most of his face.

“The virtue of this tower,” said Doctor Cornelius, “is that we have six empty rooms beneath us, and a long stair, and the door at the bottom of the stair is locked. We cannot be overheard.”

“Are you going to tell me what you wouldn't tell me the other day?” said Caspian.

“I am,” said the Doctor. “But remember. You and I must never talk about these things except here—on the very top of the Great Tower.”

“No. That's a promise,” said Caspian. “But do go on, please.”

“Listen,” said the Doctor. “All you have heard about Old Narnia is true. It is not the land of Men. It is the country of Aslan, the country of the Waking Trees and Visible Naiads, of Fauns and Satyrs, of Dwarfs and Giants, of the gods and the Centaurs, of Talking Beasts. It was against these that the first Caspian fought. It is you Telmarines who silenced the beasts and the trees and the fountains, and who killed and drove away the Dwarfs and Fauns, and are now trying to cover up even the memory of them. The King does not allow them to be spoken of.”

“Oh, I do wish we hadn't,” said Caspian. “And I am glad it was all true, even if it is all over.”

“Many of your race wish that in secret,” said Doctor Cornelius.

“But, Doctor,” said Caspian, “why do you say my race? After all, I suppose you're a Telmarine too.”

“Am I?” said the Doctor.

“Well, you're a Man anyway,” said Caspian.

“Am I?” repeated the Doctor in a deeper voice, at the same moment throwing back his hood so that Caspian could see his face clearly in the moonlight.

All at once Caspian realised the truth and felt that he ought to have realised it long before. Doctor Cornelius was so small, and so fat, and had such a very long beard. Two thoughts came into his head at the same moment. One was a thought of terror— “He's not a real man, not a man at all, he's a Dwarf, and he's brought me up here to kill me.” The other was sheer delight— “There are real Dwarfs still, and I've seen one at last.”

“So you've guessed it in the end,” said Doctor Cornelius. “Or guessed it nearly right. I'm not a pure Dwarf. I have human blood in me too. Many Dwarfs escaped in the great battles and lived on, shaving their beards and wearing high-heeled shoes and pretending to be men. They have mixed with your Telmarines. I am one of those, only a half-Dwarf, and if any of my kindred, the true Dwarfs, are still alive anywhere in the world, doubtless they would despise me and call me a traitor. But never in all these years have we forgotten our own people and all the other happy creatures of Narnia, and the long-lost days of freedom.”

“I'm—I'm sorry, Doctor,” said Caspian. “It wasn't my fault, you know.”

“I am not saying these things in blame of you, dear Prince,” answered the Doctor. “You may well ask why I say them at all. But I have two reasons. Firstly, because my old heart has carried these secret memories so long that it aches with them and would burst if I did not whisper them to you. But secondly, for this: that when you become King you may help us, for I know that you also, Telmarine though you are, love the Old Things.”

“I do, I do,” said Caspian. “But how can I help?”

“You can be kind to the poor remnants of the Dwarf people, like myself. You can gather learned magicians and try to find a way of awaking the trees once more. You can search through all the nooks and wild places of the land to see if any Fauns or Talking Beasts or Dwarfs are perhaps still alive in hiding.”

“Do you think there are any?” asked Caspian eagerly.

“I don't know—I don't know,” said the Doctor with a deep sigh. “Sometimes I am afraid there can't be. I have been looking for traces of them all my life. Sometimes I have thought I heard a Dwarf-drum in the mountains. Sometimes at night, in the woods, I thought I had caught a glimpse of Fauns and Satyrs dancing a long way off; but when I came to the place, there was never anything there. I have often despaired; but something always happens to start me hoping again. I don't know. But at least you can try to be a King like the High King Peter of old, and not like your uncle.”

“Then it's true about the Kings and Queens too, and about the White Witch?” said Caspian.

“Certainly it is true,” said Cornelius. “Their reign was the Golden Age in Narnia and the land has never forgotten them.”

“Did they live in this castle, Doctor?”

“Nay, my dear,” said the old man. “This castle is a thing of yesterday. Your great-great-grandfather built it. But when the two sons of Adam and the two daughters of Eve were made Kings and Queens of Narnia by Aslan himself, they lived in the castle of Cair Paravel. No man alive has seen that blessed place and perhaps even the ruins of it have now vanished. But we believe it was far from here, down at the mouth of the Great River, on the very shore of the sea.”

“Ugh!” said Caspian with a shudder. “Do you mean in the Black Woods? Where all the—the—you know, the ghosts live?”

“Your Highness speaks as you have been taught,” said the Doctor. “But it is all lies. There are no ghosts there. That is a story invented by the Telmarines. Your Kings are in deadly fear of the sea because they can never quite forget that in all stories Aslan comes from over the sea. They don't want to go near it and they don't want anyone else to go near it. So they have let great woods grow up to cut their people off from the coast. But because they have quarrelled with the trees they are afraid of the woods. And because they are afraid of the woods they imagine that they are full of ghosts. And the Kings and great men, hating both the sea and the wood, partly believe these stories, and partly encourage them. They feel safer if no one in Narnia dares to go down to the coast and look out to sea—towards Aslan's land and the morning and the eastern end of the world.”

There was a deep silence between them for a few minutes. Then Doctor Cornelius said, “Come. We have been here long enough. It is time to go down and to bed.”

“Must we?” said Caspian. “I'd like to go on talking about these things for hours and hours and hours.”

“Someone might begin looking for us, if we did that,” said Doctor Cornelius.





CHAPTER 5　CASPIAN'S ADVENTURE IN THE MOUNTAINS


AFTER this, Caspian and his Tutor had many more secret conversations on the top of the Great Tower, and at each conversation Caspian learned more about Old Narnia, so that thinking and dreaming about the old days, and longing that they might come back, filled nearly all his spare hours. But of course he had not many hours to spare, for now his education was beginning in earnest. He learned sword-fighting and riding, swimming and diving, how to shoot with the bow and play on the recorder and the theorbo, how to hunt the stag and cut him up when he was dead, besides Cosmography, Rhetoric, Heraldry, Versification, and of course History, with a little Law, Physic, Alchemy, and Astronomy. Of Magic he learned only the theory, for Doctor Cornelius said the practical part was not a proper study for princes. “And I myself,” he added, “am only a very imperfect magician and can do only the smallest experiments.” Of Navigation (“Which is a noble and heroical art,” said the Doctor) he was taught nothing, because King Miraz disapproved of ships and the sea.

He also learned a great deal by using his own eyes and ears. As a little boy he had often wondered why he disliked his aunt, Queen Prunaprismia; he now saw that it was because she disliked him. He also began to see that Narnia was an unhappy country. The taxes were high and the laws were stern and Miraz was a cruel man.

After some years there came a time when the Queen seemed to be ill and there was a great deal of bustle and pother about her in the castle and doctors came and the courtiers whispered. This was in early summertime. And one night, while all this fuss was going on, Caspian was unexpectedly wakened by Doctor Cornelius after he had been only a few hours in bed.

“Are we going to do a little Astronomy, Doctor?” said Caspian.

“Hush!” said the Doctor. “Trust me and do exactly as I tell you. Put on all your clothes; you have a long journey before you.”

Caspian was very surprised, but he had learned to have confidence in his Tutor and he began doing what he was told at once. When he was dressed the Doctor said, “I have a wallet for you. We must go into the next room and fill it with victuals from your Highness's supper table.”

“My gentlemen-in-waiting will be there,” said Caspian.

“They are fast asleep and will not wake,” said the Doctor. “I am a very minor magician but I can at least contrive a charmed sleep.”

They went into the antechamber and there, sure enough, the two gentlemen-in-waiting were, sprawling on chairs and snoring hard. Doctor Cornelius quickly cut up the remains of a cold chicken and some slices of venison and put them, with bread and an apple or so and a little flask of good wine, into the wallet which he then gave to Caspian. It fitted on by a strap over Caspian's shoulder, like a satchel you would use for taking books to school.

“Have you your sword?” asked the Doctor.

“Yes,” said Caspian.

“Then put this mantle over all to hide the sword and the wallet. That's right. And now we must go to the Great Tower and talk.”

When they had reached the top of the tower (it was a cloudy night, not at all like the night when they had seen the conjunction of Tarva and Alambil) Doctor Cornelius said,

“Dear Prince, you must leave this castle at once and go to seek your fortune in the wide world. Your life is in danger here.”

“Why?” asked Caspian.

“Because you are the true King of Narnia: Caspian the Tenth, the true son and heir of Caspian the Ninth. Long life to your Majesty”—and suddenly, to Caspian's great surprise, the little man dropped down on one knee and kissed his hand.

“What does it all mean? I don't understand,” said Caspian.

“I wonder you have never asked me before,” said the Doctor, “why, being the son of King Caspian, you are not King Caspian yourself. Everyone except your Majesty knows that Miraz is a usurper. When he first began to rule he did not even pretend to be the King: he called himself Lord Protector. But then your royal mother died, the good Queen and the only Telmarine who was ever kind to me. And then, one by one, all the great lords, who had known your father, died or disappeared. Not by accident, either. Miraz weeded them out. Belisar and Uvilas were shot with arrows on a hunting party: by chance, it was pretended. All the great house of the Passarids he sent to fight giants on the northern frontier till one by one they fell. Arlian and Erimon and a dozen more he executed for treason on a false charge. The two brothers of Beaversdam he shut up as madmen. And finally he persuaded the seven noble lords, who alone among all the Telmarines did not fear the sea, to sail away and look for new lands beyond the Eastern Ocean, and, as he intended, they never came back. And when there was no one left who could speak a word for you, then his flatterers (as he had instructed them) begged him to become King. And of course he did.”

“Do you mean he now wants to kill me too?” said Caspian.

“That is almost certain,” said Doctor Cornelius.

“But why now?” said Caspian. “I mean, why didn't he do it long ago if he wanted to? And what harm have I done him?”

“He has changed his mind about you because of something that happened only two hours ago. The Queen has had a son.”

“I don't see what that's got to do with it,” said Caspian.

“Don't see!” exclaimed the Doctor. “Have all my lessons in History and Politics taught you no more than that? Listen. As long as he had no children of his own, he was willing enough that you should be King after he died. He may not have cared much about you, but he would rather you should have the throne than a stranger. Now that he has a son of his own he will want his own son to be the next King. You are in the way. He'll clear you out of the way.”

“Is he really as bad as that?” said Caspian. “Would he really murder me?”

“He murdered your Father,” said Doctor Cornelius.

Caspian felt very queer and said nothing.

“I can tell you the whole story,” said the Doctor. “But not now. There is no time. You must fly at once.”

“You'll come with me?” said Caspian.

“I dare not,” said the Doctor. “It would make your danger greater. Two are more easily tracked than one. Dear Prince, dear King Caspian, you must be very brave. You must go alone and at once. Try to get across the southern border to the court of King Nain of Archenland. He will be good to you.”

“Shall I never see you again?” said Caspian in a quavering voice.

“I hope so, dear King,” said the Doctor. “What friend have I in the wide world except your Majesty? And I have a little magic. But in the meantime, speed is everything. Here are two gifts before you go. This is a little purse of gold—alas, all the treasure in this castle should be your own by rights. And here is something far better.”

He put in Caspian's hands something which he could hardly see but which he knew by the feel to be a horn.

“That,” said Doctor Cornelius, “is the greatest and most sacred treasure of Narnia. Many terrors I endured, many spells did I utter, to find it, when I was still young. It is the magic horn of Queen Susan herself which she left behind her when she vanished from Narnia at the end of the Golden Age. It is said that whoever blows it shall have strange help—no one can say how strange. It may have power to call Queen Lucy and King Edmund and Queen Susan and the High King Peter back from the past, and they will set all to rights. It may be that it will call up Aslan himself. Take it, King Caspian: but do not use it except at your greatest need. And now, haste, haste, haste. The little door at the very bottom of the Tower, the door into the garden, is unlocked. There we must part.”

“Can't I get my horse Destrier?” said Caspian.

“He is already saddled and waiting for you just at the corner of the orchard.”

During the long climb down the winding staircase Cornelius whispered many more words of direction and advice. Caspian's heart was sinking, but he tried to take it all in. Then came the fresh air in the garden, a fervent handclasp with the Doctor, a run across the lawn, a welcoming whinny from Destrier, and so King Caspian the Tenth left the castle of his fathers. Looking back, he saw fireworks going up to celebrate the birth of the new prince.

All night he rode southward, choosing by-ways and bridle paths through woods as long as he was in country that he knew; but afterwards he kept to the high road. Destrier was as excited as his master at this unusual journey, and Caspian, though tears had come into his eyes at saying good-bye to Doctor Cornelius, felt brave and, in a way, happy, to think that he was King Caspian riding to seek adventures, with his sword on his left hip and Queen Susan's magic horn on his right. But when day came, with a sprinkle of rain, and he looked about him and saw on every side unknown woods, wild heaths, and blue mountains, he thought how large and strange the world was and felt frightened and small.

As soon as it was full daylight he left the road and found an open grassy place amid a wood where he could rest. He took off Destrier's bridle and let him graze, ate some cold chicken and drank a little wine, and presently fell asleep. It was late afternoon when he awoke. He ate a morsel and continued his journey, still southward, by many unfrequented lanes. He was now in a land of hills, going up and down, but always more up than down. From every ridge he could see the mountains growing bigger and blacker ahead. As the evening closed in, he was riding their lower slopes. The wind rose. Soon rain fell in torrents. Destrier became uneasy; there was thunder in the air. And now they entered a dark and seemingly endless pine forest, and all the stories Caspian had ever heard of trees being unfriendly to Man crowded into his mind. He remembered that he was, after all, a Telmarine, one of the race who cut down trees wherever they could and were at war with all wild things; and though he himself might be unlike other Telmarines, the trees could not be expected to know this.

Nor did they. The wind became a tempest, the woods roared and creaked all round him. There came a crash. A tree fell right across the road just behind him. “Quiet, Destrier, quiet!” said Caspian, patting his horse's neck; but he was trembling himself and knew that he had escaped death by an inch. Lightning flashed and a great crack of thunder seemed to break the sky in two just overhead. Destrier bolted in good earnest. Caspian was a good rider, but he had not the strength to hold him back. He kept his seat, but he knew that his life hung by a thread during the wild career that followed. Tree after tree rose up before them in the dusk and was only just avoided. Then, almost too suddenly to hurt (and yet it did hurt him too) something struck Caspian on the forehead and he knew no more.




When he came to himself he was lying in a firelit place with bruised limbs and a bad headache. Low voices were speaking close at hand.

“And now,” said one, “before it wakes up we must decide what to do with it.”

“Kill it,” said another. “We can't let it live. It would betray us.”

“We ought to have killed it at once, or else let it alone,” said a third voice. “We can't kill it now. Not after we've taken it in and bandaged its head and all. It would be murdering a guest.”

“Gentlemen,” said Caspian in a feeble voice, “whatever you do to me, I hope you will be kind to my poor horse.”

“Your horse had taken flight long before we found you,” said the first voice—a curiously husky, earthy voice, as Caspian now noticed.

“Now don't let it talk you round with its pretty words,” said the second voice. “I still say—”

“Horns and halibuts!” exclaimed the third voice. “Of course we're not going to murder it. For shame, Nikabrik. What do you say, Trufflehunter? What shall we do with it?”

“I shall give it a drink,” said the first voice, presumably Trufflehunter's. A dark shape approached the bed. Caspian felt an arm slipped gently under his shoulders—if it was exactly an arm. The shape somehow seemed wrong. The face that bent towards him seemed wrong too. He got the impression that it was very hairy and very long nosed, and there were odd white patches on each side of it. “It's a mask of some sort,” thought Caspian. “Or perhaps I'm in a fever and imagining it all.” A cupful of something sweet and hot was set to his lips and he drank. At that moment one of the others poked the fire. A blaze sprang up and Caspian almost screamed with the shock as the sudden light revealed the face that was looking into his own. It was not a man's face but a badger's, though larger and friendlier and more intelligent than the face of any badger he had seen before. And it had certainly been talking. He saw, too, that he was on a bed of heather, in a cave. By the fire sat two little bearded men, so much wilder and shorter and hairier and thicker than Doctor Cornelius that he knew them at once for real Dwarfs, ancient Dwarfs with not a drop of human blood in their veins. And Caspian knew that he had found the Old Narnians at last. Then his head began to swim again.

In the next few days he learned to know them by names. The Badger was called Trufflehunter; he was the oldest and kindest of the three. The Dwarf who had wanted to kill Caspian was a sour Black Dwarf (that is, his hair and beard were black, and thick and hard like horse-hair). His name was Nikabrik. The other Dwarf was a Red Dwarf with hair rather like a Fox's and he was called Trumpkin.

“And now,” said Nikabrik on the first evening when Caspian was well enough to sit up and talk, “we still have to decide what to do with this Human. You two think you've done it a great kindness by not letting me kill it. But I suppose the upshot is that we have to keep it a prisoner for life. I'm certainly not going to let it go alive—to go back to its own kind and betray us all.”

“Bulbs and bolsters! Nikabrik,” said Trumpkin. “Why need you talk so unhandsomely? It isn't the creature's fault that it bashed its head against a tree outside our hole. And I don't think it looks like a traitor.”

“I say,” said Caspian, “you haven't yet found out whether I want to go back. I don't. I want to stay with you—if you'll let me. I've been looking for people like you all my life.”

“That's a likely story,” growled Nikabrik. “You're a Telmarine and a Human, aren't you? Of course you want to go back to your own kind.”

“Well, even if I did, I couldn't,” said Caspian. “I was flying for my life when I had my accident. The King wants to kill me. If you'd killed me, you'd have done the very thing to please him.”

“Well now,” said Trufflehunter, “you don't say so!”

“Eh?” said Trumpkin. “What's that? What have you been doing, Human, to fall foul of Miraz at your age?”

“He's my uncle,” began Caspian, when Nikabrik jumped up with his hand on his dagger.

“There you are!” he cried. “Not only a Telmarine but close kin and heir to our greatest enemy. Are you still mad enough to let this creature live?” He would have stabbed Caspian then and there, if the Badger and Trumpkin had not got in the way and forced him back to his seat and held him down.

“Now, once and for all, Nikabrik,” said Trumpkin. “Will you contain yourself, or must Trufflehunter and I sit on your head?”

Nikabrik sulkily promised to behave, and the other two asked Caspian to tell his whole story. When he had done so there was a moment's silence.

“This is the queerest thing I ever heard,” said Trumpkin.

“I don't like it,” said Nikabrik. “I didn't know there were stories about us still told among the Humans. The less they know about us the better. That old nurse, now. She'd better have held her tongue. And it's all mixed up with that Tutor: a renegade Dwarf. I hate 'em. I hate 'em worse than the Humans. You mark my words—no good will come of it.”

“Don't you go talking about things you don't understand, Nikabrik,” said Trufflehunter. “You Dwarfs are as forgetful and changeable as the Humans themselves. I'm a beast, I am, and a Badger what's more. We don't change. We hold on. I say great good will come of it. This is the true King of Narnia we've got here: a true King, coming back to true Narnia. And we beasts remember, even if Dwarfs forget, that Narnia was never right except when a son of Adam was King.”

“Whistles and whirligigs! Trufflehunter,” said Trumpkin. “You don't mean you want to give the country to Humans?”

“I said nothing about that,” answered the Badger. “It's not Men's country (who should know that better than me?) but it's a country for a man to be King of. We badgers have long enough memories to know that. Why, bless us all, wasn't the High King Peter a Man?”

“Do you believe all those old stories?” asked Trumpkin.

“I tell you, we don't change, we beasts,” said Trufflehunter. “We don't forget. I believe in the High King Peter and the rest that reigned at Cair Paravel, as firmly as I believe in Aslan himself.”

“As firmly as that, I dare say,” said Trumpkin. “But who believes in Aslan nowadays?”

“I do,” said Caspian. “And if I hadn't believed in him before, I would now. Back there among the Humans the people who laughed at Aslan would have laughed at stories about Talking Beasts and Dwarfs. Sometimes I did wonder if there really was such a person as Aslan: but then sometimes I wondered if there were really people like you. Yet there you are.”

“That's right,” said Trufflehunter. “You're right, King Caspian. And as long as you will be true to Old Narnia you shall be my King, whatever they say. Long life to your Majesty.”

“You make me sick, Badger,” growled Nikabrik. “The High King Peter and the rest may have been Men, but they were a different sort of Men. This is one of the cursed Telmarines. He has hunted beasts for sport. Haven't you, now?” he added, rounding suddenly on Caspian.

“Well, to tell you the truth, I have,” said Caspian. “But they weren't Talking Beasts.”

“It's all the same thing,” said Nikabrik.

“No, no, no,” said Trufflehunter. “You know it isn't. You know very well that the beasts in Narnia nowadays are different and are no more than the poor dumb, witless creatures you'd find in Kalormen or Telmar. They're smaller too. They're far more different from us than the half-Dwarfs are from you.”

There was a great deal more talk, but it all ended with the agreement that Caspian should stay and even the promise that, as soon as he was able to go out, he should be taken to see what Trumpkin called “the Others”; for apparently in these wild parts all sorts of creatures from the Old Days of Narnia still lived on in hiding.





CHAPTER 6　THE PEOPLE THAT LIVED IN HIDING


NOW began the happiest times that Caspian had ever known. On a fine summer morning when the dew lay on the grass he set off with the Badger and the two Dwarfs, up through the forest to a high saddle in the mountains and down on to their sunny southern slopes where one looked across the green wolds of Archenland.

“We will go first to the Three Bulgy Bears,” said Trumpkin.

They came in a glade to an old hollow oak tree covered with moss, and Trufflehunter tapped with his paw three times on the trunk and there was no answer. Then he tapped again and a woolly sort of voice from inside said, “Go away. It's not time to get up yet.” But when he tapped the third time there was a noise like a small earthquake from inside and a sort of door opened and out came three brown bears, very bulgy indeed and blinking their little eyes. And when everything had been explained to them (which took a long time because they were so sleepy) they said, just as Trufflehunter had said, that a son of Adam ought to be King of Narnia and all kissed Caspian—very wet, snuffly kisses they were—and offered him some honey. Caspian did not really want honey, without bread, at that time in the morning, but he thought it polite to accept. It took him a long time afterwards to get unsticky.

After that they went on till they came among tall beech trees and Trufflehunter called out, “Pattertwig! Pattertwig! Pattertwig!” and almost at once, bounding down from branch to branch till he was just above their heads, came the most magnificent red squirrel that Caspian had ever seen. He was far bigger than the ordinary dumb squirrels which he had sometimes seen in the castle gardens; indeed he was nearly the size of a terrier and the moment you looked in his face you saw that he could talk. Indeed the difficulty was to get him to stop talking, for, like all squirrels, he was a chatterer. He welcomed Caspian at once and asked if he would like a nut and Caspian said thanks, he would. But as Pattertwig went bounding away to fetch it, Trufflehunter whispered in Caspian's ear, “Don't look. Look the other way. It's very bad manners among squirrels to watch anyone going to his store or to look as if you wanted to know where it was.” Then Pattertwig came back with the nut and Caspian ate it and after that Pattertwig asked if he could take any messages to other friends. “For I can go nearly everywhere without setting foot to ground,” he said. Trufflehunter and the Dwarfs thought this a very good idea and gave Pattertwig messages to all sorts of people with queer names telling them all to come to a feast and council on Dancing Lawn at midnight three nights ahead. “And you'd better tell the three Bulgies too,” added Trumpkin. “We forgot to mention it to them.”

Their next visit was to the Seven Brothers of Shuddering Wood. Trumpkin led the way back to the saddle and then down eastward on the northern slope of the mountains till they came to a very solemn place among rocks and fir trees. They went very quietly and presently Caspian could feel the ground shake under his feet as if someone were hammering down below. Trumpkin went to a flat stone about the size of the top of a water-butt, and stamped on it with his foot. After a long pause it was moved away by someone or something underneath, and there was a dark, round hole with a good deal of heat and steam coming out of it and in the middle of the hole the head of a Dwarf very like Trumpkin himself. There was a long talk here and the dwarf seemed more suspicious than the Squirrel or the Bulgy Bears had been, but in the end the whole party were invited to come down. Caspian found himself descending a dark stairway into the earth, but when he came to the bottom he saw firelight. It was the light of a furnace. The whole place was a smithy. A subterranean stream ran past on one side of it. Two Dwarfs were at the bellows, another was holding a piece of red-hot metal on the anvil with a pair of tongs, a fourth was hammering it, and two, wiping their horny little hands on a greasy cloth, were coming forward to meet the visitors. It took some time to satisfy them that Caspian was a friend and not an enemy, but when they did, they all cried— “Long live the King,” and their gifts were noble—mail shirts and helmets and swords for Caspian and Trumpkin and Nikabrik. The Badger could have had the same if he had liked, but he said he was a beast, he was, and if his claws and teeth could not keep his skin whole, it wasn't worth keeping. The workmanship of the arms was far finer than any Caspian had ever seen, and he gladly accepted the Dwarf-made sword instead of his own, which looked, in comparison, as feeble as a toy and as clumsy as a stick. The seven brothers (who were all Red Dwarfs) promised to come to the feast at Dancing Lawn.

A little farther on, in a dry, rocky ravine they reached the cave of five Black Dwarfs. They looked suspiciously at Caspian, but in the end the eldest of them said, “If he is against Miraz, we'll have him for King.” And the next oldest said, “Shall we go farther up for you, up to the crags? There's an Ogre or two and a Hag that we could introduce you to, up there.”

“Certainly not,” said Caspian.

“I should think not, indeed,” said Trufflehunter. “We want none of that sort on our side.” Nikabrik disagreed with this, but Trumpkin and the Badger overruled him. It gave Caspian a shock to realize that the horrible creatures out of the old stories, as well as the nice ones, had some descendants in Narnia still.

“We should not have Aslan for our friend if we brought in that rabble,” said Trufflehunter as they came away from the cave of the Black Dwarfs.

“Oh, Aslan!” said Trumpkin, cheerily but contemptuously. “What matters much more is that you wouldn't have me.”

“Do you believe in Aslan?” said Caspian to Nikabrik.

“I'll believe in anyone or anything,” said Nikabrik, “that'll batter these cursed Telmarine barbarians to pieces or drive them out of Narnia. Anyone or anything, Aslan or the White Witch, do you understand?”

“Silence, silence,” said Trufflehunter. “You do not know what you are saying. She was a worse enemy than Miraz and all his race.”

“Not to Dwarfs, she wasn't,” said Nikabrik.

Their next visit was a pleasanter one. As they came lower down, the mountains opened out into a great glen or wooded gorge with a swift river running at the bottom. The open places near the river's edge were a mass of foxgloves and wild roses and the air was buzzing with bees. Here Trufflehunter called again, “Glenstorm! Glenstorm!” and after a pause Caspian heard the sound of hoofs. It grew louder till the valley trembled and at last, breaking and trampling the thickets, there came in sight the noblest creatures that Caspian had yet seen, the great Centaur Glenstorm and his three sons. His flanks were glossy chestnut and the beard that covered his broad chest was golden-red. He was a prophet and a star-gazer and knew what they had come about.

“Long live the King,” he cried. “I and my sons are ready for war. When is the battle to be joined?”

Up till now neither Caspian nor the others had really been thinking of a war. They had some vague idea, perhaps, of an occasional raid on some Human farmstead or of attacking a party of hunters, if it ventured too far into these southern wilds. But, in the main, they had thought only of living to themselves in woods and caves and building up an attempt at Old Narnia in hiding. As soon as Glenstorm had spoken everyone felt much more serious.

“Do you mean a real war to drive Miraz out of Narnia?” asked Caspian.

“What else?” said the Centaur. “Why else does your Majesty go clad in mail and girt with sword?”

“Is it possible, Glenstorm?” said the Badger.

“The time is ripe,” said Glenstorm. “I watch the skies, Badger, for it is mine to watch, as it is yours to remember. Tarva and Alambil have met in the halls of high heaven, and on earth a son of Adam has once more arisen to rule and name the creatures. The hour has struck. Our council at the Dancing Lawn must be a council of war.” He spoke in such a voice that neither Caspian nor the others hesitated for a moment: it now seemed to them quite possible that they might win a war and quite certain that they must wage one.

As it was now past the middle of the day, they rested with the Centaurs and ate such food as the Centaurs provided—cakes of oaten meal, and apples, and herbs, and wine, and cheese.

The next place they were to visit was quite near at hand, but they had to go a long way round in order to avoid a region in which Men lived. It was well into the afternoon before they found themselves in level fields, warm between hedgerows. There Trufflehunter called at the mouth of a little hole in a green bank and out popped the last thing Caspian expected—a Talking Mouse. He was of course bigger than a common mouse, well over a foot high when he stood on his hind legs, and with ears nearly as long as (though broader than) a rabbit's. His name was Reepicheep and he was a gay and martial mouse. He wore a tiny little rapier at his side and twirled his long whiskers as if they were a moustache. “There are twelve of us, Sire,” he said with a dashing and graceful bow, “and I place all the resources of my people unreservedly at your Majesty's disposal.” Caspian tried hard (and unsuccessfully) not to laugh, but he couldn't help thinking that Reepicheep and all his people could very easily be put in a washing basket and carried home on one's back.

It would take too long to mention all the creatures whom Caspian met that day—Clodsley Shovel the Mole, the three Hardbiters (who were badgers like Trufflehunter), Camillo the Hare, and Hogglestock the Hedgehog. They rested at last beside a well at the edge of a wide and level circle of grass, bordered with tall elms which now threw long shadows across it, for the sun was setting, the daisies closing, and the rooks flying home to bed. Here they supped on food they had brought with them and Trumpkin lit his pipe (Nikabrik was not a smoker).

“Now,” said the Badger, “if only we could wake the spirits of these trees and this well, we should have done a good day's work.”

“Can't we?” said Caspian.

“No,” said Trufflehunter. “We have no power over them. Since the Humans came into the land, felling forests and defiling streams, the Dryads and Naiads have sunk into a deep sleep. Who knows if ever they will stir again? And that is a great loss to our side. The Telmarines are horribly afraid of the woods, and once the Trees moved in anger, our enemies would go mad with fright and be chased out of Narnia as quick as their legs could carry them.”

“What imaginations you Animals have!” said Trumpkin, who didn't believe in such things. “But why stop at Trees and Waters? Wouldn't it be even nicer if the stones started throwing themselves at old Miraz?”

The Badger only grunted at this, and after that there was such a silence that Caspian had nearly dropped off to sleep when he thought he heard a faint musical sound from the depth of the woods at his back. Then he thought it was only a dream and turned over again; but as soon as his ear touched the ground he felt or heard (it was hard to tell which) a faint beating or drumming. He raised his head. The beating noise at once became fainter, but the music returned, clearer this time. It was like flutes. He saw that Trufflehunter was sitting up staring into the wood. The moon was bright; Caspian had been asleep longer than he thought. Nearer and nearer came the music, a tune wild and yet dreamy, and the noise of many light feet, till at last, out from the wood into the moonlight, came dancing shapes such as Caspian had been thinking of all his life. They were not much taller than Dwarfs, but far slighter and more graceful. Their curly heads had little horns, the upper part of their bodies gleamed naked in the pale light, but their legs and feet were those of goats.

“Fauns!” cried Caspian, jumping up, and in a moment they were all round him. It took next to no time to explain the whole situation to them and they accepted Caspian at once. Before he knew what he was doing he found himself joining in the dance. Trumpkin, with heavier and jerkier movements, did likewise and even Trufflehunter hopped and lumbered about as best he could. Only Nikabrik stayed where he was, looking on in silence. The Fauns footed it all round Caspian to their reedy pipes. Their strange faces, which seemed mournful and merry all at once, looked into his; dozens of Fauns, Mentius and Obentinus and Dumnus, Voluns, Voltinus, Girbius, Nimienus, Nausus and Oscuns. Pattertwig had sent them all.

When Caspian awoke next morning he could hardly believe that it had not all been a dream; but the grass was covered with little cloven hoof-marks.





CHAPTER 7　OLD NARNIA IN DANGER


THE place where they had met the Fauns was, of course, Dancing Lawn itself, and here Caspian and his friends remained till the night of the great Council. To sleep under the stars, to drink nothing but well water and to live chiefly on nuts and wild fruit, was a strange experience for Caspian after his bed with silken sheets in a tapestried chamber at the castle, with meals laid out on gold and silver dishes in the anteroom, and attendants ready at his call. But he had never enjoyed himself more. Never had sleep been more refreshing nor food tasted more savoury, and he began already to harden and his face wore a kinglier look.

When the great night came, and his various strange subjects came stealing into the lawn by ones and twos and threes or by sixes and sevens—the moon then shining almost at her full—his heart swelled as he saw their numbers and heard their greetings. All whom he had met were there: Bulgy Bears and Red Dwarfs and Black Dwarfs, Moles and Badgers, Hares and Hedgehogs, and others whom he had not yet seen— five Satyrs as red as foxes, the whole contingent of Talking Mice, armed to the teeth and following a shrill trumpet, some Owls, the Old Raven of Ravenscaur. Last of all (and this took Caspian's breath away), with the Centaurs came a small but genuine Giant, Wimbleweather of Deadman's Hill, carrying on his back a basketful of rather sea-sick Dwarfs who had accepted his offer of a lift and were now wishing they had walked instead.

The Bulgy Bears were very anxious to have the feast first and leave the council till afterwards: perhaps till tomorrow. Reepicheep and his Mice said that councils and feasts could both wait, and proposed storming Miraz in his own castle that very night. Pattertwig and the other Squirrels said they could talk and eat at the same time, so why not have the council and feast all at once? The Moles proposed throwing up entrenchments round the Lawn before they did anything else. The Fauns thought it would be better to begin with a solemn dance. The Old Raven, while agreeing with the Bears that it would take too long to have a full council before supper, begged to be allowed to give a brief address to the whole company. But Caspian and the Centaurs and the Dwarfs over-ruled all these suggestions and insisted on holding a real council of war at once.

When all the other creatures had been persuaded to sit down quietly in a great circle, and when (with more difficulty) they had got Pattertwig to stop running to and fro and saying “Silence! Silence, everyone, for the King's speech,” Caspian, feeling a little nervous, got up. “Narnians!” he began, but he never got any further, for at that very moment Camillo the Hare said, “Hush! There's a Man somewhere near.”

They were all creatures of the wild, accustomed to being hunted, and they all became still as statues. The beasts all turned their noses in the direction which Camillo had indicated.

“Smells like Man and yet not quite like Man,” whispered Trufflehunter.

“It's getting steadily nearer,” said Camillo.

“Two badgers and you three Dwarfs, with your bow at the ready, go softly off to meet it,” said Caspian.

“We'll settle 'un,” said a Black Dwarf grimly, fitting a shaft to his bowstring.

“Don't shoot if it is alone,” said Caspian. “Catch it.”

“Why?” asked the Dwarf.

“Do as you're told,” said Glenstorm the Centaur.

Everyone waited in silence while the three Dwarfs and two Badgers trotted stealthily across to the trees on the north-west side of the Lawn. Then came a sharp dwarfish cry, “Stop! Who goes there?” and a sudden spring. A moment later a voice, which Caspian knew well, could be heard saying, “All right, all right, I'm unarmed. Take my wrists if you like, worthy Badgers, but don't bite right through them. I want to speak to the King.”

“Doctor Cornelius!” cried Caspian with joy, and rushed forward to greet his old master. Everyone else crowded round.

“Pah!” said Nikabrik. “A renegade Dwarf. A half-and-halfer! Shall I pass my sword through its throat?”

“Be quiet, Nikabrik,” said Trumpkin. “The creature can't help its ancestry.”

“This is my greatest friend and the saviour of my life,” said Caspian. “And anyone who doesn't like his company may leave my army: at once. Dearest Doctor, I am glad to see you again. How ever did you find us out?”

“By a little use of simple magic, your Majesty,” said the Doctor, who was still puffing and blowing from having walked so fast. “But there's no time to go into that now. We must all fly from this place at once. You are already betrayed and Miraz is on the move. Before mid-day tomorrow you will be surrounded.”

“Betrayed!” said Caspian. “And by whom?”

“Another renegade Dwarf, no doubt,” said Nikabrik.

“By your horse Destrier,” said Doctor Cornelius. “The poor brute knew no better. When you were knocked off, of course, he went dawdling back to his stable in the castle. Then the secret of your flight was known. I made myself scarce, having no wish to be questioned about it in Miraz's torture chamber. I had a pretty good guess from my crystal as to where I should find you. But all day—that was the day before yesterday—I saw Miraz's tracking parties out in the woods. Yesterday I learned that his army is out. I don't think some of your—um—pure-blooded Dwarfs have as much woodcraft as might be expected. You've left tracks all over the place. Great carelessness. At any rate something has warned Miraz that Old Narnia is not so dead as he had hoped, and he is on the move.”

“Hurrah!” said a very shrill and small voice from somewhere at the Doctor's feet. “Let them come! All I ask is that the King will put me and my people in the front.”

“What on earth?” said Doctor Cornelius. “Has your Majesty got grasshoppers—or mosquitoes—in your army?” Then after stooping down and peering carefully through his spectacles, he broke into a laugh.

“By the Lion,” he swore, “it's a mouse. Signior Mouse, I desire your better acquaintance. I am honoured by meeting so valiant a beast.”

“My friendship you shall have, learned Man,” piped Reepicheep. “And any Dwarf—or Giant—in the army who does not give you good language shall have my sword to reckon with.”

“Is there time for this foolery?” asked Nikabrik. “What are our plans? Battle or flight?”

“Battle if need be,” said Trumpkin. “But we are hardly ready for it yet, and this is no very defensible place.”

“I don't like the idea of running away,” said Caspian.

“Hear him! Hear him!” said the Bulgy Bears. “Whatever we do, don't let's have any running. Especially not before supper; and not too soon after it neither.”

“Those who run first do not always run last,” said the Centaur. “And should we let the enemy choose our position instead of choosing it ourselves? Let us find a strong place.”

“That's wise, your Majesty, that's wise,” said Trufflehunter.

“But where are we to go?” asked several voices.

“Your Majesty,” said Doctor Cornelius, “and all you variety of creatures, I think we must fly east and down the river to the great woods. The Telmarines hate that region. They have always been afraid of the sea and of something that may come over the sea. That is why they have let the great woods grow up. If traditions speak true, the ancient Cair Paravel was at the river-mouth. All that part is friendly to us and hateful to our enemies. We must go to Aslan's How.”

“Aslan's How?” said several voices. “We do not know what it is.”

“It lies within the skirts of the Great Woods and it is a huge mound which Narnians raised in very ancient times over a very magical place, where there stood—and perhaps still stands—a very magical Stone. The Mound is all hollowed out within into galleries and caves, and the Stone is in the central cave of all. There is room in the mound for all our stores, and those of us who have most need of cover and are most accustomed to underground life can be lodged in the caves. The rest of us can lie in the wood. At a pinch all of us (except this worthy Giant) could retreat into the Mound itself, and there we should be beyond the reach of every danger except famine.”

“It is a good thing we have a learned man among us,” said Trufflehunter; but Trumpkin muttered under his breath, “Soup and celery! I wish our leaders would think less about these old wives' tales and more about victuals and arms.” But all approved of Cornelius's proposal and that very night, half an hour later, they were on the march. Before sunrise they arrived at Aslan's How.

It was certainly an awesome place, a round green hill on top of another hill, long since grown over with trees, and one little, low doorway leading into it. The tunnels inside were a perfect maze till you got to know them, and they were lined and roofed with smooth stones, and on the stones, peering in the twilight, Caspian saw strange characters and snaky patterns, and pictures in which the form of a Lion was repeated again and again. It all seemed to belong to an even older Narnia than the Narnia of which his nurse had told him.

It was after they had taken up their quarters in and around the How that fortune began to turn against them. King Miraz's scouts soon found their new lair, and he and his army arrived on the edge of the woods. And as so often happens, the enemy turned out stronger than they had reckoned. Caspian's heart sank as he saw company after company arriving. And though Miraz's men may have been afraid of going into the wood, they were even more afraid of Miraz, and with him in command they carried battle deeply into it and sometimes almost to the How itself. Caspian and other captains of course made many sorties into the open country. Thus there was fighting on most days and sometimes by night as well; but Caspian's party had on the whole the worst of it.

At last there came a night when everything had gone as badly as possible, and the rain which had been falling heavily all day had ceased at nightfall only to give place to raw cold. That morning Caspian had arranged what was his biggest battle yet, and all had hung their hopes on it. He, with most of the Dwarfs, was to have fallen on the King's right wing at daybreak, and then, when they were heavily engaged, Giant Wimbleweather, with the Centaurs and some of the fiercest beasts, was to have broken out from another place and endeavoured to cut the King's right off from the rest of the army. But it had all failed. No one had warned Caspian (because no one in these later days of Narnia remembered) that Giants are not at all clever. Poor Wimbleweather, though as brave as a lion, was a true Giant in that respect. He had broken out at the wrong time and from the wrong place, and both his party and Caspian's had suffered badly and done the enemy little harm. The best of the Bears had been hurt, a Centaur terribly wounded, and there were few in Caspian's party who had not lost blood. It was a gloomy company that huddled under the dripping trees to eat their scanty supper.

The gloomiest of all was Giant Wimbleweather. He knew it was all his fault. He sat in silence shedding big tears which collected on the end of his nose and then fell off with a huge splash on the whole bivouac of the Mice, who had just been beginning to get warm and drowsy. They all jumped up, shaking the water out of their ears and wringing their little blankets, and asked the Giant in shrill but forcible voices whether he thought they weren't wet enough without this sort of thing. And then other people woke up and told the Mice they had been enrolled as scouts and not as a concert party, and asked why they couldn't keep quiet. And Wimbleweather tiptoed away to find some place where he could be miserable in peace and stepped on somebody's tail and somebody (they said afterwards it was a fox) bit him. And so everyone was out of temper.

But in the secret and magical chamber at the heart of the How, King Caspian, with Cornelius and the Badger and Nikabrik and Trumpkin, were at council. Thick pillars of ancient workmanship supported the roof. In the centre was the Stone itself—a stone table, split right down the centre, and covered with what had once been writing of some kind: but ages of wind and rain and snow had almost worn them away in old times when the Stone Table had stood on the hilltop, and the Mound had not yet been built above it. They were not using the Table nor sitting round it: it was too magic a thing for any common use. They sat on logs a little way from it, and between them was a rough wooden table, on which stood a rude clay lamp lighting up their pale faces and throwing big shadows on the walls.

“If your Majesty is ever to use the Horn,” said Trufflehunter, “I think the time has now come.” Caspian had of course told them of this treasure several days ago.

“We are certainly in great need,” answered Caspian. “But it is hard to be sure we are at our greatest. Supposing there came an even worse need and we had already used it?”

“By that argument,” said Nikabrik, “your Majesty will never use it until it is too late.”

“I agree with that,” said Doctor Cornelius.

“And what do you think, Trumpkin?” asked Caspian.

“Oh, as for me,” said the Red Dwarf, who had been listening with complete indifference, “your Majesty knows I think the Horn—and that bit of broken stone over there—and your great King Peter—and your Lion Aslan—are all eggs in moonshine. It's all one to me when your Majesty blows the Horn. All I insist is that the army is told nothing about it. There's no good raising hopes of magical help which (as I think) are sure to be disappointed.”

“Then in the name of Aslan we will wind Queen Susan's Horn,” said Caspian.

“There is one thing, Sire,” said Doctor Cornelius, “that should perhaps be done first. We do not know what form the help will take. It might call Aslan himself from oversea. But I think it is more likely to call Peter the High King and his mighty consorts down from the high past. But in either case, I do not think we can be sure that the help will come to this very spot—”

“You never said a truer word,” put in Trumpkin.

“I think,” went on the learned man, “that they—or he—will come back to one or other of the Ancient Places of Narnia. This, where we now sit, is the most ancient and most deeply magical of all, and here, I think, the answer is likeliest to come. But there are two others. One is Lantern Waste, up-river, west of Beaversdam, where the Royal Children first appeared in Narnia, as the records tell. The other is down at the river-mouth, where their castle of Cair Paravel once stood. And if Aslan himself comes, that would be the best place for meeting him too, for every story says that he is the son of the great Emperor-over-Sea, and over the sea he will pass. I should like very much to send messengers to both places, to Lantern Waste and the river-mouth, to receive them—or him—or it.”

“Just as I thought,” muttered Trumpkin. “The first result of all this foolery is not to bring us help but to lose us two fighters.”

“Who would you think of sending, Doctor Cornelius?” asked Caspian.

“Squirrels are best for getting through enemy country without being caught,” said Trufflehunter.

“All our squirrels (and we haven't many),” said Nikabrik, “are rather flighty. The only one I'd trust on a job like that would be Pattertwig.”

“Let it be Pattertwig, then,” said King Caspian. “And who for our other messenger? I know you'd go, Trufflehunter, but you haven't the speed. Nor you, Doctor Cornelius.”

“I won't go,” said Nikabrik. “With all these Humans and beasts about, there must be a Dwarf here to see that the Dwarfs are fairly treated.”

“Thimbles and thunderstorms!” cried Trumpkin in a rage. “Is that how you speak to the King? Send me, Sire, I'll go.”

“But I thought you didn't believe in the Horn, Trumpkin,” said Caspian.

“No more I do, your Majesty. But what's that got to do with it? I might as well die on a wild goose chase as die here. You are my King. I know the difference between giving advice and taking orders. You've had my advice, and now it's the time for orders.”

“I will never forget this, Trumpkin,” said Caspian. “Send for Pattertwig, one of you. And when shall I blow the Horn?”

“I would wait for sunrise, your Majesty,” said Doctor Cornelius. “That sometimes has an effect in operations of White Magic.”

A few minutes later Pattertwig arrived and had his task explained to him. As he was, like many squirrels, full of courage and dash and energy and excitement and mischief (not to say conceit), he no sooner heard it than he was eager to be off. It was arranged that he should run for Lantern Waste while Trumpkin made the shorter journey to the river-mouth. After a hasty meal they both set off with the fervent thanks and good wishes of the King, the Badger, and Cornelius.





CHAPTER 8　HOW THEY LEFT THE ISLAND


“AND so,” said Trumpkin (for, as you have realised, it was he who had been telling all this story to the four children, sitting on the grass in the ruined hall of Cair Paravel)— “and so I put a crust or two in my pocket, left behind all weapons but my dagger, and took to the woods in the grey of the morning. I'd been plugging away for many hours when there came a sound that I'd never heard the like of in my born days. Eh, I won't forget that. The whole air was full of it, loud as thunder but far longer, cool and sweet as music over water, but strong enough to shake the woods. And I said to myself, ‘If that's not the Horn, call me a rabbit.’ And a moment later I wondered why he hadn't blown it sooner—”

“What time was it?” asked Edmund.

“Between nine and ten of the clock,” said Trumpkin.

“Just when we were at the railway station!” said all the children, and looked at one another with shining eyes.

“Please go on,” said Lucy to the Dwarf.

“Well, as I was saying, I wondered, but I went on as hard as I could pelt. I kept on all night—and then, when it was half light this morning, as if I'd no more sense than a Giant, I risked a short cut across open country to cut off a big loop of the river, and was caught. Not by the army, but by a pompous old fool who has charge of a little castle which is Miraz's last stronghold towards the coast. I needn't tell you they got no true tale out of me, but I was a Dwarf and that was enough. But, lobsters and lollipops! it is a good thing the seneschal was a pompous fool. Anyone else would have run me through there and then. But nothing would do for him short of a grand execution: sending me down ‘to the ghosts’ in the full ceremonial way. And then this young lady” (he nodded at Susan) “does her bit of archery—and it was pretty shooting, let me tell you—and here we are. And without my armour, for of course they took that.” He knocked out and refilled his pipe.

“Great Scott!” said Peter. “So it was the horn—your own horn, Su— that dragged us all off that seat on the platform yesterday morning! I can hardly believe it; yet it all fits in.”

“I don't know why you shouldn't believe it,” said Lucy, “if you believe in magic at all. Aren't there lots of stories about magic forcing people out of one place—out of one world—into another? I mean, when a magician in The Arabian Nights calls up a Jinn, it has to come. We had to come, just like that.”

“Yes,” said Peter, “I suppose what makes it feel so queer is that in the stories it's always someone in our world who does the calling. One doesn't really think about where the Jinn's coming from.”

“And now we know what it feels like for the Jinn,” said Edmund with a chuckle. “Golly! It's a bit uncomfortable to know that we can be whistled for like that. It's worse than what Father says about living at the mercy of the telephone.”

“But we want to be here, don't we,” said Lucy, “if Aslan wants us?”

“Meanwhile,” said the Dwarf, “what are we to do? I suppose I'd better go back to King Caspian and tell him no help has come.”

“No help?” said Susan. “But it has worked. And here we are.”

“Um—um—yes, to be sure. I see that,” said the Dwarf, whose pipe seemed to be blocked (at any rate he made himself very busy cleaning it). “But—well—I mean——”

“But don't you yet see who we are?” shouted Lucy. “You are stupid.”

“I suppose you are the four children out of the old stories,” said Trumpkin. “And I'm very glad to meet you of course. And it's very interesting, no doubt. But—no offence?”—and he hesitated again.

“Do get on and say whatever you're going to say,” said Edmund.

“Well, then—no offence,” said Trumpkin. “But, you know, the King and Trufflehunter and Doctor Cornelius were expecting—well, if you see what I mean, help. To put it in another way, I think they'd been imagining you as great warriors. As it is—we're awfully fond of children and all that, but just at the moment, in the middle of a war—but I'm sure you understand.”

“You mean you think we're no good,” said Edmund, getting red in the face.

“Now pray don't be offended,” interrupted the Dwarf. “I assure you, my dear little friends—”

“Little from you is really a bit too much,” said Edmund, jumping up. “I suppose you don't believe we won the Battle of Beruna? Well, you can say what you like about me because I know—”

“There's no good losing our tempers,” said Peter. “Let's fit him out with fresh armour and fit ourselves out from the treasure chamber, and have a talk after that.”

“I don't quite see the point—” began Edmund, but Lucy whispered in his ear, “Hadn't we better do what Peter says? He is the High King, you know. And I think he has an idea.” So Edmund agreed and by the aid of his torch they all, including Trumpkin, went down the steps again into the dark coldness and dusty splendour of the treasure house.

The Dwarf's eyes glistened as he saw the wealth that lay on the shelves (though it had to stand on tiptoes to do so) and he muttered to himself, “It would never do to let Nikabrik see this; never.” They found easily enough a mail shirt for him, a sword, a helmet, a shield, a bow and quiverful of arrows, all of dwarfish size. The helmet was of copper, set with rubies, and there was gold on the hilt of the sword: Trumpkin had never seen, much less carried, so much wealth in all his life. The children also put on mail shirts and helmets; a sword and shield were found for Edmund and a bow for Lucy—Peter and Susan were of course already carrying their gifts. As they came back up the stairway, jingling in their mail, and already looking and feeling more like Narnians and less like schoolchildren, the two boys were behind, apparently making some plan. Lucy heard Edmund say, “No, let me do it. It will be more of a sucks for him if I win, and less of a let-down for us all if I fail.”

“All right, Ed,” said Peter.

When they came out into the daylight Edmund turned to the Dwarf very politely and said, “I've got something to ask you. Kids like us don't often have the chance of meeting a great warrior like you. Would you have a little fencing match with me? It would be frightfully decent.”

“But, lad,” said Trumpkin, “these swords are sharps.”

“I know,” said Edmund. “But I'll never get anywhere near you and you'll be quite clever enough to disarm me without doing me any damage.”

“It's a dangerous game,” said Trumpkin. “But since you make such a point of it, I'll try a pass or two.”

Both swords were out in a moment and the three others jumped off the dais and stood watching. It was well worth it. It was not like the silly fighting you see with broad swords on the stage. It was not even like the rapier fighting which you sometimes see rather better done. This was real broad-sword fighting. The great thing is to slash at your enemy's legs and feet because they are the part that have no armour. And when he slashes at yours you jump with both feet off the ground so that his blow goes under them. This gave the Dwarf an advantage because Edmund, being much taller, had to be always stooping. I don't think Edmund would have had a chance if he had fought Trumpkin twenty-four hours earlier. But the air of Narnia had been working upon him ever since they arrived on the island, and all his old battles came back to him, and his arms and fingers remembered their old skill. He was King Edmund once more. Round and round the two combatants circled, stroke after stroke they gave, and Susan (who never could learn to like this sort of thing) shouted out, “Oh, do be careful.” And then, so quickly that no one (unless they knew, as Peter did) could quite see how it happened, Edmund flashed his sword round with a peculiar twist, the Dwarf's sword flew out of his grip, and Trumpkin was wringing his empty hand as you do after a “sting” from a cricket-bat.

“Not hurt, I hope, my dear little friend?” said Edmund, panting a little and returning his own sword to its sheath.

“I see the point,” said Trumpkin drily. “You know a trick I never learned.”

“That's quite true,” put in Peter. “The best swordsman in the world may be disarmed by a trick that's new to him. I think it's only fair to give Trumpkin a chance at something else. Will you have a shooting match with my sister? There are no tricks in archery, you know.”

“Ah, you're jokers, you are,” said the Dwarf. “I begin to see. As if I didn't know how she can shoot, after what happened this morning. All the same, I'll have a try.” He spoke gruffly, but his eyes brightened, for he was a famous bowman among his own people.

All five of them came out into the courtyard.

“What's to be the target?” asked Peter.

“I think that apple hanging over the wall on the branch there would do,” said Susan.

“That'll do nicely, lass,” said Trumpkin. “You mean the yellow one near the middle of the arch?”

“No, not that,” said Susan. “The red one up above—over the battlement.”

The Dwarf's face fell. “Looks more like a cherry than an apple,” he muttered, but he said nothing out loud.

They tossed up for first shot (greatly to the interest of Trumpkin, who had never seen a coin tossed before) and Susan lost. They were to shoot from the top of the steps that led from the hall into the courtyard. Everyone could see from the way the Dwarf took his position and handled the bow that he knew what he was about.

Twang went the string. It was an excellent shot. The tiny apple shook as the arrow passed, and a leaf came fluttering down. Then Susan went to the top of the steps and strung her bow. She was not enjoying her match half so much as Edmund had enjoyed his; not because she had any doubt about hitting the apple but because Susan was so tender-hearted that she almost hated to beat someone who had been beaten already. The Dwarf watched her keenly as she drew the shaft to her ear. A moment later, with a little soft thump which they could all hear in that quiet place, the apple fell to the grass with Susan's arrow in it.

“Oh, well done, Su,” shouted the other children.

“It wasn't really any better than yours,” said Susan to the Dwarf. “I think there was a tiny breath of wind as you shot.”

“No there wasn't,” said Trumpkin. “Don't tell me. I know when I am fairly beaten. I won't even say that the scar of my last wound catches me a bit when I get my arm well back—”

“Oh, are you wounded?” asked Lucy. “Do let me look.”

“It's not a sight for little girls,” began Trumpkin, but then he suddenly checked himself. “There I go talking like a fool again,” he said. “I suppose you're as likely to be a great surgeon as your brother was to be a great swordsman or your sister to be a great archer.” He sat down on the steps and took off his hauberk and slipped down his little shirt, showing an arm hairy and muscular (in proportion) as a sailor's though not much bigger than a child's. There was a clumsy bandage on the shoulder which Lucy proceeded to unroll. Underneath, the cut looked very nasty and there was a good deal of swelling. “Oh, poor Trumpkin,” said Lucy. “How horrid.” Then she carefully dripped onto it one single drop of the cordial from her flask.

“Hullo. Eh? What have you done?” said Trumpkin. But however he turned his head and squinted and whisked his beard to and fro, he couldn't quite see his own shoulder. Then he felt it as well as he could, getting his arms and fingers into very difficult positions as you do when you're trying to scratch a place that is just out of reach. Then he swung his arm and raised it and tried the muscles, and finally jumped to his feet crying, “Giants and junipers! It's cured! It's as good as new.” After that he burst into a great laugh and said, “Well, I've made as big a fool of myself as ever a Dwarf did. No offence, I hope? My humble duty to your Majesties all—humble duty. And thanks for my life, my cure, my breakfast—and my lesson.”

The children all said it was quite all right and not to mention it.

“And now,” said Peter, “if you've really decided to believe in us—”

“I have,” said the Dwarf.

“It's quite clear what we have to do. We must join King Caspian at once.”

“The sooner the better,” said Trumpkin. “My being such a fool has already wasted about an hour.”

“It's about two days' journey, the way you came,” said Peter. “For us, I mean. We can't walk all day and night like you Dwarfs.” Then he turned to the others. “What Trumpkin calls Aslan's How is obviously the Stone Table itself. You remember it was about half a day's march, or a little less, from there down to the Fords of Beruna—”

“Beruna's Bridge, we call it,” said Trumpkin.

“There was no bridge in our time,” said Peter. “And then from Beruna down to here was another day and a bit. We used to get home about teatime on the second day, going easily. Going hard, we could do the whole thing in a day and a half perhaps.”

“But remember it's all woods now,” said Trumpkin, “and there are enemies to dodge.”

“Look here,” said Edmund, “need we go by the same way that Our Dear Little Friend came?”

“No more of that, your Majesty, if you love me,” said the Dwarf.

“Very well,” said Edmund. “May I say our D.L.F.?”

“Oh, Edmund,” said Susan. “Don't keep on at him like that.”

“That's all right, lass—I mean your Majesty,” said Trumpkin with a chuckle. “A jibe won't raise a blister.” (And after that they often called him the D.L.F. till they'd almost forgotten what it meant.)

“As I was saying,” continued Edmund, “we needn't go that way. Why shouldn't we row a little south till we come to Glasswater Creek and row up it? That brings us up behind the Hill of the Stone Table, and we'll be safe while we're at sea. If we start at once, we can be at the head of Glasswater before dark, get a few hours' sleep, and be with Caspian pretty early tomorrow.”

“What a thing it is to know the coast,” said Trumpkin. “None of us know anything about Glasswater.”

“What about food?” asked Susan.

“Oh, we'll have to do with apples,” said Lucy. “Do let's get on. We've done nothing yet, and we've been here nearly two days.”

“And anyway, no one's going to have my hat for a fish-basket again,” said Edmund.

They used one of the raincoats as a kind of bag and put a good many apples in it. Then they all had a good long drink at the well (for they would meet no more fresh water till they landed at the head of the Creek) and went down to the boat. The children were sorry to leave Cair Paravel, which, even in ruins, had begun to feel like home again.

“The D.L.F. had better steer,” said Peter, “and Ed and I will take an oar each. Half a moment, though. We'd better take off our mail: we're going to be pretty warm before we're done. The girls had better be in the bows and shout directions to the D.L.F. because he doesn't know the way. You'd better get us a fair way out to sea till we've passed the island.”

And soon the green, wooded coast of the island was falling away behind them, and its little bays and headlands were beginning to look flatter, and the boat was rising and falling in the gentle swell. The sea began to grow bigger around them and, in the distance, bluer, but close round the boat it was green and bubbly. Everything smelled salt and there was no noise except the swishing of water and the clop-clop of water against the sides and the splash of the oars and the jolting noise of the rowlocks. The sun grew hot.

It was delightful for Lucy and Susan in the bows, bending over the edge and trying to get their hands in the sea which they could never quite reach. The bottom, mostly pure, pale sand but with occasional patches of purple seaweed, could be seen beneath them.

“It's like old times,” said Lucy. “Do you remember our voyage to Terebinthia—and Galma—and Seven Isles—and the Lone Islands?”

“Yes,” said Susan, “and our great ship the Splendour Hyaline, with the swan's head at her prow and the carved swan's wings coming back almost to her waist?”

“And the silken sails, and the great stern lanterns?”

“And the feasts on the poop and the musicians.”

“Do you remember when we had the musicians up in the rigging playing flutes so that it sounded like music out of the sky?”

Presently Susan took over Edmund's oar and he came forward to join Lucy. They had passed the island now and stood closer in to the shore—all wooded and deserted. They would have thought it very pretty if they had not remembered the time when it was open and breezy and full of merry friends.

“Phew! This is pretty gruelling work,” said Peter.

“Can't I row for a bit?” said Lucy.

“The oars are too big for you,” said Peter shortly, not because he was cross but because he had no strength to spare for talking.





CHAPTER 9　WHAT LUCY SAW


SUSAN and the two boys were bitterly tired with rowing before they rounded the last headland and began the final pull up Glasswater itself, and Lucy's head ached from the long hours of sun and the glare on the water. Even Trumpkin longed for the voyage to be over. The seat on which he sat to steer had been made for men, not Dwarfs, and his feet did not reach the floor-boards; and everyone knows how uncomfortable that is even for ten minutes. And as they all grew more tired, their spirits fell. Up till now the children had only been thinking of how to get to Caspian. Now they wondered what they would do when they found him, and how a handful of Dwarfs and woodland creatures could defeat an army of grown-up Humans.

Twilight was coming on as they rowed slowly up the windings of Glasswater Creek—a twilight which deepened as the banks drew closer together and the overhanging trees began almost to meet overhead. It was very quiet in here as the sound of the sea died away behind them; they could even hear the trickle of the little streams that poured down from the forest into Glasswater.

They went ashore at last, far too tired to attempt lighting a fire; and even a supper of apples (though most of them felt that they never wanted to see an apple again) seemed better than trying to catch or shoot anything. After a little silent munching they all huddled down together in the moss and dead leaves between four large beech trees.

Everyone except Lucy went to sleep at once. Lucy, being far less tired, found it hard to get comfortable. Also, she had forgotten till now that all Dwarfs snore. She knew that one of the best ways of getting to sleep is to stop trying, so she opened her eyes. Through a gap in the bracken and branches she could just see a patch of water in the Creek and the sky above it. Then, with a thrill of memory, she saw again, after all those years, the bright Narnian stars. She had once known them better than the stars of our own world, because as a Queen in Narnia she had gone to bed much later than as a child in England. And there they were—at least, three of the summer constellations could be seen from where she lay: the Ship, the Hammer, and the Leopard. “Dear old Leopard,” she murmured happily to herself.

Instead of getting drowsier she was getting more awake—with an odd, night-time, dreamish kind of wakefulness. The Creek was growing brighter. She knew now that the moon was on it, though she couldn't see the moon. And now she began to feel that the whole forest was coming awake like herself. Hardly knowing why she did it, she got up quickly and walked a little distance away from their bivouac.

“This is lovely,” said Lucy to herself. It was cool and fresh; delicious smells were floating everywhere. Somewhere close by she heard the twitter of a nightingale beginning to sing, then stopping, then beginning again. It was a little lighter ahead. She went towards the light and came to a place where there were fewer trees, and whole patches or pools of moonlight, but the moonlight and the shadows so mixed that you could hardly be sure where anything was or what it was. At the same moment the nightingale, satisfied at last with his tuning up, burst into full song.

Lucy's eyes began to grow accustomed to the light, and she saw the trees that were nearest her more distinctly. A great longing for the old days when the trees could talk in Narnia came over her. She knew exactly how each of these trees would talk if only she could wake them, and what sort of human form it would put on. She looked at a silver birch: it would have a soft, showery voice and would look like a slender girl, with hair blown all about her face, and fond of dancing. She looked at the oak: he would be a wizened, but hearty old man with a frizzled beard and warts on his face and hands, and hair growing out of the warts. She looked at the beech under which she was standing. Ah!—she would be the best of all. She would be a gracious goddess, smooth and stately, the lady of the wood.

“Oh, Trees, Trees, Trees,” said Lucy (though she had not been intending to speak at all). “Oh, Trees, wake, wake, wake. Don't you remember it? Don't you remember me? Dryads and Hamadryads, come out, come to me.”

Though there was not a breath of wind they all stirred about her. The rustling noise of the leaves was almost like words. The nightingale stopped singing as if to listen to it. Lucy felt that at any moment she would begin to understand what the trees were trying to say. But the moment did not come. The rustling died away. The nightingale resumed its song. Even in the moonlight the wood looked more ordinary again. Yet Lucy had the feeling (as you sometimes have when you are trying to remember a name or a date and almost get it, but it vanishes before you really do) that she had just missed something: as if she had spoken to the trees a split second too soon or a split second too late, or used all the right words except one, or put in one word that was just wrong.

Quite suddenly she began to feel tired. She went back to the bivouac, snuggled down between Susan and Peter, and was asleep in a few minutes.

It was a cold and cheerless waking for them all next morning, with a grey twilight in the wood (for the sun had not yet risen) and everything damp and dirty.

“Apples, heigh-ho,” said Trumpkin with a rueful grin. “I must say you ancient kings and queens don't overfeed your courtiers!”

They stood up and shook themselves and looked about. The trees were thick and they could see no more than a few yards in any direction.

“I suppose your Majesties know the way all right?” said the Dwarf.

“I don't,” said Susan. “I've never seen these woods in my life before. In fact I thought all along that we ought to have gone by the river.”

“Then I think you might have said so at the time,” answered Peter, with pardonable sharpness.

“Oh, don't take any notice of her,” said Edmund. “She always is a wet blanket. You've got that pocket compass of yours, Peter, haven't you? Well, then, we're as right as rain. We've only got to keep on going northwest—cross that little river, the what-do-you-call-it?—the Rush——”

“I know,” said Peter. “The one that joins the big river at the Fords of Beruna, or Beruna's Bridge, as the D.L.F. calls it.”

“That's right. Cross it and strike uphill, and we'll be at the Stone Table (Aslan's How, I mean) by eight or nine o'clock. I hope King Caspian will give us a good breakfast!”

“I hope you're right,” said Susan. “I can't remember all that at all.”

“That's the worst of girls,” said Edmund to Peter and the Dwarf. “They never can carry a map in their heads.”

“That's because our heads have something inside them,” said Lucy.

At first things seemed to be going pretty well. They even thought they had struck an old path; but if you know anything about woods, you will know that one is always finding imaginary paths. They disappear after about five minutes and then you think you have found another (and hope it is not another but more of the same one) and it also disappears, and after you have been well lured out of your right direction you realise that none of them were paths at all. The boys and the Dwarf, however, were used to woods and were not taken in for more than a few seconds.

They had plodded on for about half an hour (three of them very stiff from yesterday's rowing) when Trumpkin suddenly whispered, “Stop.” They all stopped. “There's something following us,” he said in a low voice. “Or rather, something keeping up with us: over there on the left.” They all stood still, listening and staring till their ears and eyes ached. “You and I'd better each have an arrow on the string,” said Susan to Trumpkin. The Dwarf nodded, and when both bows were ready for action the party went on again.

They went a few dozen yards through fairly open woodland, keeping a sharp look-out. Then they came to a place where the undergrowth thickened and they had to pass nearer to it. Just as they were passing the place, there came a sudden something that snarled and flashed, rising out from the breaking twigs like a thunderbolt. Lucy was knocked down and winded, hearing the twang of a bowstring as she fell. When she was able to take notice of things again, she saw a great grim-looking grey bear lying dead with Trumpkin's arrow in its side.

“The D.L.F. beat you in that shooting match, Su,” said Peter, with a slightly forced smile. Even he had been shaken by this adventure.

“I—I left it too late,” said Susan, in an embarrassed voice. “I was so afraid it might be, you know—one of our kind of bears, a talking bear.” She hated killing things.

“That's the trouble of it,” said Trumpkin, “when most of the beasts have gone enemy and gone dumb, but there are still some of the other kind left. You never know, and you daren't wait to see.”

“Poor old Bruin,” said Susan. “You don't think he was?”

“Not he,” said the Dwarf. “I saw the face and I heard the snarl. He only wanted Little Girl for his breakfast. And talking of breakfast, I didn't want to discourage your Majesties when you said you hoped King Caspian would give you a good one: but meat's precious scarce in camp. And there's good eating on a bear. It would be a shame to leave the carcass without taking a bit, and it won't delay us more than half an hour. I dare say you two youngsters—Kings, I should say—know how to skin a bear?”

“Let's go and sit down a fair way off,” said Susan to Lucy. “I know what a horrid messy business that will be.” Lucy shuddered and nodded. When they had sat down she said: “Such a horrible idea has come into my head, Su.”

“What's that?”

“Wouldn't it be dreadful if some day in our own world, at home, men started going wild inside, like the animals here, and still looked like men, so that you'd never know which were which?”

“We've got enough to bother about here and now in Narnia,” said the practical Susan, “without imagining things like that.”

When they rejoined the boys and the Dwarf, as much as they thought they could carry of the best meat had been cut off. Raw meat is not a nice thing to fill one's pockets with, but they folded it up in fresh leaves and made the best of it. They were all experienced enough to know that they would feel quite differently about these squashy and unpleasant parcels when they had walked long enough to be really hungry.

On they trudged again (stopping to wash three pairs of hands that needed it in the first stream they passed) until the sun rose and the birds began to sing, and more flies than they wanted were buzzing in the bracken. The stiffness from yesterday's rowing began to wear off. Everybody's spirits rose. The sun grew warmer and they took their helmets off and carried them.

“I suppose we are going right?” said Edmund about an hour later.

“I don't see how we can go wrong as long as we don't bear too much to the left,” said Peter. “If we bear too much to the right, the worst that can happen is wasting a little time by striking the Great River too soon and not cutting off the corner.”

And again they trudged on with no sound except the thud of their feet and the jingle of their chain shirts.

“Where's this bally Rush got to?” said Edmund a good deal later.

“I certainly thought we'd have struck it by now,” said Peter. “But there's nothing to do but keep on.” They both knew that the Dwarf was looking anxiously at them, but he said nothing.

And still they trudged on and their mail shirts began to feel very hot and heavy.

“What on earth?” said Peter suddenly.

They had come, without seeing it, almost to the edge of a small precipice from which they looked down into a gorge with a river at the bottom. On the far side the cliffs rose much higher. None of the party except Edmund (and perhaps Trumpkin) was a rock climber.

“I'm sorry,” said Peter. “It's my fault for coming this way. We're lost. I've never seen this place in my life before.”

The Dwarf gave a low whistle between his teeth.

“Oh, do let's go back and go the other way,” said Susan. “I knew all along we'd get lost in these woods.”

“Susan!” said Lucy, reproachfully, “don't nag at Peter like that. It's so rotten, and he's doing all he can.”

“And don't you snap at Su like that, either,” said Edmund. “I think she's quite right.”

“Tubs and tortoiseshells!” exclaimed Trumpkin. “If we've got lost coming, what chance have we of finding our way back? And if we're to go back to the Island and begin all over again—even supposing we could— we might as well give the whole thing up. Miraz will have finished with Caspian before we get there at that rate.”

“You think we ought to go on?” said Lucy.

“I'm not sure the High King is lost,” said Trumpkin. “What's to hinder this river being the Rush?”

“Because the Rush is not in a gorge,” said Peter, keeping his temper with some difficulty.

“Your Majesty says is,” replied the Dwarf, “but oughtn't you to say was? You knew this country hundreds—it may be a thousand—years ago. Mayn't it have changed? A landslide might have pulled off half the side of that hill, leaving bare rock, and there are your precipices beyond the gorge. Then the Rush might go on deepening its course year after year till you get the little precipices this side. Or there might have been an earthquake, or anything.”

“I never thought of that,” said Peter.

“And anyway,” continued Trumpkin, “even if this is not the Rush, it's flowing roughly north and so it must fall into the Great River anyway. I think I passed something that might have been it, on my way down. So if we go downstream, to our right, we'll hit the Great River. Perhaps not so high as we'd hoped, but at least we'll be no worse off than if you'd come my way.”

“Trumpkin, you're a brick,” said Peter. “Come on, then. Down this side of the gorge.”

“Look! Look! Look!” cried Lucy.

“Where? What?” asked everyone.

“The Lion,” said Lucy. “Aslan himself. Didn't you see?” Her face had changed completely and her eyes shone.

“Do you really mean—” began Peter.

“Where did you think you saw him?” asked Susan.

“Don't talk like a grown-up,” said Lucy, stamping her foot. “I didn't think I saw him. I saw him.”

“Where, Lu?” asked Peter.

“Right up there between those mountain ashes. No, this side of the gorge. And up, not down. Just the opposite of the way you want to go. And he wanted us to go where he was—up there.”

“How do you know that was what he wanted?” asked Edmund.

“He—I—I just know,” said Lucy, “by his face.”

The others all looked at each other in puzzled silence.

“Her Majesty may well have seen a lion,” put in Trumpkin. “There are lions in these woods, I've been told. But it needn't have been a friendly and talking lion any more than the bear was a friendly and talking bear.”

“Oh, don't be so stupid,” said Lucy. “Do you think I don't know Aslan when I see him?”

“He'd be a pretty elderly lion by now,” said Trumpkin, “if he's one you knew when you were here before! And if it could be the same one, what's to prevent him having gone wild and witless like so many others?”

Lucy turned crimson and I think she would have flown at Trumpkin, if Peter had not laid his hand on her arm. “The D.L.F. doesn't understand. How could he? You must just take it, Trumpkin, that we do really know about Aslan; a little bit about him, I mean. And you mustn't talk about him like that again. It isn't lucky for one thing: and it's all nonsense for another. The only question is whether Aslan was really there.”

“But I know he was,” said Lucy, her eyes filling with tears.

“Yes, Lu, but we don't, you see,” said Peter.

“There's nothing for it but a vote,” said Edmund.

“All right,” replied Peter. “You're the eldest, D.L.F. What do you vote for? Up or down?”

“Down,” said the Dwarf. “I know nothing about Aslan. But I do know that if we turn left and follow the gorge up, it might lead us all day before we found a place where we could cross it. Whereas if we turn right and go down, we're bound to reach the Great River in about a couple of hours. And if there are any real lions about, we want to go away from them, not towards them.”

“What do you say, Susan?”

“Don't be angry, Lu,” said Susan, “but I do think we should go down. I'm dead tired. Do let's get out of this wretched wood into the open as quick as we can. And none of us except you saw anything.”

“Edmund?” said Peter.

“Well, there's just this,” said Edmund, speaking quickly and turning a little red. “When we first discovered Narnia a year ago—or a thousand years ago, whichever it is—it was Lucy who discovered it first and none of us would believe her. I was the worst of the lot, I know. Yet she was right after all. Wouldn't it be fair to believe her this time? I vote for going up.”

“Oh, Ed!” said Lucy and seized his hand.

“And now it's your turn, Peter,” said Susan, “and I do hope—”

“Oh, shut up, shut up and let a chap think,” interrupted Peter. “I'd much rather not have to vote.”

“You're the High King,” said Trumpkin sternly.

“Down,” said Peter after a long pause. “I know Lucy may be right after all, but I can't help it. We must do one or the other.”

So they set off to their right along the edge, downstream. And Lucy came last of the party, crying bitterly.





CHAPTER 10　THE RETURN OF THE LION


TO keep along the edge of the gorge was not so easy as it had looked. Before they had gone many yards they were confronted with young fir woods growing on the very edge, and after they had tried to go through these, stooping and pushing for about ten minutes, they realised that, in there, it would take them an hour to do half a mile. So they came back and out again and decided to go round the fir wood. This took them much farther to their right than they wanted to go, far out of sight of the cliffs and out of sound of the river, till they began to be afraid they had lost it altogether. Nobody knew the time, but it was getting to the hottest part of the day.

When they were able at last to go back to the edge of the gorge (nearly a mile below the point from which they had started) they found the cliffs on their side of it a good deal lower and more broken. Soon they found a way down into the gorge and continued the journey at the river's edge. But first they had a rest and a long drink. No one was talking any more about breakfast, or even dinner, with Caspian.

They may have been wise to stick to the Rush instead of going along the top. It kept them sure of their direction: and ever since the fir wood they had all been afraid of being forced too far out of their course and losing themselves in the wood. It was an old and pathless forest, and you could not keep anything like a straight course in it. Patches of hopeless brambles, fallen trees, boggy places and dense undergrowth would be always getting in your way. But the gorge of the Rush was not at all a nice place for travelling either. I mean, it was not a nice place for people in a hurry. For an afternoon's ramble ending in a picnic tea it would have been delightful. It had everything you could want on an occasion of that sort—rumbling waterfalls, silver cascades, deep, amber-coloured pools, mossy rocks, and deep moss on the banks in which you could sink over your ankles, every kind of fern, jewel-like dragon flies, sometimes a hawk overhead and once (Peter and Trumpkin both thought) an eagle. But of course what the children and the Dwarf wanted to see as soon as possible was the Great River below them, and Beruna, and the way to Aslan's How.

As they went on, the Rush began to fall more and more steeply. Their journey became more and more of a climb and less and less of a walk—in places even a dangerous climb over slippery rock with a nasty drop into dark chasms, and the river roaring angrily at the bottom.

You may be sure they watched the cliffs on their left eagerly for any sign of a break or any place where they could climb them; but those cliffs remained cruel. It was maddening, because everyone knew that if once they were out of the gorge on that side, they would have only a smooth slope and a fairly short walk to Caspian's headquarters.

The boys and the Dwarf were now in favor of lighting a fire and cooking their bear-meat. Susan didn't want this; she only wanted, as she said, “to get on and finish it and get out of these beastly woods”. Lucy was far too tired and miserable to have any opinion about anything. But as there was no dry wood to be had, it mattered very little what anyone thought. The boys began to wonder if raw meat was really as nasty as they had always been told. Trumpkin assured them it was.

Of course, if the children had attempted a journey like this a few days ago in England, they would have been worn out. I think I have explained before how Narnia was altering them. Even Lucy was by now, so to speak, only one-third of a little girl going to boarding school for the first time, and two-thirds of Queen Lucy of Narnia.

“At last!” said Susan.

“Oh, hurray!” said Peter.

The river gorge had just made a bend and the whole view spread out beneath them. They could see open country stretching before them to the horizon and, between it and them, the broad silver ribbon of the Great River. They could see the specially broad and shallow place which had once been the Fords of Beruna but was now spanned by a long, many-arched bridge. There was a little town at the far end of it.

“By Jove,” said Edmund. “We fought the Battle of Beruna just where that town is!”

This cheered the boys more than anything. You can't help feeling stronger when you look at a place where you won a glorious victory not to mention a kingdom, hundreds of years ago. Peter and Edmund were soon so busy talking about the battle that they forgot their sore feet and the heavy drag of their mail shirts on their shoulders. The Dwarf was interested too.

They were all getting on at a quicker pace now. The going became easier. Though there were still sheer cliffs on their left, the ground was becoming lower on their right. Soon it was no longer a gorge at all, only a valley. There were no more waterfalls and presently they were in fairly thick woods again.

Then—all at once—whizz, and a sound rather like the stroke of a woodpecker. The children were still wondering where (ages ago) they had heard a sound just like that and why they disliked it so, when Trumpkin shouted, “Down,” at the same moment forcing Lucy (who happened to be next to him) flat down into the bracken. Peter, who had been looking up to see if he could spot a squirrel, had seen what it was—a long cruel arrow had sunk into a tree trunk just above his head. As he pulled Susan down and dropped himself, another came rasping over his shoulder and struck the ground at his side.

“Quick! Quick! Get back! Crawl!” panted Trumpkin.

They turned and wriggled along uphill, under the bracken amid clouds of horribly buzzing flies. Arrows whizzed round them. One struck Susan's helmet with a sharp ping and glanced off. They crawled quicker. Sweat poured off them. Then they ran, stooping nearly double. The boys held their swords in their hands for fear they would trip them up.

It was heart-breaking work—all uphill again, back over the ground they had already travelled. When they felt that they really couldn't run any more, even to save their lives, they all dropped down in the damp moss beside a waterfall and behind a big boulder, panting. They were surprised to see how high they had already got.

They listened intently and heard no sound of pursuit.

“So that's all right,” said Trumpkin, drawing a deep breath. “They're not searching the wood. Only sentries, I expect. But it means that Miraz has an outpost down there. Bottles and battledores! though, it was a near thing.”

“I ought to have my head smacked for bringing us this way at all,” said Peter.

“On the contrary, your Majesty,” said the Dwarf. “For one thing it wasn't you, it was your royal brother, King Edmund, who first suggested going by Glasswater.”

“I'm afraid the D.L.F.'s right,” said Edmund, who had quite honestly forgotten this ever since things began going wrong.

“And for another,” continued Trumpkin, “if we'd gone my way, we'd have walked straight into that new outpost, most likely; or at least had just the same trouble avoiding it. I think this Glasswater route has turned out for the best.”

“A blessing in disguise,” said Susan.

“Some disguise!” said Edmund.

“I suppose we'll have to go right up the gorge again now,” said Lucy.

“Lu, you're a hero,” said Peter. “That's the nearest you've got today to saying I told you so. Let's get on.”

“And as soon as we're well up into the forest,” said Trumpkin, “whatever anyone says, I'm going to light a fire and cook supper. But we must get well away from here.”

There is no need to describe how they toiled back up the gorge. It was pretty hard work, but oddly enough everyone felt more cheerful. They were getting their second wind; and the word supper had had a wonderful effect.

They reached the fir wood which had caused them so much trouble while it was still daylight, and bivouacked in a hollow just above it. It was tedious gathering the fire wood; but it was grand when the fire blazed up and they began producing the damp and smeary parcels of bear-meat which would have been so very unattractive to anyone who had spent the day indoors. The Dwarf had splendid ideas about cookery. Each apple (they still had a few of these) was wrapped up in bear-meat—as if it was to be apple dumpling with meat instead of pastry, only much thicker— and spiked on a sharp stick and then roasted. And the juice of the apple worked all through the meat, like apple sauce with roast pork. Bear that has lived too much on other animals is not very nice, but bear that has had plenty of honey and fruit is excellent, and this turned out to be that sort of bear. It was a truly glorious meal. And, of course, no washing up—only lying back and watching the smoke from Trumpkin's pipe and stretching one's tired legs and chatting. Everyone felt quite hopeful now about finding King Caspian tomorrow and defeating Miraz in a few days. It may not have been sensible of them to feel like this, but they did.

They dropped off to sleep one by one, but all pretty quickly.

Lucy woke out of the deepest sleep you can imagine, with the feeling that the voice she liked best in the world had been calling her name. She thought at first it was her father's voice, but that did not seem quite right. Then she thought it was Peter's voice, but that did not seem to fit either. She did not want to get up; not because she was still tired—on the contrary she was wonderfully rested and all the aches had gone from her bones—but because she felt so extremely happy and comfortable. She was looking straight up at the Narnian moon, which is larger than ours, and at the starry sky, for the place where they had bivouacked was comparatively open.

“Lucy,” came the call again, neither her father's voice nor Peter's. She sat up, trembling with excitement but not with fear. The moon was so bright that the whole forest landscape around her was almost as clear as day, though it looked wilder. Behind her was the fir wood; away to her right the jagged cliff-tops on the far side of the gorge; straight ahead, open grass to where a glade of trees began about a bow-shot away. Lucy looked very hard at the trees of that glade.

“Why, I do believe they're moving,” she said to her self. “They're walking about.”

She got up, her heart beating wildly, and walked towards them. There was certainly a noise in the glade, a noise such as trees make in a high wind, though there was no wind tonight. Yet it was not exactly an ordinary tree-noise either. Lucy felt there was a tune in it, but she could not catch the tune any more than she had been able to catch the words when the trees had so nearly talked to her the night before. But there was, at least, a lilt; she felt her own feet wanting to dance as she got nearer. And now there was no doubt that the trees were really moving—moving in and out through one another as if in a complicated country dance. (“And I suppose,” thought Lucy, “when trees dance, it must be a very, very country dance indeed.”) She was almost among them now.

The first tree she looked at seemed at first glance to be not a tree at all but a huge man with a shaggy beard and great bushes of hair. She was not frightened: she had seen such things before. But when she looked again he was only a tree, though he was still moving. You couldn't see whether he had feet or roots, of course, because when trees move they don't walk on the surface of the earth; they wade in it as we do in water. The same thing happened with every tree she looked at. At one moment they seemed to be the friendly, lovely giant and giantess forms which the tree-people put on when some good magic has called them into full life: next moment they all looked like trees again. But when they looked like trees, it was like strangely human trees, and when they looked like people, it was like strangely branchy and leafy people—and all the time that queer lilting, rustling, cool, merry noise.

“They are almost awake, not quite,” said Lucy. She knew she herself was wide awake, wider than anyone usually is.

She went fearlessly in among them, dancing herself as, she leaped this way and that to avoid being run into by these huge partners. But she was only half interested in them. She wanted to get beyond them to something else; it was from beyond them that the dear voice had called.

She soon got through them (half wondering whether she had been using her arms to push branches aside, or to take hands in a Great Chain with big dancers who stooped to reach her) for they were really a ring of trees round a central open place. She stepped out from among their shifting confusion of lovely lights and shadows.

A circle of grass, smooth as a lawn, met her eyes, with dark trees dancing all round it. And then—oh joy! For he was there: the huge Lion, shining white in the moonlight, with his huge black shadow underneath him.

But for the movement of his tail he might have been a stone lion, but Lucy never thought of that. She never stopped to think whether he was a friendly lion or not. She rushed to him. She felt her heart would burst if she lost a moment. And the next thing she knew was that she was kissing him and putting her arms as far round his neck as she could and burying her face in the beautiful rich silkiness of his mane.

“Aslan, Aslan. Dear Aslan,” sobbed Lucy. “At last.”

The great beast rolled over on his side so that Lucy fell, half sitting and half lying between his front paws. He bent forward and just touched her nose with his tongue. His warm breath came all round her. She gazed up into the large wise face.

“Welcome, child,” he said.

“Aslan,” said Lucy, “you're bigger.”

“That is because you are older, little one,” answered he.

“Not because you are?”

“I am not. But every year you grow, you will find me bigger.”

For a time she was so happy that she did not want to speak. But Aslan spoke.

“Lucy,” he said, “we must not lie here for long. You have work in hand, and much time has been lost today.”

“Yes, wasn't it a shame?” said Lucy. “I saw you all right. They wouldn't believe me. They're all so—”

From somewhere deep inside Aslan's body there came the faintest suggestion of a growl.

“I'm sorry,” said Lucy, who understood some of his moods. “I didn't mean to start slanging the others. But it wasn't my fault anyway, was it?”

The Lion looked straight into her eyes.

“Oh, Aslan,” said Lucy. “You don't mean it was? How could I—I couldn't have left the others and come up to you alone, how could I? Don't look at me like that... oh well, I suppose I could. Yes, and it wouldn't have been alone, I know, not if I was with you. But what would have been the good?”

Aslan said nothing.

“You mean,” said Lucy rather faintly, “that it would have turned out all right—somehow? But how? Please, Aslan! Am I not to know?”

“To know what would have happened, child?” said Aslan. “No. Nobody is ever told that.”

“Oh dear,” said Lucy.

“But anyone can find out what will happen,” said Aslan. “If you go back to the others now, and wake them up; and tell them you have seen me again; and that you must all get up at once and follow me—what will happen? There is only one way of finding out.”

“Do you mean that is what you want me to do?” gasped Lucy.

“Yes, little one,” said Aslan.

“Will the others see you too?” asked Lucy.

“Certainly not at first,” said Aslan. “Later on, it depends.”

“But they won't believe me!” said Lucy.

“It doesn't matter,” said Aslan.

“Oh dear, oh dear,” said Lucy. “And I was so pleased at finding you again. And I thought you'd let me stay. And I thought you'd come roaring in and frighten all the enemies away—like last time. And now everything is going to be horrid.”

“It is hard for you, little one,” said Aslan. “But things never happen the same way twice. It has been hard for us all in Narnia before now.”

Lucy buried her head in his mane to hide from his face. But there have been magic in his mane. She could feel lion-strength going into . Quite suddenly she sat up.

“I'm sorry, Aslan,” she said. “I'm ready now.”

“Now you are a lioness,” said Aslan. “And now all Narnia will be renewed. But come. We have no time to lose.”

He got up and walked with stately, noiseless paces back to the belt of dancing trees through which she had just come: and Lucy went with him, laying a rather tremulous hand on his mane. The trees parted to let them through and for one second assumed their human forms completely. Lucy had a glimpse of tall and lovely wood-gods and wood-goddesses all bowing to the Lion; next moment they were trees again, but still bowing, with such graceful sweeps of branch and trunk that their bowing was itself a kind of dance.

“Now, child,” said Aslan, when they had left the trees behind them, “I will wait here. Go and wake the others and tell them to follow. If they will not, then you at least must follow me alone.”

It is a terrible thing to have to wake four people, all older than yourself and all very tired, for the purpose of telling them something they probably won't believe and making them do something they certainly won't like. “I mustn't think about it, I must just do it,” thought Lucy.

She went to Peter first and shook him. “Peter,” she whispered in his ear, “wake up. Quick. Aslan is here. He says we've got to follow him at once.”

“Certainly, Lu. Whatever you like,” said Peter unexpectedly. This was encouraging, but as Peter instantly rolled round and went to sleep again it wasn't much use.

Then she tried Susan. Susan did really wake up, but only to say in her most annoying grown-up voice, “You've been dreaming, Lucy. Go to sleep again.”

She tackled Edmund next. It was very difficult to wake him, but when at last she had done it he was really awake and sat up.

“Eh?” he said in a grumpy voice. “What are you talking about?”

She said it all over again. This was one of the worst parts of her job, for each time she said it, it sounded less convincing.

“Aslan!” said Edmund, jumping up. “Hurray! Where?”

Lucy turned back to where she could see the Lion waiting, his patient eyes fixed upon her. “There,” she said, pointing.

“Where?” asked Edmund again.

“There. There. Don't you see? Just this side of the trees.”

Edmund stared hard for a while and then said, “No. There's nothing there. You've got dazzled and muddled with the moonlight. One does, you know. I thought I saw something for a moment myself. It's only an optical what-do-you-call-it.”

“I can see him all the time,” said Lucy. “He's looking straight at us.”

“Then why can't I see him?”

“He said you mightn't be able to.”

“Why?”

“I don't know. That's what he said.”

“Oh, bother it all,” said Edmund. “I do wish you wouldn't keep on seeing things. But I suppose we'll have to wake the others.”





CHAPTER 11　THE LION ROARS


WHEN the whole party was finally awake Lucy had to tell her story for the fourth time. The blank silence which followed it was as discouraging as anything could be.

“I can't see anything,” said Peter after he had stared his eyes sore. “Can you, Susan?”

“No, of course I can't,” snapped Susan. “Because there isn't anything to see. She's been dreaming. Do lie down and go to sleep, Lucy.”

“And I do hope,” said Lucy in a tremulous voice, “that you will all come with me. Because—because I'll have to go with him whether anyone else does or not.”

“Don't talk nonsense, Lucy,” said Susan. “Of course you can't go off on your own. Don't let her, Peter. She's being downright naughty.”

“I'll go with her, if she must go,” said Edmund. “She's been right before.”

“I know she has,” said Peter. “And she may have been right this morning. We certainly had no luck going down the gorge. Still—at this hour of the night. And why should Aslan be invisible to us? He never used to be. It's not like him. What does the D.L.F. say?”

“Oh, I say nothing at all,” answered the Dwarf. “If you all go, of course, I'll go with you; and if your party splits up, I'll go with the High King. That's my duty to him and King Caspian. But, if you ask my private opinion, I'm a plain dwarf who doesn't think there's much chance of a road by night where you couldn't find one by day. And I have use for magic lions which are talking lions and don't talk, and friendly lions though they don't do us any good, and whopping big lions though nobody can see them. It's all bilge and beanstalks as far as I can see.”

“He's beating his paw on the ground for us to hurry,” said Lucy. “We must go now. At least I must.”

“You've no right to try to force the rest of us like that. It's four to one and you're the youngest,” said Susan.

“Oh, come on,” growled Edmund. “We've got to go. There'll be no peace till we do.” He fully intended to back Lucy up, but he was annoyed at losing his night's sleep and was making up for it by doing everything as sulkily as possible.

“On the march, then,” said Peter, wearily fitting his arm into his shield-strap and putting his helmet on. At any other time he would have said something nice to Lucy, who was his favourite sister, for he knew how wretched she must be feeling, and he knew that, whatever had happened, it was not her fault. But he couldn't help being a little annoyed with her all the same.

Susan was the worst. “Supposing I started behaving like Lucy,” she said. “I might threaten to stay here whether the rest of you went on or not. I jolly well think I shall.”

“Obey the High King, your Majesty,” said Trumpkin, “and let's be off. If I'm not to be allowed to sleep, I'd as soon march as stand here talking.”

And so at last they got on the move. Lucy went first, biting her lip trying not to say all the things she thought of saying to Susan. But she them when she fixed her eyes on Aslan. He turned and walked at a pace about thirty yards ahead of them. The others had only Lucy's to guide them, for Aslan was not only invisible to them but as well. His big cat-like paws made no noise on the grass.

He led them to the right of the dancing trees—whether they were still dancing nobody knew, for Lucy had her eyes on the Lion and the rest had their eyes on Lucy—and nearer the edge of the gorge. “Cobbles and kettledrums!” thought Trumpkin. “I hope this madness isn't going to end in a moonlight climb and broken necks.”

For a long way Aslan went along the top of the precipices. Then they came to a place where some little trees grew right on the edge. He turned and disappeared among them. Lucy held her breath, for it looked as if he had plunged over the cliff; but she was too busy keeping him in sight to stop and think about this. She quickened her pace and was soon among the trees herself. Looking down, she could see a steep and narrow path going slantwise down into the gorge between rocks, and Aslan descending it. He turned and looked at her with his happy eyes. Lucy clapped her hands and began to scramble down after him. From behind her she heard the voices of the others shouting, “Hi! Lucy! Look out, for goodness' sake. You're right on the edge of the gorge. Come back—” and then, a moment later, Edmund's voice saying, “No, she's right. There is a way down.”

Half-way down the path Edmund caught up with her.

“Look!” he said in great excitement. “Look! What's that shadow crawling down in front of us?”

“It's his shadow,” said Lucy.

“I do believe you're right, Lu,” said Edmund. “I can't think how I didn't see it before. But where is he?”

“With his shadow, of course. Can't you see him?”

“Well, I almost thought I did—for a moment. It's such a rum light.”

“Get on, King Edmund, get on,” came Trumpkin's voice from behind and above: and then, farther behind and still nearly at the top, Peter's saying, “Oh, buck up, Susan. Give me your hand. Why, a baby get down here. And do stop grousing.”

In a few minutes they were at the bottom and the roaring of water their ears. Treading delicately, like a cat, Aslan stepped from stone stone across the stream. In the middle he stopped, bent down to drink, and as he raised his shaggy head, dripping from the water, he turned to face them again. This time Edmund saw him. “Oh, Aslan!” he cried, darting forward. But the Lion whisked round and began padding up the slope on the far side of the Rush.

“Peter, Peter,” cried Edmund. “Did you see?”

“I saw something,” said Peter. “But it's so tricky in this moonlight. On we go, though, and three cheers for Lucy. I don't feel half so tired now, either.”

Aslan without hesitation led them to their left, farther up the gorge. The whole journey was odd and dream-like—the roaring stream, the wet grey grass, the glimmering cliffs which they were approaching, and always the glorious, silently pacing Beast ahead. Everyone except Susan and the Dwarf could see him now.

Presently they came to another steep path, up the face of the farther precipices. These were far higher than the ones they had just descended, and the journey up them was a long and tedious zig-zag. Fortunately the Moon shone right above the gorge so that neither side was in shadow.

Lucy was nearly blown when the tail and hind legs of Aslan disappeared over the top: but with one last effort she scrambled after him and came out, rather shaky-legged and breathless, on the hill they had been trying to reach ever since they left Glasswater. The long gentle slope (heather and grass and a few very big rocks that shone white in the moonlight) stretched up to where it vanished in a glimmer of trees about half a mile away. She knew it. It was the hill of the Stone Table.

With a jingling of mail the others climbed up behind her. Aslan on before them and they walked after him.

“Lucy,” said Susan in a very small voice.

“Yes?” said Lucy.

“I see him now. I'm sorry.”

“That's all right.”

“But I've been far worse than you know. I really believed it was him—he, I mean—yesterday. When he warned us not to go down to the fir wood. And I really believed it was him tonight, when you woke us up. I mean, deep down inside. Or I could have, if I'd let myself. But I just wanted to get out of the woods and—and—oh, I don't know. And what ever am I to say to him?”

“Perhaps you won't need to say much,” suggested Lucy.

Soon they reached the trees and through them the children could see the Great Mound, Aslan's How, which had been raised over the Table since their days.

“Our side don't keep very good watch,” muttered Trumpkin. “We ought to have been challenged before now—”

“Hush!” said the other four, for now Aslan had stopped and turned and stood facing them, looking so majestic that they felt as glad as anyone can who feels afraid, and as afraid as anyone can who feels glad. The boys strode forward: Lucy made way for them: Susan and the Dwarf shrank back.

“Oh, Aslan,” said King Peter, dropping on one knee and raising the Lion's heavy paw to his face, “I'm so glad. And I'm so sorry. I've been leading them wrong ever since we started and especially yesterday morning.”

“My dear son,” said Aslan.

Then he turned and welcomed Edmund. “Well done,” were his words.

Then, after an awful pause, the deep voice said, “Susan.” Susan made no answer but the others thought she was crying. “You have listened to fears, child,” said Aslan. “Come, let me breathe on you. Forget them. Are you brave again?”

“A little, Aslan,” said Susan.

“And now!” said Aslan in a much louder voice with just a hint of a roar in it, while his tail lashed his flanks. “And now, where is this little Dwarf, this famous swordsman and archer, who doesn't believe in lions? Come here, son of Earth, come HERE!”—and the last word was no longer the hint of a roar but almost the real thing.

“Wraiths and wreckage!” gasped Trumpkin in the ghost of a voice. The children, who knew Aslan well enough to see that he liked the Dwarf very much, were not disturbed; but it was quite another thing for Trumpkin, who had never seen a lion before, let alone this Lion. He did the only sensible thing he could have done; that is, instead of bolting, he tottered towards Aslan.

Aslan pounced. Have you ever seen a very young kitten being carried in the mother cat's mouth? It was like that. The Dwarf, hunched up in a little, miserable ball, hung from Aslan's mouth. The Lion gave him one shake and all his armour rattled like a tinker's pack and then—heypresto—the Dwarf flew up in the air. He was as safe as if he had been in bed, though he did not feel so. As he came down the huge velvety paws caught him as gently as a mother's arms and set him (right way up, too) on the ground.

“Son of Earth, shall we be friends?” asked Aslan.

“Ye—he—he—hes,” panted the Dwarf, for it had not yet got its breath back.

“Now,” said Aslan. “The Moon is setting. Look behind you: there is the dawn beginning. We have no time to lose. You three, you sons of Adam and son of Earth, hasten into the Mound and deal with what you find there.”

The Dwarf was still speechless and neither of the boys dared to ask if Aslan would follow them. All three drew their swords and saluted, then turned and jingled away into the dusk. Lucy noticed that there was no sign of weariness in their faces: both the High King and King Edmund looked more like men than boys.

The girls watched them out of sight, standing close beside Aslan. The light was changing. Low down in the east, Aravir, the morning star of Narnia, gleamed like a little moon. Aslan, who seemed larger than before, lifted his head, shook his mane, and roared.

The sound, deep and throbbing at first like an organ beginning on a low note, rose and became louder, and then far louder again, till the earth and air were shaking with it. It rose up from that hill and floated across all Narnia. Down in Miraz's camp men woke, stared palely in one another's faces, and grasped their weapons. Down below that in the Great River, now at its coldest hour, the heads and shoulders of the nymphs, and the great weedy-bearded head of the river-god, rose from the water. Beyond it, in every field and wood, the alert ears of rabbits rose from their holes, the sleepy heads of birds came out from under wings, owls hooted, vixens barked, hedgehogs grunted, the trees stirred. In towns and villages mothers pressed babies close to their breasts, staring with wild eyes, dogs whimpered, and men leaped up groping for lights. Far away on the northern frontier the mountain giants peered from the dark gateways of their castles.

What Lucy and Susan saw was a dark something coming to them from almost every direction across the hills. It looked first like a black mist creeping on the ground, then like the stormy waves of a black sea rising higher and higher as it came on, and then, at last, like what it was— woods on the move. All the trees of the world appeared to be rushing towards Aslan. But as they drew nearer they looked less like trees, and when the whole crowd, bowing and curtsying and waving thin long arms to Aslan, were all around Lucy, she saw that it was a crowd of human shapes. Pale birch-girls were tossing their heads, willow-women pushed back their hair from their brooding faces to gaze on Aslan, the queenly beeches stood still and adored him, shaggy oak-men, lean and melancholy elms, shock-headed hollies (dark themselves, but their wives all bright with berries) and gay rowans, all bowed and rose again, shouting, “Aslan, Aslan!” in their various husky or creaking or wave-like voices.

The crowd and the dance round Aslan (for it had become a dance once more) grew so thick and rapid that Lucy was confused. She never saw where certain other people came from who were soon capering about among the trees. One was a youth, dressed only in a fawn-skin, with vine-leaves wreathed in his curly hair. His face would have been almost too pretty for a boy's, if it had not looked so extremely wild. You felt, as Edmund said when he saw him a few days later, “There's a chap who might do anything—absolutely anything.” He seemed to have a great many names—Bromios, Bassareus, and the Ram were three of them. There were a lot of girls with him, as wild as he. There was even, unexpectedly, someone on a donkey. And everybody was laughing: and every body was shouting out, “Euan, euan, eu-oi-oi-oi.”

“Is it a Romp, Aslan?” cried the youth. And apparently it was. But nearly everyone seemed to have a different idea as to what they were playing. It may have been Tig, but Lucy never discovered who was It. It was rather like Blind Man's Buff, only everyone behaved as if they were blindfolded. It was not unlike Hunt the Slipper, but the slipper was never found. What made it more complicated was that the man on the donkey, who was old and enormously fat, began calling out at once, “Refreshments! Time for refreshments,” and falling off his donkey and being bundled on to it again by the others, while the donkey was under the impression that the whole thing was a circus and tried to give a display of walking on its hind legs. And all the time there were more and more vine leaves everywhere. And soon not only leaves but vines. They were climbing up everything. They were running up the legs of the tree people and circling round their necks. Lucy put up her hands to push back her hair and found she was pushing back vine branches. The donkey was a mass of them. His tail was completely entangled and something dark was nodding between his ears. Lucy looked again and saw it was a bunch of grapes. After that it was mostly grapes—overhead and underfoot and all around.

“Refreshments! Refreshments,” roared the old man. Everyone began eating, and whatever hothouses your people may have, you have never tasted such grapes. Really good grapes, firm and tight on the outside, but bursting into cool sweetness when you put them into your mouth, were one of the things the girls had never had quite enough of before. Here, there were more than anyone could possibly want, and no table-manners at all. One saw sticky and stained fingers everywhere, and, though mouths were full, the laughter never ceased nor the yodelling cries of Euan, euan, eu-oi-oi-oi-oi, till all of a sudden everyone felt at the same moment that the game (whatever it was), and the feast, ought to be over, and everyone flopped down breathless on the ground and turned their faces to Aslan to hear what he would say next.

At that moment the sun was just rising and Lucy remembered something and whispered to Susan,

“I say, Su, I know who they are.”

“Who?”

“The boy with the wild face is Bacchus and the old one on the is Silenus. Don't you remember Mr Tumnus telling us about them ago?”

“Yes, of course. But I say, Lu—”

“What?”

“I wouldn't have felt very safe with Bacchus and all his wild girls if we'd met them without Aslan.”

“I should think not,” said Lucy.





CHAPTER 12　SORCERY AND SUDDEN VENGEANCE


MEANWHILE Trumpkin and the two boys arrived at the dark little stone archway which led into the inside of the Mound, and two sentinel badgers (the white patches on their cheeks were all Edmund could see of them) leaped up with bared teeth and asked them in snarling voices, “Who goes there?”

“Trumpkin,” said the Dwarf. “Bringing the High King of Narnia out of the far past.”

The badgers nosed at the boys' hands. “At last,” they said. “At last.”

“Give us a light, friends,” said Trumpkin.

The badgers found a torch just inside the arch and Peter lit it and handed it to Trumpkin. “The D.L.F. had better lead,” he said. “We don't know our way about this place.”

Trumpkin took the torch and went ahead into the dark tunnel. It was a cold, black, musty place, with an occasional bat fluttering in the torchlight, and plenty of cobwebs. The boys, who had been mostly in the open air since that morning at the railway station, felt as if they were going into a trap or a prison.

“I say, Peter,” whispered Edmund. “Look at those carvings on the walls. Don't they look old? And yet we're older than that. When we were last here, they hadn't been made.”

“Yes,” said Peter. “That makes one think.”

The Dwarf went on ahead and then turned to the right, and then to the left, and then down some steps, and then to the left again. Then at last they saw a light ahead—light from under a door. And now for the first time they heard voices, for they had come to the door of the central chamber. The voices inside were angry ones. Someone was talking so loudly that the approach of the boys and the Dwarf had not been heard.

“Don't like the sound of that,” whispered Trumpkin to Peter. “Let's listen for a moment.” All three stood perfectly still on the outside of the door.

“You know well enough,” said a voice (“That's the King,” whispered Trumpkin), “why the Horn was not blown at sunrise that morning. Have you forgotten that Miraz fell upon us almost before Trumpkin had gone, and we were fighting for our lives for the space of three hours and more? I blew it when first I had a breathing space.”

“I'm not likely to forget it,” came the angry voice, “when my Dwarfs bore the brunt of the attack and one in five of them fell.” (“That's Nikabrik,” whispered Trumpkin.)

“For shame, Dwarf,” came a thick voice (“Trufflehunter's,” said Trumpkin). “We all did as much as the Dwarfs and none more than the King.”

“Tell that tale your own way for all I care,” answered Nikabrik. “But whether it was that the Horn was blown too late, or whether there was no magic in it, no help has come. You, you great clerk, you master magician, you know-all; are you still asking us to hang our hopes on Aslan and King Peter and all the rest of it?”

“I must confess—I cannot deny it—that I am deeply disappointed in the result of the operation,” came the answer. (“That'll be Doctor Cornelius,” said Trumpkin.)

“To speak plainly,” said Nikabrik, “your wallet's empty, your eggs , your fish uncaught, your promises broken. Stand aside then and others work. And that is why—”

“The help will come,” said Trufflehunter. “I stand by Aslan. Have patience, like us beasts. The help will come. It may be even now at the door.”

“Pah!” snarled Nikabrik. “You badgers would have us wait till the sky falls and we can all catch larks. I tell you we can't wait. Food is running short; we lose more than we can afford at every encounter; our followers are slipping away.”

“And why?” asked Trufflehunter. “I'll tell you why. Because it is noised among them that we have called on the Kings of old and the Kings of old have not answered. The last words Trumpkin spoke before he went (and went, most likely, to his death) were, ‘If you must blow the Horn, do not let the army know why you blow it or what you hope from it.’ But that same evening everyone seemed to know.”

“You'd better have shoved your gray snout in a hornets' nest, Badger, than suggest that I am the blab,” said Nikabrik. “Take it back, or—”

“Oh, stop it, both of you,” said King Caspian. “I want to know what it is that Nikabrik keeps on hinting we should do. But before that, I want to know who those two strangers are whom he has brought into our council and who stand there with their ears open and their mouths shut.”

“They are friends of mine,” said Nikabrik. “And what better right have you yourself to be here than that you are a friend of Trumpkin's and the Badger's? And what right has that old dotard in the black gown to be here except that he is your friend? Why am I to be the only one who can't bring in his friends?”

“His Majesty is the King to whom you have sworn allegiance,” said Trufflehunter sternly.

“Court manners, court manners,” sneered Nikabrik. “But in this hole we may talk plainly. You know—and he knows—that this Telmarine boy will be king of nowhere and nobody in a week unless we can help him out of the trap in which he sits.”

“Perhaps,” said Cornelius, “your new friends would like to speak for themselves? You there, who and what are you?”

“Worshipful Master Doctor,” came a thin, whining voice. “So please you, I'm only a poor old woman, I am, and very obliged to his Worshipful Dwarfship for his friendship, I'm sure. His Majesty, bless his handsome face, has no need to be afraid of an old woman that's nearly doubled up with the rheumatics and hasn't two sticks to put under her kettle. I have some poor little skill—not like yours, Master Doctor, of course—in small spells and cantrips that I'd be glad to use against our enemies if it was agreeable to all concerned. For I hate 'em. Oh yes. No one hates better than me.”

“That is all most interesting and—er—satisfactory,” said Doctor Cornelius. “I think I now know what you are, Madam. Perhaps your other friend, Nikabrik, would give some account of himself?”

A dull, gray voice at which Peter's flesh crept replied, “I'm hunger. I'm thirst. Where I bite, I hold till I die, and even after death they must cut out my mouthful from my enemy's body and bury it with me. I can fast a hundred years and not die. I can lie a hundred nights on the ice and not freeze. I can drink a river of blood and not burst. Show me your enemies.”

“And it is in the presence of these two that you wish to disclose your plan?” said Caspian.

“Yes,” said Nikabrik. “And by their help that I mean to execute it.”

There was a minute or two during which Trumpkin and the boys could hear Caspian and his two friends speaking in low voices but could not make out what they were saying. Then Caspian spoke aloud.

“Well, Nikabrik,” he said, “we will hear your plan.”

There was a pause so long that the boys began to wonder if Nikabrik ever going to begin; when he did, it was in a lower voice, as if he himself did not much like what he was saying.

“All said and done,” he muttered, “none of us knows the truth about the ancient days in Narnia. Trumpkin believed none of the stories. I was ready to put them to the trial. We tried first the Horn and it has failed. If there ever was a High King Peter and a Queen Susan and a King Edmund and a Queen Lucy, then either they have not heard us, or they cannot come, or they are our enemies—”

“Or they are on the way,” put in Trufflehunter.

“You can go on saying that till Miraz has fed us all to his dogs. As I was saying, we have tried one link in the chain of old legends, and it has done us no good. Well. But when your sword breaks, you draw your dagger. The stories tell of other powers beside the ancient Kings and Queens. How if we could call them up?”

“If you mean Aslan,” said Trufflehunter, “it's all one calling on him and on the Kings. They were his servants. If he will not send them (but I make no doubt he will), is he more likely to come himself?”

“No. You're right there,” said Nikabrik. “Aslan and the Kings go together. Either Aslan is dead, or he is not on our side. Or else something stronger than himself keeps him back. And if he did come—how do we know he'd be our friend? He was not always a good friend to Dwarfs by all that's told. Not even to all beasts. Ask the Wolves. And anyway, he was in Narnia only once that I ever heard of, and he didn't stay long. You may drop Aslan out of the reckoning. I was thinking of someone else.”

There was no answer, and for a few minutes it was so still that Edmund could hear the wheezy and snuffling breath of the Badger.

“Who do you mean?” said Caspian at last.

“I mean a power so much greater than Aslan's that it held Narnia for years and years, if the stories are true.”

“The White Witch!” cried three voices all at once, and from the noise Peter guessed that three people had leaped to their feet.

“Yes,” said Nikabrik very slowly and distinctly, “I mean the Witch. Sit down again. Don't all take fright at a name as if you were children. We want power: and we want a power that will be on our side. As for power, do not the stories say that the Witch defeated Aslan, and bound him, and killed him on that very stone which is over there, just beyond the light?”

“But they also say that he came to life again,” said the Badger sharply.

“Yes, they say,” answered Nikabrik, “but you'll notice that we hear precious little about anything he did afterwards. He just fades out of the story. How do you explain that, if he really came to life? Isn't it much more likely that he didn't, and that the stories say nothing more about him because there was nothing more to say?”

“He established the Kings and Queens,” said Caspian.

“A King who has just won a great battle can usually establish himself without the help of a performing lion,” said Nikabrik. There was a fierce growl, probably from Trufflehunter.

“And anyway,” Nikabrik continued, “what came of the Kings and their reign? They faded too. But it's very different with the Witch. They say she ruled for a hundred years: a hundred years of winter. There's power, if you like. There's something practical.”

“But, heaven and earth!” said the King, “haven't we always been told that she was the worst enemy of all? Wasn't she a tyrant ten times worse than Miraz?”

“Perhaps,” said Nikabrik in a cold voice. “Perhaps she was for you humans, if there were any of you in those days. Perhaps she was for some of the beasts. She stamped out the Beavers, I dare say; at least there are none of them in Narnia now. But she got on all right with us Dwarfs. I'm a Dwarf and I stand by my own people. We're not afraid of the Witch.”

“But you've joined with us,” said Trufflehunter.

“Yes, and a lot of good it has done my people, so far,” snapped Nikabrik. “Who is sent on all the dangerous raids? The Dwarfs. Who goes short when the rations fail? The Dwarfs. Who—?”

“Lies! All lies!” said the Badger.

“And so,” said Nikabrik, whose voice now rose to a scream, “if you can't help my people, I'll go to someone who can.”

“Is this open treason, Dwarf?” asked the King.

“Put that sword back in its sheath, Caspian,” said Nikabrik. “Murder at council, eh? Is that your game? Don't be fool enough to try it. Do you think I'm afraid of you? There's three on my side, and three on yours.”

“Come on, then,” snarled Trufflehunter, but he was immediately interrupted.

“Stop, stop, stop,” said Doctor Cornelius. “You go on too fast. The Witch is dead. All the stories agree on that. What does Nikabrik mean by calling on the Witch?”

That grey and terrible voice which had spoken only once before said, “Oh, is she?”

And then the shrill, whining voice began, “Oh, bless his heart, his dear little Majesty needn't mind about the White Lady—that's what we call her—being dead. The Worshipful Master Doctor is only making game of a poor old woman like me when he says that. Sweet Master Doctor, learned Master Doctor, who ever heard of a witch that really died? You can always get them back.”

“Call her up,” said the gray voice. “We are all ready. Draw the circle. Prepare the blue fire.”

Above the steadily increasing growl of the Badger and Cornelius's “What?” rose the voice of King Caspian like thunder.

“So that is your plan, Nikabrik! Black sorcery and the calling up of an accursed ghost. And I see who your companions are—a Hag and a Wer-Wolf!”

The next minute or so was very confused. There was an animal roaring, a clash of steel; the boys and Trumpkin rushed in; Peter had a glimpse of a horrible, gray, gaunt creature, half man and half wolf, in the very act of leaping upon a boy about his own age, and Edmund saw a badger and a Dwarf rolling on the floor in a sort of cat fight. Trumpkin found himself face to face with the Hag. Her nose and chin stuck out like a pair of nut-crackers, her dirty gray hair was flying about her face and she had just got Doctor Cornelius by the throat. At one slash of Trumpkin's sword her head rolled on the floor. Then the light was knocked over and it was all swords, teeth, claws, fists and boots for about sixty seconds. Then silence.

“Are you all right, Ed?”

“I—I think so,” panted Edmund. “I've got that brute Nikabrik, but he's still alive.”

“Weights and water-bottles!” came an angry voice. “It's me you're sitting on. Get off. You're like a young elephant.”

“Sorry, D.L.F.,” said Edmund. “Is that better?”

“Ow! No!” bellowed Trumpkin. “You're putting your boot in my mouth. Go away.”

“Is King Caspian anywhere?” asked Peter.

“I'm here,” said a rather faint voice. “Something bit me.”

They all heard the noise of someone striking a match. It was Edmund. The little flame showed his face, looking pale and dirty. He blundered about for a little, found the candle (they were no longer using the lamp, for they had run out of oil), set it on the table, and lit it. When flame rose clear, several people scrambled to their feet. Six faces at one another in the candlelight.

“We don't seem to have any enemies left,” said Peter. “There's the Hag, dead.” (He turned his eyes quickly away from her.) “And Nikabrik, dead too. And I suppose this thing is a Wer-Wolf. It's so long since I've seen one. Wolf's head and man's body. That means he was just turning from man into wolf at the moment he was killed. And you, I suppose, are King Caspian?”

“Yes,” said the other boy. “But I've no idea who you are.”

“It's the High King, King Peter,” said Trumpkin.

“Your Majesty is very welcome,” said Caspian.

“And so is your Majesty,” said Peter. “I haven't come to take your place, you know, but to put you into it.”

“Your Majesty,” said another voice at Peter's elbow. He turned and found himself face to face with the Badger. Peter leaned forward, put his arms round the beast and kissed the furry head: it wasn't a girlish thing for him to do, because he was the High King.

“Best of badgers,” he said. “You never doubted us all through.”

“No credit to me, your Majesty,” said Trufflehunter. “I'm a beast and don't change. I'm a badger, what's more, and we hold on.”

“I am sorry for Nikabrik,” said Caspian, “though he hated me from first moment he saw me. He had gone sour inside from long suffering hating. If we had won quickly he might have become a good Dwarf in days of peace. I don't know which of us killed him. I'm glad of that.”

“You're bleeding,” said Peter.

“Yes, I'm bitten,” said Caspian. “It was that—that wolf thing.” Cleaning and bandaging the wound took a little time, and when it was done Trumpkin said, “Now. Before everything else we want some breakfast.”

“But not here,” said Peter.

“No,” said Caspian with a shudder. “And we must send someone to take away the bodies.”

“Let the vermin be flung into a pit,” said Peter. “But the Dwarf we give to his people to be buried in their own fashion.”

They breakfasted at last in another of the dark cellars of Aslan's How. It was not such a breakfast as they would have chosen, for Caspian and Cornelius were thinking of venison pasties, and Peter and Edmund of buttered eggs and hot coffee, but what everyone got was a little bit of cold bear-meat (out of the boys' pockets), a lump of hard cheese, an onion, and a mug of water. But, from the way they fell to, anyone would have supposed it was delicious.





CHAPTER 13　THE HIGH KING IN COMMAND


“NOW,” said Peter, as they finished their meal, “Aslan and the girls (that's Queen Susan and Queen Lucy, Caspian) are somewhere close. We don't know when he will act. In his time, no doubt, not ours. In the meantime he would like us to do what we can on our own. You say, Caspian, we are not strong enough to meet Miraz in pitched battle.”

“I'm afraid not, High King,” said Caspian. He was liking Peter very much, but was rather tongue-tied. It was much stranger for him to meet the great Kings out of the old stories than it was for them to meet him.

“Very well, then,” said Peter, “I'll send him a challenge to single combat.” No one had thought of this before.

“Please,” said Caspian, “could it not be me? I want to avenge my father.”

“You're wounded,” said Peter. “And anyway, wouldn't he just laugh at a challenge from you? I mean, we have seen that you are a king and a warrior but he thinks of you as a kid.”

“But, Sire,” said the Badger, who sat very close to Peter and never took its eyes off him. “Will he accept a challenge even from you? He knows he has the stronger army.”

“Very likely he won't,” said Peter, “but there's always the chance. And even if he doesn't, we shall spend the best part of the day sending heralds to and fro and all that. By then Aslan may have done something. And at least I can inspect the army and strengthen the position. I will send the challenge. In fact I will write it at once. Have you pen and ink, Master Doctor?”

“A scholar is never without them, your Majesty,” answered Doctor Cornelius.

“Very well, I will dictate,” said Peter. And while the Doctor spread out a parchment and opened his ink-horn and sharpened his pen, Peter lent back with half-closed eyes and recalled to his mind the language in which he had written such things long ago in Narnia's golden age.

“Right,” he said at last. “And now, if you are ready, Doctor?”

Doctor Cornelius dipped his pen and waited. Peter dictated as follows:

“Peter, by the gift of Aslan, by election, by prescription, and by conquest, High King over all Kings in Narnia, Emperor of the Lone Islands and Lord of Cair Paravel, Knight of the Most Noble Order of the Lion, to Miraz, Son of Caspian the Eighth, sometime Lord Protector of Narnia and now styling himself King of Narnia, Greeting. Have you got that?”

“Narnia, comma, greeting,” muttered the Doctor. “Yes, Sire.”

“Then begin a new paragraph,” said Peter. “For to prevent the effusion of blood, and for the avoiding all other inconveniences likely to grow from the wars now levied in our realm of Narnia, it is our pleasure to adventure our royal person on behalf of our trusty and well-beloved Caspian in clean wager of battle to prove upon your Lordship's body that the said Caspian is lawful King under us in Narnia both by our gift and by the laws of the Telmarines, and your Lordship twice guilty of treachery both in withholding the dominion of Narnia from the said Caspian and in the most abhominable,—don't forget to spell it with an H, Doctor—bloody, and unnatural murder of your kindly lord and brother King Caspian Ninth of that name. Wherefore we most heartily provoke, challenge, and defy your Lordship to the said combat and monomachy, and have sent these letters by the hand of our well beloved and royal brother Edmund, sometime King under us in Narnia, Duke of Lantern Waste and Count of the Western March, Knight of the Noble Order of the Table, to whom we have given full power of determining with your Lordship all the conditions of the said battle. Given at our lodging in Aslan's How this XII day of the month Greenroof in the first year of Caspian Tenth of Narnia.”

“That ought to do,” said Peter, drawing a deep breath. “And now we must send two others with King Edmund. I think the Giant ought to be one.”

“He's—he's not very clever, you know,” said Caspian.

“Of course not,” said Peter. “But any giant looks impressive if only he will keep quiet. And it will cheer him up. But who for the other?”

“Upon my word,” said Trumpkin, “if you want someone who can kill with looks, Reepicheep would be the best.”

“He would indeed, from all I hear,” said Peter with a laugh. “If only he wasn't so small. They wouldn't even see him till he was close!”

“Send Glenstorm, Sire,” said Trufflehunter. “No one ever laughed at Centaur.”




An hour later two great lords in the army of Miraz, the Lord Glozelle and the Lord Sopespian, strolling along their lines and picking their teeth after breakfast, looked up and saw coming down to them from the wood the Centaur and Giant Wimbleweather, whom they had seen before in battle, and between them a figure they could not recognise. Nor indeed would the other boys at Edmund's school have recognised him if they could have seen him at that moment. For Aslan had breathed on him at their meeting and a kind of greatness hung about him.

“What's to do?” said the Lord Glozelle. “An attack?”

“A parley, rather,” said Sopespian. “See, they carry green branches. They are coming to surrender most likely.”

“He that is walking between the Centaur and the Giant has no look of surrender in his face,” said Glozelle. “Who can he be? It is not the boy Caspian.”

“No indeed,” said Sopespian. “This is a fell warrior, I warrant you, wherever the rebels have got him from. He is (in your Lordship's private ear) a kinglier man than ever Miraz was. And what mail he wears! None of our smiths can make the like.”

“I'll wager my dappled Pomely he brings a challenge, not a surrender,” said Glozelle.

“How then?” said Sopespian. “We hold the enemy in our fist here. Miraz would never be so hair-brained as to throw away his advantage on a .”

“He might be brought to it,” said Glozelle in a much lower voice.

“Softly,” said Sopespian. “Step a little aside here out of earshot of those sentries. Now. Have I taken your Lordship's meaning aright?”

“If the King undertook wager of battle,” whispered Glozelle, “why, either he would kill or be killed.”

“So,” said Sopespian, nodding his head.

“And if he killed we should have won this war.”

“Certainly. And if not?”

“Why, if not, we should be as able to win it without the King's grace as with him. For I need not tell your Lordship that Miraz is no very great captain. And after that, we should be both victorious and kingless.”

“And it is your meaning, my Lord, that you and I could hold this land quite as conveniently without a King as with one?”

Glozelle's face grew ugly. “Not forgetting,” said he, “that it was we first put him on the throne. And in all the years that he has enjoyed it, fruits have come our way? What gratitude has he shown us?”

“Say no more,” answered Sopespian. “But look—here comes one to fetch us to the King's tent.”

When they reached Miraz's tent they saw Edmund and his two companions seated outside it and being entertained with cakes and wine, having already delivered the challenge, and withdrawn while the King was considering it. When they saw them thus at close quarters the two Telmarine lords thought all three of them very alarming.

Inside, they found Miraz, unarmed and finishing his breakfast. His face was flushed and there was a scowl on his brow.

“There!” he growled, flinging the parchment across the table to them. “See what a pack of nursery tales our jackanapes of a nephew has sent us.”

“By your leave, Sire,” said Glozelle. “If the young warrior whom we have just seen outside is the King Edmund mentioned in the writing, then I would not call him a nursery tale but a very dangerous knight.”

“King Edmund, pah!” said Miraz. “Does your Lordship believe those old wives' fables about Peter and Edmund and the rest?”

“I believe my eyes, your Majesty,” said Glozelle.

“Well, this is to no purpose,” said Miraz, “but as touching the challenge, I suppose there is only one opinion between us?”

“I suppose so, indeed, Sire,” said Glozelle.

“And what is that?” asked the King.

“Most infallibly to refuse it,” said Glozelle. “For though I have never been called a coward, I must plainly say that to meet that young man in battle is more than my heart would serve me for. And if (as is likely) his brother, the High King, is more dangerous than he—why, on your life, my Lord King, have nothing to do with him.”

“Plague on you!” cried Miraz. “It was not that sort of counsel I . Do you think I am asking you if I should be afraid to meet this Peter (if there is such a man)? Do you think I fear him? I wanted your counsel on the policy of the matter; whether we, having the advantage, should hazard it on a wager of battle.”

“To which I can only answer, your Majesty,” said Glozelle, “that for all reasons the challenge should be refused. There is death in the strange knight's face.”

“There you are again!” said Miraz, now thoroughly angry. “Are you trying to make it appear that I am as great a coward as your Lordship?”

“Your Majesty may say your pleasure,” said Glozelle sulkily.

“You talk like an old woman, Glozelle,” said the King. “What say you, my Lord Sopespian?”

“Do not touch it, Sire,” was the reply. “And what your Majesty says of the policy of the thing comes in very happily. It gives your Majesty excellent grounds for a refusal without any cause for questioning your Majesty's honour or courage.”

“Great Heaven!” exclaimed Miraz, jumping to his feet. “Are you also bewitched today? Do you think I am looking for grounds to refuse it? You might as well call me coward to my face.”

The conversation was going exactly as the two lords wished, so they said nothing.

“I see what it is,” said Miraz, after staring at them as if his eyes would start out of his head, “you are as lily-livered as hares yourselves and have the effrontery to imagine my heart after the likeness of yours! Grounds for a refusal, indeed! Excuses for not fighting! Are you soldiers? Are you Telmarines? Are you men? And if I do refuse it (as all good reasons of captaincy and martial policy urge me to do) you will think, and teach others to think, I was afraid. Is it not so?”

“No man of your Majesty's age,” said Glozelle, “would be called by any wise soldier for refusing the combat with a great warrior in flower of his youth.”

“So I'm to be a dotard with one foot in the grave, as well as a dastard,” roared Miraz. “I'll tell you what it is, my Lords. With your womanish counsels (ever shying from the true point, which is one of policy) you have done the very opposite of your intent. I had meant to refuse it. But I'll accept it. Do you hear, accept it! I'll not be shamed because some witchcraft or treason has frozen both your bloods.”

“We beseech your Majesty—” said Glozelle, but Miraz had flung out of the tent and they could hear him bawling out his acceptance to Edmund.

The two lords looked at one another and chuckled quietly.

“I knew he'd do it if he were properly chafed,” said Glozelle. “But I'll not forget he called me coward. It shall be paid for.”

There was a great stirring at Aslan's How when the news came back and was communicated to the various creatures. Edmund, with one of Miraz's captains, had already marked out the place for the combat, and ropes and stakes had been put round it. Two Telmarines were to stand at two of the corners, and one in the middle of one side, as marshals of the lists. Three marshals for the other two corners and the other side were to be furnished by the High King. Peter was just explaining to Caspian that he could not be one, because his right to the throne was what they were fighting about, when suddenly a thick, sleepy voice said, “Your Majesty, please.” Peter turned and there stood the eldest of the Bulgy Bears. “If you please, your Majesty,” he said, “I'm a bear, I am.”

“To be sure, so you are, and a good bear too, I don't doubt,” said Peter.

“Yes,” said the Bear. “But it was always a right of the bears to supply one marshal of the lists.”

“Don't let him,” whispered Trumpkin to Peter. “He's a good creature, but he'll shame us all. He'll go to sleep and he will suck his paws. In front of the enemy too.”

“I can't help that,” said Peter. “Because he's quite right. The Bears had that privilege. I can't imagine how it has been remembered all these years, when so many other things have been forgotten.”

“Please, your Majesty,” said the Bear.

“It is your right,” said Peter. “And you shall be one of the marshals. But you must remember not to suck your paws.”

“Of course not,” said the Bear in a very shocked voice.

“Why, you're doing it this minute!” bellowed Trumpkin.

The Bear whipped his paw out of his mouth and pretended he hadn't heard.

“Sire!” came a shrill voice from near the ground.

“Ah—Reepicheep!” said Peter after looking up and down and round as people usually did when addressed by the Mouse.

“Sire,” said Reepicheep. “My life is ever at your command, but my honour is my own. Sire, I have among my people the only trumpeter in your Majesty's army. I had thought, perhaps, we might have been sent with the challenge. Sire, my people are grieved. Perhaps if it were your pleasure that I should be a marshal of the lists, it would content them.”

A noise not unlike thunder broke out from somewhere overhead at this point, as Giant Wimbleweather burst into one of those not very intelligent laughs to which the nicer sorts of Giant are so liable. He checked himself at once and looked as grave as a turnip by the time Reepicheep discovered where the noise came from.

“I am afraid it would not do,” said Peter very gravely. “Some humans are afraid of mice—”

“I had observed it, Sire,” said Reepicheep.

“And it would not be quite fair to Miraz,” Peter continued, “to have in sight anything that might abate the edge of his courage.”

“Your Majesty is the mirror of honour,” said the Mouse with one of his admirable bows. “And on this matter we have but a single mind.... I thought I heard someone laughing just now. If anyone present wishes to make me the subject of his wit, I am very much at his service—with my sword—whenever he has leisure.”

An awful silence followed this remark, which was broken by Peter saying, “Giant Wimbleweather and the Bear and the Centaur Glenstorm shall be our marshals. The combat will be at two hours after noon. Dinner at noon precisely.”

“I say,” said Edmund as they walked away, “I suppose it is all right. I mean, I suppose you can beat him?”

“That's what I'm fighting him to find out,” said Peter.





CHAPTER 14　HOW ALL WERE VERY BUSY


A little before two o'clock Trumpkin and the Badger sat with the rest of the creatures at the wood's edge looking across at the gleaming line of Miraz's army which was about two arrow-shots away. In between, a square space of level grass had been staked for the combat. At the two far corners stood Glozelle and Sopespian with drawn swords. At the near corners were Giant Wimbleweather and the Bulgy Bear, who in spite of all their warnings was sucking his paws and looking, to tell the truth, uncommonly silly. To make up for this, Glenstorm on the right of the lists, stock-still except when he stamped a hind hoof occasionally on the turf, looked much more imposing than the Telmarine baron who faced him on the left. Peter had just shaken hands with Edmund and the Doctor, and was now walking down to the combat. It was like the moment before the pistol goes at an important race, but very much worse.

“I wish Aslan had turned up before it came to this,” said Trumpkin.

“So do I,” said Trufflehunter. “But look behind you.”

“Crows and crockery!” muttered the Dwarf as soon as he had done so. “What are they? Huge people—beautiful people—like gods and goddesses and giants. Hundreds and thousands of them, closing in behind us. What are they?”

“It's the Dryads and Hamadryads and Silvans,” said Trufflehunter. “Aslan has waked them.”

“Humph!” said the Dwarf. “That'll be very useful if the enemy try treachery. But it won't help the High King very much if Miraz proves handier with his sword.”

The Badger said nothing, for now Peter and Miraz were entering the lists from opposite ends, both on foot, both in chain shirts, with helmets and shields. They advanced till they were close together. Both bowed and seemed to speak, but it was impossible to hear what they said. Next moment the two swords flashed in the sunlight. For a second the clash could be heard but it was immediately drowned because both armies began shouting like crowds at a football match.

“Well done, Peter, oh, well done!” shouted Edmund as he saw Miraz reel back a whole pace and a half. “Follow it up, quick!” And Peter did, and for a few seconds it looked as if the fight might be won. But then Miraz pulled himself together—began to make real use of his height and weight. “Miraz! Miraz! The King! The King!” came the roar of the Telmarines. Caspian and Edmund grew white with sickening anxiety.

“Peter is taking some dreadful knocks,” said Edmund.

“Hullo!” said Caspian. “What's happening now?”

“Both falling apart,” said Edmund. “A bit blown, I expect. Watch. Ah, now they're beginning again, more scientifically this time. Circling round and round, feeling each other's defences.”

“I'm afraid this Miraz knows his work,” muttered the Doctor. But hardly had he said this when there was such a clapping and baying and throwing up of hoods among the Old Narnians that it was nearly deafening.

“What was it? What was it?” asked the Doctor. “My old eyes missed it.”

“The High King has pricked him in the arm-pit,” said Caspian, still clapping. “Just where the arm-hole of the hauberk let the point through. First blood.”

“It's looking ugly again now, though,” said Edmund. “Peter's not using his shield properly. He must be hurt in the left arm.”

It was only too true. Everyone could see that Peter's shield hung limp. The shouting of the Telmarines redoubled.

“You've seen more battles than I,” said Caspian. “Is there any chance now?”

“Precious little,” said Edmund. “I suppose he might just do it. With luck.”

“Oh, why did we let it happen at all?” said Caspian.

Suddenly all the shouting on both sides died down. Edmund was puzzled for a moment. Then he said, “Oh, I see. They've both agreed to a rest. Come on, Doctor. You and I may be able to do something for the High King.” They ran down to the lists and Peter came outside the ropes to meet them, his face red and sweaty, his chest heaving.

“Is your left arm wounded?” asked Edmund.

“It's not exactly a wound,” Peter said. “I got the full weight of his shoulder on my shield—like a load of bricks—and the rim of the shield drove into my wrist. I don't think it's broken, but it might be a sprain. If you could tie it up very tight I think I could manage.”

While they were doing this, Edmund asked anxiously, “What do you think of him, Peter?”

“Tough,” said Peter. “Very tough. I have a chance if I can keep him on the hop till his weight and short wind come against him—in this hot sun too. To tell the truth, I haven't much chance else. Give my love to—to everyone at home, Ed, if he gets me. Here he comes into the lists again. So long, old chap. Good-bye, Doctor. And I say, Ed, say something specially nice to Trumpkin. He's been a brick.”

Edmund couldn't speak. He walked back with the Doctor to his own with a sick feeling in his stomach.

But the new bout went well. Peter now seemed to be able to make some use of his shield, and he certainly made good use of his feet. He was almost playing Tig with Miraz now, keeping out of range, shifting his ground, making the enemy work.

“Coward!” booed the Telmarines. “Why don't you stand up to him? Don't you like it, eh? Thought you'd come to fight, not dance. Yah!”

“Oh, I do hope he won't listen to them,” said Caspian.

“Not he,” said Edmund. “You don't know him—Oh!”—for Miraz had got in a blow at last, on Peter's helmet. Peter staggered, slipped sideways, and fell on one knee. The roar of the Telmarines rose like the noise of the sea. “Now, Miraz,” they yelled. “Now. Quick! Quick! Kill him.” But indeed there was no need to egg the usurper on. He was on top of Peter already. Edmund bit his lips till the blood came, as the sword flashed down on Peter. It looked as if it would slash off his head. Thank heavens! it had glanced down his right shoulder. The Dwarf-wrought mail was sound and did not break.

“Great Scott!” cried Edmund. “He's up again. Peter, go it, Peter.”

“I couldn't see what happened,” said the Doctor. “How did he do it?”

“Grabbed Miraz's arm as it came down,” said Trumpkin, dancing with delight. “There's a man for you! Uses his enemy's arm as a ladder. The High King! The High King! Up, Old Narnia!”

“Look,” said Trufflehunter. “Miraz is angry. It is good.”

They were certainly at it hammer and tongs now: such a flurry of blows that it seemed impossible for either not to be killed. As the excitement grew, the shouting almost died away. The spectators were holding their breath. It was most horrible and most magnificent.

A great shout arose from the Old Narnians. Miraz was down—not struck by Peter, but face downwards, having tripped on a tussock. Peter stepped back, waiting for him to rise.

“Oh bother, bother, bother,” said Edmund to himself. “Need he be as gentlemanly as all that? I suppose he must. Comes of being a Knight and a High King. I suppose it is what Aslan would like. But that brute will be up again in a minute and then—”

But “that brute” never rose. The Lords Glozelle and Sopespian had their own plans ready. As soon as they saw their King down they leaped into the lists crying, “Treachery! Treachery! The Narnian traitor has stabbed him in the back while he lay helpless. To arms! To arms, Telmar!”

Peter hardly understood what was happening. He saw two big men running toward him with drawn swords. Then the third Telmarine had leaped over the ropes on his left. “To arms, Narnia! Treachery!” Peter shouted. If all three had set upon him at once he would never have spoken again. But Glozelle stopped to stab his own King dead where he lay: “That's for your insult, this morning,” he whispered as the blade went home. Peter swung to face Sopespian, slashed his legs from under him and, with the back-cut of the same stroke, walloped off his head. Edmund was now at his side crying, “Narnia, Narnia! The Lion!” The whole Telmarine army was rushing towards them. But now the Giant was stamping forward, stooping low and swinging his club. The Centaurs charged. Twang, twang behind and hiss, hiss overhead came the archery of Dwarfs. Trumpkin was fighting at his left. Full battle was joined.

“Come back, Reepicheep, you little ass!” shouted Peter. “You'll only be killed. This is no place for mice.” But the ridiculous little creatures were dancing in and out among the feet of both armies, jabbing with their swords. Many a Telmarine warrior that day felt his foot suddenly pierced as if by a dozen skewers, hopped on one leg cursing the pain, and fell as often as not. If he fell, the mice finished him off; if he did not, someone else did.

But almost before the old Narnians were really warmed to their work found the enemy giving way. Tough-looking warriors turned white, gazed in terror not on the Old Narnians but on something behind them, and then flung down their weapons, shrieking, “The Wood! The Wood! The end of the world!”

But soon neither their cries nor the sound of weapons could be heard any more, for both were drowned in the ocean-like roar of the Awakened Trees as they plunged through the ranks of Peter's army, and then on, in pursuit of the Telmarines. Have you ever stood at the edge of a great wood on a high ridge when a wild south-wester broke over it in full fury on an autumn evening? Imagine that sound. And then imagine that the wood, instead of being fixed to one place, was rushing at you; and was no longer trees but huge people; yet still like trees because their long arms waved like branches and their heads tossed and leaves fell round them in showers. It was like that for the Telmarines. It was a little alarming even for the Narnians. In a few minutes all Miraz's followers were running down to the Great River in the hope of crossing the bridge to the town of Beruna and there defending themselves behind ramparts and closed gates.

They reached the river, but there was no bridge. It had disappeared since yesterday. Then utter panic and horror fell upon them and they all surrendered.

But what had happened to the bridge?

Early that morning, after a few hours' sleep, the girls had waked, to see Aslan standing over them and to hear his voice saying, “We will make holiday.” They rubbed their eyes and looked round them. The trees had all gone but could still be seen moving away toward Aslan's How in a dark mass. Bacchus and the Maenads—his fierce, madcap girls—and Silenus were still with them. Lucy, fully rested, jumped up. Everyone was awake, everyone was laughing, flutes were playing, cymbals clashing. Animals, Talking Animals, were crowding in upon them from every direction.

“What is it, Aslan?” said Lucy, her eyes dancing and her feet wanting to dance.

“Come, children,” said he. “Ride on my back again today.”

“Oh, lovely!” cried Lucy, and both girls climbed on to the warm golden back as they had done no one knew how many years before. Then the whole party moved off—Aslan leading, Bacchus and his Maenads leaping, rushing, and turning somersaults, the beasts frisking round them, and Silenus and his donkey bringing up the rear.

They turned a little to the right, raced down a steep hill, and found the long Bridge of Beruna in front of them. Before they had begun to cross it, however, up out of the water came a great wet, bearded head, larger than a man's, crowned with rushes. It looked at Aslan and out of its mouth a deep voice came.

“Hail, Lord,” it said. “Loose my chains.”

“Who on earth is that?” whispered Susan.

“I think it's the river-god, but hush,” said Lucy.

“Bacchus,” said Aslan. “Deliver him from his chains.”

“That means the bridge, I expect,” thought Lucy. And so it did. Bacchus and his people splashed forward into the shallow water, and a minute later the most curious things began happening. Great, strong trunks of ivy came curling up all the piers of the bridge, growing as quickly as a fire grows, wrapping the stones round, splitting, breaking, separating them. The walls of the bridge turned into hedges gay with hawthorn for a moment and then disappeared as the whole thing with a rush and a rumble collapsed into the swirling water. With much splashing, screaming, and laughter the revellers waded or swam or danced across the ford (“Hurrah! It's the Ford of Beruna again now!” cried the girls) and up the bank on the far side and into the town.

Everyone in the streets fled before their faces. The first house they to was a school: a girls' school, where a lot of Narnian girls, with their hair done very tight and ugly tight collars round their necks and thick tickly stockings on their legs, were having a history lesson. The sort of “History” that was taught in Narnia under Miraz's rule was duller than the truest history you ever read and less true than the most exciting adventure story.

“If you don't attend, Gwendolen,” said the mistress, “and stop looking out of the window, I shall have to give you an order-mark.”

“But please, Miss Frizzle—” began Gwendolen.

“Did you hear what I said, Gwendolen?” asked Miss Frizzle.

“But please, Miss Frizzle,” said Gwendolen, “there's a LION!”

“Take two order-marks for talking nonsense,” said Miss Prizzle. “And now—” A roar interrupted her. Ivy came curling in at the windows of the classroom. The walls became a mass of shimmering green, and leafy branches arched overhead where the ceiling had been. Miss Prizzle found she was standing on grass in a forest glade. She clutched at her desk to steady herself, and found that the desk was a rose-bush. Wild people such as she had never even imagined were crowding round her. Then she saw the Lion, screamed and fled, and with her fled her class, who were mostly dumpy, prim little girls with fat legs. Gwendolen hesitated.

“You'll stay with us, sweetheart?” said Aslan.

“Oh, may I? Thank you, thank you,” said Gwendolen. Instantly she joined hands with two of the Maenads, who whirled her round in a merry dance and helped her take off some of the unnecessary and uncomfortable clothes that she was wearing.

Wherever they went in the little town of Beruna it was the same. Most of the people fled, a few joined them. When they left the town they a larger and a merrier company.

They swept on across the level fields on the north bank, or left bank, the river. At every farm animals came out to join them. Sad old donkeys who had never known joy grew suddenly young again; chained dogs broke their chains; horses kicked their carts to pieces and came trotting along with them—clop-clop—kicking up the mud and whinnying.

At a well in a yard they met a man who was beating a boy. The stick into flower in the man's hand. He tried to drop it, but it stuck to his . His arm became a branch, his body the trunk of a tree, his feet took root. The boy, who had been crying a moment before, burst out laughing and joined them.

At a little town half-way to Beaversdam, where two rivers met, they came to another school, where a tired-looking girl was teaching arithmetic to a number of boys who looked very like pigs. She looked out of the window and saw the divine revellers singing up the street and a stab of joy went through her heart. Aslan stopped right under the window and looked up at her.

“Oh, don't, don't,” she said. “I'd love to. But I mustn't. I must stick to my work. And the children would be frightened if they saw you.”

“Frightened?” said the most pig-like of the boys. “Who's she talking to out of the window? Let's tell the inspector she talks to people out of the window when she ought to be teaching us.”

“Let's go and see who it is,” said another boy, and they all came crowding to the window. But as soon as their mean little faces looked out, Bacchus gave a great cry of Euan, euoi-oi-oi-oi and the boys all began howling with fright and trampling one another down to get out of the door and jumping out of the windows. And it was said afterwards (whether truly or not) that those particular little boys were never seen again, but that there were a lot of very fine little pigs in that part of the country which had never been there before.

“Now, Dear Heart,” said Aslan to the Mistress: and she jumped down joined them.

At Beaversdam they re-crossed the river and came east again along the southern bank. They came to a little cottage where a child stood in the doorway crying. “Why are you crying, my love?” asked Aslan. The child, who had never even seen a picture of a lion, was not afraid of him. “Auntie's very ill,” she said. “She's going to die.” Then Aslan went to go in at the door of the cottage, but it was too small for him. So, when he had got his head through, he pushed with his shoulders (Lucy and Susan fell off when he did this) and lifted the whole house up and it all fell backwards and apart. And there, still in her bed, though the bed was now in the open air, lay a little old woman who looked as if she had Dwarf blood in her. She was at death's door, but when she opened her eyes and saw the bright, hairy head of the lion staring into her face, she did not scream or faint. She said, “Oh, Aslan! I knew it was true. I've been waiting for this all my life. Have you come to take me away?”

“Yes, Dearest,” said Aslan. “But not the long journey yet.” And as spoke, like the flush creeping along the underside of a cloud at sunrise, colour came back to her white face and her eyes grew bright and she sat up and said, “Why, I do declare I feel that better. I think I could take a little breakfast this morning.”

“Here you are, mother,” said Bacchus, dipping a pitcher in the cottage well and handing it to her. But what was in it now was not water but the richest wine, red as red-currant jelly, smooth as oil, strong as beef, warming as tea, cool as dew.

“Eh, you've done something to our well,” said the old woman. “That makes a nice change, that does.” And she jumped out of bed.

“Ride on me,” said Aslan, and added to Susan and Lucy, “You two queens will have to run now.”

“But we'd like that just as well,” said Susan. And off they went .

And so at last, with leaping and dancing and singing, with music and laughter and roaring and barking and neighing, they all came to the place where Miraz's army stood flinging down their swords and holding up their hands, and Peter's army, still holding their weapons and breathing hard, stood round them with stern and glad faces. And the first thing that happened was that the old woman slipped off Aslan's back and ran across to Caspian and they embraced one another; for she was his old nurse.





CHAPTER 15　ASLAN MAKES A DOOR IN THE AIR


AT the sight of Aslan the cheeks of the Telmarine soldiers became the colour of cold gravy, their knees knocked together, and many fell on their faces. They had not believed in lions and this made their fear greater. Even the Red Dwarfs, who knew that he came as a friend, stood with open mouths and could not speak. Some of the Black Dwarfs, who had been of Nikabrik's party, began to edge away. But all the Talking Beasts surged round the Lion, with purrs and grunts and squeaks and whinnies of delight, fawning on him with their tails, rubbing against him, touching him reverently with their noses and going to and fro under his body and between his legs. If you have ever seen a little cat loving a big dog whom it knows and trusts, you will have a pretty good picture of their behaviour. Then Peter, leading Caspian, forced his way through the crowd of animals.

“This is Caspian, Sir,” he said. And Caspian knelt and kissed the Lion's paw.

“Welcome, Prince,” said Aslan. “Do you feel yourself sufficient to up the Kingship of Narnia?”

“I—I don't think I do, Sir,” said Caspian. “I'm only a kid.”

“Good,” said Aslan. “If you had felt yourself sufficient, it would have been a proof that you were not. Therefore, under us and under the High King, you shall be King of Narnia, Lord of Cair Paravel, and Emperor of the Lone Islands. You and your heirs while your race lasts. And your coronation—but what have we here?” For at that moment a curious little procession was approaching—eleven Mice, six of whom carried between them something on a litter made of branches, but the litter was no bigger than a large atlas. No one has ever seen mice more woebegone than these. They were plastered with mud—some with blood too—and their ears were down and their whiskers drooped and their tails dragged in the grass, and their leader piped on his slender pipe a melancholy tune. On the litter lay what seemed little better than a damp heap of fur; all that was left of Reepicheep. He was still breathing, but more dead than alive, gashed with innumerable wounds, one paw crushed, and, where his tail had been, a bandaged stump.

“Now, Lucy,” said Aslan.

Lucy had her diamond bottle out in a moment. Though only a drop was needed on each of Reepicheep's wounds, the wounds were so many that there was a long and anxious silence before she had finished and the Master Mouse sprang from the litter. His hand went at once to his sword hilt, with the other he twirled his whiskers. He bowed.

“Hail, Aslan!” came his shrill voice. “I have the honor—” But then he suddenly stopped.

The fact was that he still had no tail—whether that Lucy had forgotten it or that her cordial, though it could heal wounds, could not make things grow again. Reepicheep became aware of his loss as he made his bow; perhaps it altered something in his balance. He looked over his right shoulder. Failing to see his tail, he strained his neck further till he had to turn his shoulders and his whole body followed. But by that time his hind-quarters had turned too and were out of sight. Then he strained his neck looking over his shoulder again, with the same result. Only after he had turned completely round three times did he realize the dreadful truth.

“I am confounded,” said Reepicheep to Aslan. “I am completely of countenance. I must crave your indulgence for appearing in this fashion.”

“It becomes you very well, Small One,” said Aslan.

“All the same,” replied Reepicheep, “if anything could be done... Perhaps her Majesty?” and here he bowed to Lucy.

“But what do you want with a tail?” asked Aslan.

“Sir,” said the Mouse, “I can eat and sleep and die for my King without one. But a tail is the honour and glory of a Mouse.”

“I have sometimes wondered, friend,” said Aslan, “whether you do not think too much about your honour.”

“Highest of all High Kings,” said Reepicheep, “permit me to remind you that a very small size has been bestowed on us Mice, and if we did not guard our dignity, some (who weigh worth by inches) would allow themselves very unsuitable pleasantries at our expense. That is why I have been at some pains to make it known that no one who does not wish to feel this sword as near his heart as I can reach shall talk in my presence about Traps or Toasted Cheese or Candles: no, Sir—not the tallest fool in Narnia!” Here he glared very fiercely up at Wimbleweather, but the Giant, who was always a stage behind everyone else, had not yet discovered what was being talked about down at his feet, and so missed the point.

“Why have your followers all drawn their swords, may I ask?” said Aslan.

“May it please your High Majesty,” said the second Mouse, whose name was Peepiceek, “we are all waiting to cut off our own tails if our Chief must go without his. We will not bear the shame of wearing an honour which is denied to the High Mouse.”

“Ah!” roared Aslan. “You have conquered me. You have great hearts. Not for the sake of your dignity, Reepicheep, but for the love that is between you and your people, and still more for the kindness your people showed me long ago when you ate away the cords that bound me on the Stone Table (and it was then, though you have long forgotten it, that you began to be Talking Mice), you shall have your tail again.”

Before Aslan had finished speaking the new tail was in its place. Then, at Aslan's command, Peter bestowed the Knighthood of the Order of the Lion on Caspian, and Caspian, as soon as he was knighted, himself bestowed it on Trufflehunter and Trumpkin and Reepicheep, and made Doctor Cornelius his Lord Chancellor, and confirmed the Bulgy Bear in his hereditary office of Marshal of the Lists. And there was great applause.

After this the Telmarine soldiers, firmly but without taunts or blows, were taken across the ford and all put under lock and key in the town of Beruna and given beef and beer. They made a great fuss about wading the river, for they all hated and feared running water just as much as they hated and feared woods and animals. But in the end the nuisance was over: and then the nicest part of that long day began.

Lucy, sitting close to Aslan and divinely comfortable, wondered what trees were doing. At first she thought they were merely dancing; they certainly going round slowly in two circles, one from left to right and the other from right to left. Then she noticed that they kept throwing something down in the centre of both circles. Sometimes she thought they were cutting off long strands of their hair; at other times it looked as if were breaking off bits of their fingers—but, if so, they had plenty of fingers to spare and it did not hurt them. But whatever they were throwing , when it reached the ground, it became brushwood or dry sticks. Then three or four of the Red Dwarfs came forward with their tinder and set light to the pile, which first crackled, and then blazed, and roared as a woodland bonfire on midsummer night ought to do. And everyone sat down in a wide circle around it.

Then Bacchus and Silenus and the Maenads began a dance, far than the dance of the trees; not merely a dance for fun and beauty (though it was that too) but a magic dance of plenty, and where their hands touched, and where their feet fell, the feast came into existence—sides of meat that filled the grove with delicious smell, and wheaten cakes oaten cakes, honey and many-coloured sugars and cream as thick as porridge and as smooth as still water, peaches, nectarines, pomegranates, pears, grapes, strawberries, raspberries—pyramids and cataracts of fruit. Then, in great wooden cups and bowls and mazers, wreathed with ivy, came the wines; dark, thick ones like syrups of mulberry juice, and clear ones like red jellies liquefied, and yellow wines and green wines and -green and greenish-yellow.

But for the tree people different fare was provided. When Lucy saw Clodsley Shovel and his moles scuffling up the turf in various places (which Bacchus had pointed out to them) and realised that the trees were going to eat earth it gave her rather a shudder. But when she saw the earths that were actually brought to them she felt quite different. They began with a rich brown loam that looked almost exactly like chocolate; so like chocolate, in fact, that Edmund tried a piece of it, but he did not find it at all nice. When the rich loam had taken the edge off their hunger, the trees turned to an earth of the kind you see in Somerset, which is almost pink. They said it was lighter and sweeter. At the cheese stage they had a chalky soil, and then went on to delicate confections of the finest gravels powdered with choice silver sand. They drank very little wine, and it made the Hollies very talkative: for the most part they quenched their thirst with deep draughts of mingled dew and rain, flavoured with forest flowers and the airy taste of the thinnest clouds.

Thus Aslan feasted the Narnians till long after the sunset had died away, and the stars had come out; and the great fire, now hotter but less noisy, shone like a beacon in the dark woods, and the frightened Telmarines saw it from far away and wondered what it might mean. The best thing of all about this feast was that there was no breaking up or going away, but as the talk grew quieter and slower, one after another begin to nod and finally drop off to sleep with feet towards the fire good friends on either side, till at last there was silence all round the circle, and the chattering of water over stone at the Fords of Beruna could be heard once more. But all night Aslan and the Moon gazed upon each other with joyful and unblinking eyes.

Next day messengers (who were chiefly squirrels and birds) were sent all over the country with a proclamation to the scattered Telmarines—including, of course, the prisoners in Beruna. They were told that Caspian was now King and that Narnia would henceforth belong to the Talking Beasts and the Dwarfs and Dryads and Fauns and other creatures quite as much as to the men. Any who chose to stay under the new conditions might do so; but for those who did not like the idea, Aslan would provide another home. Anyone who wished to go there must come to Aslan and the Kings at the Fords of Beruna by noon on the fifth day. You may imagine that this caused plenty of head-scratching among the Telmarines. Some of them, chiefly the young ones, had, like Caspian, heard stories of the Old Days and were delighted that they had come back. They were already making friends with the creatures. These all decided to stay in Narnia. But most of the older men, especially those who had been important under Miraz, were sulky and had no wish to live in a country where they could not rule the roast. “Live here with a lot of blooming performing animals! No fear,” they said. “And ghosts too,” some added with a shudder. “That's what those there Dryads really are. It's not canny.” They were also suspicious. “I don't trust 'em,” they said. “Not with that awful Lion and all. He won't keep his claws off us long, you'll see.” But then they were equally suspicious of his offer to give them a new home. “Take us off to his den and eat us one by one most likely,” they muttered. And the more they talked to one another the sulkier and more suspicious they became. But on the appointed day more than half of them turned up.

At one end of the glade Aslan had caused to be set up two stakes of wood, higher than a man's head and about three feet apart. A third, and lighter, piece of wood was bound across them at the top, uniting them, so that the whole thing looked like a doorway from nowhere into nowhere. In front of this stood Aslan himself with Peter on his right and Caspian on his left. Grouped round them were Susan and Lucy, Trumpkin and Trufflehunter, the Lord Cornelius, Glenstorm, Reepicheep, and others. The children and the Dwarfs had made good use of the royal wardrobes in what had been the castle of Miraz and was now the castle of Caspian, and what with silk and cloth of gold, with snowy linen glancing through slashed sleeves, with silver mail shirts and jewelled sword-hilts, with gilt helmets and feathered bonnets, they were almost too bright to look at. Even the beasts wore rich chains about their necks. Yet nobody's eyes were on them or the children. The living and strokable gold of Aslan's mane outshone them all. The rest of the Old Narnians stood down each side of the glade. At the far end stood the Telmarines. The sun shone brightly and pennants fluttered in the light wind.

“Men of Telmar,” said Aslan, “you who seek a new land, hear my words. I will send you all to your own country, which I know and you do not.”

“We don't remember Telmar. We don't know where it is. We don't know what it is like,” grumbled the Telmarines.

“You came into Narnia out of Telmar,” said Aslan. “But you came into Telmar from another place. You do not belong to this world at all. You came hither, certain generations ago, out of that same world to which the High King Peter belongs.”

At this, half the Telmarines began whimpering, “There you are. Told you so. He's going to kill us all, send us right out of the world,” and the other half began throwing out their chests and slapping one another on the back and whispering, “There you are. Might have guessed we didn't belong to this place with all its queer, nasty, unnatural creatures. We're of royal blood, you'll see.” And even Caspian and Cornelius and the children turned to Aslan with looks of amazement on their faces.

“Peace,” said Aslan in the low voice which was nearest to his growl. The earth seemed to shake a little and every living thing in the grove became still as stone.

“You, Sir Caspian,” said Aslan, “might have known that you could be no true King of Narnia unless, like the Kings of old, you were a son of Adam and came from the world of Adam's sons. And so you are. Many years ago in that world, in a deep sea of that world which is called the South Sea, a shipload of pirates were driven by storm on an island. And there they did as pirates would: killed the natives and took the native women for wives, and made palm wine, and drank and were drunk, and lay in the shade of the palm trees, and woke up and quarrelled, and sometimes killed one another. And in one of these frays six were put to flight by the rest and fled with their women into the centre of the island and up a mountain, and went, as they thought, into a cave to hide. But it was one of the magical places of that world, one of the chinks or chasms between that world and this. There were many chinks or chasms between worlds in old times, but they have grown rarer. This was one of the last: I do not say the last. And so they fell, or rose, or blundered, or dropped right through, and found themselves in this world, in the Land of Telmar which was then unpeopled. But why it was unpeopled is a long story: I will not tell it now. And in Telmar their descendants lived and became a and proud people; and after many generations there was a famine Telmar and they invaded Narnia, which was then in some disorder (but that also would be a long story), and conquered it and ruled it. Do you mark all this well, King Caspian?”

“I do indeed, Sir,” said Caspian. “I was wishing that I came of a more honourable lineage.”

“You come of the Lord Adam and the Lady Eve,” said Aslan. “And that is both honor enough to erect the head of the poorest beggar, and shame enough to bow the shoulders of the greatest emperor on earth. Be content.”

Caspian bowed.

“And now,” said Aslan, “you men and women of Telmar, will you go back to that island in the world of men from which your fathers first came? It is no bad place. The race of those pirates who first found it has died out, and it is without inhabitants. There are good wells of fresh water, and fruitful soil, and timber for building, and fish in the lagoons; and the other men of that world have not yet discovered it. The chasm is open for your return; but this I must warn you, that once you have gone through, it will close behind you forever. There will be no more commerce between the worlds by that door.”

There was silence for a moment. Then a burly, decent-looking fellow among the Telmarine soldiers pushed forward and said:

“Well, I'll take the offer.”

“It is well chosen,” said Aslan. “And because you have spoken first, strong magic is upon you. Your future in that world shall be good. Come forth.”

The man, now a little pale, came forward. Aslan and his court drew aside, leaving him free access to the empty doorway of the stakes.

“Go through it, my son,” said Aslan, bending towards him and touching the man's nose with his own. As soon as the Lion's breath came about him, a new look came into the man's eyes—startled, but not unhappy—as if he were trying to remember something. Then he squared his shoulders and walked into the Door.

Everyone's eyes were fixed on him. They saw the three pieces of wood, and through them the trees and grass and sky of Narnia. They saw the man between the doorposts: then, in one second, he had vanished utterly.

From the other end of the glade the remaining Telmarines set up a wailing. “Ugh! What's happened to him? Do you mean to murder us? We won't go that way.” And then one of the clever Telmarines said:

“We don't see any other world through those sticks. If you want us to believe in it, why doesn't one of you go? All your own friends are keeping well away from the sticks.”

Instantly Reepicheep stood forward and bowed. “If my example can be of any service, Aslan,” he said, “I will take eleven mice through that arch at your bidding without a moment's delay.”

“Nay, little one,” said Aslan, laying his velvety paw ever so lightly on Reepicheep's head. “They would do dreadful things to you in that world. They would show you at fairs. It is others who must lead.”

“Come on,” said Peter suddenly to Edmund and Lucy. “Our time's up.”

“What do you mean?” said Edmund.

“This way,” said Susan, who seemed to know all about it. “Back into the trees. We've got to change.”

“Change what?” asked Lucy.

“Our clothes, of course,” said Susan. “Nice fools we'd look on the platform of an English station in these.”

“But our other things are at Caspian's castle,” said Edmund.

“No, they're not,” said Peter, still leading the way into the thickest . “They're all here. They were brought down in bundles this morning. It's all arranged.”

“Was that what Aslan was talking to you and Susan about this morning?” asked Lucy.

“Yes—that and other things,” said Peter, his face very solemn. “I can't tell it to you all. There were things he wanted to say to Su and me because we're not coming back to Narnia.”

“Never?” cried Edmund and Lucy in dismay.

“Oh, you two are,” answered Peter. “At least, from what he said, I'm pretty sure he means you to get back some day. But not Su and me. He says we're getting too old.”

“Oh, Peter,” said Lucy. “What awful bad luck. Can you bear it?”

“Well, I think I can,” said Peter. “It's all rather different from what I thought. You'll understand when it comes to your last time. But, quick, here are our things.”

It was odd, and not very nice, to take off their royal clothes and to come back in their school things (not very fresh now) into that great assembly. One or two of the nastier Telmarines jeered. But the other creatures all cheered and rose up in honour of Peter the High King, and Queen Susan of the Horn, and King Edmund and Queen Lucy. There were affectionate and (on Lucy's part) tearful farewells with all their old friends—animal kisses, and hugs from Bulgy Bears, and hands wrung by Trumpkin, and a last tickly, whiskerish embrace with Trufflehunter. And of course Caspian offered the Horn back to Susan and of course Susan told him to keep it. And then, wonderfully and terribly, it was farewell to Aslan himself, and Peter took his place with Susan's hands on his shoulders and Edmund's on hers and Lucy's on his and the first of the Telmarine's on Lucy's, and so in a long line they moved forward to the Door. After that came a moment which is hard to describe, for the children seemed to be seeing three things at once. One was the mouth of a cave opening into the glaring green and blue of an island in the Pacific, where all the Telmarines find themselves the moment they were through the Door. The second was a glade in Narnia, the faces of Dwarfs and Beasts, the deep eyes of Aslan, and the white patches on the Badger's cheeks. But the third (which rapidly swallowed up the other two) was the gray, gravelly surface of a platform in a country station, and a seat with luggage round it, where they were all sitting as if they had never moved from it—a little flat and dreary for a moment after all they had been through, but also, unexpectedly, nice in its own way, what with the familiar railway smell and the English sky and the summer term before them.

“Well!” said Peter. “We have had a time.”

“Bother!” said Edmund. “I've left my new torch in Narnia.”
