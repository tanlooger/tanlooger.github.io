PAST ELEVEN!









关于可怜的维特的故事，凡是我能找到的，我都努力搜集起来，呈献在诸位面前了；我知道，诸位是会感谢我的。对于他的精神和品格，诸位定将产生钦慕与爱怜；对于他的命运，诸位都不免一洒自己的同情泪。

而你，正感受着与他同样烦恼的善良人呵，就从他的痛苦中汲取安慰，并让这本薄薄的小书做你的朋友吧，要是你由于命运的不济或自身的过错，已不可能有更知己的人的话。





第一编


一七七一年五月四日


我多高兴啊，我终于走了！好朋友，人心真不知是个什么东西！我离开了你，离开了自己相爱相亲、朝夕不舍的人，竟然会感到高兴！我知道你会原谅我。命运偏偏让我结识了另外几个人，不正是为了来扰乱我这颗心么？可怜的蕾奥诺莱！但我是没有错的。她妹妹的非凡魅力令我赏心悦目，却使她可怜的心中产生了痛苦，这难道怪得着我？然而——我就真的完全没有错吗？难道我不曾助长她的感情？难道当她自自然然地流露真情时，我不曾沾沾自喜，并和大家一起拿这原本不可笑的事情来取笑她么？难道我？……唉，这人啊真是一种惯会自怨自责的怪物！而我，亲爱的朋友，我向你保证，我一定改弦更张，绝不再像已往那样，总把命运加给我们的一点儿痛苦拿来反复咀嚼回味，而要乐享眼前，过去了的就让它过去。是的，好朋友，诚如你所说：人们要是不这么没完没了地运用想象力去唤起昔日痛苦的回忆——上帝才知道为什么把人造成这个样子——，而是多多考虑考虑如何挨过眼前的话，人间的痛苦本来就会少一些的。

劳驾告诉我母亲，我将尽力料理好她那件事，并尽快回信给她。我已见过我姑妈了，发现她远非我们在家里所讲的那么个刁婆子，而是一位热心快肠的夫人。我向她转达了我母亲对于扣下一部分遗产未分的不满；她则对我说明了这样做的种种理由和原因，以及要在什么条件下，她才准备全部交出来，也就是说比我们要求的还多……简单讲，我现在还不想具体谈什么；请转告我母亲，一切都会好起来的。就在这件小小的事情上，好朋友，我再次发现误解与成见，往往会在世界上铸成比诡诈与恶意更多的过错。至少可以肯定，后两者要罕见一些。

再就是我在此间非常愉快。这个乐园一般的地方，它的岑寂正好是医治我这颗心的灵丹妙药；还有眼前的大好春光，它的温暖已充满我这颗时常寒栗的心。每一株树，每一排篱笆上，都是繁花盛开；人真想变成一只金甲虫，到那馥郁的香海中去遨游，去尽情地吸露吮蜜。

城市本身并不舒适，四郊的自然环境却说不出的美妙。也许这才打动了已故的M伯爵，把他的花园建在一座小丘上。类似的小丘在城外交错纵横，千姿百态，美不胜收，丘与丘之间还构成一道道幽静宜人的峡谷。花园布局单纯，一进门便可感觉出绘制蓝图的并非某位高明的园艺家，而是一颗渴望独享幽寂的敏感的心。对于这座废园的故主人，我在那间业已破败的小亭中洒下了不少追怀的眼泪；这小亭子是他生前最爱待的地方，如今也成了我流连忘返的所在。不久我便会成为这花园的主人；没几天工夫看园人已对我产生好感，再说我搬进去也亏待不了他。





五月十日


一种奇妙的欢愉充溢着我的整个灵魂，使它甜蜜得就像我专心一意地享受着的那些春晨。这地方好似专为与我有同样心境的人创造的；我在此独自享受生的乐趣。我真幸福啊，朋友，我完全沉湎在对宁静生活的感受中，结果我的艺术便荒废了。眼下我无法作画，哪怕一笔也不成；尽管如此，我现在却比任何时候都更配称一个伟大的画家。每当我周围的可爱峡谷霞气蒸腾，杲杲的太阳悬挂在林梢，将它的光芒这儿那儿地偷射进幽暗密林的圣地中来时，我便躺卧在飞泉侧畔的茂草里，紧贴地面观察那千百种小草，感觉到叶茎间有个扰攘的小小世界——这数不尽也说不清的形形色色的小虫子、小蛾子——离我的心更近了，于是我感受到按自身模样创造我们的全能上帝的存在，感受到将我们托付于永恒的欢乐海洋之中的博爱天父的嘘息，我的朋友！随后，每当我的视野变得朦胧，周围的世界和整个天空都像我爱人的形象似的安息在我心中时，我便常常产生一种急切的向往，啊，要是我能把它再现出来，把这如此丰富、如此温暖地活在我心中的形象，如神仙似的呵口气吹到纸上，使其成为我灵魂的镜子，正如我的灵魂是无所不在的上帝的镜子一样，这该有多好啊！——我的朋友！——然而我真去做时却会招致毁灭，我将在壮丽自然的威力底下命断魂销。





五月十二日


不知是附近一带有愚弄人的精灵呢，还是我自己异想天开，竟觉得周围的一切都如乐园中一般美好。就在城外不远有一口井，我真像人鱼美露西娜[1]和她的姊妹似的迷上了它。——下了一座小丘，来到一顶凉棚前，再走下二十步石阶，便可见大理石岩缝中涌出一泓清澈的泉水。那绕井而筑的矮墙，那浓荫匝地的大树，那井泉周围的清凉，这一切都有一股诱人的力量，令人怦然心悸。我没有一天不去那儿坐上个把小时。常有城里的姑娘们来打水，这是一种最平凡又最必要的工作，古时候连公主们也亲自做过的。每当我坐在那儿，古代宗法社会的情景便活现在我眼前，我仿佛看见老祖宗们全聚在井泉边，会友的会友，联姻的联姻；而在井泉四周的空中，却飞舞着无数善良的精灵。呵，谁若无此同感，谁就必定从不曾在夏日的长途跋涉后，把令人神怡气爽的清泉啜饮。





五月十三日


你问需不需要寄书给我？——好朋友，我求你看在上帝分上，千万别再拿它们来烦扰我吧。我不愿意再被指导，被鼓舞，被激励；我这颗心本身已够不平静的了。我需要的是催眠曲；而我的荷马[2]，就是一首很长很长的催眠曲。为了使自己沸腾的血液冷静下来，我常常轻轻哼这支曲子；要知道你还不曾见过任何东西，像我这颗心似的反复无常，变化莫测哟，我的爱友！关于这点我对你毋须解释；你不是已无数次地见过我从忧郁一变而为喜悦，从感伤一变而为兴奋，因而担惊受怕过么？我自己也把我这颗心当作一个生病的孩子，对他有求必应。别把这话讲出去，传开了有人会骂我的。





五月十五日


本地的老乡们已经认识我，喜欢我，特别是那班孩子们。起初，我去接近他们，友好地向他们问这问那，他们中有几个还当我是拿他们开心，便想粗暴地打发走我。我并不气恼；相反只对一个我已多次发现的情况，有了切身的体会：就是某些稍有地位的人，总对老百姓采取冷淡疏远的态度，似乎一接近就会失去什么来着；同时又有一些轻薄仔和捣蛋鬼，跑来装出一副纡尊降贵的模样，骨子里却想叫穷百姓更好地尝尝他们那傲慢的滋味。

我清楚地知道，我与他们不是一样的人，也不可能是一样的人；但是，我认为谁如果觉得自己有必要疏远所谓下等人以保持尊严，那他就跟一个因为怕失败而躲避敌人的懦夫一样可耻。

最近我去井边，碰到一个年轻使女，见她把自己的水瓮搁在最低的一级台阶上，正在那儿东瞅瞅，西望望，等着同伴来帮助她把水瓮顶到头上去。我走下台阶，望着她。

“要我帮助你吗，姑娘？”我问。

她顿时满脸通红。

“噢不，先生！”她道。

“别客气！”

她放正头上的垫环，我便帮她顶好水瓮。她道过谢，登上台阶走了。





五月十七日


我已认识各式各样的人，但能做伴的朋友却还一个没交上。我不知道自己有什么吸引人的地方，他们那么多人都喜欢我，愿意与我亲近；而唯其如此，我又为我们只能同走一小段路而感到难过。你要是问这儿的人怎么样，我只能回答：跟到处一样！人类嘛都是一个模子铸出来的。多数人为了生活，不得不忙忙碌碌，花去大部分时间；剩下一点点余暇却使他们犯起愁来，非想方设法打发掉不可。这就是人类的命运啊！

此地的人倒挺善良！我常常忘记自己的身份，和他们一起共享人类还保留下来的一些欢乐，或围坐在一桌丰盛的筵席前开怀畅饮，纵情谈笑，或及时举行一次郊游，一次舞会。等等这些，都对我的心境产生了很好的效果；只可惜偶尔我不免想起，我身上还有许多其他能力未能发挥，正在发霉衰朽，不得不小心翼翼地收藏起来。唉，一想到这一点，我的整个心就缩紧了。——可有什么办法！遭人误解，这便是我们这种人的命运。

可叹呵，我青年时代的女友已经去世！可叹呵，我曾与她相识！——我真想说：“你是个傻瓜！你追求着在人世间找不到的东西。”可是，我确曾有过她，感到过她的心，她的伟大的灵魂；和她在一起，我自己仿佛也增加了价值，因为我成了我所能成为的最充实的人。仁慈的主呵！那时难道有我心灵中的任何一种能力不曾发挥么？我在她面前，不是能把我的心用以拥抱宇宙的奇异情感，整个儿抒发出来么？我与她的交往，不就是一幅不断用柔情、睿智、戏谑等等织成的锦缎么？这一切上面，全留下了天才的印记呀！——唉，她先我而生，也先我而去。我将永远不会忘记她，不会忘记她那坚定的意志，不会忘记她那非凡的耐性。

几天前，我见过一个叫V的青年，为人坦率，模样儿长得也挺俊。他刚从大学毕业，虽说还不以才子自居，却总以为比别人多几分学问。我从一些事情上感觉出，他人倒勤奋，一句话，也有相当知识吧。当他听说我会画画，还懂希腊文——这在此间可算两大奇技——便跑来找我，把他渊博的学识一股脑儿抖搂了出来，从巴托[3]谈到伍德[4]，从德·俾勒[5]谈到温克尔曼[6]，并要我相信他已把苏尔泽[7]的《原理》的第一卷通读过一遍，他还收藏有一部海纳[8]研究古典文化的手稿呢。对他的话我未置一词。

我还结识了一位很不错的男子，是侯爵在本城的总管，为人忠厚坦诚。据说，谁要看见他和他的几个孩子在一块儿，谁都会打心眼儿里高兴；尤其对他的大女儿，人家更是赞不绝口。他已邀请我上他家去，我也打算尽早前往拜访。他住在侯爵的猎庄上，离城约一个半小时路程；自妻子亡故以后，他住在城里和法院里都心头难受，便获准迁到猎庄去了。

此外，我还碰着几个怪人，一举一动都叫你受不了，尤其是他们的那股子亲热劲儿。

再谈吧！这封信你一定喜欢，它完完全全是纪实。





五月二十二日


人生如梦，这是许多人早已有过的感受；而我呢，到哪里也会生此同感。我常常看见人的创造力和洞察力都受到局限；我常常看见人的一切活动，都是为了满足某些需要，而这些需要除去延长我们可怜的生存，本身又毫无任何目的；临了，我还发现，人从某些探索结果中得到的自慰，其实只是一种梦幻者的怠惰，正如一个囚居斗室的人，把四面墙壁统统画上五彩缤纷的形象与光辉灿烂的景物一般——这一切，威廉哟，都令我哑口无言。我只好回到自己的内心，去发现一个世界！为此又更多地依靠预感与朦胧的渴望，而不依靠创造与活力。这一来，一切对于我的感官都是游移不定的；我也如在梦里似的，继续对着世界微笑。

大大小小的学究们一致断定，小孩儿是不知何所欲求的；岂止小孩儿，成人们还不是在地球上东奔西闯，同样不清楚自己打哪儿来，往哪儿去，同样干起事来漫无目的，同样受着饼干、蛋糕和桦木鞭子的支配。这个道理谁都不肯相信，但我想却是显而易见。

因为我知道你听了会说些什么，我乐于向你承认：我认为，那些能像小孩儿似的懵懵懂懂过日子的人，他们是最幸福的。他们也跟小孩儿一样拖着自己的布娃娃四处跑，把它们的衣服脱掉又穿上，穿上又脱掉，不然就乖乖儿围着妈妈藏甜点心的抽屉转来转去；终于如愿以偿了，便满嘴满腮地大嚼起来，一边嚷嚷着：还要！还要！——这才是幸福的人啰。还有一种人，他们给自己的无聊勾当以至欲念想出种种漂亮称呼，美其名曰为人类造福的伟大事业；他们也是幸福的。——愿上帝赐福给这样的人吧！可是，谁要虚怀若谷，正视这一切将会有怎样的结果；谁要能看见每一个殷实市民如何循规蹈矩，善于将自己的小小花园变成天国，而不幸者也甘负重荷，继续气喘吁吁地行进在人生的道路上，并且人人同样渴望多见一分钟阳光——是的，谁能认识到和看到这些，他也会心安理得，自己为自己创造一个世界，并且为生而为人感到幸福。这样，他尽管处处受着限制，内心却永远怀着甜滋滋的自由感觉：因为只要他愿意，他随时可以离开这座监狱。





五月二十六日


你一向了解我的居住习惯，只要有个安静角落，便可建所小屋住下来，其他条件概不讲究。在此地我也发现了这么个对我有吸引力的所在。

它离城约一小时路程，地名叫瓦尔海姆[9]，坐落在一个山岗旁，地势颇为有趣。沿岗子上的小路往村里走，整个山谷尽收眼底。房东是位上了年纪的妇人，殷勤豁达，她斟出葡萄酒、啤酒和咖啡来请我喝。但最令我满意的，是两株大菩提树，只见它们挺立在教堂前的小坝子上，枝叶扶疏，绿荫映罩，四周围着农家的住屋、仓房和场院。如此幽静、如此宜人的所在，实不易得，我便常常把房里的小桌儿和椅子搬到坝子上，在那儿饮我的咖啡，读我的荷马。头一次，在一个风和日暖的午后，我信步来到菩提树下，发现这地方异常幽静。其时人们全下地了，只有一个约莫四岁的小男孩，盘腿席地坐在坝子上，怀中还搂着个半岁光景的幼儿；他用自己的双腿和胸部，给自己的弟弟做成了一把安乐椅。他静悄悄地坐着，一对黑眼睛却活泼泼地瞅来瞅去。我让眼前的情景迷住了，便坐在对面的一张犁头上，兴致勃勃地画起这小哥儿俩来。我把他们身后的篱笆、仓门以及几个破车轱辘也画上了，全都依照本来的顺序；一小时后，我便完成了一幅布局完美、构图有趣的素描，其中没有掺进我本人一丁点儿的东西。这个发现增强了我今后皈依自然的决心。只有自然，才是无穷丰富；只有自然，才能造就大艺术家。对于成法定则，人们尽可以讲许多好话，正如对于市民社会，也可以致这样那样的颂词一般。诚然，一个按法成定则培养的画家，决不至于绘出拙劣乏味的作品，就像一个奉法唯谨的小康市民，决不至于成为一个讨厌的邻居或者大恶棍；但是，另一方面，所有的清规戒律，不管你怎么讲，统统都会破坏我们对自然的真实感受，真实表现！你会讲：“这太过分啦！规则仅仅起着节制与剔除枝蔓这样一些作用罢了！”——好朋友，我给你打个比方好吗？比如谈恋爱。一个青年倾心于一个姑娘，整天都厮守在她身边，耗尽了全部精力和财产，只为时时刻刻向她表示，他对她是一片至诚。谁知却出来个庸人，出来个小官僚什么的，对他讲：“我说小伙子呀！恋爱嘛是人之常情，不过你也必须跟常人似的爱得有个分寸。喏，把你的时间分配分配，一部分用于工作，休息的时候才去陪爱人。好好计算一下你的财产吧，除去生活必需的，剩下来我不反对你拿去买件礼物送她，不过也别太经常，在她过生日或命名日时送就够了。”——他要听了这忠告，便又多了一位有为青年，我本人都乐于向任何一位侯爵举荐他，让他充任侯爵的僚属；可是他的爱情呢，也就完啦，倘使他是个艺术家，他的艺术也完啦。朋友们啊！你们不是奇怪天才的巨流为什么难得激涨汹涌，奔腾澎湃，掀起使你们惊心动魄的狂涛么？——亲爱的朋友，那是因为在这巨流的两边岸上，住着一些四平八稳的老爷，他们担心自己的亭园、花畦、苗圃会被洪水冲毁，为了防患于未然，已及时地筑好堤，挖好沟了。





五月二十七日


我看我讲得高兴，只顾打比方，发议论，竟忘了把那两个孩子后来的情况告诉你。我在犁头上坐了将近两个小时，完全沉醉在作画里；关于当时的心情，昨天我已零零碎碎向你谈了一些。傍晚，一位青年女子手腕挎着个小篮子，向着一直坐在坝子上没动的小孩子走过来，老远就嚷着：“菲利普斯，真乖啊！”——她向我问好，我说了谢谢，随后站起来，走过去，问她是不是孩子的妈妈。她回答“是”，一边给大孩子半个白面包，一边抱起小孩子，满怀母爱地亲吻着。——“我把小弟弟交给我的菲利普斯带，”她说，“自己跟老大一块儿进城买面包、糖和熬粥的砂锅去了。”——在她那掀开了盖子的提篮中，我看见了这些东西。——“我打算晚上给咱汉斯（这是最小那个孩子的名字）熬点粥。我那老大是个淘气鬼，昨儿个跟菲利普斯争粥脚子吃，把锅给砸啦。”——我问她老大现在何处，她回答在草地上放鹅；然而话音未了，他已一蹦一跳地跑来，给他大弟弟带来了一根榛树鞭子。我继续和妇人闲聊，得知她是一位教员的闺女，丈夫为着承继一位堂兄的遗产，出门上瑞士去了。——“人家想骗他，”她说，“连信都不给他回，所以只好亲自跑一趟。他一点消息也没有，但愿别出什么事才好呵。”——和妇人分别时，我心情颇沉重，便给了小孩儿们一人一枚银毫子，此外再给了一枚给他们的妈妈，请她下次进城时买个白面包回来，拿给最小的孩子和粥一块儿吃。随后便分了手。

告诉你，好朋友，每当我心烦意乱的时候，只要看见这样一个心平气和的人，我便可安定下来。这种人乐天知命，过一天是一天，看见树叶落时，只会想“冬天快到啦”，除此就别无思虑。

从那次以后，我常常出去。小孩子们都和我混熟了，在我喝咖啡时得到糖吃，傍晚与我一块儿分享黄油面包和酸牛奶。每逢礼拜天，我总给他们银毫子，即使做完弥撒我没回家，我也请房东太太代为分发给他们。

他们都信赖我，什么话都对我讲。每逢村里有更多小孩聚到我这儿来，玩得高兴，有什么愿望都径直表露的时候，我更是快活得什么似的。

孩子的母亲总担心“他们会打搅少爷”；我费了老大的劲，才打消了她的疑虑。





五月三十日


不久前我对你讲的关于作画的想法，显然也适用于写诗；诗人要做的只是发现美好的事物，并大胆地表达出来。此话说来诚然简单，含义却很深长。今天我见了一个场面，只要照实写下来，便可成为世间最美的一首田园诗。然而诗也罢，场面也罢，田园牧歌也罢，统统有什么意义呢？难道我们亲身经历自然现象还不够，还非得来一个依样画葫芦不可么？

听了这段开场白，要是你指望后面会有什么高见宏论，那你又上当了。使我这么大发感慨的，仅仅是一个青年农民罢了。——我跟往常一样，会讲得不好；而你也跟往常一样，我想，会认为我夸大其词。还是在瓦尔海姆，总是在瓦尔海姆；在这个地方，稀罕事可算层出不穷哩。

有一伙人聚在坝子里的菩提树下喝咖啡。我不太喜欢他们，便找个借口坐到了一边。

这当儿，从旁边的农舍中走出来个青年，在那里修理我曾经画过的那张犁。他的模样给我的印象不错，我于是和他拉话，打听起他的境况来。不多时，我俩已经熟了，而且按我与这类人打交道的习惯，立刻便无话不谈。他告诉我，他在一位寡妇家里当长工，主人家待他非常好。提起他的女东家，他就滔滔不绝，满口称赞，我马上看出，他对她已倾倒得五体投地，她已不很年轻，他说，由于受过丈夫的虐待，不准备再嫁人了。从他的言语间，我明显感觉出，她在他眼里是那样的美，那样的动人，他非常非常希望她能选中他，使他有机会帮她抹去她那前夫所留下的遗恨。要对你描述出这个人的倾慕、痴情和忠心，必须逐字逐句重复他的话。对，还必须具有最伟大的诗人的才分，才能绘声绘色地描述出他那神态表情，他那悦耳的嗓音，他那火热的目光。不！没有任何语言，能够表现出他的整个内心与外表所蕴藏的柔情；经我重述，一切都会变得淡而无味了。特别令人感动的是，他那样担心我会对他和她的关系产生想法，怀疑她的行为端正。当他讲到她的容貌，讲到她那虽已不再具有青春的诱惑力，但却强烈吸引着他的身段时，他的神情更是感人，我唯有在自己心灵深处去体会，去重温。如此纯洁的爱恋，如此纯洁的渴慕，我在一生中从未见过，是的，也许可以讲，连想也不曾想过，梦也不曾梦过。请别骂我，要是我告诉你，当我回忆起这个真挚无邪的恋人来时，我自己心中也热血沸腾，眼前便随时出现一个忠贞妩媚的倩影，仿佛我也跟着燃烧起来，害起了如饥似渴的相思。

我现在渴望尽快见到她；或者不，仔细考虑之下，我想避免和她见面。通过他情人的青眼去看她，岂不更好；她要真来到我面前，也许就不再如我眼下想象的样子，我又何必破坏这美的形象呢？





六月十六日


我干吗久不给你写信？——你提这个问题，想必也变成一位老学究了吧！你应该猜想到，我过得很好，好得简直……干脆告诉你吧，我认识了一个人，她使我无心他顾了。我已经……叫我怎么说好呢。

要把认识这个最可爱的人儿的经过有条不紊地告诉你，在我将是困难的。我快乐而又幸福，因此不能成为一位好小说家。

一位天使！——得！谁都这么称呼自己的心上人，不是吗？可我无法告诉你她有多么完美，为什么完美；一句话，她完全俘虏了我的心。

那么聪敏，却那么单纯；那么坚毅，却那么善良；那么勤谨，却那么娴静……

我讲的全是些废话，空空洞洞，俗不可耐，丝毫没反映出她的本来面目。等下次……不，不等下次。我现在立刻对你讲她。我现在要不讲，就永远别想讲了。要知道，我坦白告诉你，在开始写这封信以后，我已经三次差点儿扔下笔，让人给马装上鞍子，骑着跑出去了。不过我今天早上已起过誓不出去，只是仍时不时地跑到窗前，看太阳还有多高，是不是……

我到底没能克制住自己，我非去她那儿不可啊。这会儿我又坐下来，一边吃黄油面包当夜宵，一边给你，威廉，继续写信。当我看见她在那一群活泼的孩子中间，在她的八个弟妹中间，我的心是何等欣喜啊！

倘使我继续这么往下写，到头来你仍然会摸不着头脑的。听着，我要强迫自己详详细细地把一切告诉你。

不久前我说过，我认识了总管S先生，他曾邀请我尽快去他的隐居所，或者说他的小王国做客。我呢，却把这件事拖了下来；要不是一个偶然的机会，让我发现了那密藏在幽谷中的珍宝，我没准儿永远也不会去。

此间的年轻人在乡下举办一次舞会，我也欣然前往参加。事前，我答应了本地一位心地善良、长相尚好、除此便不怎么样的姑娘的邀请，并已商定由我雇一辆马车，带着我这舞伴和她表姐一起出城去聚会地点，顺道儿还接一接S家的夏绿蒂。

“您将认识一位漂亮小姐哪。”当我们的马车穿过砍伐过的森林向猎庄驶去的时候，我的舞伴开了口。

“不过您得当心，”她的表姐却说，“可别迷上了她呀！”

“为什么？”我问。

“她已经许了人，”我的舞伴回答，“一个挺不错的小伙子，眼下不在家，他的父亲去世了，他去料理后事，顺便谋个体面的职务。”

这个消息在我听来是无所谓的。

我们到达猎庄大门前的时候，太阳还有一刻钟光景便要下山了。其时天气闷热，姑娘们都表示担心，说那四周天边的灰白色云朵要是酿出一场暴雨来，那可就煞风景了。我摆出一副精通气象学的架势来安慰她们，其实自己心中也开始预想到，我们的舞会将要扫兴的。

我下了马车，一名女仆赶到大门口来请我们稍等一会儿，说小姐她马上就来。我穿过院子，走向那建筑得很讲究的住屋。就在我上了台阶、跨进门去的当儿，一幕我见所未见的最动人的情景，映入了我的眼帘。在前厅里有六个孩子，从十一岁到两岁，大的大，小的小，全都围着一个模样娟秀、身材适中、穿着雅致的白裙、袖口和胸前系着粉红色蝴蝶结儿的年轻女子。她手里拿着一个黑面包，按周围弟妹的不同年龄与胃口，依次切给他们大小不等的一块；她在把面包递给每一个孩子时都那么慈爱，小家伙们也自自然然地说一声：谢谢！不等面包切下来，全都高擎着小手在那儿等。而眼下，又一起津津有味地吃起来，一边按照各自不同的性格，有的飞跑到大门边，有的慢吞吞地踱过去，好看一看客人们，看一看他们的绿蒂姐姐将要乘着出门去的那辆马车。

“请原谅，”她说，“劳您驾跑进来，并让姑娘们久等。我刚才换衣服和料理不在家时要做的一些事情，结果忘了给孩子们吃晚餐。他们可是除我以外谁切的面包也不肯吃啊。”

我略微客套了两句；我的整个心灵都让她的形象、她的声音、她的举止给占据了。直到她跑进里屋去取手套和扇子，我才从惊喜中回过神儿来。小家伙们都远远地站在一旁瞅着我；我这时便朝年龄最小，模样儿也最俊的一个走过去，可他却想退开。

“路易斯，跟这位哥哥握手。”这当儿绿蒂正好走进门来，说道。

小男孩于是大大方方把手伸给我，我忍不住热烈吻了他，虽然他那小鼻头儿上挂着鼻涕。

“哥哥？”我问，同时把手伸给她，“您真认为，我有配作您亲眷这个福分么？”

“噢，”她嫣然一笑，说，“我们的表兄弟多着哩。要是您是其中顶讨厌的一个，那我就遗憾啦。”

临走，她又嘱咐她的大妹妹索菲——一个约莫十一岁的小姑娘，好好照看弟妹，并在爸爸骑马出去散心回来时向他问安。她还叮咛小家伙们要听索菲姐姐的话，把索菲当作就是她一般。几个孩子满口答应；可有个满头金发、六岁光景的小机灵鬼却嚷起来：“她不是你，绿蒂姐姐，我们更喜欢你嘛。”

这其间，最大的两个男孩已经爬到马车上；经我代为求情，她才答应他俩一块儿乘坐到林子边，条件是保证不打不闹，手一定扶牢。

我们刚一坐稳，姑娘们便寒暄开了，并品评起彼此的穿着，特别是帽子来，还对即将举行的舞会，作了一番挑剔。正讲在兴头上，绿蒂已招呼停车，让她的两个弟弟下去。小哥儿俩却要求再亲亲她的手。大的可能有十五岁，在吻姐姐的手时彬彬有礼；小的则毛毛躁躁，漫不经心。绿蒂让他俩再次问候小弟妹们，随后车又开了。

表姐问，绿蒂有没有把新近寄给她的那本书读完。

“没有，”绿蒂说，“这本书我不喜欢，您可以拿回去了。上次那本也不见得好看多少。”

我问是怎样的书，她回答了我，令我大吃一惊……[10]我从她的所有谈吐中都发现她是那样有个性；每听她讲一句，我都从她的脸庞上发现了新的魅力，新的精神光辉。渐渐地，这张脸庞似乎更加愉快和舒展了，因为她感觉到，我是理解她的。

“当我年纪还小的时候，”她说，“我什么也不爱读，就爱读小说。礼拜天总躲在一个角落里，整个心分担着燕妮[11]姑娘的喜怒哀乐。上帝知道我当时有多幸福呵。我不否认，这类书对我仍有某些吸引力。可是，既然眼下我很少有工夫再读书，那我读的书就必须十分对我的口味。我最喜欢的作家必须让我能找到我的世界，他书里写的仿佛就是我本人，使我感到那么有趣，那么亲切，恰似在我自己家里的生活，它虽然还不像天堂那么美好，整个看来却已是一种不可言喻的幸福的源泉。”

听了这番议论，我好不容易才隐藏住自己的激动。这局面自然没有维持多久，因为一听她顺便提到了《威克菲牧师传》[12]以及……[13]竟谈得那样有真知灼见，我便忘乎所以，把自己知道的和盘托出，讲啊讲啊，直到绿蒂转过头去和另外两位姑娘搭讪，我才发现她俩瞪大了眼睛，在那儿坐冷板凳。表姐还不止一次地对我做出嗤之以鼻的样子，我也全不介意。

话题转到了跳舞的乐趣上。

“就算这种爱好是个缺点吧，”绿蒂说，“我也乐于向你们承认，我不知道有什么比跳舞更好的了。有时候我心头不痛快，可只要在我那架破钢琴上弹支英国乡村舞曲，便一切都忘了。”

谈话间，我尽情地欣赏她那黑色的明眸：我整个的魂魄，都让她那活泼伶俐的小嘴与鲜艳爽朗的脸庞给摄走了！她隽永的谈吐完全迷醉了我，对于她用些什么词我也就顾不上听了！——你该想象得出当时的情形，因为你了解我。简单讲，当马车平稳地停住在聚会的别墅前，我走下车来已经像个梦游者似的，神魂颠倒，周围朦胧中的世界对我已不复存在，就连从上面灯火辉煌的大厅中迎面飘来的阵阵乐声，我也充耳不闻。

两位先生，奥德兰和某某，——谁记得清这许多名字啊！——一位是表姐的舞伴，一位是绿蒂的舞伴，赶到车边来迎接我们，各人挽住了自己的女友。我也领着我的舞伴，朝上面大厅走去。

大伙儿成双成对地旋转着，跳起了法国牟涅舞；我依次和姑娘们跳，最讨厌的偏偏最不肯放你走。后来，绿蒂和她的舞友跳起了英国乡村舞；在轮到她来和我们交叉的一刹那，你想想我心里是如何美滋滋的哟。看她跳舞真叫大饱眼福！你瞧，她跳得那么专心，那么忘我，整个身体和谐之极。她无忧无虑地跳着，无拘无束地跳着，仿佛跳舞就是一切，除此便无所思，无所感似的；此刻，其他任何事物都在她眼前消失了。

我请她跳第二轮英国乡村舞；她答应第三轮陪我跳，同时以世间最可爱的坦率态度对我说，她最爱跳德国华尔兹舞了。

“本地时兴跳华尔兹舞时原配伴当继续一起跳，”她说，“只是我的Chapeau[14]华尔兹跳得太糟，巴不得我免除他这个义务。您的小姐跳得也不好，又不喜欢跳；我从刚才跳英国舞看出，您的华尔兹准不错。要是您乐意陪我跳的话，那您就去请我的对手同意，我也找您的小姐说说。”

我一听便握住她的手。这样，我们便谈妥了，在跳华尔兹舞时，由她的男舞伴陪着我的女舞友闲谈。

喏，开始！我俩用各种方式挽着手臂，以此开心了好一会儿。瞧她跳得有多妩媚，多轻盈啊！华尔兹舞开始了，一双双舞伴转起圈来跟流星一般快，其实真正会的人很少，一开头场上便有点乱糟糟的。我们很机灵，先让那班笨蛋们蹦够了，退了场，才跳到中间去，和另外一对儿也就是奥德兰他们在一起，大显起身手来。我从没跳得如此轻快过，简直飘飘欲仙。手臂搂着个无比可爱的人儿，带着她轻风似的飞旋，周围的一切都没有了，消失了……威廉哟，凭良心说，我敢起誓，我宁可粉身碎骨，也绝不肯让这个我爱的姑娘，我渴望占有的姑娘，在和我跳过以后还去和任何人跳呵。你理解我么！

我们在大厅中漫步了几圈，为了喘口气。随后她坐下来，很高兴地吃着我特意摆在一边、如今已是所剩不多的几个橘子。这橘子可算帮了大忙。只是当她每递一片给她邻座的姑娘，这姑娘也老大不客气地接过去吃起来时，我的心都像被刀刺了一下似的疼痛。

在跳第三轮英国乡村舞时，我们是第二对。我俩跳着从队列中间穿过，上帝知道我是多么快活。我勾着她的胳膊，眼睛盯住她那洋溢着无比坦诚、无比纯洁的欢愉的盈盈秋波；不知不觉间，我们跳到了一位夫人面前。她年纪虽已不轻，然而风韵犹存，因而引起过我的注意。只见她笑吟吟地瞅着绿蒂，举起一个手指头来像要发出警告似的，并在我们擦过她身旁时意味深长地念了两次阿尔伯特这个名字。

“谁是阿尔伯特？”我对绿蒂说，“我想冒昧问一下。”

她正待回答，我们却不得不分开，以便作8字交叉。可是，在我和她擦身而过的瞬间，我恍惚看见她额头上泛起了疑云。

“我有什么不能告诉您呢？”她一边伸过手来让我牵着徐徐往前走，一边说，“阿尔伯特是个好人，我与他可以说已经订婚了。”

本来这对我并非新闻，姑娘们在路上已告诉过我了；可是经过刚才的一会儿工夫，她对我变得已如此珍贵，此刻再联系着她来想这事，我就感到非同小可了。总而言之，我心烦意乱，忘乎所以，竟窜进了别的对儿中，把整个队列搅得七零八落，害得绿蒂费尽心力，又拉又拽，才迅速恢复了秩序。

舞会还没完，天边已经电光闪闪，隆隆的雷声盖过了音乐声。闪电是我们早看见了的，可我一直解释说，只不过天要转凉罢了。这当儿三个姑娘逃出了队列，她们的舞伴尾随其后，秩序便顿时大乱，伴奏也只好停止了。不消说，人在纵情欢乐之际突遭不测与惊吓，那印象是比平时来得更加强烈的；因为，一方面，两相对照，使人感觉更加鲜明，另一方面和更主要的，我们的感官本已处于亢奋状态，接受起印象来也更快。这就难怪好些姑娘一下子都吓得脸变了色。她们中最聪明的一个坐到屋角里，背冲窗户，手捂耳朵。另一个跪在她跟前，脑袋埋在她怀中。第三个挤进她俩中间，搂着自己的女友，泪流满面。有几个要求回家；另一些则更加不知所措，连驾驭我们那些年轻趋奉者的心力都没有了，只知道战战兢兢地祈祷上帝，结果小伙子们便放肆起来，全忙着用嘴去美丽的受难者唇边代替上帝接受祷告。有几位先生偷闲到下边抽烟去了；其余的男女却都赞成聪明的女主人的提议，进到了一间有百叶窗和窗幔的屋子里。刚一进门，绿蒂便忙着把椅子排成一个圆圈。大伙儿应她的请求坐定了，她便开始讲解做一种游戏的要领。

我瞅见有几个小伙子已经尖起嘴唇，手舞足蹈，盼望着去领胜利者的厚赏了。

“喏，咱们玩数数游戏，”绿蒂说，“注意！我在圈子里从右向左走，同时你们就挨个儿报数，每人要念出轮到他的那个数目字，而且要念得飞快，谁如果结巴或念错了，就吃一记耳光，这么一直念到一千。”

这一来才叫好看喽！只见绿蒂伸出胳膊，在圈子里走动起来。头一个人开始数一，旁边一个数二，再下一个数三，依次类推。随后绿蒂越走越快，越走越快。这当儿有谁数错了，“啪”！——一记耳光；旁边的人忍俊不禁，“啪”！——又是一记耳光。速度更加快了。我本人也挨了两下子；使我打心眼儿里满意的是，我相信我挨的这两下子比她给其他人的还要重些。可不等数完一千，大伙儿已笑成一堆，再也玩不下去了。这时暴风雨业已过去，好朋友们便三三两两走到一边，我便跟着绿蒂回到大厅。半道儿上她对我说：

“他们吃了耳光，倒把打雷下雨什么的一股脑儿忘记啦！”

我无言以对。

“我也是胆儿最小的一个，”她接着说，“可我鼓起勇气来给别人壮胆，自己也就有胆量了。”

我们踱到一扇窗前。远方传来滚滚雷声，春雨刷刷地抽打在泥地上，空气中有一股扑鼻的芳香升腾起来，沁人心脾。她胳膊肘支在窗台上伫立着，目光凝视远方，一会儿仰望苍空，一会儿又瞅瞅我；我见她眼里噙着泪花，把手放在了我的手上。

“克罗卜斯托克呵！”她叹道。

我顿时想到了此刻萦绕在她脑际的那首壮丽颂歌[15]，感情也因之澎湃汹涌起来。她仅仅用一个词儿，便打开了我感情的闸门。我忍不住把头俯在她手上，喜泪纵横地吻着。随后我又仰望她的眼睛。——高贵的诗人呵！你要是能看到你在这目光中变得有多神圣，就太好了；从今以后，我再不愿从那班常常亵渎你的人口里，听见你的名字。





六月十九日


前一次讲到哪儿，我已不记得了；我只知道，我上床睡觉已是午夜两点。要是我能当面和你聊聊，而不是写信，我没准儿会让你一直坐到天亮的。

舞会归来途中发生的情况，我还没有讲，今天也仍然不是讲的时候。

那正是旭日东升、壮丽无比的时刻。周围的树林挂满露珠儿，田野一片青翠！我们的两位女伴打起盹儿来。绿蒂问我，我是否也想像她俩似的迷糊一下，并说，我不用操心她。

“多会儿我看见这双眼睛睁着，”我目不转睛地望着她道，“多会儿我就不会困倦。”

这样，我俩便坚持到了她家的大门口。女仆轻轻地为她开了门，回答她的询问说，父亲和孩子们都好，眼下还全在睡觉。临别，我求她允许我当天再去看她，她也同意；过后我果然去了。自此，日月星辰尽可以安安静静地升起又落下，我却再也分不清白天和黑夜，周围的整个世界全给抛到了脑后。





六月二十一日


我过着极其幸福的日子，上帝能留给他那些圣徒们过的日子，想来也不过如此吧。不管我将来会怎样，反正我不能再说，我没有享受过欢乐，没有享受过最纯净的生之乐趣。——你是了解我的，威廉；我在这儿已完全定居下来，此处离绿蒂家只有半小时路程，在这儿我才充分感觉到自身的存在以及作为一个人所能享有的全部幸福。

过去我也曾一次次地到瓦尔海姆散步，但何尝想到它竟然离天国这么近！我在作长距离漫游的途中，有时从山顶上，有时从河对岸的平野里，不是已无数次地眺望过如今珍藏着我的全部希望的猎庄么！

亲爱的威廉，对于人们心中那种想要自我扩张，想要发现新鲜事物，想要四处走走、见见世面的欲望，我曾经考虑得很多很多；后来，对于他们的逆来顺受，循规蹈矩，对周围任何事情都漠不关心的本能，我又作了种种思索。

真美啊，我能来到这儿的小丘上，眺望那道美丽的峡谷，那周围的景物竟是如此地吸引着我。——那儿有一座小小的树林！——你要能到林荫中去有多好！——那儿有一座高高的山峰！——你要能从峰顶俯瞰辽阔的原野有多好！——那儿有连绵的丘陵，幽静的沟壑，你要能徜徉其中，流连忘返有多好！

我匆匆赶去，去而复返，却不曾找到我所希望的东西。呵，对远方的希冀犹如对未来的憧憬！它像一个巨大的、朦胧的整体，静静地呈现在我们的灵魂面前，我们的感觉却和我们的视觉一样，在它里边也变得迷茫模糊了；但我们仍然渴望着，唉！渴望着献出自己的整个生命，渴望着让那唯一的伟大而奇妙的感情来充溢自己的心。——可是，当我们真的赶上去，当那儿成了这儿，当未来的一切仍一如既往，唉！我们就发现自己仍然平庸，仍然浅陋；我们的灵魂仍然焦渴难当，切盼着吸吮那已经流走了的甘霖。

这样，浪迹天涯的游子最终又会思恋故土，并在自己的茅屋内，在妻子的怀抱里，在儿女们的簇拥下，在为维持生计的忙碌操劳中，找到他在广大的世界上不曾寻得的欢乐。

清晨，我随日出而出，去到我的瓦尔海姆，在那儿的菜园中采摘豌豆荚，采够了就隐坐在地上撕去荚儿上的筋，边撕边读我的荷马。回到厨下，我又挑选一只锅子，切下一块黄油，把黄油和豆荚一块儿倒进锅中，把锅炖在炉子上，盖好盖儿，自己坐在一旁，时不时地把锅里的豆荚搅两下——这当儿，珀涅罗珀[16]那些高傲的求婚者们屠牛宰猪、剔骨烹肉的情景，便栩栩如生地让我体验到了。感谢上帝，古代宗法社会的特殊生活习俗竟如此自然地与我的生活交融在一起，这比什么都更使我心中充满了宁帖与踏实的感觉。

我真快活哟，我的心竟还能感受到一个人将自己种的蔬菜端上饭桌来时那种纯真的欢乐；此刻摆在你面前的，可不仅仅是这么棵卷心菜啊，那栽插秧苗的美丽清晨，那洒水浇灌的可爱黄昏，所有那些为它的不断生长而满怀欣喜的好时光，统统都在一瞬间让你再次享受到了。





六月二十九日


前天，本地的大夫从城里来到总管家，正碰上我和绿蒂的弟妹们一起蹲在地上玩儿。他们有的在我身上爬来爬去，有的对我进行挑逗，我便搔起他们的痒痒来，乐得小家伙们大笑大嚷。大夫是个木头人似的老古板，一边说话一边不住地整理袖口上的绉边，把里面的一个丝卷儿拔来拔去。我从他先生的鼻子上看出来，他显然认为像我这样是有失一个聪明人的尊严的。我装作没有看见，任随他去大发他那十分明智的议论，自己却继续帮孩子们搭被他们打垮了的纸牌房子。事后，他回到城里去四处诉说：“总管的孩子们本来就够没教养的，这一来更让维特给全毁喽。”

是的，威廉，在这个世界上离我的心最近的是孩子们。每当我从旁观察他们，从细小的事情中发现他们有朝一日所需要的种种品德与才能的萌芽，从他们今日的固执任性中看出将来的坚毅与刚强，从今日的顽皮放肆中看出将来的幽默乐观以及轻松愉快地应付人世危难的本领，每当我发现这一切还丝毫未经败坏，完整无损，我便一次一次地，反反复复地，吟味人类的导师[17]这句金言。“可叹呀，你们要是不能变成小孩子的样子！”然而他们，好朋友，这些我们的同类，这些本应被我们视为楷模的人，我们对待他们却像奴隶，竟不允许他们有自己的意志！——我们难道没有自己的意志吗？我们凭什么该享受这个特权呢？——因为我年长一些，懂事一些！——你天国中的仁慈上帝呵，你可是把人类仅仅分成年长的孩子和年幼的孩子的；至于你更喜欢哪一类孩子，你的圣子可已早有宣示呀。然而人们尽管信奉他，却并不听他话——这也是个老问题！——因而都在照着自己的模样教育自己的孩子……

再见，威廉！我不想再就这个问题空谈下去。





七月一日


一个病人多么需要绿蒂，我自己这颗可怜的心已经深有所感；它比起一个呻吟病榻者来，情况还更糟糕些。绿蒂要进城几天，去陪一位生病的夫人，据医生讲，这位贤惠的夫人离死已经不远，临终时刻，她渴望绿蒂能待在自己身边。

上个礼拜，我曾陪绿蒂去圣××看一位牧师；那是个小地方，要往山里走一个小时，我们到达的时候已快下午四点了。绿蒂带着她的第二个妹妹。我们踏进院中长着两株高大的胡桃树的牧师住宅，这当儿善良的老人正坐在房门口的一条长凳上，一见绿蒂便抖擞精神，吃力地站起身，准备迎上前来，连他那树节疤手杖也忘记使了。绿蒂赶忙跑过去，按他坐到凳子上，自己也挨着老人坐下，一次又一次地转达父亲对他的问候，还把他那老来得的宝贝幺儿——一个肮脏淘气的小男孩抱在怀中。她如此地迁就老人，把自己的嗓门提得高高的，好让他那半聋的耳朵能听明白她的话；她告诉他，有些年纪轻轻，身强力壮的人不知怎么一下子就死了；她称赞老人明年去卡尔斯巴德的决定，说洗温泉浴对身体大有好处；她声称，他比她上次见着时气色好得多，精神健旺得多——如此等等。威廉，你要能亲眼目睹才好喽。这其间，我也有礼貌地问候了牧师太太。老爷子真是兴致勃勃，我只忍不住夸赞了他那两株枝叶扶疏、浓荫宜人的胡桃树几句，他便打开了话匣子，尽管口齿不灵，却滔滔不绝地讲述起这树的历史来。

“那株老树是谁种的，”他说，“我们已不知道了；一些人讲这个牧师，另一些人讲那个牧师。可靠后边这株年轻点的树，它和我老伴一般大，今年十月就满五十喽。她父亲早上栽好树苗儿，傍晚她就下了地。他是我的前任，这株树对他真有说不出的珍贵，而对我也一点儿不差。二十七年前，当时我还是个穷大学生，第一次踏进这座院子就看见我妻子坐在树荫下的栅木上，手中干着编织活计……”

绿蒂问起他的女儿，他回答，和施密特先生一起到草地上看工人们干活儿去了。说完，他又继续讲起自己的故事来：他的前任及其闺女如何相中了他，他如何先当老牧师的副手，后来又继承了他的职位。故事不久就讲完了，这当儿牧师的女儿正和那位施密特先生穿过花园走来。姑娘亲亲热热地对绿蒂表示欢迎；我必须说，她给我的印象不坏，是个体格健美、生气勃勃的褐发女郎，和她一起住在乡下大概会很快乐的。她的爱人呢（须知施密特先生是立刻就这样自我介绍的），是个文雅然而却沉默寡言的人，尽管绿蒂一再跟他搭腔，他却不肯参加我们的谈话。最令我扫兴的是，我从他表情中隐隐看出，他之不肯轻易开口，与其说是由于智力不足，倒不如说是由于性情执拗和乖僻。可惜后来这点是再清楚不过的了；当散步中弗莉德里克和绿蒂偶尔也和我走在一起的时候，这位老兄那本来就黝黑的面孔更明显地阴沉下来，使绿蒂不得不扯扯我的衣袖，暗示我别对弗莉德里克太殷勤。我平生最讨厌的莫过于人与人之间相互折磨了，尤其是生命力旺盛的青年，他们本该坦坦荡荡，乐乐呵呵，实际上却常常板起面孔，把仅有的几天好时光也彼此给糟蹋掉，等到日后省悟过来，却已追悔莫及。我心头不痛快；因此傍晚，我们走进牧师住的院子，坐在一张桌旁喝牛奶，当话题转到人世间的欢乐与痛苦上来的当儿，我便忍不住抢过话头，激烈地批评起某些人的乖僻来。

“我们人呵，”我开口道，“常常抱怨好日子如此少，坏日子如此多；依我想来，这种抱怨多半都没有道理。只要我们总是心胸开阔，享受上帝每天赏赐给我们的欢乐，那么，我们也会有足够的力量承担一旦到来的痛苦。”

“不过我们也无力完全控制自己的感情呀，”牧师太太说，“肉体的影响太大了，一个人要是身体不舒服，他到哪儿也感到不对劲儿的！”

我承认她讲得对，但继续说：

“那我们就把性情乖僻也看成一种疾病，并且问是不是有办法治它呢？”

“这话不假，”绿蒂说，“我至少相信，我们自己的态度是很重要的。我有切身的体会：每当什么事使我厌烦，使我生气，我便跑出去，在花园里来回走走，哼几遍乡村舞曲，这一来烦恼就全没了。”

“这正是我想讲的，”我接过话头道，“乖僻就跟惰性一样，要知道它本来就是一种惰性呵。我们生来都是有此惰性的，可是，只要我们能有一次鼓起勇气克服了它，接下去便会顺顺当当，并在活动中获得真正的愉快。”

弗莉德里克听得入了神；年轻人却反驳我说，人无法掌握自己，更甭提控制自己的感情。

“此地说的是令人不快的感情，”我回敬他，“这种感情可是人人乐于摆脱的哩；何况在不曾尝试之前，谁也不知道自己的力量有多大。可不是吗，谁生了病都会四处求医，再多的禁忌，再苦的汤药，他都不会拒绝，为的是得到所希望的健康。”——我发现诚实的老人也竖起耳朵，努力在听我们谈话，便提高嗓门，转过脸去冲着他接着往下讲。——“教士们在布道时谴责过那么多种罪过，”我说，“我却从来不曾听到有谁从布道坛上谴责过坏脾气[18]。”

“这事得由城里的牧师去做，”老人说，“乡下人没有坏脾气。当然，偶尔在这儿讲讲也无妨，至少对村长先生和他夫人是有好处的。”

在场的人全笑了，他自己也笑得咳起嗽来，使谈话中断了好一阵。后来，是年轻人又开了口。

“您称乖僻是罪过，我想未免太过分吧。”

“一点不过分，”我回答，“既然害己又损人，就该称作罪过。难道我们不能使彼此幸福还不够，还必须相互夺去各人心中偶尔产生的一点点快乐么？请您告诉我有哪一个人，他性子很坏，同时却有本领藏而不露，仅仅自苦，而不破坏周围人们的快乐呢！或者您能够说，这坏脾气不正表现了我们对自己的卑微的懊丧，表现了我们自己对自己的不满，而且其中还掺杂着某种由愚蠢的虚荣刺激起来的嫉妒么？要知道看见一些幸福的人而这些人的幸福又不仰赖于我们，是够难受的呵。”

见我们争得这么激动，绿蒂冲我微微一笑；可弗莉德里克眼里却噙着泪水，使我讲得更来劲儿了：

“有种人利用自己对另一颗心的控制力，去破坏人家心里自行产生的单纯的快乐，这种人真可恨。要知道世间的所有礼物，所有的甜言蜜语，也补偿不了我们顷刻间失去的快乐，补偿不了被我们的暴君的嫉妒所破坏了的快乐哟。”

说到此，我的心一下子整个充满了感慨，往事一桩桩掠过脑际，热泪涌进眼眶，不禁高呼起来：

“我们应该每天对自己讲：你只能对朋友做一件事，即让他们获得快乐，使他们更加幸福，并同他们一起分享这幸福。当他们的灵魂受着忧愁的折磨，为苦闷所扰乱的时候，你能给他们以点滴的慰藉么？

“临了，一当最可怕的疾病向那个被你葬送了的青春年华的姑娘袭来，她奄奄一息地躺在床上，目光茫然地仰望天空，冷汗一颗颗地渗出额头，这时候，你就会像个受诅咒的罪人似的站在她床前，无能为力，一筹莫展，心中感到深深的恐惧与内疚，恨不得献出自己的一切，以便给这个垂死的生命一点点力量，一星星勇气。”

说着说着，我亲身经历过的这样一个情景便猛然闯进我的记忆。我掏出手帕来捂住眼睛，离开了众人，直到绿蒂来唤我说：“咱们走吧！”我才恍如大梦初醒。归途中，她责怪我对什么事都太爱动感情，说照此下去我会毁了的，要我自己珍惜自己！——天使呵，为了你的缘故，我必须活下去！





七月六日


她仍然待在自己病危的女友身边，始终如一地服侍着她，又细心又温柔，单单让她看上一眼，病人就会减少痛苦，变得幸福。昨天傍晚，她领着玛莉安娜和玛尔馨出外散步，我听说后赶去追上了她。在一块儿溜达了一个半小时，我们才转身往城里走，到了那眼对我十分珍贵的井泉边。如今，它对我又增加了一千倍的价值。绿蒂在井垣上坐了下来，我们站在她跟前。我环顾四周，啊，我的心十分孤寂的那段时间的景象，重又活现在我眼前。“亲爱的井泉呀。”我说，“我好久没来你这儿乘凉啦，有时匆匆走过你身旁，竟连看都不曾看你一眼！”我往台阶下望去，却见玛尔馨小心翼翼地端着一杯泉水爬上来。——我凝视着绿蒂，心中感觉到了她对于我的全部价值。这当儿玛尔馨端着水走近了，玛莉安娜伸出手去想接。

“不，不！”小姑娘模样儿甜甜地嚷道，“绿蒂姐姐，你得先喝！”

她说得如此天真、可爱，令我大为感动，以致一时不知如何表达自己的感情，竟从地上抱起小姑娘来死劲儿亲了几下，她马上就又哭又闹起来。

“瞧您闯祸啰。”绿蒂说。

我不知所措。

“过来，玛尔馨，”她拉住小妹妹的手，领她走下台阶，继续说，“快，快！快用清亮的泉水洗一洗。这样就不要紧啦。”

我却站在一旁，看着小姑娘急急忙忙地捧起水来擦洗自己的脸蛋儿，一副深信不疑的神气，以为真的只有用这神奇的泉水一洗，脸上才不会长出丢人而丑陋的胡须[19]。尽管绿蒂说洗够了，小姑娘仍一个劲儿洗呀洗呀，仿佛多洗总比少洗好一些。——告诉你，威廉，我还从来不曾怀着更深的虔敬参加过一次洗礼哩。绿蒂上来以后，我真恨不得扑到她的脚边，就像跪在某个用神力禳解了一个民族的孽债的先知跟前一样。

晚上，我心里太高兴了，便忍不住把这件事讲给一位我认为还算通达人情的男子听，因为他人挺聪明的；谁料却碰了一鼻子灰！他道，绿蒂的做法很欠妥，对小孩子可不能弄什么玄虚；这样一搞会滋长种种错觉和迷信，而孩子却必须从小就不让他们受坏影响才是。——听了他的话我才想起，此人是一个礼拜前才受的洗礼，因此不以为怪，只是在心中仍坚信这个真理：我们对待孩子们，也该像上帝对待我们一样，当上帝让我们沉醉在愉快的幻觉中的时候，他就是给了我们最大的幸福。





七月八日


我真是个孩子呵！我竟如此地看重她那青眼的一瞥！我真正是个孩子！

我们去瓦尔海姆郊游。姑娘们是乘车去的。后来在一块儿散步时，我总觉得在绿蒂乌黑的眸子中带着些……我是个傻瓜，原谅我吧！你真应该瞧瞧它们，瞧瞧她这双眼睛！——我想写简单点，我困得眼皮都快合拢了。喏，姑娘们上了车，而我们——青年W.塞尔斯塔特以及奥德兰和我，却围着马车站在那里。这当口，她们便从车帘中探出头来，跟送别的人闲聊，小伙子们自然一个个都是够快活的。我极力捕捉绿蒂的目光；唉，它们却望望这个，又瞅瞅那个！看着我呀！看着我呀！看着我呀！我把整个身心全贯注于你们，你们干吗还逃避我哟！——我的心对她道了千百次再见，可她却连瞅也不瞅我！马车开过去了，我眼中噙着泪水。我目送着她，在车门旁看见了她的帽子，呵，她转过头来了！是在看我么？

好朋友啊，我的心至今仍七上八下，怀着这个疑问。唯一的安慰是，她回过头来也许是看我吧！也许！……

晚安！呵，我真是个孩子！





七月十日


每当在聚会中听见人家谈起她，我便会变得傻痴痴的，那模样你要能看见就好了！特别是有谁问我“喜不喜欢她”的时候！——“喜欢”！这个词儿简直让我给恨得要死。一个人要不是全部知觉、全部感情都充满对她的倾慕，而仅仅是喜欢她，这还成个什么人呢？哼，“喜欢”！最近又有谁问我“喜不喜欢莪相”[20]！





七月十一日


M夫人已危在旦夕。我为她的生命祈祷；因为绿蒂心里难过，我也同样难过。我很少到M夫人处去看绿蒂；今天她却给我讲了一桩很奇特的事情：

M这个老头子是个刮皮到了家的吝啬鬼，一辈子把自己的老婆折磨和克扣得够呛，可她却偏偏有办法对付过来。几天前，医生断定她已活不久了，她便让人找来她的丈夫（绿蒂也在房里），对他讲：“我必须向你交代一件事；不然，我死以后，家里会出乱子和麻烦的。我操持家务直到今天，凡事都尽量做到井井有条，能节省就节省。可是，你要原谅我，我这三十年一直欺骗你。我们刚结婚时，你规定了一个小小的数目，作为伙食和其他家用。但到后来，家大业大，花销多了，你却死也不肯相应增加每周的开支。简单讲，你自己也明白，在那些花费最大的时期，你却要求我每周只支用七个古尔盾。我接过这点钱来也总没吭声，不足部分就只好去柜上拿，因为谁想得到，身为太太竟会做小偷呢。我丝毫不曾浪费，就算不向你承认这些，也尽可以心安理得地闭上眼睛；可是在我之后来管这份家的那个女人，她却没办法对付呵。而你到时候却会一口咬定，你的前妻都是这么撑过来的。”

我和绿蒂谈到人心的虚妄真是到了难以置信的程度；明明看见花销大了一倍，却偏偏只给七个古尔盾而心安理得，全不想到这后面必定另有隐情。此外，我自己还认识一些人，他们会把先知的宝油瓶毫不惊奇地接回家去供起来。[21]

不，我不是自己欺骗自己！我在她那乌黑的眼睛里，的的确确看到了对我和我的命运的同情。是的，这是我心中的感觉；然而，在这一点上，我可以相信我的心不会错……我感觉：她……呵，我可以，我能够用这句话来表达自己的无上幸福么？——这句话就是：她爱我！

她爱我！——而我对于自己也变得多么可贵了呵，我是多么——这话我可以告诉你，因为你能够理解它——多么崇拜自己了呵，自从她爱我！

也不知是自己想入非非，还是对情况的正确感觉？那个使我为自己在绿蒂心中的地位担心的人，我不了解。可是，尽管如此，每当她谈起自己的未婚夫来，谈得那么温柔，那么亲切，我心中就颓唐得如一个丧失了所有荣誉与尊严的人，连手中自卫的宝剑也被夺去了。





七月十六日


每当我的指尖儿无意间触着她的手指，每当我俩的脚在桌子底下相互碰着，呵，我的血液立刻加快了流动！我避之唯恐不及，就像碰着了火似的。可是，一种神秘的力量又在吸引我过去……我真是心醉神迷了！

可她却那么天真无邪，心怀坦荡，全感觉不到这些亲密的小动作带给了我多少的痛苦！尤其当她在谈心时把自己的手抚在我的手上，谈高兴了更把头靠近我，使我的嘴唇感觉到了从她口里送来的天香，此刻，我真像是让闪电给击中了，身子直往下沉，脚下也轻飘飘地完全失去了依托……威廉啊，要是我啥时候能冒险登一登天堂，大胆地去……你理解我指什么。不，我的心还没有这么坏！它只是软弱，很软弱罢了！而软弱还并非坏吧？

她是圣洁的。一切欲念在她面前都会沉默无言。每当我和她在一起的时候，我都不知道自己的心境如何，仿佛所有的神经和官能都错乱颠倒了。——她喜欢一支曲子，常常在钢琴上弹奏它，弹得如天使一般动人，单纯，富于情感！这是她心爱的曲子，每次只要她弹出第一个音符，我的一切痛苦、烦恼和古怪念头便烟消云散。

这支单纯的曲子令我大为感动，任何关于音乐的古老魅力的说法，在我听来都不再不可信了。而且，每每在我恨不得用子弹射穿自己脑袋的时候，她都弹起这支曲子来，我心中的迷茫黑暗顿时消散，呼吸重新又自如了。





七月十八日


威廉，你想想这世界要是没有爱情，它在我们心中还会有什么意义！这就如一盏没有亮光的走马灯[22]！可是一当放进亮光去，白壁上便会映出五彩缤纷的图像，尽管仅只是些稍纵即逝的影子；但只要我们能像孩子似的为这种奇妙的现象所迷醉，它也足以造就咱们的幸福呵。今天我不能去看绿蒂，有一个免不掉的聚会拖住了我。怎么办？我派了我的佣人去，仅仅为了自己身边有一个今天接近过她的人。我急不可耐地等着佣人回来，一见到他就有说不出的高兴！要是不害臊，真恨不得捧住他的脑袋亲一亲！人们常讲电光石的故事，说它放在太阳地里便会吸收阳光，到了夜间仍旧亮华华的。这小伙子对于我也就如电光石。我感到，她的目光曾在他脸上、面颊上、上衣纽扣以及外套的绉领上停留过，这一切因此对我也变得十分神圣、十分珍贵了！此刻，就是给一千银塔勒，我都不肯把这小伙子让给谁的。有他在跟前，我心里舒畅。——上帝保佑，你可别笑我啊。威廉，难道令我心中舒畅的东西，还会是幻影么？





七月十九日


“我将要见到她啦！”清晨我醒来，望着东升的旭日，兴高采烈地喊道，“我将要见到她啦！”除此我别无希求；一切的一切，全融汇在这个期待中了。





七月二十日


你劝我跟公使到×地去的想法，我还不打算同意。我不大喜欢听人差遣，加之此公又是位众所周知的讨厌的人。你信上说，我母亲希望看见我有所作为。这使我感到好笑。难道我眼下不也是在做事么？归根到底，不管我是摘豌豆还是摘扁豆，不也一样么？世界上的一切事情，说穿了全都无聊。一个人要是没有热情，没有需要，仅仅为了他人的缘故去逐利追名，苦苦折腾，这个人便是傻瓜。





七月二十四日


你是那么担心，生怕我把画画给荒疏了，我本想压根儿不提此事，免得告诉你说，近来我很少画画。

我从来还不曾如此幸福过；我对自然的感受，哪怕小到一块石头，一根青草，也从来还不曾这么充实，这么亲切过。可是——我不知如何表达自己意思才好——我的想象力这么微弱，一切在我心里都游移不定，摇摇晃晃，我简直抓不住任何轮廓。不过我仍自信，我要是手头有黏土或者蜡泥，我也会塑造出点什么来的。要是黏土保存得更久，我就取黏土来捏，即便捏出些饼子也好。

绿蒂的肖像我已画过三次，三次都出了丑。这事令我极为懊恼，尤其因为我前些时候一直很成功。后来我就画了一张她的剪影像聊以自慰。





七月二十五日


好的，亲爱的绿蒂，我将一切照办，一切办妥；你只管多多给我任务吧，常常给我任务吧！可有一点，我求求你，以后千万别再往你写给我的字条上撒沙子[23]。今天我一接着它就送到嘴上去吻，结果弄得牙齿里全嘎吱嘎吱的。





七月二十六日


我已经下过几次决心，不要经常去看她。是啊，可谁又能做得到呢！日复一日，我都屈服于诱惑，同时又对自己许下神圣的诺言：明天说什么也不去啦。

可明天一到，我总又找得出一条无法辩驳的理由，眼一眨又到了她身边。这理由要么是她昨晚讲过：“你明天还来，对吗？”——而谁又能不来呢！——要么是她托我办件事，我觉得理应亲自去给她个回话；要么是天气实在太好，我到瓦尔海姆去了，而一到瓦尔海姆，离她不就只有半个小时的路程了吗！——周围的气氛，使我感觉她近在咫尺，于是一抬腿，便到了她跟前！记得我祖母曾讲过一个磁石山的故事，说的是海上有一座磁石山，船行太近了，所有铁器如钉子什么的便会一下子被吸出来，飞到山上去；倒霉的船夫也就从分崩离析的船板中掉下去，惨遭没顶。





七月三十日


阿尔伯特已经回来了，而我就要走了。尽管他是一位十分善良、十分高尚的人，尽管我在任何方面都准备对他甘拜下风，可眼睁睁看着他占有那么多完美的珍宝，我仍然受不了！——占有！——一句话，威廉，未婚夫回来啦！倒是个令你不能不产生好感的能干而和蔼的男子。幸好接他那会儿我在，不然我的心会被撕碎了的！阿尔伯特也真够正派，当着我的面从来没有吻过绿蒂。上帝奖励他吧！为了他对姑娘的尊重，我不能不爱他。他对我也很友善，我猜想这更多出于绿蒂的调弄，他的本心则少一些。要晓得女士们都精于此道，而且也自有她们的道理；只要她们有本事使两个崇拜者和睦相处，那么好处总归是她们的，尽管要做到绝非容易。

话虽如此，我仍不能不对阿尔伯特怀着敬重。他那冷静的外表，与我不安的个性形成鲜明的对照；而这不安我怎么也掩饰不了。他感觉敏锐，深知绿蒂多么可爱。看起来他没有什么坏脾气；而你知道，我是最恨人身上的脾气不好这种罪恶的。

他认为我是个有头脑的人；我对绿蒂的倾慕，对她一言一行的赞美，都只增加了他的得意，使他反倒更加爱她。他是否偶尔也对她发发醋劲儿，我暂且不问；至少我要是他，就难保完全不受嫉妒这个魔鬼的诱惑。

不管怎么讲吧，我在绿蒂身边的快乐反正是吹啦！我不知该叫这是愚蠢呢，还是头脑发昏？——名称又有何用，事实就是事实！——现在我知道的一切，在阿尔伯特回来之前我就知道了。我知道，我没权要求绿蒂什么，也不曾要求什么。这就是说，尽管她那么迷人，我也竭力使自己不产生欲望。可而今另一个人真的到来，夺走了姑娘，我却傻了眼。

我咬紧牙关，两倍三倍地更加鄙视某些个可能说我应该自行退出的人；他们会讲，别无他法了嘛。——让这些废物见鬼去吧！——我成天在林子里乱跑一气。每当去到绿蒂那儿，发现阿尔伯特和她一起坐在园子里的凉亭中，我就脚下生了根，模样变得傻不愣愣，说起话来语无伦次。

“看在上帝分上，”绿蒂今天对我说，“我求你行行好，别再像昨儿傍晚似的做戏行不行！您那副可笑的样子真要命。”

坦白说，我一瞅见阿尔伯特不在，忽的一下就跑了去。一当发现只有她一个人，我的心啊，总是乐滋滋的。





八月八日


我请你原谅，亲爱的威廉！我把那些要求我们服从不可抗拒的命运的人骂作废物，的的确确并非指你。我实在没有想到，你也会有类似想法。当然，从根本上讲，你是对的。不过，好朋友，世上的事情很少能要么干脆这样，要么干脆那样。人的感情和行为千差万别，正如在鹰钩鼻子与塌鼻子之间，还可能有各式各样别的鼻子。

你别见怪：我承认你的整个论点，却又企图从“要么这样——要么那样”这个空子中间钻过去。

你说什么，“要么你有希望得到绿蒂，要么根本没有。好啦，如果是第一种情况，你就努力实现它，努力满足自己的愿望；否则，你就振作起来，摆脱那该死的感情，要不然它一定会把你的全部精力都吞掉。”——好朋友，说得动听！说得容易！

可是，对于一个受着慢性病摧残而一步一步地走向死亡的人，难道你能要求他拿起刀来，一下子结束自己的痛苦么？病魔在耗尽他精力的同时，不也摧毁了他自我解脱的勇气么？

当然，你满可以用下面这个贴切的比喻来反驳我：谁不宁愿牺牲自己的一条胳膊，而是迟疑犹豫，甘冒丢掉生命的危险呢？

叫我怎么说好呢？——还是让我们别用这些比喻来伤彼此的脑筋吧。够了。

是的，威廉，我间或也在一瞬间有过振作起来、摆脱一切的勇气，然而……要是我知道往哪儿去的话，我早就走了！





傍晚


我的日记本好些时候以来给丢在一边，今天又让我无意间翻了开来。我很诧异，我竟是这样睁着眼睛一步一步地陷进了眼前的尴尬境地！我对自己的处境一直看得清清楚楚，可行动却像个小孩子似的；现在也仍然看得十分清楚，但就是没有丝毫悔改之意。





八月十日


我若不是个傻瓜，本可以过最幸福、最美满的生活。像我目前所处的这样一个令人心旷神怡的环境，是很不容易凑齐的。是啊，常言道得好：人之幸福，全在于心之幸福。我是这个和睦家庭中的一员，老人爱我如儿子，孩子们爱我如父亲，而且还有绿蒂！就说诚恳的阿尔伯特吧，他也不以任何乖僻来破坏我的幸福，而是以其亲切友善来拥抱我；对于他说来，除去绿蒂我就是世界上最亲爱的人了。——威廉，你听听我俩散步时是怎样谈绿蒂的吧，这会叫你愉快的。在世间，恐怕找不出比我们这种关系更可笑的了；然而我却常常被它感动得热泪盈眶。

阿尔伯特曾对我讲绿蒂可敬的母亲，讲她临终前如何把自己的家和孩子们托付给了绿蒂，如何又叮嘱他对绿蒂加以关照；讲到自那以后，绿蒂如何完全变成了另一个人，兢兢业业执掌家务，对孩子们爱护备至，无时无刻不在为他们操劳，俨然是一位母亲；但尽管如此，又从来不改活泼愉快的天性。我和阿尔伯特并肩走着，不时地弯下腰去采摘路旁的鲜花，用它们精心扎成一个花环，然后——我把花环抛进了从面前流过的溪水里，目送着它缓缓向下游漂去……

我记不清有没有告诉你，阿尔伯特将留下来，在此间的侯爵府中获得一个待遇优厚的差事；侯爵府上的人很器重他。像他这样办事精细勤谨的人，我见得不多。





八月十二日


的确，阿尔伯特是天底下最好的人。昨天，在我和他之间发生过一桩不寻常的事。我去向他告别，因为我突然心血来潮，想骑马到山里去；而眼下我便是从山里给你写信的。我在他房中来回踱着，目光偶然落在了他的手枪上。

“把手枪借给我旅途中用用吧。”我说。

“好的，”他回答，“要是你不怕麻烦，肯自己装装弹药的话。它们挂在那儿只是pro…forma[24]罢了。”

我从墙上摘下一支枪，他这时继续说道：

“我自从粗心大意，出过一回岔子，就不愿再和这玩意儿打交道了。”

我颇好奇，急于想知道是怎么回事，他就又讲：

“大约三个月以前，我住在乡下一位朋友家里，房中有几支小手枪，尽管没装弹药，晚上我也睡得安安稳稳的。在一个下雨的午后，我坐着没事干，不知怎么竟想到我们可能遭到坏人袭击，可能需要用手枪，可能……这样的事你是知道的。我于是把枪交给一名下人，叫他去擦拭和装药。这小子却拿去和使女们闹着玩儿，吓唬她们，却不知扳机怎么一弄就滑了，而通条又还在枪膛里，结果一下子飞出来，射中了一名使女的右手，把她的大拇指戳得稀烂。这一来我不仅挨抱怨，而且还得付医药费，从此我所有的枪都不再装药了。好朋友，小心谨慎又有什么用？危险并非全都可以预料啊！虽然……”

你知道，我喜欢这个人，除去他的“虽然”。不错，任何常理都容许有例外。可是他却太四平八稳！一当觉得自己言辞过激、有失中庸或不够精确，他就会一个劲儿地对你进行修正、限定、补充和删除，弄得到头来什么意思也不剩。眼下阿尔伯特正是越讲话越长，临了我根本没有再听他讲些什么，而是产生了一些怪念头，动作夸张地举起手枪来，用枪口对准自己右眼上方的太阳穴。

“呸！”阿尔伯特叫起来，夺去了我手中的枪，“你这是干吗呀？”

“没装药哩。”我回答。

“就算没装药也不该胡闹！”他不耐烦地说，“我真不能想象，一个人怎么会愚蠢到去自杀；单单这样想都令我反感。”

“你们这些人呵！”我提高嗓门道，“你们一谈什么都非得立刻讲：这是愚蠢的！这是明智的！这是好的！这是坏的！——这一切又意味着什么呢？为此你们弄清了一个行为的内情吗？探究过它何以发生，以及为什么必然发生的种种原因吗？你们要这样做过，就不会匆匆忙忙地下断语了。”

“可你得承认，”阿尔伯特说，“某些行为无论如何都是罪过，不管它出于什么动机。”

我耸了耸肩，承认他有道理。

“可是，亲爱的，”我又说，“这儿也有一些例外。不错，偷盗是一种罪行；然而，一个人为使自己和自己的亲人不致眼睁睁饿死而偷盗，这个人是值得同情呢，还是该受惩罚呢？一位丈夫出于义愤，杀死了不贞的妻子和卑鄙的奸夫，谁还会第一个捡起石头来砸他[25]吗？还有那个在幽会的欢乐中一时控制不住自己而失身的姑娘，谁又会谴责她呢？我们的法学家们都是些冷血的老古板；可就连他们也会被感动，因而不给予惩罚的。”

“这完全是另一码事，”阿尔伯特反驳说，“因为一个受热情驱使而失去思考力的人，人家只当他是醉汉，是疯子罢了。”

“嗨，你们这些明智的人啊！”我微笑着叫道，“热情！迷醉！疯狂！你们如此冷眼旁观，无动于衷，你们真是些好样的道学先生！你们嘲骂酒徒，厌恶疯子，像那个祭师[26]一般从他们身边走过，像那个法利赛人[27]似的感谢上帝，感谢他不曾把你们造成一名酒徒，一个疯子。可我呢，却不止一次迷醉过，我的热情从来都是离疯狂不远的；但这两点都不使我后悔，因为我凭自己的经验认识到：一切杰出的人，一切能完成伟大的、看似不可能的事业的人，他们从来总是给世人骂成酒鬼和疯子的。

“甚至在日常生活中也一样，只要谁的言行自由一些，清高一些，超乎一般人的想象，你就会听见人家在他背后叫：‘这家伙喝多了！这家伙是个傻瓜！’——真叫人受不了。真可耻，你们这些清醒的人！真可耻，你们这些智者！”

“瞧你又胡思乱想了，”阿尔伯特说，“你这人总是爱偏激，这回竟把我们谈的自杀扯到伟大事业上去，至少肯定是错了；因为自杀怎么也只能被看作软弱。与坚定地忍受充满痛苦的人生相比，死显然轻松得多。”

我已经打算中止谈话；要知道我讲的都是肺腑之言，他却用陈词滥调来进行反驳，真令我再生气不过。可是，这种话我听得多，气生得更多。所以仍能控制自己，兴致勃勃地反问他道：

“你称自杀为软弱？可我请你别让表面现象迷惑了啊。一个在暴君残酷压迫下呻吟的民族，他们终于奋起挣断枷锁，能说是软弱么？一个人面临自己的家被大火吞没的危险，鼓起劲来扛走他在冷静时根本搬不动的重物；一个人在受辱后的狂怒中，竟和六个人交起手来并且战胜了对方，这样的人能称为软弱么？还有，好朋友，既然奋发可以成为刚强，干吗亢奋就是它的反面呢？”

阿尔伯特凝视着我，说：

“你别见怪，你举的这些个例子，在我看来根本文不对题。”

“可能是吧，”我说，“人家也曾常常责备我，说我的联想和推理方式近乎古怪。好，那就让我们看能不能以另一种方式，想象一个决定抛弃人生的担子的人——这个担子在通常情况下应该是愉快的——他的心情会怎样。要知道只有我们有了同样的感受，我们才具备资格谈一件事情。

“人生来都有其局限，”我继续说，“他们能经受乐、苦、痛到一定的限度；一过这个限度，他们就完啦。这儿的问题不是刚强或者软弱；而是他们能否忍受痛苦超过一定的限度。尽管可能有精神上的痛苦和肉体上的痛苦之别，但是，正如我们不应该称一个患寒热病死去的人为胆小鬼一样，也很难称自杀者是懦夫。”

“荒唐，十分荒唐！”阿尔伯特嚷起来。

“才不像你想的那么荒唐呢，”我回答说，“你也该承认，当一种疾病严重损害我们的健康，使我们的精力一部分消耗掉了，一部分失去了作用，没有任何奇迹能再使我们恢复健康，重新进入日常生活的轨道，这样的疾病便被我们称为‘死症’。

“喏，亲爱的，让我们把这种推理用到精神方面，来瞧一瞧人的局限吧。一个人受到各种外界影响，便会产生固定的想法，到最后有增无减的狂热夺去了他冷静的思考力，以至于毁了他。

“一位清醒的明智的人可能对这个不幸者的处境一目了然，可能去劝他，但是白费力气。这正如一个站在病榻前的健康人，他丝毫不能把自己的生命力输送进病人的体内一样。”

阿尔伯特觉得这种说法仍太空泛。我便让他想想前不久从水塘中捞起来那个淹死了的少女，又对他讲了一遍她的故事。

“一个可爱的姑娘，生长在家庭的狭小圈子里，一礼拜接一礼拜地做着同样的家务，唯一的乐趣就是礼拜天用渐渐凑齐的一套好衣服穿戴打扮起来，和女伴一块儿出城去溜达溜达，逢年过节也许还跳跳舞，要不就再和某个邻居聊聊闲天，诸如谁跟谁为什么吵架啦，谁为什么又讲谁的坏话啦，如此等等，常常谈得专注而热烈，一谈就是几个钟头。可是后来，她火热的天性终于感到了一些更深刻的需要，而一经男子们来献殷勤，这些需要便更加热烈。从前的乐事已渐渐使她兴味索然；临了，她到底碰着一个人，某种从未经历过的感情不可抗拒地把她吸引到了此人身边，使她将自己的全部希望都寄托在他身上，以致忘记自己周围的一切，除了他，除了这唯一一个人，她什么也听不见，什么也看不见，什么也感觉不到，她所思所想的就只有他，只有这唯一一个人。她不为朝三暮四地卖弄风情的虚假欢乐所迷惑，一心一意追求着自己的目标，执意要成为他的，在与他永结同心之中求得自己所缺少的幸福，享受自己所向往的全部欢乐。反复的许诺使她深信所有希望一定会实现，大胆的爱抚和亲吻增加了本已充满她心中的欲望。她模模糊糊地意识到了全部的欢乐，预感到了全部的欢乐，身子于是飘飘然起来，心情紧张到了极点。终于，她伸出双臂去准备拥抱自己所渴望的一切。——可她的爱人却抛弃了她！她四肢麻木，神志迷乱，站立在深渊边上；她周围是一片漆黑，没有了希望，没有了安慰，没有了预感！要知道，他抛弃了她，那个唯一使她感觉到自己的存在意义的人抛弃了她。她看不见眼前的广大世界，看不见那许许多多可以弥补她这个损失的人；她感到自己在世上孤孤单单，无依无靠。被内心的可怕痛苦逼得走投无路了，她唯有闭起眼来往下一跳，以便在死神的怀抱里窒息掉所有的痛苦。——你瞧，阿尔伯特，这就是不少人的遭遇！难道能说，这不也是一种疾病么？在这混乱的、相互矛盾的力的迷津中，大自然也找不到出路，人就唯有一死。

“罪过啊，那种冷眼旁观，并且称她为傻瓜的人！这种人可能讲什么：她应该等一等，让时间来治好她的创伤，日子一久绝望定会消失，定会有另一个男人来给她以安慰。——可是，这不正像谁说：‘傻瓜，竟死于寒热病！他应该等一等，一当力量恢复，液体改善[28]，血液循环平稳下来，一切都好了，他就能活到今天！’”

阿尔伯特还是不觉得这个例子有说服力，又提出几点异议，其中一点是：我讲的只是个单纯的女孩子；可要是一个人眼光不这么狭隘，见多识广，头脑清楚，那他就不理解这个人怎么还能原谅。

“我的朋友，”我嚷起来，“人毕竟是人呵！一当他激情澎湃，受到了人类的局限的压迫，他所可能有的一点点理智便很难起作用，或者说根本不起作用。况且……以后再谈吧。”我说着，一边就抓起了自己的帽子。唉，我当时的心里真是充满了感慨！我和阿尔伯特分了手，但谁也没能理解谁。在这个世界上，人跟人真难于相互理解啊。





八月十五日


显然，在世界上，只有爱才能使一个人变得不可缺少。我从绿蒂的情况感觉出，她非常不愿失去我；孩子们心中更是只有一个想法，就是我明天一定还会去。今天我去为绿蒂的钢琴校音，但老动不了手，因为小家伙们一个劲儿地缠着我，要我给他们讲故事，而绿蒂自己也说，我应该满足他们的愿望。晚餐时，我给他们切面包，他们都高高兴兴地接过去吃起来，就像从绿蒂手中接过去的一样。然后，我给他们讲了那个得到一双神奇的手帮助的公主的故事，这是他们最爱听的。在讲的过程中，请你相信，我学到了许多东西。我感到惊讶，这个故事竟给他们留下了如此深刻的印象。因为每当我把一个细节忘记了，不得不自行编凑时，他们立刻就嚷起来：上次讲的可不是这样呵！弄得我现在只好反复练习，直至能一字不差地用唱歌的调子进行背诵。从这件事我得到一个教训：一位作家把书中的情节修改再版，即使艺术上出色得多了，都必然会给作品带来损害。我们总乐于接受第一个印象；人生来如此，即使最荒诞离奇的事，你都能叫他信以为真，并且一下子便记得牢牢的；而谁想去挖掉这个记忆，抹去这个记忆，谁就自讨苦吃！





八月十八日


能使人幸福的东西，同时又可以变成他痛苦的根源，难道就非得如此么？

对于生机勃勃的自然界，我心中曾有过强烈而炽热的感受，是它，曾使我欢欣雀跃，把我周围的世界变成了一个天国；可而今，它却残忍地折磨着我，成了一个四处追逐我的暴虐的鬼魅。想当初，我曾从高崖上眺望对岸那些丘陵间的富庶峡谷，看见面前的一切都生意盎然，欣欣向荣。我曾看见群山从山脚到峰顶都长满高大茂密的树木，迂回曲折的峡谷都覆盖着可爱的绿荫，河水从发出絮语的芦苇间缓缓流去，轻柔的晚风吹动着天空中冉冉飘过的白云，白云在河里投下倒影；接着，群鸟在林间发出晚噪，亿万只小昆虫在火红的夕晖中纵情舞蹈，落日的最后一瞥解放了草丛里的蟋蟀，它们唱起了歌；我周围的嗡嗡嘤嘤声使我低下头去看着地上，注意到了从坚硬的岩石里摄取养料的苔藓以及由干燥的沙丘上蔓生垂挂下来的藤萝，它们向我揭示了大自然内在的，炽烈而神圣的生命之谜。这一切的一切，我全包容在自己温暖的心里，感到自己像变成了神似的充实，辽阔无边的世界的种种美姿也活跃在我的心灵中，赋予一切以生机。环抱着我的是巍峨的群山，我脚边躺着道道幽谷，一挂挂瀑布飞泻而下，一条条小溪流水潺潺，树林和深山里百鸟声喧——这种种秘不可知的力量，我目睹它们在大地的怀抱中相互作用，相互影响；除此而外，在地球上，天空下，还一代一代繁衍着形形色色的生命。一切一切，应有尽有，千姿百态，最后还有人，他们为求安全而聚居在小小的房子里，却自以为能主宰这大千世界！可怜的傻瓜，你把一切都看得如此渺小，因为你自己就很渺小！——从高不可攀的群山，越过人迹未至的莽原，到世所不知的大洋的尽头，到处都有造物主的精神在空中流动，并为每一丁点能感知他的微末的生命而高兴。——唉，那时我是多么经常地渴望着，渴望借助从我头顶掠过的仙鹤的翅膀，飞向茫茫海洋的岸边，从那泡沫翻腾的无穷尽的酒杯中，啜饮令人心醉神迷的生之欢愉，竭尽自己胸中有限的力量，感受一下那位在自己体内和通过自己创造出天地万汇的伟大存在的幸福，哪怕仅仅在一瞬间！

朋友，单单回忆起过去的这些时光，我心中便很快乐；甚至想重新唤起和说出这些无法言说的感情的努力，便净化了我的灵魂；但是，接下来，也使我倍加感到自己目前处境的可怕。

仿佛有一面帷幕从我面前拉开了，广大的世界变成了一座张开着大口的墓穴。你能说：“这存在着”吗！唉，一切都在消失，一切都像闪电般一晃而逝，要么被洪流卷走、沉没，要么在礁石上撞得粉碎，很难真正耗尽各自的生命力。没有一个瞬间，不是在吞噬着你和你周围的亲人的生命；没有一个瞬间，你不是一个破坏者，不得不是一个破坏者：一次最无害的散步，将夺走千百个可怜的小虫子的生命；一投足，就会毁坏蚂蚁们辛辛苦苦营建起来的巢穴，把一个小小的世界踏成一片坟墓。嗨！使我痛苦的，不是世界上那些巨大但不常有的灾难，不是冲毁你们村庄的洪水，不是吞没你们城市的地震；戕害我心灵的，是大自然内部潜藏着的破坏力，这种力量所造就的一切，无不在损害着与它相邻的事物，无不在损害着自身。想到此，我忧心如焚。环绕着我的是天和地以及它们创造生命的力量；但在我眼中，却只有一个在永远不停地吞噬和反刍的庞然大物而已。





八月二十一日


清晨，我从睡梦中醒来，伸出双臂去拥抱她，结果抱了一个空。夜里，我做了一场梦，梦见我与她肩靠肩坐在草地上，手握着手，千百次地亲吻；可这幸福而无邪的梦却欺骗了我，我在床上找她不着。唉，我在半醒半睡的迷糊状态中伸出手去四处摸索，摸着摸着终于完全清醒了，两股热泪就从紧迫的心中迸出，我面对着黑暗的未来，绝望地痛哭。





八月二十二日


多不幸啊，威廉，我浑身充满活力，却偏偏无所事事，闲得心烦，既不能什么不干，又什么都不能干。我不再有想象力，不再有对自然界的敏感，书籍也令我生厌。一当我们失去了自主，便失去了一切。我向你发誓，我有时甚至希望当个短工，以便清晨一觉醒来，对未来的一天有个目标，有个追求，有个希望。我常常羡慕阿尔伯特，看见他成天埋头在公文堆中，心里就想，要是我能像他有多好啊！有几次我已动了念头，想给你和部长写信，请他把公使馆的差事留给我。如你所说，他是不会拒绝我的，我也这么相信。部长多年来就喜欢我，总是劝我找个事情做做；有一阵子我也认真准备这么办。可是事后再一考虑，我便想起了那则马的寓言，说的是它自由自在得不耐烦了，便请人给它装好鞍子，套上缰绳，结果让人骑得累得半死。这一想，我又不知如何是好了。——好朋友，我这要求改变现状的热望，莫不就是到处追逼着我的内心的烦躁不安吧？





八月二十八日


真的，如果我的病还有希望治好的话，那就唯有他们来医治。今天是我的生日，一大早我便收到了阿尔伯特差人送来的一个包裹。打开包裹，一个粉红色的蝴蝶结儿立刻跃入我眼帘。这是我初见绿蒂时她曾佩戴在胸前，以后我又多次请求她送给我的那个蝴蝶结呵！此外，包里还有两本六十四开的小书，威特施坦袖珍版的《荷马选集》，也是我久已想买的本子，以免在散步时老驮着埃尔涅斯特版的大部头。瞧，他们总是不等我开口就满足了我的愿望，总是想方设法向我作出友谊的表示。对我说来，这些小小的礼品比那种灿烂夺目的礼物贵重一千倍，因为后者只表明赠予者的矜夸，却贬低了我们的人格。我无数次地吻着那个蝴蝶结，每吸一口气，都吸到了对那为数不多的、一去不复返的日子用来充溢我身心的幸福的回忆。威廉啊，生活就是这样；而我也不抱怨，生命之花只是过眼烟云而已！多少花朵凋零了，连一点痕迹也不曾留下！能结果的何其少，果实能成熟的就更少了！不过，尽管如此，世间仍存在足够的果实；难道，我的兄长，难道我们能轻视这些已成熟的果实，对它不闻不问，不去享受它们，任它们白白腐烂掉么？

再见！此地的夏季很美，我常常坐在绿蒂家的园子里的果树上，手执摘果用的长杆，从树梢上的钩梨子。她站在树下，摘掉我钩给她的果实。





八月三十日


不幸的人呵！你可不是傻子吗？你可不是自我欺骗吗？这无休止的热烈渴慕又有何益？除了对她，我不再向任何人祷告；除了她的倩影，再没有任何形象出现在我的脑海里；我周围世界的一切，在我眼里全都与她有着关系。这样的错觉也曾使我幸福了一些时候，可到头来仍不得不与她分离！威廉呵，我的心时时渴望到她身边去！

我常两个小时、三个小时地坐在她身旁，欣赏着她优美的姿态举止，隽永的笑语言谈，所有的感官渐渐紧张到了极点，直至眼前发黑，耳朵任何声音都再听不见，喉头就像给谁扼住了似的难受，心儿狂跳着，渴望着使紧迫的感官松弛一下，结果反倒使它们更加迷乱。威廉啊，我这时候常常不知道，我是否还在这个世界上活着！有时候，抑郁的心情占了上风，要不是绿蒂允许我伏在她手上痛哭一场以舒积郁，从而得到可怜的一点点安慰的话，我就一定得离开她，一定得跑出去！随后，我便在广阔的田野里徘徊，攀登上一座陡峭的山峰，踯躅在没有路径的森林里，穿过满是荆棘的灌木丛，让它们刺破我的手脸，撕破我的衣履！这样，我心中会好受一点儿！但也就是这一点儿而已！有时，我又渴又累，倒卧途中；有时，在深夜寂静的林间，我头顶一轮满月，坐在一棵弯曲的树杆上，让我磨伤了的脚掌得到些许休息，接着，在黎明前的朦胧晦暝中，由困人的寂寥送入梦乡，沉沉睡去。威廉，修道士寂寞的斗室，赎罪者羊毛织成的粗衣和荆条编成的腰带，现在才是我灵魂渴求的甘露啊！再见了！我看这眼前的悲苦是无休无止，除非进入坟墓。





九月三日


我必须走了！谢谢你，威廉，是你坚定了我的决心，使我不再犹豫。十四天来，我就在转着离开她的念头。我必须走了。眼下她又在城里照护她的女友。而阿尔伯特……还有……我必须走了！





九月十日


那是怎样一个夜晚哟，威廉！现在我一切都可以克服了。我不会再见到她！此刻，我恨不得扑到你怀里，痛痛快快地哭一场，向你倾吐我激动的情怀，我的好友！我坐在这儿，为使自己平静下来而一口一口地吸着长气，同时期待着黎明快快来到；太阳一出，我的马匹就备好了。

唉，她会睡得很安稳，不会想到再也见不着我了。我终于坚强起来，离开了她，在两个小时的交谈中丝毫不曾泄露自己走的打算。上帝呵，那是怎样一次谈话啊！

阿尔伯特答应我，一吃完晚饭就和绿蒂一起到花园里来。我站在高高的栗子树下的土坡上，最后一次目送着夕阳西下，沉落到幽静的山谷和平缓的河流背后去。我曾多少次和她一起站在这儿，欣赏着同一幕壮丽景色呵；然而现在……

我在那条十分熟悉的林荫道上来回踱着；早在认识绿蒂以前，这条路便对我产生了某种神秘的吸引力，使我经常在此驻足；后来，在我俩认识之初，我们便发现彼此对这个地方都有着相同的爱好，当时的欣喜之情简直难以言说。这条林荫道，的确是我见过的一件最富浪漫情调的艺术杰作。

你一直要走到栗子树间，眼前才会豁然开朗。——啊，我想起了，我已经对你描写过许多次，告诉你那些高耸的山毛榉树怎样像墙一般把人围在中间，那林荫道怎样被两旁的小丛林遮挡着，显得越发幽暗，直到最后成为一个与世隔绝的小天地，寂静凄清，令人悚然。我还清楚记得第一次在正午走进去时的奇异心境；我当时隐隐约约预感到，这将是一个既让人尝到许多幸福，又让人体验无数痛苦的所在。

我怀着令人销魂的离情别绪，在那儿沉思了约莫半个小时，便听见他们从土坡下走来了。我跑上前去，在拉住她的手时不由一怔，但还是吻了吻。我们再登上土坡时，月亮也刚好从树影森森的山岗后面升了起来。我们谈着各种各样的事情，不觉已走到黑魆魆的凉亭前面。绿蒂跨进去坐下来，阿尔伯特坐在她身边，我也一样。然而，内心的不安叫我没法久坐。便站起身，走到她跟前，在那儿踱了一会儿，最后又重新坐下，那情形可真令人难受啊。这当儿，她让我们注意到美丽的月光，只见在我们面前的山毛榉树墙的尽头，整个土坡都被照得雪亮，加之是被包围在一片深邃的幽静中，那景象就更加鲜明悦目。我们全都沉默无语，过了好一阵她才又开口道：

“每当在月光下散步，我总不免想起自己已故的亲人，对死和未来的恐惧就一定会来袭扰我。我们都一定会死啊！”她声音激动地继续说，“可是维特，你说我们死后还会不会再见呢？见着了还能相互认识么？你的预感怎么样？你能说些什么？”

“绿蒂，”我说，同时把手伸给她，眼里噙满了泪水，“我们会再见的！在这儿和那儿都会再见！”

我讲不下去了。在我满怀离愁的时刻，威廉，难道她非这么问不可么！

“我们已故的亲人，”她继续问，“他们是否还记得我们呢？他们能不能感觉到，我们在幸福的时刻，总是怀着热爱想念他们呢？常常，在静静的夜晚，我坐在弟妹中间，像当年母亲坐在她的孩子们中间一样，孩子们围着我，像当年围着他们的母亲一样，这时候，我面前每每就会浮现出我母亲的形象。我呢，眼含渴慕的热泪，仰望空中，希望她能哪怕只看我一眼，看看我是如何信守在她临终时对她许下的诺言，代替她做孩子们的母亲的。我激动得几乎喊出声来：‘原谅我吧，亲爱的妈妈，要是我没能像您那样无微不至地关怀他们。唉，我已经做了能做的一切，照顾他们穿衣，照顾他们的饮食，更重要的，还保护他们，爱他们。亲爱的神圣的妈妈呀，你要能见到我们多么和睦就好了！你将怀着最热烈的感激之情赞美上帝，赞美你曾以临终的痛苦泪水，祈求他保佑你的孩子们的主……”

她这么讲啊讲啊，威廉！谁能够把她讲的都复述出来呢？这冷漠的、死的文字，怎能表达那灵智的精髓呵！

阿尔伯特温柔地打断她：

“你太激动了，亲爱的绿蒂！我知道，你心里老惦着这件事，不过我求你……”

“呵，阿尔伯特，”她说，“我知道你不会忘记那些个晚上，当时爸爸出门去了，孩子们已被打发上了床，我俩一块儿坐在那张小小的圆桌旁边，你手头常常捏着一本书，但却很难得读一读；要知道在这个世界上，有什么比和这个美丽的灵魂进行交流更重要呢？她是位秀丽、温柔、快活而不知疲倦的妇女。上帝知道，我多么经常流着热泪跪在自己床上，乞求他让我变成像她一样！”

“绿蒂！”我叫着，同时扑倒在她跟前，抓住她的手，眼泪簌簌滴到了她的手上，“绿蒂呵，上帝时刻保佑着你，还有你母亲在天之灵也保佑着你！”

“唉，你要是认识她就好了，”绿蒂紧握着我的手，说，“她值得你认识哪！”——听到这话，我自觉飘飘然起来；在此之前，我还从未受过更崇高，更可引以自豪的称赞哩。——她继续说：“可这样一位妇女，却不得不正当盛年就离开人世。那时候，她最小的儿子才六个月啊！她没有病多久，死的时候平静而安详，只有她的孩子们令她心疼，特别是最小的儿子。弥留之际，她对我讲：‘把他们给我领来吧。’我就把孩子们领进房去，小的几个还懵懵懂懂，大的几个也不知所措，全围着病榻站着。她举起手来为他们祝福，挨个儿吻了他们，然后便打发他们出去，一边却对我讲：‘你要做他们的母亲呵！’——我向她起了誓——‘你答应了像母亲似的关心他们，照料他们，这个担子可不轻呀，我的女儿！我自己经常从你感激的泪水看出，你已体会到做个母亲多么不易。对于你的弟妹，你要有母亲的慈爱；对于你的父亲，你要有妻子似的忠实与柔顺，并且成为他的安慰。她问父亲在哪儿。父亲为了不让我们看见他难以忍受的悲痛，已一个人出去；这男子汉也是肝肠寸断了啊。

“阿尔伯特，你当时也在房中。她见有人走动，便问是谁，并要求你走过去。她凝视着你和我，目光安详，流露出感到欣慰的神气，因为她知道我俩将在一起，幸福地在一起。”

阿尔伯特一把搂住绿蒂的脖子，吻她，吻了又嚷：

“我们现在是幸福的！将来也会幸福！”

冷静的阿尔伯特一时间竟失去了自制，我更完全忘乎所以。

“维特呵，”她又继续讲，“上帝却让这样一位夫人离开了人世！我有时想，当我们眼看自己生命中最亲爱的人被夺走时，没有谁的感受比孩子们更痛切的了。后来，我的弟妹很久很久还在对人诉说，是一些穿黑衣的男人把妈妈给抬走啦！”

她站起身来，我才恍如大梦初醒，同时深为震惊，因此仍呆坐在那儿，握着她的手。

“咱们走吧，”她说，“时候不早了。”她想缩回手去，我却握得更紧。

“我们会再见的，”我叫道，“我们会再相聚，不论将来变成什么样子，都能彼此认出来的。我要走了，心甘情愿地走了，”我继续说，“可要我说永远离开你们，我却无此毅力。保重吧，绿蒂！保重吧，阿尔伯特！我们会再见的！”

“我想就在明天吧。”她开玩笑说。

天哪！这个“明天”多够我受！可她在抽回手去时，还压根儿不知道哩……

他俩走出了林荫道；我仍呆呆立着，目送着他们在月光下的背影，随后却扑倒在地上，痛哭失声，一会儿又一跃而起，奔上土坡，从那儿，还看见她的白色衣裙，在高高的菩提树下的阴影里闪动，可等我再伸出手去时，她的倩影已消失在园门中。

第二编


一七七一年十月二十日


我们昨天抵达此地。公使觉着身体不舒服，要在家里休息几天。他要是脾气随和些，就一切都好了。我发现，一再地发现，命运总是安排给我种种严峻的考验。可要鼓起勇气啊！心情一轻松，便什么都能忍受了。好个心情轻松，这话竟然出自我的笔下，简直令人好笑！唉，岂知我只需心情稍微轻松一点儿，就可以成为天底下最幸福的人。可不是么，别人有一点点能力，一点点才分，便到处夸夸其谈，沾沾自喜，我干吗还要悲观失望，怀疑自己的能力和天赋呢？仁慈的上帝，是你赐予了我这一切；可你为什么不少给我一半才能，多给我一丁点自信与自足哟！

别急！别急！情况会好起来的。告诉你，好朋友，你的意见完全对。自从我每天在人们中间忙忙碌碌，看见他们干什么和怎么干以来，我的心绪已经好多了。的确，我们生来就爱拿自己和其他人反反复复比较；所以，我们是幸福或是不幸，全取决于我们与之相比的是些什么人；所以，最大最大的危险，就莫过于孤身独处了。我们的脑子生就是朝上想的，加之受到诗里的幻境的激发，便常常臆造出一些地位无比优越于我们的人来，好像他们个个都比自己杰出，个个都比自己完美。而且这似乎理所当然。经常地，我们感到自己身上有这样那样的缺陷；在我们看来，我们所欠缺的，别人偏偏都有。不仅如此，我们还把自己所有的品质全加在他们身上，外搭着某种心满意足。这样，一个幸福的人就完成了，只不过是我们自己的创造而已。

反之，如果我们不顾自己的衰弱和吃力，只管一个劲儿往前赶，我们常常便会发现，我们虽然步履踉跄，不断迷路，却仍比其他又张帆又划桨的人走得远——而且，一当你与其他人并驾齐驱，或者甚至超越了他们，你就会真正感觉到自身的价值。





十一月二十六日


我开始勉勉强强适应了此地的生活。最使我高兴的，是这儿有足够的事干；此外，还有许许多多的人，百态千姿，形形色色，恰似在对着我的灵魂演出一场热闹的趣剧。我已经结识了C伯爵，一位令我日益尊敬的博学而杰出的男子，他见多识广，所以对人就不冷漠；从他的待人接物，可以明显看出是很重感情和友谊的。我有一次奉命去他府上公干，他便表现出对我有好感，一经交谈，他更发现我们相互理解，发现他可以同我像同他的少数知心朋友似的倾谈。还有他对人态度之坦率，我怎么称赞也不为过。世间最纯粹、最暖人胸怀的乐事，恐怕莫过于看见一颗伟大的心灵对自己开诚相见吧。





十二月二十四日


公使给了我许多烦恼，这是我预料到的。像他似的吹毛求疵的傻瓜，世上找不出第二个。一板一眼，啰里啰唆，活像个老太婆；他这人从来没有满意自己的时候，因此谁也甭想多会儿能称他的心。我喜欢的可是干事爽快麻利，是怎样就怎样；他呢，却有本事把文稿退还给我，说什么“文章嘛写得倒挺好，不过您不妨再看看，每看一遍总可以找到一个更漂亮的句子，一个更适合的小品词”。——这真叫我气得要死。任何一个“和”，任何一个连词，你都甭想省去；我偶尔不经意用了几个倒装句，他都拼命反对；要是你竟把他那些长套句换了调调，他更会摆出一副完全摸不着头脑的样子，和这样一个人打交道，真叫受罪啊。

只有C伯爵的信任，才给我以安慰。最近他开诚布公地告诉我，他对我这位公使的拖沓与多疑也很不满。“这种人不仅自讨苦吃，也给人家添麻烦。不过，”他说，“我们必须听天由命。这就像旅行者不得不翻一座山，这座山要是不存在，路走起来自然舒坦得多，也短得多；可它既然已经存在，那你就必须翻过去！”

我那老头子心里明白，比起他来伯爵更器重我。他对此十分生气，一抓住机会就当着我的面讲伯爵的坏话；我呢，自然便要为伯爵辩护，这一来事情只会更糟。昨天我简直叫他惹火了，因为他下面的一席话，捎带着把我也给骂了进去。他说，伯爵处理起事务来还算行，非常干练，笔头嘛也来得，可就是缺少渊博的学识，跟所有文人一样。讲这话时，他那副神气仿佛在问：“怎么样，刺痛你了吧？”我才不吃这一套哩；我鄙视一个像这样思想和行动的人，便与他针锋相对，毫不让步。我道，无论品性或是学识，伯爵都是位理应受到尊重的人。“在我所有相识者中，”我说，“没有谁像他那样心胸开阔，见多识广，同时又精于日常事务的。”——我这话在老头子无异于对牛弹琴；为了避免闲扯下去再找气怄，我就告辞了。

瞧，全都怪你们不是。是你们唠唠叨叨，劝我来戴上了这副重轭，成天价在我耳边念“要有所作为呀”，“要有所作为呀”。要有所作为！如果一个种出马铃薯来运进城去卖的农民，他不就已经比我更有作为的话，我也甘愿在眼下这条囚禁我的苦役船上再受十年罪。

还有那班麇集此间的小市民们的虚伪与无聊！他们是如此斤斤计较等级，无时无刻不在瞅着抢到别人前头去一步的机会，以致这种最可悲、最低下的欲望，竟表现得赤裸裸的。比如有一个女人，她逢人便讲她的贵族血统和领地，使每个不谙内情者都只能当她是白痴，要不怎么会神经失常，把自己那点儿贵族的血液和世袭的领地竟看得如此了不起。——更糟糕的是，这个女的偏偏只是本地一名书记官的千金。——是啊，我真不明白这类人，他们怎么竟如此没有廉耻。

不过，好朋友，我一天比一天看得更加清楚，以自己去衡量别人是很愚蠢的。何况我本身有的是伤脑筋的事儿，我这颗心真叫不平静呵——唉，我真乐于让人家走人家的路，只要他们也让我走自己的路就成。

最令我恼火的是市民阶层的可悲处境。尽管我和任何人一样，也清楚了解等级差别是必要的，它甚至还给我本人带来了不少好处，可是，它却偏偏又妨碍着我，使我不能享受这世界上仅存的一点点欢乐，一星星幸福。最近，我在散步时认识了封·B小姐；她是一位在眼前的迂腐环境中仍不失其自然天性的可爱姑娘。我和她谈得十分投机，临别时请她允许我上她家去看她。她大大方方地答应了，使我更加急不可耐地等着约定的时间到来。她并非本地人，住的是一位姑母家里。老太太的长相我一见就不喜欢，但仍然对她十分敬重，多数时间都在和她周旋。可是不到半小时，我便摸清了她的底细，而事后封·B小姐也向我承认了。原来亲爱的姑妈老来事事不如意，既无一笔符合身份的产业，也无智慧和可依靠的人，有的只是一串祖先的名字和可资凭借的贵族地位，而她唯一的消遣，就是从她的楼上俯视脚下的市民的脑袋。据说她年轻时倒是很俊俏的，只是由于行事太诡，才毁了自己的一生，开始一意孤行，把不少倒霉的小青年折磨得够呛；后来上了几分年纪，就只好屈就一位软耳根的军官啦。此人以这个代价和一笔勉强够用的生活费，和她一道度过了那些艰辛的岁月。随后他就一命呜呼，丢下了她孤零零一个人，眼下的日子同样艰辛。要不是她那外甥女如此可爱的话，谁还高兴来瞅她一瞅啊。





一七七二年一月八日


真不知这是些什么人，整个的心思都系挂在那种种繁文缛节上，成年累月盘算和希冀的只是怎样才能在宴席上把自己的座位往上挪一把椅子。并非他们除此别无事做；相反，事情多得成堆，恰恰是为忙那些无聊的琐事去了，才顾不上干重要的事。上星期，在乘雪橇出游时便发生了争吵，结果大为扫兴。

这班傻瓜哟，他们看不出位置先后本身毫无意义；看不出坐第一把交椅的，很少是第一号角色！古往今来，不知有多少君王受自己宰相的支配，有多少宰相又被他秘书所驾驭！在这种情况下，谁是第一号人物呢？我认为是那个眼光超过常人，有足够的魄力和心计把别人的力量与热情全动员起来实现自己计划的人。





一月二十日


亲爱的绿蒂，我刚才为避一场暴风雪逃进了一家乡村小客栈；只有到了这儿，我才能给你写信。多久我还困在D城那可悲的窠巢里，忙碌在那班对于我的心来说完全是陌生的人们中间，多久我的心就不会叫我写信给你。可眼下，在这所茅屋中是如此寂寞，如此湫隘，雪和冰雹正扑打着我的小窗，在这儿我的第一个思念却是你。我一踏进门，你的倩影便出现在我的眼前，唤起了我对你的回忆，绿蒂呵，那么神圣，那么温馨的回忆！仁慈的上帝，这是许久以来你赐予我的第一个幸福时刻啊！

亲爱的，你哪知道我已变得多么心神不定，知觉麻木！我的心没有一刻充实，没有一刻幸福！空虚呀！空虚呀！我好像站在一架西洋镜前，看见人儿马儿在我眼前转来转去，不禁经常问自己，这是不是光学把戏呢？其实，我自己也参加了玩这把戏，或者更正确地说，也像个木偶似的被人玩，偶尔触到旁边一个人的木手，便吓得战栗着缩了回来。晚上，我下决心要享受日出，到了早晨却起不来床；白天，我希望能欣赏月色，天黑了又待在房中出不去。我闹不明白，我干吗起身，干吗就寝。

我的生活缺少了酵母；使我深夜仍精神饱满，一大早就跳下床来的兴奋剂已不知抛到了何处。

在此地我只结识了一个女子，一位名叫封·B的小姐；她就像你啊，亲爱的绿蒂，如果说谁还能像你的话。“哎，”你会说，“瞧这人才会献殷勤哩！”——此话倒也并非完全不对；一些时候以来，我的确变得有礼貌多了，机灵多了——不如此不行呵——。所以女士们讲：谁也不如我会说奉承话。“还有骗人的话。”你会补充说。可是，不如此不行呵，你懂吗？——让我还是讲封·B小姐吧。她是一个重感情的姑娘，这从她那一双明亮的蓝眼睛里可以看出来。她的贵族身份只是她的负担，满足不了她的任何一个愿望。她渴望离开扰攘的人群，我不止一次陪着她幻想过田园生活的纯净的幸福，啊，还幻想过你！她是多么经常地不得不崇拜你呵。不，不是不得不，而是自愿；她非常愿意听我讲你的情况，并且爱你。

呵，我真愿能再坐在你脚边，坐在那间舒适可爱的小房间里，看着我们亲爱的孩子们在我的周围打闹嬉戏！要是你嫌他们吵得太厉害，我就可以让他们聚到我身边来，安安静静听我讲一个可怕的故事。

美丽的夕阳慢慢沉落在闪着雪光的原野上，暴风雪过去了，而我呢，又必须把自己关进我那笼子里去……

再见！阿尔伯特和你在一起吗？你究竟过得……上帝饶恕我提这个问题！





二月八日


八天来天气坏得不能再坏，但对于我却太好啦。须知，自从我到此地以后，还没有一个天气好的日子不是让人破坏了或者搞得不痛快的。“哈，这会儿你尽管下雨、飞雪、降霜、结冰好了，”我想，“我反正待在屋子里也不会比外面坏，或者恰恰相反，倒好一些。”每当早上太阳升起，预示着有一个好日子的时候，我便忍不住要嚷：“今儿个上帝又降了一个恩惠，好让他们去你抢我夺啦！”他们互相抢夺着健康、荣誉、欢乐和休息，而且这样做多半是出于愚昧无知和心胸狭隘；可你要听他们讲起来，存心却又像好得不能再好了。我有时真想跪下去求他们，别这么发疯似的大动肝火好不好。





二月十七日


我担心，我的公使与我共事不长了。这个简直叫你受不了。他办公和处理问题的方式十分可笑，我常常禁不住要讲出自己的看法来，或者干脆按照自己的想法和方式行事，结果自然从来不能令他满意。最近他到宫里去告了我，部长也就给了我一个申斥，虽说相当和缓，但申斥毕竟是申斥。我已准备提出辞呈，这当口却收到了他的一封亲笔信[1]；这是一封怎样的信呵！在它所包含的崇高、高尚和英明的思想面前，我不能不五体投地。他责备我有失偏激。他说，我对办事效率、对影响他人、对干预政务等等问题的想法，固然表现了年轻人的朝气，值得尊重，但是却操之过急；因此，他并不准备叫我打消这些想法，而只希望使它们和缓一点，只希望引导它们，让它们发挥好影响，产生积极切实的作用。真的，有八天之久，我感到深受鼓舞，心情格外舒畅。内心的平静确是一件珍宝，简直就是欢乐本身。亲爱的朋友，要是这珍宝既贵重美丽，又不易破碎就好喽！





二月二十日


上帝保佑你们，亲爱的朋友！愿他把他从我这儿夺去的好日子，统统赐予你们吧。

我感谢你，阿尔伯特，感谢你瞒着我。我一直等着你们结婚的消息；我已下定决心，一当这大喜的日子到来，就将郑重其事地从墙上把绿蒂那张剪影像取掉，藏到其他画片中间去。喏，眼下你们已经成为眷属，可她的像仍然挂在这里；…是的，还要让它一直挂下去！为什么不呢？我知道，我也仍然存在于你们那儿，存在于绿蒂心中，但并未妨碍你，是的，我在她心中占据着第二个位置，并且希望和必须把这个位置保持下去。呵，要是她把我忘了，我就会发疯的……这个想法太可怕，阿尔伯特。再见，阿尔伯特！再见，绿蒂，我的天使！





三月十五日


我触了一个霉头，看起来是非离开此地不可啦。我咬牙切齿！见鬼！事情绝无补救，而要怨就只能怨你们。是你们鼓动我，催促我，折磨我，使我接受了这份与我性情不合的差事。这下我可好了！这下你们可好了！为了不让你讲什么又是我思想偏激才把一切弄糟了的，现在我请你，亲爱的先生，听听下面这段简短有趣的故事，它将是原原本本的纪实。

C伯爵喜欢我，器重我，这你知道，我已经对你讲过上百遍了。就在昨天，我在他府上吃饭，可没想到正巧碰着个当地的贵族男女晚上要来他家聚会的日子；再说我也从来没留心，像我们这样的小人物是不容插足他们的集会的。好啦。我在伯爵府上吃饭，饭后我们在大厅中踱起步来，我和伯爵谈话，和一位后来的上校谈话，不知不觉间聚会的时候就到了。天晓得，我却压根儿没想到呵。这当口，最最高贵的封·S太太率领着自己的丈夫老爷以及她那只孵化得很好的小鹅——一位胸部扁平、纤腰迷人的千金走进来了，并且在经过我身边时高高扬着他们那世袭贵族的眼睛和鼻孔。我打心眼儿里讨厌这号人，因此打算一等伯爵与他们寒暄完就去向他告辞，谁知这时我那B小姐又进来了。我每次一见她总感几分欣喜，便留下来，站在她的椅子背后，过了好一会儿才发现她和我交谈不如平时随便，样子也颇尴尬。我觉得奇怪。“原来她也跟那班家伙一样哩。”我暗想，不禁生起气来，准备马上走；可我仍留下了，因为我很希望是错怪了她，不相信她真会如此，希望能从她口里听见一句好话，并且……谁知还希望什么。这其间，聚会的人已经到齐：有穿戴着参加弗朗茨一世[2]加冕时的全套盛装的F男爵，有带着自己的聋子老婆、在这种场合被郑重地称为封·R大人的宫廷顾问R等等，此外，还不应忘记提到捉襟见肘的J，他在自己满是窟窿的老古董礼服上，打着许多时新的补丁。聚到一块儿的就是这种人物。我与其中几个我认识的攀谈，他们全都爱理不理。我想……我只留心着我的B小姐，没注意到女人们都凑到大厅的头上，在那儿叽叽咕咕地咬耳朵；没注意到，后来男人们也受了传染；没注意到，封·S夫人一个劲地在对伯爵讲什么（这些情形全是事后B小姐告诉我的），直到伯爵终于向我走来，把我领到一扇窗户跟前。

“您了解我们的特殊处境，”他说，“我发现，参加聚会的各位对您在场感到不满。我本人可是说什么也不想……”

“阁下，”我抢过话头说，“千万请您原谅；我早该想到才是呵。不过我知道，您会恕我失礼的。我本早想告辞，却让一个恶灵给留住了。”我微笑着补充道，同时鞠了一躬。

伯爵含意深长地紧紧握着我的手。我不声不响地出了一帮贵族聚会的大厅，到得门外，坐上一辆轻便马车，向着M地驶去。在那儿，我一边从山上观赏落日，一边读着我的荷马，听他歌唱俄底修斯如何受着好客的牧猪人的款待。一切都是如此的美好啊。

傍晚回寓所吃饭，在客厅里只剩几个人。他们挤在一个角落里掷骰子，把桌布都翻了起去。这当儿为人诚恳的阿德林走进来，脱下帽子，一见我就靠拢来低声说：

“你碰钉子了？”

“我？”我问。

“可不是，伯爵把你从集会里赶出来啦。”

“见他们的鬼去！”我说，“我倒宁肯出来呼吸呼吸新鲜空气哪。”

“这样就好，你能不在乎。”他说，“可令我讨厌的是，眼下已经闹得满城风雨。”

到这时候，我才感觉不自在起来。所有来进餐的人都盯着我瞧，我想原因就在这里吧！这才叫恼人呵。

甚至在今天，我走到哪儿，哪儿的人都对我表示同情；我还听见一些本来嫉恨我的人洋洋得意地讲：“这下瞧见了，那种妄自尊大的家伙会有怎样的下场。他们凭着点小聪明就自以为了不起，把一切全不放在眼中……”诸如此类的混账话还有的是。我真恨不得抓起刀来，刺进自己的心窝里去；要知道你们尽可以说什么自行其是，不予理睬，可我倒想看看，有谁能忍受占了上风的无赖们对自己说东道西。他们的话要是凭空捏造，唉，那倒也罢了。





三月十六日


所有的事情都叫我生气。今天我在大街上碰见B小姐，忍不住招呼了她。一当我们离开人群远了点，我就向她发泄对她最近那次态度的不满。

“呵，维特，”她语气亲切地说，“既然你了解我的心，怎么还能这样解释我当时的狼狈不安呢？从跨进大厅的一刻起，我就多么为你难受啊！我已预见到后来发生的一切，话到舌头无数次，只差对你讲出来。我知道，封·S和封·T宁肯带着她们的男人退场，也不愿和你在一起。我知道，伯爵也不好得罪他们……眼下可热闹啦！”

“眼下怎样了，B小姐？”我问，同时掩饰着内心的恐惧；而前天阿德林给我讲的一切，此刻就像沸腾的开水似地在我血管里急速流动起来。

“你可害得我好苦呵！”说着说着，可爱的人儿眼里就噙满了泪水。

我再控制不住自己，已准备跪倒在她脚下。

“请你有话就说出来吧。”我嚷道。

泪珠顺着她的脸颊往下淌，我完全失去了自制。她擦着眼泪，一点没有掩饰的意思。

“你知道我姑妈，”她开始讲，“当时她也在场，并且以怎样的目光盯着你哟！维特，我昨天晚上好不容易才熬过来，今儿一天又为和你交往挨了一顿训。我还不得不听着她贬低你，辱骂你，一点不能为你辩解，不好为你辩解。”

B小姐说的每一句话，都像剑一样刺痛我的心。她体会不到，如果不提这一切对我来说是多么大的仁慈。现在她又告诉我人家还有哪些流言蜚语，以及谁谁谁将因此洋洋得意。她说，那些早就指责我傲气和目中无人的家伙，眼下对于我受的报应真是心花怒放，乐不可支。听着她，威廉，听着她以怀着真诚同情的声调讲这些……我当时气得肺都炸了，眼下也仍然怒火中烧。我那会儿真希望有谁站出来指责我，这样我便可以一刀戳穿他；也许见了血，我的心中会好受些。呵，我曾上百次地抓起刀来，想要刺破自己的胸膛，以舒心中的闷气。人说有一种宝马，当骑手驱赶过急，它便会本能地咬破自己的血管，使呼吸变得舒畅一些。我的情形经常也就如此，真巴不得切开自己的一条动脉，以便获得永远的自由。





三月二十四日


我已向宫里要求辞职，希望能得到批准；我没有事先征得你们同意，谅必你们不会怪罪我吧。我反正是非走不可了；而你们为劝我留下可能说的话，我也都知道……对了，请你把此事尽可能委婉地告诉我母亲，我自己已是无计可施，如果不能使她称心，那就只有求她原谅。自然，这必定会叫她难过：眼看自己儿子业已开始的做枢密顾问和公使的美好前程就此断送，前功尽弃！你们爱怎么想就怎么想好了，任随想出几多我可以留下和应该留下的理由，一句话，我反正得走。为了让你们知道我的去向，我就告诉你，这儿有一位侯爵，他很乐于和我结交。当他得知我辞职的打算以后，便邀我到他猎庄上去，和他共度明媚的春天。他答应到时候让我自便，加之我们在一起还相互有某种程度的理解，我就想碰碰运气，随他一块儿去。

补记


四月十九日


感谢你的两封来信。我迟迟未作回答，是因为我把这封信压下了，一直等到辞呈批下来；我担心母亲会去找部长，使我的打算难以实现。眼下可好了，辞呈已经摆在面前。我不想告诉你们，上边是多么不愿意批准它，以及部长在信中写了些什么话；否则，你们又该抱怨开来。亲王赠我二十五个杜卡盾，作为解职金，我感动得几乎掉下泪来。这就是说，我不需要母亲再寄给我最近信上要的那笔钱了。





五月五日


我明天就要离开这儿；因为我的故乡离途经的某地只有六英里，我于是打算再去看看它，回忆回忆那些业已逝去的充满幸福梦想的日子。想当年，父亲故去以后，母亲领着我离开可爱的家园，把自己关进了城里；如今我又要走进她曾领着我出来的同一道门里去。再见，威廉，我在途中会给你写信的。





五月九日


我怀着朝圣者的虔敬心情，完成了我的故乡之行；一些意想不到的情感曾在我心中油然而生。在出城向S地走一刻钟处的那株大菩提树旁，我叫车夫停了下来。我下了车，打发邮车继续往前走，自己准备步行，以便随心所欲地唤起对往事的回忆，尽情地加以重温。瞧我又站在这株菩提树下啦！儿时，我曾无数次地以它为散步的终点和目的。世事无常！当初，无知而幸福的我多么渴望到那陌生的世界里去，为我的心寻找丰富的营养，无尽的享受，使我郁闷焦躁的胸怀得以舒畅，得到满足；如今，我从广大的世界上归来，我的朋友呵，可希望已一个个破灭，理想也尽皆消亡！

我看见那些山峰仍兀立眼前，我曾多少次希望去攀登它们呵！我曾几小时几小时地坐在这菩提树下，心儿却已飞过山去，尽情地神游在山后的森林与峡谷中；在我眼里，它们显得如此亲切，如此神秘。每当到了回家的时刻，我又多么恋恋不舍，不愿离开这可爱的所在呵！

离城渐渐近了。所有古老的、熟悉的花园小屋都得到了我的问候，而新建的却令我反感，一如其他所有由人造成的变化。我穿过城门，一下子就感觉自己到了家。好朋友，我不想细谈；这些对我具有极大魅力的事物，讲出来却会十分单调乏味。我决定下榻在市集广场上，紧靠着我们家的老屋。我在散步时发现，我们被一位认真的老太太塞在里边度过了童年时代的教室，如今已变成一家杂货铺。我回味着在这间小屋里经历过的不安，悲伤，迷惘和恐惧。——几乎每跨一步，我都能遇上吸引我注意的事物；即使一个朝圣者到了圣城，也找不到如许多值得纪念的地方，他的心也很难充满如许多神圣的激情呵。——仅再举千百件经历中的一件为例。我沿河而下，走到了有一个农场的地方；从前我也常来这儿，我们男孩子们练习用扁平的石块在河面上打水漂儿。我还记忆犹新的是，我有时站在江边目送着江水，心中充满了奇妙的预感，脑子里想象着江水正要流去的不可思议的地域，但很快便发现自己的想象力到了尽头；尽管如此，我仍然努力想下去，直到终于忘情在一个看不见的远方。——你瞧，朋友，我们那些杰出的祖先尽管孤陋寡闻，却也非常幸福！他们的感情和诗是那么天真！当俄底修斯讲到无垠的大海和无边的大地时，他的话是那么真实、感人、诚挚、幼稚而又十分神秘。现在，我可以和每一个学童讲，地球是圆的，可这对我又有何用处呢？人只需要小小一块土地，便可以在上边安安乐乐；而为了得到安息，他所需的地方就更小了。

眼下我已住在侯爵的猎庄上。这位爵爷待人真诚随和，倒也十分好处。可在他周围，却有一些令我简直莫名其妙的怪人。他们似乎并非奸诈之徒，但又没有正派人的样子。有时候，我也觉得他们是诚实的，但仍不能予以信赖。最令我感觉不快的是，侯爵经常人云亦云，高谈阔论，讲一些听到和读到的东西。

再说，他之重视我的智慧和才气，也胜过重视我的心；殊不知我的心才是我唯一的骄傲，才是我的一切力量、一切幸福、一切痛苦以及一切一切的唯一源泉！唉，我知道的东西谁都可以知道；而我的心却为我所独有。





五月二十五日


我脑子里有过一个计划；但在它实现以前，我本不想告诉你。现在反正不会成功，说说也无妨。我曾经希望去从军！这个想法在我心中久已有之；我所以追随侯爵来到他庄上，主要目的也在于此，因为他是×××地方的现役将军。一次在散步时，我把自己的打算透露给他；他劝我打消这个念头，说除非我真的有此热情，而不是一时胡思乱想，否则我就必须听从他的规劝。





六月十一日


随你讲什么吧，反正我是待不下去了。你要我在这儿干吗呢？日子长得叫我难过。至于侯爵，他待我要说多好有多好，可我仍然感到不自在。归根到底，我们之间毫无共同之处。他是个有理解力的人，但也仅仅是平平庸庸的理解力罢了；与他交往带给我的愉快，不见得比读一本好书来得多。我打算再待八天，然后又四处漂泊去。我在此间干的最有意义的事是作画。侯爵颇具艺术感受力；他要不是受讨厌的科学概念和流行术语的局限，对艺术的理解就会更深刻一些。有不少次，正当我兴致勃勃地领着他在自然与艺术之宫中畅游，他却突然自作聪明，从嘴里冒出一句艺术行话来，把直我恨得牙痒痒的。





六月十六日


唉，我不过是个漂泊者，是个在地球上来去匆匆的过客！难道你们就不是么？





六月十八日


我打算去哪儿？让我对你说实话吧。我不得不在此地再逗留十四天，然后准备考虑去参观×地的一些矿井；但参观矿井压根儿不算回事，目的还是想借此离绿蒂近一些，如此而已。我自己也不禁笑起自己这颗心来；但笑尽管笑，却仍然迁就了它。





七月二十九日


不，这样很好！好得无以复加！……我……她的丈夫！呵，上帝，是你创造了我，要是你还给了我这么个福分，那我这一生除了向你祈祷以外，便什么也不再做。我不想反抗命运，饶恕我的这些眼泪，饶恕我的这些痴心妄想吧！——她做我的妻子！要是我能拥抱这个天底下最可爱的人儿，那我就……

每当阿尔伯特搂住她纤腰的时候，呵，威廉，我的全身便会不寒而栗。

然而，我可以道出真情吗，威廉？为什么不可以？她和我在一起会比和他在一起幸福啊！他不是那个能满足她心中所有愿望的人。他这人缺乏敏感，缺乏某种……随你怎么理解吧，总之，在读到一本好书的某个片断时，他的心不会产生强烈的共鸣，像我的心和绿蒂的心那样；还有，经常地，当我们发表对另外某个人的行为的感想时，情况同样如此。亲爱的威廉！他虽说也专心一意地爱着她，但这样的爱尽可以获得任何别的报偿啊！

一个讨厌的来访者打断了我。我的泪水已经擦干，心也乱了。再见，好朋友！





八月四日


不只我一个人的处境是这样。所有的人都失望了，所有的人都遭到了命运的欺骗！我去看望住在菩提树下那位贤惠的妇人。她的大儿子跑上来迎接我；听见他的欢叫声，母亲也走了出来，一副垂头丧气的模样。她第一句话就告诉我：“先生，我的汉斯已经死了”——汉斯是她最小的一个儿子。我无言以对。——“还有我的丈夫，”她继续说，“他也两手空空地从瑞士回家来，要不是遇着些好人，他不讨饭才怪哩。他在半道上得了寒热病。”——我不知对她说什么好，只送了一点儿钱给她的小孩；她请我收下几只苹果，我接过了，带着忧伤的回忆离开了那地方。





八月二十一日


一眨眼，我的境况完全变了。有几次，我眼前又闪现过生活的欢愉的光辉，可惜转瞬即逝！——每当我堕入忘我的梦幻中，我便禁不住产生一个想法：“要是阿尔伯特死了又将怎样呢？你会的！是的，她也会……”随后，我便跟着自己的胡思乱想追去，直至被领到悬崖边上，吓得浑身战栗着往后退。

我出得门来，循着当初去接绿蒂参加舞会的大路走啊走啊，可是已经面目全非！一切已如过眼云烟！没有留下昔日世界的一丝痕迹，半缕情绪。我的心境恰似一个回到自己宫堡中来的幽灵：想当初，他身为显赫的王侯，建造了这座宫堡，对它极尽豪华装饰之能事，后来临终时又满怀希望地把它遗留给自己的爱子；看眼前，昔日的辉煌建筑已烧成一片废墟。





九月三日


我有时真不能理解，怎么还有另一个人能够爱她，可以爱她；要知道我爱她爱得如此专一，如此深沉，如此毫无保留，除她以外，我就什么也不知道，什么也不了解，什么也没有了呵！





九月四日


是的，就是这样，正如自然界已转入秋天，我的心中和我的周围也已一派秋意。我的树叶即将枯黄，而邻近我的那些树木却在落叶了。我上次刚到此地，不是对你讲过一个青年农民么？这次在瓦尔海姆我又打听他的情况，人家告诉我，他已被解雇了；此外就谁也不肯再讲什么。昨天，在通往邻村的路上，我碰见他，与他打招呼，他于是给我讲了他的故事。要是我现在再讲给你听，你将很容易理解，这个故事为何令我感动不已。可是，我干吗要讲这一切，干吗不把所有令我担忧、令我难受的事情藏在自己心中，而要让你和我一样不痛快呢？干吗我要给你一次一次机会，让你来怜悯我，骂我呢？随它去吧，这也许是我命中注定了的！

经我问起，这青年农民才带着默默的哀愁——我看还有几分羞怯——讲起他自己的事。但一讲开，他就突然像重新认识了自己和我似的，态度变得坦率起来，向我承认了自己的错误，并开始抱怨他的不幸。我的朋友，我现在请你来判断他的每一句话吧！

他承认，不，他是带着一种回忆往事的甜蜜和幸福的神情在追述，他对自己女东家的感情如何与日俱增，弄到后来六神无主，不知道自己该做什么，该说什么。他吃不进，喝不下，睡不着，嗓子眼好似给堵住了一样。人家不让他做的事，他做了；人家吩咐他做的事，他又给忘了，恰像有个恶灵附了体。直到有一天，他知道她在阁楼上，便跟着追了去，或者更确切地说，被吸引了去。由于她怎么也不听他的请求，他自己也不知怎么搞的，竟想对她动起蛮来；不过上帝做证，他对她的存心始终是正大光明的，别无其他欲念，只是想娶她做老婆，让她和他一起过日子而已。因为已经讲了相当久，他开始结巴起来，就像一个还有话讲但又不好说出口的人似的。最后，他还是很难为情地向我坦白，她允许了他对自己作一些小小的亲热表示，让他成为她的知己。他曾两三次中断叙述，插进来反复申辩说，他讲这些不是想败坏她的名誉；他并且表示，他仍像过去一样地爱她，尊重她，要不是为了叫我相信他并非完全是个头脑发昏的家伙，他才不会把这些事泄露出来哪。

喏，好朋友，我又要重弹我永远弹不厌的老调了：要是我能让你想象出这当时站在我跟前、眼下也仍像站在我跟前的人是个啥样子，那该多好呵！要是我能正确地讲述一切，让你感觉出我是如何同情他的命运，不得不同情他的命运，那该多好呵！总之，由于你了解我的命运，也了解我本人，你就会十分清楚地知道，是什么使我的心向着一切不幸者，尤其是这个不幸的青年农民。

我在重读此信时，发现忘记了讲故事的结尾；而结尾如何，是很容易猜想的。女东家没有同意他，她的兄弟也插了手。此人早就恨他，早就巴不得把他撵走，生怕自己姐姐一改嫁，他的孩子们就会失去财产继承权；她本身没有子女，所以他们眼下是大有望头的。这位舅老爷不久便赶走了年轻人，并且大肆张扬，闹得女东家本人即便再想找他回去也不可能了。眼下她已另雇了一个长工；而为着这个长工，据说她又和自己的弟弟吵翻了，人家断定她会嫁给他，可她弟弟却死活不答应。

我对你讲的一切绝无夸大，绝无涂脂抹粉；相反，倒可以说讲得不好，不来劲儿，而且是用我们听惯了的无伤大雅的语言在讲，也就失去了原有的情致。

这样的爱情，这样的忠心，这样的热诚，才不是诗人杜撰得出来的哩！如此纯真的情感，只存在于那个被我们称为没教养的、粗鲁的阶级中。我们这些有教养的人，实际上是被教养成了一塌糊涂的人！毕恭毕敬地读读这个故事吧，我求你。今天我由于写下了它，心情格外平静；再说，你从我的字迹也看得出，我可不是像平时那样心慌意乱，信手涂鸦的呵。读吧，亲爱的威廉，并且在读的时候想着，这也是你的朋友的故事。可不是么，我过去的遭遇和他一样，将来也会一样；只是我不如这个穷苦的不幸者的一半勇敢，一半坚决，我几乎没有拿自己与他相比的勇气。





九月五日


她的丈夫在乡下办事，她写了一张便条给他，开头一句是：

“亲爱的，我的好人，你赶快回来吧，我怀着无比的喜悦期待着你。”

碰巧一位朋友带来消息，说他有些事务未了，不能马上回来。这样字条便一直摆到桌上，当晚落到了我的手里。我读着读着就微笑了。她问我笑什么。

“人的想象力真是神赐的礼物。”我脱口说出，“我有一会儿恍惚觉得，它就是写给我的。”

她听了不再言语，样子似乎不高兴；我也只好沉默下来。





九月六日


我好不容易才下定决心，脱掉我第一次带绿蒂跳舞时穿的那件青色燕尾服；它式样简朴，穿到最后简直看不得了。我又让裁缝完全照样做了一件，同样的领子，同样的袖头，再配上一式的黄背心和黄裤子。

可新做的总不能完全称我的心。我不知道……我想，过段时间也许会好一点吧。





九月十二日


为了接阿尔伯特，她出门去了几天，今天我一跨进她房间，她便迎面走来，我于是高高兴兴地吻了她的手。

从镜台旁飞来一只金丝雀，落在她的肩上。

“一个新朋友，”她一边说，一边把雀儿逗到她手上，“是送给小家伙们的。你瞧多可爱！你瞧！每次我喂它面包，它都扑打双翅，小喙儿啄起来可真灵巧。它还和我接吻哩，你瞧！”

她说着便把嘴唇伸给金丝雀，这鸟儿也将自己的小喙子凑到她的芳唇上，仿佛确曾感受到了自己所享受的幸福似的。

“让它也吻吻你吧。”绿蒂道，同时把金丝雀递过来。

这鸟喙儿在她的嘴唇和我的嘴唇之间起了沟通作用，和它轻轻一接触，我仿佛就吸到了她的芳泽，心中顿时充满甜美无比的预感。

“它和你接吻并非毫无贪求，”我说，“它是在寻找食粮，光亲热一下会令它失望而去的。”

“它也从我嘴里吃东西。”她说，——她真就用嘴唇衔着几片面包屑递给它；在她那嘴唇上，洋溢着最天真无邪和愉快幸福的笑意。

我转开了脸。她真不该这样做啊！不该用如此天真无邪而又令人销魂的场面，来刺激我的想象力，把我这颗有时已由对生活的淡漠摇得入睡了的心重又唤醒！——为什么不该呢？——她是如此信赖我！她知道，我是多么爱她！





九月十五日


我真给气疯了，威廉，世上还有点价值的东西本已不多，可是人们仍不懂得爱护珍惜。你知道那两株美丽的胡桃树，那两株我和绿蒂去拜访一位善良的老牧师时曾在它们底下坐过的胡桃树！一想到这两株树，上帝知道，我心中便会充满最大的快乐！它们把牧师家的院子变得多么幽静，多么阴凉呵！它们的枝干是那样挺拔！看着这两株树，自然便会怀念许多年前栽种它们的那两位可敬的牧师。乡村学校的一个教员向我们多次提到他俩中一位的名字，这名字还是他从自己祖父口里听来的。人都讲了，这位牧师是个很好的人；每当走到树下，你对他的怀念便会显得神圣起来。告诉你，威廉，当我们昨天谈到这两株树已给人砍了的时候，教员就已眼泪汪汪的。砍掉了！我气得几乎发疯，恨不得把那个砍第一斧头的狗东西给宰啦。说到我这个人，那真是只要看见自己院子里长的树中有一棵快老死了，心里也会难过得要命。可也有一件，亲爱的朋友，人们到底还是有感情的！全村老小都抱怨连天；我真希望牧师娘子能从奶油、鸡蛋以及其他东西上感觉出，她给村子造成了多大的伤害。因为这个新牧师的老婆（我们的老牧师已经去世），一个瘦削而多病的女人，她有一切理由不喜欢这个世界，世人中也没有一个喜欢她；而她正是砍树的罪魁。这个自命博学的蠢女人，她还混在研究《圣经》的行列里，起劲地要对基督教进行一次新式的、合乎道德的改革，对拉瓦特尔的狂热不以为然；她的健康状况糟透了，因此在人世上全无欢乐可言。也只有这样一个家伙，才可能干出砍树的勾当来。你瞧我这气真是平不了啦！试想一想，就因为什么树叶掉下来会弄脏弄臭她的院子，树顶会挡住她的阳光，还有胡桃熟了孩子们会扔石头去打等等，据说这些都有害于她的神经，妨碍她专心思考，妨碍她在肯尼柯特[1]、塞姆勒[2]和米夏厄里斯[3]之间进行比较权衡。我看见村民们特别是老人如此不满，便问：“你们当时怎么竟听任人家砍了呢？”

他们回答：“在我们这地方，只要村长想干什么，你就毫无办法。”

可有一点倒也公平：牧师从自己老婆的怪癖中从未得到过甜头，这次竟想捞点好处，打算与村长平分卖树的钱；谁知镇公所知道了说，请把树送到这儿来吧！因为镇公所对长着这两棵树的牧师宅院从来拥有产权，便将它们卖给了出价最高的人。树反正砍倒啦！呵，可惜我不是侯爵！否则我真想把牧师娘子、村长和镇公所统统给……侯爵！……可我要真是侯爵，哪儿还会关心自己领地内的那些树啊？





十月十日


每当我看见她那双黑眼睛，我心中便十分快乐！使我感到不安的是，阿尔伯特似乎并不那么幸福，不像他希望……不如我自以为会……要是我……

我本不爱用删节号，但在这儿没有其他办法表达自己的意思；即使如此，我想也说得够清楚了。





十月十二日


莪相已从我心中把荷马排挤出去。这位杰出的诗人领我走进了一个何等样的世界呵！我漂泊在荒野里，四周狂风呼啸，只见在朦胧的月光下，狂风吹开弥漫的浓雾，现出了先人的幽灵。我听见从山上送来的林涛声中，夹杂着洞穴里幽灵们的咽咽哭声，以及在她的爱人——那高贵的战死者长满青苔的坟茔上哭得死去活来的少女的泣诉。蓦然间，我瞅见了他，瞅见了在荒野里寻觅自己祖先的足迹的白发行吟诗人；可他找到的，唉，却只是他们的墓碑。随后，他叹息着仰望夜空中灿烂的金星，发现它正要沉入波涛汹涌的大海，而往昔的时光便活现在他英雄的心中；要知道这和蔼的星光也曾照临过勇士们的险途，这明月也曾辉耀过他们凯旋归来时扎着花环的战船啊。在白发诗人的额间，我发现了深深的苦闷；我看见这最后一位孤独的伟人，他正精疲力竭地向着自己的坟墓蹒跚行去，一边不断地从已故亲人的虚幻无力的存在中吸取令人感到灼痛的欢乐，俯视着冰冷的土地和在狂风中摇曳不定的深草，一边口里呼道：“有个漂泊者将会到来，他曾见过我的美好青春；他将会问：‘那位歌手在哪里？芬戈[4]杰出的儿子在哪里？’他的脚步将踏过我的坟头，他将在大地上四处将我寻索，但却找不着我。”

啊，朋友！我真愿像一位忠诚的卫士拔出剑来，一下子结果我这位君王的性命，以免除他慢慢死去的痉挛的痛苦，然后再让我的灵魂去追随这位获得解放的半神。





十月十九日


多么空虚啊！我的胸口里觉得可怕的空虚！——我常常想，哪怕你能把她拥抱在心口一次，仅仅一次，这整个的空虚就会填满了。





十月二十六日


是的，好朋友，我将会确信，越来越确信，一个人的生命的价值是很少的，非常非常少！一个女朋友来看绿蒂，我便退到隔壁房间，拿起一本书来读，却读不进去，随后又取过一支笔想写点什么。这当儿，我听见她们在低声交谈，相互报告一些不足道的事，无外乎谁谁结了婚，谁谁生了病、病得很重之类的本地要闻。

“她现在老是干咳，脸上颧骨这么高，还常常晕倒，我看是活不长喽。”客人说。

“那个N.N的情况也一样糟。”绿蒂应着。

“他已经浮肿了。”客人又讲。

听她俩这么聊着，我在想象中已去到那两个可怜人的病榻前，看见他们如何苦苦挣扎，留恋生命，如何……

可是，威廉呵，我这两位女士却满不在乎地谈着他们，就像谈一个素不相识者快死了似的！我环顾四周，打量着我所在的房间，打量着放在这儿那儿的绿蒂的衣物，阿尔伯特的文书，以及这些我现在已经十分熟悉的家具，乃至这个墨水池，心里不禁就想：“瞧，你现在对这个家庭有多么重要啊！太太重要了！你的朋友们敬重你。你常常带给他们快乐；而你的心里也觉得，似乎离了他们你就活不下去。可是——你要是这会儿走了，从他们的圈子里消失了，他们又将有多久会感到失去你给他们的生活造成了缺陷呢？多久？唉，人生才叫无常呵！他甚至在对自己的存在最有把握的地方，在留下了他存在的唯一真实印记的地方，在他的亲爱者的记忆中，在他们的心坎里，也注定了要熄灭，要消失，而且如此的快！





十月二十七日


人对人竟如此地缺少价值，一想起来我常常恨不得撕破自己的胸膛，砸碎自己的脑袋。唉，要是我不带来爱情、欢乐、温暖和幸福，人家就不会白白给我；另一方面，就算我心里充满了幸福，也不能使一个冷冰冰地、有气无力地站在我面前的人幸福啊。





同日晚


我具有再多精力，也会被对她的热情吞噬掉；我具有再多天赋，没有她一切都将化作乌有。





十月三十日


我已有上百次几乎就要拥抱她了！伟大的主知道，当一个人面前摆着那么可爱的东西而又不能伸出手去攫取时，他心头会多难受。攫取本是人类最自然的欲望。婴儿不总是伸出小手抓他们喜爱的一切么？——可我呢？





十一月三日


上帝知道，我在上床时常常怀着这样一种希冀，是的，有时甚至是渴望，不要再醒来了吧！因此，第二天，当我早上睁开眼睛又见到太阳时，心里便异常难受。唉，要是我在心绪不佳时能怪天气，怪第三者，怪一件没做成功的事情，那也倒好，我身上的难受劲儿定会减少一半。多可悲啊，我的感觉千真万确，一切的过错全在我自己！——不，不是过错。总之，正如一度一切幸福的根源全存在于我本身，现在一切痛苦的根源也在我自己身上。当初，我满心欢喜地到处游逛，走到哪儿，哪儿就变成了天国，心胸开阔得可以容下整个宇宙，难道这个我不是同一个人么？可如今，…这颗心已经死去，从中再也涌流不出欣喜之情；我的眼睛枯涩了，再也不能以莹洁的泪水滋润我的感官；我的额头更是可怕地皱了起来。我痛苦之极；我已失去自己生命中唯一的欢乐，唯一神圣的、令我振奋的力量，我用它来创造自己周围的世界的力量，这力量业已消逝！

我眺望窗外远处的山岗，只见日光刺破岗上的浓雾，洒布在下面静静的草地上；在已经落叶的柳丝间，一条蜿蜒曲折的小河缓缓向我流来……呵，要是这如此美好的景色已像一幅漆画似的在我眼前凝滞不动，不能再娱悦我心，使它产生出丝毫的幸福感觉，那我这整个人在上帝面前不就成了一口干涸的水井，一只破底儿的水桶么。我常常扑倒在地，祈求上苍赐给我眼泪，就像一个头顶上是铁青色的天，四周是干裂的土地的农夫在祈雨一样。

但是，唉，我感觉到，上帝绝不会因为我们拼命哀求就赐给我们雨水和阳光！可那些我一回首就心里难过的过去的时光，它们为何又如此幸福呢？是因为那时我十分耐心地期待着他的精神来感召我，满怀感激地、专心一意地接受着他倾注到我身上的欢愉。





十一月八日


她责备我不知节制！啊，态度是如此温柔，亲切！说我不该每次一端起酒杯来就非喝一瓶不可。

“别这样，”她说，“想想你的绿蒂吧！”

“想！”我反驳道，“还用得着你叫我想吗？我在想啊！——不只是在想！你时刻都在我的心中。今天，我就坐在你不久前从马车上下来的那个地方……”

她引开话题，不让我讲下去。好朋友，我算完了！她想怎样处置我，就可以怎样处置。





十一月十五日


我感谢你，威廉，感谢你对我真诚的同情，感谢你的忠告；我请你放心，让我忍受下去吧，我尽管疲惫不堪，仍然有足够的力量支撑到底。我尊重宗教信仰，这你知道；我觉得，它是某些虚弱者的拐杖，奄奄一息的振奋剂。不过，它难道能够对人人都起这个作用么？必须对人人都起这个作用么？要是你看一看这个广大的世界，你就会发现有成千上万的人，对于他们来说宗教信仰并非如此，而且将来也不会如此，无论是旧教还是新教。难道我就非有宗教帮助不可么？圣子耶稣自己不是说过，只有那些天父交给他的人，才能生活在他周围么？要是天父没有把我交给他怎么办？要是如我的心所告诉我，天父希望把我留给自己怎么办？——我请你别误解我，别把这些诚心诚意的话看成是讽刺。我是在对你披肝沥胆，否则我就宁可沉默；因为，对于这一切大家和我一样都不甚了然的事情，我是很不乐意开口的。人不是命中注定要受完他那份罪，喝完他那杯苦酒吗？既然天堂里的上帝呷一口都觉得这酒太苦，我为什么就得充好汉，硬装作喝起来甜呢？此刻，我的整个生命都战栗于存在与虚无之间，过去像闪电似的照亮了未来的黯间深渊，我周围的一切都在沉沦，世界也将随我走向毁灭；在这样可怕的时刻，我还有什么可害羞的呢？那个被人压迫、孤立无助、注定沦亡的可怜虫，他在最后一刻不也鼓足力气从内心深处发出呼喊：“上帝啊，上帝！你干吗抛弃我？”[5]那么，我为何就该羞于流露自己的情感，就该害怕这位把天空像手帕一样卷起的神之子尚且不免的一刻呢？





十一月二十一日


她看不出，她感觉不到，她正在酿造一种将把我和她自己都毁掉的毒酒；而我呢，也满怀欣喜地接过她递过来置我于死地的酒杯，一饮而尽。为什么她要常常——常常吗？不，也不常常，而是有时候——为什么有时候她要那么温柔地望着我，要欣然接受我下意识的情感流露，要在额头上表现出对我的痛苦的同情呢？

昨天，当我离开时，她握着我的手说：“再见，亲爱的维特！”

亲爱的维特！这是破天荒第一次她叫我做亲爱的，叫得我周身筋骨都酥软了。我把这句话重复了无数次，等到夜里要上床睡觉时，还自言自语叨咕了半天，最后竟冒出一句：“晚安，亲爱的维特！”说罢自己禁不住笑起自己来。





十一月二十二日


我不能向上帝祈祷：“让她成为我的吧！”尽管如此，我却常常觉得她就是我的。我不能祈祷：“把她给我吧！”因为她属于另外一个人。我常常拿理智来克制自己的痛苦；可是，一当我松懈下来，我就会没完没了地反驳自己的理智。





十一月二十四日


她感觉到了我是多么痛苦。今天她对我的一瞥，深深地打动了我的心。当时我发现只有她一个人在；我沉默无语，她也久久地望着我。如今，我在她身上已见不到动人的妩媚，见不到智慧的光辉；这一切在我眼前业已消失。她现在打动我的，是一种美好得多的目光，是一种饱含着无比亲切的同情、无比甜蜜的怜悯的目光。为什么我不可以跪倒在她脚下呢？为什么我不可以搂住她的脖子，以无数的亲吻来报答她呢？为了避开我的盯视，她坐到钢琴前，伴着琴声，用她那甜美、低婉的歌喉，轻轻唱起了一支和谐的歌。我从来还未看见她的嘴唇像这样迷人过；它们微微翕动着，恰似正在吸吮那清泉般从钢琴中涌流出来的一串串妙音；同时，从她的玉口内，也发现神奇的回响。——是的，要是我能用言语向你说清这情景就好了！我再也忍不住，便弯下腰去发誓说：可爱的嘴唇啊，我永远也不会冒昧地亲吻你们，因为你们是天界神灵浮泛的所在啊！——然而……我希望……哈，你瞧，这就像立在我灵魂前面的一道高墙……为了幸福我得翻过墙去……然后下地狱补赎罪过！——罪过？





十一月二十六日


我有时对自己讲：“你的命运反正就这样了；祝祷别人都幸福吧——还从来没谁像你这样受过苦哟。”随后，我便读一位古代诗人[6]的作品，读着读着，仿佛窥见了自己的心。我要受的罪真是太多了！唉，难道在我以前的人们都这样不幸过么？





十一月三十日


不，不，我注定振作不起来了！无论我走到哪里，都会碰见叫我心神不定的事情。比如今天吧！呵，命运！呵，人类！

正午时分，我沿着河边散步，没有心思回去吃饭。四野一片荒凉，山前刮来阵阵湿冷的西风，灰色的雨云已经窜进峡谷里边。远远地，我瞅见一个穿着件破旧的绿色外套的人，在岩石间爬来爬去，像是正在采摘野花似的。我走到近旁，他听见脚步声便转过头来，模样十分怪异。脸上最主要的神情是难言的悲哀，但也透露着诚实与善良。黑色的头发用簪子在脑顶别成了两个卷儿，其余部分则编成一条大辫子拖在背后，看衣着是个地位低微的人。我想，他对我去过问他的事是不会见怪的，因此便与他搭起话来，问他找什么。

“找花呗，”他深深地叹了一口气，回答道，“可一朵也找不着。”

“眼下可不是找得到花的季节啊。”我说着微笑了。

“花倒是多得很。”他边讲边向我走下来，“在我家的园子里，长着玫瑰和两种忍冬花，其中一种是我爹送我的，长起来就跟野草一般快；我已经找了它两天，就是找不着。这外边也总开着花，黄的，蓝的，红的，还有那矢车菊的小花儿才叫美呢。不知怎的我竟一朵也找不到……”

我感到有些蹊跷，便绕个弯儿问：“你要这些花干吗呢？”

他脸上一抽动，闪过一丝古怪的笑意。

“您可别讲出去啊，”说时他把食指搁在嘴唇上，“我答应了送给我那心上人儿一束花。”

“这很好嘛。”我说。

“嗬，”他道，“她有好多好多别的东西，可富着哪。”

“尽管这样，她还是一定喜欢您这束花。”我应着。

“嗬，”他接着讲，“她有许多宝石，还有一顶王冠。”

“她叫什么来着？”

“唉，要是联省共和国[7]雇了我，我就会是另一个人啦！”他说，“可不，有一阵子，我过得挺不错。现在不成了，现在我……”

他眼泪汪汪地抬起头来望着苍空，其他一切全明白了。

“这么说，您也曾经幸福过？”我问。

“唉，要能再像那时候一样就好喽！”他回答，“那时候，我舒服，愉快，自由自在，就跟水中的鱼儿似的！”

“亨利希！”这当儿一个老妇人喊着，循着大路走来，“亨利希，你在哪儿？我们到处找你，快回家吃饭吧！”

“他是您的儿子吗？”我走过去，问。

“可不，我的可怜的儿子！”她回答，“上帝罚我背了一个沉重的十字架啊。”

“他这样多久了？”我问。

“像这样安静才半年，”她说，“就这样还得感谢上帝。从前他一年到头都大吵大闹的，只好用链子锁在疯人院里。现在不招惹任何人了，只是还经常跟国王和皇帝们打交道。从前，他可是个又善良又沉静的人，能供养我，写得一手好字；后来突然沉思默想起来，接着又发高烧，高烧过后便疯了；现在便是您看见的这个样子。要是我把他的事讲给您听，先生……”

我打断她滔滔不绝的话，问：

“他说他曾经有一段时间很自在，很幸福，这指的是怎么一个时候呢？”

“这傻小子！”她怜悯地笑了笑，大声说，“他指的是他神志昏乱的那段时间，他常常夸耀它。当时，他关在疯人院里，精神完全失常了。”

这话于我犹如一声霹雳，我塞了一枚银币在老妇人手里，仓皇逃离了她的身边。

“你那时是幸福的呵！”我情不自禁地喊着，快步奔回城去，“那时候，你自在得如水中的游鱼！——天堂里的上帝，难道你注定人的命运就是如此：他只有在具有理智以前，或者重新丧失理智以后，才能是幸福的么？——可怜的人！但我又是多么羡慕你的精神失常，知觉紊乱呵！你满怀着希望到野外来，为你的女王采摘鲜花，在冬天里！你为采不到鲜花而难过，不理解为什么竟采不到。而我呢，从家里跑出来时既无目的，也无希望，眼下回家去时依然如此。你幻想着，要是联省共和国雇用你，你就将成为一个了不起的人。幸福啊，谁要能把自身的不幸归因于人世的障碍！你感觉不出，感觉不出，你的不幸原本存在于你破碎的心中，存在于你被搅乱了的头脑里；而这样的不幸，全世界所有的国王也帮你消除不了啊。”

谁要嘲笑一个病人到远方的圣水泉去求医，结果反倒加重自己的病痛，使余生变得更难忍受，谁就不得善终！谁要蔑视一个为摆脱良心的不安和灵魂的痛苦而去朝拜圣墓的人，谁同样不得善终！要知道这个朝圣者，他的脚掌在荆棘丛生的道路上踏下的每一步，对他充满恐惧的灵魂来说，都是一滴镇痛剂；他每坚持着朝前走一天，晚上躺下时心里都要轻松得多。——难道你们能把这称作是妄想么，你们这些舒舒服服坐在软垫子上的清谈家？——妄想！上帝呵，你看见我的眼泪了吧！你把人已经造的够可怜了，难道还一定得再给他一些兄弟，让他们来把他仅有的一点点东西，仅有的一点点对于你这博爱者的信任，也统统夺走么？要知道对于能治百病的仙草的信任，对于葡萄的眼泪[8]的信任，也就是对于你的信任，相信你能赋予我们周围的一切以治疗疾病和减轻痛苦的力量，而我无时无刻不需要这种力量。我所没有见过面的父亲呵，曾几何时，你使我的心灵那么充实，如今却又转过脸去不再理我！父亲呵，把我召唤到你身边去吧，别再沉默无语；你的沉默使我这颗焦渴的心再也受不了啦！难道一个人，一个父亲，在自己的儿子突然归来，搂住他的脖子喊叫“我回来了，父亲”的时候，他还能生气么？别生气，如果我中断了人生旅程，没有如你所希望的那样苦挨下去。举世无处不一个样：劳劳碌碌，辛辛苦苦，而后才是报酬和欢乐；可这于我有何意义？我只有在你所在之处才会得到安适，我愿意到你的面前来吃苦和享乐。——而你，仁慈的天父。难道会拒我于门外么？





十二月一日


威廉！我上次信中讲的那个人，那个幸福的不幸者，过去就是绿蒂的父亲的秘书。他对她起了恋慕之心，先是暗暗滋长着，隐藏着，后来终于表露出来，因此丢掉了差事，结果发了疯。这段话尽管是干巴巴的，但请你体会一下，这个故事是如何震动了我。我之所以写成像你读到的这个样子，因为阿尔伯特就是这样无动于衷地给我讲的。





十二月四日


我求求你……你听我说吧，我这个人完了，再也忍受不住了！今天我坐在她房里……我坐着，她弹着琴，弹了各式各样的曲子，可支支曲子全都触动了我的心事！全都！全都！……你看怎么办？……她的小妹妹在我怀里打扮布娃娃。热泪涌进我的眼眶。我低下头，目光落在她的结婚戒指上……我的泪水滚落下来……这当儿，她突然弹起那支熟悉而美妙的曲调，我的灵魂顿时感到极大的安慰，往事立刻一件件浮上心头，我回忆起了初次听见这支曲调的美好日子，想到了后来的暗淡时日，想起了最终的不快和失望，以及……我在房里来回急走。心儿紧迫得几至于窒息。

“看在上帝分上，”我嚷道，情绪激动地冲她跑去，“看在上帝分上，别弹啦！”

她停下来，怔怔地望着我！

“维特，”她笑吟吟地说，这笑一直刺进了我心里，“维特，你病得很厉害啊，连自己最喜爱的东西也讨厌起来了。回去吧，我求你安静安静！”

我一下从她身边跑开，并且……上帝呵，你看见了我的痛苦，请你快快结束它吧。





十二月六日


她的形象四处追逐着我！不论我醒着还是做梦，都充满我整个的心灵！现在，当我闭上眼睛，在这儿，在聚集着我的内视力的额头中，便显现出她那双黑色的眼眸来。就在这儿啊！我无法向你表达清楚。每当我一阖上眼，它们就出现在这里，在我面前，在我心中，静静地如一片海洋，一道深谷，填满了我额头里的所有感官。

人，这个受到赞美的半神，他究竟算什么！他不是在正好需要力量的当儿，却缺少力量么？当他在多些欢乐中向上飞升，或在痛苦中向下沉沦时，他都渴望自己能融进无穷的宇宙中去，可偏偏在这一刹那，他不是又会受到羁縻，重行恢复迟钝的、冰冷的意识么？

编者致读者


从我们的朋友值得注意的最后几天中，我本来非常希望有足够多的第一手资料留下来，这样，我就没必要在他遗留下来的书信中间，再插进自己的叙述了。

我竭尽全力从了解他经历的人们口中搜集确切的事实；他的故事很简单，人们讲的全都大同小异，不一样的只是对当事者们思想性格的说法和评议。

剩下来由我们做的，只是把经过反复努力才打听到的情况认真叙述出来，把死者留下的几封信插入其中，对找到的哪怕一张小纸片也不轻易放过；要知道事情是出在一些异乎寻常的人们中间，所以即使某个单独的行为的真正动机，要想揭示出来也极不容易。

愤懑与忧郁在维特心中越来越深地扎下了根，两者紧紧缠绕在一起，久而久之就控制了他的整个存在。他精神的和谐完全被摧毁了，内心烦躁得如烈火焚烧，把他各种天赋的力量统统搅乱，最后落得个心力交瘁。为了摆脱这苦境，他拼命挣扎，作出了比过去和种种灾祸作斗争时更大的努力。内心的忧惧消耗了余下的精神力量，他不再生气勃勃，聪敏机灵，变成了一个愁眉苦脸的客人，因此越发不幸，越不幸又变得越发任性起来。至少阿尔伯特的朋友们是这样讲的；他们认为，维特像个一天就要把全部财产花光、晚上只好吃苦挨饿的人，他对终于获得渴望已久的幸福的那个真诚稳重的丈夫，以及他力图在将来仍保持这个幸福的行为，都不能作出正确评价。他们说，阿尔伯特在这么短的一段时间里没有变，他仍然是维特一开始所认识、器重和尊敬的那样一个人。他爱绿蒂超过一切，他为她感到骄傲，希望别人承认她是最最可爱的女性。他不希望自己和她之间出现任何猜疑的阴影，他不乐意和任何人哪怕以最无邪的方式，仅仅在一瞬间共同占有这个宝贝，难道因此就能责怪他不成？他们承认，当有维特在他妻子房中的时候，阿尔伯特常常就走开了；但他这样做不是出于对朋友的敌视和反感，而只是因为他感觉到，他在跟前维特总是显得局促不安。

绿蒂的父亲染了病，只能躺在家里；他给她派来一辆马车，她便坐着出城去了。那是个美丽的冬日，刚下过一场大雪，田野全给盖上了白被。

维特次日一早就跟了去，以便在阿尔伯特不去接绿蒂的情况下，自己陪她回来。

晴朗的天气也很少改变他阴郁的情绪，他的心总感觉压抑难受，老有些可悲的景象萦绕在眼前，脑子里不断涌现出一个接一个的痛苦念头。

正如他始终对自己不满一样，别人的情况在他看来也就更加可虑，更加暧昧了。他确信，阿尔伯特夫妇之间的和谐关系已遭破坏，为此他不但自责，还暗暗地埋怨身为丈夫的阿尔伯特。

途中，他的思绪又回到了这个问题上。

“是啊，是啊，”他自言自语说，暗暗还在咬牙切齿，“这就叫亲切的、和蔼的、温柔的、富于同情心的态度！这就叫默默无言的、持久不变的忠诚！不，这是厌倦与冷漠！不是任何一件无聊的琐事，都比他忠实可爱的妻子更吸引他么？他知道珍惜自己的幸福吗？他知道给予她应得的尊重吗？可是，她好歹已是他的人，她好歹……我知道这个，我还知道别的事情；我已经惯于这样想，他将使我发疯，他还要结果了我。——他对我的友谊经得起考验吗？他不是已将我对绿蒂的眷恋视为对自己权利的侵犯么？将我对绿蒂的关心，视为对他的无声谴责么？我清楚知道，我感觉得出来，他不乐意看见我，他希望我走，我在这儿已成了他的累赘。”

维特一次次放慢脚步，一次次停下来，站着发呆，看样子已打算往回走了。然而，他终究还是继续往前走去，边走边思索，边走边唠叨，最后像是很不情愿地走到了猎庄门前。

他跨进大门，打听老人和绿蒂在哪里，发现屋子里的人都有些激动。最大的一个男孩告诉他，瓦尔海姆那边出了事，一个农民给人打死了！——这个新闻没有给维特留下多少印象。他走进里屋，发现绿蒂正在极力劝自己的父亲，叫老人不要拖着有病的身子去现场调查那件惨案。凶手是谁尚不得而知。有人早上在门口发现了受害者的尸体，估计就是那位寡妇后来的长工；她先前雇的那个是在心怀不满的情况下离开的。

维特一听马上跳了起来。

“完全可能！”他叫道，“我得去看看，一秒钟也不能等。”

他匆匆忙忙向瓦尔海姆奔去；途中，一桩桩往事又历历在目。他一刻也不怀疑，肇事者就是那个多次与他交谈、后来简直成了他知己的年轻人。

要走到停放尸体的那家小酒馆去，他必须从那几株菩提树下经过。一见这个曾经极为可爱的所在如今已面目全非，他心中不由一震。邻家的孩子们常常坐在上面游戏的那道门槛，眼下是一片血污。爱情与忠诚这些人类最美好的情操，已经蜕变成了暴力和仇杀。高大的菩提树没有叶，覆着霜；以前在公墓的矮墙上形成一片穹顶的美丽树篱如今光秃秃的，盖着雪的墓碑便从空隙中突露出来。

正当他走拢全村人都聚在跟前的小酒店的时候，突然腾起一阵喧闹。人们看见远远走来一队武装汉子，便异口同声喊着：“抓到啦！抓到啦！”——维特也朝那边望去，顿时便看得一清二楚：是他！是这个爱那位寡妇爱得发狂的青年长工；前不久，他带着一肚子气恼，垂头丧气地四处徘徊，维特还碰见过他。

“瞧你干的好事，不幸的人呵！”维特嚷叫着，向被捕者奔去。

这人呆呆地瞪着他，先不言语，临了却泰然自若地答道：“谁也别想娶她，她也别打算嫁给任何人。”

犯人被押进了酒店，维特仓皇离去。

这个可怕的、残酷的经历，猛地震动了他，使他的心完全乱了。霎时间，他像让人从自己悲哀、抑郁和冷漠的沉思中拖了出来，突然为一种不可抗拒的同情心所控制，因而产生了无论如何要挽救那个人的强烈欲望。他觉得他太不幸了，相信他即使成为罪人也仍然是无辜的。他把自己完全摆在他的地位上，确信能说服其他人同样相信他的无辜。他恨不能立刻为他辩护；他的脑子里已经装满有力的证词；他急匆匆向猎庄赶去，半道上就忍不住把准备向总管陈述的话低声讲了出来。

他一踏进房间，发现阿尔伯特也在场，情绪顿时就低落下来；但是他仍然打起精神，把自己的看法向总管讲了一遍，讲的时候情绪十分激昂。可总管却连连摇头；虽然维特把一个人替另一个人辩护所可能讲的全讲了，而且讲得如此情词恳切，娓娓动听，但结果显而易见，总管仍然无动于衷。他甚至不容我们的朋友把话讲完，就给以激烈的驳斥，责怪他不该袒护一个杀人犯！总管教训他说，依了他一切法律都得取消，国家的安全就得彻底完蛋。最后，总管还补充：在这样的事情上，自己除去负起最崇高的职责，一切按部就班、照章行事以外，便什么都不能干。

维特还是不甘心，不过只是再恳求老人说，希望他在有人出来帮助罪犯逃跑的情况下，能够睁一只眼闭一只眼！这个请求也遭到总管拒绝。这当儿，阿尔伯特终于插话了，他也站在老头子一边，叫维特再也开不得口。维特怀着难以忍受的痛苦走出房去；在此之前，总管一再告诉他：“不，他没有救了！”

这句话给了他多么沉重的打击，我们可以从一张显然是他当天写的字条看出来。我们在他的文书中找到了这张字条，上面写道：

你没有救了，不幸的朋友！我明白，咱们都没有救了！

至于阿尔伯特最后当着总管讲的关于罪犯的一席话，维特听了更是反感之极，甚至还以为发现了有几处影射自己的地方。因此，尽管他以自己的聪明，经过反复考虑，不至于看不出这两位的话可能有道理，他却不愿意承认这一点，似乎对他来说，一承认就意味着背弃自己的本性。

从他的文书中，我们还发现另一张字条，与这个问题有着关系，也许它能把维特对阿尔伯特的态度充分泄露给我们吧：

有什么用呢，尽管我反反复复地告诉自己，对自己讲：他是个好人，正派人！可是，我心乱如麻，叫我怎么公正得了呵。

在一个温暖的傍晚，雪已经开始消融，绿蒂随阿尔伯特步行回城去。途中，她东瞅瞅，西望望，像是少了维特的陪伴，心神不定似的。阿尔伯特开始谈他，在指责他的同时，仍不忘替他讲几句公道话。他谈到他那不幸的热情，希望能够想办法让他离开。

“为了我们自己，我也希望这样。”他说，“另外，我请求你，”他接着讲，“想法使他对你的态度改变一下，别让他这么老来看你。人家会注意的；再说据我了解，这儿那儿已有人在讲闲话啦。”

绿蒂默不作声；阿尔伯特似乎品出了她这沉默的味道，至少从此再没对她提到过维特，甚至当她自己再提到维特时，他也立刻中止谈话，要不就把话题引到一边去。

维特为救那个不幸者所作的无望的努力，是一股行将熄灭的火苗儿的最后一次闪动；自此，他便更深地沉浸在痛苦与无为中。特别是当他听说，法庭也许会传他去当证人，证明那个如今矢口否认自己罪行的青年确实有罪的时候，他更是气得快要疯了。

他在实际生活中遭遇的种种不快，在公使馆里的难堪，以及一切的失败，一切的屈辱，这时都统统在他心里上上下下翻腾开来。这一切的一切，都使他觉得自己的无所作为就是应该。他发现自己毫无出路，连赖以平平庸庸地生活下去的本领也没有。结果，他便一任自己古怪的感情、思想以及无休止的渴慕驱使，一个劲儿和那位温柔可爱的女子相周旋，毫无目的、毫无希望地耗费着自己的精力，既破坏了人家的安宁，又苦了自己，一天一天向着可悲的结局靠近。

下边我编进他遗留下来的几封信。他的迷惘，他的热情，他的无休止的向往与追求，以及他对人生的厌倦，统统将从这几封信得到有力的证明。





十二月十二日


亲爱的威廉，目前我处于一种坐卧不安的状态，就像人们说的那些被恶鬼驱赶着四处游荡的不幸者一样。有时，我心神不定；这既非恐惧，也非渴望，而是一种内心的莫名的狂躁，几乎像要撕裂我的胸脯，扼紧我的喉咙！难过哟，难过哟！于是，我只好奔出门来，在这严冬季节的可怕的夜里瞎跑一气。

昨天晚上，我又不得不出去。其时适逢突然到来的融雪天气，我听见河水在泛滥，一道道小溪在激涨，雪水从瓦尔海姆方向流来，窜进了我那可爱的峡谷里。夜里十一时我跑出家门。只见狂暴的山洪卷起旋涡，从悬崖顶上直冲下来，漫过田畴、草场、园篱和野地里的一切，把开阔的谷地变成了一片翻腾的海洋，狂风同时发出呼啸，那景象怕人极了！尤其是当月亮重新露出脸来，静静地枕在乌云上，我面前的激流在它可怖而迷人的清辉映照下，翻滚着，咆哮着，我更是不寒而栗，心中冷不防产生一个欲望！我面对深渊，张开双臂，心里想着：跳下去吧！跳下去吧！要是我能带着自己的不幸和痛苦，像奔腾的山洪似的冲下悬崖峭壁，这将是何等痛快哟！唉，我却抬不起腿来，没有把所有的苦难一举结束的勇气！——我的时辰还没有到，我觉着。威廉啊，我真恨不得跟狂风一块儿去驱散乌云，去遏止激流，哪怕为此得付出我的生命！唉，也许连这样的欢乐也不容一个遭受囚禁的人得到吧？

俯瞰着那株我俩曾在下边坐过的老柳树，我心里非常难过——草坪也被水淹了，老柳树也几乎认不出来了，威廉！“还有她家的那些草地，还有她家周围的整个地区！”我想，“我们的小亭子这会儿准让激流毁得面目全非了吧！”想到此，一线往昔的阳光射进了我的心田，宛如一个囚人梦见了羊群，梦见了草地，梦见了荣耀的升迁一般！——我挺立着，不再骂自己没有死的勇气。我本该……

唉，我现在又坐在这儿，恰似个从篱笆上拾取烂柴和沿门告化的穷老婆子，苟延残喘，得过且过，毫无乐趣。





十二月十四日


怎么回事，好朋友？我竟自己害怕起自己来了！难道我对她的爱，不是最神圣、最纯洁、最真挚的爱么？难道什么时候我心中怀有过该受惩罚的欲念么？——我不想起誓……可现在这些梦！呵，那班相信鬼神能跟我们捣乱的人，他们是太正确了！这一夜——讲起来我的嘴唇还在哆嗦——这一夜我把她搂在怀里，紧紧贴在自己心口，用千百次的亲吻堵住她那说着绵绵情话的嘴；我的目光完全沉溺在她那醉意朦胧的媚眼中！主啊，我在回忆这令人销魂的梦境时，心中仍感到幸福，这难道也该受罚么？绿蒂呵，绿蒂呵！——我已经完了！我神志昏乱，八天来一直糊里糊涂，眼睛里满是泪水。我到哪儿都不自在，又到哪儿都感到自在。我无所希望，无所欲求。看起来，我真该走了。

这期间，在上述的情况下，辞世的决心在维特的脑子里越来越坚定。自从回到绿蒂身边，他就一直把这看作最后的出路和希望；不过他对自己讲，不应操之过急，不应草率行事，必须怀着美好的信念，怀着尽可能宁静的决心，去走这一步。

下面这张在他的文稿中发现的纸条，看来是一封准备写给威廉的信，刚开了头，还不曾落日期。从这则残简中，可以窥见他的动摇和矛盾心情：

她的存在，她的命运以及她对我的命运的关切，从我业已干枯的眼里挤压出了最后的几滴泪水。

揭开帷幕，走到幕后去吧！一了百了，干吗还迟疑畏缩啊！因为不知道幕后是个什么情形么？因为这一去便回不来了么？也许还因为我们的灵智能预感到，那后边只有我们一无所知的黑暗和混沌吧。

维特终于和这个阴郁的念头一天天亲密起来，决心便更坚定、更不可改变了。下面这封他写给自己友人的意义双关的信，提供了一个证明。





十二月二十日


我感谢你的友情，威廉，感谢你对那句话作了这样的理解。是的，你说得对：我真该走了。只是你让我回到你们那儿来的建议，不完全合我的心意；无论如何我还想兜个圈子，尤其是天气还有希望冷一段时间，眼看路又会变得好走起来。你来接我我当然很感激；只是请你再推迟两个礼拜，等接到我的下一封信再说吧。千万别果子没熟就摘呵。而两个礼拜左右可以干很多事情。请告诉我母亲，希望她替自己的儿子祈祷；为了我带给她的所有不快，我求她原谅。我命中注定了，要使那些我本该使他们快乐的人难过。别了，我的好朋友！愿老天多多降福于你！别了！

这期间绿蒂的心绪如何，她对自己丈夫的感情怎样，对她不幸的朋友的感情怎样，我们都不便下断语；尽管凭着对她个性的了解，我们很可以在私下作出评判，尤其是一颗美丽的女性的心，更可以设身处地，体会出她的感情。

肯定的只是，她已下了决心，要想一切办法打发维特离开。如果说她还有所迟疑的话，那也是出于对朋友的一片好意和爱护；她了解，这将使维特多么难受，是的，在他几乎就不可能。然而在此期间，情况更加逼迫她认真采取行动；她的丈夫压根儿不肯再提这事，就像她也一直保持着沉默一样，而唯其如此，她便更有必要通过行动向他证明，她并未辜负他的感情。

上面引的那封维特致友人的信，写于圣诞节前的礼拜日。当晚，他去找绿蒂，碰巧只有她一个人在房中。绿蒂正忙着整理准备在圣诞节分送给小弟妹们的玩具。维特说小家伙们在收到以后一定会高兴得什么似的，并回忆了自己突然站在房门口，看见一棵挂满蜡烛、糖果和苹果的漂亮圣诞树时的惊喜心情。

“你也会得到礼物的，”绿蒂说，同时嫣然一笑，借以掩饰自己的困窘，“你也会得到礼物，条件是你要很听话；比如得到一支圣诞树上的蜡烛什么的。”

“你说的听话是什么意思？”维特嚷起来，“你要我怎么样？我能够怎么样？亲爱的绿蒂！”

“礼拜四晚上是圣诞夜，”她说，“到时候我的弟弟妹妹，我的父亲都要来这里，每人都会得到自己的礼品。你也来吧，可是在这之前别再来了。”

维特听了一怔。

“我求你。”她又说，“事已至此，我求你为了我的安宁，答应我吧；不能，再不能这样下去了啊。”

维特转过脸去不看她，自顾自地在房里来回疾走，透过牙齿缝喃喃道：“再不能这样下去了！再不能这样下去了！”

绿蒂感到自己的话把他推进了一个可怕的境界，便提出各式各样的问题来企图引开他的思路，但是不成功。

“不，绿蒂，”他嚷道，“我将再也不来见你了！”

“干吗呢？”她问，“维特，你可以来看我们，你必须来看我们，只是减少一些就行了。唉，你干吗非得生成这么个急性子，一喜欢什么就死心眼儿地迷下去！我求你，”她拉住维特的手继续说，“克制克制自己吧！你的天资，你的学识，你的才能，它们不是可以带给你各种各样的快乐么？拿出男子汉的气概来！别再苦苦恋着一个除去同情你就什么也不能帮的女孩子。”

维特把牙齿咬得咯吱咯吱响，目光阴郁地瞪着她。绿蒂握着他的手，说：

“快冷静冷静吧，维特！你难道感觉不出，你是在自己欺骗自己，存心把自己毁掉么！干吗定要爱我呢，维特？我可已是另有所属啊！干吗偏偏这样？我担心，我害怕，仅仅是因为不可能实现，才使这个占有我的欲望对你如此有诱惑力的。”

维特把自己的手从她手里抽回来，目光定定地、愤怒地瞪着她。

“高明！”他喝道，“太高明了！没准儿是阿尔伯特这么讲的吧？外交家！了不起的外交家！”

“谁都可能这样讲，”绿蒂回答，“难道世间就没有一个姑娘合你心意了么？打起精神去找吧，我发誓，你一定能找到的；要知道，一些时候以来你自寻烦恼，已经早叫我为你和我们担心了啊。打起精神来，去旅行一下，这将会、一定会使你心胸开阔起来。去找吧，找一个值得你爱的人，然后再回来和我们团聚，共享真正的友谊的幸福。”

“你这一套可以印成教科书，推荐给所有的家庭教师哩。”维特冷笑一声说，“亲爱的绿蒂！你让我稍稍安静一下，然后一切都会好了。”

“只是，维特，圣诞节前你千万别来啊！”

他正要回答，阿尔伯特进屋来了。两人只冷冷地道了一声“晚上好”，便并排在房间里踱起步来，气氛十分尴尬。维特开始讲了几句无足轻重的话，但很快又没词儿了。阿尔伯特也一样；随后，他问自己的妻子，是否已经把这样那样交给她办的事办妥；一听绿蒂回答还不曾办妥，便冲她讲了几句在维特听来不止冷淡，简直称得上是粗暴的话。维特想走又不能走，迟迟挨挨地一直到了八点钟，心里越来越烦躁，越来越不快。人家已开始摆晚饭，他才拿起自己的帽子和手杖。阿尔伯特邀他留下，他只看作是客套敷衍，冷冷道过一声谢，便离开了。

他回到家中，从为他照路的年轻佣人手里接过蜡烛，走到了卧室里，一进门便放声大哭，过不多会儿又激动地自言自语，绕室狂奔，临了和衣倒在床上，直到深夜十一点，佣人蹑手蹑脚地摸进来问少爷要不要脱靴子，才惊动了他。他让佣人替他把靴子脱了，告诉佣人明天早上不叫不要进房里来。

礼拜一一大早，他给绿蒂写了一封信。他死后，人们在他的书桌上发现了这封信，已经用火漆封好，便送给了绿蒂。从行文本身看出，信是断断续续写成的。我也就依其本来面目，分段摘引于后。

已经决定了，绿蒂，我要去死。我在给你写这句话时，并没有怀着浪漫的激情，相反，倒是心平气和，在将要最后一次见到你的今天的早上。当你捧读此信的时候，亲爱的，冰冷的黄土已经盖住了我这个不安和不幸的人的僵硬的躯体。他在自己生命的最后一刻所感到的快慰，就是能和你再谈一谈心。我熬过了一个多可怕的夜晚啊；可是，唉，这也是一个仁慈的夜晚！是它坚定了我的决心，使我最后决定去死！昨天，我忍痛离开你时，真是五内俱焚；往事一一涌上心头，一个冷酷的事实猛地摆在我面前：我生活在你身边是既无希望，也无欢乐啊……

我一回到自己房里，就疯了似的跪在地上！上帝呵，求你赐给我最后几滴苦涩的泪水，让我用它们来滋润一下自己的心田吧！在我脑海中翻腾着千百种计划，千百种前景，但最后剩下的只有一个念头，一个十分坚决、十分肯定的念头，这就是：我要去死！我躺下睡了，今儿一早醒来心情平静，可它却仍然在那里，这个存在于我心中十分强烈的念头：我要去死！——这并非绝望；这是信念，我确信自己苦已受够，是该为你而牺牲自己的时候了。是的，绿蒂，我为什么应该保持缄默呢？我们三人中的确有一个必须离开，而我，就自愿做这一个人！呵，亲爱的，在我这破碎的心灵里，确曾隐隐约约出现过一个狂暴的想法——杀死你的丈夫！——杀死你！——杀死我自己！

眼下的事就这么定了！可是将来，当你在一个美丽夏日的黄昏登上山岗，你可别忘了我啊，别忘了我也常常喜欢上这儿来；然后，你要眺望那边公墓里的我的坟茔，看我坟头的茂草如何在落日的余晖中让风吹得摇曳不定……

我开始写此信时心情是平静的；可眼下，眼下一切都生动实在地出现在我面前，我又忍不住哭了，像个孩子似的哭了。

将近十点钟，维特叫来他的佣人，一边穿外套一边对他讲，过几天他要出门去，让佣人把他的衣服刷干净，打点好全部行装。此外，又命令佣人去各处结清账目，收回几册借给人家的书，把他本来按月施舍给一些穷人的钱提前一次给两个月。

他吩咐把早饭送到他房里去。吃完饭，他骑着马去总管家；总管不在，他便一边沉思，一边在花园中踱来踱去，像是在对以往的种种伤心事作最后一次的重温。

可是，小家伙们却不让他长久地安静，他们追踪他，跳到他背上，告诉他：明天，明天的明天，喏，就是再过一天，他们就可以从绿蒂手里领到圣诞礼物了！他们向他描述自己的小脑瓜儿所能想象出来的种种奇迹。

“明天！”维特喊出来，“明天的明天！再过一天！”——随后，他挨个儿吻了孩子们，打算要走。这当儿，最小的一个男孩却要给他说悄悄话。他向维特透露，哥哥们都写了许多张美丽的贺年片，挺大挺大的，一张给爸爸，一张给阿尔伯特和绿蒂，也有一张给维特先生；只不过要到新年早上才给他们。维特深为感动，给了每个孩子一点什么，然后才上马，让孩子们代他问候他们的父亲，说完便含着热泪驰去。

将近五点，他回到住所，吩咐女仆去给卧室中的壁炉添足柴，以便火能一直维持到深夜。他还让佣人把书籍和内衣装进箱子，把外衣缝进护套。做完这些，他显然又写给了绿蒂的最后一封信的下面这个片断：

你想不到我会来吧！你以为我会听你的话，直到圣诞节晚上才来看你，是不是！呵，绿蒂！今日不见就永远不见了。到圣诞节晚上你手里捧着这封信，你的手将会颤抖，你莹洁的泪水将把信纸打湿。我愿意，我必须！我多快意呵，我决心已定！

绿蒂这段时间的心境也很特别，最后那次和维特谈话以后她就感到，要她和他分手会多么困难，而维特如果被迫离开了她，又会何等痛苦。

她像无意似的当着阿尔伯特讲了一句：“维特圣诞夜之前不会来了。”阿尔伯特于是便骑马去找住在邻近的一位官员，和他了结一些公事，不得不就在他家中过夜。

绿蒂独坐房中，身边一个弟妹也没有，便不禁集中心思考虑起自己眼前的处境来。她看出自己已终身和丈夫结合在一起；丈夫对她的爱和忠诚她是了解的，因此也打心眼里倾慕他；他的稳重可靠仿佛天生来作为一种基础，好让一位贤淑的女子在上面建立起幸福的生活似的；她感到，他对她和她的弟妹真是永远不可缺少的靠山啊。可另一方面，维特之于她又如此可贵，从相识的第一瞬间起，他俩就意气相投；后来，长时间的交往以及种种共同的经历，都在她心中留下了不可磨灭的印象，她不管感到或想到什么有趣儿的事，都已习惯于把自己的快乐和他一块儿分享；他这一走，必然给她的整个一生造成永远无法弥补的空虚。呵，要是她能马上把他变成自己的哥哥就好了！这样她会多么幸福啊！——她真希望能把自己的一个女友许配给他，真希望能恢复他和阿尔伯特的友好关系！她把自己的女友挨个儿想了一遍，发现她们身上都有这样那样的缺点，觉得没有一个配得上维特的。

这么考虑来考虑去，她才深深感觉到自己衷心地暗中希望着一件事，虽然她不肯向自己明白承认，这就是把维特留给她自己。与此同时，她又对自己讲，这是不可能的，不允许的。此刻，她纯洁、美丽、素来总是那么轻松、那么无忧无虑的心，也变得忧伤而沉重起来，失去了对于未来幸福的希望。她的胸部感到压抑，眼睛也让乌云给蒙住了。

她这么一直坐到六点半；突然，她听见维特上楼来了。她一下子便听出是他的脚步声和他打听她的声音。她的心怦怦狂跳起来；可以说，她在他到来时像这个样子还是第一次，她很想让人对他讲自己不在；当他跨进房来时，她心慌意乱得冲他叫了一声：

“你食言了！”

“我可没许任何诺言。”维特回答。

“就算这样，你也该满足我的请求呀，”她反驳说，“我求过你让我们两人都安静安静。”

她不清楚自己说些什么，也不清楚自己做些什么，糊里糊涂地就派人去请她的几个女友来，以免自己单独和维特待在一起。他呢，放下带来的几本书，又问起另外几本书。这时，绿蒂心里一会儿盼着她的女友快来，一会儿又希望她们可千万别来。使女进房回话，有两位没有来，请她原谅。

她想叫使女留在隔壁房里做针线活；但一转念又改变了主意。维特在房中踱着方步，她便坐到钢琴前，弹奏法国舞曲，但怎么也弹不流畅。维特已在他坐惯了的老式沙发上坐下；她定了定神，也不慌不忙地坐在他对面。

“你没有什么书好念念吗？”她问。

他没有。

“那边，在我的抽屉里，放着你译的几首莪相的诗，”她又说，“我还没有念它们，一直希望听你自己来念，谁知又老找不到机会。”

维特微微一笑，走过去取那几首诗；可一当把它们拿在手中，身上便不觉打了个寒颤，低头看着稿纸，眼里已噙满泪花。他坐下，念道：

朦胧夜空中的孤星呵，你在西天发出美丽的闪光，从云朵深处昂起你明亮的头，庄严地步向你的丘岗。你在这荒原上寻觅什么呢？那狂暴的风已经安静，从远方传来了溪流的絮语，喧闹的惊涛拍击岩岸，夜蛾儿成群飞过旷野，嗡嗡嘤嘤。你在这荒原上寻觅什么哟，美丽的星？瞧你微笑着冉冉行进，欢乐的浪涛簇拥着你，洗濯你的秀发。别了，安静的星。望你永照人间，你这莪相心灵中的光华！

在它的照耀下，我看见了逝去的友人，他们在罗拉平原聚会，像在过去的日子里一样。——芬戈来了，像一根潮湿的雾柱；瞧啊，在他周围他的勇士，那些古代的歌人：白发苍苍的乌林！身躯伟岸的利诺！歌喉迷人的阿尔品！还有你，自怨自艾的弥诺娜！——我的朋友呵，想当年，在塞尔玛山上，我们竞相歌唱，歌声如春风阵阵飘过山丘，窃窃私语的小草久久把头儿低昂；自那时以来，你们可真变了样！

这当儿，娇艳的弥诺娜低着头走出来，泪眼汪汪；从山岗那边不断刮来的风，吹得她浓密的头发轻扬。她放开了甜美的歌喉，勇士们的心里更加忧伤；要知道他们已一次次张望过萨格尔的坟头，一次次张望过白衣女可尔玛幽暗的住房。可尔玛形影孤单，柔声儿在山岗上唱着歌：萨格尔答应来却没来，四周已是夜色迷茫。听啊，这就是可尔玛独坐在山岗上唱的歌：

可尔玛

夜已来临！——我坐在狂风呼啸的岗头，独自一人。山中风声凄厉。山洪咆哮着跃下岩顶。可怜我这被遗弃在风雨中的女子，没有茅舍供我避雨栖身。

月儿呵，从云端里走出来吧！星星呵，在夜空中闪耀吧！请照亮我的道路，领我去我的爱人打猎后休息的地方，他身旁摆着松了弦的弓弩，他周围躺着喘吁吁的狗群。可我只得独坐杂树丛生的河畔，激流和风暴喧啸不已，我却听不见爱人一丝儿声音。

我的萨格尔为何迟疑不归？莫非他已把自己的诺言忘记？这儿就是那岩石，那树，那湍急的河流！唉，你答应天一黑就来到这里！我的萨格尔呵，你可是迷失了归途？我愿随你一起逃走，离开高傲的父亲和兄弟！我们两个家族世代为仇，萨格尔呵，我俩却不是仇敌！

风啊，你静一静吧！激流啊，你也请别出声息！让我的声音越过山谷，传到我那漂泊者的耳际。萨格尔！是我在唤你哟，萨格尔！这儿是那树，这儿是那岩石，萨格尔，我的亲爱的！我在这儿等了又等，你为何迟迟不来？

瞧，月亮发出银辉，溪流在峡谷中闪亮，丘岗上灰色的岩石突兀立起；可丘顶却不见他的身影，也没有狗群报告他的来归。我只得孤零零地坐在此地。

可躺在那下边荒野上的是谁啊，是我的爱人？是我的兄弟？——你们说话呀，我的朋友！呵，他们不回答，徒令我心增忧戚！——啊，他们死了！他们的剑上犹有斑斑血迹！我的兄弟呵，我的兄弟，你为何杀死了我的萨格尔？我的萨格尔呵，你为何杀死了我的兄弟？你们两个都是我的亲人哟！在丘岗旁安息着的万千战死者中，数你最最英俊！可是他在战斗里却可怕无敌。回答我，亲爱的人，你们可已听见我的呼唤！唉，他们永远沉默无言，胸膛已冰凉如泥！

亡灵们呵，你们从丘顶的巨岩石上讲话吧！从暴风雨中的山巅讲话吧！我绝不会毛骨悚然！告诉我，你们将去哪儿安息？我要到群山中的哪道岩穴里才能找到你们啊！——狂风中，我听不见一些儿回音；暴风雨里，我听不见微弱的叹息。

我坐在岗头大放悲声；我等待着黎明，泪雨淅沥。死者的友人们呵，你们掘好了坟墓，但在我到来之前，千万别把墓室关闭。我怎能留下呢，我的生命已消逝如梦？我愿和我的亲人同住在这岩石鸣响的溪畔；每当夜色爬上山岗，狂飙掠过旷野，我的灵魂都要立在风中，为我亲人的死哀泣。猎人在他的小屋中听见我的泣诉，既恐惧又欢喜；要知道我是在悼念自己亲爱的人，声音又怎能不甜蜜！

这就是你的歌啊，弥诺娜，托尔曼的红颜的闺女。我们的泪为可尔玛而流，我们的心为她忧戚。

乌林怀抱竖琴登场，为我们伴奏阿尔品的歌唱。——阿尔品嗓音悦耳，利诺有火一般的心肠。可眼下他们都已安息在陋室中，他们的歌声已在塞尔玛绝响。有一次乌林猎罢归来，还在英雄们未曾战死的时光。他听见他们在山上比赛唱歌，歌声悠扬，但却忧伤。他们悲叹领袖群伦的英雄穆拉尔的陨落，说他的宝剑厉害如奥斯卡，他的灵魂高尚如芬戈。——但他仍然倒下了，他的父亲悲痛失声，他的姐姐泪流成河，英俊的穆拉尔的姐姐弥诺娜泪流成河。她在乌林唱歌以前便下去了，恰似西天的月亮预见到暴风雨来临，将美丽的脸儿向云里躲藏。我和乌林一同拨响琴弦，伴着利诺悲哀地歌唱。

利诺

风雨已过，雾散云开，天气晴朗，匆匆去来的太阳又照着山岗。溪流红光闪闪，穿过峡谷，淙淙潺潺，笑语欢畅。可我聆听着一个更动人的声音，那是阿尔品的声音，他在痛苦地把死者歌唱。他哀老的头颅低垂，他带泪的眼睛红肿。阿尔品，杰出的歌手，你为何独自来到这无声的山上？为你何悲声不断，像穿越山林的风，像拍击洋岸的浪？

阿尔品

利诺呵，我的泪为死者而流，我的歌为墓中人而唱。在荒野的儿子们中间，在岗头，你是何等英俊魁梧。但你也像穆拉尔一样战死，你的坟上也会有痛哭悲伤。这些山岗将把你忘记，你的弓弩将存放在大厅，从此不把弦张。

穆拉尔呵，在这山岗上你曾飞奔如快鹿，狂暴如野火。你的愤怒如可怕的飓风，你的宝剑如荒野的闪电，你的声音如雨后的山洪，如远方山岗上的雷动！多少人曾被你愤怒的烈火吞噬，多少人曾死在你手中，可当你从战斗里归来，额头上又洋溢着宁静！你的容颜如雨后的丽日，如静夜的月亮：你的胸膛呼吸均匀，如风住浪息的海洋！

如今，你的居室湫隘、黑暗，你的墓穴长不过三步：而你当初却是多么伟大呵！四块顶上长满青苔的石板砌成你唯一的纪念碑，还有无叶的树一株。一茎长草在风中低语，告诉猎人，这儿就是伟大的穆拉尔的归宿！没有母亲来为你哭泣，没有情人来为你一洒青泪。生育你的莫格兰的女儿，她已经先你亡故。

那扶杖走来的是谁呢？他的头发已经老得雪白，他的双眼已经哭得红肿。呵，那是你的父亲，穆拉尔，你是他唯一的儿子！他曾听见你在战斗中高声呐喊，他曾听见你打得敌人四处逃窜；他只听见你如雷的声名，唉，全不知你身负重伤！痛哭吧，穆拉尔的父亲！痛哭吧，尽管你儿子已听不见你的声音！死者酣睡沉沉，头枕尘埃，充耳不闻你的呼唤，永远不会复生。呵，墓穴中何时才会有黎明，才会召唤酣睡者：醒一醒！

别了，人中的最高贵者，沙场上无敌的勇士！从此战斗中再见不到你的英姿，幽林间再不会闪过你雪亮的兵刃！你没有子嗣继承伟业，但歌声将使你不朽，后世将听到你，听到战死沙场的穆拉尔的英名。

英雄们个个放声啼哭，阿明更是撕心裂肺地号啕。他悼念他的亡儿，痛惜他青春年华即已早夭。辽阔的格马尔的君王卡莫尔坐在老英雄身边，问：“阿明呵，你为何在痛哭流涕？是什么叫你大放悲声？且听这声声弦歌，真个叫悦耳迷人！它好似湖上升起的薄雾，轻轻儿飘进幽谷，把盛开的花朵滋润；可一当烈日重新照临，这雾啊也就散尽。你为何悲恸伤心啊，阿明，你这岛国哥尔马的至尊？”

“悲恸伤心！可不是吗，我的悲痛真诉说不尽。卡莫尔呵，你没有失去儿子，没有失去如花的女儿；勇敢的哥尔格还健在，天下最美的姑娘安妮拉还侍奉着你。你的家族枝繁叶茂，卡莫尔；可我阿明家却断了后嗣。岛拉呵，你的床头如此昏暗，你已在发霉的墓穴中长眠。什么时候你才会唱着歌醒来呢，你的歌喉可还是那样美，那样甜？刮起来吧，秋风，刮过这黑暗的原野！怒吼吧，狂飙，在山顶的橡树林中掀起巨澜！明月呵，请你从破碎的云絮后走出来，让我看一看你苍白的脸！你们都来帮我回忆吧，回忆我失去儿女的恐怖的夜晚：那一夜，强壮的阿林达尔死了，岛拉，我亲爱的女儿，她也未得生还。

“岛拉，我的女儿，你曾多么美丽！你美丽如悬挂在弗拉山岗上的皓月，洁白如天空飘下来的雪花，甜蜜如芳馨的空气！阿林达尔，你的弓弩强劲，你的标枪快捷，你的眼光如浪尖上的迷雾，你的盾牌如暴雨里的彤云！

“战争中遐迩闻名的阿玛尔来向岛拉求爱；岛拉没有能长久拒绝。朋友们已期待着那美好的时辰。

“奥德戈的儿子埃拉德怒不可遏，他的弟弟曾死在阿尔玛剑下。他乔装成一名船夫，驾来一叶轻舟，他的鬈发已老得雪白，脸色也和悦敦厚。‘最最美丽的姑娘啊，’他说，‘阿明可爱的女儿！在离岸不远的海里，在鲜红的水果从树上向这儿窥视的山崖旁，阿玛尔在那里等待他的岛拉，我奉命来接他的爱人，带她越过波涛翻滚的海洋。’

“岛拉跟着埃拉德上了船，口里不断呼唤阿玛尔：可她除去山崖的鸣响，就再听不见任何回答。‘阿玛尔！我的爱人，我亲爱的！你干吗要这样把我恐吓？听一听啊，阿纳兹的儿子！听一听呵，是我在唤你，我是你的岛拉！’

“埃拉德这个骗子，他狂笑着逃上陆地。岛拉拼命地喊啊，喊她的父亲，喊她的兄长的名字：‘阿林达尔！阿明！难道你们谁也不来救救他的岛拉？’

“她的喊声从海上传来，阿林达尔，我的儿子立刻从山岗跃下。终日行猎使他性格剽悍，他身挎箭矢，手执强弓，五只黑灰色猎犬紧紧跟随身边，他在海岸上瞧见勇敢的埃拉德，一把捉住他，把他缚在橡树上，用绳子将他的腰身缠了又缠，缚得埃拉德在海风中叫苦连天。

“阿林达尔驾着自己的船破浪前进，一心要救岛拉生还。阿玛尔气急败坏赶来，射出了他的灰翎利箭，只听嗖的一声响，阿林达尔呵，我的儿，射进了你的心田！你代替埃拉德丧了命。船一到岸边，他就倒下了。岛拉呵，你脚边淌着你兄长的鲜血，你真是悲痛难言！

“这当儿巨浪击破了小船，阿玛尔奋身纵入大海，不知是为救他的岛拉，还是自寻短见。一霎时狂风大作，白浪滔天，阿玛尔沉入海底，一去不返。

“只剩我一人在海浪冲击的悬崖上，听着女儿的哭诉。她呼天抢地，我身为她的父亲，却无法救她脱险。我彻夜伫立在岸边，在淡淡的月光里看见她，听着她的呼喊。风呼呼地吼，雨刷刷地抽打山岩。不等黎明到来，她的喊声已经微弱；当夜色在草丛中消散，她已经气息奄奄。她在悲痛的重压下死去了，留下了我阿明孤苦一人！我的勇力已在战争里用光，我的骄傲已被姑娘们耗完。

“每当山头雷雨交加，北风掀起狂澜，我就坐在发出轰响的岸旁，遥望那可怕的岩石。在西沉的月影里，我常常看见我孩子们的幽魂，时隐时现，缥缥缈缈，哀伤而和睦地携手同行……”

两股热泪从绿蒂的眼中迸流出来，她心里感觉轻松了一些，维特却再也念不下去。他丢下诗稿，抓住绿蒂的一只手，失声痛哭，绿蒂的头俯在另一只手上，用手绢捂住了眼睛。他俩的情绪激动得真叫可怕，从那些高贵的人的遭遇中，他们都体会出了自身的不幸。这相同的感情和流在一起的泪水，使他俩靠得更紧了。维特灼热的嘴唇和眼睛，全靠在了绿蒂的手臂上。她猛然惊醒，心里想要站起来离开；可是，悲痛和怜悯却使她动弹不得，她的手跟脚如同铅块。她喘息着，哽咽着，请求他继续念下去；她这时的声音之动人，真只有天使可比！维特浑身哆嗦，心都要碎了。他拾起诗稿，断断续续地念道：

春风呵，你为何将我唤醒？你轻轻抚摩着我的身儿回答：“我要滋润你以天上的甘霖！”可是啊，我的衰时近了，风暴即将袭来，吹打得我枝叶飘零！明天，有位旅人将要到来，他见过我的美好青春，他的眼儿将在旷野里四处寻觅，却不见我的踪影……

这几句诗的魔力，一下子攫住了不幸的青年。他完全绝望了，一头扑在绿蒂脚下，抓住她的双手，把它们先按在自己的眼睛上，再按在自己的额头上。绿蒂呢，心里也一下子闪过维特会做出什么可怕的事情来的预感，神志顿时昏乱起来，抓住他的双手，把它们捺在自己的胸口上，激动而伤感地弯下身子，两人灼热的脸颊便依偎在一起了。世界对于他们已不复存在。他用胳膊搂住她的身子，把她紧紧抱在怀中，同时狂吻起她颤抖的、嗫嚅的嘴唇来。“维特！”她的声音窒息地喊着，极力把头扭开。“维特！”她用软弱无力的手去推开他和她紧贴在一起的胸。“维特！”她再喊，声音克制而庄重。

维特不再反抗，从怀里放开她，疯了似的跪倒在她脚下。她站起来，对他既恼又爱，身子不住哆嗦，心里更惊慌迷乱，只说：“这是最后一次，维特！你别想再见到我了！”说完，向这个可怜的人投了深情的一瞥，便逃进隔壁房中，把门锁上了。维特向她伸出手去，但却没敢抓住她。随后他仰卧地上，头枕沙发，一动不动地呆了半个多小时，直到一些响声使他如梦初醒。是使女来摆晚饭了。他在房中来回踱着，等发现又只有他一个人，才走到通向隔壁的房门前，轻声呼唤道：

“绿蒂！绿蒂！只要再说一句！一句告别的话！”

绿蒂不作声。他等待着，请求着，再等待着；最后才扭转身，同时喊出：

“别了，绿蒂！永别了！”

他来到城门口。守门人已经认熟了他，一句话没问便放他出了城。野地里雨雪交加；直到夜里十一点，他才回家敲门。年轻的佣人发现，主人进屋时头上的帽子已经不见了。他一声没敢吭，只侍候维特脱下已经湿透的衣服。事后，在临着深谷的悬崖上，人家捡到了他的帽子。叫人难以想象的是，他怎能在漆黑的雨夜登上高崖，竟没有失足摔下去。

他上了床，睡了很久很久。翌日清晨，佣人听他一唤便送咖啡进去，发现他正在写信。他在致绿蒂的信上又添了下面一段。

最后一次了，最后一次我睁开眼睛。唉，它们就要再也见不到太阳，永远被一个暗淡无光、雾霭迷蒙的长昼给遮住了！痛悼吧，自然！你的儿子，你的朋友，你的情人，他的生命就要结束了。绿蒂呵，当一个人不得不对自己说“这是我的最后一个早晨”时，他心中便会有一种无可比拟、然而却最最接近于朦胧的梦的感觉。最后一个！绿蒂呵，我真完全不理解这个什么“最后一个”！难道此刻，我不是还身强力壮地站在这儿；可明天就要倒卧尘埃，了无生气了啊。死！死意味着什么？你瞧，当我们谈到死时，我们就像在做梦。我曾目睹一些人怎样死；然而人类生来就有很大的局限，他们对自己生命的开始与结束，从来都是不能理解的。眼下还存在我的，你的！你的，呵，亲爱的！可再过片刻……分开，离别……说不定就是永别了啊！……不，绿蒂，不……我怎么能逝去呢？你怎么能逝去呢？我们不是存在着吗！……逝去……这又意味着什么？还不只是一个词儿！一个没有意义的声音！我才没心思管它哩……死，绿蒂，被埋在冰冷的黄土里，那么狭窄，那么黑暗！……我曾有一个女友，在我无以自立的少年时代，她乃是我的一切。她后来死了，我跟随她的遗体去到她的墓旁，亲眼看见人家把她的棺木放下坑去，抽出棺下的绳子并且扯上来，然后便开始填土。土块落在那可怕的匣子上，咚咚直响；响声越来越沉闷，到最后墓坑整个给填了起来！这当儿我忍不住一下子扑到墓前……心痛欲裂，号啕悲恸，震惊恐惧到了极点；尽管如此，却不明白究竟出了什么事，会出什么事……死亡！坟墓！这些词儿我真不理解啊！

呵，原谅我！原谅我！昨天的事！那会儿我真要死了才好哩。我的天使哟！第一次，破天荒第一次，在我内心深处确凿无疑地涌现了这个令我热血沸腾的幸福感觉：她爱我！她爱我！此刻，我的嘴唇上还燃烧着从你的嘴唇传过来的圣洁的烈火，使我心中不断生出新的温暖和喜悦。原谅我吧！原谅我！

唉，我早知道你是爱我的，从一开始你对我的几次热情顾盼中，在我俩第一次握手时，我便知道你爱我；可后来，当我离开了你，当我在你身边看见阿尔伯特，我又产生了怀疑，因而感到焦灼和痛苦。

你还记得你给我的那些花么？在那次令人心烦的聚会中，你不能和我交谈，不能和我握手，便送了这些花给我；我在它们面前跪了半夜，它们使我确信了你对我的爱啊。可是，唉，这些印象不久便淡漠了，正如一个在领了实实在在的圣体以后内心无比幸福的基督徒，他那蒙受上帝恩赐的幸福感也渐渐会从心中消失一般。

一切都须臾即逝啊，唯有昨天我从你嘴唇上啜饮的生命之火，眼下我感觉它们在我体内燃烧，而且时光尽管流逝，它却永远不会熄灭。她爱我！这条胳膊曾经搂抱过她，这嘴唇在她的嘴唇上颤抖过，这口曾在她的口边低语过。她是我的！——你是我的！对，绿蒂，你永远永远是我的！

阿尔伯特是你丈夫，这又怎么样呢？哼，丈夫！难道我爱你，想把你从他的怀抱中夺到我的怀抱中来，对于这个世界就是罪孽么？罪孽！好，为此我情愿受罚；但我已尝到了这个罪孽的全部甘美滋味，已把生命的琼浆和力量吸进了我心里。从这一刻起你便是我的了！我的了，呵，绿蒂！我要先去啦，去见我的天父，你的天父！我将向他诉说我的不幸，他定会安慰我，直到你到来；那时，我将奔向你，拥抱你，将当着无所不在的上帝的面，永远永远和你拥抱在一起。

我不是在做梦，不是在说胡话！在即将进入坟墓之时，我心中更豁亮了。我们会，我们会再见的！我们将见到你的母亲！我们会见着她，找到她，呵，在她面前倾吐我的衷诚！因为你的母亲，她和你本是一个人呀！

将近十一时，维特问他的佣人，阿尔伯特是否已回来了。佣人回答是的，他已看见阿尔伯特骑着马跑过去。随后，维特便递给他一张没有用信封装的便条，内容是：

我拟出外旅行，把你的手枪借我一用好吗？谨祝万事如意！

可爱的绿蒂昨晚上迟迟未能入睡；她所害怕的事情终于证实了，以她不曾预料、不曾担心过的方式证实了。她那一向流得平匀轻快的血液，这时激荡沸腾开来，千百种情感交集着，把她的芳心给搅得乱糟糟的。这是维特在拥抱她时传到她胸中的情火的余焰呢，还是她为维特的放肆失礼而生气的怒火呢？还是她把自己眼前的处境，和过去无忧无虑、天真无邪、充满自信的日子相比较，因此心中深感不快呢？叫她怎么去见自己的丈夫？叫她怎样向他说清楚那一幕啊？——她本来完全可以直言不讳地告诉他，可是到底没有勇气。他俩久久地相对无言；难道她应该首先打破沉默，向自己丈夫交代那一意外的事件，在这不是时候的时候？她担心，仅仅一提起维特来过，就会给丈夫造成不快，更何况那意想不到的灾难！她未必能指望，她丈夫会完全明智地看待这件事，在态度中一点不带成见吧？她能希望，丈夫愿意明辨她的心迹吗？然而，另一方面，她又怎么可以对自己丈夫装模作样呢？要知道，在他面前，她从来都像水晶般纯洁透明，从来未曾隐讳——也不可能隐讳自己的任何感情。这样做，她有顾虑；那样做，也有顾虑，处境十分尴尬。与此同时，她的思想还一再回到对于她来说已经失去了的维特身上；她丢不开他，又不得不丢开他；而维特没有了她，便没有了一切。

她当时还不完全清楚，那在她和阿尔伯特之间出现的隔膜，对她是个多么沉重的负担。两个本来都如此理智、如此善良的人，开始由于某些暗中存在的分歧而相对无言了，各人都在心头想着自己的是和对方的非，情况便会越弄越复杂，越弄越糟糕，以致到头来变成了一个压根儿再也解不开的死结。设若她俩能早一些讲清楚，设若他俩之间互爱互谅的关系能早一些恢复，心胸得以开阔起来，那么，在此千钧一发关头，我们的朋友也许还有救。

此外，还有一点特别值得提提。如我们从他的信中知道，维特是从来也不讳言自己渴望离开这个世界的。对这个问题，阿尔伯特常常和他争论，并在绿蒂夫妇之间也不时谈起。阿尔伯特对自杀行为一贯深恶痛绝，不止一次甚至一反常态地激烈表示，他很有理由怀疑维特的这个打算是当真的，并且因此取笑过他几次，也把自己的怀疑告诉过绿蒂。这一方面固然使绿蒂在想到那可能出现的悲剧时宽心了一点，另一方面却又叫她难于启齿，向丈夫诉说眼下苦恼着她的忧虑。

阿尔伯特回到家，绿蒂急忙迎着，神色颇有些窘；他呢，事情没有办好，碰上邻近的那个官员是个不通情理的小气鬼，心头也不痛快，加之道路很难走，更使他没有好气儿。

他问家中有没有什么事情；绿蒂慌慌张张地回答：“维特昨晚上来啦！”他问有无信件，绿蒂说一封信和一个包裹已放在他房中。他回自己房间去了，又剩下绿蒂一个人。她所爱的和尊敬的丈夫的归来，在她心中唤起一种新的情绪。回想到他的高尚、他的温柔和他的善良，绿蒂的心便平静多了。她感到有一股神秘的吸引力，使她身不由己地要跟着他走去，于是便拿起针线，像往常一样跨进了他的房间。她发现阿尔伯特正忙着开包裹和读信；信的内容看来颇不令人愉快。她问了丈夫几句话，他回答却很简单，随即就坐在书桌前写起信来。

夫妇俩这么在一起待了一个钟头，绿蒂的心中越来越阴郁。她这会儿才感到，她丈夫的情绪就算好极了，自己也很难把压在心上的事向他剖白。绿蒂堕入了深沉的悲哀之中。与此同时，她却力图将自己的悲哀隐藏起来，把眼泪吞回肚子里去，这更令她加倍难受。

维特的佣人一来，她简直狼狈到了极点。佣人把维特的便条交给阿尔伯特，他读了便漫不经心地转过头来对绿蒂道：

“把手枪给他，”随即对维特的仆人说，“我祝他旅途愉快。”

这话在绿蒂耳里犹如一声响雷。她摇摇晃晃站起来，不知自己在干什么。她一步步挨到墙边，哆哆嗦嗦地取下枪，擦去枪上的灰尘，迟疑了半晌没有交出去；要不是阿尔伯特的询问的目光逼着她，她必定还会拖很久很久。她把那不祥之物递给仆人，一句话也讲不出来。佣人出门去了，她便收拾起自己的活计，返回自己房中，心里却七上八下，说不出有多么忧虑。她预感到种种可怕的事情。因此，一会儿，她决心去跪在丈夫脚下，向他承认一切，承认昨天晚上发生的事，承认她的过错以及她的预感；一会儿，她又觉得这样做不会有好结果，她能说服丈夫去维特那儿的希望微乎其微。这时，晚饭已经摆好；她的一个好朋友来问点什么事情，原打算马上走的，结果却留了下来，使席间的气氛变得轻松了一些。绿蒂控制住自己，大伙儿谈谈讲讲，不知不觉时间就过去了。

佣人拿着枪走进维特的房间；一听说枪是绿蒂亲手交给他的，维特便怀着狂喜一把夺了过去。他吩咐给他送来了面包和酒，让他的佣人去吃饭，自己却坐下写起信来：

它们经过了你的手，你还擦去了上面的灰尘；我把它们吻了一遍又一遍，因为你曾接触过它们。绿蒂呵，我的天使，是你成全我实现自己的决心！是你，绿蒂，是你把枪交给了我；我曾经渴望从你手中接受死亡，如今我的心愿得以满足了！唔，我盘问过我那小伙子；当你递枪给他时，你的手在颤抖，你连一句“再见”也没有讲！——可悲，可悲！连一句“再见”也没有！难道为了那把我和你永远联结起来的一瞬，你就把我从心中放逐出去了么？绿蒂啊，哪怕再过一千年，也不会把我对那一瞬的印象磨灭！我感觉到，你是不可能恨一个如此热恋你的人的。

饭后，维特叫佣人把行李全部捆好，自己撕毁了许多信函，随后再出去清理了几桩债务。事毕回到家来，可过不多会儿又冒雨跑出门去，走进已故的伯爵的花园里，在这废园中转来转去，一直流连到了夜幕降临，才回家来写信：

威廉，我已最后一次去看了田野，看了森林，还有天空。你也多珍重吧！亲爱的母亲，请原谅我！威廉，为我安慰安慰她啊！愿上帝保佑你们！我的事情全都已料理好。别了！我们会再见的，到那时将比现在多些欢乐。

我对不起你，阿尔伯特，请原谅我吧。我破坏了你家庭的和睦，造成了你俩之间的猜忌。别了！我自愿结束这一切。哦，但愿我的死能带给你们幸福！阿尔伯特，阿尔伯特，使我们的天使幸福吧！你要是做到了，上帝就会保佑你啊！

晚上，他又在自己的文书中翻了很久，撕碎和烧毁了其中的许多。然后，他在几个写着威廉的地址的包裹上打好漆封。包内是些记载着他的零星杂感的短文，我过去也曾见过几篇。十点钟，他叫佣人给壁炉添了柴，送来一瓶酒，随即便打发小伙子去睡觉。佣人和房东的卧室都在离得很远的后院，小伙子一回去便和衣倒上床睡了，以便第二天一大早就去伺候主人；他的主人讲过，明天六点以前邮车就要到门口来。





夜里十一点过


周围万籁无声，我心里也同样宁静。我感谢你，上帝，感谢你赐给我最后的时刻以如此多的温暖和力量。

我走到窗前，仰望夜空。我亲爱的人呵，透过汹涌的、急飞过我头顶的乌云，我仍看见在茫茫的空际有一颗颗明星！不，你们不会陨落！永恒的主宰在他的心中托负着你们，托负着我。我看见了群星中最美丽的北斗星。每当我晚上离开了你，每当我跨出你家大门，它就总挂在我的头上。望着它，我常常真是如醉如痴啊！我常常向它举起双手，把它看成是我眼前幸福的神圣象征和吉兆！还有那……哦，绿蒂，什么东西不会叫我想起你呢？在我周围无处没有你！不是么，我不是像个小孩子似的，把你神圣的手指碰过的一切小玩意儿，都贪得无厌地强占为己有么？

这张可爱的剪影画，我把它遗赠给你，绿蒂！请你珍惜它吧，我在它上面何止吻过千次。每逢出门或回家来。我都要向它挥手告别或者致意。

我给你父亲留了一张字条，请他保护我的遗体。在公墓后面朝向田野的一角，长着两株菩提树，我希望安息在那里。你父亲能够，也必定会为他的朋友帮这个忙的。希望你也替我求他一下。我不想勉强虔诚的基督徒把自己的躯体安放在一个可怜的不幸者旁边[1]。唉，我希望你们把我葬在路旁，或者幽寂的山谷中，好让过往的祭师和辅祭能在我的墓碑前祝福，撒马利亚人[2]能洒下泪水几滴。

时候到了，绿蒂！我捏住这冰冷的、可怕的枪柄，心中毫无畏惧，恰似端起一个酒杯，从这杯中，我将把死亡的香醪痛饮！是你把它递给了我，我还有什么可犹豫。一切一切，我生活中的一切希望和梦想，都由此得到了满足！此刻，我就可以冷静地，无动于衷地，去敲死亡的铁门了。

绿蒂啊，只要能为你死，为你献身，我就是幸福的！我愿勇敢地死，高高兴兴地死，只要我的死能给你的生活重新带来宁静，带来快乐。可是，唉，人世间只有很少高尚的人肯为自己的亲眷抛洒热血，以自己的死在他们的友朋中鼓动起新的、百倍的生之勇气。

我希望就穿着身上这些衣服下葬，因为绿蒂你曾经接触过它们，使它们变得神圣了。就这一点，我也在信上请求了你父亲。我的灵魂将飘浮在灵柩上。别让人翻我的衣袋。这个淡红色的蝴蝶结儿，是我第一次在你弟妹中间见到你时，你戴在胸前的……哦，为我多多地吻孩子们，给他们讲他们不幸的朋友的故事。可爱的孩子们啊！他们眼下好像还围在我身边哩！唉，我是多么依恋你呀！自从与你相见，我就再离不开你！……这个蝴蝶结儿，我希望把它和我葬在一起。还是在我过生日那天，你把它送给了我的哟！我真是如饥似渴地接受了你的一切！没想到，唉，我的结局竟是这样！……镇静一点！我求你，镇静点吧！……

子弹已经装好……钟正敲十二点！就这样吧！……绿蒂，绿蒂！别了啊，别了！

有位邻居看见火光闪了一下，接着听见一声枪响，但是随后一切复归于寂静，便没有再留意。

第二天早上六点，佣人端着灯走进房来，发现维特躺在地上，身旁是手枪和血。他唤他，扶他坐起来；维特一声不答，只是还在喘气。仆人跑去请大夫，通知阿尔伯特。绿蒂听见门铃响，浑身顿时战栗开了。她叫醒丈夫，两人一同起来；维特的年轻仆人哭喊着，结巴着，报告了凶信。绿蒂一听便昏倒在阿尔伯特跟前。

等大夫赶到出事地点，发现躺在地上的维特已经没救，脉搏倒还在跳，可四肢已经僵硬。维特对准右眼上方的额头开了一枪，脑浆都迸出来了。大夫不必要地割开他胳膊上的一条动脉，血流出来，可他仍有喘息。

从靠椅扶手上的血迹断定，他是坐在书桌前完成此举的，随后却摔到地上，痛得围着椅子打滚。最后，他仰卧着，面对窗户，再也没有动弹的力气。此刻，他仍穿的是那套他心爱的服装：长筒皮靴，青色燕尾服，再配上黄色的背心。

房东一家、左邻右舍以及全城居民都惊动了。阿尔伯特走进房来，维特已被众人放到床上，额头扎着绷带，脸色已成死灰，四肢一动不动。只有肺部还在可怕地喘哮着，一会儿轻，一会儿重，大伙儿都盼着他快点断气。

昨夜要的酒他只喝了一杯。书桌上摊开着一本《艾米莉亚·迦洛蒂》[3]。

关于阿尔伯特的震惊和绿蒂的悲恸，我就不用讲了。

老总管闻讯匆匆赶来，泪流满面地亲吻垂死的维特。他的几个大一点的儿子也接踵而至，一齐跪倒床前，放声大哭，吻了他的手，吻了他的嘴。尤其是平日最得维特喜欢的老大，更是一直吻着他，直至他断气，人家才把这孩子给强行拖开。维特断气的时间是正午十二点。由于总管亲临现场并作过布置，才防止了市民蜂拥而至。当晚十一点不到，他便吩咐大伙儿把维特葬在他自行选定的墓地里。老人领着儿子们走在维特的遗体后面；阿尔伯特没能来，绿蒂的生命叫他担忧。几名手工匠人抬着维特，没有任何教士来给他送葬。

译后记


漫话《维特》


约翰·沃尔夫冈·歌德（1749—1832），德国十八世纪下半叶和十九世纪初最杰出的诗人、作家、学者和思想家。他以自己毕生的辛勤劳作，给德国和人类留下一笔光辉巨大、丰富多彩的精神财富。

1774年，歌德出版了他早年最重要的一部作品……——《少年维特的烦恼》（简称《维特》）。这在德国文学史上，是一件具有划时代意义的大事，不仅使年仅二十五岁的歌德因而成为德国乃至欧洲最享盛誉的作家，一向被人轻视的德国文学也被提高到了与欧洲先进国家并驾齐驱的地位。在1832年《浮士德》第二部问世前，歌德这位“最伟大的德国人”便一直作为《维特》的作者闻名于世。

影响如此巨大的《维特》是部怎样的书？这部书有何价值与意义？

《维特》是一部规模不大的长篇小说，特点是采用了第一人称的书信体。全书共分三个部分：第一、二部分纯粹由主人公维特致友人威廉和女友绿蒂的书简构成；第三部分则是本书“编者”威廉写的后记，中间也穿插着维特临死前写的四封信和几则残简。此外，书前尚有一段“编者”的小引，说明编成此书的“由来”和“用意”。

小说的情节可谓简单，贯穿全书的主线为主人公不幸的恋爱与社会遭遇。根据笔者个人的理解与体会，也不妨称这部书为“青年维特碰壁逃亡记”——

第一次出逃。为摆脱旧日生活中的烦恼，维特来到一个陌生的小城。其时正是春光明媚的五月，他立即投身在美丽大自然的怀抱中，终日读着庄严宁静的荷马古诗，与天真的儿童和纯朴的村民接近，于是感到有一种奇妙的欢愉充溢着整个的灵魂。稍后，他又在舞会上认识了一位聪明俏丽的绿蒂姑娘。他明知绿蒂已经订婚，却仍对她一见钟情，并很快搬到她家附近去居住，觉得自己好像进了“天国”，而绿蒂就是这个“天国”中的“天使”。可叹好景不长，绿蒂的未婚夫阿尔伯特从外地一回来，维特便从他这幻想的“天国”中摔到了地上，处于十分尴尬的境地。于是烦恼又代替了宁静，失望又代替了欢欣，就连美丽的大自然也变成了折磨他的“鬼魅”了。维特只好逃出这个已经失去欢乐的“乐园”。

第二次出逃。维特到了一个公使馆里当秘书，一开始总算从实际工作中得到了一些慰藉，谁知上司是个偏狭迂阔的官僚，对他的工作和交往多所挑剔，使维特在他手下当差如在“苦役船”上一般难受。维特好不容易忍耐到第二年春天，却又碰见了一件更难堪的事：维特应邀在某伯爵家做客，一班傲慢顽固的贵族对于这个市民阶级的青年在场大为不满，伯爵只好催请他离去。此事立即成了全城尽人皆知的“丑闻”。羞愤之下，维特“真恨不得抓起刀来，刺进自己的心窝里去”。

第三次出逃。一年之后，在落木萧萧的初秋，因在社会上四处碰壁而心灰意懒的维特又逃回到了绿蒂身边。可这时绿蒂已经结婚，他的“乐园”也不复存在：大自然秋风萧瑟，最小最可爱的一个村童已经死去，纯朴善良的村民一个个身遭不幸，就连两株维特与全村老小十分珍爱的胡桃树，也被贪财的村长伙同其新主人砍掉了………

维特终于从一个精神病患者的话里悟出，所谓幸福只存在于疯子的头脑里。

第四次出逃。维特对现实生活已经绝望，唯有逃到爱情中去寻找寄托，便更狂热地恋慕着有夫之妇绿蒂。可这无异于饮鸩止渴，既招来他人物议，又引起阿尔伯特疑忌，绿蒂不得不赶走他。

第五次出逃。残冬到了，维特深感自己成了世界上多余的人，便怀着痛苦与愤懑的心情最后一次出逃，逃向了“混沌与黑暗”，逃向了死亡，因为……——“别无他途”！

以上便是《维特》的主要故事，但他并非出自作者的虚构；而是歌德根据1772年自杀身死的青年耶路撒冷的不幸遭遇，并糅合进自己两年来的痛苦经历、思想和感情写成的。女主人公绿蒂就是他一位朋友的未婚妻夏绿蒂·布甫的化身，年轻的诗人确曾热恋过她；别的重要人物同样在现实生活中有不止一个原型。所以歌德自己说，《维特》这部作品是他“用自己的心血哺育出来的。其中有大量出自我心胸中的东西，有大量的情感和思想足够写一部比此书长十倍的长篇小说”。

然而，不能因此说，《维特》只是一部个人的恋爱与社会遭遇的悲剧。因为，正如十九世纪的丹麦大批评家勃兰兑斯等早就指出的，它还表现了一个时代的烦恼、憧憬以及苦闷。

《维特》出现在欧洲从封建主义向资本主义过渡的历史转折时期。经过了文艺复兴和启蒙运动，市民阶级的阶级意识已经觉醒，年轻的一代更是感情激荡，强烈要求改变自己在政治上的无权地位，打破社会上严格的等级界线，建立“自然的”、“平等的”人与人关系。他们以“个性解放”、“感情自由”等口号来反对封建束缚。但与此同时，封建贵族阶级仍牢牢掌握着政权，在其军队和国家机器面前，年轻的资产阶级感到自己十分软弱无力，因而普遍滋生了悲观失望、愤懑伤感的情绪。在一段时间里，伤感多愁成了一种时髦。1772年在故乡法兰克福养病期间，歌德就参加过一个由见花落泪、对月伤情的时髦男女组成的团体。而在文学中，感伤主义的小说以及市民悲剧也应运而生。《维特》便是在这种时代气氛和文学潮流中出现的。它那位耽于幻想，多愁善感、愤世嫉俗的主人公，便是当时一代青年的代表。他代表他们，述说了自己的理想与憧憬，并以其一次次碰壁失望后的悲伤哭泣，“对横跨在市民的现实和自己对这个现实所抱的同样是市民的幻想之间的鸿沟”（恩格斯语），发出凄惨的哀号。从这个意义上讲，《维特》反映了十八世纪这个历史转折时期资产阶级所感到的狼狈和痛苦。

而在欧洲大陆各国中，情况最糟糕的又数仍处于封建小诸侯统治下的德国。在这里，“一切都烂透了，动摇了，眼看就要坍塌了，简直没有一线好转的希望”（见恩格斯《德国现状》）。另一方面，德国的资产阶级由于历史和经济原因却最软弱，根本没有力量与勇气像在英、法等国那样去作改变现状的实际尝试。他们中最先进的人物也只能在文学与哲学中去寻求自由，幻想未来，一般平庸之辈就更是向封建势力妥协投降了。所以，我们在《维特》这部作品中看见的德国社会，城市里充满了迂腐的贵族和庸俗的小市民，乡村中到处是不幸者。所以，维特只能一次次逃走以至最后自杀，因为——…“别无他途”！

对于这个使卓有才智、心地高尚的青年无以存身的社会，歌德通过主人公维特之口进行了多方面的抨击和诅咒；维特恰恰自杀于圣诞节前一天，临死还读了莱辛的抗暴悲剧《艾米莉亚·迦洛蒂》，就更清楚地表示了他对社会的愤懑和抗议。但也仅仅如此而已，软弱的性格注定了他不可能有更勇敢的行动，虽然这已比恩格斯说的“处在（德国）这粪堆中却很舒服”的平庸资产者要高尚一些。

能不能说，维特的悲剧是性格的悲剧呢？诚然，他的性格是病态的；但这病态的性格一如上述乃是时代和阶级的产物，维特即是十八世纪欧洲流行的那种“时代病”的一名重症患者。

能不能说，维特的悲剧仅仅产生于他不幸的爱情和生活际遇呢？也不完全，我们知道，爱情是一个社会问题，历来都反映着时代与社会的风貌。而在《维特》这部小说中，仅仅因婚姻恋爱问题而死、而疯、而犯罪的不幸者还有好几个，并且几乎都是由礼法、财产、等级悬殊社会限制造成的。

综上所述，《维特》应该说是欧洲十八世纪这个过渡历史时期的悲剧，软弱无力的德国资产阶级的悲剧，落后腐朽的德国社会的悲剧。而这，便是《维特》这部作品的价值和意义。

不过，以上所述，仍然不能讲已经穷尽歌德这部杰作极其丰富的思想内涵。年轻主人公对大自然的热情讴歌，对天真无邪的儿童的热爱，对淳朴的古代社会的向往，还有他视死亡为回返自然父亲的怀抱，所有这些，统统都表现了作者返归自然的启蒙思想和哲学观。

《维特》一问世，当即风靡了德国和整个西欧。广大青年不仅读它，而且纷纷模仿主人公的穿戴打扮、风度举止，更有少数人学他而自杀了的。大诗人如克罗卜斯托克也为《维特》所倾倒，拿破仑读它甚至达七遍之多。与此同时，《维特》却遭到形形色色卫道士的诟骂，被斥为“淫书”，“不道德的该遭天谴的书”等等，因此译本一出现在米兰，就被教会搜去全部销毁，在丹麦和德国的一些邦，也被宣布为禁书。但尽管如此，仍阻止不了《维特》的流传。它很快译成了各种语言文字，在英、法两国译本分别多达十数种，仿效之作也大量出现。

德国人模仿我，法国人读我入迷，

英国啊，你殷勤接待我这个

憔悴的客人；

可于我又有何益哟，中国人

也用颤抖的手，把维特和绿蒂

画上了镜屏！

歌德这节诗，说的就是他对《维特》的广为流传所感到的矛盾心情。关于中国古瓷上出现维特与绿蒂画像的说法有好几起，较为可信的要数德国汉学家卫礼贤（Richard Wilhelm）在《歌德与中国文化》一文中所提到的。他写道：“………在广州地方，特别为外国人预备瓷器，所谓客货的那类东西，上面的画图是照欧洲人的嗜好绘的，所以画上维特与绿蒂等人的像。”但不管这类传说是否可信，千真万确的却是在《维特》问世后一个半世纪的1922年，我国出版了郭沫若译的《少年维特之烦恼》，同样引起了巨大的反响。当时正处于反封建斗争中的一代中国青年，在《维特》中找到了知音。仅据1932年的一个不完全统计，十年间郭译《维特》已由不同书店重印了三十版之多。最近一些年，各种新译也层出不穷，包括1981年率先推出的拙译在内，各个时期的译本加在一起，数量更多达30种左右。以一部外国文学作品在中国产生影响之大和重译、重版次数之多论，《维特》恐怕是无与伦比的。

《维特》为什么能产生如此巨大的影响？

起决定作用的，首先应该是《维特》所具有的反封建的时代精神，也即上文已经指出过的，它表现了一个时代的烦恼、憧憬以及苦闷。关于这一点，歌德在其自传《诗与真》中说得十分明白：“这本小册子的影响很大，甚至可以说轰动一时，主要就因为它恰在适当的时候出版的缘故。正如只需一点火药线就可引起一个地雷爆炸似的，当时青年的身上已埋藏有厌世的炸药，所以这本小册子在读者群众中引起的爆炸分外猛烈………”。

等到欧洲进入十九世纪四十年代的革命高潮时期，《维特》便不再时兴了。于是海涅在 1842年写的《倾向》一诗中劝诗人“别再像维特那样呻吟，因为他的心只为绿蒂燃烧”。匈牙利革命诗人裴多菲更把《维特》贬得无以复加，干脆称维特是一个“没有骨气的傻瓜”。因为当时的青年不再是哭哭啼啼的厌世者，他们已成了举起剑与火焰来进行斗争的战士。

同样，《维特》在我国广为流传，也主要因为我国“五四”运动时期，与一个半世纪前的德国“狂飙突进”时期有不少类似之处。反对封建压迫、追求个性解放乃是不可阻遏的时代潮流。

其次，必须强调，艺术上的成功也是使《维特》产生巨大影响的重要原因。

歌德恰当地使用了第一人称的书信体，取得了突出的艺术效果。近百封长短书简组成了一个有机整体，前后加上“编者”的引言和按语，读起来使人感到真切可信。信里时而写景，时而抒情，时而叙事，时而议论，读着读着，我们仿佛就变成了收信人，听见了主人公的言谈笑语，啼泣悲叹。

郭沫若在《维特》译本序引中赞它是一篇散文诗。《维特》的确像抒情诗一样以情动人。小说情节并不复杂，但却扣人心弦，引人入胜。作者常常让主人公直抒胸臆，如维特那封在生命的最后两天断断续续写成的绝命书，真是有声有泪，哀婉凄绝。此外他还巧妙地用自然景物烘托情感，用荷马和莪相的诗句或诗中的意境渲染气氛。

“春风呵，你为何将我唤醒？………可是啊，我的衰时近了，风暴即将袭来，吹打得我枝叶飘零！明天，有位旅人将要到来，他见过我的美好青春；他的眼儿将在旷野里四处寻觅，却不见我的踪影……”莪相的这几句哀歌，由即将离开人世的维特念出来，不正成了他自己的凄凉心境与悲惨命运的真切写照了吗？在《维特》中，类似这样能给人以诗的回味的段落，不胜枚举。

再有，小说的人物塑造也很出色。特别是青衣黄裤的翩翩少年维特，已成了世界文学中的著名典型，即那么一种“伟大而又渺小，可爱而又可鄙的怪人”（莱辛语）。

总的来说，强烈的时代精神加上卓越的艺术手法，赋予《维特》以爆炸似的震撼人心的力量，使它在世界各国千千万万的青年读者心中，引起了强烈的共鸣与回响。

从1772年《维特》问世到今天已经过去近两个半世纪。时代完全变了，世界完全变了，今天我们再来阅读、欣赏经典名著，当然也会以完全不同于一百年前的先辈的态度和眼光。作为本书的译者，我希望今日的读者特别是年轻的朋友们，不但能从中了解、认识主人公维特生活的十八世纪的德国社会，也能受到文学的陶冶，获得阅读杰作的巨大愉悦。

PREFACE


I have carefully collected whatever I have been able to learn of the story of poor Werther, and here present it to you, knowing that you will thank me for it. To his spirit and character you cannot refuse your admiration and love: to his fate you will not deny your tears.

And thou, good soul, who sufferest the same distress as he endured once, draw comfort from his sorrows; and let this little book be thy friend, if, owing to fortune or through thine own fault, thou canst not find a dearer companion.





BOOK I


MAY 4, 1771


How happy I am that I am gone! My dear friend, what a thing is the heart of man! To leave you, from whom I have been inseparable, whom I love so dearly, and yet to feel happy! I know you will forgive me. Have not other attachments been specially appointed by fate to torment a head like mine? Poor Leonora! and yet I was not to blame. Was it my fault, that, whilst the peculiar charms of her sister afforded me an agreeable entertainment, a passion for me was engendered in her feeble heart? And yet am I wholly blameless? Did I not encourage her emotions? Did I not feel charmed at those truly genuine expressions of nature, which, though but little mirthful in reality, so often amused us? Did I not—but oh! what is man, that he dares so to accuse himself? My dear friend I promise you I will improve; I will no longer, as has ever been my habit, continue to ruminate on every petty vexation which fortune may dispense; I will enjoy the present, and the past shall be for me the past. No doubt you are right, my best of friends, there would be far less suffering amongst mankind, if men—and God knows why they are so fashioned—did not employ their imaginations so assiduously in recalling the memory of past sorrow, instead of bearing their present lot with equanimity.

Be kind enough to inform my mother that I shall attend to her business to the best of my ability, and shall give her the earliest information about it. I have seen my aunt, and find that she is very far from being the disagreeable person our friends allege her to be. She is a lively, cheerful woman, with the best of hearts. I explained to her my mother’s wrongs with regard to that part of her portion which has been withheld from her. She told me the motives and reasons of her own conduct, and the terms on which she is willing to give up the whole, and to do more than we have asked. In short, I cannot write further upon this subject at present; only assure my mother that all will go on well. And I have again observed, my dear friend, in this trifling affair, that misunderstandings and neglect occasion more mischief in the world than even malice and wickedness. At all events, the two latter are of less frequent occurrence.

In other respects I am very well off here. Solitude in this terrestrial paradise is a genial balm to my mind, and the young spring cheers with its bounteous promises my oftentimes misgiving heart. Every tree, every bush, is full of flowers; and one might wish himself transformed into a butterfly, to float about in this ocean of perfume, and find his whole existence in it.

The town itself is disagreeable; but then, all around, you find an inexpressible beauty of nature. This induced the late Count M to lay out a garden on one of the sloping hills which here intersect each other with the most charming variety, and form the most lovely valleys. The garden is simple; and it is easy to perceive, even upon your first entrance, that the plan was not designed by a scientific gardener, but by a man who wished to give himself up here to the enjoyment of his own sensitive heart. Many a tear have I already shed to the memory of its departed master in a summerhouse which is now reduced to ruins, but was his favourite resort, and now is mine. I shall soon be master of the place. The gardener has become attached to me within the last few days, and he will lose nothing thereby.





MAY 10.


A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now. When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath of that universal love which bears and sustains us, as it floats around us in an eternity of bliss; and then, my friend, when darkness overspreads my eyes, and heaven and earth seem to dwell in my soul and absorb its power, like the form of a beloved mistress, then I often think with longing, oh, would I could describe these conceptions, could impress upon paper all that is living so full and warm within me, that it might be the mirror of my soul, as my soul is the mirror of the infinite God! O my friend—but it is too much for my strength—I sink under the weight of the splendour of these visions!





MAY 12.


I know not whether some deceitful spirits haunt this spot, or whether it be the warm, celestial fancy in my own heart which makes everything around me seem like paradise. In front of the house is a fountain,—a fountain to which I am bound by a charm like Melusina and her sisters. Descending a gentle slope, you come to an arch, where, some twenty steps lower down, water of the clearest crystal gushes from the marble rock. The narrow wall which encloses it above, the tall trees which encircle the spot, and the coolness of the place itself,—everything imparts a pleasant but sublime impression. Not a day passes on which I do not spend an hour there. The young maidens come from the town to fetch water,—innocent and necessary employment, and formerly the occupation of the daughters of kings. As I take my rest there, the idea of the old patriarchal life is awakened around me. I see them, our old ancestors, how they formed their friendships and contracted alliances at the fountain-side; and I feel how fountains and streams were guarded by beneficent spirits. He who is a stranger to these sensations has never really enjoyed cool repose at the side of a fountain after the fatigue of a weary summer day.





MAY 13.


You ask if you shall send me books. My dear friend, I beseech you, for the love of God, relieve me from such a yoke! I need no more to be guided, agitated, heated. My heart ferments sufficiently of itself. I want strains to lull me, and I find them to perfection in my Homer. Often do I strive to allay the burning fever of my blood; and you have never witnessed anything so unsteady, so uncertain, as my heart. But need I confess this to you, my dear friend, who have so often endured the anguish of witnessing my sudden transitions from sorrow to immoderate joy, and from sweet melancholy to violent passions? I treat my poor heart like a sick child, and gratify its every fancy. Do not mention this again: there are people who would censure me for it.





MAY 15.


The common people of the place know me already, and love me, particularly the children. When at first I associated with them, and inquired in a friendly tone about their various trifles, some fancied that I wished to ridicule them, and turned from me in exceeding ill-humour. I did not allow that circumstance to grieve me: I only felt most keenly what I have often before observed. Persons who can claim a certain rank keep themselves coldly aloof from the common people, as though they feared to lose their importance by the contact; whilst wanton idlers, and such as are prone to bad joking, affect to descend to their level, only to make the poor people feel their impertinence all the more keenly.

I know very well that we are not all equal, nor can be so; but it is my opinion that he who avoids the common people, in order not to lose their respect, is as much to blame as a coward who hides himself from his enemy because he fears defeat.

The other day I went to the fountain, and found a young servant-girl, who had set her pitcher on the lowest step, and looked around to see if one of her companions was approaching to place it on her head. I ran down, and looked at her. “Shall I help you, pretty lass?” said I. She blushed deeply. “Oh, sir!” she exclaimed. “No ceremony!” I replied. She adjusted her head-gear, and I helped her. She thanked me, and ascended the steps.





MAY 17.


I have made all sorts of acquaintances, but have as yet found no society. I know not what attraction I possess for the people, so many of them like me, and attach themselves to me; and then I feel sorry when the road we pursue together goes only a short distance. If you inquire what the people are like here, I must answer, “The same as everywhere.” The human race is but a monotonous affair. Most of them labour the greater part of their time for mere subsistence; and the scanty portion of freedom which remains to them so troubles them that they use every exertion to get rid of it. Oh, the destiny of man!

But they are a right good sort of people. If I occasionally forget myself, and take part in the innocent pleasures which are not yet forbidden to the peasantry, and enjoy myself, for instance, with genuine freedom and sincerity, round a well-covered table, or arrange an excursion or a dance opportunely, and so forth, all this produces a good effect upon my disposition; only I must forget that there lie dormant within me so many other qualities which moulder uselessly, and which I am obliged to keep carefully concealed. Ah! this thought affects my spirits fearfully. And yet to be misunderstood is the fate of the like of us.

Alas, that the friend of my youth is gone! Alas, that I ever knew her! I might say to myself, “You are a dreamer to seek what is not to be found here below.” But she has been mine. I have possessed that heart, that noble soul, in whose presence I seemed to be more than I really was, because I was all that I could be. Good heavens! did then a single power of my soul remain unexercised? In her presence could I not display, to its full extent, that mysterious feeling with which my heart embraces nature? Was not our intercourse a perpetual web of the finest emotions, of the keenest wit, the varieties of which, even in their very eccentricity, bore the stamp of genius? Alas! the few years by which she was my senior brought her to the grave before me. Never can I forget her firm mind or her heavenly patience.

A few days ago I met a certain young V—, a frank, open fellow, with a most pleasing countenance. He has just left the university, does not deem himself overwise, but believes he knows more than other people. He has worked hard, as I can perceive from many circumstances, and, in short, possesses a large stock of information. When he heard that I am drawing a good deal, and that I know Greek (two wonderful things for this part of the country), he came to see me, and displayed his whole store of learning, from Batteaux to Wood, from De Piles to Winkelmann: he assured me he had read through the first part of Sultzer’s theory, and also possessed a manuscript of Heyne’s work on the study of the antique. I allowed it all to pass.

I have become acquainted, also, with a very worthy person, the district judge, a frank and open-hearted man. I am told it is a most delightful thing to see him in the midst of his children, of whom he has nine. His eldest daughter especially is highly spoken of. He has invited me to go and see him, and I intend to do so on the first opportunity. He lives at one of the royal hunting-lodges, which can be reached from here in an hour and a half by walking, and which he obtained leave to inhabit after the loss of his wife, as it is so painful to him to reside in town and at the court.

There have also come in my way a few other originals of a questionable sort, who are in all respects undesirable, and most intolerable in their demonstration of friendship. Good-bye. This letter will please you: it is quite historical.





MAY 22.


That the life of man is but a dream, many a man has surmised heretofore; and I, too, am everywhere pursued by this feeling. When I consider the narrow limits within which our active and inquiring faculties are confined; when I see how all our energies are wasted in providing for mere necessities, which again have no further end than to prolong a wretched existence; and then that all our satisfaction concerning certain subjects of investigation ends in nothing better than a passive resignation, whilst we amuse ourselves painting our prison-walls with bright figures and brilliant landscapes,—when I consider all this, Wilhelm, I am silent. I examine my own being, and find there a world, but a world rather of imagination and dim desires, than of distinctness and living power. Then everything swims before my senses, and I smile and dream while pursuing my way through the world.

All learned professors and doctors are agreed that children do not comprehend the cause of their desires; but that the grown-up should wander about this earth like children, without knowing whence they come, or whither they go, influenced as little by fixed motives, but guided like them by biscuits, sugar-plums, and the rod,—this is what nobody is willing to acknowledge; and yet I think it is palpable.

I know what you will say in reply; for I am ready to admit that they are happiest, who, like children, amuse themselves with their playthings, dress and undress their dolls, and attentively watch the cupboard, where mamma has locked up her sweet things, and, when at last they get a delicious morsel, eat it greedily, and exclaim, “More!” These are certainly happy beings; but others also are objects of envy, who dignify their paltry employments, and sometimes even their passions, with pompous titles, representing them to mankind as gigantic achievements performed for their welfare and glory. But the man who humbly acknowledges the vanity of all this, who observes with what pleasure the thriving citizen converts his little garden into a paradise, and how patiently even the poor man pursues his weary way under his burden, and how all wish equally to behold the light of the sun a little longer,—yes, such a man is at peace, and creates his own world within himself; and he is also happy, because he is a man. And then, however limited his sphere, he still preserves in his bosom the sweet feeling of liberty, and knows that he can quit his prison whenever he likes.





MAY 26.


You know of old my ways of settling anywhere, of selecting a little cottage in some cosy spot, and of putting up in it with every inconvenience. Here, too, I have discovered such a snug, comfortable place, which possesses peculiar charms for me.

About a league from the town is a place called Walheim. (The reader need not take the trouble to look for the place thus designated. We have found it necessary to change the names given in the original.) It is delightfully situated on the side of a hill; and, by proceeding along one of the footpaths which lead out of the village, you can have a view of the whole valley. A good old woman lives there, who keeps a small inn. She sells wine, beer, and coffee, and is cheerful and pleasant notwithstanding her age. The chief charm of this spot consists in two linden-trees, spreading their enormous branches over the little green before the church, which is entirely surrounded by peasants’ cottages, barns, and homesteads. I have seldom seen a place so retired and peaceable; and there often have my table and chair brought out from the little inn, and drink my coffee there, and read my Homer.

Accident brought me to the spot one fine afternoon, and I found it perfectly deserted. Everybody was in the fields except a little boy about four years of age, who was sitting on the ground, and held between his knees a child about six months old: he pressed it to his bosom with both arms, which thus formed a sort of arm-chair; and, notwithstanding the liveliness which sparkled in its black eyes, it remained perfectly still. The sight charmed me. I sat down upon a plough opposite, and sketched with great delight this little picture of brotherly tenderness. I added the neighbouring hedge, the barn-door, and some broken cart-wheels, just as they happened to lie; and I found in about an hour that I had made a very correct and interesting drawing, without putting in the slightest thing of my own. This confirmed me in my resolution of adhering, for the future, entirely to nature. She alone is inexhaustible, and capable of forming the greatest masters. Much may be alleged in favour of rules, as much may be likewise advanced in favour of the laws of society: an artist formed upon them will never produce anything absolutely bad or disgusting; as a man who observes the laws, and obeys decorum, can never be an absolutely intolerable neighbour, nor a decided villain: but yet, say what you will of rules, they destroy the genuine feeling of nature, as well as its true expression. Do not tell me “that this is too hard, that they only restrain and prune superfluous branches, etc.” My good friend, I will illustrate this by an analogy. These things resemble love. A warmhearted youth becomes strongly attached to a maiden: he spends every hour of the day in her company, wears out his health, and lavishes his fortune, to afford continual proof that he is wholly devoted to her. Then comes a man of the world, a man of place and respectability, and addresses him thus: “My good young friend, love is natural; but you must love within bounds. Divide your time: devote a portion to business, and give the hours of recreation to your mistress. Calculate your fortune; and out of the superfluity you may make her a present, only not too often,—on her birthday, and such occasions.” Pursuing this advice, he may become a useful member of society, and I should advise every prince to give him an appointment; but it is all up with his love, and with his genius if he be an artist. O my friend! why is it that the torrent of genius so seldom bursts forth, so seldom rolls in full-flowing stream, overwhelming your astounded soul? Because, on either side of this stream, cold and respectable persons have taken up their abodes, and, forsooth, their summer-houses and tulip-beds would suffer from the torrent; wherefore they dig trenches, and raise embankments betimes, in order to avert the impending danger.





MAY 27.


I find I have fallen into raptures, declamation, and similes, and have forgotten, in consequence, to tell you what became of the children. Absorbed in my artistic contemplations, which I briefly described in my letter of yesterday, I continued sitting on the plough for two hours. Toward evening a young woman, with a basket on her arm, came running toward the children, who had not moved all that time. She exclaimed from a distance, “You are a good boy, Philip!” She gave me greeting: I returned it, rose, and approached her. I inquired if she were the mother of those pretty children. “Yes,” she said; and, giving the eldest a piece of bread, she took the little one in her arms and kissed it with a mother’s tenderness. “I left my child in Philip’s care,” she said, “whilst I went into the town with my eldest boy to buy some wheaten bread, some sugar, and an earthen pot.” I saw the various articles in the basket, from which the cover had fallen. “I shall make some broth tonight for my little Hans (which was the name of the youngest): that wild fellow, the big one, broke my pot yesterday, whilst he was scrambling with Philip for what remained of the contents.” I inquired for the eldest; and she bad scarcely time to tell me that he was driving a couple of geese home from the meadow, when he ran up, and handed Philip an osier-twig. I talked a little longer with the woman, and found that she was the daughter of the schoolmaster, and that her husband was gone on a journey into Switzerland for some money a relation had left him. “They wanted to cheat him,” she said, “and would not answer his letters; so he is gone there himself. I hope he has met with no accident, as I have heard nothing of him since his departure.” I left the woman, with regret, giving each of the children a kreutzer, with an additional one for the youngest, to buy some wheaten bread for his broth when she went to town next; and so we parted.

I assure you, my dear friend, when my thoughts are all in tumult, the sight of such a creature as this tranquillizes my disturbed mind. She moves in a happy thoughtlessness within the confined circle of her existence; she supplies her wants from day to day; and, when she sees the leaves fall, they raise no other idea in her mind than that winter is approaching. Since that time I have gone out there frequently. The children have become quite familiar with me; and each gets a lump of sugar when I drink my coffee, and they share my milk and bread and butter in the evening. They always receive their kreutzer on Sundays, for the good woman has orders to give it to them when I do not go there after evening service. They are quite at home with me, tell me everything; and I am particularly amused with observing their tempers, and the simplicity of their behaviour, when some of the other village children are assembled with them.

It has given me a deal of trouble to satisfy the anxiety of the mother, lest (as she says) “they should inconvenience the gentleman.”





MAY 30.


What I have lately said of painting is equally true with respect to poetry. It is only necessary for us to know what is really excellent, and venture to give it expression; and that is saying much in few words. Today I have had a scene, which, if literally related, would, make the most beautiful idyl in the world. But why should I talk of poetry and scenes and idyls? Can we never take pleasure in nature without having recourse to art?

If you expect anything grand or magnificent from this introduction, you will be sadly mistaken. It relates merely to a peasant-lad, who has excited in me the warmest interest. As usual, I shall tell my story badly; and you, as usual, will think me extravagant. It is Walheim once more— always Walheim—which produces these wonderful phenomena.

A party had assembled outside the house under the linden-trees, to drink coffee. The company did not exactly please me; and, under one pretext or another, I lingered behind.

A peasant came from an adjoining house, and set to work arranging some part of the same plough which I had lately sketched. His appearance pleased me; and I spoke to him, inquired about his circumstances, made his acquaintance, and, as is my wont with persons of that class, was soon admitted into his confidence. He said he was in the service of a young widow, who set great store by him. He spoke so much of his mistress, and praised her so extravagantly, that I could soon see he was desperately in love with her. “She is no longer young,” he said: “and she was treated so badly by her former husband that she does not mean to marry again.” From his account it was so evident what incomparable charms she possessed for him, and how ardently he wished she would select him to extinguish the recollection of her first husband’s misconduct, that I should have to repeat his own words in order to describe the depth of the poor fellow’s attachment, truth, and devotion. It would, in fact, require the gifts of a great poet to convey the expression of his features, the harmony of his voice, and the heavenly fire of his eye. No words can portray the tenderness of his every movement and of every feature: no effort of mine could do justice to the scene. His alarm lest I should misconceive his position with regard to his mistress, or question the propriety of her conduct, touched me particularly. The charming manner with which he described her form and person, which, without possessing the graces of youth, won and attached him to her, is inexpressible, and must be left to the imagination. I have never in my life witnessed or fancied or conceived the possibility of such intense devotion, such ardent affections, united with so much purity. Do not blame me if I say that the recollection of this innocence and truth is deeply impressed upon my very soul; that this picture of fidelity and tenderness haunts me everywhere; and that my own heart, as though enkindled by the flame, glows and burns within me.

I mean now to try and see her as soon as I can: or perhaps, on second thoughts, I had better not; it is better I should behold her through the eyes of her lover. To my sight, perhaps, she would not appear as she now stands before me; and why should I destroy so sweet a picture?





JUNE 16.


“Why do I not write to you?” You lay claim to learning, and ask such a question. You should have guessed that I am well—that is to say—in a word, I have made an acquaintance who has won my heart: I have—I know not.

To give you a regular account of the manner in which I have become acquainted with the most amiable of women would be a difficult task. I am a happy and contented mortal, but a poor historian.

An angel! Nonsense! Everybody so describes his mistress; and yet I find it impossible to tell you how perfect she is, or why she is so perfect: suffice it to say she has captivated all my senses.

So much simplicity with so much understanding—so mild, and yet so resolute—a mind so placid, and a life so active.

But all this is ugly balderdash, which expresses not a single character nor feature. Some other time—but no, not some other time, now, this very instant, will I tell you all about it. Now or never. Well, between ourselves, since I commenced my letter, I have been three times on the point of throwing down my pen, of ordering my horse, and riding out. And yet I vowed this morning that I would not ride today, and yet every moment I am rushing to the window to see how high the sun is.

I could not restrain myself—go to her I must. I have just returned, Wilhelm; and whilst I am taking supper I will write to you. What a delight it was for my soul to see her in the midst of her dear, beautiful children,— eight brothers and sisters!

But, if I proceed thus, you will be no wiser at the end of my letter than you were at the beginning. Attend, then, and I will compel myself to give you the details.

I mentioned to you the other day that I had become acquainted with S—, the district judge, and that he had invited me to go and visit him in his retirement, or rather in his little kingdom. But I neglected going, and perhaps should never have gone, if chance had not discovered to me the treasure which lay concealed in that retired spot. Some of our young people had proposed giving a ball in the country, at which I consented to be present. I offered my hand for the evening to a pretty and agreeable, but rather commonplace, sort of girl from the immediate neighbourhood; and it was agreed that I should engage a carriage, and call upon Lotte, with my partner and her aunt, to convey them to the ball. My companion informed me, as we drove along through the park to the hunting-lodge, that I should make the acquaintance of a very charming young lady. “Take care,” added the aunt, “that you do not lose your heart.” “Why?” said I. “Because she is already engaged to a very worthy man,” she replied, “who is gone to settle his affairs upon the death of his father, and will succeed to a very considerable inheritance.” This information possessed no interest for me. When we arrived at the gate, the sun was setting behind the tops of the mountains. The atmosphere was heavy; and the ladies expressed their fears of an approaching storm, as masses of low black clouds were gathering in the horizon. I relieved their anxieties by pretending to be weather-wise, although I myself had some apprehensions lest our pleasure should be interrupted.

I alighted; and a maid came to the door, and requested us to wait a moment for her mistress. I walked across the court to a well-built house, and, ascending the flight of steps in front, opened the door, and saw before me the most charming spectacle I had ever witnessed. Six children, from eleven to two years old, were running about the hall, and surrounding a lady of middle height, with a lovely figure, dressed in a robe of simple white, trimmed with pink ribbons. She was holding a rye loaf in her hand, and was cutting slices for the little ones all around, in proportion to their age and appetite. She performed her task in a graceful and affectionate manner; each claimant awaiting his turn with outstretched hands, and boisterously shouting his thanks. Some of them ran away at once, to enjoy their evening meal; whilst others, of a gentler disposition, retired to the courtyard to see the strangers, and to survey the carriage in which their Lotte was to drive away. “Pray forgive me for giving you the trouble to come for me, and for keeping the ladies waiting: but dressing, and arranging some household duties before I leave, had made me forget my children’s supper; and they do not like to take it from any one but me.” I uttered some indifferent compliment: but my whole soul was absorbed by her air, her voice, her manner; and I had scarcely recovered myself when she ran into her room to fetch her gloves and fan. The young ones threw inquiring glances at me from a distance; whilst I approached the youngest, a most delicious little creature. He drew back; and Lotte, entering at the very moment, said, “Louis, shake hands with your cousin.” The little fellow obeyed willingly; and I could not resist giving him a hearty kiss, notwithstanding his rather dirty face. “Cousin,” said I to Lotte, as I handed her down, “do you think I deserve the happiness of being related to you?” She replied, with a ready smile, “Oh! I have such a number of cousins, that I should be sorry if you were the most undeserving of them.” In taking leave, she desired her next sister, Sophy, a girl about eleven years old, to take great care of the children, and to say good-bye to papa for her when he came home from his ride. She enjoined to the little ones to obey their sister Sophy as they would herself, upon which some promised that they would; but a little fair-haired girl, about six years old, looked discontented, and said, “But Sophy is not you, Lotte; and we like you best.” The two eldest boys had clambered up the carriage; and, at my request, she permitted them to accompany us a little way through the forest, upon their promising to sit very still, and hold fast.

We were hardly seated, and the ladies had scarcely exchanged compliments, making the usual remarks upon each other’s dress, and upon the company they expected to meet, when Lotte stopped the carriage, and made her brothers get down. They insisted upon kissing her hands once more; which the eldest did with all the tenderness of a youth of fifteen, but the other in a lighter and more careless manner. She desired them again to give her love to the children, and we drove off.

The aunt inquired of Lotte whether she had finished the book she had last sent her. “No,” said Lotte; “I did not like it: you can have it again. And the one before was not much better.” I was surprised, upon asking the title, to hear that it was—. (We feel obliged to suppress the passage in the letter, to prevent any one from feeling aggrieved; although no author need pay much attention to the opinion of a mere girl, or that of an unsteady young man.)

I found penetration and character in everything she said: every expression seemed to brighten her features with new charms,—with new rays of genius,—which unfolded by degrees, as she felt herself understood.

“When I was younger,” she observed, “I loved nothing so much as romances. Nothing could equal my delight when, on some holiday, I could settle down quietly in a corner, and enter with my whole heart and soul into the joys or sorrows of some fictitious Leonora. I do not deny that they even possess some charms for me yet. But I read so seldom, that I prefer books suited exactly to my taste. And I like those authors best whose scenes describe my own situation in life,—and the friends who are about me, whose stories touch me with interest, from resembling my own homely existence,—which, without being absolutely paradise, is, on the whole, a source of indescribable happiness.”

I endeavoured to conceal the emotion which these words occasioned, but it was of slight avail; for, when she had expressed so truly her opinion of The Vicar of Wakefield, and of other works, the names of which I omit (Though the names are omitted, yet the authors mentioned deserve Lotte’s approbation, and will feel it in their hearts when they read this passage. It concerns no other person.), I could no longer contain myself, but gave full utterance to what I thought of it: and it was not until Lotte had addressed herself to the two other ladies, that I remembered their presence, and observed them sitting mute with astonishment. The aunt looked at me several times with an air of raillery, which, however, I did not at all mind.

We talked of the pleasures of dancing. “If it is a fault to love it,” said Lotte, “I am ready to confess that I prize it above all other amusements. If anything disturbs me, I go to the piano, play an air to which I have danced, and all goes right again directly.”

You, who know me, can fancy how steadfastly I gazed upon her rich dark eyes during these remarks, how my very soul gloated over her warm lips and fresh, glowing cheeks, how I became quite lost in the delightful meaning of her words, so much so, that I scarcely heard the actual expressions. In short, I alighted from the carriage like a person in a dream, and was so lost to the dim world around me, that I scarcely heard the music which resounded from the illuminated ballroom.

The two Messrs. Andran and a certain N. N. (I cannot trouble myself with the names), who were the aunt’s and Lotte’s partners, received us at the carriage-door, and took possession of their ladies, whilst I followed with mine.

We commenced with a minuet. I led out one lady after another, and precisely those who were the most disagreeable could not bring themselves to leave off. Lotte and her partner began an English country dance, and you must imagine my delight when it was their turn to dance the figure with us. You should see Lotte dance. She dances with her whole heart and soul: her figure is all harmony, elegance, and grace, as if she were conscious of nothing else, and had no other thought or feeling; and, doubtless, for the moment, every other sensation is extinct.

She was engaged for the second country dance, but promised me the third, and assured me, with the most agreeable freedom, that she was very fond of waltzing. “It is the custom here,” she said, “for the previous partners to waltz together; but my partner is an indifferent waltzer, and will feel delighted if I save him the trouble. Your partner is not allowed to waltz, and, indeed, is equally incapable: but I observed during the country dance that you waltz well; so, if you will waltz with me, I beg you would propose it to my partner, and I will propose it to yours.” We agreed, and it was arranged that our partners should mutually entertain each other.

We set off, and, at first, delighted ourselves with the usual graceful motions of the arms. With what grace, with what ease, she moved! When the waltz commenced, and the dancers whirled around each other in the giddy maze, there was some confusion, owing to the incapacity of some of the dancers. We judiciously remained still, allowing the others to weary themselves; and, when the awkward dancers had withdrawn, we joined in, and kept it up famously together with one other couple,—Andran and his partner. Never did I dance more lightly. I felt myself more than mortal, holding this loveliest of creatures in my arms, flying, with her as rapidly as the wind, till I lost sight of every other object; and O Wilhelm, I vowed at that moment, that a maiden whom I loved, or for whom I felt the slightest attachment, never, never should waltz with any one else but with me, if I went to perdition for it!—you will understand this.

We took a few turns in the room to recover our breath. Lotte sat down, and felt refreshed by partaking of some oranges which I had had secured,—the only ones that had been left; but at every slice which, from politeness, she offered to her neighbours, I felt as though a dagger went through my heart.

We were the second couple in the third country dance. As we were going down (and Heaven knows with what ecstasy I gazed at her arms and eyes, beaming with the sweetest feeling of pure and genuine enjoyment), we passed a lady whom I had noticed for her charming expression of countenance; although she was no longer young. She looked at Lotte with a smile, then, holding up her finger in a threatening attitude, repeated twice in a very significant tone of voice the name of “Albert.”

“Who is Albert,” said I to Lotte, “if it is not impertinent to ask?” She was about to answer, when we were obliged to separate, in order to execute a figure in the dance; and, as we crossed over again in front of each other, I perceived she looked somewhat pensive. “Why need I conceal it from you?” she said, as she gave me her hand for the promenade. “Albert is a worthy man, to whom I am engaged.” Now, there was nothing new to me in this (for the girls had told me of it on the way); but it was so far new that I had not thought of it in connection with her whom, in so short a time, I had learned to prize so highly. Enough, I became confused, got out in the figure, and occasioned general confusion; so that it required all Lotte’s presence of mind to set me right by pulling and pushing me into my proper place.

The dance was not yet finished when the lightning which had for some time been seen in the horizon, and which I had asserted to proceed entirely from heat, grew more violent; and the thunder was heard above the music. When any distress or terror surprises us in the midst of our amusements, it naturally makes a deeper impression than at other times, either because the contrast makes us more keenly susceptible, or rather perhaps because our senses are then more open to impressions, and the shock is consequently stronger. To this cause I must ascribe the fright and shrieks of the ladies. One sagaciously sat down in a corner with her back to the window, and held her fingers to her ears; a second knelt down before her, and hid her face in her lap; a third threw herself between them, and embraced her sister with a thousand tears; some insisted on going home; others, unconscious of their actions, wanted sufficient presence of mind to repress the impertinence of their young partners, who sought to direct to themselves those sighs which the lips of our agitated beauties intended for heaven. Some of the gentlemen had gone down-stairs to smoke a quiet cigar, and the rest of the company gladly embraced a happy suggestion of the hostess to retire into another room which was provided with shutters and curtains. We had hardly got there, when Lotte placed the chairs in a circle; and, when the company had sat down in compliance with her request, she forthwith proposed a round game.

I noticed some of the company prepare their mouths and draw themselves up at the prospect of some agreeable forfeit. “Let us play at counting,” said Lotte. “Now, pay attention: I shall go round the circle from right to left; and each person is to count, one after the other, the number that comes to him, and must count fast; whoever stops or mistakes is to have a box on the ear, and so on, till we have counted a thousand.” It was delightful to see the fun. She went round the circle with upraised arm. “One,” said the first; “two,” the second; “three,” the third; and so on, till Lotte went faster and faster. One made a mistake, instantly a box on the ear; and, amid the laughter that ensued, came another box; and so on, faster and faster. I myself came in for two. I fancied they were harder than the rest, and felt quite delighted. A general laughter and confusion put an end to the game long before we had counted as far as a thousand. The party broke up into little separate knots: the storm had ceased, and I followed Lotte into the ballroom. On the way she said, “The game banished their fears of the storm.” I could make no reply. “I myself,” she continued, “was as much frightened as any of them; but by affecting courage, to keep up the spirits of the others, I forgot my apprehensions.” We went to the window. It was still thundering at a distance: a soft rain was pouring down over the country, and filled the air around us with delicious odours. Lotte leaned forward on her arm; her eyes wandered over the scene; she raised them to the sky, and then turned them upon me; they were moistened with tears; she placed her hand on mine and said, “Klopstock!” at once I remembered the magnificent ode which was in her thoughts: I felt oppressed with the weight of my sensations, and sank under them. It was more than I could bear. I bent over her hand, kissed it in a stream of delicious tears, and again looked up to her eyes. Divine Klopstock! why didst thou not see thy apotheosis in those eyes? And thy name so often profaned, would that I never heard it repeated!





JUNE 19.


I no longer remember where I stopped in my narrative: I only know it was two in the morning when I went to bed; and if you had been with me, that I might have talked instead of writing to you, I should, in all probability, have kept you up till daylight.

I think I have not yet related what happened as we rode home from the ball, nor have I time to tell you now. It was a most magnificent sunrise: the whole country was refreshed, and the rain fell drop by drop from the trees in the forest. Our companions were asleep. Lotte asked me if I did not wish to sleep also, and begged of me not to make any ceremony on her account. Looking steadfastly at her, I answered, “As long as I see those eyes open, there is no fear of my falling asleep.” We both continued awake till we reached her door. The maid opened it softly, and assured her, in answer to her inquiries, that her father and the children were well, and still sleeping. I left her asking permission to visit her in the course of the day. She consented, and I went, and, since that time, sun, moon, and stars may pursue their course: I know not whether it is day or night; the whole world is nothing to me.





JUNE 21.


My days are as happy as those reserved by God for his elect; and, whatever be my fate hereafter, I can never say that I have not tasted joy,— the purest joy of life. You know Walheim. I am now completely settled there. In that spot I am only half a league from Lotte; and there I enjoy myself, and taste all the pleasure which can fall to the lot of man.

Little did I imagine, when I selected Walheim for my pedestrian excursions, that all heaven lay so near it. How often in my wanderings from the hillside or from the meadows across the river, have I beheld this hunting-lodge, which now contains within it all the joy of my heart!

I have often, my dear Wilhelm, reflected on the eagerness men feel to wander and make new discoveries, and upon that secret impulse which afterward inclines them to return to their narrow circle, conform to the laws of custom, and embarrass themselves no longer with what passes around them.

It is so strange how, when I came here first, and gazed upon that lovely valley from the hillside, I felt charmed with the entire scene surrounding me. The little wood opposite—how delightful to sit under its shade! How fine the view from that point of rock! Then, that delightful chain of hills, and the exquisite valleys at their feet! Could I but wander and lose myself amongst them! I went, and returned without finding what I wished. Distance, my friend, is like futurity. A dim vastness is spread before our souls: the perceptions of our mind are as obscure as those of our vision; and we desire earnestly to surrender up our whole being, that it may be filled with the complete and perfect bliss of one glorious emotion. But alas! when we have attained our object, when the distant there becomes the present here, all is changed: we are as poor and circumscribed as ever, and our souls still languish for unattainable happiness.

So does the restless traveller pant for his native soil, and find in his own cottage, in the arms of his wife, in the affections of his children, and in the labour necessary for their support, that happiness which he had sought in vain through the wide world.

When, in the morning at sunrise, I go out to Walheim, and with my own hands gather in the garden the pease which are to serve for my dinner, when I sit down to shell them, and read my Homer during the intervals, and then, selecting a saucepan from the kitchen, fetch my own butter, put my mess on the fire, cover it up, and sit down to stir it as occasion requires, I figure to myself the illustrious suitors of Penelope, killing, dressing, and preparing their own oxen and swine. Nothing fills me with a more pure and genuine sense of happiness than those traits of patriarchal life which, thank Heaven! I can imitate without affectation. Happy is it, indeed, for me that my heart is capable of feeling the same simple and innocent pleasure as the peasant whose table is covered with food of his own rearing, and who not only enjoys his meal, but remembers with delight the happy days and sunny mornings when he planted it, the soft evenings when he watered it, and the pleasure he experienced in watching its daily growth.





JUNE 29.


The day before yesterday, the physician came from the town to pay a visit to the judge. He found me on the floor playing with Lotte’s children. Some of them were scrambling over me, and others romped with me; and, as I caught and tickled them, they made a great noise. The doctor is a formal sort of personage: he adjusts the plaits of his ruffles, and continually settles his frill whilst he is talking to you; and he thought my conduct beneath the dignity of a sensible man. I could perceive this by his countenance. But I did not suffer myself to be disturbed. I allowed him to continue his wise conversation, whilst I rebuilt the children’s card houses for them as fast as they threw them down. He went about the town afterward, complaining that the judge’s children were spoiled enough before, but that now Werther was completely ruining them.

Yes, my dear Wilhelm, nothing on this earth affects my heart so much as children. When I look on at their doings; when I mark in the little creatures the seeds of all those virtues and qualities which they will one day find so indispensable; when I behold in the obstinate all the future firmness and constancy of a noble character; in the capricious, that levity and gaiety of temper which will carry them lightly over the dangers and troubles of life, their whole nature simple and unpolluted,—then I call to mind the golden words of the Great Teacher of mankind, “Unless ye become like one of these!” And now, my friend, these children, who are our equals, whom we ought to consider as our models, we treat them as though they were our subjects. They are allowed no will of their own. And have we, then, none ourselves? Whence comes our exclusive right? Is it because we are older and more experienced? Great God! from the height of thy heaven thou beholdest great children and little children, and no others; and thy Son has long since declared which afford thee greatest pleasure. But they believe in him, and hear him not,—that, too, is an old story; and they train their children after their own image, etc.

Adieu, Wilhelm: I will not further bewilder myself with this subject.





JULY 1.


The consolation Lotte can bring to an invalid I experience from my own heart, which suffers more from her absence than many a poor creature lingering on a bed of sickness. She is gone to spend a few days in the town with a very worthy woman, who is given over by the physicians, and wishes to have Lotte near her in her last moments. I accompanied her last week on a visit to the Vicar of S—, a small village in the mountains, about a league hence. We arrived about four o’clock: Lotte had taken her little sister with her. When we entered the vicarage court, we found the good old man sitting on a bench before the door, under the shade of two large walnut-trees. At the sight of Lotte he seemed to gain new life, rose, forgot his stick, and ventured to walk toward her. She ran to him, and made him sit down again; then, placing herself by his side, she gave him a number of messages from her father, and then caught up his youngest child, a dirty, ugly little thing, the joy of his old age, and kissed it. I wish you could have witnessed her attention to this old man,—how she raised her voice on account of his deafness; how she told him of healthy young people, who had been carried off when it was least expected; praised the virtues of Carlsbad, and commended his determination to spend the ensuing summer there; and assured him that he looked better and stronger than he did when she saw him last. I, in the meantime, paid attention to his good lady. The old man seemed quite in spirits; and as I could not help admiring the beauty of the walnut-trees, which formed such an agreeable shade over our heads, he began, though with some little difficulty, to tell us their history. “As to the oldest,” said he, “we do not know who planted it,—some say one clergyman, and some another: but the younger one, there behind us, is exactly the age of my wife, fifty years old next October; her father planted it in the morning, and in the evening she came into the world. My wife’s father was my predecessor here, and I cannot tell you how fond he was of that tree; and it is fully as dear to me. Under the shade of that very tree, upon a log of wood, my wife was seated knitting, when I, a poor student, came into this court for the first time, just seven and twenty years ago.” Lotte inquired for his daughter. He said she was gone with Herr Schmidt to the meadows, and was with the haymakers. The old man then resumed his story, and told us how his predecessor had taken a fancy to him, as had his daughter likewise; and how he had become first his curate, and subsequently his successor. He had scarcely finished his story when his daughter returned through the garden, accompanied by the above-mentioned Herr Schmidt. She welcomed Lotte affectionately, and I confess I was much taken with her appearance. She was a lively-looking, good-humoured brunette, quite competent to amuse one for a short time in the country. Her lover (for such Herr Schmidt evidently appeared to be) was a polite, reserved personage, and would not join our conversation, notwithstanding all Lotte’s endeavours to draw him out. I was much annoyed at observing, by his countenance, that his silence did not arise from want of talent, but from caprice and ill-humour. This subsequently became very evident, when we set out to take a walk, and Frederica joining Lotte, with whom I was talking, the worthy gentleman’s face, which was naturally rather sombre, became so dark and angry that Lotte was obliged to touch my arm, and remind me that I was talking too much to Frederica. Nothing distresses me more than to see men torment each other; particularly when in the flower of their age, in the very season of pleasure, they waste their few short days of sunshine in quarrels and disputes, and only perceive their error when it is too late to repair it. This thought dwelt upon my mind; and in the evening, when we returned to the vicar’s, and were sitting round the table with our bread end milk, the conversation turned on the joys and sorrows of the world, I could not resist the temptation to inveigh bitterly against ill-humour. “We are apt,” said I, “to complain, but—with very little cause, that our happy days are few, and our evil days many. If our hearts were always disposed to receive the benefits Heaven sends us, we should acquire strength to support evil when it comes.” “But,” observed the vicar’s wife, “we cannot always command our tempers, so much depends upon the constitution: when the body suffers, the mind is ill at ease.” “I acknowledge that,” I continued; “but we must consider such a disposition in the light of a disease, and inquire whether there is no remedy for it.”

“I should be glad to hear one,” said Lotte: “at least, I think very much depends upon ourselves; I know it is so with me. When anything annoys me, and disturbs my temper, I hasten into the garden, hum a couple of country dances, and it is all right with me directly.” “That is what I meant,” I replied; “ill-humour resembles indolence: it is natural to us; but if once we have courage to exert ourselves, we find our work run fresh from our hands, and we experience in the activity from which we shrank a real enjoyment.” Frederica listened very attentively: and the young man objected, that we were not masters of ourselves, and still less so of our feelings. “The question is about a disagreeable feeling,” I added, “from which every one would willingly escape, but none know their own power without trial. Invalids are glad to consult physicians, and submit to the most scrupulous regimen, the most nauseous medicines, in order to recover their health.” I observed that the good old man inclined his head, and exerted himself to hear our discourse; so I raised my voice, and addressed myself directly to him. “We preach against a great many crimes,” I observed, “but I never remember a sermon delivered against ill-humour.” “That may do very well for your town clergymen,” said he: “country people are never ill-humoured; though, indeed, it might be useful, occasionally, to my wife for instance, and the judge.” We all laughed, as did he likewise very cordially, till he fell into a fit of coughing, which interrupted our conversation for a time. Herr Schmidt resumed the subject. “You call ill humour a crime,” he remarked, “but I think you use too strong a term.” “Not at all,” I replied, “if that deserves the name which is so pernicious to ourselves and our neighbours. Is it not enough that we want the power to make one another happy, must we deprive each other of the pleasure which we can all make for ourselves? Show me the man who has the courage to hide his ill-humour, who bears the whole burden himself, without disturbing the peace of those around him. No: ill-humour arises from an inward consciousness of our own want of merit, from a discontent which ever accompanies that envy which foolish vanity engenders. We see people happy, whom we have not made so, and cannot endure the sight.” Lotte looked at me with a smile; she observed the emotion with which I spoke: and a tear in the eyes of Frederica stimulated me to proceed. “Woe unto those,” I said, “who use their power over a human heart to destroy the simple pleasures it would naturally enjoy! All the favours, all the attentions, in the world cannot compensate for the loss of that happiness which a cruel tyranny has destroyed.” My heart was full as I spoke. A recollection of many things which had happened pressed upon my mind, and filled my eyes with tears. “We should daily repeat to ourselves,” I exclaimed, “that we should not interfere with our friends, unless to leave them in possession of their own joys, and increase their happiness by sharing it with them! But when their souls are tormented by a violent passion, or their hearts rent with grief, is it in your power to afford them the slightest consolation?

“And when the last fatal malady seizes the being whose untimely grave you have prepared, when she lies languid and exhausted before you, her dim eyes raised to heaven, and the damp of death upon her pallid brow, there you stand at her bedside like a condemned criminal, with the bitter feeling that your whole fortune could not save her; and the agonising thought wrings you, that all your efforts are powerless to impart even a moment’s strength to the departing soul, or quicken her with a transitory consolation.”

At these words the remembrance of a similar scene at which I had been once present fell with full force upon my heart. I buried my face in my handkerchief, and hastened from the room, and was only recalled to my recollection by Lotte’s voice, who reminded me that it was time to return home. With what tenderness she chid me on the way for the too eager interest I took in everything! She declared it would do me injury, and that I ought to spare myself. Yes, my angel! I will do so for your sake.





JULY 6.


She is still with her dying friend, and is still the same bright, beautiful creature whose presence softens pain, and sheds happiness around whichever way she turns. She went out yesterday with her little sisters: I knew it, and went to meet them; and we walked together. In about an hour and a half we returned to the town. We stopped at the spring I am so fond of, and which is now a thousand times dearer to me than ever. Lotte seated herself upon the low wall, and we gathered about her. I looked around, and recalled the time when my heart was unoccupied and free. “Dear fountain!” I said, “since that time I have no more come to enjoy cool repose by thy fresh stream: I have passed thee with careless steps, and scarcely bestowed a glance upon thee.” I looked down, and observed Lotte’s little sister, Jane, coming up the steps with a glass of water. I turned toward Lotte, and I felt her influence over me. Jane at the moment approached with the glass. Her sister, Marianne, wished to take it from her. “No!” cried the child, with the sweetest expression of face, “Lotte must drink first.”

The affection and simplicity with which this was uttered so charmed me, that I sought to express my feelings by catching up the child and kissing her heartily. She was frightened, and began to cry. “You should not do that,” said Lotte: I felt perplexed. “Come, Jane,” she continued, taking her hand, and leading her down the steps again, “it is no matter: wash yourself quickly in the fresh water.” I stood and watched them; and when I saw the little dear rubbing her cheeks with her wet hands, in full belief that all the impurities contracted from my ugly beard would be washed off by the miraculous water, and how, though Lotte said it would do, she continued still to wash with all her might, as though she thought too much were better than too little, I assure you, Wilhelm, I never attended a baptism with greater reverence; and, when Lotte came up from the well, I could have prostrated myself as before the prophet of an Eastern nation.

In the evening I would not resist telling the story to a person who, I thought, possessed some natural feeling, because he was a man of understanding. But what a mistake I made. He maintained it was very wrong of Lotte, that we should not deceive children, that such things occasioned countless mistakes and superstitions, from which we were bound to protect the young. It occurred to me then, that this very man had been baptised only a week before; so I said nothing further, but maintained the justice of my own convictions. We should deal with children as God deals with us, we are happiest under the influence of innocent delusions.





JULY 8.


What a child is man that he should be so solicitous about a look! What a child is man! We had been to Walheim: the ladies went in a carriage; but during our walk I thought I saw in Lotte’s dark eyes—I am a fool—but forgive me! you should see them,—those eyes.—However, to be brief (for my own eyes are weighed down with sleep), you must know, when the ladies stepped into their carriage again, young W. Seldstadt, Andran, and I were standing about the door. They are a merry set of fellows, and they were all laughing and joking together. I watched Lotte’s eyes. They wandered from one to the other; but they did not light on me, on me, who stood there motionless, and who saw nothing but her! My heart bade her a thousand times adieu, but she noticed me not. The carriage drove off; and my eyes filled with tears. I looked after her: suddenly I saw Lotte’s bonnet leaning out of the window, and she turned to look back, was it at me? My dear friend, I know not; and in this uncertainty I find consolation. Perhaps she turned to look at me. Perhaps! Good-night—what a child I am!





JULY 10.


You should see how foolish I look in company when her name is mentioned, particularly when I am asked plainly how I like her. How I like her! I detest the phrase. What sort of creature must he be who merely liked Lotte, whose whole heart and senses were not entirely absorbed by her. Like her! Some one asked me lately how I liked Ossian.





JULY 11.


Madame M—is very ill. I pray for her recovery, because Lotte shares my sufferings. I see her occasionally at my friend’s house, and today she has told me the strangest circumstance. Old M—is a covetous, miserly fellow, who has long worried and annoyed the poor lady sadly; but she has borne her afflictions patiently. A few days ago, when the physician informed us that her recovery was hopeless, she sent for her husband (Lotte was present), and addressed him thus: “I have something to confess, which, after my decease, may occasion trouble and confusion. I have hitherto conducted your household as frugally and economically as possible, but you must pardon me for having defrauded you for thirty years. At the commencement of our married life, you allowed a small sum for the wants of the kitchen, and the other household expenses. When our establishment increased and our property grew larger, I could not persuade you to increase the weekly allowance in proportion: in short, you know, that, when our wants were greatest, you required me to supply everything with seven florins a week. I took the money from you without an observation, but made up the weekly deficiency from the money-chest; as nobody would suspect your wife of robbing the household bank. But I have wasted nothing, and should have been content to meet my eternal Judge without this confession, if she, upon whom the management of your establishment will devolve after my decease, would be free from embarrassment upon your insisting that the allowance made to me, your former wife, was sufficient.”

I talked with Lotte of the inconceivable manner in which men allow themselves to be blinded; how any one could avoid suspecting some deception, when seven florins only were allowed to defray expenses twice as great. But I have myself known people who believed, without any visible astonishment, that their house possessed the prophet’s never-failing cruse of oil.





JULY 13.


No, I am not deceived. In her dark eyes I read a genuine interest in me and in my fortunes. Yes, I feel it; and I may believe my own heart which tells me—dare I say it?—dare I pronounce the divine words?—that she loves me!

That she loves me! How the idea exalts me in my own eyes! And, as you can understand my feelings, I may say to you, how I honour myself since she loves me!

Is this presumption, or is it a consciousness of the truth? I do not know a man able to supplant me in the heart of Lotte; and yet when she speaks of her betrothed with so much warmth and affection, I feel like the soldier who has been stripped of his honours and titles, and deprived of his sword.





JULY 16.


How my heart beats when by accident I touch her finger, or my feet meet hers under the table! I draw back as if from a furnace; but a secret force impels me forward again, and my senses become disordered. Her innocent, unconscious heart never knows what agony these little familiarities inflict upon me. Sometimes when we are talking she Iays her hand upon mine, and in the eagerness of conversation comes closer to me, and her balmy breath reaches my lips,—when I feel as if lightning had struck me, and that I could sink into the earth. And yet, Wilhelm, with all this heavenly confidence,—if I know myself, and should ever dare—you understand me. No, no! my heart is not so corrupt, it is weak, weak enough but is not that a degree of corruption?

She is to me a sacred being. All passion is still in her presence: I cannot express my sensations when I am near her. I feel as if my soul beat in every nerve of my body. There is a melody which she plays on the piano with angelic skill,—so simple is it, and yet so spiritual! It is her favourite air; and, when she plays the first note, all pain, care, and sorrow disappear from me in a moment.

I believe every word that is said of the magic of ancient music. How her simple song enchants me! Sometimes, when I am ready to commit suicide, she sings that air; and instantly the gloom and madness which hung over me are dispersed, and I breathe freely again.





JULY 18.


Wilhelm, what is the world to our hearts without love? What is a magic-lantern without light? You have but to kindle the flame within, and the brightest figures shine on the white wall; and, if love only show us fleeting shadows, we are yet happy, when, like mere children, we behold them, and are transported with the splendid phantoms. I have not been able to see Lotte today. I was prevented by company from which I could not disengage myself. What was to be done? I sent my servant to her house, that I might at least see somebody today who had been near her. Oh, the impatience with which I waited for his return! the joy with which I welcomed him! I should certainly have caught him in my arms, and kissed him, if I had not been ashamed.

It is said that the Bonona stone, when placed in the sun, attracts the rays, and for a time appears luminous in the dark. So was it with me and this servant. The idea that Lotte’s eyes had dwelt on his countenance, his cheek, his very apparel, endeared them all inestimably to me, so that at the moment I would not have parted from him for a thousand crowns. His presence made me so happy! Beware of laughing at me, Wilhelm. Can that be a delusion which makes us happy?





JULY 19.


“I shall see her today!” I exclaim with delight, when I rise in the morning, and look out with gladness of heart at the bright, beautiful sun. “I shall see her today!” And then I have no further wish to form: all, all is included in that one thought.





JULY 20.


I cannot assent to your proposal that I should accompany the ambassador to —. I do not love subordination; and we all know that he is a rough, disagreeable person to be connected with. You say my mother wishes me to be employed. I could not help laughing at that. Am I not sufficiently employed? And is it not in reality the same, whether I shell peas or count lentils? The world runs on from one folly to another; and the man who, solely from regard to the opinion of others, and without any wish or necessity of his own, toils after gold, honour, or any other phantom, is no better than a fool.





JULY 24.


You insist so much on my not neglecting my drawing, that it would be as well for me to say nothing as to confess how little I have lately done.

I never felt happier, I never understood nature better, even down to the veriest stem or smallest blade of grass; and yet I am unable to express myself: my powers of execution are so weak, everything seems to swim and float before me, so that I cannot make a clear, bold outline. But I fancy I should succeed better if I had some clay or wax to model. I shall try, if this state of mind continues much longer, and will take to modelling, if I only knead dough.

I have commenced Lotte’s portrait three times, and have as often disgraced myself. This is the more annoying, as I was formerly very happy in taking likenesses. I have since sketched her profile, and must content myself with that.





JULY 25.


Yes, dear Lotte! I will order and arrange everything. Only give me more commissions, the more the better. One thing, however, I must request: use no more writing-sand with the dear notes you send me. Today I raised your letter hastily to my lips, and it set my teeth on edge.





JULY 26.


I have often determined not to see her so frequently. But who could keep such a resolution? Every day I am exposed to the temptation, and promise faithfully that tomorrow I will really stay away: but, when tomorrow comes, I find some irresistible reason for seeing her; and, before I can account for it, I am with her again. Either she has said on the previous evening “You will be sure to call tomorrow,”—and who could stay away then?—or she gives me some commission, and I find it essential to take her the answer in person; or the day is fine, and I walk to Walheim; and, when I am there, it is only half a league farther to her. I am within the charmed atmosphere, and soon find myself at her side. My grandmother used to tell us a story of a mountain of loadstone. When any vessels came near it, they were instantly deprived of their ironwork: the nails flew to the mountain, and the unhappy crew perished amidst the disjointed planks.





JULY 30.


Albert is arrived, and I must take my departure. Were he the best and noblest of men, and I in every respect his inferior, I could not endure to see him in possession of such a perfect being. Possession!—enough, Wilhelm: her betrothed is here,—a fine, worthy fellow, whom one cannot help liking. Fortunately I was not present at their meeting. It would have broken my heart! And he is so considerate: he has not given Lotte one kiss in my presence. Heaven reward him for it! I must love him for the respect with which he treats her. He shows a regard for me, but for this I suspect I am more indebted to Lotte than to his own fancy for me. Women have a delicate tact in such matters, and it should be so. They cannot always succeed in keeping two rivals on terms with each other; but, when they do, they are the only gainers.

I cannot help esteeming Albert. The coolness of his temper contrasts strongly with the impetuosity of mine, which I cannot conceal. He has a great deal of feeling, and is fully sensible of the treasure he possesses in Lotte. He is free from ill-humour, which you know is the fault I detest most.

He regards me as a man of sense; and my attachment to Lotte, and the interest I take in all that concerns her, augment his triumph and his love. I shall not inquire whether he may not at times tease her with some little jealousies; as I know, that, were I in his place, I should not be entirely free from such sensations.

But, be that as it may, my pleasure with Lotte is over. Call it folly or infatuation, what signifies a name? The thing speaks for itself. Before Albert came, I knew all that I know now. I knew I could make no pretensions to her, nor did I offer any, that is, as far as it was possible, in the presence of so much loveliness, not to pant for its enjoyment. And now, behold me like a silly fellow, staring with astonishment when another comes in, and deprives me of my love.

I bite my lips, and feel infinite scorn for those who tell me to be resigned, because there is no help for it. Let me escape from the yoke of such silly subterfuges! I ramble through the woods; and when I return to Lotte, and find Albert sitting by her side in the summer-house in the garden, I am unable to bear it, behave like a fool, and commit a thousand extravagances. “For Heaven’s sake,” said Lotte today, “let us have no more scenes like those of last night! You terrify me when you are so violent.” Between ourselves, I am always away now when he visits her: and I feel delighted when I find her alone.





AUGUST 8.


Believe me, dear Wilhelm, I did not allude to you when I spoke so severely of those who advise resignation to inevitable fate. I did not think it possible for you to indulge such a sentiment. But in fact you are right. I only suggest one objection. In this world one is seldom reduced to make a selection between two alternatives. There are as many varieties of conduct and opinion as there are turns of feature between an aquiline nose and a flat one.

You will, therefore, permit me to concede your entire argument, and yet contrive means to escape your dilemma.

Your position is this, I hear you say: “Either you have hopes of obtaining Lotte, or you have none. Well, in the first case, pursue your course, and press on to the fulfilment of your wishes. In the second, be a man, and shake off a miserable passion, which will enervate and destroy you.” My dear friend, this is well and easily said.

But would you require a wretched being, whose life is slowly wasting under a lingering disease, to despatch himself at once by the stroke of a dagger? Does not the very disorder which consumes his strength deprive him of the courage to effect his deliverance?

You may answer me, if you please, with a similar analogy, “Who would not prefer the amputation of an arm to the periling of life by doubt and procrastination!” But I know not if I am right, and let us leave these comparisons.

Enough! There are moments, Wilhelm, when I could rise up and shake it all off, and when, if I only knew where to go, I could fly from this place.





THE SAME EVENING.


My diary, which I have for some time neglected, came before me today; and I am amazed to see how deliberately I have entangled myself step by step. To have seen my position so clearly, and yet to have acted so like a child! Even still I behold the result plainly, and yet have no thought of acting with greater prudence.





AUGUST 10.


If I were not a fool, I could spend the happiest and most delightful life here. So many agreeable circumstances, and of a kind to ensure a worthy man’s happiness, are seldom united. Alas! I feel it too sensibly,—the heart alone makes our happiness! To be admitted into this most charming family, to be loved by the father as a son, by the children as a father, and by Lotte! then the noble Albert, who never disturbs my happiness by any appearance of ill-humour, receiving me with the heartiest affection, and loving me, next to Lotte, better than all the world! Wilhelm, you would be delighted to hear us in our rambles, and conversations about Lotte. Nothing in the world can be more absurd than our connection, and yet the thought of it often moves me to tears.

He tells me sometimes of her excellent mother; how, upon her deathbed, she had committed her house and children to Lotte, and had given Lotte herself in charge to him; how, since that time, a new spirit had taken possession of her; how, in care and anxiety for their welfare, she became a real mother to them; how every moment of her time was devoted to some labour of love in their behalf,—and yet her mirth and cheerfulness had never forsaken her. I walk by his side, pluck flowers by the way, arrange them carefully into a nosegay, then fling them into the first stream I pass, and watch them as they float gently away. I forget whether I told you that Albert is to remain here. He has received a government appointment, with a very good salary; and I understand he is in high favour at court. I have met few persons so punctual and methodical in business.





AUGUST 12.


Certainly Albert is the best fellow in the world. I had a strange scene with him yesterday. I went to take leave of him; for I took it into my head to spend a few days in these mountains, from where I now write to you. As I was walking up and down his room, my eye fell upon his pistols. “Lend me those pistols,” said I, “for my journey.” “By all means,” he replied, “if you will take the trouble to load them; for they only hang there for form.” I took down one of them; and he continued, “Ever since I was near suffering for my extreme caution, I will have nothing to do with such things.” I was curious to hear the story. “I was staying,” said he, “some three months ago, at a friend’s house in the country. I had a brace of pistols with me, unloaded; and I slept without any anxiety. One rainy afternoon I was sitting by myself, doing nothing, when it occurred to me I do not know how that the house might be attacked, that we might require the pistols, that we might in short, you know how we go on fancying, when we have nothing better to do. I gave the pistols to the servant, to clean and load. He was playing with the maid, and trying to frighten her, when the pistol went off—God knows how!—the ramrod was in the barrel; and it went straight through her right hand, and shattered the thumb. I had to endure all the lamentation, and to pay the surgeon’s bill; so, since that time, I have kept all my weapons unloaded. But, my dear friend, what is the use of prudence? We can never be on our guard against all possible dangers. However,”—now, you must know I can tolerate all men till they come to “however; ”—for it is self-evident that every universal rule must have its exceptions. But he is so exceedingly accurate, that, if he only fancies he has said a word too precipitate, or too general, or only half true, he never ceases to qualify, to modify, and extenuate, till at last he appears to have said nothing at all. Upon this occasion, Albert was deeply immersed in his subject: I ceased to listen to him, and became lost in reverie. With a sudden motion, I pointed the mouth of the pistol to my forehead, over the right eye. “What do vou mean?” cried Albert, turning back the pistol. “It is not loaded,” said I. “And even if not,” he answered with impatience, “what can you mean? I cannot cornprehend how a man can be so mad as to shoot himself, and the bare idea of it shocks me.”

“But why should any one,” said I, “in speaking of an action, venture to pronounce it mad or wise, or good or bad? What is the meaning of all this? Have you carefully studied the secret motives of our actions? Do you understand—can you explain the causes which occasion them, and make them inevitable? If you can, you will be less hasty with your decision.”

“But you will allow,” said Albert; “that some actions are criminal, let them spring from whatever motives they may.” I granted it, and shrugged my shoulders.

“But still, my good friend,” I continued, “there are some exceptions here too. Theft is a crime; but the man who commits it from extreme poverty, with no design but to save his family from perishing, is he an object of pity, or of punishment? Who shall throw the first stone at a husband, who, in the heat of just resentment, sacrifices his faithless wife and her perfidious seducer? or at the young maiden, who, in her weak hour of rapture, forgets herself in the impetuous joys of love? Even our laws, cold and cruel as they are, relent in such cases, and withhold their punishment.”

“That is quite another thing,” said Albert; “because a man under the influence of violent passion loses alI power of reflection, and is regarded as intoxicated or insane.”

“Oh! you people of sound understandings,” I replied, smiling, “are ever ready to exclaim ‘Extravagance, and madness, and intoxication!’ You moral men are so calm and so subdued! You abhor the drunken man, and detest the extravagant; you pass by, like the Levite, and thank God, like the Pharisee, that you are not like one of them. I have been more than once intoxicated, my passions have always bordered on extravagance: I am not ashamed to confess it; for I have learned, by my own experience, that all extraordinary men, who have accomplished great and astonishing actions, have ever been decried by the world as drunken or insane. And in private life, too, is it not intolerable that no one can undertake the execution of a noble or generous deed, without giving rise to the exclamation that the doer is intoxicated or mad? Shame upon you, ye sages!”

“This is another of your extravagant humours,” said Albert: “you always exaggerate a case, and in this matter you are undoubtedly wrong; for we were speaking of suicide, which you compare with great actions, when it is impossible to regard it as anything but a weakness. It is much easier to die than to bear a life of misery with fortitude.”

I was on the point of breaking off the conversation, for nothing puts me so completely out of patience as the utterance of a wretched commonplace when I am talking from my inmost heart. However, I composed myself, for I had often heard the same observation with sufficient vexation; and I answered him, therefore, with a little warmth, “You call this a weakness—beware of being led astray by appearances. When a nation, which has long groaned under the intolerable yoke of a tyrant, rises at last and throws off its chains, do you call that weakness? The man who, to rescue his house from the flames, finds his physical strength redoubled, so that he lifts burdens with ease, which, in the absence of excitement, he could scarcely move; he who, under the rage of an insult, attacks and puts to flight half a score of his enemies, are such persons to be called weak? My good friend, if resistance be strength, how can the highest degree of resistance be a weakness?”

Albert looked steadfastly at me, and said, “Pray forgive me, but I do not see that the examples you have adduced bear any relation to the question.” “Very likely,” I answered; “for I have often been told that my style of illustration borders a little on the absurd. But let us see if we cannot place the matter in another point of view, by inquiring what can be a man’s state of mind who resolves to free himself from the burden of life,—a burden often so pleasant to bear,—for we cannot otherwise reason fairly upon the subject.

“Human nature,” I continued, “has its limits. It is able to endure a certain degree of joy, sorrow, and pain, but becomes annihilated as soon as this measure is exceeded. The question, therefore, is, not whether a man is strong or weak, but whether he is able to endure the measure of his sufferings. The suffering may be moral or physical; and in my opinion it is just as absurd to call a man a coward who destroys himself, as to call a man a coward who dies of a malignant fever.”

“Paradox, all paradox!” exclaimed Albert. “Not so paradoxical as you imagine,” I replied. “You allow that we designate a disease as mortal when nature is so severely attacked, and her strength so far exhausted, that she cannot possibly recover her former condition under any change that may take place.

“Now, my good friend, apply this to the mind; observe a man in his natural, isolated condition; consider how ideas work, and how impressions fasten on him, till at length a violent passion seizes him, destroying all his powers of calm reflection, and utterly ruining him.

“It is in vain that a man of sound mind and cool temper understands the condition of such a wretched being, in vain he counsels him. He can no more communicate his own wisdom to him than a healthy man can instil his strength into the invalid, by whose bedside he is seated.”

Albert thought this too general. I reminded him of a girl who had drowned herself a short time previously, and I related her history.

She was a good creature, who had grown up in the narrow sphere of household industry and weekly appointed labour; one who knew no pleasure beyond indulging in a walk on Sundays, arrayed in her best attire, accompanied by her friends, or perhaps joining in the dance now and then at some festival, and chatting away her spare hours with a neighbour, discussing the scandal or the quarrels of the village, trifles sufficient to occupy her heart. At length the warmth of her nature is influenced by certain new and unknown wishes. Inflamed by the flatteries of men, her former pleasures become by degrees insipid, till at length she meets with a youth to whom she is attracted by an indescribable feeling; upon him she now rests all her hopes; she forgets the world around her; she sees, hears, desires nothing but him, and him only. He alone occupies all her thoughts. Uncorrupted by the idle indulgence of an enervating vanity, her affection moving steadily toward its object, she hopes to become his, and to realise, in an everlasting union with him, all that happiness which she sought, all that bliss for which she longed. His repeated promises confirm her hopes: embraces and endearments, which increase the ardour of her desires, overmaster her soul. She floats in a dim, delusive anticipation of her happiness; and her feelings become excited to their utmost tension. She stretches out her arms finally to embrace the object of all her wishes and her lover forsakes her. Stunned and bewildered, she stands upon a precipice. All is darkness around her. No prospect, no hope, no consolation—forsaken by him in whom her existence was centred! She sees nothing of the wide world before her, thinks nothing of the many individuals who might supply the void in her heart; she feels herself deserted, forsaken by the world; and, blinded and impelled by the agony which wrings her soul, she plunges into the deep, to end her sufferings in the broad embrace of death. See here, Albert, the history of thousands; and tell me, is not this a case of physical infirmity? Nature has no way to escape from the labyrinth: her powers are exhausted: she can contend no longer, and the poor soul must die.

“Shame upon him who can look on calmly, and exclaim, ‘The foolish girl! she should have waited; she should have allowed time to wear off the impression; her despair would have been softened, and she would have found another lover to comfort her.’ One might as well say, ‘The fool, to die of a fever! why did he not wait till his strength was restored, till his blood became calm? all would then have gone well, and he would have been alive now.’”

Albert, who could not see the justice of the comparison, offered some further objections, and, amongst others, urged that I had taken the case of a mere ignorant girl. But how any man of sense, of more enlarged views and experience, could be excused, he was unable to comprehend. “My friend!” I exclaimed, “man is but man; and, whatever be the extent of his reasoning powers, they are of little avail when passion rages within, and he feels himself confined by the narrow limits of nature. It were better, then—but we will talk of this some other time,” I said, and caught up my hat. Alas! my heart was full; and we parted without conviction on either side. How rarely in this world do men understand each other!





AUGUST 15.


There can be no doubt that in this world nothing is so indispensable as love. I observe that Lotte could not lose me without a pang, and the very children have but one wish; that is, that I should visit them again tomorrow. I went this afternoon to tune Lotte’s piano. But I could not do it, for the little ones insisted on my telling them a story; and Lotte herself urged me to satisfy them. I waited upon them at tea, and they are now as fully contented with me as with Lotte; and I told them my very best tale of the princess who was waited upon by dwarfs. I improve myself by this exercise, and am quite surprised at the impression my stories create. If I sometimes invent an incident which I forget upon the next narration, they remind one directly that the story was different before; so that I now endeavour to relate with exactness the same anecdote in the same monotonous tone, which never changes. I find by this, how much an author injures his works by altering them, even though they be improved in a poetical point of view. The first impression is readily received. We are so constituted that we believe the most incredible things; and, once they are engraved upon the memory, woe to him who would endeavour to efface them.





AUGUST 18.


Must it ever be thus,—that the source of our happiness must also be the fountain of our misery? The full and ardent sentiment which animated my heart with the love of nature, overwhelming me with a torrent of delight, and which brought all paradise before me, has now become an insupportable torment, a demon which perpetually pursues and harasses me. When in bygone days I gazed from these rocks upon yonder mountains across the river, and upon the green, flowery valley before me, and saw all nature budding and bursting around; the hills clothed from foot to peak with tall, thick forest trees; the valleys in all their varied windings, shaded with the loveliest woods; and the soft river gliding along amongst the lisping reeds, mirroring the beautiful clouds which the soft evening breeze wafted across the sky,—when I heard the groves about me melodious with the music of birds, and saw the million swarms of insects dancing in the last golden beams of the sun, whose setting rays awoke the humming beetles from their grassy beds, whilst the subdued tumult around directed my attention to the ground, and I there observed the arid rock compelled to yield nutriment to the dry moss, whilst the heath flourished upon the barren sands below me, all this displayed to me the inner warmth which animates all nature, and filled and glowed within my heart. I felt myself exalted by this overflowing fulness to the perception of the Godhead, and the glorious forms of an infinite universe became visible to my soul! Stupendous mountains encompassed me, abysses yawned at my feet, and cataracts fell headlong down before me; impetuous rivers rolled through the plain, and rocks and mountains resounded from afar. In the depths of the earth I saw innumerable powers in motion, and multiplying to infinity; whilst upon its surface, and beneath the heavens, there teemed ten thousand varieties of living creatures. Everything around is alive with an infinite number of forms; while mankind fly for security to their petty houses, from the shelter of which they rule in their imaginations over the wide-extended universe. Poor fool! in whose petty estimation all things are little. From the inaccessible mountains, across the desert which no mortal foot has trod, far as the confines of the unknown ocean, breathes the spirit of the eternal Creator; and every atom to which he has given existence finds favour in his sight. Ah, how often at that time has the flight of a bird, soaring above my head, inspired me with the desire of being transported to the shores of the immeasurable waters, there to quaff the pleasures of life from the foaming goblet of the Infinite, and to partake, if but for a moment even, with the confined powers of my soul, the beatitude of that Creator who accomplishes all things in himself, and through himself!

My dear friend, the bare recollection of those hours still consoles me. Even this effort to recall those ineffable sensations, and give them utterance, exalts my soul above itself, and makes me doubly feel the intensity of my present anguish.

It is as if a curtain had been drawn from before my eyes, and, instead of prospects of eternal life, the abyss of an ever open grave yawned before me. Can we say of anything that it exists when all passes away, when time, with the speed of a storm, carries all things onward,—and our transitory existence, hurried along by the torrent, is either swallowed up by the waves or dashed against the rocks? There is not a moment but preys upon you,—and upon all around you, not a moment in which you do not yourself become a destroyer. The most innocent walk deprives of life thousands of poor insects: one step destroys the fabric of the industrious ant, and converts a little world into chaos. No: it is not the great and rare calamities of the world, the floods which sweep away whole villages, the earthquakes which swallow up our towns, that affect me. My heart is wasted by the thought of that destructive power which lies concealed in every part of universal nature. Nature has formed nothing that does not consume itself, and every object near it: so that, surrounded by earth and air, and all the active powers, I wander on my way with aching heart; and the universe is to me a fearful monster, for ever devouring its own offspring.





AUGUST 21.


In vain do I stretch out my arms toward her when I awaken in the morning from my weary slumbers. In vain do I seek for her at night in my bed, when some innocent dream has happily deceived me, and placed her near me in the fields, when I have seized her hand and covered it with countless kisses. And when I feel for her in the half confusion of sleep, with the happy sense that she is near, tears flow from my oppressed heart; and, bereft of all comfort, I weep over my future woes.





AUGUST 22.


What a misfortune, Wilhelm! My active spirits have degenerated into contented indolence. I cannot be idle, and yet I am unable to set to work. I cannot think: I have no longer any feeling for the beauties of nature, and books are distasteful to me. Once we give ourselves up, we are totally lost. Many a time and oft I wish I were a common labourer; that, awakening in the morning, I might have but one prospect, one pursuit, one hope, for the day which has dawned. I often envy Albert when I see him buried in a heap of papers and parchments, and I fancy I should be happy were I in his place. Often impressed with this feeling I have been on the point of writing to you and to the minister, for the appointment at the embassy, which you think I might obtain. I believe I might procure it. The minister has long shown a regard for me, and has frequently urged me to seek employment. It is the business of an hour only. Now and then the fable of the horse recurs to me. Weary of liberty, he suffered himself to be saddled and bridled, and was ridden to death for his pains. I know not what to determine upon. For is not this anxiety for change the consequence of that restless spirit which would pursue me equally in every situation of life?





AUGUST 28.


If my ills would admit of any cure, they would certainly be cured here. This is my birthday, and early in the morning I received a packet from Albert. Upon opening it, I found one of the pink ribbons which Lotte wore in her dress the first time I saw her, and which I had several times asked her to give me. With it were two volumes in duodecimo of Wetstein’s Homer, a book I had often wished for, to save me the inconvenience of carrying the large Ernestine edition with me upon my walks. You see how they anticipate my wishes, how well they understand all those little attentions of friendship, so superior to the costly presents of the great, which are humiliating. I kissed the ribbon a thousand times, and in every breath inhaled the remembrance of those happy and irrevocable days which filled me with the keenest joy. Such, Wilhelm, is our fate. I do not murmur at it: the flowers of life are but visionary. How many pass away, and leave no trace behind—how few yield any fruit—and the fruit itself, how rarely does it ripen! And yet there are flowers enough! and is it not strange, my friend, that we should suffer the little that does really ripen, to rot, decay, and perish unenjoyed? Farewell! This is a glorious summer. I often climb into the trees in Lotte’s orchard, and shake down the pears that hang on the highest branches. She stands below, and catches them as they fall.





AUGUST 30.


Unhappy being that I am! Why do I thus deceive myself? What is to come of all this wild, aimless, endless passion? I cannot pray except to her. My imagination sees nothing but her: all surrounding objects are of no account, except as they relate to her. In this dreamy state I enjoy many happy hours, till at length I feel compelled to tear myself away from her. Ah, Wilhelm, to what does not my heart often compel me! When I have spent several hours in her company, till I feel completely absorbed by her figure, her grace, the divine expression of her thoughts, my mind becomes gradually excited to the highest excess, my sight grows dim, my hearing confused, my breathing oppressed as if by the hand of a murderer, and my beating heart seeks to obtain relief for my aching senses. I am sometimes unconscious whether I really exist. If in such moments I find no sympathy, and Lotte does not allow me to enjoy the melancholy consolation of bathing her hand with my tears, I feel compelled to tear myself from her, when I either wander through the country, climb some precipitous cliff, or force a path through the trackless thicket, where I am lacerated and torn by thorns and briers; and thence I find relief. Sometimes I lie stretched on the ground, overcome with fatigue and dying with thirst; sometimes, late in the night, when the moon shines above me, I recline against an aged tree in some sequestered forest, to rest my weary limbs, when, exhausted and worn, I sleep till break of day. O Wilhelm! the hermit’s cell, his sackcloth, and girdle of thorns would be luxury and indulgence compared with what I suffer. Adieu! I see no end to this wretchedness except the grave.





SEPTEMBER 3.


I must away. Thank you, Wilhelm, for determining my wavering purpose. For a whole fortnight I have thought of leaving her. I must away. She has returned to town, and is at the house of a friend. And then, Albert—yes, I must go.





SEPTEMBER 10.


Oh, what a night, Wilhelm! I can henceforth bear anything. I shall never see her again. Oh, why cannot I fall on your neck, and, with floods of tears and raptures, give utterance to all the passions which distract my heart! Here I sit gasping for breath, and struggling to compose myself. I wait for day, and at sunrise the horses are to be at the door.

And she is sleeping calmly, little suspecting that she has seen me for the last time. I am free. I have had the courage, in an interview of two hours’ duration, not to betray my intention. And O Wilhelm, what a conversation it was!

Albert had promised to come to Lotte in the garden immediately after supper. I was upon the terrace under the tall chestnut trees, and watched the setting sun. I saw him sink for the last time beneath this delightful valley and silent stream. I had often visited the same spot with Lotte, and witnessed that glorious sight; and now—I was walking up and down the very avenue which was so dear to me. A secret sympathy had frequently drawn me thither before I knew Lotte; and we were delighted when, in our early acquaintance, we discovered that we each loved the same spot, which is indeed as romantic as any that ever captivated the fancy of an artist.

From beneath the chestnut trees, there is an extensive view. But I remember that I have mentioned all this in a former letter, and have described the tall mass of beech trees at the end, and how the avenue grows darker and darker as it winds its way among them, till it ends in a gloomy recess, which has all the charm of a mysterious solitude. I still remember the strange feeling of melancholy which came over me the first time I entered that dark retreat, at bright midday. I felt some secret foreboding that it would, one day, be to me the scene of some happiness or misery.

I had spent half an hour struggling between the contending thoughts of going and returning, when I heard them coming up the terrace. I ran to meet them. I trembled as I took her hand, and kissed it. As we reached the top of the terrace, the moon rose from behind the wooded hill. We conversed on many subjects, and, without perceiving it, approached the gloomy recess. Lotte entered, and sat down. Albert seated himself beside her. I did the same, but my agitation did not suffer me to remain long seated. I got up, and stood before her, then walked backward and forward, and sat down again. I was restless and miserable. Lotte drew our attention to the beautiful effect of the moonlight, which threw a silver hue over the terrace in front of us, beyond the beech trees. It was a glorious sight, and was rendered more striking by the darkness which surrounded the spot where we were. We remained for some time silent, when Lotte observed, “Whenever I walk by moonlight, it brings to my remembrance all my beloved and departed friends, and I am filled with thoughts of death and futurity. We shall live again, Werther!” she continued, with a firm but feeling voice; “but shall we know one another again what do you think? what do you say?”

“Lotte,” I said, as I took her hand in mine, and my eyes filled with tears, “we shall see each other again—here and hereafter we shall meet again.” I could say no more. Why, Wilhelm, should she put this question to me, just at the moment when the fear of our cruel separation filled my heart?

“And oh! do those departed ones know how we are employed here? do they know when we are well and happy? do they know when we recall their memories with the fondest love? In the silent hour of evening the shade of my mother hovers around me; when seated in the midst of my children, I see them assembled near me, as they used to assemble near her; and then I raise my anxious eyes to heaven, and wish she could look down upon us, and witness how I fulfil the promise I made to her in her last moments, to be a mother to her children. With what emotion do I then exclaim, ‘Pardon, dearest of mothers, pardon me, if I do not adequately supply your place! Alas! I do my utmost. They are clothed and fed; and, still better, they are loved and educated. Could you but see, sweet saint! the peace and harmony that dwells amongst us, you would glorify God with the warmest feelings of gratitude, to whom, in your last hour, you addressed such fervent prayers for our happiness.’” Thus did she express herself; but O Wilhelm! who can do justice to her language? how can cold and passionless words convey the heavenly expressions of the spirit? Albert interrupted her gently. “This affects you too deeply, my dear Lotte. I know your soul dwells on such recollections with intense delight; but I implore—” “O Albert!” she continued, “I am sure you do not forget the evenings when we three used to sit at the little round table, when papa was absent, and the little ones had retired. You often had a good book with you, but seldom read it; the conversation of that noble being was preferable to everything,—that beautiful, bright, gentle, and yet ever-toiling woman. God alone knows how I have supplicated with tears on my nightly couch, that I might be like her.”

I threw myself at her feet, and, seizing her hand, bedewed it with a thousand tears. “Lotte!” I exclaimed, “God’s blessing and your mother’s spirit are upon you.” “Oh! that you had known her,” she said, with a warm pressure of the hand. “She was worthy of being known to you.” I thought I should have fainted: never had I received praise so flattering. She continued, “And yet she was doomed to die in the flower of her youth, when her youngest child was scarcely six months old. Her illness was but short, but she was calm and resigned; and it was only for her children, especially the youngest, that she felt unhappy. When her end drew nigh, she bade me bring them to her. I obeyed. The younger ones knew nothing of their approaching loss, while the elder ones were quite overcome with grief. They stood around the bed; and she raised her feeble hands to heaven, and prayed over them; then, kissing them in turn, she dismissed them, and said to me, ‘Be you a mother to them.’ I gave her my hand. ‘You are promising much, my child,’ she said: ‘a mother’s fondness and a mother’s care! I have often witnessed, by your tears of gratitude, that you know what is a mother’s tenderness: show it to your brothers and sisters, and be dutiful and faithful to your father as a wife; you will be his comfort.’ She inquired for him. He had retired to conceal his intolerable anguish,—he was heartbroken, “Albert, you were in the room. She heard some one moving: she inquired who it was, and desired you to approach. She surveyed us both with a look of composure and satisfaction, expressive of her conviction that we should be happy,—happy with one another.” Albert fell upon her neck, and kissed her, and exclaimed, “We are so, and we shall be so!” Even Albert, generally so tranquil, had quite lost his composure; and I was excited beyond expression.

“And such a being,” She continued, “was to leave us, Werther! Great God, must we thus part with everything we hold dear in this world? Nobody felt this more acutely than the children: they cried and lamented for a long time afterward, complaining that men had carried away their dear mamma.”

Lotte rose. It aroused me; but I continued sitting, and held her hand. “Let us go,” she said: “it grows late.” She attempted to withdraw her hand: I held it still. “We shall see each other again,” I exclaimed: “we shall recognise each other under every possible change! I am going,” I continued, “going willingly; but, should I say for ever, perhaps I may not keep my word. Adieu, Lotte; adieu, Albert. We shall meet again.” “Yes: tomorrow, I think,” she answered with a smile. Tomorrow! how I felt the word! Ah! she little thought, when she drew her hand away from mine. They walked down the avenue. I stood gazing after them in the moonlight. I threw myself upon the ground, and wept: I then sprang up, and ran out upon the terrace, and saw, under the shade of the linden-trees, her white dress disappearing near the garden-gate. I stretched out my arms, and she vanished.





BOOK II


OCTOBER 20.


We arrived here yesterday. The ambassador is indisposed, and will not go out for some days. If he were less peevish and morose, all would be well. I see but too plainly that Heaven has destined me to severe trials; but courage! a light heart may bear anything. A light heart! I smile to find such a word proceeding from my pen. A little more lightheartedness would render me the happiest being under the sun. But must I despair of my talents and faculties, whilst others of far inferior abilities parade before me with the utmost self-satisfaction? Gracious Providence, to whom I owe all my powers, why didst thou not withhold some of those blessings I possess, and substitute in their place a feeling of self-confidence and contentment?

But patience! all will yet be well; for I assure you, my dear friend, you were right: since I have been obliged to associate continually with other people, and observe what they do, and how they employ themselves, I have become far better satisfied with myself. For we are so constituted by nature, that we are ever prone to compare ourselves with others; and our happiness or misery depends very much on the objects and persons around us. On this account, nothing is more dangerous than solitude: there our imagination, always disposed to rise, taking a new flight on the wings of fancy, pictures to us a chain of beings of whom we seem the most inferior. All things appear greater than they really are, and all seem superior to us. This operation of the mind is quite natural: we so continually feel our own imperfections, and fancy we perceive in others the qualities we do not possess, attributing to them also all that we enjoy ourselves, that by this process we form the idea of a perfect, happy man,—a man, however, who only exists in our own imagination.

But when, in spite of weakness and disappointments, we set to work in earnest, and persevere steadily, we often find, that, though obliged continually to tack, we make more way than others who have the assistance of wind and tide; and, in truth, there can be no greater satisfaction than to keep pace with others or outstrip them in the race.





NOVEMBER 26.


I begin to find my situation here more tolerable, considering all circumstances. I find a great advantage in being much occupied; and the number of persons I meet, and their different pursuits, create a varied entertainment for me. I have formed the acquaintance of the Count C— and I esteem him more and more every day. He is a man of strong understanding and great discernment; but, though he sees farther than other people, he is not on that account cold in his manner, but capable of inspiring and returning the warmest affection. He appeared interested in me on one occasion, when I had to transact some business with him. He perceived, at the first word, that we understood each other, and that he could converse with me in a different tone from what he used with others. I cannot sufficiently esteem his frank and open kindness to me. It is the greatest and most genuine of pleasures to observe a great mind in sympathy with our own.





DECEMBER 24.


As I anticipated, the ambassador occasions me infinite annoyance. He is the most punctilious blockhead under heaven. He does everything step by step, with the trifling minuteness of an old woman; and he is a man whom it is impossible to please, because he is never pleased with himself. I like to do business regularly and cheerfully, and, when it is finished, to leave it. But he constantly returns my papers to me, saying, “They will do,” but recommending me to look over them again, as “one may always improve by using a better word or a more appropriate particle.” I then lose all patience, and wish myself at the devil’s. Not a conjunction, not an adverb, must be omitted: he has a deadly antipathy to all those transpositions of which I am so fond; and, if the music of our periods is not tuned to the established, official key, he cannot comprehend our meaning. It is deplorable to be connected with such a fellow.

My acquaintance with the Count C— is the only compensation for such an evil. He told me frankly, the other day, that he was much displeased with the difficulties and delays of the ambassador; that people like him are obstacles, both to themselves and to others. “But,” added he, “one must submit, like a traveller who has to ascend a mountain: if the mountain was not there, the road would be both shorter and pleasanter; but there it is, and he must get over it.”

The old man perceives the count’s partiality for me: this annoys him, and, he seizes every opportunity to depreciate the count in my hearing. I naturally defend him, and that only makes matters worse. Yesterday he made me indignant, for he also alluded to me. “The count,” he said, “is a man of the world, and a good man of business: his style is good, and he writes with facility; but, like other geniuses, he has no solid learning.” He looked at me with an expression that seemed to ask if I felt the blow. But it did not produce the desired effect: I despise a man who can think and act in such a manner. However, I made a stand, and answered with not a little warmth. The count, I said, was a man entitled to respect, alike for his character and his acquirements. I had never met a person whose mind was stored with more useful and extensive knowledge,—who had, in fact, mastered such an infinite variety of subjects, and who yet retained all his activity for the details of ordinary business. This was altogether beyond his comprehension; and I took my leave, lest my anger should be too highly excited by some new absurdity of his.

And you are to blame for all this, you who persuaded me to bend my neck to this yoke by preaching a life of activity to me. If the man who plants vegetables, and carries his corn to town on market-days, is not more usefully employed than I am, then let me work ten years longer at the galleys to which I am now chained.

Oh, the brilliant wretchedness, the weariness, that one is doomed to witness among the silly people whom we meet in society here! The ambition of rank! How they watch, how they toil, to gain precedence! What poor and contemptible passions are displayed in their utter nakedness! We have a woman here, for example, who never ceases to entertain the company with accounts of her family and her estates. Any stranger would consider her a silly being, whose head was turned by her pretensions to rank and property; but she is in reality even more ridiculous, the daughter of a mere magistrate’s clerk from this neighbourhood. I cannot understand how human beings can so debase themselves.

Every day I observe more and more the folly of judging of others by ourselves; and I have so much trouble with myself, and my own heart is in such constant agitation, that I am well content to let others pursue their own course, if they only allow me the same privilege.

What provokes me most is the unhappy extent to which distinctions of rank are carried. I know perfectly well how necessary are inequalities of condition, and I am sensible of the advantages I myself derive therefrom; but I would not have these institutions prove a barrier to the small chance of happiness which I may enjoy on this earth.

I have lately become acquainted with a Miss B—, a very agreeable girl, who has retained her natural manners in the midst of artificial life. Our first conversation pleased us both equally; and, at taking leave, I requested permission to visit her. She consented in so obliging a manner, that I waited with impatience for the arrival of the happy moment. She is not a native of this place, but resides here with her aunt. The countenance of the old lady is not prepossessing. I paid her much attention, addressing the greater part of my conversation to her; and, in less than half an hour, I discovered what her niece subsequently acknowledged to me, that her aged aunt, having but a small fortune, and a still smaller share of understanding, enjoys no satisfaction except in the pedigree of her ancestors, no protection save in her noble birth, and no enjoyment but in looking from her castle over the heads of the humble citizens. She was, no doubt, handsome in her youth, and in her early years probably trifled away her time in rendering many a poor youth the sport of her caprice: in her riper years she has submitted to the yoke of a veteran officer, who, in return for her person and her small independence, has spent with her what we may designate her age of brass. He is dead; and she is now a widow, and deserted. She spends her iron age alone, and would not be approached, except for the loveliness of her niece.





JANUARY 8, 1772.


What beings are men, whose whole thoughts are occupied with form and ceremony, who for years together devote their mental and physical exertions to the task of advancing themselves but one step, and endeavouring to occupy a higher place at the table. Not that such persons would otherwise want employment: on the contrary, they give themselves much trouble by neglecting important business for such petty trifles. Last week a question of precedence arose at a sledging-party, and all our amusement was spoiled.

The silly creatures cannot see that it is not place which constitutes real greatness, since the man who occupies the first place but seldom plays the principal part. How many kings are governed by their ministers—how many ministers by their secretaries? Who, in such cases, is really the chief? He, as it seems to me, who can see through the others, and possesses strength or skill enough to make their power or passions subservient to the execution of his own designs.





JANUARY 20.


I must write to you from this place, my dear Lotte, from a small room in a country inn, where I have taken shelter from a severe storm. During my whole residence in that wretched place D—, where I lived amongst strangers,—strangers, indeed, to this heart,—I never at any time felt the smallest inclination to correspond with you; but in this cottage, in this retirement, in this solitude, with the snow and hail beating against my lattice-pane, you are my first thought. The instant I entered, your figure rose up before me, and the remembrance! O my Lotte, the sacred, tender remembrance! Gracious Heaven! restore to me the happy moment of our first acquaintance.

Could you but see me, my dear Lotte, in the whirl of dissipation,— how my senses are dried up, but my heart is at no time full. I enjoy no single moment of happiness: all is vain—nothing touches me. I stand, as it were, before the raree-show: I see the little puppets move, and I ask whether it is not an optical illusion. I am amused with these puppets, or, rather, I am myself one of them: but, when I sometimes grasp my neighbour’s hand, I feel that it is not natural; and I withdraw mine with a shudder. In the evening I say I will enjoy the next morning’s sunrise, and yet I remain in bed: in the day I promise to ramble by moonlight; and I, nevertheless, remain at home. I know not why I rise, nor why I go to sleep.

The leaven which animated my existence is gone: the charm which cheered me in the gloom of night, and aroused me from my morning slumbers, is for ever fled.

I have found but one being here to interest me, a Miss B—. She resembles you, my dear Lotte, if any one can possibly resemble you. “Ah!” you will say, “he has learned how to pay fine compliments.” And this is partly true. I have been very agreeable lately, as it was not in my power to be otherwise. I have, moreover, a deal of wit: and the ladies say that no one understands flattery better, or falsehoods you will add; since the one accomplishment invariably accompanies the other. But I must tell you of Miss B—. She has abundance of soul, which flashes from her deep blue eyes. Her rank is a torment to her, and satisfies no one desire of her heart. She would gladly retire from this whirl of fashion, and we often picture to ourselves a life of undisturbed happiness in distant scenes of rural retirement: and then we speak of you, my dear Lotte; for she knows you, and renders homage to your merits; but her homage is not exacted, but voluntary, she loves you, and delights to hear you made the subject of conversation.

Oh, that I were sitting at your feet in your favourite little room, with the dear children playing around us! If they became troublesome to you, I would tell them some appalling goblin story; and they would crowd round me with silent attention. The sun is setting in glory; his last rays are shining on the snow, which covers the face of the country: the storm is over, and I must return to my dungeon. Adieu!—Is Albert with you? and what is he to you? God forgive the question.





FEBRUARY 8.


For a week past we have had the most wretched weather: but this to me is a blessing; for, during my residence here, not a single fine day has beamed from the heavens, but has been lost to me by the intrusion of somebody. During the severity of rain, sleet, frost, and storm, I congratulate myself that it cannot be worse indoors than abroad, nor worse abroad than it is within doors; and so I become reconciled. When the sun rises bright in the morning, and promises a glorious day, I never omit to exclaim, “There, now, they have another blessing from Heaven, which they will be sure to destroy: they spoil everything,—health, fame, happiness, amusement; and they do this generally through folly, ignorance, or imbecility, and always, according to their own account, with the best intentions!” I could often beseech them, on my bended knees, to be less resolved upon their own destruction.





FEBRUARY 17.


I fear that my ambassador and I shall not continue much longer together. He is really growing past endurance. He transacts his business in so ridiculous a manner, that I am often compelled to contradict him, and do things my own way; and then, of course, he thinks them very ill done. He complained of me lately on this account at court; and the minister gave me a reprimand,—a gentle one it is true, but still a reprimand. In consequence of this, I was about to tender my resignation, when I received a letter, to which I submitted with great respect, on account of the high, noble, and generous spirit which dictated it. He endeavoured to soothe my excessive sensibility, paid a tribute to my extreme ideas of duty, of good example, and of perseverance in business, as the fruit of my youthful ardour, an impulse which he did not seek to destroy, but only to moderate, that it might have proper play and be productive of good. So now I am at rest for another week, and no longer at variance with myself. Content and peace of mind are valuable things: I could wish, my dear friend, that these precious jewels were less transitory.





FEBRUARY 20.


God bless you, my dear friends, and may he grant you that happiness which he denies to me!

I thank you, Albert, for having deceived me. I waited for the news that your wedding-day was fixed; and I intended on that day, with solemnity, to take down Lotte’s profile from the wall, and to bury it with some other papers I possess. You are now united, and her picture still remains here. Well, let it remain! Why should it not? I know that I am still one of your society, that I still occupy a place uninjured in Lotte’s heart, that I hold the second place therein; and I intend to keep it. Oh, I should become mad if she could forget! Albert, that thought is hell! Farewell, Albert farewell, angel of heaven farewell, Lotte!





MARCH 15.


I have just had a sad adventure, which will drive me away from here. I lose all patience!—Death!—It is not to be remedied; and you alone are to blame, for you urged and impelled me to fill a post for which I was by no means suited. I have now reason to be satisfied, and so have you! But, that you may not again attribute this fatality to my impetuous temper, I send you, my dear sir, a plain and simple narration of the affair, as a mere chronicler of facts would describe it.

The Count of C— likes and distinguishes me. It is well known, and I have mentioned this to you a hundred times. Yesterday I dined with him. It is the day on which the nobility are accustomed to assemble at his house in the evening. I never once thought of the assembly, nor that we subalterns did not belong to such society. Well, I dined with the count; and, after dinner, we adjourned to the large hall. We walked up and down together: and I conversed with him, and with Colonel B—, who joined us; and in this manner the hour for the assembly approached. God knows, I was thinking of nothing, when who should enter but the honourable Lady accompanied by her noble husband and their silly, scheming daughter, with her small waist and flat neck; and, with disdainful looks and a haughty air they passed me by. As I heartily detest the whole race, I determined upon going away; and only waited till the count had disengaged himself from their impertinent prattle, to take leave, when the agreeable Miss B— came in. As I never meet her without experiencing a heartfelt pleasure, I stayed and talked to her, leaning over the back of her chair, and did not perceive, till after some time, that she seemed a little confused, and ceased to answer me with her usual ease of manner. I was struck with it. “Heavens!” I said to myself, “can she, too, be like the rest?” I felt annoyed, and was about to withdraw; but I remained, notwithstanding, forming excuses for her conduct, fancying she did not mean it, and still hoping to receive some friendly recognition. The rest of the company now arrived. There was the Baron F—, in an entire suit that dated from the coronation of Francis I.; the Chancellor R—, with his deaf wife; the shabbily-dressed J—, whose old-fashioned coat bore evidence of modern repairs: this crowned the whole. I conversed with some of my acquaintances, but they answered me laconically. I was engaged in observing Miss B—, and did not notice that the women were whispering at the end of the room, that the murmur extended by degrees to the men, that Madame S— addressed the count with much warmth (this was all related to me subsequently by Miss B—); till at length the count came up to me, and took me to the window. “You know our ridiculous customs,” he said. “I perceive the company is rather displeased at your being here. I would not on any account—” “I beg your excellency’s pardon!” I exclaimed. “I ought to have thought of this before, but I know you will forgive this little inattention. I was going,” I added, “some time ago, but my evil genius detained me.” And I smiled and bowed, to take my leave. He shook me by the hand, in a manner which expressed everything. I hastened at once from the illustrious assembly, sprang into a carriage, and drove to M—. I contemplated the setting sun from the top of the hill, and read that beautiful passage in Homer, where Ulysses is entertained by the hospitable herdsmen. This was indeed delightful.

I returned home to supper in the evening. But few persons were assembled in the room. They had turned up a corner of the table-cloth, and were playing at dice. The good-natured A— came in. He laid down his hat when he saw me, approached me, and said in a low tone, “You have met with a disagreeable adventure.” “I!” I exclaimed. “The count obliged you to withdraw from the assembly!” “Deuce take the assembly!” said I. “I was very glad to be gone.” “I am delighted,” he added, “that you take it so lightly. I am only sorry that it is already so much spoken of.” The circumstance then began to pain me. I fancied that every one who sat down, and even looked at me, was thinking of this incident; and my heart became embittered.

And now I could plunge a dagger into my bosom, when I hear myself everywhere pitied, and observe the triumph of my enemies, who say that this is always the case with vain persons, whose heads are turned with conceit, who affect to despise forms and such petty, idle nonsense.

Say what you will of fortitude, but show me the man who can patiently endure the laughter of fools, when they have obtained an advantage over him. ’Tis only when their nonsense is without foundation that one can suffer it without complaint.





MARCH 16.


Everything conspires against me. I met Miss B— walking today. I could not help joining her; and, when we were at a little distance from her companions, I expressed my sense of her altered manner toward me. “O Werther!” she said, in a tone of emotion, “you, who know my heart, how could you so ill interpret my distress? What did I not suffer for you, from the moment you entered the room! I foresaw it all, a hundred times was I on the point of mentioning it to you. I knew that the S-s and T-s, with their husbands, would quit the room, rather than remain in your company. I knew that the count would not break with them: and now so much is said about it.” “How!” I exclaimed, and endeavoured to conceal my emotion; for all that Adelin had mentioned to me yesterday recurred to me painfully at that moment. “Oh, how much it has already cost me!” said this amiable girl, while her eyes filled with tears. I could scarcely contain myself, and was ready to throw myself at her feet. “Explain yourself!” I cried. Tears flowed down her cheeks. I became quite frantic. She wiped them away, without attempting to conceal them. “You know my aunt,” she continued; “she was present: and in what light does she consider the affair! Last night, and this morning, Werther, I was compelled to listen to a lecture upon my, acquaintance with you. I have been obliged to hear you condemned and depreciated; and I could not—I dared not—say much in your defence.”

Every word she uttered was a dagger to my heart. She did not feel what a mercy it would have been to conceal everything from me. She told me, in addition, all the impertinence that would be further circulated, and how the malicious would triumph; how they would rejoice over the punishment of my pride, over my humiliation for that want of esteem for others with which I had often been reproached. To hear all this, Wilhelm, uttered by her in a voice of the most sincere sympathy, awakened all my passions; and I am still in a state of extreme excitement. I wish I could find a man to jeer me about this event. I would sacrifice him to my resentment. The sight of his blood might possibly be a relief to my fury. A hundred times have I seized a dagger, to give ease to this oppressed heart. Naturalists tell of a noble race of horses that instinctively open a vein with their teeth, when heated and exhausted by a long course, in order to breathe more freely. I am often tempted to open a vein, to procure for myself everlasting liberty.





MARCH 24.


I have tendered my resignation to the court. I hope it will be accepted, and you will forgive me for not having previously consulted you. It is necessary I should leave this place. I know all you will urge me to stay, and therefore I beg you will soften this news to my mother. I am unable to do anything for myself: how, then, should I be competent to assist others? It will afflict her that I should have interrupted that career which would have made me first a privy councillor, and then minister, and that I should look behind me, in place of advancing. Argue as you will, combine all the reasons which should have induced me to remain, I am going: that is sufficient. But, that you may not be ignorant of my destination, I may mention that the Prince of—is here. He is much pleased with my company; and, having heard of my intention to resign, he has invited me to his country house, to pass the spring months with him. I shall be left completely my own master; and, as we agree on all subjects but one, I shall try my fortune, and accompany him.





APRIL 19.


Thanks for both your letters. I delayed my reply, and withheld this letter, till I should obtain an answer from the court. I feared my mother might apply to the minister to defeat my purpose. But my request is granted, my resignation is accepted. I shall not recount with what reluctance it was accorded, nor relate what the minister has written: you would only renew your lamentations. The crown prince has sent me a present of five and twenty ducats; and, indeed, such goodness has affected me to tears. For this reason I shall not require from my mother the money for which I lately applied.





MAY 5.


I leave this place tomorrow; and, as my native place is only six miles from the high road, I intend to visit it once more, and recall the happy dreams of my childhood. I shall enter at the same gate through which I came with my mother, when, after my father’s death, she left that delightful retreat to immure herself in your melancholy town. Adieu, my dear friend: you shall hear of my future career.





MAY 9.


I have paid my visit to my native place with all the devotion of a pilgrim, and have experienced many unexpected emotions. Near the great elm tree, which is a quarter of a league from the village, I got out of the carriage, and sent it on before, that alone, and on foot, I might enjoy vividly and heartily all the pleasure of my recollections. I stood there under that same elm which was formerly the term and object of my walks. How things have since changed! Then, in happy ignorance, I sighed for a world I did not know, where I hoped to find every pleasure and enjoyment which my heart could desire; and now, on my return from that wide world, O my friend, how many disappointed hopes and unsuccessful plans have I brought back!

As I contemplated the mountains which lay stretched out before me, I thought how often they had been the object of my dearest desires. Here used I to sit for hours together with my eyes bent upon them, ardently longing to wander in the shade of those woods, to lose myself in those valleys, which form so delightful an object in the distance. With what reluctance did I leave this charming spot; when my hour of recreation was over, and my leave of absence expired! I drew near to the village: all the well-known old summerhouses and gardens were recognised again; I disliked the new ones, and all other alterations which had taken place. I entered the village, and all my former feelings returned. I cannot, my dear friend, enter into details, charming as were my sensations: they would be dull in the narration. I had intended to lodge in the market-place, near our old house. As soon as I entered, I perceived that the schoolroom, where our childhood had been taught by that good old woman, was converted into a shop. I called to mind the sorrow, the heaviness, the tears, and oppression of heart, which I experienced in that confinement. Every step produced some particular impression. A pilgrim in the Holy Land does not meet so many spots pregnant with tender recollections, and his soul is hardly moved with greater devotion. One incident will serve for illustration. I followed the course of a stream to a farm, formerly a delightful walk of mine, and paused at the spot, where, when boys, we used to amuse ourselves making ducks and drakes upon the water. I recollected so well how I used formerly to watch the course of that same stream, following it with inquiring eagerness, forming romantic ideas of the countries it was to pass through; but my imagination was soon exhausted: while the water continued flowing farther and farther on, till my fancy became bewildered by the contemplation of an invisible distance. Exactly such, my dear friend, so happy and so confined, were the thoughts of our good ancestors. Their feelings and their poetry were fresh as childhood. And, when Ulysses talks of the immeasurable sea and boundless earth, his epithets are true, natural, deeply felt, and mysterious. Of what importance is it that I have learned, with every schoolboy, that the world is round? Man needs but little earth for enjoyment, and still less for his final repose.

I am at present with the prince at his hunting lodge. He is a man with whom one can live happily. He is honest and unaffected. There are, however, some strange characters about him, whom I cannot at all understand. They do not seem vicious, and yet they do not carry the appearance of thoroughly honest men. Sometimes I am disposed to believe them honest, and yet I cannot persuade myself to confide in them. It grieves me to hear the prince occasionally talk of things which he has only read or heard of, and always with the same view in which they have been represented by others.

He values my understanding and talents more highly than my heart, but I am proud of the latter only. It is the sole source of everything of our strength, happiness, and misery. All the knowledge I possess every one else can acquire, but my heart is exclusively my own.





MAY 25.


I have had a plan in my head of which I did not intend to speak to you until it was accomplished: now that it has failed, I may as well mention it. I wished to enter the army, and had long been desirous of taking the step. This, indeed, was the chief reason for my coming here with the prince, as he is a general in the service. I communicated my design to him during one of our walks together. He disapproved of it, and it would have been actual madness not to have listened to his reasons.





JUNE 11.


Say what you will, I can remain here no longer. Why should I remain? Time hangs heavy upon my hands. The prince is as gracious to me as any one could be, and yet I am not at my ease. There is, indeed, nothing in common between us. He is a man of understanding, but quite of the ordinary kind. His conversation affords me no more amusement than I should derive from the perusal of a well-written book. I shall remain here a week longer, and then start again on my travels. My drawings are the best things I have done since I came here. The prince has a taste for the arts, and would improve if his mind were not fettered by cold rules and mere technical ideas. I often lose patience, when, with a glowing imagination, I am giving expression to art and nature, he interferes with learned suggestions, and uses at random the technical phraseology of artists.





JUNE 16.


Once more I am a wanderer, a pilgrim, through the world. But what else are you!





JUNE 18.


Whither am I going? I will tell you in confidence. I am obliged to continue a fortnight longer here, and then I think it would be better for me to visit the mines in—. But I am only deluding myself thus. The fact is, I wish to be near Lotte again, that is all. I smile at the suggestions of my heart, and obey its dictates.





JULY 29.


No, no! it is yet well all is well! I her husband! O God, who gave me being, if thou hadst destined this happiness for me, my whole life would have been one continual thanksgiving! But I will not murmur—forgive these tears, forgive these fruitless wishes. She—my wife! Oh, the very thought of folding that dearest of Heaven’s creatures in my arms! Dear Wilhelm, my whole frame feels convulsed when I see Albert put his arms around her slender waist!

And shall I avow it? Why should I not, Wilhelm? She would have been happier with me than with him. Albert is not the man to satisfy the wishes of such a heart. He wants a certain sensibility; he wants—in short, their hearts do not beat in unison. How often, my dear friend, I’m reading a passage from some interesting book, when my heart and Lotte’s seemed to meet, and in a hundred other instances when our sentiments were unfolded by the story of some fictitious character, have I felt that we were made for each other! But, dear Wilhelm, he loves her with his whole soul; and what does not such a love deserve?

I have been interrupted by an insufferable visit. I have dried my tears, and composed my thoughts. Adieu, my best friend!





AUGUST 4.


I am not alone unfortunate. All men are disappointed in their hopes, and deceived in their expectations. I have paid a visit to my good old woman under the lime-trees. The eldest boy ran out to meet me: his exclamation of joy brought out his mother, but she had a very melancholy look. Her first word was, “Alas! dear sir, my little John is dead.” He was the youngest of her children. I was silent. “And my husband has returned from Switzerland without any money; and, if some kind people had not assisted him, he must have begged his way home. He was taken ill with fever on his journey.” I could answer nothing, but made the little one a present. She invited me to take some fruit: I complied, and left the place with a sorrowful heart.





AUGUST 21.


My sensations are constantly changing. Sometimes a happy prospect opens before me; but alas! it is only for a moment; and then, when I am lost in reverie, I cannot help saying to myself, “If Albert were to die?— Yes, she would become—and I should be”—and so I pursue a chimera, till it leads me to the edge of a precipice at which I shudder.

When I pass through the same gate, and walk along the same road which first conducted me to Lotte, my heart sinks within me at the change that has since taken place. All, all, is altered! No sentiment, no pulsation of my heart, is the same. My sensations are such as would occur to some departed prince whose spirit should return to visit the superb palace which he had built in happy times, adorned with costly magnificence, and left to a beloved son, but whose glory he should find departed, and its halls deserted and in ruins.





SEPTEMBER 3.


I sometimes cannot understand how she can love another, how she dares love another, when I love nothing in this world so completely, so devotedly, as I love her, when I know only her, and have no other possession.





SEPTEMBER 4.


It is even so! As nature puts on her autumn tints it becomes autumn with me and around me. My leaves are sere and yellow, and the neighbouring trees are divested of their foliage. Do you remember my writing to you about a peasant boy shortly after my arrival here? I have just made inquiries about him in Walheim. They say he has been dismissed from his service, and is now avoided by every one. I met him yesterday on the road, going to a neighbouring village. I spoke to him, and he told me his story. It interested me exceedingly, as you will easily understand when I repeat it to you. But why should I trouble you? Why should I not reserve all my sorrow for myself? Why should I continue to give you occasion to pity and blame me? But no matter: this also is part of my destiny.

At first the peasant lad answered my inquiries with a sort of subdued melancholy, which seemed to me the mark of a timid disposition; but, as we grew to understand each other, he spoke with less reserve, and openly confessed his faults, and lamented his misfortune. I wish, my dear friend, I could give proper expression to his language. He told me with a sort of pleasurable recollection, that, after my departure, his passion for his mistress increased daily, until at last he neither knew what he did nor what he said, nor what was to become of him. He could neither eat nor drink nor sleep: he felt a sense of suffocation; he disobeyed all orders, and forgot all commands involuntarily; he seemed as if pursued by an evil spirit, till one day, knowing that his mistress had gone to an upper chamber, he had followed, or, rather, been drawn after her. As she proved deaf to his entreaties, he had recourse to violence. He knows not what happened; but he called God to witness that his intentions to her were honourable, and that he desired nothing more sincerely than that they should marry, and pass their lives together. When he had come to this point, he began to hesitate, as if there was something which he had not courage to utter, till at length he acknowledged with some confusion certain little confidences she had encouraged, and liberties she had allowed. He broke off two or three times in his narration, and assured me most earnestly that he had no wish to make her bad, as he termed it, for he loved her still as sincerely as ever; that the tale had never before escaped his lips, and was only now told to convince me that he was not utterly lost and abandoned. And here, my dear friend, I must commence the old song which you know I utter eternally. If I could only represent the man as he stood, and stands now before me, could I only give his true expressions, you would feel compelled to sympathise in his fate. But enough: you, who know my misfortune and my disposition, can easily comprehend the attraction which draws me toward every unfortunate being, but particularly toward him whose story I have recounted.

On perusing this letter a second time, I find I have omitted the conclusion of my tale; but it is easily supplied. She became reserved toward him, at the instigation of her brother who had long hated him, and desired his expulsion from the house, fearing that his sister’s second marriage might deprive his children of the handsome fortune they expected from her; as she is childless. He was dismissed at length; and the whole affair occasioned so much scandal, that the mistress dared not take him back, even if she had wished it. She has since hired another servant, with whom, they say, her brother is equally displeased, and whom she is likely to marry; but my informant assures me that he himself is determined not to survive such a catastrophe.

This story is neither exaggerated nor embellished: indeed, I have weakened and impaired it in the narration, by the necessity of using the more refined expressions of society.

This love, then, this constancy, this passion, is no poetical fiction. It is actual, and dwells in its greatest purity amongst that class of mankind whom we term rude, uneducated. We are the educated, not the perverted. But read this story with attention, I implore you. I am tranquil today, for I have been employed upon this narration: you see by my writing that I am not so agitated as usual. I read and re-read this tale, Wilhelm: it is the history of your friend! My fortune has been and will be similar; and I am neither half so brave nor half so determined as the poor wretch with whom I hesitate to compare myself.





SEPTEMBER 5.


Lotte had written a letter to her husband in the country, where he was detained by business. It commenced, “My dearest love, return as soon as possible: I await you with a thousand raptures.” A friend who arrived, brought word, that, for certain reasons, he could not return immediately. Lotte’s letter was not forwarded, and the same evening it fell into my hands. I read it, and smiled. She asked the reason. “What a heavenly treasure is imagination:” I exclaimed; “I fancied for a moment that this was written to me.” She paused, and seemed displeased. I was silent.





SEPTEMBER 6.


It cost me much to part with the blue coat which I wore the first time I danced with Lotte. But I could not possibly wear it any longer. But I have ordered a new one, precisely similar, even to the collar and sleeves, as well as a new waistcoat and pantaloons.

But it does not produce the same effect upon me. I know not how it is, but I hope in time I shall like it better.





SEPTEMBER 12.


She has been absent for some days. She went to meet Albert. Today I visited her: she rose to receive me, and I kissed her hand most tenderly.

A canary at the moment flew from a mirror, and settled upon her shoulder. “Here is a new friend,” she observed, while she made him perch upon her hand: “he is a present for the children. What a dear he is! Look at him! When I feed him, he flutters with his wings, and pecks so nicely. He kisses me, too, only look!”

She held the bird to her mouth; and he pressed her sweet lips with so much fervour that he seemed to feel the excess of bliss which he enjoyed.

“He shall kiss you too,” she added; and then she held the bird toward me. His little beak moved from her mouth to mine, and the delightful sensation seemed like the forerunner of the sweetest bliss.

“A kiss,” I observed, “does not seem to satisfy him: he wishes for food, and seems disappointed by these unsatisfactory endearments.”

“But he eats out of my mouth,” she continued, and extended her lips to him containing seed; and she smiled with all the charm of a being who has allowed an innocent participation of her love.

I turned my face away. She should not act thus. She ought not to excite my imagination with such displays of heavenly innocence and happiness, nor awaken my heart from its slumbers, in which it dreams of the worthlessness of life! And why not? Because she knows how much I love her.





SEPTEMBER 15.


It makes me wretched, Wilhelm, to think that there should be men incapable of appreciating the few things which possess a real value in life. You remember the walnut trees at S—, under which I used to sit with Lotte, during my visits to the worthy old vicar. Those glorious trees, the very sight of which has so often filled my heart with joy, how they adorned and refreshed the parsonage yard, with their wide-extended branches! and how pleasing was our remembrance of the good old pastor, by whose hands they were planted so many years ago. The schoolmaster has frequently mentioned his name. He had it from his grandfather. He must have been a most excellent man; and, under the shade of those old trees, his memory was ever venerated by me. The schoolmaster informed us yesterday, with tears in his eyes, that those trees had been felled. Yes, cut to the ground! I could, in my wrath, have slain the monster who struck the first stroke. And I must endure this!—I, who, if I had had two such trees in my own court, and one had died from old age, should have wept with real affliction. But there is some comfort left, such a thing is sentiment, the whole village murmurs at the misfortune; and I hope the vicar’s wife will soon find, by the cessation of the villagers’ presents, how much she has wounded the feelings of the neighbourhood. It was she who did it, the wife of the present incumbent (our good old man is dead), a tall, sickly creature who is so far right to disregard the world, as the world totally disregards her. The silly being affects to be learned, pretends to examine the canonical books, lends her aid toward the new-fashioned reformation of Christendom, moral and critical, and shrugs up her shoulders at the mention of Lavater’s enthusiasm. Her health is destroyed, on account of which she is prevented from having any enjoyment here below. Only such a creature could have cut down my walnut trees! I can never pardon it. Hear her reasons. The falling leaves made the court wet and dirty; the branches obstructed the light; boys threw stones at the nuts when they were ripe, and the noise affected her nerves; and disturbed her profound meditations, when she was weighing the difficulties of Kennicot, Semler, and Michaelis. Finding that all the parish, particularly the old people, were displeased, I asked “why they allowed it?” “Ah, sir!” they replied, “when the steward orders, what can we poor peasants do?” But one thing has happened well. The steward and the vicar (who, for once, thought to reap some advantage from the caprices of his wife) intended to divide the trees between them. The revenue-office, being informed of it, revived an old claim to the ground where the trees had stood, and sold them to the best bidder. There they still lie on the ground. If I were the sovereign, I should know how to deal with them all, vicar, steward, and revenue-office. Sovereign, did I say? I should, in that case, care little about the trees that grew in the country.





OCTOBER 10.


Only to gaze upon her dark eyes is to me a source of happiness! And what grieves me, is, that Albert does not seem so happy as he—hoped to be—as I should have been—if—I am no friend to these pauses, but here I cannot express it otherwise; and probably I am explicit enough.





OCTOBER 12.


Ossian has superseded Homer in my heart. To what a world does the illustrious bard carry me! To wander over pathless wilds, surrounded by impetuous whirlwinds, where, by the feeble light of the moon, we see the spirits of our ancestors; to hear from the mountain-tops, mid the roar of torrents, their plaintive sounds issuing from deep caverns, and the sorrowful lamentations of a maiden who sighs and expires on the mossy tomb of the warrior by whom she was adored. I meet this bard with silver hair; he wanders in the valley; he seeks the footsteps of his fathers, and, alas! he finds only their tombs. Then, contemplating the pale moon, as she sinks beneath the waves of the rolling sea, the memory of bygone days strikes the mind of the hero, days when approaching danger invigorated the brave, and the moon shone upon his bark laden with spoils, and returning in triumph. When I read in his countenance deep sorrow, when I see his dying glory sink exhausted into the grave, as he inhales new and heart-thrilling delight from his approaching union with his beloved, and he casts a look on the cold earth and the tall grass which is so soon to cover him, and then exclaims, “The traveller will come,—he will come who has seen my beauty, and he will ask, ‘Where is the bard, where is the illustrious son of Fingal?’ He will walk over my tomb, and will seek me in vain!” Then, O my friend, I could instantly, like a true and noble knight, draw my sword, and deliver my prince from the long and painful languor of a living death, and dismiss my own soul to follow the demigod whom my hand had set free!





OCTOBER 19.


Alas! the void the fearful void, which I feel in my bosom! Sometimes I think, if I could only once but once, press her to my heart, this dreadful void would be filled.





OCTOBER 26.


Yes, I feel certain, Wilhelm, and every day I become more certain, that the existence of any being whatever is of very little consequence. A friend of Lotte’s called to see her just now. I withdrew into a neighbouring apartment, and took up a book; but, finding I could not read, I sat down to write. I heard them converse in an undertone: they spoke upon indifferent topics, and retailed the news of the town. One was going to be married; another was ill, very ill, she had a dry cough, her face was growing thinner daily, and she had occasional fits. “N— is very unwell too,” said Lotte. “His limbs begin to swell already,” answered the other; and my lively imagination carried me at once to the beds of the infirm. There I see them struggling against death, with all the agonies of pain and horror; and these women, Wilhelm, talk of all this with as much indifference as one would mention the death of a stranger. And when I look around the apartment where I now am—when I see Lotte’s apparel lying before me, and Albert’s writings, and all those articles of furniture which are so familiar to me, even to the very inkstand which I am using,—when I think what I am to this family—everything. My friends esteem me; I often contribute to their happiness, and my heart seems as if it could not beat without them; and yet—if I were to die, if I were to be summoned from the midst of this circle, would they feel—or how long would they feel the void which my loss would make in their existence? How long! Yes, such is the frailty of man, that even there, where he has the greatest consciousness of his own being, where he makes the strongest and most forcible impression, even in the memory, in the heart, of his beloved, there also he must perish,— vanish,—and that quickly.





OCTOBER 27.


I could tear open my bosom with vexation to think how little we are capable of influencing the feelings of each other. No one can communicate to me those sensations of love, joy, rapture, and delight which I do not naturally possess; and, though my heart may glow with the most lively affection, I cannot make the happiness of one in whom the same warmth is not inherent.





THE SAME EVENING.


I possess so much, but my love for her absorbs it all. I possess so much, but without her I have nothing.





OCTOBER 30.


One hundred times have I been on the point of embracing her. Heavens! what a torment it is to see so much loveliness passing and repassing before us, and yet not dare to lay hold of it! And laying hold is the most natural of human instincts. Do not children touch everything they see? And I!





NOVEMBER 3.


Witness, Heaven, how often I lie down in my bed with a wish, and even a hope, that I may never awaken again. And in the morning, when I open my eyes, I behold the sun once more, and am wretched. If I were whimsical, I might blame the weather, or an acquaintance, or some personal disappointment, for my discontented mind; and then this insupportable load of trouble would not rest entirely upon myself. But, alas! I feel it too sadly. I am alone the cause of my own woe, am I not? Truly, my own bosom contains the source of all my sorrow, as it previously contained the source of all my pleasure. Am I not the same being who once enjoyed an excess of happiness, who, at every step, saw paradise open before him, and whose heart was ever expanded toward the whole world? And this heart is now dead, no sentiment can revive it; my eyes are dry; and my senses, no more refreshed by the influence of soft tears, wither and consume my brain. I suffer much, for I have lost the only charm of life: that active, sacred power which created worlds around me,—it is no more. When I look from my window at the distant hills, and behold the morning sun breaking through the mists, and illuminating the country around, which is still wrapped in silence, whilst the soft stream winds gently through the willows, which have shed their leaves; when glorious nature displays all her beauties before me, and her wondrous prospects are ineffectual to extract one tear of joy from my withered heart, I feel that in such a moment I stand like a reprobate before heaven, hardened, insensible, and unmoved. Oftentimes do I then bend my knee to the earth, and implore God for the blessing of tears, as the desponding labourer in some scorching climate prays for the dews of heaven to moisten his parched corn.

But I feel that God does not grant sunshine or rain to our importunate entreaties. And oh, those bygone days, whose memory now torments me! why were they so fortunate? Because I then waited with patience for the blessings of the Eternal, and received his gifts with the grateful feelings of a thankful heart.





NOVEMBER 8.


Lotte has reproved me for my excesses, with so much tenderness and goodness! I have lately been in the habit of drinking more wine than heretofore. “Don’t do it,” she said. “Think of Lotte!” “Think of you!” I answered; “need you bid me do so? Think of you—I do not think of you: you are ever before my soul! This very morning I sat on the spot where, a few days ago, you descended from the carriage, and—” She immediately changed the subject to prevent me from pursuing it farther. My dear friend, my energies are all prostrated: she can do with me what she pleases.





NOVEMBER 15.


I thank you, Wilhelm, for your cordial sympathy, for your excellent advice; and I implore you to be quiet. Leave me to my sufferings. In spite of my wretchedness, I have still strength enough for endurance. I revere religion—you know I do. I feel that it can impart strength to the feeble and comfort to the afflicted, but does it affect all men equally? Consider this vast universe: you will see thousands for whom it has never existed, thousands for whom it will never exist, whether it be preached to them, or not; and must it, then, necessarily exist for me? Does not the Son of God himself say that they are his whom the Father has given to him? Have I been given to him? What if the Father will retain me for himself, as my heart sometimes suggests? I pray you, do not misinterpret this. Do not extract derision from my harmless words. I pour out my whole soul before you. Silence were otherwise preferable to me, but I need not shrink from a subject of which few know more than I do myself. What is the destiny of man, but to fill up the measure of his sufferings, and to drink his allotted cup of bitterness? And if that same cup proved bitter to the God of heaven, under a human form, why should I affect a foolish pride, and call it sweet? Why should I be ashamed of shrinking at that fearful moment, when my whole being will tremble between existence and annihilation, when a remembrance of the past, like a flash of lightning, will illuminate the dark gulf of futurity, when everything shall dissolve around me, and the whole world vanish away? Is not this the voice of a creature oppressed beyond all resource, self-deficient, about to plunge into inevitable destruction, and groaning deeply at its inadequate strength, “My God! my God! why hast thou forsaken me?” And should I feel ashamed to utter the same expression? Should I not shudder at a prospect which had its fears, even for him who folds up the heavens like a garment?





NOVEMBER 21.


She does not feel, she does not know, that she is preparing a poison which will destroy us both; and I drink deeply of the draught which is to prove my destruction. What mean those looks of kindness with which she often—often? no, not often, but sometimes, regards me, that complacency with which she hears the involuntary sentiments which frequently escape me, and the tender pity for my sufferings which appears in her countenance?

Yesterday, when I took leave she seized me by the hand, and said, “Adieu, dear Werther.” Dear Werther! It was the first time she ever called me dear: the sound sunk deep into my heart. I have repeated it a hundred times; and last night, on going to bed, and talking to myself of various things, I suddenly said, “Good night, dear Werther!” and then could not but laugh at myself.





NOVEMBER 22.


I cannot pray, “Leave her to me !” and yet she often seems to belong to me. I cannot pray, “Give her to me!” for she is another’s. In this way I affect mirth over my troubles; and, if I had time, I could compose a whole litany of antitheses.





NOVEMBER 24.


She is sensible of my sufferings. This morning her look pierced my very soul. I found her alone, and she was silent: she steadfastly surveyed me. I no longer saw in her face the charms of beauty or the fire of genius: these had disappeared. But I was affected by an expression much more touching, a look of the deepest sympathy and of the softest pity. Why was I afraid to throw myself at her feet? Why did I not dare to take her in my arms, and answer her by a thousand kisses? She had recourse to her piano for relief, and in a low and sweet voice accompanied the music with delicious sounds. Her lips never appeared so lovely: they seemed but just to open, that they might imbibe the sweet tones which issued from the instrument, and return the heavenly vibration from her lovely mouth. Oh! who can express my sensations? I was quite overcome, and, bending down, pronounced this vow: “Beautiful lips, which the angels guard, never will I seek to profane your purity with a kiss.” And yet, my friend, oh, I wish—but my heart is darkened by doubt and indecision—could I but taste felicity, and then die to expiate the sin! What sin?





NOVEMBER 26.


Oftentimes I say to myself, “Thou alone art wretched: all other mortals are happy, none are distressed like thee!” Then I read a passage in an ancient poet, and I seem to understand my own heart. I have so much to endure! Have men before me ever been so wretched?





NOVEMBER 30.


I shall never be myself again! Wherever I go, some fatality occurs to distract me. Even today alas—for our destiny! alas for human nature!

About dinner-time I went to walk by the river-side, for I had no appetite. Everything around seemed gloomy: a cold and damp easterly wind blew from the mountains, and black, heavy clouds spread over the plain. I observed at a distance a man in a tattered coat: he was wandering among the rocks, and seemed to be looking for plants. When I approached, he turned round at the noise; and I saw that he had an interesting countenance in which a settled melancholy, strongly marked by benevolence, formed the principal feature. His long black hair was divided, and flowed over his shoulders. As his garb betokened a person of the lower order, I thought he would not take it ill if I inquired about his business; and I therefore asked what he was seeking. He replied, with a deep sigh, that he was looking for flowers, and could find none. “But it is not the season,” I observed, with a smile. “Oh, there are so many flowers!” he answered, as he came nearer to me. “In my garden there are roses and honeysuckles of two sorts: one sort was given to me by my father! they grow as plentifully as weeds; I have been looking for them these two days, and cannot find them. There are flowers out there, yellow, blue, and red; and that centaury has a very pretty blossom: but I can find none of them.” I observed his peculiarity, and therefore asked him, with an air of indifference, what he intended to do with his flowers. A strange smile overspread his countenance. Holding his finger to his mouth, he expressed a hope that I would not betray him; and he then informed me that he had promised to gather a nosegay for his mistress. “That is right,” said I. “Oh!” he replied, “she possesses many other things as well: she is very rich.” “And yet,” I continued, “she likes your nosegays.” “Oh, she has jewels and crowns!” he exclaimed. I asked who she was. “If the states-general would but pay me,” he added, “I should be quite another man. Alas! there was a time when I was so happy; but that is past, and I am now—” He raised his swimming eyes to heaven. “And you were happy once?” I observed. “Ah, would I were so still!” was his reply. “I was then as gay and contented as a man can be.” An old woman, who was coming toward us, now called out, “Henry, Henry! where are you? We have been looking for you everywhere: come to dinner.” “Is he your son?” I inquired, as I went toward her. “Yes,” she said: “he is my poor, unfortunate son. The Lord has sent me a heavy affliction.” I asked whether he had been long in this state. She answered, “He has been as calm as he is at present for about six months. I thank Heaven that he has so far recovered: he was for one whole year quite raving, and chained down in a madhouse. Now he injures no one, but talks of nothing else than kings and queens. He used to be a very good, quiet youth, and helped to maintain me; he wrote a very fine hand; but all at once he became melancholy, was seized with a violent fever, grew distracted, and is now as you see. If I were only to tell you, sir—” I interrupted her by asking what period it was in which he boasted of having been so happy. “Poor boy!” she exclaimed, with a smile of compassion, “he means the time when he was completely deranged, a time he never ceases to regret, when he was in the madhouse, and unconscious of everything.” I was thunderstruck: I placed a piece of money in her hand, and hastened away.

“You were happy!” I exclaimed, as I returned quickly to the town, “‘as gay and contented as a man can be!’” God of heaven! and is this the destiny of man? Is he only happy before he has acquired his reason, or after he has lost it? Unfortunate being! And yet I envy your fate: I envy the delusion to which you are a victim. You go forth with joy to gather flowers for your princess,—in winter,—and grieve when you can find none, and cannot understand why they do not grow. But I wander forth without joy, without hope, without design; and I return as I came. You fancy what a man you would be if the states general paid you. Happy mortal, who can ascribe your wretchedness to an earthly cause! You do not know, you do not feel, that in your own distracted heart and disordered brain dwells the source of that unhappiness which all the potentates onearth cannot relieve.

Let that man die unconsoled who can deride the invalid for undertaking a journey to distant, healthful springs, where he often finds only a heavier disease and a more painful death, or who can exult over the despairing mind of a sinner, who, to obtain peace of conscience and an alleviation of misery, makes a pilgrimage to the Holy Sepulchre. Each laborious step which galls his wounded feet in rough and untrodden paths pours a drop of balm into his troubled soul, and the journey of many a weary day brings a nightly relief to his anguished heart. Will you dare call this enthusiasm, ye crowd of pompous declaimers? Enthusiasm! O God! thou seest my tears. Thou hast allotted us our portion of misery: must we also have brethren to persecute us, to deprive us of our consolation, of our trust in thee, and in thy love and mercy? For our trust in the virtue of the healing root, or in the strength of the vine, what is it else than a belief in thee from whom all that surrounds us derives its healing and restoring powers? Father, whom I know not,—who wert once wont to fill my soul, but who now hidest thy face from me,—call me back to thee; be silent no longer; thy silence shall not delay a soul which thirsts after thee. What man, what father, could be angry with a son for returning to him suddenly, for falling on his neck, and exclaiming, “I am here again, my father! forgive me if I have anticipated my journey, and returned before the appointed time! The world is everywhere the same,—a scene of labour and pain, of pleasure and reward; but what does it all avail? I am happy only where thou art, and in thy presence am I content to suffer or enjoy.” And wouldst thou, heavenly Father, banish such a child from thy presence?





DECEMBER 1.


Wilhelm, the man about whom I wrote to you—that man so enviable in his misfortunes—was secretary to Lotte’s father; and an unhappy passion for her which he cherished, concealed, and at length discovered, caused him to be dismissed from his situation. This made him mad. Think, whilst you peruse this plain narration, what an impression the circumstance has made upon me! But it was related to me by Albert with as much calmness as you will probably peruse it.





DECEMBER 4.


I implore your attention. It is all over with me. I can support this state no longer. Today I was sitting by Lotte. She was playing upon her piano a succession of delightful melodies, with such intense expression! Her little sister was dressing her doll upon my lap. The tears came into my eyes. I leaned down, and looked intently at her wedding-ring: my tears fell—immediately she began to play that favourite, that divine, air which has so often enchanted me. I felt comfort from a recollection of the past, of those bygone days when that air was familiar to me; and then I recalled all the sorrows and the disappointments which I had since endured. I paced with hasty strides through the room, my heart became convulsed with painful emotions. At length I went up to her, and exclaimed with eagerness, “For Heaven’s sake, play that air no longer!” She stopped, and looked steadfastly at me. She then said, with a smile which sunk deep into my heart, “Werther, you are ill: your dearest food is distasteful to you. But go, I entreat you, and endeavour to compose yourself.” I tore myself away. God, thou seest my torments, and wilt end them!





DECEMBER 6.


How her image haunts me! Waking or asleep, she fills my entire soul! Soon as I close my eyes, here, in my brain, where all the nerves of vision are concentrated, her dark eyes are imprinted. Here—I do not know how to describe it; but, if I shut my eyes, hers are immediately before me: dark as an abyss they open upon me, and absorb my senses.

And what is man—that boasted demigod? Do not his powers fail when he most requires their use? And whether he soar in joy, or sink in sorrow, is not his career in both inevitably arrested? And, whilst he fondly dreams that he is grasping at infinity, does he not feel compelled to return to a consciousness of his cold, monotonous existence?





THE EDITOR TO THE READER


It is a matter of extreme regret that we want original evidence of the last remarkable days of our friend; and we are, therefore, obliged to interrupt the progress of his correspondence, and to supply the deficiency by a connected narration.

I have felt it my duty to collect accurate information from the mouths of persons well acquainted with his history. The story is simple; and all the accounts agree, except in some unimportant particulars. It is true, that, with respect to the characters of the persons spoken of, opinions and judgments vary.

We have only, then, to relate conscientiously the facts which our diligent labour has enabled us to collect, to give the letters of the deceased, and to pay particular attention to the slightest fragment from his pen, more especially as it is so difficult to discover the real and correct motives of men who are not of the common order.

Sorrow and discontent had taken deep root in Werther’s soul, and gradually imparted their character to his whole being. The harmony of his mind became completely disturbed; a perpetual excitement and mental irritation, which weakened his natural powers, produced the saddest effects upon him, and rendered him at length the victim of an exhaustion against which he struggled with still more painful efforts than he had displayed, even in contending with his other misfortunes. His mental anxiety weakened his various good qualities; and he was soon converted into a gloomy companion, always unhappy and unjust in his ideas, the more wretched he became. This was, at least, the opinion of Albert’s friends. They assert, moreover, that the character of Albert himself had undergone no change in the meantime: he was still the same being whom Werther had loved, honoured, and respected from the commencement. His love for Lotte was unbounded: he was proud of her, and desired that she should be recognised by every one as the noblest of created beings. Was he, however, to blame for wishing to avert from her every appearance of suspicion? or for his unwillingness to share his rich prize with another, even for a moment, and in the most innocent manner? It is asserted that Albert frequently retired from his wife’s apartment during Werther’s visits; but this did not arise from hatred or aversion to his friend, but only from a feeling that his presence was oppressive to Werther.

Lotte’s father, who was confined to the house by indisposition, was accustomed to send his carriage for her, that she might make excursions in the neighbourhood. One day the weather had been unusually severe, and the whole country was covered with snow.

Werther went for Lotte the following morning, in order that, if Albert were absent, he might conduct her home.

The beautiful weather produced but little impression on his troubled spirit. A heavy weight lay upon his soul, deep melancholy had taken possession of him, and his mind knew no change save from one painful thought to another.

As he now never enjoyed internal peace, the condition of his fellow creatures was to him a perpetual source of trouble and distress. He believed he had disturbed the happiness of Albert and his wife; and, whilst he censured himself strongly for this, he began to entertain a secret dislike to Albert.

His thoughts were occasionally directed to this point. “Yes,” he would repeat to himself, with ill-concealed dissatisfaction, “yes, this is, after all, the extent of that confiding, dear, tender, and sympathetic love, that calm and eternal fidelity! What do I behold but satiety and indifference? Does not every frivolous engagement attract him more than his charming and lovely wife? Does he know how to prize his happiness? Can he value her as she deserves? He possesses her, it is true, I know that, as I know much more, and I have become accustomed to the thought that he will drive me mad, or, perhaps, murder me. Is his friendship toward me unimpaired? Does he not view my attachment to Lotte as an infringement upon his rights, and consider my attention to her as a silent rebuke to himself? I know, and indeed feel, that he dislikes me, that he wishes for my absence, that my presence is hateful to him.”

He would often pause when on his way to visit Lotte, stand still, as though in doubt, and seem desirous of returning, but would nevertheless proceed; and, engaged in such thoughts and soliloquies as we have described, he finally reached the hunting-lodge, with a sort of involuntary consent.

Upon one occasion he entered the house; and, inquiring for Lotte, he observed that the inmates were in a state of unusual confusion. The eldest boy informed him that a dreadful misfortune had occurred at Walheim,— that a peasant had been murdered! But this made little impression upon him. Entering the apartment, he found Lotte engaged reasoning with her father, who, in spite of his infirmity, insisted on going to the scene of the crime, in order to institute an inquiry. The criminal was unknown; the victim had been found dead at his own door that morning. Suspicions were excited: the murdered man had been in the service of a widow, and the person who had previously filled the situation had been dismissed from her employment.

As soon as Werther heard this, he exclaimed with great excitement, “It is possible! I must go to the spot—I cannot delay a moment!” He hastened to Walheim. Every incident returned vividly to his remembrance; and he entertained not the slightest doubt that that man was the murderer to whom he had so often spoken, and for whom he entertained so much regard. His way took him past the well-known lime trees, to the house where the body had been carried; and his feelings were greatly excited at the sight of the fondly recollected spot. That threshold where the neighbours’ children had so often played together was stained with blood; love and attachment, the noblest feelings of human nature, had been converted into violence and murder. The huge trees stood there leafless and covered with hoarfrost; the beautiful hedgerows which surrounded the old churchyard wall were withered; and the gravestones, half covered with snow, were visible through the openings.

As he approached the inn, in front of which the whole village was assembled, screams were suddenly heard. A troop of armed peasants was seen approaching, and every one exclaimed that the criminal had been apprehended. Werther looked, and was not long in doubt. The prisoner was no other than the servant, who had been formerly so attached to the widow, and whom he had met prowling about, with that suppressed anger and ill-concealed despair, which we have before described.

“What have you done, unfortunate man?” inquired Werther, as he advanced toward the prisoner. The latter turned his eyes upon him in silence, and then replied with perfect composure; “No one will now marry her, and she will marry no one.” The prisoner was taken into the inn, and Werther left the place. The mind of Werther was fearfully excited by this shocking occurrence. He ceased, however, to be oppressed by his usual feeling of melancholy, moroseness, and indifference to everything that passed around him. He entertained a strong degree of pity for the prisoner, and was seized with an indescribable anxiety to save him from his impending fate. He considered him so unfortunate, he deemed his crime so excusable, and thought his own condition so nearly similar, that he felt convinced he could make every one else view the matter in the light in which he saw it himself. He now became anxious to undertake his defence, and commenced composing an eloquent speech for the occasion; and, on his way to the hunting-lodge, he could not refrain from speaking aloud the statement which he resolved to make to the judge.

Upon his arrival, he found Albert had been before him: and he was a little perplexed by this meeting; but he soon recovered himself, and expressed his opinion with much warmth to the judge. The latter shook, his head doubtingly; and although Werther urged his case with the utmost zeal, feeling, and determination in defence of his client, yet, as we may easily suppose, the judge was not much influenced by his appeal. On the contrary, he interrupted him in his address, reasoned with him seriously, and even administered a rebuke to him for becoming the advocate of a murderer. He demonstrated, that, according to this precedent, every law might be violated, and the public security utterly destroyed. He added, moreover, that in such a case he could himself do nothing, without incurring the greatest responsibility; that everything must follow in the usual course, and pursue the ordinary channel.

Werther, however, did not abandon his enterprise, and even besought the judge to connive at the flight of the prisoner. But this proposal was peremptorily rejected. Albert, who had taken some part in the discussion, coincided in opinion with the judge. At this Werther became enraged, and took his leave in great anger, after the judge had more than once assured him that the prisoner could not be saved.

The excess of his grief at this assurance may be inferred from a note we have found amongst his papers, and which was doubtless written upon this very occasion.

You cannot be saved, unfortunate man! I see clearly that we cannot be saved!

Werther was highly incensed at the observations which Albert had made to the judge in this matter of the prisoner. He thought he could detect therein a little bitterness toward himself personally; and although, upon reflection, it could not escape his sound judgment that their view of the matter was correct, he felt the greatest possible reluctance to make such an admission.

A memorandum of Werther’s upon this point, expressive of his general feelings toward Albert, has been found amongst his papers.

What is the use of my continually repeating that he is a good and estimable man? He is an inward torment to me, and I am incapable of being just toward him.

One fine evening in winter, when the weather seemed inclined to thaw, Lotte and Albert were returning home together. The former looked from time to time about her, as if she missed Werther’s company. Albert began to speak of him, and censured him for his prejudices. He alluded to his unfortunate attachment, and wished it were possible to discontinue his acquaintance. “I desire it on our own account,” he added; “and I request you will compel him to alter his deportment toward you, and to visit you less frequently. The world is censorious, and I know that here and there we are spoken of.” Lotte made no reply, and Albert seemed to feel her silence. At least, from that time he never again spoke of Werther; and, when she introduced the subject, he allowed the conversation to die away, or else he directed the discourse into another channel.

The vain attempt Werther had made to save the unhappy murderer was the last feeble glimmering of a flame about to be extinguished. He sank almost immediately afterward into a state of gloom and inactivity, until he was at length brought to perfect distraction by learning that he was to be summoned as a witness against the prisoner, who asserted his complete innocence.

His mind now became oppressed by the recollection of every misfortune of his past life. The mortification he had suffered at the ambassador’s, and his subsequent troubles, were revived in his memory. He became utterly inactive. Destitute of energy, he was cut off from every pursuit and occupation which compose the business of common life; and he became a victim to his own susceptibility, and to his restless passion for the most amiable and beloved of women, whose peace he destroyed. In this unvarying monotony of existence his days were consumed; and his powers became exhausted without aim or design, until they brought him to a sorrowful end.

A few letters which he left behind, and which we here subjoin, afford the best proofs of his anxiety of mind and of the depth of his passion, as well as of his doubts and struggles, and of his weariness of life.





DECEMBER 12.


Dear Wilhelm, I am reduced to the condition of those unfortunate wretches who believe they are pursued by an evil spirit. Sometimes I am oppressed, not by apprehension or fear, but by an inexpressible internal sensation, which weighs upon my heart, and impedes my breath! Then I wander forth at night, even in this tempestuous season, and feel pleasure in surveying the dreadful scenes around me.

Yesterday evening I went forth. A rapid thaw had suddenly set in: I had been informed that the river had risen, that the brooks had all overflowed their banks, and that the whole vale of Walheim was under water! Upon the stroke of twelve I hastened forth. I beheld a fearful sight. The foaming torrents rolled from the mountains in the moonlight,—fields and meadows, trees and hedges, were confounded together; and the entire valley was converted into a deep lake, which was agitated by the roaring wind! And when the moon shone forth, and tinged the black clouds with silver, and the impetuous torrent at my feet foamed and resounded with awful and grand impetuosity, I was overcome by a mingled sensation of apprehension and delight. With extended arms I looked down into the yawning abyss, and cried, “Plunge!” For a moment my senses forsook me, in the intense delight of ending my sorrows and my sufferings by a plunge into that gulf! And then I felt as if I were rooted to the earth, and incapable of seeking an end to my woes! But my hour is not yet come: I feel it is not. O Wilhelm, how willingly could I abandon my existence to ride the whirlwind, or to embrace the torrent! and then might not rapture perchance be the portion of this liberated soul?

I turned my sorrowful eyes toward a favourite spot, where I was accustomed to sit with Lotte beneath a willow after a fatiguing walk. Alas! it was covered with water, and with difficulty I found even the meadow. And the fields around the hunting-lodge, thought I. Has our dear bower been destroyed by this unpitying storm? And a beam of past happiness streamed upon me, as the mind of a captive is illumined by dreams of flocks and herds and bygone joys of home! But I am free from blame. I have courage to die! Perhaps I have,— but I still sit here, like a wretched pauper, who collects fagots, and begs her bread from door to door, that she may prolong for a few days a miserable existence which she is unwilling to resign.





DECEMBER 14.


What is the matter with me, dear Wilhelm? I am afraid of myself! Is not my love for her of the purest, most holy, and most brotherly nature? Has my soul ever been sullied by a single sensual desire? but I will make no protestations. And now, ye nightly visions, how truly have those mortals understood you, who ascribe your various contradictory effects to some invincible power! This night I tremble at the avowal—I held her in my arms, locked in a close embrace: I pressed her to my bosom, and covered with countless kisses those dear lips which murmured in reply soft protestations of love. My sight became confused by the delicious intoxication of her eyes. Heavens! is it sinful to revel again in such happiness, to recall once more those rapturous moments with intense delight? Lotte! Lotte! I am lost! My senses are bewildered, my recollection is confused, mine eyes are bathed in tears—I am ill; and yet I am well—I wish for nothing—I have no desires—it were better I were gone.

Under the circumstances narrated above, a determination to quit this world had now taken fixed possession of Werther’s soul. Since Lotte’s return, this thought had been the final object of all his hopes and wishes; but he had resolved that such a step should not be taken with precipitation, but with calmness and tranquillity, and with the most perfect deliberation.

His troubles and internal struggles may be understood from the following fragment, which was found, without any date, amongst his papers, and appears to have formed the beginning of a letter to Wilhelm.

Her presence, her fate, her sympathy for me, have power still to extract tears from my withered brain.

One lifts up the curtain, and passes to the other side,—that is all! And why all these doubts and delays? Because we know not what is behind—because there is no returning—and because our mind infers that all is darkness and confusion, where we have nothing but uncertainty.

His appearance at length became quite altered by the effect of his melancholy thoughts; and his resolution was now finally and irrevocably taken, of which the following ambiguous letter, which he addressed to his friend, may appear to afford some proof.





DECEMBER 20.


I am grateful to your love, Wilhelm, for having repeated your advice so seasonably. Yes, you are right: it is undoubtedly better that I should depart. But I do not entirely approve your scheme of returning at once to your neighbourhood; at least, I should Iike to make a little excursion on the way, particularly as we may now expect a continued frost, and consequently good roads. I am much pleased with your intention of coming to fetch me; only delay your journey for a fortnight, and wait for another letter from me. One should gather nothing before it is ripe, and a fortnight sooner or later makes a great difference. Entreat my mother to pray for her son, and tell her I beg her pardon for all the unhappiness I have occasioned her. It has ever been my fate to give pain to those whose happiness I should have promoted. Adieu, my dearest friend. May every blessing of Heaven attend you! Farewell.

We find it difficult to express the emotions with which Lotte’s soul was agitated during the whole of this time, whether in relation to her husband or to her unfortunate friend; although we are enabled, by our knowledge of her character, to understand their nature.

It is certain that she had formed a determination, by every means in her power to keep Werther at a distance; and, if she hesitated in her decision, it was from a sincere feeling of friendly pity, knowing how much it would cost him, indeed, that he would find it almost impossible to comply with her wishes. But various causes now urged her to be firm. Her hushand preserved a strict silence about the whole matter; and she never made it a subject of conversation, feeling bound to prove to him by her conduct that her sentiments agreed with his.

The same day, which was the Sunday before Christmas, after Werther had written the last-mentioned letter to his friend, he came in the evening to Lotte’s house, and found her alone. She was busy preparing some little gifts for her brothers and sisters, which were to be distributed to them on Christmas Day. He began talking of the delight of the children, and of that age when the sudden appearance of the Christmas-tree, decorated with fruit and sweetmeats, and lighted up with wax candles, causes such transports of joy. “You shall have a gift too, if you behave well,” said Lotte, hiding her embarrassment under sweet smile. “And what do you call behaving well? What should I do, what can I do, my dear Lotte?” said he. “Thursday night,” she answered, “is Christmas Eve. The children are all to be here, and my father too: there is a present for each; do you come likewise, but do not come before that time.” Werther started. “I desire you will not: it must be so,” she continued. “I ask it of you as a favour, for my own peace and tranquillity. We cannot go on in this manner any longer.” He turned away his face walked hastily up and down the room, muttering indistinctly, “We cannot go on in this manner any longer!” Lotte, seeing the violent agitation into which these words had thrown him, endeavoured to divert his thoughts by different questions, but in vain. “No, Lotte!” he exclaimed; “I will never see you any more!” “And why so?” she answered. “We may—we must see each other again; only let it be with more discretion. Oh! why were you born with that excessive, that ungovernable passion for everything that is dear to you?” Then, taking his hand, she said, “I entreat of you to be more calm: your talents, your understanding, your genius, will furnish you with a thousand resources. Be a man, and conquer an unhappy attachment toward a creature who can do nothing but pity you.” He bit his lips, and looked at her with a gloomy countenance. She continued to hold his hand. “Grant me but a moment’s patience, Werther,” she said. “Do you not see that you are deceiving yourself, that you are seeking your own destruction? Why must you love me, me only, who belong to another? I fear, I much fear, that it is only the impossibility of possessing me which makes your desire for me so strong.” He drew back his hand, whilst he surveyed her with a wild and angry look. “’Tis well!” he exclaimed, “’tis very well! Did not Albert furnish you with this reflection? It is profound, a very profound remark.” “A reflection that any one might easily make,” she answered; “and is there not a woman in the whole world who is at liberty, and has the power to make you happy? Conquer yourself: look for such a being, and believe me when I say that you will certainly find her. I have long felt for you, and for us all: you have confined yourself too long within the limits of too narrow a circle. Conquer yourself; make an effort: a short journey will be of service to you. Seek and find an object worthy of your love; then return hither, and let us enjoy together all the happiness of the most perfect friendship.”

“This speech,” replied Werther with a cold smile, “this speech should be printed, for the benefit of all teachers. My dear Lotte, allow me but a short time longer, and all will be well.” “But however, Werther,” she added, “do not come again before Christmas.” He was about to make some answer, when Albert came in. They saluted each other coldly, and with mutual embarrassment paced up and down the room. Werther made some common remarks; Albert did the same, and their conversation soon dropped. Albert asked his wife about some household matters; and, finding that his commissions were not executed, he used some expressions which, to Werther’s ear, savoured of extreme harshness. He wished to go, but had not power to move; and in this situation he remained till eight o’clock, his uneasiness and discontent continually increasing. At length the cloth was laid for supper, and he took up his hat and stick. Albert invited him to remain; but Werther, fancying that he was merely paying a formal compliment, thanked him coldly, amd left the house.

Werther returned home, took the candle from his servant, and retired to his room alone. He talked for some time with great earnestness to himself, wept aloud, walked in a state of great excitement through his chamber; till at length, without undressing, he threw himself on the bed, where he was found by his servant at eleven o’clock, when the latter ventured to enter the room, and take off his boots. Werther did not prevent him, but forbade him to come in the morning till he should ring.

On Monday morning, the 21st of December, he wrote to Lotte the following letter, which was found, sealed, on his bureau after his death, and was given to her. I shall insert it in fragments; as it appears, from several circumstances, to have been written in that manner.

It is all over, Lotte: I am resolved to die! I make this declaration deliberately and coolly, without any romantic passion, on this morning of the day when I am to see you for the last time. At the moment you read these lines, O best of women, the cold grave will hold the inanimate remains of that restless and unhappy being who, in the last moments of his existence, knew no pleasure so great as that of conversing with you! I have passed a dreadful night or rather, let me say, a propitious one; for it has given me resolution, it has fixed my purpose. I am resolved to die. When I tore myself from you yesterday, my senses were in tumult and disorder; my heart was oppressed, hope and pleasure had fled from me for ever, and a petrifying cold had seized my wretched being. I could scarcely reach my room. I threw myself on my knees; and Heaven, for the last time, granted me the consolation of shedding tears. A thousand ideas, a thousand schemes, arose within my soul; till at length one last, fixed, final thought took possession of my heart. It was to die. I lay down to rest; and in the morning, in the quiet hour of awakening, the same determination was upon me. To die! It is not despair: it is conviction that I have filled up the measure of my sufferings, that I have reached my appointed term, and must sacrifice myself for thee. Yes, Lotte, why should I not avow it? One of us three must die: it shall be Werther. O beloved Lotte! this heart, excited by rage and fury, has often conceived the horrid idea of murdering your husband—you— myself! The lot is cast at length. And in the bright, quiet evenings of summer, when you sometimes wander toward the mountains, let your thoughts then turn to me: recollect how often you have watched me coming to meet you from the valley; then bend your eyes upon the churchyard which contains my grave, and, by the light of the setting sun, mark how the evening breeze waves the tall grass which grows above my tomb. I was calm when I began this letter, but the recollection of these scenes makes me weep like a child.

About ten in the morning, Werther called his servant, and, whilst he was dressing, told him that in a few days he intended to set out upon a journey, and bade him therefore lay his clothes in order, and prepare them for packing up, call in all his accounts, fetch home the books he had lent, and give two months’ pay to the poor dependants who were accustomed to receive from him a weekly allowance.

He breakfasted in his room, and then mounted his horse, and went to visit the steward, who, however, was not at home. He walked pensively in the garden, and seemed anxious to renew all the ideas that were most painful to him.

The children did not suffer him to remain alone long. They followed him, skipping and dancing before him, and told him, that after tomorrow and tomorrow and one day more, they were to receive their Christmas gift from Lotte; and they then recounted all the wonders of which they had formed ideas in their child imaginations. “Tomorrow and tomorrow,” said he, “and one day more!” And he kissed them tenderly. He was going; but the younger boy stopped him, to whisper something in his ear. He told him that his elder brothers had written splendid New Year’s wishes so large! one for papa, and another for Albert and Lotte, and one for Werther; and they were to be presented early in the morning, on New Year’s Day. This quite overcame him. He made each of the children a present, mounted his horse, left his compliments for papa and mamma, and, with tears in his eyes, rode away from the place.

He returned home about five o’clock, ordered his servant to keep up his fire, desired him to pack his books and linen at the bottom of the trunk, and to place his coats at the top. He then appears to have made the following addition to the letter addressed to Lotte:

You do not expect me. You think I will obey you, and not visit you again till Christmas Eve. O Lotte, today or never! On Christmas Eve you will hold this paper in your hand; you will tremble, and moisten it with your tears. I will—I must! Oh, how happy I feel to be determined!

In the meantime, Lotte was in a pitiable state of mind. After her last conversation with Werther, she found how painful to herself it would be to decline his visits, and knew how severely he would suffer from their separation.

She had, in conversation with Albert, mentioned casually that Werther would not return before Christmas Eve; and soon afterward Albert went on horseback to see a person in the neighbourhood, with whom he had to transact some business which would detain him all night.

Lotte was sitting alone. None of her family were near, and she gave herself up to the reflections that silently took possession of her mind. She was for ever united to a husband whose love and fidelity she had proved, to whom she was heartily devoted, and who seemed to be a special gift from Heaven to ensure her happiness. On the other hand, Werther had become dear to her. There was a cordial unanimity of sentiment between them from the very first hour of their acquaintance, and their long association and repeated interviews had made an indelible impression upon her heart. She had been accustomed to communicate to him every thought and feeling which interested her, and his absence threatened to open a void in her existence which it might be impossible to fill. How heartily she wished that she might change him into her brother,—that she could induce him to marry one of her own friends, or could reestablish his intimacy with Albert.

She passed all her intimate friends in review before her mind, but found something objectionable in each, and could decide upon none to whom she would consent to give him.

Amid all these considerations she felt deeply but indistinctly that her own real but unexpressed wish was to retain him for herself, and her pure and amiable heart felt from this thought a sense of oppression which seemed to forbid a prospect of happiness. She was wretched: a dark cloud obscured her mental vision.

It was now half-past six o’clock, and she heard Werther’s step on the stairs. She at once recognised his voice, as he inquired if she were at home. Her heart beat audibly—we could almost say for the first time—at his arrival. It was too late to deny herself; and, as he entered, she exclaimed, with a sort of ill concealed confusion, “You have not kept your word!” “I promised nothing,” he answered. “But you should have complied, at least for my sake,” she continued. “I implore you, for both our sakes.”

She scarcely knew what she said or did; and sent for some friends, who, by their presence, might prevent her being left alone with Werther. He put down some books he had brought with him, then made inquiries about some others, until she began to hope that her friends might arrive shortly, entertaining at the same time a desire that they might stay away.

At one moment she felt anxious that the servant should remain in the adjoining room, then she changed her mind. Werther, meanwhile, walked impatiently up and down. She went to the piano, and determined not to retire. She then collected her thoughts, and sat down quietly at Werther’s side, who had taken his usual place on the sofa.

“Have you brought nothing to read?” she inquired. He had nothing. “There in my drawer,” she continued, “you will find your own translation of some of the songs of Ossian. I have not yet read them, as I have still hoped to hear you recite them; but, for some time past, I have not been able to accomplish such a wish.” He smiled, and went for the manuscript, which he took with a shudder. He sat down; and, with eyes full of tears, he began to read.

Star of descending night! fair is thy light in the west! thou liftest thy unshorn head from thy cloud; thy steps are stately on thy hill. What dost thou behold in the plain? The stormy winds are laid. The murmur of the torrent comes from afar. Roaring waves climb the distant rock. The flies of evening are on their feeble wings: the hum of their course is on the field. What dost thou behold, fair light? But thou dost smile and depart. The waves come with joy around thee: they bathe thy lovely hair. Farewell, thou silent beam! Let the light of Ossian’s soul arise!

And it does arise in its strength! I behold my departed friends. Their gathering is on Lora, as in the days of other years. Fingal comes like a watery column of mist! his heroes are around: and see the bards of song, gray-haired Ullin! stately Ryno! Alpin with the tuneful voice: the soft complaint of Minona! How are ye changed, my friends, since the days of Selma’s feast! when we contended, like gales of spring as they fly along the hill, and bend by turns the feebly whistling grass.

Minona came forth in her beauty, with downcast look and tearful eye. Her hair was flying slowly with the blast that rushed unfrequent from the hill. The souls of the heroes were sad when she raised the tuneful voice. Oft had they seen the grave of Salgar, the dark dwelling of white-bosomed Colma. Colma left alone on the hill with all her voice of song! Salgar promised to come! but the night descended around. Hear the voice of Colma, when she sat alone on the hill!

Colma.

It is night: I am alone, forlorn on the hill of storms. The wind is heard on the mountain. The torrent is howling down the rock. No hut receives me from the rain: forlorn on the hill of winds!

Rise moon! from behind thy clouds. Stars of the night, arise! Lead me, some light, to the place where my love rests from the chase alone! His bow near him unstrung, his dogs panting around him! But here I must sit alone by the rock of the mossy stream. The stream and the wind roar aloud. I hear not the voice of my love! Why delays my Salgar; why the chief of the hill his promise? Here is the rock and here the tree! here is the roaring stream! Thou didst promise with night to be here. Ah! whither is my Salgar gone? With thee I would fly from my father, with thee from my brother of pride. Our race have long been foes: we are not foes, O Salgar!

Cease a little while, O wind! stream, be thou silent awhile! let my voice be heard around! let my wanderer hear me! Salgar! it is Colma who calls. Here is the tree and the rock. Salgar, my love, I am here! Why delayest thou thy coming? Lo! the calm moon comes forth. The flood is bright in the vale. The rocks are gray on the steep. I see him not on the brow. His dogs come not before him with tidings of his near approach. Here I must sit alone!

Who lie on the heath beside me? Are they my love and my brother? Speak to me, O my friends! To Colma they give no reply. Speak to me: I am alone! My soul is tormented with fears. Ah, they are dead! Their swords are red from the fight. O my brother! my brother! why hast thou slain my Salgar! Why, O Salgar, hast thou slain my brother! Dear were ye both to me! what shall I say in your praise? Thou wert fair on the hill among thousands! he was terrible in fight! Speak to me! hear my voice! hear me, sons of my love! They are silent! silent for ever! Cold, cold, are their breasts of clay! Oh, from the rock on the hill, from the top of the windy steep, speak, ye ghosts of the dead! Speak, I will not be afraid! Whither are ye gone to rest? In what cave of the hill shall I find the departed? No feeble voice is on the gale: no answer half drowned in the storm!

I sit in my grief: I wait for morning in my tears! Rear the tomb, ye friends of the dead. Close it not till Colma come. My life flies away like a dream. Why should I stay behind? Here shall I rest with my friends, by the stream of the sounding rock. When night comes on the hill when the loud winds arise my ghost shall stand in the blast, and mourn the death of my friends. The hunter shall hear from his booth; he shall fear, but love my voice! For sweet shall my voice be for my friends: pleasant were her friends to Colma.

Such was thy song, Minona, softly blushing daughter of Torman. Our tears descended for Colma, and our souls were sad! Ullin came with his harp; he gave the song of Alpin. The voice of Alpin was pleasant, the soul of Ryno was a beam of fire! But they had rested in the narrow house: their voice had ceased in Selma! Ullin had returned one day from the chase before the heroes fell. He heard their strife on the hill: their song was soft, but sad! They mourned the fall of Morar, first of mortal men! His soul was like the soul of Fingal: his sword like the sword of Oscar. But he fell, and his father mourned: his sister’s eyes were full of tears. Minona’s eyes were full of tears, the sister of car-borne Morar. She retired from the song of Ullin, like the moon in the west, when she foresees the shower, and hides her fair head in a cloud. I touched the harp with Ullin: the song of morning rose!

Ryno.

The wind and the rain are past, calm is the noon of day. The clouds are divided in heaven. Over the green hills flies the inconstant sun. Red through the stony vale comes down the stream of the hill. Sweet are thy murmurs, O stream! but more sweet is the voice I hear. It is the voice of Alpin, the son of song, mourning for the dead! Bent is his head of age: red his tearful eye. Alpin, thou son of song, why alone on the silent hill? why complainest thou, as a blast in the wood as a wave on the lonely shore?

Alpin.

My tears, O Ryno! are for the dead my voice for those that have passed away. Tall thou art on the hill; fair among the sons of the vale. But thou shalt fall like Morar: the mourner shall sit on thy tomb. The hills shall know thee no more: thy bow shall lie in thy hall unstrung!

Thou wert swift, O Morar! as a roe on the desert: terrible as a meteor of fire. Thy wrath was as the storm. Thy sword in battle as lightning in the field. Thy voice was as a stream after rain, like thunder on distant hills. Many fell by thy arm: they were consumed in the flames of thy wrath. But when thou didst return from war, how peaceful was thy brow. Thy face was like the sun after rain: like the moon in the silence of night: calm as the breast of the lake when the loud wind is laid.

Narrow is thy dwelling now! dark the place of thine abode! With three steps I compass thy grave, O thou who wast so great before! Four stones, with their heads of moss, are the only memorial of thee. A tree with scarce a leaf, long grass which whistles in the wind, mark to the hunter’s eye the grave of the mighty Morar. Morar! thou art low indeed. Thou hast no mother to mourn thee, no maid with her tears of love. Dead is she that brought thee forth. Fallen is the daughter of Morglan.

Who on his staff is this? Who is this whose head is white with age, whose eyes are red with tears, who quakes at every step? It is thy father, O Morar! the father of no son but thee. He heard of thy fame in war, he heard of foes dispersed. He heard of Morar’s renown, why did he not hear of his wound? Weep, thou father of Morar! Weep, but thy son heareth thee not. Deep is the sleep of the dead, low their pillow of dust. No more shall he hear thy voice, no more awake at thy call. When shall it be morn in the grave, to bid the slumberer awake? Farewell, thou bravest of men! thou conqueror in the field! but the field shall see thee no more, nor the dark wood be lightened with the splendour of thy steel. Thou has left no son. The song shall preserve thy name. Future times shall hear of thee they shall hear of the fallen Morar!

The grief of all arose, but most the bursting sigh of Armin. He remembers the death of his son, who fell in the days of his youth. Carmor was near the hero, the chief of the echoing Galmal. Why burst the sigh of Armin? he said. Is there a cause to mourn? The song comes with its music to melt and please the soul. It is like soft mist that, rising from a lake, pours on the silent vale; the green flowers are filled with dew, but the sun returns in his strength, and the mist is gone. Why art thou sad, O Armin, chief of sea-surrounded Gorma?

Sad I am! nor small is my cause of woe! Carmor, thou hast lost no son; thou hast lost no daughter of beauty. Colgar the valiant lives, and Annira, fairest maid. The boughs of thy house ascend, O Carmor! but Armin is the last of his race. Dark is thy bed, O Daura! deep thy sleep in the tomb! When shalt thou wake with thy songs? with all thy voice of music?

Arise, winds of autumn, arise: blow along the heath. Streams of the mountains, roar; roar, tempests in the groves of my oaks! Walk through broken clouds, O moon! show thy pale face at intervals; bring to my mind the night when all my children fell, when Arindal the mighty fell—when Daura the lovely failed. Daura, my daughter, thou wert fair, fair as the moon on Fura, white as the driven snow, sweet as the breathing gale. Arindal, thy bow was strong, thy spear was swift on the field, thy look was like mist on the wave, thy shield a red cloud in a storm! Armar, renowned in war, came and sought Daura’s love. He was not long refused: fair was the hope of their friends.

Erath, son of Odgal, repined: his brother had been slain by Armar. He came disguised like a son of the sea: fair was his cliff on the wave, white his locks of age, calm his serious brow. Fairest of women, he said, lovely daughter of Armin! a rock not distant in the sea bears a tree on its side; red shines the fruit afar. There Armar waits for Daura. I come to carry his love! she went she called on Armar. Nought answered, but the son of the rock. Armar, my love, my love! why tormentest thou me with fear? Hear, son of Arnart, hear! it is Daura who calleth thee. Erath, the traitor, fled laughing to the land. She lifted up her voice—she called for her brother and her father. Arindal! Armin! none to relieve you, Daura.

Her voice came over the sea. Arindal, my son, descended from the hill, rough in the spoils of the chase. His arrows rattled by his side; his bow was in his hand, five dark-gray dogs attended his steps. He saw fierce Erath on the shore; he seized and bound him to an oak. Thick wind the thongs of the hide around his limbs; he loads the winds with his groans. Arindal ascends the deep in his boat to bring Daura to land. Armar came in his wrath, and let fly the grayfeathered shaft. It sung, it sunk in thy heart, O Arindal, my son! for Erath the traitor thou diest. The oar is stopped at once: he panted on the rock, and expired. What is thy grief, O Daura, when round thy feet is poured thy brother’s blood. The boat is broken in twain. Armar plunges into the sea to rescue his Daura, or die. Sudden a blast from a hill came over the waves; he sank, and he rose no more.

Alone, on the sea-beat rock, my daughter was heard to complain; frequent and loud were her cries. What could her father do? All night I stood on the shore: I saw her by the faint beam of the moon. All night I heard her cries. Loud was the wind; the rain beat hard on the hill. Before morning appeared, her voice was weak; it died away like the evening breeze among the grass of the rocks. Spent with grief, she expired, and left thee, Armin, alone. Gone is my strength in war, fallen my pride among women. When the storms aloft arise, when the north lifts the wave on high, I sit by the sounding shore, and look on the fatal rock.

Often by the setting moon I see the ghosts of my children; half viewless they walk in mournful conference together.

A torrent of tears which streamed from Lotte’s eyes and gave relief to her bursting heart, stopped Werther’s recitation. He threw down the book, seized her hand, and wept bitterly. Lotte leaned upon her hand, and buried her face in her handkerchief: the agitation of both was excessive. They felt that their own fate was pictured in the misfortunes of Ossian’s heroes, they felt this together, and their tears redoubled. Werther supported his forehead on Lotte’s arm: she trembled, she wished to be gone; but sorrow and sympathy lay like a leaden weight upon her soul. She recovered herself shortly, and begged Werther, with broken sobs, to leave her, implored him with the utmost earnestness to comply with her request. He trembled; his heart was ready to burst: then, taking up the book again, he recommenced reading, in a voice broken by sobs.

Why dost thou waken me, O spring? Thy voice woos me, exclaiming, I refresh thee with heavenly dews; but the time of my decay is approaching, the storm is nigh that shall whither my leaves. Tomorrow the traveller shall come, he shall come, who beheld me in beauty: his eye shall seek me in the field around, but he shall not find me.

The whole force of these words fell upon the unfortunate Werther. Full of despair, he threw himself at Lotte’s feet, seized her hands, and pressed them to his eyes and to his forehead. An apprehension of his fatal project now struck her for the first time. Her senses were bewildered: she held his hands, pressed them to her bosom; and, leaning toward him with emotions of the tenderest pity, her warm cheek touched his. They lost sight of everything. The world disappeared from their eyes. He clasped her in his arms, strained her to his bosom, and covered her trembling lips with passionate kisses. “Werther!” she cried with a faint voice, turning herself away; “Werther!” and, with a feeble hand, she pushed him from her. At length, with the firm voice of virtue, she exclaimed, “Werther!” He resisted not, but, tearing himself from her arms, fell on his knees before her. Lotte rose, and, with disordered grief, in mingled tones of love and resentment, she exclaimed, “It is the last time, Werther! You shall never see me any more!” Then, casting one last, tender look upon her unfortunate lover, she rushed into the adjoining room, and locked the door. Werther held out his arms, but did not dare to detain her. He continued on the ground, with his head resting on the sofa, for half an hour, till he heard a noise which brought him to his senses. The servant entered. He then walked up and down the room; and, when he was again left alone, he went to Lotte’s door, and, in a low voice, said, “Lotte, Lotte! but one word more, one last adieu!” She returned no answer. He stopped, and listened and entreated; but all was silent. At length he tore himself from the place, crying, “Adieu, Lotte, adieu for ever!”

Werther ran to the gate of the town. The guards, who knew him, let him pass in silence. The night was dark and stormy,—it rained and snowed. He reached his own door about eleven. His servant, although seeing him enter the house without his hat, did not venture to say anything; and, as he undressed his master, he found that his clothes were wet. His hat was afterward found on the point of a rock overhanging the valley; and it is inconceivable how he could have climbed to the summit on such a dark, tempestuous night without losing his life.

He retired to bed, and slept to a late hour. The next morning his servant, upon being called to bring his coffee, found him writing. He was adding, to Lotte, what we here annex.

For the last, last time I open these eyes. Alas! they will behold the sun no more. It is covered by a thick, impenetrable cloud. Yes, Nature! put on mourning: your child, your friend, your lover, draws near his end! This thought, Lotte, is without parallel; and yet it seems like a mysterious dream when I repeat—this is my last day! The last! Lotte, no word can adequately express this thought. The last! Today I stand erect in all my strength tomorrow, cold and stark, I shall lie extended upon the ground. To die! what is death? We do but dream in our discourse upon it. I have seen many human beings die; but, so straitened is our feeble nature, we have no clear conception of the beginning or the end of our existence. At this moment I am my own—or rather I am thine, thine, my adored! and the next we are parted, severed—perhaps for ever! No, Lotte, no! How can I, how can you, be annihilated? We exist. What is annihilation? A mere word, an unmeaning sound that fixes no impression on the mind. Dead, Lotte! laid in the cold earth, in the dark and narrow grave! I had a friend once who was everything to me in early youth. She died. I followed her hearse; I stood by her grave when the coffin was lowered; and when I heard the creaking of the cords as they were loosened and drawn up, when the first shovelful of earth was thrown in, and the coffin returned a hollow sound, which grew fainter and fainter till all was completely covered over, I threw myself on the ground; my heart was smitten, grieved, shattered, rent—but I neither knew what had happened, nor what was to happen to me. Death! the grave! I understand not the words.—Forgive, oh, forgive me! Yesterday—ah, that day should have been the last of my life! Thou angel! for the first time in my existence, I felt rapture glow within my inmost soul. She loves, she loves me! Still burns upon my lips the sacred fire they received from thine. New torrents of delight overwhelm my soul. Forgive me, oh, forgive!

I knew that I was dear to you; I saw it in your first entrancing look, knew it by the first pressure of your hand; but when I was absent from you, when I saw Albert at your side, my doubts and fears returned.

Do you remember the flowers you sent me, when, at that crowded assembly, you could neither speak nor extend your hand to me? Half the night I was on my knees before those flowers, and I regarded them as the pledges of your love; but those impressions grew fainter, and were at length effaced.

Everything passes away; but a whole eternity could not extinguish the living flame which was yesterday kindled by your lips, and which now burns within me. She loves me! These arms have encircled her waist, these lips have trembled upon hers. She is mine! Yes, Lotte, you are mine for ever!

And what do they mean by saying Albert is your husband? He may be so for this world; and in this world it is a sin to love you, to wish to tear you from his embrace. Yes, it is a crime; and I suffer the punishment, but I have enjoyed the full delight of my sin. I have inhaled a balm that has revived my soul. From this hour you are mine; yes, Lotte, you are mine! I go before you. I go to my Father and to your Father. I will pour out my sorrows before him, and he will give me comfort till you arrive. Then will I fly to meet you. I will claim you, and remain your eternal embrace, in the presence of the Almighty.

I do not dream, I do not rave. Drawing nearer to the grave my perceptions become clearer. We shall exist; we shall see each other again; we shall behold your mother; I shall behold her, and expose to her my inmost heart. Your mother—your image!

About eleven o’clock Werther asked his servant if Albert had returned. He answered, “Yes; ” for he had seen him pass on horseback: upon which Werther sent him the following note, unsealed:

Be so good as to lend me your pistols for a journey. Adieu.

Lotte had slept little during the past night. All her apprehensions were realised in a way that she could neither foresee nor avoid. Her blood was boiling in her veins, and a thousand painful sensations rent her pure heart. Was it the ardour of Werther’s passionate embraces that she felt within her bosom? Was it anger at his daring? Was it the sad comparison of her present condition with former days of innocence, tranquillity, and self-confidence? How could she approach her husband, and confess a scene which she had no reason to conceal, and which she yet felt, nevertheless, unwilling to avow? They had preserved so long a silence toward each other and should she be the first to break it by so unexpected a discovery? She feared that the mere statement of Werther’s visit would trouble him, and his distress would be heightened by her perfect candour. She wished that he could see her in her true light, and judge her without prejudice; but was she anxious that he should read her inmost soul? On the other hand, could she deceive a being to whom all her thoughts had ever been exposed as clearly as crystal, and from whom no sentiment had ever been concealed? These reflections made her anxious and thoughtful. Her mind still dwelt on Werther, who was now lost to her, but whom she could not bring herself to resign, and for whom she knew nothing was left but despair if she should be lost to him for ever.

A recollection of that mysterious estrangement which had lately subsisted between herself and Albert, and which she could never thoroughly understand, was now beyond measure painful to her. Even the prudent and the good have before now hesitated to explain their mutual differences, and have dwelt in silence upon their imaginary grievances, until circumstances have become so entangled, that in that critical juncture, when a calm explanation would have saved all parties, an understanding was impossible. And thus if domestic confidence had been earlier established between them, if love and kind forbearance had mutually animated and expanded their hearts, it might not, perhaps, even yet have been too late to save our friend.

But we must not forget one remarkable circumstance. We may observe from the character of Werther’s correspondence, that he had never affected to conceal his anxious desire to quit this world. He had often discussed the subject with Albert; and, between the latter and Lotte, it had not unfrequently formed a topic of conversation. Albert was so opposed to the very idea of such an action, that, with a degree of irritation unusual in him, he had more than once given Werther to understand that he doubted the seriousness of his threats, and not only turned them into ridicule, but caused Lotte to share his feelings of incredulity. Her heart was thus tranquillized when she felt disposed to view the melancholy subject in a serious point of view, though she never communicated to her husband the apprehensions she sometimes experienced.

Albert, upon his return, was received by Lotte with ill-concealed embarrassment. He was himself out of humour; his business was unfinished; and he had just discovered that the neighbouring official with whom he had to deal, was an obstinate and narrow-minded personage. Many things had occurred to irritate him.

He inquired whether anything had happened during his absence, and Lotte hastily answered that Werther had been there on the evening previously. He then inquired for his letters, and was answered that several packages had been left in his study. He thereon retired, leaving Lotte alone.

The presence of the being she loved and honoured produced a new impression on her heart. The recollection of his generosity, kindness, and affection had calmed her agitation: a secret impulse prompted her to follow him; she took her work and went to his study, as was often her custom. He was busily employed opening and reading his letters. It seemed as if the contents of some were disagreeable. She asked some questions: he gave short answers, and sat down to write.

Several hours passed in this manner, and Lotte’s feelings became more and more melancholy. She felt the extreme difficulty of explaining to her husband, under any circumstances, the weight that lay upon her heart; and her depression became every moment greater, in proportion as she endeavoured to hide her grief, and to conceal her tears.

The arrival of Werther’s servant occasioned her the greatest embarrassment. He gave Albert a note, which the latter coldly handed to his wife, saying, at the same time, “Give him the pistols. I wish him a pleasant journey,” he added, turning to the servant. These words fell upon Lotte like a thunderstroke: she rose from her seat half-fainting, and unconscious of what she did. She walked mechanically toward the wall, took down the pistols with a trembling hand, slowly wiped the dust from them, and would have delayed longer, had not Albert hastened her movements by an impatient look. She then delivered the fatal weapons to the servant, without being able to utter a word. As soon as he had departed, she folded up her work, and retired at once to her room, her heart overcome with the most fearful forebodings. She anticipated some dreadful calamity. She was at one moment on the point of going to her husband, throwing herself at his feet, and acquainting him with all that had happened on the previous evening, that she might acknowledge her fault, and explain her apprehensions; then she saw that such a step would be useless, as she would certainly be unable to induce Albert to visit Werther. Dinner was served; and a kind friend whom she had persuaded to remain assisted to sustain the conversation, which was carried on by a sort of compulsion, till the events of the morning were forgotten.

When the servant brought the pistols to Werther, the latter received them with transports of delight upon hearing that Lotte had given them to him with her own hand. He ate some bread, drank some wine, sent his servant to dinner, and then sat down to write as follows:

They have been in your hands you wiped the dust from them. I kiss them a thousand times—you have touched them. Yes, Heaven favours my design, and you, Lotte, provide me with the fatal instruments. It was my desire to receive my death from your hands, and my wish is gratified. I have made inquiries of my servant. You trembled when you gave him the pistols, but you bade me no adieu. Wretched, wretched that I am—not one farewell! How could you shut your heart against me in that hour which makes you mine for ever? Lotte, ages cannot efface the impression—I feel you cannot hate the man who so passionately loves you!

After dinner he called his servant, desired him to finish the packing up, destroyed many papers, and then went out to pay some trifling debts. He soon returned home, then went out again, notwithstanding the rain, walked for some time in the count’s garden, and afterward proceeded farther into the country. Toward evening he came back once more, and resumed his writing.

Wilhelm, I have for the last time beheld the mountains, the forests, and the sky. Farewell! And you, my dearest mother, forgive me! Console her, Wilhelm. God bless you! I have settled all my affairs! Farewell! We shall meet again, and be happier than ever.

I have requited you badly, Albert; but you will forgive me. I have disturbed the peace of your home. I have sowed distrust between you. Farewell! I will end all this wretchedness. And oh, that my death may render you happy! Albert, Albert! make that angel happy, and the blessing of Heaven be upon you!

He spent the rest of the evening in arranging his papers: he tore and burned a great many; others he sealed up, and directed to Wilhelm. They contained some detached thoughts and maxims, some of which I have perused. At ten o’clock he ordered his fire to be made up, and a bottle of wine to be brought to him. He then dismissed his servant, whose room, as well as the apartments of the rest of the family, was situated in another part of the house. The servant lay down without undressing, that he might be the sooner ready for his journey in the morning, his master having informed him that the post-horses would be at the door before six o’clock.





PAST ELEVEN!


All is silent around me, and my soul is calm. I thank thee, O God, that thou bestowest strength and courage upon me in these last moments! I approach the window, my dearest of friends; and through the clouds, which are at this moment driven rapidly along by the impetuous winds, I behold the stars which illumine the eternal heavens. No, you will not fall, celestial bodies: the hand of the Almighty supports both you and me! I have looked for the last time upon the constellation of the Greater Bear: it is my favourite star; for when I bade you farewell at night, Lotte, and turned my steps from your door, it always shone upon me. With what rapture have I at times beheld it! How often have I implored it with uplifted hands to witness my felicity! and even still—But what object is there, Lotte, which fails to summon up your image before me? Do you not surround me on all sides? and have I not, like a child, treasured up every trifle which you have consecrated by your touch?

Your profile, which was so dear to me, I return to you; and I pray you to preserve it. Thousands of kisses have I imprinted upon it, and a thousand times has it gladdened my heart on departing from and returning to my home.

I have implored your father to protect my remains. At the corner of the churchyard, looking toward the fields, there are two lime-trees—there I wish to lie. Your father can, and doubtless will, do this much for his friend. Implore it of him. But perhaps pious Christians will not choose that their bodies should be buried near the corpse of a poor, unhappy wretch like me. Then let me be laid in some remote valley, or near the highway, where the priest and Levite may bless themselves as they pass by my tomb, whilst the Samaritan will shed a tear for my fate.

See, Lotte, I do not shudder to take the cold and fatal cup, from which I shall drink the draught of death. Your hand presents it to me, and I do not tremble. All, all is now concluded: the wishes and the hopes of my existence are fulfilled. With cold, unflinching hand I knock at the brazen portals of Death. Oh, that I had enjoyed the bliss of dying for you! how gladly would I have sacrificed myself for you; Lotte! And could I but restore peace and joy to your bosom, with what resolution, with what joy, would I not meet my fate! But it is the lot of only a chosen few to shed their blood for their friends, and by their death to augment, a thousand times, the happiness of those by whom they are beloved.

I wish, Lotte, to be buried in the dress I wear at present: it has been rendered sacred by your touch. I have begged this favour of your father. My spirit soars above my sepulchre. I do not wish my pockets to be searched. The knot of pink ribbon which you wore on your bosom the first time I saw you, surrounded by the children— Oh, kiss them a thousand times for me, and tell them the fate of their unhappy friend! I think I see them playing around me. The dear children! How warmly have I been attached to you, Lotte! Since the first hour I saw you, how impossible have I found it to leave you. This ribbon must be buried with me: it was a present from you on my birthday. How confused it all appears! Little did I then think that I should journey this road. But peace! I pray you, peace!

They are loaded—the clock strikes twelve. I say amen. Lotte, Lotte! farewell, farewell!

A neighbour saw the flash, and heard the report of the pistol; but, as everything remained quiet, he thought no more of it.

In the morning, at six o’clock, the servant went into Werther’s room with a candle. He found his master stretched upon the floor, weltering in his blood, and the pistols at his side. He called, he took him in his arms, but received no answer. Life was not yet quite extinct. The servant ran for a surgeon, and then went to fetch Albert. Lotte heard the ringing of the bell: a cold shudder seized her. She wakened her husband, and they both rose. The servant, bathed in tears faltered forth the dreadful news. Lotte fell senseless at Albert’s feet.

When the surgeon came to the unfortunate Werther, he was still lying on the floor; and his pulse beat, but his limbs were cold. The bullet, entering the forehead, over the right eye, had penetrated the skull. A vein was opened in his right arm: the blood came, and he still continued to breathe.

From the blood which flowed from the chair, it could be inferred that he had committed the rash act sitting at his bureau, and that he afterward fell upon the floor. He was found lying on his back near the window. He was in full-dress costume.

The house, the neighbourhood, and the whole town were immediately in commotion. Albert arrived. They had laid Werther on the bed: his head was bound up, and the paleness of death was upon his face. His limbs were motionless; but he still breathed, at one time strongly, then weaker— his death was momently expected.

He had drunk only one glass of the wine. Emilia Galotti lay open upon his bureau.

I shall say nothing of Albert’s distress, or of Lotte’s grief.

The old steward hastened to the house immediately upon hearing the news: he embraced his dying friend amid a flood of tears. His eldest boys soon followed him on foot. In speechless sorrow they threw themselves on their knees by the bedside, and kissed his hands and face. The eldest, who was his favourite, hung over him till he expired; and even then he was removed by force. At twelve o’clock Werther breathed his last. The presence of the steward, and the precautions he had adopted, prevented a disturbance; and that night, at the hour of eleven, he caused the body to be interred in the place which Werther had selected for himself.

The steward and his sons followed the corpse to the grave. Albert was unable to accompany them. Lotte’s life was despaired of. The body was carried by labourers. No priest attended.
