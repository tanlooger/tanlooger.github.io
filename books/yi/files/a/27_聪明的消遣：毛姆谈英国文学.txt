译序并毛姆小传


一八七四年，威廉·萨默塞特·毛姆出生于巴黎，父亲是英国驻法国使馆的律师，母亲是巴黎社交界的名人，据说是个美女，也写作，因此家里爱举办文学沙龙。小说家莫泊桑和版画家、插画家古斯塔夫·多雷都曾是他家的座上客。毛姆八岁时，母亲死于肺结核，从此毛姆终生都把母亲的照片放在床头以表怀念。肺结核是十九世纪的不治之症，二十世纪上半叶也还有无数人死于此病，如著名作家凯瑟琳·曼斯菲尔德和劳伦斯。毛姆也得过肺结核，因此“一战”期间到苏格兰疗养了两年，但他自言“非常享受他的疾病”，因为他爱那病中的孤寂和他病房大窗外的璀璨的星空。

一八八四年，毛姆的父亲死于癌症，十岁的毛姆成了孤儿，生活仅依赖一百五十镑的年金，因此只好回英国和没有孩子的叔叔婶婶同住。他叔叔是个教区牧师，在肯特郡海边怀特斯德布地区的万圣教堂任职，为人冷淡，被他抚养的日子并不好过。进坎特伯雷国王学校后，毛姆的日子仍不好过，在学校里颇受欺负，部分原因是那时他只会说法语。紧张和难过造成毛姆终生口吃，同时也使他养成了一个习惯：对那些惹他不高兴的人，他很会说伤害他们的话。十六岁时他终于拒绝再上国王学校，转而跑去德国的海德堡大学学了一年文学、哲学和德语。

他家是律师世家。毛姆祖父是英格兰与威尔士律师协会的创建人之一，父亲是律师，三个哥哥也都是著名律师，大哥后来更是做了英国上议院的大法官。可是毛姆不想当律师，他也不想当牧师，口吃本也无法布道。他还不想当公务员，当时他叔叔认为公务员已经不再是个绅士职业，于是他学了医。他进了伦敦南部贫民窟兰贝斯的圣托马斯医院的医学院，学了五年，这所学校如今成了伦敦国王学院的一部分。毛姆当住院医生时接生过六十三个孩子，但是拿到医生资格后却从未行过医，因为当时（一八九七年）他的处女作《兰贝斯的丽莎》出版了。小说基于他在贫民窟和医院的行医见闻，描写了工人阶级的痛苦、疾病，以及他们对爱情的绝望追求。《兰贝斯的丽莎》和左拉的《娜娜》、斯蒂芬·克莱恩的《街头女郎玛吉》以及乔治·吉辛的《新寒士街》一样用自然主义手法写成。书在几周内售罄，证明颇为成功，于是毛姆彻底放弃行医，全职写作。他自言“我写作如鸭入水”。有人说这段学医的经历于他的写作事业无益，毛姆却说：“我见过人如何死亡，如何忍受疼痛，我见过希望什么样，恐惧和放松又是什么样。”

接下来的十年间，毛姆游历了伦敦、巴黎、西班牙的塞维利亚和意大利南部的卡普里岛，旅行和写作成了他终生的模式。但他这一阶段的作品不再有《兰贝斯的丽莎》的成功，直到一九〇七年他的戏剧《弗里德里克夫人》上演。次年，毛姆更是有四部戏同时上演，以至于《笨拙》杂志都刊登了一幅漫画，画中莎士比亚一边咬指甲一边紧张地看着有毛姆戏剧的布告牌。今人只以为毛姆是名小说家，其实他的戏剧一样成功。

“一战”爆发时毛姆已是著名作家，早过了征兵年龄，因此他加入了红十字会“文学救护车司机队”，去法国服务。这支队伍由二十四位著名作家组成，包括美国作家多斯·帕索斯、海明威和诗人E．E．卡明斯。毛姆在敦刻尔克附近开救护车的间隙里校对了《人生的枷锁》的出版校样。此书被公认为毛姆的代表作，起初名叫“斯蒂芬·凯利的艺术气质”，也想过叫“灰烬中的美”，具自传色彩，主人公菲利普·凯利是个孤儿，一个足部畸形的医学生，由他虔诚的叔叔抚养长大。之所以写《人生的枷锁》，毛姆自言是因为从前那些记忆让他不安，记忆变成了折磨。为了祛魅，为了从那些令他难以忍受的执念中解脱出来，他写了两年，还不介意书越写越长。写完后他认为那些鬼魂都被他打倒了，那些人和事将不会再出现。没想到三十年后当他为一家唱片公司朗读此书将之录音时，却又一次忍不住崩溃痛哭起来，导致音也没录成。

一九一五年《人生的枷锁》出版，起初英美批评界都不看好，《纽约世界》说凯利的浪漫执着是“一个可怜傻瓜的感伤奴性”。美国作家、《嘉莉妹妹》的作者德莱塞挽救了它，说此书是天才之作，将它与贝多芬的交响乐作比，从此这书才长销不衰起来，并且再未断卖。《人生的枷锁》书名源于斯宾诺莎《伦理学》第四部分“关于人生的枷锁，或情感的力量”的小标题，对此斯宾诺莎有如此题解：“我管人类没有能力控制或约束情感叫作枷锁，受情感控制的人不是自己的主人。”

作家身份据说是情报工作的最好掩护，加之情报工作具有吸引毛姆的“浪漫感和滑稽感”，因此“一战”时毛姆被英国情报部门录用，一九一五年去了瑞士开展工作，旨在对抗德国。一九一七年六月，他又被军情六处派去俄国执行秘密任务，目的是想维持临时政府的统治。但是仅仅两个半月后，布尔什维克就掌了权。毛姆说他如果能早到六个月，他就很有可能成功。真如此，则十月革命不会有，世界上第一个社会主义国家不会有。一个小说家的话真实性有多大，姑妄听之。不过毛姆为人安静，敏于观察，有一种冷静判断的天赋，还有一种不被表象欺骗的能力（他认为这点继承自他的律师父亲），使他觉得自己适合做情报工作。这段经历后来被他写进了短篇小说集《英国间谍阿兴登》（一九二八年），文学史上因此第一次有了一个老练、淡漠的绅士型间谍。这个人物的刻画据说后来影响了伊安·弗莱明的零零七，弗莱明更是明言《量子危机》就是为了向毛姆的文风致敬。《英国间谍阿兴登》是个反浪漫的间谍故事，类似约翰·勒卡雷的《柏林谍影》，而非约翰·巴肯的《三十九级台阶》。

毛姆是个世界旅行者。一九一六年他去南太平洋的塔希提岛为小说《月亮与六便士》（一九一九年）搜集素材，写一个股票经纪人如何放弃欧洲、放弃家庭，追寻自然与艺术的事，事迹影射法国画家高更。一九二二年出版的《在中国屏风上》是一部短篇随笔集，写的是毛姆在中国的旅行见闻。《面纱》（一九二五年）描述了一个女人在爱情与婚姻中的自我成长，因书中写到在香港的英国人这一群体，毛姆至少改了两次，删去了一些人物，以免被当时仍住在香港的一些人误会写的是自己。《客厅里的绅士》（一九三〇年）写的是毛姆在缅甸、暹罗（泰国）、柬埔寨和越南的游历。以一个中国仆人命名的《阿金》（一九三三年）也是一本以毛姆二十世纪二十年代游历东南亚的见闻为素材写的短篇小说集。这些书中描写了殖民主义在印度、中国、东南亚和太平洋的最后时光。终于，倦游了的毛姆在一九二六年买下了位于法属里维埃拉的费拉角的摩尔别墅，这里成了他的家。除了“二战”那些年的漂泊，他在这里一直住到死。他广邀朋友来此，摩尔别墅因此成了二十世纪二三十年代欧美最大的文学沙龙之一。一九四〇年法国战败后毛姆离开里维埃拉，在美国度过了“二战”的大部分时间。他开始在好莱坞编剧本，他是最早从电影改编中挣了大钱的作家之一，仅短篇小说《雨》就拍了三次。

感情方面，毛姆应该是个双性恋者，因为他曾结婚生女，但又有两个长期的同性伴侣。第一个延续了三十年，直至对方去世；第二个维系了二十年，直至毛姆去世。毛姆在印度、中国、东南亚、太平洋的游历全都有第一位的陪伴，那人在伴侣之外，还是个能干的秘书。不过毛姆自觉爱情生活从来不顺，他承认：“我爱的人一般都不爱我，有人爱我时，我又觉得尴尬……为了不伤害这些人的感情，我经常表演我根本没有的激情。”

毛姆在世时，同性恋被广泛认为是道德缺陷和非法行为，加之一八九五年对王尔德的审判及其入狱造成的震动太大，毛姆终生未公开自己的性向。有评论家认为同性情结在毛姆身上产生了一种矛盾效果。一方面，不知是他的性向令自己难堪，还是他故意遮掩，总之他对同性恋艺术家从无好评。他说：“不可否认，同性恋的世界观较常人狭隘。人类在某些方面的自然反应他没有。至少人类的某些普通、典型的情感他永远无法体验。不管他如何微妙地看待生活，他都无法完整地看待生活……如今我禁不住要问我自己，我在格列柯的画作中看到的那种受折磨的幻想和邪恶的怪异感是否就是这样的性变态所致。”格列柯指的是十六世纪的那位西班牙画家。另一方面，毛姆常常赋予他的女性人物时代少见的性欲，《兰贝斯的丽莎》、《寻欢作乐》、《面纱》和《刀锋》里都有一个不计后果、决心要满足自己性欲的女主人公。

冷淡疏远大概是毛姆性格的最大特色，家人看不透他，五十年的友谊也不能使朋友明白他。有评论者认为这种冷淡疏远是毛姆精心营造的一个恶作剧，一重假面具，一层保护色。道德家和感伤者说他的作品中有太多不必要的残酷、暴力和复仇，说他对恶太宽容，太不加批判。毛姆自己也说，的确，别人的罪恶很少影响到他，除非妨碍到了他个人。曾为他作传的一个侄子说毛姆家族有种英国中上阶层的尊严感。终其一生，毛姆都不觉得作家是个体面职业，再加上他同性恋的隐秘身份，他跟侄子说他觉得自己“四分之三不正常，只有四分之一正常”。这种气质一定影响到了他作品的精神气质：在表面的见多识广和精于世故之下总是涌动着一股紧张和焦虑的暗流。

毛姆极其多产。他著有长篇小说二十部，短篇小说约一百篇，剧本约三十个，此外尚有多种游记、回忆录和文艺评论。他的书几乎全都大卖，《人生的枷锁》和《刀锋》被公认为他的代表作，生前就卖了四千万册。他的戏剧上演后也很成功，还有一长串的电影改编，再加上精明的股票投资，他无疑是作家中的富豪，二十世纪三十年代收入最高的英国作家，光是短篇小说《雨》就让他赚了百万美元。但在写作质量上，他却从未能从批评家和同代人那里赢得最高级别的尊重。毛姆认为这是因为自己“没有抒情素质，词汇量小，我想扩大我的词汇量，可是试过什么办法都没用。我没有暗喻的天赋，也很难弄出新颖的、令人震惊的明喻”。如此自知，作家中不多见。福克纳、托马斯·曼、乔伊斯和伍尔夫走红时，毛姆也曾一度尝试现代主义的写作手法，但他平淡朴实的文风却招致“连篇累牍的陈词滥调，最后不禁令人感叹作者说废话的能力和不会表达个性的无能”的批评。能这么勇于革新又敢于这么现眼，也是种可爱。

在文学价值上，《人生的枷锁》被认为无法和同时期乔伊斯的《一个青年艺术家的肖像》或劳伦斯的《儿子与情人》相比。毛姆自嘲他是那种“一招鲜，吃遍天”的人，晚年还说自己也就能“在二流作家里坐到最前排”。曾有批评家将他与萨克雷、纪德、哈代、康拉德、阿诺德·班尼特和高尔斯华绥并列，这实在不妥。又有人认为毛姆应该和班尼特、奥尔德斯·赫胥黎、格雷厄姆·格林并列，但这似乎也还是不妥。总之，无论怎样给作家排序都很难合了每个人的意。

美国作家、批评家埃德蒙·威尔逊说毛姆是个“半垃圾的小说家，写得很差，但是受到不怎么严肃的、基本不在乎写作的读者的追捧”。这话非常狠，也不公平，因为后世有很多很在乎写作的作家都给了毛姆很高的评价。张爱玲曾多次谈到她嗜读毛姆，对之念念不忘。公认非常严肃、非常有内涵的乔治·奥威尔说毛姆是对他影响最大的现代作家，他最欣赏毛姆直截了当、毫不做作的讲故事的能力。美国畅销书作家斯蒂芬·金也称赞毛姆讲故事的能力。英国作家安东尼·伯吉斯的小说《尘世权力》（一九八〇年）的主人公更是以毛姆作为原型。

不管同行和批评家的意见是褒是贬，毛姆在普通读者那里一直都很受欢迎。他不是个复杂难读的作家，行文没有冗长的感伤，用词简约，文风生动，充满讽刺。换句话说，他的作品可读性强，读者只要拿起他的作品就会放不下。即使读者觉得写得最不好的作品，比如《卡特琳娜》，也还是有人认为自有其趣。毛姆还有一个优点是，虽然他的不少小说故事都发生在外国，但他对异国情调把握得很好，并不显摆外国名字，也不像有些作家那样对异国风俗表现出一种炫耀式的熟悉。

现在该谈谈毛姆的文学评论了。西方学界普遍认为毛姆的文学批评不够好，太过“常识”，讲作家生平多于分析作品，好读但易忘。说的都对，可是生逢一个后理论时代，读多了那些披着理论外衣、充满难词术语的学院派著作，读者会禁不住怀疑这些评论其实根本就不关乎文学，也偏离了文学批评的初衷。在这种情况下再读写于二十世纪三十到五十年代的毛姆的文学批评，会发现他的坦荡率真，毫无包袱。毛姆最大的优点有两个，一是从“人”的角度体贴作者和人物，知道他们并非完人，只是会犯错的人类，于是不故意美化菲尔丁为不酗酒胡闹、不背叛妻子的道德先生，还能依据社会史还原奥斯汀的“不文雅”，指出她重道德完善和良好教养的个人原因，这是对目前早被庞大的文化工业“神化”了的奥斯汀的“祛魅”，于读者而言是个有益的提醒。他还反对传记作者和评论家对勃朗特家悲惨生活的一贯渲染，认为约克郡的气候和风景自有可爱之处，牧师的收入也没有少到不能维持体面生活的地步。二是毛姆能从作家的角度看作家，不强为作家圆谎，比如他不附和萨克雷认为菲尔丁在写作《汤姆·琼斯》之前就已经有了全局规划的观点，反而指出菲尔丁每章前的引言纯属蛇足，书中的几处情节也很多余。至于他对艾米莉·勃朗特是同性恋因而导致《呼啸山庄》独特构思的阐发，结合他自己隐秘的同性恋历史，大概很难定论其背后的真实态度。读者不妨姑妄读之听之。

毛姆的文学评论之所以好读，除他自身原因外，还因为最初发表时，这些评论都刊载在报刊之上，面向“普通读者”，没有高深的必要。《总结》（一九三八年）可算是毛姆的文学自传，写的是他从一八九〇年到一九三八年的生活，包括童年、初登剧坛时的成功，以及如何从写戏剧转向写小说。这是本充满隽语的小书。小薄书《书与你》（一九四〇年）是毛姆为《星期六晚邮报》所作的三篇文章的合集。《作家笔记》（一九四九年）记录了毛姆五十年间的观察与思考，展示了毛姆很多作品发生发展的过程。《随性而至》（一九五三年）是六篇文章的合集，其中既有对康德的探讨，也有对侦探小说的评论。《十本小说及其作者》（一九五四年）是毛姆为《红皮书》杂志所作文章的合集，是他对他心目中最伟大的十本小说及其作者的评论。此处不妨全体列举出来，以示毛姆在文学上的品位与判断：菲尔丁的《汤姆·琼斯》，奥斯汀的《傲慢与偏见》，司汤达的《红与黑》，巴尔扎克的《高老头》，狄更斯的《大卫·科波菲尔》，福楼拜的《包法利夫人》，麦尔维尔的《白鲸》，艾米莉·勃朗特的《呼啸山庄》，陀思妥耶夫斯基的《卡拉马佐夫兄弟》，以及托尔斯泰的《战争与和平》。（《十本小说及其作者》一书在美国有个版本叫《小说的艺术》，中译名多作《巨匠与杰作》。）《观点：五篇文章》（一九五九年），内容同毛姆之前的批评合集一样多样。

以上几乎涵盖了毛姆的所有文学批评。这些书全有中译本，有的还不止一个版本，不过各版本内容不尽相同，有时文字出入还很大。有的因译者有意节选，有的则因译文所本的原文本就不同。这也说明毛姆的文字虽然看似平实流畅，好像随笔写来，但其实大约每次出版前都会再增删修改一番。既然珠玉在前，本译本不再针对某本书进行翻译。又因为迄今为止还未有一部译著将毛姆谈英国文学的文字系统整理成书，因此本书从英国文学的角度选取篇目，不再关注美国文学和欧陆文学。虽然旨在补缺，但为完整计，本书有一编选原则，即片段不选，如讲散文的部分（散见于毛姆写十七世纪末坎特伯雷大主教蒂洛森的文章）不选；只讲作家不讲作品，或主讲作家少讲作品的也不选，如写阿诺德·班尼特、H．G．威尔斯和凯瑟琳·曼斯菲尔德的文章不选。

因此本书包括常见的《书与你》的第一篇，作为毛姆对英国文学的概论，也包括《十本小说及其作者》中的《汤姆·琼斯》、《傲慢与偏见》、《大卫·科波菲尔》和《呼啸山庄》四篇，还包括一篇国内迄今未有翻译但其实非常重要的“吉卜林与其短篇小说”，以及两篇迄今也未有翻译但也同样重要的毛姆为个人两卷本短篇小说全集所作的序。毛姆在这两篇序言中不仅谈了他的短篇小说创作，也谈了莫泊桑和契诃夫对他的影响。就这两大短篇小说流派在英语文学中的发展而言，一般认为凯瑟琳·曼斯菲尔德代表契诃夫一派，毛姆则代表莫泊桑一派。

关于后三篇，即谈吉卜林的一篇和两篇短篇小说的自序，均收录于一九六三年美国阿诺出版社出版的一个名为《毛姆序言与导言选集》的合集中。顾名思义，此书所选都是毛姆为自己文集或别人文集所作的序，其中颇有一些中国学界以前没太注意的毛姆的散佚文字。其中由毛姆自序的短篇小说全集是他众多短篇小说选集中的标定本，意义自不必说。吉卜林一篇是毛姆为《吉卜林散文选》（一九五二年）所作的序。所谓“散文”，在英文中的概念是指非“韵文”，即非诗歌的文体，并非中文理解的“散文”，在《吉卜林散文选》中实则指短篇小说。毛姆为此书编选了若干他认为重要的吉卜林短篇小说，在序中说明了编选原则，并对吉卜林的小说成就做出了评价。

在编排顺序上，《书与你》是对英国文学的概述，理当位列第一，五篇谈作家（菲尔丁、奥斯汀、狄更斯、艾米莉·勃朗特和吉卜林）作品的文章则按所涉作家的生年排列，最后两篇自序写于毛姆人生末年，语气也有盖棺论定之意，因此位列最后。

本书书名《聪明的消遣》来自毛姆自语，是他对小说功用的总结。通读此书的读者还会发现毛姆其他一些被不断提及的想法：人生在世，不如读书；不爱读文学无可指摘，谁也没有义务必须读文学，读文学也没有一定之法，但是要读就读那些“有益有趣”的作品。“益”“趣”并重的提法似乎有些矛盾，因为在“益”“趣”二者间，毛姆更倾向于“趣”。他直言作家不是教师，不是牧师，而是艺术家。可他所读之人和所介绍之书又都无出西方正典之外的，说明他的品位其实还是最正统、最正确的。如果说作为译者的我对毛姆的文学批评有任何失望之处，那就是除了希望他的批评能多些洞察外，还能多表露一些他真实的个人癖好和当代趣味。

《书与你》第一篇


一个人说话时，经常不注意。我在一本名为《总结》的书里说，年轻人经常问我应该读什么书好。我当时没有考虑说这话的后果，可是此后我就收到了各色人等的大量来信，问我给了什么建议。虽然我对来信尽量作答，但这事无法在私信中说清，再加上似乎有很多人希望得到指导，那么我想我不如从自身经历出发，简要陈述一下我的建议，让读者能够读一些既有趣又有益的书。

我想强调的第一件事是，读书应是令人享受的。当然有很多书是我们不得不读的，或为通过考试，或为获取信息，但是读那类书无法获得快乐。读它们是为了获取知识，我们至多能期待的就是坚持把书读完，且不觉得厌倦，谁让我们有需求呢。在读那些书时，我们是抱着不得不读，而不是喜欢去读的心态，但这不是我想谈的那种读书。以下我将提到的书既无法帮你获得学位、赚钱谋生，也不能教你驾驶船只，或使熄火的马达重新转动起来，但它们能使你活得更充实。不过，如果你不喜欢读那些书，它们也无法使你充实。

我这里说的“你”是指成年人，是那些工作之余有一定闲暇并想读读书的人，而且，他想读的书是那类如果不读会让他觉得很可惜的书。我说的“你”不是“书虫”，“书虫”自可在书山中找到自己的一条路，他的好奇心会引他走上很多乏人问津的幽僻蹊径，自会在寻得几乎被人遗忘了的好书时收获乐趣。我想谈论的仅是那些“杰作”，那些长久以来被人们一致认为至高无上的作品。那些杰出的作品我们本应都读过，但可惜，其实只有少数人读过。有些杰作得到过最好的评论家们的一致认可，文学史家也曾花过相当篇幅对之进行讨论，但如今普通人已经无法读之乐之了。这类作品对研究者而言很重要，但是时代在变化，人们的品味在变化，书中滋味早已被剥夺殆尽，如今再读它们不靠意志力则难以卒读了。且让我略举一例。我曾读过乔治·艾略特的《亚当·比德》，但我无法以手扪心，说我读时愉快。我本就出于责任感而读，读完时我长出了一口气，庆幸自己终于读完了。

对于这类书，我不想置词。每个人都是最好的评论家。不管学者们如何评价一本书，哪怕他们对它一致称颂，但只要你对这本书不感兴趣，那它也与你无关。不要忘了批评家们也经常犯错，评论史也充满了最知名的评论家们所犯的错，读书的你才是你所读之书价值的最终评判者。这一点自然也适用于我将要给你推荐的书。我们人人不同，只是大略相像，因此不必假设对我有意义的书对你也会如此。不过，我读完这些书后感到充实，假如我没读过它们，我就不会是现在的我了。如果你们中有人因为听了我的话，而去读我推荐的书，却又无法卒读，那么我恳请你们，就放下它吧。一本书，你要是不喜欢读，就不会对你有任何用处。没有人有义务去读诗、读小说，或读我们归类为“美文”(1)（我希望我知道这个词的英文，但我不认为有这么一个英文词）的那类作品。人只需为了乐趣读书。谁能肯定地说，能给一个人带来乐趣的，也必能让另一个人觉得有趣？

但是切勿以为享受乐趣是不道德的。乐趣本是一大善，所有乐趣都如此，只是它会造成不同的后果，理智者会刻意避开某些乐事。乐趣也无须粗俗或肉欲。那些懂得“智识之乐”最令人满足和最长久之人是一代人中的智者。人生在世，不如养成读书的习惯，那会让你受益匪浅。盛年之后，只有不多的几项消遣能令你满意。游戏中只有单人纸牌、解象棋残局和填字游戏是你无须对手就可以独自玩耍的。读书却无此不便，它是唯一一桩可以随时拿起，想做多久就做多久，有其他事来时又可以随时放下的事情。除此之外，大概只有针黹之事有同样功效，不过做针线会使焦躁不安的情绪越发焦躁。在如今有了公共图书馆和廉价版图书的幸福日子里，没有其他娱乐能像读书这样可以如此低价地获得。养成读书习惯等于给自己构筑了一个避难所，可以让你逃离人世间几乎所有的苦难。我说“几乎所有”，是因为我不假装读书能缓解饥饿的折磨，或减轻单相思的痛苦。但是，几本令人入迷的侦探小说和一个热水瓶足可以使任何人忽略最严重的伤风。相反，如果一个人被迫去读那些令他厌烦的书，他还怎么能养成为阅读而阅读的习惯呢？

为方便起见，以下我将按时间顺序谈一下我要谈的书，可是如果你决定要读这些书的话，我却觉得你没有必要按此顺序去读。更好的建议是你爱怎么读就怎么读，我甚至觉得你没必要一本接一本地读。就我个人而言，同时读四五本书才更惬意。毕竟，你每天心境不同，即使是一天内，你也不是总抱着一样的急切感去读一本书。在这些事上随意即可，我当然选择最适合我的方案。于是上午开始工作前，我会先读一会儿科学或哲学书，因为读此类书要求头脑清醒、注意力集中。这样开始有助于我一天的工作。接下来工作做完，我感觉放松，却又不想做劳心费力之事时，我会读点历史、散文、评论或自传，晚上则读小说。除此之外，我手边还总有一卷诗，以便有心情之时展卷。我的床头也总放着一本那种难得一遇的书，哦，就是那种可以随意翻开一处，任意读上一段又可以平静放下的书。

言归正传。我书单上的第一本书是笛福的《摩尔·弗兰德斯》。迄今为止，还没有一个英国作家比笛福写得更逼真。当你读他这本书的时候，你很难想起来自己是在读小说，你更像是在读一份写得精湛至极的报告。你确信他书中人物说的话是他们本来就会说的话，他们做的事也合情合理，你毫不怀疑他们在那种情况下一定会如此表现。《摩尔·弗兰德斯》不是一本符合道德准则的书。其内容驳杂、粗俗、野蛮，但我认为它有一种英国人性格里固有的活力。笛福几乎没有想象力，也不够幽默，但他有着宽广丰富的生活经历。他还是个优秀的记者，他对稀奇事和生动的细节有着敏锐的观察力。笛福没有高潮观念，也不试图构建什么模式，因此读者不会被自己不想抵抗的力量裹挟席卷，他会随波逐流一直向前走，可能当他来到一条小巷时，他就会溜进去走掉了。说得更清楚一点就是，写得一样的东西读完两三百页后，读者会厌倦。这其实没什么不好。就我个人而言，我倒是很愿意陪着作者一路前行，直到他最后给他那下流粗鄙的女主人公找到一个体面的、悔悟后的避难所。

之后，我希望诸君读读斯威夫特的《格列佛游记》。我待会儿再讲约翰逊博士，但此处不妨先引用他对此书的评价：“你只要能想得出大人国和小人国来，其他就都好办了。”约翰逊博士是个极好的批评家，极富智慧，但他这话却是胡说。《格列佛游记》里有机智和反讽，独特的构思，出色的幽默，以及辛辣的讽刺和活力。它的风格很妙。没人能比斯威夫特更会紧凑、清晰、自然地驾驭我们国家的这门笨拙的语言了。我希望约翰逊博士评价斯威夫特能像他评价另一个人一样：“不管是谁，只要想获得一种亲切但不粗俗、文雅但不炫耀的英文写作风格，须得日夜研读艾迪生(2)的作品。”他还可以再加上一组形容词：刚健但不自负。

接下来是两本小说。菲尔丁的《汤姆·琼斯》，这本小说大概是英国文学里最健康的一本小说了。此书豪爽、勇敢、欢快，当然也很直率。英俊、活泼、人很友好的汤姆·琼斯是我们大家都想结识的人，但他做的某些事却遭到了卫道士的谴责。但是我们在乎吗？当然不！除非我们是一本正经的道学家。因为我们只知道汤姆·琼斯公正无私，他的心是金子做的。菲尔丁和笛福不同，他是个自觉的艺术家。他对小说的规划让他可以描述很多事，创造很多人物。这些人和事在一个因现实的喧哗与骚动而辛辣尖锐的世界里显得那么壮观和真实。菲尔丁很拿自己当回事——当然每个作家都理应如此——在很多重要问题上他都禁不住要发表看法。《汤姆·琼斯》的每部分开头处他都要写个小评论文，讨论点这事那事。这些评论文有其幽默真诚的一面，但我个人认为跳过不读也不会造成损失。我有个想法，觉得没有人读《汤姆·琼斯》会不感到愉悦，因为它充满男子气概，它阳光健康，毫无虚伪矫饰，能温暖你的心灵。

斯特恩的《项狄传》性质则完全不同。约翰逊博士对《查尔斯·格兰迪森爵士》(3)的看法可以照搬给它：“如果你读它是为了故事情节，那还不如上吊。”读这本书要看你的性情，它可以非常通俗易懂，也可以非常无聊和做作。它不统一，不连贯，不断跑题，但它新颖、有趣、哀婉。它会增加你的精神财富，因为书中有五六个人物极有个性，非常可爱；你一旦认识了他们，就会觉得要是不认识他们，损失将会不可弥补。我也不希望你错过斯特恩的《多情之旅》，除了迷人之外我对它没有别的评价。

现在让我们暂别小说，说说别的。我猜世人公认鲍斯威尔的《塞缪尔·约翰逊传》是英语写成的最伟大的传记。你在任何年纪读此书都会觉得既有益又有趣。任何时候你拿起此书，随意翻到哪一页读起，都能得到娱乐。不过时至今日还要夸赞这样一本已经很著名的书不免可笑，因为实在没有必要。不如让我加上一本不太著名的书，我认为此书不为人所知是不公平的。这就是鲍斯威尔的《赫布里底群岛(4)纪行》。我猜大家都知道，鲍斯威尔的手稿本来是马隆编辑的，而马隆为了迎合时代拘谨的文雅品味，删去了很多令此书有趣的东西。而伊沙姆上校在购买了鲍斯威尔的手稿后，出了一个未删节的新版本，这一版本会让你对约翰逊和鲍斯威尔的了解更加深入。如果说《赫布里底群岛纪行》增添了你对那个刚毅的老博士的爱和崇拜，它也一样会增添你对他那个曾受到大肆谩骂攻击的可怜传记作者的尊敬。可是这样一个作者岂容蔑视？他能敏锐地发现有趣的事物，他能欣赏生动的词句，他还有种罕见的天赋：能重现一个场景的气氛，还原一段生动的对话。

约翰逊博士是影响了十八世纪整个英国的人物。他被认为最能代表英国的国民性，既具有那些纯粹的优点，也具有那些不讨喜的缺点。如果说我们都读过鲍斯威尔为他作的传，可能对他的了解会比对很多与我们共度一生的人了解都多，却很少有人读过约翰逊博士自己写的文章。还好，至少他写过一本令人得到至高享受的作品。在我看来，再没有一本书比约翰逊的《诗人传》更适合带去旅行或放在床头了。此书写得流畅、辛辣、幽默，充满常识。虽说有时他的一些看法会令我们吃惊，比如他认为格雷(5)沉闷，对弥尔顿的《利西达斯》也没有好话说，但你仍会乐见其说，因为这些观点是他个性的表达。他对他笔下的诗人和诗作同样感兴趣。那些诗哪怕你一个字都没读过，你一样会被他对诗人敏锐、生动、宽容的描述所娱乐。

接下来的这本书令我有些犹豫。因为我必须提醒读者，我原计划要谈的都是我认为不读会令人遗憾的书。而吉本的这本《自传》我虽喜欢，却不太肯定不读它会对我造成多大影响。如果我没读过这本书一定会失去一份强烈的乐趣，但是如果我在这里提它，我觉得我也必须提别的好多书——那些如果按照另一个标准来衡量，也非常值得一读但算不上经典的书，这些书将需要单独的一章来介绍。无论如何，吉本的《自传》可读性强，篇幅短，既庄重又幽默，行文有一种他所擅长的特殊优雅。我禁不住要举一例说明他的幽默。吉本在洛桑时恋爱了，但他父亲威胁要剥夺他的继承权，他只得谨慎地放弃了娶意中人为妻的想法。他对此事的吟诵是这样结束的：“作为恋人，我叹息；作为儿子，我服从；我的创伤，被时间、分离以及一套新的生活习惯无情地愈合了。”此书哪怕没有别的内容，仅凭这句妙语也值得一读了。

现在我想放弃迄今为止都在大致遵循的时间顺序，谈谈两本伟大的小说：《大卫·科波菲尔》和巴特勒的《众生之道》。我这么做，不仅因为它们在英国长篇小说的伟大传统中占有重要的地位，同时也因为它们具备了英国文学的典型特征，我在上文简要提到的那些作品也都有这些特征。可能除《项狄传》外，所有这些书都有共同之处，如旺盛的活力、坦率、幽默和健康，而我愿意认为这些特征代表了我们的民族性。这些书并无特别微妙之处，也都少了点精致，但这是属于行动者而非思考者的文学，其中有很多常识、一些感伤，以及大量的人性。关于《大卫·科波菲尔》，除了说这是狄更斯最好的小说，还能说什么呢？狄更斯的缺点在这本书里最不明显，优点却最明显。《众生之道》后，又有很多长篇小说问世，我却认为《众生之道》是最后一部用伟大的方式写出的英国小说，是最后一部不受法、俄伟大小说家们影响的重要小说。它是《汤姆·琼斯》的正统继承者，它的作者有一种那个老字典编纂人(6)的气质，而后者，被公认是个典型的英国人。

那么，让我再回过头来谈谈简·奥斯汀。我不会说她是英国最伟大的小说家，狄更斯才是，尽管狄更斯有无数毛病，比如喜欢夸张、粗俗、啰唆，还善感。但他是个有惊人天赋的小说家，他用不同的视角描述我们所知的世界；他创造了一个世界。他把悬念、戏剧性和幽默感运用到他的作品中，如此才让人感受到生活中的百态与忙乱喧闹。据我所知，另外只有一位小说家也做到了这点，那就是托尔斯泰。狄更斯以他无穷的活力塑造出了一系列的人物，他们各式各样，各具个性，每一个都随着生活而颤抖——不，“颤抖”这个词不对，是“动荡”。狄更斯以一种惊人的技巧掌控着他那些复杂的、经常还很不靠谱的故事情节，他竟然还处理得很好；或许只有身为小说家才能彻底理解他的技巧是多么高超。但是奥斯汀代表完美。她的写作范围确实狭小，因为她接触到的是一个由乡绅、牧师和中产阶级构成的小世界。但是，在对人物的洞察上，谁能与她匹敌？在对人物内心的精准与合理的探索上，谁又能超越她？她不需要我的赞美。我唯一想提醒你注意的是她的一个特点，一个她非常自然地在文中运用，以至于你都已经不以为奇的特点。那就是：整体而言，她的小说里一般不发生什么特别重大的社会事件，她也基本避免戏剧性事件的出现，但你仍然会被引诱着读了一页又一页，迫切想知道下边发生了什么（我真不知道她是怎么做到的）。这正是一个小说家最核心的才能。没这个本事，小说家就完了。我想不出还有谁比奥斯汀在这种才能上更圆满。现在，我唯一的难题是要决定在她不多的几本小说里到底推荐哪一本。就我个人而言，我最喜欢《曼斯菲尔德庄园》。我承认它的女主人公是个小假正经，男主人公又是个浮夸的笨蛋，但是我不在乎。因为《曼斯菲尔德庄园》写得机智、诙谐、感人，是一部集反讽的幽默与微妙的观察于一身的杰作。

行文至此，我想请大家注意一下黑兹利特。他的名气被查尔斯·兰姆掩盖了，但在我心目中他才是更好的散文家。兰姆迷人、温柔、机智，认识他就会爱上他，他也一直都能获得读者的欢心。黑兹利特不行，他为人粗鲁笨拙，好嫉妒，好争吵。说实话，他的性格不讨人喜欢。但是不幸的是，能写出最好的书的人并不总是最好的人，关键还是要看艺术家的性格。就我个人而言，我发现使我更感兴趣的是黑兹利特那痛苦、反叛而尖刻的灵魂，而不是兰姆隐忍却易感伤的和善。作为作家，黑兹利特有力、大胆、健康，他想说的话都说得很坚决。他的文章都是“肉”，读完一篇你会觉得像是吃了充实的一餐，满足了胃口。而读兰姆，你只会觉得这顿饭味道不错，做得讲究。黑兹利特最好的作品大都收录在《席间闲谈》中，他的散文也曾几次结集出版，每本选集无一例外都会包括《我与诗人的初相识》。在我看来，此文不仅是他写过的最令人激动的文章，也是英语散文中最好的一篇。

现在要再介绍两本小说：萨克雷的《名利场》和艾米莉·勃朗特的《呼啸山庄》。篇幅不够，我不能说太多了。如今的批评家很爱挑剔萨克雷。他可能是那个时代的不幸者，他应该活在我们这个时代，写在我们这个时代，这样他就可以不受传统的制约，正是那种制约使得维多利亚时代的小说家不敢说出真相，不管这真相在他看来是多么苦涩。萨克雷的视角是现代的，他对人类的平庸深有觉悟，他对人性中的矛盾感兴趣。不管你如何不喜欢他的感伤和说教，如何遗憾他一味向公众的要求妥协时的软弱，有一个事实是无法改变的，那就是他创造的贝姬·夏普是英国小说里最真实、生动、有力的人物之一。

《呼啸山庄》非常独特。这本小说读起来别扭，有时太过出格离奇，会把你完全搞蒙。但它又无比热情激昂，非常动人，具有如同伟大诗篇一般的深度和力度。读《呼啸山庄》不像是在读小说，因为当你读小说时，哪怕再投入，必要时也总能提醒自己这只不过是个编出来的故事；而当你读《呼啸山庄》时，你却好似亲身经历了一场在你的生命中足以摧毁一切的不幸。

篇幅所限，我只能再提三本不读会遗憾的小说。它们是乔治·艾略特的《米德尔马契》、特罗洛普的《尤斯蒂斯钻石》和梅瑞狄斯的《利己主义者》。

读者可能已经惊讶地注意到了，迄今为止我没谈及诗歌。我不认为我们民族产生过能够媲美其他国家的画家、雕塑家和作曲家。虽然我们的绘画、雕塑和作曲的成就不错，却并没到杰出的程度。但是我会说我国的诗人是最优秀的，而且我不认为这是出于民族或国家的偏见。诗歌是文学之花、之冠，诗歌不能平庸。我记得埃德蒙·戈斯(7)跟我说过，他宁可读一卷并不出彩的诗集，也不愿读一本平庸的小说，因为读诗花的时间少，还不费脑子。然而只是押韵的东西却于我无用，不管格律多么无可挑剔。对我而言，诗歌必须伟大，否则就什么都不是，还不如读报纸。我无法随时随地地读诗，我希望处于特定情绪和称心的环境中才去读诗。我喜欢夏日将尽时在花园里读，也喜欢坐在一片能看到海的悬崖上，或是躺在树林里长满青苔的河岸上，然后再把口袋里的诗卷拿出来品读。可是哪怕最伟大的诗人也写过很多冗长乏味的诗，还有很多写诗者虽然创作出卷帙无数，最后能拿得出手的诗作却只有两三篇。虽然我认为这两三首已经足够证明诗人存在的合理性了，但我不想收获这么少而读那么多。我喜欢诗选。我知道评论家们对诗选嗤之以鼻，他们说想要了解一个作者必须读他的全集。但我不是一个评论家，而是一个普通人，我读诗只是因为需要慰藉、恢复活力和获得平静。我感谢那些感觉敏锐的学者，正是他们不避烦劳，从体量庞大的英国诗歌中去粗取精，才选出了适合我需要的读物。我读过的三本最好的诗选是帕尔格雷夫主编的《英诗金库》、牛津出版社的《牛津英诗选》，以及杰拉尔德·布利特选编的《英国短诗荟萃》。不过，我们既然生活在当今世界中，就不该忽视当代诗人的诗选，他们也是有可能给我们提供重要作品的。不幸的是，我知道的唯一一本当代诗选，作品选得非常不好，我甚至不愿提它的名字。

当然，每个人都应该读读莎士比亚的悲剧。他不仅是有史以来最伟大的诗人，还是我们民族的光荣。我本人虽然对莎士比亚的戏剧很熟，还是希望能有一位有品味、知识和判断力的人出来编一本莎士比亚的戏剧和诗歌精选集，不仅要包括我们人所共知的那些著名选段，也要包括一些极好的片段，甚至单独的诗行，如此好使我永远能于一册之中，便尽得莎翁所有诗歌的精华。（自从我写过这话以后，现已有乔治·瑞兰德编选的一个集子问世，名为《人生阶段》(8)。此书几乎达成了我的心愿，任何人对此类选集的期待不过如此了。对一个动荡不安的世界而言，此书不啻为一份受欢迎的礼物。）

亨利·菲尔丁与《汤姆·琼斯》


1


写亨利·菲尔丁的难处在于世人对他所知甚少。一七六二年，菲尔丁去世八年后，阿瑟·墨非为他作了篇小传，作为对他一版著作的介绍。但是墨非其实并不了解菲尔丁，要说了解，似乎也仅限于菲尔丁的晚年。因此他几无可写，又要写满八十页，只好东拉西扯些冗长无趣的旁枝末节。他所述事实不仅极少，还经常被后来的研究证明是不准确的。最近一位详写菲尔丁的人是牛津大学彭布罗克学院的院长霍姆斯·达顿博士，他那两大卷《菲尔丁研究》是他辛劳的记录。达顿生动地描写了菲尔丁生时的政治环境，以及一七四五年小王位觊觎者(1)的那场失败的冒险，他的研究给菲尔丁一生波折的事业添加了色彩、深度和实质。有关菲尔丁，我不认为还有什么是这位杰出的作者未写到的了。

菲尔丁出生于绅士家庭。他父亲是索尔兹伯里的牧师约翰·菲尔丁的第三子，约翰·菲尔丁又是一位德斯蒙德伯爵的第五子。德斯蒙德家是登比家的支系，登比家则认为自己是哈布斯堡家族(2)的后裔。吉本，写《罗马帝国衰亡史》的吉本，在其自传中写道：“查理五世(3)的后继者们可能不认其英国兄弟，但是叫作《汤姆·琼斯》的这部传奇，这幅人情世态的美妙画卷，却将超越埃斯科里亚尔的宫殿(4)和奥地利皇室的鹰徽长存于世。”吉本的措辞读来铿锵，但遗憾的是，那些高贵的爵爷对其家系渊源的声称其实并无根据。他们的姓氏拼写是Feilding （而不是“菲尔丁”现在的拼写Fielding）。还有一个著名的故事。据说，某次，当时的德斯蒙德伯爵问菲尔丁这是怎么回事，菲尔丁回答说：“我只能猜这是因为我们这一支在阁下您那支之前学会了拼写。”

菲尔丁的父亲参过军，在马尔巴罗公爵(5)手下打过仗，据说“表现勇敢，名声不错”。他娶了王座法院法官亨利·古尔德爵士的女儿萨拉为妻。一七〇七年，在他的乡村邸宅——位于格拉斯顿伯里附近的夏朴罕庄园，我们的作家亨利·菲尔丁出生了。两三年后菲尔丁夫妇又添了两个女儿，全家搬到了多塞特郡的东斯陶尔，这是法官留给女儿的产业，次年亨利·菲尔丁上了伊顿公学。他在那里结交了一些珍贵的朋友。即便他离开伊顿的时候不是像墨非说的那样“对希腊作者有着非同寻常的熟悉，又在很小的时候就已把拉丁经典烂熟于胸”，他也肯定培养出了对古典学问的真爱。人生末年贫病交加时，他会读西塞罗的《论自我安慰》寻求慰藉。死前坐船去里斯本时，他也会随身携带一卷柏拉图的作品。

离开伊顿后，菲尔丁没上大学，而是去索尔兹伯里和他外祖母古尔德夫人住了一阵子，那时古尔德法官已经去世了。按达顿博士的说法，菲尔丁在外祖母家读了一点法律书籍，还读了大量各种题材的文学书籍。他那时是个英俊的青年，身高超过六英尺，强壮有力，活泼好动，眼睛深邃，罗马式的鼻子，上唇短而带一个嘲讽的弯儿，下巴向前突出，显示出倔强的性格。头发褐色带卷，牙齿洁白整齐。十八岁时他就显现出了将来会有的样子。有段时间他和一个忠仆住在莱姆里吉斯，这人肯为他“打人、杀人、致人残废”。菲尔丁在此爱上了一位名叫萨拉·安德鲁的小姐。这位小姐本就生得美，再加上相当有钱，更添了魅力。菲尔丁于是制订出了一个计划，想和她私奔，如有必要，还想用强力迫使她私奔，然后和她结婚。可惜事情败露，这个年轻女子被连忙转移走，和更合适的人安全结了婚。之后两三年，菲尔丁在伦敦用着外祖母给的零花钱，趁着自己还英俊潇洒，尽情干着他这样一个出身高贵的年轻人所能干的那些吃喝玩乐的美事。一七二八年，受亲戚玛丽·沃特利—蒙太古夫人的影响，再加上得到了迷人却并不特别贞洁的女演员安妮·奥德菲尔德的帮助，他的一部戏剧在剧院云集的朱瑞巷上演了，制作人是柯莱·西柏。这部剧叫《歌舞会中的恋爱》，演了四场。之后不久，他去了荷兰的莱顿大学，他父亲答应每年给他两百镑。但他父亲不久再婚了，不能或不愿继续负担先前许诺的生活费，于是大约一年后菲尔丁不得不回到了英国。他当时经济状况非常窘迫，正如他自己曾诙谐地说过的那样，他别无选择，要么当个出租马车车夫，要么替人捉刀(6)。

曾在《英国文人系列》中为菲尔丁作传的奥斯汀·道伯森说：“菲尔丁的秉性和机遇将他引向舞台。”菲尔丁有当剧作家所需的那种兴致与幽默，也有对当时社会的敏锐观察力。除此，他还有一定程度的独创性和一种结构感。道伯森所谓的“秉性”很可能是指，首先，菲尔丁有种表现欲，这是身为剧作家必不可少的；其次，菲尔丁把写剧看成赚快钱的轻松手段。所谓“机遇”，大概是委婉地说菲尔丁是个俊男，精力旺盛，合了一个著名女演员的意。取悦女主角从来都是年轻剧作家最能确保上戏的手段。在一七二九年到一七三七年间，菲尔丁创作并改编了二十六部剧，其中至少有三部大获成功。这三部里边又有一部把斯威夫特都逗笑了，而在这位教长(7)的记忆中，有生以来他总共只笑过两次。菲尔丁的纯喜剧写得不是很成功。据我所知，他最成功之处似乎是他自己发明了一种体裁。这种体裁载歌载舞，有简短的主题说明，有戏仿，有对名人的影射。实际上，就和我们现在流行的、讽刺时事的滑稽剧差不多。按照墨非的说法，菲尔丁的闹剧“通常都是两三个上午的急就章，他写东西太容易了”。达顿博士认为这是夸大其词。我认为不是。这些剧有的很短。我自己就听说过一个周末就写出一部轻喜剧的例子，而且写得还不差。菲尔丁的最后两部剧抨击了当时的政治腐败，因为抨击得太有力，内阁出台了《戏剧审查法案》，要求剧院经理在上戏前务必先从宫务大臣处获得许可。这个法直到现在还在折磨着英国作家。从此菲尔丁基本不再写戏剧，如果写，就只有一个理由：太缺钱。

我不假装通读过他的戏剧，我只是翻过，并时不时地读一场，我发现他戏剧中的对话很是自然活泼。我读过最有趣的一段是他在《伟大的大拇指汤姆》的演员表里以当时流行的口吻对一个人物的描述：“一个绝无过失的女人，只除了有点太爱喝酒。”菲尔丁的戏剧常被认为无甚出奇。无疑，他如果不是《汤姆·琼斯》的作者，那么他的戏剧连想都不会有人想起。它们缺少两百年后坐在书斋里读他戏剧的那些批评家所期待的文学性，而康格里夫(8)的戏剧就有这种文学性。但是戏剧是拿来演的，而不是读的。有文学性当然好，可是使一出戏剧成为好剧的并非文学性，反而这种性质还可能（也经常）使戏剧演不好。菲尔丁的戏剧现在已经没了当初的优点，因为戏剧靠的是现实，因此戏剧是昙花一现的，几乎就像报纸的昙花一现一样短暂。菲尔丁的戏剧，我已经说过，能成功靠的是时事。不过哪怕他的戏分量再轻，也一定有其长处。只是因为一个年轻人有写戏的愿望，还有一个受欢迎的女演员的推动，都不至于使剧院经理一个接一个地上他的戏，除非他的戏打动了观众。观众才是此事的最终的评判者。如果剧院经理连观众的口味都摸不准的话，那他准保要破产了。菲尔丁的戏至少有观众喜欢的长处。《伟大的大拇指汤姆》演了“超过四十晚”，《帕斯昆》演了六十晚，而约翰·盖伊的《乞丐的歌剧》也无非就演了这么久。

菲尔丁对他的戏剧的价值不抱幻想，自言他本该在开始写舞台剧的时候就放弃。他写戏只是为了钱，并且不觉得观众有什么理解力。墨非说：“他现在还健在的很多朋友都知道，当他签了合同答应写个戏剧或写个闹剧的时候，他会很晚才从酒馆回家。第二天上午他就能给演员们拿出一场戏来，而那是写在他包烟草的纸上的，他很喜欢这么做。”排练那部名为《婚礼那天》的喜剧时，参演的盖里克(9)不看好其中一场戏，要求菲尔丁砍掉。“不，该死！”菲尔丁说，“这场戏要是不好，也得让观众发现不好。”戏剧开演了，观众闹嚷着表示不悦。盖里克回到休息室，发现那位剧作者“正在那儿陶醉于自己的天才，用一瓶香槟安慰自己。他已经喝了不少了，此时斜眼看着盖里克，烟草和着口水顺嘴角往下滴着。‘出什么事了，盖里克？’他说，‘他们在嘘什么？’

“‘我早跟你说过让你砍掉那场戏，我就知道不行。他们把我吓坏了，我一整晚都镇定不下来了。’

“‘哦，该死！’菲尔丁回答，‘他们发现了吗？’”

这个故事是墨非讲的，我必须说我怀疑它的真实性。我认识剧院经理，和他们打过交道，他们就是盖里克那样。在我看来，如果盖里克认为某场戏会毁了整出剧，他是不可能答应出演的。但是如果这事不是真的，又怎么会被人编出来。这至少表明了菲尔丁的朋友和伙伴对他的看法。

如果关于菲尔丁的戏剧我说了不少，而戏剧又只不过是他文学生涯的一个插曲，那是因为我认为戏剧对他作为小说家的发展起到了重要作用。很多杰出的小说家都尝试过写戏剧，但我想不起谁是真正成功了的。原因是写小说和写戏剧所需的技巧大不相同，知道如何写小说对写戏剧毫无帮助。小说家为了展开主题，想要花多少时间就花多少时间；他想要多细致地描写人物就可以有多细致；他还可以通过叙述人物的动机，向读者解释人物的行为。如果他有技巧，他能让不可能的事变得逼真可能。如果他有叙述的天赋，他还能逐渐构筑起高潮，而漫长的准备会让这个高潮无比惊人，最极致的一例就是克拉丽莎宣布她被诱奸的那封信(10)。小说家不必表现动作，他只需告诉读者有这么一个动作。他可以让人物用对话解释自己，想写多少页就写多少页。但是戏剧靠的是动作，我说的动作当然不是落下悬崖或被公共汽车碾压这样的剧烈动作，类似递给一个人一杯水这样的动作就可以具备最高的戏剧张力。观众的注意力是非常有限的，需要不断有事发生才能吸引他们的注意。必须一直有新鲜东西。主题必须马上言明，其发展必须遵循一条明确的路线，不能偏移到不相干的小路上去。对话必须干脆切题，必须使观众听到后，不用停下来思考就能明白意思。人物必须有整体性，不能超出观众的理解力，必须一眼就能看明白。人物可以复杂，但是必须复杂得合理。戏剧不能有没系上的线头，或者未了之事。一出戏不管多么微不足道，基础必须稳固，结构也必须紧凑。

如果一个剧作家掌握了我刚才说的这些戏剧的核心品质，可以让观众愿意坐在那里愉快地看完一出戏，那他写小说的时候就有优势了。他学会了简洁，学会了让事件快速发生的重要性，学会了不在半路游移，而是紧扣主题，不断推进他的故事。他还学会了不靠描述，而是让人物通过言行来表现自己。这样一来，当他在小说所许可的更广阔的画布上施展时，他就不仅可以从小说这一形式的特殊优势中获益，他作为剧作家的训练也会使他的小说生动活泼、进展迅速、富有戏剧性。这些都是很好的品质，是某些很好的小说家也不具备的品质，哪怕他们在别的方面富有优点。我不认为菲尔丁写戏剧的那些年是浪费了。相反，我认为他当时获得的经验对他写小说极具价值。

一七三四年，菲尔丁和夏洛特·克莱德克结了婚。她是索尔兹伯里一个寡妇的女儿，这个寡妇只有两个女儿。除了美丽迷人外，我们对她一无所知。克莱德克夫人是个很世俗、很有主意的女人，她明显不赞成菲尔丁对她女儿的追求。这无可厚非，因为菲尔丁的生计实在不稳，而他和戏剧界的联系也很难让一个谨慎的母亲鼓起信心来。不管怎么样，两个相爱的人私奔了。克莱德克夫人追过，但还是“没来得及阻止他们结婚”。菲尔丁把夏洛特写成《汤姆·琼斯》中的索菲亚，以及《艾米莉亚》中的艾米莉亚，读者由此可以知道她在她的爱人，也就是她的丈夫眼中的确切模样了。克莱德克夫人一年后死了，留给夏洛特一千五百镑。钱来得正是时候，因为那年年初上演的一出菲尔丁的戏惨遭失败，他正缺钱。他当时习惯时不时地去他母亲的小产业上住上一阵，现在他和他年轻的妻子同去了。接下来的九个月里他大宴宾客，尽情享受着乡村所能带来的种种乐趣。等他拿着夏洛特剩下的钱回到伦敦时，他找到了干草街的“小剧场”，很快就在那上演了据说是他最好的，也是最成功的一出戏——《帕斯昆：一出时代的讽刺剧》。

当《戏剧审查法案》变成法律，菲尔丁的戏剧事业因此结束之时，他已经有了一妻二子，还有了一点很珍贵的、不够养活妻儿的钱，他不得不找条活路。他三十一岁了。他进了中殿律师学院。虽然按照墨非的说法，“他早年寻欢作乐的恶习还会时不时地萌发，加之他充沛的精力，使他沉迷于伦敦的疯狂享乐中”，但他努力学习，最终成了律师。他准备好好干番事业，但他业务不多，可能是因为律师们都对他这个仅靠写轻喜剧和政治讽刺剧出名的人有所怀疑。何况当律师三年后，他开始经常痛风，使他无法定期出庭。为了挣钱他不得不向报纸卖文，并同时挤时间写了他的第一部小说《约瑟夫·安德鲁》。两年后他的妻子死了。她的死使他痛苦得发疯。路易莎·斯图尔特夫人说：“他热烈地爱着她，她也如此回报他的爱。但他们过得并不幸福，因为他们总是很穷，很少感到平静和安全。全世界都知道他的轻率所在：他只要有钱就会乱花，根本不会为明天着想。有时候他们有体面的住处，日子过得还算舒适。可有时候他们住在糟糕的阁楼上，连生活必需品都没有，更别说他还时常被人从负债人拘留所和别的藏身之处找出来。他靠着能屈能伸的高兴劲儿扛了过去，可忧愁和焦虑却折磨着她娇弱的心灵，毁坏了她的身体。她逐渐憔悴了，最后发了烧，在他的怀里死去了。”这段话很真实，部分在《艾米莉亚》中得到了确认。我们知道小说家习惯把他们自身经历过的任何小事都用于创作，因此当菲尔丁创作比利·布斯这个人物的时候，他就是以自己为原型进行刻画的，还以妻子为原型塑造了艾米莉亚这个人物，还用上了他们婚姻生活中发生过的各种事。妻子去世四年后，他娶了妻子的女仆玛丽·丹尼尔，她那时已有了三个月的身孕。这桩婚事使他的朋友倍感震惊，他妹妹本来从夏洛特死后就与他同住的，后来也离开了他的家。他的亲戚玛丽·沃特利—蒙太古夫人对此非常轻蔑不屑，嫌他居然可以“销魂于给他煮饭的女佣”。玛丽·丹尼尔确实没什么个人魅力，但她是个好人，菲尔丁提到她时，从来都是怀着爱意与尊敬。她是个正派女人，把他照顾得很好，是个贤妻良母，给他生了两儿一女。

当菲尔丁还是个拼命奋斗的剧作家时，他曾向权倾一时的罗伯特·沃波尔爵士献过殷勤。他把名为《现代丈夫》的戏剧热情洋溢地敬献给沃波尔，但这位不知感恩的首相却不愿为他做任何事。于是菲尔丁决定投靠沃波尔的反对者，还立刻就向反对党领袖之一的切斯特菲尔德爵爷示好。正如达顿博士所说的那样，菲尔丁“明确表示愿意把他的机智和幽默为反对党所用，只要他们愿意用”。他们终于表示愿意，菲尔丁于是被任命为一份名为《斗士》的报纸的主编，这份报纸的创立就是为了攻击和嘲笑沃波尔及其内阁。一七四二年沃波尔倒台了，很快由亨利·佩勒姆接替。现在菲尔丁为之服务的党派掌权了。多年来他为支持政府以及为政府辩护的报纸做编辑和写稿工作，现在他自然期待他的服务能得到奖赏。他在伊顿公学结交的、至今还在维系着的一个朋友名叫乔治·利特尔顿，此人出身于显赫的政治家庭（至今仍很显赫），还是个慷慨的文学赞助人。利特尔顿当时被任命为佩勒姆政府的财政大臣，于是在利特尔顿的影响下，菲尔丁在一七八四年被任命为威斯敏斯特的治安官。很快，为了使他可以更为有效地行使职权，他的管辖范围扩大到了米德尔塞克斯，他也和家人搬到了伦敦警察法庭所在的博街的官方住所。他的律师训练，他对生活的了解，以及他天生的才能，使他非常适合这个职位。菲尔丁说在他任职前，这个职位一年可以赚五百镑脏钱，但他任职后，这个职位一年顶多只能挣三百镑干净钱了。通过贝德福德公爵的关系，菲尔丁还从公众服务资金中领到了一笔养老金，每年大概有一两百镑。一七四九年他出版了《汤姆·琼斯》，此书一定是他还在为政府编报纸期间就在写的。他因此书一共挣了七百镑。那时的钱至少值现在的五六倍，因此这笔钱大约等于现在的四千镑。今天一部小说能挣这么多也很好了。

此时菲尔丁的健康已经很糟糕了。痛风经常发作，他经常需要去巴斯，或是去他在伦敦附近的一间农舍疗养，但他没有停止写作。他写与工作有关的政论文，其中一篇文章名为《近来抢劫案多发之威胁的成因探讨》，据说引起了《杜松子法案》(11)的通过。他还写了《艾米莉亚》。他的勤奋令人感叹。一七五一年《艾米莉亚》出版时，他又着手编《考文特花园日报》。他的健康愈发差了，明显不能在博街继续行使职能了。一七五四年，在打掉了一个令伦敦人谈之色变的“恶棍和割喉者团伙”后，他辞了职，让位于他的同父异母弟弟约翰·菲尔丁。现在看来，他唯一的生机就是找一个气候比英国和暖的地方，于是同年六月，他离开故国，乘理查德·维尔船长的“葡萄牙王后号”去了里斯本。他于八月到达，两个月后就死了，时年仅四十七岁。

以上我依据不完整的材料简略介绍了菲尔丁的生平。当我思考菲尔丁的人生时，我心头涌起了一种独特的情感。他是个男人。很少有小说家在书中比他投入的自我更多，因此当你读他的小说时，你会感受到一种感情，就像你对相熟多年的某个人所感受到的那种感情一样。他身上有一种他那个时代的时代感，有种英国人的特质，直到最近这种人还很普遍。你会在伦敦遇见他，在赛马中心纽马克特遇见他，在莱斯特郡的打猎季节遇见他，八月在疗养地考兹遇见他，仲冬时节在戛纳和蒙特卡洛遇见他。他是个绅士，他有教养，长得好，性情好，对人和善，容易相处。他并不特别文雅，但他能宽容那些文雅之士。他喜欢姑娘，却经常发现自己被列为离婚诉讼中涉嫌通奸的共同被告。他不是这个世界上最勤劳的那种人，但他也看不出他为什么要成为这样的人。他虽然不做事，但也绝不懒散。他有一份适当的收入，花得也大方。如果战争爆发，他会参军，他的勇敢将有目共睹。他绝对无害，人人都喜欢他。然而时光荏苒，年华不再，他不再有钱，生活也不再似往昔容易。他只得放弃打猎，但他还是打得一手好高尔夫，你也会永远高兴地看见他出现在俱乐部的棋牌室里。他会娶个老情人，一个有钱的寡妇，于是在中年的时候安定下来，做她的好丈夫。可是今天的世界容不下他了，不消几年他这类人就要绝种了。这样一个人，我觉得就是菲尔丁。但他恰巧有一份伟大的天赋使他成了作家。当他想努力工作时，他就能努力工作。他也喜欢醇酒和女人。人们一讨论道德，脑子里主要想的就是贞洁，但贞洁只是道德中很小的一部分，还可能不是最主要的部分。菲尔丁欲望强烈，并且毫不犹豫地屈从于此，可他也能爱得温柔。注意，是性爱，不是爱情。性爱和爱情不同，性爱是植根于性的，但是没有爱也可以有性。拒绝承认这点只能说明虚伪或无知。性欲是一种动物本能，不比饥和渴更丢人，也不比饥和渴更有理由不应得到满足。如果菲尔丁享受了性之乐趣，哪怕有些滥交，他也没比大多数男人坏到哪去。他就像我们中的大多数人那样后悔“犯罪”（如果能说这是罪的话），但是机会来临的时候还会再犯。他急躁易怒，但是心地善良且慷慨大方，是个腐败时代里的实诚人。他是个深情的丈夫，慈爱的父亲。他勇敢真诚，对朋友好，朋友们也对他至死不渝。他虽然宽容别人的缺点，但痛恨野蛮和欺诈。他不因成功膨胀，有两只松鸡和一瓶葡萄酒就可以坚强地对抗逆境。他对生活来者不拒，兴致勃勃，愉快接受，并且尽情享受。事实上，他非常像他的汤姆·琼斯，与他的比利·布斯也并无不同。他是个真正的男人。

但是，我应该告诉读者，我所描述的菲尔丁和我上文经常提到的牛津大学彭布罗克学院的院长（霍姆斯·达顿博士）在他的巨著中所描述的菲尔丁并不吻合，虽然我从那部著作中获得了很多有用信息。“直到最近，”达顿博士写道，“一般人心目中的菲尔丁是个天才，‘心眼儿好’，有很多亲切的品质，但是放浪不羁，不负责任，犯过令人遗憾的错误，甚至更严重的过错也不是没有犯过。”他想尽力说服读者，让他们相信菲尔丁过去是被严重中伤了。

但是达顿博士极力否认的这个形象其实就是菲尔丁生前最常见的样子，熟悉他的人就是这样看他的。他生前确实遭到过政敌和文敌的痛击，他们也确有可能夸大了对他的指责。但是如果指责能伤人，那指责就必须合理。例如，已经作古的斯塔福德·克里普斯爵士有很多死敌，他们恨不得往他身上扔泥巴，说他是个两面派，背叛了他所在的阶级，但他们绝不会说他是个色鬼或酒鬼，因为众所周知，斯塔福德爵士为人品德高尚，极有节制。他们如果说他是酒鬼、色鬼，只能让他们自己显得荒谬。同样，围绕一个名人的诸多传奇固然未必全真，但是假如传奇只是似是而非，一样也不会让人相信。墨非讲过一个故事，说某次菲尔丁需要交税，让出版商预付给他一笔款子，可是当他拿钱回家时遇见了一个境遇更差的朋友，菲尔丁就把钱给了这人。收税官来了，菲尔丁带信给他说：“友谊已经召唤走了金钱，请阁下下次再来吧。”达顿博士认为此逸闻不真。可这事如果是编的，那也是因为它是可信的。菲尔丁被指责挥霍无度，他可能确实如此。但这是因为他总是开朗豪爽，对人友好，喜好宴饮交际，并且对金钱满不在乎。他经常欠债，可能有时还被“讨债者和法警”纠缠。他缺钱到无法可想的地步时，无疑会找朋友帮忙，他们也会借钱给他。思想高尚如埃德蒙·伯克(12)也是如此。作为剧作家，菲尔丁在戏剧圈厮混了多年。不管是过去还是现在，没有一个国家的戏剧圈会被认为是一个能教会年轻人禁欲的好地方。帮菲尔丁上演他第一部戏剧的安妮·奥德菲尔德死后葬在威斯敏斯特教堂，但是因为她曾被两位绅士包养，育有两名私生子，因此为她立碑纪念的请求被拒绝了。当年她要是没向年轻英俊的菲尔丁施爱就怪了。而如果她曾用恩客的钱资助过当时一文不名的菲尔丁，那也没什么好奇怪的。屈服的可能只是他的贫穷而不是他的意愿。如果他年轻时经常在女人堆里厮混，那只能说明他和他那个时代（还有我们这个时代）那些有机会、有优势的年轻人无甚不同。他无疑“曾在很多个夜晚在酒馆里喝得酩酊大醉”。但是不管哲学家们怎么坚称，常识都一致认为年轻人的道德和老年人的道德不同，道德准则也因人的身份不同而不同。神学博士滥交应受谴责，年轻人滥交却合乎常情。一个大学里的院长喝醉了不可原谅，虽然偶尔喝醉也在意料之中，但是一个本科生喝醉则无甚关碍。

菲尔丁的敌人攻击他在政治上有奶就是娘，他确实如此。他很乐意用他的伟大才干为沃波尔效劳，但当他发现人家根本不需要时，他也同样乐意投靠沃波尔的反对者。这并不要求牺牲什么原则，因为当时的执政党和反对党唯一真正的区别就在于执政党掌握着官职任命、有薪水，而反对党则没有。腐败无处不在。只要有好处，居高位者一样乐意换边站，就像菲尔丁为了糊口可以变脸一样。但是菲尔丁有一件事值得称赞，那就是当沃波尔发现他很危险，向他提出只要他离开反对党就答应他的条件时，菲尔丁却拒绝了。菲尔丁这样做也很聪明，因为不久沃波尔就倒台了。菲尔丁在上层社会有朋友，在文艺界有朋友，但从他的作品中看，似乎可以肯定他很享受和底层人以及声名狼藉者交往。为此他曾遭到严厉指责。但是在我看来，他如果没有体验过并很享受底层生活的话，他是不可能如此生动美妙地写出那些所谓的底层生活场景的。菲尔丁活着时，别人普遍把他看成一个放荡挥霍之徒。这方面的证据太强大，无法忽视。可是，如果他真是彭布罗克院长希望我们相信的那么体面、正派、节制的话，他就不可能写出《汤姆·琼斯》这种书了。达顿博士非要洗白菲尔丁可能自有其用，但我想有一点误导了博士，即他没想到矛盾的甚至相互排斥的品质是可以同时并存于一个人身上的，而且不知怎的还会造成一种相当合理的和谐。对一个一直过着安逸的学院生活的人而言，被如此误导是很自然的。在院长看来，因为菲尔丁慷慨善良、正直温和、亲切诚实，他就不可能同时还是个败家子，会从阔朋友那儿乞食要钱；就不可能出入酒馆，痛饮到毁了自己的健康的地步；就不可能一有机会就狂嫖滥交。院长宣称，菲尔丁在第一任妻子活着期间都绝对忠实于她。他怎么知道？菲尔丁当然爱他妻子，爱得热烈，但他绝不是第一个只要机会合适，就会暗地里冒一把险的丈夫，尽管他钟爱妻子。他极有可能像他笔下的布斯上尉一样，虽然犯错后无比悔恨，但仍然控制不了下次一有机会还会再犯。

玛丽·沃特利—蒙太古夫人曾在一封信里说：“我对亨利·菲尔丁的死感到难过，不仅是因为我将再也读不到他的作品了，还因为我相信他的损失比别人都大，因为没有人比他更享受生活，虽然很多人比他更有理由享受生活。他最高级的爱好无非是在最低级的堕落和苦恼中放荡。我认为当个夜间婚礼的主持人(13)都比他这份营生更高尚，更不那么令人恶心。当他面对一份鹿肉馅饼或一瓶香槟时，他欢乐的天性会使他忘了一切，虽然他后来把这份天性毁掉了大半。我相信他比这世界上的任何一个王孙公子享受过的欢乐时光都更多。”

有人读不了《汤姆·琼斯》。我不是说那些除了报纸和有插图的周刊以外什么都不读的人，或那些除了侦探小说以外什么都不读的人。我是说那些不反对你把他们划为知识分子的人，那些读过一遍以后还会愉快地重读《傲慢与偏见》，满足地重读《米德尔马契》，心怀敬意地重读《金碗》(14)的人。他们可能从未想过要读《汤姆·琼斯》，即使有时尝试过，也没能读得下去。这书让他们觉得无聊。说他们应该喜欢这书是没用的，读书本就没有什么应该不应该。读小说是为了娱乐。我再说一遍，如果一本小说给不了你这个，那就什么都给不了你。如果你觉得一本小说没意思，没人能指责你，就像没人有权因为你不喜欢牡蛎而指责你。但是我禁不住问自己，到底是什么使读者放下了这本书？吉本说它是人情世态的一幅美妙画卷，司各特赞扬它是真理和人性本身，狄更斯欣赏它并从中受益。萨克雷说：“《汤姆·琼斯》这部小说真叫美妙，其结构算得上是个奇迹。那些智慧的穿插情节，那样强大的观察力，那些层次众多、巧妙恰当的措辞和思想，那种堪称伟大的喜剧史诗般的人物多样性，都永远使读者处于钦佩和好奇中。”是因为读者无法对两百年前人们的生活方式、风俗习惯感兴趣？还是因为风格的问题？但是《汤姆·琼斯》的风格很是轻松自然。我忘了是谁说过，可能是菲尔丁的朋友切斯特菲尔德爵爷，他说好的风格让人感觉是一个有文化的人在说话。菲尔丁的风格正是如此。他与读者对话，告诉他们汤姆·琼斯的故事，就像他在晚餐桌上就着一瓶酒对三五知己说话一样。他绝不咬文嚼字。美丽贞洁的索菲亚明显是听惯了“妓女”“杂种”“荡妇”这些词。说到这个，真猜不出为什么菲尔丁写“婊子”（bitch）的时候要省掉两个字母（“b．．．ch”）。事实上，有时候索菲亚的爸爸，乡绅魏斯顿，就是这么随便地用这些词称呼她的。

用谈话风格写小说有其弊端，因为作者会对你推心置腹，会告诉你他对笔下人物的感想，以及他对人物所处环境的看法。作者总在你的近旁，妨碍了你与故事中的人直接交流。他的道德说教有时会惹恼你，一旦他开始离题闲扯，就又会变得乏味无聊。你不想听他对某些道德问题和社会问题发表看法，你只希望他继续讲故事。菲尔丁的漫谈几乎总是明智或有趣，通常也还简短，并有为之道歉的风度，他的温厚也闪耀其中。而当萨克雷不明智地模仿菲尔丁时，他就显得假正经、假虔诚了，你还会不由自主地怀疑他也并不真诚。

菲尔丁在《汤姆·琼斯》的每卷前都置一序言。有些批评家对这些序言很激赏，认为它们起到了锦上添花的作用。我只能说这是因为他们对小说本身不感兴趣。散文家会愿意挑个题目进行讨论。如果题目新，他会告诉你一些你不知道的东西。但是新题目不好找，因此散文家通常期待用自己的态度和看问题的独特方式来使你感兴趣。也就是说，他希望他本人让你感兴趣。但是读小说的时候你不会想要这么做。你不关心作者，他的作用只是讲故事和介绍你认识一堆人物。小说读者想知道的是作者使他感兴趣的人物后来怎么样了，如果他连这个都不想知道，他就没理由读小说了。因为读小说——这话我说多少遍都不会厌烦——不是为了启迪和教导，而是为了一种聪明的消遣。菲尔丁似乎是在写完小说后才添加了那些评论。它们和所介绍的章节几乎没有关联，而且他承认这些评论文字给他找了很多麻烦，于是我们纳闷他为什么要写这些评论。他不可能不知道很多读者认为他的小说低俗，不太道德，甚至淫秽，他可能是想用那些序给他的小说以某种道德的提升。这些序写得很明智，有时还相当精明。如果你熟读了小说，再读这些序时也会相当愉快。但是如果你是第一次读小说，那就不如跳过这些序。《汤姆·琼斯》的情节很好。我从达顿博士的书里得知柯勒律治曾感叹道：“菲尔丁真是个写作大师！”司各特和萨克雷也同样热情。达顿博士引用萨克雷的话说：“不管道德不道德，让任何人都先把这个浪漫故事看成艺术作品，之后他就会觉得它是人类才智最令人震惊的产物。在这部小说中，一件事哪怕再小都是由前事演化而来，都推动了故事的发展，都和整个故事紧密相关。如此一部神助之作（如果我们可以如此措辞的话），在其他小说那里前所未见。你可以砍掉半部《堂吉诃德》，或者添加、调换、改写司各特的任何浪漫传奇故事，两者都不会有任何损失。罗德里克·兰登(15)以及类似主人公不管经历了怎样的冒险奇遇，最后，还可以提琴拿来，婚礼开始。但是《汤姆·琼斯》的故事情节自第一页至最后一页始终环环相扣，衔接紧密。作者一定是在落笔前就在脑子里搭好、撑起了整个结构。他是如何做到这一点的，想想都令人称奇。”

这话有些夸张。《汤姆·琼斯》是按西班牙流浪汉小说和《吉尔·布拉斯》(16)的模式写的，其结构的简单取决于这一文体的本质：主人公因某种原因离开了家，一路上经历各种冒险，遇到各式人等，命运起起落落，最后发了财，娶了个迷人的妻子。菲尔丁一边套用这个模式，一边用无关的故事打断叙述。这真是个不怎么令人愉快的写作手法，而作家之所以采用，我想原因不光是我之前说的：他们总得给书商写点什么东西交稿，一两个故事总能充数；还因为他们担心一长串冒险会很无聊，觉得时不时讲个故事或许能给读者增添点刺激。再有就是如果他们想写短篇小说，除此之外他们没有别的办法能让公众看到。批评家们会斥责这种做法，但它就是不消亡。众所周知，狄更斯在《匹克威克外传》中就用了这种手法，《汤姆·琼斯》的读者也可以毫无损失地跳过“山中人”的故事和菲兹赫伯特太太的叙述。至于萨克雷评价菲尔丁书中的每一件事都其来有自，都推动了故事的发展，其实并不准确。汤姆·琼斯和吉卜赛人的相遇就没有导致任何事的发生，引入亨特夫人以及她向汤姆的求婚也很没必要。那一百镑账单的情节不仅毫无用处，还绝无可能，令人难以置信。至于萨克雷赞叹菲尔丁在动笔前就在脑子里构建了小说的整体结构，在我看来菲尔丁并没有这么做过，就像萨克雷在写《名利场》之前也不可能这么做一样。我觉得更有可能的是，一开始菲尔丁只是在脑子里有了故事主线，后来才边写边把那些具体情节编出来。他的大多数情节都写得不错。像他之前的那些流浪汉小说家一样，他并不在乎可能性。因为在他的书里最不可能的事都发生了，最离谱的巧合也都把人物聚合到了一起。但是他是如此活力十足地督促你一路前行，以至于你几乎没有时间，也不想要抗议这种不可能。他的人物都以原色描绘，粗率中带着豪放。如果他的人物缺少微妙之处，也因活力得到了弥补。这些人物极富个性，如果有所夸张，那也是时代使然，而且夸张的程度可能并未超越喜剧所能容许的范畴。我担心甄可敬先生(17)有点太好了，不像真人。但是菲尔丁在此处的失败也无非是像他之后的每个小说家那样，是因为太想要刻画一个道德完人，而经验告诉我们似乎没法不使甄可敬这样的人物显得有点蠢。读者对这么一个人是会有点不耐烦的，他太好了，于是被各式各样的人欺骗和利用。据说甄可敬原型是普里亚庄园的拉尔夫·艾伦。如果这是真的，菲尔丁对人物的描述也是真的，那只能说明直接源于生活的人物在小说里永远没法太令人信服。

另一方面，布利非也被认为坏得不像真人。菲尔丁痛恨欺骗和伪善，他对布利非的厌恶如此之深，以至于他把描绘这个人物的色彩涂抹得太重了。但是小气、鬼祟、自私、冷血的布利非并非是不常见的一类人，害怕露馅是唯一没有使他变成彻底的恶棍的原因。但是我觉得布利非如果不是坏得这么明显的话，这个人物刻画得倒是更能令人信服。他是讨厌，但是不鲜活，不像尤赖·希普(18)那样真实。我曾经自问，菲尔丁是否出于这样一种直觉有意把这个人物写少了：如果把他写得更活跃、更突出，那会使他过分强大和邪恶，从而掩盖了主角的光辉。

《汤姆·琼斯》一经问世就在公众那里大获成功，批评家们对此却基本都持严厉态度。有些反对令人颇感荒谬。比如，拉克斯伯罗夫人抱怨说书中人物太像“社会上遇见的那些人”。但是这本小说之所以广受谴责，主要还是因为不道德。汉娜·摩尔(19)在回忆录中说她从没见过约翰逊博士对她生气，只除了一次，那是当她提及《汤姆·琼斯》中的一些妙语的时候。“听到你从这么一本道德败坏的书中引文摘句，我真是吃惊，”约翰逊说，“我很遗憾听说你已经读了这本书，一个正派淑女是不该坦白这种事的。我几乎不知道还有什么作品比这本书更堕落。”可是现在，我要说，一个正派淑女最好在结婚前读读这本书。它会告诉她有关人生她所需知道的一切事实，以及很多有关男人的事实，在她进入婚姻这个艰难阶段之前，知道这些对她不会没用。人人都知道约翰逊博士是带有偏见的，他不承认菲尔丁在文学上的造诣，有一次还说菲尔丁是个木头脑袋。当鲍斯威尔提出异议的时候，约翰逊博士说：“说他是个木头脑袋，我的意思是说他是个毫无思想的流氓。”鲍斯威尔则回答：“先生，难道你不认为他非常自然地描绘了人生吗？”对此，约翰逊说：“可是，先生，那是非常卑贱的人生。理查逊过去经常说他如果不知道菲尔丁是谁，他会以为他是个马夫。”我们现在已经习惯了小说里的低贱生活，《汤姆·琼斯》里再也没有什么是我们时代的小说家不曾让我们熟知的了。约翰逊博士可能记得，菲尔丁把索菲亚刻画成了一个温柔迷人、令小说读者感到愉悦的人物。她单纯但不傻，贞洁但不假正经，她有性格、决心和勇气。她有爱心，长得还美。玛丽·沃特利—蒙太古夫人认为《汤姆·琼斯》是菲尔丁的代表作，这一点她判断得很正确。但她遗憾菲尔丁没有发现他已经把男主人公写成了一个浑蛋。我想她指的是那件被认为是汤姆·琼斯先生职业生涯中最应受到谴责的事：贝拉斯顿夫人迷上了他，并且发现他也早准备好了要满足她的欲望，因为他认为女人既然都已表达了那个愿望，男人就该向她“殷勤”行事，这是男人良好教养的一部分。汤姆分文皆无，甚至连一个先令都没有，没法雇车把自己送到贝拉斯顿夫人的住所，可是这位夫人如此富有。女人通常花别人的钱大方，花自己的钱小气，可是这位夫人却有一种罕见的慷慨，她大方地救了汤姆的急。男人从女人那里拿钱总归不好，也不合算，因为有钱女人在这种情况下想要的可比她们花出去的多得多。但在道德上，这并不比女人从男人那里拿钱更值得大惊小怪。如果普遍看法都认为男人用女人的钱更糟糕的话，那只能说普遍看法很愚蠢。我们的时代已经认为有必要发明一个词“小白脸”来指这种把个人魅力变成赚钱手段的男性，因此汤姆的粗俗，哪怕再应受人谴责，也不能算是什么新鲜事了。我毫不怀疑乔治二世(20)统治下小白脸的盛行就像如今乔治五世统治下一样势头强劲。好在就在贝拉斯顿夫人因为陪睡而给了汤姆五十镑的那天，汤姆被房东给他讲的一个她的什么亲戚的倒霉故事感动了，他于是把钱包给了她，让她随便拿吧，去解决那人的困难吧。这也正是汤姆品格的典型体现。他虽然真诚地深爱着美丽的索菲亚，可是同时，他和任何迷人的、容易得手的女人放纵肉欲，也并不觉得有什么良心不安。他还并不因为这些插曲而少爱了索菲亚一点。菲尔丁太聪明，才没有把他的男主人公写得比一般男人更自制。他知道如果我们晚上也能像白天一样谨慎，那我们就会更道德。而当索菲亚听说汤姆这些艳遇时，她也没有不依不饶地过分生气。她在这事上有着她这个性别少见的常识，这肯定是她最迷人的性格之一了。对此，奥斯汀·道布森有一句话说得很好，虽然说得不那么文雅。他说菲尔丁“并不假装要塑造完美的典范，他只想写出普通的人性，他的笔调宁要粗糙不要文雅，宁要自然不要造作，他的愿望是要绝对真实地做到这一切，而不是掩盖缺点短处，或为之寻找借口”。这是现实主义者努力在做的事，但是有史以来，现实主义者一直都在或多或少地因此受到猛烈的抨击。据我所知主要原因有两条。一是有很多人，尤其是年长者、有钱人和有权人，都采取这种态度，即：“我们当然知道世上有很多犯罪和不道德，但我们不想读到这些事。我们为什么要让自己不舒服呢？我们反正也无能为力。这世界毕竟总是有穷有富”。另一种人有别的理由批评现实主义者，他们承认世界上有犯罪和邪恶，残酷和压迫，但是他们问：“这是适合写小说的材料吗？年轻人读长辈们知道但是惋惜、反对的东西好吗？假如年轻人读的小说哪怕不算淫秽可是已经算得上很具挑逗性了，这难道不会腐蚀他们吗？那些表现世界上有很多美、善、自我牺牲、慷慨和英雄主义的小说难道不是更好吗？”现实主义者的回答是：“对于他所接触到的世界，他只想实事求是地说真话。他不相信人能毫不掺杂地行善，他认为人是善与恶的混合体，他容忍传统道德所不容忍的人性的怪癖，他认为这些怪癖是人性的、自然的，因此也就是可以为之辩解的。他希望他对人性善的描写就像他对人性恶的描写一样诚实，如果读者更感兴趣的是恶不是善，那不是他的错。他不能为人类这种动物身上的这个奇怪的特点负责。但是如果他对自己诚实，他会承认恶是可以用闪闪发光的色彩描摹的，善却似乎总带着一抹暗色。如果你问他如何为腐蚀年轻人这个控诉辩解，他会说年轻人最好知道他们将要与之打交道的世界是个什么样。如果他们期待太高，结果很可能是灾难一场。如果一个现实主义者能教会年轻人不要从别人那里期待太高，让他们一开始就知道每个人最关心的都只是他自己；如果不管以何种方式他还能教会他们：一、他们必须为他们得到的一切付出代价，无论地位、财富、荣誉、爱情还是名誉；二、所谓智慧，很大程度在于不要为了得到某样东西付出超值的代价，那他就能比所有的老师和牧师加起来都更能教会年轻人如何过好这艰难的生活。但是，他还会再加一句，说他既不是老师，也不是牧师，他希望他是艺术家。”

简·奥斯汀与《傲慢与偏见》


1


简·奥斯汀的生平事迹可以几句话说完。她家是个古老家族，像英国很多最显赫的家族一样，是靠羊毛贸易发迹的，羊毛贸易一度是这个国家的支柱性产业。发财后，她家也像比她们更厉害的那些家族一样，买了地，逐渐加入了有地士绅的行列。但是奥斯汀所属的这个支系和其他支系相比，似乎只继承了巨大财富中的很少一点，他们落魄了。奥斯汀的父亲叫乔治·奥斯汀，祖父叫威廉·奥斯汀，祖父是汤布里奇那里的外科医生，这个职业在十八世纪初时被认为比律师这一职业高级不了多少。而我们从《劝导》中得知，即使到了奥斯汀生活的时期，律师也还无甚社会地位。《劝导》中有这样一段描写，“只不过是个爵士遗孀”的罗素夫人吃惊地发现从男爵的女儿艾略特小姐居然和律师的女儿克雷太太(1)有交往，而后者“对艾小姐而言，本该啥也不是，本该只是艾小姐敬而远之的对象”。外科医生威廉·奥斯汀去世得早，于是他的哥哥弗朗西斯·奥斯汀把孤儿乔治送进了汤布里奇学校，后来又送去了牛津的圣约翰学院。这些事实是我从查普曼博士的克拉克讲义中获知的，这些讲义现已出书，名为《简·奥斯汀：事实与问题》。我以下所写均受惠于这本好书。

乔治·奥斯汀先是成了圣约翰学院的研究员，领圣职后，在哥德莫山姆的一个名为托马斯·奈特的亲戚的帮助下，获得了汉普郡史蒂文顿地方的牧师职位。两年后，伯父又给他买下了附近一个名叫迪恩的地方的圣职。我们对这位慷慨的亲戚一无所知，但可以猜想他就像《傲慢与偏见》里的加德纳先生一样，是个商人。

乔治·奥斯汀牧师娶了托马斯·雷的女儿卡桑德拉·雷。托马斯·雷是牛津万灵学院的研究员，他还领着亨利镇附近哈珀斯顿的一份圣俸。我年轻时看卡桑德拉·雷这样的人，会认为她出身不俗，也就是说，像赫斯特蒙索的赫尔家一样，她是有地士绅和贵族的远亲。对外科医生的儿子来说，这门亲事让他上了一个台阶。他们生了两女六男共八个孩子，其中两个女儿是卡桑德拉和简。为了增加收入，史蒂文顿的这位牧师还开馆收徒，六个儿子就是在家受教的。其中两个后来上了牛津的圣约翰学院，因为从他们母亲一方的家谱看来，他们算是学院创建者的亲戚。还有一个儿子叫乔治，我们对他一无所知，查普曼认为他又聋又哑。另有两个儿子加入了海军，都取得了辉煌的成就。最幸运的是爱德华，他被托马斯·奈特收养，继承了后者在肯特郡和汉普郡的产业。

简·奥斯汀是小女儿，生于一七七五年。她二十六岁时，父亲辞了职，把职位让给了已领圣职的大儿子，自己搬到了巴斯。乔治·奥斯汀死于一八〇五年，几个月后，他的寡妻和两个女儿搬去了南安普敦。就是在这里，简给姐姐卡桑德拉写信，讲述她和母亲的一次拜访：“我们发现只有蓝丝太太一人在家。不论她如何夸耀子孙，除了一架大钢琴外，什么子孙也没出现……他们很有钱，过得很气派，她也似乎很喜欢有钱。我们向她暗示我们远非如此，很快她就会觉得我们不值得她结交了。”奥斯汀先生死时确实没给奥斯汀太太留下什么钱，但是儿子们添了些，足够她过得还算舒适。被领养的爱德华在欧洲大陆的游学之旅(2)结束后，娶了古德尼斯通从男爵布鲁克·布里奇的女儿伊丽莎白。其领养者托马斯·奈特死于一七九四年，三年后他的遗孀把哥德莫山姆和查顿的产业交给爱德华，自己拿了一份年金去了坎特伯雷生活。多年后，爱德华让他母亲在这两份产业中任选一处居住，她选了查顿。于是简·奥斯汀一直住在那里，除了中间偶尔访亲问友以外，有时拜访会持续好几个星期之久。最后因为生病，她不得不去了温彻斯特，因为那里的医生比农村的好。一八一七年她死于温彻斯特，安葬在温彻斯特大教堂。

据说简·奥斯汀长相动人，“她的身材颀长苗条，步履轻盈坚定，整个人显得健康、有活力。她的肤色是健康的浅黑色。她的脸蛋圆鼓鼓的，鼻子嘴巴小巧标致，眼睛是明亮的浅褐色，头发是褐色的，自然拳曲，垂在脸颊两侧。”但我看到过的唯一一张简·奥斯汀的肖像，却展示出一个五官毫无特色、眼睛又大又圆、胸部高耸的胖脸年轻女子。当然也可能是画家没画好。

简和她姐姐感情很深。从女孩到女人，她们俩总在一起。直到简去世，她们俩都睡同一个卧室。卡桑德拉被送去上学的时候，简也跟着一起去了。哪怕她年纪还太小，还无法从女校教育中受益，但她还是跟着去了，因为离开姐姐她会非常难过。她们的妈妈说：“如果卡桑德拉要被砍头，简也会坚持和她有难同当。”“卡桑德拉比简漂亮，性情更冷淡沉静，不爱公开表露感情，不如简开朗，但她的优点是总能控制住自己的脾气。不过简天生脾气好，她的脾气永远不需要控制。”现存大多数简的信，都是简在两姐妹分离时写给卡桑德拉的。很多简·奥斯汀最热情的崇拜者认为这些信价值不高，认为它们表明简·奥斯汀是个冷淡、没感情的人，认为她的兴趣平凡琐碎。我对此感到吃惊，我认为这些信非常自然。简·奥斯汀绝不会想到除了卡桑德拉以外，还会有其他人读到这些信，因此她告诉姐姐的是她认为姐姐会感兴趣的事。比如人们的衣着如何，自己买的那块印花的平纹细布多少钱，自己新认识了什么人，遇到了哪些老友，以及听到了什么闲话。

近年来出版了一些名作家的书信集。我展卷拜读时，时不时会产生一种怀疑：在这些作家的脑海中是不是想过将来有一天自己的通信会被出版。当我知道他们还留有信的副本时，我的怀疑就变成了确信。安德烈·纪德想出版他和克洛岱尔(3)的通信，克洛岱尔可能不想出，就说他手里纪德的信都毁了，纪德却说没关系，他还有副本。纪德还告诉我们，当他发现妻子把他写给她的情书都烧了时，他哭了一星期，因为他认为这些情书是他文学成就的巅峰之作，是他能否吸引后世注意的主要凭证。狄更斯更是每遇外出旅行，就会给朋友写长信，洋洋洒洒地描写他所见到的风景。正如他的第一个传记作者约翰·福斯特所说的那样，这些信一字不改就可直接出版。那时的人似乎更有耐心。可是，如果你收到朋友来信，信里诗情画意地给你描写山川峰峦和纪念碑，可你更想知道的却是他是否遇到了什么有趣的人，是否参加了什么聚会，是否给你买了你希望他捎回来的书、领带或手绢，那么收到这样信的你只会失望。

在写给卡桑德拉的一封信中，简说：“我现在已经掌握了真正的书信艺术。我们总是被告知，书信艺术就是用笔把你想当面说的话写下来。我在这封信里已经尽我所能地和你用最快的速度说话了。”她当然是对的，这就是写信的艺术。她轻松完美地掌握了这门艺术。既然她说她谈话就如她写信一般，而她的信中又充满了机智幽默、辛辣讽刺、诙谐刻薄的妙语，那么我们就可以肯定她的谈话也是令人愉快的。她的每一封信都有引人发笑的趣语。以下我将举例说明她的风格，以博诸君一笑：

贫穷是单身女子容易有的一种可怕倾向，可这也正是她需要结婚的强大理由。

想想吧，赫德太太死了！可怜的女人，她做了这世界上唯一一件她能做而不让人骂的事。

谢尔本镇的黑尔太太昨晚因惊吓产下了一名死婴，生产时间比预产期早了数周。我猜这是因为她一不留神看了她丈夫一眼。

我们目睹了W．K．太太的死。我不知道有谁喜欢她，因此对她的“未亡人”也不抱同情，但是现在，我正为她丈夫的缘故感伤，觉得他还不如娶夏普小姐。

我钦佩张伯伦太太头发做得好，但是比这更亲切的情感，我就感受不到了。朗利小姐就好像所有宽鼻大嘴、衣着时髦、袒胸露乳的矮个女孩一样。斯坦赫普上将颇具绅士风度，只不过他的腿太短，尾巴(4)又太长。

伊莱莎(5)在巴顿见到了克雷文爵爷，这会儿可能又在坎特伯雷见了他一次，因为据说本周某天他们约好了他会去那里。她觉得他的风度非常怡人，唯一不怡人的一点似乎是他现今有个情人和他同住在艾什顿庄园。

W．先生大约二十五六岁年纪，长得不难看，但也不讨人喜欢。当然他也没有头衔。他有种冷静的绅士做派，可是非常沉默。他们说他叫亨利，这说明命运的赐予是多么不公。我见过很多约翰和托马斯，都比他讨人喜欢。

理查德·哈维太太要结婚了，这可是个大秘密，只有一半街坊知道，你千万别说。

黑尔医生的哀悼如此深切，一定是他母亲、他妻子或他本人死了。

简·奥斯汀喜欢跳舞，以下是她向卡桑德拉描述的她去过的一些舞会：

只有十二支舞，我跳了九支，只因为缺少舞伴才没跳剩下那三支。

有一位绅士，是个柴郡的军官，人年轻，长得还帅。有人跟我说，他很想让人介绍跟我认识。但是因为他的愿望还没有强烈到不怕麻烦去采取行动的地步，因此我们最终也没能认识。

美人不多，有也不美。艾尔蒙格(6)小姐看起来气色不佳，布兰特(7)太太是唯一比较受人欣赏的。她还和九月的时候一样，还是大脸、肥颈、钻石束发带、白鞋，有个皮色粉红的丈夫。

查尔斯·波莱特周四开了个舞会，让他所有的邻居都大感不安。你知道他们当然都对他的经济状况无比感兴趣，都巴不得他赶紧破产。他妻子正如所有人希望的那样：愚蠢、易怒、放肆。

一次，简的一个亲戚让人传了闲话。事情牵扯到一位芒特博士，因为他的所作所为，他妻子回了娘家。奥斯汀对此写道：“但是因为芒特博士是个牧师，因此他俩的感情哪怕再不道德，也有一种端庄的姿态。”

奥斯汀牙尖嘴利，幽默感惊人。她喜欢笑，也喜欢惹人发笑。一个幽默家想到一件趣事憋着不说是不可能的。而且，老天知道，想要幽默而有时又没点恶毒也是不行的。人类的恻隐之心很难让人感到兴奋。简对他人的荒唐、自负、做作和虚伪有一种敏锐的感知力，他们使她感到好笑而不是恼怒，这是她令人称道之处。她太善良，不会当面对人说一些使人痛苦的话，但她当然也觉得拿他们开开玩笑，让自己和卡桑德拉乐一乐也没什么不好。我即使在她最刻薄的话里也没听出居心不良，她的幽默是建立在观察和天赋的基础上的，幽默本该如此。可是如有需要，她也可以严肃。她哥哥爱德华·奥斯汀虽然从托马斯·奈特那里继承了肯特郡和汉普郡的产业，但大多数时候都住在坎特伯雷附近的哥德莫山姆庄园，简和卡桑德拉经常来此轮流小住，有时一住就是三个月。爱德华的长女范妮是简最喜欢的侄女，她后来嫁给了爱德华·纳奇布尔爵士，生的儿子受封为贵族，成了布雷伯恩爵爷，就是他第一个出版了奥斯汀的通信集。集子里有两封信是简写给范妮的，范妮那时还年轻，正在考虑如何应对一个想求娶她的年轻人。这两封信写得很好，既有冷静的理智也有温柔的情感。

几年前，彼得·昆纳在《康希尔杂志》发表了一封那时已是纳奇布尔夫人的范妮很多年后写给她妹妹莱斯太太的信，信中提到她们著名的姑妈，这封信着实令奥斯汀的很多崇拜者吃了一惊。它既令人吃惊，又极具那个时代的特色，因此在获得了已故布雷伯恩爵爷的许可后，我把信附在了此处。信中的画线处(8)是原作者所为。因为爱德华·奥斯汀一八一二年改姓了奈特，因此此处须指出，纳奇布尔夫人信中所指的奈特太太是托马斯·奈特的遗孀。从这封信的开头可以判断，关于她们的姑姑是否“文雅”，莱斯太太听到了一些议论，她感到不安，于是写信向姐姐询问传言是否为实。纳奇布尔夫人如此回复：

是的，我的爱，简姑姑因为诸多条件所限，没能达到她的才能所应达到的文雅。假如她能多活五十年，她将在很多方面更加符合我们更为文雅的品味。她们没有钱，身边与之交往的人也绝不高贵，或者简言之，只是些平庸之辈。她们自己虽然智力和学识超群，但在文雅方面，却和这些平庸之辈处于同一水平。不过我认为，她们后来与奈特太太的交往提升了她们的素质，奈特太太很喜欢她们，对她们很友善。简姑姑那么聪明，不会不知道要撇开自身所有那些可能让人觉得“平庸”（如果可以用这个词的话）的迹象，教会自己至少在与人交往时要更文雅些。两位姑姑（卡桑德拉和简）都是在对上流社会及其方式（我指时尚等）毫不知情的情况下被抚养长大的。如果不是因为爸爸的婚姻把她们带到了肯特，给她们带来了奈特太太的善良——奈特太太是会经常轮流请她们做客的——她们将会远远低于上流社会的标准，哪怕她们本人仍然聪明亲切。如果你讨厌这一切，我请你原谅，但我感到这一切涌到我的笔端，似乎自动前来，告知真相。现在差不多是更衣时间了……

我是你永远亲爱的、最友爱的

姐姐F．C．K．

这封信激起了奥斯汀信徒的义愤，他们宣称纳奇布尔夫人写信时已经老迈昏庸了。但是这封信里丝毫没有老迈昏庸的迹象。何况莱斯太太如果觉得她姐姐身体状况无法回答提问，自然也不会写信向她询问。在奥斯汀的信徒看来，范妮简直忘恩负义，简那样宠她，她却这么说简。孩子看父母和长辈，不像父母和长辈看孩子一样怀有同等程度的爱，这很遗憾，但这是事实。父母和长辈如果对此怀有期待的话，那也很不明智。我们都知道简终生未婚，她给范妮的是她如果结婚会给自己孩子的母爱。她很爱孩子，孩子们也最喜欢她。他们喜欢她活泼好玩，喜欢她讲的那些长长的细节详尽的故事。她和范妮成了挚友，范妮可以跟她说可能无法跟父母说的话，因为她父亲已经变成了一名乡绅，整天忙于那些属于乡绅的事，而她母亲则在不断怀孕生产。可是孩子们的眼睛是敏锐的，很容易做出残酷的判断。爱德华·奥斯汀继承了哥德莫山姆和查顿，他就飞黄腾达了，他的婚姻也使他和郡里那些最好的家族建立起了联系。我们不知道简和卡桑德拉如何看待嫂子。查普曼博士还宽容地暗示，妻子的死使爱德华感到“他应该为母亲和妹妹多做点什么，这促使他向她们奉献自己产业上的一幢村舍供她们居住”。而事实上，他很早就拥有了这些产业，有十二年之久了。在我看来，更有可能的情况是，他妻子认为只要他们时不时地请婆家人来住一住，就已经为婆家人做得足够多了，因此并不欢迎她们永久定居在自己家门口。是她的死给了他自由，让他能按自己的意志处理自己的财产。如果情况果真如此，那就逃不过简锐利的眼睛，就有可能启发了简，写下了《理智与情感》中那些描述约翰·达什伍德如何对待继母及继妹的段落。简和卡桑德拉是穷亲戚，如果她们受邀去和有钱的哥嫂常住，去坎特伯雷陪奈特太太常住，去古德尼斯通陪布里奇夫人——她们嫂子的妈妈——常住，那么她们的东道主就不可能对这种善意无知无觉。我们很少有人能在为别人做好事的同时自己却毫无所获。每次简去陪伴奈特老太太，后者总会在陪伴结束时给她点“小费”，而简也总是乐意接受。在一封给卡桑德拉的信中，简说爱德华哥哥给了她和范妮一人五镑。五镑给一个还没长大的女儿是个可爱的小礼物，给家庭女教师是仁慈，给妹妹就是居高临下了。

我很肯定奈特太太、布里奇夫人、爱德华和他妻子都对简很好，都喜欢她，他们怎么可能不呢，但他们仍有可能觉得这两个妹妹是达不到上流社会的标准的，如此假设并非不合理。姐妹俩都很土气。十八世纪时，那些从没离开过乡村和那些每年至少在伦敦住些时日的人之间仍有很大差距，这个差距给喜剧作家们提供了最丰富的创作素材。《傲慢与偏见》中，宾利姐妹鄙视班尼特姐妹的不时髦；可另一方面，伊丽莎白·班尼特也觉得她们做作，对此很不耐烦。实际上班尼特姐妹比奥斯汀姐妹的社会地位还高一个等级，因为班尼特先生虽不富裕，却拥有土地，而尊敬的乔治·奥斯汀却只是个贫穷的乡村牧师。

如果说这样的家教，造成简在肯特郡的贵族淑女们眼中稍微缺了点文雅，那也不算什么稀奇。如果简确实如此，而这又逃过了范妮敏锐的眼睛，我们可以肯定范妮的妈妈也会予以指出。简为人坦率直言，我敢说她经常放纵她率直的幽默感，令那些毫无幽默感的女士无法欣赏。如果她告诉她们她在信里写给卡桑德拉的那些话，说她对谁是通奸女有很强的鉴别能力，那我们大可想象这些女士的尴尬。简生于一七七五年，离《汤姆·琼斯》的出版只不过过去了二十五年，没理由假设在这期间农村的风气就大变了。简的行为举止很可能就像纳奇布尔夫人五十年后说的那样，“远不及上流社会的标准”。从纳奇布尔夫人所说的话进行判断，简去坎特伯雷和奈特太太做伴时，老太太可能暗示过她怎样的行为举止才能让她显得更“文雅”些。很可能正因如此，她才在小说里如此重视良好的教养。今天，像她一样写同一阶层的小说家们可能早就把这点看成理所当然了。就我个人而言，我看不出纳奇布尔夫人的信有何不妥。她的话自笔端“自动前来，告知真相”。这又怎么了？如果有人猜测简说话带有汉普郡口音，举止缺乏某种文雅，穿着家里做的衣服，品味很差，我也丝毫不觉得被冒犯。我们确实从卡罗琳·奥斯汀(9)的《回忆录》中得知，她家人都认为，姐妹俩虽然对穿着很感兴趣，穿得却并不好，但是没说到底是土气还是不合适。写过回忆简·奥斯汀文章的家里人也都小心翼翼地对此赋予比事实更多的社会意义，但这是不必要的。简·奥斯汀一家是值得尊敬的、诚实的好人，属于中上阶层的边缘。如果她家的地位能更稳固些，他们说不定就不那么在意自己的阶层了。正如纳奇布尔夫人所说，奥斯汀姐妹和她们身边最常交往的那些人在一起时很轻松，而那些人在纳奇布尔夫人看来是绝对不属于上层社会的。当姐妹俩面对出身更高的人，比如宾利姐妹这样的时髦女人时，出于自我保护的原因，她们会采取一种批判的态度。我们对乔治·奥斯汀牧师一无所知。他妻子似乎是个好女人，但是有点蠢，还老受疾病困扰，女儿们对她的病看起来既善加照顾，又不乏嘲讽。她活到了差不多九十岁的年纪。儿子们在步入社会前大概沉浸于乡村所能提供的那些享乐之中，如果能借到马，他们会去骑马纵狗打猎。

奥斯汀—雷(10)是第一个替简·奥斯汀作传的人。他书里有一段话，再加点想象，我们可以从中得知简在汉普郡度过的漫长安静的岁月是一种什么样的生活。他说：“可以说，当时有一个普遍的情况是，留给仆人去处理和执行的事比现在少，男女主人亲自去做和监督的事比现在多。关于女主人，我相信普遍认为……她们会亲自参与高级些的烹饪，参与家酿葡萄酒，以及蒸馏药草以制作家用药物的活计……女士们不会轻视纺线的营生，因为家用的亚麻布就是这么织出来的。早餐和茶点后，有些女士喜欢亲自动手洗濯她们的高级瓷器。”从书信中也可得知，奥斯汀家有时连一个仆人都没有，有时只能勉强用一个什么都不懂的小丫头。卡桑德拉做饭，不是因为女士们“留给仆人处理和执行的事少”，而是因为根本就没有仆人做饭。奥斯汀家既不穷也不富。奥斯汀太太和女儿们穿的大部分衣服都是自己做的，女儿们还给哥哥做衬衫。她们自己在家做蜂蜜酒，火腿也是奥斯汀太太熏的。快乐很简单，最兴奋的事就是那些有钱的邻居开舞会。在英国，在那遥远的过去，数百个家庭就过着这样安详、单调和朴实的生活，而其中的一个家庭居然就莫名其妙地诞生了一个天赋异禀的小说家，这难道不是奇事一桩吗？

简为人真实。她年轻时爱跳舞、调情和演戏。她喜欢相貌英俊的年轻男子。她对衣服、帽子和围巾有着强烈的兴趣。她善针线，“一般活计和绣花”都行，这一定让她受益匪浅，因为她改过旧长袍，也曾用半条不要的裙子做过帽子。她哥哥亨利在《回忆录》中说：“但凡用手指做的事，简·奥斯汀都能做得很成功。玩挑棒游戏时，我们谁都没法像她似的能把棒撒得那么圆，或者像她似的手那么稳地把棒抽出来。她的杯球(11)表演也堪称神奇。我们在查顿玩的是那种简单的杯球，我们知道她有一回玩的时候曾经连续接球一百次，直到手都酸了。她有时眼睛疲劳，没法长时间读书写作时，会从这个简单的游戏中寻找消遣。”

真是一幅迷人的画面。

没人会把简·奥斯汀说成是个女学究，她对这种类型的女人没什么好感，但是她也明显不是那种没文化的妇女。事实上，她受到的教育就是她那个时代、她那种社会地位的女性都会受到的教育。研究她小说的权威学者查普曼博士根据已知她读过的书列过一个书单，结果很惊人。她当然是读小说的，比如范妮·伯尼、埃奇沃思小姐和拉德克利夫夫人的小说，包括《奥多芙的秘密》。她还读从法语和德语翻译过来的小说，比如歌德的《少年维特之烦恼》。除此之外，只要是能从巴斯和南安普敦的租书铺租到的小说，都在她的书单上。但是她不只对小说感兴趣，她还熟知莎士比亚的作品。当代作家中，她读司各特和拜伦的作品，但她最喜欢的诗人似乎是考珀。这很自然，考珀的诗冷静、优雅、明智，是会吸引到她的。她还读约翰逊和鲍斯威尔的作品，读很多历史书籍，还有各种类型的文学作品。她喜欢朗读，她的声音据说很悦耳。

她还读布道词，尤其喜欢十七世纪一位名叫舍洛克的牧师写的布道词。这事初听似乎令人惊讶，但其实也没什么大不了的。我幼时曾在乡间的一处牧师居所生活过，那里的书房架子上就塞满了装帧精良的布道集。如果布道词能出版，说明它们卖得掉，既然卖得掉，就说明有人读。简·奥斯汀信神而不虔信。当然，她周日去教堂，领圣餐。而且毫无疑问，不管是在史蒂文顿，还是在哥德莫山姆，每日晨昏，奥斯汀一家一定都会共诵祈祷词。但是，正如查普曼博士所说：“这已然不是一个宗教狂热的时代。”正如我们今天每天洗澡，早晚刷牙，不如此就觉得难受一样。我想，对简·奥斯汀和与她同时代的大多数人而言，既然已经用恰当的热情履行了宗教职责，那就可以把与宗教有关的问题放到一边了。就像我们会把一件暂时无用的衣服放到一边一样，把宗教放到一边可以让她在一天和一周剩下的时间里，全心全意、问心无愧地照顾俗事。“福音教派还未形成。”绅士之家早为小儿子安排好了生计，办法就是让他领圣职，给他一份薪俸。他内心是否受到神的召唤是不重要的，但他住的房子应该宽敞方便，他的收入应该恰如其分，这才是最重要的。一个人既领了圣职，就该履行职责。简·奥斯汀当然相信牧师“应该住在他的教民中间，通过对教民的持续关注，证明自己是他们的祝福者和好朋友”。因为她哥哥亨利就是这样做的。亨利机智活泼，是她众多兄弟中最聪明的一个。他曾经经商，有些年还发了大财，但是最后破了产，领了圣职，成了一名模范的教区牧师。

简·奥斯汀对事物的看法与当时的主流观点无异，从其小说和书信中可以得知，她对社会现状是满意的。她毫不怀疑社会应该分阶级，觉得人分穷富是自然的事情。年轻人靠有权势的朋友在为国王服务的事业中得到提升也是正确而合理的。女人的职责就是结婚，当然结婚是为了爱，可是其他条件也得令人满意。这是天下事的正常秩序，没有迹象表明简·奥斯汀认为这其中有任何值得反对的东西。她在给卡桑德拉的一封信中说：“卡洛和他妻子在朴次茅斯过着那里所能想象到的最隐秘的生活，他们连一个仆人都没有。那个女人得多有道德才能答应结这种婚啊！”范妮·普莱斯(12)家之所以生活在粗俗肮脏的环境里，皆因她母亲不谨慎的婚姻导致，这个直观的教训说明一个年轻女子在婚姻之事上应该多多慎重才对。

奥斯汀的小说纯属娱乐性小说。如果你碰巧相信娱乐应该是小说家的主要任务，那你必须把她放到一个单独的类别。比她的小说伟大的作品也有，比如《战争与和平》和《卡拉马佐夫兄弟》，但你读这些作品时必须头脑清楚警醒才能获益。可是哪怕你再疲乏沮丧，读简·奥斯汀的小说都可以让你入迷。

她写作的时代认为女人写作不像话。芒克·刘易斯说：“我对所有女性涂鸦者都有一种讨厌、怜悯和鄙视。她们应该拿的工具不是笔，而是针。针才是她们唯一能熟练操作的工具。”小说这种文学形式并不被尊重，令简·奥斯汀相当震惊的是，诗人司各特爵士竟然也写小说。她“小心地不让她做的事被仆人、客人或除家人以外的任何人怀疑到。她在很小的纸上写，为的是小纸容易收走，或容易用吸墨纸盖上。她家前门和书房之间有扇推拉门，开门时会发出吱嘎声，但她不让人修理这点小毛病，为的就是如果有人来了，这声音会提示她赶快把东西收起来”。她大哥詹姆斯甚至从来都没有告诉他当时还在学校读书的儿子，他读得津津有味的那些书是简姑姑写的。她另外一个哥哥亨利也在《回忆录》中说：“假如她还活着，任何名望的累加都不会诱使她把名字附加到出自她笔下的任何一部作品上。”因此她出版的第一本小说《理智与情感》的扉页上仅仅注明作者是“一位女士”。

《理智与情感》并非简·奥斯汀的处女作，她的处女作叫《第一印象》。她父亲曾写信给一个出版商，问能否出版“一部手稿，是本小说，分三卷，长度类似伯尼小姐的《埃弗莱娜》”，还说出版费用作者可以自付，或采用其他形式。但回信拒绝了这一提议。《第一印象》的写作开始于一七九六年冬，完成于一七九七年八月。一般认为，这本书基本上就是十六年后出版的《傲慢与偏见》。之后，简·奥斯汀又很快连续写了《理智与情感》和《诺桑觉寺》，但运气不好，直到五年后一个名叫理查德·克罗斯比的人才花十镑买了当时叫《苏珊》的《诺桑觉寺》。书他一直未出版，最后又用原价卖给了奥斯汀家。因为简·奥斯汀的小说都是匿名出版，因此他不知道他为了这么一点钱就卖掉的那本书的作者其实和《傲慢与偏见》的作者是同一个人，是那位极受大众欢迎的成功作家。从一七九八年写完《诺桑觉寺》到一八〇九年，简·奥斯汀似乎写得很少，只写了一个名叫《沃森家》的片段。对一个如此富有创造力的作家来说，这段沉默实在太久，原因据说是有一桩恋情占据了她的注意力，使她无暇他顾。据说，当时她和母亲、姐姐在德文郡的一个海边度假地休养，“她认识了一名绅士，那人的相貌、头脑和教养都很出众，卡桑德拉觉得他配得上她妹妹，也有可能赢得她妹妹的爱。他们告别时，他表达了希望能很快再见的愿望，卡桑德拉觉得他的动机很明显，但他们再也没能相见。很快，她们就听说他突然死了。”这段相识时间很短，《回忆录》的作者说他无法判断“她的感情是否已经达到了某种程度，以致影响到了她的幸福”。我并不认为有影响。我也不认为奥斯汀能很深地爱上谁。如果她能，她就会给她的女主人公们以更温暖的情感，但事实并非如此。她们的爱里没有激情，她们的意愿都被谨慎调和，被常识控制，而真爱是与这些可估量的品质无关的。以《劝导》为例，简·奥斯汀说安妮·艾略特和温特沃思二人彼此深爱，可我却觉得她骗了自己，也骗了读者。对温特沃思而言，那无疑是司汤达所说的“激情之爱”，但在安妮这一方，却是司汤达说的“得体之爱”。他们先是订婚，然后安妮允许自己听信那个爱管闲事的势利眼罗素夫人的劝告，认为嫁给一个穷人，一个有可能死于战争的海军军官，是不谨慎的。假如她是真的深爱温特沃思，她当然就会愿意去冒险。而且这也不是多大的险，因为她一结婚就会获得她母亲留给她的那份遗产，足足有三千多镑，等于今天的一万两千多镑。所以无论如何她都不会不名一文。她还可以像本威克上校和哈格雷夫斯小姐那对儿一样，先跟温特沃思订婚，等他有了指挥权能娶她的时候再结婚。可安妮却解除了婚约，因为她听了罗素夫人的劝，认为如果再等等的话，她还能找到更合适的人。直到没有一个追求者是她想嫁的人时，她才发现自己原来深爱着温特沃思。我们可以相当肯定，简·奥斯汀认为安妮的行为是自然而合理的。

关于简·奥斯汀长时间的沉默，最合理的解释是她找不着出版商，因此感到受挫。家人听她朗读自己的作品，都认为她的小说很好，但她这个人非常谦虚，而且很明智，她很可能认为他们之所以喜欢她的作品，只是因为他们喜欢她这个人，他们还很可能精明地知道她人物的原型是谁。《回忆录》的作者坚决否认她的人物有原型，查普曼博士似乎赞成这种看法。老实说，他们在为简·奥斯汀争取一种令人难以置信的创造力。所有的伟大作家——司汤达和巴尔扎克，托尔斯泰和屠格涅夫，狄更斯和萨克雷——都有人物所本的原型。简·奥斯汀确实说过：“我太骄傲于我的绅士们，我不愿承认他们只不过是A先生和B上校。”这里的关键词是“只不过”。和所有小说家一样，尽管某个真人给了她创作人物的灵感，但只要她的想象力已经在这个人物身上发挥了作用，那他就无论如何都成了她的创造，但这不等于说这个人物不是从A先生或B上校那里进化来的。

不管怎样，一八〇九年简·奥斯汀同母亲和姐姐定居于安静的查顿，开始着手修改旧手稿，一八一一年《理智与情感》终于出版了。此时女人写作已经不再是件见不得人的事。司布真教授在皇家文学院所做的关于简·奥斯汀的讲座中，引用了伊莱莎·菲所作的《印度来信》的序言。这位女士一七八二年曾被督促出版这部通信集，但因舆论反感“女性写作”，她只得拒绝。但在一八一六年她写道：“从那以后，公众的情绪及其发展已经逐渐起了相当大的变化，现在我们不仅像以前一样有不少为巾帼增光的女性文学人物，我们也有了一些毫不做作的女性。她们勇敢驾驶小船，到那浩瀚大海上扬帆远航去了，不惧那曾经伴随远航而来的批评的风浪，娱乐或教诲就是在这样的航行中被传达给了阅读公众。”

《傲慢与偏见》出版于一八一三年，简·奥斯汀把这本书的版权卖了一百一十镑。

除了上文提到的三部小说，简·奥斯汀还写了另外三部小说：《曼斯菲尔德庄园》、《爱玛》和《劝导》。她的文名虽然建立在这仅有的几本书上，但坚实稳固。她虽然等了很久小说才得以出版，但一经出版，她迷人的才华就立刻得到了认可，之后连最显赫的人物也都开始一致赞美她。我只引用沃尔特·司各特爵士的话，他的慷慨措辞很具代表性：“那位年轻女士在描绘日常生活中的纠葛、感情和人物方面，极具才能，是我所遇到的人中最突出的。粗糙的模仿我也会，谁都会，但是那种因为描写和情感的真实，使得寻常人、事都变得有趣的精妙笔法，却是我做不到的。”

奇怪的是，这位年轻女士最宝贵的一项才能司各特爵士却没说。她的观察确实透彻，她的情感也非常丰沛，但是让她的观察显得中肯，给了她的情感以活力的，是她的幽默。她的作品题材狭窄，所有作品写的其实都是同一类型的故事。她作品中的人物类型也不算丰富，基本都大同小异，只是变换了观察角度而已。她极有自知之明，没有人比她更清楚自己的局限所在。她的生活经历仅限于乡村社会的一个小圈子，她很满足于处理这样的题材，她只写她熟悉的东西。正如查普曼博士最初指出的那样，她从不曾试图再现男人们单独相处时的对话，因为就事实而言，她是不可能听到这些对话的。

有一点已经被大家注意到，就是她虽然经历了世界历史上最激动人心的一些大事，如法国革命、恐怖统治、拿破仑的崛起与败落，她在小说中却对此只字不提。为此她受到指责，说她过分冷漠。但是应该记住，在她那个时代，女人过分关注政治是没教养的表现，政治是男人该管的事，女人甚至都很少读报。不过我们没理由假设：因为她不写这些事，她就不受政治的影响。她很爱她的家人。她有一兄一弟都在海军，经常身处危险之中，她的信件表明她很关心他们。她不写这些事难道不正说明她明智吗？她很谦虚，不觉得她死后还会有人读她的小说。假如这真是她的目的，那她不写这些事就太明智了，因为从文学的角度看，这些事的吸引力不会持久。早几年写“二战”的那些小说现在不是早就过时了吗？这些小说就像日复一日告诉我们当天发生了什么事的报纸一样昙花一现。

大多数小说家写东西都是有好有坏。简·奥斯汀是我知道的唯一例外，她证明了一个道理，即只有平庸之辈才始终维持在同一水准——平庸的水准，而她却从来都不会太偏离自己的最高水准。即使《理智与情感》与《诺桑觉寺》中有许多可指摘之处，但还是让人喜欢的地方多。简·奥斯汀其他的小说也都有热烈的甚至狂热的崇拜者。麦考利(13)认为《曼斯菲尔德庄园》是简·奥斯汀最好的作品；另一些同样著名的读者喜欢《爱玛》；狄士累利(14)读过十七遍《傲慢与偏见》；今天则有人认为《劝导》是简·奥斯汀最精妙的小说。我想绝大多数读者会认为《傲慢与偏见》是她最杰出的作品，在这种情况下，我认为不如接受他们的判断。一本书是否能成为经典，不在于评论家的赞美、教授的解读和学校的研究，而是一代接一代、数量众多的读者能否从中获得乐趣和精神的益处。

我个人认为《傲慢与偏见》是简·奥斯汀所有小说里最令人满意的一本。开篇的第一句话就让人感到痛快：“有一个真理举世皆知，那就是一个有钱的单身汉一定缺个太太。”这话为全书定了调，它所引起的好心情会一直陪伴你读到最后一页，然后你会遗憾这本书居然就这么完了。《爱玛》是简·奥斯汀的小说里唯一让我觉得太过冗长的一部。我对弗兰克·丘吉尔和简·费尔法克斯的恋爱实在不感兴趣。贝茨小姐是好玩，可也未免写得太多了。女主人公是个势利眼，她对那些她认为社会地位低于她的人的那种居高临下的态度真令人作呕。但是我们千万不能指责简·奥斯汀，我们必须记住我们今天读的和她当日的读者读的不是同一本书。风俗和教养的改变使得我们的世界观发生了巨大转变。在某些事上我们比祖先更狭隘，在某些事上更自由。一百年前还很普遍的一种态度，今天却会让我们感到不安。我们通过先入之见和我们自己的行为标准来判断我们所读的书，这不公平，却也不可避免。《曼斯菲尔德庄园》的男女主人公，埃德蒙和范妮，都是令人难以忍受的道学先生，我全部的同情心反而都给了寡廉鲜耻、活泼迷人的亨利和玛丽·克劳福德。我不明白为什么托马斯·伯特伦爵士从海外归来看见家人排戏自娱会勃然大怒。因为奥斯汀本人是非常喜欢家庭演剧的，因此我们不明白她为什么会觉得伯特伦的愤怒是合理的。《劝导》有种罕见的魅力，虽然我们可能希望安妮能少讲求点实际，多点无私，多点冲动，也就是能不那么像老处女似的古板拘谨。要不是因为莱姆里吉斯港口科布码头上的那档子事，我简直都要认为《劝导》是简·奥斯汀六本书中最完美的一本了。简·奥斯汀本就不善于虚构特殊事件，因此这事在我看是个异常笨拙的设计。路易莎·马斯格罗夫跑上几级很陡的台阶，想要跳下来给她的爱慕者温特沃思上校接住。他没接住，她撞到头，昏了过去。我们被告知他是习惯这样接她的，而假如他真要伸手接她，那么即使那时的码头比现在高一倍，也顶多是离地六英尺，她既然是跳下去的，就不可能磕到头。无论如何，她只会跳到这个魁梧的海军军官身上，虽然有可能震一下，吓一跳，但是不可能受伤。可是，她竟然昏迷了，而接下来的慌乱更令人难以置信。打过仗、因赏金发了财的温特沃思上校居然吓瘫了，所有相关人等的反应也都如此白痴，我简直难以相信一向以冷静和坚强对待亲朋好友的疾病与死亡的简·奥斯汀，居然不觉得这个场面极其不合理。

博学机智的评论家加罗德教授说简·奥斯汀不会写故事，“故事”的意思是说一系列发生的事，或者浪漫，或者不寻常。但这不是简·奥斯汀的才能所在，也不是她想做的事。她太理智，她的幽默太活泼，以至于她无法浪漫。而且她感兴趣的不是“不寻常”，而是“寻常”，只不过她用她敏锐的观察、嘲讽和活泼的机智使得寻常也不寻常起来。说到故事，我们大多数人的意思都是指一个前后连贯、首尾相接的叙述，有开头、中间和结尾。《傲慢与偏见》的头开得恰到好处：两个年轻人上场了，他们对伊丽莎白·班尼特和她姐姐简的爱给小说提供了情节，结尾也结得恰到好处：他们结婚了。这是传统的大团圆结局。这种结尾常常受到那些久经世故的人嘲弄。的确，很多婚姻，也许是大多数婚姻，并不幸福。结婚并不能成为任何事的结局，它只不过开启了另一种经验。于是很多作家写小说都从结婚写起，写婚姻的结果，这是他们的权利。但是简单的人把婚姻看成小说的一种满意的结局也还是有其原因的，因为他们有种直觉，认为男女通过婚配满足了生物功能。他们自然会对达到这一圆满的中间过程感兴趣，比如最初如何爱上，后来如何出现障碍、误解，再后来如何山盟海誓。圆满之后，大家的兴趣又转向结果，即男女结合的产物，也就是即将接续他们的后代。对自然而言，每对夫妇都只是这链条上的一环，他们唯一的重要性就在于可以给这链条再添一环。小说家写大团圆结局的理由就在于此。在《傲慢与偏见》里，读者如果知道新郎收入丰厚，将要带领新娘入住豪宅，而豪宅周围有庄园围绕，内部则到处摆满昂贵优雅的家具，那么读者的满意度会有相当程度的提升。

《傲慢与偏见》是一本情节结构精良的书。事情一件接一件地自然发生，无一处让人觉得不合理。不过有一点令人感到奇怪，即伊丽莎白和简的教养、举止良好，可她们的妈妈和三个妹妹却如纳奇布尔夫人说的那样，“远远低于上流社会及其方式的标准”。但是事情必须这样安排，这对故事至关重要。我允许自己好奇：为什么简·奥斯汀不避开这块绊脚石，把伊丽莎白和简写成是班尼特先生第一次婚姻所生，把现在的班尼特太太和三个小女儿写成是二婚的妻女？简·奥斯汀在她所有的女主角里最喜欢伊丽莎白。她说：“我必须承认，我认为，有史以来所有出版的书里的人物有多么令人愉快，伊丽莎白就有多么令人愉快。”假如像某些人以为的那样，她自己就是伊丽莎白的原型，那她就把自己的快活、神采、勇气、机智、敏捷、良好的判断力以及正确的情感都给了伊丽莎白，同时也就不难判断那个安静、和善、美丽的简就是她姐姐卡桑德拉了。达西通常被看作一个可怕的下流坯，他的第一宗罪是他和一群人一起去了一个公共舞会，他却不愿和他不认识也不想认识的人跳舞。这倒也不是多大的罪。伊丽莎白不幸听到了他对宾利说的贬低她的话，但是达西不知道伊丽莎白在听，他可以为自己脱罪，谁让他的朋友非让他做他不想做的事呢。他向伊丽莎白求婚时的确带有一种不可原谅的傲慢，但他这人的性格主要就是骄傲，对自身出身和地位的骄傲，没有了这点，故事也就无从谈起了。而且，他的求婚态度也给了简·奥斯汀机会，展现了全书最充满戏剧性的一幕。可以想象，若是有了后来积累的写作经验，简·奥斯汀将会更恰当地描写达西的态度——非常自然、容易理解的态度，既能引起伊丽莎白的反感，又不用让达西说出那么无礼的话而招致读者的震惊。对凯瑟琳夫人和柯林斯先生的描写可能有些夸张，但在我看来也没有超出喜剧的范围。喜剧看到的生活比日常生活更闪亮，也更冷淡。带点夸张的笔触，也就是闹剧的笔触，通常也不是什么坏事。小心地混杂点闹剧，正如在草莓上撒点糖一样，说不定可以使喜剧性更加“浓郁”。至于凯瑟琳夫人，我们不妨记住，在简·奥斯汀的时代，贵族头衔使其拥有者在面对社会地位低下之人时心生一种极大的优越感。他们不光期待后者对他们抱以最大的尊敬，而且他们也的确得到了后者这样的尊敬。我年轻时认识的某些贵妇，她们那种自以为是的劲儿虽然不至于像凯瑟琳夫人一样露骨，却也相差不远。至于柯林斯，哪怕是今天，谁还不认识几个这样既谄媚逢迎又自高自大的人呢？他们现在学会了装出一副亲切的面孔掩饰这一点，这只能令其更加可憎。

简·奥斯汀不是个伟大的文体学家，但她写得平实不做作，我想约翰逊博士对她的影响可以在她的句子结构中体现出来。她喜欢用拉丁词，不喜欢用平凡的英语词汇。这让她的措辞稍稍带上了一点正式感，但这绝不会令人不愉快，因为它经常会给一句诙谐的话语增添了深意，或给一句恶毒的话语增添了庄重的味道。她笔下的对话可能就像那个时代真正的对话那样自然，虽然在我们看来，可能会觉得这种对话未免僵硬。简·班尼特在说到她恋人的姐妹时，这样说：“她们当然并不支持我与他结交，对此我并不吃惊，因为他本可以在很多方面做出更为有利的选择。”这当然有可能就是她实际会说的话，但我还是觉得那样说话太难以想像了。很明显，现代小说家不会再如此遣词造句了。一字不差地把真实对话笔录下来是很沉闷的，做点改编反而是合理的。相比而言，只是在近些年，小说家们为了追求效果逼真，才开始努力把对话写得尽量口语化。我怀疑让受过教育的人说话时运用排比和对称，语法还要准确，这只是过去的做法，实际上这些人不可能掌握得了这些技巧，我猜读者们已经把这个当成自然而然的事了。

如此一来，虽然简·奥斯汀小说中的对话总有点像书面语，我们必须承认她总是能令她书中的人物说出与本人个性相符的话来。我只记得她出过一次错：“安妮微笑了一下，说：‘我心目中的好伙伴，艾略特先生，是那些聪明多知、谈话丰富之人，我管这样的人叫好伙伴。’‘你错了，’他温和地说，‘这不是好伙伴，这是最好的伙伴。’”

艾略特先生的性格是有缺陷的。但他能如此绝妙地回答安妮，他就一定有一些奥斯汀认为不适合让读者知道的品质。就我个人而言，我非常为这一回答所喜，我宁愿让安妮嫁给他，也不愿让她嫁给那位沉闷无趣的温特沃思。艾略特确实曾为钱跟一个“身份卑微”的女人结了婚，婚后又怠慢了她，他对史密斯太太的态度也很不厚道，但我们毕竟只有女方的一面之词，我们如果有机会知道他的解释，说不定会觉得他的行为是可以原谅的。

简·奥斯汀有一个优点，我几乎都忘了提，那就是她非常好读，比某些更伟大、更有名的小说家都好读。正如司各特所说，她写的是寻常事，是“日常生活中的纠葛、感情和人物”；因此她的书里几乎无事发生，但是当你读完一页的时候，你会急着翻到下一页，想知道下边发生了什么，还是没发生什么，你还是会急切地翻到下一页。能做到这一点的小说家已经具备了小说家所能拥有的最宝贵的天赋了。

查尔斯·狄更斯与《大卫·科波菲尔》


1


查尔斯·狄更斯虽然身量不高，但却仪态大方，相貌讨人喜欢。他二十七岁时由麦克利斯画的那张肖像现藏于英国国家肖像美术馆。画中的他坐在写字台前的一把漂亮椅子里，一只优雅的小手轻放在一部手稿的上面。他穿得隆重，系了个极宽大的绸缎颈巾，褐色的头发自然拳曲，垂在脸颊两侧，刚好盖住耳朵。他的眼睛长得很好，眼里那种深思的表情正是崇拜他的公众所期待的，一个成功的年轻作家应有的样子。画作没表现出的是那些与他有接触的人在他脸上看到的那种活力、炯炯的眼神，以及他心灵和头脑的活动。他一直都有点花花公子的派头，年轻时喜欢穿天鹅绒的外衣和华丽的马甲，系彩色的颈巾，戴白色的帽子，可他从来都没能达到他想达到的那种效果。人们惊讶甚至震惊于他的穿着，认为那既草率又俗丽。

狄更斯的祖父威廉·狄更斯开始是个仆人，娶了个女仆，最后成了克鲁堂的管家，克鲁堂是切斯特城议员约翰·克鲁的家宅。威廉·狄更斯有两个儿子：威廉和约翰，与我们有关的是约翰，首先因为他是英国最伟大的小说家的父亲。其次，因为他是他儿子创造出的最伟大的人物麦考伯的原型。威廉·狄更斯死后，他的遗孀继续在克鲁堂当管家，终于在三十五年的服务后拿着一笔退休金退休了。可能是想离两个儿子近点，她住到了伦敦。克鲁家供她两个丧父的儿子受教育，并给他们提供了生计。他们给约翰在海军出纳室找了个职位，他和那里同为文员的一个同事结交起来，并且很快娶了那人的妹妹伊丽莎白·巴罗。从结婚开始，他似乎就有财务上的麻烦，总是找人借钱，任何人只要蠢到肯借给他，他都借。但是他心地善良，使钱慷慨，他不傻，工作也勤奋，虽然他的勤奋只是一阵阵的。他还极嗜好酒，因为他第二次被捕就是由于欠债被一个葡萄酒商控告了。晚年的他被描述为一个讲究穿戴的老花花公子，永远都在抚摸他怀表上系着的那一大串印章。

查尔斯·狄更斯是约翰和伊丽莎白的第一个儿子，但是是他们的第二个孩子，他一八一二年出生于波特西。两年后他父亲被调到伦敦，三年后又调动到查塔姆。小查尔斯就在查塔姆入学读书。他父亲有几本藏书：《汤姆·琼斯》《威克菲尔德牧师》《吉尔·布拉斯》《堂吉诃德》《蓝登传》《佩雷格林·皮克尔传》，查尔斯·狄更斯把它们读了又读。他自己的小说显示出那些小说对他的影响是多么巨大、持久。

一八二二年，已经有了五个孩子的约翰·狄更斯把家搬回了伦敦。查尔斯被留在了查塔姆，为的是继续上学，几个月后他才和家人团聚。团聚时他发现他们住在伦敦城郊的卡姆登镇，那个房子后来被他当成麦考伯的家写进了小说。约翰·狄更斯此时虽然一年能挣三百多镑，价值相当于今天的四倍之多，但他明显处于比以往更加绝望的窘迫之中，似乎没钱送小查尔斯回学校继续读书了。更令小查尔斯憎恶的是，他被要求看孩子、擦鞋、刷衣服，帮狄更斯太太从查塔姆带来的女仆干家务。得闲的时候他在“被田野和水渠围绕的荒凉之地”卡姆登镇晃荡，也在附近的萨默斯镇和肯特镇闲逛，有时跑得更远，甚至发现了苏活和莱姆豪斯(1)。

家里的情形愈发坏了，于是狄更斯太太决定开设一间学校，招收父母住在印度的孩子。可能是从婆婆那里借了钱，她印了准备分发的传单，派孩子们塞到邻居的信箱里。结果当然没有一个学生上门，同时债务问题变得越来越紧迫。查尔斯被派去典当家里一切还能换钱的物件。那些书，那些对他来说意义深远、无比宝贵的书都被卖掉了。然后詹姆斯·拉默特，狄更斯太太的一个远房姻亲，给查尔斯找了一份工作，让他在自己有一半产权的鞋油厂里打工，每周可以挣六先令。狄更斯的父母千恩万谢地接受了这个安排，却把少年狄更斯伤到了痛处，因为他发现父母居然可以如此如释重负地将他脱手。他那时十二岁。此后不久，约翰·狄更斯因欠债被关进了马夏尔西监狱，他妻子则典当了最后一点能典当的东西，带着孩子们去监狱和他会合了。当时的监狱肮脏拥挤，卫生条件极差，因为坐监的不光有犯人，还有他们的家属。如果愿意，犯人们是可以带家属一起蹲监狱的，但我不知道他们被允许这样做是为了缓解监狱生活的困苦，还是因为那些可怜的家属反正也无处可去。如果欠债者有钱，他所需忍受的最大的不便就是失去自由，在某些情况下，就连这个损失也可以得到缓解。某些特殊的犯人如能遵守某些规定，还大可不住在监狱里。以前，监狱长经常勒索犯人，还野蛮残酷地对待犯人。但是到约翰·狄更斯入狱的时候，那些最恶劣的勒索、虐待犯人的刑法已经被废除了，他能使自己过得足够舒服。他家那个忠诚的小女仆住在监狱外，每天进监狱来给他做饭带孩子。他仍然每周挣六镑，但他根本不想还钱。可以推测，他满足于住在债主够不着的地方，并不特别想被释放。在狱中，他很快就恢复了过来。其他欠债人“推举他做掌管狱内经济的委员会的主席”，很快，从看守到最令人讨厌的犯人，他和每个人都搞好了关系。后来的传记作者们迷惑于一件事，即约翰·狄更斯居然能在蹲监狱的同时继续领薪水。唯一的解释就是政府职员是靠关系任命的，像欠债入狱这种事还没有严重到要部里采取激烈的举措停发他薪水的地步。

父亲入狱之初，查尔斯·狄更斯住在卡姆登镇，但是因为卡姆登镇离位于查令十字街附近的亨格福德码头的鞋油厂太远，于是约翰·狄更斯为他在马夏尔西监狱附近的南华克区的兰特街找了个住处，这样他就能和家人一起吃早晚饭了。他被分配干的活并不苦，只是洗瓶子、给瓶子贴标签、把瓶子系起来。一八二四年四月，威廉·狄更斯的太太、克鲁堂的老管家死了，把积蓄留给了两个儿子。约翰·狄更斯的债（被他哥哥）还清了，他重获了自由。他再一次和家人住到了卡姆登镇，也再一次回到了海军出纳室工作。查尔斯继续在工厂洗了一阵子瓶子，但是约翰·狄更斯和詹姆斯·拉默特吵了一架。“是在信上吵的，”查尔斯后来写道，“因为是我把我父亲的那封信带给他，造成了那场争吵的爆发。”詹姆斯·拉默特告诉查尔斯他父亲侮辱了自己，因此他必须得走。“怀着一种奇怪的、好似压抑的轻松，我回了家。”他妈妈试图让事情缓和下来，好使查尔斯能够保住这份工作和周薪，因为此时薪水已经涨到了七先令，而她非常需要这笔钱。查尔斯却因此永远都不原谅她。“我后来从来没有忘记，也不会和不能忘记，我母亲是如此想让我回去。”他说。但是约翰·狄更斯不同意，他把儿子送进了汉姆斯特德街的一所学校，这所学校有个堂皇的名字，叫“威灵顿堂学院”。查尔斯在那上了两年半学。

很难知道查尔斯·狄更斯到底在鞋油厂干了多久。他二月初到的那儿，六月又和家人回来了。表面看来，他在那待了不过四个月。但是鞋油厂给他留下了深刻的印象，他后来把这段经历看成奇耻大辱，以至于不忍提及。当他的好友和第一位传记作者约翰·福斯特偶然提及了一星半点时，狄更斯告诉他，他触碰到了一件令人非常痛苦的事，“即使是现在，”——二十五年后，“只要他还有记忆，他就无法忘怀。”

我们已经听惯了显赫的政治家和工业巨头们夸耀年轻时如何洗盘子、卖报纸，因此很难理解为什么查尔斯·狄更斯会把父母送他进鞋油厂看成他们给他造成的巨大伤害，看成一个需要他隐藏的耻辱的秘密。狄更斯是个快乐、淘气和机灵的孩子，对生活的阴暗一面已经有了很多了解，很小就目睹他父亲的得过且过把全家人害成了什么样。他们是穷人，过得也像穷人。在卡姆登镇时他被要求打扫擦洗，为了能吃上晚饭，他被派去典当衣服或饰品。他一定曾像所有孩子一样和别的孩子们在街上玩耍过，也曾像当时他那个阶层的所有男孩一样，到了一定年龄就去做工，工资还很不错。他一周挣六先令，很快涨到七先令，这至少等于今天的二十五到三十先令。在一段不太长的时间里他必须靠这笔钱养活自己，但是后来搬到马夏尔西监狱附近可以和家人一起吃早晚饭后，他就只需要自己负担午饭了。和他一起干活的男孩们都很友好，因此很难理解他为什么会觉得和他们交往是件丢人的事。他时不时被带到牛津街去见他祖母，不可能不知道她这辈子是个仆人。也可能约翰·狄更斯是个势利眼，毫无根据地夸过口，但是一个十二岁的男孩不太可能对社会阶层有太多认识。而且我们必须假设，如果狄更斯足够成熟，认为自己比其他的工厂小孩都高一个等级，那他也一定足够聪明，明白他的工资对家里来说是多么必要。我们还以为能挣工资会成为他一个骄傲的资本呢。

因此，我们可以假设，因为福斯特的发现，狄更斯写了这一段生活的自传，并给了福斯特，使我们得知了他生活中这段经历的细节。我怀疑当他的想象作用于他的回忆时，他就充满了对曾经的那个小男孩的同情，他就把痛苦、厌恶和屈辱都给了那个男孩，因为这是如今名利双收、受人爱戴的他认为如果他身处那个小男孩的位置将会感受到的东西。而当他运笔写下那个可怜男孩的孤独，写下他被他信任的人背叛时，一切都历历在目，他仁慈的心流血了，泪水打湿了他的双眼。我不认为他是在有意夸大，他是情不自禁地夸大。他的才华，或者说天才，就在于夸大。正是通过讲述和强调麦考伯性格中的喜剧因素，他才令读者发笑。也正是通过强化小耐尔缓慢衰弱过程中的悲怆，他才能令读者哭。他要是不能把他在鞋油厂度过的四个月写得如此令人感动，那他就不是他——一位那么了不起的小说家了。大家都知道，他在《大卫·科波菲尔》里把这段经历再次写了一遍，再次取得了令人撕心裂肺的效果。就我而言，我认为这段经历并不像多年后他既出名又体面，既是个社交人物又是个公众人物时，劝说自己相信的那样给他带来了那么多的痛苦。我更不信这事对他的工作和生活起到了决定性的影响，虽然很多传记家和评论家是这样认为的。

还在马夏尔西监狱的时候，约翰·狄更斯担心他作为债务未清者会失去他在海军出纳室的工作，于是他恳求他部门的头头，让他以健康不佳为由领取退休金。考虑到他工作了二十年和他的六个孩子，他最后被“同情地”准许每年领一百四十镑的退休金。这对像约翰·狄更斯这样的人来说远不够养家，他还得寻找其他方法增加收入。他会点速记，于是在和报社有点关系的内兄的帮助下，他找了份议会记者的工作。查尔斯·狄更斯则留在学校继续读书，直到他十五岁时去给一家律师事务所跑腿。这次查尔斯似乎不觉得有辱身份，他进入了我们现在叫作白领的阶层。几星期后，他父亲给他另找了一个活，让他在另一个律师事务所当文员，一周能挣十先令，后来涨到了十五先令。他觉得这种生活很沉闷，想要提升自己，就学了速记，一年半后就能胜任民事律师公会的主教法庭的速记员的工作。二十岁时，他已经获得了议会记录员的资格，并且很快赢得了“旁听席上最快、最准确之人”的名声。

与此同时，他爱上了一个银行职员的漂亮女儿玛丽亚·比德内尔。他们初见时查尔斯十七岁。玛丽亚是个轻浮、爱调情的年轻女子，她似乎给了他很多挑逗性的鼓励。他们之间甚至可能有过秘密婚约。她对自己有了个爱人的事觉得既好玩又高兴，但是查尔斯身无分文，她是绝不可能想要嫁给他的。两年后他们情断，二人以真正浪漫的方式归还了彼此的礼物和信件，查尔斯觉得自己的心都碎了。多年后他们再见时，玛丽亚·比德内尔已经结婚多年，她肥胖、平庸、愚蠢。她和著名的狄更斯先生和太太吃饭，于是她成了《小杜丽》中弗罗拉·芬奇的原型，早前她就当过《大卫·科波菲尔》中朵拉的原型。

为了离自己效力的报纸近点，查尔斯·狄更斯在河岸街旁那些肮脏的小巷子里找了个住处，但因为对住处不满，他很快又在弗尼沃旅社找了个没配置家具的房间。可他还没来得及采买家具，他父亲就又一次因欠债被捕了，查尔斯不得不出钱让他待在债务人拘留所(2)。“因为约翰·狄更斯将在一段时间内无法与家人团聚”，查尔斯只得又给家人租了个便宜的住处，自己则带着弟弟弗里德里克勉强住进了弗尼沃旅社那间“四楼后”的房间。“正因为他心胸宽广，使钱大方，似乎很会处理类似的困难，”后来为他作传的乌娜·蒲柏—亨尼斯在她写的那本很可读的传记里说，“他家，后来还有他太太家，那群没骨气的亲戚都指望着他给他们找钱找工作，正如每一个养家糊口的人要负担的那样。”

在下议院的旁听席上干了大约一年后，狄更斯开始写一系列伦敦生活的随笔。这些随笔的最初篇目发表在《月刊》上，后来的篇目发表在《晨报纪事》上。他写这些东西时没有报酬，但却引起了一个名叫马克隆的出版商的注意。于是在狄更斯二十四岁生日的时候，这些文字分两卷出版成书了，名叫“博兹札记”，并由克里克山克绘制插图。第一版问世时，马克隆付给了狄更斯一百五十镑。这本书反响很好，很快就给他带来了再写的邀请。当时有种风潮，就是把幽默的逸事型小说配上滑稽插图，分期连载在月刊上，每期卖一先令。它们是我们现在滑稽连环漫画的远祖，也和我们的连环漫画一样非常受欢迎。有一天，查普曼出版社的一个合伙人登门拜访，邀请狄更斯写一个业余运动员俱乐部的故事，并由一位著名画家绘制插图。这个计划共有二十期，查普曼每期会出十四镑，买下我们现在叫作连载权的东西，以后出了书还会继续付钱。狄更斯说自己对运动一无所知，不认为自己能按要求写得出书来，但“报酬实在难以抗拒”。不用说，结果就产生了《匹克威克外传》。开头的五期不算成功，但是山姆·维勒这个人物一出现，发行量就立刻开始激增。到了出书的时候，狄更斯就出名了。虽然评论家们还有所保留，但狄更斯的声名已然确立无疑。不妨看看《评论季刊》是如何说他的：“无须预言的神力就可测知他的命运——他已然像火箭一样飞升，也将像棍子一样跌落。”的确，终其一生，虽然公众都在贪婪捧读狄更斯的书，评论家们却一直对他挑剔不断。

一八三六年，《匹克威克外传》第一期出版前几天，狄更斯和他在《晨报纪事》的同事乔治·贺加斯的大女儿凯特结婚了。乔治·贺加斯是六子八女之父，女儿们都是蓝眼睛、娇小丰满、健康明艳的长相。凯特是唯一到了适婚年龄的女儿，这似乎是狄更斯娶她而不是别人的原因。短暂的蜜月期后，他们在弗尼沃旅社安顿下来，并且邀请凯特的漂亮妹妹、十六岁的玛丽和他们同住。狄更斯签了合同要再写一部小说《雾都孤儿》，《匹克威克外传》还在进行中时他就开始了《雾都孤儿》的创作。两本书都是连载，于是他半个月写这本，半个月写那本。大多数小说家都会情不自禁地沉浸于他正在写的人物当中，还会有意控制，不让脑子里产生其他文学想法，狄更斯却明显可以在两个故事中自由转换，这实在是个了不起的本事。

他喜欢上了玛丽。当凯特发现自己怀了孕，不能陪狄更斯到处走动的时候，玛丽就成了他形影不离的人。凯特的孩子出生了，因为她还会再生几个，因此他们把家从弗尼沃旅社搬到了道提街的一处寓所。一天天过去了，玛丽越长越可爱，越长越讨人喜欢。五月的一个晚上，狄更斯带凯特和玛丽去看戏，他们看得高兴，回来时也兴致勃勃。可是突然间玛丽就病倒了，医生来了，可是几小时后玛丽还是死了。狄更斯把她手上的戒指摘下来戴在自己手上，并且至死都戴着这枚戒指。他悲痛难抑。不久后他在日记中写道：“如果现在她还和我们在一起，还是那个迷人、快乐、亲切的伴侣，比任何我知道的人——不管是过去还是将来——都更理解我一切的思想和感情，那么只要这样的幸福继续下去，我将一无所求。可是她走了，我祈求上帝用他的仁慈，有朝一日可以让我与她重聚。”这些话很重要，昭示的意义深远。他还计划死后与她合葬一处。我想他无疑是深深爱上了玛丽，但我们无法得知他自己是否意识到了这一点。

玛丽死时，凯特又怀孕了，妹妹的死使她受了打击，以致流产了。当她身体康复后，狄更斯带着她出国短期旅行，为的是两个人都能恢复精神。无论如何，到了夏天的时候，他就好得很了，可以跟一位埃莉诺·P．肆意调情了。

写了《雾都孤儿》、《尼古拉斯·尼克贝》和《老古玩店》的狄更斯稳步走在事业成功的路上。他是个勤奋的人，有好几年的时间都是一本书还没写完就开始写另一本。他写作是为了取悦读者，因此会密切关注公众对每期连载的反应，他的很多小说最初都是以连载形式发表的。有一点很有趣，就是他并没有打算让《马丁·翟述伟》在美国出版，直到销量的不断下降证明这次的连载不像以往的连载那么吸引人。他不是那种认为流行等于羞耻的作家，他的成功是巨大的。但是一个获得成功的文人，他的生活通常不是充满变故，而是一成不变的。他所从事的职业要求他每天必须花一定的时间在工作上，于是他发现了一个适合自己的模式。他认识了不少当时的名人，有文学界、艺术界和社交界的。他被贵妇们提携，他参加聚会，也举办聚会，他旅行，他在公众跟前露面。这基本上就是狄更斯的生活模式。确实，他所享受的成功很少有作家能有幸享受。他似乎精力无限。他不仅能快速连续地写出长篇小说来，他还办杂志、编杂志，甚至在某个短时段内还编过一份日报。他写过相当多数量的随笔，他做讲座，在宴会上发表讲话，后来还举办他作品的朗诵会。他骑马，觉得一天步行二十英里不算什么，他满怀热情地跳舞、装傻，他变魔术逗孩子们玩，还在业余剧团表演。他一直都迷恋戏剧，一度还认真想过要登台表演。他当时曾向一个演员学朗诵、背台词，在镜子前练习如何进屋、落座、鞠躬。可以猜想，当他被介绍给上流社会时，这些技能一定对他起了作用。然而，吹毛求疵者仍然认为他有点粗俗，认为他的穿衣风格过分招摇。在英国，说话口音总是能暴露一个人的出身。而几乎终生都住在伦敦、生活条件一直都不宽裕的狄更斯，很可能一口东区腔。但是他的好相貌、他明亮的眼睛、他充沛的感情、他的活力和愉快的笑声迷住了公众。他有可能被那些阿谀之词夸得晕眩，但他并没有被冲昏了头脑，反而一直保持着一种迷人的谦虚。他是个亲切热情、令人愉快的人。他是那种总能给人带来欢乐的人。

奇怪的是，他虽然具备强大的观察能力，也慢慢和社会上的居高位者熟悉了起来，却始终没能在小说中创造出可信的此类人物。在狄更斯生前，别人对他最常见的指责之一就是他不知道怎么写绅士。因为他曾在律师事务所工作过，因此他笔下的律师和律师手下的职员特点最鲜明，是他笔下的医生和牧师所没有的。他写下层人士和卑贱者最拿手，因为他的童年就是在这些人中度过的。似乎一个小说家最了解的只能是他早年打过交道的那些人，他也只有用他们当原型才能创造得出人物来。一个孩子的一年，一个少年的一年，比一个成年人的一年要长得多，他好像因此被赋予了世界上所有的时间，让他去了解他生活环境中那些人的各种怪癖。“很多英国作家之所以完全不会描写上流社会的生活，理由很可能是因为，”亨利·菲尔丁写道，“他们实际上对上流社会的生活一无所知……这些高级阶层的人们不像人类这个物种的其余成员一样，可以在街道上、商店里和咖啡馆里被人白白看到；他们也不像高级动物那样被展出，你花点钱就能看一次。简而言之，没有以下的这两种资格，即头衔或财富，或没有和以上两者等价的一个令人尊敬的职业：赌徒，谁也别想见到这些上流人士。此外，对世界来说很不幸的是，拥有这些资质的人很少会从事写作这个糟糕的职业，从事这个职业的通常都是那些社会地位更低、更穷的人，因为很多人认为干这行不需要任何储备。”

待到条件一改善，狄更斯一家立刻就搬到了一个比较时髦的街区的一座新房子里，并从著名品牌公司订购了全套的接待室和卧室家具。他在地板上铺了厚绒地毯，窗户上挂上了带花穗的窗帘。他们夫妇雇了一个好厨师、三个女仆和一个男仆，还配了辆车。他们举办晚宴，来的都是贵族和名人。他们的奢侈程度让简·卡莱尔(3)感到震惊，杰弗里勋爵则给他的朋友科克布恩勋爵写信说他在新房子吃了饭，“对一个有家要养，也无非是才富起来的人来说，这顿饭实在太奢侈了”。狄更斯慷慨的天性决定了他喜欢身边围满了人，他卑贱的出身也决定了他就是喜欢奢华，但这也太烧钱了。他父亲、他父亲家、他妻子家，常常都得让他花钱。部分为了支付这些沉重的花销，他创办了他的第一份杂志《韩夫利少爷的钟》，并为助它顺利启动，在其上连载了《老古玩店》。

一八四二年，他把四个孩子留给凯特的妹妹乔治安娜照顾，带凯特去了美国。在他之前和之后，没有一个作家像他那样受到美国人的重视，但他这次行程也不完全成功。一百年前的美国人虽然随时都有可能贬低与欧洲有关的事物，却对任何针对他们自己的批评都敏感无比。一百年前的美国出版界对任何不幸成为“新闻”人物的隐私，都会无情地侵犯。一百年前在美国，那些渴望出名的人把外国名人看成上帝赐给他们站在聚光灯下的良机，当这个外国人拒绝像动物园的猴子一样被对待时，他们就说这个外国人傲慢自负。一百年前，美国是个言论自由的国家，只要这言论没有冒犯到他人的感情或侵害到他人的利益。美国还是个人人都可以有自己观点的国家，只要人人也都赞成别人的观点。对这一切狄更斯都一无所知，因此他犯了严重的错误。没有国际版权法不仅剥夺了英国作家在美国的收益，也损害了美国作家自己的利益。因为可以不付英国作家版税，书商们自然愿意出英国作家的书。又因为他们必须付给美国作家版税，因此他们不愿意出美国作家的书。可是狄更斯竟然在欢迎晚宴上的演说中提到了这一点，他实在太不圆通了。公众的反应很强烈，报纸说他“不是个绅士，只是个唯利是图的流氓”。虽然他仍然被崇拜者们簇拥，甚至在费城时和前来见他的人们握手都握了两小时，但是他的戒指和钻石别针，以及他俗丽的马甲还是激起了好一顿批评，另外有些人认为他的举止实在算不上有教养。但是他胜在自然、不装腔作势，很少有人能抗拒得了他的年轻、英俊与快活。他结交了一些好友，至死都和他们保持着亲密友好的关系。

狄更斯夫妇在经过了精彩、疲累的四个月后回到了英国。孩子们对他们的乔治安娜姨妈已经有了依恋，于是疲惫的旅行者请她留下来和他们同住。乔治安娜十六岁，和当年玛丽来到弗尼沃旅社和新婚的狄更斯夫妇同住时一个年纪，乔治安娜长得也像玛丽，远看都可以被认成玛丽。相似度如此高，以至于“当凯特和她与我同坐时”，狄更斯写道，“我觉得发生的一切就像是个忧郁的梦，而我正从梦中醒来。”乔琪(4)漂亮、迷人，不会装腔作势。她有种模仿的天赋，能让狄更斯大笑不止。随着时间的推移，他越来越依赖她。他们会花很长时间在一起散步，他和她讨论他的文学计划，发现她是个有用、可信赖的誊写员。狄更斯的生活方式极为奢华，很快他就发现自己不幸地陷入了债务之中。他决定把房子出租，带全家——当然包括乔琪在内——去意大利，因为那里的生活成本低，可以紧缩开支。他在意大利待了一年，主要在热那亚。他虽然南南北北旅游了不少地方，但他太狭隘，文化底蕴也缺乏，以至于这段经历没有对他的精神产生什么影响，他仍然是个典型的英国游客。但他发现住在外国很愉快，也很省钱，于是开始在欧陆做长久停留。乔琪作为家庭成员也和他们一起来去。一次，狄更斯一家打算搬去巴黎长住一段时间，于是乔琪就单独和狄更斯先去那里找房，而凯特则留在英国，等他们把一切安排好再去。

凯特的性格温和而忧郁，不是个适应能力强的人。她不喜欢狄更斯带她做的那些旅行，不喜欢和他一起参加的那些聚会，也不喜欢她当女主人的那些聚会。她似乎笨拙、无趣，还相当愚蠢，那些急于想要亲近名作家的大人物很可能觉得忍受名作家乏味的妻子是件非常讨厌的事。让她气恼的是，其中有些人总是把她当成一个无足轻重的人。当名人的妻子不是件容易的事，除非她处事圆通，又有一种很强的幽默感，否则不大可能当得好。两样都没有的话，她就必须爱她丈夫，非常崇拜他，才能认为人们对他而不是对她更感兴趣理属应当。她也必须足够聪明，才能在以下事实中找到安慰，即他爱她，不管他多么不忠实于她，他最终都会回到她这里寻找舒适与安慰。凯特似乎从没爱过狄更斯。当年订婚时，狄更斯就给她写过一封信埋怨她对他冷淡。她跟狄更斯结婚，很可能是因为当时婚姻是唯一对女人开放的职业。或者作为八个女儿中的长女，父母给了她压力，让她接受一桩能给她以未来的求婚。她是个友善温柔的小女人，但却无法满足丈夫的地位对她提出的要求。她在十五年的时间里生了十个孩子，流了四次产。她怀孕时，乔琪陪狄更斯旅行，和他一起参加聚会，并且越来越经常地代替凯特坐在餐桌旁女主人的位置上。我们以为凯特会憎恨这种局面，但我们不知道她是不是真的憎恨。

岁月流逝。一八五七年，狄更斯四十五岁了。在他活下来的九个孩子里，大的已经成年，最小的才五岁。他有着世界性的声誉，他是英国最受欢迎的作家，他很有影响力，他活在公众的目光里，这倒很符合他追求戏剧化的本能。一些年前他认识了威尔基·柯林斯，很快他们就发展出非常亲密的友谊。柯林斯比狄更斯年轻十二岁。埃德加·约翰逊曾这样描写柯林斯：“他喜欢美食、香槟和音乐厅，他经常同时和几个女人有着复杂的纠缠，他有趣、愤世嫉俗、好性情，放纵到了近乎粗俗的地步。”对狄更斯来说，柯林斯代表着——仍然引用约翰逊的话——“好玩和自由”。他们一起在英国到处旅游，还同去巴黎找乐子。狄更斯很可能利用了这个机会和碰巧遇到的放荡年轻人——不管这个年轻人是谁——寻了把刺激，就像很多他这个处境的男人都会做的那样。凯特没有给他他所想要的一切，很久以来他已经对她越来越不满意了。“她可爱，温顺，”他写道，“可就是不懂我。”他们才结婚她就开始猜忌他。我怀疑，在他知道她的猜忌毫无理由时，她对他发的那些脾气还好忍受些；可是后来当她的猜忌确有其实时，那些气就不那么好受了。他劝自己说她从来都不适合他。他前进了，她却还在原地。他确信自己无可指责，相信自己是个好父亲，为孩子们做了一切能做的事。事实是，他虽然不太高兴他得养活这么多孩子（他似乎认为凯特一个人应该为生这么多孩子负责），但是孩子们小的时候他还是很喜欢他们的，长大后不知怎么就对他们失去了兴趣。于是，当男孩们到了适当年龄的时候，他就把他们统统打发去了遥远的异国他乡。这些孩子也的确不是怎么有出息的一群。

如果不是因为一个不可预见的意外，狄更斯和他妻子的关系不会有太大改变。就像很多不和谐的夫妻一样，他们之间可能会疏远，但对外人还是会保持一种在一起的假象。这个意外就是狄更斯恋爱了。我曾经说过，狄更斯对舞台情有独钟，他曾不止一次为了慈善的原因在这个或那个剧中业余演出。眼下他受邀在曼彻斯特的一个剧中表演，剧名叫《冰渊》，是柯林斯在他的帮助下写成的。这出戏曾在伦敦的德文郡府当着维多利亚女王夫妇和比利时国王的面成功演出过。他的女儿们曾在其中出演女孩的角色，但是现在他既然同意在曼彻斯特重演，就觉得她们在大剧院里的声音不行，观众听不到，于是决定让专业演员演。这样就安排了一个名叫艾伦·特南的年轻女子出演其中的一个角色。这个小女子年方十八，娇小白皙，眼睛湛蓝。彩排安排在狄更斯家，他是导演。艾伦很崇拜他，急切地想讨好他，他很得意。彩排未完，他就爱上了她。他送给她一只手镯，却不想错送到了他妻子那儿，她当然大闹了一场。狄更斯装出无辜受过的样子，就像那种丈夫们在这种尴尬的节骨眼儿上觉得最方便装出的样子。戏如期上演了，他演主角，一个自我牺牲的北极探险者，演得很动情，全场没有不哭的。为了演戏他还留了络腮胡。

狄更斯和妻子的关系越来越紧张了。那个从来都是那么亲切、好脾气、易相处的他现在除了对乔琪，对每个人都变得喜怒无常、烦躁不安、爱发脾气了。他非常不开心，最后他得出结论：他再也不能和凯特同住了；但他的公众地位又使他害怕公开决裂会造成丑闻。他的焦虑是可以理解的。通过他无比赚钱的圣诞书系列，他比任何人都更加希望让圣诞节成为一个象征性的节日，庆祝的不光是家庭美德，还有团结幸福的家庭生活之美。多年来，他以感人的辞藻让读者相信没有一个地方比得上家。情况很微妙，各种建议都被提了出来。其中之一是他们夫妇还住在同一屋檐下，但是凯特将有自己的房间，和狄更斯分开住，不过她还会在他的聚会上充当女主人，也还会陪他参加公开活动。另一个提议是如果凯特留在伦敦，他就去盖德山庄；而如果他来伦敦，凯特就去盖德山庄。盖德山庄是他刚买的一个房子，在肯特郡。第三个提议是凯特去国外。凯特否决了所有这些提议，最后决定完全分居。凯特被安置在了卡姆登镇边上的一幢小房子里，每年有六百镑收入。不久以后，狄更斯的大儿子查尔斯和他母亲同住了一段时间。

这种安排令人惊讶。我们禁不住疑心，就算凯特性情温顺，可能还愚蠢，可她为什么会接受自己被赶出家门，为什么会同意把孩子留下？她知道狄更斯对艾伦·特南的迷恋，我们本以为她手里有了这张王牌，会想提什么条件就能提什么条件。狄更斯在一封信里提到凯特有个“缺点”，他在另一封当时被不幸出版的信里暗示这个缺点是精神病，这“让他妻子以为她离开会好些”。一般认为这些谨慎的说法其实指向的都是凯特酗酒的事实。如果她的猜忌、觉得自己不胜任、不被需要的屈辱感使她拿起了酒瓶，那也无甚稀奇。而如果她确实酗酒成瘾，那么就可以解释为什么乔琪要来管家看孩子，为什么孩子们留在了家里而他们的母亲却离开了，为什么乔琪会写：“可怜的凯特不能照顾孩子，这对任何人来说都不是个秘密。”她大儿子和她同住的原因大概是要看着她，不让她喝太多。

狄更斯太有名了，他的私事不可能不引人闲话。谣言如丑闻般散布得到处都是。他听见贺加斯家——凯特和乔琪的妈妈和姐妹们——都在说艾伦·特南是他的情妇。他大怒，威胁要把凯特赶出家门，一分钱都不给，以此强迫他们签一个声明，说他们不相信他和那个小演员之间有何不妥。贺加斯家花了两个星期时间才接受被如此威胁。他们一定知道，如果狄更斯把他的威胁付诸实际，凯特可以诉诸法律，他们铁定会赢。而他们不敢让事情发展到这个地步，只能是因为在凯特这方有他们不愿透露的过错。关于乔琪也有很多闲话。她确实是整件事里谜一般的人物，我纳闷是否有人想过要把她作为一出戏的主角。本章早些时候，我提到了玛丽死后狄更斯在日记里写的那些话的重要含义。在我看来，这些话的意思很明确，不仅说他爱上了玛丽，还表示他已经对凯特不满了。当乔琪被邀请去和他们夫妇同住的时候，他被她迷住了，因为她和玛丽长得太像了。他是否也爱上了她？她爱他吗？没人说得清。乔琪相当嫉妒凯特，狄更斯死后，她编选了狄更斯的一些通信，删掉了其中所有赞美凯特的话。但是教会和国家把妻子死后娶妻子的姐妹为妻的做法视如乱伦一般的罪恶，因此她虽然借居狄更斯家长达十五年之久，却可能从未想过在她和这个男人之间还能有超出一奶同胞的姐妹对兄弟的感情。她能获得这样一个名人的信任，还和他建立了这样一种完全的支配关系，可能就够了。整件事最奇怪的部分是当狄更斯热烈地爱上了艾伦·特南时，乔琪居然和她交上了朋友，还欢迎她来盖德山庄。不管她心里是怎么想的，她始终都没说出口。

狄更斯和艾伦·特南的关系被那些知道内情的人私下里谈论着，以至于事情的细节都无法确定。她似乎对他的追求拒绝了一段时间，但是最后屈服于他的坚持。一般认为，狄更斯以查尔斯·特林汉姆的名字在佩卡姆为她租了一所房子，她一直住在那里，直到他死。按照狄更斯女儿凯蒂的说法，狄更斯和艾伦·特南有个儿子。可是关于这个儿子谁也没再听说过更多的事，不妨假设他死于襁褓中了。据说艾伦的屈服并没给狄更斯带来想象的那种欣喜若狂之感。他比她大了二十五岁还不止，不可能不知道她不爱他。世上没有几件事比得不到回报的爱更令人难受了。他在遗嘱中给她留了一千镑，她后来嫁给了一个牧师。她告诉一个名叫贝汉姆的教会朋友，“只要想到”狄更斯强加给她的“亲密”，她就觉得“恶心”。像很多女性一样，她似乎很愿意接受她那个位置的特权，却不明白为什么会有人想要让她作出回报。

大约就在狄更斯和他太太决裂的时候，他开始举办他作品的朗诵会。为此他在英伦三岛巡回演出，并再次去了美国。他的表演天赋使他受益匪浅，他的朗诵表演获得了非常惊人的成功。但是他付出的那些努力，还有他经常的旅行，让他疲惫不堪，人们开始注意到他虽然只有四十多岁，看起来却像个老头一样。朗诵表演不是他唯一的活动。在他和妻子分居一直到他去世的十二年里，他还写了三部长篇小说，办了本极红火的杂志，名叫《一年到头》。毫不奇怪，他的健康每况愈下。他开始被恼人的病痛折磨，他的那些朗诵表演也明显把他累坏了。别人建议他放弃，但他不肯。他喜欢出名，喜欢他一露面就带来的那种轰动，喜欢那种面对面的掌声，喜欢能随意左右听众情绪的能力带给他的刺激。他是否觉得要是艾伦看到他的朗诵会挤满了人，人群如此追捧他，可能会更爱他？他决定最后再做一次巡回演出，但在途中他就病得不行了，只好放弃。他回到盖德山庄，坐下来写《艾德温·德鲁德之谜》。但是因为朗诵会的场次缩减，组织者受到了损失。为了补偿朗诵会的组织者，他又接受了在伦敦安排的十二场朗诵会。这是一八七〇年一月份的事。“圣詹姆斯堂的观众多极了，有时当他出场和退场时，观众会一同起立喝彩。”回到盖德山庄后，他继续写小说。六月的一天，他正单独和乔琪吃饭，不想突然发病了。乔琪派人去叫医生，并把他在伦敦的两个女儿叫了回来。隔天，小点的那个女儿凯蒂被她机智能干的姨妈派去向她妈报告说她爸要死了。随后，凯蒂连同艾伦·特南回到了盖德山庄。之后第二天，也就是一八七〇年六月九号，狄更斯死了，被葬在西敏寺。

马修·阿诺德曾在他的一篇著名文章中坚持说，诗歌要想真正优秀需得具备高度的严肃性。他认为乔叟缺乏这种严肃性，因此尽管他对乔叟赞美有加，却拒绝在最伟大的诗人行列中给他留下一席之地。阿诺德太严肃，看待幽默时未免带了丝疑虑。我不认为有谁能说服他承认，拉伯雷的大笑中可能也包含着类似弥尔顿想要向世人昭示天道一样的严肃。但是我明白他的意思，而且我认为这个意思不光适用于诗歌。可能正因为狄更斯的小说缺乏这种高度的严肃性，因此即使其优点众多，仍会使我们有一丝不满。我们今天再读他的小说，会惊讶于他的幼稚，因为我们的脑子里已经有了伟大的法俄小说的印象，而且不光是法俄小说，乔治·艾略特的小说也给我们留下了印象。和这些小说比，狄更斯的小说简直还未成年。但是我们必须记住，我们现在读的并不是他当年写的小说。因为我们已经变了，那些小说也和我们一样变了。我们不可能再次捕捉到这些小说新鲜出炉时狄更斯的同代人读它们的感受。关于这点，我将引用乌娜·蒲柏—亨尼斯书中的一段话加以证明。“亨利·希登斯太太是杰弗里勋爵的一个邻居和朋友。有一次她向杰弗里的书房窥探，发现杰弗里正趴在桌上，他抬起头的时候满眼是泪。她请他原谅，说：‘我不知道你收到了坏消息，或者你有令你悲痛的理由，否则我就不来了。是谁死了吗？’‘是的，确实有人死了，’杰弗里勋爵回答道，‘我知道我这么动情很傻，但我真的是情不自禁。你知道了也一定会难过：小耐尔，博兹的小耐尔死了。’”杰弗里是个苏格兰法官，《爱丁堡评论》的创办者，一个严厉刻薄的评论家。

就我而言，我虽然还是觉得狄更斯的幽默非常有趣，但他的悲怆让我觉得冷，让我提不起兴趣。我会说他感情强烈，但他没有心。我得赶快纠正。他对穷人和受压迫者有一颗慷慨的心和极大的同情，我们还知道，他一直持续有效地关注着社会改革。但他的心是一颗演员的心，我说这话的意思是，他可以强烈地感受到某种情感，他也希望表达这种情感，就像一个悲剧演员能够感受到他想要表达的那种情感一样。“赫库芭(5)对他算得了什么，他又对赫库芭算得了什么？”这让我想起多年前莎拉·伯恩哈特(6)剧团的一个女演员对我说的话。有一次这位大艺术家（莎拉·伯恩哈特）饰演费德尔(7)，正说到她最感人的一段台词时，在所有人看来她悲痛得都要发疯了，结果她发现舞台一侧有几个工作人员正在大声交谈，于是她向那几个人的方向走去。她转身背向观众，做出在悲痛中把脸藏起来的样子，其实她是在向那几个人嘶吼，法语的意思是：别你妈吵了，你们这帮讨厌的浑蛋。然后，她向观众转过身来，做出一副极度悲伤的姿态，继续她那激烈的长篇演说，直至它令人敬畏地结束。观众什么也没察觉到。很难相信她如果不是真的感受到台词的意思，她能如此高贵、悲壮地说出这些台词，但是她的感情是一种专业的感情，就像皮肤一般浅，只关神经，不关心灵，对她的自控毫无作用。我不怀疑狄更斯是真诚的，但那是一种演员的真诚，这可能也就是为什么不管他怎么堆砌痛苦，我们都觉得他的抒情并不发自内心，都不再被他打动。

但我们无权要求一个作家给予他不具备的东西。如果狄更斯缺乏马修·阿诺德所要求的最伟大的诗人应该具备的高度严肃性，他也还有别的很多东西。他是个很伟大的小说家，他的天赋极高，他认为《大卫·科波菲尔》是他所有作品中最好的一部。虽然作家并不总是能对自己的作品做出公正的判断，但狄更斯对此书的判断在我看来却是正确的。我想每个人都知道，《大卫·科波菲尔》在很大程度上带有自传性质，但是狄更斯写的是小说，不是自传，因此他的取材虽然很多来源于他自己的生活，但他只是把这些素材用于小说创作。对于其余部分，他则依赖自己生动的想象力。他从来都不是个阅读者，文学对话使他厌烦，他后来接触到的文学似乎对他无甚作用，没能消除掉他幼时在查塔姆读到的那些书留给他的深刻印象。从长远看来，我认为那些书中对他影响最大的是斯摩莱特的小说。斯摩莱特向读者展示的那些人物与其说高大夸张，不如说色彩艳明；与其说是“人物”，不如说是“气质”。

所以，看人很适合狄更斯的性情特质。麦考伯源自他父亲。约翰·狄更斯在说话上夸夸其谈，在金钱上极不可靠，但是他不傻，也并非无能。相反，他勤奋、温和、亲切。我们知道狄更斯把他写成了什么样。如果福斯塔夫(8)是文学中第一伟大的喜剧角色，麦考伯就是第二伟大的。有人埋怨狄更斯不该给麦考伯安排一个澳大利亚地方法官的体面结局，我认为这种批评不公正。还有评论家认为麦考伯自始至终都应该是一副行事鲁莽、挥霍无度的样子。可是澳大利亚当时是个人烟稀少之地，麦考伯又是个讲究派头、受过教育、说起话来喜欢炫耀夸大的主儿。我看不出为什么他这么个不乏优点的人在这种情况下就不能弄个一官半职。但是狄更斯的厉害之处不只在创造喜剧人物上，斯蒂尔福斯那个圆滑的仆人他也写得很好。此人有一种神秘、邪恶的气质，能让人脊背发凉。尤赖·希普有一种过去叫作“泰晤士河南岸的闹剧感”(9)，但是即便如此，他也一样是个强大、可怕的人物，狄更斯写他的技巧很高超。的确，《大卫·科波菲尔》充满了最多样、最生动、最新颖的人物。文学史上还没有过像麦考伯、辟果提和巴克斯、特莱德、贝特西姨婆和狄克先生、尤赖·希普和他妈那样的人物。他们是狄更斯旺盛想象力的出色创造。他们是那么有活力，那么前后一致，狄更斯对他们的描写又是那么逼真可信，以至于你会边读边情不自禁地信以为真。他们可能并不真实，但是他们鲜活生动。

狄更斯刻画人物的方法通常是夸大其特点、怪癖和弱点，还让他们每个人说一句话或一串话，好把其典型特点深深印在读者的脑子里。他从来不展示人物的发展。整体看来，他的人物开始什么样，最后还什么样。（只有一两个例外，但那时狄更斯所表现的人物性格的变化非常不能令人信服，因为那变化的原因是为了人为地实现大团圆的结局。）如此刻画人物的危险在于合理性的边界似乎被越过，结果就变成了漫画。漫画其实也不错，如果作者给读者看的是一个可以嘲笑的人物，就像你可以嘲笑麦考伯。可是如果作者想让读者同情，漫画就不管用了。狄更斯刻画女性人物从来都不是很成功，除非他可以使其漫画化，比如那个说“我永远都不会抛弃麦考伯先生”的麦考伯太太，再比如贝特西姨婆。朵拉是按狄更斯的初恋玛丽亚·比德内尔刻画的，太傻太幼稚。艾格尼丝是按玛丽和乔琪刻画的，又太好太理智。此外，朵拉和艾格尼丝都极其无趣。小艾米莉在我看来是个失败的形象，狄更斯明显想让我们同情她，可她的结局纯属自找的。她的雄心是想当个“贵妇”，她跟斯蒂尔福斯私奔是因为她以为她能让他娶她，结果她只当了个令他非常不满的情妇：阴郁、爱哭、自怜，时间长了他当然会厌倦她。《大卫·科波菲尔》里最令人不解的女性是罗莎·达特尔。我猜一开始狄更斯是想让她发挥更大作用的，而后来他之所以没这么做，是因为怕会冒犯公众。我只能猜斯蒂尔福斯曾是她的恋人，但是后来抛弃了她，因此她恨他，可又还爱着他，那是一种嫉妒、饥渴、复仇式的爱。狄更斯创造的这个人物到巴尔扎克手里是可以大写特写一番的。在《大卫·科波菲尔》的所有主角里，斯蒂尔福斯是唯一一个“直”写的，取演员们所说一个角色是“直角”的意思。狄更斯给读者提供了一个绝妙的印象，他写了斯蒂尔福斯的魅力、大方、优雅、友好、亲切，他能跟各种人合得来的可爱天赋，他的快活、勇气、自私、没良心、鲁莽、无情。他描绘的这副形象是我们大多数人都认识的一类男人，这类人所到之处都能给人愉悦，可是离开时也都留下了灾难。狄更斯最后给了他一个坏结局，我觉得菲尔丁会更仁慈，因为正如奥诺太太(10)说汤姆·琼斯的那样：“如果女孩们都这么急切，年轻男子也就没什么好指责的了，因为他们所做的无非是天性使然。”今天，小说家不仅要使他的故事情节可信，还得尽可能地逼真。然而狄更斯却不受这样的限制。离开英国多年后，斯蒂尔福斯从葡萄牙坐船回国，居然就在能看得到亚茅斯港时，船沉没被淹死了，而且还正赶上大卫·科波菲尔来此短暂拜访老友。这样的巧合很难令读者信服。如果是为了满足维多利亚时代恶有恶报的要求，斯蒂尔福斯必须死，狄更斯也一定能想出一个更合理的方式。

英国文学的一个不幸是济慈死得太早而华兹华斯死得太晚。另一个几乎同样严重的不幸是，就在我们国家涌现出有史以来最具天赋的一批伟大小说家的时期，那时流行的出版方式却助长了他们漫无边际、冗长啰唆、离题漫谈的倾向，对他们的作品造成了伤害，而英国的小说家们又大多天性如此。维多利亚时代的小说家都是些靠笔谋生的劳动者。他们签的合同要求他们必须写出固定字数的十八、二十或二十四期连载，还必须以某种套路安排叙事，以便每期结束的时候能够诱惑读者购买下一期。他们无疑知道他们所讲故事的主线，可我们也知道，他们在出版前会预先写好两三期，然后按需要写剩下的，相信他们的创造力会给他们提供足够的材料填满剩下的页码。而且他们也承认，有时候他们的创作会失败，会没的可写，这时他们只好尽量写。有时还会发生故事写完了，可连载还有两三期没完的情况，他们只好想办法尽量推迟结局的到来。如此一来，他们的小说当然就会不成样子，冗长拖沓，他们也就只好东拉西扯。

狄更斯以第一人称写《大卫·科波菲尔》。这种直截了当的方式对他有利，因为他的故事情节通常都很复杂，有时候读者的注意力会被转移到与故事主线无关的人和事上去。在《大卫·科波菲尔》中，只有一次这样的冗长的离题，那是当他叙述斯特朗医生与其妻、其母和其妻的亲戚的关系时。这段情节与大卫无关，而且这段叙述本身也很无聊。我猜狄更斯描述这个情节是为了处理两次时间上的流逝，第一次是大卫在坎特伯雷上学那段时间，第二次是从大卫对朵拉失望到她死那段时间。狄更斯对这两段时间都不知如何写是好。

狄更斯没有逃脱半自传体小说的作者经常会面临的难题，即他本人就是书中的主角。大卫·科波菲尔十岁时就被他严厉的继父送去干活了，就像狄更斯本人也曾被他亲爸送去鞋油厂一样。大卫不得不忍受和社会地位低于他的同龄小孩混在一起的“屈辱”，而狄更斯在他提供给福斯特的只言片语的自传里，甚至相信自己也遭受过一样的痛苦。狄更斯竭尽所能想要激起读者对他的主人公的同情。在那条奔往多佛尔的路上，为了表现大卫孤注一掷的心情，狄更斯实在是写得太夸张了。大卫去多佛尔是想要寻求他姨婆的庇护，这个姨婆是个可爱有趣的人物，无数读者都认为狄更斯对这段逃亡的叙述非常动人。我这个人心肠较硬。我奇怪这孩子怎么是个傻瓜，让每个遇到他的人都抢他、骗他。他毕竟在工厂干了好几个月，也曾从早到晚地在伦敦游荡过。厂里其他小孩哪怕社会地位再不如他，也能教会他一两样东西。他还和麦考伯家住过一段时间，为他们典当过这样那样的东西，也曾去马夏尔西监狱看过他们。他如果真是狄更斯说的那个聪明孩子，那么哪怕他岁数再小，也一定能学到一些社会知识，也该有足够的机灵保护自己。但是大卫·科波菲尔不光是童年表现无能，成年后也无法应对困难。他面对朵拉时的软弱，他处理普通家庭问题时的缺乏常识，几乎都令人难以忍受。他还无比迟钝，猜不出艾格尼丝爱他。我没法劝自己相信，就像狄更斯告诉我们的那样，他最后居然成了一个成功的作家。如果大卫写小说，我怀疑他写得会更像亨利·伍德太太(11)，而不像狄更斯。很奇怪为什么他的创造者一点都不把自己的魄力、活力和充沛的感情分给他。大卫长得纤瘦漂亮，还有魅力，不然不可能赢得他遇到的每个人的好感。他还诚实、友好、认真，可他真有点傻。他是书里最没趣的一个人。他在苏活区的阁楼上目睹小艾米莉和罗莎·达特尔之间发生如此可怕的一幕，却因为一个最靠不住的理由而没去制止。他在全书中的表现再没有比此时更糟糕、更不中用、更不能应付尴尬局面的了。这一幕提供了一个很好的例子，说明用第一人称写小说可能会使叙述者被迫陷入一个虚假得令人吃惊的窘境，让人觉得一个小说的主人公实在不该沦落至此，让读者有理由生他的气。如果用第三人称，即从全知的视角来叙述，那么这个场景即使还是一样夸张，一样令人反感，但是会变得可信，哪怕只是勉强可信。但是当然，我们读《大卫·科波菲尔》的乐趣并不起于以下信念，即生活是，或者曾经是狄更斯描写的那样。这不是为了贬低狄更斯。小说就像天国一样有很多个房间，一个作家想让你参观哪间，他就可以请你参观哪间。谁活着的理由都不比别人多，但是你必须让自己适应你被带入的那个环境。读《金碗》和《蒙帕纳斯的布布》(12)时要戴不同的眼镜。《大卫·科波菲尔》是对生活的幻想，它有时充满欢乐，有时透出悲伤。它是由一个有着生动想象力和温暖情义的男人用回忆和心愿得偿的希望写成的书。你读这本书时必须像你读莎士比亚的《皆大欢喜》时怀有一样的兴致，而它所提供的乐趣几乎像后者一样让人感到愉快。

艾米莉·勃朗特与《呼啸山庄》


1


一七七六年，北爱尔兰唐郡的一个年轻农民修·普朗蒂娶妻埃莉诺·麦克劳埃。次年的圣帕特里克节(1)，他们十个孩子中的长子出生了，取名帕特里克，与爱尔兰的守护神同名。修·普朗蒂似乎既不会读也不会写，因为他连自己的名字怎么拼都不确定。施洗记录中，他的名字被写成了Brunty和Bruntee(2)。他耕种的那一小片土地根本不够他养活他那个大家庭，因此他会去石灰窑打工，年景不好时，还会去邻近的一个地主家打短工。可以猜测，修的大儿子帕特里克就在父亲的土地上干些杂活，直到长大能挣工钱的时候，他就当了一个手摇纺织机的织工。可是他聪明、有野心，不管怎么说吧，到十六岁时，他就已经受到了足够的教育，当起了教师，在他出生地附近的一间乡村学校教书。两年后他在庄柏立洛尼的教区学校找到了一份类似的工作，干了八年。关于当年的事有两种说法：一说是卫理公会(3)的牧师们很欣赏他的能力，希望他能深造当牧师，于是捐了些钱，再加上他之前攒的钱，足够他上剑桥学习了。另一说是他离开教区学校后，去了一个牧师家当家教。正是在这位牧师的帮助下，他进了剑桥大学的圣约翰学院。他那时二十五岁，上大学有点老了。他高大健壮，长得不错，他对自己的相貌也很得意。他靠一份助学金、两份奖学金，还有他做家教获得的报酬维持生活。二十九岁那年，他拿到了学士学位，在英国国教会领了圣职。如果真是卫理公会的牧师们帮他上了剑桥大学的话，他们一定后悔这次投资投错了。

正是在剑桥读书期间，他又把自己的姓氏从入学登记簿上的勃兰特（Branty）改成了勃朗特（Bronte），但是当时他还没有用分音符，即字母e上的那两个点。他被任命为埃塞克斯郡的威泽斯菲尔德地区的副牧师，并在那里爱上了一位玛丽·博德小姐。这位小姐年方十八，家境虽不富有，却也算宽裕。他们订了婚，但是不知为何，勃朗特甩了她，据推测大概是因为他对自己的长处感觉良好，认为再等等的话他还能给自己找个更好的对象。玛丽·博德极受伤害。此举大概在教区里给这位英俊的副牧师引来很多风言风语，因为他离开了威泽斯菲尔德，去了什罗普郡的威灵顿当副牧师，几个月后又去了约克郡的哈茨海德任职。他在此地遇到了一个个子小小、相貌平凡的三十岁女子，名叫玛丽亚·布兰威尔。她每年有五十镑的收入，来自一个体面的中产家庭。帕特里克·勃朗特此时已经三十五了，哪怕长得再帅，说话还带点好听的爱尔兰口音，也找不着更好的伴侣了。于是他求了婚并被接受，在一八一二年结了婚。还在哈茨海德时，勃朗特夫妇就生了两个女儿，玛丽亚和伊丽莎白。后来勃朗特被任命到另一个地方当副牧师，这个地方在布拉德福德附近，他们在这儿又生了四个孩子：夏洛特、帕特里克·布兰威尔、艾米莉和安妮。结婚前一年，勃朗特自费出版了一本诗集，名为《农舍诗歌》，一年后他又出了第二本诗集，名为《乡村吟游诗人》。住在布拉德福德附近时，他还写了本小说，叫《林中小屋》。读过这些作品的人说它们毫无长处。一八二〇年，勃朗特被任命为约克郡一个名叫哈沃斯的村子的“永久副牧师”，他一直在这里做副牧师直到去世，他的野心大概得到了满足。他从未回过爱尔兰去看他留在那里的父母弟妹，但他每年会给母亲寄二十镑，直到母亲去世。

一八二一年，结婚九年后，玛丽亚·勃朗特死了，死于癌症。成了鳏夫的副牧师说服了姨姐伊丽莎白·布兰威尔离开她所居住的彭赞斯来哈沃斯照顾他的六个孩子。但他还想再婚，于是在等待了一段得体的时间后，他写信去问博德太太，也就是十四年前他曾恶劣对待过的那个女孩的母亲，问玛丽·博德是否还单身。几星期后，他收到了回信，之后立刻就写信给玛丽本人。考虑到当时的境况，他的信写得自鸣得意、自以为是、油腔滑调、品味很坏。他居然厚颜无耻地说他的旧爱又一次被激发了，他非常渴望见到她。这信实际等于求婚。她的回信很刺人，但他没有被吓倒，又写了封信。他的不知分寸真是令人吃惊，他说：“随便你怎么想，怎么写，但我毫不怀疑，如果你是我的妻子，你会比现在更幸福，或者比你单身生活更幸福。”（下划线部分为他的原文强调的部分。）在玛丽·博德那儿失败后，他把心思转到了另一处，又向一位伊丽莎白·福里斯小姐求婚，他在布拉德福德附近当副牧师时认识了她，但她也拒绝了。他似乎没想过一个四十五岁、带着六个小孩的鳏夫实在不是什么值得婚配的对象。现在，他好像认识到了这是个白费力气的事，于是放弃了再婚的想法。不管怎样，有伊丽莎白·布兰威尔给他管家和照顾孩子，他已经很该感恩了。

哈沃斯的牧师住所是幢褐色的石头小房子，坐落于陡峭的山崖上，山下就是布局零散的哈沃斯村。牧师住所的房前屋后都有一小片花园，两侧则是墓地。勃朗特姐妹的传记作家们都认为这种环境太压抑。对医生来说那种环境可能确实压抑，但对牧师来说，却有可能觉得身处其中能让人陶冶情操，甚至安慰人心。无论如何，这位牧师的家人一定已经逐渐习惯了这番景象，他们很可能已经不再注意了，就像意大利南方卡普里岛的渔夫很少会注意落日余晖里的维苏威火山或伊斯基亚岛一样。房子的一楼有个客厅，有间勃朗特先生的书房，还有一间厨房和一间储藏室，二楼则有四个卧室和一个厅。除客厅和书房外，全屋都没铺地毯，窗户上也不挂窗帘，因为勃朗特先生最怕着火。地板和楼梯都是石头的，一到冬天格外冰冷潮湿。布兰威尔姨妈因为怕感冒，总是穿着套鞋在屋里走动。还有条小路从房子通向荒野。为使勃朗特姐妹的故事更具悲伤的色彩，作家们总爱把哈沃斯写成永远荒凉、苦寒和沉闷的样子，尽管这种想法大概是无意识的。但是即使是在冬天，哈沃斯也有不少天空湛蓝、阳光灿烂的日子。在这样的日子里，冰冷的空气令人精神振奋，草地、荒野和树林都染上了一层柔和的色彩。我就是在这样的一天去了哈沃斯。那天的乡村笼罩在一层银灰色的薄雾中，轮廓模糊，远远看去无比神秘。掉光了叶子的树木有一种日本版画里的那种树木在冬日里的优雅姿态，路边的山楂树丛挂着白霜，闪着银光。艾米莉·勃朗特的诗和《呼啸山庄》会告诉你沼泽上的春天多么令人激动，它的美多么丰富，它的夏天又是多么迷人。

勃朗特先生爱在荒野上长时间地散步，而且走得很远。晚年时勃朗特先生夸口说他一天能走四十英里。他是个躲避人群的人——换换口味也好，因为作为副牧师，他是个社会动物，爱聚会，爱调情。附近的牧师们有时会下山来和他喝杯茶，此外他除了教会执事和教区居民外，什么人都不见。如果这些人来请他，他会去见他们。如果他们要他去主持宗教仪式，他也会欣然从命。但是他和家人“关系非常紧密”。他自己虽然是个贫穷的爱尔兰农民的儿子，却不让自己的孩子和村里的孩子们接触。孩子们全被他赶到二楼寒冷的小厅里，那是他们的书房。他们在那里阅读，小声说话，生怕打扰了父亲，因为父亲被打扰或不高兴的时候，会一直阴沉着脸保持沉默。上午他教他们功课，布兰威尔姨妈则教女孩们针线活和家务。

即使是在妻子生前，勃朗特先生也习惯在书房里单独用餐，这个习惯他保持了一生。他给出的理由是他消化不良。艾米莉在日记中写道：“晚饭我们将要吃煮牛肉、萝卜、土豆和苹果布丁。”一八四六年夏洛特从曼彻斯特写信说：“爸爸不要求别的，你知道，他就只吃清淡的牛肉和羊肉、茶、面包和黄油。”对于一个长期消化不良的人来说，这似乎不是个好的养生之法。我倾向于认为，假如勃朗特先生单独用餐，那是因为他不喜欢子女的陪伴，如果孩子们打扰到了他，他会很生气。每晚八点钟他会读家庭祈祷词，九点钟闩门上锁。经过孩子们在那儿坐着的房间时，他会嘱咐他们不要太晚睡。上到楼梯一半的拐角处时，他会停下来给钟上发条。

盖斯凯尔夫人认识勃朗特先生几年，得出的结论是他是个自私、易怒、专横的人。而作为夏洛特好友之一的玛丽·泰勒也给她的另一个朋友艾伦·纽西写信说：“我一想起夏洛特为那个自私的老头所做的牺牲就不由得又生气又沮丧。”最近有人想要洗白他，可是再怎么洗白都无法粉饰他给玛丽·博德写的那些信中表现出的厚颜无耻，它们已经全文发表在了克莱门特·肖特的《勃朗特一家及其圈子》的书中了。而且，再怎么洗白也不能让人忘了他对他的助理牧师尼克斯向夏洛特求婚时的态度。我稍后还会再谈到此事。盖斯凯尔夫人写道：“勃朗特太太的保姆告诉我，有一天孩子们都去荒野了，天开始下雨，她怕他们会淋湿，就把朋友给孩子们的彩色靴子找出来，一双双围在厨房的火炉边烘烤一下。可是等孩子们回来后，却发现靴子不见了，只能闻到很强烈的皮子烧焦的气味。原来勃朗特先生进来看见这些鞋，认为它们太花哨奢侈，不适合他的孩子，就都给烧了。任何冒犯他古老的简朴概念的东西他都不放过。很久以前，还有人送给过勃朗特太太一条丝绸裙子，不管是颜色、样式还是材质都不符合他对得体的看法，于是勃朗特太太一次都没穿过。尽管如此，她把裙子放在抽屉里珍藏，而抽屉一般都是上锁的。但是，有一天她在厨房，突然想起她把钥匙落在抽屉上了，同时听到勃朗特先生在楼上，她预感到裙子要出事，就连忙跑上楼，结果发现裙子已经被剪成了碎片。”这故事虽是一面之词，可是保姆没理由编故事。“有一次，他把壁炉前的地毯塞到炉子里，故意放在火上，并且一直待在屋里，哪怕味道很臭也不怕，直到地毯闷烧到彻底不能用为止。还有一次，他拿了几把椅子，硬是用锯子把椅背锯掉，直到最后把椅子弄成了凳子。”还必须加一句才公平，勃朗特先生自己说这些故事都是假的。但是没人怀疑他脾气暴烈，严厉专横。我曾经自问，勃朗特先生这些不可爱的性格是否源于他对生活的失望。正如其他很多出身卑微的人一样，他为了提升自己，脱离自己所在的阶层，接受教育，不得不痛苦挣扎，但他很可能高估了自己的能力。我们知道他对自己的相貌相当得意。他在文学上的努力没有获得成功。他这样常年与逆境搏斗的唯一报偿无非是在约克郡的荒野地区永远当个副牧师。如果这事使他怨恨，那也没什么好奇怪的。

在牧师的那所宅子里，生活的艰苦与孤独被过分夸大了，因为才华横溢的几姐妹似乎对这种生活相当满意。确实，如果她们停下来想想自己父亲的出身，可能会觉得自己非常走运。比起全英国好几百名牧师的女儿，她们的处境既不更好也不更坏，因为那些牧师之女的生活也像她们一样与世隔绝，财产也像她们一样有限。勃朗特家是有邻居的，包括步行距离之内的牧师、乡绅、磨坊主、小业主，她们可能跟他们有过交往。如果她们过着隔绝的生活，那是她们有意为之。她们不富裕，但也不贫穷。勃朗特先生的圣禄给他提供了一个住所和一笔一年两百镑的收入，他妻子一年有五十镑，妻子死后他应该继承了这笔钱。伊丽莎白·布兰威尔来此居住时，也把她那一年五十镑的收入带来了。因此家里一年能支配的钱有三百镑，至少等于今天的一千两百镑。如今的很多牧师，哪怕要交所得税，也会把一年一千两百镑看成很大一笔钱。如今很多牧师的妻子要是有一个女仆都会谢天谢地，而勃朗特家平常就有两个女仆，活儿多的时候还会从村里临时招女孩们来帮忙。

一八二四年，勃朗特先生把四个大一点的女儿送到了考恩桥的一家学校。学校是刚建的，为的是给穷牧师的女儿提供教育。这个地方很不健康，食物很差，管理也很糟。两个大女孩死了，夏洛特和艾米莉的健康也受到了影响。但是幸运的是，一段时间后她们被转移走了。从此，她们的教育似乎就都由姨妈负责给予了。勃朗特先生对他独生子的关心多过对三个女儿的关心。确实，儿子被认为是家里最聪明的那个。勃朗特先生不肯送他去学校，他要亲自教。这个儿子早慧，举止也很吸引人。他的朋友F．H．格兰蒂这样描述他：“他个子太矮，这是他人生的一大考验。他有一头浓密的红发，留着背头，梳得很高，我想是为了增加身高吧。他额头很大，很突出，几乎占了整个脸轮廓的一半，显得很聪明。小眼睛像雪貂一样深陷，眼镜从来不摘，把眼睛隐藏得更深了，鼻子很突出，但是脸的下半部分乏善可陈。他有一种沮丧的神情，从来没有变过，除了在很长时间的间隔后抬眼快速瞥一下。他身材瘦小单薄，第一眼看上去实在不起眼。”他有才华，他的姐妹们都期待他做出一番事业来。他父亲是个阴郁沉默的人，而他则是个有才华、热情健谈的人，他一定是从某个爱尔兰祖先那里继承了社交的天赋和令人愉快的健谈的脾性。如果一个旅行者夜宿黑牛旅店，看来有些孤独，店主会问：“你想有个人陪你喝酒吗，先生？我可以叫帕特里克来。”布兰威尔也总是很愿意帮忙。我应该加一句，多年后夏洛特已经成名，店主被问到此事，不承认他曾这么做过。他说：“布兰威尔永远不用让人叫。”今天你去哈沃斯，还会被指点看黑牛旅店的那个房间，那些温莎式的靠椅，布兰威尔当年就是坐在这样的椅子里和朋友们痛饮烈酒的。

夏洛特不满十六岁时，又一次进了学校，这次去的是罗海德，而且过得很愉快。但是一年后她就回了家，为的是教两个妹妹。虽然正如我已经指出的那样，她们家不像一般以为的那么穷，但是女儿们也没什么指望。勃朗特一死，他的薪俸自然就没了，布兰威尔姨妈会把自己那点钱留给她那个有趣的外甥。于是姐妹几个觉得她们唯一能挣钱养活自己的办法就是训练自己当家庭教师或学校教师，这是当时对那些自视为淑女的女人开放的唯一职业。布兰威尔那时也有十八了，他必须决定自己到底要从事何种职业或是经营何种商业。就像他的姐妹们都能画一样，他也有点画画的才能，他于是想当画家。事情决定了，他要去伦敦的皇家艺术学院学画。他去了，但是什么也没学成。他只是观光，一定也还趁机玩乐了一番，这样过了一段时间后，他又回到了哈沃斯。他尝试过写作，但是没成功。之后他说服他父亲给他在布拉德福德开了一间画室，想给当地人画像挣钱，但是这次也失败了，勃朗特先生把他叫回了家。再后来，他去给巴罗因弗内斯一位名叫波索斯韦特的先生当家庭教师。他似乎在那儿干得不错，但是六个月后，勃朗特先生又把他叫回了家，原因未明。很快，家里给他在利兹和曼彻斯特那趟线上的索尔比桥火车站找了个管理员的工作，他后来又去了莱顿顿脚站当管理员。他感到寂寞无聊，于是狂喝滥饮，终于因为严重的玩忽职守被开除回了家。同时，一八三五年，夏洛特回到罗海德当老师，并把艾米莉带去当学生。但是艾米莉太想家，想得都生了病，又被送了回来。性情更为安静顺从的安妮取代了她的位置。夏洛特在这个职位上干了三年，三年后，她的健康变差，她也回到了家中。

夏洛特二十二岁了。布兰威尔不但让家人发愁，还花了家里好多钱。夏洛特一旦健康好转，立刻就觉得她有义务去找一个保姆兼家庭教师的职位。这不是她喜欢的工作。她和她妹妹都不喜欢小孩，就像她们的父亲不喜欢小孩那样。“我发现想要挡住孩子那种粗鲁的亲密太难了。”她在信中告诉艾伦·纽西。她很不喜欢寄人篱下，时时留心有没有人冒犯她，她不是个容易相处的人。从她的信中可以判断，她的雇主认为自然该她做的事，她却认为不在她分内，须得求她，她才会做。三个月后她离开了，回到了牧师住所，可是两年后她又在布拉德福德附近的罗登给怀特夫妇家做了家庭教师。夏洛特认为他们没有良好的教养。“我能相信吗？W太太是个收税官的女儿，我还肯定W先生的出身也很低。”但她在这个职位上干得挺高兴，不过正如她给自己那位密友艾伦·纽西的信中说的那样：“除了我自己，没人知道家庭教师的生活对我来说多么艰难，因为只有我自己知道，我整个的头脑和天性是多么彻底地厌恶这个职业。”一直以来她都有过想和两个妹妹开一间自己的学校的念头，现在她又打起了这个主意。怀特夫妇鼓励了她，他们似乎是对善良体面的人，但是他们建议她应该先取得一定的资质，这样才能成功。她能读法语，但是不会说，也不懂德语，于是她决定出国学语言。布兰威尔姨妈答应垫付这笔费用，于是勃朗特先生亲自送夏洛特和艾米莉去了布鲁塞尔，以便路上照顾她们。两个女孩——夏洛特二十六岁，艾米莉二十二岁——成了埃热寄宿学校的学生。十个月后，她们被召回了英国，因为布兰威尔姨妈病重。姨妈死了，因为外甥的行为太恶劣，她剥夺了他的继承权，把所有那点钱都留给了外甥女。这笔钱足够她们实现长久以来谈论的办学的想法，但是她们的父亲老了，视力不行了，于是她们决定就在牧师居所办这个学校。夏洛特认为她还没有完全准备好，就接受了埃热先生的邀请，又回到布鲁塞尔埃热先生的学校教英语。她在布鲁塞尔待了一年，之后再次回到哈沃斯。再然后，三姐妹发了入学简介，夏洛特还写信给朋友，请朋友们代为推荐她们即将开办的这所学校。她们从没解释过如何能在牧师住所里给学生提供住宿，因为这里只有四间卧室，而她们自己就都占满了。不过既然一个学生都没招来，这事也就不用解释了。

她们自童年起就经常写作。一八四六年，她们自费出版了一本诗集，用的名字是柯勒·贝尔、艾利斯·贝尔和阿克顿·贝尔。出书花了她们五十镑，但只卖掉了两本。然后她们每人都写了一本小说。夏洛特（柯勒·贝尔）写的是《教授》，艾米莉（艾利斯·贝尔）写的是《呼啸山庄》，安妮（阿克顿·贝尔）写的是《艾格妮丝·格雷》。她们被一个又一个出版商拒绝，直到夏洛特的《教授》最终被送到史密斯父子公司。这家公司退回了《教授》，但写信说愿意考虑她写的一个更长一点的小说。可巧她正在写一个更长的小说，而且就快写完了，一个月内就能交稿。史密斯父子公司接受了，这书正是《简·爱》。艾米莉的小说和安妮的小说最终也被一个名叫纽比的出版商接受了，但“条件对两位作者来说无比苛刻”。她们在夏洛特把《简·爱》交给史密斯父子公司前改正了校样。虽然评论界对《简·爱》的评价并不好，但是架不住读者喜欢，这书成了畅销书。一看这样，纽比也试图让公众相信，他以三卷本形式一起出版的《呼啸山庄》和《艾格妮丝·格雷》也是《简·爱》的作者写的。但是《呼啸山庄》和《艾格妮丝·格雷》没给人留下印象，某些评论家还以为它们是柯勒·贝尔早期的不成熟之作。勃朗特先生在经过一番劝说后，答应读一读《简·爱》。当他读完进来喝茶的时候，他说：“女儿们，你们知道夏洛特一直在写一本书吗？而且可能写得还相当不错。”

布兰威尔姨妈死的时候，安妮在索普格林给一位罗宾逊太太的孩子当家庭教师。她的性情亲切柔顺，比起严厉易怒的夏洛特来说，明显更易与人相处，她在这个职位上并非是不开心的。她回哈沃斯参加姨妈的葬礼，回到索普格林时，带去了闲散在家的布兰威尔，让他给罗宾逊家的儿子做家庭教师。这家的先生，埃德蒙·罗宾逊，是个有钱的牧师，虽然年老久病，妻子却相当年轻。布兰威尔爱上了她，尽管她比他大十七岁。他们到底是不是情人并不确定。但是不管他们是不是，他们都被发现了，布兰威尔只好卷铺盖走人。罗宾逊先生命令他“再也不许见他孩子的母亲，再也不许踏入她的家门一步，再也不许给她写信或和她说话”。布兰威尔“咆哮、怒骂、发誓说他离开她活不了，怪她为何不肯离开她丈夫。然后祈祷那个病人快点死掉，说他俩以后会幸福”。布兰威尔一直嗜酒，现下处于悲痛之中更是开始吃起了鸦片。不过他似乎还能和罗宾逊太太联系。在他被开除几个月后，他们似乎又在哈罗盖特见过面。“据说她提议私奔，说她准备好了要放弃她的身份地位，反而是布兰威尔建议再耐心等等。”这话只能是布兰威尔说的，但这无论如何又都是不可能的，因此我们只能说这是一个既愚蠢又自大的年轻人的臆想。突然间他接到一封信，说罗宾逊先生死了。“他简直是一路在跳舞，好像疯了一样，从教堂墓地的这头跳到那头。他太喜欢那个女人了。”有人如此告诉艾米莉的传记作者玛丽·罗宾逊。

“第二天早上他起了床，精心穿好了衣服，准备出发。但他还没出哈沃斯，两个男人就骑着马火速向村子赶来了。他们要见布兰威尔，等到布兰威尔无比激动地赶来时，其中一人下了马，和他一起进了黑牛旅馆。”这人带来了那位寡妇的消息，求他不要再接近她，因为哪怕她再见他一次，她都会失去她的财产以及她对孩子的监护权。这又是他说的，但是由于这封信从未示人，后来还发现罗宾逊先生的遗嘱里并没有这样的规定，因此无从判断他是否说了实话。唯一确定的事实是，罗宾逊太太让他知道她不想再和他来往了，她可能编了这个借口，好使这次的打击对他来说不那么屈辱。勃朗特家很肯定她就是布兰威尔的情人，并把他后来的行为归咎于她的恶劣影响。她可能确实是布兰威尔的情人，但也有可能他夸口的征服根本就没发生过，就像他之前和之后的很多男人那样只是胡夸海口。如果她确实曾经短暂地被他迷住过，我们也没有理由假设她曾想过和他结婚。他继续拼命滥饮。一位曾在他死前照顾他的人对盖斯凯尔夫人说，当他知道自己末日将临时，他想站着死，他坚持要从床上起来。此前他只在床上躺了一天。夏洛特非常难过，她被带离了现场，但是他父亲、安妮和艾米莉留在他身旁，看他站起来。挣扎了二十分钟后，他死了，正如他希望的那样，他是站着死的。

他死后的那个星期天以后，艾米莉就再没有出过门。她感冒了，还咳嗽。病越来越重。夏洛特写信告诉艾伦·纽西说：“我担心她胸疼，有时她做什么动作做得快的时候，还能听到她喘不上气来的声音。她看起来非常非常瘦又苍白。她缄默的性情使我内心非常不安。问她问题没有用，什么回答也得不到。让她吃药更没用，她从来不吃药。”一两个星期后，夏洛特给另一个朋友写信说：“今晚我真希望艾米莉好点了，但是很难确定。她生病时是个真正的坚忍苦修者。她既不求人同情，也绝不接受别人的同情。问她问题，给她帮助，只能让她恼怒。她在痛苦或疾病面前绝不屈服，直到被迫屈服。对于她平常做的家务活，她一项也不愿放弃。你不得不在旁边看着她做不适合的事，还一个字都不敢说……”一天早上，艾米莉像往常一样起来，穿好衣服，开始缝纫。她喘不上气来，眼神呆滞，但是还是继续缝。情况越来越糟。她本来一直都拒绝看医生，但是最后到了中午的时候，她要人去请医生。但是太晚了，下午两点她死了。

夏洛特正在写另一部小说《谢莉》，但是为了照顾安妮，她暂停了写作。安妮得了一种当时叫作奔马痨的病，布兰威尔和艾米莉也都死于这种病。艾米莉死后仅仅五个月，安妮这个温柔的人也死了。《谢莉》直到安妮死后才完成。一八四九年和一八五〇年，夏洛特去了伦敦，在那里颇受重视。她被介绍给萨克雷，乔治·里士满还给她画了像。史密斯父子公司一个名叫詹姆斯·泰勒的人向她求婚，她把此人描述为“严苛粗鲁”的样子。在那之前，已经有两个牧师向她求过婚，都被她拒绝了。还有两三个助理牧师，有她父亲手下的，也有附近牧师手下的，都对她表现出了特别的兴趣。但是她的妹妹艾米莉打消了那些追求者的念头，姐妹们都管她叫“少校”，因为她知道如何有效地对付追求者们。再加上她父亲也不赞成，因此这些追求都没什么结果。但她最终还是嫁给了她父亲的一个助理牧师，此人名叫亚瑟·尼克斯，是一八四四年来的哈沃斯。那年夏洛特给艾伦·纽西写信说起这个人：“我实在发现不了你在他身上发现的那些有趣的善的萌芽，思想狭隘是他一直以来给我留下的主要印象。”两三年后，她把他也归入她所轻蔑的那些助理牧师中。“他们把我看成老姑娘，我却把他们中的每一个人和所有人都看成极其无趣、狭隘、毫无吸引力、更为粗糙的男性性别的样本。”尼克斯是爱尔兰人，他放假回爱尔兰时，夏洛特和她那位经常通信的朋友说：“尼克斯先生还没回来。我很抱歉地说，很多教民都表达了一个愿望，希望他不要再麻烦他自己跨过海峡回来了。”

一八五二年夏洛特给艾伦·纽西写了一封长信，还附了尼克斯的一个便条，她说这个便条“给我心里留下了深深的忧虑……”“爸爸看到或猜到的东西我不会去问，虽然我可以想。他已经生气地注意到了尼克斯所有情绪上低沉的状态，所有要离开出国的威胁，所有健康受损的症状。但他对此几乎毫无同情，只有很多间接的讽刺。周一晚上尼克斯先生在这里喝茶。我虽没有清楚看到，但也模糊感到——就像这段时间以来我虽没看到但都感到的那样——他总那样看是什么意思，他那种狂热的克制又是什么意思。茶点后我像往常一样回到了起居室。尼克斯先生也像往常一样和爸爸坐到八九点钟，然后我听到他打开客厅的门，像是要走。我期待听到前门碰撞的声音，可他在走廊停下，敲了我的房门，电光石火间，我突然意识到他想进来。他进来了，站在我面前。他说了什么话你可以猜得到，但他的样子你不会想到，我也不会忘掉。他从头到脚都在发抖，脸色像死人一样惨白，说话声音很低，热情但是并不顺畅，他使我第一次感到，一个人求爱时如果怀疑得不到回应会是什么样。

“一个人平时像雕像一样，如今却在颤抖、晃动、无能为力，这副样子真的给了我一种奇怪的震撼之感。他告诉我这几个月来他承受了怎样的痛苦，他现在再也承受不了这样的痛苦了，他渴望我能给他一点希望。我只能请他暂时离开，答应第二天一早给他一个答复。我问他是否跟爸爸谈过了。他说他不敢。我想我是半领半推地把他弄出了房间。他走了以后我立刻去找爸爸，告诉他发生的事。接下来，是与这一场合不符的激动和恼怒。如果我爱尼克斯，听到爸爸这样说他，我会受不了。我的血像是沸腾了一般，被一种不公正感烧开了。但是爸爸把自己气到了一种令人无法小视的状态，他太阳穴上的血管像绳索一般凸起，眼睛也突然充血了。我赶快答应说，明早一定给尼克斯一个果断的回绝。”

在三天后的另外一封信中，夏洛特写道：“你问爸爸如何在尼克斯面前自贬尊严。我真希望你在这里看到处于当前情绪下爸爸的样子，那你就会知道了。他对尼克斯的态度就是一种无法转圜的强硬，一种无法压制的轻蔑。他们俩还未面谈过，一切全靠写信。而我必须说，周三爸爸给尼克斯写了一封非常严厉的信。”她还说她父亲“过分夸大了尼克斯的缺钱，他说和尼克斯结婚将是自贬身价，等于抛弃自己。如果我真结婚，他期待我会嫁给一个非常不一样的人”。事实上，勃朗特先生此时的举动就像多年前他对玛丽·博德一样坏。他和尼克斯的关系紧张起来，后者辞去了助理牧师之职。但是继任者们并没能让他满意，最终受不了他抱怨的夏洛特告诉他这事只能怨他自己。他只有让她嫁给尼克斯，一切才能好起来。爸爸继续“非常非常敌意，无比不公平”，但是女儿还是和尼克斯通了信，见了面。他们订了婚，并于一八五四年结了婚。那年她三十八岁，九个月后即死于难产。

于是帕特里克·勃朗特牧师埋葬了妻子、姨姐和六个孩子，一个人在他喜欢的孤独中吃饭，在他日渐衰弱的体力许可下，在沼泽上能走多远就走多远地散步，读报，布道，临睡前给钟上发条。有一张他老年的照片。照片中的他身穿黑西装，系一条很宽的白领巾，白发剪得很短，额头长得不错，鼻子大而直，嘴唇紧闭，镜片后是一双怒气冲冲的眼睛。他最后死在了哈沃斯，享年八十四岁。

我的本意是想写艾米莉和《呼啸山庄》，却说了这么多她父亲、哥哥和姐姐夏洛特的事，比她本人说的都多，我自有我的用意。因为在写她家的书里，写得最多的是他们而不是她，艾米莉和安妮几乎都不出现。安妮是个温柔漂亮的小东西，但是无足轻重，才能也不出众。可艾米莉不一样。她古怪、神秘，像影子一样。她从来不会被人直接看到，她更像是在沼泽池塘中映出的倒影。她为人到底如何，你只好从她唯一的那本小说、她的诗、各处对她间接的提及，以及那些散播的逸事中猜测。她是个孤僻、紧张和让人不安的人，如果你听说她沉溺于放纵的快乐，就像她有时在沼泽地上散步时会表现出的那样，你会感到不安。夏洛特有朋友，安妮有朋友，艾米莉没有。她的性格充满矛盾。她严厉、教条、任性、阴郁、愤怒、偏狭，可同时又虔诚、尽责、勤奋、任劳任怨、耐心，且温柔对待她所爱的人。

玛丽·罗宾逊描述十五岁的艾米莉“个高，臂长，发育成熟，步履轻快。穿上她最好的衣服时显得身材纤细，有种女王般的威严，但是当她懒散地在荒野上漫步，对狗打着口哨，或大步流星地走在高低不平的土地上时，又不羁如男孩。总之，她是个又高又瘦、看起来松松垮垮的女孩。她不丑，但五官不端正，皮肤苍白且粗糙。她的暗色头发自然是美的，后来一些年在脑后松松绾成一个高髻也还不错。但在一八三三年，她留的细密小卷却不好看。她的眼睛很美，呈浅褐色”。她也像父兄姐妹们一样戴眼镜。她的鼻子是鹰钩鼻，富有表情的嘴巴大而突出。她穿衣服并不考虑时尚，羊腿袖早就不流行了她还穿着，一条直筒长裙裹在她瘦长的身躯之上。

她和夏洛特一同去了布鲁塞尔。她讨厌布鲁塞尔。朋友们想对这两个女孩表示友好，就在星期天和节假日请她们来家，但她俩太害羞，去的话对她们而言等于受罪。过了一段时间后，邀请者们得出结论：不请她们是更友好的做法。艾米莉对社交场上的闲聊毫无耐心，大部分闲聊当然都很琐碎，无非是为了表示善意，人们之所以加入其中，是因为这是教养所在。艾米莉自己太害羞，不加入，还恼怒那些加入的人。她的害羞中既因为羞怯也因为傲慢。如果说她真腼腆，可她又穿得那么显眼，真害羞的人一般是没有那种展示癖的。她穿着那些古怪的羊腿袖衣服，可能会让人觉得她在故意显示她对普通人的蔑视，虽然她身处他们当中，舌头却像打了结一样地口不能言。

在学校里，每到休息时间，两姐妹总是一起散步，艾米莉紧靠着她姐姐，一般不说话。如果有人和她们说话，都是夏洛特回答，艾米莉几乎不和人说话。她俩比其他女孩大好几岁，她们不喜欢后者的吵闹、兴致勃勃，以及女孩们在那个年龄自然都有的那股傻劲。埃热先生认为艾米莉聪明，但是太固执，遇到和她愿望、理念不同的事时，毫不讲理。他认为她以自我为中心，苛刻，对夏洛特也太专制，但他承认她身上有种不同寻常的东西。她本应是个男人。他说：“她那坚强傲慢的意志绝不会被反对或困难吓倒，也绝不会屈服，除非是对死亡。”

布兰威尔姨妈死后，艾米莉回到哈沃斯，这对她来说是永远的回归，从此她再也没有离开过。她似乎只有在那里才能活在她的梦想中，而这些梦想既是她生活的慰藉，也是她生活的折磨。

她是全家起床最早的，在老弱的女仆泰比下楼前，她就把家里最辛苦的活儿都干了。她熨衣服，做饭的活也大部分是她干的。她烤面包，而且烤得不错。揉面的时候她会扫一眼面前支起来的书。“那些跟她在厨房一起干活的、活儿多时从村里临时雇来的年轻女孩记得，她身边会放一张纸和一支铅笔。灵感来时，她会暂停手上的熨烫和蒸煮的活儿，匆忙在纸上写下一些想法，然后继续干活。据说，她对这些女孩总是热情友好，有时像个小男孩一样开朗快活。她和善亲切，有点男子气，但她面对陌生人时却非常羞怯。如果肉店或面包店的伙计来到厨房门口，她会像鸟一样飞进门厅或客厅，直到听到他们沉重的鞋钉声从路上远去才出来。”她不喜欢男人，对她父亲的助理牧师们也没有平常该有的礼貌，只除了一个人，那就是威廉·魏特曼牧师。他被形容成一个年轻英俊、口才流利、风趣机智的人，并且“外貌、仪态和品味上有点女气”。勃朗特家都管他叫西莉亚·阿米莉亚小姐。艾米莉和他相处得极好。原因不难知道。梅·辛克莱在其名为“勃朗特三姐妹”的书中常用“阳刚”一词来形容艾米莉。罗默·威尔逊谈到她时也说：“那位孤独的父亲是否在她身上看到了自己？是否感到她是家里除他以外唯一的男性？……她早就知道自己心里住着一个男孩，长大后这个男孩变成了男人。”夏洛特小说中的谢莉据说就是以艾米莉为原型创作的，而谢莉的老家庭教师责备她不该老说自己是个男人，这事有点怪。女孩这么说话是不常见的，大家只能猜测这个习惯来自艾米莉。她性格和行为中那些令她的同代人感到不安的东西，今天很容易解释。同性恋在当时不像现在一样能公开讨论——尽管现在讨论的尺度经常大到令人尴尬——但同性恋在当时是存在的，男女都有，就像自古以来一直都有一样。很有可能艾米莉本人、她的家人、她家人的朋友（因为我刚说了她自己没朋友）都不知道她这么怪的原因到底为何。

盖斯凯尔夫人不喜欢她。有人告诉她艾米莉“从没对任何人表现过关心，她的爱都留给了动物”。她喜欢的动物都是野蛮难驯的那种。有人给过她一只名叫“看守”的牛头犬。关于这只狗，盖斯凯尔夫人讲过一个故事：“‘看守’只要和朋友在一起，就会显示出它天性深处的忠诚。但是如果有人用棍子或鞭子打它，也会激起它凶残的兽性。它会立刻扑上去咬住那人的咽喉，而且咬住不松口，直到你死或者我亡的地步。‘看守’在家的一个毛病是喜欢偷偷上楼，把自己黄褐色的四方身体舒舒服服地伸展在床上，还要盖上白色的精美被单。可是牧师家极爱干净，‘看守’的这个毛病又太讨厌，于是艾米莉在泰比的抗议下，宣布它如果下次再犯，她本人将不顾警告，也不顾这只畜生的凶恶本性，使劲打它，打到它不再犯为止。于是一个秋天的黄昏，泰比半是得意、半是颤抖，同时也无比愤怒地赶来告诉艾米莉，‘看守’现在又躺到了最好的床上，正昏昏欲睡地享受呢。夏洛特看到艾米莉脸色惨白，嘴唇紧闭，但她不敢说话干预。任何人看到艾米莉的眼睛在她苍白的脸上那样冒着火，看到她的嘴唇紧闭，显得非常吓人，都不敢开口。她上了楼，夏洛特和泰比则站在楼下昏暗的走廊里，四周布满了夜幕降临时的暗影。艾米莉拽着极不情愿的‘看守’的脖子下了楼，它的后腿一副坚决抵抗的样子，一边野蛮地低吼着。旁观者想说话而不敢说，生怕分散了艾米莉的注意力，使她扭过头来而疏于防范那头发怒的畜生。下楼后她在一个黑暗的角落里站好，把狗松开。没时间拿棍棒了，因为害怕那畜生对着她的脖子咬上致命的一下，她就在它还来不及将她扑倒时，赤手空拳地痛打那狗凶狠的红眼。用赛马的行话来说，她‘惩罚’了它，把它的眼都打肿了。然后这个半瞎的、被打蒙了的畜生被领回它本来的巢穴，而给它肿了的头做热敷、照顾它的不是别人，正是艾米莉。”

夏洛特写到艾米莉时，说：“她当然是公正无私、充满活力的。可是她如果不像我希望的那样驯顺和能接受不同意见，我也必须记得完美本就不是上帝对人类的安排。”艾米莉的脾气阴晴不定，姐妹们怕她似乎不是一点半点。从夏洛特的信中我们可以猜知，艾米莉令她迷惑，也常令她生气，很明显她也不知该如何看待《呼啸山庄》。她不知道她妹妹写了一部惊人的独创之作，和这本书相比，她自己的那些著作都只能说是平凡的。为此书辩护使她感到勉强。当有人提议将它重新出版时，她承担了编辑工作。“我于是迫使自己从头到尾读了一遍，自我妹妹死后，这是我第一次翻开这本书，”她写道，“它的力量再次使我感到敬佩，可也使我感到压抑。读者几乎不被允许拥有一丝纯粹的乐趣，每一缕阳光都仿佛穿过层层阴沉的乌云才倾注下来，每一页都充斥着如电流般的道德激情，而作者却毫不自知。”还有：“如果读她的手稿，她作品的考察者会被如此无情和不可调和的自然的导向力量所震颤，被如此失落和堕落的人类精神所震颤；如果有人抱怨听到某些生动可怕的场景晚上会睡不着觉，白天会心里不平静，那么艾利斯·贝尔会纳闷这是什么意思，会怀疑那个抱怨的人矫情。如果她还活着，她的头脑将会长成一棵茁壮的树——更高，更直，树冠也更纷披阔大——它成熟的果实也将更甘美，更润泽。但对于这样一个头脑，只有时间和经验能起作用，它不接受其他智者的影响。”我倾向于认为夏洛特从来都没有了解过她妹妹。

《呼啸山庄》是本非凡的书。大体而言，小说反映时代，不仅写法是当时常见的写法，也符合当时的舆论氛围、作者的道德观以及作者所接受或拒斥的偏见。即使天赋没那么高，年轻的大卫·科波菲尔也可能会写出一本像《简·爱》那样的小说来。亚瑟·潘登尼斯(4)也可能会写出一本类似夏洛特·勃朗特的《维莱特》那样的小说来，虽然劳拉的影响无疑会使他回避写像勃朗特书中那样赤裸裸的、给此书以一种哀怨感觉的性场面。但是《呼啸山庄》是个例外。它和当时的小说截然不同。它是一本很坏的小说，也是一本很好的小说。它很丑，又很美。它既可怕、令人痛苦，又强有力、充满热情。有人认为一个牧师的女儿，一个过着单调隔绝的生活，不认识几个人，也没见过世面的牧师的女儿是不可能写出这样的作品的。我却认为这很荒唐。《呼啸山庄》有种狂野的浪漫，那种浪漫主义远离现实主义的耐心观察，醉心于想象力无拘无束的飞翔，而且有时兴致勃勃、有时却又抑郁忧伤，沉溺于恐怖、神秘、激情和暴力之中。艾米莉·勃朗特的性格如此，她的情感又那样激烈和压抑（我们对她的了解提示了我们这一点），《呼啸山庄》正该是她写得出来的那种书。但是从表面看来，这书更像是她那个无赖哥哥布兰威尔写的，确实也有些人相信是布兰威尔写了此书的部分或者全部。其中有一人名叫弗朗西斯·格兰蒂，他说：“帕特里克·勃朗特告诉我《呼啸山庄》有很大一部分是他写的，他姐姐的话也证实了这一点……我们在莱顿顿脚一起散步时，他常用他那病态的天才独有的古怪想象力博我愉悦，现在这想象力又出现在了小说的书页间，我倾向于认为此书的情节是他的创作而非源于其妹。”有一次，布兰威尔的两个朋友，一个叫蒂尔顿，一个叫莱兰，和他约好了要在通往凯格利的一个路边小旅馆见面，他们要在那儿互相朗读各自的诗歌作品。以下是二十年后蒂尔顿写给哈利法克斯《卫报》的话：“我读了《恶魔女王》的第一幕，但是当布兰威尔把手伸进帽子去找的时候——他常把即兴之作放在此处——他以为他放进去的是诗的手稿，没想到错把几页小说放了进去，用他自己的话说，这部小说是他的‘学徒之作’。他为自己引起的失望感到懊丧，正要把那几页小说放进帽子里，我们却诚挚地请他读读这几页文字，因为我们很好奇，想看看他的小说文笔如何。稍加犹豫后，他答应了我们的请求，并在接下来的一小时内彻底吸引了我们的注意，他每读完一页就把这页放到帽子里。故事在一句话中间戛然而止了，但他口头告诉了我们后续的事，包括人物原型的真名叫什么，但是这些人中有些还在世，我就不对公众指出他们是谁了。他说他还没确定此书最终叫什么，也怕永远都遇不到一个有胆量把它推向公众的出版商。布兰威尔读的这个片段及其中的人物（就其发展而言）正是《呼啸山庄》中的情节和人物，正是夏洛特自信地断言属于她妹妹艾米莉的那部作品。”

这或许是谎言，或许是事实。夏洛特蔑视她弟弟，也在基督教博爱精神允许的范围内恨着她弟弟。但是我们都知道，基督教的博爱是从来都容许很多诚实的恨存在的。这样一来，夏洛特这些未经证实的话就不能被接受了。她可能像人类经常做的那样，劝她自己相信了她想要相信的那些事。这个故事很详尽，没有特殊理由却要编造这样的故事是很怪的。怎么解释？没法解释。据说布兰威尔写了前四章，然后又酗酒又吸毒的他放弃了，艾米莉于是接了过去。有一种观点说这四章写得比后来的章节呆板，我认为这个观点站不住脚。假如这四章真的更浮夸，我认为这是因为艾米莉想要证明洛克伍德是个愚蠢自负的傻瓜，她的这种努力还是很成功的。我毫不怀疑是艾米莉，而且是艾米莉一个人，写了《呼啸山庄》。

必须承认此书写得很差。勃朗特姐妹写得都不怎么好。正如她们的家庭教师身份一样，她们的文字风格浮夸卖弄，“文绉绉”（literatise）一词正是因此才发明的。《呼啸山庄》主要由迪恩太太讲述，她是个像泰比一样什么活都干的约克郡女仆。本来谈话的风格会很适合她，但艾米莉却让她用一种与她的身份极不相符的方式来说话。以下是一个典型的表达：“我试着消除有关这一问题的所有焦虑，通过不断的重复来证明：对于信任的背叛（如果值得用这样一个严重的词的话）将会是最后一次。”艾米莉·勃朗特也许察觉到了，迪恩太太说的一些词句是她这样身份的人不可能知道的。为了解释这点，她说迪恩太太在干活的过程中有机会读书，但是即便如此，她话里的那种自命不凡也一样令人震惊。对她来说，“读信”是“览笺”，“送信”是“致函”，“离开房间”是“退出内室”，她管“她干一天活”叫“她日间的职业”，她“肇始”而不是“开始”。不是“喊叫”，而是“喧嚣聒噪”，人们不是“听”而是“闻”。这真悲哀，一个牧师的女儿如此努力地想要写得像个淑女，可也只不过达到了假斯文的效果。但是我们并不期待《呼啸山庄》写得优雅，这书哪怕写得再优雅也不会比现在更好。正如描绘基督下葬的早期弗兰德斯绘画一样，画面上人物憔悴，脸上表情痛苦，姿态僵硬笨拙，似乎给这一场景增添了一种更大的恐怖和一种真实的残酷。但是比起被提香画得很美的同一题材，弗兰德斯绘画却更见沉痛悲惨。所以在《呼啸山庄》风格化的粗糙语言中，有种东西增强了故事里的激烈情感。

《呼啸山庄》的故事结构也很拙劣。这不奇怪，艾米莉以前从未写过小说，她想讲的这个故事又非常复杂，涉及两代人。这个事情不好办，作者需得给两套人物和两套事件赋予一种统一性，必须小心不让其中一套人物遮蔽了另一套人物的光彩。这一点艾米莉并不成功。自从凯瑟琳·恩肖死后，这书就失去了力量，只除了最后几页还算富有想象力。第二代凯瑟琳是个并不令人满意的角色，艾米莉·勃朗特似乎不知该拿她怎么办才好。很明显，她不能赋予她第一代凯瑟琳的激情与独立，也不能赋予她她父亲那样的愚蠢和软弱。她是个被宠坏了的、没有头脑、任性、没礼貌的小东西。对于她所受的罪，读者不大可能特别同情。她是怎么爱上哈里顿的，过程并不清楚。哈里顿的形象很模糊，除了阴郁英俊，读者对他一无所知。在我看来，写这个故事的作者不得不把很多年间发生的事压缩到读者能接受的一段时间之内，以便读者能一目了然；就像是一个人可以一眼就看清一幅巨大的壁画的全貌一样。我不认为艾米莉·勃朗特曾经深思熟虑过，如何把一种统一性注入一个零散的故事中去，但我猜她一定自问过如何才能使故事连贯，很可能她想到的最好的办法就是让故事中的一个人物对另一个人物讲述这一长串事件。这是个讲故事的便捷方法，而且也不是她发明了这个方法。但这个方法的缺点是无法保持谈话的风格，因为叙述者要讲的事太多，比如描述一下景色等，没有哪个神志正常的人会这么谈话。而且，如果有叙述者（迪恩太太），就必须得有听众（洛克伍德）。一个有经验的小说家确实有可能会找到一种更好的方法写《呼啸山庄》，但是即使艾米莉·勃朗特真的用了一种更好的方法讲述这个故事，我也不认为那是因为她利用了别人的创作。

但是除此以外，我想艾米莉之所以采用这种叙述方法大概也算意料之中。想想她的性格吧，那么极端、病态、害羞和寡言。不这么写还能怎么写呢？写《呼啸山庄》必须要像写《米德尔马契》和《包法利夫人》一样采用全知视角。假如她把这个肆无忌惮的故事讲成她自己的创作，那会撼动她那格格不入、不妥协的高尚品德。此外，她还要不可避免地讲讲希斯克厉夫在离开呼啸山庄后的那几年都干了些什么，怎么受的教育，怎么赚了那么多钱。她讲不了，因为她不知道。她要求读者接受的那些事实是很难令读者相信的，而她则满足于说了就好，说完就不管了。另一个办法是让迪恩太太用第一人称把故事讲给艾米莉·勃朗特听，但我怀疑这样做也会使她与读者的接触太亲密，让她本就战栗的敏感个性承受不了。开头她让洛克伍德讲故事，后来又让迪恩太太给洛克伍德讲故事，这样她就可以躲在双重面具的后面。说到面具，勃朗特先生曾给盖斯凯尔夫人讲过一个颇有意思的故事。孩子们小的时候，他为了发现他们在羞怯外表下隐藏的真正本性，就让他们轮流戴上一个旧面具，好让他们在回答他的提问时能够更自在。他问夏洛特世界上最好的书是什么，夏洛特回答说《圣经》。但是当他问艾米莉他应该如何对待她那讨厌的哥哥布兰威尔时，她却说：“和他讲道理，他要是不听，就用鞭子抽他。”

为什么艾米莉在写这部气势恢宏、热情和令人惊骇的书的时候需要把自己藏起来呢？我认为她在这本书里暴露了她内心最深处的本能。她深深望进自己内心那口孤井，她在那里看到不可明言的秘密，但她作为作家的本能却驱使她卸下负担。据说她的想象力曾被她父亲讲的那些他年轻时候爱尔兰发生的奇特故事所激发；也有人说她在布鲁塞尔求学时曾被她读到的霍夫曼(5)的故事所激发，这些故事在她回到哈沃斯的家中后，坐在火炉边的地毯上，一手搂着“看守”的脖子，一边还在继续读着。我愿意相信，她在德国浪漫主义作家的作品中发现了神秘、暴力和恐怖，因此迎合了她那激烈的性格，但是我认为她在自己灵魂的深处找到了希斯克厉夫和凯瑟琳·恩肖。她就是希斯克厉夫，她就是凯瑟琳·恩肖。她把自己放到她书中的两个主人公身上是否奇怪呢？一点都不。我们没有一个人是浑然一体的，我们心里住着不止一个人，而且他们还经常彼此矛盾。小说家的独特之处就在于他可以把那些将他拼合起来的各类人物在个体人物身上生动地表现出来。而小说家的不幸之处在于在他所创造的人物身上总会包含他自身的一部分，不管这些人物对他的故事来说多么重要。这就是为什么《呼啸山庄》中的二代凯瑟琳不能令人满意的原因了。

我认为艾米莉把她自己的全部都注入希斯克厉夫身上。她把她的狂怒，强烈但受挫的性，没有得到满足的爱，她的嫉妒，她对人类的仇恨和蔑视，她的残酷和虐待狂心理都给了他。读者还记得她曾因一点小事就赤手空拳怒打她那条爱犬的故事，而她很可能从未像爱那条狗那样爱过人类。艾伦·纽西还讲了另外一桩怪事。“她喜欢把夏洛特带到夏洛特一个人怎么也不敢去的地方。夏洛特对未知的动物有种致命的恐惧，可艾米莉就喜欢把她带到这种动物的近旁，告诉她自己做了什么，是怎么做的，然后极其开心地嘲笑她姐姐的恐惧。”我认为艾米莉是以希斯克厉夫的男性之爱、兽性之爱，爱着凯瑟琳·恩肖。我认为正如她嘲笑夏洛特的恐惧一样，当她化身为希斯克厉夫，踢打和践踏恩肖(6)，拿他的头去撞石板地时，她是这样开心大笑的。当她化身为希斯克厉夫，扇小凯瑟琳的脸、骂她，她也是这样大笑的。我想当她欺负、辱骂、恐吓她创造出来的人物时，她就感到了一种放松的刺激，因为在现实生活中，她和人相处时总觉得遭受了同样的屈辱。我认为当她作为凯瑟琳时——这就像她多了一重角色——虽然她和希斯克厉夫对抗，鄙视他，知道他就是一头牲口，但她仍然全身心地爱着他，为自己拥有操控他的能力而欣喜。同时，因为施虐者也是受虐者，她也被他的暴力、野蛮和野性未驯的本性所吸引。她认为他俩是同类，他俩确实也是，如果我对他俩都是艾米莉·勃朗特的假设没错的话。“耐莉，我就是希斯克厉夫。”凯瑟琳叫道，“他永远永远在我心里，他并不是作为一种乐趣，他不见得比我对我自己更有趣些，他就是我自身的存在。”

《呼啸山庄》是个爱情故事，它可能是人类写过的最奇怪的爱情故事，其中一个怪异之处是相爱的人们居然能始终保持贞洁。凯瑟琳热烈地爱着希斯克厉夫，就像希斯克厉夫热烈地爱着她一样。而对埃德加·林顿，凯瑟琳感到的只是一种仁慈的、经常还很绝望的容忍。我们纳闷两个爱得如此痴狂的人为何没有私奔，哪怕他们面临的将是贫困。我们纳闷他们为什么没有变成真正的爱人。可能艾米莉所受的家教让她把通奸看成不可饶恕的原罪，也可能是想到两性性行为让她恶心。我相信勃朗特姐妹俩都是性欲强烈之人。夏洛特相貌平平，肤色灰黄，鼻子很大，还有点歪。她没名没钱的时候得到过几次求婚，在她那个时代，男人们希望妻子结婚时能带来嫁妆。不过美貌不是让女人具有吸引力的唯一条件，何况一个女人如果很美还会让人觉得恐惧。你会欣赏，但是不会感动。如果年轻男人爱上夏洛特这个挑剔、爱批评的女人，那只能是因为他们觉得她有性吸引力，也就是说他们隐约感觉到她性欲强烈。她刚嫁给尼克斯时并不爱他，她认为他狭隘、教条、阴郁、毫不聪明。但是婚后从她的通信中却可以得知，她对他的感觉变了。就她的为人而言，这些信实在轻佻。她爱上了他，他的缺点都不重要了。最可能的解释就是她的那些性欲终于得到了满足。没有理由认为艾米莉的性欲没夏洛特强。

一部小说的诞生是桩奇事。据我们目前所知，艾米莉一生只写了一部小说，而一个小说家的第一部小说可能包含心想事成的因素和想象的自传因素。可以认为《呼啸山庄》纯粹是想象的产物。谁知道在那无眠夜晚的漫长守望中，或是夏日里一整天躺在石南花丛中的时候，她曾有过怎样色情的狂想？大家一定注意到了在夏洛特的罗切斯特和艾米莉的希斯克厉夫之间有着怎样家人般的相似。希斯克厉夫可能是个私生子，是罗切斯特家的小儿子和一个爱尔兰下女在利物浦生的。这两个人都黝黑、暴力、面带凶相、暴躁、热烈和神秘。罗切斯特和希斯克厉夫的区别仅仅在于创造了他们，想用他们来满足自己迫切的、受阻的性欲的两姐妹的性情的区别。罗切斯特是一个有着正常本能的女人的梦想，这个女人渴望把自己交付给一个有控制欲的无情男性，而艾米莉则给了希斯克厉夫她自己的阳刚、暴烈和野蛮脾气。姐妹俩创造的这两个粗野、执拗的男人的原型，我猜，是她们的父亲帕特里克·勃朗特牧师。

但是即使真如我所说，艾米莉可能完全是从幻想中创造了《呼啸山庄》，我也并不相信。我会认为，最终产生小说的那些丰饶想法很少如流星般突然从天而降到一个作家的脑子里。绝大多数情况下，这些想法都得自经验，主要是作家个人的情感经验。或者，如果这些经验是由别人告诉作家的，那么这些经验在感情上也必须能吸引人。随后作家的想象力开始如生产般阵痛，人物和事件也逐渐从中生长，直至成品诞生。但是很少有人知道，一个暗示哪怕再小，一件事哪怕看起来再微不足道，也足以擦出火花，点燃作者的创作之火。当你注视一朵仙客来时，当你看到它那心形的叶子包围着好多花，无忧无虑的花瓣带点任性的表情，似乎是随意生长，你会觉得不可思议，因为这样妖娆的美丽、这样艳丽的颜色居然是从一粒比针尖大不了多少的种子里产生的。那么，一粒能催生想象的种子也可以孕育出一本不朽的好书。

在我看来，似乎只有从艾米莉的诗中才能猜测她的感情经历到底是什么，是什么使她写下了《呼啸山庄》，好让她从那残酷的痛苦中寻求解脱。她写了好多诗。她的诗作质量参差不齐：有些平庸，有些感人，有些可爱。她用得最得心应手的韵似乎是赞美诗的韵，就像她周日在哈沃斯教区教堂唱的那些赞美诗一样，但是即使她用韵平庸，也掩盖不住其下强烈的情感。很多诗都出自《冈德尔岛纪事》，那是她和安妮在幼时为了自娱所写的想象中的一个岛的历史，成年后艾米莉还在继续写。之所以如此，可能是因为她觉得这样方便她发泄心中的痛苦。以她秘而不宣的沉默性格，她是不能忍受用别的方式排遣痛苦的。她的其他诗似乎是感情的直接表达。一八四五年，也就是她死前三年，她写了首诗叫《囚徒》。就我们所知，她从未读过任何神秘主义者的作品，可这首诗却描述了一种神秘的体验，要说它没反映个人经历是不可能的。她用的词几乎正是神秘主义者在形容他们在静思中与其神灵结合后返回自我时感到痛苦的情况下所用的那些词：

噢，那抑制多可怕，痛苦多强烈；

当耳朵开始听到，眼睛开始看到；

当脉搏开始跳动，头脑开始再次思考；

当灵魂开始感到肉体，而肉体开始感到锁链。

这些诗句无疑反映了一种体验，一种被深刻感知的体验。为什么有人觉得艾米莉·勃朗特的爱情诗仅仅是文学练习？我认为这些诗清楚地显示出她曾经爱过，曾经被拒绝，曾经深刻地受到伤害。她写这些诗时正值她在哈利法克斯附近的罗山女校教书。那时她十九岁。这可能是她人生中唯一的一次恋爱。也可能正是因此造成的痛苦足以给她在受折磨的情感沃土中埋下了那粒种子，才使她日后写出了那本我们如今都了解了的奇书。但这只不过是猜测。我想不起还有哪本小说把爱的痛苦、狂喜和残酷表现得如此强烈。《呼啸山庄》有很大的缺陷，但是并不要紧，就像倒下的树干、散乱的岩石和吹聚的堆雪虽然会造成阻碍，但却无法阻止阿尔卑斯山的激流从山坡奔腾而下。你无法把《呼啸山庄》与其他书相比，你只能把它与西班牙画家格列柯的伟大画作相比。黑沉沉的乌云下是一片阴暗荒芜的景象，惊雷滚滚，瘦长憔悴的人姿态扭曲，他们似乎为某种非尘世的情感所镇，都屏住了呼吸。一道闪电划过晦暗的天空，为此情此景赋予了一种神秘的恐怖。

吉卜林与其短篇小说


（1953）

我在本文中将只谈鲁德亚德·吉卜林的短篇小说，不谈其诗歌，也不谈其政治观点，除非其政治观点直接影响到了小说。

我既然要编一个吉卜林的短篇小说选集，就必须决定是否只选我最喜爱的那些故事。要是只选我喜欢的，我就会把他几乎所有写印度的小说都选进去了，因为在我看来，这些印度故事是他写得最好的短篇。他写印度人或在印度的英国人时最得心应手，写起来轻松、流畅、手法多样，这给了他的印度故事一种特质，一种他写其他题材的小说时不是总能拥有的特质。甚至他最不起眼的印度故事都很可读。它们会给你一种东方的感觉，那种集市的气息，雨季时的沉闷，大地被太阳炙烤的热度，占领军驻扎的军营里的艰苦生活，以及那些联合治理印度大片疆域的英国军官、公务员以及大批小官员过得如此英国，又如此异于英国的另类生活。

很多年前，在吉卜林最享盛名之时，我有时会遇到一些在印度的英国公务员和大学教授，他们说起他时，简直就是语带轻蔑。这有一部分原因是出于不光彩却也自然而然的嫉妒心。这么一个没有社会地位的无名记者居然获得了世界性的知名度，他们当然感到愤愤不平。他们抗议说他不懂印度。可是他们就懂吗？印度不是一个国家，印度是一片大陆。吉卜林似乎确实只了解印度西北部。就像其他明智的作家一样，他把故事的场景安排在他最熟悉的地区。英印(1)批评家们指责吉卜林不写那些他们认为重要的题目。吉卜林的同情心在穆斯林而非印度教徒身上。他对印度教兴趣不大，可印度教却是影响广大印度民众最深的宗教。穆斯林身上有些品质引起了他的钦佩之情，而他说起印度教徒时则很少语带欣赏，他似乎从未想过他们中也有博学之士、杰出的科学家和能干的哲学家。比如，在他看来，孟加拉人是懦夫、混混和吹牛者，是个一遇紧急情况就惊慌失措、逃避责任的人。这很遗憾，不过吉卜林有权按自己的意愿处理他的题材，就像每个作家都有权这么做一样。

但是我感觉，如果我只在本卷中收录吉卜林的印度小说，将不能使读者公平地见识到吉卜林的多种才能，我于是也选了几个以英国为场景的、广受赞誉的故事。

有关吉卜林的生平细节，我将只叙述那些与他的短篇小说有关的，再多就与我的目的不符了。一八六五年吉卜林出生于孟买，父亲在孟买的一所大学做建筑雕塑系教授。五岁多点的时候，他父母带他和他妹妹回了英国，把他俩寄养在一户人家里。可是照顾他们兄妹的那个女人又蠢又恶，两个孩子的日子过得很悲惨。可怜的小男孩总是受欺负、被打骂。多年后，他母亲又一次回国省亲时发现了孩子们的真实处境，这一发现让她惊怒万分，于是带两个孩子离开了那里。十二岁时，吉卜林被送到西侯村上学。学校叫联合服务学院，当时刚成立不久，主要是给那些以后准备参军的官员子弟提供学费低廉的教育，以便他们将来进入军队。学校里有大约两百个男孩，统一安排住在一排宿舍里。这个学校实际什么样与我无关，我在这里只谈一下吉卜林在名曰“斯托基公司”的小说里描写的它的样子。很难有比这更可憎的学校生活了。除了校长和牧师，所有老师都被写成野蛮残忍、头脑狭隘和不能胜任的德行。男孩们号称是绅士的后代，却无任何合乎身份的天资。吉卜林给故事的三个主人公起名为斯托基(2)、火鸡和甲虫。斯托基是首领，他是吉卜林完美理想的化身，是勇敢仗义、足智多谋、富于冒险、斗志高昂的士兵与绅士。甲虫是吉卜林的自画像。这三人表现幽默的方式是通过异常糟糕的恶作剧。吉卜林兴致勃勃地讲述他们的故事。公平地说，他的故事讲得太好，虽然让你读了直起鸡皮疙瘩，但是你一旦开始读就肯定会读完。如果不是因为在我看来，吉卜林在这个他叫作“公司”的学校待的那四年对他影响至深，以至于他后来的整个写作生涯都未能摆脱其影响，我根本就不会愿意多说关于那个学校的事。吉卜林从未能摆脱他当时形成的那些印象、偏见和心态，也没有迹象表明他愿意摆脱。直到最后他都对四年级男生混战扭打、嘲笑作弄和野蛮的恶作剧兴趣不减，对他们用恶作剧取乐津津乐道。他似乎从未想过那个学校是个三流学校，那群男孩是帮烂仔。事实上，多年后当他重新造访这个学校时，他居然写了篇可爱的文章，对那位厉行纪律的老校长大加称颂，对自己在他当年的照管之下获益良多表达了感激之情。

吉卜林未满十七岁时，他在拉合尔(3)当博物馆馆长的父亲给他在当地找了一份工作——在一份名为“军民报”的英文报纸做助理编辑，于是他离开学校回了印度。这是一八八二年的事。他踏入的那个世界与我们今天生活的世界大不相同。大不列颠正处于巅峰时刻，有张地图用粉红色标示出地球表面的大片土地都在维多利亚女王的统治之下。母国无比富有。英国人是这世界的银行家。英国商会将其产品输送到地球最远的角落，而其产品的质量也被广泛认为高于其他任何国家生产的产品的质量。除了这里或那里偶发的一些小小的惩戒性的远征外，帝国内部到处是一派和平景象。英国军队规模虽小却自信，尽管有马朱巴山的战败(4)，英军仍然相信自己能抵挡得住任何可能与之对抗的军队。英国海军也是世界最强的。英国在运动方面同样无人能比，英国人玩的运动项目没人能赢得了。经典马术比赛中，基本没听说过外国马能赢英国马。这种美好局面像是会一直继续下去，没有什么可以将它改变。我们这个岛国的居民信仰上帝，放心相信上帝已经把大英帝国置于了他的特殊保护之下。诚然，爱尔兰人是在自找讨厌。诚然，工厂工人报酬太低，工作过度劳累。但这似乎是国家工业化不可避免的结果，谁也无能为力，那些想要改善工人状况的改革者被认为是些有害的捣蛋者。诚然，农民们住在肮脏简陋的破屋里，挣着少得可怜的工资，但是地主阶级的女施主们对他们心怀善意。她们中很多人都在忙于救助农民的道德福祉事业，在他们生病时会给他们送牛肉汤和小牛蹄肉冻，还给他们的孩子送衣服。人们说这世界总是有穷有富，将来也会一直如此，这事于是就这样算了。

英国人常去欧洲大陆旅游。他们挤满了疗养地、温泉、霍姆堡、埃克斯莱班、巴登巴登。他们冬天去里维埃拉，在戛纳和蒙特卡洛为自己建豪华别墅。一个个大旅馆盖了起来，就为接待他们住宿。他们很有钱，花起来也随便。他们感觉自己是一个单独的种族。他们一到加莱就意识到他们到了“当地人”中间，当然不是像印度人和中国人那样的“当地人”，但是总之是“当地人”。他们单独洗漱，旅游时常自带浴缸，证明自己与众不同。他们健康、好运动、有理智，各方面都高人一等。但他们喜欢在生活习惯和英国人不同的“当地人”中逗留，因为，虽然他们认为法国人轻浮，意大利人懒惰，德国人愚蠢可笑，但是本着天生的善良心地，他们喜欢这些“当地人”，认为这些外国人也喜欢他们。他们从没意识到他们受到的殷勤礼遇，那些鞠躬、微笑和想要取悦他们的想法其实都是因为他们舍得花钱。而在他们背后，这些“当地人”嘲笑他们衣着粗鄙、笨拙愚钝、举止糟糕，嘲笑他们傲慢，嘲笑他们傻得总是被人多收钱，嘲笑他们那种以恩人自居的宽容。只有付出战争的沉重代价才能让他们明白他们错得有多离谱。吉卜林回到拉合尔父母身边时所进入的英印社会，就像他们在不列颠的帝国同胞一样，一丝不少地分享了那种先入为主和沾沾自喜的想法。

吉卜林视力不好，无法参加运动，因此在学校时就有闲暇时间大量阅读和写作。校长似乎被他表现出来的潜力打动了，明智地允许他随意使用自己的藏书。后来吉卜林担任了《军民报》的助理编辑，就开始利用闲暇写一些故事，这些故事后来出版成书，叫“山中寻常事”。对我来说，这些故事的主要趣味在于他生动地描绘了他所打交道的那个世界的模样，那真是一副毁灭性的模样。他笔下没有一个人物对文学、艺术或音乐有任何兴趣。当时有个流行观念，似乎谁要想努力了解印度谁就很可疑。对一个人物，吉卜林曾这样写道：“他对印度人的了解正合适，知道得再多就不好了。”一个专注于工作的人是要被人怀疑的，往好里说这人是个怪人，往坏里说这人就是个讨厌鬼。这种生活空虚无聊，这些人自给自足，想想就让人害怕。他们是什么人？他们是普通的中产阶级，来自普通的英国家庭，是退休的政府公务员、牧师、医生和律师的儿女。他们中，男人头脑空空，参过军或进过大学的等于镀了一层金；而女人们则浅薄、偏狭、故作斯文。她们在无聊的调情中度日，最大乐趣似乎就是从别的女人那里撬走个把男人。大概因为吉卜林写这些故事时恰逢一个假正经的时代，他害怕会惊吓到他的读者，也可能他本就不愿写性，总之这些故事中虽然有很多关于调情的描写，却很少有性交的情节。不管女人们如何鼓励受她们吸引的男人，一到最后关头她们却退缩了。简而言之，她们就是英语里那个带连字符的粗鄙字眼所描述的对象，而法语则会比较文雅地称她们为“妖妇”。

奇怪的是，吉卜林虽然脑子快，善观察，读书多，对这些人的了解只停留在表层。当然，他那时很年轻，《山中寻常事》出版时他才二十二岁。经历了西侯村的野蛮残暴，乍一进入拉合尔博物馆馆长朴实低调的生活圈中时，他自然目眩神迷了。以他毫无经验的眼光看来，这个初相识的世界真是光彩照人，就像小布尔乔亚马塞尔(5)初次得入古尔芒特夫人的高尚圈子时感到的那种目眩神迷一样。但是霍克斯比夫人其实并不像吉卜林想让我们以为的那样机智诙谐。当他让她把一个女人的说话声音比作伦敦地铁驶入伯爵宫站时发出的刹车摩擦声，他就暴露了她沉闷无趣的本质。我们被要求相信她是个上流社会的淑女。可是果真如此的话，她就不会去伯爵宫了，除非是去见个老保姆。而且就算去伯爵宫，她也不该坐地铁，而是该乘双轮马车。

但是《山中寻常事》不只写英印社会，还写了印度生活和士兵生活。只要想想写下这些故事的作者当时才十几岁或二十出头，那么这些故事就表现出了令人震惊的能力。吉卜林说其中最好的故事是他父亲提供的，我想我们可以把这话归为孝心。我觉得作家很少能用得上别人给他的现成故事，就像真实生活中的人被转移到小说中时，很少能保持逼真的感觉一样。作家当然是先从某个地方得来想法，但那些想法不会像穿着甲胄、从父亲的脑袋里蹦出来的雅典娜一样，突然出现在作家的脑海中，立刻就能写。不过有一点确实很奇特：一个小小的暗示，一个模糊的建议，就能赋予作家足够的材料去创作，使他最终建构起一个妥帖的故事来。比如吉卜林后来的一个故事《他祖先的坟墓》。它需要的很可能只是吉卜林在拉合尔认识的某个军官随便说的一句话：“这些当地人真是可笑。有个家伙叫什么什么，他驻扎在北边的比尔人当中。他爷爷曾在那儿管了很多年事，死后埋在那儿。这些呆子不知怎么想的，以为他是老头的化身，以至于他能在这些人中为所欲为。”这就足以把吉卜林那生动的想象力调动起来，写出一篇愉快有趣的故事来。《山中寻常事》质量很不稳定，就像吉卜林的作品一直都时好时坏一样。我想这种情况对于一个短篇小说家而言是不可避免的。写短篇小说是件很容易失去平衡的事，写得好坏并不只取决于作者的构思、表达能力、结构技巧、创作才能与想象，还靠运气。就像在面对一小堆看起来全无区别的米珠时，聪明的日本人会从中随便拿起一个，塞入牡蛎，可是他无法说出它是能长成一颗圆润完美的珍珠呢，还是会变成一个既不美也不值钱的畸形物体。同样，作家对自己的作品并不能作出公平的判断。吉卜林本人对《幽灵人力车》的评价很高。我认为如果他写这个故事的时候能再成熟些，就会知道在对那个男人的行为的辩护上他的理解还是太浅了。如果你先前爱过一个有夫之妇，可是现在不爱了，又爱上了别的女人，想和后者结婚，这种事当然是不幸的，但是这种事确实存在。如果先前那个女人不肯接受现实，要追着你，在路上拦你，眼泪汪汪地骚扰你、求你，最后你开始不耐烦和发脾气，这也并非是不自然的。凯斯—魏兴顿太太是所有小说里最锲而不舍的纠缠者，因为即使她死了，她仍然继续在她的幽灵人力车里骚扰着那个可怜的男人。杰克·潘塞值得我们同情而不是责难。比起那些好写的、似乎可以自己写出来的故事，一个难写的故事，正因为难写，作者才更会予以重新考虑。有时候它根本是个心理错误，作者却没有意识到。有时候他在完成的小说里看到的是他先前在脑子里构思时看到的样子，而不是他已经写下来展示给读者看的样子。不过我们不应该惊讶吉卜林的小说有时很差、很琐碎、不可信，我们反而应该惊讶他的大多数小说都如此优秀。他真的是风格非常多样。

T．S．艾略特先生在他为吉卜林的诗所编的选集的序里似乎暗示，多样性对诗人而言并不是一个值得赞美的品质。我不敢在诗的问题上质疑艾略特先生的看法，但是如果多样性不是诗人的优点，它却绝对是小说家的优点。好的小说家有种特性，一定程度上人人都有这种特性，但小说家更甚，即他不只有一个自我，他是好多自我的奇异组合。或者如果这个说法太荒诞，也可以说小说家的个性中常有好些难以调和的方面。批评家们不明白同一个人怎么能既写了《布鲁格史密斯》，又能写了《退场赞美诗》，于是指责他不真诚。他们这么说才是真的不公正。是吉卜林身体里那个叫甲虫的自我写了《布鲁格史密斯》，而那个叫亚德利—奥德的自我写了《退场赞美诗》。我们大多数人在回顾己身的时候，有时能找到安慰，相信某个只能让我们遗憾的自我——毫无优点的自我——已经消失了。吉卜林的一个奇特之处在于，我们本以为那个叫甲虫的自我会随着吉卜林年龄的增长和阅历的增加而解体，没想到差不多到吉卜林死的那一天，它仍然活力依旧。

儿时在孟买，吉卜林和他的奶妈、仆人说印地语，印地语是他的母语。在自传《关于我自己》一书中，他说当他被带去见父母时，他会把他想说的话从印地语翻译成蹩脚的英语。可以推测，十七岁回印度后他又迅速恢复了印度语言的能力。还是在这本书中，吉卜林无比精彩地讲述了他如何在拉合尔获得写作素材，而且很快他就充分利用了这些素材。作为记者，“我报道大桥和此类工程的开工，这意味着有一两个晚上我要和工程师们待在一起。我报道洪水淹没铁路，这意味着我要和可怜的维修工们在雨中待得更久。我报道乡村节日以及随后爆发的霍乱或天花。我还报道发生在瓦兹尔汗清真寺的社群暴乱。当时，待命的部队耐心躲在木材厂或小巷里，只待命令一下，就冲进去用枪托击打群众的脚。这个号叫、灯火闪耀、沉醉在信条中的城市将被不流血地制服”……经常在晚上，“我会在各种奇怪的地方游荡至天明，比如毫不神秘的小酒馆、赌场和鸦片窝点，也会在路边看木偶戏、地方舞，或者走到瓦兹尔汗清真寺旁的狭窄小道上或者附近的地方，只是为了看看……还有在俱乐部或某个军队食堂喝醉的晚上，在那里，一桌男人已经难受得半疯了，却还有足够的知觉继续喝啤酒、掷骰子，只有啤酒和骰子不会辜负。他们想要纵情享乐，也算享乐到了……我去拉合尔堡的采访让我见识到了那个时代的军人，缅米尔的兵营也让我见识到了，只不过印象不如拉合尔堡深……既然不必考虑立场，我干的这行又要求我这样，我于是可以在四维空间(6)中自由穿梭。我开始理解一个士兵生活中的恐惧，以及那条规定‘罪的代价乃是死’的基督教义使他忍受的那些不必要的折磨。”

我在这本短篇选集中收录的两个故事的主角正是三个士兵：穆尔瓦尼、李尔洛德、奥塞莱斯。这两个故事都极受欢迎。我想，对大多数读者来说，这两个故事的缺点在于它们是用人物独特的方言写成的。作家该在这个方向上走多远不好说。显然，让穆尔瓦尼和奥塞莱斯这样的人像国王学院的教师那样用文雅的语言讲话是荒唐的，但是让他们自始至终说方言也会使叙述显得乏味。最好的办法可能就是用当事人的措辞、语法和词汇，但尽量少地再现其语音的独特之处，以免使读者感到不便。但这不是吉卜林的办法，他从语音上复现了这三个士兵的腔调。谁也挑不出李尔洛德的约克郡腔的毛病，因为吉卜林的父亲是约克郡人，他亲自纠正了李尔洛德的发音。但是批评家们已经说了，穆尔瓦尼的爱尔兰腔和奥塞莱斯的伦敦东区腔都不纯正。吉卜林是个描写高手，叙事精彩，但在我看来，他的对话却不是总能令人信服。他让奥塞莱斯说的某些话是这个人物绝对说不出来的话，就比如奥塞莱斯焉能引用麦考利的《古罗马之歌》？我也不相信一个像丛林男孩的母亲那样教养良好的女人能用“爹爹”这样的儿童用语向他说起他的父亲。有时候，军官们和官员们用的印度词汇太多了，令人难以置信。在我看来，吉卜林笔下的对话只有在他把印度人的谈话翻译成庄严有度的英语时才无可挑剔。读者须谨记，吉卜林儿时和父母说话时，都是不得不把他想说的话从印地语翻译成英语的。这大概是他感觉最自然的语言形式了。

一八八七年，当了五年《军民报》的助理编辑后，吉卜林被派到拉哈尔以南几百英里外的阿拉哈巴德，任职于一份相对更重要的姐妹报——《先锋报》。报纸的所有者想给国内办一份周刊，就让他来当主编。有一整版的版面都给了小说。吉卜林先前写《山中寻常事》时，每篇只限写一千两百字，现在空间够大，他可以写到五千字了。于是他写了“士兵故事、印度故事和女性故事”，其中就有那两篇有影响力又令人毛骨悚然的《兽斑》和《伊姆莱的归来》。

吉卜林这一阶段的短篇小说由惠勒的公司编成了六册平装的集子，收入“印度铁路丛书”中出版。他用这样挣来的钱和预付给他写游记的钱离开了印度，“取道远东和美国”前往英国。这是一八八九年。他已经在印度待了七年。他的小说也已在英国打响，而此时他仍然非常年轻。到达伦敦后，他发现不管他写什么，编辑们都会热切地接受。他在泰晤士河畔的维莱尔斯街住了下来，他在此处写的小说质量最高，他后来的作品虽然常常能达到那种质量，却从未超越它。这些作品包括《在格林豪山上》、《向戴娜·莎德的求爱》、《曾经的那个人》、《未经教会许可的婚姻》和《通道尽头》。新环境似乎使他对印度的回忆更加生动了，这种情况是有可能发生的。当作家生活在他故事发生的环境中，或生活在能启发他创作的人中间时，周围的人和事给他留下的印象太多太强，以至于他的头脑会糊涂起来，会只见森林不见树木。但是离开那里却会把他记忆中多余的细节和微末事件抹去，使他可以俯瞰他的写作题材。于是，多余的材料少了，不会妨碍他了，他就可以给他的小说找到一种形式，最终完成小说。

也就是在这个时候，他写了一个故事，叫《世界上最好的故事》。我觉得这个故事很有趣，因为他在故事中第一次写到了“轮回”。这个主题能吸引他是很自然的，因为印度教对“轮回”的信仰根深蒂固，其深信不疑就像十三世纪基督徒对“基督是童贞女所生以及基督的复活”深信不疑一样。游历过印度的人都会发现，这个信仰不光在没受过教育的人中根深蒂固，在有文化和有阅历的人中也同样如此。你会在谈话中听到、报纸上读到有人说他们记得前世的一些事。吉卜林在这个故事里处理轮回这个主题的方式非常富有想象力。他在一个名为“无线”的不那么著名的故事里又一次回到了这个主题。他在《无线》里充分利用了当时的一个新玩具——一个对那些科学爱好者而言的新玩具。他想让读者相信，他故事里那个得了肺结核、就快要死了的化学家助手有可能会在药物的作用下回想起他的前世来，而他在那一世名叫约翰·济慈。对于任何曾经去过济慈在罗马的那个小房间，曾经俯瞰过通向西班牙广场的那些台阶，也曾看过约瑟夫·塞文为济慈作的画像中那美丽憔悴的面容的人来说，吉卜林的故事真是哀伤无比。看到那个将死的化学家助手，同时还是个恋爱中人，在恍惚中绞尽脑汁地写济慈在《圣艾格尼斯之夜》中写的那些诗句真是刺激。这个故事可爱，讲得也好。

我上文提到过一个迷人的故事《他祖先的坟墓》。它写于《世界上最好的故事》完成六年后，吉卜林又一次在故事中写到了轮回，不过这次他的写法不会让人觉得牵强。因为比尔人，也就是故事发生地的山地居民们，相信故事的主人公，那个年轻的中尉，是他祖父的化身。而那位祖父曾在那些比尔人中生活了很久，直到现在他们还敬重他、回忆他。吉卜林从来没像这次这样成功地创造出一种令人难以定义的特点来，因为找不到更好的词，我们就先称之为“气氛”。

在伦敦的两年是辛苦写作的两年，吉卜林的身体垮了，于是他明智地决定去长途旅行。他再次回到英国时是为了结婚，婚后他带着他的新娘开始了世界之旅。但是因为缺钱，他被迫缩短了旅程，并在妻子家族长期居住的美国的佛蒙特州住了下来。这是一八九二年的夏天，他在佛蒙特断断续续待到一八九六年。这四年间他写了些小说，其中很多小说的质量只有他能达到。也就是在那时他写了《在鲁克》，于是有了莫格利的第一次出场。这是个吉利的灵感，因为后来的两本《丛林之书》就是来自这一灵感，而《丛林之书》是我认为吉卜林伟大、多样的天赋表现得最为淋漓尽致的作品。它们展示了他讲故事的奇妙才能，其中有种微妙的幽默，既浪漫又可信。让动物说话的技巧就像伊索寓言一样古老，甚至更老。我们都知道，拉封丹在运用这一技巧方面既有魅力又很机智，但我认为，要想让读者相信动物说话就像人说话一样自然是个极难的壮举，在完成这个艰巨任务上没人比吉卜林的《丛林之书》更成功了。他还在一篇名为“一个行走的代表”的故事中使用了同一技巧，其中，马能讨论政治，但是这个故事有种明显的说教元素，不算成功。

也正是在这段多产时期，吉卜林写了《丛林男孩》。这个故事深深打动了很多人，虽然它不是我的最爱，但我还是把它收入了这个集子。吉卜林在这个故事里利用了一个概念，这个概念吸引了他之前和之后的小说家们，即两个人会经常做同一个梦。故事的难点在于这个梦必须是个有趣的梦。如果早餐桌上有人坚持要给我们讲他昨晚做的梦，我们会无精打采地听着，在纸上写梦中发生的事也同样容易引起我们的不耐烦。吉卜林以前在《架桥者》中写过梦中发生的事，不过那时篇幅相对少点。我认为他在那篇小说里犯了个错。他要讲的故事很好：一场洪水突然奔流而下，淹了恒河上的一座桥，而这座桥恰好是工人们苦干三年就要竣工的一座桥。两个负责施工的白人心里犹豫，不知道那三座还没完工的桥拱是否能顶得住压力。他们担心如果石船走偏了，桥的梁就会受损。他们已经接到电报说洪水要来了，并且已经带工人苦干了一个晚上，尽他们所能地加固了薄弱之处。所有这一切的叙述都极为有力，细节也极为生动，吉卜林在这方面是个大师。桥顶住了压力，一切都挺好。故事到此就算完了，可吉卜林大概觉得还不够。总工程师芬德雷森因为太焦虑、太忙，什么都没顾上吃，到了第二天晚上他已经累得筋疲力尽，他的印度助手建议他吞点鸦片药丸。随后消息传来，说钢缆船索断了，石船松了。于是芬德雷森和助手跑去岸上，下到一艘石船里，希望能阻止这些石船造成无法弥补的损失。结果他俩都被冲下河，淹得半死，最后冲到了一个岛上。早已筋疲力尽又都吃了鸦片的他们睡着了，做了同一个梦，梦见印度教的神祇们都以动物的形象出现了：格涅沙是头大象，哈努曼是只猴子，最后还有克利须那本尊，然后他们还听见了神们说话。第二天早上两人醒来后获救了。但这个双重的梦是不必要的，而且因为神的对话也是不必要的，因此梦就显得冗长乏味。

在《丛林男孩》中，故事的核心元素一样是不同的人做同样的梦。读者们最应该好好读读这个故事，我希望你们也会和我一样认为吉卜林的这些梦写得很好。这些梦古怪、浪漫、可怕、神秘。如果两个人从童年起就一直做同样的梦，哪怕说不出原因，也理应包含一个极其重大的含义，可最后的结果无非是“男孩遇到了女孩”，难免令人失望。读歌德《浮士德》的第一部也有类似感觉，浮士德就为了看魔鬼在酒窖里玩杂耍和勾引一个卑贱的女仆就出卖了灵魂简直不值得。我很难把《丛林男孩》看成吉卜林最好的故事之一，因为这个故事里的人物实在好得不真实。丛林男孩是一大份产业的继承人。他的父母爱他，教他使枪的护林人宠他，仆人和佃户也都崇拜他。他是神枪手，善骑马，办事勤快，打仗勇敢，手下的士兵也都拥戴他。西北边境一役后，他被授予金十字英勇勋章，成了英军中最年轻的中校。他聪明、清醒、纯洁。他无比完美，好得令人难以置信。虽然我百般挑剔，但我不否认这是个动人的好故事，讲得也不错。不过读这个故事的时候，不能把它看成和真实生活有任何联系，把它看成一个像《睡美人》和《灰姑娘》那样的童话就对了。

正是在那些短期休假中，吉卜林逐渐理解了他在《山中寻常事》中所写的英印社会，但是他当记者时的经历也一定使他清楚地认识到，他在那些小故事里描述的只是英印生活的一个侧面。那样的经历我在前文已经引用了一段，从中可以看出他把那些经历写得有多好。他在执行各项采访任务时的见闻震动了他。我上文提到《架桥者》，它精彩描写了那些薪俸微薄、几乎没有机会得到认可的人，他们奉献青春、力量和健康，尽自己最大的努力把该干的工作干好。而在《征服者威廉》（这小说的名字没起好）中，吉卜林写了两三个相当平凡的普通男人和一个女人——这女人就是小说中的威廉——如何顶着酷暑坚持与饥荒奋战，最后挽救了一群孩子的生命，使他们不至饿死的故事。这是个有关无私和顽强的故事，讲得很冷静。在这两个故事和其他几个故事里，吉卜林写了那些为印度奉献的平凡男女。他们犯了很多错，因为他们是人。其中很多人很蠢，很多人因偏见而顽固，很多人毫无想象力，但他们维护了和平，维持了正义。他们修路，架桥，铺设铁道。他们与饥荒、洪水和疫病抗争。他们救护伤者。如今那些继承了他们职位的人——我不是说那些居高位者，我是说那些职位普通但掌握着许多普通人命运的人——是否还能像前人一样称职胜任呢？还需拭目静观。

《征服者威廉》不光写饥荒，也写爱情。我上文说过，吉卜林会像未驯服的小马驹一样回避写性，他在穆尔瓦尼的故事里偶尔说起过士兵们的情爱。《关于我自己》中也曾愤愤指责当局犯了一个等同犯罪的愚蠢错误，因为当局认为“让集市上的妓女接受检查”是不敬的，“向士兵传授基本的防护措施，以便让他们在与妓女交往时注意”也是不敬的。“官方道德害得我们付出了昂贵的代价，我们的驻印部队每年损失九千个白人，造成他们卧床不起的原因是性病。”但他说这话时关心的不是爱，而是一个正常人想要获得性满足的本能。我只记得吉卜林有两个故事是成功描写了欲望的。一个是《女人之爱》，因此我将它选入本书。这故事内容可怕，可能还很野蛮，但是讲得精彩激烈，结尾也神秘有力，哪怕不解释为何如此结尾。不过批评家们对这个结尾百般挑剔。马蒂斯曾向一名访客展示一幅画作。访客说：“我从未见过这样的女人！”马蒂斯回答：“这不是女人，夫人，这是画。”如果允许画家为达到他想要的效果而对事实进行一定扭曲，那就没有理由不允许小说家也给他自己以同样的自由。让故事有发生的可能性，并非是件一劳永逸的事，要看你能让读者接受到什么程度。吉卜林写的不是官方报告，是小说。如果他想，他有权对小说进行戏剧化的夸张，以达到他想要的效果。如果在现实生活中，他笔下那个贵族出身的士兵对被他诱奸又毁掉的女人说不出吉卜林放到他嘴里的那些话，那也不要紧。故事情节还是可信的，读者也像吉卜林希望的那样受了感动。

另一个吉卜林写了真正的欲望的小说是《未经教会许可的婚姻》。这故事很美很感人。如果有一本选集要我选出吉卜林所有小说中最好的一篇，我会选这篇。吉卜林的其他故事的确更典型，比如《区长》，但在这个故事里，吉卜林达到了小说这一媒介所允许的、小说家都想达到而很难达到的完美。

我写以上文字是想说说《征服者威廉》结尾那个爱情场面。它给了这故事一个美满结局，但却尴尬怪异。两个当事人是相爱的，这点明确无疑，但是他们的爱里没有狂喜，而是相当乏味，已经有了种居家过日子的感觉。他们两位都是明理的好人，如果结了婚，日子会过得不错，但他们的爱情场面像是两个青春期的少男少女。一个十几岁的男生放假回家会这样和他们地方上医生的女儿说话，但是两个办事有效率又刚刚经历了一场痛苦和危险的成年人不会。

如果做一个粗略总结的话，我会说作家在三十五到四十岁之间达到能力的巅峰。不到这会儿他不会明白吉卜林强调为技巧的那种东西，不到这会儿他的作品就会不成熟、把握不准和带有实验性。作家通过从过去的错误中学习，仅仅通过生活这个过程——生活能给他带来阅历和对人性的了解，通过发现自身的局限，知道自己擅长处理什么题材，以及如何才能最好地处理这些题材，最终实现对材料的把握。他有才华，能在接下来的十五年间——幸运的话是二十年间——写出他最好的作品，然后他的才华就消退了。他将失去他盛年时拥有的旺盛的想象力，他已经给了他全部能给的东西。他将继续写作，因为写作是个很好染上又很难中断的习惯，但是他写的东西将会越来越苍白，只能提醒人们他全盛时的荣光。

吉卜林不同，他极其早慧，几乎从一开始就完全具备了那些才能。《山中寻常事》里有些故事太琐碎，他后来可能会觉得不值一写，但是那些故事讲得清楚、生动、感人，写作技巧上无可挑剔。即使有毛病，也是因为作者年轻稚嫩而并非技巧不足。当他才刚二十出头，调到阿拉哈巴德，能有更多篇幅表达自己的时候，他写的那一系列故事就已经绝对可以称得上是大师之作了。及至他初到伦敦，去见《麦克米伦杂志》的编辑，编辑问他多大，他说还有几个月就满二十四岁时，难怪编辑会禁不住大叫“上帝”，那时的他成就已经非常令人震惊了。

可是世间万事皆有代价。世纪末到来时，也就是吉卜林三十五岁时，他已经写出了他最好的作品。我不是说从此他的故事就开始写坏了，他即使想写坏也写不坏。我是说他后来的作品以其自身看虽然不错，但都缺了他早期印度故事里浸润的那种魔力。他只有在想象中重回早期印度生活的场景时才写出了《基姆》，才又重新获得了这种魔力。《基姆》是他的代表作。有一件事最初想来一定很怪，即离开阿拉哈巴德后，除了短期造访他在拉合尔的父母外，吉卜林再没回过印度。毕竟是印度小说给他挣得了巨大的声誉，虽然他自己管这个叫臭名，但是其实是美名。我只能猜他感觉印度给了他所有他能处理的题材。他曾在西印度群岛住过一段时间，之后给我写信，说我应该去那儿看看，因为关于岛上的人有好多故事可写，但是这些故事不是他能写的那种。他一定感到除了他写的那些故事，印度也还有很多故事可写，可是这些故事不是他能写的那种。对他来说，风格早就决定了。

布尔战争来了，吉卜林去了南非。他在印度时对他接触到的那些军官怀着一种幼稚感人又相当荒谬的崇拜。但是这些在马球场、运动会、舞会和野餐时表现得如此洒脱出色的英勇绅士，此时却表现出了一种可怕的无能。因为这次这场仗和他们在印度西北边界上打的那种惩戒性的仗太不一样了。官兵们还是像他知道的那样，一如既往的勇敢，但是军队的指挥不力。他震惊地审视着这场一团糟的倒霉战争。他是否把这看成英帝国伟大根基上的第一条裂缝呢？英帝国是他的骄傲，他的帝国意识让他写诗写文，竭尽所能唤醒同胞。于是他以两个故事——《俘虏》和《他走的那条路》——来攻击当局办事的没效率和军队指挥官的无能。这两个故事都是好故事。如果我没将它们收录到本书中，那是因为它们的宣传意味太浓了，还因为就像所有写时事的小说一样，时间的流逝带走了故事的意义。

我应该提醒读者，我的观点，即吉卜林最好的小说是写印度的小说的观点，绝对不是著名评论家们的观点。他们认为吉卜林在他们所谓的第三阶段里写的小说有种他的印度小说没有的深度、洞察力和同情。在他们看来，吉卜林的最高成就应该是像《强制居住》《战壕里的圣母》《愿望屋》《友好的小溪》那样的小说。《强制居住》是个有魅力的故事，但太无新意。其他三个也足够好，但在我看来也不算非同凡响。写这样的小说无须吉卜林那样的大天才。《不过如此的故事》《普克山的派克》《报答和仙女》是童书，其价值全在给儿童提供了多少乐趣，而这点《不过如此的故事》一定做到了。类似“大象的长鼻子是怎么来的”的故事，孩子们一定是边听边笑。在另外两本书里，派克给小男孩小女孩们讲了很多人物，可以使孩子们对英国历史获得一种浪漫的初级了解。但我不认为这是个巧妙的技巧。故事的构思当然都很好，我最喜欢《在长城上》，其中有个罗马军团的士兵叫帕纳西斯，可是如果能把它直接构思为一个罗马占领不列颠时期发生的故事就更好了。

吉卜林定居英国期间写的唯一一个我无论如何不愿从这个选集中遗漏的小说是《他们》。读这个故事的时候须谨记，吉卜林让故事在其中发生的那个名叫“美丽屋”的乡村大宅，虽然让人想起因为庸俗的承办商追求奇思怪想和矫揉造作的虚饰而得名的“古风茶肆”以及类似的恶俗的名字，却并没有变得惹人讨厌。《他们》是精彩的想象力得到发挥的结果。一八九九年，吉卜林和妻儿去了纽约。在那儿，他和大女儿先是得了感冒，后来发展成肺炎。我们当中年纪够大的人都记得当时电报说吉卜林快死了，这事引发了世界范围的关注。后来他好了，但是女儿却死了。毫无疑问，《他们》是他受丧女之痛的启发而写的。海涅说：“我从我巨大的悲痛中作些小诗。”吉卜林则写了个精致的小故事。有些人觉得这故事意义不明，有些人觉得它太滥情。小说家面临的一个危险是从多情滑到滥情。两者的区别很细微，滥情很可能只是你恰巧不喜欢的多情。吉卜林很会赚人眼泪，但有时在他不是写给孩子而是写孩子的作品里，这些眼泪却很招人讨厌，因为惹人流泪的那些情感太做作了。《他们》没什么意义不明之处，在我看来也毫不滥情。

吉卜林对改变我们文明的那些发明和发现深感兴趣。读者还记得他在《无线》中如何有效利用了无线这一技术。他着迷于机器，而当他迷上一个主题的时候，他就会为之写小说。他花了很大力气搞懂事实。如果他有时犯了错，就像所有作家都会犯错那样，大多数读者也因为不熟悉那些事实而不知道他犯了错。他为了技术细节而沉迷其中，倒不是为了显摆，而是因为乐在其中。他本人固然好争好辩、固执己见，但是作为作家，他却很谦逊，不装腔作势。他像一个欣喜于自己高超而轻松的演奏技巧的音乐会钢琴家一样，他选曲的标准并非曲子本身的音乐价值，而是看曲子是否能给他一个展示他独特天赋的机会。吉卜林在一篇小说里说，他需要时不时打断叙述者，要后者解释他说的那些技术名词。小说的读者却做不到这点，因此到头来还是困惑不解，可是吉卜林颇写了些这样的故事。如果他能不这么一丝不苟，这些小说会好看得多。比如《他们合法的场合》，我猜只有海军军官才能完全明白发生了什么，而且我很乐意相信他们会觉得这故事很好。《零零七》写的是火车。《那艘找到自己的船》写的是一艘航线不定的货船，我想只有火车司机和造船工匠才能读得懂这些故事。《丛林之书》和《马耳他猫》让各式各样的动物开口说话，而且说话的方式让人觉得非常可信。编号为零零七的火车和名为迪姆布拉的船也用了同样的手段。我不觉得这有什么用。我不相信普通读者知道（或者在乎）龙骨翼板是什么，船底长桁、高压气缸或者肋骨框架又是什么。

这些小说展示了吉卜林多面才能的另一面，但我不认为有必要将这类小说收入本书。因为读者的角度经常和作者的角度大不相同，从读者的角度看，小说的目的是娱乐。如此一来，这些小说的价值在我看来就很小了。

我对吉卜林那些写恶作剧、戏弄和醉酒的小说疑虑较多，他是时不时就会写写这类题材的。吉卜林身上有种拉伯雷(7)的气质，而时代的虚伪是要有意避开那种气质的，因此限制了他对恶作剧和醉酒的描写。在《关于我自己》中，他说他有次给他母亲看一篇写女性的小说，可他母亲毁了这篇东西，还写信告诉他说：“你以后切不可如此。”从上下文看，这故事一定写的是通奸。至于是否觉得醉酒好玩，我猜这要看个人癖好。我曾不幸与一群酒鬼同住，在我看来，他们最好时无聊，最坏时恶心，但是有我这种感觉的人明显不多。写酒鬼的故事有着强烈的吸引力，因为有关那个暴饮暴食的无赖布鲁格史密斯和那个烂醉的小军官派克罗夫特的故事非常受读者欢迎。吉卜林觉得这两人很好玩，他为他们写了好几个故事。恶作剧更是直到最近还有着广泛的吸引力。黄金时代的西班牙文学充满了恶作剧，大家都还记得堂吉诃德遭受的那些残酷的恶作剧。维多利亚时期也还觉得恶作剧好玩，从最近新出的一本书里我们得知，哪怕是在最高尚的圈子里，也还是热衷于在恶作剧中找乐子。同样，到底是否觉得恶作剧好玩，取决于各人的秉性。我必须承认，我读吉卜林的这类故事时是会不安的。做出整人之举者的乐不可支让我觉得恼怒，他们不满足于只嘲笑受害者受到的羞辱，他们还会靠到彼此身上，笑得浑身没劲，他们会从椅子上滚下来，尖叫着瘫倒在地，用手抓地毯。甚至还有个故事的叙述者在一家旅馆里订了个房间，为的就是能笑个彻底。只有一个这样的故事让我觉得真的好笑，既然我需要从这类故事中给读者举个例子，那我就把它印到了这本书里，这个故事名叫《有个村子投票赞成地球是方的》。其中的喜剧是丰富的，受害者是该受惩罚的，而那惩罚也是严厉但不残酷的。

迄今为止，我在本文中只是无意地谈到了吉卜林的成功，但他的成功其实是巨大的。自从狄更斯以《匹克威克外传》征服阅读界后就再没有过这样的成功，吉卜林也根本不用苦等成功。早在一八九〇年，亨利·詹姆斯就给史蒂文森(8)写信说吉卜林是“此时的新星”，说他是史蒂文森最大的竞争对手，史蒂文森则给詹姆斯写信说吉卜林“太聪明了，怎么还能活”。他们似乎都被这个詹姆斯称作“年轻怪兽”的人的出现惊到了，他们承认他的才华，但同时又有所保留。“他的早熟和各种天赋让我惊讶，”史蒂文森写道，“可他的多产和仓促又让我警觉……我向来写不出这么放荡的东西，当然也不用为此感到愧疚……我从旁观看，我佩服艳羡，我为自己欣喜。但是为了我们在语言和文学上都有的那种野心的缘故，我又很受伤害……吉卜林当然是有天赋的。仙女教母们在他的洗礼上全都喝醉了：他将如何利用他的天赋呢？”

可是多产在作家身上不是缺点，是优点。所有伟大的作家都多产。当然不是他们的所有作品都有价值，只有平庸之辈才老保持一个水平。伟大作家之所以能时不时写出伟大作品来是因为他们不断在写，吉卜林也不例外。我不认为任何作家能够公正评价同代作家的作品，因为他最喜欢的自然是他自己写的那类作品。让他欣赏自己不具备的那些优点是很难的。詹姆斯和史蒂文森都不是不大方的人，他们承认吉卜林才华非凡，但是以我们对这两位作家的了解，我们可以猜想他们是多么的不安，因为吉卜林的某些作品是那么多愁善感、热情洋溢，而另一些作品又是那么冷酷无情、死气沉沉。

吉卜林当然也有毁谤者。埋头苦干多年却只在文学界勉强占了一席之地的作者们很难容忍这个年轻人——这么一个不知打哪儿冒出来、没有一点社交风度的年轻人居然能赢，明明没付出什么努力，却获得了巨大的成功。正如我们所知道的那样，他们安慰自己，预测说吉卜林既然会像火箭一样蹿起，也会像棍子一样坠落。他们以前也曾这样预测过狄更斯。他们反对吉卜林的理由是说他在小说里写自己写得太多了。但是言归正传，作家们除了写自己还能写什么呢？有时作家会以一种富有欺骗性的坦诚把自己捧给读者，比如斯特恩，或查尔斯·兰姆，这既是他们创作的灵感也是他们创作的支撑。但是不管作家如何想要尽量客观，他写的东西仍然不可避免地彰显他自己的个性。读上十几页的《包法利夫人》，你会情不自禁感受到福楼拜易怒、悲观、病态和以自我为中心的个性。吉卜林的批评家们实在是批评错了，他们不该怨他把自己的性格引入作品中来。他们的真实意思当然是说他们不喜欢吉卜林向他们展现的性格，这是可以理解的。吉卜林的早期作品展现出的特点确实令人讨厌。读者得到的印象是这是个傲慢自夸的年轻人，过分自信，什么都懂。这当然引起了批评者们的敌对，因为这些相当不友善的性格特点显示的是一种自以为高人一等的心理，这样就冒犯了别人的自尊心。

吉卜林被广泛指责为庸俗，巴尔扎克和狄更斯也是如此。我认为这仅仅是因为他们写了生活的某些方面，得罪了那些高雅人士。好在我们现在坚强多了，我们说谁高雅的时候，已经不是在夸他了。但是对吉卜林最荒谬的一个指责是说他的小说都是“奇闻逸事”（anecdote），作出如此指责的批评家们觉得用这个词可以打击到他，他们现在有时也还在这么做。但是如果他们能不怕麻烦查查牛津辞典，就会发现anecdote一词的定义是这样的：“对某一独立事件或单一事件的叙述，因其有趣或惊人而得以被讲述。”而这正是短篇小说的完美定义。圣经中的路得故事、古罗马以弗所妇人的故事、薄伽丘的费德里哥和猎鹰的故事都是奇闻逸事，《羊脂球》、《项链》和《遗产》也都是奇闻逸事。奇闻是小说的骨架，它赋予小说形式与连贯，而作家要做的就是给它以血肉和神经。没有人有义务读小说。如果你不喜欢小说，除非里边有超出故事以外的东西，那也是没办法的事。你可以不喜欢牡蛎，谁也不能因此指责你，但是如果你抱怨牡蛎没有牛排腰子布丁的情感品质就不合理了。挑剔小说只是小说也同样不合理，吉卜林的某些毁谤者就是这么干的。吉卜林很有才华，但他思想并不深刻，实际上我也想不出哪个伟大小说家的思想是深刻的。吉卜林的非凡才华在于会讲并且喜欢讲某种类型的故事，大多数时候他都在很聪明地做他擅长的事。他是个理智的人，如果人家喜欢他的小说，他高兴；如果不喜欢，他也无非耸耸肩算了。

吉卜林另一个被挑错的地方是他不善写人。我认为持这样观点的批评家根本不懂短篇小说里人物塑造的地位。写小说的目的当然可以是为了展示人。福楼拜的《一颗简单的心》和契诃夫的《亲爱的》托尔斯泰就认为很好，虽然纯粹主义者可能会反对，说这些不是短篇小说，而是浓缩的长篇小说。可吉卜林关心的是事件。一篇小说如果关心的是事件，那它对与事件相关的人就无须讲得太多，只要让他们活起来就行了。作家只在他需要的时刻讲到人，人也就不可避免地成了静态的人。如果想展示人的发展，作家需要长篇小说那样的时间和空间才能施展。小说人物中最突出的大概要算于连·索雷尔了，但是司汤达(9)如何能在一篇短篇小说的篇幅内展示这个复杂人物的发展呢？现在，我要说，吉卜林的人物刻画足够扎实，已经达到了他的目的。必须区分“人物”和“个性”(10)。穆尔瓦尼、李尔洛德、奥塞莱斯是“人物”，写他们很容易。而《架桥者》中的芬德雷森和《征服者威廉》中的司各特和威廉则有“个性”，写他们不容易。他们当然是普通人、平常人，但是正是这点给了小说的叙事以意义，吉卜林当然知道这点。丛林男孩的父母不是像吉卜林以为的那样是住在祖产上的有地乡绅，而是一对善良正直的夫妇，来自像阿诺德·班尼特的《五镇》(11)那样的地方，在挣到了一笔足够过舒适生活的钱以后，定居到了乡下。吉卜林虽然写他们的笔触很轻，但他们是鲜活可辨认的人。霍克斯比夫人也不是吉卜林想象的那种时髦、出众的人物，她只是个自我感觉良好的二流小女人，但她绝不是个傀儡，我们都见过她。《区长》中的亚德利—奥德在小说开始后第四页就死了，但吉卜林对他的刻画已经足够，任何人都能按奥布雷《生平小传》(12)的模式写出他的生平事迹来，而且还有可能写得很对。连我自己现在都要快点往下进行了，省得抵制不了诱惑，要在此时此地自己写出一篇来，好证明写人是多么容易。

不久前一个著名作家告诉我他很不喜欢吉卜林的风格，到了无法卒读的地步。的确，吉卜林在世时批评家们似乎觉得他突兀、做作、太跳跃。其中一位说：“必须强调：俚语不是力量，滥用句号不等于干脆。”确实是这样。作家用俚语是为了准确再现对话，是为了在叙事过程中给行文一种对话的感觉。反对俚语的主要原因是俚语的时髦是暂时的，几年就过时，甚至会让人不明所以。当然俚语有时也会进入正式语言，获得一种文学的合法性，哪怕是纯粹主义者也不能再反对使用俚语。吉卜林的句子比当时通常的句子都短。这事现在再也不会让我们吃惊了，因为词典编纂者告诉我们，一句话无非就是由一系列词构成，是对一个完整意思的语法表达。一个写作者如果做到了这点，那他就没什么理由不能给句子画上一个句号，他当然有权这样做。批评起同代人来不留情面的乔治·摩尔(13)就很欣赏吉卜林的风格，认为他的文风铿锵有力，有节奏。“别人写得更美，但是我想不起来谁写得更多……他用完整的语言写，他用圣经的语言写，他用街上的语言写。”吉卜林的词汇丰富，他会根据词的感情色彩、精确性、韵律去选词，他的选择经常出人意料。他知道他想说什么，而且说得坚决。他的文字（我在这里只说他的文字）富于节奏和活力。就像每个作家一样，他有他的习性。有些习性他很快抛弃了，比如他对圣经语句的不得体的痴迷；其余的他保留了。他一生爱用关系词开始句子，这很可惜。说“以前”的时候，他爱用诗意的“ere”，而非更自然的“before”，这也很可惜。他还至少一次把even写成了e’en。这都是些小错。吉卜林打造了一种个人专属的风格，我想今天哪怕还有人做得到，也不会再有人这么做了。但是我看不出有谁能否认吉卜林构建的这个方法非常适合他。他很少沉溺于冗长的描述，但他凭借他犀利、敏锐的观察力，他用他所构建的这种叙述方法，把拥挤但丰富多彩的印度生活极其生动地呈现到了读者面前。

如果我在本文中毫不犹豫地指出了我所认为的吉卜林的缺点，我希望我也清楚表明了他的优点是多么显著。短篇小说不是英国人整体擅长的小说形式，英国人的长篇小说也已表明了英国人爱发散的特点。他们从来对形式都没什么兴趣，简洁也违背他们的天性。但是短篇小说要求形式，发散对短篇小说而言是致命的。短篇小说靠建构，不允许还有问题未了。所有这些特点在吉卜林最好的短篇小说里都具备，这对我们来说真是幸运。鲁德亚德·吉卜林是我国唯一堪与莫泊桑和契诃夫媲美的短篇小说家，他是我们最伟大的写故事的人。我不信未来有谁能与他匹敌，我还肯定他将永远不会被超越。

《毛姆短篇小说全集卷一：东方与西方》自序


（1921—1952）

本卷包括三十篇短篇小说，长度相似，程度也相似。第一篇写于一九一九年，最后一篇写于一九三一年。我虽然在很年轻的时候写过一些短篇小说，但后来有很长一段时间，大约至少十二到十五年吧，都在写戏剧，不再写短篇了。但是南海之行意外给我提供了一些主题，那些主题似乎很适合短篇小说这种形式，于是那时，作为一名已经四十开外的新人，我就写了现在叫作“雨”的这篇故事。这篇故事引发了一些骚动，因此且容我把当时的工作笔记抄录在此，《雨》的写作就建立在这些笔记的基础之上，相信本篇序言的读者会有耐心一观。这些笔记是用老掉牙的草率语言写成的，毫不优美，因为上天并未赋予我那种幸运的天赋，即本能地发现那个完美的词来表现一个对象，并找到那个不同寻常却又恰如其分的形容词来描述它。记得当时我正从火奴鲁鲁(1)去帕果帕果(2)。途中我像往常一样，把对那些吸引我注意的同行旅客的印象记了下来，希望将来某个时刻或许会对我有用。以下是我描述汤普森小姐的话：“丰满，有种粗糙的漂亮，大约不过二十七岁。她穿条白裙，戴顶大白帽，脚穿白色长靴，包裹在棉袜里的小腿肚鼓了出来。”我们开船前，火奴鲁鲁的红灯区刚发生了场搜捕，船上的流言说她出来旅行就是为了躲避搜捕。我的笔记继续写道：“W．传教士。是个瘦高男子，有着松松地连到一起的长长的四肢，两腮下陷，颧骨很高，大黑眼睛深陷在眼窝里，嘴唇饱满而感性，头发留得相当长。他有种尸体般惨白的模样，表情让人想起压抑的火。他的手大，手指长，形状不错。他原本浅白的皮肤被热带的阳光烤晒得很黑。W．太太，他妻子。个矮，头发梳得精致，新英格兰人。金边夹鼻眼镜后是不算突出的蓝眼。她的脸长如绵羊，但不会给人愚蠢的感觉，相反，令人感觉她极为警醒。她的行动迅捷如鸟。她最引人注意之处是声音，高亢、尖厉刺耳、没有抑扬变化，落在耳朵里有种生硬的单调，把人的神经刺激得难受，好似一把风钻永不停歇的噪音一般。她全身穿黑，脖子上戴根金链，吊个小十字架。”她告诉我W．是个派到吉尔伯特(3)去的传教士，因其教区所辖岛屿之间相隔很远，他只得经常乘独木舟往返。丈夫不在时她会留在总部处理传教工作。海上经常波涛汹涌，丈夫往返于海上不是没有危险。他是个医生兼传教士。她谈到当地人的堕落时，声音里有种激烈的、故作虔诚的畏惧，什么也无法让她停下来，她告诉我当地人的结婚风俗无比下流、难以形容。她说他们刚来的时候，每个村子里都找不出一个好女孩。她还痛骂跳舞。我和这对传教士夫妇只说过一次话，和汤普森小姐一次话都没说过。以下是小说所据的笔记：“一次搜捕后，一个妓女逃离了火奴鲁鲁，来到了帕果帕果。同时在帕果帕果登陆的还有一个传教士和他的妻子，以及叙述者。所有人都因一场麻疹的突然爆发而不得不滞留在此。传教士发现了她的职业，开始迫害她。他让她难过、愧疚、忏悔，他对她毫不怜悯。他还让总督下令，命她回到火奴鲁鲁。一天早上，他被发现亲手割断了自己的喉管，而她则又一次容光焕发、泰然自若起来。她看着男人们，鄙夷地说：‘肮脏的猪。’”

曾有一位聪明的批评家，他阅读广泛，感觉敏锐，对人情世故也很了解，这在批评家里是很少见的，他在我的小说里发现了莫泊桑的影响。这不奇怪。在我小的时候，莫泊桑被认为是法国最杰出的短篇小说家，我简直是狂热地爱读莫泊桑的作品。从十五岁起，我每次去巴黎都会把大部分的下午时光消磨在奥德翁剧院的走廊上看书，那是我人生中对一件事最为入迷的时光。穿长工作服的店员不管四处闲看的顾客，你可以在那儿看上几个小时书都不被打扰。有一个书架摆满了莫泊桑的书，但是每本要卖三个半法郎，这个价格不是我能负担得起的，因此我只能站着看，往没剪开的书页里看。有时候趁店员不注意的时候，我会匆忙剪开一页，好看得方便些。幸运的是，有些书是廉价版，只卖七十五生丁一本，大多数情况下我走的时候都会买走一本。我就是用这个方法在十八岁前看了所有的好小说。因此当我在那个年纪开始写小说的时候，就会不由自主地选择那些短篇中的杰作作为我的榜样。当然，我也可能不幸选到不如莫泊桑的榜样。

如今莫泊桑的声誉已不比当年，其作品也明显有可予拒斥之处。他是个属于他那个时代的法国人，强烈地反对浪漫派，那时的浪漫派行将在奥克塔夫·弗耶（阿诺德很推崇此人）甜腻腻的感伤和乔治·桑的偏激狂热中终结。莫泊桑是个自然主义者，他不惜一切代价地追求真相，但他求得的真相在我们今天看来未免有点肤浅。他不分析人物，对人物的动机也几乎不感兴趣。他的人物只是行动着，但他不研究他们为何行动。他说：“对我而言，长篇和短篇小说中的心理学，就是通过人物的生活反映他的内心。”这话不错，这是我们都在努力去做的，但是动作本身并不总能表明动机。结果对莫泊桑来说就是人物太简化，这在短篇小说中还算有效，但回想起来却令你无法信服，你会说人比这要复杂。还有一点，就是莫泊桑有个执念，这是个无聊的念头，但是当时的法国人都有这么个念头，即一个男人对自己负有一项义务，他必须和他遇见的每个四十岁以下的女人上床。于是莫泊桑的人物为了满足自尊而放纵性欲。他们就像那些只是因为贵而不是因为饿而吃鱼子酱的人一样。贪欲似乎是唯一强烈影响了他的人物的人类情感。莫泊桑明白这一点，他对此充满恐惧，不过私下里仍对此心怀认同。他稍有些平庸。即便如此，否认莫泊桑的卓越也是愚蠢的。一个作家有权以其最好的作品被人评判。没有哪个作家是完美的，你必须接受其缺点，缺点经常是优点的必要补充。这话应该心怀感激地对那些愿意这么做的后世人说。他们会选取一个作家好的一面而不困于他坏的一面。有时甚至到了过分的地步，非要把明显的缺点说成具有深刻含义，令老实的读者困惑不解。因此你会发现批评家们（也就是后世那令人敬畏的声音）为了给自己贴金，会找出一些微妙的理由解释莎剧中的某些东西，实际上任何剧作家都知道，造成那些问题的原因无非就是仓促、漠视和任性，除此之外别无他解。莫泊桑的小说是好小说，除叙述方式外，故事内容也有趣，即使是在晚餐桌上讲起来也会引人注意，这在我看来绝对是个很大的优点。哪怕你用词再吞吐，表述再无趣，只要你讲的是《羊脂球》、《遗产》或《项链》的故事框架，都一定能调动听你讲故事的人的兴趣。这些故事有开头、中间、结尾，它们并非沿着一条不确定的线索逡巡，以至于让你看不清楚走向，而是毫不犹豫地从展开到高潮画出一条明显有力的弧线。它们可能没有什么伟大的精神内涵，而莫泊桑也志不在此。他认为自己只是个普通人。而且从来没有一个好作家像他那样不把自己当个文人。他不假装自己是个哲学家，他这么做很明智，因为即便当他沉浸于思考时，他的思考也都太普通。他有自己的局限，但仍令人钦佩。他在创造活灵活现的人物方面有着令人震惊的才能。不管篇幅多短，即使在几页纸之内，他也能在你面前树立起半打观察得无比细致、描述得无比生动的人物，让你觉得关于这些人物你已经了解了你所需知道的一切。这些人物轮廓清晰，各具特色，辨识度极高，他们呼吸着生命的气息。他们都不复杂，也奇怪地缺乏我们在人身上发现的那些犹豫不决、意想不到和神秘莫测，实际上为了小说的需要他们被简化了。但他们并非有意被简化，莫泊桑敏锐的双眼看得清楚，但看得不深。很幸运的是他的双眼能看到足以使他达到他想要达到的目标的一切。他对环境的处理是相同的，他的场景设置总是一样准确、简短和有效。他描述的不论是诺曼底的迷人风景，还是八十年代沉闷拥挤的客厅，目的都只有一个，那就是推进故事的发展。在他自己的方法这个层面上，我不认为有谁能超越他。如果现下他的卓越并不明显，那是因为他所写的故事必须和非常不同、更加微妙也更加动人的契诃夫的作品放在一起比较。

契诃夫的短篇小说是年轻作家理所当然应该模仿的榜样，这很好理解。表面看来，写契诃夫型的短篇小说比写莫泊桑型的短篇小说容易。先不论作家讲故事的能力如何，能编造一个本身就有趣的故事已是难事，做到这点要靠天赋，不是靠后天的思考，而且这种天赋很少有人具备。契诃夫有很多天赋，唯独没有这条。如果你想讲他讲的那种类型的故事，你会发现没得可讲。去掉枝节后，他的故事主干是毫无意义、愚蠢空洞的。那些想写故事又想不出情节的人，要是觉得没有情节也能写得出故事，那就太伟大了。如果你能弄出两三个人物来，描述描述他们的相互关系，就这样算了，然后说写小说也不难嘛；如果你能自信地说这就是艺术，那还有什么比这更容易的艺术？

但是我不敢肯定一个作家把技巧建立在缺点的基础上是否明智。我几乎不怀疑假如契诃夫想得到新颖、独创、惊人的情节，他是能写得出这样的小说的，但这不是他的本性。就像所有的好作家一样，他把自己的缺点变成了优点。歌德不是说艺术家只有在认识了自己的缺点之后才能取得巨大的成就吗？如果短篇小说只是散文的一种，涉及的只是或多或少虚构的人物，那就没人比契诃夫写得更好了。但是如果有人认为短篇小说应该是在有限的篇幅内对一连串完整行动的再现，那契诃夫就还有不足。他用以下的话足够清楚地表明了他的看法：“为什么要写一个人为了与世界达成妥协而坐上潜水艇去北极，而此时他心爱的人歇斯底里地尖叫着从钟楼上纵身跃下？这是不对的，这在真实生活中不会发生。作家必须写寻常的事：彼得·谢苗诺维奇如何娶了玛丽亚·伊万诺夫娜。如此而已。”可是也没有理由说作家不可以写不寻常的事。确实，每天都有事发生，但这并不代表每天都发生的事就是最重要的。重温自己熟悉生活的乐趣是这类写作的目的，但这是审美乐趣中最低级的一种。没有戏剧性，并不是短篇小说的优点。莫泊桑选取的是普通人，但他追求的是在他们生活的寻常事中表现出戏剧性。他选取有意义的事件，从中提取所有可能的戏剧成分。这种方法就像别的方法一样值得称道，因为它可以使小说更吸引人。可能性并不是唯一的标准，因为可能性会经常发生变化。曾经被广泛接受的一种可能性是，失散多年的孩子能够因为“血缘的呼唤”而认出父母，女人只要穿上男人的衣服就会变成男人。只要你能让你那个时代的读者接受，可能性就都成立。契诃夫哪怕再有原则，如果那些原则不合他的意，他也不会总是死守原则。让我且举一例：《主教》，这是他最美、最动人的短篇小说之一。它极其温柔地描写了死亡的到来，但却没写令主教死亡的原因。相反，一个技巧更高的小说家会把死因作为小说必不可少的一部分。“与小说无关的一切东西都必须被无情抛弃，”契诃夫在给舒金的建议里这样说，“如果第一章里你说墙上挂着一杆枪，那么第二章或第三章就必须开枪。”所以如果主教吃了腐烂的鱼，几天后死于伤寒，那我们就可以假定腐烂的鱼是他死亡的原因。如果真相如此的话，他就不是死于伤寒，而是死于尸碱中毒，症状就应该和描写的不同。但是契诃夫显然不在乎，他已经决定了，他温柔的好主教必须死。而且出于他的个人目的，他想让主教以某种特定的方式死去。我不明白那些说契诃夫的小说如同生活侧面的人到底是怎么想的，也就是说，我不明白他们是否认为契诃夫的小说表现了真实且典型的生活图景。无论现在还是过去，我都不认为契诃夫的小说表现了真实且典型的生活。我认为他的短篇小说非常生动，那是因为他有一种特殊的才能，但是我认为他写的那些短篇小说却带着一种阴郁、倦怠和消极的病态的成见。我不会因此去责备契诃夫的短篇小说。每个作家都有他自己看待世界的方式，每个作家描述的世界也都是他眼中的世界。模仿生活并非艺术的合理目标，它是一门学问，一种训练，艺术家必须时时臣服于此，尤其是当对生活的风格化已经达到了一种放肆的地步、践踏了常识的时候。对契诃夫来说，生活如同打台球，永远不可能红球落袋，也挽救不了一个看似要输的传球，也无法同时击中两球。如果你能神奇地意外击中一球，那你就几乎一定能量体裁衣，量入为出。他悲叹，没出息的人不会成功，懒散的人不会工作，撒谎的人不会说真话，酒鬼们不会清醒，无知的人也不会有文化。我猜正是这种心态使得他的主人公们多少有些面目模糊。他能在两行之间给你勾勒出一个醒目的人物形象，谁要是能在两行之间就在你面前树立起一个鲜活的人物形象，能做的也无非如此了，但他苦心经营的结果却似乎使他失去了对个体的把握。他故事中的男人们都是影子般的存在，有种模糊的向善冲动，但是没有意志力，得过且过，不诚实，喜欢说漂亮话，经常怀抱伟大理想却没有行动力。他故事中的女人们都爱哭、自甘堕落、低能。她们哪怕知道那是罪过，但是只要有男人提出要求，不管这个男人是谁，她们都会与他私通。不是因为她们有热情，甚至都不是因为她们想要，而是因为她们嫌拒绝麻烦。他只有在描述年轻女孩的时候才似乎有一丝温柔的宠溺。“呜呼！尽管即将毁灭，这些小受害者还是会玩耍。”他被她们的魅力、她们笑声中的欢快、她们的天真和活力所打动，但这一切都带不来好的结果。她们不去试图征服幸福，而是被动地屈服于前行路上的第一个障碍。

如果我斗胆作出以上评价，我请读者不要以为我对契诃夫心怀不敬。不，我对他只有极度的崇拜。我再说一遍，没有一个作家是完美无缺的。崇拜他的优点是好，但是不承认他的不完美，还坚持他的不完美也是优点，长此以往会损害他的声誉。契诃夫的作品可读性极强，这是作家最了不起的优点，我们对这点的强调还远远不够。契诃夫的作品和莫泊桑的一样好读。他们都是职业作家，为了谋生，多少会定期制造出小说来。他们写作如同医生看病人或律师见客户，是日常工作的一部分。他们必须取悦读者。他们不是总有灵感，只有偶尔才能写得出杰作，但他们写的东西也甚少有不能吸引读者注意力的。他们既给报纸写也给杂志写。批评家们有时会把一本短篇小说集说成是杂志小说，并因此在心里诅咒。这是愚蠢的。所有的艺术形式都是因为有需求才被创造出来。如果报纸杂志不出短篇小说，就不会有人写短篇小说了。所有的小说都是杂志小说或报纸小说。作家必须接受某些条件，而且那些条件总是在变，但还从来没有一个好作家是因为只有在某一特定条件下才能为其作品赢得公众而写不出他的最好作品来的。这从来都是些二流作家的借口。契诃夫的一大优点之所以是简洁，我怀疑是因为他惯常为之写作的报纸只能给他有限的版面。契诃夫说过，小说既不应该有开头也不应该有结尾。这话不可能是字面意思。这就像你要求鱼既不应该有头也不应该有尾一样，如果没有头和尾鱼就不是鱼了。实际上契诃夫给小说开头的方法好极了，他会在几行之内很快就给出事实。他对核心陈述有着准确的把握，会直截了当地把它们写下来，但他写得极为精确，你立刻就会知道你要打交道的人是谁，事又是怎么回事。莫泊桑经常给小说开头的方法是先介绍情况，为的是把读者置于某种特定的心境之下。这种方法很危险，只有成功了才行得通。它还有可能会沉闷，有可能使读者失去线索。你已经引起了他对某些人物的兴趣，现在却不告诉他这些人后来怎么样了，反而把他的兴趣转移到了其他人、其他事上。契诃夫崇尚简洁，但在较长篇幅的作品中他却并不总能做到这一点。有人指责他对道德和社会问题麻木不仁，他深受其扰，因此在篇幅足够的情况下，他会抓住时机表明这些问题对他而言就像对任何思想健全的人一样重要。然后他会在冗长的、多少有些乏味的对话中，让他的人物表达他本人坚定的信仰：不管当时情况如何，在不久的将来（比如说一九三四年）俄国人将获得自由，暴政将不再存在，穷人将不再挨饿，幸福、和平以及兄弟般的友爱将到处存在于这个广大的帝国之中。他写的这些题外话可能是由于他受舆论的压力所迫，类似舆论在所有国家都普遍存在，它认为小说家应该是先知、社会改革家和哲学家。在他较短的小说里，契诃夫以一种几乎神奇的方式达到了他所立下的简洁的目标。

除他以外，没人能对地方、风景、对话或（在其有限的篇幅之内）人物写出更令你亲切的感觉。我想这就是“气氛”这个模糊的字眼所指代的东西。契诃夫似乎不用复杂的解释和冗长的描述，只用准确的事实叙述就制造出了这种“气氛”。我想这要归功于他用一种惊人的简单去看待事物的能力。俄国人是些半野蛮人，他们好像还保留着看事物的自然眼光，好像还生活在真空中一般。而我们背靠复杂文化的西方人看事物的眼光，则是一种经历了很多个世纪的漫长文明之后所获得的、联系的眼光。俄国人看事物似乎只见其自身。过去几年间，大多数作家，尤其是那些住在海外的作家，都看到了不少俄国流亡者写的小说，他们徒劳地希望把作品发表，不管发表在哪，只要能挣几个基尼(4)就好。那些小说虽然写的是现在的事，写得却很像契诃夫，而且还不是最好的契诃夫。他们都有那种直接的、真诚的视角，那是一种天赋的能力，那种能力在契诃夫身上发展得最为突出。

但是我还没说在我看来契诃夫最大的优点是什么。我不是批评家，不掌握准确的批评语汇，因此我只能用个人感觉尽量对之进行描述。契诃夫有一种用“气氛”围绕人物的惊人能力，因此他的人物虽不立体，缺乏莫泊桑人物那种粗糙、通常还很野蛮的活力，但他们却有种奇异的、非尘世般的生命力。他们不是被寻常一天的坚硬强光所照亮，而是被一团神秘的灰色所浸润笼罩。他们在这团灰色中活动，好似脱离了躯壳的游魂一般。你恍惚看到的是他们的灵魂。潜意识似乎浮出水面，彼此直接交流，不存在言语的障碍。奇怪徒劳的造物啊，对他们的外在描述如同博物馆中的展品说明卡一样钉在他们身上，他们的举止好似但丁在地狱中行走时身边围绕的那些饱受折磨的灵魂一样神秘。你有种感觉，似乎有一大群失落的灰色人影在一个幽暗的地下世界漫无目的地游荡，使你敬畏，令你不安。我已经说过，契诃夫在创造人物的多样性方面没有太大才能。顶着不同名字、出现在不同环境里的其实是同一群人。当你看到灵魂的时候，那些表面的区别就消失了，每个人都多多少少一样了。他的人物奇特地融入彼此，似乎他们不是各不相同的个体，而是临时虚构的，又似乎他们其实全部都只是彼此的一部分。作家的重要性何在？从长远看，在其独特性。除契诃夫外，我不知道哪个作家曾经如此悲哀地再现了精神与精神之间的联系。正是这点使人感到相形之下，莫泊桑是如此平淡、庸俗。令人惊异的是，这两个伟大作家，莫泊桑和契诃夫，虽然看人的方式非常不同，对人的看法却一模一样。他们一个满足于看肉体，另一个更高贵、更微妙地审视精神，但他们都认为生活无聊、无意义，人类可鄙、可怜、无知。

我希望读者不要不耐烦我在自己短篇小说的序言中竟长篇大论地谈起了这两位伟大的作家。因为作为短篇小说家，莫泊桑和契诃夫的影响直达今日，我们所有在这一艺术形式中耕耘的人最终都必须被他们所设定的标准评价。

就我记忆所及，我是按写作顺序排列本卷中的各篇小说的。我想读者可能会对我是如何从最初的试探发展到了后期的相对确定感兴趣。也就是说，开始时我还只好听命于我的故事，后来我学会了如何安排素材，以达到我想要的结果。虽然除两篇以外，所有篇目都曾在杂志上发表过，但我最初写这些故事却不是为了在杂志上发表。我那时在经济上幸运地处于还不错的独立状态，再加上我认为自己忙于工作已经太久，因此我写短篇是为了从工作中获得放松。经常有人说短篇小说不会比现在强到哪去了，因为杂志编辑坚持它们必须以某种模式写。这不是我的经历。除了《雨》和《书包》外，所有故事都曾在《大都会》杂志上发表过。瑞朗编辑从没给过我压力，那使我能按我希望的方式写。有些故事发表时会被截断，不过这是合理的，因为编辑只能给投稿人一定的版面，再多就负担不起了。但我从未被要求为了迎合读者可能的口味而对文字做哪怕是最小的改动。对我的作品，瑞朗不仅给了一个好价钱，还给了真诚的欣赏，我对后者的珍视一点不比对钱少。我们作家是简单而幼稚的动物，买我们产品的人说的每一个赞美之词我们都很珍视。这些故事大多是以当初偶然记下的笔记为素材成组写的，我当然会把每组中最难写的故事留到最后。所谓难写，是因为一开始并没有完全想好，后来只好依赖想象和经历才能把某些部分敷衍出来。有时那条故事发展的弧线没能自然地呈现，你不得不求助于这种或那种方法才能把它画出来。

我请读者不要被一个事实欺骗，即因为这些故事很多都是以第一人称叙述，就以为它们是我个人的经历。第一人称只是一种为了达到逼真而使用的手法。它有缺陷，因为它可能会让读者以为叙述者不可能知道他所讲述的所有事情。当叙述者用第一人称叙述隔了一层的事，也就是说当他讲的是别人告诉他的事，那么此时他——比如是个警察或者船长——就永远不可能灵巧或详细地表达自己的思想感情。每种传统手法都有其缺点。缺点必须被尽可能掩盖，不能掩盖的只好接受。第一人称的优点是直接，可以使作者只讲他知道的东西，不用假装无所不知。如果一个动机或一件事他不知道，他只需老实承认，如此则可以经常赋予他的故事以一种可信性。若不如此，故事就可能缺乏这种可信性。它还可以使读者和作者间建立起亲密的关系来。既然莫泊桑和契诃夫都努力想做到客观，结果却都变成了赤裸裸的个人化，那么有时在我看来，如果作者无论如何都不能把自己从作品中剥离出去，那还不如尽可能地投入其中。这样做的危险是他有可能太过投入其中，以至于变得无聊无趣，就像一个坚持要控制谈话的谈话者一样。就像所有的传统手法一样，这种传统手法也须谨慎运用。诸君可能已经注意到了，在《雨》的原始笔记中，对叙述者是做过介绍的，但在故事中却省略了。

本卷中有三个故事是别人讲给我听的，我除了使它们合理、连贯和富有戏剧性外，并未做任何改动。这三个故事是《信》、《丛林里的脚印》和《书包》。其他故事都是我编的，正如我通过《雨》所展示的那样，是我偶然在各处遇到了一些人，他们自身，或者我听说的有关他们的一些东西，让我想起了一个适合小说的主题。这就涉及了一个问题，这个问题总是与作者有关，有时也会令公众、令作者的创作原型不舒服：有些作家宣称他们创作人物时，脑子里从来都没有一个原型。我认为他们错了。他们之所以这么想，是因为他们没有足够细心地审视他们从中建构出人物的那些回忆和印象，反而天真地以为这些人物是他们独造的。如果他们能仔细审视一下，就会发现除非他们的人物来自他们读过的某本书——这种做法非常常见——否则就是取材于他们认识或见过的一个或几个人。先前的一些伟大作家从不讳言他们的人物是建立在真人的基础之上。我们知道伟大的沃尔特·司各特爵士，这是一个有着最崇高原则的人。开始时他犀利地刻画他父亲，后来当时光流逝改变了他的脾性时，又能宽容待之。亨利·贝尔(5)至少曾在其一本小说的手稿边缘上写过人物原型的名字。而屠格涅夫则说：“就我个人而言，我应该坦承，我在构思人物时，从来不是先有想法，而是先有真人，一个各种元素可以在其身上达成协调统一的真人。我总是需要先有个地基，好使自己可以坚实地立足其上。”福楼拜也是如此，狄更斯更是随意利用亲朋作为创作原型，在这上面他可以说是声名狼藉。再说儒勒·勒纳尔的《日记》(6)吧，对每个想知道作家如何写作的人来说，此书很有启发。读此书时你更会发现关于他所认识的人的习惯、言语和相貌，勒纳尔是多么仔细地记下了每个小细节。日后写小说时，他会利用到这个精心收集的信息库。在契诃夫的日记里，你会发现明显是为将来所用而记的笔记，而在他朋友的回忆中，也经常会提到那些成为他某些人物原型的人。这种做法实为常见，我应该说是必须和不可避免的，其方便之处显而易见。你如果有个真实原型，就会更能创造出一个有个性的可辨识的人物。想象力无法凭空起作用，它需要感官刺激。一个创造力被某人的某个奇特之处激发的作家，哪怕那奇特或许是只有他一人以为的奇特，如果他不按他所见到的原型的模样描绘那人，他的初衷也会被歪曲。人的性格是黏合在一起的，如果你认为人的高矮对其性格没有影响，于是在写作中把矮子变高，或者把平静温和的那个人写得暴躁易怒，以此来糊弄读者，那么借用西班牙作家巴尔塔沙·葛拉西安的妙语，你就破坏了组成人物性格的那种合理的和谐。如果不是因为其中所涉之人的感情，整件事将会一帆风顺。作家必须考虑人类的虚荣本质及其幸灾乐祸的特点，这是人类最常见也最可恨的缺点之一。假如人们在一本书中识别出了自己的朋友的特征，尤其是当这本书对这个朋友的刻画是负面的，那么哪怕作者都没见过这个人的面，这些人也会高兴地向这个人指出他们心目中他的形象如何。还有，一个人经常会在书中识别出他知道自己身上也有的特征，或者识别出对他居住地的描述，于是他会立刻在幻想中得出结论，说那个被描写的人是他自己。且举一例。我在名为“办事处”的那篇小说里写了一个英国驻外代表，这个人身上有我在西班牙认识的一个英国领事的影子，他死后十年我写了这个故事，但我后来听说沙捞越(7)的一个区代表非常生气，因为他以为我写的是他。我虽然在故事里写到了沙捞越这个地方，但这二人其实毫无共通之处。我不认为有任何作家会想要绝对真实地照抄一个人物。把一笔一画从现实生活中勾画的人物放到虚构的小说里，确实没有什么比这更不明智了。他的价值观全错了，而且奇怪的是，除他自己以外，他没有把故事里的其他人物弄成虚假。他无法让别人信服。这就是为什么很多作家虽然被已故诺思克利夫勋爵独特、强大的个性吸引，却没有一个人能成功地把他写成一个令人信服的人物。作家选择的原型需以作家本人的性情视之，如果他是个有独创性的作家，那么他的所见不必与事实有任何关系。他可以把高个看成矮个，也可以把慷慨大方之人看成贪得无厌之徒。但是同时我还得说，如果他把高个看成高个，这个人就必须一直高下去。他从真人身上只取他所需之物。他把他当成挂衣钩，在上边挂上自己的想象。为了达到他的目的，即真实世界中很少出现的那种合理的和谐，他把原型并不具备的特点赋予了人物，他使人物连贯充实。被创造出来的人物是想象作用于事实之上的结果，是艺术，而未经加工的生活，我们都知道，只不过是这艺术的原材料。奇怪的是，只要有人指控说作家从生活中模仿了这个或那个人物，重点就放在了这个人物的那些不那么令人赞美的品质上。比如你说一个人对他妈很好，却打老婆，大家会立刻大叫：啊，这是布朗，打老婆多可恶，却一刻也不会想到对老娘好得出名的琼斯和罗宾逊。从中我可以得出一个多少有些令人惊人的结论，即我们看朋友，只知其缺点，不知其优点。我曾经说过我和《雨》中的汤普森小姐甚至连话都没说过。这是个世人从不会觉得缺乏活力的人物。虽然我只是众多写作者中的一个，但我的实践大多数作家无疑都有过。因此我不妨再举一例。有一次我受邀和一对夫妇吃饭，去之前别人告诉我的关于他们的情况我马上就会告诉诸君。我想我一直都不知道他们的名字，如果在街上遇见了也绝对认不出来。以下是我当时的笔记：“一个大约五十岁、相当自负的胖大男子。戴夹鼻眼镜，灰白头发，面色红润，蓝眼睛，上唇留着整齐的灰胡子。说话时很自信。他在一个边远地区当驻外代表，对自己地位的重要性相当自负。他鄙视那些屈服于气候和环境的人。他利用在东方的短暂假期，曾经广泛游历过，他知道爪哇、菲律宾、中国沿海以及马来半岛。他非常英国化，非常爱国；经常锻炼。过去喝酒很多，上床时总带着一瓶威士忌。现在他太太完全治好了他，除了水他什么都不喝了。她是个不起眼的小个子女人，轮廓分明，瘦，肤色灰黄，平胸。她穿得很差。她有英国女人所有的偏见。她的家族世代都在二流军团。你要是不知道她使她丈夫完全戒了酒，你会认为她相当不起眼、不重要。”我就是从上述材料里创作了名为“晚会之前”的那篇小说。我不认为任何心地坦诚的人会认为这两个人有理由抱怨他们被利用了。确实，如果我没有遇到他们，我就不会想出这么一篇小说来。但是任何不怕麻烦读了这篇故事的人会发现，给了这故事以灵感的带着一瓶酒上床的情节在故事中已经变得多么不重要了，而以上的介绍固然是这两个主人公形成的基础，但在写作过程中，他们也已发展得和这寥寥几笔的介绍大相径庭了。

“批评家像马蝇一样，让马没法耕田，”契诃夫如此说，“我读对我小说的批评已经有二十多年了，但我从来不记得曾读到过一句有价值的话，或一条有价值的建议。只有一次斯卡比切夫斯基说了句话给我留下了印象。他说我会醉死在沟里。”契诃夫写了二十五年，也被攻击了二十五年。我不知道今天的批评家们天性是否不再如此暴烈了，我只能说，整体而言，当此卷中的短篇小说不时被结集出版的时候，它们得到的评价还不错。但是有一个经常被用来描述它们的词却让我百思不得其解，那就是“能干”，它的使用实在频繁到了令我不安的地步。表面上我可能以为这是表扬，因为干一件事“能干”总比“不能干”更值得夸赞。但是这个词用的是贬义，我又是个好学之人，总想尽可能地提升自我，因此我会自问，批评家们用这个词的时候脑子里到底在想什么。当然我们每个人都不会被所有人喜爱，一个人的写作是对他自身的深刻揭示，自然会招致讨厌他的那些人的反感，这是必然的，这不会让他难过。但是如果一个作家的作品被普遍认为具有一种不吸引很多人的特点，那么这个作家就应该注意了。很明显，我的小说有不为一些人所喜的东西，他们用“能干”这个词似褒实贬的正是这个东西。我觉得这就是我小说形式的确定性。我斗胆提出这个看法，尽管这可能对我而言太过褒奖了，但我的理由是“能干”这一说辞从未在法国被人提出过，而在法国，我的小说在批评家和公众那里获得的成功全部都超过英国。法国人的古典感觉和他们条理清晰的头脑要求小说形式必须严格精确，线索不能散落得到处都是，主题提出来了不能不解决，高潮预见到了不能又避开，否则会让他们恼怒。而在另一方面，这种严格精确在英国人看来却总有些讨厌。我们的伟大小说都是没有形状的，但这不仅不令英国读者不安，还给了他们一种安全感。他们觉得这就是我们知道的生活：恣意、不合逻辑，能把二加二等于四这种令人恼火的想法抛诸脑后。如果我的这个猜测正确，那我真是无能为力，余生只能满足于被人称为“能干”了。我在艺术上的偏向是在法则和秩序一方。我喜欢“合身”的短篇小说。我是直到有很多写戏剧的经验之后才开始严肃地写短篇小说的，而这些经验教会我把短篇小说中没有戏剧价值的东西全部删掉。它教会我事件要接连发生，以便达到我想要的那种高潮。我不是不知道这种方法的缺点。它会产生一种刻板的效果，有时令人不安。你感觉生活的各个部分并非像小说这样全都严丝合缝地吻合在一起。生活中的故事往往胡乱发展，不知从何处开头，也不知在何处结尾，还连个确切的终点都没有。这大约就是契诃夫说的小说不应有开头也不应有结尾的意思吧。当然，有时当你看到人物的行为与其性格完全吻合，事件有条不紊地发生、发生的时机恰在其时，也会给你一种憋闷的感觉。这类小说作者的目的不仅是为了吐露他对人生的感受，还是为了一种形式上的装饰。他为达到自己的目的而建构生活。他遵从自己头脑中的一个设计，一会儿删掉这个，一会儿改变那个。为了于己有利，他按自己的计划歪曲事实。当他达到目的时，他就创造出了一件艺术品。或许生活从他指缝中溜走，然后他就失败了。或许有时候他看起来太假，让你无法相信他，而当你不再相信一个小说家的时候，他就完了。如果他成功了，他会强迫你暂时接受他对宇宙的看法，当你追随他在混沌表面所描绘的那幅图画时，他会给你以乐趣。但他不想证明什么。他画了一张画，并且把这张画放在你面前。你可以拿走，放那儿不要也行。

《毛姆短篇小说全集卷二：满天之下》自序


（1923—1952）

本卷包括了我所有未收入《东方与西方》的短篇小说。它们长度类似，程度类似，收入一卷一起出版正可谓方便至极。此卷小说大多短小。有些是很多年前写的，有些是最近所作。它们曾在杂志上发表，后来也曾出版成书。对第一种我命名为“大都会”，因为它们都曾在《大都会》杂志上发表。若非当时的编辑瑞朗，我根本就不会把这些故事写出来。

一九二〇年我在中国的时候，记录了我所见到的所有能激起我兴趣的事，意图日后能从中拾掇出一段连贯的叙述来，但回家一读，觉得它们自有一种生动，如果硬要详述，反会令它丧失。于是我改了主意，决定原样发表，起名为“在中国屏风上”。不想瑞朗碰巧读到，觉得其中某些笔记可以写成短篇小说。我在本卷中收录了两个这样的短篇：《大班》和《领事》。事实是，如果你是个小说家，那么你遇到的任何奇人怪人都有可能是你写出一篇小说的提示，任何别人眼里的偶然事件都有可能在你这里展示出一种格局来，而你的自然本能将会把这种格局套在这些人事之上。

杂志读者不喜欢读了小说的开头，又读了一会儿小说后，却被告知要翻到一百多少页才能继续读。小说作者也不喜欢这样，因为他们觉得这种打断会干扰读者。除此他们还有种不安的恐惧，怕读者会嫌麻烦不读了。这真是无可奈何。大家都知道杂志的成本高于售价，不靠广告根本生存不了。广告商们以为如果把公告文字和广告内容放在同一页的话，公告会更有可能被读者读到。除此之外，他们还谦虚地，其实是经常错误地，以为广告本身会更有趣一些，因此有插图的那些杂志经常会把一篇小说或文章的开头连同所配的插图放在一页的开头，而把正文和广告放在一起。

读者和作者都不应抱怨。读者付出的费用远比成本低得多，作者挣的也只有广告才能负担得起。作者们应该记住，他们之所以能在杂志上出现其实只是个诱饵。他们的任务就是把广告的空白处填满，间接诱惑读者掏钱买汽车配件、美容用品，或是加入函授课程。幸运的是，这不会影响到他们。从广告商的角度看，最好的短篇小说是那些最能娱乐读者的小说，他们的这种观点众所周知。瑞朗则有这么一种观点，即《大都会》的读者会喜欢读那些不用在广告里找寻其余部分的小说，所以应该至少给读者一个这样的小说，于是他约我写了半打类似《在中国屏风上》的小品文。它们必须足够短小，能印到杂志的对页上，能给插图留下足够空间。

我写的小品文还挺得读者的欢心，于是《大都会》又和我续了约。我一直写到我天生的啰唆打败了我，使我发现我再也无法把字数控制在规定范围内，然后我就不得不停止了。我想我从这段写作中学到了很多，也很高兴我学到了很多。我的困难是我必须把我想说的话压缩到一定字数内，不能超过规定，可同时还要让读者觉得该说的话我都说了。就是这点使得这事既有趣又有利。我一个字都不能浪费，必须简洁。我惊讶地发现原来很多形容词、副词都可以省略而不影响文章的内容或形式。所以人们为使句子平衡，是经常写废话的。而一个很好的练习就是写一个句子，里边不能有一个对意义表达来说不必要的词，同时还得达到整体的平衡。

主题的选择当然必须慎重。选择一个需要复杂发展的主题会徒劳无功。我对完整有种天生的偏好，所以即使是在小篇幅内，也想让我的小说有个确定的结构。我不喜欢不成形的小说。我认为作家只给出他眼中的基本事实是不够的，还应施以某种形式。我所谓的基本事实当然不是单纯的基本事实，而是带有作家个性色彩的事实。这样的小说自然就都是些奇闻逸事。如果故事有趣，讲得也好，小说不会因此受损。故事是小说的基础。作家的折腾经常会把外在于小说的形式强加于它，但是经历一段时间无人问津、宣传造势、故弄玄虚的压力之后，小说会不可避免地掉头回到小说正确的功能上来，即讲好故事。

关于短篇小说的一般情况，我在《东方与西方》的序言中已经知无不言了，现在也没什么要添加的。迄今为止我已经写了大约一百个短篇小说，我发现的一个情况是：不管你想没想出故事来，完成得好还是不好，几乎全靠运气。每条街道的拐角都有故事，但是作家有可能当时不在，无法将它们拾起；或者正在看商店橱窗，没注意就走过了。他还有可能没看清故事全貌就把故事写了出来，又或者故事他在脑子里颠来倒去想了太久，都失去了新鲜感。他还有可能没从最恰当的角度写，以至于没能把故事写到最好。所以一个作家如果能构思出一个故事，还能在它正当成熟的那一刻落笔，又能把其中暗含的一切都写出来，那真是少见又幸运，是在小说这种艺术形式的局限之内所能达到的完美。但是完美很难实现。我想一卷程度适当的选集中所包含的短篇小说要是能差不多接近这一标准就算很好了。读者如果能在一本短篇小说集中发现所选的小说程度大致不差，合上书的时候能觉得好玩、有趣和感动，那就应该知足了。

除一篇以外，我写的所有小说都曾在杂志上发表过，这篇例外之作叫“书包”。当我将它寄给瑞朗时，瑞朗难过而不是愤怒地写信给我说，他对我的作品比对其他作者的宽容度都大，但是如果事关乱伦，他只能拒绝。我无法责备他。他后来在一本短篇小说集中发表了这篇作品，而这个集子收录了他认为在《大都会》任编辑的漫长生涯里他所见过的最好的短篇小说。我知道承认我的小说曾在杂志上发表等于把我自己置于恶评之下，因为把一篇小说叫成杂志小说等于判它有罪。但是当批评家们如此做之时，他们表现出的那种敏锐要少于能够合理地从他们那里期待的，同时他们也没显出他们对文学史有多少了解。因为自从杂志变成一种流行的出版方式以后，作家们就将它视为一种有用的、可向读者展示自己作品的媒介。所有伟大的短篇小说家都曾在杂志上发表过作品，比如巴尔扎克、福楼拜、莫泊桑，又比如契诃夫、亨利·詹姆斯和吉卜林。那些没在杂志上发表过的短篇小说是任何编辑都不会接受的小说，我不认为这种说法有任何轻率之处。因为一篇小说是杂志小说而谴责它是荒谬的。杂志无疑发表过很多不好的小说，但是不好的小说本来就比好的小说多；而编辑，哪怕是一本极有文学主张的杂志的编辑，也经常不得不出一些他不那么看好的小说，因为他看好的他没遇到。还有些流行杂志的编辑认为他们的读者需要某些类型的小说，于是就不接受这个类型之外的东西。他们找得到能写他们想要的那类东西的作者，这类作者通常还会把这类东西写得很好。正是这种固定模式的小说给杂志小说带来了坏名声。毕竟，没有人有义务读杂志小说。不过杂志小说还是给很多人带来了满足感，因为它能在短时间内，让这些人在幻想中经历他们在单调的现实生活中所渴望经历的那种浪漫和冒险。

经常有短篇小说集出版，我也读了不少有关它们的评论，如果允许我从中作出评判，那么在我看来，批评家们之所以犯错，就在于他们总是因为一篇小说构思精良、富有戏剧性，还有个令人意想不到的结局而将它贬低为杂志小说。如果一个大逆转的结局是一篇小说自然而然的结局，那就没什么好谴责的。相反，应该认为这样的结局是小说极大的优点。惊人的结局只有在毫无理由将它硬编出来想要刺激读者时才不好，比如欧·亨利的某些小说。有开头、中间和结尾的故事并不会因为结构齐整而损失了什么。为了做到这一点，所有好小说家都尽了全力。当下的风潮是，作者们在还不十分了解契诃夫的情况下就胡乱模仿契诃夫，于是他们写的故事可以随处开始，又可以没有任何结局地结束。他们觉得如果自己已经描述了一种情绪，或是制造了一种印象，或是刻画了一个人物，那就足够了。这也不算错，但这样写出来的不是小说，我不认为这样的东西能满足读者。读者不喜欢被遗弃在那儿自己琢磨，他希望他的问题能得到回答。这也是我尽力去做的。当我得到一个故事，却又不知其答案，我是不会动笔去写这个故事的。我在《作家笔记》中提到了一个这样的故事。因为我不期待大家读过我所有的书，因此不妨在此处再讲一遍，说不定能娱乐读者。我在印度的时候收到过一封信，写信人我不认识。他在信中讲了一个故事，觉得我能用得上：

两个年轻人在山中的一座茶园干活，因为信件要从很远的地方送来，因此他们很久才能收一次信。其中一个年轻人，我们叫他A吧，每次都能收到许多信，十封、十二封，甚至更多。另一个年轻人B则从来都没有收到过信。他会嫉妒地看着A接过邮包读信，他也想收信，哪怕一封也好。于是有一天，他们正在等信的时候，他对A说：“看，你总是有很多信，我却一封也没有。你要是给我一封信，我就给你五镑钱。”“好啊！”A说。信来了，A把信递给B，对他说：“随便挑吧。”B给了A一张五镑的钞票，把信翻看了一遍，挑出一封，剩下的还给A。晚饭前他们喝威士忌加苏打水的时候，A随意问道：“信里说什么？”“我不告诉你。”B说。A有点吃惊了，问：“那么信是谁写的呢？”“这与你无关。”B说。他们争执了一番，但是B坚持自己的权利，就是不肯告诉A他买的这封信里到底说了些什么。A生起气来。几个星期过去了，他努力劝说B让他看看那封信。B总是拒绝。最后A终于又急又气又好奇，觉得再也受不了了，就去找B，跟B说：“看，这是你的五镑钱，把信还给我吧。”“休想，”B说，“我买的，我付了钱，这是我的信，我不会放弃。”

我在《作家笔记》中说：“假如我属于现代派小说家，我会将故事按原样写下，并且就这样了事，但这违背了我的原则。我希望故事有形式，而在这个故事里，除非你给出确切的结局，不给人合理猜测的余地，否则我就不认为你给了它形式。即使你能做到把读者悬在半空中，你也不会想把自己和他一起悬在半空中。”那个写信人告诉我的这些事激起了很多人的好奇，引得加拿大的一份杂志和英国的《新政治家》杂志在互不知情的情况下，各自悬赏读者，为这个故事征集最好的结局。不过我不认为那些结局有多成功。

我曾读过一篇讲如何写短篇小说的文章。作者的某些观点是有用的，但我认为她的核心观点错了。她说短篇小说的“焦点”应该是塑造人物，故事的存在应该只是为了让人物“活起来”。奇怪的是在说这话前，她又说圣经里的那些寓言故事是有史以来写得最好的短篇小说。我却认为，想要描述浪子和他的兄弟，或那个善良的撒玛利亚人，或那个落入小偷之手的人的性格恐怕很难。实际上圣经对他们都没有性格刻画，我们只能猜测他们是哪种人，因为我们被告知的仅仅是对引出道德训诫必要的那些基本事实。一个短篇小说家是否有一个道德训诫想要指出，这才是他最该做的事。他没有描写和发展人物的余地，他能做的只是给出人物最显著的特点，让人物生动起来，好使他讲的故事具有可信性。有史以来人类就围在篝火旁，或在市场上聚拢起来听人讲故事。想要听故事的欲望就像对财物的占有欲一样，似乎深植于人类这种动物的内心。除了是个讲故事的人，我从来都不假装自己还是别的什么人。讲故事让我觉得好玩，我也讲了很多很多故事。

我写小说迄今已经有五十年了。在这段漫长的时间里，我曾亲眼见过数颗明星羞涩地爬上地平线，从天空中划过，行至中天时燃烧一会儿，闪烁着如同宝石般的光焰，然后就黯然衰落，再也不可能重新升起了。作家有其独特之处要表达，如果你对它展开分析，那就是作家天赋的个性。一个作家在他写作活动的早期会在黑暗中摸索，想要表达他的个性，然后如果他幸运，他就能成功。如果他的个性中有一种丰富性，那么他就可以在很长时间内创造出多样并且富有他个人特色的作品来。可是如果他已经到了老熟的年纪，已经给予了他所能给予的一切，那么他才尽的一天也总会到来。能从取之不尽的人性宝藏中挖掘出来的故事，他已经尽数塑造了；能从他本人个性的各个方面构造出来的角色，他也已经全部构造了。我认为没有人能从纯粹的观察中创造人物，如果人物栩栩如生，那至少在某种程度上表现了作者本人的个性。一代人已经崛起了，他们对他来说很陌生，他只能通过意志力才能明白这个新世界的喜好，他只能充当这个新世界的观察者。但是只有理解还不够，小说家还必须感受，不光是感受某种感情，还应在这种情感中感受。有些小说不写最好，如果他能使自己停止写这些小说，那就算是难得了。如果他能谨慎注意那些迹象的出现——那些迹象会告诉他，他既已说了他该说的话，他就该回归沉默——那他就是个智慧的人。

我已经写出了我最后的故事。





Books and You (Part 1)


One isn’t always as careful of what one says as one should be. When I stated in a book of mine called The Summing Up that young people often came to me for advice on the books they would do well to read, I did not reckon with the consequences. I received a multitude of letters from all manner of persons, asking me what the advice was that I gave. I answered them as best I could, but it is not possible to deal fully with such a matter in a private letter; and as many people seem to desire such guidance as I can offer, it has occurred to me that they might like to have a brief account of what suggestions I have to make from my own experience for pleasant and profitable reading.

The first thing I want to insist on is that reading should be enjoyable. Of course, there are many books that we all have to read, either to pass examinations or to acquire information, from which it is impossible to extract enjoyment. We are reading them for instruction, and the best we can hope is that our need for it will enable us to get through them without tedium. Such books we read with resignation rather than with alacrity. But that is not the sort of reading I have in mind. The books I shall mention in due course will help you neither to get a degree nor to earn your living, they will not teach you to sail a boat or get a stalled motor to run, but they will help you to live more fully. That, however, they cannot do unless you enjoy reading them.

The“you”I address is the adult whose avocations give him a certain leisure and who would like to read the books which cannot without loss be left unread. I do not address the bookworm. He can find his own way. His curiosity leads him along many unfrequented paths and he gathers delight in the discovery of half-forgotten excellence. I wish to deal only with the masterpieces which the consensus of opinion for a long time has accepted as supreme. We are all supposed to have read them; it is a pity that so few of us have. But there are masterpieces which are acknowledged to be such by all the best critics and to which the historians of literature devote considerable space, yet which no ordinary person can now read with enjoyment. They are important to the student, but changing times and changing tastes have robbed them of their savour and it is hard to read them now without an effort of will. Let me give one instance: I have read George Eliot's Adam Bede, but I cannot put my hand on my heart and say that it was with pleasure. I read it from a sense of duty: I finished it with a sigh of relief.

Now of such books as this I mean to say nothing. Every man is his own best critic. Whatever the learned say about a book, however unanimous they are in their praise of it, unless it interests you it is no business of yours. Don’t forget that critics often make mistakes, the history of criticism is full of the blunders the most eminent of them have made, and you who read are the final judge of the value to you of the book you are reading. This, of course, applies to the books I am going to recommend to your attention. We are none of us exactly like everyone else, only rather like, and it would be unreasonable to suppose that the books that have meant a great deal to me should be precisely those that will mean a great deal to you. But they are books that I feel the richer for having read, and I think I should not be quite the man I am if I had not read them. And so I beg of you, if any of you who read these pages are tempted to read the books I suggest and cannot get on with them, just put them down; they will be of no service to you if you do not enjoy them. No one is under an obligation to read poetry or fiction or the miscellaneous literature which is classed as belles-lettres. (I wish I knew the English term for this, but I don’t think there is one.) He must read them for pleasure, and who can claim that what pleases one man must necessarily please another?

But let no one think that pleasure is immoral. Pleasure in itself is a great good, all pleasure, but its consequences may be such that the sensible person eschews certain varieties of it. Nor need pleasure be gross and sensual. They are wise in their generation who have discovered that intellectual pleasure is the most satisfying and the most enduring. It is well to acquire the habit of reading. There are few sports in which you can engage to your own satisfaction after you have passed the prime of life; there are no games except patience, chess problems and crossword puzzles that you can play without someone to play them with you. Reading suffers from no such disadvantages; there is no occupation—except perhaps needlework, but that leaves the restless spirit at liberty—which you can more easily take up at any moment, for any period, and more easily put aside when other calls press upon you; there is no other amusement that can be obtained in these happy days of public libraries and cheap editions at so small a cost. To acquire the habit of reading is to construct for yourself a refuge from almost all the miseries of life. Almost all, I say, for I would not go so far as to pretend that to read a book will assuage the pangs of hunger or still the pain of unrequited love; but half a dozen good detective stories and a hot-water bottle will enable anyone to snap hisfingers at the worst cold in the head. But who is going to acquire the habit of reading for reading's sake, if he is bidden to read books that bore him?

It is more convenient to take the books of which I am now going to speak in chronological order, but I can see no reason why, if you make up your mind to read them, you should do so in that order. I think you would be much better advised to read them according to your fancy; nor do I see even why you should read them one by one. For my own part, Ifind it more agreeable to read four orfive books together. After all, you aren’t in the same mood on one day as on another, nor have you the same eagerness to read a certain book at all hours of the day. We must suit ourselves in these matters, and I have naturally adopted the plan that best suits me. In the morning before I start work I read for a while a book, either of science or philosophy, that requires a fresh and attentive brain. It sets me off for the day. Later on, when my work is done and I feel at ease, but not inclined for mental exercise of a strenuous character, I read history, essays, criticism or biography; and in the evening I read a novel. Besides these, I keep on hand a volume of poetry in case I feel in the mood for that, and by my bedside I have one of those books, too rarely to be found, alas, which you can dip into at any place and stop reading with equanimity at the end of any paragraph.

Now, the first book on my list is Defoe's Moll Flanders. No English novelist has ever achieved a greater verisimilitude thanDefoe; it is hard, indeed, when you read him, to remember that you are reading a work of fiction; it is more like a consummate piece of reporting. You are convinced that his people spoke exactly as he made them speak, and their actions are so plausible that you cannot doubt that this is how, in the circumstances, they behaved. Moll Flanders is not a moral book. It is bustling, coarse and brutal, but it has a robustness that I like to think is in the English character. Defoe had little imagination and not much humour, but he had a wide and varied experience of life and, being an excellent journalist, he had a keen eye for the curious incident and the telling detail. He had no sense of climax, he attempted no pattern; and so the reader is not swept away by a power that he does not seek to resist; he is carried along in the crowd, as it were, and it may be that when he comes to a side street he will slip down it and get away. He may, to put it plainly, after a couple of hundred pages of very much the same sort of thing feel that he has had enough. Well, that's all right. But for my part, I am quite willing to accompany my author till he brings his ribald heroine to the haven of respectability tempered with penitence.

Then I should like you to read Swift's Gulliver's Travels. I am going to deal with Doctor Johnson later on, but here I must note that, speaking of this book, he said: “When once you have thought of big men and little men, it is very easy to do all the rest.”Doctor Johnson was an excellent critic and a very wise man, but here he talked nonsense. Gulliver's Travels has wit and irony, ingenious invention, broad humour, savage satire and vigour. Its style is admirable. No one has ever written this difficult language of ours more compactly, more lucidly and more unaffectedly than Swift. I could wish thatDoctor Johnson had said of him what he said of another: “Whoever wishes to attain an English style, familiar but not coarse and elegant but not ostentatious, must give his days and nights to the volumes of Addison.”He could then have added a third to his pairs of adjectives: virile but not overweening.

Two novels come next. Fielding's Tom Jones is, perhaps, the healthiest novel in English literature. It is a dashing, brave and cheerful book, sturdy and generous; it is, of course, very frank, and Tom Jones, with his good looks and vitality, a friendly fellow whom we should all like to have known, does certain things which the moralist will deplore. But do we care? Not unless we are solemn prigs, for he is disinterested and his heart is golden. Fielding was, unlike Defoe, a conscious artist; his scheme gave him the opportunity to describe a multitude of incidents and to create a great number of personages. They are splendidly alive in a world that is pungent with the bustle and turmoil of reality. Fielding took himself seriously—as, of course, every author should—and there were many subjects of importance on which he felt called upon to deliver himself. At the beginning of each part he puts a dissertation in which he discusses one thing and another. These have humour and sincerity, but for my part I think they can be skipped without disadvantage. I have a notion that no one can read Tom Jones without delight, for it is a manly, wholesome book, without any humbug about it, and it warms the cockles of your heart.

Sterne's Tristram Shandy is a novel of very different character. You might say of it what Doctor Johnson said of Sir Charles Grandison: “If you were to read it for the story, you would hang yourself.”It is a book that, according to your temperament, you will find either as readable as anything you have ever read, or tiresome and affected. It has no unity. It has no coherence. Digression follows upon digression. But it is wonderfully original, funny and pathetic; and it increases your spiritual possessions with half a dozen characters so full of idiosyncrasy and so lovable that once you have come to know them, you feel that not to have known them would have been an irreparable loss. Nor would I have anyone fail to read Sterne's A Sentimental Journey; I have nothing to say of it except that it is enchanting.

Now let us leave fiction for a little. I suppose it is universally acknowledged that Boswell's The Life of Samuel Johnson is the greatest biography in the language. It is a book that you can read with profit and pleasure at any age. You can pick it up at any time, opening it at random, and be sure of entertainment. But to praise such a work at this time of day is absurd. I should like, however, to add to it a book that, to my mind undeservedly, is less well known. This is Boswell's The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides. The purchase by Colonel Isham of the Boswell manuscripts has resulted in a new and unexpurgated edition of it, for, as I suppose everyone knows, Boswell's manuscript was edited by Malone, who thought it proper to tone it down in accordance with the primly elegant taste of the day, and so left out much that gave the book flavour. It enlarges your knowledge both of Johnson and of Boswell, and if it increases your love and admiration for the sturdy old doctor, it adds also to your respect for his poor biographer who has been so much abused. This is not a writer to be despised who had such a quick eye for an amusing incident, so much appreciation of a racy phrase, and such a rare gift for reproducing the atmosphere of a scene and the liveliness of a conversation.

The figure of Doctor Johnson towers over the eighteenth century, and he has been accepted as representing the English character, with its sterling merits and unhappy defects, at its best. But if we have all read his biography, so that we know him more intimately than we know many of the people we have passed our lives with, few of us have read any of his writings; and yet he produced one work at least which is in the highest degree enjoyable. I know no better book to take on a holiday or to keep at one's bedside than Johnson's Lives of the Poets. It is written with limpidity. It has pungency and humour. It is full of horse sense. Though sometimes his judgments startle us—he found Gray dull and had little good to say of Milton's Lycidas—you delight in them because they are an expression of his own personality. He was as much interested in the men he wrote of as in their works, and though you may not have read a word of these, you can hardly fail to be diverted by the shrewd, lively and tolerant observation with which he portrays their authors.

I come next to a book that I name with hesitation, for, as I must remind the reader, I wish to speak here only of books that one would be the poorer for not having read, and though I have a great fondness for Gibbon's Autobiography, I am not quite sure that it would have made much difference to me not to have read it. I should certainly have lost a keen pleasure, but if I mention it I feel that I should mention also a large number of other works, not so great as the greatest, to be judged by a different standard, and they would need a chapter to themselves. But Gibbon's Autobiography is very readable; it is short, written with the peculiar elegance of which he was master, and it has both dignity and humour. Of the latter I cannot resist giving an example. When he was at Lausanne he fell in love, but his father threatening to disinherit him, he prudently gave up the thought of marrying the object of his affections. He ends his recital of the episode with these words: “I sighed as a lover, I obeyed as a son; and my wound was insensibly healed by time, absence, and the habits of a new life.”I think if the book contained nothing else, it would be worth reading for that delicious sentence.

Now I want to abandon the chronological order to which I have till now roughly adhered, in order to speak of two great novels, David Copperfield and Butler's The Way of All Flesh. This I do, not only because they are to a notable degree in the great tradition of the English novel, but also because they have eminently the features which, when I think of the works I have hitherto summarily considered, seem characteristic of English literature. With the possible exception of Tristram Shandy, all these books have in common something robust, straight-forward, humorous and healthy which, I like to think, is representative of the race. There is no especial subtlety in them and they are somewhat wanting in delicacy. It is a literature of men of action rather than of men of thought. There is a lot of common sense about it, some sentimentality and a great deal of humanity. Of David Copperfield there is nothing to be said but that it is Dickens’ best novel. His defects are here least noticeable and his merits most remarkable. Many long novels have been written since The Way of All Flesh, but I think it is the last English novel to have been written in the grand manner; it is the last, of any importance, that owes nothing to the great novelists of France and Russia. It is a worthy successor of Tom Jones, and its author had in him something of the old lexicographer whom we have agreed to regard as the typical Englishman.

Then I go back to Jane Austen. I would not claim that she is England's greatest novelist; with all his faults of exaggeration, vulgarity, wordiness and sentimentality, Dickens remains that. He was prodigious. He did not describe the world as we know it; he created a world. He had suspense, drama and humour, and thus was able to give the feel of the multifariousness and bustle of life as, so far as I know, only one other novelist, Tolstoy, has done. Out of his immense vitality he fashioned a whole series of characters, diverse, individual, and tremulous with—no, “tremulous”isn’t the right word—turbulent with life. He managed his complicated and often highly improbable stories with a dashing skill that perhaps you must be a novelist thoroughly to appreciate. But Jane Austen is perfect. It is true that her scope is restricted; she deals with a little world of country gentlefolk, clergymen and middle-class persons; but who has equalled her insight into character or surpassed the delicacy and reasonableness with which she probed its depths? She does not need my praise. The only characteristic I would like to impress upon your attention is one which she exhibits with so much ease that you might well take it for granted. Though, on the whole, nothing very much happens in her stories, and she mostly eschews dramatic incident, you are inveigled, I hardly know how, to turn from page to page by the urgent desire to know what is going to happen next; and that is the novelist's essential gift. Without it he is done. I can think of no one who possessed it more fully than Jane Austen. My only difficulty now is to decide which of her few novels especially to recommend. For my part, I like Mansfield Park best. I recognize that its heroine is a little prig and its hero a pompous ass, but I do not care; it is wise, witty and tender, a masterpiece of ironical humour and subtle observation.

At this point I would draw your attention to Hazlitt. His fame has been overshadowed by that of Charles Lamb, but to my mind he was the better essayist. Charles Lamb, a charming, gentle, witty creature whom to know was to love, has always appealed to the affections of his readers. Hazlitt could hardly do that. He was rude, tactless, envious and quarrelsome; a man, in truth, of an unpleasing character; but, unfortunately, it is not always the most worthy men who write the best books. In the end it is the personality of the artist that counts, and for my part Ifind more to interest me in the tormented, striving, acrimonious soul of Hazlitt than in Charles Lamb's patient but somewhat maudlin amiability. As a writer, Hazlitt was vigorous, bold and healthy. What he had to say, he said with decision. His essays are full of meat, and when you have read one of them you feel, not as you do when you have read one of Lamb's, that you have made a meal of savoury kickshaws, but that you have satisfied your appetite with substantial fare. Much of his best work can be found in his Table Talk, but there have been published a number of selections from his essays, and none of these can fail to contain My First Acquaintance with Poets, which, I suppose, is not only the most thrilling piece he ever wrote but the finest essay in the English language.

Now, two more novels: Thackeray's Vanity Fair, and Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights. I can say little about them, for my space is growing short. Critics nowadays are inclined to carp at Thackeray. Perhaps he was unfortunate in his period. He should have lived and written in our own time, when he would not have been hampered by the conventions which prevented the Victorian novelist from telling the truth, however bitter, as he saw it. His point of view was modern. He was deeply conscious of the mediocrity of human beings and he was interested in the contradictions of their natures. And however much you may deplore his sentimentality and his sermonizing or regret the weakness that led him to defer unduly to the demands of the public, the fact remains that in Becky Sharp he created one of the most real, living and forcible characters in English fiction.

Wuthering Heights is unique. It is an awkward novel to read, because sometimes it so outrages probability that you are completely bewildered; but it is passionate and profoundly moving; it has the depth and power of a great poem. To read it is not like reading a work of fiction, in which, however absorbed, you can remind yourself, if need be, that it is only a story; it is to have a shattering experience in your own life.

I can but name three novels which I think it would be a pity to have left unread. They are George Eliot's Middlemarch, Trollope's The Eustace Diamonds and Meredith's The Egoist.

The reader will have noticed, perhaps with surprise, that hitherto I have said nothing of poetry. I do not think our race has produced either painters, sculptors or composers who can rank with the best of other countries; their achievements have been respectable rather than pre-eminent; but I do not believe it is a racial or national bias that leads me to claim that our poets are supreme. But because poetry is the flower and crown of literature, it cannot afford to be mediocre. I remember Edmund Gosse telling me that he would much rather read a volume of minor verse than an average novel; it took less time, he said, and required no mental effort. Well, I have no use for verse, however accomplished; to me, unless poetry is great, it is nothing, and I would sooner read a newspaper. I cannot read poetry at all times and in all places. I want to be in a particular mood and I want a favourable environment, I like to read poetry in a garden towards the end of a summer day; I like to sit on a cliff with a view of the sea or to lie on a mossy bank in a wood and take out the volume I have brought in my pocket. But even the greatest poets have written a great deal that is tedious to read; many versifiers have written endless volumes and in the end produced no more than two or three poems. I think that is enough to justify them, but I do not want to read so much to gain so little. I like anthologies. The critics, I understand, have a contempt for them; they say that in order to appreciate an author you must read him in full. But I do not read poetry as a critic; I read it as a human being in need of solace, refreshment and peace. I am thankful to the sensitive scholar who has taken the trouble to weed out from the great mass of English poetry what is not so good and has left for my perusal only what is to my purpose. The three best anthologies I know are Palgrave's Golden Treasury, The Oxford Book of English Verse, and the admirable English Galaxy of Shorter Poems, by Gerald Bullett. But we live in the world of to-day and we should not neglect the writings of the poets of our own time. They, too, may have something important to give us. Unfortunately, the only anthology that, to my knowledge, has been made of them is so inadequate that I forbear even to name it.

Of course, everyone must read the great tragedies of Shakespeare. He is not only the greatest poet that ever lived but the glory of our race. But knowing, as I do, these plays pretty well, I wish that someone with taste, knowledge and discretion could be found who would make an anthology of Shakespeare's plays and poems, putting in not only the famous passages with which we should all be familiar but also fragments, single lines even; so that I might have in a convenient volume a book to which I could always turn when I wanted the cream of all poetry. (Since I wrote these lines George Rylands has produced an anthology under the title of The Ages of Man which comes as near fulfilling the wish I have here expressed as, I suppose, anyone can expect. It is a welcome gift to a troubled world.)





Henry Fielding and Tom Jones


1


The difficulty of writing about Henry Fielding, the man, is that very little is known about him. Arthur Murphy, who wrote a short life of him in 1762, only eight years after his death, as an introduction to an edition of his works, seems to have known him, if he knew him at all, only in his later years, and had so little material to work with that, presumably to fill the eighty pages of his essay, he indulged in long and tedious digressions. The facts he tells are few, and subsequent research has shown that they are not always accurate. The last writer to deal at length with Fielding is Dr. Homes Dudden, Master of Pembroke, Oxford. The two stout volumes of his work are a monument of painstaking industry. By giving a lively picture of the political circumstances of the times, and a vivid account of the Young Pretender's disastrous adventure in 1745, he has added colour, depth and substance to the narrative of his hero's checkered career. I don’t believe that there is anything to be said about Henry Fielding that the eminent author has left unsaid.

Fielding was a gentleman born. His father was the third son of John Fielding, a Canon of Salisbury, and he in turn was the fifth son of an Earl of Desmond. The Desmonds were a younger branch of the family of Denbigh, who flattered themselves that they were descended from the Habsburgs. Gibbon, the Gibbon of The Decline and Fall, wrote in his autobiography: “The successors of Charles the Fifth may disclaim their brethren of England; but the romance of Tom Jones, that exquisite picture of human manners, will outlive the palace of the Escorial, and the imperial eagle of the House of Austria.”The phrase has a fine resonance, and it is a pity that the claim of these noble lords has been shown to have no foundation. They spelt their name Feilding, and there is a well-known story that on one occasion the then Earl asked Henry Fielding how this came about; whereupon he answered: “I can only suppose it is because my branch of the family learnt to spell before your lordship's.”

Fielding's father entered the army and served in the wars under Marlborough“with much bravery and reputation.”He married Sarah, the daughter of Sir Henry Gould, a Judge of the King's Bench; and at his country seat, Sharpham Park, near Glastonbury, our author was born in 1707. Two or three years later the Fieldings, who by this time had had two more children, daughters, moved to East Stour in Dorsetshire, a property which the judge had settled on his daughter, and there three more girls and a boy were born. Mrs. Fielding died in 1718, and in the following year Henry went to Eton. Here he made some valuable friends and, if he did not leave, as Arthur Murphy states, “uncommonly well versed in the Greek authors and an early master of the Latin classics, ”he certainly acquired a real love for classical learning. Later in life, when he was ill and poverty-stricken, he found comfort in reading Cicero's De Consolatione; and when, dying, he set out in the ship that took him to Lisbon, he carried with him a volume of Plato.

On leaving Eton, instead of going up to a university, he lived for a while at Salisbury with his grandmother, Lady Gould, the judge being dead; and there, according to Dr. Dudden, read some law and a good deal of miscellaneous literature. He was then a handsome youth, over six feet tall, strong and active, with deep-set eyes, a Roman nose, a short upper lip with an ironical curl to it, and a stubborn, prominent chin. His hair was brown and curly, his teeth white and even. By the time he was eighteen, he gave promise of the sort of man he was going to be. He happened to be staying at Lyme Regis with a trusty servant, ready to“beat, maim or kill”for his master, and there fell in love with a Miss Sarah Andrews, whose considerable fortune added to the charm of her beauty, and he concocted a scheme to carry her off, by main force if necessary, and marry her. It was discovered, and the young woman was hurried away and safely married to a more eligible suitor. For all one knows to the contrary, Fielding spent the next two or three years in London, with an allowance from his grandmother, engaging in the gaieties of the town as agreeably as a well-connected young man can do when he has good looks and charm of manner. In 1728, by the in fluence of his cousin, Lady Mary Wortley-Montagu, and with the help of the charming, but not particularly chaste, actress, Anne Oldfield, a play of Fielding's was put on by Colley Cibber at Drury Lane. It was called Love in Several Masques and was given four performances. Shortly after this, he entered the University of Leyden with an allowance from his father of two hundred pounds a year. But his father had married again and either could not, or would not, continue to pay him the allowance he had promised, so after about a year Fielding was obliged to return to England. He was in such straits then that, as in his light-hearted way he put it himself, he had no choice but to be a hackney coachman or a hackney writer.

Austin Dobson, who wrote his life for The English Men of Letters Series, says that“his inclinations as well as his opportunities led him to the stage.”He had the high spirits, the humour, the keen-witted observation of the contemporary scene, which are needed by the playwright; and he seems to have had besides some ingenuity and a sense of construction. The“inclinations”of which Austin Dobson speaks may very well mean that he had the vicarious exhibitionism which is part of the playwright's make-up, and that he looked upon writing plays as an easy way to make quick money; the“opportunities”may be a delicate way of saying that he was a handsome fellow of exuberant virility and had taken the fancy of a popular actress. To please a leading lady has ever been the surest way for a young dramatist to get his play produced. Between 1729 and 1737 Fielding composed or adapted twenty-six plays, of which at least three greatly pleased the town; and one of which made Swift laugh, a thing that to the best of the Dean's recollection he had only done twice in his life before. Fielding did not do very well when he attempted pure comedy; his great successes seem to have been in a genre which, so far as I know, he devised himself, an entertainment in which there were singing and dancing, brief topical sketches, parodies and allusions to public figures: in fact, something indistinguishable from the revues popular in our own day. According to Arthur Murphy, Fielding's farces“were generally the production of two or three mornings, so great was his facility in writing.”Dr. Dudden looks upon this as an exaggeration. I don’t think it is. Some of these pieces were very short, and I have myself heard of light comedies that were written over a week-end and were none the worse for that. The last two plays Fielding wrote were attacks on the political corruption of the times, and the attacks were effective enough to cause the Ministry to pass a Licensing Act which obliged managers to obtain the Lord Chamberlain's licence to produce a play. This act still obtains to torment British authors. After this, Fielding wrote only rarely for the theatre and, when he did, presumably for no other reason than that he was more than usually hard up.

I will not pretend that I have read his plays, but I have flipped through the pages, reading a scene here and there, and the dialogue seems natural and sprightly. The most amusing bit I have come across is the description which, after the fashion of the day, he gives in the list of Dramatis Personæ in Tom Thumb the Great: “A woman entirely faultless, save that she is a little given to drink.”It is usual to dismiss Fielding's plays as of no account, and doubtless no one would give them a thought if he were not the author of Tom Jones. They lack the literary distinction (such as Congreve's plays have) which the critic, reading them in his library two hundred years later, would like them to have. But plays are written to be acted, not to be read; it is certainly well for them to have literary distinction; but it is not that which makes them good plays, it may (and often does) make them less actable. Fielding's plays have by now lost what merit they had, for the drama depends very much on actuality and so is ephemeral, almost as ephemeral as a newspaper, and Fielding’ plays, as I have said, owed their success to the fact that they were topical; but light as they were, they must have had merit, for neither a young man's wish to write plays, nor pressure brought to bear by a favourite actress, will induce managers to put on play after play unless they please the public. For in this matter the public is the final judge. Unless the manager can gauge their taste, he will go bankrupt. Fielding's plays had at least the merit that the public liked to go to see them. Tom Thumb the Great ran for“upwards of forty nights, ”and Pasquin for sixty, which was as long as The Beggar's Opera had run.

Fielding had no illusions about the worth of his plays, and himself said that he left off writing for the stage when he should have begun. He wrote for money, and had no great respect for the understanding of an audience.“When he had contracted to bring on a play, or a farce, ”says Murphy, “it is well known by many of his friends now living, that he would go home rather late from a tavern and would, the next morning, deliver a scene to the players, written upon the papers which had wrapped the tobacco, in which he so much delighted.”During the rehearsals of a comedy called The Wedding Day, Garrick, who was playing in it, objected to a scene and asked Fielding to cut it.“No, damn ’em, ”said Fielding, “if the scene isn’t a good one let them find it out.”The scene was played, the audience noisily expressed their displeasure, and Garrick retired to the green-room where his author was“indulging his genius and solacing himself with a bottle of champagne. He had by this time drunk pretty plentifully; and cocking his eye at the actor, with streams of tobacco trickling down from the corner of his mouth, ‘What's the matter, Garrick, ’ says he, ‘what are they hissing now?’

“‘Why, the scene that I begged you to retrench; I knew it would not do; and they have so frightened me, that I shall not be able to collect myself the whole night.’

“‘Oh, damn ’em, ’ replies the author, ‘they have found it out, have they?’”

This story is told by Arthur Murphy, and I am bound to say that I doubt its truth. I have known and had dealings with actor-managers, which is what Garrick was, and it does seem to me very unlikely that he would have consented to play a scene which he thought would wreck the play; but the anecdote wouldn’t have been invented unless it had been plausible. It at least indicates how Fielding's friends and boon-companions regarded him.

If I have dwelt on his activity as a playwright, though it was after all not much more than an episode in his career, it is because I think it was important to his development as a novelist. Quite a number of eminent novelists have tried their hands at playwriting, but I cannot think of any that have conspicuously succeeded. The fact is that the techniques are very different, and to have learnt how to write a novel is of no help when it comes to writing a play. The novelist has all the time he wants to develop his theme, he can describe his characters as minutely as he chooses and make their behaviour plain to the reader by relating their motives; if he is skilful, he can give verisimilitude to improbabilities; if he has a gift for narrative, he can gradually work up to a climax which a long preparation makes more striking (a supreme example of this is Clarissa's letter in which she announced her seduction); he does not have to show action, but only to tell it; he can make the persons explain themselves in dialogue for as many pages as he likes. But a play depends on action, and by action, of course, I don’t mean violent action like falling off a precipice or being run over by a bus; such an action as handing a person a glass of water may be of the highest dramatic intensity. The power of attention that an audience has is very limited, and it must be held by a constant succession of incidents; something fresh must be doing all the time; the theme must be presented at once and its development must follow a definite line, without digression into irrelevant bypaths; the dialogue must be crisp and to the point, and it must be so put that the listener can catch its meaning without having to stop and think; the characters must be all of a piece, easily grasped by the eye and the understanding, and however complex, their complexity must be plausible. A play cannot afford loose ends; however slight, its foundation must be secure and its structure solid.

When the playwright, who has acquired the qualities which I have suggested are essential to writing a play which audiences will sit through with pleasure, starts writing novels, he is at an advantage. He has learnt to be brief; he has learnt the value of rapid incident; he has learnt not to linger on the way, but to stick to his point and get on with his story; he has learnt to make his characters display themselves by their words and actions, without the help of description; and so, when he comes to work on the larger canvas which the novel allows, he can not only profit by the advantages peculiar to the form of the novel, but his training as a playwright will enable him to make his novel lively, swift-moving and dramatic. These are excellent qualities, and some very good novelists, whatever their other merits, have not possessed them. I cannot look upon the years Fielding spent writing plays as wasted; I think, on the contrary, the experience he gained then was of value to him when he came to writing novels.

In 1734 Fielding married Charlotte Cradock. She was one of the two daughters of a widow who lived in Salisbury, and nothing is known of her but that she was beautiful and charming. Mrs. Cradock was a worldly, strong-minded woman, who apparently did not approve of Fielding's attentions to her daughter, and she can hardly be blamed for that, since his means of livelihood were uncertain and his connection with the theatre can hardly have inspired a prudent mother with confidence; anyhow, the lovers eloped, and though Mrs. Cradock pursued, “she did not catch up with them in time to stop the marriage.”Fielding has described Charlotte as Sophia in Tom Jones and again as Amelia in the novel of that name, so that the reader of those books can gain a very exact notion of what she looked like in the eyes of her lover and husband. Mrs. Cradock died a year later and left Charlotte fifteen hundred pounds. It came at a fortunate moment, since a play that Fielding had produced early in the year was a disastrous failure, and he was very short of cash. He had been in the habit of staying from time to time on the small estate which had been his mother's, and he went there now with his young wife. He spent the next nine months lavishly entertaining his friends and enjoying the various pursuits which the country offered, and on his return to London with what, it may be supposed, remained of Charlotte's legacy he took the Little Theatre in the Haymarket, and there presently produced the best (they say) and the most successful of his plays—Pasquin; a Dramatic Satire on the Times.

When the Licensing Act became law, and so put an end to his theatrical career, Fielding had a wife and two children and precious little money to support them on. He had to find a means of livelihood. He was thirty-one. He entered the Middle Temple, and though, according to Arthur Murphy, “it happened that the early taste he had taken of pleasure would occasionally return upon him; and conspire with his spirit and vivacity to carry him into the wild enjoyments of the town, ”he worked hard, and he was in due course called to the bar. He was ready to follow his profession with assiduity, but he seems to have had few briefs; and it may well be that the attorneys were suspicious of a man who was known only as a writer of light comedies and political satires. Moreover, within three years of being called, he began to suffer from frequent attacks of gout which prevented him from regularly attending the courts. In order to make money he was obliged to do hack work for the papers. He found time, meanwhile, to write Joseph Andrews, his first novel. Two years later his wife died. Her death left him distracted with grief. Lady Louisa Stuart wrote: “He loved her passionately, and she returned his affection; yet led no happy life, for they were almost always miserably poor, and seldom in a state of quiet and safety. All the world knows what was his imprudence; if ever he possessed a score of pounds nothing could keep him from lavishing it idly, or make him think of tomorrow. Sometimes they were living in decent lodgings with tolerable comfort; sometimes in a wretched garret without necessaries, not to speak of the sponging-houses and hiding places where he was occasionally to be found. His elastic gaiety of spirit carried him through it all; but, meanwhile, care and anxiety were preying upon her more delicate mind, and undermining her constitution. She gradually declined, caught a fever, and died in his arms.”This has an air of truth, and is in part confirmed by Fielding's Amelia. We know that novelists habitually make use of any little experience that they have had, and when Fielding created the character of Billy Booth, he not only drew a portrait of himself and of his wife as Amelia, but utilized various incidents in their married life. Four years after his wife's death he married her maid, Mary Daniel. She was at the time three months pregnant. The marriage shocked his friends, and his sister, who had lived with him since Charlotte's death, left the house. His cousin Lady Mary Wortley-Montagu was haughtily scornful because he could“feel rapture with his cook-maid.”Mary Daniel had few personal charms, but she was an excellent creature and he never spoke of her but with affection and respect. She was a very decent woman, who looked after him well, a good wife and a good mother. She bore him two boys and a girl.

When still a struggling dramatist, Fielding had made advances to Sir Robert Walpole, then all-powerful; but though he dedicated to him with effusive compliments his play, The Modern Husband, the ungrateful minister seems to have been disinclined to do anything for him. He therefore decided that he could do better with the party opposed to Walpole, and forthwith made overtures to Lord Chesterfield, one of its leaders. As Dr. Dudden puts it: “He could hardly have given a broader hint that he was ready to place his wit and humour at the disposal of the opposition, should they be willing to employ him.”Eventually they showed themselves willing, and Fielding was made editor of a paper called The Champion, founded to attack and ridicule Sir Robert and his ministry. Walpole fell in 1742 and, after a brief interlude, was succeeded by Henry Pelham. The party Fielding worked for was now in power, and for some years he edited and wrote for the papers which supported and defended the government. He naturally expected that his services should be rewarded. Among the friends he had made at Eton, and whose friendship he had retained, was George Lyttelton, a member of a distinguished political family (distinguished to the present day) and a generous patron of literature. Lyttelton was made a Lord of the Treasury in Henry Pelham's Government, and in 1784 by his in fluence Fielding was made Justice of the Peace for Westminster. Presently, so that he might discharge his duties more effectively, his jurisdiction was extended over Middlesex, and he established himself with his family in the official residence in Bow Street. He was well fitted for the post by his training as a lawyer, his knowledge of life and his natural gifts. Fielding says that before his accession the job was worth five hundred pounds a year of dirty money, but that he made no more than three hundred a year of clean. Through the Duke of Bedford he was granted a pension out of the public-service money. It is supposed that this was either one or two hundred pounds a year. In 1749 he published Tom Jones, which he must have been writing when he was still editing a paper on behalf of the Government. He received altogether seven hundred pounds for it, and since money at that period was worth five or six times at least what it is worth now, this sum was equivalent to something like four thousand pounds. That would be good payment for a novel to-day.

Fielding's health by now was poor. His attacks of gout were frequent, and he had often to go to Bath to recuperate, or to a cottage he had near London. But he did not cease to write. He wrote pamphlets concerning his office; one, an Enquiry into the Causes of the Late Menace of Robbers is said to have caused the famous Gin Act to be passed; and he wrote Amelia. His industry was indeed amazing. Amelia was published in 1751 and in the same year Fielding undertook to edit still another paper, The Covent Garden Journal. Hishealth grew worse. It was evident that he could no longer perform his duties at Bow Street, and in 1754, after breaking up“a gang of villains and cut-throats”who had become the terror of London, he resigned his office to his half-brother, John Fielding. It looked as though his only chance of life was to seek a milder climate than that of England, and so, in the June of that year, 1754, he left his native country in The Queen of Portugal, Richard Veal, master, for Lisbon. He arrived in August, and two months later died. He was forty-seven years old.

When I consider Fielding's life, which from inadequate material I have briefly sketched, I am seized with a singular emotion. He was a man. As you read his novels, and few novelists have put more of themselves into their books than he, you feel the same sort of affection as you feel for someone with whom you have been for years intimate. There is something contemporary about him. There is a sort of Englishman that till recently was far from uncommon. You might meet him in London, at Newmarket, in Leicestershire during the hunting season, at Cowes in August, at Cannes or Monte Carlo in midwinter. He is a gentleman, and he has good manners. He is good-looking, good-natured, friendly and easy to get on with. He is not particularly cultured, but he is tolerant of those who are. He is fond of the girls and is apt to find himself cited as a co-respondent. He is not one of the world's workers, but he sees no reason why he should be. Though he does nothing, he is far from idle. He has an adequate income and is free with his money. If war breaks out, he joins up and his gallantry is conspicuous. There is absolutely no harm in him and everyone likes him. The years pass and youth is over, he is not so well-off any more and life is not so easy as it was. He has had to give up hunting, but he still plays a good game of golf and you are always glad to see him in the card-room of your club. He marries an old flame, a widow with money, and, settling down to middle age, makes her a very good husband. The world to-day has no room for him and, in a few years, his type will be extinct. Such a man, I fancy, was Fielding. But he happened to have the great gift which made him the writer he was and, when he wanted to, he could work hard. He was fond of the bottle and he liked women. When people speak of virtue, it is generally sex they have in mind, but chastity is only a small part of virtue, and perhaps not the chief one. Fielding had strong passions, and he had no hesitation in yielding to them. He was capable of loving tenderly. Now love, not affection, which is a different thing, is rooted in sex, but there can be sexual desire without love. It is only hypocrisy or ignorance that denies it. Sexual desire is an animal instinct, and there is nothing more shameful in it than in thirst or hunger, and no more reason not to satisfy it. If Fielding enjoyed, somewhat promiscuously, the pleasures of sex, he was not worse than most men. Like most of us, he regretted his sins, if sins they are, but when opportunity occurred, committed them again. He was hot-tempered, but kind-hearted, generous and, in a corrupt age honest; an affectionate husband and father; courageous and truthful, and a good friend to his friends, who till his death remained faithful to him. Though tolerant to the faults of others, he hated brutality and double-dealing. He was not puffed up by success and, with the help of a brace of partridges and a bottle of claret, bore adversity with fortitude. He took life as it came, with high spirits and good humour, and enjoyed it to the full. In fact he was very like his own Tom Jones, and not unlike his own Billy Booth. He was a very proper man.

I should, however, tell the reader that the picture I have drawn of Henry Fielding does not at all accord with that drawn by the Master of Pembroke in the monumental work to which I have often referred, and to which I owe much useful information.“Until comparatively recently, ”he writes, “the conception of Fielding which prevailed in the popular imagination was that of a man of brilliant genius, endowed with what is called‘a good heart’ and many amiable qualities, but dissipated and irresponsible, guilty of regrettable follies, and not wholly unstained even by graver vices.”And he has done his best to persuade his readers that Fielding has been grossly maligned.

But this conception, which Dr. Dudden tries to refute, is that which prevailed in Fielding's lifetime. It was held by persons who knew him well. It is true that he was violently attacked in his own day by his political and literary enemies, and it is very likely that the charges that were brought against him were exaggerated; but if charges are to be damaging they must be plausible. For example: the late Sir Stafford Cripps had many bitter enemies who were only too anxious to throw mud at him; they said that he was a turncoat and a traitor to his class; but it would never have occurred to them to say that he was a lecher and a drunkard, since he was well-known to be a man of high moral character and fiercely abstemious. It would only have made them absurd. In the same way, the legends that gather round a famous man may not be true, but they will not be believed unless they are specious. Arthur Murphy relates that on one occasion Fielding, in order to pay the tax-collector, got his publisher to give him an advance and, while taking the money home, met a friend who was in even worse case than himself; so he gave him the money and, when the tax-collector called, sent him the message: “Friendship has called for the money and had it; let the collector call again.”Dr. Dudden shows that there can be no truth in the anecdote; but if it was invented, it is because it was credible. Fielding was accused of being a spendthrift; he probably was; it went with his insouciance, his high spirits, his friendliness, conviviality and indifference to money. He was thus often in debt and probably on occasion haunted by“duns and bumbailiffs”; there is little doubt that when he was at his wit's end for money he applied to his friends for help and they gave it. So did the noble-minded Edmund Burke. As a playwright, Fielding had lived for years in theatrical circles, and the theatre has in no country, either in the past or the present, been regarded as a favourable place to teach the young a rigid continence. Anne Oldfield, by whose influence Fielding had his first play produced, was buried in Westminster Abbey; but since she had been kept by two gentlemen, and had had two illegitimate children, permission to honour her with a monument was refused. It would be strange if she did not grant her favours to the handsome youth that Fielding then was; and, since he was pretty well penniless, it would not be surprising if she had helped him with some of the funds she received from her protectors. It may be that his poverty, but not his will, consented. If in his youth he was much given to wenching, he was no different from most young men in his day (and ours) who had his opportunities and advantages. And, doubtless, he spent“many anight drinking deep in taverns.”Whatever philosophers may aver, common sense is pretty well agreed that there is a different morality for youth and age, and a different one according to the station in life. It would be reprehensible for a doctor of divinity to engage in promiscuous fornication, but natural for a young man to do so; and it would be unpardonable for the master of a college to get drunk, but to be expected on occasion, and not really disapproved, in an undergraduate.

Fielding's enemies accuse him of being a political hireling. He was. He was quite ready to put his great gifts at the service of Sir Robert Walpole and, when he found they were not wanted, he was equally ready to put them at the service of his enemies. That demanded no particular sacrifice of principle, since at that time the only real difference between the Government and the Opposition was that the Government enjoyed the emoluments of office and the Opposition did not. Corruption was universal, and great lords were as willing to change sides when it was to their advantage as was Fielding when it was a question of bread and butter. It should be said to his credit that when Walpole discovered he was dangerous, and offered to give him his own terms if he would desert the Opposition, he refused. It was also intelligent of him, for not so long afterwards Walpole fell! Fielding had a number of friends in the higher ranks of society, and friends eminent in the arts, but from his writings it seems certain that he enjoyed the company of the low and disreputable. He was severely censured for this, but it seems to me that he could not have described with such wonderful vivacity scenes of what is called low-life unless he had himself taken part in them, and enjoyed it. Common opinion in his own day decided that Fielding was licentious and profligate. The evidence that he was is too great to be ignored. If he had been the respectable, chaste, abstemious creature that the Master of Pembroke would have us believe, it is surely very unlikely that he would have written Tom Jones. I think what has misled Dr. Dudden, in his perhaps meritorious attempt to whitewash Fielding, is that it has not occurred to him that contradictory, and even mutually exclusive, qualities may exist in the same man and somehow or other form a tolerably plausible harmony. That is natural enough in one who has led a sheltered, academic life. Because Fielding was generous, good-hearted, upright, kindly, affectionate and honest, it has seemed to the Master impossible that he should have been at the same time a spendthrift who would cadge a dinner and a guinea from his rich friends, who would haunt taverns and drink to the ruin of his health, and who would engage in sexual congress whenever he had the chance. Dr. Dudden states that, as long as his first wife lived, Fielding was absolutely faithful to her. How does he know? Certainly Fielding loved her, he loved her passionately, but he would not have been the first loving husband who, when the circumstances were propitious, had a flutter on the side; and it is very probable that after such an occurrence, like his own Captain Booth in similar circumstances, he bitterly regretted it; but that did not prevent him from transgressing again when the opportunity offered.

In one of her letters Lady Mary Wortley-Montagu wrote: “I am sorry for H. Fielding's death, not only as I shall read no more of his writings, but I believe he lost more than others, as no man enjoyed life more than he did, though few had less reason to do so, the highest of his preferment being raking in the lowest sinks of vice and misery. I should think it a nobler and less nauseous employment to be one of the staff officers that conduct the nocturnal weddings. His happy constitution (even when he had, with great pains, half demolished it) made him forget everything when he was before a venison pasty, or over a flask of champagne; and I am persuaded he has known more happy moments than any prince upon earth.”

There are people who cannot read Tom Jones. I am not thinking of those who never read anything but the newspapers and the illustrated weeklies, or of those who never read anything but detective stories; I am thinking of those who would not demur if you classed them as members of the intelligentsia, of those who read and re-read Pride and Prejudice with delight, Middlemarch with self-complacency, and The Golden Bowl with reverence. The chances are that it has never even occurred to them to read Tom Jones; but, sometimes, they have tried and not been able to get on with it. It bores them. Now it is no good saying that they ought to like it. There is no ought about the matter. You read a novel for its entertainment, and, I repeat, if it does not give you that, it has nothing to give you at all. No one has the right to blame you because you don’t find it interesting, any more than anyone has the right to blame you because you don’t like oysters. I cannot but ask myself, however, what it is that puts readers off a book which Gibbon described as an exquisite picture of human manners, which Walter Scott praised as truth and human nature itself, which Dickens admired and profited by, and of which Thackeray wrote: “The novel of Tom Jones is indeed exquisite; as a work of construction quite a wonder; the by-play of wisdom, the power of observation, the multiplied felicitous turns and thoughts, the varied character of the great comic epic, keep the reader in a perpetual admiration and curiosity.”Is it that they cannot interest themselves in the way of life, the manners and customs, of persons who lived two hundred years ago? Is it the style? It is easy and natural. It has been said, I forget by whom, Fielding's friend, Lord Chesterfield, perhaps, that a good style should resemble the conversation of cultivated man. That is precisely what Fielding's style does. He is talking to the reader and telling him the story of Tom Jones as he might tell it over the dinner-table with a bottle of wine to a number of friends. He does not mince his words. The beautiful and virtuous Sophia was apparently quite used to hearing such words as“whore, ”“bastard, ”“strumpet, ”and that which, for a reason hard to guess, Fielding writes“b…ch.”In fact, there were moments when her father, Squire Western, applied them very freely to her.

The conversational method of writing a novel, the method in which the author takes you into his confidence, telling you what he feels about the creatures of his invention and the situations in which he has placed them has its dangers. The author is always at your elbow, and so hinders your immediate communication with the persons of his story. He is apt to irritate you sometimes by moralizing and once he starts to digress, is apt to be tedious. You do not want to hear what he has to say on some moral or social point; you want him to get on with his story. Fielding's digressions are nearly always sensible or amusing; they are brief, and he has the grace to apologize for them. His good nature shines through them. When Thackeray unwisely imitated him in this, he was priggish, sanctimonious and, you cannot but suspect, insincere.

Fielding prefaced each of the books into which Tom Jones is divided with an essay. Some critics have greatly admired them, and have looked upon them as adding to the excellence of the novel. I can only suppose that is because they were not interested in it as a novel. An essayist takes a subject and discusses it. If his subject is new to you, he may tell you something that you didn’t know before, but new subjects are hard to find and, in general, he expects to interest you by his own attitude and the characteristic way in which he regards things. That is to say, he expects to interest you in himself. But that is not what you want to do when you read a novel. You don’t care about the author; he is there to tell you a story and introduce you to a group of characters. The reader of a novel should want to know what happens next to the persons in whom the author has interested him and, if he doesn’t, there is no reason for him to read the novel at all. For the novel, I can never repeat too often, is not to be looked upon as a medium of instruction or edification, but as a source of intelligent diversion. It appears that Fielding wrote the essays with which he introduced the successive books of Tom Jones after he had finished the novel. They have hardly anything to do with the books they introduce; they gave him, he admits, a lot of trouble, and one wonders why he wrote them at all. He cannot have been unaware that many readers would look upon his novel as low, none too moral, and possibly even bawdy; and it may be that by them he thought to give it a certain elevation. These essays are sensible, and sometimes uncommonly shrewd; and when you know the novel well, you can read them with a certain amount of pleasure; but anyone who is reading Tom Jones for the first time is well advised to skip them. The plot of Tom Jones has been much admired. I learn from Dr. Dudden that Coleridge exclaimed: “What a master of composition Fielding was!”Scott and Thackeray were equally enthusiastic. Dr. Dudden quotes the latter as follows: “Moral or immoral, let any man examine this romance as a work of art merely, and it must strike him as the most astonishing production of human ingenuity. There is not an incident ever so trifling but advances the story, grows out of former incidents, and is connected with the whole. Such a literary providence, if we may use such a word, is not to be seen in any other work of fiction. You might cut out half of Don Quixote, or add, transpose, or alter any given romance of Walter Scott, and neither would suffer. Roderick Random and heroes of that sort run through a series of adventures, at the end of which the fiddles are brought, and there is a marriage. But the history of Tom Jones connected the very first page with the very last, and it is marvelous to think how the author could have built and carried all the structure in his brain, as he must have done, before he put it on paper.”

There is some exaggeration here. Tom Jones is fashioned on the model of the Spanish picaresque novels and of Gil Blas, and the simple structure depends on the nature of the genre: the hero for one reason or another leaves his home, has a variety of adventures on his travels, mixes with all sorts and conditions of men, has his ups and downs of fortune, and in the end achieves prosperity and marries a charming wife. Fielding, following his models, interrupted his narrative with stories that had nothing to do with it. This was an unhappy device that authors adopted not only, I think, for the reason I give in my first chapter, because they had to furnish a certain amount of matter to the bookseller and a story or two served to fill up; but partly, also, because they feared that a long string of adventures would prove tedious, and felt it would give the reader a fillip if they provided him here and there with a tale; and partly because if they were minded to write a short story, there was no other way to put it before the public. The critics chid, but the practice died hard, and, as we know, Dickens resorted to it in The Pickwick Papers. The reader of Tom Jones can without loss skip the story of The Man of the Hill and Mrs. Fitzherbert's narrative. Nor is Thackeray quite accurate in saying that there is not an incident that does not advance the story and grow out of former incidents. Tom Jones's encounter with the gipsies leads to nothing; and the introduction of Mrs. Hunt, and her proposal of marriage to Tom, is very unnecessary. The incident of the hundred-pound bill has no use and is, besides, grossly, fantastically improbable. Thackeray marvelled that Fielding could have carried all the structure in his brain before he began to put it on paper. I don’t believe that he did anything of the sort, any more than Thackeray did before he began to write Vanity Fair. I think it much more probable that, with the main lines of his novel in his mind, Fielding invented the incidents as he went along. For the most part they are happily devised. Fielding was as little concerned with probability as the picaresque novelists who wrote before him, and the most unlikely events occur, the most outrageous coincidences bring people together; yet he bustles you along with such gusto that you have hardly time, and in any case little inclination, to protest. The characters are painted in primary colours with a slap-dash bravura, and if they somewhat lack subtlety, they make up for it by animation. They are sharply individualized, and if they are drawn with some exaggeration, that was the fashion of the day, and perhaps their exaggeration is no greater than comedy allows. I am afraid Mr. Allworthy is a little too good to be true, but here Fielding failed, as every novelist since has failed who has attempted to depict a perfectly virtuous man. Experience seems to show that it is impossible not to make him a trifle stupid. One is impatient with a character who is so good that he lets himself be imposed upon by all and sundry. Mr. Allworthy is said to have been a portrait of Ralph Allen of Prior Park. If this is so, and the portrait is accurate, it only shows that a character taken straight from life is never quite convincing in a piece offiction.

Blifil, on the other hand, has been thought too bad to be true. Fielding hated deceit and hypocrisy, and his detestation of Blifil was such that it may be he laid on his colours with too heavy a hand; but Blifil, a mean, sneaking, self-seeking, cold-blooded fish, is not an uncommon type. The fear of being found out is the only thing that keeps him from being an utter scoundrel. But I think we should have believed more in Blifil if he had not been so transparent. He is repellent. He is not alive, as Uriah Heep is alive, and I have asked myself whether Fielding did not deliberately underwrite him from an instinctive feeling that if he gave him a more active and prominent role, he would make him so powerful and sinister a figure as to overshadow his hero.

On its appearance, Tom Jones was an immediate success with the public, but the critics were on the whole severe. Some of the objections were rather touchingly absurd: Lady Luxborough, for instance, complained that the characters were too like the persons“one meets with in the world.”It was on its supposed immorality, however, that the novel was generally condemned. Hannah More in her memoirs relates that she never saw Dr. Johnson angry with her but once, and that was when she alluded to some witty passage in Tom Jones.“I am shocked to hear you quote from so vicious a book, ”he said.“I am sorry to hear you have read it: a confession which no modest lady should ever make. I scarcely know a more corrupt work.”Now, I should say that a modest lady would do very well to read the book before marriage. It will tell her pretty well all she needs to know about the facts of life, and a lot about men which cannot fail to be useful to her before entering upon that difficult state. But no one has ever looked upon Dr. Johnson as devoid of prejudice. He would allow no literary merit to Fielding, and once described him as a blockhead. When Boswell demurred, he said: “What I mean by his being a blockhead is that he was a barren rascal.”“Will you not allow, Sir, that he draws very natural pictures of human life?”answered Boswell.“Why, Sir, it is of very low life. Richardson used to say that had he not known who Fielding was he should have believed that he was an ostler.”We are used to low life in fiction now, and there is nothing in Tom Jones that the novelists of our own day have not made us familiar with. Dr. Johnson might have remembered that in Sophia Western Fielding drew a charming and tender portrait of as delightful a young woman as ever enchanted a reader of fiction. She is simple but not silly, virtuous but no prude; she has character, determination and courage; she has a loving heart and she is beautiful. Lady Mary Wortley-Montagu, who very properly thought that Tom Jones was Fielding's masterpiece, regretted that he did not perceive that he had made his hero a scoundrel. I suppose that she referred to the incident that has been looked upon as the most reprehensible in the career of Mr. Jones. Lady Bellaston took a fancy to him, and found him not unprepared to gratify her desires, for he regarded it as a part of good breeding to behave with“gallantry”with a woman who showed an inclination for sexual commerce; he hadn’t a penny in his pocket, not even a shilling in his pocket to pay for a chair to convey him to her abode, and Lady Bellaston was rich. With a generosity unusual with women, who are apt to be lavish with the money of others, but careful with their own, she handsomely relieved his necessities. Well, it is doubtless not a pretty thing for a man to accept money from a woman; it is also an unprofitable one, because rich ladies in these circumstances demand much more than their money's worth; but morally it is no more shocking than for a woman to accept money from a man, and it is only foolishness on the part of common opinion to regard it as such. Our own day has found it necessary to invent a term, gigolo, to describe the male who turns his personal attractiveness into a source of profit; so Tom's lack of delicacy, however reprehensible, can hardly be regarded as unique. I have no doubt that the gigolo flourished as hardily under the reign of George the Second as he did under that of George the Fifth. It was characteristic, and to Tom Jones's credit, that on the very day on which Lady Bellaston had given him fifty pounds for passing the night with her, he was so moved by a hard-luck story, which his landlady told him about some relations of hers, that he handed her his purse and told her to take what she thought needful to relieve their distress. Tom Jones was honestly, sincerely and deeply in love with the charming Sophia, and yet felt no qualms about indulging in the pleasures of the flesh with any woman who was attractive and facile. He loved Sophia none the less for these episodes. Fielding was much too sensible to make his hero more continent than the normal man. He knew we should all be more virtuous if we were as prudent at night as we are in the morning. Nor was Sophia unreasonably vexed when she heard of these adventures. That in this particular she showed common sense unusual to her sex is surely one of the most engaging of her traits. It was well said by Austin Dobson, though with no elegance of style, that Fielding“made no pretence to produce models of perfection, but pictures of ordinary humanity, rather perhaps in the rough than in the polished, the natural than the artificial, his desire is to do this with absolute truthfulness, neither extenuating nor disguising defects and shortcomings.”That is what the realist strives to do and, throughout history, he has always been more or less violently attacked for it. For this the two main reasons, so far as I know, are as follows: there is a vast number of people, especially among the elderly, the well-to-do, the privileged, who take up the attitude: “Of course we know that there is a lot of crime and immorality in the world, poverty and unhappiness, but we don’t want to read about it. Why should we make ourselves uncomfortable? It is not as though we could do anything about it. After all, there always have been rich and poor in the world.”Another sort of people have other reasons for condemning the realist. They admit that there are vice and wickedness in the world, cruelty and oppression; but, they ask, is this proper matter for fiction? Is it well that the young should read about things which their elders know, but deplore, and may they not be corrupted by reading stories which are suggestive if not actually obscene? Surely fiction is better employed in showing how much beauty, kindness, self-sacrifice, generosity and heroism there is in the world. The answer the realist makes is that he is interested in telling the truth, as he sees it, about the world he has come in contact with. He does not believe in the unalloyed goodness of human beings; he thinks them a mixture of good and bad; and he is tolerant to idiosyncrasies of human nature which conventional morality reprobates, but which he accepts as human, natural, and therefore to be palliated. He hopes that he depicts the good in his characters as faithfully as the bad in them, and it is not his fault if his readers are more interested in their vices than in their virtues. That is a curious trait in the human animal for which he cannot be held responsible. If, however, he is honest with himself, he will admit that vice can be painted in colours that glow, whereas virtue seems to bear a hue that is somewhat dun. If you asked him how he could defend himself against the charge of corrupting the young, he would answer that it is very well for the young to learn what sort of a world it is that they will have to cope with. The result may be disastrous if they expect too much. If the realist can teach them to expect little from others; to realize from the beginning that each one's main interest is in himself; if he can teach them that, in some way or other, they will have to pay for everything they get, be it place, fortune, honour, love, reputation; and that a great part of wisdom is not to pay for anything more than it is worth, he will have done more than all the pedagogues and preachers to enable them to make the best of this difficult business of living. He will add, however, that he is not a pedagogue or a preacher, but, he hopes, an artist.





Jane Austen and Pride and Prejudice


1


The events of Jane Austen's life can be told very briefly. The Austens were an old family whose fortunes, like those of many of the greatest families in England, had been founded on the wool trade, which was at one time the country's staple industry; and having made money, again like others of greater importance, they had bought land and so, in course of time, joined the ranks of the landed gentry. But the branch of the family to which Jane Austen belonged seems to have inherited very little of such wealth as its other members possessed. It had come down in the world. Jane's father, George Austen, was the son of William Austen, a surgeon of Tonbridge, a profession which at the beginning of the eighteenth century was regarded no more highly than the attorney's; and, as we know from Persuasion, even in Jane Austen's day, an attorney was a person of no social consequence. It shocks Lady Russell, “the widow only of a knight, ”that Miss Elliot, the daughter of a baronet, should have social relations with Mrs. Clay, daughter of an attorney, “who ought to have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility.”William Austen, the surgeon, died early, and his brother, Francis Austen, sent the orphaned boy to Tonbridge School and afterwards to St. John's College, Oxford. These facts I learn from Dr. Chapman's Clark Lectures, which he has published under the title Jane Austen: Facts and Problems. For all that follows I am indebted to this admirable book.

George Austen became a fellow of his college and, on taking orders, was presented with the living of Steventon, in Hampshire, by a kinsman, Thomas Knight of Godmersham. Two years later, George Austen's uncle bought him the near-by living of Deane. Since we are told nothing of this generous man, we may surmise that, like Mr. Gardner in Pride and Prejudice, he was in trade.

The Rev. George Austen married Cassandra Leigh, the daughter of Thomas Leigh, a Fellow of All Souls and incumbent of the living of Harpsden near Henley. She was what was known in my youth as well-connected; that is to say, like the Hares of Hurstmonceaux, she was distantly related to members of the landed gentry and the aristocracy. It was a step up for the surgeon's son. Eight children were born of the marriage, two daughters, Cassandra and Jane, and six sons. To add to his income, the rector of Steventon took pupils, and his sons were educated at home. Two went to St. John's College, Oxford, because through their mother they were Founder's kin; of one, George by name, nothing is known, and Dr. Chapman suggests that he was deaf and dumb; two others entered the Navy and had careers of distinction: the lucky one was Edward, who was adopted by Thomas Knight and inherited his estates in Kent and Hampshire.

Jane, Mrs. Austen's younger daughter, was born in 1775. When she was twenty-six, her father resigned his living in favour of his eldest son, who had taken orders, and moved to Bath. He died in 1805, and some months later his widow and daughters settled in Southampton. It was while there that, after paying a call with her mother, Jane wrote to her sister Cassandra: “We found only Mrs. Lance at home, and whether she boasts any offspring besides a grand pianoforte did not appear…They live in a handsome style and are rich, and she seems to like to be rich; we gave her to understand that we were far from being so; she will soon feel that we are not worth her acquaintance.”Mrs. Austen was indeed left badly off, but her sons added enough to her income to enable her to live in tolerable comfort. Edward, after making the Grand Tour, married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Brook Bridges, Bart. of Goodnestone; and three years after Thomas Knight's death in 1794, his widow made over to him Godmersham and Chawton and retired to Canterbury with an annuity. A good many years later, Edward offered his mother a house on either of his estates; she chose Chawton; and there, with occasional visits, sometimes lasting for many weeks, to friends and relations, Jane lived till illness obliged her to go to Winchester in order to put herself in the hands of better doctors than could be found in the country. At Winchester in 1817 she died. She was buried in the Cathedral.

Jane Austen is said to have been in person very attractive: “Her figure was rather tall and slender, her step light and firm, and her whole appearance expressive of health and animation. In complexion she was a clear brunette with a rich colour; she had full round cheeks with mouth and nose small and well-formed, bright hazel eyes, and brown hair forming natural curls close round her face.”The only portrait of her I have seen shows a fat-faced young woman with undistinguished features, large round eyes and an obtrusive bust; but it may be that the artist did her less than justice.

Jane was greatly attached to her sister. As girls and women they were very much together and, indeed, shared the same bedroom till Jane's death. When Cassandra was sent to school, Jane went with her because, though too young to profit by such instruction as the seminary for young ladies provided, she would have been wretched without her.“If Cassandra were going to have her head cut off, ”said her mother, “Jane would insist on sharing her fate.”“Cassandra was handsomer than Jane, of a colder and calmer disposition, less demonstrative and of a less sunny nature; but she had the merit of always having her temper under command, but Jane had the happiness of a temper that never required to be commanded.”Most of Jane's letters that have remained were written to Cassandra when one or other of the sisters was staying away. Many of her warmest admirers have found them paltry, and have thought they showed that she was cold and unfeeling and that her interests were trivial. I am surprised. They are very natural. Jane Austen never imagined that anyone but Cassandra would read them, and she told her just the sort of things that she knew would interest her. She told her what people were wearing, and how much she had paid for the flowered muslin she had bought, what acquaintances she had made, what old friends she had met and what gossip she had heard.

Of late years, several collections of letters by eminent authors have been published, and for my part, when I read them, I am now and then disposed to suspect that the writers had at the back of their minds the notion that one day they might find their way into print. And when I learn that they had kept copies of their letters, the suspicion is changed into certainty. When André Gide wished to publish his correspondence with Claudel, and Claudel, who perhaps didn’t wish it to be published, told him that Gide's letters had been destroyed, Gide answered that it was no matter as he had kept copies of them. André Gide has told us himself that when he discovered that his wife had burned his love letters to her, he cried for a week, since he had looked upon them as the summit of his literary achievement and his chief claim on the attention of posterity. Whenever Dickens went on a journey, he wrote long letters to his friends in which he described eloquently the sights he had seen; and which, as John Forster, his first biographer, justly observes, might well have been printed without the alteration of a single word. People were more patient in those days; still, one would have thought it a disappointment to receive a letter from your friend, who gave you word pictures of mountains and monuments when you would have been glad to know whether he had run across anyone of interest, what parties he had been to and whether he had been able to get you the books, neck-cloths or handkerchiefs you had asked him to bring home.

In one of her letters to Cassandra, Jane said: “I have now attained the true art of letter-writing, which we are always told is to express on paper exactly what one would say to the same person by word of mouth. I have been talking to you almost as fast as I could the whole of this letter.”Of course she was quite right; that is the art of letter-writing. She attained it with consummate ease, and since she says that her conversation was exactly like her letters, and her letters are full of witty, ironical and malicious remarks, we may be pretty sure that her conversation was delightful. She hardly ever wrote a letter that had not a smile or a laugh in it, and for the delectation of the reader I will give some examples of her manner:

Single women have a dreadful propensity for being poor, which is one very strong argument in favour of matrimony.

Only think of Mrs. Holder being dead! Poor woman, she has done the only thing in the world she could possibly do to make one cease to abuse her.

Mrs. Hale, of Sherborne, was brought to bed yesterday of a dead child, some weeks before she expected, owing to a fright. I suppose she happened unawares to look at her husband.

The death of Mrs. W. K. we had seen. I had no idea that anybody liked her, and therefore felt nothing for any survivor, but I am now feeling away on her husband's account and think he had better marry Miss Sharpe.

I respect Mrs. Chamberlayne for doing her hair well, but cannot feel a more tender sentiment. Miss Langley is like any other short girl with a broad nose and wide mouth, fashionable dress and exposed bosom. Admiral Stanhope is a gentlemanlike man, but then his legs are too short and his tail too long.

Eliza has seen Lord Craven at Barton, and probably by this time at Kentbury, where he was expected for one day this week. She found his manners very pleasing indeed. The little flaw of having a mistress now living with him at Ashdown Park seems to be the only unpleasing circumstance about him.

Mr. W. is about five or six and twenty, not ill-looking and not agreeable. He is certainly no addition. A sort of cool, gentlemanlike manner, but very silent. They say his name is Henry, a proof how unequally the gifts of fortune are bestowed. I have seen many a John and Thomas much more agreeable.

Mrs. Richard Harvey is going to be married, but as it is a great secret, and only known to half the neighbourhood, you must not mention it.

Dr. Hale is in such very deep mourning that either his mother, his wife or himself must be dead.

Miss Austen was fond of dancing and she gave Cassandra an account of the balls she went to:

There were only twelve dances, of which I danced nine, and was merely prevented from dancing the rest by want of a partner.

There was one gentleman, an officer of the Cheshire, a very good-looking young man, who, I was told, wanted very much to be introduced to me; but as he did not want it quite enough to take much trouble in effecting it, we never could bring it about.

There were few beauties, and such as there were, were not very handsome. Miss Iremonger did not look well and Mrs. Blunt was the only one much admired. She appeared exactly as she did in September, with the same broad face, diamond bandeau, white shoes, pink husband and fat neck.

Charles Powlett gave a dance on Thursday to the great disturbance of all his neighbours, of course, who you know take a most lively interest in the state of his finances, and live in hopes of his being soon ruined. His wife is discovered to be everything that the neighbourhood would wish her to be, silly and cross as well as extravagant.

A relation of the Austens seems to have given occasion to gossip owing to the behaviour of a certain Dr. Mant, behaviour such that his wife retired to her mother's, whereupon Jane wrote: “But as Dr. M. is a clergyman their attachment, however immoral, has a decorous air.”

Miss Austen had a sharp tongue and a prodigious sense of humour. She liked to laugh, and she liked to make others laugh. It is asking too much of the humorist to expect him—or her—to keep a good thing to himself when he thinks of it. And, heaven knows, it is hard to be funny without being sometimes a little malicious. There is not much kick in the milk of human kindness. Jane had a keen appreciation of the absurdity of others, their pretensions, their affectations and their insincerities; and it is to her credit that they amused rather than annoyed her. She was too amiable to say things to people that would pain them, but she certainly saw no harm in amusing herself at their expense with Cassandra. I see no ill nature even in the most biting of her remarks; her humour was based, as humour should be, on observation and mother-wit. But when there was occasion for it, Miss Austen could be serious. Though Edward Austen inherited from Thomas Knight estates in Kent and in Hampshire, he lived for the most part at Godmersham Park, near Canterbury, and here Cassandra and Jane came in turn to stay, sometimes for as long as three months. His eldest daughter, Fanny, was Jane's favourite niece. She eventually married Sir Edward Knatchbull, whose son was raised to the peerage and assumed the title of Lord Brabourne. It was he who first published Jane Austen's letters. There are two which she wrote to Fanny, when that young person was considering how to cope with the attentions of a young man who wanted to marry her. They are admirable both for their cool sense and their tenderness.

It was a shock to Jane Austen's many admirers when, a few years ago, Mr. Peter Quennell published in The Cornhill a letter which Fanny, by this time Lady Knatchbull, many years later wrote to her younger sister, Mrs. Rice, in which she spoke of her famous aunt. It is so surprising, but so characteristic of the period that, having received permission from the late Lord Brabourne to do so, I here reprint it. The italics mark the words the writer underlined. Since Edward Austen in 1812 changed his name to Knight, it may be worth while to point out that the Mrs. Knight Lady Knatchbull refers to is the widow of Thomas Knight. From the way the letter begins, it is evident that Mrs. Rice was uneasy about some things she had heard that reflected on her Aunt Jane's gentility, and had written to enquire whether they were by any frightful chance true. Lady Knatchbull replied as follows:

Yes my love it is very true that Aunt Jane from various circumstances was not so refined as she ought to have been from her talent, and if she had lived fifty years later she would have been in many respects more suitable to our more refined tastes. They were not rich＆the people around with whom they chiefly mixed, were not at all high bred, or in short anything more than mediocre＆they of course tho’ superior in mental powers＆cultivation were on the same level as far as refinement goes—but I think in later life their intercourse with Mrs. Knight (who was very fond＆kind to them) improved them both＆Aunt Jane was too clever not to put aside all possible signs of“commonness”(if such an expression is allowable)＆teach herself to be more refined at least in intercourse with people in general. Both the aunts (Cassandra and Jane) were brought up in the most complete ignorance of the World＆its ways (I mean as to fashion etc.)＆if it had not been for Papa's marriage which brought them into Kent, ＆the kindness of Mrs. Knight, who used often to have one or other of the sisters staying with her, they would have been, tho’ not less clever and agreeable in themselves, very much below par as to good society and its ways. If you hate all this I beg yr’ pardon, but I felt it at my pen's end＆it chose to come along＆speak the truth. It is now nearly dressing time…

…I am ever beloved Sister yours most affec.

F.C.K.

This letter has excited the indignation of Jane's devotees, and they have claimed that Lady Knatchbull was senile when she wrote it. There is nothing in the letter to suggest that; nor, surely, would Mrs. Rice have written to make the enquiry had she thought her sister in no condition to answer it. It has seemed to the devotees dreadfully ungrateful that Fanny, whom Jane doted on, should have expressed herself in such terms. There they show themselves ingenuous. It is regrettable, but it is a fact, that children do not look upon their parents, or their relations belonging to another generation, with the same degree of affection as their parents, or relations, look upon them. Parents and relations are very unwise to expect it. Jane, as we know, never married, and she gave Fanny something of the mother-love she would, had she married, have bestowed on her own children. She was fond of children, and was a favourite with them; they liked her playful ways and the long circumstantial stories she told them. She and Fanny became fast friends. Fanny could talk to her in a way that perhaps she couldn’t with her father, occupied with the pursuits of the country squire that he had become, or with her mother, who was continuously giving birth to offspring. But children have sharp eyes, and are apt to judge cruelly. When Edward Austen inherited Godmersham and Chawton, he rose in the world, and his marriage allied him with the best families of the County. We know nothing of what Jane and Cassandra thought of his wife. Dr. Chapman tolerantly suggests that it was her loss which made Edward feel“that he ought to do more for his mother and sisters, and induced him to offer them a cottage on one or other of his estates.”He had been in possession of them for twelve years. It seems to me more likely that his wife thought they did enough for the members of his family if they were asked at intervals to pay them visits, and did not welcome the notion of having them permanently settled on her doorstep; and it was her death that freed him to do what he liked with his own property. If this were so, it cannot have escaped Jane's sharp eyes, and may well have suggested those passages in Sense and Sensibility in which she describes John Dashwood's treatment of his stepmother and her daughters. Jane and Cassandra were poor relations. If they were asked to spend long periods with their rich brother and his wife, with Mrs. Knight at Canterbury, with Lady Bridges, Elizabeth Knight's mother, at Goodnestone, it was a kindness of which their hosts were not improbably conscious. Few of us are so well constituted that we can do others a good turn without taking some credit to ourselves. When Jane went to stay with the elder Mrs. Knight, she always gave her a“tip”at the end of her visit, which Jane accepted with alacrity, and in one of her letters to Cassandra she tells her that her brother Edward had given Fanny and her a present of five pounds. Quite a nice little present to give to a young daughter, kindly to give to a governess, but only patronizing to give to a sister.

I am sure that Mrs. Knight, Lady Bridges, Edward and his wife, were very kind to Jane, and liked her, as how could they fail to, but it is not unreasonable to suppose that they thought the two sisters not quite up to the mark. They were provincial. There was still in the eighteenth century a good deal of difference between the people who lived for at least part of the year in London and those who never left the country. The difference provided the writers of comedy with their most fruitful material. Bingley's sisters in Pride and Prejudice despised the Misses Bennet for their want of style, and Elizabeth Bennet on the other hand, had little patience for what she considered their affectations. The Misses Bennet were a step higher in the social scale than the Misses Austen, because Mr. Bennet was a landed proprietor, though not a rich one, whereas the Rev. George Austen was a poor country parson.

It would not be strange if, with her upbringing, Jane was a trifle wanting in the elegances valued by the ladies of Kent; and if that were so, and it had escaped the sharp eyes of Fanny, we may be sure that her mother would have remarked on it. Jane was frank and outspoken, and I daresay often indulged in a blunt humour which those humourless females failed to appreciate. We can imagine their embarrassment if she said to them what she wrote to Cassandra, that she had a good eye for an adulteress. She was born in 1775. That is only twenty-five years after the publication of Tom Jones, and there is no reason to suppose that in the interval the manners of the country had greatly changed. Jane's may well have been such as Lady Knatchbull, fifty years later, considered, “below par as to good society and its ways.”When Jane went to stay with Mrs. Knight at Canterbury, it is probable, from what Lady Knatchbull says, that the elder lady gave her hints on behaviour which made her more“refined.”It may be on that account that in her novels she lays so much stress on good breeding. A novelist to-day, writing of the same class as she did, would take that for granted. For my part, I can see nothing to blame in Lady Knatchbull's letter. Her pen's end“chose to come along and speak the truth.”And what of it? It does not offend me in the least to guess that Jane spoke with a Hampshire accent, that her manners lacked a certain polish, and that her home-made dresses were in bad taste. We know, indeed, from Caroline Austen's Memoir, that the family were agreed that the sisters, notwithstanding their interest in clothes, did not dress well; but whether dowdily or unsuitably is not stated. The members of the family who have written about Jane Austen have been at pains to give it greater social consequence than in point of fact belonged to it. This was unnecessary. The Austens were nice, honest, worthy people, belonging to the fringe of the upper-middle class, and they were perhaps a little more conscious of their position than if it had been more assured. The sisters were at ease, as Lady Knatchbull observed, with the people with whom they chiefly consorted, and they, according to her, were not at all high-bred. When they were confronted with persons of somewhat higher station, like Bingley's sisters, women of fashion, they were apt to protect themselves by being critical. Of the Rev. George Austen we know nothing. His wife seems to have been a good, rather silly woman, who was constantly troubled with ailments which her daughters appear to have treated with kindness not unmingled with irony. She lived to hard upon ninety. The boys, till they went out into the world, presumably indulged in such sport as the country provided and, when they could borrow a horse, rode to hounds.

Austen-Leigh was Jane's first biographer. There is a passage in his book from which, by the exercise of a little imagination, we can get some idea of the sort of life she led during the long quiet years she spent in Hampshire.“It may be asserted as a general truth, ”he writes, “that less was left to the charge and discretion of servants, and more was done, or superintended by the masters and mistresses. With regard to the mistresses, it is, I believe, generally understood that…they took a personal part in the higher branches of cookery, as well as in the concoction of home-made wines, and distilling of herbs for domestic medicine…Ladies did not disdain to spin thread out of which the household linen was woven. Some ladies liked to wash with their own hands their choice china after breakfast and tea.”From the letters one gathers that sometimes the Austens were without a servant at all, and at others had to make do with a slip of a girl who knew nothing. Cassandra did the cooking, not because ladies“left less to the charge and discretion of servants, ”but because there was no servant to do it. The Austens were neither poor nor rich. Mrs. Austen and her daughters made most of their own clothes, and the girls made their brothers’ shirts. They made their mead at home, and Mrs. Austen cured the household hams. Pleasures were simple and the great excitement was a ball given by one of the more affluent neighbours. There were in England, in that long-past time, hundreds of families who lived such quiet, humdrum and decent lives: is it not strange that one of them, without rhyme or reason, should have produced a greatly gifted novelist?

Jane was very human. In her youth she loved dancing and flirting and theatricals. She liked young men to be good-looking. She took a healthy interest in gowns, bonnets and scarves. She was a fine needlewoman, “both plain and ornamental, ”and this must have stood her in good stead when she was making over an old gown and using part of a discarded skirt to fashion a new cap. Her brother Henry in his Memoir says: “Jane Austen was successful in everything that she attempted with her fingers. None of us could throw spilikins in so perfect a circle, or take them off with so steady a hand. Her performances with cup and ball were marvellous. The one used at Chawton was an easy one, and she has been known to catch it on the point a hundred times in succession, till her hand was weary. She sometimes found a resource in that simple game, when unable, from weakness in her eyes, to read or write long together.”

It is a charming picture.

No one could describe Jane Austen as a blue-stocking, a type with which she had no sympathy, but it is plain that she was far from being an uncultivated woman. She was, in fact, as well instructed as any woman of her time and station. Dr. Chapman, the great authority on her novels, has made a list of the books she is known to have read. It is an imposing one. Of course she read novels, the novels of Fanny Burney, Miss Edgeworth and those of Mrs. Radcliffe (of The Mysteries of Udolpho); and she read novels translated from French and German (among others, Goethe's Sorrows of Werther); and whatever novels she could get from the circulating library at Bath or Southampton. But she was interested not only in fiction. She knew her Shakespeare well and, among the moderns, she read Scott and Byron, but her favourite poet seems to have been Cowper. It is natural that his cool, elegant and sensible verse should have appealed to her. She read Johnson and Boswell, and a good deal of history, besides miscellaneous literature of various kinds. She was fond of reading aloud, and is said to have had a pleasant voice.

She read sermons, and was particularly fond of Sherlock's, a divine born in the seventeenth century. That is not so surprising as at first sight appears. In my early youth I lived in a country vicarage, and in the study several shelves were closely packed with handsomely-bound collections of sermons. If they were published, it was presumably because they sold; and if they sold, it was because people read them. Jane Austen was pious without being devout. Of course she went to church on Sundays, and partook of communion; and doubtless both at Steventon and Godmersham, family prayers were read morning and evening. But, as Dr. Chapman says: “It was admittedly not an age of religious ferment.”Just as we take a bath every day and wash our teeth morning and evening, and only feel at ease if we have done so; so, I should think, Miss Austen, like most others of her generation, having with proper unction performed her religious duties, put away the matters with which religion is concerned, as one puts away an article of clothing one does not for the moment want, and, for the rest of the day and week, gave her whole mind with an untroubled conscience to secular affairs.“The evangelists were not yet.”A gentleman's younger son was properly provided for by taking orders and being given a family living. It was unnecessary that he should have a vocation, but desirable that the house he was to live in should be commodious and the income adequate. But taking orders, it was only right that he should perform the duties of his profession. Jane Austen certainly believed that a clergyman should“live among his parishioners and prove himself by constant attention their well-wisher and friend.”That is what her brother Henry had done; he was witty and gay, the most brilliant of her brothers; he went into business and for some years greatly prospered; eventually, however, he went bankrupt. He then took orders, and was an exemplary parish priest.

Jane Austen shared the opinions common in her day and, so far as one can tell from her books and letters, was satisfied with the conditions that prevailed. She had no doubt that social distinctions were of importance, and she found it natural that there should be rich and poor. Young men, as was right and proper, obtained advancement in the service of the King by the influence of powerful friends. A woman's business was to marry, for love certainly, but in satisfactory conditions. This was in the order of things, and there is no sign that Miss Austen saw anything in it to object to. In one of her letters to Cassandra she remarks: “Carlo and his wife live in the most private manner imaginable at Portsmouth, without keeping a servant of any kind. What a prodigious amount of virtue she must have to marry under such circumstances.”The vulgar squalor in which Fanny Price's family lived, owing to her mother's imprudent marriage, was an object-lesson to show how careful a young woman should be.

Jane Austen's novels are pure entertainment. If you happen to believe that to entertain should be the novelist's main endeavour, you must put her in a class by herself. Greater novels than hers have been written, War and Peace, for example, and The Brothers Karamazov; but you must be fresh and alert to read them with profit. No matter if you are tired and dispirited, Jane Austen's enchant.

At the time she wrote, it was thought far from ladylike for a woman to do so. Monk Lewis observed: “I have an aversion, a pity and contempt for all female scribblers. The needle, not the pen, is the instrument they should handle, and the only one they ever use dexterously.”The novel was a form held in scant esteem, and Miss Austen was herself not a little perturbed that Sir Walter Scott, a poet, should write fiction. She was“careful that her occupation should not be suspected by servants, or visitors, or any person beyond her family party. She wrote upon small sheets of paper which could easily be put away, or covered with a piece of blotting paper. There was between the front door and the offices, a swing door which creaked when it was opened; but she objected to having this little inconvenience remedied, because it gave her notice when anyone was coming.”Her eldest brother, James never even told his son, then a boy at school, that the books he read with delight were by his Aunt Jane; and her brother Henry in his Memoir states: “No accumulation of fame would have induced her, had she lived, to affix her name to any productions of her pen, ”So her first book to be published, Sense and Sensibility was described on the title pages as“by a Lady.”

It was not the first she completed. That was a novel called First Impressions. Her father wrote to a publisher offering for publication, at the author's expense or otherwise, a“manuscript novel, comprising three volumes; about the length of Miss Burney's Evelina.”The offer was refused by return of post. First Impressions was begun during the winter of 1796 and finished in August 1797; it is generally supposed to have been substantially the same book as sixteen years later was issued as Pride and Prejudice. Then, in quick succession she wrote Sense and Sensibility and Northanger Abbey, but had no better luck with them, though after five years a Mr. Richard Crosby bought the latter, then called Susan, for ten pounds. He never published it, and eventually sold it back for what he had paid: since Miss Austen's novels were published anonymously, he had no notion that the book, with which he had parted for so small a sum, was by the successful and popular author of Pride and Prejudice. She seems to have written little but a fragment, The Watsons, between 1798, when she finished Northanger Abbey, and 1809. It is a long time for a writer of such creative power to remain silent, and it has been suggested that the cause was a love affair that occupied her to the exclusion of other interests. We are told that, when staying with her mother and sister at a seaside resort in Devonshire, “she became acquainted with a gentleman, whose charm of person, mind and manners was such that Cassandra thought him worthy to possess and likely to win her sister's love. When they parted he expressed his intention of soon seeing them again; and Cassandra felt no doubt as to his motives. But they never again met. Within a short time, they heard of his sudden death.”The acquaintance was short, and the author of the Memoir adds that he is unable to say“whether her feelings were of such a nature as to affect her happiness.”I do not for my part think they were. I do not believe that Miss Austen was capable of being very much in love. If she had been, she would surely have attributed to her heroines a greater warmth of emotion than in fact she did. There is no passion in their love. Their inclinations are tempered with prudence and controlled by common sense. Real love has no truck with these estimable qualities. Take Persuasion: Jane states that Anne Elliot and Wentworth fell deeply in love with one another. There, I think, she deceived herself and deceives her readers. On Wentworth's side it was certainly what Stendhal called amour passion, but on Anne's no more than what he called amour goût. They became engaged. Anne allows herself to be persuaded by that interfering snob, Lady Russell, that it would be imprudent to marry a poor man, a naval officer, who might be killed in the war. If she had been deeply in love with Wentworth, she would surely have taken the risk. It was not a very great one, for on her marriage she was to receive her share of her mother's fortune; this share amounted to rather more than three thousand pounds, equivalent now to over twelve thousand; so in any case she would not have been penniless. She might very well, like Captain Benwick and Miss Hargreaves, have remained engaged to Wentworth till he got his command and so was able to marry her. Anne Elliot broke off her engagement because Lady Russell persuaded her that she might make a better match if she waited, and it was not till no suitor, whom she was prepared to marry, presented himself that she discovered how much she loved Wentworth. We may be pretty sure that Jane Austen thought her behaviour natural and reasonable.

The most plausible explanation of her long silence is that she was discouraged by her inability to find a publisher. Her close relations, to whom she read her novels, were charmed by them, but she was as sensible as she was modest, and she may well have decided that their appeal was only to persons who were fond of her, and had, perhaps, a shrewd idea who the models of her characters were. The author of the Memoir rejects emphatically that she had such models, and Dr. Chapman seems to agree with him. They are claiming for Jane Austen a power of invention which is frankly incredible. All the greatest novelists, Stendhal and Balzac, Tolstoy and Turgenev, Dickens and Thackeray, have had models from whom they created their characters. It is true that Jane said: “I am too proud of my gentlemen to admit that they were only Mr. A, or Colonel B.”There the significant word is only. As with every other novelist, by the time her imagination had worked on the person who had suggested the character, he was to all intents and purposes her own creation; but that is not to say that he was not evolved from an original Mr. A. or Colonel B.

Be that as it may, in 1809, in which year Jane settled with her mother and sister in the quiet of Chawton, she set about revising her old manuscripts, and in 1811 Sense and Sensibility at last appeared. By then it was no longer outrageous for a woman to write. Professor Spurgeon, in a lecture on Jane Austen delivered to the Royal Society of Literature, quotes a preface to Original Letters from India by Eliza Fay. This lady had been urged to publish them in 1782, but public opinion was so averse“to female authorship”that she declined. But writing in 1816, she said: “Since then a considerable change has gradually taken place in public sentiment, and its development; we have now not only as in former days a number of women who do honour to their sex as literary characters, but many unpretending females, who fearless of the critical perils that once attended the voyage, venture to launch their little barks on the vast ocean through which amusement or instruction is conveyed to a reading public.”

Pride and Prejudice was published in 1813. Jane Austen sold the copyright for one hundred and ten pounds.

Besides the three novels already mentioned, she wrote three more, Mansfield Park, Emma and Persuasion. On these few books her fame rests, and her fame is secure. She had to wait a long time to get a book published, but she no sooner did than her charming gifts were recognized. Since then, the most eminent persons have agreed to praise her. I will only quote what Sir Walter Scott had to say; it is characteristically generous: “That young lady had a talent for describing the involvements, feelings and characters of ordinary life which is to me the most wonderful I have ever met with. The big bow-wow I can do myself like anyone going; but the exquisite touch which renders commonplace things and characters interesting from the truth of the description and the sentiment is denied to me.”

It is odd that Sir Walter should have omitted to make mention of the young lady's most precious talent: her observation was searching and her sentiment edifying, but it was her humour that gave point to her observation and a prim liveliness to her sentiment. Her range was narrow. She wrote very much the same sort of story in all her books, and there is no great variety in her characters. They are very much the same persons, seen from a somewhat different point of view. She had common sense in a high degree, and no one knew better than she her limitations. Her experience of life was confined to a small circle of provincial society, and that is what she was content to deal with. She wrote only of what she knew. As was first pointed out by Dr. Chapman, she never attempted to reproduce a conversation of men when by themselves, which in the nature of things she could never have heard.

It has been noticed that though she lived through some of the most stirring events of the world's history, the French Revolution, the Terror, the rise and fall of Napoleon, she made no reference to them in her novels. She has on this account been blamed for an undue detachment. It should be remembered that in her day it was not polite for women to occupy themselves with politics, that was a matter for men to deal with; few women even read the newspapers; but there is no reason to suppose that, because she did not write about these events, she was not affected by them. She was fond of her family, two of her brothers were in the Navy, often enough in danger, and her letters show that they were much on her mind. But did she not display her good sense in not writing about such matters? She was too modest to suppose that her novels would be read long after her death; but if that had been her aim, she could not have acted more wisely than she did in avoiding to deal with affairs which from the literary standpoint were of passing interest. Already, the novels concerned with the Second World War, that have been written in the last few years, are as dead as mutton. They were as ephemeral as the newspapers that day by day told us what was happening.

Most novelists have their ups and downs. Miss Austen is the only exception I know to prove the rule that only the mediocre maintain an equal level, a level of mediocrity. She is never more than a little below her best. Even in Sense and Sensibility and Northanger Abbey, in which there is much to cavil at, there is more to delight. Each of the others has its devoted, and even fanatic, admirers. Macaulay thought Mansfield Park her greatest achievement; other readers, equally illustrious, have preferred Emma; Disraeli read Pride and Prejudice seventeen times; to-day, many look upon Persuasion as her most finished work. The great mass of readers, I believe, has accepted Pride and Prejudice as her masterpiece, and in such a case I think it well to accept their judgment. What makes a classic is not that it is praised by critics, expounded by professors and studied in schools, but that large numbers of readers, generation after generation, have found pleasure and spiritual profit in reading it.

I myself think that Pride and Prejudice is on the whole the most satisfactory of all the novels. Its first sentence puts you in good humour: “It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.”It sets the note, and the good humour it induces remains with you till, with regret, you have reached the last page. Emma is the only one of Miss Austen's novels that I find long-winded. I can take no great interest in the love affair of Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax; and, though Miss Bates is immensely amusing, don’t we get a little too much of her? The heroine is a snob, and the way she patronizes those whom she looks upon as her social inferiors is repulsive. But we must not blame Miss Austen for that: we must remember that we of to-day do not read the same novel that was read by the readers of her day. Changes in manners and customs have wrought changes in our outlook; in some ways we are narrower than our forebears, in others more liberal; an attitude, which even a hundred years ago was general, now affects us with malaise. We judge the books we read by our own prepossessions and our own standards of behaviour. That is unfair, but inevitable. In Mansfield Park the hero and heroine, Fanny and Edmund, are intolerable prigs; and all my sympathies go out to the unscrupulous, sprightly and charming Henry and Mary Crawford. I cannot understand why Sir Thomas Bertram should have been enraged when, on his return from overseas, he found his family amusing themselves with private theatricals. Since Jane herself thoroughly enjoyed them, one cannot see why she found his anger justifiable. Persuasion has a rare charm, and though one may wish that Anne were a little less matter-of-fact, a little more disinterested, a little more impulsive—in fact a little less old-maidish—except for the incident on the Cobb at Lyme Regis, I should be forced to look upon it as the most perfect of the six. Jane Austen had no particular gift for inventing incident of an unusual character, and this one seems to me a very clumsy contrivance. Louisa Musgrove runs up some steep steps, and is“jumped down”by her admirer, Captain Wentworth. He misses her, she falls on her head and is stunned. If he were going to give her his hands, as we are told he had been in the habit of doing in“jumping her off”a stile, even if the Cobb then were twice as high as it is now, she could not have been more than six feet from the ground and, as she was jumping down, it is impossible that she should have fallen on her head. In any case, she would have fallen against the stalwart sailor and, though perhaps shaken and frightened, could hardly have hurt herself. Anyhow, she was unconscious, and the fuss that ensued is unbelievable. Captain Wentworth, who has seen action and made a fortune from prize-money, is paralyzed with horror. The immediately subsequent behaviour of all concerned is so idiotic that I find it hard to believe that Miss Austen, who was able to take the illnesses and death of her friends and relations with quiet fortitude, did not look upon it as uncommonly foolish.

Professor Garrod, a learned and witty critic, has said that Jane Austen was incapable of writing a story, by which, he explains, he means a sequence of happenings, either romantic or uncommon. But that is not what Jane Austen had a talent for, and not what she tried to do. She had too much sense, and too sprightly a humour, to be romantic, and she was interested not in the uncommon, but in the common. She made it uncommon by the keenness of her observation, her irony and her playful wit. By a story most of us mean a connected and coherent narrative with a beginning, a middle and an end. Pride and Prejudice begins in the right place, with the arrival on the scene of the two young men whose love for Elizabeth Bennet and her sister Jane provide the novel with its plot, and it ends in the right place with their marriage. It is the traditional happy ending. This kind of ending has excited the scorn of the sophisticated, and of course it is true that many, perhaps most, marriages are not happy, and further, that marriage concludes nothing; it is merely an introduction to another order of experience. Many authors have in consequence started their novels with marriage and dealt with its outcome. It is their right. But there is something to be said for the simple people who look upon marriage as a satisfactory conclusion to a work of fiction. They do so because they have an instinctive feeling that, by mating, a man and a woman have fulfilled their biological function; the interest which it is natural to feel in the steps that have led to this consummation, the birth of love, the obstacles, the misunderstandings, the avowals, now yields to its result, their issue, which is the generation that will succeed them. To nature, each couple is but a link in a chain, and the only importance of the link is that another link may be added to it. This is the novelist's justification for the happy ending. In Pride and Prejudice, the reader's satisfaction is considerably enhanced by the knowledge that the bridegroom has a substantial income and will take his bride to a fine house, surrounded by a park, and furnished throughout with expensive and elegant furniture.

Pride and Prejudice is a very well-constructed book. The incidents follow one another naturally, and one's sense of probability is nowhere outraged. It is perhaps odd that Elizabeth and Jane should be well-bred and well-behaved, whereas their mother and their three younger sisters should be, as Lady Knatchbull put it, “very much below par as to good society and its ways”; but that this should be so was essential to the story. I have allowed myself to wonder that Miss Austen did not avoid this stumbling-block by making Elizabeth and Jane the daughters of a first marriage of Mr. Bennet and making the Mrs. Bennet of the novel his second wife and the mother of the three younger daughters. She liked Elizabeth best of all her heroines.“I must confess, ”she wrote, “that I think her as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print.”If, as some have thought, she was herself the original for her portrait of Elizabeth; and she has certainly given her her own gaiety, high spirit and courage, wit and readiness, good sense and right feeling; it is perhaps not rash to suppose that when she drew the placid, kindly and beautiful Jane Bennet she had in mind her sister Cassandra. Darcy has been generally regarded as a fearful cad. His first offence was his disinclination to dance with people he didn’t know, and didn’t want to know, at a public ball to which he had gone with a party. Not a very heinous one. It was unfortunate that Elizabeth should overhear the derogatory terms in which he spoke of her to Bingley, but he could not know that she was listening, and his excuse might have been that his friend was badgering him to do what he had no wish to. It is true that when Darcy proposes to Elizabeth it is with an unpardonable insolence, but pride, pride of birth and position, was the predominant trait of his character, and without it there would have been no story to tell. The manner of his proposal, moreover, gave Jane Austen opportunity for the most dramatic scene in the book; it is conceivable that, with the experience she gained later, she might have been able to indicate Darcy's feelings, very natural and comprehensible feelings, in such a way as to antagonize Elizabeth, without putting into his mouth speeches so outrageous as to shock the reader. There is, perhaps, some exaggeration in the drawing of Lady Catherine and Mr. Collins, but to my mind little more than comedy allows. Comedy sees life in a light more sparkling, but colder, than that of common day, and a touch of exaggeration, that is of farce, is often no disadvantage. A discreet admixture of farce, like a sprinkle of sugar on strawberries, may well make comedy more palatable. With regard to Lady Catherine, one must remember that in Miss Austen's day rank gave its possessors a sense of immense superiority over persons of inferior station; and they not only expected to be treated by them with the utmost deference, but were. In my own youth I knew great ladies whose sense of importance, though not quite so blatant, was not far removed from Lady Catherine's. And as for Mr. Collins, who has not known, even to-day, men with that combination of obsequiousness and pomposity? That they have learnt to screen it with a front of geniality only makes it more odious.

Jane Austen was not a great stylist, but she wrote plainly and without affection. I think the influence of Dr. Johnson may be discerned in the structure of her sentences. She is apt to use the word of Latin origin, rather than the homely English one. It gives her phrase a slight formality which is far from unpleasant; indeed, it often adds point to a witty remark, and a demure savour to a malicious one. Her dialogue is probably as natural as dialogue could then be. To us it may seem somewhat stilted. Jane Bennet, speaking of her lover's sisters, says: “They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects.”It may, of course, be that these were the very words she uttered; I think it unlikely. It is obviously not how a modern novelist would phrase the same remark. To set down on paper speech exactly as it is spoken is very tedious, and some arrangement of it is certainly necessary. It is only of late years, comparatively, that novelists, striving for verisimilitude, have been at pains to make their dialogue as colloquial as possible: I suspect that it was a convention of the past to cause persons of education to express themselves with a balance, and with a grammatical correctness, which cannot commonly have been at their command, and I presume readers accepted it as natural.

Allowing, then, for the slight formality of Miss Austen's dialogue, we must admit that she invariably made the person of her stories speak in character. I have only noticed one occasion upon which she slipped up: “Anne smiled and said, ‘My idea of good company, Mr. Elliot, is the company of clever, well-informed people, who have a great deal of conversation; that is what I call good company.’‘You are mistaken, ’ said he gently, ‘that is not good company that is the best.’”

Mr. Elliot had faults of character; but if he was capable of making so admirable a reply to Anne's remark, he must have had qualities with which his creator did not see fit to acquaint us. For my part, I am so charmed with it that I would have been content to see her marry him rather than the stodgy Captain Wentworth. It is true that Mr. Elliot had married a woman“of inferior station”for her money, and neglected her; and his treatment of Mrs. Smith was ungenerous; but, after all, we only have her side of the story, and it may be that, had we been given a chance to hear his, we should have found his conduct pardonable.

There is one merit which Miss Austen has, and which I have almost omitted to mention. She is wonderfully readable—more readable than some greater and more famous novelists. She deals, as Walter Scott said, with commonplace things, “the involvements, feelings and characters of ordinary life”; nothing very much happens in her books and yet, when you come to the bottom of a page, you eagerly turn it to learn what will happen next. Nothing very much does and again you eagerly turn the page. The novelist who has the power to achieve this has the most precious gift a novelist can possess.





Charles Dickens and David Copperfield


1


Charles Dickens, though far from tall, was graceful and of a pleasing appearance. A portrait of him, painted by Maclise when he was twenty-seven, is in the National Portrait Gallery. He is seated in a handsome chair at a writing-table, with a small, elegant hand resting lightly on a manuscript. He is grandly dressed, and wears a vast satin neck-cloth. His brown hair is curled, and falls well below the ears down each side of his face. His eyes are fine; and the thoughtful expression he wears is such as an admiring public might expect of a very successful young author. What the portrait does not show is the animation, the shining light, the activity of heart and mind, which those who came in contact with him saw in his countenance. He was always something of a dandy, and in his youth favoured velvet coats, gay waistcoats, coloured neck-cloths and white hats; but he never quite achieved the effect he sought: people were surprised and even shocked by his dress, which they described as both slip-shod and flashy.

His grandfather, William Dickens, began life as a footman, married a housemaid and eventually became steward at Crewe Hall, the seat of John Crewe, Member of Parliament for Chester. William Dickens had two sons, William and John; but the only one that concerns us is John, first because he was the father of England's greatest novelist, and secondly because he served as a model for his son's greatest creation, Mr. Micawber. William Dickens died, and his widow stayed on at Crewe Hall as housekeeper. After thirty-five years she was pensioned off, and, perhaps to be near her two sons, went to live in London. The Crewes educated her fatherless boys, and provided them with a means of livelihood. They got John a post in the Navy Pay Office. There he made friends with a fellow-clerk and presently married his sister, Elizabeth Barrow. From the beginning of his married life he appears to have been in financial trouble, and he was always ready to borrow money from anyone who was foolish enough to lend it. But he was kind-hearted and generous, no fool, industrious, though perhaps but fitfully; and he evidently had a taste for good wine, since the second time he was arrested for debt, it was at the suit of a wine-merchant. He is described in later life as an old buck who dressed well and was for ever fingering the large bunch of seals attached to his watch.

Charles, the first son, but second child, of John and Elizabeth Dickens, was born in 1812 at Portsea. Two years later his father was transferred to London, and three years after that to Chatham. There the little boy was put to school, and there he began to read. His father had collected a few books, Tom Jones, The Vicar of Wakefield, Gil Blas, Don Quixote, Roderick Random, Peregrine Pickle; Charles read and re-read them. His own novels show how great and persistent an influence they had on him.

In 1822 John Dickens, who by this time had five children, was moved back to London. Charles was left at Chatham to continue his schooling, and did not rejoin his family for some months. He found them settled in Camden Town on the outskirts of the city, in a house which he was later to describe as the home of the Micawbers. John Dickens, though earning a little more than three hundred pounds a year, which to-day would be equivalent to at least four times as much, was apparently in more than usually desperate straits, and it would seem that there was not enough money to send little Charles to school again. To the boy's disgust, he was put to minding the children, cleaning the boots, brushing the clothes and helping the maid Mrs. Dickens had brought with her from Chatham with the housework. In the intervals he roamed about Camden Town, “a desolate place surrounded byfields and ditches, ”and the neighbouring Somers Town and Kentish Town, and sometimes he was taken farther afield and got a glimpse of Soho and Limehouse.

Things grew so bad that Mrs. Dickens decided to open a school for the children of parents living in India; she borrowed money, presumably from her mother-in-law, and had handbills printed for distribution, which her own children were sent to push into letter-boxes in the neighbourhood. Naturally enough, no pupils were brought. Debts meanwhile grew more and more pressing. Charles was sent to pawn whatever articles they had on which cash could be raised; the books, the precious books which meant so much to him, were sold. Then James Lamert, vaguely related by marriage to Mrs. Dickens, offered Charles a job at six shillings a week in a blacking factory, of which he was part-owner. His parents thankfully accepted the offer, but it cut the boy to the quick that they should be so manifestly relieved to get him off their hands. He was twelve years old. Shortly afterwards, John Dickens was arrested for debt and taken to the Marshalsea; and there his wife, after pawning the little that was left to pawn, joined him with her children. The prison was filthy, insanitary and crowded, for not only was it occupied by the prisoners, but by the families they might, if they chose, bring with them; though whether they were allowed to do this to alleviate the hardships of prison life or because the unfortunate creatures had nowhere else to go, I do not know. If a debtor had money, loss of liberty was the worst of the inconveniences he had to endure, and this loss in some cases might be mitigated: particular prisoners were permitted, on observing certain conditions, to reside outside the prison walls. In the past, the warden was in the habit of practising outrageous extortion on the prisoners and often treated them with barbarous cruelty; but by the time John Dickens was consigned to jail, the worst abuses had been done away with, and he was able to make himself sufficiently comfortable. The faithful little maid lived out and came in daily to help with the children and prepare meals. He still had his salary of six pounds a week, but made no attempt to pay his debt; and it may be supposed that, content to be out of reach of his other creditors, he did not especially care to be released. He soon recovered his usual spirits. The other debtors“made him chairman of the committee by which they regulated the internal economy of the prison, ”and presently he was on cordial terms with everyone from the turnkeys to the meanest inmate. The biographers have been puzzled by the fact that John Dickens continued meanwhile to receive his wages. The only explanation appears to be that since government clerks were appointed by influence, such an accident as being imprisoned for debt was not considered so grave a matter as to call for the drastic step of cutting off a salary.

At the beginning of his father's imprisonment, Charles lodged in Camden Town; but since this was a long way from the blacking factory, which was at Hungerford Stairs, Charing Cross, John Dickens found him a room in Lant Street, Southwark, which was near the Marshalsea. He was then able to breakfast and sup with his family. The work he was put to do was not hard; it consisted in washing the bottles, labelling them and tying them up. In April, 1824, Mrs. William Dickens, the Crewes’ old housekeeper, died and left her savings to her two sons. John Dickens's debt was paid (by his brother), and he regained his freedom. He settled his family once more in Camden Town, and went back to work at the Navy Pay Office. Charles continued to wash bottles at the factory for a while, but then John Dickens quarrelled with James Lamert, “quarrelled by letter, ”wrote Charles later, “for I took the letter from my father to him which caused the explosion.”James Lamert told Charles that his father had insulted him, and that he must go.“With a relief so strange that it was like oppression, I went home.”His mother tried to smooth things down, so that Charles should retain his job and the weekly wage, seven shillings by then, which she still sorely needed; and for this he never forgave her.“I never afterwards forgot, I never shall forget, I never can forget that my mother was warm for my being sent back, ”he added. John Dickens, however, would not hear of it, and sent his son to a school, very grandly called the Wellington House Academy, in the Hampstead Road. He stayed there two and a half years.

It is difficult to make out how long the boy spent at the blacking factory: he was there early in February and was back with his family by June, so that at the outside he could not have been at the factory for more than four months. It appears, however, to have made a deep impression upon him, and he came to look upon the experience as so humiliating that he could not bear to speak of it. When John Forster, his intimate friend and first biographer, by chance hit upon some inkling of it, Dickens told him that he had touched upon a matter so painful that“even at the present hour, ”and this was twenty-five years later, “he could never lose the remembrance of it while he remembered anything.”

We are so used to hearing eminent politicians and captains of industry boast of having in their early youth washed dishes and sold newspapers, that it is hard for us to understand why Charles Dickens should have worked himself up into looking upon it as a great injury that his parents had done him when they sent him to the blacking factory, and a secret so shameful that it must be concealed. He was a merry, mischievous, alert boy, and already knew a good deal of the seamy side of life. From an early age he had seen to what a pass his father's improvidence reduced the family. They were poor people, and they lived as poor people. At Camden Town he was put to sweep and scrub; he was sent to pawn a coat or a trinket to buy food for dinner; and like any other boy, he must have played in the streets with boys of the same sort as himself. He went to work at an age when at the time it was usual for boys of his class to go to work, and at a fair wage. His six shillings a week, presently raised to seven, was worth at least twenty-five to thirty shillings to-day. For a short time he had to feed himself on that, but later, when he lodged near enough to the Marshalsea to have breakfast and supper with his family, he only had to pay for his dinner. The boys he worked with were friendly, and it is hard to see why he should have found it such a degradation to consort with them. He had from time to time been taken to see his grandmother in Oxford Street, and he could hardly have helped knowing that she had spent her life in“service.”It may be that John Dickens was a bit of a snob and made pretensions that had no basis, but a lad of twelve surely has little sense of social distinctions. One must suppose, further, that if Charles was sophisticated enough to think himself a cut above the other boys at the factory, he would be smart enough to understand how necessary his earnings were to his family. One would have expected it to be a source of pride to him that he was become a wage-earner.

As a result, one may presume, of Forster's discovery, Dickens wrote, and gave Forster the fragment of autobiography from which the details of this episode in his life have been made known to us. As his imagination went to work on his recollections, he was filled, I suspect, with pity for the little boy he had been; he gave him the pain, the disgust, the mortification which he thought he, famous, affluent, beloved, would have felt if he had been in the little boy's place. And seeing it all so vividly, his generous heart bled, his eyes were dim with tears, as he wrote of the poor lad's loneliness and his misery at being betrayed by those in whom he had put his trust. I do not think he consciously exaggerated; he couldn’t help exaggerating: his talent, his genius if you like, was based on exaggeration. It was by dwelling upon, and emphasizing, the comic elements in Mr. Micawber's character that he excited his readers’ laughter; and it was by intensifying the pathos of Little Nell's slow decline that he reduced them to tears. He would not have been the novelist he was, if he had failed to make his account of the four months he spent at the blacking factory as moving as he alone knew how to make it; and, as everyone knows, he used it again to harrowing effect in David Copperfield. For my part, I do not believe that the experience caused him anything like the suffering that in after years, when he was famous and respectable, a social as well as a public figure, he persuaded himself that it had; and I believe even less that, as biographers and critics have thought, it had a decisive effect on his life and work.

While still at the Marshalsea, John Dickens, fearing that as an insolvent debtor he would lose his job in the Navy Pay Office, solicited the head of his department to recommend him for a superannuation grant on the ground of his ill health; and eventually, in consideration of his twenty years’ service and six children, he was granted“on compassionate grounds, ”a pension of one hundred and forty pounds a year. This was little enough for such a man as John Dickens to support a family and he had to find some means of adding to his income. He had somehow acquired a knowledge of shorthand; and with the help of his brother-in-law, who had connections with the press, he got employment as a parliamentary reporter. Charles remained at school till, at fifteen, he went to work as an errand-boy in a lawyer's office. He does not seem to have considered this beneath his dignity. He had joined what we now call the white-collar class. A few weeks later, his father managed to get him engaged as a clerk in another lawyer's office at ten shillings a week, which in course of time rose to fifteen shillings. He found the life dull and, with the hope of bettering himself, studied shorthand—to such purpose that after eighteen months he was sufficiently competent to set up as a reporter in the Consistory Court of Doctors’ Commons. By the time he was twenty, he was qualified to report the debates in the House of Commons, and soon gained the reputation of being“the fastest and most accurate man in the Gallery.”

Meanwhile, he had fallen in love with Maria Beadnell, the pretty daughter of a bank clerk. They met first when Charles was seventeen. Maria was a flirtatious young person, and she seems to have given him a good deal of encouragement. There may even have been a secret engagement between them. She was flattered and amused to have a lover, but Charles was penniless, and she can never have intended to marry him. When after two years the affair came to an end, and in true romantic fashion they returned one another's presents and letters, Charles thought his heart would break. They did not meet again till many years later. Maria Beadnell, long a married woman, dined with the celebrated Mr. Dickens and his wife: she was fat, commonplace and stupid. She served then as the model for Flora Finching in Little Dorrit. She had already served as the model for Dora in David Copperfield.

In order to be near the paper for which he was working, Dickens had taken lodgings in one of the dingy streets off the Strand, but finding them unsatisfactory, he presently rented unfurnished rooms in Furnival's Inn. But before he could furnish these, his father was again arrested for debt, and he had to provide money for his keep at the sponging-house.“As it had to be assumed that John Dickens would not rejoin his family for some time, ”Charles took cheap lodgings for his family and camped out with his brother Frederick, whom he took to live with him, in the“three-pair back”at Furnival's Inn.“Just because he was open-hearted as well as open-handed, ”wrote the late Una Pope-Hennessy in her very readable biography of Charles Dickens, “and seemed able to deal with difficulties of the kind easily, it became the custom in his family, and later on in his wife's family, to expect him to find money and appointments for as spineless a set of people as ever breadwinner was saddled with.”

When he had been working for a year or so in the Gallery of the House of Commons, Dickens began to write a series of sketches of London life; the first were published in The Monthly Magazine, and later ones in The Morning Chronicle; he was paid nothing for them, but they attracted the attention of a publisher named Macrone, and on the author's twenty-fourth birthday they were issued in two volumes, with illustrations by Cruickshank, under the title Sketches by Boz. Macrone paid him one hundred and fifty pounds for the first edition. The book was well reviewed, and within a short time brought him an offer of further work. There was a vogue at the time for anecdotic novels of a humorous character, which were issued in monthly parts at a shilling, with comic illustrations. They were the remote ancestors of the funnies of our own time, and they had the same prodigious popularity. One day a partner in the firm of Chapman and Hall called upon Dickens to ask him to write a narrative about a club of amateur sportsmen to serve as a vehicle for the illustrations of a well-known artist. There were to be twenty numbers, and he offered fourteen pounds a month for what we should now call the serial rights, with further payments when later they were published as a book. Dickens protested that he knew nothing about sport and did not think he could write to order, but“the emolument was too tempting to resist.”I need hardly say that the result was The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club. The first five numbers had no great success, but with the introduction of Sam Weller the circulation leaped up. By the time the work appeared in book-form, Charles Dickens was famous. Though the critics made their reservations, his reputation was made. It is well to record that The Quarterly Review, speaking of him, said that“it required no gift of prophecy to foretell his fate—he has risen like a rocket and he will come down like a stick.”But indeed, throughout his career, while the public devoured his books, the critics carped.

A couple of days before the appearance of the first number of The Pickwick Papers, in 1836, Dickens married Kate, the eldest daughter of George Hogarth, a colleague of Dickens on The Morning Chronicle. George Hogarth was the father of six sons and eight daughters. The daughters were small, plump, fresh-coloured and blue-eyed. Kate was the only one of marriageable age. That seems to have been the reason why Dickens married her rather than one of the others. After a short honeymoon, they settled down in Furnival's Inn and invited Kate's pretty sister, Mary Hogarth, a girl of sixteen, to live with them. Dickens accepted a contract to write another novel, Oliver Twist, and he started it while still at work on The Pickwick Papers. This also was to appear in monthly numbers, and he devoted a fortnight to one and a fortnight to the other. Most novelists are so absorbed in the characters which are at the moment engaging their attention that, by no effort of will, they thrust back into their unconscious what other literary ideas they have had in mind; and that Dickens should have been able to switch, apparently with ease, from one story to another is an amazing feat.

He took a fancy to Mary Hogarth, and when Kate found herself with child and, could not go about with him, Mary became his constant companion. Kate's baby was born, and as she might be expected to have several more, a move was made from Furnival's Inn to a house in Doughty Street. Mary grew every day more lovely and more delightful. One May evening, Dickens took Kate and Mary to a play; they enjoyed themselves and came home in high spirits. Mary was taken ill. A doctor was sent for. In a few hours she was dead. Dickens took the ring from her finger and put it on his own. He wore it till his death. He was prostrated with grief. Not long after, he wrote in his diary: “If she were with us now, the same winning, happy, amiable companion, sympathizing with all my thoughts and feelings more than anyone I know ever did or will, I think I should have nothing to wish for but a continuance of such happiness. But she is gone, and pray God I may one day, through his mercy, rejoin her.”These are significant words, and they tell us a great deal. He arranged to be buried by Mary's side. I think there can be no doubt that he had fallen deeply in love with her. We shall never know whether he was aware of it.

At the time of Mary's death, Kate was once more pregnant, and the shock brought on a miscarriage. When she was well enough, Charles took her for a short trip abroad so that they might both recover their spirits. By the summer he, at all events, had sufficiently done so to have a boisterous flirtation with a certain Eleanor P.

With Oliver Twist, Nicholas Nickleby and The Old Curiosity Shop, Dickens was soundly launched on his triumphant career. He was a hard worker, and for several years started to write a new book long before he had finished with the old one. He wrote to please and kept his eye on the public reaction to the monthly numbers, in which many of his novels appeared, and it is interesting to learn that he had no intention of sending Martin Chuzzlewit to America till the declining sales showed that his numbers were not so attractive as usual. He was not the sort of author who looks upon popularity as something to be ashamed of. His success was enormous. But the life of a literary man, who has achieved it, is not as a rule eventful. It follows a uniform pattern. His profession obliges him to devote a certain number of hours a day to his work, and he discovers a routine to suit him. He is brought into contact with the celebrated people of the day, literary, artistic and polite. He is taken up by great ladies. He goes to parties and gives parties. He travels. He makes public appearances. This, broadly, was the pattern of Dickens's life. The success he enjoyed, indeed, was such as has been the fortune of few authors to experience. His energy seemed inexhaustible. Not only did he produce long novels in quick succession, he founded and edited magazines and, for a short period, even edited a daily paper; he wrote a quantity of occasional pieces; he delivered lectures, he spoke at banquets, and later gave readings of his works. He rode, he thought nothing of walking twenty miles a day, he danced and played the fool with gusto, he did conjuring tricks to amuse his children, he acted in amateur theatricals. He had always been fascinated by the theatre, and once had seriously thought of going on the stage; at that time, he took lessons in elocution from an actor, learned parts by heart and practised before a mirror how to enter a room, sit down on a chair and make a bow. One must suppose that these accomplishments were useful to him when he was introduced into the world of fashion. The censorious, notwithstanding, thought him faintly vulgar and his mode of dress showy. Accent in England has always“placed”a man, and it is likely enough that Dickens, who had lived almost all his life in London, and in very modest circumstances, had something of a cockney accent. But he charmed by his good looks, the brightness of his eyes, his exuberance, vivacity and joyous laugh. He may have been dazzled by the adulation of which he was the object, but his head was not turned. He retained an attractive modesty. He was a genial, delightful, affectionate creature. He was one of those persons who, when they come into a room, bring with them delight.

Oddly enough, though he had an immense power of observation and, in course of time, came to be on familiar terms with persons in the higher ranks of society, he never succeeded in his novels in making such characters as he created in those walks of life quite credible. One of the commonest charges against him, during his lifetime, was that he couldn’t draw a gentleman. His lawyers and lawyer's clerks, whom he had known when he worked in an office, have a distinctiveness of feature which is lacking in his doctors and parsons; he was at his best when dealing with the ragtag and bobtail among whom his boyhood was spent. It looks as though a novelist can only know intimately enough, to use them with profit as models for creatures of his own invention, the persons with whom he has been connected at an early age. A child's year, a boy's year, is much, much longer than the year of a grown-up man, and he is thus given what seems like all the time in the world to make himself aware of the idiosyncrasies of the people who form his environment.“One reason why many English writers have totally failed in describing the manners of upper life, ”wrote Henry Fielding, “may possibly be, that in reality they knew nothing of it.…Now it happens that this higher order of mortals is not to be seen, like all the rest of the human species, for nothing, in the streets, shops, and coffee houses: nor are they shown, like the upper ranks of animals, for so much a-piece. In short, this is a sight to which no persons are admitted without one or other of these qualifications, viz., either title or fortune, or, what is equivalent to both, the honourable profession of gamester. And, very unluckily for the world, persons so qualified very seldom care to take upon themselves the bad trade of writing; which is generally entered upon by the lower and poorer sort, as it is a trade which many think requires no kind of store to set up with.”

As soon as circumstances permitted, the Dickenses moved into a new house in a more fashionable quarter, and ordered from firms of repute complete suites for the reception rooms and bedrooms. Thick pile carpets were laid on the floors and festooned curtains adorned the windows. They engaged a good cook, three maids and a manservant. They set up a carriage. They gave dinner parties, to which noble and distinguished people came. The profusion somewhat shocked Jane Carlyle, and Lord Jeffrey wrote to his friend, Lord Cockburn, that he had dined in the new house and had“a rather too sumptuous dinner for a man with a family and only beginning to be rich.”It was part of the generosity of Dickens's spirit that he liked to surround himself with people and, after the meanness of his origins, it is only natural that it should have pleased him to be lavish. But it cost money. His father, and his father's family, his wife's family, were a constant drain on him. It was partly to meet his heavy expenses that he founded the first of his magazines, Master Humphrey's Clock, and to give it a good send-off published The Old Curiosity Shop in it.

In 1842, leaving the four children in the care of Georgina Hogarth, Kate's sister, but taking Kate with him, he went to America. He was lionized as no author has ever been before or since. But the trip was not a complete success. A hundred years ago, the people of the United States, though ready enough to disparage things European, were exceedingly sensitive of any criticism of themselves. A hundred years ago, the press of the United States was ruthless in its invasion of the privacy of any hapless person who was“news.”A hundred years ago, in the United States the publicity-minded looked upon the distinguished foreigner as a God-given opportunity to get into the limelight, and called him conceited and supercilious, when he showed a disinclination to be treated like a monkey in a zoo. A hundred years ago, the United States was a land where speech was free, so long as it did not offend the susceptibilities or affect the interests of other people, and where everyone was entitled to his own opinions, so long as they agreed with those of everyone else. Of all this Charles Dickens was ignorant, and he made bad blunders. The absence of an International Copyright not only deprived English authors of any profit in the United States from the sale of their books, but also damaged American authors, since the booksellers very naturally preferred to publish books by English authors, which they could get for nothing, rather than books by American authors for which they had to pay. But it was tactless of Dickens to introduce the subject in the speeches he made at the banquets given for him on his arrival. The reaction was violent, and the newspapers described him as“no gentleman, but a mercenary scoundrel.”Though he was mobbed by admirers, and at Philadelphia shook hands for two hours with the crowd who wanted to meet him, his rings and diamond pins, his gaudy waistcoats, excited a good deal of criticism, and there were some who found his behaviour far from well-bred. But he was natural and unpretending, and few in the end could resist his youth, comely looks and gaiety. He made some good friends, with whom he remained on affectionate terms till his death.

The Dickenses returned to England after four eventful, but exhausting, months. The children had grown attached to their Aunt Georgina, and the weary travellers asked her to make her home with them. She was sixteen, the age of Mary when she went to live at Furnival's Inn with the newly-married couple, and so like her that from a distance she might have been taken for her. The resemblance was so strong“that when she and Kate and I are sitting together, ”wrote Dickens, “I seem to think that what has happened is a melancholy dream from which I am just awakening.”Georgy was pretty, attractive and unassuming. She had a gift of mimicry by means of which she could make Dickens roar with laughter. In course of time, he came to depend more and more on her. They took long walks together, and he discussed his literary plans with her. He found her a useful and reliable amanuensis. The style of living Dickens had adopted was expensive, and soon he found himself uncomfortably in debt. He decided to let his house and take his family, including Georgy of course, to Italy, where living was cheap and he could retrench. He spent a year there, chiefly at Genoa, and though he did a good deal of sightseeing up and down the country, he was too insular, and his culture too tenuous, for the experience to have any spiritual effect on him. He remained the typical British tourist. But having discovered how pleasant (and economical) it was to live abroad, Dickens began to spend long periods on the Continent. Georgy, as one of the family, went with them. On one occasion, when they were going to settle in Paris for a considerable time, she went there alone with Charles to find an apartment, while Kate waited in England till they had made everything ready for her.

Kate was of a placid and melancholy disposition. She was not adaptable, and liked neither the journeys Charles took her on, the parties she went to with him, nor the parties at which she acted as hostess. She was clumsy, colourless and rather stupid, it would appear; and it is likely enough that the great and important persons, who were eager to enjoy the celebrated author's company, found it a nuisance to have to put up with his dull wife. Some of them, to her annoyance, persistently treated her as a cipher. It is not easy to be the wife of a distinguished man. She is unlikely to make a good job of it, unless she has tact and a lively sense of humour. In default of these, she must love her husband, and sufficiently admire him to find it natural that people should be more interested in him than in her. She must be clever enough to find solace in the fact that he loves her and, whatever his intellectual infidelities may be, in the end returns to her for comfort and reassurance. Kate does not appear ever to have been in love with Dickens. There is a letter he wrote to her during their engagement in which he reproaches her for her coldness. It may be that she married him because at that time marriage was the only occupation open to a woman, or it may be that, as the eldest of eight daughters, some pressure was put upon her by her parents to embrace an offer that provided for her future. She was a kindly, gentle little thing, but incapable of meeting the claims which her husband's eminence made on her. In fifteen years she gave birth to ten children, and had four miscarriages. During her pregnancies, Georgy accompanied Dickens on the jaunts he was fond of taking, went to parties with him, and increasingly presided at his table in Kate's place. One would have expected Kate to resent the situation: we do not know that she did.

The years passed. In 1857 Charles Dickens was forty-five. Of his nine surviving children, the elder ones were grown up, the youngest was five. His reputation was world-wide and he was the most popular author in England. He was influential. He lived, as greatly appealed to his theatrical instincts, in the public eye. Some years before, he had made the acquaintance of Wilkie Collins, and the acquaintance quickly ripened into a close friendship. Collins was twelve years younger than Dickens. Mr. Edgar Johnson thus writes of him: “He loved rich food, champagne and music halls; he was often involved in intricate tangles with several women at once; he was amusing, cynical, good-humoured, unrestrained to the point of vulgarity.”For Dickens, Wilkie Collins stood, again quoting Mr. Johnson, “for fun and freedom.”They travelled about England together and went to Paris to have a lark. It is likely enough that Dickens took the opportunity, as many a man in his place would do, to have a little flutter with any young person of easy virtue who was at hand. Kate had not given him all he expected, and for a long time he had been increasingly dissatisfied with her.“She is amiable and complying, ”he wrote, “but nothing on earth would make her understand me.”From early in their marriage she had been jealous of him. I suspect he found the scenes she made him easier to bear when he knew that she had no reason to be jealous, than later when she surely had. He persuaded himself then that she had never suited him. He had developed, but she had remained what she was at the beginning. Dickens was convinced that he had nothing to reproach himself with. He was assured that he had been a good father, and had done everything possible for his children. The fact is that, though none too pleased at having to provide for so many, for which he seems to have thought that Kate alone was to blame, he liked them well enough when they were small; but as they grew up, he somewhat lost interest in them, and at a suitable age packed the boys off to remote parts of the world. It is true that they were scarcely a promising lot.

But it is likely that, but for an unforeseen accident, nothing very much would have changed the relations between Dickens and his wife. Like many another uncongenial couple, they might have drifted apart, and yet to the world retained a semblance of unity. Dickens fell in love. He had, as I have said, a passion for the stage, and on more than one occasion had given amateur performances of one play or another for charitable purposes. At the time with which I am now dealing, he was asked to give some performances in Manchester of a play, The Frozen Deep, which Wilkie Collins had written with his help, and which had been performed at Devonshire House with great success before the Queen, the Prince Consort and the King of the Belgians. But when he agreed to repeat the play at Manchester, since he did not think his daughters, who had taken the girls’ parts before, would be heard in a big theatre, he decided that their parts should be acted by professionals. A young woman called Ellen Ternan was engaged for one of them. She was eighteen. She was small and fair, and her eyes were blue. The rehearsals took place in Dickens's house, and he directed the play. He was flattered by Ellen's adoring attitude and by her pathetic desire to please him. Before the rehearsals were over, he was in love with her. He gave her a bracelet, which by mistake was delivered to his wife, and she naturally made him a scene. Charles seems to have adopted the attitude of injured innocence which a husband, in such an awkward juncture, finds it most convenient to adopt. The play was produced, and he played the leading part, that of a self-sacrificing arctic explorer, with such pathos that there was not a dry eye in the house. He had grown a beard to play it.

The relations between Dickens and his wife grew more and more tense. He, who had always been so genial, so good-humoured, so easy to get on with, now was moody, restless and out of temper with everyone—but Georgy. He was very unhappy. At last he came to the conclusion that he could live with Kate no longer; but his position with the public was such that he was fearful of the scandal that an open break might cause. His anxiety is comprehensible. By his immensely profitable Christmas Books he had done more than anyone to make Christmas the symbolic festival to celebrate the domestic virtues, and the beauty of a united and happy family life. For years he had assured his readers in moving terms that there was no place like home. The situation was delicate. Various suggestions were made. One was that Kate should have her own suite of rooms apart from his, act as hostess at his parties and accompany him to public functions. Another was that she should stay in London while he was at Gad's Hill (a house in Kent Dickens had recently bought), and stay at Gad's Hill when he was in London. A third was that she should settle abroad. All these proposals she rejected, and finally a complete separation was decided on. Kate was installed in a little house on the edge of Camden Town with an income of six hundred a year. A little later, Dickens's eldest son, Charles, went to live with her for a period.

The arrangement is surprising. One cannot but wonder why, placid as she was and stupid as she may have been, Kate allowed herself to be driven from her own house, and why she consented to leave her children behind. She knew of Charles's infatuation with Ellen Ternan, and one would have supposed that, with this trump-card in her hand, she could have made what terms she chose. In one of his letters Dickens refers to a“weakness”of Kate's, and in another letter, unfortunately published at the time, he alludes to a mental disorder“which caused his wife to think that she would be better away.”It is generally believed that these were discreet references to the fact that Kate drank. It would not be strange if her jealousy, her sense of inadequacy, the mortification of feeling that she was not wanted, had driven her to the bottle. If she was become a confirmed alcoholic, it would explain why Georgy should have managed the house and looked after the children, why they should have remained at home when their mother left it, why Georgy could write that“Poor Kate's incapacity for looking after children was no secret to anyone.”It may be that her eldest son went to live with her to see that she did not tipple over much.

Dickens was far too celebrated for his private affairs not to give rise to gossip. Scandalous rumours were spread abroad. He heard that the Hogarths, Kate's and Georgy's mother and sister, were saying that Ellen Ternan was his mistress. He was furious and forced them, by threatening to turn Kate out of her house without a penny, to sign a declaration that they did not believe there was anything reprehensible in his relations with the little actress. The Hogarths took a fortnight before they could bring themselves to be thus blackmailed. They must have known that, if he carried out his threat, Kate could go to law with a cast-iron case; if they dared not let things go to such lengths, it can surely only have been because there were faults on Kate's side which they were unwilling to have divulged. There was also a good deal of talk about Georgy. She is, indeed, the enigmatic figure in the whole affair. I wonder that no one has been tempted to make her the central figure of a play. Earlier in this chapter I remarked on the significance of what Dickens wrote in his diary after Mary's death. This made it clear, it seemed to me, not only that he had been in love with her, but was already dissatisfied with Kate. And when Georgy came to live with them, he was charmed with her because of her astonishing resemblance to Mary. Did he then fall in love with her too? Did she love him? No one can tell. Georgy was jealous enough of Kate to cut out all sentences in praise of her when, after Charles's death, she edited a selection of his letters; but the attitude of Church and State towards marriage with a deceased wife's sister had given any connection of the sort an incestuous aspect, and it may never have entered her head that there could be more between herself and the man in whose house she had lived for fifteen years than the fond affection a sister might ligitimately feel for a brother by blood. Perhaps it was enough for her to be in the confidence of so famous a man, and to have established a complete ascendancy over him. The strangest part of it all is that when Charles fell passionately in love with Ellen Ternan, Georgy made a friend of her and welcomed her at Gad's Hill. Whatever she felt, she kept to herself.

The connection between Charles Dickens and Ellen Ternan was dealt with, by those in a position to know, so discreetly that the details are uncertain. It seems that she resisted his advances for some time, but in the end yielded to his insistence. It is believed that under the name of Charles Tringham he took a house for her at Peckham, and there she lived till his death. According to his daughter Katie, he had a son by her; since nothing more was heard of him it is presumed that he died in infancy. But Ellen's surrender, it is said, did not bring Dickens the radiant bliss he expected; he was more than twenty-five years older than she was, and he could not but have known that she was not in love with him. Few pains are harder to bear than those of an unrequited passion. He left her a thousand pounds in his will, and she married a parson. She told a clerical friend, a certain Canon Benham, that she“loathed the very thought of the intimacy”Dickens had forced upon her. Like many another member of the gentle sex, she seems to have been ready enough to accept the perquisites of her position, but saw no reason why she should be asked to give anything in return.

At about the time of the break with his wife, Dickens began to give readings of his work, and for this purpose travelled over the British Isles and again went to the United States. His histrionic gift served him well, and his success was spectacular. But the effort he exerted, and the constant journeys, wore him out, and people began to notice that, though still in his forties, he looked an old man. These readings were not his only activity: during the twelve years between the separation and his death he wrote three long novels and conducted an immensely popular magazine called All the Year Round. It is not surprising that his health failed. He began to suffer from tiresome ailments, and it was evident that the lectures were wearing him out. He was advised to give them up, but he wouldn’t; he loved the publicity, the excitement that attended his appearances, the face-to-face applause, the thrill of power that he felt as he swayed an audience to his will. And is it not just possible that he felt it might make Ellen fonder of him when she saw the adulation of the crowds that thronged his lectures? He decided to make a final tour, but was taken so ill in the middle of it that he had to abandon it. He went back to Gad's Hill and sat down to write The Mystery of Edwin Drood. But to make up to his managers for the readings he had had to cut short, he arranged to give twelve more in London. This was in January 1870.“The audiences at St. James's Hall were immense and sometimes they rose and cheered in a body as he entered and when he left.”Back at Gad's Hill, he resumed work on his novel. One day in June, while he was dining alone with Georgy, he was taken ill. She sent for the doctor, and for his two daughters who were in London, and next day the younger one, Katie, was despatched by her resourceful and competent aunt to break the news to his wife that he was dying. Katie returned to Gad's Hill with Ellen Ternan. He died the day after, June 9, 1870, and was buried in Westminster Abbey.

In a famous essay, Matthew Arnold insists that poetry to be truly excellent must have a high seriousness, and because he finds it lacking in Chaucer, refuses him, though praising him handsomely, a place among the greatest poets. Arnold was too austere not to look upon humour without a faint misgiving, and I don’t suppose he could ever have been brought to admit that there might be as high a seriousness in Rabelais’ laughter as in Milton's desire to justify the works of God to man. But I see his point, and it does not apply only to poetry. It may be that it is because this high seriousness is lacking in Dickens's novels that, for all their great merits, they leave us faintly dissatisfied. When we read them now with the great French and Russian novels in mind, and not only theirs, but George Eliot's, we are taken aback by their naiveté. In comparison with them, Dickens's are scarcely adult. But, of course, we must remember that we do not read the novels he wrote. We have changed, and they have changed with us. It is impossible for us to recapture the emotions with which his contemporaries read them, as they came hot from the press. In this connection, I will quote a passage from Una Pope-Hennessy's book: “Mrs. Henry Siddons, a neighbour and friend of Lord Jeffrey, peeped into his library and saw Jeffrey with his head on the table. He raised it with his eyes suffused with tears. She begged to be excused, saying, ‘I had no idea that you had any bad news or cause of grief or I would not have come. Is anyone dead?’‘Yes, indeed, ’ replied Lord Jeffrey.‘I’m a great goose to have given away so, but I could not help it. You’ll be sorry to hear that little Nelly, Boz's little Nelly is dead.’”Jeffrey was a Scottish judge, a founder of The Edinburgh Review and a severe, caustic critic.

For my part, Ifind myself still immensely amused by Dickens's humour, but his pathos leaves me cold. I am inclined to say that he had strong emotions, but no heart. I hasten to qualify that. He had a generous heart, a passionate sympathy with the poor and oppressed, and as we know, he took a persistent and effective interest in social reform. But it was an actor's heart, by which I mean that he could feel intensely an emotion that he wished to depict in the same way as an actor playing a tragic part can feel the emotion he represents.“What's Hecuba to him or he to Hecuba?”Here I am reminded of something an actress, at one time in Sarah Bernhardt's Company, told me many years ago. The great artist was playing Phèdre and, in the midst of one of her most moving speeches, when to all appearance she was distraught with anguish, she became aware that some persons standing in one of the wings were loudly talking; she moved towards them and, turning away from the audience as though in her misery to hide her face, hissed out what was the French equivalent to: Stop that bloody row, you lousy bastards; and then, turning back with a magnificent gesture of woe, went on with her tirade to its impressive end. The audience had noticed nothing. It is hard to believe that she could have given expression so noble and tragic to the words she had to utter unless she had truly felt them; but her emotion was a professional emotion, skin-deep, an affair of nerves rather than of heart which had no effect on her self-possession. I have no doubt that Dickens was sincere, but it was an actor's sincerity; and that, perhaps, is why now, no matter how he piled up the agony, we feel that his pathos was not quite genuine and so are no longer moved by it.

But we have no right to ask of an author more than he can give, and if Dickens lacked that high seriousness which Matthew Arnold demanded of the greatest poets, he had much else. He was a very great novelist. He had enormous gifts. He thought David Copperfield the best of all his books. An author is not always a good judge of his own work, but in this case Dickens's judgment seems to me correct. David Copperfield, as I suppose everyone knows, is in great part autobiographical; but Dickens was writing a novel, not an autobiography, and though he drew much of his material from his own life, he made only such use of it as suited his purpose. For the rest, he fell back on his vivid imagination. He was never much of a reader, literary conversation bored him, and such acquaintance with literature as he made later in life seems to have had little effect in lessening the very strong impressions he had received from the works he first read as a boy at Chatham. Of these it was, I think, the novels of Smollett that in the long run chiefly influenced him. The figures Smollett presents to the reader are not so much larger than life as more highly coloured. They are“humours”rather than characters.

So to see people well suited the idiosyncrasy of Dickens's temper. Mr. Micawber was drawn from his father. John Dickens was grandiloquent in speech and shifty in money matters, but he was no fool and far from incompetent; he was industrious, kindly and affectionate. We know what Dickens made of him. If Falstaff is the greatest comic character in literature, Mr. Micawber is the greatest but one. Dickens has been blamed, to my mind unjustly, for making him end up as a respectable magistrate in Australia, and some critics have thought that he should have remained reckless and improvident to the end. Australia was a sparsely settled country. Mr. Micawber was a man of fine presence, of some education and of flamboyant address; I do not see why, in that environment and with those advantages, he should not have attained official position. But it was not only in his creation of comic characters that Dickens was masterly. Steerforth's smooth servant is admirably drawn; he has a mysterious, sinister quality which sends cold shivers down one's back. Uriah Heep smacks of what used to be called transpontine melodrama; but for all that he is a powerful, horrifying figure, and he is most skilfully presented. Indeed, David Copperfield is filled with characters of the most astonishing variety, vividness and originality. There never were such people as the Micawbers, Peggotty and Barkis, Traddles, Betsy Trotwood and Mr. Dick, Uriah Heep and his mother: they are the fantastic inventions of Dickens's exultant imagination; but they have so much vigour, they are so consistent, they are presented with so much verisimilitude and with so much conviction, that while you read, you cannot but believe in them. They may not be real; they are very much alive.

Dickens's general method of creating character was to exaggerate the traits, peculiarities, foibles of his models and to put into the mouth of each one some phrase, or string of phrases, which stamped his quintessence on the reader's mind. He never showed the development of characters and, on the whole, what his creatures were at the beginning they remain at the end. (There are in Dickens's work one or two exceptions, but the change of nature he has indicated is highly unconvincing; it is occasioned to bring about a happy ending.) The danger of drawing character in this way is that the limits of plausibility may be exceeded, and the result is caricature. Caricature is all very well when the author presents you with a character at whom you can laugh, as you can at Mr. Micawber, but it will not serve when he expects you to sympathize. Dickens was never particularly successful with his female characters unless, like Mrs. Micawber, with her“I will never desert Mr. Micawber, ”and Betsy Trotwood, they were caricatured. Dora, drawn after Dickens's first love, Maria Beadnell, is too silly and too childish; Agnes, drawn after Mary and Georgy Hogarth, is too good and too sensible: they are both fearfully tiresome. Little Em’ly seems to me a failure. Dickens evidently meant us to feel pity for her: she only got what she asked for. Her ambition was to be a“lady, ”and in the hope, presumably, that she would be able to get Steerforth to marry her, she ran away with him. She seems to have made him a most unsatisfactory mistress, sullen, tearful and sorry for herself; and it is no wonder that he grew tired of her. The most baffling female character in David Copperfield is Rosa Dartle. I suspect that Dickens meant to make greater use of her in his story than he did, and if he did not do so, it was because he feared to offend his public. I can only suppose that Steerforth had been her lover and she hated him because he had abandoned her, but notwithstanding, loved him still with a jealous, hungry, vindictive love. Dickens here invented a character that Balzac would have made much of. Of the leading actors in David Copperfield, Steerforth is the only one that is drawn“straight, ”using the word as actors do when they speak of a“straight part.”Dickens has given the reader an admirable impression of Steerforth's charm, grace and elegance, his friendliness, his kindliness, his amiable gift of being able to get on with all kinds of people, his gaiety, his courage, his selfishness, his unscrupulousness, his recklessness, his callousness. He has drawn here a portrait of the sort of man that most of us have known, who gives delight wherever he goes and leaves disaster behind him. Dickens brought him to a bad end. Fielding, I think, would have been more lenient; for, as Mrs. Honour, speaking of Tom Jones, put it: “And when wenches are so coming, young men are not so much to be blamed neither; for to be sure they do no more than what is natural.”To-day, the novelist is under the necessity of making the events he relates not only likely, but so far as possible inevitable. Dickens was under no such constraint. That Steerforth, coming from Portugal by sea after an absence from England of some years, should be wrecked and drowned in sight of Yarmouth just when David Copperfield had gone there on a brief visit to his old friends, is a coincidence that really puts too great a strain on the reader's credulity. If Steerforth had to die in order to satisfy the Victorian demand that vice should be punished, Dickens might surely have thought of a more plausible way of bringing this about.

It was a misfortune for English literature that Keats died too soon and Wordsworth too late; it was a misfortune almost as serious that, just at the time when the greatest novelists our country has produced were in full possession of their gifts, the methods of publication then prevalent encouraged, to the detriment of their production, the tendency to diffuseness and prolixity and digression to which by their nature English novelists have for the most part been inclined. The Victorian novelists were working men who lived by their pen. They had to accept contracts to provide a definite amount of copy for eighteen, twenty or twenty-four numbers, and they had so to arrange their narrative as to end each number in such a way as to induce the reader to buy the following one. They doubtless had in mind the main lines of the story they set out to tell, but we know that they were satisfied if they had two or three numbers written before publication started. They wrote the rest as they were needed, trusting that their invention would provide them with enough material to fill the requisite number of pages; and we know, from their own admissions, that on occasion their invention failed them and they had to make the best job they could when they had nothing to write about. Sometimes it happened that their story was finished when there were perhaps two or three numbers still to be written, and then they had to use any device they could think of to delay the conclusion. Naturally their novels were shapeless and long-winded; they were forced to digression and prolixity.

Dickens wrote David Copperfield in the first person. This straightforward method served him well, since his plots were often complicated, and the reader's interest was sometimes diverted to characters and incidents that have no bearing on the story's course. In David Copperfield there is only one major digression of this kind, and that is the account of Dr. Strong's relations with his wife, his mother and his wife's cousin; it does not concern David and is in itself tedious. I surmise that he used this episode to cover on two occasions a lapse of time which otherwise he didn’t know what to do with: the first was the years that David spent at school at Canterbury, and the second was the period between David's disappointment with Dora and her death.

Dickens did not escape the danger that confronts the author of a semi-biographical novel in which himself is the principal character. David Copperfield at the age of ten was put to work by his stern stepfather, as Charles Dickens was by his father, and suffered from the“degradation”of having to mix with boys of his own age, whom he did not consider his social equals, in the same way as Dickens, in the fragment of autobiography which he gave to Forster, persuaded himself that he had suffered. Dickens did all he could to excite the reader's sympathy for his hero, and indeed, on the celebrated journey to Dover, when David ran away in order to seek the protection of his aunt Betsy Trotwood, a delightful, amusing character, he loads his dice without scruple. Innumerable readers have found the narration of this escapade wonderfully pathetic. I am made of sterner stuff. I am surprised that the little boy should have been such a ninny as to let everyone he came across rob and cheat him. After all, he had been in the factory for some months and had wandered about London early and late; one would have thought that the other boys at the factory, even though they were not up to his social standard, would have taught him a thing or two; he had lived with the Micawbers and pawned their bits and pieces for them, and had visited them at the Marshalsea: if he had really been the bright boy he is described to be, even at that tender age he would surely have acquired some knowledge of the world and enough sharpness to fend for himself. But it is not only in his childhood that David Copperfield shows himself sadly incompetent. He is incapable of coping with a difficulty. His weakness with Dora, his lack of common sense in dealing with the ordinary problems of domestic life, are almost more than one can bear; and he is so obtuse that he does not guess that Agnes is in love with him. I cannot persuade myself that in the end he became the successful novelist we are told he did. If he wrote novels, I suspect that they were more like those of Mrs. Henry Wood than those of Charles Dickens. It is strange that his creator should have given him none of his own drive, vitality and exuberance. David was slim and good-looking; and he had charm, or he would not have attracted the affection of almost everyone he encountered; he was honest, kindly and conscientious; but he was surely a bit of a fool. He remains the least interesting person in the book. Nowhere does he show himself in so poor a light, so feckless, so incapable of dealing with an awkward situation, as in the monstrous scene between Little Em’ly and Rosa Dartle in the attic in Soho which David witnesses but, for the very flimsiest reason, makes no attempt to stop. This scene affords a good example of how the method of writing a novel in the first person may result in the narrator being forced into a position so shockingly false, so unworthy of a hero of fiction, that the reader is justly indignant with him. If described in the third person, from the standpoint of omniscience, the scene would still have been melodramatic and repellent, but, even though with difficulty, credible. But of course the pleasure one gets from reading David Copperfield does not arise from any persuasion one may have that life is, or ever was, anything like what Dickens describes. That is not to depreciate him. Fiction, like the kingdom of heaven, has many mansions, and the author may invite you to visit whichever he chooses. One has just as much right to exist as another, but you must suit yourselves to the surroundings into which you are led. You must put on different spectacles to read The Golden Bowl and to read Bubu de Montparnasse. David Copperfield is a fantastication, sometimes gay, sometimes pathetic, on life, composed out of recollections and wish-fulfilments by a man of lively imagination and warm feelings. You must read it in the same spirit as you read As You Like It. It provides an entertainment almost as delightful.





Emily Brontë and Wuthering Heights


1


Hugh Prunty, a young peasant-farmer in County Down, in 1776 married Elinor McClory; and on St. Patrick's Day in the following year, the eldest of his ten children was born and given the name of Ireland's patron saint. It looks as though he could neither read nor write, for he seems to have been uncertain how his name was spelt. In the baptismal register it is given as Brunty and Bruntee. The small-holding he farmed was insufficient to provide for his large family, and he worked in a lime-kiln and, when things were slack, as a labourer on the estate of one of the neighbouring gentry. It may be supposed that Patrick, his eldest son, did odd jobs about his father's bit of land till he was old enough to earn a wage. Then he became a hand-loom weaver. But he was a clever lad, and ambitious; and, somehow or other, by the time he was sixteen he had got enough education to become a teacher at a village school near his birthplace. Two years later he got a similar job at the parish school at Drumballyroney, and held it for eight years. There are two accounts of what happened then: one states that Methodist ministers, impressed by his ability and expecting him to train himself for the Ministry, subscribed a few pounds which, added to the little he had saved, enabled him to go to Cambridge; another states that he left the parish school to become a tutor in a clergyman's family, and it was with his help that he entered St. John's College. He was then twenty-five, old to enter a university, a tall, very strong young man, handsome and vain of his good looks. He subsisted on a scholarship, two exhibitions and what he was able to earn by coaching. He took his B.A. at the age of twenty-nine, and was ordained in the Church of England. If the Methodist ministers really helped him to go to Cambridge, they must have felt that they had made a bad investment.

It was while he was at Cambridge that Patrick Branty, as his surname is spelt in the list of admissions, changed it to Bronte, but it was not till later that he adopted the diæresis, and signed himself Patrick Brontë. He was appointed to a curacy at Withersfield in Essex and there fell in love with a Miss Mary Burder. She was eighteen and, though not rich, well off. They became engaged. For some reason that has remained obscure, Mr. Brontë jilted her, and it has been supposed that, having a good opinion of his advantages, he thought that by waiting he could do better for himself. Mary Burder was bitterly hurt. It may be that the handsome curate's behaviour caused a good deal of acid comment in the parish, for he left Withersfield and took a curacy at Wellington in Shropshire and, after a few months, another at Hartshead in Yorkshire. There he met a plain little woman of thirty called Maria Branwell. She had fifty pounds a year of her own and belonged to a respectable middle-class family; Patrick Brontë was thirty-five and perhaps thought that by then, notwithstanding his good looks and agreeable brogue, this was about as well as he could expect to do for himself. He proposed, was accepted and in 1812 the couple were married. While still at Hartshead Mrs. Brontë had two children, and they were named Maria and Elizabeth. Then Mr. Brontë was appointed to still another curacy, this time near Bradford, and here Mrs. Brontë had four more children. They were named Charlotte, Patrick Branwell, Emily and Anne. A year before his marriage, Mr. Brontë had published at his own expense a volume of verse entitled Cottage Poems, and a year after that another, The Rural Minstrel. While living near Bradford he wrote a novel, called The Cottage in the Wood. People who have read these productions say that they are devoid of merit. In 1820 Mr. Brontë was appointed to the“perpetual curacy”of Haworth, a Yorkshire village, and there he remained, his ambitions, one may suppose, satisfied, till his death. He never went back to Ireland to see the parents, brothers and sisters he had left there, but as long as she lived he sent his mother twenty pounds a year.

In 1821, after nine years of marriage, Maria Brontë died of cancer. The widower persuaded his sister-in-law, Elizabeth Branwell, to leave Penzance, where she lived, to come and look after his six children; but he wanted to marry again, and after a decent interval he wrote to Mrs. Burder, mother of the girl he had treated so ill fourteen years before, to enquire whether she was still single. After some weeks he received a reply and forthwith wrote to Mary herself. The letter is smug, self-complacent, unctuous and, considering the facts, in execrable taste. He had the impudence to say that his ancient love was rekindled and that he had a longing desire to see her. It was in effect a proposal of marriage. Her reply was stinging, but, undeterred, he wrote again. With amazing tactlessness he told her: “You may think and write as you please, but I have not the least doubt that if you had been mine you would have been happier than you now are, or can be as one in single life.”(The italics are his.) Having failed with Mary Burder, he turned his thoughts in another direction. It does not seem to have occurred to him that a widower of forty-five, with six young children, was no great catch. He made an offer to Miss Elizabeth Frith, whom he had known when he was a curate near Bradford, but she also refused him; upon which he seems to have given it up as a bad job. It was, at all events, something to be thankful for that Elizabeth Branwell was there to look after the house and take care of the children.

Haworth Parsonage was a small brownstone house on the brow of the steep hill down which the village straggled. There was a tiny strip of garden in front of it and behind, and, on either side, the graveyard. Biographers of the Brontës have thought this depressing, and to a doctor it might have been, but a clergyman may well have thought it an edifying and even consoling sight; anyhow, this particular clergyman's family must have grown so accustomed to it that in all probability they noticed it as little as the fisherman at Capri notices the view of Vesuvius or of Ischia in the setting sun. There was a parlour, a study for Mr. Brontë, a kitchen and a storeroom on the ground floor, and four bedrooms and a lobby on the floor above. There were no carpets, except in the parlour and the study, and no curtains to the windows because Mr. Brontë had the greatest dread of fire. The floors and the stairs were of stone, cold and damp in winter, and Miss Branwell, for fear of catching cold, always went about the house in pattens. A narrow pathway led from the house to the moor. With the idea, perhaps barely conscious, of making the story of the Brontës more poignant, it has been customary for authors to write as though it were always bleak, bitter cold and dreary at Haworth. But of course, even in winter there were days of blue sky and brilliant sunshine, when the frosty air was invigorating, and meadows, moor and woods were painted in the tender colours of pastel. On such a day I went to Haworth. The countryside was bathed in a haze of silver-grey so that the distance, its outlines dim, was mysterious. The leafless trees had the elegance of trees in a wintry scene in a Japanese print, and the hawthorn hedges by the roadside glistened white with hoar frost. Emily's poems and Wuthering Heights tell you how thrilling the spring was on the moor, and how rich in beauty and how sensuous in summer.

Mr. Brontë walked long and far on the moor. In his old age he boasted that he had been able to walk forty miles a day. He was a man who shunned company—somewhat of a change, for as a curate he had been a social creature, fond of parties and flirtations; and, with the exception of the neighbouring parsons who sometimes came down the hills to drink a dish of tea, he saw no one but the church-wardens and his parishioners. If these sent for him he went to see them, and if they asked a service he was glad to do it, but he and his family“kept themselves very close.”He, the son of a poverty-stricken Irish peasant, would not let his children associate with the village children, and they were driven to sit in the cold little lobby on the first floor, which was their study, reading or whispering low in order not to disturb their father, who, when annoyed or displeased, maintained a sullen silence. He gave them their lessons in the morning, and Miss Branwell taught them sewing and housework.

Even before his wife's death, Mr. Brontë had taken to having his meals in his study by himself, and this habit he retained for the rest of his life. The reason given for this is that he suffered from indigestion. Emily wrote in a diary: “We are going to have for dinner boiled beef, turnips, potatoes and apple pudding.”And in 1846 Charlotte wrote from Manchester: “Papa requires nothing you know but plain beef and mutton, tea and bread and butter.”This does not seem a very good régime for someone who suffers from chronic dyspepsia. I am inclined to think that if Mr. Brontë took his meals by himself, it was because he did not much care for the company of his children and was irritable when they interrupted him. At eight o’clock at night he read family prayers, and at nine locked and barred the front door. As he passed the room in which his children were sitting, he told them not to sit up late and, halfway up the stairs, stopped to wind the clock.

Mrs. Gaskell knew Mr. Brontë for several years, and the conclusion she came to was that he was selfish, irascible and domineering; and Mary Taylor, one of Charlotte's intimate friends, wrote to another of her friends, Ellen Nussey: “I can never think without gloomy anger of Charlotte's sacrifices to the selfish old man.”Of late, attempts have been made to whitewash him. But no whitewashing can get over the letters he wrote to Mary Burder. They are published in full in Clement Shorter's The Brontës and their Circle. Nor can whitewashing get over his behaviour when his curate, Mr. Nicholls, proposed to Charlotte. I will come to that later. Mrs. Gaskell writes as follows: “Mrs. Brontë's nurse told me that one day when the children had been on the moors, and rain had come on, she thought they would be wet, and accordingly she rummaged out some coloured boots which had been given them by a friend. These little pairs she ranged round the kitchen fire to warm; but when the children came back, the boots were nowhere to be found; only a very strong odour of burnt leather was perceived. Mr. Brontë had come in and seen them; they were too gay and luxurious for his children; so he had put them into the fire. He spared nothing that offended his antique simplicity. Long before this, someone had given Mrs. Brontë a silk gown; either the make, the colour, or the material was not according to his notions of consistent propriety, and Mrs. Brontë in consequence had never worn it. But, for all that, she kept it treasured up in her drawers, which were generally locked. One day, however, while in the kitchen, she remembered that she had left the key in her drawer, and hearing Mr. Brontë upstairs, she augured some ill of her dress, and, running up in haste, she found it cut into shreds.”The story is circumstantial, but it is hard to see why the nurse should have invented it.“Once he got the hearthrug, and stuffing it up the grate, deliberately set it on fire, and remained in the room in spite of the stench, until it had smouldered and shrivelled away into uselessness. Another time he took some chairs, and sawed away at the backs till they were reduced to the condition of stools.”It is only fair to add that Mr. Brontë declared that these stories were untrue. But no one had doubted that he had a violent temper, nor that he was stern and peremptory. I have asked myself whether these unamiable traits of Mr. Brontë's may not be ascribed to his disappointment with life. Like many another man of humble origins who has had a galling struggle to raise himself above the class in which he was born and to get an education, he may well have had an exaggerated opinion of his abilities. We know that he was vain of his good looks. His literary efforts had met with no success. It would not be strange if it embittered him to realize that the only reward he had got for his long tussle with adversity was a perpetual curacy in the wilds of Yorkshire.

The hardships and loneliness of life at the parsonage have been made too much of. The talented sisters seem to have been quite satisfied with it; and indeed, if they ever stopped to consider their father's origin, they may well have thought themselves far from unlucky. They were neither better nor worse off than hundreds of parsons’ daughters all over England, whose lives were as isolated and whose means as limited. The Brontës had neighbours, clergymen within walking distance, gentry, mill-owners and manufacturers in a small way, with whom they might have consorted; and if they lived secluded lives it was by choice. They were not rich, but neither were they poor. Mr. Brontë's benefice provided him with a house and two hundred pounds a year, his wife had fifty pounds a year which, on her death, he presumably inherited, and Elizabeth Branwell, when she came to live at Haworth, brought her fifty pounds a year with her. The household thus had three hundred pounds a year to dispose of, which at that time was worth at least twelve hundred pounds now. Many a clergyman to-day, even with income-tax as it is, would look upon such a sum as riches. Many a clergyman's wife to-day would be thankful to have one maid: the Brontës generally had two, and whenever there was pressure of work, girls were brought in from the village to help.

In 1824 Mr. Brontë took his four elder daughters to a school at Cowan Bridge. It had been recently established to give an education to the daughters of poor clergymen. The place was unhealthy, the food bad and the administration incompetent. The two elder girls died, and Charlotte and Emily, whose health was affected, were, fortunately for themselves, after a like while, removed. Such schooling as they got, from then on, seems to have been given them by their aunt. Mr. Brontë thought more of his son than of the three girls and, indeed, Branwell was looked upon as the clever one of the family. Mr. Brontë would not send him to school, but undertook his education himself. The boy had a precocious talent, and his manners were engaging. His friend, F. H. Grundy, thus describes him: “He was insignificantly small—one of his life's trials. He had a mass of red hair, which he wore brushed high off his forehead—to help his height, I fancy—a great, bumpy, intellectual forehead, nearly half the size of the whole facial contour; small ferrety eyes, deep sunk and still further hidden by the never removed spectacles, prominent nose, but weak lower features. He had a downcast look, which never varied, save for a rapid momentary glance at long intervals. Small and thin of person, he was the reverse of attractive at first sight.”He had parts, and his sisters admired him and expected him to do great things. He was a brilliant, eager talker, and from some Irish ancestor, for his father was a morose, silent man, he had inherited a gift for social intercourse and an agreeable loquacity. When a traveller, putting up for the night at the Black Bull, seemed lonely, the landlord would ask him: “Do you want someone to help you with your bottle, sir? If so, I’ll send up for Patrick.”Branwell was always glad to be of service. I should add that when years later, Charlotte Brontë then being famous, the landlord was asked about this, he denied that he had ever done anything of the kind: “Branwell, ”he said, “never needed to be sent for.”You are still shown at Haworth the room at the Black Bull, with its windsor chairs, in which Branwell tippled with his friends.

When Charlotte was just under sixteen, she went to school once more, this time at Roe Head, and was happy there; but after a year she came home again to teach her two younger sisters. Though the family, as I have pointed out, were not so poor as has been made out, the girls had nothing to look forward to. Mr. Brontë's stipend would naturally cease at his death, and Miss Branwell was leaving the little money she had to her amusing nephew; they decided, therefore, that the only way they could earn a living was by training themselves to be governesses or school-mistresses. At that time there was no other calling open to women who looked upon themselves as ladies. Branwell, by now, was eighteen and a decision had to be made on what trade or profession he was to adopt. He had some facility for drawing, as his sisters had too, and he was eager to become a painter. It was settled that he should go to London and study at the Royal Academy. He went, but nothing came of the project, and after a while, which he spent in sightseeing and presumably having as good a time as he could, he returned to Haworth. He tried writing, but with no success; then he persuaded his father to set him up in a studio in Bradford where he might earn a living by painting portraits of the local people; but this failed too, and Mr. Brontë called him home. Then he became tutor to a Mr. Postlethwaite at Barrow-in-Furness. He seems to have done well enough there, but, for reasons unknown, after six months Mr. Brontë brought him back to Haworth. Presently, a job was found for him as clerk-in-charge at the station of Sowerby Bridge on the Leeds and Manchester Railway, and later at Luddenden Foot. He was bored and lonely, he drank too much, and eventually was discharged for gross neglect of his duties. Meanwhile, in 1835, Charlotte had returned to Roe Head as a teacher, and taken Emily with her as a pupil. But Emily became so desperately homesick that she fell ill, and had to be sent home. Anne, who was of a calmer, more submissive temper, took her place. Charlotte held her job for three years, at the end of which, her health failing, she too went home.

She was twenty-two. Branwell was not only a source of worry, but a source of expense; and Charlotte, as soon as she was well enough, felt herself obliged to take a situation as a nursery governess. It was not work she liked. Neither she nor her sisters liked children, any more than their father did.“Ifind it so hard to repel the rude familiarity of children, ”she wrote to Ellen Nussey. She hated to be in a dependent position, and was continually on the lookout for affronts. She was not an easy person to get on with, and so far as one can judge from her letters, seems to have expected to be asked to do as a favour what her employers quite naturally thought they could demand as a right. She left after three months and returned to the parsonage, but some two years later took another situation with a Mr. and Mrs. White at Rawdon, near Bradford. Charlotte did not think them refined.“Well can I believe that Mrs. W. has been an exciseman's daughter, and I am convinced also that Mr. W.'s extraction is very low.”She was, however, fairly happy in this place, but, as she wrote to the same intimate friend: “No one but myself can tell how hard a governess's life is to me—for no one but myself is aware how utterly averse my whole mind and nature are for the employment.”She had long been toying with the idea of keeping a school of her own, with her two sisters, and now she took it up again; the Whites, who seem to have been very kind, decent people, encouraged her, but suggested that before she could hope to be successful she must acquire certain qualifications. Though she could read French, she could not speak it, and knew no German, so she decided that she must go abroad to learn languages. Miss Branwell was persuaded to advance money for the cost of this; and then Charlotte and Emily, with Mr. Brontë to look after them on the journey, set out for Brussels. The two girls, Charlotte being then twenty-six, Emily twenty-two, became pupils at the Pensionnat Héger. After ten months they were recalled to England by the illness of Miss Branwell. She died, and having disinherited Branwell, owing to his bad behaviour, left the little she had to her nieces. It was enough for them to carry out the plan they had so long discussed of having a school of their own; but since their father was old and his sight failing, they made up their minds to set it up at the parsonage. Charlotte did not think she was sufficiently equipped, and so accepted Monsieur Héger's offer to go back to Brussels and teach English at his school. She spent a year there and on her return to Haworth the three sisters issued prospectuses, and Charlotte wrote to her friends asking them to recommend the school they intended to start. How they expected to house pupils in the parsonage which had only four bedrooms, all of which they occupied themselves, has never been explained, and as no pupils came it certainly never will be.

They had been writing off and on since they were children, and in 1846 the three of them published a volume of verse at their own expense under the names of Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell. It cost them fifty pounds, and two copies were sold. Each of them then wrote a novel. Charlotte's (Currer Bell) was called The Professor, Emily's (Ellis Bell) Wuthering Heights and Anne's (Acton Bell) Agnes Grey. They were refused by publisher after publisher; but when Smith, Elder＆Co., to whom Charlotte's The Professor had finally been sent, returned it, they wrote to say that they would be glad to consider a longer novel by her. She was finishing one, and within a month was able to send it to the publishers. They accepted it. It was called Jane Eyre. Emily's novel, and Anne's, had also at last been accepted by a publisher, Newby by name, “on terms somewhat impoverishing to the two authors, ”and they had corrected the proofs before Charlotte sent Jane Eyre to Smith, Elder＆Co. Though the reviews of Jane Eyre were not particularly good, readers liked it and it became a best-seller. Mr. Newby, upon this, tried to persuade the public that Wuthering Heights and Agnes Grey, which he then published together in three volumes, were by the author of Jane Eyre. They made, however, no impression, and indeed were regarded by a number of critics as early and immature work by Currer Bell. Mr. Brontë had consented, after some persuasion, to read Jane Eyre. When he came in to tea, after finishing it, he said: “Girls, do you know Charlotte has been writing a book, and it is much better than likely?”

At the time of Miss Branwell's death, Anne was in a situation at Thorpe Green as governess to the children of a certain Mrs. Robinson. Her nature was sweet and gentle, and she was apparently better able to get on with people than the exacting and prickly Charlotte. She was not unhappy in her situation. She went back to Haworth for her aunt's funeral, and on her return to Thorpe Green took with her Branwell, then idling at home, as tutor to Mrs. Robinson's son. Mr. Edmund Robinson, a wealthy clergyman, was an elderly invalid with a youngish wife, and Branwell, though she was seventeen years older than he, fell in love with her. What their relations were is uncertain. Anyhow, whatever they were, they were discovered. Branwell was sent packing, and Mr. Robinson ordered him“never to see again the mother of his children, never set foot in her house, never write or speak to her.”Branwell“stormed, raved, swore he could not live without her; cried out against her for staying with her husband. Then prayed the sick man might die soon; they would yet be happy.”Branwell had always drunk too much; now in his distress he took to eating opium. It seems, however, that he was able to communicate with Mrs. Robinson, and, some months after his dismissal, they appear to have met at Harrogate.“It is said that she proposed flight together, ready to forfeit all her grandeur. It was Branwell who advised patience and a little longer waiting.”Since this can only have been told by Branwell himself, and is in any case very unlikely to be true, we may accept it as an invention of a young man who was both silly and conceited. Suddenly he received a letter to announce the death of Mr. Robinson; “he fair danced down the churchyard as if he was out of his mind; he was so fond of that woman, ”someone told Mary Robinson, Emily's biographer.

“The next morning he rose, dressed himself with care and prepared for a journey; but before he had even set out from Haworth, two men came riding to the village post-haste. They sent for Branwell and when he arrived, in a great state of excitement, one of the riders dismounted and went with him into the Black Bull.”He brought a message from the widow begging him not to come near her again, for if she even saw him once she would lose her fortune and the custody of her children. This is what he told, but since the letter was never produced and it has been discovered that Mr. Robinson's will contained no such clause, there is no knowing whether he told the truth. The only thing sure is that Mrs. Robinson let him know that she wanted to have nothing more to do with him, and it may be that she made up this excuse to render the blow less mortifying. The Brontë family were convinced that she had been Branwell's mistress, and ascribed his consequent behaviour to her evil influence. It is possible that she was, but it is just as possible that, like many a man before and after him, he boasted of a conquest he had never made. But if she had been for a brief period infatuated with him, there is no reason to suppose that it had ever entered her head to marry him. He proceeded to drink himself to death. When he knew the end was near, one who attended him in his last illness told Mrs. Gaskell that, wanting to stand up to die, he insisted upon getting up. He had only been in bed a day. Charlotte was so upset that she had to be led away, but her father, Anne and Emily looked on while he rose to his feet and after a struggle that lasted twenty minutes died, as he wished, standing.

Emily never went out of doors after the Sunday following his death. She had a cold and a cough. It grew worse, and Charlotte wrote to Ellen Nussey: “I fear she has pain in the chest, and I sometimes catch a shortness in her breathing, when she has moved at all quickly. She looks very, very thin and pale. Her reserved nature causes me great uneasiness of mind. It is useless to question her; you get no answer. It is still more useless to recommend remedies; they are never adopted.”A week or two later, Charlotte wrote to another friend: “I would fain hope that Emily is a little better this evening, but it is difficult to ascertain this. She is a real stoic in illness; she neither seeks nor will accept sympathy. To put any questions, to offer any aid, is to annoy; she will not yield a step before pain or sickness till forced; not one of her ordinary avocations will she voluntarily renounce. You must look on and see her do what she is unfit to do, and not dare say a word…”One morning Emily got up as usual, dressed herself and began to sew; she was short of breath and her eyes were glazed, but she went on working. She grew steadily worse. She had always refused to see a doctor, but at last, at midday asked that one should be sent for. It was too late. At two she died.

Charlotte was at work on another novel, Shirley, but she put it aside to nurse Anne, who was attacked by what was then known as galloping consumption, the disease from which Branwell and Emily had died, and did not finish it till after the gentle creature's death only five months after Emily's. She went to London in 1849 and 1850, and was made much of; she was introduced to Thackeray and had her portrait painted by George Richmond. A Mr. James Taylor, a member of the firm of Smith, Elder, whom she described as a stern and abrupt little man, asked her to marry him, but she refused. Before that, two young clergymen had proposed to her, only to be rejected, and two or three curates, her father's or those of neigh bouring parsons, had shown her marked attention; but Emily discouraged suitors (her sisters called her the Major, because of the effective way she dealt with them), and her father disapproved, so that nothing had come of it. It was, however, a curate of her father's whom she at last married. This was the Rev. Arthur Nicholls. He went to Haworth in 1844. Writing to Ellen Nussey in that year, she said of him: “I cannot for my life see those interesting germs of goodness you discovered; his narrowness of mind always strikes me chiefly.”And, a couple of years later, she included him in her sweeping contempt of curates in general.“They regard me as an old maid, and I regard them, one and all, as highly uninteresting, narrow and unattractive specimens of the coarser sex.”Mr. Nicholls, an Irishman, went to Ireland on his holiday, and Charlotte wrote to her usual correspondent: “Mr. Nicholls is not yet returned. I am sorry to say that many of the parishioners express a desire that he should not trouble himself to recross the Channel.”

In 1852 Charlotte wrote a long letter to Ellen Nussey. She enclosed a note from Mr. Nicholls which, she said, “has left on my mind a feeling of deep concern…”“What papa has seen or guessed I will not inquire, though I may conjecture. He has irritably noticed all Mr. Nicholls's low spirits, all his threats of expatriation, all his symptoms of impaired health—noticed them with little sympathy and much indirect sarcasm. On Monday evening Mr. Nicholls was here to tea. I vaguely felt without clearly seeing, as without seeing I have felt for some time, the meaning of his constant looks, and strange feverish restraint. After tea I withdrew to the dining-room as usual. As usual Mr. Nicholls sat with papa till between eight and nine o’clock; I then heard him open the parlour door as if going. I expected the clash of the front door. He stopped in the passage; he tapped; like lightning it flashed on me what was coming. He entered; he stood before me. What his words were you can guess; his manner you can hardly realize, nor can I forget it. Shaking from head to foot, looking deadly pale, speaking low, vehemently, yet with difficulty, he made me for the first time feel what it costs a man to declare affection where he doubts response.

“The spectacle of one ordinarily so statue-like thus trembling, stirred, and overcome, gave me a kind of strange shock. He spoke of sufferings he had borne for months, of sufferings he could endure no longer, and craved leave for some hope. I could only entreat him to leave me then and promise a reply on the morrow. I asked him if he had spoken to papa. He said he dared not. I think I half led, half put him out of the room. When he was gone I immediately went to papa, and told him what had taken place. Agitation and anger disproportionate to the occasion ensued; if I had loved Mr. Nicholls, and had heard such epithets applied to him as were used, it would have transported me past my patience; as it was, my blood boiled with a sense of injustice. But papa worked himself into a state not to be tri fled with; the veins on his temples started up like whipcord, and his eyes became suddenly bloodshot. I made haste to promise that Mr. Nicholls should on the morrow have a distinct refusal.”

In another letter, dated three days later, Charlotte writes: “You ask how papa demeans himself to Mr. Nicholls. I only wish you were here to see papa in his present mood: you would know something of him. He just treats him with a hardness not to be bent, and a contempt not to be propitiated. The two have had no interview as yet; all has been done by letter. Papa wrote, I must say, a most cruel note to Mr. Nicholls on Wednesday.”She went on to say that her father thought“a little too much about his want of money; he says the match would be a degradation, that I should be throwing myself away, that he expects me, if I marry at all, to do very differently.”Mr. Brontë, in fact, behaved as badly as he had behaved years before to Mary Burder. Relations between Mr. Brontë and Mr. Nicholls grew so strained that the latter resigned his curacy. But his successors at Haworth did not give Mr. Brontë satisfaction, and Charlotte, at last exasperated by his complaints, told him that he had only himself to blame. He had only to let her marry Mr. Nicholls and all would be well. Papa continued“very, very hostile, bitterly unjust, ”but she saw and corresponded with Mr. Nicholls. They became engaged and in 1854 were married. She was then thirty-eight. She died in childbirth nine months later.

So the Rev. Patrick Brontë, having buried his wife, her sister and his six children, was left to eat his dinner alone in the solitude he liked, walk on the moors as far as his waning strength permitted, read the papers, preach his sermons and wind up the clock on his way to bed. There is a photograph of him in his old age. A man in a black suit with an immense white choker round his neck, with white hair cut short, a fine brow and a large straight nose, a tight mouth and ill-tempered eyes behind his spectacles. He died at Haworth at the age of eighty-four.

It is not without intention that in writing of Emily Brontë and Wuthering Heights, I have said so much more about her father, her brother and her sister Charlotte than about her; for in the books written about the family it is of them that we hear most. Emily and Anne hardly come into the picture. Anne was a gentle, pretty little thing, but insignificant; and her talent was small. Emily was very different. She is a strange, mysterious and shadowy figure. She is never seen directly, but reflected, as it were, in a moorland pool. You have to guess what sort of woman she was from her one novel, her poems, from an allusion here and there and from scattered anecdotes. She was aloof, an intense, uncomfortable creature; and when you hear of her given over to unrestrained gaiety, as on walks over the moor she sometimes was, it makes you uneasy. Charlotte had friends, Anne had friends, Emily had none. Her character was full of contradictions. She was harsh, dogmatic, self-willed, sullen, angry and intolerant; and she was pious, dutiful, hard-working, uncomplaining, tender to those she loved and patient.

Mary Robinson describes her at fifteen as“a tall, long-armed girl, full grown, elastic as to tread; with a slight figure that looked queenly in her best dresses, but loose and boyish when she slouched over the moors, whistling the dogs, and taking long strides over the rough earth. A tall, thin, loose-jointed girl—not ugly, but with irregular features and a pallid thick complexion. Her dark hair was naturally beautiful, and in later days looked well, loosely fastened with a tall comb at the back of her head; but in 1833 she wore it in an unbecoming tight curl and frizz. She had beautiful eyes of a hazel colour.”Like her father, her brother and her sisters, she wore spectacles. She had an aquiline nose and a large, expressive, prominent mouth. She dressed regardless of fashion, with leg-of-mutton sleeves long after they had ceased to be worn; in straight long skirts clinging to her lanky figure.

She went to Brussels with Charlotte. She hated it. Friends, wishing to be nice to the two girls, asked them to spend Sundays and holidays at their house, but they were so shy that to go was agony for them, and after a while their hosts came to the conclusion that it was kinder not to invite them. Emily had no patience with social small talk, which of course is for the most part trivial; it is merely an expression of general amiability, and people take part in it because they have good manners. Emily was too shy to take part in it and was irritated by those who did. There was in her shyness both diffidence and arrogance. If she was so retiring, it is strange that she should have made herself so conspicuous in her dress. The very shy not uncommonly have in them a streak of exhibitionism, and it may occur to one that she wore those absurd leg-of-mutton sleeves to flaunt her contempt for the commonplace people in whose company she was tongue-tied.

At school, during the hours of recreation, the two sisters always walked together, Emily leaning heavily on her sister, and generally in silence. When they were spoken to, Charlotte answered. Emily rarely spoke to anyone. They were both of them several years older than the rest of the girls, and they disliked their noisiness, their high spirits and the sillinesses natural to their age. Monsieur Héger found Emily intelligent, but so stubborn that she would listen to no reason when it interfered with her wishes or beliefs. He found her egotistical, exacting and, with Charlotte, tyrannical. But he recognized that there was something unusual in her. She should have been a man, he said: “Her strong, imperious will would never have been daunted by opposition or difficulty; never have given way but with life.”

When Emily went back to Haworth after Miss Branwell's death, it was for good. She never left it again. It looks as though only there was she able to live the reveries which were the solace and the torment of her life.

She got up in the morning before anyone else and did the roughest part of the day's work before Tabby, the maid, who was old and frail, came down. She did the household ironing and most of the cooking. She made the bread, and the bread was good. While kneading the dough, she would glance at the book propped up before her.“Those who worked with her in the kitchen, young girls called in to help in stress of business, remember how she would keep a scrap of paper, a pencil at her side, and how when the moment came that she could pause in her cooking or her ironing, she would jot down some impatient thought and then resume her work. With these girls she was always friendly and hearty—pleasant, sometimes quite jovial like a boy! So genial and kind, a little masculine, ‘say my informants, ’ but of strangers she was exceedingly timid, and if the butcher's boy or the baker's man came to the kitchen door she would be off like a bird into the hall or the parlour till she heard their hobnails clumping down the path.”She disliked men, and with one exception, was not even ordinarily polite to her father's curates; this was the Rev. William Weightman. He is described as young and fair, eloquent and witty; and there was about him“a certain girlishness of looks, manner and taste.”He was known in the family as Miss Celia Amelia. Emily got on famously with him. It is not difficult to know why. May Sinclair, in her book called The Three Brontës, constantly uses the word virile when she speaks of her. Romer Wilson, speaking of Emily, asks: “Did the lonely father see himself in her and feel that she was the only other male spirit in his house?…She early knew the boy in herself, and later knew the man.”Shirley, in Charlotte's novel, is understood to have been modelled on Emily; it is curious that Shirley's old governess should reprove her for constantly speaking of herself as though she were a male; it is not a usual thing for a girl to do, and one can only suppose that it was a habit of Emily's. Much in her character and behaviour that disconcerted her contemporaries can to-day be easily explained. Homosexuality was not at that period openly discussed as it is now, often to an embarrassing extent, but it existed, both in men and women, as it has always done, and it may well be that neither Emily herself, her family nor her family's friends, for, as I have said, she had none of her own, recognized what made her so strange.

Mrs. Gaskell did not like her. Someone told her that Emily“never showed regard to any human creature; all her love was reserved for animals.”She liked them wild and intractable. She was given a bulldog called Keeper, and concerning him, Mrs. Gaskell tells a curious story: “Keeper was faithful to the depths of his nature so long as he was with friends; but he who struck him with stick or whip, roused the relentless nature of the brute, who flew at his throat forthwith, and held him there till one or the other was at the point of death. Now Keeper's household fault was this. He loved to steal upstairs, and stretch his square, tawny limbs on the comfortable beds, covered over with delicate white counterpanes. But the cleanliness of the parsonage arrangements was perfect; and this habit of Keeper's was so objectionable, that Emily, in reply to Tabby's remonstrances, declared that, if he was found again transgressing, she herself, in defiance of warning and his well-known ferocity of nature, would beat him so severely that he would never offend again. In the gathering dusk of an autumn evening Tabby came, half-triumphantly, half-tremblingly, but in great wrath, to tell Emily that Keeper was lying on the best bed, in drowsy voluptuousness. Charlotte saw Emily's whitening face and set mouth, but dared not speak to interfere, no one dared when Emily's eyes glowed in that manner out of the paleness of her face, and when her lips were compressed into stone. She went upstairs, and Tabby and Charlotte stood in the gloomy passage below, full of the dark shadows of the coming night. Downstairs came Emily, dragging after her the unwilling Keeper, his hind legs set in a heavy attitude of resistance, held by the ‘skuft of his neck, ’ but growling low and savagely all the time. The watchers would fain have spoken, but durst not, for fear of taking off Emily's attention, and causing her to avert her head for a moment from the enraged brute. She let him go, planted in a dark corner at the bottom of the stairs; no time was there to fetch stick or rod, for fear of the strangling clutch at her throat—her bare clenched fist struck against his red fierce eyes, before he had time to make his spring, and in the language of the turf, she ‘punished’ him till his eyes were swelled up, and the half-blind stupefied beast was led to his accustomed lair, to have his swollen head fomented and cared for by the very Emily herself.”

Charlotte wrote of her: “Disinterested and energetic she certainly is; but if she be not quite so tractable and open to conviction as I could wish, I must remember perfection is not the lot of humanity.”Emily's temper was uncertain and her sisters appear to have been not a little afraid of her. From Charlotte's letters one gathers that she was puzzled and often irritated by Emily, and it is plain that she didn’t know what to make of Wuthering Heights; she had no notion that her sister had produced a book of astonishing originality, and one compared with which her own were commonplace. She felt constrained to apologize for it. When it was proposed to republish it, she undertook to edit it.“I am likewise compelling myself to read it over, for the first time of opening the book since my sister's death, ”she wrote.“Its power fills me with renewed admiration; but yet I am oppressed: the reader is scarcely permitted a taste of unalloyed pleasure, every beam of sunshine is poured down through black bars of threatening cloud; every page is surcharged with a sort of moral electricity; and the writer was unconscious of it.”And again: “If the auditor of her work, when read in manuscript, shuddered under the guiding influence of natures so relentless and so implacable—of spirits so lost and fallen; if it was complained that the mere hearing of certain vivid and fearful scenes banished sleep by night, and disturbed mental peace by day, Ellis Bell would wonder what was meant, and suspect the complainant of affectation. Had she but lived, her mind would of itself have grown like a strong tree—loftier, straighter, wider-spreading—and its matured fruits would have attained a mellower ripeness and sunnier bloom; but on that mind time and experience alone could work; to the influence of other intellects it was not amenable.”One is inclined to think that Charlotte never knew her sister.

Wuthering Heights is an extraordinary book. For the most part, novels betray their period, not only in the manner of writing common to the time at which they were written, but also by their concurrence with the climate of opinion of their day, the moral outlook of their authors, the prejudices they accept or reject. Young David Copperfield might very well have written (though with less talent) the same sort of novel as Jane Eyre, and Arthur Pendennis might have written a novel something like Villette, though the influence of Laura would doubtless have led him to eschew the naked sexuality which gives Charlotte Brontë's book its poignancy. But Wuthering Heights is an exception. It is related in no way to the fiction of the time. It is a very bad novel. It is a very good one. It is ugly. It has beauty. It is a terrible, an agonizing, a powerful and a passionate book. Some have thought it impossible that a clergyman's daughter who led a retired humdrum life, and knew few people and nothing of the world, could have written it. This seems to me absurd. Wuthering Heights is wildly romantic: now, romanticism eschews the patient observation of realism; it revels in the unbridled flight of the imagination and indulges, sometimes with gusto, sometimes with gloom, in horror, mystery, passion and violence. Given Emily Brontë's character, and fierce, repressed emotions, which what we know of her suggests, Wuthering Heights is just the sort of book one would have expected her to write. But on the face of it, it is much more the sort of book that her scapegrace brother Branwell might have written, and a number of people have been able to persuade themselves that he had in whole or in part done so. One of them, Francis Grundy, wrote: “Patrick Brontë declared to me, and what his sister said bore out the assertion, that he wrote a great part of Wuthering Heights himself….The weird fancies of diseased genius with which he used to entertain me on our long walks at Luddenden Foot, reappear in the pages of the novel, and I am inclined to believe that the very plot was his invention rather than his sister's.”On one occasion two of Branwell's friends, Dearden and Leyland by name, arranged to meet him at an inn on the road to Keighley to read their poetical effusions to one another; and this is what Dearden some twenty years later wrote to the Halifax Guardian: “I read the firs tact of the Demon Queen; but when Branwell dived into his hat—the usual receptacle of his fugitive scraps—where he supposed he had deposited his manuscript poem, he found he had by mistake placed there a number of stray leaves of a novel on which he had been trying his ‘prentice hand.’ Chagrined at the disappointment he had caused, he was about to return the papers to his hat, when both friends earnestly pressed him to read them, as they felt a curiosity to see how he could wield the pen of a novelist. After some hesitation, he complied with the request, and riveted our attention for about an hour, dropping each sheet, when read, into his hat. The story broke off abruptly in the middle of a sentence, and he gave us the sequel, viva voce, together with the real names of the prototypes of his characters, but, as some of these persons are still living, I refrain from pointing them out to the public. He said he had not yet fixed upon a title for the production, and was afraid he would never be able to meet with a publisher who would have the hardihood to usher it into the world. The scene of the fragment which Branwell read, and the characters introduced in it—so far as they developed—were the same as those in Wuthering Heights, which Charlotte confidently asserts was the production of her sister Emily.”

Now this is either a pack of lies, or it is true. Charlotte despised and, within the bounds of Christian charity, hated her brother; but as we know, Christian charity has always been able to make allowances for a lot of good honest hatred, and Charlotte's unsupported word cannot be accepted. She may have persuaded herself, as people often do, to believe what she wanted to believe. The story is circumstantial, and it is odd that anyone should, for no particular reason, have invented it. What is the explanation? There is none. It has been suggested that Branwell wrote the first four chapters, and then, drunk and doped as he was, gave it up, whereupon Emily took it over. The argument that these chapters are written in a more stilted manner than the subsequent ones does not, to my mind, hold water; and if there is in them a somewhat greater pomposity in the writing, I should ascribe it to a not unsuccessful attempt on Emily's part to show that Lockwood was a silly, conceited ape. I have no doubt at all that Emily, and Emily alone, wrote Wuthering Heights.

It must be admitted that it is badly written. The Brontë sisters did not write well. Like the governesses they were, they affected the turgid and pedantic style for which the word literatise has been coined. The main part of the story is told by Mrs. Dean, a Yorkshire maid of all work like the Brontës’ Tabby; a conversational style would have been suitable; Emily makes her express herself as no human being could. Here is a typical utterance: “I tried to smooth away all disquietude on the subject, by affirming, with frequent iteration, that that betrayal of trust, if it merited so harsh an appellation, should be the last.”Emily Brontë seems to have been aware that she was putting into Mrs. Dean's mouth words that it was unlikely she would have known, and to explain it, makes her say that in the course of her service she has had the opportunity to read books, but, even at that, the pretentiousness of her discourse is appalling. She does not read a letter, she peruses an epistle; she doesn’t send a letter, but a missive. She does not leave a room, she quits a chamber. She calls her day's work her diurnal occupation. She commences rather than begins. People don’t shout or yell, they vociferate; nor do they listen, they hearken. There is pathos in this parson's daughter striving so hard to write in a lady-like way, only to succeed in being genteel. Yet one would not wish Wuthering Heights to have been written with grace: it would be none the better for being better written. Just as in one of those early Flemish pictures of the burial of Christ the anguished grimaces of the emaciated creatures concerned, their stiff, ungainly gestures, seem to add a greater horror, a matter-of-fact brutality, to the scene, which makes it more poignant, more tragic, than when the same event is pictured in beauty by Titian; so there is in this uncouth stylization of the language something which strangely heightens the violent passion of the story.

Wuthering Heights is clumsily constructed. That is not surprising, for Emily Brontë had never written a novel before, and she had a complicated story to tell, dealing with two generations. This is a difficult thing to do because the author has to give some sort of unity to two sets of characters and two sets of events; and he must be careful not to allow the interest of one to overshadow the interest of the other. This Emily did not succeed in doing. After the death of Catherine Earnshaw there is, until you come to the last finely imaginative pages, some loss of power. The younger Catherine is an unsatisfactory character, and Emily Brontë seems not to have known what to make of her; obviously she could not give her the passionate independence of the older Catherine, nor the foolish weakness of her father. She is a spoilt, silly, wilful and ill-mannered creature; and you cannot greatly pity her sufferings. The steps are not made clear which led to her falling in love with young Hareton. He is a shadowy figure, and you know no more of him than that he was sullen and handsome. The author of such a story as I am now considering has also to compress the passage of years into a period of time that can be accepted by the reader with a comprehensive glance, as one seizes in a single view the whole of a vast fresco. I do not suppose that Emily Brontë deliberately thought out how to get a unity of impression into a straggling story, but I think she must have asked herself how to make it coherent; and it may have occurred to her that she could best do this by making one character narrate the long succession of events to another. It is a convenient way of telling a story, and she did not invent it. Its disadvantage is that it is impossible to maintain anything like a conversational manner when the narrator has to tell a number of things, descriptions of scenery for instance, which no sane person would think of doing. And of course if you have a narrator (Mrs. Dean) you must have a listener (Lockwood). It is possible that an experienced novelist might have found a better way of telling the story of Wuthering Heights, but I cannot believe that if Emily Brontë used it, it was because she was working on a foundation of someone else's invention.

But more than that, I think the method she adopted might have been expected of her, when you consider her extreme, her morbid, shyness and her reticence. What were the alternatives? One was to write the novel from the standpoint of omniscience, as, for instance, Middlemarch and Madame Bovary are written. I think it would have shocked her harsh, uncompromising virtue to tell the outrageous story as a creation of her own; and if she had, moreover, she could hardly have avoided giving some account of Heathcliff during the few years he spent away from Wuthering Heights—years in which he managed to acquire an education and make quite a lot of money. She couldn’t do this, because she simply didn’t know how he had done it. The fact the reader is asked to accept is hard to believe, and she was content to state it and leave it at that. Another alternative was to have the story narrated to her, Emily Brontë, by Mrs. Dean, say, and tell it then in the first person; but I suspect that that, too, would have brought her into a contact with the reader too close for her quivering sensitivity. By having the story in its beginning told by Lockwood, and unfolded to Lockwood by Mrs. Dean, she hid herself behind, as it were, a double mask. Mr. Brontë told Mrs. Gaskell a story which in this connection has significance. When his children were young, he, desiring to find out something of their natures which their timidity concealed from him, made each in turn put on an old mask, under cover of which they could answer more freely the questions he put to them. When he asked Charlotte what was the best book in the world, she answered: The Bible; but when he asked Emily what he had best do with her troublesome brother Branwell, she said: “Reason with him; and when he won’t listen to reason, whip him.”

And why did Emily need to hide herself when she wrote this powerful, passionate and terrible book? I think because she disclosed in it her innermost instincts. She looked deep into the well of loneliness in her heart, and saw there unavowable secrets of which, notwithstanding, her impulse as a writer drove her to unburden herself. It is said that her imagination was kindled by the weird stories her father used to tell of the Ireland of his youth, and by the tales of Hoffmann which she learned to read when she went to school in Belgium, and which she continued to read, we are told, back at the parsonage, seated on a hearthrug by the fire with her arm around Keeper's neck. I am willing to believe that she found in the stories of mystery, violence and horror of the German romantic writers something that appealed to her own fierce nature; but I think she found Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw in the hidden depths of her own soul. I think she was herself Heathcliff, I think she was herself Catherine Earnshaw. Is it strange that she should have put herself into the two chief characters of her book? Not at all. We are none of us all of a piece; more than one person dwells within us, often in uncanny companionship with his fellows; and the peculiarity of the writer of fiction is that he has the power to objectify the diverse persons of which he is compounded in individual characters: his misfortune is that he cannot bring to life characters, however necessary to his story they may be, in which there is no part of himself. That is why the younger Catherine in Wuthering Heights is unsatisfactory.

I think Emily put the whole of herself into Heathcliff. She gave him her violent rage, her sexuality, vehement but frustrated, her passion of unsatisfied love, her jealousy, her hatred and contempt of human beings, her cruelty, her sadism. The reader will remember the incident when, with so little reason, she beat with her naked fist the face of the dog she loved, as perhaps she loved no human being. There is another curious circumstance related by Ellen Nussey.“She enjoyed leading Charlotte where she would not dare to go of her own free will. Charlotte had a mortal dread of unknown animals, and it was Emily's pleasure to lead her into close vicinity, and then tell her of how and what she had done, laughing at her horror with great amusement.”I think Emily loved Catherine Earnshaw with Heathcliff's masculine, animal love; I think she laughed, as she had laughed at Charlotte's fears, when, as Heathcliff, she kicked and trampled on Earnshaw and dashed his head against the stone flags, and I think when, as Heathcliff, she hit the younger Catherine in the face and heaped humiliations upon her, she laughed. I think it gave her a thrill of release when she bullied, reviled and browbeat the persons of her invention, because in real life she suffered such bitter mortification in the company of her fellow-creatures; and I think, as Catherine, doubling the roles, as it were, though she fought Heathcliff, though she despised him, though she knew him for the beast he was, she loved him with her body and soul, she exulted in her power over him, and since there is in the sadist something of the masochist too, she was fascinated by his violence, his brutality and his untamed nature. She felt they were kin, as indeed they were, if I am right in supposing they were both Emily Brontë.“Nelly, I am Heathcliff, ”Catherine cried.“He's always in my mind: not as a pleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to myself, but as my own being.”

Wuthering Heights is a love story, perhaps the strangest that was ever written, and not the least strange part of it is that the lovers remain chaste. Catherine was passionately in love with Heathcliff, as passionately in love with him as Heathcliff was with her. For Edgar Linton, Catherine felt only a kindly, and often exasperated, tolerance. One wonders why those two people who were consumed with love did not, whatever the poverty that might have faced them, run away together. One wonders why they didn’t become real lovers. It may be that Emily's upbringing caused her to look upon adultery as an unforgivable sin, or it may be that the idea of sexual intercourse between the sexes filled her with disgust. I believe both the sisters were highly sexed. Charlotte was plain, with a sallow skin and a large nose on one side of her face. She had proposals of marriage when she was obscure and penniless, and at that period a man expected his wife to bring a portion with her. But beauty is not the only thing that makes a woman attractive; indeed, great beauty is often somewhat chilling: you admire, but are not moved. If young men fell in love with Charlotte, a captious and critical young woman, it can surely have only been because they found her sexually attractive, which means that they felt obscurely that she was highly sexed. She was not in love with Mr. Nicholls when she married him; she thought him narrow, dogmatic, sullen and far from intelligent. It is clear from her letters that after she married him she felt very differently towards him; for her they are positively skittish. She fell in love with him, and his defects ceased to matter. The most probable explanation is that those sexual desires of hers were at last satisfied. There is no reason to suppose that Emily was less highly sexed than Charlotte.

The genesis of a novel is a very curious affair. In a novelist's first novel, and Emily, so far as we know, wrote but one, it is not unlikely that there will be something of wish-fulfilment and something of imagined autobiography. It is conceivable that Wuthering Heights is the product of pure fantasy. Who can tell what erotic reveries Emily had during the long watches of her sleepless nights, or when she lay all the summer day among the flowering heather? Everybody must have noticed how strong the family likeness is between Charlotte's Rochester and Emily's Heathcliff. Heathcliff might be a by-blow, the bastard a younger son in the Rochester family might have had by an Irish biddy met in Liverpool. Both men are swarthy, violent, hard-featured, fierce, passionate and mysterious. They differ only as differed the natures of the two sisters who constructed them to satisfy their urgent, thwarted desires for sexual satisfaction. But Rochester is the dream of the woman of normal instincts, who hankers to give herself to the domineering, ruthless male; Emily gave Heathcliff her own masculinity, her violence and her savage temper. But the primary model on which the sisters created these two uncouth, difficult men, was, I surmise, their father, the Rev. Patrick Brontë.

But though, as I have said, it is conceivable that Emily constructed Wuthering Heights entirely out of her own fantasies, I do not believe it. I should have thought that it was only very rarely that the fruitful idea which will give rise to a fiction, comes to an author, like a falling star, out of the blue; for the most part, it comes to him from an experience, generally emotional, of his own, or if it is told him by another, emotionally appealing; and then, his imagination in travail, character and incidents little by little grow out of it, until at length the finished work comes into being. Few people, however, know how small a hint, how trivial to all appearances an occurrence may be, that will serve to set the spark that will kindle the author's invention, when you look at the cyclamen with its heart-shaped leaves surrounding a profusion of flowers, their careless petals wearing a wilful look as though they grew at haphazard, it seems incredible that this luscious beauty, this rich colour, should have come from a seed hardly larger than a pin's head. So it may be with the productive seed that will give rise to an immortal book.

It seems to me that one only has to read Emily Brontë's poemsto guess what the emotional experience was that led her to seek release from cruel pain by writing Wuthering Heights. She wrote a good deal of verse. It is uneven; some of it is commonplace, some of it moving, some of it lovely. She seems to have been most at home with the metres of the hymns which she sang of a Sunday in the parish church at Haworth, but the commonplace metres she used do not veil the intense emotion beneath. Many of the poems belong to the Gondal Chronicles, that long history of an imaginary island with which she and Anne amused themselves when they were children, and which Emily continued to write when she was a grown woman. It may be that she found this a convenient way to deliver her tortured heart of emotions which, with her natural secretiveness, she could not have borne to set out in any other way. Other poems seem to be the direct expression of feeling. In 1845, three years before her death, she wrote a poem called The Prisoner. So far as is known, she had never read the works of any of the mystics, yet in these verses she so describes the mystical experience that it is impossible to believe that they do not tell of what she knew from personal acquaintance. She uses almost the very words that the mystics use when they describe the anguish felt on the return from union with the Infinite:

Oh dreadful is the check—intense the agony—

When the ear begins to hear, the eye begins to see;

When the pulse begins to throb, the brain to think again;

The soul to feel the flesh, and the flesh to feel the chain.

These lines surely reflect a felt, a deeply felt, experience. Why should one suppose that Emily Brontë's love poems were no more than a literary exercise? I should have thought they pointed very clearly to her having fallen in love, to her love having been repulsed, and then to her having been bitterly hurt. She wrote these particular poems when she was teaching at a girls’ school at Law Hill, near Halifax. She was nineteen. It may be that for the only time in her life she loved. It may be that the unhappiness it caused her sufficed to implant the seed in the fruitful soil of her tortured sensibility, which enabled her to create the strange book we know. But this is no more than conjecture. I can think of no other novel in which the pain, the ecstasy, the ruthlessness of love have been so powerfully set forth. Wuthering Heights has great faults, but they do not matter; they matter as little as the fallen tree-trunks, the strewn rocks, the snow-drifts which impede, but do not stem, the alpine torrent in its tumultuous course down the mountainside. You cannot liken Wuthering Heights to any other book. You can liken it only to one of those great pictures of El Greco in which in a sombre arid landscape, under clouds heavy with thunder, long, emaciated figures in contorted attitudes, spellbound by an unearthly emotion, hold their breath. A streak of lightning, flitting across the leaden sky, gives a mysterious terror to the scene.





Choice of Kipling's Best (Introduction) (1953)


In this essay it is my business to deal only with Rudyard Kipling's short stories. I am not concerned with his verse nor, except in so far as they sometimes directly affected his stories, with his political opinions.

In making a selection of them I have had to decide whether I should choose only those I most liked. In that case I should have chosen nearly all the Indian stories. For in them to my mind he was at his best. When he wrote stories about Indians and about the British in India he felt himself at home and he wrote with an ease, a freedom, a variety of invention which gave them a quality which in stories in which the subject matter was different he did not always attain. Even the slightest of them are readable. They give you the tang of the East, the smell of the bazaars, the torpor of the rains, the heat of the sun-scorched earth, the rough life of the barracks in which the occupying troops were quartered, and the other life, so English and yet so alien to the English way, led by the officers, the Indian Civilians and the swarm of minor officials who combined to administer that vast territory.

A great many years ago, when Kipling was still at the height of his popularity, I used sometimes to meet Indian Civilians and professors at Indian universities who spoke of him with something very like contempt. That was partly due to an ignoble but natural jealousy. They resented it that this obscure journalist, of no social consequence, should have achieved world-wide renown. They protested that he did not know India. Which of them did? India is not a country, it is a continent. It is true that Kipling seems to have been intimately acquainted only with the North-West. Like any other sensible writer he placed the scene of his stories in the region he knew best. His Anglo-Indian critics blamed him because he had not dealt with this and that subject which they thought important. His sympathies lay with the Muslims rather than with the Hindus. He took but a very casual interest in Hinduism and the religion which has so deep-rooted an influence on the great mass of the teeming populations of India. There were qualities in the Muslims that aroused his admiration: he seldom spoke of the Hindus with appreciation. It never seems to have occurred to him that there were among them men of erudition, distinguished scientists and able philosophers. The Bengali, for instance, to him was a coward, a muddler, a braggart, who lost his head in an emergency and shirked responsibility. This is a pity, but it was Kipling's right, as it is of every author, to deal with the subjects that appealed to him.

But I felt that if in this volume I confined myself to Kipling's Indian stories I should not give the reader a fair impression of his varied talent. I have therefore included a few stories with an English setting which have been very widely admired.

It is not to my purpose to give more biographical details of Kipling's life than seem to me useful in my consideration of his short stories. He was born in 1865 at Bombay, where his father was Professor of Architectural Sculpture. When a little more than five his parents took him with his younger sister back to England and placed the two of them in a family where, owing to the unkindness and stupidity of the woman who looked after them, they were miserably unhappy. The wretched little boy was nagged, bullied and beaten. When his mother, after some years, once more came home she was deeply shocked by what she discovered and took the two children away. At the age of twelve Kipling was sent to a school at Westward Ho! It was called the United Services College and had been recently founded to provide education at a small cost for the sons of officers who were to be prepared to go into the army. There were about two hundred boys and they were herded together in a row of lodging-houses. Now, what the school was really like has nothing to do with me; I am only concerned with the picture Kipling has drawn of it in the work of fiction to which he gave the title Stalky＆Co. A more odious picture of school life can seldom have been drawn. With the exception of the headmaster and the chaplain the masters are represented as savage, brutal, narrow-minded and incompetent. The boys, supposedly the sons of gentlemen, were devoid of any decent instincts. To the three lads with whom these stories deal Kipling gave the names of Stalky, Turkey and Beetle. Stalky was the ringleader. He remained Kipling's ideal of the gallant, resourceful, adventurous, high-spirited soldier and gentleman. Beetle was Kipling's portrait of himself. The three of them exercised their humour in practical jokes of a singular nastiness. Kipling has narrated them with immense gusto and it is only just to say that the stories are so brilliantly told that though it may give you goose flesh to read them, when you have once begun you will read them to the end. I should not have dwelt on them at all if it were not plain to me that the influence Kipling was exposed to during the four years he spent at what he called“the Coll”gained a hold on him which throughout his career he never outgrew. He was never quite able to rid himself of the impressions, the prejudices, the spiritual posture he then acquired. Indeed there is no sign that he wanted to. He retained to the end his relish for the rough and tumble, the ragging, the brutal horseplay of fourth-form schoolboys and their delight in practical jokes. It never seems to have occurred to him that the school was third-rate and the boys a rotten lot. In fact after visiting it many years later he wrote a charming account of it, in which he paid a glowing tribute to that harsh disciplinarian, his old headmaster, and expressed his gratitude for the great benefits he had received during the period he had spent under his care.

When Kipling was a little less than seventeen, his father, who was then curator of the museum at Lahore, got him a job as assistant editor of the English paper, The Civil and Military Gazette, which was published in that city, and he left school to return to India. This was in 1882. The world he entered was very different from the world we live in now. Great Britain was at the height of her power. A map showed in pink vast stretches of the earth's surface under the sovereignty of Queen Victoria. The mother country was immensely rich. The British were the world's bankers. British commerce sent its products to the uttermost parts of the earth, and their quality was generally acknowledged to be higher than those manufactured by any other nation. Peace reigned except for small punitive expeditions here and there. The army, though small, was confident (notwithstanding the reverse on Majuba Hill) that it could hold its own against any force that was likely to be brought against it. The British navy was the greatest in the world. In sport the British were supreme. None could compete with them in the games they played, and in the classic races it was almost unheard-of that a horse from abroad should win. It looked as though nothing could ever change this happy state of things. The inhabitants of these islands of ours trusted in God, and God, they were assured, had taken the British Empire under his particular protection. It is true that the Irish were making a nuisance of themselves. It is true that the factory workers were underpaid and overworked. But that seemed an inevitable consequence of the industrialisation of the country and there was nothing to do about it. The reformers who tried to improve their lot were regarded as mischievous troublemakers. It is true that the agricultural labourers lived in miserable hovels and earned a pitiful wage, but the Ladies Bountiful of the landowners were kind to them. Many of them occupied themselves with their moral welfare, sent them beef tea and calves-foot jelly when they were ill and often clothes for their children. People said there always had been rich and poor in the world and always would be, and that seemed to settle the matter.

The British travelled a great deal on the Continent. They crowded the health resorts, Spa, Vichy, Homburg, Aix-les-Bains and Baden-Baden. In winter they went to the Riviera. They built themselves sumptuous villas at Cannes and Monte Carlo. Vast hotels were erected to accommodate them. They had plenty of money and they spent it freely. They felt that they were a race apart and no sooner had they landed at Calais than it was borne in upon them that they were now among natives, not of course natives as were the Indians or the Chinese, but—natives. They alone washed, and the baths that they frequently travelled with were a tangible proof that they were not as others. They were healthy, athletic, sensible, and in every way superior. Because they enjoyed their sojourn among the natives whose habits were so curiously un-English, because, though they thought them frivolous (the French), lazy (the Italians), stupid but funny (the Germans), with the kindness of heart natural to them, they liked them. And they in turn thought that these foreigners liked them. It never entered their heads that the courtesy which they received, the bows, the smiles, the desire to please were owing to their lavish spending, and that behind their backs the“natives”mocked them for their uncouth dress, their gawkiness, their bad manners, their insolence, their silliness in letting themselves be consistently overcharged, their patronising tolerance; and it required disastrous wars for it to dawn upon them how greatly they had been mistaken. The Anglo-Indian society into which Kipling was introduced when he joined his parents at Lahore shared to the full the prepossessions and the self-complacency of their fellow-subjects in Britain.

Since his short sight prevented him from playing games, Kipling had had the leisure at school to read a great deal and to write. The headmaster seems to have been impressed by the promise he showed and had the good sense to give him the run of his own library. He wrote the stories which he afterwards published in book form as Plain Tales from the Hills during such leisure as his duties as sub-editor of The Civil and Military Gazette allowed him. To me their chief interest is in the picture they give of the society with which he was dealing. It is a devastating one. There is no sign that any of the persons he wrote about took any interest in art, literature or music. The notion seems to have been prevalent that there was something fishy about a man who took pains to learn about things Indian. Of one character Kipling wrote: “he knew as much about Indians as it is good for a man to know.”A man who was absorbed in his work appears to have been regarded with misgiving; at best he was eccentric, at worst a bore. The life described was empty and frivolous. The self-sufficiency of these people is fearful to contemplate. And what sort of people were they? They were ordinary middle-class people, who came from modest homes in England, sons and daughters of retired government servants and of parsons, doctors and lawyers. The men were empty-headed; such of them as were in the army or had been to universities had acquired a certain polish; but the women were shallow, provincial and genteel. They spent their time in idle flirtation and their chief amusement seems to have been to get some man away from another woman. Perhaps because Kipling wrote in a prudish period which made him afraid of shocking his readers, perhaps from an innate disinclination to treat of sex, though in these stories there is a great deal of philandering, it very rarely led to sexual intercourse. Whatever encouragement these women gave the men whom they attracted, when it came to a showdown they drew back. They were, in short, what is described in English by a coarse hyphenated word, and in France, more elegantly, by allumeuses.

It is surprising that Kipling, with his quick mind and wonderful power of observation, with his wide reading, should have taken these people at their face value. He was, of course, very young. Plain Tales from the Hills was published when he was only twenty-two. It is perhaps natural that, coming straight from the brutalities of Westward Ho! to the unpretentious establishment of the curator of the Lahore museum, he should have been dazzled on his first acquaintance with a society that to his inexperienced eyes had glamour. So was the little bourgeois Marcel dazzled when he first gained admittance to the exclusive circle of Madame de Guermantes. Mrs. Hauksbee was neither so brilliant nor so witty as Kipling would have us think. He reveals her essential drabness when he makes her compare a woman's voice to the grinding brakes of an underground train coming into Earl's Court station. We are asked to believe that she was a woman of fashion. If she had been she would never have gone to Earl's Court except to see an old nurse and then not by underground, but in a hansom cab.

But Plain Tales from the Hills is not only concerned with Anglo-Indian society. The volume contains stories of Indian life and stories of the soldiery. When you consider that they were written when their author was still in his teens or only just out of them they show an astonishing competence. Kipling said that the best of them were provided for him by his father. I think we may ascribe this statement to filial piety. I believe it to be very seldom that an author can make use of a story given to him ready made, as seldom indeed as a person in real life can be transferred to fiction just as he is and maintain an air of verisimilitude. Of course the author gets his ideas from somewhere, they don’t spring out of his head like Pallas-Athene from the head of her sire in perfect panoply, ready to be written down. But it is curious how small a hint, how vague a suggestion, will be enough to give the author's invention the material to work upon and enable him in due course to construct a properly disposed story. Take, for instance, the later story, The Tomb of his Ancestors. It may very well have needed no more than such a casual remark from one of the officers Kipling had known at Lahore as: “Funny chaps these natives are. There was a feller called So-and-So who was stationed up country among the Bhils, whose grandfather had kept them in order for donkeys’ years and was buried there, and they got it into their thick heads that he was a reincarnation of the old man, and he could do anything he liked with them.”That would have been quite enough to set Kipling's vivid imagination to work upon what turned out to be an amusing and delightful tale. Plain Tales from the Hills is very uneven, as indeed Kipling's work always was. That I believe to be inevitable in a writer of short stories. It is a ticklish thing to write a short story and whether it is good or bad depends on more than the author's conception, power of expression, skill in construction, invention and imagination: it depends also on luck. So the clever Japanese, taking from his little pile of seed pearls, all to his eyes indistinguishable from one another, the first that comes to hand and inserting it into the oyster, cannot tell whether it will turn into a perfect, rounded pearl or a misshapen object neither of beauty nor of value. Nor is the author a good judge of his own work. Kipling had a high opinion of The Phantom ’Rickshaw. I think if he had been more sophisticated when he wrote it, it might have occurred to him that there was more to be said in extenuation of the man's behaviour than he apprehended. It is very unfortunate that you should fall out of love with a married woman with whom you have had an affair and fall in love with someone else and want to marry her. But such things happen. And when the woman won’t accept the situation, but pursues you and waylays you and pesters you with tears and supplications it is not unnatural that at last you should grow impatient and lose your temper. Mrs. Keith-Wessington is the most persistent crampon in fiction, for even after her death she continued to harry the wretched man in her phantom ’rickshaw. Jack Pansay deserves our sympathy rather than our censure. Because a story has been difficult to write an author may well think better of it than of a story that has seemed to write itself, sometimes there is a psychological error at the basis of it which he has not noticed, and sometimes he sees in the finished story what he saw in his mind's eye when he conceived it rather than what he has presented to the reader. But we should not be surprised that Kipling sometimes wrote stories which were poor, unconvincing or trivial; we should wonder rather that he wrote so many of such excellence. He was wonderfully various.

In the essay Mr. T. S. Eliot wrote to preface his selection of Kipling's verse he seems to suggest that variety is not a laudable quality in a poet. I would not venture to dispute any opinion of Mr. Eliot's on a question in which poetry is concerned, but though variety may not be a merit in a poet, it surely is in a writer offiction. The good writer offiction has the peculiarity, shared to a degree by all men, but in him more abundant, that he has not only one self, but is a queer mixture of several, or, if that seems an extravagant way of putting it, that there are several, often discordant aspects of his personality. The critics could not understand how the same man could write“Brugglesmith”and“Recessional”, and so accused him of insincerity. They were unjust. It was the self called Beetle who wrote“Brugglesmith”and the self called Yardley-Orde who wrote Recessional. When most of us look back on ourselves we can sometimes find consolation in believing that a self in us which we can only deplore has, generally through no merit of ours, perished. The strange thing about Kipling is that the self called Beetle which one would have thought increasing age and the experience of life would have caused to disintegrate, remained alive in all its strength almost to his dying day.

As a child at Bombay Kipling had spoken Hindustani with his ayah and the servants as his native language and in Something of Myself he has told that when he was taken to see his parents he translated what he had to say into broken English. It may be supposed that on his return to India he quickly recovered his old knowledge of the language. In the same book he has related in terms that couldn’t be bettered how at Lahore he got the material which so soon afterwards he was to make effective use of. As a reporter“I described openings of big bridges and suchlike, which meant a night to two with the engineers; floods on railways—more nights in the wet with wretched heads of repair gangs; village festivals and consequent outbreaks of cholera or smallpox; communal riots under the shadow of the Mosque of Wazir Khan, where the patient waiting troops lay in timber-yards or side-alleys till the order came to go in and hit the crowds on the feet with the gunbutt, and the growling, flaring, creed-drunk city would be brought to hand without effusion of blood”…. Often at night“I would wander till dawn in all manner of odd places—liquor-shops, gambling-and opium-dens, which are not a bit mysterious, wayside entertainments such as puppet-shows, native dances; or in and about the narrow gullies under the Mosque of Wazir Khan for the sheer sake of looking…And there were‘wet’ nights too at the Club or one Mess, when a tableful of boys, half crazed with discomfort, but with just sense enough to stick to beer and bones which seldom betray, tried to rejoice and somehow succeeded…I got to meet the soldiery of those days in visits to Fort Lahore and, in a less degree, at Mian Mir Cantonments…. Having no position to consider, and my trade enforcing it, I could move at will in the fourth dimension. I came to realize the bare horrors of the private's life, and the unnecessary torments he endured on account of the Christian doctrine that lays it down that‘the wages of sin is death.’”

I have included in this selection two stories in which figure the three privates, Mulvaney, Learoyd and Ortheris. They have been immensely popular. I think they have the disadvantage for most readers that they are written in the peculiar dialect of the speakers. It is no easy matter to decide how far an author should go in this direction. Manifestly it would be absurd to make men like Mulvaney and Ortheris deliver themselves in the cultured language of a don at King's, but to make them speak consistently in dialect may well make a narrative tedious. Perhaps the best plan is to use the turns of phrase, the grammar and the vocabulary of the persons concerned, but to reproduce peculiarities of pronunciation so sparingly as not to incommode the reader. That was not, however, Kipling's way. He reproduced the accents of his three soldiers phonetically. No one has found fault with Learoyd's Yorkshire, which was corrected by Kipling's father, himself a Yorkshireman; but critics have claimed that neither Mulvaney's Irish nor Ortheris's cockney was real. Kipling was a master of description and could relate incident brilliantly, but it does not seem to me that his dialogue was always plausible. He put into the mouth of Ortheris expressions he could never have used and one may well ask oneself how on earth he came by a quotation from Macaulay's Lays of Ancient Rome. I cannot believe that a well-bred woman such as the Brushwood Boy's mother is supposed to be would speak to him of his father as“the pater.”Sometimes the language used by the officers and officials in Indian is unconvincingly hearty. To my mind Kipling's dialogue is only beyond reproach when he is translating into measured, dignified English the speech of Indians. The reader will remember that as a child talking with his parents he had to translate what he had to say from Hindustani into English: it may be that that was the form of speech that came most naturally to him.

In 1887 Kipling, after five years as sub-editor of The Civil and Military Gazette, was sent to Allahabad, several hundred miles to the south, to work on the much more important sister-paper, The Pioneer. The proprietors were starting a weekly edition for home, and he was given the editorship. An entire page was devoted to fiction. The Plain Tales from the Hills had been restricted to twelve hundred words, but now he was allotted sufficient space to write stories up to five thousand. He wrote“soldier tales, Indian tales, and tales of the opposite sex.”Among them were such powerful but gruesome stories as The Mark of the Beast and The Return of Imray.

The stories Kipling wrote during this period were published in six paper-covered volumes in Wheeler's Indian Railway Library, and with the money he thus earned and a commission to write travel sketches he left India for England“by way of the Far East and the United States.”This was in 1889. He had spent seven years in India. His stories had become known in England and when he arrived in London, still a very young man, he found editors eager to accept whatever he wrote. He settled down in Villiers Street, Strand. The stories he produced there are of the highest quality, a quality which later he often achieved but never surpassed. Among them are On Greenhow Hill, The Courting of Dinah Shadd, The Man Who Was, Without Benefit of Clergy and At the End of the Passage. It looks as though the new surroundings in which he found himself brought into greater vividness his recollections of India. That is a likely enough thing to happen. When an author is living in the scene of his story, perhaps among the people who have suggested the characters of his invention, he may well find himself bewildered by the mass of his impressions. He cannot see the wood for the trees. But absence will erase from his memory redundant details and inessential facts. He will get then a bird's-eye view, as it were, of his subject and so, with less material to embarrass him, can get the form into his story which completes it.

It was then too that he wrote the tale which he called“The Finest Story in the World.”It is interesting because he dealt in it, for the first time, I think, with metempsychosis. It was natural that the theme should interest him, for the belief in it is ingrained in the Hindu sensibility. It is as little a matter of doubt to the people of India as were the Virgin Birth of Christ and the Resurrection to the Christians of the thirteenth century. No one can have travelled in India without discovering how deep-rooted the belief is not only among the uneducated, but among men of culture and of experience in world affairs. One hears in conversation, or reads in the papers, of men who claim to remember something of their past lives. In this story Kipling has dealt with it with great imaginative power. He returned to it in a story which is less well-known called“Wireless.”In this he made effective use of what was then a new toy for the scientifically minded amateur to persuade the reader of the possibility that the chemist's assistant of his tale, dying of tuberculosis, might under the effect of a drug recall that past life of his in which he was John Keats. To anyone who has stood in the little room in Rome overlooking the steps that lead down to the Piazza di Spagna and seen the drawing Joseph Severn made of the emaciated, beautiful head of the dead poet, Kipling's story is wonderfully pathetic. It is thrilling to watch the dying chemist's assistant, in love too, worrying out in a trancelike state, lines that Keats wrote in The Eve of St. Agnes. It is a lovely story admirably told.

Six years later Kipling, in the entrancing tale The Tomb of his Ancestors, to which I have already referred, took up once more the theme of metempsychosis, and this time in such a way as not to outrage probability. It is the Bhils, the mountain tribes among whom the story is set, who believe that the young subaltern, its hero, is a reincarnation of his grandfather who spent many years in their midst and whose memory they still revere. Kipling never succeeded better in creating that indefinable quality which for want of a better word we call atmosphere.

After spending two years in London, years of hard work, Kipling's health broke down, and he very sensibly decided to take the rest of a long journey. He returned to England to be married and with his bride started off on a tour of the world, but financial difficulties obliged him to cut it short, and he settled down in Vermont where his wife's family had long been established. This was in the summer of 1892. He stayed there off and on till 1896. During those four years he wrote a number of stories many of which were of a quality which only he could reach. It was then that he wrote In the Rukh in which Mowgli makes his first appearance. It was a propitious inspiration, for from it sprang the two Jungle Books in which, to my mind, his great and varied gifts found their most brilliant expression. They show his wonderful talent for telling a story, they have a delicate humour and they are romantic and plausible. The device of making animals talk is as old as Aesop's fables, and for all I know much older, and La Fontaine, as we know, employed it with charm and wit, but I think no one has performed the difficult feat of persuading the reader that it is as natural for animals to speak as for human beings more triumphantly than Kipling has done in The Jungle Books. He had used the same device in the story called A Walking Delegate in which horses indulge in political discussion, but there is in the story an obviously didactic element which prevents it from being successful.

It was during these fertile years that Kipling wrote The Brushwood Boy, a story which has deeply impressed so many people that, though it is not one of my favourites, I have thought it well to print it in this selection. He availed himself in this of a notion which has attracted writers of fiction both before and after him, the notion, namely, of two persons systematically dreaming the same dreams. The difficulty of it lies in making the dreams interesting. We listen restlessly when someone at the breakfast table insists on telling us of the dream he had during the night, and a dream described on paper is apt to arouse in us the same impatience. Kipling had before done the same sort of thing, though on a smaller scale, in The Bridge-Builders. There I think he made a mistake. He had a good story to tell. It is about a flood that suddenly rushes down on a bridge over the Ganges which, after three years of strenuous labour, is on the point of completion. There is doubt in the minds of the two white men in charge of the operations whether three of the spans, still unfinished, will stand the strain, and they fear that if the stone-boats go adrift the girders will be damaged. They have received by telegram warning that the flood is on the way, and with their army of workmen spend an agonized night doing what they can to strengthen the weak places. All this is described with force and the telling detail of which Kipling was a master. The bridge stands the strain and all is well. That is all. It may be that Kipling thought it wasn’t enough. Findlayson, the chief engineer, has been too anxious and too fully occupied to bother about eating anything and by the second night is all in. His lascar aide persuades him to swallow some opium pills. Then news comes that a wire hawser has snapped and the stone-boats are loose. Findlayson and the lascar rush down to the bank and get into one of the stone-boats in the hope of preventing them from doing irreparable injury. The pair are swept down the river and landed half-drowned on an island. Exhausted and doped they fall asleep and dream the same dream in which they see the Hindu Gods in animal form, Ganesh the elephant, Hanuman the ape and finally Krishna himself, and hear them talk. When the two wake in the morning they are rescued. But the double dream is needless and because the conversation of the Gods is needless too it is tedious.

In The Brushwood Boy the identical dreams are an essential element in the story. It is here for the reader to read and I hope he will agree with me that Kipling has described these dreams with felicity. They are strange, romantic, frightening and mysterious. The long series of dreams which these two people have shared from their childhood seems, though you don’t quite know why, so significant of something of high import that it is somewhat of a disappointment that such amazing occurrences should result in no more than“boy meets girl.”It is of course the same difficulty that confronts the reader of the first part of Goethe's Faust. It seems hardly worth while for Faust to have bartered his soul to see Mephistopheles do conjuring tricks in a wine-cellar and to effect the seduction of a lowly maid. I find it difficult to look upon The Brushwood Boy as one of Kipling's best stories. The persons concerned in it are really too good to be true. The Brushwood Boy is heir to a fine estate. He is idolized by his parents, by the keeper who taught him to shoot, by the servants, by the tenants. He is a good shot, a good rider, a hard worker, a brave soldier adored by his men, and after a battle on the North-West Frontier is awarded a D.S.O. and becomes the youngest major in the British army. He is clever, sober and chaste. He is perfect and incredible. But though I carp I cannot deny that it remains a good and moving story admirably told. One must look upon it not as a tale that has any relation to real life, but as much of a fairy story as The Sleeping Beauty or Cinderella.

It was on his short periods of leave that Kipling came to know that Anglo-Indian society which he wrote about in Plain Tales from the Hills, but his experiences as a reporter, so well set forth in the passage I quoted earlier in this essay, surely made it plain to him that in those little stories he had described but one aspect of Anglo-Indian life. What he saw on his various assignments deeply impressed him. I have already spoken of The Bridge-Builders with its fine account of those men who on little pay, with small chance of recognition, gave their youth, their strength, their health to do to the best of their ability the job it was their business to do. In the unfortunately named William the Conqueror Kipling has written a tale in which he shows how two or three ordinary, rather commonplace men, and a woman, the William of the story, fought a disastrous famine all through the hot weather and saved a horde of children from dying of starvation. It is a tale of selfless, stubborn tenacity soberly narrated. In these two stories and in several more, Kipling has told of the obscure men and women who devoted their lives to the service of India. They made many mistakes, for they were but human. Many were stupid. Many were hidebound with prejudice. Many were unimaginative. They kept the peace. They administered justice. They built the roads, the bridges, the railways. They fought famine, flood and pestilence. They treated the sick. It remains to be seen whether those who have succeeded them, not in high place, but in those modest situations in the hands of whose occupants the lot of the common man depends will make as good a job of it as they did.

William the Conqueror is not only the story of a famine; it is a love story as well. I have mentioned the fact that Kipling seems to have shied away, like an unbroken colt, from any treatment of sex. In the Mulvaney stories he makes casual reference to the amours of the soldiery and in Something of Myself he has an indignant passage in which he remarks on the stupid and criminal folly of the authorities who counted it impious“that bazaar prostitutes should be inspected; or that the men should be taught elementary precautions in their dealings with them. This official virtue cost our army in India nine thousand expensive white men a year always laid up from venereal disease.”But he is concerned then not with love, but with an instinct of normal man that demands its satisfaction. I can only remember two stories in which Kipling has attempted (successfully) to represent passion. One is“Love-o’-Women, ”which for this reason I have inserted in this book. It is a terrible, perhaps brutal story, but it is finely and vigorously told, and the end, mysterious and left unexplained though it be, is powerful. Critics have found fault with this end. Matisse once showed a picture of his to a visitor who exclaimed: “I’ve never seen a woman like that”, to which he replied: “It isn’t a woman, madam, it's a picture.”If the painter is permitted certain distortions to achieve the effect he is aiming at, there can be no reason why the writer of fiction should not accord himself the same freedom. Probability is not something settled once for all; it is what you can get your readers to accept as such. Kipling was not writing an official report, he was writing a story. It was his right to make it dramatically effective, if that is what he wanted to do, and if the gentleman-ranker of the story might not have said in real life to the woman he had seduced and ruined the words Kipling has put into his mouth, that is no matter. It is plausible and the reader is moved as Kipling intended him to be.

The other story in which Kipling has depicted genuine passion is Without Benefit of Clergy. It is a beautiful and pathetic tale. If I had to choose for an anthology the best story Kipling ever wrote, this I believe is the one I would choose. Other stories are more characteristic, The Head of the District, for instance, but in this one he has come as near as the medium allows to what the story-teller aims at, but can hardly hope to achieve—perfection.

I have been led to write the above on account of the love scene which gives William the Conqueror its happy ending. It is strangely embarrassing. The two persons concerned are in love with one another; that is made clear; but there is nothing of ecstasy in their love, it is a rather humdrum affair, with already a kind of domestic quality about it. They are two very nice sensible people who will make a good job of married life. The love scene is adolescent. You would expect a schoolboy home for the holidays to talk like that with the local doctor's young daughter, not two grown, efficient persons who have just gone through a harrowing and dangerous experience.

As a rough generalization I would suggest that an author reaches the height of his powers when he is between thirty-five and forty. It takes him till then to learn what Kipling made a point of calling his trade. Till then his work is immature, tentative and experimental. By profiting by past mistakes, by the mere process of living, which brings him experience and a knowledge of human nature, by discovering his own limitations and learning what subjects he is competent to deal with and how best to deal with them, he acquires command over his medium. He is in possession of such talent as he has. He will produce the best work he is capable of for perhaps fifteen years, for twenty if he is lucky, and then his powers gradually dwindle. He loses the vigour of imagination which he had in his prime. He has given all he had to give. He will go on writing, for writing is a habit easy to contract, but hard to break, but what he writes will be only an increasingly pale reminder of what he wrote at his prime.

It was different with Kipling. He was immensely precocious. He was in full possession of his powers almost from the very beginning. Some of the stories in Plain Tales from the Hills are so trivial that later in life he would probably not have thought them worth writing, but they are told clearly, vividly and effectively. Technically there is no fault to find with them. Such faults as they have are owing to the callowness of his youth and not to his want of skill. And when, only just out of his teens, he was transferred to Allahabad and was able to express himself at greater length he wrote a series of tales which can justly be described as masterly. On his first arrival in London, the editor of Macmillan's Magazine, whom he had gone to see, asked him how old he was. It is no wonder that when Kipling told him that in a few months he would be twenty-four, he cried‘My God!’ His accomplishment by then was truly amazing.

But all things have to be paid for in this world. By the end of the century, that is by the time Kipling was thirty-five, he had written his best stories. I do not mean that after that he wrote bad stories, he couldn’t have done that if he’d tried, they were well enough in their way, but they lacked the magic with which the early Indian stories had been infused. It was only when, returning in fancy to the scene of his early life in India, he wrote Kim, that he regained it. Kim is his masterpiece. It must seem strange at first that Kipling after leaving Allahabad never went back to India except for a short visit to his parents at Lahore. After all it was his Indian stories that had brought him his immense fame. He himself called it notoriety, but it was fame. I can only suppose that he felt India had given him all the subjects he could deal with. Once, after he had spent a period in the West Indies he sent me a message to say that I should do well to go there, for there were plenty of stories to be written about the people of the islands, but they were not the sort of stories he could write. He must have felt that there were plenty of stories in India besides those he had written, but that they too were not the sort of stories he could write. For him the vein was worked out.

The Boer War came to pass and Kipling went to South Africa. In India he had conceived a boyish, touching if rather absurd admiration for the officers with whom he was brought in contact. But these gallant gentlemen who cut so fine a figure on the polo field, at gymkhanas, dances and picnics, showed a horrifying incapacity when it came to waging a war very different from the punitive expeditions they had conducted on the North-West Frontier. Officers and men were as brave as he had always thought them, but they were ill led. He surveyed the muddle of that unhappy war with consternation. Did he see that this was the first rent in that great fabric, the British Empire, which was his pride and to the awareness of which he had done so much, in verse and prose, to awaken his fellow-subjects? He wrote two stories, The Captive and The Way that He Took, in which he attacked the inefficiency of the authorities at home and the incompetence of the officers in command. They are good stories, and if I have not given them a place in this volume it is because of the strong element of propaganda in them and because like all stories that have a topical interest the passage of time has deprived them of significance.

I should warn the reader that my opinion that Kipling's best stories are those of which the scene is laid in India is by no means shared by eminent critics. They think those Kipling wrote in what they call his third period show a depth, an insight and a compassion of which they deplore the lack in his Indian tales. For them the height of his achievement is to be found in such stories as An Habitation Enforced, A Madonna of the Trenches, The Wish House and Friendly Brook. An Habitation Enforced is a charming story, but surely rather obvious; and though the other three are good enough they do not seem to me remarkable. It did not need an author of Kipling's great gifts to write them. Just So Stories, Puck of Pook's Hill and Rewards and Fairies are children's books and their worth must be judged by the pleasure they afforded children. This Just So Stories must have done. One can almost hear the squeals of laughter with which they listened to the story of how the elephant got his trunk. In the two other books Puck appears to a little boy and a little girl and produces for their instruction various characters by means of whom they may gain an elementary and romantic acquaintance with English history. I don’t think this was a happy device. The stories are of course well contrived; I like best On the Great Wall, in which Parnesius, the Roman legionary, appears, but I should have liked it better if it had been a straightforward reconstruction of an episode in the Roman occupation of Britain.

The only story Kipling wrote after he settled down in England that I would on no account leave out of this selection is“They.”(In reading it you must keep in mind that his use of the House Beautiful for the country house in which the events he relates take place, reminding one of Ye Olde TeaShoppe and horrors of the same sort, had not been made obnoxious by the vulgar purveyors of whimsy and the pretty-pretty.)“They”is a fine and deeply moving effort of the imagination. In 1899 Kipling went with his wife and children to New York, and he and his elder daughter caught colds which turned into pneumonia. Those of us who are old enough can remember the world-wide concern when the cables told us that Kipling lay at death's door. He recovered, but his daughter died. It cannot be doubted that“They”was inspired by his enduring grief at her loss. Heine said: “Out of my great griefs I make these little songs.”Kipling wrote an exquisite story. Some people have found it obscure and others sentimental. One of the hazards that confront the writer offiction is the danger of slipping from sentiment into sentimentality. The distinction between the two is fine. It may be that sentimentality is merely sentiment that you don’t happen to like. Kipling had the gift of drawing tears, but sometimes, in his stories not for children, but about children, they are tears you resent, for the emotion that draws them is mawkish. There is nothing obscure in“They”and to my mind nothing sentimental.

Kipling was deeply interested in the invention and discoveries which were then transforming our civilization. The reader will remember what effective use he made of wireless in the story of that name. He was fascinated by machines and when he was fascinated by a subject he wrote stories about it. He took a great deal of trouble to get his facts right, and if sometimes he made mistakes, as all authors do, the facts were so unfamiliar to most readers that they did not know. He indulged in technical details for their own sake, not to show off, since though argumentative and self-opinionated as a man, he was modest and unassuming as an author, but for the fun of it. He was like a concert pianist rejoicing in the brilliant ease of his execution who chooses a piece not because of its musical value, but because it gives him an opportunity to exercise his special gift. In one of his stories Kipling says that he had to interrupt the narrator over and over again to ask him to explain his technical terms. The reader of these stories, and he wrote a number of them, unable to do this, remains perplexed. They would be more readable if their author had been less meticulous. In“Their Lawful Occasions, ”for instance, I surmise that only a naval officer could fully understand what goes on, and I am quite prepared to believe that he would find it a jolly good yarn. .007 is a story about a locomotive, The Ship that Found Herself, a story about an ocean tramp; I think you would have to be respectively an engine-driver and a ship-builder to read them with comprehension. In The Jungle Books, and indeed in The Maltese Cat, Kipling made the various animals concerned talk in a highly convincing manner; he used the same device in the locomotive numbered .007 and in the ship named Dimbula. I do not think with advantage. I cannot believe that the ordinary reader knows (or cares) what a garboard strake is, or a bilge-stringer, a high-pressure cylinder or a web-flame.

These stories show another side of Kipling's varied talent, but I have not thought it necessary to include any of them in this selection. The object of fiction (from the reader's standpoint from which the author's may often be very different) is entertainment; and as such to my mind their value is small.

I have been more doubtful about those stories concerned with practical joking, ragging, and drunkenness which he wrote from time to time. There was a Rabelaisian streak in him which the hypocrisy of the times, with its deliberate turning away from what are known as the facts of life, constrained him to express in the description of horseplay and inebriation. In Something of Myself he tells how he showed a story about the“opposite sex”to his mother, who“abolished it”and wrote to him: “Never you do that again.”From the context one may conclude that it dealt with adultery. Whether you find drunkenness amusing depends, I suppose, on your personal idiosyncrasies. It has been my ill-fortune to live much among drunkards, and for my part I have found them boring at their best and disgusting at their worst. But it is evident that this feeling of mine is rare. That stories dealing with drunkards have a strong allure is shown by the popularity of Brugglesmith, a crapulous ruffian, and of Pyecroft, a sottish petty officer, who amused Kipling so much that he wrote several tales about him. Practical joking, till the very recent past, seems to have had an appeal that was universal. Spanish literature of the Golden Age is full of it and everyone remembers the cruel practical jokes that were played on Don Quixote. In the Victorian Age it was still thought funny and from a recently published book we may learn that it was practised with delight in the highest circles. Here again it depends on your temperament whether it amuses you or whether it doesn’t. I must confess that I read Kipling's stories which deal with this subject with discomfort. And the hilarity which overcomes the perpetrators of the exploit grates upon me; they are not content with laughing at the humiliation of their victim; they lean against one another helpless with laughter, they roll off their chairs, they collapse shrieking, they claw the carpet; and in one story the narrator takes a room at an inn so that he may have his laugh out. There is only one of these tales that I have found frankly amusing and since I thought it only right to give the reader at least one example of this kind of story I have printed it in this volume. It is called The Village that Voted the Earth Was Flat. Here the comedy is rich, the victim deserves his punishment, and his punishment is severe without being brutal.

I have in this essay only referred casually to Kipling's success. It was enormous. Nothing like it had been seen since Dickens took the reading world by storm with The Pickwick Papers. Nor did he have to wait for it. Already in 1890 Henry James was writing to Stevenson that Kipling, “the star of the hour, ”was Stevenson's nearest rival and Stevenson was writing to Henry James that Kipling was“too clever to live.”It looks as though they were both a trifle taken aback by the appearance of this“infant monster”as James called him. They acknowledged his brilliant parts, but with reservations.“He amazes me by his precocity and various endowment, ”wrote Stevenson.“But he alarms me by his copiousness and haste...I was never capable of—and surely never guilty of—such a debauch of production…I look on, I admire, I rejoice for myself; but in a kind of ambition we all have for our tongue and literature I am wounded….Certainly Kipling has gifts; the fairy godmothers were all tipsy at his christening: what will he do with them?”

But copiousness is not a defect in a writer; it is a merit. All the greatest authors have had it. Of course not all their production is of value; only the mediocre can sustain a constant level. It is because the great authors wrote a great deal that now and then they produced great works. Kipling was no exception. I don’t believe any writer is a good judge of the writing of his contemporaries, for he naturally likes best the sort of thing he does himself. It is difficult for him to appreciate merits that he does not possess. Stevenson and James were not ungenerous men and they recognized Kipling's great abilities, but from what we know of them we can guess how disconcerted they were by the boisterous exuberance and the sentimentality of some of his tales and the brutality and grimness of others.

Of course Kipling had his detractors. The plodding writers who after years of labour had achieved but a modest place in the literary world found it hard to bear that this young man, coming from nowhere, without any of the social graces, should win, apparently with little effort, so spectacular a success; and as we know, they consoled themselves by prophesying (as once before they had of Dickens) that as he had come up like a rocket he would go down like the stick. It was objected to Kipling that he put too much of himself into his stories. But when you come down to brass tacks what else has an author to give you but himself? Sometimes, like Sterne for instance, or Charles Lamb, he gives you himself with a beguiling frankness, it is both the inspiration and the mainstay of his creativity; but even though he tries his best to be objective what he writes is inevitably infused with his ego. You cannot read a dozen pages of Madame Bovary without receiving a strong impression of Flaubert's irascible, pessimistic, morbid and self-centred personality. Kipling's critics were wrong to blame him for introducing his personality into his stories. What they meant of course was that they did not like the personality he presented to them; and that is understandable. In his early work he exhibited characteristics which were offensive. You received the impression of a bumptious, arrogant young man, extravagantly cock-sure and knowing; and this necessarily excited the antagonism of his critics. For such an assumption of superiority as these rather unamiable traits indicate affronts one's self-esteem.

Kipling was widely accused of vulgarity: so were Balzac and Dickens; I think only because they dealt with aspects of life that offended persons of refinement. We are tougher now: when we call someone refined we do not think we are paying him a compliment. But one of the most absurd charges brought against him was that his stories were anecdotes, which the critics who made it thought was to condemn him (as they sometimes still do); but if they had troubled to consult the Oxford Dictionary they would have seen that a meaning it gives to the word is: “The narration of a detached incident, or of a single event, told as being in itself interesting or striking.”That is a perfect definition of a short story. The story of Ruth, the story of the Matron of Ephesus, Boccaccio's story of Federigo degli Alberighi and his falcon are all anecdotes. So are Boule de Suif, La Parure and L’Héritage. An anecdote is the bony structure of a story which gives it form and coherence and which the author clothes with flesh, blood and nerves. No one is obliged to read stories, and if you don’t like them unless there is something in them more than a story, there is nothing to do about it. You may not like oysters, no one can blame you for that, but it is unreasonable to condemn them because they don’t possess the emotional quality of a beefsteak and kidney pudding. It is equally unreasonable to find fault with a story because it is only a story. That is just what some of Kipling's detractors have done. He was a very talented man, but not a profound thinker—indeed I cannot think of any great novelist who was; he had a consummate gift for telling a certain kind of story and he enjoyed telling it. He was wise enough for the most part to do what he could do best. As he was a sensible man, he was no doubt pleased when people liked his stories and took it with a shrug of the shoulders when they didn’t.

Another fault found with him was that he had little power of characterization. I don’t think the critics who did this quite understood the place of characterization in a short story. Of course you can write a story with the intention of displaying a character. Flaubert did it in Un Coeur Simple and Chekhov in The Darling, which Tolstoi thought so well of; though a purist might object that they are not short stories, but potted novels. Kipling was concerned with incident. In a tale so concerned you need only tell enough about the persons who take part in it to bring them to life; you show them at the moment you are occupied with; they are inevitably static. To show the development of character an author needs the passage of time and the elbow-room of a novel. Perhaps the most remarkable character in fiction is Julien Sorel, but how could Stendhal have shown the development of his complicated character in a short story? Now, I suggest that Kipling drew his characters quite firmly enough for his purpose. There is a distinction to be made between“characters”and character. Mulvaney, Ortheris and Learoyd are“characters.”It is easy enough to create them. Findlayson in The Bridge-Builders, and Scott and William in William the Conqueror have character; and to delineate that is much more difficult. It is true that they are very ordinary, commonplace people, but that gives point to the narrative, and surely Kipling was well aware of it. The father and mother of the Brushwood Boy are not, as Kipling thought, “County, ”landed gentry living on an ancestral estate, but a nice, worthy couple from Arnold Bennett's Five Towns who, after amassing a competence, had settled down in the country. Though lightly sketched, they are alive, recognizable human beings. Mrs. Hauksbee was not the fashionable and distinguished creature he thought her, she was a rather second-rate little woman with a very good opinion of herself, but she is far from a lay-figure. We have all met her. Yardley-Orde in The Head of the District dies four pages after the story opens, but so sufficiently has Kipling characterized him that anyone could write his life-history, after the pattern of one of Aubrey's Lives, with a very fair chance that it would be accurate. I hurry on so that I may not yield to the temptation of writing it here and now to show how easily it could be done.

A distinguished author not long ago told me that he disliked Kipling's style so much that he could not read him. The critics of his own day seem to have found it abrupt, jerky and mannered. One of them said that“it must be insisted that slang is not strength, nor does the abuse of the full stop ensure crispness.”True. An author uses slang to reproduce conversation accurately and in the course of his narrative to give his prose a conversational air. The chief objection to it is that its vogue is transitory and in a few years it is dated and may even be incomprehensible. Sometimes of course it passes into the language and then gains a literary validity so that not even a purist can object to its use. Kipling wrote in shorter sentences than were at that time usual. That can no longer surprise us, and since the lexicographers tell us that a sentence is a series of words, forming the grammatically complete expression of a single thought, there seems no reason why, when an author has done just this, he should not point the fact with a full stop. He is indeed right to do so. George Moore, no lenient critic of his contemporaries, admired Kipling's style for its sonority and its rhythm.“Others have written more beautifully, but no one that I can call to mind has written so copiously…. He writes with the whole language, with the language of the Bible, and with the language of the street.”Kipling's vocabulary was rich. He chose his words, often very unexpected words, for their colour, their precision, their cadence. He knew what he wanted to say and said it incisively. His prose, with which alone I am concerned, had pace and vigour. Like every other author he had his mannerisms. Some, like his unseemly addiction to biblical phrases, he quickly discarded; others he retained. He continued throughout his life to begin a sentence with a relative. Which was a pity. He continued to make deplorable use of the poetic ere when it would have been more natural to say before. Once at least he wrote e’en for even. These are minor points. Kipling has so made his style his own that I don’t suppose anyone to-day would care to write like him, even if he could, but I don’t see how one can deny that the instrument he constructed was admirably suited to the purpose to which he put it. He seldom indulged in long descriptions, but with his seeing eye and quick perception he was able by means of this instrument to put before the reader with extreme vividness the crowded Indian scene in all its fantastic variety.

If in this essay I have not hesitated to point out what seemed to me Kipling's defects, I hope I have made it plain how great I think were his merits. The short story is not a form of fiction in which the English have on the whole excelled. The English, as their novels show, are inclined to diffuseness. They have never been much interested in form. Succinctness goes against their grain. But the short story demands form. It demands succinctness. Diffuseness kills it. It depends on construction. It does not admit of loose ends. It must be complete in itself. All these qualities you will find in Kipling's stories when he was at his magnificent best, and this, happily for us, he was in story after story. Rudyard Kipling is the only writer of short stories our country has produced who can stand comparison with Guy de Maupassant and Chekhov. He is our greatest story writer. I can’t believe he will ever be equalled. I am sure he can never be excelled.





The Complete Short Stories of W. Somerset Maugham Volume I—East and West (Preface) (1921—1952)


This book contains thirty stories. They are all about the same length and on the same scale. The first was written in 1919 and the last in 1931. Though in early youth I had written a number of short stories, for a long time, twelve or fifteen years at least, occupied with the drama, I had ceased to do so; and when a journey to the South Seas unexpectedly provided me with themes that seemed to suit this medium, it was as a beginner of over forty that I wrote the story which is now called Rain. Since it caused some little stir the reader of this preface will perhaps have patience with me if I transcribe the working notes, made at the time, on which it was constructed. They are written in hackneyed and slipshod phrases, without grace; for nature has not endowed me with the happy gift of hitting instinctively upon the perfect word to indicate an object and the unusual but apt adjective to describe it. I was travelling from Honolulu to Pago Pago and, hoping they might at some time be of service, I jotted down as usual my impressions of such of my fellow-passengers as attracted my attention. This is what I said of Miss Thompson: “Plump, pretty in a coarse fashion, perhaps not more than twenty-seven. She wore a white dress and a large white hat, long white boots from which the calves bulged in cotton stockings.”There had been a raid on the Red Light district in Honolulu just before we sailed and the gossip of the ship spread the report that she was making the journey to escape arrest. My notes go on: “W. The Missionary. He was a tall thin man, with long limbs loosely jointed, he had hollow cheeks and high cheek bones, his fine, large, dark eyes were deep in their sockets, he had full sensual lips, he wore his hair rather long. He had a cadaverous air and a look of suppressed fire. His hands were large, with long fingers, rather finely shaped. His naturally pale skin was deeply burned by the tropical sun. Mrs. W. His Wife. She was a little woman with her hair very elaborately done, New England; not prominent blue eyes behind gold-rimmed pince-nez, her face was long like a sheep's, but she gave no impression of foolishness, rather of extreme alertness. She had the quick movements of a bird. The most noticeable thing about her was her voice, high, metallic, and without inflection; it fell on the ear with a hard monotony, irritating to the nerves like the ceaseless clamour of a pneumatic drill. She was dressed in black and wore round her neck a gold chain from which hung a small cross.”She told me that W. was a missionary on the Gilberts and his district consisting of widely separated islands he frequently had to go distances by canoe. During this time she remained at headquarters and managed the mission. Often the seas were very rough and the journeys were not without peril. He was a medical missionary. She spoke of the depravity of the natives in a voice which nothing could hush, but with a vehement, unctuous horror, telling me of their marriage customs which were obscene beyond description. She said, when first they went it was impossible to find a single good girl in any of the villages. She inveighed against dancing. I talked with the missionary and his wife but once, and with Miss Thompson not at all. Here is the note for the story: “A prostitute, flying from Honolulu after a raid, lands at Pago Pago. There lands there also a missionary and his wife. Also the narrator. All are obliged to stay there owing to an outbreak of measles. The missionary finding out her profession persecutes her. He reduces her to misery, shame, and repentance, he has no mercy on her. He induces the governor to order her return to Honolulu. One morning he is found with his throat cut by his own hand and she is once more radiant and self-possessed. She looks at men and scornfully exclaims: ‘dirty pigs.’”

An intelligent critic, who combines wide reading and a sensitive taste with a knowledge of the world rare among those who follow his calling, has found in my stories the influence of Guy de Maupassant. That is not strange. When I was a boy he was considered the best short story writer in France and I read his works with avidity. From the age of fifteen whenever I went to Paris I spent most of my afternoons poring over the books in the galleries of the Odéon I have never passed more enchanted hours. The attendants in their long smocks were indifferent to the people who sauntered about looking at the books and they would let you read for hours without bothering. There was a shelf filled with the works of Guy de Maupassant, but they cost three francs fifty a volume and that was not a sum I was prepared to spend. I had to read as best I could standing up and peering between the uncut pages. Sometimes when no attendant was looking I would hastily cut a page and thus read more conveniently. Fortunately some of them were issued in a cheap edition at seventy-five centimes and I seldom came away without one of these. In this manner, before I was eighteen, I had read all the best stories. It is natural enough that when at that age I began writing stories myself I should unconsciously have chosen those little masterpieces as a model. I might very well have hit upon a worse.

Maupassant's reputation does not stand as high as it did, and it is evident now that there is much in his work to repel. He was a Frenchman of his period in violent reaction against the romantic age which was finishing in the saccharine sentimentality of Octave Feuillet (admired by Matthew Arnold) and in the impetuous slop of George Sand. He was a naturalist, aiming at truth at all costs, but the truth he achieved looks to us now a trifle superficial. He does not analyze his characters. He takes little interest in the reason why. They act, but wherefore he does not know.“For me, ”he says, “psychology in a novel or in a story consists in this: to show the inner man by his life.”That is very well, that is what we all try to do, but the gesture will not by itself always indicate the motive. The result with Maupassant was a simplification of character which is effective enough in a short story, but on reflection leaves you unconvinced. There is more in men than that, you say. Again, he was obsessed by the tiresome notion, common then to his countrymen, that it was a duty a man owed himself to hop into bed with everywoman under forty that he met. His characters indulge their sexual desire to gratify their self-esteem. They are like the people who eat caviar when they are not hungry because it is expensive. Perhaps the only human emotion that affects his characters with passion is avarice. This he can understand; it fills him with horror, but notwithstanding he has a sneaking sympathy with it. He was slightly common. But for all this it would be foolish to deny his excellence. An author has the right to be judged by his best work. No author is perfect. You must accept his defects; they are often the necessary complement of his merits; and this may be said in gratitude to posterity that it is very willing to do this. It takes what is good in a writer and is not troubled by what is bad. It goes so far sometimes, to the confusion of the candid reader, as to claim a profound significance for obvious faults. So you will see the critics (the awe-inspiring voice of posterity)find subtle reasons to explain to his credit something in a play of Shakespeare's that any dramatist could tell them needed no other explanation than haste, indifference or wilfulness. Maupassant's stories are good stories. The anecdote is interesting apart from the narration so that it would secure attention if it were told over the dinner-table; and that seems to me a very great merit indeed. However halting your words and insipid your rendering, you could not fail to interest your listeners if you told them the bare story of Boule de Suif, L’H ritage or La Parure. These stories have a beginning, a middle and an end. They do not wander along an uncertain line so that you cannot see whither they are leading, but follow without hesitation, from exposition to climax, a bold and vigorous curve. It may be that they have no great spiritual significance. Maupassant did not aim at that. He looked upon himself as a plain man; no good writer was ever less a man of letters. He did not pretend to be a philosopher, and here he was well-advised, for when he indulges in reflection he is commonplace. But within his limits he is admirable. He has an astonishing capacity for creating living people. He can afford little space, but in a few pages can set before you half a dozen persons so sharply seen and vividly described that you know all about them that you need. Their outline is clear; they are distinguishable from one another; and they breathe the breath of life. They have no complexity, they lack strangely the indecision, the unexpectedness, the mystery that we see in human beings; they are in fact simplified for the purposes of the story. But they are not deliberately simplified: those keen eyes of his saw clearly, but they did not see profoundly; it is a happy chance that they saw all that was necessary for him to achieve the aim he had in view. He treats the surroundings in the same way, he sets his scene accurately, briefly and effectively; but whether he is describing the charming landscape of Normandy or the stuffy, overcrowded drawing-rooms of the eighties his object is the same, to get on with the story. On his own lines I do not think that Maupassant is likely to be surpassed. If his excellence is not at the moment so apparent it is because what he wrote must now stand comparison with the very different, more subtle and moving work of Chekhov.

His stories are the models that young writers naturally take. This is understandable. On the face of it, it is easier to write stories like Chekhov's than stories like Maupassant's. To invent a story interesting in itself apart from the telling is a difficult thing, the power to do it is a gift of nature, it cannot be acquired by taking thought, and it is a gift that very few people have. Chekhov had many gifts, but not this one. If you try to tell one of his stories you will find that there is nothing to tell. The anecdote, stripped of its trimmings, is insignificant and often inane. It was grand for people who wanted to write a story and couldn’t think of a plot to discover that you could very well manage without one. If you could take two or three persons, describe their mutual relations and leave it at that, why then it wasn’t so hard to write a story; and if you could flatter yourself that this really was art, what could be more charming?

But I am not quite sure that it is wise to found a technique on a writer's defects. I have little doubt that Chekhov would have written stories with an ingenious, original and striking plot if he had been able to think of them. It was not in his temperament. Like all good writers he made a merit of his limitations. Was it not Goethe who said that an artist only achieves greatness when he recognizes them? If a short story is a piece of prose dealing with more or less imaginary persons no one wrote better short stories than Chekhov. If, however, as some think, it should be the representation of an action, complete in itself and of a certain limited length, he leaves something to be desired. He put his own idea clearly enough in these words: “Why write about a man getting into a submarine and going to the North Pole to reconcile himself to the world, while his beloved at that moment throws herself with a hysterical shriek from the belfry? All this is untrue and does not happen in real life. One must write about simple things: how Peter Semionovitch married Maria Ivanovna. That is all.”But there is no reason why a writer should not make a story of an unusual incident. The fact that something happens every day does not make it more important. The pleasure of recognition, which is the pleasure thus aimed at, is the lowest of the aesthetic pleasures. It is not a merit in a story that it is undramatic. Maupassant chose very ordinary people and sought to show what there was of drama in the common happenings of their lives. He chose the significant incident and extracted from it all the drama possible. It is a method as praiseworthy as another; it tends to make a story more absorbing. Probability is not the only test; and probability is a constantly changing thing. At one time it was accepted that the“call of the blood”should enable long-lost children to recognize their parents and that a woman only had to get into men's clothes to pass as a man. Probability is what you can get the readers of your time to swallow. Nor did Chekhov, notwithstanding his principles, adhere to his canon unless it suited him. Take one of the most beautiful and touching of his stories, The Bishop. It describes the approach of death with great tenderness, but there is no reason for the Bishop to die, and a better technician would have made the cause of death an integral part of the story.“Everything that has no relation to the story must be ruthlessly thrown away, ”he says in his advice to Schoukin.“If in the first chapter you say that a gun hung on the wall, in the second or third chapter it must without fail be discharged.”So when the Bishop eats some tainted fish and a few days later dies of typhoid we may suppose that it was the tainted fish that killed him. If that is so he did not die of typhoid, but of ptomaine poisoning, and the symptoms were not as described. But of course Chekhov did not care. He was determined that his good and gentle bishop should die and for his own purposes he wanted him to die in a particular way. I do not understand the people who say of Chekhov's stories that they are slices of life, I do not understand, that is, if they mean that they offer a true and typical picture of life. I do not believe they do that, nor do I believe they ever did. I think they are marvellously lifelike, owing to the writer's peculiar talent, but I think they are deliberately chosen to square with the prepossessions of a sick, sad and overworked, gray-minded man. I do not blame them for that. Every writer sees the world in his own way and gives you his own picture of it. The imitation of life is not a reasonable aim of art; it is a discipline to which the artist from time to time subjects himself when the stylization of life has reached an extravagance that outrages common sense. For Chekhov life is like a game of billiards in which you never pot the red, bring off a losing hazard or make a cannon, and should you by a miraculous chance get a fluke you will almost certainly cut the cloth. He sighs sadly because the futile do not succeed, the idle do not work, liars do not speak the truth, drunkards are not sober and the ignorant have no culture. I suppose that it is this attitude that makes his chief characters somewhat indistinct. He can give you a striking portrait of a man in two lines, as much as can be said of anyone in two lines to set before you a living person, but with elaboration he seems to lose his grasp of the individual. His men are shadowy creatures, with vague impulses to good, but without will-power, shiftless, untruthful, fond of fine words, often with great ideals, but with no power of action. His women are lachrymose, slatternly and feeble-minded. Though they think it a sin they will commit fornication with anyone who asks them, not because they have passion, not even because they want to, but because it is too much trouble to refuse. It is only in his description of young girls that he seems touched with a tender indulgence.“Alas! regardless of their doom, the little victims play.”He is moved by their charm, the gaiety of their laughter, their ingenuousness and their vitality; but it all leads to nothing. They make no effort to conquer their happiness, but yield passively to the first obstacle in the way.

But if I have ventured to make these observations I beg the reader not to think that I have anything but a very great admiration for Chekhov. No writer, I repeat, is faultless. It is well to admire him for his merits. Not to recognize his imperfections, but rather to insist that they are excellencies, can in the long run only hurt his reputation. Chekhov is extremely readable. That is a writer's supreme virtue and one upon which sufficient stress is often not laid. He shared it with Maupassant. Both of them were professional writers who turned out stories at more or less regular intervals to earn their living. They wrote as a doctor visits his patients or a solicitor sees his clients. It was part of the day's work. They had to please their readers. They were not always inspired, it was only now and then that they produced a masterpiece, but it is very seldom that they wrote anything that did not hold the reader's attention to the last line. They both wrote for papers and magazines. Sometimes a critic will describe a book of short stories as magazine stories and thus in his own mind damn them. That is foolish. No form of art is produced unless there is a demand for it and if newspapers and magazines did not publish short stories they would not be written. All stories are magazine stories or newspaper stories. The writers must accept certain (but constantly changing) conditions; it has never been shown yet that a good writer was unable to write his best owing to the conditions under which alone he could gain a public for his work. That has never been anything but an excuse of the second-rate. I suspect that Chekhov's great merit of concision is due to the fact that the newspapers for which he habitually wrote could only give him a certain amount of space. He said that stories should have neither a beginning nor an end. He could not have meant that literally. You might as well ask of afish that it should have neither head nor tail. It would not be afish if it hadn’t. The way Chekhov in reality begins a story is wonderfully good. He gives the facts at once, in a few lines; he has an unerring feeling for the essential statements, and he sets them down baldly, but with great precision, so that you know at once whom you have to deal with and what the circumstances are. Maupassant often started his stories with an introduction designed to put the reader in a certain frame of mind. It is a dangerous method only justified by success. It may be dull. It may throw the reader off the scent; you have won his interest in certain characters and then instead of being told what you would like to know about them, your interest is claimed for other people in other circumstances. Chekhov preached compactness, in his longer stories he did not always achieve it. He was distressed by the charge brought against him that he was indifferent to moral and sociological questions and when he had ample space at his command he seized the opportunity to show that they meant as much to him as to any other right-thinking person. Then in long and somewhat tedious conversations he would make his characters express his own conviction that, whatever the conditions of things might be then, at some not far distant date (say 1934) the Russians would be free, tyranny would exist no longer, the poor would hunger no more and happiness, peace and brotherly love rule in the vast empire. But these were aberrations forced upon him by the pressure of opinion (common in all countries) that the writer of fiction should be a prophet, a social reformer and a philosopher. In his shorter stories Chekhov attained the concision he aimed at in a manner that is almost miraculous.

And no one had a greater gift than he for giving you the intimate feeling of a place, a landscape, a conversation or (within his limited range) a character. I suppose this is what people mean by the vague word atmosphere. Chekhov seems to have achieved it very simply, without elaborate explanation or long description, by a precise narration of facts; and I think it was due with him to a power of seeing things with amazing naivety. The Russians are a semi-barbarous people and they seem to have retained the power of seeing things naturally, as though they existed in a vacuum; while we in the West, with our complicated culture behind us, see things with the associations they have gathered during long centuries of civilization. They almost seem to see the thing in itself. Most writers, especially those living abroad, have in the last few years been shown numbers of stories by Russian refugees who vainly hope to earn a few guineas by placing them somewhere. Though dealing with the present day they might very well be stories by Chekhov not at his best; they all have that direct, sincere vision. It is a national gift. In no one was it more acutely developed than in Chekhov.

But I have not yet pointed out what to my mind is Chekhov's greatest merit. Since I am not a critic and do not know the proper critical expressions I am obliged to describe this as best I can in terms of my own feeling. Chekhov had an amazing power of surrounding people with air so that, though he does not put them before you in the round and they lack the coarse, often brutal vitality of Maupassant's figures, they live with a strange and unearthly life. They are not lit by the hard light of common day but suffused in a mysterious grayness. They move in this as though they were disembodied spirits. It is their souls that you seem to see. The subconscious seems to come to the surface and they communicate with one another directly without the impediment of speech. Strange, futile creatures, with descriptions of their outward seeming tacked on them like a card on an exhibit in a museum, they move as mysteriously as the tortured souls who crowded about Dante when he walked in Hell. You have the feeling of a vast, gray, lost throng wandering aimless in some dim underworld. It fills you with awe and with uneasiness. I have hinted that Chekhov had no great talent for inventing a multiplicity of persons. Under different names, with different environment, the same characters recur. It is as though, when you looked at the soul, the superficial difference vanishes and everyone is more or less the same. His people seem strangely to slip into one another as though they were not distinct individuals, but temporary fictions, and as though in truth they were all part of one another. The importance of a writer in the long run rests on his uniqueness. I do not know that anyone but Chekhov has so poignantly been able to represent spirit communing with spirit. It is this that makes one feel that Maupassant in comparison is obvious and vulgar. The strange, the terrible thing is that, looking at man in their different ways, these two great writers, Maupassant and Chekhov, saw eye to eye. One was content to look upon the flesh, the other, more nobly and subtly, surveyed the spirit; but they agreed that life was tedious and insignificant and that men were base, unintelligent and pitiful.

I hope the reader will not be impatient with me because in an introduction to my own stories I have dwelt at length on these remarkable writers. Maupassant and Chekhov are the two authors of short stories whose influence survives to the present day and all of us who cultivate the medium must in the end be judged by the standards they have set.

So far as I could remember it I have placed the stories in this volume in the order in which they were written. I thought it might possibly interest the reader to see how I had progressed from the tentativeness of the first ones, when I was very much at the mercy of my anecdote, to the relative certainty of the later ones when I had learnt so to arrange my material as to attain the result I wanted. Though all but two have been published in a magazine these stories were not written with that end in view. When I began to write them I was fortunately in a position of decent independence and I wrote them as a relief from work which I thought I had been too long concerned with. It is often said that stories are no better than they are because the editors of magazines insist on their being written to a certain pattern. This has not been my experience. All but Rain and The Book-Bag were published in the Cosmopolitan magazine and Ray Long, the Editor, never put pressure on me to write other than as I wished. Sometimes the stories were cut and this is reasonable since no editor can afford one contributor more than a certain amount of space; but I was never asked to make the smallest alteration to suit what might be supposed to be the taste of the readers. Ray Long paid me for them not only with good money, but with generous appreciation. I did not value this less. We authors are simple, childish creatures and we treasure a word of praise from those who buy our wares. Most of them were written in groups from notes made as they occurred to me, and in each group I left naturally enough to the last those that seemed most difficult to write. A story is difficult to write when you do not know all about it from the beginning, but for part of it must trust to our imagination and experience. Sometimes the curve does not intuitively present itself and you have to resort to this method and that to get the appropriate line.

I beg the reader not to be deceived by the fact that a good many of these stories are told in the first person into thinking that they are experiences of my own. This is merely a device to gain verisimilitude. It is one that has its defects, for it may strike the reader that the narrator could not know all the events he sets forth; and when he tells a story in the first person at one remove, when he reports, I mean, a story that someone tells him, it may very well seem that the speaker, a police officer, for example, or a sea-captain, could never have expressed himself with such facility and with such elaboration. Every convention has its disadvantages. These must be as far as possible disguised and what cannot be disguised must be accepted. The advantage of this one is its directness. It makes it possible for the writer to tell no more than he knows. Making no claim to omniscience, he can frankly say when a motive or an occurrence is unknown to him, and thus often give his story a plausibility that it might otherwise lack. It tends also to put the reader on intimate terms with the author. Since Maupassant and Chekhov, who tried so hard to be objective, nevertheless are so nakedly personal, it has sometimes seemed to me that if the author can in no way keep himself out of his work it might be better if he put in as much of himself as possible. The danger is that he may put in too much and thus be as boring as a talker who insists on monopolizing the conversation. Like all conventions this one must be used with discretion. The reader may have observed that in the original note of Rain the narrator was introduced, but in the story as written omitted.

Three of the stories in this volume were told me and I had nothing to do but make them probable, coherent and dramatic. They are The Letter, Footprints in the Jungle and The Book-Bag. The rest were invented, as I have shown Rain was, by the accident of my happening upon persons here and there, who in themselves or from something I heard about them suggested a theme that seemed suitable for a short story. This brings me to a topic that has always concerned writers and that has at times given the public, the writer's raw material, some uneasiness. There are authors who state that they never have a living model in mind when they create a character. I think they are mistaken. They are of this opinion because they have not scrutinized with sufficient care the recollections and impressions upon which they have constructed the person who, they fondly imagine, is of their invention. If they did they would discover that, unless he was taken from some book they had read, a practice by no means uncommon, he was suggested by one or more persons they had at one time known or seen. The great writers of the past made no secret of the fact that their characters were founded on living people. We know that the good Sir Walter Scott, a man of the highest principles, portrayed his father, with sharpness first and then, when the passage of years had changed his temper, with tolerance; Henri Beyle, in the manuscript of at least one of his novels, has written in at the side the names of the real persons who were his models; and this is what Turgenev himself says: “For my part, I ought to confess that I never attempted to create a type without having, not an idea, but a living person, in whom the various elements were harmonized together, to work from. I have always needed some groundwork on which I could treadfirmly.”With Flaubert it is the same story; that Dickens used his friends and relations freely is notorious; and if you read the Journal of Jules Renard, a most instructive book to anyone who wishes to know how a writer works, you will see the care with which he set down every little detail about the habits, ways of speech and appearance of the persons he knew. When he came to write a novel he made use of this storehouse of carefully collected information. In Chekhov's diary you will find notes which were obviously made for use at some future time, and in the recollections of his friends there are frequent references to the persons who were the originals of certain of his characters. It looks as though the practice were very common. I should have said it was necessary and inevitable. Its convenience is obvious. You are much more likely to depict a character who is a recognizable human being, with his own individuality, if you have a living model. The imagination can create nothing out of the void. It needs the stimulus of sensation. The writer whose creative faculty has been moved by something peculiar in a person (peculiar perhaps only to the writer) falsifies his idea if he attempts to describe that person other than as he sees him. Character hangs together and if you try to throw people off the scent, by making a short man tall for example (as though stature had no effect on character) or by making him choleric when he has the concomitant traits of an equable temper, you will destroy the plausible harmony (to use the beautiful phrase of Baltasar Gracian) of which it consists. The whole affair would be plain sailing if it were not for the feelings of the persons concerned. The writer has to consider the vanity of the human race and the Schadenfreude which is one of its commonest and most detestable failings. A man's friends will find pleasure in recognizing him in a book and though the author may never even have seen him will point out to him, especially if it is un flattering, what they consider his living image. Often someone will recognize a trait he knows in himself or a description of the place he lives in and in his conceit jumps to the conclusion that the character described is a portrait of himself. Thus in the story called The Outstation the Resident was suggested by a British Consul I had once known in Spain and it was written ten years after his death, but I have heard that the Resident of a district in Sarawak, which I described in the story, was much affronted because he thought I had had him in mind. The two men had not a trait in common. I do not suppose any writer attempts to draw an exact portrait. Nothing, indeed, is so unwise as to put into a work of fiction a person drawn line by line from life. His values are all wrong, and, strangely enough, he does not make the other characters in the story seem false, but himself. He never convinces. That is why the many writers who have been attracted by the singular and powerful figure of the late Lord Northcliffe have never succeeded in presenting a credible personage. The model a writer chooses is seen through his own temperament and if he is a writer of any originality what he sees need have little relation with the facts. He may see a tall man short or a generous one avaricious; but, I repeat, if he sees him tall, tall he must remain. He takes only what he wants of the living man. He uses him as a peg on which to hang his own fancies. To achieve his end (the plausible harmony that nature so seldom provides) he gives him traits that the model does not possess. He makes him coherent and substantial. The created character, the result of imagination founded on fact, is art, and life in the raw, as we know, is of this only the material. The odd thing is that when the charge is made that an author has copied this person or the other from life, emphasis is laid only on his less praiseworthy characteristics. If you say of a character that he is kind to his mother, but beats his wife, everyone will cry: Ah, that's Brown, how beastly to say he beats his wife; and no one thinks for a moment of Jones and Robinson who are notoriously kind to their mothers. I draw from this the somewhat surprising conclusion that we know our friends by their vices and not by their virtues. I have stated that I never even spoke to Miss Thompson in Rain. This is a character that the world has not found wanting in vividness. Though but one of a multitude of writers my practice is doubtless common to most, so that I may be permitted to give another instance of it. I was once asked to meet at dinner two persons, a husband and wife, of whom I was told only what the reader will shortly read. I think I never knew their names. I should certainly not recognize them if I met them in the street. Here are the notes I made at the time.“A stout, rather pompous man of fifty, with pince-nez, gray-haired, a florid complexion, blue eyes, a neat gray moustache. He talks with assurance. He is resident of an outlying district and is somewhat impressed with the importance of his position. He despises the men who have let themselves go under the influence of the climate and the surroundings. He has travelled extensively during his short leaves in the East and knows Java, the Philippines, the coast of China and the Malay Peninsula. He is very British, very patriotic; he takes a great deal of exercise. He has been a very heavy drinker and always took a bottle of whisky to bed with him. His wife has entirely cured him and now he drinks nothing but water. She is a little insignificant woman, with sharp features, thin, with a sallow skin and a flat chest. She is very badly dressed. She has all the prejudices of an Englishwoman. All her family for generations have been in second-rate regiments. Except that you know that she has caused her husband to cease drinking entirely you would think her quite colourless and unimportant.”On these materials I invented the story which is called Before the Party. I do not believe that any candid person could think that these two people had cause for complaint because they had been made use of. It is true that I should never have thought of the story if I had not met them, but anyone who takes the trouble to read it will see how insignificant was the incident (the taking of the bottle to bed) that suggested it and how differently the two chief characters have in the course of writing developed from the brief sketch which was their foundation.

“Critics are like horse-flies which prevent the horse from ploughing, ”said Chekhov.“For over twenty years I have read criticisms of my stories, and I do not remember a single remark of any value or one word of valuable advice. Only once Skabichevsky wrote something which made an impression on me. He said I would die in a ditch, drunk.”He was writing for twenty-five years and during that time his writing was constantly attacked. I do not know whether the critics of the present day are naturally of a less ferocious temper; I must allow that on the whole the judgment that has been passed on the stories in this volume when from time to time a collection has been published in book form has been favourable. One epithet, however, has been much applied to them, which has puzzled me; they have been described with disconcerting frequency as“competent.”Now on the face of it I might have thought this laudatory, for to do a thing competently is certainly more deserving of praise than to do it incompetently, but the adjective has been used in a disparaging sense and, anxious to learn and if possible to improve, I have asked myself what was in the mind of the critics who thus employed it. Of course none of us is liked by everybody and it is necessary that a man's writing, which is so intimate a revelation of himself, should be repulsive to persons who are naturally antagonistic to the creature he is. This should leave him unperturbed. But when an author's work is somewhat commonly found to have a quality that is unattractive to many it is sensible of him to give the matter his attention. There is evidently something that a number of people do not like in my stories and it is this they try to express when they damn them with the faint praise of competence. I have a notion that it is the definiteness of their form. I hazard the suggestion (perhaps unduly flattering to myself) because this particular criticism has never been made in France where my stories have had with the critics and the public much greater success than they have had in England. The French, with their classical sense and their orderly minds, demand a precise form and are exasperated by a work in which the ends are left lying about, themes are propounded and not resolved and a climax is foreseen and then eluded. This precision on the other hand has always been slightly antipathetic to the English. Our great novels have been shapeless and this, far from disconcerting their readers, has given them a sense of security. This is the life we know, they have thought, with its arbitrariness and inconsequence; we can put out of our minds the irritating thought that two and two make four. If I am right in this surmise I can do nothing about it and I must resign myself to being called competent for the rest of my days. My prepossessions in the arts are on the side of law and order. I like a story that fits. I did not take to writing stories seriously till I had had much experience as a dramatist, and this experience taught me to leave out everything that did not serve the dramatic value of my story. It taught me to make incident follow incident in such a manner as to lead up to the climax I had in mind. I am not unaware of the disadvantages of this method. It gives a tightness of effect that is sometimes disconcerting. You feel that life does not dovetail into its various parts with such neatness. In life stories straggle, they begin nowhere and tail off without a point. That is probably what Chekhov meant when he said that stories should have neither a beginning nor an end. It is certain that sometimes it gives you a sensation of airlessness when you see persons who behave so exactly according to character, and incidents that fall into place with such perfect convenience. The story-teller of this kind aims not only at giving his own feelings about life, but at a formal decoration. He arranges life to suit his purposes. He follows a design in his mind, leaving out this and changing that; he distorts facts to his advantage, according to his plan; and when he attains his object produces a work of art. It may be that life slips through his fingers; then he has failed; it may be that he seems sometimes so artificial that you cannot believe him, and when you do not believe a story-teller he is done. When he succeeds he has forced you for a time to accept his view of the universe and has given you the pleasure of following out the pattern he has drawn on the surface of chaos. But he seeks to prove nothing. He paints a picture and sets it before you. You can take it or leave it.





The Complete Short Stories of W. Somerset Maugham Volume II—The World Over (Preface) (1923—1952)


This book contains all the stories I have written that are not included in East and West. The tales in that collection were of about the same length and written on the same scale and so it seemed convenient to publish them together in a single volume. Most of the stories which I have now gathered together are very much shorter. Some were written many years ago, others more recently. They appeared in magazines and were afterwards issued in book form. To the first lot I gave the title of Cosmopolitans, because they were offered to the public in the Cosmopolitan magazine, and except for Ray Long, who was then its editor, would never have been written.

When I was in China in 1920, I took notes of whatever I saw that excited my interest, with the intention of making a connected narrative out of them; but when I came home and read them it seemed to me that they had a vividness which I might easily lose if I tried to elaborate them. So I changed my mind and decided to publish them as they stood under the title: On a Chinese Screen. Ray Long chanced to read this and it occurred to him that some of my notes might well be taken for short stories. I have included two of them, “The Taipan”and“The Consul, ”in this volume. The fact is that if you are a story-teller any curious person you meet has a way of suggesting a story, and incidents that to others will seem quite haphazard have a way of presenting themselves to you with the pattern your natural instinct has impressed on them.

Magazine readers do not like starting a story and, after reading for a while, being told to turn to page one hundred and something. Writers do not like it either, for they think the interruption disturbs the reader and they have besides an uneasy fear that sometimes he will not take the trouble and so leave their story unfinished. There is no help for it. Everyone should know that a magazine costs more to produce than it is sold for, and could not exist but for the advertisements. The advertisers think that their announcements are more likely to be read if they are on the same page as matter which they modestly, but often mistakenly, think of greater interest. So in the illustrated periodicals it has been found advisable to put the beginning of a story or an article, with the picture that purports to illustrate it, at the beginning and the continuation with the advertisements later on.

Neither readers nor writers should complain. Readers get something for far less than cost price and writers are paid sums for their productions which only the advertisements render possible. They should remember that they are only there as bait. Their office is to fill blank spaces and indirectly induce their readers to buy motor accessories, aids to beauty and join correspondence courses. Fortunately this need not affect them. The best story from the advertisers’ standpoint (and they make their views felt on this question) is the story that gives readers most entertainment. Ray Long conceived the notion that the readers of the Cosmopolitan would like it if they were given at least one story that they could read without having to hunt for the continuation among the advertisements, and he commissioned me to write half a dozen sketches of the same sort as those in On a Chinese Screen. They were to be short enough to print on opposite pages of the magazine and leave plenty of room for illustration.

The sketches I wrote pleased and the commission was renewed. I went on writing them until my natural verbosity got the better of me and I found myself no longer able to keep my stories within the limits imposed upon me. Then I had to stop. I think I learned a good deal from the writing of them and I am glad that I did. My difficulty was to compress what I had to tell into a number of words which must not be exceeded and yet leave the reader with the impression that I had told all there was to tell. It was this that made the enterprise amusing. It was also salutary. I could not afford to waste a word. I had to be succinct. I was surprised to find how many adverbs and adjectives I could leave out without any harm to the matter or the manner. One often writes needless words because they give the phrase balance. It was very good practice to try to get it into a sentence without using a word that was not necessary to the sense.

The matter, of course, had to be chosen with discretion; it would have been futile to take a theme that demanded elaborate development. I have a natural predilection for completeness, so that even in the little space at my disposal I wanted my story to have a certain structure. I do not care for the shapeless story. To my mind it is not enough when the writer gives you the plain facts seen through his own eyes (which means of course that they are not plain facts, but facts coloured by his own idiosyncrasy); I think he should impose a pattern on them. Naturally these stories are anecdotes. If stories are interesting and well told they are none the worse for that. The anecdote is the basis of fiction. The restlessness of writers forces upon fiction from time to time forms that are foreign to it, but when it has been oppressed for a period by obscurity, propaganda or affectation, it reverts, and returns inevitably to the proper function of fiction, which is to tell an interesting story.

In the preface to East and West I said pretty well all I had to say about the short story in general. I have nothing to add to that. I have written now nearly a hundred stories and one thing I have discovered is that whether you hit upon a story or not, whether it comes off or not, is very much a matter of luck. Stories are lying about at every street corner, but the writer may not be there at the moment they are waiting to be picked up or he may be looking at a shop window and pass them unnoticed. He may write them before he has seen all there is to see in them or he may turn them over in his mind so long that they have lost their freshness. He may not have seen them from the exact standpoint at which they can be written to their best advantage. It is a rare and happy event when he conceives the idea of a story, writes it at the precise moment when it is ripe, and treats it in such a way as to get out of it all that it implicitly contains. Then it will be within its limitations perfect. But perfection is seldom achieved. I think a volume of modest dimensions would contain all the short stories which even closely approach it. The reader should be satisfied if in any collection of these short pieces of fiction he finds a general level of competence and on closing the book feels that he has been amused, interested and moved.

With one exception all the stories I have written have been published in magazines. The exception is a story called“The Book-Bag.”When I sent it to Ray Long he wrote to me, in sorrow rather than in anger, that he had gone further with me than with any other author, but when it came to incest he had to draw the line. I could not blame him. He published the tale later in a collection of what he thought in his long career as editor of the Cosmopolitan were the best short stories that had ever been offered him. I know that in admitting that my stories have been published in magazines I lay myself open to critical depreciation, for to describe a tale as a magazine story is to condemn it. But when the critics do this they show less acumen than may reasonably be expected of them. Nor do they show much knowledge of literary history. For ever since magazines became a popular form of publication authors have found them a useful medium to put their work before readers. All the greatest short-story writers have published their stories in magazines, Balzac, Flaubert and Maupassant; Chekhov, Henry James, Rudyard Kipling. I do not think it rash to say that the only short stories that have not been published in a magazine are the stories that no editor would accept. So to damn a story because it is a magazine story is absurd. The magazines doubtless publish a great many bad stories, but then more bad stories are written than good ones, and an editor, even of a magazine with literary pretensions, is often obliged to print a story of which he doesn’t think highly because he can get nothing better. Some editors of popular magazines think their readers demand a certain type of story and will take nothing else; and they manage to find writers who can turn out the sort of thing they want and often make a very good job of it. This is the machine-made article that has given the magazine story a bad name. But after all, no one is obliged to read it. It gives satisfaction to many people since it allows them for a brief period to experience in fancy the romance and adventure which in the monotony of their lives they crave for.

But if I may judge from the reviews I have read of the volumes of short stories that are frequently published, where the critics to my mind err is when they dismiss stories as magazine stories because they are well constructed, dramatic and have a surprise ending. There is nothing to be condemned in a surprise ending if it is the natural end of a story. On the contrary it is an excellence. It is only bad when, as in some of O. Henry's stories, it is dragged in without reason to give the reader a kick. Nor is a story any the worse for being neatly built, with a beginning, a middle and an end. All good story writers have done their best to achieve this. It is the fashion of to-day for writers, under the influence of an inadequate acquaintance with Chekhov, to write stories that begin anywhere and end inconclusively. They think it enough if they have described a mood, or given an impression, or drawn a character. That is all very well, but it is not a story, and I do not think it satisfies the reader. He does not like to be left wondering. He wants to have his questions answered. That is what I have tried to do, and when a story was suggested to me of which I didn’t know the answer I forbore to write it. One such story I wrote about in A Writer's Notebook, and since I don’t expect everyone to have read everything I have written I think it may amuse the reader if I here repeat it. When I was in India I received a letter from a man unknown to me in which he told me the following incident in the belief that I might be able to make use of it:

Two young fellows were working on a tea plantation in the hills and the mail had to be fetched from a long way off so that they only got it at rather long intervals. One of the young fellows, let us call him A, got a lot of letters by every mail, ten or twelve and sometimes more, but the other, B, never got one. He used to watch A enviously as he took his bundle and started to read; he hankered to have a letter, just one letter; and one day, when they were expecting the mail, he said to A: “Look here, you always have a packet of letters and I never get any. I’ll give you five pounds if you’ll let me have one of yours.”“Right-ho, ”said A, and when the mail came in he handed B his letters and said to him: “Take whichever you like.”B gave him a five-pound note, looked over the letters, chose one and returned the rest. In the evening when they were having whisky and soda before dinner, A asked casually: “By the way, what was that letter about?”“I’m not going to tell you, ”said B. A, somewhat taken aback, said: “Well, who was it from?”“That's my business, ”answered B. They had a bit of an argument, but B stood on his rights and refused to say anything about the letter he had bought. A began to fret, and as the weeks went by he did all he could to persuade B to let him see the letter. B continued to refuse. At length A, anxious, worried, and curious, felt he couldn’t bear it any longer, so he went to B and said: “Look here, here's your five pounds, let me have my letter back again.”“Not on your life, ”said B.“I bought it and paid for it, it's my letter and I’m not going to give it up.”

In A Writer's Notebook I added: “I suppose if I belonged to the modern school of story writers I should write it just as it is and leave it. It goes against the grain with me. I want a story to have form, and I don’t see how you can give it that unless you can bring it to a conclusion that leaves no legitimate room for questioning. But even if you could bring yourself to leave the reader up in the air you don’t want to leave yourself up in the air with him.”The facts as my correspondent gave them to me intrigued a good many people, and a magazine in Canada and The New Statesman in England, independently of one another, offered prizes to their readers for the best conclusion to the story. I don’t know that the results were particularly successful.

I read once an article on how to write a short story. Certain points the author made were useful, but to my mind the central thesis was wrong. She stated that the“focal point”of a short story should be the building of character and that the incidents should be invented solely to“liven”personality. Oddly enough she remarked earlier in her article that the parables are the best short stories that have ever been written. I think it would be difficult to describe the characters of the Prodigal Son and his brother or of the Good Samaritan and the Man who fell among thieves. They are in fact not characterized and we have to guess what sort of people they were, for we are only told about them the essential facts necessary for the pointing of the moral. And that, whether he has a moral to point or not, is about all the short-story writer can do. He has no room to describe and develop a character; at best he can only give the salient traits that bring the character to life and so make the story he has to tell plausible. Since the beginning of history men have gathered around the campfire or in a group in the market place to listen to the telling of stories. The desire to listen to them appears to be as deeply rooted in the human animal as the sense of property. I have never pretended to be anything but a storyteller. It has amused me to tell stories and I have told a great many.

I have been writing stories for fifty years. In that long period I have seen a number of bright stars creep shyly over the horizon, travel across the sky to burn with a more or less gem-like flame for a while in mid-heaven, and then dwindle into an obscurity from which there is little likelihood that they will ever emerge. The writer has his special communication to make, which, when you come to analyse it, is the personality with which he is endowed by nature, and during the early years of his activity he is groping in the dark to express it; then, if he is fortunate, he succeeds in doing this and if there is in his personality a certain abundance he may contrive for a long time to produce work which is varied and characteristic; but the time comes at last (if he is so imprudent as to live to a ripe age) when, having given what he has to give, his powers fail. He has fashioned all the stories he himself is capable of digging out of the inexhaustible mine which is human nature and he has created all the characters which can possibly be constituted out of the various sides of his own personality. For no one, I believe, can create a character from pure observation; if it is to have life it must be at least in some degree a representation of himself. A generation has arisen which is strange to him and it is only by an effort of will that he can understand the interests of a world of which he can now be only an observer. But to understand is not enough; the writer of fiction must feel, and he must not only feel with, he must feel in. It is well then if he can bring himself to cease writing stories which might just as well have remained unwritten. He is wise to watch warily for the signs which will indicate to him that having said his say, it behoves him to resign himself to silence.

I have written my last story.
