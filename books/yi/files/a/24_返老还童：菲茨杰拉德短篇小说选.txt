头和肩膀


一


一九一五年，贺拉斯·塔波克斯十三岁。那年，他参加了普林斯顿大学的入学考试，他在恺撒、西塞罗、维吉尔、色诺芬、荷马、代数、平面几何、立体几何和化学科目中全部取得优异成绩——都拿到了A。

两年后，当乔治·M.柯汉还在创作《在那里》时，贺拉斯已经在大学二年级学生中遥遥领先，并已撰写出论文《过时的学术形式三段论》。在蒂耶里堡战役期间，他坐在课桌边，思考着是否等过了十七岁生日再开始撰写论文集《新现实主义者对实用主义的偏爱》。

不久，报童告诉他，战争结束了。他很高兴，因为这意味着彼得兄弟出版社要推出斯宾诺莎的《论理解力的提高》的新版本。战争自有其美好的一面，因为它使年轻人自立自强。然而，贺拉斯觉得，他永远都无法原谅校长，因为校长允许一个铜管乐队在他的窗户下面吹吹打打地闹腾了一夜，来庆祝战争的暂时结束，使他在撰写论文《德国理想主义》时忽略了三个至关重要的句子。

第二年，他去耶鲁大学攻读文学硕士学位。

那时他十七岁，瘦高个，灰色眼睛，近视，他说出的只言片语显示出一种完全超然于世外的气度。

“我永远都觉得仿佛不是在和他本人讲话，”迪林杰教授对一个志趣相投的同事说，“他让我觉得我似乎是在和他的代理人讲话，总觉得他会说：‘噢，我请示一下我自己，看看该怎么办。’”

另外，贺拉斯·塔波克斯一副漠然失神的样子，仿佛屠夫面前的一堆牛肉或衣帽店里的一顶帽子。人来了，把他抓在手里，随便摆弄、撕扯，然后再像对待一根爱尔兰鞋带一样把他摊到礼拜六下午的廉价货柜上。

用文学语言来描述的话，我该说，这都是因为在很久以前的那个殖民时代，勇敢的先祖们来到康涅狄格这个不毛之地，彼此询问对方：“现在，我们该在这儿建点什么呢？”最勇敢的那位先祖说：“建座城吧，剧场经理可以在这里安排演出音乐喜剧！”至于后来他们又是如何在那里创建了耶鲁大学，上演音乐喜剧，便是人尽皆知的故事了。无论如何，有一年的十二月，《霍姆·詹姆斯》在舒伯特剧院上演了，玛西亚·梅朵在第一幕唱了一首歌，歌名叫《愚蠢的胖子》，并且在最后一幕跳了一支赫赫有名的舞。她浑身颤动、摇曳生姿，学生们都请求她再演一场。

玛西亚十九岁，她没有长翅膀，不过观众一致赞同她没有翅膀也很好。她天生金发碧眼，肤色红润，在赤日炎炎的正午，素面朝天地走在大街上。除此之外，她与大多数女人并无两样。

是查理·穆恩向她许下诺言，如果她去看望一下杰出的天才贺拉斯·塔波克斯，他就送她五千根波迈香烟。查理是谢菲尔德大学的四年级学生，他和贺拉斯是嫡亲的表兄弟。他们两人志趣相投、惺惺相惜。

那天晚上，贺拉斯特别忙。法国人劳里埃不能理解新现实主义的重要性，这令他闷闷不乐。事实上，对于书房外响起的低沉而清晰的敲门声，他唯一的反应就是思考这样一个问题：如果根本不想理会，任凭他怎么敲，也是枉然。他觉得自己越来越接近实用主义了。然而就在那一刻，尽管他自己还不曾意识到，他的确正在以某种令人吃惊的速度走向某种截然不同的人生。

敲门声响了起来——过了三秒钟——敲门声又响了起来。

“进来。”贺拉斯不假思索地说。

他听见门开了，然后又关上了，然而，他坐在火炉前的大圈椅里埋头看书，没有抬头。

“放在另一个房间的床上。”他心不在焉地说。

“把什么放在另一个房间的床上？”

玛西亚·梅朵不得不开口说话，她说起话来像唱歌，而她的音色清脆，犹如竖琴的伴奏曲。

“洗好的衣服。”

“我可做不到。”

贺拉斯不耐烦地在圈椅里动了动身子。

“为什么？”

“呃，因为我没有拿你的衣服呀。”

“哼！”他烦躁地回答，“那就去拿吧。”

贺拉斯面前的火炉正对着另一张安乐椅。晚上，他习惯换到这张椅子上坐着，一来改变一下坐姿，二来活络活络身体。他把一张椅子叫作伯克利，把另一张叫作休姆。他突然听到一阵窸窸窣窣的声音，一个半透明的身影轻盈地落在了休姆上。他抬头看了一眼。

“哦，”玛西亚说道，她的脸上荡漾着甜蜜的微笑，她在第二幕念台词时就是这个表情（“哦，那么，公爵喜欢我跳舞啰！”），“哦，欧玛尔·海亚姆，我来到你身旁，在荒野中唱歌。”

贺拉斯迷惑地看着她。有那么一刻，他竟怀疑坐在那里的她只是他想象中的幽灵。女人不会进男人的房间，更不会坐到男人的休姆椅子上。女人为你送来洗好的衣服，坐在有轨电车上你为她让的座位上。以后，等你年龄大了，想成个家的时候，她就会嫁给你。

这个坐在休姆椅子上的女人显然是真实存在的。她那薄如蝉翼的棕色裙子泛着涟漪，犹如从休姆的皮质扶手内溢出的一团气泡！如果再多看几眼，他的目光就会穿透她的身体看到她身后的休姆椅子。那样的话，房间里就又只剩下他孤零零的一个人了。他举起拳头在眼前晃了晃。他真得再去练练吊环了。

“看在上帝的分上，别那么不近人情！”气泡愉快地提出抗议，“我觉得你好像希望我从你这私人空间里消失似的。然后，除了在你眼中留下一道影子，我就什么都没有了。”

贺拉斯咳了一声。咳嗽是他的两个习惯性动作之一。听他说话，你会忘记他本人的存在，仿佛在听一盘某个去世已久的歌手录制的唱片。

“你想要什么？”他问。

“想要我的信，”玛西亚带着幽怨的语气夸张地说，“一八八一年，你从我祖父那里买走了我的那些信。”

贺拉斯想了想。

“我没有你的信，”他淡淡地说，“我只有十七岁。一八七九年三月三日我父亲才出生。你显然找错人了。”

“你只有十七岁吗？”玛西亚怀疑地重复了他的话。

“只有十七岁。”

“我认识一个女孩，”玛西亚回忆道，“她十六岁时加入了一个过时的话剧团。她太自恋了，每次谈到自己的年龄时，总要在‘十六岁’前加上‘只有’两个字。我们就送她一个绰号叫‘只有杰西’。她一直都是这个样子——糟透了。‘只有’是个坏习惯，欧玛尔——听起来像是某种托词。”

“我不叫欧玛尔。”

“我知道，”玛西亚点头表示赞同，“你叫贺拉斯。我就叫你欧玛尔，因为你给我的感觉像是一个剩下的烟头。”

“我没有你的信。是否见过你祖父也值得怀疑。事实上，要说一八八一年你就来到了这个世上，这听起来也太不靠谱了。”

玛西亚疑惑地看着他。

“我——一八八一年？哦，千真万确！当弗洛罗多拉六重唱组合还在修道院里的时候，我就已经是个二线演员了。索尔·史密斯夫人演朱丽叶的时候，我是第一个扮演她的保姆的演员。呃，欧玛尔，在一八一二年的战争期间，我就已经在餐厅当歌手了。”

贺拉斯灵光一闪，恍然大悟，他咧着嘴笑起来。

“是查理·穆恩让你来的吧？”

玛西亚感到不可思议地看着他。

“查理·穆恩是谁？”

“小个子——大鼻孔——大耳朵。”

她伸着脖子闻了闻。

“我没有观察朋友们的鼻孔的习惯。”

“那么，是查理了？”

玛西亚咬了咬嘴唇，打了个哈欠。

“呃，咱们换个话题吧，欧玛尔。不然的话，我马上就要在椅子上打呼噜了。”

“没错，”贺拉斯一本正经地答道，“休姆总是让人昏昏欲睡。”

“这个人是你的朋友吗？——他要死了吗？”

突然，贺拉斯·塔波克斯无精打采地站了起来，双手插在衣袋里，开始在房间里踱起步子。这是他的另一个习惯性动作。

“我不喜欢这样，”他说道，似乎在自言自语，“一点都不喜欢。我并不是不喜欢你来我这儿——我不介意。你是个非常可爱的人，但是我不喜欢查理·穆恩把你派来。我是个试验品吗？任凭什么人都可以在我身上做实验吗？是我的智商让人觉得好笑吗？我看起来像漫画杂志上的波士顿小屁孩吗？那个乳臭未干的蠢货穆恩，整天没完没了地炫耀他那只有一个礼拜的巴黎见闻，他有什么权利——”

“不是这样的，”玛西亚毅然打断了他的话，“你是个温柔可爱的男孩子。过来，亲亲我。”

贺拉斯立即在她面前停下脚步。

“为什么要我吻你？”他咄咄逼人地问道，“难道你整天都在到处和人接吻吗？”

“哦，没错，”玛西亚平静地承认，“这就是生活的全部意义。整天都在到处和人接吻。”

“那么，”贺拉斯语气坚决地说，“我必须告诉你，你的想法荒唐透顶！首先，接吻并非生活的全部；其次，我不会吻你。接吻可能会变成一种习惯，一种无法戒除的习惯。今年，我的习惯是躺在床上睡懒觉，一直睡到七点半。”

玛西亚善解人意地点点头。

“你过得开心吗？”她问。

“你所说的开心指的是什么？”

“你瞧瞧，”玛西亚严厉地说，“我喜欢你，欧玛尔，不过，希望你说话的时候先想清楚自己要说什么。我感觉你似乎有满肚子的话，可是每次你只要吐出来几个字，就会让你满盘皆输。我问你过得开心吗？”

贺拉斯摇摇头。

“也许，以后会的。”他答道，“你知道，我是个棋子，是个试验品。我不是说我从来没有感到过厌倦——有时候，我的确厌倦过。不过——哎，我说不清楚！可是，你和查理·穆恩所谓的开心，和我认为的却不太一样。”

“请解释一下。”

贺拉斯看着她，开始讲起来，然后又改变了主意，继续踱起方步来。他想努力不去看她，可是没能做到。玛西亚朝他笑了笑。

“请解释一下。”

贺拉斯转过身来。

“如果我说了，你能答应我一个条件吗？转告查理·穆恩，说你来的时候我不在家。”

“嗯嗯。”

“那么，很好。我这就告诉你我的成长经历：我是个盘根问底的孩子。我想知道车轮为什么会转。我父亲是普林斯顿大学年轻的经济学教授。我从小到大，他都尽可能地回答我的每一个问题。我的反应让他产生了一个想法，他想在我身上做一个揠苗助长的实验。他的这种毁灭性的作为使我患上了耳病——尽管在我九岁和十二岁期间已经做了七次手术。当然，这也使我与其他男孩子拉开了距离，使我人为地变得早熟。无论如何，当我的同龄人还在费力地看《拉米斯叔叔》的时候，我已经真心迷恋上了卡图卢斯的原文著作。

“我十三岁的时候就顺利通过了大学入学考试，因为这是顺理成章的事情。教授们纷纷向我伸出援助之手。我知道自己的智商很高，而且在其他方面也没有异常，这让我感到无比自豪。我十六岁时，厌倦了自己的与众不同；我断定，我的情况一定是谁犯了严重的错误所致。然而，既然我已经走到这步田地，最后总要攻读一个文学硕士学位，也算是有个交代。我人生的主要乐趣是钻研现代哲学。我是一个安顿·劳里埃学派的现实主义者——带点伯格森主义的倾向——另外，再过两个月，我就满十八岁了。就是这些。”

“哇！”玛西亚惊叹道，“足够了！你讲起话来真是干脆利落！”

“满意了？”

“不，你还没有亲我。”

“这不在我的计划内，”贺拉斯表示异议，“请理解，我并不是故作清高、不近女色。肉体欢愉自有其存在的合理性，然而——”

“哦，见鬼去吧，别总是那么多大道理！”

“我无能为力。”

“我讨厌像机器一样的人。”

“我向你保证我——”贺拉斯说。

“哦，闭嘴！”

“我个人的理性——”

“关于你的国籍(1)，我可是一个字都没提。你是美国人，没错吧？”

“没错。”

“好，那就好了。我有个想法，我倒是想看您做点与您那高雅的计划无关的事儿。我倒想看看，您说的那个戴着巴西人的配饰(2)的什么人——就是您刚说的，您自己就是那一类人——是否也是个有七情六欲的小人物。”

贺拉斯又摇了摇头。

“我不会吻你的。”

“我的命真苦，”玛西亚哀怨地低声说，“我真是个失败的女人。我这辈子连一个戴着巴西人的配饰的人的亲吻都得不到。”她叹口气，“不管怎样，欧玛尔，你会来看我表演吗？”

“什么表演？”

“我在《霍姆·詹姆斯》里扮演一个角色，非常邪恶！”

“是轻歌剧吗？”

“是的——是个多幕剧。里面有个角色是种水稻的巴西人。也许你会对他感兴趣。”

“我看过《波希米亚女郎》，”贺拉斯大声回答，“我很喜欢这出戏——在某种程度上。”

“那么，你会来啰？”

“呃，我——我——”

“哦，我知道了——你打算去巴西度周末。”

“才不是呢。我很高兴去。”

玛西亚拍拍手。

“你真好！我会给你寄张票——礼拜四晚上行吗？”

“呃，我——”

“好！就礼拜四晚上啦。”

她站起来走到他身边，把双手放在他的肩上。

“我喜欢你，欧玛尔。很抱歉，我原本想戏弄你。我原以为你是个冷血动物，可你是个好孩子。”

他嘲弄地看着她。

“我可比你老几千岁呢。”

“你不老，你的年龄没问题。”

他们庄严地握了握手。

“我叫玛西亚·梅朵，”她加强语气说，“记住——玛西亚·梅朵。我不会告诉查理·穆恩我见到你了。”

过了片刻，她三步并作一步地顺着楼梯朝下跑去，跑到最后一节楼梯处，她听到一个声音从上面的扶手处传来：“哎，嗨——”

她停下脚步，朝上面看了看——只见一个模糊的身影靠在扶手上。

“哎，嗨！”天才又喊了一次，“听见我说话了吗？”

“听得到，你说吧，欧玛尔。”

“希望我没有给你留下认为亲吻在本质上不合情理的印象。”

“印象？哦，你根本就没有亲我啊！别自寻烦恼了——再见。”

听到女人的声音她身旁的两扇门好奇地打开了。楼上传来一阵令人捉摸不透的咳嗽声。玛西亚提着裙子，飞快地从最后一节楼梯上跑了下去，旋即消失在康涅狄格州朦胧的夜色里。

楼上，贺拉斯在书房里来来回回地踱着步子。他时不时地朝深红色的伯克利看上一眼。伯克利静静地守候在那里，温顺而体面，坐垫上放着一本摊开的书。伯克利朝他发出召唤。然后，他发现他在地板上徘徊的脚步正移向离休姆越来越近的地方。休姆已经今非昔比，拥有了某种奇特的、无法言喻的东西。那个轻盈透亮的身影似乎还在附近逗留，假如贺拉斯坐上去，一定会觉得仿佛坐入了女人的怀里。尽管这种感觉让贺拉斯无以名状，然而，它却在他充满疑惑的脑海里萦绕不去，无论如何都显得那么真实。休姆正在向他施加着它在过去整整两百年中都从未有过的某种影响。

休姆正散发着玫瑰的芬芳。





二


礼拜四晚上，贺拉斯·塔波克斯坐在第五排靠近走廊的座位上看《霍姆·詹姆斯》。非常奇怪的是，他觉得自己很快乐。坐在他旁边的那些愤世嫉俗的学生被他惹恼了，因为他对具有哈默斯坦传统的老掉牙的笑话表示赞赏并笑个没完。然而贺拉斯没有理会，他在焦急地等待着玛西亚·梅朵的出场，等她演唱那首爵士乐风格的《愚蠢的胖子》。玛西亚终于出场了，她头戴一顶鲜花点缀的软边帽子，显得活力四射。他的心头腾起一团温暖的火花。一曲唱罢，掌声雷动。然而，他并没有和观众一起鼓掌，他觉得有点神思恍惚。

第二场演完的中场休息期间，一个领座员来到他身边，问他是不是塔波克斯先生，然后递给了他一张纸条，纸条上的字迹珠圆玉润、稚气未脱。领座员不耐烦地在走廊里徘徊时，贺拉斯疑惑地看着纸条。

亲爱的欧玛尔：

演出结束后，我总是饥饿难耐。如果你愿意在塔夫特烧烤店犒赏我一下，就把你的答案告诉那个给你送纸条的大木桩子领座员吧！

你的朋友

玛西亚·梅朵

“告诉她，”他咳了一声“——告诉她，一点问题都没有。我会在剧院前面等她。”

大木桩子领座员傲慢地笑了起来。

“我想她的意识（思）是你到后台入口来。”

“哪里——这个地方在哪里？”

“外面。向卓（左）转，顺着帚（走）廊(3)。”

“什么？”

“外面。向卓（左）转，顺着帚（走）廊。”

这个傲慢自大的家伙走了。贺拉斯身后的一个大一新生在偷偷地乐。

半个小时后，天才和天生就长着一头金色头发的玛西亚面对面地坐在塔夫特烧烤餐厅里，天才正说着奇怪的话。

“最后一幕的那种舞你不得不跳吗？”他急切地问道，“我的意思是，如果你拒绝的话，他们会解雇你吗？”

玛西亚笑了。

“那种舞跳起来很快乐，我喜欢跳。”

然后，贺拉斯说了一句失礼的话。

“我觉得你不会喜欢跳这种舞的，”他直率地说，“坐在我后面的人都在谈论你的乳房呢。”

玛西亚的脸红得像着了火似的。

“我有什么办法，”她急忙说，“对我而言，跳这种舞只是一种杂技表演。上帝呀，这种舞跳起来可不容易啊！每天晚上，我都得花一个小时的时间往肩上擦扭伤膏呢。”

“表演的时候，你觉得——快乐吗？”

“啊——呵呵——当然了！我已经习惯众目睽睽下的感觉了，欧玛尔，我喜欢这种感觉。”

“哎！”贺拉斯一脸不悦地陷入了沉思。

“戴着巴西人的配饰的那个人怎么样了？”

“哎！”贺拉斯又咕哝了一声，停了一下，然后说，“这出戏在这儿演完后还会去哪儿演？”

“纽约。”

“要去多长时间？”

“要看情况。到冬天——也说不定。”

“噢！”

“到时候去看我吧，欧玛尔，难道你没有兴趣吗？这里没有你的房间好，是吗？希望我们现在是在你的房间里。”

“我觉得待在这种地方很傻。”贺拉斯一边坦白地说，一边紧张地看着四周。

“太糟糕了！我们不是相处得很好嘛？”

听到这句话，他突然显得非常忧郁。她改变了语气，伸手拍了拍他的手。

“以前有没有带女演员出去吃过晚饭？”

“没有，”贺拉斯痛苦地说，“而且以后再也不会了。我不知道今晚我为什么会来。这里到处灯火通明，到处都熙熙攘攘，我觉得我根本无法适应。我不知道和你谈些什么。”

“谈谈我吧。上一次我们谈的是你。”

“很好。”

“好吧，梅朵的确是我的姓，但是，玛西亚不是我的真名——我的真名叫维罗尼卡。我十九岁了。问——这个女孩是如何走上演艺道路的？答——她出生于新泽西州的帕塞伊克，一年前她得到了一份可以维持生计的工作，在特伦顿的马塞尔茶室推销纳比斯科饼干。她开始和特伦特音乐餐厅的一个叫罗宾森的歌手交往。一天晚上，他让她试唱了一首歌，并和他试跳了一支舞。整整一个月，我们每天晚上都让餐厅人气爆满。然后，我们就带着厚厚的一沓子推荐信去了纽约。

“两天后，我们就在蒂凡纳里斯饭店找到了工作，而且我还从宫廷剧场的一个小家伙那儿学会了希米舞。我们在蒂凡纳里斯饭店待了六个月，直到一天夜里，专栏作家彼得·博伊斯·文德尔到那儿去吃牛奶吐司。第二天上午，他在报纸上便发表了一首关于不可思议的玛西亚的诗歌。两天之内，我便收到了三个杂耍表演的邀请和一个在《午夜的欢聚》里演出的机会。我给文德尔写了一封感谢信，他把这封信也发表在了他的专栏里——他说这封信的风格和卡莱尔的风格很像，只是文风比较粗犷，并说我应该放弃跳舞而从事北美文学的创作。这又让我得到了几个杂耍表演的邀请和一个在正规表演的节目中出演纯真少女的机会。我接受了——这就是我在这里的原因，欧玛尔。”

她说完了，他们默默地坐了一会儿。她将最后一块威尔士干酪随意地放在叉子上，等着他说话。

“咱们离开这儿吧。”他突然说。

玛西亚的眼神瞬间变得凌厉起来。

“这是什么意思？我让你感到厌烦了吗？”

“不是的，但是我不喜欢这里。我不喜欢和你坐在这里。”

玛西亚不再说话，示意侍者过来。

“结账，”她一个字也不多说，“我的这份——干酪、姜汁啤酒。”

侍者算钱的时候，贺拉斯一脸茫然地看着玛西亚。

“你瞧，”他开始说话了，“我本来打算请你的，你是我的客人。”

玛西亚轻轻地叹口气，从饭桌旁站起来，走了出去。贺拉斯满脸疑惑，把钱放在桌子上，跟着她往外走，上了楼，进入大厅。在电梯前，他追上她，他们面对面站着。

“你瞧，”他重复着刚才的话，“你是我的客人。我的话冒犯你了吗？”

片刻的惊诧过后，玛西亚的眼神柔和下来。

“你是个粗鲁无理的家伙，”她缓缓地说，“难道你不知道你很粗鲁吗？”

“我也没办法。”贺拉斯说道，坦率的话语消除了她的敌意，“你知道我喜欢你。”

“你曾经说过你不喜欢和我在一起。”

“我以前是不喜欢和你在一起。”

“为什么？”

他的眼睛里仿佛有一片灰色的森林突然燃起了熊熊大火。

“因为以前不喜欢。不过，现在我已经喜欢上你。这两天我的脑子里装的全是你。”

“那么，如果你——”

“等一下，”他打断她的话，“我有话要说。是这样的：再过六个礼拜，我就满十八岁了。等我满十八岁的时候，我就去纽约看你。纽约有我们能去的地方吗？有租客不多的房子吗？”

“当然有！”玛西亚笑了，“你可以到我的公寓来。如果你不嫌弃，就睡到沙发上。”

“我不想睡沙发，”他斩钉截铁地说，“我只想和你说话。”

“哦，当然，”玛西亚又说了一遍刚才的话，“我的公寓就行。”

贺拉斯激动地把双手插进衣袋里。

“好——一言为定，我要和你单独在一起。我要和你像在我的房间里一样说话。”

“亲爱的伙计，”玛西亚笑着大声说，“那是不是意味着你想吻我？”

“是的，”贺拉斯几乎是大声叫喊着说，“如果你同意，我就吻你。”

负责开电梯的那个人用责备的眼神看着他们。玛西亚朝电梯口的栅栏门走去。

“我会给你寄明信片的。”她说。

贺拉斯的眼神已经疯狂。

“一定给我寄啊！过了一月一日，我会随时来找你。那时我就满十八岁了。”

她步入电梯时，他对着电梯的天花板莫名其妙地咳了一声，隐隐约约地带点挑战的意味，像是回应一种呼喊。接着，他快步离开了。





三


他又来了。她向躁动不安的曼哈顿观众席上投去第一瞥时，就看见他了——他坐在第一排，头稍稍向前倾，两只灰色的眼睛紧紧地盯着她。她知道，对他来说，这个偌大的剧场里就只有他们两人在一起，那排浓妆艳抹的芭蕾舞演员们的脸庞和那轰鸣呜咽的小提琴伴奏他都视而不见、充耳不闻。对他而言，那些统统可以忽略不计，如同维纳斯石像上飘落的微尘。她的心头被激起一种本能的抵触情绪。

“傻小子！”她匆匆地自言自语了一句，没有接受观众们的加演要求。

“一个礼拜才能挣到一百块，他们还希求什么呢——永不减退的激情吗？”她在后台兀自抱怨。

“玛西亚，怎么了？”

“我不喜欢坐在前排的那个家伙。”

在最后一幕，她正要表演最擅长的绝技时，忽然奇怪地感到怯场。她没有给贺拉斯寄承诺过的明信片。昨天夜里，她装作没看见他——跳完舞，她就急匆匆地离开剧院，在公寓里度过了一个不眠之夜——这个月她经常会这样——想着他那苍白而热切的面容，单薄而稚嫩的身体，无情又不谙世事的恍惚神思，这些都令她着迷。

现在他来了，她又隐隐约约地感到心情低落——仿佛被迫背上了异乎寻常的责任。

“神童！”她大声说。

“你在说什么？”站在她身边的一个黑人滑稽演员问道。

“没什么——自己说着玩儿的。”

在舞台上，她感觉好多了。这是她擅长的舞蹈——她总觉得她这样的跳法对男人的挑逗最多也不过和漂亮女孩给予男人的想象一样。她跳舞只是一种特技表演而已。

住宅区，商业区，果冻装在汤勺里，

太阳沉下去，在月光下颤抖不已。

现在，他没有看她。她看得清清楚楚。他在故意看背景上的城堡，脸上带着在塔夫特烧烤餐厅时的那副神情。她的心头燃起一团怒火——他在责怪她。

是那摇曳的身姿令我颤抖不已，

奇怪的是我的心中如何充满了这样的情感，

住宅区，商业区——

她的心头被无法抑制的反感情绪所占据，她突然可怕地意识到了观众的存在，这是她第一次登台以来从来没有过的事情。第一排那张苍白的脸是在向她暗送秋波吗？那个年轻女孩的嘴角是不是吊着一缕厌恶之情？她的那两个肩膀——那两个颤抖的肩膀——是她的肩膀吗？这真的是她的肩膀吗？她的肩膀肯定不会颤抖的！

然后——你看一眼就会明了一切。

葬礼上我需要圣维特斯跳着舞引领

在世界的尽头我会——

一支巴松管和两架大提琴喧嚣着进入尾声。她停下来，拉紧每一条肌肉，踮着脚尖摆出一个造型，她青春的面容带着后来被一个年轻女观众称为“如此奇怪的、疑惑的表情”，目光呆滞地注视着观众，没有鞠躬就匆匆离开舞台。她跑进更衣室，迅速脱下一条裙子，又钻进另一条裙子里，到外面叫了一辆出租车。

她的公寓很暖和——空间很小，里面有一排剧照和几套吉卜林和欧·亨利的书，这是她有一次从一个蓝眼睛的代理商那里买来的，偶尔看一看。有几把和公寓相匹配的椅子，但是没有一把舒服的；有一盏绘有黑鹂图案的灯，罩着粉红色的灯罩，把整个房间变成了一个令人窒息的粉红色世界。房间里也有几件令人愉悦的东西——令人愉悦的东西却无情地互相敌对，在神思恍惚的时刻越发有一种错位的感觉，一种无法忍受的滋味。而最糟糕的莫过于一幅用橡树皮镶嵌的、从伊利铁路看过去的帕塞伊克市的大型风景画——总之，这是一次为了打造一间令人振奋的屋子而进行的极度夸张的、极度吝啬的疯狂尝试。玛西亚知道这是一个败笔。

天才走进屋子，笨拙地握住了她的双手。

“这次我追上你了。”他说。

“哦！”

“我要你嫁给我。”他说。

她张开双臂投入他的怀抱，充满激情地亲吻了他的嘴唇。

“嘿！”

“我爱你。”他说。

她再次吻了他，然后轻叹一声，猛地坐到扶手椅上，半躺在那里，莫名其妙地笑起来，直笑得浑身发抖。

“哦，你这个神童！”她叫道。

“很好，如果你想这么叫就这么叫好了。我对你说过我比你老一万岁——现在依然比你老一万岁。”

她又大笑起来。

“我不喜欢别人和我对着干。”

“再也没有人和你对着干了。”

“欧玛尔，”她问道，“你为什么要和我结婚？”

天才站起身，把两只手插到衣袋里。

“因为我爱你，玛西亚·梅朵。”

然后，她不再叫他欧玛尔。

“亲爱的伙计，”她说，“你知道我还是有点爱你的。你身上有种东西——我说不出是什么——每次见到你，它都让我备受煎熬。但是，亲爱的——”她不说了。

“但是什么？”

“但是存在很多问题呀。但是你只有十八岁，而我快二十岁了。”

“胡说！”他打断她的话，“这么说吧——我已经十九岁了，你也十九岁，我们的年龄很接近——之前说的比你大一万岁就不算了。”

玛西亚大笑起来。

“但是还有一些‘但是’。你的家人——”

“我的家人！”天才恶狠狠地大声叫道，“我的家人只想把我变成一个魔鬼。”他的脸憋得通红，放出了狠话：“我的家人可以回家坐下来歇着了！”

“天哪！”玛西亚担心地叫起来，“至于吗？我认为是方法问题。”

“方法——对极了，”他强烈赞同，“所有的事情都是这样。我越来越觉得他们宁愿让我变成一具干尸——”

“是谁让你意识到了你的那种情况？”玛西亚轻声问，“是我吗？”

“是的。自从遇见了你，我就开始嫉妒在大街上见到的每一个人，因为他们都比我早知道爱情是什么。我曾经把爱情称作‘性冲动’。天哪！”

“还有‘但是’呢。”玛西亚说道。

“是什么？”

“我们怎么生活？”

“我会去挣钱。”

“你还在上大学。”

“你认为我就那么想得到文学硕士吗？”

“嘿，你想得到我(4)，是吗？”

“是的！什么？我的意思是，不是的！”

玛西亚大笑起来，轻盈地落到了他的腿上。他疯狂地抱紧她，在她的脖子上印上了一个深深的吻痕。

“你很单纯，”玛西亚开心地说，“不过，你似乎不怎么理智。”

“哦，别总提那该死的理智！”

“没办法。”玛西亚说道。

“我恨这些机器一样的人！”

“但是我们——”

“哦，别说了！”

玛西亚总不能用耳朵说话，（她的嘴巴被吻住了）所以她只好不说了。





四


二月初，贺拉斯和玛西亚结婚了。这在耶鲁和普林斯顿学术圈里引起了巨大的轰动。十四岁就在一家都市报的周日杂志专栏发表文章的贺拉斯·塔波克斯，现在放弃了自己的事业，放弃了成为美国哲学领域世界权威的机会，娶了一位合唱团的姑娘——他们认为玛西亚是合唱团的。但是和现代所有的奇谈怪事一样，这桩奇闻也只热闹了四天半便归于平静了。

他们在哈莱姆(5)租了一套公寓。经过两个礼拜的求职，贺拉斯的学术知识价值观无情地崩塌了。他在一家南美出口公司谋得了一个小职员的职位——他听人讲过出口业很有前途。玛西亚打算继续在剧团里多待几个月——无论如何她都要坚持到他站稳脚跟再说。尽管有人告诉他，几个月后，他就可以挣到双倍工资，但开始时他的月薪只有一百二十美元，因此玛西亚甚至拒绝考虑放弃她当时每个礼拜能挣到一百五十美元的工作。

“亲爱的，我们把我们自己称作‘头和肩膀’吧，”她温柔地说，“肩膀可以继续抖动得久一点，一直到这颗古老的脑袋也开始抖动起来为止。”

“我不喜欢这个样子。”他闷闷不乐地反驳道。

“嗯，”她加重语气说，“你的工资还不够我们付房租呢。别以为我想出风头——我才不想呢。我只想做你的妻子。但是，要是你让我闲坐在屋子里，一边等你，一边数墙纸上的太阳花，我会变成弱智的。等你每个月能挣到三百美元的时候，我就辞职。”

尽管这话很伤自尊，贺拉斯也不得不承认，她的想法更加切合实际。

从三月到四月，日子过得和和美美。到了五月，曼哈顿的公园里、小河边，到处洋溢着的欢声笑语也见证了他们的幸福。贺拉斯没有什么爱好——他没有培养爱好的时间——然而事实证明他是个十分称职的丈夫。而且因为玛西亚对于令贺拉斯十分着迷的事情完全没有意见，因此，他们几乎没有什么磕磕碰碰的矛盾。他们有各自的分工。玛西亚实际上扮演了务实的管家的角色，而贺拉斯要么依然生活在他过去那抽象思维的世界里，要么就心满意足地生活在对妻子全心全意的崇拜中。她让他惊喜不断——她的想法鲜活而新颖，她活力四射、头脑清醒，她有永不枯竭的幽默感。

无论玛西亚在哪里展示她的表演才华，她对丈夫的聪明才智所流露出的无与伦比的自豪都会令她的九点档节目的同事们印象深刻。他们只知道贺拉斯是一个文弱而不苟言笑、看上去稚气未脱的年轻人，他每天晚上都等着接她回家。

“贺拉斯，”一天晚上，玛西亚像往常一样在十一点钟见到他时说道，“你站在街灯下时，看上去像个鬼魂。你瘦了是不是？”

他不知其可地摇摇头。

“我不知道。今天他们把我的工资涨到了一百三十五美元，还有——”

“我不在乎，”玛西亚严肃地说，“你要是再熬夜工作的话，非把自己累死不可。你看那些经济的大部头书本——”

“经济学。”贺拉斯纠正道。

“哦，每天晚上，我都睡了很久了，你还在看这些书。你又回到我们结婚前那种弯腰弓背的状态了。”

“可是，玛西亚，我必须——”

“不，你用不着那样，亲爱的。我想，现在我是老板，我可不想让我的伙计把身体累垮，把眼睛累坏。你得锻炼锻炼身体了。”

“我锻炼了。每天早上我——”

“哦，我知道！但是你的那些哑铃根本消耗不了多少热量。我的意思是真正的锻炼。你得去健身房。还记得你对我说过的，你曾经是个体操健将，有人想把你选进大学体操队去，可他们没能如愿，因为当时你正和赫伯特·斯宾塞见面？”

“以前我喜欢锻炼，”贺拉斯思虑重重地说，“可是现在锻炼太浪费时间了。”

“好吧，”玛西亚说，“我和你做个交易。你去健身房健身，我就从你那排发黄的书里面挑一本来读。”

“《佩皮斯日记》吗？哦，那本书应该很有意思，读起来很轻松。”

“对我来说，可不是这样——一点都不轻松，就像啃厚玻璃板一样。不过，你一直对我说，这本书能让我眼界大开。好吧，你每个礼拜去三次健身房，我就服一剂大剂量的塞米(6)。”

贺拉斯犹豫不决。

“呃——”

“好了，就这么定了！你为我做几个大回环，我为你学点文化知识。”

就这样，贺拉斯终于同意了，整个烈日炎炎的夏天，他每个礼拜都花三或四个晚上到斯基珀健身房去练习吊环。八月份，他向玛西亚承认，锻炼使他白天的脑力劳动更有效率。

“健全的灵魂寓于健全的体魄。”他说道。

“别信那些玩意儿，”玛西亚答道，“我吃过那些特效药，全都是垃圾。(7)你只管坚持去健身房就好了。”

九月初的一个晚上，在一间几乎空无一人的健身房里，他正在完成一个高难度的吊环扭体动作，一个若有所思的胖男人和他搭起话来，他注意到这个人已经观察他几个晚上了。

“嗨，小伙子，再展示一下你昨天晚上的那个绝活儿。”

贺拉斯在吊环上咧开嘴冲他笑了笑。

“我自创的，”他说，“受到了欧几里得第四定理的启发。”

“他是哪个马戏团的？”

“他已经死了。”

“哦，他一定是在做那个绝活儿时折断了脖子。昨天晚上我坐在这里想，你肯定也会把你的脖子弄断的。”

“像这样！”贺拉斯说着，把吊环荡起来，演示了他的绝活儿。

“这不会扭伤脖子和肩膀上的筋肉吗？”

“刚开始的时候会，但是一个礼拜后，就不会了。”

“呵！”

贺拉斯悠闲地抓着吊环荡来荡去。

“有没有想过把这个作为你的职业？”胖男人问道。

“没想过。”

“要是愿意干这个绝活儿，能挣大钱，没准还能出名哩。”

“还有个绝招呢。”贺拉斯热切而欢快地说。胖男人看到这个身穿粉色针织运动衫的普罗米修斯再次公然挑衅上帝和牛顿的时候，顿时惊得目瞪口呆。

这次见面的第二天，贺拉斯下班回到家，发现玛西亚脸色苍白，正躺在沙发上等他。

“今天我晕倒了两次。”她直接说。

“什么？”

“是的。你瞧，再过四个月宝宝就出生了。医生说我两个礼拜前就不该再跳舞了。”

贺拉斯坐下来认真思考。

“我很高兴，当然，”他心事重重地说，“我的意思是我很高兴我们要有孩子了。但是这意味着我们今后得花很多钱。”

“我有两百五十美元的存款，”玛西亚满怀希望地说，“而且还有两个礼拜的薪水没有领呢。”

贺拉斯飞快地计算着。

“加上我的工资，接下来的半年时间里，我们差不多总共会有一千四百美元。”

玛西亚看起来忧心忡忡。

“总共就这么多吗？当然了，这个月我可以找个地方唱歌。三月份的时候，我就又可以去上班了。”

“当然不要你操心了！”贺拉斯粗鲁地说，“你就乖乖待在家里。现在我们来看看——除了保姆费，还要支付医生和护士的费用。我们还得再准备点钱。”

“哦，”玛西亚疲惫不堪地说，“我可不知道从哪儿弄啦。现在得靠这颗古老的脑袋，不关肩膀的事了。”

贺拉斯站起来，穿上了外套。

“你要去哪里？”

“我有办法了，”他答道，“我很快就回来。”

十分钟后，他已经走在通往斯基珀健身房的路上。他感到心平气和，又觉得十分奇妙，这种感受很纯粹，不掺杂任何滑稽的成分。要是在一年前，他会对自己的这个决定感到多么惊讶！大家又会感到多么惊讶啊！然而，当生活叩响了你的大门，你敞开大门迎接的不仅是生活本身，还会有许多东西纷至沓来。

健身房里灯光明亮，他等眼睛适应过来后，发现那个若有所思的胖男人正坐在一堆帆布垫子上抽着一根大雪茄。

“嗨，”贺拉斯开门见山地说，“昨天晚上你说我的吊环绝技可以赚钱，这话是真的吗？”

“哦，那还用说？”胖男人吃惊地说。

“嗯，我一直都在考虑这件事，我想我愿意试试。我可以晚上和礼拜六下午来表演——而且如果报酬足够高的话，我可以每天都来。”

胖男人看了看手表。

“哦，”他说，“查理·鲍尔森才是你要见的人。他要是看到你的表演，不出四天就会用你。他现在不在，不过明天晚上我会替你盯住他。”

胖男人很守信用。第二天晚上，查理·鲍尔森来了，他花了一个小时的时间，无比惊诧地观看了这位天才在空中上下翻飞、左右腾跃，画出无数条令人惊叹的抛物线。再过了一晚，他带来了两个人，他们人高马大，看上去似乎一生下来就会抽黑雪茄，一直在小声而兴致勃勃地谈论跟钱有关的事情。然后，在接下来的那个礼拜六，贺拉斯·塔波克斯在科尔曼街花园进行了首次职业亮相表演。尽管观众几乎有五千人之多，贺拉斯却一点都不觉得紧张。他从很小就开始当众朗读他的论文，深谙把自己与观众隔离的技巧。

“玛西亚，”当天晚上表演结束后，他欣喜地说，“我想我们有解决问题的办法了。鲍尔森觉得他能在竞技场剧院为我弄到一个空缺，能干上一整个冬天。竞技场剧院，你知道，是个大——”

“是的，我相信我听说过这家剧院，”玛西亚打断了他的话，“但是，我想知道你表演的这个绝活儿，不会是那种场面壮烈的自杀型表演吧？”

“小事一桩，”贺拉斯平静地说，“不过，如果你能告诉我，男人以哪种方式自杀会比为你冒险更好的话，那么没关系，我宁愿那样去死。”

玛西亚张开双臂紧紧搂住他的脖子。

“亲我，”她轻轻地说，“叫我‘心肝宝贝’。我喜欢听你叫我‘心肝宝贝’。给我一本书让我明天看。我不要再看塞姆·佩皮斯了，我想看点浅显有意思的东西。我整天无聊死了，实在想做点什么。我想写信，可是我不知道给谁写。”

“给我写，”贺拉斯说，“我会看的。”

“希望我可以，”玛西亚吸了口气，“如果我认的字够多，我会给你写一封世界上最长的情书，而且永远不会为此感到厌倦。”

然而，又过了两个月，玛西亚变得越来越疲惫。一连几个晚上，年轻的贺拉斯都是一脸焦灼、精疲力竭地站在竞技场剧院的观众面前。因此，一个年轻人替他暂时表演了两个晚上。这个人穿着浅蓝色而非白色的运动装，几乎没有人给他鼓掌。不过两天后，贺拉斯重新出场了，那些坐得离舞台较近的观众从这个年轻的杂技演员的脸上看到了一种快乐而安详的幸福表情，甚至当他在空中上气不接下气地做着各种翻转，表演他那令人赞叹的、自创的肩部动作时，也都是如此。在那次表演之后，他冲负责开电梯的人笑了笑，然后五步并作一步地冲到楼上的公寓里——踮着脚尖小心翼翼地进入安静的房间。

“玛西亚。”他轻轻地叫道。

“嗨！”她虚弱地朝他笑笑，“贺拉斯，我想让你做点事情。到书橱最上面的抽屉里找找看，有一大叠纸。那是一本书——就算是书吧——贺拉斯，那是我这三个月待在家里闲得无聊的时候写的。我希望你能把它送到那个曾把我的信刊登上报的彼得·博伊斯·文德尔那儿。他会告诉你这是不是一本好书。我写书的风格和我讲话一个样，就是和我写给他的那封信的风格一个样。只是一个故事，是我亲身经历过的很多事情。你会把它送给他吗，贺拉斯？”

“我会的，亲爱的。”

他朝床头弯下身子，把头放在枕头上，挨着她，开始轻抚她金色的头发。

“最最亲爱的玛西亚。”他温柔地说。

“不，”她喃喃地说，“请按照我喜欢的方式叫我。”

“心肝宝贝，”他充满激情地轻声耳语道，“最最、最最亲爱的心肝宝贝。”

“我们给她起个名字吧？”

贺拉斯在为孩子想名字的时候，他们便能在这种幸福、安静的满足感中休息一会儿。

“我们叫她玛西亚·休姆·塔波克斯吧。”他终于说。

“为什么叫休姆？”

“因为这家伙是我们的第一个见证人呀。”

“这样啊？”她喃喃着，恹恹欲睡，又有点吃惊，“我还以为那个人叫穆恩呢。”

她闭上眼睛，过了一会儿，她胸脯上的被单开始平缓地一起一伏，她睡着了。

贺拉斯踮着脚尖走到书橱边，打开上面的抽屉，发现一摞字迹潦草，几乎是涂鸦般的书稿。他看了看第一页：

桑德拉·佩皮斯，简写本

玛西亚·塔波克斯

他笑了。这么说来，塞缪尔·佩皮斯还是对她产生了影响。他翻了一页，开始看起来。他笑得更开心了——往下看了下去。半个小时过去了，他意识到玛西亚已经醒了，正从床上看着他。

“亲爱的。”耳畔传来了轻声的呼唤。

“什么事，玛西亚？”

“你喜欢吗？”

贺拉斯咳了一声。

“我还在看呢。很有趣。”

“把它送给彼得·博伊斯·文德尔。告诉他你在普林斯顿大学取得过最优秀的成绩，所以你知道一本书是不是好书。告诉他这本书会轰动全世界。”

“好的，玛西亚。”贺拉斯温柔地说。

她的眼睛又闭上了，贺拉斯走过去吻了吻她的额头——他在她身边站了一会儿，脸上写满了温柔的怜惜。然后他离开了房间。

那一整晚，一页页涂鸦似的手稿、一连串的拼写错误和语法错误、一堆奇怪的标点符号，它们在他眼前跳动着。夜里他醒了几次，每次都对玛西亚在字里行间所流露出的灵魂的渴望充满了无法言喻的、难以抑制的同情。他对玛西亚写书这件事产生了极其怜惜的感觉，几个月以来，他第一次开始认真思考起几乎被自己遗忘了的梦想。

他曾经打算撰写一部论文集来普及新现实主义，正如叔本华普及了悲观主义，威廉·詹姆斯普及了实用主义一样。

然而，生活并不由人随心所欲。生活操纵了他，迫使他去表演吊环。回想起书房外的敲门声，休姆椅子上那个轻盈透亮的身影，玛西亚的索吻，他大笑起来。

“我还是我，”他躺在黑暗中毫无睡意，惊奇地大声说，“我还是那个坐在伯克利椅子上的莽夫，以为如果不想听，敲门声就不存在。我依然是那个人。我可能会因为自己犯下的罪过而被处以电刑。

“可怜的、轻薄的灵魂试图以可感可触的方式讲述自己的人生。玛西亚和她写的书，我和我未写出的书。我们试图选择某些手段，得到我们想要的东西，并因此而感到幸福。”

《桑德拉·佩皮斯，简写本》由专栏作家彼得·博伊斯·文德尔作序，在《乔丹杂志》上连载，并在三月份以单行本的形式出版发行。自连载的第一期开始，这本书就引起了广泛的关注。一个老生常谈的话题——一个女孩出生于新泽西州的一个小镇，她来到纽约，走上了舞台——情节简单，语言离奇生动，在极其有限的字里行间滚动着挥之不去的忧伤，产生了无法抗拒的艺术魅力。

当时，彼得·博伊斯·文德尔正好在提倡通过直接吸收富有表现力的方言来丰富美国的语言表达体系，作为发起人，他慷慨陈词，怒斥传统评论者毫无生气的陈词滥调。

玛西亚每期连载都可以得到的三百美元稿酬，这笔钱来得正是时候，因为尽管贺拉斯在竞技场剧院的月薪比玛西亚过去多得多，但小玛西亚发出一阵阵尖锐的哭叫，他们就把这种现象解释为需要去呼吸一下乡间新鲜的空气了。因此，四月初，他们便住进了韦斯特切斯特县的平房里，这里有草坪、汽车库，应有尽有，还有一间坚固的、隔音效果非常好的书房。玛西亚信誓旦旦地向乔丹先生承诺，等她女儿的需求开始减少的时候，就会把自己关进书房里，以创作她那名垂千古的文盲文学。

“一点都不坏。”一天夜里，当贺拉斯从车站回家的时候这样想。他正在憧憬几个向他敞开大门的光明前景：一个为期四个月的杂耍表演机会，工资是五位数字；一个回到普林斯顿大学负责所有健身房事务的机会。奇怪！他曾经打算回到那儿去负责所有哲学事务，而现在，听到他曾经的偶像安顿·劳里埃造访纽约的消息，他竟然几乎不为所动。

砾石在脚下沙沙作响。他看见他家客厅里灯火通明，还看到一辆大汽车停在那里，发动机还在转动。可能又是乔丹先生来劝说玛西亚，要她定下心来搞创作的吧。

她已经听到他回来的脚步声，跑出来迎接他，她的身形在明亮的门口变成了一个剪影。

“有个法国人来了，”她紧张地悄声说，“我不会念他的名字，但是他的话听起来非常深奥。你得和他谈谈。”

“什么法国人？”

“我也不知道。他和乔丹先生一个小时前就到了，他说他想见见桑德拉·佩皮斯，以及诸如此类的事情。”

他们走进屋子的时候，这两个人都从椅子上站了起来。

“你好，塔波克斯，”乔丹说，“我终于把你们这两位大名人聚在一起了。这位是劳里埃先生。劳里埃先生，这位是塔波克斯先生，塔波克斯太太的丈夫。”

“不会是安顿·劳里埃吧！”贺拉斯吃惊地说。

“没错呀，是我啊，我必须来，一定得来。我看了您夫人的书，它让我着迷。”他在衣袋里摸索着，“啊，我也看到您了。这张报纸，我今天看的，上面有您的名字。”

他终于掏出了一张从杂志上剪下来的纸条。

“看看！”他热切地说，“也提到您了。”

贺拉斯扫了一眼这张纸条。

“对美国方言文学的非凡贡献，”纸条上说，“没有故弄玄虚的文学腔调；该书的价值恰恰体现在这里，可以和《哈克贝利·费恩历险记》相媲美。”

贺拉斯看到了下面的一段文字；一下子惊得目瞪口呆——赶忙往下看：

“玛西亚·塔波克斯不仅是一名观众，而且还是一位演员的妻子，这使她与舞台产生了紧密的联系。去年，她嫁给了贺拉斯·塔波克斯。每天晚上，她的丈夫都以精湛的飞人表演在竞技场剧院给孩子们带来欢乐。据说，这对年轻夫妻自称‘头和肩膀’。毫无疑问，它指的是这样一个事实：塔波克斯太太负责写书和思考，而她的丈夫利用其柔软灵活的肩膀为家庭开支贡献一分力量。

“塔波克斯太太被冠以‘天才’之名简直是实至名归——虽然这个头衔已经被人用滥。她只有二十岁——”

贺拉斯看不下去了，他用非常奇怪的眼神目不转睛地盯着安顿·劳里埃。

“我想给您提个建议——”他变得粗鲁无理。

“哦？”

“有人敲门的话，别去开门！随便他们怎么敲——最好装个隔音门。”

(1) 理性（rationality）和国籍（nationality）两个英语单词的拼写十分相近，只差一个字母，发音相近。玛西亚文化程度不高，所以误把两个单词混为一谈了。于是就有了下面这段奇怪的谈话。——译者注

(2) 玛西亚在这里说的巴西人的配饰（Brazilian trimmings），是对上文贺拉斯说的伯格森主义倾向（Bergsonian trimmings）的误解。因为“Brazilian”和“Bergsonian”发音相似，玛西亚文化程度不高，不知道伯格森，所以就将其误解成“巴西人”了。而“trimmings”这个词，在上文中有倾向和色彩的意义，下文中则正好可以按照该词的本义“装饰品”来理解，所以，玛西亚对贺拉斯的误解也就顺理成章了。——译者注

(3) 这个领座员吐字不清，让人摸不着头脑。

(4) Master兼有“硕士”和“主人”两个意思，玛西亚直接把贺拉斯在上文中所说的Master of Arts篡改为Master of Me，令贺拉斯猝不及防，左右为难。因为他很难对玛西亚的话做出恰当的回应，不管他怎么回答，似乎都不妥。他如果回答“是”，就意味着他想成为玛西亚的主人；如果他回答“不是”，又意味着他不想娶玛西亚为妻。玛西亚的聪慧、机灵、可爱由此可见一斑。翻译时，译者在语言上稍微做了处理，力图体现作者在这里利用双关语而使谈话显得俏皮的语言风格。——译者注

(5) 纽约的黑人住宅区。

(6) Sammy指的是Samuel Pepys（塞缪尔·佩皮斯）。对玛西亚来说，读书就像喝药，很艰难，因此，她用了take one big dose（服一剂大剂量的药）的说法。意思就是多看点塞缪尔·佩皮斯的书。

(7) 贺拉斯说了一句拉丁语即“Mens sana in corpore sano”（意思是健全的灵魂寓于健全的体魄），玛西亚认为贺拉斯说的是一种特效药，因此说了下面的话。小说中有好几个地方都出现了类似的情况，玛西亚总是误解贺拉斯的话，因为他们两人在文化程度上有较大的差距。





伯妮斯剪短发


一


礼拜六晚上，天黑之后，站在高尔夫球场第一个发球区，可以望见乡村俱乐部的窗子透出黄色的灯光，照着一大片黑压压的、人头攒动的人群。这么说吧，这人群实际上是由许多好奇的球童、一些智商高点的司机和那个职业高尔夫球手的聋子妹妹组成的——而且，通常，还有一些因为缺乏自信而游离在外的人流，如果他们想，便会随时涌入俱乐部。这就是周末舞会的盛况。

俱乐部大厅和舞厅的墙连在一起，围成一个内置式的露台，沿墙摆放着一圈藤椅。礼拜六晚上来跳舞的大多是女人，一大群吵吵嚷嚷的中年妇女，戴着长柄眼镜，乳房高耸，目光犀利，心如铁石。这个露台的主要功能就是供这些女人挑毛病的。她们偶尔也会勉强说几句恭维之词，但永远都是违心之语。因为，超过三十五岁的女人都非常明白，参加夏季舞会的年轻人都怀有世界上最龌龊的不轨意图。如果没有这些女人杀伤力十足的目光，那些情侣会溜到角落里去跳一种奇怪而粗鄙的舞蹈。而更流行、更危险的做法是，跳舞的年轻人常常会躲进停车场，在毫不知情的贵妇人们的豪华轿车里接吻。

然而，这群吹毛求疵的女人毕竟离舞台不够近，因此，她们看不清男演员们的脸庞，也捕捉不到那些微妙的插曲。她们只能蹙着眉头，猫着身子去打探消息，根据自以为是的推测——比如，凡是收入可观的年轻人都过着招蜂引蝶的浪荡日子——做出心满意足的论断。她们从来都无法真正理解青春世界变化无常的剧情，也无法真正体会到青春世界残酷无情的一面。没有包厢，各色人等、各种声音混杂在一起，随着戴尔舞蹈乐队忧郁的非洲旋律摇摆，这就是舞会的乐队、主角和合唱团。

在这些人中，十六岁的奥迪斯·奥蒙德还有两年就要从希尔学院毕业了；G.李斯·斯托达德在他家的书桌上悬挂着哈佛大学的法学学位证书；小马德琳·霍格顶着一头奇怪的头发，看起来很别扭；贝茜·麦克雷过上派对生活的时间可是有点长了——十多年了——他们这群人不仅是舞会的主角，还是能够毫无遮挡地看到表演的观众。

随着一阵花式演奏和一声巨响，音乐戛然而止。舞者们轻松地交换着习以为常的微笑，嘻嘻哈哈地重复着“啦——得——嗒——嗒，嗒姆——嗒姆”，接着，姑娘们叽叽喳喳的欢声笑语骤然盖过了人们的掌声。

几个没有女伴的年轻人正要插进去和女孩们跳舞，音乐的突然停止令舞池中的他们有些失望，有些无所适从，因而他们只好收起热情，无精打采地退回到墙边。和圣诞舞会的狂欢气氛不同，夏季舞会的节奏令人愉快，人们的兴奋程度也恰到好处。因此，已婚的年轻人也会站起来，跳起古老的华尔兹和难看得要命的狐步舞，和对他们报以迁就态度的弟弟妹妹们一起玩乐。

沃伦·麦金泰尔，一个随便对待学业的耶鲁大学学生，就是这样一个没有舞伴的落寞之人。他从无尾晚礼服的口袋里摸出一根雪茄，溜达到外面的露台上。露台宽敞，灯影朦胧，舞者们散坐在桌子旁。灯影绰绰的夜空，荡漾着暧昧的情话和迷离的笑声。他向周围那些漫不经心的人点头致意。从每一对舞者身边经过时，他的脑海里都会浮起某个处于半沉睡状态的故事片段。这个城市并不大，每个人都对其他人的底细了如指掌。比如，吉姆·斯特兰和埃塞尔·德莫雷斯特已经恋爱三年了。谁都知道，吉姆要是能找到一份工作并能坚持干上两个多月，埃塞尔就会嫁给他。然而，他俩看上去多么不开心呀。有时，埃塞尔厌倦地望着吉姆，仿佛想弄明白，自己过去怎么会把感情的藤蔓缠绕在这样一棵在风雨中飘摇的树上。

十九岁的沃伦很为那些没有去东部上大学的朋友们惋惜。但是，和大多数男孩子一样，一旦远离家乡，他就会极力夸耀远在家乡的姑娘们。吉纳维芙·奥蒙德总是到普林斯顿、耶鲁、威廉姆斯和康奈尔大学去跳舞、参加家庭派对、踢足球。在同龄人当中，黑眼睛的罗伯塔·迪琳和同辈的约翰逊·海勒姆与泰·考柏一样有名气。当然，还有玛娇丽·哈维，她貌若天仙，嘴巴抹蜜。除此之外，她还因为去年在纽黑文举行的软皮鞋舞和木屐舞的舞会上连续做了五个侧手翻而大名鼎鼎。

沃伦和玛娇丽隔街而居，他对她早已情根深种。有时，她用一点少得可怜的感激之情来回报他。而且，她还用一个百试不爽的方法来考验他：郑重其事地告诉他，她不爱他。她的具体做法是：一旦他不在身边，她就把他抛到脑后，而去和其他小伙子们谈情说爱。沃伦很沮丧，特别是，整个夏天玛娇丽三天两头去旅行，每次在她回来后的头几天，他都会发现她家客厅的桌子上堆满了写给她的情书，信封上的字迹遒劲有力，为不同的男性所写。更糟的是，八月份她的表妹伯妮斯从奥克莱尔来看她，整整一个月她们俩都黏在一起。他想和她单独见一面似乎是不可能的事。总得想办法另外找人把伯妮斯支开。八月份快结束的时候，想和她单独待一会儿更是难上加难。

尽管沃伦非常爱慕玛娇丽，但他不得不承认，她的表妹伯妮斯也一点都不差。她很漂亮，头发乌黑，面颊红润。不过，她在舞会上没有一点情趣。每个礼拜六晚上，为了取悦玛娇丽，他都得没完没了、热情洋溢地和她的表妹跳舞，以完成差事。然而，和伯妮斯在一起，他简直无聊透顶。

“沃伦。”一声温柔的呼唤从肘边传来，打断了他的思绪。他望着玛娇丽，一脸兴奋，心旌荡漾。她将一只手搭在他的肩膀上，他的心头悄然腾起一团火花。

“沃伦，”她轻声慢语地说，“帮我个忙——和伯妮斯跳支舞吧。她被小奥迪斯·奥蒙德缠住了，都快一个小时了。”

沃伦心中的火花熄灭了。

“哦，好啊。”他心不在焉地答道。

“你不会介意的，是吗？我不会让你脱不开身的。”

“没事的。”

玛娇丽笑了——这一笑足以表达她的感激之情。

“你简直是个天使，我不胜感激。”

天使叹口气，到露台上四处寻找，却不见伯妮斯和奥迪斯的踪影。他又转回来，在女更衣室前看见了奥迪斯。奥迪斯站在一群男孩子中间，挥舞着一根不知从哪儿捡来的木棍儿，正在高谈阔论，小伙子们笑得像抽了风一样。

“她在里面弄头发呢，”他扯着嗓子说，“我正等着和她再跳上一个小时。”

又爆发出一轮笑声。

“你们为什么不和她跳舞呢？”奥迪斯恨恨地喊道，“她更愿意换换口味。”

“哦，奥迪斯，”一个朋友说，“你好不容易才对上她的胃口。”

“你拿根棍子干什么，奥迪斯？”沃伦笑着问道。

“棍子？哦，这？这是一根球棒。等她出来的时候，我就一棒子把她敲进去。”

沃伦一屁股瘫坐在沙发上大笑了起来。

“放心吧，奥迪斯，”他终于能止住笑好好说话了，“这次我来救你了。”

奥迪斯假装突然眩晕了一下，把那根棍子递给沃伦。

“也许你用得上，老兄。”他粗鲁地说。

无论一个姑娘多么光鲜靓丽，如果不能被人频繁地邀请，那她在舞会上的处境就会十分尴尬。也许，比起那些曾经与他们跳过十几支舞的花蝴蝶，男孩子们倒宁愿她的陪伴。但是在爵士乐的滋养中长大的这一代年轻人生性喜怒无常，和同一个姑娘跳上多于一支完整的狐步舞虽然不至于十分厌烦，却会觉得索然无味。跳完几支舞，在中场休息的时候，她能十分确定，一个年轻人一旦摆脱她，就再也不愿碰她那任性的脚指头了。

沃伦和伯妮斯又跳完了一支舞，多亏有中场休息，他终于可以把她领到露台上的一张桌子旁。沉默片刻后，她扇着扇子开始了乏味的谈话。

“这里比奥克莱尔还热。”她说。

沃伦闷闷地叹了口气，点了点头。他对这种情景已早有预见。他心烦意乱，徒劳地想弄明白，是因为得不到关爱才使她不善交谈，还是因为不善交谈而使她得不到关爱。

“你还要继续在这里待下去吗？”他问道，接着脸就红了。她可能会怀疑他这样问她的初衷。

“还要再待一个礼拜。”她答道。她看着他，仿佛已经猜到他即将脱口而出的话。

他很不安。突然，他心软了，决定稍微恭维一下她。他回过头看着她的眼睛。

“你的嘴唇性感极了。”他平静地说。

这是他在大学舞会上，在如此刻般朦胧的灯光下，与女生们交谈时挂在嘴边的话。伯妮斯显然吃了一惊，羞红了脸，在扇子后显得很窘迫。以前，这样的话从来没有人对她说过。

“新鲜！”这个词脱口而出，她赶紧咬住嘴唇。然而，当她后来又表现出开心的样子，并对他报以感激的微笑时，为时已晚。

沃伦很烦恼。一般情况下，姑娘们不会把这句话当真，通常都会哈哈大笑或开几个打情骂俏式的玩笑。把这句话说成新鲜，除非是开玩笑，否则他不喜欢。他的怜悯之心消失了，他换了话题。

“吉姆·斯特兰和埃塞尔·德莫雷斯特总是坐在外面。”他说道。

这句话比较符合伯妮斯的风格。虽然话题的转变使她感到自在些，却也让她觉得有点遗憾。男人们不会和她聊关于嘴唇是否性感的话题，但她知道他们会和其他姑娘聊。

“哦，是的，”她说，然后笑了笑，“听说他们这几年都无所事事，身无分文。这样不是很傻吗？”

沃伦的厌恶之情又增加一层。吉姆·斯特兰是他哥哥的好朋友，无论如何，他认为嘲笑别人没钱是不礼貌的。然而，伯妮斯并非故意要嘲笑谁，她只是紧张而已。





二


深夜十二点半，玛娇丽和伯妮斯才回到家，她们在楼梯上道了晚安。虽然是表姐妹，但她们并不亲近。事实上，玛娇丽没有很要好的女性朋友——她认为女孩子都很蠢。伯妮斯和她正好相反。通过这次由父母安排的拜访，伯妮斯倒希望表姐抛开她的自信，而与她一起哭一起笑，她认为这是女性交往中不可或缺的因素。然而，她发现玛娇丽在这方面相当冷淡；在某种程度上，她觉得她与男人一样难以交流。玛娇丽从来不会傻傻地笑，从来不会感到害怕，几乎没有什么让她感到尴尬，事实上，她几乎不具有在伯妮斯看来比较得体且令人愉快的温柔品质。

这天夜晚，伯妮斯一边刷牙一边纳闷地想，为什么离家之后她就没有丝毫魅力了，这个问题她已经想了无数次了。她家是奥克莱尔的首富；她母亲为她考虑得极其周全。她每次去参加舞会前，母亲都会为她举办小型宴会，还给她买了辆小轿车，方便她随处走动，她从未思考过她在家乡的社交场上是如何取得成功的。和大多数女孩一样，她是喝着安妮·费洛斯·约翰斯顿准备好的“热牛奶”长大的。小说告诉她，女人受到钟爱是因为某种神秘的女性气质，而这种气质总是被人们津津乐道却从无人演示一下到底是什么样的。

伯妮斯现在不受青睐，这让她感到隐隐的不快。她不知道，假如不是玛娇丽努力相助，她整个晚上只能和一个男人跳舞；然而她也清楚，即使在奥克莱尔，那些地位不如她也没她标致的女孩却比她受欢迎得多。她觉得这是因为那些女孩身上隐隐约约地显露出某种不知廉耻的东西。她从不为此烦恼，如果她为此感到烦恼的话，母亲也会向她保证，其他女孩浅薄轻贱，而男人们真正倾慕的则是像伯妮斯这样的姑娘。

她关了洗漱间的灯，看见姨妈房间里的灯还亮着，便一时兴起，决定进去和姨妈约瑟芬聊会儿天。她穿着软底拖鞋，走路时悄无声息。她下楼走到铺着地毯的客厅，听到里面有说话声，便在半开半掩的门前停下脚步。接着她听到了自己的名字，她的确不是故意想偷听什么——房间里微弱的谈话声像针尖般突然刺穿了她的意识。

“她简直无药可救！”是玛娇丽的声音，“哦，我知道你要说什么！那么多人都告诉你她多么可爱，多么甜美，多么会做菜！那又怎样？她过得糟透了。男人们不喜欢她。”

“男人们的情趣是多么浅薄啊！”

哈维夫人的声音听起来很烦恼。

“你要是十八岁，那就意味着一切，”玛娇丽加强了语气，“我已经尽力了。我对她很客气，我让男人们请她跳舞，但是他们就是受不了她的沉闷。想到那样美丽的肤色浪费在这样一个傻子身上，再想想玛莎·凯莉会怎么做——哎！”

“现如今谦恭之风怎么都荡然无存了呢。”

哈维夫人的言外之意是，她已经无法理解现在的社会风尚了。她年轻的时候，所有出身良好的姑娘都过得非常开心。

“哦，”玛娇丽说，“没有哪个女孩能永远帮助一个傻亲戚，因为在这个时代，每个女孩都以自我为中心。我甚至想办法暗示她如何穿衣服，如何做其他事情，可她听了之后很生气——一脸滑稽地看着我。她很敏感，一定清楚地知道自己不会成功，但是我敢打赌，她准觉得自己很高尚而我太肤浅，太水性杨花，准没有好下场，并以此聊以自慰。所有不受青睐的女孩都是那么想的。酸葡萄！塞拉·霍普金斯认为我和吉纳维芙、罗伯塔都是交际花。我敢打赌，要是能变成交际花，让三四个男人同时爱上她，在舞会上每跳几步就有人插进来和她跳舞，她宁愿舍弃十年寿命以及她在欧洲所受的教育来交换。”

“我觉得似乎，”哈维夫人打断她的话，很疲惫地说，“你应该能为伯妮斯做点什么。我知道她不是很开朗。”

玛娇丽开始抱怨起来。

“开朗！上帝！除了很热、很拥挤或者明年她准备到纽约去读书外，我从没听她对男孩子说过其他什么话。有时候，她问他们开什么车，并告诉他们她开什么车。多么令人激动！”

沉默片刻后，哈维夫人继续耐着性子说：

“就我所知，其他女孩子都不如她甜美、有魅力，可她们都找到舞伴了。比如说玛莎·凯莉又矮又胖，又爱吵闹，她母亲也非常一般。罗伯塔·迪琳今年太瘦，看上去她似乎应该待在亚利桑那才是。她跳起舞来简直不要命。”

“可是，妈妈，”玛娇丽不耐烦地反驳道，“玛莎很快乐，很聪明，很机灵。罗伯塔的舞跳得棒极了。她受欢迎的时间已经有几个世纪那么长了！”

哈维夫人打了个哈欠。

“我想，这都是因为伯妮斯那该死的印度血统，”玛娇丽继续说，“大概她是隔代遗传。印度女人只知道呆呆地坐着，一言不发。”

“睡觉去吧，傻孩子，”哈维夫人笑起来，“要是知道这件事你会记得这么牢，我就不该告诉你了。我觉得你大部分的想法都很愚蠢。”她恹恹地结束了谈话。

又一阵沉默，而玛娇丽在想，如此费力地说服母亲是不是值得。你几乎永远无法改变四十多岁的人的思想。十八岁的时候，信念如可以放眼远眺的大山；四十五岁的时候，信念则如把我们隐藏得严严实实的深洞。

明白了这一点，玛娇丽便向母亲道了晚安。当她从房间出来进入客厅时，客厅里已经空无一人。





三


第二天，玛娇丽正在吃早餐，伯妮斯进来了，郑重其事地向她问好，在她的对面坐下，下意识地看着她，轻轻地润了润嘴唇。

“你在想什么？”玛娇丽十分疑惑地问。

伯妮斯停顿了片刻，扔出了手榴弹。

“我听到你昨天晚上对你母亲说我的坏话了。”

玛娇丽吃了一惊，神色稍微有点紧张，不过说话的声音依然十分镇静。

“在哪儿听到的？”

“在客厅里。我不是故意的——刚开始的时候不是。”

玛娇丽不禁流露出满脸鄙夷的神色，她垂下眼皮，开始饶有兴味地摆弄手上的玉米片。

“既然我这么让你讨厌——我想我最好还是回奥克莱尔去。”伯妮斯的下嘴唇抖得很厉害，她继续用颤抖的声音说，“我已经尽力表现得很友善，然而——然而，我首先被人忽视，接着又受人侮辱。我们家的客人，绝对不会受到这样的待遇。”

玛娇丽沉默不语。

“可是，我是个绊脚石，我明白。我拖累你了。你的朋友们不喜欢我。”她顿了顿，想起另一桩不开心的事，“当然，上个礼拜，你暗示我穿的裙子不合身，我很生气。难道你不认为我知道怎么穿衣服吗？”

“是的。”玛娇丽小声咕哝着。

“什么？”

“我没暗示什么，”玛娇丽简短地说，“我记得，我只说过，每天的穿着打扮都讲究一些比隔三岔五地讲究一次要好得多。”

“你觉得这样说很友好吗？”

“我没有想友好。”她顿了顿，接着说道，“你什么时候走？”

伯妮斯猛抽一口气。

“哦！”她带着一半哭腔。

玛娇丽吃惊地抬头看了看。

“难道不是你说要走的吗？”

“是的，可是——”

“哦，原来是吓唬人的！”

她们隔着餐桌对望了一会儿。伯妮斯泪眼汪汪，而玛娇丽则一脸决绝，就像过去神魂颠倒的大学生向她表白时她所惯有的表情。

“那么你是在吓唬人啦。”她重复着刚才的话，仿佛这正如她所愿。

伯妮斯涕泗横流地承认了。玛娇丽的眼神里透着无聊。

“你是我表姐，”伯妮斯抽泣着说，“我来看——看——看望你。我打算待一个月，况且，如果我提前回去，我母亲会知道，她会知——知道——”

玛娇丽等待着，直到伯妮斯断断续续的话语转为轻轻的啜泣。

“我会把我这个月的零花钱给你，”她冷冷地说，“随便你到哪里度过这最后一个礼拜。有家很不错的旅馆——”

伯妮斯的抽泣突然变成了风笛般的哭泣，她突然起身冲出房间。

一个小时后，玛娇丽正在书房专心写一封闪烁其词、捉摸不透、只有年轻姑娘才想得出的信，伯妮斯来了，她的眼睛红红的，情绪已经平静下来。她不看玛娇丽，随手从书架上拿本书，坐下来，俨然在看书。玛娇丽似乎沉浸于信中，不停地写着。当时针指向中午时，伯妮斯突然合上书。

“我想我最好去买火车票。”

这个开场白并不是她在楼上排练好的——这是她有勇气说出的最好的开场白，然而玛娇丽没有明白她的用意——没有劝她理智些，也没有说这一切都是误会。

“等等，等我写完这封信，”玛娇丽目不转睛地说，“我想赶快把它寄出去。”

她又唰唰地写了一会儿，然后回过头，松了一口气，带着一种“随你的便”的神情。伯妮斯不得不再次开口。

“你希望我回去吗？”

“呃，”玛娇丽若有所思地说，“希望，如果你过得不开心，那么最好走。没必要在这里受罪。”

“难道你就不想表达一点最起码的善意——”

“哦，请不要用《小妇人》中的腔调跟我讲话！”玛娇丽不耐烦地大声嚷道，“那已经不合时宜了。”

“你这么认为？”

“天哪，是的！现代女性怎么能像那些愚蠢透顶的女人一样生活？”

“我们的母亲们对她们可是怀有敬仰之心的。”

玛娇丽笑起来。

“是的，没错——也未必！另外，我们的母亲们在她们自己的世界里独善其身，但她们几乎不了解女儿们的问题。”

伯妮斯挺直了身子。

“请不要谈论我的母亲。”

玛娇丽笑了。

“我觉得我并没有提到她。”

伯妮斯觉得被人牵着鼻子走而偏离了主题。

“你觉得你对我好吗？”

“我已经尽力了。你是朽木不可雕。”

伯妮斯的眼圈红了。

“我觉得你心肠很硬，很自私，你没有一点女性的温柔。”

“哦，上帝！”玛娇丽绝望地叫道，“你这个蠢货！像你这样的女孩子只配拥有无聊平淡的婚姻；所有那些极其无能的表现都被你当作女性的温柔。一个有想象力的男人和一个身着华丽服饰、给予他无限遐想的女人结了婚，结果发现她只是一个虚弱不堪、哭哭啼啼、怯懦如鼠的矫情的混合体，那一定是一个沉重的打击！”

伯妮斯不知不觉目瞪口呆。

“有女人味儿的女人！”玛娇丽继续说，“她将全部的大好年华都用来谴责像我这样的女孩，殊不知，我们过得开心着呢。”

听着玛娇丽的话，伯妮斯的嘴巴张得更大了。

“丑女孩有理由抱怨。如果我是个无法改变容貌的丑女孩，我一定不会原谅父母把我带到这个世上来。然而你的人生完美无缺——”玛娇丽的小拳头握得紧紧的，“如果你想让我和你一起哭鼻子，你会大失所望。是走是留，悉听尊便。”她拿起信，离开了书房。

伯妮斯假称头疼，没有吃午饭。她们原本和人约好，下午要去看演出，但是伯妮斯的头还在疼，玛娇丽就向一个情绪还不算很低落的男孩做了解释。傍晚回来时，她发现伯妮斯在卧室等她，一脸严肃，让人捉摸不透。

“我决定了，”伯妮斯开门见山地说，“也许，你是对的——也许相反。但是，如果你能告诉我你的朋友们为什么不——不喜欢我的话，我想我会照你的话去做。”

玛娇丽对着镜子把头发抖落下来。

“此话当真？”

“当真。”

“毫无保留？乖乖听话？”

“呃，我——”

“呃什么！完全听我的话吗？”

“如果是合乎情理的事情。”

“不合情理！你不需要合乎情理。”

“你会——建议——”

“是，无所不包。如果我让你去上拳击课，你也必须得去。给家里写信，告诉你母亲，你要再待两个礼拜。”

“如果你告诉我——”

“好——我现在就给你举几个例子。首先，你举止不自然。为什么？因为你对自己的外貌从来都没有自信。如果一个女孩打扮得十分整洁得体，她就会忘记使她不自信的东西。这就是魅力。你越是忘我，就越有魅力。”

“难道我看起来不对吗？”

“是的；比如说，你从来不修眉毛。你的眉毛又黑又亮，然而你却任其乱蓬蓬的，这有损你的美貌。如果你把无所事事的时间拿出十分之一来修修眉毛，它们就会漂亮无比。你要用眉刷把眉毛刷直。”

伯妮斯疑惑地挑起了眉毛。

“你是说男人们会注意到眉毛？”

“是的——下意识地。你回家后，应该矫正一下牙齿。这些几乎是不起眼的细节，然而——”

“但是，我认为，”伯妮斯疑惑不解地插嘴道，“你很看不上女人这些细枝末节的事情。”

“我是不喜欢小心眼，”玛娇丽回答说，“但是女孩必须把自己打扮得精致有品位。如果她看上去优雅高贵，她才配谈论俄国、乒乓球，或者国际联盟，并可以所向披靡。”

“还有什么？”

“哦，这才刚开始！还有你跳舞的姿势。”

“我跳得不好吗？”

“是的，不好——你的身体应该靠近舞伴；是的，应该这样——稍微靠近点。昨天我们一起跳舞时，我注意到了这一点。你跳舞的时候，身子直挺挺的，你应该稍微前倾。或许，那些旁观的老女人会告诉你，你的仪态看起来多么庄重，然而，除非你是黄毛丫头，否则这种姿势对于男人，尤其是至关重要的男人而言就太过僵硬了。”

“继续说下去。”伯妮斯听得一头雾水。

“嗯。你还得慢慢学会对那些不善交际的男生和气点。除了和那些最受欢迎的男孩跳舞外，任何其他人和你跳舞都仿佛是对你的侮辱似的。哎，伯妮斯，我每跳几下，就会有人插进来——这些大都是什么人？哎，是那些不善交际的人。没有哪个女孩可以付得起忽视他们的代价。他们是任何群体中的大多数。过于腼腆而不善言辞的男孩恰恰是练习交谈的最好人选。而笨手笨脚的男孩是练习舞步的最佳人选。如果你肯尊重他们，表现出宽容的姿态，那么你就能在任何情况下应对自如。”

伯妮斯深深地叹了口气，然而玛娇丽还没有说完。

“如果你去参加舞会，想要真正快活起来，比如说，有三个不善交际的男孩子和你跳舞；如果你能和他们谈得非常愉快，他们就不会觉得被你缠住而脱不开身，那么，你就算是小有收获了。下次他们还会回到你身边，渐渐地，有很多不善交际的男人都愿意和你跳舞，那些富有魅力的男孩子就不会担心被你绊住——就会和你跳舞了。”

“没错，”伯妮斯由衷地说，她快要晕倒了，“我想我开始明白了。”

“最后，”玛娇丽总结道，“自信和魅力自然就有了。某天早上，你一觉醒来，发现你拥有了它们，男人们也会发现这一点的。”

伯妮斯站了起来。

“太感谢你了——但是以前，从来都没有人给我讲这些，太不可思议了。”

玛娇丽没有回答，只是神情严肃地注视着镜子里的自己。

“你太好了，这么帮我。”伯妮斯继续说。

玛娇丽依然没有回答，伯妮斯觉得是自己表现得过于激动了。

“我知道你不喜欢多愁善感。”她怯怯地说。

玛娇丽突然转过身来。

“哦，我没有那样想。我在想是不是最好给你剪个短发。”

伯妮斯一下子仰面瘫倒在床上。

下个礼拜三晚上乡村俱乐部有一个晚宴舞会。当客人们迈着散漫的步子走进来的时候，伯妮斯找到了她的座位卡，心中有些懊恼。尽管右边坐着G.李斯·斯托达德，一个最让姑娘们动心、最优秀的年轻单身汉，而最重要的左边却只有查理·鲍尔森。查理个子不高，不英俊，没有社交才能。伯妮斯根据刚刚受到的启蒙，断定他只有一项资本做她的舞伴，那就是他从来没有被她绊住而脱不开身过。然而那丝不快的感觉随着最后一道菜而消失了，她想起了玛娇丽对她的特别指导。她把骄傲吞进肚里，转身对着查理·鲍尔森，突然打开了话题。

“你觉得我应该把头发剪短吗，查理·鲍尔森先生？”

查理吃惊地抬起头。

“为什么？”

“因为我在想，这样做一定能够吸引人们的眼球。”

查理愉快地笑了。他不知道这些话是排练过的。他回答说他对短发没有研究，不过伯妮斯可以给他讲讲。

“我想成为社交场上的万人迷，你知道。”她冷静地宣布道，然后继续告诉他，把头发剪短是必要的前奏。她补充说，她想征求一下他的意见，因为她听说他对女孩子很挑剔。

查理丝毫不了解女人的心思，如同他不了解佛家弟子的冥思一样。伯妮斯的话让他多少有点飘飘然。

“因此，我已经决定了，”她继续说着，把声音微微抬高了些，“下个礼拜，我会早早地去市区的塞维尔旅馆理发店，坐在第一把椅子上，把头发剪短。”她的声音颤抖着，注意到周围一片寂静，大家都在专注地听她讲话；她感到一阵慌乱，不过，很快想起了玛娇丽传授给她的秘籍。她对周围的人又说了一段事先准备好的台词。“当然我要收入场费的，不过，如果你们都来给我鼓劲的话，我会给你们发入场券的。”

人群中发出一阵赞赏的笑声，G.李斯·斯托达德马上靠近她，悄悄地凑在她的耳边说：“我现在就订一个包厢。”

她迎着他的目光，嫣然一笑，仿佛他说的话非常精彩。

“你觉得短发很迷人吗？”G.李斯像刚才一样小声地问道。

“我觉得这不符合传统道德，”伯妮斯一本正经地承认，“但是，当然，你必须要么让人们开心，要么让人们满足，要么让人们震惊。”这是玛娇丽借用奥斯卡·王尔德的一句话。男人们又报以一阵笑声，而姑娘们则频频投来专注的目光。然后，仿佛自己没说什么机智俏皮的话，伯妮斯立刻转向查理，和他悄悄耳语。

“我想听听你对几个人的看法。我觉得你很会看人。”

查理一阵战栗，差点晕倒——他碰翻了她的水杯，他以这微妙的方式向她表达了他的敬意。

两个小时后，当沃伦·麦金泰尔精神萎靡地站在没有女伴的男人队伍里，心不在焉地看着跳舞的人们，正想着玛娇丽不知和什么人消失到哪里去了。这时，一种与他毫不相干的情景开始渐渐引起他的注意——这个情景就是，在刚刚过去的五分钟内，有好几个人插进去和玛娇丽的表妹伯妮斯跳舞。他把眼睛闭上，又睁开。他看到，在接下来的几分钟里，她一直在和一个外地来的男孩跳舞，这很容易理解：一个外地来的男孩不了解情况。但是，现在她又换了人，而查理·鲍尔森正朝她走去，他的眼神热情而坚定。奇怪——查理一个晚上很少和三个以上的女孩跳舞。

伯妮斯频频交换舞伴——沃伦着实大感意外——这个刚刚被换下来的人不是别人，正是G.李斯·斯托达德。可是，G.李斯·斯托达德看起来丝毫没有如释重负的兴奋感。当伯妮斯再次跳到沃伦身边的时候，他目不转睛地打量她。是的，她很漂亮，漂亮极了；而且，今晚她看起来容光焕发。她的这种神情，即使是最擅长模仿的女人也装不出来——她看上去玩得非常愉快。他喜欢她今晚的发型，她的头发熠熠发亮，他不知道她是不是打了发蜡。还有，那件连衣裙很合身——深红色把她的眼神衬托得更加深邃，也使她的面颊更加红润。他记得，她刚来时，他还不知道她缺乏情趣，他曾经觉得她很漂亮。没有情趣的感觉太不好了——没有情趣的姑娘令人难以忍受——不过她当然还是蛮漂亮的。

他收回了飘飘忽忽的思绪，又想起了玛娇丽。她这次的消失和以前的每次消失一样。当她现身时，他会问她去哪儿啦——她会郑重其事地告诉他这不关他的事。她吃定他了，多么不幸！她知道他绝对不会对城里的其他姑娘动心，因此，她很得意；她敢断定，即使是吉纳维芙和罗伯塔也不可能让他坠入情网。

沃伦叹口气。要想获取玛娇丽的芳心真是不容易，他就像困在迷宫中找不到出路。他抬起头，伯妮斯和那个外地来的男孩又跳过来了。他恍恍惚惚地离开了没有女伴的男人队伍，朝伯妮斯的方向迈出了一步，又犹豫了。然后，他对自己说，他这是在做慈善。他朝她走去——突然和G.李斯·斯托达德撞在一起。

“抱歉。”沃伦说。

但是G.李斯没有停下来致歉。他再次插进去，和伯妮斯跳起来。

那天夜里一点钟，玛娇丽一只手放在客厅的电灯开关上，转过身，最后看了看两眼放光的伯妮斯。

“那么，我们的计划奏效了？”

“哦，玛娇丽，奏效了！”伯妮斯大声叫道。

“我看你今晚过得棒极了。”

“是的，棒极了！唯一的问题是，大约到了半夜，我没词了，不得不重复说过的话——当然是对不同的人说的。希望他们不会相互印证。”

“男人们不会那么干的，”玛娇丽说着，打了个哈欠，“即使他们这么做了，也没关系——他们会认为你是个捣蛋鬼。”

她啪的一声关了灯。她们上楼的时候，伯妮斯激动地抓住楼梯扶手，心中满是感激。她还是平生第一次跳舞跳到累。

“你瞧，”玛娇丽在楼梯最高的一个台阶上说，“一个男人看到另一个男人插进来，就会认为你一定有不凡之处。好了，明天我们要搞点新花样。晚安。”

“晚安。”

伯妮斯一边把头发放下来，一边回想晚上的情景。她完全听从了玛娇丽的指点，即使查理·鲍尔森第八次插进来和她跳舞，她也装作很高兴的样子，表现得兴致勃勃、受宠若惊。她没有谈论天气、奥克莱尔、汽车或者上学的事，只谈论你、我和我们。

然而，就在她昏昏欲睡的时候，一个大胆的念头在她脑海里懒洋洋地翻腾起来——毕竟，是她自己做了这些事情。虽然所有的谈话都是玛娇丽教她的，这一点不可否认，然而，玛娇丽教她说的话大都是从她读过的书里抄来的。那条红裙子是伯妮斯自己买来的，虽然在玛娇丽把它从箱子里翻出来之前她从来都没有觉得它很好看——她用自己的声音说出了动人的话语，她用自己的嘴唇笑得那般甜蜜，她用自己的双脚跳出优雅的舞步。玛娇丽，好姑娘——但是，很虚荣——美好的夜晚——不错的男孩子们——像沃伦——沃伦——沃伦——他叫——什么——名字——沃伦——

她睡着了。





五


接下来的这个礼拜使伯妮斯大感意外。伯妮斯觉得人们真的渴望见到她，喜欢听她说话，她因此有了满满的自信。当然，一开始她频频出错。比如，她不知道德雷克特·德约正在研修牧师职位；她不知道，他来和她跳舞是因为他原本认为她是个文静、矜持的姑娘。如果她知道这些，就不会用这样的台词和他打招呼：“嗨，弹震症！”也不会给他讲洗浴的事——“夏天，要花大量精力盘头——头发太多了——所以，我总是先盘好头，再往脸上扑粉，再戴帽子；然后跳进浴缸，最后再穿裙子。难道你不认为这是最完美的做法吗？”

尽管德雷克特·德约正在苦苦钻研浸礼的事，因此有可能发现两者之间存在某种联系，然而，不得不承认，他并没发现。他认为谈论女人洗浴有悖传统道德，便向她表达了现代社会腐化堕落的观点。

然而，伯妮斯也取得了几个不同凡响的、值得称道的成就，抵消了这些不快的经历。小奥迪斯·奥蒙德恳求她允许他取消他的东方大学之旅，宁愿像忠诚的小狗一样追随她，这一方面令他的那帮朋友觉得好笑，另一方面又让G.李斯·斯托达德很恼火。有几个下午，G.李斯·斯托达德去拜访伯妮斯的时候，每次都遇到奥迪斯俯着身子，令人作呕地、含情脉脉地看着伯妮斯，使他的愿望泡了汤。奥迪斯甚至还给伯妮斯讲了木棍和女更衣室的事，意在向她表明，他和其他所有人起初对她的看法是多么荒谬。听到这些话，伯妮斯的情绪稍稍有些低落，但她还是一笑了之。

在伯妮斯所有的谈话中，最有名也最受人追捧的是那句关于剪短发的台词。

“嗨，伯妮斯，你打算什么时候去剪头发？”

“也许后天吧，”她会笑着这样回答，“你们会来看我剪头发吗？因为我可是对你们寄予厚望的啊，你们知道的。”

“我们会去吗？那还用说！不过，你最好快点！”

关于剪短发的事，伯妮斯完全没当回事，所以她会用大笑一次次搪塞过去。

“快了。保证让你们大吃一惊。”

然而，也许，伯妮斯获得成功的最重要的标志是，眼光极为挑剔的沃伦·麦金泰尔的灰色轿车每天都停在哈维家的门前。起初，听到他问起伯妮斯而不是玛娇丽，玛娇丽家负责应门的女佣非常吃惊；一个礼拜后，她告诉厨子，伯妮斯小姐抢走了对玛娇丽小姐忠心耿耿的小伙子。

伯妮斯小姐的确干了这件事。或许，一开始，沃伦只是为了激起玛娇丽的妒忌；或许，伯妮斯的言谈之间有着熟悉的玛娇丽的影子，虽然一时还难以觉察；或许，两者兼而有之，而且除此之外，还存在着某种真诚的爱慕之意。然而，无论如何，一个礼拜之内，年轻人们都知道了曾经对玛娇丽痴心不改的情郎令人吃惊地突然改变了主意，毫不犹豫地投入了玛娇丽的座上客的怀抱。眼前的问题是，玛娇丽将怎样接受这个事实。沃伦每天给伯妮斯打两个电话，给她写信，经常有人看见他俩一起坐在沃伦的跑车里，显然一次又一次地沉浸于严肃的、至关重要的、诸如他是否真诚之类的话题里。

当大家叽叽喳喳地拿这件事开玛娇丽的玩笑时，她也只是付之一笑。她说她很开心，沃伦终于找到一个欣赏他的人。因此，年轻人们也一笑了之，他们认为，玛娇丽并不在意，也就随其发展了。

伯妮斯结束拜访的日子快要到了，在离回家还有三天的那个下午，她在客厅里等沃伦，她要和他一起参加一个桥牌派对。她心情很好，当玛娇丽——她也要一起去——来到她身边，对着镜子不经意地梳着头发时，伯妮斯对即将爆发的风暴还毫无准备。玛娇丽用三句简短的话冷静而干脆利落地展开了攻击。

“你最好不要对沃伦痴心妄想。”她冷冷地说。

“什么？”伯妮斯完全蒙了。

“你最好不要在沃伦·麦金泰尔这儿丢人现眼。你在他心里什么也不是。”

她们对视片刻，双方剑拔弩张——玛娇丽面带嘲弄、高高在上；伯妮斯一脸惊诧，一半是出于生气，一半是出于害怕。就在这时，两辆小轿车开到了玛娇丽家的门前，一起鸣着喇叭。她们两人都轻轻地倒抽一口气，同时转过身，匆匆地走出屋子。

在整个牌局中，伯妮斯都在枉然地努力控制着越来越不安的情绪。她冒犯了玛娇丽这个狮身人面的女魔头。怀着世界上最正常不过的愿望，她在无意之中偷走了玛娇丽的财产。她突然觉得非常内疚。打完桥牌，他们随便围成一圈坐着，漫无边际地谈着话，风暴就在他们的谈话过程中慢慢酝酿成熟。小奥迪斯·奥蒙德无意间突然引发了这场风暴。

“奥迪斯，你什么时候再去读幼儿园？”一个人问道。

“我？伯妮斯剪头发的那天吧。”

“那么，你就别想再受教育了，”玛娇丽赶紧接上话茬，“伯妮斯只是随口说说而已，我以为你已经意识到了。”

“真的吗？”奥迪斯问道，责怪地看了伯妮斯一眼。

伯妮斯的两只耳朵在发热，同时，她想努力挽回局面。但是，面对这样针锋相对的攻击，她的想象力瘫痪了。

“世界上骗人的把戏多了去了，”玛娇丽继续得意地说，“你太嫩了，还不懂这些，奥迪斯。”

“好吧，”奥迪斯说，“也许是这样。但是，呃，就像伯妮斯说的——”

“真的吗？”玛娇丽打了个哈欠，“她最近都说了什么至理名言呀？”

似乎没人知道。事实上，伯妮斯近来把她的缪斯女神的情郎迷得神魂颠倒，竟没有说出任何值得铭记的东西。

“真的只是一句戏言吗？”罗伯塔好奇地问道。

伯妮斯踌躇着。她觉得她必须以某种方式表现出她的机智，然而，在表姐凌厉、冷漠的注视下，她完全丧失了能力。

“不知道。”她搪塞道。

“干脆点！”玛娇丽说道，“承认吧！”

伯妮斯看见沃伦的目光离开了他正在摆弄的尤克里里琴，用询问的眼神死死地盯着她的脸。

“哦，我不知道。”她依然重复着刚才的话。她的面颊在燃烧。

“干脆点！”玛娇丽又说道。

“说出来，伯妮斯，”奥迪斯催促道，“让她知道不该那么讲话。”

伯妮斯再次看向四周——她似乎无法离开沃伦的眼睛。

“我喜欢短发，”她飞快地说，仿佛在回答他的问题，“而且我打算把头发剪掉。”

“什么时候？”玛娇丽问道。

“随时都可以。”

“现在就最好。”罗伯塔提议。

奥迪斯跳起来。

“好极了！”他大声说，“我们要举行一个夏季短发派对。塞维尔旅馆理发店，记得你说过的。”

顷刻之间，所有人都站了起来。伯妮斯的心怦怦乱跳。

“什么？”她喘着气。

人群中传出玛娇丽的声音，非常清晰，非常不屑。

“激动什么呢——她要打退堂鼓了！”

“快点吧，伯妮斯！”奥迪斯叫道，开始向门口走去。

四只眼睛——沃伦的和玛娇丽的——都盯着她，向她挑战，公然地蔑视她。她再次剧烈地颤抖了一下。

“好，”她飞快地说，“不就是把头发剪短嘛。”

真是漫长的几秒钟！然后，伯妮斯坐在沃伦的副驾上，车子在暮色苍茫中驶向市区，其他人坐在罗伯塔的车里紧随其后。伯妮斯觉得自己就像坐在囚车里被押往断头台的绝代皇后玛丽亚·安托瓦内特一样。恍惚之中，她感到奇怪，她为什么不大声呼喊：这完全是个错误。她可以用两只手紧紧地护住自己的头发，来避开这个突然背离她的世界。然而她什么也没有做。甚至她母亲的意见也无法阻止她。这件事是证明她是否光明磊落的关键；也标志着她是否能步入无人能够撼动的、备受青睐的、星光璀璨的女孩阵营。

沃伦沉默不语，令人捉摸不透。到达旅馆的时候，他把车停在人行道边，朝伯妮斯点点头，示意伯妮斯先下车。坐在罗伯塔车里的一群人笑笑嚷嚷地下了车，涌进理发店。理发店的两扇厚厚的玻璃窗在街上特别醒目。

伯妮斯站在人行道上，看着理发店的牌子：塞维尔理发店。它的确是个断头台，而刽子手就是第一个理发师，他身穿白大褂，抽着雪茄，冷漠地靠在第一把椅子上。他一定听说过她的事；他一定在这把不祥的、经常被提到椅子旁没完没了地抽着雪茄等了她一个礼拜了。他们是不是要蒙住她的双眼？不，他们是要用一块白布勒住她的脖子，以免她的血——胡说——头发——落到她的衣服上。

“别担心，伯妮斯。”沃伦的语速很快。

伯妮斯昂着头穿过人行道，推开从两面都可以推拉的纱窗门，对坐在等候席上的那排喧嚣的看客们不屑一顾，径直朝第一个理发师走去。

“请把我的头发剪短。”

第一个理发师的嘴巴不由微微地张了张，嘴里的雪茄掉在了地上。

“啊？”

“我的头发——剪掉它！”

无须再啰唆，伯妮斯直接坐到高高的椅子上。邻座的一个男的侧身看了她一眼，分不清是激动还是惊讶。一个理发师吃了一惊，毁掉了每月理一次发的小威利·舒恩曼的发型。最后一把椅子上的奥雷利先生的脸被刮刀划破了，他哼了一声，用音乐般的古盖尔语骂起人来。两个擦鞋匠的眼睛瞪得大大的，朝她的双脚扑了过去。不，伯妮斯才不愿意让他们擦鞋呢。

外面，一个路人停下脚步，盯着她看；一对情侣也加入了看客的行列；五六个小男孩的鼻子突然伸到玻璃窗上，都被压扁了；人们的议论声一阵一阵地随着夏季的微风透过纱窗门，飘进理发店里。

“瞧，那个孩子长着那么长的头发！”

“你从哪儿弄的这东西？是他刚从那个长满胡子的女人脸上刮下来的。”

然而，伯妮斯什么也看不到，什么也听不到。她仅存的知觉告诉她，这个穿白大褂的男人把一把玳瑁梳子拿开，接着又拿开了一把；他的手指拿着他不熟悉的发夹笨拙地抓来抓去；她的头发，她的美丽动人的头发，消失了——她那闪着深棕色光泽的长发再也不会垂到背上，给她带来心醉的感觉了。顷刻之间，她几乎崩溃了，然后，眼前机械地出现了一幅画面——玛娇丽撇着嘴，带着含而不露的嘲笑，仿佛在说：

“放弃吧，认输吧！你想和我作对，我就揭穿你的老底。你瞧，你根本就不是我的对手。”

伯妮斯突然迸发出最后一丝力气，白布下面的两只手攥得紧紧的，眼睛里有一种令玛娇丽捉摸不透、久久难以忘怀的东西。

二十分钟后，理发师把椅子转过来，让她对着镜子。看到面目全非的发型，她害怕了。现在，她的头发不再卷曲有致，而是直挺挺地、毫无生气地贴在她那突然毫无血色的双颊上。难看极了——她早知道会这样。以前，她的魅力主要在于拥有圣母玛利亚般的娴静质朴。现在，这点魅力也不复存在了，而她——哎，变得相貌平平——不是像在演戏，就是让人觉着滑稽，活像一个找不着眼镜的格林尼治村妇。

她从椅子上爬下来，想挤出点笑容——不幸失败了。她瞥见两个姑娘交换了一下眼色；注意到玛娇丽嘲弄地撇着嘴——而沃伦的眼神突然之间变得冷若冰霜。

“你们看——”她突然感到一阵难堪，沉默了一下，“我做到了。”

“没错，你——做到了。”沃伦确认了她的话。

“你们喜欢吗？”

“当然。”有两三个人言不由衷地敷衍道。又是一阵令人难堪的沉默，然后，玛娇丽突然转过身，阴郁地紧盯着沃伦。

“介意把我送到洗衣店吗？”她问，“晚饭前我必须把裙子取回来。罗伯塔正好要回家，其他人可以搭她的车。”

沃伦心不在焉地看着窗外苍茫的夜色，突然冷冷地看了一眼伯妮斯，然后把目光转向玛娇丽。

“乐意效劳。”他缓缓地说。





六


直到晚饭前，伯妮斯看到姨妈吃惊的眼神，才完全明白她中了一个专门为她量身定做的、极其恶劣的圈套。

“为什么，伯妮斯？”

“我把头发剪短了，约瑟芬姨妈。”

“为什么，孩子？”

“你喜欢我的发型吗？”

“为什么，伯——妮斯！”

“我想我吓着您了。”

“你没有吓着我，只是明天晚上德约夫人会怎么想？你应该等到参加完德约家举行的舞会再去剪头发——如果你想将头发剪短的话，也应该等一等。”

“是临时决定的，约瑟芬姨妈。不过，这和德约夫人有什么关系？”

“哦，孩子，”哈维夫人大声说道，“她在上一次礼拜四俱乐部聚会上宣读了她的论文《年轻一代的怪癖》，她用了一刻钟的时间来谈论短发。这是她最厌恶的发型。而这场舞会是专门为你和玛娇丽举办的。”

“我很抱歉。”

“哦，伯妮斯，你母亲会怎么想？她会认为是我让你把头发剪掉的。”

“我很抱歉。”

吃晚饭是件令人苦恼的事。她急匆匆地想用卷发钳把头发打理一下，反而烫伤了手指，也烧焦了许多头发。她看得出姨妈又急又伤心，姨夫不停地说：“真是没想到！”他一遍又一遍地重复着这句话，带着一副反感和受到伤害的腔调。玛娇丽静静地、岿然不动地坐着，嘴角漾着一丝微笑，一丝嘲弄的微笑。

无论如何，她终于熬过了这个夜晚。三个男孩来访；玛娇丽和其中一个消失了，伯妮斯无精打采地试图取悦另外两个男孩，没有成功——当她十点半爬上楼梯回房间时，他们叹着气，算是对她的答谢。这一天糟透了！

她脱了衣服，准备睡觉，这时门开了，玛娇丽走了进来。

“伯妮斯，”她说，“关于德约家的舞会，我非常抱歉。我发誓，我把这件事忘得干干净净了。”

“没关系。”伯妮斯立刻说道。她站在镜子前，用梳子慢慢地梳着她的短发。

“明天我带你去市里，”玛娇丽继续说，“美发师会帮你补救，所以，你会漂亮起来的。我没想到你真的会把头发剪掉。真的非常抱歉。”

“哦，没关系！”

“不过，你就要走了，所以，我想关系不会太大。”

接着，玛娇丽把长发甩到肩上，开始慢条斯理地将头发编成两条金色的长辫子，然后穿上乳白色的睡衣，看起来就像一位优雅的撒克逊公主从画中走来。看着这一切，伯妮斯受伤的心瑟缩了一下。这两条沉甸甸的辫子越来越长，光彩熠熠，在玛娇丽灵活的指间绕来绕去，像两条躁动不安的蛇，伯妮斯羡慕极了。对伯妮斯而言，长辫子已经成为历史，等待她的是面前的卷发钳以及明天众人诧异的目光。她能预见到倾慕她的G.李斯·斯托达德端着哈佛大学生的派头，对和他一同进餐的人说，不该让伯妮斯看那么多电影；她可以看到德雷克特·德约和他母亲交换一下眼色，然后小心谨慎地、满怀同情地朝她走来。不过，也许等不到明天，德约夫人就会听说这件事；就会差人送来一封冷冰冰的短笺，要求她不要参加舞会了——她身后的所有人都捧腹大笑，而且都知道玛娇丽捉弄了她；她的美貌被一个自私的女孩因嫉妒而产生的怪诞念头毁掉了。她突然咬着两腮在镜子前坐下来。

“我喜欢这个发型。”她艰难地说，“我想这个发型很适合我。”

玛娇丽笑了。

“看上去很好。看在上帝的分上，别再烦恼了。”

“不会的。”

“晚安，伯妮斯。”

然而，就在门关上的那一刻，伯妮斯突然产生一个念头。她浑身是劲地跳起来，紧握拳头，悄悄地、迅速地走到床边，从床下拉出行李箱，把洗漱用品和一件换洗衣服扔进去。然后，她又打开大行李箱，迅速把两抽屉贴身内衣和夏天穿的裙子扔了进去。她动作麻利，没有弄出一点动静。三刻钟后，她锁上了大行李箱，捆上带子，她也穿戴整齐，一身合身的新旅行服，这是玛娇丽帮她挑选的。

她坐在桌子旁给哈维夫人写了封短笺，简明扼要地解释了回家的原因。她把信封好，写上收信人，放在枕头上。她看了看表，火车一点钟出发。她知道，如果她走过两个街区到达马尔堡酒店，就能很容易叫到出租车了。

她突然猛吸一口气，眼神突然变得十分诡异。或许，只有经验丰富的相面人才能看得出此刻的这个眼神和她坐在理发店椅子上时的那个决绝的眼神有某种模糊的联系——从某种程度上来说，此刻的这个眼神比那时的眼神还要让人捉摸不透。对伯妮斯而言，这是一个完全不同的眼神——它预示着某种后果。

她悄悄走到书桌旁，拿起放在上面的一件东西，关上所有的灯，静静地站着，直到眼睛开始适应黑暗。她轻轻地推开玛娇丽房间的门。她能听到玛娇丽平静、均匀、坦然的呼吸。

此时此刻，她已经走到玛娇丽的床边，从容而镇静。她动作非常麻利。她弯下腰，看到玛娇丽的一根辫子，她的手顺着辫子往上摸，一直摸到发根，然后稍微松了松手，免得这个睡梦中的人感觉到有人在拉她的辫子。她把剪刀伸进来，把辫子剪掉。她拿着辫子，屏着呼吸。睡梦中的玛娇丽咕哝了句什么。伯妮斯迅速剪掉她的另一根辫子，停了片刻，然后迅速撤离，悄悄地回到自己的房间。

她下了楼，打开大门，轻轻地把它在身后关上。她感到莫名地开心，欢快地走出门廊，投身到朦胧的月光里。她甩着手中沉甸甸的、购物袋似的辫子，迈着轻快的步子走了一会儿，发现左手依然抓着两根金色的辫子，她突然笑起来——她得把嘴紧紧闭上，以免失去控制笑出声来。现在，她正经过沃伦家，便一时冲动，放下行李，把两根辫子在手中来回荡了荡，像甩绳子一样扔到了木头做的门廊上，辫子在门廊上发出轻轻的撞击声。她又笑起来，开怀大笑起来。

“哈哈！”她狂笑不止，“自私的家伙！扒了你的头皮！”

然后，她提起箱子，在洒满月光的路上小跑起来。





离岸的海盗


一


这个不太可能发生的故事就发生在一个蓝色的梦一样的大海上，海面闪耀着蓝色丝袜般的色彩，在天空下如孩子的虹膜般碧蓝澄澈。太阳从西边的天空向海面掷下无数枚金色的小圆盘——细细看去，这些金色的小圆盘从一个浪头跳到另一个浪头上，然后汇入一片半英里宽的、金片粼粼的光带里，最终形成令人头晕目眩的夕阳晚照。一艘朝气蓬勃、气派豪华的白色汽艇大约就停泊在佛罗里达海岸和这金色的光带之间，在船尾蓝白相间的凉棚下面，一位金发姑娘斜倚在一把藤条扶手椅上，读着阿纳托尔·弗朗斯的《天使的反叛》。

她大约十九岁，身材曼妙，腰肢柔软，被娇宠惯了的小嘴十分迷人，灰色的眼睛无比敏锐，闪耀着好奇的神采。两只没穿袜子的脚搭在旁边另一把藤椅的扶手上，与其说是穿着倒不如说是装饰着一双蓝色缎面的拖鞋，拖鞋挂在脚趾上，优哉游哉地荡来荡去。她一边看书，一边时不时地用舌尖轻轻舔着手中的一半柠檬，以此来犒赏自己。另一半柠檬已经被她吸干，躺在她脚边的甲板上，随着细小得几乎感觉不到的海浪轻轻地晃来晃去。

手中的一半柠檬也快被她吸干了。金色的光带以令人吃惊的速度蔓延开来，汽艇被令人倦怠的寂静吞没。突然，一阵有力的脚步声打破寂静，一位身穿法兰绒西装的白发老人走上舱梯。他稍作停顿，等眼睛适应了甲板上的阳光后，他看见了坐在凉棚下面的姑娘，便开始没完没了地责怪起她来。

如果他打算用这种方式激起哪怕一点点反应的话，那他注定是要失望的。姑娘无动于衷地翻了两页书，又往回翻了一页，漫不经心地把柠檬举到她嘴可以够得着的地方，然后打了个虽然微弱却也十分显而易见的哈欠。

“阿蒂塔！”白发老人严肃地叫道。

阿蒂塔小声嘀咕了一句毫无意义的话。

“阿蒂塔！”他又叫了一遍，“阿蒂塔！”

阿蒂塔厌倦地举起柠檬，在把它送到舌尖上之前，随口说出了三个字。

“哦，闭嘴！”

“阿蒂塔！”

“怎么了？”

“能听我说话吗——或者，在我说话之前，要我先找个用人帮着你老实点吗？”

柠檬被不屑地、慢慢地放了下来。

“想说什么，就写下来吧。”

“能不能请您赏个脸抽出点儿时间，合上那本可恶的书，扔掉那该死的柠檬？”

“哦，难道你就不能让我清静会儿吗？”

“阿蒂塔，我刚接到一个岸上打来的电话——”

“电话？”她第一次表现出点兴趣来。

“是的，那是——”

“你是说，”她吃惊地打断他的话，“他们让你在这儿也接通了线路，以方便和外面联系吗？”

“是的，就在刚才——”

“难道别的船只不会撞上电线吗？”

“不会的。线路是铺在海底的。五分——”

“哦，多么了不起呀！天哪！科学等于金子或者诸如此类的贵重物件——对吧？”

“你能先让我把话说完吗？”

“说吧！”

“呃，这件事似乎——呃，我来这儿是——”他停下来，心神不宁地咽了几下口水，“哦，是这样的，我的年轻的大小姐，莫尔兰德上校再次打来电话，让我务必带你去赴晚宴。他的儿子托比大老远地从纽约赶来，就是为了见见你，他还邀请了其他几个年轻人。我最后一次问你，你是否愿意——”

“不，”阿蒂塔立即说道，“我不会去的。我和你一块做这次该死的巡游，只有一个目的，就是去棕榈滩，你知道的。我坚决拒绝去见什么该死的老上校，或者什么该死的小托比，或者任何一个该死的一大把年纪的年轻人，也决不踏进这个疯狂的州的任何别的什么该死的破城市。所以，你要么带我去棕榈滩，要么闭上嘴巴走得远远的。”

“好极了，我真是受够你了。你迷恋的这个人——他因为荒淫无度而臭名远扬，你父亲甚至不许他叫你的名字——你心里想的完全是荡妇们的作为，你就不想融入与你的出身相配的社交圈子。从现在开始——”

“我知道，”阿蒂塔讥讽地打断了他的话，“从现在开始，你走你的阳关道，我走我的独木桥。那件事，我以前听说过。你知道，我觉得这样再好不过了。”

“从现在开始，”他放出大话，“你不再是我的侄女了，我——”

“哟——哟——哟——哟嗬！”无可救药的阿蒂塔痛苦地大叫起来，“请你别再烦我了！请你滚开吧！请你跳到海里淹死去吧！你想让我拿书砸你，是吧！”

“如果你胆敢——”

啪的一声！《天使的反叛》隔空而过，差点砸到他的身上，欢快地跌落到舱梯口。

白发老人本能地后退一步，然后又小心地向前踉跄了两步。身材娇小的阿蒂塔跳起来，虎视眈眈地看着他，灰色的眼睛里燃烧着熊熊怒火。

“滚开！”

“你怎么敢这么讲话！”他怒吼道。

“因为我讨厌你！”

“你简直让人受不了！你的性格——”

“都是拜你所赐！没有谁生来就是坏脾气，都是家人的错！无论我怎么样，都是你造成的。”

她的叔叔小声嘀咕着，转身向前走去，高声喊着准备起航。然后他又回到凉棚下，阿蒂塔已经坐回藤椅里，继续吮吸她的柠檬。

“我要上岸去。”他缓缓地说，“今晚九点钟我还要出去一趟。等我回来，我们就出发回纽约，把你交给你婶婶，任你自生自灭。”

他不再说话，看着她，突然之间，她那稚气十足的美丽容颜下面有某种东西使他像泄了气的皮球一样怒气顿消。他显得无助、无所适从，像个十足的大傻瓜。

“阿蒂塔，”他不无亲切地说，“我不是笨蛋，我见得多了，我了解男人。而且，孩子，请相信，放浪形骸之人禀性难移，直到他们自己玩腻了才肯收手——到那个时候，他们也就失去了自我——只剩一副臭皮囊了。”他看着她，仿佛期望得到认同，然而却连一个眼神、一个字都没有盼来，于是只好接着往下讲。“也许，那个人爱你——这种情况也是有的。他爱过很多女人，而且他还会爱上更多。不到一个月以前，一个月，阿蒂塔，他卷入了一场性丑闻，他爱上了那个叫咪咪·梅丽尔的红头发女人；他答应把俄国沙皇送给他母亲的那只钻石手镯送给她。你知道的——你看过报纸。”

“忧心忡忡的叔叔炮制出骇人听闻的丑事，”阿蒂塔打了个哈欠，“拍成电影吧。下流的花花公子盯着高尚正直的姑娘。高尚正直的姑娘毫无疑问被他那可怕的过去吸引，打算去棕榈滩和他约会，忧心忡忡的叔叔却从中作梗。”

“你能告诉我到底为什么非要嫁给他不可吗？”

“我确定我说不出是什么原因，”阿蒂塔很干脆地说，“也许是因为在我认识的男人中，不管是好人还是坏人，他是想象力丰富并敢于追求梦想的唯一人选。也许是我想摆脱那些整天无所事事、满世界追着我跑的幼稚的傻瓜们。不过，关于那只著名的俄国人的镯子，你大可放心，他会在棕榈滩送给我的——如果你能表现得睿智一点的话。”

“那个——红头发的女人呢？”

“他已经六个月没有和她见面了，”她生气地说，“难道你认为我有那么高傲，非得在乎他的这点破事？难道你还不明白，到目前为止，我可以与任何该死的人做任何该死的事吗？”

她翘起下巴，宛如弗朗斯·阿劳斯特的雕像，然后，她举起柠檬，这个动作多少破坏了她那优雅的姿态。

“是不是那只俄国手镯让你神魂颠倒了？”

“不，我只是想给您提供点资料，好让您一展才华。希望您走开，”她说道，她又开始发脾气了，“你知道，我永远都不会改变主意。你已经折磨我三天了，我要发疯了。我不会上岸的！不会！听清楚了吗？不会！”

“很好，”他说，“那么你也休想去棕榈滩。你这个自私、放纵、疯狂、讨厌、让人忍无可忍的丫头——”

啪的一声！那半个柠檬砸中了他的脖子。与此同时，从船边传来了一声报告。

“准备起航了，法纳姆先生。”

法纳姆先生憋住一肚子的话和满腔怒火，用责备的眼神看了侄女一眼，转过身，飞快地下了舱梯。





二


太阳在时钟滚动到五点钟的时候，便无声无息地落入大海。金色的光带蔓延至一座光芒四射的小岛上；微风一直在和凉棚的流苏闹着玩，并不停地摇晃着一只悬着的蓝拖鞋，却不期然地送来一阵歌声。这歌声原来是配合默契、节奏悠扬的男声大合唱，船桨拨动着蓝色的海浪为它伴奏。阿蒂塔抬头谛听。

他们的膝头，

放着胡萝卜、豌豆和大豆，

猪在海里游，

幸运的人们！

大声吼啊吼，

为我们送来和风暖流，

为我们送来和风暖流，

为我们送来和风暖流！

阿蒂塔吃惊地蹙着眉头，静静地坐着，沉浸在歌声中，合唱团已经开始唱起第二段歌。

洋葱和大豆，

元帅和教授，

犹太老板和小鲜肉，

科斯特洛家也不落后。

大声吼啊吼，

为我们送来和风暖流，

为我们送来和风暖流，

为我们送来和风暖流！

她惊呼一声，把书抛向空中，书页散乱地趴在甲板上。她急忙来到栏杆处。在五十英尺远的地方，一艘大划艇正迎面驶来，划艇上共有七个人，其中六个人划船，一个人站在船尾，挥着一根指挥棒在为他们的歌声打拍子。

石头和牡蛎，

锯末和袜子，

谁能把大提琴

做成时钟的样子？——

乐队指挥的目光突然落在阿蒂塔身上，她正好奇地趴在栏杆上出神呢。他将指挥棒猛地一挥，歌声戛然而止。她注意到他是船上唯一的白人——那六个划船的都是黑人。

“喂！水仙花！”他彬彬有礼地喊道。

“你们这歌乱七八糟的，是什么意思呀？”阿蒂塔开心地问道，“你们这群乌合之众是从县城坚果园里来的吧？”

这时，划艇已经擦着游艇的一侧船舷，船头的一个黑人彪形大汉转过身，一把抓住舷梯。乐队指挥立即离开船尾，趁阿蒂塔还没有识破他的意图，迅速爬上舷梯，气喘吁吁地上了甲板，站在了她的面前。

“放了女人和孩子！”他果断地说，“立即把哭叫的婴儿淹死，用两条铁链捆住男人！”

阿蒂塔亢奋地将两只手插进裙子的口袋里，凝视着他，吃惊得一句话也说不出来。

他年纪很轻，黝黑而敏感的脸上镶嵌着一双如健康的婴儿般明亮的蓝眼睛，他的嘴巴像是在嘲弄人，乌黑润泽的头发打着卷——就像是把古希腊神像的头发直接染黑了一般。他外形俊朗，衣着整洁，似灵活的四分卫那般洒脱。

“哦，真见鬼！”她茫然地说。

他们冷眼相对。

“你要交出这艘船吗？”

“你是在开玩笑吧？”阿蒂塔质问道，“你是白痴呢——还是刚刚加入了兄弟会？”

“我是问，你是否要交出这艘船。”

“我想这个国家真是缺水了，”阿蒂塔轻蔑地说，“你是喝指甲油长大的吗？你最好从游艇上滚下去！”

“什么？”年轻人觉得难以置信。

“从游艇上滚下去！听清楚了吧！”

他看了她一会儿，仿佛在斟酌她的话。

“不，”他那张嘲弄人的嘴巴不紧不慢地说道，“不，我不会从游艇上滚下去的。如果你愿意，那就请便。”

他走到栏杆旁，一声令下划艇上的所有人便一窝蜂似的爬上舷梯，在他面前一字排开，一头站着一个粗壮的煤块似的黑人，另一头站着一个身高只有四英尺九英寸的小个子黑白混血儿。他们似乎穿着统一的蓝色服装，上面沾着灰尘和泥土，看起来破旧不堪；每个人的肩上都扛着一个看上去沉甸甸的白色小袋子，胳膊里夹着一个黑色的大盒子，里面显然装着乐器。

“立正！”年轻人发出口令，唰的一声并拢脚跟，“向右转！向前看！贝比，出列！”

最矮的那个黑人立即向前迈出一步，敬了个礼。

“是，先生！”

“由你指挥，到下面去，把船员抓住，捆起来——除了轮机手，把所有人都捆起来，把轮机手带过来见我。哦，把袋子堆到栏杆旁边去。”

“是，先生！”

贝比又敬了个礼，然后转身示意其他五个人围拢到他身边来。他们小声商量了一小会儿，便排着队静悄悄地下了舱梯。

阿蒂塔沉默地目睹着这最后的一幕情景，她吓坏了。“现在，”只听年轻人兴冲冲地说，“如果你愿意以一个小妞的名誉发誓——你的誓言可能也没什么价值——你能在四十八小时之内管好你那张刁蛮的小嘴儿，你就能划着我们的船逃到岸上去了。”

“如若不然呢？”

“如若不然，你就只能和我们一起出海啦。”

年轻人轻轻地舒了口气，因为一场危机风平浪静地过去了。他懒洋洋地摊着两只胳膊坐进了阿蒂塔之前一直坐着的那张藤椅里。他看着条状花纹的凉棚、光洁锃亮的铜管乐器、甲板上豪华的装备，嘴角露出了满意的微笑。他的目光落在那本书上，然后又落在那一半被吸干了的柠檬上。

“嗯，”他说，“斯通沃尔·杰克森说，柠檬汁可以醒脑。你的头脑很清醒吗？”

阿蒂塔不屑于搭理他。

“因为，在五分钟之内，你必须表明态度，是留还是走。”

他捡起书本，好奇地将它打开。

“《天使的反叛》。听起来不错。法语，哦？”他看着她，对她产生了新的兴趣，“你是法国人？”

“不是。”

“你叫什么名字？”

“法纳姆。”

“什么法纳姆？”

“阿蒂塔·法纳姆。”

“啊，阿蒂塔，不必站在那里咬嘴唇了。趁着你还年轻，你应该学着放弃那些紧张时的习惯。过来坐吧。”

阿蒂塔从口袋里掏出一个精雕细刻的翡翠盒子，抽出一根雪茄，点烟的时候，她故意摆出一副无所谓的样子，尽管她知道她的手在微微颤抖；然后，她袅袅娜娜地走过去，坐在另一张藤椅上，对着凉棚吐出一圈烟雾。

“你休想让我离开游艇，”她语调平稳地说，“而且，如果你认为你能溜之大吉，那你就大错特错了。六点半之前，我叔叔会用无线电波搜遍整个海面的。”

“呵。”

她不失时机地对他进行察言观色，她捕捉到他的嘴角挂着一丝忧郁和显而易见的焦虑。

“无论怎样，我都无所谓，”她耸了一下肩说道，“这游艇不是我的，我不介意出去巡游几个小时。我甚至愿意把这本书借给你，这样，你乘着这艘税收船去新新监狱的时候，还可以读读书。”

他嘲讽地笑起来。

“这个不用你费心。早在我知道有这艘船存在之前，我就已经计划好了，劫船只是我们计划中的一部分而已。反正，我们碰不到这艘船，就会碰到沿岸停泊的另一艘船。”

“你是谁？”阿蒂塔突然问道，“你是干什么的？”

“你决定不上岸了吗？”

“我压根就没有这样想过。”

“人们通常，”他说，“把我们七个人称作‘柯蒂斯·卡莱尔和他的六个黑人伙伴’，最近在‘冬日花园’和‘午夜狂欢’演出。”

“你们是唱歌的？”

“是的，但现在不是了。现在，由于你眼前的那些白袋子，我们成了逃犯，到目前为止，如果抓到我们所开出的赏金没有两万美元的话，就算我猜错了。”

“袋子里是什么？”阿蒂塔好奇地问。

“哦，”他说道，“我们暂时把它叫作——泥土——佛罗里达的泥土。”





三


柯蒂斯·卡莱尔和吓破了胆的轮机手谈了不到十分钟的话，“水仙花号”游艇便鸣着汽笛，在清香四溢的热带暮色中朝着南方出发了。那个小黑白混血儿贝比似乎是卡莱尔的心腹，局势完全由他掌控。法纳姆先生的贴身侍从和厨师被结结实实地捆在船舱里的铺位上。他们是船上除了轮机手之外仅有的船员，他们曾经反抗过，然而现在，他们正在进行重新权衡。块头儿最大的那个黑人特罗姆博恩·摩斯，提着一桶漆，正忙着把船头的“水仙花号”涂掉，用“呼啦呼啦号”取而代之，其他几个人聚集在船尾，开始起劲地玩起了双骰子游戏。

卡莱尔命人准备晚饭，并吩咐他们七点半在甲板上开饭。然后，他又来到阿蒂塔身边，躺进藤椅里，半闭着眼睛，开始恍恍惚惚地出起神来。

阿蒂塔仔细打量着他——她很快就认定他是个浪漫的人。他给人的感觉是，他那高度的自信是建立在微不足道的基础之上的——他的每一个决定背后恰恰暴露了他的犹豫不决，这与他的嘴唇那不可一世的曲线形成了鲜明的对比。

“他和我不是一类人，”她想，“反正有什么地方不一样。”

作为一个极端的利己主义者，阿蒂塔常常只考虑自己；她的利己主义从来都不容争辩，完全出于天性，而且完全无损于她那毫无争议的魅力。尽管十九岁了，但是她给人的印象却是一个早熟的神采飞扬的孩子，而且她目前的青春气息和美丽气质使所有认识她的男男女女倾倒，毫无例外地在她那一颦一笑的涟漪上随波逐流。她遇到过其他利己主义者——事实上，她发现，自私的人反而没有无私的人那么讨厌——然而，到目前为止，还没有一个人最终不被她征服，没有一个人最终不是服服帖帖地拜倒在她的石榴裙下。

然而，虽然她发现坐在旁边那把藤椅上的人是个自私的家伙，但是她却丝毫没有如平常那样要将其拒之门外的想法，没想到要采取行动来保卫船只；相反，本能告诉她，这个人在某种程度上完全处于弱势地位，非常不堪一击。当阿蒂塔向传统习俗发起挑战的时候——而且这是她近来最主要的乐趣所在——这主要是缘于她急于证明自我的强烈愿望，她反而觉得这个人也在一门心思地挑战着什么。

她对他的兴趣远远超出了她对自己的处境的关心，而她对他的兴趣就像一个十岁的孩子对一场午后的演出所可能产生的渴望。她对自己的处境毫不担心，她在任何情况下都可以把自己照顾好，她对自己的能力拥有无可置疑的自信。

夜深了。海上升起一轮苍白的新月，眼神迷离地微笑着，海岸的轮廓变得越来越模糊，最后渐渐地消失了。乌云像树叶一样在遥远的天边翻飞，朦胧的月光突然倾泻在乘风破浪的游艇上，将它的航线扩展成一条银光闪闪的大道。偶尔有人擦燃火柴点烟，明亮的火光一闪而逝。然而，除了引擎的转动声和海浪拍打船尾的哗啦声，游艇安静得仿佛一个梦，在群星闪耀的天庭里穿行。夜空中弥散着海的味道，营造出一种浩瀚无边的似水柔情。

终于，卡莱尔打破了沉寂。

“幸运的姑娘，”他叹口气，“我一直都想发财——然后来赢得这所有的美妙享受。”

阿蒂塔打了个哈欠。

“我宁可是你。”她坦率地说。

“你已经和我一样了——差不多一天了。不过，作为一个小丫头，你看起来的确很有胆量。”

“希望你别那么叫我。”

“抱歉。”

“关于胆量，”她从容地接着说道，“这可是我性格当中的一个可取之处。我天不怕地不怕。”

“嗯，我也是。”

“一般而言，”阿蒂塔说，“一个人要么非常伟大，非常坚强——要么就非常怯懦。可我两者都不是。”她顿了顿，语气开始变得热切起来。“但是我想谈谈你。你到底干了什么——你是怎么做到的？”

“为什么？”他以嘲弄的语气问道，“准备为我写部电影吗？”

“说说吧，”她催促道，“在这月光下，向我撒谎吧，编得精彩点。”

一个黑人来了，他把凉棚下面的一串小灯打开，开始摆放柳条桌，为晚饭作准备。食物是从下面应有尽有的食橱里拿上来的，他们吃着冷切鸡肉、沙拉、法国百合和草莓酱，卡莱尔开始打开话匣子。一开始，他显得迟疑不定，然而，他发现她听得津津有味，就兴致勃勃地讲起来。阿蒂塔几乎没怎么吃东西，她望着他那黝黑、青春的脸庞——帅气，带着嘲弄的表情，显得有些软弱。

他出生在田纳西州的一个贫困家庭，他说，家里一贫如洗，他们是那条街上唯一的白人家庭。他连一个白人孩子都不记得——但是，总是有十几个黑人小孩屁颠屁颠地追着他跑。他拥有生动、丰富的想象力，带着他们不断地招惹是非，然后再为他们平息事端，让他们逢凶化吉、摆脱危险。他凭着这些能力让这些孩子寸步不离地追随着他，热情洋溢地崇拜着他。似乎他们的这种友谊将他那不同凡响的音乐才华引到了一个奇异的轨道上。

有个黑人女士名叫贝尔·波普·卡尔霍恩，她在聚会上为白人孩子弹钢琴——这些白人孩子都出身良好，他们经过卡莱尔身边的时候，都对他嗤之以鼻。但是这个衣衫褴褛的“白人穷小子”常常坐在她的钢琴边，一坐就是很长时间，用一只别的孩子只能吹出一点声响的笛子努力吹出高亢的声音。十三岁前，他就开始在纳什维尔附近的小餐厅里用破烂的小提琴奏出生动而妙趣横生的雷格泰姆音乐。八年后，国内掀起了雷格泰姆热，他就带着六个黑人跟随奥芬马戏团巡回演出。其中有五个是和他一起长大的发小；另一个就是矮个子的黑白混血儿贝比·狄万，很久以前他在百慕大种植园里干活，后来他把一把八英寸长的匕首插进了庄园主的后背里，然后就逃到纽约附近的码头上干活。卡莱尔来到百老汇的时候才意识到自己的运气有多好，各方人士争相与他签约，他做梦都没想到能挣那么多的钱。

大约就在那时，他的整个心态发生了变化，这个变化非常奇特，非常痛苦。他意识到他和那几个黑人在舞台上叽里呱啦地浪费着人生的大好年华。他的表演算得上是出类拔萃了——三只长号，三只萨克斯管，还有卡莱尔的笛子——他拥有超常的节奏感，他的乐队正是因为这一点而变得不同凡响；然而他却产生了莫名其妙的厌恶情绪，他开始讨厌登台演出，而且厌恶之情与日俱增。

他们很能挣钱——他签订合同时，一次比一次要钱多。然而，当他去找经理人，告诉他们，他想与其他六个人分开而做一个普通的钢琴演奏者时，他们却嘲笑他，并对他说他疯了——这意味着艺术性自杀。事后他总是嘲笑所谓的“艺术性自杀”的说法。这个说法在当时很普遍。

有时候他们在私人舞会上演奏，一晚上能挣三千美元，可是似乎正是这些让他产生了对这种谋生方式的厌恶。他们去俱乐部和私人会所里演出，而他们在白天是登不了这些大雅之堂的。毕竟，他永远只是一个跳梁小丑，一个被艺术化了的乐队的乐手而已。他一闻到剧院和脂粉的味道，一听到演员休息室里的闲言碎语，一看到包厢里那些看客高高在上的恭维之态，他就觉得恶心。他再也无法心无旁骛地演奏了。他想慢慢过上休闲的豪华生活，这个想法使他发疯。当然，他正在朝这个目标努力。不过，这个过程太漫长了，就像小孩子吃雪糕，因为吃得太慢，所以根本无法享受到它的美味。

他想有很多钱、很多时间，想有机会读书和消遣，想成为他周围那些他以前从来都无法跻身其中的男男女女——这些人就算是曾经想到过他的话，也认为他是个无足轻重的卑劣之人。简单地说，他想拥有那些贵族们才能享有的东西，这样的贵族似乎是可以用金钱来交换的，只是他辛苦演出赚来的钱除外。那时他二十五岁，没有成家，没有上过学，也没有希望在生意上取得成功。他开始疯狂地做投机生意，不到三个礼拜，便把所有积蓄败得精光。

然后，战争爆发了。他去了普拉茨堡。即使到了那里，他也摆脱不掉自己的职业。一位陆军准将把他叫到军部，告诉他，如果他去当军乐团的团长，可以为国家做出更大的贡献——于是，整个战争期间，他和军乐团一起待在后方为各类社会名流演出。这也没什么不好——然而，当步兵们一瘸一拐地从战壕里回来的时候，他很想成为其中的一员。他们身上的泥土和汗水散发着永恒的魅力，对他而言，这似乎是不可企及的贵族品质的一种象征。

“是私人舞会造成的。我从战争中归来以后，又开始重操旧业。我们收到了佛罗里达酒店财团的邀请。当时，这只是迟早的问题。”

他停下不说了，阿蒂塔满怀期待地望着他，然而，他摇摇头。

“不，”他说，“我不打算给你讲了。我非常珍惜这些经历，生怕与别人分享后会有损它带给我的快乐。我想把这些惊心动魄的英勇时刻埋藏在心底，等我在他们面前出人头地的时候，我要让他们知道，我不只是个上蹿下跳、扯着嗓子吼叫的小丑。”

忽然甲板上传来一阵低回的歌声，黑人们聚集在甲板上齐声歌唱，旋律令人难忘，尖锐的和声飞向了月亮。阿蒂塔听得如痴如醉。

哦，走吧——

哦，走吧，

妈咪要带我看银河，

哦，走吧，

哦，走吧，

爸比说明天去，

妈咪说今天去，

没错——妈咪说今天去！

卡莱尔叹了口气，沉默了一会儿，抬头望着温暖的天空下那如弧光灯般闪烁的点点繁星。黑人们浑厚的歌声渐渐变成如泣如诉的哼唱，而天地似乎越来越寂静，光明也在分分秒秒地迫近。他几乎可以听见美人鱼夜半梳妆的声音，她们在月光下梳着湿漉漉的、闪着银光的鬈发，聊着她们的住所，聊着在泛着清辉的大道下面那艘精致的沉船。

“你看，”卡莱尔轻轻地说，“这就是我想要的美妙享受。必须是那种令人吃惊、令人震撼的美——必须像梦、像少女动人的眼眸一样，突然闯入你的生活。”

他转过身来望着她，而她却默默无语。

“你明白，不是吗，阿蒂塔——我的意思是，阿蒂塔？”

她依然没有回应。她已经不知在什么时候睡熟了。

第二天中午，艳阳高照，前方海面上的一个小斑点不期然地变成了一个深绿色的小岛。它的北面显然是一面巨大的花岗岩峭壁；南面是一个斜坡，斜坡上面有一片一英里长的矮树林和草地，焕发着勃勃生机；紧接着的是一片沙滩，慵懒地沉浸在海浪里。阿蒂塔坐在自己最喜爱的座位上看书，《天使的反叛》已经翻到了最后的一页。她砰的一声合上书，抬起头看到了那个小岛，轻轻地发出一声欢呼，对着心事重重地站在栏杆边的卡莱尔喊起来。

“是这里吗？这就是你要去的地方吗？”

卡莱尔漫不经心地耸了耸肩。

“你可难住我了。”他抬高了声音，叫代理船长：“喂，贝比，你是要去这个岛吗？”

那个黑白混血儿的小脑袋从甲板房的拐角处伸了出来。

“是的，先生！就是这个岛。”

卡莱尔和阿蒂塔搭起话来。

“看起来这是个娱乐的好去处，是吗？”

“是的，”她表示赞同，“但是看起来似乎不够大，不能作为藏身之所。”

“你还对你叔叔用来搜索海面的无线电深信不疑吗？”

“不，”阿蒂塔坦率地说，“我完全站在你这边，真心希望你能成功地逃走。”

他大笑起来。

“你是我们的幸运女神。想想看，我们必须带着你，让你作为我们的吉祥物——无论如何，目前是这样的。”

“你最好不要让我游回岸上去，”她冷冷地说，“如果你要这么做，我就写一部廉价小说，把昨天晚上你没完没了地讲给我听的故事写进去。”

他的脸唰地红了，显得有点拘谨。

“抱歉，我让你感到厌烦了。”

“哦，我没有感到厌烦——只不过结尾应该加上，你因为不能和那些看你表演的优雅女士们跳舞而感到非常愤怒。”

他生气地站了起来。

“你真是个大嘴巴。”

“对不起，”她笑得浑身瘫软地说，“不过，我还不习惯让男人们用他们自己雄心勃勃的人生故事来取悦我——如果他们过着这般生不如死的柏拉图式的生活，就更是如此。”

“为什么？男人们通常都拿什么来取悦你？”

“哦，他们谈论我，”她打了个哈欠，“他们说我是年轻貌美的精灵。”

“那你是怎么回答的？”

“哦，我沉默地表示赞同。”

“你见到的每个男人都对你说他爱你吗？”

阿蒂塔点点头。

“为什么不该这么说？人生无非就是围绕着‘我爱你’这句话——进进退退。”

卡莱尔笑着坐下来。

“非常正确。这个——这个想法不错。这是你想出来的吗？”

“是的——更确切地说，是我体会出来的，没什么特别的，只是一点心得而已。”

“是一种感悟，”他严肃地说，“代表了你们这个社会阶层的特征。”

“哦，”她不耐烦地打断他的话，“别再发表你那贵族言论了！我不喜欢一大早就这么紧张兮兮的人。这时候应该稍微有点发狂——是那种饿得发慌、非常想吃早饭的感觉。清晨是睡觉、游泳和什么都不想不顾的时间。”

十分钟后，他们兜了一大圈，好像是从北面靠近了小岛。

“好像有人在捣鬼，”阿蒂塔若有所思地说，“他怎么会把船停在悬崖边呢。”

此刻，他们正朝着坚硬的石崖径直驶去，这个悬崖准有一百多英尺高。在他们离悬崖只有不到五十码远的时候，阿蒂塔才看清楚他们行驶的目标，于是，她高兴地拍起手来。悬崖中有一道缝，完全被一块奇异的岩石遮掩，游艇驶入石缝，沿着一道狭窄的、晶莹剔透的水面在两堵灰色的高墙间缓缓行驶。然后，他们把游艇泊在一个金色的小海湾里，这个海湾水平如镜，周边点缀着矮矮的棕榈树，简直像孩子们在沙堆上用树枝和镜子垒砌的镜湖。

“还不是那么糟糕！”卡莱尔兴奋地喊道，“我想那个小浣熊(1)对大西洋的这片海域了如指掌。”

他的热情具有传染性，阿蒂塔也兴奋起来。

“这是个绝对安全的藏身之处！”

“天哪，对极了！这就是小说中描写的那种岛屿！”

他们把划艇放到金色的水面上，再把它停靠到岸边。

“快点，”当他们从划艇上下来踏上湿软的沙滩时，卡莱尔说，“我们去探险吧。”

棕榈树林被一片平坦的沙土地环抱着，这片沙土地大约有一英里长。他们沿着沙土地向南走，穿过热带植被，便来到了像珍珠一样白的沙滩上，这片白沙滩还是一片处女地。阿蒂塔踢掉棕色的高尔夫鞋——她似乎永远都不穿袜子——去蹚水了。然后，他们悠然地回到游艇上，不知疲倦的贝比已经为他们准备好午饭了。他已经事先在北面峭壁的高处设置了瞭望哨，可以从岛屿的两侧观察海上的动静。虽然他也怀疑这个峭壁处的入口是不是已经广为人知——然而，他至今都没有看见过有一张地图标出过这个小岛。

“它叫什么名字？”阿蒂塔问道，“我是指这个小岛。”

“根本没有名字，”贝比咯咯地笑起来，“它不就是个岛嘛。”

傍晚，他们背靠着峭壁最上面的大石头，卡莱尔向她勾勒着他不成熟的蓝图。他确信，此时此刻人们一定在极力追捕他。由他指挥完成的这次劫船行动的全部所得，以及与此相关的情况，他依然拒绝向她透露，他估计差不多应该有一百万美元。他希望在这里待上几个礼拜，然后向南进发，巧妙地避开寻常航线，绕过合恩角，驶往秘鲁的卡亚俄。至于游艇所需的燃煤以及船上的供给，这些琐事就完全交给贝比去处理。贝比似乎能胜任海上航行的所有角色，从船上的侍者到咖啡交易商，甚至是船长早已被绞死的巴西海盗船的大副，他都无所不能。

“如果他是个白人，他可以当上古代的南美国王。”卡莱尔强调说，“至于聪明才智，他可以让布克·T.华盛顿看起来像个傻瓜。他拥有各个种族和民族的智慧，他的血管里至少流淌着六个民族和种族的血，否则，我就是骗子。他崇拜我只是因为我是世界上唯一一个演奏雷格泰姆比他好的人。我们经常一起坐在纽约海边的码头上，他吹巴松管，我吹双簧管，我们把小调和有千年历史的非洲和声糅合起来。我们的乐声把老鼠引出洞，它们爬到树桩上，围成一个圈吱吱乱叫，就像狗绕着留声机呜呜乱叫一样。”

阿蒂塔大笑起来。

“你怎么编得出来！”

卡莱尔咧着嘴笑了。

“我发誓那是传——”

“你到卡亚俄后有什么打算？”她打断了他的话。

“乘船去印度。我想当个王侯。我是认真的。我还想在阿富汗找个地方，买座宫殿，赚个好名声，然后，大约五年后，带着外国口音和神秘的过去出现在英国。不过，要先去印度。你知道吗，据说世界上所有的金子都慢慢地流向了印度。这一切都让我着迷。而且，我还想悠游自在地读书——读很多很多书。”

“之后呢？”

“之后，”他带着挑战的神气回答道，“就该谈谈贵族的问题了。如果你想笑就笑好了——但是，至少，你必须承认，我知道我需要的是什么——我比你想象丰富。”

“恰恰相反，”她一边伸手到衣袋里摸烟盒，一边反驳道，“遇见你的时候，我正在被亲戚朋友们狂轰滥炸，因为我的确知道我想要的是什么。”

“你想要的是什么？”

“一个男人。”

他大吃一惊。

“你的意思是你订婚了？”

“算是吧。昨天晚上如果你没有登上这艘游艇，我也一定会想尽一切办法溜上岸的——这似乎是很遥远的事了——去棕榈滩和他会面。他拿着一只俄国凯瑟琳女皇戴过的镯子在那儿等我。现在，和贵族有关的事，一句也别再提了。”她语速很快，“我喜欢他，只是因为他有想象力，有十分坚定的信念。”

“但是你的家人不同意，是吗？”

“哪里是什么家人——只是一个白痴的叔叔和一个更白痴的婶婶。似乎他和一个叫什么咪咪的红头发女人卷入了一场丑闻——这件事被夸大得离谱，他说，男人们不会对我撒谎——无论如何，我不在乎他做了什么；未来才是最重要的。而且我在乎的也是将来。当一个男人爱上我的时候，他就不会再有别的乐趣。我让他把她像块烤饼一样丢掉，他做到了。”

“我很嫉妒。”卡莱尔皱着眉头说，然后笑起来，“我想我会让你和我们在一起，一直到卡亚俄。然后，我借给你足够的钱，让你回美国。那个时候，你才会有空想你的那位绅士。”

“不要那样和我说话！”阿蒂塔发火了，“我不会忍受任何人的霸道态度！你了解我吗？”

他呵呵地笑起来，紧接着非常尴尬地止住笑声，因为她的愤怒是那般寒意袭人，似乎将他团团裹住，让他感到恐惧。

“抱歉。”他迟疑地想表示友好。

“哦，不要道歉！我受不了男人们用那副霸气、不情不愿的腔调说‘抱歉’。闭嘴就行了。”

接下来是一阵沉默，这阵沉默让卡莱尔感到非常难堪，而阿蒂塔却似乎毫不在意，她自得其乐地坐在那里享受着她的香烟，看着远处波光粼粼的海面。过了一会儿，她向外面爬去，趴在岩石边向下看。卡莱尔看着她，心里想着，她怎么能做出这么不雅的姿态。

“哦，快看！”她喊道，“下面有很多暗礁。很宽阔，高度都不同呢。”

他爬过来，和她一起往下看，这里离海面的距离很远，令人头晕目眩。

“今晚我们去游泳吧！”她兴奋地说，“在月光下。”

“你难道不想到沙滩那边去吗？”

“一点都不想，我喜欢跳水。你可以穿我叔叔的泳衣，只不过，它穿在你身上像个大麻袋，因为他很胖。我有一件连体式泳衣，它使大西洋沿岸的所有当地人都感到震惊，从比迪福德·普尔到圣奥古斯丁，无一例外。”

“我想你像一条鲨鱼。”

“没错，我厉害着呢，而且我看上去又娇俏可爱。去年拉伊的一位雕刻家对我说，我的腿肚价值五百美元呢。”

关于这个问题，似乎没有答案，因此卡莱尔没有作声，只是谨慎、含蓄地笑了笑。





五


夜幕降临，朦胧的蓝色天空笼罩着一个月光涤荡的银白世界。他们划着小船穿过那条狭窄的、银光闪闪的水带，然后把它系在一块凸出的石头上，开始一起朝悬崖上攀登。第一道石台在十英尺高的地方，很宽阔，是天然形成的跳水台。他们坐在皎洁的月光下，看着水面上微微荡漾、绵绵不绝的波浪。现在是退潮的时候，水面几乎风平浪静。

“你开心吗？”他突然问。

她点点头。

“在海边总是很开心的，你知道的，”她接着说，“我一整天都在想，你和我还是有点像的。我们俩都很叛逆——只是原因不同而已。两年前，我还只有十八岁，而你——”

“二十五岁。”

“——哦，我们两人当时都应该属于传统意义上的成功者。我当时是初露头角的社交界名媛，而你是前程似锦的乐手，而且还负有军人的神圣使命——”

“算是经过国会法案认可的绅士了。”他揶揄地说。

“好吧，不管怎样，我们俩挺有默契。假如我们的棱角没有被磨去，至少也受到了束缚。然而我们的内心深处都隐藏着某种东西，它让我们为了幸福而孜孜追求。我不知道我想要的是什么。我在男人之间穿梭，我的心无法停留，我烦躁不安，我的不满与叛逆情绪逐月剧增。我常常咬着两腮坐在那里，心想我要发疯了——我强烈地感到，一切都稍纵即逝。因此，我想要留住现在——现在——现在！我活着——很漂亮——我很漂亮，是吗？”

“是的。”卡莱尔小心翼翼地附和着说。

阿蒂塔突然站起来。

“等会儿。我想跳进这赏心悦目的大海里。”

她走到石台边，纵身跳向海面，她在空中翻了个筋斗，然后再把身体舒展开，像打开一把折叠刀后再把刀锋垂直掷入水面一般，动作干净利落，完美无瑕。

过了一会儿，她的声音飘到了他的耳朵里。

“你知道，我过去常常没日没夜地读书，我开始憎恨社会——”

“快上来吧，”他打断她的话，“你到底在做什么？”

“就躺在水上玩啊。我一会儿就上去。我告诉你，我唯一的乐趣就是惊世骇俗：穿着奇装异服风情万种地去参加化装舞会，在纽约与花天酒地的男人们周旋，在那些最难以想象的地狱般的摩天大楼里进进出出。”

她的声音和水花飞溅的声音混合了起来，接着，他听见了她急促的呼吸声，她已经爬到石台边了。

“该你跳了！”她大声说。

他顺从地起身跳了下去。当他浑身湿透地浮出水面往上爬的时候，发现她已经不在石台上了，他感到一阵恐惧，却忽然看见她正在上面十英尺高的另一个石台上开心地笑呢。他也爬了上去。两个人抱着膝盖，静静地坐着喘息了一会儿，以平复攀爬时产生的疲劳。

“我的家人真是疯了，”她突然说，“他们总想把我嫁出去。然后当我开始觉得活着几乎没什么意思的时候，却有了意外的发现——”她惊喜地望着天空。“我有了意外的发现！”

卡莱尔倾听着，她又连珠炮似的讲起来。

“勇气——就是勇气；勇气就是生活的准则，是我们一直要坚持的东西。我开始对自己拥有坚不可摧的信心。我开始明白，在我过去所有的偶像之中，一直在不知不觉中吸引着我的就是他们勇敢的行为。我开始把勇气与生活中的其他东西中区分开来。各种各样的勇气——那个遍体鳞伤、浑身是血的职业拳击手，并不只是为了打拳——我常常让男人们带我去看职业拳击赛；那个下等社会的女人从一窝小猫身边经过的时候，她看这些小猫的眼光，就好像它们是她鞋底的一团泥巴似的；永远要称心如意地活着，一点都不要考虑别人会怎么想——我爱怎么活就怎么活，爱怎么死就怎么死——你带烟了吗？”

他递给她一支烟，轻柔地为她点上火。

“然而，”她继续说，“尽管我身心疲惫，那些男人——不管年老的还是年轻的——他们大多数人都强烈地想占有我，想占有我为自己建立起的那种无比高贵的骄傲。你听明白了吗？”

“有点明白了。你从不言败，从不后悔。”

“从不！”

她跑到岩石边，摆好姿势，保持了一会儿，就像半空中的一幅耶稣受难像；然后她当空画了一道黑色的抛物线，不着痕迹地落入二十英尺下的两道银色的水波之间。

她的声音又朝他飘了过来。

“对我来说，勇气意味着冲破笼罩着生命的那层沉闷的浓雾——它凌驾于人和环境之上，而且可以不把生活的黯淡放在心上。它是对人生价值的一种坚持，是事物转瞬即逝后价值的延续。”

现在她正在向上爬，说完最后一句话，她的头便出现在他的面前了，她那湿漉漉的金发光滑而均匀地披在身后。

“话是都不错，”卡莱尔提出反对意见，“你可以称之为勇气，但是毕竟你的勇气实际上是建立在你那骄傲的出身上的。你生来就有敢冒天下之大不韪的态度。在我灰暗的日子里，甚至连勇气都是灰暗的、死气沉沉的。”

她坐在岩石边，抱着膝盖，心不在焉地望着洁白的月亮；他在后面很靠近石壁的地方坐着，活像被挤进岩石内的一尊怪诞的神像。

“我不想让人误认为我是盲目乐观之人，”她说道，“但是你还没有听懂我的意思。我所说的勇气指的是信心——是坚持到底的信心——直到快乐主动送上门，还有希望和本能的冲动。在事情还没有如我所愿地发生之前，我决不会改变心意，我会紧紧地闭上嘴巴，高高地昂起头，睁大我的眼睛——你没必要傻笑。啊，我一直在地狱里穿行，可我不会时不时地发出惨叫——而且女人的地狱比男人的地狱更加残酷无情。”

“但是，假如，”卡莱尔提示道，“在快乐、希望和所有的一切到来之前，命运的帷幕就永远地拉上了，该怎么办？”

阿蒂塔站起身来，走到石壁边，费力地向下一个十到十五英尺高的石台攀去。

“喂，”她扭着头大声说道，“我一定会赢的！”

他走到岩石边，才看到她。

“最好不要从那里往下跳！你会摔断脊梁骨的。”他急忙说。

她笑起来。

“才不会呢！”

她慢慢地张开双臂，像一只美丽的白天鹅一样立在那儿，她那青春而完美的身躯散发着骄傲的光芒，卡莱尔的心头燃起一团温暖的火花。

“我们一起张开双臂穿越这黑暗的空气吧，”她大声说，“我们把双腿也绷直，像海豚的尾巴一样，心里想着，我们永远都触不到那银色的水面，直到温暖的海水把我们突然包围，无处不在的小小水浪轻轻地亲吻着、爱抚着我们的身体。”

说话之间，她已经在空中了，卡莱尔不由自主地屏住了呼吸。他还没有意识到这一跳的高度几乎有四十英尺。时间仿佛凝固了，直到他听见她猛然撞击海面而发出的落水声。

直到她那快乐的、含着水珠的笑声打着旋飘上悬崖，传到他那紧张的耳朵里时，他才高兴地舒了一口气。这时，他才意识到他爱上她了。





六


他们随心所欲地在岛上度过了三个下午。天亮后一个小时，阳光照进阿蒂塔的客舱悬窗里，她心情愉悦地起了床，穿上泳衣，走上甲板。黑人们一看见她，便放下手中的活计，挤到栏杆边，有说有笑地看她游泳。她像一只灵活的小米诺鱼在清澈的海水里游动，她一会儿浮出水面，一会儿潜入水底。在一个凉爽的下午，她又要去游泳——她和卡莱尔要么在石崖上懒洋洋地抽烟；要么就侧卧在小岛南面的沙滩上，几乎不说话，望着漫天的彩霞渐渐地、令人惋惜地被那浩渺而温柔的热带夜色代替。

在这漫长的、阳光灿烂的日子里，阿蒂塔渐渐忘却了她那突发奇想的、荒诞的约会，忘记了那个在枯燥的现实中萌生出的爱情苗头。她怕他取消南行计划；她怕亲眼看到他们发生意外；突然之间，思考变得令人烦恼，决定变得令人讨厌。假如她不是基督教徒，她可以让心灵祈祷，只求人生暂时脱离苦海，就这样懒懒地依着卡莱尔一时的心血来潮，顺着他那敏锐的、异想天开的想法，跟随他孩子气的、天马行空的想象，任凭偏执在他的血管里流淌，并影响他的一举一动。

然而这并不是一座岛、两个人的故事，也并非两个孤男寡女单独待在一起就能产生爱情。这只是两个人性情的自然流露，而且偶遇了这墨西哥暖流所孕育的、由棕榈树掩映的、旖旎幽静的田园风光而已。我们大多数人都满足于生存、繁衍，并为了生存和繁衍而奋斗，而拥有能够主宰我们命运的思想，为了掌控自身命运而命中注定要孜孜以求的只是其中幸运或不幸的极少数人。对我而言，阿蒂塔之所以让人产生兴趣，就在于她拥有与她的年轻貌美颇不相称的勇气。

“带我一起走吧。”一天深夜，他们懒洋洋地坐在月影斑驳的棕榈树下的草地上，她说道。黑人们已经把乐器拿到岛上，奇异的雷格泰姆音乐伴着那温暖的夜的气息轻轻飘荡。“十年后，我愿意以富甲天下的印度高等种姓的贵妇身份重现世间。”她继续说。

卡莱尔立即看了她一眼。

“你能做到，你知道的。”

她大笑起来。

“这算是求婚吗？很特别！阿蒂塔·法纳姆成为海盗的新娘。上流社会的姑娘被雷格泰姆乐队的银行抢劫犯绑架。”

“不是银行。”

“那是什么？为什么不告诉我呢？”

“我不想让你的幻想破灭。”

“我亲爱的人儿，我对你可没抱什么幻想。”

“我的意思是，你对自己的幻想。”

她吃惊地抬起头。

“我对自己的幻想！我到底与你们犯下的罪过有什么关系？”

“你就等着瞧吧。”

她伸出手拍了拍他的手。

“亲爱的柯蒂斯·卡莱尔先生，”她温柔地说，“你爱上我了吗？”

“这好像很重要。”

“但是，这的确很重要啊——因为我想我爱上你了。”

他嘲弄地看着她。

“这样的话，你一月份的总数恐怕要增至六个了，”他说道，“假如我给你亮出我的底牌，我想让你跟我一起去印度，你会怎么想？”

“我会去吗？”

他耸耸肩。

“我们可以在卡亚俄结婚。”

“你能给我什么样的生活？我并非不厚道，我只是认真而已；如果那些悬赏两万美元捉拿你的人真的抓住你了，我该怎么办？”

“我原以为你不怕的。”

“我从来都不怕——但是，我不能只为了向一个男人表明我不怕就自毁前程。”

“我希望你很穷，只是个可怜巴巴的小丫头，整天望着奶牛场温暖的篱笆想入非非。”

“难道这样不好吗？”

“我喜欢让你吃惊——喜欢看你睁大两眼盯着东西瞧的样子，要是你一心想要那些东西，该有多好啊。难道你不明白吗？”

“我知道——像那些两眼死盯着橱窗内的珠宝的女孩。”

“是的——并且想要那块大的、钻石镶边儿的、椭圆形的白金手表。只要你断定这块白金手表很贵，价值一百美元，我就会说，‘贵吗？我该说一点都不贵！’然后我们一起走进商店，让这块白金手表尽快在你的手腕上闪耀。”

“听起来很棒，虽然很庸俗——但是很有趣，不是吗？”阿蒂塔喃喃地说。

“不是吗？难道你没看见我们随心所欲地旅游，所到之处花钱如流水吗？难道你没看见那些门童和侍者崇拜的目光吗？哦，有钱真好啊，有了钱就能拥有整个世界！”

“我真心希望我们能过那样的日子。”

“我爱你，阿蒂塔。”他温柔地说。

顷刻间，她失去了孩童般天真的表情，一脸严肃。

“和我遇到的任何一个男人相比，”她说，“我更愿意和你在一起。我喜欢你的表情，喜欢你那有古典风格的黑发，喜欢你刚从岸上来到船栏边时的模样。事实上，柯蒂斯·卡莱尔，我喜欢你率性而为。我觉得你很有勇气，你知道我对勇气的看法。你在我身边的时候，我有时会被你吸引，会突然产生想要吻你的冲动，想对你说你就是那个脑子里装满印度种姓的胡言乱语的理想男孩。也许，如果我稍微大一点，稍微无聊一点的话，我就会跟你走。正因为如此，我想我会回去结婚——和另一个男人。”

在银光闪闪的水面上，黑人们的身影在月光下扭动摇摆，像久未练习、技艺生疏的杂技演员，一定要通过自己的把戏把多余的精力挥霍掉。他们列成一排向前走，再围成一个同心圆，一会儿把头往后仰，一会儿又抱着乐器弓着腰，像吹笛子的牧农神。长号和萨克斯管合奏出悠扬的乐曲，时而热闹欢腾，时而余音袅袅、如泣如诉，仿佛刚果腹地的死亡之舞。

“我们跳舞吧！”阿蒂塔大声说，“耳畔回响着这么动听的爵士乐，我无法安静地坐着了。”

他牵着她的手，把她领到一片开阔而坚硬的沙土地上，那里沐浴着美丽缥缈的月光。他们在这皎洁而朦胧的月光中如蝴蝶般翩翩起舞，令人心醉神迷的交响乐时而荡气回肠，时而热烈激昂，时而撼人心扉，时而哀婉断肠，阿蒂塔最后的一点现实感也消失了。她闭上眼睛，任凭自己迷失在如梦如幻、花香四溢的热带夏日中，任凭自己迷失在那邈远无际的灿烂苍穹里。她觉得，如果她睁开眼睛，就会发现自己置身于一个想象的国度里，和一个幽灵在共舞。

“这就是我所说的单独的、私密的舞蹈。”他轻声说道。

“我感觉我要发疯了——不过是高兴得发疯！”

“我们着魔了。不可计数的食人族的鬼魂在那边高高的悬崖上望着我们呢。”

“我敢说食人族的女人们正在风言风语地说我们跳舞时身体靠得太近，说我不戴鼻环不成体统呢。”

他们两人轻声地笑起来——然后他们的笑声消失了，他们听到远处水面上的长号声在半中间戛然而止，萨克斯受了惊吓似的吼了一声，然后也消失了。

“怎么回事？”卡莱尔喊道。

过了一会儿，他们看见有个模糊的黑影沿着海湾边跑。他跑近一些的时候，他们看出那个人影原来是贝比，他异常激动地来到他们面前，喘着气一股脑地道出了事情的原委。

“一艘轮船停在离岸大约半英里外的地方，先生。摩斯在放哨，他说看上去船已经抛锚了。”

“一艘轮船——什么样的轮船？”卡莱尔急切地问。

他的声音听起来很沮丧，阿蒂塔看到他的整个脸都耷拉了下来，她的心猛地揪了一下。

“他说他不知道，先生。”

“他们登上小船了吗？”

“没有，先生。”

“我们上去看看。”卡莱尔说。

他们无声地登上那个小山包，阿蒂塔的手仍然攥在卡莱尔的手心里，就像他们刚刚跳完舞时那样。她觉得这只手偶尔紧张地握一下，仿佛他没有意识到他们的手握在一起。然而，尽管他弄疼了她，她却没想把手抽出来。爬到山顶似乎需要一个小时的时间，要小心翼翼地穿过一片阴暗的高地才能到达悬崖边。卡莱尔匆忙地看了一眼，不由得轻声叫了起来。那是一艘税收船，船头和船尾都装有六英寸口径的炮。

“他们发现了！”他急促地吸了一口气，说道，“他们发现了！他们追踪到我们了。”

“你确定他们知道这条通道吗？他们可能只是一早起来，在旁边看一下小岛而已。他们在那个地方看不到悬崖中间的这个入口。”

“他们用望远镜可以看到。”他绝望地说。他看看腕表，“差不多两点钟了。天亮之前他们什么也不会做，这一点可以确定。当然，他们有可能在等着和其他船只会合；或者在等一艘运煤船，但是这种可能性很小。”

“我想我们不妨就待在这里。”

时间在流逝，他们肩并肩躺在那里，无声地用双手托着下巴，像睡梦中的孩子。在他们身后，蹲着那些黑人，他们耐心、顺从、悄无声息，时不时地传来响亮浑厚的鼾声，即使目前的危险处境也无法抵挡这些非洲人此刻对于睡眠的那种无法抑制的渴望。

就在五点钟前，贝比来到卡莱尔身旁，说“水仙花号”船上有六支步枪，是不是决定不抵抗了？

他想，即便他们能够制订出什么计划，也一定避免不了一场恶战。

卡莱尔笑着摇摇头。

“那不是一支西班牙军队，贝比。那是一艘税收船，它已做好战斗的准备，如箭在弦上，它随时都会用机枪向我们扫射。如果你愿意把这些袋子埋起来，以后再找机会找到它们的话，就去干吧。不过，这没什么用——他们会把小岛掘地三尺的。这场战斗毫无胜算，贝比。”

贝比垂着头，默默地离开了。卡莱尔转过身，声音沙哑地对阿蒂塔说：“他是我最好的朋友，他愿意为我而死，并为此感到荣幸，如果我允许他这么做的话。”

“你已经放弃了？”

“我别无选择。当然总是有办法的——胜券在握的办法——不过需要等待。只要有可能，我就不会错失良机——这将是一次有趣的、臭名昭著的尝试。‘法纳姆小姐公开声明，海盗对她的态度始终如绅士一般。’”

“别说了！”她说道，“非常非常抱歉。”

当天边的彩霞渐渐褪去，暗淡的蓝色天空变成铅灰色的时候，轮船的甲板上乱作一团，他们看清楚那是一群穿得像白鸭子一样的官员，聚集在栏杆旁，手里举着望远镜，聚精会神地搜索着这个小岛。

“全完了。”卡莱尔严肃地说。

“见鬼！”阿蒂塔悄声说。她感觉到泪水在眼里打转。

“我们回到游艇上去，”他说道，“我宁愿回到游艇上，也不愿乖乖地待在这里像负鼠一样被他们捉住。”

他们离开高地，下了山，来到海湾边，乘着沉默的黑人们划的小船回到游艇上。然后，他们面无血色，疲倦地坐到藤椅里等待着。

半个小时后，天已蒙蒙亮了，税收船的船头出现在那条通道上并停了下来，显然是担心水太浅。游艇看上去很平静，那个男人和那个姑娘坐在藤椅里，黑人们懒洋洋地靠着栏杆好奇地观望着。他们显然已经断定不会有什么反抗，因为有两艘船随意地停在游艇的舷边。一艘船上坐着一名官员和六名海军；另一艘船上有四名划船的人，船尾有两位身着游艇绒的白发老人。阿蒂塔和卡莱尔站起来，不由自主地向对方走去。然后他止住脚步，突然将一只手插进衣袋，掏出一个闪闪发光的圆环，伸手递给她。

“这是什么？”她吃惊地问道。

“我不能确定，但是里面有俄文题词，那是我答应给你的手镯。”

“从哪里——到底从哪里——”

“从一个袋子里挑出来的。你瞧，柯蒂斯·卡莱尔和他的六个黑人伙计，在棕榈树海滩酒店的茶餐厅演出的时候，突然把他们的乐器换成了自动手枪，打劫了一群人。我从一个漂亮的、浓妆艳抹的红头发女人手上抢到了这只镯子。”

阿蒂塔皱起了眉头，然后嫣然一笑。

“这么说来，这就是你的所作所为！你的确勇气可嘉！”

他鞠了一躬。

“资产阶级名扬四海的优秀品质。”他说。

然后，黎明的曙光生机勃勃地斜照在甲板上，将阴影抛到灰暗的角落里。露珠被蒸发成一层薄薄的金色水雾，如梦似幻。他们置身于这梦中，直到深夜渐渐隐退，剩下这虚无缥缈的一点痕迹和这无边无际的宁静。有那么一刻，大海和天空都屏住了呼吸，黎明从生命的青春之唇中伸出一只粉红色的小手——然后一艘划船从远处的海湾边缓缓地驶来，并传来唰唰的摇橹声。

东方的天边升起一座金光四射的火炉，两个高贵优雅的身影就在这万道光芒中融为一体，他亲吻着她那被娇宠惯了的、青春的小嘴。

“真是荣幸。”过了片刻，他喃喃地说道。

她对他嫣然一笑。

“很开心，是吗？”

她的叹息是一道恩赐——一个令人迷醉的明证：她正值青春，美丽动人，这一点她向来都了然于心。又有那么一刻，生命如此灿烂，时间如梦如幻，他们的信念海枯石烂都不会改变——然后传来了一道碰撞刮擦的声音，两艘划船并排擦着游艇的一侧停了下来。

两位白发老人走上舷梯，那位官员和两个水手手里拿着左轮手枪。法纳姆先生抱着双臂，站在那里看着他的侄女。

“那么……”他点着头缓缓地说。

她叹着气，把双臂从卡莱尔的脖子上松开，她的眼睛炯炯有神，漫不经心地看着船上的一群人。她的叔叔看着她慢慢地噘起上嘴唇，这自负傲慢的噘嘴动作，他最熟悉不过了。

“那么，”他粗鲁地重复着说，“那么，这就是你想要的——想要的爱情。私奔，和一个公海海盗私奔。”

阿蒂塔心不在焉地看了他一眼。

“你真是个老傻瓜！”她平静地说。

“你是不是只会说这句动人心弦的话？”

“不，”她若有所思地说，“不，还会说点别的。有句名言，这几年我常用它来结束我们之间的谈话，那就是——‘闭嘴’！”

说完，她转过身，向那两位老人、那位官员和那两位水手投去唐突轻慢的一瞥，高傲地走下舱梯。

然而，假如她能够多等一小会儿，就会听见她叔叔发出一种和他们平时见面时有天壤之别的声音，那是一种发自内心的开怀大笑，另一位老人也跟着他一道哈哈大笑起来。

那位老人迈着轻快的步子来到卡莱尔身边，卡莱尔一直讳莫如深地、饶有兴趣地在观察着这一切。

“那么，托比，”他慈祥地说，“你这个不可救药的、一根筋的、追求浪漫情调的花花公子，你觉得她是你心目中的女神吗？”

卡莱尔自信地笑了笑。

“哦——当然，”他说，“自从我第一次听说她那疯狂的经历，我就非常确定这一点了。这就是昨天晚上我让贝比发射火箭的原因。”

“很高兴你这么做。”莫尔兰德上校严肃地说。“我们一直紧紧跟随着你们，免得那六个奇怪的黑鬼制造出什么麻烦来。我们希望看到你们两个能够互相妥协折中，”他叹着气说道，“好了，这就叫作以毒攻毒。”

“你父亲和我一夜没合眼，抱着最好的愿望——或者也许是最坏的打算。天知道你竟是她喜欢的人，我的孩子。她快让我发疯了。你将那只俄国手镯送给她了吗？那可是我派侦探从一个叫咪咪的女人那里找到的。”

卡莱尔点点头。

“嘘！”他说，“她到甲板上来了。”

阿蒂塔已经爬到舱梯最上面，她不由自主地看了一眼卡莱尔的手腕，脸上掠过迷惑的神情。黑人们开始在船尾唱起歌来，凉风习习的水面上回荡着祥和的浅吟低唱，一切沐浴在黎明清新的空气中。

“阿蒂塔。”卡莱尔慌乱地说。

她款款地朝他走了一步。

“阿蒂塔，”他喘着气重复着她的名字，“我必须告诉你——事情的真相。这完全是一个计划，阿蒂塔。我的名字不叫卡莱尔，我叫莫尔兰德，托比·莫尔兰德。这个故事是编的，阿蒂塔，是用佛罗里达稀薄的空气编出来的。”

她看着他，迷惑，吃惊，将信将疑，脸上迅速掠过一阵愤怒的狂潮。三个男人屏住呼吸。老莫尔兰德朝她走了一步；法纳姆先生的嘴角向下吊着，嘴巴微微张开，极其紧张地等待着一场意料之中的大爆发。

然而阿蒂塔没有爆发。她突然变得容光焕发，带着微笑飞快地朝小莫尔兰德走去，望着他，灰色的眼睛里没有一丝愤怒。

“你愿意发誓吗？”她平静地说，“你愿意发誓这完全是你自己想出来的吗？”

“我发誓。”小莫尔兰德急切地说。

她低下头温柔地吻了他。

“多么丰富的想象力啊！”她温柔地说道，几乎是出于嫉妒，“在我以后的人生里，我希望你能用你独特的甜蜜方式向我撒谎。”

黑人们的歌声缓缓地飘了回来，她分不清是她以前听到的歌声，还是他们此刻的歌唱。

时间是小偷，

快乐而悲伤，

挂在树叶上，

随着它变黄——

“袋子里装的是什么？”她温柔地问。

“佛罗里达的泥土，”他答道，“我给你讲的那些话只有两件事是真的，这是其中之一。”

“也许我能猜出另一个。”她说，然后她踮起脚尖，用温柔的亲吻做了解释。

五一节


这个伟大的城市(1)经历了一场战争，旗开得胜的人们在街上搭起拱形的凯旋门，并撒上白色、红色、玫瑰色的鲜花，显得生机盎然。在整个漫长的春日里，凯旋的将士们在锣鼓喧天、管乐嘹亮的欢乐气氛中沿着主干道列队而行，商人和职员们把纠纷和利益弃于一旁，挤到窗户边，神情肃穆地将一张张苍白的面孔转向从街上经过的队伍。

这个伟大的城市从来没有如此繁荣昌盛过，因为战争的胜利，列车把丰裕的物资源源不断地运送过来。商人们拖家带口，从南部和西部蜂拥而至，他们要尝遍所有的美味佳肴，要亲历这目不暇接、精心准备的娱乐节目——还要为他们的女人购买来年御寒的皮草、金丝包、五颜六色的真丝拖鞋、银色和玫瑰色的绸缎以及金丝绒布料。

战胜方的文人墨客们欢天喜地、洋洋洒洒地为和平和即将来临的繁荣兴旺献上赞歌，越来越多的有钱人从各省赶来，他们都要品尝一杯令人激动的美酒。商人们的拖鞋和其他小商品卖得越来越快，他们发出强烈的吁求，要求供应更多小饰品和拖鞋，以便在易货交易中拿得出顾客们要求的货物来。其中有人甚至无可奈何地挥着双手大声喊：

“天哪！我再也没有拖鞋了！天哪！我再也没有小饰品了！上帝呀，帮帮我吧，我不知道该怎么办了！”

然而，没有人听他们大喊大叫，因为人们都在各自奔忙——士兵们每天都英姿飒爽、昂首阔步地从大街上走过，所有人都欣喜若狂，因为这些从战场上归来的小伙子们既纯洁又勇敢、牙齿健康、面颊红润；而这片国土上的年轻姑娘们都保存着童贞之身，容貌和身段都曼妙动人。

因此，这个伟大的城市里有许多传奇故事都发生在这个时期，而其中有几个故事——或者说有一个故事——就是我要给大家讲述的。





一


一九一九年五月一日上午九点钟，一个年轻人在咨询巴尔的摩酒店的前台，他想知道菲利浦·迪恩先生是否住在那里，如果是的话，他能否给迪恩先生的房间打个电话。咨询者身穿剪裁考究却很破旧的西装，身材矮小单薄，脸色黝黑却很英俊；他的睫毛特别长，眼睛下面有两个不健康的黑眼圈，眉毛和黑眼圈把两只眼睛框在中间，他像是一直在发低烧，面颊上闪着病态的红光，将黑眼圈衬托得尤为突出。

迪恩先生的确住在那里。年轻人被领到旁边的电话机旁。

电话很快就拨通了。一个睡意蒙眬的声音从里面的某个地方向他问好。

“迪恩先生吗？”他的声音非常热切，“我是戈登，菲尔(2)，戈登·斯特雷特。我在楼下。听说你在纽约，我预感到你会住在这里。”

那个睡意蒙眬的声音慢慢地热情起来。“哦，戈迪(3)，老同学，你好啊！非常高兴，简直是惊喜！看在上帝的分上，现在就上来吧！”

几分钟后，菲利普·迪恩穿着蓝色的真丝睡衣，打开了房门，两个年轻人虽然有点尴尬，但还是热情地向对方打了招呼。两个人差不多都二十四岁，都是战争前一年从耶鲁大学毕业的；不过他们的相同之处仅此而已。迪恩金发碧眼，满面红光，薄睡衣里的身体显得很健壮。这一切都表明，他身体很棒，生活惬意。他笑意频频，露出引人注目的大龅牙。

“我正准备去拜访你呢，”他热情地大声说，“我有两个礼拜的假。你先坐会儿，我去冲个澡，马上就来陪你。”

他消失在浴室里，客人则忐忑不安地瞪着黑眼睛在客房里左顾右盼。角落里放着一个英国产的大旅行包，几把椅子上胡乱地扔着一堆衣服：几件同色系的重磅真丝衬衫、几条非常抢眼的领带、几双柔软的羊毛袜。他盯着旅行包和真丝衬衫看了一会儿。

戈登站起来，拿起一件衬衫，仔细观察。这是一件黄底带浅蓝色条纹的重磅真丝衫——而且差不多有十几件。他不由自主地看看自己的衬衫袖口——袖口边已经破旧，起了毛，还脏兮兮、灰蒙蒙的。他放下那件真丝衬衫，把外套袖子拉下来，再把磨破的衬衫袖口卷起来，让外套袖子完全遮住衬衫袖口。然后，他走到镜子前，闷闷不乐、无精打采地看着自己。他的领带以前也光鲜亮丽，然而现在已经褪色了，还皱巴巴的——再无法掩饰衬衫领口处已经磨毛的纽扣眼了。他悻悻地想，就在三年前大学毕业那一年，他还当选为班级里的时尚达人呢。

迪恩一边从浴室里走出来，一边擦着身子。

“昨晚我见到你的一个老朋友了，”他说道，“在大厅里碰到她的，想不起她的名字了，这让我很尴尬。是毕业那年你带到纽黑文去的那个女孩。”

戈登吃了一惊。

“伊迪丝·布拉丁？你说的是她吗？”

“就是她。漂亮极了。她依然像布娃娃一样漂亮——你明白我的意思：好像你碰她一下，就把她给玷污了似的。”

他自鸣得意地审视着镜子里的那个光鲜形象，含蓄地微笑着，只露出一点牙齿。

“她至少有二十三岁了吧。”他接着说道。

“上个月才二十二岁。”戈登心不在焉地说道。

“什么？噢，上个月。嗯，我想她是来参加伽马普赛舞会的。你知道今天晚上我们要去戴尔莫尼科酒店参加耶鲁校友举办的伽马普赛舞会吗？你最好去，戈迪。一半纽黑文人都会去呢。我能为你弄到一张请柬。”

迪恩很不情愿地穿上干净的内衣，点了一支烟，坐在开着的窗户边，对着洒满房间的清晨的阳光仔细检查他的小腿肚和膝盖。

“坐吧，戈迪，”他说道，“给我讲讲你都做了什么，现在在做什么，把一切都告诉我。”

戈登令人意外地瘫倒在床上，一动不动地躺着，情绪非常低落。表情平静时，他会习惯性地微微张着嘴巴，然而此刻，他的嘴巴突然间变得不听使唤，显得楚楚可怜。

“怎么了？”迪恩赶忙问道。

“哦，上帝！”

“怎么了？”

“什么事都不顺心，”他苦不堪言地说，“我完全崩溃了，菲尔。我走投无路了。”

“啊？”

“我走投无路了。”他的声音在颤抖。

迪恩的蓝眼睛以审视的目光更加仔细地观察着他。

“你看起来的确是不对劲儿。”

“是呀，我把什么事都搞得一团糟。”他顿了顿，“我最好从头讲起——你会不会感到厌烦？”

“一点都不会，接着讲吧。”然而，迪恩的声音里含着迟疑。他这次来到东部本来是打算度假的——发现戈登·斯特雷特身处窘境，他感到有点恼火。

“接着讲吧，”他重复着说，然后又小声加了句，“快点讲完得了。”

“哦，”戈登声音颤抖着讲起来，“我二月份从法国回来，在我的家乡哈里斯堡待了一个月，然后来到纽约找工作。我找到了一份工作——在一家出口公司上班。昨天他们把我解雇了。”

“把你解雇了？”

“我正准备说这事呢，菲尔。我不想和你绕弯子。这种情况，除了你，我无人可求了。我直言不讳地告诉你，你不会介意的，对吗，菲尔？”

迪恩的表情有点僵硬。他拍膝盖的手变得有些马虎了，他隐隐约约地感到，他正在被人不公正地强加了什么责任；他甚至不确定是否要继续听下去。尽管戈登·斯特雷特遇到些小麻烦从来都不足为怪，然而他目前的困境却有些不同寻常，即使这激起了他的好奇心，他依然感到厌恶和难以应对。

“接着讲吧。”

“是个女孩。”

“嗯。”迪恩决定无论什么事情都不能破坏他这次旅行。如果戈登还是如此令人沮丧的话，那么，自己最好和他少见为妙。

“她叫朱沃尔·哈德森，”床上那个痛苦的声音继续说道，“我想，大约一年前，她还是个‘纯洁’的姑娘。她住在纽约——一个贫困的家庭。现在她的家人都死了，她和一个上了年纪的姑妈住在一起。你知道，大约就在我遇见她的时候，人们开始成群结队地从法国回到美国——我整天忙着接待那些刚刚回来的人，并和他们一起去参加派对。我见到谁都高兴，也希望每个人都喜欢见到我，麻烦就是这么惹来的，菲尔。”

“你应该清醒一点。”

“我知道，”戈登停了一下，然后又无精打采地讲下去，“我当时已经独立谋生，可是菲尔，你知道，我无法忍受贫穷。然后，那个可恶的女人就出现了。有一阵子，她有点爱上我了，尽管我从来都不打算爱她，可我总是能在某个地方碰见她。你能想象得到，我在出口公司干的是什么差事——当然，我一直都想画画；为杂志画插图；那能赚很多钱。”

“那你为什么不去画呢？如果你想交好运，就必须全力以赴。”迪恩冷冷地、故作深沉地说。

“我试过了，尝试画过一点，可是我的画很粗陋。我有天分，菲尔；我可以画——不过我只是不知道怎么画。我应该到美术学校去学习，可是我付不起学费。哎，大约一个礼拜前，事情终于变得无法收拾。正当我几乎身无分文的时候，这个女人开始来烦我。她想要钱；她扬言，如果拿不到钱，她就会找我的麻烦。”

“她会吗？”

“恐怕她会。这就是我丢掉工作的一个原因——她一直不厌其烦地给我的办公室打电话。她还有最后一招：给我所有的家人写信。哎，她吃定我了，我投降。我不得不给她弄些钱。”

他们尴尬地沉默了一会儿。戈登非常安静地躺着，双手在身旁紧紧地攥着。

“我走投无路了，”他接着说，他的声音颤抖着，“我快要疯了，菲尔。要不是得知你要来东部，我想我已经自杀了。希望你能借给我三百块钱。”

迪恩的双手一直在拍打他那裸露着的脚踝，现在突然停住了——两人之间原本神秘微妙的关系变得紧张和僵持起来。

过了一会儿，戈登继续说：

“我已经把我的家人榨干了，我不好意思再问他们要一分钱了。”

迪恩仍然一言不发。

“朱沃尔说她必须拿到两百块钱。”

“告诉她你没钱。”

“没错，听起来很容易，可是，她拿着几封我喝醉后写给她的信。不幸的是，她根本不是你想象的那种轻易改变主意的女孩。”

迪恩流露出厌恶的表情。

“我受不了那种女人。你应该离她们远点。”

“我知道。”戈登有气无力地承认道。

“你得务实点。如果没钱，就去工作，并且离女人们远点。”

“你是站着说话不腰疼，”戈登眯起眼睛说，“你有的是钱。”

“我根本没什么钱。我每花一分钱，都被家人管得死死的。正是因为我花钱的余地非常小，所以才不得不格外仔细，不能浪费。”

他拉起百叶窗，让更多阳光照进来。

“我绝不是什么道学先生，天知道。”他不慌不忙地接着说道，“我喜欢轻松快乐——度假的时候尤其如此，可是你——你的情况非常糟糕。我以前从来没有见过你这副模样。看起来你是崩溃了——精神上和经济上都崩溃了。”

“难道两者能分开吗？”

迪恩不耐烦地摇摇头。

“你身上常常有一种莫名其妙的气味，一股邪气。”

“是焦虑、贫穷和夜晚失眠的味道。”戈登抵触地说。

“我不知道。”

“哦，我承认我让你扫兴了，我心情不好嘛。可是，上帝呀，菲尔，只要休整一个礼拜，穿一套崭新的西装，兜里装点钞票，我就会——恢复如初。菲尔，我画起画来就会一挥而就，如有神助，你知道的。但是大部分时间，我都没钱买像样一点的绘画材料——我精疲力竭、心情沮丧、穷途末路的时候可是无法画画的。只要有点钞票，我就可以休息几个礼拜，然后重新再来。”

“我怎么知道你不会把这些钱花到别的女人身上？”

“为什么总是揭人短处呢？”

“我并不是要揭你的短，我不想看到你这副模样。”

“你会借给我这么多钱吗，菲尔？”

“我不能马上做决定。这么多钱，会给我造成极大的不便。”

“如果你不借给我钱，我就万劫不复了——我知道我是在苦苦哀求，都是我的错，可是——这么说改变不了什么。”

“你什么时候能还钱？”

这句话令人鼓舞。戈登想了想，也许最明智的做法就是实话实说。

“当然，我可以答应你下个月就还钱，不过——我最好说三个月以后再还，等画一出手，我就还。”

“我怎么知道你的画能卖出去？”

迪恩的语气再次生硬起来，向戈登传达出一丝令人心寒的怀疑。他可能借不到钱了吗？

“我本来以为你对我还是有点信心的。”

“的确如此——不过，看到你这个样子我就开始怀疑了。”

“你认为如果不是到了山穷水尽的地步，我会这样来求你吗？你觉得我喜欢这么做吗？”他打住话头，咬住嘴唇，他觉得他最好把燃烧起来的怒火咽下去。毕竟，他是来求人的。

“看来你很会处理事情嘛，”迪恩怒气冲冲地说，“你把我置于难堪的境地，如果不借给你钱，我就成了不讲同学情谊的人——哦，没错，你的确是这么干的。那么，让我来告诉你，对我来说，得到三百块钱绝非易事。我的收入并没有那么多，要是没有这笔钱，我的生活就难以为继。”

他从椅子上站起来，精心选好衣服，开始穿起来。戈登伸开两只胳膊，用手抓住床沿，努力克制住自己，以免哭出声来。他的头疼得像裂开了一般，只觉得天旋地转，他的嘴巴很干、很苦。他觉得他的血液在燃烧，在分解成无以计数的血球，就像从屋顶上缓缓流下的水滴一样。

迪恩一丝不苟地打好领带，刷好眉毛，一本正经地把牙齿上的一片烟草去掉。接着，他把香烟装到香烟盒里，然后小心地将空盒子抛到垃圾篓里，把香烟盒装进马甲口袋里。

“吃早饭了吗？”他问道。

“没有，不想吃了。”

“哦，一起出去吃点吧。钱的事以后再说吧。我讨厌这个话题。我来东部是想寻开心的。

“我们去耶鲁俱乐部吧。”他一脸不高兴地继续说。接着他又含蓄地责备道：“你已经把工作丢了，已经无事可做了。”

“要是有点钱，我就会有很多事情可做。”戈登坦率地说。

“哦，看在老天的分上，暂时撇开这个话题吧！把我的整个旅行都弄得一塌糊涂是没有道理的。这点钱给你，给你。”

迪恩从钱夹里掏出一张五块钞票，扔给戈登，戈登小心翼翼地把钞票叠好，装进衣袋。他的脸上又多了一点红色，一种并非由发烧所致的灼热感。就在转身出去的那一刻，他们的目光相遇了，就在那一刻，两个人同时意识到了某种东西，迅速垂下各自的目光。就在那一刻，他们非常突然、非常明确地将彼此怀恨在心。





二


中午，第五大街和第五十四大街上人山人海。开心又阔气的太阳将瞬息万变的金色光芒透过豪华商场的厚玻璃窗，照在里面的网格包、钱包、灰色天鹅绒包装盒里的串串珍珠上；照在五颜六色、花里胡哨的羽毛扇子上；照在豪华礼服的蕾丝花边儿和真丝布料上；照在室内装潢者精心设计的展览室内展出的劣质绘画和精致的古典家具上。

正值韶华的职业女性们三三两两、成群结队地在这些橱窗前流连忘返，从奢华的展品中挑选未来的闺房用品，展品中甚至还有一套摆在床上、富有家庭气息的男士真丝睡衣。她们站在珠宝店橱窗前，挑选订婚戒指、结婚戒指和白金手表，然后又随意逛着去细细查看羽毛扇子和晚礼服斗篷，顺便把午餐吃的三明治和圣代消化掉。

人群中总是混有穿军装的人，从驻扎在哈德森河上那庞大的舰队里来的水手，佩戴着从马萨诸塞到加利福尼亚师部番号的士兵，他们迫不及待地想引起人们的关注，却发现，除非他们英姿飒爽地排成漂亮的队形，背上那令人讨厌的行军包和步枪，否则这座伟大的城市已经厌弃他们了。

迪恩和戈登在这鱼龙混杂的人群中闲逛；迪恩兴致勃勃地感受人类展现出的浮华绚丽的一面，变得活泼起来；戈登却回想起过去他曾怎样频繁地在这样的人群中穿梭，疲惫不堪，三餐不定，超负荷工作，身体都被掏空了。对迪恩而言，奋斗是意义非凡的，是年轻人的专利，是令人振奋的；而对戈登而言，奋斗却是苦不堪言、毫无意义、无休无止的。

他们在耶鲁俱乐部遇到了一群以前的同班同学，大家吵吵嚷嚷地向远道而来的迪恩问好。他们坐在躺椅和大椅子上，围成半圆形，喝着四周摆满的、掺有冰水的威士忌饮料。

戈登觉得他们的谈话令人心烦、没完没了。他们一起吃了午饭，又打了鸡血似的喝了一下午的酒。他们都要去参加那天晚上的伽马普赛舞会——这场舞会将会是战后最热闹的派对。

“伊迪丝·布拉丁会来的，”有人对戈登说，“她以前不是你的老相好吗？你们两个不都是从哈里斯堡来的吗？”

“是的。”他试图转换话题，“我偶尔见到她哥哥。他是个坚定的社会主义者，好像在纽约经营了一家报纸什么的。”

“呃？这可不像他那位追求享乐的妹妹。”他那位热情的情报员接着说，“哦，她今晚和一个名叫彼得·希梅尔的三年级学弟一起来。”

戈登八点钟必须和朱沃尔·哈德森见面——他答应为她筹些钱。他心急如焚地看了几次手表。令他感到释然的是，四点钟的时候，迪恩站起来声称他要去里夫斯兄弟商店买几条领子和几条领带。然而，令戈登懊恼的是，这群人中还有一个人也跟着他们一起离开了俱乐部。此刻，迪恩的心情好极了，他愉快地期待着晚上的舞会赶快到来，简直有点喜出望外。到了里夫斯商店，他买了一打领带，每买一条，他都要和另外那个人讨论很久。他是否觉得窄领带又会重新流行起来？里夫斯商店不再出售韦尔奇·马吉特森领子是不是很遗憾？再也找不到像“科温顿”牌那样的领子了。

戈登感到心头有点发慌，他想马上拿到钱。此刻，他也隐隐约约地想去参加伽马普赛舞会，而且被这个想法鼓舞着。他渴望见到伊迪丝——伊迪丝，就在他去法国的前一天，他在哈里斯堡的乡村俱乐部和她度过了一个浪漫的夜晚后，就再也没有见过她。这场恋爱结束了，被战争的旋涡吞没了，而且这三个月以来他历经坎坷，已经完全把它弃于脑后了。然而，她的形象突然跳进他的脑海，激起他千百个回忆。她活泼、开朗，津津有味地说着闲话。正是伊迪丝的音容笑貌使他如获至宝，他怀着一种若即若离却又情深意长的爱慕之情度过了大学生活。他喜欢为她画像——他的房间里摆了十几幅她的素描画像——打高尔夫的，游泳的——他闭着眼睛都能画出她那娇俏玲珑、令人心醉的轮廓。

他们五点半离开了里夫斯商店，在人行道上站了一会儿。

“哦，”迪恩快活地说，“现在，我的东西都买齐了。我想我要回酒店刮刮胡子，理个发，做个按摩。”

“好极了，”另一个人说，“我想我和你一起吧。”

戈登想弄明白他是否被人耍了。他艰难地抑制住自己的情绪，让自己不要对那人咆哮，“滚开，你这个浑蛋！”戈登在绝望中产生了怀疑，也许，迪恩之前已经和他串通好了，让他一直跟着他们，以免为了钱的事发生争执。

他们走进巴尔的摩酒店——一家住满女孩子、充满生机的酒店——她们大都来自西部和南部，是许多大城市中初涉社交界的、灿如星河的名门闺秀。她们聚集在这里，是为了参加一所知名大学的一个知名的校友会举办的舞会。然而她们的音容笑貌在戈登看来却恍然如在梦中。他竭尽全力想做最后的请求，他正要开口说出连自己都不知所云的话，迪恩却突然向那个人表示出歉意，然后拽着戈登的胳膊把他拉到一边。

“戈迪，”他匆匆地说，“我已经对这件事情做了全面、仔细的考虑，我决定不能借给你那笔钱。我也想帮你，可是我觉得我不该那么做——这会给我的生活带来一个月的不方便。”

戈登呆呆地望着他，奇怪地想，为什么自己以前从来没有注意到他上面的那排龅牙凸得那么厉害。

“——非常抱歉，戈登，”迪恩接着说，“不过，情况本来就是这样。”

他掏出钱包，不紧不慢地数了七十五美元。

“这是，”他说着，伸出手，“这是七十五美元，总共八十美元。实际上我身上带的现金除了旅游的必要开支，也就只有这么多了。”

戈登不假思索地举起一只攥得紧紧的手，如打开握着的钳子般把手指伸开，接过钱，又重新攥起来。

“舞会上见，”迪恩接着说，“我得去理发店了。”

“再见。”戈登说，他的声音僵硬而沙哑。

“再见。”

迪恩开始微笑，不过似乎又突然改变了注意，匆匆地点点头，走开了。

戈登却站在那里，英俊的脸庞痛苦地扭曲着，手里紧紧攥着一卷钞票。接着，泪水突然模糊了他的双眼，他跌跌撞撞地从巴尔的摩酒店的楼梯上走下来。





三


当天晚上大约九点钟，有两个人从第六大街的一家廉价饭馆走出来。他们相貌丑陋，营养不良，除了愚蠢至极，其他一无所有，甚至连那种能给生活带来色彩的动物性生机都没有；不久前，他们还在一个陌生土地上的一个肮脏的城市里，浑身跳蚤，饥寒交迫；他们穷困潦倒，无亲无故；一生下来就像浮木一样随波逐流，居无定所，而且还将继续随波逐流到死亡的那一天。他们穿着美国军装，每个人的肩头都佩戴着一枚代表从新泽西州招募过来的师部徽章。三天前他们才来到这里。

两人中个子高的那个叫卡罗尔·基，这个名字表明，他的血管里流淌的血液具有某种潜在的禀赋，虽然这种禀赋经过代代相传已经差不多被稀释殆尽。然而，即使人们一直盯着他那没有下巴的长脸，盯着他那黯淡无神、泪水涟涟的眼睛和高颧骨看，也找不出一丁点祖传的可贵之处，更找不到一点天生的聪明才智。

他的同伴黑不溜秋的，罗圈腿，贼眉鼠眼，还长着残破的鹰钩鼻子。他那副目中无人的神气显然是装出来的，这种神气来自他以前一直生活在其中的那个充满咆哮和厮杀、好勇斗狠、崇尚武力的世界，是一种自我保护的武器。他的名字叫格斯·罗斯。

他们离开那家小饭馆，在第六大街上逛游，以完全超然的姿态兴致勃勃地用牙签剔着牙齿。

“去哪儿呢？”罗斯问道，他的语气表明，即使基说去南海群岛他也不会觉得奇怪。

“让我们看看能不能弄点酒喝，好吧？”禁酒还没有开始施行，他们说的是杜松子酒，按照法律规定，这种酒是禁止向士兵出售的一种烈酒。

罗斯兴致勃勃地同意了。

“我有办法了，”基想了一会儿接着说道，“我有个兄弟在这里。”

“在纽约吗？”

“是啊，他是个老小子。”基的意思是他是哥哥，“他在一家小饭店里当侍者。”

“没准他能帮我们弄点。”

“我觉得他能！”

“相信我，明天我就把这身该死的军装脱下来，再也不穿了。我要给自己弄身正常的衣服穿。”

“哎，我可能还没这个打算呢。”

他们的财富加在一块还不到五块钱，所以这个打算在很大程度上只能当作一个开心的玩笑，没有害处，还能聊以自慰。不过，他们两个似乎都因此而兴奋起来，他们嘿嘿地笑着，大声地谈论着《圣经》中的重要人物，画着十字，还插入“哇，天哪！”“你知道的！”“我觉得就是这样！”等用语，用来进一步加强语气，还一遍一遍地重复个没完，这更增添了他们的欢乐。

两个人全部的精神食粮均来自这些年来他们用鼻音愤愤不平地评论那个多年来让他们维系着生命的机构——那里是军队，是商业机构，也是贫民院——以及机构中他们的顶头上司。直到那天上午，机构变成了“政府”，顶头上司变成了“上尉”——他们从这两重束缚中溜了出来，现在他们感到有点不适应，除非他们愿意接受新的束缚。他们前途未卜，满怀愤懑，还有点惴惴不安。他们把这些情绪统统掩藏起来，对离开军队表现出一副故作轻松的姿态，并且相互保证，军队的纪律再也不能约束他们那热爱自由的坚定意志了。然而，事实上，他们待在囚牢里要比待在这新找到的、毋庸置疑的自由中自在得多。

基突然加快步子，罗斯抬起头顺着他的目光看去，发现一群人聚集在街上五十码远的地方。

基咯咯地笑起来，开始朝着人群的方向奔跑；罗斯也跟着咯咯笑起来，他那两条短罗圈腿在同伴那大步流星的、难看的大长腿旁快速移动着。

他们跑到人群的外围，立刻就成为其中毫无区别的一部分了。人群中有破衣烂衫的平民百姓，更糟的是他们还喝了酒，有从很多个师部来的士兵，他们的清醒程度各不相同，所有人都围在一个小个子犹太人周围。这个犹太人长着又长又黑的络腮胡子，挥着胳膊，正在情绪激昂、深入浅出地发表演讲。基和罗斯像木楔子似的将自己挤入后排，满腹狐疑地仔细审视着他，因为他的话戳中了他们两人共同的伤心事。

“——你们从战争中得到了什么？”他义愤填膺地大声说，“好好看看吧，好好看看吧！你们发家致富了吗？你们拿到事先承诺过的巨款了吗？——不，你们活着，能够保全两条腿就已经很幸运了。你们回来后，发现老婆没有和用钱把自己从战场上赎回来的家伙私奔就已经很幸运了！能那样你们就算是走运了！除了J. P.摩根和约翰·洛克菲勒，还有谁从战争中得到过什么好处？”

说到这里，那个矮个子犹太人的演讲被打断了，一个充满敌意的拳头狠狠地击中了他那胡子拉碴的下巴，他向后趔趄了一下，仰面朝天地倒在人行道上。

“该死的布尔什维克！”那个铁匠出身的大个子士兵骂道，他就是出拳的人。人们嚷嚷着表示赞同，人群围得更近了。

犹太人摇摇晃晃地站起来，立刻又招来五六个拳头，他再次倒下去。这次，他躺着不动了，呼哧呼哧地喘着粗气，血从嘴唇里面和外面的伤口处渗了出来。

人群喧嚣着，不一会儿，罗斯和基发现自己夹在这乱哄哄的人群中，在一个瘦子和一个士兵的带领下走在第六大街上。瘦子是一介平民，戴着一顶帽檐耷拉着的帽子；士兵肌肉发达，是他迅速结束了犹太人的演讲。人群急剧膨胀，阵势吓人，人行道上有越来越多不表明立场的群众也跟在后面，时不时地发出一声呼喊，为他们提供精神上的支持。

“我们要去哪儿？”基大声问离他最近的那个人。

他的邻居指了指戴帽子的那个领头人。

“那个人知道他们的窝点在哪儿！我们要去给他们点颜色看看！”

“我们要去给他们点颜色看看！”基兴奋地小声对罗斯说，罗斯又喜出望外地把这句话重复给他另一边的一个人。

队伍沿着第六大街狂奔，随处都有士兵和水兵加入进去，随时都有市民加入进去，那些市民一定会大声说，他们自己刚刚从军队里复员，仿佛这句话是一张刚刚成立的运动或文娱俱乐部的入场券。

接着，队伍在十字路口突然转到另一条街道上，并朝第五大街挺进，随处都有人透漏出消息，说他们要到托利弗大会堂去，那里在开红色会议。

“这个地方在哪儿？”

这个问题在队伍中传开，一会儿工夫，答案就传回来了。托利弗大会堂在第十大街上。还有一伙士兵准备去破坏现场，他们现在已经赶到了！

然而，第十大街听起来很远，消息一传出来，人群里叫苦连天，有二十个人中途退出队伍，这些人当中就有罗斯和基。他们放慢步子，慢悠悠地走着，让越来越多的狂热之徒从他们身边一涌而过。

“我宁愿弄点酒喝。”基说。他们停下脚步，开始朝人行道上走，耳边传来“胆小鬼”“逃兵”的怒骂声。

“你哥哥不是在这附近工作吗？”罗斯问道，表现出从肤浅状态升华到不朽状态的大彻大悟。

“应该是，”基回答道，“我有几年没见过他了。从那时起，我就外出去了宾夕法尼亚。他晚上可能不上班，这也说不准。反正就在这一带。要是他还在这儿，一定能给我们弄些酒的。”

他们在街上来来回回地逡巡了几分钟，终于找到那个地方——在第五大街和百老汇大街之间的一个铺着劣质桌布的饭店。基走进去打听哥哥乔治，罗斯则在人行道上等着。

“他已经不在这里了，”基出来的时候说道，“他现在发达了，到戴尔莫尼科酒店当侍者去了。”

罗斯英明地点点头，仿佛这早在他的意料之中。有能耐的人经常跳槽，人们不该感到奇怪。他曾经认识一名侍者——于是，他们一边走，一边就侍者的实际薪水是否比拿到的小费多这个问题进行了一次长谈——最后他们达成一致意见，即这要看哪个社会阶层的人在侍者工作的酒店出入。他们为彼此描绘出一幅栩栩如生的美妙图景：百万富翁们在戴尔莫尼科酒店进餐，喝下第一夸脱香槟后，便甩出一张五十块的钞票。接着，两个人都暗暗盘算着要去当侍者。事实上，基那狭窄的前额上隐藏着一种决心，他要让哥哥为他介绍一份工作。

“侍者可以把客人们酒瓶里剩下的酒全喝光，”罗斯饶有兴趣地说，接着又补充了句，“哦，天哪！”

他们走到戴尔莫尼科酒店的时候已经十点半了，他们吃惊地发现，川流不息的出租车一辆接着一辆地驶到酒店门口，从车上走下来一个个盛装打扮、不戴帽子的女士，每个女士都由一名身穿晚礼服、昂首阔步的年轻绅士陪着。

“这是在开派对哩，”罗斯敬畏地说，“也许我们不进去为好。他会很忙的。”

“不会的，他不会很忙。他应付得来。”

他们犹豫了一会儿，走进在他们看来似乎是最容易进去的那道门，马上又犹豫起来，惶恐不安地来到一个小餐厅里的一个无人注意的角落里。他们摘下帽子，拿在手里，心头掠过一团愁云。餐厅的一头有一扇门被砰然打开，他们两个都吓了一跳。一名彗星似的侍者冒了出来，快步穿过餐厅，从另一头的那扇门走出去，消失了。

这两个寻亲的人经历了三次如此这般的一惊一乍，才调动所有的聪明才智向一名侍者打了个招呼。侍者转过身，怀疑地看着他们，然后迈着轻缓的猫步走到他们身边，仿佛准备随时转身逃走似的。

“喂，”基说，“喂，你认识我哥哥吗？他是这里的一名侍者。”

“他叫基。”罗斯做出注解。

没错，这个侍者认识基。他想，基在楼上。那个大舞厅要举办一场大型舞会。他会告诉基的。

十分钟后，乔治·基来了，以最大程度的怀疑向他的弟弟打了个招呼；他的第一个也是最自然的想法是：弟弟是来向他要钱的。

乔治个子很高，几乎没有下巴，但是他们兄弟俩的相似之处也就这么多了。侍者的眼神不呆滞，非常机警，闪着亮光，他彬彬有礼，看上去一直在做室内工作，有点优越感。他们彼此客套地问候了一番。乔治已经结婚，有三个孩子。听说卡罗尔当兵时去过国外，他似乎很有兴趣，但没有表现出对卡罗尔的钦慕之情，这让卡罗尔感到失望。

“乔治，”弟弟撇开繁文缛节，说道，“我们想好好喝两杯，但是他们不卖给我们。你能给我们买点吗？”

乔治想了想。

“没问题。也许我能。不过，可能得等半个小时。”

“行，”卡罗尔同意了，“我们等着就是了。”

听到这里，罗斯开始往身旁的椅子上坐，但是乔治生气地大喝一声，他又赶紧站起来。

“喂！当心，你！不能坐在这儿！这个房间都准备好了，十二点钟这里有个宴会。”

“我不会把它弄脏的，”罗斯不满地说，“我喷过去虱剂了。”

“算了，”乔治厉声说道，“如果领班看到我在这儿说闲话，会对我发火的。”

“哦。”

对于这两个人，无须多解释什么，提到领班就够了；他们紧张地用手指捏着从国外带回来的帽子，等待吩咐。

“听我说，”乔治顿了顿，然后说道，“有个地方，你们可以在那儿等，快跟我来。”

他们跟在他后面，从餐厅另一头的那扇门走出去，穿过一个没有人的食品储藏室，上了两层黑漆漆的旋转楼梯，最后来到一个小房间里，里面堆着许多桶和清洁刷，开着一盏昏暗的电灯。他向他们要两元钱，答应他们半个小时后给他们带来一夸脱威士忌，然后把他们留在那个房间里，走开了。

“我敢打赌，乔治捞着大钱了，”基坐在一个倒扣的桶上，满面愁容地说，“我想他一个礼拜能挣五十美元。”

罗斯点点头，吐了口痰。

“我也这么认为。”

“关于这个舞会，他说什么了没有？”

“许多大学生，耶鲁大学的。”

他们严肃地朝对方点点头。

“不知道那群士兵现在走到哪儿了？”

“不知道。我只知道对我来说，那条路真他妈的太长了，永远也走不到头。”

“我也这么觉得。你没见过我走那么远的路吧。”

过了十分钟，他们闲得发慌。

“我想去看看外面有什么。”罗斯说着，小心翼翼地朝另一扇门走去。

这是一扇两面都可以推拉和开关的绿呢门。他小心翼翼地把门推开了一英寸。

“看到什么了吗？”

为了回答这个问题，罗斯猛吸一口气。

“妈的！我觉得这里有酒！”

“酒？”

基也来到门口，和罗斯一道劲头十足地向外看。

“我敢当着世界人民的面说那是酒。”他目不转睛地盯着看了一会儿，然后说道。

那个房间是他们待着的那个房间的两倍大——里面正准备举办豪华的酒宴。两张铺着洁白桌布的桌子上，摆着一排排墙似的、准备供贵宾们饮用的瓶装酒；威士忌、杜松子酒、白兰地、法国和意大利苦艾酒，还有橘汁，更不用说那一排苏打水瓶和两个巨大的、装潘趣酒的空碗。房间目前还没有人来。

“这是为马上要举行的舞会准备的，”基小声说道，“是不是小提琴的声音？哦，天哪，我是不会介意参加一场舞会的。”

他们轻轻关上门，交换了一个心照不宣的眼神。他们两个完全没有必要揣摩对方的心思。

“我想去拿几瓶。”罗斯当机立断地说。

“我也这么想。”

“你觉得我们会被人发现吗？”

基想了想。

“也许，我们最好等到他们开始喝起来再说。现在酒瓶都摆好了，他们知道有多少瓶酒。”

他们就这个观点争论了一会儿，罗斯全力赞成现在就去拿一瓶，趁没人，把它塞在外套里。然而，基主张谨慎从事，他担心会给他哥哥招惹麻烦。如果等到贵宾们打开一些酒瓶后再去拿一瓶来，大家会认为是一个大学生喝掉了。

正当他们争论不休的时候，乔治·基急匆匆地从房间里穿过，只对他俩咕哝了句什么，就消失在那扇绿呢门外了。过了片刻，他们听到几下“砰砰”地开瓶塞的声音，接着听到了冰块清脆的声音和液体飞溅的声音。乔治在调制潘趣酒。

两个士兵冲着对方开心地笑了笑。

“嚯，天哪！”罗斯轻声说道。

乔治又来了。

“伙计们，小点声，”他急匆匆地说道，“五分钟后我会把你们要的东西带过来。”

他从进来的那扇门出去了。

等他的脚步声在楼梯里渐渐消失，罗斯马上小心地看了看，刺溜一下钻进那个令人愉快的房间，回来的时候手里已经拿着一瓶酒了。

“哎，听我说，”他一边说，一边和他的搭档欢欢喜喜地坐下来，把这第一瓶酒倒进肚里，“等他来了，我们问问他，我们能不能待在这里喝他为我们买的酒——明白了吧。我们要告诉他，我们没有其他地方喝酒——明白了吧。这样的话，一旦那个房间没人了，我们就可以神不知鬼不觉地溜进去，拿一瓶塞到外套里。我们得多拿点，够我们喝上几天——明白了吗？”

“明白了，”罗斯自己热烈赞成道，“啊，天哪！如果我们愿意，我们随时都可以把它卖给士兵们，只要我们愿意。”

他们沉默了一会儿，愉快地思考着这个主意。接着，基伸手解开值日军官制服外套领口的扣子。

“这儿很热，是吗？”

罗斯热烈地同意了他的观点。

“热得像地狱似的。”





四


她走出更衣室，穿过为了体面起见特意设在更衣室和大厅之间的休息室时，依然怒气未消——她如此生气，倒不是因为事情本身，毕竟那只不过是社交场上的一件最为稀松平常之事，而是因为这件事发生在这个特殊的夜晚。她没有觉得自己失礼。她既保住了尊严，又表现出无法言喻的遗憾，这是她惯有的风格。她果断而巧妙地拒绝了他。

这件事发生在他们的出租车驶离巴尔的摩酒店的时候——还没走出半个街区那么远。他笨拙地抬起右臂——她坐在他的右边——试图用右臂紧紧拥住她披在身上的那件皮毛镶边的红色晚礼服斗篷。这本身就是个错误。对于年轻人而言，用离女士较远的手臂去拥抱一个并不确定是否会默许他这么做的年轻女士是比较得体的必要做法，这样可以避免抬起较近的手臂而造成的尴尬动作。

他的第二个错误是无意间造成的。她在美发店做了一个下午的头发；要是她的发型突然间遭到破坏，想想都令人不快——然而，彼得在做他那个不幸的尝试时，他的胳膊肘偏偏就轻轻地碰了那头发一下。这是他犯下的第二个错误。两个错误就已经足够了。

他开始低声抱怨。听到他的第一声抱怨，她就断定，他只不过是个上大学的小男生而已——伊迪丝二十二岁了，无论如何，战争爆发以来，举办这样的舞会还是第一次，这个舞会越来越让她浮想联翩，让她回想起其他事情——另一场舞会和另一个男人，这个男人让她在忧伤的眼神中恍恍惚惚地度过了青春期。伊迪丝·布拉丁陷入了她和戈登·斯特雷特往日的爱恋回忆中。

她这样思绪联翩地从戴尔莫尼科酒店的更衣室走出来，在门口站了会儿，从面前那个穿着黑西服的背影肩头望过去，看到了那群耶鲁大学生，他们像高贵华丽的黑色飞蛾一样从楼梯上一扫而过。楼道里，许多正值韶华的姑娘们来往穿梭，浑身散发着芳香，这浓郁的芳香从她刚刚离开的房间里一路飘来——这是馥郁的香水和容易脱落却沾满回忆的香粉的味道。芳香缭绕着，和大厅里浓烈的香烟味混合起来，愉快地飘到楼下，弥漫到伽马普赛舞会的舞厅里。这种味道，她很熟悉，是一种让人兴奋、激动、不安的甜蜜味道——是有钱人光顾的舞会的味道。

她想起自己的容貌。她用香粉把裸露的双臂和香肩涂得雪白滑润，她明白，她的双臂和香肩看起来富有弹性。今天晚上，在那些穿着黑色西装的背影中，她一定会被衬托得肤如凝脂，光芒四射。发型做得非常成功：微微泛红的发丝先被拢起，接着压平，然后再烫卷，直到做成冷艳绝俗的流动曲线。她那胭脂红的嘴唇优雅精致；她美目流盼，如瓷器般光洁生辉，虹膜碧蓝透亮，似乎一触即破。她如细柳扶风，娇柔俏丽，是十全十美的人间尤物，从繁复有致的秀发，到纤巧如莲的双足，都款款如水，楚楚动人。

她思考着在今晚这种隆重的场合该怎么讲话，此起彼伏的谈笑声、踏踏的脚步声、楼梯上上下下的情侣们已经把气氛烘托得颇有点不同寻常了。她会使用她已经使用了许多年的语言——这是她的拿手好戏——由当时的流行用语和几个新闻词汇以及大学生俚语组成，是一种浑然一体的、漫不经心的、带点挑逗性的、优雅而伤感的表达方式。听到坐在她旁边楼梯上的一个女孩说：“你什么都不懂，亲爱的！”她莞尔一笑。

她的怒气因为微笑而暂时消退了，她闭上眼睛，心情愉悦地深吸一口气。她将胳膊放到身体两侧，隐隐约约地触到了她那曲线优美、光滑时尚的紧身衣服。她从来没有像现在这样觉得自己是如此的娇柔可人，也从来没有像现在这样如此愉悦地欣赏着自己雪白的手臂。

“我身上散发着甜蜜的香味。”她不由自主地自言自语，接着，脑海里又冒出了一个念头，“我是为爱情而生的。”

她喜欢这句话，就又想了一遍；接着，戈登便出现在最近使她心烦意乱的梦中，萦绕不去。两个月前，她就在愁肠百结的想象中明白，她的心中有一个再明白不过的渴望：她想和他再见一面。而此时此刻，似乎正是这个渴望引领着她，让她选择在这个时候，来参加这个舞会。

尽管伊迪丝有着超凡脱俗的美貌，然而，她表情严肃，思想沉稳。和她哥哥一样，她也天生热爱思考，天生具有变成社会主义者与和平主义者的青春理想。亨利·布拉丁曾经是康奈尔大学的经济学老师，现在他离开了这所大学来到纽约，为一家激进的周报撰写专栏文章，要为无可挽救的社会弊病提供最新的整治良方。

伊迪丝可是一点都不蠢，她非常乐于救治戈登·斯特雷特。戈登天性软弱，她想为他诊治；他无能又无助，她想保护他。她想要一个相识已久且对她爱慕已久的人。她有点厌倦了；她想结婚了。凭着一堆情书、五六张照片、照片里隐藏的五六个回忆，加上她目前的厌倦情绪，她便决定，下次见到戈登，他们的关系就会发生变化。她会说点什么来促成这种变化。就看今天晚上了，今天晚上是属于她的，每天晚上都是属于她的。

接着，她的思绪被一个表情凝重的在校大学生打断了，他似乎受到了伤害，拘谨地来到她面前，向她深鞠一躬。这个人就是陪着她来的彼得·希梅尔。他个子很高，很滑稽，戴着一副角质框架眼镜，一副异想天开的样子。她突然非常讨厌他——可能是因为那个不成功的接吻。

“哦，”她说，“你还在生我的气吗？”

“我压根没生气。”

她走过去拉拉他的胳膊。

“很抱歉，”她轻声说，“我不知道我刚才为什么会以那样的方式突然躲开。今天晚上，我的心情很糟糕，原因很奇怪。对不起。”

“没关系，”他含糊地说，“不必放在心上。”

他觉得很别扭，很不开心。对于他刚才的这个失败之举，她要一直不厌其烦地啰唆下去吗？

“这是个误会，”她有意用同样的温柔口吻继续说，“我们俩都忘了它吧。”听到这句话，他开始恨她。

几分钟后，他们朝舞池滑过去。这时，十二个特地请来的爵士乐队的乐手摇摆着、叹息着，向拥挤的舞厅传递着消息，“要是不理会我和萨克斯，你们还成双成对的干吗！”

一个留着胡子的人插进来。

“嗨，”他嗔怪道，“不记得我了吧。”

“我只是想不起你的名字了，”她轻松地说，“可是，我清清楚楚地记得你呢。”

“我遇见你的时候，是在——”真是令人伤心，他的声音越来越小，最后干脆听不见了，因为一个满头金发的漂亮男生插了进来。伊迪丝礼节性地轻声对那个陌生人说：“非常感谢，这会儿有人——等会儿再来和我跳啊。”

金发男生执着而热烈地同她握手。她记得他叫吉姆，可她认识无数个吉姆——他姓什么，鬼才知道。她甚至记得他跳舞的节奏很奇怪，等他们跳起来的时候，她发现的确如此。

“准备在这儿待很久吗？”他亲密地小声说。

她向后收了下身体，仰起头看着他。

“两个礼拜。”

“你住在哪里？”

“巴尔的摩酒店。有空给我打电话。”

“一定，”他向她保证，“我一定会打。到时候我们一起去喝茶。”

“一定——去喝茶。”

一个皮肤黝黑的人十分讲究礼节地插了进来。

“不记得我了，是吗？”他郑重其事地问道。

“我觉得我记得你。你叫哈伦。”

“不对，是巴洛。”

“哦，我知道，反正你的名字是两个音节。你在霍华德·马歇尔家举办的聚会上演奏过尤克里里，很精彩。”

“我演奏过——不过不是——”

一个龅牙男插了进来。伊迪丝闻见一股淡淡的威士忌味道。她喜欢男人们喝点酒；这样他们就会更加兴奋，更加乐于评价和善于恭维——交谈起来就会更容易。

“我叫迪恩，菲利普·迪恩，”他愉快地说，“你不记得我了，我知道，不过，你过去常和戈登·斯特雷特到纽黑文来，我们俩大四那年同住一个房间。”

伊迪丝赶忙抬头看了看。

“是的，我和他一起去过两次——去参加软鞋和便鞋舞会，以及大学三年级舞会。”

“你一定看见他了吧，”迪恩不经意地说，“他今晚也来了，我刚才还看见他了。”

伊迪丝吃了一惊。可是，她明明已经预感到他会来的。

“哦，不，我还没有——”

一个红头发的胖子插了进来。

“嗨，伊迪丝。”他说道。

“哦——嗨，是你呀——”

她跳错了一步，被轻轻地绊了一下。

“对不起，亲爱的。”她机械地小声说。

她刚才是看到戈登了——戈登脸色苍白，沮丧地靠在门框上，一边吸烟，一边朝舞厅里看。伊迪丝看得出来，他的脸消瘦了——他那只夹着烟放在嘴边的手在颤抖。他们现在快跳到他身边了。

“——他们请来这么多讨厌、多余的家伙，你——”这个小个子男人说。

“嗨，戈登。”伊迪丝隔着舞伴的肩膀叫道。她的心在狂跳。

他那黑色的大眼睛盯着她，朝她迈出了一步。她的舞伴松开手——她听到他在嘀嘀咕咕地发牢骚——

“——可是，没有舞伴的人大都是抽会儿烟，然后就离开了，因此——”接着，她的身边传来一个低沉的声音。

“请您跳支舞，好吗？”

她突然就和戈登跳起来了；他用一只胳膊搂着她；她感觉到他的胳膊时不时地收紧一下；感觉到她背上那只手的手指张开着。她那只拿着蕾丝手帕的手被他攥在手心里，快被捏碎了。

“哦，戈登。”她开始娇喘起来。

“嗨，伊迪丝。”

她又跳错了——为了恢复舞步的节奏，她被猛地向前拉了一下，她的脸碰到了他那黑色的晚礼服上。她爱他——她知道她爱他——接着是一阵沉默，她的心头突然袭来一种奇怪和不安的感觉。有什么地方不对劲儿。

当明白过来是怎么回事时，她的心突然揪了起来，翻江倒海的不是滋味。他一副可怜相，悲悲戚戚的，有点醉了，还疲惫不堪。

“哦——”她不由自主地叫了一声。

他低头看着她，她突然看到他的眼中布满血丝，眼珠不听使唤地转动着。

“戈登，”她轻声叫道，“我们坐会儿吧，我想坐会儿。”

他们几乎在舞池正中央，她看见两个人正从左右两个方向朝她走过来，因此，她收起舞步，抓住戈登无力的手，领着他磕磕碰碰地穿过人群。她的嘴巴紧紧地闭着，涂着香粉的脸有点苍白，眼里蓄满颤颤欲滴的泪水。

她在铺有柔软地毯的楼梯上找了一处比较高的地方，他一屁股坐到她身边。

“哦，”他的目光游移不定地看着她，说道，“很高兴见到你，伊迪丝。”

她看着他，没有作答。他的这副德行对她的打击是难以估量的。几年来，喝醉的人她见得多了，从父辈们一直到司机，她要么感到好玩，要么感到厌恶，而此时此刻，她第一次产生了一种新的感受——一种无法言喻的恐惧。

“戈登，”她责怪地说，几乎要哭出来了，“你看起来像个魔鬼。”

他点点头。“我遇到麻烦了，伊迪丝。”

“麻烦？”

“各种各样的麻烦。你不会告诉我的家人吧，我可是彻底崩溃了。我简直是一团糟，伊迪丝。”

他的下嘴唇耷拉着——几乎不看她。

“你能不能——你能不能，”她犹豫着说，“你能不能给我讲讲是怎么回事，戈登？你知道我一直都很喜欢你。”

她咬着嘴唇——她本来打算把话说得狠一点，但是最终发现她说不出口。

戈登呆滞地摇摇头。“我不能对你说，你是个好女人。我不能对好女人说这种事。”

“废话，”她反感地说，“我想，你以这种态度无论称谁是好女人，都是对她彻头彻尾的侮辱，是在抽人的脸。你一直都在喝酒吧，戈登。”

“谢谢。”他严肃地垂下头，“谢谢你给我说这些。”

“你为什么喝酒？”

“因为我太痛苦。”

“你觉得喝酒能减轻痛苦吗？”

“你在做什么——想改变我吗？”

“不，我想帮你，戈登。能不能给我讲讲是怎么回事？”

“我的处境糟透了。你最好装作不认识我。”

“为什么，戈登？”

“我为插进来和你跳舞表示道歉——这对你不公平。你是个纯洁的女人——反正是那种好女人。好了，我这就另外找人和你跳舞。”

他笨拙地站起来，但她伸手把他拉下来，坐在她身旁的楼梯上。

“好了，戈登。你简直荒唐。你在伤害我。你的言谈举止简直像——像个疯子——”

“我承认。我有点疯了。我出问题了，伊迪丝。有些东西一去不复返了，这没什么关系。”

“有关系，告诉我吧。”

“是这样的。我一直都古里古怪的——和别的男孩子有点儿不一样。上大学的时候一切都正常，但是现在什么都不对了。四个月了，一直有什么东西像挂衣服的钩子一样在撕扯我的心，要是再有几个钩子，我就彻底完了。我正在慢慢地发疯。”

他把全部的目光都集中到她的身上，并开始大笑起来，她畏缩了，离他远了点。

“到底是怎么了？”

“这就是我，”他重复着说，“我要发疯了。对我来说，这里的一切都像一场梦——这家戴尔莫尼科酒店——”

他的话让她明白，他已经完全变了，他一点也不阳光，不快乐，不无忧无虑了——他完全是一副半死不活、失魂落魄的样子。她感到一阵恶心，继而感到一阵轻微的、令人吃惊的厌烦。他的声音似乎来自浩瀚的太空。

“伊迪丝，”他说，“我过去常常觉得自己很聪明，很有天赋，是个艺术家。现在，我知道我什么都不是。我不能画画了，伊迪丝。我不知道为什么要告诉你这些。”

她茫然地点点头。

“我不能画画，无所事事，穷得像教堂里的老鼠。”他痛苦地狂笑起来，“我变成了一个该死的乞丐，一个吸朋友血的蚂蟥。我是个失败者，穷得像鬼一样。”

她的厌恶之情增加了，这一次，她连头都懒得点了，准备随时找个借口抽身离去。

突然，戈登的眼睛里满是泪水。

“伊迪丝，”他看着她说，他显然在极力控制自己的情绪，“我无法告诉你，知道还有人喜欢我对我意味着什么。”

他伸出手拍拍她的手，她不由自主地将手缩了回去。

“你真是太好了。”他反反复复地说。

“哦，”她看着他的眼睛缓缓地说，“任何人见到老朋友都会很高兴的——但是，看到你这样，我很遗憾，戈登。”

他们对视着，沉默着，他眼中那短暂的热情游弋不定。她站起来，面无表情地看着他。

“我们去跳舞吧？”她冷漠地说。

爱情是易碎的——她想——不过，碎片也许能保存下来，它是逗留在唇间的亲吻，也可能是动听的情话。新的情话和准备好的温柔，就好好珍藏起来，留给下一位情人吧。

护送可爱的伊迪丝来参加舞会的彼得·希梅尔非常不习惯被拒绝；而被人拒绝后，他便觉得很受伤，很尴尬，觉得羞辱难当。两个月以来，他和伊迪丝·布拉丁一直都通过特快专递的方式保持着友好关系，他知道通特快专递的信件的一个借口和解释就是此举具有交流情感的价值。他曾经对自己信心十足，认为自己的地位牢不可破。然而她却对一个简单的接吻采取了那样的态度，他苦苦地思索着每一个可能的原因，却都是白费力气。

因此，当被一个留着胡子的男人插进来取而代之的时候，他便走出舞厅，来到前厅里，想了一句话，自言自语地重复了好几遍，经过大刀阔斧地删减，变成下面的定稿：

“哦，如果一个女孩引诱一个男人，然后又让他受到沉重的打击，她就是这么干的——那么，如果我出去美美地喝上几杯，她也绝对不会来烦我。”

因此，他穿过餐厅，走进与餐厅相连的一个小房间，那天晚上早些时候他就待在那里。房间里有几大碗潘趣酒，旁边摆着很多酒瓶。他就在摆着酒瓶的桌子旁坐下来。

喝完第二杯掺有冰水的威士忌，什么无聊、厌烦、时间的单调乏味、事件的剪不断理还乱，统统陷入模糊的背景里，渐渐远去。他的思绪变成一张闪闪发光的蛛网，这里的一切都已经自行达成妥协，悄无声息地睡去了；一天的麻烦也已经自觉地排成井然有序的队伍，按照他要立即把它们驱除出脑海的愿望，一齐退场，消失不见了。烦恼遁形后，他便进入精彩迷人的象征性的想象里。伊迪丝是个水性杨花、无足轻重的女孩，不值得为她牵肠挂肚；他宁愿对她嗤之以鼻。她是一个存在于他梦中的人物，与他周围那个肤浅的世界融为一体，而他自己却是一个可以触摸的具体符号，是凡间的酒神，是游戏人生的出色的追梦人。

接着，象征性意识渐渐消失，喝完第三杯威士忌，他的想象变成一团灼热的红光，他陷入迷离状态，仿佛仰面躺在水上，快乐地随波逐流。就在这时，他注意到身边的绿呢门被推开了大约两英寸，一双眼睛隔着门缝正紧紧地盯着他。

“呃。”彼得平静地咕哝了一声。

绿呢门关上了——接着又打开了——这次只打开了半英寸。

“躲猫猫呢。”彼得含含糊糊地说。

门不动了。接着，他意识到有人在断断续续地悄声说话。

“一个人。”

“他在做什么？”

“坐那儿傻看哩。”

“他最好滚蛋，我们还得再拿一小瓶。”

彼得仔细听着，这些话缓缓地渗入他的意识。

“哦，这，”他想，“这真是再好不过了。”

他非常兴奋，简直欢欣鼓舞。他觉得碰到了一桩奇事。他站起来，装作若无其事的样子，绕着桌子转圈——接着，突然转身，拉开绿呢门，害得江洋大盗罗斯猛地栽进房间。

彼得鞠了一躬。

“你好！”他说。

江洋大盗罗斯一脚在前，一脚在后，前脚轻轻点地，摆出随时准备战斗、逃跑或者妥协的姿势。

“你好！”彼得客气地又问候了一声。

“我很好。”

“能请您喝杯酒吗？”

江洋大盗罗斯打量着他，怀疑他可能是在讽刺自己。

“当然。”他终于说。

彼得指着一把椅子示意他坐下。

“坐下吧。”

“我有个朋友，”罗斯说，“我有个朋友在那里。”他指了指绿呢门。

“我们一定要让他进来。”

彼得走过去，打开门，热情地把满腹狐疑、惶惶不安、充满罪恶感的江洋大盗基叫了进来。他们三人各自找了把椅子，围着巨大的潘趣酒碗坐下来。彼得给他们每人倒了一杯威士忌，又从烟盒里抽出两根香烟递给他们。他们两人心虚地接受了。

“现在，”彼得轻松地接着说，“我是否可以问问两位绅士，你们为什么宁愿待在一间据我目测里面装满清洁刷的房间里来打发时光呢？当人类已经进化到除礼拜日外的每一天都能生产出一万七千把椅子的时候——”他顿了顿。罗斯和基茫然地望着他。“你们能否告诉我，”彼得接着说，“你们为什么宁愿坐在本来是用来把水从一个地方送到另一个地方的工具上？”

这时，罗斯哼唧了一声算是做了回答。

“最后，”彼得总结性地说，“你们能否告诉我，你们走进一幢挂着枝形灯架的漂亮大楼，却为什么宁愿待在一盏毫无生气的电灯下面打发良宵？”

罗斯看看基，基看看罗斯。他们笑起来，放声大笑起来；他们发现，他们这样面对面看着对方，不发出笑声是不可能的。不过，他们并不是和这个人一起笑的——他们在嘲笑他。对他们而言，一个人以这种方式说话，要么已经酩酊大醉，要么就是个癫狂病人。

“你们是耶鲁大学的，我想。”彼得说，他喝光了杯子里的威士忌，准备再喝一杯。

他们又笑起来。

“不是的。”

“哦？我本来想说，也许你们是耶鲁大学的二级学院谢菲尔德科技学院的。”

“不是的。”

“哎，那么，这就不好玩了。你们肯定是哈佛大学的，隐姓埋名，急着来到这个——这个蓝紫色的天堂，就像报上所说的。”

“不是的，”基嘲弄地说，“我们只是在等人。”

“啊，”彼得吃惊地说，他站起来，为他们斟上酒，“有意思。和某个清洁女工有约会，呃？”

他们两人愤怒地予以否认。

“这没什么，”彼得打消他们的顾虑，“不用觉得丢脸。清洁女工和世上任何一个女子一样好。吉卜林说：‘任何一个女子的心灵都能和朱迪·欧格雷迪相媲美。’”

“没错。”基说着，下流地朝罗斯递了个眼神。

“就拿我的情况来说吧，”彼得喝完一杯酒，接着说，“我带了个女孩过来，她娇惯成性，在我见过的女孩当中，她是被宠得最不像样的该死的一个。她拒绝和我接吻；没有任何理由。她故意引诱我，让我觉得很想吻她，然后，扑通一声！把我甩了！年轻一代到底会变成什么样子？”

“哎，真不幸，”基说，“真是太不幸了。”

“哦，天哪！”罗斯说。

“再来一杯？”彼得说。

“刚才我们准备去打架，”基沉默了一会儿说，“可是，路太远了。”

“打架？——和那种人！”彼得说着，他摇摇晃晃地坐下来，“把他们全打趴下！我也当过兵。”

“是和一个思想激进的家伙打架。”

“就是那种人！”彼得热情地大叫，“我说的就是他们！宰了他们！消灭他们！”

“我们是美国人。”罗斯说，这句话暗示他们是顽强、勇敢的爱国者。

“当然，”彼得说，“世界上最伟大的民族！我们都是美国人！再干一杯。”

他们又干了一杯。

一点钟，一个特别的乐队来到戴尔莫尼科酒店，尽管这一天请来了很多特别的乐队，它也依然很特别。乐手们骄傲地围着钢琴坐着，承担起为伽马普赛兄弟会奏乐的责任。他们由一位赫赫有名的长笛演奏家带队。这位长笛演奏家有一手绝活：他吹长笛的时候，用头倒立着，一边用肩膀表演希米舞，一边吹出最近流行的爵士乐。他的表演因此在纽约同行中出类拔萃。他表演的时候，其他灯全部关掉，只有一盏聚光灯照着这位长笛演奏家，还有一束摇曳的灯光打着闪烁跳动的光影，变换着万花筒般丰富的色彩，照着跳舞的人们。

伊迪丝跳舞时有个习惯，她会一直跳到精疲力竭，进入如梦似幻的境界，这个境界只有初涉社交界的名媛们才能达到，就好比一个尊贵的人喝完几杯威士忌后脸上泛起红光的那种状态。她的思绪随着心中的音乐幽幽地流淌；在色彩变换、摇曳不定的幽暗中，她的舞伴仿佛幻影般不断变换。她恍恍惚惚地觉得，从舞会开始到现在，仿佛已经过去好几天了。她和很多人谈了很多无关紧要的话题。有一个人吻她，有六个人向她求爱。这天晚上早些时候，不同的大学在校生和她跳过舞，但是现在，她和舞会上所有比较受欢迎的女孩一样，拥有自己的追随者——也就是说，有五六个风流倜傥的青年才俊选中她，或者，在她和其他被选中的美人之间周旋。他们每隔一会儿就必然会插进来和她跳舞，形成无限的循环。

有几次她看到了戈登——他久久地坐在楼梯上，用手捂着头，两眼呆滞地盯着前面地面上无数个小黑点，看上去非常消沉，而且醉醺醺的——然而，伊迪丝每次都急忙移开目光。一切都似乎是很久以前的事了；现在，她的大脑已经不会思考，感觉已经被催眠，恍然如梦；只有她的脚在跳着，她的声音在半梦半醒中说着煽情的玩笑话。

然而，当彼得·希梅尔一摇一晃、快快活活、醉态十足地插进来和伊迪丝跳舞时，她还不至于疲倦到无法表达理所当然的愤怒。她倒抽一口气，抬头看着他。

“喂，彼得！”

“我有点醉了，伊迪丝。”

“喂，彼得，你是个好人，你可真的是个好人！你不觉得这个时候来和我跳舞——是很不愉快的吗？”

接着她勉强地笑了笑，因为他一脸伤感，严肃地看着她，接着又痉挛般地傻笑起来。

“亲爱的伊迪丝，”他热情地说，“我爱你，你知道的，是吗？”

“你说得很清楚。”

“我爱你——而且，我只想让你吻我一下。”他伤心地补充道。

他的尴尬和羞耻心都消失了。她是世界上最漂亮的女孩，她长着最漂亮的眼睛，像天上的星星。他想道歉——第一，是因为他要吻她；第二，是因为他喝醉了——不过，他之前还那么沮丧，因为他以为她会对他大发雷霆——

一个红头发的胖男人插进来，他抬头看着伊迪丝，满面红光地微笑着。

“你带舞伴了吗？”她问道。

没有。这个红头发的胖男人没带舞伴。

“哦，你是否介意——如果今晚麻烦您送我回去——是不是很不方便？”（这种极度的羞怯实际上是伊迪丝故意释放出的甜蜜信号——她知道，这个红头发的胖男人会立刻融化在这突如其来的幸福中。）

“不方便？哦，我的上帝，我非常非常乐意效劳！您知道的，我非常非常乐意效劳。”

“万分感谢！您真是太贴心了！”

她看看手表，一点半了。而且，当她自言自语地说着“一点半了”的时候，模模糊糊地想起，吃午饭时哥哥曾经对她说过，他每天晚上都在报社的办公室里工作到一点半以后。

伊迪丝突然将目光转向面前的舞伴。

“戴尔莫尼科酒店到底在哪条大街上？”

“大街？哦，哦，当然是在，第五大街。”

“我的意思是，它在哪个十字街口？”

“哦——让我想想——是第五大街和第五十四大街的交叉口。”

这证实了她的想法。亨利的办公室一定在第五十四大街的对面，而且就在街角。她突然觉得，她可以溜出去一会儿，给他来个惊喜。一个光彩熠熠的仙女身披崭新的红色晚礼服斗篷，翩然而至，他一定会“喜出望外”。这正是伊迪丝乐此不疲的事情——不合传统却快乐无比的事情。这个想法跑出来，抓住她的想象——她犹豫片刻，便下定了决心。

“我的头发几乎全部要散下来了，”她愉快地对舞伴说，“我去整理一下，你不介意吧？”

“一点也不介意。”

“您真好！”

几分钟后，她披着红色的晚礼服斗篷从侧门的楼梯上轻快地飞奔下来，她的双颊因为这小小的冒险而闪着兴奋的光芒。她从站在门口的两个人身边跑过去——一个没有下巴的侍者和一个浓妆艳抹的年轻女子，他们在激烈地争吵——她打开外面的大门，步入五一节温暖的夜色里。





七


那个浓妆艳抹的年轻女子用仇恨的目光迅速扫了一眼她的背影——然后又看着那个没有下巴的侍者，继续争吵。

“你最好上去，告诉他我在这里，”她威胁着说，“否则，我就亲自上去。”

“不，你不能上去！”乔治厉声说道。

女子轻蔑地笑起来。

“啊，我不能上去，我不能上去吗？好吧，我告诉你吧，我认识的大学生比你一辈子见到的都多，他们都认识我，而且很愿意带我去参加舞会。”

“也许如此——”

“也许如此，”她打断他的话，“哦，她们随便哪个人，就像刚才跑出去的那个，都可以进去——天知道她跑哪儿了——他们受到邀请，可以随心所欲地进进出出——可是，我只是想见一个朋友，他们就派来一个给人送火腿和面包圈的寒碜的侍者，站在这里，把我挡在门外。”

“你瞧，”基的哥哥生气地说，“我不能丢掉工作，你说的这个人可能不想见你。”

“哦，放心吧，他想见我。”

“就算是这样，那么多人，我怎么去找他？”

“哦，他一定在那儿，”她信心满满地宣称，“你只要随便找个人问问戈登·斯特雷特在哪儿，他们就会帮你指出来。他们那些人都互相认识。”

她拿出网格袋，掏出一块钱递给乔治。

“给你，”她说，“贿赂贿赂你。你去找他，把我的话捎给他。告诉他，如果五分钟之内他不来见我，我就上去找他。”

乔治悲观地摇摇头，关于这个问题他又想了一会儿，依然摇摆不定，然后还是走开了。

还不到最后通牒的时间，戈登就下楼来了。他比那天晚上早些时候醉得更厉害，像是换了个人。酒精似乎在他身上装了一层盔甲，把他变得僵硬笨拙。他步履沉重，一摇三晃——几乎语不连贯。

“嗨，朱沃尔，”他舌头僵硬地说，“我没有耽搁就来了。朱沃尔，我没有借到钱，我尽力了。”

“根本不是钱的事！”她抢过话头，“我都有十天没见到你了，怎么回事啊？”

他动作迟缓地摇摇头。

“情绪低落，朱沃尔，一直病着。”

“如果你病了，为什么不告诉我。我没那么在乎钱。是你不在乎我，我才开始找你的麻烦。”

他又摇摇头。

“没有不在乎你。根本没有。”

“没有！你都三个礼拜没到我这儿了，除非你一直都醉得根本不知道自己在做什么。”

“一直病着，朱沃尔。”他重复着刚才的话，疲惫地将眼光转向她。

“你好得很呢，你能来这里，还能和你那些社交场上的朋友玩得很快活。你对我说，你会约我一起吃晚饭，说你会给我钱。可你甚至不愿费心打个电话。”

“我一点钱都没借到。”

“我刚才不是说过没钱没关系吗？我想见你，戈登，可是，你似乎更喜欢去见你的别的什么人。”

他极为反感地否认了这个说法。

“那么拿上帽子，一起走吧。”她提议。

戈登犹豫不决——她突然凑上去，抱住他的脖子。

“跟我一起走吧，戈登，”她几乎是在对着他的耳朵说话，“我们去迪万纳利斯酒店喝一杯，然后我们可以到我的公寓去。”

“我不能去，朱沃尔——”

“你可以去。”她热情地说。

“我病得像狗一样！”

“那么，好吧，你不该待在这里跳舞了。”

戈登朝周围看了看，他如释重负又伤心绝望，依然犹豫不决。于是，她猛地将他拉入怀中，用柔软湿润的嘴唇亲吻他。

“好吧，”他沉闷地说，“我去拿帽子。”

当伊迪丝从舞厅出来，走进五一节澄澈的蓝色夜空下时，她发现这条街上已经没人了。大商店的橱窗都黑漆漆的；门外拉上了巨大的铁制防盗门，在午夜的星辉下仿佛阴森森的坟墓。她顺着第四十二大街的方向看了一眼，看到通宵营业的饭店亮着朦胧的灯光。在第六大街的高架轨道上，一列火车发出刺目的光，从火车站出发，在发着微光的两排互相平行的路灯间，呼啸着穿过街道，风驰电掣般地消失在清新的黑夜中。但是，第四十四大街上却静悄悄的。

伊迪丝拉紧斗篷裹住身体，在这条街上奔跑。一个孤独的男人从她身边经过，用沙哑的声音悄声问道：“宝贝儿，去哪儿？”她吓了一跳。她想起小时候的一个夜晚，她穿着睡衣在街区周围逛着玩儿，一只狗从一个神秘大院的后院里蹿出来朝她汪汪乱叫。

不一会儿她就到了目的地，四十四大街上的一幢比较破旧的两层小楼。谢天谢地，她看到楼上的窗户里有一缕微弱的灯光，照在外面的光线足以让她辨认出挂在窗户旁的招牌——“纽约号角”。她走进黑漆漆的过道，过了一会儿，看到了角落里的楼梯。

然后，她走进一个狭长、低矮的房间，里面有很多桌子，每面墙上都挂着存档的报纸。里面只有两个人，分别坐在房间的两头，都戴着绿色眼罩，在孤独的台灯下写作。

她犹豫不决地在门口站了会儿，然后，两个男人不约而同地转过身，她认出了哥哥。

“喂，伊迪丝！”他马上站起来，吃惊地走到她身边，摘掉眼罩。他又瘦又高，皮肤黝黑，厚厚的眼镜下面一双黑色的眼睛十分敏锐。他眼神恍惚，好像总是越过和他说话的人看着远方似的。

他拉着她的胳膊，亲吻她的面颊。

“怎么了？”他有些担心地重复着这句话。

“我在对面的戴尔莫尼科酒店跳舞，亨利，”她兴奋地说，“我很想你，就情不自禁地跑来了。”

“你来这儿，我很高兴。”他不再担心，马上恢复到他惯有的恍惚状态，“不过，你不应该深更半夜独自出门，知道吗？”

房间另一头的那个人一直好奇地看着他们，但是，看到亨利示意他过来的手势，他就走过来。他很胖，肌肉松弛，两只小眼睛闪着亮光。他已经把领子和领带都取了下来，给人的印象仿佛是礼拜日下午中西部的一个农夫。

“这是我妹妹，”亨利说，“她来看我。”

“你好！”胖男人笑着说，“我是巴塞罗缪，布拉丁小姐。我知道，你哥哥早把我的名字忘记了。”

伊迪丝客气地笑了笑。

“哦，”他接着说，“我们这里不怎么豪华，是吗？”

伊迪丝环顾了一下房间。

“看上去很不错，”她回答说，“你们把炸弹放在哪里？”

“炸弹？”巴塞罗缪笑着重复说，“妙哉，妙哉——炸弹。你听见她说的话了吗，亨利？她想知道我们把炸弹放在哪里。嗯，妙哉，妙哉。”

伊迪丝一屁股坐到一张空桌子上，两只脚在桌边晃荡着。她哥哥坐在她的旁边。

“哦，”他心不在焉地问道，“你这次的纽约之行怎么样？”

“不错呀。我还要和俏皮鬼们一起待在巴尔的摩酒店，一直到礼拜日。你明天能来吃午饭吗？”

他想了一会儿。

“我很忙，”他拒绝道，“我不喜欢被围在女人堆里。”

“好了，”她平静地同意了，“就我和你一起吃午饭吧。”

“很好。”

“十二点我来叫你。”

巴塞罗缪显然急于回到他的书桌旁，然而他显然认为，如果不做个愉快的告别，是很不礼貌的。

“哦。”他窘迫地说。

他们两人都扭过头看着他。

“哦，我们——我们今天晚上早些时候度过了一段激动人心的时光。”

两个男人交换了个眼神。

“你应该早点儿来，”巴塞罗缪继续说，他有点受到了鼓舞，“我们这儿可有定期表演的杂耍节目。”

“真的吗？”

“是一首小夜曲，”亨利说，“许多士兵围在街上，朝着这块招牌叫嚷。”

“为什么？”她问道。

“只是一群人而已，”亨利心不在焉地说，“人们聚到一起总会吵吵嚷嚷。他们没有人主动挑头闹事，否则的话，他们可能会硬闯进来搞破坏。”

“是呀。”巴塞罗缪附和着说。他又转身对伊迪丝说：“你当时应该在这儿。”

他似乎认为，说完这句话就足以使他全身而退了，因为他突然转身，回到他的桌子边去了。

“所有士兵都反对社会主义者吗？”伊迪丝问哥哥，“我的意思是，他们会猛烈攻击你们吗？或者会发生类似的情况吗？”

亨利戴上眼罩，打了个哈欠。

“人类已经走过了漫漫长路，”他漫不经心地说，“但是大多数人都在大踏步地后退；士兵们不知道他们想要什么。或者说，他们不知道恨什么，爱什么。他们常常集体行动，似乎一定要去示威游行。他们反对我们只是临时起意。今天晚上到处都有骚乱。今天是五一节，你明白吧。”

“这场骚乱很严重吗？”

“一点都不，”他轻蔑地说，“大概九点钟的时候，他们大概有二十五个人站在街上，对着月亮大喊大叫。”

“哦——”她转变了话题，“见到我你高兴吗，亨利？”

“哦，当然。”

“你看起来像是不高兴。”

“我高兴着呢。”

“我想，在你的心目中，我是——虚度光阴的人，是那种世界上最糟糕的花蝴蝶。”

亨利笑起来。

“才不是呢。趁年轻，好好玩吧。你为什么这么说呢？我看上去是那种自命清高、一本正经的青年吗？”

“不——”她停顿了一下，“只是，不管怎样，我参加的那个舞会——和你们的目标——有着天壤之别。似乎有点——有点不和谐，是吗？——我跳舞，你却在这儿为了某种事业而工作，如果你的理想能够实现，那种舞会就会不复存在了。”

“我可不那么认为。你还年轻，你从小接受的教育就是要你这么做的。继续玩吧——好好享受快乐时光。”

她那一直悠然摆动的双脚停了下来，她压低嗓门说：

“我希望你——回到哈里斯堡，快快乐乐地过日子。你确定你走的是正路吗——”

“你的长筒袜真漂亮，”他打断她的话，“它们到底是怎么做成的？”

“是刺绣绣出来的，”她朝下看看，回答道，“是不是很精美？”她撩起裙摆，露出了被真丝长筒袜裹住的纤细的小腿肚，“或者，你不喜欢真丝袜？”

他看上去有点生气，黑色的眼睛敏锐地盯着她。

“你是想证明我无论如何都会责怪你的，是吧，伊迪丝？”

“根本不是——”

她打住话头不说了。巴塞罗缪咕哝了一声。她扭过头，看见他离开桌子，站在窗户边。

“怎么了？”亨利问道。

“人。”巴塞罗缪说道。过了片刻，他又说道：“到处都是人。他们正从第六大街赶过来。”

“人？”

胖男人使劲把鼻子贴在窗玻璃上。

“是士兵，上帝！”他加重语气叫道，“我就知道他们会杀个回马枪的。”

伊迪丝跳起来，也跑到巴塞罗缪身旁，站在窗户边。

“他们人好多！”她激动地大叫起来，“快来看，亨利！”

亨利调整了一下眼罩，却依然坐在那里。

“我们是不是最好把灯关掉？”巴塞罗缪提议道。

“不用。他们马上就会离开的。”

“他们不会离开的，”伊迪丝看着窗户外面说，“他们压根没想过要离开。来的人越来越多了。看——整整一大群人正转过第六大街的拐角，朝这边涌过来了。”

通过昏黄的街灯和灯光投射过来的蓝色人影，她能够看见人行道上挤满了人，大多数人都穿着军装，一些清醒，一些酩酊大醉，人群上空飘荡着时断时续的喧嚣声和叫嚷声。

亨利站起来，走到窗户边，办公室的灯光立刻映照出他那修长的身影。叫喊声立刻变为持续不断的呐喊，密密麻麻的小东西如香烟嘴、香烟盒，甚至硬币等砰砰嚓嚓地一齐投到窗户上。现在，折叠门已经被打开了，叫嚷声已经传到楼梯顶了。

“他们上来了！”巴塞罗缪大叫道。

伊迪丝心急如焚地扭头看着亨利。

“他们上来了，亨利。”

他们的喊叫声在楼下低矮的过道里清晰可闻。

“——该死的家伙！”

“亲德分子！为德国鬼子帮腔的坏蛋！”

“二楼，往上走！快点！”

“我们要抓住那些孙子——”

接下来的五分钟像是一场噩梦。伊迪丝意识到，喧哗声像一阵雨似的突然浇到他们三个人的头上，楼梯上传来雷霆般的脚步声。亨利抓住她的胳膊，把她拉到办公室的后面。接着，门开了，人们蜂拥而至，冲进房间——他们不是领头的人，只是碰巧走在前面的那些人。

“喂，德国佬！”

“来不及逃跑了，对吗？”

“你，还有你的情妇，该死的，你们！”

她看见两个醉汉被人推到最前面，他们愚蠢地摇摇晃晃——其中一个又矮又黑；另一个是高个子，没有下巴。

亨利向前走了一步，扬起手。

“朋友们！”他说。

喧嚣声暂时平静下来，时不时有人小声咕哝几声。

“朋友们！”他又喊了一遍，他那恍惚的眼神越过人们的头顶，看着远方，“今晚，你们闯到这里，只会伤害到你们自己。我们看上去像富人吗？我们看上去像德国人吗？总之，请你们公平——”

“闭嘴！”

“我说，你安静点！”

“说，谁是你的女朋友，伙计？”

一个身穿便装的人一直在翻桌子，他突然举起一张报纸。

“找到了！”他大声叫道，“他们希望德国人打胜仗。”

又一拨人从楼梯上涌过来，他们冲进屋子，突然之间，房间里挤满了人，他们都紧紧地围着屋子后边脸色苍白的几个人。伊迪丝看见那个没有下巴的高个子士兵依然在最前面，那个又矮又黑的士兵已经看不见了。

她稍微向后挤了挤，站在开着的窗户边，黑夜的风将一股凉爽清新的空气从窗口吹进来。

接着，屋子里骚动起来。她发现士兵们潮水般地向前涌，她瞥见那个胖男人把椅子举到头顶挥舞着——灯突然灭了，她能感觉到粗布衣服里面的温暖身体在推挤着她，她的耳朵里充满了叫喊声、践踏声和呼吸声。

一个不知从哪冒出来的人影从她身边一闪，被踉踉跄跄地挤到一边，突然无助地摔出窗口，不见了。他那惊恐万状、断断续续的惨叫声渐渐淹没在人们的喧嚣声中。借着后面那幢大楼微弱的灯光，伊迪丝立即判断出，那个人就是那个没有下巴的高个子士兵。

她的内心突然燃起一团怒火，她拼命地挥着胳膊，盲目地向人数最多、打成一片的那群人挤过去。她听到抱怨声、咒骂声和打在人身上的拳头声。

“亨利！”她疯狂地叫道，“亨利！”

接着，几分钟后，她突然感到屋子里还有几个人。她听到一个声音，一个深沉、霸道、权威的声音；她看到黄色的光束在吵闹的人群中乱照一通。叫声越来越疏落，扭打越来越剧烈，然后停息了。

灯突然亮了，屋子里全是警察，他们用警棍左右出击。那个深沉的声音大吼道：

“警察！警察！警察！”

接着又吼道：

“安静，出去！警察！”

屋子空荡荡的，像洗脸盆一样。一名站在角落里的警察紧紧抓住和他对着干的士兵，然后将他松开，朝门口猛推一把，把他吓跑了。深沉的声音还在吼。现在，伊迪丝看到，这个声音是一名长着公牛一样的脖子、站在门口的警长发出的。

“警察！不要胡闹了！一个士兵，是你们自己人，已经被人从后窗户里推出去，摔死了！”

“亨利！”伊迪丝大声叫着，“亨利！”

她疯狂地用拳头打前面那个人的后背；又从两个人中间挤过去；她打着、叫着，艰难地往前冲，桌子边的地板上坐着一个脸色苍白的人，她终于冲到他的身边。

“亨利，”她怒气冲冲地大声叫道，“你怎么了？你怎么了？他们把你打伤了吗？”

他闭着眼，呻吟着，然后抬起头，一脸厌恶地说：

“他们把我的腿打断了。天哪，这些蠢货！”

“警察！”警长大声叫道，“警察！警察！”





九


无论哪一天上午八点钟，“蔡尔兹，五十九大街”都与其他连锁店不同，大理石桌没有那么宽，炒锅也没有那么亮。你可以看到一群睡眼蒙眬的穷人，两眼直勾勾地望着面前的食物，以便可以不去看别的穷人。但是，四个小时前，五十九大街上的蔡尔兹饭店和其他任何一家蔡尔兹连锁店——从俄勒冈的波特兰，到缅因州的波特兰——都不相同。在它那墙壁洁净的餐厅里，你能看到闹哄哄的一群人：合唱团的姑娘、大学生、初涉社交界的名媛、浪荡公子、风尘女子——由百老汇大街甚至是第五大街上最快乐的人们组成的、有代表性的一个混合体。

五月二日清晨，客人爆满。姑娘们围着大理石桌面的餐桌，低着头，一脸兴奋。她们的父亲各自独拥一处庄园。她们津津有味地吃着荞麦面包和炒蛋。四个小时后，她们绝对不可能在这同一个地方再这么大吃一顿了。

几乎所有人都是参加完戴尔莫尼科酒店的伽马普赛舞会来到这里的，只有几个合唱团的姑娘是例外，她们刚刚演完一场讽喻时事的午夜滑稽剧，坐在靠边的餐桌旁，后悔表演完后没有将脸上的脂粉洗掉点。偶尔有几个灰头土脸、贼眉鼠眼的人，与整个画面极不协调，他们疲倦、疑惑、好奇地注视着这些花枝招展的姑娘们。然而，这些灰头土脸的人也是例外。这是五月二日的清晨，空气里五一节的节日气氛犹存。

格斯·罗斯虽然还算清醒，但也有点晕晕乎乎，他必须被划到灰头土脸之人的行列。骚乱结束后，他一直都稀里糊涂的，几乎不知道自己是如何从四十四大街来到五十九大街的。他看见卡罗尔·基的尸体被抬上救护车带走了，然后，他就和两三个士兵离开了闹市。在四十四大街和五十九大街之间的某个地方，其他士兵遇见了一些女人，然后就消失了。罗斯游荡到哥伦布转盘广场，选择了这家灯光闪烁的蔡尔兹饭店，这里有他热衷的咖啡和炸面圈，他要解解馋。他走进饭店，坐下来。

他的周围飘荡着无关紧要的高谈阔论和肆无忌惮的欢声笑语。起初，他无法理解是怎么回事，困惑了五分钟后，方才意识到这是欢乐舞会的余温。一个坐不住的、乐不可支的年轻人友好而亲切地穿梭于餐桌之间，见人就握手，时不时地停下来，贫上几句嘴。激动的侍者们高高地擎着蛋糕和鸡蛋，心中暗暗地诅咒着他，把他从通道上推开。对于坐在最不起眼、人数最少的餐桌旁的罗斯而言，这整个场面就是一场多彩多姿的巡演，关于美和狂欢的巡演。

过了一会儿，他渐渐意识到，坐在他斜对面的一对情侣，背对着人群，是这个餐厅里最无趣的一对。男的喝醉了，他穿着晚礼服，领带和衬衫都皱巴巴的，衣服上满是酒水。他的眼睛呆滞，布满血丝，眼珠机械地左右滚动着，嘴巴急促地喘着气。

“这个人怎么醉成这个样子。”罗斯心想。

女的不算完全清醒，也可以说几乎是清醒的。她很漂亮，黑眼睛，面颊绯红，她那双灵动的眼睛盯着她的伴侣，像鹰一样警觉。她时不时地倾着身子，热切地对他说着悄悄话，而他偏着沉重的头，或者特别像食尸鬼似的、令人厌恶地挤一下眼，算是对她的回应。

罗斯木然地仔细瞧了他们一会儿，直到那个女的唰的一下丢给他一个厌恶的眼神，他才作罢；接着，他把注视的目光转向两个最扬扬得意、最滑稽的人身上，他们不厌其烦地在餐桌间周旋。令他吃惊的是，他认出了其中一个年轻人，他曾经在戴尔莫尼科酒店接受过这个年轻人非常荒唐的款待。这使他开始想念起基来，还带着那么点伤感，其中也不能说没有掺杂着敬意。基死了，他从三十五英尺高的地方摔下去，脑浆迸裂，像烂椰子一样。

“他是个真正的好人，”罗斯伤心地想，“他是个真正的好人，没错。他太不幸了。”

那两个来回穿梭的人走过来，在罗斯的餐桌和旁边的餐桌之间坐下来，和颜悦色地和朋友以及陌生人亲切交谈。罗斯突然看到那个黄头发的龅牙男停下脚步，眼光迷离地看着对面的那对男女，然后开始不以为然地摇起头来。

眼睛布满血丝的那个男人抬头看了看。

“戈登，”那个来回穿梭的龅牙男叫道，“戈登。”

“嗨。”那个满身酒污的男人说道。

龅牙男悲观地朝这对情侣晃晃手指，朝那个女人投去一个高高在上、不屑一顾的眼神。

“要我怎么说你呢，戈登？”

戈登在座位上动了动。

“见鬼去吧！”他说。

迪恩继续站在那里摇着手指。那个女人开始发飙了。

“你，滚开！”她恶狠狠地说，“你喝醉了，你就是个醉鬼！”

“他也喝醉了。”迪恩说，依旧摇着手指，指着戈登。

彼得·希梅尔缓缓地站起来，现在，他面容严肃地准备发表演讲。

“啊，”他说道，好像是要处理孩子们鸡毛蒜皮的争吵一样，“这是怎么回事啊？”

“把你的朋友带走，”朱沃尔泼辣地说，“他在打扰我们。”

“到底是怎么回事啊？”

“你听到我说的话了吗！”她用刺耳的声音说道，“我说，把你那烂醉的朋友弄走。”

她那尖锐的声音响彻整个饭店，把所有的喧闹都压了下去。一名侍者赶忙走过来。

“你们得小点声！”

“那个家伙喝醉了，”她大声叫道，“他在侮辱我们。”

“啊——哈，戈登，”那个受到指责的人继续说道，“要我怎么说你好呢。”他转身对着侍者说：“我和戈登是朋友，我正在想办法帮他。是这样吗，戈登？”

戈登抬头看看。

“帮我？见鬼，根本不是！”

朱沃尔突然站起来，拉住戈登的胳膊，帮他站起来。

“来，戈登！”她说道，她贴近他，几乎是在耳语，“我们走吧，这个家伙喝醉了，在胡言乱语。”

戈登顺从地赶忙站起来，开始往门口走。有那么一刻，朱沃尔扭过头，对使他们不得不离开的肇事者说：

“我知道，这都是拜你所赐！”她凶神恶煞地说，“好朋友，是吧，呸！他可给我讲过你是个什么玩意儿。”

然后，她搀着戈登的胳膊，一起穿过好奇的人群，结了账，出去了。

“你得坐下。”他们走后，侍者对彼得说。

“什么？坐下！”

“是的——否则就出去。”

彼得扭着头看着迪恩。

“来，”他说道，“我们把这个侍者揍扁。”

“好。”

他们绷着脸，朝侍者走过去。侍者向后退着。

彼得突然把手伸到旁边桌子上的一个盘子里，抓起一把肉末抛向空中。肉末像雪花一样，悠然地画着抛物线，落在附近的人们头上。

“喂！老实点！”

“把他赶出去！”

“坐下，彼得！”

“把这些东西弄下来！”

彼得一边大笑，一边鞠躬。

“女士们，先生们，谢谢大家热烈的掌声。如果谁能再给我点肉末和一顶大礼帽，我就继续玩下去。”

门卫立刻赶过来。

“出去！”他对彼得说。

“见鬼，我不出去！”

“他是我朋友！”迪恩愤怒地插话。

一群侍者都聚拢过来。“把他轰出去！”

“最好出去吧，彼得。”

经过短暂的冲突，这两个人被推到门口。

“我的帽子和外套还在里面呢！”彼得叫道。

“好，去拿吧，快点！”

门卫放开彼得，彼得做出一副极其狰狞的荒唐面目，突然朝另一张桌子冲过去，轻蔑地放声大笑，对愤怒的侍者们表示出极度的不屑一顾。

“我想我最好再待一会儿。”他宣布道。

追逐游戏开始了。四个侍者被派遣过来切断一边的退路，另外四个侍者被派遣过来切断另一边的退路。迪恩抓住两个侍者的外套，又一场战斗打响了，追逐彼得的游戏开始了；在打翻一只糖罐和几杯咖啡后，他终于被扭住双臂。接着，在结账处发生了一场新的争吵，彼得想再买一盘肉末带走，准备扔到警察身上。

然而，他离开饭店的隆重仪式所引起的混乱与另一番景象比起来，简直是小巫见大巫。饭店里的每个人对那个景象纷纷投来钦慕的眼光，不由自主地拖着长音发出“啊——啊——啊！”的赞叹声。

饭店前面，一块巨大的厚玻璃变成了深邃的奶油蓝，马克斯菲尔德·帕里什画中的月光蓝——这种蓝色投射到窗玻璃上，似乎还要一股脑地倾泻到饭店里。魔术般令人吃惊的黎明降临到哥伦布转盘广场上，克里斯托弗那永垂不朽的伟大雕像的轮廓已清晰可见。黎明以其神秘、怪异的方式与饭店内微弱的黄色灯光浑然一体。

进先生和出先生的名字没有被户口调查员登记在户口簿上。要是想通过社交名人录或是出生登记、婚姻登记、死亡登记或杂货店老板的客户信誉表来调查他们的信息，一定是白费功夫。他们被人遗忘，证明他们活在世上的材料都模糊不清，无法确认，法庭无法认定。而我能够以最权威的证据证明，进先生和出先生曾经短暂地生活过，呼吸过，回应过他们的名字，而且因为鲜明生动的人格魅力而闪耀着光芒。

在他们的有生之年，他们穿着自己国家的服装走在一个伟大民族的一条伟大的公路上，被人耻笑、辱骂、追逐、厌弃。然后，他们就失踪了，再也听不到关于他们的消息了。

当一辆敞篷出租车在五月黎明的微光中轻轻驶过百老汇大街的时候，他们蒙蒙眬眬地有了意识。车上坐着进先生和出先生的灵魂，他们吃惊地议论着蓝色的光这么快就涂满了克里斯托弗·哥伦布雕像后面的天空，疑惑地议论着早起的人们那沧桑、灰暗的脸庞，他们苍白无力地沿着街道轻轻移动，仿佛纸片飘飞在黯淡的湖上。无论什么事情，从蔡尔兹饭店里那个门卫的荒唐行径到人生事业的荒诞不经，他们都能一拍即合。晨光惊醒了他们发烫的灵魂，他们被这脆弱的幸福弄得晕头转向。的确，生活中的快乐是那么新奇，那么生机勃勃，因此他们觉得应该大喊大叫地表达出来。

“耶——噢——噢！”彼得用手当扩音器，扯着嗓子大叫——迪恩也跟着大叫，尽管他的叫声非常含糊，却也同样不同凡响且具有象征意义。

“哟——嗨！耶！哟嗨！哟——嘣啪！”

五十三大街上有一辆大巴，上面坐着一位肤色黝黑的短发美人；五十二大街上有个清洁工，他身子一闪躲开了，同时气恼、痛心地大叫一声：“瞧瞧你们这是要往哪儿奔呢！”第五十大街上，一幢雪白的大楼前雪白的人行道上，有一群男人扭过头来在他们的身后大声喊：

“搭个伴吧，小伙子们！”

在四十九大街上，彼得扭头看着迪恩，眯着严肃的眼睛，一本正经地说：“美丽的早晨。”

“也许如此。”

“哎，吃早餐去吧？”

迪恩同意了——并做了补充。

“早餐和酒。”

“早餐和酒。”彼得重复了一遍，他们看着对方，点点头。“有道理。”

然后，他们俩爆发出一阵狂笑。

“早餐和酒！哦，天哪！”

“早餐没有酒。”彼得大声宣布。

“他们不卖？不要紧，我们强迫他们卖，我们给他们施加压力。”

“我们给他们讲道理。”

出租车迅速驶离百老汇大街，沿着和百老汇大街交叉的一条街道行驶，然后在第五大街上的一个巨型坟墓般的建筑物前停了下来。

“什么意思？”

出租车司机告诉他们，这是戴尔莫尼科酒店。

他们有点疑惑不解，不得不花几分钟时间把注意力集中起来进行思考，因为如果他们下达了这样的命令，就必定是事出有因。

“有人把外套落这儿了。”出租车司机说道。

是这么回事，彼得的外套和帽子，他把它们遗失在戴尔莫尼科酒店了。他们发现事情的原委后，就从出租车上下来，挽着胳膊向酒店门口走去。

“喂！”出租车司机喊道。

“啊哈？”

“你们最好把钱付给我。”

他们摇摇头，生气地予以否定。

“等会儿再说，现在不行——我们命令你等着。”

出租车司机不干，他想马上拿到钱。两个人怀着屈尊的不屑神气，费了九牛二虎之力控制住自己的情绪，把钱付给了出租车司机。

彼得徒劳地在酒店里面黑咕隆咚、空无一人的衣物寄存处摸索着，寻找他的外套和圆顶礼帽。

“丢了，我想，被人偷走了。”

“是谢菲尔德学院的学生。”

“绝对有可能。”

“没关系，”迪恩慷慨地说，“我把我的也扔到这儿——这样，我们俩就穿得一模一样了。”

他脱掉外套和帽子，要把它们挂起来的时候，钉在两扇衣帽间门上的两大块硬纸板引起了他的注意，牢牢地吸引了他那飘忽不定的目光。左边门上用黑体大字写着“进”，右边门上同样写着醒目的大字“出”。

“快看！”他开心地大叫。

彼得的目光顺着他手指的方向看过去。

“什么？”

“快看那两块牌子。我们把它们摘下来吧。”

“好主意。”

“这两块牌子也许非常稀有，非常珍贵，可能会派上用场呢。”

彼得摘掉左边门上的牌子，试图把它藏在身上。牌子太大，这样做有点困难。他想到了一个好主意，要把它背到背上，于是，他庄严而神秘地转过身子。过了一会儿，他又夸张地把身子转了回来，伸出两只胳膊，把自己展示给赞赏的迪恩看。他已把牌子塞进背心里，用衬衫的前襟将它完全盖住。实际上，“进”这个黑体大字是印在他的衬衫上的。

“哟呵！”迪恩兴奋地说，“进先生。”

他把自己的牌子以相同的方式塞进去。

“出先生！”他打了胜仗似的宣布，“进先生和出先生。”

他们走近对方握了握手，爆发出阵阵笑声，高兴得前仰后合、浑身打战。

“哟呵！”

“看来，我们要吃一顿丰盛的早餐。”

“我们走吧——去科莫多尔饭店。”

他们挽着胳膊出了门，向东转到四十四大街上，朝科莫多尔饭店走去。

他们出来的时候，一名又矮又黑的士兵扭头看着他们。士兵脸色苍白，精疲力竭，一直沿着人行道无精打采地晃悠。

他走过来，仿佛要跟他们打招呼，然而当他们立刻目不转睛地向他投来令人难堪的、陌生的目光时，他不吭声了。等着他们歪歪扭扭地沿着街道走了大约四十步远时，才跟在他们身后，呵呵地笑着，小声地自言自语道：“哦，天哪！”他开心地重复了一遍又一遍，好像期待发生点什么似的。

与此同时，进先生和出先生客气地告诉对方接下来的打算。

“我们要喝酒，我们要吃早餐。不喝酒就不吃早餐，吃早餐就必须喝酒。两者是一个整体，缺一不可。”

“我们两样都要。”

“两样都要。”

天已经大亮，路人开始好奇地仔细打量这两个人。显然，他们在讨论，讨论给他们带来极大的乐趣。他们的胳膊仍然互相挽着，时时爆发出一阵狂笑，笑得头都要触到地面了。

到了科莫多尔饭店，他们和睡眼惺忪的门童互相爆了几句粗口，费力地推着十字形旋转门，然后穿过大厅。大厅里的顾客稀稀落落，看到他们都很吃惊。他们来到餐厅，一名困惑的侍者把他们领到角落里一张不起眼的餐桌旁。他们研究了一番菜单，无可奈何地彼此报着听不懂的菜名。

“没看到酒。”彼得责怪地说。

侍者听见他们在说话，既听不清又无法理解他们说的是什么。

“我再重复一遍，”彼得耐心而宽容地继续说，“菜单上没有酒，似乎说不过去，而且很令人不快。”

“看我的！”迪恩信心十足地说，“让我去收拾他。”他扭头对侍者说，“给我们拿——给我们拿——”他紧张地扫视着菜单，“给我们拿一夸脱香槟和一个……一个……大概是火腿三明治。”

侍者一脸茫然。

“去拿啊！”进先生和出先生异口同声地吼道。

侍者咳嗽一声消失了。他们等了一小会儿，这个时候，一名领班在他们浑然不觉的情况下，仔细地观察着他们。接着，香槟就送来了。看到香槟，进先生和出先生高兴起来。

“想想看，如果他们反对我们把香槟当早餐——想想看。”

他们俩都专心致志地想象着可能出现的可怕后果，但这对他们来说太难了。他们两人的想象力合在一起，也想不出一个人反对另一个人把香槟当作早餐的世界会是什么情形。随着“砰”的一声巨响，侍者拔出了瓶塞——他们的杯子里立即冒出了浅黄色的泡沫。

“祝你健康，进先生。”

“也祝你健康，出先生。”

侍者走开了；时间在流逝；酒瓶里的香槟在减少。

“真是——真是丢脸。”迪恩突然说道。

“什么丢脸？”

“一想到他们不让我们把香槟当作早餐就觉得丢脸。”

“丢脸吗？”彼得想了想，“没错，就是这个词——丢脸。”

他们又笑起来，号叫着，摇摆着，坐在椅子里前仰后合，对着彼此絮叨着“丢脸”这个词——每絮叨一遍仿佛都只会将这件事变得更加离奇古怪。

又过了美妙的几分钟，他们决定再要一夸脱酒。他们那位心急如焚的侍者赶紧和他的上司商量，这个谨慎的人下了一道含蓄的指示：不再给他们喝香槟了。他们的账单来了。

五分钟后，他们挽着胳膊离开了科莫多尔饭店，穿过好奇、盯着他们看的人群走在四十二大街上，再经范德比尔特大街到巴尔的摩酒店。在那里，他们突然灵机一动，临时起意，飞快地穿过大厅，然后又直挺挺地站着不动。

一到餐厅，他们就又旧调重弹。一会儿爆发出痉挛般的笑声，一会儿又突然大谈特谈政治、大学以及他们的性格是如何阳光灿烂。他们的手表告诉他们，现在已经九点钟了，他们模模糊糊地记得，他们参加了一个值得纪念的舞会，有些东西他们会铭记不忘。他们又沉迷于第二瓶酒里，他们俩只要谁提到“丢脸”这个词，两个人就会笑得喘不过气。餐厅在旋转，在晃动，一种奇妙的轻松感弥漫开来，也净化了浑浊的空气。

他们结了账，走进大厅。

就在这时，在这个上午，外面的门转到第一千次的时候，大厅里走进一位脸色苍白的妙龄佳人。她眼圈发黑，穿着皱皱巴巴的晚礼服。她由一个相貌平平的胖男人陪同，显然他是个不合适的护花使者。

这两个人在楼梯的最上面遇到了进先生和出先生。

“伊迪丝，”进先生欣喜若狂地朝她走过去，一阵风似的鞠了一躬说道，“上午好，亲爱的。”

胖男人用询问的目光看着伊迪丝，仿佛只要征得她的许可，他就会立刻把这人扔到路边。

“请原谅，这样说有点太随便，”彼得补充道，作为事后诸葛亮式的补充，“伊迪丝，早上好。”

他抓住迪恩的胳膊肘，把他推到前面。

“见见进先生，伊迪丝，我最好的朋友。形影不离的进先生和出先生。”

出先生走上前鞠了一躬；实际上，他走得太近了，腰弯得太低了，因此他朝前栽了一下，把手轻轻地放在了伊迪丝的肩膀上才算找着了平衡。

“我是出先生，伊迪丝，”他愉快地咕哝着说，“我们是进先生和出先生。”

“我们是进先生和出先生。”彼得骄傲地说。

伊迪丝被他们直勾勾地盯着，不过她的眼睛看着走廊上面那无数个黑点。她轻轻地朝胖男人点点头，他像公牛似的走上前，猛然用力地把进先生和出先生一人推到一边，他和伊迪丝从这两个人中间穿了过去。

但是，走了十来步远，伊迪丝又站住了——她指着一名又矮又黑的士兵，他正漫无目的地看着这群人，有点疑惑又有点吃惊地看着进先生和出先生构成的独特画面。

“那儿，”伊迪丝大叫一声，“看那儿！”

她提高了嗓门，声音变得十分尖锐，手指伸着，微微颤抖。

“那个士兵打断了我哥哥的腿。”

十几个人大叫起来；一个身穿燕尾服的人从餐桌旁站起来，机警地走过去；胖子像闪电一样扑向又矮又黑的士兵。接着，大厅里围了一小群人，挡住了进先生和出先生的视线。

但是，对于进先生和出先生而言，这件事在千变万化的大千世界中只是色彩斑斓的一个碎片而已。

他们听到吼叫声，看到胖子跳起来；画面突然模糊不清了。

接着，他们进了向上运行的电梯。

“请问去几楼？”开电梯的工人问道。

“随便。”进先生说。

“顶楼。”出先生说。

“这就是顶楼。”开电梯的工人说。

“再加一层。”出先生说。

“加得更高点。”进先生说。

“去天堂。”出先生说。

就在第六大街旁边，有一家小旅馆。戈登·斯特雷特在旅馆的客房里醒来，后脑勺很疼，浑身的脉搏都在病恹恹地抽动。他看着屋角落满灰尘的阴影，看着旮旯里那张陈旧的大皮椅上的破洞，椅子已经使用很久了。他看着地板上乱七八糟、皱皱巴巴的衣服，闻着香烟和酒精的污浊气味。窗户紧紧地闭着，外面明亮的阳光已经将灰尘飞扬的一束光柱照到窗台上——他躺在木床上，宽大的床头挡住了光束。他静静地躺着——昏昏沉沉、迷迷糊糊，眼睛睁得很大，大脑像一台没有上油的机器嗡嗡作响。

他看到灰尘飞舞的光束和大皮椅上的破洞后，一定又过了三十秒才意识到，他身边还躺着一个人；又过了三十秒，他才意识到他已经不可挽回地和朱沃尔·哈德森结婚了。

半小时后，他出去到体育用品店买了一把左轮手枪。然后，他乘着出租车来到东二十七大街上他的住处，躺在摆着绘画材料的桌子上，将一颗子弹从太阳穴正后方射进了头颅。

返老还童


一


早在一八六〇年，在家里生孩子是天经地义的事情。听说现在，天上的药神下令，孩子应该在空气中充斥着麻药味的医院里发出第一声哭喊，而且最好在时髦的医院里。因此，一八六〇年的一天，当年轻的罗杰·巴顿夫妇决定要在医院里生下他们的第一个孩子时，他们便超前了五十年。人们永远都不知道，这个不合时宜的决定是否影响了我即将记录下来的这桩奇事。

我把事情的来龙去脉告诉你们，你们自行判断吧。

在美国南北战争爆发前夕的巴尔的摩，无论是社会地位还是经济地位，罗杰·巴顿夫妇都令人羡慕。他们和这个家族以及那个家族都有着千丝万缕的联系，每个南方人都知道，这些家族让他们有资格成为庞大的特权阶级——人口众多的南方联盟的成员。在生儿育女这个迷人而古老的传统方面，他们还是头一次经历——巴顿先生自然非常紧张。他希望生个男孩，这样就可以把孩子送到康涅狄格州的耶鲁大学。巴顿先生本人曾在这所大学度过四年时光，当时大家都叫他“卡夫”，这显然是个别名。

九月里的一个清晨，为了这件神圣的大事，他六点钟就紧张地起床了。他穿好衣服，打扮整齐，就匆匆忙忙地穿过巴尔的摩的街道来到医院，心里琢磨着那个新生命是否已经在昨天夜里降生了。

走到距离马里兰男女共诊私立医院大约一百码远的时候，他看见他们的家庭医生基恩正从医院前门的台阶上往下走，他像洗手似的搓着手——所有医生都必须这么做，因为这是他们这个职业不成文的道德准则。

罗杰·巴顿，五金批发公司的总裁罗杰·巴顿先生向基恩医生跑过去，相当不顾在那个富有诗意的时代一位南方绅士应有的风度。“基恩医生！”他喊道，“喂，基恩医生！”

医生听见他的叫声，回过头，站在原地等他。当巴顿先生跑过来的时候，他那严肃的医生脸上流露出奇怪的表情。

“情况怎么样？”巴顿先生气喘吁吁地冲上去问，“生了吗？她好吗？是男孩吗？是男孩还是女孩？什么——”

“到底想问什么！”基恩医生厉声说道，他看起来有点不耐烦。

“孩子出生了吗？”巴顿先生恳求道。

基恩医生皱皱眉头。“哦，是的，我想是这样——算是吧。”他又丢给巴顿先生一个奇怪的眼神。

“我妻子好吧？”

“好。”

“是男孩还是女孩？”

“得了！”基恩医生心里突然蹿起一股怒火，大声吼道，“请您亲自去看看吧。古怪！”他恶狠狠地、几乎只用一个音节喊出最后一个词，然后转身抱怨道，“你以为这种事有益于我的职业声誉吗？要是再有一次就会毁了我——毁了任何人的。”

“怎么了？”巴顿先生问，他吓坏了，“三胞胎吗？”

“不，不是三胞胎！”医生用挖苦的语气回答道，“你还是亲自去看看，然后另请高明吧。是我把你带到这个世上来的，年轻人，我给你们家当了四十年的家庭医生了。可是，到你这儿，该结束了！我再也不想看见你或者你们家的任何人了！再见！”

然后，他突然转身，不再多说一个字，登上停在路边的四轮马车，扬长而去。

巴顿先生站在人行道上，目瞪口呆，浑身颤抖。发生了什么可怕的灾难？他突然失去了要进马里兰男女共诊私立医院的所有渴望——过了一会儿，他费了很大劲儿才强迫自己登上台阶，走进医院大门。

在晦暗的大厅里，一名护士坐在一张桌子后面。巴顿先生把刚才受到的羞辱咽进肚里，走到护士面前。

“早上好。”她愉快地抬头看着他说。

“早上好。我——我是巴顿先生。”

听到巴顿这个名字，女孩顿时一脸惊恐。她站起来，仿佛要拔腿而逃，她显然使出了九牛二虎之力才控制住自己。

“我想看看我的孩子。”巴顿先生说。

护士轻轻地发出一声尖叫。“哦——当然！”她歇斯底里地喊道，“在楼上。就在楼上。上——去吧！”

她指着上楼的方向，巴顿先生出了一身冷汗，他颤抖着转过身，朝二楼走去。二楼大厅里，一名护士端了个盆子朝他走来。“我是巴顿先生，”他努力做到口齿清晰，“我想看看我的——”

当啷！盆子掉到地上，向楼梯口滚去。当啷！当啷！它有条不紊地顺着楼梯往下滚，仿佛它也感受到了这位先生引起的恐惧。

“我想看看我的孩子！”巴顿先生几乎咆哮起来。他已经濒临崩溃了。

当啷！盆子滚到一楼。护士恢复了自控能力，朝巴顿先生抛了个十分轻蔑的眼神。

“好啊，巴顿先生，”她声音沙哑地表示赞同，“很好！但是，你知道今天早上我们都吓成什么样子了！真是稀奇古怪！以后，我们医院再也不会有半点好名声了——”

“快点！”他粗暴地吼道，“我受不了了！”

“那么，跟我来吧，巴顿先生。”

他拖着沉重的身子跟在她的后面。他们穿过长长的走廊，来到走廊尽头的一间屋子前，里面哭声一片——人们后来把这间屋子命名为“啼哭室”，也的确名副其实。他们走进去，只见沿墙摆放了六张漆成白色、带轮子的婴儿床，每张床的床头分别系着一个标签。

“那么，”巴顿先生喘着气说，“哪个是我的孩子？”

“喏！”护士说。

巴顿先生顺着护士的手指看过去，眼前出现这样一幅情景：一个看起来七十岁左右的老头，裹着宽大的白毛毯，勉强地挤坐在一张婴儿床上，几根稀疏的头发几乎全白了，下巴上拖着烟灰色的长胡子，被窗口吹进来的微风吹拂着，可笑地摆来摆去。他抬头看着巴顿先生，昏花的老眼里尽是困惑的疑问。

“我是疯了吗？”巴顿先生吼道。他的恐惧变成了愤怒。“这是医院开的恐怖玩笑吗？”

“对我们来说，这可不像是个玩笑，”护士哭丧着脸说，“而且，你是不是疯了，我不知道——我只知道，这个人的确是你的孩子。”

巴顿先生的额头上又冒出一层冷汗。他把眼睛闭上，再睁开，重新看了看。没错——他眼前的确是个七十岁的老头——一个七十岁的婴儿，他的两只脚耷拉在身子下面的婴儿床沿上。

老人平静地看看这个，又看看那个，过了一会儿，他突然用沧桑的、破锣似的声音说起话来。“你是我父亲吗？”他问道。

巴顿先生和护士大惊失色。

“因为如果你是我父亲的话，”老人气鼓鼓地继续说，“我希望你带我离开这个地方——或者，至少，让他们在这里放一张舒适的摇椅。”

“你到底是从哪里来的？你是谁？”巴顿先生疯了似的大声问。

“我不能准确地告诉你我是谁，”他生气地抱怨道，“因为我才刚刚出生几个小时而已——不过我肯定姓巴顿。”

“你撒谎！你是个江湖骗子！”

老人疲惫地看看护士。“这真是欢迎新生儿的美好仪式。”他用衰弱的声音发着牢骚，“告诉他，他错了，为什么不告诉他呢？”

“你错了，巴顿先生，”护士一本正经地说，“这是你的孩子，你不得不承认这个事实。我们要求你尽快将他带回家——就今天。”

“回家？”巴顿先生难以置信地重复着说。

“是的，我们不能把他留在这里。真的不能，你明白吗？”

“我很愿意回家，”老人满腹牢骚地说，“如果能让这些小孩子安静下来，这儿还是个不错的地方。可是他们鬼哭狼嚎的，我没合一下眼。我想吃点东西，”——说到这里，他提高了嗓门，用刺耳的声音表示抗议，“她们竟然给我一瓶牛奶！”

巴顿先生一屁股坐到儿子身边的椅子上，两只手捂住脸。“天哪！”他用极度恐惧的声音喃喃地说，“人们会怎么说？我该怎么办？”

“你必须把他带回家，”护士坚持说，“立刻带走！”

这个备受煎熬的人眼前不由得浮现出一幅清晰得可怖的怪诞画面——他走在这个城市拥挤的街道上，身边跟着这个令人毛骨悚然的鬼魂。“我不能带他回家，我不能。”他悲叹着说。

人们会停下脚步与他交谈，那么他该怎么说？他不得不向人们介绍这个——这个七十岁的老人，“这是我儿子，今天清晨出生的。”然后，这位老人会把身上的毛毯裹得紧一些，继续缓慢地朝前走，经过熙熙攘攘的商店、奴隶市场——有那么一个黑暗的瞬间，巴顿先生满心希望儿子是个黑人——经过居民区豪华的房子，经过养老院……

“好了！打起精神吧。”护士命令道。

“听着，”老人突然大声说，“如果你以为我准备裹着毛毯回家，你就大错特错了。”

“婴儿通常都用毛毯裹着。”

老人举起一件白色的小婴儿服，恶狠狠地把它抖得唰唰响。“看！”他颤颤巍巍地说，“这就是他们为我准备的。”

“婴儿通常都穿婴儿服。”护士拉着脸说。

“那么，”老人说，“我这个婴儿两分钟后就准备赤身裸体了，裹着毛毯身上痒，他们至少应该给我一条床单。”

“就这样吧！就这样吧！”巴顿先生赶忙说。他扭头问护士：“我该怎么做？”

“到街上去给你儿子买几件衣服。”

巴顿先生出去了，儿子的声音追着他传到走廊里：“再买个拐棍，父亲。我想要个拐棍。”

“咣”的一声，巴顿先生狠狠地关上了医院的大门。

“上午好，”巴顿先生紧张地对切萨皮克纺织品公司的售货员说，“我想给我的孩子买几件衣服。”

“你孩子多大了，先生？”

“大约出生六个小时。”巴顿先生脱口而出。

“婴儿用品部在后面。”

“呃，我不认为——我不确定那是不是我想要的。它是——他是个体形特别大的孩子。格外——呃——大。”

“他们有最大号的婴儿服。”

“男童服装部在哪儿？”巴顿先生问道，他突然改变了主意。他觉得售货员肯定识破了他那丢人的秘密。

“就在这儿。”

“哦——”他犹豫起来。一想到要为儿子穿上大人的衣服他就感到厌恶。哎，要是能找到一套特大号的男童服装就好了，他也许可以把他那又长又丑的胡子剪掉，把他的白头发染成褐色，这样兴许能够把最不堪的局面遮掩过去，兴许能为自己留几分脸面——更不用说保住他在巴尔的摩的社会地位了。

但是他在男童服装部发疯似的寻觅，也没有为新生儿巴顿找到合适的衣服。他责怪这家服装店，当然——在这种情况下，的确是应该责怪服装店的。

“你说你的孩子多大了？”售货员好奇地问。

“他——十六岁了。”

“哦，请原谅。我原以为你说的是六个小时。下一个走道那儿就是青年服装部。”

巴顿先生苦不堪言地走开了。然后他停下脚步，眼前一亮，指着橱窗里套着衣服的人体模型，大声说：“瞧！我要买那套衣服，人体模型穿的那套。”

售货员看了看。“哦，”他表示反对，“那不是儿童服装。也许沾点边，只不过那是参加化装舞会时穿的。你自己倒是能穿！”

“包起来，”顾客紧张地坚持己见，“我就要那套。”

吃惊的售货员照做了。

回到医院，巴顿先生走进育婴室，把包里的衣服可以说是扔给了儿子。“给你买的衣服。”他没好气地说。

老人拆开包装，诧异地看看里面的衣服。

“我觉得这套衣服有点滑稽，”他幽怨地说，“我可不想弄得像耍猴子似的。”

“你是在耍我！”巴顿先生凶神恶煞似的驳斥儿子，“管它看上去滑不滑稽，穿上吧——否则，我就——否则，我就揍你。”倒数第二个字听起很别扭，他咽了口唾沫，但是依然觉得就该这么说。

“好吧，父亲——”他努力表现得孝敬，让人觉得怪怪的，“你经多见广，就听你的吧。”

和以前一样，听到“父亲”这个词，巴顿先生心惊肉跳。

“那么就赶紧穿。”

“我在赶紧穿呢，父亲。”

儿子穿好衣服，巴顿先生失望地看着他。这套衣服包括带有圆点图案的袜子、粉红色的裤子和一件配有腰带的白色大领外套。长长的白胡子差不多垂到腰间，在外套上晃荡着。难看死了。

“等等！”

巴顿先生拿起医院里的剪刀，“咔、咔、咔”三下子，瞬间把儿子的胡子剪掉一大截。但是，即使做了这样的改善，整体效果依然不尽如人意。凌乱的头发，眼泪汪汪的眼睛，摇摇欲坠的牙齿，看上去很怪异，与这身花里胡哨的衣服格格不入。然而，巴顿先生已经铁了心——他伸出手。“走吧！”他厉声说道。

儿子信任地拉住他的手。“你准备怎么称呼我，爸爸？”他们从育婴室出来时，他用颤抖的声音问，“暂时叫我‘宝贝’，然后再起个更合适的名字，是不是？”

巴顿先生咕哝了一声。“我不知道，”他板着脸说，“我想我们就叫你玛士撒拉(1)吧。”

即使巴顿家的这位新成员剪短了头发，又把几根稀疏的头发染成不自然的黑色，把脸刮得锃亮，穿上目瞪口呆的裁缝为他量身定做的男童童装后，巴顿先生依然无法忽视这样一个事实：他的儿子作为他的长子还是让人觉得不体面。尽管因为年老体衰而弯腰弓背，然而本杰明·巴顿——他们给他起了这个名字而不是那个虽然恰如其分却会招致怨恨的玛士撒拉——依然有五英尺八英寸高。本杰明身上的衣服无法掩盖这个事实。他的眼睛已经退化，水汪汪的，看上去很疲惫，经过修剪和染过的眉毛也无法掩饰这个事实。实际上，事先请好的保姆看了他一眼，就义愤填膺地甩手不干了。

然而，巴顿先生坚信：本杰明是个婴儿，就应该保持婴儿的样子。首先，他宣布，如果本杰明不喜欢喝热牛奶，他可以什么都不用吃了。然而，他最终被儿子说服，做出让步，允许儿子吃面包、黄油，甚至燕麦片。有一天，他给本杰明买回来一个拨浪鼓，不容商量地坚决让本杰明拿着“玩”。于是，老人一脸倦怠地接过来，每隔一会儿就听话地摇一摇，整个白天屋子里都响着丁零丁零的声音。

毫无疑问，拨浪鼓令他厌烦，然而同样毫无疑问的是，当他独自待在房间里的时候，他找到了比较安静的玩法。比如，有一天，巴顿先生发现他上个礼拜比以前任何时候抽的雪茄都多——这个现象几天以后得到解释，当他出其不意地进入婴儿房的时候，发现屋子里满是淡蓝色的烟雾，本杰明一脸内疚，正想把一个黑色的哈瓦那牌雪茄烟头藏起来。这当然需要狠狠地揍本杰明一顿，但是，巴顿先生发现，他下不去手。他只是警告儿子，这样做会“阻碍他的发育”。

然而，他依然固执己见。他带回铅制的士兵、玩具火车，也带回用棉花填充的、喜气洋洋的大型动物玩偶。而且，为了让自己创造的幻觉完美无瑕——至少是为了他自己——他热切地问玩具店的售货员，“如果婴儿把粉红色的鸭子填进嘴里，上面的漆会不会脱落？”但是，尽管父亲竭尽所能，本杰明却丝毫不感兴趣。他会悄悄地从后面的楼梯溜下去，抱着一卷《大英百科全书》回到婴儿房，全神贯注地看上一个下午，他的棉花奶牛和挪亚方舟则待在地上备受冷落。他这样冥顽不化，使巴顿先生的努力几乎化为乌有。

起初，这件事在巴尔的摩引起的轰动十分惊人。这场灾难可能会让巴顿一家以及他们的亲人付出什么样的社会代价无法估量，因为内战的爆发分散了这座城市的目光。有几个始终彬彬有礼的人想恭维一下这对父母，他们绞尽脑汁——终于想出一个绝妙的说法，他们说这个婴儿很像他的祖父，因为他的这种公认的衰老状态，是所有七十岁的老人所具有的普遍特征，这个事实无法否认。罗杰·巴顿夫妇很不高兴，本杰明的祖父则觉得受到了天大的侮辱。

离开医院后，本杰明就接受了身不由己的生活。几个小男孩被人领来见他，他和他们一起度过了一个别别扭扭的下午，他努力对玩具和弹珠游戏表现出兴趣——他甚至成功地用弹弓射出一块石头，打破了厨房的窗户，这件事虽然是偶然为之，却成为让他父亲心中窃喜的丰功伟绩。

此后，本杰明每天都力图弄坏点什么，然而，他做这些事情只是因为父亲希望如此，而他天生孝顺。

当祖父最初的排斥情绪渐渐消退，本杰明和这位先生开始从彼此的陪伴中得到莫大的快乐。尽管年龄悬殊，经历也很不相同，然而他们却像好朋友一样一坐便是几个小时，枯燥乏味、乐此不疲地慢慢谈论着一天里发生的事情。本杰明觉得在祖父面前比在父母面前更加自在——他们似乎总是对他怀有一种敬畏之情，而且尽管他们对他独断专行，却总称他为“先生”。

对于一出生就这么年老体衰、心智成熟，他和别人一样困惑不解。他翻阅医疗杂志，却发现这种情况没有先例。在父亲的催促下，他诚心诚意地尝试和其他男孩子一起玩，也经常参加比较温和的运动——足球运动太剧烈了，他怕万一骨折了，他这把老骨头就再也无法愈合了。

他五岁的时候被送到幼儿园，开始上艺术课，把绿色的纸粘贴到橘色的纸上，把彩色的地图拼起来，没完没了地用纸板做假项链。这些事情，他常常做着做着就打起瞌睡来，这个习惯让年轻的老师既恼火又害怕。令他释然的是，她向他的父母告状，然后他就被父母领回家了。罗杰·巴顿夫妇告诉朋友们，他们觉得他太小了。

到了十二岁，父母已经对他习以为常。事实上，习惯的力量如此强大，以至于他们不再觉得他和其他任何一个孩子有什么两样——只是有时候，某个怪异现象还能让他们想起这个事实。然而，在他过完十二岁生日后的几个礼拜里，有一天，在照镜子的时候，本杰明有了一个，或者说他自以为有了一个十分惊人的发现。是不是他的眼睛在欺骗他？或者说，是不是在他十二年的生命历程中，他的头发在染发剂的掩护下，从白色变成了银灰色？他脸上像网一样的皱纹是不是变得没有以前明显了？他的皮肤是不是变得健康了，结实了，甚至还有那么一点像被冻红的颜色？他说不上来，他只知道，少年时代的他，不再弯腰弓背了，健康状况也好转了。

“可能——？”他心想，或者更确切地说，他几乎不敢这样想。

他去找父亲。“我长大了，”他毅然决然地宣布，“我想穿长裤。”

父亲犹豫了一下。“哦，”他终于说道，“我不知道。十四岁才能穿长裤子——可你才十二岁。”

“但是你不得不承认，”本杰明抗议道，“我看起来比实际年龄长得高。”

父亲神思恍惚地看看他。“哦，这个我不确定，”他说，“我十二岁时看起来也有你现在这么高。”

这并非事实——这完全是因为罗杰·巴顿认为儿子很正常，默默地做出了自我妥协。

他们终于达成一致意见：本杰明要继续染发，要更加努力地和同龄的孩子玩耍，不能戴眼镜，走路时不能拄拐杖。作为交换条件，他可以平生第一次穿长裤……

本杰明·巴顿十二岁和二十一岁之间的岁月乏善可陈，我几乎不打算说什么，只需点明，这些年很正常，他没有继续长高就足够了。本杰明十八岁时，他的身板像五十岁的人一样挺了起来；头发密了，而且变成深灰色了；步伐稳健了；声音也不再颤抖，不再沧桑了，反而变成年轻而健康的男中音了。因此，父亲送他去康涅狄格参加耶鲁大学的入学考试。本杰明通过了考试，成为一名新生。

入学后的第三天，本杰明·巴顿接到学院教务主任哈特先生的通知，让本杰明到他的办公室，他要为本杰明制定学习进度表。本杰明照照镜子，觉得他的头发需要重新染成褐色，他心急火燎地翻箱倒柜，却发现装染发剂的瓶子不见了。然后，他想起来了——染发剂昨天已经用完，他把瓶子扔掉了。

他左右为难。五分钟后，他就应该到教务主任的办公室了。似乎来不及了——他必须守时，他的确很守时。

“上午好，”教务主任客气地说，“您是来帮儿子咨询情况的吗？”

“哦，实际上，我就是巴顿——”本杰明说，但是哈特先生打断了他的话。

“很高兴见到您，巴顿先生。我正在等您的儿子，他马上就到。”

“我就是！”本杰明突然大声说道，“我是个新生。”

“什么！”

“我是个新生！”

“你肯定在开玩笑。”

“根本没开玩笑。”

教务主任皱起眉头，看看他的胸卡。“喏，这儿写着呢，本杰明·巴顿，十八岁。”

“我就是十八岁。”本杰明毫不含糊地说，他的脸微微泛红。

教务主任不耐烦地看着他。“现在，巴顿先生，你肯定不能指望我相信你的话。”

本杰明无奈地笑了笑。“我就是十八岁。”他重复道。

教务主任绷着脸指着门口。“滚出去，”他说，“滚出这所学校，滚出这个城市。你是个危险的疯子。”

“我就是十八岁。”

哈特先生打开门。“荒唐！”他大声说，“你这把岁数了，还想以新生的身份来上学。十八岁，是吗？好吧，我给你十八分钟，滚出这个城市。”

本杰明·巴顿高傲地走出办公室，在大厅里等候的五六个本科生好奇地望着他的背影。他走了几步，回头对站在门口、怒容满面的教务主任语气铿锵地重复道：“我就是十八岁！”

学生们哄堂大笑，他在这笑声中走开了。

然而，命中注定他没这么容易逃开。在他伤心地去火车站的路上，他发现身后跟了一群大学生，然后变成一大群，最后变成密密匝匝的一大片。人们以讹传讹，说一个疯子考上了耶鲁大学，还企图假装成十八岁的青年。大学里沸沸扬扬，学生们接连不断地跑出教室，足球队也不训练了，加入到乱哄哄的人群中。教授的妻子们不顾身份地跟在队伍后面大喊大叫，帽子也挤歪了，裙撑也扭到一边去了。队伍里议论纷纷，对本杰明·巴顿评头论足，句句戳在他脆弱的心窝里。

“他一定是永世流浪的犹太人(2)！”

“他这把年纪应该去上预备学校！”

“瞧瞧这位神童！”

“他以为这是养老院呐！”

“去哈佛大学吧！”

本杰明加快步伐，很快就飞奔起来。他要让他们看看！他会上哈佛大学，他们会为这些荒谬的嘲弄付出代价！

安全地登上开往巴尔的摩的火车后，他把头伸出窗外。“你们会后悔的！”他大声喊道。

“哈——哈！”大学生们大笑起来。“哈——哈——哈！”这是耶鲁大学犯下的最大的错误……





五


一八八〇年，本杰明·巴顿二十岁。生日这天，他因为去罗杰·巴顿五金批发公司为父亲工作而变得不同凡响。就在这一年，他开始“出去社交”——也就是说，父亲坚持带他去参加了几个时髦舞会。罗杰·巴顿现在五十岁，他和儿子待在一起的时间越来越多了——事实上，自从本杰明不再染发（他的头发依然是灰色），他们的年龄看上去不相上下，可能会被误认为兄弟。

八月里的一个夜晚，他们穿着晚礼服登上四轮马车，赶往位于巴尔的摩郊外的谢夫林乡村俱乐部参加一个舞会。这是个美妙的夜晚。一轮满月洒着清辉，把道路映照得像白金似的闪闪发亮，晚开的花朵向静谧的空气吐露芳香，仿佛漫不经心的浅笑。铺满花草的乡野非常开阔，到处是明亮的麦田，月色迷离，恰如白天。如此美好的月夜，要是不让人们心醉神迷几乎是不可能的——几乎。

“干货行业大有前途。”罗杰·巴顿说。他没什么精神追求——他的审美处于初级阶段。

“像我这样的老朽学不了新技能了，”他具有深刻的洞察力，“你们这些生龙活虎的年轻人才大有前途啊。”

道路的远处，谢夫林乡村俱乐部的灯光在他们的视野里飘飘忽忽，如泣如诉的音乐不绝于耳——这大概是优雅哀婉的小提琴或是月光下银色的麦浪奏出的乐章。

他们在一辆气派的布鲁厄姆马车后面停下来，上面的人正从马车的门口走出来。先是一位女士，接着是一位年长的绅士，再接着是另一位女士，她年轻貌美，美得简直会让人犯罪。本杰明大吃一惊，体内仿佛发生了神奇的化学反应，身体元素好像被溶解和重新组合。一道电流传遍全身，他面红耳赤，心跳加快。他第一次尝到了恋爱的滋味。

女孩苗条娇嫩，月亮给她的秀发镀了一层银光，而走廊里哔剥作响的煤气灯则把它照得像蜂蜜一样金黄透亮。她的肩上披着一件鹅黄色的西班牙小披风，上面点缀着黑蝴蝶图案；撑开的裙裾下面，一双小脚仿佛两颗闪闪发光的纽扣。

罗杰·巴顿歪着头看着儿子。“那位姑娘，”他说，“是年轻的希尔德加德·蒙克利夫，蒙克利夫将军的女儿。”

本杰明心不在焉地点点头。“漂亮的小东西。”他淡淡地说。然而当黑人男孩为他们引着路走开的时候，他又说：“爸爸，你可不可以把我引荐给她。”

他们来到以蒙克利夫小姐为中心的人群中。由于接受了旧式传统教育，她在本杰明面前显得谦恭有礼。是的，他可以请她跳舞。他向她表示感谢，然后走开了——跌跌撞撞地走开了。

轮到他请她跳舞前的那段时间非常漫长。他站在墙边，沉默地、神秘地、用要置人于死地的目光注视着巴尔的摩那些年轻的纨绔子弟，他们的脸上洋溢着热烈的倾慕之情，围着希尔德加德·蒙克利夫团团转。本杰明觉得他们非常可恶，他们那么兴奋，真是令人受不了！他们那卷曲的棕色胡须在他内心深处激起一种类似于消化不良的情感。

然而，一轮到他自己，他立即和她踏着巴黎最新流行的华尔兹舞曲滑入灯光变幻的舞池，他的嫉妒和焦虑就像覆盖在心头的雪花一样融化了。他意乱情迷，觉得生活才刚刚开始。

“我们到这儿的时候，你和你哥哥也刚好到，是吗？”希尔德加德抬头望着他说，她的眼睛好像明亮的蓝色搪瓷。

本杰明不知如何回答。如果她误认为他是父亲的弟弟，是不是最好向她说明情况呢？他想起耶鲁大学的经历，决定将错就错。反驳女士的见解是不礼貌的；用他那荒唐的身世破坏这良辰美景是有罪的。以后再说吧，也许还有机会。因此他点点头，微笑着听她说话，觉得非常幸福。

“我喜欢你这个年纪的人，”希尔德加德告诉他，“年轻男子非常无知。他们对我说，他们上大学时喝了多少香槟，赌博输掉多少钱。像你这个年纪的人知道如何欣赏女性。”

本杰明觉得自己马上就想向她求婚——他竭力克制住这个冲动。

“你正处在浪漫的年纪，”她接着说，“五十岁的年纪。二十五岁太功利；三十岁过于劳顿；四十岁故事太多，需要彻底吸完一根雪茄才能讲完；六十岁——哦，六十岁又离七十岁近在咫尺；只有五十岁是恰到好处的年纪。我喜欢五十岁。”

本杰明觉得五十岁是个值得骄傲的年纪。他巴不得自己五十岁了。

“我一直说，”希尔德加德继续说，“我宁愿嫁给一个五十岁的人，受他呵护；而不愿嫁给一个三十岁的人，去照顾他。”

这个夜晚余下的时间，本杰明都沉浸在朦朦胧胧的甜蜜之中。希尔德加德又给了他两个和她共舞的机会。那天他们发现，他们在任何问题上都能一拍即合。下个礼拜日，她要和他一起乘车兜风，进一步谈论这些问题。

黎明前，他们乘着四轮马车回家去，第一群蜜蜂已经在嗡嗡歌唱，苍白的月光照在清凉的露珠上，本杰明恍恍惚惚地听见父亲在谈五金批发的事。

“……除了锤子和钉子，你觉得我们还应把重点放在哪里？”老巴顿说。

“爱情。”本杰明心不在焉地说。

“手柄(3)？”罗杰·巴顿吃惊地说，“哦，我刚才已经说过手柄了。”

本杰明眼神迷茫地看着他，这时东方的天空突然射出一道光芒，一只白头翁在一棵生机勃勃的树上打了个哈欠，发出了尖锐的叫声……





六


六个月后，希尔德加德·蒙克利夫小姐与本杰明·巴顿先生订婚的消息传了出来（我之所以说“传了出来”，是因为蒙克利夫将军声称，他宁愿倒在自己的军刀上也不愿公开这件事），巴尔的摩社交界的亢奋程度简直可以用狂热病来形容。人们又想起本杰明原本几乎已经被淡忘了的身世，一时之间，谣言四起，炮制出一桩令人难以置信的丑闻。人们说本杰明实际上是罗杰·巴顿的父亲，也有人说他是罗杰·巴顿蹲了四十年大牢的弟弟，还有人说他是乔装改扮的约翰·威尔克斯·布斯——最后一个说法是，他的头上长了两个锥形的小角。

纽约报纸的礼拜日增补版也极尽夸张之能事，还配上了令人咋舌的速写插图。插图上，本杰明的身体分别是鱼、蛇，甚至是硬邦邦的铜块。新闻界争相报道，他被称作“马里兰的神秘人物”。然而通常情况下，真实的故事总是鲜为人知。

然而，大家都赞同蒙克利夫将军的观点，认为一个可爱的姑娘本来可以嫁给巴尔的摩的任何一个爱慕者，却投进一个毫无疑问有五十岁的老男人的怀抱，真是“罪过”。罗杰·巴顿先生徒劳地把儿子的出生证明用大号字体刊登在巴尔的摩的《火焰》报上，根本没人相信。只要看看本杰明就一目了然了。

而与这件事息息相关的两个当事人却毫不动摇。关于未婚夫的虚假传言如此之多，希尔德加德一概坚决拒绝相信，甚至包括那个真实的故事。蒙克利夫将军向她指出，五十岁——或者说，至少看起来像五十岁的男人死亡率很高，没有用；他告诉她，五金批发行业不稳定，依然没有用。希尔德加德情愿嫁给一个成熟的人——而且，她真的嫁给他了……





七


至少在一件事情上，希尔德加德·蒙克利夫的朋友们判断有误。五金批发生意兴隆得令人吃惊。在本杰明·巴顿结婚的一八八〇年和他父亲退休的一八九五年之间的十五年间，他们家的财富翻了一番——而这主要归功于公司里的这位年轻人。

不用说，巴尔的摩最终敞开怀抱接纳了这对夫妇。甚至是年迈的蒙克利夫将军也和女婿和解了，因为本杰明·巴顿资助他出版了曾被九家著名出版社拒绝的二十卷《内战史》。

本杰明自身在这十五年中也发生了许多变化。他血管里流淌的血液好像获得了新的活力。清晨起床后，他迈着轻快的步子，走在洒满阳光的繁忙道路上，为锤子和钉子的运输问题忙得不亦乐乎。就在一八九〇年，他发起了一场著名的企业变革：他提议，货箱上的所有钉子均归承运人所有，这项提议成为由首席法官福塞尔批准的一道法律条例，而且每年为罗杰·巴顿五金批发公司节省了六百多颗钉子。

另外，本杰明发现，他越来越热衷于声色犬马的生活。特别是作为巴尔的摩城首个拥有并会开汽车的人，他越来越对此事沾沾自喜。同龄人在街上看见他身体健康，精力充沛，都羡慕不已。

“他好像一年比一年更年轻。”他们会这么说。而且如果说现年六十五岁的罗杰·巴顿当初没有以合适的态度欢迎儿子的到来，那么最后，他则以极力奉承的方式对他进行了补偿。

不过在这里，我们要谈一个令人不快的话题，这个话题还是一笔带过的好。只有一件事令本杰明·巴顿烦恼：妻子对他不再具有吸引力了。

当时，希尔德加德已经三十五岁了，儿子罗斯科已经十四岁了。他们刚结婚时，本杰明非常崇拜她。然而，随着时间的推移，她那蜂蜜一样金黄透亮的秀发变成了枯黄色，蓝色搪瓷一般的眼睛变得像廉价的陶罐一样。最重要的是，她太安于现状，太平淡，太知足，太波澜不惊，没有激情，对自己的好恶过于清醒。当新娘的时候，她硬“拖”着本杰明去参加舞会和宴会——现在情况恰恰相反。她虽然和他一起出去应酬，却毫无热情，她的激情永远被惰性吞噬掉了，这种惰性总有一天会降临到我们每个人的身上，而且一直会陪着我们到生命的尽头。

本杰明的不满情绪越来越强烈。一八九八年美西战争爆发时，家庭对他几乎没有任何吸引力了，于是他决定去参军。由于生意上的影响力，他被任命为上尉，实践证明他很称职。于是，他又被提升为陆军少校，最后又提升为陆军中校，正好赶上参加著名的圣胡安山战役。他受了点轻伤，获得了一枚军功章。

本杰明非常热爱军旅生活的生气和刺激，一想到要退伍，就觉得惋惜。但是他要关照家族的生意，因此还是退役回家了。一个军乐队在车站迎接他，并把他护送到家门口。





八


希尔德加德挥着一面大锦旗，在门口迎接他，甚至在吻她的时候，他的心都是沉甸甸的，他觉得这三年时间让他们付出了代价。她现在已经四十岁，头上已经斑斑驳驳地有了些许白发，这个情景让他觉得很沮丧。

他上楼走进房间，看到熟悉的镜子里自己的模样——他又走近些，忧心忡忡地端详着自己的面容，和战争爆发前的一张军装照比较了一会儿。

“上帝！”他大声叫道。这个过程仍在继续。毫无疑问——他现在看起来像个三十岁的男人。他没有感到高兴，相反，他很发愁——他越来越年轻了。他一直希望，如果他的生理年龄和实际年龄相吻合的话，他出生时的古怪现象就不会再发挥影响了。他打了个冷战。他的命运似乎很可怕，很不可思议。

他下了楼，希尔德加德在等他。她似乎很生气，他怀疑她是否终于察觉出什么异常了。他竭力缓和他们之间的紧张气氛，晚饭的时候，他用自以为很委婉的方式想探探她对这件事的态度。

“哦，”他故作轻松地说，“大家都说我看起来比以前任何时候都年轻。”

希尔德加德轻蔑地看着他，冷冷地哼了一声。“你以为这是值得炫耀的事情吗？”

“我不是在炫耀。”他忐忑不安地表明态度。

她又冷冷地哼了一声。“这个念头，”她停了一会儿接着说，“我想但凡你有自尊心，就该断了这个念头。”

“我能怎么办？”他问道。

“我不想和你吵架，”她反驳道，“但是做一件事总是有对有错。如果你下定决心要与众不同，我认为我是管不了你，但是我真的认为这很自私。”

“可是，希尔德加德，我无能为力呀。”

“你完全可以。你就是冥顽不化。你想特立独行，你一直这样，而且你还想一直这样下去。但是请你想想，如果别人都像你一样，将会是什么情形——这个世界会是什么样子？”

因为这个问题是与生俱来的，根本没有答案，本杰明无言以对。从这以后，他们之间的分歧越来越大。他很奇怪，她以前怎么可能对他具有那么大的魅力。

随着新世纪的到来，他发现，他对寻欢作乐的渴望愈发强烈，这进一步加大了他们之间的嫌隙。巴尔的摩的任何一个类型的任何那个一个舞会，都少不了他的影子。他和最漂亮的少妇跳舞，和最受青睐的社交界名媛聊天，他发现和她们在一起令人陶醉。而他的妻子，一脸倒霉相的贵族老婆子，坐在陪伴未婚少女的女监护人中间，一会儿带着目空一切的不满，一会儿又用严厉、困惑、怨愤的眼神盯着他的背影看。

“看！”人们会说，“真是可惜！这么年轻的一个小伙子拴到一个四十五岁的老女人身上。他一定比他妻子年轻二十岁。”他们已经忘了——人们总是善于遗忘——早在一八八〇年，他们的父母对这一对不般配的夫妻做出过同样的评价。

本杰明在家时越来越不开心，他用许多新的爱好来消解烦恼。他打高尔夫球，并且取得了巨大的成功。他热爱跳舞：一九〇六年，他成为“波士顿华尔兹”的专家；一九〇八年，他被公认为“马克西舞”的能手；而一九〇九年，他的“城堡舞”令全城的年轻人都惊叹不已。

他的社交活动当然在某种程度上影响了他家的生意，不过那个时候他已经为五金批发生意努力工作了二十五年，他觉得他很快就可以把生意交给儿子罗斯科打理，不久前罗斯科已经从哈佛大学毕业了。

事实上，他和儿子经常被人认错。这让本杰明很高兴——不久他就忘记了他从美西战场上返回家乡时曾经潜藏在心中的恐惧，开始天真地喜欢上了自己的容貌。春风得意的背后只有一件烦心事——他讨厌和妻子一起出现在公共场合。希尔德加德快五十岁了，看到她，他就觉得非常荒唐……





九


一九一〇年九月的一天——在罗杰·巴顿五金批发公司交给年轻的罗斯科·巴顿几年后——一个看起来大约有二十岁的男人，只身前往剑桥市的哈佛大学，成为一名一年级新生。他没有声明自己五十多岁了，也没有提儿子十年前从这所院校毕业的事，这是明智之举。

他被录取了，而且几乎立刻就成了班级里的领军人物，这在一定程度上是因为他的年龄好像比其他新生稍大一点，他们的平均年龄大约是十八岁。

不过，他的成功主要是因为在和耶鲁大学的足球比赛中，他踢得非常精彩。他骁勇善战，还带着冷酷无情的怒火，为哈佛大学赢得七分触地得分和十四分射门得分，而且还创造了一项纪录。那就是耶鲁队的十一个队员全部累倒在地，被逐个抬出球场。他成了大学里最著名的风云人物。

说来奇怪，到了大学三年级，他几乎无法为球队“建功立业”了。教练说他体重减轻了，而且队员中观察力比较敏锐的人发现，他比以前矮了。他无法再得触地得分了——事实上，他依然被留在球队里，主要是希望他的威名可以给耶鲁队带来恐惧，瓦解他们的信心。

到了大学四年级，他对球队已经没有丝毫贡献了。他变得非常瘦小、柔弱。有一天，他被一个二年级的新队员取而代之，这件事让他感觉自己受到了奇耻大辱。他开始作为天才而知名——一个大学四年级学生，肯定只有十六岁——他经常对一些同学的老于世故感到震惊。学习对他来说似乎比较吃力——他觉得知识太深奥了。他听到同学们谈论著名的圣米达斯预备学校，他们中有很多人都是从这所学校考入大学的。他决定大学毕业后，再去上圣米达斯预备学校，混迹于差不多和他一样高的男孩中间，日子会好过些。

一九一四年，他一毕业就回到巴尔的摩的家，兜里装着哈佛大学的毕业证书。那时，希尔德加德已经定居意大利，因此，本杰明和儿子罗斯科生活在一起。然而，尽管他受到儿子的礼遇，但是罗斯科显然对他并不热情——儿子甚至有一种倾向，他认为本杰明像个正处于青春期的孩子，喜怒无常、百无聊赖地在屋子里晃来晃去，有点碍手碍脚。现在，罗斯科已经结婚，在巴尔的摩社交圈里很有名望，他不想让自己的家族传出丑闻。

本杰明已经不再受初涉社交界的名门闺秀以及年轻的大学生们追捧了，他发现自己被孤零零地甩在一边，只有附近的几个十五岁的男孩子和他为伴。他又想到圣米达斯预备学校去上学了。

“嗨，”有一天他对罗斯科说，“我已经对你说过无数遍了，我想到预备学校上学。”

“那么，去好了。”罗斯科不想多费口舌。这件事让他厌烦，他也不想再做讨论。

“我不能独自过去，”本杰明无助地说，“你得帮我注册登记，再把我送过去。”

“我没时间。”罗斯科粗鲁地说。他眯着眼睛，忧虑地看看父亲。“实际上，”他接着说，“你最好不要执迷不悟了，你最好到此为止，你最好——你最好——”他停住了，他找不出合适的词汇，他的脸因此而憋得通红。“你最好幡然醒悟，回到正确的轨道上来。玩笑开过头了，一点都不好玩。你——你好自为之吧！”

本杰明看着他，几乎要哭出来了。

“还有一件事，”罗斯科接着说，“家里来客人的时候，我希望你叫我‘叔叔’——不要叫我‘罗斯科’，叫‘叔叔’，明白了吗？一个十五岁的孩子叫我的名字听起来很荒唐。也许，你最好一直叫我‘叔叔’，这样的话，你就会习以为常了。”

罗斯科狠狠地看了父亲一眼，转身离开了……





十


这次面谈结束后，本杰明闷闷不乐地在楼上徘徊，看着镜子里的自己。他已经三个月没有刮脸了，但是他发现脸上只有一层淡淡的小绒毛，似乎没有必要去管它。他刚从哈佛大学回来的时候，罗斯科来到他面前，建议他戴上眼镜，脸上粘上假胡须。刹那间，他觉得他刚出生时的闹剧似乎又重演了。但是假胡子让他皮肤瘙痒，而且让他觉得羞耻。他哭起来，罗斯科勉强动了点恻隐之心。

本杰明翻开一本儿童故事书《比米尼海湾的童子军》，开始读起来。但是，他发现自己总是对战争念念不忘。上个月，美国加入了协约国，本杰明想去参军。但是，哎，年龄要求至少是十六岁，而他看起来没那么大。他的实际年龄是五十七岁，即使这个年龄也是不合格的。

有人敲门，管家送来一封信，是给本杰明·巴顿的，信角上有一个很大的公章。本杰明急切地打开信封，高兴地读着信。信上说，许多参加过美西战争的预备军官正在被召回军队，并被授予更高的军衔，信里还附有一张委任状，任命本杰明·巴顿为美国陆军准将，并命他立即前去报到。

本杰明跳起来，他因为热血沸腾而微微颤抖，这正合他的心意。他抓起帽子，十分钟后便来到查尔斯街上的一家大型裁缝铺，用尖声尖气、缺乏底气的童声要求为他量身定做一套军装。

“想扮演士兵吗，小兄弟？”裁缝铺的伙计漫不经心地问道。

本杰明的脸红了。“喂！我想干吗不用你操心！”他生气地反驳道，“我姓巴顿，住在弗农山庄，这样你总该明白我出得起做衣服的钱了吧。”

“好吧，”裁缝铺的伙计犹犹豫豫地认可了他的说法，“如果你没钱，那么，我想你爸爸会有的。”

裁缝铺的伙计为本杰明量好尺寸，一个礼拜后军装就做好了。他大费周章才弄到合适的准将肩章，因为裁缝铺老板坚持认为，一枚精致的基督教女青会的徽章同样好看，而且更有趣，更好玩。

一天夜晚，本杰明瞒着罗斯科，不辞而别。他乘坐火车，来到南卡罗来纳州的莫斯比军营，他要在那里统领一个步兵旅。四月的一个湿热难耐的日子，他来到军营的大门口，付清把他从车站送到军营的出租车钱，转身看着站岗的哨兵。

“叫人帮我拿行李！”他居高临下地说。

哨兵用责怪的眼神看着他。“喂，”他说，“你穿着陆军准将的衣服要去哪里，小兄弟？”

本杰明，美西战争的老兵，怒火中烧的他猛然转过身，但是，哎，他的声音却是尖锐的童声。

“立正！”他大声吼道。他停下来喘气——然后，突然之间，他看见哨兵咔的一声并拢脚跟，把步枪举到胸前。本杰明暗暗露出满意的微笑，然而，他向后一看，笑容消失了。士兵并不是服从他的命令，而是看到了骑在马背上正威风凛凛地赶来的炮兵上校。

“上校！”本杰明尖声尖气地大声喊道。

上校策马勒缰，用炯炯有神的目光冷静地俯视着他。“你是谁家的小孩？”他慈祥地问。

“我马上就证明给你看我是谁家的小孩！”本杰明狠狠地训斥他，“还不赶快下马！”

上校放声大笑。

“你想骑马吗，嗯，将军？”

“放肆！”本杰明失望地吼道，“看看这个。”他唰的一声把委任状递给上校。

上校看完委任状，眼珠子都要鼓出来了。

“你从哪里弄来的？”他一边顺手把文件装进自己的衣袋里，一边问。

“政府寄给我的，你很快就会知道了！”

“跟我来，”上校说，他有点丈二和尚摸不着头脑，“我们到军部去商量一下。来吧。”

上校转过身，牵着马朝军部走去。本杰明只好跟着他，最大限度地保持着尊严——同时暗下决心，要狠狠地报复他。

但是这场报复未能实施。两天后，儿子罗斯科突然从巴尔的摩赶来，他行色匆匆，恼羞成怒，护送哭哭啼啼、被没收了军装的准将，回家去了。





十一


一九二〇年，罗斯科·巴顿的第一个孩子出生了。然而，在随之而来的庆祝活动期间，一个脏兮兮的、看上去十岁左右的小男孩，满屋子跑着玩铅制的士兵和玩偶马戏团，他是这个新生儿嫡亲的祖父。没有人觉得“这件事”值得一提。

没有人不喜欢这个小男孩，他那粉嫩可爱的脸上笼罩着淡淡的悲伤，但是对于罗斯科·巴顿而言，他的存在则是一种煎熬。用他这一代人的语言习惯来说，罗斯科觉得这件事非常“窝囊”。在他看来，父亲似乎拒绝接受六十岁该有的模样，他表现得不像一个“血气方刚的男子汉”——这是罗斯科最喜欢的说法——而是表现得不可思议，有悖常理。事实上，这件事只要他考虑半个小时就几乎会发疯。罗斯科相信“生龙活虎的人”应该保持年轻的心态，但是弄到这个份上是——是——是窝囊的表现。罗斯科不愿往下想了。

五年后，罗斯科的儿子已经长大，能够和小本杰明在同一个保姆的照看下做些简单的游戏了。罗斯科把他们两个同时送到幼儿园。本杰明发现，用彩色小纸条编成垫子、链子和奇怪而美丽的图案是世界上最令人着迷的游戏。一旦他表现不好，就得去站墙角——于是他就号啕大哭——但是大部分时间，这个赏心悦目的教室里都充满欢乐，阳光从窗子里射进来。时不时地，贝莉小姐将她那温柔的手放在他那乱蓬蓬的头发上，抚摸一会儿。

一年后，罗斯科的儿子升入小学一年级，但是本杰明依然待在幼儿园里。他非常开心。有时，当其他小孩谈论他们长大后想做什么的时候，他的小脸上就会蒙上一层阴影，仿佛他那幼小的心灵隐隐约约地感到这些事情是他永远都无法分享的。

日子过得单调乏味，他已经上了三年幼儿园了，但是现在他太小了，他不知道这些亮闪闪的小纸条有什么用。别的小男孩都比他大，他因为害怕他们而哭泣。老师和他讲话，尽管他努力去听，却根本听不懂。

他被人从幼儿园里接出来。保姆娜娜穿着浆过的条纹裙子，成为他小小世界的中心。在阳光灿烂的日子里，他们到公园里散步；娜娜会指着一个灰色的大怪物说“大象”，本杰明就会跟着她重复一遍。晚上，当保姆帮他脱衣睡觉时，他会大声地、一遍遍地对她重复着：“大象，大象，大象。”有时，娜娜让他在床上蹦着玩，这很有趣，因为如果你蹦完后立刻坐下来，它会把你重新弹起来。如果你在蹦起来的时候，拖着声音喊“啊”，你就会得到一种令人心醉的断断续续的声乐效果。

他喜欢从衣帽架上取下一根大拐杖，随处敲打桌椅，边敲边说：“打，打，打。”有人的时候，老太太们会对他咯咯地笑，他觉得挺有趣，年轻女士们想亲亲他，他不大情愿地接受了。下午五点钟的时候，漫长的一天结束了，他就会和娜娜一起上楼，娜娜用汤勺喂他吃燕麦片和又香又软的饭糊。

在他那童真的睡梦中，没有烦恼的回忆，他丝毫不记得大学时代的峥嵘岁月，也不记得那些让许多姑娘都心旌摇曳的光辉日子。洁白而安全的婴儿床壁、娜娜、一个经常来看他的男人以及一个巨大的橙色球，构成了他的整个世界。太阳快落下的时候，他就要睡觉了，娜娜就指着这个巨大的橙色球大声说“太阳”。太阳一落，他就睁不开眼睛了——没有梦，没有不开心的梦。

过去——他身先士卒，不顾一切地冲上圣胡安山；刚结婚那些年，为了他钟爱的、年轻的希尔德加德，他在这座城市的繁华中心整日工作到黄昏；结婚以前，他和祖父一起坐在门罗街老巴顿那座昏暗的房子里抽烟到深夜——所有这些记忆都从他的脑海里渐渐消失了，就像一场场虚无缥缈的梦，仿佛从来都没有存在过。

他的记忆模糊了，他记不清最后一顿饭，牛奶是热的还是凉的，记不清日子是怎样过去的——只有婴儿床和娜娜熟悉的身影。接着，他什么都不知道了。饿了，他就哭——仅此而已。一连几天的中午和晚上，他都只剩一口气了。周围充斥着喁喁细语，他也几乎听不见了，他只能模模糊糊地分辨出气味、光明和黑暗。

然后是一片漆黑，白色的婴儿床、在他头上晃动的影影绰绰的脸庞、牛奶温暖甜蜜的香味，一起从他的脑海里消失了。

钻石山


一


约翰·T.昂格尔出生于哈德斯——密西西比河岸的一个小城镇——他家世代是当地的名门。约翰的父亲拥有业余高尔夫冠军称号，打过许多激烈的比赛；昂格尔太太擅长发表政治演说，她的大名，用当地人的话来说，就是“从普通人到达官显贵”(1)无人不知，无人不晓；年轻的约翰·T.昂格尔刚刚十六岁，在穿长裤之前(2)，他就跳过从纽约流行开来的各种舞步。而现在，他要离家一段时间。对新英格兰教育的尊重是各省的祸根，他们每年都把最有前途的年轻人全部送去学习。这种想法在约翰的父母那里一样根深蒂固。除了波士顿附近的圣米达斯学校，别的学校都不合他们的心意——哈德斯太小了，装不下他们那才华横溢的宝贝儿子。

现在在哈德斯——假如你去过那里，就会知道——比较时髦的预备学校和大学的名字都无足轻重。居民们与世隔绝的时间太长，尽管他们的穿着、礼仪和文学表面上看起来与时俱进，然而在一定程度上，这些都是道听途说的产物。哈德斯人煞费苦心举办的宴会，连芝加哥牛肉铺里的小姑娘都会毫无疑问地泼他们一头冷水，认为“也许有点不像话”。

约翰·T.昂格尔离开家的前一天晚上，昂格尔太太由于母爱而变得有点糊涂，在他的行李箱里塞满了亚麻西服和电扇，昂格尔先生则送给儿子一个装满钱的石棉皮夹子。

“记住，我们永远欢迎你回来，”他说，“你放心，孩子，我们会让家里的火炉一直燃烧着。”

“我知道。”约翰哽咽着回答。

“别忘了你是谁，你的家乡在哪里。”父亲骄傲地接着说，“你不能做伤害自己的事情，你是昂格尔家族的一员——你来自哈德斯。”

于是，这一老一小握手道别，约翰泪流满面地离开了家乡。十分钟后，他已经走到城外，他停下脚步，最后一次回头张望。大门上那句维多利亚时代的古老格言似乎对他有着奇特的吸引力。父亲曾经几次想把它换成更加有气势、有活力的词句，比如“哈德斯——你的机遇”；或者在热烈相握的手上树一块醒目的“欢迎”招牌，在灯光的映衬下，直指苍穹。那句古老的格言有点让人提不起精神，昂格尔先生曾经这么想——然而，现在……

约翰就这么看了一眼，然后一脸决绝地朝目的地走去。当他转身离去的时候，哈德斯的灯光在天空下显得异常美丽，似乎充满了温暖和激情。




乘坐“罗尔斯——皮尔斯”牌汽车，从波士顿出发半个小时就到圣米达斯学校。没有人知道实际上到底有多远，因为除了约翰·T.昂格尔，别人都是乘坐“罗尔斯——皮尔斯”牌汽车去的，而且以后也许不会再有人像他那样去了。圣米达斯学校是世界上最昂贵、最高级的男子预备学校。

约翰的头两个学年过得很愉快。所有男孩的父亲都是土皇帝，暑假的时候，约翰去参观了时髦的旅游胜地。他很喜欢拜访过的那些男孩，他们的父亲给他的印象简直一模一样，他常常孩子气地感到奇怪：他们怎么会如此相像。他告诉他们他的家乡在哪里，他们就会嘻嘻哈哈地问：“那里很热吗？”约翰会挤出一丝微笑回答道：“当然。”如果他们所有人都不以这种方式开玩笑的话，他可能会表现得热情一点——他们最多改变一下说法，“你受得了那里的炎热气候吗？”这个说法他同样不喜欢。

第二学年过了一半的时候，约翰的班里来了一个插班生，他安静、帅气，名叫珀西·华盛顿。新来的同学待人谦恭有礼，穿着打扮即使在圣米达斯学校也依然显得气派非凡。然而，不知道是什么缘故，他总是和其他同学格格不入。唯一和他亲近的人就是约翰·T.昂格尔，然而即使是对约翰，他也绝口不提他的家乡和家庭。他很有钱，这不言而喻，然而，除了这点推论，约翰对他的朋友几乎一无所知。因此，当珀西邀请约翰到自己“西部”的家乡度暑假的时候，就好像为他饥饿的好奇心提供了一顿美味佳肴一样，于是，他毫不犹豫地接受了。

他们一坐上火车，珀西就一反常态，变得健谈起来。有一天，他们在餐车里边吃午餐边谈论学校里几个学生的性格缺点时，珀西突然改变口气，道出了一句惊人之语。

“我父亲，”他说，“是世界上最富有的人。”

“哦。”约翰礼貌地说。对于珀西给予他的信任，他不置可否。他想说“很好”，但听起来很空洞。他想说“真的吗”，但是没有说出口，因为这样说似乎是在质疑珀西的话。而他的这句惊人之语几乎是无可置疑的。

“最富有的人。”珀西重复道。

“我正在看《世界年鉴》，”约翰说，“上面说，在美国，有一个人的年收入超过五百万，有四个人的年收入超过三百万，而——”

“哦，他们简直不值一提。”珀西的嘴巴弯成半月形，作嘲弄状，“他们只不过是有几个小钱的资本家、金融界的小人物、微不足道的商人和债权人。我父亲不费吹灰之力就可以把他们的财产全部买下来，而且他们还不知道是谁干的。”

“可他怎么——”

“为什么他们没有他的所得税记录？因为他压根没有交过。至少可以说，他交了一点——但是根本没有根据他的实际收入交税。”

“他一定很有钱，”约翰单纯地说，“我很高兴。我喜欢有钱人。”

“人们越有钱，我就越喜欢他们。”他黝黑的脸上流露出热烈率真的表情，“复活节的时候，我拜访了施内策——墨菲。维维安·施内策——墨菲有许多鸡蛋那么大的红宝石和许多地球仪那么大、里面会发光的蓝宝石——”

“我喜欢宝石，”珀西饶有兴趣地表示赞同，“当然我不想让学校里任何人知道这一点，我自己就收集了许多。我以前一直都在收集宝石，我不集邮。”

“还有钻石，”约翰热切地继续说，“施内策——墨菲家有核桃那么大的钻石——”

“没什么了不起的。”珀西凑到约翰的耳朵旁，压低声音悄声说，“那简直不值一提。我父亲有一颗钻石，比丽兹——卡尔顿(3)饭店还大。”





二


蒙大拿的落日悬挂在两座大山之间，像一块巨大的瘀斑，在中了毒似的天空中伸出无数条黑色的动脉。费西村蜷缩在苍茫的天空下，渺小凄凉，无人问津。据说，村里有十二个人，这十二个忧郁而神秘的灵魂，是由一种神秘的生育力量所生，他们喝着几乎是光秃秃的岩石分泌出的、几乎没有营养的奶汁长大成人，繁衍成一个与世隔绝的民族。费西村的这十二个人和某些物种一样，最初由自然孕育而成，却又被自然抛弃，任其自生自灭。

远处，在瘀斑般的落日下，在苍凉的大地上，游弋着一长串闪烁不定的灯光。费西村的那十二个人像鬼魂似的聚在简陋的车站旁，看着这列七点钟的火车。这列从芝加哥出发的横贯大陆的特快列车从他们身旁飞驰而过。这列横贯大陆的特快列车通过某种不可思议的管辖权，每年在费西村大约停下六次。每当它停下来的时候，就会有一两个人从火车上下来，再登上一辆总是在黄昏的时候才会出现的轻便马车，朝瘀斑般的落日驶去。观看这个毫无意义、有悖常理的现象已经变成费西村村民的一种宗教仪式。为了观看而观看，仅此而已。他们当中没有人拥有至关重要的、能够激发好奇心或让人思考的想象力，否则，这些神秘的天外来客就有可能形成一种宗教。然而，费西村的人们生活在所有的宗教之外——甚至是最浅显、最原始的基督教教义也难以在这个寸草不生的石头山上挣得一席之地——因此，这里没有祭坛，没有牧师，没有祭品；只有每天晚上七点钟在简陋的车站旁聚集的那群悄无声息的人们，这群人在祈祷一个看不清的、毫无生机的奇迹。

在这个六月的夜晚，了不起的司闸员发出号令，这列七点钟的火车奉命停在费西村这个地方，让上面的人走下来（或让上面的货物卸下来）。如果费西村的村民想要将谁奉为神明的话，他们完全可以选择这位司闸员作为他们神圣的主宰。七点零二分，珀西·华盛顿和约翰·T.昂格尔下了火车，匆匆地从费西村那十二个被施了魔法、目瞪口呆、战战兢兢的人身旁走过，登上一辆显然不知道是从哪儿开来的轻便马车，绝尘而去。

半个小时后，暮色加重，变成一片黑暗，沉默的黑人司机向前面黑暗中的一个黑影喊了一声。一个光环应声射出，像一只邪恶的眼睛从深不可测的夜色中注视着他们。当他们驱车走近时，约翰才看清楚，那是一盏巨大的汽车尾灯。这辆汽车巨大、气派，是他之前见所未见、闻所未闻的。车身是由明晃晃的金属制成的，那金属比镍珍贵，比银轻便，轮毂上镶着亮闪闪的、绿色和黄色相间的几何图形——约翰不敢妄下断语，那究竟是玻璃还是宝石。

两个黑人如同人们在照片里看到的伦敦皇家仪仗队队员，穿着闪闪发光的制服，直挺挺地立在车旁。当两个年轻人从轻便马车上下来的时候，两个黑人用客人听不懂的语言向他们致意问候，这种语言似乎是南方的黑人方言中土得掉渣的那种。

“上车吧。”珀西对朋友说，话音未落，他们的行李箱已经被人扔到豪华轿车的乌木色车顶。“抱歉，我们不得不让你坐在那辆破车里走这么远的路，但是我们自然不能让火车上的乘客以及费西村里的那些倒霉蛋看到这辆汽车。”

“天哪！好气派的车啊！”车内突然传出一声惊呼。约翰看到，车内装饰着无数块以金线织物打底、点缀着宝石和刺绣、精美绝伦的真丝织锦。供两个男孩子尽情享受的两把座椅，铺着毛茸茸的坐垫，仿佛是用五彩缤纷的鸵鸟羽尾织成的。

“好气派的车啊！”约翰又发出一声惊叹。

“你是指这个玩意儿吗？”珀西笑了，“哦，一个老古董而已，只是用它往返于车站，接接人、送送人罢了。”

这时，他们正在黑暗中朝两座大山之间的裂缝行驶。

“一个半小时后，我们就到了。”珀西看看表说道，“我不妨告诉你，这里的一切你之前都没有见过。”

如果这辆汽车是约翰将要见识到的豪华景象的先兆，那么他的确需要做好大吃一惊的准备了。哈德斯盛行一种简单的虔诚，对财富的顶礼膜拜是那里的人们最重要的信仰——如果约翰在财富面前没有表现出卑躬屈膝，他的父母会认为这是对神灵的亵渎，会因此而仓皇逃走的。

现在，他们已经到达并已进入两座大山之间的裂缝中，路面几乎立刻变得更加崎岖不平了。

“如果月光能照进来，你就会看到我们正置身于大峡谷之中。”珀西费力地盯着窗外说。他朝对讲机说了几个字，男仆立刻将探照灯打开，一道强光照亮了整个山坡。

“到处都是石头，看到了吧。普通汽车在半个小时内就会被颠成碎片。实际上，如果路不熟的话，要想从这里通过，最好开辆坦克。看好了，我们现在正在上山。”

他们显然在向山上行驶，几分钟后，汽车就翻过一道山梁，他们看到远方升起一轮惨淡的新月。汽车突然停下来，车旁出现了几个从黑暗里冒出来的人影——他们也是黑人。两个年轻人再次接受黑人们的虔诚问候，他们的话语同样含糊不清、不知所云；然后黑人们便忙活起来，四根异常粗壮的电缆从半空中垂下来，用钩子勾住镶满宝石的汽车轮毂。随着雄壮有力的“嗨——哟！”声，约翰感到汽车缓缓地离开了地面——越来越高——已经脱离了两边最高的石峰——然后继续升高，直到能够看见洒满月光的山谷像波浪一般在眼前伸展，与刚刚抛至身后的乱石迷阵形成鲜明的对比。只有一面是石峰了——然后突然之间，他们的身旁以及四周全都空空如也，再也看不到岩石了。

显然，他们已经在一个刀刃般直插云霄的石峰之上了。过了一会儿，他们又开始下降，最后轻轻颠了一下，他们便落在平坦的地面上了。

“最糟糕的行程结束了，”珀西眯着眼看着窗外说，“只有五公里了，我们自己家的路——用饰面砖铺的——一路都是。这是我们的私家道路。父亲说，这里已经出了美国的地界了。”

“我们在加拿大吗？”

“我们不在加拿大。我们在蒙大拿的洛基山脉中段。不过现在，你在这个国家绝无仅有的、从来没有被测量到的五平方英里的土地上。”

“为什么没有被测量到？他们把它遗忘了吗？”

“非也，”珀西咧开嘴笑着说，“他们试图测量了三次。第一次，我爷爷贿赂了国家测量部的所有成员；第二次，他让人把美国官方地图随意涂抹了几下——就这样一直维持了十五年。最后一次比较麻烦。是我父亲搞定的。他让他们的指南针处在一个最强大的人工磁场中，又找人制造了一整套稍有误差、测量不出这块土地的仪器，然后用这套仪器与官方即将使用的那套仪器调了包。接着，他把一条河流改道，而且在河岸上建了一处貌似村庄的房舍——为的是让他们看见，并且让他们以为，在河流上游十英里远的山谷深处有一个小城镇。我父亲只担心一样东西。”他总结似的说道，“世界上只有一样东西可以用来找到我们。”

“是什么？”

珀西压住嗓门。

“飞机，”他低声说道，“我们有六架高射炮，而且到目前为止，我们一直都严阵以待——不过打死了几个人，还有许多人被关了起来。你知道，我和父亲，这种情况我们都无所谓，只是母亲和女孩子们很紧张。我们总会有猝不及防的时候。”

绿月当空，云彩一缕一缕的，犹如栗鼠身上脱落的毛团，从绿色的月亮上悠然飘过，仿佛鞑靼可汗视察时东方人献出的珍贵丝绸。约翰觉得恍如白昼，他仿佛看见几个少年在空中飞行，扔下的传教手册和专利药品传单犹如雨下，为那些被岩石阻断的绝望村庄带来希望的福音。他仿佛看见他们从云层里俯身凝视——观察着他要去的那个地方的一切——接着会发生什么呢？他们可能会被阴谋诡计诱导着陆，然后被囚禁起来等着被处死，再也无法顾及传教手册和专利药品传单——或者，他们可能没有落入陷阱，而那突然射出的烟雾和爆炸的子弹也能把他们击落到地面上——使珀西的母亲和妹妹们很“紧张”。约翰摇摇头，张开的嘴唇间悄然发出一阵空洞而诡异的笑声。这里隐藏着怎样令人毛骨悚然的交易？一个阴阳怪气的大富豪在耍什么样的花招？这里到底有着怎样可怕而又令人欲罢不能的秘密？……

此刻，栗鼠毛似的云彩已经飘远，蒙大拿的夜晚亮如白昼。巨大的车轮安然行驶在饰面砖砌的路上，他们环绕着静谧的、洒满月光的湖泊行驶；有一阵子，他们驶入黑暗之中，那是一片松林，散发着浓郁的木香，非常凉爽。接着，他们出了松林，驶入一条宽阔的林荫大道上，路面绿草萋萋，约翰欢呼起来，珀西向他示意，“我们到家了。”

一座沐浴着星光的精美城堡从湖边拔地而起，城堡依山势而建，有旁边山峰的一半高。大理石墙壁熠熠生辉，光影流淌，既匀称又优雅，既柔美又慵懒。城堡掩映于松海之中，与黑暗融为一体。众多高塔，沿山而建的护墙上镶嵌着纤巧的窗花，无数扇闪着金光的椭圆形、多角形和三角形的黄色窗户，无不展示出精雕细琢的鬼斧神工。闪着星光和蓝光的平台纵横交错，柔和得令人心醉。所有这一切像一首乐曲撩人的和弦，令约翰的心灵为之震颤。其中有一座塔，那座最高、基座最黑的塔，塔顶外面张灯结彩，营造出一种飘飘欲仙的境界——正当约翰心潮澎湃地仰望高塔的时候，从上面隐隐飘来一阵小提琴悠扬、有力的和弦声，这种洛可可式和谐的优美音乐，他以前从来没有听到过。接着，汽车突然停在宽阔雄伟的大理石台阶前，夜晚的空气中弥漫着花香。台阶上，两扇大门无声地打开了，明亮的灯光驱散了黑暗，映出一位女士优雅的身影，她将黑发高高绾起，向他们敞开了怀抱。

“母亲，”珀西说，“这是我朋友约翰·昂格尔，从哈德斯来。”

后来，约翰记得，他到那里的第一个夜晚，被满世界的绚丽色彩、摄人心魄的感官刺激、如情话般轻柔的音乐、美轮美奂的摆设、迷离的灯光、摇曳的人影弄得头晕目眩。一个白头发的男人端着饰有水晶圈的金色酒杯，站在那里，品尝着色彩斑斓的甘露酒。一位貌美如花的姑娘，打扮得像泰坦尼娅(4)似的，戴着用蓝宝石编成的发饰。有一间房子，墙壁是用软金和赤金砌成的，用手按一下，就会留下印记。还有一间房子，仿佛是按照柏拉图的终极监狱理念制造的——天花板、地板以及所有地方都由整块大小不同、形状各异的钻石砌成，和每个角落里高高的紫色灯光交相辉映，折射出无与伦比、连做梦都想象不到的白色光芒，令人眼花缭乱。

两个男孩在这些房子组成的迷宫中徜徉。有时，地板下面的灯光会打出奇妙的图案。这些图案有的粗犷奔放，色彩冲突明显；有的轻柔雅致；有的是一片白光；有的是繁复微妙的马赛克。这种图案肯定来自亚得里亚海域的某个清真寺。有时，在一层厚厚的水晶下面，他会看到一潭或湛蓝或碧绿的水打着旋，里面有活泼的鱼儿和彩虹般的水草。然后，他们踏着质地各异和色彩纷呈的人造皮毛，或者沿着乳白色的象牙游廊行走。象牙完好无损，简直像是用史前灭绝的巨型恐龙的整个牙齿雕刻而成的……

接着，记忆的场景依稀中发生了变化，他们在吃晚餐——每个盘子都是用两层实心钻石做成的，然而几乎很难看出它是两层。而且，两层钻石之间还嵌进去一层祖母绿宝石，祖母绿宝石被精心雕刻成奇特的图案，简直像一层薄薄的绿色气体。如泣如诉、柔肠百转的音乐不经意地从远处的游廊飘来——他坐在铺着羽绒的椅子上，椅子根据背部的曲线而微呈弧形，当他喝下第一杯波尔多葡萄酒的时候，他仿佛被椅子抱进怀里，被它征服。他恹恹欲睡，试图回答被问到的一个问题，然而，这甜蜜的奢华紧拥着他的身体，使他的睡意更浓了——珠宝、织物、美酒、金属器具使他眼神迷离，犹如坠入甜蜜的雾中……

“是的，”为了不失礼节，他勉力做出回答，“我的确觉得那里很热。”

说完，他还勉强地微笑了一下，接着，便一动不动、毫无反应了。他似乎轻飘飘地飞走了，餐桌上还有一道没有吃完的冰淇淋，像一个粉红色的梦……他睡着了。

醒来的时候，他才意识到已经过去了几个小时。他躺在一个非常安静的房间里，乌木墙壁，黯淡的灯光，灯光微弱得几乎无法感觉到，因而不能称之为灯光。年轻的主人就站在他的身旁。

“吃晚餐的时候，你睡着了，”珀西说，“我也快睡着了——在学校上了一年学，重新感受如此舒服的生活，真是莫大的享受。你睡着的时候，仆人们已经帮你脱了衣服，并帮你洗了个澡。”

“我这是躺在床上还是躺在云彩上？”约翰问，“珀西，珀西——趁你还在这儿，我想向你道歉。”

“为什么道歉？”

“因为当你说你家有一颗像丽兹——卡尔顿饭店那么大的钻石时，我曾经怀疑过你。”

珀西笑了。

“我本来就不指望你相信我的话。就是这座山，你知道的。”

“什么山？”

“城堡后面的这座山。作为一座山，它不算大。但是除了山顶大约五十英尺厚的草皮和砾石之外，剩下的全部都是实心钻石。一颗完整的钻石，一立方英里，没有一点瑕疵。你在听我说话吗？喂——”

然而，约翰·T.昂格尔又进入梦乡了。





三


早上。醒来的时候，他昏昏沉沉地感到房间里洒满了阳光。一面乌木墙壁沿着滑道推向一边，他的卧室一半沐浴在日光中。一个大个子黑人穿着洁白的制服站在他的床边。

“晚上好。”约翰收起信马由缰的思绪，含含糊糊地说。

“早上好，先生。该洗澡了，您准备好了吗，先生？哦，不用起床——我会将您放进浴池的，您只要解开睡衣就行了——很好。谢谢您，先生。”

仆人为约翰脱睡衣的时候，他依然静静地躺在床上——他觉得很好玩，也很快乐。他等着自己像小孩子一样被侍候他的这个黑不溜秋的庞然大物举起来，然而这种事情并没有发生。相反，他觉得床在慢慢地朝一边倾斜——他开始向墙边滚去。刚开始他大吃一惊，然而当他滚到墙边时，墙上挂的帘子自动收起。他顺着一个表面柔软的斜板向下滑了两码远，便轻轻地落进和他体温相同的温水中。

他看向四周，刚才把他送到水中的那个滑道轻轻地恢复了原位。他已经身处另一个房间，坐在一个凹陷的浴池里，头刚好露在地板上面。他的四周是由房间的墙壁、浴池壁和浴池底所围成的一个蓝色的水族馆。从他身下的水晶池底部望下去，可以看见鱼儿在琥珀色的灯光下游动，甚至悠然自得地从他张开着的脚指头下面游过去，他的脚趾和这些鱼儿只隔了一层水晶石。阳光透过头顶碧海般的玻璃照射进来。

“我想，先生，您今天早上可能会喜欢洗个玫瑰花加香皂泡沫热水浴，先生——最后也许可以再用冷盐水冲一下。”

黑人就站在他身旁。

“好的，”约翰傻傻地笑着表示赞同，“听候你的安排。”根据自己那点少得可怜的生活经验来吩咐别人如何给自己洗澡，会显得很自负，也很不识趣。

黑人按下一个按钮，温暖的水流便喷了出来，这水流显然是来自头顶。然而过了一会儿，约翰发现，水流实际上是从旁边的一个喷泉里喷出来的，水流变成了浅玫瑰色。浴池的四角安装了四个小小的海象头，香皂水从海象头里喷到浴池里。过了一会儿，装在浴池壁上的十二个小浆轮立刻将喷泉喷出的水和肥皂水搅拌成粉红色的泡沫，像一道五彩缤纷的彩虹，闪着迷人的亮光，轻柔地将他裹起来，在他的身体周围化作光彩熠熠的粉红色泡泡。

“先生，我把电影放映机打开，好吗？”黑人毕恭毕敬地说，“今天我还在里面放了一部好看的喜剧。或者，如果您喜欢的话，我可以马上将它换成严肃的片子。”

“不用了，谢谢。”约翰礼貌但态度坚决地答道。他太享受洗澡的感觉，不想分心。然而让他分心的事出现了。一阵悠扬的长笛声从远处传来，他马上全神贯注地倾听起来。一支空洞的短笛在为它伴奏，乐声仿佛一道瀑布，如这间房屋本身一样让人感到凉爽而澄碧，似乎比裹在他身上令他陶醉的一串串泡泡更加轻柔。

用冷盐水冲完身子，洗浴结束了，他浑身冰爽地走出浴池，穿上毛茸茸的睡袍，躺在同样毛茸茸的长沙发上，听任仆人为他涂抹精油、酒精和香料。然后，他坐在一张奢华舒适的椅子上让仆人为他修面、理发。

“珀西先生在起居室等您，”所有程序进行完毕后，黑人说，“我叫吉格瑟姆，昂格尔先生。我每天早上都负责照料昂格尔先生。”

约翰走出浴室，来到空气清新、阳光普照的起居室里，他发现早餐已经摆好了。珀西穿着白色的小羊皮灯笼裤，风流倜傥地坐在安乐椅里抽着烟。

吃早餐的时候，珀西给约翰简略地讲述了华盛顿家的家史。

如今当家的这位华盛顿先生的父亲，巴尔的摩勋爵，是弗吉尼亚人，是乔治·华盛顿的直系后代。内战结束时，他是一位二十五岁的陆军上校，拥有一个破败的庄园和大约价值一千元的金币。

年轻的陆军上校名叫费茨——诺尔曼·卡尔佩珀·华盛顿，他决定把弗吉尼亚的资产赠予他的弟弟，然后到西部去。他挑选了二十四个最忠实的黑人——当然，这些人都非常崇拜他——买了二十五张去西部的车票，打算在那里开垦一片属于他们自己的土地，开一个牛羊农场。

他在蒙大拿待了不到一个月，情况就变得非常糟糕，就在此时，他无意中有了一个重大发现。他在山里骑行时迷路了，一天没有吃东西，他已经饥肠辘辘。因为没有带枪，他不得不去捉松鼠。在追赶松鼠的时候，他发现，松鼠嘴里有一个东西在发光。就在它要钻进洞里的一刹那——上帝并不打算让他的饥饿者拿这只松鼠来果腹——它把嘴里的东西弄丢了。当费茨——诺尔曼坐下来考虑如何应对目前的情况时，却在无意中看见旁边的草丛里发出一道光芒。十秒钟后，他完全失去了食欲，却得到了十万美金。那只松鼠，虽然令人生气地坚持不肯成为他的美味佳肴，却赠给他一颗完美无瑕的大钻石。

那天深夜，他找到了回宿营地的路，十二个小时后，他带着所有黑人男子返回到松鼠洞边，在山坡上疯狂地挖掘。他告诉他们，他发现了一个莱茵石矿。因为他们当中仅有一两个人曾经见过一颗小钻石，所以他们对他的话深信不疑。当他的这一重大发现变得毫无悬念的时候，他发现自己反倒不知所措了。这座山是一颗完整的钻石——一颗没有任何杂质的完完整整的实心钻石。他把闪闪发光的样品装满四个马鞍袋，骑着马去了圣保罗。他想方设法在那里卖了六颗小钻石——当他想卖掉一颗大钻石时，一个商店店主吓得昏了过去。费茨——诺尔曼因为扰乱公共秩序而被捕入狱。他越狱逃走，乘着火车去了纽约。在纽约，他卖了几颗中等大小的钻石，换了大约价值二十万元的金币。他再也不敢出售特别大的宝石了——事实上，他不失时机地离开了纽约。珠宝界一片哗然，与其说是因为钻石大得异乎寻常，不如说是因为钻石的来历不明。一时间，谣言四起：在卡茨基尔山、泽西海岸、长岛、华盛顿广场下面都发现了钻石矿。从纽约出发的游览火车每小时一趟，上面挤满了扛着锄头和铁锨的人，奔往临近的各个黄金国(5)。而此时，年轻的费茨——诺尔曼已经踏上回蒙大拿的归程。

两个礼拜后，他估计这座钻石山大约相当于世界上已知的其他所有钻石的总量。然而，常规的计算方法无法计算出它的价值，因为它是一颗实心钻石——假如将它拿到市场上售卖，市场根本就无能为力。而且，如果根据一般的算术级数按照体积大小来计算的话，世界上所有的金子加起来也不够买这颗钻石的十分之一。而且，这么大一颗钻石，谁能拿它怎么办呢？

这个困境真是非同寻常。一方面，他是有史以来最富有的人——然而，他真有那么大的身价吗？如果这个秘密泄露出去，不用说，政府会采取什么措施来阻止人们淘金或挖宝的狂热。他们可能会立刻宣布对它拥有所有权并施行绝对管控。

他别无选择——他必须秘密地售卖这座宝山。他派人到南方把弟弟叫来，让他管理他的黑人随从——这些黑人，压根不知道奴隶制度已经被废除。为了让他们确信奴隶制度依然存在，他向他们宣读了一份自拟的声明，宣称福瑞斯特将军将溃败的南方军队重新整合，在一次激战中打败了北方的军队。黑人们信以为真，他们通过了一项决议，认为这是一件好事，并且立刻举行了奋兴仪式(6)。

费茨——诺尔曼带了十万元美金和两大箱大小不一、未经雕刻的原石，只身前往国外。他乘坐一艘中国平底船去了俄国。离开蒙大拿六个月后，他来到圣彼得堡。他租了一处不起眼的房子，立刻拜访了一位宫廷珠宝商，声称他有一颗钻石要卖给沙皇。他在圣彼得堡住了两个礼拜，历经无数次杀身之祸，从一个地方搬到另一个地方。整整两个礼拜，他都战战兢兢，只开了三四次宝石箱。

他承诺一年后带着更大、更好的钻石返回俄国，才被获准离开俄国，前往印度。然而，在他动身前，俄国宫廷的财务大臣分别用了四个不同的化名，将一千五百万美金存入他在几家美国银行的账户上。

他于一八六八年返回美国，这时已经过去了两年多。他去过二十二个国家的首都，和五个皇帝、十一个国王、三个王子、一个伊朗王、一个可汗以及一个苏丹约谈过。那个时候，费茨——诺尔曼估计，他的财富已经多达十个亿了。有一个守住秘密的方法他屡试不爽。他的每一颗大钻石出现在公共视野中不到一个礼拜的时候，他便开始放出风声，将他的钻石赋予了悠久的历史性和丰富多彩的故事性：自第一个巴比伦帝国以来，人们为了占有它，历经无数次死亡、奸情、革命和战争。

从一八七〇年一直到他辞世时的一九〇〇年，费茨——诺尔曼·华盛顿的经历简直就是一部漫长的、史诗般的发家史。当然，也有些无关痛痒的问题——他逃避土地测量，娶了弗吉尼亚州的一位淑女，并和她生下他唯一的儿子。由于一系列不幸的事件，他不得不杀死自己的亲弟弟。他弟弟不幸染上酗酒的恶习，酩酊大醉后，言语轻狂、目光呆滞，有几次差点危及他们的安全。不过，除了这些，几乎没有其他谋杀案来玷污他奋斗的幸福岁月。

就在他死前，他改变了策略。他拿出几百万元作为家用，把其余的所有资产用于买进大量的稀有矿石，再把这些稀有矿石以古玩的名义存在世界各地银行的保险库里。他的儿子布拉道克·塔莱顿·华盛顿沿袭了他的做法，甚至比他有过之而无不及。他把这些稀有矿石换成最珍贵的元素——镭——以便这些与十亿金币等价的东西可以装进一个和雪茄盒一样大的容器里。

在费茨——诺尔曼逝世三年后，他的儿子布拉道克决定收手。他和父亲从钻石山上得到的财富已经多得无法精确计算。他有一个密码本，他在上面记录了他在所惠顾的上千家银行中大致存入了多少镭，以及分别以什么化名存在哪家银行。接着，他做了一件非常简单的事情——他封了这座钻石山。

他封了钻石山，他从山上获取的财富足以支撑华盛顿家族的所有成员以及未来几代人无与伦比的奢华生活。他唯一关心的是，必须守住这个秘密。否则，如果秘密泄露，就有可能引起恐慌，他就会和他的家人——拥有钻石山的所有人，一起变得一无所有。

这就是约翰·T.昂格尔所拜访的家族。这就是他到达后的第二天清晨，在四面银墙的起居室里听到的故事。

吃过早饭，约翰走出雄伟的大理石大门，好奇地看着眼前的景色。整个山谷，从钻石山到五英里外怪石嶙峋的花岗岩峭壁，依然弥漫着一层淡淡的金色薄雾，悠然自得地飘荡在令人心旷神怡的草地上、湖泊上和花园上。随处点缀着一丛丛榆树，形成一片片优雅的小树林，和那将远山笼罩在墨绿色之中的大片浓密、挺拔的松树林形成了妙不可言的反差。约翰正在欣赏风景，只见三只小鹿，一只接着一只地从半英里外的树林里嗒嗒地跑出来，然后又笨拙而欢快地消失在另一片半明半暗、影影绰绰的树林里。在这片林子里即使看见一只山羊，或者在苍翠欲滴的叶子之间瞥见一个金发飘飘、面如桃花的仙女，约翰也不会觉得奇怪。

约翰一边这样美滋滋地想着，一边走下大理石台阶，稍稍惊扰了睡卧在台阶下面的两只毛皮丝滑的俄国猎狼犬。然后，他沿着一条蓝白相间的砖路向前走，这条路似乎并非特意要伸向哪个方向。

他玩得非常尽兴。这正是年轻的幸福之处，也是它的不足之处。年轻人从不活在当下，而往往一定要拿当下与寄寓着丰富想象的未来过不去——鲜花与金子、姑娘与星辰，这些只是无可比拟、无法企及的年轻梦想的预言和先兆而已。

约翰来到一个舒服的角落，这里有一大片玫瑰，散发着馥郁的芳香。他穿过一个公园，朝几棵树下的一片苔藓走去。他从未在苔藓上躺过，他想看看苔藓是不是真的很柔软，想验证一下人们把它作为形容词来使用是否有道理(7)。然后，他看见一个姑娘穿过草地朝他走来。他从来没有见过如此标致的姑娘。

她穿着洁白及膝的长裙，头上戴着一个木犀草编成的花环，花环上装饰着一片片晶莹的蓝宝石。她那粉红色的脚上露珠点点，这是她刚刚走过草地时沾上的。她比约翰小——最多十六岁。

“你好，”她柔声问候，“我叫吉斯敏。”

对约翰而言，她的意义已经远远超出这个名字本身了。他向她走去。走到她身边的时候，约翰几乎一动都不敢动了，因为他生怕踩到她那光溜溜的脚趾。

“你没见过我。”她轻柔地说。她那蓝汪汪的眼睛补充道：“哦，不过，你错过的真是太多了！”……“昨天晚上，你见过我姐姐佳斯敏。我因为对莴苣过敏，身体不舒服。”她继续轻柔地说。她的眼睛接着说：“我生病时很可爱——不生病时，也一样可爱。”

“你让我心动，”约翰的眼睛说，“我自己可没那么迟钝。”——“你好？”约翰用声音说，“希望你今天早上好多了。”——“我亲爱的。”约翰的眼睛颤抖着继续说。

约翰发现，他们已经沿着小径走起来。在她的提议下，他们一起坐到苔藓上，约翰心旌摇曳，已经无法判断苔藓有多柔软了。

他对女人很挑剔，哪怕有一点不足——脚踝粗啦，嗓子沙哑啦，眼睛无神啦——都足以使他失去兴趣。而此时此刻，他平生第一次和一位姑娘肩并肩坐在一起，而她在他看来简直是完美无瑕的典型化身。

“你来自东部吧？”吉斯敏饶有兴趣地问。

“不，”约翰直截了当地答道，“我来自哈德斯。”

也许是因为她没有听说过哈德斯，也许是因为她不知道如何赞美它，总之，她不再谈论这个问题。

“今年秋天，我要去东部上学。”她说，“你觉得我想去吗？我打算去纽约布尔琪女子学校。这所学校很严格。不过，你知道，我可以回到我们纽约的家，和那里的家人一起度周末。因为父亲听说，女孩走路时得有个人陪着。”

“你父亲希望你成为高贵的姑娘。”约翰说。

“我们的确高贵。”她答道，眼睛里闪着自豪的光芒，“我们没有任何人受过惩罚。父亲说，我们永远不该受到惩罚。我姐姐佳斯敏小时候曾经把他推到楼下，他只是爬起来，一瘸一拐地走开了。”

“当母亲听说你来自——来自你们的那个地方，你知道的。”吉斯敏接着说，“她——呃，有点吃惊。她说她还是个年轻姑娘的时候——不过，你知道，她是西班牙人，跟不上时代了。”

“你要在这儿待很久吗？”约翰问，他想掩饰吉斯敏的话对他的伤害。她的话似乎很不友好，在暗示他没见过世面。

“珀西、佳斯敏和我每年夏天都会来这儿，但是明年夏天佳斯敏要去纽波特。从今年秋天开始，她要去伦敦一年，她要进皇宫呢。”

“你知道吗，”约翰吞吞吐吐地说，“你和我第一眼看到的不一样，你挺老于世故的。”

“哦，不，不是这样的，”她吃了一惊，赶忙说道，“哦，我可不愿意这样。我想，老于世故的年轻人太平淡无奇了，是吗？我真的一点都不老于世故，真的。如果你这么认为，我会哭的。”

她伤心得嘴唇都在颤抖。约翰只得为自己辩解：

“我是开玩笑的，我只想逗逗你。”

“因为如果我真的老于世故，我反倒不介意，”她坚持说，“可我不是这样的。我很单纯，很孩子气。我从来不抽烟，不喝酒，除了诗歌别的书我都不看。我几乎不懂数学和化学。我的穿着很简单——实际上，我几乎不怎么讲究穿着打扮。我想，你说的老于世故根本和我不沾边。我认为，女孩们应该保持身心健康，尽情地享受她们的青春。”

“我也这么认为。”约翰真诚地说。

吉斯敏又快乐起来，她看着他笑了笑，一滴委屈的眼泪从她的眼角滚落下来。

“我喜欢你，”她亲昵地轻声说，“你在这儿的时候，打算一直和珀西在一起吗？或者，你会对我好吗？想想看——我一点恋爱经验都没有。这辈子连一个爱我的男孩都没有。父母甚至不让我单独和男孩子见面——除了珀西。我大老远跑出来，走进这片树林，是希望能碰见你，而且我的家人不会到这个地方来。”

约翰感到受宠若惊，他深深地鞠了一躬，腰弯得太低，屁股都翘起来了。这个动作是他在哈德斯的舞蹈学校里学来的。

“现在，我们该走了，”吉斯敏甜甜地说，“十一点的时候，我必须和母亲在一起。你还没有请求我吻你呢。我还以为，现在的男孩子通常都会这么做呢。”

约翰骄傲地挺直了身体。

“有些男孩子会这么做，”他答道，“不过，我不会。在哈德斯——女孩们不做这种事。”

他们肩并肩地回城堡去了。





六


阳光下，约翰站在布拉道克·华盛顿先生的面前。这位长者大约四十岁，表情高傲而茫然，眼光睿智，体格强健。每天早上，他的身上都散发着马——最好的马的味道。他拄着一根朴实无华的灰色桦木手杖，手柄上镶嵌着一大块蛋白石。他和珀西带着约翰正在四处参观。

“‘奴隶’们住在那边。”他用手杖指着左边沿着山坡优雅伸展的哥特式大理石回廊说。“我年轻的时候，有一段时间，曾经醉心于荒谬的理想主义而偏离了我一生的事业。那个时候，他们都过着奢华的生活。比如，他们每个人的房间里都有我为他们安装的瓷砖浴缸。”

“我想，”约翰讨好地笑了笑，揣摩着说，“他们用浴缸装煤炭了，施内策——墨菲先生告诉我，他曾经——”

“我觉得，施内策——墨菲先生的观点无足轻重，”布拉道克·华盛顿冷冷地打断了他的话，“我的奴隶是不会将煤炭装到浴缸里的。我命令他们每天都洗澡，他们都照做不误。如果他们没有洗澡，我就会命令他们用硫酸洗头。我不再让他们洗澡另有原因。他们有几个人患了感冒，死了。水对某些种族来说并不是好东西——只能饮用。”

约翰笑起来，接着，他决定用点头来明确表示赞同。布拉道克·华盛顿让他感到很拘谨。

“这些黑人都是我父亲当初带到北方的那些黑人的后代。现在大概有二百五十个人。你知道，他们与世隔绝的时间太长了，因此，他们当初的语言几乎已经无人听得懂了。我们从他们当中培养了几个人学说英语——我的秘书和家里的两三个贴身仆人就是这样。

“这是高尔夫球场，”当他们沿着四季常青、天鹅绒般柔软的草地漫步的时候，他接着说，“这里完全是一片绿地，你看——没有球道，没有深草区，没有障碍。”

他看着约翰愉快地笑了笑。

“笼子里有很多人吗，父亲？”珀西突然问道。

布拉道克·华盛顿惊得目瞪口呆，随口骂了句脏话。

“应该还少了一个。”他阴沉着脸突然说道——过了一会儿，又说道，“我们遇到麻烦了。”

“母亲告诉我，”珀西吃惊地说，“那个意大利老师——”

“一个可怕的错误，”布拉道克·华盛顿生气地说，“不过，当然，我们抓到他的可能性很大。也许，他在树林里晕倒了，也许跌下山崖摔死了。不过，即使他真的逃跑了，也没人相信他的话。不过，我已经派了二十四个人在附近各个城镇搜捕他。”

“还没有找到？”

“有点眉目。他们中有十四个人向我的代理人汇报说，他们每人杀死了一个和他长得一模一样的人。不过，当然，他们也可能只是为了得到赏金——”

他不说话了。他们已经来到一个大坑边。这个坑大约有一个旋转木马的圆周那么大，上面盖着一张牢不可破的铁网。布拉道克·华盛顿示意约翰过来，他将手杖插进铁栅栏里指着下面。约翰来到大坑边往下看，一片疯狂的叫嚣立刻从下面袭来。

“到下面的地狱里来吧！”

“喂，孩子，上面的空气怎么样？”

“嗨！给我们一条绳子吧！”

“有吃剩的面包圈吗，伙计。或者，弄几个吃剩的三明治来，好吗？”

“嗨，小伙子，如果你把和你在一起的那个家伙推下来，我们会给你表演一场让这个家伙马上消失的戏。”

“帮我把他剁成肉酱，好吗？”

天太黑了，看不清坑里的情况，但是根据他们奔放的语言和声音里透出的乐观精神和粗犷的活力，约翰断定他们属于精力充沛的美国中产阶级。然后，华盛顿先生收回手杖，碰了一下草地上的一个按钮，坑里顿时明亮了。

“这些人是爱冒险的海员，他们运气不好，发现了我们的‘黄金国’。”他说。

在他们的脚下，有一个碗状的大坑，坑壁好像是抛光玻璃，很陡。在微微凹陷的坑底，大约站着二十多个飞行员，他们一半身上穿着便服，一半穿着制服。他们仰起的脸上长满了胡子，有的怒气冲冲，有的咬牙切齿，有的悲观绝望，有的愤世嫉俗但不失幽默。除了几个面容憔悴的人之外，其他人看上去都营养良好，身体健壮。

布拉道克·华盛顿把一张花园椅拉到大坑边，坐了下来。

“嗨，你们好吗，伙计们？”他亲切地问道。

除了几个意志消沉而无法大喊大叫的人外，其他人一起破口大骂，骂声传到上面阳光灿烂的空气里。然而，布拉道克·华盛顿泰然处之。当他们谩骂的最后一点回声归于平静，他才重新开口说话。

“你们想出摆脱困境的方法了吗？”

他们当中不时有人对着上面大喊。

“为了爱我们和我们爱的家人，我们决定就住在这里！”

“让我们上去，我们就能找到办法！”

布拉道克·华盛顿等待着，直到他们重新归于平静。然后，他说道：

“我已经把情况告诉你们了，我并不想让你们待在这里，我对天发誓，我宁愿从来没有见过你们。是你们自己的好奇心把你们领到这里来的。无论什么时候，只要你们能想出一个可以保守我和我的秘密的万全之策，我都会给予考虑。然而，只要你们一意孤行，非要挖什么地道——是的，我知道，你们已经开始动手挖一条新的地道了——你们就不会有多大希望。理解这一点对你们来说并不难。你们整天在这里鬼哭狼嚎，说是为了你们亲爱的家人，但是，如果你们真的担心你们亲爱的家人，就永远不会干飞行这个行当。”

一个高个子挺身而出，举起一只手，想让囚禁者注意听他讲话。

“我来问你几个问题！”他大声说，“你是在假装正经。”

“太荒唐了。像我这种身份的人怎么可能对你们假装正经？你最好说西班牙人对排骨假装正经呢。”

听到这番刺耳的话，那二十多根排骨都低下了头，然而，高个子继续说道：

“好极了！”他大声说，“我们之前已经把这个问题谈清楚了。你不是个人道主义者，你也不是个正人君子，但是，你还是个人吧——至少你自以为如此——那么，你应该能够设身处地地替我们想想，这么久以来，你是多么——多么——多么——”

“多么什么？”华盛顿冷冷地问道。

“多么没有必要——”

“我可不认为这没有必要。”

“哦，多么残忍——”

“这个我们已经谈过了。如果是出于自我保护，那就算不上残忍。你们是军人，你们懂的。换个说法吧。”

“那么，好吧，多么愚蠢。”

“好吧，”华盛顿表示认可，“我同意你这么说。不过，想想看还有哪些办法。我说过，如果你们愿意，我会让你们所有人或者任何一个人死得毫无痛苦。我还说过，把你们的妻子、心上人、孩子和母亲绑到这里来，我会把这个地方弄得宽敞些，好让你们衣食无忧地度过余生。如果有什么办法可以让你们患上永久性健忘症，我会给你们所有人动手术，然后立刻释放你们所有人，让你们走出我的领地。不过，我能做的仅限于此。”

“你放了我们，我们不告发你，怎么样？”有人大声喊着说。

“你的这个提议没有诚意，”华盛顿面带嘲弄地说，“我的确将一个人放出来教我女儿意大利语，上个礼拜他逃跑了。”

二十多个人同时爆发出一阵疯狂的欢呼，接着出现了一个沸反盈天的欢庆场面。囚徒们跳起木屐舞、欢呼、用真假嗓音交换着唱约德尔调、摔跤，迸发出勃勃生机。他们甚至用尽全力冲上玻璃坑壁，再把自己的身体当作天然的肉垫子，滑回坑底。高个子开始唱歌，众人齐声附和——

我们要把皇帝吊死

在酸苹果树上——

布拉道克·华盛顿坐在那里，一言不发，显得神秘莫测，直到歌声停止。

“你们明白，”当他稍微能够引起这些人的一点点注意的时候，他才说道，“我对你们没有恶意。我喜欢看到你们自得其乐。这就是我没有马上把整个故事告诉你们的原因。那个人——他叫什么名字来着？科里奇迪切罗？——被我的代理人在十四个不同的地方枪毙了。”

他们没有料到刚才提到的地方都是城市，欢闹声立刻停止了。

“尽管他死了，”华盛顿突然暴跳如雷，“可他当初竟然企图逃跑。有了这样的教训，你们还指望我拿你们中的任何人来冒险吗？”

下面再次爆发出一阵阵欢呼声。

“当然！”

“你女儿想学汉语吗？”

“喂，我会说意大利语，我母亲是意大利人。”

“也许她想学纽约话！”

“如果她就是那个长着蓝色的大眼睛的小美人，我可以教给她许多比意大利语更好的东西。”

“我会唱爱尔兰歌——而且，我还会演奏铜管乐器。”

华盛顿先生突然伸出手杖，戳了一下草地上的按钮，下面的画面一下子就消失了，只留下那个巨大的黑窟窿，被铁网的黑牙阴郁地覆盖着。

“嗨！”从地下传来一个人的叫声，“你还没有祝福我们就准备一走了之了吗？”

但是华盛顿先生已经迈着悠闲的步子向高尔夫球场的第九个球洞走去，他的身后跟着两个男孩子。仿佛那个坑和坑里的一切只不过是高尔夫球场上的一道障碍，而他轻轻地挥一下灵巧的球棒，就取得了胜利。

在钻石山的守护下，七月的夜晚需要躲进毛毯里，白天却温暖而明亮。约翰和吉斯敏坠入了爱河。他不知道，他送给她的那枚小小的金橄榄球（上面刻着“为了上帝、祖国和圣米达”的铭文）已经挂在她的白金项链上，躺在她的胸口上了。不过，那枚金球却知道。而她也不知道，有一天，从她那朴素的头饰上掉下来的一大块蓝宝石已经被约翰温柔地保存在他的珠宝盒里了。

一天午后，当那间用红宝石和白貂皮装饰的音乐房安静下来的时候，他们一起在里面待了一个小时。他握着她的手，她含情脉脉地看了他一眼，他便忘乎所以地悄悄呼唤了一声她的名字。她朝他靠过去——然后又犹豫起来。

“你刚才叫我‘吉斯敏’了，是吗？”她温柔地问，“或者——”

她想求证一下，因为她觉得她可能是听错了。

他们俩以前谁都没有接过吻，一个小时的相处虽然短暂，似乎也不妨碍什么。

午后的时光悄然而逝。晚上，当最后一阵音乐从最高的塔楼里游丝一般地飘下来的时候，两个人睁着眼睛，各自躺着，幸福地回味着白天度过的分分秒秒。他们决定尽快结婚。





八


华盛顿先生和两个男孩子每天都去森林深处打猎或钓鱼，或者在让人昏昏欲睡的高尔夫球场上打高尔夫球——比赛的时候，出于一种外交策略，约翰总是让主人赢——或者在山间清凉的湖水中游泳。约翰发现华盛顿先生的性格有点严苛——他对除了自己以外的任何人的观点都完全不感兴趣。无论什么时候，华盛顿太太都高高在上，不苟言笑。很显然，她对两个女儿漠不关心，而把全部精力都放在儿子珀西身上，吃饭的时候，她用西班牙语开机关枪似的和儿子聊个没完没了。

大女儿佳斯敏和吉斯敏长得很像——只是她有点罗圈腿，而且手脚都很大。然而，她的气质却完全不能和妹妹相提并论。她最喜欢看穷人家的女儿为鳏居的父亲料理家务之类的书。约翰从吉斯敏那里了解到，正当佳斯敏准备动身前往欧洲专门负责行军伙食的时候，世界大战结束了，这使她大为震惊和失望，从此再也没有从这种状态中走出来。有一阵子，她甚至非常憔悴，布拉道克·华盛顿想办法在巴尔干地区重新发动了一场战争——但是，她看到一张塞尔维亚伤兵的照片，便对战争失去了兴趣。不过，珀西和吉斯敏似乎遗传了他们父亲的所有刻薄的秉性中目空一切的态度。他们的每一个想法都一成不变地透着毫不掩饰、始终如一的自私自利。

约翰陶醉在城堡和山谷的奇观之中。珀西告诉他，布拉道克·华盛顿派人绑架了一名景观园艺师、一名建筑师、一名舞台背景设计师和一名上世纪遗留下来的法国颓废派诗人。他允许他们随意使唤所有的黑人奴隶，保证给他们供应世界上能找到的任何材料，让他们将他们自己的想法付诸实施。然而，他们一个接一个地证明自己是废物。那位颓废派诗人马上开始哭诉他与春天的林荫大道无缘相见了——他弄出一大堆模棱两可的辞藻，什么香料啦，类人猿啦，象牙啦，却没有任何实际价值。那位舞台背景设计师一厢情愿地要用整个山谷来展现他的专业技巧，并要让它产生轰动效应——华盛顿一家很快就厌倦了这套东西。至于那位建筑师和那个景观园艺师，他们的脑子里全是些老掉牙的东西，他们只能弄出些依样画葫芦的玩意儿。

然而，他们至少解决了一个问题，就是如何葬送他们自己——一天晚上，他们待在一个房间里，想就一口喷泉的选址问题达成一致意见，他们整整熬了一个通宵，第二天清早全都疯了。现在，他们被舒舒服服地关在康涅狄格州的韦斯特波特疯人院里。

“可是，”约翰好奇地问，“你们那些奇妙的会客室、厅堂、通道和浴室是谁设计的——？”

“哦，”珀西回答说，“说来惭愧，是一个电影制片人设计的。他是我们找到的唯一人选，他花钱如流水，尽管他把餐巾塞进领子里，不会读书，也不会写字。”

八月即将结束，约翰开始为不得不返回学校而感到遗憾。他和吉斯敏决定明年六月一起私奔。

“在这儿结婚比较好，”吉斯敏承认，“不过，当然，父亲是永远也不会同意我嫁给你的。既然如此，我宁愿私奔。现如今，有钱人在美国结婚非常可怕——他们一定要让媒体发表公告，说什么他们结婚时要秉承节俭的遗风，他们的意思是，他们只有一堆别人戴过的旧珍珠和一些欧仁妮女皇穿过的旧蕾丝。”

“我知道，”约翰心有戚戚焉地说，“我去施内策——墨菲家做客的时候，他的大女儿格温朵琳嫁给了一个人，这个人的父亲拥有弗吉尼亚的半壁江山。她在家书上说，她靠丈夫作为银行职员的那点工资艰难度日，苦苦挣扎——然后，在信的结尾处，她说：‘感谢上帝，幸好我有四个能干的女仆，日子还算好过点。’”

“可笑，”吉斯敏说，“想想世界上千千万万的人，劳动者和其他所有人，他们只有两个女仆，日子也过得好好的。”

八月末的一个下午，吉斯敏的一句无心之语改变了整个局势的情态，将约翰置于极度惶恐之中。

他们待在最喜爱的小树林里，一旦停止接吻，约翰就会想入非非，对他们的浪漫爱情有种不祥的预感。这种感觉在他的心头徘徊不去，为他们的关系增添了几分心酸。

“有时候我想，我们永远都结不了婚，”他伤感地说，“你太富有，太高贵。像你这样富贵的姑娘和其他女孩都不相同。我应该和一个奥马哈或者苏城某个富裕的五金批发商的女儿结婚，她有五十万元财产我就知足了。”

“我曾经认识一个五金批发商的女儿，”吉斯敏说，“我觉得你看不上她。她是我姐姐的朋友，到这儿来玩儿过。”

“哦，这么说，你们这里还来过别的客人？”约翰吃惊地说。

吉斯敏似乎后悔说了这句话。

“哦，是的，”她慌慌张张地说，“我们有几个客人。”

“可是，难道你们——你父亲不怕他们到外面去说什么吗？”

“哦，从某种程度上来说，多少有点，”她答道，“我们说点愉快的事吧。”

然而，这勾起了约翰的好奇心。

“愉快的事！”他咄咄逼人地说，“难道有什么不愉快的事吗？难道她们不是好姑娘吗？”

令他十分吃惊的是，吉斯敏哭了起来。

“她们都是好姑娘——可——可麻烦也在这里。她们中有几个我非常喜欢，佳斯敏也一样。可是，尽管如此，她还是不停地邀——邀请她们到这里来。我无法理解。”

约翰的心中生出不祥的疑团。

“你的意思是，她们说出去了，你父亲把她们——赶走了？”

“比这更糟，”她语不连贯、嘟嘟哝哝地说，“父亲从不冒险——而佳斯敏又执意写信邀请她们来，她们也玩得非常开心！”

她突然感到一阵悲伤。

这可怕的事实使约翰大为震惊，他目瞪口呆地坐在那里，感到浑身的神经在鸣响，好像脊柱里停了无数只麻雀一样。

“现在，我告诉你了，可是我不该这么做的。”她突然平静下来，擦干了她深蓝色的眼睛。

“你的意思是说，你父亲在她们离开之前就把她们谋杀了？”

她点点头。

“通常在八月——或者九月初。对我们来说，一开始从她们身上得到极大的快乐是自然而然的事情。”

“太可恶了！太——哦，我准是要发疯了！你刚才果真承认——”

“没错，”吉斯敏耸耸肩，打断了他的话，“我们不能将她们像那些每天都对我们责骂不休的飞行员一样严严实实地关起来。杀了她们总会让我和佳斯敏心里好受一点，因为父亲动手的时间比我们想象的要早，那样的话，就不会有永别的悲伤场面了——”

“你们就这样杀了她们！天哪！”约翰叫道。

“事情干得很漂亮。趁她们睡着的时候，把她们毒死——总是有人告诉她们的家人，说她们在比优特死于猩红热。”

“但是——我不能理解，你们为什么还要不停地邀请她们！”

“我没有，”吉斯敏急得大叫起来，“我从来都没有邀请过一个人，是佳斯敏邀请的。她们一直都玩得非常开心。她一直送给她们最好的礼物，直到最后。没准我也会邀请客人来——我也会狠起心来这么做的。死亡是不可避免的，我们不能让它妨碍我们拥有快乐的生活。想想看，如果我们没有一个人陪伴，那我们在这里该有多么孤独。哦，父亲和母亲和我们一样，也牺牲了一些最好的朋友。”

“因此，”约翰恶狠狠地吼道，“因此，你让我爱上你，你假装也爱我，装模作样地和我谈婚论嫁，而你自始至终都清清楚楚地知道，我永远都无法活着离开这里——”

“不，”她激动地表示反对，“刚开始的时候是这样的，可是现在我已经改变想法了。你已经来了，我无能为力，我本来以为，在你最后的日子里，我们俩不妨快活一下。可是，然后，我就爱上你了，而且——而且，我真的觉得很难过，你就要——就要被处死——尽管我宁愿你被处死，也不愿你去亲吻别的女孩。”

“哦，你愿意，你愿意吗？”约翰暴躁地说。

“非常愿意。另外，我常听说，一个女孩和一个她明知永远不能嫁给他的男人在一起会更开心。哦，我为什么要告诉你这些？我现在可能已经把你所拥有的所有快乐时光都破坏了，在你不知情的时候，我们玩得真是开心极了。我就知道，你要是了解了事情的真相，准会有点难过的。”

“哼，你知道，是吗？”约翰气急败坏地颤抖着说，“我已经听够了。如果你不顾尊严和体面，要和一个差不多就要变成尸体的家伙谈情说爱的话，我可不想再和你有任何关系了！”

“你不是尸体！”她恐惧地表示反对，“你不是尸体！我不允许你说我和尸体接吻！”

“我可没说那种话！”

“你说了！你说我和尸体接吻了！”

“我没说！”

他们提高了嗓门，但是突然意识到有人来，便马上默不作声了。脚步声沿着那条小径朝他们这边传过来。过了一会儿，玫瑰花丛被人扒开，布拉道克·华盛顿出现在他们面前，在他那英俊而空虚的脸上，一双锐利的眼睛正紧紧地盯着他们。

“谁和尸体接吻了？”他问。显然，他对这个说法很反感。

“没人这么说，”吉斯敏赶忙回答，“我们只是在开玩笑。”

“你们到底在这里干什么？”他口气粗暴地问，“吉斯敏，你应该——应该去看书，或者，和你姐姐打高尔夫球去。看书去！打高尔夫球去！我回来的时候，别让我再在这个地方看到你！”

然后，他向约翰鞠了个躬，沿着小径走开了。

“看见了吧？”等父亲的脚步声听不见了，吉斯敏生气地说，“你把事情搞砸了。我们再也不能见面了。他不会让我见你了。如果他知道我们在谈恋爱，会把你毒死的。”

“我们没有谈恋爱，不可能再谈恋爱了！”约翰穷凶极恶地说，“因此，他尽管放心好了。而且，你别再自欺欺人了，别以为我还会在这里继续待下去。最多需要六个小时，我就能翻过这些大山，哪怕我得用嘴巴啃出一条通道来，我也会踏上回东部的路。”

他们两个人都站了起来，听到这些话，吉斯敏走到他身边，挽起他的胳膊。

“我也要去。”

“你一定是疯了——”

“我当然要去。”她生气地打断了他的话。

“你肯定不能去，你——”

“很好，”她平静地说，“我们现在就追上父亲，和他摊牌。”

约翰拗不过她，挤出了一丝苦笑。

“好吧，最最亲爱的，”他无力地敷衍了一声，算是同意了，“我们一起走。”

他对她的爱又回来了，他对她的爱已经静静地驻扎在他的心头了。她是他的了——她要和他一起走，要和他患难与共。他拥抱着她，激动地亲吻她。毕竟她爱他；事实上，是她救了他。

他们一边商量着出走的事，一边慢慢地回到城堡里。他们决定，既然布拉道克·华盛顿已经看到他们在一起了，他们最好第二天夜里就离开。尽管如此，吃晚饭的时候，约翰的嘴唇干得要命，他还紧张地将一大勺孔雀汤倒进了左肺，不得不被人抬进绿松石和紫貂皮装饰的棋牌室里，让一个男管家给他拍背。珀西觉得这件事非常好笑。

后半夜，约翰的身体紧张地抽搐了一下，突然直挺挺地坐起来，盯着房间里令人昏昏欲睡的纱幔。他隐隐约约地听见一个声音透过几个蓝墨色的方块，即房间里开着的几扇窗户，从远处传来，这个声音一到床边便随风而散。他迷迷糊糊的，似乎还在做着可怕的梦，因而无法做出判断。但是，紧接着，从较近的地方——就在房间外面，传来一个刺耳的声音——是转动门把手的声音、脚步声，还是有人在窃窃私语，他也无法做出判断；他紧张地听着，此时此刻他备受煎熬，浑身疼痛，胃部堵了一块硬邦邦的东西。然后，有一幅纱幔似乎飘散了，他看见一个模糊的黑影站在门口，黑影在黑暗中若隐若现，和纱幔的皱褶缠绕在一起，看起来有些变形，好像从一块脏兮兮的窗玻璃里看到的一个映象。

不知是突然感到了一阵恐惧，还是突然做出了什么决定，约翰按下床边的按钮。刹那间，他坐进了隔壁房间凹陷的绿色浴池里，被半池冷水猛然一激，彻底清醒了。

他从浴池里跳出来，湿淋淋的睡衣水星乱溅，身后水流如注。他朝那扇蓝色的水晶门跑去，他知道，这扇门通向二楼的象牙楼梯平台。门无声地打开了，一盏红色的灯在巨大的屋顶下燃烧着，将富丽堂皇、精雕细镂的楼梯照得格外美丽。周围一片寂静、一片辉煌，约翰犹豫了片刻，被眼前的景象吓得毛骨悚然。这个落汤鸡似的、孤独而渺小的身影在象牙楼梯平台上瑟瑟发抖，仿佛被眼前巨大的空间和明暗交错的光影吞没。接着同时发生了两件事：他住的那间起居室的转门打开了，三个一丝不挂的黑人突然出现在大厅里——当约翰惊恐万状、蹒跚着冲向楼梯的时候，另一扇门滑进走廊另一面的墙壁里，约翰看见布拉道克·华盛顿站在明亮的电梯里，穿着一件裘皮大衣和一双及膝的长筒马靴，马靴上面露出一截鲜艳的玫瑰色睡衣。冲向约翰的三个黑人——约翰之前从来没有见过他们中的任何一个，他的脑海里闪过一个念头，他们一定是职业杀手——立刻停住了脚步，期待地转身望着电梯里的那个人。那人大喝一声，专横地命令道：

“进来！你们三个！马上进来！”

然后，眨眼间，三个黑人倏地钻进笼子一般的电梯。电梯门滑动着关上了，那个像灯笼一般明亮的长方形电梯看不见了，大厅里又剩下约翰孤单单的一个人了。他虚弱无力地一下子瘫倒在象牙楼梯上。

显然发生了什么严重的事情，这件事至少暂时推迟了他自己微不足道的灾难。是什么事情呢？是黑人们奋起反抗了吗？是那些飞行员将铁网冲破了吗？或者，是费西村的人贸然闯进山中，用他们那黯淡又凄楚的眼神窥见了这个华丽的山谷吗？约翰不得而知。当电梯再次飙升、继而又降落下去的时候，他听到电梯运行时所带动的一阵阵风声。可能是珀西急匆匆地赶去给父亲帮忙。约翰灵机一动，觉得他正可以趁此机会去找吉斯敏计划马上出逃的事情。他等待着，直到几分钟后电梯安静下来。夜晚的寒意透过他那湿淋淋的睡衣，像鞭子一样一阵阵地袭来，他微微颤抖着，回到自己的房间，迅速穿好衣服。然后，爬上长长的楼梯，拐进铺着俄国紫貂皮的走廊里，朝吉斯敏的套房走去。

她的起居室的门敞开着，灯也都开着。吉斯敏穿着一件安哥拉山羊皮和服式晨衣，站在窗户边，在倾听什么。当约翰蹑手蹑脚地进来时，她转过身看着他。

“哦，是你！”她一边小声说，一边穿过房间向他走来，“你听到他们的声音了吗？”

“我听见你父亲的奴隶在我的——”

“不，”她激动地打断他的话，“我说的是飞机的声音。”

“飞机？可能就是飞机的声音把我吵醒了。”

“至少有十二架。刚才，我就清清楚楚地看见一架飞机在月光下飞呢。山崖后面那个警卫举起步枪射击，他的枪声惊醒了父亲。我们马上就要和他们交火了。”

“他们是故意到这儿来的吗？”

“是的——是那个逃跑的意大利人——”

话音未落，一阵刺耳的噼里啪啦的声音从敞开的窗口传进来。吉斯敏小声叫了一声，从化妆台上的一个盒子里摸了一枚硬币，朝一盏电灯奔去。刹那间，整个城堡陷入黑暗之中——她切断了保险丝。

“快走！”她朝他喊道，“我们到屋顶花园上去，从那里观看！”

她披了一件斗篷，拉起他的手，一起走到门口，离塔楼的电梯只有一步之遥。她按下按钮，电梯立刻像火箭一般将他们射入高空。黑暗中，他将她拥入怀中，亲吻她的双唇。约翰·昂格尔终于交上了桃花运。一分钟后，他们走出电梯，来到星光如水的平台上。天空中，朦胧的月亮在一片片随意翻卷的云彩之间钻来钻去，月亮下面，十二架飞机驾着黑色的翅膀，不停地盘旋着。山谷中一团团火焰从各个地方喷向飞机，并伴随着刺耳的爆炸声。吉斯敏开心地鼓起掌来。然而，过了一会儿，她又害怕起来，因为按照事先做好的部署，飞机开始投放炸弹，整个山谷变成了一幅隆隆回响、火光冲天的全景图。

不久，攻击的飞机开始将目标集中在安装高射炮的区域，一架高射炮几乎瞬间便化作一大堆黑炭，冒着烟倒在玫瑰花园里。

“吉斯敏，”约翰恳求道，“要是你知道，这次进攻发生在我被谋杀的前夜，你会很高兴的。如果我没有听见后面要塞处那个警卫开枪的声音，我现在恐怕已经是一具僵尸了——”

“我听不见，”吉斯敏大声喊，她正全神贯注于眼前的情景，“你得大声点！”

“我只是说，”约翰大声说，“趁他们还没来得及轰炸城堡，我们最好赶快离开。”

突然，黑人居住区的所有门廊都噼里啪啦地化为碎片，从石廊下面腾起一团火焰，将大理石炸成巨大的、不规则的碎片，纷纷飞向湖边。

“那儿有‘价值五万元’的奴隶呢，”吉斯敏叫道，“是战前的价格呢，根本没几个美国人尊重私人财产。”

约翰再次做出努力，催她离开。飞机的攻击目标分分秒秒都在变得更加精准，而且只剩下两架高射炮在反击了。显然，守卫队已经被炮火团团围困，已经撑不了多久了。

“快点！”约翰扯着吉斯敏的胳膊，大声叫道，“我们必须离开。难道你还不知道，那些飞行员如果发现你，会毫不留情地杀了你？”

她勉强同意了。

“我们得叫醒佳斯敏！”他们慌慌张张地走向电梯时，她说。然后，她天真快乐地说：“我们会很穷，是吗？就像书中的人物一样。我将成为孤儿，完全自由自在。自由而贫穷！多有趣啊！”她停下脚步，嘟起嘴唇，开心地吻了他一下。

“两者不可兼而有之，”约翰一本正经地说，“人们明白这个道理。如果可以在两者中任选其一，我宁愿选择自由。为了万无一失，你最好将珠宝盒里的东西装到口袋里。”

十分钟后，两个女孩在漆黑的走廊里与约翰会合，他们下楼来到城堡的底层，最后一次穿过金碧辉煌的豪华厅堂，在外面的露台上站了一会儿，看着熊熊燃烧的黑人居住区和落在湖对岸燃着余烬的两架飞机残骸。只剩一架高射炮还在突突射击，继续顽强抵抗，攻击的飞机似乎不敢冲下来，只在它的四周投射电闪雷鸣般的炸弹，直到哪颗炮弹碰巧命中目标，将黑人射击手炸死为止。

约翰和两姐妹下了大理石台阶，突然转到左边的一条羊肠小道上，小道像一条吊袜带似的绕着钻石山蜿蜒而下。吉斯敏知道，半山腰有一片密林，他们可以在那里藏身，还可以观察夜晚山谷中的疯狂景象——最后，必要的话，还可以沿着这条置于溪谷乱石中的秘密小道逃生。





十


他们到达目的地的时候已经凌晨三点钟了。娴静沉着的佳斯敏立刻靠着一棵大树干睡着了。约翰搂着吉斯敏坐下来，眺望着山谷中的景象：前一天早上还是花园的地方如今已经成为一片废墟，那里还在令人绝望地进行着拉锯战，不过看样子战斗即将结束了。刚过四点钟，最后的那架高射炮在一阵迅速升腾起的红色烟雾中轰然倒塌，失去了战斗力。虽然月亮已经西沉，但是他们依然能够看见那些飞机在离地面更近的地方盘旋。这些飞机一旦确定被围困者再也没有能力反抗，就会降落到地面上，届时，华盛顿家族黑暗而光辉的统治也就宣告结束了。

停火之后，山谷里一片沉寂。两架飞机的残骸像趴在草丛里的怪兽的眼睛，闪着可怕的火光。城堡静静地立在黑暗中，虽然没有光，但它像在阳光中一样优雅标致。树林沙沙作响，似乎在进行公证的判决，空气中充斥着此起彼伏的哭诉声。这时，约翰发现，吉斯敏和她姐姐一样进入了甜蜜的梦乡。

四五点钟的时候，他听到他们刚刚走过的那条小道上有脚步声，他屏住呼吸，静静地等待着，他看见一拨属于钻石山一方的人从他们所在的有利地点经过。现在，空气里隐约有点天籁之声了，露水很凉，他知道天很快就要亮了。约翰等待着，直到那拨人走得远远地上了山，脚步声消失了，他觉得安全了，才跟踪过去。大约在陡峭的半山腰处，树木倒向一边，一大块马鞍一样的岩石遮在下面的钻石上。快走到这个地方的时候，他放慢了脚步，本能地感觉到前面有人。他走到一块椭圆形的大石头后面，慢慢地伸出头，他的好奇心得到了满足。他看到了如下的情景：

布拉道克·华盛顿悄然无声、毫无生气地站在那里一动不动，苍茫的天空映出他的身影。东方渐白，给大地蒙上一层清冷的绿色，使这个形单影只的人与新的一天形成微不足道的反差。

约翰观察着的时候，有一会儿，他的东道主在沉思冥想，显得神秘莫测。接着，他朝两个蹲在他脚边的黑人发出指令，让他们抬起横在他们中间的东西。当他们吃力地站起来的时候，第一缕金色的阳光立刻照在一颗精雕细琢的巨钻的无数个钻面上，巨钻立刻释放出一道道银色的光芒，像启明星的碎片一般在空中熠熠放光。两个黑人抬着钻石，打了几个趔趄——然后，他们身上的一块块肌肉在汗津津的皮肤下面绷得紧紧的。然而，三个人面对上苍，回天无力，又站着不动了。

过了一会儿，那个白人抬起头，慢慢地举起两只胳膊，摆出让人安静的姿势，好像要面对广大观众演讲一样——不过，没有广大观众，只有茫茫的大山和沉寂的天空，只有林中的小鸟发出微弱的叫声，来打破这天地的寂静。站在石鞍上的那个人以不容置喙的傲慢姿态有板有眼地开腔说话了。

“上边的，听着——”他声音颤抖地大声说，“你——听着——！”他不说了，依然举着胳膊，神情专注地抬着头，仿佛在等待回应。约翰睁大眼睛，想看看是否有人从山上下来，可是，山上空无一人，只有苍茫的天空和从树梢上吹来的嘲笑的笛声。华盛顿是在祈祷吗？约翰好奇地想了一会儿。接着，他就不再这么想了——这个人所有的言谈举止都和祈祷大相径庭。

“喂，上边的，你听着！”

他的声音很强硬，很自信，根本不是在哀求。要说有那么一点“求”的意思的话，那也是一种狂傲的屈尊。

“你，听着——”

他叽叽呱呱地说了一大通，根本无法听懂……约翰屏着呼吸仔细倾听，偶尔听懂一两个字。他的声音时断时续——一会儿强硬，像是在吵架；一会儿低沉困惑，怒气冲冲。然后，这唯一的听众开始明白是怎么回事了，他顿时觉得血脉偾张。布拉道克·华盛顿在贿赂上帝！

就是这么回事——毫无疑问。他的奴隶抬着的钻石只是预付的样品，他许诺以后会源源不断地供应。

过了很久，约翰才明白，这就是贯穿于他那一大堆话里的线索。大富大贵的普罗米修斯正在见证绝对在耶稣降生之前就被人们遗忘了的牺牲、祭拜仪式和祈祷。有一会儿，他提醒上帝，不要忘记自己曾经半推半就地从人类那里接受过的这样那样的礼物——上帝将城市从瘟疫之中救出时，人类为他建造的大教堂；人类因为贪欲和杀戮而犯下滔天罪行，为了祈求上帝平息、缓和怒气而将没药和黄金、人类的生命、美丽的女人、俘获的军队、孩子、王后、森林和田野里的野兽、绵羊和山羊、粮食蔬菜、城池以及征服的所有土地都献给了上帝——而现在，他，布拉道克·华盛顿，钻石皇帝、黄金时代的国王和牧师、享尽奢华的独裁者，愿意奉献的财宝就连以前的君王们都从来不敢奢望，他不是在哀求而是在骄傲地奉献这些财宝。

他继续祈祷，开始论及具体事宜。他愿意把这颗世界上最大的钻石献给上帝，这颗钻石可以切出比树上的叶子还要多出不知多少的钻面，而整颗钻石则可以雕刻得和蝇子一样大小的钻石一样精美无暇。不计其数的人将长年累月地为这颗钻石耗尽心血。它可以镶嵌在雄伟的、贴着金箔且雕饰华美的教堂圆顶上，再用蛋白石和古老的蓝宝石装饰教堂的大门。中间再建一个私人祈祷室，上面再用彩虹色的、能腐蚀一切的、永远变幻不定的镭石建造一个祭坛。祈祷的人只要在祈祷的时候胆敢抬头看一眼，他的眼睛立刻就会被烧坏——而且，为了能让神圣的救世主开心，在这个祭坛上，可以宰杀上帝所选中的任何一个牺牲品，哪怕他是拥有至高无上的权力的、最伟大的活人。

作为交换，他只有一个小小的要求，这对上帝而言，简直不费吹灰之力——只要将目前的一切恢复如初，直到永远。这非常简单！只要将天庭打开，把那些人和飞机吞没——然后再关上天庭的门就万事大吉了。让他重新拥有奴隶，恢复原来的生活和财富。

除了上帝，他不需要酬劳任何人，也不需要和任何人讨价还价。

他只怀疑他贿赂的东西是否够分量。上帝当然有他的价格标准。上帝以人的形象创造而来，人们如是说：他一定有他的代价（价格）(8)。而且这个价格一定非常昂贵——绝不是长年累月才建成的教堂，也绝不是上万工人建成的金字塔，而是他今天许诺给上帝的这座教堂和这座金字塔。

他停下来不说了，那便是他的建议。他声称，一切都会按照高标准办理，绝对货真价实，绝不会有任何流俗之处。他的言外之意是说，上帝是接受还是拒绝，悉听尊便。

快要说完的时候，他开始语不连贯，他的话既简短又迟疑，他似乎浑身紧张，似乎要用尽所有力气抓住周围空间里的空气和最细微的声音。说着说着，他的头发变白了。现在，他对着天庭，高高地昂着头，像古代的先知，疯狂之态无与伦比。

然后，正当约翰出神地看着这一切的时候，他仿佛感到一种奇怪的现象在他周围的某个地方发生了。天空仿佛在顷刻之间黯淡下来，一阵阵的风声中似乎夹杂着低沉的呼啸，远处有喇叭的声音，还有一声叹息，犹如宽松柔软的睡袍发出的窸窸窣窣的声音——一时之间，天昏地暗；鸟儿不再歌唱；树木也停止了摇动，远山传出沉闷、骇人的隆隆声。

一切都结束了。风躲进山谷里的深草丛中休息去了。黎明和白天很快又找准了自己的位置，初升的太阳释放出朦胧的黄色热浪，照亮了前方的道路。树叶在阳光下欢笑，树木和着笑声跳舞，枝条摇摆得像众仙女柔软飘逸的腰肢。上帝拒绝接受贿赂。

约翰又欣赏了一会儿白天取得的胜利，然后，他转过身，看见湖边相继飘落了一个个褐色的物体，好像从云彩里飘然而下的金色天使在跳舞。飞机已经着陆了。

约翰从大石头上滑下来，跑到山坡下的那片树林里，两个姑娘已经醒了，正在等他。吉斯敏跳起来，口袋里的珠宝发出叮叮当当的响声，她张开嘴，想要问什么，然而，本能告诉约翰，没有说话的时间了。他们必须立刻下山，一秒钟都不能耽搁。他分别抓住她们的一只手，悄悄地在树林中穿行，现在他们沐浴在阳光和山岚中。他们身后的山谷悄无声息，只有远处传来的孔雀的叫声和清晨欢乐的气息。

他们走了大约半英里，避开公园，踏上一条狭窄的小径，朝下一个山头走去。他们爬到山顶，停下脚步，回头张望。他们的目光落在刚刚离开的山坡上——那里感觉不妙，一场悲剧即将上演。

天空清晰地衬托出一个落魄的白发男人，他正慢慢地顺着陡峭的山坡往下走，身后跟着两个体格庞大、面无表情的黑人，他们抬着那颗在阳光下依然华光四射的巨钻。走到半山腰处，另外有两个人同他们会合——约翰看得出来，他们是华盛顿太太和搀扶着她的儿子。几个飞行员已经从飞机上下来，走到城堡前面一览无余的草坪上了。他们手里握着步枪，开始以小规模战斗的队形朝钻石山上攀登。

但是，那五个人的小队已经遥遥领先，而且吸引了所有观察者们的注意。他们在一块突出的岩石边停下脚步。黑人弓着腰，推开一扇像是装在山坡上的活板门。他们都进到里面，看不见了。白发男人先进去，接着是他的妻儿，最后是两个黑人。在活板门落下将他们吞没之前的那一刻，他们头饰上的钻石棱角在阳光的照射下发出璀璨的光芒。

吉斯敏紧紧抓着约翰的胳膊。

“哦，”她疯狂地叫道，“他们要去哪里？他们要干什么？”

“那肯定是一条可以逃生的地道——”

两个女孩的轻声尖叫打断了约翰的话。

“你没看见吗？”吉斯敏号啕大哭，“山上布了电线！”

听到她的话，约翰抬起两只手遮住刺目的阳光。只见整个山体表面突然燃烧起炫目的黄色火光，这些光是从草皮下面射出来的，好像是从指缝里漏出来的一样。这令人难以忍受的光继续燃烧了一会儿，然后像熄灭了的灯丝一样，消失了，留下一片黑色的垃圾，慢慢地冒着蓝烟，夺去了山上残留的植被和血肉之躯的生命。飞行员们连一滴血、一根骨头都没有留下——他们连同那进入山中的五个人的灵魂一样，彻底地不复存在了。

与此同时，随着一阵地动山摇，整个城堡飞入空中，被炸成无数燃烧的碎片，再跌回烟雾弥漫的废墟里，一半落入湖水中。没有火——只有那和阳光交织在一起的烟雾，缭绕着飘散了，从那曾经是珠宝堆砌的华屋豪舍而今却成为一大堆平淡无奇的废墟里腾起的大理石粉尘整整弥漫了几分钟之久。万籁俱寂，只剩下他们三个人孤独地待在这偌大的山谷中。





十一


夕阳西下，约翰和他的两个同伴来到那座高高的山崖上，这里曾经是华盛顿王国的边界，他们回头望去，发现黄昏的山谷安静而美丽。他们坐下来，把佳斯敏带的一篮子食物吃得干干净净。

“瞧，”她铺开桌布，将三明治整整齐齐地摆在上面说，“不是很诱人吗？我常常想，在野外吃东西会更香。”

“说出这句话，”吉斯敏说，“说明佳斯敏步入中产阶级了。”

“现在，”约翰急不可待地说，“翻开你们的口袋，看看你们都带了什么宝贝儿。如果你们的品味够好，那么，我们三个人应该可以舒舒服服地度过余生了。”

吉斯敏顺从地将手放进口袋，将两捧闪闪发光的宝石放到他面前。

“还不错，”约翰充满热情地叫道，“不是很大，不过——嗨！”他拿起一颗宝石对着夕阳余晖看了看，脸色立即大变。

“哎，这些都不是钻石！有点不对劲儿啊！”

“天哪！”吉斯敏一脸诧异地叫道，“我真傻！”

“哎，这些都是莱茵石！”约翰叫道。

“我知道。”她突然大声笑起来，“我开错抽屉了。这些石头原本是来拜访佳斯敏的一个女孩缀在裙子上的，我用钻石和她做了交换。以前，除了珍贵的钻石，别的什么我都没有见过。”

“这就是你带的东西吗？”

“恐怕是这样。”她愁眉不展地用手指抚弄着这些宝石，“我想，我更喜欢这些东西，我有点讨厌钻石了。”

“很好，”约翰心情沉重地说，“我们不得不生活在哈德斯了。你会一边对那些满腹狐疑的女人们说你开错抽屉了，一边渐渐地老去。不幸的是，你父亲的银行簿和他同归于尽了。”

“呃，哈德斯有什么问题吗？”

“要是我这么个年纪就带个老婆回家，我父亲肯定不会拿块热炭阻止我，就像南方人常说的那样。”

佳斯敏开口说话了。

“我喜欢洗衣服，”她平静地说，“我总是自己洗手帕。我去找份洗衣服的活，养活你们俩。”

“哈德斯有洗衣服的女工吗？”吉斯敏天真地问。

“当然有，”约翰回答说，“和别的地方一样。”

“我原来以为——也许，天太热了，人们就不用穿衣服。”

约翰哈哈大笑。

“你就试试看吧！”他提议道，“你脱到一半，人们就会把你赶出去。”

“父亲会去吗？”她问道。

约翰大吃一惊，转身看着她。

“你父亲已经死了，”他脸色凝重地说，“为什么他要去哈德斯？你把哈德斯当成另一个地方了，而那个地方早就不复存在了。”

吃完饭，他们收起桌布，铺上毛毯，准备睡觉。

“我们刚刚经历了一场多么可怕的梦啊！”吉斯敏仰望星空，叹了一口气说，“而且现在，和一个身无分文、只有一套衣服的未婚夫一起待在这个地方，看起来也非常奇怪。”

“在星星下面，”她继续说，“我以前从未意识到这些是星星，我一直以为它们是属于某个人的大钻石。现在，它们让我感到恐惧，它们让我觉得，过去的一切都只是一场梦，而我在那个梦里耗尽了我的青春。”

“那的确是一场梦，”约翰平静地说，“每个人的青春都是一场梦，是一种化学物质的疯狂形态。”

“那么，发疯一定非常快活！”

“人们都这么说，”约翰闷闷不乐地说，“我弄不懂了。无论如何，让我们，你和我，相爱一段时间吧，比如说一年左右的时间。那是一种神圣的迷幻药，我们谁都可以尝试。整个世界只有钻石，钻石，或许可以说是让幻想破灭的卑鄙礼物。哦，我终于拥有钻石了，我以后对这俗不可耐的东西再也不会动心了。”他瑟瑟发抖，“把你的外套领子竖起来，小丫头，夜晚寒意袭人，你会患上肺炎的。最先创造意识的上帝真是犯下了弥天大罪。让我们抛开意识过上几个小时吧。”

于是，他将自己裹进毛毯，酣然睡去。

冬天的梦


一


一些高尔夫球童穷得要命，他们只能住在单间的房子里，前边的院子里还养一头无精打采的母牛。不过，德克斯特·格林的父亲却拥有黑熊镇上规模排在第二的大杂货店——“焦点”杂货店是最大的，是雪莉岛上的有钱人光顾的地方——而德克斯特做球童只能赚些零花钱。

秋天，当白天变得冷飕飕、阴沉沉的时候，漫长的冬天就像白色的盒盖子一样，“咔嗒”一声就把明尼苏达州关在里面了。高尔夫球场平坦的球道上积雪皑皑，德克斯特的滑雪板就在这里纵横驰骋。每当此时，他会为这片乡土感到深深的忧伤——漫长的冬季，这片海滨高尔夫球场一直都处于休耕期，上面落了些营养不良的麻雀，这样的情景让他感到很不愉快。发球区内死气沉沉，夏季的时候这里到处飘扬着色彩鲜艳的小旗帜，如今只剩下凄凉的沙箱埋在及膝的冰盖下。翻过山峦的时候，凛冽的寒风呼呼地吹在他的身上；太阳出来的时候，强烈的阳光毫无遮拦地刺得他睁不开眼睛，他就徒步在这里游游逛逛。

一到四月，冬天便戛然而止。冰雪消融，汩汩地流入黑熊湖，几乎等不及那些勇于挑战季节，拿着黑红相间的高尔夫球，早早到来的高尔夫球爱好者们。没有大张旗鼓，也没有一场声势浩大的降雨，寒冷就这样销声匿迹了。

德克斯特知道，北方的春天有点孤凄惨淡，正如他知道，这里的秋天却有点令人心花怒放。秋天让他紧握拳头，让他浑身颤抖，让他自言自语地重复着几句傻话，还会突然振臂高呼，对想象中的观众和部队下达命令。十月使他充满希望，十一月使他有点得意忘形，他想象着自己取得了令人欣喜若狂的辉煌成就。怀着这样的心情，夏天在雪莉岛上经历的那些稍纵即逝的精彩瞬间在他的脑海里酝酿发酵。在一次激烈的比赛中，在他想象中的平坦的高尔夫球道上，经过一百个回合，他击败了T. A.赫德里克先生，成为高尔夫球冠军。这场比赛的每一个细节，他都不知疲倦，拿捏有度，技法变换自如——有时，他不费吹灰之力就赢了一场比赛，轻松得简直可笑；有时，他出奇制胜，后来者居上。他再一次从“皮尔斯——银箭”牌汽车上走下来，像莫蒂默·琼斯先生那样，面无表情地迈着悠然自得的步子，走进雪莉岛高尔夫俱乐部的会客室里——或者，他没准会被一群崇拜者团团围住，在众人赞叹的目光中，从俱乐部充气码头的跳板上展示了一次花式跳水……在这些崇拜者中，有一个人一脸诧异、目瞪口呆地看着他，他就是莫蒂默·琼斯先生。

有一天，发生了一件事，琼斯先生——是他本人而不是他的幻影——眼泪汪汪地来到他面前，说德克斯特是——俱乐部里最优秀的球童，如果琼斯先生付给他足够的报酬，他是不是就决定不辞职了，因为俱乐部里其他所有的——球童都会让他在每个球洞里丢掉一个球——通常都会这样——

“不，先生，”德克斯特斩钉截铁地说，“我不想再做球童了。”他顿了一下接着说：“我年龄太大了。”

“你最多才十四岁。见鬼，你为什么偏偏在今天上午决定辞职？你不是还答应我下个礼拜要和我一起去参加锦标赛的州赛吗。”

“我还是觉得我年龄太大了。”

德克斯特交了他的“优秀”球童胸牌，领取了球童主管付给他的工资，便回了黑熊村的家。

“这个小子是我见过的——最好的球童，”那天下午，莫蒂默·琼斯先生喝酒的时候大声说，“从来没丢过一个球！勤快！聪明伶俐！不多嘴！安分！懂得感恩！”

事情缘于一个十一岁的小姑娘——作为小姑娘，她还是只丑小鸭，但实际上她可是只白天鹅。用不了几年，她就一定会漂亮得无以复加，给为数众多的男人带来没完没了的痛苦。然而现在，那白天鹅的影子已经清晰可见了。她浑身上下透出的气息总让人觉得她不够淑女，她微笑的时候，嘴唇自嘴角处向下弯成两道弧线。她的眼睛——天哪——简直是一潭热情激荡的秋水。这样的女人，她们从小就活力四射。现在她那单薄的身体里已经燃起一团火焰，这一点已经一目了然了。

上午九点钟，她就早早地来到高尔夫球场上，由一个身穿白色亚麻服的保姆陪同，保姆提着一个白色的帆布球袋，里面装着五根崭新的小高尔夫球棒。德克斯特第一眼看到她时，她就站在球童的房舍旁，显得无所适从，装模作样地与保姆聊天，想以此来掩饰她的紧张，并一惊一乍地做着不合时宜的鬼脸，想以此来显示她的优雅。

“哦，希尔达，今天天气真好。”德克斯特听她这么说。她的嘴角一动，嘴唇一弯，嫣然一笑，偷偷地朝四周看了一圈，眼神落在德克斯特身上，停留了片刻。

然后，她对保姆说：

“哦，我想，今天上午出来打球的人不是很多，是吧？”

她又笑了——笑得风情万种，却完全是装模作样——又是那么摄人心魄。

“现在，我不知道我们该怎么办了。”保姆说，她故意哪儿都不看。

“哦，没关系，我知道怎么办。”

德克斯特一动不动地站在那里，嘴巴半张着。他知道，如果他向前挪一步，他的目光就会与她的视线相遇——如果后退一步，他就无法完整地看到她的脸庞了。一时之间，他竟没有意识到她还这么小。现在，他想起来了，去年他曾经见过她几次——当时，她还穿着灯笼裤呢。

突然，他不由自主地笑出声来，笑声短促而唐突——他被自己的笑声吓了一跳，因此，他转过身，想赶紧走开。

“球童！”

德克斯特停住了脚步。

“球童——”

毫无疑问，这是在叫他。不仅如此，他还得到了那种难以名状的微笑，非同寻常的微笑——这样的微笑，至少能让一打男人到了中年还记忆犹新。

“球童，你知道高尔夫教练在哪儿吗？”

“他在上课。”

“哦，你知道球童主管在哪儿吗？”

“今天上午他还没来。”

“哦。”她一下子不知所措，用一只脚站着，左脚和右脚来回替换着。

“我们想找个球童，”保姆说，“莫蒂默·琼斯太太让我们出来打高尔夫球，可是，没有球童，我们不知道怎么打。”

琼斯小姐狠狠地白了她一眼，马上又恢复了原来的笑容，保姆知趣地打住了话头。

“这里除了我，就没有球童了，”德克斯特对保姆说，“主管来之前，我得待在这里值班。”

“哦。”

现在，琼斯小姐和她的随从走开了，与德克斯特保持着不远不近的距离，然后两个人开始叽叽咕咕地说起话来。说着说着，琼斯小姐抽出一根球棒，拼命地朝地上抽了一下，总结性地结束了谈话。她还不解气，再次举起球棒，准备朝保姆的胸脯抽去，保姆眼明手快地抓住球棒，来回拽了几下，把它从她的手中夺了过来。

“你这个该死的卑鄙龌龊的老东西！”琼斯小姐疯狂地大喊大叫。

接着，又一场争吵开始了。德克斯特觉得她们的争吵很好玩，有几次都忍不住笑起来，但是每一次还没等笑出声，他就忍住了。他情不自禁地产生了一个不可思议的想法，他觉得小姑娘打保姆是合情合理的。

球童主管的突然出现结束了这场风波，保姆立刻向他抱怨。

“琼斯小姐需要一个小球童，这个人说他去不了。”

“麦肯纳先生让我待在这里等你来。”德克斯特赶紧说。

“那么，他已经来了。”琼斯小姐对主管粲然一笑，撂下球袋，高傲地踏着莲花步，开始朝第一个发球区走去。

“呃？”球童主管转身对德克斯特说，“你还像个木头人似的站在那里做什么？去把那位年轻小姐的球棒捡起来。”

“我今天不想干活了。”德克斯特说。

“你不——”

“我想辞职。”

这个非同小可的决定把他自己也吓住了。他是最受青睐的球童，整个夏天，他每个月都能挣到三十美元，换到任何其他一个湖滨高尔夫球场他都不可能挣这么多。然而，他的情绪受到了强烈的打击，他得马上找到一个出口，将肚子里的烦心事一股脑地宣泄出去。

情况可没有这么简单。正如德克斯特后来常常遭遇的情况一样，他是在冥冥之中受到了冬日梦想的驱遣。





二


现在，当然，他当初那些冬日梦想的性质已经发生了变化，也和季节没什么关系了。然而，这些梦想给他的心灵带来的震撼以及所激发的他对美和财富的向往却永驻心田。几年后，这些梦想使德克斯特放弃了到州立大学攻读商学课程的机会，就读了东部的一所历史更悠久、更有知名度的学校。他父亲现在生意很红火，本来可以为他支付学费的，然而实际上，他却在上大学期间为囊中羞涩而苦恼，而且上这所学校并不见得有什么好处。不过，千万不要因为这个孩子的冬日梦想一开始就碰巧是一门心思地想当有钱人，就觉得他纯粹就是个势利眼。他并不贪婪，他并没有鱼与熊掌兼而有之的想法，并不是既想要纸醉金迷的物质生活，又想和地位显赫的人们交往——他只想过纸醉金迷的物质生活。他常常渴望最好的东西，却又不知道要来做什么——有时候，他会和一种不可知的神秘力量相碰撞，使他的梦想落空，使他的生活陷入不可自拔的境地。这个故事讲述的就是使他的梦想落空的其中一种神秘的力量，而非概述他的整个人生。

他开始挣钱了，真是不可思议。大学毕业后，他去了那个对黑熊湖青睐有加的富人们聚居的城市。年仅二十三岁的他到那里还不到两年，人们就常常欣慰地说：“瞧，这个小伙子——”他的周围到处都是富家子弟在冒着风险兜售债券，或者是拿着祖宗的家产做风险投资，或者埋头研读二十四卷本的《乔治·华盛顿商业课程》，而德克斯特却凭着一张大学文凭和一张信心十足的嘴巴借了一千块钱，在一家洗衣店入伙当了合伙人。

他加盟的时候，这家洗衣店还很小，但是德克斯特专门钻研了英国人洗涤优质高尔夫羊毛长筒袜不缩水的秘诀，一年之内，他的洗衣店便深得人心，迎合了穿灯笼裤的高尔夫爱好者们的需求。男人们一定要将“喜乐蒂”长筒袜和毛衣送到他的洗衣店，就像当年他们一定要找那个能帮他们找到高尔夫球的球童一样。不久，他又开始为这些男人们的太太们洗涤贴身内衣——并在这个城里的不同地方开了五家分店。还不到二十七岁，他就拥有了当地最大的洗衣连锁店。就在那时，他卖掉了自己在洗衣店的份额，去了纽约。不过，我们所关心的，是他刚刚飞黄腾达的那段日子。

他二十三岁的时候，哈特先生——是喜欢说“瞧，这个小伙子”的那群白发老先生中的一个——给了他一张雪莉岛高尔夫俱乐部的周末贵宾卡。于是，有一天，他在贵宾出席名单上签上了自己的名字。那天下午，哈特先生、桑德伍德先生、T. A.赫德里克先生和他进行了高尔夫球四人对抗赛。他觉得没有必要告诉大家，就在这同一个高尔夫球场上，他曾经为哈特先生拎过球袋；也没有必要告诉大家，他闭着眼睛就知道每一个障碍、每一道沟槽的位置——有四个球童跟在他们身后，他看着他们，力图从他们的音容笑貌和一举一动捕捉到自己当年的影子，以缩短横亘在他的过去与现在之间的鸿沟。

那天真是奇怪，熟悉的往事总是突如其来，又稍纵即逝。这一刻他还感觉自己是个偶然的闯入者——下一刻，面对T. A.赫德里克先生，他又有一种高高在上的优越感，因为赫德里克先生这个人不仅讨厌，而且连高尔夫球都永远打不好。

接着，因为哈特先生在第十五果岭附近丢了一个球，牵出了一件大事。正当他们在深草区的粗草地上找球的时候，一个清亮的声音从后面的山丘上传来：“闪开！”当所有人停止找球，猛然转过身来的时候，一只颜色鲜艳的右击球突然越过山丘打在T.A.赫德里克先生的小肚子上。

“天哪！”T. A.赫德里克先生叫道，“应该把这些疯女人从球场上赶出去。越来越不像话了。”

山丘上露出一个人头，同时传来一个声音：

“我们要从这里过去，介意吗？”

“你打到我的肚子了！”赫德里克先生歇斯底里地嚷道。

“是吗？”姑娘走到这群男人身旁，“抱歉，我叫你们‘闪开’了！”

她的眼神漫不经心地对着每个男人看了一眼——然后便扫视着球道去寻找她丢的那只球了。

“我的球是不是蹦到粗草(1)区里了？”

难以判断她是真的有疑问还是含沙射影，另有所指。不过，片刻之后，她就将答案揭晓了，因为她的搭档也爬上山丘了，她兴高采烈地大声叫道：

“找到了！如果不是有东西挡住，我的球就上了那道果岭了。”

她摆好姿势，准备用五号铁头球杆打短球的时候，德克斯特正在细细地打量她。她穿着一条蓝底方格纹棉布裙，领口和双肩处都镶着白边，更加突出了她那被晒黑了的肤色。她在十一岁时的故作姿态，单薄的身体，秋波盈盈的眼睛以及向下弯成两道弧线的嘴唇组合在一起的那种极不协调的感觉消失不见了，现在的她看起来楚楚动人。她双颊上的两点颜色就像丹青妙手的神来之笔——这颜色不是“红润”，它会流淌，会释放暖意，而且时明时暗，时隐时现，仿佛随时都会消退、消失一般。这奇妙的颜色和笑意盈盈的嘴巴无不让人觉得，她时而气韵流转，时而生机勃发，时而激情四射，而且种种感觉连续循环，不断变化——她顾盼生辉的眼睛中透着忧伤，只有这一点才将她给人的感觉减弱了几分。

她不耐烦地挥起五号铁头球杆，毫无兴致地将球击进对面果岭上的一个沙坑里。接着，脸上立刻露出了那种虚假的微笑，漫不经心地说了声“谢谢！”，便追了过去。

“那个朱迪·琼斯！”隔壁发球区的赫德里克先生说，他们等待着——等了一会儿——让她先打，“她就是欠揍，要是有人照着她的屁股，揍她个半年，再把她嫁给一个过气的骑兵队长当老婆，就万事大吉了。”

“天哪，她漂亮极了！”刚刚三十岁出头的桑德伍德先生说。

“漂亮极了！”赫德里克先生轻蔑地说，“她总是一副急着让人亲嘴的样子！转着母牛似的大眼珠子盯着城里的每一头小牛犊！”

要是以为赫德里克先生指的是母性的本能，这可值得怀疑。

“如果她好好打，她的高尔夫会打得很出色的。”桑德伍德先生说。

“她没那体形。”赫德里克先生一本正经地说。

“她的身材很好。”桑德伍德先生说。

“我们应该庆幸，她的球打得还不够快。”哈特先生朝德克斯特眨了一下眼说。

将近黄昏的时候，太阳落山了，洒下一片金色的余晖，放射出变幻不定的蓝色和紫色光线，将西部的天空交给了清爽多风的夏夜。德克斯特站在高尔夫俱乐部的露台上眺望，看着湖面被微风吹起的层层涟漪，在满月下面犹如银色的糖浆。然后，月亮似乎默默地做出暗示，让天地万物归于平静，于是，湖水变成一个清澈的游泳池，月色迷离，一片静谧。德克斯特穿上泳衣，朝最远处的充气码头游去，他浑身滴着水，伸展四肢，躺在跳板湿漉漉的帆布上。

一条鱼儿跳出水面，一颗星星在闪耀，湖的周围灯火通明。暗夜中的一个半岛上，一架钢琴在弹奏去年夏天以及前几年夏天流行的乐曲——从《请——请》《卢森堡公爵》到《巧克力士兵（无愁丘八）》——对德克斯特来说，在一望无际的湖面上，飘荡着悦耳动听的钢琴曲，这场景似乎总是妙不可言的，因此他一动不动地躺在那里，侧耳倾听。

这会儿，钢琴正在演奏一首快乐的曲子，这是五年前的一首新曲子。那时，德克斯特还在读大学二年级。有一次，他们在毕业舞会上演奏这首曲子，但是那时他没钱参加豪华的舞会，只能站在体育馆外面倾听。一听到这首曲子，他就会感到一阵猝然的狂喜，他带着这份狂喜，来看待他目前的际遇。他真是感到心满意足，他觉得天遂人愿，日子过得一帆风顺，周围的一切都让人觉得明媚和灿烂，这种感觉恐怕这辈子也就这么一次了。

一个灰蒙蒙的长方形物体突然沿着地面离开了黑漆漆的岛屿，发出赛艇才有的那种轰鸣声，在它身后划开两条浪花翻滚的白色水带。眨眼间，一艘汽艇便出现在他的身旁了，哗哗的水浪声淹没了钢琴激越而清脆的音乐声。德克斯特用胳膊支起身体，看到一个人站在机轮旁，两只黑溜溜的眼睛正隔着水面注视着他，两人渐行渐远——接着，汽艇呼啸而去，在湖心处漫无目的地绕起大圈子来，绕了一圈又一圈，所到之处水浪席卷而起。同样奇怪的是，汽艇的速度慢了下来，缓缓地转了一圈后，又驶回了充气码头。

“谁在那儿呢？”她关掉马达，大声问道。现在她离德克斯特非常近，近得他都能看清她穿的泳衣了，显然她穿的是粉红色的连体泳衣。

汽艇鼻子撞了一下充气码头，充气码头突然颠簸了一下，使他失去平衡，猛地朝她滚过来。他们互相认出了对方，然而他们心思却各不相同。

“今天下午打高尔夫球的那几个人当中就有你吧？”她问道。

他做了肯定回答。

“哦，你会开汽艇吗？因为要是你会的话，我希望你来开，这样的话，我就可以在后面用冲浪板冲浪了。我叫朱迪·琼斯——”她赏了他一个怪怪的傻笑——更确切地说，她有意做出傻笑的样子，比如说，她尽量把嘴歪到一边，可是这并不让人感到奇怪，反而可爱极了——“我住在岛那边的一幢房子里，有个男人在房子里等我。看到他把车开到门口，我就开着汽艇离开码头了，因为他说我是他的目标(2)。”

一条鱼儿跳出水面，一颗星星在闪耀，湖的周围灯火通明。德克斯特坐在朱迪身旁，她教他怎么开她的汽艇。然后，她跳进水里，用美人鱼一样的泳姿向漂在水上的冲浪板游去。看着她游泳，对眼睛来说是一种休息，就像看树枝在摇曳，海鸥在飞翔。她的胳膊晒得像灰胡桃果一样，在乳白色的涟漪间优雅地摆动，胳膊肘先露出来，接着小胳膊向后一摆，弹奏出抑扬顿挫的落水声，然后再向前一划，落入水中，在前面划出一条水痕。

他们行到湖的深处；德克斯特回头一看，只见她跪在翘起的冲浪板上，身子悬在冲浪板低下去的那头。

“开快点，”她喊道，“能开多快就开多快。”

他顺从地将操作杆往前猛地一推，船头便立刻腾起雪白的浪花。当他再次回头看的时候，这个姑娘已经站在冲浪板上，乘风破浪，双臂舒展，抬头看着月亮。

“快冻死了，”她大喊，“你叫什么名字？”

他告诉了她。

“哦，明天过来吃晚餐吧？”

他的心脏就像汽艇的飞轮一样跳得飞快，而她这随随便便的心血来潮再次为他的人生指出了一个全新的方向。

第二天晚上，德克斯特在等待朱迪·琼斯下楼的时候，开始胡思乱想起来，他仿佛觉得在这间幽深的、温情脉脉的湖滨避暑居室里以及和房间相通的阳台上到处都是比他先爱上朱迪·琼斯的男人们。他了解他们是什么样的人——他刚上大学那会儿，这些人已经穿着光鲜的衣服从久负盛名的预备学校里先他一步进入那所大学了，他们一个个皮肤黝黑，被夏季的太阳晒得油光发亮。一方面，他明白，他比这些人更有优势。他更年轻，更身强体壮。然而在他的内心深处，他承认他希望他的孩子们能和他们一样，这实际上是在承认他只不过是一介莽夫，而他的孩子们永远都摆脱不了他这样的出身。

当他终于可以衣着体面的时候，他已经知道哪些人是美国最好的裁缝，而今天晚上他身上穿的就是美国最好的裁缝为他量身定做的衣服。他已经秉承了他上的那所大学历来都具有的鲜明特征，即对细节一丝不苟的本领，这一点与其他大学截然不同。他意识到对细节一丝不苟的言行举止对他的意义非同一般，于是一开始就在刻意培养；他知道在穿着和礼仪方面粗枝大叶比谨小慎微更需要信心。不过，还是让他的孩子们粗枝大叶去吧。他的母亲名叫克利姆斯里奇，属于波西米亚的农民阶级，一辈子都没有说过一句流利的英语。她的儿子必须符合规范，改变一下门风。

七点钟刚过，朱迪·琼斯就下楼来了。她穿着蓝色的真丝套裙，一开始，看到她没有穿得更精致一点，他觉得有些失望。简单地寒暄了几句后，她走到厨房门口，推开门，叫道：“可以开饭了，玛莎。”他又多了几分失望。他觉得应该有一个男管家宣布开饭，而且饭前还应该喝点开胃酒。然而，当他们肩并肩地坐在长沙发上四目相对时，他的这种想法早就被抛到九霄云外了。

“父亲和母亲都不会来这里。”她善解人意地说。

他记得上次见到她父亲的情景，因此，他很高兴她的父母今晚不会来这儿——他们可能想知道他是谁。他在明尼苏达州的吉波尔村出生，一个从这里向北五十英里的地方。有人问起的时候，他总说他的家乡是吉波尔村而不说是黑熊村。乡村小镇如果能够眼不见心不烦，而且不与时尚的湖滨地带作陪衬，拿它来做自己的出生地也不见得丢人。

他们谈论他上的那所大学，她这两年也经常去；他们还谈论了附近的城市，这些城市的人们不断到雪莉岛来游玩，为雪莉岛带来金钱，德克斯特第二天也要到这些城市去打理他那红红火火的洗衣店生意。

吃晚饭的时候，她的心情很低落，这让德克斯特感到很紧张。她那嘶哑的声音说着任性的话，这让他感到坐立不安。无论她怎样微笑——看着他笑，看着鸡肝笑，或者什么也不看只管笑——都让他感到很惶恐。她的微笑里没有欢乐，甚至连开心都谈不上。当她的红嘴唇弯下去的时候，与其说她在笑，不如说她在发出亲吻的请柬。

接着，吃过晚饭，她把他领到黑漆漆的阳台上，她有意改变一下气氛。

“我想哭会儿，你介意吗？”她说。

“恐怕我让你心烦了。”他反应很快。

“没有的事。我喜欢你。只是，今天下午我过得糟透了。有一个人，我很在乎他，今天下午，青天白日的，他却告诉我，他穷得像个叫花子。以前，他哪怕暗示我一下也好。你说这个人是不是太有心机了？”

“也许他是不敢告诉你。”

“就算是他不敢告诉我，”她答道，“他一开始就不坦荡。你知道，如果我本来就认为他是穷人——哦，穷人有很多也挺招人喜欢的，我完全愿意和穷人结婚。但是，在这种情况下，我可不想嫁给他，我对他的兴趣还没有强烈到能够承受住这个打击。好像一个姑娘心平气和地告诉她的未婚夫，说她是个寡妇。他可能并不反对和寡妇结婚，只是——

“我们俩就坦坦荡荡地开始吧，”她突然转变话题，“你到底是怎样的人？”

德克斯特犹豫了一会儿，然后大声说道：

“我是无名小辈，从很大程度上来说，我的事业取决于未来。”

“你穷吗？”

“不穷，”他坦率地说，“我可能比西北部的任何一个同龄人都能挣钱。我知道这句话令人讨厌，不过，你说过，要以诚相待。”

一阵沉默过后，她笑了，她的嘴唇弯下去了，身体难以察觉地歪了一下，离他更近了。她仰起头，看着他的眼睛。德克斯特咽了口唾沫，屏住呼吸，等着做那个化学实验。他要看看，他们嘴唇上的化学元素会发生怎样神秘的反应，将会形成怎样不可预知的化合物。紧接着，他就看到了——她用排山倒海、来势汹汹的亲吻向他传达了她的激动之情，这不是一句口头承诺，而是真真切切地付诸行动了。亲吻在他的内心深处激起的感觉不是因为饥渴而渴望得到补充，而是过于富足却依然不能满足……亲吻就像做慈善，为了满足需求而慷慨解囊，毫不犹豫，毫无节制。

没过几个小时，他就断定，从那个骄傲的、充满梦想的少年时代开始，他就一直想得到朱迪·琼斯了。





四


爱情就这样开始了——并以这样的节奏一直持续到结束，其间，他们爱得起起伏伏。她这样直截了当、肆无忌惮的性格，德克斯特是见所未见、闻所未闻的。他在一定程度上把自己交付给她了。不管朱迪想要什么，她都会毫不保留地施展她的魅力，不达目的誓不罢休。她的方法一成不变，决不会为了谋取地位或达到预先设定的结果而耍手段——她和任何人谈恋爱几乎都不动什么心思。她只是最大限度地让男人们意识到她的美貌与可爱。德克斯特无意改变她。她的缺陷和她那澎湃的激情是合二为一、不可分割的，而且激情远远超越了缺陷，并让缺陷也似乎变得可爱起来。

就在那第一天晚上，她枕着他的肩膀，小声对他说：“也不知道是怎么回事，昨天晚上，我还以为我爱上了一个人，而今天晚上，我却觉得我爱上了你——”这些话在他看来似乎很美，很浪漫。一时之间他不由得热血沸腾，他努力控制着，幸福地品味着。然而，一个礼拜后，他不得不重新审视她的这种德行。一天晚上，她开着跑车带他去参加野餐派对，吃完晚饭，她开着同一辆跑车带着另一个男人不见了。德克斯特火冒三丈，当着在场的其他人，也几乎无法顾及最起码的斯文了。虽然她向他保证，她没有和那个人接吻，但是他知道她在撒谎——然而，她肯劳神费心地向他撒谎，他还是觉得挺欣慰的。

夏天结束前，他发现围着她团团转的竟有十二个不同的人，他只是这十二个人中的一个。他们中的每一个人都曾经独领风骚，从她那里得到的宠爱超过其他所有人——他们中大约有一半人依然满足于她那一星半点的施舍。一旦谁因为受到长时间的冷落而流露出想要放弃的迹象，她就会与他卿卿我我一番，赏给他一个小时的柔情蜜意，这样就能让他受到鼓舞，继续用一年或者更长的时间黏在她的身边。朱迪将这十二个无计可施、垂头丧气的人玩弄于股掌之间，却也没有恶意，她也的确几乎不知道她的这些作为有任何恶劣之处。

一旦有个新人粉墨登场，其他人都得靠边站——他们的约会就自动取消了。

要想对这一点做些什么的话，最难办的地方在于，局面全凭她掌控。而要想“赢得”她的青睐，靠拍马钻营这一套可行不通——她对小聪明和施展魅力之类的手腕具有免疫力。如果有谁咄咄逼人、来势汹汹的话，她就直接用身体来应付了事，她那令人意乱情迷的身体具有一种魔力：在这种魔力的迷魂阵中，任凭你多么强硬，多么富有才华，都会纷纷落入她温柔的陷阱里，迷失方向，无法自拔。只要她的个人欲望得到满足，充分施展了她的个人魅力，她就会快乐无比了。也许，她从这么多年轻人对她的爱慕中，从这么多年轻的情人身上渐渐地得到了彻底的滋养，而且她也很会自我保护。

在德克斯特的第一次兴奋过后，继之而来的是坐卧不安和不满足。他极度兴奋，难以克制，完全沦陷在她的城堡里，与其说他是中了毒，不如说他是吸食鸦片上了瘾。幸好，那个冬天他还有工作要做，这样极度兴奋的时刻来袭的次数并不是太多。他们相识之初，似乎一度深情地、发自内心地相互倾慕过——比如他们相识那年的八月——在她那夜色朦胧的露台上度过的三个久久不忍分离的漫漫长夜。那些在傍晚时分，在幽静的凉亭里或者在花园里花木掩映的格子棚架后面的那些奇妙销魂的长吻，她带着清新如梦的气息和娇羞欲滴的姿态迎接他的那些曙光初照的清晨。所有的一切都是人们订婚时才会有的狂喜和兴奋，而意识到他们并没有订婚，于是，他就愈加欢喜，愈加激动。就在那三天里，他第一次向她求婚。她的态度风云变幻，捉摸不定，一会儿说“没准哪一天我就会嫁给你”，一会儿又说“吻吻我吧”，一会儿说“我愿意嫁给你，只是……”，一会儿又说“我爱你”——一会儿她——她却什么也不说。

三天后，他们这种情意缠绵的约会便给人搅黄了。九月，一个纽约人到她的住所来访，并在她家待了半个月。令德克斯特苦恼的是，他们俩的绯闻被传得沸沸扬扬。这个纽约人是一家大信托公司总裁的儿子。但是到了月底，又传出朱迪和他已经玩腻了。在一天晚上的舞会上，她和一个当地的情郎在一艘汽艇里坐了一个晚上，而那个纽约人在俱乐部里到处疯狂地寻找她的踪迹。她告诉那个当地的情郎，她厌倦了她的那个客人，于是，两天后，那个客人便离开了。有人看见她送他去了车站，据说，他看起来伤心欲绝。

夏天就在这种基调中结束了。德克斯特二十四岁了，他发现自己的事业做得越来越风生水起。他参加了城里的两个俱乐部，并住在其中的一个俱乐部里。尽管他决非一定要成为这两个俱乐部里没有女伴的单身客，可他还是随时出现在朱迪·琼斯可能去的那个俱乐部里。他本可以随心所欲地到别处去参加社交活动——他现在是个有能耐的年轻人，很受那些家有女儿的商界大佬们的青睐。他对朱迪·琼斯的一片赤诚更让人觉得他对感情专一，更增加了人们对他的好感。然而他在社交方面并没有多大抱负，并且非常瞧不起那些总是泡在礼拜四或者礼拜日舞会上的男人们，他们和已婚的年轻人挤在一起进餐。他已经在考虑去东部的纽约了。他想带朱迪·琼斯一起去。在她从小到大生活的那个世界里，任凭你抱有什么幻想都得成为泡影，然而这一点却始终无法消除他对她抱有的幻想。

请记住这一点——因为只有明白了这一点，我们才能理解他为她付出的一切。

从他上次见到朱迪·琼斯的时候算起，又过了十八个月，他和另一个女孩订婚了。她的名字叫艾琳·谢雷尔，她的父亲是始终信任德克斯特的众多父亲中的一个。艾琳长着浅色头发，温柔大方，稍微有点胖，拥有两个追求者，当德克斯特正式向她求婚的时候，她便同他们和和气气地分手了。

夏秋冬春，四季已逝，接着，夏去秋来——他将如此多的大好年华慷慨地献给了朱迪·琼斯那无药可救的嘴唇。她对他时而兴致勃勃，时而引诱蛊惑，时而心怀叵测，时而冷若冰霜，时而又极尽鄙夷和嘲弄。她就这样让他受尽了冷落和羞辱——仿佛她喜欢过谁就得狠狠地报复谁似的。她对他呼之即来挥之即去，他常常痛心疾首，眯着眼睛疑惑地看着她。她把他带到幸福之巅，也把他带到精神的炼狱。她给他造成了难以启齿的痛苦，令他不胜其烦。她侮辱他，骑在他的头上作威作福，她——为了快活——玩弄他对她的感情，使他无法专心工作。除了谴责他，她对他无所不做。她没有谴责他，他觉得这似乎只是因为，这样做可能会玷污她那表里如一的冷血动物的英名。

秋天来了又去，他终于意识到他不可能拥有朱迪·琼斯了。经过反反复复的思考，他终于说服了自己。他曾经夜不成寐地躺在床上，同自己争论不休，他提醒自己她给他带来的烦恼和痛苦，他列举出她作为妻子的严重缺陷。可是，紧接着，他又喃喃自语，他爱她，爱她，说了一会儿，便睡着了。一个礼拜以来，为了不去想她打电话时的沙哑嗓音，不去想午饭时她从对面投来的目光，他就拼命工作，拼命加班；夜里，他到办公室处理事务以打发时间。

到了周末，他去参加舞会，插进去和她跳了一支舞。这一次，他没有请她一起出去坐坐，也没有对她说她很迷人之类的话，这几乎是自从他们认识以来的第一次。而她身边这样恭维她的可大有人在呢，他不这样说，有什么关系呢。这种情况更让他伤心——一切都结束了。今天晚上，他看见她又有了一个新的男朋友，他也不嫉妒。他早就练就一身刀枪不入的真功夫，早就嫉妒不起来了。

他在舞会上待到很晚，陪着艾琳·谢雷尔坐了一个小时，他们又谈书又谈音乐的。而他对书和音乐都知之甚少。不过，现在他是时间的主人了，可以自由安排自己的时间了。他突然有了一个相当自负的想法，他——年轻又事业有成的德克斯特·格林——应该多培养一些诸如此类的雅趣。

这些事情都发生在十月份，当时他二十五岁。到了一月，德克斯特和艾琳订了婚，订婚的消息准备在六月公布，然后再过三个月他们就准备完婚。

明尼苏达州的冬天长得没完没了，终于等到和风吹拂，积雪融化流入黑熊湖的时候，差不多已经是五月了。德克斯特一年来第一次开始领略心灵上的平静。朱迪·琼斯先去了佛罗里达，后来又去了温泉城，一会儿在某个地方订了婚，一会儿又在某个地方分了手。当初，当德克斯特决心要斩断与她的那段情思的时候，人们依然把他们联系在一起，依然向他打听她的消息，为此他感到很悲哀。然而吃饭的时候，他的位子和艾琳·谢雷尔的位子总是紧挨着，人们就再也不向他打听她的消息了——他们反而把她的消息告诉他。因为关于她的消息，他已经不再是权威了。

终于到了五月。晚上的空气潮湿如雨，德克斯特走在黑漆漆的街上，纳闷地想到，他还几乎没干出什么名堂呢，他就兴奋不起来了，再也找不到那种欣喜若狂的感觉了，似乎在一夜之间，整个人就变了。而一年前的那个五月，他的感情还处于风云激荡之中，还烙下了朱迪那尖酸刻薄、不可饶恕但最终还是被他饶恕了的印记——那时候他还抱着幻想，认为她会渐渐地爱上他，现在想来，这样的时候也还是挺难得的。为了得到那泛滥的满足，他葬送了自己无比珍贵的幸福。他知道艾琳只不过是挂在他身后的窗帘，是一只在闪闪发光的茶杯中间忙活的手，是一个召唤孩子们的声音……此情不再，伊人远去，那些令人意乱情迷的夜晚，那每个季节、每个时辰都不一样的奇妙感受……那向下一弯便落在他唇上的两片薄薄的嘴唇，那让他看一眼便可以飘飘欲仙的眼神……这些印象都深深地埋藏在他的心底，如此刻骨铭心，如此欲罢不能，他自然不会说忘记就忘记。

五月中旬，有几天天气处于向盛夏过渡的平稳期。一天晚上，他来到艾琳家。那时他们订婚的消息一个礼拜后就要宣布了——没有人会对这个消息感到奇怪的。这天晚上，他们会一起坐在大学俱乐部的长沙发上，准备坐上一个小时，作为旁观者看着人们跳舞。和她一起出去，他的心里总是充满了敬意——她太讨人喜欢，太出类拔萃了。

他登上台阶，走进这座上流社会的府邸。

“艾琳。”他喊道。

谢雷尔太太从起居室里出来迎接他。

“德克斯特，”她说，“艾琳头疼得厉害，上楼去了。她本来打算和你一起去的，不过我让她睡觉去了。”

“不要紧，我——”

“哦，别这样。她明天早上就能陪你打高尔夫球。你能批准她休息一个晚上吗，就一个晚上，可以吗，德克斯特？”

她笑容可掬。她和德克斯特互有好感。他们在起居室里聊了一会儿，然后他就道别了。

回到他租住的大学俱乐部，在门口站了一会儿，看着那些跳舞的人。他靠在门柱子上，朝一两个人点头致意——然后打了个哈欠。

“嗨，亲爱的。”

他的肘边传来了那个熟悉的声音，他吓了一跳。朱迪·琼斯从一个男人身边走开，穿过舞厅来到他身边——朱迪·琼斯，一个身材苗条的搪瓷娃娃，浑身金光闪闪的：头上戴着金色发带，裙裾下的两只轻便舞鞋尖也金灿灿的。她对他微微一笑，面如娇花，散发着动人的光晕。舞厅里立刻和风习习，一片光明。他插在晚礼服口袋里的手紧紧地握着，一阵一阵地痉挛，他一下子便激情迸发、心潮澎湃了。

“你什么时候回来的？”他若无其事地问。

“跟我来，我告诉你。”

她转身离去，他紧跟其后。她已渐行渐远——如今却回心转意，他要为这场邂逅痛哭一场才是。她一定在魔法城堡里修炼了一身蛊惑人心的本事。所有的那些曾经有过的神秘体验，所有的那些让人死而复生的新的希望，都曾经随着她的离去而消失，如今又随着她的归来而重现。

她在门口处转身问道：

“你有车吗？如果你没有，我有。”

“我有一辆小轿车。”

她随即上了他的车，身上金光闪闪的衣饰窸窣作响。他关上车门，不由得想，她不知上过多少人的车——这样的——那样的——她总是像这样靠在皮座椅上，胳膊肘搭在车门上等待着。这么久以来，除了她自己，但凡有人想玷污她，她绝对避免不了——因为她本性如此。

他努力收回脱缰的思绪，强迫自己发动车子，上了路。他必须记住，这没有任何意义。她以前也是这么干的，他已经将她抛之脑后了，仿佛将一段写坏了的文字从书中删除了似的。

他装作心不在焉的样子，穿过商业区悄无声息的大街，朝市区缓缓开去。商业区的街上，偶尔有三三两两的人从电影院里走出来，或者有几个小青年在桌球房前面晃荡着，有的蔫得像得了肺痨病似的，有的兴奋得像打了鸡血似的。酒吧传出叮当作响的碰杯声和用手猛击柜台的声音，回廊的彩釉玻璃透出昏暗的灯光。

她定定地瞧着他，沉默使两个人都很尴尬，然而面对这样的情感危机，他却不能随随便便找出几个词来亵渎此时此刻的气氛。在一个方便拐弯的地方，他七拐八绕地开回了大学俱乐部。

“想念我吗？”她突然问。

“大家都想念你。”

他不知道她是否已经听说艾琳·谢雷尔了。她才回来一天——他订婚的时候，差不多是她不在这里的时候。

“说得真好！”朱迪伤心地笑了笑——却看不出有什么可悲伤的。她审视着他，而他则专心致志地看着仪表盘。

“你比以前更帅了，”她若有所思地说，“德克斯特，你的眼睛最让人忘不了。”

听到这些话，他本可以一笑置之，但是他没有笑。这种话应该说给大二学生听。然而，他却中招了。

“我对什么都厌倦透了，亲爱的。”谁都是她的亲爱的，她会将这种代表个人交情笃厚的亲热话漫不经心地赐予每一个人，“我希望你娶我。”

她这样直白倒使他一下子反应不过来了。此时此刻，他应该告诉她，他马上就要和另一个姑娘结婚了，然而他却没能说出口。他倒真想向她发誓说，他从来都没有爱过他那个准新娘。

“我想我们能够和睦相处，”她继续说着，还是那副老样子，“除非你可能已经把我忘了，而爱上了另一个姑娘。”

很显然，她非常自信。实际上，她还说，她觉得他不可能爱上另一个姑娘，但如果他真的爱上了另一个姑娘，那也是犯了小孩子脾气，做了轻率幼稚的事——可能是为了炫耀一下，逗她吃醋。她会原谅他，因为这没什么大不了的，只要轻轻地把它拨到一边就行了。

“当然，除了我，你永远不可能爱上任何人，”她继续说，“我喜欢你爱我的样子。哦，德克斯特，你忘记去年我们在一起的情景了吗？”

“不，我没忘。”

“我也没忘！”

她是动了真情——还是表演太投入而被自己的演技感动了？

“我希望我们还能够像以前那样。”她说。他只好强迫自己做出回答：

“我想我们回不去了。”

“我也觉得我们回不去了……听说你正在对艾琳·谢雷尔穷追猛打呢。”

她一点都没有刻意强调这个名字，然而德克斯特却突然感到羞愧难当。

“好了，送我回家吧，”朱迪突然哭起来，“我不想和——和那些乳臭未干的小屁孩去跳那种愚蠢的舞了。”

于是，他拐了个弯，将车开到通向居民区的那条路上时，朱迪开始自顾自地小声抽泣起来。他以前从来没有看见她哭过。

黑漆漆的大街亮了起来，周围到处都兀立着有钱人的宅邸。他将小轿车停在莫蒂默·琼斯家门前。这座庞大的白色建筑物颇为气派，沐浴在润泽明亮的月光中，显得富丽堂皇。它的坚固程度让他大吃一惊。结实的墙壁，钢做的房梁，宽敞的空间，明亮的灯光，很是壮观。这与他身旁这个青春貌美的人儿形成了强烈的对比。它的雄壮突出了她的娇小轻盈——如同一只小小的蝴蝶的翅膀扇起的一缕微风。

他纹丝不动地坐着，而大脑却在翻江倒海地运转着。他怕稍稍动一下，她就会势不可挡地扑进他的怀抱。两颗泪珠顺着她那湿润的面颊扑簌簌地滚落下来，在她的上嘴唇上颤动着。

“我比任何人都漂亮，”她哽咽着说，“为什么我却过得不幸福？”她那泪汪汪的眼睛粉碎了他的平静——她的嘴唇慢慢地弯下去，一脸楚楚可怜的哀伤。“如果你想拥有我，我很愿意嫁给你，德克斯特。我想，你是不是觉得我不值得你拥有。可是，为了你，我会一直这么漂亮下去的，德克斯特。”

愤怒、骄傲、激动、憎恨、柔情蜜意，这千言万语都在他的唇上挣扎。接着，一阵剧烈的感情浪潮席卷而来，将积存已久的理智、传统舆论、顾虑和荣誉都席卷一空。说话的这个姑娘是他的女人，她属于他，她的美丽是献给他的，她就是他的骄傲。

“怎么不进来？”他听见她猛地吸了一口气。

她翘首以待。

“好，”他声音颤抖着说，“我这就进来。”





五


很奇怪，无论那天的事结束以后还是过了很久以后，他都不曾后悔过。朱迪对他的激情之火仅仅燃烧了一个月就熄灭了，这件事放在十年的漫漫人生路上实在是无足轻重。他对朱迪的臣服最终使他陷入更深的痛苦之渊，而且给艾琳·谢雷尔以及一直把他当作朋友的艾琳的父母都带来了严重的伤害，这在他心里也同样无关紧要。艾琳那无法形容的悲恸丝毫也没有打动过他。

德克斯特简直是冷血透顶。这个城市对他的这一举动持有的态度他也毫不在乎，不是因为他打算离开这个城市，而是因为关于这件事，任何外界的态度都显得过于肤浅。他对那满城风雨完全置若罔闻。当他明白，他凭一己之力，既不能感动朱迪·琼斯的心，也不能拥有她的人，他觉得对她怀有任何恶意也都无济于事。他爱她，而且这份爱将一直持续到地老天荒——只是，他无法拥有她。因此，他咀嚼着牢牢地驻扎在他内心深处的痛苦滋味，就像他偶尔品尝过的深深的幸福滋味一样。

甚至当最后朱迪以“不想把他从艾琳身边抢走”这个虚假的借口为由而结束了他们俩的关系时——朱迪，曾经为了得到他而不顾一切——也没有引起他的愤怒，他已经不知愤怒或欢乐为何物了。

二月，他去了东部，打算卖掉洗衣店，定居在纽约——然而，到了三月，美国爆发了战争，改变了他的计划。他返回西部，将生意交给合伙人打理，并于四月参加了首期军官培训营。他和那千千万万的年轻人一样，战争的到来反倒让他们感到有些如释重负，因而对战争抱着欢迎的态度，希望摆脱那张剪不断理还乱的情网。

记住，这篇故事并不是他的传记，尽管其中的有些事情与他青春年少时的梦想毫无关系，却也被我不知不觉地写进来了。现在，关于他们或他的事情，该说的差不多已经说完了，最后只有一件事还需要在这里提一提，这件事发生在七年之后。

事情发生在纽约。他在纽约混得很成功——简直是势如破竹，春风得意。他三十二岁了，除了战后立马飞回西部的那次行程之外，七年中他再也没有回去过。一个名叫德褔林的人从底特律来到他的办公室谈生意，而这件事就发生在那个时候，那个地点。可以说，它终结了他人生当中的这特殊的一面。

“这么说，你来自中西部，”这个叫德褔林的人漫不经心地说道，“很有趣——我本来以为，像你这样的人大概都是在华尔街那种繁华之地出生并长大的呢。你知道——我在底特律有个最好的朋友，他的妻子和你来自同一个城市。我是他们婚礼上的引座员。”

德克斯特等着他往下讲，不知道他要说什么。

“她叫朱迪·西蒙斯，”德褔林淡淡地说，“原名叫朱迪·琼斯。”

“哦，我认识她。”一种厌烦情绪立刻传遍他的全身。他当然听说她结婚了——其他的事情，他也许是有意不想知道得太多。

“这姑娘好极了，”德褔林若有所思地说，他并非别有用心，“我真有点为她感到惋惜。”

“为什么？”这句话触动了德克斯特的某根十分敏感的神经，于是他马上做出了反应。

“哦，不知道拉得·西蒙斯是不是哪根神经出问题了。我不是说他虐待她，我是说他总是喝得醉醺醺的，整天在外边游荡不着家——”

“她不是也一天到晚游荡在外不着家吗？”

“不，她待在家里带孩子。”

“哦。”

“对他而言，她已经是明日黄花了。”德褔林说。

“明日黄花！”德克斯特大叫一声，“喂，伙计，她只不过二十七岁。”

他突然产生了一个疯狂的念头，他要冲出去，冲到大街上，乘上火车到底特律去。他激动地站了起来。

“我想，您很忙吧，”德褔林赶忙致歉，“刚才我没有意识到——”

“不，我不忙，”德克斯特的声音缓和下来，“我一点都不忙，一点都不忙。刚才您说，她——二十七岁了，是吗？不，是我说的，她二十七岁了。”

“对，是你说的。”德褔林干巴巴地表示赞同。

“哦，你接着说，接着说。”

“你是什么意思？”

“接着说朱迪·琼斯。”

德褔林不知如何是好地看着他。

“呃，就那么多了——我能告诉你的也就那么多了。他像魔鬼一样威胁她。嗯，他们倒不至于离婚，不会发生那种事的。他大发脾气的时候，她总是能够原谅他。实际上，我觉得，她爱他。她刚到底特律的时候，是个十分漂亮的姑娘。”

漂亮的姑娘！这个说法让德克斯特觉得很好笑。

“难道她——不再是个漂亮的姑娘了吗？”

“哦，她现在还过得去。”

“你瞧，”德克斯特突然坐下来说，“我不明白，你说她过去是个‘漂亮的姑娘’，而现在你又说她‘还过得去’。我不明白你的意思——朱迪·琼斯根本不能说是个漂亮的姑娘，根本不能。她可是个大美女，哦，我认识她，我认识她。她过去——”

德褔林愉快地笑起来。

“我可不想吵架，”他说，“我觉得朱迪是个好姑娘，我挺喜欢她的。我不明白一个像拉得·西蒙斯这样的男人怎么会疯狂地爱上她，可是，他那时的确如此。”接着他补充说：“大多数女人都和她一样。”

德克斯特仔细地看着德褔林，拼命地想，他这么说肯定是事出有因，这个人是愚钝呢，还是有什么私人恩怨。

“许许多多的女人都是那样人老色衰的，”德褔林打了个响指，“这种事情，你一定见过。也许，我已经忘记她结婚那天有多漂亮了。自打她结婚后，我见她的次数太多了，你知道的。她的眼睛非常漂亮。”

德克斯特的意识突然模糊了起来，他平生第一次觉得自己似乎是酩酊大醉了。他知道，德褔林刚才说了句什么话逗得他哈哈大笑，可是他记不清那句话是什么了，也不记得那句话有什么可笑的。过了一会儿，德褔林走了，他就躺在长椅上，望着窗外。太阳已经落下地平线，向纽约的天空投射出粉红色和金色的霞光，使傍晚的天空虽不明艳却很动人。

他曾经想，他再也没有什么可失去的了，他终于刀枪不入，能承受住任何打击了——可是，他知道，他刚刚已经又失去了一些东西。这种东西如此真切，仿佛是他和朱迪·琼斯结了婚，眼睁睁地看着她渐渐地年老色衰，花容不再。

梦消失了，好像有什么东西从他身上剥离出去。他的心头一阵恐慌，赶忙用手掌捂住眼睛，努力回想那曾经的一幅幅画面：雪莉岛的层层水波，露台上的月光，海滨高尔夫球场上的方格纹棉布裙，明媚的太阳，她脖子上那金黄色的小绒毛，等着他亲吻的湿润的嘴唇，忧伤的眼神，她那如崭新的高档亚麻布在早晨散发的清新气息。哦，这些东西都不复存在了！它们曾经存在过，如今却再也回不来了。

多少年来，他第一次泪流满面。然而，此时此刻，他是在为自己流泪。模糊的眼睛，啜泣的嘴巴，在脸上震颤的双手，他全都不管了，他管不了这么多了。他的心已经死了，再也不能死而复生了。大门已经关闭，太阳已经西沉，除了钢铁那灰蒙蒙的美，没有哪种美可以经受得住时间的考验。即便他现在还能够感到悲伤，那也是在为他那片梦想之乡，他那曾经的青春年少，他当初那天马行空地做着冬日梦的旺盛的生命在悲叹了。

“很久以前，”他说，“很久以前，我心中还有些憧憬和梦想，然而，现在，一切都不在了。一切都不在了，不在了。哭泣也没有用了，想也没有用了。我心中的憧憬和梦想一去不复返了。”

(1) 这里的英文单词是rough，语义双关，既指高尔夫球场障碍区域的粗草或深草区，又指赫德里克的粗鄙。

(2) 这句话的原文是：because he says I’m his ideal. Ideal在这里有两层意思，其一是指“心上人”，其二还保留有“目标”之意，所以朱迪借用其“目标”之意，说了句俏皮话。即因为他说我是他的目标，所以我不可能在家里等着他，而要远远地离开他，让他遥望、追求。





明智之举


一


在美国庄严神圣的午饭时刻，年轻的乔治·欧凯利故作镇静地整理着桌子，一副兴趣盎然的样子。办公室里没有人知道其实他心里急得要命，因为成功无非是凑个人气，至于他的心思不在工作上而在七百英里之外的地方，这一点是不能逢人便说的。

可是一走出办公楼，他就咬紧牙关，开始跑起来，一边跑还一边到处观望。早春时节明媚的正午，时代广场上洋溢着欢乐的气氛，欢声笑语在人们头顶不到二十英尺的地方飘荡。大家都微微仰着头，深深地呼吸着三月里清新的空气，阳光照得人眼花缭乱，因此，大家几乎都不看别人，只盯着自己在空中的影像。

乔治·欧凯利的心早已飞到七百英里之外了。他觉得户外活动都是极其可怕的。他冲进地铁，穿过九十五个街区，猫着身子激动地盯着车厢里的一幅宣传广告，这幅广告生动地向他展示了十年中他只有五分之一的机会保住他的牙齿。在第一百三十七大街上，他止住对商业广告艺术的探究，下了地铁，又开始跑起来。此时此刻，他甩开不知疲倦的脚步，心急如焚地朝家中狂奔——他的家只有一间屋子，在一个不起眼的地方的一套楼层又高条件又差的公寓里。

桌子上放着那封信——信是用神圣的墨汁和神圣的纸张写成的——城里的人们要是仔细倾听，就都能听到乔治·欧凯利的心跳。他看着信上的每一个标点符号、每一个墨迹、空白处的拇指印——然后，便无望地一头扎到床上了。

他的处境十分不妙，这种极其困顿的情形在穷人的生活中司空见惯。困顿和穷人如影随形，犹如鸟儿天生就要成为猎物。任凭穷人怎样上下求索、左右出击或听天由命，都无法摆脱贫穷的命运——然而乔治·欧凯利非常不适应贫穷的生活，因此，要是有人否认他的情况是个特例，他一定会感到十分震惊。

一年多以前，他以优异的成绩从麻省理工学院毕业，并且在南方的田纳西州的一家建筑公司找到一份工程师的工作。他从小就一门心思地想着隧道、摩天大厦、巨大的水坝、有三座桥头堡的高桥，桥上的桥头堡就像拉着手排成一排的舞者，她们的头颅像城市一样高，桥上的吊索就像她们的裙子。改变河流山川的走向和地貌就能让世界上古老贫瘠的不毛之地焕发出一派生机，在乔治·欧凯利看来是十分浪漫的事。他喜欢钢铁，常常梦见自己的周围都是钢铁，钢水、钢条、钢块、钢梁以及可塑的软钢在等着他一展宏图，就像他手中的颜料和帆布画布一样。取之不竭、用之不尽的钢材被他那熊熊燃烧的想象之火锻造得既质朴又漂亮……

目前，他在一家保险公司当职员，每个礼拜只能挣四十美元。他与梦想的距离迅速拉大，梦想已经遥不可及了。那个皮肤黝黑的小姑娘造成了这种不幸的局面，这种可怕的、无法忍受的局面，而她正在田纳西的一个小镇上等着他去见她。

十五分钟后，那个女人，他的二房东，无比好心地来敲他的门，问他既然回来了，要不要吃午饭。他摇摇头，但是房东已经把他吵醒了，他就起床写了封电报。

“来信令我伤心你是没信心还是太傻太失望才要分手为什么不马上嫁给我我们一定能幸福——”

他心乱如麻，犹豫了一会儿，又随手补充了一句连他自己都不敢相信的话：“明早六点不见不散。”

写完，他便跑出公寓，奔向地铁站附近的电报局。他在这个世界上连一百块钱的财产都没有，然而，她在信中流露出“不安”的情绪，所以他别无选择。他知道“不安”意味着什么——意味着她情绪低落，意味着她将要嫁给一个穷光蛋而过上一贫如洗的生活，这样的婚姻前景再加上她内心的纠结和挣扎，为她的爱情带来了不堪承受的重压。

乔治·欧凯利一如既往地跑到保险公司，奔跑几乎已经变成他的第二个天性，似乎也最大限度地表现出他正生活在巨大的压力之下。他径直朝经理办公室走去。

“我有事找您，查姆博斯先生。”他上气不接下气地大声说。

“什么事？”经理的两只眼睛瞪得像冬天里的窗户一样，冷冷地、不耐烦地看着他。

“我想请四天假。”

“怎么回事，两个礼拜前你才刚刚请过假！”查姆博斯先生吃惊地说。

“的确如此，”这位忧心如焚的年轻人坦率地承认道，“可是，我还得请个假。”

“上次你去哪里啦？回老家了吗？”

“没有回老家，我去了——田纳西的一个地方。”

“那么，这一次你要去哪里？”

“呃，这次我想去——田纳西的一个地方。”

“不管怎么说，你还挺执着的，”经理干巴巴地说，“不过，我原来并不知道，公司是让你来做旅游销售的。”

“我不是做旅游销售的，”乔治绝望地叫道，“可我必须去。”

“好吧，”查姆博斯先生同意了，“不过，你不必回来了。所以，就别回来了！”

“我不会回来了。”这句话让他自己和查姆博斯先生都大吃一惊。乔治兴奋得满面红光，他觉得很开心，简直欢欣雀跃——半年来，他第一次拥有了彻底的自由。他的眼中蓄满了感激的泪花，激动地一把握住了查姆博斯先生的手。

“我想感谢您，”他一阵冲动，动容地说，“我不想回来了。如果你说我还可以回来，那我才会发疯呢。您知道，让我自己提出辞职，我做不到，因此我想谢谢您——谢谢您辞退了我。”

他颇有气度地挥了挥手，用洪亮的声音说道：“你还欠我三天工资呢，不过，你留下好了！”说话间便冲出了办公室。查姆博斯先生按铃叫来了速记员，问他欧凯利最近是不是看起来很古怪。在他的职业生涯中，他解雇过很多人，尽管他们的态度各有不同，但是没有一个人会对他感恩戴德——这真是前所未有的奇事啊！





二


她叫琼奎尔·凯利。对乔治·欧凯利而言，没有什么能够比得上她一看到他便不顾一切地沿着站台朝他飞奔而来时的那张清新娇柔的脸庞。她的两只胳膊举得高高的要扑进他的怀抱，嘴唇半张着，等待他的亲吻。突然，她又轻轻地挣脱他的怀抱，有点难为情地向四周看了看。两个比乔治稍微年轻点的男孩就站在旁边。

“这是克拉道客先生和赫尔特先生，”她愉快地说，“以前你在这里的时候见过他们的。”

亲吻一下子变成了见面介绍，乔治怀疑这其中蕴含着某种用意，内心有些不悦，当他发现载着他们去琼奎尔家的汽车是其中一个年轻人的，就更加摸不着头脑了。这种情况似乎对他很不利。琼奎尔与前后座的几个人聊了一路，当他想趁着夜色悄悄用一只胳膊拥她入怀的时候，她赶紧递给他一只手，让他握着。

“这是去你家的路吗？”他小声问道，“我都认不出来了。”

“这是新修的一条林荫大道。杰瑞今天刚买了这辆新车，他想在送我们回家前让我先睹为快。”

二十分钟后，他们在琼奎尔家下了车。乔治发现，他们在车站初相见时的幸福以及她眼中分明流露出的欢乐已经被这突如其来的汽车之旅给消解掉了。他的期盼就这么不经意地消失了，他一边语气生硬地向两个年轻人道晚安，一边陷入了沉思。然后，在前厅昏暗的灯光下，琼奎尔将他拉入他所熟悉的怀抱，用十几种方式——对乔治来说，最好的方式便是她默默无语的样子——对他进行百般抚慰，说她多么想他，才渐渐消除了他心头的不快。她的抚慰给他吃了颗定心丸，让他那颗悬着的心踏实下来，让他觉得一切都会安然无恙。

他们一起坐在沙发上，完全陶醉于彼此的存在，除了偶尔喃喃地叫着彼此的昵称，他们将一切都置之度外了。晚饭的时候，琼奎尔的父母亲来了，他们见到乔治都很高兴。他们喜欢他。一年多以前，他刚刚来到田纳西的时候，他们很满意他的工程师职业。当他放弃这个职业去纽约寻求发财捷径的时候，他们感到很惋惜。尽管他们责怪他半途而废，却也很理解他，并愿意接受他们订婚。吃晚饭的时候，他们询问了他在纽约的发展情况。

“一帆风顺，”他满腔热情地告诉他们，“我升职了——工资也涨了。”

说这些违心话，他心里很难受——不过，他们都非常开心。

“他们一定很赏识你，”凯利太太说，“这一点毫无疑问——否则，他们不会允许你在三个礼拜里请两次假到这儿来的。”

“我告诉他们，他们必须这么做，”乔治赶忙解释，“我告诉他们，如果他们不同意我请假，我就再也不为他们工作了。”

“可是你也应该省着点花钱啊，”凯利太太嗔怪道，“不能把钱都扔到路上啊，路费这么贵。”

吃完晚饭——就剩下他和琼奎尔了，她又回到他的怀抱里。

“有你在这儿，我真是太高兴了，”她叹了口气，“希望你再也不要离开了，亲爱的。”

“想我吗？”

“哦，想死了，想死了。”

“你——其他男人常来看你吗？比如说今天那两个小屁孩。”

这个问题令她大吃一惊，她用两只黑天鹅绒似的眼睛注视着他。

“哦，当然有，他们经常来看我。一直都是这样。哦——我在信里都告诉过你的，亲爱的。”

这话不假——他当初来到这座城市的时候，她的身边已经围了十多个男孩子了。他们带着青春期的热情，对她那弱柳扶风般的婀娜身姿崇拜得五体投地，有几个小伙子还发现她那双漂亮的眼睛既理智又温柔。

“你希望我永远哪儿都不去——”琼奎尔靠在沙发垫上看着他，仿佛与他有千里之遥，“就这样抱着胳膊，静静地坐在这里——一直坐到地老天荒吗？”

“你这是什么话？”他心里一急，脱口而出地问道，“你的意思是不是说，我永远都没有钱娶你为妻？”

“哦，不要断章取义，乔治。”

“我没有断章取义。你刚刚就是这么说的。”

乔治突然意识到自己身处险境。他本来打定主意，不让任何事情破坏这良辰美景的。他想再次拥她入怀，她却出乎意料地拒绝了，她说：

“天太热了，我去把电扇打开。”

她把电扇调到合适的风速，他们重新坐下来，然而他变得极度敏感起来，不知不觉地陷入了他原本要极力避免的那个特殊的话题当中。

“你打算什么时候嫁给我？”

“我嫁给你，你准备好了吗？”

他心中突然蹿起一股无名之火，站起身来。

“关掉这该死的电扇吧，”他叫道，“我快被它逼疯了。它像一只破钟似的‘咔嗒’个没完，要葬送我和你在一起的所有时间。我来这儿是想寻找幸福，忘掉纽约的一切烦心事，忘掉时间——”

他又一屁股坐到沙发上，就像他刚才站起来时一样突然。琼奎尔关掉电扇，将他的头揽进她的怀里，抚摸着他的头发。

“我们就这样坐着吧，”她温柔地说，“就这样静静地坐着，我会把你带到梦中。你太累了，太紧张了，让你的心上人照顾你吧。”

“可是，我不想就这样坐着，”他突然坐起来，悻悻地说，“我一点都不想这样坐着，我想让你吻我。只有你的吻才能让我安静下来。还有，我一点都不紧张——是你在紧张。我才不紧张呢。”

为了证明他不紧张，他离开沙发，走到房间的另一边，一下子陷进一把摇椅里。

“我正在为娶你做准备的时候，却收到你的这些紧张兮兮的来信，弄得像是要悔婚似的，我迫不得已，只得匆匆忙忙地赶来见你——”

“你如果不想来，就不必来嘛。”

“可是我确确实实想来！”乔治坚持说。

他似乎觉得自己很冷静，很理智，而她则是别有用心，故意激怒他，将他置于错误百出的境地。他们每说一句话都只会将彼此的距离拉得更远——可他管不住自己的嘴巴，也无法掩饰言语之间的担忧和痛苦。

然而，琼奎尔突然伤心地号啕大哭起来。他回到沙发边，抱住她，现在他变成安慰者了。他将她的头拉到他的肩头，轻轻地对她重复着往日的情话，她渐渐地平静下来，只是还会在他怀里一阵一阵地微微颤抖。他们在那里坐了一个多小时。这时，那抑扬顿挫的钢琴曲突然接近尾声，变得激越昂扬起来，连外面的大街上都清晰可闻。乔治的身体一动不动，大脑也停止了思想，也不再希冀什么，只是麻木地感受这山雨欲来的暂时平静。时钟还会嘀嘀嗒嗒地敲下去，十一点，十二点，然后凯利太太和蔼可亲的叫声就会从楼梯扶手处传到楼下——除此之外，他看到的只是明天和绝望。





三


导火索在第二天的炎热天气中引爆。他们已经猜到了对方的真实意图，然而两个人中她更易于面对现实。

“没必要继续下去了，”她痛苦地说，“你自己知道你讨厌保险，所以你永远也别想做好。”

“不是这样的，”他拒不承认，“我只是不喜欢一个人跑业务，如果你愿意嫁给我，和我同甘共苦，和我一起去碰运气，我什么都能干好。但是，如果你待在这里不肯跟我走，我就会整天担心你，就没有心思干工作了。”

她沉默良久，然后不假思索地做出回答——因为她已经看到他们的关系走到了尽头——只不过是在等待一个合适的时机说破而已，因为她知道，她每说出一个字都只会比上一个字更加残忍。她终于说话了：

“乔治，我是全心全意爱你的，而且我不知道，除了你，我还能不能爱上别人。如果两个月前，你准备好娶我的话，那么现在我已经是你的妻子了——可现在我不能嫁给你了，因为这似乎不是明智之举。”

他强烈地谴责了她——她一定是有别人了——她对他隐瞒了实情！

“不，没有别人。”

这是事实，然而由于他们的爱恋给她带来了很大的压力，为了释放这种压力，她和像杰瑞·赫尔特这样的小毛孩交往，这些小毛孩有个好处，即他们绝对不会对她的生活产生任何影响。

乔治没有处理好这种情况，绝对没有处理好。他紧紧地抱住她，一心想亲吻她，他想用亲吻逼她立刻答应嫁给他。这一招失灵后，他又开始了漫长的独白，自说自话地将自己可怜了一番。当他发现她以鄙视的眼神看着他的时候方才作罢。他无意离开，却扬言要走；而当她认为他最好离开时，他却偏偏不走。

有那么一会儿，她觉得对不住他；又有那么一会儿，她的心彻底软了下来。

“你最好现在就走吧。”她终于咆哮起来，她的声音非常大，以至于凯利太太惊慌失措地跑下楼来。

“出什么事了吗？”

“我要走了，凯利太太。”乔治语不成声地说。琼奎尔已经离开了房间。

“不要太过悲伤，乔治。”凯利太太朝他挤挤眼，一脸无奈和同情——她很遗憾，但同时，她也感到宽慰，因为这小小的悲剧就要演完了。“如果我是你，我就回家，回到妈妈身边待上一个礼拜。也许，这才是明智之举——”

“请不要再说了，”他大吼一声，“现在，一句话都不要和我讲了！”

琼奎尔再次走进房间，脂粉、口红和帽子掩去了她的悲伤和怒气。

“我已经叫了一辆出租车，”她冷淡地说，“我们可以出去兜兜风，顺便送你去坐火车。”

她走出屋子，来到房前的廊下。乔治穿上外套，戴上帽子，有气无力地在客厅里站了一会儿——自从离开纽约，他几乎没吃一口东西。凯利太太走过来，扳着他的头在他的脸上亲了一下。他觉得很可笑，很软弱。他早就知道，这种场面结果一定是可笑的，一定是让人感到软弱的。如果他昨天晚上就离开的话——带着体面的尊严最后一次离开她，该有多好。

出租车来了，这对曾经的恋人在陌生的大街上兜了一个小时的风。他握着她的手，在阳光下变得冷静多了，他终于后知后觉地明白，他们已经无事可做、无话可说了。

“我还会回来的。”他对她说。

“我知道你还会回来的，”她答道，她尽量说得令人振奋，显得颇有信心，“而且我们还要给彼此写信——有时间就写。”

“不，”他说，“我们不要写信。我受不了。反正我会回来的。”

“我永远都忘不了你，乔治。”

他们到了火车站，她陪他一块去买票……

“喂，乔治·欧凯利，琼奎尔·凯利！”

打招呼的是一对男女，乔治在这里工作时认识了他们。有他们在，琼奎尔似乎如释重负。在那漫长的五分钟里，他们都站在那里聊天。火车终于呼啸着进站了，乔治笨拙地掩饰着一脸苦相，向琼奎尔张开双臂。她犹豫不决地向前迈了一步，身子摇晃了一下，然后，匆匆地在他的一只手上按了一下，仿佛是在和一个点头之交握手道别。

“再见，乔治，”她说，“祝你旅途愉快。”

“再见，乔治，记得回来看看我们大家啊。”

木然的乔治痛苦得几乎什么都看不见了，他提起箱子，跌跌撞撞地上了火车。

火车“哐当哐当”地穿过一个个十字路口，开始加速前进，在郊区广阔的田野上朝着落日的方向一路狂奔。也许她也愿意欣赏一下夕阳美景，愿意在那里稍作停留，还会回头张望，还会时时怀念，而他终将从她的梦中渐渐消失，成为过眼云烟。这天晚上的夜幕终将永远遮蔽他那年轻时代的阳光、树木、花草和欢声笑语。





四


第二年九月的一个潮湿的下午，一个脸膛被晒成棕榈黑的年轻人从田纳西的一列火车上走下来。他不安地朝四周张望了一番，当他发觉没有人来车站接他的时候，似乎松了一口气。他打车来到城里最好的一家宾馆，满意地在入住登记簿上写下：秘鲁，库斯科，乔治·欧凯利。

他走进楼上的客房，在窗户边坐了一会儿，看着下面那条熟悉的街道。然后，他用一只微微颤抖的手拿起话筒拨了一个号码。

“琼奎尔小姐在家吗？”

“我就是。”

“哦——”他稳了稳有点颤抖的声音，才用亲近却拘谨的口气继续说道：

“我是乔治·欧凯利，收到我的信了吗？”

“收到了。我以为你今天会到家里来呢。”

她的声音冷静又淡然，这让他很不快，而且与他的期望大相径庭。这个声音很陌生，丝毫没有兴奋之情，她说她非常高兴和他见面——仅此而已。他想放下话筒透透气。

“很久——不见了。”他成功地让自己说得漫不经心，“一年多了。”

他清清楚楚地记得那是多久——一天都不会错。

“再次听到你的声音真是太高兴了。”

“我大约一个小时后到你那儿。”

他挂断电话。在四个漫长的季节里，只要一有空，他的脑海里无时无刻不在期盼这一刻的到来，如今这一刻真的到来了。他曾经想过，她是不是已经嫁人了，是不是已经订婚了，是不是已经爱上别人了——而他唯一没有想过的是，她会对他的归来无动于衷。

他觉得，在他的一生中，他刚刚度过的那漫长的十个月再也不会重来了。作为一名年轻的工程师，他已经展露出令人交口称赞的卓越才华——他接连撞了两次大运，一次是在秘鲁，另一次是在纽约。他这次从秘鲁回来后，很快就要去纽约发展。在这短短的时间内，一贫如洗的他摇身一变，拥有了一个前途无可限量的职位。

他从梳妆台的镜子里打量着自己。他晒得像炭一样黑，然而这种黑却有一种浪漫情调。上个礼拜，当他有空想到这一点的时候，心中不由得喜滋滋的。他如痴如醉地欣赏着他那壮硕的身材。他的眉毛脱落了一些，膝盖上戴着弹力护膝。不过，他毕竟太年轻，不会没注意到汽艇上有许多女人纷纷向他投来热辣辣的目光。

他穿的衣服当然很吓人，那是利马的一个希腊裁缝在两天内为他赶制出来的。他还是太年轻了，在那封简短的便笺里，他向琼奎尔解释了这身衣服的缺陷。信中还有一个细节，他要求她不要到车站来接他。

来自秘鲁库斯科的乔治·欧凯利在宾馆等了一个半小时，确切地说，直等到烈日当头。然后，他刮好脸，扑了些滑石粉使肤色更接近白种人，在最后的那一刻，虚荣心战胜了浪漫情怀。他叫了辆出租车，朝着那幢他再熟悉不过的房子出发了。

他感到呼吸困难——他意识到了这一点。不过，他告诉自己，这是因为兴奋，和感情无关。他回来了；她没有嫁人——这就够了。他甚至不知道该对她说些什么。然而他觉得这一刻是他人生当中最不能轻易抹去的一笔。毕竟，如果没有一个姑娘来分享，他的胜利就毫无意义，况且就算他不能把战利品呈到她的脚下，至少也能捧到她的面前，哪怕是稍纵即逝的一瞬间呢。

这幢房子突然出现在他的身旁，他的第一反应便是：它似乎有一种奇怪的虚幻感。什么也没有变——又什么都变了。它似乎比以前小了，破了——往日那一团团充满魔力的云彩再也不会在房顶上盘桓了，再也不会从楼上那扇窗户里飘出来了。他按响门铃，一个陌生的黑人女仆为他开了门，并告诉他琼奎尔小姐马上就下来。他紧张地舔了舔嘴唇，走进客厅——虚幻感更强了。他明白，这毕竟只是一个普通的房间，而不是那个曾经让他撕心裂肺、备受煎熬的魔法屋。他在一把椅子上坐下来，当他发现自己坐着的竟然是一把椅子时，不由大吃一惊。他方才意识到，他以前的想象力将这些简陋的、司空见惯的东西都理想化了，将它们的形状和色彩都美化了。

接着，门开了，琼奎尔走了进来——眼前的一切仿佛突然模糊起来。他已记不清她那美丽的容颜了，只觉得自己脸色煞白，他的声音到了喉咙里却变成了一声微弱的叹息。

她一身浅绿色装扮，一条金色发带将她那乌黑柔顺的秀发束到后面，看上去简直像一顶王冠。她进门的一瞬间，她那双久违的、天鹅绒般的眼睛正好与他的目光相遇，看到她那令人痛不欲生的美，他的全身顿时袭来一阵恐惧的震颤。

他说了声“嗨”，两人便都向前走了几步，握了握手。然后各自坐到遥遥相隔的椅子上，从房间的两边对视着。

“你回来了。”她说。他回答得毫无新意：“我想顺道来看看你。”

他的目光游移不定，就是不看她的脸，他想以此来稳住颤抖的声音。他有责任打破僵局，然而，除非他马上开始自吹自擂，否则似乎实在无话可说。以他们之前的关系来看，再也找不到那份让人倍感温馨的随意了——这种情况下，总不见得谈论天气吧。

“真是可笑，”他突然尴尬地说，“我实在有点不知所措。我来这里打扰到你了吗？”

“哪里的话。”这个回答既谨慎含蓄，又透着淡淡的忧伤。他感到很沮丧。

“你订婚了吗？”他问道。

“没有。”

“你有心上人了吗？”

她摇摇头。

“哦。”他靠了靠椅子。似乎找不到别的话题了——这次会面完全不在他设想的轨道上。

“琼奎尔，”他说，他的声音更加柔和了，“毕竟，我们之间发生了不希望发生的事情，我就是想回来看看你。将来无论如何，我都不会像爱你一样去爱别的姑娘了。”

这句话是他事先排练好的。在轮船上时，这么说似乎恰到好处——既传达出他素来对她怀有的柔情，又掺杂着他目前模棱两可的暧昧态度。可是现在，他被过去重重包围，气氛越来越凝重，似乎充满了戏剧性，让人觉得陈腐。

她一言不发，静静地坐着，两眼盯着他，脸上的表情似乎已经说明了一切，又似乎什么也说明不了。

“你不再爱我了，是吗？”他平静地问她。

“是的。”

过了一会儿，凯利太太走了进来，和他聊起他取得的业绩——当地报纸已经用了半个版面报道过他的事迹——他的心里真是五味杂陈。他知道他现在依然爱着这个姑娘，他知道过去有时还会再回来——这样就够了。剩下的事情就是，他一定要坚强谨慎，然后拭目以待。

“现在，”凯利太太说，“你们两个去看看那位种菊花的太太吧。她特别嘱咐我，说想见见你，因为她在报纸上看到你的事了。”

他们去看望那位菊花太太。路上，他发现她的小碎步总是落在他的脚步之间，这让他感到很兴奋。菊花太太很慈祥，她种的菊花花朵硕大，美丽无比。菊花太太的花园里到处都是菊花，白色的、粉红色的、黄色的，真是五彩缤纷。置身于菊花园中，简直就像是回到了盛夏。菊花太太总共有两个花园，中间隔了一道门；他们迈着悠闲的步子去赏第二个花园的花，菊花太太先行一步出了这道门。

这时，发生了一件奇怪的事。乔治走到旁边，让琼奎尔先过去，但是她没有过去，而是静静地站在原地看了他一会儿。她的脸上没什么表情，也没有笑意，她只是沉默了片刻。他们四目相对，每个人的呼吸都急促起来，然后他们便步入第二个花园。仅此而已。

天色渐晚，他们向菊花太太道了谢，然后就心事重重地、慢吞吞地肩并肩朝家中走去。晚饭的时候，他们都很沉默。乔治对凯利先生讲了一些他在南美洲的经历，力图向他们传达出自己的未来会一帆风顺。

吃过晚饭，他和琼奎尔单独待在房间里，这个房间见证了他们的爱情自始至终的全部过程。对他而言，这似乎是一件遥远的、无以名状的伤心事。就在那张沙发上，他曾经感受过一生中最为深切的痛苦和悲伤。今后，他再也不会那样懦弱，那样疲惫，那样痛苦，那样可怜了。然而，他知道，十五个月前的那个热血男儿内心拥有的可贵品质，那种信任和热情，如今都消失殆尽了，再也找不回来了。明智之举——他们做出了明智之举。他已经用他的第一次青春做赌注，换来了力量，取得了成功，摆脱了绝望。然而，命运之手却剥夺了他那清纯的爱情，连同他的青春。

“你不愿意嫁给我了，是吗？”他低声问道。

琼奎尔摇了摇她那一头乌黑的秀发。

“我永远都不想结婚了。”她答道。

他点点头。

“明天一早，我就去华盛顿。”他说。

“哦——”

“我得走了，我得先到纽约，顺便在华盛顿歇歇脚。”

“为了生意！”

“不——不，”他仿佛有点勉为其难的样子，“我必须去那儿看望一个人，在我——穷困潦倒——的时候，他对我恩重如山。”

他在说谎，华盛顿根本没什么人等着他去看望——然而，他用眼角瞄了琼奎尔一眼，他敢断定她轻轻地打了个寒战，将眼睛闭上，又睁大了。

“不过，既然见到你了，我想在我走之前将我的经历讲给你听听。也许我们以后不会再见面了，不知你是否——是否愿意像过去那样坐到我的怀里来——就这一次，好吗？要不是你还没有心上人，否则我是不会向你提出这种要求的——不过——也许，你不愿意，那也没关系。”

她点点头，旋即坐在了他的腿上，像那个一去不复返的春天她常做的那样。她那靠在他肩膀上的头以及她那熟悉的身体立刻为他输入了一股电流，传遍他的全身。拥抱着她的两只胳膊想把她抱得再紧些，于是他把身体向后仰，开始心事重重地对着空气讲起来。

他告诉她，他在纽约度过了两个令人绝望的礼拜，结束了泽西市一家建筑公司的差事，这个工作虽然不怎么赚钱，却也很有吸引力。刚开始的时候，秘鲁的事业也看不出有多好。在这次跨国生意中，他是第三位助理工程师，而美国方面派去库斯科的只有十个人，包括八名标尺手和测量员，他们都从未去过库斯科。十天后，领队死于黄热病，他的机会来了。只要不是傻瓜，对任何人来说，这都是一个天赐良机——

“只要不是傻瓜，对任何人来说，这都是一个天赐良机？”她天真地打断了他的话。

“甚至对傻瓜也不例外，”他继续说，“那就是一个天赐良机。然后，我就给纽约发了电报——”

“所以，”她又打断了他的话，“他们就给你回了电报，说你应该抓住这个机会啰？”

“什么应该呀！”他大声说。他依旧向后仰着身子。“我必须抓住这个机会。机不可失，时不再来——”

“一刻都不能耽搁吗？”

“一刻都不能。”

“甚至没时间——”她打住话头不说了。

“没时间怎么了？”

“看一眼。”

他突然俯首向前，同时，她也将身体靠向他，她的嘴唇像花瓣一样半张着。

“是的，”他悄声说着，吻上了她的唇，“时间总是有的……”

时间总是有的——他的一生，还有她的一生。然而，这一吻让他彻底明白过来，就算他找到地老天荒，也找不回那些遗失了的四月的时光了，找不回那时光里的激情了。此时此刻，他大可紧紧地拥着她，直到胳膊上的肌肉暴突——她是他渴望的，是他珍惜的，是他拼了命都想要得到的——然而，那些飘散在黄昏中，飘散在和风习习的夜空里的喁喁细语再也听不到了……

好吧，让它去吧，他想。四月结束了，结束了。世上的爱情何止千种万种，但从来都没有哪种爱情可以重来。





富家子弟


一


以平凡人物开篇，会意外地塑造一个典型；而以一个典型开篇，塑造的人物最终——什么都不是。那是因为我们都是怪人，我们的音容笑貌下面潜藏着更加奇怪的东西，这些东西我们不希望别人发现，甚至连自己都意识不到。每当我听到有人标榜自己是“正常、诚实、开朗之人”时，我就敢断定他百分之百有一些藏而不露的异常情况，甚至有些可怕的变态——他那正常、诚实、开朗的严正声明只是提醒自己刻意伪装掩饰的一种方式。

这篇小说里既没有典型人物，平凡人物也寥寥无几，只有一个富家子弟，这篇小说就是写他而不是写他的弟弟们的。虽然我和他的弟弟们打了一辈子交道，成为我朋友的就他一人。另外，要是我写的是他的弟弟们，那我就必须戳穿穷人口中关于富人以及富人口中关于他们自己的谎言——这些谎言非常猖獗，以至于当我们随便拿起一本写富人的书，就会不由自主地怀疑它的真实性。即使是别具慧眼、对生活富有探索精神的作家也可能将富人的世界描述得神乎其神。

我来给你们讲讲那些富贾巨商们的事吧，他们和你我有天壤之别。他们从小就腰缠万贯，享尽荣华富贵。这样的生活也对他们产生了影响：在一些事情上，他们软弱，我们执着；他们玩世不恭，我们则充满真诚。从某种程度上来说，除非你生下来就是富人，否则就很难理解。他们在内心深处永远觉得他们好过我们，因为我们不得不靠自己的努力挣口饭来果腹，找个地方来遮风挡雨。即使他们沦落到和我们一样穷的地步，甚至连我们都不如，他们也依然觉得好过我们。他们真是与众不同。我描述年轻的安森·亨特的唯一方法就是去接近他，仿佛他是个外国人，只能由我来代言。如果我一旦接受他的观点，我就会立刻迷失方向——只能束手无策地给你们看一部极其荒谬的电影脚本了。





二


安森兄弟姐妹六人，他是老大，有一天他们会分配价值一千五百万美元的家产。在二十世纪初，当女人们不再羞答答地乘着电动“汽车”在第五大街上招摇过市的时候——安森已经到了懂事的年龄——有七岁了吧？那个时候，他和弟弟有一个英国女家庭教师，她的英语说得非常清晰、利落、优雅，因此，这两个男孩子的说话方式渐渐地变得和她一模一样了——他们的遣词造句都很清晰、利落，不像我们说起话来一气呵成，没个停顿。他们讲话时带有一种纽约市有头有脸的人们所特有的那种腔调，这一点和英国孩子也不完全相同。

夏天，这六个孩子从第七十一大街上的一座房子里搬到康涅狄格州北部的一幢大庄园里。那里不是个时髦的地方——安森的父亲是想尽量延迟孩子们对时尚生活的了解。和构成纽约社交圈的他那些同阶层的人们以及与他所处的那个势利、庸俗观念已经固化了的镀金时代(1)的人们相比，他多少都有些出类拔萃。他希望儿子们养成专一的习惯，身体健康，长大后走上正当的生活道路，成为成功人士。他和妻子尽可能地密切关注着孩子们的成长，直到两个大点的孩子上学为止。然而在这么一个深宅大院里，做到这一点实属不易——要是在我小时候住过的小房子里和不大不小的房子里，就简单多了——我一直都在母亲的眼皮子底下活动，随时都能听到她的声音，感觉到她的存在，听她说行或是不行。

当安森在康涅狄格州的村庄里受到村民们勉强给予他的美国式的敬重时，他最初的优越感便开始形成了。和他一起玩耍的男孩们的父母总是追着他的父母问东问西，而且当他们的孩子受到邀请到亨特家玩耍时，他们就会流露出隐隐约约的兴奋之情。他把这些都当成是自然而然的事情。他对所有在金钱、地位、权威诸方面不把他当成中心人物的群体都怀恨在心，而且终生不忘。他不屑与其他男孩子争夺领导权——他觉得他们应该将领导权无条件地拱手让给他，如若不然，他就缩到家里去。他家很有钱，因为在东部，金钱依然有一定的封建力量，是一个家族赖以形成的基础。而在势利的西部，金钱反倒使一个家族分崩离析，变成各种“小帮派”。

安森十八岁的时候去了纽黑文，由于学校里的规律生活，他高大魁梧，皮肤明亮润泽，气色健康。他长着一头奇怪的黄头发和鹰钩鼻子——这两样东西没能让他进入相貌堂堂的美男子行列——但是他十分自信，这使他魅力不俗，另有一种霸气的风度。上层社会的人们如果在马路上与他擦肩而过，不用谁说他们就知道他是富家子弟，而且在最好的学校受过教育。不过，也正是他给人的这种高高在上的感觉反而使他的大学生活过得不尽如人意——他的独立个性被误认为是妄自尊大，他拒绝以应有的敬意接受耶鲁大学的标准似乎是对那些毕恭毕敬的遵从者的藐视。因此，远还没有毕业，他就开始将生活的重心转移到了纽约。

在纽约，他倒是过得悠游自在——他有属于自己的房子，家里还有“你再也找不到的那种用人”——还有他自己的家人。由于他脾气好，又有一定的处事能力，所以他很快就成为家人的主心骨。他去参加初涉社交圈的名流派对，加入正规的男人俱乐部里那个血气方刚的男人世界，有时也会和那些连纽黑文的主流社会都进不去的轻浮姑娘们尽情狂欢。他的抱负很平凡——其中包括一个无可指责、在他心中秘而不宣的计划：有一天他会结婚。但是他的抱负和大多数年轻人的抱负又有所不同，因为他的抱负不会给人一种雾里看花的感觉，一点都不具有所谓的“理想主义”或“幻想”的成分。安森毫无保留地接受了那个富豪云集、纸醉金迷、离婚成风、放荡不羁、唯利是图、大搞特权的世界。我们大多数人的生活都以妥协而告终——而他的生活则是以妥协而开始。

我和他初次见面是在一九一七年的夏末，当时，他刚好从耶鲁大学毕业。和我们所有人一样，他很快就被卷入了那场大规模的疯狂战争。他穿着海军航空部队蓝绿相间的军装去了彭萨科拉，旅店里的管弦乐队在演奏《对不起，亲爱的》，我们这些年轻军官和姑娘们随着音乐跳舞。尽管他和酒徒们到处跑去喝酒，并不是个特别称职的飞行员，却偏偏人人都喜欢他，连指导员们都敬他几分。他常常自信满满、逻辑清晰地和他们进行长谈——这么一谈，就让他自己，或者更多的时候是让另一个军官摆脱了即将到来的麻烦。他善于交际、爱讲粗话、贪图享乐，当他爱上一个思想保守、中规中矩的姑娘时，我们都感到非常意外。

她叫宝拉·勒让德，是个皮肤黝黑、态度认真的美人，来自加利福尼亚的某个地方。她家在城外有一幢避寒别墅，尽管她循规蹈矩，却非常受人追捧。有一大帮自以为是的男人受不了女人们的脾气，但是安森不是那种人，而我也理解不了她的“真诚”——用这个词来评价她真是恰如其分——对他那种思维敏捷而又有点玩世不恭的人来说究竟有多大的魅力。

尽管如此，他们还是相爱了——而且是他主动追求的她。他不再参加迪索托酒吧的黄昏派对了，只要有人看到他们在一起，他们都在一本正经、没完没了地谈话，好像要几个礼拜才能谈完似的。很久之后，他告诉我，他们的谈话内容没有任何特殊之处，他们两个人的谈话都很幼稚，甚至毫无意义——他们逐渐产生情愫并不是因为说了什么话，而是因为他们在说话时所表现出的极其严肃认真的态度。那是一种催眠剂。他们的这种一本正经劲儿常常被我们所谓的玩笑所搅扰；当他们单独相处的时候，就会重新恢复常态，认真低调，分寸掌握得刚刚好，使彼此在情感和思想上都产生共鸣。他们开始讨厌任何人的打扰，对那种拿生活当儿戏的行为，甚至对当代人的那种轻微的玩世不恭的态度都不理不睬。只要不停地交谈，他们就会感到快乐，那股子认真劲儿使他们沐浴在琥珀色的篝火般的烈焰中。终于，他们发展到被一种他们并不讨厌的东西所搅扰的程度——他们的谈话开始被彼此的激情所打断。

非常奇怪的是，安森和她一样沉浸于谈话中，并和她一样被深深地打动。然而，他同时也意识到，他这方面存在着很大程度的虚情假意，而她那方面很大程度上只是由于太单纯。起初，他也看不上她在感情方面的天真无知，但是有了他的爱，她的性格也变得深刻并充满魅力了，令他再也不敢小觑了。他觉得，如果他能走进宝拉温暖而安稳的生活，他会很幸福的。有了两人漫长的谈话做铺垫，他们之间不再拘谨——他向她传授了一些从更大胆的女人那里学来的东西，她则以一种如痴如醉的圣洁的强烈感情回应他。一天晚上跳完舞后，他们都同意结婚，他写了一封长信把她的情况向母亲做了介绍。第二天，宝拉告诉他，她很有钱，拥有将近一百万美元的个人财产。





三


这种情况的确好像是他们都说“我们俩都一无所有，就在一起受穷吧”——而结果反而令人惊喜，他们都非常富有。这同样给了他们冒险的情感体验。四月份，安森离开的时候，宝拉和她母亲陪他去北方，他家在纽约的地位以及他们的房产规模都给她留下了深刻的印象。第一次单独和安森待在他从小在里面玩耍的房间里，她有一种宾至如归的舒适感，好像特别安全，并感到备受呵护。安森刚上学时的那张戴着骷髅帽的照片，在那个神秘的、已经想不起是哪年夏天照的和小情人骑在马背上的照片，在婚礼上和一群快乐的迎宾员以及女傧相的合照，都使她对未能参与他过去的生活而心生妒意。似乎他背后有一个人，完全有权把他过去的生活进行总结，再把这几个场景作为典型摆在她的面前，促使她恨不得马上嫁给他，让她以妻子的名义回到彭萨科拉去。

但是他们并没有谈及马上结婚的事——就连订婚也要悄悄地进行，战争结束后才能公开。当她意识到再有两天他就要离开的时候，她再也掩饰不住她的不满，她希望他和她一样，迫不及待地想要结婚。他们正驱车去乡下吃晚饭，她决定当晚就想办法逼他亮明态度。

这时候，宝拉的一个表姐和他们一起住在丽兹酒店。她是个刻薄、爱记仇的女孩，她爱宝拉，但又有点嫉妒她那令人艳羡的婚约。宝拉因为要梳妆打扮，所以会迟来一会儿，这位表姐不去参加派对，于是就由她在套房的客厅里接待安森。

五点钟，安森去见了几个朋友，和他们随心所欲地喝了半个小时的酒。他准时离开耶鲁俱乐部，他母亲的司机开车把他送到丽兹酒店。然而他平常那股子神气活现的精神劲儿消失了，再加上客厅里的暖气立刻让他头晕目眩。这一点他能感觉得到，他觉得又好玩又抱歉。

宝拉的表姐二十五岁了，却特别幼稚。一开始，她没看出来是怎么回事。她以前从来没有见过安森，她非常吃惊地听着他咕咕哝哝地说着胡话，看着他几乎从椅子上摔下去。但是直到宝拉出来的时候，她才明白，她原以为是他的军装干洗后残留的气味实际上却是威士忌的味道。不过，宝拉一出来就明白是怎么回事了，她只想趁母亲还没有看见，赶快把他弄走，表姐从她的眼神里也看出了这一点。

宝拉和安森下了楼，来到那辆豪华轿车旁，却发现里面坐着两个人，都睡着了。他们刚才和安森一起在耶鲁俱乐部里喝酒，也要去参加派对。他把他们俩还在车上这件事忘得干干净净。在去汉普斯泰德的路上，他们俩醒了，开始唱起歌来。有几首歌很粗俗，好在安森没说什么丢脸的话，宝拉才勉力克制住自己，尽管如此，她还是由于难堪和厌恶而紧紧地闭着嘴巴。

表姐回到酒店，又困惑又生气，把这件事又想了一遍，然后走进勒让德太太的卧室，说道：“他是不是很可笑？”

“谁很可笑啊？”

“哦——是亨特先生。他看起来很可笑。”

勒让德太太目光凌厉地看着她。

“他怎么可笑了啊？”

“呃，他说他是法国人。我以前可没听说过他是法国人。”

“胡说，你一定是听错了。”她笑着说，“那是句玩笑话吧。”

表姐固执地摇摇头。

“不是玩笑话。他说他在法国长大，连一句英语也不会说，所以他不能和我谈话。而且他的确不能！”

勒让德太太生气地将脸扭到一边，偏偏在这个时候，表姐若有所思地加了句：“也许是因为他醉得不成样子了吧。”说罢便走出了房间。

这通莫名其妙的话说得倒是事实。安森意识到自己声音含混不清，又控制不住自己，就找了个莫名其妙的借口，声称自己不会说英语。几年后，他还常常讲起这件事，而且只要想起这件事，他就忍不住放声大笑。

在接下来的一个小时内，勒让德太太打了五次电话，汉普斯泰德那边都没有人接听。最后终于打通了，可是等了十分钟，她才在电话里听到宝拉的声音。

“你乔表姐对我说，安森喝醉了。”

“哦，他没……”

“嗯，他是醉了。你乔表姐说他醉了。他对她说他是法国人，还从椅子上摔倒了，看样子他还醉得不轻呢。我不希望你和他一起回来。”

“妈妈，他没事的！请不要担心——”

“可是我的确很担心啊。而且我觉得糟糕透了。希望你答应我，别和他一起回来。”

“我会小心的，妈妈……”

“我不许你把他带回来。”

“好吧，妈妈。再见。”

“听着，宝拉，你务必答应我，找个人送你回来。”

宝拉故意把话筒从耳边拿开，挂断了电话。她因为无计可施而急得满脸通红。安森直挺挺地躺在楼上的卧室里，而楼下的晚宴派对在别别扭扭的气氛中接近了尾声。

一个小时的车程让他清醒了许多——他的到来只不过是一场闹剧——宝拉原本只是希望不要破坏了晚上的气氛，然而晚饭前他又不知轻重地喝了两杯鸡尾酒，最终酿成了这不可收拾的局面。他唐突无理地当着众人大声嚷嚷了一刻钟的时间，然后一声不吭地瘫倒到桌子下面去了。他像是一幅老版画中的一个人物——可是又不像是一幅老版画，因为他的样子很糟糕，没有一点斯文古雅的感觉。来参加晚宴的姑娘们没有人对此事评头论足——只有沉默以对。他叔叔和另外两个男人把他抬到楼上，他刚被弄到楼上，宝拉就被电话叫走了。

一个小时后，安森感到浑身难受，迷迷糊糊地醒来了，过了一会儿，他模模糊糊地看见罗伯特叔叔的身影站在门口。

“——我说，你好点了吗？”

“什么？”

“您老觉得好点了吗？”

“糟透了。”安森说道。

“我准备再给你弄一杯苏打水，里面放些镇静剂。你喝下去试试看，这有助于睡眠。”

安森费力地将腿从床上挪了下来，站起身。

“我没事。”他醉醺醺地说道。

“放松点。”

“我说，你能不能给我拿杯白兰地，我想到楼下去。”

“哦，这可不行——”

“没事，只能喝点白兰地解解闷了，我现在没事了……我想，楼下的人肯定都不想见我了。”

“他们知道你有点不舒服，”他叔叔言不由衷地说，“不过别担心，斯凯勒甚至都没来，他在高尔夫球场的衣帽间里消磨时间呢。”

他只在乎宝拉的想法，其他人怎么想他都无所谓。尽管他下定决心挽回晚上的残局，但是当他冲了个凉水澡露面的时候，参加派对的人大部分都已经走了。宝拉立刻起身回家。

在豪华轿车里，他们又开始像以前那样一本正经地聊起来。她承认她知道他喝多了，但是她怎么也想不到事情会弄成这样——她觉得他们也许根本就不合适。他们的人生观差别太大，诸如此类，不一而足。她说完了，轮到安森说话了，他已经很清醒了。然后，宝拉接着说，她得好好考虑考虑；今天晚上她不能做出决定；她不是生气，她只是特别遗憾。她也不让他和她一起进酒店，但是在下车之前，她把身子靠过来，一脸不高兴地在他的面颊上吻了一下。

第二天下午，安森和勒让德太太进行了一次长谈，宝拉坐在旁边默默地倾听着。她的意见是，让宝拉对这件事再仔细考虑一段时间，然后，如果母女俩都觉得这是最好的选择，她们就会跟随安森去彭萨科拉。安森这方面，他真诚而不失尊严地表达了歉意——仅此而已；勒让德太太打出了手中的每一张牌，也没能在气势上占据上风。他不做承诺，不卑不亢，最后只是郑重其事地发表了几句对人生的看法，最终以压倒性的精神优势大功告成。三个礼拜后，当她们来到南方时，对于他们的重归于好，安森感到心满意足，宝拉感到如释重负，然而他们谁也没有意识到，他们在心灵上的契合与共鸣已经一去不复返了。

他主导着她，吸引着她，同时给予她满腹疑虑。他是多重性格的混合体：既稳健，又放纵；既多愁善感，又玩世不恭，把她搞得晕头转向。她温顺的大脑理解不了他性格当中的多重矛盾——宝拉渐渐地意识到，他具有双重人格，而且在这双重人格之间变幻不定。他独处时，参加正式的社交派对时，或者在下属面前时，她都能看到他坚强迷人的表现以及他父亲般的宽厚和敏锐的理解力，为此她感到莫大的骄傲；而在其他场合，他又完全不顾斯文，表现出他的另一面，这又让她觉得很不安。他的另一面粗俗、风趣，对什么都满不在乎，只知道贪图享乐。这让她吃惊不已，使她决定暂时将注意力从他身上移开，甚至悄悄地和过去的一个老情人尝试着交往了一阵子，但是依然无济于事——在被安森的活力包围了四个月后，其他所有男人都变得像患上了贫血症似的面无血色，苍白无力。

七月份，他奉命前往国外，他们愈发缠绵悱恻。宝拉考虑在他出发前的最后一刻结婚——但是最后又决定不结婚了，就因为现在他的呼吸里总是散发着鸡尾酒的味道，然而分别本身又使她悲伤成疾。他走后，她给他写了一封封长信，为他们因为等待而错失了这么多天的恩爱而惋惜。八月份，安森乘坐的飞机坠入北海。在水里浸泡了一夜后，他被拖上一艘驱逐舰上，因为患了肺炎而被送往医院。停战协议签署后，他终于被送回国内。

然后，他们拥有了失而复得的机会，也不需要克服什么障碍，然而，他们的性格又开始悄悄地在他们之间起作用。渐渐地，他们不再亲吻，也不再流泪，对彼此说话时，声音的分量也渐渐变弱变轻了，也不再倾心交谈了，最后只能靠遥寄书信这一种方式来维持往日的情分了。一天下午，为了证实他们已经订婚了，一名社会报记者在亨特家等了两个小时要亲自采访安森。尽管此前有报纸将此事作为头版头条进行了报道——人们“总是看到他们一起出现在南汉普顿、温泉城和塔克西多”，但是安森还是否认了这件事。严肃认真的交流变成长期不断的争吵，他们的恋情差不多已经结束了。后来，安森不可原谅地喝醉了酒而错过了和她的约会，宝拉因此对他提出了一些行为方面的要求。由于自尊心太强和一向的自以为是，他彻底绝望了，他们的婚约也就彻底破裂了。

“最最亲爱的，”如今他们在信上说，“最最亲爱的，最最亲爱的，当我夜间醒来，意识到事情无可挽回，我简直不想活了。我活不下去了。也许今年夏天，我们见面的时候，还可以再好好谈谈，可能会做出不同的决定——那天我们太激动、太伤心了，我觉得我这辈子不能没有你。你说我心里有别人了，可是难道你还不知道，我心里除了你，根本没有别人……”

但是当宝拉在东部随意闲逛的时候，她偶尔会提到她的各种赏心乐事，以便引起他的遐想。安森太聪明，根本不会胡思乱想。当他看到她的信中有一个男人名字的时候，他就更加吃定她了，还产生了些许鄙视之意——在这种事情上他总是高高在上的。不过他还是希望有一天他们会结婚。

与此同时，他兴致勃勃地投身于战后纽约的各种活动和充满诱惑的生活之中。他进入一家证券公司，加入了六个俱乐部，跳舞到深更半夜，还活跃在三个社交圈里——他自己的那个，年轻的耶鲁大学毕业生和那一头靠着百老汇的半个圈子。但是，他每天还总是老老实实、兢兢业业地在华尔街工作八个小时。在华尔街，由于他那富有影响力的家庭关系，他那出类拔萃的个人才华以及旺盛的精力，几乎是一夜之间他就干得风生水起，事业如日中天了。他拥有无比宝贵的条分缕析的思维；有时候睡眠不足一个小时，他依然可以神清气爽地出现在办公室里，不过这种情况非常少。因此，早在一九二〇年，他的月薪和佣金就达到了一万两千多美元。

随着耶鲁大学的传统渐渐过时，在纽约的同学中，他越来越受人追捧，比他上大学的时候风光多了。他住在一幢大房子里，并且有办法将年轻人介绍到其他人的大房子里去。此外，他的生活似乎已经很安稳，而那些年轻人中，大部分人的生活则又重新回到了岌岌可危的境地。于是，他们纷纷投靠他，或为了消遣，或为了逃避，安森总是有求必应。他乐于助人，并乐于为他们的感情问题出谋划策。

如今宝拉的信中不出现男人的名字了，取而代之的是，信文里贯穿着一种前所未有的柔情蜜意。他听几个人说，她有“一个非常痴情的情郎”，洛厄尔·塞耶，一个有钱有势的波士顿人，虽然他能肯定她依然爱他，但是这件事还是让他感到不安，他想他可能要失去她了。除了那令人扫兴的一天外，她差不多有五个月都不到纽约来了。传言铺天盖地，他越来越急于见她。二月份，他趁着休假，去了佛罗里达。

像蓝宝石一样闪闪发光的沃斯湖上随处点缀着一艘艘豪华游艇，在沃斯湖和巨大的、天蓝色的飘带似的大西洋之间，延伸着丰腴肥美的棕榈滩(2)。气势雄伟的布里克斯酒店和皇家普林斯顿酒店就像两个大腹便便的双胞胎傲立在明亮的沙滩地平线上，周围簇拥着葛雷德舞厅、布雷德利赌场和十多家女时装店和女帽店，里面货物的价格是纽约的三倍。在布里克斯酒店的空中走廊上，有两百个女人在那里跳舞。她们右踏步，左踏步，旋转，滑步，那是当时著名的健美操，叫作“双曳步”。与此同时，两百只胳膊随着音乐上下舞动，胳膊上的两千只镯子丁丁零零一片脆响。

黄昏后，在大湿地公园俱乐部，宝拉、洛厄尔·塞耶和安森又随便找了个人，凑成四个人，用当时非常流行的一种牌打桥牌。安森似乎觉得她那善良、严肃的脸庞憔悴而倦怠——到目前为止，她在这里已经晃荡了四五年了，而他认识她也有三年了。

“一对黑桃。”

“香烟？……哦，不好意思，我过。”

“过。”

“我出三个黑桃对子。”

房间里有十几桌人在打桥牌，里面搞得乌烟瘴气。安森迎着宝拉的目光直直地看去，尽管塞耶定定地看着他们俩，他们依然旁若无人地对视着……

“叫的什么牌？”他神情恍惚地问道。

华盛顿广场上的玫瑰花

坐在角落里的那个年轻人唱道：

我正在凋零啊，

在那地窖的空气里——

屋子里的烟越来越多，像化不开的浓雾。开门的时候，烟雾被风吹得像漩涡一样打着转。一双亮晶晶的小眼睛，电光似的从一张张桌子上面嗖嗖飞过，从大厅里那些端着英国人架子的英国人中寻找柯南·道尔(3)先生。

“你应该用刀砍。”

“……用刀砍。”

“……用刀。”

在这场决定胜负的牌局结束的时候，宝拉猛然起身，用低沉激动的声音对安森说了句什么。他们几乎连看都没看洛厄尔·塞耶一眼，便走出门，下了长长的石阶——不失时机地牵起对方的手，在洒满月光的沙滩上散起步来。

“亲爱的，亲爱的……”他们不管不顾、热情似火地在一处阴影里拥抱在一起……然后，宝拉把脸挣脱开来，好让他的嘴唇说出她期待已久的那句话——他们又开始亲吻起来，她感到那句话已经到他的嘴边了……她再次挣脱开来，等待着。然而，当他再次将她拥入怀中的时候，她发现他一个字也没说——他只是用深情、忧伤得让她想哭的声音喃喃说着：“亲爱的！亲爱的！”她卑微顺从地将自己的情感交付于他，泪水顺着面颊倾泻而下，然而她的心还在呐喊：“求婚啊——安森，最最亲爱的，向我求婚啊！”

“宝拉……宝拉！”

这些字眼就像是用手在撕扯她的心，安森感觉到她在颤抖，他知道，感情到这种程度就已经足够了。他无须再说什么，无须把他们的命运托付给没有实际意义的虚妄之语。既然他可以这样拥有她，那么他为什么还要再等一年呢——为什么要永远等下去呢？他在为他们两人着想，而更多的是在为她着想。但是，她突然说她得回酒店去了，他犹豫了片刻，脑海里闪出的第一个念头是：“现在正是时候，”转而又想，“不，再等等吧，她早晚都是我的……”

他忘了，在这三年中，宝拉的内心备受煎熬，她已经疲惫不堪了。那个夜晚，宝拉对他的感情永远成为过去式了。

第二天上午，他回纽约去，内心充满了难以名状的烦躁和愁绪。他认识的一名初涉社交圈的漂亮女孩，她搭他的车一同去纽约，两天来，他们都在一起进餐。刚开始，他给她讲了一点宝拉的事，还瞎说什么他们因为合不来才弄得分了手，还说这可是不能让别人知道的秘密。这个女孩性格冲动，放荡不羁，她因为安森向她袒露心迹而受宠若惊。像吉卜林的士兵似的，在到达纽约前，他就可以占有她，但是幸好他很清醒，他控制住了自己。四月末，他在毫无预兆的情况下收到一封宝拉从巴港发来的电报，电报上说，她和洛厄尔·塞耶订婚了，而且马上准备在波士顿完婚。他从来都不相信真的会发生的事情终于发生了。

那天上午，安森灌了一肚子威士忌，到办公室后，一刻不停地埋头干活——唯恐一停下来就会发生什么事似的。晚上，他一如既往地出门，对发生的事只字不提；他热情、幽默、神情专注。但是有一件事他控制不了——三天来，无论在什么地方，无论和谁在一起，他都会突然双手抱头，像个孩子似的痛哭流涕。

一九二二年，安森和一个助手一起去伦敦调查几笔贷款，这次出差意味着他将被这家公司录用。他现在已经二十七岁了，有点发福，但还称不上肥胖，比他的实际年龄显得老成。不管是老年人还是年轻人都喜欢他、信任他，母亲们把女儿托付给他也很放心。因为他有一套办法，当他走进一间屋子的时候，总是和最年长、最保守的人待在一起。“我和你们，”他好像在说，“我们都很可靠，我们心照不宣。”

他对男人和女人的弱点怀有一种天生的悲悯的态度，这使他像牧师一样更加注意维护自己的外在形象。比如，每个礼拜天上午，他都在一所紧跟潮流的圣公会主日学校授课——哪怕他只是在一夜疯狂之后匆匆冲个冷水澡，换上一套燕尾服，让自己迅速改头换面而已，但这就是他的行事风格。有一次，出于双方的一时冲动，几个孩子从前面几排的座位上挪到最后一排，他常常讲起这件事，往往都会引起人们的哄堂大笑。

他父亲去世后，他实际上成了一家之主，实际上也成了弟弟妹妹们人生的引路人。由于某些复杂的原因，他未能接管父亲创下的家业，而是由他叔叔罗伯特来接管了。罗伯特叔叔是这个家族的赛马运动员，脾气好，爱喝酒，以惠特利山区为活动中心。

罗伯特叔叔和他的妻子艾德娜曾经是安森年轻时的好朋友。叔叔对侄子因为优越感而不肯成为赛马运动员感到失望。他支持他加入了一个美国最难加入的城市俱乐部——只有曾经“帮助缔造纽约”的家族成员才能加入（或者，换句话说，只有在一八八〇年前就富起来的家族成员才可加入）——可安森在入选之后，却为了耶鲁俱乐部而忽略了这个俱乐部，罗伯特叔叔因为此事还和他谈了一次话。除此之外，安森还拒绝到罗伯特自己开的那家保守并在一定程度上没有得到好好管理的证券公司工作，他变得越来越淡漠。就这样，罗伯特叔叔就像一个倾其所能的小学老师一样，渐渐淡出了安森的生活。

安森的一生朋友简直太多了——几乎没有一个朋友没有得到过他非同寻常的帮助，也几乎没有一个朋友不因为他那突然爆出的粗口或不分时间、场合，随心所欲地喝醉酒的习惯而难堪过。然而，当别人在这些方面出错时，他却感到非常生气——而对于自己的过失，他总表现得富有幽默感。他要是碰到了什么莫名其妙的怪事，他就用富有感染力的声音笑着讲给他们听。

那年春天，我在纽约工作，常常和他一起在耶鲁俱乐部吃午餐。当时，我的大学和他们的大学共享一个俱乐部，直到我们的大学也建立了自己的俱乐部。我看到过宝拉结婚的消息。一天下午，我向他问起宝拉的情况，有些东西触动了他，他才给我讲起他们的故事。从此以后，他就常常邀我去他家吃饭，弄得我们之间好像有什么特殊关系一样，似乎他把心事告诉了我，我就拥有了一点他那刻骨铭心的回忆似的。

我发现，尽管母亲们很信任他，他对姑娘们的态度并不是一味地加以保护。这取决于姑娘自身——如果她表现出随便的倾向，那么即使是和他在一起，她也必须自己多加小心。

“生活，”他有时会解释说，“把我变成了一个玩世不恭的人。”

他所说的生活指的是宝拉。有时候，特别是当他喝酒的时候，他的想法就会变得有点扭曲。他认为她是个铁石心肠的人，她把他抛弃了。

这种“玩世不恭”的态度，或者更确切地说，他潜意识里觉得天生轻浮的女孩不值得珍惜，才促成了他和多丽·卡尔格的那段情感经历。这段情感经历在那些年间并不是唯一的，但给他的触动最为深刻，而且对他的生活态度也产生了深远的影响。

多丽的父亲是一位靠政治联姻上位的、臭名昭著的“政论家”。她本人长大后加入了一个女青年会(4)，在广场酒店出入，并且成为州议会议员。只有像亨特家这样的几个古老家族才有资格质疑她的“家世背景”，因为她的照片经常刊登在报纸上，比起那些毫无疑问引人注目的女孩，她得到的关注更令人羡慕。她黑发，红唇，肤色红润，妩媚可爱。她步入社会的第一年，脸上总是涂着一层灰蒙蒙的红粉，把她本来的红润脸色盖住，因为当年流行的肤色是维多利亚式的苍白——她的肤色不流行。她穿着庄重的黑色套装，双手插在衣袋里站立着，身体微微前倾，表情风趣而矜持。她的舞姿优美——她喜欢跳舞胜过一切——当然，谈恋爱除外。她从十岁就开始一直不断地谈恋爱，通常都是和某个对她不感兴趣的男孩谈。那些对她感兴趣的男孩——而且这样的男孩居多——经过短暂的相处后，她就腻烦了，她要是不遭遇挫折，内心就激发不出爱情的火焰。当她见到他们的时候，她总是愿意再尝试一次——有时候她能成功，但更多的时候，她都失败了。

这个可望而不可即的吉卜赛姑娘从未想到过，那些拒绝爱她的男孩和她有某种程度的相似——他们也有敏锐的直觉，能够看穿她的弱点，不是感情方面的弱点，而是喜欢受制于人的弱点。宝拉婚后还不到一个月的时间，安森第一次见到多丽时就看破了这一点。他喝得酩酊大醉，有一个礼拜，他假装爱上她了。然后他突然把她甩掉，把她忘得干干净净——他立刻就在她心中占据了支配地位。

和那个时代的很多女孩一样，多丽行为随便轻率，放荡不羁。年龄稍大的那代人与传统格格不入的思想只是战后反对陈规陋习的运动所体现出的一个方面而已——多丽与传统格格不入的想法则更老套，更愚蠢。她看到了安森身上的两个极端：既可以不顾一切地享乐，又有呵护人的能力。这正是这个在感情上得过且过的女人所梦寐以求的，他的贪图安逸和坚如磐石正好满足了她天性中的每一个需要。

她觉得事情很难办，但是她搞错了原因——她以为安森和他的家族希望缔结一个更加风光的婚姻。然而，她立刻意识到他对酒的嗜好便是她的可乘之机。

他们是在一场为初涉社交界的名媛们举办的盛大舞会上遇见的，但是她对他越来越痴迷，他们就想办法尽可能地待在一起。和大多数母亲一样，卡尔格太太也认为安森很可靠，因此她允许多丽和他一起去遥远的乡村俱乐部，也允许他带她去郊区的别墅里，也不详细盘问他们的活动。如果他们回来得很晚，她对多丽的解释也没有产生什么怀疑。一开始，她可能还实事求是地向母亲汇报，但是多丽想要俘获安森的庸俗想法不久就被越来越强烈的激情淹没了。在出租车和汽车后座上亲吻已经无法满足他们的欲望，他们便干了一件不可思议的事情。

他们暂时退出了他们所属的那个引人注目的上层社会的社交圈，而融入了一个仅次于上流社会的社交圈子。在这个圈子里，安森可以喝得东歪西倒，多丽也不必按时回家，因为没有什么人关注他们，也没有什么人对他们评头论足。这个圈子里什么人都有——安森的几个耶鲁校友以及他们的妻子，两三个年轻的证券经纪人和证券销售人员，几个刚毕业、有钱也会花钱的未婚男人。这个圈子在广度和规模上存在不足，却给了他们几乎超出圈子本身所容许的自由，从而弥补了这个不足。另外，他们是这个圈子里的中心人物，这多少让多丽产生了一些高高在上的快乐——而安森的整个人生，从孩提时代开始，就一直处于这种高高在上的状态中，所以他已经无法从中体会到这种快乐了。

他并不爱她，在那个漫长的激情四射的冬季里，他常常这样告诉她。到了春天，他已经厌倦了——他想换一种方式，呼吸些新鲜空气——而且他也意识到，他要么马上和她分手，要么就承担起他那绝对属于引诱他人的行为所引发的责任。她家人的纵容态度促使他提前下定了决心——一天晚上，卡尔格先生小心地敲开书房的门，声称他把一瓶白兰地忘在餐厅里了，安森觉得他已经被生活捆绑了。那天晚上，他给她写了一封短笺，通知她，他要去度假，而且鉴于各种原因，他们最好不要再见面了。

那是六月份发生的事。他全家锁了大门到乡下去了，因此他暂时住在耶鲁俱乐部。我了解他和多丽的感情发展——他的叙述里夹杂着幽默的成分，因为他看不上水性杨花的女人，绝不会让她们在他所信奉的社交大厦中有立锥之地。那天晚上，当他对我说，他要彻底和她分手的时候，我感到很高兴。我常常碰见多丽，对于她那种无望的挣扎，我总是感到很同情，对于了解她这么多我根本无权知道的隐私，我也总是感到羞耻。她是人们心目中的“小可爱”，她身上的那种不管不顾的劲头还挺令我着迷。但她要是不那么不管不顾的话，她对浪费女神的奉献还不至于那么多——她是注定要将自己奉献出去的。但是当我听说她的献祭不会在我的眼皮底下完成的时候，我高兴极了。

安森准备第二天早上把那封分手信放到她家里。在第五大街这个片区内，仅有几户人家是不关闭门户的，她家就是其中之一。他知道卡尔格夫妇基于从多丽那里得到的错误信息而做出了安排，为了给女儿创造机会，他们已经提前出国旅行了。当他跨出耶鲁俱乐部的大门，走到麦迪逊大街的时候，一个邮差从他身边走过，于是他就跟着邮差折了回来，他一眼就瞥见那第一封信是多丽的笔迹。

他知道信里写的是什么——孤独悲戚的独白，充满了他了然于胸的责备，能想起来的各种回忆以及那些“我不知道是否”之类的话语——所有的那些几乎无法追忆的私密情话好像是他在另一个世纪里同宝拉·勒让德说过的。他翻看了几张票据，然后重新把那封信放到最上面，并把它打开。令他吃惊的是，这是一张简短并且多少有点正式的便条，上面说，这个周末多丽不能和他一起去乡下了，因为派瑞·哈尔突然从芝加哥来城里造访。上面还说，是安森自己造成了这种局面：“——如果我能感受到你像我爱你一样爱我的话，我会随时随地跟你走，但是派瑞太好了，而且他非常非常希望我嫁给他——”

安森轻蔑地笑了——这种套路他太熟悉了。而且，他还知道多丽是如何挖空心思想出这一招的。很可能，她派人去通知对她痴心不改的派瑞，并算好了他到达的时间——她不惜炮制出这样一封短笺来激发他的嫉妒，而又能留住他，不至于把他赶走。和大多数退而求其次的花招一样，她这一招既没有分量，也不会产生什么效力，只是暴露了她那怯懦的绝望。

他突然生气了。他坐在大厅里又将这封短笺看了一遍，然后，他走到电话机旁，拨通了多丽的电话，用他那清晰霸道的声音告诉她，他已经收到她的信，他会按照之前做好的安排在五点钟去拜访她。几乎不等她装出一副犹豫的样子说出“也许我可以抽出一个小时和你见面”这句话，他就撂下话筒，去办公室了。路上，他将自己写的那封信撕得粉碎，扔到了大街上。

他不是嫉妒——对他而言，她无足轻重——但是她那愚蠢又可怜的小把戏，将他内心深处那冥顽不化、自我陶醉的一面都勾了出来。那是在精神上处于劣势的人的一种痴心妄想，他要给她点颜色看看。要是她真想知道她到底属于谁，那么就让她拭目以待吧。

五点一刻，他来到多丽家门口。多丽正在梳妆打扮，准备去逛街。他不动声色地听她说完曾经在电话里开了个头的那句话：“我只有一个小时的时间和你见面。”

“戴上帽子，多丽，”他说，“我们去散散步。”

他们沿着麦迪逊大街走到第五大街，这时，安森由于发福而燥热难耐，身上的衬衫已经潮湿了。他几乎不说话，他是在责怪她，他在表示他不爱她。但是还没走过六个街区，她就又是他的人了。她为那封信道歉，她答应再也不见派瑞了，为了赎罪，她什么都答应。她以为既然他来了，就说明他开始爱她了。

“我很热，”当他们走到第七十一大街时，他说道，“我穿的是冬天的衣服。我回去换下衣服，你不介意在楼下等我一会儿吧？很快就好。”

她很开心；他身体发热，他身体的任何反应，这样私密的信息都让她感到兴奋。他们来到铁栅栏大门前，安森掏出钥匙，她又体验到一种快乐。

楼下很暗，当他乘着电梯上楼的时候，多丽撩起一道帘子，透过半透明的薄纱帘，她能看见走廊对面的一个个房间。她听见电梯停了，怀着逗逗他的想法，她按下了电梯的下行按钮。然后，她凭着不仅仅是冲动的一股子劲头，钻进电梯，上了估计是他所在的那层楼。

“安森。”她小声地笑着叫了一声。

“请稍等。”他从卧室里答道。然后，过了一小会儿，他又说：“现在，你可以进来了。”

他已经换好衣服，正在扣马甲的扣子。“这是我的房间，”他轻松地说，“感觉怎么样？”

她看见墙上挂着宝拉的照片，出神地盯着这张照片看，就像五年前宝拉盯着安森的那些儿时的小情人一样。她了解宝拉的一些事情——有时候，她会用关于宝拉的一些片段来折磨自己。

突然，她靠近安森，举起双臂。他们拥抱在一起。尽管太阳依然灿烂地悬在马路对面的房顶后面，但是透过窗户，外面的天色已经变得很柔和，造成了夜幕降临的假象。半个小时后，房间就会完全黑暗下来，一个出乎意料的机会把他们两个都征服了，使他们喘不过气来，他们抱得更紧了。这种情况谁都明白，是不可避免的。他们依然紧紧拥抱着抬起头——两人的目光同时落在宝拉的照片上，她在墙上俯视着他们。

安森猛然垂下双臂，坐到桌子旁，用一串钥匙一把一把地试着打开一个抽屉。

“想喝一杯吗？”他声音沙哑地问。

“不，安森。”

他给自己倒了半杯威士忌，一饮而尽，然后打开门，走进客厅。

“快点。”他说。

多丽迟疑着。

“安森——今晚我还是打算跟你去乡下的，你明白的，是吗？”

“当然明白。”他唐突地答道。

乘坐多丽的车，他们一路直奔长岛。他们在感情上达到了从未有过的亲近。他们知道即将会发生什么——只要没有宝拉的面容来提醒他们之间缺少了什么，只要他们能够静静地待在一起，哪怕长岛的夜再炎热，他们也不会在乎的。

他们打算到华盛顿港的那幢别墅度周末。这处房产属于安森的一个表姐，她嫁给了一个蒙大拿的铜商。通往这幢别墅的车程很远，再七拐八弯地穿过一片进口的杨树苗圃，便来到那幢巨大的、粉红色的、西班牙风格的别墅。安森以前常到这里来玩。

晚饭后，他们到林克斯俱乐部跳舞。大约到午夜，安森肯定表姐和她的丈夫两点前不会离开——就解释说多丽累了；他想先把她送回去，然后再回到舞厅。他们兴奋得微微颤抖，借了一辆车，一起钻进去，朝华盛顿港开去。他们开到别墅前，停下车子问值夜的守门人：

“你什么时候去巡夜，卡尔？”

“马上就去。”

“那么，你会一直守在这里等着每个人都回来啰？”

“是的，先生。”

“很好，听着，如果有汽车，不管是谁的，开进大门，我希望你立刻给屋里通个电话。”他往卡尔的手里塞了一张五美元的钞票，“明白我的意思吗？”

“明白，安森先生。”由于来自欧洲，守门人既没有朝他们挤眼睛，也没有露出调皮的笑容。然而，多丽坐在那儿还是把脸扭到一边去了。

安森有房门的钥匙，进屋后，他给他们各自倒了一杯酒——多丽没碰那杯酒——然后他又确定了一下电话的位置，他发现电话离他们住的两个房间都不远，很容易听到。他们都住在一楼。

五分钟后，他敲响了多丽的房门。

“安森吗？”他走进去，关上房门。她躺在床上，用胳膊肘支着身子，紧张地靠在枕头上。他坐在她身边，将她拥入怀中。

“安森，亲爱的。”

他没有应声。

“安森……安森！我爱你……你说你爱我。现在就说吧——难道现在你还说不出口吗？哪怕敷衍一下也不行吗？”

他没有听她说话。他的目光越过她的头顶，看见了墙上宝拉的照片。

他站起来，走到照片旁，相框在明亮的月光映照下泛着微光，里面有一张影影绰绰的脸，这张脸他不认识。他几乎是泣不成声地转过身，厌恶地看着床上那个渺小的身体。

“简直愚蠢透了，”他喘着粗气说，“我不知道我在想什么。我不爱你，你最好等一个爱你的人。我一点都不爱你，难道你不明白吗？”

他的声音嘶哑了，他匆匆地走出房间，回到客厅，用颤抖的手给自己倒了一杯酒。这时，大门突然打开了，表姐走了进来。

“嗨，安森，听说多丽病了，”她关切地说，“我听说她病了……”

“没什么事，”他提高嗓门打断了表姐的话，以便让多丽听到，“她只是有点累，已经睡下了。”

这件事过去很久之后，安森依然相信，保护神有时候会干涉人们的感情。但是多丽·卡尔格睁着眼睛躺在床上，盯着天花板，再也不相信任何事情了。





六


第二年秋天，多丽结婚的时候，安森在伦敦出差。像宝拉一样，她也是闪婚。不过她的闪婚对他的影响可不能同宝拉相提并论。一开始，他觉得很滑稽，一想起这事就想笑。后来，他又感到很沮丧——他觉得自己老了。

这像是某种循环——因为，宝拉和多丽属于不同的两代人。他有一种四十岁的男人听说老情人的女儿结婚了的感觉。他打电话表示祝贺。和宝拉的情况不同，他对多丽的祝福是真心诚意的——而对宝拉的幸福，他从来都没有真正地心存希望。

他回到纽约之后成了公司的合伙人，而且随着他所承担的责任越来越大，他个人的时间越来越少。人寿保险公司拒绝给他签发保单，使他受到很大震动，他戒了一年酒，声称他感觉他的身体好多了。可是我还是觉得，在他二十岁刚出头时对他产生重大影响的那种纵情欢乐、奇遇不断的生活，他还是念念不忘的。不过，他永远也不放弃耶鲁俱乐部。他是那里的一个重要人物，一个名人，代表着他那个班级的潮流。他们已经毕业七年了，不想再过那种声色犬马的生活了，他们经常光顾一些避免饮酒的地方，他们的行为因为他的存在而得到限制。

他的日程从来都不会排得太满，精神也不会太疲惫，所以他总是有求必应。一开始，他这样做是出于骄傲和优越感，久而久之，则变成了一种习惯和一种激情。而且总是有各种问题需要他去解决——一个小兄弟在纽黑文遇到了麻烦啦，一个朋友突然和妻子吵架啦，要帮助这个人找一份合适的差事啦，要为那个人做一笔投资啦，等等。但是，他的主要精力是为已婚的年轻人解决问题。已婚的年轻人很令他着迷——他们的公寓对他来说几乎是神圣之地——他了解他们的爱情故事，建议他们在哪里生活，怎样生活，记得他们的孩子叫什么名字。他对年轻的妻子们的态度非常谨慎：他从不辜负她们的丈夫始终如一地给予他的信任——由于他之前那尽人皆知的不当行为，他这样做非常令人奇怪。

他渐渐地能从幸福婚姻中间接地体验到快乐，而那些感情不和的夫妻则会让他产生简直是等同于快乐的愁绪。几乎每个季节他都要目睹一场失败的恋爱，他对恋爱中的两个人也许曾经给予过父亲般的关怀。宝拉离婚后几乎马上又嫁给了另一个波士顿人的时候，他向我讲起她，讲了整整一个下午。他再也不会像爱宝拉一样去爱任何人了，但是他坚持认为他已经不在乎了。

“我永远都不会结婚了，”他说，“我见得太多了，我知道幸福的婚姻是少之又少的。另外，我也这么大年纪了。”

然而，他的确相信婚姻。像所有拥有美满婚姻的男人一样，他热情地信仰婚姻——他的所见所闻丝毫改变不了他的信仰，他的玩世不恭像空气一样消散殆尽。但是，他又的确觉得自己太老了。二十八岁的时候，他开始平静地接受没有浪漫爱情的婚姻观；他毅然决然地选择了一位和他同一阶层的纽约姑娘。她漂亮机智，与他意气相投，无可挑剔——他开始去爱她。他曾经情真意切地对宝拉说过的话，在对其他女孩说时，则是怀着慈悲心肠，笑容可掬，令人深信不疑。

“等我四十岁的时候，”他对朋友们说，“我就成熟了，我会像爱其他姑娘一样去爱一个合唱团的姑娘。”

尽管如此，他仍然坚持去尝试。他母亲希望看到他结婚，而他现在的经济能力养家糊口是绰绰有余的——他在股票交易所拥有一个席位，每年的工资收入达到两万五千美元。结婚的想法令人愉快：因为当他的朋友们——他的大部分时间都花在他和多丽共同结交的那些朋友身上——夜晚关起门休息了的时候，他不再因为获得了自由而感到高兴。他甚至不知道他当时是否应该和多丽结婚。即使是宝拉也不比多丽更爱他，他开始渐渐地明白，一个人在单身的时候，遇到一份真爱是多么的珍贵。

他开始沉浸在这种心情之中的时候，一个令人震惊的消息传到了他的耳朵里。他的婶婶艾德娜，一个将近四十岁的女人，公然与一个名叫凯瑞·斯隆的年轻人鬼混，而这个人行为放荡，酗酒成性。这件事，除了安森的叔叔罗伯特，人人都知道。罗伯特十五年来长期泡在各种俱乐部里夸夸其谈，不把妻子放在心上。

安森反反复复地听人讲起这件事，因此他也越来越恼火。他回想起以前和叔叔的感情，那是一种超越了私人关系的感情，是一种让他感到骄傲的家族团结的归属感。他不用动脑筋就找到了事情的关键所在，那就是，他的叔叔不该受到伤害。这是他第一次尝试主动干涉别人的事情，不过，就他对艾德娜性格的了解，他觉得这件事他会比一位区法官和他叔叔处理得都好。

他叔叔在温泉城。为了万无一失，安森对这桩丑事进行了跟踪调查，然后他给艾德娜打了个电话，约她第二天在广场饭店共进午餐。一定是他的语气里透出的某种东西把她吓坏了，因为她不想去，可是他坚持让她去，他一再把见面的时间向后推，直到她找不到拒绝的借口。

她如约来到广场饭店的大厅里和他见面。她是个灰色眼睛的金发美人，穿着俄国紫貂大衣，很可爱，但终究有点年老色衰。五枚大戒指的钻石和绿宝石在她那纤细的手指上闪着寒光。安森认为，这些将她那正在凋零的美丽容颜装饰得雍容华贵的皮草和钻石，是他的父亲用智慧挣来的，这些东西和他的叔叔沾不上边。

尽管艾德娜已经嗅出了他的敌意，但是她还是没有料到他会如此直言不讳。

“艾德娜，我对你的所作所为感到震惊，”他开门见山、态度强硬地说，“一开始，我简直无法相信。”

“相信什么？”她厉声质问。

“你不必在我面前装蒜，艾德娜。我想谈谈凯利·斯隆的事。就算把别的事情都抛开不讲，我也觉得你不能如此对待罗伯特叔叔——”

“你听好了，安森——”她气鼓鼓地说，不过他那不容置疑的声音盖过了她的声音：

“——和你的孩子们。你已经结婚十八年了。你也是这么大年纪的人了，应该更清楚。”

“你不能这样和我讲话！你——”

“我能，我当然能。罗伯特叔叔一直都是我最好的朋友。”他被自己的话深深地感动了。他打心眼里为叔叔感到悲哀，为他的三个孩子感到悲哀。

艾德娜站起来，尝都没尝她那杯沙果鸡尾酒。

“这真是蠢透了——”

“好吧，如果你不同意我的劝告，我就去找罗伯特叔叔，把事情和盘托出——反正他早晚都会知道的。然后，我再去找老摩西·斯隆。”

艾德娜颤颤巍巍地坐回到椅子上。

“别那么大声。”她乞求他，眼里泪水涟涟，“你不知道你的声音有多少人都能听得到。你要对我横加指责，也该找个没人的地方。”

他没有回答。

“哼，我知道，你从来都不喜欢我。”她继续说，“你正好利用这些荒唐的流言蜚语，来破坏我有生以来唯一让我感兴趣的友谊。我做了什么让你这么恨我？”

安森依然等待着。她会求他表现出骑士风度，乞求他的怜悯，最后还要求助于他那优越的教养——等这些步骤走完之后，接下来就该她坦白了，他就可以把她攥在手心里了。他就这样一言不发，无动于衷，又连续不断地使出他的撒手锏：动之以真情。等午饭时间结束的时候，他已经把她逼到失去理智的绝望之中了。两点钟的时候，她掏出一面镜子和一条手帕，擦干泪痕，在眼泪流过、微微下陷的凹痕上补了些脂粉。她同意五点钟的时候在她自己家里和他见面。

他来的时候，她浑身软塌塌地躺在一张铺有夏季用的印花棉布的榻椅上，午饭时被他招惹出来的眼泪似乎依然在她的眼睛里打转。接着，他发现凯利·斯隆脸色阴沉，焦灼地站在冷冰冰的壁炉旁。

“你想怎么样？”斯隆突然大发雷霆，“我知道你请艾德娜吃午饭了，然后还用那些卑劣的诽谤来威胁她。”

安森坐下来。

“我没有理由认为那只是诽谤。”

“我听说你准备把这件事告诉罗伯特·亨特和我父亲。”

安森点点头。

“除非你们断绝关系——否则我就这么干。”他说。

“这事他妈的跟你有什么关系，亨特？”

“别发脾气，凯瑞，”艾德娜紧张地说，“你只要告诉他这事有多么荒唐——”

“一方面，我的姓氏被人们当作笑柄到处议论，”安森打断他的话，“这都是拜你所赐，凯瑞。”

“艾德娜不是你们家的人。”

“她当然是！”他的火气直往上蹿，“哼——她的这幢房子和手指上的这些戒指都是我父亲辛苦挣来的。罗伯特叔叔娶她的时候，她连一分钱都没有。”

他们都看着戒指，仿佛它们对这件事有着至关重要的意义。艾德娜佯装要把戒指从手指上取下来。

“我觉得世界上不只有这几个戒指吧。”斯隆说。

“哦，真是荒唐，”艾德娜大声叫道，“安森，你愿意听我说句话吗？我知道这些愚蠢的谣言是怎么传出去的。是那个被我解雇的女仆，她直接去了奇里谢弗斯家——俄国人都喜欢听仆人们说东道西，然后再添油加醋地以讹传讹。”她怒气冲冲地一拳砸到桌子上，“去年冬天，我们在南方的时候，汤姆把他的豪华轿车借给他们用了整整一个月后——”

“听明白了吗？”斯隆急切地问道，“这个女仆颠倒是非，她知道我和艾德娜是朋友，就把这事告诉了奇里谢弗斯家的人了。在俄国，他们认为如果一个男人和一个女人——”

他把这个问题提高到论述高加索地区的社会关系的层面上了。

“果真如此，最好还是向罗伯特叔叔解释一下吧，”安森冷冷地说，“这样的话，等谣言传到他耳朵里的时候，他就知道并非真有其事。”

他依然采用吃午饭时对付艾德娜的办法，任由他们解释。他知道他们有私情，他也知道，他们马上就会跨过解释这道线，为自己辩解。他知道他们说不清楚，他们越是辩解就越是会把自己置于罪恶昭昭的境地，而他只管以逸待劳，不动声色就行了。到了七点钟，他们已经孤注一掷，决定把真相告诉他——由于罗伯特的忽视，艾德娜的生活很空虚，一次不经意的调情使他们擦出了激情的火花——但是和许多真实的故事一样，不幸的是他们的故事太老套了，它那虚弱无力的躯体徒劳地撞击着安森意志的盔甲。安森扬言要找斯隆的父亲，这个威胁让他们无计可施。老斯隆是阿拉巴马一个退休的棉花经纪人，是个臭名昭著的正统派基督徒，通过严格限制给儿子的生活补贴来控制他，并撂下狠话，如果他再做出出格的事情，就永远断了他的生活补贴。

他们在一家法国小餐厅吃饭，继续讨论——斯隆曾试图以武力相威胁，过了片刻，他们又恳求他给他们点时间。可是安森很冷酷，他看到艾德娜马上就要崩溃了，他们哪怕说破嘴皮子，他也一定不会给她恢复精神的机会了。

深夜两点钟，在第五十三大街上的一个小型夜总会里，艾德娜的精神突然崩溃了，她哭喊着要回家。斯隆喝了整整一个晚上的酒，烂醉如泥，他也变得脆弱起来，歪在桌子上，双手捧着脸，低声哭泣着。安森不失时机地开出条件。斯隆必须从这座城市离开半年时间，而且必须在四十八小时之内消失。等他再回来的时候，两个人不许再有私情。不过，到年底的时候，艾德娜如果愿意，可以告诉罗伯特·亨特，她想离婚，然后按正常手续办理离婚即可。

他打住话题，从他们的表情上看，他胜券在握，于是他抛出了最后一句话。

“或者，你们还有一个选择，”他一板一眼地说，“如果艾德娜想离开孩子们的话，我不会阻止你们一起私奔。”

“我想回家！”艾德娜又哭喊起来，“哦，难道这一整天你还没把我们折磨够吗？”

外面很黑，只有从第六大街上照过来的一点模模糊糊的灯光。借着这点灯光，这两个曾经的情人最后一次看了一眼对方那悲伤的脸庞，意识到他们都没有足够的青春和力量来避免这永久的分离了。斯隆突然沿着街道走了，安森拍了拍一个正在打盹的出租车司机的胳膊。

差不多四点钟了，沿着第五大街那诡异的人行道，清澈的河水悠悠地流淌着，两个妓女的影子从黑漆漆的圣托马斯教堂前面掠过。接着是安森小时候经常在那里玩耍的中央公园内荒芜的灌木丛，还有那飞驰而过的一条条街道上那些越来越多、如人名一样重要的门牌号码。这座城市是他的，他想，他的家族有五代人都生活在这里，都是这里的名门望族。没有什么变化可以撼动他们在这里的永恒地位，因为变化本身就是他和他的族人与纽约精神融为一体所依赖的必要基础。足智多谋和坚强的意志——因为在无能者那里，他的这些威胁是毫无作用的——已经将玷污他叔叔、他的家族，甚至是坐在他身边瑟瑟发抖的女人名声的尘垢洗刷干净了。

第二天早上，在皇后区大桥的一个桥柱下面的台子上发现了凯瑞·斯隆的尸体。由于夜色浓重和情绪激动，他以为自己走在黑色的水面上，不过顷刻之间，就可能没什么两样了——他真的掉进河里了——要不是他无力地在水中挣扎的时候，打算最后再想一下艾德娜，再叫一声她的名字——那就真的没什么区别了。





七


安森从来没有因为自己干预过这件事而自责过——事情弄成这样，并不是他的错。但是正义却因为非正义而受到惩罚，他发现他那最能经受住时间考验，从某种程度来说也是最珍贵的友谊结束了。他永远也不知道艾德娜是怎么歪曲事实的，但是他在叔叔家再也不受待见了。

就在圣诞节前，亨特太太在一家精挑细选的圣公会归隐天国了，安森成了什么都要管的一家之主。一个和他们一起生活了多年的未婚姑姑帮他料理家务，几个年轻一点的姑娘也由她照管，她却是力不从心，难以胜任。弟弟妹妹们都没有安森那么自立自强，他们的优缺点都比安森平庸。亨特太太的去世推迟了一个女儿进入社交界的时间，延误了另一个女儿的婚期。而且还从他们所有人的身上带走了某种深层次的东西，因为随着她的逝去，亨特家那种祥和富贵的优越生活也不存在了。

一方面，由于要交付两项遗产税而使家产大大缩水。不久，缩水后的家产还要分成六份，分别由六个孩子继承，因此，他们的财产就再也算不上是一笔可观的财富了。安森看出了一种倾向，他的几个年龄最小的妹妹，以相当敬畏的语气谈及一些二十年前并不“存在”的家族。他自己所拥有的那种优越感在她们身上并没什么体现——有时候，她们会表现出普通人的势利，这就是她们的情况。另一方面，这是他们在康涅狄格州的庄园里度过的最后一个夏天。反对住在这里的呼声太高了：“谁愿意把一年中最好的几个月时间浪费在这个死气沉沉的老镇子上？”他很不情愿地妥协了——到秋天，就卖掉这幢房子，来年夏天他们将在韦斯切斯特县租一个小一点的住所。比起父亲低调的奢华，他们的这种做法是一种倒退。对于他们的反对，他既理解又生气。他母亲活着的时候，他至少每隔一个周末都会去一次——甚至在他最快乐的几个夏天里也是如此。

然而，他自己也是这个变化的一部分，他二十几岁的时候，他那个游手好闲的阶级气数已尽，强烈的生活欲望使他从这个阶级的空架子中脱离出来。不过他没有看清这一点——他依然觉得有一种规范，一个社会标准。然而，规范根本不存在了，连纽约是否存在过真正的规范也值得怀疑。那一小撮人依然不惜代价、不顾一切地要挤进那个特殊的既定阶层中，结果只会发现把它当成一个上流社会几乎已经行不通了——或者更令人意想不到的是，他们原来避之唯恐不及的那些狂放不羁的文人却反倒居高临下地和他们坐在同一张桌子边。

二十九岁的时候，让安森忧心的主要是他那与日俱增的孤独感。现在他已经确定，他不会结婚了。他作为伴郎或迎宾员参加过无数次婚礼——他家里的一个抽屉里塞满了这次或那次婚礼上代表特定职责的领带，这些领带象征着连一年都没能维持的浪漫爱情，象征着从他的生活中完全消失的一对对夫妇。一个时代的新郎送给他的领针、金笔、袖扣等礼物曾经放在他的珠宝盒里，然后就不见了——一次次婚礼让他越来越无法想象自己会当上新郎。在给所有人的婚姻送上诚挚美好的祝愿时，他的内心却潜藏着对自己的婚姻的绝望。

快三十岁的时候，尤其是最近，他感到十分沮丧，因为婚姻损害了他的友谊。一群一群的人要么作鸟兽散，要么消失不见了，这个趋势真是让人心烦。他的那些校友——他在他们身上倾注了大部分的时间和感情——可他们偏偏最是神龙见首不见尾。大多数人都太恋家，有两个已经去世，一个定居国外，一个在好莱坞写分镜头电影剧本，安森总是他最忠实的观众。

然而，他们大多数人都住在郊区，却在市区上班，永远在郊区和市区之间来回穿梭。他们的家庭生活复杂，主要在郊区俱乐部消遣。他感触最深的就是和他们生分起来了。

这些人刚刚结婚的时候都很需要他：关于如何支配他们那点微薄的收入，他给他们提出建议；关于是不是最好把孩子生在两室一卫的房子里的问题，他为他们解除顾虑；特别是他代表的是他们融不进去的那个了不起的上流社会。可是，现在，他们的经济宽裕了，肚子里那个让人牵肠挂肚的孩子已经降生在一个令人陶醉的家庭里。见到老安森，他们依然很开心，但是他们却要刻意打扮一番，力图让他感受到他们目前过得不错，有了问题也都自己解决，他们不再需要他了。

在他三十岁生日前的几个礼拜，他发小中的最后一个单身汉也结婚了。安森一如既往地给他当伴郎，一如既往地送他银茶具，一如既往地跑到“荷马”(5)号邮轮旁和他们道别。那是五月的一个礼拜五下午，天气炎热。离开码头的时候，他意识到礼拜六就开始休息了，直到礼拜一早上他都无事可做。

“去哪儿呢？”他问自己。

当然是去耶鲁俱乐部，打桥牌，一直打到吃晚饭，然后到谁家里去喝上四五杯不掺水的鸡尾酒，晕晕乎乎地度过一个愉快的夜晚。他为今天下午的新郎官不能一同前往而遗憾——以前，像这样的夜晚，他们总能玩出很多花样：他们知道如何吸引女人，如何甩掉她们，知道哪个女孩值得他们这些聪明的享乐主义者给予多少关心。参加派对是需要把握分寸的——你带着姑娘们去到某些地方，为了取悦她们而慷慨解囊。酒嘛，你可以稍微多喝一点，但不要太多，到第二天早晨的某个时候，你站起来说你要回家了。你不要和在校的大学男生打交道，不要喝得酩酊大醉，不要承诺下一次约会，不要打架，不要多愁善感，避免轻率的行为。事情就该这么做，否则就会有失检点。

早晨，你永远不会感到非常歉疚——你也不会痛下决心。但是如果你把事情做得过了头，无法心安理得的话，那么你就什么也不要说，坐着车出去几天，直到心里的烦闷积累到无法忍受的程度，再次把你推向另一个派对上去。

耶鲁俱乐部的大厅里空无一人。酒吧里有三个小校友立刻抬起头，见怪不怪地看了他一眼。

“你好，奥斯卡，”他对酒吧侍者说，“凯希尔先生今天下午来这儿了吗？”

“凯希尔先生去纽黑文了。”

“哦……是吗？”

“去参加棒球比赛了。许多人都去了。”

安森又朝大厅里看了一眼，沉思了片刻，然后走出去，来到第五大街。透过他常参加的一个俱乐部的大窗户——这个俱乐部他几乎有五年都没有去了——一个白发苍苍、眼泪汪汪的人低头看着他。安森赶忙躲开他的目光，朝别的地方看去——那个人坐在那里，一副无助的样子，傲慢而孤独，这使他很沮丧。他停下脚步，沿老路返回，来到第四十七大街，朝迪克·沃尔顿的公寓走去。迪克和他的妻子曾经是他最熟悉的朋友——这个家是他和多丽·卡尔格谈情说爱时常去的地方。但是，迪克开始喝酒，他妻子曾经当着众人的面说过安森对他的影响很坏。这句话以非常夸张的形式传到了安森的耳朵里——当最后澄清事实的时候，他们之间微妙的亲近关系还是破裂了，再也无法恢复了。

“沃尔顿先生在家吗？”他问道。

“他们去乡下了。”

这句话出人意料地给了他重重的一击。他们去乡下了，他竟然不知道。如果是两年前，他会知道他们离开的具体日期和时间，并赶在他们离开前的最后一刻到来，喝下最后一杯酒，还计划着去乡下对他们进行首次拜访。然而现在，他们竟然连个招呼都不打说走就走了。

安森看看手表，准备和自己的家人一起过个周末，但是只有一趟慢车，要在炎炎酷暑中颠簸三个小时。明天，还有礼拜天都要在乡下度过——他可没有心情和彬彬有礼的在校大学生们蹲在走廊里一起打桥牌。吃过晚饭后，他也没心情在路边的乡村小旅馆里跳舞，这个小小的乐趣，他父亲当初的估计过于乐观了。

“哦，不，”他自言自语地说，“不。”

他是个高傲的、令人印象深刻的年轻人，现在很胖，但是除此之外，他并没有给人放浪形骸之感。他是某方面的一个栋梁之材——有时候你敢肯定他不会在社会上，有时候你又很肯定他一定会在社会上——在社会法则、教会原则方面，成为一个中流砥柱之类的人物。他在第四十七大街上的一幢公寓前的人行道上一动不动地站了几分钟，这几乎是他有生以来第一次感到无事可做。

然后他沿着第五大街开始健步如飞起来，好像他刚刚想起一个重要的约会。必要的掩饰是人类和狗共有的为数不多的几个特征之一。我觉得那天的安森就是一个教养良好的典范，一扇熟悉的后门让他感到失望后，他打算去看看尼克。尼克是个很抢手的酒吧侍者，所有的私人舞会都争着要他，现在受雇于广场酒店，在迷宫似的酒窖里为不含酒精的香槟做冷处理。

“尼克，”他说，“一切都好吧？”

“无聊死了。”尼克说。

“给我来一杯酸威士忌。”安森朝柜台里面递了个一品托的瓶子。“尼克，姑娘们都变了。我在布鲁克林有个小姑娘，上个礼拜背着我偷偷地结婚了。”

“真的吗？哈——哈——哈，”尼克礼节性地答道，“她把你甩了。”

“一点没错，”安森说，“前一天晚上我还带她出去了呢。”

“哈——哈——哈，”尼克笑道，“哈——哈——哈！”

“尼克，还记得温泉城的那场婚礼吗，我让侍者和乐师们唱《上帝拯救国王》的那次？”

“呃，那是在哪儿呢，亨特先生？”尼克一脸疑惑地努力回想，“我好像记得那是——”

“他们再次回来要钱，越要越多，我都开始糊涂了，不知道已经给了他们多少了。”安森接着说。

“我好像记得那是特伦霍姆先生的婚礼。”

“不认识他。”安森断然地说。一个陌生的名字闯入他的回忆让他不胜烦恼。尼克看出了这一点。

“不是——不是——”他承认道，“我应该记得那场婚礼的。那是你的一个朋友——布拉金斯——贝克尔——”

“比克尔·贝克尔，”安森马上说道，“婚礼结束后，他们把我装进灵车里，上面盖上鲜花，把我运走了。”

“哈——哈——哈，”尼克笑道，“哈——哈——哈。”

尼克模仿老家仆的样子不一会儿就显得挺没劲儿的，于是安森便到楼上的大厅里去了。他看向四周——看到服务台旁有一个陌生的服务员，然后他又将目光落在一个铜痰盂里摇来摇去的一朵花上，那是上午的婚礼结束后被人丢弃的。他走出酒店，又迎着哥伦布转盘广场上空血红的太阳慢腾腾地走去。突然，他转过身，原路返回到广场酒店，把自己关在一个电话亭里。

后来他说，他那天下午给我打了三个电话都没有拨通，他给每个可能在纽约的人都拨了电话——几年没见的男人和姑娘们，一个在他大学时代给艺术家当模特的人，她那褪了色的电话号码还保留在他的电话簿里——接线员告诉他，甚至连那个电话总机都不存在了。最后他将希望寄托在乡下，和语气生硬的管家和女仆们进行了简短而令人失望的谈话：某某出门了，骑马去了，游泳去了，打高尔夫去了，上个礼拜就乘船去欧洲了。敢问您是哪位呀？

独自一人熬过那个夜晚是令人难以忍受的——当你感到孤独的时候，拥有一刻闲暇的个人愿望就完全失去魅力了。那类女人总是有的，但是他认识的那些都暂时消失了，而他从没想过要雇个陌生人来共度一个纽约之夜——过去他会认为这是一种耻辱，一种不能为外人道的秘密，是出差在外的推销员在一个陌生的城市里的一种消遣。

安森付了电话费——那个姑娘想拿这笔可观的电话费和他开个玩笑，却没有成功。那天下午，他第二次离开广场酒店，不知道何去何从。在旋转门旁边，一个女人的身影，显然是怀了身孕，斜对着灯光站在人行道上——薄薄的米黄色披肩在她的肩头飘动，她不耐烦地看着旋转门的每一次转动，似乎已经等累了。第一眼看到她，他就感到一种久违的、强烈的、神经质的战栗，但是直到走近她，离她只有五英尺远的时候，他才认出是宝拉。

“嗨，安森·亨特！”

他的心狂跳不止。

“嗨，宝拉——”

“哇哦，好极了。简直难以置信，安森！”

她牵着他的双手，从她的这种毫无拘束的动作中，他明白了，他带给她的辛酸往事已经烟消云散了。但是，他的记忆还没有消失——他觉得她在他心中燃起的旧情在不知不觉间让他念念不忘，他依然能感觉到以前在面对她的快乐时，他一直持有的那种温柔情怀，那种生怕破坏了欢乐气氛的温柔情怀。

“我们来拉伊避暑。彼得来东部出差——你一定知道，我现在是彼得太太了——因此我们带着孩子们，买了一套房子。你一定得过来看看我们。”

“我可以去吗？”他直截了当地问，“什么时候方便？”

“随你。彼得来了。”旋转门转动了，从里面走出来一个三十岁的男人，他又帅又高，脸膛黝黑，胡子修剪得整整齐齐的。他那毫无挑剔的健美体形和安森日渐发福，显然将燕尾服绷得有点紧的肥硕体形形成鲜明的对比。

“你不该站着。”哈格迪对妻子说，“我们到那儿坐坐。”他指着大厅里的椅子说，但是宝拉有点犹豫不决。

“我得赶紧回家，”她说，“安森，要不你——要不你今晚过来和我们一起吃晚饭吧？我们正好刚刚安顿下来，只是如果你能忍受——”

哈格迪热情地增加了邀请的诚意。

“今晚就过来吧。”

他们的车在酒店前等着，宝拉拖着疲惫的身体坐在角落里的丝绸垫子上。

“我有太多的话想跟你说，”她说，“似乎没什么机会。”

“我洗耳恭听。”

“呃，”她朝哈格迪笑了笑，“真是说来话长。我有三个孩子——都是和我前夫生的。老大五岁，老二四岁，老三三岁。”她又笑了，“我生他们一点都没有浪费时间，是吗？”

“都是男孩吗？”

“一个男孩，两个女孩。然后——哦，发生了太多事情。一年前，我在巴黎离了婚，又和彼得结了婚。情况就是这样——另外我想说的是，我幸福极了。”

到了拉伊，他们把车开到沙滩俱乐部旁边的一座大房子前，里面立刻跑出来三个皮肤黝黑、身材瘦小的孩子，他们从英国女教师身边挣脱出来，用别人无法听懂的声音大叫着向他们跑来。宝拉心不在焉地、吃力地将他们挨个揽进怀里，他们每个人都有所顾忌地受到了母亲的爱抚，因为他们显然受到过提醒，不要撞着妈妈。即使和他们那鲜活的小脸相比，宝拉的肌肤也几乎看不出一点衰老的迹象——虽然她的身体看起来慵懒倦怠，她看起来却比七年前他在棕榈滩最后一次见到她时更年轻。

吃晚饭的时候，她显得心事重重。晚饭后，在听广播的时候，她闭着眼睛躺在沙发上，弄得安森很纳闷，怀疑自己在这个时候出现是不是一种打扰。但是九点的时候，哈格迪站起来愉快地说，他准备让他们单独待一会儿，她才开始慢慢地说起自己，说起过去。

“我的第一个孩子，”她说，“那个我们叫她‘宝贝’的孩子，我的大女儿——当我知道我怀上她的时候，我都不想活了，因为洛厄尔对我来说就像一个陌生人。感觉就像是她不可能是我自己的孩子。我给你写了一封信，又把它撕掉了。哦，你对我太糟糕，安森。”

她又恢复了往日那种抑扬顿挫的谈话方式，安森的记忆突然苏醒了。

“你是不是订过一次婚？”她问道，“和一个叫多丽还是什么名字的姑娘？”

“我从来没有订过一次婚。我努力了，但是除了你，我谁也不爱，宝拉。”

她“哦”了一声。然后，过了一会儿，她说：“这个孩子是第一个我真正想要的孩子。你知道，我现在——我终于坠入爱河了。”

他没有回答，被她言语间的背叛惊呆了。她一定知道“终于”这个词可以伤害到他，因为她接着说：

“我对你一片痴情，安森——你能让我为你做任何你喜欢的事情，但是我们不会幸福的。对你来说，我不够聪明。我和你不一样，不想把事情复杂化。”她顿了一下。“你的心永远都停不下来。”她说。

这句话仿佛使他挨了一记闷棍似的——怎么怪他都行，可唯独这个指责是他永远都不该领受的。

“要是女人们不像现在这样，我的心就会靠岸。”他说，“如果不是我对她们了解得太深，如果女人们不因为其他女人而让你扫兴，如果她们能有哪怕一丁点自尊，我的心都会安定下来。如果我能好好睡一会儿，一觉醒来，发现自己在真正属于自己的家里，那真是我梦寐以求的——哦，那是我一直为之努力的，宝拉。那也是女人们从我身上看到的东西，也是她们喜欢我的原因。只是我再也不能从头来过了。”

哈格迪在快到十一点的时候回来了；宝拉喝了一杯威士忌，站起来说她要去睡觉了。她走过去站到丈夫身边。

“你去哪儿了，最最亲爱的？”她问道。

“我和艾德·桑德拉喝了一杯。”

“我很担心，我以为你也许逃跑了。”

她把头靠在他的大衣上。

“他很贴心，是吗，安森？”她问道。

“绝对贴心。”安森笑着说。

她抬起头看着丈夫。

“哦，我准备好了。”她说。她转过身对安森说：“你想看看我们家的特技表演吗？”

“想啊。”他饶有兴趣地说。

“好，我们开始吧！”

哈格迪轻松地把她抱在怀里。

“这就是我们的家庭特技表演，”宝拉说，“他抱我上楼。他是不是很贴心？”

“是的。”安森说。

哈格迪微微低下头，将他的脸贴到宝拉的脸上。

“我爱他，”她说，“刚才我一直都在给你讲我爱他，是吧，安森？”

“是的。”他说。

“他是这个世界上最亲爱的宝贝，是吗，亲爱的？……哦，晚安。我们休息去了。他是不是很强壮？”

“是的。”安森说。

“彼得的睡衣给你准备好了，你穿上吧。做个好梦——明天早餐时再见。”

“好的。”安森说。





八


公司里的几个老员工坚持认为，安森应该到国外去避避暑。他们说，七年来他几乎没有休过假。他暮气沉沉的，需要去换换心情。安森却坚决反对。

“如果我走了，”他大声宣布，“就再也不会回来了。”

“这是什么话，老兄。三个月后，你就会一改这失魂落魄的样子，精神抖擞地回来的，而且和以前一样健朗了。”

“不。”他固执地摇摇头，“我一旦停止工作，就再也不想工作了。我一旦停止工作，就意味着我已经放弃了——意味着我彻底完了。”

“我们愿意冒这个风险。度六个月的假也行，随便你——我们不担心你会离开我们的。因为，如果不工作的话，你会感到很难过的。”

他们为他安排了行程。他们喜欢安森——每个人都喜欢安森——他身上所发生的变化让公司蒙上了世界末日来临的阴影。他那股一直把公司经营得风生水起的热情，他对同级及下属们的关切，他那至关重要的鼓舞人心的存在感——在这四个月的时间里，他由于神经高度紧张，已经将这些优良品质消磨殆尽，变成了一个悲观失望、烦躁不安的四十岁老头。他每做一笔生意都只会拖后腿，只会把事情弄僵。

“我一旦走了，就再也不回来了。”他说。

在他乘船出发的前三天，宝拉·勒让德·哈格迪死于难产。那时，我有很多时间都和他在一起，因为我们一起漂洋过海。但是在我们的交往中，他第一次对他的感受守口如瓶，我也丝毫看不出他的情绪变化。他一天到晚都想着自己已经三十岁了——每次谈话，他都会转变话题，提醒你，他已经三十岁了，然后就沉默不语了，似乎他认为这种说法会开启一连串的回忆，这本身就已经足够了。和他的合伙人一样，我对他的变化也感到非常吃惊。当“巴黎号”轮船开到介于两个世界之间的一片海域时，他终于把自己的那个世界抛到脑后了，这让我感到非常高兴。

“喝一杯怎么样？”他提议道。

我们怀着出发当天所特有的那种蔑视一切的心情走进一家酒吧，要了四杯马提尼鸡尾酒。一杯鸡尾酒下肚，他便有了变化——他突然伸出手，朝我的膝盖上拍了一下。几个月以来，我第一次看到他快活起来。

“你看见那个戴着红色宽顶无檐帽的姑娘了吗？”他问，“就是那个脸色红润，有两个警察像忠实的小狗似的赶来和她道别的那个姑娘。”

“她很漂亮。”我附和道。

“我在乘务长的办公室里查看了她的资料，我发现她是独自旅行。我一会儿要去见一下乘务员。我们晚上就和她共进晚餐。”

过了一会儿，他离开了，不到一个小时的时间，他就和她一起在甲板上来来回回地散起步来了，并用他那铿锵有力、清晰浑厚的声音同她交谈着。她那顶红色的帽子在深绿色大海的映衬下变成一个鲜艳的亮点。她时不时地猛然甩一下头，仰起脸，开心地、饶有兴趣地、满怀期待地微笑着。晚饭的时候，我们喝了香槟酒，大家都非常高兴——饭后，安森浑身使劲地冲向游泳池，这个动作非常具有感染力。有几个人看见我和他是一起的，就向我打听他的名字。我去睡觉的时候，他仍然和那个姑娘一起在酒吧里有说有笑。

旅途中，我想见他的时候总是找不到他的人影。他本想凑够四个人一起玩双打，却没找齐，因此我只能在吃饭的时候见到他。尽管有时候他会在酒吧里喝鸡尾酒，并给我讲那个戴红帽子的姑娘，讲他和她的各种奇遇，让人觉得不可思议又忍俊不禁。做这种事，他是很有一套的。我也很高兴，他终于找回了自己，或者至少找回了我所了解的、让人感觉自在的自己。我想，要是有人爱他，像碎铁屑粘在磁石上一样依恋他，帮助他理解自己，给他某些承诺的话，他是不是才会找到幸福。至于那承诺是什么，我不知道。或许，她们向他承诺，世界上总有女人，愿意拿她们最明媚、最清纯、最珍贵的年华来滋养和呵护他珍藏于心的那份优越感。

重回巴比伦(1)


一


“那么，坎贝尔先生呢？”查理问道。

“去瑞士了。坎贝尔先生得了重病，威尔斯先生。”

“听你这么说我很难过。那么，乔治·哈特呢？”查理问道。

“回美国工作去了。”

“那么，那个斯诺·博德呢？”

“他上个礼拜还在这儿呢。不过，他的朋友谢佛尔(2)先生在巴黎。”

斯诺·博德和谢佛尔是一年半以前那一长串名单上的两个熟人。查理在笔记本上潦草地写了个地址，然后把这张纸撕下来。

“你要是见到谢佛尔先生，就把这个给他，”他说，“这是我连襟的地址，我还没有找好酒店。”

巴黎的熟人这么少并没有真的让他感到失望。只是丽兹酒吧冷清得出奇，里面空空如也，这倒叫人吃惊。这里不再是一家美国风格的酒吧了——他在酒吧里表现得谦逊有礼，免得让人觉得他好像是这里的老板似的。这里已经完全法国化了。他从出租车上下来看到门童的那一刻就感觉到这里很冷清了。通常，在这个时辰，门童正忙得团团转，而不是站在服务生进出的门口同一个打杂工聊个没完。

穿过走廊的时候，他只听见从往昔乱哄哄的女洗漱间里传出一个女人倦怠的声音。走进酒吧，他像往常一样目不斜视地从二十英尺的绿毯上走过；然后将一只脚稳稳地踏在吧台边的溅溢轨道上，转动目光，打量整个酒吧。里面只有一个人，正坐在角落里看报纸，那人抬起头，与他的目光不期而遇。查理要见酒吧领班保尔，这个人在股票牛市涨到顶峰时开着自己定制的汽车来上班——不过，他行事低调，把车停在最近的角落里。但是，保尔今天回他的乡村别墅了，于是艾利克斯过来招呼他。

“不，不喝了，”查理说，“这些日子我喝得少了。”

艾利克斯很为他高兴。“几年前，你喝得太多了。”

“我坚持得很好，”查理很有把握地对他说，“到目前为止，我已经坚持一年半都不止了。”

“你觉得美国的形势怎么样？”

“我有几个月没回美国了。我在布拉格有生意，我在那里代理了几家公司。那里的人不了解我的情况。”

艾利克斯笑了。

“记得乔治·哈特在这里举行单身宴会的那个晚上吗？”查理问，“另外，克劳德·费森登现在怎么样？”

艾利克斯压低嗓门，神秘兮兮地说：“他在巴黎，不过他不会再来这儿了。保尔不让他来了。一年多来，他以记账的方式在酒吧喝酒，吃午饭，还常常吃晚饭，总共花掉了三万多法郎。最后保尔通知他务必把账结清时，他却开了一张空头支票。”

艾利克斯悲哀地摇摇头。

“我真是不明白，原来那么精干的一个人，如今却臃肿不堪——”他用双手比画了一个大苹果的形状。

查理看到酒吧里来了一群娘娘腔的男妓，坐在了角落里。

“什么都影响不了他们，”他想，“股票涨涨跌跌，人们或闲或忙，但是他们永远都是这副模样。”这个地方让他感到压抑。他要了副骰子，拿酒当赌注，和艾利克斯一起摇起骰子来。

“要在这里待多久，威尔斯先生？”

“我来看女儿，要待四五天时间。”

“哟——呵，你有女儿？”

外面静静地下着雨，各种招牌的灯箱在烟雨迷蒙中闪烁着火一样的红光、煤气火焰一样的蓝光和鬼火似的绿光。傍晚时分，街上车水马龙；酒吧里灯光闪烁。在卡普新大街的拐角处，他叫了一辆出租车。协和广场在粉红色的庄严中一掠而过；接着他们不可避免地穿过塞纳河，查理蓦然觉得左岸分明是一派异地风光。

查理吩咐出租车开到歌剧院大道上，这并不是他回去的路，他只是想趁着暮色从正面见识一下歌剧院的雄伟壮观。出租车的喇叭循环播放着《更为缓慢些》(3)的几个前奏曲，查理仿佛觉得这是第二帝国的号角。他们来到布伦塔诺书店前面的铁栅栏附近。在杜瓦尔饭店那修剪整齐、具有中产阶级格调的小树篱后面，人们已经在吃晚饭了。他从来没有在巴黎一家真正的廉价饭馆吃过饭。五道菜的晚饭，四法郎五十生丁，相当于十八美分，还含酒水。出于某种奇怪的原因，他倒宁愿过去在这样的饭馆里进餐。

他们沿着左岸行驶，他突然感受到了这里的冷漠排外，他想：“是我自己在这座城市里胡作非为，我以前没有意识到这一点。但是时光不等人，日子照样一天天流逝，两年时间转瞬即逝，一切都无可挽回，我也回不到从前了。”

他三十五岁，相貌堂堂，眉宇间一道深深的皱纹表明他虽然有着爱尔兰人的丰富表情，却头脑清醒。当他按响帕拉丁路上连襟家的门铃时，他的眉头聚成了一座山峰，同时他觉得肚子一阵痉挛。女佣为他打开门，一个九岁的漂亮小姑娘突然从她身后跑出来，大声叫着“爹地”，飞奔过来，像条鱼似的钻进他的怀里。她捏着他的一只耳朵，将他的头往旁边一扭，让自己的小脸蛋贴到他的面颊上。

“我的小话匣子。”他说。

“哦，爹地，爹地，爹地，爹地，爸爸，爸爸，爸爸！”

她拉着他走进客厅，一家人——一个男孩、一个和他女儿同龄的小姑娘、他的小姨子及其丈夫都在里面等着。他小心翼翼地向玛丽恩问好，既不显得虚情假意的热情，又不表露出厌恶之情。然而，她的反应不冷不热，比他直截了当得多，尽管她将注意力放到他女儿的身上，想以此将她对他一成不变的怀疑尽可能地掩饰起来。两个男人友好而真诚地握了握手，然后林肯·彼得斯将双手在查理的肩膀上按了一会儿。

房间里洋溢着温暖而舒适的美国式氛围。三个孩子亲密无间，到处走动，在连通其他房间的黄色门框间穿梭玩耍。炉火在噼里啪啦地燃烧，厨房里传出法国式的声响，这一切都诉说着六点钟的欢乐气氛。但是，查理依然很紧张，心里七上八下，只能从女儿那里得到些信心，她时不时地跑到他的身边，抱着他为她买的布娃娃。

“真的好极了，”他大声回答林肯的问话，“那里的生意大部分都不景气，不过我们的生意做得比以往任何时候都好。简直好极了。下个月我打算让我妹妹过去帮我照料家务。去年我的收入比以前我风光的时候还要多。你知道，捷克人——”

他做这番吹嘘是出于一个明确的目的；但是吹了一会儿，他从林肯的眼神里看出了一点不满，就换了个话题：

“你的两个孩子很好，家教好，有礼貌。”

“我们觉得霍诺丽雅也是个很棒的小姑娘。”

玛丽恩·彼得斯从厨房里回来了，她个子高挑，眼神忧郁，以前也是个清纯漂亮的美国姑娘。不过，查理从来都不觉得，当人们说起她过去有多漂亮的时候，他总是感到很吃惊。他们两个从一开始就是天生的冤家。

“呃，你觉得霍诺丽雅怎么样？”她问道。

“好极了，我很吃惊，她在十个月的时间里长高了这么多。孩子们看起来都很健康。”

“我们一年都没有看过医生了。回到巴黎感觉怎么样？”

“周围几乎看不到一个美国人，好像很奇怪。”

“我可是很高兴，”玛丽恩言辞激烈地说，“现在，你走进商店，至少不会让人觉得你是个百万富翁了。我们和其他人一样备受煎熬，但是总体上我们还是挺快乐的。”

“不过，那种日子如果能够维持的话，还是挺不错的，”查理说，“我们有点宫廷皇族的感觉，想不到会有没落的时候，我们有点像是生活在奇妙的世界里。今天下午在酒吧，”他意识到自己说错话了，结巴了一下，“——那里我一个人也不认识。”

她死死地盯着他。“我想你酒吧去得够多了吧。”

“我只待了一会儿。我每天下午喝一杯酒，不多喝。”

“晚饭前不喝一杯鸡尾酒吗？”林肯问道。

“每天下午我只喝一杯酒，今天已经喝过了。”

“希望你能够坚持。”玛丽恩说。

她的厌恶之情溢于言表，说话的腔调冷冰冰的，而查理只是赔着笑脸；他有更大的计划。她咄咄逼人的态度恰恰有利于他，他很清楚，他需要耐心等待。他想让他们先提出那个敏感的话题，他们知道他来巴黎的目的。

吃晚饭的时候，他看着霍诺丽雅，说不清她像他多一点还是像她母亲多一点。他们俩的性格都会给自身招致灾难，如果他们两个都没有把自己的性格遗传给她的话，该有多么幸运。他顿时生出一股强烈的保护欲望，他觉得他知道该为她做些什么。他相信人的天性，他想回到小时候，重新拥有，永远珍惜和保护那种天性。可惜为时已晚了。

晚饭后，他早早地离开了，但是他没有回酒店。他急于用比以前更加清醒、更加审慎的眼光来看看夜晚的巴黎。他买了一张杂剧院的加座票，从头到尾观看了约瑟芬·贝克(4)用她那巧克力色的身体表演的阿拉贝斯克芭蕾舞。

一个小时后，他离开杂剧院，朝蒙马特高地(5)走去。他沿着皮加勒路来到布兰奇广场。雨已经停了。卡巴莱歌舞厅门前，几个人穿着晚礼服从出租车上走下来，妓女们或独自一人或两两结伴地在那里徘徊，还有很多黑人。他经过一家灯火通明的店面，里面放着音乐，他带着一种久违的亲切感驻足倾听；那是布里克托普舞厅，他曾经在那里虚掷了大把的青春和金钱；他又经过几家店面，看到一个以前光顾过的娱乐场，不假思索地伸头去看。里面的乐队像看到救星一样立刻奏起音乐，一对职业舞者赶忙跳起来，一个领班一边朝他奔过来，一边大声喊：“人们马上就来了，先生！”他赶忙退了出去。

“进这种地方，除非你又喝醉了。”他想。

泽利咖啡馆已经打烊，周围那些寒碜、丧气的廉价旅店已经在黑暗中沉沉睡去；布兰奇路上灯光明亮，一群当地的法国人还在那里聊天。“诗人之家”咖啡馆已经销声匿迹，而“天堂咖啡屋”和“地狱咖啡屋”仍然张着两个大嘴巴——在他的眼皮底下将一辆公交车上寥寥无几的乘客吞了进去——一个德国人，一个日本人，一对惶恐地看了他一眼的美国夫妇。

蒙马特高地的能耐和智慧仅此而已，所有引人犯罪、使人萎靡的欢乐场都稚气十足，完全不成气候。他蓦然懂得了“挥霍”这个词的含义了——就是变得无影无踪，变得一无所有。在夜里微不足道的几个时辰里，人们从一个地方到另一个地方的每一次移动都是一次巨大的飞跃，也使他们为越来越悠游自在、纸醉金迷的生活付出越来越高昂的代价。

他记得当时只让乐队演奏一支曲子，就付给他们上千法郎的钞票；让门童为他叫辆出租车，就扔给他上百法郎的钞票。

然而，他的这些慷慨之举并不是没给他带来任何回报。

甚至是那些最疯狂地挥霍一空的钱财也都是对命运的一种祭奠，命运让他将最值得铭记的东西抛诸脑后，这就是他得到的回报，尽管这些事情让现在的他耿耿于怀——他被剥夺了孩子的抚养权，他的妻子从他身边逃离，被埋在佛蒙特州的坟墓里。

在一家灯光炫目的小酒馆里，一个女人向他搭讪。他为她买了咖啡和几个鸡蛋，避开她那直勾勾的暧昧目光，给了她一张二十法郎的钞票，乘出租车回到了下榻的酒店。





二


他在宜人的秋日中醒来——这天气很适合踢球。昨日的沮丧烟消云散，看到路上的行人他都会心生欢喜。中午，他和霍诺丽雅面对面坐在瓦泰尔大酒店里，这是唯一一家不会勾起他回忆的饭店，不会让他回忆起香槟晚宴和下午两点钟开始一直到天色朦胧的黄昏才结束的漫长的午餐会。

“嗨，来点蔬菜怎么样？你是不是应该吃点蔬菜？”

“嗯，好的。”

“有菠菜、花椰菜、胡萝卜和扁豆。”

“我喜欢吃花椰菜。”

“要不要点两种蔬菜？”

“我午饭通常只吃一种蔬菜。”

侍者假装非常喜欢孩子。“这个小姑娘好可爱啊！她的法语和法国人说得一模一样。”

“要点心吗？我们吃一会儿再点，行吗？”

侍者走了，霍诺丽雅满怀期待地看着父亲。

“我们接下来做什么？”

“我们先去圣诺雷路上的玩具店，你喜欢什么就买什么。然后我们去帝国剧院看把戏。”

她犹豫了一会儿。“我喜欢看把戏，不想买玩具。”

“为什么不想买玩具？”

“呃，你已经给我买了这个布娃娃了。”她把布娃娃带来了，“我有许多玩具了。我们现在不是有钱人了，是吗？”

“我们从来都不是有钱人。但是今天，你想要什么就可以买什么。”

“好吧。”她乖巧地说。

当初她有母亲疼，有法国保姆爱的时候，他对她很严厉。现在，他尽可能让自己多些宽容，他必须承担起父亲和母亲的双重职责，必须尽可能地多和女儿沟通。

“我想认识你，”他一本正经地说，“我先做个自我介绍吧。我叫查尔斯(6)·J.威尔斯，来自布拉格。”

“哦，爹地！”她咯咯地笑起来。

“请告诉我你是谁，好吗？”他坚持说。她马上接受了自己的角色：“霍诺丽雅·威尔斯，来自巴黎的帕拉丁路。”

“已婚还是单身？”

“不，没有结婚，单身。”

他指了指布娃娃。“可是，我看到你有孩子了，夫人。”

她不愿意说这个布娃娃不是她的孩子，因此她把它抱到怀里，飞快地开动脑筋：“是的，我结过婚，但是我现在是单身，我丈夫死了。”

他赶紧接上话题：“这孩子叫什么名字？”

“西蒙娜，这是我最要好的同学的名字。”

“你学习那么好，我很高兴。”

“这次月考我是第三名，”她得意地说，“艾尔西”——她的表妹——“大概才考了第十八名，理查德差不多垫底了。”

“你喜欢理查德和艾尔西，是吗？”

“哦，是的。我非常喜欢理查德。艾尔西嘛，还算喜欢吧。”

他谨慎地却又装出无所谓的样子问：“玛丽恩姨妈和林肯姨父——你更喜欢谁？”

“呃，我想我更喜欢林肯姨父。”

他越来越对她刮目相看了。他们进来的时候，身后传来“……好可爱啊”的赞叹。而现在，邻桌的人都悄无声息听她讲话，还目不转睛地向她行注目礼，仿佛她是一朵没有感知能力的花似的。

“为什么我和你不住在一起呢？”她突然问，“是因为妈妈去世了吗？”

“你必须留在这里多学点法语。爸爸很难把你照顾得这么好。”

“实际上，我不需要这么多照顾。我自己什么都会干。”

走出饭店，一对男女向他打招呼，他很意外。

“嗨，老威尔斯！”

“嗨，洛琳……邓克(7)。”

昔日的幽灵突然出现：邓肯·谢佛尔(8)，他的大学同学；洛琳·夸勒斯，三十岁，面容苍白的金发美女。三年前他一掷千金的时候，曾经帮助过许多人——其中包括他们俩——虚掷年华，度月如日。

“我丈夫今年不能来，”她回答他的问话，“我们穷得要命。他每个月只给我两百块钱，说靠这点钱反正饿不死……这是你女儿？”

“再进去坐会儿，怎么样？”邓肯问。

“不行。”他很高兴找到了一个借口。他感到洛琳看他的眼神一如既往地充满热情，又带着挑逗，但是他自己的节奏现在已经改变了。

“哦，那一起吃晚饭，怎么样？”她问。

“我没空。把你们的地址给我，我给你们打电话。”

“查理，我相信你没喝醉，”她做出了判断，“说实在的，我觉得他很清醒，邓克。拧他一下，看看他是不是没喝醉。”

查理的头朝霍诺丽雅努了努，他们两人都笑起来。

“你住在什么地方？”邓肯怀疑地问。

他犹豫了一下，不想说出酒店的名字。

“我还没有安顿好。你还是等我的电话吧。我们要去帝国剧院看把戏了。”

“太好了！我也正想去呢，”洛琳说，“我想看小丑、特技和杂耍什么的。邓克，我们正打算去呢，对吗？”

“我们得先去办点事，”查理说，“也许我们会在剧院碰见你们。”

“好吧，你这个势利小人……再见，漂亮的小姑娘。”

“再见。”

霍诺丽雅彬彬有礼地行了个屈膝礼。

无论如何，这次偶遇令人不快。他们喜欢他是因为他对他们有利用价值，因为他为人实在；他们想和他见面，是因为他现在比他们强大，他们想从他身上榨取营养。

到了帝国剧院，霍诺丽雅骄傲地拒绝坐在父亲叠起来的外套上。她已然是一个拥有自己处事方式的独立个体，查理越来越一门心思地希望，在她完全长大成人之前给她施加一点小小的影响，让她带点自己的影子。但是，在如此短暂的时间里，想了解她是不可能的。

节目中场休息的时候，他们在大厅里碰见了洛琳和邓肯，那里有乐队在演奏。

“喝一杯去？”

“好吧，不过不去酒吧。我们定个桌位。”

“完美的父亲。”

查理一边心不在焉地听洛琳讲话，一边注意到霍诺丽雅的目光离开了桌子，他如饥似渴地追随着女儿的目光，在屋子里到处乱看，他很想知道她在看什么。他的目光不小心与女儿的目光遇到了一起，她笑起来。

“我想喝那种柠檬汽水。”她说。

她说什么？他希望她说什么？后来乘出租车回家的时候，他把她揽入怀中，让她的头靠在他的胸前。

“宝贝，你想过妈妈吗？”

“想过，有时候会想妈妈。”她迷迷糊糊地回答。

“希望你不要忘记她。你有她的照片吗？”

“有，我想我有。至少，玛丽恩姨妈有。你为什么不希望我忘记妈妈？”

“因为她非常爱你。”

“我也爱她。”

他们沉默了一会儿。

“爹地，我想来和你一起住。”她突然说道。

他的心跳了一下，这本来就是他的愿望啊。

“难道你过得不开心吗？”

“我很开心呀，可是我比任何人都爱你。尽管妈咪去世了，可是你也比任何人都爱我，是吗？”

“那是当然。不过，宝贝，你不会永远都最爱我。你会长大，会遇到一个和你年龄相当的人嫁给他，然后你就会忘记你还有个爹地了。”

“嗯，这倒是真的。”她静静地表示赞同。

他没有进屋，他九点钟还要再来，为了到时候不得不说的那件事，他想让自己精神焕发。

“等你安全进去后，就到那扇窗户边让我看一下。”

“好的。再见，爸爸，爸爸，爸爸，爸爸。”

他在黑漆漆的路上等着，直到她小脸红扑扑地、兴冲冲地出现在楼上的窗户边，亲亲自己的手指，将这个吻送给外面黑夜中的爸爸。





三


他们在等他开口。玛丽恩坐在咖啡器具后面，穿着庄重的黑色晚礼服，隐隐透露出她对死去的姐姐的悼念。林肯来来回回地踱着步子，由于刚才一直在讲话，现在依然很兴奋。他们和他一样急不可待地想切入主题。他几乎是开门见山，直奔主题。

“我想，你们知道我想拜见你们的初衷——我来巴黎的真正原因。”

玛丽恩摆弄着项链上的黑色星星，皱着眉。

“我非常渴望有个家，”他接着说，“而且我非常渴望霍诺丽雅在这个家里。我非常感谢你们因为霍诺丽雅母亲的缘故而收养了她，可是现在情况已经改变了——”他犹豫了一下，然后以更加具有说服力的口吻继续说，“我的情况发生了根本性的变化，我想请你们重新考虑一下这件事。对我来说，否认三年前的荒唐行为是不明智的——”

玛丽恩抬起头，冷冰冰地看着他。

“不过，一切都过去了。正如我告诉过你们的那样，一年多来，我每天最多只喝一杯酒。我故意喝一杯酒，是不想让喝酒的念头在脑海里过于膨胀。你们能理解这种感受吗？”

“无法理解。”玛丽恩显得话不投机半句多。

“那是我自己强加给自己的一种痛苦，它能让我一直都保持清醒。”

“我听懂了，”林肯说，“你是想提醒自己不要再沉迷于酒中了。”

“差不多是这个意思。有时候我忘记了，就没喝。但是，我尽量喝一杯。无论如何，我现在这种情况已经付不起喝酒的代价了。我所代理的公司对我的表现都非常满意，我还打算把我妹妹从伯灵顿带过去帮我管理家务，我也非常想把霍诺丽雅带回家。你们知道，即使在我和她母亲相处不来的时候，我们也从来没有因为任何事情而影响到霍诺丽雅。我知道她喜欢我，我也知道我有能力照顾她，而且——好吧，该说的话我都说了。你们觉得怎么样？”

他知道他现在不得不接受他们对他的各种数落，而且会持续一两个小时，这种局面很难堪。但是，如果他能控制住自己内心势必会产生的抵触情绪，而表现出一个浪子回头后的悔过态度，那么他最终有可能会达成心愿。

不能发脾气，他告诫自己。你要的不是别人的公正评价，你要的是霍诺丽雅。

林肯先开口了：“上个月接到你的信后，我们就已经在商量这件事了。我们很高兴让霍诺丽雅待在这里。她是个非常可爱的孩子，我们也很愿意帮助她，不过，问题当然不在这里——”

玛丽恩突然打断他的话。“你的清醒状态能保持多久？”她问道。

“永远，我希望。”

“谁会相信你能做到？”

“你知道我丢掉生意来到这里，整天无所事事，才开始喝醉的。那时候海伦和我游手好闲，和——”

“请不要拉海伦当垫背，我不能容忍你把她说成那样。”

他绷着脸看着她，他一直都没有弄明白，她们姐妹俩这辈子的感情到底有多深。

“我喝酒的历史大约只有一年半时间——从我们来这里直到我——身体垮掉。”

“一年半时间已经够长了。”

“够长了。”他附和道。

“我这么做完全是为了海伦，”她说，“我拼命想，她希望我怎么做。坦率地说，自从那天夜里发生了那件可怕的事，对我而言，你实际上已经不存在了。我是情不由己，她是我姐姐啊！”

“是的。”

“她临终时将霍诺丽雅托付给我。如果你那时不在疗养院，事情兴许还有转机。”

他没有作声。

“我一辈子都忘不了，那个早晨，海伦来敲我的门，她浑身湿透、瑟瑟发抖，她说你把她锁在了门外。”

查理的双手紧紧抓住椅子的扶手。这种情形比他想象的还要难以承受；他想一股脑地将想说的话释放出来，他想好好解释。但是最后他只说出半句话：“我把她锁在外面的那天晚上——”她就把他的话打断了，“再重温一次那样的情景，我可无法承受。”

林肯沉默了一会儿，说：“我们不说这个了。你想让玛丽恩放弃监护权，把霍诺丽雅交给你。我觉得关键在于她对你是否有信心。”

“我不怪玛丽恩，”查理一板一眼地说，“但是我想她完全可以信任我。直到三年前，我都有良好的记录。当然，在人性允许的范围内，我也可能随时犯错。然而如果我们再等下去的话，我就会错过霍诺丽雅的童年，失去拥有一个家的机会了。”他摇摇头，“我就会彻底失去她，难道你们不明白吗？”

“是的，我明白。”林肯说。

“这一切你以前怎么没想过？”玛丽恩问道。

“我觉得我想过的，常常想到过，只是我和海伦的关系很糟糕。我同意将监护权交给你的时候，我正直挺挺地躺在疗养院里，我的股票也被股市套牢。当时我也知道我行为不检点，那时我想，只要海伦能够安心，我什么都愿意。但是，现在情况不同了。现在我的工作、生活以及身体状况一切都正常，我谨言慎行得要命——”

“请不要在我面前下咒语。”玛丽恩说。

他吃惊地看着她。她每说一句话，厌恶之情就明显增加一层。她已经将她人生中的恐惧筑成一堵墙，再将这堵墙横亘在他和她之间。她发这通没来由的脾气可能是因为几个小时前她和厨娘发生了一点争执造成的。让霍诺丽雅生活在这样一个仇恨他的环境里，查理越来越担心了。这种仇恨情绪迟早会流露出来，一句话，一个摇头的动作，怀疑的情绪都会不可逆转地植入霍诺丽雅的心灵里。但是他尽量控制自己的表情，将怒气深埋在心底，不让人看出自己实际上已经怒火中烧。他已经走赢一步棋了，林肯已经意识到玛丽恩的话很荒唐，轻轻地问她什么时候开始认为“要命”这个词是咒语了。

“另外，”查理说，“现在我有能力给她提供优越的生活条件了，我打算带一个法国女家庭教师去布拉格。我已经租了一套新公寓——”

他不说了，他意识到自己差一点就要酿成大错。不能指望他们心平气和地接受他再次比他们自己的收入多一倍的事实。

“我想你能给她提供更奢侈的生活，我们可不能，”玛丽恩说，“你一掷千金的时候，我们却在为十元钱该怎么花而精打细算……我想你又开始过上这种日子了。”

“哦，不，”他说，“我已经学乖了。我辛苦工作了十年，你知道——直到我像很多人一样在股票市场上撞了大运，简直幸运极了。那时觉得似乎没有任何必要再干活了，所以才放弃了所有工作。那种情况不会再发生了。”

大家沉默良久，所有人都感到精神紧张，一年来查理第一次真正想喝一杯。现在他能断定林肯·彼得斯希望他得到自己的孩子。

玛丽恩突然颤抖起来；部分原因是，她看到查理现在已经站稳脚跟，她自己的母性已经认可他的愿望是出于父亲的自然天性；但是，她对他的偏见由来已久——这种偏见的形成是基于她对姐姐的幸福生活怀着有悖常理的怀疑态度，而那个可怕的夜晚给她造成的打击使这种偏见转化为她对他的仇恨。这一切又恰恰发生在她身体羸弱、精神沮丧、时运不济的时刻，更使她确信世界上有恶行和恶棍的存在。

“我那样想也是情不由己！”她突然大叫起来，“我不知道你该对海伦的死负多大责任，这件事情你得扪心自问。”

一阵痛苦的电流袭击了他的全身；有那么一会儿，他几乎就要一跃而起，一个即将脱口而出的声音被他堵在嗓子眼，让它无声地在那里挣扎徘徊。他努力克制自己，让自己镇静下来，让自己坚持一会儿，再坚持一会儿。

“别激动，”林肯尴尬地说，“我从来都不认为那是你的责任。”

“海伦死于心脏病。”查理黯然地说。

“是的，心脏病。”玛丽恩似乎话中有话。

然后，她怒气渐消，平静下来，这才看清楚他。她发现，在一定程度上，他已经控制了局面。她看看丈夫，没有得到他的支持，她突然甘拜下风，态度转变之快，仿佛让人觉得这根本就是小事一桩。

“你想怎么样就怎么样吧！”她从椅子上跳下来，大叫着说，“她是你的孩子，我并不想妨碍你。我想，如果她是我的孩子，我也宁愿看着她——”她努力克制自己，“你们俩决定吧，我受不了了。我不舒服，睡觉去了。”

她匆匆地离开了房间。过了一会儿，林肯说：

“这一天对她来说很难熬。你知道女人一旦形成一种观点——”他几乎是歉疚地说，“是多么不容易改变。”

“当然。”

“会没事的。我想她现在已经看到你——有能力养好这个孩子了，所以，我们不能总是阻碍你和霍诺丽雅。”

“谢谢你，林肯。”

“我还是去看看她怎么样了。”

“我要告辞了。”

走到街上的时候，他还在颤抖，不过沿着波拿巴路步行到塞纳河畔后他终于平静下来。穿过塞纳河，在河畔的灯光下，他显得精神抖擞，欣喜若狂，像换了个人似的。但是回到客房里，他却难以入眠。海伦的身影萦绕在他的脑海。他曾经那么爱海伦，后来他们开始不知不觉地伤害彼此的感情，直到把他们之间的爱撕成碎片。那个让玛丽恩念念不忘的二月的可怕夜晚，他们吵了好几个小时。在佛罗里达饭店他们又吵了一架，之后他试图带她回家，然后她和坐在一张桌子边的小韦伯接了吻；再然后，她就疯疯癫癫地说了那些伤人的话。他独自一人回到家，怒气冲冲地锁上了门。他怎么知道她会在一个小时后独自一个人回来？他怎么会知道会有一场暴风雪？他又怎么会知道，她穿着拖鞋在暴风雪中徘徊，由于脑子太乱，竟然不知道叫辆出租车？结果是，她奇迹般地从肺炎中躲过了一劫，随后又经历了各种恐惧，他们“和好”了。可谁承想那竟然成了那场结局的开端。玛丽恩目睹了这一切，又想象出她姐姐蒙受虐待的各种情景，想当然地认为那只不过是那许多场景中的一幕而已，便对他永远记恨在心了。

重温昔日情景，海伦和他亲近多了。黎明在他半梦半醒中悄然而至，他发现自己在柔和的微光中和海伦谈心。她说他对霍诺丽雅的态度是完全正确的，她希望霍诺丽雅和他一起生活。她说她很高兴看到他现在状态不错，而且做得越来越好。她还说了很多话——非常亲密的话——然而她穿着白色的裙子坐在秋千上，秋千越荡越快，她越飞越远，最后她说了什么，他都听不清了。

他一觉醒来，觉得很开心。世界又向他敞开了大门。他为霍诺丽雅和他自己绘制了蓝图，制订了长远规划，憧憬着美好的未来。但是，他突然伤心起来，想起了他和海伦制订过的所有计划，可她并没有把死亡计划在内，她不想死啊。现在，当务之急是——干好工作，好好爱女儿。但也不能溺爱，因为他知道如果一个父亲对女儿或一个母亲对儿子爱得过多，将会给他们带来伤害；将来孩子会到外面的世界寻找婚姻伴侣，也会付出同样盲目的柔情，甚至他们这样根本就找不到婚姻伴侣，这岂不是和爱以及生活背道而驰了么。

又是明朗清爽的一天。他打电话到林肯工作的银行，问他能否在离开巴黎去布拉格的时候将霍诺丽雅带走。林肯同意了，他说没有理由再拖延下去了。只有一件事——监护权的问题。玛丽恩想再保留一年监护权。她对整件事很不放心，她觉得如果这件事再由她掌控一年时间，将会有利于事情的进展。查理同意了。只要自己的孩子能够围绕在身边，能够看得见、摸得着就行了。

接下来该找女家庭教师了。查理坐在一家光线昏暗的中介机构里，和一个脾气暴躁的贝亚内斯人以及一个彪悍的布里多尼农妇谈了话，这两个人都让他无法忍受。明天他还要再见几个人。

他和林肯·彼得斯在格里芬饭店吃了午饭，努力克制着自己的兴奋之情。

“什么都比不上自己的女儿吧，”林肯说，“但是你也得体谅玛丽恩是怎样的心情。”

“她忘了我是多么拼命地在那里工作了七年，”查理说，“她只记住了那一个夜晚。”

“还有一个原因。”林肯迟疑了一下说，“你和海伦满欧洲吃喝玩乐、挥金如土的时候，我们却过着平平淡淡的日子。我没有沾到繁荣时期的一点光，因为我没有足够的闯劲儿，除了买了点保险，别的我什么都没有做过。我想，玛丽恩的内心有点不平衡——因为你后来什么都不干，反而越来越有钱。”

“我的钱来得快去得也快。”查理说。

“没错，你在打杂工、萨克斯手和餐厅领班身上浪费了不少钱——还好，那种奢侈的派对现在已经没有了。我只是想让你明白玛丽恩对你那些荒唐行为的感受。今晚六点钟左右，趁玛丽恩还不是太累，你如果能到我家的话，我们就可以当面具体谈谈。”

回到酒店，查理看见一封信，是从丽兹酒吧转寄过来的，他为了找一个人，曾经在那里留了个地址。

亲爱的查理：

几天前我们看到你的时候，你是那么奇怪，不知道是不是我做了什么冒犯你的事情。果真如此，那我也是无意为之。事实上，一年来，我非常想念你，我一直在想，如果我重新来到这里，就有可能见到你。在那个疯狂的春天，我们的确玩得很开心。比如那天晚上，我们俩一起偷了卖肉的三轮车。还有那个时候，我们想去拜访总统，你戴着一顶破礼帽，拄着一根金属手杖。近来，大家似乎都那么老气横秋，可是我一点都不觉得老。看在过去的情分上，我们今天能不能找个时间见个面？现在，我还宿醉未醒，不过今天下午会清醒的。五点左右，在那个把血汗钱都得花光的丽兹酒吧见吧。

永远忠诚的

洛琳

他的第一感觉是恐惧，他这个大男人的确偷过一辆三轮车，并蹬着它带着洛琳转遍了以凯旋门为中心的星形广场，从午夜一直闹到黎明。回首往事，犹如梦魇。将海伦锁在门外，与他人生当中做过的其他事情都格格不入，倒是与偷三轮车之类的荒唐行径挺相配的——这样的事情，他干得还真不少。要经过多少个礼拜、多少个月的堕落才会变成完全没有责任感的浪荡公子？

他竭力回想洛琳当年的模样——很迷人；尽管海伦对此事不置一词，但是她很不高兴。昨天在饭店里，洛琳看上去俗不可耐，邋里邋遢，精神萎靡。他一点都不想见她，他很庆幸艾利克斯没有把他住的酒店地址泄露给她。而他一想到霍诺丽雅，一想到和她一起度过的礼拜天，一想到一早醒来就能向她问早安，一想到每到夜晚她就会睡到他家的床上，听到她在黑夜里的呼吸，他就感到一种安慰。

五点钟，他乘着出租车，去给彼得斯家的每个人买礼物——一个可爱的布娃娃，一个罗马士兵礼盒，给玛丽恩的鲜花，给林肯的亚麻围巾。

走进林肯家的公寓时，他看到玛丽恩已经接受了这件必然之事。现在她向他问好，仿佛他是这个家庭中的一个顽固分子，而不是一个不怀好意的外人了。霍诺丽雅已经知道她要走了；查理高兴地看到她机灵地掩饰着压抑不住的开心。她坐在他的膝头时，才悄悄地表达了她的兴奋心情，在和其他孩子一起跑开之前，她悄悄地问道：“什么时候？”

他和玛丽恩在房间里单独待了几分钟，凭着一阵冲动，他大胆说道：

“家人之间的争吵是很痛苦的事情，分不出个青红皂白。不像是疼痛，也不像伤疤，倒更像是皮开肉绽，而且永远无法愈合，因为没有缝合的工具。希望我们俩能够冰释前嫌。”

“有些事情不是说忘就能忘的，”她答道，“这是信任的问题。”他没有应声，而她也没打算听他说什么，随即她问道：“你打算什么时候带她走？”

“女家庭教师一找到，我就带她走，希望是后天。”

“这不行。我得帮她好好准备准备。礼拜六之前都不行。”

他做出了让步。林肯回到房间里，给他倒了杯酒。

“我每天都只喝一杯威士忌。”他说。

这里很温暖，这里是一个家，家人们一起坐在火炉旁。孩子们觉得很安全，像过节似的；母亲和父亲都不苟言笑，小心谨慎。为了孩子们，他们还有事要做，这些事情比招待他、陪他说话更重要。毕竟让孩子喝下一汤匙药水比处理玛丽恩和他自己之间的紧张关系更重要。他们不是无趣的人，只是被生活和环境紧紧地束缚住了手脚。他想他是否能够为林肯做点什么，帮他摆脱银行里那一成不变的差事。

门铃响起来，声音刺耳，响个不停。能干的女佣穿过客厅，顺着走廊向门口走去。门在又一阵铃声大作中打开了。说话的声音紧接着传了进来。客厅里的三个人都抬起头，想看看来人是谁。林肯往旁边挪了挪，将走廊尽收眼底，玛丽恩索性站了起来。接着，女佣回到走廊里，说话声紧随其后，邓肯·谢佛尔和洛琳·夸勒斯出现在灯光下。

他们欢天喜地，他们嘻嘻哈哈，他们放声大笑。一时之间，查理惊呆了，他不知道他们是怎样把彼得斯家的地址刺探出来的。

“啊——哈——哈！”邓肯笑逐颜开地朝查理摇着一根手指。“啊——哈——哈！”

他们俩又爆发出一阵瀑布轰鸣般的笑声。查理又着急又不知所措，他仓促地和他们握了握手，然后把他们介绍给林肯和玛丽恩。玛丽恩点点头，几乎没说话。她朝火炉边退了一步，她的小女儿站在她身边，玛丽恩用一只胳膊搂着她的肩膀。

查理对这两个不速之客越来越感到不耐烦，他等着他们说明来由。邓肯定了定神说道：

“我们是来请你出去吃饭的。我和洛琳都坚持认为，到处打听你的地址这种无聊的事该到此为止了。”

查理进一步靠近他们，好像要逼着他们从走廊里退出去。

“不好意思，我去不了。告诉我你们准备去哪儿，半个小时后，我打电话给你们。”

他的话根本没有用。洛琳一屁股坐到一张椅子边上，眼睛盯着理查德，大声嚷道：“哇，多漂亮的小男孩啊！到我这儿来，小孩。”理查德看看母亲，一动也没有动。洛琳夸张地耸耸肩，回过头来对查理说：“来吃饭吧，相信你小姨子和你连襟不会介意的。难得见你一次，或者说难得见你这么假正经啊。”

“我去不了，”查理断然拒绝，“你们俩吃去吧，我会给你们打电话。”

她立刻翻脸不认人了。“好吧，我们走。但是，我记得，有一次你在凌晨四点钟就来砸我的房门，我对你可是够客气的，还请你喝了一杯呢。邓克，快走吧。”

他们依旧磨磨蹭蹭，踉踉跄跄，但终于怒容满面、不情不愿地从走廊里出去了。

“晚安。”查理说。

“晚安！”洛琳没好气地答道。

他回到客厅里时，玛丽恩还坐在原来的位子没动，只不过现在她的儿子站在了她的另一只臂弯里。林肯依然像钟摆一样将霍诺丽雅荡来荡去。

“岂有此理！”查理突然发起火来，“简直是岂有此理！”

他们两人都没吱声。查理一下子坐到扶手椅上，将林肯之前递给他的那杯酒端起来，又放下，说：

“这两个人真是神经病，我已经两年没有见过他们了——”

他闭上嘴巴不说了。玛丽恩怒不可遏，狠狠地“哼”了一声，猛然转身，拂袖而去。

林肯小心翼翼地将霍诺丽雅放下来。

“你们小孩子们进屋去喝汤吧。”他说。孩子们听话地离开了。他对查理说：

“玛丽恩身体不好，她受不了打击。那种人真的会让她犯病的。”

“不是我让他们来的，他们不知道从什么人那里套出了你的名字，他们故意——”

“好了，情况很糟糕。你这样说无济于事。对不起，失陪一下。”

查理被孤零零地撂在客厅里，他紧张地坐在椅子上。他听见孩子们在隔壁房间里一边吃东西，一边用单音节词简单地说着话，他们已经把发生在大人们之间的事情抛在脑后了。他听见较远的那个房间里传来低声的谈话，接着听见电话听筒被人拿起来时发出的嘀嘀嘀的铃声。他感到一阵心慌，走到房间的另一侧，以免自己无意间偷听到他们的谈话。

不一会儿，林肯回到客厅。“听着，查理，我想我们还是取消今天的晚饭吧，玛丽恩的情况不好。”

“她是在生我的气吗？”

“有点，”他几乎不客气地说，“她意志不够坚定，而——”

“你的意思是说，关于霍诺丽雅的事，她改变主意了吗？”

“她现在非常难受，我不知道她怎么想。明天你打我银行的电话。”

“我希望你替我解释一下，我压根没有想到这两个人会来这儿，我和你们一样难受。”

“我现在什么都不能向她解释。”

查理站起来，拿起外套和帽子，开始向走廊走去。然后他打开餐厅的门，声音怪怪地说：“孩子们，晚安。”

霍诺丽雅站起来，绕过桌子，跑过来拥抱他。

“晚安，小甜心。”他怅然若失地说。然后，他尽量让自己的声音显得柔和一点，像是要安抚什么似的说：“晚安，亲爱的孩子们。”





五


查理径直去了丽兹酒吧，他余怒未消，决心找洛琳和邓肯算账。但是他们不在那儿，他意识到，无论如何，他都挽回不了局面了。他没有喝彼得斯家的那杯酒，而现在，他要了一杯威士忌苏打。保尔过来和他打招呼。

“变化很大，”他伤心地说，“我们的生意大概只有以前的一半。我听说很多人回到美国后赔得精光，可能在第一次大跌中还没赔干净，但是在第二次大跌中就变得一无所有了。我听说你的朋友乔治·哈特赔得一个子儿都不剩了。你要回美国吗？”

“不回，我在布拉格有生意。”

“我听说你在那次大跌中赔了不少。”

“是的，”他气恼地接着说，“但是暴涨的时候，我反而赔光了。”

“你清仓了。”

“算是吧。”

他又想起了那段噩梦似的往事——他想起了他们在旅途中遇到的人；接着想起了那些连简单的加法都不会或者连一句话都说不完整的人。还有轮船派对上的那个矬子，海伦答应和他跳舞，他却在离他们的桌位十英尺的地方侮辱她；还有那些因为耍酒疯、犯毒瘾、大呼小叫而被轰出公共场所的女人和姑娘们——

那些将妻子锁在门外让她们遭受风雪的男人们，因为一九二九年的风雪不是真正的风雪，如果你不想让外面飘雪，有钱就行了。

他走到电话机旁，拨通了彼得斯家的电话，林肯接了电话。

“我打电话是因为我一直放不下这件事。玛丽恩有没有明确表态？”

“玛丽恩病了，”林肯长话短说，“我知道这件事不全是你的错，可是我不能让她因为这件事而崩溃。这件事恐怕得往后拖个一年半载；我不能冒这样的风险了，免得再把她弄成这个样子。”

“我理解。”

“对不起，查理。”

他回到桌子旁，杯子里的威士忌已经空了，但是当艾利克斯用询问的眼神看着酒杯时，他摇摇头。现在除了送给霍诺丽雅一些礼物，他也做不了什么了。明天，他要多送她些东西。他非常懊恼，心想这都是钱惹的祸——他的钱给过多少人啊……

“不，不喝了，”他对另一个侍者说，“我该付多少钱？”

他总有一天会回来的，他们不能让他付出一辈子的代价。他只是想要自己的孩子，除此之外，一切都毫无意义。他不再年轻，不再做梦，不再想入非非。他绝对相信海伦是不愿看到他如此孤独的。

疯狂的礼拜天


一


礼拜天并不是一个日子，而是夹在另外两天中的一道缝隙。对他们来说，除了礼拜天以外的日子是这样的：布置背景和摄像镜头，在吊着麦克风的起重机下面漫长的等待，开着汽车每天在县镇来回颠簸上百英里，在会议室里和足智多谋的竞争对手明争暗斗，没完没了的妥协，以及为了生存而进行着的各种人格的冲突和较量。现在是礼拜天，又开启了私人生活模式，前一天下午还目光呆滞的眼睛，此刻却激情洋溢。时间一小时一小时地慢慢消逝，人们仿佛玩具店里的“小精灵”一样恍然醒悟，他们在角落里激昂陈词，情侣们则躲到大厅里拥抱接吻。大家都怀着这样的心情：“快点，还不算太晚，可是，看在上帝的分上，趁这四十个无忧无虑的休闲时辰尚未结束，莫失良机啊。”

乔尔·科尔斯正在创作分镜头电影剧本。他二十八岁，还没有被好莱坞压垮。自从他六个月前来到这里，已经接到了被认为不错的创作任务。他怀着满腔热情递交了自己创作的场景剧本和分镜头剧本。他谦虚地自称为粗制滥造的职业文人，而实际上心里可不是这样想的。他母亲曾经是一位成功的演员；乔尔的童年时代就是在伦敦和纽约度过的，他努力想把现实和虚构的世界区分开来，或者说至少可以让他为未来做些打算。他模样俊朗，有一双快乐的棕色眼睛，这双眼睛就像他母亲一九一三年注视着百老汇的观众们时的那双眼睛。

接到请帖的时候，他确信自己已经小有成就了。平常，他礼拜天的时候并不出门，而是保持头脑清醒，把工作带回家里做。最近，他接了一个尤金·奥尼尔的剧本，这是特地给一个非常重要的女士量身打造的。到目前为止，他所做的一切都让迈尔斯·凯尔曼非常满意，而迈尔斯·凯尔曼是片场唯一一个工作不受人监管，只对投资人负责的导演。在乔尔的职业生涯中，一切都称心如意。（“我是凯尔曼先生的秘书。礼拜天下午四点到六点，您能来参加茶会吗——他家住在比弗利山庄，街牌号是……”）

乔尔觉得受宠若惊。那是个上流社会的派对。他能受到邀请是对他的一种认可，说明他是个前途无可限量的年轻人。像马里恩·戴维斯夫妇那帮人，时尚圈里的那些人，那些腰缠万贯的大佬们，也许甚至连迪特里希、嘉宝以及侯爵夫人——那些在普通场合难得一见的人物，大概都会来参加凯尔曼家的派对的。

“我一滴酒都不沾。”他向自己保证。凯尔曼非常讨厌酒鬼，他觉得这个行业离不开酒鬼是件令人遗憾的事。

从事写作的人都纵酒无度，乔尔也同意这个观点——他本人就是如此。然而，今天下午他不会喝酒。他希望当他干脆利落、毫不含糊地说“不，谢谢！”来拒绝别人递给他的鸡尾酒时，迈尔斯就站在旁边，可以听到。

迈尔斯·凯尔曼的宅邸是为了激动人心的伟大时刻而建造的——那里有一种倾听的氛围，景色开阔，寂静幽深，仿佛观众就隐藏在里面。然而今天下午，这里却人头攒动，仿佛人们都是急不可耐地竞相投奔而来，而不是应主人的邀请而来的。乔尔骄傲地发现，人群中除了他之外，只有另外两个电影公司的作家，一个是被封为贵族的英国佬，另一个是纳特·吉奥。纳特·吉奥的到来多少让他感到有点吃惊，因为纳特·吉奥曾经激起凯尔曼对酒鬼的指责。

斯特拉·凯尔曼（当然她的原名叫斯特拉·沃克）与乔尔交谈之后没有马上去招呼其他客人。她逗留在他身边——以动人心魄的眼神看着他，似乎想得到某种赞美，而乔尔从他母亲那里继承的戏剧天分立刻就派上了用场：“哇哦，您看起来大约只有十六岁，您的玩具车呢？”

她的喜悦之情溢于言表，依然待在他身边。他觉得应该再说点什么，说点自信轻松的话题——他第一次遇见她是在纽约，当时她正在为生计而挣扎。这时，有人端过来一个托盘，斯特拉将一杯鸡尾酒递到他的手里。

“大家都很谨慎，是吗？”他心不在焉地看着酒杯说，“每个人都在观察，看别人会不会出错，或者每个人都想确保能和给自己增光添彩的人在一起。当然，在贵府，情况并非如此。”他赶忙为自己掩饰，“我只是想说，在好莱坞，情况一般都是这样。”

斯特拉表示赞同。她为乔尔引荐了几个人，仿佛他是非常重要的客人。他确定迈尔斯在房间的另一边，才喝了这杯鸡尾酒。

“这么说您有孩子了？”他说，“那你可要当心了。一位漂亮的太太生完第一个孩子后，身体会变得非常虚弱。她要想对自己的魅力抱有信心，就得让一个新的男人对她毫无保留地献殷勤，来证明她依然妖娆迷人。”

“我可从来没有得到任何男人毫无保留的殷勤。”斯特拉愤懑地说。

“他们是怕您的丈夫。”

“你真是这么想的吗？”这种想法让她皱起了眉头。接着，他们的谈话被打断了，而这正是乔尔所希望的。

她的关注使他信心倍增。他可不是那种只会待在安全的人群中，溜到房间里四处寻找熟人，躲在他们的羽翼下寻求庇护的人。他走到窗户边，望着窗外慵懒的夕阳下苍茫的太平洋。这里很好——美国的海滨度假胜地以及所有的一切，要是有时间好好欣赏就好了。房间里有英俊帅气、穿着考究的人们，可爱的姑娘们，以及——哦，可爱的姑娘们。你不可能应有尽有。

他看见斯特拉清新的、孩童般的脸庞，眼皮疲惫地微微下垂，她在客人中间周旋。他想和她坐下来促膝长谈，就像她是个普通的姑娘一样，而不是现在的名人身份。他的目光追随着她，想看看她给予别人的关注是否和他得到的一样多。他又喝了一杯鸡尾酒——不是因为他需要信心，而是因为她给予了他那么多的信心。然后，他在导演的母亲身边坐了下来。

“您的儿子一定会成为一个传奇人物的，凯尔曼夫人——他是一位哲人，是一位应运而生或类似这样的人。就我个人而言，我并不支持他，但我属于少数派。您觉得您的儿子怎么样？您觉得他很了不起吗？他那么成功，您感到意外吗？”

“不，我不感到意外，”她平静地说，“我们一直对迈尔斯寄予厚望。”

“哦，真是不同寻常，”乔尔说，“我一直以为所有母亲都和拿破仑的母亲一样。我母亲就不希望我和娱乐业有任何瓜葛。她希望我去上西点军校，还要保证平安无恙。”

“我们一直对迈尔斯充满信心。”……

他和好脾气、酒量大、报酬高的纳特·吉奥站在餐厅内的吧台旁。

“——我今年挣了十万，赌输了四万，因此，现在我聘请了一位财产经理人。”

“你是说代理人吧。”乔尔说。

“不，我也聘请了代理人。我说的是财产经理人。我把所有财产都转交给我太太了，让他和我太太一起打理我的财产。我每年付给他五千块钱让他帮我管理我的钱。”

“你说的是你的代理人吧。”

“不，我说的是财产经理人。我不是唯一这么干的人——许多不善理财的人也都聘请了财产经理人。”

“呃，如果你不善理财，那为什么还那么精明地聘请了一个财产经理人呢？”

“我只是赌博的时候管不住自己而已。你听——”

一名歌手在演唱；乔尔和纳特随着人群走上前去。





二


歌声隐隐约约地传到乔尔的耳朵里，他觉得很开心，对参加派对的所有人都很友好。他们是有勇气、肯拼搏的人，比中产阶级优秀多了，而中产阶级在无知和随遇而安方面则游刃有余。这里的人只用十年时间就跻身于这个国家最显赫的上流社会，他们就该被邀请来热情款待一番。他喜欢他们，爱他们。美好的感情如浪潮一般在他的内心深处激荡着。

歌手演唱完毕，众人涌到女主人身边向她辞行，乔尔萌发出一个想法。他愿意为他们表演自己的作品《树立信心》。他就只有这么一个小把戏，曾经在几个派对上逗人开怀，这次说不定也能博取斯特拉·沃克开怀一笑呢。他就这样心血来潮，激情澎湃地急于表现一番，他找到她。

“好极了，”她大声说，“请开始吧！需要帮忙吗？”

“得有个秘书，我要口述。”

“我来当秘书。”

消息传开了，大厅里已经穿上外套准备离开的客人们又折了回来，乔尔面前有许多双陌生的眼睛。他有一种隐隐的不祥的预感，他意识到刚才表演节目的那个人是著名的广播娱乐节目主持人。然后有人发出“嘘”的声音，示意大家保持安静。他单独和斯特拉待在一起，处在一个印第安人的那种不祥的半圆中心。斯特拉满怀期待地朝他微笑着——他开始表演了。

他的表演是对独立制片人戴夫·希尔弗斯坦先生缺乏文化修养的嘲弄。剧中的希尔弗斯坦正在口述一封信，简要讲述他如何处理买来的一个故事：

“一个关于离婚、年轻的开创者和外籍军团的故事，”他听见自己的声音在用希尔弗斯坦先生的口吻说话，“但是我们必须树立信心，明白吗？”

他心里涌起一阵强烈的质疑。围着他的一张张面孔在温和的灯光下既急切又好奇，然而却没有一丝笑意。在他的正前方，那位伟大的“银幕情人”的眼珠子鼓得像土豆芽眼似的怒视着他。只有斯特拉·沃克光彩照人，毫不怀疑地微笑着，抬头看着他。

“如果我们把他塑造成门吉欧那样的形象，那么我们就只能看到一个带有火奴鲁鲁风情的迈克尔·阿兰。”

前面的人依然毫无反应，后面的人则骚动起来，有一拨人明显在朝左边大门的方向移动。

“——然后，她说她觉得自己对他具有性魅力，他却筋疲力尽了，说道：‘见鬼，你自己堕落去吧’——”

他听见纳特·吉奥在某个地方窃笑，偶尔也有几张令人感到鼓舞的面容。然而，故事讲完的时候，他意识到自己当着电影圈内这些炙手可热的重要人物的面做了一次傻事，而他的前途和事业偏偏就攥在他们的手心里。

有那么一刻，人们沉寂得令他心慌意乱，然而很快人群就朝门口涌去，打破了这种沉寂。他感觉到在人们的飞短流长中涌动着一股嘲笑的暗流；接着——一切都发生在十秒钟之内——那位伟大的“银幕情人”的眼神像针眼一样凌厉而空洞，他“呸、呸”地叫着，大声喝着倒彩，他的感受代表了整个人群的情绪。这是专业人员对业余人士的憎恨，是一个固有的团体对一个陌生的闯入者的憎恨，是一个庞大的帮派集体释放出的贬损和轻蔑。

只有斯特拉·沃克依然站在他的身边，对他表示感谢，似乎他取得了无与伦比的成功，似乎她压根都没有想过会有人不喜欢他的表演。纳特·吉奥帮他披上外套，一阵自我厌弃的巨浪席卷而来，他绝望地坚持住自己的一贯性原则：永远都不要将这种自卑的情绪流露出来，直到把它消灭为止。

“我彻底完了，”他故作轻松地对斯特拉说，“不过不要紧，喜欢的人还是挺多的。谢谢您的配合。”

她始终面带微笑——他像醉汉似的鞠了一躬，纳特拽着他向门口走去……

送早餐的人将他唤醒，也将他置于崩溃和毁灭的境地。昨天他还依然故我，还是对抗这个行业的一团火焰；今天，他却感到自己大势已去，那些面孔，那些轻蔑的表情，所有人的嘲笑将他压垮了。更糟糕的是，在迈尔斯·凯尔曼的眼中，他变成了一个醉鬼，他丢尽了颜面，凯尔曼会因为不得不聘用他而感到后悔。而对于斯特拉·沃克而言，他迫使她为了保住家庭的体面而不得不成为一个殉道者，一个牺牲品——他不敢去揣测她会做何感想。他没有胃口了，将他要的水煮蛋放回电话桌上，开始写信：

亲爱的迈尔斯：

您可以想象我内心深处的自责。我承认我有点表现主义，但是，在下午六点钟，在光天化日之下！上帝啊！请允许我向您的太太致歉！

您永远的

乔尔·科尔斯

乔尔从片场的办公室里出来，像罪犯一样偷偷溜进烟草店里。他的行为非常可疑，因此电影制片厂的一个保安要求检查他的出入证。他决定在外面吃午餐。这时，纳特自信满满、欢呼雀跃地追上他。

“你说你永远歇菜了，你这是什么意思？即使那个‘三件套’真的给你喝了倒彩，那又怎么样？”

“嗨，听着，”他把乔尔拽进电影制片厂的饭馆里，接着说，“一天晚上，他在格劳曼剧场首次亮相。在他向观众鞠躬的时候，乔·斯夸尔斯踢了他一脚。这个拙劣的演员说他随后会给乔打电话。然而，第二天八点的时候，乔给他打电话说‘我原以为会接到你的电话’，他却把电话挂了。”

这个荒唐可笑的故事使乔尔振作起来，他看着邻桌那群在一部反映马戏团的电影中扮演角色的人——一对忧伤可爱的连体双胞胎，几个卑贱的侏儒，一个狂傲自大的巨人症患者，他感到一丝隐隐的安慰。然而，当他的目光越过这群人，看到一群脸上长着黄色雀斑的漂亮女人，她们涂着睫毛膏，眼神忧郁，一惊一乍，整日穿着艳俗的宫廷礼袍，他认出里面有他在凯尔曼家见过的人，又畏缩起来了。

“以后再也不参加那种派对了，”他大声说，“那绝对是我最后一次参加好莱坞的社交活动！”

第二天一早，他发现办公室里有封电报：

您是我们派对上最令人愉快的人之一。下个礼拜天，希望您能参加我妹妹琼的自助晚餐。

斯特拉·沃克·凯尔曼

在这令人激动的时刻，他感到热血沸腾。他将信将疑地又看了一遍电报。

“哦，这是我这辈子听到的最称心如意的消息！”





三


又到了疯狂的礼拜天。乔尔睡到十一点才起床。他看了一份报纸，了解一周以来的消息。他在家吃了午饭：鲑鳟鱼、鳄梨沙拉、一品托加利福尼亚酒。他开始为参加茶会精心打扮。他挑了一件细格子纹西服，一件蓝色衬衫，一条鲜艳的橙色领带。他的两只眼睛下面有两个因疲劳形成的黑眼圈。他开着二手车朝里维埃拉公寓驶去。他向斯特拉的妹妹做自我介绍的时候，迈尔斯和斯特拉穿着骑马装进来了——他们在回比弗利山庄的那条尘土飞扬的路上吵得不可开交，差不多吵了整整一个下午。

迈尔斯·凯尔曼，个子很高，精神紧张，脾气坏得令人绝望，有着乔尔以前从未见过的忧郁眼神。他是一位艺术家，从他那形状奇特的头顶到他那黑人似的脚指头都透着艺术气息。他稳稳地用自己那黑人似的脚站着——他从来不拍小成本电影，即使有时候他会因为拍摄豪华大片所导致的尝试性失败付出沉重的代价。尽管有他在场让人觉得蓬荜生辉，然而人们很快就能发现，他不是一个正常的健康人。

从他们进来的那一刻起，乔尔的时光就自然而然、不可避免地和他们密不可分了。他加入围着他们的一群人当中，斯特拉却抽身离去，还不耐烦地咋着舌头——而迈尔斯·凯尔曼在和碰巧站在他身边的那个人说话：

“别再谈伊娃·戈贝尔了吧，回家后我少不了为她的事烦心呢。”迈尔斯转身对乔尔说：“不好意思，昨天在办公室没有见到你。我在精神病医生的诊所里度过了一个下午。”

“你在接受精神治疗吗？”

“已经治疗几个月了。起先，我得了幽闭恐惧症，现在我想进行全面的治疗。他们说这需要一年多时间。”

“你的生活没有任何问题呀。”乔尔安慰他说。

“哦，没有问题吗？呃，斯特拉似乎觉得有问题。不过，问别的任何人——他们都会说没问题。”他苦涩地说。

一个姑娘坐在了迈尔斯的椅子扶手上；乔尔向斯特拉走过去，她愁眉苦脸地站在火炉旁。

“谢谢您给我发电报，”他说，“您真是太好了。我无法想象像您这样的大美人竟然会如此宽容仁慈。”

她比他以前见到她的时候更可爱，也许是因为他的眼神流露出排山倒海的崇拜促使她向他吐露心声——他们交往的时间并不长，也许是因为她显然正处于感情的爆发点上。

“两年以来，迈尔斯一直都带着这个贱人，我从来都不知情。哦，她是我最好的朋友之一，常常待在我家。最后，人们把真相告诉了我，迈尔斯才不得不承认。”

她意气用事地坐在乔尔的椅子扶手上。她的马裤的颜色和椅子的颜色相同，乔尔发现，她头发浓密，像金色的波浪，还一缕深一缕浅的，肯定不是染出来的。她素面朝天，不施粉黛，真是出水芙蓉，天生丽质啊——

斯特拉因为她的意外发现而气得发抖，她觉得无法忍受一个新人围着迈尔斯的场面。于是她把乔尔领进卧室，他们俩分别坐在一张大床的两头继续谈话。去洗手间的人朝里面窥探着，说着风凉话，然而，斯特拉全然不予理睬，一门心思地倾诉着自己的苦衷。过了一会儿，迈尔斯把头伸进来说：“想和乔尔说清楚是怎么回事，半个小时是不够的，连我自己都弄不懂，精神医生说需要整整一年才能弄清楚呢。”

她继续诉苦，仿佛迈尔斯不存在一样。她爱迈尔斯，她说——她克服重重困难，一直对他忠贞不贰。

“精神医生告诉迈尔斯，他有恋母情结。在他的第一次婚姻里，他将恋母情结转移到妻子身上，你知道——然后他将性爱给了我。然而，我们结婚后，同样的事情重演了——他将恋母情结转移到我身上，而将他的力比多都给了另外一个女人。”

乔尔知道斯特拉的话不可能是胡言乱语——然而听起来却很像是胡言乱语。他认识伊娃·戈贝尔，她是一个慈母般的女人，比斯特拉年龄大，可能也比她聪明。而斯特拉与她相比简直就是个金娃娃。

这时，迈尔斯不耐烦地提议，让乔尔跟他们一起回家，因为斯特拉要说的话太多了。于是，他们驱车回到比弗利山庄的宅邸。在高高的天花板下面，情况似乎变得更加严峻，更加具有悲剧意味。这是个十分怪异的明亮的夜晚，所有的窗子将黑暗严严实实地挡在了外面。斯特拉在房子里面大发雷霆，又哭又叫。乔尔并不十分相信女电影演员们的悲伤。她们具有志得意满的另一面——她们都是金玫瑰般的大美人，被作家和导演吹捧得活力四射，她们可以一连几个小时围坐在一起，说着悄悄话，别有用意地咯咯发笑，讲着发生在她们身上的各种奇遇。

有时候他假装在听，实际上却在想她打扮得多么精致——和她的两条腿十分相称的漂亮英气的马裤，意大利米色高领开衫，褐色的羚羊皮夹克。他无法断定是她在模仿英国的富贵女子，还是英国的富贵女子在模仿她。她在介于最真实的现实与最露骨的表演之间的某个中间地带游走徘徊。

“迈尔斯非常嫉妒我，无论我做什么，他都疑神疑鬼。”她轻蔑地大声说，“我在纽约的时候给他写信，说我和艾迪·贝克一起去看了一场电影，迈尔斯非常嫉妒，竟然在一天内给我打了十次电话。”

“我当时简直要发疯了，”迈尔斯使劲抽了一下鼻子说，他一紧张就会这样，“害得精神医生用了一个礼拜的时间都没弄明白是怎么回事。”

斯特拉绝望地摇摇头。“你希望我一连三个礼拜都坐在宾馆里吗？”

“我什么都不希望。我承认我很嫉妒。我尽力克制了。我和布里奇贝恩博士一起努力了，都没有效果。今天下午你坐到乔尔的椅子扶手上时，我很嫉妒他。”

“是吗？”她吃惊地说，“你也会嫉妒！难道没有人坐到你的椅子扶手上吗？整整两个小时，你和我说过一句话吗？”

“你在卧室里向乔尔诉苦呢。”

“我一想到那个女人——”她似乎以为不说出伊娃·戈贝尔的名字就能减轻她实际上的痛苦，“——以前常常来我们家——”

“好了——好了，”迈尔斯厌恶地说，“我已经全都承认了，我和你一样，感觉糟透了。”他转身和乔尔谈论电影，斯特拉则两手插在裤袋里，沿着墙，远远地踱着步子。

“他们对迈尔斯非常不好。”她说。她突然插入他们的谈话当中，仿佛他们从来都没有谈过她的私人问题似的。“亲爱的，把老贝尔策要改动你的电影的事告诉他。”

她以保护神的姿态为迈尔斯挺身而出的时候，她的眼睛为了迈尔斯而闪射出怒不可遏的火焰，乔尔意识到自己爱上她了。他兴奋得不能自持，立即起身告辞。

一个礼拜从礼拜一开始进入工作状态，这与礼拜天的夸夸其谈、流言蜚语和绯闻丑事形成了鲜明的对比。电影脚本的细节修改没完没了——“我们可以把她的声音保留到声道上，从贝尔的角度取一个出租车的中景，或者干脆把镜头拉回来，将车站也拍进去，让画面定格一会儿，再取一排出租车的长景，以避免蹩脚的溶景。”——到了礼拜一下午，乔尔竟忘了，从事娱乐行业的人也永远享有娱乐的特权。晚上，他拨通了迈尔斯家的电话。他找迈尔斯，斯特拉却跑过来接电话。

“感觉好点了吗？”

“不怎么好。下个礼拜六你有什么安排吗？”

“没什么安排。”

“佩里夫妇要举行晚宴和戏剧表演派对。迈尔斯不去——他要飞往南本德去看圣母队和加州队的比赛。我想也许你可以替他陪我去。”

过了好一会儿，乔尔才说：“呃——当然没问题。如果要开讨论会的话，我就不能去赴宴了，不过我可以去参加戏剧表演派对。”

“那么，我们就可以一去啰。”

乔尔在办公室里踱着步子，由于凯尔曼夫妇的关系比较紧张，迈尔斯会高兴吗？或者她压根就打算让迈尔斯蒙在鼓里？这绝对办不到——如果迈尔斯不提此事，乔尔也会告诉他的。当他静下心来重新投入工作时，一个多小时已经过去了。

礼拜三有一场四个小时的讨论会，会议室里群星荟萃，烟雾缭绕。三个男人和一个女人轮番走上地毯，有人提出建议，有人进行指责，有人厉声呵斥，有人谆谆诱导，有人自信满满，有人绝望失意。最后，乔尔留下来和迈尔斯谈心。

这个男人很疲惫——不是那种兴奋后的精疲力竭，而是对生活本身的厌倦，他眼皮松弛，满脸胡须，把整个嘴部埋进蓝色的阴影里。

“听说你准备乘飞机去看圣母队的比赛。”

迈尔斯的眼光越过他的头顶，摇摇头。

“我已经改变主意了。”

“为什么？”

“因为你。”他依然不看乔尔。

“你在说什么，到底怎么了，迈尔斯？”

“这就是我改变主意的原因。”他突然故作开心地爆发出一阵自嘲式的笑声，“我不明白斯特拉这么做是不是出于对我的鄙视——她邀请你陪她去佩里家，是吗？我可没有心思去欣赏那场比赛了。”

迈尔斯具有良好的导演天资，他拍摄电影时既机敏又充满自信，然而这种禀赋在应付他的私人生活方面却显得轻弱而又无可奈何。

“听着，迈尔斯，”乔尔皱着眉头说，“我从来没有挑逗过斯特拉。如果你因为我的缘故要取消行程，我不会陪她去佩里家，也不会去见她。你大可以放心。”

迈尔斯仔细地看着他。

“也许吧，”他耸耸肩，“无论如何，总会有别人的。我已经开心不起来了。”

“你对斯特拉似乎缺乏信心。她告诉我她一直对你忠贞不贰。”

“也许是这样。”在这最后几分钟里，迈尔斯的嘴部肌肉终于松弛下来了，“但是，发生了那种事情以后，我还怎么有资格向她要求什么呢？我怎么能指望她——”他不说了，接下来说话的时候，他的脸绷得紧紧的，“不妨告诉你，对也好，错也罢，也不管我做了什么，如果我还要对她做什么的话，那就是和她离婚。我不允许我的自尊受到伤害——离婚是最后一步棋。”

他的腔调激怒了乔尔，不过他说道：

“难道她还没有从伊娃·戈贝尔的事情中冷静下来吗？”

“没有。”迈尔斯抽了一下鼻子，悲观地说，“我也无法冷静下来。”

“我以为事情都过去了。”

“我尽量不再和伊娃见面，但是你知道，这种事情要放下有多难——她不是昨天夜里我在出租车里随便亲吻的女孩子！精神医生说——”

“我已经知道了，”乔尔打断他的话，“斯特拉告诉我了。”这真是令人沮丧。“哦，如果你去看比赛，我想我也不会去见斯特拉。而且我相信斯特拉没有辜负任何人。”

“也许是这样。”迈尔斯无精打采地重复着说。“不管怎样，我会留下来，陪她去参加聚会。嗨，”他突然说，“希望你也来。我得有个理解我的人聊聊天。麻烦就在这里——我在各个方面都对斯特拉施加了影响，特别是，她受到我的影响，凡是我喜欢的男人，她也都喜欢——这事很难办。”

“一定是这样的。”乔尔表示赞同。

乔尔没能出席晚宴。他戴着丝质礼帽看着那些失业的人，觉得很不自在。他在好莱坞大剧院前面一边等人，一边观察晚上大街上的行人：拙劣地模仿那些光鲜靓丽、特别能吸人眼球的电影明星的人们，穿着马球服的跛脚男人，留着胡子、拿着权杖、步履有力的托钵僧人，两个大学生打扮的时髦的菲律宾人。此情此景让人觉得共和国的这个角落是对全世界开放的，这里似乎在举行一场声势宏大、队伍浩荡的嘉年华，而实际上是在举行一个校友会的宣誓仪式。两辆气派的豪华轿车从队伍中穿过，停在了人行道边。

是她！她穿着一条冰水似的裙子，上面有千千万万个浅蓝色的图案，领口处是滴着水滴的冰柱图案。他走上前去。

“这么说，你喜欢我的裙子啰？”

“迈尔斯呢？”

“他还是飞去看比赛了。昨天一早就走了——至少我认为——”她不说了，“我刚收到一封从南本德发来的电报，说他准备回来。我忘了——这些人你都认识吧？”

一行八个人走进了大剧院。

迈尔斯还是走了，乔尔不知道他自己该不该来。然而在表演的过程中，看着斯特拉亮闪闪的浅色头发下面优美的身体轮廓，他再也不去想迈尔斯了。有一次，他转身看着她，她也回头看着他，微笑着，与他的目光相接，让他想看多久就看多久。在表演的间隙，他们到休息室去抽烟，她小声说：

“他们都要去参加杰克·约翰逊的夜总会开幕式——我不想去，你呢？”

“我们必须去吗？”

“我想并非如此。”她迟疑地说，“我喜欢和你聊天。我想我们可以去我家——如果我能确定——”

她又迟疑了，乔尔问：

“确定什么？”

“确定——呃，我知道我的脑子很乱，可是我怎么能确定迈尔斯去看比赛了呢？”

“你的意思是说，你以为迈尔斯和伊娃·戈贝尔在一起吗？”

“不，不全是这个意思——不过，要是他在这里监视我的一举一动呢？你知道迈尔斯有时候不按常理出牌。有一次，他想让一个长胡子的人陪他喝茶，他就去选角公司找了一个，然后和他喝了整整一个下午的茶。”

“这是两码事。他从南本德给你发来了电报——这证明他在那里看比赛嘛。”

表演派对结束后，他们在人行道上向大伙告别，人们纷纷投来意味深长的目光。他们悄悄地从围绕着斯特拉的人群中抽出身，并沿着那条金色的星光大道走去。

“你知道他会派人去发电报的，”斯特拉说，“这非常容易。”

这话不假。鉴于这一点，她的担心也不无道理。乔尔很生气：如果迈尔斯已经把目标对准他们，那么他也没有必要对迈尔斯尽什么义务了。他大声说：

“真蠢。”

商店的橱窗里已经装饰了圣诞树，林荫大道上空的满月像一个布景，美得像闺房角落里亮起的一盏巨大的灯笼。步入比弗利山庄幽暗的大树下，里面像白天的桉树一样光影闪烁，乔尔就只能看到在他自己的脸庞下面，闪现着她那雪白的脸以及她的肩膀的弧线。她突然从他身边走开，抬头看着他。

“你的眼睛和你母亲的很像，”她说，“我以前有一本剪贴本，里面贴满了她的照片。”

“你的眼睛独一无二，谁的也不像。”他答道。

他们进屋的时候，有什么东西引起了乔尔的警觉，他小心翼翼地在地上查看了一遍，仿佛迈尔斯正潜伏在灌木林里似的。大厅的桌子上躺着一封电报。她大声念起来：

芝加哥

明晚回来。想你。爱你。

迈尔斯

“你看，”她将电报扔到桌子上说，“他不费吹灰之力就能伪造一封电报。”她吩咐管家准备酒和三明治，然后跑到楼上。乔尔则走进空荡荡的客厅，在里面踱着步子，不经意间走到那架钢琴旁。两个礼拜以前，他也曾站在这里，丢尽了颜面。

“那么我们的滑稽剧就可以大功告成了，”他大声说，“一个关于离婚、年轻的开创者和外籍军团的故事。”

他忽然想到了另一封电报。

“您是我们派对上最令人愉快的人之一——”

他有了一个想法。如果斯特拉的电报纯粹只是出于礼节的话，那么迈尔斯很可能是促使她发电报的人，因为迈尔斯曾经邀请过他。迈尔斯大概会说：

“给他发一封电报吧——他很苦恼——他觉得自己自毁前程了。”

这也正好印证了迈尔斯的话：“我在各个方面都对斯特拉施加了影响，特别是，她受到我的影响，凡是我喜欢的男人，她也都喜欢。”一个女人愿意这么做，是出于同情心——而只有男人这么做才是出于责任心。

当斯特拉回到房间里时，他牵起她的两只手。

“我有一种奇怪的感觉，你在和迈尔斯玩游戏，你想让他吃醋，而我则是受人利用的那只火中取栗的猫爪子。”他说。

“你自己随便喝一杯吧。”

“可是，奇怪的是，我竟然爱上你了。”

电话铃响了，她正好趁机抽出身来去接电话。

“迈尔斯又发来一封电报，”她大声说，“他从堪萨斯机场发来的，或者说据说是他从那里发来的。”

“我想他是想要我记住他。”

“不，他只说他爱我。我相信他爱我。他非常脆弱。”

“快坐到我身边来。”乔尔催促她说。

时间尚早。半个小时后，还有几分钟就到午夜了。乔尔走到冰冷的壁炉边，简单地说：

“你的意思是你对我不感兴趣？”

“根本不是。你很有魅力，你知道的。问题是，我觉得我真的很爱迈尔斯。”

“显而易见。”

“今天晚上，一切都让我感到不安。”

他没有生气——他甚至感到庆幸，一桩可能发生的感情纠葛得以避免了。他依然看着她，她身体的温度和柔和的线条中和了她那条蓝色裙子给人造成的冰冷感，他知道她将永远成为他的缺憾。

“我得走了，”他说，“我要叫辆出租车。”

“说什么呢——有值班司机。”

他对她随时准备让他离开而感到一阵寒心，她看出了他的心思，轻轻地吻了他一下，说：“你真是个甜心，乔尔。”接着，同时发生了三件事：

他将那杯酒一口喝下去，电话铃响彻了整栋房子，大厅里的钟表敲得像大喇叭一样响：

九——十——十一——十二——





五


又是一个礼拜天。乔尔很清楚，他今晚来到剧院时，这个礼拜的工作还多得像寿衣一样挂在他的脖子上。他已经向斯特拉表达了爱意，那种情形就像是在一天结束之前，一定要突击完成一件事一样。然而现在是礼拜天——接下来的二十四个小时在他眼前展现出一幅舒心悠闲的景象——每一分钟都意味着要不动声色地、委婉地靠近某个目标，每一刻都孕育着无限的可能性。没有什么是不可能的——一切都刚刚开始。他又喝了一杯。

随着一声痛苦的尖叫，斯特拉滑了一跤，无力地栽倒在电话机旁。乔尔将她扶起来，让她躺在沙发上，用苏打水喷了喷手帕，再用手帕轻轻拍打她的脸。电话仍然在响，他拿起话筒，放在耳边。

“——飞机在堪萨斯坠毁，迈尔斯的尸体已经得到确认，而——”

他挂断电话。

“躺着别动。”看到斯特拉睁开了眼睛，他不说话了。

“哦，发生什么事了？”她小声问，“给他们打回去。哦，发生什么事了？”

“我马上给他们打回去，你的医生叫什么名字？”

“他们说迈尔斯死了吗？”

“乖乖地躺着——楼上有仆人吗？”

“抱住我——我害怕。”

他伸出胳膊抱住她。

“我需要知道你的医生的名字，”他脸色凝重地说，“这可能是个错误，但是我希望这儿有个人陪你。”

“医生——哦，天哪，迈尔斯死了吗？”

乔尔跑到楼上，在陌生的药箱里翻找阿莫尼亚安神片。他从楼上下来的时候，斯特拉大叫起来：

“他没死——我知道他没死。这是他的阴谋，他在折磨我。我知道他活着，我能感觉到他活着。”

“我想给你的好朋友打电话，斯特拉。你今晚不能一个人待在这里。”

“哦，不，”她哭喊道，“我不见任何人。你留下来陪我，我一个朋友都没有。”她站起来，泪如雨下。“哦，迈尔斯是我唯一的朋友。他没死——他不可能死。我马上去看他，坐火车去，你得陪我去。”

“你不能去，今晚什么也做不了。我想让你告诉我一个女人的名字，我好给她打个电话：罗伊斯？琼？卡梅尔？你难道就没有一个女性朋友吗？”

斯特拉茫然地看着他。

“伊娃·戈贝尔是我最好的朋友。”她说。

乔尔想到迈尔斯，想到两天前在办公室的时候他那张悲伤绝望的脸。在他的死亡所带来的可怕的沉寂中，关于他的一切逐渐了然于心。他是唯一一位既有幽默的性格又有艺术家的良知的土生土长的美国导演。由于埋头事业而导致了精神崩溃，却没有灵活应对的能力，不会通过自我解嘲来释放压力，也找不到避身之地——所以他只能选择这种令人扼腕、非常危险的方式进行逃避。

大门响了一声——突然打开了，大厅里响起脚步声。

“迈尔斯！”斯特拉尖叫道，“是你吗？迈尔斯？哦，是迈尔斯。”

一个送电报的男孩出现在门口。

“我找不到门铃，听见你们在里面说活。”

这封电报的内容电话里已经讲过了。斯特拉看了一遍又一遍，仿佛这是一个别有用心的谎言，乔尔开始打电话。时间还早，他很难联系到人。最后他好不容易联系上了几个朋友，他给斯特拉喝了一杯烈性酒。

“你留下来，乔尔。”她小声说，好像差不多游离到梦中了。“你别走，迈尔斯喜欢你——他说你——”她的身体抖得厉害。“哦，天哪，你不知道我有多么孤独。”她闭上眼睛，“抱着我，迈尔斯有一套和你一样的西装。”她突然直挺挺地坐起来，“想想看，他当时是什么感受。他几乎什么都害怕。”

她昏昏沉沉地摇摇头，突然捧住乔尔的脸，让它靠近她的脸。

“你不要走，你喜欢我——你爱我，是吗？不要给任何人打电话。明天有的是时间。你今晚就留在这里陪我。”

他看着她，起初他觉得难以置信，然后，他突然明白了什么。斯特拉试图通过营造一种迈尔斯生前曾经猜测的情景而使他活着——仿佛只要有什么事情让他担心害怕，他的思维就不会停止似的。她为了抗拒他已经死亡的事实，几乎已经心力交瘁，神经错乱了。

乔尔向电话机走去，决心给医生打电话。

“不要，哦，不要给任何人打电话！”斯特拉叫道，“回到这里来，抱着我。”

“贝尔医生在吗？”

“乔尔，”斯特拉叫道，“我以为我可以指靠你。迈尔斯喜欢你。他很嫉妒你——乔尔，到这儿来。”

哎，怎么办——如果他背叛了迈尔斯，她就会觉得迈尔斯还活着——因为如果他真的死了，别人还怎么背叛他呢？

“——受到严重的打击。你能马上过来吗？能带个护士一起来吗？”

“乔尔！”

这个时候，门铃和电话开始接二连三地响起来，一辆辆轿车停到了门前。

“可是你不会离开的，”斯特拉央求道，“你会留下来，是吗？”

“我得走了，”他答道，“但是如果你需要我，我会再回来。”

此刻，这里充满了低沉肃穆的声音，还有匆匆移动的身影，像为人遮风挡雨的树叶一样在死神周围瑟瑟抖动。他站在房前的台阶上，喉咙里响起轻轻的哽咽声。

“他触碰到什么，什么就会出现奇迹，”他想，“他甚至让那个娇小可爱的姑娘活了下来，而且将她打造成了一件杰作。”

然后：

“他在这个该死的蛮荒之地留下了怎样的空洞啊——而且已成定局了！”

然后，他略带酸楚地想：“哦，是的，我会回来的，我会回来的！”





HEAD AND SHOULDERS


I


In 1915 Horace Tarbox was thirteen years old. In that year he took the examinations for entrance to Princeton University and received the Grade A—excellent—in Cæsar, Cicero, Vergil, Xenophon, Homer, Algebra, Plane Geometry, Solid Geometry, and Chemistry.

Two years later while George M. Cohan was composing“Over There,” Horace was leading the sophomore class by several lengths and digging out theses on“The Syllogism as an Obsolete Scholastic Form,” and during the battle of Château-Thierry he was sitting at his desk deciding whether or not to wait until his seventeenth birthday before beginning his series of essays on“The Pragmatic Bias of the New Realists.”

After a while some newsboy told him that the war was over, and he was glad, because it meant that Peat Brothers, publishers, would get out their new edition of“Spinoza's Improvement of the Understanding.” Wars were all very well in their way, made young men self-reliant or something but Horace felt that he could never forgive the President for allowing a brass band to play under his window the night of the false armistice, causing him to leave three important sentences out of his thesis on“German Idealism.”

The next year he went up to Yale to take his degree as Master of Arts.

He was seventeen then, tall and slender, with near-sighted gray eyes and an air of keeping himself utterly detached from the mere words he let drop.

“I never feel as though I'm talking to him,” expostulated Professor Dillinger to a sympathetic colleague. “He makes me feel as though I were talking to his representative. I always expect him to say: ‘Well, I'll ask myself and find out.’”

And then, just as nonchalantly as though Horace Tarbox had been Mr. Beef the butcher or Mr. Hat the haberdasher, life reached in, seized him, handled him, stretched him, and unrolled him like a piece of Irish lace on a Saturday-afternoon bargain-counter.

To move in the literary fashion I should say that this was all because when way back in colonial days the hardy pioneers had come to a bald place in Connecticut and asked of each other, “Now, what shall we build here?” the hardiest one among 'em had answered: “Let's build a town where theatrical managers can try out musical comedies!” How afterward they founded Yale College there, to try the musical comedies on, is a story every one knows. At any rate one December, “Home James”opened at the Shubert, and all the students encored Marcia Meadow, who sang a song about the Blundering Blimp in the first act and did a shaky, shivery, celebrated dance in the last.

Marcia was nineteen. She didn't have wings, but audiences agreed generally that she didn't need them. She was a blonde by natural pigment, and she wore no paint on the streets at high noon. Outside of that she was no better than most women.

It was Charlie Moon who promised her five thousand Pall Malls if she would pay a call on Horace Tarbox, prodigy extraordinary. Charlie was a senior in Sheffield, and he and Horace were first cousins. They liked and pitied each other.

Horace had been particularly busy that night. The failure of the Frenchman Laurier to appreciate the significance of the new realists was preying on his mind. In fact, his only reaction to a low, clear-cut rap at his study was to make him speculate as to whether any rap would have actual existence without an ear there to hear it. He fancied he was verging more and more toward pragmatism. But at that moment, though he did not know it, he was verging with astounding rapidity toward something quite different.

The rap sounded—three seconds leaked by—the rap sounded.

“Come in,” muttered Horace automatically.

He heard the door open and then close, but, bent over his book in the big armchair before the fire, he did not look up.

“Leave it on the bed in the other room,” he said absently.

“Leave what on the bed in the other room?”

Marcia Meadow had to talk her songs, but her speaking voice was like byplay on a harp.

“The laundry.”

“I can't.”

Horace stirred impatiently in his chair.

“Why can't you?”

“Why, because I haven't got it.”

“Hm!” he replied testily. “Suppose you go back and get it.”

Across the fire from Horace was another easy-chair. He was accustomed to change to it in the course of an evening by way of exercise and variety. One chair he called Berkeley, the other he called Hume. He suddenly heard a sound as of a rustling, diaphanous form sinking into Hume. He glanced up.

“Well,” said Marcia with the sweet smile she used in Act Two (“Oh, so the Duke liked my dancing!”), “Well, Omar Khayyam, here I am beside you singing in the wilderness.”

Horace stared at her dazedly. The momentary suspicion came to him that she existed there only as a phantom of his imagination. Women didn't come into men's rooms and sink into men's Humes. Women brought laundry and took your seat in the street-car and married you later on when you were old enough to know fetters.

This woman had clearly materialized out of Hume. The very froth of her brown gauzy dress was art emanation from Hume's leather arm there! If he looked long enough he would see Hume right through her and then be would be alone again in the room. He passed his fist across his eyes. He really must take up those trapeze exercises again.

“For Pete's sake, don't look so critical!” objected the emanation pleasantly. “I feel as if you were going to wish me away with that patent dome of yours. And then there wouldn't be anything left of me except my shadow in your eyes.”

Horace coughed. Coughing was one of his two gestures. When he talked you forgot he had a body at all. It was like hearing a phonograph record by a singer who had been dead a long time.

“What do you want?” he asked.

“I want them letters,” whined Marcia melodramatically—“them letters of mine you bought from my grandsire in 1881.”

Horace considered.

“I haven't got your letters,” he said evenly. “I am only seventeen years old. My father was not born until March 3, 1879. You evidently have me confused with some one else.”

“You're only seventeen?” repeated March suspiciously.

“Only seventeen.”

“I knew a girl,” said Marcia reminiscently, “who went on the ten-twenty-thirty when she was sixteen. She was so stuck on herself that she could never say ‘sixteen’ without putting the ‘only’ before it. We got to calling her ‘Only Jessie.’ And she's just where she was when she started—only worse. ‘Only’ is a bad habit, Omar—it sounds like an alibi.”

“My name is not Omar.”

“I know,” agreed Marcia, nodding—“your name's Horace. I just call you Omar because you remind me of a smoked cigarette.”

“And I haven't your letters. I doubt if I've ever met your grandfather. In fact, I think it very improbable that you yourself were alive in 1881.”

Marcia stared at him in wonder.

“Me—1881? Why sure! I was second-line stuff when the Florodora Sextette was still in the convent. I was the original nurse to Mrs. Sol Smith's Juliette. Why, Omar, I was a canteen singer during the War of 1812.”

Horace's mind made a sudden successful leap, and he grinned.

“Did Charlie Moon put you up to this?”

Marcia regarded him inscrutably.

“Who's Charlie Moon?”

“Small—wide nostrils—big ears.”

She grew several inches and sniffed.

“I'm not in the habit of noticing my friends' nostrils.”

“Then it was Charlie?”

Marcia bit her lip—and then yawned. “Oh, let's change the subject, Omar. I'll pull a snore in this chair in a minute.”

“Yes,” replied Horace gravely, “Hume has often been considered soporific.”

“Who's your friend—and will he die?”

Then of a sudden Horace Tarbox rose slenderly and began to pace the room with his hands in his pockets. This was his other gesture.

“I don't care for this,” he said as if he were talking to himself—“at all. Not that I mind your being here—I don't. You're quite a pretty little thing, but I don't like Charlie Moon's sending you up here. Am I a laboratory experiment on which the janitors as well as the chemists can make experiments? Is my intellectual development humorous in any way? Do I look like the pictures of the little Boston boy in the comic magazines? Has that callow ass, Moon, with his eternal tales about his week in Paris, any right to—”

“No,” interrupted Marcia emphatically. “And you're a sweet boy. Come here and kiss me.”

Horace stopped quickly in front of her.

“Why do you want me to kiss you?” he asked intently. “Do you just go round kissing people?”

“Why, yes,” admitted Marcia, unruffled. “'At's all life is. Just going round kissing people.”

“Well,” replied Horace emphatically, “I must say your ideas are horribly garbled! In the first place life isn't just that, and in the second place I won't kiss you. It might get to be a habit and I can't get rid of habits. This year I've got in the habit of lolling in bed until seven-thirty.”

Marcia nodded understandingly.

“Do you ever have any fun?” she asked.

“What do you mean by fun?”

“See here,” said Marcia sternly, “I like you, Omar, but I wish you'd talk as if you had a line on what you were saying. You sound as if you were gargling a lot of words in your mouth and lost a bet every time you spilled a few. I asked you if you ever had any fun.”

Horace shook his head.

“Later, perhaps,” he answered. “You see I'm a plan. I'm an experiment. I don't say that I don't get tired of it sometimes—I do. Yet—oh, I can't explain! But what you and Charlie Moon call fun wouldn't be fun to me.”

“Please explain.”

Horace stared at her, started to speak and then, changing his mind, resumed his walk. After an unsuccessful attempt to determine whether or not he was looking at her Marcia smiled at him.

“Please explain.”

Horace turned.

“If I do, will you promise to tell Charlie Moon that I wasn't in?”

“Uh-uh.”

“Very well, then. Here's my history: I was a ‘why’ child. I wanted to see the wheels go round. My father was a young economics professor at Princeton. He brought me up on the system of answering every question I asked him to the best of his ability. My response to that gave him the idea of making an experiment in precocity. To aid in the massacre I had ear trouble—seven operations between the ages of nine and twelve. Of course this kept me apart from other boys and made me ripe for forcing. Anyway, while my generation was laboring through Uncle Remus I was honestly enjoying Catullus in the original.

“I passed off my college examinations when I was thirteen because I couldn't help it. My chief associates were professors, and I took a tremendous pride in knowing that I had a fine intelligence, for though I was unusually gifted I was not abnormal in other ways. When I was sixteen I got tired of being a freak; I decided that some one had made a bad mistake. Still as I'd gone that far I concluded to finish it up by taking my degree of Master of Arts. My chief interest in life is the study of modern philosophy. I am a realist of the School of Anton Laurier—with Bergsonian trimmings—and I'll be eighteen years old in two months. That's all.”

“Whew!” exclaimed Marcia. “That's enough! You do a neat job with the parts of speech.”

“Satisfied?”

“No, you haven't kissed me.”

“It's not in my programme,” demurred Horace. “Understand that I don't pretend to be above physical things. They have their place, but—”

“Oh, don't be so darned reasonable!”

“I can't help it.”

“I hate these slot-machine people.”

“I assure you I—”began Horace.

“Oh, shut up!”

“My own rationality—”

“I didn't say anything about your nationality. You're Amuricun, ar'n't you?”

“Yes.”

“Well, that's O.K. with me. I got a notion I want to see you do something that isn't in your highbrow programme. I want to see if a what-ch-call-em with Brazilian trimmings—that thing you said you were—can be a little human.”

Horace shook his head again.

“I won't kiss you.”

“My life is blighted,” muttered Marcia tragically. “I'm a beaten woman. I'll go through life without ever having a kiss with Brazilian trimmings.” She sighed. “Anyways, Omar, will you come and see my show?”

“What show?”

“I'm a wicked actress from ‘Home James’!”

“Light opera?”

“Yes—at a stretch. One of the characters is a Brazilian rice-planter. That might interest you.”

“I saw ‘The Bohemian Girl’ once,” reflected Horace aloud. “I enjoyed it—to some extent—”

“Then you'll come?”

“Well, I'm—I'm—”

“Oh, I know—you've got to run down to Brazil for the week-end.”

“Not at all. I'd be delighted to come—”

Marcia clapped her hands.

“Goodyforyou! I'll mail you a ticket—Thursday night?”

“Why, I—”

“Good! Thursday night it is.”

She stood up and walking close to him laid both hands on his shoulders.

“I like you, Omar. I'm sorry I tried to kid you. I thought you'd be sort of frozen, but you're a nice boy.”

He eyed her sardonically.

“I'm several thousand generations older than you are.”

“You carry your age well.”

They shook hands gravely.

“My name's Marcia Meadow,” she said emphatically. “'Member it—Marcia Meadow. And I won't tell Charlie Moon you were in.”

An instant later as she was skimming down the last flight of stairs three at a time she heard a voice call over the upper banister: “Oh, say—”

She stopped and looked up—made out a vague form leaning over.

“Oh, say!” called the prodigy again. “Can you hear me?”

“Here's your connection Omar.”

“I hope I haven't given you the impression that I consider kissing intrinsically irrational.”

“Impression? Why, you didn't even give me the kiss! Never fret—so long.”

Two doors near her opened curiously at the sound of a feminine voice. A tentative cough sounded from above. Gathering her skirts, Marcia dived wildly down the last flight, and was swallowed up in the murky Connecticut air outside.

Up-stairs Horace paced the floor of his study. From time to time he glanced toward Berkeley waiting there in suave dark-red reputability, an open book lying suggestively on his cushions. And then he found that his circuit of the floor was bringing him each time nearer to Hume. There was something about Hume that was strangely and inexpressibly different. The diaphanous form still seemed hovering near, and had Horace sat there he would have felt as if he were sitting on a lady's lap. And though Horace couldn't have named the quality of difference, there was such a quality—quite intangible to the speculative mind, but real, nevertheless. Hume was radiating something that in all the two hundred years of his influence he had never radiated before.

Hume was radiating attar of roses.





II


On Thursday night Horace Tarbox sat in an aisle seat in the fifth row and witnessed“Home James.” Oddly enough he found that he was enjoying himself. The cynical students near him were annoyed at his audible appreciation of time-honored jokes in the Hammerstein tradition. But Horace was waiting with anxiety for Marcia Meadow singing her song about a Jazz-bound Blundering Blimp. When she did appear, radiant under a floppity flower-faced hat, a warm glow settled over him, and when the song was over he did not join in the storm of applause. He felt somewhat numb.

In the intermission after the second act an usher materialized beside him, demanded to know if he were Mr. Tarbox, and then handed him a note written in a round adolescent band. Horace read it in some confusion, while the usher lingered with withering patience in the aisle.

“Dear Omar: After the show I always grow an awful hunger. If you want to satisfy it for me in the Taft Grill just communicate your answer to the big-timber guide that brought this and oblige.

Your friend,

Marcia Meadow.”

“Tell her,” —he coughed—“tell her that it will be quite all right. I'll meet her in front of the theatre.”

The big-timber guide smiled arrogantly.

“I giss she meant for you to come roun' t' the stage door.”

“Where—where is it?”

“Ou'side. Tunayulef. Down ee alley.”

“What?”

“Ou'side. Turn to y' left! Down ee alley!”

The arrogant person withdrew. A freshman behind Horace snickered.

Then half an hour later, sitting in the Taft Grill opposite the hair that was yellow by natural pigment, the prodigy was saying an odd thing.

“Do you have to do that dance in the last act?” he was asking earnestly—“I mean, would they dismiss you if you refused to do it?”

Marcia grinned.

“It's fun to do it. I like to do it.”

And then Horace came out with a faux pas.

“I should think you'd detest it,” he remarked succinctly. “The people behind me were making remarks about your bosom.”

Marcia blushed fiery red.

“I can't help that,” she said quickly. “The dance to me is only a sort of acrobatic stunt. Lord, it's hard enough to do! I rub liniment into my shoulders for an hour every night.”

“Do you have—fun while you're on the stage?”

“Uh-huh—sure! I got in the habit of having people look at me, Omar, and I like it.”

“Hm!” Horace sank into a brownish study.

“How's the Brazilian trimmings?”

“Hm!” repeated Horace, and then after a pause: “Where does the play go from here?”

“New York.”

“For how long?”

“All depends. Winter—maybe.”

“Oh!”

“Coming up to lay eyes on me, Omar, or aren't you int'rested? Not as nice here, is it, as it was up in your room? I wish we was there now.”

“I feel idiotic in this place,” confessed Horace, looking round him nervously.

“Too bad! We got along pretty well.”

At this he looked suddenly so melancholy that she changed her tone, and reaching over patted his hand.

“Ever take an actress out to supper before?”

“No,” said Horace miserably, “and I never will again. I don't know why I came to-night. Here under all these lights and with all these people laughing and chattering I feel completely out of my sphere. I don't know what to talk to you about.”

“We'll talk about me. We talked about you last time.”

“Very well.”

“Well, my name really is Meadow, but my first name isn't Marcia—it's Veronica. I'm nineteen. Question—how did the girl make her leap to the footlights? Answer—she was born in Passaic, New Jersey, and up to a year ago she got the right to breathe by pushing Nabiscoes in Marcel's tea-room in Trenton. She started going with a guy named Robbins, a singer in the Trent House cabaret, and he got her to try a song and dance with him one evening. In a month we were filling the supper-room every night. Then we went to New York with meet-my-friend letters thick as a pile of napkins.

“In two days we landed a job at Divinerries', and I learned to shimmy from a kid at the Palais Royal. We stayed at Divinerries' six months until one night Peter Boyce Wendell, the columnist, ate his milk-toast there. Next morning a poem about Marvellous Marcia came out in his newspaper, and within two days I had three vaudeville offers and a chance at the“Midnight Frolic”. I wrote Wendell a thank-you letter, and he printed it in his column—said that the style was like Carlyle's, only more rugged, and that I ought to quit dancing and do North American literature. This got me a coupla more vaudeville offers and a chance as an ingénue in a regular show. I took it—and here I am, Omar.”

When she finished they sat for a moment in silence, she draping the last skeins of a Welsh rabbit on her fork and waiting for him to speak.

“Let's get out of here,” he said suddenly.

Marcia's eyes hardened.

“What's the idea? Am I making you sick?”

“No, but I don't like it here. I don't like to be sitting here with you.”

Without another word Marcia signalled for the waiter.

“What's the check?” she demanded briskly. “My part—the rabbit and the ginger ale.”

Horace watched blankly as the waiter figured it.

“See here,” he began, “I intended to pay for yours too. You're my guest.”

With a half-sigh Marcia rose from the table and walked from the room. Horace, his face a document in bewilderment, laid a bill down and followed her out, up the stairs and into the lobby. He overtook her in front of the elevator and they faced each other.

“See here,” he repeated, “you're my guest. Have I said something to offend you?”

After an instant of wonder Marcia's eyes softened.

“You're a rude fella!” she said slowly. “Don't you know you're rude?”

“I can't help it,” said Horace with a directness she found quite disarming. “You know I like you.”

“You said you didn't like being with me.”

“I didn't like it.”

“Why not?”

Fire blazed suddenly from the gray forests of his eyes.

“Because I didn't. I've formed the habit of liking you. I've been thinking of nothing much else for two days.”

“Well, if you—”

“Wait a minute,” he interrupted. “I've got something to say. It's this: in six weeks I'll be eighteen years old. When I'm eighteen years old I'm coming up to New York to see you. Is there some place in New York where we can go and not have a lot of people in the room?”

“Sure!” smiled Marcia. “You can come up to my 'partment. Sleep on the couch if you want to.”

“I can't sleep on couches,” he said shortly. “But I want to talk to you.”

“Why, sure,” repeated Marcia—“in my 'partment.”

In his excitement Horace put his hands in his pockets.

“All right—just so I can see you alone. I want to talk to you as we talked up in my room.”

“Honey boy,” cried Marcia, laughing, “is it that you want to kiss me?”

“Yes,” Horace almost shouted. “I'll kiss you if you want me to.”

The elevator man was looking at them reproachfully. Marcia edged toward the grated door.

“I'll drop you a post-card,” she said.

Horace's eyes were quite wild.

“Send me a post-card! I'll come up any time after January first. I'll be eighteen then.”

And as she stepped into the elevator he coughed enigmatically, yet with a vague challenge, at the calling, and walked quickly away.





III


He was there again. She saw him when she took her first glance at the restless Manhattan audience—down in the front row with his head bent a bit forward and his gray eyes fixed on her. And she knew that to him they were alone together in a world where the high-rouged row of ballet faces and the massed whines of the violins were as imperceivable as powder on a marble Venus. An instinctive defiance rose within her.

“Silly boy!” she said to herself hurriedly, and she didn't take her encore.

“What do they expect for a hundred a week—perpetual motion?” she grumbled to herself in the wings.

“What's the trouble? Marcia?”

“Guy I don't like down in front.”

During the last act as she waited for her specialty she had an odd attack of stage fright. She had never sent Horace the promised post-card. Last night she had pretended not to see him—had hurried from the theatre immediately after her dance to pass a sleepless night in her apartment, thinking—as she had so often in the last month—of his pale, rather intent face, his slim, boyish figure, the merciless, unworldly abstraction that made him charming to her.

And now that he had come she felt vaguely sorry—as though an unwonted responsibility was being forced on her.

“Infant prodigy!” she said aloud.

“What?” demanded the negro comedian standing beside her.

“Nothing—just talking about myself.”

On the stage she felt better. This was her dance—and she always felt that the way she did it wasn't suggestive any more than to some men every pretty girl is suggestive. She made it a stunt.

“Uptown, downtown, jelly on a spoon,

After sundown shiver by the moon.”

He was not watching her now. She saw that clearly. He was looking very deliberately at a castle on the back drop, wearing that expression he had worn in the Taft Grill. A wave of exasperation swept over her—he was criticising her.

“That's the vibration that thr-ills me,

Funny how affection fi-lls me

Uptown, downtown—”

Unconquerable revulsion seized her. She was suddenly and horribly conscious of her audience as she had never been since her first appearance. Was that a leer on a pallid face in the front row, a droop of disgust on one young girl's mouth? These shoulders of hers—these shoulders shaking—were they hers? Were they real? Surely shoulders weren't made for this!

“Then—you'll see at a glance

“I'll need some funeral ushers with St. Vitus dance

At the end of the world I'll—”

The bassoon and two cellos crashed into a final chord. She paused and poised a moment on her toes with every muscle tense, her young face looking out dully at the audience in what one young girl afterward called“such a curious, puzzled look,” and then without bowing rushed from the stage. Into the dressing-room she sped, kicked out of one dress and into another, and caught a taxi outside.

Her apartment was very warm—small, it was, with a row of professional pictures and sets of Kipling and O. Henry which she had bought once from a blue-eyed agent and read occasionally. And there were several chairs which matched, but were none of them comfortable, and a pink-shaded lamp with blackbirds painted on it and an atmosphere of other stifled pink throughout. There were nice things in it—nice things unrelentingly hostile to each other, offspring of a vicarious, impatient taste acting in stray moments. The worst was typified by a great picture framed in oak bark of Passaic as seen from the Erie Railroad—altogether a frantic, oddly extravagant, oddly penurious attempt to make a cheerful room. Marcia knew it was a failure.

Into this room came the prodigy and took her two hands awkwardly.

“I followed you this time,” he said.

“Oh!”

“I want you to marry me,” he said.

Her arms went out to him. She kissed his mouth with a sort of passionate wholesomeness.

“There!”

“I love you,” he said.

She kissed him again and then with a little sigh flung herself into an armchair and half lay there, shaken with absurd laughter.

“Why, you infant prodigy!” she cried.

“Very well, call me that if you want to. I once told you that I was ten thousand years older than you—I am.”

She laughed again.

“I don't like to be disapproved of.”

“No one's ever going to disapprove of you again.”

“Omar,” she asked, “why do you want to marry me?”

The prodigy rose and put his hands in his pockets.

“Because I love you, Marcia Meadow.”

And then she stopped calling him Omar.

“Dear boy,” she said, “you know I sort of love you. There's something about you—I can't tell what—that just puts my heart through the wringer every time I'm round you. But honey—”She paused.

“But what?”

“But lots of things. But you're only just eighteen, and I'm nearly twenty.”

“Nonsense!” he interrupted. “Put it this way—that I'm in my nineteenth year and you're nineteen. That makes us pretty close—without counting that other ten thousand years I mentioned.”

Marcia laughed.

“But there are some more ‘buts.’ Your people—”

“My people!” exclaimed the prodigy ferociously. “My people tried to make a monstrosity out of me.” His face grew quite crimson at the enormity of what he was going to say. “My people can go way back and sit down!”

“My heavens!” cried Marcia in alarm. “All that? On tacks, I suppose.”

“Tacks—yes,” he agreed wildly—“on anything. The more I think of how they allowed me to become a little dried-up mummy—”

“What makes you think you're that?” asked Marcia quietly—“me?”

“Yes. Every person I've met on the streets since I met you has made me jealous because they knew what love was before I did. I used to call it the ‘sex impulse.’ Heavens!”

“There's more ‘buts,’” said Marcia

“What are they?”

“How could we live?”

“I'll make a living.”

“You're in college.”

“Do you think I care anything about taking a Master of Arts degree?”

“You want to be Master of Me, hey?”

“Yes! What? I mean, no!”

Marcia laughed, and crossing swiftly over sat in his lap. He put his arm round her wildly and implanted the vestige of a kiss somewhere near her neck.

“There's something white about you,” mused Marcia, “but it doesn't sound very logical.”

“Oh, don't be so darned reasonable!”

“I can't help it,” said Marcia.

“I hate these slot-machine people!”

“But we—”

“Oh, shut up!”

And as Marcia couldn't talk through her ears she had to.





IV


Horace and Marcia were married early in February. The sensation in academic circles both at Yale and Princeton was tremendous. Horace Tarbox, who at fourteen had been played up in the Sunday magazines sections of metropolitan newspapers, was throwing over his career, his chance of being a world authority on American philosophy, by marrying a chorus girl—they made Marcia a chorus girl. But like all modern stories it was a four-and-a-half-day wonder.

They took a flat in Harlem. After two weeks' search, during which his idea of the value of academic knowledge faded unmercifully, Horace took a position as clerk with a South American export company—some one had told him that exporting was the coming thing. Marcia was to stay in her show for a few months—anyway until he got on his feet. He was getting a hundred and twenty-five to start with, and though of course they told him it was only a question of months until he would be earning double that, Marcia refused even to consider giving up the hundred and fifty a week that she was getting at the time.

“We'll call ourselves Head and Shoulders, dear,” she said softly, “and the shoulders'll have to keep shaking a little longer until the old head gets started.”

“I hate it,” he objected gloomily.

“Well,” she replied emphatically, “your salary wouldn't keep us in a tenement. Don't think I want to be public—I don't. I want to be yours. But I'd be a half-wit to sit in one room and count the sun flowers on the wall-paper while I waited for you. When you pull down three hundred a month I'll quit.”

And much as it hurt his pride, Horace had to admit that hers was the wiser course.

March mellowed into April. May read a gorgeous riot act to the parks and waters of Manhatten, and they were very happy. Horace, who had no habits whatsoever—he had never had time to form any—proved the most adaptable of husbands, and as Marcia entirely lacked opinions on the subjects that engrossed him there were very few jottings and bumping. Their minds moved in different spheres. Marcia acted as practical factotum, and Horace lived either in his old world of abstract ideas or in a sort of triumphantly earthy worship and adoration of his wife. She was a continual source of astonishment to him—the freshness and originality of her mind, her dynamic, clear-headed energy, and her unfailing good humor.

And Marcia's co-workers in the nine-o'clock show, whither she had transferred her talents, were impressed with her tremendous pride in her husband's mental powers. Horace they knew only as a very slim, tight-lipped, and immature-looking young man, who waited every night to take her home.

“Horace,” said Marcia one evening when she met him as usual at eleven, “you looked like a ghost standing there against the street lights. You losing weight?”

He shook his head vaguely.

“I don't know. They raised me to a hundred and thirty-five dollars to-day, and—”

“I don't care,” said Marcia severely. “You're killing yourself working at night. You read those big books on economy—”

“Economics,” corrected Horace.

“Well, you read 'em every night long after I'm asleep. And you're getting all stooped over like you were before we were married.”

“But, Marcia, I've got to—”

“No, you haven't dear. I guess I'm running this shop for the present, and I won't let my fella ruin his health and eyes. You got to get some exercise.”

“I do. Every morning I—”

“Oh, I know! But those dumb-bells of yours wouldn't give a consumptive two degrees of fever. I mean real exercise. You've got to join a gymnasium. 'Member you told me you were such a trick gymnast once that they tried to get you out for the team in college and they couldn't because you had a standing date with Herb Spencer?”

“I used to enjoy it,” mused Horace, “but it would take up too much time now.”

“All right,” said Marcia. “I'll make a bargain with you. You join a gym and I'll read one of those books from the brown row of 'em.”

“‘Pepys' Diary’? Why, that ought to be enjoyable. He's very light.”

“Not for me—he isn't. It'll be like digesting plate glass. But you been telling me how much it'd broaden my lookout. Well, you go to a gym three nights a week and I'll take one big dose of Sammy.”

Horace hesitated.

“Well—”

“Come on, now! You do some giant swings for me and I'll chase some culture for you.”

So Horace finally consented, and all through a baking summer he spent three and sometimes four evenings a week experimenting on the trapeze in Skipper's Gymnasium. And in August he admitted to Marcia that it made him capable of more mental work during the day.

“Mens sana in corpore sano,” he said.

“Don't believe in it,” replied Marcia. “I tried one of those patent medicines once and they're all bunk. You stick to gymnastics.”

One night in early September while he was going through one of his contortions on the rings in the nearly deserted room he was addressed by a meditative fat man whom he had noticed watching him for several nights.

“Say, lad, do that stunt you were doin' last night.”

Horace grinned at him from his perch.

“I invented it,” he said. “I got the idea from the fourth proposition of Euclid.”

“What circus he with?”

“He's dead.”

“Well, he must of broke his neck doin' that stunt. I set here last night thinkin' sure you was goin' to break yours.”

“Like this!” said Horace, and swinging onto the trapeze he did his stunt.

“Don't it kill your neck an' shoulder muscles?”

“It did at first, but inside of a week I wrote the quod erat demonstrandum on it.”

“Hm!”

Horace swung idly on the trapeze.

“Ever think of takin' it up professionally?” asked the fat man.

“Not I.”

“Good money in it if you're willin' to do stunts like 'at an' can get away with it.”

“Here's another,” chirped Horace eagerly, and the fat man's mouth dropped suddenly agape as he watched this pink-jerseyed Prometheus again defy the gods and Isaac Newton.

The night following this encounter Horace got home from work to find a rather pale Marcia stretched out on the sofa waiting for him.

“I fainted twice to-day,” she began without preliminaries.

“What?”

“Yep. You see baby's due in four months now. Doctor says I ought to have quit dancing two weeks ago.”

Horace sat down and thought it over.

“I'm glad of course,” he said pensively—“I mean glad that we're going to have a baby. But this means a lot of expense.”

“I've got two hundred and fifty in the bank,” said Marcia hopefully, “and two weeks' pay coming.”

Horace computed quickly.

“Inducing my salary, that'll give us nearly fourteen hundred for the next six months.”

Marcia looked blue.

“That all? Course I can get a job singing somewhere this month. And I can go to work again in March.”

“Of course nothing!” said Horace gruffly. “You'll stay right here. Let's see now—there'll be doctor's bills and a nurse, besides the maid. We've got to have some more money.”

“Well,” said Marcia wearily, “I don't know where it's coming from. It's up to the old head now. Shoulders is out of business.”

Horace rose and pulled on his coat.

“Where are you going?”

“I've got an idea,” he answered. “I'll be right back.”

Ten minutes later as he headed down the street toward Skipper's Gymnasium he felt a placid wonder, quite unmixed with humor, at what he was going to do. How he would have gaped at himself a year before! How every one would have gaped! But when you opened your door at the rap of life you let in many things.

The gymnasium was brightly lit, and when his eyes became accustomed to the glare he found the meditative fat man seated on a pile of canvas mats smoking a big cigar.

“Say,” began Horace directly, “were you in earnest last night when you said I could make money on my trapeze stunts?”

“Why, yes,” said the fat man in surprise.

“Well, I've been thinking it over, and I believe I'd like to try it. I could work at night and on Saturday afternoons—and regularly if the pay is high enough.”

The fat men looked at his watch.

“Well,” he said, “Charlie Paulson's the man to see. He'll book you inside of four days, once he sees you work out. He won't be in now, but I'll get hold of him for to-morrow night.”

The fat man was as good as his word. Charlie Paulson arrived next night and put in a wondrous hour watching the prodigy swap through the air in amazing parabolas, and on the night following he brought two large men with him who looked as though they had been born smoking black cigars and talking about money in low, passionate voices. Then on the succeeding Saturday Horace Tarbox's torso made its first professional appearance in a gymnastic exhibition at the Coleman Street Gardens. But though the audience numbered nearly five thousand people, Horace felt no nervousness. From his childhood he had read papers to audiences—learned that trick of detaching himself.

“Marcia,” he said cheerfully later that same night, “I think we're out of the woods. Paulson thinks he can get me an opening at the Hippodrome, and that means an all-winter engagement. The Hippodrome you know, is a big—”

“Yes, I believe I've heard of it,” interrupted Marcia, “but I want to know about this stunt you're doing. It isn't any spectacular suicide, is it?”

“It's nothing,” said Horace quietly. “But if you can think of an nicer way of a man killing himself than taking a risk for you, why that's the way I want to die.”

Marcia reached up and wound both arms tightly round his neck.

“Kiss me,” she whispered, “and call me ‘dear heart.’ I love to hear you say ‘dear heart.’ And bring me a book to read to-morrow. No more Sam Pepys, but something trick and trashy. I've been wild for something to do all day. I felt like writing letters, but I didn't have anybody to write to.”

“Write to me,” said Horace. “I'll read them.”

“I wish I could,” breathed Marcia. “If I knew words enough I could write you the longest love-letter in the world—and never get tired.”

But after two more months Marcia grew very tired indeed, and for a row of nights it was a very anxious, weary-looking young athlete who walked out before the Hippodrome crowd. Then there were two days when his place was taken by a young man who wore pale blue instead of white, and got very little applause. But after the two days Horace appeared again, and those who sat close to the stage remarked an expression of beatific happiness on that young acrobat's face, even when he was twisting breathlessly in the air an the middle of his amazing and original shoulder swing. After that performance he laughed at the elevator man and dashed up the stairs to the flat five steps at a time—and then tiptoed very carefully into a quiet room.

“Marcia,” he whispered.

“Hello!” She smiled up at him wanly. “Horace, there's something I want you to do. Look in my top bureau drawer and you'll find a big stack of paper. It's a book—sort of—Horace. I wrote it down in these last three months while I've been laid up. I wish you'd take it to that Peter Boyce Wendell who put my letter in his paper. He could tell you whether it'd be a good book. I wrote it just the way I talk, just the way I wrote that letter to him. It's just a story about a lot of things that happened to me. Will you take it to him, Horace?”

“Yes, darling.”

He leaned over the bed until his head was beside her on the pillow, and began stroking back her yellow hair.

“Dearest Marcia,” he said softly.

“No,” she murmured, “call me what I told you to call me.”

“Dear heart,” he whispered passionately—“dearest heart.”

“What'll we call her?”

They rested a minute in happy, drowsy content, while Horace considered.

“We'll call her Marcia Hume Tarbox,” he said at length.

“Why the Hume?”

“Because he's the fellow who first introduced us.”

“That so?” she murmured, sleepily surprised. “I thought his name was Moon.”

Her eyes dosed, and after a moment the slow, lengthening surge of the bedclothes over her breast showed that she was asleep.

Horace tiptoed over to the bureau and opening the top drawer found a heap of closely scrawled, lead-smeared pages. He looked at the first sheet:

SANDRA PEPYS, SYNCOPATED

BY MARCIA TARBOX

He smiled. So Samuel Pepys had made an impression on her after all. He turned a page and began to read. His smile deepened—he read on. Half an hour passed and he became aware that Marcia had waked and was watching him from the bed.

“Honey,” came in a whisper.

“What Marcia?”

“Do you like it?”

Horace coughed.

“I seem to be reading on. It's bright.”

“Take it to Peter Boyce Wendell. Tell him you got the highest marks in Princeton once and that you ought to know when a book's good. Tell him this one's a world beater.”

“All right, Marcia,” Horace said gently.

Her eyes closed again and Horace crossing over kissed her forehead—stood there for a moment with a look of tender pity. Then he left the room.

All that night the sprawly writing on the pages, the constant mistakes in spelling and grammar, and the weird punctuation danced before his eyes. He woke several times in the night, each time full of a welling chaotic sympathy for this desire of Marcia's soul to express itself in words. To him there was something infinitely pathetic about it, and for the first time in months he began to turn over in his mind his own half-forgotten dreams.

He had meant to write a series of books, to popularize the new realism as Schopenhauer had popularized pessimism and William James pragmatism.

But life hadn't come that way. Life took hold of people and forced them into flying rings. He laughed to think of that rap at his door, the diaphanous shadow in Hume, Marcia's threatened kiss.

“And it's still me,” he said aloud in wonder as he lay awake in the darkness. “I'm the man who sat in Berkeley with temerity to wonder if that rap would have had actual existence had my ear not been there to hear it. I'm still that man. I could be electrocuted for the crimes he committed.

“Poor gauzy souls trying to express ourselves in something tangible. Marcia with her written book; I with my unwritten ones. Trying to choose our mediums and then taking what we get—and being glad.”





V


“Sandra Pepys, Syncopated,” with an introduction by Peter Boyce Wendell the columnist, appeared serially in Jordan's Magazine, and came out in book form in March. From its first published instalment it attracted attention far and wide. A trite enough subject—a girl from a small New Jersey town coming to New York to go on the stage—treated simply, with a peculiar vividness of phrasing and a haunting undertone of sadness in the very inadequacy of its vocabulary, it made an irresistible appeal.

Peter Boyce Wendell, who happened at that time to be advocating the enrichment of the American language by the immediate adoption of expressive vernacular words, stood as its sponsor and thundered his indorsement over the placid bromides of the conventional reviewers.

Marcia received three hundred dollars an instalment for the serial publication, which came at an opportune time, for though Horace's monthly salary at the Hippodrome was now more than Marcia's had ever been, young Marcia was emitting shrill cries which they interpreted as a demand for country air. So early April found them installed in a bungalow in Westchester County, with a place for a lawn, a place for a garage, and a place for everything, including a sound-proof impregnable study, in which Marcia faithfully promised Mr. Jordan she would shut herself up when her daughter's demands began to be abated, and compose immortally illiterate literature.

“It's not half bad,” thought Horace one night as he was on his way from the station to his house. He was considering several prospects that had opened up, a four months' vaudeville offer in five figures, a chance to go back to Princeton in charge of all gymnasium work. Odd! He had once intended to go back there in charge of all philosophic work, and now he had not even been stirred by the arrival in New York of Anton Laurier, his old idol.

The gravel crunched raucously under his heel. He saw the lights of his sitting-room gleaming and noticed a big car standing in the drive. Probably Mr. Jordan again, come to persuade Marcia to settle down to work.

She had heard the sound of his approach and her form was silhouetted against the lighted door as she came out to meet him.

“There's some Frenchman here,” she whispered nervously. “I can't pronounce his name, but he sounds awful deep. You'll have to jaw with him.”

“What Frenchman?”

“You can't prove it by me. He drove up an hour ago with Mr. Jordan, and said he wanted to meet Sandra Pepys, and all that sort of thing.”

Two men rose from chairs as they went inside.

“Hello Tarbox,” said Jordan. “I've just been bringing together two celebrities. I've brought M'sieur Laurier out with me. M'sieur Laurier, let me present Mr. Tarbox, Mrs. Tarbox's husband.”

“Not Anton Laurier!” exclaimed Horace.

“But, yes. I must come. I have to come. I have read the book of Madame, and I have been charmed”—he fumbled in his pocket—“ah I have read of you too. In this newspaper which I read to-day it has your name.”

He finally produced a clipping from a magazine.

“Read it!” he said eagerly. “It has about you too.”

Horace's eye skipped down the page.

“A distinct contribution to American dialect literature,” it said. “No attempt at literary tone; the book derives its very quality from this fact, as did ‘Huckleberry Finn.’”

Horace's eyes caught a passage lower down; he became suddenly aghast—read on hurriedly:

“Marcia Tarbox's connection with the stage is not only as a spectator but as the wife of a performer. She was married last year to Horace Tarbox, who every evening delights the children at the Hippodrome with his wondrous flying performance. It is said that the young couple have dubbed themselves Head and Shoulders, referring doubtless to the fact that Mrs. Tarbox supplies the literary and mental qualities, while the supple and agile shoulder of her husband contribute their share to the family fortunes.

“Mrs. Tarbox seems to merit that much-abused title— ‘prodigy.’ Only twenty—”

Horace stopped reading, and with a very odd expression in his eyes gazed intently at Anton Laurier.

“I want to advise you—”he began hoarsely.

“What?”

“About raps. Don't answer them! Let them alone—have a padded door.”





BERNICE BOBS HER HAIR


I


After dark on Saturday night one could stand on the first tee of the golf-course and see the country-club windows as a yellow expanse over a very black and wavy ocean. The waves of this ocean, so to speak, were the heads of many curious caddies, a few of the more ingenious chauffeurs, the golf professional's deaf sister—and there were usually several stray, diffident waves who might have rolled inside had they so desired. This was the gallery.

The balcony was inside. It consisted of the circle of wicker chairs that lined the wall of the combination clubroom and ballroom. At these Saturday-night dances it was largely feminine; a great babel of middle-aged ladies with sharp eyes and icy hearts behind lorgnettes and large bosoms. The main function of the balcony was critical. It occasionally showed grudging admiration, but never approval, for it is well known among ladies over thirty-five that when the younger set dance in the summer-time it is with the very worst intentions in the world, and if they are not bombarded with stony eyes stray couples will dance weird barbaric interludes in the corners, and the more popular, more dangerous, girls will sometimes be kissed in the parked limousines of unsuspecting dowagers.

But, after all, this critical circle is not close enough to the stage to see the actors' faces and catch the subtler byplay. It can only frown and lean, ask questions and make satisfactory deductions from its set of postulates, such as the one which states that every young man with a large income leads the life of a hunted partridge. It never really appreciates the drama of the shifting, semi-cruel world of adolescence. No; boxes, orchestra-circle, principals, and chorus are represented by the medley of faces and voices that sway to the plaintive African rhythm of Dyer's dance orchestra.

From sixteen-year-old Otis Ormonde, who has two more years at Hill School, to G. Reece Stoddard, over whose bureau at home hangs a Harvard law diploma; from little Madeleine Hogue, whose hair still feels strange and uncomfortable on top of her head, to Bessie MacRae, who has been the life of the party a little too long—more than ten years—the medley is not only the centre of the stage but contains the only people capable of getting an unobstructed view of it.

With a flourish and a bang the music stops. The couples exchange artificial, effortless smiles, facetiously repeat“la-de-da-da dum-dum,” and then the clatter of young feminine voices soars over the burst of clapping.

A few disappointed stags caught in midfloor as they bad been about to cut in subsided listlessly back to the walls, because this was not like the riotous Christmas dances—these summer hops were considered just pleasantly warm and exciting, where even the younger marrieds rose and performed ancient waltzes and terrifying fox trots to the tolerant amusement of their younger brothers and sisters.

Warren McIntyre, who casually attended Yale, being one of the unfortunate stags, felt in his dinner-coat pocket for a cigarette and strolled out onto the wide, semidark veranda, where couples were scattered at tables, filling the lantern-hung night with vague words and hazy laughter. He nodded here and there at the less absorbed and as he passed each couple some half-forgotten fragment of a story played in his mind, for it was not a large city and every one was Who's Who to every one else's past. There, for example, were Jim Strain and Ethel Demorest, who had been privately engaged for three years. Every one knew that as soon as Jim managed to hold a job for more than two months she would marry him. Yet how bored they both looked, and how wearily Ethel regarded Jim sometimes, as if she wondered why she had trained the vines of her affection on such a wind-shaken poplar.

Warren was nineteen and rather pitying with those of his friends who hadn't gone East to college. But, like most boys, he bragged tremendously about the girls of his city when he was away from it. There was Genevieve Ormonde, who regularly made the rounds of dances, house-parties, and football games at Princeton, Yale, Williams, and Cornell; there was black-eyed Roberta Dillon, who was quite as famous to her own generation as Hiram Johnson or Ty Cobb; and, of course, there was Marjorie Harvey, who besides having a fairylike face and a dazzling, bewildering tongue was already justly celebrated for having turned five cart-wheels in succession during the last pump-and-slipper dance at New Haven.

Warren, who had grown up across the street from Marjorie, had long been“crazy about her.” Sometimes she seemed to reciprocate his feeling with a faint gratitude, but she had tried him by her infallible test and informed him gravely that she did not love him. Her test was that when she was away from him she forgot him and had affairs with other boys. Warren found this discouraging, especially as Marjorie had been making little trips all summer, and for the first two or three days after each arrival home he saw great heaps of mail on the Harveys' hall table addressed to her in various masculine handwritings. To make matters worse, all during the month of August she had been visited by her cousin Bernice from Eau Claire, and it seemed impossible to see her alone. It was always necessary to hunt round and find some one to take care of Bernice. As August waned this was becoming more and more difficult.

Much as Warren worshipped Marjorie he had to admit that Cousin Bernice was sorta dopeless. She was pretty, with dark hair and high color, but she was no fun on a party. Every Saturday night he danced a long arduous duty dance with her to please Marjorie, but he had never been anything but bored in her company.

“Warren”—a soft voice at his elbow broke in upon his thoughts, and he turned to see Marjorie, flushed and radiant as usual. She laid a hand on his shoulder and a glow settled almost imperceptibly over him.

“Warren,” she whispered, “do something for me—dance with Bernice. She's been stuck with little Otis Ormonde for almost an hour.”

Warren's glow faded.

“Why—sure,” he answered half-heartedly.

“You don't mind, do you? I'll see that you don't get stuck.”

“'Sall right.”

Marjorie smiled—that smile that was thanks enough.

“You're an angel, and I'm obliged loads.”

With a sigh the angel glanced round the veranda, but Bernice and Otis were not in sight. He wandered back inside, and there in front of the women's dressing-room he found Otis in the centre of a group of young men who were convulsed with laughter. Otis was brandishing a piece of timber he had picked up, and discoursing volubly.

“She's gone in to fix her hair,” he announced wildly. “I'm waiting to dance another hour with her.”

Their laughter was renewed.

“Why don't some of you cut in?” cried Otis resentfully. “She likes more variety.”

“Why, Otis,” suggested a friend, “you've just barely got used to her.”

“Why the two-by-four, Otis?” inquired Warren, smiling.

“The two-by-four? Oh, this? This is a club. When she comes out I'll hit her on the head and knock her in again.”

Warren collapsed on a settee and howled with glee.

“Never mind, Otis,” he articulated finally. “I'm relieving you this time.”

Otis simulated a sudden fainting attack and handed the stick to Warren.

“If you need it, old man,” he said hoarsely.

No matter how beautiful or brilliant a girl may be, the reputation of not being frequently cut in on makes her position at a dance unfortunate. Perhaps boys prefer her company to that of the butte flies with whom they dance a dozen times an evening but, youth in this jazz-nourished generation is temperamentally restless, and the idea of fox-trotting more than one full fox trot with the same girl is distasteful, not to say odious. When it comes to several dances and the intermissions between she can be quite sure that a young man, once relieved, will never tread on her wayward toes again.

Warren danced the next full dance with Bernice, and finally, thankful for the intermission, he led her to a table on the veranda. There was a moment's silence while she did unimpressive things with her fan.

“It's hotter here than in Eau Claire,” she said.

Warren stifled a sigh and nodded. It might be for all he knew or cared. He wondered idly whether she was a poor conversationalist because she got no attention or got no attention because she was a poor conversationalist.

“You going to be here much longer?” he asked and then turned rather red. She might suspect his reasons for asking.

“Another week,” she answered, and stared at him as if to lunge at his next remark when it left his lips.

Warren fidgeted. Then with a sudden charitable impulse he decided to try part of his line on her. He turned and looked at her eyes.

“You've got an awfully kissable mouth,” he began quietly.

This was a remark that he sometimes made to girls at college proms when they were talking in just such half dark as this. Bernice distinctly jumped. She turned an ungraceful red and became clumsy with her fan. No one had ever made such a remark to her before.

“Fresh!” —the word had slipped out before she realized it, and she bit her lip. Too late she decided to be amused, and offered him a flustered smile.

Warren was annoyed. Though not accustomed to have that remark taken seriously, still it usually provoked a laugh or a paragraph of sentimental banter. And he hated to be called fresh, except in a joking way. His charitable impulse died and he switched the topic.

“Jim Strain and Ethel Demorest sitting out as usual,” he commented.

This was more in Bernice's line, but a faint regret mingled with her relief as the subject changed. Men did not talk to her about kissable mouths, but she knew that they talked in some such way to other girls.

“Oh, yes,” she said, and laughed. “I hear they've been mooning around for years without a red penny. Isn't it silly?”

Warren's disgust increased. Jim Strain was a close friend of his brother's, and anyway he considered it bad form to sneer at people for not having money. But Bernice had had no intention of sneering. She was merely nervous.





II


When Marjorie and Bernice reached home at half after midnight they said good night at the top of the stairs. Though cousins, they were not intimates. As a matter of fact Marjorie had no female intimates—she considered girls stupid. Bernice on the contrary all through this parent-arranged visit had rather longed to exchange those confidences flavored with giggles and tears that she considered an indispensable factor in all feminine intercourse. But in this respect she found Marjorie rather cold; felt somehow the same difficulty in talking to her that she had in talking to men. Marjorie never giggled, was never frightened, seldom embarrassed, and in fact had very few of the qualities which Bernice considered appropriately and blessedly feminine.

As Bernice busied herself with tooth-brush and paste this night she wondered for the hundredth time why she never had any attention when she was away from home. That her family were the wealthiest in Eau Claire; that her mother entertained tremendously, gave little diners for her daughter before all dances and bought her a car of her own to drive round in, never occurred to her as factors in her home-town social success. Like most girls she had been brought up on the warm milk prepared by Annie Fellows Johnston and on novels in which the female was beloved because of certain mysterious womanly qualities always mentioned but never displayed.

Bernice felt a vague pain that she was not at present engaged in being popular. She did not know that had it not been for Marjorie's campaigning she would have danced the entire evening with one man; but she knew that even in Eau Claire other girls with less position and less pulchritude were given a much bigger rush. She attributed this to something subtly unscrupulous in those girls. It had never worried her, and if it had her mother would have assured her that the other girls cheapened themselves and that men really respected girls like Bernice.

She turned out the light in her bathroom, and on an impulse decided to go in and chat for a moment with her aunt Josephine, whose light was still on. Her soft slippers bore her noiselessly down the carpeted hall, but hearing voices inside she stopped near the partly openers door. Then she caught her own name, and without any definite intention of eavesdropping lingered—and the thread of the conversation going on inside pierced her consciousness sharply as if it had been drawn through with a needle.

“She's absolutely hopeless!” It was Marjorie's voice. “Oh, I know what you're going to say! So many people have told you how pretty and sweet she is, and how she can cook! What of it? She has a bum time. Men don't like her.”

“What's a little cheap popularity?”

Mrs. Harvey sounded annoyed.

“It's everything when you're eighteen,” said Marjorie emphatically. “I've done my best. I've been polite and I've made men dance with her, but they just won't stand being bored. When I think of that gorgeous coloring wasted on such a ninny, and think what Martha Carey could do with it—oh!”

“There's no courtesy these days.”

Mrs. Harvey's voice implied that modern situations were too much for her. When she was a girl all young ladies who belonged to nice families had glorious times.

“Well,” said Marjorie, “no girl can permanently bolster up a lame-duck visitor, because these days it's every girl for herself. I've even tried to drop hints about clothes and things, and she's been furious—given me the funniest looks. She's sensitive enough to know she's not getting away with much, but I'll bet she consoles herself by thinking that she's very virtuous and that I'm too gay and fickle and will come to a bad end. All unpopular girls think that way. Sour grapes! Sarah Hopkins refers to Genevieve and Roberta and me as gardenia girls! I'll bet she'd give ten years of her life and her European education to be a gardenia girl and have three or four men in love with her and be cut in on every few feet at dances.”

“It seems to me,” interrupted Mrs. Harvey rather wearily, “that you ought to be able to do something for Bernice. I know she's not very vivacious.”

Marjorie groaned.

“Vivacious! Good grief! I've never heard her say anything to a boy except that it's hot or the floor's crowded or that she's going to school in New York next year. Sometimes she asks them what kind of car they have and tells them the kind she has. Thrilling!”

There was a short silence and then Mrs. Harvey took up her refrain:

“All I know is that other girls not half so sweet and attractive get partners. Martha Carey, for instance, is stout and loud, and her mother is distinctly common. Roberta Dillon is so thin this year that she looks as though Arizona were the place for her. She's dancing herself to death.”

“But, mother,” objected Marjorie impatiently, “Martha is cheerful and awfully witty and an awfully slick girl, and Roberta's a marvellous dancer. She's been popular for ages!”

Mrs. Harvey yawned.

“I think it's that crazy Indian blood in Bernice,” continued Marjorie. “Maybe she's a reversion to type. Indian women all just sat round and never said anything.”

“Go to bed, you silly child,” laughed Mrs. Harvey. “I wouldn't have told you that if I'd thought you were going to remember it. And I think most of your ideas are perfectly idiotic,” she finished sleepily.

There was another silence, while Marjorie considered whether or not convincing her mother was worth the trouble. People over forty can seldom be permanently convinced of anything. At eighteen our convictions are hills from which we look; at forty-five they are caves in which we hide.

Having decided this, Marjorie said good night. When she came out into the hall it was quite empty.

While Marjorie was breakfasting late next day Bernice came into the room with a rather formal good morning, sat down opposite, stared intently over and slightly moistened her lips.

“What's on your mind?” inquired Marjorie, rather puzzled.

Bernice paused before she threw her hand-grenade.

“I heard what you said about me to your mother last night.”

Marjorie was startled, but she showed only a faintly heightened color and her voice was quite even when she spoke.

“Where were you?”

“In the hall. I didn't mean to listen—at first.”

After an involuntary look of contempt Marjorie dropped her eyes and became very interested in balancing a stray corn-flake on her finger.”

“I guess I'd better go back to Eau Claire—if I'm such a nuisance.” Bernice's lower lip was trembling violently and she continued on a wavering note: “I've tried to be nice, and—and I've been first neglected and then insulted. No one ever visited me and got such treatment.”

Marjorie was silent.

“But I'm in the way, I see. I'm a drag on you. Your friends don't like me.” She paused, and then remembered another one of her grievances. “Of course I was furious last week when you tried to hint to me that that dress was unbecoming. Don't you think I know how to dress myself?”

“No,” murmured less than half-aloud.

“What?”

“I didn't hint anything,” said Marjorie succinctly. “I said, as I remember, that it was better to wear a becoming dress three times straight than to alternate it with two frights.”

“Do you think that was a very nice thing to say?”

“I wasn't trying to be nice.” Then after a pause: “When do you want to go?”

Bernice drew in her breath sharply.

“Oh!” It was a little half-cry.

Marjorie looked up in surprise.

“Didn't you say you were going?”

“Yes, but—”

“Oh, you were only bluffing!”

They stared at each other across the breakfast-table for a moment. Misty waves were passing before Bernice's eyes, while Marjorie's face wore that rather hard expression that she used when slightly intoxicated undergraduate's were making love to her.

“So you were bluffing,” she repeated as if it were what she might have expected.

Bernice admitted it by bursting into tears. Marjorie's eyes showed boredom.

“You're my cousin,” sobbed Bernice. “I'm v-v-visiting you. I was to stay a month, and if I go home my mother will know and she'll wah-wonder—”

Marjorie waited until the shower of broken words collapsed into little sniffles.

“I'll give you my month's allowance,” she said coldly, “and you can spend this last week anywhere you want. There's a very nice hotel—”

Bernice's sobs rose to a flute note, and rising of a sudden she fled from the room.

An hour later, while Marjorie was in the library absorbed in composing one of those non-committal marvelously elusive letters that only a young girl can write, Bernice reappeared, very red-eyed, and consciously calm. She cast no glance at Marjorie but took a book at random from the shelf and sat down as if to read. Marjorie seemed absorbed in her letter and continued writing. When the clock showed noon Bernice closed her book with a snap.

“I suppose I'd better get my railroad ticket.”

This was not the beginning of the speech she had rehearsed up-stairs, but as Marjorie was not getting her cues—wasn't urging her to be reasonable; it's an a mistake—it was the best opening she could muster.

“Just wait till I finish this letter,” said Marjorie without looking round. “I want to get it off in the next mail.”

After another minute, during which her pen scratched busily, she turned round and relaxed with an air of“at your service.” Again Bernice had to speak.

“Do you want me to go home?”

“Well,” said Marjorie, considering, “I suppose if you're not having a good time you'd better go. No use being miserable.”

“Don't you think common kindness—”

“Oh, please don't quote ‘Little Women’!” cried Marjorie impatiently. “That's out of style.”

“You think so?”

“Heavens, yes! What modern girl could live like those inane females?”

“They were the models for our mothers.”

Marjorie laughed.

“Yes, they were—not! Besides, our mothers were all very well in their way, but they know very little about their daughters' problems.”

Bernice drew herself up.

“Please don't talk about my mother.”

Marjorie laughed.

“I don't think I mentioned her.”

Bernice felt that she was being led away from her subject.

“Do you think you've treated me very well?”

“I've done my best. You're rather hard material to work with.”

The lids of Bernice's eyes reddened.

“I think you're hard and selfish, and you haven't a feminine quality in you.”

“Oh, my Lord!” cried Marjorie in desperation. “You little nut! Girls like you are responsible for all the tiresome colorless marriages; all those ghastly inefficiencies that pass as feminine qualities. What a blow it must be when a man with imagination marries the beautiful bundle of clothes that he's been building ideals round, and finds that she's just a weak, whining, cowardly mass of affectations!”

Bernice's mouth had slipped half open.

“The womanly woman!” continued Marjorie. “Her whole early life is occupied in whining criticisms of girls like me who really do have a good time.”

Bernice's jaw descended farther as Marjorie's voice rose.

“There's some excuse for an ugly girl whining. If I'd been irretrievably ugly I'd never have forgiven my parents for bringing me into the world. But you're starting life without any handicap—”Marjorie's little fist clinched. “If you expect me to weep with you you'll be disappointed. Go or stay, just as you like.” And picking up her letters she left the room.

Bernice claimed a headache and failed to appear at luncheon. They had a matinée date for the afternoon, but the headache persisting, Marjorie made explanation to a not very downcast boy. But when she returned late in the afternoon she found Bernice with a strangely set face waiting for her in her bedroom.

“I've decided,” began Bernice without preliminaries, “that maybe you're right about things—possibly not. But if you'll tell me why your friends aren't—aren't interested in me I'll see if I can do what you want me to.”

Marjorie was at the mirror shaking down her hair.

“Do you mean it?”

“Yes.”

“Without reservations? Will you do exactly what I say?”

“Well, I—”

“Well nothing! Will you do exactly as I say?”

“If they're sensible things.”

“They're not! You're no case for sensible things.”

“Are you going to make—to recommend—”

“Yes, everything. If I tell you to take boxing-lessons you'll have to do it. Write home and tell your mother you're going to stay another two weeks.”

“If you'll tell me—”

“All right—I'll just give you a few examples now. First you have no ease of manner. Why? Because you're never sure about your personal appearance. When a girl feels that she's perfectly groomed and dressed she can forget that part of her. That's charm. The more parts of yourself you can afford to forget the more charm you have.”

“Don't I look all right?”

“No; for instance you never take care of your eyebrows. They're black and lustrous, but by leaving them straggly they're a blemish. They'd be beautiful if you'd take care of them in one-tenth the time you take doing nothing. You're going to brush them so that they'll grow straight.”

Bernice raised the brows in question.

“Do you mean to say that men notice eyebrows?”

“Yes—subconsciously. And when you go home you ought to have your teeth straightened a little. It's almost imperceptible, still—”

“But I thought,” interrupted Bernice in bewilderment, “that you despised little dainty feminine things like that.”

“I hate dainty minds,” answered Marjorie. “But a girl has to be dainty in person. If she looks like a million dollars she can talk about Russia, ping-pong, or the League of Nations and get away with it.”

“What else?”

“Oh, I'm just beginning! There's your dancing.”

“Don't I dance all right?”

“No, you don't—you lean on a man; yes, you do—ever so slightly. I noticed it when we were dancing together yesterday. And you dance standing up straight instead of bending over a little. Probably some old lady on the side-line once told you that you looked so dignified that way. But except with a very small girl it's much harder on the man, and he's the one that counts.”

“Go on.” Bernice's brain was reeling.

“Well, you've got to learn to be nice to men who are sad birds. You look as if you'd been insulted whenever you're thrown with any except the most popular boys. Why, Bernice, I'm cut in on every few feet—and who does most of it? Why, those very sad birds. No girl can afford to neglect them. They're the big part of any crowd. Young boys too shy to talk are the very best conversational practice. Clumsy boys are the best dancing practice. If you can follow them and yet look graceful you can follow a baby tank across a barb-wire sky-scraper.”

Bernice sighed profoundly, but Marjorie was not through.

“If you go to a dance and really amuse, say, three sad birds that dance with you; if you talk so well to them that they forget they're stuck with you, you've done something. They'll come back next time, and gradually so many sad birds will dance with you that the attractive boys will see there's no danger of being stuck—then they'll dance with you.”

“Yes,” agreed Bernice faintly. “I think I begin to see.”

“And finally,” concluded Marjorie, “poise and charm will just come. You'll wake up some morning knowing you've attained it and men will know it too.”

Bernice rose.

“It's been awfully kind of you—but nobody's ever talked to me like this before, and I feel sort of startled.”

Marjorie made no answer but gazed pensively at her own image in the mirror.

“You're a peach to help me,” continued Bernice.

Still Marjorie did not answer, and Bernice thought she had seemed too grateful.

“I know you don't like sentiment,” she said timidly.

Marjorie turned to her quickly.

“Oh, I wasn't thinking about that. I was considering whether we hadn't better bob your hair.”

Bernice collapsed backward upon the bed.





IV


On the following Wednesday evening there was a dinner-dance at the country club. When the guests strolled in Bernice found her place-card with a slight feeling of irritation. Though at her right sat G. Reece Stoddard, a most desirable and distinguished young bachelor, the all-important left held only Charley Paulson. Charley lacked height, beauty, and social shrewdness, and in her new enlightenment Bernice decided that his only qualification to be her partner was that he had never been stuck with her. But this feeling of irritation left with the last of the soup-plates, and Marjorie's specific instruction came to her. Swallowing her pride she turned to Charley Paulson and plunged.

“Do you think I ought to bob my hair, Mr. Charley Paulson?”

Charley looked up in surprise.

“Why?”

“Because I'm considering it. It's such a sure and easy way of attracting attention.”

Charley smiled pleasantly. He could not know this had been rehearsed. He replied that he didn't know much about bobbed hair. But Bernice was there to tell him.

“I want to be a society vampire, you see,” she announced coolly, and went on to inform him that bobbed hair was the necessary prelude. She added that she wanted to ask his advice, because she had heard he was so critical about girls.

Charley, who knew as much about the psychology of women as he did of the mental states of Buddhist contemplatives, felt vaguely flattered.

“So I've decided,” she continued, her voice rising slightly, “that early next week I'm going down to the Sevier Hotel barber-shop, sit in the first chair, and get my hair bobbed.” She faltered noticing that the people near her had paused in their conversation and were listening; but after a confused second Marjorie's coaching told, and she finished her paragraph to the vicinity at large. “Of course I'm charging admission, but if you'll all come down and encourage me I'll issue passes for the inside seats.”

There was a ripple of appreciative laughter, and under cover of it G. Reece Stoddard leaned over quickly and said close to her ear: “I'll take a box right now.”

She met his eyes and smiled as if he had said something surprisingly brilliant.

“Do you believe in bobbed hair?” asked G. Reece in the same undertone.

“I think it's unmoral,” affirmed Bernice gravely. “But, of course, you've either got to amuse people or feed 'em or shock 'em.” Marjorie had culled this from Oscar Wilde. It was greeted with a ripple of laughter from the men and a series of quick, intent looks from the girls. And then as though she had said nothing of wit or moment Bernice turned again to Charley and spoke confidentially in his ear.

“I want to ask you your opinion of several people. I imagine you're a wonderful judge of character.”

Charley thrilled faintly—paid her a subtle compliment by overturning her water.

Two hours later, while Warren McIntyre was standing passively in the stag line abstractedly watching the dancers and wondering whither and with whom Marjorie had disappeared, an unrelated perception began to creep slowly upon him—a perception that Bernice, cousin to Marjorie, had been cut in on several times in the past five minutes. He closed his eyes, opened them and looked again. Several minutes back she had been dancing with a visiting boy, a matter easily accounted for; a visiting boy would know no better. But now she was dancing with some one else, and there was Charley Paulson headed for her with enthusiastic determination in his eye. Funny—Charley seldom danced with more than three girls an evening.

Warren was distinctly surprised when—the exchange having been effected—the man relieved proved to be none ether than G. Reece Stoddard himself. And G. Reece seemed not at all jubilant at being relieved. Next time Bernice danced near, Warren regarded her intently. Yes, she was pretty, distinctly pretty; and to-night her face seemed really vivacious. She had that look that no woman, however histrionically proficient, can successfully counterfeit—she looked as if she were having a good time. He liked the way she had her hair arranged, wondered if it was brilliantine that made it glisten so. And that dress was becoming—a dark red that set off her shadowy eyes and high coloring. He remembered that he had thought her pretty when she first came to town, before he had realized that she was dull. Too bad she was dull—dull girls unbearable—certainly pretty though.

His thoughts zigzagged back to Marjorie. This disappearance would be like other disappearances. When she reappeared he would demand where she had been—would be told emphatically that it was none of his business. What a pity she was so sure of him! She basked in the knowledge that no other girl in town interested him; she defied him to fall in love with Genevieve or Roberta.

Warren sighed. The way to Marjorie's affections was a labyrinth indeed. He looked up. Bernice was again dancing with the visiting boy. Half unconsciously he took a step out from the stag line in her direction, and hesitated. Then he said to himself that it was charity. He walked toward her—collided suddenly with G. Reece Stoddard.

“Pardon me,” said Warren.

But G. Reece had not stopped to apologize. He had again cut in on Bernice.

That night at one o'clock Marjorie, with one hand on the electric-light switch in the hall, turned to take a last look at Bernice's sparkling eyes.

“So it worked?”

“Oh, Marjorie, yes!” cried Bernice.

“I saw you were having a gay time.”

“I did! The only trouble was that about midnight I ran short of talk. I had to repeat myself—with different men of course. I hope they won't compare notes.”

“Men don't,” said Marjorie, yawning, “and it wouldn't matter if they did—they'd think you were even trickier.”

She snapped out the light, and as they started up the stairs Bernice grasped the banister thankfully. For the first time in her life she had been danced tired.

“You see,” said Marjorie it the top of the stairs, “one man sees another man cut in and he thinks there must be something there. Well, we'll fix up some new stuff to-morrow. Good night.”

“Good night.”

As Bernice took down her hair she passed the evening before her in review. She had followed instructions exactly. Even when Charley Paulson cut in for the eighth time she had simulated delight and had apparently been both interested and flattered. She had not talked about the weather or Eau Claire or automobiles or her school, but had confined her conversation to me, you, and us.

But a few minutes before she fell asleep a rebellious thought was churning drowsily in her brain—after all, it was she who had done it. Marjorie, to be sure, had given her her conversation, but then Marjorie got much of her conversation out of things she read. Bernice had bought the red dress, though she had never valued it highly before Marjorie dug it out of her trunk—and her own voice had said the words, her own lips had smiled, her own feet had danced. Marjorie nice girl—vain, though—nice evening—nice boys—like Warren—Warren—Warren—what's his name—Warren—

She fell asleep.





V


To Bernice the next week was a revelation. With the feeling that people really enjoyed looking at her and listening to her came the foundation of self-confidence. Of course there were numerous mistakes at first. She did not know, for instance, that Draycott Deyo was studying for the ministry; she was unaware that he had cut in on her because he thought she was a quiet, reserved girl. Had she known these things she would not have treated him to the line which began“Hello, Shell Shock!” and continued with the bathtub story—“It takes a frightful lot of energy to fix my hair in the summer—there's so much of it—so I always fix it first and powder my face and put on my hat; then I get into the bathtub, and dress afterward. Don't you think that's the best plan?”

Though Draycott Deyo was in the throes of difficulties concerning baptism by immersion and might possibly have seen a connection, it must be admitted that he did not. He considered feminine bathing an immoral subject, and gave her some of his ideas on the depravity of modern society.

But to offset that unfortunate occurrence Bernice had several signal successes to her credit. Little Otis Ormonde pleaded off from a trip East and elected instead to follow her with a puppylike devotion, to the amusement of his crowd and to the irritation of G. Reece Stoddard, several of whose afternoon calls Otis completely ruined by the disgusting tenderness of the glances he bent on Bernice. He even told her the story of the two-by-four and the dressing-room to show her how frightfully mistaken he and every one else had been in their first judgment of her. Bernice laughed off that incident with a slight sinking sensation.

Of all Bernice's conversation perhaps the best known and most universally approved was the line about the bobbing of her hair.

“Oh, Bernice, when you goin' to get the hair bobbed?”

“Day after to-morrow maybe,” she would reply, laughing. “Will you come and see me? Because I'm counting on you, you know.”

“Will we? You know! But you better hurry up.”

Bernice, whose tonsorial intentions were strictly dishonorable, would laugh again.

“Pretty soon now. You'd be surprised.”

But perhaps the most significant symbol of her success was the gray car of the hypercritical Warren McIntyre, parked daily in front of the Harvey house. At first the parlor-maid was distinctly startled when he asked for Bernice instead of Marjorie; after a week of it she told the cook that Miss Bernice had gotta holda Miss Marjorie's best fella.

And Miss Bernice had. Perhaps it began with Warren's desire to rouse jealousy in Marjorie; perhaps it was the familiar though unrecognized strain of Marjorie in Bernice's conversation; perhaps it was both of these and something of sincere attraction besides. But somehow the collective mind of the younger set knew within a week that Marjorie's most reliable beau had made an amazing face-about and was giving an indisputable rush to Marjorie's guest. The question of the moment was how Marjorie would take it. Warren called Bernice on the phone twice a day, sent her notes, and they were frequently seen together in his roadster, obviously engrossed in one of those tense, significant conversations as to whether or not he was sincere.

Marjorie on being twitted only laughed. She said she was mighty glad that Warren had at last found some one who appreciated him. So the younger set laughed, too, and guessed that Marjorie didn't care and let it go at that.

One afternoon when there were only three days left of her visit Bernice was waiting in the hall for Warren, with whom she was going to a bridge party. She was in rather a blissful mood, and when Marjorie—also bound for the party—appeared beside her and began casually to adjust her hat in the mirror, Bernice was utterly unprepared for anything in the nature of a clash. Marjorie did her work very coldly and succinctly in three sentences.

“You may as well get Warren out of your head,” she said coldly.

“What?” Bernice was utterly astounded.

“You may as well stop making a fool of yourself over Warren McIntyre. He doesn't care a snap of his fingers about you.”

For a tense moment they regarded each other—Marjorie scornful, aloof; Bernice astounded, half-angry, half-afraid. Then two cars drove up in front of the house and there was a riotous honking. Both of them gasped faintly, turned, and side by side hurried out.

All through the bridge party Bernice strove in vain to master a rising uneasiness. She had offended Marjorie, the sphinx of sphinxes. With the most wholesome and innocent intentions in the world she had stolen Marjorie's property. She felt suddenly and horribly guilty. After the bridge game, when they sat in an informal circle and the conversation became general, the storm gradually broke. Little Otis Ormonde inadvertently precipitated it.

“When you going back to kindergarten, Otis?” some one had asked.

“Me? Day Bernice gets her hair bobbed.”

“Then your education's over,” said Marjorie quickly. “That's only a bluff of hers. I should think you'd have realized.”

“That a fact?” demanded Otis, giving Bernice a reproachful glance.

Bernice's ears burned as she tried to think up an effectual come-back. In the face of this direct attack her imagination was paralyzed.

“There's a lot of bluffs in the world,” continued Marjorie quite pleasantly. “I should think you'd be young enough to know that, Otis.”

“Well,” said Otis, “maybe so. But gee! With a line like Bernice's—”

“Really?” yawned Marjorie. “What's her latest bon mot?”

No one seemed to know. In fact, Bernice, having trifled with her muse's beau, had said nothing memorable of late.

“Was that really all a line?” asked Roberta curiously.

Bernice hesitated. She felt that wit in some form was demanded of her, but under her cousin's suddenly frigid eyes she was completely incapacitated.

“I don't know,” she stalled.

“Splush!” said Marjorie. “Admit it!”

Bernice saw that Warren's eyes had left a ukulele he had been tinkering with and were fixed on her questioningly.

“Oh, I don't know!” she repeated steadily. Her cheeks were glowing.

“Splush!” remarked Marjorie again.

“Come through, Bernice,” urged Otis. “Tell her where to get off.”

Bernice looked round again—she seemed unable to get away from Warren's eyes.

“I like bobbed hair,” she said hurriedly, as if he had asked her a question, “and I intend to bob mine.”

“When?” demanded Marjorie.

“Any time.”

“No time like the present,” suggested Roberta.

Otis jumped to his feet.

“Good stuff!” he cried. “We'll have a summer bobbing party. Sevier Hotel barber-shop, I think you said.”

In an instant all were on their feet. Bernice's heart throbbed violently.

“What?” she gasped.

Out of the group came Marjorie's voice, very clear and contemptuous.

“Don't worry—she'll back out!”

“Come on, Bernice!” cried Otis, starting toward the door.

Four eyes—Warren's and Marjorie's—stared at her, challenged her, defied her. For another second she wavered wildly.

“All right,” she said swiftly, “I don't care if I do.”

An eternity of minutes later, riding down-town through the late afternoon beside Warren, the others following in Roberta's car close behind, Bernice had all the sensations of Marie Antoinette bound for the guillotine in a tumbrel. Vaguely she wondered why she did not cry out that it was all a mistake. It was all she could do to keep from clutching her hair with both bands to protect it from the suddenly hostile world. Yet she did neither. Even the thought of her mother was no deterrent now. This was the test supreme of her sportsmanship; her right to walk unchallenged in the starry heaven of popular girls.

Warren was moodily silent, and when they came to the hotel he drew up at the curb and nodded to Bernice to precede him out. Roberta's car emptied a laughing crowd into the shop, which presented two bold plate-glass windows to the street.

Bernice stood on the curb and looked at the sign, Sevier Barber-Shop. It was a guillotine indeed, and the hangman was the first barber, who, attired in a white coat and smoking a cigarette, leaned nonchalantly against the first chair. He must have heard of her; he must have been waiting all week, smoking eternal cigarettes beside that portentous, too-often-mentioned first chair. Would they blindfold her? No, but they would tie a white cloth round her neck lest any of her blood—nonsense—hair—should get on her clothes.

“All right, Bernice,” said Warren quickly.

With her chin in the air she crossed the sidewalk, pushed open the swinging screen-door, and giving not a glance to the uproarious, riotous row that occupied the waiting bench, went up to the first barber.

“I want you to bob my hair.”

The first barber's mouth slid somewhat open. His cigarette dropped to the floor.

“Huh?”

“My hair—bob it!”

Refusing further preliminaries, Bernice took her seat on high. A man in the chair next to her turned on his side and gave her a glance, half lather, half amazement. One barber started and spoiled little Willy Schuneman's monthly haircut. Mr. O'Reilly in the last chair grunted and swore musically in ancient Gaelic as a razor bit into his cheek. Two bootblacks became wide-eyed and rushed for her feet. No, Bernice didn't care for a shine.

Outside a passer-by stopped and stared; a couple joined him; half a dozen small boys' nose sprang into life, flattened against the glass; and snatches of conversation borne on the summer breeze drifted in through the screen-door.

“Lookada long hair on a kid!”

“Where'd yuh get 'at stuff? 'At's a bearded lady he just finished shavin'.”

But Bernice saw nothing, heard nothing. Her only living sense told her that this man in the white coat had removed one tortoise-shell comb and then another; that his fingers were fumbling clumsily with unfamiliar hairpins; that this hair, this wonderful hair of hers, was going—she would never again feel its long voluptuous pull as it hung in a dark-brown glory down her back. For a second she was near breaking down, and then the picture before her swam mechanically into her vision—Marjorie's mouth curling in a faint ironic smile as if to say:

“Give up and get down! You tried to buck me and I called your bluff. You see you haven't got a prayer.”

And some last energy rose up in Bernice, for she clinched her hands under the white cloth, and there was a curious narrowing of her eyes that Marjorie remarked on to some one long afterward.

Twenty minutes later the barber swung her round to face the mirror, and she flinched at the full extent of the damage that had been wrought. Her hair was not curly and now it lay in lank lifeless blocks on both sides of her suddenly pale face. It was ugly as sin—she had known it would be ugly as sin. Her face's chief charm had been a Madonna-like simplicity. Now that was gone and she was—well frightfully mediocre—not stagy; only ridiculous, like a Greenwich Villager who had left her spectacles at home.

As she climbed down from the chair she tried to smile—failed miserably. She saw two of the girls exchange glances; noticed Marjorie's mouth curved in attenuated mockery—and that Warren's eyes were suddenly very cold.

“You see”—her words fell into an awkward pause—“I've done it.”

“Yes, you've—done it,” admitted Warren.

“Do you like it?”

There was a half-hearted“Sure”from two or three voices, another awkward pause, and then Marjorie turned swiftly and with serpentlike intensity to Warren.

“Would you mind running me down to the cleaners?” she asked. “I've simply got to get a dress there before supper. Roberta's driving right home and she can take the others.”

Warren stared abstractedly at some infinite speck out the window. Then for an instant his eyes rested coldly on Bernice before they turned to Marjorie.

“Be glad to,” he said slowly.





VI


Bernice did not fully realize the outrageous trap that had been set for her until she met her aunt's amazed glance just before dinner.

“Why Bernice!”

“I've bobbed it, Aunt Josephine.”

“Why, child!”

“Do you like it?”

“Why Ber-nice!”

“I suppose I've shocked you.”

“No, but what'll Mrs. Deyo think to-morrow night? Bernice, you should have waited until after the Deyos' dance—you should have waited if you wanted to do that.”

“It was sudden, Aunt Josephine. Anyway, why does it matter to Mrs. Deyo particularly?”

“Why child,” cried Mrs. Harvey, “in her paper on ‘The Foibles of the Younger Generation’ that she read at the last meeting of the Thursday Club she devoted fifteen minutes to bobbed hair. It's her pet abomination. And the dance is for you and Marjorie!”

“I'm sorry.”

“Oh, Bernice, what'll your mother say? She'll think I let you do it.”

“I'm sorry.”

Dinner was an agony. She had made a hasty attempt with a curling-iron, and burned her finger and much hair. She could see that her aunt was both worried and grieved, and her uncle kept saying, “Well, I'll be darned!” over and over in a hurt and faintly hostile tone. And Marjorie sat very quietly, intrenched behind a faint smile, a faintly mocking smile.

Somehow she got through the evening. Three boys called; Marjorie disappeared with one of them, and Bernice made a listless unsuccessful attempt to entertain the two others—sighed thankfully as she climbed the stairs to her room at half past ten. What a day!

When she had undressed for the night the door opened and Marjorie came in.

“Bernice,” she said, “I'm awfully sorry about the Deyo dance. I'll give you my word of honor I'd forgotten all about it.”

“'Sall right,” said Bernice shortly. Standing before the mirror she passed her comb slowly through her short hair.

“I'll take you down-town to-morrow,” continued Marjorie, “and the hairdresser'll fix it so you'll look slick. I didn't imagine you'd go through with it. I'm really mighty sorry.”

“Oh, 'sall right!”

“Still it's your last night, so I suppose it won't matter much.”

Then Bernice winced as Marjorie tossed her own hair over her shoulders and began to twist it slowly into two long blond braids until in her cream-colored negligée she looked like a delicate painting of some Saxon princess. Fascinated, Bernice watched the braids grow. Heavy and luxurious they were moving under the supple fingers like restive snakes—and to Bernice remained this relic and the curling-iron and a to-morrow full of eyes. She could see G. Reece Stoddard, who liked her, assuming his Harvard manner and telling his dinner partner that Bernice shouldn't have been allowed to go to the movies so much; she could see Draycott Deyo exchanging glances with his mother and then being conscientiously charitable to her. But then perhaps by to-morrow Mrs. Deyo would have heard the news; would send round an icy little note requesting that she fail to appear—and behind her back they would all laugh and know that Marjorie had made a fool of her; that her chance at beauty had been sacrificed to the jealous whim of a selfish girl. She sat down suddenly before the mirror, biting the inside of her cheek.

“I like it,” she said with an effort. “I think it'll be becoming.”

Marjorie smiled.

“It looks all right. For heaven's sake, don't let it worry you!”

“I won't.”

“Good night, Bernice.”

But as the door closed something snapped within Bernice. She sprang dynamically to her feet, clinching her hands, then swiftly and noiseless crossed over to her bed and from underneath it dragged out her suitcase. Into it she tossed toilet articles and a change of clothing, Then she turned to her trunk and quickly dumped in two drawerfulls of lingerie and summer dresses. She moved quietly, but with deadly efficiency, and in three-quarters of an hour her trunk was locked and strapped and she was fully dressed in a becoming new traveling suit that Marjorie had helped her pick out.

Sitting down at her desk she wrote a short note to Mrs. Harvey, in which she briefly outlined her reasons for going. She sealed it, addressed it, and laid it on her pillow. She glanced at her watch. The train left at one, and she knew that if she walked down to the Marborough Hotel two blocks away she could easily get a taxicab.

Suddenly she drew in her breath sharply and an expression flashed into her eyes that a practiced character reader might have connected vaguely with the set look she had worn in the barber's chair—somehow a development of it. It was quite a new look for Bernice—and it carried consequences.

She went stealthily to the bureau, picked up an article that lay there, and turning out all the lights stood quietly until her eyes became accustomed to the darkness. Softly she pushed open the door to Marjorie's room. She heard the quiet, even breathing of an untroubled conscience asleep.

She was by the bedside now, very deliberate and calm. She acted swiftly. Bending over she found one of the braids of Marjorie's hair, followed it up with her hand to the point nearest the head, and then holding it a little slack so that the sleeper would feel no pull, she reached down with the shears and severed it. With the pigtail in her hand she held her breath. Marjorie had muttered something in her sleep. Bernice deftly amputated the other braid, paused for an instant, and then flitted swiftly and silently back to her own room.

Down-stairs she opened the big front door, closed it carefully behind her, and feeling oddly happy and exuberant stepped off the porch into the moonlight, swinging her heavy grip like a shopping-bag. After a minute's brisk walk she discovered that her left hand still held the two blond braids. She laughed unexpectedly—had to shut her mouth hard to keep from emitting an absolute peal. She was passing Warren's house now, and on the impulse she set down her baggage, and swinging the braids like pieces of ropeflung them at the wooden porch, where they landed with a slight thud. She laughed again, no longer restraining herself.

“Huh,” she giggled wildly. “Scalp the selfish thing!”

Then picking up her staircase she set off at a half-run down the moonlit street.





THE OFFSHORE PIRATE


I


This unlikely story begins on a sea that was a blue dream, as colorful as blue-silk stockings, and beneath a sky as blue as the irises of children's eyes. From the western half of the sky the sun was shying little golden disks at the sea—if you gazed intently enough you could see them skip from wave tip to wave tip until they joined a broad collar of golden coin that was collecting half a mile out and would eventually be a dazzling sunset. About half-way between the Florida shore and the golden collar a white steam-yacht, very young and graceful, was riding at anchor and under a blue-and-white awning aft a yellow-haired girl reclined in a wicker settee reading“The Revolt of the Angels”, by Anatole France.

She was about nineteen, slender and supple, with a spoiled alluring mouth and quick gray eyes full of a radiant curiosity. Her feet, stockingless, and adorned rather than clad in blue-satin slippers which swung nonchalantly from her toes, were perched on the arm of a settee adjoining the one she occupied. And as she read she intermittently regaled herself by a faint application to her tongue of a half-lemon that she held in her hand. The other half, sucked dry, lay on the deck at her feet and rocked very gently to and fro at the almost imperceptible motion of the tide.

The second half-lemon was well-nigh pulpless and the golden collar had grown astonishing in width, when suddenly the drowsy silence which enveloped the yacht was broken by the sound of heavy footsteps and an elderly man topped with orderly gray hair and clad in a white-flannel suit appeared at the head of the companionway. There he paused for a moment until his eyes became accustomed to the sun, and then seeing the girl under the awning he uttered a long even grunt of disapproval.

If he had intended thereby to obtain a rise of any sort he was doomed to disappointment. The girl calmly turned over two pages, turned back one, raised the lemon mechanically to tasting distance, and then very faintly but quite unmistakably yawned.

“Ardita!” said the gray-haired man sternly.

Ardita uttered a small sound indicating nothing.

“Ardita!” he repeated. “Ardita!”

Ardita raised the lemon languidly, allowing three words to slip out before it reached her tongue.

“Oh, shut up.”

“Ardita!”

“What?”

“Will you listen to me—or will I have to get a servant to hold you while I talk to you?”

The lemon descended very slowly and scornfully.

“Put it in writing.”

“Will you have the decency to close that abominable book and discard that damn lemon for two minutes?”

“Oh, can't you lemme alone for a second?”

“Ardita, I have just received a telephone message from the shore—”

“Telephone?” She showed for the first time a faint interest.

“Yes, it was—”

“Do you mean to say,” she interrupted wonderingly, “'at they let you run a wire out here?”

“Yes, and just now—”

“Won't other boats bump into it?”

“No. It's run along the bottom. Five min—”

“Well, I'll be darned! Gosh! Science is golden or something—isn't it?”

“Will you let me say what I started to?”

“Shoot!”

“Well it seems—well, I am up here—”He paused and swallowed several times distractedly. “Oh, yes. Young woman, Colonel Moreland has called up again to ask me to be sure to bring you in to dinner. His son Toby has come all the way from New York to meet you and he's invited several other young people. For the last time, will you—”

“No,” said Ardita shortly, “I won't. I came along on this darn cruise with the one idea of going to Palm Beach, and you knew it, and I absolutely refuse to meet any darn old colonel or any darn young Toby or any darn old young people or to set foot in any other darn old town in this crazy state. So you either take me to Palm Beach or else shut up and go away.”

“Very well. This is the last straw. In your infatuation for this man—a man who is notorious for his excesses—a man your father would not have allowed to so much as mention your name—you have rejected the demi-monde rather than the circles in which you have presumably grown up. From now on—”

“I know,” interrupted Ardita ironically, “from now on you go your way and I go mine. I've heard that story before. You know I'd like nothing better.”

“From now on,” he announced grandiloquently, “you are no niece of mine. I—”

“O-o-o-oh!” The cry was wrung from Ardita with the agony of a lost soul. “Will you stop boring me! Will you go 'way! Will you jump overboard and drown! Do you want me to throw this book at you!”

“If you dare do any—”

Smack!“The Revolt of the Angels”sailed through the air, missed its target by the length of a short nose, and bumped cheerfully down the companionway.

The gray-haired man made an instinctive step backward and then two cautious steps forward. Ardita jumped to her five feet four and stared at him defiantly, her gray eyes blazing.

“Keep off!”

“How dare you!” he cried.

“Because I darn please!”

“You've grown unbearable! Your disposition—”

“You've made me that way! No child ever has a bad disposition unless it's her fancy's fault! Whatever I am, you did it.”

Muttering something under his breath her uncle turned and, walking forward called in a loud voice for the launch. Then he returned to the awning, where Ardita had again seated herself and resumed her attention to the lemon.

“I am going ashore,” he said slowly. “I will be out again at nine o'clock to-night. When I return we start back to New York, where I shall turn you over to your aunt for the rest of your natural, or rather unnatural, life.”

He paused and looked at her, and then all at once something in the utter childishness of her beauty seemed to puncture his anger like an inflated tire, and render him helpless, uncertain, utterly fatuous.

“Ardita,” he said not unkindly, “I'm no fool. I've been round. I know men. And, child, confirmed libertines don't reform until they're tired—and then they're not themselves—they're husks of themselves.” He looked at her as if expecting agreement, but receiving no sight or sound of it he continued. “Perhaps the man loves you—that's possible. He's loved many women and he'll love many more. Less than a month ago, one month, Ardita, he was involved in a notorious affair with that red-haired woman, Mimi Merril; promised to give her the diamond bracelet that the Czar of Russia gave his mother. You know—you read the papers.”

“Thrilling scandals by an anxious uncle,” yawned Ardita. “Have it filmed. Wicked clubman making eyes at virtuous flapper. Virtuous flapper conclusively vamped by his lurid past. Plans to meet him at Palm Beach. Foiled by anxious uncle.”

“Will you tell me why the devil you want to marry him?”

“I'm sure I couldn't say,” said Ardita shortly. “Maybe because he's the only man I know, good or bad, who has an imagination and the courage of his convictions. Maybe it's to get away from the young fools that spend their vacuous hours pursuing me around the country. But as for the famous Russian bracelet, you can set your mind at rest on that score. He's going to give it to me at Palm Beach—if you'll show a little intelligence.”

“How about the—red-haired woman?”

“He hasn't seen her for six months,” she said angrily. “Don't you suppose I have enough pride to see to that? Don't you know by this time that I can do any darn thing with any darn man I want to?”

She put her chin in the air like the statue of France Aroused, and then spoiled the pose somewhat by raising the lemon for action.

“Is it the Russian bracelet that fascinates you?”

“No, I'm merely trying to give you the sort of argument that would appeal to your intelligence. And I wish you'd go 'way,” she said, her temper rising again. “You know I never change my mind. You've been boring me for three days until I'm about to go crazy. I won't go ashore! Won't! Do you hear? Won't!”

“Very well,” he said, “and you won't go to Palm Beach either. Of all the selfish, spoiled, uncontrolled disagreeable, impossible girl I have—”

Splush! The half-lemon caught him in the neck. Simultaneously came a hail from over the side.

“The launch is ready, Mr. Farnam.”

Too full of words and rage to speak, Mr. Farnam cast one utterly condemning glance at his niece and, turning, ran swiftly down the ladder.





II


Five o'clock rolled down from the sun and plumped soundlessly into the sea. The golden collar widened into a glittering island; and a faint breeze that had been playing with the edges of the awning and swaying one of the dangling blue slippers became suddenly freighted with song. It was a chorus of men in close harmony and in perfect rhythm to an accompanying sound of oars cleaving the blue writers. Ardita lifted her head and listened.

“Carrots and Peas,

Beans on their knees,

Pigs in the seas,

Lucky fellows!

Blow us a breeze,

Blow us a breeze,

Blow us a breeze,

With your bellows.”

Ardita's brow wrinkled in astonishment. Sitting very still she listened eagerly as the chorus took up a second verse.

“Onions and beans,

Marshalls and Deans,

Goldbergs and Greens

And Costellos.

Blow us a breeze,

Blow us a breeze,

Blow us a breeze,

With your bellows.”

With an exclamation she tossed her book to the desk, where it sprawled at a straddle, and hurried to the rail. Fifty feet away a large rowboat was approaching containing seven men, six of them rowing and one standing up in the stern keeping time to their song with an orchestra leader's baton.

“Oysters and rocks,

Sawdust and socks,

Who could make clocks

Out of cellos?—”

The leader's eyes suddenly rested on Ardita, who was leaning over the rail spellbound with curiosity. He made a quick movement with his baton and the singing instantly ceased. She saw that he was the only white man in the boat—the six rowers were negroes.

“Narcissus ahoy!” he called politely.

“What's the idea of all the discord?” demanded Ardita cheerfully. “Is this the varsity crew from the county nut farm?”

By this time the boat was scraping the side of the yacht and a great hulking negro in the bow turned round and grasped the ladder. Thereupon the leader left his position in the stern and before Ardita had realized his intention he ran up the ladder and stood breathless before her on the deck.

“The women and children will be spared!” he said briskly. “All crying babies will be immediately drowned and all males put in double irons!”

Digging her hands excitedly down into the pockets of her dress Ardita stared at him, speechless with astonishment.

He was a young man with a scornful mouth and the bright blue eyes of a healthy baby set in a dark sensitive face. His hair was pitch black, damp and curly—the hair of a Grecian statue gone brunette. He was trimly built, trimly dressed, and graceful as an agile quarter-back.

“Well, I'll be a son of a gun!” she said dazedly.

They eyed each other coolly.

“Do you surrender the ship?”

“Is this an outburst of wit?” demanded Ardita. “Are you an idiot—or just being initiated to some fraternity?”

“I asked you if you surrendered the ship.”

“I thought the country was dry,” said Ardita disdainfully. “Have you been drinking finger-nail enamel? You better get off this yacht!”

“What?” the young man's voice expressed incredulity.

“Get off the yacht! You heard me!”

He looked at her for a moment as if considering what she had said.

“No,” said his scornful mouth slowly; “no, I won't get off the yacht. You can get off if you wish.”

Going to the rail be gave a curt command and immediately the crew of the rowboat scrambled up the ladder and ranged themselves in line before him, a coal-black and burly darky at one end and a miniature mulatto of four feet nine at the other. They seemed to be uniformly dressed in some sort of blue costume ornamented with dust, mud, and tatters; over the shoulder of each was slung a small, heavy-looking white sack, and under their arms they carried large black cases apparently containing musical instruments.

“'Ten-shun!” commanded the young man, snapping his own heels together crisply. “Right Driss! Front! Step out here, Babe!”

The smallest negro took a quick step forward and saluted.

“Yas-suh!”

“Take command, go down below, catch the crew and tie 'em up—all except the engineer. Bring him up to me. Oh, and pile those bags by the rail there.”

“Yas-suh!”

Babe saluted again and wheeling about motioned for the five others to gather about him. Then after a short whispered consultation they all filed noiselessly down the companionway.

“Now,” said the young man cheerfully to Ardita, who had witnessed this last scene in withering silence, “if you will swear on your honor as a flapper—which probably isn't worth much—that you'll keep that spoiled little mouth of yours tight shut for forty-eight hours, you can row yourself ashore in our rowboat.”

“Otherwise what?”

“Otherwise you're going to sea in a ship.”

With a little sigh as for a crisis well passed, the young man sank into the settee Ardita had lately vacated and stretched his arms lazily. The corners of his mouth relaxed appreciatively as he looked round at the rich striped awning, the polished brass, and the luxurious fittings of the deck. His eye felt on the book, and then on the exhausted lemon.

“Hm,” he said, “Stonewall Jackson claimed that lemon-juice cleared his head. Your head feel pretty clear?”

Ardita disdained to answer.

“Because inside of five minutes you'll have to make a clear decision whether it's go or stay.”

He picked up the book and opened it curiously.

“‘The Revolt of the Angels’. Sounds pretty good. French, eh?” He stared at her with new interest. “You French?”

“No.”

“What's your name?”

“Farnam.”

“Farnam what?”

“Ardita Farnam.”

“Well Ardita, no use standing up there and chewing out the insides of your mouth. You ought to break those nervous habits while you're young. Come over here and sit down.”

Ardita took a carved jade case from her pocket, extracted a cigarette and lit it with a conscious coolness, though she knew her hand was trembling a little; then she crossed over with her supple, swinging walk, and sitting down in the other settee blew a mouthful of smoke at the awning.

“You can't get me off this yacht,” she raid steadily; “and you haven't got very much sense if you think you'll get far with it. My uncle'll have wirelesses zigzagging all over this ocean by half past six.”

“Hm.”

She looked quickly at his face, caught anxiety stamped there plainly in the faintest depression of the mouth's corners.

“It's all the same to me,” she said, shrugging her shoulders. “'Tisn't my yacht. I don't mind going for a coupla hours' cruise. I'll even lend you that book so you'll have something to read on the revenue boat that takes you up to Sing Sing.”

He laughed scornfully.

“If that's advice you needn't bother. This is part of a plan arranged before I ever knew this yacht existed. If it hadn't been this one it'd have been the next one we passed anchored along the coast.”

“Who are you?” demanded Ardita suddenly. “And what are you?”

“You've decided not to go ashore?”

“I never even faintly considered it.”

“We're generally known,” he said, “all seven of us, as Curtis Carlyle and his Six Black Buddies, late of the Winter Garden and the Midnight Frolic.”

“You're singers?”

“We were until to-day. At present, due to those white bags you see there we're fugitives from justice and if the reward offered for our capture hasn't by this time reached twenty thousand dollars I miss my guess.”

“What's in the bags?” asked Ardita curiously.

“Well,” he said, “for the present we'll call it—mud—Florida mud.”





III


Within ten minutes after Curtis Carlyle's interview with a very frightened engineer the yacht Narcissus was under way, steaming south through a balmy tropical twilight. The little mulatto, Babe, who seems to have Carlyle's implicit confidence, took full command of the situation. Mr. Farnam's valet and the chef, the only members of the crew on board except the engineer, having shown fight, were now reconsidering, strapped securely to their bunks below. Trombone Mose, the biggest negro, was set busy with a can of paint obliterating the name Narcissus from the bow, and substituting the name Hula Hula, and the others congregated aft and became intently involved in a game of craps.

Having given order for a meal to be prepared and served on deck at seven-thirty, Carlyle rejoined Ardita, and, sinking back into his settee, half closed his eyes and fell into a state of profound abstraction.

Ardita scrutinized him carefully—and classed him immedialely as a romantic figure. He gave the effect of towering self-confidence erected on a slight foundation—just under the surface of each of his decisions she discerned a hesitancy that was in decided contrast to the arrogant curl of his lips.

“He's not like me,” she thought. “There's a difference somewhere.”

Being a supreme egotist Ardita frequently thought about herself; never having had her egotism disputed she did it entirely naturally and with no detraction from her unquestioned charm. Though she was nineteen she gave the effect of a high-spirited precocious child, and in the present glow of her youth and beauty all the men and women she had known were but driftwood on the ripples of her temperament. She had met other egotists—in fact she found that selfish people bored her rather less than unselfish people—but as yet there had not been one she had not eventually defeated and brought to her feet.

But though she recognized an egotist in the settee next to her, she felt none of that usual shutting of doors in her mind which meant clearing ship for action; on the contrary her instinct told her that this man was somehow completely pregnable and quite defenseless. When Ardita defied convention—and of late it had been her chief amusement—it was from an intense desire to be herself, and she felt that this man, on the contrary, was preoccupied with his own defiance.

She was much more interested in him than she was in her own situation, which affected her as the prospect of a matineé might affect a ten-year-old child. She had implicit confidence in her ability to take care of herself under any and all circumstances.

The night deepened. A pale new moon smiled misty-eyed upon the sea, and as the shore faded dimly out and dark clouds were blown like leaves along the far horizon a great haze of moonshine suddenly bathed the yacht and spread an avenue of glittering mail in her swift path. From time to time there was the bright flare of a match as one of them lighted a cigarette, but except for the low undertone of the throbbing engines and the even wash of the waves about the stern the yacht was quiet as a dream boat star-bound through the heavens. Round them bowed the smell of the night sea, bringing with it an infinite languor.

Carlyle broke the silence at last.

“Lucky girl,” he sighed, “I've always wanted to be rich—and buy all this beauty.”

Ardita yawned.

“I'd rather be you,” she said frankly.

“You would—for about a day. But you do seem to possess a lot of nerve for a flapper.”

“I wish you wouldn't call me that.”

“Beg your pardon.”

“As to nerve,” she continued slowly, “it's my one redeemiug feature. I'm not afraid of anything in heaven or earth.”

“Hm, I am.”

“To be afraid,” said Ardita, “a person has either to be very great and strong—or else a coward. I'm neither.” She paused for a moment, and eagerness crept into her tone. “But I want to talk about you. What on earth have you done—and how did you do it?”

“Why?” he demanded cynically. “Going to write a movie, about me?”

“Go on,” she urged. “Lie to me by the moonlight. Do a fabulous story.”

A negro appeared, switched on a string of small lights under the awning, and began setting the wicker table for supper. And while they ate cold sliced chicken, salad, artichokes and strawberry jam from the plentiful larder below, Carlyle began to talk, hesitatingly at first, but eagerly as he saw she was interested. Ardita scarcely touched her food as she watched his dark young face—handsome, ironic, faintly ineffectual.

He began life as a poor kid in a Tennessee town, he said, so poor that his people were the only white family in their street. He never remembered any white children—but there were inevitably a dozen pickaninnies streaming in his trail, passionate admirers whom he kept in tow by the vividness of his imagination and the amount of trouble he was always getting them in and out of. And it seemed that this association diverted a rather unusual musical gift into a strange channel.

There had been a colored woman named Belle Pope Calhoun who played the piano at parties given for white children—nice white children that would have passed Curtis Carlyle with a sniff. But the ragged little“poh white”used to sit beside her piano by the hour and try to get in an alto with one of those kazoos that boys hum through. Before he was thirteen he was picking up a living teasing ragtime out of a battered violin in little cafés round Nashville. Eight years later the ragtime craze hit the country, and he took six darkies on the Orpheum circuit. Five of them were boys he had grown up with; the other was the little mulatto, Babe Divine, who was a wharf nigger round New York, and long before that a plantation hand in Bermuda, until he stuck an eight-inch stiletto in his master's back. Almost before Carlyle realized his good fortune he was on Broadway, with offers of engagements on all sides, and more money than he had ever dreamed of.

It was about then that a change began in his whole attitude, a rather curious, embittering change. It was when he realized that he was spending the golden years of his life gibbering round a stage with a lot of black men. His act was good of its kind—three trombones, three saxaphones, and Carlyle's flute—and it was his own peculiar sense of rhythm that made all the difference; but he began to grow strangely sensitive about it, began to hate the thought of appearing, dreaded it from day to day.

They were making money—each contract he signed called for more—but when he went to managers and told them that he wanted to separate from his sextet and go on as a regular pianist, they laughed at him aud told him he was crazy—it would he an artistic suicide. He used to laugh afterward at the phrase“artistic suicide.” They all used it.

Half a dozen times they played at private dances at three thousand dollars a night, and it seemed as if these crystallized all his distaste for his mode of livlihood. They took place in clubs and houses that he couldn't have gone into in the daytime. After all, he was merely playing to rôle of the eternal monkey, a sort of sublimated chorus man. He was sick of the very smell of the theatre, of powder and rouge and the chatter of the greenroom, and the patronizing approval of the boxes. He couldn't put his heart into it any more. The idea of a slow approach to the luxury of liesure drove him wild. He was, of course, progressing toward it, but, like a child, eating his ice-cream so slowly that he couldn't taste it at all.

He wanted to have a lot of money and time and opportunity to read and play, and the sort of men and women round him that he could never have—the kind who, if they thought of him at all, would have considered him rather contemptible; in short he wanted all those things which he was beginning to lump under the general head of aristocracy, an aristocracy which it seemed almost any money could buy except money made as he was making it. He was twenty-five then, without family or education or any promise that he would succeed in a business career. He began speculating wildly, and within three weeks he had lost every cent he had saved.

Then the war came. He went to Plattsburg, and even there his profession followed him. A brigadier-general called him up to headquarters and told him he could serve his country better as a band leader—so he spent the war entertaining celebrities behind the line with a headquarters band. It was not so bad—except that when the infantry came limping back from the trenches he wanted to be one of them. The sweat and mud they wore seemed only one of those ineffable symbols of aristocracy that were forever eluding him.

“It was the private dances that did it. After I came back from the war the old routine started. We had an offer from a syndicate of Florida hotels. It was only a question of time then.”

He broke off and Ardita looked at him expectantly, but he shook his head.

“No,” he said, “I'm going to tell you about it. I'm enjoying it too much, and I'm afraid I'd lose a little of that enjoyment if I shared it with anyone else. I want to hang on to those few breathless, heroic moments when I stood out before them all and let them know I was more than a damn bobbing, squawking clown.”

From up forward came suddenly the low sound of singing. The negroes had gathered together on the deck and their voices rose together in a haunting melody that soared in poignant harmonics toward the moon. And Ardita listens in enchantment.

“Oh down—

Oh down,

Mammy wanna take me downa milky way,

Oh down—

Oh down,

Pappy say to-morra-a-a-ah

But mammy say to-day,

Yes—mammy say to-day!”

Carlyle sighed and was silent for a moment looking up at the gathered host of stars blinking like arc-lights in the warm sky. The negroes' song had died away to a plaintive humming and it seemed as if minute by minute the brightness and the great silence were increasing until he could almost hear the midnight toilet of the mermaids as they combed their silver dripping curls under the moon and gossiped to each other of the fine wrecks they lived on the green opalescent avenues below. “You see,” said Carlyle softly, “this is the beauty I want. Beauty has got to be astonishing, astounding—it's got to burst in on you like a dream, like the exquisite eyes of a girl.”

He turned to her, but she was silent.

“You see, don't you, Anita—I mean, Ardita?”

Again she made no answer. She had been sound asleep for some time.





IV


In the dense sun-flooded noon of next day a spot in the sea before them resolved casually into a green-and-gray islet, apparently composed of a great granite cliff at its northern end which slanted south through a mile of vivid coppice and grass to a sandy beach melting lazily into the surf. When Ardita, reading in her favorite seat, came to the last page of“The Revolt of the Angels”, and slamming the book shut looked up and saw it, she gave a little cry of delight, and called to Carlyle, who was standing moodily by the rail.

“Is this it? Is this where you're going?”

Carlyle shrugged his shoulders carelessly.

“You've got me.” He raised his voice and called up to the acting skipper: “Oh, Babe, is this your island?”

The mulatto's miniature head appeared from round the corner of the deck-house.

“Yas-suh! This yeah's it.”

Carlyle joined Ardita.

“Looks sort of sporting, doesn't it?”

“Yes,” she agreed; “but it doesn't look big enough to be much of a hiding-place.”

“You still putting your faith in those wirelesses your uncle was going to have zigzagging round?”

“No,” said Ardita frankly. “I'm all for you. I'd really like to see you make a get-away.”

He laughed.

“You're our Lady Luck. Guess we'll have to keep you with us as a mascot—for the present anyway.”

“You couldn't very well ask me to swim back,” she said coolly. “If you do I'm going to start writing dime novels founded on that interminable history of your life you gave me last night.”

He flushed and stiffened slightly.

“I'm very sorry I bored you.”

“Oh, you didn't—until just at the end with some story about how furious you were because you couldn't dance with the ladies you played music for.”

He rose angrily.

“You have got a darn mean little tongue.”

“Excuse me,” she said melting into laughter, “but I'm not used to having men regale me with the story of their life ambitions—especially if they've lived such deathly platonic lives.”

“Why? What do men usually regale you with?”

“Oh, they talk about me,” she yawned. “They tell me I'm the spirit of youth and beauty.”

“What do you tell them?”

“Oh, I agree quietly.”

“Does every man you meet tell you he loves you?”

Ardita nodded.

“Why shouldn't he? All life is just a progression toward, and then a recession from, one phrase— ‘I love you.’”

Carlyle laughed and sat down.

“That's very true. That's—that's not bad. Did you make that up?”

“Yes—or rather I found it out. It doesn't mean anything especially. It's just clever.”

“It's the sort of remark,” he said gravely, “that's typical of your class.”

“Oh,” she interrupted impatiently, “don't start that lecture on aristocracy again! I distrust people who can be intense at this hour in the morning. It's a mild form of insanity—a sort of breakfast-food jag. Morning's the time to sleep, swim, and be careless.”

Ten minutes later they had swung round in a wide circle as if to approach the island from the north.

“There's a trick somewhere,” commented Ardita thoughtfully. “He can't mean just to anchor up against this cliff.”

They were heading straight in now toward the solid rock, which must have been well over a hundred feet tall, and not until they were within fifty yards of it did Ardita see their objective. Then she clapped her hands in delight. There was a break in the cliff entirely hidden by a curious overlapping of rock, and through this break the yacht entered and very slowly traversed a narrow channel of crystal-clear water between high gray walls. Then they were riding at anchor in a miniature world of green and gold, a gilded bay smooth as glass and set round with tiny palms, the whole resembling the mirror lakes and twig trees that children set up in sand piles.

“Not so darned bad!” cried Carlyle excitedly. “I guess that little coon knows his way round this corner of the Atlantic.”

His exuberance was contagious, and Ardita became quite jubilant.

“It's an absolutely sure-fire hiding-place!”

“Lordy, yes! It's the sort of island you read about.”

The rowboat was lowered into the golden lake and they pulled to shore.

“Come on,” said Carlyle as they landed in the slushy sand, “we'll go exploring.”

The fringe of palms was in turn ringed in by a round mile of flat, sandy country. They followed it south and brushing through a farther rim of tropical vegetation came out on a pearl-gray virgin beach where Ardita kicked of her brown golf shoes—she seemed to have permanently abandoned stockings—and went wading. Then they sauntered back to the yacht, where the indefatigable Babe had luncheon ready for them. He had posted a lookout on the high cliff to the north to watch the sea on both sides, though he doubted if the entrance to the cliff was generally known—he had never even seen a map on which the island was marked.

“What's its name,” asked Ardita—“the island, I mean?”

“No name 'tall,” chuckled Babe. “Reckin she jus' island, 'at's all.”

In the late afternoon they sat with their backs against great boulders on the highest part of the cliff and Carlyle sketched for her his vague plans. He was sure they were hot after him by this time. The total proceeds of the coup he had pulled off and concerning which he still refused to enlighten her, he estimated as just under a million dollars. He counted on lying up here several weeks and then setting off southward, keeping well outside the usual channels of travel rounding the Horn and heading for Callao, in Peru. The details of coaling and provisioning he was leaving entirely to Babe who, it seemed, had sailed these seas in every capacity from cabin-boy aboard a coffee trader to virtual first mate on a Brazillian pirate craft, whose skipper had long since been hung.

“If he'd been white he'd have been king of South America long ago,” said Carlyle emphatically. “When it comes to intelligence he makes Booker T. Washington look like a moron. He's got the guile of every race and nationality whose blood is in his veins, and that's half a dozen or I'm a liar. He worships me because I'm the only man in the world who can play better ragtime than he can. We used to sit together on the wharfs down on the New York water-front, he with a bassoon and me with an oboe, and we'd blend minor keys in African harmonics a thousand years old until the rats would crawl up the posts and sit round groaning and squeaking like dogs will in front of a phonograph.”

Ardita roared.

“How you can tell 'em!”

Carlyle grinned.

“I swear that's the gos—”

“What you going to do when you get to Callao?” she interrupted.

“Take ship for India. I want to be a rajah. I mean it. My idea is to go up into Afghanistan somewhere, buy up a palace and a reputation, and then after about five years appear in England with a foreign accent and a mysterious past. But India first. Do you know, they say that all the gold in the world drifts very gradually back to India. Something fascinating about that to me. And I want leisure to read—an immense amount.”

“How about after that?”

“Then,” he answered defiantly, “comes aristocracy. Laugh if you want to—but at least you'll have to admit that I know what I want—which I imagine is more than you do.”

“On the contrary,” contradicted Ardita, reaching in her pocket for her cigarette case, “when I met you I was in the midst of a great uproar of all my friends and relatives because I did know what I wanted.”

“What was it?”

“A man.”

He started.

“You mean you were engaged?”

“After a fashion. If you hadn't come aboard I had every intention of slipping ashore yesterday evening—how long ago it seems—and meeting him in Palm Beach. He's waiting there for me with a bracelet that once belonged to Catherine of Russia. Now don't mutter anything about aristocracy,” she put in quickly. “I liked him simply because he had had an imagination and the utter courage of his convictions.”

“But your family disapproved, eh?”

“What there is of it—only a silly uncle and a sillier aunt. It seems he got into some scandal with a red-haired woman name Mimi something—it was frightfully exaggerated, he said, and men don't lie to me—and anyway I didn't care what he'd done; it was the future that counted. And I'd see to that. When a man's in love with me he doesn't care for other amusements. I told him to drop her like a hot cake, and he did.”

“I feel rather jealous,” said Carlyle, frowning—and then he laughed. “I guess I'll just keep you along with us until we get to Callao. Then I'll lend you enough money to get back to the States. By that time you'll have had a chance to think that gentleman over a little more.”

“Don't talk to me like that!” fired up Ardita. “I won't tolerate the parental attitude from anybody! Do you understand me?”

He chuckled and then stopped, rather abashed, as her cold anger seemed to fold him about and chill him.

“I'm sorry,” he offered uncertainly.

“Oh, don't apologize! I can't stand men who say ‘I'm sorry’ in that manly, reserved tone. Just shut up!”

A pause ensued, a pause which Carlyle found rather awkward, but which Ardita seemed not to notice at all as she sat contentedly enjoying her cigarette and gazing out at the shining sea. After a minute she crawled out on the rock and lay with her face over the edge looking down. Carlyle, watching her, reflected how it seemed impossible for her to assume an ungraceful attitude.

“Oh, look,” she cried. “There's a lot of sort of ledges down there. Wide ones of all different heights.”

“We'll go swimming to-night!” she said excitedly. “By moonlight.”

“Wouldn't you rather go in at the beach on the other end?”

“Not a chance. I like to dive. You can use my uncle's bathing suit, only it'll fit you like a gunny sack, because he's a very flabby man. I've got a one-piece that's shocked the natives all along the Atlantic coast from Biddeford Pool to St. Augustine.”

“I suppose you're a shark.”

“Yes, I'm pretty good. And I look cute too. A sculptor up at Rye last summer told me my calves are worth five hundred dollars.”

There didn't seem to be any answer to this, so Carlyle was silent, permitting himself only a discreet interior smile.





V


When the night crept down in shadowy blue and silver they threaded the shimmering channel in the rowboat and, tying it to a jutting rock, began climbing the cliff together. The first shelf was ten feet up, wide, and furnishing a natural diving platform. There they sat down in the bright moonlight and watched the faint incessant surge of the waters almost stilled now as the tide set seaward.

“Are you happy?” he asked suddenly.

She nodded.

“Always happy near the sea. You know,” she went on, “I've been thinking all day that you and I are somewhat alike. We're both rebels—only for different reasons. Two years ago, when I was just eighteen and you were—”

“Twenty-five.”

“—well, we were both conventional successes. I was an utterly devastating débutante and you were a prosperous musician just commissioned in the army—”

“Gentleman by act of Congress,” he put in ironically.

“Well, at any rate, we both fitted. If our corners were not rubbed off they were at least pulled in. But deep in us both was something that made us require more for happiness. I didn't know what I wanted. I went from man to man, restless, impatient, month by month getting less acquiescent and more dissatisfied. I used to sit sometimes chewing at the insides of my mouth and thinking I was going crazy—I had a frightful sense of transiency. I wanted things now—now—now! Here I was—beautiful—I am, aren't I?”

“Yes,” agreed Carlyle tentatively.

Ardita rose suddenly.

“Wait a second. I want to try this delightful-looking sea.”

She walked to the end of the ledge and shot out over the sea, doubling up in mid-air and then straightening out and entering to water straight as a blade in a perfect jack-knife dive.

In a minute her voice floated up to him.

“You see, I used to read all day and most of the night. I began to resent society—”

“Come on up here,” he interrupted. “What on earth are you doing?”

“Just floating round on my back. I'll be up in a minute. Let me tell you. The only thing I enjoyed was shocking people; wearing something quite impossible and quite charming to a fancy-dress party, going round with the fastest men in New York, and getting into some of the most hellish scrapes imaginable.”

The sounds of splashing mingled with her words, and then he heard her hurried breathing as she began climbing up side to the ledge.

“Go on in!” she called.

Obediently he rose and dived. When he emerged, dripping, and made the climb he found that she was no longer on the ledge, but after a frightened he heard her light laughter from another shelf ten feet up. There he joined her and they both sat quietly for a moment, their arms clasped round their knees, panting a little from the climb.

“The family were wild,” she said suddenly. “They tried to marry me off. And then when I'd begun to feel that after all life was scarcely worth living I found something”—her eyes went skyward exultantly—“I found something!”

Carlyle waited and her words came with a rush.

“Courage—just that; courage as a rule of life, and something to cling to always. I began to build up this enormous faith in myself. I began to see that in all my idols in the past some manifestation of courage had unconsciously been the thing that attracted me. I began separating courage from the other things of life. All sorts of courage—the beaten, bloody prize-fighter coming up for more—I used to make men take me to prize-fights; the déclassé woman sailing through a nest of cats and looking at them as if they were mud under her feet; the liking what you like always; the utter disregard for other people's opinions—just to live as I liked always and to die in my own way—Did you bring up the cigarettes?”

He handed one over and held a match for her silently.

“Still,” Ardita continued, “the men kept gathering—old men and young men, my mental and physical inferiors, most of them, but all intensely desiring to have me—to own this rather magnificent proud tradition I'd built up round me. Do you see?”

“Sort of. You never were beaten and you never apologized.”

“Never!”

She sprang to the edge, poised for a moment like a crucified figure against the sky; then describing a dark parabola plunked without a splash between two silver ripples twenty feet below.

Her voice floated up to him again.

“And courage to me meant ploughing through that dull gray mist that comes down on life—not only overriding people and circumstances but overriding the bleakness of living. A sort of insistence on the value of life and the worth of transient things.”

She was climbing up now, and at her last words her head, with the damp yellow hair slicked symmetrically back appeared on his level.

“All very well,” objected Carlyle. “You can call it courage, but your courage is really built, after all, on a pride of birth. You were bred to that defiant attitude. On my gray days even courage is one of the things that's gray and lifeless.”

She was sitting near the edge, hugging her knees and gazing abstractedly at the white moon; he was farther back, crammed like a grotesque god into a niche in the rock.

“I don't want to sound like Pollyanna,” she began, “but you haven't grasped me yet. My courage is faith—faith in the eternal resilience of me—that joy'll come back, and hope and spontaneity. And I feel that till it does I've got to keep my lips shut and my chin high, and my eyes wide—not necessarily any silly smiling. Oh, I've been through hell without a whine quite often—and the female hell is deadlier than the male.”

“But supposing,” suggested Carlyle, “that before joy and hope and all that came back the curtain was drawn on you for good?”

Ardita rose, and going to the wall climbed with some difficulty to the next ledge, another ten or fifteen feet above.

“Why,” she called back, “then I'd have won!”

He edged out till he could see her.

“Better not dive from there! You'll break your back,” he said quickly.

She laughed.

“Not I!”

Slowly she spread her arms and stood there swan-like, radiating a pride in her young perfection that lit a warm glow in Carlyle's heart.

“We're going through the black air with our arms wide and our feet straight out behind like a dolphin's tail, and we're going to think we'll never hit the silver down there till suddenly it'll be all warm round us and full of little kissing, caressing waves.”

Then she was in the air, and Carlyle involuntarily held his breath. He had not realized that the dive was nearly forty feet. It seemed an eternity before he heard the swift compact sound as she reached the sea.

And it was with his glad sigh of relief when her light watery laughter curled up the side of the cliff and into his anxious ears that he knew he loved her.





VI


Time, having no axe to grind, showered down upon them three days of afternoons. When the sun cleared the port-hole of Ardita's cabin an hour after dawn she rose cheerily, donned her bathing-suit, and went up on deck. The negroes would leave their work when they saw her, and crowd, chuckling and chattering, to the rail as she floated, an agile minnow, on and under the surface of the clear water. Again in the cool of the afternoon she would swim—and loll and smoke with Carlyle upon the cliff; or else they would lie on their sides in the sands of the southern beach, talking little, but watching the day fade colorfully and tragically into the infinite languor of a tropical evening.

And with the long, sunny hours Ardita's idea of the episode as incidental, madcap, a sprig of romance in a desert of reality, gradually left her. She dreaded the time when he would strike off southward; she dreaded all the eventualities that presented themselves to her; thoughts were suddenly troublesome and decisions odious. Had prayers found place in the pagan rituals of her soul she would have asked of life only to be unmolested for a while, lazily acquiescent to the ready, naïf flow of Carlyle's ideas, his vivid boyish imagination, and the vein of monomania that seemed to run crosswise through his temperament and colored his every action.

But this is not a story of two on an island, nor concerned primarily with love bred of isolation. It is merely the presentation of two personalities, and its idyllic setting among the palms of the Gulf Stream is quite incidental. Most of us are content to exist and breed and fight for the right to do both, and the dominant idea, the foredoomed attest to control one's destiny, is reserved for the fortunate or unfortunate few. To me the interesting thing about Ardita is the courage that will tarnish with her beauty and youth.

“Take me with you,” she said late one night as they sat lazily in the grass under the shadowy spreading palms. The negroes had brought ashore their musical instruments, and the sound of weird ragtime was drifting softly over on the warm breath of the night. “I'd love to reappear in ten years, as a fabulously wealthy high-caste Indian lady,” she continued.

Carlyle looked at her quickly.

“You can, you know.”

She laughed.

“Is it a proposal of marriage? Extra! Ardita Farnam becomes pirate's bride. Society girl kidnapped by ragtime bank robber.”

“It wasn't a bank.”

“What was it? Why won't you tell me?”

“I don't want to break down your illusions.”

“My dear man, I have no illusions about you.”

“I mean your illusions about yourself.”

She looked up in surprise.

“About myself! What on earth have I got to do with whatever stray felonies you've committed?”

“That remains to be seen.”

She reached over and patted his hand.

“Dear Mr. Curtis Carlyle,” she said softly, “are you in love with me?”

“As if it mattered.”

“But it does—because I think I'm in love with you.”

He looked at her ironically.

“Thus swelling your January total to half a dozen,” he suggested. “Suppose I call your bluff and ask you to come to India with me?”

“Shall I?”

He shrugged his shoulders.

“We can get married in Callao.”

“What sort of life can you offer me? I don't mean that unkindly, but seriously; what would become of me if the people who want that twenty-thousand-dollar reward ever catch up with you?”

“I thought you weren't afraid.”

“I never am—but I won't throw my life away just to show one man I'm not.”

“I wish you'd been poor. Just a little poor girl dreaming over a fence in a warm cow country.”

“Wouldn't it have been nice?”

“I'd have enjoyed astonishing you—watching your eyes open on things. If you only wanted things! Don't you see?”

“I know—like girls who stare into the windows of jewelry-stores.”

“Yes—and want the big oblong watch that's platinum and has diamonds all round the edge. Only you'd decide it was too expensive and choose one of white gold for a hundred dollars. Then I'd say: ‘Expensive? I should say not!’And we'd go into the store and pretty soon the platinum one would be gleaming on your wrist.”

“That sounds so nice and vulgar—and fun, doesn't it?” murmured Ardita.

“Doesn't it? Can't you see us traveling round and spending money right and left, and being worshipped by bell-boys and waiters? Oh, blessed are the simple rich for they inherit the earth!”

“I honestly wish we were that way.”

“I love you, Ardita,” he said gently.

Her face lost its childish look for moment and became oddly grave.

“I love to be with you,” she said, “more than with any man I've ever met. And I like your looks and your dark old hair, and the way you go over the side of the rail when we come ashore. In fact, Curtis Carlyle, I like all the things you do when you're perfectly natural. I think you've got nerve and you know how I feel about that. Sometimes when you're around I've been tempted to kiss you suddenly and tell you that you were just an idealistic boy with a lot of caste nonsense in his head. Perhaps if I were just a little bit older and a little more bored I'd go with you. As it is, I think I'll go back and marry—that other man.”

Over across the silver lake the figures of the negroes writhed and squirmed in the moonlight like acrobats who, having been too long inactive, must go through their tacks from sheer surplus energy. In single file they marched, weaving in concentric circles, now with their heads thrown back, now bent over their instruments like piping fauns. And from trombone and saxaphone ceaselessly whined a blended melody, sometimes riotous and jubilant, sometimes haunting and plaintive as a death-dance from the Congo's heart.

“Let's dance,” cried Ardita. “I can't sit still with that perfect jazz going on.”

Taking her hand he led her out into a broad stretch of hard sandy soil that the moon flooded with great splendor. They floated out like drifting moths under the rich hazy light, and as the fantastic symphony wept and exulted and wavered and despaired Ardita's last sense of reality dropped away, and she abandoned her imagination to the dreamy summer scents of tropical flowers and the infinite starry spaces overhead, feeling that if she opened her eyes it would be to find herself dancing with a ghost in a land created by her own fancy.

“This is what I should call an exclusive private dance,” he whispered.

“I feel quite mad—but delightfully mad!”

“We're enchanted. The shades of unnumbered generations of cannibals are watching us from high up on the side of the cliff there.”

“And I'll bet the cannibal women are saying that we dance too close, and that it was immodest of me to come without my nose-ring.”

They both laughed softly—and then their laughter died as over across the lake they heard the trombones stop in the middle of a bar, and the saxaphones give a startled moan and fade out.

“What's the matter?” called Carlyle.

After a moment's silence they made out the dark figure of a man rounding the silver lake at a run. As he came closer they saw it was Babe in a state of unusual excitement. He drew up before them and gasped out his news in a breath.

“Ship stan'in' off sho' 'bout half a mile, suh. Mose, he uz on watch, he say look's if she's done ancho'd.”

“A ship—what kind of a ship?” demanded Carlyle anxiously.

Dismay was in his voice, and Ardita's heart gave a sudden wrench as she saw his whole face suddenly droop.

“He say he don't know, suh.”

“Are they landing a boat?”

“No, suh.”

“We'll go up,” said Carlyle.

They ascended the hill in silence, Ardita's hand still resting in Carlyle's as it had when they finished dancing. She felt it clinch nervously from time to time as though he were unaware of the contact, but though he hurt her she made no attempt to remove it. It seemed an hour's climb before they reached the top and crept cautiously across the silhouetted plateau to the edge of the cliff. After one short look Carlyle involuntarily gave a little cry. It was a revenue boat with six-inch guns mounted fore and aft.

“They know!” he said with a short intake of breath. “They know! They picked up the trail somewhere.”

“Are you sure they know about the channel? They may be only standing by to take a look at the island in the morning. From where they are they couldn't see the opening in the cliff.”

“They could with field-glasses,” he said hopelessly. He looked at his wrist watch. “It's nearly two now. They won't do anything until dawn, that's certain. Of course there's always the faint possibility that they're waiting for some other ship to join; or for a coaler.”

“I suppose we may as well stay right here.”

The hour passed and they lay there side by side, very silently, their chins in their hands like dreaming children. In back of them squatted the negroes, patient, resigned, acquiescent, announcing now and then with sonorous snores that not even the presence of danger could subdue their unconquerable African craving for sleep.

Just before five o'clock Babe approached Carlyle. There were half a dozen rifles aboard the Narcissus he said. Had it been decided to offer no resistance?

A pretty good fight might be made, he thought, if they worked out some plan.

Carlyle laughed and shook his head.

“That isn't a Spic army out there, Babe. That's a revenue boat. It'd be like a bow and arrow trying to fight a machine-gun. If you want to bury those bags somewhere and take a chance on recovering them later, go on and do it. But it won't work—they'd dig this island over from one end to the other. It's a lost battle all round, Babe.”

Babe inclined his head silently and turned away, and Carlyle's voice was husky as he turned to Ardita.

“There's the best friend I ever had. He'd die for me, and be proud to, if I'd let him.”

“You've given up?”

“I've no choice. Of course there's always one way out—the sure way—but that can wait. I wouldn't miss my trial for anything—it'll be an interesting experiment in notoriety. ‘Miss Farnam testifies that the pirate's attitude to her was at all times that of a gentleman.’”

“Don't!” she said. “I'm awfully sorry.”

When the color faded from the sky and lustreless blue changed to leaden gray a commotion was visible on the ship's deck, and they made out a group of officers clad in white duck, gathered near the rail. They had field-glasses in their hands and were attentively examining the islet.

“It's all up,” said Carlyle grimly.

“Damn,” whispered Ardita. She felt tears gathering in her eyes. “We'll go back to the yacht,” he said. “I prefer that to being hunted out up here like a 'possum.”

Leaving the plateau they descended the hill, and reaching the lake were rowed out to the yacht by the silent negroes. Then, pale and weary, they sank into the settees and waited.

Half an hour later in the dim gray light the nose of the revenue boat appeared in the channel and stopped, evidently fearing that the bay might be too shallow. From the peaceful look of the yacht, the man and the girl in the settees, and the negroes lounging curiously against the rail, they evidently judged that there would be no resistance, for two boats were lowered casually over the side, one containing an officer and six bluejackets, and the other, four rowers and in the stern two gray-haired men in yachting flannels. Ardita and Carlyle stood up, and half unconsciously started toward each other. Then he paused and putting his hand suddenly into his pocket he pulled out a round, glittering object and held it out to her.

“What is it?” she asked wonderingly.

“I'm not positive, but I think from the Russian inscription inside that it's your promised bracelet.”

“Where—where on earth—”

“It came out of one of those bags. You see, Curtis Carlyle and his Six Black Buddies, in the middle of their performance in the tea-room of the hotel at Palm Beach, suddenly changed their instruments for automatics and held up the crowd. I took this bracelet from a pretty, overrouged woman with red hair.”

Ardita frowned and then smiled.

“So that's what you did! You have got nerve!”

He bowed.

“A well-known bourgeois quality,” he said.

And then dawn slanted dynamically across the deck and flung the shadows reeling into gray corners. The dew rose and turned to golden mist, thin as a dream, enveloping them until they seemed gossamer relics of the late night, infinitely transient and already fading. For a moment sea and sky were breathless, and dawn held a pink hand over the young mouth of life—then from out in the lake came the complaint of a rowboat and the swish of oars.

Suddenly against the golden furnace low in the east their two graceful figures melted into one, and he was kissing her spoiled young mouth.

“It's a sort of glory,” he murmured after a second.

She smiled up at him.

“Happy, are you?”

Her sigh was a benediction—an ecstatic surety that she was youth and beauty now as much as she would ever know. For another instant life was radiant and time a phantom and their strength eternal—then there was a bumping, scraping sound as the rowboat scraped alongside.

Up the ladder scrambled the two gray-haired men, the officer and two of the sailors with their hands on their revolvers. Mr. Farnam folded his arms and stood looking at his niece.

“So,” he said nodding his head slowly.

With a sigh her arms unwound from Carlyle's neck, and her eyes, trans figured and far away, fell upon the boarding party. Her uncle saw her upper lip slowly swell into that arrogant pout he knew so well.

“So,” he repeated savagely. “So this is your idea of—of romance. A runaway affair, with a high-seas pirate.”

Ardita glanced at him carelessly.

“What an old fool you are!” she said quietly.

“Is that the best you can say for yourself?”

“No,” she said as if considering. “No, there's something else. There's that well-known phrase with which I have ended most of our conversations for the past few years— ‘Shut up!’”

And with that she turned, included the two old men, the officer, and the two sailors in a curt glance of contempt, and walked proudly down the companionway.

But had she waited an instant longer she would have heard a sound from her uncle quite unfamiliar in most of their interviews. He gave vent to a whole-hearted amused chuckle, in which the second old man joined.

The latter turned briskly to Carlyle, who had been regarding this scene with an air of cryptic amusement.

“Well Toby,” he said genially, “you incurable, hare-brained romantic chaser of rainbows, did you find that she was the person you wanted?”

Carlyle smiled confidently.

“Why—naturally,” he said, “I've been perfectly sure ever since I first heard tell of her wild career. That'd why I had Babe send up the rocket last night.”

“I'm glad you did,” said Colonel Moreland gravely. “We've been keeping pretty close to you in case you should have trouble with those six strange niggers. And we hoped we'd find you two in some such compromising position,” he sighed. “Well, set a crank to catch a crank!”

“Your father and I sat up all night hoping for the best—or perhaps it's the worst. Lord knows you're welcome to her, my boy. She's run me crazy. Did you give her the Russian bracelet my detective got from that Mimi woman?”

Carlyle nodded.

“Sh!” he said. “She's coming on deck.”

Ardita appeared at the head of the companionway and gave a quick involuntary glance at Carlyle's wrists. A puzzled look passed across her face. Back aft the negroes had begun to sing, and the cool lake, fresh with dawn, echoed serenely to their low voices.

“Ardita,” said Carlyle unsteadily.

She swayed a step toward him.

“Ardita,” he repeated breathlessly, “I've got to tell you the—the truth. It was all a plant, Ardita. My name isn't Carlyle. It's Moreland, Toby Moreland. The story was invented, Ardita, invented out of thin Florida air.”

She stared at him, bewildered, amazement, disbelief, and anger flowing in quick waves across her face. The three men held their breaths. Moreland, Senior, took a step toward her; Mr. Farnam's mouth dropped a little open as he waited, panic-stricken, for the expected crash.

But it did not come. Ardita's face became suddenly radiant, and with a little laugh she went swiftly to young Moreland and looked up at him without a trace of wrath in her gray eyes.

“Will you swear,” she said quietly, “that it was entirely a product of your own brain?”

“I swear,” said young Moreland eagerly.

She drew his head down and kissed him gently.

“What an imagination!” she said softly and almost enviously. “I want you to lie to me just as sweetly as you know how for the rest of my life.”

The negroes' voices floated drowsily back, mingled in an air that she had heard them singing before.

“Time is a thief;

Gladness and grief

Cling to the leaf

As it yellows—”

“What was in the bags?” she asked softly.

“Florida mud,” he answered. “That was one of the two true things I told you.”

“Perhaps I can guess the other one,” she said; and reaching up on her tiptoes she kissed him softly in the illustration.





MAY DAY


There had been a war fought and won and the great city of the conquering people was crossed with triumphal arches and vivid with thrown flowers of white, red, and rose. All through the long spring days the returning soldiers marched up the chief highway behind the strump of drums and the joyous, resonant wind of the brasses, while merchants and clerks left their bickerings and figurings and, crowding to the windows, turned their white-bunched faces gravely upon the passing battalions.

Never had there been such splendor in the great city, for the victorious war had brought plenty in its train, and the merchants had flocked thither from the South and West with their households to taste of all the luscious feasts and witness the lavish entertainments prepared—and to buy for their women furs against the next winter and bags of golden mesh and varicolored slippers of silk and silver and rose satin and cloth of gold.

So gaily and noisily were the peace and prosperity impending hymned by the scribes and poets of the conquering people that more and more spenders had gathered from the provinces to drink the wine of excitement, and faster and faster did the merchants dispose of their trinkets and slippers until they sent up a mighty cry for more trinkets and more slippers in order that they might give in barter what was demanded of them. Some even of them flung up their hands helplessly, shouting:

“Alas! I have no more slippers! And alas! I have no more trinkets! May heaven help me for I know not what I shall do!”

But no one listened to their great outcry, for the throngs were far too busy—day by day, the foot-soldiers trod jauntily the highway and all exulted because the young men returning were pure and brave, sound of tooth and pink of cheek, and the young women of the land were virgins and comely both of face and of figure.

So during all this time there were many adventures that happened in the great city, and, of these, several—or perhaps one—are here set down.





I


At nine o'clock on the morning of the first of May, 1919, a young man spoke to the room clerk at the Biltmore Hotel, asking if Mr. Philip Dean were registered there, and if so, could he be connected with Mr. Dean's rooms. The inquirer was dressed in a well-cut, shabby suit. He was small, slender, and darkly handsome; his eyes were framed above with unusually long eyelashes and below with the blue semicircle of ill health, this latter effect heightened by an unnatural glow which colored his face like a low, incessant fever.

Mr. Dean was staying there. The young man was directed to a telephone at the side.

After a second his connection was made; a sleepy voice hello'd from somewhere above.

“Mr. Dean?” —this very eagerly—“it's Gordon, Phil. It's Gordon Sterrett. I'm down-stairs. I heard you were in New York and I had a hunch you'd be here.”

The sleepy voice became gradually enthusiastic. Well, how was Gordy, old boy! Well, he certainly was surprised and tickled! Would Gordy come right up, for Pete's sake!

A few minutes later Philip Dean, dressed in blue silk pajamas, opened his door and the two young men greeted each other with a half-embarrassed exuberance. They were both about twenty-four, Yale graduates of the year before the war; but there the resemblance stopped abruptly. Dean was blond, ruddy, and rugged under his thin pajamas. Everything about him radiated fitness and bodily comfort. He smiled frequently, showing large and prominent teeth.

“I was going to look you up,” he cried enthusiastically. “I'm taking a couple of weeks off. If you'll sit down a sec I'll be right with you. Going to take a shower.”

As he vanished into the bathroom his visitor's dark eyes roved nervously around the room, resting for a moment on a great English traveling bag in the corner and on a family of thick silk shirts littered on the chairs amid impressive neckties and soft woollen socks.

Gordon rose and, picking up one of the shirts, gave it a minute examination. It was of very heavy silk, yellow, with a pale blue stripe—and there were nearly a dozen of them. He stared involuntarily at his own shirt-cuffs—they were ragged and linty at the edges and soiled to a faint gray. Dropping the silk shirt, he held his coat-sleeves down and worked the frayed shirt-cuffs up till they were out of sight. Then he went to the mirror and looked at himself with listless, unhappy interest. His tie, of former glory, was faded and thumb-creased—it served no longer to hide the jagged buttonholes of his collar. He thought, quite without amusement, that only three years before he had received a scattering vote in the senior elections at college for being the best-dressed man in his class.

Dean emerged from the bathroom polishing his body.

“Saw an old friend of yours last night,” he remarked. “Passed her in the lobby and couldn't think of her name to save my neck. That girl you brought up to New Haven senior year.”

Gordon started.

“Edith Bradin? That whom you mean?”

“'At's the one. Damn good looking. She's still sort of a pretty doll—you know what I mean: as if you touched her she'd smear.”

He surveyed his shining self complacently in the mirror, smiled faintly, exposing a section of teeth.

“She must be twenty-three anyway,” he continued.

“Twenty-two last month,” said Gordon absently.

“What? Oh, last month. Well, I imagine she's down for the Gamma Psi dance. Did you know we're having a Yale Gamma Psi dance to-night at Delmonico's? You better come up, Gordy. Half of New Haven'll probably be there. I can get you an invitation.”

Draping himself reluctantly in fresh underwear, Dean lit a cigarette and sat down by the open window, inspecting his calves and knees under the morning sunshine which poured into the room.

“Sit down, Gordy,” he suggested, “and tell me all about what you've been doing and what you're doing now and everything.”

Gordon collapsed unexpectedly upon the bed; lay there inert and spiritless. His mouth, which habitually dropped a little open when his face was in repose, became suddenly helpless and pathetic.

“What's the matter?” asked Dean quickly.

“Oh, God!”

“What's the matter?”

“Every God damn thing in the world,” he said miserably, “I've absolutely gone to pieces, Phil. I'm all in.”

“Huh?”

“I'm all in.” His voice was shaking.

Dean scrutinized him more closely with appraising blue eyes.

“You certainly look all shot.”

“I am. I've made a hell of a mess of everything.” He paused. “I'd better start at the beginning—or will it bore you?”

“Not at all; go on.” There was, however, a hesitant note in Dean's voice. This trip East had been planned for a holiday—to find Gordon Sterrett in trouble exasperated him a little.

“Go on,” he repeated, and then added half under his breath. “Get it over with.”

“Well,” began Gordon unsteadily, “I got back from France in February, went home to Harrisburg for a month, and then came down to New York to get a job. I got one—with an export company. They fired me yesterday.”

“Fired you?”

“I'm coming to that, Phil. I want to tell you frankly. You're about the only man I can turn to in a matter like this. You won't mind if I just tell you frankly, will you, Phil?”

Dean stiffened a bit more. The pats he was bestowing on his knees grew perfunctory. He felt vaguely that he was being unfairly saddled with responsibility; he was not even sure he wanted to be told. Though never surprised at finding Gordon Sterrett in mild difficulty, there was something in this present misery that repelled him and hardened him, even though it excited his curiosity.

“Go on.”

“It's a girl.”

“Hm.” Dean resolved that nothing was going to spoil his trip. If Gordon was going to be depressing, then he'd have to see less of Gordon.

“Her name is Jewel Hudson,” went on the distressed voice from the bed. “She used to be ‘pure,’ I guess, up to about a year ago. Lived here in New York—poor family. Her people are dead now and she lives with an old aunt. You see it was just about the time I met her that everybody began to come back from France in droves—and all I did was to welcome the newly arrived and go on parties with 'em. That's the way it started, Phil, just from being glad to see everybody and having them glad to see me.”

“You ought to 've had more sense.”

“I know,” Gordon paused, and then continued listlessly. “I'm on my own now, you know, and Phil, I can't stand being poor. Then came this darn girl. She sort of fell in love with me for a while and, though I never intended to get so involved, I'd always seem to run into her somewhere. You can imagine the sort of work I was doing for those exporting people—of course, I always intended to draw; do illustrating for magazines; there's a pile of money in it.”

“Why didn't you? You've got to buckle down if you want to make good,” suggested Dean with cold formalism.

“I tried, a little, but my stuff's crude. I've got talent, Phil; I can draw—but I just don't know how. I ought to go to art school and I can't afford it. Well, things came to a crisis about a week ago. Just as I was down to about my last dollar this girl began bothering me. She wants some money; claims she can make trouble for me if she doesn't get it.”

“Can she?”

“I'm afraid she can. That's one reason I lost my job—she kept calling up the office all the time, and that was sort of the last straw down there. She's got a letter all written to send to my family. Oh, she's got me, all right. I've got to have some money for her.”

There was an awkward pause. Gordon lay very still, his hands clenched by his side.

“I'm all in,” he continued, his voice trembling. “I'm half crazy, Phil. If I hadn't known you were coming East, I think I'd have killed myself. I want you to lend me three hundred dollars.”

Dean's hands, which had been patting his bare ankles, were suddenly quiet—and the curious uncertainty playing between the two became taut and strained.

After a second Gordon continued:

“I've bled the family until I'm ashamed to ask for another nickel.”

Still Dean made no answer.

“Jewel says she's got to have two hundred dollars.”

“Tell her where she can go.”

“Yes, that sounds easy, but she's got a couple of drunken letters I wrote her. Unfortunately she's not at all the flabby sort of person you'd expect.”

Dean made an expression of distaste.

“I can't stand that sort of woman. You ought to have kept away.”

“I know,” admitted Gordon wearily.

“You've got to look at things as they are. If you haven't got money you've got to work and stay away from women.”

“That's easy for you to say,” began Gordon, his eyes narrowing. “You've got all the money in the world.”

“I most certainly have not. My family keep darn close tab on what I spend. Just because I have a little leeway I have to be extra careful not to abuse it.”

He raised the blind and let in a further flood of sunshine.

“I'm no prig, Lord knows,” he went on deliberately. “I like pleasure—and I like a lot of it on a vacation like this, but you're—you're in awful shape. I never heard you talk just this way before. You seem to be sort of bankrupt—morally as well as financially.”

“Don't they usually go together?”

Dean shook his head impatiently.

“There's a regular aura about you that I don't understand. It's a sort of evil.”

“It's an air of worry and poverty and sleepless nights,” said Gordon, rather defiantly.

“I don't know.”

“Oh, I admit I'm depressing. I depress myself. But, my God, Phil, a week's rest and a new suit and some ready money and I'd be like—like I was. Phil, I can draw like a streak, and you know it. But half the time I haven't had the money to buy decent drawing materials—and I can't draw when I'm tired and discouraged and all in. With a little ready money I can take a few weeks off and get started.”

“How do I know you wouldn't use it on some other woman?”

“Why rub it in?” said Gordon, quietly.

“I'm not rubbing it in. I hate to see you this way.”

“Will you lend me the money, Phil?”

“I can't decide right off. That's a lot of money and it'll be darn inconvenient for me.”

“It'll be hell for me if you can't—I know I'm whining, and it's all my own fault but—that doesn't change it.”

“When could you pay it back?”

This was encouraging. Gordon considered. It was probably wisest to be frank.

“Of course, I could promise to send it back next month, but—I'd better say three months. Just as soon as I start to sell drawings.”

“How do I know you'll sell any drawings?”

A new hardness in Dean's voice sent a faint chill of doubt over Gordon. Was it possible that he wouldn't get the money?

“I supposed you had a little confidence in me.”

“I did have—but when I see you like this I begin to wonder.”

“Do you suppose if I wasn't at the end of my rope I'd come to you like this? Do you think I'm enjoying it?” He broke off and bit his lip, feeling that he had better subdue the rising anger in his voice. After all, he was the suppliant.

“You seem to manage it pretty easily,” said Dean angrily. “You put me in the position where, if I don't lend it to you, I'm a sucker—oh, yes, you do. And let me tell you it's no easy thing for me to get hold of three hundred dollars. My income isn't so big but that a slice like that won't play the deuce with it.”

He left his chair and began to dress, choosing his clothes carefully. Gordon stretched out his arms and clenched the edges of the bed, fighting back a desire to cry out. His head was splitting and whirring, his mouth was dry and bitter and he could feel the fever in his blood resolving itself into innumerable regular counts like a slow dripping from a roof.

Dean tied his tie precisely, brushed his eyebrows, and removed a piece of tobacco from his teeth with solemnity. Next he filled his cigarette case, tossed the empty box thoughtfully into the waste basket, and settled the case in his vest pocket.

“Had breakfast?” he demanded.

“No; I don't eat it any more.”

“Well, we'll go out and have some. We'll decide about that money later. I'm sick of the subject. I came East to have a good time.

“Let's go over to the Yale Club,” he continued moodily, and then added with an implied reproof: “You've given up your job. You've got nothing else to do.”

“I'd have a lot to do if I had a little money,” said Gordon pointedly.

“Oh, for Heaven's sake drop the subject for a while! No point in glooming on my whole trip. Here, here's some money.”

He took a five-dollar bill from his wallet and tossed it over to Gordon, who folded it carefully and put it in his pocket. There was an added spot of color in his cheeks, an added glow that was not fever. For an instant before they turned to go out their eyes met and in that instant each found something that made him lower his own glance quickly. For in that instant they quite suddenly and definitely hated each other.





II


Fifth Avenue and Forty-fourth Street swarmed with the noon crowd. The wealthy, happy sun glittered in transient gold through the thick windows of the smart shops, lighting upon mesh bags and purses and strings of pearls in gray velvet cases; upon gaudy feather fans of many colors; upon the laces and silks of expensive dresses; upon the bad paintings and the fine period furniture in the elaborate show rooms of interior decorators.

Working-girls, in pairs and groups and swarms, loitered by these windows, choosing their future boudoirs from some resplendent display which included even a man's silk pajamas laid domestically across the bed. They stood in front of the jewelry stores and picked out their engagement rings, and their wedding rings and their platinum wrist watches, and then drifted on to inspect the feather fans and opera cloaks; meanwhile digesting the sandwiches and sundaes they had eaten for lunch.

All through the crowd were men in uniform, sailors from the great fleet anchored in the Hudson, soldiers with divisional insignia from Massachusetts to California, wanting fearfully to be noticed, and finding the great city thoroughly fed up with soldiers unless they were nicely massed into pretty formations and uncomfortable under the weight of a pack and rifle. Through this medley Dean and Gordon wandered; the former interested, made alert by the display of humanity at its frothiest and gaudiest; the latter reminded of how often he had been one of the crowd, tired, casually fed, overworked, and dissipated. To Dean the struggle was significant, young, cheerful; to Gordon it was dismal, meaningless, endless.

In the Yale Club they met a group of their former classmates who greeted the visiting Dean vociferously. Sitting in a semicircle of lounges and great chairs, they had a highball all around.

Gordon found the conversation tiresome and interminable. They lunched together en masse, warmed with liquor as the afternoon began. They were all going to the Gamma Psi dance that night—it promised to be the best party since the war.

“Edith Bradin's coming,” said some one to Gordon. “Didn't she used to be an old flame of yours? Aren't you both from Harrisburg?”

“Yes.” He tried to change the subject. “I see her brother occasionally. He's sort of a socialistic nut. Runs a paper or something here in New York.”

“Not like his gay sister, eh?” continued his eager informant. “Well, she's coming to-night—with a junior named Peter Himmel.”

Gordon was to meet Jewel Hudson at eight o'clock—he had promised to have some money for her. Several times he glanced nervously at his wrist watch. At four, to his relief, Dean rose and announced that he was going over to Rivers Brothers to buy some collars and ties. But as they left the Club another of the party joined them, to Gordon's great dismay. Dean was in a jovial mood now, happy, expectant of the evening's party, faintly hilarious. Over in Rivers' he chose a dozen neckties, selecting each one after long consultations with the other man. Did he think narrow ties were coming back? And wasn't it a shame that Rivers couldn't get any more Welsh Margotson collars? There never was a collar like the“Covington.”

Gordon was in something of a panic. He wanted the money immediately. And he was now inspired also with a vague idea of attending the Gamma Psi dance. He wanted to see Edith—Edith whom he hadn't met since one romantic night at the Harrisburg Country Club just before he went to France. The affair had died, drowned in the turmoil of the war and quite forgotten in the arabesque of these three months, but a picture of her, poignant, debonnaire, immersed in her own inconsequential chatter, recurred to him unexpectedly and brought a hundred memories with it. It was Edith's face that he had cherished through college with a sort of detached yet affectionate admiration. He had loved to draw her—around his room had been a dozen sketches of her—playing golf, swimming—he could draw her pert, arresting profile with his eyes shut.

They left Rivers' at five-thirty and parsed for a moment on the sidewalk.

“Well,” said Dean genially, “I'm all set now. Think I'll go back to the hotel and get a shave, haircut, and massage.”

“Good enough,” said the other man, “I think I'll join you.”

Gordon wondered if he was to be beaten after all. With difficulty he restrained himself from turning to the man and snarling out, “Go on away, damn you!” In despair he suspected that perhaps Dean had spoken to him, was keeping him along in order to avoid a dispute about the money.

They went into the Biltmore—a Biltmore alive with girls—mostly from the West and South, the stellar débutantes of many cities gathered for the dance of a famous fraternity of a famous university. But to Gordon they were faces in a dream. He gathered together his forces for a last appeal, was about to come out with he knew not what, when Dean suddenly excused himself to the other man and taking Gordon's arm led him aside.

“Gordy,” he said quickly, “I've thought the whole thing over carefully and I've decided that I can't lend you that money. I'd like to oblige you, but I don't feel I ought to—it'd put a crimp in me for a month.”

Gordon, watching him dully, wondered why he had never before noticed how much those upper teeth projected.

“—I'm mighty sorry, Gordon,” continued Dean, “but that's the way it is.”

He took out his wallet and deliberately counted out seventy-five dollars in bills.

“Here,” he said, holding them out, “here's seventy-five; that makes eighty all together. That's all the actual cash I have with me, besides what I'll actually spend on the trip.”

Gordon raised his clenched hand automatically, opened it as though it were a tongs he was holding, and clenched it again on the money.

“I'll see you at the dance,” continued Dean. “I've got to get along to the barber shop.”

“So-long,” said Gordon in a strained and husky voice.

“So-long.”

Dean, began to smile, but seemed to change his mind. He nodded briskly and disappeared.

But Gordon stood there, his handsome face awry with distress, the roll of bills clenched tightly in his hand. Then, blinded by sudden tears, he stumbled clumsily down the Biltmore steps.





III


About nine o'clock of the same night two human beings came out of a cheap restaurant in Sixth Avenue. They were ugly, ill-nourished, devoid of all except the very lowest form of intelligence, and without even that animal exuberance that in itself brings color into life; they were lately vermin-ridden, cold, and hungry in a dirty town of a strange land; they were poor, friendless; tossed as driftwood from their births, they would be tossed as driftwood to their deaths. They were dressed in the uniform of the United States Army, and on the shoulder of each was the insignia of a drafted division from New Jersey, landed three days before.

The taller of the two was named Carrol Key, a name hinting that in his veins, however thinly diluted by generations of degeneration, ran blood of some potentiality. But one could stare endlessly at the long, chinless face, the dull, watery eyes, and high cheek-bones, without finding suggestion of either ancestral worth or native resourcefulness.

His companion was swart and bandy-legged, with rat-eyes and a much-broken hooked nose. His defiant air was obviously a pretense, a weapon of protection borrowed from that world of snarl and snap, of physical bluff and physical menace, in which he had always lived. His name was Gus Rose.

Leaving the café they sauntered down Sixth Avenue, wielding toothpicks with great gusto and complete detachment.

“Where to?” asked Rose, in a tone which implied that he would not be surprised if Key suggested the South Sea Islands.

“What you say we see if we can getta holda some liquor?” Prohibition was not yet. The ginger in the suggestion was caused by the law forbidding the selling of liquor to soldiers.

Rose agreed enthusiastically.

“I got an idea,” continued Key, after a moment's thought, “I got a brother somewhere.”

“In New York?”

“Yeah. He's an old fella.” He meant that he was an elder brother. “He's a waiter in a hash joint.”

“Maybe he can get us some.”

“I'll say he can!”

“B'lieve me, I'm goin' to get this darn uniform off me to-morra. Never get me in it again, neither. I'm goin' to get me some regular clothes.”

“Say, maybe I'm not.”

As their combined finances were something less than five dollars, this intention can be taken largely as a pleasant game of words, harmless and consoling. It seemed to please both of them, however, for they reinforced it with chuckling and mention of personages high in biblical circles, adding such further emphasis as“Oh, boy!” “You know!” and“I'll say so!” repeated many times over.

The entire mental pabulum of these two men consisted of an offended nasal comment extended through the years upon the institution—army, business, or poorhouse—which kept them alive, and toward their immediate superior in that institution. Until that very morning the institution had been the“government”and the immediate superior had been the“Cap'n”—from these two they had glided out and were now in the vaguely uncomfortable state before they should adopt their next bondage. They were uncertain, resentful, and somewhat ill at ease. This they hid by pretending an elaborate relief at being out of the army, and by assuring each other that military discipline should never again rule their stubborn, liberty-loving wills. Yet, as a matter of fact, they would have felt more at home in a prison than in this new-found and unquestionable freedom.

Suddenly Key increased his gait. Rose, looking up and following his glance, discovered a crowd that was collecting fifty yards down the street. Key chuckled and began to run in the direction of the crowd; Rose thereupon also chuckled and his short bandy legs twinkled beside the long, awkward strides of his companion.

Reaching the outskirts of the crowd they immediately became an indistinguishable part of it. It was composed of ragged civilians somewhat the worse for liquor, and of soldiers representing many divisions and many stages of sobriety, all clustered around a gesticulating little Jew with long black whiskers, who was waving his arms and delivering an excited but succinct harangue. Key and Rose, having wedged themselves into the approximate parquet, scrutinized him with acute suspicion, as his words penetrated their common consciousness.

“—What have you got outa the war?” he was crying fiercely. “Look arounja, look arounja! Are you rich? Have you got a lot of money offered you?—no; you're lucky if you're alive and got both your legs; you're lucky if you came back an' find your wife ain't gone off with some other fella that had the money to buy himself out of the war! That's when you're lucky! Who got anything out of it except J. P. Morgan an' John D. Rockerfeller?”

At this point the little Jew's oration was interrupted by the hostile impact of a fist upon the point of his bearded chin and he toppled backward to a sprawl on the pavement.

“God damn Bolsheviki!” cried the big soldier-blacksmith, who had delivered the blow. There was a rumble of approval, the crowd closed in nearer.

The Jew staggered to his feet, and immediately went down again before a half-dozen reaching-in fists. This time he stayed down, breathing heavily, blood oozing from his lip where it was cut within and without.

There was a riot of voices, and in a minute Rose and Key found themselves flowing with the jumbled crowd down Sixth Avenue under the leadership of a thin civilian in a slouch hat and the brawny soldier who had summarily ended the oration. The crowd had marvellously swollen to formidable proportions and a stream of more non-committal citizens followed it along the sidewalks lending their moral support by intermittent huzzas.

“Where we goin'?” yelled Key to the man nearest him.

His neighbor pointed up to the leader in the slouch hat.

“That guy knows where there's a lot of 'em! We're goin' to show 'em!”

“We're goin' to show 'em!” whispered Key delightedly to Rose, who repeated the phrase rapturously to a man on the other side.

Down Sixth Avenue swept the procession, joined here and there by soldiers and marines, and now and then by civilians, who came up with the inevitable cry that they were just out of the army themselves, as if presenting it as a card of admission to a newly formed Sporting and Amusement Club.

Then the procession swerved down a cross street and headed for Fifth Avenue and the word filtered here and there that they were bound for a Red meeting at Tolliver Hall.

“Where is it?”

The question went up the line and a moment later the answer floated hack. Tolliver Hall was down on Tenth Street. There was a bunch of other sojers who was goin' to break it up and was down there now!

But Tenth Street had a faraway sound and at the word a general groan went up and a score of the procession dropped out. Among these were Rose and Key, who slowed down to a saunter and let the more enthusiastic sweep on by.

“I'd rather get some liquor,” said Key as they halted and made their way to the sidewalk amid cries of“Shell hole!” and“Quitters!”

“Does your brother work around here?” asked Rose, assuming the air of one passing from the superficial to the eternal.

“He oughta,” replied Key. “I ain't seen him for a coupla years. I been out to Pennsylvania since. Maybe he don't work at night anyhow. It's right along here. He can get us some o'right if he ain't gone.”

They found the place after a few minutes' patrol of the street—a shoddy tablecloth restaurant between Fifth Avenue and Broadway. Here Key went inside to inquire for his brother George, while Rose waited on the sidewalk.

“He ain't here no more,” said Key emerging. “He's a waiter up to Delmonico's.”

Rose nodded wisely, as if he'd expected as much. One should not be surprised at a capable man changing jobs occasionally. He knew a waiter once—there ensued a long conversation as they waited as to whether waiters made more in actual wages than in tips—it was decided that it depended on the social tone of the joint wherein the waiter labored. After having given each other vivid pictures of millionaires dining at Delmonico's and throwing away fifty-dollar bills after their first quart of champagne, both men thought privately of becoming waiters. In fact, Key's narrow brow was secreting a resolution to ask his brother to get him a job.

“A waiter can drink up all the champagne those fellas leave in bottles,” suggested Rose with some relish, and then added as an afterthought, “Oh, boy!”

By the time they reached Delmonico's it was half past ten, and they were surprised to see a stream of taxis driving up to the door one after the other and emitting marvelous, hatless young ladies, each one attended by a stiff young gentleman in evening clothes.

“It's a party,” said Rose with some awe. “Maybe we better not go in. He'll be busy.”

“No, he won't. He'll be o'right.”

After some hesitation they entered what appeared to them to be the least elaborate door and, indecision falling upon them immediately, stationed themselves nervously in an inconspicuous corner of the small dining-room in which they found themselves. They took off their caps and held them in their hands. A cloud of gloom fell upon them and both started when a door at one end of the room crashed open, emitting a comet-like waiter who streaked across the floor and vanished through another door on the other side.

There had been three of these lightning passages before the seekers mustered the acumen to hail a waiter. He turned, looked at them suspiciously, and then approached with soft, catlike steps, as if prepared at any moment to turn and flee.

“Say,” began Key, “say, do you know my brother? He's a waiter here.”

“His name is Key,” annotated Rose.

Yes, the waiter knew Key. He was up-stairs, he thought. There was a big dance going on in the main ballroom. He'd tell him.

Ten minutes later George Key appeared and greeted his brother with the utmost suspicion; his first and most natural thought being that he was going to be asked for money.

George was tall and weak chinned, but there his resemblance to his brother ceased. The waiter's eyes were not dull, they were alert and twinkling, and his manner was suave, indoor, and faintly superior. They exchanged formalities. George was married and had three children. He seemed fairly interested, but not impressed by the news that Carrol had been abroad in the army. This disappointed Carrol.

“George,” said the younger brother, these amenities having been disposed of, “we want to get some booze, and they won't sell us none. Can you get us some?”

George considered.

“Sure. Maybe I can. It may be half an hour, though.”

“All right,” agreed Carrol, “we'll wait.”

At this Rose started to sit down in a convenient chair, but was hailed to his feet by the indignant George.

“Hey! Watch out, you! Can't sit down here! This room's all set for a twelve o'clock banquet.”

“I ain't goin' to hurt it,” said Rose resentfully. “I been through the delouser.”

“Never mind,” said George sternly, “if the head waiter seen me here talkin' he'd romp all over me.”

“Oh.”

The mention of the head waiter was full explanation to the other two; they fingered their overseas caps nervously and waited for a suggestion.

“I tell you,” said George, after a pause, “I got a place you can wait; you just come here with me.”

They followed him out the far door, through a deserted pantry and up a pair of dark winding stairs, emerging finally into a small room chiefly furnished by piles of pails and stacks of scrubbing brushes, and illuminated by a single dim electric light. There he left them, after soliciting two dollars and agreeing to return in half an hour with a quart of whiskey.

“George is makin' money, I bet,” said Key gloomily as he seated himself on an inverted pail. “I bet he's making fifty dollars a week.”

Rose nodded his head and spat.

“I bet he is, too.”

“What'd he say the dance was of?”

“A lot of college fellas. Yale College.”

They both nodded solemnly at each other.

“Wonder where that crowda sojers is now?”

“I don't know. I know that's too damn long to walk for me.”

“Me too. You don't catch me walkin' that far.”

Ten minutes later restlessness seized them.

“I'm goin' to see what's out here,” said Rose, stepping cautiously toward the other door.

It was a swinging door of green baize and he pushed it open a cautious inch.

“See anything?”

For answer Rose drew in his breath sharply.

“Doggone! Here's some liquor I'll say!”

“Liquor?”

Key joined Rose at the door, and looked eagerly.

“I'll tell the world that's liquor,” he said, after a moment of concentrated gazing.

It was a room about twice as large as the one they were in—and in it was prepared a radiant feast of spirits. There were long walls of alternating bottles set along two white covered tables; whiskey, gin, brandy, French and Italian vermouths, and orange juice, not to mention an array of syphons and two great empty punch bowls. The room was as yet uninhabited.

“It's for this dance they're just starting,” whispered Key; “hear the violins playin'? Say, boy, I wouldn't mind havin' a dance.”

They closed the door softly and exchanged a glance of mutual comprehension. There was no need of feeling each other out.

“I'd like to get my hands on a coupla those bottles,” said Rose emphatically.

“Me too.”

“Do you suppose we'd get seen?”

Key considered.

“Maybe we better wait till they start drinkin' 'em. They got 'em all laid out now, and they know how many of them there are.”

They debated this point for several minutes. Rose was all for getting his hands on a bottle now and tucking it under his coat before anyone came into the room. Key, however, advocated caution. He was afraid hemight get his brother in trouble. If they waited till some of the bottles were opened it'd be all right to take one, and everybody'd think it was one of the college fellas.

While they were still engaged in argument George Key hurried through the room and, barely grunting at them, disappeared by way of the green baize door. A minute later they heard several corks pop, and then the sound of cracking ice and splashing liquid. George was mixing the punch.

The soldiers exchanged delighted grins.

“Oh, boy!” whispered Rose.

George reappeared.

“Just keep low, boys,” he said quickly. “I'll have your stuff for you in five minutes.”

He disappeared through the door by which he had come.

As soon as his footsteps receded down the stairs, Rose, after a cautious look, darted into the room of delights and reappeared with a bottle in his hand.

“Here's what I say,” he said, as they sat radiantly digesting their first drink. “We'll wait till he comes up, and we'll ask him if we can't just stay here and drink what he brings us—see. We'll tell him we haven't got any place to drink it—see. Then we can sneak in there whenever there ain't nobody in that there room and tuck a bottle under our coats. We'll have enough to last us a coupla days—see?”

“Sure,” agreed Rose enthusiastically. “Oh, boy! And if we want to we can sell it to sojers any time we want to.”

They were silent for a moment thinking rosily of this idea. Then Key reached up and unhooked the collar of his O. D. coat.

“It's hot in here, ain't it?”

Rose agreed earnestly.

“Hot as hell.”





IV


She was still quite angry when she came out of the dressing-room and crossed the intervening parlor of politeness that opened onto the hall—angry not so much at the actual happening which was, after all, the merest commonplace of her social existence, but because it had occurred on this particular night. She had no quarrel with herself. She had acted with that correct mixture of dignity and reticent pity which she always employed. She had succinctly and deftly snubbed him.

It had happened when their taxi was leaving the Biltmore—hadn't gone half a block. He had lifted his right arm awkwardly—she was on his right side—and attempted to settle it snugly around the crimson fur-trimmed opera cloak she wore. This in itself had been a mistake. It was inevitably more graceful for a young man attempting to embrace a young lady of whose acquiescence he was not certain, to first put his far arm around her. It avoided that awkward movement of raising the near arm.

His second faux pas was unconscious. She had spent the afternoon at the hairdresser's; the idea of any calamity overtaking her hair was extremely repugnant—yet as Peter made his unfortunate attempt the point of his elbow had just faintly brushed it. That was his second faux pas. Two were quite enough.

He had begun to murmur. At the first murmur she had decided that he was nothing but a college boy—Edith was twenty-two, and anyhow, this dance, first of its kind since the war, was reminding her, with the accelerating rhythm of its associations, of something else—of another dance and another man, a man for whom her feelings had been little more than a sad-eyed, adolescent mooniness. Edith Bradin was falling in love with her recollection of Gordon Sterrett.

So she came out of the dressing-room at Delmonico's and stood for a second in the doorway looking over the shoulders of a black dress in front of her at the groups of Yale men who flitted like dignified black moths around the head of the stairs. From the room she had left drifted out the heavy fragrance left by the passage to and fro of many scented young beauties—rich perfumes and the fragile memory-laden dust of fragrant powders. This odor drifting out acquired the tang of cigarette smoke in the hall, and then settled sensuously down the stairs and permeated the ballroom where the Gamma Psi dance was to be held. It was an odor she knew well, exciting, stimulating, restlessly sweet—the odor of a fashionable dance.

She thought of her own appearance. Her bare arms and shoulders were powdered to a creamy white. She knew they looked very soft and would gleam like milk against the black backs that were to silhouette them to-night. The hairdressing had been a success; her reddish mass of hair was piled and crushed and creased to an arrogant marvel of mobile curves. Her lips were finely made of deep carmine; the irises of her eyes were delicate, breakable blue, like china eyes. She was a complete, infinitely delicate, quite perfect thing of beauty, flowing in an even line from a complex coiffure to two small slim feet.

She thought of what she would say to-night at this revel, faintly prestiged already by the sounds of high and low laughter and slippered footsteps, and movements of couples up and down the stairs. She would talk the language she had talked for many years—her line—made up of the current expressions, bits of journalese and college slang strung together into an intrinsic whole, careless, faintly provocative, delicately sentimental. She stalled faintly as she heard a girl sitting on the stairs near her say: “You don't know the half of it, dearie!”

And as she smiled her anger melted for a moment, and closing her eyes she drew in a deep breath of pleasure. She dropped her arms to her side until they were faintly touching the sleek sheath that covered and suggested her figure. She had never felt her own softness so much nor so enjoyed the whiteness of her own arms.

“I smell sweet,” she said to herself simply, and then came another thought—“I'm made for love.”

She liked the sound of this and thought it again; then inevitable succession came her new-born riot of dreams about Gordon. The twist of her imagination which, two months before, had disclosed to her her unguessed desire to see him again, seemed now to have been leading up to this dance, this hour.

For all her sleek beauty, Edith was a grave, slow-thinking girl. There was a streak in her of that same desire to ponder, of that adolescent idealism that had turned her brother socialist and pacifist. Henry Bradin had left Cornell, where he had been an instructor in economies, and had come to New York to pour the latest cures for incurable evils into the columns of a radical weekly newspaper.

Edith, less fatuously, would have been content to cure Gordon Sterrett. There was a quality of weakness in Gordon that she wanted to take care of; there was a helplessness in him that she wanted to protect. And she wanted someone she had known a long while, someone who had loved her a long while. She was a little tired; she wanted to get married. Out of a pile of letters, half a dozen pictures and as many memories, and this weariness, she had decided that next time she saw Gordon their relations were going to be changed. She would say something that would change them. There was this evening. This was her evening. All evenings were her evenings.

Then her thoughts were interrupted by a solemn undergraduate with a hurt look and an air of strained formality who presented himself before her and bowed unusually low. It was the man she had come with, Peter Himmel. He was tall and humorous, with horned-rimmed glasses and an air of attractive whimsicality. She suddenly rather disliked him—probably because he had not succeeded in kissing her.

“Well,” she began, “are you still furious at me?”

“Not at all.”

She stepped forward and took his arm.

“I'm sorry,” she said softly. “I don't know why I snapped out that way. I'm in a bum humor to-night for some strange reason. I'm sorry.”

“S'all right,” he mumbled, “don't mention it.”

He felt disagreeably embarrassed. Was she rubbing in the fact of his late failure?

“It was a mistake,” she continued, on the same consciously gentle key. “We'll both forget it.” For this he hated her.

A few minutes later they drifted out on the floor while the dozen swaying, sighing members of the specially hired jazz orchestra informed the crowded ballroom that“if a saxophone and me are left alone why then two is com-pan-ee!”

A man with a mustache cut in.

“Hello,” he began reprovingly. “You don't remember me.”

“I can't just think of your name,” she said lightly—“and I know you so well.”

“I met you up at—”His voice trailed disconsolately off as a man with very fair hair cut in. Edith murmured a conventional“Thanks, loads—cut in later,” to the inconnu.

The very fair man insisted on shaking hands enthusiastically. She placed him as one of the numerous Jims of her acquaintance—last name a mystery. She remembered even that he had a peculiar rhythm in dancing and found as they started that she was right.

“Going to be here long?” he breathed confidentially.

She leaned back and looked up at him.

“Couple of weeks.”

“Where are you?”

“Biltmore. Call me up some day.”

“I mean it,” he assured her. “I will. We'll go to tea.”

“So do I—Do.”

A dark man cut in with intense formality.

“You don't remember me, do you?” he said gravely.

“I should say I do. Your name's Harlan.”

“No-ope. Barlow.”

“Well, I knew there were two syllables anyway. You're the boy that played the ukulele so well up at Howard Marshall's house party.

“I played—but not—”

A man with prominent teeth cut in. Edith inhaled a slight cloud of whiskey. She liked men to have had something to drink; they were so much more cheerful, and appreciative and complimentary—much easier to talk to.

“My name's Dean, Philip Dean,” he said cheerfully. “You don't remember me, I know, but you used to come up to New Haven with a fellow I roomed with senior year, Gordon Sterrett.”

Edith looked up quickly.

“Yes, I went up with him twice—to the Pump and Slipper and the Junior prom.”

“You've seen him, of course,” said Dean carelessly. “He's here to-night. I saw him just a minute ago.”

Edith started. Yet she had felt quite sure he would be here.

“Why, no, I haven't—”

A fat man with red hair cut in.

“Hello, Edith,” he began.

“Why—hello there—”

She slipped, stumbled lightly.

“I'm sorry, dear,” she murmured mechanically.

She had seen Gordon—Gordon very white and listless, leaning against the side of a doorway, smoking, and looking into the ballroom. Edith could see that his face was thin and wan—that the hand he raised to his lips with a cigarette, was trembling. They were dancing quite close to him now.

“—They invite so darn many extra fellas that you—”the short man was saying.

“Hello, Gordon,” called Edith over her partner's shoulder. Her heart was pounding wildly.

His large dark eyes were fixed on her. He took a step in her direction. Her partner turned her away—she heard his voice bleating—

“—but half the stags get lit and leave before long, so—”Then a low tone at her side.

“May I, please?”

She was dancing suddenly with Gordon; one of his arms was around her; she felt it tighten spasmodically; felt his hand on her back with the fingers spread. Her hand holding the little lace handkerchief was crushed in his.

“Why Gordon,” she began breathlessly.

“Hello, Edith.”

She slipped again—was tossed forward by her recovery until her face touched the black cloth of his dinner coat. She loved him—she knew she loved him—then for a minute there was silence while a strange feeling of uneasiness crept over her. Something was wrong.

Of a sudden her heart wrenched, and turned over as she realized what it was. He was pitiful and wretched, a little drunk, and miserably tired.

“Oh—”she cried involuntarily.

His eyes looked down at her. She saw suddenly that they were blood-streaked and rolling uncontrollably.

“Gordon,” she murmured, “we'll sit down; I want to sit down.”

They were nearly in mid-floor, but she had seen two men start toward her from opposite sides of the room, so she halted, seized Gordon's limp hand and led him bumping through the crowd, her mouth tight shut, her face a little pale under her rouge, her eyes trembling with tears.

She found a place high up on the soft-carpeted stairs, and he sat down heavily beside her.

“Well,” he began, staring at her unsteadily, “I certainly am glad to see you, Edith.”

She looked at him without answering. The effect of this on her was immeasurable. For years she had seen men in various stages of intoxication, from uncles all the way down to chauffeurs, and her feelings had varied from amusement to disgust, but here for the first time she was seized with a new feeling—an unutterable horror.

“Gordon,” she said accusingly and almost crying, “you look like the devil.”

He nodded, “I've had trouble, Edith.”

“Trouble?”

“All sorts of trouble. Don't you say anything to the family, but I'm all gone to pieces. I'm a mess, Edith.”

His lower lip was sagging. He seemed scarcely to see her.

“Can't you—can't you,” she hesitated, “can't you tell me about it, Gordon? You know I'm always interested in you.”

She bit her lip—she had intended to say something stronger, but found at the end that she couldn't bring it out.

Gordon shook his head dully. “I can't tell you. You're a good woman. I can't tell a good woman the story.”

“Rot,” she said, defiantly. “I think it's a perfect insult to call any one a good woman in that way. It's a slam. You've been drinking, Gordon.”

“Thanks.” He inclined his head gravely. “Thanks for the information.”

“Why do you drink?”

“Because I'm so damn miserable.”

“Do you think drinking's going to make it any better?”

“What you doing—trying to reform me?”

“No; I'm trying to help you, Gordon. Can't you tell me about it?”

“I'm in an awful mess. Best thing you can do is to pretend not to know me.”

“Why, Gordon?”

“I'm sorry I cut in on you—its unfair to you. You're pure woman—and all that sort of thing. Here, I'll get some one else to dance with you.”

He rose clumsily to his feet, but she reached up and pulled him down beside her on the stairs.

“Here, Gordon. You're ridiculous. You're hurting me. You're acting like a—like a crazy man—”

“I admit it. I'm a little crazy. Something's wrong with me, Edith. There's something left me. It doesn't matter.”

“It does, tell me.”

“Just that. I was always queer—little bit different from other boys. All right in college, but now it's all wrong. Things have been snapping inside me for four months like little hooks on a dress, and it's about to come off when a few more hooks go. I'm very gradually going loony.”

He turned his eyes full on her and began to laugh, and she shrank away from him.

“What is the matter?”

“Just me,” he repeated. “I'm going loony. This whole place is like a dream to me—this Delmonico's—”

As he talked she saw he had changed utterly. He wasn't at all light and gay and careless—a great lethargy and discouragement had come over him. Revulsion seized her, followed by a faint, surprising boredom. His voice seemed to come out of a great void.

“Edith,” he said, “I used to think I was clever, talented, an artist. Now I know I'm nothing. Can't draw, Edith. Don't know why I'm telling you this.”

She nodded absently.

“I can't draw, I can't do anything. I'm poor as a church mouse.” Helaughed, bitterly and rather too loud. “I've become a damn beggar, a leech on my friends. I'm a failure. I'm poor as hell.”

Her distaste was growing. She barely nodded this time, waiting for her first possible cue to rise.

Suddenly Gordon's eyes filled with tears.

“Edith,” he said, turning to her with what was evidently a strong effort at self-control, “I can't tell you what it means to me to know there's one person left who's interested in me.”

He reached out and patted her hand, and involuntarily she drew it away.

“It's mighty fine of you,” he repeated.

“Well,” she said slowly, looking him in the eye, “any one's always glad to see an old friend—but I'm sorry to see you like this, Gordon.”

There was a pause while they looked at each other, and the momentary eagerness in his eyes wavered. She rose and stood looking at him, her face quite expressionless.

“Shall we dance?” she suggested, coolly.

—Love is fragile—she was thinking—but perhaps the pieces are saved, the things that hovered on lips, that might have been said. The new love words, the tendernesses learned, are treasured up for the next lover.

Peter Himmel, escort to the lovely Edith, was unaccustomed to being snubbed; having been snubbed, he was hurt and embarrassed, and ashamed of himself. For a matter of two months he had been on special delivery terms with Edith Bradin, and knowing that the one excuse and explanation of the special delivery letter is its value in sentimental correspondence, he had believed himself quite sure of his ground. He searched in vain for any reason why she should have taken this attitude in the matter of a simple kiss.

Therefore when he was cut in on by the man with the mustache he went out into the hall and, making up a sentence, said it over to himself several times. Considerably deleted, this was it:

“Well, if any girl ever led a man on and then jolted him, she did—and she has no kick coming if I go out and get beautifully boiled.”

So he walked through the supper room into a small room adjoining it, which he had located earlier in the evening. It was a room in which there were several large bowls of punch flanked by many bottles. He took a seat beside the table which held the bottles.

At the second highball, boredom, disgust, the monotony of time, the turbidity of events, sank into a vague background before which glittering cobwebs formed. Things became reconciled to themselves, things lay quietly on their shelves; the troubles of the day arranged themselves in trim formation and at his curt wish of dismissal, marched off and disappeared. And with the departure of worry came brilliant, permeating symbolism. Edith became a flighty, negligible girl, not to be worried over; rather to be laughed at. She fitted like a figure of his own dream into the surface world forming about him. He himself became in a measure symbolic, a type of the continent bacchanal, the brilliant dreamer at play.

Then the symbolic mood faded and as he sipped his third highball his imagination yielded to the warm glow and he lapsed into a state similar to floating on his back in pleasant water. It was at this point that he noticed that a green baize door near him was open about two inches, and that through the aperture a pair of eyes were watching him intently.

“Hm,” murmured Peter calmly.

The green door closed—and then opened again—a bare half inch this time.

“Peek-a-boo,” murmured Peter.

The door remained stationary and then he became aware of a series of tense intermittent whispers.

“One guy.”

“What's he doin'?”

“He's sittin' lookin'.”

“He better beat it off. We gotta get another li'l' bottle.”

Peter listened while the words filtered into his consciousness.

“Now this,” he thought, “is most remarkable.”

He was excited. He was jubilant. He felt that he had stumbled upon a mystery. Affecting an elaborate carelessness he arose and waited around the table—then, turning quickly, pulled open the green door, precipitating Private Rose into the room.

Peter bowed.

“How do you do?” he said.

Private Rose set one foot slightly in front of the other, poised for fight, flight, or compromise.

“How do you do?” repeated Peter politely.

“I'm o'right.”

“Can I offer you a drink?”

Private Rose looked at him searchingly, suspecting possible sarcasm.

“O'right,” he said finally.

Peter indicated a chair.

“Sit down.”

“I got a friend,” said Rose, “I got a friend in there.” He pointed to the green door.

“By all means let's have him in.”

Peter crossed over, opened the door and welcomed in Private Key, very suspicious and uncertain and guilty. Chairs were found and the three took their seats around the punch bowl. Peter gave them each a highball and offered them a cigarette from his case. They accepted both with some diffidence.

“Now,” continued Peter easily, “may I ask why you gentlemen prefer to lounge away your leisure hours in a room which is chiefly furnished, as far as I can see, with scrubbing brushes. And when the human race has progressed to the stage where seventeen thousand chairs are manufactured on every day except Sunday—”he paused. Rose and Key regarded him vacantly. “Will you tell me,” went on Peter, “why you choose to rest yourselves on articles, intended for the transportation of water from one place to another?”

At this point Rose contributed a grunt to the conversation.

“And lastly,” finished Peter, “will you tell me why, when you are in a building beautifully hung with enormous candelabra, you prefer to spend these evening hours under one anemic electric light?”

Rose looked at Key; Key looked at Rose. They laughed; they laughed uproariously; they found it was impossible to look at each other without laughing. But they were not laughing with this man—they were laughing at him. To them a man who talked after this fashion was either raving drunk or raving crazy.

“You are Yale men, I presume,” said Peter, finishing his highball and preparing another.

They laughed again.

“Na-ah.”

“So? I thought perhaps you might be members of that lowly section of the university known as the Sheffield Scientific School.”

“Na-ah.”

“Hm. Well, that's too bad. No doubt you are Harvard men, anxious to preserve your incognito in this—this paradise of violet blue, as the newspapers say.”

“Na-ah,” said Key scornfully, “we was just waitin' for somebody.”

“Ah,” exclaimed Peter, rising and filling their glasses, “very interestin'. Had a date with a scrublady, eh?”

They both denied this indignantly.

“It's all right,” Peter reassured them, “don't apologize. A scrublady's as good as any lady in the world.” Kipling says ‘Any lady and Judy O'Grady under the skin.’”

“Sure,” said Key, winking broadly at Rose.

“My case, for instance,” continued Peter, finishing his glass. “I got a girl up here that's spoiled. Spoildest darn girl I ever saw. Refused to kiss me; no reason whatsoever. Led me on deliberately to think sure I want to kiss you and then plunk! Threw me over! What's the younger generation comin' to?”

“Say tha's hard luck,” said Key—“that's awful hard luck.”

“Oh, boy!” said Rose.

“Have another?” said Peter.

“We got in a sort of fight for a while,” said Key after a pause, “but it was too far away.”

“A fight?—tha's stuff!” said Peter, seating himself unsteadily. “Fight 'em all! I was in the army.”

“This was with a Bolshevik fella.”

“Tha's stuff!” exclaimed Peter, enthusiastic. “That's, what I say! Kill the Bolshevik! Exterminate 'em!”

“We're Americuns,” said Rose, implying a sturdy, defiant patriotism.

“Sure,” said Peter. “Greatest race in the world! We're all Americans! Have another.”

They had another.





VI


At one o'clock a special orchestra, special even in a day of special orchestras, arrived at Delmonico's, and its members, seating themselves arrogantly around the piano, took up the burden of providing music for the Gamma Psi Fraternity. They were headed by a famous flute-player, distinguished throughout New York for his feat of standing on his head and shimmying with his shoulders while he played the latest jazz on his flute. During his performance the lights were extinguished except for the spotlight on the flute-player and another roving beam that threw flickering shadows and changing kaleidoscopic colors over the massed dancers.

Edith had danced herself into that tired, dreamy state habitual only with débutantes, a state equivalent to the glow of a noble soul after several long highballs. Her mind floated vaguely on the bosom of her music; her partners changed with the unreality of phantoms under the colorful shifting dusk, and to her present coma it seemed as if days had passed since the dance began. She had talked on many fragmentary subjects with many men. She had been kissed once and made love to six times. Earlier in the evening different under-graduates had danced with her, but now, like all the more popular girls there, she had her own entourage—that is, half a dozen gallants had singled her out or were alternating her charms with those of some other chosen beauty; they cut in on her in regular, inevitable succession.

Several times she had seen Gordon—he had been sitting a long time on the stairway with his palm to his head, his dull eyes fixed at an infinite spark on the floor before him, very depressed, he looked, and quite drunk—but Edith each time had averted her glance hurriedly. All that seemed long ago; her mind was passive now, her senses were lulled to trance-like sleep; only her feet danced and her voice talked on in hazy sentimental banter.

But Edith was not nearly so tired as to be incapable of moral indignation when Peter Himmel cut in on her, sublimely and happily drunk. She gasped and looked up at him.

“Why, Peter!”

“I'm a li'l' stewed, Edith.”

“Why, Peter, you're a peach, you are! Don't you think it's a bum way of doing—when you're with me?”

Then she smiled unwillingly, for he was looking at her with owlish sentimentality varied with a silly spasmodic smile.

“Darlin' Edith,” he began earnestly, “you know I love you, don't you?”

“You tell it well.”

“I love you—and I merely wanted you to kiss me,” he added sadly.

His embarrassment, his shame, were both gone. She was a mos' beautiful girl in whole worl'. Mos' beautiful eyes, like stars above. He wanted to ‘pologize—firs’, for presuming try to kiss her; second, for drinking—but he'd been so discouraged 'cause he had thought she was mad at him—

The red-fat man cut in, and looking up at Edith smiled radiantly.

“Did you bring any one?” she asked.

No. The red-fat man was a stag.

“Well, would you mind—would it be an awful bother for you to—to take me home to-night?” (This extreme diffidence was a charming affectation on Edith's part—she knew that the red-fat man would immediately dissolve into a paroxysm of delight).

“Bother? Why, good Lord, I'd be darn glad to! You know I'd be darn glad to.”

“Thanks loads! You're awfully sweet.”

She glanced at her wrist watch. It was half-past one. And, as she said“half-past one”to herself, it floated vaguely into her mind that her brother had told her at luncheon that he worked in the office of his newspaper until after one-thirty every evening.

Edith turned suddenly to her current partner.

“What street is Delmonico's on, anyway?”

“Street? Oh, why Fifth Avenue, of course.”

“I mean, what cross street?”

“Why—let's see—it's on Forty-fourth Street.”

This verified what she had thought. Henry's office must be across the street and just around the corner, and it occurred to her immediately that she might slip over for a moment and surprise him, float in on him, a shimmering marvel in her new crimson opera cloak and“cheer him up.” It was exactly the sort of thing Edith revelled in doing—an unconventional, jaunty thing. The idea reached out and gripped at her imagination—after an instant's hesitation she had decided.

“My hair is just about to tumble entirely down,” she said pleasantly to her partner; “would you mind if I go and fix it?”

“Not at all.”

“You're a peach.”

A few minutes later, wrapped in her crimson opera cloak, she flitted down a side-stairs, her cheeks glowing with excitement at her little adventure. She ran by a couple who stood at the door—a weak-chinned waiter and an over-rouged young lady, in hot dispute—and opening the outer door stepped into the warm May night.





VII


The over-rouged young lady followed her with a brief, bitter glance—then turned again to the weak-chinned waiter and took up her argument.

“You better go up and tell him I'm here,” she said defiantly, “or I'll go up myself.”

“No, you don't!” said George sternly.

The girl smiled sardonically.

“Oh, I don't, don't I? Well, let me tell you I know more college fellas and more of 'em know me, and are glad to take me out on a party, than you ever saw in your whole life.”

“Maybe so—”

“Maybe so,” she interrupted. “Oh, it's all right for any of 'em like that one that just ran out—God knows where she went—it's all right for them that are asked here to come or go as they like—but when I want to see a friend they have some cheap, ham-slinging, bring-me-a-doughnut waiter to stand here and keep me out.”

“See here,” said the elder Key indignantly, “I can't lose my job. Maybe this fella you're talkin' about doesn't want to see you.”

“Oh, he wants to see me all right.”

“Anyways, how could I find him in all that crowd?”

“Oh, he'll be there,” she asserted confidently. “You just ask anybody for Gordon Sterrett and they'll point him out to you. They all know each other, those fellas.”

She produced a mesh bag, and taking out a dollar bill handed it to George.

“Here,” she said, “here's a bribe. You find him and give him my message. You tell him if he isn't here in five minutes I'm coming up.”

George shook his head pessimistically, considered the question for a moment, wavered violently, and then withdrew.

In less than the allotted time Gordon came down-stairs. He was drunker than he had been earlier in the evening and in a different way. The liquor seemed to have hardened on him like a crust. He was heavy and lurching—almost incoherent when he talked.

“'Lo, Jewel,” he said thickly. “Came right away, Jewel, I couldn't get that money. Tried my best.”

“Money nothing!” she snapped. “You haven't been near me for ten days. What's the matter?”

He shook his head slowly.

“Been very low, Jewel. Been sick.”

“Why didn't you tell me if you were sick. I don't care about the money that bad. I didn't start bothering you about it at all until you began neglecting me.”

Again he shook his head.

“Haven't been neglecting you. Not at all.”

“Haven't! You haven't been near me for three weeks, unless you been so drunk you didn't know what you were doing.”

“Been sick. Jewel,” he repeated, turning his eyes upon her wearily.

“You're well enough to come and play with your society friends here all right. You told me you'd meet me for dinner, and you said you'd have some money for me. You didn't even bother to ring me up.”

“I couldn't get any money.”

“Haven't I just been saying that doesn't matter? I wanted to see you, Gordon, but you seem to prefer your somebody else.”

He denied this bitterly.

“Then get your hat and come along,” she suggested. Gordon hesitated—and she came suddenly close to him and slipped her arms around his neck.

“Come on with me, Gordon,” she said in a half whisper. “We'll go over to Devineries' and have a drink, and then we can go up to my apartment.”

“I can't, Jewel—”

“You can,” she said intensely.

“I'm sick as a dog!”

“Well, then, you oughtn't to stay here and dance.”

With a glance around him in which relief and despair were mingled, Gordon hesitated; then she suddenly pulled him to her and kissed him with soft, pulpy lips.

“All right,” he said heavily. “I'll get my hat.”





VIII


When Edith came out into the clear blue of the May night she found the Avenue deserted. The windows of the big shops were dark; over their doors were drawn great iron masks until they were only shadowy tombs of the late day's splendor. Glancing down toward Forty-second Street shesaw a commingled blur of lights from the all-night restaurants. Over on Sixth Avenue the elevated, a flare of fire, roared across the street between the glimmering parallels of light at the station and streaked along into the crisp dark. But at Forty-fourth Street it was very quiet.

Pulling her cloak close about her Edith darted across the Avenue. She started nervously as a solitary man passed her and said in a hoarse whisper—“Where bound, kiddo?” She was reminded of a night in her childhood when she had walked around the block in her pajamas and a dog had howled at her from a mystery-big back yard.

In a minute she had reached her destination, a two-story, comparatively old building on Forty-fourth, in the upper window of which she thankfully detected a wisp of light. It was bright enough outside for her to make out the sign beside the window—the New York Trumpet. She stepped inside a dark hall and after a second saw the stairs in the corner.

Then she was in a long, low room furnished with many desks and hung on all sides with file copies of newspapers. There were only two occupants. They were sitting at different ends of the room, each wearing a green eye-shade and writing by a solitary desk light.

For a moment she stood uncertainly in the doorway, and then both men turned around simultaneously and she recognized her brother.

“Why, Edith!” He rose quickly and approached her in surprise, removing his eye-shade. He was tall, lean, and dark, with black, piercing eyes under very thick glasses. They were far-away eyes that seemed always fixed just over the head of the person to whom he was talking.

He put his hands on her arms and kissed her cheek.

“What is it?” he repeated in some alarm.

“I was at a dance across at Delmonico's, Henry,” she said excitedly, “and I couldn't resist tearing over to see you.”

“I'm glad you did.” His alertness gave way quickly to a habitual vagueness. “You oughtn't to be out alone at night though, ought you?”

The man at the other end of the room had been looking at them curiously, but at Henry's beckoning gesture he approached. He was loosely fat with little twinkling eyes, and, having removed his collar and tie, he gave the impression of a Middle-Western farmer on a Sunday afternoon.

“This is my sister,” said Henry. “She dropped in to see me.”

“How do you do?” said the fat man, smiling. “My name's Bartholomew, Miss Bradin. I know your brother has forgotten it long ago.”

Edith laughed politely.

“Well,” he continued, “not exactly gorgeous quarters we have here, are they?”

Edith looked around the room.

“They seem very nice,” she replied. “Where do you keep the bombs?”

“The bombs?” repeated Bartholomew, laughing. “That's pretty good—the bombs. Did you hear her, Henry? She wants to know where we keep the bombs. Say, that's pretty good.”

Edith swung herself onto a vacant desk and sat dangling her feet over the edge. Her brother took a seat beside her.

“Well,” he asked, absent-mindedly, “how do you like New York this trip?”

“Not bad. I'll be over at the Biltmore with the Hoyts until Sunday. Can't you come to luncheon to-morrow?”

He thought a moment.

“I'm especially busy,” he objected, “and I hate women in groups.”

“All right,” she agreed, unruffled. “Let's you and me have luncheon together.”

“Very well.”

“I'll call for you at twelve.”

Bartholomew was obviously anxious to return to his desk, but apparently considered that it would be rude to leave without some parting pleasantry.

“Well”—he began awkwardly.

They both turned to him.

“Well, we—we had an exciting time earlier in the evening.”

The two men exchanged glances.

“You should have come earlier,” continued Bartholomew, somewhat encouraged. “We had a regular vaudeville.”

“Did you really?”

“A serenade,” said Henry. “A lot of soldiers gathered down there in the street and began to yell at the sign.”

“Why?” she demanded.

“Just a crowd,” said Henry, abstractedly. “All crowds have to howl. They didn't have anybody with much initiative in the lead, or they'd probably have forced their way in here and smashed things up.”

“Yes,” said Bartholomew, turning again to Edith, “you should have been here.”

He seemed to consider this a sufficient cue for withdrawal, for he turned abruptly and went back to his desk.

“Are the soldiers all set against the Socialists?” demanded Edith of her brother. “I mean do they attack you violently and all that?”

Henry replaced his eye-shade and yawned.

“The human race has come a long way,” he said casually, “but most of us are throw-backs; the soldiers don't know what they want, or what they hate, or what they like. They're used to acting in large bodies, and they seem to have to make demonstrations. So it happens to be against us. There've been riots all over the city to-night. It's May Day, you see.”

“Was the disturbance here pretty serious?”

“Not a bit,” he said scornfully. “About twenty-five of them stopped in the street about nine o'clock, and began to bellow at the moon.”

“Oh”—She changed the subject. “You're glad to see me, Henry?”

“Why, sure.”

“You don't seem to be.”

“I am.”

“I suppose you think I'm a—a waster. Sort of the World's Worst Butterfly.”

Henry laughed.

“Not at all. Have a good time while you're young. Why? Do I seem like the priggish and earnest youth?”

“No—”she paused, “—but somehow I began thinking how absolutely different the party I'm on is from—from all your purposes. It seems sort of—of incongruous, doesn't it?—me being at a party like that, and you over here working for a thing that'll make that sort of party impossible ever any more, if your ideas work.”

“I don't think of it that way. You're young, and you're acting just as you were brought up to act. Go ahead—have a good time?”

Her feet, which had been idly swinging, stopped and her voice dropped a note.

“I wish you'd—you'd come back to Harrisburg and have a good time. Do you feel sure that you're on the right track—”

“You're wearing beautiful stockings,” he interrupted. “What on earth are they?”

“They're embroidered,” she replied, glancing down. “Aren't they cunning?” She raised her skirts and uncovered slim, silk-sheathed calves. “Or do you disapprove of silk stockings?”

He seemed slightly exasperated, bent his dark eyes on her piercingly.

“Are you trying to make me out as criticizing you in any way, Edith?”

“Not at all—”

She paused. Bartholomew had uttered a grunt. She turned and saw that he had left his desk and was standing at the window.

“What is it?” demanded Henry.

“People,” said Bartholomew, and then after an instant: “Whole jam of them. They're coming from Sixth Avenue.”

“People?”

The fat man pressed his nose to the pane.

“Soldiers, by God!” he said emphatically. “I had an idea they'd come back.”

Edith jumped to her feet, and running over joined Bartholomew at the window.

“There's a lot of them!” she cried excitedly. “Come here, Henry!”

Henry readjusted his shade, but kept his seat.

“Hadn't we better turn out the lights?” suggested Bartholomew.

“No. They'll go away in a minute.”

“They're not,” said Edith, peering from the window. “They're not even thinking of going away. There's more of them coming. Look—there's a whole crowd turning the corner of Sixth Avenue.”

By the yellow glow and blue shadows of the street lamp she could see that the sidewalk was crowded with men. They were mostly in uniform, some sober, some enthusiastically drunk, and over the whole swept an incoherent clamor and shouting.

Henry rose, and going to the window exposed himself as a long silhouette against the office lights. Immediately the shouting became a steady yell, and a rattling fusillade of small missiles, corners of tobacco plugs, cigarette-boxes, and even pennies beat against the window. The sounds of the racket now began floating up the stairs as the folding doors revolved.

“They're coming up!” cried Bartholomew.

Edith turned anxiously to Henry.

“They're coming up, Henry.”

From down-stairs in the lower hall their cries were now quite audible.

“—God Damn Socialists!”

“Pro-Germans! Boche-lovers!”

“Second floor, front! Come on!”

“We'll get the sons—”

The next five minutes passed in a dream. Edith was conscious that the clamor burst suddenly upon the three of them like a cloud of rain, that there was a thunder of many feet on the stairs, that Henry had seized her arm and drawn her back toward the rear of the office. Then the door opened and an overflow of men were forced into the room—not the leaders, but simply those who happened to be in front.

“Hello, Bo!”

“Up late, ain't you!”

“You an' your girl. Damn you!”

She noticed that two very drunken soldiers had been forced to the front, where they wobbled fatuously—one of them was short and dark, the other was tall and weak of chin.

Henry stepped forward and raised his hand.

“Friends!” he said.

The clamor faded into a momentary stillness, punctuated with mutterings.

“Friends!” he repeated, his far-away eyes fixed over the heads of the crowd, “you're injuring no one but yourselves by breaking in here to-night. Do we look like rich men? Do we look like Germans? I ask you in all fairness—”

“Pipe down!”

“I'll say you do!”

“Say, who's your lady friend, buddy?”

A man in civilian clothes, who had been pawing over a table, suddenly held up a newspaper.

“Here it is!” he shouted. “They wanted the Germans to win the war!”

A new overflow from the stairs was shouldered in and of a sudden the room was full of men all closing around the pale little group at the back. Edith saw that the tall soldier with the weak chin was still in front. The short dark one had disappeared.

She edged slightly backward, stood close to the open window, through which came a clear breath of cool night air.

Then the room was a riot. She realized that the soldiers were surging forward, glimpsed the fat man swinging a chair over his head—instantly the lights went out and she felt the push of warm bodies under rough cloth, and her ears were full of shouting and trampling and hard breathing.

A figure flashed by her out of nowhere, tottered, was edged sideways, and of a sudden disappeared helplessly out through the open window with a frightened, fragmentary cry that died staccato on the bosom of the clamor. By the faint light streaming from the building backing on the area Edith had a quick impression that it had been the tall soldier with the weak chin.

Anger rose astonishingly in her. She swung her arms wildly, edged blindly toward the thickest of the scuffling. She heard grunts, curses, the muffled impact of fists.

“Henry!” she called frantically, “Henry!”

Then, it was minutes later, she felt suddenly that there were other figures in the room. She heard a voice, deep, bullying, authoritative; she saw yellow rays of light sweeping here and there in the fracas. The cries became more scattered. The scuffling increased and then stopped.

Suddenly the lights were on and the room was full of policemen, clubbing left and right. The deep voice boomed out:

“Here now! Here now! Here now!”

And then:

“Quiet down and get out! Here now!”

The room seemed to empty like a wash-bowl. A policeman fast-grappled in the corner released his hold on his soldier antagonist and started him with a shove toward the door. The deep voice continued. Edith perceived now that it came from a bull-necked police captain standing near the door.

“Here now! This is no way! One of your own sojers got shoved out of the back window an' killed hisself!”

“Henry!” called Edith, “Henry!”

She beat wildly with her fists on the back of the man in front of her; she brushed between two others; fought, shrieked, and beat her way to a very pale figure sitting on the floor close to a desk.

“Henry,” she cried passionately, “what's the matter? What's the matter? Did they hurt you?”

His eyes were shut. He groaned and then looking up said disgustedly—

“They broke my leg. My God, the fools!”

“Here now!” called the police captain. “Here now! Here now!”





IX


“Childs', Fifty-ninth Street,” at eight o'clock of any morning differs from its sisters by less than the width of their marble tables or the degree of polish on the frying-pans. You will see there a crowd of poor people with sleep in the corners of their eyes, trying to look straight before them at their food so as not to see the other poor people. But Childs', Fifty-ninth, four hours earlier is quite unlike any Childs' restaurant from Portland, Oregon, to Portland, Maine. Within its pale but sanitary walls one finds a noisy medley of chorus girls, college boys, débutantes, rakes, filles de joie—a not unrepresentative mixture of the gayest of Broadway, and even of Fifth Avenue.

In the early morning of May the second it was unusually full. Over the marble-topped tables were bent the excited faces of flappers whose fathers owned individual villages. They were eating buckwheat cakes and scrambled eggs with relish and gusto, an accomplishment that it would have been utterly impossible for them to repeat in the same place four hours later.

Almost the entire crowd were from the Gamma Psi dance at Delmonico's except for several chorus girls from a midnight revue who sat at a side table and wished they'd taken off a little more make-up after the show. Here and there a drab, mouse-like figure, desperately out of place, watched the butte flies with a weary, puzzled curiosity. But the drab figure was the exception. This was the morning after May Day, and celebration was still in the air.

Gus Rose, sober but a little dazed, must be classed as one of the drab figures. How he had got himself from Forty-fourth Street to Fifty-ninth Street after the riot was only a hazy half-memory. He had seen the body of Carrol Key put in an ambulance and driven off, and then he had started up town with two or three soldiers. Somewhere between Forty-fourth Street and Fifty-ninth Street the other soldiers had met some women and disappeared. Rose had wandered to Columbus Circle and chosen the gleaming lights of Childs' to minister to his craving for coffee and doughnuts. He walked in and sat down.

All around him floated airy, inconsequential chatter and high-pitched laughter. At first he failed to understand, but after a puzzled five minutes he realized that this was the aftermath of some gay party. Here and there a restless, hilarious young man wandered fraternally and familiarly between the tables, shaking hands indiscriminately and pausing occasionally for a facetious chat, while excited waiters, bearing cakes and eggs aloft, swore at him silently, and bumped him out of the way. To Rose, seated at the most inconspicuous and least crowded table, the whole scene was a colorful circus of beauty and riotous pleasure.

He became gradually aware, after a few moments, that the couple seated diagonally across from him with their backs to the crowd, were not the least interesting pair in the room. The man was drunk. He wore a dinner coat with a dishevelled tie and shirt swollen by spillings of water and wine. His eyes, dim and blood-shot, roved unnaturally from side to side. His breath came short between his lips.

“He's been on a spree!” thought Rose.

The woman was almost if not quite sober. She was pretty, with dark eyes and feverish high color, and she kept her active eyes fixed on her companion with the alertness of a hawk. From time to time she would lean and whisper intently to him, and he would answer by inclining his head heavily or by a particularly ghoulish and repellent wink.

Rose scrutinized them dumbly for some minutes until the woman gave him a quick, resentful look; then he shifted his gaze to two of the most conspicuously hilarious of the promenaders who were on a protracted circuit of the tables. To his surprise he recognized in one of them the young man by whom he had been so ludicrously entertained at Delmonico's. This started him thinking of Key with a vague sentimentality, not unmixed with awe. Key was dead. He had fallen thirty-five feet and split his skull like a cracked cocoanut.

“He was a darn good guy,” thought Rose mournfully. “He was a darn good guy, o'right. That was awful hard luck about him.”

The two promenaders approached and started down between Rose's table and the next, addressing friends and strangers alike with jovial familiarity. Suddenly Rose saw the fair-haired one with the prominent teeth stop, look unsteadily at the man and girl opposite, and then begin to move his head disapprovingly from side to side.

The man with the blood-shot eyes looked up.

“Gordy,” said the promenader with the prominent teeth, “Gordy.”

“Hello,” said the man with the stained shirt thickly.

Prominent teeth shook his finger pessimistically at the pair, giving the woman a glance of aloof condemnation.

“What'd I tell you Gordy?”

Gordon stirred in his seat.

“Go to hell!” he said.

Dean continued to stand there shaking his finger. The woman began to get angry,

“You go way!” she cried fiercely. “You're drunk, that's what you are!”

“So's he,” suggested Dean, staying the motion of his finger and pointing it at Gordon.

Peter Himmel ambled up, owlish now and oratorically inclined.

“Here now,” he began as if called upon to deal with some petty dispute between children. “Wha's all trouble?”

“You take your friend away,” said Jewel tartly. “He's bothering us.”

“What's 'at?”

“You heard me!” she said shrilly. “I said to take your drunken friend away.”

Her rising voice rang out above the clatter of the restaurant and a waiter came hurrying up.

“You gotta be more quiet!”

“That fella's drunk,” she cried. “He's insulting us.”

“Ah-ha, Gordy,” persisted the accused. “What'd I tell you.” He turned to the waiter. “Gordy an' I friends. Been tryin' help him, haven't I, Gordy?”

Gordy looked up.

“Help me? Hell, no!”

Jewel rose suddenly, and seizing Gordon's arm assisted him to his feet.

“Come on, Gordy!” she said, leaning toward him and speaking in a half whisper. “Let's us get out of here. This fella's got a mean drunk on.”

Gordon allowed himself to be urged to his feet and started toward the door. Jewel turned for a second and addressed the provoker of their flight.

“I know all about you!” she said fiercely. “Nice friend, you are, I'll say. He told me about you.”

Then she seized Gordon's arm, and together they made their way through the curious crowd, paid their check, and went out.

“You'll have to sit down,” said the waiter to Peter after they had gone.

“What's 'at? Sit down?”

“Yes—or get out.”

Peter turned to Dean.

“Come on,” he suggested. “Let's beat up this waiter.”

“All right.”

They advanced toward him, their faces grown stern. The waiter retreated.

Peter suddenly reached over to a plate on the table beside him and picking up a handful of hash tossed it into the air. It descended as a languid parabola in snowflake effect on the heads of those near by.

“Hey! Ease up!”

“Put him out!”

“Sit down, Peter!”

“Cut out that stuff!”

Peter laughed and bowed.

“Thank you for your kind applause, ladies and gents. If some one will lend me some more hash and a tall hat we will go on with the act.”

The bouncer bustled up.

“You've gotta get out!” he said to Peter.

“Hell, no!”

“He's my friend!” put in Dean indignantly.

A crowd of waiters were gathering. “Put him out!”

“Better go, Peter.”

There was a short struggle and the two were edged and pushed toward the door.

“I got a hat and a coat here!” cried Peter.

“Well, go get 'em and be spry about it!”

The bouncer released his hold on Peter, who, adopting a ludicrous air of extreme cunning, rushed immediately around to the other table, where he burst into derisive laughter and thumbed his nose at the exasperated waiters.

“Think I just better wait a l'il' longer,” he announced.

The chase began. Four waiters were sent around one way and four another. Dean caught hold of two of them by the coat, and another struggle took place before the pursuit of Peter could be resumed; he was finally pinioned after overturning a sugar-bowl and several cups of coffee. A fresh argument ensued at the cashier's desk, where Peter attempted to buy another dish of hash to take with him and throw at policemen.

But the commotion upon his exit proper was dwarfed by another phenomenon which drew admiring glances and a prolonged involuntary“Oh-h-h!” from every person in the restaurant.

The great plate-glass front had turned to a deep blue, the color of a Max field Parrish moonlight—a blue that seemed to press close upon the pane as if to crowd its way into the restaurant. Dawn had come up in Columbus Circle, magical, breathless dawn, silhouetting the great statue of the immortal Christopher, and mingling in a curious and uncanny manner with the fading yellow electric light inside.

Mr. In and Mr. Out are not listed by the census-taker. You will search for them in vain through the social register or the births, marriages, and deaths, or the grocer's credit list. Oblivion has swallowed them and the testimony that they ever existed at all is vague and shadowy, and inadmissible in a court of law. Yet I have it upon the best authority that for a brief space Mr. In and Mr. Out lived, breathed, answered to their names and radiated vivid personalities of their own.

During the brief span of their lives they walked in their native garments down the great highway of a great nation; were laughed at, sworn at, chased, and fled from. Then they passed and were heard of no more.

They were already taking form dimly, when a taxi cab with the top open breezed down Broadway in the faintest glimmer of May dawn. In this car sat the souls of Mr. In and Mr. Out discussing with amazement the blue light that had so precipitately colored the sky behind the statue of Christopher Columbus, discussing with bewilderment the old, gray faces of the early risers which skimmed palely along the street like blown bits of paper on a gray lake. They were agreed on all things, from the absurdity of the bouncer in Childs' to the absurdity of the business of life. They were dizzy with the extreme maudlin happiness that the morning had awakened in their glowing souls. Indeed, so fresh and vigorous was their pleasure in living that they felt it should be expressed by loud cries.

“Ye-ow-ow!” hooted Peter, making a megaphone with his hands—and Dean joined in with a call that, though equally significant and symbolic, derived its resonance from its very inarticulateness.

“Yo-ho! Yea! Yoho! Yo-buba!”

Fifty-third Street was a bus with a dark, bobbed-hair beauty atop; Fifty-second was a street cleaner who dodged, escaped, and sent up a yell of, “Look where you're aimin'!” in a pained and grieved voice. At Fiftieth Street a group of men on a very white sidewalk in front of a very white building turned to stare after them, and shouted:

“Some party, boys!”

At Forty-ninth Street Peter turned to Dean. “Beautiful morning,” he said gravely, squinting up his owlish eyes.

“Probably is.”

“Go get some breakfast, hey?”

Dean agreed—with additions.

“Breakfast and liquor.”

“Breakfast and liquor,” repeated Peter, and they looked at each other, nodding. “That's logical,”

Then they both burst into loud laughter.

“Breakfast and liquor! Oh, gosh!”

“No such thing,” announced Peter.

“Don't serve it? Ne'mind. We force 'em serve it. Bring pressure bear.”

“Bring logic bear.”

The taxi cut suddenly off Broadway, sailed along a cross street, and stopped in front of a heavy tomb-like building in Fifth Avenue.

“What's idea?”

The taxi-driver informed them that this was Delmonico's.

This was somewhat puzzling. They were forced to devote several minutes to intense concentration, for if such an order had been given there must have been a reason for it.

“Somep'm 'bouta coat,” suggested the taxi-man.

That was it. Peter's overcoat and hat. He had left them at Delmonico's. Having decided this, they disembarked from the taxi and strolled toward the entrance arm in arm.

“Hey!” said the taxi-driver.

“Huh?”

“You better pay me.”

They shook their heads in shocked negation.

“Later, not now—we give orders, you wait.”

The taxi-driver objected; he wanted his money now. With the scornful condescension of men exercising tremendous self-control they paid him.

Inside Peter groped in vain through a dim, deserted check-room in search of his coat and derby.

“Gone, I guess. Somebody stole it.”

“Some Sheff student.”

“All probability.”

“Never mind,” said Dean, nobly. “I'll leave mine here too—then we'll both be dressed the same.”

He removed his overcoat and hat and was hanging them up when his roving glance was caught and held magnetically by two large squares of cardboard tacked to the two coat-room doors. The one on the left-hand door bore the word“In”in big black letters, and the one on the right-hand door flaunted the equally emphatic word“Out.”

“Look!” he exclaimed happily—

Peter's eyes followed his pointing finger.

“What?”

“Look at the signs. Let's take 'em.”

“Good idea.”

“Probably pair very rare an' valuable signs. Probably come in handy.”

Peter removed the left-hand sign from the door and endeavored to conceal it about his person. The sign being of considerable proportions, this was a matter of some difficulty. An idea flung itself at him, and with an air of dignified mystery he turned his back. After an instant he wheeled dramatically around, and stretching out his arms displayed himself to the admiring Dean. He had inserted the sign in his vest, completely covering his shirt front. In effect, the word“In”had been painted upon his shirt in large black letters.

“Yoho!” cheered Dean. “Mister In.”

He inserted his own sign in like manner.

“Mister Out!” he announced triumphantly. “Mr. In meet Mr. Out.”

They advanced and shook hands. Again laughter overcame them and they rocked in a shaken spasm of mirth.

“Yoho!”

“We probably get a flock of breakfast.”

“We'll go—go to the Commodore.”

Arm in arm they sallied out the door, and turning east in Forty-fourth Street set out for the Commodore.

As they came out a short dark soldier, very pale and tired, who had been wandering listlessly along the sidewalk, turned to look at them.

He started over as though to address them, but as they immediately bent on him glances of withering unrecognition, he waited until they had started unsteadily down the street, and then followed at about forty paces, chuckling to himself and saying, “Oh, boy!” over and over under his breath, in delighted, anticipatory tones.

Mr. In and Mr. Out were meanwhile exchanging pleasantries concerning their future plans.

“We want liquor; we want breakfast. Neither without the other. One and indivisible.”

“We want both 'em!”

“Both 'em!”

It was quite light now, and passers-by began to bend curious eyes on the pair. Obviously they were engaged in a discussion, which afforded each of them intense amusement, for occasionally a fit of laughter would seize upon them so violently that, still with their arms interlocked, they would bend nearly double.

Reaching the Commodore, they exchanged a few spicy epigrams with the sleepy-eyed doorman, navigated the revolving door with some difficulty, and then made their way through a thinly populated but startled lobby to the dining-room, where a puzzled waiter showed them an obscure table in a corner. They studied the bill of fare helplessly, telling over the items to each other in puzzled mumbles.

“Don't see any liquor here,” said Peter reproachfully.

The waiter became audible but unintelligible.

“Repeat,” continued Peter, with patient tolerance, “that there seems to be unexplained and quite distasteful lack of liquor upon bill of fare.”

“Here!” said Dean confidently, “let me handle him.” He turned to the waiter—“Bring us—bring us—”he scanned the bill of fare anxiously. “Bring us a quart of champagne and a—a—probably ham sandwich.”

The waiter looked doubtful.

“Bring it!” roared Mr. In and Mr. Out in chorus.

The waiter coughed and disappeared. There was a short wait during which they were subjected without their knowledge to a careful scrutiny by the head-waiter. Then the champagne arrived, and at the sight of it Mr. In and Mr. Out became jubilant.

“Imagine their objecting to us having, champagne for breakfast—jus' imagine.”

They both concentrated upon the vision of such an awesome possibility, but the feat was too much for them. It was impossible for their joint imaginations to conjure up a world where any one might object any one else having champagne for breakfast. The waiter drew the cork with an enormous pop—and their glasses immediately foamed with pale yellow froth.

“Here's health, Mr. In.”

“Here's same to you, Mr. Out.”

The waiter withdrew; the minutes passed; the champagne became low in the bottle.

“It's—it's mortifying,” said Dean suddenly.

“Wha's mortifying?”

“The idea their objecting us having champagne breakfast.”

“Mortifying?” Peter considered. “Yes, tha's word—mortifying.”

Again they collapsed into laughter, howled, swayed, rocked back and forth in their chairs, repeating the word“mortifying”over and over to each other—each repetition seeming to make it only more brilliantly absurd.

After a few more gorgeous minutes they decided on another quart. Their anxious waiter consulted his immediate superior, and this discreet person gave implicit instructions that no more champagne should be served. Their check was brought.

Five minutes later, arm in arm, they left the Commodore and made their way through a curious, staring crowd along Forty-second Street, and up Vanderbilt Avenue to the Biltmore. There, with sudden cunning, they rose to the occasion and traversed the lobby, walking fast and standing unnaturally erect.

Once in the dining-room they repeated their performance. They were torn between intermittent convulsive laughter and sudden spasmodic discussions of politics, college, and the sunny state of their dispositions. Their watches told them that it was now nine o'clock, and a dim idea was born in them that they were on a memorable party, something that they would remember always. They lingered over the second bottle. Either of them had only to mention the word“mortifying”to send them both into riotous gasps. The dining-room was whirring and shifting now; a curious lightness permeated and rarefied the heavy air.

They paid their check and walked out into the lobby.

It was at this moment that the exterior doors revolved for the thousandth time that morning, and admitted into the lobby a very pale young beauty with dark circles under her eyes, attired in a much-rumpled evening dress. She was accompanied by a plain stout man, obviously not an appropriate escort.

At the top of the stairs this couple encountered Mr. In and Mr. Out.

“Edith,” began Mr. In, stepping toward her hilariously and making a sweeping bow, “darling, good morning.”

The stout man glanced questioningly at Edith, as if merely asking her permission to throw this man summarily out of the way.

“'Scuse familiarity,” added Peter, as an afterthought. “Edith, good-morning.”

He seized Dean's elbow and impelled him into the foreground.

“Meet Mr. In, Edith, my bes'frien'. Inseparable. Mr. In and Mr. Out.”

Mr. Out advanced and bowed; in fact, he advanced so far and bowed so low that he tipped slightly forward and only kept his balance by placing a hand lightly on Edith's shoulder.

“I'm Mr. Out, Edith,” he mumbled pleasantly. “S'misterin Misterout.”

“'Smisterinanout,” said Peter proudly.

But Edith stared straight by them, her eyes fixed on some infinite speck in the gallery above her. She nodded slightly to the stout man, who advanced bull-like and with a sturdy brisk gesture pushed Mr. In and Mr. Out to either side. Through this alley he and Edith walked.

But ten paces farther on Edith stopped again—stopped and pointed to a short, dark soldier who was eying the crowd in general, and the tableau of Mr. In and Mr. Out in particular, with a sort of puzzled, spell-bound awe.

“There,” cried Edith. “See there!”

Her voice rose, became somewhat shrill. Her pointing finger shook slightly.

“There's the soldier who broke my brother's leg.”

There were a dozen exclamations; a man in a cutaway coat left his place near the desk and advanced alertly; the stout person made a sort of lightning-like spring toward the short, dark soldier, and then the lobby closed around the little group and blotted them from the sight of Mr. In and Mr. Out.

But to Mr. In and Mr. Out this event was merely a particolored iridescent segment of a whirring, spinning world.

They heard loud voices; they saw the stout man spring; the picture suddenly blurred.

Then they were in an elevator bound skyward.

“What floor, please?” said the elevator man.

“Any floor,” said Mr. In.

“Top floor,” said Mr. Out.

“This is the top floor,” said the elevator man.

“Have another floor put on,” said Mr. Out.

“Higher,” said Mr. In.

“Heaven,” said Mr. Out.

In a bedroom of a small hotel just off Sixth Avenue Gordon Sterrett awoke with a pain in the back of his head and a sick throbbing in all his veins. He looked at the dusky gray shadows in the corners of the room and at a raw place on a large leather chair in the corner where it had long been in use. He saw clothes, dishevelled, rumpled clothes on the floor and he smelt stale cigarette smoke and stale liquor. The windows were tight shut. Outside the bright sunlight had thrown a dust-filled beam across the sill—a beam broken by the head of the wide wooden bed in which he had slept. He lay very quiet—comatose, drugged, his eyes wide, his mind clicking wildly like an unoiled machine.

It must have been thirty seconds after he perceived the sunbeam with the dust on it and the rip on the large leather chair that he had the sense of life close beside him, and it was another thirty seconds after that before that he realized that he was irrevocably married to Jewel Hudson.

He went out half an hour later and bought a revolver at a sporting goods store. Then he took a took a taxi to the room where he had been living on East Twenty-seventh Street, and, leaning across the table that held his drawing materials, fired a cartridge into his head just behind the temple.





THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON


I


As long ago as 1860 it was the proper thing to be born at home. At present, so I am told, the high gods of medicine have decreed that the first cries of the young shall be uttered upon the anaesthetic air of a hospital, preferably a fashionable one. So young Mr. and Mrs. Roger Button were fifty years ahead of style when they decided, one day in the summer of 1860, that their first baby should be born in a hospital. Whether this anachronism had any bearing upon the astonishing history I am about to set down will never be known.

I shall tell you what occurred, and let you judge for yourself.

The Roger Buttons held an enviable position, both social and financial, in ante-bellum Baltimore. They were related to the This Family and the That Family, which, as every Southerner knew, entitled them to membership in that enormous peerage which largely populated the Confederacy. This was their first experience with the charming old custom of having babies—Mr. Button was naturally nervous. He hoped it would be a boy so that he could be sent to Yale College in Connecticut, at which institution Mr. Button himself had been known for four years by the somewhat obvious nickname of“Cuff.”

On the September morning consecrated to the enormous event he arose nervously at six o'clock dressed himself, adjusted an impeccable stock, and hurried forth through the streets of Baltimore to the hospital, to determine whether the darkness of the night had borne in new life upon its bosom.

When he was approximately a hundred yards from the Maryland Private Hospital for Ladies and Gentlemen he saw Doctor Keene, the family physician, descending the front steps, rubbing his hands together with a washing movement—as all doctors are required to do by the unwritten ethics of their profession.

Mr. Roger Button, the president of Roger Button&Co., Wholesale Hardware, began to run toward Doctor Keene with much less dignity than was expected from a Southern gentleman of that picturesque period. “Doctor Keene!” he called. “Oh, Doctor Keene!”

The doctor heard him, faced around, and stood waiting, a curious expression settling on his harsh, medicinal face as Mr. Button drew near.

“What happened?” demanded Mr. Button, as he came up in a gasping rush. “What was it? How is she? A boy? Who is it? What—”

“Talk sense!” said Doctor Keene sharply, He appeared somewhat irritated.

“Is the child born?” begged Mr. Button.

Doctor Keene frowned. “Why, yes, I suppose so—after a fashion.” Again he threw a curious glance at Mr. Button.

“Is my wife all right?”

“Yes.”

“Is it a boy or a girl?”

“Here now!” cried Doctor Keene in a perfect passion of irritation, “I'll ask you to go and see for yourself. Outrageous!” He snapped the last word out in almost one syllable, then he turned away muttering: “Do you imagine a case like this will help my professional reputation? One more would ruin me—ruin anybody.”

“What's the matter?” demanded Mr. Button appalled. “Triplets?”

“No, not triplets!” answered the doctor cuttingly. “What's more, you can go and see for yourself. And get another doctor. I brought you into the world, young man, and I've been physician to your family for forty years, but I'm through with you! I don't want to see you or any of your relatives ever again! Good-by!”

Then he turned sharply, and without another word climbed into his phaeton, which was waiting at the curbstone, and drove severely away.

Mr. Button stood there upon the sidewalk, stupefied and trembling from head to foot. What horrible mishap had occurred? He had suddenly lost all desire to go into the Maryland Private Hospital for Ladies and Gentlemen—it was with the greatest difficulty that, a moment later, he forced himself to mount the steps and enter the front door.

A nurse was sitting behind a desk in the opaque gloom of the hall. Swallowing his shame, Mr. Button approached her.

“Good-morning,” she remarked, looking up at him pleasantly.

“Good-morning. I—I am Mr. Button.”

At this a look of utter terror spread itself over girl's face. She rose to her feet and seemed about to fly from the hall, restraining herself only with the most apparent difficulty.

“I want to see my child,” said Mr. Button.

The nurse gave a little scream. “Oh—of course!” she cried hysterically. “Upstairs. Right upstairs. Go—up!”

She pointed the direction, and Mr. Button, bathed in cool perspiration, turned falteringly, and began to mount to the second floor. In the upper hall he addressed another nurse who approached him, basin in hand. “I'm Mr. Button,” he managed to articulate. “I want to see my—”

Clank! The basin clattered to the floor and rolled in the direction of the stairs. Clank! Clank! It began a methodical decent as if sharing in the general terror which this gentleman provoked.

“I want to see my child!” Mr. Button almost shrieked. He was on the verge of collapse.

Clank! The basin reached the first floor. The nurse regained control of herself, and threw Mr. Button a look of hearty contempt.

“All right, Mr. Button,” she agreed in a hushed voice. “Very well! But if you knew what a state it's put us all in this morning! It's perfectly outrageous! The hospital will never have a ghost of a reputation after—”

“Hurry!” he cried hoarsely. “I can't stand this!”

“Come this way, then, Mr. Button.”

He dragged himself after her. At the end of a long hall they reached a room from which proceeded a variety of howls—indeed, a room which, in later parlance, would have been known as the“crying-room.” They entered. Ranged around the walls were half a dozen white-enameled rolling cribs, each with a tag tied at the head.

“Well,” gasped Mr. Button, “which is mine?”

“There!” said the nurse.

Mr. Button's eyes followed her pointing finger, and this is what he saw. Wrapped in a voluminous white blanket, and partly crammed into one of the cribs, there sat an old man apparently about seventy years of age. His sparse hair was almost white, and from his chin dripped a long smoke-colored beard, which waved absurdly back and forth, fanned by the breeze coming in at the window. He looked up at Mr. Button with dim, faded eyes in which lurked a puzzled question.

“Am I mad?” thundered Mr. Button, his terror resolving into rage. “Is this some ghastly hospital joke?

“It doesn't seem like a joke to us,” replied the nurse severely. “And I don't know whether you're mad or not—but that is most certainly your child.”

The cool perspiration redoubled on Mr. Button's forehead. He closed his eyes, and then, opening them, looked again. There was no mistake—he was gazing at a man of threescore and ten—a baby of threescore and ten, a baby whose feet hung over the sides of the crib in which it was reposing.

The old man looked placidly from one to the other for a moment, and then suddenly spoke in a cracked and ancient voice. “Are you my father?” he demanded.

Mr. Button and the nurse started violently.

“Because if you are,” went on the old man querulously, “I wish you'd get me out of this place—or, at least, get them to put a comfortable rocker in here,”

“Where in God's name did you come from? Who are you?” burst out Mr. Button frantically.

“I can't tell you exactly who I am,” replied the querulous whine, “because I've only been born a few hours—but my last name is certainly Button.”

“You lie! You're an impostor!”

The old man turned wearily to the nurse. “Nice way to welcome a new-born child,” he complained in a weak voice. “Tell him he's wrong, why don't you?”

“You're wrong. Mr. Button,” said the nurse severely. “This is your child, and you'll have to make the best of it. We're going to ask you to take him home with you as soon as possible-some time to-day.”

“Home?” repeated Mr. Button incredulously.

“Yes, we can't have him here. We really can't, you know?”

“I'm right glad of it,” whined the old man. “This is a fine place to keep a youngster of quiet tastes. With all this yelling and howling, I haven't been able to get a wink of sleep. I asked for something to eat”—here his voice rose to a shrill note of protest—“and they brought me a bottle of milk!”

Mr. Button, sank down upon a chair near his son and concealed his face in his hands. “My heavens!” he murmured, in an ecstasy of horror. “What will people say? What must I do?”

“You'll have to take him home,” insisted the nurse—“immediately!”

A grotesque picture formed itself with dreadful clarity before the eyes of the tortured man—a picture of himself walking through the crowded streets of the city with this appalling apparition stalking by his side. “I can't. I can't,” he moaned.

People would stop to speak to him, and what was he going to say? He would have to introduce this—this septuagenarian: “This is my son, born early this morning.” And then the old man would gather his blanket around him and they would plod on, past the bustling stores, the slave market—for a dark instant Mr. Button wished passionately that his son was black—past the luxurious houses of the residential district, past the home for the aged.…

“Come! Pull yourself together,” commanded the nurse.

“See here,” the old man announced suddenly, “if you think I'm going to walk home in this blanket, you're entirely mistaken.”

“Babies always have blankets.”

With a malicious crackle the old man held up a small white swaddling garment. “Look!” he quavered. “This is what they had ready for me.”

“Babies always wear those,” said the nurse primly.

“Well,” said the old man, “this baby's not going to wear anything in about two minutes. This blanket itches. They might at least have given mea sheet.”

“Keep it on! Keep it on!” said Mr. Button hurriedly. He turned to the nurse. “What'll I do?”

“Go down town and buy your son some clothes.”

Mr. Button's son's voice followed him down into the hall: “And a cane, father. I want to have a cane.”

Mr. Button banged the outer door savagely.…





II


“Good-morning,” Mr. Button said nervously, to the clerk in the Chesapeake Dry Goods Company. “I want to buy some clothes for my child.”

“How old is your child, sir?”

“About six hours,” answered Mr. Button, without due consideration.

“Babies' supply department in the rear.”

“Why, I don't think—I'm not sure that's what I want. It's—he's an unusually large-size child. Exceptionally—ah—large.”

“They have the largest child's sizes.”

“Where is the boys' department?” inquired Mr. Button, shifting his ground desperately. He felt that the clerk must surely scent his shameful secret.

“Right here.”

“Well—”He hesitated. The notion of dressing his son in men's clothes was repugnant to him. If, say, he could only find a very large boy's suit, he might cut off that long and awful beard, dye the white hair brown, and thus manage to conceal the worst, and to retain something of his own self-respect—not to mention his position in Baltimore society.

But a frantic inspection of the boys' department revealed no suits to fit the new-born Button. He blamed the store, of course—in such cases it is the thing to blame the store.

“How old did you say that boy of yours was?” demanded the clerk curiously.

“He's—sixteen.”

“Oh, I beg your pardon. I thought you said six hours. You'll find the youths' department in the next aisle.”

Mr. Button turned miserably away. Then he stopped, brightened, and pointed his finger toward a dressed dummy in the window display. “There!” he exclaimed. “I'll take that suit, out there on the dummy.”

The clerk stared. “Why,” he protested, “that's not a child's suit. At least it is, but it's for fancy dress. You could wear it yourself!”

“Wrap it up,” insisted his customer nervously. “That's what I want.”

The astonished clerk obeyed.

Back at the hospital Mr. Button entered the nursery and almost threw the package at his son. “Here's your clothes,” he snapped out.

The old man untied the package and viewed the contents with a quizzical eye.

“They look sort of funny to me,” he complained, “I don't want to be made a monkey of—”

“You've made a monkey of me!” retorted Mr. Button fiercely. “Never you mind how funny you look. Put them on—or I'll—or I'll spank you.” He swallowed uneasily at the penultimate word, feeling nevertheless that it was the proper thing to say.

“All right, father”—this with a grotesque simulation of filial respect—“you've lived longer; you know best. Just as you say.”

As before, the sound of the word“father”caused Mr. Button to start violently.

“And hurry.”

“I'm hurrying, father.”

When his son was dressed Mr. Button regarded him with depression. The costume consisted of dotted socks, pink pants, and a belted blouse with a wide white collar. Over the latter waved the long whitish beard, drooping almost to the waist. The effect was not good.

“Wait!”

Mr. Button seized a hospital shears and with three quick snaps amputated a large section of the beard. But even with this improvement the ensemble fell far short of perfection. The remaining brush of scraggly hair, the watery eyes, the ancient teeth, seemed oddly out of tone with the gaiety of the costume. Mr. Button, however, was obdurate—he held out his hand. “Come along!” he said sternly.

His son took the hand trustingly. “What are you going to call me, dad?” he quavered as they walked from the nursery—“Just ‘baby’ for a while? Till you think of a better name?”

Mr. Button grunted. “I don't know,” he answered harshly. “I think we'll call you Methuselah.”





III


Even after the new addition to the Button family had had his hair cut short and then dyed to a sparse unnatural black, had had his face shaved so dose that it glistened, and had been attired in small-boy clothes made to order by a flabbergasted tailor, it was impossible for Button to ignore the fact that his son was a excuse for a first family baby. Despite his aged stoop, Benjamin Button—for it was by this name they called him instead of by the appropriate but invidious Methuselah—was five feet eight inches tall. His clothes did not conceal this, nor did the clipping and dyeing of his eyebrows disguise the fact that the eyes under—were faded and watery and tired. In fact, the baby-nurse who had been engaged in advance left the house after one look, in a state of considerable indignation.

But Mr. Button persisted in his unwavering purpose. Benjamin was a baby, and a baby he should remain. At first he declared that if Benjamin didn't like warm milk he could go without food altogether, but he was finally prevailed upon to allow his son bread and butter, and even oatmeal by way of a compromise. One day he brought home a rattle and, giving it to Benjamin, insisted in no uncertain terms that he should“play with it,” whereupon the old man took it with—a weary expression and could be heard jingling it obediently at intervals throughout the day.

There can be no doubt, though, that the rattle bored him, and that he found other and more soothing amusements when he was left alone. For instance, Mr. Button discovered one day that during the preceding week be had smoked more cigars than ever before—a phenomenon, which was explained a few days later when, entering the nursery unexpectedly, he found the room full of faint blue haze and Benjamin, with a guilty expression on his face, trying to conceal the butt of a dark Havana. This, of course, called for a severe spanking, but Mr. Button found that he could not bring himself to administer it. He merely warned his son that he would“stunt his growth.”

Nevertheless he persisted in his attitude. He brought home lead soldiers, he brought toy trains, he brought large pleasant animals made of cotton, and, to perfect the illusion which he was creating—for himself at least—he passionately demanded of the clerk in the toy-store whether“the paint would come oft the pink duck if the baby put it in his mouth.” But, despite all his father's efforts, Benjamin refused to be interested. He would steal down the back stairs and return to the nursery with a volume of the“Encyclopedia Britannica”, over which he would pore through an afternoon, while his cotton cows and his Noah's ark were left neglected on the floor. Against such a stubbornness Mr. Button's efforts were of little avail.

The sensation created in Baltimore was, at first, prodigious. What the mishap would have cost the Buttons and their kinsfolk socially cannot be determined, for the outbreak of the Civil War drew the city's attention to other things. A few people who were unfailingly polite racked their brains for compliments to give to the parents—and finally hit upon the ingenious device of declaring that the baby resembled his grandfather, a fact which, due to the standard state of decay common to all men of seventy, could not be denied. Mr. and Mrs. Roger Button were not pleased, and Benjamin's grandfather was furiously insulted.

Benjamin, once he left the hospital, took life as he found it. Several small boys were brought to see him, and he spent a stiff-jointed afternoon trying to work up an interest in tops and marbles—he even managed, quite accidentally, to break a kitchen window with a stone from a sling shot, a feat which secretly delighted his father.

Thereafter Benjamin contrived to break something every day, but he did these things only because they were expected of him, and because he was by nature obliging.

When his grandfather's initial antagonism wore off, Benjamin and that gentleman took enormous pleasure in one another's company. They would sit for hours, these two, so far apart in age and experience, and, like old cronies, discuss with tireless monotony the slow events of the day. Benjamin felt more at ease in his grandfather's presence than in his parents'—they seemed always somewhat in awe of him and, despite the dictatorial authority they exercised over him, frequently addressed him as“Mr.”

He was as puzzled as any one else at the apparently advanced age of his mind and body at birth. He read up on it in the medical journal, but found that no such case had been previously recorded. At his father's urging he made an honest attempt to play with other boys, and frequently he joined in the milder games—football shook him up too much, and he feared that in case of a fracture his ancient bones would refuse to knit.

When he was five he was sent to kindergarten, where he initiated into the art of pasting green paper on orange paper, of weaving colored maps and manufacturing eternal cardboard necklaces. He was inclined to drowse off to sleep in the middle of these tasks, a habit which both irritated and frightened his young teacher. To his relief she complained to his parents, and he was removed from the school. The Roger Buttons told their friends that they felt he was too young.

By the time he was twelve years old his parents had grown used to him. Indeed, so strong is the force of custom that they no longer felt that he was different from any other child—except when some curious anomaly reminded them of the fact. But one day a few weeks after his twelfth birthday, while looking in the mirror, Benjamin made, or thought he made, an astonishing discovery. Did his eyes deceive him, or had his hair turned in the dozen years of his life from white to iron-gray under its concealing dye? Was the network of wrinkles on his face becoming less pronounced? Was his skin healthier and firmer, with even a touch of ruddy winter color? He could not tell. He knew that he no longer stooped, and that his physical condition had improved since the early days of his life.

“Can it be—?” he thought to himself, or, rather, scarcely dared to think.

He went to his father. “I am grown,” he announced determinedly. “I want to put on long trousers.”

His father hesitated. “Well,” he said finally, “I don't know. Fourteen is the age for putting on long trousers—and you are only twelve.”

“But you'll have to admit,” protested Benjamin, “that I'm big for my age.”

His father looked at him with illusory speculation. “Oh, I'm not so sure of that,” he said. “I was as big as you when I was twelve.”

This was not true—it was all part of Roger Button's silent agreement with himself to believe in his son's normality.

Finally a compromise was reached. Benjamin was to continue to dye his hair. He was to make a better attempt to play with boys of his own age. He was not to wear his spectacles or carry a cane in the street. In return for these concessions he was allowed his first suit of long trousers.…





IV


Of the life of Benjamin Button between his twelfth and twenty-first year I intend to say little. Suffice to record that they were years of normal ungrowth. When Benjamin was eighteen he was erect as a man offifty; he had more hair and it was of a dark gray; his step was firm, his voice had lost its cracked quaver and descended to a healthy baritone. So his father sent him up to Connecticut to take examinations for entrance to Yale College. Benjamin passed his examination and became a member of the freshman class.

On the third day following his matriculation he received a notification from Mr. Hart, the college registrar, to call at his office and arrange his schedule. Benjamin, glancing in the mirror, decided that his hair needed a new application of its brown dye, but an anxious inspection of his bureau drawer disclosed that the dye bottle was not there. Then he remembered—he had emptied it the day before and thrown it away.

He was in a dilemma. He was due at the registrar's in five minutes. There seemed to be no help for it—he must go as he was. He did.

“Good-morning,” said the registrar politely. “You've come to inquire about your son.”

“Why, as a matter of fact, my name's Button—”began Benjamin, but Mr. Hart cut him off.

“I'm very glad to meet you, Mr. Button. I'm expecting your son here any minute.”

“That's me!” burst out Benjamin. “I'm a freshman.”

“What!”

“I'm a freshman.”

“Surely you're joking.”

“Not at all.”

The registrar frowned and glanced at a card before him. “Why, I have Mr. Benjamin Button's age down here as eighteen.”

“That's my age,” asserted Benjamin, flushing slightly.

The registrar eyed him wearily. “Now surely, Mr. Button, you don't expect me to believe that.”

Benjamin smiled wearily. “I am eighteen,” he repeated.

The registrar pointed sternly to the door. “Get out,” he said. “Get out of college and get out of town. You are a dangerous lunatic.”

“I am eighteen.”

Mr. Hart opened the door. “The idea!” he shouted. “A man of your age trying to enter here as a freshman. Eighteen years old, are you? Well, I'll give you eighteen minutes to get out of town.”

Benjamin Button walked with dignity from the room, and half a dozen undergraduates, who were waiting in the hall, followed him curiously with their eyes. When he had gone a little way he turned around, faced the infuriated registrar, who was still standing in the door-way, and repeated in a firm voice: “I am eighteen years old.”

To a chorus of titters which went up from the group of undergraduates, Benjamin walked away.

But he was not fated to escape so easily. On his melancholy walk to the railroad station he found that he was being followed by a group, then by a swarm, and finally by a dense mass of undergraduates. The word had gone around that a lunatic had passed the entrance examinations for Yale and attempted to palm himself off as a youth of eighteen. A fever of excitement permeated the college. Men ran hatless out of classes, the football team abandoned its practice and joined the mob, professors' wives with bonnets awry and bustles out of position, ran shouting after the procession, from which proceeded a continual succession of remarks aimed at the tender sensibilities of Benjamin Button.

“He must be the wandering Jew!”

“He ought to go to prep school at his age!”

“Look at the infant prodigy!”

“He thought this was the old men's home.”

“Go up to Harvard!”

Benjamin increased his gait, and soon he was running. He would show them! He would go to Harvard, and then they would regret these ill-considered taunts!

Safely on board the train for Baltimore, he put his head from the window. “You'll regret this!” he shouted.

“Ha-ha!” the undergraduates laughed. “Ha-ha-ha!” It was the biggest mistake that Yale College had ever made.…

In 1880 Benjamin Button was twenty years old, and he signalised his birthday by going to work for his father in Roger Button&Co., Wholesale Hardware. It was in that same year that he began“going out socially”—that is, his father insisted on taking him to several fashionable dances. Roger Button was now fifty, and he and his son were more and more companionable—in fact, since Benjamin had ceased to dye his hair (which was still grayish) they appeared about the same age, and could have passed for brothers.

One night in August they got into the phaeton attired in their full-dress suits and drove out to a dance at the Shevlins' country house, situated just outside of Baltimore. It was a gorgeous evening. A full moon drenched the road to the lustreless color of platinum, and late-blooming harvest flowers breathed into the motionless air aromas that were like low, half-heard laughter. The open country, carpeted for rods around with bright wheat, was translucent as in the day. It was almost impossible not to be affected by the sheer beauty of the sky—almost.

“There's a great future in the dry-goods business,” Roger Button was saying. He was not a spiritual man—his aesthetic sense was rudimentary.

“Old fellows like me can't learn new tricks,” he observed profoundly. “It's you youngsters with energy and vitality that have the great future before you.”

Far up the road the lights of the Shevlins' country house drifted into view, and presently there was a sighing sound that crept persistently toward them—it might have been the fine plaint of violins or the rustle of the silver wheat under the moon.

They pulled up behind a handsome brougham whose passengers were disembarking at the door. A lady got out, then an elderly gentleman, then another young lady, beautiful as sin. Benjamin started; an almost chemical change seemed to dissolve and recompose the very elements of his body. A rigour passed over him, blood rose into his cheeks, his forehead, and there was a steady thumping in his ears. It was first love.

The girl was slender and frail, with hair that was ashen under the moon and honey-colored under the sputtering gas-lamps of the porch. Over her shoulders was thrown a Spanish mantilla of softest yellow, butter flied in black; her feet were glittering buttons at the hem of her bustled dress.

Roger Button leaned over to his son. “That,” he said, “is young Hildegarde Moncrief, the daughter of General Moncrief.”

Benjamin nodded coldly. “Pretty little thing,” he said indifferently. But when the negro boy had led the buggy away, he added: “Dad, you might introduce me to her.”

They approached a group, of which Miss Moncrief was the centre. Reared in the old tradition, she curtsied low before Benjamin. Yes, he might have a dance. He thanked her and walked away—staggered away.

The interval until the time for his turn should arrive dragged itself out interminably. He stood close to the wall, silent, inscrutable, watching with murderous eyes the young bloods of Baltimore as they eddied around Hildegarde Moncrief, passionate admiration in their faces. How obnoxious they seemed to Benjamin; how intolerably rosy! Their curling brown whiskers aroused in him a feeling equivalent to indigestion.

But when his own time came, and he drifted with her out upon the changing floor to the music of the latest waltz from Paris, his jealousies and anxieties melted from him like a mantle of snow. Blind with enchantment, he felt that life was just beginning.

“You and your brother got here just as we did, didn't you?” asked Hildegarde, looking up at him with eyes that were like bright blue enamel.

Benjamin hesitated. If she took him for his father's brother, would it be best to enlighten her? He remembered his experience at Yale, so he decided against it. It would be rude to contradict a lady; it would be criminal to mar this exquisite occasion with the grotesque story of his origin. Later, perhaps. So he nodded, smiled, listened, was happy.

“I like men of your age,” Hildegarde told him. “Young boys are so idiotic. They tell me how much champagne they drink at college, and how much money they lose playing cards. Men of your age know how to appreciate women.”

Benjamin felt himself on the verge of a proposal—with an effort he choked back the impulse.

“You're just the romantic age,” she continued—“fifty. Twenty-five is too wordly-wise; thirty is apt to be pale from overwork; forty is the age of long stories that take a whole cigar to tell; sixty is—oh, sixty is too near seventy; but fifty is the mellow age. I love fifty.”

Fifty seemed to Benjamin a glorious age. He longed passionately to be fifty.

“I've always said,” went on Hildegarde, “that I'd rather marry a man of fifty and be taken care of than many a man of thirty and take care of him.”

For Benjamin the rest of the evening was bathed in a honey-colored mist. Hildegarde gave him two more dances, and they discovered that they were marvellously in accord on all the questions of the day. She was to go driving with him on the following Sunday, and then they would discuss all these questions further.

Going home in the phaeton just before the crack of dawn, when the first bees were humming and the fading moon glimmered in the cool dew, Benjamin knew vaguely that his father was discussing wholesale hardware.

“.…And what do you think should merit our biggest attention after hammers and nails?” the elder Button was saying.

“Love,” replied Benjamin absent-mindedly.

“Lugs?” exclaimed Roger Button, “Why, I've just covered the question of lugs.”

Benjamin regarded him with dazed eyes just as the eastern sky was suddenly cracked with light, and an oriole yawned piercingly in the quickening trees.…





VI


When, six months later, the engagement of Miss Hildegarde Moncrief to Mr. Benjamin Button was made known (I say“made known,” for General Moncrief declared he would rather fall upon his sword than announce it), the excitement in Baltimore society reached a feverish pitch. The almost forgotten story of Benjamin's birth was remembered and sent out upon the winds of scandal in picaresque and incredible forms. It was said that Benjamin was really the father of Roger Button, that he was his brother who had been in prison for forty years, that he was John Wilkes Booth in disguise—and, finally, that he had two small conical horns sprouting from his head.

The Sunday supplements of the New York papers played up the case with fascinating sketches which showed the head of Benjamin Button attached to a fish, to a snake, and, finally, to a body of solid brass. He became known, journalistically, as the Mystery Man of Maryland. But the true story, as is usually the case, had a very small circulation.

However, every one agreed with General Moncrief that it was“criminal”for a lovely girl who could have married any beau in Baltimore to throw herself into the arms of a man who was assuredly fifty. In vain Mr. Roger Button published his son's birth certificate in large type in the Baltimore Blaze. No one believed it. You had only to look at Benjamin and see.

On the part of the two people most concerned there was no wavering. So many of the stories about her fiancé were false that Hildegarde refused stubbornly to believe even the true one. In vain General Moncrief pointed out to her the high mortality among men of fifty—or, at least, among men who looked fifty; in vain he told her of the instability of the wholesale hardware business. Hildegarde had chosen to marry for mellowness, and marry she did.…





VII


In one particular, at least, the friends of Hildegarde Moncrief were mistaken. The wholesale hardware business prospered amazingly. In the fifteen years between Benjamin Button's marriage in 1880 and his father's retirement in 1895, the family fortune was doubled—and this was due largely to the younger member of the firm.

Needless to say, Baltimore eventually received the couple to its bosom. Even old General Moncrief became reconciled to his son-in-law when Benjamin gave him the money to bring out his“History of the Civil War”in twenty volumes, which had been refused by nine prominent publishers.

In Benjamin himself fifteen years had wrought many changes. It seemed to him that the blood flowed with new vigour through his veins. It began to be a pleasure to rise in the morning, to walk with an active step along the busy, sunny street, to work untiringly with his shipments of hammers and his cargoes of nails. It was in 1890 that he executed his famous business coup: he brought up the suggestion that all nails used in nailing up the boxes in which nails are shipped are the property of the shippee, a proposal which became a statute, was approved by Chief Justice Fossile, and saved Roger Button and Company, Wholesale Hardware, more than six hundred nails every year.

In addition, Benjamin discovered that he was becoming more and more attracted by the gay side of life. It was typical of his growing enthusiasm for pleasure that he was the first man in the city of Baltimore to own and run an automobile. Meeting him on the street, his contemporaries would stare enviously at the picture he made of health and vitality.

“He seems to grow younger every year,” they would remark. And if old Roger Button, now sixty-five years old, had failed at first to give a proper welcome to his son he atoned at last by bestowing on him what amounted to adulation.

And here we come to an unpleasant subject which it will be well to pass over as quickly as possible. There was only one thing that worried Benjamin Button; his wife had ceased to attract him.

At that time Hildegarde was a woman of thirty-five, with a son, Roscoe, fourteen years old. In the early days of their marriage Benjamin had worshipped her. But, as the years passed, her honey-colored hair became an unexciting brown, the blue enamel of her eyes assumed the aspect of cheap crockery—moreover, and, most of all, she had become too settled in her ways, too placid, too content, too anaemic in her excitements, and too sober in her taste. As a bride it been she who had“dragged”Benjamin to dances and dinners—now conditions were reversed. She went out socially with him, but without enthusiasm, devoured already by that eternal inertia which comes to live with each of us one day and stays with us to the end.

Benjamin's discontent waxed stronger. At the outbreak of the Spanish-American War in 1898 his home had for him so little charm that he decided to join the army. With his business influence he obtained a commission as captain, and proved so adaptable to the work that he was made a major, and finally a lieutenant-colonel just in time to participate in the celebrated charge up San Juan Hill. He was slightly wounded, and received a medal.

Benjamin had become so attached to the activity and excitement of array life that he regretted to give it up, but his business required attention, so he resigned his commission and came home. He was met at the station by a brass band and escorted to his house.





VIII


Hildegarde, waving a large silk flag, greeted him on the porch, and even as he kissed her he felt with a sinking of the heart that these three years had taken their toll. She was a woman of forty now, with a faint skirmish line of gray hairs in her head. The sight depressed him.

Up in his room he saw his reflection in the familiar mirror—he went closer and examined his own face with anxiety, comparing it after a moment with a photograph of himself in uniform taken just before the war.

“Good Lord!” he said aloud. The process was continuing. There was no doubt of it—he looked now like a man of thirty. Instead of being delighted, he was uneasy—he was growing younger. He had hitherto hoped that once he reached a bodily age equivalent to his age in years, the grotesque phenomenon which had marked his birth would cease to function. He shuddered. His destiny seemed to him awful, incredible.

When he came down-stairs Hildegarde was waiting for him. She appeared annoyed, and he wondered if she had at last discovered that there was something amiss. It was with an effort to relieve the tension between them that he broached the matter at dinner in what he considered a delicate way.

“Well,” he remarked lightly, “everybody says I look younger than ever.”

Hildegarde regarded him with scorn. She sniffed. “Do you think it's anything to boast about?”

“I'm not boasting,” he asserted uncomfortably. She sniffed again. “The idea,” she said, and after a moment: “I should think you'd have enough pride to stop it.”

“How can I?” he demanded.

“I'm not going to argue with you,” she retorted. “But there's a right way of doing things and a wrong way. If you've made up your mind to be different from everybody else, I don't suppose I can stop you, but I really don't think it's very considerate.”

“But, Hildegarde, I can't help it.”

“You can too. You're simply stubborn. You think you don't want to be like any one else. You always have been that way, and you always will be. But just think how it would be if every one else looked at things as you do—what would the world be like?”

As this was an inane and unanswerable argument Benjamin made no reply, and from that time on a chasm began to widen between them. He wondered what possible fascination she had ever exercised over him.

To add to the breach, he found, as the new century gathered headway, that his thirst for gaiety grew stronger. Never a party of any kind in the city of Baltimore but he was there, dancing with the prettiest of the young married women, chatting with the most popular of the débutantes, and finding their company charming, while his wife, a dowager of evil omen, sat among the chaperons, now in haughty disapproval, and now following him with solemn, puzzled, and reproachful eyes.

“Look!” people would remark. “What a pity! A young fellow that age tied to a woman of forty-five. He must be twenty years younger than his wife.” They had forgotten—as people inevitably forget—that back in 1880 their mammas and papas had also remarked about this same ill-matched pair.

Benjamin's growing unhappiness at home was compensated for by his many new interests. He took up golf and made a great success of it. He went in for dancing: in 1906 he was an expert at“The Boston,” and in 1908 he was considered proficient at the“Maxixe,” while in 1909 his“Castle Walk”was the envy of every young man in town.

His social activities, of course, interfered to some extent with his business, but then he had worked hard at wholesale hardware for twenty-five years and felt that he could soon hand it on to his son, Roscoe, who had recently graduated from Harvard.

He and his son were, in fact, often mistaken for each other. This pleased Benjamin—he soon forgot the insidious fear which had come over him on his return from the Spanish-American War, and grew to take a naïve pleasure in his appearance. There was only one fly in the delicious ointment—he hated to appear in public with his wife. Hildegarde was almost fifty, and the sight of her made him feel absurd.…





IX


One September day in 1910—a few years after Roger Button&Co., Wholesale Hardware, had been handed over to young Roscoe Button—a man, apparently about twenty years old, entered himself as a freshman at Harvard University in Cambridge. He did not make the mistake of announcing that he would never see fifty again, nor did he mention the fact that his son had been graduated from the same institution ten years before.

He was admitted, and almost immediately attained a prominent position in the class, partly because he seemed a little older than the other freshmen, whose average age was about eighteen.

But his success was largely due to the fact that in the football game with Yale he played so brilliantly, with so much dash and with such a cold, remorseless anger that he scored seven touchdowns and fourteen field goals for Harvard, and caused one entire eleven of Yale men to be carried singly from the field, unconscious. He was the most celebrated man in college.

Strange to say, in his third or junior year he was scarcely able to“make”the team. The coaches said that he had lost weight, and it seemed to the more observant among them that he was not quite as tall as before. He made no touchdowns—indeed, he was retained on the team chiefly in hope that his enormous reputation would bring terror and disorganisation to the Yale team.

In his senior year he did not make the team at all. He had grown so slight and frail that one day he was taken by some sophomores for a freshman, an incident which humiliated him terribly. He became known as something of a prodigy—a senior who was surely no more than sixteen—and he was often shocked at the worldliness of some of his classmates. His studies seemed harder to him—he felt that they were too advanced. He had heard his classmates speak of St. Midas', the famous preparatory school, at which so many of them had prepared for college, and he determined after his graduation to enter himself at St. Midas', where the sheltered life among boys his own size would be more congenial to him.

Upon his graduation in 1914 he went home to Baltimore with his Harvard diploma in his pocket. Hildegarde was now residing in Italy, so Benjamin went to live with his son, Roscoe. But though he was welcomed in a general way there was obviously no heartiness in Roscoe's feeling toward him—there was even perceptible a tendency on his son's part to think that Benjamin, as he moped about the house in adolescent mooniness, was somewhat in the way. Roscoe was married now and prominent in Baltimore life, and he wanted no scandal to creep out in connection with his family.

Benjamin, no longer persona grata with the débutantes and younger college set, found himself left much done, except for the companionship of three or four fifteen-year-old boys in the neighbourhood. His idea of going to St. Midas' school recurred to him.

“Say,” he said to Roscoe one day, “I've told you over and over that I want to go to prep school.”

“Well, go, then,” replied Roscoe shortly. The matter was distasteful to him, and he wished to avoid a discussion.

“I can't go alone,” said Benjamin helplessly. “You'll have to enter me and take me up there.”

“I haven't got time,” declared Roscoe abruptly. His eyes narrowed and he looked uneasily at his father. “As a matter of fact,” he added, “you'd better not go on with this business much longer. You better pull up short. You better—you better”—he paused and his face crimsoned as he sought for words—“you better turn right around and start back the other way. This has gone too far to be a joke. It isn't funny any longer. You—you behave yourself!”

Benjamin looked at him, on the verge of tears.

“And another thing,” continued Roscoe, “when visitors are in the house I want you to call me ‘Uncle’—not ‘Roscoe,’ but ‘Uncle,’ do you understand? It looks absurd for a boy of fifteen to call me by my first name. Perhaps you'd better call me ‘Uncle’ all the time, so you'll get used to it.”

With a harsh look at his father, Roscoe turned away.…





X


At the termination of this interview, Benjamin wandered dismally upstairs and stared at himself in the mirror. He had not shaved for three months, but he could find nothing on his face but a faint white down with which it seemed unnecessary to meddle. When he had first come home from Harvard, Roscoe had approached him with the proposition that he should wear eye-glasses and imitation whiskers glued to his cheeks, and it had seemed for a moment that the farce of his early years was to be repeated. But whiskers had itched and made him ashamed. He wept and Roscoe had reluctantly relented.

Benjamin opened a book of boys' stories, The Boy Scouts in Bimini Bay, and began to read. But he found himself thinking persistently about the war. America had joined the Allied cause during the preceding month, and Benjamin wanted to enlist, but, alas, sixteen was the minimum age, and he did not look that old. His true age, which was fifty-seven, would have disqualified him, anyway.

There was a knock at his door, and the butler appeared with a letter bearing a large official legend in the corner and addressed to Mr. Benjamin Button. Benjamin tore it open eagerly, and read the enclosure with delight. It informed him that many reserve officers who had served in the Spanish-American War were being called back into service with a higher rank, and it enclosed his commission as brigadier-general in the United States army with orders to report immediately.

Benjamin jumped to his feet fairly quivering with enthusiasm. This was what he had wanted. He seized his cap, and ten minutes later he had entered a large tailoring establishment on Charles Street, and asked in his uncertain treble to be measured for a uniform.

“Want to play soldier, sonny?” demanded a clerk casually.

Benjamin flushed. “Say! Never mind what I want!” he retorted angrily. “My name's Button and I live on Mt. Vernon Place, so you know I'm good for it.”

“Well,” admitted the clerk hesitantly, “if you're not, I guess your daddy is, all right.”

Benjamin was measured, and a week later his uniform was completed. He had difficulty in obtaining the proper general's insignia because the dealer kept insisting to Benjamin that a nice Y.W.C.A. badge would look just as well and be much more fun to play with.

Saying nothing to Roscoe, he left the house one night and proceeded by train to Camp Mosby, in South Carolina, where he was to command an infantry brigade. On a sultry April day he approached the entrance to the camp, paid off the taxicab which had brought him from the station, and turned to the sentry on guard.

“Get some one to handle my luggage!” he said briskly.

The sentry eyed him reproachfully. “Say,” he remarked, “where you goin' with the general's duds, sonny?”

Benjamin, veteran of the Spanish-American War, whirled upon him with fire in his eye, but with, alas, a changing treble voice.

“Come to attention!” he tried to thunder; he paused for breath—then suddenly he saw the sentry snap his heels together and bring his rifle to the present. Benjamin concealed a smile of gratification, but when he glanced around his smile faded. It was not he who had inspired obedience, but an imposing artillery colonel who was approaching on horseback.

“Colonel!” called Benjamin shrilly.

The colonel came up, drew rein, and looked coolly down at him with a twinkle in his eyes. “Whose little boy are you?” he demanded kindly.

“I'll soon darn well show you whose little boy I am!” retorted Benjamin in a ferocious voice. “Get down off that horse!”

The colonel roared with laughter.

“You want him, eh, general?”

“Here!” cried Benjamin desperately. “Read this.” And he thrust his commission toward the colonel.

The colonel read it, his eyes popping from their sockets.

“Where'd you get this?” he demanded, slipping the document into his own pocket.

“I got it from the Government, as you'll soon find out!”

“You come along with me,” said the colonel with a peculiar look. “We'll go up to headquarters and talk this over. Come along.”

The colonel turned and began walking his horse in the direction of headquarters. There was nothing for Benjamin to do but follow with as much dignity as possible—meanwhile promising himself a stern revenge. But this revenge did not materialise. Two days later, however, his son Roscoe materialised from Baltimore, hot and cross from a hasty trip, and escorted the weeping general, sans uniform, back to his home.





XI


In 1920 Roscoe Button's first child was born. During the attendant festivities, however, no one thought it“the thing”to mention, that the little grubby boy, apparently about ten years of age who played around the house with lead soldiers and a miniature circus, was the new baby's own grandfather.

No one disliked the little boy whose fresh, cheerful face was crossed with just a hint of sadness, but to Roscoe Button his presence was a source of torment. In the idiom of his generation Roscoe did not consider the matter “efficient.” It seemed to him that his father, in refusing to look sixty, had not behaved like a“red-blooded he-man”—this was Roscoe's favourite expression—but in a curious and perverse manner. Indeed, to think about the matter for as much as a half an hour drove him to the edge of insanity. Roscoe believed that“live wires”should keep young, but carrying it out on such a scale was—was—was inefficient. And there Roscoe rested.

Five years later Roscoe's little boy had grown old enough to play childish games with little Benjamin under the supervision of the same nurse. Roscoe took them both to kindergarten on the same day, and Benjamin found that playing with little strips of colored paper, making mats and chains and curious and beautiful designs, was the most fascinating game in the world. Once he was bad and had to stand in the corner—then he cried—but for the most part there were gay hours in the cheerful room, with the sunlight coming in the windows and Miss Bailey's kind hand resting for a moment now and then in his tousled hair.

Roscoe's son moved up into the first grade after a year, but Benjamin stayed on in the kindergarten. He was very happy. Sometimes when other tots talked about what they would do when they grew up a shadow would cross his little face as if in a dim, childish way he realised that those were things in which he was never to share.

The days flowed on in monotonous content. He went back a third year to the kindergarten, but he was too little now to understand what the bright shining strips of paper were for. He cried because the other boys were bigger than he, and he was afraid of them. The teacher talked to him, but though he tried to understand he could not understand at all.

He was taken from the kindergarten. His nurse, Nana, in her starched gingham dress, became the centre of his tiny world. On bright days they walked in the park; Nana would point at a great gray monster and say“elephant,” and Benjamin would say it after her, and when he was being undressed for bed that night he would say it over and over aloud to her: “Elyphant, elyphant, elyphant.” Sometimes Nana let him jump on the bed, which was fun, because if you sat down exactly right it would bounce you up on your feet again, and if you said“Ah”for a long time while you jumped you got a very pleasing broken vocal effect.

He loved to take a big cane from the hat-rack and go around hitting chairs and tables with it and saying: “Fight, fight, fight.” When there were people there the old ladies would cluck at him, which interested him, and the young ladies would try to kiss him, which he submitted to with mild boredom. And when the long day was done at five o'clock he would go upstairs with Nana and be fed on oatmeal and nice soft mushy foods with a spoon.

There were no troublesome memories in his childish sleep; no token came to him of his brave days at college, of the glittering years when he flustered the hearts of many girls. There were only the white, safe walls of his crib and Nana and a man who came to see him sometimes, and a great big orange ball that Nana pointed at just before his twilight bed hour and called“sun.” When the sun went his eyes were sleepy—there were no dreams, no dreams to haunt him.

The past—the wild charge at the head of his men up San Juan Hill; the first years of his marriage when he worked late into the summer dusk down in the busy city for young Hildegarde whom he loved; the days before that when he sat smoking far into the night in the gloomy old Button house on Monroe Street with his grandfather-all these had faded like unsubstantial dreams from his mind as though they had never been. He did not remember.

He did not remember clearly whether the milk was warm or cool at his last feeding or how the days passed—there was only his crib and Nana's familiar presence. And then he remembered nothing. When he was hungry he cried—that was all. Through the noons and nights he breathed and over him there were soft mumblings and murmurings that he scarcely heard, and faintly differentiated smells, and light and darkness.

Then it was all dark, and his white crib and the dim faces that moved above him, and the warm sweet aroma of the milk, faded out altogether from his mind.





THE DIAMOND AS BIG AS THE RITZ


I


John T. Unger came from a family that had been well known in Hades—a small town on the Mississippi River—for several generations. John's father had held the amateur golf championship through many a heated contest; Mrs. Unger was known“from hot-box to hot-bed,” as the local phrase went, for her political addresses; and young John T. Unger, who had just turned sixteen, had danced all the latest dances from New York before he put on long trousers. And now, for a certain time, he was to be away from home. That respect for a New England education which is the bane of all provincial places, which drains them yearly of their most promising young men, had seized upon his parents. Nothing would suit them but that he should go to St. Midas' School near Boston—Hades was too small to hold their darling and gifted son.

Now in Hades—as you know if you ever have been there—the names of the more fashionable preparatory schools and colleges mean very little. The inhabitants have been so long out of the world that, though they make a show of keeping up to date in dress and manners and literature, they depend to a great extent on hearsay, and a function that in Hades would be considered elaborate would doubtless be hailed by a Chicago beef-princess as“perhaps a little tacky.”

John T. Unger was on the eve of departure. Mrs. Unger, with maternal fatuity, packed his trunks full of linen suits and electric fans, and Mr. Unger presented his son with an asbestos pocket-book stuffed with money.

“Remember, you are always welcome here,” he said. “You can be sure, boy, that we'll keep the home fires burning.”

“I know,” answered John huskily.

“Don't forget who you are and where you come from,” continued his father proudly, “and you can do nothing to harm you. You are an Unger—from Hades.”

So the old man and the young shook hands, and John walked away with tears streaming from his eyes. Ten minutes later he had passed outside the city limits and he stopped to glance back for the last time. Over the gates the old-fashioned Victorian motto seemed strangely attractive to him. His father had tried time and time again to have it changed to something with a little more push and verve about it, such as“Hades—Your Opportunity,” or else a plain“Welcome”sign set over a hearty handshake pricked out in electric lights. The old motto was a little depressing, Mr. Unger had thought—but now….

So John took his look and then set his face resolutely toward his destination. And, as he turned away, the lights of Hades against the sky seemed full of a warm and passionate beauty.




St. Midas' School is half an hour from Boston in a Rolls-Pierce motor-car. The actual distance will never be known, for no one, except John T. Unger, had ever arrived there save in a Rolls-Pierce and probably no one ever will again. St. Midas' is the most expensive and the most exclusive boys' preparatory school in the world.

John's first two years there passed pleasantly. The fathers of all the boys were money-kings, and John spent his summer visiting at fashionable resorts. While he was very fond of all the boys he visited, their fathers struck him as being much of a piece, and in his boyish way he often wondered at their exceeding sameness. When he told them where his home was they would ask jovially, “Pretty hot down there?” and John would muster a faint smile and answer, “It certainly is.” His response would have been heartier had they not all made this joke—at best varying it with, “Is it hot enough for you down there?” which he hated just as much.

In the middle of his second year at school, a quiet, handsome boy named Percy Washington had been put in John's form. The new-comer was pleasant in his manner and exceedingly well dressed even for St. Midas', but for some reason he kept aloof from the other boys. The only person with whom he was intimate was John T. Unger, but even to John he was entirely uncommunicative concerning his home or his family. That he was wealthy went without saying, but beyond a few such deductions John knew little of his friend, so it promised rich confectionery for his curiosity when Percy invited him to spend the summer at his home“in the West.” He accepted, without hesitation.

It was only when they were in the train that Percy became, for the first time, rather communicative. One day while they were eating lunch in the dining-car and discussing the imperfect characters of several of the boys at school, Percy suddenly changed his tone and made an abrupt remark.

“My father,” he said, “is by far the richest man in the world.”

“Oh,” said John politely. He could think of no answer to make to this confidence. He considered“That's very nice,” but it sounded hollow and was on the point of saying, “Really?” but refrained since it would seem to question Percy's statement. And such an astounding statement could scarcely be questioned.

“By far the richest,” repeated Percy.

“I was reading in the World Almanac,” began John, “that there was one man in America with an income of over five million a years and four men with incomes of over three million a year, and—”

“Oh, they're nothing.” Percy's mouth was a half-moon of scorn. “Catch-penny capitalists, financial small-fry, petty merchants and money-lenders. My father could buy them out and not know he'd done it.”

“But how does he—”

“Why haven't they put down his income-tax? Because he doesn't pay any. At least he pays a little one—but he doesn't pay any on his real income.”

“He must be very rich,” said John simply, “I'm glad. I like very rich people.

“The richer a fella is, the better I like him.” There was a look of passionate frankness upon his dark face. “I visited the Schnlitzer-Murphys last Easter. Vivian Schnlitzer-Murphy had rubies as big as hen's eggs, and sapphires that were like globes with lights inside them—”

“I love jewels,” agreed Percy enthusiastically. “Of course I wouldn't want any one at school to know about it, but I've got quite a collection myself. I used to collect them instead of stamps.”

“And diamonds,” continued John eagerly. “The Schnlitzer-Murphys had diamonds as big as walnuts—”

“That's nothing.” Percy had leaned forward and dropped his voice to a low whisper. “That's nothing at all. My father has a diamond bigger than the Ritz-Carlton Hotel.”

The Montana sunset lay between two mountains like a gigantic bruise from which dark arteries spread themselves over a poisoned sky. An immense distance under the sky crouched the village of Fish, minute, dismal, and forgotten. There were twelve men, so it was said, in the village of Fish, twelve sombre and inexplicable souls who sucked a lean milk from the almost literally bare rock upon which a mysterious populatory force had begotten them. They had become a race apart, these twelve men of Fish, like some species developed by an early whim of nature, which on second thought had abandoned them to struggle and extermination.

Out of the blue-black bruise in the distance crept a long line of moving lights upon the desolation of the land, and the twelve men of Fish gathered like ghosts at the shanty depot to watch the passing of the seven o'clock train, the Transcontinental Express from Chicago. Six times or so a year the Transcontinental Express, through some inconceivable jurisdiction, stopped at the village of Fish, and when this occurred a figure or so would disembark, mount into a buggy that always appeared from out of the dusk, and drive off toward the bruised sunset. The observation of this pointless and preposterous phenomenon had become a sort of cult among the men of Fish. To observe, that was all; there remained in them none of the vital quality of illusion which would make them wonder or speculate, else a religion might have grown up around these mysterious visitations. But the men of Fish were beyond all religion—the barest and most savage tenets of even Christianity could gain no foothold on that barren rock—so there was no altar, no priest, no sacrifice; only each night at seven the silent concourse by the shanty depot, a congregation who lifted up a prayer of dim, anæmic wonder.

On this June night, the Great Brakeman, whom, had they deified any one, they might well have chosen as their celestial protagonist, had ordained that the seven o'clock train should leave its human (or inhuman) deposit at Fish. At two minutes after seven Percy Washington and John T. Unger disembarked, hurried past the spellbound, the agape, the fearsome eyes of the twelve men of Fish, mounted into a buggy which had obviously appeared from nowhere, and drove away.

After half an hour, when the twilight had coagulated into dark, the silent negro who was driving the buggy hailed an opaque body somewhere ahead of them in the gloom. In response to his cry, it turned upon them a luminous disc which regarded them like a malignant eye out of the unfathomable night. As they came closer, John saw that it was the tail-light of an immense automobile, larger and more magnificent than any he had ever seen. Its body was of gleaming metal richer than nickel and lighter than silver, and the hubs of the wheels were studded with iridescent geometric figures of green and yellow—John did not dare to guess whether they were glass or jewel.

Two negroes, dressed in glittering livery such as one sees in pictures of royal processions in London, were standing at attention beside the car and, as the two young men dismounted from the buggy, they were greeted in some language which the guest could not understand, but which seemed to be an extreme form of the Southern negro's dialect.

“Get in,” said Percy to his friend, as their trunks were tossed to the ebony roof of the limousine. “Sorry we had to bring you this far in that buggy, but of course it wouldn't do for the people on the train or those God-forsaken fellas in Fish to see this automobile.”

“Gosh! What a car!” This ejaculation was provoked by its interior. John saw that the upholstery consisted of a thousand minute and exquisite tapestries of silk, woven with jewels and embroideries, and set upon a background of cloth of gold. The two armchair seats in which the boys luxuriated were covered with stuff that resembled duvetyn, but seemed woven in numberless colors of the ends of ostrich feathers.

“What a car!” cried John again, in amazement.

“This thing?” Percy laughed. “Why, it's just an old junk we use for a station wagon.”

By this time they were gliding along through the darkness toward the break between the two mountains.

“We'll be there in an hour and a half,” said Percy, looking at the clock. “I may as well tell you it's not going to be like anything you ever saw before.”

If the car was any indication of what John would see, he was prepared to be astonished indeed. The simple piety prevalent in Hades has the earnest worship of and respect for riches as the first article of its creed—had John felt otherwise than radiantly humble before them, his parents would have turned away in horror at the blasphemy.

They had now reached and were entering the break between the two mountains and almost immediately the way became much rougher.

“If the moon shone down here, you'd see that we're in a big gulch,” said Percy, trying to peer out of the window. He spoke a few words into the mouthpiece and immediately the footman turned on a search-light and swept the hillsides with an immense beam.

“Rocky, you see. An ordinary car would be knocked to pieces in half an hour. In fact, it'd take a tank to navigate it unless you knew the way. You notice we're going uphill now.”

They were obviously ascending, and within a few minutes the car was crossing a high rise, where they caught a glimpse of a pale moon newly risen in the distance. The car stopped suddenly and several figures took shape out of the dark beside it—these were negroes also. Again the two young men were saluted in the same dimly recognisable dialect; then the negroes set to work and four immense cables dangling from overhead were attached with hooks to the hubs of the great jewelled wheels. At a resounding“Hey-yah!” John felt the car being lifted slowly from the ground—up and up—clear of the tallest rocks on both sides—then higher, until he could see a wavy, moonlit valley stretched out before him in sharp contrast to the quagmire of rocks that they had just left. Only on one side was there still rock—and then suddenly there was no rock beside them or anywhere around.

It was apparent that they had surmounted some immense knife-blade of stone, projecting perpendicularly into the air. In a moment they were going down again, and finally with a soft bump they were landed upon the smooth earth.

“The worst is over,” said Percy, squinting out the window. “It's only five miles from here, and our own road—tapestry brick—all the way. This belongs to us. This is where the United States ends, father says.”

“Are we in Canada?”

“We are not. We're in the middle of the Montana Rockies. But you are now on the only five square miles of land in the country that's never been surveyed.”

“Why hasn't it? Did they forget it?”

“No,” said Percy, grinning, “they tried to do it three times. The first time my grandfather corrupted a whole department of the State survey; the second time he had the official maps of the United States tinkered with—that held them for fifteen years. The last time was harder. My father fixed it so that their compasses were in the strongest magnetic field ever artificially set up. He had a whole set of surveying instruments made with a slight defection that would allow for this territory not to appear, and he substituted them for the ones that were to be used. Then he had a river deflected and he had what looked like a village up on its banks—so that they'd see it, and think it was a town ten miles farther up the valley. There's only one thing my father's afraid of,” he concluded, “only one thing in the world that could be used to find us out.”

“What's that?”

Percy sank his voice to a whisper.

“Aeroplanes,” he breathed. “We've got half a dozen anti-aircraft guns and we've arranged it so far—but there've been a few deaths and a great many prisoners. Not that we mind that, you know, father and I, but it upsets mother and the girls, and there's always the chance that some time we won't be able to arrange it.”

Shreds and tatters of chinchilla, courtesy clouds in the green moon's heaven, were passing the green moon like precious Eastern stuffs paraded for the inspection of some Tartar Khan. It seemed to John that it was day, and that he was looking at some lads sailing above him in the air, showering down tracts and patent medicine circulars, with their messages of hope for despairing, rock-bound hamlets. It seemed to him that he could see them look down out of the clouds and stare—and stare at whatever there was to stare at in this place whither he was bound—What then? Were they induced to land by some insidious device to be immured far from patent medicines and from tracts until the judgment day—or, should they fail to fall into the trap, did a quick puff of smoke and the sharp round of a splitting shell bring them drooping to earth—and“upset”Percy's mother and sisters. John shook his head and the wraith of a hollow laugh issued silently from his parted lips. What desperate transaction lay hidden here? What a moral expedient of a bizarre Croesus? What terrible and golden mystery?…

The chinchilla clouds had drifted past now and, outside the Montana night was bright as day the tapestry brick of the road was smooth to the tread of the great tyres as they rounded a still, moonlit lake; they passed into darkness for a moment, a pine grove, pungent and cool, then they came out into a broad avenue of lawn, and John's exclamation of pleasure was simultaneous with Percy's taciturn“We're home.”

Full in the light of the stars, an exquisite château rose from the borders of the lake, climbed in marble radiance half the height of an adjoining mountain, then melted in grace, in perfect symmetry, in translucent feminine languor, into the massed darkness of a forest of pine. The many towers, the slender tracery of the sloping parapets, the chiselled wonder of a thousand yellow windows with their oblongs and hectagons and triangles of golden light, the shattered softness of the intersecting planes of star-shine and blue shade, all trembled on John's spirit like a chord of music. On one of the towers, the tallest, the blackest at its base, an arrangement of exterior lights at the top made a sort of floating fairyland—and as John gazed up in warm enchantment the faint acciaccare sound of violins drifted down in a rococo harmony that was like nothing he had ever beard before. Then in a moment the car stepped before wide, high marble steps around which the night air was fragrant with a host of flowers. At the top of the steps two great doors swung silently open and amber light flooded out upon the darkness, silhouetting the figure of an exquisite lady with black, high-piled hair, who held out her arms toward them.

“Mother,” Percy was saying, “this is my friend, John Unger, from Hades.”

Afterward John remembered that first night as a daze of many colors, of quick sensory impressions, of music soft as a voice in love, and of the beauty of things, lights and shadows, and motions and faces. There was a white-haired man who stood drinking a many-hued cordial from a crystal thimble set on a golden stem. There was a girl with a flowery face, dressed like Titania with braided sapphires in her hair. There was a room where the solid, soft gold of the walls yielded to the pressure of his hand, and a room that was like a platonic conception of the ultimate prison—ceiling, floor, and all, it was lined with an unbroken mass of diamonds, diamonds of every size and shape, until, lit with tail violet lamps in the corners, it dazzled the eyes with a whiteness that could be compared only with itself, beyond human wish, or dream.

Through a maze of these rooms the two boys wandered. Sometimes the floor under their feet would flame in brilliant patterns from lighting below, patterns of barbaric clashing colors, of pastel delicacy, of sheer whiteness, or of subtle and intricate mosaic, surely from some mosque on the Adriatic Sea. Sometimes beneath layers of thick crystal he would see blue or green water swirling, inhabited by vivid fish and growths of rainbow foliage. Then they would be treading on furs of every texture and color or along corridors of palest ivory, unbroken as though carved complete from the gigantic tusks of dinosaurs extinct before the age of man.…

Then a hazily remembered transition, and they were at dinner—where each plate was of two almost imperceptible layers of solid diamond between which was curiously worked a filigree of emerald design, a shaving sliced from green air. Music, plangent and unobtrusive, drifted down through far corridors—his chair, feathered and curved insidiously to his back, seemed to engulf and overpower him as he drank his first glass of port. He tried drowsily to answer a question that had been asked him, but the honeyed luxury that clasped his body added to the illusion of sleep—jewels, fabrics, wines, and metals blurred before his eyes into a sweet mist.…

“Yes,” he replied with a polite effort, “it certainly is hot enough for me down there.”

He managed to add a ghostly laugh; then, without movement, without resistance, he seemed to float off and away, leaving an iced dessert that was pink as a dream.…He fell asleep.

When he awoke he knew that several hours had passed. He was in a great quiet room with ebony walls and a dull illumination that was too faint, too subtle, to be called a light. His young host was standing over him.

“You fell asleep at dinner,” Percy was saying. “I nearly did, too—it was such a treat to be comfortable again after this year of school. Servants undressed and bathed you while you were sleeping.”

“Is this a bed or a cloud?” sighed John. “Percy, Percy—before you go, I want to apologise.”

“For what?”

“For doubting you when you said you had a diamond as big as the Ritz-Carlton Hotel.”

Percy smiled.

“I thought you didn't believe me. It's that mountain, you know.”

“What mountain?”

“The mountain the château rests on. It's not very big, for a mountain. But except about fifty feet of sod and gravel on top it's solid diamond. One diamond, one cubic mile without a flaw. Aren't you listening? Say—”

But John T. Unger had again fallen asleep.





III


Morning. As he awoke he perceived drowsily that the room had at the same moment become dense with sunlight. The ebony panels of one wall had slid aside on a sort of track, leaving his chamber half open to the day. A large negro in a white uniform stood beside his bed.

“Good-evening,” muttered John, summoning his brains from the wild places.

“Good-morning, sir. Are you ready for your bath, sir? Oh, don't get up—I'll put you in, if you'll just unbutton your pyjamas—there. Thank you, sir.”

John lay quietly as his pyjamas were removed—he was amused and delighted; he expected to be lifted like a child by this black Gargantua who was tending him, but nothing of the sort happened; instead he felt the bed tilt up slowly on its side—he began to roll, startled at first, in the direction of the wall, but when he reached the wall its drapery gave way, and sliding two yards farther down a fleecy incline he plumped gently into water the same temperature as his body.

He looked about him. The runway or rollway on which he had arrived had folded gently back into place. He had been projected into another chamber and was sitting in a sunken bath with his head just above the level of the floor. All about him, lining the walls of the room and the sides and bottom of the bath itself, was a blue aquarium, and gazing through the crystal surface on which he sat, he could see fish swimming among amber lights and even gliding without curiosity past his outstretched toes, which were separated from them only by the thickness of the crystal. From overhead, sunlight came down through sea-green glass.

“I suppose, sir, that you'd like hot rosewater and soapsuds this morning, sir—and perhaps cold salt water to finish.”

The negro was standing beside him.

“Yes,” agreed John, smiling inanely, “as you please.” Any idea of ordering this bath according to his own meagre standards of living would have been priggish and not a little wicked.

The negro pressed a button and a warm rain began to fall, apparently from overhead, but really, so John discovered after a moment, from a fountain arrangement near by. The water turned to a pale rose color and jets of liquid soap spurted into it from four miniature walrus heads at the corners of the bath. In a moment a dozen little paddle-wheels, fixed to the sides, had churned the mixture into a radiant rainbow of pink foam which enveloped him softly with its delicious lightness, and burst in shining, rosy bubbles here and there about him.

“Shall I turn on the moving-picture machine, sir?” suggested the negro deferentially. “There's a good one-reel comedy in this machine to-day, or I can put in a serious piece in a moment, if you prefer it.”

“No, thanks,” answered John, politely but firmly. He was enjoying his bath too much to desire any distraction. But distraction came. In a moment he was listening intently to the sound of flutes from just outside, flutes dripping a melody that was like a waterfall, cool and green as the room itself, accompanying a frothy piccolo, in play more fragile than the lace of suds that covered and charmed him.

After a cold salt-water bracer and a cold fresh finish, he stepped out and into a fleecy robe, and upon a couch covered with the same material he was rubbed with oil, alcohol, and spice. Later he sat in a voluptuous while he was shaved and his hair was trimmed.

“Mr. Percy is waiting in your sitting-room,” said the negro, when these operations were finished. “My name is Gygsum, Mr. Unger, sir. I am to see to Mr. Unger every morning.”

John walked out into the brisk sunshine of his living-room, where he found breakfast waiting for him and Percy, gorgeous in white kid knickerbockers, smoking in an easy chair.





IV


This is a story of the Washington family as Percy sketched it for John during breakfast.

The father of the present Mr. Washington had been a Virginian, a direct descendant of George Washington, and Lord Baltimore. At the close of the Civil War he was a twenty-five-year-old Colonel with a played-out plantation and about a thousand dollars in gold.

Fitz-Norman Culpepper Washington, for that was the young Colonel's name, decided to present the Virginia estate to his younger brother and go West. He selected two dozen of the most faithful blacks, who, of course, worshipped him, and bought twenty-five tickets to the West, where he intended to take out land in their names and start a sheep and cattle ranch.

When he had been in Montana for less than a month and things were going very poorly indeed, he stumbled on his great discovery. He had lost his way when riding in the hills, and after a day without food he began to grow hungry. As he was without his rifle, he was forced to pursue a squirrel, and, in the course of the pursuit, he noticed that it was carrying something shiny in its mouth. Just before it vanished into its hole—for Providence did not intend that this squirrel should alleviate his hunger—it dropped its burden. Sitting down to consider the situation Fitz-Norman's eye was caught by a gleam in the grass beside him. In ten seconds he had completely lost his appetite and gained one hundred thousand dollars. The squirrel, which had refused with annoying persistence to become food, had made him a present of a large and perfect diamond.

Late that night he found his way to camp and twelve hours later all the males among his darkies were back by the squirrel hole digging furiously at the side of the mountain. He told them he had discovered a rhinestone mine, and, as only one or two of them had ever seen even a small diamond before, they believed him, without question. When the magnitude of his discovery became apparent to him, he found himself in a quandary. The mountain was a diamond—it was literally nothing else but solid diamond. He filled four saddle bags full of glittering samples and started on horseback for St. Paul. There he managed to dispose of half a dozen small stones—when he tried a larger one a storekeeper fainted and Fitz-Norman was arrested as a public disturber. He escaped from jail and caught the train for New York, where he sold a few medium-sized diamonds and received in exchange about two hundred thousand dollars in gold. But he did not dare to produce any exceptional gems—in fact, he left New York just in time. Tremendous excitement had been created in jewellery circles, not so much by the size of his diamonds as by their appearance in the city from mysterious sources. Wild rumours became current that a diamond mine had been discovered in the Catskills, on the Jersey coast, on Long Island, beneath Washington Square. Excursion trains, packed with men carrying picks and shovels, began to leave New York hourly, bound for various neighbouring El Dorados. But by that time young Fitz-Norman was on his way back to Montana.

By the end of a fortnight he had estimated that the diamond in the mountain was approximately equal in quantity to all the rest of the diamonds known to exist in the world. There was no valuing it by any regular computation, however, for it was one solid diamond—and if it were offered for sale not only would the bottom fall out of the market, but also, if the value should vary with its size in the usual arithmetical progression, there would not be enough gold in the world to buy a tenth part of it. And what could any one do with a diamond that size?

It was an amazing predicament. He was, in one sense, the richest man that ever lived—and yet was he worth anything at all? If his secret should transpire there was no telling to what measures the Government might resort in order to prevent a panic, in gold as well as in jewels. They might take over the claim immediately and institute a monopoly.

There was no alternative—he must market his mountain in secret. He sent South for his younger brother and put him in charge of his colored following, darkies who had never realised that slavery was abolished. To make sure of this, he read them a proclamation that he had composed, which announced that General Forrest had reorganised the shattered Southern armies and defeated the North in one pitched battle. The negroes believed him implicitly. They passed a vote declaring it a good thing and held revival services immediately.

Fitz-Norman himself set out for foreign parts with one hundred thousand dollars and two trunks filled with rough diamonds of all sizes. He sailed for Russia in a Chinese junk, and six months after his departure from Montana he was in St. Petersburg. He took obscure lodgings and called immediately upon the court jeweller, announcing that he had a diamond for the Czar. He remained in St. Petersburg for two weeks, in constant danger of being murdered, living from lodging to lodging, and afraid to visit his trunks more than three or four times during the whole fortnight.

On his promise to return in a year with larger and finer stones, he was allowed to leave for India. Before he left, however, the Court Treasurers had deposited to his credit, in American banks, the sum of fifteen million dollars—under four different aliases.

He returned to America in 1868, having been gone a little over two years. He had visited the capitals of twenty-two countries and talked with five emperors, eleven kings, three princes, a shah, a khan, and a sultan. At that time Fitz-Norman estimated his own wealth at one billion dollars. One fact worked consistently against the disclosure of his secret. No one of his larger diamonds remained in the public eye for a week before being invested with a history of enough fatalities, amours, revolutions, and wars to have occupied it from the days of the first Babylonian Empire.

From 1870 until his death in 1900, the history of Fitz-Norman Washington was a long epic in gold. There were side issues, of course—he evaded the surveys, he married a Virginia lady, by whom he had a single son, and he was compelled, due to a series of unfortunate complications, to murder his brother, whose unfortunate habit of drinking himself into an indiscreet stupor had several times endangered their safety. But very other murders stained these happy years of progress and exspansion.

Just before he died he changed his policy, and with all but a few million dollars of his outside wealth bought up rare minerals in bulk, which he deposited in the safety vaults of banks all over the world, marked as bric-à-brac. His son, Braddock Tarleton Washington, followed this policy on an even more tensive scale. The minerals were converted into the rarest of all elements—radium—so that the equivalent of a billion dollars in gold could be placed in a receptacle no bigger than a cigar box.

When Fitz-Norman had been dead three years his son, Braddock, decided that the business had gone far enough. The amount of wealth that he and his father had taken out of the mountain was beyond all exact computation. He kept a note-book in cipher in which he set down the approximate quantity of radium in each of the thousand banks he patronized, and recorded the alias under which it was held. Then he did a very simple thing—he sealed up the mine.

He sealed up the mine. What had been taken out of it would suppor tall the Washingtons yet to be born in unparalleled luxury for generations. His one care must be the protection of his secret, lest in the possible panic attendant on its discovery he should be reduced with all the property-holders in the world to utter poverty.

This was the family among whom John T. Unger was staying. This was the story he heard in his silver-walled living-room the morning after his arrival.





V


After breakfast, John found his way out the great marble entrance, and looked curiously at the scene before him. The whole valley, from the diamond mountain to the steep granite cliff five miles away, still gave off a breath of golden haze which hovered idly above the fine sweep of lawns and lakes and gardens. Here and there clusters of elms made delicate groves of shade, contrasting strangely with the tough masses of pine forest that held the hills in a grip of dark-blue green. Even as John looked he saw three fawns in single file patter out from one clump about a half-mile away and disappear with awkward gaiety into the black-ribbed half-light of another. John would not have been surprised to see a goat-foot piping his way among the trees or to catch a glimpse of pink nymph-skin and flying yellow hair between the greenest of the green leaves.

In some such cool hope he descended the marble steps, disturbing faintly the sleep of two silky Russian wolfhounds at the bottom, and set off along a walk of white and blue brick that seemed to lead in no particular direction.

He was enjoying himself as much as he was able. It is youth's felicity as well as its insufficiency that it can never live in the present, but must always be measuring up the day against its own radiantly imagined future—flowers and gold, girls and stars, they are only prefigurations and prophecies of that incomparable, unattainable young dream.

John rounded a soft corner where the massed rosebushes filled the air with heavy scent, and struck off across a park toward a patch of moss under some trees. He had never lain upon moss, and he wanted to see whether it was really soft enough to justify the use of its name as an adjective. Then he saw a girl coming toward him over the grass. She was the most beautiful person he had ever seen.

She was dressed in a white little gown that came just below her knees, and a wreath of mignonettes clasped with blue slices of sapphire bound up her hair. Her pink bare feet scattered the dew before them as she came. She was younger than John—not more than sixteen.

“Hello,” she cried softly, “I'm Kismine.”

She was much more than that to John already. He advanced toward her, scarcely moving as he drew near lest he should tread on her bare toes.

“You haven't met me,” said her soft voice. Her blue eyes added, “Oh, but you've missed a great deal!” …“You met my sister, Jasmine, last night. I was sick with lettuce poisoning,” went on her soft voice, and her eye continued, “and when I'm sick I'm sweet—and when I'm well.”

“You have made an enormous impression on me,” said John's eyes, “and I'm not so slow myself”—“How do you do?” said his voice. “I hope you're better this morning.” —“You darling,” added his eyes tremulously.

John observed that they had been walking along the path. On her suggestion they sat down together upon the moss, the softness of which he failed to determine.

He was critical about women. A single defect—a thick ankle, a hoarse voice, a glass eye—was enough to make him utterly indifferent. And here for the first time in his life he was beside a girl who seemed to him the incarnation of physical perfection.

“Are you from the East?” asked Kismine with charming interest.

“No,” answered John simply. “I'm from Hades.”

Either she had never heard of Hades, or she could think of no pleasant comment to make upon it, for she did not discuss it further.

“I'm going East to school this fall,” she said. “D'you think I'll like it? I'm going to New York to Miss Bulge's. It's very strict, but you see over the weekends I'm going to live at home with the family in our New York house, because father heard that the girls had to go walking two by two.”

“Your father wants you to be proud,” observed John.

“We are,” she answered, her eyes shining with dignity. “None of us has ever been punished. Father said we never should be. Once when my sister Jasmine was a little girl she pushed him downstairs and he just got up and limped away.”

“Mother was—well, a little startled,” continued Kismine, “when she heard that you were from—from where you are from, you know. She said that when she was a young girl—but then, you see, she's a Spaniard and old-fashioned.”

“Do you spend much time out here?” asked John, to conceal the fact that he was somewhat hurt by this remark. It seemed an unkind allusion to his provincialism.

“Percy and Jasmine and I are here every summer, but next summer Jasmine is going to Newport. She's coming out in London a year from this fall. She'll be presented at court.”

“Do you know,” began John hesitantly, “you're much more sophisticated than I thought you were when I first saw you?”

“Oh, no, I'm not,” she exclaimed hurriedly. “Oh, I wouldn't think of being. I think that sophisticated young people are terribly common, don't you? I'm not all, really. If you say I am, I'm going to cry.”

She was so distressed that her lip was trembling. John was impelled to protest:

“I didn't mean that; I only said it to tease you.”

“Because I wouldn't mind if I were,” she persisted, “but I'm not. I'm very innocent and girlish. I never smoke, or drink, or read anything except poetry. I know scarcely any mathematics or chemistry. I dress very simply—in fact, I scarcely dress at all. I think sophisticated is the last thing you can say about me. I believe that girls ought to enjoy their youths in a wholesome way.”

“I do, too,” said John, heartily,

Kismine was cheerful again. She smiled at him, and a still-born tear dripped from the comer of one blue eye.

“I like you,” she whispered intimately. “Are you going to spend all your time with Percy while you're here, or will you be nice to me? Just think—I'm absolutely fresh ground. I've never had a boy in love with me in all my life. I've never been allowed even to see boys alone—except Percy. I came all the way out here into this grove hoping to run into you, where the family wouldn't be around.”

Deeply flattered, John bowed from the hips as he had been taught at dancing school in Hades.

“We'd better go now,” said Kismine sweetly. “I have to be with mother at eleven. You haven't asked me to kiss you once. I thought boys always did that nowadays.”

John drew himself up proudly.

“Some of them do,” he answered, “but not me. Girls don't do that sort of thing—in Hades.”

Side by side they walked back toward the house.





VI


John stood facing Mr. Braddock Washington in the full sunlight. The elder man was about forty, with a proud, vacuous face, intelligent eyes, and a robust figure. In the mornings he smelt of horses—the best horses. He carried a plain walking-stick of gray birch with a single large opal for a grip. He and Percy were showing John around.

“The slaves' quarters are there.” His walking-stick indicated a cloister of marble on their left that ran in graceful Gothic along the side of the mountain. “In my youth I was distracted for a while from the business of life by a period of absurd idealism. During that time they lived in luxury. For instance, I equipped every one of their rooms with a tile bath.”

“I suppose,” ventured John, with an ingratiating laugh, “that they used the bathtubs to keep coal in. Mr. Schnlitzer-Murphy told me that once he—”

“The opinions of Mr. Schnlitzer-Murphy are of little importance, I should imagine,” interrupted Braddock Washington coldly. “My slaves did not keep coal in their bathtubs. They had orders to bathe every day, and they did. If they hadn't I might have ordered a sulphuric acid shampoo. I discontinued the baths for quite another reason. Several of them caught cold and died. Water is not good for certain races—except as a beverage.” John laughed, and then decided to nod his head in sober agreement. Braddock Washington made him uncomfortable.

“All these negroes are descendants of the ones my father brought North with him. There are about two hundred and fifty now. You notice that they've lived so long apart from the world that their original dialect has become an almost indistinguishable patois. We bring a few of them up to speak English—my secretary and two or three of the house servants.

“This is the golf course,” he continued, as they strolled along the velvet winter grass. “It's all a green, you see—no fairway, no rough, no hazards.”

He smiled pleasantly at John.

“Many men in the cage, father?” asked Percy suddenly.

Braddock Washington stumbled, and let forth an involuntary curse.

“One less than there should be,” he ejaculated darkly—and then added after a moment, “We've had difficulties.”

“Mother was telling me,” exclaimed Percy, “that Italian teacher—”

“A ghastly error,” said Braddock Washington angrily. “But of course there's a good chance that we may have got him. Perhaps he fell somewhere in the woods or stumbled over a cliff. And then there's always the probability that if he did get away his story wouldn't be believed. Nevertheless, I've had two dozen men looking for him in different towns around here.”

“And no luck?”

“Some. Fourteen of them reported to my agent they'd each killed a man answering to that description, but of course it was probably only the reward they were after—”

He broke off. They had come to a large cavity in the earth about the circumference of a merry-go-round, and covered by a strong iron grating. Braddock Washington beckoned to John, and pointed his cane down through the grating. John stepped to the edge and gazed. Immediately his ears were assailed by a wild clamor from below.

“Come on down to Hell!”

“Hello, kiddo, how's the air up there?”

“Hey! Throw us a rope!”

“Got an old doughnut, Buddy, or a couple of second-hand sandwiches?”

“Say, fella, if you'll push down that guy you're with, we'll show you a quick disappearance scene.”

“Paste him one for me, will you?”

It was too dark to see clearly into the pit below, but John could tell from the coarse optimism and rugged vitality of the remarks and voices that they proceeded from middle-class Americans of the more spirited type. Then Mr. Washington put out his cane and touched a button in the grass, and the scene below sprang into light.

“These are some adventurous mariners who had the misfortune to discover El Dorado,” he remarked.

Below them there had appeared a large hollow in the earth shaped like the interior of a bowl. The sides were steep and apparently of polished glass, and on its slightly concave surface stood about two dozen men clad in the half costume, half uniform, of aviators. Their up-turned faces, lit with wrath, with malice, with despair, with cynical humour, were covered by long growths of beard, but with the exception of a few who had pined perceptibly away, they seemed to be a well-fed, healthy lot.

Braddock Washington drew a garden chair to the edge of the pit and sat down.

“Well, how are you, boys?” he inquired genially.

A chorus of execration, in which all joined except a few too dispirited to cry out, rose up into the sunny air, but Braddock Washington heard it with unruffled composure. When its last echo had died away he spoke again.

“Have you thought up a way out of your difficulty?”

From here and there among them a remark floated up.

“We decided to stay here for love!”

“Bring us up there and we'll find us a way!”

Braddock Washington waited until they were again quiet. Then he said:

“I've told you the situation. I don't want you here, I wish to heaven I'd never seen you. Your own curiosity got you here, and any time that you can think of a way out which protects me and my interests I'll be glad to consider it. But so long as you confine your efforts to digging tunnels—yes, I know about the new one you've started—you won't get very far. This isn't as hard on you as you make it out, with all your howling for the loved ones at home. If you were the type who worried much about the loved ones at home, you'd never have taken up aviation.”

A tall man moved apart from the others, and held up his hand to call his captor's attention to what he was about to say.

“Let me ask you a few questions!” he cried. “You pretend to be a fair-minded man.”

“How absurd. How could a man of my position be fair-minded toward you? You might as well speak of a Spaniard being fair-minded toward a piece of steak.”

At this harsh observation the faces of the two dozen fell, but the tall man continued:

“All right!” he cried. “We've argued this out before. You're not a humanitarian and you're not fair-minded, but you're human—at least you say you are—and you ought to be able to put yourself in our place for long enough to think how—how—how—”

“How what?” demanded Washington, coldly.

“—how unnecessary—”

“Not to me.”

“Well—how cruel—”

“We've covered that. Cruelty doesn't exist where self-preservation is involved. You've been soldiers; you know that. Try another.”

“Well, then, how stupid.”

“There,” admitted Washington, “I grant you that. But try to think of an alternative. I've offered to have all or any of you painlessly executed if you wish. I've offered to have your wives, sweethearts, children, and mothers kidnapped and brought out here. I'll enlarge your place down there and feed and clothe you the rest of your lives. If there was some method of producing permanent amnesia I'd have all of you operated on and released immediately, somewhere outside of my preserves. But that's as far as my ideas go.”

“How about trusting us not to peach on you?” cried some one.

“You don't proffer that suggestion seriously,” said Washington, with an expression of scorn. “I did take out one man to teach my daughter Italian. Last week he got away.”

A wild yell of jubilation went up suddenly from two dozen throats and a pandemonium of joy ensued. The prisoners clog-danced and cheered and yodled and wrestled with one another in a sudden uprush of animal spirits. They even ran up the glass sides of the bowl as far as they could, and slid back to the bottom upon the natural cushions of their bodies. The tall man started a song in which they all joined—

“Oh, we'll hang the kaiser

On a sour apple-tree—”

Braddock Washington sat in inscrutable silence until the song was over.

“You see,” he remarked, when he could gain a modicum of attention. “I bear you no ill-will. I like to see you enjoying yourselves. That's why I didn't tell you the whole story at once. The man—what was his name? Critchtichiello?—was shot by some of my agents in fourteen different places.”

Not guessing that the places referred to were cities, the tumult of rejoicing subsided immediately.

“Nevertheless,” cried Washington with a touch of anger, “he tried to run away. Do you expect me to take chances with any of you after an experience like that?”

Again a series of ejaculations went up.

“Sure!”

“Would your daughter like to learn Chinese?”

“Hey, I can speak Italian! My mother was a wop.”

“Maybe she'd like t'learna speak N'Yawk!”

“If she's the little one with the big blue eyes I can teach her a lot of things better than Italian.”

“I know some Irish songs—and I could hammer brass once't.”

Mr. Washington reached forward suddenly with his cane and pushed the button in the grass so that the picture below went out instantly, and there remained only that great dark mouth covered dismally with the black teeth of the grating.

“Hey!” called a single voice from below, “you ain't goin' away without givin' us your blessing?”

But Mr. Washington, followed by the two boys, was already strolling on toward the ninth hole of the golf course, as though the pit and its contents were no more than a hazard over which his facile iron had triumphed with ease.

July under the lee of the diamond mountain was a month of blanket nights and of warm, glowing days. John and Kismine were in love. He did not know that the little gold football (inscribed with the legend Pro deo et patria et St. Mida) which he had given her rested on a platinum chain next to her bosom. But it did. And she for her part was not aware that a large sapphire which had dropped one day from her simple coiffure was stowed away tenderly in John's jewel box.

Late one afternoon when the ruby and ermine music room was quiet, they spent an hour there together. He held her hand and she gave him such a look that he whispered her name aloud. She bent toward him—then hesitated.

“Did you say ‘Kismine’?” she asked softly, “or—”

She had wanted to be sure. She thought she might have misunderstood.

Neither of them had ever kissed before, but in the course of an hour it seemed to make little difference.

The afternoon drifted away. That night, when a last breath of music drifted down from the highest tower, they each lay awake, happily dreaming over the separate minutes of the day. They had decided to be married as soon as possible.





VIII


Every day Mr. Washington and the two young men went hunting or fishing in the deep forests or played golf around the somnolent course—games which John diplomatically allowed his host to win—or swam in the mountain coolness of the lake. John found Mr. Washington a somewhat exacting personality—utterly uninterested in any ideas or opinions except his own. Mrs. Washington was aloof and reserved at all times. She was apparently indifferent to her two daughters, and entirely absorbed in her son Percy, with whom she held interminable conversations in rapid Spanish at dinner.

Jasmine, the elder daughter, resembled Kismine in appearance—except that she was somewhat bow-legged, and terminated in large hands and feet—but was utterly unlike her in temperament. Her favourite books had to do with poor girls who kept house for widowed fathers. John learned from Kismine that Jasmine had never recovered from the shock and disappointment caused her by the termination of the World War, just as she was about to start for Europe as a canteen expert. She had even pined away for a time, and Braddock Washington had taken steps to promote a new war in the Balkans—but she had seen a photograph of some wounded Serbian soldiers and lost interest in the whole proceedings. But Percy and Kismine seemed to have inherited the arrogant attitude in all its harsh magnificence from their father. A chaste and consistent selfishness ran like a pattern through their every idea.

John was enchanted by the wonders of the château and the valley. Braddock Washington, so Percy told him, had caused to be kidnapped a landscape gardener, an architect, a designer of state settings, and a French decadent poet left over from the last century. He had put his entire force of negroes at their disposal, guaranteed to supply them with any materials that the world could offer, and left them to work out some ideas of their own. But one by one they had shown their uselessness. The decadent poet had at once begun bewailing his separation, from the boulevards in spring—he made some vague remarks about spices, apes, and ivories, but said nothing that was of any practical value. The stage designer on his part wanted to make the whole valley a series of tricks and sensational effects—a state of things that the Washingtons would soon have grown tired of. And as for the architect and the landscape gardener, they thought only in terms of convention. They must make this like this and that like that.

But they had, at least, solved the problem of what was to be done with them—they all went mad early one morning after spending the night in a single room trying to agree upon the location of a fountain, and were now confined comfortably in an insane asylum at Westport, Connecticut.

“But,” inquired John curiously, “who did plan all your wonderful reception rooms and halls, and approaches and bathrooms—?”

“Well,” answered Percy, “I blush to tell you, but it was a moving-picture fella. He was the only man we found who was used to playing with an unlimited amount of money, though he did tuck his napkin in his collar and couldn't read or write.”

As August drew to a close John began to regret that he must soon go back to school. He and Kismine had decided to elope the following June.

“It would be nicer to be married here,” Kismine confessed, “but of course I could never get father's permission to marry you at all. Next to that I'd rather elope. It's terrible for wealthy people to be married in America at present—they always have to send out bulletins to the press saying that they're going to be married in remnants, when what they mean is just a peck of old second-hand pearls and some used lace worn once by the Empress Eugénie.”

“I know,” agreed John fervently. “When I was visiting the Schnlitzer-Murphys, the eldest daughter, Gwendolyn, married a man whose father owns half of West Virginia. She wrote home saying what a tough struggle she was carrying on on his salary as a bank clerk—and then she ended up by saying that ‘Thank God, I have four good maids anyhow, and that helps a little.’”

“It's absurd,” commented Kismine. “Think of the millions and millions of people in the world, labourers and all, who get along with only two maids.”

One afternoon late in August a chance remark of Kismine's changed the face of the entire situation, and threw John into a state of terror.

They were in their favourite grove, and between kisses John was indulging in some romantic forebodings which he fancied added poignancy to their relations.

“Sometimes I think we'll never marry,” he said sadly. “You're too wealthy, too magnificent. No one as rich as you are can be like other girls. I should marry the daughter of some well-to-do wholesale hardware man from Omaha or Sioux City, and be content with her half-million.”

“I knew the daughter of a wholesale hardware man once,” remarked Kismine. “I don't think you'd have been contented with her. She was a friend of my sister's. She visited here.”

“Oh, then you've had other guests?” exclaimed John in surprise.

Kismine seemed to regret her words.

“Oh, yes,” she said hurriedly, “we've had a few.”

“But aren't you—wasn't your father afraid they'd talk outside?”

“Oh, to some extent, to some extent,” she answered. “Let's talk about something pleasanter.”

But John's curiosity was aroused.

“Something pleasanter!” he demanded. “What's unpleasant about that? Weren't they nice girls?”

To his great surprise Kismine began to weep.

“Yes—th—that's the—the whole t-trouble. I grew qu-quite attached to some of them. So did Jasmine, but she kept inv-viting them anyway. I couldn't understand it.”

A dark suspicion was born in John's heart.

“Do you mean that they told, and your father had them—removed?”

“Worse than that,” she muttered brokenly. “Father took no chances—and Jasmine kept writing them to come, and they had such a good time!”

She was overcome by a paroxysm of grief.

Stunned with the horror of this revelation, John sat there open-mouthed, feeling the nerves of his body twitter like so many sparrows perched upon his spinal column.

“Now, I've told you, and I shouldn't have,” she said, calming suddenly and drying her dark blue eyes.

“Do you mean to say that your father had them murdered before they left?”

She nodded.

“In August usually—or early in September. It's only natural for us to get all the pleasure out of them that we can first.”

“How abominable! How—why, I must be going crazy! Did you really admit that—”

“I did,” interrupted Kismine, shrugging her shoulders. “We can't very well imprison them like those aviators, where they'd be a continual reproach to us every day. And it's always been made easier for Jasmine and me, because father had it done sooner than we expected. In that way we avoided any farewell scene—”

“So you murdered them! Uh!” cried John.

“It was done very nicely. They were drugged while they were asleep—and their families were always told that they died of scarlet fever in Butte.”

“But—I fail to understand why you kept on inviting them!”

“I didn't,” burst out Kismine. “I never invited one. Jasmine did. And they always had a very good time. She'd give them the nicest presents toward the last. I shall probably have visitors too—I'll harden up to it. We can't let such an inevitable thing as death stand in the way of enjoying life while we have it. Think of how lonesome it'd be out here if we never had any one. Why, father and mother have sacrificed some of their best friends just as we have.”

“And so,” cried John accusingly, “and so you were letting me make love to you and pretending to return it, and talking about marriage, all the time knowing perfectly well that I'd never get out of here alive—”

“No,” she protested passionately. “Not any more. I did at first. You were here. I couldn't help that, and I thought your last days might as well be pleasant for both of us. But then I fell in love with you, and—and I'm honestly sorry you're going to—going to be put away—though I'd rather you'd be put away than ever kiss another girl.”

“Oh, you would, would you?” cried John ferociously.

“Much rather. Besides, I've always heard that a girl can have morefun with a man whom she knows she can never marry. Oh, why did I tell you? I've probably spoiled your whole good time now, and we were really enjoying things when you didn't know it. I knew it would make things sort of depressing for you.”

“Oh, you did, did you?” John's voice trembled with anger. “I've heard about enough of this. If you haven't any more pride and decency than to have an affair with a fellow that you know isn't much better than a corpse, I don't want to have any more to with you!”

“You're not a corpse!” she protested in horror. “You're not a corpse! I won't have you saying that I kissed a corpse!”

“I said nothing of the sort!”

“You did! You said I kissed a corpse!”

“I didn't!”

Their voices had risen, but upon a sudden interruption they both subsided into immediate silence. Footsteps were coming along the path in their direction, and a moment later the rose bushes were parted displaying Braddock Washington, whose intelligent eyes set in his good-looking vacuous face were peering in at them.

“Who kissed a corpse?” he demanded in obvious disapproval.

“Nobody,” answered Kismine quickly. “We were just joking.”

“What are you two doing here, anyhow?” he demanded gruffly. “Kismine, you ought to be—to be reading or playing golf with your sister. Go read! Go play golf! Don't let me find you here when I come back!”

Then he bowed at John and went up the path.

“See?” said Kismine crossly, when he was out of hearing. “You've spoiled it all. We can never meet any more. He won't let me meet you. He'd have you poisoned if he thought we were in love.”

“We're not, any more!” cried John fiercely, “so he can set his mind at rest upon that. Moreover, don't fool yourself that I'm going to stay around here. Inside of six hours I'll be over those mountains, if I have to gnaw a passage through them, and on my way East.”

They had both got to their feet, and at this remark Kismine came close and put her arm through his.

“I'm going, too.”

“You must be crazy—”

“Of course I'm going,” she interrupted impatiently.

“You most certainly are not. You—”

“Very well,” she said quietly, “we'll catch up with father and talk it over with him.”

Defeated, John mustered a sickly smile.

“Very well, dearest,” he agreed, with pale and unconvincing affection, “we'll go together.”

His love for her returned and settled placidly on his heart. She was his—she would go with him to share his dangers. He put his arms about her and kissed her fervently. After all she loved him; she had saved him, in fact.

Discussing the matter, they walked slowly back toward the château. They decided that since Braddock Washington had seen them together they had best depart the next night. Nevertheless, John's lips were unusually dry at dinner, and he nervously emptied a great spoonful of peacock soup into his left lung. He had to be carried into the turquoise and sable card-room and pounded on the back by one of the under-butlers, which Percy considered a great joke.





IX


Long after midnight John's body gave a nervous jerk, he sat suddenly upright, staring into the veils of somnolence that draped the room. Through the squares of blue darkness that were his open windows, he had heard a faint far-away sound that died upon a bed of wind before identifying itself on his memory, clouded with uneasy dreams. But the sharp noise that had succeeded it was nearer, was just outside the room—the click of a turned knob, a footstep, a whisper, he could not tell; a hard lump gathered in the pit of his stomach, and his whole body ached in the moment that he strained agonisingly to hear. Then one of the veils seemed to dissolve, and he saw a vague figure standing by the door, a figure only faintly limned and blocked in upon the darkness, mingled so with the folds of the drapery as to seem distorted, like a reflection seen in a dirty pane of glass.

With a sudden movement of fright or resolution John pressed the button by his bedside, and the next moment he was sitting in the green sunken bath of the adjoining room, waked into alertness by the shock of the cold water which half filled it.

He sprang out, and, his wet pyjamas scattering a heavy trickle of water behind him, ran for the aquamarine door which he knew led out on to the ivory landing of the second floor. The door opened noiselessly. A single crimson lamp burning in a great dome above lit the magnificent sweep of the carved stairways with a poignant beauty. For a moment John hesitated, appalled by the silent splendour massed about him, seeming to envelop in its gigantic folds and contours the solitary drenched little figure shivering upon the ivory landing. Then simultaneously two things happened. The door of his own sitting-room swung open, precipitating three naked negroes into the hall—and, as John swayed in wild terror toward the stairway, another door slid back in the wall on the other side of the corridor, and John saw Braddock Washington standing in the lighted lift, wearing a fur coat and a pair of riding boots which reached to his knees and displayed, above, the glow of his rose-colored pajamas.

On the instant the three negroes—John had never seen any of them before, and it flashed through his mind that they must be the professional executioners paused in their movement toward John, and turned expectantly to the man in the lift, who burst out with an imperious command:

“Get in here! All three of you! Quick as hell!”

Then, within the instant, the three negroes darted into the cage, the oblong of light was blotted out as the lift door slid shut, and John was again alone in the hall. He slumped weakly down against an ivory stair.

It was apparent that something portentous had occurred, something which, for the moment at least, had postponed his own petty disaster. What was it? Had the negroes risen in revolt? Had the aviators forced aside the iron bars of the grating? Or had the men of Fish stumbled blindly through the hills and gazed with bleak, joyless eyes upon the gaudy valley? John did not know. He heard a faint whir of air as the lift whizzed up again, and then, a moment later, as it descended. It was probable that Percy was hurrying to his father's assistance, and it occurred to John that this was his opportunity to join Kismine and plan an immediate escape. He waited until the lift had been silent for several minutes; shivering a little with the night cool that whipped in through his wet pajamas, he returned to his room and dressed himself quickly. Then he mounted a long flight of stairs and turned down the corridor carpeted with Russian sable which led to Kismine's suite.

The door of her sitting-room was open and the lamps were lighted. Kismine, in an angora kimono, stood near the window Of the room in a listening attitude, and as John entered noiselessly she turned toward him.

“Oh, it's you!” she whispered, crossing the room to him. “Did you hear them?”

“I heard your father's slaves in my—”

“No,” she interrupted excitedly. “Aeroplanes!”

“Aeroplanes? Perhaps that was the sound that woke me.”

“There're at least a dozen. I saw one a few moments ago dead against the moon. The guard back by the cliff fired his rifle and that's what roused father. We're going to open on them right away.”

“Are they here on purpose?”

“Yes—it's that Italian who got away—”

Simultaneously with her last word, a succession of sharp cracks tumbled in through the open window. Kismine uttered a little cry, took a penny with fumbling fingers from a box on her dresser, and ran to one of the electric lights. In an instant the entire chateau was in darkness—she had blown out the fuse.

“Come on!” she cried to him. “We'll go up to the roof garden, and watch it from there!”

Drawing a cape about her, she took his hand, and they found their way out the door. It was only a step to the tower lift, and as she pressed the button that shot them upward he put his arms around her in the darkness and kissed her mouth. Romance had come to John Unger at last. A minute later they had stepped out upon the star-white platform. Above, under the misty moon, sliding in and out of the patches of cloud that eddied below it, floated a dozen dark-winged bodies in a constant circling course. From here and there in the valley flashes of fire leaped toward them, followed by sharp detonations. Kismine clapped her hands with pleasure, which, a moment later, turned to dismay as the aeroplanes, at some prearranged signal, began to release their bombs and the whole of the valley became a panorama of deep reverberate sound and lurid light.

Before long the aim of the attackers became concentrated upon the points where the anti-aircraft guns were situated, and one of them was almost immediately reduced to a giant cinder to lie smouldering in a park of rose bushes.

“Kismine,” begged John, “you'll be glad when I tell you that this attack came on the eve of my murder. If I hadn't heard that guard shoot off his gun back by the pass I should now be stone dead—”

“I can't hear you!” cried Kismine, intent on the scene before her. “You'll have to talk louder!”

“I simply said,” shouted John, “that we'd better get out before they begin to shell the château!”

Suddenly the whole portico of the negro quarters cracked asunder, a geyser of flame shot up from under the colonnades, and great fragments of jagged marble were hurled as far as the borders of the lake.

“There go fifty thousand dollars' worth of slaves,” cried Kismine, “at pre-war prices. So few Americans have any respect for property.”

John renewed his efforts to compel her to leave. The aim of the aeroplanes was becoming more precise minute by minute, and only two of the anti-aircraft guns were still retaliating. It was obvious that the garrison, encircled with fire, could not hold out much longer.

“Come on!” cried John, pulling Kismine's arm, “we've got to go. Do you realise that those aviators will kill you without question if they find you?”

She consented reluctantly.

“We'll have to wake Jasmine!” she said, as they hurried toward the lift. Then she added in a sort of childish delight: “We'll be poor, won't we? Like people in books. And I'll be an orphan and utterly free. Free and poor! What fun!” She stopped and raised her lips to him in a delighted kiss.

“It's impossible to be both together,” said John grimly. “People have found that out. And I should choose to be free as preferable of the two. As an extra caution you'd better dump the contents of your jewel box into your pockets.”

Ten minutes later the two girls met John in the dark corridor and they descended to the main floor of the château. Passing for the last time through the magnificence of the splendid halls, they stood for a moment out on the terrace, watching the burning negro quarters and the flaming embers of two planes which had fallen on the other side of the lake. A solitary gun was still keeping up a sturdy popping, and the attackers seemed timorous about descending lower, but sent their thunderous fireworks in a circle around it, until any chance shot might annihilate its Ethiopian crew.

John and the two sisters passed down the marble steps, turned sharply to the left, and began to ascend a narrow path that wound like a garter about the diamond mountain. Kismine knew a heavily wooded spot half-way up where they could lie concealed and yet be able to observe the wild night in the valley—finally to make an escape, when it should be necessary, along a secret path laid in a rocky gully.





X


It was three o'clock when they attained their destination. The obliging and phlegmatic Jasmine fell off to sleep immediately, leaning against the trunk of a large tree, while John and Kismine sat, his arm around her, and watched the desperate ebb and flow of the dying battle among the ruins of a vista that had been a garden spot that morning. Shortly after four o'clock the last remaining gun gave out a clanging sound, and went out of action in a swift tongue of red smoke. Though the moon was down, they saw that the flying bodies were circling closer to the earth. When the planes had made certain that the beleaguered possessed no further resources they would land and the dark and glittering reign of the Washingtons would be over.

With the cessation of the firing the valley grew quiet. The embers of the two aeroplanes glowed like the eyes of some monster crouching in the grass. The château stood dark and silent, beautiful without light as it had been beautiful in the sun, while the woody rattles of Nemesis filled the air above with a growing and receding complaint. Then John perceived that Kismine, like her sister, had fallen sound asleep.

It was long after four when he became aware of footsteps along the path they had lately followed, and he waited in breathless silence until the persons to whom they belonged had passed the vantage-point he occupied. There was a faint stir in the air now that was not of human origin, and the dew was cold; be knew that the dawn would break soon. John waited until the steps had gone a safe distance up the mountain and were inaudible. Then he followed. About half-way to the steep summit the trees fell away and a hard saddle of rock spread itself over the diamond beneath. Just before he reached this point he slowed down his pace warned by an animal sense that there was life just ahead of him. Coming to a high boulder, he lifted his head gradually above its edge. His curiosity was rewarded; this is what he saw:

Braddock Washington was standing there motionless, silhouetted against the gray sky without sound or sign of life. As the dawn came up out of the east, lending a gold green color to the earth, it brought the solitary figure into insignificant contrast with the new day,

While John watched, his host remained for a few moments absorbed in some inscrutable contemplation; then he signalled to the two negroes who crouched at his feet to lift the burden which lay between them. As they struggled upright, the first yellow beam of the sun struck through the innumerable prisms of an immense and exquisitely chiselled diamond—and a white radiance was kindled that glowed upon the air like a fragment of the morning star. The bearers staggered beneath its weight for a moment—then their rippling muscles caught and hardened under the wet shine of the skins and the three figures were again motionless in their defiant impotency before the heavens.

After a while the white man lifted his head and slowly raised his arms in a gesture of attention, as one who would call a great crowd to hear—but there was no crowd, only the vast silence of the mountain and the sky, broken by faint bird voices down among the trees. The figure on the saddle of rock began to speak ponderously and with an inextinguishable pride.

“You out there!” he cried in a trembling voice. “You—there—!” He paused, his arms still uplifted, his head held attentively as though he were expecting an answer. John strained his eyes to see whether there might be men coming down the mountain, but the mountain was bare of human life. There was only sky and a mocking flute of wind along the treetops. Could Washington be praying? For a moment John wondered. Then the illusion passed—there was something in the man's whole attitude antithetical to prayer.

“Oh, you above there!”

The voice was become strong and confident. This was no forlorn supplication. If anything, there was in it a quality of monstrous condescension.

“You there—”

Words, too quickly uttered to be understood, flowing one into the other.…John listened breathlessly, catching a phrase here and there, while the voice broke off, resumed, broke off again—now strong and argumentative, now colored with a slow, puzzled impatience, Then a conviction commenced to dawn on the single listener, and as realisation crept over him a spray of quick blood rushed through his arteries. Braddock Washington was offering a bribe to God!

That was it—there was no doubt. The diamond in the arms of his slaves was some advance sample, a promise of more to follow.

That, John perceived after a time, was the thread running through his sentences. Prometheus Enriched was calling to witness forgotten sacrifices, forgotten rituals, prayers obsolete before the birth of Christ. For a while his discourse took the farm of reminding God of this gift or that which Divinity had deigned to accept from men—great churches if he would rescue cities from the plague, gifts of myrrh and gold, of human lives and beautiful women and captive armies, of children and queens, of beasts of the forest and field, sheep and goats, harvests and cities, whole conquered lands that had been offered up in lust or blood for His appeasal, buying a meed's worth of alleviation from the Divine wrath—and now he, Braddock Washington, Emperor of Diamonds, king and priest of the age of gold, arbiter of splendour and luxury, would offer up a treasure such as princes before him had never dreamed of, offer it up not in suppliance, but in pride.

He would give to God, he continued, getting down to specifications, the greatest diamond in the world. This diamond would be cut with many more thousand facets than there were leaves on a tree, and yet the whole diamond would be shaped with the perfection of a stone no bigger than a fly. Many men would work upon it for many years. It would be set in a great dome of beaten gold, wonderfully carved and equipped with gates of opal and crusted sapphire. In the middle would be hollowed out a chapel presided over by an altar of iridescent, decomposing, ever-changing radium which would burn out the eyes of any worshipper who lifted up his head from prayer—and on this altar there would be slain for the amusement of the Divine Benefactor any victim He should choose, even though it should be the greatest and most powerful man alive.

In return he asked only a simple thing, a thing that for God would be absurdly easy—only that matters should be as they were yesterday at this hour and that they should so remain. So very simple! Let but the heavens open, swallowing these men and their aeroplanes—and then close again. Let him have his slaves once more, restored to life and well.

There was no one else with whom he had ever needed: to treat or bargain.

He doubted only whether he had made his bribe big enough. God had His price, of course. God was made in man's image, so it had been said: He must have His price. And the price would be rare—no cathedral whose building consumed many years, no pyramid constructed by ten thousand workmen, would be like this cathedral, this pyramid.

He paused here. That was his proposition. Everything would be up to specifications, and there was nothing vulgar in his assertion that it would be cheap at the price. He implied that Providence could take it or leave it.

As he approached the end his sentences became broken, became short and uncertain, and his body seemed tense, seemed strained to catch the slightest pressure or whisper of life in the spaces around him. His hair had turned gradually white as he talked, and now he lifted his head high to the heavens like a prophet of old—magnificently mad.

Then, as John stared in giddy fascination, it seemed to him that a curious phenomenon took place somewhere around him. It was as though the sky had darkened for an instant, as though there had been a sudden murmur in a gust of wind, a sound of far-away trumpets, a sighing like the rustle of a great silken robe—for a time the whole of nature round about partook of this darkness; the birds' song ceased; the trees were still, and far over the mountain there was a mutter of dull, menacing thunder.

That was all. The wind died along the tall grasses of the valley. The dawn and the day resumed their place in a time, and the risen sun sent hot waves of yellow mist that made its path bright before it. The leaves laughed in the sun, and their laughter shook until each bough was like a girl's school in fairyland. God had refused to accept the bribe.

For another moment John, watched the triumph of the day. Then, turning, he saw a flutter of brown down by the lake, then another flutter, then another, like the dance of golden angels alighting from the clouds. The aeroplanes had come to earth.

John slid off the boulder and ran down the side of the mountain to the clump of trees, where the two girls were awake and waiting for him. Kismine sprang to her feet, the jewels in her pockets jingling, a question on her parted lips, but instinct told John that there was no time for words. They must get off the mountain without losing a moment. He seized a hand of each, and in silence they threaded the tree-trunks, washed with light now and with the rising mist. Behind them from the valley came no sound at all, except the complaint of the peacocks far away and the pleasant of morning.

When they had gone about half a mile, they avoided the park land and entered a narrow path that led over the next rise of ground. At the highest point of this they paused and turned around. Their eyes rested upon the mountainside they had just left—oppressed by some dark sense of tragic impendency.

Clear against the sky a broken, white-haired man was slowly descending the steep slope, followed by two gigantic and emotionless negroes, who carried a burden between them which still flashed and glittered in the sun. Half-way down two other figures joined them—John could see that they were Mrs. Washington and her son, upon whose arm she leaned. The aviators had clambered from their machines to the sweeping lawn in front of the château, and with rifles in hand were starting up the diamond mountain in skirmishing formation.

But the little group of five which had formed farther up and was engrossing all the watchers' attention had stopped upon a ledge of rock. The negroes stooped and pulled up what appeared to be a trap-door in the side of the mountain. Into this they all disappeared, the white-haired man first, then his wife and son, finally the two negroes, the glittering tips of whose jewelled head-dresses caught the sun for a moment before the trap-door descended and engulfed them all.

Kismine clutched John's arm.

“Oh,” she cried wildly, “where are they going? What are they going to do?”

“It must be some underground way of escape—”

A little scream from the two girls interrupted his sentence.

“Don't you see?” sobbed Kismine hysterically. “The mountain is wired!”

Even as she spoke John put up his hands to shield his sight. Before their eyes the whole surface of the mountain had changed suddenly to a dazzling burning yellow, which showed up through the jacket of turf as light shows through a human hand. For a moment the intolerable glow continued, and then like an extinguished filament it disappeared, revealing a black waste from which blue smoke arose slowly, carrying off with it what remained of vegetation and of human flesh. Of the aviators there was left neither blood nor bone—they were consumed as completely as the five souls who had gone inside.

Simultaneously, and with an immense concussion, the château literally threw itself into the air, bursting into flaming fragments as it rose, and then tumbling back upon itself in a smoking pile that lay projecting half into the water of the lake. There was no fire—what smoke there was drifted off mingling with the sunshine, and for a few minutes longer a powdery dust of marble drifted from the great featureless pile that had once been the house of jewels. There was no more sound and the three people were alone in the valley.





XI


At sunset John and his two companions reached the huge cliff which had marked the boundaries of the Washington's dominion, and looking back found the valley tranquil and lovely in the dusk. They sat down to finish the food which Jasmine had brought with her in a basket,

“There!” she said, as she spread the table-cloth and put the sandwiches in a neat pile upon it. “Don't they look tempting? I always think that food tastes better outdoors.”

“With that remark,” remarked Kismine, “Jasmine enters the middle class.”

“Now,” said John eagerly, “turn out your pocket and let's see what jewels you brought along. If you made a good selection we three ought to live comfortably all the rest of our lives.”

Obediently Kismine put her hand in her pocket and tossed two handfuls of glittering stones before him.

“Not so bad,” cried John enthusiastically. “They aren't very big, but-Hello!” His expression changed as he held one of them up to the declining sun. “Why, these aren't diamonds! There's something the matter!”

“By golly!” exclaimed Kismine, with a startled look. “What an idiot I am!”

“Why, these are rhinestones!” cried John.

“I know.” She broke into a laugh. “I opened the wrong drawer. They belonged on the dress of a girl who visited Jasmine. I got her to give them to me in exchange for diamonds. I'd never seen anything but precious stones before.”

“And this is what you brought?”

“I'm afraid so.” She fingered the brilliants wistfully. “I think I like these better. I'm a little tired of diamonds.”

“Very well,” said John gloomily. “We'll have to live in Hades. And you will grow old telling incredulous women that you got the wrong drawer. Unfortunately, your father's bank-books were consumed with him.”

“Well, what's the matter with Hades?”

“If I come home with a wife at my age my father is just as liable as not to cut me off with a hot coal, as they say down there.”

Jasmine spoke up.

“I love washing,” she said quietly. “I have always washed my own handkerchiefs. I'll take in laundry and support you both.”

“Do they have washwomen in Hades?” asked Kismine innocently.

“Of course,” answered John. “It's just like anywhere else.”

“I thought—perhaps it was too hot to wear any clothes.”

John laughed.

“Just try it!” he suggested. “They'll run you out before you're half started.”

“Will father be there?” she asked.

John turned to her in astonishment.

“Your father is dead,” he replied sombrely. “Why should he go to Hades? You have it confused with another place that was abolished long ago.”

After supper they folded up the table-cloth and spread their blankets for the night.

“What a dream it was,” Kismine sighed, gazing up at the stars. “How strange it seems to be here with one dress and a penniless fiancé!”

“Under the stars,” she repeated. “I never noticed the stars before. I always thought of them as great big diamonds that belonged to some one. Now they frighten me. They make me feel that it was all a dream, all my youth.”

“It was a dream,” said John quietly. “Everybody's youth is a dream, a form of chemical madness.”

“How pleasant then to be insane!”

“So I'm told,” said John gloomily. “I don't know any longer. At anyrate, let us love for a while, for a year or so, you and me. That's a form of divine drunkenness that we can all try. There are only diamonds in the whole world, diamonds and perhaps the shabby gift of disillusion. Well, I have that last and I will make the usual nothing of it.” He shivered. “Turn up your coat collar, little girl, the night's full of chill and you'll get pneumonia. His was a great sin who first invented consciousness. Let us lose it for a few hours.”

So wrapping himself in his blanket he fell off to sleep.





WINTER DREAMS


I


Some of the caddies were poor as sin and lived in one-room houses with a neurasthenic cow in the front yard, but Dexter Green's father owned the second best grocery-store in Black Bear—the best one was“The Hub,” patronized by the wealthy people from Sherry Island—and Dexter caddied only for pocket-money.

In the fall when the days became crisp and gray, and the long Minnesota winter shut down like the white lid of a box, Dexter's skis moved over the snow that hid the fairways of the golf course. At these times the country gave him a feeling of profound melancholy—it offended him that the links should lie in enforced fallowness, haunted by ragged sparrows for the long season. It was dreary, too, that on the tees where the gay colors fluttered in summer there were now only the desolate sand-boxes knee-deep in crusted ice. When he crossed the hills the wind blew cold as misery, and if the sun was out he tramped with his eyes squinted up against the hard dimensionless glare.

In April the winter ceased abruptly. The snow ran down into Black Bear Lake scarcely tarrying for the early golfers to brave the season with red and black balls. Without elation, without an interval of moist glory, the cold was gone.

Dexter knew that there was something dismal about this Northern spring, just as he knew there was something gorgeous about the fall. Fall made him clinch his hands and tremble and repeat idiotic sentences to himself, and make brisk abrupt gestures of command to imaginary audiences and armies. October filled him with hope which November raised to a sort of ecstatic triumph, and in this mood the fleeting brilliant impressions of the summer at Sherry Island were ready grist to his mill. He became a golf champion and defeated Mr. T. A. Hedrick in a marvelous match played a hundred times over the fairways of his imagination, a match each detail of which he changed about untiringly—sometimes he won with almost laughable ease, sometimes he came up magnificently from behind. Again, stepping from a Pierce-Arrow automobile, like Mr. Mortimer Jones, he strolled frigidly into the lounge of the Sherry Island Golf Club—or perhaps, surrounded by an admiring crowd, he gave an exhibition of fancy diving from the spring-board of the club raft.…Among those who watched him in open-mouthed wonder was Mr. Mortimer Jones.

And one day it came to pass that Mr. Jones—himself and not his ghost—came up to Dexter with tears in his eyes and said that Dexter was the—best caddy in the club, and wouldn't he decide not to quit if Mr. Jones made it worth his while, because every other—caddy in the club lost one ball a hole for him—regularly—

“No, sir,” said Dexter decisively, “I don't want to caddy any more.” Then, after a pause: “I'm too old.”

“You're not more than fourteen. Why the devil did you decide just this morning that you wanted to quit? You promised that next week you'd go over to the State tournament with me.”

“I decided I was too old.”

Dexter handed in his“A Class”badge, collected what money was due him from the caddy master, and walked home to Black Bear Village.

“The best—caddy I ever saw,” shouted Mr. Mortimer Jones over a drink that afternoon. “Never lost a ball! Willing! Intelligent! Quiet! Honest! Grateful!”

The little girl who had done this was eleven—beautifully ugly as little girls are apt to be who are destined after a few years to be inexpressibly lovely and bring no end of misery to a great number of men. The spark, however, was perceptible. There was a general ungodliness in the way her lips twisted down at the corners when she smiled, and in the—Heaven help us!—in the almost passionate quality of her eyes. Vitality is born early in such women. It was utterly in evidence now, shining through her thin frame in a sort of glow.

She had come eagerly out on to the course at nine o'clock with a white linen nurse and five small new golf-clubs in a white canvas bag which the nurse was carrying. When Dexter first saw her she was standing by the caddy house, rather ill at ease and trying to conceal the fact by engaging her nurse in an obviously unnatural conversation graced by startling and irrelevant grimaces from herself.

“Well, it's certainly a nice day, Hilda,” Dexter heard her say. She drew down the corners of her mouth, smiled, and glanced furtively around, her eyes in transit falling for an instant on Dexter.

Then to the nurse:

“Well, I guess there aren't very many people out here this morning, are there?”

The smile again—radiant, blatantly artificial—convincing.

“I don't know what we're supposed to do now,” said the nurse, looking nowhere in particular.

“Oh, that's all right. I'll fix it up.”

Dexter stood perfectly still, his mouth slightly ajar. He knew that if he moved forward a step his stare would be in her line of vision—if he moved backward he would lose his full view of her face. For a moment he had not realized how young she was. Now he remembered having seen her several times the year before—in bloomers.

Suddenly, involuntarily, he laughed, a short abrupt laugh—then, startled by himself, he turned and began to walk quickly away.

“Boy!”

Dexter stopped.

“Boy—”

Beyond question he was addressed. Not only that, but he was treated to that absurd smile, that preposterous smile—the memory of which at least a dozen men were to carry into middle age.

“Boy, do you know where the golf teacher is?”

“He's giving a lesson.”

“Well, do you know where the caddy-master is?”

“He isn't here yet this morning.”

“Oh.” For a moment this baffled her. She stood alternately on her right and left foot.

“We'd like to get a caddy,” said the nurse. “Mrs. Mortimer Jones sent us out to play golf, and we don't know how without we get a caddy.”

Here she was stopped by an ominous glance from Miss Jones, followed immediately by the smile.

“There aren't any caddies here except me,” said Dexter to the nurse, “and I got to stay here in charge until the caddy-master gets here.”

“Oh.”

Miss Jones and her retinue now withdrew, and at a proper distance from Dexter became involved in a heated conversation, which was concluded by Miss Jones taking one of the clubs and hitting it on the ground with violence. For further emphasis she raised it again and was about to bring it down smartly upon the nurse's bosom, when the nurse seized the club and twisted it from her hands.

“You damn little mean old thing!” cried Miss Jones wildly.

Another argument ensued. Realizing that the elements of the comedy were implied in the scene, Dexter several times began to laugh, but each time restrained the laugh before it reached audibility. He could not resist the monstrous conviction that the little girl was justified in beating the nurse.

The situation was resolved by the fortuitous appearance of the caddy-master, who was appealed to immediately by the nurse.

“Miss Jones is to have a little caddy, and this one says he can't go.”

“Mr. McKenna said I was to wait here till you came,” said Dexter quickly.

“Well, he's here now.” Miss Jones smiled cheerfully at the caddy-master. Then she dropped her bag and set off at a haughty mince toward the first tee.

“Well?” The caddy-master turned to Dexter. “What you standing there like a dummy for? Go pick up the young lady's clubs.”

“I don't think I'll go out to-day,” said Dexter.

“You don't—”

“I think I'll quit.”

The enormity of his decision frightened him. He was a favorite caddy, and the thirty dollars a month he earned through the summer were not to be made elsewhere around the lake. But he had received a strong emotional shock, and his perturbation required a violent and immediate outlet.

It is not so simple as that, either. As so frequently would be the case in the future, Dexter was unconsciously dictated to by his winter dreams.





II


Now, of course, the quality and the seasonability of these winter dreams varied, but the stuff of them remained. They persuaded Dexter several years later to pass up a business course at the State university—his father, prospering now, would have paid his way—for the precarious advantage of attending an older and more famous university in the East, where he was bothered by his scanty funds. But do not get the impression, because his winter dreams happened to be concerned at first with musings on the rich, that there was anything merely snobbish in the boy. He wanted not association with glittering things and glittering people—he wanted the glittering things themselves. Often he reached out for the best without knowing why he wanted it—and sometimes he ran up against the mysterious denials and prohibitions in which life indulges. It is with one of those denials and not with his career as a whole that this story deals.

He made money. It was rather amazing. After college he went to the city from which Black Bear Lake draws its wealthy patrons. When he was only twenty-three and had been there not quite two years, there were already people who liked to say: “Now there's a boy—”All about him rich men's sons were peddling bonds precariously, or investing patrimonies precariously, or plodding through the two dozen volumes of the“George Washington Commercial Course,” but Dexter borrowed a thousand dollars on his college degree and his confident mouth, and bought a partnership in a laundry.

It was a small laundry when he went into it but Dexter made a specialty of learning how the English washed fine woollen golf-stockings without shrinking them, and within a year he was catering to the trade that wore knickerbockers. Men were insisting that their Shetland hose and sweaters go to his laundry, just as they had insisted on a caddy who could find golf-balls. A little later he was doing their wives' lingerie as well—and running five branches in different parts of the city. Before he was twenty-seven he owned the largest string of laundries in his section of the country. It was then that he sold out and went to New York. But the part of his story that concerns us goes back to the days when he was making his first big success.

When he was twenty-three Mr. Hart—one of the gray-haired men who liked to say“Now there's a boy”—gave him a guest card to the Sherry Island Golf Club for a week-end. So he signed his name one day on the register, and that afternoon played golf in a foursome with Mr. Hart and Mr. Sandwood and Mr. T. A. Hedrick. He did not consider it necessary to remark that he had once carried Mr. Hart's bag over this same links, and that he knew every trap and gully with his eyes shut—but he found himself glancing at the four caddies who trailed them, trying to catch a gleam or gesture that would remind him of himself, that would lessen the gap which lay between his present and his past.

It was a curious day, slashed abruptly with fleeting, familiar impressions. One minute he had the sense of being a trespasser—in the next he was impressed by the tremendous superiority he felt toward Mr. T. A. Hedrick, who was a bore and not even a good golfer any more.

Then, because of a ball Mr. Hart lost near the fifteenth green, an enormous thing happened. While they were searching the stiff grasses of the rough there was a clear call of“Fore!” from behind a hill in their rear. And as they all turned abruptly from their search a bright new ball sliced abruptly over the hill and caught Mr. T. A. Hedrick in the abdomen.

“By Gad!” cried Mr. T. A. Hedrick, “they ought to put some of these crazy women off the course. It's getting to be outrageous.”

A head and a voice came up together over the hill:

“Do you mind if we go through?”

“You hit me in the stomach!” declared Mr. Hedrick wildly.

“Did I?” The girl approached the group of men. “I'm sorry. I yelled ‘Fore!’”

Her glance fell casually on each of the men—then scanned the fairway for her ball.

“Did I bounce into the rough?”

It was impossible to determine whether this question was ingenuous or malicious. In a moment, however, she left no doubt, for as her partner came up over the hill she called cheerfully:

“Here I am! I'd have gone on the green except that I hit something.”

As she took her stance for a short mashie shot, Dexter looked at her closely. She wore a blue gingham dress, rimmed at throat and shoulders with a white edging that accentuated her tan. The quality of exaggeration, of thinness, which had made her passionate eyes and down-turning mouth absurd at eleven, was gone now. She was arrestingly beautiful. The color in her cheeks was centered like the color in a picture—it was not a“high”color, but a sort of fluctuating and feverish warmth, so shaded that it seemed at any moment it would recede and disappear. This color and the mobility of her mouth gave a continual impression of flux, of intense life, of passionate vitality—balanced only partially by the sad luxury of her eyes.

She swung her mashie impatiently and without interest, pitching the ball into a sand-pit on the other side of the green. With a quick, insincere smile and a careless“Thank you!” she went on after it.

“That Judy Jones!” remarked Mr. Hedrick on the next tee, as they waited—some moments—for her to play on ahead. “All she needs is to be turned up and spanked for six months and then to be married off to an old-fashioned cavalry captain.”

“My God, she's good-looking!” said Mr. Sandwood, who was just over thirty.

“Good-looking!” cried Mr. Hedrick contemptuously. “She always looks as if she wanted to be kissed! Turning those big cow-eyes on every calf in town!”

It was doubtful if Mr. Hedrick intended a reference to the maternal instinct.

“She'd play pretty good golf if she'd try,” said Mr. Sandwood.

“She has no form,” said Mr. Hedrick solemnly.

“She has a nice figure,” said Mr. Sandwood.

“Better thank the Lord she doesn't drive a swifter ball,” said Mr. Hart, winking at Dexter.

Later in the afternoon the sun went down with a riotous swirl of gold and varying blues and scarlets, and left the dry, rustling night of Western summer. Dexter watched from the veranda of the Golf Club, watched the even overlap of the waters in the little wind, silver molasses under the harvest-moon. Then the moon held a finger to her lips and the lake became a clear pool, pale and quiet. Dexter put on his bathing-suit and swam out to the farthest raft, where he stretched dripping on the wet canvas of the spring-board.

There was a fish jumping and a star shining and the lights around the lake were gleaming. Over on a dark peninsula a piano was playing the songs of last summer and of summers before that—songs from“Chin-Chin”and“The Count of Luxemburg”and“The Chocolate Soldier”—and because the sound of a piano over a stretch of water had always seemed beautiful to Dexter he lay perfectly quiet and listened.

The tune the piano was playing at that moment had been gay and new five years before when Dexter was a sophomore at college. They had played it at a prom once when he could not afford the luxury of proms, and he had stood outside the gymnasium and listened. The sound of the tune precipitated in him a sort of ecstasy and it was with that ecstasy he viewed what happened to him now. It was a mood of intense appreciation, a sense that, for once, he was magnificently attuned to life and that everything about him was radiating a brightness and a glamour he might never know again.

A low, pale oblong detached itself suddenly from the darkness of the Island, spitting forth the reverberated sound of a racing motor-boat. Two white streamers of cleft water rolled themselves out behind it and almost immediately the boat was beside him, drowning out the hot tinkle of the piano in the drone of its spray. Dexter raising himself on his arms was aware of a figure standing at the wheel, of two dark eyes regarding him over the lengthening space of water—then the boat had gone by and was sweeping in an immense and purposeless circle of spray round and round in the middle of the lake. With equal eccentricity one of the circles flattened out and headed back toward the raft.

“Who's that?” she called, shutting off her motor. She was so near now that Dexter could see her bathing-suit, which consisted apparently of pink rompers.

The nose of the boat bumped the raft, and as the latter tilted rakishly he was precipitated toward her. With different degrees of interest they recognized each other.

“Aren't you one of those men we played through this afternoon?” she demanded.

He was.

“Well, do you know how to drive a motor-boat? Because if you do I wish you'd drive this one so I can ride on the surf-board behind. My name is Judy Jones”—she favored him with an absurd smirk—rather, what tried to be a smirk, for, twist her mouth as she might, it was not grotesque, it was merely beautiful—“and I live in a house over there on the Island, and in that house there is a man waiting for me. When he drove up at the door I drove out of the dock because he says I'm his ideal.”

There was a fish jumping and a star shining and the lights around the lake were gleaming. Dexter sat beside Judy Jones and she explained how her boat was driven. Then she was in the water, swimming to the floating surfboard with a sinuous crawl. Watching her was without effort to the eye, watching a branch waving or a sea-gull flying. Her arms, burned to butternut, moved sinuously among the dull platinum ripples, elbow appearing first, casting the forearm back with a cadence of falling water, then reaching out and down, stabbing a path ahead.

They moved out into the lake; turning, Dexter saw that she was kneeling on the low rear of the now uptilted surf-board.

“Go faster,” she called, “fast as it'll go.”

Obediently he jammed the lever forward and the white spray mounted at the bow. When he looked around again the girl was standing up on the rushing board, her arms spread wide, her eyes lifted toward the moon.

“It's awful cold,” she shouted. “What's your name?”

He told her.

“Well, why don't you come to dinner to-morrow night?”

His heart turned over like the fly-wheel of the boat, and, for the second time, her casual whim gave a new direction to his life.





III


Next evening while he waited for her to come down-stairs, Dexter peopled the soft deep summer room and the sun-porch that opened from it with the men who had already loved Judy Jones. He knew the sort of men they were—the men who when he first went to college had entered from the great prep schools with graceful clothes and the deep tan of healthy summers. He had seen that, in one sense, he was better than these men. He was newer and stronger. Yet in acknowledging to himself that he wished his children to be like them he was admitting that he was but the rough, strong stuff from which they eternally sprang.

When the time had come for him to wear good clothes, he had known who were the best tailors in America, and the best tailors in America had made him the suit he wore this evening. He had acquired that particular reserve peculiar to his university, that set it off from other universities. He recognized the value to him of such a mannerism and he had adopted it; he knew that to be careless in dress and manner required more confidence than to be careful. But carelessness was for his children. His mother's name had been Krimslich. She was a Bohemian of the peasant class and she had talked broken English to the end of her days. Her son must keep to the set patterns.

At a little after seven Judy Jones came down-stairs. She wore a blue silk afternoon dress, and he was disappointed at first that she had not put on something more elaborate. This feeling was accentuated when, after a brief greeting, she went to the door of a butler's pantry and pushing it open called: “You can serve dinner, Martha.” He had rather expected that a butler would announce dinner, that there would be a cocktail. Then he put these thoughts behind him as they sat down side by side on a lounge and looked at each other.

“Father and mother won't be here,” she said thoughtfully.

He remembered the last time he had seen her father, and he was glad the parents were not to be here to-night—they might wonder who he was. He had been born in Keeble, a Minnesota village fifty miles farther north, and he always gave Keeble as his home instead of Black Bear Village. Country towns were well enough to come from if they weren't inconveniently in sight and used as footstools by fashionable lakes.

They talked of his university, which she had visited frequently during the past two years, and of the near-by city which supplied Sherry Island with its patrons, and whither Dexter would return next day to his prospering laundries.

During dinner she slipped into a moody depression which gave Dexter a feeling of uneasiness. Whatever petulance she uttered in her throaty voice worried him. Whatever she smiled at—at him, at a chicken liver, at nothing—it disturbed him that her smile could have no root in mirth, or even in amusement. When the scarlet corners of her lips curved down, it was less a smile than an invitation to a kiss.

Then, after dinner, she led him out on the dark sun-porch and deliberately changed the atmosphere.

“Do you mind if I weep a little?” she said.

“I'm afraid I'm boring you,” he responded quickly.

“You're not. I like you. But I've just had a terrible afternoon. There was a man I cared about, and this afternoon he told me out of a clear sky that he was poor as a church-mouse. He'd never even hinted it before. Does this sound horribly mundane?”

“Perhaps he was afraid to tell you.”

“Suppose he was,” she answered. “He didn't start right. You see, if I'd thought of him as poor—well, I've been mad about loads of poor men, and fully intended to marry them all. But in this case, I hadn't thought of him that way, and my interest in him wasn't strong enough to survive the shock. As if a girl calmly informed her fiancé that she was a widow. He might not object to widows, but—”

“Let's start right,” she interrupted herself suddenly. “Who are you, anyhow?”

For a moment Dexter hesitated. Then:

“I'm nobody,” he announced. “My career is largely a matter of futures.”

“Are you poor?”

“No,” he said frankly, “I'm probably making more money than any man my age in the Northwest. I know that's an obnoxious remark, but you advised me to start right.”

There was a pause. Then she smiled and the corners of her mouth drooped and an almost imperceptible sway brought her closer to him, looking up into his eyes. A lump rose in Dexter's throat, and he waited breathless for the experiment, facing the unpredictable compound that would form mysteriously from the elements of their lips. Then he saw—she communicated her excitement to him, lavishly, deeply, with kisses that were not a promise but a fulfillment. They aroused in him not hunger demanding renewal but surfeit that would demand more surfeit…kisses that were like charity, creating want by holding back nothing at all.

It did not take him many hours to decide that he had wanted Judy Jones ever since he was a proud, desirous little boy.





IV


It began like that—and continued, with varying shades of intensity, on such a note right up to the dénouement. Dexter surrendered a part of himself to the most direct and unprincipled personality with which he had ever come in contact. Whatever Judy wanted, she went after with the full pressure of her charm. There was no divergence of method, no jockeying for position or premeditation of effects—there was a very little mental side to any of her affairs. She simply made men conscious to the highest degree of her physical loveliness. Dexter had no desire to change her. Her deficiencies were knit up with a passionate energy that transcended and justified them.

When, as Judy's head lay against his shoulder that first night, she whispered, “I don't know what's the matter with me. Last night I thought I was in love with a man and to-night I think I'm in love with you—”—it seemed to him a beautiful and romantic thing to say. It was the exquisite excitability that for the moment he controlled and owned. But a week later he was compelled to view this same quality in a different light. She took him in her roadster to a picnic supper, and after supper she disappeared, likewise in her roadster, with another man. Dexter became enormously upset and was scarcely able to be decently civil to the other people present. When she assured him that she had not kissed the other man, he knew she was lying—yet he was glad that she had taken the trouble to lie to him.

He was, as he found before the summer ended, one of a varying dozen who circulated about her. Each of them had at one time been favored above all others—about half of them still basked in the solace of occasional sentimental revivals. Whenever one showed signs of dropping out through long neglect, she granted him a brief honeyed hour, which encouraged him to tag along for a year or so longer. Judy made these forays upon the helpless and defeated without malice, indeed half unconscious that there was anything mischievous in what she did.

When a new man came to town every one dropped out—dates were automatically cancelled.

The helpless part of trying to do anything about it was that she did it all herself. She was not a girl who could be“won”in the kinetic sense—she was proof against cleverness, she was proof against charm; if any of these assailed her too strongly she would immediately resolve the affair to a physical basis, and under the magic of her physical splendor the strong as well as the brilliant played her game and not their own. She was entertained only by the gratification of her desires and by the direct exercise of her own charm. Perhaps from so much youthful love, so many youthful lovers, she had come, in self-defense, to nourish herself wholly from within.

Succeeding Dexter's first exhilaration came restlessness and dissatisfaction. The helpless ecstasy of losing himself in her was opiate rather than tonic. It was fortunate for his work during the winter that those moments of ecstasy came infrequently. Early in their acquaintance it had seemed for a while that there was a deep and spontaneous mutual attraction—that first August, for example—three days of long evenings on her dusky veranda, of strange wan kisses through the late afternoon, in shadowy alcoves or behind the protecting trellises of the garden arbors, of mornings when she was fresh as a dream and almost shy at meeting him in the clarity of the rising day. There was all the ecstasy of an engagement about it, sharpened by his realization that there was no engagement. It was during those three days that, for the first time, he had asked her to marry him. She said“maybe some day,” she said“kiss me,” she said“I'd like to marry you,” she said“I love you”—she said—nothing.

The three days were interrupted by the arrival of a New York man who visited at her house for half September. To Dexter's agony, rumor engaged them. The man was the son of the president of a great trust company. But at the end of a month it was reported that Judy was yawning. At a dance one night she sat all evening in a motor-boat with a local beau, while the New Yorker searched the club for her frantically. She told the local beau that she was bored with her visitor, and two days later he left. She was seen with him at the station, and it was reported that he looked very mournful indeed.

On this note the summer ended. Dexter was twenty-four, and he found himself increasingly in a position to do as he wished. He joined two clubs in the city and lived at one of them. Though he was by no means an integral part of the stag-lines at these clubs, he managed to be on hand at dances where Judy Jones was likely to appear. He could have gone out socially as much as he liked—he was an eligible young man, now, and popular with down-town fathers. His confessed devotion to Judy Jones had rather solidified his position. But he had no social aspirations and rather despised the dancing men who were always on tap for the Thursday or Saturday parties and who filled in at dinners with the younger married set. Already he was playing with the idea of going East to New York. He wanted to take Judy Jones with him. No disillusion as to the world in which she had grown up could cure his illusion as to her desirability.

Remember that—for only in the light of it can what he did for her be understood.

Eighteen months after he first met Judy Jones he became engaged to another girl. Her name was Irene Scheerer, and her father was one of the men who had always believed in Dexter. Irene was light-haired and sweet and honorable, and a little stout, and she had two suitors whom she pleasantly relinquished when Dexter formally asked her to marry him.

Summer, fall, winter, spring, another summer, another fall—so much he had given of his active life to the incorrigible lips of Judy Jones. She had treated him with interest, with encouragement, with malice, with indifference, with contempt. She had inflicted on him the innumerable little slights and indignities possible in such a case—as if in revenge for having ever cared for him at all. She had beckoned him and yawned at him and beckoned him again and he had responded often with bitterness and narrowed eyes. She had brought him ecstatic happiness and intolerable agony of spirit. She had caused him untold inconvenience and not a little trouble. She had insulted him, and she had ridden over him, and she had played his interest in her against his interest in his work—for fun. She had done everything to him except to criticise him—this she had not done—it seemed to him only because it might have sullied the utter indifference she manifested and sincerely felt toward him.

When autumn had come and gone again it occurred to him that he could not have Judy Jones. He had to beat this into his mind but he convinced himself at last. He lay awake at night for a while and argued it over. He told himself the trouble and the pain she had caused him, he enumerated her glaring deficiencies as a wife. Then he said to himself that he loved her, and after a while he fell asleep. For a week, lest he imagined her husky voice over the telephone or her eyes opposite him at lunch, he worked hard and late, and at night he went to his office and plotted out his years.

At the end of a week he went to a dance and cut in on her once. For almost the first time since they had met he did not ask her to sit out with him or tell her that she was lovely. It hurt him that she did not miss these things—that was all. He was not jealous when he saw that there was a new man to-night. He had been hardened against jealousy long before.

He stayed late at the dance. He sat for an hour with Irene Scheerer and talked about books and about music. He knew very little about either. But he was beginning to be master of his own time now, and he had a rather priggish notion that he—the young and already fabulously successful Dexter Green—should know more about such things.

That was in October, when he was twenty-five. In January, Dexter and Irene became engaged. It was to be announced in June, and they were to be married three months later.

The Minnesota winter prolonged itself interminably, and it was almost May when the winds came soft and the snow ran down into Black Bear Lake at last. For the first time in over a year Dexter was enjoying a certain tranquility of spirit. Judy Jones had been in Florida, and afterward in Hot Springs, and somewhere she had been engaged, and somewhere she had broken it off. At first, when Dexter had definitely given her up, it had made him sad that people still linked them together and asked for news of her, but when he began to be placed at dinner next to Irene Scheerer people didn't ask him about her any more—they told him about her. He ceased to be an authority on her.

May at last. Dexter walked the streets at night when the darkness was damp as rain, wondering that so soon, with so little done, so much of ecstasy had gone from him. May one year back had been marked by Judy's poignant, unforgivable, yet forgiven turbulence—it had been one of those rare times when he fancied she had grown to care for him. That old penny's worth of happiness he had spent for this bushel of content. He knew that Irene would be no more than a curtain spread behind him, a hand moving among gleaming tea-cups, a voice calling to children… fire and loveliness were gone, the magic of nights and the wonder of the varying hours and seasons…slender lips, down-turning, dropping to his lips and bearing him up into a heaven of eyes.…The thing was deep in him. He was too strong and alive for it to die lightly.

In the middle of May when the weather balanced for a few days on the thin bridge that led to deep summer he turned in one night at Irene's house. Their engagement was to be announced in a week now—no one would be surprised at it. And to-night they would sit together on the lounge at the University Club and look on for an hour at the dancers. It gave him a sense of solidity to go with her—she was so sturdily popular, so intensely“great.”

He mounted the steps of the brownstone house and stepped inside.

“Irene,” he called.

Mrs. Scheerer came out of the living-room to meet him.

“Dexter,” she said, “Irene's gone up-stairs with a splitting headache. She wanted to go with you but I made her go to bed.”

“Nothing serious, I—”

“Oh, no. She's going to play golf with you in the morning. You can spare her for just one night, can't you, Dexter?”

Her smile was kind. She and Dexter liked each other. In the living-room he talked for a moment before he said good-night.

Returning to the University Club, where he had rooms, he stood in the doorway for a moment and watched the dancers. He leaned against the door-post, nodded at a man or two—yawned.

“Hello, darling.”

The familiar voice at his elbow startled him. Judy Jones had left a man and crossed the room to him—Judy Jones, a slender enamelled doll in cloth of gold: gold in a band at her head, gold in two slipper points at her dress's hem. The fragile glow of her face seemed to blossom as she smiled at him. A breeze of warmth and light blew through the room. His hands in the pockets of his dinner-jacket tightened spasmodically. He was filled with a sudden excitement.

“When did you get back?” he asked casually.

“Come here and I'll tell you about it.”

She turned and he followed her. She had been away—he could have wept at the wonder of her return. She had passed through enchanted streets, doing things that were like provocative music. All mysterious happenings, all fresh and quickening hopes, had gone away with her, come back with her now.

She turned in the doorway.

“Have you a car here? If you haven't, I have.”

“I have a coupé.”

In then, with a rustle of golden cloth. He slammed the door. Into so many cars she had stepped—like this—like that—her back against the leather, so—her elbow resting on the door—waiting. She would have been soiled long since had there been anything to soil her—except herself—but this was her own self outpouring.

With an effort he forced himself to start the car and back into the street. This was nothing, he must remember. She had done this before, and he had put her behind him, as he would have crossed a bad account from his books.

He drove slowly down-town and, affecting abstraction, traversed the deserted streets of the business section, peopled here and there where a movie was giving out its crowd or where consumptive or pugilistic youth lounged in front of pool halls. The clink of glasses and the slap of hands on the bars issued from saloons, cloisters of glazed glass and dirty yellow light.

She was watching him closely and the silence was embarrassing, yet in this crisis he could find no casual word with which to profane the hour. At a convenient turning he began to zigzag back toward the University Club.

“Have you missed me?” she asked suddenly.

“Everybody missed you.”

He wondered if she knew of Irene Scheerer. She had been back only a day—her absence had been almost contemporaneous with his engagement.

“What a remark!” Judy laughed sadly—without sadness. She looked at him searchingly. He became absorbed in the dashboard.

“You're handsomer than you used to be,” she said thoughtfully. “Dexter, you have the most rememberable eyes.”

He could have laughed at this, but he did not laugh. It was the sort of thing that was said to sophomores. Yet it stabbed at him.

“I'm awfully tired of everything, darling.” She called every one darling, endowing the endearment with careless, individual comraderie. “I wish you'd marry me.”

The directness of this confused him. He should have told her now that he was going to marry another girl, but he could not tell her. He could as easily have sworn that he had never loved her.

“I think we'd get along,” she continued, on the same note, “unless probably you've forgotten me and fallen in love with another girl.”

Her confidence was obviously enormous. She had said, in effect, that she found such a thing impossible to believe, that if it were true he had merely committed a childish indiscretion—and probably to show off. She would forgive him, because it was not a matter of any moment but rather something to be brushed aside lightly.

“Of course you could never love anybody but me,” she continued. “I like the way you love me. Oh, Dexter, have you forgotten last year?”

“No, I haven't forgotten.”

“Neither have I!”

Was she sincerely moved—or was she carried along by the wave of her own acting?

“I wish we could be like that again,” she said, and he forced himself to answer:

“I don't think we can.”

“I suppose not.…I hear you're giving Irene Scheerer a violent rush.”

There was not the faintest emphasis on the name, yet Dexter was suddenly ashamed.

“Oh, take me home,” cried Judy suddenly; “I don't want to go back to that idiotic dance—with those children.”

Then, as he turned up the street that led to the residence district, Judy began to cry quietly to herself. He had never seen her cry before.

The dark street lightened, the dwellings of the rich loomed up around them, he stopped his coupé in front of the great white bulk of the Mortimer Joneses house, somnolent, gorgeous, drenched with the splendor of the damp moonlight. Its solidity startled him. The strong walls, the steel of the girders, the breadth and beam and pomp of it were there only to bring out the contrast with the young beauty beside him. It was sturdy to accentuate her slightness—as if to show what a breeze could be generated by a butter fly's wing.

He sat perfectly quiet, his nerves in wild clamor, afraid that if he moved he would find her irresistibly in his arms. Two tears had rolled down her wet face and trembled on her upper lip.

“I'm more beautiful than anybody else,” she said brokenly, “why can't I be happy?” Her moist eyes tore at his stability—her mouth turned slowly downward with an exquisite sadness: “I'd like to marry you if you'll have me, Dexter. I suppose you think I'm not worth having, but I'll be so beautiful for you, Dexter.”

A million phrases of anger, pride, passion, hatred, tenderness fought on his lips. Then a perfect wave of emotion washed over him, carrying off with it a sediment of wisdom, of convention, of doubt, of honor. This was his girl who was speaking, his own, his beautiful, his pride.

“Won't you come in?” He heard her draw in her breath sharply.

Waiting.

“All right,” his voice was trembling, “I'll come in.”





V


It was strange that neither when it was over nor a long time afterward did he regret that night. Looking at it from the perspective of ten years, the fact that Judy's flare for him endured just one month seemed of little importance. Nor did it matter that by his yielding he subjected himself to a deeper agony in the end and gave serious hurt to Irene Scheerer and to Irene's parents, who had befriended him. There was nothing sufficiently pictorial about Irene's grief to stamp itself on his mind.

Dexter was at bottom hard-minded. The attitude of the city on his action was of no importance to him, not because he was going to leave the city, but because any outside attitude on the situation seemed superficial. He was completely indifferent to popular opinion. Nor, when he had seen that it was no use, that he did not possess in himself the power to move fundamentally or to hold Judy Jones, did he bear any malice toward her. He loved her, and he would love her until the day he was too old for loving—but he could not have her. So he tasted the deep pain that is reserved only for the strong, just as he had tasted for a little while the deep happiness.

Even the ultimate falsity of the grounds upon which Judy terminated the engagement that she did not want to“take him away”from Irene—Judy, who had wanted nothing else—did not revolt him. He was beyond any revulsion or any amusement.

He went East in February with the intention of selling out his laundries and settling in New York—but the war came to America in March and changed his plans. He returned to the West, handed over the management of the business to his partner, and went into the first officers' training-camp in late April. He was one of those young thousands who greeted the war with a certain amount of relief, welcoming the liberation from webs of tangled emotion.





VI


This story is not his biography, remember, although things creep into it which have nothing to do with those dreams he had when he was young. We are almost done with them and with him now. There is only one more incident to be related here, and it happens seven years farther on.

It took place in New York, where he had done well—so well that there were no barriers too high for him. He was thirty-two years old, and, except for one flying trip immediately after the war, he had not been West in seven years. A man named Devlin from Detroit came into his office to see him in a business way, and then and there this incident occurred, and closed out, so to speak, this particular side of his life.

“So you're from the Middle West,” said the man Devlin with careless curiosity. “That's funny—I thought men like you were probably born and raised on Wall Street. You know—wife of one of my best friends in Detroit came from your city. I was an usher at the wedding.”

Dexter waited with no apprehension of what was coming.

“Judy Simms,” said Devlin with no particular interest; “Judy Jones she was once.”

“Yes, I knew her.” A dull impatience spread over him. He had heard, of course, that she was married—perhaps deliberately he had heard no more.

“Awfully nice girl,” brooded Devlin meaninglessly, “I'm sort of sorry for her.”

“Why?” Something in Dexter was alert, receptive, at once.

“Oh, Lud Simms has gone to pieces in a way. I don't mean he ill-uses her, but he drinks and runs around—”

“Doesn't she run around?”

“No. Stays at home with her kids.”

“Oh.”

“She's a little too old for him,” said Devlin.

“Too old!” cried Dexter. “Why, man, she's only twenty-seven.”

He was possessed with a wild notion of rushing out into the streets and taking a train to Detroit. He rose to his feet spasmodically.

“I guess you're busy,” Devlin apologized quickly. “I didn't realize—”

“No, I'm not busy,” said Dexter, steadying his voice. “I'm not busy at all. Not busy at all. Did you say she was—twenty-seven? No, I said she was twenty-seven.”

“Yes, you did,” agreed Devlin dryly.

“Go on, then. Go on.”

“What do you mean?”

“About Judy Jones.”

Devlin looked at him helplessly.

“Well, that's—I told you all there is to it. He treats her like the devil. Oh, they're not going to get divorced or anything. When he's particularly outrageous she forgives him. In fact, I'm inclined to think she loves him. She was a pretty girl when she first came to Detroit.”

A pretty girl! The phrase struck Dexter as ludicrous.

“Isn't she—a pretty girl, any more?”

“Oh, she's all right.”

“Look here,” said Dexter, sitting down suddenly, “I don't understand. You say she was a ‘pretty girl' and now you say she's ‘all right.’ I don't understand what you mean—Judy Jones wasn't a pretty girl, at all. She was a great beauty. Why, I knew her, I knew her. She was—”

Devlin laughed pleasantly.

“I'm not trying to start a row,” he said. “I think Judy's a nice girl and I like her. I can't understand how a man like Lud Simms could fall madly in love with her, but he did.” Then he added: “Most of the women likeher.”

Dexter looked closely at Devlin, thinking wildly that there must be a reason for this, some insensitivity in the man or some private malice.

“Lots of women fade just like that,” Devlin snapped his fingers. “You must have seen it happen. Perhaps I've forgotten how pretty she was at her wedding. I've seen her so much since then, you see. She has nice eyes.”

A sort of dullness settled down upon Dexter. For the first time in his life he felt like getting very drunk. He knew that he was laughing loudly at something Devlin had said, but he did not know what it was or why it was funny. When, in a few minutes, Devlin went he lay down on his lounge and looked out the window at the New York sky-line into which the sun was sinking in dull lovely shades of pink and gold.

He had thought that having nothing else to lose he was invulnerable at last—but he knew that he had just lost something more, as surely as if he had married Judy Jones and seen her fade away before his eyes.

The dream was gone. Something had been taken from him. In a sort of panic he pushed the palms of his hands into his eyes and tried to bring up a picture of the waters lapping on Sherry Island and the moonlit veranda, and gingham on the golf-links and the dry sun and the gold color of her neck's soft down. And her mouth damp to his kisses and her eyes plaintive with melancholy and her freshness like new fine linen in the morning. Why, these things were no longer in the world! They had existed and they existed no longer.

For the first time in years the tears were streaming down his face. But they were for himself now. He did not care about mouth and eyes and moving hands. He wanted to care, and he could not care. For he had gone away and he could never go back any more. The gates were closed, the sun was gone down, and there was no beauty but the gray beauty of steel that withstands all time. Even the grief he could have borne was left behind in the country of illusion, of youth, of the richness of life, where his winter dreams had flourished.

“Long ago,” he said, “long ago, there was something in me, but now that thing is gone. Now that thing is gone, that thing is gone. I cannot cry. I cannot care. That thing will come back no more.”





“THE SENSIBLE THING”


I


At the Great American Lunch Hour young George O'Kelly straightened his desk deliberately and with an assumed air of interest. No one in the office must know that he was in a hurry, for success is a matter of atmosphere, and it is not well to advertise the fact that your mind is separated from your work by a distance of seven hundred miles.

But once out of the building he set his teeth and began to run, glancing now and then at the gay noon of early spring which filled Times Square and loitered less than twenty feet over the heads of the crowd. The crowd all looked slightly upward and took deep March breaths, and the sun dazzled their eyes so that scarcely any one saw any one else but only their own reflection on the sky.

George O'Kelly, whose mind was over seven hundred miles away, thought that all outdoors was horrible. He rushed into the subway, and for ninety-five blocks bent a frenzied glance on a car-card which showed vividly how he had only one chance in five of keeping his teeth for ten years. At 137th Street he broke off his study of commercial art, left the subway, and began to run again, a tireless, anxious run that brought him this time to his home—one room in a high, horrible apartment-house in the middle of nowhere.

There it was on the bureau, the letter—in sacred ink, on blessed paper—all over the city, people, if they listened, could hear the beating of George O'Kelly's heart. He read the commas, the blots, and the thumb-smudge on the margin—then he threw himself hopelessly upon his bed.

He was in a mess, one of those terrific messes which are ordinary incidents in the life of the poor, which follow poverty like birds of prey. The poor go under or go up or go wrong or even go on, somehow, in away the poor have—but George O'Kelly was so new to poverty that had any one denied the uniqueness of his case he would have been astounded.

Less than two years ago he had been graduated with honors from The Massachusetts Institute of Technology and had taken a position with a firm of construction engineers in southern Tennessee. All his life he had thought in terms of tunnels and skyscrapers and great squat dams and tall, three-towered bridges, that were like dancers holding hands in a row, with heads as tall as cities and skirts of cable strand. It had seemed romantic to George O'Kelly to change the sweep of rivers and the shape of mountains so that life could flourish in the old bad lands of the world where it had never taken root before. He loved steel, and there was always steel near him in his dreams, liquid steel, steel in bars, and blocks and beams and formless plastic masses, waiting for him, as paint and canvas to his hand. Steel inexhaustible, to be made lovely and austere in his imaginative fire…

At present he was an insurance clerk at forty dollars a week with his dream slipping fast behind him. The dark little girl who had made this mess, this terrible and intolerable mess, was waiting to be sent for in a town in Tennessee.

In fifteen minutes the woman from whom he sublet his room knocked and asked him with maddening kindness if, since he was home, he would have some lunch. He shook his head, but the interruption aroused him, and getting up from the bed he wrote a telegram.

“Letter depressed me have you lost your nerve you are foolish and just upset to think of breaking off why not marry me immediately sure we can make it all right—”

He hesitated for a wild minute, and then added in a hand that could scarcely be recognized as his own: “In any case I will arrive to-morrow at six o'clock.”

When he finished he ran out of the apartment and down to the telegraph office near the subway stop. He possessed in this world not quite one hundred dollars, but the letter showed that she was“nervous”and this left him no choice. He knew what“nervous”meant—that she was emotionally depressed, that the prospect of marrying into a life of poverty and struggle was putting too much strain upon her love.

George O'Kelly reached the insurance company at his usual run, the run that had become almost second nature to him, that seemed best to express the tension under which he lived. He went straight to the manager's office.

“I want to see you, Mr. Chambers,” he announced breathlessly.

“Well?” Two eyes, eyes like winter windows, glared at him with ruthless impersonality.

“I want to get four days' vacation.”

“Why, you had a vacation just two weeks ago!” said Mr. Chambers in surprise.

“That's true,” admitted the distraught young man, “but now I've got to have another.”

“Where'd you go last time? To your home?”

“No, I went to—a place in Tennessee.”

“Well, where do you want to go this time?”

“Well, this time I want to go to—a place in Tennessee.”

“You're consistent, anyhow,” said the manager dryly. “But I didn't realize you were employed here as a traveling salesman.”

“I'm not,” cried George desperately, “but I've got to go.”

“All right,” agreed Mr. Chambers, “but you don't have to come back. So don't!”

“I won't.” And to his own astonishment as well as Mr. Chambers' George's face grew pink with pleasure. He felt happy, exultant—for the first time in six months he was absolutely free. Tears of gratitude stood in his eyes, and he seized Mr. Chambers warmly by the hand.

“I want to thank you,” he said with a rush of emotion. “I don't want to come back. I think I'd have gone crazy if you'd said that I could come back. Only I couldn't quit myself, you see, and I want to thank you for—for quitting for me.”

He waved his hand magnanimously, shouted aloud, “You owe me three days' salary but you can keep it!” and rushed from the office. Mr. Chambers rang for his stenographer to ask if O'Kelly had seemed queer lately. He had fired many men in the course of his career, and they had taken it in many different ways, but none of them had thanked him—ever before.

Jonquil Cary was her name, and to George O'Kelly nothing had ever looked so fresh and pale as her face when she saw him and fled to him eagerly along the station platform. Her arms were raised to him, her mouth was half parted for his kiss, when she held him off suddenly and lightly and, with a touch of embarrassment, looked around. Two boys, somewhat younger than George, were standing in the background.

“This is Mr. Craddock and Mr. Holt,” she announced cheerfully. “You met them when you were here before.”

Disturbed by the transition of a kiss into an introduction and suspecting some hidden significance, George was more confused when he found that the automobile which was to carry them to Jonquil's house belonged to one of the two young men. It seemed to put him at a disadvantage. On the way Jonquil chattered between the front and back seats, and when he tried to slip his arm around her under cover of the twilight she compelled him with a quick movement to take her hand instead.

“Is this street on the way to your house?” he whispered. “I don't recognize it.”

“It's the new boulevard. Jerry just got this car to-day, and he wants to show it to me before he takes us home.”

When, after twenty minutes, they were deposited at Jonquil's house, George felt that the first happiness of the meeting, the joy he had recognized so surely in her eyes back in the station, had been dissipated by the intrusion of the ride. Something that he had looked forward to had been rather casually lost, and he was brooding on this as he said good night stiffly to the two young men. Then his ill-humor faded as Jonquil drew him into a familiar embrace under the dim light of the front hall and told him in a dozen ways, of which the best was without words, how she had missed him. Her emotion reassured him, promised his anxious heart that everything would be all right.

They sat together on the sofa, overcome by each other's presence, beyond all except fragmentary endearments. At the supper hour Jonquil's father and mother appeared and were glad to see George. They liked him, and had been interested in his engineering career when he had first come to Tennessee over a year before. They had been sorry when he had given it up and gone to New York to look for something more immediately profitable, but while they deplored the curtailment of his career they sympathized with him and were ready to recognize the engagement. During dinner they asked about his progress in New York.

“Everything's going fine,” he told them with enthusiasm. “I've been promoted—better salary.”

He was miserable as he said this—but they were all so glad.

“They must like you,” said Mrs. Cary, “that's certain—or they wouldn't let you off twice in three weeks to come down here.”

“I told them they had to,” explained George hastily; “I told them if they didn't I wouldn't work for them any more.”

“But you ought to save your money,” Mrs. Cary reproached him gently. “Not spend it all on this expensive trip.”

Dinner was over—he and Jonquil were alone and she came back into his arms.

“So glad you're here,” she sighed. “Wish you never were going away again, darling.”

“Do you miss me?”

“Oh, so much, so much.”

“Do you—do other men come to see you often? Like those two kids?”

The question surprised her. The dark velvet eyes stared at him.

“Why, of course they do. All the time. Why—I've told you in letters that they did, dearest.”

This was true—when he had first come to the city there had been already a dozen boys around her, responding to her picturesque fragility with adolescent worship, and a few of them perceiving that her beautiful eyes were also sane and kind.

“Do you expect me never to go anywhere”—Jonquil demanded, leaning back against the sofa-pillows until she seemed to look at him from many miles away—“and just fold my hands and sit still—forever?”

“What do you mean?” he blurted out in a panic. “Do you mean you think I'll never have enough money to marry you?”

“Oh, don't jump at conclusions so, George.”

“I'm not jumping at conclusions. That's what you said.”

George decided suddenly that he was on dangerous grounds. He had not intended to let anything spoil this night. He tried to take her again in his arms, but she resisted unexpectedly, saying:

“It's hot. I'm going to get the electric fan.”

When the fan was adjusted they sat down again, but he was in a super-sensitive mood and involuntarily he plunged into the specific world he had intended to avoid.

“When will you marry me?”

“Are you ready for me to marry you?”

All at once his nerves gave way, and he sprang to his feet.

“Let's shut off that damned fan,” he cried, “it drives me wild. It's like a clock ticking away all the time I'll be with you. I came here to be happy and forget everything about New York and time—”

He sank down on the sofa as suddenly as he had risen. Jonquil turned off the fan, and drawing his head down into her lap began stroking his hair.

“Let's sit like this,” she said softly, “just sit quiet like this, and I'll put you to sleep. You're all tired and nervous and your sweetheart'll take care of you.”

“But I don't want to sit like this,” he complained, jerking up suddenly, “I don't want to sit like this at all. I want you to kiss me. That's the only thing that makes me rest. And anyways I'm not nervous—it's you that's nervous. I'm not nervous at all.”

To prove that he wasn't nervous he left the couch and plumped himself into a rocking-chair across the room.

“Just when I'm ready to marry you you write me the most nervous letters, as if you're going to back out, and I have to come rushing down here—”

“You don't have to come if you don't want to.”

“But I do want to!” insisted George.

It seemed to him that he was being very cool and logical and that she was putting him deliberately in the wrong. With every word they were drawing farther and farther apart—and he was unable to stop himself or to keep worry and pain out of his voice.

But in a minute Jonquil began to cry sorrowfully and he came back to the sofa and put his arm around her. He was the comforter now, drawing her head close to his shoulder, murmuring old familiar things until she grew calmer and only trembled a little, spasmodically, in his arms. For over an hour they sat there, while the evening pianos thumped their last cadences into the street outside. George did not move, or think, or hope, lulled into numbness by the premonition of disaster. The clock would tick on, past eleven, past twelve, and then Mrs. Cary would call down gently over the banister—beyond that he saw only to-morrow and despair.





III


In the heat of the next day the breaking-point came. They had each guessed the truth about the other, but of the two she was the more ready to admit the situation.

“There's no use going on,” she said miserably, “you know you hate the insurance business, and you'll never do well in it.”

“That's not it,” he insisted stubbornly; “I hate going on alone. If you'll marry me and come with me and take a chance with me, I can make good at anything, but not while I'm worrying about you down here.”

She was silent a long time before she answered, not thinking—for she had seen the end—but only waiting, because she knew that every word would seem more cruel than the last. Finally she spoke:

“George, I love you with all my heart, and I don't see how I can ever love any one else but you. If you'd been ready for me two months ago I'd have married you—now I can't because it doesn't seem to be the sensible thing.”

He made wild accusations—there was some one else—she was keeping something from him!

“No, there's no one else.”

This was true. But reacting from the strain of this affair she had found relief in the company of young boys like Jerry Holt, who had the merit of meaning absolutely nothing in her life.

George didn't take the situation well, at all. He seized her in his arms and tried literally to kiss her into marrying him at once. When this failed, he broke into a long monologue of self-pity, and ceased only when he saw that he was making himself despicable in her sight. He threatened to leave when he had no intention of leaving, and refused to go when she told him that, after all, it was best that he should.

For a while she was sorry, then for another while she was merely kind.

“You'd better go now,” she cried at last, so loud that Mrs. Cary came down-stairs in alarm.

“Is something the matter?”

“I'm going away, Mrs. Cary,” said George brokenly. Jonquil had left the room.

“Don't feel so badly, George.” Mrs. Cary blinked at him in helpless sympathy—sorry and, in the same breath, glad that the little tragedy was almost done. “If I were you I'd go home to your mother for a week or so. Perhaps after all this is the sensible thing—”

“Please don't talk,” he cried. “Please don't say anything to me now!”

Jonquil came into the room again, her sorrow and her nervousness alike tucked under powder and rouge and hat.

“I've ordered a taxicab,” she said impersonally. “We can drive around until your train leaves.”

She walked out on the front porch. George put on his coat and hat and stood for a minute exhausted in the hall—he had eaten scarcely a bite since he had left New York. Mrs. Cary came over, drew his head down and kissed him on the cheek, and he felt very ridiculous and weak in his knowledge that the scene had been ridiculous and weak at the end. If he had only gone the night before—left her for the last time with a decent pride.

The taxi had come, and for an hour these two that had been loversrode along the less-frequented streets. He held her hand and grew calmer in the sunshine, seeing too late that there had been nothing all along to do or say.

“I'll come back,” he told her.

“I know you will,” she answered, trying to put a cheery faith into her voice. “And we'll write each other—sometimes.”

“No,” he said, “we won't write. I couldn't stand that. Some day I'll come back.”

“I'll never forget you, George.”

They reached the station, and she went with him while he bought his ticket.…

“Why, George O'Kelly and Jonquil Cary!”

It was a man and a girl whom George had known when he had worked in town, and Jonquil seemed to greet their presence with relief. For an interminable five minutes they all stood there talking; then the train roared into the station, and with ill-concealed agony in his face George held out his arms toward Jonquil. She took an uncertain step toward him, faltered, and then pressed his hand quickly as if she were taking leave of a chance friend.

“Good-by, George,” she was saying, “I hope you have a pleasant trip.

“Good-by, George. Come back and see us all again.”

Dumb, almost blind with pain, he seized his suitcase, and in some dazed way got himself aboard the train.

Past clanging street-crossings, gathering speed through wide suburban spaces toward the sunset. Perhaps she too would see the sunset and pause for a moment, turning, remembering, before he faded with her sleep into the past. This night's dusk would cover up forever the sun and the trees and the flowers and laughter of his young world.





IV


On a damp afternoon in September of the following year a young man with his face burned to a deep copper glow got off a train at a city in Tennessee. He looked around anxiously, and seemed relieved when he found that there was no one in the station to meet him. He taxied to the best hotel in the city where he registered with some satisfaction as George O'Kelly, Cuzco, Peru.

Up in his room he sat for a few minutes at the window looking down into the familiar street below. Then with his hand trembling faintly he took off the telephone receiver and called a number.

“Is Miss Jonquil in?”

“This is she.”

“Oh—”His voice after overcoming a faint tendency to waver went on with friendly formality.

“This is George O'Kelly. Did you get my letter?”

“Yes. I thought you'd be in to-day.”

Her voice, cool and unmoved, disturbed him, but not as he had expected. This was the voice of a stranger, unexcited, pleasantly glad to see him—that was all. He wanted to put down the telephone and catch his breath.

“I haven't seen you for—a long time.” He succeeded in making this sound offhand. “Over a year.”

He knew how long it had been—to the day.

“It'll be awfully nice to talk to you again.”

“I'll be there in about an hour.”

He hung up. For four long seasons every minute of his leisure had been crowded with anticipation of this hour, and now this hour was here. He had thought of finding her married, engaged, in love—he had not thought she would be unstirred at his return.

There would never again in his life, he felt, be another ten months like these he had just gone through. He had made an admittedly remarkable showing for a young engineer—stumbled into two unusual opportunities, one in Peru, whence he had just returned, and another, consequent upon it, in New York, whither he was bound. In this short time he had risen from poverty into a position of unlimited opportunity.

He looked at himself in the dressing-table mirror. He was almost black with tan, but it was a romantic black, and in the last week, since he had had time to think about it, it had given him considerable pleasure. The hardiness of his frame, too, he appraised with a sort of fascination. He had lost part of an eyebrow somewhere, and he still wore an elastic bandage on his knee, but he was too young not to realize that on the steamer many women had looked at him with unusual tributary interest.

His clothes, of course, were frightful. They had been made for him by a Greek tailor in Lima—in two days. He was young enough, too, to have explained this sartorial deficiency to Jonquil in his otherwise laconic note. The only further detail it contained was a request that he should not be met at the station.

George O'Kelly, of Cuzco, Peru, waited an hour and a half in the hotel, until, to be exact, the sun had reached a midway position in the sky. Then, freshly shaven and talcum-powdered toward a somewhat more Caucasian hue, for vanity at the last minute had overcome romance, he engaged a taxicab and set out for the house he knew so well.

He was breathing hard—he noticed this but he told himself that it was excitement, not emotion. He was here; she was not married—that was enough. He was not even sure what he had to say to her. But this was the moment of his life that he felt he could least easily have dispensed with. There was no triumph, after all, without a girl concerned, and if he did not lay his spoils at her feet he could at least hold them for a passing moment before her eyes.

The house loomed up suddenly beside him, and his first thought was that it had assumed a strange unreality. There was nothing changed—only everything was changed. It was smaller and it seemed shabbier than before—there was no cloud of magic hovering over its roof and issuing from the windows of the upper floor. He rang the door-bell and an unfamiliar colored maid appeared. Miss Jonquil would be down in a moment. He wet his lips nervously and walked into the sitting-room—and the feeling of unreality increased. After all, he saw, this was only a room, and not the enchanted chamber where he had passed those poignant hours. He sat in a chair, amazed to find it a chair, realizing that his imagination had distorted and colored all these simple familiar things.

Then the door opened and Jonquil came into the room—and it was as though everything in it suddenly blurred before his eyes. He had not remembered how beautiful she was, and he felt his face grow pale and his voice diminish to a poor sigh in his throat.

She was dressed in pale green, and a gold ribbon bound back her dark, straight hair like a crown. The familiar velvet eyes caught his as she came through the door, and a spasm of fright went through him at her beauty's power of inflicting pain.

He said“Hello,” and they each took a few steps forward and shook hands. Then they sat in chairs quite far apart and gazed at each other across the room.

“You've come back,” she said, and he answered just as tritely: “I wanted to stop in and see you as I came through.”

He tried to neutralize the tremor in his voice by looking anywhere but at her face. The obligation to speak was on him, but, unless he immediately began to boast, it seemed that there was nothing to say. There had never been anything casual in their previous relations—it didn't seem possible that people in this position would talk about the weather.

“This is ridiculous,” he broke out in sudden embarrassment. “I don't know exactly what to do. Does my being here bother you?”

“No.” The answer was both reticent and impersonally sad. It depressed him.

“Are you engaged?” he demanded.

“No.”

“Are you in love with some one?”

She shook her head.

“Oh.” He leaned back in his chair. Another subject seemed exhausted—the interview was not taking the course he had intended.

“Jonquil,” he began, this time on a softer key, “after all that's happened between us, I wanted to come back and see you. Whatever I do in the future I'll never love another girl as I've loved you.”

This was one of the speeches he had rehearsed. On the steamer it had seemed to have just the right note—a reference to the tenderness he would always feel for her combined with a non-committal attitude toward his present state of mind. Here with the past around him, beside him, growing minute by minute more heavy on the air, it seemed theatrical and stale.

She made no comment, sat without moving, her eyes fixed on him with an expression that might have meant everything or nothing.

“You don't love me any more, do you?” he asked her in a level voice.

“No.”

When Mrs. Cary came in a minute later, and spoke to him about his success—there had been a half-column about him in the local paper—he was a mixture of emotions. He knew now that he still wanted this girl, and he knew that the past sometimes comes back—that was all. For the rest he must be strong and watchful and he would see.

“And now,” Mrs. Cary was saying, “I want you two to go and see the lady who has the chrysanthemums. She particularly told me she wanted to see you because she'd read about you in the paper.”

They went to see the lady with the chrysanthemums. They walked along the street, and he recognized with a sort of excitement just how her shorter footsteps always fell in between his own. The lady turned out to be nice, and the chrysanthemums were enormous and extraordinarily beautiful. The lady's gardens were full of them, white and pink and yellow, so that to be among them was a trip back into the heart of summer. There were two gardens full, and a gate between them; when they strolled toward the second garden the lady went first through the gate.

And then a curious thing happened. George stepped aside to let Jonquil pass, but instead of going through she stood still and stared at him for a minute. It was not so much the look, which was not a smile, as it was the moment of silence. They saw each other's eyes, and both took a short, faintly accelerated breath, and then they went on into the second garden. That was all.

The afternoon waned. They thanked the lady and walked home slowly, thoughtfully, side by side. Through dinner too they were silent. George told Mr. Cary something of what had happened in South America, and managed to let it be known that everything would be plain sailing for him in the future.

Then dinner was over, and he and Jonquil were alone in the room which had seen the beginning of their love affair and the end. It seemed to him long ago and inexpressibly sad. On that sofa he had felt agony and grief such as he would never feel again. He would never be so weak or so tired and miserable and poor. Yet he knew that that boy of fifteen months before had had something, a trust, a warmth that was gone forever. The sensible thing—they had done the sensible thing. He had traded his first youth for strength and carved success out of despair. But with his youth, life had carried away the freshness of his love.

“You won't marry me, will you?” he said quietly.

Jonquil shook her dark head.

“I'm never going to marry,” she answered.

He nodded.

“I'm going on to Washington in the morning,” he said.

“Oh—”

“I have to go. I've got to be in New York by the first, and meanwhile I want to stop off in Washington.”

“Business!”

“No-o,” he said as if reluctantly. “There's some one there I must see who was very kind to me when I was so—down and out.”

This was invented. There was no one in Washington for him to see—but he was watching Jonquil narrowly, and he was sure that she winced a little, that her eyes closed and then opened wide again.

“But before I go I want to tell you the things that happened to me since I saw you, and, as maybe we won't meet again, I wonder if—if just this once you'd sit in my lap like you used to. I wouldn't ask except since there's no one else—yet—perhaps it doesn't matter.”

She nodded, and in a moment was sitting in his lap as she had sat so often in that vanished spring. The feel of her head against his shoulder, of her familiar body, sent a shock of emotion over him. His arms holding her had a tendency to tighten around her, so he leaned back and began to talk thoughtfully into the air.

He told her of a despairing two weeks in New York which had terminated with an attractive if not very profitable job in a construction plant in Jersey City. When the Peru business had first presented itself it had not seemed an extraordinary opportunity. He was to be third assistant engineer on the expedition, but only ten of the American party, including eight rodmen and surveyors, had ever reached Cuzco. Ten days later the chief of the expedition was dead of yellow fever. That had been his chance, a chance for anybody but a fool, a marvellous chance—

“A chance for anybody but a fool?” she interrupted innocently.

“Even for a fool,” he continued. “It was wonderful. Well, I wired New York—”

“And so,” she interrupted again, “they wired that you ought to take a chance?”

“Ought to!” he exclaimed, still leaning back. “That I had to. There was no time to lose—”

“Not a minute?”

“Not a minute.”

“Not even time for—”she paused.

“For what?”

“Look.”

He bent his head forward suddenly, and she drew herself to him in the same moment, her lips half open like a flower.

“Yes,” he whispered into her lips. “There's all the time in the world.…”

All the time in the world—his life and hers. But for an instant as he kissed her he knew that though he search through eternity he could never recapture those lost April hours. He might press her close now till the muscles knotted on his arms—she was something desirable and rare that he had fought for and made his own—but never again an intangible whisper in the dusk, or on the breeze of night.…

Well, let it pass, he thought; April is over, April is over. There are all kinds of love in the world, but never the same love twice.





THE RICH BOY


I


Begin with an individual, and before you know it you find that you have created a type; begin with a type, and you find that you have created—nothing. That is because we are all queer fish, queerer behind our faces and voices than we want any one to know or than we know ourselves. When I hear a man proclaiming himself an“average, honest, open fellow,” I feel pretty sure that he has some definite and perhaps terrible abnormality which he has agreed to conceal—and his protestation of being average and honest and open is his way of reminding himself of his misprision.

There are no types, no plurals. There is a rich boy, and this is his and not his brothers' story. All my life I have lived among his brothers but this one has been my friend. Besides, if I wrote about his brothers I should have to begin by attacking all the lies that the poor have told about the rich and the rich have told about themselves—such a wild structure they have erected that when we pick up a book about the rich, some instinct prepares us for unreality. Even the intelligent and impassioned reporters of life have made the country of the rich as unreal as fairy-land.

Let me tell you about the very rich. They are different from you and me. They possess and enjoy early, and it does something to them, makes them soft where we are hard, and cynical where we are trustful, in a way that, unless you were born rich, it is very difficult to understand. They think, deep in their hearts, that they are better than we are because we had to discover the compensations and refuges of life for ourselves. Even when they enter deep into our world or sink below us, they still think that they are better than we are. They are different. The only way I can describe young Anson Hunter is to approach him as if he were a foreigner and cling stubbornly to my point of view. If I accept his for a moment I am lost—I have nothing to show but a preposterous movie.





II


Anson was the eldest of six children who would some day divide a fortune of fifteen million dollars, and he reached the age of reason—is it seven?—at the beginning of the century when daring young women were already gliding along Fifth Avenue in electric“mobiles.” In those days he and his brother had an English governess who spoke the language very clearly and crisply and well, so that the two boys grew to speak as she did—their words and sentences were all crisp and clear and not run together as ours are. They didn't talk exactly like English children but acquired an accent that is peculiar to fashionable people in the city of New York.

In the summer the six children were moved from the house on 71st Street to a big estate in northern Connecticut. It was not a fashionable locality—Anson's father wanted to delay as long as possible his children's knowledge of that side of life. He was a man somewhat superior to his class, which composed New York society, and to his period, which was the snobbish and formalized vulgarity of the Gilded Age, and he wanted his sons to learn habits of concentration and have sound constitutions and grow up into right-living and successful men. He and his wife kept an eye on them as well as they were able until the two older boys went away to school, but in huge establishments this is difficult—it was much simpler in the series of small and medium-sized houses in which my own youth was spent—I was never far out of the reach of my mother's voice, of the sense of her presence, her approval or disapproval.

Anson's first sense of his superiority came to him when he realized the half-grudging American deference that was paid to him in the Connecticut village. The parents of the boys he played with always inquired after his father and mother, and were vaguely excited when their own children were asked to the Hunters' house. He accepted this as the natural state of things, and a sort of impatience with all groups of which he was not the center—in money, in position, in authority—remained with him for the rest of his life. He disdained to struggle with other boys for precedence—he expected it to be given him freely, and when it wasn't he withdrew into his family. His family was sufficient, for in the East money is still a somewhat feudal thing, a clan-forming thing. In the snobbish West, money separates families to form“sets.”

At eighteen, when he went to New Haven, Anson was tall and thick-set, with a clear complexion and a healthy color from the ordered life he had led in school. His hair was yellow and grew in a funny way on his head, his nose was beaked—these two things kept him from being handsome—but he had a confident charm and a certain brusque style, and the upper-class men who passed him on the street knew without being told that he was a rich boy and had gone to one of the best schools. Nevertheless, his very superiority kept him from being a success in college—the independence was mistaken for egotism, and the refusal to accept Yale standards with the proper awe seemed to belittle all those who had. So, long before he graduated, he began to shift the center of his life to New York.

He was at home in New York—there was his own house with“the kind of servants you can't get any more”—and his own family, of which, because of his good humor and a certain ability to make things go, he was rapidly becoming the center, and the débutante parties, and the correct manly world of the men's clubs, and the occasional wild spree with the gallant girls whom New Haven only knew from the fifth row. His aspirations were conventional enough—they included even the irreproachable shadow he would some day marry, but they differed from the aspirations of the majority of young men in that there was no mist over them, none of that quality which is variously known as“idealism”or“illusion.” Anson accepted without reservation the world of high finance and high extravagance, of divorce and dissipation, of snobbery and of privilege. Most of our lives end as a compromise—it was as a compromise that his life began.

He and I first met in the late summer of 1917 when he was just out of Yale, and, like the rest of us, was swept up into the systematized hysteria of the war. In the blue-green uniform of the naval aviation he came down to Pensacola, where the hotel orchestras played“I'm sorry, dear,” and we young officers danced with the girls. Every one liked him, and though he ran with the drinkers and wasn't an especially good pilot, even the instructors treated him with a certain respect. He was always having long talks with them in his confident, logical voice—talks which ended by his getting himself, or, more frequently, another officer, out of some impending trouble. He was convivial, bawdy, robustly avid for pleasure, and we were all surprised when he fell in love with a conservative and rather proper girl.

Her name was Paula Legendre, a dark, serious beauty from somewhere in California. Her family kept a winter residence just outside of town, and in spite of her primness she was enormously popular; there is a large class of men whose egotism can't endure humor in a woman. But Anson wasn't that sort, and I couldn't understand the attraction of her“sincerity”—that was the thing to say about her—for his keen and somewhat sardonic mind.

Nevertheless, they fell in love—and on her terms. He no longer joined the twilight gathering at the De Sota bar, and whenever they were seen together they were engaged in a long, serious dialogue, which must have gone on several weeks. Long afterward he told me that it was not about anything in particular but was composed on both sides of immature and even meaningless statements—the emotional content that gradually came to fill it grew up not out of the words but out of its enormous seriousness. It was a sort of hypnosis. Often it was interrupted, giving way to that emasculated humor we call fun; when they were alone it was resumed again, solemn, low-keyed, and pitched so as to give each other a sense of unity in feeling and thought. They came to resent any interruptions of it, to be unresponsive to facetiousness about life, even to the mild cynicism of their contemporaries. They were only happy when the dialogue was going on, and its seriousness bathed them like the amber glow of an open fire. Toward the end there came an interruption they did not resent—it began to be interrupted by passion.

Oddly enough, Anson was as engrossed in the dialogue as she was and as profoundly affected by it, yet at the same time aware that on his side much was insincere, and on hers much was merely simple. At first, too, he despised her emotional simplicity as well, but with his love her nature deepened and blossomed, and he could despise it no longer. He felt that if he could enter into Paula's warm safe life he would be happy. The long preparation of the dialogue removed any constraint—he taught her some of what he had learned from more adventurous women, and she responded with a rapt holy intensity. One evening after a dance they agreed to marry, and he wrote a long letter about her to his mother. The next day Paula told him that she was rich, that she had a personal fortune of nearly a million dollars.





III


It was exactly as if they could say“Neither of us has anything: we shall be poor together”—just as delightful that they should be rich instead. It gave them the same communion of adventure. Yet when Anson got leave in April, and Paula and her mother accompanied him North, she was impressed with the standing of his family in New York and with the scale on which they lived. Alone with Anson for the first time in the rooms where he had played as a boy, she was filled with a comfortable emotion, as though she were pre-eminently safe and taken care of. The pictures of Anson in a skull cap at his first school, of Anson on horseback with the sweetheart of a mysterious forgotten summer, of Anson in a gay group of ushers and bridesmaid at a wedding, made her jealous of his life apart from her in the past, and so completely did his authoritative person seem to sum up and typify these possessions of his that she was inspired with the idea of being married immediately and returning to Pensacola as his wife.

But an immediate marriage wasn't discussed—even the engagement was to be secret until after the war. When she realized that only two days of his leave remained, her dissatisfaction crystallized in the intention of making him as unwilling to wait as she was. They were driving to the country for dinner, and she determined to force the issue that night.

Now a cousin of Paula's was staying with them at the Ritz, a severe, bitter girl who loved Paula but was somewhat jealous of her impressive engagement, and as Paula was late in dressing, the cousin, who wasn't going to the party, received Anson in the parlor of the suite.

Anson had met friends at five o'clock and drunk freely and indiscreetly with them for an hour. He left the Yale Club at a proper time, and his mother's chauffeur drove him to the Ritz, but his usual capacity was not in evidence, and the impact of the steam-heated sitting-room made him suddenly dizzy. He knew it, and he was both amused and sorry.

Paula's cousin was twenty-five, but she was exceptionally naïve, and at first failed to realize what was up. She had never met Anson before, and she was surprised when he mumbled strange information and nearly fell off his chair, but until Paula appeared it didn't occur to her that what she had taken for the odor of a dry-cleaned uniform was really whiskey. But Paula understood as soon as she appeared; her only thought was to get Anson away before her mother saw him, and at the look in her eyes the cousin understood too.

When Paula and Anson descended to the limousine they found two men inside, both asleep; they were the men with whom he had been drinking at the Yale Club, and they were also going to the party. He had entirely forgotten their presence in the car. On the way to Hempstead they awoke and sang. Some of the songs were rough, and though Paula tried to reconcile herself to the fact that Anson had few verbal inhibitions, her lips tightened with shame and distaste.

Back at the hotel the cousin, confused and agitated, considered the incident, and then walked into Mrs. Legendre's bedroom, saying: “Isn't he funny?”

“Who is funny?”

“Why—Mr. Hunter. He seemed so funny.”

Mrs. Legendre looked at her sharply.

“How is he funny?”

“Why, he said he was French. I didn't know he was French.”

“That's absurd. You must have misunderstood.” She smiled: “It was a joke.”

The cousin shook her head stubbornly.

“No. He said he was brought up in France. He said he couldn't speak any English, and that's why he couldn't talk to me. And he couldn't!”

Mrs. Legendre looked away with impatience just as the cousin added thoughtfully, “Perhaps it was because he was so drunk,” and walked out of the room.

This curious report was true. Anson, finding his voice thick and uncontrollable, had taken the unusual refuge of announcing that he spoke no English. Years afterward he used to tell that part of the story, and he invariably communicated the uproarious laughter which the memory aroused in him.

Five times in the next hour Mrs. Legendre tried to get Hempstead on the phone. When she succeeded, there was a ten-minute delay before she heard Paula's voice on the wire.

“Cousin Jo told me Anson was intoxicated.”

“Oh, no.…”

“Oh, yes. Cousin Jo says he was intoxicated. He told her he was French, and fell off his chair and behaved as if he was very intoxicated. I don't want you to come home with him.”

“Mother, he's all right! Please don't worry about—”

“But I do worry. I think it's dreadful. I want you to promise me not to come home with him.”

“I'll take care of it, mother.…”

“I don't want you to come home with him.”

“All right, mother. Good-by.”

“Be sure now, Paula. Ask some one to bring you.”

Deliberately Paula took the receiver from her ear and hung it up. Her face was flushed with helpless annoyance. Anson was stretched asleep out in a bedroom up-stairs, while the dinner-party below was proceeding lamely toward conclusion.

The hour's drive had sobered him somewhat—his arrival was merely hilarious—and Paula hoped that the evening was not spoiled, after all, but two imprudent cocktails before dinner completed the disaster. He talked boisterously and somewhat offensively to the party at large for fifteen minutes, and then slid silently under the table; like a man in an old print—but, unlike an old print, it was rather horrible without being at all quaint. None of the young girls present remarked upon the incident—it seemed to merit only silence. His uncle and two other men carried him up-stairs, and it was just after this that Paula was called to the phone.

An hour later Anson awoke in a fog of nervous agony, through which he perceived after a moment the figure of his uncle Robert standing by the door.

“…I said are you better?”

“What?”

“Do you feel better, old man?”

“Terrible,” said Anson.

“I'm going to try you on another bromo-seltzer. If you can hold it down, it'll do you good to sleep.”

With an effort Anson slid his legs from the bed and stood up.

“I'm all right,” he said dully.

“Take it easy.”

“I thin' if you gave me a glassbrandy I could go down-stairs.”

“Oh, no—”

“Yes, that's the only thin'. I'm all right now.…I suppose I'm in Dutch dow' there.”

“They know you're a little under the weather,” said his uncle deprecatingly. “But don't worry about it. Schuyler didn't even get here. He passed away in the locker-room over at the Links.”

Indifferent to any opinion, except Paula's, Anson was nevertheless determined to save the débris of the evening, but when after a cold bath he made his appearance most of the party had already left. Paula got up immediately to go home.

In the limousine the old serious dialogue began. She had known that he drank, she admitted, but she had never expected anything like this—it seemed to her that perhaps they were not suited to each other, after all. Their ideas about life were too different, and so forth. When she finished speaking, Anson spoke in turn, very soberly. Then Paula said she'd have to think it over; she wouldn't decide to-night; she was not angry but she was terribly sorry. Nor would she let him come into the hotel with her, but just before she got out of the car she leaned and kissed him unhappily on the cheek.

The next afternoon Anson had a long talk with Mrs. Legendre while Paula sat listening in silence. It was agreed that Paula was to brood over the incident for a proper period and then, if mother and daughter thought it best, they would follow Anson to Pensacola. On his part he apologized with sincerity and dignity—that was all; with every card in her hand Mrs. Legendre was unable to establish any advantage over him. He made no promises, showed no humility, only delivered a few serious comments on life which brought him off with rather a moral superiority at the end. When they came South three weeks later, neither Anson in his satisfaction nor Paula in her relief at the reunion realized that the psychological moment had passed forever.





IV


He dominated and attracted her, and at the same time filled her with anxiety. Confused by his mixture of solidity and self-indulgence, of sentiment and cynicism—incongruities which her gentle mind was unable to resolve—Paula grew to think of him as two alternating personalities. When she saw him alone, or at a formal party, or with his casual inferiors, she felt a tremendous pride in his strong, attractive presence, the paternal, understanding stature of his mind. In other company she became uneasy when what had been a fine imperviousness to mere gentility showed its other face. The other face was gross, humorous, reckless of everything but pleasure. It startled her mind temporarily away from him, even led her into a short covert experiment with an old beau, but it was no use—after four months of Anson's enveloping vitality there was an anæmic pallor in all other men.

In July he was ordered abroad, and their tenderness and desire reached a crescendo. Paula considered a last-minute marriage—decided against it only because there were always cocktails on his breath now, but the parting itself made her physically ill with grief. After his departure she wrote him long letters of regret for the days of love they had missed by waiting. In August Anson's plane slipped down into the North Sea. He was pulled onto a destroyer after a night in the water and sent to hospital with pneumonia; the armistice was signed before he was finally sent home.

Then, with every opportunity given back to them, with no material obstacle to overcome, the secret weavings of their temperaments came between them, drying up their kisses and their tears, making their voices less loud to one another, muffling the intimate chatter of their hearts until the old communication was only possible by letters, from far away. One afternoon a society reporter waited for two hours in the Hunters' house for a confirmation of their engagement. Anson denied it; nevertheless an early issue carried the report as a leading paragraph—they were“constantly seen together at Southampton, Hot Springs, and Tuxedo Park.” But the serious dialogue had turned a corner into a long-sustained quarrel, and the affair was almost played out. Anson got drunk flagrantly and missed an engagement with her, whereupon Paula made certain behavioristic demands. His despair was helpless before his pride and his knowledge of himself: the engagement was definitely broken.

“Dearest,” said their letters now, “Dearest, Dearest, when I wake up in the middle of the night and realize that after all it was not to be, I feel that I want to die. I can't go on living any more. Perhaps when we meet this summer we may talk things over and decide differently—we were so excited and sad that day, and I don't feel that I can live all my life without you. You speak of other people. Don't you know there are no other people for me, but only you.…”

But as Paula drifted here and there around the East she would sometimes mention her gaieties to make him wonder. Anson was too acute to wonder. When he saw a man's name in her letters he felt more sure of her and a little disdainful—he was always superior to such things. But he still hoped that they would some day marry.

Meanwhile he plunged vigorously into all the movement and glitter of post-bellum New York, entering a brokerage house, joining half a dozen clubs, dancing late, and moving in three worlds—his own world, the world of young Yale graduates, and that section of the half-world which rests one end on Broadway. But there was always a thorough and infractible eight hours devoted to his work in Wall Street, where the combination of his influential family connection, his sharp intelligence, and his abundance of sheer physical energy brought him almost immediately forward. He had one of those invaluable minds with partitions in it; sometimes he appeared at his office refreshed by less than an hour's sleep, but such occurrences were rare. So early as 1920 his income in salary and commissions exceeded twelve thousand dollars.

As the Yale tradition slipped into the past he became more and more of a popular figure among his classmates in New York, more popular than he had ever been in college. He lived in a great house, and had the means of introducing young men into other great houses. Moreover, his life already seemed secure, while theirs, for the most part, had arrived again at precarious beginnings. They commenced to turn to him for amusement and escape, and Anson responded readily, taking pleasure in helping people and arranging their affairs.

There were no men in Paula's letters now, but a note of tenderness ran through them that had not been there before. From several sources he heard that she had“a heavy beau,” Lowell Thayer, a Bostonian of wealth and position, and though he was sure she still loved him, it made him uneasy to think that he might lose her, after all. Save for one unsatisfactory day she had not been in New York for almost five months, and as the rumors multiplied he became increasingly anxious to see her. In February he took his vacation and went down to Florida.

Palm Beach sprawled plump and opulent between the sparkling sapphire of Lake Worth, flawed here and there by house-boats at anchor, and the great turquoise bar of the Atlantic Ocean. The huge bulks of the Breakers and the Royal Poinciana rose as twin paunches from the bright level of the sand, and around them clustered the Dancing Glade, Bradley's House of Chance, and a dozen modistes and milliners with goods at triple prices from New York. Upon the trellissed veranda of the Breakers two hundred women stepped right, stepped left, wheeled, and slid in that then celebrated calisthenic known as the double-shuffle, while in half-time to the music two thousand bracelets clicked up and down on two hundred arms.

At the Everglades Club after dark Paula and Lowell Thayer and Anson and a casual fourth played bridge with hot cards. It seemed to Anson that her kind, serious face was wan and tired—she had been around now for four, five, years. He had known her for three.

“Two spades.”

“Cigarette?…Oh, I beg your pardon. By me.”

“By.”

“I'll double three spades.”

There were a dozen tables of bridge in the room, which was filling up with smoke. Anson's eyes met Paula's, held them persistently even when Thayer's glance fell between them.…

“What was bid?” he asked abstractedly.

“Rose of Washington Square”

sang the young people in the corners:

“I'm withering there

In basement air—”

The smoke banked like fog, and the opening of a door filled the room with blown swirls of ectoplasm. Little Bright Eyes streaked past the tables seeking Mr. Conan Doyle among the Englishmen who were posing as Englishmen about the lobby.

“You could cut it with a knife.”

“…cut it with a knife.”

“…a knife.”

At the end of the rubber Paula suddenly got up and spoke to Anson in a tense, low voice. With scarcely a glance at Lowell Thayer, they walked out the door and descended a long flight of stone steps—in a moment they were walking hand in hand along the moonlit beach.

“Darling, darling.…”They embraced recklessly, passionately, in a shadow.…Then Paula drew back her face to let his lips say what she wanted to hear—she could feel the words forming as they kissed again.…Again she broke away, listening, but as he pulled her close once more she realized that he had said nothing—only “Darling! Darling!” in that deep, sad whisper that always made her cry. Humbly, obediently, her emotions yielded to him and the tears streamed down her face, but her heart kept on crying: “Ask me—oh, Anson, dearest, ask me!”

“Paula.…Paula!”

The words wrung her heart like hands, and Anson, feeling her tremble, knew that emotion was enough. He need say no more, commit their destinies to no practical enigma. Why should he, when he might hold her so, biding his own time, for another year—forever? He was considering them both, her more than himself. For a moment, when she said suddenly that she must go back to her hotel, he hesitated, thinking, first, “This is the moment, after all,” and then: “No, let it wait—she is mine.…”

He had forgotten that Paula too was worn away inside with the strain of three years. Her mood passed forever in the night.

He went back to New York next morning filled with a certain restless dissatisfaction. There was a pretty débutante he knew in his car, and for two days they took their meals together. At first he told her a little about Paula and invented an esoteric incompatibility that was keeping them apart. The girl was of a wild, impulsive nature, and she was flattered by Anson's confidences. Like Kipling's soldier, he might have possessed himself of most of her before he reached New York, but luckily he was sober and kept control. Late in April, without warning, he received a telegram from Bar Harbor in which Paula told him that she was engaged to Lowell Thayer, and that they would be married immediately in Boston. What he never really believed could happen had happened at last.

Anson filled himself with whiskey that morning, and going to the office, carried on his work without a break—rather with a fear of what would happen if he stopped. In the evening he went out as usual, saying nothing of what had occurred; he was cordial, humorous, unabstracted. But one thing he could not help—for three days, in any place, in any company, he would suddenly bend his head into his hands and cry like a child.





V


In 1922 when Anson went abroad with the junior partner to investigate some London loans, the journey intimated that he was to be taken into the firm. He was twenty-seven now, a little heavy without being definitely stout, and with a manner older than his years. Old people and young people liked him and trusted him, and mothers felt safe when their daughters were in his charge, for he had a way, when he came into a room, of putting himself on a footing with the oldest and most conservative people there. “You and I,” he seemed to say, “we're solid. We understand.”

He had an instinctive and rather charitable knowledge of the weaknesses of men and women, and, like a priest, it made him the more concerned for the maintenance of outward forms. It was typical of him that every Sunday morning he taught in a fashionable Episcopal Sunday-school—even though a cold shower and a quick change into a cutaway coat were all that separated him from the wild night before. Once, by some mutual instinct, several children got up from the front row and moved to the last. He told this story frequently, and it was usually greeted with hilarious laughter.

After his father's death he was the practical head of his family, and, in effect, guided the destinies of the younger children. Through a complication his authority did not extend to his father's estate, which was administrated by his Uncle Robert, who was the horsey member of the family, a good-natured, hard-drinking member of that set which centers about Wheatley Hills.

Uncle Robert and his wife, Edna, had been great friends of Anson's youth, and the former was disappointed when his nephew's superiority failed to take a horsey form. He backed him for a city club which was the most difficult in America to enter—one could only join if one's family had“helped to build up New York”(or, in other words, were rich before 1880)—and when Anson, after his election, neglected it for the Yale Club, Uncle Robert gave him a little talk on the subject. But when on top of that Anson declined to enter Robert Hunter's own conservative and somewhat neglected brokerage house, his manner grew cooler. Like a primary teacher who has taught all he knew, he slipped out of Anson's life.

There were so many friends in Anson's life—scarcely one for whom he had not done some unusual kindness and scarcely one whom he did not occasionally embarrass by his bursts of rough conversation or his habit of getting drunk whenever and however he liked. It annoyed him when any one else blundered in that regard—about his own lapses he was always humorous. Odd things happened to him and he told them with infectious laughter.

I was working in New York that spring, and I used to lunch with him at the Yale Club, which my university was sharing until the completion of our own. I had read of Paula's marriage, and one afternoon, when I asked him about her, something moved him to tell me the story. After that he frequently invited me to family dinners at his house and behaved as though there was a special relation between us, as though with his confidence a little of that consuming memory had passed into me.

I found that despite the trusting mothers, his attitude toward girls was not indiscriminately protective. It was up to the girl—if she showed an inclination toward looseness, she must take care of herself, even with him.

“Life,” he would explain sometimes, “has made a cynic of me.”

By life he meant Paula. Sometimes, especially when he was drinking, it became a little twisted in his mind, and he thought that she had callously thrown him over.

This“cynicism,” or rather his realization that naturally fast girls were not worth sparing, led to his affair with Dolly Karger. It wasn't his only affair in those years, but it came nearest to touching him deeply, and it had a profound effect upon his attitude toward life.

Dolly was the daughter of a notorious“publicist”who had married into society. She herself grew up into the Junior League, came out at the Plaza, and went to the Assembly; and only a few old families like the Hunters could question whether or not she“belonged,” for her picture was often in the papers, and she had more enviable attention than many girls who undoubtedly did. She was dark-haired, with carmine lips and a high, lovely color, which she concealed under pinkish-gray powder all through the first year out, because high color was unfashionable—Victorian-pale was the thing to be. She wore black, severe suits and stood with her hands in her pockets leaning a little forward, with a humorous restraint on her face. She danced exquisitely—better than anything she liked to dance—better than anything except making love. Since she was ten she had always been in love, and, usually, with some boy who didn't respond to her. Those who did—and there were many—bored her after a brief encounter, but for her failures she reserved the warmest spot in her heart. When she met them she would always try once more—sometimes she succeeded, more often she failed.

It never occurred to this gypsy of the unattainable that there was a certain resemblance in those who refused to love her—they shared a hard intuition that saw through to her weakness, not a weakness of emotion but a weakness of rudder. Anson perceived this when he first met her, less than a month after Paula's marriage. He was drinking rather heavily, and he pretended for a week that he was falling in love with her. Then he dropped her abruptly and forgot—immediately he took up the commanding position in her heart.

Like so many girls of that day Dolly was slackly and indiscreetly wild. The unconventionality of a slightly older generation had been simply one facet of a post-war movement to discredit obsolete manners—Dolly's was both older and shabbier, and she saw in Anson the two extremes which the emotionally shiftless woman seeks, an abandon to indulgence alternating with a protective strength. In his character she felt both the sybarite and the solid rock, and these two satisfied every need of her nature.

She felt that it was going to be difficult, but she mistook the reason—she thought that Anson and his family expected a more spectacular marriage, but she guessed immediately that her advantage lay in his tendency to drink.

They met at the large débutante dances, but as her infatuation increased they managed to be more and more together. Like most mothers, Mrs. Karger believed that Anson was exceptionally reliable, so she allowed Dolly to go with him to distant country clubs and suburban houses without inquiring closely into their activities or questioning her explanations when they came in late. At first these explanations might have been accurate, but Dolly's worldly ideas of capturing Anson were soon engulfed in the rising sweep of her emotion. Kisses in the back of taxis and motor-cars were no longer enough; they did a curious thing:

They dropped out of their world for a while and made another world just beneath it where Anson's tippling and Dolly's irregular hours would be less noticed and commented on. It was composed, this world, of varying elements—several of Anson's Yale friends and their wives, two or three young brokers and bond salesmen and a handful of unattached men, fresh from college, with money and a propensity to dissipation. What this world lacked in spaciousness and scale it made up for by allowing them a liberty that it scarcely permitted itself. Moreover, it centered around them and permitted Dolly the pleasure of a faint condescension—a pleasure which Anson, whose whole life was a condescension from the certitudes of his childhood, was unable to share.

He was not in love with her, and in the long feverish winter of their affair he frequently told her so. In the spring he was weary—he wanted to renew his life at some other source—moreover, he saw that either he must break with her now or accept the responsibility of a definite seduction. Her family's encouraging attitude precipitated his decision—one evening when Mr. Karger knocked discreetly at the library door to announce that he had left a bottle of old brandy in the dining-room, Anson felt that life was hemming him in. That night he wrote her a short letter in which he told her that he was going on his vacation, and that in view of all the circumstances they had better meet no more.

It was June. His family had closed up the house and gone to the country, so he was living temporarily at the Yale Club. I had heard about his affair with Dolly as it developed—accounts salted with humor, for he despised unstable women, and granted them no place in the social edifice in which he believed—and when he told me that night that he was definitely breaking with her I was glad. I had seen Dolly here and there, and each time with a feeling of pity at the hopelessness of her struggle, and of shame at knowing so much about her that I had no right to know. She was what is known as“a pretty little thing,” but there was a certain recklessness which rather fascinated me. Her dedication to the goddess of waste would have been less obvious had she been less spirited—she would most certainly throw herself away, but I was glad when I heard that the sacrifice would not be consummated in my sight.

Anson was going to leave the letter of farewell at her house next morning. It was one of the few houses left open in the Fifth Avenue district, and he knew that the Kargers, acting upon erroneous information from Dolly, had foregone a trip abroad to give their daughter her chance. As he stepped out the door of the Yale Club into Madison Avenue the postman passed him, and he followed back inside. The first letter that caught his eye was in Dolly's hand.

He knew what it would be—a lonely and tragic monologue, full of the reproaches he knew, the invoked memories, the“I wonder if's”—all the immemorial intimacies that he had communicated to Paula Legendre in what seemed another age. Thumbing over some bills, he brought it on top again and opened it. To his surprise it was a short, somewhat formal note, which said that Dolly would be unable to go to the country with him for the week-end, because Perry Hull from Chicago had unexpectedly come to town. It added that Anson had brought this on himself: “—if I felt that you loved me as I love you I would go with you at any time, any place, but Perry is so nice, and he so much wants me to marry him—”

Anson smiled contemptuously—he had had experience with such decoy epistles. Moreover, he knew how Dolly had labored over this plan, probably sent for the faithful Perry and calculated the time of his arrival—even labored over the note so that it would make him jealous without driving him away. Like most compromises, it had neither force nor vitality but only a timorous despair.

Suddenly he was angry. He sat down in the lobby and read it again. Then he went to the phone, called Dolly and told her in his clear, compelling voice that he had received her note and would call for her at five o'clock as they had previously planned. Scarcely waiting for the pretended uncertainty of her“Perhaps I can see you for an hour,” he hung up the receiver and went down to his office. On the way he tore his own letter into bits and dropped it in the street.

He was not jealous—she meant nothing to him—but at her pathetic ruse everything stubborn and self-indulgent in him came to the surface. It was a presumption from a mental inferior and it could not be overlooked. If she wanted to know to whom she belonged she would see.

He was on the door-step at quarter past five. Dolly was dressed for the street, and he listened in silence to the paragraph of“I can only see you for an hour,” which she had begun on the phone.

“Put on your hat, Dolly,” he said, “we'll take a walk.”

They strolled up Madison Avenue and over to Fifth while Anson's shirt dampened upon his portly body in the deep heat. He talked little, scolding her, making no love to her, but before they had walked six blocks she was his again, apologizing for the note, offering not to see Perry at all as an atonement, offering anything. She thought that he had come because he was beginning to love her.

“I'm hot,” he said when they reached 71st Street. “This is a winter suit. If I stop by the house and change, would you mind waiting for me downstairs? I'll only be a minute.”

She was happy; the intimacy of his being hot, of any physical fact about him, thrilled her. When they came to the iron-grated door and Anson took out his key she experienced a sort of delight.

Down-stairs it was dark, and after he ascended in the lift Dolly raised a curtain and looked out through opaque lace at the houses over the way. She heard the lift machinery stop, and with the notion of teasing him pressed the button that brought it down. Then on what was more than an impulse she got into it and sent it up to what she guessed was his floor.

“Anson,” she called, laughing a little.

“Just a minute,” he answered from his bedroom…then after a brief delay: “Now you can come in.”

He had changed and was buttoning his vest. “This is my room,” he said lightly. “How do you like it?”

She caught sight of Paula's picture on the wall and stared at it in fascination, just as Paula had stared at the pictures of Anson's childish sweethearts five years before. She knew something about Paula—sometimes she tortured herself with fragments of the story.

Suddenly she came close to Anson, raising her arms. They embraced. Outside the area window a soft artificial twilight already hovered, though the sun was still bright on a back roof across the way. In half an hour the room would be quite dark. The uncalculated opportunity overwhelmed them, made them both breathless, and they clung more closely. It was eminent, inevitable. Still holding one another, they raised their heads—their eyes fell together upon Paula's picture, staring down at them from the wall.

Suddenly Anson dropped his arms, and sitting down at his desk tried the drawer with a bunch of keys.

“Like a drink?” he asked in a gruff voice.

“No, Anson.”

He poured himself half a tumbler of whiskey, swallowed it, and then opened the door into the hall.

“Come on,” he said.

Dolly hesitated.

“Anson—I'm going to the country with you tonight, after all. You understand that, don't you?”

“Of course,” he answered brusquely.

In Dolly's car they rode on to Long Island, closer in their emotions than they had ever been before. They knew what would happen—not with Paula's face to remind them that something was lacking, but when they were alone in the still, hot Long Island night they did not care.

The estate in Port Washington where they were to spend the week-end belonged to a cousin of Anson's who had married a Montana copper operator. An interminable drive began at the lodge and twisted under imported poplar saplings toward a huge, pink Spanish house. Anson had often visited there before.

After dinner they danced at the Links Club. About midnight Anson assured himself that his cousins would not leave before two—then he explained that Dolly was tired; he would take her home and return to the dance later. Trembling a little with excitement, they got into a borrowed car together and drove to Port Washington. As they reached the lodge he stopped and spoke to the night-watchman.

“When are you making a round, Carl?”

“Right away.”

“Then you'll be here till everybody's in?”

“Yes, sir.”

“All right. Listen: if any automobile, no matter whose it is, turns in at this gate, I want you to phone the house immediately.” He put a five-dollar bill into Carl's hand. “Is that clear?”

“Yes, Mr. Anson.” Being of the Old World, he neither winked nor smiled. Yet Dolly sat with her face turned slightly away.

Anson had a key. Once inside he poured a drink for both of them—Dolly left hers untouched—then he ascertained definitely the location of the phone, and found that it was within easy hearing distance of their rooms, both of which were on the first floor.

Five minutes later he knocked at the door of Dolly's room.

“Anson?” He went in, closing the door behind him. She was in bed, leaning up anxiously with elbows on the pillow; sitting beside her he took her in his arms.

“Anson, darling.”

He didn't answer.

“Anson.…Anson! I love you.…Say you love me. Say it now—can't you say it now? Even if you don't mean it?”

He did not listen. Over her head he perceived that the picture of Paula was hanging here upon this wall.

He got up and went close to it. The frame gleamed faintly with thrice-reflected moonlight—within was a blurred shadow of a face that he saw he did not know. Almost sobbing, he turned around and stared with abomination at the little figure on the bed.

“This is all foolishness,” he said thickly. “I don't know what I was thinking about. I don't love you and you'd better wait for somebody that loves you. I don't love you a bit, can't you understand?”

His voice broke, and he went hurriedly out. Back in the salon he was pouring himself a drink with uneasy fingers, when the front door opened suddenly, and his cousin came in.

“Why, Anson, I hear Dolly's sick,” she began solicitously. “I hear she's sick.…”

“It was nothing,” he interrupted, raising his voice so that it would carry into Dolly's room. “She was a little tired. She went to bed.”

For a long time afterward Anson believed that a protective God sometimes interfered in human affairs. But Dolly Karger, lying awake and staring at the ceiling, never again believed in anything at all.





VI


When Dolly married during the following autumn, Anson was in London on business. Like Paula's marriage, it was sudden, but it affected him in a different way. At first he felt that it was funny, and had an inclination to laugh when he thought of it. Later it depressed him—it made him feel old.

There was something repetitive about it—why, Paula and Dolly had belonged to different generations. He had a foretaste of the sensation of a man of forty who hears that the daughter of an old flame has married. He wired congratulations and, as was not the case with Paula, they were sincere—he had never really hoped that Paula would be happy.

When he returned to New York, he was made a partner in the firm, and, as his responsibilities increased, he had less time on his hands. The refusal of a life-insurance company to issue him a policy made such an impression on him that he stopped drinking for a year, and claimed that he felt better physically, though I think he missed the convivial recounting of those Celliniesque adventures which, in his early twenties, had played such a part of his life. But he never abandoned the Yale Club. He was a figure there, a personality, and the tendency of his class, who were now seven years out of college, to drift away to more sober haunts was checked by his presence.

His day was never too full nor his mind too weary to give any sort of aid to any one who asked it. What had been done at first through pride and superiority had become a habit and a passion. And there was always something—a younger brother in trouble at New Haven, a quarrel to be patched up between a friend and his wife, a position to be found for this man, an investment for that. But his specialty was the solving of problems for young married people. Young married people fascinated him and their apartments were almost sacred to him—he knew the story of their love-affair, advised them where to live and how, and remembered their babies' names. Toward young wives his attitude was circumspect: he never abused the trust which their husbands—strangely enough in view of his unconcealed irregularities—invariably reposed in him.

He came to take a vicarious pleasure in happy marriages, and to be inspired to an almost equally pleasant melancholy by those that went astray. Not a season passed that he did not witness the collapse of an affair that perhaps he himself had fathered. When Paula was divorced and almost immediately remarried to another Bostonian, he talked about her to me all one afternoon. He would never love any one as he had loved Paula, but he insisted that he no longer cared.

“I'll never marry,” he came to say; “I've seen too much of it, and I know a happy marriage is a very rare thing. Besides, I'm too old.”

But he did believe in marriage. Like all men who spring from a happy and successful marriage, he believed in it passionately—nothing he had seen would change his belief, his cynicism dissolved upon it like air. But he did really believe he was too old. At twenty-eight he began to accept with equanimity the prospect of marrying without romantic love; he resolutely chose a New York girl of his own class, pretty, intelligent, congenial, above reproach—and set about falling in love with her. The things he had said to Paula with sincerity, to other girls with grace, he could no longer say at all without smiling, or with the force necessary to convince.

“When I'm forty,” he told his friends, “I'll be ripe. I'll fall for some chorus girl like the rest.”

Nevertheless, he persisted in his attempt. His mother wanted to see him married, and he could now well afford it—he had a seat on the Stock Exchange, and his earned income came to twenty-five thousand a year.The idea was agreeable: when his friends—he spent most of his time with the set he and Dolly had evolved—closed themselves in behind domestic doors at night, he no longer rejoiced in his freedom. He even wondered if he should have married Dolly. Not even Paula had loved him more, and he was learning the rarity, in a single life, of encountering true emotion.

Just as this mood began to creep over him a disquieting story reached his ear. His aunt Edna, a woman just this side of forty, was carrying on an open intrigue with a dissolute, hard-drinking young man named Cary Sloane. Every one knew of it except Anson's Uncle Robert, who for fifteen years had talked long in clubs and taken his wife for granted.

Anson heard the story again and again with increasing annoyance. Something of his old feeling for his uncle came back to him, a feeling that was more than personal, a reversion toward that family solidarity on which he had based his pride. His intuition singled out the essential point of the affair, which was that his uncle shouldn't be hurt. It was his first experiment in unsolicited meddling, but with his knowledge of Edna's character he felt that he could handle the matter better than a district judge or his uncle.

His uncle was in Hot Springs. Anson traced down the sources of the scandal so that there should be no possibility of mistake and then he called Edna and asked her to lunch with him at the Plaza next day. Something in his tone must have frightened her, for she was reluctant, but he insisted, putting off the date until she had no excuse for refusing.

She met him at the appointed time in the Plaza lobby, a lovely, faded, gray-eyed blonde in a coat of Russian sable. Five great rings, cold with diamonds and emeralds, sparkled on her slender hands. It occurred to Anson that it was his father's intelligence and not his uncle's that had earned the fur and the stones, the rich brilliance that buoyed up her passing beauty.

Though Edna scented his hostility, she was unprepared for the directness of his approach.

“Edna, I'm astonished at the way you've been acting,” he said in a strong, frank voice. “At first I couldn't believe it.”

“Believe what?” she demanded sharply.

“You needn't pretend with me, Edna. I'm talking about Cary Sloane. Aside from any other consideration, I didn't think you could treat Uncle Robert—”

“Now look here, Anson—”she began angrily, but his peremptory voice broke through hers:

“—and your children in such a way. You've been married eighteen years, and you're old enough to know better.”

“You can't talk to me like that! You—”

“Yes, I can. Uncle Robert has always been my best friend.” He was tremendously moved. He felt a real distress about his uncle, about his three young cousins.

Edna stood up, leaving her crab-flake cocktail untasted.

“This is the silliest thing—”

“Very well, if you won't listen to me I'll go to Uncle Robert and tell him the whole story—he's bound to hear it sooner or later. And afterward I'll go to old Moses Sloane.”

Edna faltered back into her chair.

“Don't talk so loud,” she begged him. Her eyes blurred with tears. “You have no idea how your voice carries. You might have chosen a less public place to make all these crazy accusations.”

He didn't answer.

“Oh, you never liked me, I know,” she went on. “You're just taking advantage of some silly gossip to try and break up the only interesting friendship I've ever had. What did I ever do to make you hate me so?”

Still Anson waited. There would be the appeal to his chivalry, then to his pity, finally to his superior sophistication—when he had shouldered his way through all these there would be admissions, and he could come to grips with her. By being silent, by being impervious, by returning constantly to his main weapon, which was his own true emotion, he bullied her into frantic despair as the luncheon hour slipped away. At two o'clock she took out a mirror and a handkerchief, shined away the marks of her tears and powdered the slight hollows where they had lain. She had agreed to meet him at her own house at five.

When he arrived she was stretched on a chaise-longue which was covered with cretonne for the summer, and the tears he had called up at luncheon seemed still to be standing in her eyes. Then he was aware of Cary Sloane's dark anxious presence upon the cold hearth.

“What's this idea of yours?” broke out Sloane immediately. “I understand you invited Edna to lunch and then threatened her on the basis of some cheap scandal.”

Anson sat down.

“I have no reason to think it's only scandal.”

“I hear you're going to take it to Robert Hunter, and to my father.”

Anson nodded.

“Either you break it off—or I will,” he said.

“What God damned business is it of yours, Hunter?”

“Don't lose your temper, Cary,” said Edna nervously. “It's only a question of showing him how absurd—”

“For one thing, it's my name that's being handed around,” interrupted Anson. “That's all that concerns you, Cary.”

“Edna isn't a member of your family.”

“She most certainly is!” His anger mounted. “Why—she owes this house and the rings on her fingers to my father's brains. When Uncle Robert married her she didn't have a penny.”

They all looked at the rings as if they had a significant bearing on the situation. Edna made a gesture to take them from her hand.

“I guess they're not the only rings in the world,” said Sloane.

“Oh, this is absurd,” cried Edna. “Anson, will you listen to me? I've found out how the silly story started. It was a maid I discharged who went right to the Chilicheffs—all these Russians pump things out of their servants and then put a false meaning on them.” She brought down her fist angrily on the table: “And after Tom lent them the limousine for a whole month when we were South last winter—”

“Do you see?” demanded Sloane eagerly. “This maid got hold of the wrong end of the thing. She knew that Edna and I were friends, and she carried it to the Chilicheffs. In Russia they assume that if a man and a woman—”

He enlarged the theme to a disquisition upon social relations in the Caucasus.

“If that's the case it better be explained to Uncle Robert,” said Anson dryly, “so that when the rumors do reach him he'll know they're not true.”

Adopting the method he had followed with Edna at luncheon he let them explain it all away. He knew that they were guilty and that presently they would cross the line from explanation into justification and convict themselves more definitely than he could ever do. By seven they had taken the desperate step of telling him the truth—Robert Hunter's neglect, Edna's empty life, the casual dalliance that had flamed up into passion—but like so many true stories it had the misfortune of being old, and its enfeebled body beat helplessly against the armor of Anson's will. The threat to go to Sloane's father sealed their helplessness, for the latter, a retired cotton broker out of Alabama, was a notorious fundamentalist who controlled his son by a rigid allowance and the promise that at his next vagary the allowance would stop forever.

They dined at a small French restaurant, and the discussion continued—at one time Sloane resorted to physical threats, a little later they were both imploring him to give them time. But Anson was obdurate. He saw that Edna was breaking up, and that her spirit must not be refreshed by any renewal of their passion.

At two o'clock in a small night-club on 53d Street, Edna's nerves suddenly collapsed, and she cried to go home. Sloane had been drinking heavily all evening, and he was faintly maudlin, leaning on the table and weeping a little with his face in his hands. Quickly Anson gave them his terms. Sloane was to leave town for six months, and he must be gone within forty-eight hours. When he returned there was to be no resumption of the affair, but at the end of a year Edna might, if she wished, tell Robert Hunter that she wanted a divorce and go about it in the usual way.

He paused, gaining confidence from their faces for his final word.

“Or there's another thing you can do,” he said slowly, “if Edna wants to leave her children, there's nothing I can do to prevent your running off together.”

“I want to go home!” cried Edna again. “Oh, haven't you done enough to us for one day?”

Outside it was dark, save for a blurred glow from Sixth Avenue down the street. In that light those two who had been lovers looked for the last time into each other's tragic faces, realizing that between them there was not enough youth and strength to avert their eternal parting. Sloane walked suddenly off down the street and Anson tapped a dozing taxi-driver on the arm.

It was almost four; there was a patient flow of cleaning water along the ghostly pavement of Fifth Avenue, and the shadows of two night women flitted over the dark façade of St. Thomas's church. Then the desolate shrubbery of Central Park where Anson had often played as a child, and the mounting numbers, significant as names, of the marching streets. This was his city, he thought, where his name had flourished through five generations. No change could alter the permanence of its place here, for change itself was the essential substratum by which he and those of his name identified themselves with the spirit of New York. Resourcefulness and a powerful will—for his threats in weaker hands would have been less than nothing—had beaten the gathering dust from his uncle's name, from the name of his family, from even this shivering figure that sat beside him in the car.

Cary Sloane's body was found next morning on the lower shelf of a pillar of Queensboro Bridge. In the darkness and in his excitement he had thought that it was the water flowing black beneath him, but in less than a second it made no possible difference—unless he had planned to think one last thought of Edna, and call out her name as he struggled feebly in the water.





VII


Anson never blamed himself for his part in this affair—the situation which brought it about had not been of his making. But the just suffer with the unjust, and he found that his oldest and somehow his most precious friendship was over. He never knew what distorted story Edna told, but he was welcome in his uncle's house no longer.

Just before Christmas Mrs. Hunter retired to a select Episcopal heaven, and Anson became the responsible head of his family. An unmarried aunt who had lived with them for years ran the house, and attempted with helpless inefficiency to chaperone the younger girls. All the children were less self-reliant than Anson, more conventional both in their virtues and in their shortcomings. Mrs. Hunter's death had postponed the début of one daughter and the wedding of another. Also it had taken something deeply material from all of them, for with her passing the quiet, expensive superiority of the Hunters came to an end.

For one thing, the estate, considerably diminished by two inheritance taxes and soon to be divided among six children, was not a notable fortune any more. Anson saw a tendency in his youngest sisters to speak rather respectfully of families that hadn't“existed”twenty years ago. His own feeling of precedence was not echoed in them—sometimes they were conventionally snobbish, that was all. For another thing, this was the last summer they would spend on the Connecticut estate; the clamor against it was too loud: “Who wants to waste the best months of the year shut up in that dead old town?” Reluctantly he yielded—the house would go into the market in the fall, and next summer they would rent a smaller place in Westchester County. It was a step down from the expensive simplicity of his father's idea, and, while he sympathized with the revolt, it also annoyed him; during his mother's lifetime he had gone up there at least every other week-end—even in the gayest summers.

Yet he himself was part of this change, and his strong instinct for life had turned him in his twenties from the hollow obsequies of that abortive leisure class. He did not see this clearly—he still felt that there was a norm, a standard of society. But there was no norm, it was doubtful if there had ever been a true norm in New York. The few who still paid and fought to enter a particular set succeeded only to find that as a society it scarcely functioned—or, what was more alarming, that the Bohemia from which they fled sat above them at table.

At twenty-nine Anson's chief concern was his own growing loneliness. He was sure now that he would never marry. The number of weddings at which he had officiated as best man or usher was past all counting—there was a drawer at home that bulged with the official neckties of this or that wedding-party, neckties standing for romances that had not endured a year, for couples who had passed completely from his life. Scarf-pins, gold pencils, cuff-buttons, presents from a generation of grooms had passed through his jewel-box and been lost—and with every ceremony he was less and less able to imagine himself in the groom's place. Under his hearty good-will toward all those marriages there was despair about his own.

And as he neared thirty he became not a little depressed at the inroads that marriage, especially lately, had made upon his friendships. Groups of people had a disconcerting tendency to dissolve and disappear. The men from his own college—and it was upon them he had expended the most time and affection—were the most elusive of all. Most of them were drawn deep into domesticity, two were dead, one lived abroad, one was in Hollywood writing continuities for pictures that Anson went faithfully to see.

Most of them, however, were permanent commuters with an intricate family life centering around some suburban country club, and it was from these that he felt his estrangement most keenly.

In the early days of their married life they had all needed him; he gave them advice about their slim finances, he exorcised their doubts about the advisability of bringing a baby into two rooms and a bath, especially he stood for the great world outside. But now their financial troubles were in the past and the fearfully expected child had evolved into an absorbing family. They were always glad to see old Anson, but they dressed up for him and tried to impress him with their present importance, and kept their troubles to themselves. They needed him no longer.

A few weeks before his thirtieth birthday the last of his early and intimate friends was married. Anson acted in his usual rôle of best man, gave his usual silver tea-service, and went down to the usual Homeric to say good-by. It was a hot Friday afternoon in May, and as he walked from the pier he realized that Saturday closing had begun and he was free until Monday morning.

“Go where?” he asked himself.

The Yale Club, of course; bridge until dinner, then four or fiveraw cocktails in somebody's room and a pleasant confused evening. He regretted that this afternoon's groom wouldn't be along—they had always been able to cram so much into such nights: they knew how to attach women and how to get rid of them, how much consideration any girl deserved from their intelligent hedonism. A party was an adjusted thing—you took certain girls to certain places and spent just so much on their amusement; you drank a little, not much, more than you ought to drink, and at a certain time in the morning you stood up and said you were going home. You avoided college boys, sponges, future engagements, fights, sentiment, and indiscretions. That was the way it was done. All the rest was dissipation.

In the morning you were never violently sorry—you made no resolutions, but if you had overdone it and your heart was slightly out of order, you went on the wagon for a few days without saying anything about it, and waited until an accumulation of nervous boredom projected you into another party.

The lobby of the Yale Club was unpopulated. In the bar three very young alumni looked up at him, momentarily and without curiosity.

“Hello there, Oscar,” he said to the bartender. “Mr. Cahill been around this afternoon?”

“Mr. Cahill's gone to New Haven.”

“Oh…that so?”

“Gone to the ball game. Lot of men gone up.”

Anson looked once again into the lobby, considered for a moment, and then walked out and over to Fifth Avenue. From the broad window of one of his clubs—one that he had scarcely visited in five years—a gray man with watery eyes stared down at him. Anson looked quickly away—that figure sitting in vacant resignation, in supercilious solitude, depressed him. He stopped and, retracing his steps, started over 47th Street toward Teak Warden's apartment. Teak and his wife had once been his most familiar friends—it was a household where he and Dolly Karger had been used to go in the days of their affair. But Teak had taken to drink, and his wife had remarked publicly that Anson was a bad influence on him. The remark reached Anson in an exaggerated form—when it was finallycleared up, the delicate spell of intimacy was broken, never to be renewed.

“Is Mr. Warden at home?” he inquired.

“They've gone to the country.”

The fact unexpectedly cut at him. They were gone to the country and he hadn't known. Two years before he would have known the date, the hour, come up at the last moment for a final drink, and planned his first visit to them. Now they had gone without a word.

Anson looked at his watch and considered a week-end with his family, but the only train was a local that would jolt through the aggressive heat for three hours. And to-morrow in the country, and Sunday—he was in no mood for porch-bridge with polite undergraduates, and dancing after dinner at a rural roadhouse, a diminutive of gaiety which his father had estimated too well.

“Oh, no,” he said to himself.…“No.”

He was a dignified, impressive young man, rather stout now, but otherwise unmarked by dissipation. He could have been cast for a pillar of something—at times you were sure it was not society, at others nothing else—for the law, for the church. He stood for a few minutes motionless on the sidewalk in front of a 47th Street apartment-house; for almost the first time in his life he had nothing whatever to do.

Then he began to walk briskly up Fifth Avenue, as if he had just been reminded of an important engagement there. The necessity of dissimulation is one of the few characteristics that we share with dogs, and I think of Anson on that day as some well-bred specimen who had been disappointed at a familiar back door. He was going to see Nick, once a fashionable bartender in demand at all private dances, and now employed in cooling non-alcoholic champagne among the labyrinthine cellars of the Plaza Hotel.

“Nick,” he said, “what's happened to everything?”

“Dead,” Nick said.

“Make me a whiskey sour.” Anson handed a pint bottle over the counter. “Nick, the girls are different; I had a little girl in Brooklyn and she got married last week without letting me know.”

“That a fact? Ha-ha-ha,” responded Nick diplomatically. “Slipped it over on you.”

“Absolutely,” said Anson. “And I was out with her the night before.”

“Ha-ha-ha,” said Nick, “ha-ha-ha!”

“Do you remember the wedding, Nick, in Hot Springs where I had the waiters and the musicians singing ‘God save the King’?”

“Now where was that, Mr. Hunter?” Nick concentrated doubtfully. “Seems to me that was—”

“Next time they were back for more, and I began to wonder how much I'd paid them,” continued Anson.

“—seems to me that was at Mr. Trenholm's wedding.”

“Don't know him,” said Anson decisively. He was offended that a strange name should intrude upon his reminiscences; Nick perceived this.

“Naw—aw—”he admitted, “I ought to know that. It was one of your crowd—Brakins…Baker—”

“Bicker Baker,” said Anson responsively. “They put me in a hearse after it was over and covered me up with flowers and drove me away.”

“Ha-ha-ha,” said Nick. “Ha-ha-ha.”

Nick's simulation of the old family servant paled presently and Anson went up-stairs to the lobby. He looked around—his eyes met the glance of an unfamiliar clerk at the desk, then fell upon a flower from the morning's marriage hesitating in the mouth of a brass cuspidor. He went out and walked slowly toward the blood-red sun over Columbus Circle. Suddenly he turned around and, retracing his steps to the Plaza, immured himself in a telephone-booth.

Later he said that he tried to get me three times that afternoon, that he tried every one who might be in New York—men and girls he had not seen for years, an artist's model of his college days whose faded number was still in his address book—Central told him that even the exchange existed no longer. At length his quest roved into the country, and he held brief disappointing conversations with emphatic butlers and maids. So-and-so was out, riding, swimming, playing golf, sailed to Europe last week. Who shall I say phoned?

It was intolerable that he should pass the evening alone—the private reckonings which one plans for a moment of leisure lose every charm when the solitude is enforced. There were always women of a sort, but the ones he knew had temporarily vanished, and to pass a New York evening in the hired company of a stranger never occurred to him—he would have considered that that was something shameful and secret, the diversion of a traveling salesman in a strange town.

Anson paid the telephone bill—the girl tried unsuccessfully to joke with him about its size—and for the second time that afternoon started to leave the Plaza and go he knew not where. Near the revolving door the figure of a woman, obviously with child, stood sideways to the light—a sheer beige cape fluttered at her shoulders when the door turned and, each time, she looked impatiently toward it as if she were weary of waiting. At the first sight of her a strong nervous thrill of familiarity went over him, but not until he was within five feet of her did he realize that it was Paula.

“Why, Anson Hunter!”

His heart turned over.

“Why, Paula—”

“Why, this is wonderful. I can't believe it, Anson!”

She took both his hands, and he saw in the freedom of the gesture that the memory of him had lost poignancy to her. But not to him—he felt that old mood that she evoked in him stealing over his brain, that gentleness with which he had always met her optimism as if afraid to mar its surface.

“We're at Rye for the summer. Pete had to come East on business—you know of course I'm Mrs. Peter Hagerty now—so we brought the children and took a house. You've got to come out and see us.”

“Can I?” he asked directly. “When?”

“When you like. Here's Pete.” The revolving door functioned, giving up a fine tall man of thirty with a tanned face and a trim mustache. His immaculate fitness made a sharp contrast with Anson's increasing bulk, which was obvious under the faintly tight cut-away coat.

“You oughtn't to be standing,” said Hagerty to his wife. “Let's sit down here.” He indicated lobby chairs, but Paula hesitated.

“I've got to go right home,” she said. “Anson, why don't you—why don't you come out and have dinner with us to-night? We're just getting settled, but if you can stand that—”

Hagerty confirmed the invitation cordially.

“Come out for the night.”

Their car waited in front of the hotel, and Paula with a tired gesture sank back against silk cushions in the corner.

“There's so much I want to talk to you about,” she said, “it seems hopeless.”

“I want to hear about you.”

“Well”—she smiled at Hagerty—“that would take a long time too. I have three children—by my first marriage. The oldest is five, then four, then three.” She smiled again. “I didn't waste much time having them, did I?”

“Boys?”

“A boy and two girls. Then—oh, a lot of things happened, and I got a divorce in Paris a year ago and married Pete. That's all—except that I'm awfully happy.”

In Rye they drove up to a large house near the Beach Club, from which there issued presently three dark, slim children who broke from an English governess and approached them with an esoteric cry. Abstractedly and with difficulty Paula took each one into her arms, a caress which they accepted stiffly, as they had evidently been told not to bump into Mummy. Even against their fresh faces Paula's skin showed scarcely any weariness—for all her physical languor she seemed younger than when he had last seen her at Palm Beach seven years ago.

At dinner she was preoccupied, and afterward, during the homage to the radio, she lay with closed eyes on the sofa, until Anson wondered if his presence at this time were not an intrusion. But at nine o'clock, when Hagerty rose and said pleasantly that he was going to leave them by themselves for a while, she began to talk slowly about herself and the past.

“My first baby,” she said—“the one we call Darling, the biggest little girl—I wanted to die when I knew I was going to have her, because Lowell was like a stranger to me. It didn't seem as though she could be my own. I wrote you a letter and tore it up. Oh, you were so bad to me, Anson.”

It was the dialogue again, rising and falling. Anson felt a sudden quickening of memory.

“Weren't you engaged once?” she asked—“a girl named Dolly something?”

“I wasn't ever engaged. I tried to be engaged, but I never loved anybody but you, Paula.”

“Oh,” she said. Then after a moment: “This baby is the first one I ever really wanted. You see, I'm in love now—at last.”

He didn't answer, shocked at the treachery of her remembrance. She must have seen that the“at last”bruised him, for she continued:

“I was infatuated with you, Anson—you could make me do anything you liked. But we wouldn't have been happy. I'm not smart enough for you. I don't like things to be complicated like you do.” She paused. “You'll never settle down,” she said.

The phrase struck at him from behind—it was an accusation that of all accusations he had never merited.

“I could settle down if women were different,” he said. “If I didn't understand so much about them, if women didn't spoil you for other women, if they had only a little pride. If I could go to sleep for a while and wake up into a home that was really mine—why, that's what I'm made for, Paula, that's what women have seen in me and liked in me. It's only that I can't get through the preliminaries any more.”

Hagerty came in a little before eleven; after a whiskey Paula stood up and announced that she was going to bed. She went over and stood by her husband.

“Where did you go, dearest?” she demanded.

“I had a drink with Ed Saunders.”

“I was worried. I thought maybe you'd run away.”

She rested her head against his coat.

“He's sweet, isn't he, Anson?” she demanded.

“Absolutely,” said Anson, laughing.

She raised her face to her husband.

“Well, I'm ready,” she said. She turned to Anson: “Do you want tosee our family gymnastic stunt?”

“Yes,” he said in an interested voice.

“All right. Here we go!”

Hagerty picked her up easily in his arms.

“This is called the family acrobatic stunt,” said Paula. “He carries me up-stairs. Isn't it sweet of him?”

“Yes,” said Anson.

Hagerty bent his head slightly until his face touched Paula's.

“And I love him,” she said. “I've just been telling you, haven't I, Anson?”

“Yes,” he said.

“He's the dearest thing that ever lived in this world; aren't you, darling?…Well, good night. Here we go. Isn't he strong?”

“Yes,” Anson said.

“You'll find a pair of Pete's pajamas laid out for you. Sweet dreams—see you at breakfast.”

“Yes,” Anson said.





VIII


The older members of the firm insisted that Anson should go abroad for the summer. He had scarcely had a vacation in seven years, they said. He was stale and needed a change. Anson resisted.

“If I go,” he declared, “I won't come back any more.”

“That's absurd, old man. You'll be back in three months with all this depression gone. Fit as ever.”

“No.” He shook his head stubbornly. “If I stop, I won't go back to work. If I stop, that means I've given up—I'm through.”

“We'll take a chance on that. Stay six months if you like—we're not afraid you'll leave us. Why, you'd be miserable if you didn't work.”

They arranged his passage for him. They liked Anson—every one liked Anson—and the change that had been coming over him cast a sort of pall over the office. The enthusiasm that had invariably signalled up business, the consideration toward his equals and his inferiors, the lift of his vital presence—within the past four months his intense nervousness had melted down these qualities into the fussy pessimism of a man of forty. On every transaction in which he was involved he acted as a drag and a strain.

“If I go I'll never come back,” he said.

Three days before he sailed Paula Legendre Hagerty died in childbirth. I was with him a great deal then, for we were crossing together, but for the first time in our friendship he told me not a word of how he felt, nor did I see the slightest sign of emotion. His chief preoccupation was with the fact that he was thirty years old—he would turn the conversation to the point where he could remind you of it and then fall silent, as if he assumed that the statement would start a chain of thought sufficient to itself. Like his partners, I was amazed at the change in him, and I was glad when the Paris moved off into the wet space between the worlds, leaving his principality behind.

“How about a drink?” he suggested.

We walked into the bar with that defiant feeling that characterizes the day of departure and ordered four Martinis. After one cocktail a change came over him—he suddenly reached across and slapped my knee with the first joviality I had seen him exhibit for months.

“Did you see that girl in the red tam?” he demanded, “the one with the high color who had the two police dogs down to bid her good-by.”

“She's pretty,” I agreed.

“I looked her up in the purser's office and found out that she's alone. I'm going down to see the steward in a few minutes. We'll have dinner with her to-night.”

After a while he left me, and within an hour he was walking up and down the deck with her, talking to her in his strong, clear voice. Her red tam was a bright spot of color against the steel-green sea, and from time to time she looked up with a flashing bob of her head, and smiled with amusement and interest, and anticipation. At dinner we had champagne, and were very joyous—afterward Anson ran the pool with infectious gusto, and several people who had seen me with him asked me his name. He and the girl were talking and laughing together on a lounge in the bar when I went to bed.

I saw less of him on the trip than I had hoped. He wanted to arrange a foursome, but there was no one available, so I saw him only at meals. Sometimes, though, he would have a cocktail in the bar, and he told me about the girl in the red tam, and his adventures with her, making them all bizarre and amusing, as he had a way of doing, and I was glad that he was himself again, or at least the self that I knew, and with which I felt at home. I don't think he was ever happy unless some one was in love with him, responding to him like filings to a magnet, helping him to explain himself, promising him something. What it was I do not know. Perhaps they promised that there would always be women in the world who would spend their brightest, freshest, rarest hours to nurse and protect that superiority he cherished in his heart.





BABYLON REVISITED


“And where's Mr. Campbell?” Charlie asked.

“Gone to Switzerland. Mr. Campbell's a pretty sick man, Mr. Wales.”

“I'm sorry to hear that. And George Hardt?” Charlie inquired.

“Back in America, gone to work.”

“And where is the Snow Bird?”

“He was in here last week. Anyway, his friend, Mr. Schaeffer, is in Paris.”

Two familiar names from the long list of a year and a half ago. Charlie scribbled an address in his notebook and tore out the page.

“If you see Mr. Schaeffer, give him this,” he said. “It's my brother-in-law's address. I haven't settled on a hotel yet.”

He was not really disappointed to find Paris was so empty. But the stillness in the Ritz bar was strange and portentous. It was not an American bar any more—he felt polite in it, and not as if he owned it. It had gone back into France. He felt the stillness from the moment he got out of the taxi and saw the doorman, usually in a frenzy of activity at this hour, gossiping with a chasseur by the servants' entrance.

Passing through the corridor, he heard only a single, bored voice in the once-clamorous women's room. When he turned into the bar he traveled the twenty feet of green carpet with his eyes fixed straight ahead by old habit; and then, with his foot firmly on the rail, he turned and surveyed the room, encountering only a single pair of eyes that fluttered up from a newspaper in the corner. Charlie asked for the head barman, Paul, who in the latter days of the bull market had come to work in his own custom-built car—disembarking, however, with due nicety at the nearest corner. But Paul was at his country house today and Alix giving him information.

“No, no more,” Charlie said, “I'm going slow these days.”

Alix congratulated him: “You were going pretty strong a couple of years ago.”

“I'll stick to it all right,” Charlie assured him. “I've stuck to it for over a year and a half now.”

“How do you find conditions in America?”

“I haven't been to America for months. I'm in business in Prague, representing a couple of concerns there. They don't know about me down there.”

Alix smiled.

“Remember the night of George Hardt's bachelor dinner here?” said Charlie. “By the way, what's become of Claude Fessenden?”

Alix lowered his voice confidentially: “He's in Paris, but he doesn't come here any more. Paul doesn't allow it. He ran up a bill of thirty thousand francs, charging all his drinks and his lunches, and usually his dinner, for more than a year. And when Paul finally told him he had to pay, he gave him a bad check.”

Alix shook his head sadly.

“I don't understand it, such a dandy fellow. Now he's all bloated up—”He made a plump apple of his hands.

Charlie watched a group of strident queens installing themselves in a corner.

“Nothing affects them,” he thought. “Stocks rise and fall, people loaf or work, but they go on forever.” The place oppressed him. He called for the dice and shook with Alix for the drink.

“Here for long, Mr. Wales?”

“I'm here for four or five days to see my little girl.”

“Oh-h! You have a little girl?”

Outside, the fire-red, gas-blue, ghost-green signs shone smokily through the tranquil rain. It was late afternoon and the streets were in movement; the bistros gleamed. At the corner of the Boulevard des Capucines he took a taxi. The Place de la Concorde moved by in pink majesty; they crossed the logical Seine, and Charlie felt the sudden provincial quality of the Left Bank.

Charlie directed his taxi to the Avenue de l'Opera, which was out of his way. But he wanted to see the blue hour spread over the magnificent façade, and imagine that the cab horns, playing endlessly the first few bars of Le Plus que Lent, were the trumpets of the Second Empire. They were closing the iron grill in front of Brentano's Book-store, and people were already at dinner behind the trim little bourgeois hedge of Duval's. He had never eaten at a really cheap restaurant in Paris. Five-course dinner, four francs fifty, eighteen cents, wine included. For some odd reason he wished that he had.

As they rolled on to the Left Bank and he felt its sudden provincialism, he thought, “I spoiled this city for myself. I didn't realize it, but the days came along one after another, and then two years were gone, and everything was gone, and I was gone.”

He was thirty-five, and good to look at. The Irish mobility of his face was sobered by a deep wrinkle between his eyes. As he rang his brother-in-law's bell in the Rue Palatine, the wrinkle deepened till it pulled down his brows; he felt a cramping sensation in his belly. From behind the maid who opened the door darted a lovely little girl of nine who shrieked“Daddy!” and flew up, struggling like a fish, into his arms. She pulled his head around by one ear and set her cheek against his.

“My old pie,” he said.

“Oh, daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy, dads, dads, dads!”

She drew him into the salon, where the family waited, a boy and girl his daughter's age, his sister-in-law and her husband. He greeted Marion with his voice pitched carefully to avoid either feigned enthusiasm or dislike, but her response was more frankly tepid, though she minimized her expression of unalterable distrust by directing her regard toward his child. The two men clasped hands in a friendly way and Lincoln Peters rested his for a moment on Charlie's shoulder.

The room was warm and comfortably American. The three children moved intimately about, playing through the yellow oblongs that led to other rooms; the cheer of six o'clock spoke in the eager smacks of the fire and the sounds of French activity in the kitchen. But Charlie did not relax; his heart sat up rigidly in his body and he drew confidence from his daughter, who from time to time came close to him, holding in her arms the doll he had brought.

“Really extremely well,” he declared in answer to Lincoln's question. “There's a lot of business there that isn't moving at all, but we're doing even better than ever. In fact, damn well. I'm bringing my sister over from America next month to keep house for me. My income last year was bigger than it was when I had money. You see, the Czechs—”

His boasting was for a specific purpose; but after a moment, seeing a faint restiveness in Lincoln's eye, he changed the subject:

“Those are fine children of yours, well brought up, good manners.”

“We think Honoria's a great little girl too.”

Marion Peters came back from the kitchen. She was a tall woman with worried eyes, who had once possessed a fresh American loveliness. Charlie had never been sensitive to it and was always surprised when people spoke of how pretty she had been. From the first there had been an instinctive antipathy between them.

“Well, how do you find Honoria?” she asked.

“Wonderful. I was astonished how much she's grown in ten months. All the children are looking well.”

“We haven't had a doctor for a year. How do you like being back in Paris?”

“It seems very funny to see so few Americans around.”

“I'm delighted,” Marion said vehemently. “Now at least you can go into a store without their assuming you're a millionaire. We've suffered like everybody, but on the whole it's a good deal pleasanter.”

“But it was nice while it lasted,” Charlie said. “We were a sort of royalty, almost infallible, with a sort of magic around us. In the bar this afternoon”—he stumbled, seeing his mistake—“there wasn't a man I knew.”

She looked at him keenly. “I should think you'd have had enough of bars.”

“I only stayed a minute. I take one drink every afternoon, and no more.”

“Don't you want a cocktail before dinner?” Lincoln asked.

“I take only one drink every afternoon, and I've had that.”

“I hope you keep to it,” said Marion.

Her dislike was evident in the coldness with which she spoke, but Charlie only smiled; he had larger plans. Her very aggressiveness gave him an advantage, and he knew enough to wait. He wanted them to initiate the discussion of what they knew had brought him to Paris.

At dinner he couldn't decide whether Honoria was most like him or her mother. Fortunate if she didn't combine the traits of both that had brought them to disaster. A great wave of protectiveness went over him. He thought he knew what to do for her. He believed in character; he wanted to jump back a whole generation and trust in character again as the eternally valuable element. Everything wore out.

He left soon after dinner, but not to go home. He was curious to see Paris by night with clearer and more judicious eyes than those of other days. He bought a strapontin for the Casino and watched Josephine Baker go through her chocolate arabesques.

After an hour he left and strolled toward Montmartre, up the Rue Pigalle into the Place Blanche. The rain had stopped and there were a few people in evening clothes disembarking from taxis in front of cabarets, and cocottes prowling singly or in pairs, and many Negroes. He passed a lighted door from which issued music, and stopped with the sense of familiarity; it was Bricktop's, where he had parted with so many hours and so much money. A few doors farther on he found another ancient rendezvous and incautiously put his head inside. Immediately an eager orchestra burst into sound, a pair of professional dancers leaped to their feet and a maître d‘hôtel swooped toward him, crying, “Crowd just arriving, sir!” But he withdrew quickly.

“You have to be damn drunk,” he thought.

Zelli's was closed, the bleak and sinister cheap hotels surrounding it were dark; up in the Rue Blanche there was more light and a local, colloquial French crowd. The Poet's Cave had disappeared, but the two great mouths of the Café of Heaven and the Café of Hell still yawned—even devoured, as he watched, the meager contents of a tourist bus—a German, a Japanese, and an American couple who glanced at him with frightened eyes.

So much for the effort and ingenuity of Montmartre. All the catering to vice and waste was on an utterly childish scale, and he suddenly realized the meaning of the word“dissipate”—to dissipate into thin air; to make nothing out of something. In the little hours of the night every move from place to place was an enormous human jump, an increase of paying for the privilege of slower and slower motion.

He remembered thousand-franc notes given to an orchestra for playing a single number, hundred-franc notes tossed to a doorman for calling a cab.

But it hadn't been given for nothing.

It had been given, even the most wildly squandered sum, as an offering to destiny that he might not remember the things most worth remembering, the things that now he would always remember—his child taken from his control, his wife escaped to a grave in Vermont.

In the glare of a brasserie a woman spoke to him. He bought her some eggs and coffee, and then, eluding her encouraging stare, gave her a twenty-franc note and took a taxi to his hotel.





II


He woke upon a fine fall day—football weather. The depression of yesterday was gone and he liked the people on the streets. At noon he sat opposite Honoria at Le Grand Vatel, the only restaurant he could think of not reminiscent of champagne dinners and long luncheons that began at two and ended in a blurred and vague twilight.

“Now, how about vegetables? Oughtn't you to have some vegetables?”

“Well, yes.”

“Here's pinards and chou-fleur and carrots and haricots.”

“I'd like chou-fleur.”

“Wouldn't you like to have two vegetables?”

“I usually only have one at lunch.”

The waiter was pretending to be inordinately fond of children. “Qu'elle est mignonne la petite! Elle parle exactement comme une Française.”

“How about dessert? Shall we wait and see?”

The waiter disappeared. Honoria looked at her father expectantly.

“What are we going to do?”

“First, we're going to that toy store in the Rue Saint-Honoré and buy you anything you like. And then we're going to the vaudeville at the Empire.”

She hesitated. “I like it about the vaudeville, but not the toy store.”

“Why not?”

“Well, you brought me this doll.” She had it with her. “And I've got lots of things. And we're not rich any more, are we?”

“We never were. But today you are to have anything you want.”

“All right,” she agreed resignedly.

When there had been her mother and a French nurse he had been inclined to be strict; now he extended himself, reached out for a new tolerance; he must be both parents to her and not shut any of her out of communication.

“I want to get to know you,” he said gravely. “First let me introduce myself. My name is Charles J. Wales, of Prague.”

“Oh, daddy!” her voice cracked with laughter.

“And who are you, please?” he persisted, and she accepted a role immediately: “Honoria Wales, Rue Palatine, Paris.”

“Married or single?”

“No, not married. Single.”

He indicated the doll. “But I see you have a child, madame.”

Unwilling to disinherit it, she took it to her heart and thought quickly: “Yes, I've been married, but I'm not married now. My husband is dead.”

He went on quickly, “And the child's name?”

“Simone. That's after my best friend at school.”

“I'm very pleased that you're doing so well at school.”

“I'm third this month,” she boasted. “Elsie”—that was her cousin—“is only about eighteenth, and Richard is about at the bottom.”

“You like Richard and Elsie, don't you?”

“Oh, yes. I like Richard quite well and I like her all right.”

Cautiously and casually he asked: “And Aunt Marion and Uncle Lincoln—which do you like best?”

“Oh, Uncle Lincoln, I guess.”

He was increasingly aware of her presence. As they came in, a murmur of“…adorable”followed them, and now the people at the next table bent all their silences upon her, staring as if she were something no more conscious than a flower.

“Why don't I live with you?” she asked suddenly. “Because mamma's dead?”

“You must stay here and learn more French. It would have been hard for daddy to take care of you so well.”

“I don't really need much taking care of any more. I do everything for myself.”

Going out of the restaurant, a man and a woman unexpectedly hailed him.

“Well, the old Wales!”

“Hello there, Lorraine.…Dunc.”

Sudden ghosts out of the past: Duncan Schaeffer, a friend from college. Lorraine Quarrles, a lovely, pale blonde of thirty; one of a crowd who had helped them make months into days in the lavish times of three years ago.

“My husband couldn't come this year,” she said, in answer to his question. “We're poor as hell. So he gave me two hundred a month and told me I could do my worst on that.…This your little girl?”

“What about coming back and sitting down?” Duncan asked.

“Can't do it.” He was glad for an excuse. As always, he felt Lorraine's passionate, provocative attraction, but his own rhythm was different now.

“Well, how about dinner?” she asked.

“I'm not free. Give me your address and let me call you.”

“Charlie, I believe you're sober,” she said judicially. “I honestly believe he's sober, Dunc. Pinch him and see if he's sober.”

Charlie indicated Honoria with his head. They both laughed.

“What's your address?” said Duncan sceptically.

He hesitated, unwilling to give the name of his hotel.

“I'm not settled yet. I'd better call you. We're going to see the vaudeville at the Empire.”

“There! That's what I want to do,” Lorraine said. “I want to see some clowns and acrobats and jugglers. That's just what we'll do, Dunc.”

“We've got to do an errand first,” said Charlie. “Perhaps we'll see you there.”

“All right, you snob.…Good-by, beautiful little girl.”

“Good-by.”

Honoria bobbed politely.

Somehow, an unwelcome encounter. They liked him because he was functioning, because he was serious; they wanted to see him, because he was stronger than they were now, because they wanted to draw a certain sustenance from his strength.

At the Empire, Honoria proudly refused to sit upon her father's folded coat. She was already an individual with a code of her own, and Charlie was more and more absorbed by the desire of putting a little of himself into her before she crystallized utterly. It was hopeless to try to know her in so short a time.

Between the acts they came upon Duncan and Lorraine in the lobby where the band was playing.

“Have a drink?”

“All right, but not up at the bar. We'll take a table.”

“The perfect father.”

Listening abstractedly to Lorraine, Charlie watched Honoria's eyes leave their table, and he followed them wistfully about the room, wondering what they saw. He met her glance and she smiled.

“I liked that lemonade,” she said.

What had she said? What had he expected? Going home in a taxi afterward, he pulled her over until her head rested against his chest.

“Darling, do you ever think about your mother?”

“Yes, sometimes,” she answered vaguely.

“I don't want you to forget her. Have you got a picture of her?”

“Yes, I think so. Anyhow, Aunt Marion has. Why don't you want me to forget her?”

“She loved you very much.”

“I loved her too.”

They were silent for a moment.

“Daddy, I want to come and live with you,” she said suddenly.

His heart leaped; he had wanted it to come like this.

“Aren't you perfectly happy?”

“Yes, but I love you better than anybody. And you love me better than anybody, don't you, now that mummy's dead?”

“Of course I do. But you won't always like me best, honey. You'll grow up and meet somebody your own age and go marry him and forget you ever had a daddy.”

“Yes, that's true,” she agreed tranquilly.

He didn't go in. He was coming back at nine o'clock and he wanted to keep himself fresh and new for the thing he must say then.

“When you're safe inside, just show yourself in that window.”

“All right. Good-by, dads, dads, dads, dads.”

He waited in the dark street until she appeared, all warm and glowing, in the window above and kissed her fingers out into the night.





III


They were waiting. Marion sat behind the coffee service in a dignified black dinner dress that just faintly suggested mourning. Lincoln was walking up and down with the animation of one who had already been talking. They were as anxious as he was to get into the question. He opened it almost immediately:

“I suppose you know what I want to see you about—why I really came to Paris.”

Marion played with the black stars on her necklace and frowned.

“I'm awfully anxious to have a home,” he continued. “And I'm awfully anxious to have Honoria in it. I appreciate your taking in Honoria for her mother's sake, but things have changed now”—he hesitated and then continued more forcibly—“changed radically with me, and I want to ask you to reconsider the matter. It would be silly for me to deny that about three years ago I was acting badly—”

Marion looked up at him with hard eyes.

“—but all that's over. As I told you, I haven't had more than a drink a day for over a year, and I take that drink deliberately, so that the idea of alcohol won't get too big in my imagination. You see the idea?”

“No,” said Marion succinctly.

“It's a sort of stunt I set myself. It keeps the matter in proportion.”

“I get you,” said Lincoln. “You don't want to admit it's got any attraction for you.”

“Something like that. Sometimes I forget and don't take it. But I try to take it. Anyhow, I couldn't afford to drink in my position. The people I represent are more than satisfied with what I've done, and I'm bringing my sister over from Burlington to keep house for me, and I want awfully to have Honoria too. You know that even when her mother and I weren't getting along well we never let anything that happened touch Honoria. I know she's fond of me and I know I'm able to take care of her and—well, there you are. How do you feel about it?”

He knew that now he would have to take a beating. It would last an hour or two hours, and it would be difficult, but if he modulated his inevitable resentment to the chastened attitude of the reformed sinner, he might win his point in the end.

Keep your temper, he told himself. You don't want to be justified. You want Honoria.

Lincoln spoke first: “We've been talking it over ever since we got your letter last month. We're happy to have Honoria here. She's a dear little thing, and we're glad to be able to help her, but of course that isn't the question—”

Marion interrupted suddenly. “How long are you going to stay sober, Charlie?” she asked.

“Permanently, I hope.”

“How can anybody count on that?”

“You know I never did drink heavily until I gave up business and came over here with nothing to do. Then Helen and I began to run around with—”

“Please leave Helen out of it. I can't bear to hear you talk about her like that.”

He stared at her grimly; he had never been certain how fond of each other the sisters were in life.

“My drinking only lasted about a year and a half—from the time we came over until I—collapsed.”

“It was time enough.”

“It was time enough,” he agreed.

“My duty is entirely to Helen,” she said. “I try to think what she would have wanted me to do. Frankly, from the night you did that terrible thing you haven't really existed for me. I can't help that. She was my sister.”

“Yes.”

“When she was dying she asked me to look out for Honoria. If you hadn't been in a sanitarium then, it might have helped matters.”

He had no answer.

“I'll never in my life be able to forget the morning when Helen knocked at my door, soaked to the skin and shivering, and said you'd locked her out.”

Charlie gripped the sides of the chair. This was more difficult than he expected; he wanted to launch out into a long expostulation and explanation, but he only said: “The night I locked her out—”and she interrupted, “I don't feel up to going over that again.”

After a moment's silence Lincoln said: “We're getting off the subject. You want Marion to set aside her legal guardianship and give you Honoria. I think the main point for her is whether she has confidence in you or not.”

“I don't blame Marion,” Charlie said slowly, “but I think she can have entire confidence in me. I had a good record up to three years ago. Of course, it's within human possibilities I might go wrong any time. But if we wait much longer I'll lose Honoria's childhood and my chance for a home.” He shook his head, “I'll simply lose her, don't you see?”

“Yes, I see,” said Lincoln.

“Why didn't you think of all this before?” Marion asked.

“I suppose I did, from time to time, but Helen and I were getting along badly. When I consented to the guardianship, I was flat on my back in a sanitarium and the market had cleaned me out. I knew I'd acted badly, and I thought if it would bring any peace to Helen, I'd agree to anything. But now it's different. I'm functioning, I'm behaving damn well, so far as—”

“Please don't swear at me,” Marion said.

He looked at her, startled. With each remark the force of her dislike became more and more apparent. She had built up all her fear of life into one wall and faced it toward him. This trivial reproof was possibly the result of some trouble with the cook several hours before. Charlie became increasingly alarmed at leaving Honoria in this atmosphere of hostility against himself; sooner or later it would come out, in a word here, a shake of the head there, and some of that distrust would be irrevocably implanted in Honoria. But he pulled his temper down out of his face and shut it up inside him; he had won a point, for Lincoln realized the absurdity of Marion's remark and asked her lightly since when she had objected to the word“damn.”

“Another thing,” Charlie said: “I'm able to give her certain advantages now. I'm going to take a French governess to Prague with me. I've got a lease on a new apartment—”

He stopped, realizing that he was blundering. They couldn't be expected to accept with equanimity the fact that his income was again twice as large as their own.

“I suppose you can give her more luxuries than we can,” said Marion. “When you were throwing away money we were living along watching every ten francs.…I suppose you'll start doing it again.”

“Oh, no,” he said. “I've learned. I worked hard for ten years, you know—until I got lucky in the market, like so many people. Terribly lucky. It didn't seem any use working any more, so I quit. It won't happen again.”

There was a long silence. All of them felt their nerves straining, and for the first time in a year Charlie wanted a drink. He was sure now that Lincoln Peters wanted him to have his child.

Marion shuddered suddenly; part of her saw that Charlie's feet were planted on the earth now, and her own maternal feeling recognized the naturalness of his desire; but she had lived for a long time with a prejudice—a prejudice founded on a curious disbelief in her sister's happiness, and which, in the shock of one terrible night, had turned to hatred for him. It had all happened at a point in her life where the discouragement of ill health and adverse circumstances made it necessary for her to believe in tangible villainy and a tangible villain.

“I can't help what I think!” she cried out suddenly. “How much you were responsible for Helen's death, I don't know. It's something you'll have to square with your own conscience.”

An electric current of agony surged through him; for a moment he was almost on his feet, an unuttered sound echoing in his throat. He hung on to himself for a moment, another moment.

“Hold on there,” said Lincoln uncomfortably. “I never thought you were responsible for that.”

“Helen died of heart trouble,” Charlie said dully.

“Yes, heart trouble.” Marion spoke as if the phrase had another meaning for her.

Then, in the flatness that followed her outburst, she saw him plainly and she knew he had somehow arrived at control over the situation. Glancing at her husband, she found no help from him, and as abruptly as if it were a matter of no importance, she threw up the sponge.

“Do what you like!” she cried, springing up from her chair. “She's your child. I'm not the person to stand in your way. I think if it were my child I'd rather see her—”She managed to check herself. “You two decide it. I can't stand this. I'm sick. I'm going to bed.”

She hurried from the room; after a moment Lincoln said:

“This has been a hard day for her. You know how strongly she feels—”His voice was almost apologetic: “When a woman gets an idea in her head.”

“Of course.”

“It's going to be all right. I think she sees now that you—can provide for the child, and so we can't very well stand in your way or Honoria's way.”

“Thank you, Lincoln.”

“I'd better go along and see how she is.”

“I'm going.”

He was still trembling when he reached the street, but a walk down the Rue Bonaparte to the quais set him up, and as he crossed the Seine, fresh and new by the quai lamps, he felt exultant. But back in his room he couldn't sleep. The image of Helen haunted him. Helen whom he had loved so until they had senselessly begun to abuse each other's love, tear it into shreds. On that terrible February night that Marion remembered so vividly, a slow quarrel had gone on for hours. There was a scene at the Florida, and then he attempted to take her home, and then she kissed young Webb at a table; after that there was what she had hysterically said. When he arrived home alone he turned the key in the lock in wild anger. How could he know she would arrive an hour later alone, that there would be a snowstorm in which she wandered about in slippers, too confused to find a taxi? Then the aftermath, her escaping pneumonia by a miracle, and all the attendant horror. They were“reconciled,” but that was the beginning of the end, and Marion, who had seen with her own eyes and who imagined it to be one of many scenes from her sister's martyrdom, never forgot.

Going over it again brought Helen nearer, and in the white, soft light that steals upon half sleep near morning he found himself talking to her again. She said that he was perfectly right about Honoria and that she wanted Honoria to be with him. She said she was glad he was being good and doing better. She said a lot of other things—very friendly things—but she was in a swing in a white dress, and swinging faster and faster all the time, so that at the end he could not hear clearly all that she said.





IV


He woke up feeling happy. The door of the world was open again. He made plans, vistas, futures for Honoria and himself, but suddenly he grew sad, remembering all the plans he and Helen had made. She had not planned to die. The present was the thing—work to do and someone to love. But not to love too much, for he knew the injury that a father can do to a daughter or a mother to a son by attaching them too closely: afterward, out in the world, the child would seek in the marriage partner the same blind tenderness and, failing probably to find it, turn against love and life.

It was another bright, crisp day. He called Lincoln Peters at the bank where he worked and asked if he could count on taking Honoria when he left for Prague. Lincoln agreed that there was no reason for delay. One thing—the legal guardianship. Marion wanted to retain that a while longer. She was upset by the whole matter, and it would oil things if she felt that the situation was still in her control for another year. Charlie agreed, wanting only the tangible, visible child.

Then the question of a governess. Charlie sat in a gloomy agency and talked to a cross Béarnaise and to a buxom Breton peasant, neither of whom he could have endured. There were others whom he would see tomorrow.

He lunched with Lincoln Peters at Griffons, trying to keep down his exultation.

“There's nothing quite like your own child,” Lincoln said. “But you understand how Marion feels too.”

“She's forgotten how hard I worked for seven years there,” Charlie said. “She just remembers one night.”

“There's another thing.” Lincoln hesitated. “While you and Helen were tearing around Europe throwing money away, we were just getting along. I didn't touch any of the prosperity because I never got ahead enough to carry anything but my insurance. I think Marion felt there was some kind of injustice in it—you not even working toward the end, and getting richer and richer.”

“It went just as quick as it came,” said Charlie.

“Yes, a lot of it stayed in the hands of chasseurs and saxophone players and maîtres d‘hôtel—well, the big party's over now. I just said that to explain Marion's feeling about those crazy years. If you drop in about six o'clock tonight before Marion's too tired, we'll settle the details on the spot.”

Back at his hotel, Charlie found a pneumatique that had been redirected from the Ritz bar where Charlie had left his address for the purpose of finding a certain man.

“DEAR CHARLIE:

You were so strange when we saw you the other day that I wondered if I did something to offend you. If so, I'm not conscious of it. In fact, I have thought about you too much for the last year, and it's always been in the back of my mind that I might see you if I came over here. We did have such good times that crazy spring, like the night you and I stole the butcher's tricycle, and the time we tried to call on the president and you had the old derby rim and the wire cane. Everybody seems so old lately, but I don't feel old a bit. Couldn't we get together some time today for old time's sake? I've got a vile hang-over for the moment, but will be feeling better this afternoon and will look for you about five in the sweat-shop at the Ritz.

Always Devotedly,

LORRAINE.”

His first feeling was one of awe that he had actually, in his mature years, stolen a tricycle and pedalled Lorraine all over the Étoile between the small hours and dawn. In retrospect it was a nightmare. Locking out Helen didn't fit in with any other act of his life, but the tricycle incident did—it was one of many. How many weeks or months of dissipation to arrive at that condition of utter irresponsibility?

He tried to picture how Lorraine had appeared to him then—very attractive; Helen was unhappy about it, though she said nothing. Yesterday, in the restaurant, Lorraine had seemed trite, blurred, worn away. He emphatically did not want to see her, and he was glad Alix had not given away his hotel address. It was a relief to think, instead, of Honoria, to think of Sundays spent with her and of saying good morning to her and of knowing she was there in his house at night, drawing her breath in the darkness.

At five he took a taxi and bought presents for all the Peters—a piquant cloth doll, a box of Roman soldiers, flowers for Marion, big linen handkerchiefs for Lincoln.

He saw, when he arrived in the apartment, that Marion had accepted the inevitable. She greeted him now as though he were a recalcitrant member of the family, rather than a menacing outsider. Honoria had been told she was going; Charlie was glad to see that her tact made her conceal her excessive happiness. Only on his lap did she whisper her delight and the question“When?” before she slipped away with the other children.

He and Marion were alone for a minute in the room, and on an impulse he spoke out boldly:

“Family quarrels are bitter things. They don't go according to any rules. They're not like aches or wounds; they're more like splits in the skin that won't heal because there's not enough material. I wish you and I could be on better terms.”

“Some things are hard to forget,” she answered. “It's a question of confidence.” There was no answer to this and presently she asked, “When do you propose to take her?”

“As soon as I can get a governess. I hoped the day after tomorrow.”

“That's impossible. I've got to get her things in shape. Not before Saturday.”

He yielded. Coming back into the room, Lincoln offered him a drink.

“I'll take my daily whisky,” he said.

It was warm here, it was a home, people together by a fire. The children felt very safe and important; the mother and father were serious, watchful. They had things to do for the children more important than his visit here. A spoonful of medicine was, after all, more important than the strained relations between Marion and himself. They were not dull people, but they were very much in the grip of life and circumstances. He wondered if he couldn't do something to get Lincoln out of his rut at the bank.

A long peal at the door-bell; the bonne tout faire passed through and went down the corridor. The door opened upon another long ring, and then voices, and the three in the salon looked up expectantly; Lincoln moved to bring the corridor within his range of vision, and Marion rose. Then the maid came back along the corridor, closely followed by the voices, which developed under the light into Duncan Schaeffer and Lorraine Quarrles.

They were gay, they were hilarious, they were roaring with laughter. For a moment Charlie was astounded; unable to understand how they ferreted out the Peters' address.

“Ah-h-h!” Duncan wagged his finger roguishly at Charlie. “Ah-h-h!”

They both slid down another cascade of laughter. Anxious and at a loss, Charlie shook hands with them quickly and presented them to Lincoln and Marion. Marion nodded, scarcely speaking. She had drawn back a step toward the fire; her little girl stood beside her, and Marion put an arm about her shoulder.

With growing annoyance at the intrusion, Charlie waited for them to explain themselves. After some concentration Duncan said:

“We came to invite you out to dinner. Lorraine and I insist that all this chi-chi, cagy business 'bout your address got to stop.”

Charlie came closer to them, as if to force them backward down the corridor.

“Sorry, but I can't. Tell me where you'll be and I'll phone you in half an hour.”

This made no impression. Lorraine sat down suddenly on the side of a chair, and focussing her eyes on Richard, cried, “Oh, what a nice little boy! Come here, little boy.” Richard glanced at his mother, but did not move. With a perceptible shrug of her shoulders, Lorraine turned back to Charlie:

“Come and dine. Sure your cousins won' mine. See you so sel'om. Or solemn.”

“I can't,” said Charlie sharply. “You two have dinner and I'll phone you.”

Her voice became suddenly unpleasant. “All right, we'll go. But I remember once when you hammered on my door at four A.M. I was enough of a good sport to give you a drink. Come on, Dunc.”

Still in slow motion, with blurred, angry faces, with uncertain feet, they retired along the corridor.

“Good night,” Charlie said.

“Good night!” responded Lorraine emphatically.

When he went back into the salon Marion had not moved, only now her son was standing in the circle of her other arm. Lincoln was still swinging Honoria back and forth like a pendulum from side to side.

“What an outrage!” Charlie broke out. “What an absolute outrage!” Neither of them answered. Charlie dropped into an armchair, picked up his drink, set it down again and said:

“People I haven't seen for two years having the colossal nerve—”

He broke off. Marion had made the sound“Oh!” in one swift, furious breath, turned her body from him with a jerk and left the room.

Lincoln set down Honoria carefully.

“You children go in and start your soup,” he said, and when they obeyed, he said to Charlie:

“Marion's not well and she can't stand shocks. That kind of people make her really physically sick.”

“I didn't tell them to come here. They wormed your name out of somebody. They deliberately—”

“Well, it's too bad. It doesn't help matters. Excuse me a minute.”

Left alone, Charlie sat tense in his chair. In the next room he could hear the children eating, talking in monosyllables, already oblivious to the scene between their elders. He heard a murmur of conversation from a farther room and then the ticking bell of a telephone receiver picked up, and in a panic he moved to the other side of the room and out of earshot.

In a minute Lincoln came back. “Look here, Charlie. I think we'd better call off dinner for tonight. Marion's in bad shape.”

“Is she angry with me?”

“Sort of,” he said, almost roughly. “She's not strong and—”

“You mean she's changed her mind about Honoria?”

“She's pretty bitter right now. I don't know. You phone me at the bank tomorrow.”

“I wish you'd explain to her I never dreamed these people would come here. I'm just as sore as you are.”

“I couldn't explain anything to her now.”

Charlie got up. He took his coat and hat and started down the corridor. Then he opened the door of the dining room and said in a strange voice, “Good night, children.”

Honoria rose and ran around the table to hug him.

“Good night, sweetheart,” he said vaguely, and then trying to make his voice more tender, trying to conciliate something, “Good night, dear children.”





V


Charlie went directly to the Ritz bar with the furious idea of finding Lorraine and Duncan, but they were not there, and he realized that in any case there was nothing he could do. He had not touched his drink at the Peters', and now he ordered a whisky-and-soda. Paul came over to say hello.

“It's a great change,” he said sadly. “We do about half the business we did. So many fellows I hear about back in the States lost everything, maybe not in the first crash, but then in the second. Your friend George Hardt lost every cent, I hear. Are you back in the States?”

“No, I'm in business in Prague.”

“I heard that you lost a lot in the crash.”

“I did,” and he added grimly, “but I lost everything I wanted in the boom.”

“Selling short.”

“Something like that.”

Again the memory of those days swept over him like a nightmare—the people they had met traveling; then people who couldn't add a row of figures or speak a coherent sentence. The little man Helen had consented to dance with at the ship's party, who had insulted her ten feet from the table; the women and girls carried screaming with drink or drugs out of public places—

—The men who locked their wives out in the snow, because the snow of twenty-nine wasn't real snow. If you didn't want it to be snow, you just paid some money.

He went to the phone and called the Peters' apartment; Lincoln answered.

“I called up because this thing is on my mind. Has Marion said anything definite?”

“Marion's sick,” Lincoln answered shortly. “I know this thing isn't altogether your fault, but I can't have her go to pieces about it. I'm afraid we'll have to let it slide for six months; I can't take the chance of working her up to this state again.”

“I see.”

“I'm sorry, Charlie.”

He went back to his table. His whisky glass was empty, but he shook his head when Alix looked at it questioningly. There wasn't much he could do now except send Honoria some things; he would send her a lot of things tomorrow. He thought rather angrily that this was just money—he had given so many people money.…

“No, no more,” he said to another waiter. “What do I owe you?”

He would come back some day; they couldn't make him pay forever. But he wanted his child, and nothing was much good now, beside that fact. He wasn't young any more, with a lot of nice thoughts and dreams to have by himself. He was absolutely sure Helen wouldn't have wanted him to be so alone.





CRAZY SUNDAY


I


It was Sunday—not a day, but rather a gap between two other days. Behind, for all of them, lay sets and sequences, the long waits under the crane that swung the microphone, the hundred miles a day by automobiles to and fro across a county, the struggles of rival ingenuities in the conference rooms, the ceaseless compromise, the clash and strain of many personalities fighting for their lives. And now Sunday, with individual life starting up again, with a glow kindling in eyes that had been glazed with monotony the afternoon before. Slowly as the hours waned they came awake like“Puppenfeen”in a toy shop: an intense colloquy in a corner, lovers disappearing to neck in a hall. And the feeling of“Hurry, it's not too late, but for God's sake hurry before the blessed forty hours of leisure are over.”

Joel Coles was writing continuity. He was twenty-eight and not yet broken by Hollywood. He had had what were considered nice assignments since his arrival six months before and he submitted his scenes and sequences with enthusiasm. He referred to himself modestly as a hack but really did not think of it that way. His mother had been a successful actress; Joel had spent his childhood between London and New York trying to separate the real from the unreal, or at least to keep one guess ahead. He was a handsome man with the pleasant cow-brown eyes that in 1913 had gazed out at Broadway audiences from his mother's face.

When the invitation came it made him sure that he was getting somewhere. Ordinarily he did not go out on Sundays but stayed sober and took work home with him. Recently they had given him a Eugene O'Neill play destined for a very important lady indeed. Everything he had done so far had pleased Miles Calman, and Miles Calman was the only director on the lot who did not work under a supervisor and was responsible to the money men alone. Everything was clicking into place in Joel's career. (“This is Mr. Calman's secretary. Will you come to tea from four to six Sunday—he lives in Beverly Hills, number—.”)

Joel was flattered. It would be a party out of the top-drawer. It was a tribute to himself as a young man of promise. The Marion Davies' crowd, the high-hats, the big currency numbers, perhaps even Dietrich and Garbo and the Marquise, people who were not seen everywhere, would probably be at Calman's.

“I won't take anything to drink,” he assured himself. Calman was audibly tired of rummies, and thought it was a pity the industry could not get along without them.

Joel agreed that writers drank too much—he did himself, but he wouldn't this afternoon. He wished Miles would be within hearing when the cocktails were passed to hear his succinct, unobtrusive, “No, thank you.”

Miles Calman's house was built for great emotional moments—there was an air of listening, as if the far silences of its vistas hid an audience, but this afternoon it was thronged, as though people had been bidden rather than asked. Joel noted with pride that only two other writers from the studio were in the crowd, an ennobled limey and, somewhat to his surprise, Nat Keogh, who had evoked Calman's impatient comment on drunks.

Stella Calman (Stella Walker, of course) did not move on to her other guests after she spoke to Joel. She lingered—she looked at him with the sort of beautiful look that demands some sort of acknowledgment and Joe drew quickly on the dramatic adequacy inherited from his mother:

“Well, you look about sixteen! Where's your kiddy car?”

She was visibly pleased; she lingered. He felt that he should say something more, something confident and easy—he had first met her when she was struggling for bits in New York. At the moment a tray slid up and Stella put a cocktail glass into his hand.

“Everybody's afraid, aren't they?” he said, looking at it absently. “Everybody watches for everybody else's blunders, or tries to make sure they're with people that'll do them credit. Of course that's not true in your house,” he covered himself hastily. “I just meant generally in Hollywood.”

Stella agreed. She presented several people to Joel as if he were very important. Reassuring himself that Miles was at the other side of the room, Joel drank the cocktail.

“So you have a baby?” he said. “That's the time to look out. After a pretty woman has had her first child, she's very vulnerable, because she wants to be reassured about her own charm. She's got to have some new man's unqualified devotion to prove to herself she hasn't lost anything.”

“I never get anybody's unqualified devotion,” Stella said rather resentfully.

“They're afraid of your husband.”

“You think that's it?” She wrinkled her brow over the idea; then the conversation was interrupted at the exact moment Joel would have chosen.

Her attentions had given him confidence. Not for him to join safe groups, to slink to refuge under the wings of such acquaintances as he saw about the room. He walked to the window and looked out toward the Pacific, colorless under its sluggish sunset. It was good here—the American Riviera and all that, if there were ever time to enjoy it. The handsome, well-dressed people in the room, the lovely girls, and the—well, the lovely girls. You couldn't have everything.

He saw Stella's fresh boyish face, with the tired eyelid that always drooped a little over one eye, moving about among her guests and he wanted to sit with her and talk a long time as if she were a girl instead of a name; he followed her to see if she paid anyone as much attention as she had paid him. He took another cocktail—not because he needed confidence but because she had given him so much of it. Then he sat down beside the director's mother.

“Your son's gotten to be a legend, Mrs. Calman—Oracle and a Man of Destiny and all that. Personally, I'm against him but I'm in a minority. What do you think of him? Are you impressed? Are you surprised how far he's gone?”

“No, I'm not surprised,” she said calmly. “We always expected a lot from Miles.”

“Well now, that's unusual,” remarked Joel. “I always think all mothers are like Napoleon's mother. My mother didn't want me to have anything to do with the entertainment business. She wanted me to go to West Point and be safe.”

“We always had every confidence in Miles.” …

He stood by the built-in bar of the dining room with the good-humored, heavy-drinking, highly paid Nat Keogh.

“—I made a hundred grand during the year and lost forty grand gambling, so now I've hired a manager.”

“You mean an agent,” suggested Joel.

“No, I've got that too. I mean a manager. I make over everything to my wife and then he and my wife get together and hand me out the money. I pay him five thousand a year to hand me out my money.”

“You mean your agent.”

“No, I mean my manager, and I'm not the only one—a lot of other irresponsible people have him.”

“Well, if you're irresponsible why are you responsible enough to hire a manager?”

“I'm just irresponsible about gambling. Look here—”

A singer performed; Joel and Nat went forward with the others to listen.





II


The singing reached Joel vaguely; he felt happy and friendly toward all the people gathered there, people of bravery and industry, superior to a bourgeoisie that outdid them in ignorance and loose living, risen to a position of the highest prominence in a nation that for a decade had wanted only to be entertained. He liked them—he loved them. Great waves of good feeling flowed through him.

As the singer finished his number and there was a drift toward the hostess to say good-by, Joel had an idea. He would give them“Building It Up,” his own composition. It was his only parlor trick, it had amused several parties and it might please Stella Walker. Possessed by the hunch, his blood throbbing with the scarlet corpuscles of exhibitionism, he sought her.

“Of course,” she cried. “Please! Do you need anything?”

“Someone has to be the secretary that I'm supposed to be dictating to.”

“I'll be her.”

As the word spread the guests in the hall, already putting on their coats to leave, drifted back and Joel faced the eyes of many strangers. He had a dim foreboding, realizing that the man who had just performed was a famous radio entertainer. Then someone said“Sh!” and he was alone with Stella, the center of a sinister Indian-like half-circle. Stella smiled up at him expectantly—he began.

His burlesque was based upon the cultural limitations of Mr. Dave Silverstein, an independent producer; Silverstein was presumed to be dictating a letter outlining a treatment of a story he had bought.

“—a story of divorce, the younger generators and the Foreign Legion,” he heard his voice saying, with the intonations of Mr. Silverstein. “But we got to build it up, see?”

A sharp pang of doubt struck through him. The faces surrounding him in the gently molded light were intent and curious, but there was no ghost of a smile anywhere; directly in front the Great Lover of the screen glared at him with an eye as keen as the eye of a potato. Only Stella Walker looked up at him with a radiant, never faltering smile.

“If we make him a Menjou type, then we get a sort of Michael Arlen only with a Honolulu atmosphere.”

Still not a ripple in front, but in the rear a rustling, a perceptible shift toward the left, toward the front door.

“—then she says she feels this sex appil for him and he burns out and says ‘Oh go on destroy yourself—’”

At some point he heard Nat Keogh snicker and here and there were a few encouraging faces, but as he finished he had the sickening realization that he had made a fool of himself in view of an important section of the picture world, upon whose favor depended his career.

For a moment he existed in the midst of a confused silence, broken by a general trek for the door. He felt the undercurrent of derision that rolled through the gossip; then—all this was in the space of ten seconds—the Great Lover, his eye hard and empty as the eye of a needle, shouted“Boo! Boo!” voicing in an overtone what he felt was the mood of the crowd. It was the resentment of the professional toward the amateur, of the community toward the stranger, the thumbs-down of the clan.

Only Stella Walker was still standing near and thanking him as if he had been an unparalleled success, as if it hadn't occurred to her that anyone hadn't liked it. As Nat Keogh helped him into his overcoat, a great wave of self-disgust swept over him and he clung desperately to his rule of never betraying an inferior emotion until he no longer felt it.

“I was a flop,” he said lightly, to Stella. “Never mind, it's a good number when appreciated. Thanks for your coöperation.”

The smile did not leave her face—he bowed rather drunkenly and Nat drew him toward the door.…

The arrival of his breakfast awakened him into a broken and ruined world. Yesterday he was himself, a point of fire against an industry, today he felt that he was pitted under an enormous disadvantage, against those faces, against individual contempt and collective sneer. Worse than that, to Miles Calman he was become one of those rummies, stripped of dignity, whom Calman regretted he was compelled to use. To Stella Walker, on whom he had forced a martyrdom to preserve the courtesy of her house—her opinion he did not dare to guess. His gastric juices ceased to flow and he set his poached eggs back on the telephone table. He wrote:

“Dear Miles:

You can imagine my profound self-disgust. I confess to a taint of exhibitionism, but at six o'clock in the afternoon, in broad daylight! Good God! My apologies to your wife.

Yours Ever,

Joel Coles.”

Joel emerged from his office on the lot only to slink like a malefactor to the tobacco store. So suspicious was his manner that one of the studio police asked to see his admission card. He had decided to eat lunch outside when Nat Keogh, confident and cheerful, overtook him.

“What do you mean you're in permanent retirement? What if that Three-Piece Suit did boo you?”

“Why, listen,” he continued, drawing Joel into the studio restaurant. “The night of one of his premiers at Grauman's, Joe Squires kicked his tail while he was bowing to the crowd. The ham said Joe'd hear from him later but when Joe called him up at eight o'clock next day and said, ‘I thought I was going to hear from you,’ he hung up the phone.”

The preposterous story cheered Joel, and he found a gloomy consolation in staring at the group at the next table, the sad, lovely Siamese twins, the mean dwarfs, the proud giant from the circus picture. But looking beyond at the yellow-stained faces of pretty women, their eyes all melancholy and startling with mascara, their ball gowns garish in full day, he saw a group who had been at Calman's and winced.

“Never again,” he exclaimed aloud, “absolutely my last social appearance in Hollywood!”

The following morning a telegram was waiting for him at his office:

“You were one of the most agreeable people at our party. Expect you at my sister June's buffet supper next Sunday.

STELLA WALKER CALMAN.”

The blood rushed fast through his veins for a feverish minute. Incredulously he read the telegram over.

“Well, that's the sweetest thing I ever heard of in my life!”





III


Crazy Sunday again. Joel slept until eleven, then he read a newspaper to catch up with the past week. He lunched in his room on trout, avocado salad and a pint of California wine. Dressing for the tea, he selected a pin-check suit, a blue shirt, a burnt orange tie. There were dark circles of fatigue under his eyes. In his second-hand car he drove to the Riviera apartments. As he was introducing himself to Stella's sister, Miles and Stella arrived in riding clothes—they had been quarreling fiercely most of the afternoon on all the dirt roads back of Beverly Hills.

Miles Calman, tall, nervous, with a desperate humor and the unhappiest eyes Joel ever saw, was an artist from the top of his curiously shaped head to his niggerish feet. Upon these last he stood firmly—he had never made a cheap picture though he had sometimes paid heavily for the luxury of making experimental flops. In spite of his excellent company, one could not be with him long without realizing that he was not a well man.

From the moment of their entrance Joel's day bound itself up inextricably with theirs. As he joined the group around them Stella turned away from it with an impatient little tongue click—and Miles Calman said to the man who happened to be next to him:

“Go easy on Eva Goebel. There's hell to pay about her at home.” Miles turned to Joel, “I'm sorry I missed you at the office yesterday. I spent the afternoon at the analyst's.”

“You being psychoanalyzed?”

“I have been for months. First I went for claustrophobia, now I'm trying to get my whole life cleared up. They say it'll take over a year.”

“There's nothing the matter with your life,” Joel assured him.

“Oh, no? Well, Stella seems to think so. Ask anybody—they can all tell you about it,” he said bitterly.

A girl perched herself on the arm of Miles' chair; Joel crossed to Stella, who stood disconsolately by the fire.

“Thank you for your telegram,” he said. “It was darn sweet. I can't imagine anybody as good-looking as you are being so good-humored.”

She was a little lovelier than he had ever seen her and perhaps the unstinted admiration in his eyes prompted her to unload on him—it did not take long, for she was obviously at the emotional bursting point.

“—and Miles has been carrying on this thing for two years, and I never knew. Why, she was one of my best friends, always in the house. Finally when people began to come to me, Miles had to admit it.”

She sat down vehemently on the arm of Joel's chair. Her riding breeches were the color of the chair and Joel saw that the mass of her hair was made up of some strands of red gold and some of pale gold, so that it could not be dyed, and that she had on no make-up. She was that good-looking—

Still quivering with the shock of her discovery, Stella found unbearable the spectacle of a new girl hovering over Miles; she led Joel into a bedroom, and seated at either end of a big bed they went on talking. People on their way to the washroom glanced in and made wisecracks, but Stella, emptying out her story, paid no attention. After a while Miles stuck his head in the door and said, “There's no use trying to explain something to Joel in half an hour that I don't understand myself and the psychoanalyst says will take a whole year to understand.”

She talked on as if Miles were not there. She loved Miles, she said—under considerable difficulties she had always been faithful to him.

“The psychoanalyst told Miles that he had a mother complex. In his first marriage he transferred his mother complex to his wife, you see—and then his sex turned to me. But when we married the thing repeated itself—he transferred his mother complex to me and all his libido turned toward this other woman.”

Joel knew that this probably wasn't gibberish—yet it sounded like gibberish. He knew Eva Goebel; she was a motherly person, older and probably wiser than Stella, who was a golden child.

Miles now suggested impatiently that Joel come back with them since Stella had so much to say, so they drove out to the mansion in Beverly Hills. Under the high ceilings the situation seemed more dignified and tragic. It was an eerie bright night with the dark very clear outside of all the windows and Stella all rose-gold raging and crying around the room. Joel did not quite believe in picture actresses' grief. They have other preoccupations—they are beautiful rose-gold figures blown full of life by writers and directors, and after hours they sit around and talk in whispers and giggle innuendoes, and the ends of many adventures flow through them.

Sometimes he pretended to listen and instead thought how well she was got up—sleek breeches with a matched set of legs in them, an Italian-colored sweater with a little high neck, and a short brown chamois coat. He couldn't decide whether she was an imitation of an English lady or an English lady was an imitation of her. She hovered somewhere between the realest of realities and the most blatant of impersonations.

“Miles is so jealous of me that he questions everything I do,” she cried scornfully. “When I was in New York I wrote him that I'd been to the theater with Eddie Baker. Miles was so jealous he phoned me ten times in one day.”

“I was wild,” Miles snuffled sharply, a habit he had in times of stress. “The analyst couldn't get any results for a week.”

Stella shook her head despairingly. “Did you expect me just to sit in the hotel for three weeks?”

“I don't expect anything. I admit that I'm jealous. I try not to be. I worked on that with Dr. Bridgebane, but it didn't do any good. I was jealous of Joel this afternoon when you sat on the arm of his chair.”

“You were?” She started up. “You were! Wasn't there somebody on the arm of your chair? And did you speak to me for two hours?”

“You were telling your troubles to Joel in the bedroom.”

“When I think that that woman”—she seemed to believe that to omit Eva Goebel's name would be to lessen her reality—“used to come here—”

“All right—all right,” said Miles wearily. “I've admitted everything and I feel as bad about it as you do.” Turning to Joel he began talking about pictures, while Stella moved restlessly along the far walls, her hands in her breeches pockets.

“They've treated Miles terribly,” she said, coming suddenly back into the conversation as if they'd never discussed her personal affairs. “Dear, tell him about old Beltzer trying to change your picture.”

As she stood hovering protectively over Miles, her eyes flashing with indignation in his behalf, Joel realized that he was in love with her. Stifled with excitement he got up to say good night.

With Monday the week resumed its workaday rhythm, in sharp contrast to the theoretical discussions, the gossip and scandal of Sunday; there was the endless detail of script revision—“Instead of a lousy dissolve, we can leave her voice on the sound track and cut to a medium shot of the taxi from Bell's angle or we can simply pull the camera back to include the station, hold it a minute and then pan to the row of taxis”—by Monday afternoon Joel had again forgotten that people whose business was to provide entertainment were ever privileged to be entertained. In the evening he phoned Miles' house. He asked for Miles but Stella came to the phone.

“Do things seem better?”

“Not particularly. What are you doing next Saturday evening?”

“Nothing.”

“The Perrys are giving a dinner and theater party and Miles won't be here—he's flying to South Bend to see the Notre Dame-California game. I thought you might go with me in his place.”

After a long moment Joel said, “Why—surely. If there's a conference I can't make dinner but I can get to the theater.”

“Then I'll say we can come.”

Joel walked his office. In view of the strained relations of the Calmans, would Miles be pleased, or did she intend that Miles shouldn't know of it? That would be out of the question—if Miles didn't mention it Joel would. But it was an hour or more before he could get down to work again.

Wednesday there was a four-hour wrangle in a conference room crowded with planets and nebulae of cigarette smoke. Three men and a woman paced the carpet in turn, suggesting or condemning, speaking sharply or persuasively, confidently or despairingly. At the end Joel lingered to talk to Miles.

The man was tired—not with the exaltation of fatigue but life-tired, with his lids sagging and his beard prominent over the blue shadows near his mouth.

“I hear you're flying to the Notre Dame game.”

Miles looked beyond him and shook his head.

“I've given up the idea.”

“Why?”

“On account of you.” Still he did not look at Joel.

“What the hell, Miles?”

“That's why I've given it up.” He broke into a perfunctory laugh at himself. “I can't tell what Stella might do just out of spite—she's invited you to take her to the Perrys', hasn't she? I wouldn't enjoy the game.”

The fine instinct that moved swiftly and confidently on the set, muddled so weakly and helplessly through his personal life.

“Look, Miles,” Joel said frowning. “I've never made any passes whatsoever at Stella. If you're really seriously cancelling your trip on account of me, I won't go to the Perrys' with her. I won't see her. You can trust me absolutely.”

Miles looked at him, carefully now.

“Maybe.” He shrugged his shoulders. “Anyhow there'd just be somebody else. I wouldn't have any fun.”

“You don't seem to have much confidence in Stella. She told me she'd always been true to you.”

“Maybe she has.” In the last few minutes several more muscles had sagged around Miles' mouth. “But how can I ask anything of her after what's happened? How can I expect her—”He broke off and his face grew harder as he said, “I'll tell you one thing, right or wrong and no matter what I've done, if I ever had anything on her I'd divorce her. I can't have my pride hurt—that would be the last straw.”

His tone annoyed Joel, but he said:

“Hasn't she calmed down about the Eva Goebel thing?”

“No.” Miles snuffled pessimistically. “I can't get over it either.”

“I thought it was finished.”

“I'm trying not to see Eva again, but you know it isn't easy just to drop something like that—it isn't some girl I kissed last night in a taxi! The psychoanalyst says—”

“I know,” Joel interrupted. “Stella told me.” This was depressing. “Well, as far as I'm concerned if you go to the game I won't see Stella. And I'm sure Stella has nothing on her conscience about anybody.”

“Maybe not,” Miles repeated listlessly. “Anyhow I'll stay and take her to the party. Say,” he said suddenly, “I wish you'd come too. I've got to have somebody sympathetic to talk to. That's the trouble—I've influenced Stella in everything. Especially I've influenced her so that she likes all the men I like—it's very difficult.”

“It must be,” Joel agreed.

Joel could not get to the dinner. Self-conscious in his silk hat against the unemployment, he waited for the others in front of the Hollywood Theatre and watched the evening parade: obscure replicas of bright, particular picture stars, spavined men in polo coats, a stomping dervish with the beard and staff of an apostle, a pair of chic Filipinos in collegiate clothes, reminder that this corner of the Republic opened to the seven seas, a long fantastic carnival of young shouts which proved to be a fraternity initiation. The line split to pass two smart limousines that stopped at the curb.

There she was, in a dress like ice-water, made in a thousand pale-blue pieces, with icicles trickling at the throat. He started forward.

“So you like my dress?”

“Where's Miles?”

“He flew to the game after all. He left yesterday morning—at least I think—”She broke off. “I just got a telegram from South Bend saying that he's starting back. I forgot—you know all these people?”

The party of eight moved into the theater.

Miles had gone after all and Joel wondered if he should have come. But during the performance, with Stella a profile under the pure grain of light hair, he thought no more about Miles. Once he turned and looked at her and she looked back at him, smiling and meeting his eyes for as long as he wanted. Between the acts they smoked in the lobby and she whispered:

“They're all going to the opening of Jack Johnson's night club—I don't want to go, do you?”

“Do we have to?”

“I suppose not.” She hesitated. “I'd like to talk to you. I suppose we could go to our house—if I were only sure—”

Again she hesitated and Joel asked:

“Sure of what?”

“Sure that—oh, I'm haywire I know, but how can I be sure Miles went to the game?”

“You mean you think he's with Eva Goebel?”

“No, not so much that—but supposing he was here watching everything I do. You know Miles does odd things sometimes. Once he wanted a man with a long beard to drink tea with him and he sent down to the casting agency for one, and drank tea with him all afternoon.”

“That's different. He sent you a wire from South Bend—that proves he's at the game.”

After the play they said good night to the others at the curb and were answered by looks of amusement. They slid off along the golden garish thoroughfare through the crowd that had gathered around Stella.

“You see he could arrange the telegrams,” Stella said, “very easily.”

That was true. And with the idea that perhaps her uneasiness was justified, Joel grew angry: if Miles had trained a camera on them he felt no obligations toward Miles. Aloud he said:

“That's nonsense.”

There were Christmas trees already in the shop windows and the full moon over the boulevard was only a prop, as scenic as the giant boudoir lamps of the corners. On into the dark foliage of Beverly Hills that flamed as eucalyptus by day, Joel saw only the flash of a white face under his own, the arc of her shoulder. She pulled away suddenly and looked up at him.

“Your eyes are like your mother's,” she said. “I used to have a scrap book full of pictures of her.”

“Your eyes are like your own and not a bit like any other eyes,” he answered.

Something made Joel look out into the grounds as they went into the house, as if Miles were lurking in the shrubbery. A telegram waited on the hall table. She read aloud:

“Chicago.

Home tomorrow night.Thinking of you.Love.

Miles.”

“You see,” she said, throwing the slip back on the table, “he could easily have faked that.” She asked the butler for drinks and sandwiches and ran upstairs, while Joel walked into the empty reception rooms. Strolling about he wandered to the piano where he had stood in disgrace two Sundays before.

“Then we could put over,” he said aloud, “a story of divorce, the younger generators and the Foreign Legion.”

His thoughts jumped to another telegram.

“You were one of the most agreeable people at our party—”

An idea occurred to him. If Stella's telegram had been purely a gesture of courtesy then it was likely that Miles had inspired it, for it was Miles who had invited him. Probably Miles had said:

“Send him a wire—he's miserable—he thinks he's queered himself.”

It fitted in with“I've influenced Stella in everything. Especially I've influenced her so that she likes all the men I like.” A woman would do a thing like that because she felt sympathetic—only a man would do it because he felt responsible.

When Stella came back into the room he took both her hands.

“I have a strange feeling that I'm a sort of pawn in a spite game you're playing against Miles,” he said.

“Help yourself to a drink.”

“And the odd thing is that I'm in love with you anyhow.”

The telephone rang and she freed herself to answer it.

“Another wire from Miles,” she announced. “He dropped it, or it says he dropped it, from the airplane at Kansas City.”

“I suppose he asked to be remembered to me.”

“No, he just said he loved me. I believe he does. He's so very weak.”

“Come sit beside me,” Joel urged her.

It was early. And it was still a few minutes short of midnight a half-hour later, when Joel walked to the cold hearth, and said tersely:

“Meaning that you haven't any curiosity about me?”

“Not at all. You attract me a lot and you know it. The point is that I suppose I really do love Miles.”

“Obviously.”

“And tonight I feel uneasy about everything.”

He wasn't angry—he was even faintly relieved that a possible entanglement was avoided. Still as he looked at her, the warmth and softness of her body thawing her cold blue costume, he knew she was one of the things he would always regret.

“I've got to go,” he said. “I'll phone a taxi.”

“Nonsense—there's a chauffeur on duty.”

He winced at her readiness to have him go, and seeing this she kissed him lightly and said, “You're sweet, Joel.” Then suddenly three things happened: he took down his drink at a gulp, the phone rang loud through the house and a clock in the hall struck in trumpet notes.

Nine—ten—eleven—twelve—

It was Sunday again. Joel realized that he had come to the theater this evening with the work of the week still hanging about him like cerements. He had made love to Stella as he might attack some matter to be cleaned up hurriedly before the day's end. But this was Sunday—the lovely, lazy perspective of the next twenty-four hours unrolled before him—every minute was something to be approached with lulling indirection, every moment held the germ of innumerable possibilities. Nothing was impossible—everything was just beginning. He poured himself another drink.

With a sharp moan, Stella slipped forward inertly by the telephone. Joel picked her up and laid her on the sofa. He squirted soda-water on a handkerchief and slapped it over her face. The telephone mouthpiece was still grinding and he put it to his ear.

“—the plane fell just this side of Kansas City. The body of Miles Calman has been identified and—”

He hung up the receiver.

“Lie still,” he said, stalling, as Stella opened her eyes.

“Oh, what's happened?” she whispered. “Call them back. Oh, what's happened?”

“I'll call them right away. What's your doctor's name?”

“Did they say Miles was dead?”

“Lie quiet—is there a servant still up?”

“Hold me—I'm frightened.”

He put his arm around her.

“I want the name of your doctor,” he said sternly. “It may be a mistake but I want someone here.”

“It's Doctor—Oh, God, is Miles dead?”

Joel ran upstairs and searched through strange medicine cabinets for spirits of ammonia. When he came down Stella cried:

“He isn't dead—I know he isn't. This is part of his scheme. He's torturing me. I know he's alive. I can feel he's alive.”

“I want to get hold of some close friend of yours, Stella. You can't stay here alone tonight.”

“Oh, no,” she cried. “I can't see anybody. You stay. I haven't got any friend.” She got up, tears streaming down her face. “Oh, Miles is my only friend. He's not dead—he can't be dead. I'm going there right away and see. Get a train. You'll have to come with me.”

“You can't. There's nothing to do tonight. I want you to tell me the name of some woman I can call: Lois? Joan? Carmel? Isn't there somebody?”

Stella stared at him blindly.

“Eva Goebel was my best friend,” she said.

Joel thought of Miles, his sad and desperate face in the office two days before. In the awful silence of his death all was clear about him. He was the only American-born director with both an interesting temperament and an artistic conscience. Meshed in an industry, he had paid with his ruined nerves for having no resilience, no healthy cynicism, no refuge—only a pitiful and precarious escape.

There was a sound at the outer door—it opened suddenly, and there were footsteps in the hall.

“Miles!” Stella screamed. “Is it you, Miles? Oh, it's Miles.”

A telegraph boy appeared in the doorway.

“I couldn't find the bell. I heard you talking inside.”

The telegram was a duplicate of the one that had been phoned. While Stella read it over and over, as though it were a black lie, Joel telephoned. It was still early and he had difficulty getting anyone; when finally he succeeded in finding some friends he made Stella take a stiff drink.

“You'll stay here, Joel,” she whispered, as though she were half-asleep. “You won't go away. Miles liked you—he said you—”She shivered violently, “Oh, my God, you don't know how alone I feel.” Her eyes closed, “Put your arms around me. Miles had a suit like that.” She started bolt upright. “Think of what he must have felt. He was afraid of almost everything, anyhow.”

She shook her head dazedly. Suddenly she seized Joel's face and held it close to hers.

“You won't go. You like me—you love me, don't you? Don't call up anybody. Tomorrow's time enough. You stay here with me tonight.”

He stared at her, at first incredulously, and then with shocked understanding. In her dark groping Stella was trying to keep Miles alive by sustaining a situation in which he had figured—as if Miles' mind could not die so long as the possibilities that had worried him still existed. It was a distraught and tortured effort to stave off the realization that he was dead.

Resolutely Joel went to the phone and called a doctor.

“Don't, oh, don't call anybody!” Stella cried. “Come back here and put your arms around me.”

“Is Doctor Bales in?”

“Joel,” Stella cried. “I thought I could count on you. Miles liked you. He was jealous of you—Joel, come here.”

Ah then—if he betrayed Miles she would be keeping him alive—for if he were really dead how could he be betrayed?

“—has just had a very severe shock. Can you come at once, and get hold of a nurse?”

“Joel!”

Now the door-bell and the telephone began to ring intermittently, and automobiles were stopping in front of the door.

“But you're not going,” Stella begged him. “You're going to stay, aren't you?”

“No,” he answered. “But I'll be back, if you need me.”

Standing on the steps of the house which now hummed and palpitated with the life that flutters around death like protective leaves, he began to sob a little in his throat.

“Everything he touched he did something magical to,” he thought. “He even brought that little gamin alive and made her a sort of masterpiece.”

And then:

“What a hell of a hole he leaves in this damn wilderness—already!”

And then with a certain bitterness, “Oh, yes, I'll be back—I'll be back!”
