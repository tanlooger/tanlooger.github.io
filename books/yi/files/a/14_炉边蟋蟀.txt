是水壶开的头！别跟我说皮瑞宾格尔太太说了些什么。我知道得更清楚。皮瑞宾格尔太太可能永远记录在案，说她不知道它们之间是谁开的头；然而，我说是水壶开的头。我想，我应该知道！照墙角上那只钟面光滑的小荷兰钟算来，水壶开始了足足有五分钟之后，蟋蟀才唱起来。

似乎在蟋蟀参加鸣唱以前，那只钟报时还没有报完，钟顶上那个跳动的制作干草的小人儿，在摩尔式宫殿[1]前，拿着镰刀，左一跳，右一跳，还没有割完半英亩假想的青草呢！

说真的，我并不是生来就这样自信。大家都知道这一点。除非十分肯定，我无论如何也不会让自己的意见跟皮瑞宾格尔太太的意见对立起来。什么也不能叫我这样做。不过，现在是一个事实问题。而事实是在蟋蟀还没有一点存在的影儿的时候，水壶至少已经开始了五分钟。你要是反驳我，那我就说十分钟。

让我精确地叙述事情是怎么发生的。我本来应该一开始就着手叙述，只不过又考虑到这个明显的道理——假如要说一个故事，必须从开头的地方开头；而不从水壶开头，又怎么可能从开头的地方开头呢？

你必须了解，水壶跟蟋蟀之间看来像是在进行一种竞赛或者竞技。事情就是这样引起来的，也就是这样发生的。

皮瑞宾格尔太太在阴寒的薄暮中走出屋子，木套鞋把湿漉漉的石头敲得咔嗒咔嗒响，整个院子都给印上无数拙劣的几何学上第一定理[2]的痕迹——皮瑞宾格尔太太在承接雨水的桶里把水壶灌满。她一回到屋里，去掉木套鞋（这一下可去掉不少，因为鞋跟高，皮瑞宾格尔太太却是个矮个儿），就把水壶放到炉火上。放上水壶，她不免恼火，或者说生了一会儿气；因为水冷得够呛，那溜滑的夹着雪的水似乎渗入了每一样东西，包括木套鞋的环扣——湿了皮瑞宾格尔太太的脚趾，甚至溅到了她的腿上。在我们相当自豪（也是相当合理）地夸耀自己的腿，一双长袜子保持得特别干净的时候，就会想到此时此景令人好不难受。

此外，水壶也不听使唤，叫人恼恨。它不肯让人在顶栅格上把它放正；它不肯跟煤块和睦相处；它偏要喝醉了似的向前倾着身子，淌着口水，真是炉边少有的蠢水壶。它对着炉火吵吵闹闹，唏唏嘘嘘，嘀嘀咕咕。到末了，壶盖反抗起皮瑞宾格尔太太的手指来，先是翻个筋斗，然后，以一种巧妙的执拗态度（它本应该有更好的态度）侧身潜水——一直沉到壶底。“皇家乔治号”[3]在船身出水的时候，没有做出过半点猛烈抗拒，可是这只水壶盖儿却这样跟皮瑞宾格尔太太斗了一场，才让她重新捞上来。

即使在这时候，水壶还要怫然色变，梗着脖子，把柄摆出敌对的架势，嘴巴放肆地、讥诮地对皮瑞宾格尔太太噘起来，好像在说：“我决不把水煮开了。说什么也不干！”

可是，皮瑞宾格尔太太已经恢复了好性子，她擦去胖嘟嘟的小手上的灰尘，笑着在水壶跟前坐下来。这当儿，欢快的火焰忽起忽落，闪闪烁烁地照着荷兰时钟顶上的制作干草的小人儿，使人以为他是呆然木立在摩尔式宫殿前，除了火焰以外，什么都静止不动。

然而他在动着，一秒钟跳动两次，正常而有规律。不过时钟快要敲打的时候，他那种受罪的样子瞧着可真叫人害怕。一只杜鹃鸟在宫殿的活门里探出头来，鸣叫六下，每一下都使他战栗一阵，像是听见鬼叫，或者像是有什么铁丝在扯着他的腿。

直到他下面的重锤和绳索发出的呼呼的噪声完全平息之后，这个吓坏了的制作干草者才恢复原状。他害怕也不是没有道理：因为这些嘎嘎作响、骨瘦如柴的轮条走得使人不安，我真弄不懂，怎么会有一帮人，尤其是怎么会有荷兰人，喜欢创造这种东西。一般认为荷兰人爱好大箱子，裤子穿得特别厚；当然，他们应该不至于把他们的时钟弄得那么干瘪精瘦，一无防护。

你看，这会儿，水壶开始消磨黄昏了。这会儿，水壶变得平和了，直想唱个什么，喉咙里忍不住咕噜起来，还不住地发出短促的喷鼻声，刚喷出来就咽回去，好像还没有完全拿定主意来跟人家和好。这会儿，在按捺住自己乐陶陶的情绪方面做了两三次徒劳无功的努力之后，它忽然抛开了一切不快，一切矜持，滔滔不绝地唱起歌来，唱得那么畅快，那么兴高采烈，连多愁善感的夜莺都从来没有想到这样唱过。

又那么清楚明白！天哪，你简直可以像看一本书一样了解它——或许比你跟我能够列举得出的一些书更高明。它的暖乎乎的热气喷作一片淡淡的烟云，愉悦而优雅地飘上几英尺，然后浮荡在壁炉周围，好像这是它自己的家庭里的天堂。水壶一面喷气，一面反复唱着歌，多快活，多有劲啊！它的铁制的身子也在炉火上哼着，动着哪；那只盖子，那只近来颇为叛逆的盖子——如此足为旌表的光辉榜样——在跳着一种急促轻快的舞，发出咔嗒咔嗒的响声，像是一个又聋又哑的年轻铙钹，它从来不知道它的孪生兄弟的用处。

这首水壶之歌是一首邀请和欢迎一个出门去的人的歌，是欢迎此刻正朝着这个安乐的小家庭和熊熊的炉火走来的人，这是毫无疑问的。皮瑞宾格尔太太坐在壁炉前沉思着，她完全明白这个。水壶唱道：“夜沉沉，道旁枯叶飘零零；天上只见雾蒙蒙，昏冥冥；地下一片泥坑坑，水淋淋；凄凉阴暗的空中只有一线光明；我不知道那是光明，因为它只不过闪晃一阵；像怒火一般红殷殷，犹如骄阳露面，狂风轰鸣；在乌云上打下烙印，因为这种天气确实可恨；最辽阔的原野也不过一长道森森的黑影；白霜覆盖着指路牌，融雪遮没了车辙痕；冰可不是水，水已经不能自由流动；有哪一样是它本来面目，你无法指明；然而他正在来临，来临，来临！——”

你瞧，到这里蟋蟀才加入鸣唱：啾啾，啾啾，啾啾；这样洪亮，就像合唱队一般。拿水壶作比较，这声音和它的身材太不相称了；（身材嘛，你看都看不见呢！）要是它此时此地像一支火药装得过多的枪那样炸开来，要是它当场牺牲，唱得小小身躯裂成五十片，看来也会像是十分自然的不可避免的结果，而它正在为这样的结果拼命。

水壶的独唱表演已经结束。它坚持下去，热情丝毫不减；可是蟋蟀担任并保持着领唱地位。天哪，你听它唱的！它那又尖又细又嘹亮的歌声在整个屋子里回响，并且在屋外的夜幕中似乎像星星一样闪光。唱到最高音域，它的歌声里出现一种难以描摹的微细的战栗和抖动，这表示它自己的激烈的热情使它站不稳，又不得不跳起来。然而蟋蟀和水壶合作得很好。歌尾叠句仍然那样唱；它们竞相唱着那句，越唱越响，越唱越响。

这位美丽的小听客——她美丽又年轻，虽然身材有些像所谓的汤团；不过我本人并不讨厌这个——她点起一支蜡烛，瞧一眼时钟顶上的制作干草者，这个小人儿正不紧不慢地收割时间；又看看窗外，外边漆黑一片，什么都看不见，只有她自己的脸映照在玻璃上。我的意见是（你的意见可能一样）她可能看到了很远的地方，却没有发现半点可喜的东西。她回来坐到原来的座位上去，这时候，蟋蟀和水壶还在唱着，狂热地竞赛着。水壶不知道自己已经输了，它的弱点明摆在那里。

这真是一场十分激烈的竞赛。啾啾，啾啾，啾啾！蟋蟀领先一英里。哼唔，哼唔，哼唔——唔——唔！水壶在后面追赶，歪歪斜斜像一只大陀螺。啾啾，啾啾，啾啾！蟋蟀拐弯了。哼唔，哼唔，哼唔——唔——唔！水壶用自己的方式紧追不舍，丝毫不让。啾啾，啾啾，啾啾！蟋蟀更为精神抖擞。哼唔，哼唔，哼唔——唔——唔！水壶稳扎稳打。啾啾，啾啾，啾啾！蟋蟀快要赢了。哼唔，哼唔，哼唔——唔——唔！水壶不让它赢。直到末了，它们在这场急急忙忙、慌慌张张的竞赛中乱成一团。究竟是水壶啾啾，蟋蟀哼唔；还是蟋蟀啾啾，水壶哼唔；或者两个都啾啾，两个都哼唔，就需要比你我更清楚的头脑来做近乎肯定的判断了。不过，这一点是没有疑问的：水壶和蟋蟀在同时同刻，由它们自己最明白的一种混合力量，把它们两个的愉快的炉边之歌吹送到烛光里去，烛光透过窗棂照到小巷深处。这道光忽然照到这时正在从黑暗中走来的一个人身上，真正在一眨眼的工夫就把整个事情都告诉了他，并且喊道：“欢迎你回家，老朋友！欢迎你回家，我的孩子！”

这个目的达到之后，水壶则已经一蹶不振，煮得滚开，被人从炉火上拎走了。于是皮瑞宾格尔太太飞奔到门口，在一阵车轮声、马蹄声、人声、一只激动的狗窜进窜出声、一个婴儿神秘地出现引起的惊异声中，那位某某先生立刻露面了。

那个婴儿是打哪儿来的，皮瑞宾格尔太太又怎样在一刹那间接过了他，我可不知道。然而皮瑞宾格尔太太的怀里正抱着一个活泼泼的婴儿；而且似乎因为他而感到相当大的骄傲。这时候，她被那个魁梧伟岸的男子汉轻轻地搀到壁炉前，这个人年纪比她大得多，身材比她高得多，非得弯得很低才能吻到她。不过她是值得别人费事的。身高六英尺六英寸，加上腰部风湿痛，也是能够这么做的。

“哦，天哪，约翰！”皮瑞宾格尔太太喊道，“这种天气把你搞成什么样子了！”

不可否认，他的情况糟糕得很。浓雾像糖饯的融霜凝结成块，挂在他的睫毛上；在迷雾和炉火之间，他的络腮胡子丛中出现了彩虹。

“嗯，你瞧，小不点儿，”约翰一面慢慢地回答，一面从脖子上解下围巾，伸手去烤火，“这——这可不是夏天啊。所以，没有什么奇怪的。”

“约翰，我希望你不要叫我小不点儿，我不喜欢听。”皮瑞宾格尔太太说，噘起的嘴巴却清楚地表明她喜欢，非常喜欢听。

“那么，你又是什么呢？”约翰问，他含笑低头瞧着她，粗壮的手和胳膊在她腰上尽可能轻地夹一下，“一个小不点儿”——说到这里，他望望婴儿——“打点进位[4]——我不说了，我怕说糟了；不过我差不多说了个笑话。我从来没有这样差不多说了笑话呢。”

这个粗陋、迟缓和诚实的约翰，照他自己看来，他常常差不多非常聪明；这个约翰身体笨重，可是精神轻松；表面鲁莽，可是心中温柔；外表鲁钝，可是内里敏感；呆头呆脑，可是宽厚善良！哦，造化母亲啊，赐予你的孩子们以真正诗意的心吧，就像藏在这位贫穷的运货夫胸中的心一样——顺便说一句，他只不过是个运货夫——这样我们才能容忍世人说无味的话，过无味的生活[5]；并且容忍为了你同他们一起而赞美你！

小小身材的小不点儿，抱着婴儿——真像个布娃娃的婴儿——娇媚地、沉思地瞧着炉火，她那微偏着的美丽的小脑袋，以特别的、半自然半做作的、完全像小鸟依人的可爱的姿态，靠在嵯峨高大的运货夫的身上；看到这个景象，真叫人高兴。运货夫温柔而又笨拙地竭力使自己粗鲁的支撑能适合她的轻巧的依偎，并且使自己魁伟的中年身体成为一个称配得起她的青春的花一般的娇躯的支架；看到这个景象，真叫人高兴。蒂蕾·施罗博埃站在后面照应婴儿，注视着（虽然她才十几岁）这场团聚，她张大嘴巴，睁圆眼睛，伸长头颈，把这一切像吸空气似的都吸进去；看到这个景象，真叫人高兴。小不点儿提到上述婴儿的时候，运货夫刚要伸手去摸，又把手缩回来，仿佛怕自己会碰破他；于是哈着腰，离得不远不近地打量着，带着迷惑而又自豪的表情，要是一只好性子的大狗有一天发现自己是一只金丝雀的爸爸，就会有这样的表情；看到这个景象，同样叫人高兴。

“约翰，他不是很漂亮吗？他睡觉的样子不是很可爱吗？”

“真可爱，”约翰说，“非常可爱。他老是睡觉，是吗？”

“老天哪，约翰！哪有这种事！”

“哦，”约翰思索着说，“我觉得他的眼睛老是闭着。啊呀！”

“天哪，约翰，你的话多么吓人！”

“他的眼睛那样向上翻可不对头！”运货夫吃惊地说，“是不是？你瞧他两只眼睛一起眨巴着！再瞧他的嘴巴！嘿，喘得像金鱼或银鱼似的！”

“你不配做爸爸，才不配呢。”小不点儿说，摆出一副有经验的主妇的十足的气势，“不过，约翰，你怎么能够知道孩子们会给哪些小毛病侵害呢？你连那些病的名称都不知道，你这傻瓜。”她把婴儿换到左臂上，拍拍他的背，抚慰他，然后笑着拧丈夫的耳朵。

“不错，”约翰一面脱去大衣，一面说，“小不点儿，一点也不错。我不大清楚这类事。我只知道今儿晚上我同寒风狠狠搏斗了一场。回家来，一路上尽刮着东北风，直刮到车子里。”

“可怜的老头儿，可不是嘛！”皮瑞宾格尔太太叫道，她立刻变得非常忙碌，“喂？蒂蕾，把小宝贝儿抱去，我要干别的事情了。哎呀，我把他亲得透不过气来了，真的！去，去，好狗！去，拳击手，狗儿！让我先给你烧茶吧，约翰，然后我再像一只忙碌的蜜蜂，帮你搬包裹。约翰，你会吧，‘小东西怎么样’——还有其余的词儿。约翰，你从前上学的时候可曾学过，‘小东西怎么样’？”

“不大会，”约翰回答，“我曾经差不多会了，不过我敢说我只会唱糟了它。”

“哈哈，”小不点儿笑起来，你从来没有听到过像她这样的最欢乐的可爱的笑声，“说真的，约翰，你真是一个可爱的老傻瓜啊！”

约翰对这种称号丝毫没有抗辩，他走出去看看那个手拿提灯照料马匹的小伙子。那提灯在门窗前摇晃，像是鬼火。要是我告诉你那匹马的体重，那准是比你愿意相信的更肥胖；而且它老迈得连生日都消失在过去的迷雾之中了。拳击手觉得自己应该对全家大小献殷勤，并且必须公平分配，因此令人困惑、反复无常地窜进窜出：一会儿，绕着正在马厩门前让人刷毛的马汪汪吠叫一圈；一会儿，假装突然冲击女主人，又突然滑稽地刹住；一会儿，对坐在炉边育婴矮椅上的蒂蕾·施罗博埃的脸，冷不防地伸出鼻子，引得她一声尖叫；一会儿，莽撞地显示出对婴儿的兴趣；一会儿，在炉边一圈圈地打转转，再躺下来，仿佛已经给自己选定了过夜的地方；一会儿，又站起来，拖着它那段毫无用处的短尾巴，走出门去，仿佛刚刚记起一个约会，便匆匆跑去赴约。

“喏！茶炊搁在炉台上了！”小不点儿说，她像孩子玩照管家务游戏那样生气勃勃地忙起来，“这是冷猪膝火腿，这是牛油，这是脆皮面包；都在这儿啦！约翰，这是放换洗衣服的篮子，可以放小包裹，要是你带了来的话——约翰，你在哪儿呀？蒂蕾，不论你在干什么，千万别把小宝贝儿掉到炉格子底下去啊！”

或许该提一提，施罗博埃小姐尽管带着点高兴的样子不接受这个警告，她却具有使这婴儿遭到麻烦的罕见的惊人天赋。有几次，她就是用她独特的不声不响的方式使这小生命遭遇危险的。这位小姐身材如此瘦削而挺直，以致衣服一直像是要从她两边尖尖的钉子似的肩膀上滑下来，她的衣服挂在那上面可宽松得很。她的装束引人注意，那是一种法兰绒服装，剪裁特别，在一切可能的地方都做了局部改革；在背部，则露出一线暗绿色的胸衣或紧身褡。施罗博埃小姐对于一切事物总是惊讶地赞不绝口，而且永远想着女主人和婴儿的优点，想得出神入迷。她判断事物时是很少失误的，可以说，这给她的头脑和心都增添了光彩；她的头脑和心对婴儿的头却稍欠敬意，时不时把它碰到木板门上、梳妆台上、楼梯栏杆上、床柱上，以及其他毫不相干的东西上。虽然如此，蒂蕾·施罗博埃却一直惊奇地发现自己被这个温暖的家庭这样宽容地对待和接纳，这些都是真实的结果。施罗博埃的双亲是谁，无从知道，因为她是一个在公立慈善机构里长大的弃儿。弃儿和爱儿只差一个字，可是意义大不相同，所表明的完全是两码事。

你要是看见小皮瑞宾格尔太太同她丈夫把那只换洗衣篮搬回来，她用尽所有的力气去拖，却丝毫不起作用（因为她丈夫搬着篮子），一定会像她丈夫一样觉得有趣。据我所知，那只蟋蟀也觉得有趣；的确如此，它现在又热情奔放地啾啾唱起来了。

“啊呀！”约翰用他缓慢的声调喊道，“我觉得它今儿晚上比平常更高兴哪。”

“约翰，它一定会给我们带来好运气！它一直带给我们好运的。炉边有一只蟋蟀是世界上最幸运的事！”

约翰盯着她，好像头脑中差不多认为她就是他的蟋蟀王，并且十分赞同她的意见。然而，这或许是他的一个稍纵即逝的念头，因为他什么都没有说。

“约翰，我头一次听到它快乐的小声音，是你把我带到家里来的那天晚上——你把我带到我这个新家里来，让我成了这个家的小主妇。这快有一年了。你记得吗，约翰？”

哦，是的。约翰记得。当然记得！

“我听了它的叫声真是喜欢！那声音似乎充满了希望和鼓励。它似乎在说，你会待我温存和善，而不会期望（我那时候担心着哪，约翰）在你愚笨的小妻子的肩膀之上长着一个老脑袋。”

约翰亲切地拍拍她的肩膀，再拍拍她的头，好像在说：当然，当然，他没有这样期望过；他很满意她这个样子的肩膀和脑袋。而且他确实有道理：那肩膀和脑袋非常可爱。

“约翰，蟋蟀仿佛在说这些话的时候，说的是真话，因为毫无疑问你对我来说一直是最好、最体贴、最深情的丈夫。约翰，这是个幸福的家；因此我爱这只蟋蟀！”

“是啊，我也是这样，”运货夫说，“我也是这样呢，小不点儿。”

“我爱它，因为它的鸣唱我听过许多次，它的友善的歌声曾经引起我许多遐想。约翰，有时候，在暮色朦胧中，我感到一点孤独和忧郁——那是在婴儿出世来陪伴我，并且使得屋子里热闹起来以前——我还想到要是我死了，你会多么孤单；亲爱的，当我想到你要是失去我，你会觉得多么孤单。在这种时候，它在炉边啾啾啾啾啾啾叫着，就像用另一种细小的声音在跟我说话，使我感到那么甜蜜，那么亲切，它的声音一传来，我的烦恼就像梦一样消失了。我曾经常常害怕——我害怕过，约翰，你知道我那时是很不懂事的——我们的婚姻不和谐，因为我简直是个孩子，而你与其说像是我的丈夫，倒不如说像是我的保护人。我还害怕，不管你怎样用尽办法，要学会能像你自己所希望、所祈祷的那样爱我，却办不到。在这种时候，它啾啾啾啾啾啾地鸣唱，就曾使我重新愉快起来，使我充满了新的信任和信心。亲爱的，今儿晚上我坐着盼望你来的时候，正想着这些事情；为了这些事情，我爱那只蟋蟀！”

“我也这样，”约翰又说，“不过，小不点儿，难道我曾希望和祈祷自己学会爱你吗？你这是什么话呀？小不点儿，在我把你带到这里来做蟋蟀的小女主人以前，我早就学会这个了！”

她把手在他的臂膀上搁了一会儿，神色激动地朝他仰望，仿佛想跟他说什么。接着她在换洗衣篮前跪下来，一面整理小包裹，一面用兴奋的声调说话。

“约翰，今儿晚上包裹不多，不过我刚才看见车子后边有些货物；或许这些东西增加了麻烦，可是同样能够挣到钱；因此我们没有理由抱怨，是吗？还有，我敢说你一路回来已经送掉一些了，是不是？”

“哦，是的，”约翰说，“送掉了好多。”

“咦，这个圆盒子里装的什么？哎呀，约翰，是个结婚蛋糕哪！”

“只有女人猜得出来，”约翰称赞着，“要是男人可怎么也想不到。这样看来，我相信即使把一个结婚蛋糕装在茶叶箱里、翻过来的床架子里、腌鲑鱼的小桶里，或者其他种种东西里，女人都一定能够马上猜出来。不错，我是从面包店里带来的。”

“它重得我说不上来——一百多磅总是有了！”小不点儿嚷着，费尽力气打算把它提起来，“约翰，这是谁的蛋糕？要送到哪儿去？”

“看看另一边写的字吧。”约翰说。

“啊呀，约翰！我的天哪，约翰！”

“是啊！谁料想得到！”约翰回答。

“难道说，”小不点儿接着说，她坐在地板上对他摇头，“这竟然是玩具商格拉夫和泰克尔顿的！”

约翰点点头。

皮瑞宾格尔太太也点点头，至少点了五十下。这并不是赞同——而是默默地惋惜和惊异。这时她用尽小力气扭歪着嘴巴（我很清楚，她的嘴巴生来绝不是为了扭歪用的），茫茫然、直愣愣地盯着善良的运货夫瞧。施罗博埃小姐具有一种机械地重复当时谈话的片段的本事，来逗乐那个婴儿。她把话中的意思一概去掉，名词一概改为复数，这时候，她便这样出声问着小宝宝：那么，是那些玩具商那些格拉夫和泰克尔顿吗？那些结婚蛋糕是从那些面包店里带来的吗？那些爸爸把那些盒子拿回家来，他的那些妈妈是不是猜到了呢？等等。

“这么说来事情是真的了，”小不点儿说，“哎，约翰，她跟我小时候是同学呢。”

他可能已经想到她，或者差不多想到她和她在一个学校里的时候的情景。他亲切地、乐滋滋地瞧着她，可是不说话。

“那个男人多么老啊！多么不像她啊！——哎，约翰，格拉夫和泰克尔顿比你大多少岁来着？”

“我真想知道，今儿晚上我一次喝掉的茶，会比格拉夫和泰克尔顿四次喝的多几杯！”约翰轻松愉快地说，把一张椅子拖到圆桌前，吃起冷火腿来，“至于吃东西呢，我吃得很少；不过，小不点儿，这很少的一份我很满意。”

这是他吃饭的时候常常流露的感情，是他一种天真的错觉（因为跟他说的截然相反，他的食欲总是难以餍足），可是，即使这句话也没有在他小妻子的脸上逗出微笑来。妻子正站在那些包裹中间，慢慢地把蛋糕盒子踢开，虽然眼睛也朝下看，可是一眼也没有瞧她平常总是念念不忘的漂亮的鞋子。她站在那儿，想得出了神，忘掉了吃茶，也忘掉了约翰（虽然他呼唤她，又用刀敲敲桌子惊醒她），于是约翰站起身来碰碰她的胳臂。她对他看了一会儿，便连忙走到茶盘后面她的座位上去，对自己的失神不禁失笑。不过，她不像先前那样笑了，神态和声音都变了许多。

蟋蟀也停止了鸣唱。房子里不知怎的不像原来那样欢乐了。一点也不像了。

“那么，约翰，包裹就是这些了，是吗？”她说，打破了长久的沉默。在沉默的时间里，诚实的运货夫专心致志地把他最爱表达的观点的一部分做了一番实际的说明——他吃得确实满意，虽然我们不能承认他吃得很少。“那么，约翰，包裹就是这些了，是吗？”

“就是这些，”约翰说，“哎——不对——我——”他放下刀叉，倒抽了一大口气，“的的确确——我把那位老先生忘得干干净净了！”

“老先生？”

“在车子里，”约翰说，“我刚才看见他的时候，他在草堆里睡着哪。走进屋子以后，我其实差不多有两次想起了他，可是他又从我脑子里跑掉了。啊呀！哎哟！醒来吧！我的天哪！”

约翰拿了一支蜡烛急急忙忙跑出去，后面的话是他在门外喊的。

关于“老先生”施罗博埃小姐感到这三个字里有一种神秘的味儿[6]，就在自己神秘的想象中，把一种宗教性质的联想同这三个字联系起来，这使她慌得不得了，忙不迭地从炉边矮椅上蹦起来，跑到女主人裙边去寻求庇护；可是经过门边的时候，她正好跟一个陌生的老头儿打了个照面，便本能地举起手头仅有的攻击工具，对他袭击或者冲撞起来，这个工具恰巧就是那个婴儿。这不免发生了一场大风波、大骚乱，聪明伶俐的拳击手更推波助澜；因为这条好狗比主人更细心，看来它一直在看守这位睡觉的老先生，怕他把缚在车子后边的几株白杨树苗偷走；它这会儿还在亦步亦趋地跟着他，事实上在咬他的绑腿，拼命进攻那上面的纽扣。

“你真是个了不起的瞌睡家，先生。”骚乱平息之后，约翰说。这时候，老先生光着头，一动也不动地站在屋中央。“我几乎想问你那另外六位到哪儿去了[7]——不过这就是说笑话了，我知道自己会说糟的。不过差不多已经说了，”运货夫低声说着，哧哧笑着，“差不多！”

这位生客披着长长的白发，面貌和善，一副轮廓特别分明和显然的老年人的样子，他用黑亮锐利的眼睛含笑地环顾了一下，并向运货夫的妻子庄重地颔首致意。

他的服装稀奇古怪——早已过时了。一身装扮都是棕褐色的。手里也拿着一根棕褐色的大棍子，或者手杖；他把这东西往地上一敲，它就散开，变成了一张椅子，他便往上一坐，神态洒脱而又自在。

“你瞧！”运货夫掉头对妻子说，“我就是这样遇见他坐在路边的！坐得笔直，像个里程碑似的，而且几乎聋得也像个里程碑。”

“露天坐着吗，约翰？”

“露天坐着，”运货夫回答，“正是黄昏时分。他说‘出钱搭车’，给了我十八个便士。他上了车，就到这里来了。”

“约翰，我想他就要走的吧？”

完全不对。他只不过是要说话了。

“要是你们答应，我打算待下来，直到别人来接我回去，”生客温和地说，“不用管我。”

他说完了话就从一只大口袋里掏出一副眼镜，从另一只大口袋里掏出一本书，悠闲地看起来。他毫不在意拳击手，就像它是一只绵羊似的！

运货夫和妻子交换了一个困惑的眼神。生客抬起头来，看看她，再望望他，问道：

“是你的女儿吗，我的好朋友？”

“妻子。”约翰回答。

“侄女？”生客问。

“妻子！”约翰大声说。

“真的吗？”生客打量着，“确实吗？年纪很小嘛！”

他静静地翻着书，继续看下去。可是还没有看完两行字，又停下来问道：

“这婴儿，是你们的吗？”

约翰用力地对他点点头，等于是从喇叭里给予了一个肯定的答复。

“女孩儿？”

“男——孩——儿！”约翰大声说。

“也很小嘛，嗯？”

皮瑞宾格尔太太立刻插进来：“两个月零三——天！刚在六个星期以前种了牛——痘！发得很——好！医生说这个孩子长得很漂——亮！大得相当于一般五个月的孩——子！了不起地懂——事！你或许认为不可能，可是他真的会站——立——了！”

喘不过气来的小母亲对着老头儿的耳朵嚷着这些短句子，嚷得美丽的脸涨得通红。她接着把婴儿捧到他面前，作为一个扎扎实实、得意扬扬的事实。这时候，蒂蕾·施罗博埃发出有调子的“咳乞，咳乞”的喊声——听起来像是一种适合于流行性喷嚏的莫名其妙的话——同时绕着完全无知的婴儿像牛儿一样蹦着、跳着。

“听啊！人家来接他了，准是的，”约翰说，“有人在门外哪。蒂蕾，开门。”

可是，她还没有走到门口，门已经被人从外边打开了；因为那是老式的门，谁要愿意，就可以去开闩——许多人都愿意，因为左邻右舍各种各样的人都喜欢跟运货夫畅谈几句，虽然他本人并不是健谈家。门打开，进来一个脸色黝黑、若有所思的瘦小的人，他的大衣看来像是用一块盖什么旧箱子的麻袋布做的；因为他转身关门不让冷风吹进来的时候，大衣背上出现大大的黑色大写字母“G&T”[8]，还有“玻璃”两个大字。

“晚上好，约翰！”瘦小的人说，“晚上好，太太。晚上好，蒂蕾。晚上好，陌生人！婴儿好吗，太太？拳击手很好吧，我想？”

“大家都康康泰泰，凯莱布，”小不点儿说，“我相信你只需要看一眼这个小宝宝就知道了。”

“我相信，我只需第二眼再看看你。”凯莱布说。

然而他并没有朝她看；他的目光散漫而若有所思，不管他在说什么，目光老是好像投射在另一个时间和另一处地方；这种情况同样可以用来形容他的言语。

“或者再看看约翰，”凯莱布说，“或者就这一点来说，看看蒂蕾。或者，当然啦，看看拳击手。”

“近来忙吗，凯莱布？”运货夫问。

“是啊，相当忙，约翰，”他回答，那种心神错乱的神气，至少像个寻觅点金石的人，“忙得很。现在‘挪亚方舟’[9]很畅销。我本来想把那个家庭改进一下，可是我不知道价钱方面怎么办。要是将哪一个是闪，哪一个是含，哪些个是媳妇，做得更清楚，那可是桩叫人高兴的事。你知道，跟大象比较起来，那些苍蝇也不成比例。啊，对了！约翰，你运送的东西里可有我的包裹？”

运货夫把手伸进脱下来的外衣口袋里，摸出一个用青苔和纸仔细保护着的小花盆。

“这就是了！”他小心翼翼地修整着这东西说，“连一片叶子都没有弄坏呢，还长满了骨朵儿。”

凯莱布接过花盆，向他道谢，呆滞的眼睛亮起来。

“很贵，凯莱布，”运货夫说，“在这季节里这东西贵得很。”

“没关系。不管多少钱，我都认为便宜，”瘦小的人说，“还有别的吗，约翰？”

“还有个小盒子，”运货夫回答，“就是这个！”

“‘凯莱布·普卢默收’，”瘦小的人念着上面的字，“‘注意现金’。约翰，现金吗？我想这个不是我的。”

“‘注意安全’，”运货夫从他的肩头看过去，回答说，“你怎么看成现金[10]了？”

“哦！不错！”凯莱布说，“完全正确。注意安全！是的，是的，这是我的。约翰，要是我亲爱的孩子在黄金般的南美洲还活着的话，这可能真的是现金呢。你爱那个孩子像你自己的一样，不是吗？你不必说是。当然，我知道。‘凯莱布·普卢默。注意安全。’是的，是的，完全正确。这是一盒布娃娃的眼睛，我女儿工作上用的。约翰，我希望盒子里装的是她自己的目光。”

“我希望真是这样，或者能够这样！”运货夫大声说。

“谢谢你，”瘦小的人说，“你说得非常真诚。想想看，她永远看不见那些布娃娃——布娃娃却一天到晚眼睛直愣愣地看着她！正是这个叫人心疼。约翰，运送费是多少？”

“你要是问的话，”约翰说，“我就叫你受不了。小不点儿！差不多吧？”

“啊！这正是你这样的人说的话呢，”瘦小的人说，“你老是这样好心。让我想想看。我想没别的事了。”

“我想不见得，”运货夫说，“你再想想看。”

“还有什么东西给咱们老板的吧，啊？”凯莱布想了一会儿之后说，“不错。我就是为这个来的；可是我的脑子里想的尽是方舟什么的！他没到这儿来过吧，是不是？”

“他不会来，”运货夫回答，“他太忙了，忙着求爱哪。”

“不过他就要来的，”凯莱布说，“他叫我在回家的路上一直靠左边走，他十有八九会把我带上车。那么，我最好走了——太太，你不能宽容地让我把拳击手的尾巴掐一把吧，能吗？”

“怎么啦，凯莱布！这是什么意思？”

“哦，没关系，太太，”瘦小的人说，“它或许不愿意的。刚不久接到一小批订货，要会叫的狗。为了六便士，我希望尽可能做得跟真的一样。就是这个。没关系，太太。”

拳击手并没有受到别人打算给予的刺激，却恰好在这时候拼命大叫起来。不过这叫声是表示有位新客人来了，凯莱布便把他的研究计划推迟到以后比较适当的时候，自己扛起那个圆盒子赶快离开那儿。他本来可以省掉这个麻烦，因为他在门口碰到了那个客人。

“哦！你在这儿，可不是吗？等一等。我带你回家。约翰·皮瑞宾格尔，向你问好。更多地向你美丽的妻子问好。祝她一天比一天漂亮！要是可能的话，祝她更好，还祝她更年轻，”这个人放低嗓门考虑着说，“这是顶要紧的事！”

“泰克尔顿先生，”小不点儿并不十分高兴地说，“要不是你现在的情况，你这些客套真要使我吃惊。”

“那么事情你全都知道啦？”

“我还曾设法使自己相信呢。”小不点儿说。

“经过一番艰苦斗争，是吧？”

“不错。”

一般都管玩具商泰克尔顿叫作格拉夫和泰克尔顿——因为商号是这个名称，虽然格拉夫早已出让了产权，在业务上只留下他的名字，以及像某些人说的，他的脾气，这个脾气可以用他的名字在字典上的意义来说明[11]——玩具商泰克尔顿这个人，他的职业曾经被他的父母和保护人误解过。要是他们过去使他成为一个放债人，或者一个厉害的律师，或者一个州官，或者一个经纪人，那么他年轻的时候可能胡闹一番，然后在坏事做尽做绝之后，为了换一下口味，尝一点新鲜，可能终于变得可爱一些。可是，他却一直安分守己地蜷缩和挣扎在玩具制造行业中，于是变成一个深入家庭的食人魔怪，一生都靠儿童来生活，是他们不共戴天的仇敌。他轻视一切玩具，死也不肯去买一个，却喜欢恶意地把可怕的表情暗暗描画在这些人的脸庞上：赶猪上市场的褐色的纸做的农民；通告律师良心丧失的敲钟人；补袜子或者切面饼的可以活动的老婆婆；以及他的货品中诸如此类的人物。至于鬼面具，讨厌的满脸胡须、眼睛通红的盒子老头[12]，吸血蝙蝠风筝，不肯躺下来、老是向前翻、眼睛直愣愣地看得幼童要哭的恶魔似的不倒翁，对于这些东西，他打心眼里感到得意。这些是他唯一的安慰和安全阀。他在这种创造方面是个杰出人物。任何使人联想到梦魇兽的事物，他都深感兴趣。他甚至制作出妖魔幻灯片来，那上面的魑魅魍魉都被画成一种超自然的长着人脸的贝类，因而赔了本（他却打心眼里喜爱这种玩具）。为了使这些怪物肖像更为动人，他投下了不小的资本；虽然他自己不是画家，但是他可以用一支粉笔给他的艺术家们做出指示，让他们在那些魔怪的脸上留下一种诡诈的邪笑，这副样子保证可以在整个圣诞节或者暑假期间，使年龄在六岁到十一岁之间的任何一位小先生的和平心境遭到破坏。

他对待玩具的态度，也就是他（像大多数人一样）对待其他事物的态度。因此，你可能很容易地猜想到，包在那件长到小腿的绿斗篷里边的，是一个纽扣直扣到下巴颏儿的特别有趣的人；并且猜想到，他是穿了一双赤褐色长筒的样子顽固的靴子的一个头等的人物，可爱的伙伴儿。

可是，这个玩具商泰克尔顿就要结婚了。尽管如此种种，他就要结婚了。而且还是跟一个年轻的女士——一个美丽的年轻的女士结婚呢。

他站在运货夫的厨房里，干瘪的脸歪着，身子扭着，帽子拉到鼻梁上，双手一直插到口袋底，他的刁钻刻薄的心性从他一只小眼睛的角落里透露出来，好像一群乌鸦的邪恶集中到了一起。他这副样子可不大像一个新郎。可是，他偏偏要做新郎了。“再过三天，星期四，今年头一个月的最后一天，就是我结婚的日子。”泰克尔顿说。

我可曾说过，他总是一只眼睛睁得大大的，一只眼睛眯成一条缝，而那只眯起的眼睛总是富于表情呢？我想我没有说过。

“那就是我结婚的日子！”泰克尔顿说，把钱币弄得“咔啦咔啦”响。

“咦，那也是我们结婚的日子呢。”运货夫嚷着。

“哈哈！”泰克尔顿笑起来，“怪事！你们正好也是这样的一对。正好！”

对于这种无礼的说法，小不点儿的愤怒是难以形容的。下一步呢？他或许竟然想入非非，说正好也是这样的婴儿哪。这个人疯了。

“听着！跟你说句话，”泰克尔顿小声说，他用胳膊肘儿捅捅运货夫，领他走开一些，“你们来参加婚礼吗？你知道，咱们是难兄难弟。”

“怎么是难兄难弟？”运货夫问。

“你知道，有点儿不般配，”泰克尔顿说，又捅了一下，“提前来跟我们消遣一个黄昏吧。”

“为什么？”约翰问，对他这副殷勤恳切劲儿感到惊讶。

“为什么？”对方回一句，“这样子接受邀请可新鲜哩。嘿，你知道，为了乐和乐和——交际交际，就是这号事！”

“我还以为你从来不交际的。”约翰坦率地说。

“啊呀！我懂了，跟你说话非得直截了当不行。”泰克尔顿说，“嘿，那么，是这样，你跟你妻子两个人具有一种爱喝茶的民族所谓的讨人喜欢的外表。你知道，我们更清楚，不过——”

“不，我们并不更清楚，”约翰打断他的话，“你在说什么呀？”

“好吧！那么我们就并不更清楚，”泰克尔顿说，“我们同意我们并不如此。随便你好啦；那有什么关系？我要说的是，你们既然具有那种外表，你们的光临就会对未来的泰克尔顿太太产生良好的影响。对于这桩事情，虽然我并不认为你的好太太会很赞成我，可是她还是不得不同意我的看法，因为，即使在无关紧要的情况下，她小巧又安详的样子总能说明问题。你说你们打算来吗？”

“我们已经准备在家里（就这件事来说）过结婚纪念日，”约翰说，“我们自己约定了六个月了。你明白，我们觉得，家——”

“呸！家是什么？”泰克尔顿喊道，“四堵墙加一个天花板罢了！（你们为什么不把那只蟋蟀弄死？我就要弄死它！我一直这么办。我讨厌蟋蟀的叫声。）我的屋子也是四堵墙加一个天花板。到我家来吧！”

“你弄死你的蟋蟀，啊？”约翰问。

“嘎吱嘎吱地跺死它们，先生，”对方回答，把脚后跟重重地往地上跺，“你说你们打算来吗？你知道，这正像对我一样，对你也有好处，因为女人家会彼此说服对方，认为自己过得清静而又满意，别人甭想比得上。我懂得她们的心理。这个女人不管说了什么，那个女人总是决心斗个高低。先生，她们之间有那么一种竞争精神，如果你的妻子对我的妻子说：‘我是世界上最幸福的女人，我的丈夫是世界上最好的男人，我真爱他。’那么，我的妻子就会对她说同样的话，或者还添油加醋，而且差不多就相信了。”

“那么，你是说她并不那样吗？”运货夫问。

“并不那样！”泰克尔顿喊道，尖着嗓子笑了一笑，“并不什么？”

运货夫几乎要想接上去说：“爱你。”可是，他恰好瞧见那只半闭的眼睛从翻起来的斗篷领子上面对他着，那个领子差点儿把眼睛挤出来，他觉得这部分绝没有任何可爱之处可言，于是改口说：“她并不相信？”

“啊，你这狗！你在说笑话。”泰克尔顿说。

可是运货夫还不完全了解他话中的意思，因而十分严肃地盯住他，因此他需要作更多的解释。

“我有这种兴致，”泰克尔顿说，举起左手的指头，敲敲那根食指，表示“这就是我泰克尔顿”，“先生，我有这种兴致来讨一个年轻的老婆，漂亮的老婆。”说到这里，他带着威风凛凛的样子，不是客气地，而是神气地拍拍小指头，代表新娘。“我既然有力量满足这种兴致，我就这样办了。这是我一时高兴。不过——你看那边！”

他指着小不点儿，她正坐在炉火前沉思着，手托着有酒窝的腮帮子，眼望着红光闪闪的火苗。运货夫看看她，再看看他，再看看她，然后再看看他。

“你知道，毫无疑问，她恭敬而又顺从，”泰克尔顿说，“而我既然不是一个多愁善感的男人，这对我就足够了。不过，在这方面你想还有什么问题吗？”

“我想，”运货夫说，“要是谁说没有的话，我就要把他扔到窗外去。”

“完全正确，”对方一反常态地欣然赞同说，“那还用说！你无疑会那样做。当然如此。我坚信这一点。再见。做个好梦！”

运货夫感到迷惑，不由自主地变得局促不安起来，神情上也不禁透露了出来。

“再见，我亲爱的朋友！”泰克尔顿怜悯地说，“我要走了。我明白了，咱们两个实际上一模一样。你们不打算明天傍晚在我们那儿消磨吗？好吧！我知道你们明天要到我家去做客。我在那儿跟你们见面吧，还要带上我未来的妻子。这对她有好处。你赞成吗？谢谢你。那是什么声音！”

那是运货夫的妻子在高声喊叫：又响，又尖，又突然，叫得这屋子像玻璃缸似的回响着。她已经从座位上跳起来，好像被恐怖和惊奇吓呆了的人那样站着。那个陌生人已经来到壁炉前烤火，站在离她椅子一步远的地方。不过很安静。

“小不点儿！”运货夫喊道，“玛丽！亲爱的！出了什么事？”

他们立刻都围到她身边来。拿着那盒蛋糕打瞌睡的凯莱布在迷迷糊糊还没有完全清醒过来的状态中，一下子揪住了施罗博埃小姐的头发，不过立刻道了歉。

“玛丽！”运货夫喊着，一把抱住了她，“你不舒服吗？怎么回事？告诉我，亲爱的！”

她不回答，只管拍着手，忽然纵声大笑起来。接着，从他的怀抱中滑到地板上，用围裙捂住脸，放声痛哭起来。接着，又笑；接着，又哭；然后说觉得冷得很，便让他扶到壁炉前，像原先那样坐下来。那个老人像原先那样站着，很安静。

“我好些了，约翰，”她说，“我现在很好了——我——”

“约翰！”可是约翰是在她的那一面。她为什么把头转向那个奇怪的老先生，仿佛在跟他说话！难道她神经错乱了吗？

“约翰，亲爱的，只不过是个幻觉——一种震惊——一件东西突然出现在我眼前——我不知道那是什么。现在它已经没了，没了。”

“我很高兴它已经没了，”泰克尔顿咕哝着说，那只富于表情的眼睛对全室瞟了一圈，“我不知道它到哪儿去了，它又是什么。喂！凯莱布，到这儿来！那个白头发的人是谁？”

“我不知道，先生，”凯莱布悄悄地回答，“我这辈子从来没看见过他。作为一个胡桃钳倒是很漂亮，式样很新。在他背心那儿开一个螺旋钳牙，他就很可爱了。”

“不够丑。”泰克尔顿说。

“或者，也可以作为一个火柴盒，”凯莱布颇费思量地说道，“多好的样子！把他的头拧开来，装进火柴；把他翻过来脚底朝天，做擦火用；就像他那样站着，拿来做一位先生的壁炉架上的火柴盒子可多好啊！”

“的确很不够丑，”泰克尔顿说，“他微不足道！来吧！拿着盒子！现在好了吧，我想？”

“哦，已经没了！没了！”这个小女人说，匆匆地挥手送他走，“再见！”

“再见，”泰克尔顿说，“再见，约翰·皮瑞宾格尔！凯莱布，拿着那只盒子要小心。掉下来我就要你的命！外边漆黑一片，天气更坏了，啊？再见！”

于是，他又一次对屋里狠狠地看了一遍，便走到门外去了。凯莱布头顶着结婚蛋糕，随后跟着。

运货夫被他的小妻子吓坏了，忙着安慰和照顾她，因此一直没有留意那个陌生人在场，直到现在他又站在那儿，成了他们唯一的客人，他才发觉。

“你看，他不是跟他们一起的，”约翰说，“我必须给他暗示请他走了。”

“对不起，朋友，”老先生却向他走来，说道，“真是对不起，因为我怕你的妻子还没有好，可是像我这样体弱多病，”他摸摸耳朵，摇摇头，“仆人几乎是离不开的，他却还没有来，我怕准是出了什么岔子。这个寒冷的夜晚，曾经使我觉得躲在你的舒服的车子里（但愿我永远不会碰到坏车子），十分满意；现在还是那样寒冷。你是否可以好心容纳我借住一宿？”

“可以，可以，”小不点儿喊道，“可以！当然可以！”

“哦！”运货夫说道，对这样急促的应允感到惊讶，“好吧！我不反对；不过，我还是不太清楚——”

“嘘！”她打断他的话，“约翰哪！”

“不要紧，他聋得很。”约翰肯定地说。

“这我知道，不过——是的，先生，当然可以！可以！当然可以！约翰，我马上给他准备床铺去。”

她匆匆地跑去准备，那种心烦意乱、惊慌失措的样子好生奇怪，运货夫站在那儿看着她，很是惶惑。

“那么他的妈妈们可是去准备那些个床铺了吗？”施罗博埃小姐对婴儿嚷着，“他的那些个帽子脱掉的时候，他的头发可会变成棕色的鬈发吗？可爱的宝贝们坐在那些个火炉旁，可曾吓到他吗？”

人们在疑虑和惊慌的时候，注意力往往容易被琐碎的小事物吸引了去。运货人正是如此：他慢慢地踱来踱去，发现自己竟把这些可笑的话在心中重复了许多遍。这么多的遍数，以至于他都能背得很熟了，却还是像研习功课似的，一遍又一遍地念着。这时候，蒂蕾用手在小小的毛头上施行摩擦，直到她（按照护理惯例）认为足够有益于健康才住手，于是再把婴儿的帽子系上。

“可爱的宝贝们坐在那些个火炉旁，可曾吓到他吗？什么东西吓到了小不点儿呢，我不明白！”运货夫想着，走过来又走过去。

他心中琢磨那个玩具商话里的意思，然而那些话只能使他感到一种模糊不清和捉摸不定的不安。因为，泰克尔顿机灵狡猾着哪；而他总是痛苦地感到自己是那种反应迟钝的人，只言片语的暗示往往领会不了。他心中确实不想把泰克尔顿所说的话跟自己妻子失常的举止联系起来，然而对这两件事情的回想却一起来到心中，他无法把它们分开来。

床铺很快准备好了；那个客人什么点心也不要，只喝了一杯茶就去睡了。于是，小不点儿——她说完全复原了，完全复原了——替丈夫在壁炉边安顿好大椅子；把烟斗装满，递给他；把自己常坐的小凳子放在壁炉边他的身旁。

她总是坐在那只小凳子上。我想她一定有一种想法，认为那是一只会用甜言蜜语哄她去坐的小凳子。

我得说，她是天下四方最最好的装烟斗家，好透好透了。她那根圆滚滚的小手指塞在烟斗里，然后把烟管吹干净，吹过之后，还要装作觉得烟管里边真有什么东西的样子，再吹个十几次，并且把它当作望远镜一样，用一只眼睛对着它望，可爱的小脸好像伤透了脑筋似的皱起来；看到这幅情景，真是了不起的事。说到烟草，她对这个东西完全有办法；在运货夫嘴里衔了烟斗的时候，她拿着纸捻去点火——离他鼻子那么近，却烧不到鼻子——那真是艺术，高超的艺术。

蟋蟀和水壶又唱得响亮起来，承认这一点！红光闪闪的炉火又燃得旺起来，承认这一点！钟上的制作干草的小人儿不被人注意地工作着，承认这一点！运货夫有光滑的前额和舒展的脸，承认这一点，他们当中他最能不假思索了。

他清醒地、沉思地吸着他那只旧烟斗，荷兰时钟在嘀嗒嘀嗒地响着，红红的炉火在照耀着，蟋蟀在鸣唱着，就在这时候，他的家庭的守护神（就是那只蟋蟀）变成仙子的样子，降临这间屋子，并且在运货夫周围变来许多各种各样的家庭。大大小小不同年龄的小不点儿挤满了一屋子。那些小不点儿是一群快乐的孩子，在他面前的田野上奔跑和采摘鲜花；那些害臊的小不点儿站在他求婚时粗壮的身前，半推半就；那些新婚的小不点儿在家门口下车，惊异地接过家屋的钥匙；那些做小母亲的小不点儿，在那些假想的施罗博埃小姐的陪伴下抱着那些婴儿去受洗；那些做主妇的小不点儿仍然年轻貌美，正在乡村舞会上看着那些女儿辈的小不点儿跳舞；那些发胖了的小不点儿被一大群面颊红润的孙儿辈包围缠绕；那些衰老的小不点儿拄着拐杖，趔趔趄趄地向前挪动脚步。那些老态龙钟的运货夫也出现了，脚边还躺着那些瞎了眼的老拳击手；那些年轻人驾驶着那些新车子（篷帐上都写着“皮瑞宾格尔兄弟商号”）；那些卧病的老运货夫，由最体贴的人服侍着；那些死去的运货夫葬在那些墓园里，坟墓上草色青青。蟋蟀把这一切事物展示给他看的时候——他看得很清楚——虽然眼睛是直愣愣地凝视着炉火——他的心情变得轻松而又愉快。因此发自肺腑地感谢他的家神，而不再把格拉夫和泰克尔顿放在心上，正像你一样。

然而，正是这只蟋蟀仙子，还把一个男青年的影像那么近地安排在她的小凳子旁，现在依旧孤孤单单地待在那儿，那是谁呢？它为什么流连不去，靠她那么近，一只臂膀搁在壁炉架上，不断地重复着说：“结婚了！却不是嫁给我！”

哦，小不点儿！哦，有失检点的小不点儿！在你的丈夫的所有印象里，它不应该占一席之地；那么为什么它的阴影竟然落在他的壁炉边了呢？





第二声


凯莱布·普卢默和他的盲女像故事书上说的那样，两个人孤孤单单地生活着——我希望你支持我祝福这些故事，因为在这个凡俗的世界上竟然有此一说！——凯莱布·普卢默和他的盲女两个人孤孤单单地生活在一所破破烂烂的、小得可怜的木屋里，如果把格拉夫和泰克尔顿的红砖房比作一只鼻子的话，这座屋子，说真的，还不如鼻子上的一颗粉刺。格拉夫和泰克尔顿的宅邸是那条街上的伟大事物；而凯莱布·普卢默的房屋，你一两下就能把它捶倒，一车子就能把碎木片拉走。

要是凯莱布·普卢默的房屋遭到这种侵害之后，谁竟然发现它失踪了，他无疑会将它的毁坏称赞为一次巨大的改革。这座屋子跟格拉夫和泰克尔顿的宅邸连在一起，就像藤壶[13]粘在船的龙骨上，或者蜗牛爬在门板上，或者一小簇毒菌长在树枝上一样。不过，格拉夫和泰克尔顿这株粗壮的大树树干正是从它这株幼芽成长起来的；而且，就在这歪歪斜斜的屋顶下面，格拉夫的祖先曾经为过去一代的男女孩童小规模地生产玩具，那些孩童玩着这些玩具，发现它们过时，把它们拆坏，然后这些玩具就与世长辞了。

我说过凯莱布和他可怜的盲女生活在这里。我应该说凯莱布生活在这里，他的可怜的盲女则生活在别的什么地方——生活在凯莱布所布置的一个奇幻的家里，那儿没有贫困和破烂，烦恼也从未侵入过。凯莱布不是一个魔法师，然而那仍然遗留在我们心中的唯一魔法，那深挚的、不死的爱的魔法，在这方面，大自然做了他学习的师傅；在她的传授下，一切奇迹都出现了。

盲女孩儿从来不知道天花板已经变了色，墙壁上到处斑斑点点，灰泥剥落，深深的裂缝每天在延长和加宽，梁木腐朽，摇摇欲坠。盲女孩儿从来不知道铁质生锈，木头烂掉，纸张剥离；房屋的大小、形状和实际的面积在萎缩下去。盲女孩儿从来不知道桌子上放的是样子难看的荷兰陶器和瓦罐；不知道忧愁和沮丧笼罩着屋子；不知道在她视而不见的眼睛前面，凯莱布稀少的头发变得越来越白。盲女孩儿从来不知道他们有一个冷酷、苛刻和索然无味的主人——从来不知道泰克尔顿总归是泰克尔顿；却一直认为他是一个奇怪的幽默家，爱跟他们开玩笑，是他们生活的保护神，却不屑于听到一句感恩戴德的话。

这一切全是凯莱布的法术，全是她的单纯的父亲的法术！不过他的炉边也有一只蟋蟀；失去母亲的盲孩子还很小的时候，父亲悲伤地聆听着它的鸣唱，这个精灵使他感悟到，即使重大的缺失，也几乎可以转变为幸福，于是女孩子就凭借这个方法得到快乐。蟋蟀世家全体都是有魔力的精灵，虽然同它们接触的人并不知道这一点（这是常有的情况）；在那看不见的世界里，没有哪种声音能够比炉灶边的精灵对人类倾诉衷肠的声音更温柔，更真实，使人可以绝对信赖，并且可以十分肯定它除了给人以最亲切的劝告之外，没有别的。

凯莱布和女儿在他们平日做工的屋子里一同工作；这间屋子他们平常也作为起居室。这是一个奇怪的地方，里面有许多完工的和未完工的房屋，给各种身份的娃娃居住，比如中层阶级的娃娃的郊区住屋，下层阶级的娃娃的厨房和单身公寓，上层阶级的娃娃的豪华的城市公馆。这些房屋当中，有的里面已经有了陈设，这是按照估计并且考虑收入有限的娃娃的方便而置备的；还有的，可以拿木架上摆满的桌椅、沙发、床架和窗帘台布等，立刻装配起来，适合最奢侈的阶级使用。贵族、绅士和平民大众横七竖八地躺在篮子里，眼睛直愣愣地瞧着天花板，那些房屋正是为了安顿它们而设计的；在表示它们所属的社会阶级，确定它们各自的身份地位这方面（经验说明，这一点在实际生活中非常难以确定），这些娃娃的制造者大大胜过了常常是刚愎自用和顽固不化的“造物主”；因为他们并不一味依仗缎子、印花布，以及碎片条这类武断的标记，而是添加了更不容误置的显著的个人特点。因此，贵妇人娃娃配着十分匀称的蜡制四肢；不过，只有它和跟它地位同等的娃娃才这样。社会地位比它低一等的娃娃，则用皮制；再低一等的，则用粗布料制。至于平民大众，它们的手臂和腿就用很多从火绒箱里抽出来的火柴制成，它们就是这样——一旦确定了身份，就没有逾矩的可能。

凯莱布·普卢默的屋子里除了娃娃之外，还有他的其他种种手工艺品，比如，“挪亚方舟”，我向你保证，那飞禽走兽挤在里面是异乎寻常地局促；然而不管怎样还是可以把它们从船顶上塞进去，咯嗒咯嗒地摇成最紧的一团。出于一种大胆的诗意的遐想，大部分“挪亚方舟”的舱门上都装有门环；这或许是不合理的附属物，因为它使人想起早上的访客和邮递员来，然而却是建筑物外部一个可喜的装置。这儿还有许许多多满怀忧伤的小货车，车轮滚起来，就会奏出最最悲哀的音乐。还有许多小巧的提琴、鼓，以及其他折磨人的乐器；无数大炮、盾牌、刀剑、长矛和枪支。还有穿红裤子的翻跟头小人儿，不停地爬上高处一根红带子的障碍物，然后头下脚上打另一边翻过去；还有不计其数虽非德高望重，却是道貌岸然的老绅士，疯狂地跳过特为它们嵌在沿街大门口的一根根平置的木钉。还有各式各样的野兽，尤其是所有品种的马，从斑斑点点的圆身子装上四根木条、绕上一条小围巾做鬃毛的马，到威风凛凛的纯种摇动木马，应有尽有。成千上万个稀奇古怪的东西，只要将钥匙一转，便会做出种种荒谬可笑的事情来。这些怪物多得难以计数，因此，要举出人类哪一桩蠢事、恶行，或者缺陷，在凯莱布·普卢默的屋子里，没有其直接或者间接的表征，这也是不易办到的事。这并不是言过其实，因为小小的手柄就能使得男男女女做出种种奇形怪状的动作，正像任何被设计如何动作的玩偶一样。

凯莱布和女儿就坐在这些物品中间工作着。盲女孩儿忙着做娃娃的成衣，凯莱布在给一幢漂亮的四开间住宅的门面上油漆，镶玻璃。

凯莱布脸上的皱纹里隐藏着忧愁，带着十分适合于炼金术士或者深奥的学者的失魂落魄的、懵懵懂懂的神情，一眼看去，这副样子同他的职业，以及周围微不足道的东西，形成奇怪的对照。然而，如果发明创造是为了果腹，再微不足道的东西也变成了非常严肃的事物。撇开这个情况不谈，我自己还是完全不准备说，如果凯莱布是一位宫内大臣[14]、国会议员、律师，或者即使是大投机商的话，他做玩具的时候，就会减少一点奇思怪想，不过我极其怀疑他们这些人是否会像他一样没有坏心眼儿。

“爸爸，昨天晚上，你是穿着那件漂亮的新大衣冒雨出去的吗？”凯莱布的女儿说。

“是穿着那件漂亮的新大衣。”凯莱布回答，眼睛望望屋子里的一根晾衣绳，上文描写过的那件麻袋布做的大衣，正小心地挂在上面晾干。

“爸爸，你买了那件衣服，我多么高兴！”

“而且还是那样的裁缝呢，”凯莱布说，“相当时髦的裁缝。我简直不配。”

盲女儿停下了手中的工作，开心地笑起来：“不配，爸爸！你有什么东西会不配？”

“可是我穿起来有些难为情，”凯莱布说，打量这句话在她欣喜的脸上引起的反应，“的确是这样！我听见孩子和大人在我后面说：‘啊呀，多摩登哪！’这时候我简直抬不起头来。昨天晚上，叫花子死缠着不放的时候，我说我是个非常普通的人，他说：‘不，老爷！上天保佑您老爷不要说这种话！’我真难为情死了。我实在觉得自己没有权利穿这件衣服。”

幸福的盲女孩儿！她乐得心花怒放，高兴得不得了！

“爸爸，我看见你了，”她拍手说，“就像我有了眼睛一样，清清楚楚的。你在我身边的时候我可从不需要这双眼睛。我看见一件蓝色大衣——”

“天蓝色的。”凯莱布说。

“对啦，对啦！天蓝色的！”女孩儿仰起容光焕发的脸喊道，“这种颜色我正可以从神圣的天空想起来！你从前跟我说天空是蓝色的！一件天蓝色的大衣——”

“做得大大的。”凯莱布补充说。

“做得大大的！”盲女孩儿纵声大笑着喊道，“亲爱的爸爸，你穿了那件衣服，眼睛笑眯眯的，脸上乐滋滋的，步子轻快，头发乌黑——看起来多么年轻、漂亮啊！”

“啊呀！啊呀！”凯莱布叫道，“那我一定会得意扬扬了！”

“我想你已经这样了，”盲女孩儿兴高采烈地指着他嚷道，“我知道你，爸爸！哈，哈，哈！你瞧，我已经猜出来啦！”

她心中的景象跟坐在那儿瞧着她的凯莱布是多么不同啊！她说他步子轻快，倒没有说错。许多年以来，他从来没有用自己缓慢的步履跨进门槛，而是用欺瞒她耳朵的脚步声；即使在心情最沉重的时候，他也从来没有忘记要用会让她的心充满愉快和勇气的轻快的脚步声！

天知道！不过我认为凯莱布迷迷糊糊的神情，可能一半是由于目盲的女儿的缘故，才使他自己和周围的一切把他自己搞昏了头。这个瘦小的人，许多年来的辛劳就是为了要消除他自己的个性，以及所有跟他的个性有关联的东西的个性，他不变得迷迷糊糊的，又会怎样呢？

“咳，瞧吧，”凯莱布说着往后退了一两步，以便更好地鉴赏自己的作品，“简直跟真的一样，就像值六个便士的半便士跟一枚六便士一样。多么可惜，房子的正面一下子整个儿开开了！哎，要是里边有楼梯，走到每个房间都有门，那可多么好！不过这是我的职业的最坏的缺点，我老是糊弄自己，蒙骗自己。”

“你的话音很微弱。爸爸，你累了吧？”

“累了！”凯莱布忽然生气勃勃地应声说，“蓓莎，什么东西会使我累？我从来不累。累是什么意思？”

壁炉架上有两个伸懒腰、打呵欠的半身像，腰部以上永远表现处于疲倦的一种状态；凯莱布不由自主地模仿起来，然而为了使自己的话增加分量，又忍住了，却哼起一段歌曲来。这是酒神的信徒之歌[15]，唱的是关于一只闪闪发光的酒杯的事。他用一种漫不经心的嗓音唱，反而使他的脸瘦了一千倍，而且比平常更为愁眉不展。

“怎么！你唱起歌来了？”泰克尔顿在门外伸进头来说，“唱呀，我可不会唱。”

谁也没有认为他会唱。他丝毫没有通常所谓的唱歌的人该有的脸蛋儿。

“我没有闲工夫唱歌，”泰克尔顿说，“我高兴你倒有。我希望你也有工夫做工才好。不大有时间两者兼顾吧，我想？”

“蓓莎，要是你能看见他怎么对我眨眼睛，那多好！”凯莱布轻声说，“要是你不知道他，你会想，这样的人会开玩笑吗？他是说真的呢——你此刻不是这样想吗？”

盲女孩儿点头微笑。

“人家说，会唱而不唱的鸟必须使它唱，”泰克尔顿粗声粗气地说，“那么不会唱，不该唱，而一定要唱的猫头鹰该怎么办呢？难道有什么理由必须使它唱吗？”

“他这时候眼睛的神气呀！”凯莱布对女儿轻声说，“哦，我的天！”

“对我们总是这样轻松愉快！”微笑的蓓莎大声说。

“哦，你在这儿，是吗？”泰克尔顿应声说，“可怜的白痴！”

他真的认为她是个白痴，而且我不知道他是不是有意识的，这种想法就是以她喜欢他作为根据。

“嗯，既然在这儿——你好吗？”泰克尔顿不乐意地说。

“哦！好，很好。而且很快乐，正像你希望我的那样；正像你能办到的话，一定会给予全世界的那样的快乐。”

“可怜的白痴！”泰克尔顿咕哝着说，“一点不通人情，一点也不！”

盲女孩儿拿起他的手亲亲；又双手握了它一会儿，把她的面颊温柔地贴一会儿，才放开。这个举动里包含着那样不可言喻的感情和那样热烈的感激，连泰克尔顿也不免受到感动，用比平常柔和些的咆哮声说：

“这是怎么回事？”

“我昨天晚上睡觉的时候，把它紧紧挨在枕头边上放着，梦里都想起它来。天亮的时候，灿烂的红太阳——是红太阳吧，爸爸？”

“早晨和傍晚是红的，蓓莎。”可怜的凯莱布用焦虑的目光瞟着他的雇主说。

“红太阳升起来，那明亮的光线让我几乎怕自己在走动的时候让它碰着我；它照进来了，我就把那株小树转过来对着它，同时赞美上帝创造了这样美好的东西，并感谢你送了来使我快乐！”

“疯人院给打开啦！”泰克尔顿悄没声儿地说，“咱们马上就要用拘束衣和消声器[16]了。咱们快了！”

女儿讲话的时候，凯莱布两只手无力地勾在一起，茫然直视，好像真的拿不准（我相信他是真的）泰克尔顿究竟做过什么值得她感谢的事没有。在这当口，如果他有任意行动的自由，要他冒死踢那个玩具商，或者依据他的功绩对他下跪，两者择其一，我相信可能性是完全相等的。不过，凯莱布心里明白，是他自己的双手那样小心翼翼地把那一小株玫瑰捧回家来送给她的，也是他自己的嘴编造了无辜的谎话，为的是可以使女儿不至于怀疑他每天都做了许多、许许多多的牺牲，目的是要女儿更快乐些。

“蓓莎！”泰克尔顿暂时伪装出一点亲热的声调说，“到这儿来。”

“哦！我能一直走到你那儿！你不必引导我！”她答应说。

“蓓莎，我告诉你一个秘密好吗？”

“只要你愿意！”她急切地回答。

那黯然的脸变得多有神采！那侧耳倾听的头映照着多么明亮的光辉！

“那个叫小什么的惯坏了的孩子，那个皮瑞宾格尔的太太，定期来拜访你们——在这里进行她的奇妙的聚餐，今天就是这样的日子，对不对？”泰克尔顿说，语气中表示对这整个事情极为鄙视。

“对啦，”蓓莎回答，“今天就是这样的日子。”

“我说是的嘛，”泰克尔顿说，“我愿意加入这个聚会。”

“爸爸，你听见了吗！”盲女孩儿叫着，兴奋得不得了。

“是的，是的，我听见了，”凯莱布喃喃地说，眼睛直愣愣的，像个梦游人，“不过我不信。我毫不怀疑这又是我的一个谎。”

“你知道，我——我打算使皮瑞宾格尔夫妇跟梅·费尔丁更亲密些，”泰克尔顿说，“我要和梅结婚了。”

“结婚！”盲女孩儿从他面前倒退一步，喊着说。

“她真是一个十足的白痴，”泰克尔顿咕哝着说，“我怕她永远听不懂我的话。喂，蓓莎！结婚！教堂、牧师、教会书记、教区小吏、玻璃马车、大钟、早餐、喜庆蛋糕、礼品、猪肘子以及其他种种傻玩意儿。结婚，你知道；结婚。你可知道什么叫作结婚吗？”

“我知道，”盲女孩儿语气温和地回答，“我懂！”

“你懂吗？”泰克尔顿喃喃地说，“这可出乎我意料。好吧！我就是为了这个要来参加聚会，还要带梅和她的妈妈来。今天上午我要送一点什么来。一块冷羊腿，或者这一类可口的东西。你要我来吗？”

“要。”她回答。

她低着头，转过身子，交叉着双手，站在那里思索。

“我想你不会要，”泰克尔顿瞅着她咕哝着说，“因为看样子你已经把什么都忘记了。凯莱布！”

“我想，我敢说，我在这儿，”凯莱布想着，嘴里说，“先生！”

“你留意别叫她忘记我刚才跟她说的话。”

“她从来不会忘记，”凯莱布回答，“这是她不够聪明的很少几件事情中的一件。”

“谁都把自己的笨鹅看作天鹅，”玩具商耸耸肩膀说，“可怜虫啊！”

老格拉夫和泰克尔顿极其轻蔑地说了这句话后，走了出去。

蓓莎仍然待在原来的地方，想得出神。她垂头丧气，脸上失去了笑容，变得十分忧郁。她摇头，摇了三四次，好像在为什么记忆或者损失而悲愁；可是，她悲伤的心情又无以言表。

凯莱布把几匹马架到一辆货车上，办法很简单，就是把挽具钉在马的要害上。他这样工作了一些时候，蓓莎才走近他的工作台，在边上坐下来说：

“爸爸，我在黑暗里好生孤单。我要我的眼睛，我的那双宽容我、心甘情愿侍奉我的眼睛。”

“这就是你的眼睛，”凯莱布说，“一直在这儿哪。与其说是我的眼睛，不如说是你的，蓓莎，二十四小时之中的任何一个钟点都是你的。你要眼睛做什么呢，亲爱的？”

“把这屋子瞧个遍，爸爸。”

“好的，”凯莱布说，“我立刻照做了，蓓莎。”

“你说说这屋子。”

“跟平常一模一样嘛，”凯莱布说，“朴素，然而舒适得很。墙上花花绿绿的；盘子、碟子里都是漂亮的花儿；光闪闪的木头，都是梁木、镶板；这幢房屋整个儿都精致，讨人喜欢。这一切弄得这屋子可美了。”

蓓莎的双手摸得到的地方都是又精致又讨人喜欢的。但是凯莱布用幻想把它如此改造过的这间破烂老旧的小屋子里，却没有其他地方能说得上精致而又讨人喜欢。

“你穿着工作服不像你穿上那件漂亮的外套那样神气吧？”蓓莎摸着他说。

“不那么神气，”凯莱布回答，“可是相当轻便。”

“爸爸，”这盲姑娘挨近他，轻轻地搂着他的脖子说，“跟我说说梅的事情。她很好看吗？”

“她的确不错。”凯莱布说。她的确不错。凯莱布这次不必依靠虚构，这是不大有的事。

“她一头黑发，”蓓莎沉思着说，“比我的还黑。她的声音又甜又好听，我知道。我过去常常喜欢听。她的体形——”

“整个屋子里没有一个娃娃比得上她，”凯莱布说，“还有那一双眼睛！——”

他说不下去了；因为蓓莎搂得更紧，手臂在他脖子上一压，他太熟悉这种警告了。

他咳了一阵，敲打了一阵，然后唱起那首关于“闪光的大酒杯”的歌曲，那是他在这种困境中所能依靠的万无一失的应对办法。

“爸爸，我们的朋友，我们的恩人呢？你知道，我从来都不厌倦听听他的事情——我厌倦过没有呢？”她着急地说。

“当然没有，”凯莱布回答，“而且有充分理由。”

“啊！有多么充分的理由啊！”这个盲姑娘高声说，那样热情洋溢，凯莱布虽然动机纯洁无瑕，也都难以容忍自己去看她的脸，便朝地下看着，好像怕她从他眼睛里瞧出他的善意的欺骗。

“那么再跟我说说他吧，亲爱的爸爸，”蓓莎说，“再说许多次！他的脸是仁爱、宽厚、亲切的。诚恳而又忠实，肯定如此。一颗大丈夫的心想用一种粗暴和不心甘情愿的外表，去掩盖住一切厚意，反而在一顾一盼之间流露出来。”

“而且使它崇高。”凯莱布简直不顾一切地加了一句。

“而且使它崇高！”盲姑娘喊道，“他比梅年纪大，爸爸。”

“不错，”凯莱布勉强地说，“他比梅大一点。不过那没有多大关系。”

“哦，爸爸，不错！在他年老体弱的时候做他有耐心的伴侣；在他生病的时候做他温柔的护士；在他忧愁苦恼的时候做他忠实的朋友；不知疲倦地为他工作；照料他，伺候他；在他醒来的时候坐在他床边和他谈谈；他睡了，为他祈祷；这些事是多么光荣！这是证实她对他完全衷心爱戴的多好的机会！她会这样办吗，亲爱的爸爸？”

“毫无疑问。”凯莱布说。

“我爱她，爸爸，我能打心底里爱她！”盲姑娘嚷着说。一面说，一面把可怜的长着瞎眼的脸贴在凯莱布的肩膀上，哭成泪人儿似的，使得他差不多后悔把使人泪淋淋的幸福故事带给她了。

这时候，在约翰·皮瑞宾格尔的屋子里发生了相当大的骚动，因为小皮瑞宾格尔太太自然不能设想到什么地方去而不带着婴孩。带着婴孩来去，沉沉的，颇费周章。这并不是说婴孩有多大，而是说他作为一件东西，既有重量又有体积，那么就有一大堆事情要做，为他做，而且必须不慌不忙地做好。比如说，当你想尽办法把婴孩打扮到一定程度，你或许已经有充分的理由想到，再碰他那么一两下，就会把他整理好了，把他变成能向全世界挑战的顶呱呱的婴孩，却意想不到他戴着法兰绒帽子睡着了，得匆忙地将他抱到床上；在大半个钟头里，他在床上两条毛毯之间呼呼地睡着了（譬如这么说）。这一蛰伏不动的阶段过去之后，他光芒四射，吼声震天，就又被人召回去吃点——什么呢？如果你允许我笼统地说说，那我还是这样说的好——吃点小点心。吃过点心后，他又去睡觉了。皮瑞宾格尔太太利用这一间歇把自己稍稍打扮一下，就像你在一生中所看到的任何人那样，打扮得漂漂亮亮。同样在这个短暂的和平时期，施罗博埃小姐悄悄地穿上一件羊毛短上衣，其式样之新奇美妙，跟她，或者天下任何事物，都联系不起来；这上衣是皱拢的、边上卷起的，有种独立不倚的架势，它追寻着自己孤单的旅程，丝毫也不在意任何别人。这时候，婴孩竟然又活蹦乱跳起来了，皮瑞宾格尔太太和施罗博埃小姐共同努力把他穿戴停当，用一件奶油色的披风包着他的身体，用一顶本色布制的发酵的馅饼式帽子盖在他头上。于是过了一段时间，他们三人才下楼来到门口。那匹老马，由于用它急躁的“亲笔签名”把马路踏得一塌糊涂，已经从通行税托拉斯[17]拿回比它一天的通行税的全部款项还要多的钱了。在那边，可以模模糊糊地看见拳击手正在远处站着回望，引诱老马不要等待命令就跟上来。

说到那把椅子，或者任何这类帮助皮瑞宾格尔太太进入车厢中去的东西，要是你认为那东西是必需的话，那么你对约翰就很不了解了。你还没有看见约翰把她从地上举起来，她已经在她的位置上了，精神抖擞，面色红润，说道：“约翰！你真行！当心蒂蕾吧！”

要是允许我提到一位年轻女士的双腿，无论如何，我要观察施罗博埃的，有一桩不幸的事，使得那双腿特别容易被擦伤。不管是上去或下来一点点，她都从来没有不在腿上把情况用伤痕记录下来的，就像鲁滨孙·克鲁苏在他的木头日历上把日子记下来一样。不过提起这件事可能会被人认为没有礼貌，我当考虑及此。

“约翰，你可带了那一篮小牛肉和火腿馅饼了？还有别的东西，还有几瓶啤酒。”小不点儿说，“要是你没有带，你必须再回去一趟，立刻就去。”

“你是一位有趣的小人儿，”运货夫说，“已经叫我耽搁了整整一刻钟，还说什么再回去一趟。”

“对此我很抱歉，约翰，”小不点儿说，忙乱了好一阵子，“可是我不能想象——我无论如何也办不到，约翰——到蓓莎家里去而不带上小牛肉和火腿馅饼，以及别的东西，还有几瓶啤酒。跑！”

这个单音节的字是对着马儿喊的，可是它理也不理。

“哦，约翰，跑啊！”皮瑞宾格尔太太说，“请你叫它跑！”

“有的是时间起跑，”约翰回答，“我这会儿正着手安排一些行前的事情。篮子在这儿，够安全的。”

“你必定是个狠心肠的怪物，约翰，不肯马上说出来，省得我这样着急！我刚才声明我不能到蓓莎家里去而不带小牛肉和火腿馅饼，还有其他的东西，还有几瓶啤酒，不论你给我多少钱都不行。约翰，自从我们结婚以来，我们总是每两个星期到那儿去进行小小的聚餐。要是有什么搞得不对头，我几乎要认为我们再也不会走运了。”

“一开始那就是一个好主意，”运货夫说，“我为此而尊敬你，小妇人。”

“我亲爱的约翰，”小不点儿回答，脸涨得通红，“不要说什么尊敬我。我的天！”

“顺便说说——”运货夫说，“那位老绅士——”

又是那么明显的、立见颜色的困惑不安！

“他是一个奇怪的家伙，”运货夫说，直愣愣地望着他面前的那条马路，“我摸不透他。我不相信他会有什么不好吧。”

“完全没有。我——我敢担保完全没有。”

“是吗？”运货夫说，眼睛盯着她的脸瞧，被她那十分真挚的神态所吸引，“我很高兴你那么肯定，因为这对于我来说是进一步得到了证实。真稀奇，他竟然有那种想法，竟然要求允许他继续和我们住在一起。不是吗？事情发生得好奇怪啊。”

“太奇怪了。”她接口说，声音低低的，简直听都听不见。

“不管怎样，他是一位和蔼可亲的老绅士，”约翰说，“而且像绅士一样付账，我想他的话也像绅士一样靠得住。今天早晨我跟他谈了很久。他说，他对我的声音比较习惯了，已经能较好地听懂我的话。他把自己的事情跟我谈了很多，我也把自己的事跟他谈了很多，他还问了我一大堆问题。我告诉他我的行业路线有两条巡回线，你知道。一天从我们的房屋向右边去，再转回来。另外一天从我们的房屋向左边去，再转回来（因为他是一个陌生人，不知道这一带的地名）。他听了似乎很有兴味。‘啊，那么今儿晚上我要按照你那条路回家了，’他说，‘我刚才还以为你要从正好相反的方向过来呢。这多妙啊！或许我还要麻烦你让我乘你的车子，不过我要设法不再呼呼大睡。’可是他却呼呼大睡了，错不了！——小不点儿！你在想什么呀？”

“在想什么吗，约翰？我——我在听你说哪。”

“哦！很好！”诚实的运货夫说，“从你脸上的神情看起来，我怕我谈得太多，弄得你想其他的事情去了。我十分接近这一情况，我敢肯定。”

小不点儿不回答，短时间内，他们在沉默中驱马前进。可是，要在约翰·皮瑞宾格尔的车子里长时间保持沉默是不容易的，因为路上每个人都有话要跟他说。虽然也许只不过是“你好！”的确也常常不是其他什么话，然而，要一再用恰当的热诚的态度做出回答，需要的不仅仅是点点头，笑一笑，还需要有益于肺部健康的动作，就像长篇大论的议会演说那样。有时候，步行的或者骑马的过路人在马车旁跋涉，同走一小段路，就因为明显的想跟人聊聊天的目的。这样一来，双方就有许许多多的话要说了。

于是，拳击手带来的人们认识和理解运货夫的机会，比半打基督徒所能给的还要多！在这条路上，大家都认识它——特别是家禽和猪，一看见它走过来，斜侧着身子，过分好奇地竖起耳朵，那一根尾巴在空中乱摆，它们立刻撤退到远处后面的居留地去，而不为更接近的交往的荣誉而待在原地。它到处都有事干。跑到所有的转角去转转，跑到所有的井口去照照，在所有的茅屋里窜来窜去，冲到所有初等小学里，把所有的鸽子都吓得飞起来，使所有的猫尾巴都变得粗起来，并且像一位常客那样小跑着走进一家家酒店。不论它走到哪里都能听见张三或李四喊道：“哈！拳击手来啦！”话音刚落，就有人在至少两三位其他什么人的伴同下，立刻向约翰·皮瑞宾格尔和他的美丽的妻子请安问好。

这辆送货马车上大件小件的包裹堆积如山；沿途有不少耽搁，要把包裹放上去，取下来，这件事可一点也不是旅途的最坏部分。有些人对他们的邮包满怀着期望，有些人对他们的邮包满怀着好奇，还有些人对他们的邮包不停地关照，约翰对所有的邮包都怀有强烈的兴趣，整个场景就像一幕生动的情景剧。马车上还装有物件要运送，运送它们也需要思考和讨论，关于这些东西的调整和安排，运货夫和发送者还得进行多次会议讨论。这类会议，拳击手通常都参加，它短时间一阵隔一阵地极其聚精会神，可是又长时间一阵隔一阵地绕着聚集在一起的贤达之士飞奔，一圈又一圈，还汪汪直叫，把嗓子都叫哑了。对于这些小插曲，坐在马车里的小不点儿是个旁观者，她饶有兴味地全都看在眼里。她坐在那儿，观看着——马车的遮阳伞把她框成令人赞美的一幅妩媚的小肖像画——在年轻小伙子们中间少不得要用胳膊肘儿推推，眼睛瞟瞟，窃窃私语，艳羡不已。这一点，使得运货夫约翰高兴得无法形容；因为他为自己的小妻子被人羡慕而感到骄傲，同时知道她对此并不在意——还知道，要是有什么的话，她倒也很喜欢这样子呢。

正月的天气，旅途上固然有一点雾蒙蒙的，而且阴湿寒冷；可是有谁会在乎如此无关紧要的事情呢？小不点儿肯定不会。蒂蕾·施罗博埃也不会，因为她认为，不管怎样，坐在马车里是人类的幸福的极点，这马车是世上所希望的再好也没有的安乐窝。婴孩也不会，这点我可以发誓；因为一路上他都被裹得暖暖的，睡得香香的，婴孩在这两方面都有很大的需求量，没有哪个婴孩能比小皮瑞宾格尔更有福气。

当然，在迷雾里你不可能看得很远，然而你却能够看到很多呢！你只要不嫌麻烦去观察，就会感到惊讶，你竟然能够在比这更浓的迷雾里看见这么多东西啊！嗨，即使坐在田野里，瞧着一个个仙人圈[18]，以及残留在树篱笆边和林木下的阴影里的一块一块的白霜，也是一桩令人兴味盎然的事情哩。且不说那些意想不到的树影的样子了：杈丫从迷雾里弹出来，然后重又滑到迷雾之中去。树篱笆纠缠在一起，光秃秃的，在寒风里摇摆，好像无数枯萎的花环，不过看来并不令人意气消沉。沉思冥想是愉快的事情，因为它使得眼前的壁炉变得比原来暖和，又使得未来的夏天变得更为翠绿。河流看来阴冷得很，然而还在流着，而且流得很快，这是一个重大的要点。运河水流得相当迟滞缓慢，这一点必须承认。可是不必介意。等到霜雪恰到好处地开始降临的时候，运河立刻就会冰封起来，于是就会有人溜冰、滑雪什么的；一艘艘沉重的旧驳船就会被冻结在靠近码头的什么地方，生锈的铁烟囱烟斗整天吸着烟，吞云吐雾，懒散地消磨时光。

在某处，有一座巨大的野草或者麦茬遍布的山丘在燃烧着；他们瞧着在白天里烧得那么白热的火光，透过迷雾闪烁着，只有东一处西一处射出一道红光来。到后来，由于施罗博埃小姐看到熏烟“扑到她鼻子上来了”，她呛咳起来——只消有一点点刺激，她就会做出任何这一类的事情——而且把婴孩吵醒，不肯再睡觉了，他们这才不再看。然而拳击手跑到前面约有四分之一英里的地方，早已跑过了城市的前哨点，到达了凯莱布和他的女儿住的那条街的转角处；在他们来到门口以前，拳击手和那位盲女已经在人行道上等着迎接他们，等了好久。

顺便说说，拳击手在跟蓓莎打交道的时候，带着它自己特有的细心周到的样子，这使我完全相信它明白蓓莎是瞎眼的人。它从来不像常常对别人做的那样瞧着她来吸引她的注意，而是寸步不离地碰着她。我闹不清，它可能有过和盲人和盲狗相处的什么经验。但它从来没有跟瞎眼的主人待过；老拳击手先生、老拳击手太太以及他们父亲一边或者母亲一边的可尊敬的家系中的任何一位，也都没有患盲症的，这一点我是知道的。或许它是自己学会这一套的，不过它不知怎么的就已经能掌握得很好了；因此它紧挨着蓓莎的裙子，而且一直这样，直等到皮瑞宾格尔太太、婴孩、施罗博埃小姐，以及篮子，都安全地进了门为止。

梅·费尔丁已经先来了，她的妈妈也来了——她是一位动不动就发脾气的小老太太，一脸不高兴的样子。因为她继承而保有了像一根床柱那样细的腰，她的身段被认为是最出类拔萃的了。她还一度因为境遇比较好，或者因为她煞费苦心地给人一种印象，如果说有什么事情发生过而实际上并没有发生，而且似乎从来没有特别可能会发生——然而这是一回事——她可能一度境遇比较好，所以，她的确是非常有大家风度，气派十足。格拉夫和泰克尔顿也在那儿欣然迎候，带着明显的自在的样子，就像一条新鲜的小鲑鱼登上了大金字塔的顶上那样，毫无疑问是在他本行的范围之内。

“梅！我亲爱的老朋友！”小不点儿喊着，奔上前去迎接她，“看到你来多高兴啊！”

她的老朋友完全像她一样兴奋和欢喜；要是你相信我的话，看见她们拥抱在一起，真是叫人快活。毫无疑问，泰克尔顿是一个懂得风雅的人。梅则是非常漂亮。

你知道，你看惯了一张漂亮的脸蛋儿的时候，这张脸又和另外一张漂亮的脸碰在一起并且相比较的时候，有时候，原来那张漂亮的脸一下子似乎变得平常了，姿容减色了，难以符合你曾经对它的高度评价了。不过，现在的情况不论对于小不点儿或者对于梅来说，都完全不同；因为梅的脸陪衬着小不点儿的脸，小不点儿的脸又陪衬着梅的脸，如此自然，而且相得益彰。约翰·皮瑞宾格尔走进屋子里来的时候，几乎脱口而出，说她们应该生来是一对姐妹——这是你能够提出来的唯一的改进建议。

泰克尔顿带来了一只羊腿，此外，说来也真妙，还有一只果馅饼呢——不过事关我们的新娘子的时候，我们不会在意一点小小的花费；我们可不是每天都结婚的——除了这两样美味以外，还有小牛肉和火腿馅饼，以及皮瑞宾格尔太太所谓的“东西”：这主要是指硬壳果、橙子、薄饼，以及这一类的并不稀奇的东西。等到这些膳食陈列在案桌上，由凯莱布从侧面供应一只巨大的木碗，里边盛着热气腾腾的土豆（有一个庄严的合约禁止他送上任何其他的食品），这时候，泰克尔顿领着他的未来的丈母娘坐上荣誉的席位。为了在这高级的节日里，在这个地方，表现得更优美一些，这位威严庄重的老人家，在她自己的头上装饰了一顶帽子，打算这样来使得轻率的人产生一种敬畏的感情。她还戴着手套呢。不过让我们大家都彬彬有礼吧，否则还是死了的好！

凯莱布坐在他女儿旁边。小不点儿和她的老同学紧挨在一起。那位好运货夫则照顾着餐桌的末端。施罗博埃小姐一时之间孤立于一切家具之外，除了她坐的那把椅子，这样，她就可以不让其他的东西来碰婴孩的头了。

蒂蕾睁大眼睛对着那些娃娃和玩具东看西看的时候，它们则睁大眼睛看着她和来客。站在沿街的门口的可尊敬的玩偶老绅士们（他们全都精神抖擞）对于这次聚会感到很有兴趣。不时地跳跳又停停，好像正在听里边的谈话。然后，粗野地一次又一次闯进去，闯了许多次，而不停下来喘一口气——好像对这整个事情喜欢到发狂的程度。

如果这些玩偶绅士想要在泰克尔顿的窘境中得到一种恶意的快乐，那么他们当然有足够的理由得到满足。泰克尔顿跟他们完全合不来，他的未来的新娘子越是成为小不点儿的圈子里的人，感到兴高采烈，他越是不喜欢这种情况，虽然他是为了使她们愉快才把她们拉在一起的。因为他，泰克尔顿，是一个名副其实的“牛槽里的狗”[19]，她们大笑的时候，他却不能，于是他立刻想到，她们一定是在笑他。

“啊，梅！”小不点儿说，“亲爱的人儿，变化多大啊！聊聊那些快乐的学生时代的日子，使人又变得年轻起来了。”

“哦，你并不怎么老，一直是这样，是不是？”泰克尔顿说。

“瞧瞧我那位拖着稳重的步子的丈夫吧，”小不点儿说，“他至少使我增加二十岁，是不是，约翰？”

“增加四十岁。”约翰回答。

“你将会使梅增加多少，我肯定我不知道，”小不点儿笑着说，“不过她明年生日的时候，不可能离一百岁差得太远。”

“哈，哈！”泰克尔顿大声笑着。可是他的笑声像鼓声一样轰隆隆的。他看起来好像可以舒舒服服地把小不点儿的脖子拧过来。

“亲爱的、亲爱的人儿！”小不点儿说，“回想一下吧，我们在学生时代，常常谈到将来要选择什么样的丈夫。我不知道我的丈夫是多么不年轻，不漂亮，不动人，不活泼啊！至于梅的丈夫呢！——啊，天哪！我一想到我们曾经是多么傻的女孩子，我真不知道该笑还是该哭。”

梅却似乎知道该做什么，因为红晕泛到她的脸上来了，眼泪在她眼睛里转。

“即使那些人——真正生气勃勃的男青年本身——有时候被我们看中，”小不点儿说，“我们一点也没想过事情会怎样发展下去。我能肯定的是自己从来没有看中过约翰，我连想也没有想到过他。要是当时我跟你说，你以后要和泰克尔顿先生结婚，嗨，你会打我嘴巴子的。梅，是不是啊？”

虽然梅没有说是，但是她当然也没有说不是，或者用任何方式表示过不是。

泰克尔顿大笑着——他笑得那么响，简直是喊叫哪。约翰·皮瑞宾格尔也大笑，带着和蔼可亲、心满意足的态度，像他平常那样；不过，比起泰克尔顿的大笑来，他不过是一种耳语式的笑罢了。

“尽管如此，你们可由不得自己做主。你瞧，你们没法拒绝我们，”泰克尔顿说，“我们在这儿！我们在这儿！可是你们动人的年轻新郎现在在哪儿啦？”

“他们当中，有些人已经死了。”小不点儿说，“有些人已经被人遗忘了。有些人，要是能在此刻站在我们中间，会不相信我们和过去还是同一个人，会不相信他们所见和所闻是真的，而我们竟然把他们忘得一干二净。不！他们一点也不会相信！”

“嗨，小不点儿！”运货夫嚷起来，“你这小妇人！”

她的一番话说得那样诚挚，那样热情，毫无疑问，她有必要稍稍恢复一下精神。她的丈夫的阻拦是非常客气的，因为照他的打算，他干扰一下只不过是为了保护老泰克尔顿。然而此举证明有效，因为她住了口，不再说话了。即使在她的静默之中，也有一种不平常的激动。那个心细如发的泰克尔顿把他半闭着的眼睛瞄准着她，一一看在眼里，而且像你将会看到的那样，还相当成功地记在心里。

梅不吭声，好歹不说一个字，只是十分安静地坐着，眼睛朝下望，对于刚才种种事情表示不感兴趣。她的母亲，那位好夫人这会儿插了进来，开宗明义，说女孩子总是女孩子，过去的事总是过去的事，还说，只要是年轻而又轻率的年轻人，他们就有可能像年轻而又轻率的人那样行事。此外还发表了两三条同样带有正确无误和不可辩驳的特点的意见。然后，她带着一种虔敬的精神说，她感谢上帝，因为一直在她女儿梅的身上发现一颗恭敬和孝顺的孩子的心；虽然她有一切理由相信这完全是由于她的缘故，她却没有把这一点归功于自己。关于泰克尔顿先生，她说从道德的观点看来，是一位无可訾议的人；从合适的观点看来，没有一个神志清醒的人能怀疑他是一个合人心意的女婿。（她说到这里的时候特别加重语气。）关于这个在他三番五次恳求之后才接纳他的家庭，她相信泰克尔顿先生知道，这个家庭虽然钱包里空些，可是却具有一种貌似名门世家的气派。在某种不是完全没有关系的情况之下，她甚至会说靛青生意（但是她不打算再特别提到它）要是曾经顺手的话，那么这家庭也许已经占有了财富。然后她说不愿意提到过去，也不愿意说起她的女儿曾经拒绝过泰克尔顿先生的求婚，更不愿意啰啰唆唆地谈她谈过的许许多多其他的事情。最后，作为自己的观察和经验的总结，她宣布凡是不具备被浪漫地、愚蠢地称作爱情的婚姻，才往往是最幸福的婚姻；并且她从即将来临的那件婚事中，预见其得到最大量的幸福——不是那种欢天喜地的幸福，而是那种实实在在的、源源不绝的幸福。在结束她的话的时候，她对大伙儿说，她活到现在，是因为明天这个她特意盼望的日子；并且说，等过了明天，她就没有更大的希望了，只希望让人包裹起来，安排在任何体面的殡葬之地就行了。

这些话是很难回答的，一切远远达不到目的的话都有这种可喜的特性。正因如此，他们改变了话题，大家的注意力都转移到小牛肉和火腿馅饼、冷羊肉、土豆和果馅饼上来。约翰·皮瑞宾格尔为了使瓶装啤酒不至于被人忽视，他提议为明天大喜的日子干杯。他号召他们满满地喝一杯，然后他便继续登程赶路去了。

你应该知道他刚才不过是在那儿歇一歇脚，给那匹老马喂一些草料。他还得赶四五英里的路；等到傍晚的时候回到这里来接小不点儿，再歇一歇脚，然后回家。这是他们每一次聚餐会的一天的日程，自从他们立下这个规定以来，一直是这样。

对于刚才的祝福，除了新娘和被选中的新郎以外，还有两个在场的人只是冷淡地表示了敬意。其中一个是小不点儿，她太腼腆，局促不安，不能使自己适应此刻发生的任何小事情。另外一个是蓓莎，她在其余的人离开之前，匆忙地站起来，离开了餐桌。

“再见！”身强力壮的约翰·皮瑞宾格尔穿上厚呢大衣，说道，“我在老时间回来。跟大家再见！”

“再见，约翰。”凯莱布回答说。

他似乎是机械地说这句话，而且带着同样无意识的神情挥挥手。这是因为他站在那儿盯着蓓莎瞧，脸上那种心烦意乱、迷惑不解的表情，始终不变。

“再见，小家伙！”兴高采烈的运货夫说着弯身去吻吻孩子。这会儿正专心致志于她的刀叉的蒂蕾·施罗博埃，已经把这个孩子安置在（说来也怪，竟然毫无损伤）蓓莎置备的一个小摇篮里，让他睡着了。“再见！我的小朋友，我想不久以后，你就要跑到外面的寒风中去，留下你的老爸爸待在壁炉边上吸他的烟斗，生他的风湿病。嗯？小不点儿哪里去啦？”

“我在这儿呢，约翰！”她跳起来说。

“来吧，来吧！”运货夫响亮地拍着手说，“烟斗在哪儿？”

“我差不多把烟斗给忘了，约翰。”

把烟斗给忘了！从来也没有听到过这种奇怪的话！她呀！把烟斗给忘啦！

“我——我马上装板烟。立刻就装好。”

然而并不是立刻就装好的。烟斗躺在它经常待的地方——运货夫的厚呢大衣的口袋里，还有一个小烟草袋，那是她自己做的，她经常就是用这袋里的烟装烟斗。可是她的手抖得那么厉害，被那个袋子缠住了（不过，她的手很小，我肯定她可以容易地抽出来），搞得一塌糊涂。你应该记得，我曾经称赞过她在做装烟斗和点烟的这些小事务方面非常心灵手巧，可是这回从头到尾她都做得极其糟糕。在这整个过程中，泰克尔顿都站在那儿，半闭着眼睛，不怀好意地瞧着。每一次，他的眼光遇上她的眼光——或者说逮住她的眼光，因为很难说是遇上别人的眼光，他那样子就像一种逮住别人眼光的陷阱——极大地增加了她的窘迫。

“喂，今天下午你是一个多么笨手笨脚的小不点儿啊！”约翰说，“我的确相信，我自己来做，准会比你做得好！”

他说完这些善意的话以后，大步走开了。不久就听见他和拳击手、老马和车子一起一路上弄出的生气勃勃的音乐。这时候，在梦幻中的凯莱布仍然站在那儿，眼睛定定地瞅着他的盲女儿，他的脸上还是之前那样的表情。

“蓓莎！”凯莱布温和地喊她，“发生了什么事情啦？打从今天早上起——几个钟头里，你变得多么厉害啊，我的亲爱的人。你整天不言不语，闷闷不乐！这到底是怎么啦？告诉我吧！”

“哦，爸爸，爸爸！”盲女孩儿叫着，眼泪夺眶而出，“哦，我的好苦、好苦的命啊！”

凯莱布用手擦擦自己的眼睛，然后回答她的话。

“不过你想想你过去是多么幸福愉快啊，蓓莎！多么好，许多人又多么爱你啊。”

“就是那样我才受不了啊，亲爱的爸爸！总是那么关心我！总是待我那么好！”

凯莱布觉得非常困惑，不明白她的意思。

“变成——变成了瞎子，蓓莎，我的可怜的乖乖，”他结结巴巴地说，“是极大的不幸；不过——”

“我从来没有感到这一点！”盲女孩儿大声说。“我从来没有感到它是痛苦的全部。从来没有！我有时候希望自己能够看见你，或者能够看见他——只要看见一次，亲爱的爸爸，只要看见短短的一分钟——这样，我就可以知道我所热爱的，”她把双手放在胸前，“并且铭记在心里的人是什么样子！这样，我就可以肯定自己的想法完全正确！有时候（不过那时候我还是个孩子），我在晚上祈祷时哭泣，想到你们的形象有一天要从我的心中升到天堂里去，那时候，你们的形象可能不是你们自己真正的样子。不过，这些想法我从来没有想很久。都已经过去了，而我又心境平和，高高兴兴的了。”

“然而这些想法还会出现的。”凯莱布说。

“不过，爸爸！哦，我的和蔼的好爸爸，要是我不好，请你宽恕我吧！”盲女孩儿说，“使我心情这样沉重，愁闷不解的，并不是这件事情！”

她的爸爸湿漉漉的眼睛忍不住溢出泪水来。她是那么诚挚和可怜。但是他还是不了解她。

“把她带到我这儿来，”蓓莎说，“我不能把这件事情严严地藏在心里了。把她带到我这儿来吧，爸爸！”

她知道他踌躇不前，便说：“是梅。把梅带来！”

梅听见提到自己的名字，就静悄悄地向她走来，碰碰她的手臂。盲女孩儿立刻转过身子，用双手抱住她。

“瞧着我的脸吧，亲爱的宝贝，甜蜜的宝贝！”蓓莎说，“用你美丽的眼睛瞧着我，并且告诉我，诚实是不是写在我的脸上。”

“亲爱的蓓莎，是的！”

盲女孩儿仰着茫茫然的脸，眼泪扑簌簌地直往下掉。她仍然对着她说了下面这些话：

“在我的心灵里，没有一个祝愿或者思想不是为了你好，开朗的梅！在我的心灵里，没有一个令人感激的回想比那种深刻的记忆更强烈的了。那种记忆存留在我心里有许多许多时候了，那时候，你的目光和美丽都十分值得你为此自豪，但你却那么体恤瞎了眼睛的蓓莎，即使在我们两人都还是个孩子的时候就是这样了。或者说，即使在蓓莎是瞎得不能再瞎的孩子的时候，就是这样了！一切幸福降临到你的头上！光明照在你快乐的道路上！现在我对你的祝福丝毫未减，我亲爱的梅，”她更紧地抱住她，向她靠近，“我的小鸟，因为今天，知道你就要成为他的妻子，这件事绞得我的心几乎都要碎了！父亲啊，梅啊，玛丽啊！哦，原谅我这副样子，看在他为了减轻我黑暗生活的苦恼所做的一切的分上；也看在你们相信我的分上，你们相信我能呼唤上天来证实，对于善良的他，我不能希望他找到更相配的妻子了！”

她一边说，一边放开了梅·费尔丁的双手，带着一种恳求和爱慕交加的样子抓住她的衣服。她在做着奇怪的自白的时候，渐渐往下沉，最后跌坐在她的朋友的脚旁，把目盲的脸藏在她的衣服的褶皱之中。

“我的天哪！”她的父亲喊道，他被她吐露的真情当头打了一棒，“难道我不是从她睡在摇篮里的时候起，就欺骗了她，终于使她的心破碎了吗？”

那位小不点儿，那位喜洋洋的、能干而忙碌的小不点儿——她正是这样，不论她有什么缺点，也不管你可能适时地学会讨厌她——对于大家都好，我是说，她在那儿，这对于他们大家都是好事，否则就很难说这情形怎么结束了。在梅还不能回答、凯莱布还不能开口之前，小不点儿却已经恢复了往日的沉着冷静，插进来说话。

“来吧，来吧，亲爱的蓓莎！跟我来吧！梅，你去搀扶她一把。行啦！你瞧她已经多么平静了。她这样听从我们又是多么好，”这位活泼愉快的小女人说着，吻了蓓莎的前额，“来吧，亲爱的蓓莎！来吧，她的好爸爸在这儿，他会和她一起来的；是吗，凯莱布？当——然——啦！”

得，得！在这类事情上，她是一位高尚的小不点儿，必须是一个顽固不化的人才能抵抗她的影响力。她把可怜的凯莱布和他的蓓莎送走了，好让他们彼此安慰和劝解对方，她知道只有他们自己才能做到。于是，她立刻蹦了回来——俗话说，像一朵雏菊那么鲜艳；我却要说她更鲜艳——她蹦回来护卫那位戴着帽子和手套的昂首傲视的重要而矮小的人物，不让这位亲爱的老人家发现什么异常之事。

“那么把宝贝婴孩抱给我吧，蒂蕾，”她说，同时将一把椅子拖到壁炉边，“等我把孩子放在膝盖上的时候，蒂蕾，这位费尔丁太太将会把所有的育儿知识告诉我，并且改正我所触犯的二十个错尽错绝的地方。是不是呢，费尔丁太太？”

按照一般的说法，威尔士巨怪[20]模仿他的宿敌在吃早餐时耍的把戏，为他自己做了致命的外科手术，即使是这时候也不那么“迟钝”；即使是他，跌进为他准备的“陷阱”里的时候，也没有像这位老太太那样欣然就范地跌进这个巧妙的“陷坑”里边，一半也没有。泰克尔顿走了出去这件事，以及另外两三个人在一段距离之外交谈了两分钟，而把她抛在一边这件事，足够使她在二十四小时之内大摆架子，并且感叹那笔靛青生意所遭到的神秘的灾难。然而，在那位年轻的妈妈这方面，刚才对于她的经验所表示的恰如其分的敬意是如此不可抗拒，因此，在稍稍假装谦虚一阵以后，她就开始用世界上最宽厚的神态来教导她。老太太腰板笔直地坐在调皮的小不点儿跟前，谈了半个钟点的家庭食谱和格言，其准确无误的地方多于（如果照着做的话）会完全毁灭并且葬送那位小皮瑞宾格尔的地方，虽然他曾经是一位婴儿参孙[21]。

为了改变一下话题，小不点儿做了一点针线活儿——她把针线盒里的整套用品都放在她的口袋里。至于她是如何做到这一点的，我可不知道——然后她喂了一会儿奶；然后又做了一点针线活儿；然后，那位老太太在打瞌睡，小不点儿跟梅交头接耳谈了一会儿话。于是，像她一贯的作风那样，她匆匆忙忙地做了些琐琐碎碎的事情以后，发现下午过得真快。然后，因为天黑了，还因为按照这个聚餐会惯例中郑重其事的部分的规定，她必须做完蓓莎的所有家务，于是她把炉火调整好，把炉边扫干净，把茶盘摆出来，把窗帘拉上，把蜡烛点亮。然后，她在一架凯莱布替蓓莎制作的粗劣的竖琴上弹一两支曲子，弹得实在是好；因为造物主赐给了她精致的小耳朵，这耳朵能轻易鉴别出好的音乐，就像能甄别出上等珠宝一样，如果她有什么珠宝可戴的话。这时候，正是例行的吃茶点的时间；泰克尔顿又回来了，来共进晚餐，消磨黄昏。

凯莱布和蓓莎已经在前不久回来了，凯莱布已经坐下来做他下午的工作。可是他无法安下心来做，可怜的人啊，为了他的女儿正忧心忡忡，悔恨交加。他的样子看起来让人感动，那样意兴阑珊地坐在工作凳上，深情地瞧着女儿，脸上的表情似乎一直在说：“难道我不是从她在摇篮里的时候起，就欺骗了她，而使她的心破碎了吗？”

黑夜降临了，茶点用完了，小不点儿在洗茶杯和茶碟的工作方面已经没有更多的事情要做了；总之一句话——因为我必须说到这一点，要拖延也拖延不了——在时间接近于期待从远处响起那位运货夫回来的车轮的滚动的每一个声响的时候，她的神态又改变了；脸色一阵红，一阵白，显得颇为坐立不安。那可不像一些好妻子倾听着她们的丈夫回来的时候那样。不，不，不像。那是与此不同的另一种坐立不安。

听见了车轮声。还有一阵马蹄声，狗的吠叫声。所有的声音都渐渐逼近了。拳击手的脚爪在门上抓了！

“那是谁的脚步声！”蓓莎惊跳起来，喊着。

“谁的脚步声？”运货夫站在门口回答，他的褐色的脸，被夜里刺骨的寒风吹得像冬天的浆果那样红，“怎么啦，是我的啊。”

“我说的是另外的脚步声，”蓓莎说，“在你后面那个人的脚步声！”

“她可不会受骗，”运货夫笑着说，“来吧，先生。你是受欢迎的，不要害怕！”

他提高嗓门说话，他说着的时候，那位耳聋的老绅士进来了。

“凯莱布，他可不是你一次也没有看见过的生客，”运货夫说，“你会接待他，直到我们离开的时候吧？”

“哦，当然啦，约翰。这样做，我感到十分荣幸。”

“要是有秘密需要倾诉的话，他可是世界上最好的人选了，”约翰说，“我跟你说吧，我的肺部相当好，可是他考验着我的肺。请坐下，先生。朋友们都在这儿，大家高兴见到你！”

他做出了这一保证，他的嗓音充分证明他所说的自己的肺部的情况，说完之后，他又用本来的声调继续说：“他所需要的，不过是在壁炉边上放一把椅子，让他安安静静地坐着，自得其乐地东张西望。他是很容易满足的。”

蓓莎注意地倾听着。凯莱布放好了椅子以后，她便把他叫到身边，压低着声音要求他讲一讲客人的样子。他对她说了（这一回是真的了，说得丝毫不差），自从他进来以后，她头一次挪动身子，叹了口气，似乎对他没有更多的兴趣了。

运货夫兴致勃勃，他是一个好人，他比以前更喜欢他的小妻子了。

“今天下午，她真是个笨手笨脚的小不点儿！”他说着用一只粗糙的手臂去搂抱她，她离开其余的人站在那儿，“可是我不知怎么却喜欢她。小不点儿，瞧那边！”

他指着那位老人。她眼睛朝下看，我想她是发抖了。

“他是——哈，哈，哈！——他对你是十分钦佩的！”运货夫说，“到这儿来的一路上，什么旁的话都没有谈。嗨，他可真是一位勇敢的老孩子。我就喜欢他这一点！”

“约翰，我倒希望他有更好的话题。”她说，神色不安地打量着这间屋子，特别是打量着泰克尔顿。

“更好的话题！”喜滋滋的约翰大声说，“可没有这种东西。来吧！脱下大衣，脱下厚围巾，脱下一重重沉重的外皮吧！在炉火边舒舒服服地待半个钟头！太太，甘愿为你效劳。你和我来一场王牌游戏[22]怎么样？这可叫人乐着呢。小不点儿，把扑克牌和记分板拿来。要是啤酒还有剩余的话，再带一杯来，小妻子！”

他是对那位老太太下的战书，老太太立刻欣然接受了，他们很快打起扑克牌来。起初，运货夫有时候还带着微笑东张西望，或者不时地叫小不点儿从他的肩膀上望他手上的牌替他在某个难题上出出主意。然而，他的对手是一位严格遵守纪律的人，不过偶尔也会犯一种毛病，即用木钉记上比她有权利得到的更多的分数，这就需要他高度警惕，不能让眼睛或者耳朵闲下来。也因此，他的全部注意力逐渐集中在了扑克牌上面，别的什么也不想，直到一只手放在他的肩膀上，才使他清醒，认出了泰克尔顿。

“我很抱歉打扰了你——只消一句话，马上好。”

“我就要发牌了，”运货夫说，“正在紧要关头。”

“说得不错，”泰克尔顿说，“到这儿来吧，先生！”

他苍白的脸上的那种表情使得对方立刻站起来，匆匆忙忙地追问那是怎么回事。

“别出声！约翰·皮瑞宾格尔，”泰克尔顿说，“这件事情我很抱歉，的确抱歉。我曾经担心这件事，从一开始我就怀疑过。”

“什么事呢？”运货夫说，神色紧张。

“别出声！你只要跟我来，我指给你看。”

运货夫一声不吭地跟着他。他们穿过一个星光照耀着的院子，走过一扇小边门，进了泰克尔顿自己的账房里，那儿有一扇玻璃窗，看得见在夜里关闭着的那间商品储藏室。账房里没有灯光，但是狭长的商品储藏室里却亮着灯，因此玻璃窗是亮的。

“等一会儿！”泰克尔顿说，“你觉得自己能够受得了从窗口望进去吗？”

“为什么不行？”运货夫回答。

“再等一会儿，”泰克尔顿说，“决不能用暴力。那是没有用的，而且还有危险。你是一个烈性子的人，可能连你自己都来不及知道就已经动手杀了人。”

运货夫盯着他的脸看，然后好像被人打了一下似的倒退一步。他又一个箭步跨到窗前，只见……

哦，炉边的阴影啊！哦，忠实的蟋蟀啊！哦，不贞的妻子啊！

他看见了她跟那个老头儿在一起。他不再是老人了，而是腰背挺直，仪表堂堂，手上拿着那副假白发，他就是靠这个混进了他们的寂寞凄凉的家。他看见他低着头对她悄悄耳语，她则注意倾听着。她让他搂着她的腰，两人慢慢地沿着昏暗的木走廊朝着他们刚才进来的那扇门走去。他看见他们站住了，她转过身来——把那张脸，他深爱的那张脸，如此呈现在他眼前！——看见她亲手替他端正好他头上的欺骗人的东西，她一面做，一面取笑着他的并不叫人怀疑的本来面目！

起初，他强壮的右手紧紧攥着，仿佛要打倒一头狮子。然而立刻又松开了，伸展在泰克尔顿的眼前（因为即使在那时候，他对她还是很温柔），一直到他们走了出去的时候，他才像一个婴孩一样软弱地瘫倒在一张写字桌上。

等到她走进这间屋子的时候，他已经穿戴得严严实实的，连自己的下巴颏儿都裹上了，忙着备马、收拾包裹，准备回家了。

“好了，约翰，亲爱的！晚安，梅！再见，蓓莎！”

她还能吻别他们吗？在她离开的时候，她还能轻松愉快吗？她还胆敢在他们面前露脸而不害臊吗？是的。泰克尔顿仔细地观察她。她全都办到了。

蒂蕾正在哄婴孩睡觉。她在泰克尔顿跟前走过来走过去，走了十几次，迷迷糊糊地重复着说：

“那么，是它知道它要做它的一些妻子了，使它的心痛得差不多要碎了；是打它在一些摇篮里的时候起，它的一些爸爸就欺骗了它，到头来使它的一些心碎了！”

“蒂蕾，这会儿把宝宝给我吧。晚安，泰克尔顿先生。我的老天爷，约翰到哪儿去了？”

“他打算牵着马在一边步行。”泰克尔顿说，他帮她坐进了马车。

“我亲爱的约翰。步行吗？今天晚上？”

她那包裹得严严实实的丈夫匆匆地向她做了个肯定的表示。那位伪装的陌生人和那位小保姆都各就各位以后，那匹老马出发了。拳击手，这个不自觉的拳击手，一会儿跑在前面，一会儿跑到后面，一会儿绕着马车一圈圈地跑，并且像它一贯的那样耀武扬威、欢天喜地地吠叫着。

在泰克尔顿也护送梅和她的妈妈回家去的时候，可怜的凯莱布傍着女儿在炉火边坐下来，心中感到忧虑和悔恨，仍然用他深情的目光凝视着她，嘴里说着：“打她在摇篮里的时候起，我就欺骗了她，到头来却使她心碎了！”

为了逗那个婴孩玩儿，开动了的一些玩具，现在都早已停止不动了。在这微弱的灯光和一片寂静里，那些无动于衷的安静的洋娃娃、长着老大的眼睛和张着鼻孔的急躁的摇木马、用无力的膝盖和脚踝半弯着身子站在沿街的门边的老头儿、面目狰狞的胡桃夹子，以及好像寄宿学校学生外出散步时那样成双成对地朝方舟走去的野兽，都会令人猜想它们是一下子惊呆了，一动也不动，而这是由于它们不管在哪一种错综复杂的场合下，看到了小不点儿虚伪或者泰克尔顿竟然也有人爱，都会因此而觉得奇怪得不可思议的。





第三声


运货夫在他家的壁炉前坐下来的时候，墙角上的那只荷兰时钟敲了十点钟。他烦恼不堪，悲伤逾恒，似乎让那只杜鹃都吓了一跳，使得它尽可能短促地做完乐音袅袅的报时后，立即钻回它的摩尔式宫殿，把小小的门砰的一声关上，仿佛这罕见的景象让它在感情上受不了。

要是那个制作干草的小人儿手持最快的长柄镰刀作为武器，一下下地割到运货夫的心里去，也绝不会像小不点儿那样将他的心割得那么深，伤得那么狠。

那颗心充满了对她的爱；那颗心被数不清的千万缕迷人的回忆的线紧紧缠绕着，那些线是由她那出于可爱的品性的日常行为所纺成的；她把她自己那么温柔地、那么亲昵地珍藏在那颗心里；那颗心对真理是那么单纯，那么热切；对正义是那样坚定，对邪恶却是那样无力，因而起先那颗心中既没有愤怒，也没有报复的情感，只有容纳那形象已经支离破碎的它的偶像的空间。当运货夫在壁炉前坐下，在那儿沉思的时候，壁炉已经冰冷漆黑，其他更可怕的思想开始在他心中涌现，宛如夜间刮起的一阵狂风。那个生客在这个被糟践了的他的家里，只消跨三步就可以到达他的卧室门前，只消一拳就可以把房门敲开。泰克尔顿刚才说过“可能连你自己都来不及知道就已经动手杀了人”。如果他让这个流氓有时间跟自己肉搏，那怎么可以算是杀害他！更何况他还比自己年轻。

在这会儿动这个脑筋可不是时候，对于他阴郁的心境是有害的。如果狂怒的思潮，刺激他采取了报复的行动，会把这个欢乐的房屋变成孤单的旅客在夜间害怕路过的凶宅。在朦胧的月光下，胆怯的人会透过破窗子看见互相搏斗的人影。在暴风骤雨中，他们会听见阵阵喧闹声。

他比自己年轻！没错儿，准没错儿，是一个已经赢得了那颗他自己根本就没有触动过的芳心的情人，是一个她从前所选择的情人，她对他魂牵梦萦，她为他衣宽人瘦。而在这种时候，他却以为妻子在自己身旁觉得很幸福呢。哦，思及此，令人悲恸欲绝。

她一直都在楼上哄孩子睡觉。他在炉前坐着沉思的时候，她走近他的身边，把她常坐的小凳子放到他的脚旁，他却一无所知，因为他正经受着极大的苦痛的煎熬，什么声响也听不见。她把手按在他的手上，他这才知道她的到来，她正仰着头仔细地瞧着他的脸。

她是带着惊讶的神情望着他吗？不是。这仅是第一眼的印象，他不得不再看她一眼，确定一下。不，不是惊讶，是一种热切的询问的目光，可不是惊讶。起先那目光惶恐而严肃，过后又似乎因为看出他的心思而转变成一种奇怪的狂妄的骇人的微笑，接着只见她低下头来，十指交叉着按在额头上，头发披垂下来。

虽然此刻万能之神的神力可以听任他来支配，可是由于他的内心充满着强烈的慈悲的神性，他连鼓起轻如鸿毛的一丝力量来反对她都做不到。他过去常常满怀深情地、自豪地望着她那样天真快乐地弯腰坐在那张小凳子上，可是这会儿他却受不了。所以，她站起身来离开了他，一边走一边啜泣，她在他身旁一向占有的位置如今也空着了，然而这反倒使他感到轻松。然而这情况本身却比其他一切都更加让他感到痛苦。这提醒他，如今自己变得多么孤独了；这提醒他，如今自己生命中重要的联系是怎样给扯断了。

这种感觉越是强烈，他越是感到自己宁可忍受看见她怀抱着他们的婴孩，年纪轻轻就死在他的眼前。他对他的情敌越来越怒不可遏。他向四下里张望，寻找武器。

有一支枪挂在墙上，他取了下来，朝那个背信弃义的生客的房门走了一两步。他知道枪膛里有子弹。他产生了一个模糊的念头，使他认为把这个人当作畜生似的射死是无可非议的。这个念头在他心中不断膨胀，变成一个巨魔，整个儿控制了他，驱走了所有的比较温和的念头，在那儿建立了它那一统天下的王国。

这话说错了，并非驱走了所有的比较温和的念头，而是巧妙地把它们改变了，把它们变成了驱赶他向前的鞭子。变水为血，变爱为恨，变温柔为鲁莽的凶残。她那伤透了心的低声下气的形象，依然以一种无可抗拒的力量唤起他的善良和怜悯，那形象始终没有离开他的脑海；可是那形象逗留在那儿，却催促他走到房门前，把那武器举到肩膀上，还使他鼓起勇气，让他的手指扣住扳机，大声喊道：“杀死他！趁他在床上杀死他！”

他把枪掉转过来，准备用枪托击门。他把枪举到空中了，一个模糊的念头来到他的脑海，他想向那人叫喊，让他看在上帝的分上，快快越窗逃走——

这时候，挣扎着的炉火的余烬突然发出红光，把整个壁炉照亮了；炉边的蟋蟀啾啾啾，又开始唱起来了。

他所听到过的声音中，没有一个人的声音，哪怕是她的声音，都不能像这只蟋蟀的声音这样感动他，这样使他的心软下来。她把她对这只蟋蟀的喜爱告诉他的时候所用的淳朴的语言，他又一次听见了；她当时那副颤抖着的、真挚的姿态又出现在他的眼前；她那愉快的嗓音，那给一个诚实的人的炉边奏出家庭音乐的嗓音是多么动人啊！那嗓音这会儿一阵又一阵地使他的较为善良一面的天性发抖，把它唤醒，使它复苏，而且发挥了作用。

他从房门前退了回来，像一个梦游者从一场噩梦中醒过来似的，接着他把那支枪搁在一边。然后他又在壁炉前坐下，双手十指交叉蒙着脸，呜咽起来，借着泪水排遣他的苦痛。

炉边的那只蟋蟀一跳一跳地来到了屋子里，以一个小仙子的影像站在他的面前。

“‘我爱它，’”这小仙子的声音说着，重复一遍他记得很清楚的话，“‘因为它的鸣唱我听过许多次，它的没有恶意的音乐曾经引起我许多遐想。’”

“她是这么说的！”运货夫嚷了起来，“的确是这样！”

“‘约翰，我们这个家一直是幸福的，我为此爱这只蟋蟀！’”

“老天知道，这个家一直是幸福的，”运货夫答道，“过去她使这个家幸福，总是这样的——可现在不是这样了。”

“她是那么温和、优雅，那么贤惠，那么高高兴兴，那么忙个不停，又那么无忧无虑的！”那声音说。

“要不是那样，我怎么可能会像过去那样爱她。”运货夫答道。

那声音纠正他道：“像现在这样爱她。”

运货夫又说“像过去那样爱她”。不过语气已经不那么坚决了。他那颤抖的舌头反抗着约束它的力量，偏要一意孤行，为了它自己，也为了他。

那仙子用一种祈祷的姿势举起了手，说道：

“在你自己的壁炉边——”

“那个她摧残了的壁炉。”运货夫插嘴说。

“那个壁炉，她——经常！——祝福它和使它散发出光辉，”蟋蟀说，“如果没有她，那个壁炉只不过是几块石头、几块砖和几根生锈的炉栅而已，可是通过她，那个壁炉却变成了你家的祭坛了。在那祭坛上，你每天晚上都把一些无聊的情感、私心杂念或者忧虑作为祭品献上，还虔敬地献上平静的心、笃信的天性和洋溢的热情。因此，世界上所有的豪华的神殿里，那些最华丽的神龛前，燃烧着的最贵重的香火，都比不上从这个破旧的烟囱里往上冒的烟那样馥郁芬芳！在你自己的壁炉边，在它宁静的圣地中，被它温柔的影响和联想环绕着；听听她的嗓音！也听听我的嗓音！听听所有用你的壁炉和家庭的语言说话的东西的嗓音！”

“听那一切为她辩解的话吗？”运货夫问。

“凡是用你的壁炉和家庭的语言说话的东西都一定要为她辩解的！”蟋蟀答道，“因为它们说的是事情的真相。”

运货夫双手捧住脑袋，依然坐在椅子上想啊想的，那个精灵始终站在他身旁，借着它的力量激起他种种回忆，把那些往事像一面镜子或一张图画那样呈现在他的眼前。那个精灵并非孑然一身。因为还有许多小仙子成群结队地拥上来，他们来自炉砖里，来自烟囱里；来自那口钟、那个烟斗、那把水壶和那个摇篮里；来自地板、墙壁、天花板和楼梯里；来自屋子外面的那辆运货马车、屋子里的碗柜和种种日用家具里；来自她惯常接触的所有的东西和所有的地方，而这一切在她的闷闷不乐的丈夫心上缠住了对她的回忆。他们来自这一切。他们并不像蟋蟀那样待在运货夫身旁，而是忙忙碌碌地活动着，他们对小不点儿的影像表示无限尊敬。她的影像一出现，他们就扯他的衣襟，向那影像指指点点。他们把它团团围住，拥抱它，把花朵撒在地上让它踩着走；用他们的小手给它美丽的头戴上花冠。他们表示喜欢它，疼爱它，还表示除了爱嬉戏的和赞美她的他们自己之外，没有一个丑陋邪恶的或者兴师问罪的人有权利认识它。

他的心里总是萦绕着她的影像。那影像总是逗留在那儿。

她坐在炉前，一边忙着针线活儿，一边曼声低哼着歌儿。多么欢乐的、生气蓬勃的、稳健的小不点儿啊！这时候，小仙子们突然不约而同，全都转身向着他，全都睁大着眼睛凝神盯住他。他们仿佛对他说：“难道这个人是你因之而悲痛的轻浮的妻子吗？”

屋外传来一阵欢腾声：乐器在奏着乐，人们喧闹着，哄笑着。一群笑笑闹闹的年轻人拥进了屋子，其中有梅·费尔丁和二十个美丽的姑娘。小不点儿是她们中间最美丽的一个，然而和她们同样年轻。他们来约她去参加聚会。那是一个舞会。如果有哪双纤小的脚是为了跳舞而生的，那么无疑就是她的脚。可是她却笑了笑，摇摇头，朝炉火上煮着的食物指了指，又朝已经铺好了的餐桌指了指，态度淡漠而又极其欢乐，使她显得比以往更妩媚了。她就这样快快活活地把他们打发走了。当他们从她的身边走出去的时候，她向那些本来可能充当她的舞伴的小伙子一一点了点头，带着一种诙谐的冷漠神情。如果小伙子们是爱慕着她的话，她那种神情就足以使他们立刻投河自尽了——可是他们必定多少都曾经爱慕过她，他们实在也没有办法不爱慕她呀！然而冷漠无情却并非她的本性。啊，绝不是！因为不一会儿的工夫，有一个运货夫来到了门前。哎呀，她是多么热情地迎接了他呀！

这时候那些睁大着眼睛的小仙子又同时都朝他转过身来，而且仿佛在说：“难道她是抛弃了你的妻子吗？”

一个黑影落到那面镜子或者是那张图画上，随你把它称作什么都行。那是那个生客的巨大的黑影，那模样就跟他初次站在他们的屋顶下的时候一样。那黑影遮住了镜面，把其他所有影像都遮蔽了。可是那些敏捷的小仙子像蜜蜂似的忙个不停，又把那个黑影抹得干干净净了。小不点儿又出现在那儿了，仍然快快活活，十分美丽。

她正摇着摇篮，里面躺着她的小宝宝，她对他轻声唱着歌；她把头倚在一个人的肩膀上，这个肩膀是属于那个身旁站着蟋蟀仙子的、沉思着的人。

这时，夜渐渐深了——我指的是真实的夜，并非由仙子的时钟报时的夜。就在运货夫想到这儿的时候，月亮突然穿云而出，在夜空中明亮地照耀着。也许这时在他的脑海中也闪现出了一道宁静的光，使他能更冷静地想一想所发生的事。

虽然那个生客的影子仍然不时地落到那面镜子上，而且总是那么清晰、巨大、轮廓分明，不过再也不像先前那么乌黑了。那个黑影一出现，小仙子们便惊慌失措，异口同声地嚷起来，小小的手和脚忙成一团，瞬间把那个黑影抹掉了，敏捷得令人难以置信。只要他们又得到小不点儿，他们就把快活美丽的小不点儿指给他看，并在一边极其激动地欢呼着。

他们从不让她显现得既不美丽又不愉快，因为他们既然是家宅之神，虚假对他们来说是一种毁灭。因此，在他们看来，小不点儿除了是一个兢兢业业、欢天喜地的愉快的小人儿，是运货夫家中的光辉和太阳之外，还可能是什么呢？

当小仙子们又使小不点儿出现在一群贤明的老保姆之中的时候，他们又极其兴奋起来了。只见她怀抱着小宝宝，跟老保姆们聊着天，装出一副老态龙钟的、安详的神态，又沉静，又古板老迈，靠在她的丈夫的臂弯里。而且她自己才是那么点儿年纪的小妇人家，就想让人家认为她已经看破红尘，并且是一个对她来说做母亲根本不是什么新奇事儿的人。然而同时呢，他们又使她显现出正在哧哧地暗笑丈夫的笨拙，而为了使他显得潇洒，正在把他的衬衫领子往上拉扯，并且就在这屋子里兴高采烈地、装模作样地教他跳舞。

当他们把小不点儿和那个盲女孩儿一同显现出来的时候，他们又转过身来睁大眼睛狠狠地盯着运货夫，因为虽然她给所到之处全都带来了欢乐和生气，而她带到凯莱布·普卢默家来的却是更多的欢乐和生气。盲女孩儿爱她，信任她，感激她。她那种匆匆辞谢蓓莎的感谢的委婉态度；她利用访问的全部时间帮助这个家做着各种事情的那种小小的技巧——实际上拼命做着事情，却装出在玩乐的样子；她每次总是带来那么丰富的美味佳肴，又是小牛肉又是火腿馅饼的，还有啤酒；她来到他们家和离去的时候在门口显露的容光焕发的小脸蛋儿；她因为成为这个家的一分子而从她脸上所流露的奇异的表情，从她整洁的脚到她的头顶——而她又是这个家所不可或缺的，所非有不可的；所有这一切都是小仙子们所喜爱的，他们也因为这一切而爱她。于是他们又突然全都用恳求的眼光盯着他看，仿佛对他说：“难道她是对你背信弃义的妻子吗？”有些小仙子挨着她的衣服爱抚她。

在这漫长的夜晚，他心烦意乱，小仙子们不止一次、两次或三次，一再让他看见她坐在她喜欢坐的那张小凳子上，低着头，手指交叉着按在额上，头发披垂下来。他最后见到她的时候，她就是这个样儿。小仙子们每逢见到她这个样子，就不朝运货夫转过身去，也不朝他看，他们紧紧围着她，安慰她，吻她，挤在一块儿向她表示同情和友爱，把运货夫完全给忘了。

这个夜晚就这么过去了。月亮下去了，星光黯淡了，寒冷的拂晓带来了旭日。运货夫仍然坐在壁炉角落里沉思着。他双手支着头，在那儿已经坐了一整夜。通宵达旦，那只蟋蟀在炉边不停地唱着，啾啾啾，啾啾啾。通宵达旦，他听着。通宵达旦，那些家宅的仙子忙着跟他打交道。通宵达旦，除了那个黑影落到镜面上的时候，小不点儿在镜子里始终显得亲切可爱，无可指责。

天大亮了，他站起身来，漱洗完毕，穿好衣服。他再也不能兴致勃勃地着手做他的日常工作了，那是需要劲头的。不过这倒没有什么关系，因为这一天是泰克尔顿的结婚大喜的日子，他已经请人代他工作了。他原来打算和小不点儿快快活活地到教堂里去的。可是这个计划已经告吹了。这一天也是他们自己的结婚纪念日。唉！他怎么也想不到一年来竟然落得个这样的下场！

运货夫原本料想泰克尔顿会一早来到他家，果然不出所料，他在家门前来来回回还没有踱上几分钟，便瞧见那个玩具商坐着轻便马车一路过来了。马车走近的时候，他看见泰克尔顿为了结婚打扮得漂漂亮亮的，把那匹马的头也大大装饰了一番，又是花朵，又是彩球的。

跟泰克尔顿相比，那匹马倒更像是新郎了；他的那只半闭着眼睛的神情叫人看了比往常更讨厌。可是运货夫却没有注意到这一情况，他正在想着其他的事。

“约翰·皮瑞宾格尔！”泰克尔顿带着一种慰问的态度喊道，“我的老朋友，今天早晨你可好哇？”

“泰克尔顿先生，昨儿一整夜我可苦透了，”运货夫摇摇头说，“因为我心乱如麻。不过现在已经好了！你能匀出半小时左右，让我跟你私下里谈谈吗？”

“我是特地到你这儿来的，”泰克尔顿边回答边下了车，“不必管那匹马。你只消给它一点儿干草，把缰绳拴在这根柱子上，它就会安安静静地站着的。”

运货夫从马厩里拿来了干草，扔在马的脚前，接着他们俩就进了屋子。

“你的婚礼不是在上午举行吗？”运货夫问。

“不是，”泰克尔顿回答道，“时间多着呢，时间多着呢。”

他们走进厨房的时候，蒂蕾·施罗博埃正在乒乒乓乓地使劲敲着那个生客的房门，那扇门距离厨房只有几步路。她的一只红肿的眼睛贴在房门的锁孔上（蒂蕾由于她的女主人哭了，自己也哭了一整夜）。她把门敲得震天响，样子似乎有点害怕了。

“我这样敲，却没人听得见，”蒂蕾看了看四周说道，“我希望可不要有什么人走了，可千万不要有什么人死啦！”

施罗博埃小姐为了强调这一仁慈的愿望，又对着房门大敲大踢起来，可是什么结果也没有。

“要我去看看吗？”泰克尔顿说，“这事情可怪啦。”

从那扇门转开脸去的运货夫这时候向他使个眼色，表示他要是愿意去就好了。

于是泰克尔顿就去给施罗博埃小姐帮忙，也是又踢又敲了起来，然而也是得不到丝毫回应。不过他却想试试门把手，谁知“呀”的一声，门竟然给打开了，他先是探头窥视了一下，接着又定睛注视了一番，然后便跨进屋子里去，不一会儿工夫却又奔了出来。

“约翰·皮瑞宾格尔，”泰克尔顿凑在他的耳边说，“我希望昨晚没有出什么事情——没有发生什么莽撞的事情吧。”

运货夫猛然向他转过身去。

“因为他不在啦！”泰克尔顿说，“窗子却开着。我看不出有什么痕迹——的确，窗子跟花园的地面差不多高，我原来担心会发生——发生一场斗殴。呃？”

他几乎把他那只富于表情的眼睛全闭上了，他紧紧盯着运货夫看。他那只眼睛，他的脸，他的整个身体，全都猛烈地扭动一下，好像恨不得要从运货夫身上把事情真相拧出来似的。

“你放心吧，”运货夫说，“昨晚我既没有骂他也没有打他。他就进了屋子，从那以后谁也没有进去过。所以他完全是自愿走的。如果我能把过去改变，好像他从来没有来过那样，那么就是让我离家一辈子，挨家挨户讨饭，我也愿意。可是他来过了，又走了。所以我跟他已经什么关系也没有了！”

“啊！——我可认为他溜得太轻松了。”泰克尔顿拉过一把椅子坐了下来，说道。

运货夫对这句讥诮他的话没有领会，他也坐了下来，伸出一只手把脸遮住一会儿，然后才继续说。

“你昨天晚上让我看见，”他终于说了，“让我看见我的妻子——我心爱的妻子——秘密地——”

“而且温柔地。”泰克尔顿暗暗提示。

“假装看不出那人的化装，找机会让他和自己幽会。我所不愿意看到的景象，我想再也没有超过这个的了。我所不愿意看到的人，在这个世界上再也没有谁胜过让我看到那种景象的人了。”

“我承认自己一向是多疑的，”泰克尔顿说，“我也知道这一点使我在这儿惹人讨厌。”

“可是既然你让我看到了那种景象，”运货夫不理睬他的话，只顾继续说下去，“既然你看见了她——我的妻子，我心爱的妻子，”他重复着这些话的时候，他的嗓音和眼神全都显得越来越沉着，越来越坚定，显然他正在按照一个坚定不移的意志行事，“既然你已经看见她落入这种不利的处境，那么，对这个问题，你就应当也用我的眼光来看，体会一下我的心情，了解一下我的意见，这样才对，才合宜。因为我已经决定了，”运货夫凝视着他说，“而且现在什么也动摇不了我了。”

泰克尔顿咕噜了几句一般性的表示同意的话，说什么作一些剖白确实是必要的等等，可是他却被他的伙伴的态度吓得怔住了。运货夫相貌平平，性格粗鲁，然而此时却透露出一种庄严和高贵的气质，而这种气质只有那蕴藏着豁达和崇高的胸襟的人的灵魂才能显现出来。

“我是个相貌平平的粗汉，”运货夫又接着说，“一无可取。我一点儿也不聪明，这你再清楚不过。我也不年轻了。我爱我的小不点儿，是因为我在她父亲的家里，从小看着她长大，是因为我知道她有多么可爱，是因为她是我的命根子已经有好多好多年。尽管有许多人我是比不上的，可是我认为他们决不能像我那样爱我的小不点儿！”

他顿住了。在他再开口说话之前，有短短的一段时间，他的一只脚轻轻地拍打着地面。

“我曾经常常这么想：虽然我配不上她，可是我一定要做一个对她体贴入微的好丈夫。而且对于她的可贵，也许我比别人更清楚。就这样我觉得心安理得起来，于是就认为我和她结婚还是可能的。结果事情发生了，我们真的结了婚。”

“哈！”泰克尔顿意味深长地摇了一下头，说。

“我考察过自己，我也有过亲身的体验，我明白自己是多么深情地爱着她，也知道我将会多么幸福，”运货夫继续说，“可是我就是没有——我现在才觉察到这个——没有充分地考虑过她这方面。”

“你的确是没有啊，”泰克尔顿说，“轻浮成性，操守不坚，水性杨花，喜欢人家阿谀奉承！你就是没有考虑到！这一切你都没有看见！哈！”

“你最好别插嘴，”运货夫带着几分严厉说，“你先要明白我的意见才是，这你还差得远呢。如果说，昨天对一个胆敢说她一个字的坏话的人，我会一拳把他打倒的话，那么，今天，即使他是我的兄弟，我也要用脚踹他的脸！”

玩具商惊愕地睁大眼睛望着他。他继续说下去，语气比较温和了一些。

“当初我有没有考虑到，”运货夫说，“我娶她的时候，她才那么一点年纪，又那么美丽，就使她离开她的年轻伙伴们，离开那些让她在那儿增添光彩的许多场合。她在那些场合宛如一颗夜空中曾经闪烁过的最明亮的小星星，而我却使她成为我这个乏味的人的伴侣，一天又一天地关在我这个沉闷的家里，当初，我有没有考虑到这一切呢？我有没有考虑到对于像她那样脾气爽快的人来说，我是多么不适宜呢？像她那样活泼伶俐的人，跟像我这样拖拖拉拉的人在一起，是多么令人讨厌呢？我有没有考虑到在凡是知道她的人都一定会爱她的这种情况之下，我一无长处使自己配得上去爱她，也没有权利去爱她呢？我从来没有考虑到啊！我却利用了她那乐观的性格和她那快活的性情，于是我娶了她。我要是没有娶她就好啦！就是为了她，并非为我自己！”

玩具商眼睛一眨也不眨地盯着他瞧。这会儿，连他那只半闭的眼睛也大大地睁开着。

“愿上帝赐福给她！”运货夫说，“因为她那么长久以来一直显得快快活活的，为的是要瞒住我这一点！上帝可怜我吧，我的脑子这么迟钝，以前竟然没有发觉这一切！可怜的人儿！可怜的小不点儿！当人们谈到像我们这样的婚姻的时候，我见过她热泪盈眶，而我竟然没有发觉这一切！我也见过她的嘴唇暗暗地颤抖过无数次，而我竟然在昨晚之前从来没有怀疑过这一切！可怜的女孩子啊！我竟然希望她会爱我！我竟然相信她爱我！”

“她表现出爱你的样子，”泰克尔顿说，“老实告诉你吧，就因为她表现得过了分，才引起我的疑惑哩。”

说到这儿，他就果断地提及梅·费尔丁的卓越之处，说她根本就没有表现出爱他的样子。

“她曾经尽力而为，”可怜的运货夫的情绪比刚才一直显露出来的更为激动了，“到现在我才明白过来，她尽了多大的努力来做我的贤惠而热诚的妻子。她一向是那么善良，她做了那么多的事情，她有一颗多么勇敢、多么坚强的心哪！让我在这个屋子里所享受过的幸福来做证吧！等到我孤零零地待在这儿的时候，我所享受过的幸福会于我有益，会给我安慰的。”

“孤零零地待在这儿？”泰克尔顿说，“那么对于这件事你是打算认真处理的了？”

“我是打算，”运货夫答道，“尽我最大的力量和最大的热诚帮助她，让她得到最好的补偿。我能够把她从不匹配的婚姻所造成的痛苦之中，和拼命隐瞒着这一痛苦的挣扎之中，解救出来。她将获得尽我所能使她得到的最大的自由。”

“让她得到补偿！”泰克尔顿喊了起来，伸手把自己的两只大耳朵扭过来又翻过去，“这里一定出过什么事了。当然，你没有提起这件事。”

运货夫一把抓住玩具商的领口，把他摇得像一根风中的芦苇一般。

“听着！”运货夫说，“留神别把我的话听错了。听着。我说得清楚吗？”

“确实很清楚。”泰克尔顿回答道。

“和我的本意一样吗？”

“和你的本意完全一样。”

“昨天晚上我在炉边坐了整整一夜，”运货夫大声说道，“就坐在那个她时常坐在我旁边、转过她那甜蜜的脸蛋儿盯着我瞧的地方。我想起了她日常的全部生活。可爱的她本人的一举一动都在我眼前再次显现。的的确确，她是无罪的——假如有神来判断有罪还是没有罪的话！”

啊，坚贞的炉边蟋蟀！忠心耿耿的家宅之神！

“激动和疑惑已经离开我了！”运货夫说，“除了忧伤，我的心中再也没有什么了。在一个不幸的时刻，有一个昔日的情人回来了。不论按她的爱好或年龄来说，这个人都比我合适，而当初也许是为了我，她不情愿地把他抛弃了。在一个不幸的时刻，她突然遇到这件意外的事情，还没来得及思考一下自己干了什么，就把那件事隐瞒起来，成了那人的奸计的同谋者。昨天晚上，我们目睹了她去和他幽会。那当然是错的。可是除此之外，她是无罪的——如果世界上有真理的话！”

“如果你的意见是这样——”泰克尔顿开始说话了。

“因此就让她去吧！”运货夫接着说，“带着我的祝福和宽恕去吧！为了她给我的那么多快乐的时光，我祝福她；不管她曾经使我怎样痛苦，我都宽恕她。让她去吧，而且像我所希望的，心境安宁！她将永远不会恨我。等到我不再是她的累赘，她感到我系在她身上的那条链子放松了一点的时候，她就会渐渐地更喜欢我了。今天正是我那么不考虑她的幸福就从她的家里把她娶了来的日子。今天她将回到自己家里去，我不再把她缠住了。她的父亲和母亲今天会到这儿来——我们有一个大家一块儿过这一天的小小的计划——我要请他们把她领回去。在那儿也好，在不论什么地方也好，我都信得过她。她离开我的时候无可指责，我相信她也将会无可指责地生活下去。万一我死了——也许当她还年轻的时候，我就会死去；要知道，才这几小时我已经有些丧失勇气了——她将会发现我一直记着她，爱着她，直到咽气！这就是你昨天晚上让我看到的那件事情的结局。现在已经结束了！”

“啊，不，约翰，并没有结束。别说已经结束了！还没有结束哩。我已经听见你的一番高尚的话语了。我不能就这么溜走，假装不理会那些打动了我的心的话，对此我是非常感激的。在时钟还没有再敲响之前，别说已经结束了吧！”

刚才在泰克尔顿走进屋子不久，运货夫的妻子也走了进来，而且始终留在屋子里。她一眼也没有看泰克尔顿，却老是盯着她的丈夫瞧。可是她却不走近他，在他们中间尽可能保持着一段距离。虽然他说话的时候那片真诚感人至深，但是即使在那个时候，她也没有走近他。这和过去的她多么不同啊！

“没有一个人能够制造一座时钟来为我敲出已经逝去的时光了，”运货夫苦笑着回答，“就让这件事这么办了吧，亲爱的。时钟马上就要敲响了。我们说些什么，那是无关紧要的。对于比这更难处理的事情，我会尽力办得合你的心意。”

“好吧！”泰克尔顿喃喃地说，“我得走了，因为时钟再敲响的时候，我就得动身去教堂了。再见，约翰·皮瑞宾格尔。你不能光临，我真感到遗憾。对于这个损失和造成这个损失的那件事，我都感到遗憾极了！”

“我的话说得可明白吗？”运货夫问道，一边送他到门口。

“啊，很明白！”

“你会记得我所说的话吗？”

“唔，如果你逼着我留意的话，我会记得的，”泰克尔顿说，这时候他已经小心翼翼地上了马车，“不过我得说，那确实太出乎我的意料了，所以我是不大可能忘记的。”

“这将对我们俩都有好处，”运货夫回答道，“再见！我祝你快乐！”

“我要是也能祝你快乐就好了，”泰克尔顿说，“可惜我不能；谢谢你。让我对你说句体己的话儿，（像我先前跟你说的那样，嗯？）我想我婚后的生活不会不快乐的，因为梅一向对我不是管头管脚的，也不是感情外露的。再见了！保重身体呀！”

运货夫站在那儿目送着他，直到远远望过去，泰克尔顿的身子比他近旁的马头上的花朵和彩球还要小；于是运货夫长叹了一声，走到附近的榆树林中，像一个心乱如麻、垂头丧气的人那样徘徊着，不愿意回到屋子里去，直到时钟快要敲响的时候。

他那个小妻子被孤孤单单地撇在屋子里，凄惨地哽咽着；不过她不时擦干眼泪，克制着自己，说他多么好，说他好到了极点！有一两次她还笑了，笑得那么欢畅，那么得意扬扬，又那么断断续续的（一边始终在哭着），这可把蒂蕾吓坏了。

“噢，请你别这样！”蒂蕾说，“这样要把宝宝吓死，葬送掉的，所以请你不要这样！”

“蒂蕾，今后你愿意有时候带他来看看他的爸爸吗？”她的女主人揩着眼泪问道，“我不能住在这儿了，必须回到老家去了。”

“噢，请你别这样！”蒂蕾叫嚷着，头朝后一仰，突然号哭起来，这会儿她的模样非常像拳击手，“噢，请你别这样！噢，哪个人家呀，那么随随便便跟人家断绝了关系，把别人家害得这么惨呀？噢！呜——呜——呜！”

就在这时候，软心肠的施罗博埃把声音拖成那么悲惨的号叫，由于长时间的抑制，这一发作也就格外猛烈了，要不是她一眼瞥见凯莱布·普卢默领着他的女儿走进屋子里来，必定会把宝宝吵醒，并且把他吓成重病（可能会发惊风病）。她看见凯莱布·普卢默父女俩走进屋子里来，也就恢复了应该顾全礼节的感觉，她有那么一会儿工夫一声不吭地站着，嘴巴张得大大的，接着飞快地跑到孩子正酣睡着的那张床旁，就像跳圣维特斯舞[23]的病人那样奇怪地在地板上跳起舞来，同时又把脸和头都塞进被褥中乱搅一阵，显然想从这些离奇的动作中得到莫大的慰藉。

“玛丽！”蓓莎说，“没有去参加婚礼！”

“我告诉她说你不会到那儿去的，太太，”凯莱布压低了嗓音说，“昨天晚上我就听见了许多话。不过愿上帝保佑你，”那个小个子亲切地握着小不点儿的双手说，“我可不管他们讲些什么，我不相信他们。我并没有什么了不起的地方，可是只要我一相信人家说你的一句坏话，我所仅有的那么一丁点儿的长处也就应该给撕个粉碎了！”

他的双臂搂住她的脖子，拥抱了她，像一个孩子拥抱他自己的洋娃娃那样。

“蓓莎今天早上不能待在家里，”凯莱布说，“我知道她是怕听见教堂的钟声。在他们结婚的日子里，她离他们那么近，她完全没有把握自己会怎么样。因此我们就按时出发，来到了这儿。我一直在想自己做过的一些事，”凯莱布顿了一下又说，“我一直在责备自己给她造成了痛苦，我难过得简直不知道该怎么办，简直走投无路了；终于我决定，太太，如果你愿意和我站在一起，我最好就趁这个时候把事情的真相告诉她。我这样做的时候，你愿意和我站在一起吗？”他问道，浑身上下直发抖，“我不知道可能会给她带来什么影响，我不知道她对我将会有什么想法，我不知道以后她还会不会再关心她可怜的爸爸了，但是她最好别再受骗了，因此我必须承受我所应该承受的后果！”

“玛丽，”蓓莎说，“你的手在哪儿？啊！在这儿，在这儿！”她微笑着把玛丽的手压在自己的嘴唇上，然后又拉过来穿过自己的胳臂，“昨天晚上他们窃窃私语，谈论着你的什么过错。他们错了。”

运货夫的妻子默不作声。凯莱布代她回答了。

“他们错了。”他说。

“我早就知道他们是错的！”蓓莎得意地大声说，“我也就那么告诉了他们。那些话一句也不屑去听！那样责怪她，根本就不公平！”说着，她双手紧紧握住玛丽的手，把自己柔软的面颊贴在玛丽的脸上，“不！我的眼睛可没有瞎成那样。”

蓓莎的父亲走到她的那一边，这时，小不点儿仍旧待在蓓莎的身旁，握着她的一只手。

“对于你们大家，”蓓莎说，“我都了解得比你们所想象的更清楚。但是我对她是了解得最清楚的了。爸爸，甚至对于你，我都没有了解得像了解她那么清楚。在我的周围没有一个人及得上她一半的真实和真诚。如果就在这一刻，我能够恢复视力，不等她说一句话，我就能从一群人当中认出她来的！她简直是我的亲姐姐！”

“蓓莎，我亲爱的！”凯莱布说，“我心里有些话要告诉你，趁这会儿只有我们三个人，请你听我说吧！我要向你作个表白，我的宝贝。”

“表白，爸爸？”

“我曾经离开诚实，以致迷了路，我的孩子，”他面有难色，神情怪可怜地说，“我曾经离开诚实，一心想要对你好，可是却成了对你的残酷。”

她向他转过脸来，脸上满是诧异之极的神情，也跟着说：“残酷！”

“他把自己责备得太狠了，蓓莎，”小不点儿说，“要不了多久你就会这么说的。你将是头一个对他这么说的人。”

“他对我残酷！”蓓莎大声说，疑惑地微笑着。

“我并不是存心要那样，我的孩子，”凯莱布说，“可是我过去确实是残酷的，尽管在昨天之前，我自己从来没有怀疑过这个情况。我亲爱的瞎眼的女儿，听我说，并且宽恕我吧！我的心肝呀，你居住的这个世界并不像我对你所描述的那样存在着。你一向信任的那双眼睛欺骗了你。”

她那张诧异之极的脸仍旧朝着他，但是她向后退缩，把她的朋友抱得更紧了。

“你在世间的道路是崎岖不平的，我可怜的孩子，”凯莱布说，“我以前有意为你把它铺平。为了使你快乐一些，我把各种东西都改头换面，把人们的性格也都说成了另一个样儿，还捏造了种种从来就不曾有过的事情。我隐瞒了你，欺骗了你，求上帝宽恕我！我把你置于幻想之中了。”

“可是活着的人并不是幻想出来的吧？”她急忙说道，顿时脸色变得非常苍白，依然远避着他，“你改变不了他们。”

“我是把他们改变了，蓓莎，”凯莱布争辩着说，“有一个你所晓得的人，我的宝贝——”

“啊，爸爸！你为什么说是我所晓得的？”她用强烈责备的口气回答，“我又晓得什么东西，晓得什么人呀！我根本是个没有人指导的人！我又瞎得这么可怜！”

她内心痛苦得莫可名状，于是蓦地伸出了双手，好像在摸索去路似的，接着带着极度绝望凄惨的神情，双手一摊，掩住了脸。

“今天所举行的那场婚礼，”凯莱布说，“男方是一个冷酷、卑鄙而又刻薄的人。许多年来，他是你我的苛刻的老板。他外貌丑陋，性格别扭，总是冷冰冰的，毫无人情味儿。他并不像我在所有的事情上向你所描绘的那样，我的孩子。在所有的事情上他都不是那样啊。”

“唉，为什么，”瞎眼的女孩子喊道，她似乎已经痛苦得支撑不住了，“你又为什么这么做呀？你究竟为什么要把我的心填得满满的，然后又像个死神一样走了进来，把我所心爱的对象统统撕碎？啊，天哪，我的眼睛可瞎极啦！我无依无靠，我多么孤单呀！”

她的哀伤的父亲垂下了头，一言不发，沉浸在悔恨和悲痛之中。

她陷入这种失望的情绪之中不到一会儿工夫，炉边那只蟋蟀就开始啾啾啾地唱起来了，不过除了她没有人听得见。那只蟋蟀并不是欢快地唱着，而是用低沉无力的悲痛的声音唱着。那声音哀伤得令人鼻酸，她的泪水禁不住簌簌而下。那个曾经一整夜站在运货夫身边的精灵在她背后出现了，并且抬起了手，指着她的父亲，这时候，她的眼泪就像雨一般地洒下来了。

不久她更清楚地听到蟋蟀的声音了。在她瞎眼的情形下，她感觉到那精灵在她父亲的身边徘徊着。

“玛丽，”瞎眼的女孩儿说，“请你告诉我，我的家是什么样子的。它真正是什么样子的。”

“它是很差的一个地方，蓓莎；实在很寒酸，一贫如洗。到来年冬天，恐怕那房子就要挡不住风雨了。”小不点儿继续用一种低沉而清晰的声音说，“它现在只能勉强遮蔽风雨，就像你可怜的爸爸穿的那件粗麻布大衣也只能勉强御寒一样。”

瞎眼的女孩儿大大激动起来，站起身来把运货夫的小妻子拉到了一边。

“我那么小心照看着的那些礼物，差不多都是随着我的愿望一一出现，受到我那么热切的欢迎，”她颤抖着说，“它们从哪儿来的？是你送的吗？”

“不是。”

“那么是谁送的呢？”

小不点儿看出她已经明白了，也就保持着沉默。瞎眼女孩儿又张开双手举在面前，不过这会儿她的态度与之前迥然不同了。

“亲爱的玛丽，等一等。等一等！再过来一点儿。轻声告诉我。我知道你是诚实的。你现在不会欺骗我的，是吗？”

“不会的，蓓莎，真的不会！”

“是的，我相信你不会。你实在可怜我。玛丽，请你朝屋子的那一头看看，就是我们刚才待的那地方，我的爸爸现在在那儿——那个那么体恤我、那么疼我的爸爸——请你告诉我你看见了什么。”

“我看见，”小不点儿是很了解她的，说道，“一位老人家坐在椅子上，忧伤地靠着椅背，一只手支着脸。好像他的孩子应该去劝慰他似的，蓓莎。”

“对啊，对啊！她是要去的。请讲下去吧。”

“他已经有一大把年纪了，被忧虑和操劳折磨得衰弱不堪。他是个瘦小干枯、郁郁寡欢、忧心忡忡的白发老人。我这会儿看见他意气消沉地垂下头来，显出毫无斗志的神态。可是，蓓莎啊，我过去见过他许多次，为了一个伟大的神圣的目的，他千方百计、历尽艰辛地奋斗着。因此我敬重他的苍苍白发，并且祈求上帝祝福他！”

瞎眼女孩儿突然从她的身旁跑开，扑到她的父亲面前跪下来，把那白发苍苍的头抱在她的怀中。

“我的视力恢复了。这就是我的视力！”她叫喊道，“以前我是瞎的，现在我的眼睛睁开啦。我从来就不曾了解他！想想看，我本来有可能到死都没有真正看见始终那么疼爱我的爸爸，这会叫人多么伤心啊！”

凯莱布这时候的情绪是难以言喻的。

“在这个世界上，”瞎眼女孩儿拥抱着他嚷着，“没有一个高贵的人我会爱得像爱这个人这么深，这么虔诚地珍爱！爸爸啊，你的头发越白，你越衰老，你就越可爱！人们永远别再说我瞎眼了。在我向上帝祷告和感恩的时候，没有一道你脸上的皱纹和一根你头上的头发我会忘记！”

凯莱布好不容易才说出话来：“我的蓓莎！”

“因为我的眼睛看不见，”女孩儿深受感动，淌下了眼泪，爱抚着她的父亲，说道，“以前我完全以为他不是这样的！他一天又一天地守在我的身边，总是无微不至地照料着我，我却做梦也没想到他原来是这样的！”

“那个穿蓝色外衣、精神抖擞、气度潇洒的爸爸，蓓莎啊，”可怜的凯莱布说，“他已经不存在了。”

“没有一样东西不存在了，”她回答说，“最亲爱的爸爸，没有呀！所有的东西都在这儿——在你这里！在我深深爱着的，我从来就没有爱得够深的，也从来没有了解的爸爸这里；在起初因为他深切同情我，所以我敬爱他的这位恩人这里；一切的一切都在这儿，在你这里呀！对我来说，没有一样已经消逝。我所感到的最最可贵的那一切的灵魂就在这儿——和这张衰老的脸、苍苍的白发在一起。我呀，我不再是瞎眼的了，爸爸！”

当父女俩这样谈着的时候，小不点儿全神贯注地看着他们。这会儿她朝摩尔式宫殿前草场上的制作干草小人儿望去，这才看见在几分钟之内那座时钟就要敲响了，她立即陷入焦灼和兴奋的状态中。

“爸爸，”蓓莎支支吾吾地说，“玛丽。”

“哎，亲爱的，”凯莱布答道，“她在这儿呢。”

“我相信，她没有什么改变。关于她，你从来没有告诉我什么不真实的事情吧？”

“如果我能把她说得比她的实际情况更好的话，”凯莱布回答说，“亲爱的，恐怕过去我也会这样做的。可是就是把她的面目也来个改变，那我一定会把她改坏了的。因为怎么说也不能把她说得更好了，蓓莎。”

虽然刚才瞎眼女孩儿提出这个问题的时候，是很自信的，可是她听到这样的回答，那种欣喜雀跃的神情，又一次把小不点儿紧紧抱在怀中的模样，这情景确实是迷人的。

“可是也许会有比你所能想到的更多的变化要发生哩，亲爱的。”小不点儿说，“我指的是向好的方面的变化，变化得使我们中间有些人得到极大的快乐。要是像这样的变化果真发生的话，你一定不会因为那些事过于令人吃惊以致受到什么影响吧？——听，那是路上的车轮声吗？蓓莎，你的耳朵灵敏。是车轮的声音吗？”

“不错。很快地朝这儿驶来呢。”

“我——我——我就晓得你的耳朵非常灵敏，”小不点儿说着一边把一只手按在胸口上，一边尽快地继续说下去，显然为的是不让人觉察她那颗心扑扑地猛跳起来，“因为我常常注意到这个，也因为昨天晚上你那么快就听出那个生人的脚步声。蓓莎，虽然我不懂当时你为什么会问‘那是谁的脚步声？’——我记得清清楚楚你是这么问的——你又为什么对那个脚步声比对其他任何人的脚步声更为注意？虽然就像我刚才说的那样，在这个世界上会发生极大的变化，是极大的变化呀，我们还得有思想准备，使自己几乎不论对什么事情都不要太吃惊才好。”

凯莱布对这番话摸不着头脑，他觉得小不点儿的话既是对他的女儿又是对他本人说的。他大为诧异，因为他看见她心慌意乱和焦虑得几乎透不过气来，她还生怕自己会倒下去，紧紧抓住一把椅子支撑着。

“那的确是车轮声！”她气喘吁吁地说，“走近啦！更近啦！非常近啦！现在你们听得见他们已经在花园门前停下了！现在你们听得见门外有脚步声——和昨天晚上同样的脚步声，不是吗？蓓莎！——现在，啊！”

只见一个年轻人冲进屋来，摘下帽子，随手往空中一扔，忽地冲到他们跟前，小不点儿快乐得情不自禁，大叫一声，向凯莱布飞奔过去，伸出双手蒙住了他的眼睛。

“办好了？”小不点儿大声问道。

“办好了！”

“办得称心？”

“称心！”

“你可记得这个嗓音，亲爱的凯莱布？你以前可听见过像这样的嗓音吗？”小不点儿叫喊着。

“如果我那个在遍地黄金的南美洲的孩子还活着的话——”凯莱布说着浑身发抖起来。

“他还活着呀！”小不点儿尖声叫喊道，同时把蒙住凯莱布双眼的手放下来，兴奋地拍着手，“瞧他，瞧他就站在你跟前，又健康，又结实！你自己的宝贝亲儿子！你的亲爱的、还活着的、疼爱你的亲哥哥，蓓莎！”

这个小人儿欣喜若狂，让大家为此都向她致敬吧！看见他们父子（女）三人抱成一团时，她欢笑得直淌眼泪，让大家为此都向她致敬吧！让大家也向她那份欢迎那个水手的热诚致敬吧——她那玫瑰红的嘴唇一点儿也没有避开，听凭那个飘扬着从中间对分的头发、皮肤晒得黝黑的水手尽情地吻它，并且把她紧压在自己猛烈跳动的胸口上！

让大家也向那只杜鹃致敬吧——为什么不呢？——因为它活像一个强盗，倏地从摩尔式宫殿的活板门里探身而出，对着这一群聚集在一块儿的人打了十二下嗝儿，好像它已经陶醉在欢乐之中了。

这时候，运货夫从屋外进来，吓得朝后退了一步，他发现自己来到了这么快乐的一群人中间，也难怪他要吃惊了。

“喂，约翰！”凯莱布眉飞色舞地说，“瞧这儿！从遍地黄金的南美洲回来的我的孩子！我的亲生儿子！就是你帮助他配备一切又亲自把他送走的那个人！就是你从前的那个好朋友！”

运货夫走上前去猛地抓住他的手，可是那人的一部分面貌使他想起马车上那个聋老头儿，他不禁退缩了一下，说：

“爱德华！昨天那个人就是你吗？”

“现在把一切都告诉他吧！”小不点儿叫了起来，“把一切都告诉他，爱德华！不必略过我，因为在他的眼睛里，再也不会有什么事需要我饶恕我自己的了。”

“那个人就是我。”爱德华说。

“那么你竟然化了装，偷偷混进你老朋友的家？从前那个光明磊落的小伙子——凯莱布，那是多少年以前的事了啊，我们听说他已经死了，我们还认为已经证实了？——那个小伙子是决不会干这种勾当的。”

“我从前有一个气度宽大的朋友，他对于我与其说是朋友，倒更像是父亲，”爱德华说，“他决不会不听分辩就对我或对任何其他人擅自下判断。你正是那种人。因此我相信现在你会听我讲的。”

运货夫不安地朝仍然远避着他的小不点儿望了一眼，然后回答：“好！这倒也公平。我听你讲。”

“你该知道的，我离开这儿时还年轻，”爱德华说，“那时我已经爱上了一个姑娘，她也爱我。当时她很年轻，也许对自己的心思还不清楚——你可能会对我这么说，可是当时我对自己的心思就是很清楚的，当时我就是深深地爱她的。”

“你当时就是那样！”运货夫喊道，“你！”

“我的确是那样，”对方回答说，“而且她也爱我。我始终相信她当时是爱我的，而现在我确实知道她是那样。”

“我的天哪！”运货夫说，“这可比什么都糟！”

“我对她始终忠贞不渝，”爱德华说，“我历尽艰辛，满怀着热望回来履行我们旧日的婚约，不料在二十英里以外的路上，我听说她已经辜负了我，她已经把我忘掉了，已经把自己许配给了别人，是一个比我富有的人。我一点也不想责备她；可是我希望看一看她，并且证实一下是否确有其事。我希望她是被迫这么做的，是违背自己的心愿并且无力反抗的。那样，对我只是一个很小的安慰，但是我认为到底还是可以得到一些安慰，因此我就来了。为了便于了解实情，了解确确实实的实情；为了便于我亲自无拘无束地观察，由我自己来判断，同时也为了即使我自己不会遇到任何妨碍，又不至于因为我的露面而对她产生影响——假如我对她还有任何影响的话，于是我把自己打扮得完全变了个样儿——你知道是个什么样儿的；然后在路上等着——你知道是在哪儿。你对我一点也不怀疑，她——她也不怀疑，”他向小不点儿指了一下，“直到在那个壁炉旁我悄悄地对她耳语，她才知道是我，当时她只差一点儿就把我暴露了。”

“可是她知道爱德华并没有死，他已经回来了，”小不点儿啜泣着，这会儿她为自己说话了，在爱德华叙述的整个过程中，她一直急于开口，“并且知道了他的目的以后，就劝他对这事必须严守秘密；因为他的老朋友约翰·皮瑞宾格尔的性格过于坦率，对于耍手段一窍不通，”说到这里，小不点儿半笑半哭地说，“他实在太不灵敏了，是难以叫他保守秘密的。于是她——那就是我，约翰——”那个小女人哽咽着说，“把一切都告诉了爱德华，说他的情人怎样相信他已经死了，又怎样最终在她的母亲死命地劝说下答应了那个老糊涂所说的上好的亲事。接着她——那还是我，约翰——又告诉他说，他们还没有结婚，但是快了。又说如果他们结婚，那么对梅来说，完全是个牺牲，因为在她这方面是没有爱情的；他听到这番话以后，快乐得几乎发狂了；于是她——那还是我——说她愿意像从前那样为他们奔走，约翰，试探一下他的情人，以便确定她自己——还是我，约翰——所说和所想的究竟对不对。结果发现完全正确，约翰！而且，约翰啊，他们在一小时以前已经结了婚！瞧，新娘在这儿！而格拉夫和泰克尔顿这下子可能要当一辈子光棍了！我可是个幸福的小女人，梅，愿上帝祝福你！”

小不点儿原本就是一个叫人没法不喜欢的小女人，如果这么说是中肯的话，那么她目前狂喜的模样儿简直逗人喜欢到前所未有的程度了。也从来没有一种祝贺像她慷慨地给予她自己和那个新娘的那么惹人喜爱，使人欢乐的了。

老实的运货夫，心潮澎湃，已经在那儿站了半晌，手足无措。这时候他向小不点儿飞奔过去，她伸出手来阻挡他，像以前一样退缩和回避着他。

“不，约翰，别过来！听我讲完！在我还没说完每一句我必须讲的话之前，别再爱我了。我有一个秘密瞒着你，这是不对的，约翰，我真对不起你。在昨天晚上我走来挨着你坐在小凳子上之前，我没有想到那样做有什么害处；可是我见到你脸上那么明显的表情以后，我知道你看见了我和爱德华在走廊上散步，也明白了你想些什么；那时候我才感到我那样做是多么轻率，多么不对。但是，哦，亲爱的约翰啊，你怎么竟然——竟然有那样的想法啊！”

这个小女人又伤心透了，抽抽噎噎地哭起来。约翰·皮瑞宾格尔差点儿就把她抱在怀中了。可是不成，因为她不让他抱。

“请你且慢爱我，约翰！你还得等好长一段时间呢！当初我为那门已经订下的婚事感到难过，那是因为我想起了梅和爱德华是那么年轻的一对情人，我也知道梅的心是远离着泰克尔顿的。现在你相信这一切了吧。是不是，约翰？”

约翰大为感动，又要朝小不点儿冲过去，可是又被她拦住了。

“不，请你待在那儿，约翰！我笑你——约翰，我有时候就爱笑你；叫你又呆又可爱的老傻瓜，以及其他类似的名称，这是因为我太爱你了，约翰；我那么喜欢你种种的样子；即使你明天让人推选出来当国王，我也不愿意看见你在任何方面有一点儿变化。”

“好哇！”凯莱布异常有力地说道，“这也正是我的意见！”

“还有，我平时提到老实稳健的中年人，约翰，我假装我们是一对索然无味的老夫妻，过着单调呆板的生活，那只是因为我是个那么愚蠢的小东西，约翰，有时候我就喜欢跟我们的小宝宝闹着玩儿，演演戏啦什么的——就是那么装模作样的，毫无其他什么意思。”

看见运货夫又走过来，她又阻止了他。可是这一次她几乎没有来得及拦住他。

“不，别爱我，请你再等一两分钟，约翰！我最想要告诉你的话，是留在最后说的。我亲爱的、善良的、宽大为怀的约翰，那天晚上，我们谈论那只蟋蟀的时候，我有话就在嘴边，却没有说出来。我想说的是：起初我并不像现在爱你这么深；我刚来到这儿这个家里的时候，我还有点儿担心自己不会完完全全像自己所希望和所祈祷的那样爱你——因为我是那么年轻，约翰。可是亲爱的约翰啊，后来每过一天，每过一个小时，我却越来越爱你了。假如我爱你能比目前更深的话，那么今天早上我听见的你那番高尚的言语就会使我那样。可是我不能啊。因为我已经把我全部的爱倾注在你的身上了，而我的爱是很深很深的，约翰，并且那是很久很久以前你就完全配得到的，我已经毫无保留地给了你，毫无剩余了。现在，我亲爱的丈夫，把我再抱在你的怀里吧！这儿是我的家，约翰，永远、永远不要想到把我送到其他的地方去啊！”

如果你亲眼见到小不点儿奔向前去扑到运货夫的怀抱里的话，那你一定会感到极大的欣喜。那是你在见到另外一个人拥抱着一个非凡的小女人的时候所感到的欢愉所远远及不上的。那是你毕生所没有见到过的最完美、最纯粹、最能引起心灵共鸣的一点点真诚。

你完全可以相信运货夫这时候欣喜若狂，你也完全可以相信小不点儿也是如此，你还完全可以相信他们大家全都欣喜若狂——包括施罗博埃小姐在内，她高兴得大喊大叫，还希望让她怀中的孩子也参加到大家互相道喜的活动中去，于是那孩子就在他们中间一个接一个地传递着，仿佛他是供人喝的什么饮料。

可是这会儿他们又听见门外传来辘辘的车轮声，还听见有人喊道：“格拉夫和泰克尔顿回来啦。”接着那位可尊敬的老爷很快地出现了，神情急躁而又狼狈。

“喂，究竟怎么回事，约翰·皮瑞宾格尔？”泰克尔顿说，“一定出了什么差错啦。我约了泰克尔顿夫人在教堂里会面，可是我敢发誓，在路上我和她错过了，她是上这儿来了。啊！她在这儿！请原谅，先生，我还不认识你，可是如果我可以请你让这位年轻的女士脱身的话，今天上午她倒是有一个非常特殊的约会哩！”

“可是我不能放她走，”爱德华答道，“那是我想都没法去想的事。”

“你这是什么意思？你这个流氓！”泰克尔顿说。

“我的意思是，对于你这样生气我既然能够体谅，”对方微笑着回答，“那么对于今天早上这种粗话，我也就能够像对昨天晚上所有那些话那样，一律不予理睬。”

泰克尔顿用了那样的眼光望着他，表现出那种大吃一惊的样子！

“非常抱歉，先生，”爱德华说，一边把梅的左手推向前，使那只无名指尤其显眼，“这位年轻的女士不能陪你上教堂去了。可是今天上午她已经去过一次教堂了，这你也许会原谅她吧。”

泰克尔顿眼睁睁地盯住那只无名指瞧，然后从背心口袋里掏出一小张银白色的纸，显然里面包着一枚戒指。

“施罗博埃小姐，”泰克尔顿说，“劳驾你把这个扔进火里去好吗？谢谢你。”

“我的的确确告诉你，我们是以前订的婚，是在很早以前，因此她才不能遵守和你的约定。”爱德华说。

“泰克尔顿先生会公道地承认我曾经忠实地把这件事告诉过他，而且我告诉过他许多次，我永远也忘不了我以前的婚约。”梅说，脸上泛起了红晕。

“唔，确实是那样！”泰克尔顿说，“唔，确有其事。唔，没关系。这样做是很正确的。爱德华·普卢默太太，我推断是这样的名字吧？”

“正是这个名字。”那个新郎回答说。

“啊，我原不该认识你的，先生，”泰克尔顿仔细察看着他的脸说道，然后深深地鞠了一躬，“我祝你快乐，先生！”

“谢谢你。”

“皮瑞宾格尔太太，”泰克尔顿突然朝小不点儿和她的丈夫站在一块儿的地方转过身去说，“我对不起你。你并没有尽力帮我的忙，可是确确实实我是对不起你的。你比我过去认为的更好。约翰·皮瑞宾格尔，我对不起你。你了解我，所以这就够了。事情这么办非常正确，女士们和先生们，也全都十分美满。再见！”

他用这番话应付过去了，说罢也就那么走了，只在门前停了一下，把马头上的那些花朵和彩球解下来，又朝马的肋部踢了一脚，好像借此告诉那匹马说，他的安排出了问题。

当然啰，现在应该认真地把这个日子好好安排一下，使它在皮瑞宾格尔家的日历上永远标志着为这些事件贺喜设宴。于是小不点儿着手筹备一个能把不朽的光荣反映在这个家以及一应有关人等身上的盛宴。不一会儿工夫，她的一双手臂已经埋在面粉里，一直没到她那有小窝儿的胳膊肘儿上，还把运货夫抹得一身白粉，因为每次他走近的时候，她总要拦住他吻他一下。这个好汉子又洗青菜又削萝卜，又砰的一下打碎几个碟子，接着又撞翻火炉上几个盛满冷水的铁锅子，他还显得自己不管在哪一方面都能帮得了忙的样子。与此同时，从附近什么地方好像在生死关头急忙请来的两个内行帮手，在所有的门口和所有的转角上都撞个满怀。所有的人也到处被蒂蕾·施罗博埃和小宝宝绊住。蒂蕾从来没有表现出这么劲头十足，她无处不在，博得大家不断异口同声的称赞。在两点二十五分钟的时候，她是走廊上的一个障碍物；在正两点半钟的时候，她在厨房里成了一架捕人机；在两点三十五分钟的时候，她是顶楼里的一个陷阱；而小宝宝的脑袋也就好像是一块各色各样的物质——动物、植物、矿物的试验品和试金石。那一天用上的东西，没有一样不是迟早要跟那个脑袋亲密地接触一下的。

接下来大家组成了一支伟大的徒步探险队去寻找费尔丁太太，他们打算神情阴郁地向那位出色的夫人表示悔过，然后把她带回到皮瑞宾格尔家中来，如果必要的话，不惜使用强迫手段；要让她来了以后快活起来，并且宽恕他们。探险队刚找到她的时候，不管说什么她一概不听，只顾一味说着自己怎么也想不到竟然会活着看见这样的一天！又说：“现在把我抬进坟墓里去吧！”除了这句话，怎么也没法使她说其他的话。这简直是她的无稽之谈，因为她并没有死，也没有一点儿要死的样子。过了一会儿，她又陷入一种可怕的平静状态，说在那笔靛青生意中发生那一连串倒霉的事情的时候，她就预料到，在她的一生中将遭受各种侮辱和谩骂，因此如今发现情况正是这样，反倒使她觉得高兴，她恳求他们不要费事来管她了——因为她又算得了什么呢？哼！只是一个无足轻重的人而已！——要他们忘掉还有这么一个人活着，要他们只当没有她这个人而过自己的日子得了。接着她从刻薄挖苦转变为了愤怒，并且用这样奇怪的话来发泄她的愤怒。她说，一条蚯蚓给踩了都会转过身来的啊；随后她又变得温和了，说只要他们信得过她，在她力所能及的范围之内，她又会有什么建议不提供的呢！这时候，探险队就利用她这个情绪转折的关头，把她团团围住。不一会儿她也就戴上了手套，打扮得无可指摘，气派十足，动身到约翰·皮瑞宾格尔的家去了，身旁还放着一个纸包，里面装着一顶华丽的帽子，那帽子几乎和主教冠一样高，一般挺拔。

现在只等小不点儿的父亲和母亲的那辆小马车的到来了。可是等了好久还不见来，大家便担心起来，不断地朝路那头望去，希望能看见他们。而费尔丁太太却老是朝他们不可能来的错误方向望着，有人向她指出以后，她说，她希望自己有随心所欲朝哪儿看的自由。他们终于来到了——是一对胖墩墩的小个子，一路摇摇晃晃、舒舒泰泰地走了进来，那模样完全是小不点儿家的可爱气派。小不点儿和她的妈妈紧挨着，看了着实令人叫绝。因为她们俩简直一模一样。

于是小不点儿的母亲少不得要和梅的母亲见面寒暄一番。梅的母亲总是保持着她那种气派，小不点儿的母亲则从不摆什么气派，只是一双小脚主动得很。而老小不点儿呢——也就是称作小不点儿的父亲的那个人，刚才我忘了说那并非他的名字，不过这无关紧要——他待人很随和，一见面就热情握手，他似乎把一顶帽子看作只是用糨糊粘着棉布的一种玩意儿，他也毫不客气地提到那笔靛青生意，只说如今再也没有什么办法了；正如费尔丁太太所总结的，他是那种好脾气的人——她说，可就是粗俗了一点儿，亲爱的。

我无论如何也不愿意略过小不点儿不谈的。她穿了一身结婚礼服，正尽着主妇之谊，她的脸蛋儿多么欢愉！不！我也不愿意漏掉那个善良的运货夫，他坐在饭桌的一端。我也不愿意略过那个晒得黝黑的精力充沛的水手，以及他的美丽的妻子。他们这伙人中间的任何一个我都不愿意放过不谈。至于那一顿餐食，如果不提它一提，就会好比失去一个人所需要吃的一餐丰富而又令人愉快的美食；如果不谈一谈他们为这个结婚纪念日而举杯祝贺的那些满溢的酒杯，那更会是所有的损失之中最大的损失了。

吃过饭以后，凯莱布唱了一首关于“闪光的大酒杯”的歌曲：“因为我活着，希望活下去，一年，两年，这样过……”他唱完了整首歌。

我还要顺便说一下，正当他唱完最后一行歌词的时候，一件万万意想不到的事情发生了。

突然传来一下轻轻的敲门声，只见一个人既不道歉，又不请求原谅，径自趔趔趄趄地走进屋来，头上顶着一件沉重的东西。他把那东西放到桌子的中央，位置恰好是对称地处于那些坚果和苹果的中心，然后他说道：

“泰克尔顿先生向各位道喜，因为这个蛋糕他已经用不上了，也许你们愿意把它吃掉。”

说完他便走了。

你们该能想象得到，他们大伙儿不免有些惊讶，而费尔丁太太又是聪明过人的，她提醒大家说，这个蛋糕里一定下了毒药，于是讲了一则关于蛋糕的故事，说据她所知，有个蛋糕曾经把一个女神学院里的姑娘们毒得周身发青。可是她未能抵挡住大家的表决，结果这个蛋糕由梅欢天喜地、仪式十分隆重地切开了。

我想这个蛋糕还没有一个人吃上嘴，就又有人敲门了，出现的还是那个人，腋下夹着一个棕色的大纸包。

“泰克尔顿先生向各位道喜，他给孩子送来了几个玩具，都不是难看的呢。”

说完这句话，他又走了。

大家惊愕得瞠目结舌，即使有充分的时间，也无法说出话来，更何况他们一点儿时间也没有。因为那人几乎还没有关上门，又响起了敲门声，是泰克尔顿本人又走了进来。

“皮瑞宾格尔太太！”那个玩具商的手里拿着帽子说，“我很抱歉。比今天早上还要抱歉。我花时间把这件事想过了。约翰·皮瑞宾格尔！我这个人生性怪僻，可是跟你这样的人接近了以后，我不由得多少变得温柔一些了。凯莱布！这位小保姆昨天晚上无意中断断续续地给了我一些暗示，而我已经摸索出那个线索了。想到我自己竟然可能会毫不踌躇地使你和你的女儿受我的束缚，我感到惭愧极了。我又想到自己竟然把她看作一个白痴，我自己才是一个可怜的白痴哩！朋友们，我所有的朋友啊，今天晚上我的家非常冷清。我的炉边连一只蟋蟀都没有。我把它们全都吓跑了。请你们发个慈悲，让我参加这个快乐的宴会吧！”

五分钟以后，他便和在自己家里一样无拘无束了。你简直从来没有见到过那样的一个人。他这一生曾经是怎么搞的，竟然从来不知道自己能有那么多的快乐！要不然就是那些仙子对他作了些什么法，才使他变成这样的！

“约翰，今天晚上你不会把我送回家去的，是吧？”

可是他只差一点儿就要那么做了！

如今只缺一个生物来使这个宴会圆满了。可是一眨眼工夫，它来到了。它因为拼命奔跑，口渴难熬，硬要把头塞进一只窄小的水壶里去，真是白费劲。它曾经跟随那辆马车奔到路程的终点，因为它的主人不在而满肚子不高兴，反抗那个代理车夫到了惊人的地步。接着在马厩附近徘徊了一会儿，妄图煽动那匹老马采取反抗行动往回跑，可也是枉然，于是它就走进酒吧间，在火炉前躺了下来。可又突然坚信那个代理车夫是个骗子，必须弃绝他，便一下子站起来逃跑，就这样回到家里来了。

到了晚上，他们举行了一个舞会。我简略地提一提这场娱乐之后，原该撇下不谈的，可是我却有理由认为那是一个十分别致的、具有最不寻常的特点的舞会。整个舞会由一种奇特的方式组成，是这样的：

水手爱德华是一个善良、洒脱而又勇敢的人。他给大家讲各种奇闻怪事，关于鹦哥、矿山、墨西哥人、金粉，等等。突然间一个念头闪进他的脑袋，他从座位上跳起来，提出要跳舞，说正好有蓓莎的竖琴，她又是个少有的好琴手。可是小不点儿说她跳舞的时代已经过去了，我认为那是因为运货夫正在吸一袋烟，而她所最喜欢的是坐在他身旁——在她要装假的时候，她可确实是一个狡猾的装模作样的小家伙呀！费尔丁太太当然只好说她跳舞的时代也过去了。接下来一个个都这么说，只有梅不在此例，梅是准备跳舞的。

于是梅和爱德华站起身来，在大家热烈的掌声中，只有他们一对起舞了，而蓓莎也奏起了她的最动人的调子。

好哇！如果你相信我的话，他们跳了还不到五分钟，运货夫蓦地抛下烟斗，搂着小不点儿的腰，冲到屋子当中，开始和她以极为优美的舞姿跳起来了。泰克尔顿见了立即飞步来到费尔丁太太跟前，搂住她的腰，也照样跳起舞来。老小不点儿见了猛地站起身来，欢蹦乱跳的，一下子便带着老小不点儿太太插进那场舞蹈中间去，而且成了最前面的一组舞伴。凯莱布见了，立即抓住蒂蕾·施罗博埃的双手，一下子冲上舞场；而施罗博埃小姐则坚信所谓跳舞的唯一原则就是在其他一对对的舞伴当中热火朝天地钻过来又钻过去，还和他们冲撞许许多多次。

听啊！那只蟋蟀怎样啾啾、啾啾地参加了那支乐曲；那只水壶也怎样嘶嘶、嘶嘶地欢唱着哪！

可是怎么回事呀！我正愉快地听着，并且向小不点儿转过脸去，对那个我所喜爱的小人儿看上最后一眼，这时候，她和其他一切，刹那间全都消失在空中，只剩下孤零零的我了！有一只蟋蟀在炉边唱着，地上躺着一个破损的儿童玩具，除此以外，其他一切都无影无踪了。





CHIRP THE FIRST


The kettle began it！Don't tell me what Mrs. Peerybingle said.I know better.Mrs.Peerybingle may leave it on record to the end of time that she couldn't say which of them began it；but I say the kettle did.I ought to know, I hope！The kettle began it, full fve minutes by the little waxy-faced Dutch clock in the corner, before the Cricket uttered a chirp.

As if the clock hadn't fnished striking, and the convulsive little Hay-maker at the top of it, jerking away right and left with a scythe in front of a Moorish Palace, hadn't mowed down half an acre of imaginary grass before the Cricket joined in at all！

Why, I am not naturally positive. Every one knows that.I wouldn't set my own opinion against the opinion of Mrs.Peerybingle unless I were quite sure, on any account whatever.Nothing should induce me.But, this is a question of fact.And the fact is, that the kettle began it at least fve minutes before the Cricket gave any sign of being in existence.Contradict me, and I'll say ten.

Let me narrate exactly how it happened. I should have proceededto do so, in my very frst word, but for this plain consideration—if I am to tell a story I must begin at the beginning；and how is it possible to begin at the beginning, without beginning at the kettle?

It appeared as if there were a sort of match, or trial of skill, you must understand, between the kettle and the Cricket. And this is what led to it, and how it came about.

Mrs. Peerybingle, going out into the raw twilight, and clicking over the wet stones in a pair of pattens that worked innumerable rough impressions of the first proposition in Euclid all about the yard—Mrs.Peerybingle flled the kettle at the water butt.Presently returning, less the pattens（and a good deal less, for they were tall, and Mrs.Peerybingle was but short），she set the kettle on the fire.In doing which she lost her temper, or mislaid it for an instant；for, the water being uncomfortably cold, and in that slippy, slushy, sleety sort of state wherein it seems to penetrate through every kind of substance, patten rings included—had laid hold of Mrs.Peerybingle's toes, and even splashed her legs.And when we rather plume ourselves（with reason too）upon our legs, and keep ourselves particularly neat in point of stockings, we fnd this, for the moment, hard to bear.

Besides, the kettle was aggravating and obstinate. It wouldn't allow itself to be adjusted on the top bar；it wouldn't hear of accommodating itself kindly to the knobs of coal；it WOULD lean forward with a drunken air, and dribble, a very Idiot of a kettle, on the hearth.It was quarrelsome, and hissed and spluttered morosely at&nbsp；the fre.To sum up all, the lid, resisting Mrs.Peerybingle's fngers, frst of all turned topsy-turvy, and then, with an ingenious pertinacity deserving of a better cause, dived sideways in—down to the very bottom of the kettle.And the hull of the Royal George has never made half the monstrous resistance to coming out of the water which the lid of that kettle employed against Mrs.Peerybingle before she got it up again.

It looked sullen and pig-headed enough, even then；carrying its handle with an air of defance, and cocking its spout pertly and mockingly at Mrs. Peerybingle, as if it said，“I won't boil.Nothing shall induce me！”

But, Mrs. Peerybingle, with restored good humour, dusted her chubby little hands against each other, and sat down before the kettle laughing.Meantime, the jolly blaze uprose and fell, fashing and gleaming on the little Hay-maker at the top of the Dutch clock, until one might have thought he stood stock-still before the Moorish Palace, and nothing was in motion but the fame.

He was on the move, however；and had his spasms, two to the second, all right and regular. But his sufferings when the clock was going to strike were frightful to behold；and when a Cuckoo looked out of a trap-door in the Palace, and gave note six times, it shook him, each time, like a spectral voice—or like a something wiry plucking at his legs.

It was not until a violent commotion and a whirring noise among the weights and ropes below him had quite subsided thatthis terrifed Hay-maker became himself again. Nor was he startled without reason；for these rattling, bony skeletons of clocks are very disconcerting in their operation, and I wonder very much how any set of men, but most of all how Dutchmen, can have had a liking to invent them.There is a popular belief that Dutchmen love broad cases and much clothing for their own lower selves；and they might know better than to leave their clocks so very lank and unprotected, surely.

Now it was, you observe, that the kettle began to spend the evening. Now it was that the kettle, growing mellow and musical, began to have irrepressible gurglings in its throat, and to indulge in short vocal snorts, which it checked in the bud, as if it hadn't quite made up its mind yet to be good company.Now it was that after two or three such vain attempts to stife its convivial sentiments, it threw off all moroseness, all reserve, and burst into a stream of song so cosy and hilarious as never maudlin nightingale yet formed the least idea of.

So plain, too！Bless you, you might have understood it like a book—better than some books you and I could name, perhaps. With its warm breath gushing forth in a light cloud which merrily and gracefully ascended a few feet, then hung about the chimney corner as its own domestic Heaven, it trolled its song with that strong energy of cheerfulness, that its iron body hummed and stirred upon the fre；and the lid itself, the recently rebellious lid—such is the infuence of a bright example—performed a sort of jig, and clattered like a deaf&nbsp；and dumb young cymbal that had never known the use of its twin brother.

That this song of the kettle's was a song of invitation and welcome to somebody out of doors：to somebody at that moment coming on towards the snug small home and the crisp fre：there is no doubt whatever. Mrs.Peerybingle knew it perfectly, as she sat musing before the hearth.It's a dark night, sang the kettle, and the rotten leaves are lying by the way；and, above, all is mist and darkness, and, below, all is mire and clay；and there's only one relief in all the sad and murky air；and I don't know that it is one, for it's nothing but a glare；of deep and angry crimson, where the sun and wind together；set a brand upon the clouds for being guilty of such weather；and the widest open country is a long dull streak of black；and there’s hoar frost on the fnger-post, and thaw upon the track；and the ice it isn’t water, and the water isn’t free；and you couldn’t say that anything is what it ought to be；but he’s coming, coming, coming！—

And here, if you like, the Cricket DID chime in！with a Chirrup, Chirrup, Chirrup of such magnitude, by way of chorus；with a voice so astoundingly disproportionate to its size, as compared with the kettle；（size！you couldn't see it！）that, if it had then and there burst itself like an overcharged gun, if it had fallen a victim on the spot, and chirruped its little body into ffty pieces, it would have seemed a natural and inevitable consequence, for which it had expressly laboured.

The kettle had had the last of its solo performance. It perseveredwith undiminished ardour；but the Cricket took frst fddle, and kept it.Good Heaven, how it chirped！Its shrill, sharp, piercing voice resounded through the house, and seemed to twinkle in the outer darkness like a star.There was an indescribable little trill and tremble in it at its loudest, which suggested its being carried off its legs, and made to leap again, by its own intense enthusiasm.Yet they went very well together, the Cricket and the kettle.The burden of the song was still the same；and louder, louder, louder still, they sang it in their emulation.

The fair little listener—for fair she was, and young；though something of what is called the dumpling shape；but I don't myself object to that—lighted a candle, glanced at the Hay-maker on the top of the clock, who was getting in a pretty average crop of minutes；and looked out of the window, where she saw nothing, owing to the darkness, but her own face imaged in the glass. And my opinion is（and so would yours have been）that she might have looked a long way and seen nothing half so agreeable.When she came back, and sat down in her former seat, the Cricket and the kettle were still keeping it up, with a perfect fury of competition.The kettle's weak side clearly being that he didn't know when he was beat.

There was all the excitement of a race about it. Chirp, chirp, chirp！Cricket a mile ahead.Hum, hum, hum—m—m！Kettle making play in the distance, like a great top.Chirp, chirp, chirp！Cricket round the corner.Hum, hum, hum—m—m！Kettle sticking to him in his own way；no idea of giving in.Chirp, chirp, chirp！Cricket fresher&nbsp；than ever.Hum, hum, hum—m—m！Kettle slow and steady.Chirp, chirp, chirp！Cricket going in to fnish him.Hum, hum, hum—m—m！Kettle not to be fnished.Until at last they got so jumbled together, in the hurry-skurry, helter-skelter, of the match, that whether the kettle chirped and the Cricket hummed, or the Cricket chirped and the kettle hummed, or they both chirped and both hummed, it would have taken a clearer head than yours or mine to have decided with anything like certainty.But of this there is no doubt：that, the kettle and the Cricket, at one and the same moment, and by some power of amalgamation best known to themselves, sent, each, his freside song of comfort streaming into a ray of the candle that shone out through the window, and a long way down the lane.And this light, bursting on a certain person who, on the instant, approached towards it through the gloom, expressed the whole thing to him, literally in a twinkling, and cried，“Welcome home, old fellow！Welcome home, my boy！”

This end attained, the kettle, being dead beat, boiled over, and was taken off the fire. Mrs.Peerybingle then went running to the door, where, what with the wheels of a cart, the tramp of a horse, the voice of a man, the tearing in and out of an excited dog, and the surprising and mysterious appearance of a baby, there was soon the very What's-his-name to play.

Where the baby came from, or how Mrs. Peerybingle got hold of it in that fash of time, I don't know.But a live baby there was, in Mrs.Peerybingle's arms；and a pretty tolerable amount of prideshe seemed to have in it, when she was drawn gently to the fre, by a sturdy figure of a man, much taller and much older than herself, who had to stoop a long way down to kiss her.But she was worth the trouble.Six foot six, with the lumbago, might have done it.

“Oh goodness, John！”said Mrs. P..“What a state you're in with the weather！”

He was something the worse for it undeniably. The thick mist hung in clots upon his eyelashes like candied thaw；and, between the fog and fre together, there were rainbows in his very whiskers.

“Why, you see, Dot，”John made answer slowly, as he unrolled a shawl from about his throat, and warmed his hands；“it—it an't exactly summer weather. So no wonder.”

“I wish you wouldn't call me Dot, John. I don't like it，”said Mrs.Peerybingle：pouting in a way that clearly showed she DID like it very much.

“Why, what else are you?”returned John, looking down upon her with a smile, and giving her waist as light a squeeze as his huge hand and arm could give.“A dot and”—here he glanced at the baby—“a dot and carry—I won't say it, for fear I should spoil it；but I was very near a joke. I don't know as ever I was nearer.”

He was often near to something or other very clever, by his own account：this lumbering, slow, honest John；this John so heavy, but so light of spirit；so rough upon the surface, but so gentle at the core；so dull without, so quick within；so stolid, but so good！Oh, Mother Nature, give thy children the true poetry of heart that hid itself in this&nbsp；poor Carrier's breast—he was but a Carrier, by the way—and we can bear to have them talking prose, and leading lives of prose；and bear to bless thee for their company！

It was pleasant to see Dot, with her little figure and her baby in her arms—a very doll of a baby—glancing with a coquettish thoughtfulness at the fre, and inclining her delicate little head just enough on one side to let it rest in an odd, half-natural, half-affected, wholly nestling and agreeable manner, on the great rugged fgure of the Carrier. It was pleasant to see him, with his tender awkwardness, endeavouring to adapt his rude support to her slight need, and make his burly middle age a leaning-staff not inappropriate to her blooming youth.It was pleasant to observe how Tilly Slowboy, waiting in the background for the baby, took special cognizance（though in her earliest teens）of this grouping；and stood with her mouth and eyes wide open, and her head thrust forward, taking it in as if it were air.Nor was it less agreeable to observe how John the Carrier, reference being made by Dot to the aforesaid baby, checked his hand when on the point of touching the infant, as if he thought he might crack it；and, bending down, surveyed it from a safe distance, with a kind of puzzled pride, such as an amiable mastiff might be supposed to show if he found himself, one day, the father of a young canary.

“An't he beautiful, John?Don't he look precious in his sleep?”

“Very precious，”said John.“Very much so. He generally is asleep, an't he?”

“Lor, John！Good gracious, no！”

“Oh！”said John, pondering.“I thought his eyes was generally shut. Halloa！”

“Goodness, John, how you startle one！”

“It an't right for him to turn'em up in that way，”said the astonished Carrier，“is it?See how he's winking with both of'em at once！and look at his mouth！Why, he's gasping like a gold and silver fsh！”

“You don't deserve to be a father, you don't，”said Dot, with all the dignity of an experienced matron.“But how should you know what little complaints children are troubled with, John?You wouldn't so much as know their names, you stupid fellow.”And when she had turned the baby over on her left arm, and had slapped its back as a restorative, she pinched her husband's ear, laughing.

“No，”said John, pulling off his outer coat.“It's very true, Dot. I don't know much about it.I only know that I've been fghting pretty stiffly with the wind tonight.It's been blowing north-east, straight into the cart, the whole way home.”

“Poor old man, so it has！”cried Mrs. Peerybingle, instantly becoming very active.“Here, take the precious darling, Tilly, while I make myself of some use.Bless it, I could smother it with kissing it, I could！Hie then, good dog！Hie, Boxer, boy！Only let me make the tea frst, John；and then I'll help you with the parcels, like a busy bee.‘How doth the little'—and all the rest of it, you know, John.Did you ever learn‘How doth the little，'when you went to school, John?”

“Not to quite know it，”John returned.“I was very near it once.&nbsp；But I should only have spoilt it, I dare say.”

“Ha, ha！”laughed Dot. She had the blithest little laugh you ever heard.“What a dear old darling of a dunce you are, John, to be sure！”

Not at all disputing this position, John went out to see that the boy with the lantern, which had been dancing to and fro before the door and window, like a Will of the Wisp, took due care of the horse；who was fatter than you would quite believe, if I gave you his measure, and so old that his birthday was lost in the mists of antiquity. Boxer, feeling that his attentions were due to the family in general, and must be impartially distributed, dashed in and out with bewildering inconstancy；now describing a circle of short barks round the horse, where he was being rubbed down at the stable door；now feigning to make savage rushes at his mistress, and facetiously bringing himself to sudden stops；now eliciting a shriek from Tilly Slowboy, in the low nursing-chair near the fire, by the unexpected application of his moist nose to her countenance；now exhibiting an obtrusive interest in the baby；now going round and round upon the hearth, and lying down as if he had established himself for the night；now getting up again, and taking that nothing of a fag-end of a tail of his out into the weather, as if he had just remembered an appointment, and was off at a round trot, to keep it.

“There！There's the teapot, ready on the hob！”said Dot；as briskly busy as a child at play at keeping house.“And there's the cold knuckle of ham；and there's the butter；and there's the crusty loaf, and all！Here's a clothes basket for the small parcels, John, ifyou’ve got any there. Where are you, John?Don’t let the dear child fall under the grate, Tilly, whatever you do！”

It may be noted of Miss Slowboy, in spite of her rejecting the caution with some vivacity, that she had a rare and surprising talent for getting this baby into diffculties, and had several times imperilled its short life in a quiet way peculiarly her own. She was of a spare and straight shape, this young lady, insomuch that her garments appeared to be in constant danger of sliding off those sharp pegs, her shoulders, on which they were loosely hung.Her costume was remarkable for the partial development, on all possible occasions, of some fannel vestment of a singular structure；also for affording glimpses, in the region of the back, of a corset, or a pair of stays, in colour a dead green.Being always in a state of gaping admiration at everything, and absorbed, besides, in the perpetual contemplation of her mistress's perfections and the baby's, Miss Slowboy, in her little errors of judgment, may be said to have done equal honour to her head and to her heart；and though these did less honour to the baby's head, which they were the occasional means of bringing into contact with deal doors, dressers, stair-rails, bed-posts, and other foreign substances, still they were the honest results of Tilly Slowboy's constant astonishment at finding herself so kindly treated, and installed in such a comfortable home.For the maternal and paternal Slowboy were alike unknown to Fame, and Tilly had been bred by public charity, a foundling；which word, though only differing from fondling by one vowel's length, is very different in meaning, and&nbsp；expresses quite another thing.

To have seen little Mrs. Peerybingle come back with her husband, tugging at the clothes basket, and making the most strenuous exertions to do nothing at all（for he carried it），would have amused you almost as much as it amused him.It may have entertained the Cricket, too, for anything I know；but, certainly, it now began to chirp again, vehemently.

“Heyday！”said John in his slow way.“It's merrier than ever to-night, I think.”

“And it's sure to bring us good fortune, John！It always has done so. To have a Cricket on the Hearth is the luckiest thing in all the world！”

John looked at her as if he had very nearly got the thought into his head that she was his Cricket in chief, and he quite agreed with her. But it was probably one of his narrow escapes, for he said nothing.

“The frst time I heard its cheerful little note, John, was on that night when you brought me home—when you brought me to my new home here；its little mistress. Nearly a year ago.You recollect, John?”

Oh, yes！John remembered. I should think so！

“Its chirp was such a welcome to me！It seemed so full of promise and encouragement. It seemed to say, you would be kind and gentle with me, and would not expect（I had a fear of that, John, then）to fnd an old head on the shoulders of your foolish little wife.”John thoughtfully patted one of the shoulders, and then the head, as though he would have said No, no；he had had no such expectation；he had been quite content to take them as they were.And really he had reason.They were very comely.

“It spoke the truth, John, when it seemed to say so, for you have ever been, I am sure, the best, the most considerate, the most affectionate of husbands to me. This has been a happy home, John；and I love the Cricket for its sake！”

“Why, so do I, then，”said the Carrier.“So do I, Dot.”

“I love it for the many times I have heard it, and the many thoughts its harmless music has given me. Sometimes, in the twilight, when I have felt a little solitary and down-hearted, John—before baby was here, to keep me company and make the house gay—when I have thought how lonely you would be if I should die；how lonely I should be, if I could know that you had lost me, dear；its Chirp, Chirp, Chirp upon the hearth has seemed to tell me of another little voice, so sweet, so very dear to me, before whose coming sound my trouble vanished like a dream.And when I used to fear—I did fear once, John；I was very young, you know—that ours might prove to be an ill-assorted marriage, I being such a child, and you more like my guardian than my husband；and that you might not, however hard you tried, be able to learn to love me, as you hoped and prayed you might；its Chirp, Chirp, Chirp has cheered me up again, and filled me with new trust and confdence.I was thinking of these things to-night, dear, when I sat expecting you；and I love the Cricket for their&nbsp；sake！”

“And so do I，”repeated John.“But, Dot！I hope and pray that I might learn to love you?How you talk！I had learnt that long before I brought you here, to be the Cricket's little mistress, Dot！”

She laid her hand, an instant, on his arm, and looked up at him with an agitated face, as if she would have told him something. Next moment, she was down upon her knees before the basket；speaking in a sprightly voice, and busy with the parcels.

“There are not many of them tonight, John, but I saw some goods behind the cart just now；and though they give more trouble, perhaps, still they pay as well；so we have no reason to grumble, have we?Besides, you have been delivering, I dare say, as you came along?”

“Oh, yes！”John said.“A good many.”

“Why, what's this round box?Heart alive, John, it's a wedding-cake！”

“Leave a woman alone to fnd out that，”said John admiringly.“Now, a man would never have thought of it！Whereas, it's my belief that if you was to pack a wedding-cake up in a tea-chest, or a turn-up bedstead, or a pickled-salmon keg, or any unlikely thing, a woman would be sure to fnd it out directly. Yes；I called for it at the pastrycook's.”

“And it weighs I don't know what—whole hundredweights！”cried Dot, making a great demonstration of trying to lift it.“Whose is it, John?Where is it going?”

“Read the writing on the other side，”said John.

“Why, John！My Goodness, John！”

“Ah！who'd have thought it?”John returned.

“You never mean to say，”pursued Dot, sitting on the floor and shaking her head at him，“that it's Gruff and Tackleton the toymaker！”

John nodded.

Mrs. Peerybingle nodded also, fifty times at least.Not in assent—in dumb and pitying amazement；screwing up her lips, the while, with all their little force（they were never made for screwing up；I am clear of that），and looking the good Carrier through and through, in her abstraction.Miss Slowboy, in the meantime, who had a mechanical power of reproducing scraps of current conversation for the delectation of the baby, with all the sense struck out of them, and all the nouns changed into the plural number, inquired aloud of that young creature, Was it Gruffs and Tackletons the toymakers then, and Would it call at Pastrycooks for wedding-cakes, and Did its mothers know the boxes when its fathers brought them home；and so on.

“And that is really to come about！”said Dot.“Why, she and I were girls at school together, John.”

He might have been thinking of her, or nearly thinking of her, perhaps, as she was in that same school-time. He looked upon her with a thoughtful pleasure, but he made no answer.

“And he's as old！As unlike her！—Why, how many years older than you, is Gruff and Tackleton, John?”

“How many more cups of tea shall I drink tonight, at one sitting, than Gruff and Tackleton ever took in four, I wonder！”replied John good-humouredly, as he drew a chair to the round table, and began at the cold ham.“As to eating, I eat but little；but that little I enjoy, Dot.”

Even this, his usual sentiment at meal-times, one of his innocent delusions（for his appetite was always obstinate, and fatly contradicted him），awoke no smile in the face of his little wife, who stood among the parcels, pushing the cake-box slowly from her with her foot, and never once looked, though her eyes were cast down too, upon the dainty shoe she generally was so mindful of. Absorbed in thought, she stood there, heedless alike of the tea and John（although he called to her and rapped the table with his knife to startle her），until he rose and touched her on the arm；when she looked at him for a moment, and hurried to her place behind the tea-board, laughing at her negligence.But not as she had laughed before.The manner and the music were quite changed.

The Cricket, too, had stopped. Somehow, the room was not so cheerful as it had been.Nothing like it.

“So, these are all the parcels, are they, John?”she said, breaking a long silence, which the honest Carrier had devoted to the practical illustration of one part of his favourite sentiment—certainly enjoying what he ate, if it couldn't be admitted that he ate but little.“So these are all the parcels, are they, John?”

“That's all，”said John.“Why—no—I”—laying down his knifeand fork, and taking a long breath—“I declare—I've clean forgotten the old gentleman！”

“The old gentleman?”

“In the cart，”said John.“He was asleep among the straw, the last time I saw him. I've very nearly remembered him, twice, since I came in；but he went out of my head again.Halloa！Yahip there！Rouse up！That's my hearty！”

John said these latter words outside the door, whither he had hurried with the candle in his hand.

Miss Slowboy, conscious of some mysterious reference to The Old Gentleman, and connecting, in her mystifed imagination, certain associations of a religious nature with the phrase, was so disturbed, that hastily rising from the low chair by the fre to seek protection near the skirt of her mistress, and coming into contact, as she crossed the doorway, with an ancient Stranger, she instinctively made a charge or butt at him with the only offensive instrument within her reach. This instrument happening to be the baby, great commotion and alarm ensued, which the sagacity of Boxer rather tended to increase；for that good dog, more thoughtful than his master, had, it seemed, been watching the old gentleman in his sleep, lest he should walk off with a few young poplar-trees that were tied up behind the cart；and he still attended on him very closely, worrying his gaiters, in fact, and making dead sets at the buttons.

“You're such an undeniably good sleeper, sir，”said John, when tranquillity was restored（in the meantime the old gentleman had&nbsp；stood, bareheaded and motionless, in the centre of the room），“that I have half a mind to ask you where the other six are—only that would be a joke, and I know I should spoil it. Very near, though，”murmured the Carrier with a chuckle；“very near！”

The Stranger, who had long white hair, good features, singularly bold and well defned for an old man, and dark, bright, penetrating eyes, looked round with a smile, and saluted the Carrier's wife by gravely inclining his head.

His garb was very quaint and odd—a long, long way behind the time. Its hue was brown, all over.In his hand he held a great brown club or walking-stick；and, striking this upon the foor, it fell asunder, and became a chair.On which he sat down quite composedly.

“There！”said the Carrier, turning to his wife.“That's the way I found him, sitting by the roadside！Upright as a milestone. And almost as deaf.”

“Sitting in the open air, John?”

“In the open air，”replied the Carrier，“just at dusk.‘Carriage Paid，'he said；and gave me eighteen-pence. Then he got in.And there he is.”

“He's going, John, I think！”

Not at all. He was only going to speak.

“If you please, I was to be left till called for，”said the Stranger mildly.“Don't mind me.”

With that he took a pair of spectacles from one of his large pockets, and a book from another, and leisurely began to read. Making no more of Boxer than if he had been a house lamb！

The Carrier and his wife exchanged a look of perplexity. The Stranger raised his head；and, glancing from the latter to the former, said：

“Your daughter, my good friend?”

“Wife，”returned John.

“Niece?”said the Stranger.

“Wife！”roared John.

“Indeed?”observed the Stranger.“Surely?Very young！”

He quietly turned over, and resumed his reading. But, before he could have read two lines, he again interrupted himself to say：

“Baby yours?”

John gave him a gigantic nod：equivalent to an answer in the affrmative, delivered through a speaking trumpet.

“Girl?”

“Bo-o-oy！”roared John.

“Also very young, eh?”

Mrs. Peerybingle instantly struck in.“Two months and three da-ays.Vaccinated just six weeks ago-o！Took very fne-ly！Considered, by the doctor, a remarkably beautiful chi-ild！Equal to the general run of children at fve months o-ld！Takes notice in a way quite wonder-ful！May seem impossible to you, but feels his legs al-ready！”

Here, the breathless little mother, who had been shrieking these short sentences into the old man's ear, until her pretty face was crimsoned, held up the Baby before him as a stubborn and triumphant&nbsp；fact；while Tilly Slowboy, with a melodious cry of“Ketcher, Ketcher”—which sounded like some unknown words, adapted to a popular Sneeze—performed some cow-like gambols around that all unconscious Innocent.

“Hark！He's called for, sure enough，”said John.“There's somebody at the door. Open it, Tilly.”

Before she could reach it, however, it was opened from without；being a primitive sort of door, with a latch that any one could lift if he chose—and a good many people did choose, for all kinds of neighbours liked to have a cheerful word or two with the Carrier, though he was no great talker himself. Being opened, it gave admission to a little, meagre, thoughtful, dingy-faced man, who seemed to have made himself a great-coat from the sackcloth covering of some old box；for, when he turned to shut the door and keep the weather out, he disclosed upon the back of that garment the inscription G&T in large black capitals.Also the word GLASS in bold characters.

“Good evening, John！”said the little man.“Good evening, mum！Good evening, Tilly！Good evening, Unbeknown！How's Baby, mum?Boxer's pretty well I hope?”

“All thriving, Caleb，”replied Dot.“I am sure you need only look at the dear child, for one, to know that.”

“And I'm sure I need only look at you for another，”said Caleb.

He didn't look at her, though；he had a wandering and thoughtful eye, which seemed to be always projecting itself into some other time&nbsp；and place, no matter what he said；a description which will equally apply to his voice.

“Or at John for another，”said Caleb.“Or at Tilly, as far as that goes. Or certainly at Boxer.”

“Busy just now, Caleb?”asked the Carrier.

“Why, pretty well, John，”he returned, with the distraught air of a man who was casting about for the Philosopher's stone, at least.“Pretty much so. There's rather a run on Noah's Arks at present.I could have wished to improve on the Family, but I don't see how it's to be done at the price.It would be a satisfaction to one’s mind to make it clearer which was Shems and Hams, and which was Wives.Flies an’t on that scale, neither, as compared with elephants, you know！Ah, well！Have you got anything in the parcel line for me, John?”

The Carrier put his hand into a pocket of the coat he had taken off；and brought out, carefully preserved in moss and paper, a tiny fower-pot.

“There it is！”he said, adjusting it with great care.“Not so much as a leaf damaged. Full of buds！”

Caleb's dull eye brightened as he took it, and thanked him.

“Dear, Caleb，”said the Carrier.“Very dear at this season.”

“Never mind that. It would be cheap to me, what ever it cost，”returned the little man.“Anything else, John?”

“A small box，”replied the Carrier.“Here you are！”

“‘For Caleb Plummer，'”said the little man, spelling out the&nbsp；direction.“‘With Cash.'With Cash, John?I don't think it's for me.”

“With Care，”returned the Carrier, looking over his shoulder.“Where do you make out cash?”

“Oh！To be sure！”said Caleb.“It's all right. With care！Yes, yes；that's mine.It might have been with cash, indeed, if my dear Boy in the Golden South Americas had lived, John.You loved him like a son；didn't you?You needn't say you did.I know, of course.‘Caleb Plummer.With care.'Yes, yes, it’s all right.It’s a box of dolls’eyes for my daughters’work.I wish it was her own sight in a box, John.”

“I wish it was, or could be！”cried the Carrier.

“Thankee，”said the little man.“You speak very hearty. To think that she should never see the Dolls—and them a staring at her, so bold, all day long！That's where it cuts.What's the damage, John?”

“I'll damage you，”said John，“if you inquire. Dot！Very near?”

“Well！it's like you to say so，”observed the little man.“It's your kind way. Let me see.I think that's all.”

“I think not，”said the Carrier.“Try again.”

“Something for our Governor, eh?”said Caleb after pondering a little while.“To be sure. That's what I came for；but my head's so running on them Arks and things！He hasn't been here, has he?”

“Not he，”returned the Carrier.“He's too busy, courting.”

“He's coming round, though，”said Caleb；“for he told me to keep on the near side of the road going home, and it was ten to one he'd take me up. I had better go, by-the-bye.—You couldn't have the goodness to let me pinch Boxer's tail, mum, for half a moment, couldyou?”

“Why, Caleb, what a question！”

“Oh, never mind, mum！”said the little man.“He mightn't like it, perhaps. There's a small order just come in for barking dogs；and I should wish to go as close to Natur'as I could for sixpence.That's all.Never mind, mum.”

It happened opportunely that Boxer, without receiving the proposed stimulus, began to bark with great zeal. But, as this implied the approach of some new visitor, Caleb, postponing his study from the life to a more convenient season, shouldered the round box, and took a hurried leave.He might have spared himself the trouble, for he met the visitor upon the threshold.

“Oh！You are here, are you?Wait a bit. I'll take you home.John Peerybingle, my service to you.More of my service to your pretty wife.Handsomer every day！Better too, if possible！And younger，”mused the speaker in a low voice，“that's the devil of it！”

“I should be astonished at your paying compliments, Mr. Tackleton，”said Dot, not with the best grace in the world，“but for your condition.”

“You know all about it, then?”

“I have got myself to believe it somehow，”said Dot.

“After a hard struggle, I suppose?”

“Very.”

Tackleton the Toy merchant, pretty generally known as Gruff and Tackleton—for that was the firm, though Gruff had been&nbsp；bought out long ago；only leaving his name, and, as some said, his nature, according to its Dictionary meaning, in the business—Tackleton the Toy merchant was a man whose vocation had been quite misunderstood by his Parents and Guardians. If they had made him a Money Lender, or a sharp Attorney, or a Sheriff's Offcer, or a Broker, he might have sown his discontented oats in his youth, and, after having had the full run of himself in ill-natured transactions, might have turned out amiable, at last, for the sake of a little freshness and novelty.But, cramped and chafing in the peaceable pursuit of toymaking, he was a domestic Ogre, who had been living on children all his life, and was their implacable enemy.He despised all toys；wouldn't have bought one for the world；delighted, in his malice, to insinuate grim expressions into the faces of brown-paper farmers who drove pigs to market, bellmen who advertised lost lawyers'consciences, movable old ladies who darned stockings or carved pies；and other like samples of his stock-in-trade.In appalling masks；hideous, hairy, red-eyed Jacks in Boxes；Vampire Kites；demoniacal Tumblers who wouldn't lie down, and were perpetually fying forward, to stare infants out of countenance；his soul perfectly revelled.They were his only relief, and safety-valve.He was great in such inventions.Anything suggestive of a Pony nightmare was delicious to him.He had even lost money（and he took to that toy very kindly）by getting up Goblin slides for magic lanterns, whereon the Powers of Darkness were depicted as a sort of supernatural shell-fish, with human faces.In intensifying the portraiture of Giants, he had sunk quite a little capital；and, though no painter himself, he could indicate, for the instruction of his artists, with a piece of chalk, a certain furtive leer for the countenances of those monsters, which was safe to destroy the peace of mind of any young gentleman between the ages of six and eleven, for the whole Christmas or Midsummer Vacation.

What he was in toys, he was（as most men are）in other things. You may easily suppose, therefore, that within the great green cape, which reached down to the calves of his legs, there was buttoned up to the chin an uncommonly pleasant fellow；and that he was about as choice a spirit, and as agreeable a companion, as ever stood in a pair of bull-headed-looking boots with mahogany-coloured tops.

Still, Tackleton, the toy merchant, was going to be married. In spite of all this, he was going to be married.And to a young wife too, a beautiful young wife.

He didn't look much like a Bridegroom, as he stood in the Carrier's kitchen, with a twist in his dry face, and a screw in his body, and his hat jerked over the bridge of his nose, and his hands tucked down into the bottoms of his pockets, and his whole sarcastic, ill-conditioned self peering out of one little corner of one little eye, like the concentrated essence of any number of ravens. But a Bridegroom he designed to be.

“In three days'time. Next Thursday.The last day of the first month in the year.That's my wedding-day，”said Tackleton.

Did I mention that he had always one eye wide open, and one&nbsp；eye nearly shut；and that the one eye nearly shut was always the expressive eye?I don't think I did.

“That's my wedding-day！”said Tackleton, rattling his money.

“Why, it's our wedding-day too，”exclaimed the Carrier.

“Ha, ha！”laughed Tackleton.“Odd！You're just such another couple. Just！”

The indignation of Dot at this presumptuous assertion is not to be described. What next?His imagination would compass the possibility of just such another Baby, perhaps.The man was mad.

“I say！A word with you，”murmured Tackleton, nudging the Carrier with his elbow, and taking him a little apart.“You'll come to the wedding?We're in the same boat, you know.”

“How in the same boat?”inquired the Carrier.

“A little disparity, you know，”said Tackleton with another nudge.“Come and spend an evening with us beforehand.”

“Why?”demanded John, astonished at this pressing hospitality.

“Why?”returned the other.“That's a new way of receiving an invitation. Why, for pleasure—sociability, you know, and all that.”

“I thought you were never sociable，”said John in his plain way.

“Tchah！It's of no use to be anything but free with you, I see，”said Tackleton.“Why, then, the truth is, you have a—what tea-drinking people call a sort of a comfortable appearance together, you and your wife. We know better, you know, but—”

“No, we don't know better，”interposed John.“What are you talking about?”

“Well！We don't know better, then，”said Tackleton.“We'll agree that we don't. As you like；what does it matter?I was going to say, as you have that sort of appearance, your company will produce a favourable effect on Mrs.Tackleton that will be.And, though I don't think your good lady's very friendly to me in this matter, still she can’t help herself from falling into my views, for there’s a compactness and cosiness of appearance about her that always tells, even in an indifferent case.You’ll say you’ll come?”

“We have arranged to keep our Wedding-day（as far as that goes）at home，”said John.“We have made the promise to ourselves these six months. We think, you see, that home—”

“Bah！what's home?”cried Tackleton.“Four walls and a ceiling！（Why don't you kill that Cricket?I would！I always do. I hate their noise.）There are four walls and a ceiling at my house.Come to me！”

“You kill your Crickets, eh?”said John.

“Scrunch'em, sir，”returned the other, setting his heel heavily on the foor.“You'll say you'll come?It's as much your interest as mine, you know, that the women should persuade each other that they're quiet and contented, and couldn’t be better off. I know their way.Whatever one woman says, another woman is determined to clinch always.There’s that spirit of emulation among’em, sir, that if your wife says to my wife，‘I’m the happiest woman in the world, and mine’s the best husband in the world, and I dote on him，’my wife will say the same to yours, or more, and half believe it.”

“Do you mean to say she don't, then?”asked the Carrier.

“Don't！”cried Tackleton with a short, sharp laugh.“Don't what?”

The Carrier had some faint idea of adding，“dote upon you.”But, happening to meet the half-closed eye, as it twinkled upon him over the turned-up collar of the cape, which was within an ace of poking it out, he felt it such an unlikely part and parcel of anything to be doted on, that he substituted，“that she don't believe it?”

“Ah, you dog！You're joking，”said Tackleton.

But the Carrier, though slow to understand the full drift of his meaning, eyed him in such a serious manner, that he was obliged to be a little more explanatory.

“I have the humour，”said Tackleton：holding up the fingers of his left hand, and tapping the forefinger, to imply，“There I am, Tackleton to wit：”“I have the humour, sir, to marry a young wife, and a pretty wife：”here he rapped his little finger, to express the Bride；not sparingly, but sharply；with a sense of power.“I'm able to gratify that humour, and I do. It's my whim.But—now look there！”

He pointed to where Dot was sitting, thoughtfully before the fre：leaning her dimpled chin upon her hand, and watching the bright blaze. The Carrier looked at her, and then at him, and then at her, and then at him again.

“She honours and obeys, no doubt, you know，”said Tackleton；“and that, as I am not a man of sentiment, is quite enough for me. But do you think there's anything more in it?”

“I think，”observed the Carrier，“that I should chuck any manout of window who said there wasn't.”

“Exactly so，”returned the other with an unusual alacrity of assent.“To be sure！Doubtless you would. Of course.I'm certain of it.Good night.Pleasant dreams！”

The Carrier was puzzled, and made uncomfortable and uncertain, in spite of himself. He couldn't help showing it in his manner.

“Good night, my dear friend！”said Tackleton compassionately.“I'm off. We're exactly alike in reality, I see.You won't give us to-morrow evening?Well！Next day you go out visiting, I know.I'll meet you there, and bring my wife that is to be.It'll do her good.You’re agreeable?Thankee.What’s that?”

It was a loud cry from the Carrier's wife：a loud, sharp, sudden cry, that made the room ring like a glass vessel. She had risen from her seat, and stood like one transfixed by terror and surprise.The Stranger had advanced towards the fre to warm himself, and stood within a short stride of her chair.But quite still.

“Dot！”cried the Carrier.“Mary！Darling！What's the matter?”

They were all about her in a moment. Caleb, who had been dozing on the cake-box, in the first imperfect recovery of his suspended presence of mind, seized Miss Slowboy by the hair of her head, but immediately apologised.

“Mary！”exclaimed the Carrier, supporting her in his arms.“Are you ill?What is it?Tell me dear！”

She only answered by beating her hands together, and falling&nbsp；into a wild fit of laughter. Then, sinking from his grasp upon the ground, she covered her face with her apron, and wept bitterly.And then, she laughed again, and then she cried again, and then she said how cold she was, and suffered him to lead her to the fre, where she sat down as before.The old man standing, as before, quite still.

“I'm better, John，”she said.“I'm quite well now—I—”

“John！”But John was on the other side of her. Why turn her face towards the strange old gentleman, as if addressing him.Was her brain wandering?

“Only a fancy, John dear—a kind of shock—a something coming suddenly before my eyes—I don't know what it was. It's quite gone, quite gone.”

“I'm glad it's gone，”muttered Tackleton, turning the expressive eye all round the room.“I wonder where it's gone, and what it was. Humph！Caleb, come here！Who's that with the grey hair?”

“I don't know, sir，”returned Caleb in a whisper.“Never see him before in all my life. A beautiful fgure for a nut-cracker；quite a new model.With a screw-jaw opening down into his waistcoat, he'd be lovely.”

“Not ugly enough，”said Tackleton.

“Or for a fre-box either，”observed Caleb in deep contemplation，“what a model！Unscrew his head to put the matches in；turn him heels up'ards for the light；and what a fire-box for a gentleman's mantel-shelf, just as he stands！”

“Not half ugly enough，”said Tackleton.“Nothing in him at all. Come！Bring that box！All right now, I hope?”

“Oh, quite gone！Quite gone！”said the little woman, waving him hurriedly away.“Good night！”

“Good night！”said Tackleton.“Good night, John Peerybingle！Take care how you carry that box, Caleb. Let it fall, and I'll murder you！Dark as pitch, and weather worse than ever, eh?Good night！”

So, with another sharp look round the room, he went out at the door；followed by Caleb with the wedding-cake on his head.

The Carrier had been so much astounded by his little wife, and so busily engaged in soothing and tending her, that he had scarcely been conscious of the Stranger's presence until now, when he again stood there, their only guest.

“He don't belong to them, you see，”said John.“I must give him a hint to go.”

“I beg your pardon, friend，”said the old gentleman, advancing to him；“the more so as I fear your wife has not been well；but the Attendant whom my infrmity，”he touched his ears, and shook his head，“renders almost indispensable, not having arrived, I fear there must be some mistake. The bad night which made the shelter of your comfortable cart（may I never have a worse！）so acceptable, is still as bad as ever.Would you, in your kindness, suffer me to rent a bed here?”

“Yes, yes，”cried Dot.“Yes！Certainly！”

“Oh！”said the Carrier, surprised by the rapidity of this consent.“Well！I don't object；but still I'm not quite sure that—”

“Hush！”she interrupted.“Dear John！”

“Why, he's stone deaf，”urged John.

“I know he is, but—Yes, sir, certainly. Yes, certainly！I'll make him up a bed directly, John.”

As she hurried off to do it, the flutter of her spirits, and the agitation of her manner, were so strange, that the Carrier stood looking after her, quite confounded.

“Did its mothers make it up a Beds, then！”cried Miss Slowboy to the Baby；“and did its hair grow brown and curly when its caps was lifted off, and frighten it, a precious Pets, a sitting by the fres！”

With that unaccountable attraction of the mind to trifes, which is often incidental to a state of doubt and confusion, the Carrier, as he walked slowly to and fro, found himself mentally repeating even these absurd words, many times. So many times, that he got them by heart, and was still conning them over and over, like a lesson, when Tilly, after administering as much friction to the little bald head with her hand as she thought wholesome（according to the practice of nurses），had once more tied the Baby's cap on.

“And frighten it, a precious Pets, a sitting by the fires. What frightened Dot, I wonder?”mused the Carrier, pacing to and fro.

He scouted, from his heart, the insinuations of the toy merchant, and yet they filled him with a vague, indefinite uneasiness. For Tackleton was quick and sly；and he had that painful sense, himself, of being a man of slow perception, that a broken hint was always worrying to him.He certainly had no intention in his mind of linkinganything that Tackleton had said with the unusual conduct of his wife, but the two subjects of refection came into his mind together, and he could not keep them asunder.

The bed was soon made ready；and the visitor, declining all refreshment but a cup of tea, retired. Then, Dot—quite well again, she said, quite well again—arranged the great chair in the chimney-corner for her husband；flled his pipe and gave it him；and took her usual little stool beside him on the hearth.

She always would sit on that little stool. I think she must have had a kind of notion that it was a coaxing, wheedling little stool.

She was, out and out, the very best filler of a pipe, I should say, in the four quarters of the globe. To see her put that chubby little finger in the bowl, and then blow down the pipe to clear the tube, and, when she had done so, affect to think that there was really something in the tube, and blow a dozen times, and hold it to her eye like a telescope, with a most provoking twist in her capital little face, as she looked down it, was quite a brilliant thing.As to the tobacco, she was perfect mistress of the subject；and her lighting of the pipe, with a wisp of paper, when the Carrier had it in his mouth—going so very near his nose, and yet not scorching it—was Art, high Art.

And the Cricket and the Kettle, turning up again, acknowledged it！The bright fire, blazing up again, acknowledged it！The little Mower on the clock, in his unheeded work, acknowledged it！The Carrier, in his smoothing forehead and expanding face, acknowledged it, the readiest of all.

And as he soberly and thoughtfully puffed at his old pipe, and as the Dutch clock ticked, and as the red fire gleamed, and as the Cricket chirped, that Genius of his Hearth and Home（for such the Cricket was）came out, in fairy shape, into the room, and summoned many forms of Home about him. Dots of all ages and all sizes flled the chamber.Dots who were merry children, running on before him, gathering flowers in the fields；coy Dots, half shrinking from, half yielding to, the pleading of his own rough image；newly-married Dots, alighting at the door, and taking wondering possession of the household keys；motherly little Dots, attended by fictitious Slowboys, bearing babies to be christened；matronly Dots, still young and blooming, watching Dots of daughters, as they danced at rustic balls；fat Dots, encircled and beset by troops of rosy grandchildren；withered Dots, who leaned on sticks, and tottered as they crept along.Old Carriers, too, appeared with blind old Boxers lying at their feet；and newer carts with younger drivers（“Peerybingle Brothers”on the tilt）；and sick old Carriers, tended by the gentlest hands；and graves of dead and gone old Carriers, green in the churchyard.And as the Cricket showed him all these things—he saw them plainly, though his eyes were fxed upon the fre—the Carrier's heart grew light and happy, and he thanked his Household Gods with all his might, and cared no more for Gruff and Tackleton than you do.

But what was that young fgure of a man, which the same Fairy Cricket set so near Her stool, and which remained there, singly andalone?Why did it linger still, so near her, with its arm upon the chimney-piece, ever repeating“Married！and not to me！”

Oh, Dot！Oh, failing Dot！There is no place for it in all your husband's visions. Why has its shadow fallen on his hearth?





CHIRP THE SECOND


Caleb Plummer and his Blind Daughter lived all alone by themselves, as the Story Books say—and my blessing, with yours, to back it I hope, on the Story Books, for saying anything in this work-a-day world！—Caleb Plummer and his Blind Daughter lived all alone by themselves, in a little cracked nutshell of a wooden house, which was, in truth, no better than a pimple on the prominent red-brick nose of Gruff and Tackleton. The premises of Gruff and Tackleton were the great feature of the street；but you might have knocked down Caleb Plummer's dwelling with a hammer or two, and carried off the pieces in a cart.

If any one had done the dwelling-house of Caleb Plummer the honour to miss it after such an inroad, it would have been, no doubt, to commend its demolition as a vast improvement. It stuck to the premises of Gruff and Tackleton like a barnacle to a ship's keel, or a snail to a door, or a little bunch of toadstools to the stem of a tree.But it was the germ from which the full-grown trunk of Gruff and Tackleton had sprung；and, under its crazy roof, the Gruff before lasthad, in a small way, made toys for a generation of old boys and girls, who had played with them, and found them out, and broken them, and gone to sleep.

I have said that Caleb and his poor Blind Daughter lived here. I should have said that Caleb lived here, and his poor Blind Daughter somewhere else—in an enchanted home of Caleb's furnishing, where scarcity and shabbiness were not, and trouble never entered.Caleb was no sorcerer；but in the only magic art that still remains to us, the magic of devoted, deathless love, Nature had been the mistress of his study；and, from her teaching, all the wonder came.

The Blind Girl never knew that ceilings were discoloured, walls blotched and bare of plaster here and there, high crevices unstopped and widening every day, beams mouldering and tending downward. The Blind Girl never knew that iron was rusting, wood rotting, paper peeling off；the size, and shape, and true proportion of the dwelling, withering away.The Blind Girl never knew that ugly shapes of delf and earthenware were on the board；that sorrow and faint-heartedness were in the house；that Caleb's scanty hairs were turning greyer and more grey before her sightless face.The Blind Girl never knew they had a master, cold, exacting, and uninterested—never knew that Tackleton was Tackleton, in short；but lived in the belief of an eccentric humorist, who loved to have his jest with them, and who, while he was the Guardian Angel of their lives, disdained to hear one word of thankfulness.

And all was Caleb's doing；all the doing of her simple father！&nbsp；But he, too, had a Cricket on his Hearth；and listening sadly to its music when the motherless Blind Child was very young that Spirit had inspired him with the thought that even her great deprivation might be almost changed into a blessing, and the girl made happy by these little means. For all the Cricket tribe are potent Spirits, even though the people who hold converse with them do not know it（which is frequently the case），and there are not in the unseen world voices more gentle and more true, that may be so implicitly relied on, or that are so certain to give none but tenderest counsel, as the Voices in which the Spirits of the Fireside and the Hearth address themselves to humankind.

Caleb and his daughter were at work together in their usual working-room, which served them for their ordinary living-room as well；and a strange place it was. There were houses in it, fnished and unfnished, for Dolls of all stations in life.Suburban tenements for Dolls of moderate means；kitchens and single apartments for Dolls of the lower classes；capital town residences for Dolls of high estate.Some of these establishments were already furnished according to estimate, with a view to the convenience of Dolls of limited income；others could be fitted on the most expensive scale, at a moment's notice, from whole shelves of chairs and tables, sofas, bedsteads, and upholstery.The nobility and gentry and public in general, for whose accommodation these tenements were designed, lay here and there, in baskets, staring straight up at the ceiling；but in denoting their degrees in society, and confining them to their respective stations（which experience shows to be lamentably diffcult in real life），the makers of these Dolls had far improved on Nature, who is often froward and perverse；for they, not resting on such arbitrary marks as satin, cotton print, and bits of rag, had superadded striking personal differences which allowed of no mistake.Thus, the Doll-lady of distinction had wax limbs of perfect symmetry；but only she and her compeers.The next grade in the social scale being made of leather, and the next of coarse linen stuff.As to the common people, they had just so many matches out of tinder-boxes for their arms and legs, and there they were—established in their sphere at once, beyond the possibility of getting out of it.

There were various other samples of his handicraft besides Dolls in Caleb Plummer's room. There were Noah's arks, in which the Birds and Beasts were an uncommonly tight fit, I assure you；though they could be crammed in, anyhow, at the roof, and rattled and shaken into the smallest compass.By a bold poetical licence, most of these Noah's arks had knockers on the doors；inconsistent appendages, perhaps, as suggestive of morning callers and a Postman, yet a pleasant fnish to the outside of the building.There were scores of melancholy little carts, which, when the wheels went round, performed most doleful music.Many small fiddles, drums, and other instruments of torture；no end of cannon, shields, swords, spears, and guns.There were little tumblers in red breeches, incessantly swarming up high obstacles of red tape, and coming down, head frst, on the other side；and there were innumerable old&nbsp；gentlemen of respectable, not to say venerable appearance, insanely flying over horizontal pegs, inserted, for the purpose, in their own street-doors.There were beasts of all sorts；horses, in particular, of every breed, from the spotted barrel on four pegs with a small tippet for a mane, to the thorough-bred rocker on his highest mettle.As it would have been hard to count the dozens upon dozens of grotesque fgures that were ever ready to commit all sorts of absurdities on the turning of a handle, so it would have been no easy task to mention any human folly, vice, or weakness that had not its type, immediate or remote, in Caleb Plummer's room.And not in an exaggerated form, for very little handles will move men and women to as strange performances as any Toy was ever made to undertake.

In the midst of all these objects, Caleb and his daughter sat at work. The Blind Girl busy as a Doll's dressmaker；Caleb painting and glazing the four-pair front of a desirable family mansion.

The care imprinted in the lines of Caleb's face, and his absorbed and dreamy manner, which would have sat well on some alchemist or abstruse student, were at frst sight an odd contrast to his occupation and the trivialities about him. But trivial things, invented and pursued for bread, become very serious matters of fact：and, apart from this consideration, I am not at all prepared to say, myself, that if Caleb had been a Lord Chamberlain, or a Member of Parliament, or a lawyer, or even a great speculator, he would have dealt in toys one whit less whimsical, while I have a very great doubt whether they would have been as harmless.

“So you were out in the rain last night, father, in your beautiful new great-coat，”said Caleb's daughter.

“In my beautiful new great-coat，”answered Caleb, glancing towards a clothes-line in the room, on which the sackcloth garment previously described was carefully hung up to dry.

“How glad I am you bought it, father！”

“And of such a tailor too，”said Caleb.“Quite a fashionable tailor. It's too good for me.”

The Blind Girl rested from her work, and laughed with delight.

“Too good, father！What can be too good for you?”

“I'm half ashamed to wear it, though，”said Caleb, watching the effect of what he said upon her brightening face，“upon my word！When I hear the boys and people say behind me，‘Halloa！Here's a swell！'I don't know which way to look. And when the beggar wouldn't go away last night；and, when I said I was a very common man, said，‘No, your Honour！Bless your Honour, don’t say that！’I was quite ashamed.I really felt as if I hadn’t a right to wear it.”

Happy Blind Girl！How merry she was in her exultation！

“I see you, father，”she said, clasping her hands，“as plainly as if I had the eyes I never want when you are with me. A blue coat—”

“Bright blue，”said Caleb.

“Yes, yes！Bright blue！”exclaimed the girl, turning up her radiant face；“the colour I can just remember in the blessed sky！You told me it was blue before！A bright blue coat—”

“Made loose to the fgure，”suggested Caleb.

“Yes！loose to the figure！”cried the Blind Girl, laughing heartily；“and in it, you, dear father, with your merry eye, your smiling face, your free step, and your dark hair—looking so young and handsome！”

“Halloa！Halloa！”said Caleb.“I shall be vain presently！”

“I think you are already，”cried the Blind Girl, pointing at him in her glee.“I know you, father！Ha, ha, ha！I've found you out, you see！”

How different the picture in her mind, from Caleb, as he sat observing her！She had spoken of his free step. She was right in that.For years and years he had never once crossed that threshold at his own slow pace, but with a footfall counterfeited for her ear；and never had he, when his heart was heaviest, forgotten the light tread that was to render hers so cheerful and courageous！

Heaven knows！But I think Caleb's vague bewilderment of manner may have half originated in his having confused himself about himself and everything around him, for the love of his Blind Daughter. How could the little man be otherwise than bewildered, after labouring for so many years to destroy his own identity, and that of all the objects that had any bearing on it?

“There we are，”said Caleb, falling back a pace or two to form the better judgment of his work；“as near the real thing as sixpenn'orth of halfpence is to sixpence. What a pity that the whole front of the house opens at once！If there was only a staircase in it now, and regular doors to the rooms to go in at！But that's the worstof my calling, I'm always deluding myself, and swindling myself.”

“You are speaking quite softly. You are not tired, father?”

“Tired！”echoed Caleb with a great burst of animation.“What should tire me, Bertha?I was never tired. What does it mean?”

To give the greater force to his words, he checked himself in an involuntary imitation of two half-length stretching and yawning fgures on the mantel-shelf, who were represented as in one eternal state of weariness from the waist upwards；and hummed a fragment of a song. It was a Bacchanalian song, something about a Sparkling Bowl.He sang it with an assumption of a Devil-may-care voice, that made his face a thousand times more meagre and more thoughtful than ever.

“What！You're singing, are you?”said Tackleton, putting his head in at the door.“Go it！I can't sing.”

Nobody would have suspected him of it. He hadn't what is generally termed a singing face, by any means.

“I can't afford to sing，”said Tackleton.“I'm glad you can. I hope you can afford to work too.Hardly time for both, I should think?”

“If you could only see him, Bertha, how he's winking at me！”whispered Caleb.“Such a man to joke！You'd think, if you didn't know him, he was in earnest—wouldn't you now?”

The Blind Girl smiled and nodded.

“The bird that can sing and won't sing must be made to sing, they say，”grumbled Tackleton.“What about the owl that can't sing，&nbsp；and oughtn't to sing, and will sing；is there anything that he should be made to do?”

“The extent to which he's winking at this moment！”whispered Caleb to his daughter.“Oh, my gracious！”

“Always merry and light-hearted with us！”cried the smiling Bertha.

“Oh！you're there, are you?”answered Tackleton.“Poor Idiot！”

He really did believe she was an Idiot；and he founded the belief, I can't say whether consciously or not, upon her being fond of him.

“Well！and being there，—how are you?”said Tackleton in his grudging way.

“Oh！well；quite well！And as happy as even you can wish me to be. As happy as you would make the whole world, if you could！”

“Poor Idiot！”muttered Tackleton.“No gleam of reason. Not a gleam！”

The Blind Girl took his hand and kissed it；held it for a moment in her own two hands；and laid her cheek against it tenderly before releasing it. There was such unspeakable affection and such fervent gratitude in the act, that Tackleton himself was moved to say, in a milder growl than usual：

“What's the matter now?”

“I stood it close beside my pillow when I went to sleep last night, and remembered it in my dreams. And when the day broke, and the glorious red sun—the red sun, father?”

“Red in the mornings and the evenings, Bertha，”said poor Caleb, with a woeful glance at his employer.

“When it rose, and the bright light I almost fear to strike myself against in walking, came into the room, I turned the little tree towards it, and blessed Heaven for making things so precious, and blessed you for sending them to cheer me！”

“Bedlam broke loose！”said Tackleton under his breath.“We shall arrive at the strait-waistcoat and muffers soon. We're getting on！”

Caleb, with his hands hooked loosely in each other, stared vacantly before him while his daughter spoke, as if he really were uncertain（I believe he was）whether Tackleton had done anything to deserve her thanks or not. If he could have been a perfectly free agent at that moment, required, on pain of death, to kick the toy merchant, or fall at his feet, according to his merits, I believe it would have been an even chance which course he would have taken.Yet Caleb knew that with his own hands he had brought the little rose-tree home for her so carefully, and that with his own lips he had forged the innocent deception which should help to keep her from suspecting how much, how very much, he every day denied himself, that she might be happier.

“Bertha！”said Tackleton, assuming, for the nonce, a little cordiality.“Come here.”

“Oh, I can come straight to you！You needn't guide me！”she rejoined.

“Shall I tell you a secret, Bertha?”

“If you will！”she answered eagerly.

How bright the darkened face！How adorned with light the listening head！

“This is the day on which little what's-her-name, the spoilt child, Peerybingle's wife, pays her regular visit to you—makes her fantastic Picnic here, an't it?”said Tackleton with a strong expression of distaste for the whole concern.

“Yes，”replied Bertha.“This is the day.”

“I thought so，”said Tackleton.“I should like to join the party.”

“Do you hear that, father?”cried the Blind Girl in an ecstasy.

“Yes, yes, I hear it，”murmured Caleb with the fixed look of a sleep-walker；“but I don't believe it. It's one of my lies, I've no doubt.”

“You see I—I want to bring the Peerybingles a little more into company with May Fielding，”said Tackleton.“I'm going to be married to May.”

“Married！”cried the Blind Girl, starting from him.

“She's such a con-founded idiot，”muttered Tackleton，“that I was afraid she'd never comprehend me. Ah, Bertha！Married！Church, parson, clerk, beadle, glass coach, bells, breakfast, bridecake, favours, marrow-bones, cleavers, and all the rest of the tomfoolery.A wedding, you know；a wedding.Don't you know what a wedding is?”

“I know，”replied the Blind Girl in a gentle tone.“I understand！”“Do you?”muttered Tackleton.“It's more than I expected. Well！On that account I want to join the party, and to bring May and her mother.I'll send in a little something or other, before the afternoon.A cold leg of mutton, or some comfortable trife of that sort.You'll expect me?”

“Yes，”she answered.

She had drooped her head, and turned away；and so stood, with her hands crossed, musing.

“I don't think you will，”muttered Tackleton, looking at her；“for you seem to have forgotten all about it already. Caleb！”

“I may venture to say I'm here, I suppose，”thought Caleb.“Sir！”

“Take care she don't forget what I've been saying to her.”

“She never forgets，”returned Caleb.“It's one of the few things she an't clever in.”

“Every man thinks his own geese swans，”observed the toy merchant with a shrug.“Poor devil！”

Having delivered himself of which remark with infinite contempt, old Gruff and Tackleton withdrew.

Bertha remained where he had left her, lost in meditation. The gaiety had vanished from her downcast face, and it was very sad.Three or four times she shook her head, as if bewailing some remembrance or some loss；but her sorrowful reflections found no vent in words.

It was not until Caleb had been occupied some time in yoking a team of horses to a waggon by the summary process of nailing the&nbsp；harness to the vital parts of their bodies, that she drew near to his working-stool, and, sitting down beside him, said：

“Father, I am lonely in the dark. I want my eyes, my patient, willing eyes.”

“Here they are，”said Caleb.“Always ready. They are more yours than mine, Bertha, any hour in the four-and-twenty.What shall your eyes do for you, dear?”

“Look round the room, father.”

“All right，”said Caleb.“No sooner said than done, Bertha.”

“Tell me about it.”

“It's much the same as usual，”said Caleb.“Homely, but very snug. The gay colours on the walls；the bright fowers on the plates and dishes；the shining wood, where there are beams or panels；the general cheerfulness and neatness of the building，—make it very pretty.”

Cheerful and neat it was, wherever Bertha's hands could busy themselves. But nowhere else were cheerfulness and neatness possible in the old crazy shed which Caleb's fancy so transformed.

“You have your working dress on, and are not so gallant as when you wear the handsome coat?”said Bertha, touching him.

“Not quite so gallant，”answered Caleb.“Pretty brisk, though.”

“Father，”said the Blind Girl, drawing close to his side, and stealing one arm round his neck，“tell me something about May. She is very fair?”

“She is indeed，”said Caleb. And she was indeed.It was quite arare thing to Caleb not to have to draw on his invention.

“Her hair is dark，”said Bertha pensively，“darker than mine. Her voice is sweet and musical, I know.I have often loved to hear it.Her shape—”

“There's not a Doll's in all the room to equal it，”said Caleb.“And her eyes！—”

He stopped；for Bertha had drawn closer round his neck, and, from the arm that clung about him, came a warning pressure which he understood too well.

He coughed a moment, hammered for a moment, and then fell back upon the song about the sparkling bowl, his infallible resource in all such diffculties.

“Our friend, father, our benefactor. I am never tired, you know, of hearing about him.—Now, was I ever?”she said hastily.

“Of course not，”answered Caleb，“and with reason.”

“Ah！With how much reason！”cried the Blind Girl. With such fervency, that Caleb, though his motives were so pure, could not endure to meet her face；but dropped his eyes, as if she could have read in them his innocent deceit.

“Then tell me again about him, dear father，”said Bertha.“Many times again！His face is benevolent, kind, and tender. Honest and true, I am sure it is.The manly heart that tries to cloak all favours with a show of roughness and unwillingness, beats in its every look and glance.”

“And makes it noble，”added Caleb in his quiet desperation.

“And makes it noble，”cried the Blind Girl.“He is older than May, father.”

“Ye-es，”said Caleb reluctantly.“He's a little older than May. But that don't signify.”

“Oh, father, yes！To be his patient companion in infrmity and age；to be his gentle nurse in sickness, and his constant friend in suffering and sorrow；to know no weariness in working for his sake；to watch him, tend him, sit beside his bed and talk to him awake, and pray for him asleep；what privileges these would be！What opportunities for proving all her truth and her devotion to him！Would she do all this, dear father?”

“No doubt of it，”said Caleb.

“I love her, father；I can love her from my soul！”exclaimed the Blind Girl. And, saying so, she laid her poor blind face on Caleb's shoulder, and so wept and wept, that he was almost sorry to have brought that tearful happiness upon her.

In the meantime there had been a pretty sharp commotion at John Peerybingle's, for little Mrs. Peerybingle naturally couldn't think of going anywhere without the Baby；and to get the Baby under way took time.Not that there was much of the Baby, speaking of it as a thing of weight and measure, but there was a vast deal to do about and about it, and it all had to be done by easy stages.For instance, when the Baby was got, by hook and by crook, to a certain point of dressing, and you might have rationally supposed that anothertouch or two would fnish him off, and turn him out a tiptop Baby challenging the world, he was unexpectedly extinguished in a fannel cap, and hustled off to bed；where he simmered（so to speak）between two blankets for the best part of an hour.From this state of inaction he was then recalled, shining very much and roaring violently, to partake of—well?I would rather say, if you'll permit me to speak generally—of a slight repast.After which he went to sleep again.Mrs.Peerybingle took advantage of this interval, to make herself as smart in a small way as ever you saw anybody in all your life；and, during the same short truce, Miss Slowboy insinuated herself into a spencer of a fashion so surprising and ingenious, that it had no connection with herself, or anything else in the universe, but was a shrunken, dog's-eared, independent fact, pursuing its lonely course without the least regard to anybody.By this time, the Baby, being all alive again, was invested, by the united efforts of Mrs.Peerybingle and Miss Slowboy, with a cream-coloured mantle for its body, and a sort of nankeen raised pie for its head；and so, in course of time, they all three got down to the door, where the old horse had already taken more than the full value of his day's toll out of the Turnpike Trust, by tearing up the road with his impatient autographs；and whence Boxer might be dimly seen in the remote perspective, standing looking back, and tempting him to come on without orders.

As to a chair, or anything of that kind for helping Mrs. Peerybingle into the cart, you know very little of John, if you think that was necessary.Before you could have seen him lift her from the&nbsp；ground, there she was in her place, fresh and rosy, saying，“John！How can you?Think of Tilly！”

If I might be allowed to mention a young lady's legs on any terms, I would observe of Miss Slowboy's that there was a fatality about them which rendered them singularly liable to be grazed；and that she never effected the smallest ascent or descent without recording the circumstance upon them with a notch, as Robinson Crusoe marked the days upon his wooden calendar. But, as this might be considered ungenteel, I'll think of it.

“John！You've got the basket with the Veal and Ham Pie and things, and the bottles of Beer?”said Dot.“If you haven't, you must turn round again this very minute.”

“You're a nice little article，”returned the Carrier，“to be talking about turning round, after keeping me a full quarter of an hour behind my time.”

“I am sorry for it, John，”said Dot in a great bustle，“but I really could not think of going to Bertha's—I would not do it, John, on any account—without the Veal and Ham Pie and things, and the bottles of Beer. Way！”

This monosyllable was addressed to the horse, who didn't mind it at all.

“Oh, do way, John！”said Mrs. Peerybingle.“Please！”

“It'll be time enough to do that，”returned John，“when I begin to leave things behind me. The basket's safe enough.”

“What a hard-hearted monster you must be, John, not to havesaid so at once, and save me such a turn！I declare I wouldn't go to Bertha's without the Veal and Ham Pie and things, and the bottles of Beer, for any money. Regularly once a fortnight ever since we have been married, John, have we made our little Picnic there.If anything was to go wrong with it, I should almost think we were never to be lucky again.”

“It was a kind thought in the frst instance，”said the Carrier；“and I honour you for it, little woman.”

“My dear John！”replied Dot, turning very red.“Don't talk about honouring me. Good gracious！”

“By-the-bye—”observed the Carrier—“that old gentleman—”

Again so visibly and instantly embarrassed！

“He's an odd fsh，”said the Carrier, looking straight along the road before them.“I can't make him out. I don't believe there's any harm in him.”

“None at all. I'm—I'm sure there's none at all.”

“Yes，”said the Carrier, with his eyes attracted to her face by the great earnestness of her manner.“I am glad you feel so certain of it, because it's a confirmation to me. It's curious that he should have taken it into his head to ask leave to go on lodging with us；an't it?Things come about so strangely.”

“So very strangely，”she rejoined in a low voice, scarcely audible.

“However, he's a good-natured old gentleman，”said John，“and pays as a gentleman, and I think his word is to be relied upon, like&nbsp；a gentleman's. I had quite a long talk with him this morning：he can hear me better already, he says, as he gets more used to my voice.He told me a great deal about himself, and I told him a good deal about myself, and a rare lot of questions he asked me.I gave him information about my having two beats, you know, in my business；one day to the right from our house and back again；another day to the left from our house and back again（for he's a stranger, and don't know the names of places about here）；and he seemed quite pleased.‘Why, then I shall be returning home tonight your way，'he says，‘when I thought you’d be coming in an exactly opposite direction.That’s capital！I may trouble you for another lift, perhaps, but I’ll engage not to fall so sound asleep again.’He was sound asleep, sure-ly！—Dot！what are you thinking of?”

“Thinking of, John?I—I was listening to you.”

“Oh！That's all right！”said the honest Carrier.“I was afraid, from the look of your face, that I had gone rambling on so long as to set you thinking about something else. I was very near it, I'll be bound.”

Dot making no reply, they jogged on, for some little time, in silence. But, it was not easy to remain silent very long in John Peerybingle's cart, for everybody on the road had something to say.Though it might only be“How are you?”and, indeed, it was very often nothing else, still, to give that back again in the right spirit of cordiality, required, not merely a nod and a smile, but as wholesome an action of the lungs withal as a long-winded Parliamentary speech.Sometimes, passengers on foot, or horseback, plodded on a little way beside the cart, for the express purpose of having a chat；and then there was a great deal to be said on both sides.

Then, Boxer gave occasion to more good-natured recognitions of, and by, the Carrier, than half-a-dozen Christians could have done！Everybody knew him all along the road—especially the fowls and pigs, who, when they saw him approaching, with his body all on one side, and his ears pricked up inquisitively, and that knob of a tail making the most of itself in the air, immediately withdrew into remote back-settlements, without waiting for the honour of a nearer acquaintance. He had business elsewhere；going down all the turnings, looking into all the wells, bolting in and out of all the cottages, dashing into the midst of all the Dame Schools, futtering all the pigeons, magnifying the tails of all the cats, and trotting into the public-houses like a regular customer.Wherever he went, somebody or other might have been heard to cry，“Halloa！here's Boxer！”and out came that somebody forthwith, accompanied by at least two or three other somebodies, to give John Peerybingle and his pretty wife Good day.

The packages and parcels for the errand cart were numerous；and there were many stoppages to take them in and give them out, which were not by any means the worst parts of the journey. Some people were so full of expectation about their parcels, and other people were so full of wonder about their parcels, and other people were so full of inexhaustible directions about their parcels, and John&nbsp；had such a lively interest in all the parcels, that it was as good as a play.Likewise, there were articles to carry, which required to be considered and discussed, and in reference to the adjustment and disposition of which councils had to be holden by the Carrier and the senders：at which Boxer usually assisted, in short fts of the closest attention, and long fits of tearing round and round the assembled sages, and barking himself hoarse.Of all these little incidents, Dot was the amused and open-eyed spectatress from her chair in the cart；and as she sat there, looking on—a charming little portrait framed to admiration by the tilt—there was no lack of nudgings and glancings and whisperings and envyings among the younger men.And this delighted John the Carrier beyond measure；for he was proud to have his little wife admired, knowing that she didn't mind it—that, if anything, she rather liked it perhaps.

The trip was a little foggy, to be sure, in the January weather；and was raw and cold. But who cared for such trifles?Not Dot, decidedly.Not Tilly Slowboy, for she deemed sitting in a cart, on any terms, to be the highest point of human joys；the crowning circumstance of earthly hope.Not the Baby, I'll be sworn；for it's not in Baby nature to be warmer or more sound asleep, though its capacity is great in both respects, than that blessed young Peerybingle was, all the way.

You couldn't see very far in the fog, of course；but you could see a great deal！It's astonishing how much you may see in a thicker fog than that, if you will only take the trouble to look for it. Why, even to sit watching for the Fairyrings in the fields, and for the patches of hoar frost still lingering in the shade, near hedges and by trees, was a pleasant occupation, to make no mention of the unexpected shapes in which the trees themselves came starting out of the mist, and glided into it again.The hedges were tangled and bare, and waved a multitude of blighted garlands in the wind；but there was no discouragement in this.It was agreeable to contemplate；for it made the freside warmer in possession, and the summer greener in expectancy.The river looked chilly；but it was in motion, and moving at a good pace—which was a great point.The canal was rather slow and torpid；that must be admitted.Never mind.It would freeze the sooner when the frost set fairly in, and then there would be skating and sliding；and the heavy old barges, frozen up somewhere near a wharf, would smoke their rusty iron chimney-pipes all day, and have a lazy time of it.

In one place there was a great mound of weeds or stubble burning；and they watched the fre, so white in the daytime, faring through the fog, with only here and there a dash of red in it, until, in consequence, as she observed, of the smoke“getting up her nose，”Miss Slowboy choked—she could do anything of that sort, on the smallest provocation—and woke the Baby, who wouldn't go to sleep again. But Boxer, who was in advance some quarter of a mile or so, had already passed the outposts of the town, and gained the corner of the street where Caleb and his daughter lived；and, long before they had reached the door, he and the Blind Girl were on the pavement&nbsp；waiting to receive them.

Boxer, by the way, made certain delicate distinctions of his own, in his communication with Bertha, which persuade me fully that he knew her to be blind. He never sought to attract her attention by looking at her, as he often did with other people, but touched her invariably.What experience he could ever have had of blind people or blind dogs I don't know.He had never lived with a blind master；nor had Mr.Boxer the elder, nor Mrs.Boxer, nor any of his respectable family on either side, ever been visited with blindness, that I am aware of.He may have found it out for himself, perhaps, but he had got hold of it somehow；and therefore he had hold of Bertha too, by the skirt, and kept hold, until Mrs.Peerybingle and the Baby, and Miss Slowboy and the basket, were all got safely within doors.

May Fielding was already come；and so was her mother—a little querulous chip of an old lady with a peevish face, who, in right of having preserved a waist like a bedpost, was supposed to be a most transcendent fgure；and who, in consequence of having once been better off, or of labouring under an impression that she might have been, if something had happened which never did happen, and seemed to have never been particularly likely to come to pass—but it's all the same—was very genteel and patronising indeed. Gruff and Tackleton was also there, doing the agreeable, with the evident sensation of being as perfectly at home, and as unquestionably in his own element, as a fresh young salmon on the top of the GreatPyramid.

“May！My dear old friend！”cried Dot, running up to meet her.“What a happiness to see you！”

Her old friend was, to the full, as hearty and as glad as she；and it really was, if you'll believe me, quite a pleasant sight to see them embrace. Tackleton was a man of taste, beyond all question.May was very pretty.

You know sometimes, when you are used to a pretty face, how, when it comes into contact and comparison with another pretty face, it seems for the moment to be homely and faded, and hardly to deserve the high opinion you have had of it. Now, this was not at all the case, either with Dot or May；for May's face set off Dot's, and Dot's face set off May's, so naturally and agreeably, that, as John Peerybingle was very near saying when he came into the room, they ought to have been born sisters—which was the only improvement you could have suggested.

Tackleton had brought his leg of mutton, and, wonderful to relate, a tart besides—but we don't mind a little dissipation when our brides are in the case；we don't get married every day—and, in addition to these dainties, there were the Veal and Ham Pie, and“things，”as Mrs. Peerybingle called them；which were chiefy nuts and oranges, and cakes, and such small deer.When the repast was set forth on the board, flanked by Caleb's contribution, which was a great wooden bowl of smoking potatoes（he was prohibited, by solemn compact, from producing any other viands），Tackleton led&nbsp；his intended mother-in-law to the post of honour.For the better gracing of this place at the high festival, the majestic old soul had adorned herself with a cap, calculated to inspire the thoughtless with sentiments of awe.She also wore her gloves.But let us be genteel, or die！

Caleb sat next his daughter；Dot and her old schoolfellow were side by side；the good Carrier took care of the bottom of the table. Miss Slowboy was isolated, for the time being, from every article of furniture but the chair she sat on, that she might have nothing else to knock the Baby's head against.

As Tilly stared about her at the dolls and toys, they stared at her and at the company. The venerable old gentlemen at the street-doors（who were all in full action）showed especial interest in the party, pausing occasionally before leaping, as if they were listening to the conversation, and then plunging wildly over and over, a great many times, without halting for breath—as in a frantic state of delight with the whole proceedings.

Certainly, if these old gentlemen were inclined to have a fiendish joy in the contemplation of Tackleton's discomfiture, they had good reason to be satisfed. Tackleton couldn't get on at all；and the more cheerful his intended bride became in Dot's society, the less he liked it, though he had brought them together for that purpose.For he was a regular dog in the manger, was Tackleton；and, when they laughed and he couldn't, he took it into his head, immediately, that they must be laughing at him.

“Ah, May！”said Dot.“Dear, dear, what changes！To talk of those merry school days makes one young again.”

“Why, you an't particularly old at any time, are you?”said Tackleton.

“Look at my sober, plodding husband there，”returned Dot.“He adds twenty years to my age at least. Don't you, John?”

“Forty，”John replied.

“How many you'll add to Mary's, I am sure I don't know，”said Dot, laughing.“But she can't be much less than a hundred years of age on her next birthday.”

“Ha, ha！”laughed Tackleton. Hollow as a drum that laugh, though.And he looked as if he could have twisted Dot's neck comfortably.

“Dear, dear！”said Dot.“Only to remember how we used to talk, at school, about the husbands we would choose. I don't know how young, and how handsome, and how gay, and how lively mine was not to be！And as to May's！—Ah dear！I don't know whether to laugh or cry, when I think what silly girls we were.”

May seemed to know which to do；for the colour flashed into her face, and tears stood in her eyes.

“Even the very persons themselves—real live young men—we fxed on sometimes，”said Dot.“We little thought how things would come about. I never fixed on John, I'm sure；I never so much as thought of him.And, if I had told you you were ever to be married to Mr.Tackleton, why, you'd have slapped me.Wouldn't you, May?”

Though May didn't say yes, she certainly didn't say no, or express no, by any means.

Tackleton laughed—quite shouted, he laughed so loud. John Peerybingle laughed too, in his ordinary good-natured and contented manner；but his was a mere whisper of a laugh to Tackleton's.

“You couldn't help yourselves, for all that. You couldn't resist us, you see，”said Tackleton.“Here we are！Here we are！Where are your gay young bridegrooms now?”

“Some of them are dead，”said Dot；“and some of them forgotten. Some of them, if they could stand among us at this moment, would not believe we were the same creatures；would not believe that what they saw and heard was real, and we could forget them so.No！they would not believe one word of it！”

“Why, Dot！”exclaimed the Carrier.“Little woman！”

She had spoken with such earnestness and fire, that she stood in need of some recalling to herself, without doubt. Her husband's check was very gentle, for he merely interfered, as he supposed, to shield old Tackleton；but it proved effectual, for she stopped, and said no more.There was an uncommon agitation, even in her silence, which the wary Tackleton, who had brought his half-shut eye to bear upon her, noted closely, and remembered to some purpose too.

May uttered no word, good or bad, but sat quite still, with her eyes cast down, and made no sign of interest in what had passed. The good lady her mother now interposed, observing, in the frst instance, that girls were girls, and bygones bygones, and that, so long as youngpeople were young and thoughtless, they would probably conduct themselves like young and thoughtless persons：with two or three other positions of a no less sound and incontrovertible character.She then remarked, in a devout spirit, that she thanked Heaven she had always found in her daughter May a dutiful and obedient child：for which she took no credit to herself, though she had every reason to believe it was entirely owing to herself.With regard to Mr.Tackleton, she said, That he was in a moral point of view an undeniable individual, and That he was in an eligible point of view a son-in-law to be desired, no one in their senses could doubt.（She was very emphatic here.）With regard to the family into which he was so soon about, after some solicitation, to be admitted, she believed Mr.Tackleton knew that, although reduced in purse, it had some pretensions to gentility；and that if certain circumstances, not wholly unconnected, she would go so far as to say, with the Indigo Trade, but to which she would not more particularly refer, had happened differently, it might perhaps have been in possession of wealth.She then remarked that she would not allude to the past, and would not mention that her daughter had for some time rejected the suit of Mr.Tackleton；and that she would not say a great many other things which she did say at great length.Finally, she delivered it as the general result of her observation and experience, that those marriages in which there was least of what was romantically and sillily called love, were always the happiest；and that she anticipated the greatest possible amount of bliss—not rapturous bliss；but the solid, steady-going article—from the approaching nuptials.She concluded by informing the company that tomorrow was the day she had lived for expressly；and that, when it was over, she would desire nothing better than to be packed up and disposed of in any genteel place of burial.

As these remarks were quite unanswerable—which is the happy property of all remarks that are sufficiently wide of the purpose—they changed the current of the conversation, and diverted the general attention to the Veal and Ham Pie, the cold mutton, the potatoes, and the tart. In order that the bottled beer might not be slighted, John Peerybingle proposed Tomorrow：the Wedding-day；and called upon them to drink a bumper to it, before he proceeded on his journey.

For you ought to know that he only rested there, and gave the old horse a bait. He had to go some four or fve miles farther on；and, when he returned in the evening, he called for Dot, and took another rest on his way home.This was the order of the day on all the Picnic occasions, and had been ever since their institution.

There were two persons present, besides the bride and bridegroom elect, who did but indifferent honour to the toast. One of these was Dot, too flushed and discomposed to adapt herself to any small occurrence of the moment；the other, Bertha, who rose up hurriedly before the rest, and left the table.

“Good-bye！”said stout John Peerybingle, pulling on his dreadnought coat.“I shall be back at the old time. Good-bye all！”

“Good-bye, John，”returned Caleb.

He seemed to say it by rote, and to wave his hand in the sameunconscious manner；for he stood observing Bertha with an anxious wondering face, that never altered its expression.

“Good-bye, young shaver！”said the jolly Carrier, bending down to kiss the child；which Tilly Slowboy, now intent upon her knife and fork, had deposited asleep（and, strange to say, without damage）in a little cot of Bertha's furnishing；“good-bye！Time will come, I suppose, when you'll turn out into the cold, my little friend, and leave your old father to enjoy his pipe and his rheumatics in the chimney-corner；eh?Where's Dot?”

“I'm here, John！”she said, starting.

“Come, come！”returned the Carrier, clapping his sounding hands.“Where's the pipe?”

“I quite forgot the pipe, John.”

Forgot the pipe！Was such a wonder ever heard of?She！Forgot the pipe！

“I'll—I'll fll it directly. It's soon done.”

But it was not so soon done, either. It lay in the usual place—the Carrier's dreadnought pocket—with the little pouch, her own work, from which she was used to fill it；but her hand shook so, that she entangled it（and yet her hand was small enough to have come out easily, I am sure），and bungled terribly.The flling of the pipe and lighting it, those little offces in which I have commended her discretion, were vilely done from frst to last.During the whole process, Tackleton stood looking on maliciously with the half-closed eye；which, whenever it met hers—or caught it, for it can hardly&nbsp；be said to have ever met another eye：rather being a kind of trap to snatch it up—augmented her confusion in a most remarkable degree.

“Why, what a clumsy Dot you are this afternoon！”said John.“I could have done it better myself, I verily believe！”

With these good-natured words, he strode away, and presently was heard, in company with Boxer, and the old horse, and the cart, making lively music down the road. What time the dreamy Caleb still stood, watching his blind daughter, with the same expression on his face.

“Bertha！”said Caleb, softly.“What has happened?How changed you are, my darling, in a few hours—since this morning！You silent and dull all day！What is it?Tell me！”

“Oh, father, father！”cried the Blind Girl, bursting into tears.“Oh, my hard, hard fate！”

Caleb drew his hand across his eyes before he answered her.

“But think how cheerful and how happy you have been, Bertha！How good, and how much loved, by many people.”

“That strikes me to the heart, dear father！Always so mindful of me！Always so kind to me！”

Caleb was very much perplexed to understand her.

“To be—to be blind, Bertha, my poor dear，”he faltered，“is a great affiction；but—”

“I have never felt it！”cried the Blind Girl.“I have never felt it in its fulness. Never！I have sometimes wished that I could see you, or could see him—only once, dear father, only for one little minute—that I might know what it is I treasure up，”she laid her hands upon her breast，“and hold here！That I might be sure I have it right！And sometimes（but then I was a child）I have wept in my prayers at night, to think that, when your images ascended from my heart to Heaven, they might not be the true resemblance of yourselves.But I have never had these feelings long.They have passed away, and left me tranquil and contented.”

“And they will again，”said Caleb.

“But, father！Oh, my good gentle father, bear with me, if I am wicked！”said the Blind Girl.“This is not the sorrow that so weighs me down！”

Her father could not choose but let his moist eyes overfow；she was so earnest and pathetic. But he did not understand her yet.

“Bring her to me，”said Bertha.“I cannot hold it closed and shut within myself. Bring her to me, father！”

She knew he hesitated, and said，“May. Bring May！”

May heard the mention of her name, and, coming quietly towards her, touched her on the arm. The Blind Girl turned immediately, and held her by both hands.

“Look into my face, Dear heart, Sweet heart！”said Bertha.“Read it with your beautiful eyes, and tell me if the truth is written on it.”

“Dear Bertha, yes！”

The Blind Girl, still upturning the blank sightless face, down which the tears were coursing fast, addressed her in these words：

“There is not, in my soul, a wish or thought that is not for your&nbsp；good, bright May！There is not, in my soul, a grateful recollection stronger than the deep remembrance which is stored there of the many many times when, in the full pride of sight and beauty, you have had consideration for Blind Bertha, even when we two were children, or when Bertha was as much a child as ever blindness can be！Every blessing on your head！Light upon your happy course！Not the less, my dear May，”—and she drew towards her in a closer grasp，—“not the less, my bird, because, today, the knowledge that you are to be His wife has wrung my heart almost to breaking！Father, May, Mary！Oh, forgive me that it is so, for the sake of all he has done to relieve the weariness of my dark life：and for the sake of the belief you have in me, when I call Heaven to witness that I could not wish him married to a wife more worthy of his goodness！”

While speaking, she had released May Fielding's hands, and clasped her garments in an attitude of mingled supplication and love. Sinking lower and lower down, as she proceeded in her strange confession, she dropped at last at the feet of her friend, and hid her blind face in the folds of her dress.

“Great Power！”exclaimed her father, smitten at one blow with the truth，“have I deceived her from her cradle, but to break her heart at last?”

It was well for all of them that Dot, that beaming, useful, busy little Dot—for such she was, whatever faults she had, and however you may learn to hate her, in good time—it was well for all of them, I say, that she was there, or where this would have ended, it were hardto tell. But Dot, recovering her self-possession, interposed, before May could reply, or Caleb say another word.

“Come, come, dear Bertha！come away with me！Give her your arm, May！So. How composed she is, you see, already；and how good it is of her to mind us，”said the cheery little woman, kissing her upon the forehead.“Come away, dear Bertha！Come！and here's her good father will come with her, won't you, Caleb?To—be—sure！”

Well, well！she was a noble little Dot in such things, and it must have been an obdurate nature that could have withstood her influence. When she had got poor Caleb and his Bertha away, that they might comfort and console each other, as she knew they only could, she presently came bouncing back，—the saying is, as fresh as any daisy；I say fresher—to mount guard over that bridling little piece of consequence in the cap and gloves, and prevent the dear old creature from making discoveries.

“So bring me the precious Baby, Tilly，”said she, drawing a chair to the fre；“and while I have it in my lap, here's Mrs. Fielding, Tilly, will tell me all about the management of Babies, and put me right in twenty points where I'm as wrong as can be.Won't you, Mrs.Fielding?”

Not even the Welsh Giant, who, according to the popular expression, was so“slow”as to perform a fatal surgical operation upon himself, in emulation of a juggling trick achieved by his arch enemy at breakfast-time；not even he fell half so readily into the snare prepared for him as the old lady into this artful pitfall. The fact&nbsp；of Tackleton having walked out；and furthermore, of two or three people having been talking together at a distance, for two minutes, leaving her to her own resources；was quite enough to have put her on her dignity, and the bewailment of that mysterious convulsion in the Indigo Trade, for four-and-twenty hours.But this becoming deference to her experience, on the part of the young mother, was so irresistible, that after a short affectation of humility, she began to enlighten her with the best grace in the world；and, sitting bolt upright before the wicked Dot, she did, in half an hour, deliver more infallible domestic recipes and precepts than would（if acted on）have utterly destroyed and done up that Young Peerybingle, though he had been an Infant Samson.

To change the theme, Dot did a little needlework—she carried the contents of a whole workbox in her pocket；however she contrived it, I don't know—then did a little nursing；then a little more needlework；then had a little whispering chat with May, while the old lady dozed；and so in little bits of bustle, which was quite her manner always, found it a very short afternoon. Then, as it grew dark, and as it was a solemn part of this Institution of the Picnic that she should perform all Bertha's household tasks, she trimmed the fire, and swept the hearth, and set the tea-board out, and drew the curtain, and lighted a candle.Then she played an air or two on a rude kind of harp, which Caleb had contrived for Bertha, and played them very well；for Nature had made her delicate little ear as choice a one for music as it would have been for jewels, if she had had any to wear.By this time it was the established hour for having tea；and Tackleton came back again to share the meal, and spend the evening.

Caleb and Bertha had returned some time before, and Caleb had sat down to his afternoon's work. But he couldn't settle to it, poor fellow, being anxious and remorseful for his daughter.It was touching to see him sitting idle on his working stool, regarding her so wistfully, and always saying in his face，“Have I deceived her from her cradle, but to break her heart?”

When it was night, and tea was done, and Dot had nothing more to do in washing up the cups and saucers；in a word—for I must come to it, and there is no use in putting it off—when the time drew nigh for expecting the Carrier's return in every sound of distant wheels, her manner changed again, her colour came and went, and she was very restless. Not as good wives are when listening for their husbands.No, no, no.It was another sort of restlessness from that.

Wheels heard. A horse's feet.The barking of a dog.The gradual approach of all the sounds.The scratching paw of Boxer at the door！

“Whose step is that?”cried Bertha, starting up.

“Whose step?”returned the Carrier, standing in the portal, with his brown face ruddy as a winter berry from the keen night air.“Why, mine.”

“The other step，”said Bertha.“The man's tread behind you！”

“She is not to be deceived，”observed the Carrier, laughing.“Come along, sir. You'll be welcome, never fear！”

He spoke in a loud tone；and, as he spoke, the deaf old&nbsp；gentleman entered.

“He's not so much a stranger that you haven't seen him once, Caleb，”said the Carrier.“You'll give him house room till we go?”

“Oh, surely, John, and take it as an honour！”

“He's the best company on earth to talk secrets in，”said John.“I have reasonable good lungs, but he tries'em I can tell you. Sit down, sir.All friends here, and glad to see you！”

When he had imparted this assurance, in a voice that amply corroborated what he had said about his lungs, he added in his natural tone，“A chair in the chimney-corner, and leave to sit quite silent and look pleasantly about him, is all he cares for. He's easily pleased.”

Bertha had been listening intently. She called Caleb to her side, when he had set the chair, and asked him, in a low voice, to describe their visitor.When he had done so（truly now, with scrupulous fidelity），she moved, for the first time since he had come in, and sighed, and seemed to have no further interest concerning him.

The Carrier was in high spirits, good fellow that he was, and fonder of his little wife than ever.

“A clumsy Dot she was, this afternoon！”he said, encircling her with his rough arm, as she stood, removed from the rest；“and yet I like her somehow. See yonder, Dot！”

He pointed to the old man. She looked down.I think she trembled.

“He's—ha, ha, ha！—he's full of admiration for you！”said the Carrier.“Talked of nothing else the whole way here. Why, he's abrave old boy！I like him for it！”

“I wish he had a better subject, John，”she said with an uneasy glance about the room. At Tackleton especially.

“A better subject！”cried the jovial John.“There's no such thing. Come！off with the great-coat, off with the thick shawl, off with the heavy wrappers！and a cosy half-hour by the fre.My humble service, mistress.A game at cribbage, you and I?That's hearty.The cards and board, Dot.And a glass of beer here, if there's any left, small wife！”

His challenge was addressed to the old lady, who, accepting it with gracious readiness, they were soon engaged upon the game. At first, the Carrier looked about him sometimes with a smile, or now and then called Dot to peep over his shoulder at his hand, and advise him on some knotty point.But his adversary being a rigid disciplinarian, and subject to an occasional weakness in respect of pegging more than she was entitled to, required such vigilance on his part, as left him neither eyes nor ears to spare.Thus, his whole attention gradually became absorbed upon the cards；and he thought of nothing else, until a hand upon his shoulder restored him to a consciousness of Tackleton.

“I am sorry to disturb you—but a word directly.”

“I'm going to deal，”returned the Carrier.“It's a crisis.”

“It is，”said Tackleton.“Come here, man！”

There was that in his pale face which made the other rise immediately, and ask him, in a hurry, what the matter was.

“Hush！John Peerybingle，”said Tackleton，“I am sorry for this. I&nbsp；am indeed.I have been afraid of it.I have suspected it from the frst.”

“What is it?”asked the Carrier with a frightened aspect.

“Hush！I'll show you, if you'll come with me.”

The Carrier accompanied him without another word. They went across a yard, where the stars were shining, and by a little side-door, into Tackleton's own counting-house, where there was a glass window, commanding the ware-room, which was closed for the night.There was no light in the counting-house itself, but there were lamps in the long narrow ware-room；and consequently the window was bright.

“A moment！”said Tackleton.“Can you bear to look through that window, do you think?”

“Why not?”returned the Carrier.

“A moment more，”said Tackleton.“Don't commit any violence. It's of no use.It's dangerous too.You're a strong-made man；and you might do murder before you know it.”

The Carrier looked him in the face, and recoiled a step as if he had been struck. In one stride he was at the window, and he saw——

Oh, Shadow on the Hearth！Oh, truthful Cricket！Oh, perfdious wife！

He saw her with the old man—old no longer, but erect and gallant—bearing in his hand the false white hair that had won his way into their desolate and miserable home. He saw her listening to him, as he bent his head to whisper in her ear；and suffering him to clasp her round the waist, as they moved slowly down the dim woodengallery towards the door by which they had entered it.He saw them stop, and saw her turn—to have the face, the face he loved so, so presented to his view！—and saw her, with her own hands, adjust the lie upon his head, laughing, as she did it, at his unsuspicious nature！

He clenched his strong right hand at first, as if it would have beaten down a lion. But, opening it immediately again, he spread it out before the eyes of Tackleton（for he was tender of her even then），and so, as they passed out, fell down upon a desk, and was as weak as any infant.

He was wrapped up to the chin, and busy with his horse and parcels, when she came into the room, prepared for going home.

“Now, John dear！Good night, May！Good night, Bertha！”

Could she kiss them?Could she be blithe and cheerful in her parting?Could she venture to reveal her face to them without a blush?Yes. Tackleton observed her closely, and she did all this.

Tilly was hushing the baby, and she crossed and recrossed Tackleton a dozen times, repeating drowsily：

“Did the knowledge that it was to be its wives, then, wring its hearts almost to breaking；and did its fathers deceive it from its cradles but to break its hearts at last！”

“Now, Tilly, give me the Baby！Good night, Mr. Tackleton.Where's John, for goodness'sake?”

“He's going to walk beside the horse's head，”said Tackleton；who helped her to her seat.

“My dear John！Walk?Tonight?”

The muffled figure of her husband made a hasty sign in the affrmative；and, the false stranger and the little nurse being in their places, the old horse moved off. Boxer, the unconscious Boxer, running on before, running back, running round and round the cart, and barking as triumphantly and merrily as ever.

When Tackleton had gone off likewise, escorting May and her mother home, poor Caleb sat down by the fre beside his daughter；anxious and remorseful at the core；and still saying, in his wistful contemplation of her，“Have I deceived her from her cradle, but to break her heart at last?”

The toys that had been set in motion for the Baby had all stopped and run down long ago. In the faint light and silence, the imperturbably calm dolls, the agitated rocking-horses with distended eyes and nostrils, the old gentlemen at the street-doors, standing half doubled up upon their failing knees and ankles, the wry-faced nut-crackers, the very Beasts upon their way into the Ark, in twos, like a Boarding-School out walking, might have been imagined to be stricken motionless with fantastic wonder at Dot being false, or Tackleton beloved, under any combination of circumstances.





CHIRP THE THIRD


The Dutch clock in the corner struck Ten when the Carrier sat down by his freside. So troubled and grief-worn that he seemed to scare the Cuckoo, who, having cut his ten melodious announcements as short as possible, plunged back into the Moorish Palace again, and clapped his little door behind him, as if the unwonted spectacle were too much for his feelings.

If the little Hay-maker had been armed with the sharpest of scythes, and had cut at every stroke into the Carrier's heart, he never could have gashed and wounded it as Dot had done.

It was a heart so full of love for her；so bound up and held together by innumerable threads of winning remembrance, spun from the daily working of her many qualities of endearment；it was a heart in which she had enshrined herself so gently and so closely；a heart so single and so earnest in its Truth, so strong in right, so weak in wrong，—that it could cherish neither passion nor revenge at frst, and had only room to hold the broken image of its Idol.

But, slowly, slowly, as the Carrier sat brooding on his hearth, now cold and dark, other and fiercer thoughts began to rise within him, as an angry wind comes rising in the night. The Stranger was beneath his outraged roof.Three steps would take him to his chamber door.One blow would beat it in.“You might do murder before you know it，”Tackleton had said.How could it be murder, if he gave the villain time to grapple with him hand to hand?He was the younger man.

It was an ill-timed thought, bad for the dark mood of his mind. It was an angry thought, goading him to some avenging act, that should change the cheerful house into a haunted place which lonely travellers would dread to pass by night；and where the timid would see shadows struggling in the ruined windows when the moon was dim, and hear wild noises in the stormy weather.

He was the younger man！Yes, yes；some lover who had won the heart that he had never touched. Some lover of her early choice, of whom she had thought and dreamed, for whom she had pined and pined, when he had fancied her so happy by his side.Oh, agony to think of it！

She had been above-stairs with the Baby；getting it to bed. As he sat brooding on the hearth, she came close beside him, without his knowledge—in the turning of the rack of his great misery, he lost all other sounds—and put her little stool at his feet.He only knew it when he felt her hand upon his own, and saw her looking up into his face.

With wonder?No. It was his frst impression, and he was fain&nbsp；to look at her again, to set it right.No, not with wonder.With an eager and inquiring look；but not with wonder.At frst it was alarmed and serious；then, it changed into a strange, wild, dreadful smile of recognition of his thoughts；then, there was nothing but her clasped hands on her brow, and her bent head, and falling hair.

Though the power of Omnipotence had been his to wield at that moment, he had too much of its diviner property of Mercy in his breast, to have turned one feather's weight of it against her. But he could not bear to see her crouching down upon the little seat where he had often looked on her, with love and pride, so innocent and gay；and, when she rose and left him, sobbing as she went, he felt it a relief to have the vacant place beside him rather than her so long-cherished presence.This in itself was anguish keener than all, reminding him how desolate he was become, and how the great bond of his life was rent asunder.

The more he felt this, and the more he knew he could have better borne to see her lying prematurely dead before him with her little child upon her breast, the higher and the stronger rose his wrath against his enemy. He looked about him for a weapon.

There was a gun hanging on the wall. He took it down, and moved a pace or two towards the door of the perfdious Stranger's room.He knew the gun was loaded.Some shadowy idea that it was just to shoot this man like a wild beast seized him, and dilated in his mind until it grew into a monstrous demon in complete possession of him, casting out all milder thoughts, and setting up its undividedempire.

That phrase is wrong. Not casting out his milder thoughts, but artfully transforming them.Changing them into scourges to drive him on.Turning water into blood, love into hate, gentleness into blind ferocity.Her image, sorrowing, humbled, but still pleading to his tenderness and mercy with resistless power, never left his mind；but, staying there, it urged him to the door；raised the weapon to his shoulder；ftted and nerved his fngers to the trigger；and cried“Kill him！In his bed！”

He reversed the gun to beat the stock upon the door；he already held it lifted in the air；some indistinct design was in his thoughts of calling out to him to fy, for God's sake, by the window—

When suddenly, the struggling fire illuminated the whole chimney with a glow of light；and the Cricket on the Hearth began to Chirp！

No sound he could have heard, no human voice, not even hers, could so have moved and softened him. The artless words in which she had told him of her love for this same Cricket were once more freshly spoken；her trembling, earnest manner at the moment was again before him；her pleasant voice—oh, what a voice it was for making household music at the freside of an honest man！—thrilled through and through his better nature, and awoke it into life and action.

He recoiled from the door, like a man walking in his sleep, awakened from a frightful dream；and put the gun aside. Clasping&nbsp；his hands before his face, he then sat down again beside the fre, and found relief in tears.

The Cricket on the Hearth came out into the room, and stood in Fairy shape before him.

“‘I love it，'”said the Fairy Voice, repeating what he well remembered，“‘for the many times I have heard it, and the many thoughts its harmless music has given me.'”

“She said so！”cried the Carrier.“True！”

“‘This has been a happy home, John！and I love the Cricket for its sake！'”

“It has been, Heaven knows，”returned the Carrier.“She made it happy, always，—until now.”

“So gracefully sweet-tempered；so domestic, joyful, busy, and light-hearted！”said the Voice.

“Otherwise I never could have loved her as I did，”returned the Carrier.

The Voice, correcting him, said“do.”

The Carrier repeated“as I did.”But not firmly. His faltering tongue resisted his control, and would speak in its own way for itself and him.

The Figure, in an attitude of invocation, raised its hand and said：

“Upon your own hearth——”

“The hearth she has blighted，”interposed the Carrier.

“The hearth she has—how often！—blessed and brightened，”said the Cricket；“the hearth which, but for her, were only a fewstones and bricks and rusty bars, but which has been, through her, the Altar of your Home；on which you have nightly sacrifced some petty passion, selfshness, or care, and offered up the homage of a tranquil mind, a trusting nature, and an overfowing heart；so that the smoke from this poor chimney has gone upward with a better fragrance than the richest incense that is burnt before the richest shrines in all the gaudy temples of this world！—Upon your own hearth；in its quiet sanctuary；surrounded by its gentle infuences and associations；hear her！Hear me！Hear everything that speaks the language of your hearth and home！”

“And pleads for her?”inquired the Carrier.

“All things that speak the language of your hearth and home must plead for her！”returned the Cricket.“For they speak the truth.”

And while the Carrier, with his head upon his hands, continued to sit meditating in his chair, the Presence stood beside him, suggesting his refections by its power, and presenting them before him, as in a glass or picture. It was not a solitary Presence.From the hearth-stone, from the chimney, from the clock, the pipe, the kettle, and the cradle；from the floor, the walls, the ceiling, and the stairs；from the cart without, and the cupboard within, and the household implements；from everything and every place with which she had ever been familiar, and with which she had ever entwined one recollection of herself in her unhappy husband's mind，—Fairies came trooping forth.Not to stand beside him as the Cricket did, but to busy and bestir themselves.To do all honour to her image.To&nbsp；pull him by the skirts, and point to it when it appeared.To cluster round it, and embrace it, and strew fowers for it to tread on.To try to crown its fair head with their tiny hands.To show that they were fond of it, and loved it；and that there was not one ugly, wicked, or accusatory creature to claim knowledge of it—none but their playful and approving selves.

His thoughts were constant to her image. It was always there.

She sat plying her needle, before the fire, and singing to herself. Such a blithe, thriving, steady little Dot！The Fairy fgures turned upon him all at once, by one consent, with one prodigious concentrated stare, and seemed to say，“Is this the light wife you are mourning for?”

There were sounds of gaiety outside, musical instruments, and noisy tongues, and laughter. A crowd of young merry-makers came pouring in, among whom were May Fielding and a score of pretty girls.Dot was the fairest of them all；as young as any of them too.They came to summon her to join their party.It was a dance.If ever little foot were made for dancing, hers was, surely.But she laughed, and shook her head, and pointed to her cookery on the fre, and her table ready spread；with an exulting defance that rendered her more charming than she was before.And so she merrily dismissed them, nodding to her would-be partners, one by one, as they passed out, with a comical indifference, enough to make them go and drown themselves immediately if they were her admirers—and they must have been so, more or less；they couldn't help it.And yet indifferencewas not her character.Oh no！For presently there came a certain Carrier to the door；and, bless her, what a welcome she bestowed upon him！

Again the staring figures turned upon him all at once, and seemed to say，“Is this the wife who has forsaken you?”

A shadow fell upon the mirror or the picture：call it what you will. A great shadow of the Stranger, as he first stood underneath their roof；covering its surface, and blotting out all other objects.But, the nimble Fairies worked like bees to clear it off again.And Dot again was there.Still bright and beautiful.

Rocking her little Baby in its cradle, singing to it softly, and resting her head upon a shoulder which had its counterpart in the musing fgure by which the Fairy Cricket stood.

The night—I mean the real night：not going by Fairy clocks—was wearing now；and, in this stage of the Carrier's thoughts, the moon burst out, and shone brightly in the sky. Perhaps some calm and quiet light had risen also in his mind；and he could think more soberly of what had happened.

Although the shadow of the Stranger fell at intervals upon the glass—always distinct, and big, and thoroughly defined—it never fell so darkly as at frst. Whenever it appeared, the Fairies uttered a general cry of consternation, and plied their little arms and legs with inconceivable activity to rub it out.And whenever they got at Dot again, and showed her to him once more, bright and beautiful, they cheered in the most inspiring manner.

They never showed her otherwise than beautiful and bright, for they were Household Spirits to whom falsehood is an annihilation；and being so, what Dot was there for them, but the one active, beaming, pleasant little creature who had been the light and sun of the Carrier's Home?

The Fairies were prodigiously excited when they showed her, with the Baby, gossipping among a knot of sage old matrons, and affecting to be wondrous old and matronly herself, and leaning in a staid demure old way upon her husband's arm, attempting—she！such a bud of a little woman—to convey the idea of having abjured the vanities of the world in general, and of being the sort of person to whom it was no novelty at all to be a mother；yet, in the same breath, they showed her laughing at the Carrier for being awkward, and pulling up his shirt collar to make him smart, and mincing merrily about that very room to teach him how to dance！

They turned, and stared immensely at him when they showed her with the Blind Girl；for, though she carried cheerfulness and animation with her wheresoever she went, she bore those infuences into Caleb Plummer's home, heaped up and running over. The Blind Girl's love for her, and trust in her, and gratitude to her；her own good busy way of setting Bertha's thanks aside；her dexterous little arts for flling up each moment of the visit in doing something useful to the house, and really working hard while feigning to make holiday；her bountiful provision of those standing delicacies, the Veal and Ham Pie and the bottles of Beer；her radiant little face arrivingat the door, and taking leave；the wonderful expression in her whole self, from her neat foot to the crown of her head, of being a part of the establishment—a something necessary to it, which it couldn't be without，—all this the Fairies revelled in, and loved her for.And once again they looked upon him all at once, appealingly, and seemed to say, while some among them nestled in her dress and fondled her，“Is this the wife who has betrayed your confdence?”

More than once, or twice, or thrice, in the long thoughtful night, they showed her to him sitting on her favourite seat, with her bent head, her hands clasped on her brow, her falling hair. As he had seen her last.And when they found her thus, they neither turned nor looked upon him, but gathered close round her, and comforted and kissed her, and pressed on one another, to show sympathy and kindness to her, and forgot him altogether.

Thus the night passed. The moon went down；the stars grew pale；the cold day broke；the sun rose.The Carrier still sat, musing, in the chimney-corner.He had sat there, with his head upon his hands, all night.All night the faithful Cricket had been Chirp, Chirp, Chirping on the Hearth.All night he had listened to its voice.All night the Household Fairies had been busy with him.All night she had been amiable and blameless in the glass, except when that one shadow fell upon it.

He rose up when it was broad day, and washed and dressed himself. He couldn't go about his customary cheerful avocations—he wanted spirit for them—but it mattered the less that it was&nbsp；Tackleton's wedding-day, and he had arranged to make his rounds by proxy.He had thought to have gone merrily to church with Dot.But such plans were at an end.It was their own wedding-day too.Ah！how little he had looked for such a close to such a year！

The Carrier expected that Tackleton would pay him an early visit；and he was right. He had not walked to and fro before his own door many minutes, when he saw the toy merchant coming in his chaise along the road.As the chaise drew nearer, he perceived that Tackleton was dressed out sprucely for his marriage, and that he had decorated his horse's head with fowers and favours.

The horse looked much more like a bridegroom than Tackleton, whose half-closed eye was more disagreeably expressive than ever. But the Carrier took little heed of this.His thoughts had other occupation.

“John Peerybingle！”said Tackleton with an air of condolence.“My good fellow, how do you fnd yourself this morning?”

“I have had but a poor night, Master Tackleton，”returned the Carrier, shaking his head：“for I have been a good deal disturbed in my mind. But it's over now！Can you spare me half an hour or so, for some private talk?”

“I came on purpose，”returned Tackleton, alighting.“Never mind the horse. He'll stand quiet enough, with the reins over this post, if you'll give him a mouthful of hay.”

The Carrier having brought it from his stable and set it before him, they turned into the house.

“You are not married before noon，”he said，“I think?”

“No，”answered Tackleton.“Plenty of time. Plenty of time.”

When they entered the kitchen, Tilly Slowboy was rapping at the Stranger's door；which was only removed from it by a few steps. One of her very red eyes（for Tilly had been crying all night long, because her mistress cried）was at the keyhole；and she was knocking very loud, and seemed frightened.

“If you please I can't make nobody hear，”said Tilly, looking round.“I hope nobody an't gone and been and died if you please！”

This philanthropic wish Miss Slowboy emphasized with various new raps and kicks at the door, which led to no result whatever.

“Shall I go?”said Tackleton.“It's curious.”

The Carrier, who had turned his face from the door, signed him to go if he would.

So Tackleton went to Tilly Slowboy's relief；and he too kicked and knocked；and he too failed to get the least reply. But he thought of trying the handle of the door；and, as it opened easily, he peeped in, looked in, went in, and soon came running out again.

“John Peerybingle，”said Tackleton in his ear，“I hope there has been nothing—nothing rash in the night?”

The Carrier turned upon him quickly.

“Because he's gone！”said Tackleton；“and the window's open. I don't see any marks—to be sure, it's almost on a level with the garden：but I was afraid there might have been some—some scuffe.Eh?”

He nearly shut up the expressive eye altogether；he looked at him so hard. And he gave his eye, and his face, and his whole person, a sharp twist.As if he would have screwed the truth out of him.

“Make yourself easy，”said the Carrier.“He went into that room last night, without harm in word or deed from me, and no one has entered it since. He is away of his own free-will.I'd go out gladly at that door, and beg my bread from house to house, for life, if I could so change the past that he had never come.But he has come and gone.And I have done with him！”

“Oh！—Well, I think he has got off pretty easy，”said Tackleton, taking a chair.

The sneer was lost upon the Carrier, who sat down too, and shaded his face with his hand, for some little time, before proceeding.

“You showed me last night，”he said at length，“my wife—my wife that I love—secretly—”

“And tenderly，”insinuated Tackleton.

“—Conniving at that man's disguise, and giving him opportunities of meeting her alone. I think there's no sight I wouldn't have rather seen than that.I think there's no man in the world I wouldn't have rather had to show it me.”

“I confess to having had my suspicions always，”said Tackleton.“And that has made me objectionable here, I know.”

“But, as you did show it me，”pursued the Carrier, not minding him；“and as you saw her, my wife, my wife that I love—”his voice, and eye, and hand grew steadier and firmer as he repeated thesewords：evidently in pursuance of a steadfast purpose—“as you saw her at this disadvantage, it is right and just that you should also see with my eyes, and look into my breast, and know what my mind is upon the subject. For it's settled，”said the Carrier, regarding him attentively.“And nothing can shake it now.”

Tackleton muttered a few general words of assent about its being necessary to vindicate something or other；but he was overawed by the manner of his companion. Plain and unpolished as it was, it had a something dignifed and noble in it, which nothing but the soul of generous honour dwelling in the man could have imparted.

“I am a plain, rough man，”pursued the Carrier“with very little to recommend me. I am not a clever man, as you very well know.I am not a young man.I loved my little Dot, because I had seen her grow up, from a child, in her father's house；because I knew how precious she was；because she had been my life for years and years.There's many men I can't compare with, who never could have loved my little Dot like me, I think！”

He paused, and softly beat the ground a short time with his foot, before resuming：

“I often thought that though I wasn't good enough for her, I should make her a kind husband, and perhaps know her value better than another；and in this way I reconciled it to myself, and came to think it might be possible that we should be married. And, in the end, it came about, and we were married！”

“Hah！”said Tackleton with a signifcant shake of his head.

“I had studied myself；I had had experience of myself；I knew how much I loved her, and how happy I should be，”pursued the Carrier.“But I had not—I feel it now—suffciently considered her.”

“To be sure，”said Tackleton.“Giddiness, frivolity, fickleness, love of admiration！Not considered！All left out of sight！Hah！”

“You had best not interrupt me，”said the Carrier with some sternness，“till you understand me；and you're wide of doing so. If, yesterday, I'd have struck that man down at a blow, who dared to breathe a word against her, today I'd set my foot upon his face, if he was my brother！”

The toy merchant gazed at him in astonishment. He went on in a softer tone：

“Did I consider，”said the Carrier，“that I took her—at her age, and with her beauty—from her young companions, and the many scenes of which she was the ornament；in which she was the brightest little star that ever shone, to shut her up from day to day in my dull house, and keep my tedious company?Did I consider how little suited I was to her sprightly humour, and how wearisome a plodding man like me must be to one of her quick spirit?Did I consider that it was no merit in me, or claim in me, that I loved her, when everybody must who knew her?Never. I took advantage of her hopeful nature and her cheerful disposition；and I married her.I wish I never had！For her sake；not for mine！”

The toy merchant gazed at him without winking. Even the half-shut eye was open now.

“Heaven bless her！”said the Carrier，“for the cheerful constancy with which she has tried to keep the knowledge of this from me！And Heaven help me, that, in my slow mind, I have not found it out before！Poor child！Poor Dot！I not to fnd it out, who have seen her eyes fll with tears when such a marriage as our own was spoken of！I, who have seen the secret trembling on her lips a hundred times, and never suspected it, till last night！Poor girl！That I could ever hope she would be fond of me！That I could ever believe she was！”

“She made a show of it，”said Tackleton.“She made such a show of it, that, to tell you the truth, it was the origin of my misgivings.”

And here he asserted the superiority of May Fielding, who certainly made no sort of show of being fond of him.

“She has tried，”said the poor Carrier with greater emotion than he had exhibited yet；“I only now begin to know how hard she has tried, to be my dutiful and zealous wife. How good she has been；how much she has done；how brave and strong a heart she has；let the happiness I have known under this roof bear witness！It will be some help and comfort to me when I am here alone.”

“Here alone?”said Tackleton.“Oh！Then you do mean to take some notice of this?”

“I mean，”returned the Carrier，“to do her the greatest kindness, and make her the best reparation, in my power. I can release her from the daily pain of an unequal marriage, and the struggle to conceal it.She shall be as free as I can render her.”

“Make her reparation！”exclaimed Tackleton, twisting and turning his great ears with his hands.“There must be something wrong here. You didn't say that, of course.”

The Carrier set his grip upon the collar of the toy merchant, and shook him like a reed.

“Listen to me！”he said.“And take care that you hear me right. Listen to me.Do I speak plainly?”

“Very plainly indeed，”answered Tackleton.

“As if I meant it?”

“Very much as if you meant it.”

“I sat upon that hearth, last night, all night，”exclaimed the Carrier.“On the spot where she has often sat beside me, with her sweet face looking into mine. I called up her whole life day by day.I had her dear self, in its every passage, in review before me.And, upon my soul, she is innocent, if there is One to judge the innocent and guilty！”

Staunch Cricket on the Hearth！Loyal Household Fairies！

“Passion and distrust have left me！”said the Carrier；“and nothing but my grief remains. In an unhappy moment some old lover, better suited to her tastes and years than I, forsaken, perhaps, for me, against her will, returned.In an unhappy moment, taken by surprise, and wanting time to think of what she did, she made herself a party to his treachery by concealing it.Last night she saw him, in the interview we witnessed.It was wrong.But, otherwise than this, she is innocent, if there is truth on earth！”

“If that is your opinion—”Tackleton began.

“So, let her go！”pursued the Carrier.“Go, with my blessing for the many happy hours she has given me, and my forgiveness for any pang she has caused me. Let her go, and have the peace of mind I wish her！She'll never hate me.She'll learn to like me better when I'm not a drag upon her, and she wears the chain I have riveted more lightly.This is the day on which I took her, with so little thought for her enjoyment, from her home.Today she shall return to it, and I will trouble her no more.Her father and mother will be here today—we had made a little plan for keeping it together—and they shall take her home.I can trust her there, or anywhere.She leaves me without blame, and she will live so I am sure.If I should die—I may perhaps while she is still young；I have lost some courage in a few hours—she'll fnd that I remembered her, and loved her to the last！This is the end of what you showed me.Now, it's over！”

“Oh no, John, not over！Do not say it's over yet！Not quite yet. I have heard your noble words.I could not steal away, pretending to be ignorant of what has affected me with such deep gratitude.Do not say it's over till the clock has struck again！”

She had entered shortly after Tackleton, and had remained there. She never looked at Tackleton, but fxed her eyes upon her husband.But she kept away from him, setting as wide a space as possible between them；and, though she spoke with most impassioned earnestness, she went no nearer to him even then.How different in this from her old self！

“No hand can make the clock which will strike again for me the hours that are gone，”replied the Carrier with a faint smile.“But let it be so, if you will, my dear. It will strike soon.It's of little matter what we say.I'd try to please you in a harder case than that.”

“Well！”muttered Tackleton.“I must be off, for, when the clock strikes again, it'll be necessary for me to be upon my way to church. Good morning, John Peerybingle.I'm sorry to be deprived of the pleasure of your company.Sorry for the loss, and the occasion of it too！”

“I have spoken plainly?”said the Carrier, accompanying him to the door.

“Oh, quite！”

“And you'll remember what I have said?”

“Why, if you compel me to make the observation，”said Tackleton, previously taking the precaution of getting into his chaise，“I must say that it was so very unexpected, that I'm far from being likely to forget it.”

“The better for us both，”returned the Carrier.“Good-bye. I give you joy！”

“I wish I could give it to you，”said Tackleton.“As I can't, thankee. Between ourselves（as I told you before, eh?）I don't much think I shall have the less joy in my married life because May hasn't been too offcious about me, and too demonstrative.Good-bye！Take care of yourself.”

The Carrier stood looking after him until he was smaller in thedistance than his horse's fowers and favours near at hand；and then, with a deep sigh, went strolling like a restless, broken man, among some neighbouring elms；unwilling to return until the clock was on the eve of striking.

His little wife, being left alone, sobbed piteously；but often dried her eyes and checked herself, to say how good he was, how excellent he was！and once or twice she laughed；so heartily, triumphantly, and incoherently（still crying all the time），that Tilly was quite horrifed.

“Ow, if you please, don't！”said Tilly.“It's enough to dead and bury the Baby, so it is if you please.”

“Will you bring him sometimes to see his father, Tilly，”inquired her mistress, drying her eyes，—“when I can't live here, and have gone to my old home?”

“Ow, if you please, don't！”cried Tilly, throwing back her head, and bursting out into a howl—she looked at the moment uncommonly like Boxer.“Ow, if you please, don't！Ow, what has everybody gone and been and done with everybody, making everybody else so wretched?Ow-w-w-w！”

The soft-hearted Slowboy tailed off at this juncture into such a deplorable howl, the more tremendous from its long suppression, that she must infallibly have awakened the Baby, and frightened him into something serious（probably convulsions），if her eyes had not encountered Caleb Plummer leading in his daughter. This spectacle restoring her to a sense of the proprieties, she stood for some few moments silent, with her mouth wide open；and then, posting off to&nbsp；the bed on which the Baby lay asleep, danced in a weird, St.Vitus manner on the foor, and at the same time rummaged with her face and head among the bedclothes, apparently deriving much relief from those extraordinary operations.

“Mary！”said Bertha.“Not at the marriage！”

“I told her you would not be there, mum，”whispered Caleb.“I heard as much last night. But bless you，”said the little man, taking her tenderly by both hands，“I don't care for what they say.I don't believe them.There an't much of me, but that little should be torn to pieces sooner than I'd trust a word against you！”

He put his arms about her neck and hugged her, as a child might have hugged one of his own dolls.

“Bertha couldn't stay at home this morning，”said Caleb.“She was afraid, I know, to hear the bells ring, and couldn't trust herself to be so near them on their wedding-day. So we started in good time, and came here.I have been thinking of what I have done，”said Caleb after a moment's pause；“I have been blaming myself till I hardly knew what to do, or where to turn, for the distress of mind I have caused her；and I've come to the conclusion that I'd better, if you’ll stay with me, mum, the while, tell her the truth.You’ll stay with me the while?”he inquired, trembling from head to foot.“I don’t know what effect it may have upon her；I don’t know what she’ll think of me；I don’t know that she’ll ever care for her poor father afterwards.But it’s best for her that she should be undeceived, and I must bear the consequences as I deserve！”

“Mary，”said Bertha，“where is your hand?Ah！Here it is；here it is！”pressing it to her lips with a smile, and drawing it through her arm.“I heard them speaking softly among themselves last night of some blame against you. They were wrong.”

The Carrier's wife was silent. Caleb answered for her.

“They were wrong，”he said.

“I knew it！”cried Bertha, proudly.“I told them so. I scorned to hear a word！Blame her with justice！”she pressed the hand between her own, and the soft cheek against her face.“No, I am not so blind as that.”

Her father went on one side of her, while Dot remained upon the other, holding her hand.

“I know you all，”said Bertha，“better than you think. But none so well as her.Not even you, father.There is nothing half so real and so true about me as she is.If I could be restored to sight this instant, and not a word were spoken, I could choose her from a crowd！My sister！”

“Bertha, my dear！”said Caleb.“I have something on my mind I want to tell you while we three are alone. Hear me kindly！I have a confession to make to you, my darling！”

“A confession, father?”

“I have wandered from the truth, and lost myself, my child，”said Caleb with a pitiable expression in his bewildered face.“I have wandered from the truth, intending to be kind to you；and have been cruel.”

She turned her wonder-stricken face towards him, and repeated“Cruel！”

“He accuses himself too strongly, Bertha，”said Dot.“You'll say so presently. You'll be the frst to tell him so.”

“He cruel to me！”cried Bertha with a smile of incredulity.

“Not meaning it, my child，”said Caleb.“But I have been：though I never suspected it till yesterday. My dear blind daughter, hear me and forgive me.The world you live in, heart of mine, doesn't exist as I have represented it.The eyes you have trusted in have been false to you.”

She turned her wonder-stricken face towards him still；but drew back, and clung closer to her friend.

“Your road in life was rough, my poor one，”said Caleb，“and I meant to smooth it for you. I have altered objects, changed the characters of people, invented many things that never have been, to make you happier.I have had concealments from you, put deceptions on you, God forgive me！and surrounded you with fancies.”

“But living people are not fancies?”she said hurriedly, and turning very pale, and still retiring from him.“You can't change them.”

“I have done so, Bertha，”pleaded Caleb.“There is one person that you know, my dove—”

“Oh, father！why do you say, I know?”she answered in a term of keen reproach.“What and whom do I know?I who have no leader！I so miserably blind！”

In the anguish of her heart, she stretched out her hands, as if she were groping her way；then spread them, in a manner most forlorn and sad, upon her face.

“The marriage that takes place today，”said Caleb，“is with a stern, sordid, grinding man. A hard master to you and me, my dear, for many years.Ugly in his looks, and in his nature.Cold and callous always.Unlike what I have painted him to you in everything, my child.In everything.”

“Oh, why，”cried the Blind Girl, tortured, as it seemed, almost beyond endurance，“why did you ever do this?Why did you ever fll my heart so full, and then come in like Death, and tear away the objects of my love?O Heaven, how blind I am！How helpless and alone！”

Her afficted father hung his head, and offered no reply but in his penitence and sorrow.

She had been but a short time in this passion of regret when the Cricket on the Hearth, unheard by all but her, began to chirp. Not merrily, but in a low, faint, sorrowing way.It was so mournful, that her tears began to fow；and, when the Presence which had been beside the Carrier all night, appeared behind her, pointing to her father, they fell down like rain.

She heard the Cricket-voice more plainly soon, and was conscious, through her blindness, of the Presence hovering about her father.

“Mary，”said the Blind Girl，“tell me what my home is. What it&nbsp；truly is.”

“It is a poor place, Bertha；very poor and bare indeed. The house will scarcely keep out wind and rain another winter.It is as roughly shielded from the weather, Bertha，”Dot continued in a low, clear voice，“as your poor father in his sackcloth coat.”

The Blind Girl, greatly agitated, rose, and led the Carrier's little wife aside.

“Those presents that I took such care of；that came almost at my wish, and were so dearly welcome to me，”she said, trembling；“where did they come from?Did you send them?”

“No.”

“Who, then?”

Dot saw she knew already, and was silent. The Blind Girl spread her hands before her face again.But in quite another manner now.

“Dear Mary, a moment. One moment.More this way.Speak softly to me.You are true I know.You'd not deceive me now；would you?”

“No, Bertha, indeed！”

“No, I am sure you would not. You have too much pity for me.Mary, look across the room to where we were just now—to where my father is—my father, so compassionate and loving to me—and tell me what you see.”

“I see，”said Dot, who understood her well，“an old man sitting in a chair, and leaning sorrowfully on the back, with his face resting on his hand. As if his child should comfort him, Bertha.”

“Yes, yes. She will.Go on.”

“He is an old man, worn with care and work. He is a spare, dejected, thoughtful, grey-haired man.I see him now, despondent and bowed down, and striving against nothing.But, Bertha, I have seen him many times before, and striving hard in many ways, for one great sacred object.And I honour his grey head, and bless him！”

The Blind Girl broke away from her；and, throwing herself upon her knees before him, took the grey head to her breast.

“It is my sight restored. It is my sight！”she cried.“I have been blind, and now my eyes are open.I never knew him！To think I might have died, and never truly seen the father who has been so loving to me！”

There were no words for Caleb's emotion.

“There is not a gallant fgure on this earth，”exclaimed the Blind Girl, holding him in her embrace，“that I would love so dearly, and would cherish so devotedly, as this！The greyer, and more worn, the dearer, father！Never let them say I am blind again. There's not a furrow in his face, there's not a hair upon his head, that shall be forgotten in my prayers and thanks to Heaven！”

Caleb managed to articulate，“My Bertha！”

“And in my blindness I believed him，”said the girl, caressing him with tears of exquisite affection，“to be so different. And having him beside me day by day, so mindful of me always, never dreamed of this！”

“The fresh smart father in the blue coat, Bertha，”said poor&nbsp；Caleb.“He's gone！”

“Nothing is gone，”she answered.“Dearest father, no！Everything is here—in you. The father that I loved so well；the father that I never loved enough, and never knew；the benefactor whom I frst began to reverence and love, because he had such sympathy for me，—all are here in you.Nothing is dead to me.The soul of all that was most dear to me is here—here, with the worn face, and the grey head.And I am NOT blind, father, any longer！”

Dot's whole attention had been concentrated, during this discourse, upon the father and daughter；but looking, now, towards the little Hay-maker in the Moorish meadow, she saw that the clock was within a few minutes of striking, and fell, immediately, into a nervous and excited state.

“Father！”said Bertha, hesitating.“Mary！”

“Yes, my dear，”returned Caleb.“Here she is.”

“There is no change in her. You never told me anything of her that was not true?”

“I should have done it, my dear, I'm afraid，”returned Caleb，“if I could have made her better than she was. But I must have changed her for the worse, if I had changed her at all.Nothing could improve her, Bertha.”

Confident as the Blind Girl had been when she asked the question, her delight and pride in the reply, and her renewed embrace of Dot, were charming to behold.

“More changes than you think for may happen, though, mydear，”said Dot.“Changes for the better, I mean；changes for great joy to some of us. You mustn't let them startle you too much, if any such should ever happen, and affect you.Are those wheels upon the road?You've a quick ear, Bertha.Are they wheels?”

“Yes. Coming very fast.”

“I—I—I know you have a quick ear，”said Dot, placing her hand upon her heart, and evidently talking on as fast as she could, to hide its palpitating state，“because I have noticed it often, and because you were so quick to fnd out that strange step last night. Though why you should have said, as I very well recollect you did say, Bertha，‘Whose step is that?'and why you should have taken any greater observation of it than of any other step, I don't know.Though, as I said just now, there are great changes in the world：great changes：and we can't do better than prepare ourselves to be surprised at hardly anything.”

Caleb wondered what this meant；perceiving that she spoke to him, no less than to his daughter. He saw her, with astonishment, so futtered and distressed that she could scarcely breathe；and holding to a chair, to save herself from falling.

“They are wheels indeed！”she panted.“Coming nearer！Nearer！Very close！And now you hear them stopping at the garden-gate！And now you hear a step outside the door—the same step, Bertha, is it not?—and now—！”

She uttered a wild cry of uncontrollable delight；and running up to Caleb, put her hands upon his eyes, as a young man rushed into the room, and, finging away his hat into the air, came sweeping&nbsp；down upon them.

“Is it over?”cried Dot.

“Yes！”

“Happily over?”

“Yes！”

“Do you recollect the voice, dear Caleb?Did you ever hear the like of it before?”cried Dot.

“If my boy in the Golden South Americas was alive—！”said Caleb, trembling.

“He is alive！”shrieked Dot, removing her hands from his eyes, and clapping them in ecstasy.“Look at him！See where he stands before you, healthy and strong！Your own dear son. Your own dear living, loving brother, Bertha！”

All honour to the little creature for her transports！All honour to her tears and laughter, when the three were locked in one another's arms！All honour to the heartiness with which she met the sunburnt sailor-fellow, with his dark streaming hair, half-way, and never turned her rosy little mouth aside, but suffered him to kiss it freely, and to press her to his bounding heart！

And honour to the Cuckoo too—why not?—for bursting out of the trap-door in the Moorish Palace like a housebreaker, and hiccoughing twelve times on the assembled company, as if he had got drunk for joy！

The Carrier, entering, started back. And well he might, to fnd himself in such good company.

“Look, John！”said Caleb, exultingly，“look here！My own boy from the Golden South Americas！My own son！Him that you ftted out, and sent away yourself！Him that you were always such a friend to！”

The Carrier advanced to seize him by the hand；but, recoiling, as some feature in his face awakened a remembrance of the Deaf Man in the Cart, said：

“Edward！Was it you?”

“Now tell him all！”cried Dot.“Tell him all, Edward；and don't spare me, for nothing shall make me spare myself in his eyes, ever again.”

“I was the man，”said Edward.

“And could you steal, disguised, into the house of your old friend?”rejoined the Carrier.“There was a frank boy once—how many years is it, Caleb, since we heard that he was dead, and had it proved, we thought?—who never would have done that.”

“There was a generous friend of mine once；more a father to me than a friend，”said Edward；“who never would have judged me, or any other man, unheard. You were he.So I am certain you will hear me now.”

The Carrier, with a troubled glance at Dot, who still kept far away from him, replied，“Well！that's but fair. I will.”

“You must know that when I left here a boy，”said Edward，“I was in love, and my love was returned. She was a very young girl, who perhaps（you may tell me）didn't know her own mind.But I&nbsp；knew mine, and I had a passion for her.”

“You had！”exclaimed the Carrier.“You！”

“Indeed I had，”returned the other.“And she returned it. I have ever since believed she did, and now I am sure she did.”

“Heaven help me！”said the Carrier.“This is worse than all.”

“Constant to her，”said Edward，“and returning, full of hope, after many hardships and perils, to redeem my part of our old contract, I heard, twenty miles away, that she was false to me；that she had forgotten me；and had bestowed herself upon another and a richer man. I had no mind to reproach her；but I wished to see her, and to prove beyond dispute that this was true.I hoped she might have been forced into it against her own desire and recollection.It would be small comfort, but it would be some, I thought, and on I came.That I might have the truth, the real truth, observing freely for myself, and judging for myself, without obstruction on the one hand, or presenting my own influence（if I had any）before her, on the other, I dressed myself unlike myself—you know how；and waited on the road—you know where.You had no suspicion of me；neither had—had she，”pointing to Dot，“until I whispered in her ear at that freside, and she so nearly betrayed me.”

“But when she knew that Edward was alive, and had come back，”sobbed Dot, now speaking for herself, as she had burned to do, all through this narrative；“and when she knew his purpose, she advised him by all means to keep his secret close；for his old friend John Peerybingle was much too open in his nature, and tooclumsy in all artifice—being a clumsy man in general，”said Dot, half laughing and half crying—“to keep it for him. And when she—that's me, John，”sobbed the little woman—“told him all, and how his sweetheart had believed him to be dead；and how she had at last been over-persuaded by her mother into a marriage which the silly, dear old thing called advantageous；and when she—that's me again, John—told him they were not yet married（though close upon it），and that it would be nothing but a sacrifce if it went on, for there was no love on her side；and when he went nearly mad with joy to hear it，—then she—that's me again—said she would go between them, as she had often done before in old times, John, and would sound his sweetheart, and be sure that what she—me again, John—said and thought was right.And it WAS right, John！And they were brought together, John！And they were married, John, an hour ago！And here's the Bride！And Gruff and Tackleton may die a bachelor！And I'm a happy little woman, May, God bless you！”

She was an irresistible little woman, if that be anything to the purpose；and never so completely irresistible as in her present transports. There never were congratulations so endearing and delicious as those she lavished on herself and on the Bride.

Amid the tumult of emotions in his breast, the honest Carrier had stood confounded. Flying, now, towards her, Dot stretched out her hand to stop him, and retreated as before.

“No, John, no！Hear all！Don't love me any more, John, till you've heard every word I have to say. It was wrong to have a secret&nbsp；from you, John.I'm very sorry.I didn't think it any harm, till I came and sat down by you on the little stool last night.But when I knew, by what was written in your face, that you had seen me walking in the gallery with Edward, and when I knew what you thought, I felt how giddy and how wrong it was.But oh, dear John, how could you, could you think so?”

Little woman, how she sobbed again！John Peerybingle would have caught her in his arms. But no；she wouldn't let him.

“Don't love me yet, please, John！Not for a long time yet！When I was sad about this intended marriage, dear, it was because I remembered May and Edward such young lovers；and knew that her heart was far away from Tackleton. You believe that, now, don't you, John?”

John was going to make another rush at this appeal；but she stopped him again.

“No；keep there, please, John！When I laugh at you, as I sometimes do, John, and call you clumsy and a dear old goose, and names of that sort, it's because I love you, John, so well, and take such pleasure in your ways, and wouldn't see you altered in the least respect to have you made a king tomorrow.”

“Hooroar！”said Caleb with unusual vigour.“My opinion！”

“And when I speak of people being middle-aged and steady, John, and pretend that we are a humdrum couple, going on in a jog-trot sort of way, it's only because I'm such a silly little thing, John, that I like, sometimes, to act as a kind of Play with Baby, and all that：and make believe.”

She saw that he was coming；and stopped him again. But she was very nearly too late.

“No, don't love me for another minute or two, if you please, John！What I want most to tell you, I have kept to the last. My dear, good, generous John, when we were talking the other night about the Cricket, I had it on my lips to say, that at frst I did not love you quite so dearly as I do now；when I frst came home here, I was half afraid that I mightn't learn to love you every bit as well as I hoped and prayed I might—being so very young, John！But, dear John, every day and hour I loved you more and more.And if I could have loved you better than I do, the noble words I heard you say this morning would have made me.But I can't.All the affection that I had（it was a great deal, John）I gave you, as you well deserve, long, long ago, and I have no more left to give.Now, my dear husband, take me to your heart again！That's my home, John；and never, never think of sending me to any other！”

You never will derive so much delight from seeing a glorious little woman in the arms of a third party as you would have felt if you had seen Dot run into the Carrier's embrace. It was the most complete, unmitigated, soul-fraught little piece of earnestness that ever you beheld in all your days.

You may be sure the Carrier was in a state of perfect rapture；and you may be sure Dot was likewise；and you may be sure they all were, inclusive of Miss Slowboy, who wept copiously for joy, and，&nbsp；wishing to include her young charge in the general interchange of congratulations, handed round the Baby to everybody in succession, as if it were something to drink.

But, now, the sound of wheels was heard again outside the door；and somebody exclaimed that Gruff and Tackleton was coming back. Speedily that worthy gentleman appeared, looking warm and fustered.

“Why, what the Devil's this, John Peerybingle?”said Tackleton.“There's some mistake. I appointed Mrs.Tackleton to meet me at the church, and I'll swear I passed her on the road, on her way here.Oh！here she is！I beg your pardon, sir；I haven't the pleasure of knowing you；but, if you can do me the favour to spare this young lady, she has rather a particular engagement this morning.”

“But I can't spare her，”returned Edward.“I couldn't think of it.”

“What do you mean, you vagabond?”said Tackleton.

“I mean that, as I can make allowance for your being vexed，”returned the other with a smile，“I am as deaf to harsh discourse this morning as I was to all discourse last night.”

The look that Tackleton bestowed upon him, and the start he gave！

“I am sorry, sir，”said Edward, holding out May's left hand, and especially the third finger，“that the young lady can't accompany you to church；but, as she has been there once this morning, perhaps you'll excuse her.”

Tackleton looked hard at the third fnger, and took a little piece of silver paper, apparently containing a ring, from his waistcoat pocket.

“Miss Slowboy，”said Tackleton，“will you have the kindness to throw that in the fre?Thankee.”

“It was a previous engagement, quite an old engagement, that prevented my wife from keeping her appointment with you, I assure you，”said Edward.

“Mr. Tackleton will do me the justice to acknowledge that I revealed it to him faithfully；and that I told him, many times, I never could forget it，”said May, blushing.

“Oh, certainly！”said Tackleton.“Oh, to be sure！Oh, it's all right, it's quite correct！Mrs. Edward Plummer, I infer?”

“That's the name，”returned the bridegroom.

“Ah！I shouldn't have known you, sir，”said Tackleton, scrutinising his face narrowly, and making a low bow.“I give you joy, sir！”

“Thankee.”

“Mrs. Peerybingle，”said Tackleton, turning suddenly to where she stood with her husband；“I'm sorry.You haven't done me a very great kindness, but, upon my life, I am sorry.You are better than I thought you.John Peerybingle, I am sorry.You understand me；that's enough.It's quite correct, ladies and gentlemen all, and perfectly satisfactory.Good morning！”

With these words he carried it off, and carried himself off too：merely stopping at the door to take the fowers and favours from his horse's head, and to kick that animal once in the ribs, as a means of informing him that there was a screw loose in his arrangements.

Of course, it became a serious duty now to make such a day of it as should mark these events for a high Feast and Festival in the Peerybingle Calendar for evermore. Accordingly, Dot went to work to produce such an entertainment as should refect undying honour on the house and on every one concerned；and, in a very short space of time, she was up to her dimpled elbows in flour, and whitening the Carrier's coat, every time he came near her, by stopping him to give him a kiss.That good fellow washed the greens, and peeled the turnips, and broke the plates, and upset iron pots full of cold water on the fire, and made himself useful in all sorts of ways：while a couple of professional assistants, hastily called in from somewhere in the neighbourhood, as on a point of life or death, ran against each other in all the doorways and round all the corners, and everybody tumbled over Tilly Slowboy and the Baby, everywhere.Tilly never came out in such force before.Her ubiquity was the theme of general admiration.She was a stumbling-block in the passage at five-and-twenty minutes past two；a man-trap in the kitchen at half-past two precisely；and a pitfall in the garret at five-and-twenty minutes to three.The Baby's head was, as it were, a test and touchstone for every description of matter, animal, vegetable, and mineral.Nothing was in use that day that didn't come, at some time or other, into close acquaintance with it.

Then there was a great Expedition set on foot to go and find out Mrs. Fielding；and to be dismally penitent to that excellent gentlewoman；and to bring her back, by force, if needful, to be happy and forgiving.And when the Expedition first discovered her, she would listen to no terms at all, but said, an unspeakable number of times, that ever she should have lived to see the day！and couldn't be got to say anything else, except“Now carry me to the grave：”which seemed absurd, on account of her not being dead, or anything at all like it.After a time she lapsed into a state of dreadful calmness, and observed that, when that unfortunate train of circumstances had occurred in the Indigo Trade, she had foreseen that she would be exposed, during her whole life, to every species of insult and contumely；and that she was glad to fnd it was the case；and begged they wouldn't trouble themselves about her，—for what was she?—oh dear！a nobody！—but would forget that such a being lived, and would take their course in life without her.From this bitterly sarcastic mood she passed into an angry one, in which she gave vent to the remarkable expression that the worm would turn if trodden on；and, after that, she yielded to a soft regret, and said, if they had only given her their confdence, what might she not have had it in her power to suggest！Taking advantage of this crisis in her feelings, the Expedition embraced her；and she very soon had her gloves on, and was on her way to John Peerybingle's in a state of unimpeachable gentility；with a paper parcel at her side containing a cap of state, almost as tall, and quite as stiff, as a mitre.

Then, there were Dot's father and mother to come in another little chaise；and they were behind their time；and fears were entertained；and there was much looking out for them down the road；and Mrs. Fielding always would look in the wrong and morally impossible direction；and, being apprised thereof, hoped she might take the liberty of looking where she pleased.At last they came；a chubby little couple, jogging along in a snug and comfortable little way that quite belonged to the Dot family；and Dot and her mother, side by side, were wonderful to see.They were so like each other.

Then Dot's mother had to renew her acquaintance with May's mother；and May's mother always stood on her gentility；and Dot's mother never stood on anything but her active little feet. And old Dot—so to call Dot's father, I forgot it wasn’t his right name, but never mind—took liberties, and shook hands at first sight, and seemed to think a cap but so much starch and muslin, and didn’t defer himself at all to the Indigo Trade, but said there was no help for it now；and, in Mrs.Fielding’s summing up, was a good-natured kind of man—but coarse, my dear.

I wouldn't have missed Dot, doing the honours in her wedding-gown, my benison on her bright face！for any money. No！nor the good Carrier, so jovial and so ruddy, at the bottom of the table.Nor the brown, fresh sailor-fellow, and his handsome wife.Nor any one among them.To have missed the dinner would have been to miss as jolly and as stout a meal as man need eat；and to have missed the overfowing cups in which they drank The Wedding Day would havebeen the greatest miss of all.

After dinner Caleb sang the song about the Sparkling Bowl. As I'm a living man, hoping to keep so for a year or two, he sang it through.

And, by-the-bye, a most unlooked-for incident occurred, just as he fnished the last verse.

There was a tap at the door；and a man came staggering in, without saying with your leave, or by your leave, with something heavy on his head. Setting this down in the middle of the table, symmetrically in the centre of the nuts and apples, he said：

“Mr. Tackleton's compliments, and, as he hasn't got no use for the cake himself, p'raps you'll eat it.”

And, with those words, he walked off.

There was some surprise among the company, as you may imagine. Mrs.Fielding, being a lady of infinite discernment, suggested that the cake was poisoned, and related a narrative of a cake which, within her knowledge, had turned a seminary for young ladies blue.But she was overruled by acclamation；and the cake was cut by May with much ceremony and rejoicing.

I don't think any one had tasted it, when there came another tap at the door, and the same man appeared again, having under his arm a vast brown-paper parcel.

“Mr. Tackleton's compliments, and he's sent a few toys for the Babby.They ain't ugly.”

After the delivery of which expressions, he retired again.

The whole party would have experienced great difficulty in finding words for their astonishment, even if they had had ample time to seek them. But they had none at all；for the messenger had scarcely shut the door behind him, when there came another tap, and Tackleton himself walked in.

“Mrs. Peerybingle！”said the toy merchant, hat in hand，“I'm sorry.I'm more sorry than I was this morning.I have had time to think of it.John Peerybingle！I am sour by disposition；but I can't help being sweetened, more or less, by coming face to face with such a man as you.Caleb！This unconscious little nurse gave me a broken hint last night, of which I have found the thread.I blush to think how easily I might have bound you and your daughter to me, and what a miserable idiot I was when I took her for one！Friends, one and all, my house is very lonely tonight.I have not so much as a Cricket on my Hearth.I have scared them all away.Be gracious to me：let me join this happy party！”

He was at home in fve minutes. You never saw such a fellow.What had he been doing with himself all his life, never to have known before his great capacity of being jovial?Or what had the Fairies been doing with him, to have effected such a change?

“John！you won't send me home this evening, will you?”whispered Dot.

He had been very near it, though.

There wanted but one living creature to make the party complete；and, in the twinkling of an eye, there he was, very thirstywith hard running, and engaged in hopeless endeavours to squeeze his head into a narrow pitcher. He had gone with the cart to its journey's end, very much disgusted with the absence of his master, and stupendously rebellious to the Deputy.After lingering about the stable for some little time, vainly attempting to incite the old horse to the mutinous act of returning on his own account, he had walked into the taproom, and laid himself down before the fire.But, suddenly yielding to the conviction that the Deputy was a humbug, and must be abandoned, he had got up again, turned tail, and come home.

There was a dance in the evening. With which general mention of that recreation, I should have left it alone, if I had not some reason to suppose that it was quite an original dance, and one of a most uncommon fgure.It was formed in an odd way；in this way.

Edward, that sailor-fellow—a good free dashing sort of fellow he was—had been telling them various marvels concerning parrots, and mines, and Mexicans, and gold dust, when all at once he took it in his head to jump up from his seat and propose a dance；for Bertha's harp was there, and she such a hand upon it as you seldom hear. Dot（sly little piece of affectation when she chose）said her dancing days were over；I think because the Carrier was smoking his pipe, and she liked sitting by him best.Mrs.Fielding had no choice, of course, but to say her dancing days were over, after that；and everybody said the same, except May；May was ready.

So, May and Edward get up, amid great applause, to dance alone；and Bertha plays her liveliest tune.

Well！if you'll believe me, they had not been dancing five minutes, when suddenly the Carrier fings his pipe away, takes Dot round the waist, dashes out into the room, and starts off with her, toe and heel, quite wonderfully. Tackleton no sooner sees this than he skims across to Mrs.Fielding, takes her round the waist, and follows suit.Old Dot no sooner sees this than up he is, all alive, whisks off Mrs.Dot into the middle of the dance, and is foremost there.Caleb no sooner sees this than he clutches Tilly Slowboy by both hands, and goes off at score；Miss Slowboy, firm in the belief that diving hotly in among the other couples, and effecting any number of concussions with them, is your only principle of footing it.

Hark！how the Cricket joins the music with its Chirp, Chirp, Chirp；and how the kettle hums！

But what is this?Even as I listen to them blithely, and turn towards Dot, for one last glimpse of a little fgure very pleasant to me, she and the rest have vanished into air, and I am left alone. A Cricket sings upon the Hearth；a broken child's toy lies upon the ground：and nothing else remains.
