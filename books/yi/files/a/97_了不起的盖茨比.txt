译者序


F.S.菲茨杰拉德（1896—1940）是美国20世纪最重要的小说家之一，在美国文坛占据着重要的位置。他是“迷惘的一代”的代表作家，是“爵士时代”的桂冠诗人。其代表作品有《人间天堂》、《美丽的不幸者》、《夜色温柔》、《了不起的盖茨比》，短篇小说集有《爵士时代的故事》、《所有悲伤的年轻人的故事》等等，其中《了不起的盖茨比》被认为是菲茨杰拉德最优秀的作品。

菲茨杰拉德于1896年9月24日出生在明尼苏达州圣保罗市的一个小商人家庭，父亲是家具销售商。他出身贫寒，靠亲戚的资助才上了东部一所贵族预科学校。1913年秋，又在亲友的资助下考入普林斯顿大学。在校期间，他试写过剧本，曾自组剧团，并为校内文学刊物写稿。后来因身体欠佳，中途辍学。1917年美国参加第一次世界大战，菲茨杰拉德应征入伍，当了一名步兵上尉，但是没有被派往欧洲战场，而是被送到南方亚拉巴马州的蒙哥马利市近郊的军营里受训。在此期间，他认识了一位名叫姬尔达·赛尔的富家小姐，她是一位法官的女儿，身上有着南方名门闺秀的特质，是位公认的美女。他们很快坠入爱河，但是在确认他无法让她过上舒适奢华的生活后，她无情地离开了他。这件事给年轻的菲茨杰拉德沉重的打击。

1919年菲茨杰拉德退伍后去了纽约，决心发财致富，赢回姬尔达的芳心。他白天在一家广告公司工作，晚上伏案写作。后来就辞去了工作，回到父母身边，闭门创作。最终完成了他的第一部长篇小说《人间天堂》，大获成功，轰动一时。他立即前往南方，与姬尔达迅速结婚。菲茨杰拉德成名后继续勤奋笔耕，但婚后他和姬尔达的生活放荡不羁，狂欢纵乐。他们在纽约的公共喷泉池里游泳，坐在出租车的车顶上去参加宴会，与酒店里的侍者打架，甚至在餐桌上跳舞。生活变成了通宵达旦的舞会。后来他的妻子精神失常，挥霍无度，给他带来极大痛苦。他经济上入不敷出，为了维持庞大的开支，他一度去好莱坞写剧本挣钱。1936年他不幸染上肺病，妻子又一病不起，使他几乎无法创作，精神濒于崩溃，终日酗酒。1940年12月21日猝发心脏病，死于洛杉矶，年仅44岁。

菲茨杰拉德的小说生动地反映了20世纪20年代“美国梦”的破灭，展示了大萧条时期美国上层社会“荒原时代”的精神面貌。其人生经历和他的作品都可以说明，他是美国“爵士时代”的代言人，是20世纪20年代具有代表性的作家，他有成功与辉煌的一面，又有枯涩和失意的一面，曾被称为“失败的权威”。他的生命交织着雄心与现实、成功和失败、得意与潦倒、纵情与颓废、爱情与痛苦、美国文明与欧洲文明的冲突、东部与西部的冲突、梦想和幻灭……这一切都在他的小说里表现得淋漓尽致，而其中最有代表性的便是《了不起的盖茨比》，它奠定了作者在现代美国文学史上的地位。

故事发生在现代化的美国社会中上阶层的白人圈内，并通过卡洛维的叙述展开。卡洛维出生于美国中西部，后来到美国纽约学习经营股票生意，并想以此发财。他住在长岛，与故事的主人公盖茨比为邻，并与之交上了朋友。盖茨比原名盖兹，和卡洛维一样也来自中西部，他出身贫苦，但雄心勃勃，后因贩卖私酒而暴富。他经常在家举办大型豪华聚会，大宴宾客，以显示其阔绰，目的是为了吸引五年前的恋人黛西并赢回她的芳心。五年前在盖茨比服兵役时黛西曾是他的恋人，在盖茨比去海外参加第一次世界大战期间，由于利欲熏心嫁给了出身富豪家庭的纨绔子弟汤姆·布坎南。然而物欲和肉欲的满足并没能填补黛西精神上的空虚与贫乏。在卡洛维的帮助下，与盖茨比重逢后好像又旧情复燃。但黛西已不是原来的黛西，她不再是盖茨比想象中的纯情女孩，而是一个愚蠢、自私、庸俗、美丽的躯壳。盖茨比的美丽旧梦终于被打碎了，但他还在做最后的挣扎，仍对黛西抱有一丝幻想，以至遭遇了更加凄惨可悲的结局。后来黛西在一次酒后驾驶盖茨比的车时撞死了汤姆的情妇，却与汤姆一道密谋并残忍地嫁祸于盖茨比，导致死者的丈夫突然闯入盖茨比家中并开枪打死了盖茨比，然后自杀身亡，使盖茨比最终彻底成为自私而残忍的黛西的牺牲品。

《了不起的盖茨比》细腻而准确地展现了20世纪20年代美国的社会风貌，细致地描绘了当时被称为“爵士时代”的那种纸醉金迷、灯红酒绿的狂热场面。

第一次世界大战于1919年结束，美国无疑是赢家。由于美国在战争初期向交战双方提供军火，大发战争财，经济实力激增，从一个历来有债务的国家一跃成为债权国。一战后的美国进入了空前的经济繁荣和物质丰富的时代。同时，20年代的美国又充斥着社会道德的堕落，因为随着帝国主义战争实质的日益明显暴露，正义和信仰成为骗人的鬼话，战争击垮了整整一代人。在旧道德、信仰、理想的废墟上，战后的美国青年滑入了追求超前消费的享乐生活。金钱被视为高居于世间万物之上的神灵。传统的道德价值观面临挑战，而新的价值观还未形成。因此，这个时代的美国人道德堕落，精神空虚。人们梦想能一夜成为百万富翁，追求物质上的满足和及时行乐成为一种社会时尚。

《了不起的盖茨比》就描写了这样一个最纵乐、最绚丽的时代，读者从中可感到歌舞升平表面下隐藏的精神危机。在小说中，作者精心挑选了代表不同社会阶层的人物并以他们的生活反映美国20年代的社会生活。汤姆和黛西是当时旧贵族的代表。他们追求生活的优雅与情趣，精神空虚，只会用金钱去消磨打发百无聊赖的日子。他们道德堕落，自私，没有责任感，“他们是粗心大意的人，汤姆和黛西，他们毁掉了东西和人，然后就退缩到自己的金钱堆里或异乎寻常的麻木不仁之中，……，让别人去收拾他们制造的烂摊子”。盖茨比是通过自己艰苦奋斗而发家致富的新贵。他为理想而努力，感情真挚而忠诚。但他爱讲排场，喜欢炫耀，没有品位。威尔逊夫妇是下层劳动人民，他们虽辛苦劳作，生活仍然贫困，没有前途，命运悲苦。但不管这些人属于哪个社会阶层，无不崇尚金钱，追求享乐。金钱已成为美国人生活中的价值取向，成为众人生活的“新圣经”。20年代的美国成了一个唯利是图，道德沦丧的国度。

作者凭借着优美的语言，精妙绝伦的技巧呈现了新颖而深邃的内容，淋漓尽致地表现了“‘美国梦’的破灭”这一主题，堪称“美国20年代‘美国梦’破灭的一首绝唱”。“美国梦”一直是举世瞩目的理想精神之一。它源于欧洲清教徒的宗教理想信念。所谓的“美国梦”，沿用了美国文化与文学中一个约定俗成的说法，指的是在美国条件下（尤其在新大陆开拓时代）形成与发展的一种具有相当普遍吸引力的理想与追求。“美国梦”在广义上的渊源，可以追溯至当年欧洲移民来到北美披荆斩棘、开辟新的生活之路的时期，对于他们之中的许多人来说，“新大陆”甚至可以说意味着人类最后的希望。浏览一下美国的历史及美国早期的一些文学作品，我们就能够认识到早期的“美国梦”是对一个基于平等、正义和自由的国家的向往。“美国梦”的第一个体现者和鼓吹者就是本杰明·富兰克林，他编纂的《穷人理查的年历》就是第一个在美国文化史上全面地宣传了个人奋斗、发家致富的“杨基精神”，而他后来撰写的《自传》更是一本具体教诲如何实现“美国梦”的教科书。这种从18世纪诞生之时，一直到20世纪20年代，把物质上的成功归结为个人的品性与奋斗的“美国梦”，一直受到美国舆论界的大力宣扬，从而成为世世代代普通的美国人深信不疑、奋力追求的理想，同时也成了推动美国资本主义的蓬勃发展、维系资本主义社会制度的重大精神力量。

小说的主人公盖茨比是“美国梦”的继承者。他的“美国梦”起源于他的孩提时代，由于富兰克林的影响，虽然他出身贫困，在少年时代就饱受生活的辛酸，但是他一直遵循着富兰克林的教诲，从小立志，树立了远大的理想。但是社会的大环境可以从某种程度上决定一个人的世界观、价值观和人生观，那么当时的美国正处于金钱至上、享乐主义至上的社会背景之下，使得盖茨比最初的“美国梦”开始发生了质变。盖茨比有了崇尚物质的错位信仰，使得他认为只要物质上富裕了、有钱了，就能追求到爱情，拥有美满的家庭，就能充分享受到自由和美好，特别是当他遇到富家小姐黛西之后。他在第一次大战期间，与出身上流社会的黛西相遇并与她坠入爱河，但因为他们之间的贫富差距，黛西放弃了当时一名不文的盖茨比，而选择了具有贵族血统的富家子弟汤姆。这便使得盖茨比更加坚定地认为贫穷使他失去黛西，但他会用金钱把她夺回来。他这种对金钱万能的巨大的信仰，使他的“美国梦”最终变质，心中的富兰克林精神也慢慢消失殆尽。

为了得到这位富家小姐的爱情，盖茨比用了五年的时间通过一切手段积累财富，终于从社会的最底层爬到了社会的顶峰。发财后的盖茨比在黛西家的对面买下了一幢豪华别墅，经常大摆盛宴以吸引黛西，夜夜深情地守望码头对面她家门前的那盏绿灯。盖茨比一直沉浸在对初恋情人的幻想之中。此时的黛西在他脑海里已幻化成了美国的传奇故事，然而黛西并非盖茨比想象中的纯洁无瑕，使得盖茨比最终成为他的“梦”的牺牲品，他对“梦”的盲目追求决定了他命运的悲剧性。

主人公盖茨比所认为的只要通过获得对金钱的占有就能实现他的“美国梦”的想法是现实与理想之间的矛盾性的表现。因为事实远不是如他所理想的。与真诚、勇敢、执著、负有责任心的盖茨比相比，黛西只是个肤浅、造作、金钱至上的拜金女子。当黛西再次与盖茨比相遇时，她失声痛哭，虽然也是至情至性的流露，但主要原因还是在于她发现此时的盖茨比所拥有的财富比她的丈夫汤姆的还要多。然而，即使是这样黛西也不会重新回到盖茨比的身边，尤其是当汤姆揭露了盖茨比是靠违法贩卖私酒而暴富之后，面对这样一个前途岌岌可危的不法之徒，“不管她曾经有过什么意图，有过什么勇气，现在肯定都烟消云散了”。因此，当盖茨比成为她的替罪羊时，她也只是漠然对待，与汤姆一走了之。正如她的出场一样“她的声音充满了金钱……高高的在一座白色的宫殿里，国王的女儿，黄金女郎……”。从头至尾，黛西只是一个世俗的、拜金的、贪图享乐的“金姑娘”，她不可能具有和盖茨比风雨同舟、共同进退的品质，她也不具备为实现理想付出高昂代价，作出巨大牺牲的精神品质，这就注定了盖茨比的悲剧结局。

而这种悲剧的根源就在于盖茨比对生活和爱情盲目地追求与幻想，在于他对不同阶级认识的缺乏。盖茨比和黛西是出身不同的两个阶级。黛西和汤姆都属于世袭特权阶层，这就注定了他们具有冷酷、自私和堕落等这些垄断资产阶级所特有的性格特点，他们是被金钱完全同化了的一群人。他们组成了上流社会团体，妄自尊大，对下流社会所谓的暴发户极度的排斥，认为他们的钱财都是通过不合法不正当的手段所获取的，因此他们根本就看不起盖茨比这样从底层爬上来的“暴发户”，他们的世界和盖茨比的世界之间隔着一层无形的、不可逾越的网。而盖茨比却不懂得这个道理，执著地抱着他的“美国梦”不放，一味地幻想着自己的爱情，他把社会想象得太好了。在他的眼里，黛西就是上流社会精华的代表，是“像鲜花一样的为他开放”的“理想的化身”。

事实上，盖茨比的人生经历恰如其分地诠释了“美国梦”的追求过程。他的梦想，正是一个自我奋斗的普通中产阶级的理想：通过自己的努力爬到一个较高的社会地位并拥有相当的经济实力。然而，在战后的年代，这种理想纵然变成现实，也摆脱不了悲剧的结果。像盖茨比这样执著的追求者，即使获得了物质上的满足，也仍然无法逃离精神上的孤独与悲苦。盖茨比的梦就是典型的美国梦，他的奋斗体现了美国人所尊崇的坚韧、独立、向上的精神，他的失败实际上宣告了美国战后精神的颓废与衰退。物质文明的高度繁荣带给人们心灵的荒芜和扭曲，狂欢享乐的表象下隐藏着巨大的精神空虚和迷茫，整个社会陷入了无路可走的精神彷徨和痛苦之中。虽然盖茨比的梦想和现实之间的不可调和的矛盾最终使他走向毁灭，但是他的死却向世人敲响了警钟，把人们从虚无的美国梦中唤醒，激励人们从悲剧中汲取教训，以清醒的头脑重新思考社会现实，以更坚定的信念投入到现实生活之中。

《了不起的盖茨比》之所以取得如此巨大的成功，不仅仅在于它深刻的社会主题，还得益于反映这一主题的高超完美的艺术手法，尤其是象征手法的独创运用。“象征的使用，使他的作品‘超越了狭隘的个人天地，把主观与客观联系起来，放大个人经历并赋予其代表性’”。在《了不起的盖茨比》中，作者多处运用了象征手法，包括人物的象征，事物的象征和颜色的象征，其中颜色的象征着墨最多，也是最成功的。

绿色是作品频繁运用的颜色之一，也是追随主人公盖茨比一生的主色调。绿色是大自然的象征，是希望和渴求的象征。同时绿色也带有虚幻的象征意义，意味着美梦的幻灭。“绿灯”无疑是这部小说的一个重要意象，在小说发展的重要时刻共出现三次。它首次出现是在尼克从中西部来到东部不久的一个晚上。当时尼克发现他的邻居盖茨比站在月光下的草坪上，“他奇怪地朝那黑黝黝的海面伸出双臂。虽然我离他很远，但是，我敢发誓他的身子在发抖。于是我情不自禁地朝大海望去——暮色苍茫中唯见一点绿色的灯光在遥远的码头那边闪烁着”。这不仅仅是盏绿灯，它象征着他思念的情人——黛西，更象征着他对“美国梦”的追求，对美好生活的向往。第二次出现是通过尼克的帮助，盖茨比终于与思念多年的黛西见面了。然而此时的盖茨比却神情恍惚。“要不是有雾，我们可以看见海湾对面你家的房子。”盖茨比说，“你家码头的尽头，总有一盏通宵不灭的绿灯。”“绿灯”是盖茨比夜夜守护的理想，是他一生追求的幸福，但是在大雾中忽明忽暗的灯光在暗示着盖茨比理想实现的可能性越来越小。果然，盖茨比期待的伟大爱情并未出现。在对汤姆摊牌后，黛西心神不宁地驾车回家，途中撞死了汤姆的情妇——威尔逊太太。盖茨比执著于自己的梦想，替黛西承担了一切责任，而对盖茨比痛恨已久的汤姆指使威尔逊杀死了盖茨比。盖茨比死后，绿灯最后一次出现。尼克说：“他信奉这盏绿灯，这个一年一年在我们眼前渐渐远去的极乐的未来。它从前逃脱我的追求……把胳膊伸得更远一点……总有一天……”盖茨比死掉了，这意味着他对“美国梦”的追求虽然执著，但始终逃脱不了最终幻灭的结局。

白色也是作者着力运用的象征手法之一，也是追随着主要人物——黛西的主色调。黛西第一次与盖茨比见面时穿的是白色的衣服，开的是白色的跑车，这白色从表面上看是天真纯洁的象征，也正是这种貌似的纯洁、美丽、无邪吸引着盖茨比。黛西这种白衣飘飘的纯洁形象成为他追求一生，却又始终无法企及的梦想。但是在这部小说中，白色同时也是浅薄、空虚、无知、冷漠、自私的象征，这也正是黛西的实质所在，实际上也恰恰是盖茨比悲剧的根源。事实上，黛西本身就是美国梦的象征，不仅代表了盖茨比的追求，更代表了整个“爵士时代”的精神面貌，以及资产阶级虚伪的价值观和道德标准。盖茨比内心深处对纯洁的黛西的向往化为支撑他的精神支柱，然而残酷的现实再次给他以深深的打击。这也再一次地深化了“美国梦”破灭的主题。

黄色是金子的颜色，小说用黄色来象征拜金主义和腐化堕落。黛西是拜金主义的典型代表。黛西的英文名字是Daisy，意思是雏菊，一种黄心的小白花。这一名字取得极有深意，象征着金钱和空虚。黛西外表纯洁，内心空虚，灵魂充满着铜臭味。“她的声音充满金钱”；她的形象也说明其本质，虽然常着一袭白衣，却缀着铜纽扣，携带着一支小金笔。她的生活目标就是享乐，爱情也是建立在金钱之上的。盖茨比为了重新得到她的爱情，时时都在向她显示着他的富有。他在花园里举行盛大的宴会，轿车、食物、酒都是黄色的；与黛西见面时的汽车也是浅黄色的；向黛西展示的梳子也是纯金的；甚至演奏的音乐也是黄色鸡尾酒音乐。作者用黄色塑造了金钱社会的氛围。盖茨比所做的这一切都是为了重新赢得黛西，但是却忽略了，这样赢回的爱情与爱情的真谛是背道而驰的，用金钱唤回的女人得到的只能是虚情假意。他的“美国梦”从开始就是个无法实现的错误，这种错误导致了他悲剧的结局。

红色和白色是汤姆和黛西的豪宅的主色调。如果说白色象征了黛西的话，那么红色便象征着汤姆。红色展示出汤姆自私、傲慢、野蛮、残酷的个性。优越的家境使汤姆骄傲自大，目中无人。菲茨杰拉德在小说中这样描写道，他总是野蛮地推开挡在他前面的每个人，一头红色鲁莽公牛的形象跃然纸上。小说的结尾写道，当他得知妻子开车撞死自己的情人时，出于对盖茨比的忌妒，他唆使情人的丈夫残酷地杀死了盖茨比，他是真正双手沾满鲜血的凶手。到此，红色在小说中为汤姆形象的塑造画下了完美的句号。

作者在运用色彩时，并不是单纯地把色彩堆积在一起，而是根据不同的人物性格运用不同的基本色彩，随着人物心理及外部环境的变化而相应地改变色彩。色彩的巧妙运用把读者带到一个五彩的世界，使我们能更加清晰地认识到不同人物的性格，感受主人公的命运，理解作者本人的情感，探究小说所揭示的深刻的社会意义。也正是菲茨杰拉德独到的色彩象征手法的运用，促成了《了不起的盖茨比》的巨大成就，确立了菲茨杰拉德在文学史上的地位，从而使他被冠以“爵士时代的历史学家”的美誉。但是，他并不是一个旁观的历史学家，他纵情参与了“爵士时代”的奢华追逐，并将其融化到自己的作品当中。正因如此，他才能栩栩如生地重现那个时代的社会风貌、生活气息和感情节奏。更重要的是，在沉湎其中的同时，他又能冷眼旁观，用严峻的道德标准衡量一切，用凄婉的笔墨书写了战后“迷茫的一代”对“美国梦”破灭的悲哀。

如果能让她心动，那就戴顶金帽子；如果你能跳得高，就为她也跳一跳，

直到她高呼：

“情郎，戴金帽、跳得高的情郎，

我非得把你要！”

托马斯·帕克·丹维里埃1





第一章


在我少不更事，阅历不深的时候，我父亲教导过我一句话，这句话至今还在我脑海中翻腾。

“每当你想要批评别人的时候，”他对我说，“要牢记，这个世界上所有的人，并不是每个人都拥有你曾经拥有的那些优越条件。”

他没再多说别的，但是由于我们能够做到心照不宣，所以我知道他的话大有言外之意。时间一长，我就习惯于对所有的人都保留判断，这个习惯既让很多有古怪性格的人向我敞开心扉，也使得我成为很多爱发牢骚的惹人厌烦的人的倾诉对象。当这种特点在一个正常人身上表现出来的时候，心理不正常的人很快就会觉察并且紧紧抓住不放。这个缘由导致我在大学期间就被不公正地谴责为政客，因为我私下知道一些放荡不羁的无名小卒的一些秘密的忧伤往事。绝大多数的隐私都不是我刻意打听来的——每当我根据某种确凿无误的迹象意识到又有一次倾诉衷肠将要呼之欲出的时候，我时常装作昏昏欲睡，装作若有所思，或者是装出充满敌意的轻率的态度。因为我十分清楚年青人倾诉的衷肠，或者至少他们表达自己的那些情感所用的语言，通常是剽窃而来的，而且由于明显的抑制导致语意含混不清。不妄加评论是一种理想状态。我至今仍然担心会有什么闪失，唯恐我一不小心忘记了那条忠告，那条父亲以自命不凡的姿态所含蓄指出的，我现在又以自命不凡的姿态重复的忠告：基本的道德观念在人出生的时候就不是整齐划一的。

在对我的宽容做了一番自我夸耀之后，我必须承认这种宽容有个限度。人的行为可能建立在坚硬的岩石上面，也可能建立在湿软的沼泽上面，但是一旦超越了某种程度，我就不再关心它是建立在什么上面的了。去年秋天，当我从东部回来的时候，我感觉我希望全世界的人都穿上军装，并且永远在道德上保持高度一致。我不再希望以高人一等的姿态窥视人的内心世界。只有盖茨比（也就是赋予本书书名的那个人）例外，他在我的反应范围之外。盖茨比，他代表的一切都是我发自内心所鄙视的。如果人的品格是以一系列连续不断的成功的姿态出现的话，那么这个人一定是才气纵横，拥有耀眼的异彩，他对于人生前程具有高度的敏感性，如同一台能够准确记录远在万里之外的地震的精密仪器一样。这种敏感和通常被誉为“创造性气质”的优柔寡断的敏感性丝毫无关，它是一种让希望永驻的特别的天资，一种充满浪漫主义的敏捷，我在别人身上从来没有发现这种敏感性，今后也不大可能会再发现的。不，盖茨比人生的结局倒是无可非议的，使我对人们失败的痛苦和一时的欢乐暂时失去兴趣的，却是那些吞噬盖茨比心灵的东西，是在他在美梦破灭后随之而至的肮脏的尘埃。

我们家三代以来都是这个中西部城市家业昌盛的名门。卡洛维家族也算是个世家，据传我们是布克娄奇公爵的后裔，但是实际缔造我们这一支家族的是我祖父的哥哥，他于1851年来到这里，买了一个替身去参加南北战争，自己则开始了五金器具批发的生意，这个买卖直到今天我父亲仍然在经营。

我从来没见过这位伯祖父，但是大家都认为我长得像他，特别是挂在父亲办公室里的那幅板着面孔的画像可以证明。我于1915年从纽黑文毕业，恰好比我父亲毕业的时间晚四分之一个世纪，不久我就参加了有第一次世界大战之称的“被推迟的条顿民族大迁徙”。我在反击的过程中感到了无限的乐趣，回来之后就觉得无聊透顶。中西部不再是世界繁华的中心，反倒如同宇宙的凋零破败的边缘，于是我决定去东部学做证券生意。我认识的每个人都在从事证券生意，所以我觉得它多养活一个单身汉应该没有问题。我的叔伯姑姨俨然为我挑选一所预备学校一样商讨了一番之后，最后才说：“嗯……那就这样吧。”每个人都非常严肃却又迟疑。父亲答应支持我一年的花销，然后又经过几次拖延，我才在1922年春天来到东部。我想，要永远离开家乡在这里生活了。

切实可行的办法是在城里找到一处居住的地方，但那时正好是天气转暖的时节，而我又刚刚离开了有着宽阔草坪和宜人树林的地方。因此，当办公室里一个年轻人提出我们俩到近郊合租一处房子的时候，我觉得那真是一个绝妙的主意。他找到了房子，一座饱经风雨侵蚀的木板结构的带走廊的平房，每月只需付八十美元的租金，可是正准备搬进去住时，公司却把他调往华盛顿去了，我就只好独自一人搬到郊外去住了。我养了一条狗——至少在它跑掉之前我养了它几天，拥有一辆旧道奇汽车以及一个芬兰女佣，她帮我收拾床铺，做早餐，在电炉上忙碌时，嘴里总是嘟哝着芬兰的名言警句。

刚开始几天我感到孤单，直到有一天早上，一个比我更是初来乍到的人在路上拦住了我。

他很无助地问道：“到西半岛村去怎么走呢？”

我给他指了路。继续前行的时候，我不再有孤单的感觉了。我成了一个向导，一个开创者，一个早期的移民者。他无意中授予了我这一地区的荣誉市民的称号。

阳光普照大地，树木眨眼间就枝繁叶茂了，这一切如同电影里的东西长得飞快，使我心中又重现了那个熟悉的信念：生命伴随着夏天的来临而又获得新生了。

一方面，有很多的书要读，另一方面，要从这个清新宜人的空气中汲取丰富的养分。我买了十几本关于银行业、信贷和证券投资方面的书，这些立在我的书架上红色烫金封皮的书，犹如刚从造币厂印出的新钞票一样，准备揭示只有迈达斯2、摩根3和米赛纳斯4才掌握的巨大的秘密。除此之外，我还雄心壮志地准备读很多其他类别的书。我在大学的时候文笔就特别棒，曾经给《耶鲁新闻》写过一系列严肃而又平白的社论。现在我准备在我的生活中重新捡回诸如此类的东西，变成一个无所不知的通才，也就是那种博而不精的专家。这并不只是一个俏皮的警句——只从一个窗口观察人生，功成名就的机会更大。

完全由于一个偶然的机会，我租下了北美最古怪的一个社区的这所房子。这个社区位于纽约市一个狭长的喧嚣的小岛上，那里除了其他大自然奇观以外，还有形状不同寻常的两块地方。距离城市二十英里，有一对硕大的鸡蛋般的半岛，轮廓一模一样，只是中间被一个似有似无的海湾分成两部分，一直延伸到西半球那片最恬静的海洋之中——长岛海峡那个巨大的潮润的场院。它们并不是完全意义上的卵形的，而是像哥伦布故事中的鸡蛋一样，与大陆相接触的一端都被敲成扁平的了，但是它们相似的外形一定使从岛上空飞过的海鸥惊叹不已。对于没有翅膀的人类来说，一个更加富有趣味的现象，却是这两个地方除了形状和大小相同之外，在其他的每一方面都截然不同。

我住在西半岛，就是两个小岛当中不那么时髦的那个，不过这是一个非常表面化的标签，不足以揭示两者之间那种稀奇古怪而又很不吉祥的区别。我的房子紧挨鸡蛋的顶端，离长岛海峡只有五十码，并且挤在两幢大别墅中间，那是两幢每季度要付一万二到一万五租金的豪宅。我右手边的那一幢，不管按什么标准来衡量，都是一个庞然大物——它仿造诺曼底某市政厅而建，一边矗立着一座崭新的塔楼，上面稀稀疏疏地爬着一些常春藤，还有一个用大理石砌成的游泳池，以及占地四十多英亩的草坪和花园。这就是盖茨比的庄园。或者更准确地说这是一位姓盖茨比的富翁所住的庄园，因为我那时并不认识盖茨比先生。我自己的房子实在太扎眼，但是幸亏很小，没有人会注意到，因此我才有幸观赏这一片海景，欣赏我邻居大草坪的一角，并且能成为百万富翁的邻居而颇感欣慰——而所有的这一切只要每月出八十美元就可以了。

恬静的海湾对岸，在那时髦的东半岛上，那些洁白的宫殿式的豪宅，临水而建，熠熠生辉。那个夏天的故事是从我驱车去东半岛到汤姆·布坎南夫妇家做客的那个晚上才真正开始的。黛西是我的远房表妹；而汤姆，我在上大学的时候就认识他了。大战刚结束不久，我还在他们在芝加哥的家里住过两天。

黛西的丈夫，擅长多种体育运动，曾经是纽黑文有史以来闻名全国的最伟大的橄榄球运动员之一，这种人二十一岁就在某一方面达到了如此登峰造极的地步，从此以后，不论做什么，总有些走下坡路的味道了。他家里非常阔绰——还在大学时他那种挥金如土的生活方式就已经遭人指责。但现在他离开了芝加哥，搬到东部来了，他搬家的那个排场让人们惊叹不已。比方说，他竟然把老家森林湖镇5的整整一群打马球用的马匹全部运了过来。我的同辈人中竟然有人阔绰到如此地步，实在是不可思议。

我并不清楚他们来到东部的原因。他们在法国待了一年，并没有任何特殊的缘由，然后就四处飘荡，居无定所，哪儿有打马球的，哪儿有富翁，哪儿就是他们要去的地方。黛西在电话里说，这次在这定居下来，不再游荡了。可是我并不把她的话当真——黛西的心思让人难以捉摸，不过我觉得汤姆会永远飘荡下去，略有惆怅地追寻过去岁月里橄榄球比赛中的扣人心弦的激动与刺激。

于是，在一个有着徐徐清风的暖意十足的黄昏，我开车到东半岛去拜访我几近陌生的两个老朋友。他们的房子奢华程度完全出乎我的预料，那是一座色调悦目、红白相间的别墅，一派乔治王殖民统治时期的建筑风格，俯瞰着海湾。从海滩就有的草坪，一直铺展到别墅的前门，足有四分之一英里之长，一路越过日晷、砖径和百花争妍的花园——最后快要到达房子跟前时，冒出了青翠欲滴的常春藤，生机勃勃，沿墙而上。房子的正面是一排法式的落地长窗，此刻在落日余晖的映射下金光闪闪，迎着午后的阵阵暖风全都敞开着。汤姆·布坎南身穿骑装，叉着两腿站在前门的门廊（六）。

与纽黑文时代相比，他的样子已经完全变了。现在他已经是三十多岁的人了，身体强健，头发稻黄色，嘴角冷酷，举止倨傲。炯炯有神的双眼尤为突出，给人一种永远咄咄逼人的印象。就连他那像女人穿的惹人注目的骑马装也掩藏不住他那魁梧健壮的身躯——他似乎把那双雪亮的皮靴塞得满满的，鞋面上的带子都绷得紧紧的。他转动肩膀时，你可以看到一大块肌肉在他薄薄的外套下移动。这是一个力可盖世的身躯，一个残酷无情的身躯。

他说话时发出粗犷的高亢的高音，更加给人一种性情暴戾的印象。他说起话来还带着一种居高临下的轻蔑口吻，即使对他喜欢的人也同样如此。所以在纽黑文的时代，反感甚至讨厌他的人不在少数。

“我说，你可别以为对于这些问题都是我说了算，”他好像在说，“只是因为我比你力气大，比你更有男子汉气概。”我们俩是同一个高年级学生联谊会的成员，不过当时我们谈不上交往密切，但我有一种他很欣赏我的感觉，并且带着他那独一无二的粗野气息和盛气凌人的方式，希望能赢得我对他的好感。

我们在阳光明媚的门廊里聊了一会儿。

“我这地方不赖吧！”他说，他的眼睛游移不定地转来转去。

他抓住我的一只胳膊转过我的身子，挥舞着一只宽大的手掌，指点面前的景色。这里有一座凹型的意大利式花园，占地半英亩之多的香气浓郁的深色的玫瑰花，以及一艘狮子鼻状的摩托艇，随着浪潮在岸边起伏。

“这里曾经是石油大王德梅因住过的地方。”他又把我推转过身来，一派和气但又不容置辩，“我们进去吧。”

我们穿过一条高高的走廊，来到一间明亮的玫瑰色的大厅。大厅的两端都装有落地长窗，把这间屋子轻巧地嵌在这座主楼的中间。这些窗户都半开半闭着。在外面那片似乎要长到室内来的碧绿的青草的映衬下，它们显得越发晶莹光亮。一阵轻风从屋子吹过，窗帘便如一面面白色的旗帜随风而舞。窗帘在轻风的嬉戏下，从一头飘进来，又从另一头飘出去，卷曲着飞向天花板上好像糖花婚礼蛋糕似的装饰图案，然后从绛色地毯上面轻轻拂过，留下一阵如同风吹过海面时的阴影。

屋子里唯一静止不动的东西是一张庞大的长沙发，有两个年轻的女人坐在上面，简直就是飘浮在一个停泊在地面的大气球上。她们俩都身穿一身白色的衣服，衣裙随风飘荡，仿佛她们环绕房子飞了一圈刚被风吹回来似的。我一定是站了好大一会儿，倾听窗帘舞动的响声和墙上一幅挂像发出的嘎吱嘎吱的声响。忽然砰的一声，汤姆·布坎南把后面的落地窗给关上了，厅内的余风才逐渐平息下来了，窗帘、地毯以及那两位少妇也都慢慢地飘落到地面上。

她们两个中间比较年轻的那个我不曾谋面。她在长沙发的一头把身子舒展开来，并保持着一动也不动的姿势，下巴微微翘起，仿佛她在上面放了一件什么东西，必须保持身体的平衡，以防它掉下来似的。不知道她是否用余光瞥见了我，可是她毫无半点表示——相反，倒是我吃了一惊，几乎因为我的进来惊扰了她而要开口向她道歉。

黛西，其中的另外一个少妇，准备站起身来。她身子微微前倾，露出满脸的真诚。然后，她扑哧一笑，让人捉摸不透但又非常可爱。我也跟着笑了，接着就进了屋子。

“我高兴得瘫……瘫掉了。”

她又笑了，仿佛她说了一句非常幽默风趣的话，接着就把我的手拉起来，仰起脸打量我，向我保证世界上再没有其他人是她最想见到的了。她的那种表情特别与众不同。她轻声告诉我那个保持着身体平衡的姑娘姓贝克（我听人说黛西的轻声细语只是为了让人家更靠近她，但这种不相干的闲言碎语，丝毫无损于她说话时这种表情的迷人之处）。

贝克小姐的嘴唇不管怎么说还是微微动了一下，向我点了点头，轻微的几乎让人看不出来，接着又连忙把头仰了回去——她在保持平衡的那件东西很明显地动了一下，让她一惊。道歉的话又一次要从我嘴边脱口而出。几乎任何形式的我行我素总会使我感到惊叹，并且满心赞佩。

我回过头来看我的表妹，她开始用她那低微而又迷人的声音问我问题。这种声音必须侧耳倾听，似乎每一句话都是一组永远不会重新演奏的音符。她忧郁而漂亮的脸庞上荡漾着明媚的神采，一双眼睛明媚而动人，一张小嘴妩媚而热情，但是她发出的激动人心的声音，使所有倾心于她的男人都觉得难以忘怀：一种歌声般动听的魅力，一声低声柔语的“听着”，一种暗示，告诉你她片刻之前刚刚做完的一些欢悦而有趣的事情，而且下一欢悦而有趣的事情正紧随其后。

我告诉了她，在我来东部的途中，我曾在芝加哥逗留了一天，有十来个朋友都托我向她问好。

“他们想我吗？”她万分惊喜地大声喊道。

“整个城市都是凄凉的一片。所有汽车的左后轮都漆上了黑漆，作为哀悼的花圈，在城北的湖边6一带哀嚎声彻夜不停。”

“够激动人心的！汤姆，我们回去吧，明天就走。”接着她说了一句毫无关联的话：“你应当看看孩子。”

“我正想着要看看。”

“她睡着了。她三岁了。你从未见过她吧？”

“从来没有见过。”

“噢，你该看下她。她是……”

汤姆·布坎南本来一直在屋子里心神不宁地走来走去，这会儿他停了下来，把一只手放在我肩上。

“你现在在做什么买卖呢，尼克？”

“在做债券生意。”

“在哪家公司？”

我告诉了他。

“从来没听说过。”他肯定地说。

这让我感到有些不舒服。

“你会听到的，”我简短地说，“你在东部一直待下去，就会听到的。”

“噢，我肯定会在东部待下来的，不要担心。”他边说边瞄了一眼黛西，又回过头来看看我，好像他在提防着还有别的什么似的。“我要是个彻头彻尾的傻瓜，我才会住到任何别的地方去呢。”

这时贝克小姐说：“一点没错！”如此猝不及防，吓了我一跳——这是我从进屋到现在她说的第一句话。她为她自己的话也像我一样明显地吃了一惊，她打了个呵欠，接着做了一连串迅速而敏捷的动作，站了起来。

“我身子都快僵硬了，”她抱怨道，“我在那张沙发上不知躺了多长时间了。”

“别拿眼睛盯着我，”黛西反驳道，“我整整一个下午都在劝说你上纽约去。”

“不必了，谢谢，”贝克小姐对着刚从食品间端来的四杯鸡尾酒说，“我正认认真真地在进行锻炼呢。”

她的男主人看了看他，满脸的狐疑。

“是嘛！”他端起酒杯把自己的酒一饮而尽，好像那是杯中的最后一滴。“我真不明白你能干成什么事情。”

我看看贝克小姐，对她能“干成”的事感到迷惑。我饶有兴趣地看着她。她是个身材苗条、乳房小巧的姑娘，但是身板挺得笔直。由于她像个年轻的军校学员那样昂首挺胸，愈发显得身材挺拔。她用那双灰色的、由于阳光照射而眯着的眼睛也打量着我，苍白、可爱而又略带愠色的脸上流露出彬彬有礼而充满好奇心的神情。我这才想起我曾经在哪里见过她，也有可能是她的照片。

“你住在西半岛吧！”她口气轻蔑地说道，“我认识那边的一个人。”

“我一个人也不认……”

“你至少认识盖茨比吧！”

“盖茨比？”黛西追问道，“哪个盖茨比？”

还没等我来得及回答说他是我的邻居，佣人就宣布开饭了。汤姆·布坎南不由分说就把一只粗壮有力的胳膊插在我的胳膊下面，把我推出了屋子，如同把棋盘上的一个棋子推到另一格去似的。

两位女士袅袅婷婷地、娇媚懒散地把手轻轻搭在腰上，先我们一步走进一个玫瑰色的阳台。阳台迎着落日，餐桌上点燃了四支蜡烛，在渐渐平息下来的风中摇曳不定。

“为什么点蜡烛？”黛西眉头紧锁，表示不满。她用手指掐灭了蜡烛。“两个星期后就是一年中白昼最长的一天了。”她忽然又春光满面地看着我们。“你们是否一直在等待一年中白昼最长的一天，最终却还是会错过？我总是期盼着一年中白昼最长的一天，最终也还是错过了。”

“我们有个计划。”贝克小姐打着呵欠说道，仿佛要上床睡觉似的，没精打采地在桌子旁边坐了下来。

“好啊，”黛西说，“咱们做什么计划呢？”她把脸转向我，颇有些无奈地问道，“人们通常计划些什么呢？”

还没等我回答，她就两眼惊恐地盯着她的小手指。

“瞧！”她哀叹道，“我把小指碰伤了。”

我们大家都瞧了——指关节有些青紫。

“都怨你，汤姆，”她指责他说，“我知道你不是存心的，但的确是你搞的。这就是我嫁给这么个粗野的男人的报应，一个粗大笨拙的家伙……”

“我憎恨笨拙这个词，”汤姆黑着脸，反驳道，“就算开玩笑也不行。”

“笨拙。”黛西穷追不舍又来了一句。

有时她和贝克小姐一起谈笑，可是并不惹人注意，不过开点无伤大雅的玩笑，绝不是那种无休止的唠叨，就像她们的白色衣裙以及毫无杂念的超然一切的眼睛一样，说起话来平平淡淡。她们坐在这里，顾及到汤姆和我，只不过是礼貌而友好地款待我们，或者被我们招呼。她们知道晚饭一会儿就吃完了，再过一会儿夜晚也将结束了，随随便便就打发掉了。这显然迥异于西部，西部的宴会是一个阶段紧接着另一个阶段，直至推向结尾。使人总是有所期盼而又不断地感到失望，否则就担心和恐惧结尾时刻的到来。

“黛西，你让我感到自己不够文明，”我坦然承认道，此时我正在喝第二杯红葡萄酒，这酒虽然有点软木塞气味，口味却十分地道，“你不能谈谈庄稼或者其他的一些事情吗？”我说这句话并没有什么特殊的意思，但它却出人意料地被人接过去了。

“文明就要崩溃，”汤姆拔高了声调大声说，“我近来对一切事物都异常悲观。你有没有读过戈达德这个人写的《有色帝国的兴起》？”

“嗯，没有。”我答道，对他说话的语气惊诧不已。

“我说，这本书非常不错，值得每一个人细细品读。这本书的大意内容是说，如果我们白人不警觉的话，就会……就会有完全被淹没的危险。全是科学的结论，都是已经证明了的。”

“汤姆变得很博学了。”黛西脸上露出一种淡淡的忧伤，她说道，“他看一些里面有很多深奥字眼的难以理解的书。刚才那是个什么词来着，我们……”

“要我说，这些书都是有科学依据的，”汤姆固执己见，不耐烦地瞟了她一眼，“这家伙把整个道理讲得明白透彻。我们占统治地位的白种人有责任提高警惕，否则，其他人种就会掌控一切。”

“我们一定要把他们打倒。”黛西小声地说，对着炽热的太阳拼命地眨巴着眼睛。

“你们应当住到加利福尼亚……”贝克小姐开口说，可是汤姆在椅子重重地挪动了一下身子，把她的话给打断了。

“主要观点是说我们是北欧日耳曼民族。我是，你是，你也是，还有……”稍稍犹豫了一下之后，他轻轻地点了点头把黛西也算进去了；黛西又冲我眨了眨眼。“而我们创造了构成文明的一切东西——科学和艺术啦，以及其他的一切。你们能理解吗？”

他那副非常当真的架势似乎有些可怜，虽然他那种自以为是的态度比以往更为突出，但似乎对他的满足感来说已经很不够了。正在这时，房间里的电话铃响了。男管家离开了阳台去接听，黛西几乎马上就抓住这个短暂的空当把脸凑到我面前来。

“我要告诉你家里的一桩秘密，”她兴致很高地对我耳语道，“是关于男管家的鼻子的。你乐意听我讲男管家鼻子的故事吗？”

“我今晚就是抱着这个目的前来拜访的。”

“你可知道，他早先并不是什么管家。他从前在纽约专门替一个人家擦拭银器，那家有一套可供二百多人使用的银餐具。他要从早上一直擦到晚上，后来他的鼻子就承受不住啦……”

“后来情况变得越来越糟糕。”贝克小姐补充了一句。

“是的。情况变得越来越糟糕，最后他只得放弃了那份工作。”

有一小段时间，夕阳的最后一抹余晖深情而温柔地照在她那容光焕发的脸上，她的声音使我身不由己地凑上前去屏息倾听。接着，余晖渐渐消逝，每一道光都恋恋不舍地离开了她，仿佛孩子们在黄昏时刻离开欢快的街道一样难舍难分。

男管家回来时，凑在汤姆的耳边嘀咕了点什么，汤姆听了眉头一皱，把他的椅子朝后一推，一声不响就走进室内去。似乎他的离去激活了黛西内心的某种东西，她又把身子凑了过来，她的声音像歌唱似的亮丽而动听。

“在我的餐桌上见到你让我感到非常的愉悦，尼克。你使我想到一朵——一朵玫瑰花，一朵纯正的玫瑰花。难道不是吗？”她转过头来看着贝克小姐，要求她附和这句话，“是不是像一朵纯正的玫瑰花？”

这是信口开河。我一点也不像玫瑰花。她不过是随口乱说一气，但是却洋溢着一股撩人心弦的激情，仿佛她的心就躲在那些急促的、激动人心的话语背后，现在急切地想把心扉敞开。接着，她突然把餐巾往桌上一扔，说了声“对不起”就走进房子里了。

贝克小姐和我彼此交换了一下眼色，故意不露声色。我正准备说话的时候，她警觉地坐直身子，发出了“嘘”的一声警告。可以听得见那边屋子里有一阵压低的、激切的谈话声，贝克小姐就无所顾忌地探起身子，竖起两只耳朵去听。讲话的声音时隐时现，不甚连贯，一会儿低沉，一会儿又高昂，然后就完全终止了。“你刚才提到的那位盖茨比先生是我的邻居……”我开始说道。

“别吭声，让我听听出了什么事。”

“出什么事了吗？”我天真地问道。

“难道说你对此全然不知吗？”贝克小姐说，她确实感到难以置信，“我以为人人都知道了呢。”

“我可不知道。”

“唉……”她犹豫了一下说。“汤姆在纽约有个女人。”

“有个女人？”我无意识地重复了一遍。

贝克小姐点了点头。

“她至少应该顾点大体，不在吃饭的时候给他打电话。你说呢？”

我几乎还没弄懂她要表达什么，就听见一阵裙衣的颤动声和皮靴的格格声，汤姆和黛西回到了餐桌上。

“真没办法！”黛西强作欢颜大声地说。

她坐了下来，把贝克小姐和我轮番打量了一遍，又接着说：“我到外面看一会儿，外面真是浪漫极了。草坪上有一只鸟，我想它一定是搭乘‘康拉德’或者‘白星’轮船公司7的船过来的夜莺。它一直歌唱个不停……”她的声音也像唱歌一般，“很浪漫，是不是，汤姆？”

“非常浪漫。”他说，然后满脸愁容地对我说，“吃过饭要是时间还早的话，我想带你去看看我的马厩。”

这时屋里的电话又响了，大家都吃了一惊。黛西坚决地对汤姆摇了摇头，于是马厩的话题，实际上所有的话题，都烟消云散了。在关于餐桌上最后五分钟残存的片断中，我记得蜡烛又没有缘由地点着了，同时我意识到自己很想看看餐桌上的每一个人，然而却又想避开大家的目光。我无法猜测黛西和汤姆正在想什么，但是我敢肯定，即便是贝克小姐那样似乎对什么事情都了如指掌，遇事波澜不惊的人，也无法把这第五位客人尖锐刺耳的急切呼声完全置于身外的。在具有某种性情的人看来，这个局面可能倒是挺有味道的——我自己的本能反应是马上打电话报警。

不用说，关于马的事就再也没有人提起了。汤姆和贝克小姐，两人之间相隔几英尺的暮色，漫步走回书房，好像走到一个真实存在的尸体旁边去守夜。同时，我则极力装出饶有趣味，但又对周围发生的事情茫然无知的样子，跟着黛西穿过一连串的相互连接的走廊，走到前面的门廊里去。在门廊幽幽的昏暗中，我们并排坐在一张柳条编织的长靠椅上。

黛西用手捧着脸庞，似乎在摩挲她那可爱的面蛋，同时她慢慢放眼去看那天鹅绒般的暮色。我看出她内心汹涌澎湃，于是我问了几个我认为有镇静作用的问题，都是关于她小女儿的。

“我们相互之间了解到并不多，尼克，”她忽然说，“虽然我们是表亲。我结婚时你没参加我的婚礼。”

“那时我还在打仗，还没回来。”

“没错。”她迟疑了一下，“哎，我的生活一团糟，尼克，所以我现在对一切都毫无兴致了。”

显然，她持有这种态度是有缘由的。我等着听她接着往下讲，可是她没再说什么，过了一会儿我又支支吾吾地把话题转回了她女儿身上。

“我想她一定会说话了，又……会吃饭了，什么都会了吧。”

“呃，是啊。”她心神不定地看着我，“听我说，尼克，让我告诉你她出生的时候我说了些什么。你想听听吗？”

“很想听。”

“你听了就会明白我为什么对所有事物都持有这种态度。孩子出生还不到一个小时，汤姆就消失得无影无踪了。我从乙醚麻醉中醒过来就有一种被彻底抛弃的感觉，于是立即问护士是男孩还是女孩。她告诉我是个女孩，我就侧过脸哭了起来。‘好吧，’我说，‘我很高兴是个女孩。而且我希望她以后是个傻瓜，是一个美丽的小傻瓜。这就是女孩子在这种世界上最好的出路。’”

“你看，反正一切在我眼中都是糟糕透顶了的，”她坚信不疑地接着说，“所有的人都这样认为——就连那些最为进步的人也是如此。而我知道。我什么地方都去过了，什么事情也都经历过了，什么也都做过了。”她双眼炯炯有神，目空一切的环顾四周，极似汤姆，接着她又发出一阵让人不寒而栗的讥笑。“长于世故……天哪，我已经变得相当世故了！”

她的话音刚落，不再逼迫我集中精力去听她讲话，去相信她的话时，我便立即感到她的言语并非发自内心。这让我感到很不自在，仿佛整个晚上都是一个骗局，设置此局的目的就是为了骗取我的一份感情。我静静地等着，果然过了一会，她注视着我时，那张漂亮的脸蛋上浮现出千真万确的假笑，仿佛她在确切的告诉人们，她已经加入一个她和汤姆同属的上流社会的著名秘密社团。

里面那间绯红色的房间灯火通明。汤姆和贝克小姐坐在一个长沙发的两头。她在给汤姆朗读《星期六晚邮报》，声音低沉，没有变化，一连串的字句听上去给人一种安心的感觉。灯光映在他的皮靴上闪闪发亮，照在她如秋叶般黄色的头发上则暗淡无光，每当她翻页时，手臂上纤细的肌肉也随着颤动，灯光也在报纸上摇曳。

我们进屋时，她举起一只手示意我们先别讲话。

“未完待续，”她读着把杂志丢在桌子上，“请读本刊下期。”

她抖动了一会膝盖，身子挺直地站了起来。

“10点了，”她说道，好像从天花板上看到了时间，“我这个乖女儿要去睡觉了。”

“乔丹明天要去参加锦标赛，”黛西解释说，“在韦斯切斯特那边。”

“哦，原来你是乔丹·贝克。”

这下我才明白为什么看着她很面熟了。她那张讨人喜欢又略有傲气的面孔，我曾经多次在报道阿希维尔、温泉和棕榈海滩8的许多赛事的报刊照片上看到过。我还听说过有关她的传闻，一些尖酸的、带有讽刺性的闲话，但具体是什么，我老早就不记得了。

“晚安，”她柔声说，“8点喊我，好吗？”

“只要你能起得来。”

“没问题。晚安，卡洛维先生。下次再见。”

“你们当然会再见面的，”黛西肯定地说，“说句实话，我想做个媒。尼克，经常过来玩，我会想法子——呃——撮合你们的。比如碰巧把你们关进壁柜里，或者是把你们放在小船上，往大海里一推，类似这样的事情……”

“晚安，”贝克小姐在楼梯上喊道，“我可是一个字都没有听到。”

“她是个好女孩儿，”过了一会，汤姆说，“他们不该让她这样在全国各地乱跑。”

“你说是谁不该？”黛西冷冷地问道。

“她家里人。”

“她家里只有一位年迈的姨妈。再者，尼克将来可以去照顾她，是吗，尼克？她今年夏天会常来这里度周末，我想这里的家庭氛围会对她有益处的。”

黛西和汤姆默默地对视了一会儿。

“她是纽约人吗？”我急忙问道。

“是路易斯维尔9人。我们在那里共同度过了纯真的少女时代，我们那纯洁美丽的……”

“你是不是在阳台上和尼克说了贴心话了？”汤姆突然质问道。

“我说了吗？”她望着我，“我好像不记得了，但是我想我们聊到了日耳曼民族。是的，我确定我们聊到了这个话题，不知不觉地聊上了它，总是这样……”

“尼克，不要轻信你听到的任何事情。”汤姆告诫我。

我轻描淡写地说我啥也没有听到，几分钟后我站起来准备回家。他们把我送到门口，两人并肩站在一块明亮的方块形的灯光里。当我发动汽车要走时，黛西突然不容辩解地叫道：“等一下！”

“一件非常重要的事情，我忘了问你。听说你跟西部的一位女孩订婚了。”

“是的，”汤姆和气地附和道，“我们听说你订婚了。”

“那是无中生有。我太穷了。”

“但是我们听说了，”黛西坚持道，再次像花儿一样笑逐颜开，这让我大吃一惊。“我们听三人说起过，所以肯定错不了。”

我当然知道他们讲的是什么事，但是我确实没有订婚。我之所以来东部，原因之一就是流言蜚语广为流传，说我订婚了。你不能因为害怕谣传就不和老朋友来往了，另一方面，我也不愿迫于人们的闲言碎语而结婚。

他们的关心让我深受感动，而且也让他们显得不再那么富有和高不可攀了。即便如此，在我开车离去的时候，仍然感觉有些困惑，同时还有点厌恶。在我看来，黛西应该做的事是：抱着孩子冲出屋子——可是很明显，在她的大脑里没有一点这种想法。至于汤姆，他“在纽约有个女人”这事倒不奇怪，让人感到奇怪的是他居然会因为一本书而神情沮丧。某种东西正在使他对那些陈腐的观念感兴趣，且孜孜以求，好像他那健壮的体魄中蕴含的自高自大已经不能继续滋养他那专横武断的心灵了。

路边小旅馆的屋顶上，以及路边的加油站的门前已经展现出一派盛夏的景致，加油站前一台台崭新的红色油泵卧在一圈圈的灯影里。回到西半岛的住处后，我把车停在车棚里，在院子里的一台废弃了的割草机上坐了一会。风已经平息了，留下了一个喧哗、明亮的夜晚，有鸟儿在树上拍打着翅膀，还有大地的风箱铆足了劲头吹得青蛙也卖力的聒噪起来，好像那连绵不断的风琴声。月光下，有只猫的侧影在慢慢地移动，我回过头来看它时，发现此时此地并非只有我一个人——五十英尺之外，从我邻居的府邸的阴影里走出来一个人。他站在那里，两手插在口袋里，仰望着繁星闪烁的夜空。那悠闲的举止和那双脚稳踏在草坪上的姿势表明他就是盖茨比先生；他走出来想确定一下，我们头顶的天空哪一片是属于他的。

我决定和他打声招呼。刚才吃晚饭时，贝克小姐提到过他，可以算是对他的介绍。可是我并没有招呼他，他不愿有人打扰他的清净，因为他突然做了个动作——以奇怪的方式朝着幽暗的海面伸出双臂。我敢发誓他在发抖，尽管离我很远。我不由地朝海面上望去，结果除了一盏孤独的绿灯外，什么也没有。灯光微弱而且遥远，也许那就是一座码头的尽头。等我回过头来再去看盖茨比时，他已经不见了，剩下我一个人，孤单地留在这不平静的夜色里。





第二章


在西半岛和纽约之间大概一半路程的地方，公路与铁路不期而遇，然后两条道路并行了四分之一英里的路程，以绕开一片荒芜的土地。那是一个灰烬的山谷，一个神秘的农场，在这里，灰烬像麦子一样疯长，长成山脊、山丘和奇形怪状的园子；最后经过奇特的造化，又堆成了一群土灰色的人。他们似乎隐隐约约的走动着，在尘土飞扬的空气中化为灰烬。偶尔，一长溜灰色的货车沿着一条看不见的轨道缓慢爬行，突然嘎吱一声如鬼叫般，停了下来，立刻，一群土灰色的人群拖着沉重的铁铲蜂拥而上，扬起一片浓密的尘土，使你看不清楚他们究竟在干什么。

但是，在这片灰蒙蒙的土地和始终笼罩在它上空的一阵阵暗淡的尘埃上面，过一会儿，你就会看到T.J.埃克尔堡大夫的眼睛；他的眼睛是蓝色的，而且很大，仅瞳仁就有一码高。这双眼睛不是长在什么的人脸上往外看，而是从一副巨大的黄色眼镜下往外看，眼镜架在一个不存在的鼻子上。显然，这是某个爱异想天开的眼科医生把他们竖在那里的，想为他自己在皇后区的诊所招徕更多的生意。到后来他自己也永远闭上了眼睛，或者是扔下它们搬走了。但是，他留下的那双眼睛，由于经历长年累月的雨淋日晒，油漆脱落，光彩大不如以前，不过仍然若有所思地、阴郁地注视着这片幽暗的垃圾场。

在这个灰土谷的边上有一条肮脏的小河，每逢河上的吊桥拉起，让驳船通过的时候，等着过桥的火车上的乘客就要盯着这片荒凉的景色，看上半个小时。平时火车开到这里，至少要停一分钟，正是由于这个原因，我才第一次见到汤姆·布坎南的情妇。

他有个情妇，这是所有认识他的人都确定的事实。他的熟人对他很反感，因为他常常带着她去那些大众餐馆，把她扔在餐桌边，自己则到处走来走去，跟他熟识的人聊天。我出于好奇，想看看她，但并不想和她见面——可我还是与她碰面了。一天下午，我和汤姆一起乘火车去纽约。路上火车停在了灰堆旁，他立即跳了起来，拽住我的胳膊，硬是把我拉下了火车。

“我们就在这儿下车，”他斩钉截铁地说，“我要你见见我的女朋友。”

我想他可能是午饭时酒喝多了，所以才坚决要我陪他，甚至差点要动用武力。他自以为是地认为星期天下午我没有什么重要的事情要做。

我跟着他翻过一道低矮的刷成白色的铁路栅栏，在埃克尔堡大夫目不转睛地注视下，我们沿着马路往回走了一百码。映入眼帘的唯一的建筑物，是一排坐落在荒原边上的黄砖小楼，好像是为整个荒原服务的一条小型商业“主街”10，周边空无一物。这里共有三家店铺，一家正在招租；另一家是通宵餐馆，门前有一条炉渣铺成的小路；第三家是汽车修理行，招牌上写着：汽车修理——乔治·B.威尔逊——买卖汽车。我跟着汤姆走了进去。

车行里生意很不景气，空荡荡的，唯一看见的一辆车，是一部落满灰尘、破烂不堪的福特车，蜷缩在阴暗的角落里。我突然想到，这家有名无实的车行一定只是个幌子，楼上却隐藏着豪华而且富有情调的房间；这时，老板出现在一间办公室的门口，用一块抹布不停地擦着手。他一头金发、无精打采、脸色蜡白，但模样倒还俊俏。一见到我们，他那双淡蓝色的眼睛里就闪现出一丝暗淡的希望。

“你好，威尔逊，老伙计，”汤姆说着，一面笑嘻嘻地拍着他的肩膀，“生意好吗？”

“还凑合，”威尔逊回答道，显然不能让人信服。“你什么时候把那部车卖给我？”

“下周吧，我现在让人正修着呢。”

“他干得可真慢，是吧？”

“不，不慢，”汤姆冷冷地说，“如果你那样想的话，也许我还是把它卖到别处去比较好。”

“我不是这意思，”威尔逊连忙辩解，“我只是说……”

他的声音逐渐消失，汤姆显得不耐烦，眼睛向车行四下张望。这时，我听到楼梯上传来一阵脚步声，不一会儿，一个身材略显粗壮的女人站在了办公室的门口，把光线挡了个严严实实。她大约三十五六岁，略显发福，不过像有些女人一样形体丰满而且有魅力。她穿了一件沾有油渍的深蓝色双绉连衣裙，脸蛋谈不上有多漂亮，但一眼就能看出她有一股活力，好像她全身的神经都在不停地燃烧。她不慌不忙地微微一笑，旁若无人地从她丈夫的身边走过，仿佛他只是一个幽灵，过来和汤姆握手，眼睛凝视着他。接着，她润了润嘴唇，头也不回，用一种低低地、沙哑的嗓音对她丈夫说：“搬几把椅子过来，你怎么不让人家坐下。”

“哦，就去拿。”威尔逊急忙应和着，朝小办公室走去，随即他的身影就与墙壁的水泥色融为一体了。灰白色的尘土蒙在了他的深色的外套和淡黄色的头发上，笼罩着周围的一切——他的妻子除外。她走到汤姆身边。

“我想见你，”汤姆急切地说道，“乘下班火车走。”

“好吧。”

“我在车站底层的报摊旁边等你。”

她点了点头，刚从他身边走开，威尔逊正好从办公室里搬了两张椅子出来。

我们在公路上没人看见的地方等她。再过几天就是7月4号11了。有一个灰头土脸、骨瘦如柴的意大利孩子正在沿着铁轨，点放一排“鱼雷”的鞭炮玩。

“这地方真糟糕，是不是？”汤姆说着，同时冲着埃克尔堡大夫皱了皱眉头。

“太糟了。”

“对她来说，还是离开这儿比较好。”

“她丈夫不反对吧？”

“威尔逊？他以为她是去纽约看她妹妹。他笨得要死，连自己是死是活，都不清楚。”

就这样，汤姆·布坎南和他的情人，还有我一起坐上了去纽约的火车——其实不算是完全在一起，因为威尔逊太太很谨慎地坐到另外一节车厢里了。汤姆做出了这点让步，怕碰到其他东半岛的人也乘坐这趟车。

威尔逊太太已经换上了一件棕褐色的薄纱花裙。车到了纽约，汤姆扶她下车时，她那肥大的臀部把衣服绷得紧紧的。在报摊上，她买了一份《城市闲话》和一本电影杂志，又在车站的杂货店里买了一瓶冷霜和一小瓶香水。来到了车站的上层，在那阴暗的、回声隆隆的车道旁边，她放过了四辆出租车后，才选择了一辆浅紫色的、装有灰色座套的新车。我们坐着这辆车，驶出庞大的车站，驶进灿烂的阳光里。可是，她猛地从车窗边转过头来，身子往前一倾，敲了敲前面的玻璃。

“我想买一只那样的小狗。”她急切地说，“我想买一只养在公寓里，挺有意思的——养只狗。”

我们把车子往后倒，停在了一位满头银发的老头跟前，搞笑的是，这老头长得有点像约翰·D.洛克菲勒12。他脖子上挂了一个篮子，里面蜷缩着十几只刚出生的小狗，看不出是什么品种。

“这些狗是什么品种？”老头刚走到汽车窗前，威尔逊太太就急切地问道。

“各个品种都有。太太，您想要哪一种？”

“我想要只警犬，我看你不一定有这一种吧？”

老头疑惑地看了看篮子里的小狗，然后伸手进去，捏着一只小狗的颈背拎了起来，小狗直扭着身子。

“这不是警犬。”汤姆说。

“对，这不是正宗的警犬，”老头说，声音里透着失望，“看上去好像是只硬毛猎狗。”他用手抚摸着狗背上像棕色浴巾似的皮毛。“瞧瞧这毛，真是一身好毛皮！你可以放心，这狗绝对不会感冒的。”

“这狗真讨人喜欢，”威尔逊太太兴高采烈地说，“多少钱？”

“这只狗吗？”老头爱怜地看着它，“你给10美元吧。”

这只硬毛猎狗——毫无疑问，它的身上有那么一点像硬毛猎狗的地方，不过它的爪子却出奇的白——就这样换了主人，坐到了威尔逊太太的大腿上。她高兴地抚摸着小狗那身不怕风吹雨打的皮毛。

“这只狗是雄的还是雌的？”她委婉地问。

“那只狗吗？是雄的。”

“是只母狗，”汤姆肯定地说道，“给你钱，用这钱可以再去买上10只狗。”

我们坐着车子来到了第五大道，在这个夏日的星期天下午，天气温暖和煦，简直是一派田园风光。这时候，即使在街角拐出来一大群雪白的绵羊，我也不会感到吃惊。

“停一下，”我说，“我要在这儿和你们分手了。”

“不行，你不能走，”汤姆急忙插话说，“如果你不上我们的公寓去，梅特尔会生气的。是吗，梅特尔？”

“来吧，”她劝道，“我会打电话让我妹妹凯瑟琳过来，很多有眼光的人都说她是个大美人。”

“嗯，我很想去，不过……”

车子继续往前开，又掉头穿过中央公园，径直朝西城一百多号街13的方向驶去。在158号街上，出租车在一长排好似雪白的蛋糕似的公寓中的一栋前面停了下来。威尔逊太太环视了一下四周，俨然皇后回宫，抱起她的小狗和其他路上买来的东西，趾高气扬地走了进去。

“我马上就请麦基夫妇上来，”在乘电梯上去时，她一本正经地说，“另外，当然，我也会给我妹妹打电话。”

他们的那套房子在公寓楼的顶层——一间小客厅，一间小餐厅，一间小卧室和一个卫生间。一套很大的织锦装饰的家具，把小客厅挤得满满当当的，一直顶到了门口，以至于在室内走动时，经常要撞到绘在装饰布上的风景画上去——一幅凡尔赛宫里仕女荡秋千图14。墙上唯一的装饰画是一张放得很大的照片，猛一看，是一只老母鸡蹲在一块模糊不清的石头上。可是，远远看去，母鸡却变成了一顶帽子，帽子下面是一位胖老太太的脸，正满面含笑地俯视着房间。桌子上放了几本过期的《城市闲话》，还有一本《名字叫彼得的西蒙》15的流行小说以及几本专门报道百老汇丑闻的杂志。威尔逊太太首先关心的是那只小狗。她好说歹说让电梯工弄来了一只铺满稻草的纸箱子和一些牛奶。他还主动带来了一听又大又硬的狗饼干——从里面取出来的一块放在一碟牛奶里，泡了一个下午，泡烂了。这时，汤姆打开了一个上锁的柜子，取出了一瓶威士忌。

这一辈子我只醉过两次，第二次就是那天下午。所以那天下午发生的一切都是模模糊糊的，仿佛云里雾里一样，尽管到了晚上8点之后，房间里还洒满了绚烂的阳光。威尔逊太太坐在汤姆的大腿上，给好几个人打了电话。后来香烟没了，我便去街角的杂货店买了几包。等我回来的时候，他们俩都不见了，于是我很知趣地坐在客厅里，阅读了《名字叫彼得的西蒙》中的一章——也许是书写得太烂了，也可能是我威士忌喝多了头昏脑胀的，反正是我啥也没有看明白。

汤姆和梅特尔（第一杯酒下肚后，我和威尔逊太太就开始互相直呼名字了）重新露面的时候，客人们开始陆续上门了。

威尔逊太太的妹妹是个30岁左右，苗条而又俗气的女人，披着一头又硬又密的红头发，脸上粉抹得像牛奶一样白。她的眉毛是拔过后又画上的，勾勒出一个更俏皮的眉尖，可是自然的力量却要恢复原来的样子，结果弄得她的脸部有点模糊不清了。她一走动，手臂上戴着的许多陶制手镯跟着忽上忽下，叮叮当当作响。她轻车熟路地快步走了进来，像主人一样环视了一番屋里的家具，仿佛这就是她自己的家一样。我不禁怀疑她是不是住在这里。但是等我问她时，她放声大笑，高声重复了我的问题，然后告诉我她和一个女伴同住在一家旅馆里。

麦基先生住在楼下，是一位皮肤白净、有点娘娘腔的男人。他刚刚刮过胡子，脸颊上还留有一点白色的肥皂沫。他彬彬有礼地同屋里每一个人打招呼。他告诉我他是“玩艺术的”，后来我才弄明白他是摄影师，挂在墙上的那幅威尔逊太太母亲的模糊不清的照片，就是他给放大的。他妻子声音尖细，没精打采，虽面容清秀，却不讨人喜爱。她自豪地告诉我，自从结婚以来，她的丈夫已经为她拍过127次照片了。

威尔逊太太不知何时换了一套衣服，现在穿的是一件做工精致的下午装，是一件乳黄色雪纺绸的连衣裙；她在屋里来回走动时，衣裙不停地沙沙作响。穿上这身高档衣服后，她的神情举止变了。在车行里她那种给人印象深刻的活力，此时变成了目空一切的傲慢。她的笑声、举止、言谈都变得越来越做作，随着她的不断膨胀，周围的空间就显得越来越小，到了最后，她似乎在烟雾缭绕的空气中，围绕着一根吱吱嘎嘎作响的木轴旋转了起来。

“亲爱的，”她提高嗓门，装腔作势地对她妹妹说，“这年头的人多半都是骗子。他们满脑子想的只有钱。上个星期我找了个女人来给我看脚。瞧她给我的账单，你会以为她给我割了阑尾呢。”

“那女人叫什么？”麦基太太问道。

“埃伯哈特太太，她专门到人家中给人看脚。”

“我喜欢你这件衣服，”麦基太太说，“我觉得挺漂亮。”

威尔逊太太眉毛往上一挑，非常不屑地拒绝了她的恭维。

“这只是一件破衣服，”她说，“我不在乎自己的形象的时候，就会随便穿穿它。”

“但是穿在你身上就显得非常漂亮，你明白我的意思吗？”麦基太太接着说道，“要是切斯特能把你现在的姿态拍下来，我想那一定会是一幅杰作。”

大家都默不作声地看着威尔逊太太，她把一缕头发从眼前撩开，乐呵呵地回头看着我们。麦基先生侧着头，聚精会神地打量了她一会，接着又伸出一只手在自己面前慢慢地来回移动。

“我得改换一下光线，”过了一会，他说道，“我想把她面貌的立体感呈现出来。还要想法子抓拍到她后面的头发。”

“我认为没必要改换光线，”麦基太太大声叫道，“我觉得……”

她丈夫“嘘”了一声，我们大家又把目光转向了摄影的对象，这时，这时汤姆·布坎南大声打了一个呵欠，站了起来。

“麦基先生和麦基太太，你们喝点什么吧！”他说道，“再来点冰块和矿泉水吧，梅特尔，不然大家都快睡着了。”

“我早就让那小子送冰块来了。”梅特尔眉毛一扬，对下人的偷懒表示无奈，“这些人哪，非要整天盯住他们不可。”

她看了我一眼，突然莫名其妙地笑了笑。接着，她蹦蹦跳跳来到小狗跟前，抱起它欣喜若狂地吻了一阵。然后大摇大摆地走进厨房，那架势好像有十几个大厨师在那儿听她的吩咐呢。

“我在长岛那边拍了一些不错的照片。”麦基先生自信地说道。

汤姆茫然地看了他一眼。

“有两幅我们已经装裱好，挂在楼下了。”

“两幅什么？”汤姆问道。

“两幅摄影习作。其中一幅我给它起名叫《蒙塔海角——海鸥》，另一幅名为《蒙塔海角——大海》。”

威尔逊太太的妹妹凯瑟琳紧挨着我坐到了沙发上。

“你也在长岛住吗？”她问我。

“我住在西半岛。”

“是吗？大约一个月前，我到那里参加过一次聚会。在一位名叫盖茨比的家里，你认识他吗？”

“我就住在他家隔壁。”

“哦，人家说他是德国威廉皇帝的侄儿或是表弟什么的，他的钱都是从那儿来的。”

“真的吗？”

她点了点头。

“我很怕他。不喜欢跟他有什么瓜葛。”

关于我邻居的这场引人入胜的闲扯，被麦基太太打断了，她突然用手指着凯瑟琳说道：“切斯特，我想你可以给她拍几张好的照片。”她随口而出，但麦基先生只是不耐烦地点点头，又把注意力转向了汤姆。

“我很想在长岛上开展业务，要是我有机会能挤进那里的话，我只是希望有人能在开始时扶我一把。”

“这事你问梅特尔好了。”汤姆哈哈笑道，此时威尔逊太太正好端了个托盘走了进来，“她可以帮你写封介绍信，是吗，梅特尔？”

“做什么？”她问道，一脸诧异。

“你给麦基先生写封介绍信去见你丈夫，这样他就可以给他拍些写真。”他停了一下，动了动嘴唇，没有出声，接着胡诌道：“《乔治·威尔逊在加油泵前》，诸如此类的东西。”

凯瑟琳凑近我，在我耳边低语说：“他们俩谁都无法忍受自己家里的那一位。”

“是吗？”

“无法忍受。”她看看梅特尔，又看看汤姆。“我说的意思是，既然没法忍受，为什么还要继续生活在一起呢？如果是我，我就离婚，然后立即就各自再结婚。”

“她也不喜欢威尔逊吗？”

这个问题的回答出乎意料。梅特尔凑巧听到了这个问题，粗声粗气又满嘴脏话地回答了。

“你瞧，”凯瑟琳得意洋洋地叫道，她再次压低了嗓门，“他们之所以不能结婚是因为他老婆。她是天主教徒，他们是不赞成离婚的。”

黛西并不是天主教徒，我对这个精心编织的谎言感到有些震惊。

“等到哪天他们要结婚了，”凯瑟琳继续说，“他们会去西部住上一段时间，直到这场风波平息了。”

“到欧洲去会更稳妥。”

“噢，你喜欢欧洲吗？”她惊呼起来，“我刚从蒙特卡洛16回来。”

“是吗？”

“就在去年。我和另外一个女孩一起去的。”

“待了很久吗？”

“没多久，我们到了蒙特卡洛就回来了。我们是取道马赛去那里的。出发时，我们带了1200美元，在赌场的包间里，仅待了两天，钱就被全骗光了。跟你说吧，我们回来的路上特别狼狈。天哪，我恨死那个鬼地方了！”

窗外，傍晚的天空在夕照中显得格外壮观，犹如地中海碧蓝而又恬静的海水。这时，麦基太太那尖锐刺耳的嗓音，再次把我唤回到这间屋子里。

“我差点也犯了一个错误，”她精神抖擞地大声说道。“我差点嫁给了一位追了我好多年的犹太小伙子。我知道他配不上我。大家都不停地对我说：‘露西尔，那个人比你差远了！’不过，如果我没有遇到切斯特，他肯定就把我追到手了。”

“不错，可是听我说，”梅特尔·威尔逊说着，一面不停地摇头晃脑，“好在你没有嫁给他。”

“我明白我不该嫁给他。”

“唉，可是我嫁给了他，”梅特尔含糊其辞地说道，“这就是你和我情况不同的地方。”

“可你为什么要嫁给他呢，梅特尔？”凯瑟琳追问道，“又没人强迫你。”

梅特尔思索了一会儿。

“我嫁给他是因为我原以为他是一个绅士，”她最后说，“我以为他有点教养，谁想他连舔我的鞋子都不配。”

“有一阵子，你可是爱他爱得发疯。”凯瑟琳说。

“爱他爱得发疯！”梅特尔难以置信地喊起来。“谁说我爱他爱得发疯啦？我对他的爱从来都没比这个男人的爱多一点。”

她突然指着我，于是屋里的人，都用责备的目光盯着我。我竭力用表情告诉他们，我不期望有谁会疼爱我。

“我唯一一次发疯就是我嫁给了他。我马上就知道自己犯了错误。结婚时他穿的最好的一套西装，是借的别人的，却从来没有告诉过我，后来有一天他不在家，那人来要回衣服。‘哦，这套西服是你的吗？’我说，‘我还是第一次听说。’但是我还是把衣服还给了那人，然后一头栽倒在床上，号啕大哭了一个下午。”

“她确实应该离开他，”凯瑟琳接着对我说，“他们在那个修车行楼顶上住了11年了。汤姆是她的第一个情人。”

那瓶威士忌——已经是第二瓶了——大家都不停地喝着，唯有凯瑟琳除外，她“不喝酒也感觉挺快活”。汤姆按铃把看门的叫上来，让他去买一种出名的三明治，当做大家的晚餐。我想出去到外面散散步，在外面柔和的暮色中往东朝公园那边去，但每次我起身要走的时候，总会被卷进一场激烈刺耳的争吵中，像有根绳子一样把我拉回到椅子上。在城市的上空，高悬着我们这一排亮着灯光的窗户，一定会给那些在黑暗的街道上偶尔抬头仰望的行人，提供一点人生的秘密吧。而我同样也是这样的一位行人，一面仰望着天空，一面在思考着。我既身在其中又身在其外，对人生的变幻无穷和五彩斑斓，既感到陶醉又感到厌恶。

梅特尔把她的椅子拉到我的跟前，突然向我讲起了她第一次邂逅汤姆的情形，我能感觉到她呼出的热乎乎的气息。

“故事发生在火车上经常剩下的最后两个面对面的小座位上。那天我去纽约看我妹妹，准备在那过一夜。他穿着一身礼服，一双黑漆皮鞋，我一看到他，眼睛就离不开他了。但是每次他一看我，我又不得不假装看他头顶上的广告。我们走进车站时，他就紧挨在我身边，他那雪白的衬衫前胸紧贴着我的胳膊，于是我告诉他说我要喊警察了，不过，他看出来我在撒谎。我神魂颠倒地跟着他上了一辆出租汽车，还以为是上了地铁哩。那会儿，我脑子里一遍又一遍问自己：‘能长相厮守吗？能长相厮守吗？’”

她转向麦基太太，她那矫揉造作的笑声充满了整个屋子。

“亲爱的，”她叫道，“这套衣服我换下来就送给你。明天我再去买件新的。我得把所有要办的事情列个单子。按摩、烫发、替小狗买条项圈，还要买一个可爱的小烟灰缸，一按弹簧就可以掐灭烟头的那种，再为母亲的墓碑买一个系黑丝结的花环，可以摆上一个夏天的那种。我要把这些事情都写下来，免得忘掉要办的事情。”

9点钟了，一转眼我再看手表时，已经是10点了。麦基先生已经倒在椅子上睡着了，拳头攥得紧紧地放在大腿上，好像一个实干家的照片。我掏出手帕，帮他擦掉残留在他脸颊上的已经干掉了的肥皂沫，它让我一下午都不舒服。

那只小狗趴在桌子上，双眼在烟雾中茫然地望着，不时地轻轻哼一声。房间里的人一会儿不见了，一会儿又重新出现，商量着到什么地方去，然后又找不着对方了，找来找去，发现对方就在身边。快到半夜的时候，汤姆·布坎南和威尔逊太太面对面站着，在激烈地争吵着威尔逊太太是否有权利提黛西的名字。

“黛西！黛西！黛西！”威尔逊太太大声喊叫。

“我想什么时候叫就什么时候叫！黛西！黛……”

汤姆·布坎南身手矫健，伸手一巴掌打破了威尔逊太太的鼻子。

接着，卫生间的地板上扔满了带血的纸巾，屋子里响起了女人们的责骂声，在一片混乱中，还有一阵阵长时间的，时断时续的痛苦的哀号声。麦基先生从睡梦中醒来，恍恍惚惚地向门口走去。走到一半，他又折了回来，呆愣愣地望着这眼前的一幕——他妻子和凯瑟琳一边责骂一边安慰，手里拿着急救用品，在拥挤的家具中间，跌跌撞撞地来回穿行着。还有那个躺在沙发上的绝望的身影；她血流不止，仍不忘把一份《城市闲话》盖在织有凡尔赛宫图案的织锦毯上。麦基先生随后转过身子，继续往前走出门去，我从衣架上取下帽子，也跟着走了出去。

“哪天过来一起吃顿午饭吧。”我们乘着嘎吱作响的电梯下楼时，他提议道。

“什么地方？”

“随便什么地方。”

“不要碰电梯开关。”电梯工冷不丁地迸出一句。

“对不起，”麦基先生不失尊严地说，“我不知道自己碰到了它。”

“好的，”我答应说，“我很乐意前往。”

……我站在麦基先生的床边，而他坐在两层床单当中，穿着内衣，手里捧着一本大相册。

“《美女与野兽》……《孤独》……《杂货店老马》……《布鲁克林大桥》……”

之后，我躺在了宾夕法尼亚车站冰冷的下层候车室里，半睡半醒，一边看着早晨刚出的《论坛报》，一边等候着四点的那班火车。





第三章


整个夏天，每晚都有音乐声从我邻居家飘过来。在他那蓝色的花园里，红男绿女像飞蛾一样，在欢声笑语、香槟美酒和灿烂星空的气氛里来来往往。下午涨潮的时候，我看到他的客人从搭在木筏上的高台上跳水，或者是在他那晒得发烫的私人沙滩上晒日光浴，同时他的两艘摩托艇拖着滑水板，划破海湾的水面，驶过奔腾的浪花，奋力向前。每到周末，他的劳斯莱斯豪华轿车就成了公共汽车，从早晨9点直到深更半夜往来穿梭，接送一批批从城里来的客人。而他的那辆旅行车像一只轻盈的黄色甲壳虫一样蹦来蹦去到火车站接所有的班次。到了周一，八个仆人，外加一个临时园丁，用拖把、板刷、榔头、修枝剪刀辛苦地干上一整天，收拾前天晚上聚会留下的一片狼藉。

每周五，就会有五箱橙子和柠檬从纽约的水果店运到这里。到了周一，这些被切成半拉半拉的，榨过汁的橙子和柠檬就会像金字塔一样地堆在他家的后门口。他家的厨房里有一台榨汁机，半小时之内就可以榨两百只橙子，只要男管家用大拇指把一个按钮按两百次就可以了。

至少每两周一次，一帮承办宴会的人从城里赶来，带着几百英尺长的篷布和足够数量的彩灯，把盖茨比的巨大花园装扮得同圣诞树一样漂亮。自助餐桌上，摆满了各式冷盘：切片的五香火腿，四周堆满了五颜六色的色拉，还有烤得金黄的乳猪和火鸡。在大厅里面，设了一个用真正的铜杆搭成的酒吧，备有各种杜松子酒和烈酒，还有各种早已罕见的甘露酒；女宾客大多数是年轻人，根本辨不清这些酒类的名称。

乐队在七点以前已经到达，并不是什么简单的小乐队，而是一支拥有双簧管、长号、萨克斯管、大小提琴、短号、短笛、高低音鼓的大型乐队。最后一批游泳的客人已经从海滩上返回，正在楼上更衣。从纽约过来的汽车五辆一排，停在车道上。所有的大厅、客室和阳台都已经装饰得五彩缤纷。女来宾的发型各式各样，争奇斗妍，她们身上的披肩就连卡斯蒂尔17人做梦也想不到。酒吧那边热闹非凡，一巡又一巡的鸡尾酒让外面的花园弥漫着酒香，直到后来整个空气都欢腾起来，充满了欢声笑语，充满了脱口而出、转身便忘的打趣和寒暄，充满了素不相识的女人们之间热情无比的交谈。

大地踉踉跄跄离开了太阳的光芒，灯光愈发显得明亮。此时，乐队演奏起温馨的鸡尾酒乐曲。众位来宾的声音如同演唱歌剧一样也提高了一个音调。欢笑声越来越有感召力，慷慨地倾泻而出，一句玩笑话就会引起哄堂大笑。人群的聚散速度也越来越快了，时而随着新加入的客人而扩大，时而分散后又重新聚拢起来。一些人开始来回游荡，一些大胆的女孩子在比较固定的人群中穿行，一会儿在欢乐的短暂瞬间成为一群人的焦点，一会儿又洋洋得意地悄然离去，在不断变换的灯光下，在变幻不定的面孔、话语和色彩中穿梭往来。

突然，这些吉普赛人似的姑娘中浑身珠光宝气的一位，随手抓了一杯鸡尾酒一饮而尽，壮了壮胆子，像弗里斯克18般挥动着双手，一个人跳到篷布搭的舞池里手舞足蹈起来。沉静了片刻之后，乐队指挥殷勤地为她变换了曲子的节奏，接着爆发出一阵唧唧喳喳的说话声，因为有人误传她就是轻松歌舞剧中的吉尔达·格瑞19的替身。晚会正式开始了。

我第一次到盖茨比家的那天晚上，我相信我是少数几个得到正式邀请的客人之一。大多数人并没有受到邀请——他们是自己来的。他们坐上汽车，车子把他们送到长岛，也不知怎么的就来到了盖茨比的家门口。到了那儿，只要有个认识盖茨比的人介绍一下，他们就进去了，随后，他们的言谈举止就像在娱乐场所一样了。有时他们从来到走，压根就没有见过盖茨比，他们怀着一颗真心来参加聚会的，这份诚意便是他们的入场券了。

我确实是受到了邀请。那个星期六的清晨，一个身穿蓝色制服的司机穿过我家的草坪，为他的主人送来了一份措辞非常正式的请柬，上面写道：如蒙不弃，欢迎光临今晚举行的“小型聚会”，盖茨比将感到十分荣幸。上面还说，他见到我几次，欲登门拜访，却因种种原因，未能如愿，深表遗憾等等。最后签名是杰伊·盖茨比，笔迹庄重。

晚上7点刚过，我就穿上白色法兰绒衣服走过他家的草坪参加聚会。局促不安地在素不相识的人群中转来转去——尽管我偶尔也会碰到在上下班火车上见过的面孔。让我感到吃惊的是到会的有不少年轻的英国人，他们衣着考究，却面露饥色，热情地与成功富有的美国人低声交谈。我能确定他们是在推销什么东西：债券、保险或者汽车什么的。他们个个十分焦急，因为他们知道身边有钱可捞，机不可失。他们深信只要自己话说得讨巧，大把的钱便到手了。

我一到那里就想法去找主人，可是问了两三个人，他们都用极为诧异的目光瞪着我，并且异口同声说不知道主人的踪迹。于是，我只好悄悄溜向摆放鸡尾酒的桌子——整个花园里只有这儿，一个单身汉可以逗留一会而不会显得无所事事和形单影只。

我百无聊赖，正想喝个酩酊大醉，此时，乔丹·贝克从屋里走了出来，站在大理石台阶的最上一层，身体稍微后倾，神情傲慢地俯视着整个花园。

不管人家欢不欢迎，我觉得必须给自己找一个伴，不然我又要开始和过往的陌生人寒暄了。

“哈罗！”我大喊一声，朝她走去。我的声音出乎意料地响彻整个花园。

“我想你会来这里的，”等我走上前去，她心不在焉地答道，“我记得你说过你住在他家隔壁……”

她轻轻地和我握了握手，说过一会儿再来关照我，转身侧耳倾听两个穿着同样黄色连衣裙的姑娘说话，她们刚在台阶下面停步。

“哈罗！”她们异口同声喊道，“可惜你没有赢。”

她们说的是高尔夫球赛，她在上一星期的决赛中输掉了。

“你不认识我们，”其中一个身穿黄裙子的姑娘说道，“但是我们大约一个月前在这里见过你。”

“后来你们染了头发了。”乔丹说，我心中一愣，但是两个姑娘已经漫不经心地走过去了，她这句话仿佛是对早早升起的月亮说的。毋庸置疑，月亮同晚餐一样，也是承办宴会的人从篮子里拿出来的。挽着乔丹那纤细的金黄色的手臂，我们一起走下了台阶，在花园里漫步。一盘鸡尾酒在暮色中飘然而至，我们找了一张桌子坐了下来，同桌的还有三个男的和那两位身穿黄衣裙的姑娘，三人自我介绍时都含含糊糊的，听不清他们姓甚名谁。

“你们常来这里参加聚会吗？”乔丹问她旁边的那位姑娘。

“上次来这里就是见到你的那次，”姑娘机灵又自信地答道。随后，她又转向她的同伴问道：“露西尔，你是不是也是这样？”

露西尔也是如此。

“我喜欢来这里，”露西尔说，“我从来不在意在做什么，只要玩得尽兴就行。上次来这里的时候，我的裙子在椅子上挂破了，他问了我的名字和地址……不到一个星期，我收到了从克罗里公司寄来的包裹，里面是一件崭新的晚礼服。”

“你收下了吗？”乔丹问。

“当然收了。我本来打算今晚穿着它来的，但是胸口那地方太大，要修改一下。衣服是淡蓝色的，上面镶着浅紫色的珠子。要二百六十五美元呢。”

“会这么做事的人真是有点意思，”另外一个姑娘急切地说，“他不想得罪任何人。”

“谁不想？”我问。

“盖茨比。有人告诉我……”

两个姑娘和乔丹神秘地凑在一起。

“有人告诉我说他曾经杀过人。”

我们几个人都打了个冷战。那三位喊不上名字的男士也把身子往前凑，急着听个究竟。

“我想还不至于那样吧，”露西尔不以为然地辩解说，“多半是他在打仗时做过德国间谍。”

其中一位男士点头表示赞同。

“我也听人这样说过，那人是和他一起在德国长大的，对他非常了解。”他非常确定地对我们说。

“哦，不对，”第一个姑娘又说，“不可能是那样，因为大战时他正在美国军队服役。”看到我们又倾向于相信她的话了，她又兴致勃勃地凑过来。“在他以为没有人注意他的时候，你瞧他一眼。我敢打赌他杀过人。”

她眯起眼睛，哆嗦了起来。露西尔也战栗起来。我们都回过身来，四处张望寻找盖茨比。有人认为这个世界上没有什么不能公开谈论的事情，可是这些人却也在窃窃私语地谈论盖茨比，这就证明他可以引起人们多少浪漫的遐想了。

第一顿晚饭——午夜后还有一顿——此时开始了，乔丹邀请我与她的一伙朋友坐在一起，他们都围坐在花园另一侧的桌子上。共有三对夫妇，以及乔丹的一位护花使者——一个有些愤青的大学生，此人喜爱旁敲侧击、含沙射影，并且显然认为乔丹早晚都会或多或少委身于他。这一桌人席间毫不散漫，个个正襟危坐，俨然以举止庄重高贵的乡绅代表自居——东半岛屈尊光临西半岛，却又小心翼翼地提防着它灯红酒绿的欢愉。

“我们走吧，”白白地浪费了半个小时后，乔丹低声说，“这里太局促了，我不适应。”

我们站起身来，她向其他人解释说，我们要去找主人。她说我还没有见过主人，这使我感到不安。那位大学生点点头，显出一副玩世不恭又有些忧虑的神情。

我们先来到酒吧找找，那里挤满了人，可是盖茨比不在那里。她从台阶上往下看，找不到他，阳台上也不见他的身影。我们想试试运气，就推开了一扇很气派的门，走进一间高高的哥特式图书室，四周镶嵌着英国雕花橡木，看上去像从国外的某处遗址整体搬过来的。

一个略胖的中年男人，带着一副猫头鹰式的大眼镜，有点醉醺醺地坐在一个大桌子边上，眼睛游移不定地看着书架上的书。我们一进去，他就兴奋地转过身来，把乔丹从头到脚打量了一番。

“你觉得如何？”他唐突地问道。

“关于什么？”

他手一扬，指着那排书架问道。

“关于这些书。其实你们不必再费神去搞明白了，我已经验证过了，他们都是真的。”

“这些书吗？”

他点点头。

“绝对是真的——有版面有页码，什么都有。我原以为他们都只是漂亮的空壳子。事实上，他们全是真的书，一页又一页——让我拿一本给你们看。”

他想当然地以为我们怀疑他说的话，便急忙跑到书架前，拿回了一本《斯托达德演说集》20第一卷。

“看！”他得意洋洋地嚷道，“这是一本货真价实的印刷品。它把我蒙住了，这家伙简直是个贝拉斯科21。真是了不起。这么惟妙惟肖！这么完美！而且知道适可而止，恰到好处——并没有裁开书页。你还（二）什么？还指望什么？”

他从我手里把那本书一把抢过去，急急忙忙地把它放回书架的原处，嘴里还一面嘟囔着：即使动了一砖一瓦，整个图书室也有可能坍塌。

“谁带你们来的？”他问道，“还是你们自己来的？我是有人带过来的。大多数客人都是别人带进来的。”

乔丹机灵地愉快地看了看他，并没有作答。

“我是被一位叫罗斯福的太太带进来的，”他接着说，“克劳德·罗斯福太太。你们认识她吗？我昨天晚上不知在什么地方碰到她的。我已经醉了个把星期了，我想在图书室里坐会可能会让我清醒过来。”

“醒过来了吗？”

“醒了一点，我想。但我还不确定。我在这里刚待了一个小时。我跟你们说过这些书吗？他们都是真的。它们是……”

“你告诉过我们了。”

我们一本正经地和他握了握手，随即回到外边。

这时，人们开始在花园里铺开的篷布上跳舞了。上了年纪的男人搂着妙龄少女不停地旋转，姿态略显笨拙；舞技一流的男女成双成对地拥抱在一起，跳着流行的舞步，守在舞池的角落里扭来扭去。还有不少单身女郎，要么在跳单人舞，要么在帮乐队里的班卓琴手或者鼓手敲打一会儿，让他们喘口气。到了午夜时分，狂欢进入了高潮。一位著名的男高音用意大利语引吭高歌，一位声名狼藉的女低音则唱起了爵士歌曲；两个节目中间，有人在花园的各处表演起了自己的“拿手好戏”，一阵阵欢乐又空洞的笑声响彻仲夏夜的上空。一对双胞胎演员——原来就是那两个穿黄色衣服的姑娘——也粉墨登场表演了一出儿童剧。香槟酒不断地端了上来，用的杯子比餐桌上洗手指用的碗还要大。月亮爬得更高了，一个银色天平样的三角形星座悬浮在海湾的上空，随着草坪上班卓琴生硬而尖细的琴声而微微地颤动。

我仍旧和乔丹·贝克在一起。我们坐在一张桌子旁，同桌的还有一位年龄和我相仿的男士和一位爱吵闹的小姑娘，她动不动就放声大笑。我现在也自娱自乐起来。我已经喝了两大杯香槟。于是，眼前的景色变得意味深长、质朴自然而又深奥难测。

在娱乐节目中场休息的时候，同桌的那位男士看着我笑了。

“你看上去很面熟，”他彬彬有礼地说，“战争期间，你是在第一师吗？”

“正是啊。我当时在步兵二十八连。”

“我在十六连，直到1918年6月。我说好像在哪里见过你。”

我们聊了一会法国的一些潮湿、灰暗的小村庄。显然，他就住在附近，因为他告诉我他刚买了一架水上飞机，正准备明天早上去试飞一下。

“想和我一起去吗，老兄？就在海湾的岸边转转。”

“什么时候？”

“什么时候都行，只要你方便。”

我正要问他的名字，这时乔丹回过头来朝我笑了笑。

“现在玩得开心了吧？”她问道。

“好多了。”我又把头转向我的新朋友，“这个聚会对我来说非同寻常。我到现在还没有见到过主人。我就住在那边——”我指了指远处看不清的篱笆，“这位盖茨比先生派他的司机给我送来了一份请柬。”

他看着我好一会儿，似乎没有听懂我的话。

“我就是盖茨比。”他突然说。

“什么！”我叫了起来。“哦，真是对不起。”

“我以为你认识我，老兄。我恐怕不是一个好主人。”

他善解人意地笑了笑——还不仅仅是善解人意。这是一种极为罕见的微笑，带有一种让人无比放心的感觉，这种笑容也许你一辈子只能碰上四五次。这种微笑刹那间面对着——或者好像面对着整个永恒的世界，然后又带有一种对你的不可抗拒的偏爱，把全部的注意力都集聚在你身上。它所展现出的对你的理解的程度，就如同你希望被人理解的程度。对你的信任也达到了你相信自己的程度，并且让你相信他对你的印象不多不少正是你处在最佳状态时留给别人的印象。就在此刻，他的笑容消失了，我所看到的是一个风流倜傥的壮年男人，年纪约三十一二岁，说起话来措辞文雅，文绉绉得近乎滑稽可笑。在他做自我介绍之前，我强烈地感到他在小心谨慎地遣词造句。

正当盖茨比先生要介绍自己身份的那一刻，一个男管家急急忙忙地向他跑来，告诉他芝加哥有电话找他。他向在座的每一位来宾都微微地鞠躬表示歉意。

“你想要什么尽管开口，老兄，”他诚恳地说，“对不起，失陪一会儿。我马上过来。”

他刚一走开，我马上转向乔丹——急不可待地告诉她我的惊讶。我原以为盖茨比先生是个红光满面、肥头大耳的中年人。

“他是谁？”我急切地问，“你可知道？”

“他就是一个叫盖茨比的男人呗。”

“我是问他是哪里人？又是干什么的？”

“现在你也关心这个问题来了，”她懒洋洋地笑答道，“嗯，记得他有一次告诉我他上过牛津大学。”

有关他的背景隐隐约约地开始显露出来了，但是随着她说的下句话又渐渐消失了。

“不过，我并不相信。”

“为什么不信？”

“我不知道，”她执拗地说，“我就是不相信他上过牛津。”

她说话的语气让我想起了另外一个姑娘说过的话：“我认为他杀过人”，从而激起了我的好奇心。假如有人说盖茨比是从圣路易斯安那州的沼泽地走出来的，或者是从纽约东部的贫民窟里走出来的，我都会毫不怀疑地相信的。因为那是可以理解的。但是如此这般年轻的人不可能——至少依据我这个没见过世面的人看来，我不相信他会如此厉害，不知从什么地方钻出来，在长岛海湾买下一座宫殿式的豪宅。

“不管怎样，他经常举办大型聚会，”乔丹换了个话题，她也像一般城里人那样不屑于深究细节，“而我喜欢大型聚会，大家可以亲热地谈心。在小型的聚会上人们反而没有什么个人隐私。”

低音鼓轰隆隆地敲响起来，突然传来了乐队指挥的声音，盖过了花园里的嘈杂声。

“女士们，先生们，”他大声说，“应盖茨比先生的要求，我们为各位来宾演奏一曲弗拉迪米尔·托斯托夫先生的最新作品，这部作品5月份在卡耐基大厅演奏时引起了极大的关注。如果各位看过报纸，就知道当时曾经轰动一时。”他带着一副愉快而又居高临下的神情，又说，“真是轰动一时！”这句话引得众人哄堂大笑。

“这首知名的曲子的名字，”他用洪亮的声音结束讲话，“是弗拉迪米尔·托斯托夫的《爵士音乐世界史》。”

我没有认真听托斯托夫先生的这首曲子，因为演奏刚一开始，我的注意力就落到了盖茨比先生的身上，他独自一人站在大理石台阶的上面，用一种赞许的目光从这一群人看到那一群人。他那晒得黑黑的皮肤紧绷在脸上，极富魅力，头发留得短短的，看上去好像每天都修剪过。在他身上我实在看不到什么邪恶的迹象。我暗自揣测，是不是因为他不喝酒而使他和来宾们看上去截然不同？因为在我看来，随着来宾们越来越放纵开怀，他却变得越来越仪态庄重了。等到《爵士音乐世界史》演奏完毕，有的姑娘小狗似的乐呵呵地把头靠在男人的肩膀上，有的姑娘身子往后仰，晕倒在男人们的怀抱里，甚至倒在人堆里，因为她们明白一定会有人把她们托住。不过，没有姑娘倒在盖茨比身上，也没摩登女郎的法式短发轻拂盖茨比的肩头，更没有四重唱小组拉着盖茨比先生加入。

“对不起。”

盖茨比的男管家忽然站在我们身旁。

“是贝克小姐吗？”他问道，“请原谅，盖茨比先生想和你单独谈谈。”

“和我谈？”她吃惊地大声说。

“是的，小姐。”

她缓缓地站起身，惊讶地向我扬了扬眉毛，然后就跟着男管家向屋子走去。我注意到她穿的是晚礼服，但是她穿什么衣服都像穿运动装一样——她的动作轻快活泼，仿佛她当初就是在空气清新的早晨在高尔夫球场上学走路的。

我再次独自一人了。此时已经快凌晨两点了。有好一会儿，一阵乱哄哄的声音从阳台上一间长长的、装有许多窗户的房间里传出来，吸引了大家的注意力。陪伴乔丹前来的那位男大学生此刻正在与两位合唱团的女孩子大谈助产术，并且极力邀请我加入他们的谈话，可是我溜走了，走进了屋子。

大房间里挤满了人。一位穿黄衣服的姑娘正在弹钢琴，她身边站着一位身材颀长、红头发的年轻女士正在唱歌，她来自一个著名的合唱团。她喝了不少香槟，唱着唱着，她不合时宜地认定世上万物都很悲惨——于是她边唱边哭泣起来。每唱到曲子停顿的地方，她就抽抽搭搭地哭了起来，随后又用震颤的女高音继续唱下去。眼泪顺着她的脸颊往下流淌——但却并不顺畅，因为当泪水碰到她画得很浓的眼睫毛时，就变成了黑墨水，往下慢慢流淌时，就变成了一条条黑色的小溪。有人开玩笑地提议她唱一首她脸上画出的音符。听到这话她双手往上一甩，倒在一张椅子里，醉醺醺地呼呼大睡起来。

“她刚才和一个自称是她丈夫的男人打过一架。”我身边的一个姑娘解释道。

我向四周看了看。一多半留下来的女宾客都在和据说是他们丈夫的男人们吵架。甚至连乔丹那伙来自东半岛的四人组也因为意见不合，闹起了分裂。男士当中的一位正在兴致勃勃地和一位年轻的女演员交谈，他的妻子起初还保持着尊严，装作若无其事，企图对眼前的一切一笑了之，但是到后来她也实在忍受不住了，从侧面向他发起了攻击——时不时地出现在他的侧面，愤怒的面孔像钻石一样发亮，对着他的耳朵嘶喊：“你做过保证的！”

不愿意回家的不仅仅是那些任性的男人。此时大厅里面还有两位毫无醉意的男客和他们怒气冲天的太太。两位太太稍稍提高了嗓门相互安慰着。

“他只要一看见我玩得开心，就闹着要回家。”

“我这辈子从来没有见过像他这么自私的家伙。”

“我们总是最先离开。”

“我们也是一样。”

“哎，今天晚上我们几乎成了最后的了，”其中的一位男士怯生生地说，“乐队半个小时前就离开了。”

尽管两位太太一致认为这样的恶意拆台令人难以置信，这场争吵还是在一阵短暂的搏斗中结束了，两位先生各自抱起拳打脚踢的太太消失在夜色中。

我正站在大厅里等着侍者取回我的帽子，这时，图书馆的门开了，乔丹·贝克和盖茨比先生一起走了出来。他还在最后对她说着什么，不过这时有几个人上前与他告别，他那原本殷勤热切的表情突然消失了，变得一本正经起来。

乔丹那帮人不耐烦地在门廊里喊她，不过她还是停留了片刻，与我握手道别。

“我刚才听说了一件非常惊奇的事情，”她悄悄地对我说，“我们在里面待了多久？”

“哦，大约一个小时。”

“这事……太令人吃惊了，”她出神地重复说，“可是我已经发过誓不说出去，现在却来吊你的胃口了。”她当着我的面优雅地打了个哈欠，“有空请去找我……在电话簿的……西古奈·霍华德太太名下找……我的姨妈……”她边说边匆匆离开——她举起那晒得棕黑的手，轻快地挥手告别，然后融入在门口等她的那一伙人中去了。

我感到很不好意思，第一次来做客就待得这么晚，于是我走进围着盖茨比的最后一批客人当中。我想向他解释今晚我一来就在四处找他，并且为刚才在花园里竟然没有认出他来表示歉意。

“没关系，”他诚恳地说，“别放在心上，老兄。”这个亲昵的称呼，和他那安慰般地轻拍我的肩膀的手一样，使我感到格外亲切。“别忘了我们明天早上9点一起去乘水上飞机。”

这时，男管家来了，站在他身后说：“先生，费城来电话找你。”

“好的，等一下。告诉他们，我马上就来。晚安。”

“晚安。”

“晚安。”他微微一笑。突然之间，我发现待到最后再离开似乎有了某种令人愉快的感觉，好像这正是他一直希望的。

“晚安，老兄……晚安。”

但是，当我走下台阶时发现，晚会并没有完全结束。在离大门五十英尺的地方，十几盏汽车头灯照亮了一个奇怪混乱的场景。在路边的水沟里，一辆崭新的小轿车横躺在那里，右边朝上，一个轮子被撞掉了。这辆车离开盖茨比家的车道还不到两分钟。围墙上有一个突出的棱角造成了车轮的脱落。现在有五六位好奇的司机在那里围观。可是，因为他们的车子停在那里挡住了道路，后面的车子不停地按着喇叭；一阵阵刺耳的嘈杂声，使本来已经混乱不堪的场面变得更加糟糕。

一个穿长风衣的男人已经从那辆撞坏的车子上爬了出来，站在马路正中间，看看车看看轮胎，看看轮胎又看看围观的人，神情轻松又有些迷惑。

“瞧！”他解释说，“车子开到水沟里去了。”

这个事实让他感到十分吃惊，我开始只是感到这种吃惊非比寻常，后来认出了这个人——他就是之前光顾盖茨比先生图书室那个人。

“怎么回事？”

他耸耸肩。

“我对机械一窍不通。”他确定地说。

“但是这究竟是怎么发生的？你撞到墙上去了吗？”

“别问我，”“猫头鹰眼镜”说，他把这件事推得一干二净，“我对汽车驾驶知道得很少——几乎一无所知。事情就这么发生了，我所知道的就是这一点。”

“既然你不太会开车，就不应该试着在晚上开车嘛。”

“可是我连试也没试，”他愤愤不平地解释说，“我连试也没试啊。”

围观的人惊奇得说不出话来。

“你想自杀吗？”

“算你运气好，只是掉了一只轮子！不怎么会开车，竟然试都不试。”

“你们不了解，”这个闯祸的人解释说，“我根本就没有开车。车里面还有另外一个人。”

这话一出，便引起了人们连续不断的惊叹声：“啊-啊-啊！”这时小轿车的门慢慢地打开了。围观的人——此时已经聚集了一大群人了——不由自主地往后退了一步；当车门敞开时，顷刻之间是一片寂静。接着，非常缓慢地，一个脸色苍白、身子东摇西晃的人从那撞坏的车子里面爬了出来，下地时还先用他那只大舞鞋试了几下。

这位幽灵般的人被汽车前灯的亮光晃得睁不开眼，又被一片汽车喇叭声闹得糊里糊涂，站在那里摇晃了一会儿，才认出那个穿风衣的人。

“怎么回事？”他镇定地问道，“是不是我们没有汽油了？”

“瞧！”

六七个人用手指向那被撞下来的车轮。他盯着它看了一会儿，又抬头往上看，好像怀疑轮子是从天上掉下来的。

“轮子掉下来了。”有一个人解释说。

他点点头。

“开始我还没注意到车子停下来了。”

沉静了一会，他深深地吸了一口气，挺了挺胸膛，用一种不容置疑的语气说：“谁能告诉我这附近哪里有加油站？”

顿时，至少有十几个人——其中几个头脑比他稍微清醒一点——解释说轮子和车身已经完全分家了。

“倒车，”过了一会儿他提议说，“把车子正过来。”

“可是轮子已经掉了！”

他迟疑了一会儿。

“试试也无妨嘛。”他说。

汽车喇叭的尖声怪叫逐渐达到了高潮。于是我转过身去，穿过草坪，往家里走去。路上我回头望了一眼。一轮如薄饼一样的圆月正照在盖茨比的别墅上，夜色依旧美好，花园依旧灯光璀璨，而欢声笑语都已经逝去。一股突如其来的空虚似乎正从每一扇窗户、每一扇门里倾泻出来，使那主人的身影显得越发的形单影只；他这时正站在门廊上，举起手摆出与客人正式道别的姿势。

重读一下前面我所写的这些内容，我发觉我已经给人留下这样一种印象：好像间隔几个星期里断断续续发生在三个晚上的事情，已占据了我整个的身心。事实恰恰相反，它们只不过是一个繁忙的夏天里偶尔发生的一些事情，在之后很长的一段时间里，我对它们的关注程度还远远比不上我对自己的私事的关注。

大多数的时间我都在工作。清晨，每当太阳东升，我就急急忙忙地穿过纽约南部摩天大楼之间的白色空隙，赶往诚信信托公司上班，一路上太阳把我的影子映向西边。我与公司里其他的员工和年轻的债券推销员混得很熟，经常与他们一起在阴暗、拥挤的饭馆里共进午餐，吃些小猪肉香肠、土豆泥，喝杯咖啡。我甚至和一个在会计部工作的姑娘谈过一段短暂的恋爱，她住在纽约附近的泽西城，但是她的哥哥对我冷眼相向，所以在她7月份去度假的时候，我就悄悄地和她吹了。

我通常在耶鲁俱乐部吃晚饭——说不上什么缘故，这是我一天当中最不开心的时刻——饭后我就去楼上的图书室，专心学习一个小时的投资和证券方面的知识。附近总有几个喝醉酒吵闹的人，但他们从来不上图书室，因此这里是学习的好地方。从那里出来，如果天气宜人，我就沿着麦迪逊大街溜达，经过那家年代久远的默里山酒店，再穿过33号街，一直走到宾夕法尼亚车站。

我开始喜欢纽约了，喜欢它在夜晚给人的那种充满活力的奔放刺激的情调；红男绿女穿梭往来，车水马龙令人目不暇接，带来了视觉上的享受。我喜欢沿着第五大道漫步，从人群中找寻风情万种的女人，幻想着几分钟后我便进入她们的生活，既不为人所知也无人反对。有时候，在我的脑海中我跟着她们走到偏僻街角她们所住的公寓，她们在走进家门之前回眸一笑，便消失在温暖的夜色中。在这大都市的迷人的暮霭里，我有时感到一种挥之不去的孤独，同时也觉得其他人也有此同感——那些贫困的年轻职员。他们在橱窗前徘徊不前，等到了时间就一个人去小饭馆吃顿饭，打发掉夜晚和生活中最令人陶醉的时光。

又到了晚上8点，四十几号街那一带昏暗的街巷里挤满了开往剧院区的出租车，五辆一排，热闹非凡，此时我心中就感到一种莫名的惆怅。出租汽车在路口暂停的时候，你可以依稀看到车里面的人相互依偎着，说话声和听不见的笑话所引发的欢声笑语传了出来，点燃的香烟在车里吐出一个个浑浊的烟圈。我幻想着自己也和他们一样匆忙地赶去寻欢作乐，分享他们的亲密和兴奋，于是我暗自为他们祝福。

我有一阵子没有见过乔丹·贝克了，后来在仲夏时节又见到了她。起初我觉得能和她一起东奔西跑是一种荣幸，因为她是个高尔夫球冠军，所有人都知道她的大名。后来发现又多了一层含义。我并没有真正爱上她，但是我感到对她柔情犹存，极想了解她的一切。她对外界摆出的那张厌烦高傲的面孔背后隐藏着某种东西——大多数装腔作势的背后总是隐藏着某种东西，虽说当初并非如此——有一天我发现了那是什么。当时我们俩一起到沃维克22去参加一次别墅聚会。她把一辆借来的车子不拉上顶篷就停在雨里，之后撒个谎，推得一干二净。这让我顿时想起了那晚在黛西家里没有想起的关于她的事。在她参加的第一场大型高尔夫球联赛赛场上，发生了一场风波，差一点登了报纸。有人说在半决赛那一轮比赛时她挪动了一个处在不利位置的球。这件事几乎成了一桩丑闻——后来渐渐平息了。一个球童撤回了他的证词，而另外一位唯一的证人也改口说他可能当初搞错了。这件事和她的名字却一直深深地印在我的脑海里。

乔丹·贝克本能地回避聪明机警的男人，现在我明白了这是因为她认为同循规蹈矩的人打交道会比较安全。她的不诚实已经到无药可救的地步。她不能忍受自己处于劣势，鉴于她的这种心理，我想她非常年轻的时候就开始耍各种花招，以便保持她那对世人的冷漠傲慢的微笑，而又能满足她的健壮敏捷躯体的要求。

这对我无所谓，女人不诚实，无须苛责——我只是偶尔觉得遗憾，过后就忘了。也就是在那次的别墅聚会上，我和她有过一次关于开车的有趣的谈话。因为她的车子紧挨着几个工人身边开了过去，结果我们车子的挡泥板蹭掉了一位工人外衣上的纽扣。

“你车子开得太大意了，”我严肃地说，“你要是不开得小心点，就干脆别开车。”

“我开得很小心。”

“不对，你不小心。”

“哼，没什么，反正别人小心就是了。”她轻松地说道。

“这和你开车有什么关系？”

“他们会给我让道，”她坚持己见，“双方都不小心才会发生事故。”

“要是碰上一个与你一样不小心的人呢？”

“我希望永远不会碰到这样的人，”她回答说，“我讨厌粗心的人。这就是我喜欢你的原因。”

她那双灰色的、被太阳照得眯起来的眼睛直直地盯着前方，但是她已经故意地改变了我们之间的关系，于是一瞬间我以为自己爱上了她。可是，我是个思维迟钝的人，内心又有许多清规戒律像刹车一样压抑着自己的欲望。我明白首先我要让自己从老家的那场纠缠不清的关系中完完全全地解脱出来。之前，我坚持每个星期写一封信，信尾署上“爱你的，尼克”，而我脑子里想的却是那位打网球的姑娘，爱看她那打球时上嘴唇上渗出的像小胡子一样细细的汗珠。不过，在我们之间确实有一种含糊的默契，我要获得自由就必须先巧妙地解除那段纠葛。

每个人都以为他自己至少具备一种主要的美德，而我的美德便是：诚实。我是我所认识的为数不多的诚实人当中的一个。





第四章


星期天的早上，当教堂的钟声在海边的村庄上空响起时，社交圈里的男男女女们又来到了盖茨比先生的别墅，在草坪上纵情欢乐。

“他是一个贩卖私酒的，”年轻的女人们在他的鸡尾酒和鲜花丛中漫步时，闲聊说，“有一回他杀了一个人，因为那人知道他是兴登堡23的侄子，恶魔的表兄弟。递给我一朵玫瑰花，亲爱的，再往我那只水晶杯里斟上一点酒。”

有一次我在一份列车时刻表的空白处记下了那年夏天到盖茨比别墅来过的所有人的名字。现在这已经是一张很旧的时刻表了，折叠处快要断开了，表的上方写着：“本时刻表自1922年7月5日起生效。”不过，我还能依稀辨别出那些已经变得暗淡了的名字，与我对那些人的笼统概括相比，它们能给读者一个更加清楚的印象，那些人都到盖茨比的家里做过客，却对他一无所知，好像这就是他们对盖茨比所表示的一种微妙的敬意。

从东半岛来的有切斯特·贝克夫妇、利奇夫妇、一个我在耶鲁就认识的叫本森的男子，还有韦伯斯特·西维特大夫，去年夏天他在缅因州溺水死了。还有霍恩比姆夫妇、威利·伏尔泰夫妇以及布莱克巴克的全家，他们总是聚集在一个角落里，不管谁走近，他们都会像山羊一样翘起鼻子。此外，还有伊斯梅夫妇、克里斯蒂夫妇（更确切地说是休伯特·奥尔巴哈和克里斯蒂先生的太太）和埃德加·比弗，据说比弗的头发在一个冬天的下午无缘无故地一下子变得像棉花一样白。

我记得克拉伦斯·恩迪弗也来自东半岛。他只来过一次，穿着一条白色的灯笼裤，还在花园里跟一个叫埃蒂的流浪汉干了一架。从小岛更远的地方来的有奇德勒夫妇、O.R.P.斯雷德夫妇、佐治亚州的斯通瓦尔·杰克逊·亚伯拉姆夫妇，还有菲希加德夫妇和里普利·斯奈尔夫妇。斯奈尔在他去坐牢的前三天来过这里，喝得酩酊大醉，倒在石子车道上，结果尤里内斯·斯威特太太的汽车从他的右手上辗了过去。丹希尔夫妇也来过，还有年近七十的S.B.怀特贝特，以及莫里斯·A.弗林克、汉姆海德夫妇、烟草进口商贝路加和他的几个姑娘。

来自西半岛的有波尔夫妇、穆尔莱迪夫妇、塞西尔·罗伯克、塞西尔·肖用、州参议员古利克，以及控制卓越电影公司的老板牛顿·奥基德、艾克霍斯特和克莱德·科恩、小唐·S.施沃兹以及阿瑟·麦卡蒂，这些人都跟电影界有着这样那样的关系。还有卡特利普夫妇、贝姆勃格夫妇和G.厄尔·马尔东，他就是后来把自己妻子勒死的那个姓马尔东的人的兄弟。赞助商达·冯坦诺也来过，还有爱德·莱格罗、詹姆斯·B.菲来特（诨名是“劣酒”）、德·琼大妇和欧内斯特·利里——他们都是来赌钱的。每当费莱特逛进花园，那就意味着他输得精光，于是第二天他就会为了赚取利润让联合运输公司的股票或升或降。

有一个叫克利普斯普林格的人经常去那里，而且一待就待上很长时间，所以人们都叫他“寄宿生”——我怀疑他根本就没有家。在戏剧界人士中，有葛斯·威兹、霍勒斯·奥多诺万、莱斯特·迈尔、乔治·德克维德和弗朗西斯·布尔。从纽约城里来的还有克罗姆夫妇、贝克海森夫妇、丹尼克夫妇、罗素·贝蒂、科里根夫妇、凯利赫夫妇、杜厄夫妇、斯科里夫妇、S.W.贝尔奇夫妇、斯默克夫妇和现在已经离了婚的年轻的奎因夫妇，以及亨利·L.帕默多，他后来在时代广场的地铁站卧轨自杀了。

本尼·麦克莱纳亨总是带着姑娘一起来，跟他来的过的共有四个姑娘。每次来的都不是同一个姑娘，不过她们看上去都长得非常相像，所以看起来好像以前来过的。我忘了她们的名字——我想是叫杰奎林吧，要不然就是康雪爱拉，或者葛洛莉亚，或者朱迪，或是琼，她们的姓要么是美妙悦耳的花名或者月份的名字，要么就是令人肃然起敬的美国大资本家的姓氏，要是被人追问，她们就会承认自己只是他们的远亲而已。

除了上面这些人之外，我还记得福斯蒂娜·奥布莱恩至少来过一次，还有贝德克姐妹和年轻的布鲁尔，他的鼻子在战争中被打掉了。还有阿尔布鲁克斯伯格先生和他的未婚妻海格小姐、阿迪泰·费兹彼德夫妇和曾经担任过美国退伍军人协会会长的P·朱厄特先生，还有克劳迪娅·希普小姐和一个传闻是她司机的男伴，还有一位亲王什么的，我们都叫他公爵，至于他的名字，即便我曾经知道过，现在也忘了。

所有这些人那年夏天都来过盖茨比的别墅。

7月底的一天早上9点，盖茨比的豪华汽车沿着石子铺砌的车道一路颠到我家门口，三个音符的喇叭发出一阵悦耳的声响。这是他第一次来看我，虽然我已经参加两次他的聚会，也乘过他的水上飞机，并且在他的热情邀请之下经常光顾他的私人海滩。

“早啊，老兄。你今天要和我共进午餐，我想我们就一起坐车进城吧。”

他站在汽车的踏脚板上，身体保持平衡，动作灵活敏捷，表现出美国人的特色——我想这是由于年轻的时候不干重体力活，或者更可能是因为我们那些紧张激烈的运动项目练就了我们自然优雅的动作。这个特点不时地以好动不安的形式展现出来，打破了他拘谨的举止。他片刻也不能安静，不是一只脚在轻轻地拍打什么地方，就是一只手不耐烦的一张一合。

他注意到我正羡慕地盯着他的车子，便跳下车来，好让我看个清楚。

“这车很漂亮，是吗，老兄？”他说道，“以前你见过这车吗？”

我见过。每个人都看到过。车子是浓浓的乳白色，镀镍的部位闪闪发亮，长长的车身上这里那里的鼓突部分，是内设的放置帽子、食品和工具的暗箱，匠心独运。成阶梯状的挡风玻璃，折射出十几个太阳，扑朔迷离。我们坐进了好几层玻璃后面的如同温室一样的、用绿色皮革装饰的车厢里，动身向城里开去。

在过去一个月里，我大约跟他聊过五六次。但让我感到很失望，他没有多少话。所以我最初以为他是一位了不起的大人物的印象，逐渐的淡薄了，他充其量不过是隔壁的一家豪华旅馆的老板而已。

接着就发生了那次令人窘迫的同车之行。我们还没有到达西半岛，盖茨比就开始停下尚未结束的文绉绉的谈话，同时迟疑不决地用手拍打着他淡褐色西装裤的膝盖处。

“我说，老兄，”他冷不丁地冒出一出，让人一惊。“你究竟对我是怎么个看法？”

我一下子蒙了，只好说一些含糊其辞的话语来搪塞一下。

“好吧，我给你讲讲我的经历吧，”他打断了我的话。“我不希望你因听信那些谗言而对我产生错误的看法。”

原来他知道那些在他的客厅里流传的稀奇古怪的流言蜚语。

“上帝作证，我要告诉你全部的真相。”他突然举起了右手，好像若有半句假话，随时准备接受上帝的惩罚。“我出生在中西部的一个富有的家庭里——家里人全部过世了。我在美国长大的，却是在牛津接受的教育，因为我的祖辈都是在那里接受了多年的教育。这是我们家族的传统。”

他斜着眼看了看我——这下我才明白为什么乔丹·贝克曾认为他撒谎了。他把“在牛津受的教育”这句话一带而过，或者含糊其辞，或者吞吞吐吐，仿佛这句话以前曾使他犯过嘀咕。有了这个疑点，他所说的一切就都站不住脚了，于是我开始猜测他身上的确有什么不可告人之处。

“中西部什么地方？”我随便问了一句。

“旧金山。”

“哦，我清楚了。”

“我家里人全去世了，我继承了一大笔遗产。”

他的语气很严肃，似乎突然失去家人的痛苦回忆仍旧缠绕着他，有一会儿我怀疑他在愚弄我，但是瞥了他一眼后，我又都信以为真了。

“后来，我像一位年轻的东方王子一样游遍了欧洲各大首都——巴黎、威尼斯、罗马——收藏以红宝石为主的珠宝，打打猎，学学画，纯粹是为了自我消遣，好让自己忘却以前发生的那些伤心事。”

我好不容易才忍住不笑出声来，因为他讲的话实在令人难以置信，都是些陈词滥调，在我的脑海里只留下这样一个形象：在傀儡戏里，一个头上裹着头巾的“角色”在布罗涅森林24里追赶老虎，边跑身子里填的木屑边往外漏。

“后来就打仗了，老兄。这倒是一个解脱的好机会。我千方百计地想一死了之，可是我这条命好像有神仙保佑一样。战争开始的时候，我被任命为中尉。在阿尔贡森林25一役中，我带领两个机枪分队勇往直前，结果长达半英里的两翼全无掩护，因为步兵在那里无法向前推进。我们在那里坚守了两天两夜，130名士兵只有16挺刘易斯轻型机关枪。等到步兵团冲上来时，他们在堆积如山的尸体中发现了三个德国师的徽章。我被提拔为少校，每一个同盟国政府都授予我一枚勋章——黑山国26也不例外，就是亚德里亚海边的那个小小的黑山国！”

小小的黑山国！他说这几个字的时候提高了嗓门，并不住地点头——还带着他特有的微笑。这微笑表示他了解黑山国动乱的历史，并且同情黑山国人民进行的英勇斗争。这微笑也表示他完全领会黑山民族的情结链，正因为此，黑山国那小小的温暖的心田里发出了对他的赞美。我的怀疑此时已经淹没在惊诧之中，好似快速地翻阅十几本杂志一样。

他把手伸进口袋，掏出一枚系着丝带的金属徽章，放在我的掌心。

“这就是黑山国授予我的那枚奖章。”

让我吃惊的是，那块东西看上去像是真的。“丹尼罗勋章”，上面刻着一圈铭文：黑山国国王尼古拉斯·莱克斯。

“翻过来看看。”

“杰伊·盖茨比少校，”我念道，“英勇卓绝。”

“这是另外一件我总是随身携带的物件。牛津大学时代的一件纪念品。它是在三一学院校园里照的——我左边的那个人现在是唐卡斯特伯爵。”

照片上共有六位青年，身上穿着运动衣，在一道拱门里悠闲地站着，透过拱门可以看到许多塔尖27。照片中的盖茨比看上去比现在略显年轻，不过也年轻不了多少——手里拿着一根板球棒。

这样看来他说的都是真的啦。我仿佛看见一张张的虎皮挂在他在威尼斯大运河上的宫殿里，耀眼夺目。我又仿佛看见他正在打开一箱红宝石，借它们那耀眼的红色光芒来抚慰他那颗破碎的心灵的痛苦。

“今天我要请你帮个大忙，”他边说边满意地把他的纪念品放回口袋里。“所以我想你应该对我有所了解。我不希望你认为我是个来路不明的泛泛之辈。你清楚，我天天和陌生人来往，因为我总是四处流浪，努力忘却那些伤心事。”他犹豫了片刻又说，“你今天下午会知道这件事的。”

“是吃午饭的时候吗？”

“不，今天下午。我碰巧得知你约了贝克小姐去喝茶。”

“你是说你爱上了贝克小姐吗？”

“不，老兄，我没有。可是贝克小姐已经同意由她来跟你谈这件事。”

我对“这件事”指的是什么，毫不知晓，但是我没多大兴趣，倒觉得有些反感。我请贝克小姐喝茶，并不是为了谈论杰伊·盖茨比先生。我敢肯定他请求我做的事情一定十分稀奇古怪，有那么一会工夫，我真后悔曾经踏上他家那方宾朋如云的草坪了。

他不再多说什么。我们离城区越近，他显得越矜持。我们经过罗斯福港，从那里可以瞥见一艘船身漆着一圈红道的远洋货轮，随后又驶过一个贫民窟，石子路的两旁排列着19世纪初镀金现已退色的酒吧，虽然阴暗却仍有客人光顾。接着，那个灰谷在我们的两侧延伸，我从车上瞥见威尔逊太太正在加油泵前卖力地替人加油，一面喘着粗气。

汽车的挡泥板像翅膀一样张开，我们飞驰起来，一路给半个纽约皇后区的阿斯托里亚街区带来了光明——仅仅只是半个区，因为当我们在高架铁路的支柱间绕来绕去的时候，我听到了熟悉的摩托车发出的“哒——哒——噼啪”声，随即看到一个气急败坏的警察追了上来，在我们车旁驶过。

“好了，老兄。”盖茨比喊道，我们放慢了速度。他从皮夹里掏出一张白色的卡片，在警察的眼前晃了一下。

“行了，”警察轻轻地碰一碰帽檐，满口应承道，“下次就认识您啦，盖茨比先生。请原谅我！”

“那是什么？”我问，“是那张牛津的相片吗？”

“我曾经帮过警察局局长一个忙，因此每年他都给我寄一张圣诞贺卡。”

在大桥上，阳光透过桥上的钢架照射在川流不息的汽车身上熠熠生辉，河对岸崛起的城市里一栋栋高楼拔地而起，像一堆堆白色的糖块一样，但愿它们都是用没有铜臭味的钱建造起来的。从皇后区大桥28远眺纽约市，看到的永远是这座城市的第一印象，它要率先向人们展示世界上所有的神秘和瑰丽。

一辆装着灵柩的车子从我们身旁经过，车上堆满了鲜花，后面跟着两辆窗帘拉得紧紧的马车，还有几辆轻快的马车载着一帮亲朋好友，这些送殡的亲友们透过车窗看着我们，从他们那忧郁的眼神和薄薄的上唇可以看出，他们是东南欧人。我很高兴在他们肃穆的送殡队伍里还能看到盖茨比的豪华轿车。我们穿过布莱克威尔岛29的时候，一辆高级轿车超越了我们，司机是个白人，里面坐着三个打扮入时的黑人，两男一女。看到他们朝我们翻着白眼，一副不甘示弱的傲慢神气，我忍不住哈哈大笑起来。

“过了这座桥，什么事情都可能发生，”我心里想，“无论什么事情都……”

因此，冒出这么个盖茨比出来，完全不用大惊小怪。

烈日炎炎的中午，在42号街一家电扇开得很猛的地下餐厅里，我跟盖茨比相约共进午餐。从阳光强烈的街上走进来，我先眨眨眼睛适应一下，然后模模糊糊地看见他在接待厅里，正在跟另外一个人说话。

“卡洛维先生，这是我的朋友沃尔夫山姆先生。”

一个身材矮小、鼻子扁平的犹太人抬起他的大脑袋打量了我一番，他的两鼻孔里长满了浓密的鼻毛。过了一会儿，我才在半明半暗的光线中发现了他的两只小眼睛。

“……于是我就瞥了他一眼，”沃尔夫山姆先生一面说，一面很热切地跟我握手，“你猜我做了什么事？”

“什么事？”我很有礼貌地问。

显然，他这话不是对我说的，因为他随即放下了我的手，把他那富有表现力的鼻子对准了盖茨比。

“我把那笔钱交给凯兹保，同时我对他说：‘好吧，凯兹保，你要是不闭嘴，一分钱也不给你。’他马上就闭嘴了。”

盖茨比先生一手挽着他，一手挽着我，一起走进了餐厅，沃尔夫山姆先生只好把他刚到嘴边的话咽了回去，随后便变得如同梦游一样心不在焉。

“要姜汁威士忌吗？”领班的侍者问道。

“这家馆子不错，”沃尔夫山姆先生说，眼睛望着天花板上画的长老会仙女说，“但是我更喜欢街对面那家。”

“好的，来点姜汁威士忌，”盖茨比应道，然后转向沃尔夫山姆先生说，“那边太热了。”

“又热又挤——不错，”沃尔夫山姆先生说，“可是那儿却充满了回忆。”

“是哪一家馆子？”我问。

“老大都会。”

“老大都会，”沃尔夫山姆先生若有所思地说道，“那里相聚过消逝的面容，那里相聚过永远逝去的朋友。我一辈子也忘不了他们开枪打死罗西·罗森塞尔的那个晚上。我们一共六人围坐在桌子旁边，罗西那天晚上开怀畅饮。天快亮时，侍者神情诡异地走到他跟前，说外面有人找他。‘知道了，’他说完就站起身来。我把他拉回到了椅子上。”

“‘罗西，那帮杂种要找你，就让他们上这儿来，但是罗西，你千万不要走出这间屋子。’”

“那时候已经凌晨四点，如果我们拉起窗帘，就能看到天已经亮了。”

“他去了吗？”我天真地问。

“那还用说。”沃尔夫山姆先生的鼻子气呼呼地向我晃了晃。“他走到门口还回过头来说：‘别让侍者把我的咖啡收走！’说完他就走到外面人行道上，他们朝他吃得鼓鼓的肚皮放了三枪，然后开车跑掉了。”

“他们中的四人后来被处以电刑。”我记起来了。

“五个人，连贝克在内。”他鼻孔转向我，一副颇感兴趣的样子，“我听说你正在找关系30做生意。”

他把这两句话放在一起，让人听了震惊，盖茨比替我回答：“噢，不是，”他解释道，“不是他。”

“不是他？”沃尔夫山姆先生似乎有些失望。

“他只是一位朋友。我对你说过我们改天再谈那件事嘛。”

“对不起，”沃尔夫山姆先生说，“我搞错人了。”

这时，一盘鲜嫩的烤肉丁端了上来，沃尔夫山姆先生忘掉了老大都会令人伤心的往事，开始津津有味地大吃起来。同时，他的眼睛很慢地转动着，把眼前的餐厅扫视了一圈——最后他又转过身来察看坐在他背后的人，从而完成了一个弧圈。我想如果不是我在场，他甚至会连我们桌子底下也要瞄上一眼。

“唉，老兄，”盖茨比把身子靠近我说，“今天早上在车子里我恐怕惹你生气了吧？”

他脸上又堆起了那种熟悉的笑容，可是这次我无动于衷。

“我不喜欢神神秘秘的，”我答道，“我也不明白你为什么不肯开诚布公地告诉我你想要什么。为什么这件事非要通过贝克小姐？”

“噢，决不是什么见不得人的事情，”他向我保证，“你也知道，贝克小姐是一位出名的运动健将，她决不会做任何不正当的事。”

突然，他看了看手表，蹦了起来，急急忙忙地离开餐厅，把我和沃尔夫山姆先生留在餐桌旁。

“他得去打电话，”沃尔夫山姆先生目送他离去说，“他人不错，是吧？仪表堂堂，是个十足的绅士。”

“是的。”

“他是纽津人。”31

“噢。”

“他上过英国纽津大学。你知道纽津大学吗？”

“我听说过。”

“它是世界上最著名的大学之一。”

“你认识盖茨比很久了吗？”我问道。

“好几年了，”他神情得意地回答。“战争刚结束我便有幸认识他了。我刚和他谈了一个小时就明白我碰到了一个很有教养的人。我对自己说，‘这个人是你乐意带回家介绍给你母亲和妹妹认识的人。’”他停顿了一下说，“我发现你在看我的袖口。”

我本来并没有看他的袖口，但是这会我看到了。它们是由小象牙片制成的，看起来挺亲切。

“这是用精选的人的臼齿做的。”他告诉我。

“真的！”我仔细看了看，“这主意真是太妙了。”

“是的。”他把衬衣袖口缩回外套里面，“是啊，盖茨比对女人十分谨慎。他从不对朋友的妻子多看一眼。”

这时，那位凭直觉受到信任的对象又回到了我们的餐桌前坐了下来，沃尔夫山姆先生一口喝完了咖啡，然后站起身来。

“午餐吃得很高兴，”他说道，“我要赶快离开这儿，再待下去就让你们两个年轻人觉得讨厌了。”

“迈尔，别急，”盖茨比无精打采地说。沃尔夫山姆先生举起手，做了一个祝福的姿势。

“你们很有修养，不过我是属于另一辈的人了，”他一本正经地说，“你们在这里多坐会，聊聊你们喜欢的运动，你们的女友，还有你们的……”说话时他的手又挥动了一下，让你自己用想象力往下补充吧。“至于我，我已经五十岁了，就不再妨碍你们了。”

他跟我们握了握手，转过身去，他那伤感的鼻子又抖动起来。我不知道自己是否说了什么话冒犯了他。

“他有时会变得非常多愁善感，”盖茨比解释说，“今天又是他伤心日子的一天，他在纽约也是一个人物——百老汇的常客。”

“他究竟是什么人，演员吗？”

“不是。”

“牙科医生？”

“迈尔·沃尔夫山姆？不是，他是个赌徒。”盖茨比迟疑了一下，然后若无其事地又说了一句，“他就是1919年幕后操纵美国世界棒球总冠军决赛的那个人。”

“幕后操纵世界棒球总冠军决赛？”我重复了一遍。

这件事让我大吃一惊。我当然记得1919年世界棒球总冠军决赛被人操纵这事，但是即使我想起这件事，我也只会把它看成一件往事，是一连串不可避免的事件的结果。我从来没想到一个人可以把五千万人玩弄了——像撬保险柜的盗贼，一个人单枪匹马地搞定了。

“那他是怎么搞成的呢？”我过了一会儿才问道。

“他只不过是瞄准了机会。”

“他为啥没有被抓起来呢？”

“他们逮不住他，老兄，他可是个绝顶聪明的人。”

我抢着去买了单。服务员在给我找钱时，我正好看到了汤姆·布坎南在拥挤的餐厅的那一边。

“跟我来一下，”我说，“我要去同一个人打声招呼。”

汤姆一看见我们就跳了起来，三步并两步朝我们走来。

“你最近去哪儿了？”汤姆急切地问，“你不打电话来，黛西气死了。”

“布坎南先生，这位是盖茨比先生。”

他们敷衍地握了握手，盖茨比的脸上流露出局促不安的神情。

“你最近到底怎么样？”汤姆追问我，“你怎么会跑这么远到这里来吃饭？”

“我是和盖茨比先生一起来吃午饭的。”

我转身去看盖茨比先生，但他已经不知去向了。

1917年10月的一天。（那天下午，乔丹·贝克笔直地坐在广场饭店茶室里一张靠背笔直的椅子上向我说起了往事。）——那天我正从一个地方往另一个地方去，一会儿走在人行道上，一会儿走在草坪上。我更喜欢走在草坪上，因为那天我穿了一双英国鞋，鞋底有橡胶颗粒，在柔软的草地上留下了一个个印痕。我还穿了一条新的方格呢裙子，每当裙子随风飘起来，家家户户门前的红、白、蓝色的彩旗就都舒展开来，发出“啧—啧—”的响声，好像有点看不习惯似的。

旗子最大的、草坪也最大的就是黛西·费伊家。那时她刚刚十八岁，比我大两岁，是路易斯维尔这个地方的年轻小姐中风头最足的一个。她穿着白色的裙子，开一辆白色的微型跑车。她家里的电话一天到晚的响个不停，泰勒营里那些兴奋的青年军官们总是希望哪天晚上能单独和她约会。“无论如何给一个小时吧！”

那天上午我经过她家房子的对面时，她的白色跑车就停在路边，她跟一位我以前从未见过的陆军中尉坐在车里。他们俩全神贯注地望着对方，直到我走到离他们只有五英尺时，他们才发现我。

“你好，乔丹，”她出其不意地大声向我打招呼，“请过来一下。”

她要同我说话，我觉得有点受宠若惊，因为在所有年纪比我大的女孩子当中，我最爱慕的就是她。她问我是否正要到红十字会去做绷带，我说是的。接着，她问我能否替她捎口信，就说那天她不能去了。那位军官在黛西说话的时候盯着她看，每一位年轻的女孩子都曾经希望别人会用这种眼神来看自己。因为我觉得那非常浪漫，所以直到今天，我还记忆犹新。那位军官的名字叫杰伊·盖茨比，从那以后四年多，我一直没再见过他，甚至上次我在长岛上碰到他时，都没有认出他们就是同一个人。

那是1917年。到了第二年，我自己也有了几个追求我的男朋友，而且我也开始参加联赛了，所以我就不经常见到黛西。她总是与比她年纪稍大一些的朋友来往——如果她还跟谁来往的话。关于她的流言蜚语满天飞——说什么她母亲如何在一个冬天的夜晚发现她在收拾行装，准备到纽约去跟那位要远赴海外的军官告别。她被家里人拦了下来，可是事后她有好几个星期不跟家里人说话。从那以后她就不再跟军人交往了，只跟城里几个根本不能参军的平脚板、近视眼的年轻人来往。

第二年秋天，她情绪好转，和以前一样活跃。停战以后，举办了她首次进入社交生活的舞会。大约在2月份，她就和一个新奥尔良来的人订了婚。6月里她就跟芝加哥的汤姆·布坎南结了婚，婚礼之隆重豪华是路易斯维尔前所未有的。新郎带着一百多号人包了四节车厢前来，又租下了莫尔巴赫饭店整个一层楼。在婚礼的前一天，他送给她一串价值高达35万美元的珍珠项链。

我是黛西的伴娘之一。在婚宴开始前半小时我走进她的房间，发现她躺在床上，穿着一件绣花的衣服，样子像6月的夜晚一样可爱，喝得像猴子一样烂醉如泥。她一只手拿着一瓶白葡萄酒，另一只手捏着一封信。

“恭……喜我，”她咕哝着，“从来没喝过酒，哦，今天喝得可真痛快。”

“黛西，怎么回事？”

我吓坏了。说真的，我从来没见过一个女孩子醉成这副模样。

“给你，亲爱的，”她在拿到床上的废纸篓里乱摸了一会，掏出了那串珍珠。“把它拿下楼去，是谁的东西就还给谁。告诉他们黛西改变主意了。就说‘黛西改变主意了！’”

她开始哭泣起来，而且哭个不停。我冲出去找到她母亲的贴身佣人，我们两个一起锁上门，给她洗了个冷水澡。她紧紧地攥着那封信不放，并把它带到了浴缸里，捏成了一个湿漉漉的纸团，直到她看见那封信碎成雪花一样的纸屑，才让我拿过去放在肥皂碟里。

但是她再也不说一句话。我们让她闻了闻阿摩尼亚精油，把冰块敷在她的额头上，然后又哄着她穿好衣服。半小时后，我们走出房间时，那串珍珠项链已经戴在她的脖子上，这场风波就算过去了。次日下午5点钟，她没事儿似的跟汤姆·布坎南结了婚，然后开始了长达三个月的南太平洋蜜月旅行。

他们回来以后，我在加州圣巴巴拉32见到了他们，我觉得我从来没见过一个女人对她的丈夫如此迷恋。如果他离开房间一会儿，她就会心神不宁地四下张望，问：“汤姆上哪儿去啦？”一副失魂落魄的样子，直到看见他出现在门口。她常常坐在沙滩上，一坐就是个把小时，把他的头放在自己的膝盖上，用手指轻轻地摩挲着他的眼睛，满心欢喜地盯着他看。看到他们俩在一起的情景真叫人感动——会让你黯然向往，轻轻地会心一笑。那是8月里发生的事。我离开圣巴巴拉一个星期后，一天夜晚汤姆在凡图拉公路上与一辆货车相撞，他的车被撞掉了一只前轮。与他同车的姑娘也上了报纸，因为她的一只胳膊被撞断了——她是圣巴巴拉饭店里的一个打扫房间的女服务员。

第二年4月，黛西生了个女儿，随后他们一家到法国待了一年。有一年春天我在戛纳33见到了他们，后来又在多维尔34见过，再后来他们就回到芝加哥安顿下来。黛西在芝加哥很是风光，这你清楚。他们和一帮酒肉之徒往来，这些人个个都是风华正茂，富有而又放荡，但是她的名声却始终是清清白白。也许是因为她不喝酒的缘故。在爱喝酒的人中间能做到滴酒不沾，确实占了很大的便宜。你可以保持沉默，也可以趁其他人喝得烂醉的时候，稍稍有点小动作也无所谓，因为那时他们要么视而不见，要么满不在乎。也许黛西压根就没有搞过什么风流韵事，但是她的声音里却透着点异样的味道……

后来，大约六个星期以前，她多年来第一次听到了盖茨比的名字。就是那次我问你——你还记得吗？——你是否认识西半岛的盖茨比。你回家之后，她到我的房间里把我推醒，问我：“哪个盖茨比？”我半睡半醒，把他描述了一番。她听了之后，阴阳怪调地说，一定是她过去认识的那个人。直到那时，我才把这个盖茨比跟当年坐在她白色跑车里的那个军官联系起来。

等到乔丹·贝克把上面这段故事都讲完，我们离开广场饭店已经有半个小时，两人乘着一辆四轮敞篷马车穿过中央公园。太阳已经落在西城五十几号街那些电影明星们居住的公寓大楼后面。儿童们像草地上的蟋蟀一样聚集在一起，他们清脆的嗓音在闷热的暮色中响起：

我是阿拉伯的酋长，

你的爱情在我心上。

深夜当你酣然入睡，

我悄悄爬进你的帐篷——

“这真是奇怪的巧合。”我说道。

“但这根本不是什么巧合。”

“为什么不是？”

“盖茨比买下那幢房子，就是因为黛西住在海湾的对面嘛。”

这么说来，那个6月的夜晚，他举头仰望的不仅仅是天上的星星了。盖茨比在我眼中突然有了生命，好像一下子从那毫无意义的奢侈生活里脱胎出来，活生生地浮现在我的面前。

“他想知道，”乔丹继续说，“你是否愿意哪天下午请黛西到你府上，然后让他也过来坐一坐。”

这个要求如此微不足道，使我大吃一惊。他已经苦等了五年，又买了一幢豪宅，在那里把灿烂的星光给予那些来来往往的不速之客——目的就是为了自己能够在某天下午到一个陌生人的花园里“坐上一坐。”

“他托我办这点小事情，有必要告诉我所有的这一切吗？”

“他有点害怕，他已经等得太久了。他以为你也许会不高兴。你知道的，他其实是十分倔强的。”

我还是有些困惑。

“他为什么不请你安排一次见面呢？”

“他要让她看看他的房子，”她解释说，“你的房子正好就在他的隔壁。”

“噢！”

“我猜测他原本期望她在哪天晚上会不期而至，光临他的晚会，”乔丹接着说，“可她却始终没有来过。后来他就开始有意无意地向人家打听是否有人认识她，而我是他找到的第一个人。就是在舞会上他派人去请我的那天晚上，可惜你没听到他是如何费劲心思才转入正题的，我马上建议在纽约一起吃顿午饭——不曾想他急得像要发疯似的：‘我不想把事情做得过分！’他继续说道，‘我在隔壁见见她就行了。’”

“后来我说你是汤姆的一个非常要好4.朋友，他又放弃原来的打算。他对汤姆的情况不怎么了解，尽管他说多年来他一直在看一份芝加哥报纸，希望能碰巧看见黛西的名字。”

这时天已经黑了，我们的马车走到一座小桥下面，我伸出手臂揽住乔丹晒成金黄色的肩膀，把她拉到我身边，请她一起吃晚饭。刹那间，我不再想黛西和盖茨比，而是这个干净、健壮、不甚聪明的女人，她对一切都持怀疑的态度，而她此刻却快活地偎依在我的臂弯里。此时，我的耳畔响起了一句充满激情的名言警句：“世间芸芸众生，要么被别人追求，要么追求别人，要么忙忙碌碌，要么劳累不堪。”

“黛西在她生命中应该有点安慰。”乔丹轻声说道。

“她想见盖茨比吗？”

“她不知道这件事。盖茨比不想让她知道。你只要邀请她来喝茶就可以了。”

我们经过一排黑黢黢的树林，然后是第59号街的正面，微弱柔和的灯光照进了下面的公园。与盖茨比和汤姆·布坎南不同，我没有什么情人，自然不会有哪位姑娘的面庞隐约浮现在那些漆黑的飞檐或者耀眼的广告牌上。于是我把身边的姑娘拉得更近一点，胳膊搂得更紧一些。她嘴角边露出一丝有气无力而又蔑视的微笑。我把她搂得更紧了，这次一直贴到我的脸上。





第五章


那天夜里我回到西半岛的时候，有一小会儿我担心是我的房子着火了。那时已是凌晨两点，但远远望去半岛的整个一角亮得如同白昼，亮光照在灌木丛上显得虚无缥缈，照在路边的电线上拖出一条条细长的闪光。车子转了个弯，我才发现原来是盖茨比的别墅，从塔楼到地窖都灯火通明。

起初我还以为又在开晚会，一次放纵的狂欢，把整个别墅统统敞开，大家正在玩捉迷藏或“罐头沙丁鱼”之类的游戏。可是一丁点的声响都没有。只有树丛中的风声作响，风吹舞着电线，灯光忽暗忽明，好像整幢别墅在对着黑夜眨眼睛。当我乘坐的出租车哼哼唧唧地开走的时候，我看到盖茨比穿过他家的草坪向我走来。

“你家看上去像在开世界博览会。”我说。

“是吗？”他心不在焉地回头望了一眼，“我刚刚到几间屋子里去看了看。我们俩一起去康尼岛35玩吧，老兄。坐我的车子去。”

“时间太晚了。”

“那么，到游泳池里泡一泡怎么样？我整个夏天还没下去过哩。”

“我得休息去了。”

“好吧。”

他等待着，望着我，尽力抑制住急切的心情。

“我和贝克小姐谈过了，”等了一会才我说，“我明天打电话给黛西，请她过来喝茶。”

“哦，那好嘛，”他心不在焉地说，“我不希望给您添麻烦。”

“哪天对您合适？”

“哪天对您合适？”他马上改正了我的话，“我不希望给您添麻烦，你清楚。”

“后天怎么样？”

他思考了一会。然后，他勉强地说：“我想先让人把草坪修剪一下。”

我们俩都低头看了看草地——我这边的草坪参差不齐，而他的那一大片草坪郁郁葱葱，修剪得整整齐齐的，两家的草坪之间有一条很明显的分界线。我猜他指的是我家的草坪。

“还有一件小事。”他吞吞吐吐，有些迟疑不定。

“你是不是希望推迟几天？”我问道。

“哦，跟那个没关系。至少……”他琢磨着如何措辞，“呃，我猜想……呃，我说，老兄，你挣钱不多，是吧？”

“不是很多。”

这句话似乎使他放下心来，他更有信心地继续说了下去。

“我猜想你挣钱不多，要是你不介意的话——你知道，我附带做点小生意，搞点副业，你明白。我想既然你挣钱不多——你在推销债券，是吧，老兄？”

“在尝试着做。”

“那么，你也许会对这事感兴趣。不需要花费太多时间，你就可以挣上一笔可观的收入。不过这是一件相当机密的事。”

我现在才意识到，如果当时环境不同，那次谈话可能是我一生中的转折点。但是，因为他的这个提议说得太露骨，太唐突，明摆着是为了酬谢我的帮助，我别无选择，只有立即打断他的话。

“我手头的事情很多，”我说，“非常感谢你，可是我不可能再接手更多的事情了。”

“你用不着跟沃尔夫山姆先生打任何交道的。”显然他以为我要回避午饭时提到的那种“关系”，但我肯定地告诉他是他误会了。他又等了一会，希望我再与他聊聊别的话题，但是我的心思完全不在这上面，没有搭理他，结果他只好不情愿地回家去了。

这一晚使我感到很兴奋，有点飘飘然。我猜想我一迈进自己的家门就倒头睡觉了，因此我不知道盖茨比究竟是否去了康尼岛，也不知他又花了几个钟头“随便看一看房间”，同时他的房子继续灯火辉煌。第二天早晨，我在办公室给黛西打了个电话，请她过来喝茶。

“别带汤姆来。”我提醒她。

“什么？”

“别带汤姆来。”

“谁是‘汤姆’？”她装糊涂。

约定的那天下起了倾盆大雨。上午11点钟，一个男的身披雨衣，拖着一台割草机，敲敲我的大门，说是盖茨比先生派他过来割草的。这使我想起了我忘了告诉我那芬兰女佣回来帮忙，于是我就开车去西半岛，在湿淋淋的、两边是白石灰墙的小巷子里找她，同时又买了一些茶杯、柠檬和鲜花。

花是多余的，因为下午2点钟从盖茨比家里送来一温室的鲜花，连同数不清的插花的器皿。一小时以后，大门被人小心翼翼地打开，盖茨比先生一身白色法兰绒西装，银色衬衫，金色领带，急急忙忙地跑了进来。他脸色煞白，眼圈发黑，看得出他一夜未眠。

“一切都准备好了吗？”他进门便问。

“草坪看上去很漂亮，如果你指的是草坪的话。”

“什么草坪？”他茫然地问道，“哦，是你院子里的草坪。”他从窗子里向外看，可是从他面部的表情来看，我相信他什么都没看见。

“看上去不错，”他含糊地说，“有份报纸说雨在四点左右会停，大概是《华尔街日报》吧。喝茶所需要的东西都备齐了吗？”

我把他带到食品储藏室里去，他用挑剔的目光看了一眼那个芬兰女佣。我们一起把甜食店里买来的十二块柠檬蛋糕细细检查了一番。

“这行吗？”我问道。

“当然行，当然行！很不错！”然后他又木讷地加了一句，“老兄！”

3点半左右雨渐渐小了，变成了潮湿的雾气，不时地还有几滴雨水像露珠一样在雾里飘着。盖茨比心不在焉地翻阅着一本克莱的《经济学》，每当芬兰女佣的脚步震动厨房的地板时，他就一惊，并且不时朝着模糊的窗户外面张望。仿佛一连串看不见然而让人心动的事件正在外面发生着。最后他站起身来，用犹疑的声音对我说，他要回家了。

“为什么要走？”

“没有人来喝茶啦。时间太晚了！”他看了看他的表，好像别处还有紧急的事情等着他去处理，“我不能在这里等上一整天。”

“别犯傻了，现在四点差两分钟呢。”

他哭丧着脸坐了下来，好像是我强迫他坐下似的，正在这时，传来一辆汽车拐进我巷子的声音。我们俩都跳了起来，然后我自己也有些担心地往院子里跑去。

仍在滴着水的，没有花瓣的紫丁香树下，一辆加长的敞篷汽车沿着汽车道开了过来。车子停了，黛西戴着一顶三角形的浅紫色帽子，脸侧向我们一边，笑容满面，万分欣喜地朝我看着。

“这儿真的是你住的地方吗，我最亲爱的？”

她那悠扬的嗓音在雨中让人听了心旷神怡。我得先倾听她那抑扬顿挫的声音，然后才能听明白她所说的话。一缕湿漉漉的头发贴在她面颊上，仿佛抹了一笔蓝色的颜料。我搀她下车的时候，看到她的手也被晶莹的水珠打湿了。

“你是爱上我了吗，”她在我耳朵边低声说，“要不然为什么非得我一个人来呢？”

“那是雷克兰特古堡36的秘密。叫你的司机到别处去，过一个小时再来。”

“弗迪，过一个钟头再回来。”然后她煞有介事地低声说，“他的名字叫弗迪。”

“汽油味影响他的鼻子吗？”

“我想没有，”她天真地说，“为什么？”

我们走进屋子里。使我大为惊异的是客厅里空荡荡的。

“哎，这真滑稽，”我大声说。

“什么滑稽？”

正在这时，大门上有人郑重其事地轻轻敲了一声，她转过头去看。我走到外面去开门。原来是盖茨比，他面色惨白，那只手像笨重的东西一样揣在上衣口袋里，两只脚站在一摊水里，瞪着我的眼睛，神色凄凉。

他大步从我身边走过，进了门廊，手还揣在上衣口袋里，好像受牵线操纵的木偶一样，突然一转身，走进客厅不见了。那样子一点也不滑稽。我意识到自己的心也在怦怦地跳个不停。外面雨下大了，我伸手把大门关上。

有半分钟之久，一点声响也没有。然后我听到从客厅里传来一阵哽咽似的低语声，偶尔伴有笑声，接着就是黛西的清脆而做作的声音：“又见到你，我真是太高兴了。”

一阵沉寂。时间长得叫人难以忍受。我在门廊里没事可做，只好走进房间。

盖茨比正斜倚在壁炉架上，两手仍然揣在口袋里，勉强装出一副悠然自得、甚至索然无味的样子。他的头极力往后仰，一直碰到一台早已废弃不用的大座钟钟面上。从这个位置上用那双神情迷惘的眼睛向下凝视着黛西，她坐在一张硬背椅子的边上，神色惊慌，姿态倒很优雅。

“我们以前见过。”盖茨比咕哝了一句。他瞥了我一眼，嘴唇张开想笑又没笑出来。幸好这一刻，那座钟受不了他的头的压力晃动起来，摇摇欲坠，他连忙转过身来用颤抖的手指把钟抓住，扶正放好。然后他坐了下来，正襟危坐，胳膊肘放在沙发的扶手上，手托住下巴。

“对不起，碰到钟了。”他说。

我自己的脸也火辣辣地涨得通红，像被热带的太阳烤过一样。我脑子里虽有千百句客套话，此刻，却一句也道不出来。

“那是一座很旧的钟。”我傻乎乎地告诉他们。

我想我们有一会儿大家都相信那座钟已经在地板上摔得粉碎了。

“我们多年不见了。”黛西说，语气尽可能地平和。

“到11月整整五年。”

盖茨比不假思索的回答至少使我们大家又愣了一分钟。我急中生智，建议他们帮我到厨房里去预备茶，两人都已经站起身来，可就在这时那可恶的芬兰女佣人用托盘把茶端了进来。

忙着递茶杯、送蛋糕乱了一阵子，忙乱之中却建立了一种表面上的格局。盖茨比退到了一边，当我跟黛西聊天时，他一个劲儿在我们俩之间看来看去，神情慌张，眼神忧郁。不过，保持平静并不是这次喝茶的目的，于是一有机会，我就找了个借口，站起身来要走。

“你要去哪里？”盖茨比立刻警觉地问道。

“我这就回来。”

“你走以前，我要跟你说几句话。”

他发疯似的跟我走进厨房，关上门，然后很痛苦地低声说：“啊，天哪！”

“怎么了？”

“这是个愚蠢的错误，”他把头摇来摇去地说，“大错而特错。”

“你不过是有些难为情罢了，没别的。”幸好我又补了一句，“黛西也有些难为情。”

“她难为情吗？”他难以置信地重复了一遍我的话。

“和你一样难为情。”

“别说得那么大声。”

“你的举动简直是个孩子，”我不耐烦地指责说，“不仅如此，你还很没礼貌。让黛西一个人孤单地坐在那里。”

他举起手来打断我的话，用一种令人难忘的责备的眼神看了我一眼，然后蹑手蹑脚把门打开，走回那间屋子。

我从后门走了出去——就像半小时前盖茨比那样从这里出去，紧张不安地围着房子转了一圈——跑向一棵黑黝黝的、长满节瘤的大树，树上枝繁叶茂，相互交织着，构成了一块挡雨的帆布。这时雨又哗哗地下大了，我那凸凹不平的草坪，虽然被盖茨比的园丁修剪得很整齐，现在却仍然布满了泥潭，好像史前时代的沼泽了。从树底下望出去，除了盖茨比的气派的豪宅之外，没有什么别的东西可看，于是我盯着它看了足足半个小时，好像康德盯着他的教堂尖塔一样。这座房子是十年前一位酿酒商在那个“仿古热”初期建造的，据说他曾答应为邻近所有的别墅支付五年的税款，条件是各位房主同意在他们的屋顶铺上稻草。或许是他们的拒绝使他“创建家业”的计划受到了致命的打击——他立刻就败落了。门上还挂着吊唁的黑色花圈，他的子女就把房子卖掉了。美国人虽然愿意、甚至渴望去打工做农奴，可是一向是坚决不肯当乡下佬的。

半小时以后，太阳又出来了。食品店的送货车沿着盖茨比的汽车道拐了个弯，送来他的佣人做晚餐用的原料——我敢肯定他本人一口东西也吃不下。一个女佣人开始打开楼上的窗子，在每个窗口前，露一下脸，然后，从正中的大窗户探出身子，若有所思地向花园里啐了一口唾沫。我该回去了。雨还在淅淅沥沥地下个不停，仿佛是他们俩窃窃私语的声音，不时地随着感情的迸发而变得高亢起来，四下又是一片静谧，我觉得屋子里面也是一片肃静了。

我走了进去——在厨房里弄出一切可能的响声，就差把炉子掀翻了——但我觉得他们一点声音也没有听到。他们两人各自坐在沙发的两头，目不转睛地看着对方，好像提出了什么问题，或者悬而未决，再也没有丝毫窘迫的痕迹了。黛西脸上泪水涟涟，我一进去，她就跳了起来，对着镜子用手绢擦起脸来。但是盖茨比身上却发生了一种令人不解的变化。他简直是容光焕发。虽然什么话也没说，一个高兴的姿势也没有，但是他身上散发出的那种喜气，充满了整个小小的房间。

“嘿，你好，老兄。”他说，仿佛他有好多年没见过我了。刹那间，我还以为他要走过来跟我握手哩。

“雨已经停了。”

“是吗？”等他明白我说话的意思，又发觉屋子里充满了一缕缕阳光时，他像一个气象预报员，又像一个欣喜若狂的光明守护神似的露出了笑容，把消息报告给黛西，“你看多有意思，雨停了。”

“我很高兴，杰伊。”她的声音既优美又哀婉感人，可是她表露的只是她的惊喜之情。

“我想邀请你和黛西一起到我家坐坐，”他说，“我很想带她四处看看。”

“你真的要我一起去吗？”

“当然了，老兄。”

黛西上楼去洗脸——我很惭愧地想起了我的毛巾，可惜已经太晚了——盖茨比和我在草坪上等她。

“我的房子很漂亮，是不是？”他问道，“瞧，阳光能够照到整座房子的正面。”

我表示赞同，房子的确很漂亮。

“是的。”他的目光掠过了每一扇拱门、每一座方塔，“我只花了三年时间就挣到了足够的钱来买这幢房子。”

“我原以为你的钱是靠继承得来的。”

“我确实继承了一笔钱，老兄，”他不假思索地说，“但是我在大恐慌期间损失了一大半——就是战争引起的那次大恐慌。”

我猜想他自己并不清楚他在说些什么，因为当我问他做的是什么生意时，他回答：“那是我自己的事。”话说出口他才意识到这个回答很不妥当。

“哦，我做过好几种生意，”他改口说，“我做过药品生意，后来又做过石油生意。可是现在我这两种生意我都不做了。”他聚精会神地看着我。“那么说你考虑过那天晚上我提起的那件事了？”

我还没来得及回答，黛西就从房子里出来了，她衣服上的两排铜纽扣在阳光中闪烁。

“是那边的那幢大房子吗？”她用手指着高声问。

“你喜欢吗？”

“我很喜欢，但是我不明白你怎么会一个人住在那儿。”

“我那里总是高朋满座，不分昼夜，都是些有意思的人，做着有意思的事情，那些社会各界的名流。”

我们没有走小路沿着海边过去，而是绕到大路上，从巨大的后门走了进去。黛西用她那具有磁性的嗓音低声赞美着呈现在眼前的一切，赞美在蓝天映衬下的这座中世纪城堡的黑色轮廓，赞美花园中的奇花异草：长寿花那四溢的芳香、山楂花和梅花飘逸的淡淡清香、还有淡金色“吻别花”的清香。当我们走到大理石台阶前，居然没有看到身着华丽服饰的人们从大门口进进出出，而且除了树上鸟儿的鸣叫，听不到一点声音，真是令人惊奇。

进入里面，我们信步穿过玛丽·安托万内特37式的音乐厅和王政复辟时期38风格的小客厅，我似乎感觉在每套沙发和每张桌子后面都藏着客人，他们奉命屏息不动，静静地等我们走过。当盖茨比关上“默顿学院图书室”39的门时，我敢起誓我听到了那个戴猫头鹰眼镜的人突然发出的如同幽灵一样的笑声。

我们走上楼，穿过一间间古色古香的卧室，里面铺满了玫瑰色和淡紫色的绸缎，摆满了色彩缤纷的鲜花，穿过一间间更衣室和弹子室，以及装有地下浴池的浴室——我们还闯进一间卧室，看见里面有一个穿着睡衣的人，不修边幅，正在地板上做俯卧撑。那是“寄宿生”克利普斯普林格先生。那天早上我看到过他垂头丧气地在海滩上游荡。最后我们来到盖茨比的套房，包括一间卧室、一间浴室和一间小书房。我们在书房里坐下，喝了一杯他从壁橱里取出来的法国荨麻酒。

他片刻不停地望着黛西，我猜想他是根据房间里的每一件物品在她那双迷人的眼睛里的反应重新衡量他们的价值。间或，他也环顾周围，迷茫地凝视他所拥有的这一切，好像她真实地、出人意料地和他待在一起，所有的一切都变得不再真实了。甚至有一次，他差点从楼梯上摔了下去。

他自己的卧室是所有房间中最简朴的一间——只有梳妆台上摆放着一副纯金的梳妆用具。黛西高兴地拿起了梳子梳了梳头发，引得盖茨比先生坐了下来，用手遮住眼睛笑了起来。

“这真是太有意思了，老兄，”他笑嘻嘻地说，“我简直不能……每当我想起……”

很明显，他精神状态已经历了两个阶段，眼下正进入第三个阶段。他经历了局促不安和大喜若狂后，此刻又由于她意想不到地出现在眼前感到惊讶不已。这件事是他长年以来，一直朝思暮想，梦寐以求的，可以说是咬紧了牙关盼啊盼，执著热切到令人无法想象的程度。而现在，因为反作用，他像一只发条上得太紧的时钟一下顶不住了，精疲力竭了。

过了一会儿，他恢复了平静，为我们打开了他的两个做工精致的特大衣橱，里面装满了他的西装、晨衣和领带，还有十几摞像砖头一样码得老高的衬衣。

“我有一个人在英国替我买衣服。每年春秋两季开始的时候，他都挑选一些衣服给我寄过来。”

他拿出一堆衬衣，开始一件一件地扔在我们面前，面料有纯麻布的、厚丝绸的、细法兰绒的，全都抖散开来，五颜六色摆满了一桌子。我们欣赏着的时候，他又继续抱来更多质地柔软华丽的衬衣，堆得越来越高——条子的、花纹的、方格的，珊瑚色的、苹果绿的、浅紫色的、浅橙色的、还有印着深蓝色组合字母的。忽然，黛西忍不住呜咽了一声，把头深深地埋进了那衬衣堆里，放声大哭起来。

“这些衬衣真是太漂亮了，”她抽泣着说，她的声音在厚厚的衣堆里变得闷声闷气了，“我看了很伤心，因为我从来没见过这么——这么好看的衬衣。”

看过房子之后，我们本来还打算去看看庭院和游泳池、水上飞机和仲夏的繁花——但是在盖茨比先生房间的窗外又下起雨来了，因此我们三人就站成一排，远眺水波荡漾的海面。

“如果不是有雾，从这里可以看见海湾对面你家的房子，”盖茨比说，“你家码头的尽头总有一盏绿灯通宵不灭地亮着。”

黛西蓦然伸出胳膊去挽着他的胳膊，但他似乎沉浸在他刚才所说的话里。可能他突然想到那盏灯对他的巨大意义已经永远消失了。与他跟黛西分开的遥远距离相比较，那盏灯曾经离她那么近，近得几乎可以碰到她，就好像星星和月亮那样近在咫尺。而现在它又变回了码头上的一盏绿灯。他为之神魂颠倒的宝物又减少了一件。

我开始在屋子里踱来踱去，在半明半暗的光线中仔细观察着那些模糊不清的陈设。一张挂在他的书桌上方墙上的巨幅照片吸引了我的注意力，照片上是一位身穿游艇服的上了年纪的男人。

“这是谁？”

“那个？那是丹·科迪先生，老兄。”

这个名字听着有点耳熟。

“他已经死了。多年前他是我最好的朋友。”

五斗橱上放着一张盖茨比本人的小照片，也是穿着游艇服的——盖茨比高昂着头，一副目中无人的表情——显然是18岁左右拍的。

“我很喜欢这张相片，”黛西嚷嚷道，“这种大背头的发型真帅！你从来没告诉我你留过大背头发型，也没告诉过我你有一艘游艇。”

“瞧这个，”盖茨比连忙说，“这里有好多剪报——都是关于你的。”

他们俩肩并肩站着看那些剪报。我正想要求看看他收藏的红宝石，电话忽然响了，盖茨比就拿起了听筒。

“是的……噢，我现在说话不方便……我现在说话不方便，老兄……我说的是一个小城市……他应该明白小城市的意思……得啦，如果底特律就是他心目中的小城市，他对我们没什么用处……”

他挂上了电话。

“到这儿来，快！”黛西在窗前喊道。

雨还在下，可是西方的乌云已经散开，海湾上空翻滚着粉红色和金色的彩云。

“看那儿，”她柔声道，过了一会又说，“我好想采一朵那粉红色的云彩，把你放在上面推来推去。”

这时，我想要走了，可是他们说什么也不答应。也许有我在场他们可以更加心安理得地待在一起。

“我知道我们干什么好了，”盖茨比说，“我们让克利普斯普林格弹钢琴。”

他走出屋子喊了一声“艾温”，又过了几分钟才回来，身后跟着一个难为情的、面容略显憔悴的年轻人，戴着一副玳瑁边眼镜，金黄色的头发稀稀疏疏的。这时他已经穿戴整齐，穿着一件敞领的运动衫、一双运动鞋和一条颜色模糊不清的帆布裤子。

“我们刚才打扰您锻炼身体了吗？”黛西有礼貌地问。

“我在睡觉，”克利普斯普林格先生不好意思地大声说，“我是说，我本来在睡觉。后来就起来了……”

“克利普斯普林格会弹钢琴，”盖茨比打断了他的话说，“是不是，艾温，老兄？”

“我弹得不好。我不会……谈不上会弹。我好久没练……”

“我们到楼下去。”盖茨比打断了他的话。他轻轻地按了一个开关。刹那间，整座房子灯火通明，灰暗的窗户都不见了。

在乐房里，盖茨比只打开钢琴旁边的一盏孤零零的落地灯。他用一根火柴颤抖着为黛西点着了香烟，然后和她一道坐在屋子另一头的一张长沙发上，那里没有灯光，除了光滑的地板发射着的大厅里透进来的光亮。

克利普斯普林格弹完了一曲《爱情的安乐窝》之后，在琴凳上转过身来，不太愉快地朝着黑暗中的盖茨比张望着。

“我已经完全生疏了，你看。我告诉你我弹不了。我已经好久没练……”

“别说那么多了，老兄，”盖茨比命令道，“弹吧！”

“每天清晨，

每天夜晚，

我们玩得欢畅……”

外面风刮得呼呼作响，海湾上隐隐传来一阵雷声。此刻西半岛华灯初上，从纽约开来的电气火车满载返家的乘客，在雨中疾驰而来。这是人们发生深刻变化的时刻，空气中洋溢着激动的情绪。

“有一件事是千真万确，

富人生财，穷人生……孩子。

二者同时，

此时彼时……”

走过去告辞的时候，我又看到那种疑惑的表情重新出现在盖茨比的脸上，好像他有点怀疑目前的幸福是否真实。毕竟已经过去快五年了！即便是那天下午，也一定有些时刻，黛西远不如他梦想中的那么好——这倒不是她本人的过错，而是由于他的幻想过于精彩，这种幻想已经超越了她本身，超越了一切东西。他以一种创造性的激情投入了这个幻梦之中，不断地添枝加叶，用迎面飘来的每一根绚丽的羽毛去修饰它。任何炽热的火焰和新鲜的活力都赶不上一个人心中堆积起来的万般情愫。

我注视着他的时候，我看得出他适当地调整了一下自己。他伸出手去抓住她的手。她在他耳边低低地说了些什么，他立即感情激动地转向她。我感觉是她的声音迷住了他，她那富有旋律、激越昂扬的嗓音，因为梦里也不会有那么美好的声音——她的声音是一首永恒的歌。

他俩已经把我忘了，黛西倒是抬起头来瞥了一眼，伸出手来。而盖茨比此刻根本就不认识我了。我再一次看了看他们，他们也回头看了看我，恍如隔世一般，沉浸在强烈的感情之中。于是我走出屋子，下了大理石台阶，走进雨中，留下他们两人偎依在一起。





第六章


大概在这个时候，一天早晨，一名野心勃勃的年轻记者从纽约赶来，登门造访盖茨比，请他发表一些观点。

“关于什么的观点？”盖茨比很有礼貌地问道。

“呃——随便发表个什么声明。”

在疑惑地谈了五分钟之后，事情的原委才弄清楚。原来这位记者在他报馆里曾经听人提到盖茨比的名字，可是却不肯透露为什么会提到他，或者他也不很明白。这天恰好他休息，于是就主动加班加点跑出城来“看看”。

这只是碰碰运气，但是这位记者的直觉却是对的。盖茨比的名声在这个夏天越来越大，差一点就要成为新闻人物了。那是千百个接爱他好音的人替他宣扬的结果，他们都成了他的身世经历的权威。当时的各种传言，如“通往加拿大的地下管道”之类，都和他的名字扯上了关系，还有一个长期流传的谣言，说他根本不是住在房子里，而是住在一艘看上去像座房子的船上，并且沿着长岛海岸秘密地来回游弋。但是为什么北达科他州的詹姆斯·盖兹能从这些谣言中得到满足，原因就不得而知了。

詹姆斯·盖兹——这是他的真名实姓，至少是他法律上的姓名。他是在17岁时改名换姓的，也是在他一生事业开始的那个特定时间更换的——当时他看见丹·科迪先生的游艇在苏必利尔湖40上最险峻的沙洲上抛锚。那天下午他穿着一件破旧的绿运动衫和一条帆布裤在海滩上游荡的时候，还是叫詹姆斯·盖兹；后来他借了一条小船，划到托洛美号游艇去警告科迪，半小时之内可能会起狂风吹翻他的游艇，也就是在那时他已经是杰伊·盖茨比了。

我想早在那个时候之前他已把这个名字准备好了。他的父母是终日操劳、碌碌无为的庄稼人——在他的思想里从来没有真正承认他们就是自己的父母。实际上长岛西半岛的杰伊·盖茨比是他自己的柏拉图式理念的派生物。他是上帝的儿子——这个称号，如果有什么含义的话，就是它的字面意思——因此他必须为他的天父效力，致力于追求一种宏大的、世俗的、华而不实的美。因此他想象的那样一个杰伊·盖茨比恰恰是一个十七岁的男孩能够想象的，并且一如既往地忠于这个理想形象。

有一年多的时间里，他在苏必利尔湖的南岸四处闯荡，或是捕鲑鱼，或是捞蛤蜊，或是干其他任何活计以求解决温饱问题。在那些令人振奋的日子里，他那晒得黝黑、越发结实的身体使他能够轻松地应付那些时而紧张时而松懈的工作。他早就跟女人有了交往，而且由于女人宠他，他倒瞧不起她们。他瞧不起那些年轻的处女，因为她们愚昧无知；他也瞧不起别的女人，因为她们常常为了一些事情歇斯底里地发作；但由于他那惊人的自以为是的态度，那些事情在他看来都是理所当然的。

但是他的内心一直处于躁动不安的状态。夜晚躺在床上的时候，各种稀奇古怪、荒诞不经的念头便向他袭来。一个无法形容的浮华世界浮现在他的脑海里，此时，洗脸架上的小钟在滴答滴答地走着，他胡乱扔在地上的衣服浸泡在如水一样的月光里。每个晚上，他都要为自己的想象增添一些新的内容，直至浓浓的睡意静悄悄地包围了他，遮盖住他脑中形象逼真的场景方才作罢。有一阵子，这些幻梦为他丰富的想象力提供了一个发泄的途径：它们令人满意地暗示现实是不真实的，同时也表明世界的基石是牢牢地建立在仙女的翅膀41上的。

几个月以前，一种追求飞黄腾达的本能引导他前往明尼苏达州南部，路德教会办的圣奥拉夫学院。他在那里只待了两个星期，一方面由于学院对他如鼓声一样起起落落的命运以及对命运本身漠不关心，他感到很失望；另一方面他不屑于为了支付学费去做勤杂的工作。后来他四处游荡又回到了苏必利尔湖，那天他还在找点什么活儿做的时候，丹·科迪的游艇在湖边的浅滩上抛锚停泊了。

科迪当年五十岁，他是自1875年以来每一次淘金热的幸运儿，从内华达州的银矿到育空地区42的金矿都能看到他的身影。在蒙大拿州做的铜矿生意使他挣了好几百万的财产，之后他虽然身体仍然强壮，但脑子却开始糊涂。不计其数的女人对这一情况有所察觉，千方百计的要把他的钱弄到自己的手中。有个名叫埃拉·凯的女记者抓住他的弱点扮演了德曼特农夫人43的角色，怂恿他乘游艇航海；她玩弄的那些不太光彩的手腕成了1902年满天飞的花边新闻。他沿着海岸航行了五年，沿途受到了居民热情的款待，就在这一天他来到了少女湾，这为詹姆斯·盖兹命运的转折点。

年轻的盖兹，两手支在船桨上，抬头望着有栏杆围着的甲板，对他来讲，那艘船象征着这世上所有的美丽和魅力。我猜想他对科迪笑了笑——他大概早已发现他的微笑很讨人喜欢。不管怎么说，科迪问了他几个问题44，为他买了一件蓝色外套、六条白帆布裤子和一顶游艇帽。等到托洛美号起程前往西印度群岛和巴巴平海岸45的时候，盖茨比也跟着船走了。

他以一种不太明确的私人雇员身份在科迪手下工作——先后做过服务生、大副、船长、秘书，甚至还当过看守，因为清醒时的丹·科迪知道自己喝醉酒的时候什么挥金如土的傻事都做得出来，因此他越来越信任盖茨比，以防止这类意外事故的发生。这种情况持续了五年之久，在这期间那艘船绕着美洲大陆航行了三圈——本来可能会无限期地继续下去，要不是有一天晚上在波士顿靠岸时，埃拉·凯上了船，一个星期后，丹·科迪就凄凉地去世了。

我记得那张挂在盖茨比卧室里的他的照片，一个满头银发、面色红润的老人，面部坚毅而空虚——沉湎酒色的美国早期拓荒者的典型，他在美国社会生活的某个阶段把西部边疆的妓院和酒馆里的那种放荡不羁带到了东部沿海地区。盖茨比很少喝酒，这间接地归因于科迪。有时在欢闹的聚会上，女人们会把香槟酒揉进他的头发，他却独善其身，养成了滴酒不沾的习惯。

他从科迪那里继承了一笔钱——一笔二万五千美元的遗赠。但他并没得到一分钱。他始终也没弄清楚人家用什么法律手段来对付他的，剩下的几百万财产通通归了埃拉·凯。他得到的只是独特却又恰当的教育：杰伊·盖茨比的模糊的形象开始变得清晰起来，成为一个有血有肉的男子汉。

很久以后他才告诉了我这一切，但是我在这里写出来是为了驳斥最初那些关于他的身世来历的荒唐流言，那全是捕风捉影，没有一点根据。还有，他是在一个十分混乱的时刻告诉我的，那时我正对关于他的种种传闻半信半疑。所以我现在利用这个间歇，就好比让盖茨比有个喘息的机会，澄清一下那些以讹传讹的东西。

在我和他的交往之中，这也是一个间歇。有好几个星期我既没和他见面，也没接到过他打来的电话——大部分时间我在纽约跟乔丹四处闲逛，同时尽力讨好她那年迈的姑妈——不过最终在一个星期日的下午，我去了他家。我待了还不到两分钟，就有一个人把汤姆·布坎南带进来喝酒。我自然吃了一惊，但是真正令人惊奇的是布坎南以前竟然还没有来过这里。

他们一行三人是骑马来的——汤姆和一个名叫斯隆的男人，还有一个身穿棕色骑装的美丽女人，她以前来过这里。

“我很高兴见到你们，”盖茨比站在门廊里说，“欢迎你们光临。”

好像他们还很在乎他高兴不高兴，欢迎不欢迎呢！

“请坐，请坐。抽香烟还是雪茄？”他在屋子里来回走着，忙着按铃喊人，“我马上就让人给你们送点喝的来。”

汤姆的到来使他大感意外。但是不管怎样，只有先招待他们一番，他才不会局促不安，因为他也隐约意识到他们上门就是为了歇歇脚喝杯水。斯隆先生什么都不要。来杯柠檬水？不，谢谢。要么来点香槟？什么都不用，谢谢……对不起……

“你们一路上骑马很开心吧？”

“这附近的路很好走。”

“我想来往的汽车……”

“是啊。”

此刻盖茨比突然情不自禁地转过脸来对着汤姆，刚才介绍的时候，只当彼此是第一次见面。

“我想我们以前在什么地方见过面，布坎南先生。”

“噢，不错，”汤姆有礼貌地粗声应道，很显然他并不记得，“我们见过面，我记得很清楚。”

“大约是两个星期以前。”

“是啊。当时你和尼克在一起。”

“我认识你太太。”盖茨比继续说，几乎有一点挑衅的味道。

“是吗？”

汤姆转过脸来问我。

“你住在这附近吗，尼克？”

“就在隔壁。”

“是吗？”

斯隆先生没有参加谈话，而是懒洋洋地仰靠在椅子上。那个女的也不吭声——直到两杯加冰块的威士忌下肚后，她才忽然有说有笑起来。

“盖茨比先生，我们都来参加你下次的聚会，”她提议说，“你看好吗？”

“当然好了。你们能来，我太高兴了。”

“那好吧，”斯隆先生说，没有一点感谢之意，“呃——我想我们该回家了。”

“请别着急走。”盖茨比挽留他们。他现在已经能控制自己，他想多了解一下汤姆，“你们为什么不——你们为什么不就在这儿吃晚饭呢？说不定纽约还有一些别的人会来。”

“还是你到我家来吃晚饭吧，”那位太太热情地说，“你们俩一起过来。”

这也包括了我。此时斯隆先生站起身来。

“我是当真的，”她坚持说，“我真希望你们来。有的是地方。”

盖茨比疑惑地看着我。他想去，他没有看出斯隆先生已经打定了主意不让他跟着去。

“我恐怕去不了。”我说。

“那么，你来吧。”她极力怂恿盖茨比一个人。

斯隆先生凑近她耳朵边低语了几句。

“如果我们现在就走，不会迟到的。”她坚持大声说。

“我没有马，”盖茨比说，“我在军队里骑过马，但是我自己从来没买过马。我只好开车跟你们走。对不起，请稍等我一下。”

我们其余几个人走到外面门廊里，斯隆和那位太太站在一边。开始激烈的争吵。

“天哪，我相信这家伙真的要来，”汤姆说，“难道他不知道她并不想要他来吗？”

“她说她要他来的嘛。”

“她要举行一次大型的晚宴，他在那儿一个人也不会认识的。”他皱着眉头说，“真是奇怪，他到底在哪儿认识黛西的。天晓得，也许我的思想太守旧了，可是这年头女人到处乱跑，我可看不惯。她们总是遇到形形色色的奇怪的人。”

突然，斯隆先生和那位太太走下台阶，上了马。

“走吧，”斯隆先生对汤姆说，“我们已经晚了，赶紧走吧。”然后对我说，“请你告诉他我们等不及了，好吗？”

汤姆跟我握手告别，其余的人彼此淡淡地点了点头，他们就骑着马沿着车道策马飞奔，很快消失在八月茂密的林荫里。这时，盖茨比手里拿着帽子和一件薄薄的外套，正从大门里走出来。

很显然，汤姆对于黛西一人外出活动很不放心，因为随后的那个星期六的晚上，他陪同黛西一起来参加盖茨比的聚会。或许是由于他的到来，那次聚会的气氛格外的沉闷——它鲜明地留在我记忆里，与那个夏天盖茨比的其他聚会完全不同。还是那些同样的人，或者至少是同一类的人、同样的有那么多喝也喝不完的香槟、同样的五花八门、人声鼎沸的喧闹，可是我能感觉到空气中的一丝不友好，弥漫着一种前所未有的不和谐音符。要不然，或许是我本来已经逐渐习惯了这一切，习惯了把西半岛看作是一个独立完整的世界，有它自己的标准和了不起的人物。它首屈一指，因为它跟谁相比都不会感到逊色，而现在我却要通过黛西的眼睛去重新审视这一切。从新的视角去审视那些你已经花费了很多气力才适应的事物，总是让人十分难受的。

他们在黄昏时分到达的，随后，当我们几人漫步走到几百名珠光宝气的客人当中时，黛西又施展出她那套说话柔声细语的功夫。

“这儿的一切真叫我兴奋，”她低声说，“今晚上不管什么时候你想吻我，尼克，你让我知道好了，我会很乐意为你安排。喊我一声就行，或者出示一张绿色的请柬。我正在散发绿色的……”

“四处看看。”盖茨比提议。

“我正在四处看啊。我开心极了……”

“你一定看到许多久闻大名的人物。”

汤姆傲慢地扫了一眼人群。

“我们平时不大外出，”他说，“事实上，我刚刚在想这里的人我都不认识。”

“也许你认识那位女士。”盖茨比指着一位貌若天仙的美人，她端庄地坐在一棵白梅树下。汤姆和黛西目不转睛地望着，眼睛里流露出一种难以置信的神情；他们认出来这是一位一向只在银幕上见到的大明星。

“她好美啊。”黛西说。

“站在她身边弯着腰的是她的导演。”

盖茨比郑重其事地领着他们到一拨又一拨的客人中，为他们做介绍。

“这位是布坎南夫人……这位是布坎南先生，”稍稍迟疑了一会儿，他又补充说，“马球健将。”

“哦，不是的，”汤姆急忙否认，“我可不是。”

但是盖茨比显然喜欢这个称谓，因为在那天晚上余下的时间里，汤姆就一直是“马球健将”。

“我从来没见过这么多的社会名流，”黛西激动地说，“我喜欢那个人……他叫什么名字来着？……就是鼻子有点发青的那位。”

盖茨比说出了那人的姓名，并说他是一个小制片人。

“哦，我就是喜欢他。”

“我倒宁愿不做什么马球健将，”汤姆高兴地说，“我情愿以……以一个默默无闻的人的身份在一边看看这么多有名的人。”

黛西和盖茨比跳起了舞。我还记得我被他那优雅、老式的狐步舞姿惊呆了——在此之前我从未见过他跳舞呢。后来他俩溜到了我家，在台阶上坐了半个小时，而我，则应她的请求，在花园里给他们望风。“万一着火或是发大水了。”她解释说，“或是什么天灾啦。”

我们坐下来正打算吃晚饭，汤姆不知从哪里钻出来了。“我跟那边几个人一起吃饭，你们不介意吧？”他说，“那边有个家伙说话挺有意思。”

“去吧，”黛西和颜悦色地回答，“如果你想记下什么人的住址，就用我的小金铅笔。”……过了一会，她四面张望了一下，对我说那个姑娘“俗气，但是很漂亮”，于是我明白除了她跟盖茨比单独待在一起的半个钟头之外，她玩得并不开心。

我们这一桌的人都喝得醉醺醺的。这都怪我——盖茨比被叫去听电话了，加之两个星期前我刚与这些人玩过，感觉有些意思，但是当初我觉得有趣的东西，现在变得索然无味了。

“你感觉怎么样，贝达克小姐？”

我同她说话的这个姑娘正在想慢慢倒在我的肩上，听到我这么一问，她坐起身来，睁开了眼睛。

“什么？”

一个身材臃肿、懒洋洋的女人，本来一直在怂恿黛西明天到当地俱乐部跟她打高尔夫球的，此刻帮着贝达克小姐说起话来：“噢，她现在好多了。她每次喝上五六杯鸡尾酒，就会像这样大喊大叫。我跟她说过别再喝了。”

“我是不喝了。”被数落的姑娘有气无力地辩解道。

“我们听到你嚷嚷，于是我跟这位希维特医生说：‘医生，那里有人需要您帮忙。’”

“我相信她一定很感激，”另一位朋友并不领情地说，“可是你把她的头摁到游泳池里去的时候，把她的衣服全弄湿了。”

“我最讨厌的就是把我的头摁到游泳池里，”贝达克小姐叽里咕噜地说，“有一回在新泽西他们差点把我淹死。”

“那你就不应当喝酒嘛。”希维特医生反驳道。

“说说你自己吧！”贝达克小姐声嘶力竭地喊道，“你的手发抖。我才不会让你给我做手术呢！”

情况大致就是这样。我记得差不多最后一件事就是我和黛西站在一起，看着电影导演和他的那位“大明星”。他们依旧待在那棵白梅树下，他俩的脸快要贴到一处去了，中间只隔着一线薄薄的轻柔的月光。我忽然想到他整个晚上都在慢慢地慢慢地弯腰靠近她，直到这时才贴近她，就在我注视的当口，我看到他又将身子弯下去最后一点，吻到了她的脸颊。

“我喜欢她，”黛西说，“我觉得她真漂亮。”

但是其他的一切都使她反感——而且是不容争辩的，因为这并不是一种姿态，而是一种感情。她十分厌恶西半岛，这个由百老汇强加在一个长岛渔村上的前所未有的“胜地”——厌恶它那老套的委婉斯文下凸显的粗野的活力，厌恶它突兀的命运指引着当地的居民总想沿着一条捷径获取成功，到头来却一无所有。她正是在这种她所不明白的单纯之中看到了什么恐怖的东西。

他们在等自己的车子开过来时，我跟他们一起坐在大门前的台阶上。前面一片漆黑，只有敞开的大门射出十平方英尺的亮光，融进了柔和幽暗的晨曦。有时楼上的化妆间遮帘映出一个移动的人影，接着又出现一个人影，这些影影绰绰的女宾客对着一面从外面看不见的镜子涂脂抹粉。

“这个姓盖茨比的到底是什么人？”汤姆突然问道，“一个大私酒走私犯？”

“你在哪儿听到的？”我问他。

“不是听到的，是我推测的。很多这样的新暴发户都是大私酒走私犯。”

“盖茨比可不是。”我简短地说。

他沉默了片刻。汽车道上的鹅卵石在他脚底下嘎吱嘎吱作响。

“呃，他肯定花费了很大的力气才把这么乱七八糟的家伙聚集到一起。”

一阵清风吹动了黛西的毛茸茸的灰色毛领子。

“至少他们比我们认识的那些人有趣得多。”她有点勉强地说。

“你看上去并不是很感兴趣嘛。”

“不，我很感兴趣。”

汤姆哈哈一笑，把脸转向我。

“当那个女孩让黛西给她冲个冷水澡的时候，你有没有注意到黛西的脸？”

黛西跟着音乐低声唱了起来，声音沙哑而有节奏的，赋予了歌曲的每一个词一种以前从未有过、以后也决不会再有的含义。当旋律升高的时候，她的嗓音也跟着改变，像女低音一样悠扬婉转，而且每一点变化都向空气中倾泻出一点她那温情脉脉的魅力。

“有很多人都是不请自来的，”她忽然冒出了一句，“那个姑娘就没有受到邀请。他们就这么自己闯进来了，而他又太客气，不好意思谢绝他们。”

“我很想弄清楚他是什么人，是干什么的，”汤姆固执地说，“并且我一定要查个水落石出。”

“我现在就可以告诉你，”她答道，“他是开药店的，开了好多家药店。全是他一手创办起来的。”

这时，那辆姗姗来迟的豪华轿车沿着汽车道开了过来。

“晚安，尼克。”黛西说。

她的目光掠过我，朝着灯光照亮的最上面一级台阶看去，那里一曲当年流行的高雅略带伤感的小华尔兹舞曲《凌晨三点钟》正从敞开的大门流淌出来。毕竟，在盖茨比的随意轻松的聚会上，才有可能寻找到自由浪漫的情调，而这正是她自己的那个世界中所缺乏的。那支曲子里面仿佛有什么东西在召唤她前去？此时，在这朦胧的、不可预知的时刻里又即将发生什么事情呢？也许会有一位难以置信的客人飘然而至，某位世上少有的令人赞叹不已、真正光芒四射的少女只要对盖茨比看上一眼，两人目光交织的神奇的一刹那，就可以把五年来盖茨比对黛西的坚贞不移的爱情一笔勾销。

那个晚上我待到很晚，盖茨比要我等到他可以闲下来，于是我就在花园里游荡，一直等到最后一群游泳的客人从漆黑的海滩上跑上来，冻得浑身发抖却又情绪高涨，等到楼上客房里的灯光全部熄灭。等到他最后走下台阶时，我看见他脸上晒得黝黑的皮肤比往常绷得更紧，眼睛明亮而略显疲倦。

“她不喜欢这个聚会。”他立刻就说。

“她当然喜欢了。”

“她不喜欢，”他固执地说，“她玩得不开心。”

他不再说话了，但我猜他有种说不出的郁闷。

“我觉得离她很遥远，”他说，“很难让她理解。”

“你指的是舞会吗？”

“舞会？”他打了个响指，把他所有举办过的所有舞会都一笔勾销了，“老兄，舞会并不重要。”

他要求于黛西无非就是希望黛西径直走到汤姆跟前对他说：“我从来没有爱过你。”等她用这句话把他们过去四年的婚姻生活一笔勾销之后，他们就可以决定下一步需要采取的实际的行动。其中之一就是，等她恢复了自由身之后，他俩就回到路易斯维尔去，重新从她家里出嫁——如同五年以前一样。

“可是她不理解，”他说，“在过去她是能够理解的。我们常常在一起一待就是几个小时……”

他突然停住不说了，沿着一条小路走来走去，小路上铺满了果皮、丢弃的小礼物和碾碎的鲜花，显得一片荒芜。

“我看对她不宜要求过高，”我冒昧地说，“你不可能让过去重现的。”

“不能让过去重现？”他不以为然地喊起来，“哪儿的话，我当然可以了！”

他狂躁地东张西望，好像他的过去就隐藏在这里，隐藏在他房子的阴影里，几乎一伸手就可以够得着。

“我要把一切都恢复到过去的模样，”他说着，一面坚决地点点头，“她会看到的。”

他说了一大堆有关过去的事情，我推测他想要重新获得一点什么东西，也许是想要找回他自己的、使他爱上黛西的某种念头。从那时以来，他的生活一直是杂乱无章，但要是他能再一次回到某个出发点，慢慢地重新来过，他就能找出来那到底是什么东西……

……五年前一个秋天的夜晚，他俩走在一条落叶缤纷的街道上，来到一处没有树的地方，月光洒在人行道上，给它镀上了一层银白色的光辉。他们停了下来，面对面站着。那是一个凉爽的夜晚，是一年中季节更替的时刻，空气中充斥着那种令人兴奋的神秘。家家户户屋子里静静的灯火仿佛在向外面的黑暗吟唱；连天上的星星也你来我往，一片繁忙。盖茨比从他的眼角的余光，看到人行道两边的街区构成一架梯子，通向树顶上方一个神秘的地方——他可以攀登上去，如果他独自攀登的话，然后他就可以吮吸生命的乳汁，一口吞下那无与伦比的玉液琼浆。

当黛西白皙的脸靠近他自己的脸时，他的心跳加快了。他知道只要她亲吻了这个姑娘，他就会把他那些难以言表的憧憬和她短暂的呼吸紧密结合在一起，他的心灵就再也不会像上帝的心灵那样恣意驰骋了。因此他等着，再倾听一会那已经在一颗星上敲响的音叉。然后他吻了她。他的嘴唇一碰上她，她就像鲜花一样为他绽放了，于是一个理想的化身就完成了。

他倾诉的这一切，甚至他黯然神伤的表情，使我想起了一点什么……很久以前我在什么地方听过的一曲难以捉摸的旋律和几句零散的歌词。有一会儿，一句话快到了嘴边，我的双唇像哑巴一样张开了，仿佛除了一丝受惊的空气之外，还有什么要挣扎着从嘴唇上出来。但是嘴唇发不出声音来，而我几乎想起来的东西就永远无法表达了。





第七章


就在人们对盖茨比的好奇心达到顶点的时候，有一个星期六晚上，他别墅里的灯没有同往常一样灯火通明——于是，他作为古罗马大宴宾客的特里马尔乔46的生涯结束了；当初莫名其妙地开始，现在同样又莫名其妙地终止了。我发觉那些乘兴而来的一辆辆汽车，稍停片刻之后就败兴而归了。我担心他是不是病了，于是就去他家看看——一个满脸凶相的陌生的男管家从门口满腹狐疑地斜着眼看我。

“盖茨比先生病了吗？”

“没有。”停了一会他才慢吞吞地、很不情愿地加了一声“先生”。

“我好久没看见他了，很担心他。告诉他卡洛维先生来过。”

“谁？”他粗鲁地问道。

“卡洛维。”

“卡洛维。好的，我会告诉他的。”

说着，他“砰”的一声粗鲁地关上了大门。

我的芬兰女佣告诉我，盖茨比早在一个星期前就辞退了家里的所有佣人，另外雇用了六个佣人，这些人从来不到西半岛镇上采购，没有收过商贩们的贿赂，而是通过打电话订购一些适量的日用品。据送货的食品店伙计说，他家的厨房看上去像个猪圈，而镇上的人都说这一帮新雇来的人根本就不是佣人。

第二天，盖茨比打电话过来。

“准备出门吗？”我问。

“没有，老兄。”

“我听说你辞退了所有的佣人。”

“我想用些不爱嚼舌头的人。黛西经常过来——一般都在下午。”

原来如此，由于她看不习惯，这座大酒店就像纸牌搭起来的房子一样轰然坍塌了。

“他们是沃尔夫山姆想要帮忙的人，都是兄弟姐妹。他们过去经营过一家小酒店。”

“我明白了。”

他是应黛西的请求打电话来的——问我明天愿不愿意到她家吃午饭。还说贝克小姐会去的。半小时之后，黛西亲自打电话来，得知我会去好像松了一口气。一定出了什么事。

可是我不能相信他们竟然会选择这样一个场合来大闹一场——特别是盖茨比早先在花园里描画过的那种令人难堪的场面。

次日，天气酷热难耐，尽管夏天快要结束了，然而这天无疑是夏天中最热的一天。当我乘的火车从隧道里钻出来驶进阳光里的时候，只有全国饼干公司尖锐的汽笛声划破了中午闷热的寂静。车座上的草垫子热得简直要着火了。坐在我旁边的一个女人起先很斯文地任凭汗水浸透她的白色衬衣，后来，她捏在手里的报纸也变湿了，她长叹一声，在酷热中颓然地往后一倒。她的钱包啪的一声掉到了地下。

“哎呀！”她气喘吁吁地说。

我疲惫地弯下腰把钱包捡了起来，手伸得长长的，捏着它的一个角，还给了她，表示我对它并没有非分之想——但是周边的每个人，也包括那女人，依旧怀疑着我。

“太热了！”查票员对熟悉的乘客说，“可恶的鬼天气！热……热……热……你觉得够热吗？热吗？你觉得……”

当他把我的月票递还给我时，上面留下了他手上的黑色的汗渍。在这种酷热的天气还有谁会去在意他亲吻的是谁的红唇，谁在意是哪个姑娘弄湿了他胸前的睡衣口袋！

……盖茨比和我在门口等候开门的时候，一阵微风从布坎南的家的门廊吹过，传来了电话铃音。

“需要主人的尸体？”男管家大声地朝话筒喊道，“对不起，太太，可是我们不能提供——今天中午实在是太热了，没法碰！”

而实际上他所讲出来的话是：“好……好……我去看看。”

他把话筒放下，朝我们走了过来，大汗淋淋地接过我们的硬壳草帽。

“太太正在客厅里等您呢！”他大声叫道，没有必要地指着方向。在这酷热的天气里，任何一个无谓的动作都是在浪费人的精力。

这间屋子的外面有遮阳篷，屋内显得又阴暗又凉快。黛西和乔丹躺在一张巨大的长沙发上，就像两座银像一样，压住各自的白色衣裙，不让电扇那呼呼的风将衣裙吹起来。

“我们无法动弹。”她们俩异口同声地说。

乔丹的手晒得黝黑，上面搽了一层爽身粉。她把她的一只手放在我的手里搁了一会儿。

“我们的运动健将托马斯·布坎南47先生呢？”我问道。

就在这时我听见了他的声音，粗鲁、低沉略显沙哑，正在用大厅里的电话与什么人通着话。

盖茨比站在深红色的地毯中央，颇有兴致地四处张望。黛西看着他，发出了她那甜蜜、撩人的笑声。一缕香粉轻轻地从她胸口飘入空中。

“有传言说，”乔丹低声说，“电话那头是汤姆的情人。”

我们都默不作声。大厅里的声音因气恼而高了起来：“那好吧，我根本不打算把车子卖给你……我根本不欠你什么情……至于你在午饭时候为这点事来打扰我，我可受不了。”

“挂上话筒再说。”黛西讽刺地说。

“不，他不是。”我向她解释道，“确实有这笔交易。我碰巧知道这件事。”

汤姆猛地推开门，他粗壮的身躯顿时堵住了门口，然后急匆匆走进了屋子。

“盖茨比先生！”他伸出了他那宽大平滑的手，很巧妙地掩饰住了对他的厌恶，“很荣幸见到您，先生……尼克……”

“给我们来杯冷饮吧。”黛西嚷道。

汤姆再次离开屋子以后，她站起身，走到盖茨比面前，扳下他的脸来，亲吻他的嘴。

“你知道我爱你。”她喃喃地说。

“你忘了还有一位女士在旁边呢。”乔丹说。

黛西故意装傻回过头看看。

“你也亲吻尼克好了。”

“真是个低级、庸俗的女孩子！”

“我不在乎！”黛西大声说，同时在砖砌的壁炉前跳起舞来。后来她想起了酷热的天气，难为情地在沙发上坐了下来，正在这时，一个收拾得很干净的保姆拉着一个小女孩走进屋子来。

“亲爱的……宝贝，”她边张开双臂，边嗲声嗲气地说，“到疼你的妈妈这里来。”

保姆一松手，那孩子就从屋子那边跑过来，羞答答地一头栽进她母亲的衣裙里。

“亲爱的，我的宝贝，啊！妈妈把粉弄到你黄黄的头发上了吗？喏，站起身来，跟大家说声——您好。”

盖茨比和我先后弯下腰来，拉了拉孩子勉强伸出的小手。然后他惊讶地目不转睛地看着孩子。我想他在这以前从未真正相信过这个孩子的存在。

“我在午饭前就穿好衣服了。”孩子说着，急切地把脸转向黛西。

“那是因为你妈妈要夸耀你。”她把脸埋进孩子那雪白的小脖子上的细细的皱纹里，“你啊，你这个宝贝。你这个天使般的小宝贝。”

“是啊，”小姑娘平静地回答，“乔丹阿姨也穿了一件白裙子。”

“你喜欢妈妈的朋友吗？”黛西把她转过来，让她正对着盖茨比，“你觉得他们漂亮吗？”

“爸爸去哪儿了？”

“她长得不像她爸爸，”黛西解释说，“她长得像我。她的头发和脸型都像我。”

黛西身子往后靠在了沙发上。保姆走上前一步，伸出手来。

“来吧，帕米。”

“再见，宝贝！”

小孩很懂事，依依不舍地回头看了一眼，抓着保姆的手，就被拉到门外去了，正好这时，汤姆回来了，领着佣人端来了四杯杜松子利克酒，杯子里装满了冰块叮当作响。

盖茨比接过一杯酒来。

“这酒绝对够凉。”他说，看得出来他有点紧张。

我们急不可耐地大口大口地喝起来。

“我在什么地方看到过，说是太阳一年比一年热，”汤姆很和气地说，“又说地球很快就会掉进太阳里去——等等——恰恰相反——是太阳一年比一年冷。”

“走，到外面去，”他向盖茨比提议，“我想带你看看我这个地方。”

我随他们一起到外面的阳台上去。在碧绿的海湾上，海水在酷热中停滞不动，一条小帆船慢吞吞地驶向比较新鲜的海域。盖茨比的目光追随了它一会儿。他举起了手，指着海湾的对岸。

“我就在你的对岸。”

“可不是嘛。”

我们的目光掠过玫瑰花圃，掠过发烫的草坪，掠过海滩边那些大热天疯长的乱草丛。那只小船的白帆正慢慢地驶向蔚蓝清凉的天际。再往前是碧波荡漾的海洋和星罗棋布的小岛。

“那叫运动呢，”汤姆点着头说，“我真想出去和他在那边玩上个把小时。”

我们在餐厅里吃的午饭，里面也遮得很阴凉，大家就着凉啤酒将紧张和欢笑一起喝下肚去。

“我们今天下午玩些什么好呢？”黛西大声说，“明天呢，还有接下来的三十年？”

“别发神经了，”乔丹说，“到了秋天，天高气爽，生活就又重新开始了。”

“可是天太热了，”黛西固执地说，眼泪差点要掉下来，“一切又都变得乱七八糟的。咱们一起进城去吧！”

她的声音继续在热浪中穿行，击打着热浪，把无知觉的热气塑成一些形状。

“我听说过把马厩改做车库，”汤姆在对盖茨比说，“但是我是第一个把车库变成马厩的人。”

“谁愿意进城去？”黛西执拗地问道。盖茨比的眼睛慢慢朝她看过去。“啊，”她喊道，“你看起来真帅。”

他们的目光相遇了，他们俩都目不转睛地看着对方，好像世间别无他物。她好不容易才把目光转回到餐桌上。

“你看上去总是那么帅。”她又说了一遍。

她已经跟他说她爱他，汤姆·布坎南也看出来了。他大吃一惊。他的嘴微微张开，看看盖茨比，又看看黛西，仿佛他刚刚认出她是一个他很久以前就认识的朋友。

“你很像一个广告里的那个男子汉，”她毫无觉察地继续说，“你知道广告上的那人……”

“好吧，”汤姆立即打断了她的话，“我非常乐意进城去。走吧——我们一块进城去。”

他站了起来，眼睛还是在盖茨比和他妻子之间瞅来瞅去。谁也没动。

“走啊！”他有点发火了，“到底怎么回事？要进城的话，现在就走吧。”

他竭力控制着自己的情绪，手发起抖来，把杯中剩下的啤酒举到了嘴边一饮而尽。黛西招呼着大家站起来，一起走到外面滚烫的石子汽车道上。

“我们现在就走吗？”她反对说，“就像这样？我们是不是要先让人家抽支烟再走？”

“吃饭的时候大家不是一直都在抽烟吗？”

“哦，咱们开开心心玩儿吧，”她央求他，“天太热了，我们别争了。”

他没有作答。

“随你的便吧，”她说，“来吧，乔丹。”

她们上楼去做准备，剩下我们三个男的站在那儿，用脚拨弄着地上滚烫的小石子。银月已经爬到了西边的天空。盖茨比刚想开口说话，却又改变了主意，想合上嘴巴，但汤姆已经转过身来期待地看着他。

“你的马厩是在这里吗？”盖茨比费劲地问。

“沿这条路往下走大约四分之一英里的地方。”

“哦。”

停了一会儿。

“我真不明白为什么要去城里，”汤姆气势汹汹地说，“女人总是心血来潮……”

“我们带点儿什么饮料喝吗？”黛西从楼上窗口探出身来喊道。

“我去拿点威士忌来。”汤姆应道。他走进屋里去。

盖茨比挺直了身子，转向我说：“我在他家里不能说什么，老兄。”

“她说话很不慎重，”我说，“话里充满了……”我迟疑了一下。

“她话音中充满了金钱。”他冷不丁地说。

正是如此。我以前从来没有领悟过。她言语中确实是充满了金钱味——这正是她声音抑扬顿挫的无穷魅力所在，金钱的叮当作响声，铙钹齐鸣的歌声……好像高高在上的白色王宫里，国王的女儿，黄金女郎……

汤姆从屋子里出来，用毛巾包着一瓶一夸脱的酒，身后跟着黛西和乔丹，两人都戴着金属布做成的小而紧的帽子，手臂上搭着薄纱披肩。

“大家一起坐我的车去吧？”盖茨比提议。他摸了摸晒得滚烫的绿皮坐椅。“我本该把车停在树阴里的。”

“这车用的是标准排挡吗？”汤姆问道。

“是的。”

“好吧，你开我的小轿车，让我开你的车进城。”

这个提议不符合盖茨比的口味。

“恐怕汽油剩得不多了。”他表示不同意。

“汽油多得很。”汤姆粗暴地说。他看了看油表。“如果汽油用光了，我可以找一个杂货店停下来。这年头杂货店里你什么东西都可以买到。”

听了这句似乎没有什么意义的话之后，大家都没做声。黛西皱着眉头看了看汤姆，同时盖茨比脸上浮现出一种难以言状的表情，既十分陌生又似曾相识，这种表情我以前应该只是听别人用言语描述过。

“走吧，黛西，”汤姆说，一面用手把她推到盖茨比的车子跟前，“我开这辆马戏团的大篷车带你。”

他打开车门，但她从他的臂弯里挣脱出来。

“你带尼克和乔丹。我们坐小轿车跟在你们后面。”

她走过去紧靠着盖茨比，用手碰了碰他的上衣。乔丹、汤姆和我坐进盖茨比车子的前座，汤姆尝试着扳了扳不熟悉的排挡，接着我们箭一般地冲进了酷热当中，把他们远远地甩在了后面。

“你们看到了没有？”汤姆问。

“看到什么？”

他目光敏锐地看着我，意识到我和乔丹肯定一直就知道这件事。

“你们以为我很傻，是不是？”他说，“也许我很傻，但是有时候我有一种——几乎是一种第二视觉，它会告诉我该怎么办。也许你们不相信这个，可是科学……”

他不往下说了。眼前的紧急事件刻不容缓，把他从理论深渊的边缘拉了回来。

“我对这个家伙进行了一番小调查，”他继续说，“我原本可以调查得更深入一些，要是我知道……”

“你是说你找过一个巫师吗？”乔丹幽默地问。

“什么？”他疑惑不解地看着我们哈哈大笑，“巫师？”

“关于盖茨比的事啊。”

“关于盖茨比的事！不，我没有。我刚才说我已经对他的身世做过一番小小的调查。”

“结果你发现他上过牛津大学。”乔丹帮忙地说。

“上过牛津大学！”他难以置信，“就凭他！瞧他穿的那套粉红色衣服。”

“不过他还是上过牛津的。”

“新墨西哥州的牛津镇吧，”汤姆轻蔑地说，“或者类似的地方。”

“我说，汤姆，你既然这样瞧不起他，为什么还要请他吃午饭呢？”乔丹生气地质问道。

“是黛西请他的。她是在我们结婚前就认识他了——天知道是在什么地方认识的！”

这时啤酒的酒劲已过，我们都变得烦躁不安起来，大家都意识到这一点，于是我们就一声不响地开了一会车子。然后当T.J.埃科尔堡大夫那双褪色的眼睛在大路的前方出现时，我想起了盖茨比提醒过的汽油不够的事。

“汽油足够我们开到城里。”汤姆说。

“可是这里正好有一家车行，”乔丹反对说，“我可不要车子在这种热得冒烟的天气里抛锚。”

汤姆不耐烦地踩了两边的刹车，车子扬起一阵尘土，猛地停在了威尔逊车行的招牌下面。过了一会儿，老板从屋子里面走了出来，两眼茫然地看着我们的车子。

“给我们加点汽油！”汤姆粗声粗气地喊道，“你以为我们把车停在这里做什么——欣赏风景吗？”

“我生病了，”威尔逊说道，身子站着不动，“病了一整天了。”

“怎么回事？”

“我身体都垮了。”

“那么，要我要自己加油吗？”汤姆说道，“你刚才在电话里听上去还挺好的嘛。”

威尔逊很吃力地从门口的阴凉处走出来，大口地喘着粗气，拧开了汽油箱的盖子。阳光下，他的脸色发青。

“我并不是有意打扰你吃午饭，”他说，“可是我急需用钱，因此我想知道你打算怎么处理你的那辆旧车子。”

“你觉得这一辆怎么样？”汤姆问，“我上星期刚买的。”

“好漂亮的黄车。”威尔逊说，一面用力地握住加油嘴的把手。“想买吗？”

“倒是个好机会，”威尔逊淡淡地一笑，“不想要这个，可是我可以在那部车上赚点钱。”

“你要钱干什么，还要得这么急？”

“我在这里待得太久了。我想离开这里。我老婆和我想搬到西部去。”

“你老婆想去？”汤姆吃惊地叫道。

“这件事她已经说了有十年了。”他靠在加油泵上休息了片刻，用手搭在眼睛上遮住阳光，“现在她真的要去了，不管她想不想去。我要带她走。”

黛西他们开的那辆车从我们身边疾驰而过，扬起了一阵尘土，车上的人冲我们挥了挥手。

“我该付你多少钱？”汤姆生硬地问道。

“就在这两天我刚刚发觉事情有点蹊跷，”威尔逊说，“这就是我想要离开这里的原因。也是我为那辆车子打搅你的原因。”

“我该付你多少钱？”

“一块二。”

无情的热浪一波接一波，开始搞得我头昏眼花，我有一会儿感到很不舒服，后来我才意识到，直到这时威尔逊还没有怀疑到汤姆身上。他发现了梅特尔背着他，在另外一个世界里有她自己的生活，而这一发现使他一下子病倒了。我盯着他看了看，又盯着汤姆看了看，汤姆在不到一小时以前也有了同样的发现——我忽然觉得人们在智力或种族方面的任何差异，都远远不及病人和身体健康的人二者之间的差异那么巨大。威尔逊病得这么重，看上去好像犯了什么罪一样，犯了什么不可饶恕的罪行——就好像他刚刚把一个可怜的姑娘的肚子弄大了。

“我会把那辆车子卖给你的，”汤姆说，“明天下午我就给你送来。”

那一带地方总是令人隐隐约约感到心神不安，即使在艳阳高照的下午也一样。我于是转过头去，好像有人提醒我背后有什么东西。在灰堆上方，是日夜守望着的T.J.埃克尔堡大夫的那双巨大的眼睛，但是过了一会之后，我发觉在离我们不到二十英尺远的地方，有另外一双眼睛正在不到二十英尺的地方全神贯注地注视着我们。

在车行上面一扇窗户里，窗帘被稍稍拉开了一点，梅特尔·威尔逊正在往下窥视着我们的车子。她是那么全神贯注，以至于完全没有察觉有人在注意她。一种接一种的表情在她脸上显露出来，好像物体在冲洗的底片上慢慢地显影一样。她的表情熟悉得有点古怪——这是我经常在女人脸上看到的表情，但是在梅特尔·威尔逊的脸上出现，这种表情似乎毫无缘由而且令人不解；慢慢地我才意识到她那两只充满妒火、睁得大大的眼睛并不是盯着汤姆，而是在盯着乔丹·贝克，原来她误认为乔丹是他的妻子。

一个单纯的头脑一旦陷入慌乱，那就非同小可。等到我们乘车离开的时候，汤姆感到惊慌失措，像有灼热的鞭子在抽打他一样。他的妻子和情妇，直到一小时前还是安然无恙且不容侵犯的，现在却猝不及防地一下子挣脱了他的控制。他本能地猛踩油门，一方面想追上黛西，另一方面想把威尔逊抛在脑后，于是我们以每小时五十英里的速度向阿斯托里亚飞驰而去。直到在高架铁路蜘蛛网一样的钢架中，我们才看见那辆逍遥自在的蓝色小轿车。

“第50号大街附近那些大电影院很凉快，”乔丹提议说，“我喜爱夏日午后的纽约，路上行人稀少。有一种肉感——熟透了，仿佛各种珍奇的果实纷纷掉落在你手里。”

“肉感”这个词使汤姆感到更加惴惴不安，但他还没来得及找到理由来表示反对，那辆小轿车就已经停了下来，黛西打着手势示意我们开过去并排停下。

“我们到哪里去？”她喊道。

“去看电影怎样？”

“太热了，”她抱怨道，“你们去吧。我们去兜兜风，过会儿再与你们碰头。”她好不容易想出两句俏皮话。“我们约好在另一个街角碰头。我就是那个抽着两支烟的人。”

“我们别在这里争论，”汤姆不耐烦地说，这时一辆卡车在我们后面发出了刺耳的喇叭声，“你们跟着我开到中央公园南边的广场饭店前面。”

有好几次他转过头去找他们后面的车子，每当路上堵车，他们落在后面的时候，他就减慢速度直到他们赶上来。我想他生怕他们会突然钻进一条小巷子里去，从此永远从他生活里消失。

可是他们并没有这么做。接下去我们大家采取了一个更加让人难以理解的举动——在广场饭店租用了一间套房的会客厅。

那场长时间的、七嘴八舌的争吵，终于以我们都被赶进那间客厅而结束，到底吵些什么我已经记不起来了，但是我仍旧很清楚地记得当时我身体的感受，在这个过程中，我的内衣像一条湿漉漉的蛇一样顺着我的双腿向上爬，同时，不断渗出的汗珠隔一会儿就涔涔地从后背往下淌。这个主意最初是由黛西提出的，她建议我们租五间浴室去洗冷水澡，后来改成了更为具体的方案——“找个地方喝杯冰镇薄荷酒”。我们几个人都翻来覆去地说这是个“疯狂的想法”——我们异口同声地对一个左右为难的服务生讲话，我们以为或者假装认为，我们这么做很风趣……

那间房子很大，但却闷得很，虽然已经是下午四点了，但打开窗户后涌进来的只是从公园的灌木丛那里刮来的热风。黛西走到镜子前面，背对着我们梳理她的头发。

“这个套间真高级。”乔丹满怀敬意地低声说，引得大家都笑了起来。

“再打开一扇窗户。”黛西头也不回地命令道。

“没有别的窗户了。”

“那么，我们最好打电话要他们送把斧头来……”

“心静自然凉，”汤姆不耐烦地说，“像你这样唠唠叨叨只会让你热得更加难受。”

他打开毛巾取出那瓶威士忌来放在桌上。

“何不由着她呢，老兄？”盖茨比说，“是你自己要求进城来的。”

一阵沉默。电话簿从钉子上滑落下来，“啪”的一声掉到地上，于是乔丹低声说：“对不起。”但是这一次谁也没笑。

“我来捡。”我抢着说。

“我捡起来了。”盖茨比认真地看了看断开的绳子，然后表示关心地“哼”了一声，把电话簿往椅子上一扔。

“那是你的口头禅吗？”汤姆很不客气地说。

“什么？”

“动不动‘老兄老兄’的。你是从哪里学来的？”

“你听着，汤姆，”黛西说，一面从镜子前面转过身来，“如果你搞人身攻击，我就一分钟也不待在这里。打个电话要点冰块来做薄荷酒。”

汤姆拿起话筒，此时，那压缩的热空气突然爆发出响声，我们听到门德尔松48的《婚礼进行曲》华美庄严的旋律从底下的舞厅里传上来。

“想想看竟然还有人在这样的大热天结婚！”乔丹有气无力地喊道。

“还是有的——我就是在6月中旬结婚的，”黛西回忆道，“6月的路易斯维尔！有个人晕倒了。晕倒的是谁，汤姆？”

“毕洛克西。”他简慢地答道。

“一个叫‘毕洛克西’的人。‘木头人’毕洛克西，他是做盒子的——这是事实——他又是田纳西州毕洛克西49市的人。”

“他们把他抬到我家，”乔丹补充说，“因为我们住的地方和教堂隔着两家的距离。他一住就待了三个星期，直到爸爸叫他离开。他走后第二天，爸爸就死了。”过了一会儿，她又加了一句话，“这两件事之间并没有什么联系。”

“我过去也认识一个孟菲斯50人叫比尔·毕洛克西。”我说。

“那是他的堂兄。他走以前，我搞清楚了他的整个家史。他送了我一根铝质的打高尔夫球轻击棒，直到今天我还在用。”

婚礼开始后音乐就停了，这时，一阵很长的欢呼声从窗口飘了进来，接着又是一阵阵“好啊——好啊——”的叫喊声，最后，响起爵士乐的声音，舞会开始了。

“我们都老了，”黛西说，“如果还年轻的话，我们就会起身跳舞了。”

“别忘了毕洛克西。”乔丹提醒她，“你是在哪儿认识他的，汤姆？”

“毕洛克西？”他聚精会神想了一会，“我并不认识他。他是黛西的朋友。”

“才不是哩，”黛西否认道，“我在那以前从来没见过他。他是坐你包的专车来的。”

“可是他说他认识你。他说他是在路易斯维尔长大的。阿莎·伯德在最后一分钟把他带来，问我们有没有位子给他坐。”

乔丹笑了笑。

“他多半是一路免费搭车回家。他告诉我他是你们在耶鲁大学上学时的班长。”

汤姆和我面面相觑。

“毕洛克西？”

“首先，我们那时压根儿就没有班长……”

盖茨比的脚不耐烦地连敲了几声，汤姆立刻瞧了他一眼。

“顺便问一下，盖茨比先生，我听说你是牛津的毕业生。”

“并不完全是。”

“哦，是的，我听说你读过牛津。”

“是的，我上过那儿。”

停顿了一会儿。然后是汤姆的充满怀疑和侮辱的声音：“你上牛津的时候正好是毕洛克西去纽黑文的时间吧。”

又停顿了一会。一个服务生敲门，端着压碎了的薄荷叶和冰块走进来，但是他的一声“谢谢”和轻轻的关门声也没打破沉默。这个重要的细节终于要澄清了。

“我跟你说过了我上过那儿。”盖茨比说。

“我听见了，可是我想知道在什么时候。”

“是在1919年，我只在那里待了五个月。这就是为什么我不能自称是牛津毕业生的原因。”

汤姆瞥了大家一眼，看看我们脸上是否也表现出同他一样的怀疑。但是我们都在望着盖茨比。

“那是停战以后他们为一些军官提供的机会，”他继续往下说，“我们可以上英国或者法国的任何一所大学。”

我真想起身过去拍拍他的肩膀。我又一次对他充满了彻底的信任，就像以前一样。

黛西站了起来，微微一笑，走到桌子跟前。

“打开威士忌，汤姆，”她命令道，“我给你调一杯薄荷酒。然后你就不会尽犯傻了……瞧这些薄荷叶子！”

“等一下，”汤姆厉声喝道，“我还要问盖茨比先生一个问题。”

“请问吧。”盖茨比彬彬有礼地说。

“你究竟想在我家里搬弄什么样的是非？”

他们终于把话挑明了，这正中盖茨比的下怀。

“不是他在搬弄是非，”黛西绝望地看看这个，又看看那个，“是你在搬弄是非。请你稍微克制一下自己吧。”

“克制自己！”汤姆难以置信地重复道，“我想最流行的怪事大概就是装聋作哑，任由一个不知从什么地方钻出来的阿猫阿狗跟你老婆调情。哼，如果这就是你们打的主意，你可以把我除外……这年头人们开始对家庭生活和家庭制度嗤之以鼻，再下一步他们就该抛弃一切，在黑人和白人之间通婚了。”

他满口胡言乱语，脸涨得通红，俨然自己孤身一人在守卫着文明的最后一道屏障。

“我们这里可都是白人。”乔丹咕哝着说。

“我知道我不受欢迎。我不举行大型的晚会。看来你非得把自己的家搞成猪圈才能交朋友——在这个现代社会里。”

尽管我和大家一样感到很气愤，但是只要他一张口，我就忍不住想笑。一个放荡不羁的花花公子竟然摇身一变就成了道貌岸然的卫道士。

“我也有话要对你说，老兄……”盖茨比开口说。但是黛西猜到了他的目的。

“请你不要说！”她无助地打断了他的话，“我们都回家吧。我们为什么不回家呢？”

“这是个好主意。”我站了起来，“走吧，汤姆。没有人想喝酒。”

“我想知道盖茨比先生有什么话要跟我讲。”

“你妻子不爱你，”盖茨比说，“她从来没有爱过你。她爱的是我。”

“你一定是疯了！”汤姆脱口而出。

盖茨比猛地跳了起来，异常激动。

“她从来没有爱过你，你听见了吗？”他喊道，“她嫁给你，只不过是因为当时我穷，她等我等得不耐烦了。那是一个严重的错误，但是她心里除了我从来没有爱过别人！”

这时乔丹和我都想走，但是汤姆和盖茨比两人较着劲，坚持硬要我们留下——好像两人都没有什么不可告人的事，也好像跟他们一起感受一下他们的感情也是一种特殊的荣幸。

“坐下，黛西，”汤姆佯装一种父辈的口吻，可是并不成功，“这是怎么一回事？我想知道事情的来龙去脉。”

“我已经告诉过你是怎么回事了，”盖茨比说，“已经五年了——只是你不知道罢了。”

汤姆猛地转过身去看黛西。

“你和这家伙来往五年了？”

“没有来往，”盖茨比说，“不，我们见不了面。可是我们俩在那整个期间都深爱着对方，老兄，而你却不知道。我以前有时会笑，”——不过他眼中并无笑意，“想到你对此事一无所知。”

“哦——就这些呀。”汤姆像牧师一样把他的粗壮的手指轻轻一拍合拢在一起，然后往椅子上一靠。“你发疯了！”他破口大骂，“我没法说五年前发生的事，因为当时我还不认识黛西——可是我真他妈的想不通你是怎么接近她的，除非你是杂货店送货的，送食品到她家后门。至于你其余的话都是他妈的扯淡。黛西跟我结婚时她是爱我的，现在她还是爱我。”

“不对。”盖茨比摇摇头说。

“不管你怎么说，她确实爱我。问题是她有时胡思乱想，做一些她自己也不清楚的事情。”他明察秋毫地点点头，“更重要的是，我也爱黛西；偶尔我也有胡闹的时候，逢场作戏，做些傻事，不过我总是回头，而且我心里始终是爱她的。”

“你真叫人恶心，”黛西说。她转向我，声音降低了八度，使整个屋子充满了她激愤的嘲笑声：“你知道我们为什么离开芝加哥吗？我真奇怪他们竟然没有告诉你他干的那点荒唐事。”

盖茨比走过来站在她身边。

“黛西，那一切都结束了，”他认真地说，“一切都无关紧要了。只要告诉他实情——告诉他你从来没爱过他——过去的一切都一笔勾销了。”

她茫然地看着他。“是啊——我怎么会爱他——这怎么可能呢？”

“你从来没有爱过他。”

她迟疑不决，她那求助的目光落到了乔丹和我的身上，好像她终于认识到她正在做什么事情——好像她一直并没想过做任何事，但是现在事情已经做了，为时已晚。

“我从来没爱过他。”她说道，但看得出很勉强。

“在夏威夷凯皮奥兰尼时也没爱过吗？”汤姆突然质问道。

“没有。”

从底下的舞厅里，传来闷声闷气、令人窒息的曲子，并伴随着滚滚热浪。

“那天我担心你打湿鞋子，把你从‘潘趣酒碗’号游艇上抱下来的时候，你也不爱我吗？”他沙哑的声音流露着柔情，“黛西？”

“请别说了。”她的声音仍是冷淡的，但已经没有了怨恨。她看看盖茨比。“唉，杰伊。”她说，可是她想点支烟时手却在发抖。突然，她把香烟和点着的火柴往地毯上一扔。

“啊，你的要求太过分了！”她对盖茨比喊道，“我现在爱你——难道这还不够吗？过去的事我无法挽回。”她很无助地呜咽起来。“我确实曾经爱过他——但是我也爱过你啊。”

盖茨比的眼睛睁开一下又闭上。

“你也爱过我？”他重复说。

“连这个也是谎话，”汤姆蛮横地说，“她根本不知道你还活着。要知道，黛西和我之间有许多事你永远也不会知道，我们两个永远也不会忘记。”

这番话深深地刺痛了盖茨比的心。

“我要和黛西单独谈谈，”他坚持说，“她现在太激动了……”“单独跟你谈，我也不能说我从来没爱过汤姆，”她用悲伤的声调吐露说，“那么说不是真心话。”

“当然不是真话。”汤姆附和道。

她转向她丈夫。“好像你还在乎似的。”她说。

“当然在乎啦。从现在开始我要更好地照顾你。”

“你还不明白，”盖茨比有点慌张地说，“你没有机会再照顾她了。”

“我没有机会了？”汤姆睁大了眼睛，放声大笑。他现在能够控制自己了。“为什么？”

“黛西要离开你了。”

“胡说八道。”

“不过，我的确要离开你。”她显然很费了很大的劲才说出来。

“她不会离开我的！”汤姆突然劈头盖脸地对盖茨比骂起来，“反正决不会为了一个江湖骗子离开我，一个连结婚戒指都要到别处去偷来的江湖骗子。”

“这么说我可受不了！”黛西大声喊道，“啊呀，我们还是走吧。”

“你到底是什么东西？”汤姆一下子爆发了，“你是跟迈尔·沃尔夫山姆那伙人混在一起的，这一点我碰巧知道，我对你的事儿已经做了一点小调查——明天我还要进一步调查下去。”

“悉听尊便，老兄。”盖茨比镇定地说。

“我早已发现你那些‘药房’是怎么回事。”他转过身来对着我们迅速地说，“他和那个叫迈尔·沃尔夫山姆的家伙在这里和芝加哥买下了许多小街上的药店，不用处方就把酒精卖给人家。这就是他耍的许多小把戏中的一个。我头一回看见他就认定他是个私酒贩子，我猜的还差不离哩。”

“那又怎么样呢？”盖茨比客气地说，“你的朋友瓦尔特·蔡斯跟我们合伙并不觉得丢人嘛。”

“你们还把他坑了，不是吗？是你们让他在新泽西州的监狱里待了一个月。天啊！你应当听听瓦尔特数落你的那些话。”

“他找上我们的时候是个穷光蛋。他很高兴能赚上一笔，老兄。”

“别叫我‘老兄’！”汤姆喊道。盖茨比没吭声，“瓦尔特本来还可以告你违法赌博的，但是沃尔夫山姆一恐吓，他便闭上了嘴。”

那种陌生而又似曾相识的神情又一次出现在盖茨比的脸上。

“那个开药店的事儿不过是小意思，”汤姆慢慢地接着说，“但是你们现在又在搞些什么名堂，瓦尔特不敢告诉我。”

我瞥了黛西一眼，她吓坏了，目瞪口呆地看看盖茨比，又看看她丈夫，再看看乔丹——她似乎又开始在她的下巴尖上顶着什么看不见可是却吸引人的东西，然后我又转过头去看盖茨比——立刻被他脸上的表情吓了一大跳。他看上去好像刚“杀了一个人”似的——我说这话可与他花园里的那些诽谤中伤毫不相干。可是一刹那间，他脸上的表情恰恰可以用那种荒唐的字眼来描述。

这种表情很快就消失了，他开始激动地对黛西说话，矢口否认一切，竭力维护自己的声誉，驳斥那些还没有向他提出控告的罪行。但是他说得越多，她就越显得疏远，于是他只好不说了，唯有那破灭的梦想随着下午的流逝在继续挣扎，拼命想触摸到那不再摸得着的东西，朝着屋子那边那个此时无声无息的声音痛苦地但并不绝望地挣扎着。

那个声音再次央求大家离开。

“求求你，汤姆！我再也受不了这一切了。”

她惶恐的眼睛显露出，不管她曾经有过什么样的意愿，有过什么样的勇气，此刻已经都消失殆尽了。

“你们两人动身回家吧，黛西，”汤姆说，“坐盖茨比先生的车走。”

她看着汤姆，惊慌失措，但他故意装作宽宏大量以示侮蔑，坚持要她跟盖茨比一起走。

“放心走吧。他不会再麻烦你的。我想他该意识到他那自以为是的小小的调情已经结束了。”

他们俩走了，一句话也没说，飘忽而去，来无影去无踪，仿佛一对孤立无助的鬼影一般，甚至我们还没来得及表示怜悯。

过了一会儿，汤姆站起身来，开始用毛巾把那瓶未开启的威士忌重新包起来。

“来点儿这玩意吗？乔丹？……尼克？”

我没搭腔。

“尼克？”他又问了一声。

“什么？”

“来点儿吗？”

“不要……我刚刚想起来今天是我的生日。”

我三十岁了。新的十年在我面前展现，那是一条布满荆棘、凶多吉少的人生道路。

等到我们跟汤姆坐上小轿车动身回长岛时，已经是晚上七点钟了。汤姆一路上说个不停，得意洋洋，笑声起伏，但他的声音对乔丹和我来说显得非常遥远，仿佛是人行道上嘈杂的人声和头顶上高架铁路轰隆隆的车声一样。人类的同情心是有限度的，所以我们也乐于让他们令人悲哀的争执随着身后掠去的城市灯火一道逐渐消失。三十岁——等待着我的可能是十年的孤独，可交往的单身汉愈发减少，热情逐渐冷却，头发逐渐稀疏。但我身边还有乔丹，她和黛西不同，少年老成，不会把那些早已遗忘的旧梦一年又一年地藏在心里。我们驶过漆黑的铁桥时，她那疲倦的脸懒懒地靠在我的肩上，她的手紧紧握住我的手，驱散了三十岁生日给我带来的恐惧感。

于是我们在渐渐凉爽起来的暮色中向死亡驶去。

那个年轻的希腊人米凯里斯，在灰堆附近开了一家小咖啡馆，他是后来案件调查时的主要见证人。那个下午实在太热，他一觉睡到五点以后才起来，溜达到了车行，发现乔治·威尔逊在他的办公室里病倒了——病得很重，脸色和他本人苍白的头发一样煞白，浑身都在发抖。米凯里斯劝他上床休息，但威尔逊不肯，说那样的话就要错过不少生意。这位邻居正在劝说他的时候，楼上忽然大吵大闹起来。

“我把我老婆锁在楼上了，”威尔逊平静地解释说，“让她在那儿一直待到后天，然后我们就搬走。”

米凯里斯非常惊讶。他们做了四年邻居，威尔逊从来不像是一个能说出这种话来的人。通常她总是一个软弱无力的人：不干活的时候，他就坐在门口的凳子上，傻傻地望着路上过往的行人和车辆。不论谁跟他说话，他都会和和气气、无精打采地笑笑。他对他老婆言听计从，自己没有一点主张。

因此，米凯里斯很自然地想打听到底发生了什么事，但威尔逊一个字也不肯吐露——相反，他却用古怪的、怀疑的目光打量起这位客人来，并且盘问他某些日子某些时间在干什么。正当米凯里斯被问得感到不自在的时候，有几个工人从车行门口经过，朝他的餐馆走去，他就乘机脱了身，打算过一会再回来。但是他并没有再来。他想他大概忘了，并没别的缘故。7点刚过，他再一次走到外面时，才想起了这番谈话，因为他听见威尔逊太太在楼下车行里正破口大骂。

“打我吧！”他听见她的嚷嚷声，“把我按在地上打我吧，你这个肮脏的胆小鬼！”

过了一会儿，她就冲到了外面的暮色里，边挥手边叫喊——他还没来得及离开自家门口，惨祸就已经发生了。

那辆“肇事车”——报纸上是这么称呼的——压根就没停。车子从昏暗的暮色中突然出现，闯祸后稍稍迟疑了一会儿，接着在前面转个弯就不见了。马弗罗·米凯里斯连车子的颜色都没看清——他对第一个警察说车子是浅绿色的。另一辆车，开往纽约的那一辆，开到一百码以外停了下来，司机急忙跑回事发地点，梅特尔·威尔逊惨死在马路中间，她双膝跪在地上，发黑的浓血和尘土混在了一起。

米凯里斯和这位司机最先赶到她身旁，但是等他们撕开她那被汗水浸透的衬衣时，发现她左边的乳房已经松垮垮地耷拉着，因此也就用不着再去听那下面的心跳了。她的嘴巴张得老大，嘴角有一点撕破，好像她在释放那长期存储在身体里的旺盛精力时，突然哽住了喉咙。

我们离事发地点还有一段距离时，就看见了三四辆汽车和围观的人群。

“出车祸了！”汤姆说，“这下好了。威尔逊总算有点生意了。”

他放慢了车速，但是并没打算停车，直至我们离得很近了，看到聚集在车行门口的那些人闭口不言、神情严肃，他才不由自主地把车刹住。

“我们去看一眼吧，”他狐疑地说，“看一眼就走。”

这时，我听到车行里不断传出来的一阵阵空洞的哀嚎声，我们下了车走向车行门口时，才听出其中一遍又一遍的、上气不接下气地喊出的“哦，我的上帝”几个字。

“这儿出了什么大乱子了。”汤姆激动地说。

他踮起脚从一群围观的人头顶上往车行里望去，车行里只有一盏昏黄的灯，摇摇晃晃地悬挂在头顶上方的铁丝罩里。随后他吼了一声，两只强有力的手臂猛然向前一推，就挤进了人群。

被扒开的圈子又合上了，同时传出一阵咕咕哝哝的劝告声。有一两分钟我什么也看不见。后来新到的人又挤乱了原来的圈子，突然乔丹和我被挤到里面去了。

梅特尔·威尔逊的尸体裹在一条毯子里，外面又包了一条毯子，仿佛在这炎热的夜晚她还怕冷似的。尸体陈放在墙边一张工作台上，汤姆背对着我们正低头看着，一动也不动。在他旁边站着一名摩托车警察，正满头大汗地往小本子上记着名字，还不时地涂涂改改。

起初我找不到那在空空的车行里回荡着的高分贝的哭喊声来自何处——后来我才看见威尔逊站在他办公室高高的门槛上，身体前后晃动着，双手紧紧地抓着门框。有一个人在低声跟他说话，不时地想把一只手搭在他的肩上，但威尔逊既听不到也看不见。他的目光从那盏摇曳的灯光慢慢地下移到墙边那张停着尸体的桌子上，忽而又猛地转回到那盏灯上，同时他不停地发出他那高亢的、可怕的呼号：“哦，我的天哪！哦，我的天哪！哦，天……哪！哦，我的天……哪！”

过了一会儿，汤姆猛地抬起头来，用呆滞的目光扫视了一圈车行，然后对警察语无伦次地说了些什么。

“马弗——”警察在说，“奥——”

“不对，罗——”那人更正说，“马——弗——罗——”

“你听我说！”汤姆恶狠狠地低声说。

“罗——”警察说，“奥”。

“格——”

“格——”汤姆的宽大的手掌重重地落在他的肩膀上时，他抬起头来，“你想干什么，伙计？”

“出了什么事？——这就是我想要知道的。”

“一辆汽车撞了她，当场死亡。”

“当场死亡。”汤姆重复道，两眼发直。

“她冲到了马路中间。那个狗娘养的连车都没停。”

“当时有两辆车，”米凯里斯说，“一来，一去，明白吗？”

“往什么方向开？”警察机警地询问。

“两辆车开往不同的方向。喏，她呢，”他的手朝着毯子举起来，但半路上停了下来，放回到身边，“她冲到外面的马路上，纽约来的那辆车迎面撞上了她，车子的时速约有三四十英里。”

“这地方叫什么名字？”警察问道。

“没有名字。”

一个脸色苍白、穿得体面的黑人走上前来。

“那是一辆黄色的车，”他说，“大型的黄色汽车，新的。”

“看到车祸经过了吗？”警察问。

“没有，但是那辆车子在路上从我旁边开过，速度不止四十英里，有五六十英里。”

“到这里来，让我们记下你的名字。让开点。我要记下他的名字。”

这段谈话一定有几句传到了站在办公室门口摇晃的威尔逊耳朵里，因为忽然在他痛心的哀嚎中出现了新的内容：“你不用告诉我那是辆什么车子！我知道是什么车子！”

我注视着汤姆，看见他肩膀后面那团肌肉在上衣下面绷得紧紧的。他快步走过去，站在威尔逊的面前，一把抓住他的上臂。

“你一定要振作起来。”他用粗狂的声音安慰道。

威尔逊的眼光落到了汤姆身上。他踮着脚尖想站起来，却差点跪倒在地上，要不是汤姆扶住他的话。

“你听我说，”汤姆说，一面轻轻地摇着他，“我刚刚到这里，从纽约过来的。正准备把我们谈过的那辆小轿车给你送过来。今天下午我开的那辆车子不是我的——你听见了吗？后来我整个下午都没看到它。”

只有那个黑人和我离他们最近，可以听到他说的话，但那个警察也听出他声调里有问题，于是用凶狠的目光向这边扫过来。

“怎么回事？”他质问道。

“我是他的朋友。”汤姆转过头来，双手仍紧紧地抓住威尔逊的身体，“他说他认识那辆肇事的车子……是一辆黄色的车子。”

警察隐隐感到事情有些蹊跷，怀疑地看着汤姆。

“那么你的车子是什么颜色的？”

“是一辆蓝色的车子，一辆小轿车。”

“我们是刚从纽约来的。”我说。

有位一直跟在我们后面不远处开车的人证实了这一点，于是警察转过身去了。

“现在，让我再把那名字核对一下……”

汤姆把威尔逊像玩偶一样提起来，提到办公室里，放在一把椅子上，自己又回来。

“请哪位过来陪他坐会。”他用发号施令的口吻说。他张望着，站得最近的两个人彼此对视一眼，很不情愿地走进那间屋子。然后汤姆在他们身后关上了门，跨下仅有一级的台阶，他的眼睛躲开那张桌子。他走过我的身边时低声说：“我们走吧。”

在众人的注视下，汤姆用他那充满力量的手臂左冲右突，为我们开路，我们挤出了越聚越多的人群，迎面碰上一位手提药箱、匆匆而来的医生，还是半个小时以前人们抱着一线希望请过来的。

汤姆把车开得很慢，直到拐过那个弯之后，他的脚才重重地踩了一下油门，于是小轿车就在黑夜里飞驰而去。过了一会儿，我听见一阵低沉的哭泣声，接着看到他泪流满面。

“该死的懦夫！”他哭泣着说，“他连车子都没停。”

穿过黑黢黢的、沙沙作响的树林，布坎南家的房子突然出现在我们面前。汤姆在门廊边把车停下，抬头看了看二楼，那里有两扇窗户在蔓藤中间透着通亮的灯光。

“黛西到家了。”他说，我们下车时，他瞟了我一眼，微微地皱了皱眉头。

“我应当在西半岛让你下车的，尼克。今天晚上我们没有什么事可做了。”

他的身上发生了某种变化，他说起话来很严肃，而且很果断。当我们穿过铺满月光的石子路往门廊走时，他干脆利落地把眼前的情况解决了。

“我打个电话叫一辆出租车来送你回家。你等车的时候，你和乔丹最好到厨房去，让他们给你们弄点晚餐——如果你们想吃的话。”他推开了大门，“进来。”

“不用了，谢谢。但是要麻烦你为我叫辆出租车来，我在外面等。”

乔丹伸出手挽住了我的胳膊。

“你进来不好吗，尼克？”

“不啦，谢谢。”

我心里觉得有点不舒服，我想一个人单独待一会儿，但乔丹又停留了一会儿。

“现在才九点半。”她说。

我说什么也不肯进去了。一整天跟他们几个人在一起，我受够了，突然间觉得和乔丹也待够了。她一定在我的表情中多少发觉了一点端倪，因为她猛地一转身，跑上门廊的台阶，进屋去了。我两手抱着头坐了几分钟，直到我听见屋子里有人打电话，又听见男管家的声音在叫出租车。于是我就沿着车道慢慢从房子前走开，计划到大门口去等车。

我还没走出二十码远，就听见有人喊我的名字，接着就看见盖茨比从两个灌木丛中间走出来，来到小路上。我当时一定是有些神思恍惚，因为我脑子里除了他那套在月光下发亮的粉红色衣服之外，什么也想不起来。

“你在这儿做什么？”我问道。

“就在这儿站一站，老兄。”

不知为什么，他看上去像是想做什么可耻的事情。说不定他准备马上就去抢劫这一家哪！这时要是我看到许多邪恶的面孔，什么“沃尔夫山姆之流”的面孔，躲在他背后黑黝黝的灌木丛中，我也不会感到吃惊的。

“你在路上看到那场车祸了吗？”他过了一会问道。

“看到了。”

他犹豫了一下。

“她撞死了吗？”

“死了。”

“我当时就料到了。我对黛西也是这么说的。各种打击一起来，反倒好些。她表现得挺坚强。”

他这样说，好像黛西的反应是唯一要紧的事情。

“我是从一条小路开回西半岛去，”他接着说，“把车子停在了我的车库里。我想没有人看到过我们，当然我也无法确定这一点。”

到这时我已经十分讨厌他，因此我觉得没有必要告诉他：他想错了。

“那个女人是谁？”他问道。

“她姓威尔逊。她丈夫是那家车行的老板。这事到底是怎么发生的？”

“呃，我想把方向盘扳过来的……”他突然打住，我一下子猜到了事故的真相。

“是黛西在开车吗？”

“是的，”他停了片刻才说，“但是当然我要说是我在开车。事情是这样的：我们离开纽约的时候，她神经非常紧张，她以为开车可以使她平静下来——我们正要避开对面驶过来的一辆车的时候，那个女人突然向我们冲过来。刹那间一切就发生了，但我觉得她像是想要跟我们说什么，以为我们是她的熟人。嗯，黛西先是把车子从那个女人那边闪开，朝着另一辆车冲去，接着她又惊慌失措地转了回去。我的手一握到方向盘，就感到了剧烈的震动——一定是当场把她撞死的。”

“把她撞得很惨……”

“别跟我说这个，老兄。”他退缩起来，“总而言之，黛西拼命踩油门。我想让她停下来，但她停不了，我只好拉上了紧急刹车。这时她跌倒在我的怀里，我就接过来继续向前开。”

“她明天就会好的，”他过了一会儿又说，“我要在这儿等着，看他会不会因为今天下午的不愉快找她麻烦。她把自己锁在自己房间里了，如果他敢乱来的话，她就会把灯拉灭后再拉亮。”

“他不会碰她的，”我说，“他现在想的不是她。”

“我信不过他，老兄。”

“你打算在这里等多久？”

“整个晚上，如果有必要的话。反正，等到他们都去睡觉。”

我忽然有了一个新的看法。假设汤姆知道了开车的是黛西，结果会怎样呢？或许他会认为事出有因——他也许会乱猜一气的。我看了看那座房子。楼下有两三扇窗户还亮着灯，二楼黛西的屋子里透出粉红色的柔光。

“你在这儿等一下，”我说，“我去看看有没有什么动静。”

我沿着草坪的边缘往回走，蹑手蹑脚地穿过石子路，踮起脚尖上了走廊的台阶。客厅的窗帘开着，屋子里空无一人。我穿过三个月以前那个六月的晚上我们吃过晚饭的阳台，来到了一片长方形的灯光前面，我猜那是餐厅的窗户。遮帘拉上了，不过我在窗台上找到了一个缝隙。

黛西和汤姆在厨房的餐桌边面对面坐着，两人中间放着一盘冷炸鸡和两瓶啤酒。他正在隔着桌子聚精会神地跟她说话，而且认真地把他的手放在她的手上。她不时抬起头来看看他，表示赞同地点点头。

他们并不高兴，两人谁也没动炸鸡和啤酒——可是他们并不难过。这幅画面充满了一种自然而然的亲密融洽的气氛，任何人看了都会说他们俩正在一起计划着什么。

当我小心翼翼地走下门廊的时候，听见我的出租车正慢慢地沿着漆黑的道路向往这里开过来。盖茨比还在我刚才离开他的车道那里等着我。

“那里一切都安静吗？”他焦急地问。

“是的，很安静。”我迟疑了一下，“你最好也回家去睡觉吧。”

他摇了摇头。

“我要在这里一直等到黛西上床睡觉。晚安，老兄。”

他把双手插在上衣口袋里，急切地转过身去，牢牢地盯着那座房子，好像我的在场妨碍了他神圣的守望。于是我离开了，把他一个人留在月光里——空守着。





第八章


整夜我无法入眠。向船只发出警报的雾笛在海湾上空没完没了地呜呜作响，我好像生病了一样躺在床上翻来覆去，游离于离奇古怪的现实和可怕的噩梦之间。临近拂晓的时候，我听见一辆出租车开上盖茨比的汽车道，我立即从床上跳下来穿上衣服——我觉得我有话要跟他讲，有事情要提醒他，等到早晨恐怕就来不及了。

我穿过他的草坪，看见他家的大门仍然大开着，他正在大厅里靠着一张桌子站着，由于沮丧或者困倦而显得疲惫不堪。

“什么事情也没有发生，”他有气无力地说，“我一直等到凌晨四点钟左右，她走到窗门，待了一会儿，就把灯熄灭了。”

那天夜里，我们俩穿越他的那些大房间四下里寻找香烟的时候，他的别墅对于我来说似乎显得从来没有如此宽敞。我们把帐篷布似的厚门帘推到一边，摸着似乎没有边际的、漆黑一片的墙壁徐徐前行，寻找着电灯的开关——有一次我被一架幽灵似的钢琴绊了一脚，轰隆一声摔倒在键盘上。到处都是不知道从哪里来的那么多的灰尘，所有的房间里都散发着一种发霉的味道，似乎已经有很多日子没有通风换气了。我在一张不大熟悉的桌子上找到了一个烟盒，里面还剩下两根变了味的、干瘪的香烟。我们把客厅里的落地窗打开，坐下来对着外面漆黑的夜色抽起烟来。

“你应当离开这里，”我说，“他们肯定会追查你的车子的。”

“现在离开，老兄？”

“到大西洋城51去待上一个星期，或是往北到蒙特利尔52去。”

他不愿意考虑。在他知道黛西下一步准备怎么做之前，他是绝不可能离开黛西的。他还在抓着最后的一线希望不放，我也不忍劝他撒手。

就是这天晚上，他告诉了我他年轻的时候跟丹·科迪之间发生的传奇故事，因为“杰伊·盖茨比”已经像玻璃一样被汤姆恶狠狠的敌意砸了个粉碎，那出漫长的秘密荒诞剧也已经谢幕了。我想他现在会毫无保留地承认一切，但他只想说黛西的事。

她是他所认识的第一个“名门闺秀”。以前他也曾经以各种没有透露的身份接触过不少这样的名门淑女，但每次总有一层无形的藩篱横在中间。他觉得她最符合他的心意。他到她家里去，起先和泰勒营的其他军官一起去，后来就单独前往。她的家使他惊讶不已——他从来没有走进过这么漂亮的住宅，其所以有一种屏气息声的紧张气氛还是因为黛西住在那里——但是这房子对于她来说，就像他待在军营的帐篷里那样习以为常，不足为奇。这座房子带有一种引人入胜的神秘感，总使人浮想联翩：仿佛暗示楼上的卧室比其他卧室更漂亮、更凉爽，暗示走廊里到处都是层出不穷的欢乐且精彩的活动，还有许多风流韵事——不是那种发了霉的、用熏衣草保存起来的，而是鲜活的，有血有肉的浪漫史，会使人联想到当年最流行的汽车，联想到鲜花还没凋谢的舞会。更令他激动不已的是，曾经有很多男子倾心于黛西——这更加提高了她在他眼中的价值。他能感觉到他们存在于这所房子的每个角落里，空气中弥漫着他们仍在颤动的感情的回声和他们的身影。

不过他明白他之所以能出入黛西家里纯粹是出于偶然，不管他作为杰伊·盖茨比会有怎样的锦绣前程，目前他只是一个默默无闻、一文不名的青年人，而且那套穿在他身上无形中为他做了掩护的军装随时都可能从他肩头滑落。因此，他充分地利用他的时间，占有他所能得到的东西，贪婪而又不择手段地——终于在一个静寂的十月的夜晚，他占有了黛西，占有了她的身体，因为他知道并没有真正的权利去摸她的手。

他也许应该鄙视自己，因为无疑他是用欺骗的手段占有了她。我不是说他利用了他那虚幻的百万家产。但是他有意给黛西造成一种安全感，让她相信他和她属于同一个社会阶层——并且相信他完全有能力照料她。实际上，他并没有这种能力——他背后没有富有的家庭支撑着他，而且只要无情的政府一声令下，他随时都可以被派到世界上任何地方去。

但是他并没有鄙视自己，事情的结果也出乎他的意料。他起初很可能只打算玩玩而已，然后一走了之——但是现在他发现他已经把自己投身于追求一种理想。他知道黛西与众不同，但是他并没认识到一位“名门淑女”能够这样的与众不同。她立刻消失在她那豪华的住宅里，回到她那富有充实的生活，留下盖茨比一个人——一无所有。他觉得他自己已经和她结婚了，如此而已。

两天之后，他们俩再次见面时，盖茨比显得十分激动，似乎是他受骗了。她家的阳台沐浴在灿烂的星光里。她转身让他吻她那张奇妙、可爱的嘴时，时尚的柳条长靠椅发出吱吱嘎嘎的响声，她着凉了，这使她的声音听起来比平时更沙哑，更动人。盖茨比深切地体会到财富怎样帮助人们拥有和保存青春与神秘，体会到各式各样的服装怎样使人保持清新靓丽，体会到财富怎样使黛西像白银一样熠熠发光，安然高居于穷苦人激烈的生存斗争之上。

“我无法向你描述当我发现自己爱上了她以后感到多么惊讶，老兄。有一阵子我甚至希望她把我甩了，但是她没有，因为她也爱我。她以为我懂得很多，因为我知道很多她不知道的事情……唉，我就是那样，把雄心壮志抛到一边，每一分钟都在爱河里越陷越深，忽然之间我对什么都不在乎了。如果我能够告诉她我打算去做些什么，并从中得到更大的快乐，那么又何必去做什么大事呢？”

在他动身前往海外之前的最后一个下午，他把黛西搂在怀里静静地坐了很长的时间。那是一个寒冷的秋日，屋子里生了火，她的脸颊映得通红。黛西不时活动一下，他的手臂也跟着轻轻地变换一下姿势，有一次他还吻了吻她那乌黑油亮的头发。那天下午他们安静地坐了好一会儿，好像为了在他们记忆中留下一个深刻的印迹，也为明天即将开始的漫长的离别做好准备。她默默地用嘴唇拂过他上衣的肩头，而他温柔地摩挲着她的指间，仿佛她已经睡着了。在他们相爱的那一个月里，他们还从来没有这么亲密过，也从来没有这样深深地心灵相通。

他在战争中表现十分出色。上前线之前他已是一名上尉，阿尔贡战役之后他晋升为少校，指挥师里的机枪部队。停战以后，他迫不及待地要求回国，但是由于某些复杂的原因或者是误会，他却被送到了牛津。这时他很着急——因为黛西的信里流露出既紧张又绝望的情绪。她不明白他为什么不能回来。她正承受着外界的压力，因此她需要见他，需要感到有他在她身边，需要他安慰她，对她说她所做的一切完全正确。

毕竟黛西当时还很年轻，在她那个虚饰的世界洋溢着兰花的芬芳，充满社交的欢乐和交响乐团的愉悦——正是那些乐团定下了当年的基调，用新的曲调总结人生的哀愁和启示。萨克斯管通宵演奏着《比尔街爵士乐》忧郁的曲调，同时上百双金色银色的舞鞋跳动着，扬起闪亮的灰尘。每天晚茶时分，总有一些房间由于这种低沉而甜蜜的狂热旋律而不停地震颤，而一张张娇艳的脸庞飘来飘去，好像是被哀怨的萨克斯管吹落了一地的玫瑰花瓣。

在这个朦胧的大千世界里，随着社交季节的开始，黛西又开始活跃了。忽然间她每天又有五六次约会，和五六个男人相亲，直到拂晓时分才昏昏沉沉地入睡，晚礼服就扔在她床边的地板上，上面的珠子和薄纱跟凋零的兰花纠缠在一起。在这整个期间，她内心深处渴望做出一个决定。她想要现在就解决自己的终身大事，刻不容缓——而且这个决定必须由近在眼前的某种外力来促成——爱情也好，金钱也罢，总之要实实在在地唾手可得的东西。

那种外力在那年的春天过去了一半的时候，随着汤姆·布坎南的到来而形成了，他的身材和地位都很有分量，因此黛西也觉得很有面子。毫无疑问，她有过一番思想斗争，后来就如释重负。收到黛西寄来的信时，盖茨比还在牛津。

这时长岛上已是破晓时分，我们走过去把楼下其余的窗子也都打开，让屋子里充满渐渐由银白转成金黄的光线。一棵树的影子突兀地投在露水上，同时幽灵般的鸟儿在青绿色的树叶中鸣唱。空气中有一种缓慢的、令人心旷神怡的动静，还说不上是风，预示着凉爽宜人的好天气。

“我相信她从来没爱过他，”盖茨比从一扇窗子前转过身来，用挑战的眼神看着我，“你必须记住，老兄，她今天下午非常激动。他跟她讲那些话的方式把她吓坏了——他把我说成是一个一文不值的骗子，结果她根本不知道自己在说些什么。”

他闷闷不乐地坐了下来。

“当然，在他们刚结婚的时候，她可能爱过他一阵子——即便是在那时，她也是爱我更多一些，你明白吗？”

忽然间他冒出了一句很奇怪的话。

“不管怎样，”他说，“这只是个人的事。”

你还能怎么理解这句话呢，只有把它猜测为他对这件事的态度强烈到无以复加的地步。

汤姆和黛西还在度蜜月的时候，盖茨比从法国回来了。他悲痛欲绝，不由自主地用他最后一点津贴到路易斯维尔去了一趟。他在那里待了一个星期，走遍了他俩当年在十一月的夜晚并肩漫步过的街道，重游了他们当年开着她那辆白色汽车去过的那些偏僻地方。正如在他的眼里，黛西家的房子总是比别的房子更加神秘、欢乐，尽管她已经离开这里，他仍觉得这座城市本身充满了一种伤感的美。

他离开的时候觉得，如果他更努力地去找的话，也许可以找到她的——而现在他却留下她走了。硬座车厢里非常闷热——这时他已经身无分文了。他走到连接车厢的通廊上，在一张折叠椅上坐下，望着车站从身旁一闪而过，一幢幢陌生的建筑物的背影后退过去。接着火车驶过广阔的春天的田野，和一辆黄色的电车在那里并肩飞驰了一会；电车上的人，说不准有谁在街上碰巧见到过她那张楚楚动人的脸庞。

铁轨拐了一个弯，现在火车背对着太阳行驶，落日的余晖普照大地，仿佛在为这个即将远去的、曾与黛西息息相关的城市祝福。他绝望地伸出手去，想要抓住哪怕是一缕轻烟，也好留住这个地方的一丁点的碎片，这里曾经因为她的存在而使他觉得那么美好。泪眼模糊中，他知道所有的这一切都将离他而去，一去不复返了，那最鲜活的、最美好的部分永远地失去了。

我们吃完早饭，走到外面阳台上去的时候，已经九点钟了。一夜之间天气骤然变了，空气中已经有一丝秋天的气息。一名园丁——盖茨比先前雇佣的那批佣人当中唯一留下来的人——来到台阶脚下。

“我今天准备把游泳池的水放掉，盖茨比先生。树叶很快就要开始飘落了，到时候管子容易堵塞。”

“今天不要放水。”盖茨比应道。他带点歉意地转身对着我，“你知道吗，老兄，整个夏天我一次都没有下去游过泳呢！”

我看了看我的表，站起身来。

“还有十二分钟我乘坐的那班车就要开了。”

我并不愿意进城去。我也没有心思做一点正经的工作，但是更重要的是——我不愿意离开盖茨比。我错过了那班火车，又误了下一班，才勉强起身离开。

“我给你打电话吧。”最后我说。

“别忘了，老兄。”

“我中午前后给你打电话。”

我们慢慢地走下了台阶。

“我想黛西也会打电话来的。”他神色不安地看着我，仿佛他希望能得到我的确认。

“我猜想她会的。”

“那么，再见。”

我们握了握手，然后我就离开了。快走到篱笆前时，我想起了一件事，于是又转过身来。

“他们一伙全是混蛋，”我隔着草坪冲他喊道，“他们那帮混蛋加在一起也比不上你。”

我后来总是感到很高兴我说了那句话。这是我对他说过的唯一的一句赞美之辞，因为我自始至终都不赞成他的做法。开始他很有礼貌地点点头，随后他的脸上绽放出那种容光焕发、心领神会的笑容，好像我们俩在这件事上早已狼狈为奸，相互勾结在一起了。他那套华丽的粉红色衣服在白色台阶的映衬下显得那么光彩夺目，于是我想起了三个月前我第一次踏进他那栋古色古香的别墅时情景。当时他的草坪和汽车道上人头攒动，大家纷纷揣测他的犯罪行径——而他站在台阶上和大家挥手告别，心中蕴藏着他那纯洁高尚的梦想。

我对他的殷勤款待表示感谢。我和其他的人——我们总是为这个谢他。

“再见，”我大声说，“谢谢你的早饭，盖茨比。”

到了城里以后，我试着整理了一会儿那不计其数的股票行情表格，后来就在我的转椅里睡着了。临近中午时，电话铃声把我吵醒了，我吃了一惊，额头上直冒汗珠子。电话是乔丹·贝克打来的。她时常在这个时候给我打电话，因为她总是行踪不定，不是在大饭店、俱乐部，就是在私人住宅里，我很难用任何其他办法找到她。通常她打电话时的声音总是清新悦耳的，好像一小块球棒削起的草皮从绿茵茵的高尔夫球场上缓缓飞进了办公室的窗口，但是今天上午，她的声音听上去却显得生硬枯涩。

“我离开了黛西的家，”她说，“我此刻在亨普斯特德53，今天下午就要到南安普敦54去。”

也许她离开黛西的家是很明智的，但是她的做法却使我不高兴。接着她下面一句话更叫我生气。

“昨天晚上你对我的态度可不怎么好。”

“在那种情况下又有什么关系呢？”

她沉默了片刻。接着说：“不管怎样……我想见你。”

“我也想见你。”

“那么我今天下午就不去南安普敦，下午进城来，好不好？”

“不好……我想今天下午不行。”

“随你的便吧。”

“今天下午实在不可能。各种各样的……”

我们就像这样聊了一会儿，后来突然间我们俩都不再说话了。我不知道我们俩当中是谁把电话“啪”的一下挂断了，但我知道我毫不在乎。我那天下午实在不可能跟她面对面的喝茶聊天，即使她从此永远不再跟我说话。

几分钟以后，我往盖茨比家打电话，但是电话一直占线，我一连打了四次，最后，一个不耐烦的接线员告诉我那条线路正在等待来自底特律的长途电话。我拿出列车时刻表，在3点50分的那班车上画了一个小圆圈。然后我靠在椅子上，想考虑一下。这时才是中午。

那天早上乘火车经过灰堆的时候，我特意走到车厢的另外一边。我猜想那儿整天都会有一群好奇的人围观，小男孩们在尘土中寻找黑色的血斑，还有一个爱饶舌的人翻来覆去地叙述着车祸发生的经过，一直说到连他自己也觉得越来越不真实，没有法子再往下说了，于是梅特尔·威尔逊悲惨的结局也就被人淡忘了。现在我要倒回去说一下前天夜里我们离开车行之后，那里发生的事情。

他们费了好大一番周折才找到了威尔逊太太的妹妹凯瑟琳。那天晚上她一定是打破了她自己不喝酒的戒律，因为她赶过来的时候已经喝得醉醺醺的，怎么也无法理解救护车已经开到弗勒兴区去了，等他们终于使她相信了这一点时，她立刻就昏厥过去了，好像这是整个事件中最让人难以忍受的部分。有个人，或是出于好心或是受好奇心驱使，让她上了他的车子，紧紧跟在运她姐姐遗体的车子后面一路开过去。

直到午夜过去很久以后，还是不断地有人赶来，聚集在车行前面，同时乔治·威尔逊在里面的长沙发上不停地前后摇晃着。起先办公室的门是开着的，每一个走进车行的人都不由自主地朝里面张望。后来有人说这太不像话了，才把门关上。米凯里斯和其他几个男人轮流陪着他。开始有四五个人，后来剩下两三个人。再到后来，米凯里斯不得不要求最后一个陌生人在那里多待十五分钟，他自己利用这点时间回家煮了壶咖啡。最后，他独自一个人待在那儿陪着威尔逊，直到东方破晓。

大约凌晨三点钟，威尔逊那前言不搭后语的喃喃话语发生了变化——他渐渐安静了下来，开始谈起那辆黄色的车子。他声称自己有办法查出来那辆黄车子是谁的。然后他又脱口而出，说他老婆两个月前有一次从城里回来的时候鼻青脸肿的事。

但是当他意识到自己说了这些话时，他畏缩了一下，又开始哭哭啼啼地叫喊“我的天哪！”米凯里斯想分散他的注意力，但笨口拙舌地不知说什么。

“你结婚多长时间了，乔治？得啦，安安静静坐一会儿，回答我的问题。你结婚多长时间了？”

“十二年了。”

“有过孩子吗？得啦，乔治，坐着别动——我刚才问你话呢。你有过孩子没有？”

棕色的硬壳甲虫不停地往昏暗的电灯上乱撞。每次米凯里斯听到外面的公路上有汽车疾驰而过，他就觉得听上去像是几个小时以前肇事后逃逸的那辆车。他不愿意走进汽车修理间，因为那张停放过尸体的工作台上仍沾有血迹。于是他只好坐立不安地在办公室里走来走去——还没到天亮时他已经把屋里的每一件东西都记得清清楚楚——他不时地又坐在威尔逊身边，想办法让他安静一些。

“乔治，你有一个经常去做做礼拜的教堂吗？也许你已经好久没去过了吧？也许我可以打电话给教堂，请一位牧师来，他可以跟你谈谈，好吗？”

“我不属于任何一个教堂。”

“你应当有个常去的教堂，乔治，碰到这种时候就有用了。你从前一定去过教堂的。难道你不是在教堂里结的婚吗？听着，乔治，你听我说。难道你不是在教堂里结婚的吗？”

“那是很久以前的事了。”

威尔逊因为要回答问题，他原先摇晃的节奏被打乱了——他安静了一会儿，随后，和原先一样的那种半清醒半迷糊的表情又回到了他黯淡无神的眼睛里。

“打开那个抽屉看看。”他说着，手指向那张办公桌。

“哪一个抽屉？”

“那个抽屉——就是那一个。”

米凯里斯打开了离他手边最近的那个抽屉。里面什么都没有，只有一根小巧贵重的狗链子，是用皮革和银线编织而成的。看上去还是新的。

“是这个吗？”他举起狗链子问道。

威尔逊盯着看了看，点点头。“我昨天下午发现它的。她想方设法给我解释它的由来，但是我知道这里面肯定有蹊跷。”

“你是说这是你太太买的吗？”

“她用薄纸包着放在她的梳妆台上。”

米凯里斯并没有发现这其中什么古怪，于是他对威尔逊说出十多个理由，解释他老婆为什么可能会买下这条狗链子，但是可以想象，威尔逊早已从梅特尔那里听过当中的某些理由了，因为他又轻轻地哼起：“我的天哪！”安慰他的人还有几个理由没再说出口，留在嘴边了。

“那么他杀害了她。”威尔逊说，他的嘴巴突然张得老大。

“谁杀害了她？”

“我有办法查出来。”

“你在胡思乱想，乔治，”他的朋友说，“这件事对你来说，是个沉重的打击，连自己说什么都不知道了。你还是安安静静地坐着，待到天亮再说。”

“他谋杀了她。”

“乔治，那是交通事故。”

威尔逊摇了摇头。他眼睛眯成一条缝，嘴巴微微张开，还不以为然地轻轻“哼”了一声。

“我知道，”他很确定地说，“我是个信任别人的人，从来也不想伤害什么人，但是只要我弄明白了一件事，那就一定错不了。就是开那辆汽车的那个男人。她跑过去想跟他说话，但是他却不肯停下来。”

米凯里斯当时也看到这个场景了，但他却并没感觉到这里面有什么特殊的意义。他以为威尔逊太太是从她丈夫那里跑开，而并不是想拦住某一辆汽车。

“她怎么可能那样做呢？”

“她这个人很有心计。”威尔逊说，仿佛这就回答了问题。“啊——哟——哟——”

他又开始摇晃起来，米凯里斯站在旁边，手里鼓捣着那条狗链子。

“或许你有什么朋友我可以打电话请过来帮帮忙吧，乔治？”

这种希望实在是太渺茫了——他几乎可以肯定威尔逊一个朋友也没有，他连个老婆都对付不了。又过了一会儿，他很高兴看到屋子里起了变化，窗户边渐渐泛起了蓝光，他知道天就快亮了。大约五点钟的时候，外面天色更蓝，屋子里的灯可以关掉了。

威尔逊呆滞的目光转向了外面的灰堆，那里的天空有小块的灰色云团，呈现出离奇古怪的形状，在黎明的微风中飘来飘去。

“我跟她谈过，”他沉默了大半天后喃喃地说，“我告诉她，她也许可以欺骗我，但她绝对骗不了上帝。我把她带到窗口，”他费劲地站了起来，走到后面的窗户跟前，把脸紧贴着窗户靠在上面，“然后对我说：‘上帝知道你在做什么，知道你所做的一切。你可以骗我，但你骗不了上帝！”

米凯里斯站在他背后，吃惊地看到他正紧盯着T.J.埃克尔堡大夫的眼睛，那双眼睛刚刚从渐渐消散的夜色中显现出来，暗淡无光，大而无神。

“上帝看到了一切。”威尔逊又说了一遍。

“那只是一幅广告。”米凯里斯安慰他。不知是什么事情使他从窗前掉转身子，回头朝屋子里看去，但是威尔逊在那里站了很长时间，脸紧靠着玻璃窗，冲着窗外的黎明不住地点头。

等到六点钟，米凯里斯已经筋疲力尽，终于听到有一辆车子在外面停了下来，他不由地感到庆幸。来人是昨天夜里帮着一起陪护的人当中的一个，答应了要再回来的，于是他做了三个人的早餐，他和那个人一起吃了。威尔逊现在比较安静，于是米凯里斯就回家去睡觉。四小时之后他醒了过来，急忙又跑回车行，却发现威尔逊已经不见了。

他的行踪——他一直是步行的——事后查明是先到了罗斯福港，从那里又到了盖兹山，他在那里买了一份三明治，可是并没有吃，还买了一杯咖啡。他一定很疲倦，走的速度很慢，因为他走到盖兹山时，已经是中午了。一直到这里，为他的时间和行踪做出交代并不难——有几个男孩子说看到过一个“疯疯癫癫”的男人，还有几个开车路过的人记得他站在路边神情古怪地盯着他们。以后三小时他就消失了踪迹。警察根据他对米凯里斯说他“有办法查出来”，猜想那段时间他可能在那带地方的一家又一家的车行里转悠，向人们打听一辆黄色的汽车。可是另一方面，并没有哪家车行的人站出来说看见过这么一个人，所以他或许有一种更简单、更可靠的办法去查出他所想要知道的事情。到下午两点半的时候，他到了西半岛，在那里他向人询问到盖茨比家去的路怎么走。这样看来，那时候他已经知道盖茨比的名字了。

下午两点钟盖茨比换上游泳衣，留了话给男管家，如果有人打电话来，就到游泳池来给他送个信。他先去车房拿了一个充气的橡皮垫子，整个夏天这个气垫都供他的客人们玩乐。司机帮他把垫子打足了气，然后他吩咐司机在任何情形下都不可以把那辆敞篷车开出去——而这是很奇怪的，因为这辆车前面右侧的挡泥板需要修理了。

盖茨比把垫子扛在肩上，向游泳池走去。有一次他停下来挪动了一下，司机问他要不要帮忙，但是他摇了摇头，再过一会就消失在叶片正在变黄的树木中了。

始终没有人打电话来，可是那位男管家也没有睡午觉，等电话一直等到四点——等到即使有电话来了，盖茨比再也不能接听了的时候。我推想盖茨比本人也不相信会有电话来的，也许他已经不在乎这个了。如果确实是这样的话，他一定会感悟到他已经失去了往昔的那个温暖的世界，感悟到他长期以来只为了一个梦想而活着，因此付出了那么高昂的代价。他一定曾经透过可怕的树叶仰望过一片陌生的天空，全身战栗，正如当他发觉玫瑰花是多么的丑恶，阳光照在刚刚抽出嫩芽的草地上又是多么残酷时一样，浑身发抖。这是一个崭新的世界，物质的，然而却并不真实，在这里可怜的鬼魂们，像呼吸空气那样醉生梦死，四处飘荡……就像那个灰蒙蒙的、举止怪异的人穿过杂乱的乱树丛，悄悄地向他走来。

那个司机——他是沃尔夫山姆手下的一个人——听到了枪声。事后他只能说他当时根本没有想到会有什么事情发生。我从火车站把车直接开到盖茨比家里，等我匆匆忙忙地冲上大门前的台阶时，才使屋里的人第一次感到是出事了，但是我认为当时他们肯定已经知道了。我们四个人，司机、男管家、园丁和我，几乎一句话也没说，就急匆匆奔到游泳池边。

清水从泳池的一端放进来，又匆忙地流向另一端的排水管，池子里面的水泛起一阵阵轻微的、几乎察觉不出的涟漪。随着微微泛起的涟漪，那只载有负重的气垫在泳池里漫无目的地漂着。一阵清风徐徐吹来，吹不皱池水，却足以改变那载着偶然重负的气垫的航向。一堆落叶使它慢慢打起转来，就好像经纬仪的支架一样，在水面上勾画出一道细细的红色的圈子。

我们抬着盖茨比的尸体朝着屋子那头走的路上，园丁才在不远的草丛里发现了威尔逊的尸体，于是这场血腥的屠杀就结束了。





第九章


事隔两年，我回想起来，只记得盖茨比出事的那天白天其余的时间，那天晚上以及第二天，一拨又一拨的警察、摄影师和新闻记者在盖茨比家的大门口进进出出。正门的大门上拉起了一根绳子，旁边站着一名警察把守，不让看热闹的人进来，但是小男孩们很快就发现他们可以从我的院子里绕进去，因此总有几个孩子目瞪口呆地聚集在游泳池旁边。那天下午，有一个煞有介事的人，也许是一名侦探，俯身检查威尔逊的尸体时用了“疯子”这个词，由于他的语气颇具权威的样子，第二天早上所有报纸都按照他定的调子进行报道。

大多数那些报道都把这件事描绘成一场噩梦——离奇古怪，捕风捉影，过分渲染而且全然失实。在验尸时，米凯里斯所做的证词透露出威尔逊怀疑他的妻子有外遇，我本来以为整个故事很快就会被添油加醋地刊登在黄色小报上——不料原以为会信口开河的凯瑟琳却保持了沉默，并且表现出惊人的坚强——她描过的眉毛底下，那双眼睛坚定的直视着验尸官，发誓说她姐姐从来没见过盖茨比，说她姐姐和她丈夫在一起生活非常美满，而且她姐姐从来没有什么品行不端过。她说得让人心服口服，连她自己都信以为真了，她用手帕捂着脸痛哭流涕，仿佛即使对她说的稍有疑问，她都是无法忍受。威尔逊就这样被归结为一个“因悲伤过度导致神经错乱”的人，从而使这个案子的案情简单明了，一锤定音。案子也就这样了结了。

但是，事情的这个部分似乎全部都是牵强附会、完全没有击中要害。我发现自己是站在盖茨比一边的，而且是孤身一人。从我打电话到西半岛镇报告惨案那一刻起，每一个对他的揣测、每一个实际的问题都提到我这里来。起初我感到又惊讶又迷惑，后来一小时又一小时过去了，他还是躺在他自己的房子里，一动不动，不呼吸也不说话，我才渐渐明白我要担负起的责任，因为除我以外没有其他人关心这件事——我所说的关心，是指每个人在死后都应该受到的或多或少别人对他的强烈的关心。

在我们发现他的尸体半小时之后，我就打了电话给黛西，出于本能地、毫不迟疑地给她打了电话。但是她和汤姆那天下午一早就出门了，还随身带了行李。

“没有留下地址吗？”

“没有。”

“说过他们什么时候回来吗？”

“没有。”

“知道他们去哪里了吗？我怎样才能和他们取得联系？”

“我不知道，说不上来。”

我真想给他找一个人来。我真想走到他躺着的那间屋子里去安慰他说：“我一定给你找一个人来，盖茨比。别担心。相信我好了，我一定给你找那个人来……”

迈尔·沃尔夫山姆的名字不在电话簿里。男管家把他百老汇办公室的地址给了我，我又打电话到电话局问讯处，但是等到我有了号码时，早就过了五点，已经没有人接电话了。

“请你再接一下好吗？”

“我已经接过三次了。”

“有非常要紧的事情。”

“对不起，那里恐怕没有人。”

我走回到客厅里，屋子里突然挤满了官方人员，最初的一瞬间，我还以为他们是一些不速之客。虽然他们掀开被单，用吃惊的眼光看着盖茨比，可是我脑子里不断回响的是他的抗议：“我说，老兄，你一定得替我找个人来。你必须想想办法。我不能一个人孤零零地在这里受罪啊。”

有人开始问我问题，我却摆脱了他们跑上了楼，匆匆忙忙翻了一下他书桌上没锁的那些抽屉——他从没明确地告诉我他的父母已经去世了，但是什么也找不到——只有丹·科迪的那张相片，那已经被人遗忘的粗野生活的象征，从墙上向下面凝视着。

第二天早上，我派男管家到纽约去给沃尔夫山姆送一封信，信中向他了解了一些情况，并恳请他务必搭下一班火车过来。我这样写的时候觉得那个请求完全是多此一举。我满以为他一看到报纸就会立刻赶来的，正如我认为中午以前黛西肯定会有电报来的——可是电报也没来，沃尔夫山姆先生也没到。什么人都没来，只有不断涌来的警察、摄影师和新闻记者。当男管家带回来沃尔夫山姆的回信时，我开始有一种蔑视一切的感觉，感到盖茨比和我可以团结起来，横眉冷对他们所有的人。

亲爱的卡洛维先生：

这个消息使我感到万分震惊，我几乎不敢相信这是真的。那个人干的这种疯狂的举动，值得我们大家都好好想想。我现在无法赶过来，因为我正在办理一些非常重要的业务，目前不能跟着牵连进这件事。倘若过些时候有什么我可以帮忙的，请派埃德加送封信通知我。我听到这种事后，简直不知道自己身在何处，而且完全被击垮了。

您真诚的：迈尔·沃尔夫山姆

随后在下面又匆匆附了一笔：

请通知我有关葬礼的事宜。又及：我根本不认识他家里人。

那天下午电话铃响，长途台说芝加哥有电话来，我以为黛西终于打电话来了，但等到接通了后，传来的却是一个男人的声音，微弱而遥远。

“我是斯拉格尔……”

“是吗？”这名字听上去很陌生。

“那封信糟糕透了，是不是？收到我的电报了吗？”

“什么电报都没有收到。”

“小帕克出事了，”他话说得很快，“他在柜台上交付股票的时候，被他们当场给逮住了。就在五分钟之前，那些家伙从纽约得到消息，知道了股票的号码。哎，这种事谁又能预料得到呢？在乡下这种地方你根本想不到……”

“喂！喂！”我上气不接下气地打断了他的话，“你听我说——我不是盖茨比先生。盖茨比先生死了。”

电话线那头沉默了很长时间，接着是一声惊呼……然后“咔嗒”一声，电话就挂断了。

我想大概是盖茨比死后的第三天，从明尼苏达州的一个小城镇发来了一封署名亨利·C.盖兹的电报。电报上说他马上动身，要求等他到达后再举行葬礼。

来人是盖茨比的父亲，一个表情严肃的老人，显得非常可怜，非常沮丧。在这样暖和的九月天了，他却裹上了一件廉价的长外套。他激动得眼泪不住地往下流，我从他手里把旅行包和雨伞接过来时，他开始一个劲地伸手去拉他那稀稀拉拉的灰白胡子。我费了好大劲才帮他把外套脱下来。他几乎都撑不住了，于是我把他领到音乐厅里去，让他坐下，一边叫人弄点东西给他吃，但是他却不肯吃东西，那杯牛奶也从他颤颤巍巍的手里洒了出来。

“我是在芝加哥的报纸上看到这个消息的，”他说，“芝加哥报纸上全都登了出来，我看到后就立刻动身了。”

“我没办法和您联系上。”

他的眼睛一刻不停地打量着房间，却似乎什么也没有看见。

“是一个疯子干的，”他说，“他一定是疯了。”

“您喝杯咖啡好吗？”我劝慰他。

“我什么都不要。我现在好了，您是……”

“卡洛维。”

“嗯，我现在好了。他们把杰米放在哪里了？”

我把他领进客厅里停放他儿子的地方，然后就走开了。有几个小男孩爬上了台阶，正在往门厅里张望。等到我告诉他们是谁来了，他们才极不情愿地走开了。

过了一会儿，盖兹先生打开门走了出来，他嘴巴微微张着，脸稍稍有点红，眼睛里断断续续地时不时地洒下几滴泪水。他已经是一大把年纪了，死亡不再会使他感到惊恐万分。这时他第一次向四周张望，看见门厅是如此的富丽堂皇，从这里连接着一个个大房间，又通向其他的房间，于是，他的悲伤里开始掺杂进一种既惊讶又自豪的感情。我把他搀扶到楼上的一间卧室里。他脱去他的外套和马甲的时候，我告诉他所有的安排都推迟到他来了之后。

“我不知道您打算怎么办，盖茨比先生……”

“我姓盖兹。”

“盖兹先生，我想您也许打算把遗体运到西部去。”

他摇了摇头。

“杰米一向都更喜欢东部。他是在东部出人头地，上升到他这个地位的。你是我孩子的朋友吗，先生？”

“我们是很要好的朋友。”

“他是大有前途的，你知道。他还很年轻，但是他在这个地方很好使。”

他郑重其事地用手碰碰脑袋，我也点了点头。

“假如他还活着的话，他会成为一个大人物的，像詹姆斯·J.希尔55那样的人，他会为国家的建设出力的。”

“确实是那样，”我局促不安地说。

他笨手笨脚地摆弄着绣花床罩，想把它从床上拉下来，接着就直挺挺地躺下去了——很快就睡着了。

那天晚上，一个显然很担惊受怕的人打电话来，而且一定要先知道我是谁，才肯报他自己的姓名。

“我是卡洛维。”我说。

“哦！”他听上去松了一口气，“我是克利普斯普林格。”

我也松了一口气，因为这就意味着盖茨比下葬的时候可能会多一个朋友了。我不愿意把布告等在报纸上，引来一大堆看热闹的人，因此我就自己打电话通知了几个人。他们可真难找到。

“明天举行葬礼，”我说，“下午3点，就在此地他的家里。我希望你能转告任何有意参加的人。”

“哦，我会的，”他急急忙忙地说，“当然啦，我不大可能见到什么人，但是如果我碰到的话，我会转告的。”

他的语气让我心生疑虑。

“你自己当然是要来的。”

“嗯，我当然会尽量去的。我打电话来是要问……”

“等等，”我打断了他的话，“先说你确定会来怎么样？”

“嗯，事实是……实际情况是这样的，我目前待在格林威治的一位朋友家里，人家很希望我明天能和他们待在一起。事实上，明天要去野餐什么的。当然，我会尽最大可能脱身的。”

我忍不住“哼”了一声，他也一定听到了，因为他很紧张地往下说：“我打电话来是为了我留在那里的一双鞋。不知道能不能麻烦你让男管家给我寄过来，你知道，那是一双网球鞋，我离了它简直没办法。我的地址是B.F……”

还没等他说完那个人的名字，我就把话筒挂上了。

在那以后，我为盖茨比感到愤愤不平——还有一个我打电话去找的绅士，他话里话外的意思竟然是盖茨比罪有应得。不过话说回来，这是我的过错，因为他是那些当初喝足了盖茨比的酒便对盖茨比冷嘲热讽的客人中的一个，我本来就不应该打电话给他的。

举行葬礼的那天早上，我到纽约去找迈尔·沃尔夫山姆。似乎用任何别的办法都找不到他。在开电梯的工人指点下，我推开了一扇门，门上写着“万字控股公司”，可是起先好像里面没有人，但是，我大声喊了几声“喂”却没人答应之后，一块隔板后面突然传出争辩的声音，接着一个漂亮的犹太女人出现在里面的一个门口，用她那含有敌意的黑眼睛上下打量着我。

“里面没人，”她说，“沃尔夫山姆先生到芝加哥去了。”

前一句话明显是在撒谎，因为里面有人已经开始用口哨吹起了不成调的《玫瑰经》。

“请转告一声卡洛维先生想见他。”

“我总不能把他从芝加哥叫回来，对不对？”

正在这时有一个声音，毫无疑问是沃尔夫山姆的声音，从屋子的那边喊了一声“斯特拉”。

“把你的名字留在桌上，”她很快地说，“等他回来我告诉他。”

“但是我知道他就在里面。”

她向我面前跨了一步，两只手开始愤怒地沿着臀部一上一下地移动。

“你们这些年轻人自以为你们随时可以闯进这里来，”她斥责道，“我们对此已经深恶痛绝了。我说他在芝加哥，他就是在芝加哥。”

我提了一下盖茨比的名字。

“哦……啊！”她又打量了我一番，“请您稍……您叫什么名字？”

她一下子就不见了。过了一会儿，迈尔·沃尔夫山姆就一脸严肃地站在门口，向我伸出了双手。他把我拉进他的办公室，用一种严肃的口吻说在这种时候我们大家都很难过，边说边递给我一支雪茄烟。

“我还记得我第一次见到他的情景，”他说，“他当时是一名刚刚离开军队的年轻的少校，胸前挂满了在战场上赢得的勋章。他那时候手头很紧，买不起便装，只好继续穿军服。我第一次见到他是那天他走进43号街怀恩勃兰纳开的弹子房找工作。他已经两天没吃饭了。‘跟我一块吃午饭去吧。’我说。不到半个小时他就吃了四块多美元的东西。”

“是你帮他做起生意来的吗？”我问。

“帮他！是我一手造就了他。”

“哦。”

“是我帮他白手起家、脱贫致富的。我一眼就看出他是个仪表堂堂、一派绅士风度的年轻人，等他告诉我他在牛津读过书时，我就知道他可以派上大用场。我让他加入了美国退伍军人协会，后来他在那里很出风头。不久，他就到奥尔巴尼56去为我的一个客户办了一件事。在所有的事情上我们都像这个一样亲密无间。”他举起了两个肥胖的指头，“总是在一起。”

我心里很想知道，他们的这种合作关系是否也包括1919年的世界棒球联赛那笔交易在内。

“现在他死了，”我停了一会儿才说，“你是他生前最亲密的朋友，所以我知道你今天下午一定会来参加他的葬礼。”

“我很想来。”

“那么就来吧。”

他鼻孔里的毛微微地抖了抖，摇了摇头，泪水盈眶。

“我不能去……我不能牵连进去。”他说。

“没有什么事可以牵连进去的。现在事情都过去了。”

“凡是有人被杀害，我总不愿意与自己有任何瓜葛。我置身事外。年轻的时候，我可不是这样——如果一个朋友死了，不管怎么回事，我总是同他们一起拼到最后。你也许会认为这是感情用事，可是我是说到做到的——一直拼到最后。”

我看出来是因为他个人的原因，他已经打定主意不去参加葬礼了。于是我就站了起来。

“你上过大学吗？”他突然问我。

有一会儿工夫，我还以为他要提出拉点什么“关系”，可是他只点了点头，跟我握了握手。

“咱们大家都应当学会在朋友活着的时候讲交情，而不要等到他死了之后，”他建议说，“在人去世以后，我个人的原则是不管闲事。”

我从他的办公室离开的时候，天色已经阴沉下来，我冒着蒙蒙细雨回到了西半岛。换过衣服之后我走到隔壁去，看到盖兹先生正激动地在大厅里踱来踱去。他对他儿子和他儿子的财富所感到的自豪一直在不断地增长，现在他又有一样东西要给我看。

“杰米寄给我的这张照片。”他手指颤抖着掏出了他的钱包，“你瞧吧。”

这是一张这座房子的照片，四只角已经破损了，因给许多手摸过而弄脏了。他亲切地指给我看每一处细节。“你瞧！”说完就看我眼中有没有露出赞赏的神情。他把这张照片给人家看了不知道有多少次，我相信在他看来现在照片比真房子还要更真实些。

“杰米把它寄给我的，我觉得这是一张很漂亮的照片，照得很清楚。”

“非常好。您最近见过他吗？”

“他两年前回家看过我，给我买下了我现在住的房子。当然，他从家里出走的时候我们很难过，不过我现在明白他那样做是有道理的。他知道自己前程远大，他成功之后一直对我很慷慨。”

他似乎不愿意把那张照片收起来，又依依不舍地在我眼前晃了一会。然后他把钱包放了回去，又从口袋里掏出一本破破烂烂的旧书，书名是《牛仔霍普郎·卡西迪》57“你瞧瞧，这本书是他小时候的。很能说明问题。”

他翻开了书的封底，转过来让我看，在最后一面的空白页上端端正正地用印刷体写着“作息时间表”几个字和1906年9月12日的日期。下面写着：

上午6：00　起床

6：15-6：30　练哑铃体操和爬墙

8：50-下午4：30　工作

更加孝顺父母

“我不经意间发现了这本书，”老人说，“很能说明问题，不是吗？”

“确实如此。”

“杰米是注定了会干出一番事业的，他总是制定一些这样那样的决心或者处事原则。你有没有注意，他用什么方法提高自己的思想？他在这方面从来都是很出色的。有一次他说我吃饭的样子像猪，我就揍了他一顿。”

他不情愿地把书合上，大声地把每一条读了一遍，然后热切地看着我。我想他很希望我能把那张表抄下来将来好派上用场。

快到三点的时候，路德教会的那位牧师从弗勒兴赶来了，于是我开始不由自主地向窗户外面看，看有没有别的车子过来。盖茨比的父亲也和我一样。随着时间一点一点地流逝，佣人都走进来站在大厅里等候。老人开始心神不定地直眨眼睛，同时他又惴惴不安地谈起外面这场雨来。牧师看了好几次表，我只好把他请到一边，请他再等半个小时，但是这毫无用处。没有一个人来。

五点钟左右，我们三辆车子组成的车队到达了墓地，冒着绵密的小雨，在大门旁边停了下来——打头的是一辆灵车，又黑又湿，怪难看的，接着是盖兹先生、牧师和我乘坐的大型轿车，再后面一点的是四五个佣人和西半岛镇的邮差乘坐的盖茨比家的旅行车，大家都淋得全身透湿了。正当我们穿过大门往墓地里走的时候，我听见一辆汽车停了下来，接着是有人踩着地上的积水在我们后面追上来的声音。我回首一看，原来是那位戴着猫头鹰式眼镜的人。三个月前的一个晚上，我看到过他在盖茨比的图书室里望着盖茨比的藏书赞叹不已。

从那以后我再也没见过他。我不知道他从哪里知道今天的葬礼，我也不知道他姓甚名谁。雨水顺着他的厚眼镜片流淌下来，他只好摘下眼镜擦一擦，再看着那块挡雨的帆布从盖茨比的坟墓上铺开来。

那一时刻，我很想回忆一下盖茨比，但是他已经远远地离开了，我只记起了黛西，她既没有发来唁电，也没有送上一束花，可这时我已经不再感到气恼了。我隐约听到有人低声祈祷：“愿雨中的逝者得到安息。”随后那个戴着猫头鹰眼镜的人用洪亮的声音说了一声：“阿门！”

我们零零散散地在雨中跑回到车子上。戴猫头鹰眼镜的人在墓地大门口跟我说了一会儿话。

“我没能赶到他家里去。”他说。

“其他人也都没能来。”

“什么！”他大吃一惊，“啊，我的上帝！他们过去可是成群结队地往那里去的。”

他又把眼镜摘了下来，把镜片里里外外都擦了一遍。

“这家伙真他妈的可怜！”他说。

我记忆中最深刻的景象之一就是每年圣诞节从预备学校，以及后来从大学回到西部时的情景。那些到芝加哥以外的地方去的同学，总会约定在某个12月的黄昏6点钟集合，相聚在那座古老、幽暗的联邦车站里，和几位家在芝加哥的同学匆匆话别；他们已经沉浸在节日的欢乐之中。我记得那些从东部某某私立女校返回的女学生的裘皮大衣，以及她们在严寒的空气中唧唧喳喳的欢笑声，记得我们发现熟人时挥手致意，记得我们互相比较收到的邀请：“你要到奥德威家去吗？赫西家呢？舒尔茨家呢？”还记得我们戴了手套的手里紧紧攥着的长条绿色车票。最后还有那芝加哥-密尔沃基-圣保罗铁路上的暗黄色的客车，它们停靠在站台门口的轨道上，看上去就像圣诞节一样令人愉快。

当我们乘坐的列车缓缓开出，驶进寒冬的黑夜和茫茫的白雪里，雪从我们的两边向远方伸展，迎着车窗闪耀，威斯康星州的小车站上昏黄的灯火一闪而过，这时空中突然吹来一阵使人神清气爽的凛冽寒风。我们吃过晚饭，穿过寒冷的车厢连接处往回走时，一路深深地呼吸着这寒气，在奇妙的一个小时当中，我们重新不留痕迹地融入这片土地之前，我们难于言喻地体会到自己和这片土地之间的血肉之情。

这就是我的中西部——不是麦田，不是草原，也不是瑞典移民的荒凉村镇，而是我青年时代乘坐的那些激动人心的返乡的火车，是严寒黑夜里的街灯，是雪橇的铃声，是圣诞冬青花环被窗内的灯火映在雪地的影子。我是其中的一部分，那漫长的冬日使我生出一种肃穆的情感；由于从小在卡洛维宅院里长大，态度上也不免有点自鸣得意。在我们那个城市里，家里住的房子仍旧世世代代相传称为某姓的宅院。我现在才明白这个故事归根到底是一个西部的故事——汤姆和盖茨比、黛西、乔丹和我，我们都是西部人，也许我们拥有共同的缺点，所以才会无形中不能适应东部的生活。

即使在东部最令我兴奋的时候，即使我真切地感觉到比之俄亥俄河对岸的那些枯燥乏味、零乱、臃肿的城镇，比之那些只有儿童和年迈的老人才可幸免于无休止的闲言碎语的城镇，东部具有极大的优越性——即使在那些时候，我也总觉得东部多少有些畸形的地方，尤其西半岛那个地方，仍然会经常出现在我做的比较怪诞的梦里。在我的梦中，这个小镇就像埃尔·格列柯58画的一幅夜景图：上百所房子，集传统与怪诞于一身，匍匐在一片阴沉沉的天空和黯淡无光的月亮之下。在前景里有四位神情严肃、身穿大礼服的男人抬着一副担架沿人行道走着，担架上面躺着一个喝得醉醺醺的女人，身上穿着一件白色的晚礼服。她一只手耷拉在一边，闪耀着珠宝的寒光。那几个男人脸色凝重地转身走进一所房子——却走错了地方。但是没人知道这个女人的名字，也没有人去关心。

盖茨比去世以后，东部就是这样闹鬼似的在我心目中萦绕着，形象扭曲到连我的眼力已无法矫正的程度。所以，当空气中飘散起焚烧枯叶的蓝烟，寒风把晾在绳子上的湿衣服吹得硬邦邦的时候，我就决定回家去了。

在我离开之前还有一件事要做，一件既尴尬又令人不悦的事，本来也许最好的办法是对它置之不理。但是我希望把一切都安排妥当，而不是寄希望于那个乐于帮忙而又不动声色的大海来把我的垃圾冲走。我去见了乔丹·贝克一面，仔仔细细谈起了在我们两人之间发生的事情，以及后来我的遭遇，而她一动也不动躺在一张大椅子里听着。

她穿的是打高尔夫球的运动服，我还记得我当时想过她看上去可真像一幅漂亮的插图；她的下巴神气地微微翘着，她头发像秋天树叶的金黄色，她的脸和她搁在膝盖上的浅棕色无指手套同一个颜色。等我讲完之后，她不做任何评论，只是告诉我她和另一个男人订婚了。我对此深表怀疑，虽然有好几个男人都在追求她，只要她一点头便可以结婚的，但是我仍故作惊诧。刹那间，我思量着自己是否犯了个错误，接着我很快地考虑了一下，就起身告辞。

“不管怎么说，是你把我甩掉的，”乔丹忽然说，“你那天在电话里把我甩了。我现在对你一点也不在乎了，但是当时那对我倒是一种新的经验，我有好一会儿感到晕晕乎乎的。”

我们俩握了握手。

“哦，你还记得吗，”她又加了一句，“我们有过一次聊到过关于开车的事？”

“啊……记不太清了。”

“我记得你说过一个蹩脚的司机只有在遇到另一个蹩脚的司机之前才是安全的话吗？瞧，我碰上了另外一个蹩脚的司机了，是不是？我是说我太马虎了，竟然这样看错了人。我以为你是一个相当诚实、直率的人。我以为那是你私底下引以为荣的事。”

“我已经三十岁了，”我说，“要是我年轻五岁的话，也许我还可以欺骗自己，并引以为荣。”

她没有回答。我对她十分生气，又有几分依恋，带着难以言表的遗憾，转身走开了。

10月下旬的一天下午，我遇见了汤姆·布坎南。他正沿着第五大街走在我的前面，还是那样机警和不可一世的样子，他的双手稍稍离开他的身体，仿佛要击退对方的侵扰一样，同时脑袋忽左忽右地转动，以适应他那双左顾右盼的眼睛。我正要放慢脚步免得赶上他时，他停了下来，蹙着眉头朝一家珠宝店的橱窗里望去。突然，他看见了我，回转身走过来，向我伸出手。

“怎么回事，尼克？你不愿意跟我握手吗？”

“是啊。你知道我对你的看法。”

“你疯了，尼克，”他急忙说，“疯得够呛。我不明白你到底怎么了。”

“汤姆，”我质问道，“那天下午你对威尔逊说了些什么？”

他一言不发地瞪着我，于是我知道我没有猜错在威尔逊失踪的那几个小时里发生的事情。我掉头就走，可是他追上前一步，抓住了我的胳臂。

“我对他说了实话，”他说，“我们正准备出门，这时他找上门来，后来我叫佣人传话说我们不在家，他就要硬往楼上冲。那时他已经有些神志不清了，要是我没告诉他那辆车子是谁的，他会把我给杀了。在我家的时候，他的手一刻也没有离开过装在他口袋里的那把左轮手枪……”他突然不再说下去了，态度变得蛮横起来，“就算我告诉他，又有什么错？那个家伙自己找死。他把你蒙蔽了，就像他蒙蔽了黛西一样，其实他是个心狠手辣的家伙。他撞死了梅特尔就像撞死了一条狗一样，连车子都不停一下。”

我无话可说，除了那个说不出来的事实：即事情并不是这样的。

“你以为我就没有感到痛苦吗？——我告诉你，我去退掉那套公寓时，看见那盒该死的喂狗的饼干还摆放在餐具柜上，我就一下子瘫坐在地上，像个孩子似的号啕大哭起来。天哪，我真是太难受了……”

我不能原谅他，也不能喜欢他，但是我发现，他所做的事情在他自己看来完全是合情合理的。整件事情都是不负责任、混乱不堪的。汤姆和黛西，他们是不负责任的人——他们砸碎了东西，把别人给毁了，然后就退缩到自己的金钱或者麻木不仁、漫不经心当中，或者是任何把他们维系在一起的东西当中，让别人去收拾他们留下的一堆烂摊子……

我跟他握了握手。不肯握手未免太愚蠢了，因为我突然发现我似乎是在跟一个小孩子说话。随后他走进那家珠宝店去买了一串珍珠项链——或者也许只是一副袖扣——永远摆脱了我这乡下佬对他的吹毛求疵。

我离开的时候，盖茨比的房子仍然空着——他的草坪上的草长得跟我这边的草一样高了。村子里有一个出租汽车司机每次载客人经过大门口时，总是要把车子停下来，对着里面指指点点。也许出事的那天晚上，就是他开车送黛西和盖茨比到东半岛的，不然就是他自己编造了一个独具匠心的故事。我可不要听他讲什么故事，所以我下火车时总躲开他。

每星期六的晚上，我都要去纽约过夜，因为盖茨比举办的那些灯火辉煌、令人眼花缭乱的晚会仍然历历在目，我仍然能够听到他的花园里飘过来音乐声和欢笑的声音，隐隐约约，连绵不断，还有一辆辆汽车在他家的车道上来来往往。有一天晚上，我确实听见真有一辆汽车开到那儿去，看见车灯照在大门口的台阶上，不过我并没有前去探个究竟。也许那是最后的一位客人，刚从天涯海角归来，还不知道晚会已经永远结束了。

在最后那个晚上，我已经打点好行装，车子也卖给了杂货店老板，我走过去再看一眼那座宏大而杂乱的、象征着失败的房子。白色大理石台阶上，不知被哪个男孩用一块砖头胡乱地涂了一个下流的字眼儿，在月色中显得格外的醒目，于是我用鞋子在石头上擦来擦去，把它擦掉了。后来我又漫步到海边，仰天朝天地躺在沙滩上。

这时，海滨大多数的别墅都已经关闭了，四周几乎没有什么灯火，除了海湾对岸一艘渡船上若有若无的一丝微弱灯光。一轮明月渐渐上升，那些微不足道的房屋开始慢慢隐退于月色之中，直到我逐渐意识这里就是到当年让荷兰水手的眼睛大放异彩的古老小岛——新世界的清新稚嫩的胸膛。那些已经不复存在的树木，那些为建造盖茨比的别墅而被砍伐的树木，曾经在此迎风飘扬，低声应和着人类最后的也是最伟大的梦想。在被迷惑的短暂瞬间，人类面对这块新大陆一定屏声息气，不由自主地陷入到一种他既不明白也不渴求的美学沉思中，也是人类在历史上最后一次面对面地欣赏着合乎他想象力的奇幻美景。

当我坐在那里怅惘地缅怀这个古老的，又不为人知的世界时，我想象着盖茨比在黛西的码头上，第一次认出那盏绿灯时所感受到的惊奇。他走过了漫长的道路才来到这片蓝色的草坪，他的梦想曾经显得近在咫尺，唾手可得，几乎伸手就可以抓住。他不知道那个梦已经远他而去，把他抛在后面，抛在这个城市以外那一片无垠的混沌之中，在那里合众国的黑黝黝的原野在夜色中绵亘起伏。

盖茨比相信那盏绿灯，相信那个年复一年渐行渐远的令人沉醉的未来。它以前从我们身边溜走了，不过那没关系——明天我们将会跑得更快，胳膊也伸得更远……总会有一个天气晴朗的早晨……

于是，我们努力向前划，逆流而上的小舟，不停地被浪潮推回到过去。

Then wear the gold hat, if that will move her；

If you can bounce high, bounce for her too.

Till she cry

“Lover, gold-hatted, high-bouncing lover, I must have you！”

CHAPTER 1


In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.

‘Whenever you feel like criticising anyone，'he told me，‘just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.'

He didn't say any more, but we've always been unusually communi-cative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In consequence, I'm inclined to reserve all judgements, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores.The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men.Most of the confidences were unsought-frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation or a hostile levity when I realised by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon；for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions.Reserving judgements is a matter of infinite hope.I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.

And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes, but after a certain point I don't care what it's founded on.When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention for ever；I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart.Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction-Gatsby, who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn.If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away.This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the‘creative temperament'-it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again.No-Gatsby turned out all right at the end；it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.

M y family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this Middle Western city for three generations. The Carraways are something of a clan, and we have a tradition that we're descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather's brother, who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil War, and started the wholesale hardware business that my father carries on today.

I never saw this great-uncle, but I'm supposed to look like him-with special reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in father's office. I graduated from New Haven in 19 15，just a quarter of a century after my father, and a little later I participated in that delayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War.I enjoyed the counter raid so thoroughly that I came back restless.Instead of being the warm centre of the world, the Middle West now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe-so I decided to go East and learn the bond business.Everybody I knew was in the bond business, so I supposed it could support one more single man.All my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were choosing a prep school for me, and finally said，‘Why-ye-es，'with very grave, hesitant faces.Father agreed to finance me for a year, and after various delays I came East, permanently, I thought, in the spring of twenty-two.

The practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warm season, and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting town, it sounded like a great idea. He found the house, a weather-beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington, and I went out to the country alone.I had a dog-at least I had him for a few days until he ran away-and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman, who made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove.

It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more recently arrived than I, stopped me on the road.

‘How do you get to West Egg village?'he asked helplessly.

I told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer.I was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler.He had casually conferred on me the freedom of the neighbourhood.

And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.

There was so much to read, for one thing, and so much fine health to be pulled down out of the young breath-giving air. I bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities, and they stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint, promising to unfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Maecenas knew.And I had the high intention of reading many other books besides.I was rather literary in college-one year I wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the Yale News-and now I was going to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most limited of all specialists, the‘well-rounded man'.This isn't just an epigram-life is much more successfully looked at from a single window, after all.

It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of the strangest communities in North America. It was on that slender riotous island which extends itself due east of New York-and where there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land.Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound.They are not perfect ovals-like the egg in the Columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the contact end-but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual wonder to the gulls that fly overhead.To the wingless a more interesting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size.

I lived at West Egg, the-well, the less fashionable of the two, though this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between them. M y house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season.The one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard-it was a factual imitation of some Hotel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden.It was Gatsby's mansion.Or, rather, as I didn't know M r Gatsby, it was a mansion, inhabited by a gentleman of that name.M y own house was an eyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had been overlooked, so I had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbour's lawn, and the consoling proximity of millionaires-all for eighty dollars a month.

Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins on the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom Buchanans. Daisy was my second cousin once removed, and I'd known Tom in college.And just after the war I spent two days with them in Chicago.

Her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven-a national figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterwards savours of anticlimax. His family were enormously wealthy-even in college his freedom with money was a matter for reproach-but now he'd left Chicago and come East in a fashion that rather took your breath away；for instance, he'd brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake For­est.It was hard to realise that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough to do that.

Why they came East I don't know. They had spent a year in France for no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich together.This was a permanent move, said Daisy over the telephone, but I didn't believe it-I had no sight into Daisy's heart, but I felt that Tom would drift on for ever, seeking, a little wistfully, for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game.

And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East Egg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all. Their house was even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red-and-white Georgian colonial mansion, overlooking the bay.The lawn started at the beach and ran towards the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over sundials and brick walks and burning gardens-finally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run.The front was broken by a line of French windows, glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm windy afternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs apart on the front porch.

He had changed since his New Haven years. Now he was a sturdy straw-haired man of thirty with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner.Two shining arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward.Not even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that body-he seemed to fill those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat.It was a body capable of enormous leverage-a cruel body.

His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of paternal contempt in it, even towards people he liked-and there were men at New Haven who had hated his guts.

‘Now, don't think my opinion on these matters is final，'he seemed to say，‘just because I'm stronger and more of a man than you are.'We were in the same senior society, and while we were never intimate I always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.

We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.

‘I've got a nice place here，'he said, his eyes flashing about restlessly.

Turning me around by one arm, he moved a broad flat hand along the front vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half-acre of deep, pungent roses, and a snub-nosed motor-boat that bumped the tide offshore.

‘It belonged to Demaine, the oil man.'He turned me around again, politely and abruptly.‘W e'll go inside.'

We walked through a high hallway into a bright rose-coloured space, fr agilely bound into the house by French windows at either end. The windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house.A breeze blew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags, twisting them up towards the frosted wedding-cake of the ceiling, and then rippled over the wine-coloured rug, making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea.

The only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon. They were both in white, and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house.I must have stood for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall.Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room, and the curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor.

The younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was extended full length at her end of the divan, completely motionless, and with her chin raised a little, as if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely to fall.If she saw me out of the comer of her eyes she gave no hint of it-indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring an apology for having disturbed her by coming in.

The other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise-she leaned slightly forward with a conscientious expression-then she laughed, an absurd charming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the room.

‘I'm p-paralysed with happiness.'

She laughed again, as if she had said something very witty, and held my hand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was no one in the world she so much wanted to see. That was a way she had.She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was Baker.（I've heard it said that Daisy's murmur was only to make people lean towards her；an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.）

At any rate, Miss Baker's lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost imperceptibly, and then quickly tipped her head back again-the object she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something of a fright. Again a sort of apology arose to my lips.Almost any exhibition of complete self-sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me.

I looked back at my cousin, who began to ask me questions in her low, thrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again.Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget；a singing compulsion, a whispered‘Listen'，a promise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour.

I told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way East, and how a dozen people had sent their love through me.

‘Do they miss me?'she cried ecstatically.

‘The whole town is desolate. All the cars have the left；rear wheel painted black as a mourning wreath, and there's a persistent wail all night along the north shore.'

‘H ow gorgeous！Let's go back, Tom. Tomorrow！'Then she added irrelevantly：‘You ought to see the baby.'

‘I'd like to.'

‘She's asleep. She's three years old.Haven't you ever seen her?'

‘Never.'

‘Well, you ought to see her. She's-'

Tom Buchanan, who had been hovering restlessly about the room, stopped and rested his hand on my shoulder.

‘What you doing, Nick?'

Tm a bond man.'

‘Who with?'

I told him.

‘Never heard of them，'he remarked decisively.

This annoyed me.

‘You will，'I answered shortly.‘You will if you stay in the East.'

‘Oh, I'll stay in the East, don't you worry，'he said, glancing at Daisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something more.‘I'd be a God-damned fool to live anywhere else.'

At this point Miss Baker said：‘Absolutely！'with such suddenness that I started-it was the first word she had uttered since I came into the room. Evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned and with a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.

‘I'm stiff，'she complained，‘I've been lying on that sofa for as long as I can remember.'

‘Don't look at me，'Daisy retorted，‘I've been trying to get you to New York all afternoon.'

‘No, thanks，'said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in from the pantry，‘I'm absolutely in training.'

Her host looked at her incredulously.

‘You are！'He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom of a glass.‘How you ever get anything done is beyond me.'

I looked at Miss Baker, wondering what it was she‘got done'. I enjoyed looking at her.She was a slender, small-breasted girl, with an erect carriage, which she accentuated by throwing her body backward at the shoulders like a young cadet.Her grey sun-strained eyes looked back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming, discontented face.It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a picture of her, somewhere before.

‘You live in West Egg，'she remarked contemptuously.‘I know somebody there.'

‘I don't know a single-'

‘You must know Gatsby.'

‘Gatsby?'demanded Daisy.‘What Gatsby?'

Before I could reply that he was my neighbour, dinner was announced；wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine, Tom Buchanan compelled me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square.

Slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips, the two young women preceded us out on to a rosy-coloured porch, open towards the sunset, where four candles flickered on the table in the diminished wind.‘Why candles?'objected Daisy, frowning. She snapped them out with her fingers.‘In two weeks it'll be the longest day in the year.'She looked at us all radiantly.‘Do you always watch for the longest day of the year and then miss it?I always watch for the longest day in the year and then miss it.'

‘We ought to plan something，'yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at the table as if she were getting into bed.

‘All right，'said Daisy.‘What'll we plan?'She turned to me helplessly：‘What do people plan?'

Before I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her little finger.

‘Look！'she complained；‘I hurt it.'

We all looked-the knuckle was black and blue.

‘You did it, Tom，'she said accusingly.‘I know you didn't mean to, but you did do it. That's what I get for marrying a brute of a man, a great, big, hulking physical specimen of a-'

‘I hate that word hulking，'objected Tom crossly，‘even in kidding.'

‘Hulking，'insisted Daisy.

Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all desire. They were here, and they accepted Tom and me, making only a polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained.They knew that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening, too, would be over and casually put away.It Was sharply different from the West, where an evening was hurried from phase to phase towards its close, in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer nervous dread of the moment itself.

‘You make me feel uncivilised, Daisy，'I confessed on my second glass of corky but rather impressive claret.‘Can't you talk about crops or something?'

I meant nothing in particular by this remark, but it was taken up in an unexpected way.

‘Civilisation's going to pieces，'broke out Tom violently.‘I've gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you read The Rise of the Coloured Empires by this man Goddard?'

‘Why, no，'I answered, rather surprised by his tone.

‘Well, it's a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea is if we don't look out the white race will be-will be utterly submerged.It's all scientific stuff；it's been proved.'

‘Tom's getting very profound，'said Daisy, with an expression of unthoughtful sadness.‘He reads deep books with long words in them. What was that word we-'

‘Well, these books are all scientific，'insisted Tom, glancing at her impatiently.‘This fellow has worked out the whole thing. It's up to us, who are the dominant race, to watch out or these other races will have control of things.'

‘W e've got to beat them down，'whispered Daisy, winking fer-ociously towards the fervent sun.

‘You ought to live in California-'began Miss Baker, but Tom interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair.

‘This idea is that we're Nordics. I am, and you are, and you are, and-'After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a slight nod, and she winked at me again.‘-And we've produced all the things that go to make civilisation-oh, science and art, and all that.Do you see?'

There was something pathetic in his concentration, as if his complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more. When, almost immediately, the telephone rang inside and the buder left the porch Daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned towards me.

‘I'll tell you a family secret，'she whispered enthusiastically.‘It's about the butler's nose. Do you want to hear about the butler's nose?'

‘That's why I came over tonight.'

‘Well, he wasn't always a butler；he used to be the silver polisher for some people in New York that had a silver service for two hundred people. He had to polish it from morning till night, until finally it began to affect his nose-'

‘Things went from bad to worse，'suggested Miss Baker.

‘Yes. Things went from bad to worse, until finally he had to give up his position.'

For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face；her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I listened-then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering regret, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.

The butler came back and murmured something close to Tom's ear, whereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair, and without a word went inside. As if his absence quickened something within her, Daisy leaned forward again, her voice glowing and singing.

‘I love to see you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a-of a rose, an absolute rose.Doesn't he?'She turned to Miss Baker for confirmation：‘An absolute rose?'

This was untrue. I am not even faintly like a rose.She was only extemporising, but a stirring warmth flowed from her, as if her heart was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless， thrilling words.Then suddenly she threw her napkin on the table and excused herself and went into the house.

Miss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of meaning. I was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said‘Sh！'in a warning voice.A subdued, impassioned murmur was audible in the room beyond, and Miss Baker leaned forward unashamed, trying to hear.The murmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down, mounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether.

‘This Mr Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbour-'I began.

‘Don't talk. I want to hear what happens.'

‘Is something happening?'I enquired innocently.

‘You mean to say you don't know?'said Miss Baker, honestly surprised.‘I thought everybody knew.'

‘I don't.'

‘Why-'she said hesitantly，‘Tom's got some woman in New York.'

‘Got some woman?'I repeated blankly.

Miss Baker nodded.

‘She might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner time. Don't you think?'

Almost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a dress and the crunch of leather boots, and Tom and Daisy were back at the table.

‘It couldn't be helped！'cried Daisy with tense gaiety.

She sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me, and continued：‘I looked outdoors for a minute, and it's very romantic outdoors. There's a bird on the lawn that I think must be a nightingale come over on the Cunard or White Star Line.He's singing away-'Her voice sang：‘It's romantic, isn’t it, Tom?’

‘Very romantic，'he said, and then miserably to me：‘If it's light enough after dinner, I want to take you down to the stables.'

The telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook her head decisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact all subjects, vanished into air. Among the broken fragments of the last five minutes at table I remember the candles being lit again, pointlessly, and I was conscious of wanting to look squarely at everyone, and yet to avoid all eyes.I couldn't guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking, but I doubt if even Miss Baker, who seemed to have mastered a certain hardy scepticism, was able utterly to put this fifth guest's shrill metallic urgency out of mind.To a certain temperament the situation might have seemed intriguing-my own instinct was to telephone immediately for the police.

The horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again. Tom and Miss Baker, with several feet of twilight between them, strolled back into the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while, trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf, I followed Daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front.In its deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee.

Daisy took her face in her hands as if feeling its lovely shape, and her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk. I saw that turbulent emotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be some sedative questions about her little girl.

‘We don't know each other very well, Nick，'she said suddenly.‘Even if we are cousins. You didn't come to my wedding.'

‘I wasn't back from the war.'

‘That's true.'She hesitated.‘Well, I've had a very bad time, Nick, and I'm pretty cynical about everything.'

Evidently she had reason to be. I waited but she didn't say any more, and after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her daughter.

‘I suppose she talks, and-eats, and everything.'

‘Oh, yes.'She looked at me absently.‘Listen, Nick；let me tell you what I said when she was born. Would you like to hear?'

‘Very much.'

‘It'll show you how I've gotten to feel about-things. Well, she was less than an hour old and Tom was God knows where.I woke up out of the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling, and asked the nurse right away if it was a boy or a girl.She told me it was a girl, and so I turned my head away and wept.“All right，”I said，“I'm glad it's a girl.And I hope she'll be a fool-that’s the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.”

‘You see I think everything's terrible anyhow，'she went on in a convinced way.‘Everybody thinks so-the most advanced people. And I know.I've been everywhere and seen everything and done every­thing.'Her eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like Tom's, and she laughed with thrilling scorn.‘Sophisticated-God, I’m sophisticated！’

The instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention, my belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said. It made me uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to exact a contributory emotion from me.I waited, and sure enough, in a moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face, as if she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret society to which she and Tom belonged.

Inside, the crimson room bloomed with light. Tom and Miss Baker sat at either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from The Saturday Evening Post-the words, murmurous and uninflected, running together in a soothing tune.The lamplight, bright on his boots and dull on the autumn-leafyellow of her hair, glinted along the paper as she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms.

When we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand.

‘To be continued，'she said, tossing the magazine on the table，‘in our very next issue.'

Her body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and she stood up.

‘Ten o'clock，'she remarked, apparently finding the time on the ceiling.‘Time for this good girl to go to bed.'

‘Jordan's going to play in the tournament tomorrow，'explained Daisy，‘over at Westchester.'

‘Oh-you'ref ordan Baker.'

I knew now why her face was familiar-its pleasing contemptuous expression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of the sporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach. I had heard some story of her too, a critical, unpleasant story, but what it was I had forgotten long ago.

‘Good-night，'she said softly.‘Wake me at eight, won't you?'

‘If you'll get up.'

‘I will. Good-night, M r Carraway.See you anon.'

‘O f course you will，'confirmed Daisy.‘In fact, I think I'll arrange a marriage. Come over often Nick, and I'll sort of-oh-fling you together.You know-lock you up accidentally in linen closets and push you out to sea in a boat, and all that sort of thing-'

‘Good-night，'called Miss Baker from the stairs.‘I haven't heard a word.'

‘She's a nice girl，'said Tom after a moment.‘They oughtn't to let her run around the country this way.'

‘Who oughtn't to?'enquired Daisy coldly.

‘Her family.'

‘Her family is one aunt about a thousand years old. Besides, Nick's going to look after her, aren't you, Nick?She's going to spend lots of weekends out here this summer.I think the home influence will be very good for her.'

Daisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment in silence.

‘Is she from New York?'I asked quickly.

‘From Louisville. Our white girlhood was passed together there.Our beautiful white-'

‘Did you give Nick a little heart-to-heart talk on the veranda?'demanded Tom suddenly.

‘Did I?'She looked at me.‘I can't seem to remember, but I think we talked about the Nordic race. Yes, I'm sure we did.It sort of crept up on us and first thing you know-'

‘Don't believe everything you hear, Nick，'he advised me.

I said lightly that I had heard nothing at all, and a few minutes later I got up to go home. They came to the door with me and stood side by side in a cheerful square of light.As I started my motor Daisy peremptorily called：‘Wait！I forgot to ask you something, and it's important.We heard you were engaged to a girl out West.'

‘That's right，'corroborated Tom kindly.‘We heard that you were engaged.'

‘It's a libel. I'm too poor.'

‘But we heard it，'insisted Daisy, surprising me by opening up again in a flower-like way.‘We heard it from three people, so it must be true.'

Of course I knew what they were referring to, but I wasn't even vaguely engaged. The fact that gossip had published the banns was one of the reasons I had come East.You can't stop going with an old friend on account of rumours, and on the other hand I had no intention of being rumoured into marriage.

Their interest rather touched me and made them less remotely rich-nevertheless, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove away. It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out of the house, child in arms-but apparently there were no such intentions in her head.As for Tom, the fact that he‘had some woman in New York'was really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a book.Something was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his peremptory heart.

Already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside garages, where new red gas-pumps sat out in pools of fight, and when I reached my estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and sat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard. The wind had blown off, leaving a loud, bright night, with wings beating in the trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth blew the frogs full of life.The silhouette of a moving cat wavered across the moonlight, and turning my head to watch it, I saw that I was not alone-fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my neighbour's mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets regarding the silver pepper of the stars.Something in his leisurely movements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested that it was Mr Gatsby himself, come out to determine what share was his of our local heavens.

I decided to call to him. Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, and that would do for an introduction.But I didn't call to him, for he gave a sudden intimation that he was content to be alone-he stretched out his arms towards the dark water in a curious way, and, far as I was from him, I could have sworn he was trembling.Involuntarily I glanced seaward-and distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute and far away, that might have been the end of a dock.When I looked once more for Gatsby he had vanished, and I was alone again in the unquiet darkness.





CHAPTER 2


About halfway between West Egg and New York the motor road hastily joins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile, so as to shrink away from a certain desolate area of land. This is a valley of ashes-a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens；where ashes take the forms of houses and chimneys and rising smoke and, finally, with a transcendent effort, of ash-grey men who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air.Occasionally a line of grey cars crawls along an invisible track, gives out a ghastly creak, and comes to rest, and immediately the ash-grey men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud, which screens their obscure operations from your sight.

But above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift endlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T. J.Eckleburg.The eyes of Doctor T.J.Eckleburg are blue and gigantic-their retinas are one yard high.They look out of no face, but, instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a nonexistent nose.Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them there to fatten his practice in the borough of Queens, and then sank down himself into eternal blindness, or forgot them and moved away.But his eyes, dimmed a little by many paintless days, under sun and rain, brood on over the solemn dumping ground.

The valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river, and, when the drawbridge is up to let barges through, the passengers on waiting trains can stare at the dismal scene for as long as half an hour. There is always a halt there of at least a minute, and it was because of this that I first met Tom Buchanan's mistress.

The fact that he had one was insisted upon wherever he was known. His acquaintances resented the fact that he turned up in popular cafes with her and, leaving her at a table, sauntered about, chatting with whomsoever he knew.Though I was curious to see her, I had no desire to meet her-but I did.I went up to New York with Tom on the train one afternoon, and when we stopped by the ash-heaps he jumped to his feet and, taking hold of my elbow, literally forced me from the car.

W e're getting off，'he insisted.‘I want you to meet my girl.'

I think he'd tanked up a good deal at luncheon, and his determination to have my company bordered on violence. The supercilious assumption was that on Sunday afternoon I had nothing better to do.

I followed him over a low whitewashed railroad fence, and we walked back a hundred yards along the road under Doctor Eckleburg's persistent stare. The only building in sight was a small block of yellow brick sitting on the edge of the waste land, a sort of compact Main Street ministering to it, and contiguous to absolutely nothing.One of the three shops it contained was for rent and another was an all-night restaurant, approached by a trail of ashes；the third was a garage-Repairs.G e o r g e B.W i l s o n.Cars bought and sold.-and I followed Tom inside.

The interior was unprosperous and bare；the only car visible was the dust-covered wreck of a Ford which crouched in a dim comer. It had occurred to me that this shadow of a garage must be a blind, and that sumptuous and romantic apartments were concealed overhead, when the proprietor himself appeared in the door of an office, wiping his hands on a piece of waste.He was a blond, spiritless man, anaemic, and faintly handsome.When he saw us a damp gleam of hope sprang into his light blue eyes.

‘Hello, Wilson, old man，'said Tom, slapping him jovially on the shoulder.‘How's business?'

‘I can't complain，'answered Wilson unconvincingly.‘When are you going to sell me that car?'

‘Next week；I've got my man working on it now.'

‘Works pretty slow, don't he?'

‘No, he doesn't，'said Tom coldly.‘And if you feel that way about it, maybe I'd better sell it somewhere else after all.'

‘I don't mean that，'explained Wilson quickly.‘I just meant-'

His voice faded off and Tom glanced impatiently around the garage. Then I heard footsteps on a stairs, and in a moment the thickish figure of a woman blocked out the light from the office door.She was in the middle thirties, and faintly stout, but she carried her flesh sensuously, as some women can.Her face, above a spotted dress of dark blue crêpe-de-chine, contained no facet or gleam of beauty, but there was an immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of her body were continually smouldering.She smiled slowly and, walking through her husband as if he were a ghost, shook hands with Tom, looking him flush in the eye.Then she wet her lips, and without turning around spoke to her husband in a soft, coarse, voice：‘Get some chairs, why don’t you, so somebody can sit down.’

‘Oh, sure，'agreed Wilson hurriedly, and went towards the little office, mingling immediately with the cement colour of the walls. A white ashen dust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled everything in the vicinity-except his wife, who moved close to Tom.

‘I want to see you，'said Tom intently.‘Get on the next train.'

‘All right.'

‘I'll meet you by the news-stand on the lower level.'

She nodded and moved away from him just as George Wilson emerged with two chairs from his office door.

We waited for her down the road and out of sight. It was a few days before the Fourth ofJuly, and a grey, scrawny Italian child was setting torpedoes in a row along the railroad track.

‘Terrible place, isn't it，'said Tom, exchanging a frown with Doctor Eckleburg.

‘Awful.'

‘It does her good to get away.'

‘Doesn't her husband object?'

‘Wilson?He thinks she goes to see her sister in New York. He's so dumb he doesn't know he's alive.'

So Tom Buchanan and his girl and I went up together to New York-or not quite together, for Mrs Wilson sat discreetly in another car. Tom deferred that much to the sensibilities of those East Eggers who might be on the train.

She had changed her dress to a brown figured muslin, which stretched tight over her rather wide hips as Tom helped her to the platform in New York. At the news-stand she bought a copy of Town Tattle and a moving-picture magazine, and in the station drugstore some cold cream and a small flask of perfume.Upstairs, in the solemn echoing drive, she let four taxicabs drive away before she selected a new one, lavender-coloured with grey upholstery, and in this we slid out from the mass of the station into the glowing sunshine.But immediately she turned sharply from the window and, leaning forward, tapped on the front glass.

‘I want to get one of those dogs，'she said earnestly.‘I want to get one for the apartment. They're nice to have-a dog.'

We backed up to a grey old man who bore an absurd resemblance to John D. Rockefeller.In a basket swung from his neck cowered a dozen very recent puppies of an indeterminate breed.

‘What kind are they?'asked Mrs Wilson eagerly, as he came to the taxi-window.

‘All kinds. What kind do you want, lady?'

‘I'd like to get one of those police dogs；I don't suppose you got that kind?'

The man peered doubtfully into the basket, plunged in his hand and drew one up, wriggling, by the back of the neck.

‘That's no police dog，'said Tom.

‘No, it's not exactly a police dog，'said the man with disappointment in his voice.‘It's more of an Airedale.'He passed his hand over the brown wash-rag of a back.‘Look at that coat. Some coat.That's a dog that’ll never bother you with catching cold.’

‘I think it's cute，'said Mrs Wilson enthusiastically.‘How much is it?'

‘That dog?'He looked at it admiringly.‘That dog will cost you ten dollars.'

The Airedale-undoubtedly there was an Airedale concerned in it somewhere, though its feet were startlingly white-changed hands and settled down into Mrs Wilson's lap, where she fondled the weather-proof coat with rapture.

‘Is it a boy or a girl?'she asked delicately.

‘That dog?That dog's a boy.'

‘It's a bitch，'said Tom decisively.‘Here's your money. Go and buy ten more dogs with it.'

We drove over to Fifth Avenue, warm and soft, almost pastoral, on the summer Sunday afternoon. I wouldn't have been surprised to see a great flock of white sheep turn the comer.

‘Hold on，'I said，‘I have to leave you here.'

‘No you don't，'interposed Tom quickly.‘Myrde'll be hurt if you don't come up to the apartment. Won't you Myrtle?’

‘Come on，'she urged.‘I'll telephone my sister Catherine. She's said to be very beautiful by people who ought to know.'

‘Well, I'd like to, b u t-'

We went on, cutting back again over the Park towards the West Hundreds. At 158th Street the cab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses.Throwing a regal homecoming glance around the neighbourhood, M rs Wilson gathered up her dog and her other purchases, and went haughtily in.

‘I'm going to have the McKees come up，'she announced as we rose in the elevator.‘And, of course, I got to call up my sister, too.'

The apartment was on the top floor-a small living-room, a small dining-room, a small bedroom, and a bath. The living-room was crowded to the doors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too large for it, so that to move about was to stumble continually over scenes of ladies swinging in the gardens of Versailles.The only picture was an over-enlarged photograph, apparently a hen sitting on a blurred rock.Looked at from a distance, however, the hen resolved itself into a bonnet, and the countenance of a stout old lady beamed down into the room.Several old copies of Town Tattle lay on the table together with a copy of Simon Called Peter, and some of the small scandal magazines of Broadway.Mrs Wilson was first concerned with the dog.A reluctant elevator-boy went for a box full of straw and some milk to which he added on his own initiative a tin of large, hard dog-biscuits-one of which decomposed apathetically in the saucer of milk all afternoon.Meanwhile Tom brought out a bottle of whiskey from a locked bureau drawer.

I have been drunk just twice in my life, and the second time was that afternoon；so everything that happened has a dim, hazy cast over it, although until after eight o'clock the apartment was full of cheerful sun. Sitting on Tom's lap Mrs Wilson called up several people on the telephone；then there were no cigarettes, and I went out to buy some at the drugstore on the comer.When I came back they had both disappeared, so I sat down discreetly in the living-room and read a chapter of Simon Called Peter-either it was terrible stuff or the whiskey distorted things, because it didn't make any sense to me.

Just as Tom and Myrtle（after the first drink Mrs Wilson and I called each other by our first names）reappeared, company commenced to arrive at the apartment-door.

The sister, Catherine, was a slender, worldly girl of about thirty, with a solid, sticky bob of red hair, and a complexion powdered milky white. Her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more rakish angle but the efforts of nature towards the restoration of the old alignment gave a blurred air to her face.When she moved about there was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets jingled up and down upon her arms.She came in with such a proprietary haste, and looked around so possessively at the furniture that I wondered if she lived here.But when I asked her she laughed immoderately, repeated my question aloud, and told me she lived with a girl friend at an hotel.

M r McKee was a pale, feminine man from the flat below. He had just shaved, for there was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone, and he was most respectful in his greeting to everyone in the room.He informed me that he was in the‘artistic game'，and I gathered later that he was a photographer and had made the dim enlargement of Mrs Wilson's mother which hovered like an ectoplasm on the wall.His wife was shrill, languid, handsome, and horrible.She told me with pride that her husband had photographed her a hundred and twenty-seven times since they had been married.

Mrs Wilson had changed her costume sometime before, and was now attired in an elaborate afternoon dress of cream-coloured chiffon, which gave out a continual rustle as she swept about the room. With the influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a change.The intense vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage was converted into impressive hauteur.Her laughter, her gestures, her assertions became more violently affected moment by moment, and as she expanded the room grew smaller around her, until she seemed to be revolving on a noisy, creaking pivot through the smoky air.

‘M y dear，'she told her sister in a high, mincing shout，‘most of these fellas will cheat you every time. All they think of is money.I had a woman up here last week to look at my feet, and when she gave me the bill you'd of thought she had my appendicitis out.'

‘What was the name of the woman?'asked Mrs McKee.'

‘Mrs Eberhardt. She goes around looking at people's feet in their own homes.'

‘I like your dress，'remarked Mrs McKee，‘I think it's adorable.

Mrs Wilson rejected the compliment by raising her eyebrow in disdain.

‘It's just a crazy old thing，'she said.‘I just slip it on sometimes when I don't care what I look like.'

‘But it looks wonderful on you, if you know what I mean，'pursued Mrs McKee.‘If Chester could only get you in that pose I think he could make something of it.'

We all looked in silence at Mrs Wilson, who removed a strand of hair from over her eyes and looked back at us with a brilliant smile. Mr McKee regarded her intently with his head on one side, and then moved his hand back and forth slowly in front of his face.

‘I should change the light，'he said after a moment.‘I'd like to bring out the modelling of the features. And I'd try to get hold of all the back hair.'

‘I wouldn't think of changing the light，'cried Mrs McKee.‘I think it's-'

Her husband said‘Sb！'and we all looked at the subject again， whereupon Tom Buchanan yawned audibly and got to his feet.

‘You McKees have something to drink，'he said.‘Get some more ice and mineral water, Myrtle, before everybody goes to sleep.'

‘I told that boy about the ice.'Myrtle raised her eyebrows in despair at the shiftlessness of the lower orders.‘These people！You have to keep after them all the time.'

She looked at me and laughed pointlessly. Then she flounced over to the dog, kissed it with ecstasy, and swept into the kitchen, implying that a dozen chefs awaited her orders there.

‘I've done some nice things out on Long Island，'asserted Mr McKee.

Tom looked at him blankly.

‘Two of them we have framed downstairs.'

‘Two what?'demanded Tom.

‘Two studies. One of them I call Montauk Point-The Gulls, and the other I call Montauk Point-The Sea.'

The sister Catherine sat down beside me on the couch.

‘Do you live down on Long Island, too?'she enquired.

‘I live at West Egg.'

‘Really?I was down there at a party about a month ago. At a man named Gatsby's.Do you know him?'

‘I live next door to him.'

‘Well, they say he's a nephew or a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm's. That's where all his money comes from.'

‘Really?'

She nodded.

‘I'm scared of him. I'd hate to have him get anything on me.'

This absorbing information about my neighbour was interrupted by Mrs McKee's pointing suddenly at Catherine：‘Chester, I think you could do something with her，'she broke out, but Mr McKee only nodded in a bored way, and turned his attention to Tom.

‘I'd like to do more work on Long Island, if I could get the entry. All I ask is that they should give me a start.'

‘Ask Myrtle，'said Tom, breaking into a short shout of laughter as Mrs Wilson entered with a tray.‘She'll give you a letter of introduction, won't you, Myrtle?'

‘Do what?'she asked, startled.

‘You'll give McKee a letter of introduction to your husband, so he can do some studies of him.'His lips moved silently for a moment as he invented.‘George B. Wilson at the Gasoline Pump, or something like that.'

Catherine leaned close to me and whispered in my ear：‘Neither of them can stand the person they're married to.'

‘Can't they?'

‘Can't stand them.'She looked at Myrtle and then at Tom.‘What I say is, why go on living with them if they can't stand them?If I was them I'd get a divorce and get married to each other right away.'

‘Doesn't she like Wilson either?'

The answer to this was unexpected. It came from Myrtle, who had overheard the question, and it was violent and obscene.

‘You see，'cried Catherine triumphantly. She lowered her voice again.‘It's really his wife that's keeping them apart.She's a Catholic, and they don't believe in divorce.’

Daisy was not a Catholic, and I was a little shocked at the elaborateness of the lie.

‘When they do get married，'continued Catherine，‘they're going West to live for a while until it blows over.'

‘It'd be more discreet to go to Europe.'

‘Oh, do you like Europe?'she exclaimed surprisingly.‘I just got back from Monte Carlo.'

‘Really.'

‘Just last year. I went over there with another girl.'

‘Stay long?'

‘No, we just went to Monte Carlo and back. We went by way of Marseilles.We had over twelve hundred dollars when we started, but we got gypped out of it all in two days in the private rooms.We had an awful time getting back, I can tell you.God, how I hated that town！'

The late afternoon sky bloomed in the window for a moment like the blue honey of the Mediterranean-then the shrill voice of Mrs McKee called me back into the room.

‘I almost made a mistake, too，'she declared vigorously.‘I almost married a little kike who'd been after me for years. I knew he was below me.Everybody kept saying tome：“Lucille, that man's way below you！”But if I hadn't met Chester, he'd of got me sure.’

‘Yes, but listen，'said Myrtle Wilson, nodding her head up and down，‘at least you didn't marry him.'

‘I know I didn't.'

‘Well, I married him，'said Myrtle, ambiguously.‘And that's the difference between your case and mine.'

‘Why did you, Myrtle?'demanded Catherine.‘Nobody forced you to.'

Myrtle considered.

‘I married him because I thought he was a gentleman，'she said finally.‘I thought he knew something about breeding, but he wasn't fit to lick my shoe.'

‘You were crazy about him for a while，'said Catherine.

‘Crazy about him！'cried Myrtle incredulously.‘Who said I was crazy about him?I never was any more crazy about him than I was about that man there.'

She pointed suddenly at me, and everyone looked at me accusingly. I tried to show by my expression that I expected no affection.

‘The only crazy I was was when I married him. I knew right away I made a mistake.He borrowed somebody's best suit to get married in, and never even told me about it, and the man came after it one day when he was out.“Oh, is that your suit?”I said.“This is the first I ever heard about it.”But I gave it to him and then I lay down and cried to beat the band all afternoon.'

‘She really ought to get away from him，'resumed Catherine to me.‘They've been living over that garage for eleven years. And Tom's the first sweetie she ever had.'

The bottle of whiskey-a second one-was now in constant demand by all present, excepting Catherine, who‘felt just as good on nothing at all'. Tom rang for the janitor and sent him for some celebrated sandwiches, which were a complete supper in themselves.I wanted to get out and walk eastward towards the park through the soft twilight, but each time I tried to go I became entangled in some wild, strident argument which pulled me back, as if with ropes, into my chair.Yet high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening streets, and I saw him too, looking up and wondering.I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.

Myrtle pulled her chair close to mine, and suddenly her warm breath poured over me the story of her first meeting with Tom.

‘It was on the two little seats facing each other that are always the last ones left on the train. I was going up to New York to see my sister and spend the night.He had on a dress suit and patent-leather shoes, and I couldn't keep my eyes off him, but every time he looked at me I had to pretend to be looking at the advertisement over his head.When we came into the station he was next to me, and his white shirt-front pressed against my arm, and so I told him I'd have to call a policeman, but he knew I lied.I was so excited that when I got into a taxi with him I didn't hardly know I wasn't getting into a subway train.All I kept thinking about, over and over, was，“You can't live forever；you can’t live forever.”’

She turned to Mrs McKee and the room rang full of her artificial laughter.

‘M y dear，'she cried，‘I'm going to give you this dress as soon as I'm through with it. I've got to get another one tomorrow.I'm going to make a list of all the things I’ve got to get.A massage and a wave, and a collar for the dog, and one of those cute little ashtrays where you touch a spring, and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother’s grave that’ll last all summer.I got to write down a list so I won’t forget all the things I got to do.’

It was nine o'clock-almost immediately afterwards I looked at my watch and found it was ten. M r McKee was asleep on a chair with his fists clenched in his lap, like a photograph of a man of action.Taking out my handkerchief I wiped from his cheek the spot of dried lather that had worried me all the afternoon.

The little dog was sitting on the table looking with blind eyes through the smoke, and from time to time groaning faintly. People disappeared, reappeared, made plans to go somewhere, and then lost each other, searched for each other, found each other a few feet away.Sometime towards midnight Tom Buchanan and Mrs Wilson stood face to face discussing, in impassioned voices, whether Mrs Wilson had any right to mention Daisy's name.

‘Daisy！Daisy！Daisy！'shouted Mrs Wilson.‘I'll say it whenever I want to！Daisy！Dai—'

Making a short deft movement, Tom Buchanan broke her nose with his open hand.

Then there were bloody towels upon the bathroom floor, and women's voices scolding, and high over the confusion a long broken wail of pain. M r McKee awoke from his doze and started in a daze towards the door.When he had gone halfway he turned around and stared at the scene-his wife and Catherine scolding and consoling as they stumbled here and there among the crowded furniture with articles of aid, and the despairing figure on the couch, bleeding fluently, and trying to spread a copy of Town Tattle over the tapestry scenes of Versailles.Then Mr McKee turned and continued on out the door.Taking my hat from the chandelier, I followed.

‘Come to lunch some day，'he suggested, as we groaned down in the elevator.

‘Where?'

‘Anywhere.'

‘Keep your hands off the lever，'snapped the elevator boy.

‘I beg your pardon，'said M r McKee with dignity，‘I didn't know I was touching it.'

‘All right，'I agreed，‘I'll be glad to.'

……I was standing beside his bed and he was sitting up between the sheets, clad in his underwear, with a great portfolio in his hands.

‘Beauty and the Beast……Loneliness……Old Grocery Horse……Brook'n Bridge……'

Then I was lying half-asleep in the cold lower level of the Pennsylvania Station, staring at the morning Tribune, and waiting for the four o'clock train.





CHAPTER 3


There was music from my neighbour's house through the summer nights. In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars.At high tide in the afternoon I watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft, or taking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motor­boats slit the waters of the Sound, drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of foam.On weekends his Rolls-Royce became an omnibus, bearing parties to and from the city between nine in the morning and long past midnight, while his station-wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to meet all trains.And on Mondays eight servants, including an extra gardener, toiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes and hammers and garden-shears, repairing the ravages of the night before.

Every Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a fruiterer in New York-every Monday these same oranges and lemons left his back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves. There was a machine in the kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in half an hour if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a butler's thumb.

At least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several hundred feet of canvas and enough coloured lights to make a Christmas tree of Gatsby's enormous garden. On buffet tables, garnished with glistening hordes oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold.In the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up, and stocked with gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that most of his female guests were too young to know one from another.

By seven o'clock the orchestra has arrived, no thin five-piece affair, but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and comets and piccolos, and low and high drums. The last swimmers have come in from the beach now and are dressing upstairs；the cars from New York are parked five deep in the drive, and already the halls and salons and verandas are gaudy with primary colours, and hair bobbed in strange new ways, and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile.The bar is in full swing, and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden outside, until the air is alive with chatter and laughter, and casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot, and enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other's names.

The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun, and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music, and the opera of voices pitches a key higher. Laughter is easier minute by minute, spilled with prodigality, tipped out at a cheerful word.The groups change more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the same breath；already there are wanderers, confident girls who weave here and there among the stouter and more stable, become for a sharp, joyous moment the centre of a group, and then, excited with triumph, glide on through the sea-change of faces and voices and colour under the constantly changing light.

Suddenly one of these gypsies, in trembling opal, seizes a cocktail out of the air, dumps it down for courage and, moving her hands like Frisco, dances out alone on the canvas platform. A momentary hush；the orchestra leader varies his rhythm obligingly for her, and there is a burst of chatter as the erroneous news goes around that she is Gilda Gray's understudy from the Follies.The party has begun.

I believe that on the first night I went to Gatsby's house I was one of the few guests who had actually been invited. People were not invited-they went there.They got into automobiles which bore them out to Long Island, and somehow they ended up at Gatsby's door.Once there they were introduced by somebody who knew Gatsby, and after that they conducted themselves according to the rules of behaviour associated with an amusement park.Sometimes they came and went without having met Gatsby at all, came for the party with a simplicity of heart that was its own ticket of admission.

I had been actually invited. A chauffeur in a uniform of robin's-egg blue crossed my lawn early that Saturday morning with a surprisingly formal note from his employer：the honour would be entirely Gatsby's, it said, if I would attend his little party'that night.He had seen me several times, and had intended to call on me long before, but a peculiar combination of circumstances had prevented it-signed Jay Gatsby, in a majestic hand.

Dressed up in white flannels I went over to his lawn a little while after seven, and wandered around rather ill at ease among swirls and eddies of people I didn't know-though here and there was a face I had noticed on the commuting train. I was immediately struck by the number of young Englishmen dotted about, all well dressed, all looking a little hungry, and all talking in low, earnest voices to solid and prosperous Americans.I was sure that they were selling something：bonds or insurance or automobiles.They were at least agonisingly aware of the easy money in the vicinity and convinced that it was theirs for a few words in the right key.

As soon as I arrived I made an attempt to find my host, but the two or three people of whom I asked his whereabouts stared at me in such an amazed way, and denied so vehemently any knowledge of his movements, that I slunk off in the direction of the cocktail table-the only place in the garden where a single man could linger without looking purposeless and alone.

I was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer embarrassment when Jordan Baker came out of the house and stood at the head of the marble steps, leaning a little backward and looking with contemptuous interest down into the garden.

Welcome or not, I found it necessary to attach myself to someone before I should begin to address cordial remarks to the passers-by.

‘Hello！'I roared, advancing towards her. M y voice seemed unnaturally loud across the garden.

‘I thought you might be here，'she responded absently as I came up.‘I remembered you lived next door to-'

She held my hand impersonally, as a promise that she'd take care of me in a minute, and gave ear to two girls in twin yellow dresses, who stopped at the foot of the steps.

‘Hello！'they cried together.‘Sorry you didn't win.'

That was for the golf tournament. She had lost in the finals the week before.

‘You don't know who we are，'said one of the girls in yellow，‘but we met you here about a month ago.'

‘You've dyed your hair since then，'remarked Jordan, and I started, but the girls had moved casually on and her remark was addressed to the premature moon, produced like the supper, no doubt, out of a caterer's basket. With Jordan's slender golden arm resting in mine, we descended the steps and sauntered about the garden.A tray of cocktails floated at us through the twilight, and we sat down at a table with the two girls in yellow and three men, each one introduced to us as Mr Mumble.

‘Do you come to these parties often?'enquired Jordan of the girl beside her.

‘The last one was the one I met you at，'answered the girl, in an alert confident voice. She turned to her companion：‘Wasn't it for you, Lucille?'

It was for Lucille, too.

‘I like to come，'Lucille said.‘I never care what I do, so I always have a good time. When I was here last I tore my gown on a chair, and he asked me my name and address-inside of a week I got a package from Croirier's with a new evening gown in it.'

‘Did you keep it?'askedJordan.

‘Sure I did. I was going to wear it tonight, but it was too big in the bust and had to be altered.It was gas blue and lavender beads.Two hundred and sixty-five dollars.'

‘There's something funny about a fellow that'll do a thing like that，'said the other girl eagerly.‘He doesn't want any trouble with anybody'

‘Who doesn't?'I enquired.

‘Gatsby. Some body told me-'

The two girls andJordan leaned together confidentially.

‘Somebody told me they thought he killed a man once.'

A thrill passed over all of us. The three Mr Mumbles bent forward and listened eagerly.

‘I don't think it's so much that?argued Lucille sceptically；‘it's more that he was a German spy during the war.'

One of the men nodded in confirmation.

‘I heard that from a man who knew all about him, grew up with him in Germany，'he assured us positively.

‘Oh, no，'said the first girl，‘it couldn't be that, because he was in the American army during the war.'As our credulity switched back to her she leaned forward with enthusiasm.‘You look at him sometimes when he thinks nobody's looking at him. I'll bet he killed a man.’

She narrowed her eyes and shivered. Lucille shivered.We all turned and looked around for Gatsby.It was testimony to the romantic specu­lation he inspired that there were whispers about him from those who had found little that it was necessary to whisper about in this world.

The first supper-there would be another one after midnight-was now being served, and Jordan invited me to join her own party, who were spread around a table on the other side of the garden. There were three married couples and Jordan's escort, a persistent undergraduate given to violent innuendo, and obviously under the impression that sooner or laterJordan was going to yield him up her person to a greater or lesser degree.Instead of rambling, this party had preserved a digni­fied homogeneity, and assumed to itself the function of representing the staid nobility of the countryside-East Egg condescending to West Egg, and carefully on guard against its spectroscopic gaiety.

‘Let's get out，'whispered Jordan, after a somehow wasteful and inappropriate half-hour；‘this is much too polite for me.'

We got up, and she explained that we were going to find the host：I had never met him, she said, and it was making me uneasy. The undergraduate nodded in a cynical, melancholy way.

The bar, where we glanced first, was crowded, but Gatsby was not there. She couldn't find him from the top of the steps, and he wasn't on the veranda.On a chance we tried an important-looking door, and walked into a high Gothic library, panelled with carved English oak, and probably transported complete from some ruin overseas.

A stout, middle-aged man, with enormous owl-eyed spectacles, was sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table, staring with unsteady concentration at the shelves of books. As we entered he wheeled excitedly around and examined Jordan from head to foot.

‘What do you think?'he demanded impetuously.

‘About what?'

He waved his hand towards the bookshelves.

‘About that. As a matter of fact you needn't bother to ascertain.I ascertained.They're real.'

‘The books?'

He nodded.

‘Absolutely real-have pages and everything. I thought they'd be a nice durable cardboard.Matter of fact, they're absolutely real.Pages and-Here！Lemme show you.'

Taking our scepticism for granted, he rushed to the bookcases and returned with Volume One of the‘Stoddard Lectures'.

‘See！'he cried triumphantly.‘It's a bona-fide piece of printed matter. It fooled me.This fella's a regular Belasco.It's a triumph.What thoroughness！What realism！Knew when to stop, too-didn't cut the pages.But what do you want?What do you expect?’

He snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on its shelf, muttering that if one brick was removed the whole library was liable to collapse.

‘Who brought you?'he demanded.‘Or did you just come?I was brought. Most people were brought.'

Jordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully, without answering.

‘I was brought by a woman named Roosevelt，'he continued.‘Mrs Claude Roosevelt. Do you know her?I met her somewhere last night.I've been drunk for about a week now, and I thought it might sober me up to sit in a library.'

‘Has it?'

‘A little bit, I think. I can't tell yet.I've only been here an hour.Did I tell you about the books?They're real.They're-'

‘You told us.'

We shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors.

There was dancing now on the canvas in the garden；old men pushing young girls backwards in eternal graceless circles, superior couples holding each other tortuously, fashionably, and keeping in the comers-and a great number of single girls dancing individualistically or relieving the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or the traps. By midnight the hilarity had increased.A celebrated tenor had sung in Italian, and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz, and between the numbers people were doing‘stunts'all over the garden, while happy, vacuous bursts of laughter rose towards the summer sky.A pair of stage twins, who turned out to be the girls in yellow, did a baby act in costume, and champagne was served in glasses bigger than finger-bowls.The moon had risen higher, and floating in the Sound was a triangle of silver scales, trembling a little to the stiff, tinny drip of the banjoes on the lawn.

I was still with Jordan Baker. We were sitting at a table with a man of about my age and a rowdy little girl, who gave way upon the slightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter.I was enjoying myself now.I had taken two finger-bowls of champagne, and the scene had changed before my eyes into something significant, elemental and profound.

At a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled.

‘Your face is familiar，'he said, politely.‘Weren't you in the First Division during the war?'

‘Why, yes. I was in the Twenty-eighth Infantry.'

‘I was in the Sixteenth until June 1918. I knew I'd seen you somewhere before.'

We talked for a moment about some wet, grey little villages in France. Evidently he lived in this vicinity, for he told me that he had just bought a hydroplane, and was going to try it out in the morning.

‘Want to go with me, old sport?Just near the shore along the Sound.'

‘What time?'

‘Any time that suits you best.'

It was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when Jordan looked around and smiled.

‘Having a gay time now?'she enquired.

‘Much better.'I turned again to my new acquaintance.‘This is an unusual party for me. I haven't even seen the host.I live over there-'I waved my hand at the invisible hedge in the distance，‘and this man Gatsby sent over his chauffeur with an invitation.'

For a moment he looked at me as if he failed to understand.

‘I'm Gatsby，'he said suddenly.

‘What！'I exclaimed.‘Oh, I beg your pardon.'

‘I thought you knew, old sport. I'm afraid I'm not a very good host.'

He smiled understandingly-much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life.It faced-or seemed to face-the whole eternal world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favour.It understood you just as far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the impres­sion of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey.Precisely at that point it vanished-and I was looking at an elegant young roughneck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd.Sometime before he introduced himself I'd got a strong impression that he was picking his words with care.

Almost at the moment when Mr Gatsby identified himself, a butler hurried towards him with the information that Chicago was calling him on the wire. He excused himself with a small bow that included each of us in turn.

‘If you want anything just ask for it, old sport，'he urged me.‘Excuse me. I will rejoin you later.'

When he was gone I turned immediately to Jordan-constrained to assure her of my surprise. I had expected that M r Gatsby would be a florid and corpulent person in his middle years.

‘Who is he?'I demanded.‘Do you know?'

‘He's just a man named Gatsby.'

‘Where is he from, I mean?And what does he do?'

‘Now you're started on the subject，'she answered with a wan smile.‘Well, he told me once he was an Oxford man.'

A dim background started to take shape behind him, but at her next remark it faded away.

‘However, I don't believe it.'

‘Why not?'

‘I don't know，'she insisted，‘I just don't think he went there.'

Something in her tone reminded me of the other girl's‘I think he killed a man'，and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity. I would have accepted without question the information that Gatsby sprang from the swamps of Louisiana or from the lower East Side of New York.That was comprehensible.But young men didn't-at least in my provincial inexperience I believed they didn't-drift coolly out of nowhere and buy a palace on Long Island Sound.

‘Anyhow, he gives large parties，'said Jordan, changing the subject with an urban taste for the concrete.‘And I like large parties. They're so intimate.At small parties there isn't any privacy.'

There was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice of the orchestra leader rang out suddenly above the echolalia of the garden.

‘Ladies and gentlemen，'he cried.‘At the request of Mr Gatsby we are going to play for you Mr Vladimir Tostoff's latest work, which attracted so much attention at Carnegie Hall last May. If you read the papers, you know there was a big sensation.'He smiled with jovial condescen-sion, and added：‘Some sensation！'Whereupon everybody laughed.

‘The piece is known，'he concluded lustily，‘as Vladimir TostofPs Jazz History ofthe World'

The nature of Mr Tostoff's composition eluded me, because just as it began my eyes fell on Gatsby, standing alone on the marble steps and looking from one group to another with approving eyes. His tanned skin was drawn attractively tight on his face and his short hair looked as though it were trimmed every day.I could see nothing sinister about him.I won­dered if the fact that he was not drinking helped to set him off from his guests, for it seemed to me that he grew more correct as the fraternal hilarity increased.When f a z z History ofthe Worldwas over, girls were putting their heads on men's shoulders in a puppyish, convivial way, girls were swooning backward playfully into men's arms, even into groups, knowing that someone would arrest their falls-but no one swooned backward on Gatsby, and no French bob touched Gatsby's shoulder, and no singing quartets were formed with Gatsby's head for one link.

‘I beg your pardon.'

Gatsby's butler was suddenly standing beside us.

‘Miss Baker?'he enquired.‘I beg your pardon, but M r Gatsby would like to speak to you alone.'

‘With me?'she exclaimed in surprise.

‘Yes, madame.'

She got up slowly, raising her eyebrows at me in astonishment, and followed the butler towards the house. I noticed that she wore her evening-dress, all her dresses, like sports clothes-there was a jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to walk upon golf courses on clean, crisp mornings.

I was alone and it was almost two. For some time confused and intriguing sounds had issued from a long, many-windowed room which overhung the terrace.Eluding Jordan's undergraduate, who was now engaged in an obstetrical conversation with two chorus girls, and who implored me to join him, I went inside.

The large room was full of people. One of the girls in yellow was playing the piano, and beside her stood a tall, red-haired young lady from a famous chorus, engaged in song.She had drunk a quantity of champagne, and during the course of her song she had decided, ineptly, that everything was very, very sad-she was not only singing, she was weeping too.Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with gasping, broken sobs, and then took up the lyric again in a quavering soprano.The tears coursed down her cheeks-not freely, however, for when they came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed an inky colour, and pursued the rest of their way in slow black rivulets.A humorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes on her face, whereupon she threw up her hands, sank into a chair, and went off into a deep vinous sleep.

‘She had a fight with a man who says he's her husband，'explained a girl at my elbow.

I looked around. Most of the remaining women were now having fights with men said to be their husbands.Even Jordan's party, the quartet from East Egg, were rent asunder by dissension.One of the men was talking with curious intensity to a young actress, and his wife, after attempting to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent way, broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacks-at intervals she appeared suddenly at his side like an angry diamond, and hissed：‘You promised！'into his ear.

The reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward men. The hall was at present occupied by two deplorably sober men and their highly indignant wives.The wives were sympathising with each other in slightly raised voices.

‘Whenever he sees I'm having a good time he wants to go home.'

‘Never heard anything so selfish in my life.'

‘W e're always the first ones to leave.'

‘So are we.'

‘Well, we're almost the last tonight，'said one of the men sheepishly.‘The orchestra left half an hour ago.'

In spite of the wives'agreement that such malevolence was beyond credibility, the dispute ended in a short struggle, and both wives were lifted, kicking, into the night.

As I waited for my hat in the hall the door of the library opened and Jordan Baker and Gatsby came out together. He was saying some last word to her, but the eagerness in his manner tightened abruptly into formality as several people approached him to say goodbye.

Jordan's party were calling impatiently to her from the porch, but she lingered for a moment to shake hands.

‘I've just heard the most amazing thing，'she whispered.‘How long were we in there?'

‘Why, about an hour.'

‘It was……simply amazing，'she repeated abstractedly.‘But I swore I wouldn't tell it and here I am tantalising you.'She yawned gracefully in my face.‘Please come and see me……Phone book……Under the name ofMrs Sigourney Howard……M y aunt……'She was hurrying off as she talked-her brown hand waved a jaunty salute as she melted into her party at the door.

Rather ashamed that on my first appearance I had stayed so late, I joined the last of Gatsby's guests, who were clustered around him. I wanted to explain that I'd hunted for him early in the evening and to apologise for not having known him in the garden.

‘Don't mention it，'he enjoined me eagerly.‘Don't give it another thought, old sport.'The familiar expression held no more familiarity than the hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder.‘And don't forget we’re going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning, at nine o’clock.’

Then the butler, behind his shoulder：‘Philadelphia wants you on the phone, sir.'

‘All right, in a minute. Tell them I'll be right there……Good-night.'

‘Good-night.'

‘Good-night.'He smiled-and suddenly there seemed to be a pleasant significance in having been among the last to go, as if he had desired it all the time.‘Good-night, old sport……Good-night.'

But as I walked down the steps I saw that the evening was not quite over. Fifty feet from the door a dozen headlights illuminated a bizarre and tumultuous scene.In the ditch beside the road, right side up, but violently shorn of one wheel, rested a new coupe which had left Gatsby's drive not two minutes before.The sharp jut of a wall accounted for the detachment of the wheel, which was now getting considerable attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs.However, as they had left their cars blocking the road, a harsh, discordant din from those in the rear had been audible for some time, and added to the already violent confusion of the scene.

A man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in the middle of the road, looking from the car to the tyre and from the tyre to the observers in a pleasant, puzzled way.

‘See！'he explained.‘It went in the ditch.'

The fact was infinitely astonishing to him, and I recognised first the unusual quality of wonder, and then the man-it was the late patron of Gatsby's library.

‘How'd it happen?'

He shrugged his shoulders.

‘I know nothing whatever about mechanics，'he said decisively.

‘But how did it happen?Did you run into the wall?'

‘Don't ask me，'said Owl Eyes, washing his hands of the whole matter.‘I know very little about driving-next to nothing. It happened, and that's all I know.'

‘Well, if you're a poor driver you oughtn't to try driving at night.'

‘But I wasn't even trying，'he explained indignantly，‘I wasn't even trying.'

An awed hush fell upon the bystanders.

‘Do you want to commit suicide?'

‘You're lucky it was just a wheel！A bad driver and not even drying！'

‘You don't understand，'explained the criminal.‘I wasn't driving. There's another man in the car.'

The shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained‘Ah-h-h！'as the door of the coupe swung slowly open. The crowd-it was now a crowd-stepped back involuntarily, and when the door had opened wide there was a ghostly pause.Then, very gradually, part by part, a pale, dangling individual stepped out of the wreck, pawing tentatively at the ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe.

Blinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant groaning of the horns, the apparition stood swaying for a moment before he perceived the man in the duster.

‘W hat's matter?'he enquired calmly.‘Did we run out of gas?'

‘Look！'

H aifa dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheel-he stared at it for a moment, and then looked upward as though he suspected that it had dropped from the sky.

‘It came off，'someone explained.

He nodded.

‘At first I didn't notice we'd stopped.'

A pause. Then, taking a long breath and straightening his shoulders, he remarked in a determined voice：‘Wonder tell me where there's a gasaline station?'

At least a dozen men, some of them a litde better off than he was, explained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any physical bond.

‘Back out，'he suggested after a moment.‘Put her in reverse.'

‘But the wheel's off！'

He hesitated.

‘No harm in trying，'he said.

The caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and I turned away and cut across the lawn towards home. I glanced back once.A wafer of a moon was shining over Gatsby's house, making the night fine as before, and surviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden.A sudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great doors, endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host, who stood on the porch, his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell.

Reading over what I have written so far, I see I have given the impression that the events of three nights several weeks apart were all that absorbed me. On the contrary, they were merely casual events in a crowded summer, and, until much later, they absorbed me infinitely less than my personal affairs.

Most of the time I worked. In the early morning the sun threw my shadow westward as I hurried down the white chasms of lower New York to the Probity Trust.I knew the other clerks and young bond-salesmen by their first names, and lunched with them in dark, crowded restaurants on little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee.I even had a short affair with a girl who lived in Jersey City and worked in the accounting department, but her brother began throwing mean looks in my direction, so when she went on her vacation in July I let it blow quietly away.

I took dinner usually at the Yale Club-for some reason it was the gloomiest event of my day-and then I went upstairs to the library and studied investments and securities for a conscientious hour. There were generally a few rioters around, but they never came into the library, so it was a good place to work.After that, if the night was mellow, I strolled down Madison Avenue past the old Murray Hill Hotel, and over 33rd Street to the Pennsylvania Station.

I began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night, and the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and machines gives to the restless eye. I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue and pick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few minutes I was going to enter into their lives, and no one would ever know or disapprove.Sometimes, in my mind, I followed them to their apartments on the comers of hidden streets, and they turned and smiled back at me before they faded through a door into warm darkness.At the enchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes, and felt it in others-poor young clerks who loitered in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinner-young clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poignant moments of night and life.

Again at eight o'clock, when the dark lanes of the Forties were lined five deep with throbbing taxicabs, bound for the theatre district, I felt a sinking in my heart. Forms leaned together in the taxis as they waited, and voices sang, and there was laughter from unheard jokes, and lighted cigarettes made unintelligible circles inside.Imagining that I, too, was hurrying towards gaiety and sharing their intimate excitement, I wished them well.

For a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker, and then in midsummer I found her again. At first I was flattered to go places with her, because she was a golf champion, and everyone knew her name.Then it was something more.I wasn't actually in love, but I felt a sort of tender curiosity.The bored haughty face that she turned to the world concealed something-most affectations conceal something eventually, even though they don't in the beginning-and one day I found what it was.When we were on a house-party together up in Warwick, she left a borrowed car out in the rain with the top down, and then lied about it-and suddenly I remembered the story about her that had eluded me that night at Daisy's.At her first big golf tournament there was a row that nearly reached the newspapers-a suggestion that she had moved her ball from a bad lie in the semi-final round.The thing approached the proportions of a scandal-then died away.A caddy retracted his statement, and the only other witness admitted that he might have been mistaken.The incident and the name had remained together in my mind.

Jordan Baker instinctively avoided clever, shrewd men, and now I saw that this was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergence from a code would be thought impossible. She was incurably dishonest.She wasn't able to endure being at a disadvantage and, given this unwillingness, I suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she was very young in order to keep that cool, insolent smile turned to the world and yet satisfy the demands of her hard, jaunty body.

It made no difference to me. Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you never blame deeply-I was casually sorry, and then I forgot.It was on that same house-party that we had a curious conversation about driving a car.It started because she passed so close to some workmen that our fender flicked a button on one man's coat.

‘You're a rotten driver，'I protested.‘Either you ought to be more careful, or you oughtn't to drive at all.'

‘I am careful.'

‘No, you're not.'

‘Well, other people are，'she said lightly.

‘What's that got to do with it?'

‘They'll keep out of my way，'she insisted.‘It takes two to make an accident.'

‘Suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself.'

‘I hope I never will，'she answered.‘I hate careless people. That's why I like you.'

Her grey, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but she had deliberately shifted our relations, and for a moment I thought I loved her. But I am slow-thinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes on my desires, and I knew that first I had to get myself definitely out of that tangle back home.I'd been writing letters once a week and signing them：‘Love, Nick'，and all I could think of was how, when that certain girl played tennis, a faint moustache of perspiration appeared on her upper lip.Nevertheless there was a vague understanding that had to be tactfully broken off before I was free.

Everyone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine：I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.





CHAPTER 4


On Sunday morning while church bells rang in the villages along-shore, the world and its mistress returned to Gatsby's house and twinkled hilariously on his lawn.

‘He's a bootlegger，'said the young ladies, moving somewhere between his cocktails and his flowers.‘One time he killed a man who had found out that he was nephew to Von Hindenburg and second cousin to the devil. Reach me a rose, honey, and pour me a last drop into that there crystal glass.'

Once I wrote down on the empty spaces of a timetable the names of those who came to Gatsby's house that summer. It is an old timetable now, disintegrating at its folds, and headed，‘This schedule in effect July 5th，1922'.But I can still read the grey names, and they will give you a better impression than my generalities of those who accepted Gatsby's hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute of knowing nothing whatever about him.

From East Egg, then, came the Chester Beckers and the Leeches, and a man named Bunsen, whom I knew at Yale, and Doctor Webster Civet, who was drowned last summer up in Maine. And the Hornbeams and the Willie Voltaires, and a whole clan named Blackbuck, who always gathered in a corner and flipped up their noses like goats at whosoever came near.And the Ismays and the Chrysties （or rather Hubert Auerbach and M r Chrystie's wife），and Edgar Beaver, whose hair, they say, turned cotton-white one winter afternoon for no good reason at all.

Clarence Endive was from East Egg, as I remember. He came only once, in white knickerbockers, and had a fight with a bum named Etty in the garden.From farther out on the Island came the Cheadles and the O.R.P.Schraeders, and the StonewallJackson Abrams of Georgia, and the Fishguards and the Ripley Snells.Snell was there three days before he went to the penitentiary, so drunk out on the gravel drive that Airs Ulysses Swett's automobile ran over his right hand.The Dancies came, too, and S.B.Whitebait, who was well over sixty, and Maurice A.Flink, and the Hammerheads, and Beluga the tobacco importer, and Beluga's girls.

From West Egg came the Poles and the Mulreadys and Cecil Roebuck and Cecil Schoen and Gulick the State senator and Newton Orchid, who controlled Films Par Excellence, and Eckhaust and Clyde Cohen and Don S. Schwartze（the son）and Arthur McCarty, all connected with the movies in one way or another.And the Catlips and the Bembergs and G.Earl Muldoon, brother to that Muldoon who afterwards strangled his wife.Da Fontano the promoter came there, and Ed Legros and James B.（‘Rot-Gut'）Ferret and the De Jongs and Ernest Lilly-they came to gamble, and when Ferret wandered into the garden it meant he was cleaned out and Associated Traction would have to fluctuate profitably next day.

A man named Klipspringer was there so often and so long that he became known as‘the boarder'-I doubt if he had any other home. Of theatrical people there were Gus Waize and Horace O'Donavan and Lester Myer and George Duckweed and Francis Bull.Also from New York were the Chromes and the Backhyssons and the Dennickers and Russell Betty and the Corrigans and the Kellehers and the Dewers and the Scullys and S.W.Belcher and the Smirkes and the young Quinns, divorced now, and Henry L.Palmetto, who killed himself by jumping in front of a subway train in Times Square.

Benny McClenahan arrived always with four girls. They were never quite the same ones in physical person, but they were so identical one with another that it inevitably seemed that they had been there before.I have forgotten their names-Jacqueline, I think, or else Consuela, or Gloria orJudy orJune, and their last names were either the melodious names of flowers and months or the sterner ones of the great Ameri­can capitalists whose cousins, if pressed, they would confess themselves to be.

In addition to all these I can remember that Faustina O'Brien came there at least once and the Baedeker girls and young Brewer, who had his nose shot off in the war, and M r Albrucksburger and Miss Haag, his fiancee, and Ardita Fitz-Peters and M r P. Jewett, once head of the American Legion, and Miss Claudia Hip, with a man reputed to be her chauffeur, and a prince of something, whom we called Duke, and whose name, if I ever knew it, I have forgotten.

All these people came to Gatsby's house in the summer.

At nine o'clock, one morning late in July, Gatsby's gorgeous car lurched up the rocky drive to my door and gave out a burst of melody from its three-noted horn. It was the first time he had called on me, though I had gone to two of his parties, mounted in his hydroplane, and, at his urgent invitation, made frequent use of his beach.

‘Good-morning, old sport. You're having lunch with me today and I thought we'd ride up together.'

He was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car with the resourcefulness of movement that is so peculiarly American-that comes, I suppose, with the absence of lifting work in youth and, even more, with the formless grace of our nervous, sporadic games. This quality was continually breaking through his punctilious manner in the shape of restlessness.He was never quite still；there was always a tapping foot somewhere or the impatient opening and closing of a hand.

He saw me looking with admiration at his car.

‘It's pretty, isn't it, old sport?'He jumped off to give me a better view.‘Haven't you ever seen it before?'

I'd seen it. Everybody had seen it.It was a rich cream colour, bright with nickel, swollen here and there in its monstrous length with triumphant hat-boxes and supper-boxes and tool-boxes, and terraced with a labyrinth of wind-shields that mirrored a dozen suns.Sitting down behind many layers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory, we started to town.

I had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the past month and found, to my disappointment, that he had little to say. So my first impression, that he was a person of some undefined consequence, had gradually faded and he had become simply the proprietor of an elaborate roadhouse next door.

And then came that disconcerting ride. We hadn't reached West Egg Village before Gatsby began leaving his elegant sentences unfinished and slapping himself indecisively on the knee of his caramel-coloured suit.

‘Look here, old sport，'he broke out surprisingly，‘what's your opinion of me, anyhow?'

A little overwhelmed, I began the generalised evasions which that question deserves.

‘Well, I'm going to tell you something about my life，'he interrupted.‘I don't want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you hear.'

So he was aware of the bizarre accusations that flavoured conversa­tion in his halls.

‘I'll tell you God's truth.'His right hand suddenly ordered divine retribution to stand by.‘I am the son of some wealthy people in the Middle West-all dead now. I was brought up in America but educated at Oxford, because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years.It is a family tradition.'

He looked at me sideways-and I knew why Jordan Baker had believed he was lying. He hurried the phrase‘educated at Oxford'，or swallowed it, or choked on it, as though it had bothered him before.And with this doubt, his whole statement fell to pieces, and I wondered if there wasn't something a little sinister about him, after all.

‘What part of the Middle West?'I inquired casually.

‘San Francisco.'

‘I see.'

‘M y family all died and I came into a good deal of money.'

His voice was solemn, as if the memory of that sudden extinction of a clan still haunted him. For a moment I suspected that he was pulling my leg, but a glance at him convinced me otherwise.

‘After that I lived like a young rajah in all the capitals of Europe-Paris, Venice, Rome-collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting big game, painting a little, things for myself only, and trying to forget something very sad that had happened to me long ago.'

With an effort I managed to restrain my incredulous laughter. The very phrases were worn so threadbare that they evoked no image except that of a turbaned‘character'leaking sawdust at every pore as he pursued a tiger through the Bois de Boulogne.

‘Then came the war, old sport. It was a great relief, and I tried very hard to die, but I seemed to bear an enchanted life.I accepted a commission as first lieutenant when it began.In the Argonne Forest I took the remains of my machine-gun battalion so far forward that there was a half-mile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldn't advance.We stayed there two days and two nights, a hundred and thirty men with sixteen Lewis guns, and when the infantry came up at last they found the insignia of three German divisions among the piles of dead.I was promoted to be a major, and every Allied government gave me a decoration-even Montenegro, little Montenegro down on the Adriatic Sea！'

Little Montenegro！He lifted up the words and nodded at them-with his smile. The smile comprehended Montenegro's troubled history and sympathised with the brave struggles of the Montenegrin people.It appreciated fully the chain of national circumstances which had elicited this tribute from Montenegro's warm little heart.M y incredulity was submerged in fascination now；it was like skimming hastily through a dozen magazines.

He reached in his pocket, and a piece of metal, slung on a ribbon, fell into my palm.

‘That's the one from Montenegro.'

To my astonishment, the thing had an authentic look.‘Orderi di Danilo，'ran the circular legend，‘Montenegro, Nicolas Rex.'

‘Turn it.'

‘Major Jay Gatsby，'I read，‘For Valour Extraordinary.'

‘Here's another thing I always carry. A souvenir of Oxford days.It was taken in Trinity Quad-the man on my left is now the Earl of Doncaster.'

It was a photograph of half a dozen young men in blazers loafing in an archway through which were visible a host of spires. There was Gatsby, looking a little, not much, younger-with a cricket bat in his hand.

Then it was all true. I saw the skins of tigers flaming in his palace on the Grand Canal；I saw him opening a chest of rubies to ease, with their crimson-lighted depths, the gnawings of his broken heart.

‘I'm going to make a big request of you today，'he said, pocketing his souvenirs with satisfaction，‘so I thought you ought to know something about me. I didn't want you to think I was just some nobody.You see, I usually find myself among strangers because I drift here and there trying to forget the sad thing that happened to me.'He hesitated.‘You'll hear about it this afternoon.’

‘At lunch?'

‘No, this afternoon. I happened to find out that you're taking Miss Baker to tea.'

‘Do you mean you're in love with Miss Baker?'

‘No, old sport, I'm not. But Miss Baker has kindly consented to speak to you about this matter.'

I hadn't the faintest idea what‘this matter'was, but I was more annoyed than interested. I hadn't askedJordan to tea in order to discuss Mr Jay Gatsby.I was sure the request would be something utterly fantastic, and for a moment I was sorry I'd ever set foot upon his overpopulated lawn.

He wouldn't say another word. His correctness grew on him as we neared the city.We passed Port Roosevelt, where there was a glimpse of red-belted ocean-going ships, and sped along a cobbled slum lined with the dark, undeserted saloons of the faded-gilt nineteen-hundreds.Then the valley of ashes opened out on both sides of us, and I had a glimpse of Mrs Wilson straining at the garage pump with panting vitality as we went by.

With fenders spread like wings we scattered light through half Astoria-only half, for as we twisted among the pillars of the elevated I heard the familiar‘jug-jug-spat！'of a motorcycle, and a frantic policeman rode alongside.

‘All right, old sport，'called Gatsby. We slowed down.Taking a white card from his wallet, he waved it before the man's eyes.

‘Right you are，'agreed the policeman, tipping his cap.‘Know you next time, Mr Gatsby. Excuse me！'

‘What was that?'I enquired.‘The picture of Oxford?'

‘I was able to do the commissioner a favour once, and he sends me a Christmas card every year.'

Over the great bridge, with the sunlight through the girders making a constant flicker upon the moving cars, with the city rising up across the river in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of non-olfactory money. The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world.

A dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with blooms, followed by two carriages with drawn blinds, and by more cheerful carriages for friends. The friends looked out at us with the tragic eyes and short upper lips of south-eastern Europe, and I was glad that the sight of Gatsby's splendid car was included in their sombre holiday.As we crossed Blackwell's Island a limousine passed us, driven by a white chauffeur, in which sat three modish negroes, two bucks and a girl.I laughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled towards us in haughty rivalry.

‘Anything can happen now that we've slid over this bridge，'I thought；‘anything at all……'

Even Gatsby could happen, without any particular wonder.

Roaring noon. In a well-fanned Forty-second Street cellar I met Gatsby for lunch.Blinking away the brightness of the street outside, my eyes picked him out obscurely in the ante-room, talking to another man.

‘M r Carraway, this is my friend M r Wolfsheim.'

A small, flat-nosed Jew raised his large head and regarded me with two fine growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril. After a moment I discovered his tiny eyes in the half-darkness.

‘-So I took one look at him，'said M r Wolfsheim, shaking my hand earnestly，‘and what do you think I did?'

‘What?'I enquired politely.

But evidently he was not addressing me, for he dropped my hand and covered Gatsby with his expressive nose.

‘I handed the money to Katspaugh and I said：“All right, Katspaugh, don't pay him a penny till he shuts his mouth.”He shut it then and there.'

Gatsby took an arm of each of us and moved forward into the restaurant, whereupon M r Wolfsheim swallowed a new sentence he was starting and lapsed into a somnambulatory abstraction.

‘Highballs?'asked the head waiter.

‘This is a nice restaurant here，'said M r Wolfsheim, looking at the Presbyterian nymphs on the ceiling.‘But I like across the street better！'

‘Yes, highballs，'agreed Gatsby, and then to M r Wolfsheim：‘It's too hot over there.'

‘Hot and small-yes，'said Mr Wolfsheim，‘but full of memories.'

‘What place is that?'I asked.

‘The old Metropole.'

‘The old Metropole，'brooded Mr Wolfsheim gloomily.‘Filled with faces dead and gone. Filled with friends gone now for ever.I can't forget so long as I live the night they shot Rosy Rosenthal there.It was six of us at the table, and Rosy had ate and drunk a lot all evening.

When it was almost morning the waiter came up to him with a funny look and says somebody wants to speak to him outside.“All right，”says Rosy, and begins to get up, and I pulled him down in his chair.

‘“Let the bastards come in here if they want you, Rosy, but don't you, so help me, move outside this room.”'

‘It was four o'clock in the morning then, and if we'd of raised the blinds we'd of seen daylight.'

‘Did he go?'I asked innocently.

‘Sure he went.'Mr Wolfsheim's nose flashed at me indignantly.‘He turned around in the door and says：“Don't let that waiter take away my coffee！”Then he went out on the sidewalk, and they shot him three times in his full belly and drove away.'

‘Four of them were electrocuted，'I said, remembering.

‘Five, with Becker.'His nostrils turned to me in an interested way.‘I understand you're looking for a business gonnegtion.'

The juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling. Gatsby answered for me：

‘Oh, no，'he exclaimed，‘this isn't the man.'

‘No?'M r Wolfsheim seemed disappointed.

‘This is just a friend. I told you we'd talk about that some other time.'

‘I beg your pardon，'said Mr Wolfsheim，‘I had a wrong man.'

A succulent hash arrived, and Mr Wolfsheim, forgetting the more sentimental atmosphere of the old Metropole, began to eat with ferocious delicacy. His eyes, meanwhile, roved very slowly all around the room-he completed the arc by turning to inspect the people directly behind.I think that, except for my presence, he would have taken one short glance beneath our own table.

‘Look here, old sport，'said Gatsby leaning towards me，‘I'm afraid I made you a little angry this morning in the car.'

There was the smile again, but this time I held out against it.

‘I don't like mysteries，'I answered，‘and I don't understand why you won't come out frankly and tell me what you want. Why has it all got to come through Miss Baker?'

‘Oh, it's nothing underhand，'he assured me.‘Miss Baker's a great sportswoman, you know, and she'd never do anything that wasn't all right.’

Suddenly he looked at his watch, jumped up, and hurried from the room, leaving me with M r Wolfsheim at the table.

‘He has to telephone，'said Mr Wolfsheim, following him with his eyes.‘Fine fellow, isn't he?Handsome to look at and a perfect gentleman.'

‘Yes.'

‘He's an Oggsford man.'

‘Oh！'

‘He went to Oggsford College in England. You know Oggsford College?'

‘I've heard of it.'

‘It's one of the most famous colleges in the world.'

‘Have you known Gatsby for a long time?'I enquired.

‘Several years，'he answered in a gratified way.‘I made the pleasure of his acquaintance just after the war. But I knew I had discovered a man of fine breeding after I talked with him an hour.I said to myself：“There's the kind of man you'd like to take home and introduce to your mother and sister.”'He paused.‘I see you're looking at my cuff buttons.’

I hadn't been looking at them, but I did now. They were composed of oddly familiar pieces of ivory.

‘Finest specimens of human molars，'he informed me.

‘Well！'I inspected them.‘That's a very interesting idea.'

‘Yeah.'He flipped his sleeves up under his coat.‘Yeah, Gatsby's very careful about women. He would never so much as look at a friend's wife.'

When the subject of this instinctive trust returned to the table and sat down, Mr Wolfsheim drank his coffee with a jerk and got to his feet.

‘I have enjoyed my lunch，'he said，‘and I'm going to run off from you two young men before I outstay my welcome.'

‘Don't hurry, Meyer，'said Gatsby, without enthusiasm. Mr Wolfsheim raised his hand in a sort of benediction.

‘You're very polite, but I belong to another generation，'he announced solemnly.‘You sit here and discuss your sports and your young ladies and your-'He supplied an imaginary noun with another wave of his hand.‘As for me, I am fifty years old, and I won't impose myself on you any longer.'

As he shook hands and turned away his tragic nose was trembling. I wondered if I had said anything to offend him.

‘He becomes very sentimental sometimes，'explained Gatsby.‘This is one of his sentimental days. He's quite a character around New York-a denizen of Broadway.'

‘Who is he, anyhow, an actor?'

‘No.'

‘A dentist?'

‘Meyer Wolfsheim?No, he's a gambler.'Gatsby hesitated, then added coolly：‘He's the man who fixed the World's Series back in 1 919.'

‘Fixed the World's Series?'I repeated.

The idea staggered me. I remembered, of course, that the World's Series had been fixed in 1 91 9，but if I had thought of it at all I would have thought of it as a thing that merely happened, the end of some inevitable chain.It never occurred to me that one man could start to play with the faith of fifty million people-with the single-mindedness of a burglar blowing a safe.

‘How did he happen to do that?'I asked after a minute.

‘He just saw the opportunity.'

‘Why isn't he in jail?'

‘They can't get him, old sport. He's a smart man.'

I insisted on paying the check. As the waiter brought my change I caught sight of Tom Buchanan across the crowded room.

‘Come along with me for a minute，'I said；‘I've got to say hello to someone.'

When he saw us Tom jumped up and took half a dozen steps in our direction.

‘Where've you been?'he demanded eagerly.‘Daisy's furious because you haven't called up.'

‘This is M r Gatsby, Mr Buchanan.'

They shook hands briefly, and a strained, unfamiliar look of embarrassment came over Gatsby's face.

‘How've you been, anyhow?'demanded Tom of me.‘How'd you happen to come up this far to eat?'

‘I've been having lunch with Mr Gatsby.'

I turned towards M r Gatsby, but he was no longer there.

One October day in 1917-（said Jordan Baker that afternoon, sitting up very straight on a straight chair in the tea-garden at the Plaza Hotel）-I was walking along from one place to another, half on the sidewalks and half on the lawns. I was happier on the lawns because I had on shoes from England with rubber nobs on the soles that bit into the soft ground.I had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the wind, and whenever this happened the red-white-and-blue banners in front of all the houses stretched out stiff and said tut-tut-tut-tut, in a disapproving way.

The largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns belonged to Daisy Fay's house. She was just eighteen, two years older than me, and by far the most popular of all the young girls in Louisville.She dressed in white, and had a little white roadster, and all day long the telephone rang in her house and excited young officers from Camp Taylor demanded the privilege of monopolising her that night.‘Anyways, for an hour！'

When I came opposite her house that morning her white roadster was beside the curb, and she was sitting in it with a lieutenant I had never seen before. They were so engrossed in each other that she didn't see me until I was five feet away.

‘Hello, Jordan，'she called unexpectedly.‘Please come here.'

I was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because of all the older girls I admired her most. She asked me if I was going to the Red Cross and make bandages.I was.Well, then, would I tell them that she couldn't come that day?The officer looked at Daisy while she was speaking, in a way that every young girl wants to be looked at some time, and because it seemed romantic to me I have remembered the incident ever since.His name was Jay Gatsby, and I didn't lay eyes on him again for over four years-even after I'd met him on Long Island I didn't realise it was the same man.

That was 1917. By the next year I had a few beaux myself, and I began to play in tournaments, so I didn't see Daisy very often.She went with a slightly older crowd-when she went with anyone at all.Wild rumours were circulating about her-how her mother had found her packing her bag one winter night to go to New York and say goodbye to a soldier who was going overseas.She was effectually prevented, but she wasn't on speaking terms with her family for several weeks.After that she didn't play around with the soldiers any more, but only with a few flatfooted, short-sighted young men in town, who couldn't get into the army at all.

By the next autumn she was gay again, gay as ever. She had a debut after the Armistice, and in February she was presumably engaged to a man from New Orleans.In June she married Tom Buchanan of Chicago, with more pomp and circumstance than Louisville ever knew before.He came down with a hundred people in four private cars, and hired a whole floor of the Muhlbach Hotel, and the day before the wedding he gave her a string of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

I was a bridesmaid. I came into her room half an hour before the bridal dinner, and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the June night in her flowered dress-and as drunk as a monkey.She had a bottle of Sauterne in one hand and a letter in the other.

‘Gratulate me，'she muttered.‘Never had a drink before, but oh how I do enjoy it.'

‘What's the matter, Daisy?'

I was scared, I can tell you；I'd never seen a girl like that before.

‘Here, deares'.'She groped around in a waste-basket she had with her on thebed and pulled out thestring of pearls.‘Take them downstairs and give them back to whoever they belong to. Tell them all Daisy's changed her mind.Say：“Daisy's changed her mind！”'

She began to cry-she cried and cried. I rushed out and found her mother's maid, and we locked the door and got her into a cold bath.She wouldn't let go of the letter.She took it into the tub with her and squeezed it up into a wet ball, and only let me leave it in the soap-dish when she saw that it was coming to pieces like snow.

But she didn't say another word. We gave her spirits of ammonia and put ice on her forehead and hooked her back into her dress, and half an hour later, when we walked out of the room, the pearls were around her neck and the incident was over.Next day at five o'clock she married Tom Buchanan without so much as a shiver, and started off on a three months'trip to the South Seas.

I saw them in Santa Barbara when they came back, and I thought I'd never seen a girl so mad about her husband. If he left the room for a minute she'd look around uneasily, and say：‘Where's Tom gone?'and wear the most abstracted expression until she saw him coming in the door.She used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the hour, rubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with unfathom­able delight.It was touching to see them together-it made you laugh in a hushed, fascinated way.That was in August.A week after I left Santa Barbara, Tom ran into a wagon on the Ventura road one night, and ripped a front wheel off his car.The girl who was with him got into the papers, too, because her arm was broken-she was one of the chambermaids in the Santa Barbara Hotel.

The next April Daisy had her little girl, and they went to France for a year. I saw them one spring in Cannes, and later in Deauville, and then they came back to Chicago to settle down.Daisy was popular in Chicago, as you know.They moved with a fast crowd, all of them young and rich and wild, but she came out with an absolutely perfect reputation.Perhaps because she doesn't drink It's a great advantage not to drink among hard-drinking people.You can hold your tongue, and, moreover, you can time any little irregularity of your own so that everybody else is so blind that they don't see or care.Perhaps Daisy never went in for amour at all-and yet there's something in that voice of hers……

Well, about six weeks ago, she heard the name Gatsby for the first time in years. It was when I asked you-do you remember?-if you knew Gatsby in West Egg.After you had gone home she came into my room and woke me up, and said：‘What Gatsby?'and when I described him—I was half-asleep—she said in the strangest voice that it must be the man she used to know.It wasn't until then that I connected this Gatsby with the officer in her white car.

When Jordan Baker had finished telling all this we had left the Plaza for half an hour and were driving in a victoria through Central Park. The sun had gone down behind the tall apartments of the movie stars in the West Fifties, and the clear voices of children, already gathered like crickets on the grass, rose through the hot twilight：

‘I’m the Sheik of Araby.

Your love belongs to me.

At night when you’re asleep

Into your tent I’ll creep-’

‘It was a strange coincidence，'I said.

‘But it wasn't a coincidence at all.'

‘Why not?'

‘Gatsby bought that house so that Daisy would be just across the bay.'

Then it had not been merely the stars to which he had aspired on that June night. He came alive to me, delivered suddenly from the womb of his purposeless splendour.

‘He wants to know，'continued Jordan，‘if you'll invite Daisy to your house some afternoon and then let him come over.'

The modesty of the demand shook me. He had waited five years and bought a mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths-so that he could‘come over'some afternoon to a stranger's garden.

‘Did I have to know all this before he could ask such a little thing?'

‘He's afraid, he's waited so long. He thought you might be offended.You see, he's regular tough underneath it all.'

Something worried me.

‘Why didn't he ask you to arrange a meeting?'

‘He wants her to see his house，'she explained.‘And your house is right next door.'

‘Oh！'

‘I think he half expected her to wander into one of his parties, some night，'went on Jordan，‘but she never did. Then he began asking people casually if they knew her, and I was the first one he found.It was that night he sent for me at his dance, and you should have heard the elaborate way he worked up to it.O f course, I immediately suggested a luncheon in New York-and I thought he'd go mad：

‘“I don't want to do anything out of the way！”he kept saying.“I want to see her right next door.”

‘When I said you were a particular friend of Tom's, he started to abandon the whole idea. He doesn't know very much about Tom, though he says he's read a Chicago paper for years just on the chance of catching a glimpse of Daisy's name.'

It was dark now, and as we dipped under a little bridge I put my arm around Jordan's golden shoulder and drew her towards me and asked her to dinner. Suddenly I wasn't thinking of Daisy and Gatsby any more, but of this clean, hard, limited person, who dealt in universal scepticism, and who leaned back jauntily just within the circle of my arm.A phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort of heady excitement：‘There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy and the tired.'

‘And Daisy ought to have something in her life，'murmured Jordan to me.

‘Does she want to see Gatsby?'

‘She's not to know about it. Gatsby doesn't want her to know.You're just supposed to invite her to tea.'

We passed a barrier of dark trees, and then the facade of Fifty-ninth Street, a block of delicate pale light, beamed down into the park. Unlike Gatsby and Tom Buchanan, I had no girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs, and so I drew up the girl beside me, tightening my arms.Her wan, scornful mouth smiled, and so I drew her up again closer, this time to my face.





CHAPTER 5


When I came home to West Egg that night I was afraid for a moment that my house was on fire. Two o'clock and the whole comer of the peninsula was blazing with light, which fell unreal on the shrubbery and made thin elongating glints upon the roadside wires.Turning a comer, I saw that it was Gatsby's house, lit from tower to cellar.

At first I thought it was another party, a wild rout that had resolved itself into‘hide-and-seek'or‘sardines-in-the-box'with all the house thrown open to the game. But there wasn't a sound.Only wind in the trees, which blew the wires and made the lights go off and on again as if the house had winked into the darkness.As my taxi groaned away I saw Gatsby walking towards me across his lawn.

‘Your place looks like the World's Fair，'I said.

‘Does it?'He turned his eyes towards it absently.‘I have been glancing into some of the rooms. Let's go to Coney Island, old sport.In my car.'

‘It's too late.'

‘Well, suppose we take a plunge in the swimming-pool?I haven't made use of it all summer.'

‘I've got to go to bed.'

‘All right.'

He waited, looking at me with suppressed eagerness.

‘I talked with Miss Baker，'I said after a moment.‘I'm going to call up Daisy tomorrow and invite her over here to tea.'

‘Oh, that's all right，'he said carelessly.‘I don't want to put you to any trouble.'

‘What day would suit you?'

‘What day would suityou?'he corrected me quickly.‘I don't want to put you to any trouble, you see.'

‘How about the day after tomorrow?'

He considered for a moment. Then, with reluctance：‘I want to get the grass cut，'he said.

We both looked down at the grass-there was a sharp line where my ragged lawn ended and the darker, well-kept expanse of his began. I suspected that he meant my grass.

‘There's another little thing，'he said uncertainly, andhesitated.

‘Would you rather put it off for a few days?'I asked.

‘Oh, it isn't about that. At least-'He fumbled with a series of beginnings.‘Why, I thought-why, look here, old sport, you don't make much money, do you?'

‘Not very much.'

This seemed to reassure him and he continued more confidently.

‘I thought you didn't, if you'll pardon my-you see, I carry on a little business on the side, a sort of sideline, you understand. And I thought that if you don't make very much-You're selling bonds, aren't you, old sport?’

‘Trying to.'

‘Well, this would interest you. It wouldn't take up much of your time and you might pick up a nice bit of money.It happens to be a rather confidential sort of thing.'

I realise now that under different circumstances that conversation might have been one of the crises of my life. But, because the offer was obviously and tactlessly for a service to be rendered, I had no choice except to cut him off there.

‘I've got my hands full，'I said.‘I'm much obliged but I couldn't take on any more work.'

‘You wouldn't have to do any business with Wolfsheim.'Evidently he thought that I was shying away from the‘gonnegtion'mentioned at lunch, but I assured him he was wrong. He waited a moment longer, hoping I'd begin a conversation, but I was too absorbed to be responsive, so he went unwillingly home.

The evening had made me light-headed and happy；I think I walked into a deep sleep as I entered my front door. So I don't know whether or not Gatsby went to Coney Island, or for how many hours he‘glanced into rooms'while his house blazed gaudily on.I called up Daisy from the office next morning, and invited her to come to tea.

‘Don't bring Tom，'I warned her.

‘What?'

‘Don't bring Tom.'

‘Who is“Tom”?'she asked innocently.

The day agreed upon was pouring rain. At eleven o'clock a man in a raincoat, dragging a lawn-mower, tapped at my front door and said that Mr Gatsby had sent him over to cut my grass.This reminded me that I had forgotten to tell my Finn to come back, so I drove into West Egg Village to search for her among soggy whitewashed alleys and to buy some cups and lemons and flowers.

The flowers were unnecessary, for at two o'clock a greenhouse arrived from Gatsby's, with innumerable receptacles to contain it. An hour later the front door opened nervously, and Gatsby, in a white flannel suit, silver shirt and gold-coloured tie, hurried in.He was pale, and there were dark signs of sleeplessness beneath his eyes.

‘Is everything all right?'he asked immediately.

T h e grass looks fine, if that's what you mean.'

‘What grass?'he enquired blankly.‘Oh, the grass in the yard.'He looked out the window at it, but, judging from his expression, I don't believe he saw a thing.

‘Looks very good，'he remarked vaguely.‘One of the papers said they thought the rain would stop about four. I think it was The f ournal.

Have you got everything you need in the shape of-of tea?'

I took him into the pantry, where he looked a little reproachfully at the Finn. Together we scrutinised the twelve lemon cakes from the delicatessen shop.

‘Will they do?'I asked.

‘O f course, of course！They're fine！'and he added hollowly，‘……old sport.'

The rain cooled about half-past three to a damp mist, through which occasional thin drops swam like dew. Gatsby looked with vacant eyes through a copy of Clay's Economics, starting at the Finnish tread that shook the kitchen floor and peering towards the bleared windows from time to time as if a series of invisible but alarming happenings were taking place outside.Finally he got up and informed me, in an uncertain voice, that he was going home.

‘Why's that?'

‘Nobody's coming to tea. It's too late！'He looked at his watch as if there was some pressing demand on his time elsewhere.‘I can't wait all day.'

‘Don't be silly；it's just two minutes to four.'

He sat down miserably, as if I had pushed him, and simultaneously there was the sound of a motor turning into my lane. We both jumped up, and, a little harrowed myself, I went out into the yard.

Under the dripping bare lilac-trees a large open car was coming up the drive. It stopped.Daisy's face, tipped sideways beneath a three-cornered lavender hat, looked at me with a bright ecstatic smile.

‘Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one?'

The exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain. I had to follow the sound of it for a moment, up and down, with my ear alone, before any words came through.A damp streak of hair lay like a dash of blue paint across her cheek, and her hand was wet with glistening drops as I took it to help her from the car.

‘Are you in love with me，'she said low in my ear，‘or why did I have to come alone?'

‘That's the secret of Castle Rackrent. Tell your chauffeur to go far away and spend an hour.'

‘Come back in an hour, Ferdie.'Then in a grave murmur：‘His name is Ferdie.'

‘Does the gasoline affect his nose?'

‘I don't think so，'she said innocently.‘Why?'

We went in. To my overwhelming surprise the living-room was deserted.

‘Well, that's funny，'I exclaimed.

‘What's funny?'

She turned her head as there was a light dignified knocking at the front door. I went out and opened it.Gatsby, pale as death, with his hands plunged like weights in his coat pockets, was standing in a puddle of water glaring tragically into my eyes.

With his hands still in his coat pockets he stalked by me into the hall, turned sharply as if he were on a wire, and disappeared into the living-room. It wasn't a bit funny.Aware of the loud beating of my own heart I pulled the door to against the increasing rain.

For half a minute there wasn't a sound. Then from the living-room I heard a sort of choking murmur and part of a laugh, followed by Daisy's voice on a clear artificial note：‘I certainly am awfully glad to see you again.'

A pause；it endured horribly. I had nothing to do in the hall, so I went into the room.

Gatsby, his hands still in his pockets*was reclining against the mantelpiece in a strained counterfeit of perfect ease, even of boredom. His head leaned back so far that it rested against the face of a defunct mantelpiece clock, and from this position his distraught eyes stared down at Daisy, who was sitting, frightened but graceful, on the edge of a stiff chair.

‘W e've met before，'muttered Gatsby. His eyes glanced momentarily at me, and his lips parted with an abortive attempt at a laugh.Luckily the clock took this moment to tilt dangerously at the pressure of his head, whereupon he turned and caught it with trembling fingers and set it back in place.Then he sat down, rigidly, his elbow on the arm of the sofa and his chin in his hand.

‘I'm sorry about the clock，'he said.

M y own face had now assumed a deep tropical bum. I couldn't muster up a single commonplace out of the thousand in my head.

‘It's an old clock，'I told them idiotically.

I think we all believed for a moment that it had smashed in pieces on the floor.

‘We haven't met for many years，'said Daisy, her voice as matter-of-fact as it could ever be.

‘Five years next November.'

The automatic quality of Gatsby's answer set us all back at least another minute. I had them both on their feet with the desperate suggestion that they help me make tea in the kitchen when the demoniac Finn brought it in on a tray.

Amid the welcome confusion of cups and cakes a certain physical decency established itself. Gatsby got himself into a shadow and, while Daisy and I talked, looked conscientiously from one to the other of us with tense, unhappy eyes.However, as calmness wasn't an end in itself, I made an excuse at the fi rst possible moment, and got to my feet.

‘Where are you going?'demanded Gatsby in immediate alarm.

'I'll be back.'

I've got to speak to you about something before you go.'

He followed me wildly into the kitchen, closed the door, and whispered：‘Oh, God！'in a miserable way.

‘What's the matter?'

‘This is a terrible mistake，'he said, shaking his head from side to side，‘a terrible, terrible mistake.'

‘You're just embarrassed, that's all，'and luckily I added：‘Daisy's embarrassed too.'

‘She's embarrassed?'he repeated incredulously.

‘Just as much as you are.'

‘Don't talk so loud.'

‘You're acting like a little boy，'I broke out impatiently.‘Not only that, but you're rude. Daisy's sitting in there all alone.'

He raised his hand to stop my words, looked at me with unforgettable reproach, and, opening the door cautiously, went back into the other room.

I walked out the back way-just as Gatsby had when he had made his nervous circuit of the house half an hour before-and ran for a huge black knotted tree, whose massed leaves made a fabric against the rain. Once more it was pouring, and my irregular lawn, well shaved by Gatsby's gardener, abounded in small muddy swamps and prehistoric marshes.There was nothing to look at from under the tree except Gatsby's enormous house, so I stared at it, like Kant at his church steeple, for half an hour.A brewer had built it early in the‘period'craze a decade before, and there was a story that he'd agreed to pay five years'taxes on all the neighbouring cottages if the owners would have their roofs thatched with straw.Perhaps their refusal took the heart out of his plan to Found a Family-he went into an immediate decline.His children sold his house with the black wreath still on the door.Americans, while willing, even eager, to be serfs, have always been obstinate about being peasantry.

After half an hour, the sun shone again, and the grocer's automobile rounded Gatsby's drive with the raw material for his servants'dinner-I felt sure he wouldn't eat a spoonful. A maid began opening the upper windows of his house, appeared momentarily in each, and, leaning from the large central bay, spat meditatively into the garden.It was time I went back.While the rain continued it had seemed like the murmur of their voices, rising and swelling a little now and then with gusts of emotion.But in the new silence I felt that silence had fallen within the house too.

I went in-after making every possible noise in the kitchen, short of pushing over the stove-but I don't believe they heard a sound. They were sitting at either end of the couch, looking at each other as if some question had been asked, or was in the air, and every vestige of embarrassment was gone.Daisy's face was smeared with tears, and when I came in she jumped up and began wiping at it with her handkerchief before a mirror.But there was a change in Gatsby that was simply confounding.He literally glowed；without a word or a gesture of exultation a new well-being radiated from him and filled the little room.

‘Oh hello, old sport，'he said, as if he hadn't seen me for years. I thought for a moment he was going to shake hands.

‘It's stopped raining.'

‘Has it?'When he realised what I was talking about, that there were twinkle-bells of sunshine in the room, he smiled like a weather man, like an ecstatic patron of recurrent light, and repeated the news to Daisy.‘What do you think of that?It's stopped raining.'

‘I'm glad, Jay.'Her throat, full of aching, grieving beauty, told only of her unexpected joy.

‘I want you and Daisy to come over to my house，'he said，‘I'd like to show her around.'

‘You're sure you want me to come?'

‘Absolutely, old sport.'

Daisy went upstairs to wash her face-too late, I thought with humiliation of my towels-while Gatsby and I waited on the lawn.

'My house looks well, doesn't it?'he demanded.‘See how the whole front of it catches the light.'

I agreed that it was splendid.

‘Yes.'His eyes went over it, every arched door and square tower.‘It took me just three years to earn the money that bought it.'

‘I thought you inherited your money.'

‘I did, old sport，'he said automatically，‘but I lost most of it in the big panic-the panic of the war.'

I think he hardly knew what he was saying, for when I asked him what business he was in he answered：‘That's my affair，'before he realised that it wasn't an appropriate reply.

‘Oh, I've been in several things，'he corrected himself.‘I was in the drug business and then I was in the oil business. But I'm not in either one now.'He looked at me with more attention.‘Do you mean you've been thinking over what I proposed the other night?’

Before I could answer, Daisy came out of the house and two rows of brass buttons on her dress gleamed in the sunlight.

‘That huge place there?'she cried pointing.

‘Do you like it?'

‘I love it, but I don't see how you live there all alone.'

‘I keep it always full of interesting people, night and day. People who do interesting things.Celebrated people.'

Instead of taking the short cut along the Sound we went down to the road and entered by the big postern. With enchanting murmurs, Daisy admired this aspect or that of the feudal silhouette against the sky, admired the gardens, the sparking odour of jonquils and the frothy odour of hawthorn and plum blossoms and the pale gold odour of kiss-me-at-the-gate.It was strange to reach the marble steps and find no stir of bright dresses in and out of the door, and hear no sound but bird voices in the trees.

And inside, as we wandered through Marie Antoinette music-rooms and Restoration salons, I felt that there were guests concealed behind every couch and table, under orders to be breathlessly silent until we had passed through. As Gatsby closed the door of‘the Merton College Library'I could have sworn I heard the owl-eyed man break into ghostly laughter.

We went upstairs, through period bedrooms swathed in rose and lavender silk and vivid with new flowers, through dressing-rooms and poolrooms and bathrooms with sunken baths-intruding into one chamber where a dishevelled man in pyjamas was doing liver exercises on the floor. It was M r Klipspringer, the‘boarder'.I had seen him wandering hungrily about the beach that morning.Finally we came to Gatsby's own apartment, a bedroom and a bath, and an Adam study, where we sat down and drank a glass of some Chartreuse he took from a cupboard in the wall.

He hadn't once ceased looking at Daisy, and I think he revalued everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew from her well-loved eyes. Sometimes, too, he stared around at his possessions in a dazed way, as though in her actual and astounding presence none of it was any longer real.Once he nearly toppled down a flight of stairs.

His bedroom was the simplest room of all-except where the dresser was garnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold. Daisy took the brush with delight, and smoothed her hair, whereupon Gatsby sat down and shaded his eyes and began to laugh.

‘It's the funniest thing, old sport，'he said hilariously.‘I can't-When I try to-'

He had passed visibly through two states and was entering upon a third. After his embarrassment and his unreasoning joy he was consumed with wonder at her presence.He had been full of the idea so long, dreamed it right through to the end, waited with his teeth set, so to speak, at an inconceivable pitch of intensity.Now, in the reaction, he was running down like an overwound clock.

Recovering himself in a minute he opened for us two hulking patent cabinets which held his massed suits and dressing-gowns and ties, and his shirts, piled like bricks in stacks a dozen high.

‘I've got a man in England who buys me clothes. He sends over a selection of things at the beginning of each season, spring and fall.'

He took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them, one by one, before us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel, which lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in many-coloured disarray. While we admired he brought more and the soft rich heap mounted higher-shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in coral and apple-green and lavender and faint orange, with monograms of Indian blue.Suddenly, with a strained sound, Daisy bent her head into the shirts and began to cry stormily.

‘They're such beautiful shirts，'she sobbed, her voice muffled in the thick folds.‘It makes me sad because I've never seen such-such beautiful shirts before.'

After the house, we were to see the grounds and the swimming-pool, and the hydroplane and the midsummer flowers-but outside Gatsby's window it began to rain again, so we stood in a row looking at the corrugated surface of the Sound.

‘If it wasn't for the mist we could see your home across the bay，'said Gatsby.‘You always have a green light that burns all night at the end of your dock.'

Daisy put her arm through his abruptly, but he seemed absorbed in what he had just said. Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever.Compared to the great distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed very near to her, almost touching her.It had seemed as close as a star to the moon.Now it was again a green light on a dock.His count of enchanted objects had diminished by one.

I began to walk about the room, examining various indefinite objects in the half darkness. A large photograph of an elderly man in yachting costume attracted me, hung on the wall over his desk.

‘Who's this?'

‘That?That's Mr Dan Cody, old sport.'

The name sounded faintly familiar.

‘He's dead now. He used to be my best friend years ago.'

There was a small picture of Gatsby, also in yachting costume, on the bureau-Gatsby with his head thrown back defiantly-taken apparently when he was about eighteen.

‘I adore it，'exclaimed Daisy.‘The pompadour. You never told me you had a pompadour-or a yacht.'

‘Look at this，'said Gatsby quickly.‘Here's a lot of clippings-about you.'

They stood side by side examining it. I was going to ask to see the rubies when the phone rang, and Gatsby took up the receiver.

‘Yes……Well, I can't talk now……I can't talk now, old sport……I said a small town……He must know what a small town is……Well, he's no use to us if Detroit is his idea of a small town……'

He rang off.

‘Come here quick?cried Daisy at the window.

The rain was still falling, but the darkness had parted in the west, and there was a pink and golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea.

‘Look at that，'she whispered, and then after a moment：‘I'd like to just get one of those pink clouds and put you in it and push you around.'

I tried to go then, but they wouldn't hear of it；perhaps my presence made them feel more satisfactorily alone.

‘I know what we'll do，'said Gatsby，‘we'll have Klipspringer play the piano.'

He went out of the room calling，‘Ewing！'and returned in a few minutes accompanied by an embarrassed, slightly worn young man， with shell-rimmed glasses and scanty blond hair. He was now decently clothed, in a‘sport shirt'，open at the neck, sneakers and duck trousers of a nebulous hue.

‘Did we interrupt your exercises?'enquired Daisy politely.

‘I was asleep，'cried M r Klipspringer, in a spasm of embarrassment.‘That is, I'd been asleep. Then I got up……'

‘Klipspringer plays the piano，'said Gatsby, cutting him off.‘Don't you, Ewing, old sport?'

‘I don't play well. I don't-1 hardly play at all, I'm all out of prac—'

‘W e'll go downstairs，'interrupted Gatsby. He flipped a switch.The grey windows disappeared as the house glowed full of light.

In the music-room Gatsby turned on a solitary lamp beside the piano. He lit Daisy's cigarette from a trembling match, and sat down with her on a couch far across the room, where there was no light save what the gleaming floor bounced in from the hall.

When Klipspringer had played The Love Nest he turned around on the bench and searched unhappily for Gatsby in the gloom.

‘I'm all out of practice, you see. I told you I couldn't play.I'm all out of prac—'

‘Don't talk so much, old sport，'commanded Gatsby.‘Play！'

In the morning，

In the evening，

A in’t we gotfun-

Outside the wind was loud and there was a faint flow of thunder along the Sound. All the lights were going on in West Egg now；the electric trains, men-carrying, were plunging home through the rain from New York.It was the hour of a profound human change, and excitement was generating on the air.

One thing’s sure and nothing’s surer

The rich get richer and thepoorget-children.

In the meantime，

In between time-

As I went over to say goodbye I saw that the expression of bewilderment had come back into Gatsby's face, as though a faint doubt had occurred to him as to the quality of his present happiness. Almost five years！There must have been moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of his dreams-not through her own fault, but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion.It had gone beyond her, beyond everything.He had thrown himself into it with a creative passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright feather that drifted his way.No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man can store up in his ghostly heart.

As I watched him he adjusted himself a little, visibly. His hand took hold of hers, and as she said something low in his ear he turned towards her with a rush of emotion.I think that voice held him most, with its fluctuating, feverish warmth, because it couldn't be over-dreamed-that voice was a deathless song.

They had forgotten me, but Daisy glanced up and held out her hand；Gatsby didn't know me now at all. I looked once more at them and they looked back at me, remotely, possessed by intense life.Then I went out of the room and down the marble steps into the rain, leaving them there together.





CHAPTER 6


About this time an ambitious young reporter from New York arrived one morning at Gatsby's door and asked him if he had anything to say.

‘Anything to say about what?'enquired Gatsby politely.

‘Why-any statement to give out.'

It transpired after a confused five minutes that the man had heard Gatsby's name around his office in a connection which he either wouldn't reveal or didn't fully understand. This was his day off and with laudable initiative he had hurried out‘to see'.

It was a random shot, and yet the reporter's instinct was right. Gatsby's notoriety, spread about by the hundreds who had accepted his hospitality and so become authorities upon his past, had increased all summer until he fell just short of being news.Contemporary legends such as the‘underground pipeline to Canada'attached themselves to him, and there was one persistent story that he didn't live in a house at all, but in a boat that looked like a house and was moved secretly up and down the Long Island shore.Just why these inventions were a source of satisfaction to James Gatz of North Dakota isn't easy to say.

James Gatz-that was really, or at least legally, his name. He had changed it at the age of seventeen and at the specific moment that witnessed the beginning of his career-when he saw Dan Cody's yacht drop anchor over the most insidious flat on Lake Superior.It was James Gatz who had been loafing along the beach that afternoon in a tom green jersey and a pair of canvas pants, but it was already Jay Gatsby who borrowed a rowboat, pulled out to the Tuolomee and informed Cody that a wind might catch him and break him up in half an hour.

I suppose he'd had the name ready for a long time, even then. His parents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm people-his imagination had never really accepted them as his parents at all.The truth was that Jay Gatsby of West Egg, Long Island, sprang from his Platonic conception of himself.He was a son of God-a phrase which, if it means anything, means just that-and he must be about His Father's business, the service of a vast, vulgar and meretricious beauty.So he invented just the sort ofJay Gatsby that a seventeen-year-old boy would be likely to invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end.

For over a year he had been beating his way along the south shore of Lake Superior as a clam-digger and a salmon-fisher or in any other capacity that brought him food and bed. His brown, hardening body lived naturally through the half-fierce, half-lazy work of the bracing days.He knew women early, and since they spoiled him he became contemptuous of them, of young virgins because they were ignorant, of the others because they were hysterical about things which in his overwhelming self-absorption he took for granted.

But his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot. The most grotesque and fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night.A universe of ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the clock ticked on the washstand and the moon soaked with wet light his tangled clothes upon the floor.Each night he added to the pattern of his fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an oblivious embrace.For a while these reveries provided an outlet for his imagination；they were a satisfactory hint of the unreality of reality, a promise that the rock of the world was founded securely on a fairy's wing.

An instinct towards his future glory had led him, some months before, to the small Lutheran College of St Olaf's in southern Minnesota. He stayed there two weeks, dismayed at its ferocious indifference to the drums of his destiny, to destiny itself, and despising the janitor's work with which he was to pay his way through.Then he drifted back to Lake Superior, and he was still searching for something to do on the day that Dan Cody's yacht dropped anchor in the shallows alongshore.

Cody was fifty years old then, a product of the Nevada silver fields, of the Yukon, of every rush for metal since 1 875. The transactions in Montana copper that made him many times a millionaire found him physically robust but on the verge of soft-mindedness, and, suspecting this, an infinite number of women tried to separate him from his money.The none too savoury ramifications by which Ella Kaye, the newspaper woman, played Madame de Maintenon to his weakness and sent him to sea in a yacht, were common property of the turgid journalism of 1 902.He had been coasting along all too hospitable shores for five years when he turned up as James Gatz's destiny in Little Girl Bay.

To young Gatz, resting on his oars and looking up at the railed deck, that yacht represented all the beauty and glamour in the world. I suppose he smiled at Cody-he had probably discovered that people liked him when he smiled.At any rate Cody asked him a few questions（one of them elicited the brand new name）and found that he was quick and extravagantly ambitious.A few days later he took him to Duluth and bought him a blue coat, six pairs of white duck trousers, and a yachting cap.And when the Tuolomee left for the West Indies and the Barbary Coast Gatsby left too.

He was employed in a vague personal capacity-while he remained with Cody he was in turn steward, mate, skipper, secretary and even jailor, for Dan Cody sober knew what lavish doings Dan Cody drunk might soon be about, and he provided for such contingencies by reposing more and more trust in Gatsby. The arrangement lasted five years, during which the boat went three times around the Continent.It might have lasted indefinitely except for the fact that Ella Kaye came on board one night in Boston and a week later Dan Cody inhospitably died.

I remember the portrait of him up in Gatsby's bedroom, a grey, florid man with a hard, empty face-the pioneer debauchee, who during one phase of American life brought back to the Eastern seaboard the savage violence of the frontier brothel and saloon. It was indirectly due to Cody that Gatsby drank so little.Sometimes in the course of gay parties women used to rub champagne into his hair；for himself he formed the habit of letting liquor alone.

And it was from Cody that he inherited money-a legacy of twenty-five thousand dollars. He didn't get it.He never understood the legal device that was used against him, but what remained of the millions went intact to Ella Kaye.He was left with his singularly appropriate education；the vague contour of Jay Gatsby had filled out to the substantiality of a man.

He told me all this very much later, but I've put it down here with the idea of exploding those first wild rumours about his antecedents, which weren't even faintly true. Moreover he told it to me at a time of confusion, when I had reached the point of believing everything and nothing about him.So I take advantage of this short halt, while Gatsby, so to speak, caught his breath, to clear this set of misconceptions away.

It was a halt, too, in my association with his affairs. For several weeks I didn't see him or hear his voice on the phone-mostly I was in New York, trotting around with Jordan and trying to ingratiate myself with her senile aunt-but finally I went over to his house one Sunday afternoon.I hadn't been there two minutes when somebody brought Tom Buchanan in for a drink.I was startled, naturally, but the really surprising thing was that it hadn't happened before.

They were a party of three on horseback-Tom and a man named Sloane and a pretty woman in a brown riding-habit who had been there previously.

‘I'm delighted to see you，'said Gatsby, standing on his porch.‘I'm delighted that you dropped in.'

As though they cared！

‘Sit right down. Have a cigarette or a cigar.'He walked around the room quickly, ringing bells.‘I'll have something to drink for you in just a minute.'

He was profoundly affected by the fact that Tom was there. But he would be uneasy anyhow until he had given them something, realising in a vague way that that was all they came for.Mr Sloane wanted nothing.A lemonade?No, thanks.A little champagne?Nothing at all, thanks……I'm sorry-

‘Did you have a nice ride?'

‘Very good roads around here.'

‘I suppose the automobiles-'

‘Yeah.'

Moved by an irresistible impulse, Gatsby turned to Tom, who had accepted the introduction as a stranger.

‘I believe we've met somewhere before, Mr Buchanan.'

‘Oh, yes，'said Tom, gruffly polite, but obviously not remembering.‘So we did. I remember very well.'

‘About two weeks ago.'

‘That's right. You were with Nick here.'

‘I know your wife，'continued Gatsby, almost aggressively.

‘That so?'

Tom turned to me.

‘You live near here, Nick?'

‘Next door.'

‘That so?'

M r Sloane didn't enter into the conversation, but lounged back haughtily in his chair；the woman said nothing either-until unexpectedly, after two highballs, she became cordial.

W e'll all come over to your next party, M r Gatsby，'she suggested.‘What do you say?'

‘Certainly；I'd be delighted to have you.'

‘Be very nice，'said Mr Sloane, without gratitude.‘Well-think ought to be starting home.'

‘Please don't hurry，'Gatsby urged them. He had control of himself now, and he wanted to see more of Tom.‘Why don't you-why don't you stay for supper?I wouldn't be surprised if some other people dropped in from New York.’

‘You come to supper with me，'said the lady enthusiastically.‘Both of you.'

This included me. Mr Sloane got to his feet.

‘Come along，'he said-but to her only.

‘I mean it，'she insisted.‘I'd love to have you. Lots of room.'

Gatsby looked at me questioningly. He wanted to go, and he didn't see that M r Sloane had determined he shouldn't.

‘I'm afraid I won't be able to，'I said.

‘Well, you come，'she urged, concentrating on Gatsby.

M r Sloane murmured something close to her ear.

‘We won't be late if we start now，'she insisted aloud.

‘I haven't got a horse，'said Gatsby.‘I used to ride in the army, but I've never bought a horse. I'll have to follow you in my car.Excuse me for just a minute.'

The rest of us walked out on the porch, where Sloane and the lady began an impassioned conversation aside.

‘M y God, I believe the man's coming，'said Tom.‘Doesn't he know she doesn't want him?'

‘She says she does want him.'

‘She has a big dinner party and he won't know a soul there.'He frowned.‘I wonder where in the devil he met Daisy. By God, I may be old-fashioned in my ideas, but women run around too much these days to suit me.They meet all kinds of crazy fish.'

Suddenly Air Sloane and the lady walked down the steps and mounted their horses.

‘Come on，'said Mr Sloane to Tom，‘we're late. W e've got to go.'And then to me：‘Tell him we couldn't wait, will you?’

Tom and I shook hands, the rest of us exchanged a cool nod, and they trotted quickly down the drive, disappearing under the August foliage just as Gatsby, with hat and light overcoat in hand, came out the front door.

Tom was evidently perturbed at Daisy's running around alone, for on the following Saturday night he came with her to Gatsby's party. Perhaps his presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of oppressiveness-it stands out in my memory from Gatsby's other parties that summer.There were the same people, or at least the same sort of people, the same profusion of champagne, the same many-coloured, many-keyed commotion, but I felt an unpleasantness in the air, a pervading harshness that hadn't been there before.Or perhaps I had merely grown used to it, grown to accept West Egg as a world complete in itself, with its own standards and its own great figures, second to nothing because it had no consciousness of being so, and now I was looking at it again, through Daisy's eyes.It is invariably saddening to look through new eyes at things upon which you have expended your own powers of adjustment.

They arrived at twilight, and, as we strolled out among the sparkling hundreds, Daisy's voice was playing murmurous tricks in her throat.

‘These things excite me so，1she whispered.‘If you want to kiss me any time during the evening, Nick, just let me know and I'll be glad to arrange it for you. Just mention my name.Or present a green card.I'm giving out green-'

‘Look around，'suggested Gatsby.

‘I'm looking around. I'm having a marvellous-'

‘You must see the faces of many people you've heard about.'

Tom's arrogant eyes roamed the crowd.

‘We don't go around very much，'he said；‘in fact, I was just thinking I don't know a soul here.'

‘Perhaps you know that lady，'Gatsby indicated a gorgeous, scarcely human orchid of a woman who sat in state under a white-plum tree. Tom and Daisy stared, with that particularly unreal feeling that accompanies the recognition of a hitherto ghosdy celebrity of the movies.

‘She's lovely，'said Daisy.

‘The man bending over her is her director.'

He took them ceremoniously from group to group：

‘Mrs Buchanan……and Mr Buchanan-'After an instant's hesitation he added：‘the polo player.'

‘Oh, no，'objected Tom quickly，‘not me.'

But evidently the sound of it pleased Gatsby, for Tom remained‘the polo player'for the rest of the evening.

‘I've never met so many celebrities，'Daisy exclaimed.‘I liked that man-what was his name?-with the sort of blue nose.'

Gatsby identified him, adding that he was a small producer.

‘Well, I liked him anyhow.'

‘I'd a little rather not be the polo player，'said Tom pleasantly，‘I'd rather look at all these famous people in-in oblivion.'

Daisy and Gatsby danced. I remember being surprised by his graceful, conservative foxtrot-I had never seen him dance before.Then they sauntered over to my house and sat on the steps for half an hour, while, at her request, I remained watchfully in the garden.‘In case there's a fire, or a flood，'she explained，‘or any act of God.'

Tom appeared from his oblivion as we were sitting down to supper together.‘Do you mind if I eat with some people over here?'he said.‘A fellow's getting off some funny stuff.'

‘Go ahead，'answered Daisy genially，‘and if you want to take down any addresses here's my little gold pencil.'……She looked around after a moment and told me the girl was‘common but pretty'，and I knew that except for the half-hour she'd been alone with Gatsby she wasn’t having a good time.

We were at a particularly tipsy table. That was my fault-Gatsby had been called to the phone, and I'd enjoyed these same people only two weeks before.But what had amused me then turned septic on the air now.

‘How do you feel, Miss Baedeker?'

The girl addressed was trying, unsuccessfully, to slump against my shoulder. At this enquiry she sat up and opened her eyes.

‘What?'

A massive and lethargic woman, who had been urging Daisy to play golf with her at the local club tomorrow, spoke in Miss Baedeker's defence：‘Oh, she's all right now. When she's had five or six cocktails she always starts screaming like that.I tell her she ought to leave it alone.'

‘I do leave it alone，'affirmed the accused hollowly.

‘We heard you yelling, so I said to Doc Civet here：“There's somebody that needs your help, Doc.”'

‘She's much obliged, I'm sure，'said another friend, without gratitude，‘but you got her dress all wet when you stuck her head in the pool.'

‘Anything I hate is to get my head stuck in a pool，'mumbled Miss Baedeker.‘They almost drowned me once over in New Jersey.'

‘Then you ought to leave it alone，'countered Doctor Civet.

‘Speak for yourself！'cried Miss Baedeker violently.‘Your hand shakes. I wouldn't let you operate on me！'

It was like that. Almost the last thing I remember was standing with Daisy and watching the moving-picture director and his Star.They were still under the white-plum tree and their faces were touching except for a pale, thin ray of moonlight between.It occurred to me that he had been very slowly bending towards her all evening to attain this proximity, and even while I watched I saw him stoop one ultimate degree and kiss at her cheek.

‘I like her，'said Daisy，‘I think she's lovely.'

But the rest offended her-and inarguably, because it wasn't a gesture but an emotion. She was appalled by West Egg, this unprecedented‘place'that Broadway had begotten upon a Long Island fishing village-appalled by its raw vigour that chafed under the old euphemisms and by the too obtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants along a short-cut from nothing to nothing.She saw something awful in the very simplicity she failed to understand.

I sat on the front steps with them while they waited for their car. It was dark here；only the bright door sent ten square feet of light volley­ing out into the soft black morning.Sometimes a shadow moved against a dressing-room blind above, gave way to another shadow, an indefinite procession of shadows, that rouged and powdered in an invisible glass.

‘Who is this Gatsby anyhow?'demanded Tom suddenly.‘Some big bootlegger?'

‘Where'd you hear that?'I enquired.

‘I didn't hear it. I imagined it.A lot of these newly rich people are just big boodeggers, you know.'

‘Not Gatsby，'I said shortly.

He was silent for a moment. The pebbles of the drive crunched under his feet.

‘Well, he certainly must have strained himself to get this menagerie together.'

A breeze stirred the grey haze of Daisy's fur collar.

‘At least they are more interesting than the people we know，'she said with an effort.

‘You didn't look so interested.'

‘Well, I was.'

Tom laughed and turned to me.

‘Did you notice Daisy's face when that girl asked her to put her under a cold shower?'

Daisy began to sing with the music in a husky, rhythmic whisper, bringing out a meaning in each word that it had never had before and would never have again. When the melody rose, her voice broke up sweedy, following it, in a way contralto voices have, and each change tipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air.

‘Lots of people come who haven't been invited，'she said suddenly.‘That girl hadn't been invited. They simply force their way in and he's too polite to object.'

‘I'd like to know who he is and what he does，'insisted Tom.‘And I think I'll make a point of finding out.'

‘I can tell you right now，'she answered.‘He owned some drug­stores, a lot of drugstores. He built them up himself.'

The dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive.

‘Good-night, Nick，'said Daisy.

Her glance left me and sought the lighted top of the steps, where Three O'Clock in the Morning, a neat, sad little waltz of that year, was drifting out the open door. After all, in the very casualness of Gatsby's party there were romantic possibilities totally absent from her world.What was it up there in the song that seemed to be calling her back inside?What would happen now in the dim, incalculable hours?Perhaps some unbelievable guest would arrive, a person infinitely rare and to be marvelled at, some authentically radiant young girl who with one fresh glance at Gatsby, one moment of magical encounter, would blot out those five years of unwavering devotion.

I stayed late that night, Gatsby asked me to wait until he was free, and I lingered in the garden until the inevitable swimming party had run up, chilled and exalted, from the black beach, until the lights were extinguished in the guest-rooms overhead. When he came down the steps at last the tanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face, and his eyes were bright and tired.

‘She didn't like it，'he said immediately.

‘Of course she did.'

‘She didn't like it，'he insisted.‘She didn't have a good time.'

He was silent, and I guessed at his unutterable depression.‘I feel far away from her，'he said.‘It's hard to make her understand.'

‘You mean about the dance?'

‘The dance?'He dismissed all the dances he had given with a snap of his fingers.‘Old sport, the dance is unimportant.'

He wanted nothing less of Daisy than that she should go to Tom and say：‘I never loved you.'After she had obliterated four years with that sentence they could decide upon the more practical measures to be taken. One of them was that, after she was free, they were to go back to Louisville and be married from her house-just as if it were five years ago.

‘And she doesn't understand，'he said.‘She used to be able to understand. W e'd sit for hours-'

He broke off and began to walk up and down a desolate path of fruit rinds and discarded favours and crushed flowers.

‘I wouldn't ask too much of her，'I ventured.‘You can't repeat the past.'

‘Can't repeat the past?'he cried incredulously.‘Why of course you can！'

He looked around him wildly, as if the past were lurking here in the shadow of his house, just out of reach of his hand.

'I'm going to fix everything just the way it was before，'he said, nodding determinedly.‘She'll see.'

He talked a lot about the past, and I gathered that he wanted to recover something, some idea of himself perhaps, that had gone into loving Daisy. His life had been confused and disordered since then, but if he could once return to a certain starting place and go over it all slowly, he could find out what that thing was……

……One autumn night, five years before, they had been walking down the street when the leaves were falling, and they came to a place where there were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight. They stopped here and turned towards each other.Now it was a cool night with that mysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changes of the year.The quiet lights in the houses were burning out into the darkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars.Out of the comer of his eye Gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalks really formed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the trees-he could climb to it, if he climbed alone, and once there he could suck on the pap of life, gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder.

His heart beat faster and faster as Daisy's white face came up to his own. He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God.So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning-fork that had been struck upon a star.Then he kissed her.At his lips'touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete.

Through all he said, even through his appalling sentimentality, I was reminded of something-an elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words, that I had heard somewhere a long time ago. For a moment a phrase tried to take shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man's, as though there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled air.But they made no sound, and what I had almost remembered was uncommunicable for ever.





CHAPTER 7


It was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its highest that the lights in his house failed to go on one Saturday night-and, as obscurely as it had begun, his career as Trimalchio was over. Only gradually did I become aware that the automobiles which turned expectantly into his drive stayed for just a minute and then drove sulkily away.Wondering if he were sick I went over to find out-an unfamiliar butler with a villainous face squinted at me suspiciously from the door.

‘Is Mr Gatsby sick?'

‘Nope.'After a pause he added‘sir'in a dilatory, grudging way.

‘I hadn't seen him around, and I was rather worried. Tell him Mr Carraway came over.'

‘Who?'he demanded rudely.

‘Carraway.'

‘Carraway. All right, I'll tell him.'

Abruptly he slammed the door.

M y Finn informed me that Gatsby had dismissed every servant in his house a week ago and replaced them with half a dozen others, who never went into West Egg Village to be bribed by the tradesmen, but ordered moderate supplies over the telephone. The grocery boy reported that the kitchen looked like a pigsty, and the general opinion in the village was that the new people weren't servants at all.

Next day Gatsby called me on the phone.

‘Going away?'I enquired.

‘No, old sport.'

‘I hear you fired all your servants.'

‘I wanted somebody who wouldn't gossip. Daisy comes over quite often-in the afternoons.'

So the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house at the disapproval in her eyes.

‘They're some people Wolfsheim wanted to do something for. They're all brothers and sisters.They used to run a small hotel.'

‘I see.'

He was calling up at Daisy's request-would I come to lunch at her house tomorrow?Miss Baker would be there. Half an hour later Daisy herself telephoned and seemed relieved to find that I was coming.Something was up.And yet I couldn't believe that they would choose this occasion for a scene-especially for the rather harrowing scene that Gatsby had outlined in the garden.

The next day was broiling, almost the last, certainly the warmest, of the summer. As my train emerged from the tunnel into sunlight, only the hot whistles of the National Biscuit Company broke the simmering hush at noon.The straw seats of the car hovered on the edge of combustion；the woman next to me perspired delicately for a while into her white shirtwaist, and then, as her newspaper dampened under her fingers, lapsed despairingly into deep heat with a desolate cry.Her pocket-book slapped to the floor.

‘Oh, my！'she gasped.

I picked it up with a weary bend and handed it back to her, holding it at arm's length and by the extreme tip of the comers to indicate that I had no designs upon it-but everyone near by, including the woman, suspected me just the same.

‘Hot！'said the conductor to familiar faces.‘Some weather……Hot！……Hot！……Hot！……Is it hot enough for you?Is it not?Is i t……?'

M y commutation ticket came back to me with a dark stain from his hand. That anyone should care in this heat whose flushed lips he kissed, whose head made damp the pyjama pocket over his heart！

……Through the hall of the Buchanans'house blew a faint wind, carrying the sound of the telephone bell out to Gatsby and me as we waited at the door.

‘The master's body！'roared the butler into the mouthpiece.‘I'm sorry, madame, but we can't furnish it-it's far too hot to touch this noon！’

What he really said was：‘Yes……Yes……I'll see.'

He set down the receiver and came towards us, glistening slightly, to take our stiff straw hats.

‘Madame expects you in the salon！'he cried, needlessly indicating the direction. In this heat every extra gesture was an affront to the common store of life.

The room, shadowed well with awnings, was dark and cool. Daisy and Jordan lay upon an enormous couch, like silver idols weighing down their own white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans.

‘We can't move，'they said together.

Jordan's fingers, powdered white over their tan, rested for a moment in mine.

‘And Mr Thomas Buchanan, the athlete?'I enquired.

Simultaneously I heard his voice, gruff, muffled, husky, at the hall telephone.

Gatsby stood in the centre of the crimson carpet and gazed around with fascinated eyes. Daisy watched him and laughed her sweet, exciting laugh；a tiny gust of powder rose from her bosom into the air.

‘The rumour is，'whispered Jordan，‘that that's Tom's girl on the telephone.'

We were silent. The voice in the hall rose high with annoyance：‘Very well, then, I won't sell you the car at all……I'm under no obligations to you at all……and as for your bothering me about it at lunch time, I won't stand that at all！'

‘Holding down the receiver，'said Daisy cynically.

‘No, he's not，'I assured her.‘It's a bona-fide deal. I happen to know about it.'

Tom flung open the door, blocked out its space for a moment with his thick body, and hurried into the room.

‘Mr Gatsby！'He put out his broad, flat hand with well-concealed dislike.'I'm glad to see you, sir……Nick……'

‘Make us a cold drink，'cried Daisy.

As he left the room again she got up and went over to Gatsby and pulled his face down, kissing him on the mouth.

‘You know I love you，'she murmured.

‘You forget there's a lady present，'saidJordan.

Daisy looked around doubtfully.

‘You kiss Nick too.'

‘What a low, vulgar girl！'

‘I don't care！'cried Daisy, and began to clog on the brick fireplace. Then she remembered the heat and sat down guiltily on the couch just as a freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came into the room.

‘Bles-sed pre-cious，'she crooned, holding out her arms.‘Come to your own mother that loves you.'

The child, relinquished by the nurse, rushed across the room and rooted shyly into her mother's dress.

‘The bles-sed pre-cious！Did mother get powder on your old yellowy hair?Stand up now, and say-How-de-do.'

Gatsby and I in turn leaned down and took the small reluctant hand. Afterwards he kept looking at the child with surprise.I don't think he had ever really believed in its existence before.

‘I got dressed before luncheon，'said the child, turning eagerly to Daisy.

‘That's because your mother wanted to show you off.'Her face bent into the single wrinkle of the small white neck.‘You dream, you. You absolute little dream.'

‘Yes，'admitted the child calmly.‘AuntJordan's got on awhite dress, too.'

‘How do you like mother's friends?'Daisy turned her around so that she faced Gatsby.‘Do you think they're pretty?'

‘Where's Daddy?'

‘She doesn't look like her father，'explained Daisy.‘She looks like me. She's got my hair and shape of the face.'

Daisy sat back upon the couch. The nurse took a step forward and held out her hand.

‘Come, Pammy.'

‘Goodbye, sweetheart！'

With a reluctant backward glance the well-disciplined child held to her nurse's hand and was pulled out of the door, just as Tom came back, preceding four gin rickeys that clicked full of ice.

Gatsby took up his drink.

‘They certainly look cool，'he said, with visible tension.

We drank in long, greedy swallows.

‘I read somewhere that the sun's getting hotter every year，'said Tom genially.‘It seems that pretty soon the earth's going to fall into the sun-or wait a minute-it's just the opposite-the sun's getting colder every year.’

‘Come outside，'he suggested to Gatsby，‘I'd like you to have a look at the place.'

I went with them out to the veranda. On the green Sound, stagnant in the heat, one small sail crawled slowly towards the fresher sea.Gatsby's eyes followed it momentarily；he raised his hand and pointed across the bay.

‘I'm right across from you.'

‘So you are.'

Our eyes lifted over the rose-beds and the hot lawn and the weedy refuse of the dog-days along-shore. Slowly the white wings of the boat moved against the blue cool limit of the sky.Ahead lay the scalloped ocean and the abounding blessed isles.

‘There's sport for you，'said Tom, nodding.‘I'd like to be out there with him for about an hour.'

We had luncheon in the dining-room, darkened too against the heat, and drank down nervous gaiety with the cold ale.

‘What'll we do with ourselves this afternoon?'cried Daisy，‘and the day after that, and the next thirty years?'

‘Don't be morbid，'Jordan said.‘Life starts all over again when it gets crisp in the fall.'

‘But it's so hot，'insisted Daisy, on the verge of tears，‘and everything's so confused. Let's all go to town！'

Her voice struggled on through the heat, beating against it, moulding its senselessness into forms.

‘I've heard of making a garage out of a stable，'Tom was saying to Gatsby，‘but I'm the first man who ever made a stable out of a garage.'

‘Who wants to go to town?'demanded Daisy insistently. Gatsby's eyes floated towards her.‘Ah，'she cried，‘you look so cool.'

Their eyes met, and they stared together at each other, alone in space. With an effort she glanced down at the table.

‘You always look so cool，'she repeated.

She had told him that she loved him, and Tom Buchanan saw. He was astounded.His mouth opened a little, and he looked at Gatsby, and then back at Daisy as if he had just recognised her as someone he knew a long time ago.

‘You resemble the advertisement of the man，'she went on innocently.‘You know the advertisement of the man-'

‘All right/broke in Tom quickly，‘I'm perfectly willing to go to town. Come on-we're all going to town.'

He got up, his eyes still flashing between Gatsby and his wife. No one moved.

‘Come on！'His temper cracked a little.‘What's the matter, anyhow?If we're going to town, let's start.'

His hand, trembling with his effort at self-control, bore to his lips the last of his glass of ale. Daisy's voice got us to our feet and out on to the blazing gravel drive.

‘Are we just going to go?'she objected.‘Like this?Aren't we going to let anyone smoke a cigarette first?'

‘Everybody smoked all through lunch.'

‘Oh, let's have fun，'she begged him.‘It's too hot to fuss.'

He didn't answer.

‘Have it your own way，'she said.‘Come on, Jordan.'

They went upstairs to get ready while we three men stood there shuffling the hot pebbles with our feet. A silver curve of the moon hovered already in the western sky.Gatsby started to speak, changed his mind, but not before Tom wheeled and faced him expectantly.

‘Have you got your stables here?'asked Gatsby with an effort.

‘About a quarter of a mile down the road.'

‘Oh.'

A pause.

‘I don't see the idea of going to town，'broke out Tom savagely.‘Women get these notions in their heads-'

‘Shall we take anything to drink?'called Daisy from an upper window.

‘I'll get some whiskey，'answered Tom. He went inside.

Gatsby turned to me rigidly：‘I can't say anything in his house, old sport.'

‘She's got an indiscreet voice，'I remarked.‘It's full o f-'I hesitated.

‘Her voice is full of money，'he said suddenly.

That was it. I'd never understood before.It was full of money-that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbal's song of i t……High in a white palace the king's daughter, the golden girl……

Tom came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle in a towel, followed by Daisy andJordan wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth and carrying light capes over their arms.

‘Shall we all go in my car?'suggested Gatsby. He felt the hot, green leather of the seat.‘I ought to have left it in the shade.'

‘Is it standard shift?'demanded Tom.

‘Yes.'

‘Well, you take my coupe and let me drive your car to town.'

The suggestion was distasteful to Gatsby.

‘I don't think there's much gas，'he objected.

‘Plenty of gas，'said Tom boisterously. He looked at the gauge.‘And if it runs out I can stop at a drugstore.You can buy anything at a drug-store nowadays.'

A pause followed this apparently pointless remark. Daisy looked at Tom frowning, and an indefinable expression, at once definitely unfamiliar and vaguely recognisable, as if I had only heard it described in words, passed over Gatsby's face.

‘Come on, Daisy，'said Tom, pressing her with his hand towards Gatsby's car.‘I'll take you in this circus wagon.'

He opened the door, but she moved out from the circle of his arm.

‘You take Nick andJordan. W e'll follow you in the coupe.'

She walked close to Gatsby, touching his coat with her hand. Jordan and Tom and I got into the front seat of Gatsby's car, Tom pushed the unfamiliar gears tentatively, and we shot off into the oppressive heat, leaving them out of sight behind.

‘Did you see that?'demanded Tom.

‘See what?'

He looked at me keenly, realising thatJordan and I must have known all along.

‘You think I'm pretty dumb, don't you?'he suggested.‘Perhaps I am, but I have a-almost a second sight, sometimes, that tells me what to do. Maybe you don't believe that, but science-'

He paused. The immediate contingency overtook him, pulled him back from the edge of the theoretical abyss.

‘I've made a small investigation of this fellow，'he continued.‘I could have gone deeper if I'd known-'

‘Do you mean you've been to a medium?'enquired Jordan humorously.

‘What?'Confused, he stared at us as we laughed.‘A medium?'

‘About Gatsby.'

‘About Gatsby！No, I haven't. I said I'd been making a small investigation of his past.'

‘And you found he was an Oxford man，'saidJordan helpfully.

‘An Oxford man！'He was incredulous.‘Like hell he is！He wears a pink suit.'

‘Nevertheless he's an Oxford man.'

‘Oxford, New Mexico，'snorted Tom contemptuously，‘or something like that.'

‘Listen, Tom. If you're such a snob, why did you invite him to lunch?'demanded Jordan crossly.

‘Daisy invited him；she knew him before we were married-God knows where！'

We were all irritable now with the fading ale, and aware of it we drove for a while in silence. Then as Doctor T.J.Eckleburg's faded eyes came into sight down the road, I remembered Gatsby's caution about gasoline.

‘W e've got enough to get us to town，'said Tom.

‘But there's a garage right here，'objected Jordan.‘I don't want to get stalled in this baking heat.'

Tom threw on both brakes impatiently, and we slid to an abrupt dusty stop under Wilson's sign. After a moment the proprietor emerged from the interior of his establishment and gazed hollow-eyed at the car.

‘Let's have some gas！'cried Tom roughly.‘What do you think we stopped for-to admire the view?'

‘I'm sick，'said Wilson without moving.‘Been sick all day.'

‘What's the matter?'

‘I'm all run down.'

‘Well, shall I help myself?'Tom demanded.‘You sounded well enough on the phone.'

With an effort Wilson left the shade and support of the doorway and, breathing hard, unscrewed the cap of the tank. In the sunlight his face was green.

‘I didn't mean to interrupt your lunch，'he said.‘But I need money pretty bad, and I was wondering what you were going to do with your old car.'

‘How do you like this one?'enquired Tom.‘I bought it last week.'

‘It's a nice yellow one，'said Wilson, as he strained at the handle.

‘Like to buy it?'

‘Big chance，'Wilson smiled faintly.‘No, but I could make some money on the other.'

‘What do you want money for, all of a sudden?'

‘I've been here too long. I want to get away.M y wife and I want to go West.'

‘Your wife does?'exclaimed Tom, startled.

‘She's been talking about it for ten years.'He rested for a moment against the pump, shading his eyes.‘And now she's going whether she wants to or not. I'm going to get her away.'

The coupe flashed by us with a flurry of dust and the flash of a waving hand.

‘What do I owe you?'demanded Tom harshly.

‘I just got wised up to something funny the last two days，'remarked Wilson.‘That's why I want to get away. That's why I been bothering you about the car.'

‘What do I owe you?'

‘Dollar twenty.'

The relentless beating heat was beginning to confuse me and I had a bad moment there before I realised that so far his suspicions hadn't alighted on Tom. He had discovered that Myrtle had some sort of life apart from him in another world, and the shock had made him physically sick.I stared at him and then at Tom, who had made a parallel discovery less than an hour before-and it occurred to me that there was no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so profound as the difference between the sick and the well.Wilson was so sick that he looked guilty, unforgivably guilty-as if he had just got some poor girl with child.

‘I'll let you have that car，'said Tom.‘I'll send it over tomorrow afternoon.'

That locality was always vaguely disquieting, even in the broad glare of afternoon, and now I turned my head as though I had been warned of something behind. Over the ashheaps the giant eyes of Doctor T.J.Eckleburg kept their vigil, but I perceived, after a moment, that the other eyes were regarding us less than twenty feet away.

In one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved aside a little, and Myrtle Wilson was peering down at the car. So engrossed was she that she had no consciousness of being observed, and one emotion after another crept into her face like objects into a slowly developing picture.Her expression was curiously familiar-it was an expression I had often seen on women's faces, but on Myrtle Wilson's face it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until I realised that her eyes, wide with jealous terror, were fixed not on Tom, but on Jordan Baker, whom she took to be his wife.

There is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind, and as we drove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic. His wife and his mistress, until an hour ago secure and inviolate, were slipping precipitately from his control.Instinct made him step on the accelerator with the double purpose of overtaking Daisy and leaving Wilson behind, and we sped along towards Astoria at fifty miles an hour, until, among the spidery girders of the elevated, we came in sight of the easy-going blue coupé.

‘Those big movies around Fiftieth Street are cool，'suggestedJordan.‘I love New York on summer afternoons when everyone's away. There's something very sensuous about it-overripe, as if all sorts of funny fruits were going to fall into your hands.'

The word‘sensuous'had the effect of further disquieting Tom, but before he could invent a protest the coupe came to a stop, and Daisy signalled us to draw up alongside.

‘Where are we going?'she cried.

‘How about the movies?'

‘It's so hot，'she complained.‘You go. W e'll ride around and meet you after.'With an effort her wit rose faintly，‘W e'll meet you on some comer.I’ll be the man smoking two cigarettes.’

‘We can't argue about it here，'Tom said impatiently, as a truck gave out a cursing whistle behind us.‘You follow me to the south side of Central Park, in front of the Plaza.'

Several times he turned his head and looked back for their car, and if the traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into sight. I think he was afraid they would dart down a side street and out of his life for ever.

But they didn't. And we all took the less explicable step of engaging the parlour of a suite in the Plaza Hotel.

The prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by herding us into that room eludes me, though I have a sharp physical memory that, in the course of it, my underwear kept climbing like a damp snake around my legs and intermittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back. The notion originated with Daisy's suggestion that we hire five bathrooms and take cold baths, and then assumed more tangible form as‘a place to have a mint julep'.Each of us said over and over that it was a‘crazy idea'-we all talked at once to a baffled clerk and thought, or pretended to think, that we were being very funny……

The room was large and stifling, and, though it was already four o'clock, opening the windows admitted only a gust of hot shrubbery from the Park. Daisy went to the mirror and stood with her back to us, fixing her hair.

‘It's a swell suite，'whispered Jordan respectfully, and everyone laughed.

‘Open another window，'commanded Daisy, without turning around.

‘There aren't any more.'

‘Well, we'd better telephone for an axe-'

‘The thing to do is to forget about the heat，'said Tom impatiently.‘You make it ten times worse by crabbing about it.'

He unrolled the bottle of whiskey from the towel and put it on the table.

‘Why not let her alone, old sport?'remarked Gatsby.‘You're the one that wanted to come to town.'

There was a moment of silence. The telephone book slipped from its nail and splashed to the floor, whereupon Jordan whispered，‘Excuse me'-but this time no one laughed.

‘I'll pick it up，'I offered.

‘I've got it.'Gatsby examined the parted string, muttered，‘Hum！'in an interested way, and tossed the book on a chair.

‘That's a great expression of yours, isn't it?'said Tom sharply.

‘What is?'

‘All this“old sport”business. Where'd you pick that up?'

‘Now see here, Tom，'said Daisy, turning around from the mirror，‘if you're going to make personal remarks I won't stay here a minute. Call up and order some ice for the mint julep.'

As Tom took up the receiver the compressed heat exploded into sound and we were listening to the portentous chords ofMendelssohn's Wedding March from the ballroom below.

‘Imagine marrying anybody in this heat！'cried Jordan dismally.

‘Still-I was married in the middle of June，'Daisy remembered，‘Louisville in June！Somebody fainted. Who was it fainted, Tom?'

‘Biloxi，'he answered shortly.

‘A man named Biloxi.“Blocks”Biloxi, and he made boxes-that's a fact-and he was from Biloxi, Tennessee.'

‘They carried him into my house，'appended Jordan，‘because we lived just two doors from the church. And he stayed three weeks, until Daddy told him he had to get out.The day after he left Daddy died.'After a moment she added，‘There wasn't any connection.'

‘I used to know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis，'I remarked.

‘That was his cousin. I knew his whole family history before he left.He gave me an aluminium putter that I use today.

The music had died down as the ceremony began and now a long cheer floated in at the window, followed by intermittent cries of‘Yea-ea-ea！'and finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing began.

‘W e're getting old，'said Daisy.‘If we were young we'd rise and dance.'

‘Remember Biloxi，'Jordan warned her.‘Where'd you know him, Tom?'

‘Biloxi?'He concentrated with an effort.‘I didn't know him. He was a friend of Daisy's.'

‘He was not，'she denied.‘I'd never seen him before. He came down in the private car.'

‘Well, he said he knew you. He said he was raised in Louisville.Asa Bird brought him around at the last minute and asked if we had room for him.'

Jordan smiled.

‘He was probably bumming his way home. He told me he was president of your class at Yale.'

Tom and I looked at each other blankly.

‘Biloxi?'

‘First place, we didn't have any president-'

Gatsby's foot beat a short, restless tattoo and Tom eyed him suddenly.

‘By the way, M r Gatsby, I understand you're an Oxford man.'

‘Not exactly.'

‘Oh, yes, I understand you went to Oxford.'

‘Yes-I went there.'

A pause. Then Tom's voice incredulous and insulting：‘You must have gone there about the time Biloxi went to New Haven.'

Another pause. A waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice, but the silence was unbroken by his‘thank you'and the soft closing of the door.This tremendous detail was to be cleared up at last.

‘I told you I went there，'said Gatsby.

‘I heard you, but I'd like to know when.'

‘It was in 1919. I only stayed five months.That's why I can't really call myself an Oxford man.'

Tom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief. But we were all looking at Gatsby.

‘It was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the Armistice，'he continued.‘We could go to any of the universities in England or France.'

I wanted to get up and slap him on the back. I had one of those renewals of complete faith in him that I'd experienced before.

Daisy rose, smiling faintly, and went to the table.

‘Open the whiskey, Tom，'she ordered，‘and I'll make you a mint julep. Then you won't seem so stupid to yourself……Look at the mint！'

‘Wait a minute，'snapped Tom，‘I want to ask Mr Gatsby one more question.'

‘Go on，'Gatsby said politely.

‘What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow?'

They were out in the open at last and Gatsby was content.

‘He isn't causing a row，'Daisy looked desperately from one to the other.‘You're causing a row. Please have a little self-control.'

‘Self-control！'repeated Tom incredulously.‘I suppose the latest thing is to sit back and let M r Nobody from Nowhere make love to your wife. Well, if that's the idea you can count me out……Nowadays people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions, and next they'll throw everything overboard and have intermarriage between black and white.'

Flushed with his impassioned gibberish, he saw himself standing alone on the last barrier of civilisation.

‘W e're all white here，'murmured Jordan.

‘I know I'm not very popular. I don't give big parties.I suppose you've got to make your house into a pigsty in order to have any friends-in the modem world.'

Angry as I was, as we all were, I was tempted to laugh whenever he opened his mouth. The transition from libertine to prig was so complete.

‘I've got something to tellyou, old sport-'began Gatsby. But Daisy guessed at his intention.

‘Please, don't！'she interrupted helplessly.‘Please let's all go home. Why don't we all go home?'

‘That's a good idea.'I got up.‘Come on, Tom. Nobody wants a drink.'

‘I want to know what M r Gatsby has to tell me.'

‘Your wife doesn't love you，'said Gatsby.‘She's never loved you. She loves me.'

‘You must be crazy！'exclaimed Tom automatically.

Gatsby sprang to his feet, vivid with excitement.

‘She never loved you, do you hear?'he cried.‘She only married you because I was poor and she was tired of waiting for me. It was a terrible mistake, but in her heart she never loved anyone except me！'

At this point Jordan and I tried to go, but Tom and Gatsby insisted with competitive firmness that we remain-as though neither of them had anything to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake vicariously of their emotions.

‘Sit down, Daisy，'Tom's voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternal note.‘What's been going on?I want to hear all about it.'

‘I told you what's been going on，'said Gatsby.‘Going on for five years-and you didn't know.'

Tom turned to Daisy sharply.

‘You've been seeing this fellow for five years?'

‘Not seeing，'said Gatsby.‘No, we couldn't meet. But both of us loved each other all that time, old sport, and you didn't know.I used to laugh sometimes'-but there was no laughter in his eyes-‘to think that you didn't know.’

‘Oh-that's all.'Tom tapped his thick fingers together like a clergyman and leaned back in his chair.‘You're crazy！'he exploded.‘I can't speak about what happened five years ago because I didn’t know Daisy then-and I’ll be damned if I see how you got within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries to the back door. But all the rest of that’s a God-damned lie.Daisy loved me when she married me and she loves me now.’

‘No，'said Gatsby, shaking his head.

‘She does, though. The trouble is that sometimes she gets foolish ideas in her head and doesn't know what she's doing.'He nodded sagely.‘And what's more I love Daisy too.Once in a while I go off on a spree and make a fool of myself, but I always come back, and in my heart I love her all the time.'

‘You're revolting，'said Daisy. She turned to me, and her voice, dropping an octave lower, filled the room with thrilling scorn：‘Do you know why we left Chicago?I'm surprised that they didn't treat you to the story of that little spree.'

Gatsby walked over and stood beside her.

‘Daisy, that's all over now，'he said earnestly.‘It doesn't matter any more. Just tell him the truth-that you never loved him-and it's all wiped out for ever.'

She looked at him blindly.‘Why-how could I love him-possibly?'

‘You never loved him.'

She hesitated. Her eyes fell on Jordan and me with a sort of appeal, as though she realised at last what she was doing-and as though she had never, all along, intended doing anything at all.But it was done now.It was too late.

‘I never loved him，'she said, with perceptible reluctance.

‘Not at Kapiolani?'demanded T om suddenly.

‘No.'

From the ballroom beneath, muffled and suffocating chords were drifting up on hot waves of air.

‘Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep your shoes dry?'There was a husky tenderness in his tone……‘Daisy?'

‘Please don't.'Her voice was cold, but the rancour was gone from it. She looked at Gatsby.‘There, Jay，'she said-but her hand as she tried to light a cigarette was trembling.Suddenly she threw the cigarette and the burning match on the carpet.

‘Oh, you want too much！'she cried to Gatsby.‘I love you now-isn't that enough?I can't help what's past.'She began to sob helplessly.‘I did love him once-but I loved you too.’

Gatsby's eyes opened and closed.

‘You loved me too?'he repeated.

‘Even that's a lie，'said Tom savagely.‘She didn't know you were alive. Why-there're things between Daisy and me that you'll never know, things that neither of us can ever forget.’

The words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby.

‘I want to speak to Daisy alone，'he insisted.‘She's all excited now-'

‘Even alone I can't say I never loved Tom，'she admitted in a pitiful voice.‘It wouldn't be true.'

‘Of course it wouldn't，'agreed Tom.

She turned to her husband.‘As if it mattered to you，'she said.

‘Of course it matters. I'm going to take better care of you from now on.'

‘You don't understand，'said Gatsby, with a touch of panic.‘You're not going to take care of her any more.'

‘I'm not?'Tom opened his eyes wide and laughed. He could afford to control himself now.‘Why's that?'

‘Daisy's leaving you.'

‘Nonsense.'

‘I am, though，'she said with a visible effort.

‘She's not leaving me！'Tom's words suddenly leaned down over Gatsby.‘Certainly not for a common swindler who'd have to steal the ring he put on her finger.'

‘I won't stand this！'cried Daisy.‘Oh, please let's get out.'

‘Who are you, anyhow?'broke out Tom.‘You're one of that bunch that hangs around with Meyer Wolfsheim-that much I happen to know. I've made a little investigation into your affairs-and I'll carry it further tomorrow.'

‘You can suit yourself about that, old sport，'said Gatsby steadily.

‘I found out what your“drugstores”were.'He turned to us and spoke rapidly.‘He and this Wolfsheim bought up a lot of side-street drugstores here and in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the counter. That's one of his little stunts.I picked him for a bootlegger the first time I saw him, and I wasn't far wrong.'

‘What about it?'said Gatsby politely.‘I guess your friend Walter Chase wasn't too proud to come in on it.'

‘And you left him in the lurch, didn't you?You let him go to jail for a month over in New Jersey. God！You ought to hear Walter on the subject ofyou.'

‘He came to us dead broke. He was very glad to pick up some money, old sport.'

‘Don't you call me“old sport”！'cried Tom. Gatsby said nothing.‘Walter could have you up on the betting laws too, but Wolfsheim scared him into shutting his mouth.'

That unfamiliar yet recognisable look was back again in Gatsby's face.

‘That drugstore business was just small change，'continued Tom slowly，‘but you've got something on now that Walter's afraid to tell me about.'

I glanced at Daisy, who was staring terrified between Gatsby and her husband, and at Jordan, who had begun to balance an invisible but absorbing object on the tip of her chin. Then I turned back to Gatsby-and was startled at his expression.He looked-and this is said in all contempt for the babbled slander of his garden-as if he had‘killed a man'.For a moment the set of his face could be described in just that fantastic way.

It passed, and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy, denying everything, defending his name against accusations that had not been made. But with every word she was drawing further and farther into herself, so he gave that up, and only the dead dream fought on as the afternoon slipped away, trying to touch what was no longer tangible, struggling unhappily, undespairingly, towards that lost voice across the room.

The voice begged again to go.

‘Please, Tom！I can't stand this any more.'

Her frightened eyes told that whatever intentions, whatever courage she had had, were definitely gone.

‘You two start on home, Daisy，'said Tom.‘In M r Gatsby's car.'

She looked at Tom, alarmed now, but he insisted with magnanimous scorn.

‘Go on. He won't annoy you.I think he realises that his presumptuous little flirtation is over.'

They were gone, without a word, snapped out, made accidental, isolated, like ghosts, even from our pity.

After a moment Tom got up and began wrapping the unopened bottle of whiskey in the towel.

‘Want any of this stuff?Jordan?……Nick?'

I didn't answer.

‘Nick?'He asked again.

‘What?'

‘Want any?'

‘No……I just remembered that today's my birthday.'

I was thirty. Before me stretched the portentous, menacing road of a new decade.

It was seven o'clock when we got into the coupe with him and started for Long Island. Tom talked incessantly, exulting and laughing, but his voice was as remote from Jordan and me as the foreign clamour on the sidewalk or the tumult of the elevated overhead.Human sympathy has its limits, and we were content to let all their tragic arguments fade with the city lights behind.Thirty-the promise of a decade of loneliness, a thinning list of single men to know, a thinning briefcase of enthusiasm, thinning hair.But there was Jordan beside me, who, unlike Daisy, was too wise ever to carry well-forgotten dreams from age to age.As we passed over the dark bridge her wan face fell lazily against my coat's shoulder and the formidable stroke of thirty died away with the reassuring pressure of her hand.

So we drove on towards death through the cooling twilight.

The young Greek, Michaelis, who ran the coffee joint beside the ashheaps was the principal witness at the inquest. He had slept through the heat until after five, when he strolled over to the garage, and found George Wilson sick in his office-really sick, pale as his own pale hair and shaking all over.Michaelis advised him to go to bed, but Wilson refused, saying that he'd miss a lot of business if he did.While his neigh­bour was trying to persuade him a violent racket broke out overhead.

‘I've got my wife locked in up there，'explained Wilson calmly.‘She's going to stay there till the day after tomorrow, and then we're going to move away.'

Michaelis was astonished；they had been neighbours for four years, and Wilson had never seemed faintly capable of such a statement. Gen­erally he was one of these worn-out men：when he wasn't working, he sat on a chair in the doorway and stared at the people and the cars that passed along the road.When anyone spoke to him he invariably laughed in an agreeable, colourless way.He was his wife's man and not his own.

So naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had happened, but Wilson wouldn't say a word-instead he began to throw curious suspicious glances at his visitor and ask him what he'd been doing at certain times on certain days. Just as the latter was getting uneasy, some workmen came past the door bound for his restaurant, and Michaelis took the op­portunity to get away, intending to come back later.But he didn't.He supposed he forgot to, that's all.When he came outside again, a little after seven, he was reminded of the conversation because he heard Mrs Wilson's voice, loud and scolding, downstairs in the garage.

‘Beat me！'he heard her cry.‘Throw me down and beat me, you dirty little coward！'

A moment later she rushed out into the dusk, waving her hands and shouting-before he could move from his door the business was over.

The‘death car'as the newspapers called it, didn't stop；it came out of the gathering darkness, wavered tragically for a moment, and then disappeared around the next bend. Mavromichaelis wasn't even sure of its colour-he told the first policeman that it was light green.The other car, the one going towards New York, came to rest a hundred yards beyond, and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson, her life violently extinguished, knelt in the road and mingled her thick dark blood with the dust.

Michaelis and this man reached her first, but when they had tom open her shirtwaist, still damp with perspiration, they saw that her left breast was swinging loose like a flap, and there was no need to listen for the heart beneath. The mouth was wide open and ripped a little at the comers, as though she had choked a little in giving up the tremendous vitality she had stored so long.

We saw the three or four automobiles and the crowd when we were still some distance away.

‘Wreck！'said Tom.‘That's good. Wilson'll have a little business at last.'

He slowed down, but still without any intention of stopping, until, as we came nearer, the hushed, intent faces of the people at the garage door made him automatically put on his brakes.

‘W e'll take a look，'he said doubtfully，‘just a look.'

I became aware now of a hollow, wailing sound which issued incessantly from the garage, a sound which as we got out of the coupe and walked towards the door resolved itself into the words，‘Oh, my God！'uttered over and over in a gasping moan.

‘There's some bad trouble here，'said Tom excitedly.

He reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the garage, which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging metal basket overhead. Then he made a harsh sound in his throat, and with a violent thrusting movement of his powerful arms pushed his way through.

The circle closed up again with a running murmur of expostulation；it was a minute before I could see anything at all. Then new arrivals deranged the line, andJordan and I were pushed suddenly inside.

Myrtle Wilson's body, wrapped in a blanket, and then in another blanket, as though she suffered from a chill in the hot night, lay on a work-table by the wall, and Tom, with his back to us, was bending over it, motionless. Next to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking down names with much sweat and correction in a little book.At first I couldn't find the source of the high, groaning words that echoed clamorously through the bare garage-then I saw Wilson standing on the raised threshold of his office, swaying back and forth and holding to the doorposts with both hands.Some man was talking to him in a low voice and attempting, from time to time, to lay a hand on his shoulder, but Wilson neither heard nor saw.His eyes would drop slowly from the swinging light to the laden table by the wall, and then jerk back to the light again, and he gave out incessantly his high, horrible call：‘Oh, my Ga-od！Oh, my Ga-od！Oh, Ga-od！Oh, my Ga-od！'

Presently Tom lifted his head with a jerk and, after staring around the garage with glazed eyes, addressed a mumbled incoherent remark to the policeman.

‘M, a，v-'the policeman was saying，‘o-'

‘No, r，'corrected the man，‘M, a，v, r，o-'

‘Listen to me！'muttered Tom fiercely.

‘r，'said the policeman，‘o-'

'g.'

‘g.'He looked up as Tom's broad hand fell sharply on his shoulder.‘What you want, fella?'

‘What happened?-that's what I want to know.'

‘Auto hit her. Instandy killed.'

‘Instandy killed，'repeated Tom, staring.

‘She ran out in a road. Son-of-a-bitch didn't even stop car.'

‘There was two cars，'said Michaelis，‘one coming, one going, see?'

‘Going where?'asked the policeman keenly.

‘One going each way. Well, she'-his hand rose towards the blankets but stopped halfway and fell to his side-‘she ran out there and the one coming from New York knock right into her, going thirty or forty miles hour.'

‘What's the name of this place here?'demanded the officer.

‘Hasn't got any name.'

A pale well-dressed negro stepped near.

‘It was a yellow car，'he said，‘big yellow car. New.'

‘See the accident?'asked the policeman.

‘No, but the car passed me down die road, going faster than forty. Going fifty, sixty.'

‘Come here and let's have your name. Look out now.I want to get his name.'

Some words of this conversation must have reached Wilson, swaying in the office door, for suddenly a new theme found voice among his gasping cries：‘You don't have to tell me what kind of car it was！I know what kind of car it was！'

Watching Tom, I saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten under his coat. He walked quickly over to Wilson and, standing in front of him, seized him firmly by the upper arms.

‘You've got to pull yourself together，'he said with soothing gruffness.

Wilson's eyes fell upon Tom；he started up on his tiptoes and then would have collapsed to his knees had not Tom held him upright.

‘Listen，'said Tom, shaking him a little.‘I just got here a minute ago, from New York. I was bringing you that coupe we've been talking about.That yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasn't mine-do you hear?I haven't seen it all afternoon.'

Only the negro and I were near enough to hear what he said, but the policeman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent eyes.

‘What's all that?'he demanded.

‘I'm a friend of his.'Tom turned his head but kept his hands firm on Wilson's body.‘He says he knows the car that did i t……It was a yellow car.'

Some dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspiciously at Tom.

‘And what colour's your car?'

‘It's a blue car, a coupe.'

‘W e've come straight from New York，'I said.

Someone who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this, and the policeman turned away.

‘Now, if you'll letme have that name again correct-'

Picking up Wilson like a doll, Tom carried him into the office, set him down in a chair, and came back.

‘If somebody'll come here and sit with him，'he snapped authorit­atively. He watched while the two men standing closest glanced at each other and went unwillingly into the room.Then Tom shut the door on them and came down the single step, his eyes avoiding the table.As he passed close to me he whispered：‘Let's get out.'

Self-consciously, with his authoritative arms breaking the way, we pushed through the still-gathering crowd, passing a hurried doctor, case in hand, who had been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago.

Tom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend-then his foot came down hard, and the coupe raced along through the night. In a little while I heard a low husky sob, and saw that the tears were overflowing down his face.

‘The God-damned coward！'he whimpered.‘He didn't even stop his car.'

The Buchanans'house floated suddenly towards us through the dark rustling trees. Tom stopped beside the porch and looked up at the second floor, where two windows bloomed with light among the vines.

‘Daisy's home，'he said. As we got out of the car he glanced at me and frowned slightly.

‘I ought to have dropped you in West Egg, Nick. There's nothing we can do tonight.'

A change had come over him, and he spoke gravely, and with decision. As we walked across the moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed of the situation in a few brisk phrases.

‘I'll telephone for a taxi to take you home, and while you're waiting you and Jordan better go in the kitchen and have them get you some supper-if you want any.'He opened the door.‘Come in.'

‘No, thanks. But I'd be glad if you'd order me the taxi.I'll wait outside.'

Jordan put her hand on my arm.

‘Won't you come in, Nick?'

‘No, thanks.'

I was feeling a little sick and I wanted to be alone. But Jordan lingered for a moment more.

‘It's only half-past nine，'she said.

I'd be damned if I'd go in；I'd had enough of all of them for one day, and suddenly that included Jordan too. She must have seen something of this in my expression, for she turned abruptly away and ran up the porch steps into the house.I sat down for a few minutes with my head in my hands, until I heard the phone taken up inside and the butler's voice calling a taxi.Then I walked slowly down the drive away from the house, intending to wait by the gate.

I hadn't gone twenty yards when I heard my name and Gatsby stepped from between two bushes into the path. I must have felt pretty weird by that time, because I could think of nothing except the luminosity of his pink suit under the moon.

‘What are you doing?'I enquired.

‘Just standing here, old sport.'

Somehow, that seemed a despicable occupation. For all I knew he was going to rob the house in a moment；I wouldn't have been surprised to see sinister faces, the faces o f‘Wolfsheim's people'，behind him in the dark shrubbery.

‘Did you see any trouble on the road?'he asked after a minute.

‘Yes.'

He hesitated.

‘Was she killed?'

‘Yes.'

‘I thought so；I told Daisy I thought so. It's better that the shock should all come at once.She stood it pretty well.'

He spoke as if Daisy's reaction was the only thing that mattered.

‘I got to West Egg by a side road，'he went on，‘and left the car in my garage. I don't think anybody saw us, but of course I can't be sure.'

I disliked him so much by this time that I didn't find it necessary to tell him he was wrong.

‘Who was the woman?'he enquired.

‘Her name was Wilson. Her husband owns the garage.How the devil did it happen?'

‘Well, I tried to swing the wheel-'He broke off, and suddenly I guessed at the truth.

‘Was Daisy driving?'

‘Yes，'he said after a moment，‘but of course I'll say I was. You see, when we left New York she was very nervous and she thought it would steady her to drive-and this woman rushed out at us just as we were passing a car coming the other way.It all happened in a minute, but it seemed to me that she wanted to speak to us, thought we were somebody she knew.Well, first Daisy turned away from the woman towards the other car, and then she lost her nerve and turned back.The second my hand reached the wheel I felt the shock-it must have killed her instantly.'

‘It ripped her open-'

‘Don't tell me, old sport.'He winced.‘Anyhow-Daisy stepped on it. I tried to make her stop, but she couldn't, so I pulled on the emergency brake.Then she fell over into my lap and I drove on.

‘She'll be all right tomorrow，'he said presently.‘I'm just going to wait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness this afternoon. She's locked herself into her room, and if he tries any brutality she's going to turn the light out and on again.’

‘He won't touch her，'I said.‘He's not thinking about her.'

‘I don't trust him, old sport.'

‘How long are you going to wait?'

‘All night, if necessary. Anyhow, till they all go to bed.'

A new point of view occurred to me. Suppose Tom found out that Daisy had been driving.He might think he saw a connection in it-he might think anything.I looked at the house；there were two or three bright windows downstairs and the pink glow from Daisy's room on the second floor.

‘You wait here，'I said.‘I'll see if there's any sign of a commotion.'

I walked back along the border of the lawn, traversed the gravel softly, and tiptoed up the veranda steps. The drawing-room curtains were open, and I saw that the room was empty.Crossing the porch where we had dined that June night three months before, I came to a small rectangle of light which I guessed was the pantry window.The blind was drawn, but I found a rift at the sill.

Daisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table, with a plate of cold fried chicken between them, and two bottles of ale. He was talking intently across the table at her, and in his earnestness his hand had fallen upon and covered her own.Once in a while she looked up at him and nodded in agreement.

They weren't happy, and neither of them had touched the chicken or the ale-and yet they weren't unhappy either. There was an unmistakable air of natural intimacy about the picture, and anybody would have said that they were conspiring together.

As I tiptoed from the porch I heard my taxi feeling its way along the dark drive towards the house. Gatsby was waiting where I had left him in the drive.

‘Is it all quiet up there?'he asked anxiously.

‘Yes, it's all quiet.'I hesitated.‘You'd better come home and get some sleep.'

He shook his head.

‘I want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed. Good-night, old sport.'

He put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his scrutiny of the house, as though my presence marred the sacredness of the vigil. So I walked away and left him standing there in the moonlight-watching over nothing.





CHAPTER 8


I couldn't sleep all night；a fog-horn was groaning incessantly on the Sound, and I tossed half-sick between grotesque reality and savage, frightening dreams. Towards dawn I heard a taxi go up Gatsby's drive, and immediately I jumped out of bed and began to dress-1 felt that I had something to tell him, something to warn him about, and morning would be too late.

Crossing his lawn, I saw that his front door was still open and he was leaning against a table in the hall, heavy with dejection or sleep.

‘Nothing happened，'he said wanly.‘I waited, and about four o'clock she came to the window and stood there for a minute and then turned out the light.'

His house had never seemed so enormous to me as it did that night when we hunted through the great rooms for cigarettes. We pushed aside curtains that were like pavilions, and felt over innumerable feet of dark wall for electric light switches-once I tumbled with a sort of splash upon the keys of a ghostly piano.There was an inexplicable amount of dust everywhere, and the rooms were musty, as though they hadn't been aired for many days.I found the humidor on an unfamiliar table, with two stale, dry cigarettes inside.Throwing open the French windows of the drawing-room, we sat smoking out into the darkness.

‘You ought to go away，'I said.‘It's pretty certain they'll trace your car.'

‘Go away now, old sport?'

‘Go to Atlantic City for a week, or up to Montreal.'

He wouldn't consider it. He couldn't possibly leave Daisy until he knew what she was going to do.He was clutching at some last hope and I couldn't bear to shake him free.

It was this night that he told me the strange story of his youth with Dan Cody-told it to me because‘Jay Gatsby'had broken up like glass against Tom's hard malice, and the long secret extravaganza was played out. I think that he would have acknowledged anything now, without reserve, but he wanted to talk about Daisy.

She was the first‘nice girl'he had ever known. In various unrevealed capacities he had come in contact with such people, but always with indiscernible barbed wire between.He found her excitingly desirable.He went to her house, at first with other officers from Camp Taylor, then alone.It amazed him-he had never been in such a beautiful house before.But what gave it an air of breathless intensity was that Daisy lived there-it was as casual a thing to her as his tent out at camp was to him.There was a ripe mystery about it, a hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other bedrooms, of gay and radiant activities taking place through its corridors, and of romances that were not musty and laid away already in lavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this year's shining motor cars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely withered.It excited him, too, that many men had already loved Daisy-it increased her value in his eyes.He felt their presence all about the house, pervading the air with the shades and echoes of still vibrant emotions.

But he knew that he was in Daisy's house by a colossal accident. However glorious might be his future asJay Gatsby, he was at present a penniless young man without a past, and at any moment the invisible cloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders.So he made the most of his time.He took what he could get, ravenously and unscrupulously-eventually he took Daisy one still October night, took her because he had no real right to touch her hand.

He might have despised himself, for he had certainly taken her under false pretences. I don't mean that he had traded on his phantom millions, but he had deliberately given Daisy a sense of security；he let her believe that he was a person from much the same strata as herself-that he was fully able to take care of her.As a matter of fact, he had no such facilities-he had no comfortable family standing behind him, and he was liable at the whim of an impersonal government to be blown anywhere about the world.

But he didn't despise himself and it didn't turn out as he had imagined. He had intended, probably, to take what he could and go-but now he found that he had committed himself to the following of a grail.He knew that Daisy was extraordinary, but he didn't realise just how extraordinary a‘nice'girl could be.She vanished into her rich house, into her rich, full life, leaving Gatsby-nothing.He felt married to her, that was all.

When they met again, two days later, it was Gatsby who was breathless, who was, somehow, betrayed. Her porch was bright with the bought luxury of star-shine；the wicker of the settee squeaked fashionably as she turned towards him and he kissed her curious and lovely mouth.She had caught a cold, and it made her voice huskier and more charming than ever, and Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many clothes, and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor.

‘I can't describe to you how surprised I was to find out I loved her, old sport. I even hoped for a while that she'd throw me over, but she didn't, because she was in love with me too.She thought I knew a lot because I knew different things from her……Well, there I was, way off my ambitions, getting deeper in love every minute, and all of a sudden I didn't care.What was the use of doing great things if I could have a better time telling her what I was going to do?'

On the last afternoon before he went abroad, he sat with Daisy in his arms for a long, silent time. It was a cold fall day, with fire in the room and her cheeks flushed.Now and then she moved and he changed his arm a little, and once he kissed her dark shining hair.The afternoon had made them tranquil for a while, as if to give them a deep memory for the long parting the next day promised.They had never been closer in their month of love, nor communicated more profoundly one with another, than when she brushed silent lips against his coat's shoulder or when he touched the end of her fingers, gently, as though she were asleep.

He did extraordinarily well in the war. He was a captain before he went to the front, and following the Argonne battles he got his majority and the command of the divisional machine-guns.After the Armistice he tried frantically to get home, but some complication or misunderstand­ing sent him to Oxford instead.He was worried now-there was a quality of nervous despair in Daisy's letters.She didn't see why he couldn't come.She was feeling the pressure of the world outside, and she wanted to see him and feel his presence beside her and be reassured that she was doing the right thing after all.

For Daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent of orchids and pleasant, cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of the year, slimming up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new tunes. All night the saxophones wailed the hopeless comment of the Beale Street Blues while a hundred pairs of golden and silver slippers shuffled the shining dust.At the grey tea hour there were always rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low, sweet fever, while fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by the sad horns around the floor.

Through this twilight universe Daisy began to move again with the season；suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with half a dozen men, and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and chiffon of an evening dress tangled among dying orchids on the floor beside her bed. And all the time something within her was crying for a decision.She wanted her life shaped now, immediately-and the decision must be made by some force—of love, of money, of unquestionable practicality-that was close at hand.

That force took shape in the middle of spring with the arrival of Tom Buchanan. There was a wholesome bulkiness about his person and his position, and Daisy was flattered.Doubtless there was a certain struggle and a certain relief.The letter reached Gatsby while he was still at Oxford.

It was dawn now on Long Island and we went about opening the rest of the windows downstairs, filling the house with grey-turning, gold-turning light. The shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the dew and ghostly birds began to sing among the blue leaves.There was a slow, pleasant movement in the air, scarcely a wind, promising a cool, lovely day.

‘I don't think she ever loved him，'Gatsby turned around from a window and looked at me challengingly.‘You must remember, old sport, she was very excited this afternoon. He told her those things in a way that frightened her-that made it look as if I was some kind of cheap sharper.And the result was she hardly knew what she was saying.'

He sat down gloomily.

‘O f course she might have loved him just for a minute, when they were first married-and loved me more even then, do you see?'

Suddenly he came out with a curious remark.

‘In any case，'he said，‘it was just personal.'

What could you make of that, except to suspect some intensity in his conception of the affair that couldn't be measured?

He came back from France when Tom and Daisy were still on their wedding trip, and made a miserable but irresistible journey to Louisville on the last of his army pay. He stayed there a week, walking the streets where their footsteps had clicked together through the November night and revisiting the out-of-the-way places to which they had driven in her white car.Just as Daisy's house had always seemed to him more mysterious and gay than other houses, so his idea of the city itself, even though she was gone from it, was pervaded with a melancholy beauty.

He left, feeling that if he had searched harder, he might have found her-that he was leaving her behind. The day-coach-he was penniless now-was hot.He went out to the open vestibule and sat down on a folding-chair, and the station slid away and the backs of unfamiliar buildings moved by.Then out into the spring fields, where a yellow trolley raced them for a minute with people in it who might once have seen the pale magic of her face along the casual street.

The track curved and now it was going away from the sun, which, as it sank lower, seemed to spread itself in benediction over the vanishing city where she had drawn her breath. He stretched out his hand desperately as if to snatch only a wisp of air, to save a fragment of the spot that she had made lovely for him.But it was all going by too fast now for his blurred eyes and he knew that he had lost that part of it, the freshest and the best, forever.

It was nine o'clock when we finished breakfast and went out on the porch. The night had made a sharp difference in the weather and there was an autumn flavour in the air.The gardener, the last one of Gatsby's former servants, came to the foot of the steps.

‘I'm going to drain the pool today, Air Gatsby. Leaves'll start falling pretty soon, and then there's always trouble with the pipes.'

‘Don't do it today，'Gatsby answered. He turned to me apologet­ically.‘You know, old sport, I've never used that pool all summer.'

I looked at my watch and stood up.

‘Twelve minutes to my train.'

I didn't want to go to the city. I wasn't worth a decent stroke of work, but it was more than that-I didn't want to leave Gatsby.I missed that train, and then another, before I could get myself away.

‘I'll call you up，'I said finally.

‘Do, old sport.'

‘I'll call you about noon.'

We walked slowly down the steps.

‘I suppose Daisy'll call too.'He looked at me anxiously, as if he hoped I'd corroborate this.

‘I suppose so.'

‘Well, goodbye.'

We shook hands and I started away. Just before I reached the hedge I remembered something and turned around.

‘They're a rotten crowd，'I shouted across the lawn.‘You're worth the whole damn bunch put together.'

I've always been glad I said that. It was the only compliment I ever gave him, because I disapproved of him from beginning to end.First he nodded politely, and then his face broke into that radiant and understanding smile, as if we'd been in ecstatic cahoots on that fact all the time.His gorgeous pink rag of a suit made a bright spot of colour against the white steps, and I thought of the night when I first came to his ancestral home, three months before.The lawn and drive had been crowded with the faces of those who guessed at his corruption-and he had stood on those steps, concealing his incorruptible dream, as he waved them goodbye.

I thanked him for his hospitality. We were always thanking him for that-1 and the others.

‘Goodbye，'I called.‘I enjoyed breakfast, Gatsby.'

Up in the city, I tried for a while to list the quotations on an interminable amount of stock, then I fell asleep in my swivel-chair. Just before noon the phone woke me, and I started up with sweat breaking out on my forehead.It wasJordan Baker；she often called me up at this hour because die uncertainty of her own movements between hotels and clubs and private houses made her hard to find in any other way.Usually her voice came over the wire as something fresh and cool, as if a divot from a green golf-links had come sailing in at the office window, but this morning it seemed harsh and dry.

‘I've left Daisy's house，'she said.‘I'm at Hempstead, and I'm going down to Southampton this afternoon.’

Probably it had been tactful to leave Daisy's house, but the act annoyed me, and her next remark made me rigid.

‘You weren't so nice to me last night.'

‘How could it have mattered then?'

Silence for a moment. Then：‘However-1 want to see you.'

‘I want to see you, too.'

‘Suppose I don't go to Southampton, and come into town this afternoon?'

‘No-I don't think this afternoon.'

‘Very well.'

‘It's impossible this afternoon. Various-'

We talked like that for a while, and then abruptly we weren't talking any longer. I don't know which of us hung up with a sharp click, but I know I didn't care.I couldn't have talked to her across a tea-table that day if I never talked to her again in this world.

I called Gatsby's house a few minutes later, but the line was busy. I tried four times；finally an exasperated central told me the wire was being kept open for long distance from Detroit.Taking out my time­table, I drew a small circle around the three-fifty train.Then I leaned back in my chair and tried to think.It was just noon.

When I passed the ashheaps on the train that morning I had crossed deliberately to the other side of the car. I supposed there'd be a curious crowd around there all day with little boys searching for dark spots in the dust, and some garrulous man telling over and over what had happened, until it became less and less real even to him and he could tell it no longer, and Myrtle Wilson's tragic achievement was forgotten.Now I want to go back a little and tell what happened at the garage after we left there the night before.

They had difficulty in locating the sister, Catherine. She must have broken her rule against drinking that night, for when she arrived she was stupid with liquor and unable to understand that the ambulance had already gone to Flushing.When they convinced her of this, she immediately fainted, as if that was the intolerable part of the affair.Someone, kind or curious, took her in his car and drove her in the wake of her sister's body.

Until long after midnight a changing crowd lapped up against the front of the garage, while George Wilson rocked himself back and forth on the couch inside. For a while the door of the office was open, and everyone who came into the garage glanced irresistibly through it.Finally someone said it was a shame, and closed the door.Michaelis and several other men were with him；first, four or five men, later two or three men.Still later Michaelis had to ask the last stranger to wait there fifteen minutes longer while he went back to his own place and made a pot of coffee.After that, he stayed there alone with Wilson until dawn.

About three o'clock the quality of Wilson's incoherent muttering changed-he grew quieter and began to talk about the yellow car. He announced that he had a way of finding out whom the yellow car belonged to, and then he blurted out that a couple of months ago his wife had come from the city with her face bruised and her nose swollen.

But when he heard himself say this, he flinched and began to cry，'Oh, my God！'again in his groaning voice. Michaelis made a clumsy attempt to distract him.

'How long have you been married, George?Come on there, try and sit still a minute and answer my question. How long have you been married?'

'Twelve years.'

'Ever had any children?Come on, George, sit still-I asked you a question. Did you ever have any children?'

The hard brown beeTLes kept thudding against the dull light, and whenever Michaelis heard a car go tearing along the road outside it sounded to him like the car that hadn't stopped a few hours before. He didn't like to go into the garage, because the work bench was stained where the body had been lying, so he moved uncomfortably around the office-he knew every object in it before morning-and from time to time sat down beside Wilson, trying to keep him more quiet.

‘Have you got a church you go to sometimes, George?Maybe even if you haven't been there for a long time?Maybe I could call up the church and get a priest to come over and he could talk to you, see?'

‘Don't belong to any.'

'You ought to have a church, George, for times like this. You must have gone to church once.Didn't you get married in a church?Listen, George, listen to me.Didn't you get married in a church?'

'That was a long time ago.'

The effort of answering broke the rhythm of his rocking-for a moment he was silent. Then the same half-knowing, half-bewildered look came back into his faded eyes.

‘Look in the drawer there，'he said, pointing at the desk.

‘Which drawer?'

'That drawer-that one.'

Michaelis opened the drawer nearest his hand. There was nothing in it but a small, expensive dog-leash, made of leather and braided silver.It was apparently new.

‘This?'he enquired, holding it up.

Wilson stared and nodded.‘I found it yesterday afternoon. She tried to tell me about it, but I knew it was something funny.'

‘You mean your wife bought it?'

‘She had it wrapped in tissue paper on her bureau.'

Michaelis didn't see anything odd in that, and he gave Wilson a dozen reasons why his wife might have bought the dog-leash. But conceivably Wilson had heard some of these same explanations before, from Myrtle, because he began saying，‘Oh, my God！'again in a whisper-his comforter left several explanations in the air.

‘Then he killed her，'said Wilson. His mouth dropped open suddenly.

‘Who did?'

‘I have a way of finding out.'

‘You're morbid, George，'said his friend.‘This has been a strain to you and you don't know what you're saying. You'd better try and sit quiet till morning.’

‘He murdered her.'

‘It was an accident, George.'

Wilson shook his head. His eyes narrowed and his mouth widened slightly with the ghost of a superior，‘Hm！'

‘I know，'he said definitely，‘I'm one of these trusting fellas and I don't think any harm to nobody, but when I get to know a thing I know it. It was the man in that car.She ran out to speak to him and he wouldn't stop.'

Michaelis had seen this too, but it hadn't occurred to him that there was any special significance in it. He believed that Mrs Wilson had been running away from her husband, rather than trying to stop any particular car.

‘How could she of been like that?'

‘She's a deep one，'said Wilson, as if that answered the question.‘A h-h-h-'

He began to rock again, and Michaelis stood twisting the leash in his hand.

‘Maybe you got some friend that I could telephone for, George?'

This was a forlorn hope-he was almost sure that Wilson had no friend：there was not enough of him for his wife. He was glad a little later when he noticed a change in the room, a blue quickening by the window, and realised that dawn wasn't far off.About five o'clock it was blue enough outside to snap off the light.

Wilson's glazed eyes turned out to the ashheaps, where small grey clouds took on fantastic shapes and scurried here and there in the faint dawn wind.

‘I spoke to her，'he muttered, after a long silence.‘I told her she might fool me but she couldn't fool God. I took her to the window'-with an effort he got up and walked to the rear window and leaned with his face pressed against it-‘and I said，“God knows what you've been doing, everything you've been doing.You may fool me, but you can't fool God！”’

Standing behind him, Michaelis saw with a shock that he was looking at the eyes of Doctor T. J.Eckleburg, which had just emerged, pale and enormous, from the dissolving night.

‘God sees everything，'repeated Wilson.

‘That's an advertisement，'Michaelis assured him. Something made him turn away from the window and look back into the room.But Wilson stood there a long time, his face close to the window pane, nodding into the twilight.

By six o'clock Michaelis was worn out, and grateful for the sound of a car stopping outside. It was one of the watchers of the night before who had promised to come back, so he cooked breakfast for three, which he and the other man ate together.Wilson was quieter now, and Michaelis went home to sleep；when he awoke four hours later and hurried back to the garage, Wilson was gone.

His movements-he was on foot all the time-were afterwards traced to Port Roosevelt and then to Gad's Hill, where he bought a sandwich, that he didn't eat, and a cup of coffee. He must have been tired and walking slowly, for he didn't reach Gad's Hill until noon.Thus far there was no difficulty in accounting for his time-there were boys who had seen a man‘acting sort of crazy'，and motorists at whom he stared oddly from the side of the road.Then for three hours he disappeared from view.The police, on the strength of what he said to Michaelis, that he‘had a way of finding out’，supposed that he spent that time going from garage to garage thereabouts, enquiring for a yellow car.On the other hand, no garage man who had seen him ever came forward, and perhaps he had an easier, surer way of finding out what he wanted to know.By half-past two he was in West Egg, where he asked someone the way to Gatsby’s house.So by that time he knew Gatsby’s name.

At two o'clock Gatsby put on his bathing-suit and left word with the butler that if anyone phoned word was to be brought to him at the pool. He stopped at the garage for a pneumatic mattress that had amused his guests during die summer, and the chauffeur helped him pump it up.Then he gave instructions that the open car wasn't to be taken out under any circumstances-and this was strange, because the front right fender needed repair.

Gatsby shouldered the mattress and started for the pool. Once he stopped and shifted it a little, and the chauffeur asked him if he needed help, but he shook his head and in a moment disappeared among the yellowing trees.

No telephone message arrived, but the butler went without his sleep and waited for it until four o'clock-until long after there was anyone to give it to if it came. I have an idea that Gatsby himself didn't believe it would come, and perhaps he no longer cared.If that was true he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a high price for living too long with a single dream.He must have looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was upon the scarcely created grass.A new world, material without being real, where poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, drifted fortuitously about……like that ashen, fantastic figure gliding towards him through the amorphous trees.

The chauffeur-he was one of Wolfsheim's protégés-heard the shots-afterwards he could only say that he hadn’t thought anything much about them.I drove from the station directly to Gatsby’s house and my rushing anxiously up the front steps was the first thing that alarmed anyone.But they knew then, I firmly believe.With scarcely a word said, four of us, the chauffeur, butler, gardener and I, hurried down to the pool.

There was a faint, barely perceptible movement of the water as the fresh flow from one end urged its way towards the drain at the other. With little ripples that were hardly the shadows ofwaves, the laden mat­tress moved irregularly down the pool.A small gust ofwind that scarcely corrugated the surface was enough to disturb its accidental course with its accidental burden.The touch of a cluster of leaves revolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of transit, a thin red circle in the water.

It was after we started with Gatsby towards the house that the gardener saw Wilson's body a little way off in the grass, and the holocaust was complete.





CHAPTER 9


After two years I remember the rest of that day, and that night and the next day, only as an endless drill of police and photographers and newspaper men in and out of Gatsby's front door. A rope stretched across the main gate and a policeman by it kept out the curious, but little boys soon discovered that they could enter through my yard, and there were always a few of them clustered open-mouthed about the pool.Someone with a positive manner, perhaps a detective, used the expression‘madman'as he bent over Wilson's body that afternoon, and the adventitious authority of his voice set the key for the newspaper reports next morning.

Most of those reports were a nightmare-grotesque, circumstantial, eager and untrue. When Michaelis's testimony at the inquest brought to light Wilson's suspicions ofhis wife I thought the whole tale would shortly be served up in racy pasquinade-but Catherine, who might have said anything, didn't say a word.She showed a surprising amount of charac­ter about it too-looked at the coroner with determined eyes under that corrected brow of hers, and swore that her sister had never seen Gatsby, that her sister was completely happy with her husband, that her sister had been into no mischiefwhatever.She convinced herselfof it, and cried into her handkerchief, as if the very suggestion was more than she could endure.So Wilson was reduced to a man‘deranged by grief'in order that the case might remain in its simplest form.And it rested there.

But all this part of it seemed remote and unessential. I found myself on Gatsby's side, and alone.From the moment I telephoned news of the catastrophe to West Egg village, every surmise about him, and every practical question, was referred to me.At first I was surprised and confused；then, as he lay in his house and didn't move or breathe or speak, hour upon hour, it grew upon me that I was responsible, because no one else was interested-interested, I mean, with that intense personal interest to which everyone has some vague right at the end.

I called up Daisy half an hour after we found him, called her instinctively and without hesitation. But she and Tom had gone away early that afternoon, and taken baggage with them.

‘Left no address?'

‘No.'

‘Say when they'd be back?'

‘No.'

‘Any idea where they are?How I could reach them?'

‘I don't know. Can't say.'

I wanted to get somebody for him. I wanted to go into the room where he lay and reassure him：‘I'll get somebody for you, Gatsby.Don't worry.Just trust me and I'll get somebody for you-'

Meyer Wolfsheim's name wasn't in the phone book. The butler gave me his once address on Broadway, and I called Information, but by the time I had the number it was long after five, and no one answered the phone.

‘Will you ring again?'

‘I've rung them three times.'

‘It's very important.'

‘Sorry. I'm afraid no one's there.'

I went back to the drawing-room and thought for an instant that they were chance visitors, all these official people who suddenly filled it. But, though they drew back the sheet and looked at Gatsby with shocked eyes, his protest continued in my brain：‘Look here, old sport, you've got to get somebody for me.You've got to try hard.I can't go through this alone.'

Someone started to ask me questions, but I broke away and going upstairs looked hastily through the unlocked parts of his desk-he'd never told me definitely that his parents were dead. But there was nothing-only the picture of Dan Cody, a token of forgotten violence, staring down from the wall.

Next morning I sent the butler to New York with a letter to Wolfsheim, which asked for information and urged him to come out on the next train. That request seemed superfluous when I wrote it.I was sure he'd start when he saw the newspapers, just as I was sure there'd be a wire from Daisy before noon-but neither a wire nor Mr Wolfsheim arrived；no one arrived except more police and photo­graphers and newspaper men.When the butler brought back Wolfsheim's answer I began to have a feeling of defiance, of scornful solidarity between Gatsby and me against them all.

Dear Mr Carraway，

This has been one of the most terrible shocks of my life to me I hardly can believe it that it is true at all.Such a mad act as that man did should make us all think.I cannot come down now as I am tied up in some very important business and cannot get mixed up in this thing now.If there is anything I can do a little later let me know in a letter by Edgar.I hardly know where I am when I hear about a thing like this and am completely knocked down and out.

Yours truly

Meyer Wolfsheim

and then hasty addenda beneath：

Let me know about the funeral etc. do not know his family at all.

When the phone rang that afternoon and Long Distance said Chicago was calling I thought this would be Daisy at last. But the connection came through as a man's voice, very thin and far away.

‘This is Slagle speaking……'

‘Yes?'The name was unfamiliar.

‘Hell of a note, isn't it?Get my wire?'

‘There haven't been any wires.'

‘Young Parke's in trouble，'he said rapidly.‘They picked him up when he handed the bonds over the counter. They got a circular from New York giving them the numbers just five minutes before.What did you know about that, hey?You never can tell in these hick towns ‘Hello！'I interrupted breathlessly.‘Look here-this isn't M r Gatsby. Mr Gatsby's dead.'

There was a long silence on the other end of the wire, followed by an exclamation……then a quick squawk as the connection was broken.

I think it was on the third day that a telegram signed Henry C. Gatz arrived from a town in Minnesota.It said only that the sender was leaving immediately and to postpone the funeral until he came.

It was Gatsby's father, a solemn old man, very helpless and dismayed, bundled up in a long cheap ulster against the warm September day. His eyes leaked continuously with excitement, and when I took the bag and umbrella from his hands he began to pull so incessantly at his sparse grey beard that I had difficulty in getting off his coat.He was on the point of collapse, so I took him into the music-room and made him sit down while I sent for something to eat.But he wouldn't eat, and the glass of milk spilled from his trembling hand.

‘I saw it in the Chicago newspaper，'he said.‘It was all in the Chicago newspaper. I started right away.'

‘I didn't know how to reach you.'

His eyes, seeing nothing, moved ceaselessly about the room.

‘It was a madman，'he said.‘He must have been mad.'

‘Wouldn't you like some coffee?'I urged him.

‘I don't want anything. I'm all right now, Mr-'

‘Carraway.'

‘Well, I'm all right now. Where have they gotJimmy?'

I took him into the drawing-room, where his son lay, and left him there. Some little boys had come up on the steps and were looking into the hall；when I told them who had arrived, they went reluctantly away.

After a little while M r Gatz opened the door and came out, his mouth ajar, his face flushed slightly, his eyes leaking isolated and unpunctual tears. He had reached an age where death no longer has the quality of ghastly surprise, and when he looked around him now for the first time and saw the height and splendour of the hall and the great rooms opening out from it into other rooms, his grief began to be mixed with an awed pride.I helped him to a bedroom upstairs；while he took off his coat and vest I told him that all arrangements had been deferred until he came.

‘I didn't know what you'd want, M r Gatsby-'

‘Gatz is my name.'

4-M r Gatz. I thought you might want to take the body West.'

He shook his head.

‘Jimmy always liked it better down East. He rose up to his position in the East.Were you a friend of my boy's, Mr-?'

‘We were close friends.'

‘He had a big future before him, you know. He was only a young man, but he had a lot of brain power here.'

He touched his head impressively, and I nodded.

‘If he'd of lived, he'd of been a great man. A man like James J.Hill.He'd of helped build up the country.'

‘That's true，'I said, uncomfortably.

He fumbled at the embroidered coverlet, trying to take it from the bed, and lay down stiffly-and was instantly asleep.

That night an obviously frightened person called up, and demanded to know who I was before he would give his name.

‘This is M r Carraway，'I said.

‘Oh！'He sounded relieved.‘This is Klipspringer.'

I was relieved too, for that seemed to promise another friend at Gatsby's grave. I didn't want it to be in the papers and draw a sightseeing crowd, so I'd been calling up a few people myself.They were hard to find.

‘The funeral's tomorrow，'I said.‘Three o'clock, here at the house. I wish you'd tell anybody who'd be interested.’

‘Oh, I will，'he broke out hastily.‘O f course I'm not likely to see anybody, but if I do.'

His tone made me suspicious.

‘O f course you'll be there yourself.'

‘Well, I'll certainly try. What I called up about is-'

‘Wait a minute，'I interrupted.‘How about saying you'll come?'

‘Well, the fact is-the truth of the matter is that I'm staying with some people up here in Greenwich, and they rather expect me to be with them tomorrow. In fact, there's a sort of picnic or something.Of course I'll do my very best to get away.'

I ejaculated an unrestrained‘Huh'and he must have heard me, for he went on nervously：

‘What I called up about was a pair of shoes I left there. I wonder if it'd be too much trouble to have the buder send them on.You see, they're tennis shoes, and I'm sort of helpless without them.M y address is care of B.F.-'

I didn't hear the rest of the name, because I hung up the receiver.

After that I felt a certain shame for Gatsby-one gendeman to whom I telephoned implied that he had got what he deserved. However, that was my fault, for he was one of those who used to sneer most bitterly at Gatsby on the courage of Gatsby's liquor, and I should have known better than to call him.

The morning of the funeral I went up to New York to see Meyer Wolfsheim；I couldn't seem to reach him any other way. The door that I pushed open, on the advice of an elevator boy, was marked‘The Swastika Holding Company，'and at first there didn't seem to be anyone inside.But when I'd shouted‘hello'several times in vain, an argument broke out behind a partition, and presently a lovely Jewess appeared at an interior door and scrutinised me with black hostile eyes.

‘Nobody's in，'she said.‘Mr Wolfsheim's gone to Chicago.'

The first part of this was obviously untrue, for someone had begun to whistle‘The Rosary'，tunelessly, inside.

‘Please say that Mr Carraway wants to see him.'

‘I can't get him back from Chicago, can I?'

At this moment a voice, unmistakably Wolfsheim's, called‘Stella！'from the other side of the door.

‘Leave your name on the desk，'she said quickly.‘I'll give it to him when he gets back.'

‘But I know he's there.'

She took a step towards me and began to slide her hands indignantly up and down her hips.

‘You young men think you can force your way in here any time，'she scolded.‘W e're getting sickantired of it. When I say he's in Chicago, he's in Chicazgo.'

I mentioned Gatsby.

‘Oh-h！'She looked at me over again.‘Will you just-What was your name?'

She vanished. In a moment Meyer Wolfsheim stood solemnly in the doorway, holding out both hands.He drew me into his office, remarking in a reverent voice that it was a sad time for all of us, and offered me a cigar.

‘M y memory goes back to when first I met him，'he said.‘A young major just out of the army and covered over with medals he got in the war. He was so hard up he had to keep on wearing his uniform because he couldn't buy some regular clothes.First time I saw him was when he come into Winebrenner's poolroom at Forty-third Street and asked for a job.He hadn't eat anything for a couple of days.“Come on have some lunch with me，”I said.He ate more than four dollars'worth of food in half an hour.’

‘Did you start him in business?'I enquired.

‘Start him！I made him.'

‘Oh.'

‘I raised him up out of nothing, right out of the gutter. I saw right away he was a fine-appearing, gendemanly young man, and when he told me he was an Oggsford I knew I could use him good.I got him to join up in the American Legion and he used to stand high there.Right off he did some work for a client of mine up to Albany.We were so thick like that in everything'-he held up two bulbous fingers-‘always together.'

I wondered if this partnership had included the World's Series transaction in 1919.

‘Now he's dead，'I said after a moment.‘You were his closest friend, so I know you'll want to come to his funeral this afternoon.'

‘I'd like to come.'

‘Well, come then.'

The hair in his nostrils quivered slightly, and as he shook his head his eyes filled with tears.

‘I can't do it-1 can't get mixed up in it，'he said.

‘There's nothing to get mixed up in. It's all over now.'

‘When a man gets killed I never like to get mixed up in it in any way. I keep out.When I was a young man it was different-if a friend of mine died, no matter how, I stuck with them to the end.You may think that's sentimental, but I mean it-to the bitter end.'

I saw that for some reason of his own he was determined not to come, so I stood up.

‘Are you a college man?'he enquired suddenly.

For a moment I thought he was going to suggest a‘gonnegtion'，but he only nodded and shook my hand.

‘Let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and not after he is dead，'he suggested.‘After that, my own rule is to let everything alone.'

When I left his office the sky had turned dark and I got back to West Egg in a drizzle. After changing my clothes I went next door and found M r Gatz walking up and down excitedly in the hall.His pride in his son and in his son's possessions was continually increasing and now he had something to show me.

‘Jimmy sent me this picture.'He took out his wallet with trembling fingers.‘Look there.'

It was a photograph of the house, cracked in the comers and dirty with many hands. He pointed out every detail to me eagerly.‘Look there！'and then sought admiration from my eyes.He had shown it so often that I think it was more real to him now than the house itself.

‘Jimmy sent it to me. I think it's a very pretty picture.It shows up well.'‘Very well.Had you seen him lately?'

‘He came out to see me two years ago and bought me the house I live in now. Of course we was broke up when he run off from home, but I see now there was a reason for it.He knew he had a big future in front of him.And ever since he made a success he was very generous with me.'

He seemed reluctant to put away the picture, held it for another minute, lingeringly, before my eyes. Then he returned the wallet and pulled from his pocket a ragged old copy book called Hopalong Cassidy.

‘Look here, this is a book he had when he was a boy. It just shows you.'

He opened it at the back cover and turned it around for me to see. On the last fly-leaf was printed the word Schedule, and the date September 12，1906.And underneath：

‘I come across this book by accident，'said the old man.‘It just shows you, don't it?

‘Jimmy was bound to get ahead. He always had some resolves like this or something.Do you notice what he's got about improving his mind?He was always great for that.He told me I et like a hog once, and I beat him for it.'

He was reluctant to close the book, reading each item aloud and then looking eagerly at me. I think he rather expected me to copy down the list for my own use.

A little before three the Lutheran minister arrived from Flushing, and I began to look involuntarily out the windows for other cars. So did Gatsby's father.And as the time passed and the servants came in and stood waiting in the hall, his eyes began to blink anxiously, and he spoke of the rain in a worried, uncertain way.The minister glanced several times at his watch, so I took him aside and asked him to wait for half an hour.But it wasn't any use.Nobody came.

About five o'clock our procession of three cars reached the cemetery and stopped in a thick drizzle beside the gate-first a motor hearse, horribly black and wet, then M r Gatz and the minister and I in the limousine, and a little later four or five servants and the postman from West Egg, in Gatsby's station-wagon, all wet to the skin. As we started through the gate into the cemetery I heard a car stop and then the sound of someone splashing after us over the soggy ground.I looked around.It was the man with owl-eyed glasses whom I had found marvelling over Gatsby's books in the library one night three months before.

I'd never seen him since then. I don't know how he knew about the funeral, or even his name.The rain poured down his thick glasses, and he took them of and wiped them to see the protecting canvas unrolled from Gatsby's grave.

I tried to think about Gatsby then for a moment, but he was already too far away, and I could only remember, without resentment, that Daisy hadn't sent a message or a flower. Dimly I heard someone murmur，‘Blessed are the dead that the rain falls on，'and then the owl­eyed man said，‘Amen to that，'in a brave voice.

We straggled down quickly through the rain to the cars. Owl-eyes spoke to me by the gate.

‘I couldn't get to the house，'he remarked.

‘Neither could anybody else.'

‘Go on！'He started.‘Why, my God！they used to go there by the hundreds.'

He took off his glasses and wiped them again, outside and in.

‘The poor son-of-a-bitch，'he said.

One of my most vivid memories is of coming back West from prep school and later from college at Christmastime. Those who went farther than Chicago would gather in the old dim Union Station at six o'clock of a December evening, with a few Chicago friends, already caught up into their own holiday gaieties, to bid them a hasty goodbye.I remember the fur coats of the girls returning from Miss This-or-That's and the chatter of frozen breath and the hands waving overhead as we caught sight of old acquaintances, and the matchings of invitations：‘Are you going to the Ordways'?the Herseys'?the Schultzes'?’and the long green tickets clasped tight in our gloved hands.And last the murky yellow cars of the Chicago, Milwaukee&St Paul Railroad looking cheerful as Christmas itself on the tracks beside the gate.

When we pulled out into the winter night and the real snow, our snow, began to stretch out beside us and twinkle against the windows, and the dim lights of small Wisconsin stations moved by, a sharp wild brace came suddenly into the air. We drew in deep breaths of it as we walked back from dinner through the cold vestibules, unutterably aware of our identity with this country for one strange hour, before we melted indistinguishably into it again.

That's my Middle West-not the wheat or the prairies or the lost Swede towns, but the thrilling returning trains of my youth, and the street lamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly wreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow. I am part of that, a little solemn with the feel of those long winters, a little complacent from growing up in the Carraway house in a city where dwellings are still called through decades by a family's name.I see now that this has been a story of the West, after all-Tom and Gatsby, Daisy andJordan and I were all Westerners, and perhaps we possessed some deficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life.

Even when the East excited me most, even when I was most keenly aware of its superiority to the bored, sprawling, swollen towns beyond the Ohio, with their interminable inquisitions which spared only the children and the very old-even then it had always for me a quality of distortion. West Egg, especially, still figures in my more fantastic dreams.I see it as a night scene by El Greco：a hundred houses, at once conventional and grotesque, crouching under a sullen, overhang­ing sky and a lustreless moon.In the foreground four solemn men in dress suits are walking long the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies a drunken woman in a white evening dress.Her hand, which dangles over the side, sparkles cold with jewels.Gravely the men turn in at a house-the wrong house.But no one knows the woman's name, and no one cares.

After Gatsby's death the East was haunted for me like that, distorted beyond my eyes'power of correction. So when the blue smoke of brittle leaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the line I decided to come back home.

There was one thing to be done before I left, an awkward, unpleasant thing that perhaps had better have been let alone. But I wanted to leave things in order and not just trust that obliging and indifferent sea to sweep my refuse away.I saw Jordan Baker and talked over and around what had happened to us together, and what had happened afterward to me, and she lay perfectly still, listening, in a big chair.

She was dressed to play golf, and I remember thinking she looked like a good illustration, her chin raised a little jauntily, her hair the colour of an autumn leaf, her face the same brown tint as the fingerless glove on her knee. When I had finished she told me without comment that she was engaged to another man.I doubted that, though there were several she could have married at a nod of her head, but I pretended to be surprised.For just a minute I wondered if I wasn't making a mistake, then I thought it all over again quickly and got up to say goodbye.

‘Nevertheless you did throw me over，'said Jordan suddenly.‘You threw me over on the telephone. I don't give a damn about you now, but it was a new experience for me, and I felt a little dizzy for a while.'

We shook hands.

‘Oh, and do you remember'-she added-‘a conversation we had once about driving a car?'

‘Why-not exactly.'

‘You said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver?Well, I met another bad driver, didn't I?I mean it was careless of me to make such a wrong guess. I thought you were rather an honest, straightforward person.I thought it was your secret pride.'

‘I'm thirty，'I said.‘I'm five years too old to lie to myself and call it honour.'

She didn't answer. Angry, and half in love with her, and tremen­dously sorry, I turned away.

One afternoon late in October I saw Tom Buchanan. He was walking ahead of me along Fifth Avenue in his alert, aggressive way, his hands out a little from his body as if to fight off interference, his head moving sharply here and there, adapting itself to his restless eyes.Just as I slowed up to avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning into the windows of a jewellery store.Suddenly he saw me and walked back, holding out his hand.

‘What's the matter, Nick?Do you object to shaking hands with me?'‘Yes. You know what I think of you.'

‘You're crazy, Nick，'he said quickly.‘Crazy as hell. I don't know what's the matter with you.'

‘Tom，'I enquired，‘what did you say to Wilson that afternoon?'

He stared at me without a word, and I knew I had guessed right about those missing hours. I started to turn away, but he took a step after me and grabbed my arm.

‘I told him the truth，'he said.‘He came to the door while we were getting ready to leave, and when I sent down word that we weren't in he tried to force his way upstairs. He was crazy enough to kill me if I hadn't told him who owned the car.His hand was on a revolver in his pocket every minute he was in the house-'He broke off defiantly.‘What if I did tell him?That fellow had it coming to him.He threw dust into your eyes just like he did in Daisy's, but he was a tough one.He ran over Myrtle like you’d run over a dog and never even stopped his car.’

There was nothing I could say, except the one unutterable fact that it wasn't true.

‘And if you think I didn't have my share of suffering-look here, when I went to give up that flat and saw that damn box of dog biscuits sitting there on the sideboard, I sat down and cried like a baby. By God, it was awful-'

I couldn't forgive him or like him, but I saw that what he had done was, to him, entirely justified. It was all very careless and confused.They were careless people, Tom and Daisy-they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made……

I shook hands with him；it seemed silly not to for I felt suddenly as though I were talking to a child. Then he went into the jewellery store to buy a pearl necklace-or perhaps only a pair of cuff buttons-rid of my provincial squeamishness forever.

Gatsby's house was still empty when I left-the grass on his lawn had grown as long as mine. One of the taxi drivers in the village never took a fare past the entrance gate without stopping for a minute and pointing inside；perhaps it was he who drove Daisy and Gatsby over to East Egg the night of the accident, and perhaps he had made a story about it all his own.I didn't want to hear it and I avoided him when I got off the train.

I spent my Saturday nights in New York, because those gleaming, dazzling parties of his were with me so vividly that I could still hear the music and the laughter, faint and incessant, from his garden, and the cars going up and down his drive. One night I did hear a material car there, and saw its lights stop at his front steps.But I didn't investigate.Probably it was some final guest who had been away at the ends of the earth and didn't know that the party was over.

On the last night, with my trunk packed and my car sold to the grocer, I went over and looked at that huge incoherent failure of a house once more. On the white steps an obscene word, scrawled by some boy with a piece of brick, stood out clearly in the moonlight, and I erased it, drawing my shoe raspingly along the stone.Then I wandered down to the beach and sprawled out on the sand.

Most of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any lights except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across the Sound. And as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that flowered once for Dutch sailors'eyes-a fresh, green breast of the new world.Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby's house, had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams；for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder.

And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of Gatsby's wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy's dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it.He did not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night.

Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter-tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther……And one fine morning-

So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.
