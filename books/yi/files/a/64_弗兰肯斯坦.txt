弗兰肯斯坦


译序


英国女作家玛丽·雪莱（Mary Shelley，1797—1851）是19世纪欧洲杰出的浪漫主义诗人珀西·雪莱的妻子。她的父亲威廉·哥德文（William Godwin，1756—1836）是享有盛名的思想家，母亲玛丽·沃尔斯顿克拉弗特（Mary Wollstonecraft，1759—1797）是著名的女权运动领袖。雪莱因思想激进而被牛津大学开除之后，追随哥德文并常到其家中请教，与玛丽相爱。两人冲破了重重阻碍而结合，从1816年起流亡国外。1822年雪莱在意大利溺水而亡后，玛丽返回英国，从事雪莱诗作的整理出版工作，并创作了几部长篇小说和大量短篇小说。

《弗兰肯斯坦》全名为《弗兰肯斯坦，或现代普罗米修斯》（Frankenstein，or the Modern Prometheus），1816年写于瑞士。玛丽·雪莱创作这部小说的起因本身就是一个有趣的故事：雪莱和玛丽在瑞士与当时也流亡在此的另一位英国浪漫主义诗人拜伦比邻而居，朝夕相处。在阴雨天的傍晚，他们围炉而坐，偶然读到几本德国的鬼怪故事，不禁兴味盎然，约定每人写一部有关超自然事件的小说。玛丽冥思苦想而难以下笔，一天夜里，她做了一个神秘而恐怖的梦，觉得豁然开朗，便以其为基础逐步发展成为现在的这部小说。拜伦和雪莱虽然因去阿尔卑斯山旅行而未能履约，但拜伦将他写出的开头部分用在了其他作品里，雪莱则不仅给玛丽以热情鼓励，本书的序言实际上也是他的手笔。

单纯从这则文坛逸事看，本书的产生似乎只是一个偶然现象，但实际上是有着非常深刻的原因的。18世纪末到19世纪初，欧洲流行着所谓的“哥特式小说”，常常描写离奇、神秘和恐怖的事件，一时蔚成风气。《弗兰肯斯坦》显然受到了它的影响。从更深广的方面来看，当时正值资本主义发展以及随之而来的生产力和科学技术突飞猛进的时期，许多思想家和文学家觉察到在社会的一时表面繁荣之下掩盖着深刻危机，开始对18世纪的启蒙理性主义产生怀疑，试图从人性、伦理、情感等角度进行批判性的反思。哥特式小说和当时的感伤主义文学都是这一思潮的产物，波澜壮阔的19世纪浪漫主义文学也是以此为思想基础的。因此，本书就其风格而言，可以说是一部哥特式小说，从它以创造生命的科学实验为情节来看，可以说是一部科学幻想小说（事实上它也被公认为西方文学史上的第一部科幻小说，被誉为科幻文学的开山之作），但其主题的重大、思想内蕴的丰富、对人性剖析的深刻、心理分析和景物描写的出色，却远非一般的哥特式小说或科幻小说所能比拟。

小说的主人公弗兰肯斯坦怀着探索生命奥秘、造福人类的良好愿望创造了一个“人”。正因为如此，作者引用古希腊神话中普罗米修斯创造人类、为人类盗取天火并教给人类各种技艺的典故，为小说加了一个副标题“现代普罗米修斯”。普罗米修斯受到了大神宙斯的惩罚，而弗兰肯斯坦则受到他自己行为的报复。他所创造的“人”不仅给他自身带来了可怕的灾难，而且使人类面临着巨大的危险，弗兰肯斯坦尤其对后一点忧虑不安，才必欲毁灭自己的创造物而后已。在作者看来，科学技术的发展并不必然地给人类带来福祉，假如我们对客观规律缺乏正确而深入的认识，无视人类与自然界的和谐关系，不同时致力于社会组织结构的改善和人类自身素质的提高，弗兰肯斯坦式的悲剧有可能变成现实。两个世纪过去了，科学技术已取得了玛丽·雪莱所未能预料的巨大进展，但20世纪生态环境的恶化、运用高科技手段的大规模战争、核泄漏、电脑病毒乃至近来引起普遍关注的生物“克隆”技术等等，都有力地证明了本书提出的问题是多么具有预见性。

弗兰肯斯坦创造的“怪物”便体现了科学技术的这一异化力量，但是作者并未以漫画式的手法将他处理成单纯的“恶”的象征。他虽然形体丑陋，面目狰狞，却具有正常的知觉和丰富的感情，渴望友谊、爱情和幸福，希望得到人类的理解和接纳；他为此做过种种努力，但总是受到拒斥、唾弃和伤害，内心充满孤独和痛苦；随着他对人类的所作所为有所了解，他发现人间处处是贫穷、压迫、欺诈和杀戮，不禁深感失望；他最后希望能有一个异性同类作为伴侣，到远离人类的地方去过隐遁生活，又遭到弗兰肯斯坦的拒绝。因此，“善”才转变为“恶”，他才对弗兰肯斯坦实施复仇，并对整个人类充满了憎恶和仇恨。用他自己的话来说，就是“堕落的天使变成了狠毒的魔鬼”。和弗兰肯斯坦一样，他也是一个悲剧性的形象，在小说结尾的时候，他自愿前往北极冰海焚身自杀，便是最后对人类提出的悲愤抗议。这一悲剧提醒人类自省自惕，从社会制度和伦理价值角度进行自我审视，从而大大地深化了小说的主题。

小说从这个角度出发，对弗兰肯斯坦和“怪物”的性格进行了集中刻画，成功地运用了心理描写、情感抒发和对话等手法，表现出了形象塑造的高超艺术技巧。小说的景物描写也十分出色，尤其是日内瓦湖的绮丽风光和阿尔卑斯山的宏伟景色，不仅如诗如画，而且情景交融，令人叹为观止。在叙述方式上，小说采用了大故事套小故事的框架式结构，第一层次是探险家沃尔顿在给姐姐的信中讲述遇见弗兰肯斯坦的事，第二层次是弗兰肯斯坦向沃尔顿叙述自己的遭遇，第三层次是“怪物”对弗兰肯斯坦讲他的经历，最后，在第三层次中又包含着费利克斯一家的故事等等。这种结构方式显得别致精巧，如层层剥笋，步步深入。我们从小说中不仅能得到深刻的思想启迪，也能获得充分的艺术享受。

序言


这部小说所根据的事件，按照达尔文博士和德国某些生理学家提出的假设，并非是不可能发生的。对于这样一种想象的产物，我丝毫也没有认为实有其事，可是，在以之作为一部幻想作品的基础时，我也并不认为自己仅仅是在编织一连串的超自然恐怖事件而已。故事引人入胜，在于其情节摆脱了纯粹的鬼怪魔法故事的种种弊端。它由于自身展示的场景的新奇而受到欢迎，而且，无论作为物质事实是多么的不可能，它却为想象力提供了一个新的视点，以便比实际事件的普通关系更广泛地、更强有力地描绘出人类的激情。

我就这样努力地保存人类天性种种基本要素的真实性，同时又毫无顾忌地在这些要素的组合上进行创新。希腊的悲剧史诗《伊利亚特》，莎士比亚的《暴风雨》和《仲夏夜之梦》，特别是弥尔顿的《失乐园》，都符合这一法则。一个最谦卑的小说家，试图通过他的劳动使别人或者使自己得到娱乐，可以并非冒昧地在散文作品中运用诗的“破格”，或者说运用一种法则，在成就最高的诗歌中，因为应用这种法则而描绘出了如此众多的人类情感的精妙组合。

我的故事所依据的情景源于随意闲谈的启发。写作的初衷，部分是为了有所消遣，部分是以此作为未经考验的智力的一种锻炼手段。在写作过程中又掺进了其他一些动机。无论小说中所包含的情感或人物体现出怎样的道德倾向，对于它影响读者的方式，我当然是绝不会漠然视之的。不过，我在这方面主要的关注点，一直局限于避免现今小说削弱道德意义的效果，并专注于展示家庭感情的温馨亲切和普遍美德的崇高卓越。从主人公的性格和处境之中自然流露出来的观点，绝不应被视为是我本人的一贯信念；也不能理所当然地从后面的篇章中推论说，我对任何派别的任何学说怀有偏见。

对于作者而言，这部小说还有一个富于特殊兴味之处，那就是故事的创作开始于一个风景宏伟的地区，这也是书中主要场景之所在，同时它又是在与我永远怀念的人们的相互交往中动笔的。我是在日内瓦郊外度过1816年的夏季的。那个季节寒冷多雨，傍晚时分我们总是聚在熊熊燃烧的炉火边，偶尔读读碰巧落在手里的一些德国鬼怪故事来作消遣。这些故事激起了我们加以戏谑性模仿的欲望。两位朋友（任何一位写的故事都会远比我希望自己所能写出的更受大众的欢迎）和我本人一致约定，每个人都要根据某种超自然事件写出一个故事来。

然而天气突然转晴了，两位朋友撇下我到阿尔卑斯山去旅行，置身于壮丽风景中，浑然忘却了他们关于鬼怪的幻想。下面的故事便成了唯一完成了的作品。



1817年9月，马洛





第一封信

致萨维尔夫人


你将高兴地听到，你怀着那样凶险的预兆来看待的一项事业，在开始的时候并未发生任何灾难。我在昨天到达这里，我的第一个任务是要让我亲爱的姐姐确信我安康，并对我事业的成功增进信心。

我现在已经置身于远离伦敦的遥远的北方了。当我行走在圣彼得堡街头的时候，我感觉到寒冷的北风拂弄着我的面颊，它使我精神振奋、充满喜悦。你理解这种感情吗？这风是从我即将前往的那些地方吹来的，它让我事先品尝一下冰天雪地的滋味。在这蕴含成功希望的北风的鼓舞下，我的白日梦变得愈加炽热而生动了。我即使试图让自己相信北极乃是天寒地冻的荒凉之地，也是徒劳，它在我的想象之中总是充满美丽和欢乐的地方。在那里，玛格丽特，太阳永远不会沉落，它那个大圆盘只是紧贴地平线，放射着永恒的光辉。在那里——我的姐姐，请允许我对以前的航海家们给予几分信任——在那里并没有冰雪风霜。我们在平静的海面航行，也许会漂到一块陆地上，其奇异美丽要超过我们居住的地球上迄今已发现的任何地方。它的物产和风貌可能是无与伦比的，正像那些未经发现的孤独天体上的情景无疑是无与伦比的一样。在一个充满永恒光辉的国度，还有什么你以为是见不到的呢？我会在那里发现吸引磁针的神奇的力量，还会校正成千次天体观察的结果，只需有这次航行便可以将其中那些看来古怪的现象永远变得合情合理了。我强烈的好奇心，将因为看到人类从未造访过的这个世界的一部分而得到满足，我也许会踏上一块从来不曾印上人类足迹的土地。就是这一切使我心醉神迷，它们足以让我克服一切关于危险和死亡的恐惧，并引诱我欢欣鼓舞地开始这一次艰难竭蹶的航程，就像一个孩子登上了一条小舟，和度假的小伙伴们一道，沿着家乡的河流溯源探险一样。即便是我这一切推测猜想都纯属子虚乌有吧，你也无法否认，我将在北极附近探索出一条通往某些国家的新航线，而现在要到达那里必须花费好几个月时间。我将弄清磁力的奥秘，假如这个奥秘可能弄清的话，也只有通过我这样的事业才能实现，这样，我将为整个人类直至子孙万代带来不可估量的益处。

这些思考已经驱散了我开始写信时的那种热切不安的情绪，我感到内心燃起了一种使我崇高激越的热情，因为要使头脑镇静清醒莫过于心中怀有一个坚定不移的目标——在这一点上，灵魂可以使它的心智之眼专注如一。这次探险是我早年梦寐以求的事情。我曾经满腔热情地阅读过许多航海故事，它们记载着期盼穿越环绕北极的海洋而抵达北太平洋的种种航行。你也许还记得，我们的好托马斯叔叔的全部藏书就是一部记载所有航海探险的历史。我对受教育是漫不经心的，但我却十分热衷于读书。这几卷书就是我夜以继日所做的功课，而我把它们读得烂熟，就越发增强了我的遗憾，在我还小的时候，知道了父亲的遗训是禁止叔叔允许我从事航海生涯，这种遗憾就产生了。

当我第一次读到那些诗人的作品时，他们奔放的情感使我心醉神迷、如登天庭，原来那些幻想便黯然消退了。我也成了一个诗人，在我自己创造的天国里生活了一年，我想象自己或许也能在供奉着荷马和莎士比亚大名的圣殿里占据一席之地。你很清楚我是失败了，而且失望又让我心情多么沉痛。但就是在那个时候，我继承了堂兄的财产，我的心思又转回到早年癖好的轨道上来了。

自从我下定决心要进行目前这次航行以来，已有六个年头过去了。即使是现在，我还能记起自己刚刚决心献身于这项伟大事业的那个时刻。一开始我训练自己的身体以适应艰苦处境。我跟随捕鲸者数次远航到北海，我自愿忍受严寒、饥饿、干渴和睡眠不足，在白天我干活常常比一般水手还要苦，到了晚上又专心致志地学习数学、医药理论，以及航海冒险家可以从中获得最大实效的那些自然科学学科。有两次我真的在一艘格陵兰捕鲸船上被雇用做了二副，而且因恪尽职守得到赞扬。当船长邀我做船上仅次于他的大副，并以最大的热忱请求我留下的时候，我得承认，我是感到有点儿自豪了；船长认为我的工作干得是那样的卓有成效。

现在，亲爱的玛格丽特，难道我不配去实现某个伟大的目标吗？我的一生本可以在舒适奢华中度过，但我更愿意获取荣誉，而无视财富在我人生道路上设置的种种诱惑。啊，我多么希望有鼓励的话语来支持我的选择！我的勇气和决心是坚定不移的，不过我的希望时明时暗，我的情绪也常常低落下去。我即将出发开始一次漫长而艰难的航程，种种突发事件需要我百折不挠：这要求我不但要鼓舞别人的斗志，有时还要在别人情绪消沉的时候支撑起自己的精神。

眼下是在俄罗斯旅行的最佳时期。人们驾着雪橇在雪上飞驰；这样的滑行真惬意，在我看来，它远比坐在英国的公共马车里行进更令人愉快。如果你身上裹着裘皮衣服，也不会觉得太冷的——我现在已经穿上这样的服装了，因为在甲板上走动着，和动也不动地一坐几个钟头是大有区别的，这样坐着身体没有任何活动，难保血液不会真的在血管里凝结起来呢。我可没有在圣彼得堡与阿尔汉格尔斯克(1)之间的驿道上丢掉性命的打算。

我将在两三个星期之后动身去阿尔汉格尔斯克；我打算在那儿租上一艘船，只要为船主付保险金，这事是很容易办到的，再在惯于捕鲸的人当中招募够必要的船员。我准备一直等到6月再启航。至于什么时候回来呢？啊，亲爱的姐姐，我怎么能够回答这个问题呢？假如我成功了，那我们将会过很多、很多月，或许很多、很多年之后才能相见。假如我失败了，你就会很快再见到我的，或者永远也见不到我了。

再见了，我亲爱的、顶好的玛格丽特。愿上天赐福给你，也保佑我，这样我就可以一次又一次地证明我感激你对我的爱和关心了。

你亲爱的弟弟 罗·沃尔顿

17××年12月11日，圣彼得堡

第二封信

致萨维尔夫人


被包围在这儿的冰天雪地里，时间过得是多么缓慢啊！不过，我已经朝着我的事业迈开第二步了。我租到了一艘船，正忙着招募船员。现在已经招募到的看来都是些靠得住的人，肯定都具有无所畏惧的勇气。

不过我还有一个需要至今没有得到满足，我现在感到最严重的不幸便是缺乏了这个东西。我没有一个朋友，玛格丽特：当我因成功的热情而兴高采烈的时候，没有谁和我共享欢乐；如果失望来袭击我，也没有谁在沮丧中尽力给我支持。是的，我可以在纸上倾诉我的思绪，但这对于传达情感而言只是一个聊胜于无的办法。我希望有一个与我情投意合的伙伴，他的眼睛和我的眼睛可以做无言的交流。你也许会认为我太多情和好幻想，亲爱的姐姐，但我确实痛感需要一个朋友。我身边没有这样一个人，他既温和又勇敢，既富于教养又胸怀博大，志趣和我一致，可以赞同或者修正我的计划。有了这样的一个朋友，将会给你可怜的弟弟的缺点带来怎样的补益啊！我办起事来过于热切，遇到困难又太缺乏耐心。但对我来说更大的不幸是我的教育全靠自修：我一生中的最初十四年里都在野地里游荡胡闹，除了托马斯叔叔的航海书籍以外什么也没读过。那些年头过后我知道了我国的那些著名的诗人，可是也只是在我确信自己无力从中获取最重要的教益时，我才意识到有必要了解一些我国语言之外的更多的语言。我现在已经二十八岁了，而事实上我在学识上还不如许多十五岁的中学生。我确实想得比较多，我的白日梦也愈加海阔天空、壮丽辉煌，可是它们缺乏的是（就像画家们所说的）——“协调”。我迫切需要有一个朋友，他要有足够的见识，不至于觉得我耽于幻想而鄙薄我，还要对我有足够的感情，会尽力校正我的思想。

好了，这些都是于事无补的抱怨。在茫茫大海上我当然是找不到什么朋友的，即使在阿尔汉格尔斯克这儿，在商人和水手中间，也是不会找到什么朋友的。不过，甚至在这些粗犷的心胸里，也仍然搏动着某些并未与人性的渣滓同流合污的情感。比如我的副手，就是一个具有出色的勇气和事业心的人。他狂热地渴求荣誉，或者用更为确切的话来说，是一个渴盼在职业上大展宏图的人。他是一个英国人，怀有民族的和职业的偏见，缺乏教养上的陶冶，但仍然保持着人性中某些最高尚的禀赋。我最初是在一艘捕鲸船上认识他的：我发现他在这个城市里还没有工作，没费什么周折就雇了他来协助我的事业。

船长是一个性情极好的人，他在船上素以态度温和、纪律宽大著称。这一事实，再加上他那众所周知的正直品德和无畏勇气，使得我非常希望能雇用他。我的青年时代在孤独中流逝，我一生中最好的岁月是在温柔的、女性的抚育下度过的，这使得我的性格的根基变得如此温柔文雅，以致我对船上司空见惯的残暴行为怀有不可抑制的厌恶心理：我从不相信这种行为是必要的。所以当我听说有一个著名的海员，他既心地善良，又能得到水手们的尊敬和服从的时候，便因为能够请他为我工作而感到特别幸运。我是在一种颇富浪漫色彩的情况下，从一个受过他的救命之恩的女士口中第一次听说他的。下面就是关于他的简短的故事。若干年前，他爱上了一个家境小康的俄国女子。他已经攒下了一笔数额可观的奖金，姑娘的父亲同意了他们的婚事。在约定的婚礼之前，他有一次去看她，而她却泪如涌泉，扑跪在他的脚下请求他的宽恕，同时坦陈自己爱着另一个男人，可是因为他穷，父亲绝不会同意他们结合。我的慷慨大度的朋友要这位恳求者放心；当他获悉她的心上人的姓名之后便立即放弃了自己的婚事。他已经用自己那笔钱购置了一处农场，计划在那里度过余生，可是他却把整个农场赠送给了他的情敌，还用奖金的剩余部分添置了牲口，然后亲自去请求姑娘的父亲同意她和她的情人结为夫妻。老人却坚决予以拒绝，认为自己在道义上对我的朋友负有责任。当我的朋友发现老人的想法无可动摇的时候，便离开了祖国，直到他听见他过去的未婚妻如愿以偿地结了婚以后才回国。你会惊叹说：“一个多么高尚的人啊！”他的确是这样的一个人，不过他完全没有受过什么教育：他就像个土耳其人一样沉默寡言，还有某种愚昧无知、大大咧咧的神气，这固然使他的行为显得更加令人惊讶，但也减弱了他本来应该博得的兴趣和同情。

不过不要因为我稍稍抱怨了一下，或者我对闻所未闻的艰难劳作进行了一点自我安慰，就以为我的决心发生了动摇。我的决心和命运一样的坚定不移，我的航行眼下只是暂时推延，只待天气允许便会启程。今年冬天一直是可怕的严寒，但春天可以期望会很好，而且大家认为会来得特别早，因此我启航的时间也许比预期的要来得快。我不会鲁莽从事的，你是了解我的，相信一旦有他人的安全托付给我照料的时候，我会做到慎重小心、考虑周到的。

我无法向你形容我展望即将开始的事业前景时是怎样的感觉。我在做出发前的准备时，那种半是欣喜半是疑惧的战栗不安的心情，是无法用语言传达给你的。我即将前往那个“迷雾冰雪之地”的未经探索过的地区，不过我是绝不会杀死信天翁的，所以你也不要为我的安全担惊受怕，难道我会像那个“老水手”一样形容枯槁、满怀忧伤地回来见你吗？你一定会笑我引用了这个故事(1)，不过我要向你披露一个秘密。我常常把自己对于海洋那种危险和神秘的眷恋，以及对它的炽烈的热情，归因于当代最富想象力的诗人的那部作品。在我的灵魂中有某种我不能理解的东西在起作用。我干起事来很勤奋——很刻苦——我是一个坚韧不拔、埋头苦干的工匠。可是除此之外我又热爱奇妙的东西，相信奇妙的事情，它们掺和进我的一切计划之中，这便驱使我越出人们所走的常规之路，甚至走向了我即将去探索的那片茫茫大海和人类未曾涉足之地。

不过还是回到更为亲切的关怀之情上来吧。在我穿越广袤的海洋，绕过非洲或美洲最南端的海岬之后，还会再见到你吗？我真不敢期望这样的成功，然而我又不忍看到与此相反的情景。在目前请利用每一个机会继续给我写信，在将来我最需要你的信来支撑起自己的精神的时候，我可以再来读它们。我深深地爱你。万一你再也得不到我的消息，就亲切地怀念我吧。

第三封信

致萨维尔夫人


我亲爱的姐姐——我在匆忙中写下几行字，为的是向你报告我平安，并在航程上行进得很好。这封信是托一个从阿尔汉格尔斯克坐船回英国的商人带回来的。他比我幸运，而我或许会有许多年见不到自己的祖国。不过我情绪很饱满，我的水手们都很勇敢，显得意志坚定。漂浮的冰块不断地经过我们身边，表明我们所前进的区域充满危险，似乎也并不使他们惊慌。我们已经到达了纬度很高的地区，不过现在正值盛夏，尽管没有英国那样暖和，但南来的大风刮着我们迅疾地驶向我渴盼到达的海岸，却也带来了某种我未曾料想到的振奋精神的暖意。

到目前为止还没有发生过任何事情值得在信中大书特书。一两次猛烈的大风，一处船漏涌进了水，对于饱有经验的航海者来说只是些无心去记录的偶发事件而已。只要在我们的航程中不发生更糟糕的事，我就心满意足了。

再见了，我亲爱的玛格丽特。请你放心，为了我，也为了你，我是不会莽撞地冒险的，我会冷静、坚韧而谨慎。

不过我的努力一定会圆满成功的。为什么不呢？我在没有航道的大海上平安地航行，已经走了这么远，星星就是我胜利的证人和见证。为什么我不能在这未经驯服却又俯首听命的大海上继续前进呢？有什么能阻挡人的决心和坚定的意志呢？

我激动的心情竟这样不能自已地倾泻而出。不过我必须搁笔了。愿上天保佑我亲爱的姐姐！

罗·沃

17××年7月7日





第四封信

致萨维尔夫人


我们遇到了如此奇怪的一件事，我没法制止自己把它记下来，尽管在这封信到你手中之前，很可能你已经见到我了。

上个星期一（7月31日），我们差不多被冰块包围了，船的四周全挤着冰，几乎没留一点船只可以通过的余地。我们的处境有些危急，特别是又有浓密的大雾包裹着我们的时候。我们因此只好顶风停船，希望气层和天气会发生变化。

大约两点钟时分，雾散了，我们看见四面八方都延伸着宽阔而不规则的冰原，仿佛没有尽头似的。我的一些伙伴们发出了呻吟，我的心里也充满了焦急的思虑，开始变得警觉起来，就在这时候有一种奇怪的景象突然吸引了我们的注意力，转移开了我们对自己处境的忧虑。我们觉察到有一辆固定在狗拉雪橇上的低矮的车，正在离我们半英里的地方向北驶去。有一个身形像人但显然更巨大的生物，正坐在雪橇上驾驭着那些狗。我们用望远镜看着那个旅行者疾速地前进着，直到消失在远处崎岖起伏的冰原尽头。

这番景象激起了我们无限的惊异。我们相信自己距离任何陆地都有好几百英里，可是这个怪物的出现却又似乎表明，陆地实际上并不是我们所料想的那样遥远。但因为被冰块紧紧围住，我们尽管极其注意地观察，也无法追寻到他的去向。

在发生这件事之后大约两个小时，我们听到了海底发出的啸声，不到天黑，冰层碎裂了，我们的船解除了囚禁。不过我们还得停在原地等到天亮，害怕在黑暗中会撞上冰层化开以后四处漂浮着的大冰块。我利用这段时间休息了几个小时。

第二天早晨天一亮，我就走到甲板上去，却发现所有的水手都急匆匆地挤到船的一侧，好像正在和海上的什么人谈着话。事实上，船舷下面有一辆雪橇，样子和我们先前见过的相似，它是停在一个大冰块上，在夜里漂到我们跟前来的。只有一条狗还活着，不过雪橇上坐着一个人，水手们正在劝说他到船上来。他并不像前一个旅行者那样仿佛是某个荒岛上的未开化的野人，而是一个欧洲人。我走上甲板的时候，船长说：“这是我们的队长，他是不会让你在大海上死掉的。”

陌生人看见我，便用英语说起话来，只不过带有一种外国腔调。“在我登上您的船之前，”他说，“请先告诉我你们的船开往何处好吗？”

你可以想象到，当我听到一个处在毁灭边缘的人竟向我提出这样一个问题的时候，会有多么的惊讶，我原本料想我的船对他来说应当是无比宝贵的，即使用世上最珍贵的财富来交换他也不会答应哩。不过我还是回答他说，我们正在前往北极探险的航行途中。

他听到这个回答显得很满意，同意到船上来。天啊！玛格丽特，你要是看到这个非要如此才肯为自己的安全向我们屈服的人，你真会感到无限的惊奇。他的四肢几乎冻僵，他的躯体因为劳累和折磨而变得瘦骨嶙峋。我从来没有见过一个人落到如此悲惨的境地。我们试图把他抬进船舱里去，可是他刚一离开新鲜空气就昏了过去。我们只好又把他抬回甲板上，用白兰地擦他的身体，还硬给他灌下了少量的酒，借此让他苏醒过来。他一显出复苏的迹象，我们就用毯子把他裹住，把他放到厨房火炉的烟囱旁边。他一步步地慢慢恢复过来了，还喝了一点儿汤，这可使他大有起色了。

就像这样过了两天，他才有力气讲话。我常常担心他所受的折磨会使他丧失了理解力。当他恢复到一定程度的时候，我把他搬到我的船舱里来，并在我的职务允许的时候全力照料他。我从来没有见过比他更能引起我的兴趣的人了：他的眼睛通常带有一种狂热的，甚至是疯狂的神情，但有的时候，当有人对他做出好意的举动，或者为他提供了任何微不足道的服务时，他的表情又会豁然开朗，仿佛闪耀着一种我从未见过的仁慈而亲切的光彩。不过总的说来他显得既忧郁又绝望，有时候他还咬牙切齿，仿佛难于忍受那压迫着他的痛苦重负似的。

我的客人稍微恢复了一些的时候，要把那些想向他提出一千个问题的人们打发开去，我真是花了很大的力气。不过从他身心的状况来看，要复原显然取决于彻底的休息，我不愿让他受到他们那些毫无意义的好奇心的折磨。不过，有一次我的副手问了他，为什么他会乘坐这样奇怪的一种交通工具，在冰上跑到这么远的地方来？

他的脸上顿时罩上了浓重的荫翳。他回答说：“为了找寻一个逃离我的人。”

“你追寻的人是不是和你用同样的方式在旅行？”

“是的。”

“那么我想我们见过他，因为就在救起你来的前一天，我们看到有几只狗拉着一辆雪橇，上面坐着一个人，横跨过冰原。”

这句话引起了陌生人的注意，他问了许许多多的问题，全都有关那个魔鬼——他这样称呼他——行进的路线。过后不久，当他单独和我待在一起的时候，他说：“毫无疑问，我激起了你以及那些好心人的好奇心。不过你很体贴人，并不向我提问。”

“理所当然。假如我用好奇的探询来打扰你，那我确实是太没道理，也太残酷了。”

“不过你把我从不同寻常的危险处境中救了出来，你仁慈地让我恢复了生命。”

紧接着他便问我，我是否认为碎裂的冰块已经撞毁了那另一辆雪橇？我回答说，我没有任何把握做出答复，因为冰层直到临近半夜才开裂，而那个旅行者在此之前可能就已经到达了某个安全的地方。不过关于这一点我也不能肯定。

从这个时候起，一种新的生命之灵使陌生人正在衰竭的躯体焕发了生机。他表示出最热切的渴望，要到甲板上去，去守望那辆曾经出现过的雪橇。但我劝说他继续留在船舱里，因为他还太虚弱，受不了凛冽刺骨的冷空气。我答应派人去替他守望，只要有任何新物体出现，就会立即通知他的。

这就是到今天为止我的日志中记录的有关这个奇异事件的情况。陌生人的身体渐渐地恢复了健康，但他非常沉默寡言，而且每当有除我之外的任何人走进他的船舱，他就会显得神情不安。不过他的态度却是那样的讨人喜欢和温文尔雅，水手们都对他很感兴趣，尽管他们很少和他交谈。至于我本人，则开始对他怀有一种兄弟般的爱意，他那始终如一的深重的悲哀使我心中充满了同情和怜悯。他在境况顺利的日子里一定是个性格高尚的人，即使是眼下遭难的时候，他也依然是如此具有吸引力，如此和蔼可亲。

亲爱的玛格丽特，我曾经在一封信里说过，在茫茫大海上我是不会找到任何朋友的，然而我现在找到了一个人，在他的精神被痛苦击垮之前，我很高兴有他做我的知心兄弟。

如果有任何新的事件值得记录，我将继续在日志中不时记下有关这个陌生人的情况。

罗·沃

17××年8月15日

我对我的客人的感情与日俱增。他将我的钦敬和怜悯这两种情感都激发到了惊人的程度。我怎么能够眼看着如此高尚的一个人被痛苦摧毁而不感到彻心的悲痛呢？他是这样的温和，又是这样的聪明；他的心智是如此富于修养；他说起话来虽然措辞考究，却滔滔不绝，富于非凡的雄辩力。

现在他已经从病弱状态中大大地恢复过来了，还不停地走到甲板上去，显然是去守望在他之前的那辆雪橇。不过他虽然怏怏不乐，却并非一心只想着自己的痛苦，而是对别人的计划也怀着很浓的兴趣。他经常和我交谈我的计划，这项计划我已经毫无保留地告诉了他。他注意倾听我讲述自己必然成功的所有有利论据，以及我为了确保成功而采取的种种措施的每一点细节。他对我所表露的同情引得我禁不住把心里话和盘托出，我倾诉了我灵魂中那燃烧的激情，还带着令我兴奋的狂热谈到，我将乐于牺牲我的财产、我的生命、我的一切希望，来促成我的事业。为了获得我所寻求的知识，为了我将要获得并将传之于后世的对人类的自然之敌的统治权，付出一个人的生死，只不过是付出了一个渺小的代价而已。就在我说着这番话的时候，一片浓重的阴霾蒙住了我朋友的面容。开始时我感觉到他在极力抑制着自己的感情，他用双手掩住了眼睛。当我看见泪水从他的指缝间不断地涌流——他不停起伏的胸中迸发出一声呻吟的时候，我的声音颤抖得再也说不出话来了。我停住了——他最后说话了，声音断断续续的——“不幸的人哪！你难道和我一样疯狂吗？你难道也喝了那种迷魂汤吗？请听我讲——让我把自己的故事告诉你，你会把你唇边盛着苦酒的杯子摔得粉碎！”

你可以想象到，他的这几句话强烈地激起了我的好奇心。但是这阵突然发作的痛苦攫住了陌生人，摧垮了他虚弱的体力，必须有好几个小时的休息和平静的谈话才能使他恢复镇静。

当他控制住了情感的强烈爆发之后，他似乎为自己屈从于感情冲动而鄙视自己。在克服了阴郁的绝望情绪之后，他又再度引我谈论有关自己的事情。他问起我早年的经历。故事很快就讲完了，可是这唤醒了我的种种思绪。我谈起我希望找到一个朋友——我渴盼和一个朋友的心灵发生比迄今为止所有过的更为亲密无间的契合，我表示自己确信，一个人假如不曾享受到这种恩赐，就不能称许自己幸福。

“我同意你的看法，”陌生人回答道，“如果没有一个比我们更聪明、更美好、更可爱的人——一个朋友理应如此——没有他来帮助我们矫正我们软弱而有缺陷的性格，我们就是未曾完成的生物，只不过被塑造了一半而已。我曾经有一个朋友，他是人类中最高尚的人，因此我有资格来评判有关友谊的问题。你有希望，眼前有整个世界，绝没有理由灰心丧气。然而我——我已经失去了一切，再也不能重新开始生活了。”

他在说这番话的时候，面容上显露出一种安于不幸而听天由命的神情，这深深地打动了我。可是他沉默了，随即回到了他自己的船舱里。

即使他的情绪是如此沮丧，但谁也不如他那样对自然之美怀有深切的感受。繁星密布的天穹，大海，以及这些奇妙的地区所展示出的每一种景象，似乎仍然具有一种使他的心灵升华而超脱尘世的力量。这样的一个人具有双重的生存方式，他可能会受痛苦的折磨，被沮丧失望的情绪压倒，然而，当他退回到自己的内心世界中去的时候，他又像一个头绕光环的神灵，在这片光辉中绝没有悲伤或愚蠢敢于侵入。

你会笑我在谈起这个神灵般的流浪者时所表现出的热情吧？要是你见到他，就不会笑话我了。你从书籍中博采知识，教养优越，而且远离尘世，因此你评判别人也多少有些挑剔，可是正是这一点，更能使你欣赏这个奇妙的人所具有的不同寻常的优点。有时候我极力要去发现到底他具有什么样的品质，才使他大大地超越了我迄今为止所认识的任何人。我相信那是一种出于直觉的辨识力，一种既敏捷而又绝不会失误的判断力，一种深入事物根源的无比清晰准确的洞察力，再加上流畅的表达力，以及抑扬顿挫如抚慰灵魂的音乐般的语调。

17××年8月13日

昨天陌生人对我说：“沃尔顿队长，你也许不难看出，我曾经遭遇过无可比拟的巨大不幸。我一度下定了决心，要让有关那些灾祸的记忆随着我的死亡而归于消灭。可是你使我改变了自己的决定。你正像我曾经做过的那样，追求着知识与智慧，而我却热切地希望在你的愿望实现的时候，它不会像我所经受的那样，成为噬伤你的毒蛇。我不知道讲述自己的灾难是否对你有所裨益，不过，当我想到你正走着和我同样的道路，正面临着把我弄成今天这副模样的相同的危险时，我猜想你也许会从我的故事中吸取出适当的教训。要是你在事业上获得了成功，它可以指导你的行动，万一你失败了，它也可以安慰你。请你准备好倾听通常会被视为不可思议的一连串事件吧。要是我们处在静谧祥和的自然环境中，我或许会担心你将不肯相信我，也许还会嘲笑我，但在这蛮荒而神秘之地，许多事情都似乎成为可能的了，而对于那些并未领略过千变万化的大自然的伟力的人们来说，这一切都只会引得他们发笑罢了——我也毫不怀疑我的故事所包含的事件都具有真实的证据，在一步步进展中它将证明这一点。”

你很容易想象到，他主动提出做这番交谈，我是多么高兴。不过我又不忍心他因为诉说自己的不幸遭遇而再度经受痛苦。我觉得自己之所以怀着最急迫的心情要想听他准备讲述的故事，部分是源于好奇心理，部分则是出于自己想改变他的命运的强烈愿望。我在回答他的时候表示了这些想法。

“谢谢你的同情，”他回答说，“不过这是没用的。我的生命即将结束了。我只等待着发生一件事，然后我将安息。我理解你的感情，”他觉察到我想打断他的话，便接着说，“可是你错了，我的朋友，如果你允许我这样称呼你的话。什么力量也不能改变我的命运。请听我的故事吧，你将明白我的命运是怎样的无可挽回了。”

然后他告诉我，第二天我闲下来的时候他将开始讲述他的故事。我衷心地感谢他的这番许诺。我决定每天晚上当自己没有紧迫事务缠身的时候，尽可能按照他的原话把他白天讲述的事情记下来。万一我忙得没有时间，至少也要做些笔记。这些记录无疑会给你带来极大的乐趣。而对于我来说，我认识他，听过他亲口讲述，在将来的某一天，我又会带着怎样的兴味和同情来重读这些记录啊！甚至就在此刻，当我开始这项工作的时候，他那洪亮饱满的声音还在我的耳中回响，他那光彩奕奕的眼睛还带着忧郁的温情注视着我，我还看见他那瘦削的手举起来做着活泼的手势，而他的面容则闪耀着来自心灵内部的光辉。他的故事一定是奇异而痛苦的，而那吞没了正在航道上行驶的英勇的船舶，并把它损毁到这般地步的风暴，一定是令人惊怖的！

17××年8月19日





第一章　家世


就出生地而言，我是个日内瓦人，我的家族是那个共和国最显赫的家族之一。我的祖辈许多年来一直担任着顾问和市政官，我的父亲则承担过几项公共职务，声誉卓著。他受到所有人的尊敬，大家都知道他为人正直，对公共事务倾心关注，毫不懈怠。他的青年时代始终被国家公务所占据，各种各样的原因使他不可能早早结婚，直到生命的顶峰已过，他才做了丈夫和父亲。

鉴于父亲结婚的情况足以说明他的性格，我不能不加以叙述。他最知心的朋友中有一位是个商人，他因为屡遭不幸，家境从富足堕入贫困。这个人名叫波福，他性情高傲，不愿卑躬屈膝，要他在自己曾因富贵而显赫一时的国家里过贫穷和默默无闻的生活，他感到不堪忍受。因此，当他以最体面的方式偿付了债务之后，便和女儿退隐到了琉森市，在那里过着隐姓埋名和苦不堪言的生活。我父亲以最真诚的友谊爱着波福，对他落入这种不幸的境遇深感痛心。无谓的自傲心理导致他的朋友采取了这样一个配不上他们之间感情的行动，他感到痛惜。他刻不容缓地极力要找到他们，希望能够说服他凭借自己的信誉和帮助来重建家业。

波福采取了有效的措施使自己隐匿起来，父亲足足花了十个月的时间才探知到他的住处。这一发现使他欣喜异常，他急匆匆地赶往坐落在路斯附近一条简陋小街上的那所房屋。可是，当他走进屋子的时候，面对的只是悲惨和绝望。波福从破败的家产中只保住了很小的一笔钱，不过它倒是足以维持几个月的生活开支，在这段时间里，他希望能在一家商行里找到一分体面的工作。然而这段光阴结果却是毫无作为地浪费掉了。一旦有空闲来进行思考的时候，他的不幸便显得越发深重、越发痛心，到最后痛苦紧紧地攫住了他的心，以至于他在三个月以后缠绵病榻，再也无法进行任何努力了。

他的女儿极其体贴细心地照料他，可是她又绝望地眼看着那一小笔钱飞快地减少，却指望不到有任何的接济。不过卡罗琳·波福具有卓绝不凡的精神，她勇气倍增地支撑着自己来对付逆境。她找低微的活计来干，她编织草帽，她还用其他种种办法来挣得一点微薄的工钱，勉强维持着生活。

几个月就像这样过去了。她父亲的病情更严重了，她的时间更得用来照料他，她赖以谋生的收入日益减少。到了第十个月，她父亲在她的怀抱中去世，撇下她一个孤女，只能做一个乞丐。这个最后的打击使她完全崩溃了。当我的父亲进屋的时候，她正跪在波福的棺材边哀声痛哭。他就像一个保护神似的来到可怜的姑娘身旁，而她则把自己完全交给他来照顾。父亲在给朋友送葬之后，把她带到了日内瓦，送到一个亲戚家照料。这事过去两年以后，卡罗琳做了他的妻子。

我父母的年龄有相当大的差距，但这种情况却似乎使他们愈加倾心相爱。我父亲那正直的胸怀中存在着一种正义感，这使得他必然会高度赞许强烈的爱情。或许他在早年曾经恋爱过，因为发现所爱的人并不值得他爱而饱受痛苦，所以更珍视经受过磨难考验的有价值的东西。在他对我母亲的依恋之情里表现出某种感激和敬慕，这与一般老年丈夫对年轻妻子的溺爱完全不同，因为激发起这种爱的力量是父亲对母亲的美德的崇敬，以及要在某种程度上补偿她所经受过的不幸的强烈愿望，而正是因为这一点，他对母亲的态度便含有一种无法表达的慈爱之情。他做每一件事都顺从她的意愿，符合她的习惯。他努力保护她，就像园丁保护他美丽的奇花异草不受暴风的伤害一样，他还尽一切可能，让她的生活环绕着可以在她温柔而宽厚的心中激起欢乐的事物。她的健康，以及她素来坚韧而宁静的精神气质，都因她所经受的苦难而受到了损害。在他们婚前两年时间里，我父亲就逐渐放弃了他担任的所有公职。结婚以后，他们随即动身旅行，希望意大利那温暖宜人的气候，以及在那片神奇土地的旅行和变化无穷的景物和乐趣，有利于我母亲虚弱身体的康复。

他们又从意大利到了德国和法国。我是他们的长子，就出生在那不勒斯，还是个婴儿时就随他们四处漫游。好几年里我是他们唯一的孩子。尽管他们彼此倾心相爱，但他们又从爱情的源泉里汲取了无穷无尽的爱来倾注到我的身上。我母亲温柔的爱抚，我父亲凝视着我的时候那充满慈爱的欢乐的微笑，这便是我人生之初最早的印象。我是他们的玩具和偶像，但绝不仅此——我是他们的孩子，是上天赐予他们的天真无邪却又幼弱无助的生命，他们要抚育我健康成长，我未来的命运就在他们手中，根据他们如何对我尽责任，我或者走向幸福，或者通往不幸。他们深深意识到他们对于自己赋予生命的孩子肩负着怎样的责任，再加上他们两个人都富于活泼而温柔的性情，可以想象，我幼年生活的每时每刻都接受着关于耐心、仁爱和自我克制的教育，但引导我的却是一条温柔的丝带，我只觉得一切都充满了欢乐。

在很长时间里我都是他们唯一的关怀对象。母亲非常渴望能有一个女儿，可是我一直是他们的独生子。在我五岁的时候，他们去意大利边界那一带短途旅游，在科摩河畔度过了一周。出于仁慈的天性，他们常常去穷人的茅屋造访。这对于我母亲来说，不仅仅是一种责任，更是一种需要，一种强烈感情——她想起自己受过的苦难，自己又是如何得到解救的——现在轮到她来做穷苦人的保护天使了。在一次散步的时候，山谷的沟壑里一所破茅屋那孤零零的凄惨模样吸引了他们的注意力，同时茅屋周围还聚集着一群衣不蔽体的孩子，更足以说明这家人贫穷到了极点。有一天，当我父亲独自一人去了米兰的时候，母亲就带上我去访问这户人家。她看到一个农民和他的妻子，都是吃苦耐劳却又被忧虑和劳累压垮了的人，正在把很少一点的食物分发给五个饥饿的孩子。孩子当中有一个特别引起了母亲的注意。她看起来属于和其他孩子不同的血统。其他四个都是黑眼睛、身板坚韧的小流浪儿，这个孩子身体却很单薄，相貌秀美。她的头发是明亮耀眼的金色，尽管衣衫破烂，头上却仿佛戴着尊荣的冠冕。她的额头长得明净而饱满，蓝色的眼睛晶莹明澈，她的嘴唇和脸型是那样富于感情和充满甜美，谁见了也不能不觉得她气质不凡，仿佛是来自天堂，处处都像一个天使。

那农妇觉察到我母亲目不转睛地盯着这个可爱的女孩，眼里充满惊奇和赞赏，便急切地讲述了她的身世。女孩并不是她的孩子，而是米兰的一个贵族的女儿。她的母亲是个德国人，在生养她的时候死去。这个婴儿托付给了这个好人家抚养，而当时他们的境况还很好。他们结婚不久，最大的孩子也才刚刚出世。这个受托养的女孩的父亲，是在缅怀意大利古老光荣的精神熏陶之下成长起来的意大利人——激进党的一个成员，为了祖国的自由而竭力奋斗。他成了软弱的祖国的牺牲品。他到底是死了呢，还是仍在奥地利的地牢里苟延残喘，这可谁也不知道。他的财产被没收了，他的孩子则成了一个孤儿和乞丐。她继续留在她的养父母身边，在他们这粗陋的家中奇葩独放，比一朵在黑叶荆棘丛中的庭园玫瑰还要美丽。

当父亲从米兰归来的时候，他发现我正在别墅的大厅里和一个比画中天使还要美的孩子一起玩耍——她的面容似乎放射着光辉，她的体态和动作比山上的小羚羊还要轻捷。天使的出现很快就被解释清楚了。母亲得到了父亲的许可，说服了她的农民保护人把抚养孩子的责任转让给了她。他们本来很喜欢这个可爱的孤儿，有她住在自己家中就好像是他们的一种福分，不过现在天意使她得到了这样强有力的保护，那么再让她继续处于贫穷和匮乏之中，对她来说也就不公平了。他们请教了乡村教士，其结果是伊丽莎白·拉文查住进了我父母亲的房子——成了我的比妹妹还亲的妹妹——成了我一切活动和游乐的美好的、备受敬慕的伴侣。

每个人都喜欢伊丽莎白。大家都对她怀着热烈的，几乎是崇敬般的爱，而当我也分享这种情感的时候，则感到是我的骄傲和欢乐。在她被接到我家的前一天晚上，我母亲曾开玩笑地对我说：“我有一件珍贵的礼物要送给我的维克多——明天他就会得到它。”第二天，当她把她许诺的礼物伊丽莎白带来给我的时候，我却以孩子气的认真劲儿把她的话当了真，认为伊丽莎白就是属于我的——该由我来保护、爱和珍惜。人们对她的一切赞美，我都当作是对属于我的东西的赞美来加以接受。我们之间亲昵地以表兄妹称呼。她与我的关系是用任何词语、用任何表达方式都无法描绘的——她是我的比妹妹还亲的妹妹，从那时起直到她死去，她都是只属于我的。





第二章　初涉古代科学


我们在一起长大。我们的年龄相差还不到一岁。我用不着说明，任何不睦和争吵都与我们无缘。和谐是我们友谊的灵魂，我们性格中所存在的差异和对照使我们更加亲近。伊丽莎白的性情比较沉静，也比较专注，而我尽管热情洋溢，却能够更热切地从事工作，内心更充满了对知识的渴求。她总是忙于追寻诗人们空幻缥缈的想象，在我们瑞士住宅周围的宏伟而奇妙的景物中，她找到了使自己赞叹惊喜的一切——山岳的雄伟、四季的更迭、狂风暴雨与和风丽日、冬日的寂静与阿尔卑斯山夏日的生机勃勃和急风湍流。当我的伴侣带着严肃而满足的心情沉思着事物恢宏壮丽的面貌的时候，我却兴致勃勃地探究着事物的来龙去脉。对于我来说，世界是一个我渴望穷究的秘密。好奇而热切地要了解大自然的奥秘法则，每当发现奥秘时那种近乎狂喜的快乐，这些就是我所能记忆起的最初的感情。

父母在生了比我小七岁的第二个儿子以后，便完全放弃了他们的漫游生活，在自己的祖国定居下来。我们在日内瓦有一幢房子，在日内瓦湖东岸离城三英里多的贝尔莱弗还有一处乡村别墅。我们大部分时间都住在乡村别墅里，父母过着远离尘嚣的退隐生活。我生性不喜欢与太多的人交往，总是对不多几个人怀着热烈的感情。因此我对同学们一般都很淡漠，却和其中的一个结下了亲密的友谊。亨利·克莱瓦尔是日内瓦一个商人的儿子。这是个才能出众、想象超群的男孩。他富于事业心，不畏艰苦，甚至喜欢为了冒险的乐趣而冒险。他耽读骑士小说和传奇故事。他还谱写英雄歌谣，动手编写了许多有关魔法巫术和骑士冒险的故事。他试图让我们表演戏剧，参加假面舞会，舞会中的角色都取自隆塞斯瓦尔英雄(1)、亚瑟王的圆桌骑士(2)以及抛洒鲜血从异教徒手中夺回圣墓的骑士系列(3)。

没有谁的童年能比我过得更幸福了。我的父母具有一种慈爱而又放任的态度。我们感到他们并不是执拗任性地主宰我们命运的暴君，而是使我们得以享受到一切欢乐的动因和创造者。当我和其他的家庭处在一起的时候，我便清楚地感受到我自己的命运是特别的幸福，而且心中所怀的感激也使我的孝顺之心与日俱增。

我的脾气有时候很暴躁，情感有时候也很强烈，不过，由于天性中的某种法则，我的性格并未向一般孩子们的爱好发展，却是热切地渴望学习，而且不是毫无选择地一概都学。我承认，无论是语言的结构，政府的法规，或是各国的政治，对我来说都没有吸引力。我所渴望学习的乃是天体和地球的奥秘，让我倾心的不论是事物的外部实体，还是自然界的内部精神，或者是人的神秘莫测的灵魂，总之我所要探究的是这个世界上的物质的秘密。与此同时，克莱瓦尔全力以赴研究的，则可以说是世界的道德关系。匆忙变幻的人生舞台，英雄们的美德，伟人的业绩，这些就是他的研究题材。他的希望和梦想是要做那些名垂青史的人当中的一员，做勇敢而富于冒险精神的、造福于人类的人。伊丽莎白那圣洁的灵魂，则像奉献给祭坛的明灯一样照耀着我们和平安宁的家。她的感情和我们息息相通，她的微笑，她的柔声细语，她那天使般的眼睛的甜美目光，总使我们充满幸福和生气。她是活生生的爱的精神，使我心灵平和，为她所吸引：要不是有她在身边驯服着我，使我也变得像她那样温柔的话，我也许会因为冥思苦学而变得性情阴郁，或者因为天性热烈而变得粗俗狂暴。克莱瓦尔呢——难道克莱瓦尔那高尚的精神中会有什么缺陷吗——然而要是没有伊丽莎白向他展示仁慈之心何以真正可爱，使他把善行义举作为他的凌云壮志的追求目标，那么他的慷慨胸襟也不会如此富于人性，如此体贴周到，他对于冒险事业的热情也不会如此富于仁爱和温情。

我现在沉浸于对童年往事的回忆中时，便感到异常的快乐，那时不幸还没有败坏我的心灵，我对未来那广阔而富于作为的前景的幻想，也没有变为对自我的阴郁而狭隘的思考。不过我在描绘早年生活的图景的时候，也要记下那些在不知不觉之中一步步将我引向日后灾难的事件。因为当我要向自己解释那种后来主宰我的命运的强烈感情来自何处时，我发现它就像一条山间的河流，是由微不足道的，几乎不为人知的源头汇聚而成的，但它越流越宽广，渐渐变成了滚滚洪流，终于奔腾而下，卷走了我的一切希望与欢乐。

自然哲学便是那支配了我的命运的精灵，因此在叙述中，我要想说明那些导致我对这门科学发生偏爱的事件。在我十三岁那年，我们一家到桑侬附近的温泉去游玩，由于天气恶劣，我们有一天不得不待在旅店里。在屋里，我偶然地发现了一卷科讷利乌斯·阿格里帕(4)的著作。我毫无兴趣地翻开了它，可是作者试图阐明的理论和他叙述的那些奇妙的事实，却很快把我的冷漠感变成了热情。似乎有一道新的光明照射进了我的思想。我欣喜若狂，把自己的发现告诉了父亲。父亲漫不经心地扫了一眼书的扉页，说：“噢！科讷利乌斯·阿格里帕！亲爱的维克多，不要在这本书上浪费你的时间，它毫无价值。”

假如父亲不做这样的评论，而是耐心地向我解释阿格里帕的原理已经被完全推翻了，我们有了现代科学体系，它具有比古代体系强大得多的力量，因为后者只是些空中楼阁而已，而前者才是真实的和实际可行的，那么，在这样的情况下，我一定会把阿格里帕丢到一边，以更大的热情回到我过去的研究中去，以此来满足我强烈的想象力。甚至我的思想进程，也可能不会接受那种导致我毁灭的致命冲动了。然而父亲只是对我的书草草地扫上一眼，这绝不能使我相信他知道其中的内容，于是我便如饥似渴地继续读下去。

我回家以后，第一件事就是设法找来阿格里帕的全部著作，然后又找到巴拉塞尔苏斯(5)和阿尔伯图斯·马格努斯(6)的著作。我欣喜地阅读和研究这些作家的放任不羁的幻想；对于我来说，它们似乎是除我之外便很少有人知道的稀世珍宝。我曾经形容自己总是满怀着要穿透自然奥秘的狂热欲望。尽管现代哲学家们辛苦劳作获得了许多惊人的发现，但是，我在研究他们的著作之余，总是感到不能满意和餍足。据说艾萨克·牛顿爵士(7)曾经断言，在伟大的有待探索的真理的大海面前，他就像个在海滨拾取贝壳的孩子。在自然哲学的各个分支里，我所知道的那些牛顿的继承者们，在我这个孩子的心目中也不过是些继续在海边捡贝壳的新手而已。

一个没有受过教育的农民能看到他身边的各种事物，知道它们的实际用途。而最博学的哲学家却并不比一个农民懂得更多。他只不过部分地揭开了自然的面纱，可是自然不朽的面容对他来说却仍然奥妙无穷、深不可测。他可以分解、剖析、命名，但是，他说不出最终的原因，甚至第二层次和第三层次的原因，他也一无所知。我曾经注目凝视那些使人类无法进入自然的城堡的重重要塞和关卡，自己只知道鲁莽无知地怨天尤人。

可是现在有了这些书籍，有了这些钻研得更深、懂得更多的人。对于他们的论断，我深信不疑，我成了他们的信徒。乍看起来会显得奇怪，像这样的事竟会发生在18世纪，可是，尽管我在日内瓦的学校里按部就班地接受着正规教育，但我在很大程度上却自学着自己喜爱的学问。我的父亲并不懂科学，于是我只好以孩子的盲目性和一个学生对知识的渴求来自我奋斗了。在我新得到的导师的指引下，我开始废寝忘食地探寻点金术和长生不老药，不过我很快就专心致志地研究后者了。财富只是一个低级的目标，然而，假如我能够消除人类身体上的疾病，使人除了因外力伤害致死以外便平安无恙，那么这一发现将会获得怎样的光荣啊！

这些还远不是我的唯一幻想。我所倾心的这些作家还热情地赞同说，召唤幽灵和魔鬼是可望实现的，这可是我最渴望完成的事业了。而且，要是我的咒语总是不能奏效的话，我便把失败归因于我自己经验不足或是方法有误，而不是怀疑我的导师们的本领和可靠性有问题。这样，在一段时期内，我全身心地投入到那些早已被破除了的体系之中，受狂热的想象和幼稚的推理的引导，就像一个笨拙无知的家伙那样，把上千种相互矛盾的理论搅和在一起，在五花八门的知识的泥泞里拼命地挣扎，直到一桩偶然事件改变了我的思路为止。

大约在我十五岁的时候，我们一家迁回到了贝尔里芙附近的老屋，在那里，我们目睹了一场最猛烈、最恐怖的大风暴。它从尤拉群山后面向这里袭来，雷霆顿时以可怕的声音在天空的各个方向轰响。在风暴持续期间，我怀着好奇和快乐的心理观察它的进程。我站在门口，突然看见离我们的房屋大约二十码的一棵美丽的老橡树喷出了一股火流。就在那阵炫目的火光消失的瞬刻，橡树也消失了，除了被电火烧焦了的树桩以外，什么也没有留下。第二天早晨我们去看它，发现橡树被毁坏的情况很奇特。它并没有被雷电劈成碎块，而是完全变成了细细的木丝。我从来没有见到过有什么东西被摧毁到如此彻底的地步。

在此之前，我对比较明显的电学规律也并非毫无所知。就在发生这件事的时候，一位在自然哲学方面研究很深的客人正住在我家，他也为这件灾变感到激动，便向我们解释了他在电学和流电学方面所建立的理论，使我觉得既新鲜又惊讶。他所讲的一切让那些主宰我的想象的大师们，例如科讷利乌斯·阿格里帕、阿尔伯图斯·马格努斯、巴拉塞尔苏斯，都黯然失色了。由于某种命运的安排，这些大师的地位被推翻以后，我也就不再追求先前熟悉了的学问了。对我来说，似乎任何东西也不会或者说不可能被人所了解了。一切曾经长期吸引我的注意力的东西，突然间变得可鄙了。由于我们在年轻时最容易染上的那种思想反复无常的毛病，我即刻放弃了过去的工作。我把自然史以及它所派生出的所有学科都看作残缺畸形、发育不全的产物。我对那种自诩的所谓科学怀着极大的轻蔑，认为它根本不可能跨进真正知识的门槛哪怕一步。在这种情绪下，我开始着手研究数学，以及与数学有关的其他分支，因为它建立在牢固的基础之上，非常值得我去学习。

我们心灵的构造就是这样的奇怪，我们注定是获得幸运或遭到毁灭，就取决于这样一些微小的环节。当我回顾过去的时候，我觉得自己之所以匪夷所思地改变了兴趣和意愿，那是我命运的保护神直接给予了启示——当雷电高悬在星际，准备把我吞没的时候，是我的保护神做了最后的努力，把雷电转移到了旁边去。在我抛弃了那些近来折磨我的古代学问以后，我的心灵感到了异常的宁静和欢悦，这也宣告了我的保护神的胜利。就是因为这种力量我才懂得了，照古人那样做是邪恶的，而抛弃他们才能幸福。

这是善良之神的一次强有力的努力，可是并没有发生效力。命运之神太强大了，它那不可更改的法律已经注定了我必将遭到彻底的、可怕的毁灭。

第三章　大学里难忘的一天


在我满17岁的时候，父母决定让我到英戈尔施塔特(1)大学去读书。到那时为止我都是在日内瓦上学，不过父亲认为我要接受完整的教育，就必须熟悉除了祖国之外的别的国家的风俗习惯。因此，我的行期很早就已确定了。可是在预定的日子到来之前，我一生中的第一件不幸发生了——这似乎是一个不祥之兆，预示着我未来的灾难。

伊丽莎白患上了猩红热。她的病情很严重，处在生命垂危之中。在她患病的时候，我们提出了许多理由来劝母亲不要护理她。起初母亲还听从我们的请求，可是当她听说她心爱的伊丽莎白生命有危险的时候，就再也不能控制自己忧虑的心情了。她亲自到病榻前去看护——她的精心照料战胜了凶险的瘟疫——伊丽莎白被挽救过来了，可是这轻率的行动却对她的救护者产生了致命的后果。到第三天母亲就病了，伴随着高热出现了可怕的症状，从看护她的护士的眼神中可以看出情况已经到了最坏的地步。在她弥留之际，这位最优秀的女性还保持着刚毅而慈祥的天性。她把伊丽莎白和我的手合在一起——“我的孩子，”她说，“我对未来幸福的最坚定的希望就寄托在你们的结合上。期望着这件事的实现，将是对你们的父亲的安慰。伊丽莎白，我亲爱的，你不得不代替我来照料我年幼的孩子了。啊！我真惋惜我被迫离开你们，我一直是那么幸福，享受着大家的爱，我怎么舍得抛下你们大家？可是我不应该怀有这样的想法，我要努力使自己坚强些，高高兴兴地去面对死亡，怀抱着在另一个世界里和你们相聚的希望。”

她平静地去世了。即使在死后，她的面容仍然流露出慈爱之情。我无须形容在被无法弥补的不幸夺走了最亲的亲人之后，大家内心的感受，那种心灵上的空虚，以及在神情中显露出来的绝望。我们好不容易才能使自己相信，我们每天都见到的、构成了我们自己生命的一部分的她， 已经永远地离去了——那一双可爱的眼睛的光辉已经熄灭了，我们感到那么熟悉和亲切的声音也沉默了，永远也听不见了。这些就是母亲去世以后我们最初一段时间的反应。然而，当时光流逝，不幸被证明为是事实以后，真正的哀痛便开始袭来了。不过，谁又未曾被死神粗暴的手夺走过亲人呢？我为什么要去描述一种所有的人都感受过的，而且不免将要感受的痛苦呢？终于到了这样的时候，忧伤已经不再是必要的，一味忧伤只会是放纵感情，唇边露出的微笑，虽然可能被视为对死者不敬，倒也不必禁止。母亲已经去世了，我们还有自己应尽的责任，我们应该和其他亲人一道继续走我们的路，只要一个人还没有被死神夺去生命，就应当学会为自己庆幸。

我到英戈尔施塔特去的行期因为这一系列的变故而推迟了，现在又再次决定了启程的日子。我得到父亲的同意，在家里再住上几个星期。我觉得马上就离开像死亡一样沉寂的、还处在哀悼气氛中的家，很快就投入喧嚷忙碌的人生，那是对母亲的亵渎。我还是初尝痛苦的滋味，但痛苦对我的震撼并不因此就更轻微。我不愿意离开仍留人世的亲人，尤其是，我渴望让我心爱的伊丽莎白获得某种程度的安慰。

伊丽莎白的确掩盖起了自己的哀伤，并且努力地充当我们大家的安慰者。她坚定不移地面对生活，带着勇气和热忱担负起生活的责任。她把自己全身心地献给了她自幼就称为叔叔和表兄弟的人。她脸上重新显露出阳光一般明亮的笑容，用这光辉照耀着我们大家，这时候她真是显得前所未有的动人。在极力让大家忘却悲伤的时候，她甚至忘掉了自己的悲伤。

我启程的日子终于到来了。克莱瓦尔和我们一道度过了最后的夜晚。他曾经努力说服他的父亲准许他陪伴我，做我的同学，但只是徒劳。他的父亲是个头脑狭隘的生意人，认为儿子的雄心抱负是虚度光阴，会毁掉自己的一生。亨利为自己不能接受广泛的人文教育而深感不幸。他很少说话，不过他一旦开口，我就从他那闪闪发光的眼睛和生气勃勃的目光里看出被克制住的坚定决心，他是绝不会被可悲的商务琐事束缚住的。

我们一直坐到夜深人静。我们简直不忍分手，也不忍说出那两个字：“再见！”最后我们还是说了。我们都借口要去休息了，每个人都自以为骗过了对方。第二天黎明，我下楼走向将要载我离去的马车前时，他们都已到了那里——父亲再一次祝福我，克莱瓦尔再一次紧握我的手，我的伊丽莎白再一次请求我经常写信来，临别前最后向她童年的伴侣和朋友给予了女性的关心。

我坐在那辆将要载我远行的马车里，沉浸在最为忧郁的思绪之中。我，一直生活在亲切的伴侣当中，大家都努力给彼此带来欢乐，而现在却孤身一人了。在我即将前往的那所大学里，我必须自己去交朋友，自己保护自己了。我至今为止的生活是十分封闭、局限于家庭内部的，这使我对于陌生的面孔怀有不可克服的厌恶心理。我爱我的兄弟们，伊丽莎白，还有克莱瓦尔，这些都是我“长期熟悉的面孔”。我相信自己完全不适宜和陌生人相处。这些便是我在旅程开始时的想法。不过，随着马车前行，我的情绪开始好转了，希望也开始萌发。我热烈地渴求着获取知识。在家的时候，我时常觉得青年时代蜷缩在一个地方是非常难受的，我渴望着走进世界，在其他人当中取得自己的位置。现在这样正符合我的愿望，后悔可真是在犯傻。

在前去英戈尔施塔特的漫长而令人疲惫的旅程中，我有足够的闲暇来考虑这些事以及其他许多事。最后，那座城市高高的白色尖塔映入了我的眼帘。我下了马车，被引入了我单独居住的房间，随意消磨这个夜晚。

第二天早晨，我递交了引荐信，拜访了几位主要的教授。出于机缘——或者不如说是由于邪恶的力量、那个毁灭之神，它从我勉强自己离开父亲的大门那一刻起，便以无所不能的威力主宰着我——我首先拜访的是克伦普先生，自然哲学教授。他是一个作风粗鲁的人，但是精通他那门学科的奥秘。针对我在有关自然哲学的各种分支学科方面的进展程度，他向我提出了几个问题。我随意地做了回答，还半带轻蔑地提到了一些炼金家的名字，那是我曾经研读过的主要作家。教授瞪大了眼睛。“难道你，”他说，“真的浪费时间去研究过这些荒唐无稽的东西？”

我做了肯定的答复。“每一分钟，”他热情地继续说，“你浪费在这些书籍上的每一瞬刻，都完全彻底地白扔了。你让那些被批驳得体无完肤的体系和毫无用处的名词重压在你的记忆上。天啊！你生活在什么穷乡僻壤里啊，那里竟然没有一个人好心地告诉你，你所贪婪地吸收的奇思怪想，已经是几千年前的老古董，都是些老得发霉的东西？我简直料想不到，在如今这个思想开化和科学昌明的时代，居然还会发现一个阿尔伯图斯·马格努斯和巴拉塞尔苏斯的信徒。我亲爱的先生，你必须彻底从头开始学习。”

他一边说，一边走到旁边，开列了几本关于自然哲学的书籍，希望我去找来阅读。在让我离开之前，他还提到从下礼拜开始，他将要就自然哲学的总体关系做一系列的演讲，而且他的同事沃德曼教授，在他隔日不讲课的日子里要讲授化学。

我回了家，并不觉得失望，因为我已经说过，我早就认为教授所斥责的那些作家讲的都毫无用处。但是我从教授那里回家时，也完全无心去重新研究其他任何形式的学问。克伦普先生是个矮胖的人，说话粗鲁生硬，相貌令人不快，因此这位导师不能使我对他所研究的学问发生兴趣。我在前面已经用或许过分富于哲理和联想的方式解释过了，我早年就对这些学问下过结论。还是个孩子的时候，我就不满足于现代自然科学的教授们所许诺的研究成就。只是由于我太年轻，思想混乱，再加之在这些问题上缺乏指导，我沿着时光流逝的道路一步步按知识发展的脚步走，没有学习现代科学研究的种种发现，却接触了被人遗忘的炼金家们的梦想。此外，我还对现代自然哲学的实际用途抱着鄙视态度。那些古代科学大师们寻求长生不老和超自然的力量的时候，是另一番情况，那些想法，虽然毫无结果，但总是辉煌壮丽的，可是现在情况改变了。现代研究者仿佛仅仅志在消除那些幻想，而我对科学的兴趣却主要是建立在这些幻想上的。他们却要求我将无比壮丽的奇思异想换成价值微不足道的实际事物。

这就是我在英戈尔施塔特住下后最初两三天里的想法，这几天时间，我大半花在熟悉环境和结识新居附近的主要居民上面。在第二个礼拜开始的时候，我记起了克伦普教授告诉过我的关于课程的事。尽管我并不情愿去听那个矮小的骄傲自负的家伙站在讲坛上宣讲，但我想起了他谈的有关沃德曼先生的话，我还没有见到过他，因为他一直没在城里。

部分出于好奇，部分出于无所事事，我进了教室，不一会儿，沃德曼先生也进来了。这位教授和他的同事大不相同。他看上去五十左右年纪，模样非常和蔼可亲，两鬓有几缕灰白头发，而脑后的头发却几乎是乌黑的。他个头不高，但身材挺拔，而且我从未听过像他说话时那样悦耳的声音。演讲开始的时候，他扼要地回顾了化学的发展史，以及不同的博学之士所做出的各种各样的贡献，提到那些最杰出的发现者时，他热情迸发地说出他们的姓名。随后，他简略地概述了这门科学的现状，并且解释了许多化学的基本术语。在做完了几项准备性的实验以后，他以对现代化学的赞颂作为结束，那番话我永远也不能忘怀——

“这门科学的古代的导师们，”他说，“宣称能实现不可能的事，却什么也没能做成。现代的大师们很少许诺，他们知道金属不可能由别的物质变来，长生不老药只是痴心妄想。然而这些双手似乎只配搅弄污物、眼睛盯着显微镜和坩埚的哲学家们，却的确创造出了奇迹。他们穿透了自然的深处，揭示出它的内部作用的规律。他们上升到天空，他们发现了血液是怎样进行循环的，了解了我们所呼吸的空气的性质。他们获得了新的，几乎是无限的力量。他们能控制天上的雷霆，模拟地震，甚至嘲弄那个不可见的世界以及那个世界的幽灵。”

这些就是那位教授讲的话——倒不如说那是些决定我命运的话，讲出来是要毁灭我的。在他讲话的时候，我觉得我的灵魂正在和一个可以触摸到的敌人进行格斗，构成我的生命机体的各个琴键被一个接一个地敲击了，我的心弦被一根接一根地拨响了，很快，我的头脑里充满了一种思想，一个念头，一个目的。弗兰肯斯坦的灵魂高叫道，别人已经做了那么多的事情——我要完成得更多，更多更多：踏着前人的脚印，我将开辟出一条新路，探索人们还不知道的力量，向世界展示创造力的最幽深的奥秘。

当天夜里我没有阖眼。我的内心处在天翻地覆、骚动混乱的状态中，我感到新秩序将会从中产生，可是我没有力量完成它。到黎明以后，睡意才渐渐袭来。醒来后，我觉得昨晚想的一切都恍然如梦。留下的只有一个决心，要回到我对古代学说的研究上去，要献身于一门我相信自己具有天分的科学。就在这一天，我去拜访了沃德曼先生。他在私下里的言谈风度比公开场合里显得还更加温和动人。因为在他演讲的时候，态度里有着某种尊严的气度，在他自己家里，则被极为和蔼亲切的态度所取代。我曾经给他的同事讲述过自己过去的研究情况，现在我都几乎原原本本地讲给他听了。他仔细地听着我关于自己研究的简短叙述，听见我提到科讷利乌斯·阿格里帕和巴拉塞尔苏斯的名字时，他微笑了，但并不含有像克伦普先生所表现出的那种轻蔑。他说：“现代哲学家们的大部分知识基础，都受惠于这些人的不屈不挠的热忱。他们在很大程度上已经揭示了许多事实，而留给我们一项比较容易的工作，那就是给以新的命名，加以相互联系和安排分类。这些天才人物的劳动，不管是怎样地误入歧途，没有不是最终造福于人类的实际利益的。”我听着他的这番话，说得既不专横武断，也不带偏激的感情，然后我又补充说，他的演讲消除了我对于现代化学家的偏见。我以一个年轻人对他的导师所应有的谦恭和尊敬，字斟句酌地表达了自己的意思，丝毫没有泄漏（因为缺乏生活经验，我本会因说漏嘴而让自己羞愧的）那种激励我想要进行某种研究的热情。我请他指点我必须阅读哪些书籍。

“我很高兴收了一个弟子，”沃德曼先生说，“如果你所希望得到的和你的能力相称，我绝不怀疑你会成功。化学是自然哲学的一个分支，它已经取得了，而且可能再取得极大的进展，就是因为这个原因，我才以它作为我专门研究的学问。不过我同时也并未忽视其他的科学分支。一个人假如只局限于人类知识的这一个部门，那么他只能做一个拙劣的化学家。如果你的志愿是要成为一个真正的科学家，而不仅仅是一个渺小的实验者，我建议你研究自然哲学的每一个分支，包括数学。”

然后他把我带进了他的实验室，向我解释了各种器械的用途，指点我必须置备哪些设备，还允诺道，假如我在科学上达到了较高程度，不至于损坏设备的功能，便可以使用他的设备。他还给我开列了我所要的书目，然后我就告辞了。

就这样，我结束了难忘的一天：它决定了我未来的命运。

第四章　狂热的工作


从那一天起，自然哲学，特别是在最广泛的意义上的化学，几乎成了我唯一的学习内容。我满怀热情地阅读现代研究者们在这些课题上撰写的著作，它们是那样的天才横溢和慎思明辨。我去听大学里科学家的演讲，发展与他们的关系。我甚至发现克伦普先生也颇具健全的思想和真实学问，的确，那是与令人不快的相貌和态度结合在一起的，但并不因为这一点就影响了它们的价值。沃德曼先生则成了我真正的朋友。他温文尔雅，丝毫也不武断。他对我的教导坦率而真诚，绝无一点迂腐的空谈。他用尽各种方法为我铺平学习知识的道路，把最深奥难解的问题阐述得清楚明白，让我易于理解。开始时，我的研究工作还是起伏波动、犹豫不决的，但随着我进行下去而渐渐获得了力量，不久我就变得那样的热诚和急切，以致当星星在晨曦中消失的时候，我往往还在实验室里工作着。

因为我如此专心致志地工作，所以不难想象我的进步是很快的。我的热忱确实使学生们惊讶，而我对知识的掌握也引起了老师们的惊奇。克伦普教授常常带着顽皮的微笑问我，科讷利乌斯·阿格里帕进展得如何啊？沃德曼教授则对我的进步表示由衷的欣喜。两年光阴就这样度过了，在此期间我没有回过一次日内瓦，而是全身心地投入到我希望能有所发现的研究工作之中。只有体验过这一切的人，才能想象到科学那迷人的魅力。在其他的学科中，你最多只能走到前人已经到达的那样远，再也没有更多的东西可以了解，然而在科学的探求中总不断有发现和奇迹。一个才智平平的人，只要专注于一种研究，也一定会成为这种研究里博大精深的专家。我呢，因为坚持不懈地努力要在一种研究目标上有所成就，而且全身心地投入到里面，所以进展非常迅速，到了两年的末尾，我便在某些化学仪器的改进方面有了一些发现，这使我在大学里获得了人们高度的尊重和敬佩。当我到达这一点的时候，建立在英戈尔施塔特教授们的课程基础上的有关自然哲学的理论和实践，我已经了如指掌，这样，我继续住在这里，已无助于我学业的进步，于是我考虑返回亲友的身边，回家乡去。就在这时候却发生了一件事，使我滞留在当地。

特别吸引我的注意力的现象之一，是人类身体的构造，而且包括任何具有生命的动物的构造。我常常问自己，生命的本源到底从何而来？这是一个大胆的问题，并且是一个从来就被视为神秘莫测的问题，可是，如果不是因为胆怯和漫不经心限制了我们的探究，我们本来应该接近了解许许多多事物的边缘了。我在心里翻来覆去地思考着这些情况，最后决定要更加注重研究与生理学有关的那些自然哲学的分支。要不是我被一种几乎不可思议的热情所激励的话，我进行的这项研究本来会是枯燥乏味、近乎不堪忍受的。要考察生命的起源，首先必须追溯到死亡。我已经熟悉了解剖学，可是这还不够，我还得观察人体的自然衰朽和腐坏的过程。在我接受教育的时候，父亲曾特别小心不让我的心灵受到半点超自然的恐怖事物的影响。在我的回忆中，我从来未曾因听了一个迷信故事而吓得发抖，也未曾害怕过什么鬼魂的显灵。黑暗绝不会使我胡思乱想，教堂墓地对我来说只不过是一个容纳尸体的地方，人体失去了生命，也就从美和力量的住所变成了蛆虫的食粮。现在我却要去考察人体这种腐坏的原因和过程，不得不日日夜夜待在墓穴和停尸房里。我的注意力现在集中在人类优雅感情最不堪承受的每一桩事物上。我目睹人的美好的形体是怎样衰败和腐烂的，我看到死亡后的腐败取代了青春焕发的富于生气的容颜，我眼看到蛆虫怎样盘踞着无比珍奇的人的眼睛和大脑。我驻足观察，考究和分析从生到死和从死到生的变化中所表现出来的因果关系的一切细微环节，直到在黑暗中突然迸射出一道光明，照亮了我的思想——这是一道如此辉煌和奇妙、却又是如此单纯的光明，当我被这道光明所展现的无限前景照得目眩头晕时，我不禁感到惊奇：曾经有这么多富于天才的人物向这一学科进行过探索，然而偏偏只有我一个人发现了如此惊人的秘密。

请记住，我并不是在记叙一个狂人的奇思异想。在天空照耀的太阳也不会比我所说的更真实。这件事也许只有出现某种奇迹才会发生，然而我的发现的一个个阶段却都是清清楚楚、完全可能的。经过了许多日日夜夜令人难以置信的劳作和疲惫，我才成功地发现了生殖和生命的起因。不，不仅如此，我还能够给无生命的物质赋予生命。

获得这一发现时最初体验到的惊奇，很快就为欢乐和狂喜所代替。经过了如此漫长的艰巨的劳作，突然到达自己欲望的顶峰，这正是对我的辛苦操劳的最完美的报偿。不过这个发现是如此伟大和令人惊愕，所以逐渐通向这一点的一步步过程都被淡忘了，我眼里只看到结果。从开天辟地起最有智慧的人所研究和渴望的东西，现在就在我的掌握之中。这可不像魔法里的情景，它不是猛然一下就展现在我的面前：我所获得的知识并非把已经完成了的事物展示在我面前，而只是在我确定了研究目标的时候指引我朝这个方向奋斗。我就像一个被埋葬在死人墓穴里的阿拉伯人，只是凭借着一丝微弱闪烁、似乎不可捉摸的光线，才找到一条走向生命的通道。

我从你急切的神态，以及你眼中流露出来的惊奇与希冀看出，我的朋友，你希望我告诉你我所了解的秘密是什么。耐心地听到故事结束吧，到那时你就会很容易理解我为什么对此要有所保留。我不愿意把你，像我当年那样毫无警惕而满腔热忱，引向毁灭和不可避免的不幸。从我身上汲取教训吧，即使不把我的话当作信条，至少要把我当作例证，要懂得获取知识是多么危险，而那些相信自己的家乡就是整个世界的人，比起那些渴望超越自己本性的人来，不知要幸福多少倍哩。

当我发现自己手中握有如此惊人的力量时，对于如何使用这种力量，我犹豫了很长时间。虽说我已经掌握了赋予生命的本领，然而要准备一个接受生命的躯体，包括它的繁复细微的纤维、肌肉和血管，这项工作还是面临着难以想象的困难和劳苦。起初我感到疑虑，到底是尝试创造一个像我自己一样的生命呢，还是创造一个结构较为简单的生物。但是我取得的第一次成功使我欢欣鼓舞，不容我再怀疑自己有能力将生命赋予一个像人一样复杂和奇妙的生物。我所掌握的材料看来还难以满足一项如此艰巨的事业的需要，可是我并不怀疑我最后会获得成功。我做好了准备去对付千万次的挫折，我的工作可能会不断地受挫，最终结果也可能并不完美。然而，当我想到在科学和机械学方面日新月异的进展时，我就倍受鼓舞，希望自己目前的尝试至少可以为将来的成功奠定基础。我也并不认为自己的计划因为过于庞大和复杂便是不切实际的。正是怀着这样一些想法，我开始了创造人的工作。因为人体的器官非常细微精致，这大大阻碍了我的进度，于是我决定，与起初的意图相反，我要让这个人具有庞大的体型，那就是说，大约八英尺高，全身按比例放大。在做出了这个决定以后，又花费了几个月的时间，成功地收集和整理好我的材料，然后我就开始了。

在渴望成功的最初的热情中，那旋风般的推动着我前进的复杂感情，是谁也无法想象的。生和死，对我来说乃是一种虚构出来的界限，我首先便要打破这种界限，让光明的洪流倾泻进我们这个黑暗的世界。一个新的物种将把我当作它的创造者和源头而感恩戴德，许多幸福而卓越的生命将把自己的存在归功于我的赐予。任何做父亲的，都不会像我这样完全有权利要求自己的孩子感激自己。按照这样的思路继续下去，我想，既然我能将生命赋予无生命的物质，那么随着时间的推移，我或许能（虽然我现在发现这是不可能的）在显然已经被死亡腐蚀了的躯体上复活生命。

当我以持续不懈的热情进行着我的事业时，就是这些想法在支撑着我的精神。我的脸颊因为用功而变得苍白，我的身体由于闭门不出而日渐衰弱。有时候，就在稳操胜券的当口，我失败了。然而我死死抱定希望，也许第二天，或者下一个钟头，就会成功了。对我所献身的事业充满希望，这就是我心中独自怀抱的秘密。当我半夜三更还在紧张急迫、屏息凝神地探索着自然最深处的奥秘时，唯有月亮在凝视着我。当我涉足于亵渎神明的墓穴的湿泥中，或者为了激活那毫无生命的泥土而折磨活着的动物时，谁能想象到我秘密的劳作所含的种种恐怖呢？现在想到那些情景，我的四肢便要发抖，不免头晕目眩。但在当时，却有一种不可抗拒的、几乎是疯狂的冲动驱使我往前走。要不是心里怀着这一个追求，我似乎就丧失了灵魂和任何感觉。这种感受实际上只是瞬间的心神恍惚，只要异常的刺激停止了作用，我回到惯常的状态以后，便觉得前所未有的敏锐。我从停尸房里收集骨头，我用亵渎神灵的手指去触摸人体的巨大秘密。被走廊和楼梯与其他房间分隔开来的一个单独的房间，或者说是房子顶部的一间斗室，被我当作了进行污秽的创造的工作室。因为专注于我的工作的细微操作，我的眼珠也从眼眶里鼓出来了。解剖室和屠宰场为我提供了许多材料，我身上的人性常常使我厌恶自己的工作，但是我仍然被不断增强的渴盼心理激励着，渐渐把我的工作做到接近完成。

当我这样全身心地专注于这项工作的时候，夏季的几个月过去了。这是最美丽的季节，大地从来没有赐予过人如此丰盛的收成，葡萄也从来没有生长出如此丰富的果实，可是我的眼睛对大自然的魅力却毫无感觉。这种使我无视周围景物的心境，也使我忘记了相距那么远、那么长的时间里未曾见面的亲友。我明白我的沉默会让他们不安，我也清楚地记得父亲说过的话：“我知道，你感觉愉快的时候，是会深情地想念我们的，我们将会定期收到你的来信。你应该原谅我，假如你的来信中断了，我就会据此认为你同样也忽视了在其他方面的责任。”

因此，我非常明白父亲会有怎样的心情，可是我没法让思想离开我的工作，它虽然令人厌恶，却不可抗拒地牢牢控制住了我的想象力。我似乎在这样希望，暂时把关系个人亲情的一切推延一下，等到我把那桩吞没了我天性中的所有习性的伟大事业完成以后再说。

那时我认为，父亲要是把我忽视通信看作我的罪过或者错误，那他是不公正的。可是现在我相信了，父亲觉得我并不是完全无可指责，那是有道理的。一个完美的人应当时时保持镇静和平的心态，绝不能让热情或者转瞬即逝的欲望扰乱了内心的宁静。我认为就这条原则而言，对知识的追求也并不例外。假如你所进行的研究有削弱你的感情的倾向，会破坏你对不可能掺和杂质的纯朴快乐的体味，那么，这种研究当然是不合法的，也就是说，不适宜于人类的头脑。如果始终遵守这条原则，如果谁也不允许任何事业来干扰他家庭感情的宁静的话，希腊就不会受奴役了，恺撒就不会损害他的国家了，美洲就会以和平渐进的方式被发现了，而墨西哥和秘鲁帝国也就不会被摧毁了。

不过我没注意到，我在故事最有趣的地方大谈道德教训了，你的表情在提醒我继续讲下去。

父亲在他的来信里半句也没有责备我，只是注意到了我的沉默，比过去更加详尽地询问了我做了些什么事情。冬天，春天和夏天，在我辛苦劳作的时候过去了，但我并未去观看鲜花和渐渐长大的绿叶——这些景象过去总是带给我无比的乐趣——我太深地沉浸在自己的工作中了。还没等到我的工作趋于结束的时候，当年的树叶便已枯萎，而眼前一天天愈加明白地显示出，我的事业进展得多么顺利。不过，我的热情也受到了焦虑情绪的影响，我与其说是一个从事于自己心爱的工作的艺术家，倒不如说像一个注定要在矿坑里干苦活的奴隶，或者是干任何其他有害身心的行当的人。每天夜里我都要承受一种慢性热病的折磨，我神经紧张到十分痛苦的程度：坠落一片树叶也会让我惊恐，我还躲避着我的伙伴们，仿佛自己犯了什么罪似的。有时候，我觉察到自己的惨状而感到恐慌，只有一心达到目的的动力在支撑着我。我的工作就要结束了，我相信锻炼和娱乐会驱走这些出现不久的病症，我向自己许诺，当我的创造完成以后，我既要锻炼，又要娱乐。





第五章　新生命的诞生


就在11月一个阴郁的夜晚，我看到了自己艰苦工作的成果。怀着焦急得近乎痛苦的心情，我拿起了身边的创造生命的工具，以便把生命的火花注入躺在我脚下的那个毫无生气的东西里。已经是子夜一点钟了，雨水凄厉地敲打得窗玻璃滴答作响，蜡烛也几乎燃尽了，凭借着半明半暗的莹莹烛光，我看见那个创造物睁开了浑浊呆滞的发黄的眼睛，它艰难地呼吸着，四肢开始痉挛地动弹起来。

我怎么能够描述出自己面临这一巨大灾变时的心情？或者说，我怎么能够描绘出自己备尝艰辛、殚精竭虑地创造出来的这个丑八怪？他的肢体是合乎比例的，我也曾经精心选材使它的相貌美丽。美丽！——天啊！他那黄色的皮肤几乎无法掩盖住下面的肌肉和血管，他的头发乌黑发亮，长长地飘垂着，他的牙齿白得像珍珠，可是这些鲜明的色彩和那湿漉漉的眼睛之间——那对眼睛几乎和安放它们的那暗白色的眼窝是同一种颜色，和他那皱缩的皮肤以及直挺挺的黑嘴唇之间，却恰好构成了吓人的对照。

人生中的种种偶然变故，和人性中的感情比起来还不算多么变化无常。我艰辛工作了差不多两年之久，唯一的目的是将生命力灌注到没有生命的躯体中去。为了这个目的，我剥夺了自己的休息和健康。我怀着毫无节制的热忱渴望着实现它。可是现在我完成了工作，而美丽的梦想却幻灭了，心里充满了令我窒息的恐惧和憎恶。我无法忍受自己创造出来的那个东西的模样，便冲出了工作室，回到卧室里长时间地徘徊踱步，没法安定下来睡觉。到后来疲乏终于替代了先前的烦乱，我和衣倒在床上，努力使自己能有一点忘却的时刻。然而这也是徒劳：我的确睡着了，可是狂乱的梦魇骚扰着我。我觉得自己看见了伊丽莎白，她容光焕发，正在英戈尔施塔特的街道上走着。我既高兴又惊奇，拥抱了她，可是当我在她的唇上印着第一个吻的时候，她的嘴唇却变成了死似的灰白，她的容貌似乎也改变了，我觉得自己手臂中抱着的是我死去的母亲的尸体，一块裹尸布包裹在她的身上，我看见吃死尸的蛆虫在绒布的褶皱里爬动着。我恐怖地从梦中惊醒，冷汗布满了我前额，我的牙齿打战，手脚都痉挛着。这时候月光透过百叶窗照射进来，借着它朦胧昏黄的光线，我又看见了那个丑八怪——我所创造出来的可悲的怪物。他揭起床帘，他的眼睛，如果可以叫作眼睛的话，正紧盯着我。他的嘴巴张着，喃喃地发出某种模糊不清的声音，同时皱着脸颊龇牙咧嘴地笑。他也许说了话，不过我没听见。他伸出了一只手，好像要阻拦我，但我逃掉了，急忙冲下了楼。我躲在这所房子附属的园子里，后半夜我一直留在那里，极度焦虑不安地来回走动，注意倾听着，听见一点声音就害怕是那个由我可悲地给予生命的活死尸逼近了。

啊！没有一个人能忍受他那副容貌带来的恐怖。就是一个复活了的木乃伊，也不会比这个丑八怪更骇人了。我在尚未完工的时候曾经仔细观看过他，他那时也很丑陋，可是当那些肌肉和关节一旦能够活动的时候，他就变成了一个甚至连但丁(1)也无法想象出来的怪物了。

我非常凄惨地度过了那个夜晚。有时候，我的脉搏跳动得又急又猛，以至于我感到每一根血管都在突突发颤；有时候，我又因为倦怠和极度衰弱而几乎跌倒在地上。和这种恐惧感混杂在一起，我还感到失望的苦痛。在如此长的时期里作为我的支撑和安慰的梦想，现在却变成了我的地狱。变化是多么的迅速，崩溃是何等的彻底！

阴郁而潮湿的清晨终于到来了，我通宵未眠的发痛的眼睛望见了英戈尔施塔特的教堂，看见了它那白色的尖塔和大钟，大钟正指着6点。看门人打开了我通宵当作避难所的园子的大门，于是我走进了街道，迈开急匆匆的步伐，仿佛要躲避在每个街角都可能出现在我眼前的那个丑恶的家伙。我的确曾壮起胆子想回到自己住的房间里去，可是我又觉得似乎在被什么力量推着往前走，尽管倾盆大雨从乌黑而阴郁的天空洒泼下来，湿透了我的全身。

就像这样，我继续走了一段时间，极力用体力的活动来减轻精神上的重负。我穿越过一条条街道，简直弄不清自己身在何处，或者在做什么。我的心由于满怀恐惧而发颤，我步履踉跄地急匆匆往前走，不敢向周围望上一眼——

像一个人，在冷寂的路上，

满怀恐惧地往前走，

回头看一眼，再向前，

却再也不敢回头；

因为他明白，

有个可怕的鬼正紧跟在他身后。(2)

我这样继续走，终于来到一家旅店的对面，在这旅店前面常常停着各式各样的驿车和马车。我停住了脚步，不知道是为什么，但是我在原处站了好几分钟，眼睛紧盯着从街的另一头向我驶来的一辆公共马车。当它驶近的时候，我发现那是一辆瑞士的驿车，它正好停在了我站立的地方，而且车门一打开，我竟看见了亨利·克莱瓦尔，而他一看见我便马上跳下车来。“我亲爱的弗兰肯斯坦，”他喊道，“看到你我多么高兴！我一下车，你就在这儿，是多么的幸运啊！”

没有什么能比见到克莱瓦尔更快乐的了。他的到来使我想起了我的父亲、伊丽莎白以及那所有的令我眷恋的家庭生活情景。我紧握住他的手，在一瞬间忘掉了自己的恐惧和不幸。突然地，而且是我许多个月以来第一次，我感到了平静和无忧无虑的欢乐。因此我向我的朋友表示了最衷心的欢迎，然后我们就朝我的学院走去。克莱瓦尔继续谈了一会儿有关我们共同的朋友的事，也谈到了他幸运地被准许到英戈尔施塔特来。“你完全想得到，”他说，“要说服我的父亲相信，并不是所有必要的知识都包括在崇高的簿记艺术中，该是多么的困难。而且说老实话，我担保他到最后一刻也并不相信哩，因为他对我不厌其烦的请求所给予的千篇一律的回答，老是《威克菲尔牧师传》(3)里那个荷兰教师的同一句话——‘我不懂希腊文，但我每年有一万弗罗林(4)，我不懂希腊文也吃得挺开心。’不过，他对我的爱还是最终克服了他对学问的厌弃，允许我到这个知识之邦来做一次探险旅行。”

“看到你使我感到了最大的快乐，不过请你告诉我，我的父亲、弟弟们和伊丽莎白怎么样。”

“非常的好，也非常的快乐，只是因为很少接到你的来信而感到有点不安。顺便说一下，为了他们的缘故，我本人还想责备你几句呢——不过，我亲爱的弗兰肯斯坦，”他接着说，停了片刻，仔细端详着我的脸，“我刚才没注意到，你看起来好像病得很重啊，这么消瘦和苍白，你瞧上去似乎接连几夜没睡过觉似的。”

“你猜对了。最近我一直专心致志地忙着一件工作，没法让自己得到充足的睡眠，就像你见到的这样。不过我希望，真诚地希望，所有这类工作都就此结束，我终于获得了自由。”

我全身剧烈地颤抖着，我不敢去想，更不敢提及前一天晚上发生的事情。我加快步伐向前走，于是我们很快就到了学院。这时我才想起，而这个想法使我发起抖来，那就是我留在家里的那个东西或许还在，还活生生的，走来走去。我害怕见到那个怪物，但我更害怕亨利会见到他。因此我请求他在楼下等一会儿，立即冲上楼梯到自己的房间去。我的手已经放在了门锁上了，而心里还没有镇定下来。于是我停了停，一阵冷战袭遍了我的全身。我用力把门打开，就像孩子以为门后有个鬼魂在等着的时候常做的那样，但是什么也没有出现。我胆战心惊地走进去：房间里没有人，卧室里也没有那个丑陋吓人的不速之客。我简直不敢相信这样的好运会落到自己的头上，不过，当我确证我的敌人真的已经跑掉了的时候，我高兴得直拍手，然后跑下楼去叫克莱瓦尔。

我们上楼进了房间，仆人立即送来了早餐，可是我还不能镇定住自己。控制着我的不仅仅是高兴，我由于极度的神经过敏而感到身上阵阵地刺痛，脉搏也在剧烈地跳动。我不能在同一个地方安定一秒钟，我跳过一把又一把椅子，拍着手，大声地笑。克莱瓦尔起初以为我异乎寻常的兴奋是因他到来而高兴，不过当他更留意地观察了我之后，他看出在我的眼神里有一种他无法解释的狂乱，我那高声的、放纵的、毫无感情的大笑使他既害怕又吃惊。

“我亲爱的维克多，”他叫道，“看在上帝分上，这是怎么回事啊？别再这样笑了。你病得多重啊！这到底是什么原因？”

“不要问我，”我喊道，用手蒙住了眼睛，因为我觉得我看到了那个恐怖的妖怪悄悄溜进了房间，“‘他’能告诉你——啊，救救我！救救我！”我想象怪物抓住了我，我发疯似的挣扎，然后猛然昏倒在地上。

可怜的克莱瓦尔！他会有怎样的感觉？他怀着那么快乐的心情期盼着的会面，竟会如此奇怪地变成了一种苦涩。可是我并没有目睹他的痛苦，因为我已经人事不省了，很长很长时间里我都没能恢复知觉。

一种神经性的热病就此开始，它使得我在几个月时间里卧床不起。在那些日子里，亨利是我唯一的看护。后来我才明白，亨利知道我父亲年纪太大，不宜做这样的长途旅行，而我的病又会使伊丽莎白伤心，所以他向他们隐瞒了我的病情，以免他们痛苦。他也知道，对我来说再没有比他自己更和蔼、更细心的看护了。他坚信我会康复，所以他一点也不怀疑自己这样做非但不是坏事，反而是对他们做了力所能及的最好的事情。

但我确实是病得非常重，只是因为我的朋友的无微不至和毫不懈怠的照料，才挽救了我的生命。我所创造的那个妖魔的形象一直浮现在我眼前，在我乱七八糟的呓语中也不断地提到他。我的话无疑使得亨利吃惊：他起初相信那是我受到扰乱的想象力在胡思乱想，可是我老是重复不断地谈同一件事，这使得他不得不考虑，我的神志错乱一定起因于某种异乎寻常的可怕事件。

我终于好起来了，不过恢复得非常缓慢，而且频繁发作的病情反复也让我的朋友惊恐和痛苦。我还记得自己第一次能够以愉快的心情观看外部事物时的情景，我看到落叶已经不见了，遮掩着我的窗户的树木已经发出了嫩芽。那是一个奇妙的春天，这个季节对我的康复大有裨益。我觉得自己的心中，欢乐和爱的感情在复苏，我的忧郁消失了，没过多久，我就变得和过去未被致命的激情袭击之前同样地振奋了。

“最亲爱的克莱瓦尔，”我感叹道，“你对我是多么友爱，多么好。这整整一个冬天，你没能像你打算的那样埋头钻研，却完全消磨在我的病室里。我怎么才能报偿你呢？我严厉自责，因为我的缘故而让你失望，不过你是会原谅我的。”

“只要你不再烦恼不安，尽快地恢复健康，你就完全报偿我了。既然你现在情绪很好，我想我可以给跟你谈一件事情，行吗？”

我发抖了。谈一件事情！那会是什么？他会提到我简直想也不敢想的那个东西吗？

“请你放心，”克莱瓦尔看见我变了脸色，便说，“要是这会使你不安，我就不提它了。不过，如果你的父亲和表妹收到一封你的亲笔信的话，他们会非常高兴的。他们还不知道你病得多么严重，你长时间的沉默一定使他们担心了。”

“就是这事吗，我亲爱的亨利？你怎么会觉得我的心思不会首先飞向那些我所爱的、而且是那么值得我爱的亲人们呢？”

“如果这就是你现在的心情，我的朋友，那么你或许会很高兴读一读在这儿搁了几天的一封信。我相信它是你的表妹写给你的。”

第六章　亲情和友谊


于是克莱瓦尔把下面这封信放到了我的手中。它是我的伊丽莎白写来的——

我最亲爱的表哥——你病了，病情很重，即使亲爱的好亨利不断地写信来，也不能使我对你放心。你被医生禁止写信——禁止握笔，不过即使你的只言片语，亲爱的维克多，对平息我们的挂虑也是必要的。很长时间以来，我总以为每一班邮车会带来你的一封短信，我也一直劝阻叔叔启程到英戈尔施塔特来。我要避免他在这样漫长的旅途中经受种种不便甚至危险，可是我又那样时时遗憾自己不能亲自这样做！我在心中想象，在病床前照料你的任务，竟交给了一个只想赚钱的老看护，她绝不会猜想到你的愿望，也不会以你可怜的表妹的细心和真情来照看你。不过这一切已经过去了，克莱瓦尔写信来告诉我们，你确实一天天在康复。我热切地希望，你很快就会用你的亲笔信来证实这个消息。

愿你恢复健康——然后回到我们身边。你会有一个幸福而欢乐的家，有真心爱你的亲人。你的父亲身体康健，他一心只想见到你——确证你已经完全恢复，这样他那慈祥的面容上就不会有一缕愁云了。看到我们的欧内斯特大有长进，你会多么高兴啊！他现在十六岁了，充满了朝气和活力。他渴望成为一个真正的瑞士人，到国外去服役，不过我们不能和他分手，至少要等到他哥哥回到我们身边才行。叔叔对他想到遥远的国家从事军事生涯并不乐意，可是欧内斯特绝没有你那种专注用功的毅力。他把学习看作令人讨厌的枷锁——他的光阴都消耗在了野外，不是爬山，就是划船。我担心他会变成一个游手好闲的人，除非我们让步，同意他去从事他自己选择的职业。

自从你离开我们之后，除了我们可爱的弟弟们在长大以外，一切都没有多大改变。蔚蓝的湖水，皑皑的雪山，它们都永远不变。我想，我们安宁的家和我们满足的心也是被同样不变的规律所支配的。我那些琐碎的事务占据了我的时间，也让我得到了乐趣，看到周围的人都露出快乐和亲切的笑脸，我努力做的任何事情就得到了回报。你离家以后，我们小小的家庭里只有一个变化。你还记得于斯丁·莫里兹是怎样进入我们家的吗？也许你记不起了，所以我要用几句话讲讲她的故事。她的母亲莫里兹太太是个拖着四个孩子的寡妇，于斯丁是她的第三个孩子。这个女孩一直最得她父亲的宠爱，可是她的母亲出于一种奇怪的反常心理，却不能容忍她，在莫里兹先生去世以后待她很坏。我婶婶注意到了这种情况，在于斯丁十二岁的时候，说服她的母亲让她住到了我们家。由于我们国家的共和制度，人们的生活方式比周围那些君主制大国更为纯朴和快乐。所以，不同阶层的居民们之间的差别不是那样显著，较低阶层的人既不像其他国家的贫民那样穷困，也不是那样被人看不起，他们的生活方式也更加文雅，更有道德。一个日内瓦的仆人，和一个法国或英国的仆人绝不是一回事。于斯丁就这样被我们的家庭接纳，学习一个仆人的职责。这种地位在我们这个幸运的国家里，并不意味着无知愚昧，或者是牺牲了个人的尊严。

你也许还记得，于斯丁是你非常喜欢的人。我还记得你有一次说，如果你心情不好，只要于斯丁看你一眼，你的烦恼就会消散，而理由则和阿里奥斯托谈到安杰丽嘉的美丽时是一样的(1)——她看起来是那样心地坦率和快乐。婶婶对她很有感情，所以让她受的教育比最初打算的要更优越。这一恩惠获得了充分的报偿，于斯丁是世界上最知恩图报的孩子了，我倒不是说她有什么口头的表白，我从来没有听见她说过半个字，可是你能从她的眼神里看出，她几乎崇拜着她的女恩人。尽管她性格活泼，在许多方面还有欠细致周到，可是她对婶婶的一举一动却极为留心。她把婶婶当作尽善尽美的典范，努力模仿她的言谈举止，以至于直到现在于斯丁还常常让我想起婶婶来。

在亲爱的婶婶去世的时候，大家都过于沉浸在自己的悲痛之中，所以没怎么注意可怜的于斯丁，而于斯丁在婶婶病中一直满怀忧虑地以爱心照料着她。可怜的于斯丁患了重病，可是还有更多的磨难在等待着她。

她的兄弟姐妹一个接一个死去了，她的母亲除了这个被她忽视的女儿之外，就没有任何子女了。这个女人的良心感到了不安，她开始考虑，受她宠爱的孩子去世乃是上天对她偏心的惩罚。她是个罗马天主教徒，我相信，听她忏悔的神父也使她坚信了自己的想法。所以，在你去了英戈尔施塔特之后几个月，于斯丁就被她那悔悟了的母亲领回去了。可怜的姑娘！她离开我们家的时候哭了。自从婶婶去世以后，她变了许多，悲伤使得她过去活泼欢快的性格变得温和而柔顺了。住在母亲的家里也难以使她重新快乐起来。那个可怜的女人在悔恨的心境中变得情绪波动，有时候她哀求于斯丁宽恕她的冷酷无情，但更多的时候是把子女的死怪罪到于斯丁身上。长期的烦躁终于使得莫里兹太太身体衰竭了，起初她越来越暴躁易怒，而现在她则永远安息了。她是在寒潮第一次侵袭的时候去世的。于斯丁又回到我们这里了。说真的，我很疼爱她。她很聪明很温柔，而且非常漂亮，正像我前面说过的，她的神态和表情一直使我想起我亲爱的婶婶。

我亲爱的表哥，我还得说几句有关心爱的小威廉的话。我真希望你能见到他。就他的年龄而言，他的个子是挺高的，长着一双充满甜美笑意的蓝眼睛，黑色的睫毛，卷曲的头发。他的脸颊泛着健康的红晕，微笑的时候便出现两个小酒窝。他已经有一两个小“妻子”了，不过路易莎·毕伦是他最喜欢的，那是一个五岁的漂亮小姑娘。

现在，亲爱的维克多，我敢说你一定希望听听有关日内瓦的那些好人们的闲言碎语吧。漂亮的曼斯菲尔小姐即将和一个年轻的英国人约翰·梅尔本先生结婚，已经接待了很多祝贺的客人。她的丑姐姐曼侬去年秋天嫁给了一个富有的银行家杜维亚先生。你的要好的同学路易·马努瓦，在克莱瓦尔离开日内瓦以后碰到了好几件倒霉事。不过他已经恢复了情绪，据说就要娶一位非常活泼漂亮的法国女人塔弗尼尔夫人了。她是个寡妇，而且比马努瓦要大得多，但是她很受人们崇拜，每个人都喜欢她。

我越写心情就越好，亲爱的表哥，可是当我要结束的时候，忧虑又重回心头。写信吧，最亲爱的维克多——哪怕一行——哪怕一个字，都将使我们快乐。万分感激亨利的好心，他的爱意，以及他写的那么多封信，我们真诚地感谢他。再见！我的表哥，保重自己。再有，我请求你，写信来！

伊丽莎白·拉文查

17××年3月18日，日内瓦

“亲爱的，亲爱的伊丽莎白！”我念完她的来信后叫道，“我马上就写信，以免他们心里焦虑。”我写了信，而这件费力的工作竟使我疲惫不堪。不过我已经开始康复了，恢复的情况很正常。两个礼拜以后，我就能够离寓所外出了。

我身体复原之后首先要做的一件事，就是把克莱瓦尔介绍给大学里的几位教授。做这件事使我经受了某种折磨，对我精神上所受的创伤很不适宜。就从那个结束了工作、开始了不幸的致命的夜晚起，我甚至对自然哲学这个名称也感到强烈的反感。尽管我的健康已经恢复到相当程度，可是一旦见到化学仪器，神经性症状的一切痛苦便会再度发作。亨利看出了这一点，把我所有的仪器都从我的眼前搬走了。他还让我迁了住所，因为他发觉我对过去当作实验室的那个房间很讨厌。但是当我去拜访那些教授的时候，克莱瓦尔的这些关心就完全无济于事了。沃德曼先生仁慈而热情地夸奖我在科学上取得了惊人的进步，那简直是在折磨我。他很快就发现了我不喜欢这个话题，但他猜不到真正的原因，便把我的感情归结为谦虚，并把话题从我的进步转到了科学本身上来，正如我明白看出的那样，他是想引我谈话。可是我能怎么办呢？他的用意是要让我高兴，然而他却在折磨我。我感到他仿佛细心地把一件件刑具展示在我眼前，这些刑具是以后用来慢慢地、残酷地把我处死的。他的话语使我剧痛，可是我却不敢表示出自己的痛苦。克莱瓦尔的眼睛和感觉总是能很快地觉察到别人的感情，他便借口自己在这方面完全无知，推开了这个话题，于是谈话也就转到一般的问题上去了。我从内心感激我的朋友，不过我没有说出来。我清楚地看出他感到很惊奇，可是他从来就不会试图让我吐露心里的秘密。而我虽然怀着敬慕和尊重相互交织的感情爱着他，但仍然没法说服自己把这件时常浮现于记忆中的事向他坦露，我害怕把详情讲给另一个人听只会更加深它在我心头的印象。

克伦普先生并不是同样的温和。我当时处在几乎是不堪承受的敏感状况下，所以他那刺耳的、毫不掩饰的颂扬比沃德曼先生好意的称赞更使我痛苦。“真是活见鬼！”他嚷道，“嗨，克莱瓦尔先生，我敢说他已经胜过了我们大家。嗬，你尽管不相信好了，不过这是真的。一个年轻人，几年前还像信奉福音书一样坚定地信奉科讷利乌斯·阿格里帕，现在可是大学里的拔尖人物了，要是不快些把他拉下来的话，我们大家都要丢脸啦——唉，唉，”他看见我脸上露出痛苦的表情，又接着说，“弗兰肯斯坦先生很谦逊，这在一个年轻人身上是一种美好的品德。年轻人对自己的估价应该低一些才好，你知道，克莱瓦尔先生，我在年轻的时候就是这样，不过这种品德很快就会被消磨掉的。”

克伦普先生现在开始吹嘘起自己来，而这正好愉快地使谈话从令我烦恼的话题转移开了。

克莱瓦尔对我在自然科学方面的兴趣从来没有产生过共鸣，他对文学的追求与我所从事的研究完全不同。他到大学来，怀着使自己成为精通东方语言的大师的打算，希望借此为自己确定的人生计划开辟出一个领域。他决心要追求光荣的事业，便把目光投向东方，认为这可以为他的进取精神提供施展的天地。波斯语、阿拉伯语、梵语吸引了他的注意力，而我也很容易地被引向了同样的学习内容。无所事事的生活素来是我厌恶的，现在既然我希望摆脱自己的忧思，而且憎恶我过去的研究，所以和我的朋友共同学习使我感到极大的解脱，同时我在东方学者的著作中不仅获得了教益，也得到了安慰。我和克莱瓦尔不同，我并不试图对东方的各种语系获得一种批判性的知识，因为我除了暂时消遣而外没有别的用意。我的阅读只求理解其中蕴含的意义，而我的劳动得到了报偿。东方作家们的忧郁情调对人有抚慰作用，他们的欢乐则能振奋精神，其感人的程度是我在研读其他国家的作家时所从未体验过的。在你阅读东方作家的著作时，生活仿佛就是温煦的太阳和玫瑰园——仿佛就是一个爱而不得的女子的笑靥蹙眉，那团火焰简直要烧毁你的心。这与希腊和罗马的勇武的英雄诗歌是多么的不同！

夏季便在这样的学习中度过了，而我返回日内瓦的行期定在了秋末，可是因为几件意外的事故耽误，冬季和雪天又来临了，道路阻塞难行，我的行期又被推延到次年春季。这样的耽误使我很痛苦，因为我渴望着见到我的故乡和我心爱的亲友。我回家的日子所以被延误这么久，只是因为不愿意在克莱瓦尔与当地人熟识之前把他单独撇在陌生的地方。不过这个冬天倒是过得很快乐，而且虽然春天比通常时候来得晚，可是当它来临的时候，美丽的景色已足以补偿它的姗姗来迟了。

5月已经开始了，我每天都在盼着来信，以便确定我动身的日子，这时亨利建议到英戈尔施塔特的周围去做一次徒步旅行，也算我向自己住过这么久的国家做个人的告别。对这个建议我欣然赞同，我本来就喜欢体育锻炼，过去常在祖国的山川风光中进行这类性质的漫游时，克莱瓦尔总是我最好的伴侣。

我们在漫游中度过了两个礼拜，我的身体和精神都早已恢复了，而我所呼吸的宜人的空气，我们旅行途中所接触到的自然界的种种见闻，以及和我的朋友的谈话，更使我的身心获得了新的力量。以前，我的研究曾使得我和伙伴们疏于交往，让我变得很不合群，可是克莱瓦尔唤回了我心中的美好感情，他重新教会了我去爱大自然的景物，爱儿童欢乐的笑脸。多好的朋友！他多么诚挚地爱着我，又是多么真诚地极力要提高我的精神境界，直到它能达到与他相同的高度！一种自私的追求一直在束缚和限制着我，直到他的慷慨和爱心温暖了我，开阔了我心胸，我又重新变成了几年前那个幸福的人，爱所有的人，也被所有的人爱，再也没有任何苦恼和忧虑。心情一愉快，没有生命的自然界也就显示出了赋予我最大欢乐的力量。静谧的天空和青翠的田野使我心旷神怡。现在这个季节真是奇妙，春天的鲜花在树篱间盛开，夏季的花朵也在含苞欲放。前一年折磨我的思想现在已不再来骚扰我了，过去我尽管竭力要摆脱它们，它们仍然以不可抵御的力量重压着我。

亨利因为我的欢乐而感到高兴，并且真诚地和我的感情交融共鸣。他一方面表达着充满自己心灵的种种感受，另一方面也努力让我愉快起来。每当这个时候，他的智能真是令人惊叹，他的谈话充满了想象力，他常常模仿波斯和阿拉伯作家的风格，虚构出富于神奇幻想和激情的故事。有时候，他又背诵我最喜欢的诗，或者引我争论一些问题，而他支持自己的观点时总是极富独创性。

我们在一个礼拜天的下午回到了学院，农民们正在跳舞，我们遇见的每个人都显得喜气扬扬。我自己也兴高采烈，满怀欢乐地蹦跳着往前走。

第七章　灾祸初起


回到房间，我看到了父亲写来的这封信——

我亲爱的维克多——你或许已经不耐烦地等待着一封确定你回家日期的信吧。我最初很想只写上几行，只是提一提我希望在哪一天能见到你而已。可是那将是一种残酷的仁慈，我不敢这样做。当你期望着受到愉快和欢乐的迎接的时候，却相反看到眼泪和悲惨，我的儿子，你将震惊到何等程度呢？而我，维克多，又怎样来叙述我的不幸呢？分离并不能使你对我们的欢乐和悲伤麻木不仁，我又怎么能给我长期远离的儿子增加痛苦？我希望让你对这个悲惨的消息预先有所准备，可是我又明白这是不可能的，即使现在你的目光扫过这页信纸，寻找将要给你带来噩耗的字句时，也不可能先有准备。

威廉死了！——那个可爱的孩子，他的笑容曾经使我的心欢乐而温暖，他是那么的温顺，那么的快活！维克多，他是被人杀死的！

我不愿试图来安慰你，我只想简单地讲一讲事情的经过：

上个礼拜四（5月7日），我，我的侄女，还有你的两个弟弟，到普兰帕莱去散步。傍晚时分天气温暖而晴朗，我们比平时走得远一些。等我们想到返回的时候，天已经快黑了；那时我们发现走在前面的威廉和欧内斯特不见了。因此我们就坐下来休息，等他们回来。欧内斯特很快回来了，并问我们是否见到了他的弟弟。他说，他一直在和威廉一起玩，后来威廉跑到一边去藏了起来，他四处找也找不到，随后又等了他很久，但他始终没有回来。

他的述说使我们很惊恐，于是我们就继续寻找他，直到夜幕降临，这时候伊丽莎白猜想他也许已经回了家。但他并不在家。我们又回头再找，还带着火把，因为我一想到可爱的孩子迷了路，在夜晚的潮气和露水里毫无掩蔽，就没法安心，伊丽莎白也是焦急到了极点。大约到清晨五点，我找到了心爱的孩子，头天晚上见到他时还是那么活泼健康，现在却脸色青黑、一动不动地瘫卧在草地上：他的脖子上还留着凶手的指印。

他被抬回了家，我脸上显而易见的痛苦表情向伊丽莎白暴露了秘密。她非常想见一见尸体。我一开始试图阻拦她，但她坚持要看，闯进了停放尸体的房间，急匆匆地查验了受害孩子的脖子，然后紧握着双手高喊道：“啊，上帝啊！是我害死了我亲爱的小男孩！”

她昏过去了，我们费了极大的劲才使她恢复了知觉。当她醒过来以后，只是一味地哭泣和叹气。她告诉我，那天傍晚威廉曾缠着她，要戴她项上挂着的那个你母亲的非常珍贵的小肖像。肖像现在不见了，无疑就是这副肖像的诱惑驱使凶手干下了这桩事。我们目前还没有发现有关凶手的任何线索，不过我们要找到他的努力是绝不会停息的，然而怎么做也不会使我心爱的威廉死而复生了！

回来吧，亲爱的维克多；只有你才能安慰伊丽莎白。她现在不停地哭泣，并且毫无道理地责备自己导致了威廉的死亡；她的话简直刺穿了我的心。我们都很伤心，我的儿子，难道这不会更促使你回来安慰我们大家吗？你亲爱的母亲！唉，维克多！我现在要说，感谢上帝，她没有活着目睹她心爱的小儿子惨不忍睹地死去！

回来吧，维克多，不要抱着向凶手复仇的想法，而要怀着平和温柔的感情，这样才能疗治我们心头的创伤，而不会使它们更加恶化。我的好孩子，怀着仁慈和对爱你的人们的情意，不要带着对敌人的仇恨，走进这哀伤之家吧。

你亲爱的、伤心的父亲，阿尔丰斯·弗兰肯斯坦

17××年5月12日，日内瓦

克莱瓦尔在我读信的时候一直注意着我的神情，他吃惊地观察到，我由开始接到亲人的消息时的欢乐转变为了绝望。我把信扔到桌子上，用双手捂住了脸。

“我亲爱的弗兰肯斯坦，”他察觉到我在痛苦地哭泣，便高声说道，“难道你总是要不快乐才好吗？我亲爱的朋友，发生什么事了？”

我示意他拿起那封信，自己则极其烦乱地在房间里走来走去。当他读到我不幸的消息时，眼泪不禁夺眶而出。

“我没法安慰你，我的朋友，”他说，“你的灾难是无法弥补的。你打算怎么办？”

“即刻回日内瓦，亨利，跟我一道去找马车。”

在路上，克莱瓦尔努力要说几句话来安慰我，可是他只能表达他由衷的同情。“可怜的威廉！”他说，“可爱的讨人喜欢的孩子，现在他和他那天使般的母亲安息在一起了！谁见过这个年幼而美丽的孩子那聪明快乐的模样，都一定会为他的夭折而流泪的！死得那样的惨，竟被凶手给掐死了！要多么残忍的凶手才忍心摧残这样富于童年生气的无辜的孩子！可怜的小家伙！我们只有一个安慰，他的亲人们在为他哀悼和哭泣，然而他却已安息。那阵剧痛结束了，他的苦难永远终止了。一片草泥覆盖了他美好的躯体，他从此便再没有任何痛苦。他不再是怜悯的对象了，我们应该把怜悯留给仍然活着的可怜的人们。”

我们匆匆走过大街小巷的时候，克莱瓦尔这样说着。这些话深深地印在我的脑海里，后来我在孤独寂寞时又想起它们来。不过在当时，马车一到我就急忙上了车，向我的朋友告别了。

我的旅途是十分阴郁的。一开始，我盼望快快赶路，因为我渴望安慰我亲爱的哀伤的亲人们，和他们分担痛苦，可是当我渐渐接近故乡的时候，又减慢了速度。我几乎承受不了涌入心头的那许多复杂的感情。我一路上看见了青年时代所熟悉的种种景物，而我差不多有六年光景没有再见到它们了。在这段时光里，发生了多么大的变化啊！一件突如其来的灾难性的事变发生了，可是还有上千种细微的事件可能渐渐地导致其他许多改变，尽管它们是悄无声息地进行着，却不会减轻其决定性作用。恐惧压倒了我，我不敢再往前走，我惧怕着千百种使我战栗的不可名状的灾祸，虽然我没法说清楚它们是什么。

在这种痛苦的心态下，我在洛桑滞留了两天。我凝视着湖面，湖水波澜不兴，周围一片宁静，皑皑雪山，那“大自然的宫殿”，丝毫没有改变。静谧的如仙境般美丽的景色渐渐使我恢复了平静，于是我又继续着回日内瓦的旅程。

道路沿着湖边伸延着，越是接近故乡，道路越窄。我更加清晰地看见了尤拉山的坡脊，还有璀璨的勃朗峰。我像一个小孩子似的哭起来。“亲爱的山啊！我的美丽的湖啊！你们怎样来欢迎这个游子呢？你们的峰峦明净清晰，天穹和湖水碧蓝而宁静。这是在预示着和平呢，还是在嘲弄着我的不幸？”

我的朋友啊，我担心这样细细诉说到家前的种种情况，会使自己变得令人生厌了，可是那些日子还算是相对幸福的，现在我还怀着愉快的心情想念着它们。我的祖国，我亲爱的祖国！除了本国的同胞，还有谁能说得出我在重睹你的溪流、你的山峦，尤其是你可爱的湖水时心里的欢乐呢？

然而，当我越来越接近家门的时候，忧伤和恐惧又再度压倒了我。周围夜色沉沉，当我难以看清那黑黝黝的群山时，便更觉心情阴郁。眼前好像是一幅昭示着灾祸的广袤而黯淡的图景，而我则朦胧地预见到自己命中注定要成为最不幸的人。唉！我的预见是正确的，只是在一点上不准确，那就是尽管我想象和惧怕着种种苦难，也没能设想出我注定将承受的痛苦的百分之一。

当我抵达日内瓦附近地区的时候，天已经黑尽了，城门已经关闭了，我不得不在色歇隆度过当夜，这是离城半里格(1)的一个村子。天空很宁静。我因为不能入睡，便决定去看一看可怜的威廉被杀害的那个地方。由于无法从城中穿过，我只好坐小船渡过湖泊去普兰帕莱了。就在这短短的航途中，我看到了闪电在勃朗峰顶飞舞时那美丽之极的景象。当时暴风雨似乎在迅速地逼近，我登上了湖岸，爬上了一座小山，这样我就可以观察到暴风雨的发展过程。它在往前行进，天空乌云密布，不久我就感觉到大滴的雨点慢慢落了下来，而风暴的威力正在迅疾地增长着。

我离开坐处，继续往前走，尽管黑暗每分钟都变得更浓重，风暴变得更强劲，惊雷在我头上以可怕的轰鸣炸响。雷声在萨拉维、尤拉山和萨瓦的阿尔卑斯山那一带引起了回响。跳跃闪烁的电光晃得我眼花缭乱，它把湖面照得雪亮，使湖水看起来就像一片宽阔无边的燃烧的火海，接着在瞬刻之间，一切又变为漆黑，直到我的眼睛从方才的闪光中恢复视力为止。就像时常在瑞士发生的情况那样，暴风雨总是在天空的各个部分同时出现。最猛烈的风暴在城市的正北方，处于贝尔里芙海角和科佩村之间的那部分湖面上。另一场风暴正以微弱的闪电照亮着尤拉山，还有一场风暴则在湖东高耸的摩尔山上酝酿着，它将山峰笼罩在黑雾中，间或又让山峰显露出来。

我一面观看着如此美丽却又如此可怕的暴风雨，一面疾速地往前走。天空中那场壮丽的大自然的战争使我精神激奋，我紧握着双手，高声喊道：“威廉，可爱的小天使！这就是你的葬礼，这就是你的挽歌！”正在我说这些话的时候，我察觉到在阴暗处有一个身影，正从附近的树丛背后偷偷地溜出来。我伫立不动，凝神观看，我绝不会弄错。一道电光照亮了那个物体，向我清楚地显现了它的形状。它那庞大的体型，畸形的相貌，非人的丑陋，瞬刻之间就告诉了我，这就是我赐予生命的那个怪物，那个肮脏的魔鬼。他在这里干什么？他会不会是（我想到这一点就不寒而栗）杀害我弟弟的凶手？这个念头刚一掠过我的脑际，我就对它确信无疑。我的牙齿颤抖得格格作响，我被迫靠在一棵树上支撑着自己。那个身影迅速地从我面前掠过，在黑暗之中隐没了。只要还算具有人的躯壳的任何东西，也不至于去毁灭那个可爱的孩子啊。他就是那个凶手！我绝不怀疑这一点。单凭这个念头出现在我的脑际，就不可辩驳地证明了这是事实。我想到过跟踪这个魔鬼，但那将是徒劳无益的，因为又一道闪电掠过，我发现他正攀缘在与普兰帕莱南边相邻的几乎是垂直的萨拉维山的悬崖上。他很快地爬到了山顶，接着就消失了。

我待在原地一动也不动。雷声停了，不过雨还在下，周围全被一片无法穿透的黑暗包裹着。我的脑海里历历展现着我迄今一直努力要忘却的种种事件：我创造生命所经历的一系列过程；我的亲手创造物活生生地出现在我床前；他的不辞而别。从他最初获得生命的那个夜晚算起，差不多有两年时间过去了。这是不是他犯下的第一个罪行？唉！我竟然放纵一个以残害生命和制造不幸为乐事的、堕落的怪物到这世界上来。难道不是他杀害了我的弟弟吗？

没有谁能想象到我在露天度过的又冷又湿的后半夜里，我内心所承受的剧痛。我丝毫没有感觉到气候的恶劣，我的想象中疾速地掠过罪恶和绝望的景象。我在想着我释放到人间来的这个生物，是我赋予他意志和力量来实行恐怖的目的，例如现在他干下的这种行径，而这简直就等于我自己是一个吸血鬼，是从坟墓中释放出我自己的鬼魂，迫使它去毁灭我的所有亲人。

天亮了，于是我迈步走向城里。城门已经打开，我急忙朝父亲的房子走去。我一开始想到的是披露我所知道的有关凶手的情况，这样可以让人们立即进行追捕。但当我考虑到自己将不得不讲出那个故事，便只好作罢了。我自己制造了一个东西，我还赋予它生命，我还在半夜三更的时候、在险峻高山的悬崖上碰见了它。除了这完全不能令人置信而外，我也想起了在我的创造物出世的时候，自己曾经患过神经性热病，所以在讲述这个故事时更会显得像发高热时的胡言乱语。我很清楚，假如别的任何人向我讲述类似的事情，我也会把它视为精神错乱的疯话。此外，即使是亲友们信任我，被我说服去抓捕它，那个怪物的奇异的特性也是能够使它逃脱的。那么，跟踪追捕又有什么用呢？谁能够逮住有本领爬上萨拉维山的悬崖峭壁的怪物呢？这番考虑使我拿定了主意，决定保持沉默。

大约在清晨五点，我走进了父亲的房子。我告诉仆人别打搅家里人，然后走进书房去等候他们在通常的时间起床。

六年时光过去了，除了一道无法抹去的痕迹以外，这六年就像是一场梦，现在我又站在离家去英戈尔施塔特之前最后一次拥抱父亲的同一个地方了。亲爱的、可敬的父亲！他仍然在我身边。我凝视着立在壁炉上的母亲的肖像。这是按照父亲的意愿绘制的纪念性的主题画，画着卡罗琳·波福怀着绝望的痛苦跪在她父亲的灵柩旁。她的服装朴素，她的脸颊苍白，可是她有一种尊严而美丽的神态，不容人产生怜悯的感情。在这幅画像下面是一幅威廉的小画像，当我看到它时，不由得泪流满面。就在这时候，欧内斯特进来了，他听说我到家了，就急忙来迎接我。他见到我时显示出一种含着哀伤的快乐。“欢迎你，我最亲爱的维克多，”他说，“啊！我真希望你在三个月前回来，那时你会看到我们全都愉快而欢乐！现在你回来是要和我们分担无法减轻的悲痛了。不过我希望有你在家可以使父亲振作起来，他似乎正在不幸的重压下消沉下去；你的劝解也将使可怜的伊丽莎白停止她那毫无补益的痛苦的自责——可怜的威廉！他是我们的宝贝和我们的骄傲！”

无法自制的泪水从我弟弟的眼中流下来，致命的剧痛袭遍了我的全身。以前，我所想象的只是我这凄凉之家的悲惨情景，而现实对于我来说却是一场新的、同样可怕的灾祸。我极力让欧内斯特安静下来，我更仔细地询问有关父亲和我称为表妹的她的情况。

“她是我们当中最需要安慰的人，”欧内斯特说，“她指责自己是导致弟弟死亡的原因，这使得她非常痛苦。不过自从凶手被发现以后——”

“凶手被发现了！天啊！那怎么可能？谁能试图追上他？这是不可能的事——倒不如去追赶风，或者用一根草去挡住山溪。我也见到了他，他昨晚还没被抓住！”

“我不明白你的意思，”弟弟回答说，声音很惊讶，“不过发现了凶手却使我们更加彻底的不幸了。起初谁也不相信，现在尽管有了充分的证据，伊丽莎白仍然还是不相信。的确，谁能相信于斯丁·莫里兹，那样的和气，那样的爱我们全家，在突然间竟可能犯下如此可怕、如此令人震惊的罪行呢？”

“于斯丁·莫里兹！可怜的、可怜的姑娘，她被指控了吗？不过这是冤枉的，谁都知道这一点，谁也不相信，的确不相信，对吧，欧内斯特？”

“一开始谁也不相信，可是发现了一些情况，几乎迫使我们不得不信，而且她本人的举止又是如此惊慌，这就使得证据更加确凿，我担心事情已经是无可怀疑的了。不过她今天就要受审判，到那时你就可以听到所有的情况。”

他说，在发现可怜的威廉被害的那天早晨，于斯丁病了，而且有好几天都卧床不起。在这段时间里，一个仆人偶尔翻检她在凶杀发生的当晚穿过的衣服，在她的衣服口袋里发现了我母亲的肖像，这幅肖像被判定为诱使凶手杀人的东西。仆人即刻把它给另一个仆人看了，后者没有给家里任何人说半个字，便径直去见了地方行政官，根据他们的做证，于斯丁被关押起来。在依据事实受到指控的情况下，可怜的姑娘又表现得极其惊慌，于是在很大程度上更加证实了人们的怀疑。

这真是一个奇怪的故事，不过它并没有动摇我的信念，于是我诚挚地回答道：“你们都弄错了，我知道谁是凶手。于斯丁，可怜的、善良的于斯丁，是无辜的。”

就在这时候，父亲进来了。我看到愁容深深地印在他的脸上，但他努力要高高兴兴地欢迎我。在我们相互致以哀伤的问候以后，本来可以不谈我们的灾难而转向其他的话题，可是欧内斯特却大声地说：“天哪，爸爸！维克多说他知道谁是杀死可怜的威廉的凶手。”

“我们也知道了，这很不幸，”父亲回答道，“因为说真的，我宁愿永远被蒙在鼓里，也不愿在我如此珍爱的人身上发现这样深重的堕落和忘恩负义。”

“我亲爱的父亲，你错了，于斯丁是无辜的。”

“如果她是无辜的，上帝便不会让她蒙受罪名。今天她就要受审判了，我希望，我真诚地希望，她会被无罪开释。”

这番话使我平静下来。我坚信不仅于斯丁，而且任何人在这桩罪行中都是无辜的。因此，我丝毫也不担心会有任何偶然的证据足以证实她的罪名。我的故事不能当众宣布，其骇人听闻的程度会使一般人视为疯子的胡言乱语。除了我这个创造者以外，除非亲眼看见，谁会相信世界上存在着这个代表我自己的狂妄无知、并由我释放到人世上来作恶的活生生的创造物呢？

伊丽莎白很快就来到我们中间。自从我最后见到她以来，时光已使她有了改变，它赋予了她远远超越了童年时代之美的一种妩媚。她依然具有那种爽朗，那种活泼，但又糅合进了一种更富于情感和智慧的神态。她怀着强烈的感情欢迎我。“亲爱的表哥，你的到来，”她说，“使我充满了希望。也许你会找出什么办法来证明我可怜的于斯丁是无罪的。唉！假如连她都被认为有罪，那么谁还是安全的呢？我相信她的清白，就像我相信自己的清白一样确凿无疑。厄运给了我们双倍的打击，我们不仅失去了可爱的男孩，这个我所挚爱的可怜的姑娘又将被更可怕的命运夺走。如果她被定了罪，我将再也没有欢乐了。可是她不会被定罪的，我敢肯定不会。这样，即使是在我的小威廉惨死之后，我还可以再度快乐起来。”

“她是清白的，我的伊丽莎白，”我说，“这将得到证明，一点也别担心，坚信她会被无罪开释，让你的情绪振奋起来吧。”

“你是多么仁慈和宽宏大量啊！别的人个个都相信她有罪，这使我伤心，因为我知道那是绝不可能的。看到别人如此顽固地抱着偏见，我丧失了希望，毫无信心了。”她哭着说。

“亲爱的侄女，”父亲说，“擦干你的眼泪吧。如果她像你所相信的那样是无辜的，那么就信任我们法律的公正，并相信我会用行动去制止哪怕是最微小的有失公正的事情。”

第八章　又一个牺牲者


我们度过了惨淡的几个钟头，直到十一点审讯开始。父亲和家里其他人都必须作为证人出庭，我陪伴着他们来到法庭。在这对正义进行可悲的嘲弄的过程中，我经受着活生生的折磨。我的好奇心和不法手段所产生的后果，是否会导致两个与我血肉相同的人的死亡，即将被决定了。一个是充满天真和欢乐的笑盈盈的孩子，另一个将更加悲惨地被杀害，她将名誉扫地，让人们永远怀着恐惧记住这件事。于斯丁是一个优秀的姑娘，她的许多好品质本会让她生活得很幸福，而如今一切都将埋没在一堆耻辱的坟墓里了，然而这却是因我而起的！有一千次，我真愿意坦白承认自己应当对于斯丁蒙受的罪名承担责任，可是当事情发生的时候我还没有回家，这样的声明会被当作疯子的胡言乱语，并不能替因我而受难的于斯丁开脱。

于斯丁的外表显得很镇静。她穿着丧服，她本来就很可爱的容貌，因为她内心严肃的感情而更显示出优雅之美。她对自己的清白无辜表现出很强的自信，虽然被千百个人注视和咒骂，她也不曾颤抖。尽管换一种情况，她的美可能会激起人们的慈爱之心，可是到场观看的人们一旦想到她被指控犯下的滔天大罪，慈爱便从心头消失了。她显得很平静，但她的平静显然是自我强制的结果，因为她的惊慌曾被看作有罪的证据，所以她打起精神做出勇敢的样子。走进法庭的时候，她向四周环顾，很快就发现了我们坐的地方。当她看见我们时，泪水似乎使她的视线模糊了，不过她很快就控制住了自己，那种带着忧伤的深情的神态，似乎足以证明她绝对是清白无辜的。

审讯开始了。律师提出对她的指控以后，几个证人被传出庭。好几件事实奇怪地凑合在一起，对她很不利，而任何人要是不像我这样有确凿证据认定她无罪的话，都会感到震惊的。凶杀发生的那天晚上，她整夜不在家，第二天快天亮的时候，一个赶集的女人就在发现孩子尸体不远的地方见到过她。那个女人问她在那儿干什么，而她的神情显得很古怪，只做了语无伦次、含糊不清的回答。她是在八点左右回到家里的。有个人问她那天夜里到什么地方去了，她回答说自己一直在寻找孩子，还急切地询问是否听到了有关孩子的什么消息。当她见到孩子的尸体时，便突然歇斯底里地哭喊起来，随后在床上躺了好几天。接着，法庭出示了仆人在她衣袋里找到的那幅肖像。当伊丽莎白用颤抖的声音证实了，那就是她在孩子失踪前一个小时挂在他脖子上的同一幅肖像时，一阵充满恐惧和义愤的低语声响遍了法庭。

于斯丁被传到庭前来为自己辩护。在审讯进行的过程中，她的神情随时在变化。她强烈地表现出惊讶、恐惧和痛苦。有时候，她是在强力抑制着眼泪，可是当法庭要她做辩护的时候，她打起了精神，用尽管不很稳定却很清晰的声音讲了起来。

“上帝知道，”她说，“我是完全清白的。不过我并不奢望我的辩护能开脱我的罪名，我只能坦诚地、简单地解释那些被引用来控告我的事实，以此证明我的无辜。我希望假如有任何细节显得令人难以置信和怀疑，自己的一贯品行能够使法官们做出有利于我的理解。”

然后她述说道，在凶杀案发生的那天傍晚，她得到了伊丽莎白的允许，待在离日内瓦大约一里格的谢讷村的姑母家里。九点钟左右，在她回来的路上，她遇见了一个男人，问她是否见到过一个失踪的孩子。她听到这个情况后感到吃惊，便花了几个钟头来寻找那个孩子。那时日内瓦的城门关闭了，她只好在一个农舍附属的谷仓里度过了后半夜，她和农舍的主人很熟悉，但不愿叫醒他们。她大部分时间里没阖眼，到快天亮的时候，她相信自己睡着了几分钟，后来有脚步声惊动了她，她就醒了。天已黎明，她便离开了过夜的地方，好继续去寻找我的弟弟。如果她曾走近过他的尸体躺着的地方，那她实际上并不知道。至于那个赶集的女人问她的时候她显得不知所措，那也没什么可奇怪的，因为她刚过了一个不眠之夜，而且可怜的威廉的命运还未弄清。关于那幅肖像，她无法解释。

“我知道，”那不幸的牺牲者继续说，“这种情况对于我来说是多么的严重和生死攸关，可是我又无力将它解释清楚，在我说自己对此一无所知的时候，我只好去猜想是否有这样的可能性，也许有人把那幅肖像放到了我的衣袋里。不过在这里我又被阻挡住了。我相信自己在世界上绝没有一个仇敌，任何人也绝不会恶毒得这样将我横加摧残。是不是凶手把肖像放在那里的？我想他不会有机会这样做，即使我假定他有机会，那他为什么在偷窃了珠宝之后，又这么快地把它丢掉呢？

“我把自己的理由提交法官们公平裁断，然而我看不出有多大的希望。我请求让一些证人来证明我的品格。如果他们的证言还不足以压倒加之于我身上的罪名，那么我就只好被判有罪了，尽管我可以用我灵魂得救的希望来担保我的清白。”

几位证人被传出庭，他们认识她很多年了，也称赞过她，可是他们以为她真的犯了罪，出于害怕和憎恶而变得畏怯了，不愿意站出来做证。伊丽莎白看到这最后的对策——于斯丁优美的性格和无可指责的行为，也不能拯救她了，这时尽管非常激动，仍然要求向法庭陈词。

“我是那个被杀害的不幸的孩子的表姐，”她说，“甚至可以说是他的姐姐，因为自他出生以来，甚至在他出生之前很久，我就受到他的父母的教育，和他的父母生活在一起。所以，在这样的场合下我出庭做证，可能会被视为不合时宜，但是当我看到与我们血肉相连的一个同胞，因为虚伪朋友的怯懦而濒于毁灭的时候，我希望能获准讲话，从而可以谈谈我对她品格的了解。我和被告非常熟悉。我和她在同一所房子里一起生活了五年，后来在另一时期又一起生活了将近两年。在以上所有的时间里，在我看来，她是一个最亲切、最好心的人了。我的婶婶弗兰肯斯坦夫人最后病危的时候，是她以最大的爱和关心照料着她，后来，她又伺候她那长年卧病的母亲，其行为激起了所有知道她的人一致的称赞。在此之后，她再度回到我叔叔的家，在这里她受到全家所有人的爱。她对现已死去的那个孩子怀有深厚的感情，对待他就像一个最慈爱的母亲。至于我，我会毫不犹豫地说，尽管所有的证据都对她不利，但我相信她、信任她的绝对清白无辜。没有任何动机诱惑她去做这样一件事，说到那个作为首要物证的小玩意儿，如果她真的想要它，我本来就会很乐意送给她的，因为我是如此珍爱和器重她。”

随着伊丽莎白简洁而有力的呼吁，响起了一片赞许的窃窃私语声，不过那是被她的宽宏大量的出面干预激起的，而并非是对可怜的于斯丁的同情。对于斯丁，公众却产生了新的普遍义愤，指责她为最无耻的忘恩负义者。伊丽莎白讲话的时候，于斯丁一直痛哭着，但她一言不发。在整个审讯过程中，我的焦虑和痛苦达到了极点。我深信于斯丁的清白无辜，我明白这一点。是不是那个魔鬼杀害了我的弟弟（这我没有片刻的怀疑），又出于恶魔的戏谑而将这个无辜者置于死地和身败名裂呢？我再也承受不了自己这可怕的处境了，当我觉察到大家的说话声和法官们的表情实际上已表明他们判处了我那不幸的牺牲者时，我在剧烈痛苦中冲出了法庭。被告所经受的折磨和我受的折磨并不等同，她有自己的清白无辜作为精神支持，而悔恨的毒牙却撕啮着我的胸膛，而且再也不会放松了。

我纯粹在痛苦中度过了一夜。早晨我去了法庭，我的嘴唇和喉咙像有火在烤着。我不敢询问那个生死攸关的问题，但主管官员认识我，他猜到了我的来意。已经投过票了，全是黑票，于斯丁被定了罪。

即使现在我也无法描述我当时的感受。过去我也体验过恐惧感，我也曾努力给予妥帖的表述，可是语言确实无法传达我当时心如刀绞的绝望。我找到的那个人还补充说，于斯丁已经承认自己有罪了。“这一点，”他评论道，“在如此显而易见的案情里已经并不多么需要了，不过我还是为此而高兴。说真的，我们法官谁也不愿意凭间接证据定罪，不管那是多么的确凿无疑。”

这是一个奇怪而料想不到的消息，这是什么意思？难道我的眼睛会欺骗我？难道我真的疯了，正如假使我披露我怀疑的对象后全世界都会相信我疯了那样？我急忙赶回家中，伊丽莎白急切地要求知道最后结果。

“我的表妹，”我回答道，“正如你可能料想的那样做了判决，所有的法官都宁可判十个无辜者死刑，也不愿让一个罪人逃脱。可是她自己认罪了。”

对坚信于斯丁无辜的可怜的伊丽莎白来说，这是一个可怕的打击。“啊！”她说，“我怎么能再相信人类的善良呢？于斯丁，我就像自己的姐妹那样爱她和尊重她，她怎么能装出纯洁无瑕的笑容，背地里却背叛我们呢？她那温顺的目光似乎绝不可能隐藏着残忍和狡诈，然而她却犯下了杀人罪。”

不久，我们听说那个可怜的牺牲者表示希望见一见我的表妹。父亲希望她不要去，不过他说，还是让她自己的判断和情感去做决定。“好，”伊丽莎白说，“我去，虽然她是有罪的。维克多，请你陪着我，我不能单独去。”这个主意对我而言简直是折磨，可是我没法拒绝。

我们走进阴暗的牢房，看见于斯丁坐在牢房远端的草堆上，她的双手上着镣铐，头枕在双膝上。她看见我们进来，就站了起来，当我们和她单独在一起的时候，她跪倒在伊丽莎白的脚下，痛苦地哭起来。我的表妹也哭了。

“啊！于斯丁！”她说，“你为什么要把我最后的安慰也夺走呢？我本来相信你是无辜的，我原来虽然非常伤心，但也没有现在这样痛苦啊。”

“难道你也相信我是那么、那么坏吗？难道你也和我的敌人一道来毁灭我，判定我是凶手吗？”她的声音被啜泣哽咽住了。

“站起来，我可怜的姑娘，”伊丽莎白说道，“假如你是清白的，为什么要下跪？我并不是你的敌人中的一个，我本来相信你无罪，尽管有一件件证据，直到我听说你自己已经承认有罪为止。告诉我，那个消息是假的。请相信，亲爱的于斯丁，除了你亲口认罪，再没有任何力量能动摇我对你的信任。”

“我的确认了罪，不过我的认罪是假话。我认罪是为了可能获得赦免，可是现在欺骗压在我的心上，比我所有别的罪过都沉重。上帝宽恕我！自从我被定罪以后，我的忏悔神父缠住了我，他恐吓我，威胁我，直到我几乎认为自己就是他所说的那个魔鬼了。他威胁说，假如我继续顽固不化，将在我的最后时刻受到开除教籍和地狱烈火的惩罚。亲爱的小姐，我得不到任何支持，所有的人都把我看作注定要身败名裂、永陷地狱的坏人。我能怎么办呢？我在不幸的时刻只好求助于撒谎，而现在我才真正感到不幸。”

她停了停，哭泣着，然后继续讲下去——“我亲爱的小姐，我一想到你会相信，你在天国的婶婶那么器重的、你也那么钟爱的于斯丁竟会犯下只有魔鬼才会干的罪行，就充满了恐惧。亲爱的威廉！亲爱的、上帝赐福的孩子！我很快就要在天堂再见到你了，在那里我们都将幸福。这给了我安慰，虽然我即将承受耻辱和死亡。”

“啊，于斯丁！原谅我曾有片刻怀疑了你。为什么你要认罪呢？不过，不要悲哀，亲爱的姑娘。不要害怕。我将公开声明，我将证明你无罪。我会用我的眼泪和祈求去溶化你的敌人的铁石心肠。你不能死！——你，我童年的游伴，我的伴侣，我的妹妹，竟死在绞架上！不！不！在这样可怕的灾祸之后，我也绝对活不了了。”

于斯丁悲伤地摇了摇头。“我并不怕死，”她说，“剧烈的痛苦已经过去了。上帝使我摆脱了软弱，赐给我勇气去忍受最坏的命运。我离开的是一个悲惨而痛苦的世界。如果你能记得我，把我看作一个蒙冤定罪的人，我就甘愿屈从那等待着我的命运了。像我这样吧，亲爱的小姐，以忍耐去顺从上天的意志吧！”

在他们谈话的时候，我退到了牢房的一个角落里，在那里我可以掩饰住控制我心灵的可怕的痛苦。绝望了！谁敢说出那件事？那可怜的牺牲者，明天就要跨过生与死的可怕界限了，也不像我这样感到深切而剧烈的痛苦。我咬紧牙齿，把它们磨来磨去，同时发出了一声呻吟，那是从我的灵魂深处发出来的。于斯丁吃了一惊。当她看清是谁的时候，她便走近我，说道：“亲爱的先生，谢谢你好心地来看我。我希望，你并不相信我有罪吧？”

我无力回答。“是的，”伊丽莎白说，“他比我更相信你是无辜的，因为甚至当他听说你已经认罪了的时候，他也不肯置信。”

“我真诚地感激他。在这最后的时刻，我对那些仁慈地想着我的人们怀着最真诚的谢意。对于我这样一个可怜的人来说，别人的感情是多么的甜蜜啊！它使我的不幸减轻了一多半。既然我的清白得到了你，亲爱的小姐，还有你的表哥的承认，我感到我似乎能够平静地去死了。”

这个可怜的受难者就这样极力安慰着别人和她自己。她确实获得了她所想要的安于天命。可是我呢，我这真正的凶手，心中却永远有自责的毒虫在咬啮，我将既无希望，也无安慰。伊丽莎白也在哭泣，也在伤心，但她的痛苦是清白的，它就像一片飘过明月的浮云，有一阵会遮住月亮的光亮，但不能使它黯然失色。痛楚和绝望穿透了我的心房，我的心里有一座地狱，什么也无法使它消灭。我们和于斯丁一起待了几个小时，伊丽莎白极不忍心和她分别。“我真希望自己和你一起死，”她哭喊道，“我不能在这个充满痛苦的世界上活下去。”

于斯丁一面极力抑制住苦涩的泪水，一面强装出高兴的样子。她拥抱着伊丽莎白，带着不能完全抑制的感情说：“永别了，可爱的小姐，最亲爱的伊丽莎白，我心爱的唯一的朋友。愿上天慷慨地赐福于你，保佑你，但愿这是你一生中经受的最后的不幸！活下去，要快乐，同时让别人快乐。”

第二天于斯丁死了。伊丽莎白令人心碎的雄辩没能感动法官，不能使他们改变对这个圣徒般的受难者的有罪认定。我的激烈而愤慨的请求对他们也毫无作用。当我得到他们冷漠的回答，听到这些人粗暴无情的推理时，我事先打算做的声明便从口边化为乌有了。如果我吐露真相，便相当于我宣布自己是个疯子，而绝不可能推翻对可怜的牺牲者的判决。她作为一个杀人犯死在了绞刑架上！

我从自己内心所受的苦刑转而考虑我的伊丽莎白深沉而无言的痛苦。这也是我造成的！还有父亲的愁苦，不久前还喜气扬扬的家庭如今的凄凉——这一切都是我这双应受三重诅咒的手造成的！你们哭泣吧，不幸的人们，然而这还不是你们最后的眼泪！你们还将在葬礼上痛哭，你们悲悼的哭声还将一次又一次地响起！弗兰肯斯坦，你们的儿子，你们的亲人，你们多年的、极其钟爱的朋友，他本愿为了你们洒尽每一滴热血——他不会想到、也不会感到欢乐，除非欢乐也反映在你们的面容上——他本愿让空中响彻他的祝福，并把一生用来为你们服务——可是，他却叫你们哭泣——叫你们流淌无尽的眼泪。假如无情的命运就此得到满足，假如在坟墓的宁静未曾接续到你们可悲的痛苦之前，毁灭就此停住，他将感到超乎希望之外的幸福！

我的灵魂说着这样的预言。当时我正被悔恨、恐惧和绝望撕裂着，看着我所爱的人在威廉和于斯丁的坟头——我亵渎神明的妖术最初的不幸牺牲者的坟头——枉自悲伤着。





第九章　逃避痛苦


对人的精神来说最痛苦的，莫过于在一系列迅速发生的事变激发起感情之后，接着却是无所作为和听天由命的死一般的平静，从而使心灵既无希望，也无恐惧。于斯丁死了，她安息了，而我却活着。血还在我的血管里畅快地流着，但绝望和悔恨的重负却压迫着我的心，没有办法减轻。我无法阖眼入睡，我像鬼魂一样游荡，因为我已经犯下了许多难以形容的可怕的罪孽，以后（我让自己相信）还将犯更多的、多得多的罪孽。然而我的心里是充溢着仁慈以及对美德的热爱的。我怀着造福于人的目的开始生活，渴望着有一天能够实现我的目标，让自己成为人类的有用之材。现在一切都被毁掉了。我本应该享有良心的宁静，能让自己以满足的心情来回顾过去，并由此获得对未来的新的希望，可是现在悔恨和内疚却攫住了我，把我向一座充满着语言无法形容的痛苦折磨的地狱里驱赶。

这种心情摧残着我的健康，而我的健康或许根本就没有从第一次打击中完全恢复过来。我躲避着不见任何人，任何欢乐或愉快的声音对我都是折磨，我唯一的安慰是孤独——深沉的、黑暗的、死一般的孤独。

父亲怀着痛苦注意到了我的性情和习惯中的这种明显的改变，并根据他自己坦然的良心和清白的生活，竭力找理由来激励我，唤起我的勇气去驱散笼罩着我的愁云。“维克多，难道你认为，”他说，“我就不痛苦吗？没有谁比我更爱你弟弟了（他说着说着不禁热泪盈眶），可是我们应该避免以过度忧伤的表现去加重活着的人的痛苦，这难道不是一种责任吗？这也是你对自己应尽的责任，因为过分的哀痛会阻碍你进步和获得欢乐，甚至会使你疏于日常事务，而缺少了这些任何人便不适合在社会中生活。”

这番忠告虽然很好，却完全不适合我的情况。要是在我的感情里，悔恨没有掺杂进它的苦涩，恐惧没有混入它的惊慌的话，我本应是第一个掩藏起自己的伤痛去安慰亲友的人。现在，我只有以绝望的神情来回答我的父亲，并尽力不在他跟前露面。

大约就在这个时候，我们迁回了在贝尔里芙的房子。这一改变对我来说是特别相宜。日内瓦的城门定时在十点关闭，超过那个时刻就不能继续在湖上流连了，这使我非常厌倦在日内瓦城里的生活。现在我自由了。我常常在晚上家人就寝以后划着船，在湖上度过许多钟头。有时候，我扬起帆，让风推着前进；有时候，我把船划到湖心之后，便让船随意飘荡，任自己沉浸在悲凉的思绪中。在周围的一切都归于平静的时分，我是唯一的在这片美丽如仙境的环境中不能安宁的东西——如果我除开那些蝙蝠，或者那些当我靠岸时才能听见它们刺耳的断续鸣叫声的青蛙——这时候，我常常想一头扎进这片宁静的湖里，这样湖水就可以淹没我，并永远淹没掉我的灾难。可是当我想到英勇的而又受着苦难的伊丽莎白，她是我所钟爱的、我的生命与之紧密相连的，我便克制住了自己。我也想到父亲和活着的一个弟弟，难道我要卑鄙地扔下他们，听任他们毫无防备地暴露在我放纵于他们之中的那个魔鬼的毒手之下吗？

每当这些时候，我就苦涩地哭泣起来，并希冀精神能够再归于平静，从而可以给予他们安慰和快乐。然而这是不可能的。悔恨熄灭了一切希望。我是那无可更改的灾祸的根源，我每时每刻生活在担忧中，唯恐我创造出来的那个妖魔会再干出什么新的邪恶勾当。我有一种朦胧的感觉，一切还没有结束，那个魔鬼还会犯下某种惊人的罪行，其剧烈的程度几乎会掩没我们对过去灾难的记忆。我将永远担惊受怕，只要我所爱的事物还存在着。我对这个魔鬼的憎恶简直到了难以设想的程度。一想到他，我就咬牙切齿、眼里冒火，渴望着毁掉这个自己轻率地制造成的生命。一想到他的罪恶和毒辣行径，我的仇恨和复仇意志便冲破了任何节制。我愿意跋涉到安第斯山的峰顶，只要我能在那儿把他摔到山脚下面去。我希望再见到他，这样就可以打碎他的脑袋来尽量发泄我的憎恨，并为威廉和于斯丁复仇。

我们的家成了丧宅。父亲的健康由于近来的可怕事件而深受影响。伊丽莎白悲哀而消沉，日常进行的活动不再使她感兴趣，任何欢乐在她看来都是对死者的亵渎，她认为，永远的哀伤和眼泪是她对被摧残毁灭的无辜者应有的祭品。她不再是那个童年时与我在湖畔流连、欢悦地谈论我们未来前景的快乐的人了。让我们弃绝人世的最初的痛苦已经降临到她身上了，它那吞没光明的力量已经扑灭了她可爱的笑容。

“我亲爱的表哥，”她说，“我一想起于斯丁·莫里兹的惨死，就觉得眼中的世界和世间的事物再也不是从前的模样了。从前，对于书上读到的或从旁人那里听到的罪恶和不公，我总是看作古代的传说，或者虚构出来的邪恶，至少，它们距离我们很远，我们从理性上熟悉它们，而难以去进行想象。可是如今不幸降临到家里来了，我感到人仿佛就是些嗜饮彼此的鲜血的魔鬼。不过我这样想肯定是不公平的。人人都相信那个可怜的姑娘是有罪的。要是她真的犯下了她为此而被处死的罪行，那么她肯定是最堕落无耻的人了。为了一点珠宝，便谋害了她的恩人和朋友的儿子，一个从襁褓中就由她抚育、好像亲生孩子一样被她钟爱的孩子！我不能赞同对任何一个人处以死刑，不过我当然也应该想到，像这样的人确实不配继续留在人类的社会里。可是，她是无辜的。我知道，我感觉得到，她是无辜的。你和我意见一致，这更坚定了我的看法。唉！维克多，当虚假看起来像真实的时候，谁还能够保证自己会享有某种幸福呢？我觉得自己仿佛走在悬崖的边缘上，成千上万的人正朝我这里挤过来，拼命要把我推到深渊底下去。威廉和于斯丁被谋害了，凶手却逍遥法外，他自由地在世上走来走去，或许还受到人们的尊敬。不过即使我因相同的罪行而被送上绞架，也不愿和这样一个卑鄙的家伙交换位置。”

我怀着最剧烈的痛苦听着她的这番话。我，虽然不是在行动上，但在实际上，就是那个真正的凶手。伊丽莎白从我的面容上看出了我的痛楚，便亲切地握住我的手说：“我亲爱的朋友，你得让自己平静下来。这些事变影响了我，上帝知道有多深，但我还不像你那样沮丧。你脸上的神情有时表现出绝望，有时又蕴含着复仇，这使我不禁颤抖。亲爱的维克多，消除掉这些阴郁的感情吧。想想你身边的亲友，他们把自己全部的希望都集中在你的身上了。难道我们失去了使你快乐起来的力量了吗？啊！只要我们相爱——只要我们互相忠诚，我们就可以在这块和平而美丽的土地上，在你的祖国，获得恬静的幸福——还有什么能够扰乱我们的宁静呢？”

我当作命运最高恩典加以珍视的伊丽莎白的这一席话，还不足以驱走潜伏在我心中的那个魔鬼吗？甚至在她说话的时候，我也紧紧贴近了她，仿佛我感到恐惧。我唯恐就在这个时候，那个毁灭者已经走近了，要把她从我身边劫走。

就像这样，无论是友谊的温情，还是世上或天堂的美丽事物，都无法从悲苦中拯救出我的灵魂，即使是爱的话语也无能为力。我被一团愁云包裹着，任何有益的影响力都没法穿透它。一头负伤的麋鹿拖着虚弱的肢体，躲到无人的树丛中，在那里凝视着射穿它身体的箭，然后死去——这就是我的写照。

有时我尚能设法抵御压倒我的阴郁的绝望情绪，但有时心灵中旋风般的激烈情感驱赶着我，我不得不借助于体力活动或者环境的改变，以求解脱我不堪承受的感情。正是在这种心态萌动之时，我突然离家出走，迈步向附近的阿尔卑斯山的峡谷走去，企求在山景的雄伟和永恒中忘却我自己，以及我作为人所具有的短暂的痛苦。我的漫游的目的地是萨姆尼山谷。我在少年时代常到那里去。从那时起六年时光流逝了，我是劫后余生——然而蛮荒的、不朽的景物却毫无改变。

我骑马走了开始的一部分路程，后来我雇了一匹骡子，因为它在崎岖的山路上走得更稳，最不容易受伤。天气很晴朗。当时大约是8月中旬，离于斯丁的死差不多两个月，我的一切痛苦就是从她死去的那个不幸的日子开始的。当我越来越深入阿尔弗峡谷的时候，我便明显感到精神上的重压减轻了。在我四周的顶上耸立着巨大的山峦和绝壁——岩石间急流奔腾咆哮，瀑布从天飞坠，都展示着如万能之主一般的强大威力——万能之主创造和统治着自然的元素，在这里显露出最为摄人心魄的形象，于是，我对任何不如这般强大的事物都不会再害怕，也不会屈服了。而且，我攀登得越高，峡谷便越显出宏伟而令人惊叹的特色。坍塌的古堡高挂在松林覆盖的山峦峭壁上，还有急流飞湍的阿尔弗河，树林中疏落显露的农舍，一起构成了美妙绝伦的风景。而巍峨的阿尔卑斯山更为它增添了崇高壮丽，那些洁白发亮的金字塔形和圆拱形的峰顶高高耸立，俯瞰万物，仿佛是属于另一个世界，是另一种生灵的居所。

我跨过了贝利西埃桥，在这里河流形成的峡谷展现在我的眼前，然后我就开始攀登耸立在河谷上方的山冈。不久，我就进入了萨姆尼峡谷。这个峡谷与我刚刚通过的塞弗克斯峡谷相比更为奇妙和宏伟，但没有它那样美丽如画。它的四周紧紧围绕着高耸的皑皑雪峰，不过我再也见不到坍塌的城堡和肥沃的田野了。巨大的冰川逼近了道路，我听到雪崩发出的雷霆般的轰鸣，看见了它移动时激起的烟雾。勃朗峰，那恢宏壮丽的勃朗峰，从周围的尖峰中高高跃起，它那巨大无朋的圆拱形峰顶巍巍俯瞰着下面的峡谷。

在旅途中，那久已丧失了的令人震颤的欢悦感又常常袭上我的心头。道路的某一处转弯，突然看到似曾相识的某个景物，都使我想起那些消逝了的、与无忧无虑的童年时代相联系的时光。风儿以抚慰的声调在我耳畔悄声细语，慈母般的大自然劝我别再哭泣。可是接着，这种仁慈亲切的影响力又停止了作用——我感到自己又被愁苦束缚住了，重又沉浸在悲痛的思绪中。然后我就驱赶骡子快跑，这样极力来忘掉世界，忘掉恐惧，尤其是忘掉自己——或者以更近乎拼死挣扎的方式，我从骡子背上跳下来，扑倒在草地上，被恐惧和绝望彻底压倒。

我终于抵达了萨姆尼村。在经受了身心的极度疲惫之后，我精疲力竭了。我在窗前伫立了短暂的时间，遥望着苍白的闪电在勃朗峰上空飞舞，倾听着阿尔弗河水在下方河床里喧哗奔腾。这催人入睡的声响对我过于敏锐的感觉而言起到了一种催眠曲的作用：当我的头落到了枕上，睡意就袭来了，我感觉到它的到来，我赞美这忘却的赐予者。





第十章　相遇在阿尔卑斯山


第二天我整天都在山谷里漫游。我站在阿尔弗河源头的旁边，它发源于一座冰山，而那座冰山正缓缓地滑下山岗的顶峰，即将堵住峡谷。我的前面是茫茫群山直立的峭壁，冰山形成的冰墙高高地悬挂在我的顶上，有几棵衰败的松树零零散散地长在四周。在这大自然君主的壮丽的接待厅里一派庄严的肃静，只有潺潺流水声，巨大的碎裂石块的坠落声，雪崩的雷鸣般的轰响声，回响在群山之间的冰层的断裂声，才偶尔打破这一片沉寂。那厚厚累积的冰层由于永恒不变的法则在阒无声息地起作用，不时总在融化和迸裂，仿佛它们只不过是那些自然法则手中的玩物而已。这种种崇高宏伟的景象给了我心灵所能接受的最大的安慰。它们使我所有的渺小情感得以升华，尽管它们并没有消除我的痛苦，但使它减轻了，平和了。在某种程度上，它们使我的思想从一个月以来无法排遣的忧思中转移开去了。晚上我回去寝息，我的睡梦仿佛也有白天所见的壮丽景象相伴。它们簇拥在我的周围，那洁白无瑕的皑皑雪峰，那熠熠发光的峰峦尖顶，那松林，那乱石峥嵘的河谷，那翱翔于云间的鹰隼——它们都聚集在我的身边，祝我内心安宁。

第二天早晨我醒来的时候，它们又消隐到什么地方去了呢？一切振奋心灵的景象都随梦境消失，深沉的忧郁又笼罩了我的每一缕思绪。滂沱大雨倾注着，浓雾遮蔽了群山的峰顶，使我看不清那些伟岸的朋友们的面孔。然而我仍要穿过它们那浓雾的纱幕，到它们云遮雾罩的隐居地去寻找它们。大雨和风暴对我来说又算得了什么？我的骡子被牵到了门前，而我决定去攀登蒙坦维峰。我还记得我第一次见到宏大的、不停移动的冰川时心灵的反应。它使我充满了一种崇高的狂喜之情，从而让我的灵魂长上了翅膀，从这个昏暗的世界高飞到光明和欢乐的处所。的确，每当见到大自然中令人敬畏和宏伟壮丽的事物时，我的思想常常变得庄严肃穆，我忘却了人世转眼即逝的忧烦。我决定不要向导独自前行，因为我对那条路非常熟悉，而且有其他人在场也会破坏风景那种孤寂的壮美。

上山的路十分险峻，不过沿山崖开凿出了蜿蜒曲折的小道，倒可以让你登上直立的峭壁。这是一派惊人的凄凉景象。处处都可见冬季雪崩后遗留下来的痕迹，地上散布着凌乱破碎的树木，有的已完全被摧毁了，有的则弯折了，斜靠着突出的山崖，或者横依在别的树上。随着你攀登得越来越高，小道便常常为雪沟横断，从上面还不断有石头滚落下来。乱石中有一块尤其危险，因为即使是最轻微的声响，甚至高声说话，也会产生空气的振动，足以使得它飞坠下来击碎你的脑袋。这里的松树并不高大繁茂，但它们显得很阴沉，给这派景色添加了一种凛冽肃杀之气。我俯瞰脚下的河谷，茫茫雾气正从穿过峡谷的河面上冉冉升起，并浓密地环绕在对面群山的周围，山顶全都被稠密如一的云团所遮蔽，而这时大雨又从乌黑的天空倾注而下，更加重了我从周围景物里得到的那种阴郁的印象。唉！人为什么要夸口自己具有比野蛮之物更为优越的情感呢，这只不过使他们成为更受束缚的生命。假如推动我们的力量仅限于饥、渴和生之欲望，我们或许可以说自己近乎自由了，可是现在，一阵风吹过，偶然的只言片语，或者这只言片语所表达的情景，都会使我们心生感慨。

我们休憩，梦境毒害我们的睡眠。

我们起身，缠绵思绪污染了白日。

我们感觉，想象，推理；大笑或哭泣，

或耽于哀伤，或摒弃忧虑；

全都一样：因为无论欢乐或痛苦，

到头来都必然消逝。

人的昨日绝不同于明日；

万事不可永存，变易本是常理！

当我攀登到了峰顶的时候，已经接近正午了。我坐在俯瞰冰海的一块岩石上休息了一会儿。一片雾气遮盖了冰海和它周围的群山。不久，一阵微风吹散了云雾，我便下山向冰川上走去。冰川的表面坑洼不平，有的地方就像不平静的海波层层涌起，有的地方又很低，散布着陷落很深的裂隙。冰面大约有一里格宽，而我差不多花了两个小时才横穿过去。对面的那座山是一片光秃秃的峭壁。正对着我所站立的位置的侧面，耸立着蒙坦维峰，距此有一里格远，而在蒙坦维峰的上方则高耸着勃朗峰，宏伟而庄严。我伫立在山崖的一个凹陷处，凝望着这一派奇妙而雄伟的景象。那片海洋，或者不如说是那条茫茫的冰河，在毗邻的群山之间曲折盘旋，群山高耸入云的峰顶就直立在冰河的凹陷处。山顶那冰封的晶莹峰巅在云端泻下的阳光里熠熠闪光。我那不久前还充满忧伤的心，现在满溢着近乎欢乐的感情。我高声呼喊着——“漫游的精灵们啊，假如你们真的在漫游，而不是安卧在狭窄的坟墓里，就请让我享受这微小的快乐吧，要不然就把我当作你们的同伴，带我离开这人世的欢乐吧。”

我正说着的时候，突然看到离我不远处有一个人影，正以超人的速度向我走来。他飞跃过我刚才小心翼翼地走过的冰缝，当他走近时，看得出他的身型也显得比常人高大。我心里发慌，眼前腾起了一片雾，一阵头晕目眩，不过一股寒冷的山风使我很快就镇定下来了。当那个东西走得更近的时候，我看出来（多么庞大和可憎的怪物！）他就是我创造的那个丑恶的家伙。我因为愤怒和恐惧而浑身发抖，决心等着他靠近，然后与他进行生死搏斗。他逼近了，他的表情中带着剧烈的痛楚，又混杂着轻蔑和敌意，而他那非人的丑陋又使这种神情可怕得让人不敢看一眼。不过我几乎没有注意到这一点，愤怒和仇恨最初使我简直说不出话来，但我恢复了镇定，为的是以具有强烈厌恶和蔑视的话语来把他压倒。

“魔鬼，”我高声说道，“你敢靠近我吗？你不怕我凶狠的复仇的手臂砸碎你那可恶的脑袋吗？滚开，邪恶的毒虫！再不就待着，好让我把你踩成烂泥！啊！消灭了你那可恶的生命，但愿那些被你残暴杀害的牺牲者能够复活！”

“我料想到你会这样对待我，”恶魔说，“所有的人都恨可怜虫，我比世上的任何生灵都更不幸，那一定是多么的招人憎恨啊！可是你，我的创造者，也来憎恶和唾弃我，而你是和你的创造物紧紧连在一起的，只有消灭我们之中的一个，才能割断这种联系。你打算杀死我。你怎么敢这样戏弄生命呢？你尽到你对我的责任，那么我也会尽我对你以及对人类中其他人的责任。如果你同意我的条件，我就让他们和你得到安宁，假如你拒绝，我将满足死神的胃口，直到它餍足了你剩余的亲友的鲜血为止。”

“可恶的怪物！你真是个魔鬼！地狱的酷刑也不足以惩罚你的罪恶。令人作呕的妖怪！你责怪我创造了你，那么，来吧，我要扑灭自己轻率赐予的生命之火。”

我简直无法控制自己的怒火，我被拼死决战的愤怒所驱使，猛地向他扑去。

他不费吹灰之力就躲过了我，然后说道：“冷静些！在你把仇恨发泄到我这虔诚的脑袋上之前，请先听我讲几句。难道我受的罪还不够，你还要来雪上加霜吗？生命，虽然只不过是在累积痛苦，但对我来说还是可贵的，我一定要捍卫它。记住，你把我造得比你本人更为强大，我的体型比你高大，我的关节比你柔韧。不过我不会起意跟你作对的。我是你的创造物，我甚至会对我生来的主人和君王温和而柔顺，只要你履行你对我应尽的责任。啊，弗兰肯斯坦，不要对别人都那么公平，却偏偏亏待我一个，你对我最应该公正，甚至宽厚和仁爱。记住，我是你的创造物，我应该是你的亚当(1)啊；不过我倒不如说是那个被贬谪的天使，被你无缘无故地逐出乐园(2)。我到处都看见幸福，而只有我一个被不可挽回地排除在外。我本来是仁慈而善良的，是苦难使我变成了魔鬼。让我幸福吧，我将重新变得善良。”

“滚开！我不听你讲。你和我之间没有任何共同点，我们是敌人。滚开，再不然就让我们决一死战，你我当中必死一个。”

“我怎么才能感动你呢？难道任何恳求都不能让你友善地看一眼你的创造物，这个正在哀求你的仁慈和同情的生命吗？相信我，弗兰肯斯坦，我本来是仁慈的，我的灵魂燃烧着爱和人性，可是我现在不是孤独的、孤苦伶仃的吗？你，我的创造者，也来嫌恶我，那么我还能对你那些并不欠我什么的同类抱什么希望呢？他们唾弃我，憎恨我。荒凉的山岭和阴郁的冰川是我的避难所。我已经在这里游荡了许多天了，冰窟是我唯一不害怕的地方，它们成了我的栖身之地，也是人类唯一不吝惜的处所。我向凄冷的天穹欢呼，因为它比你的同类对我更宽厚。要是众多的人类知道了我的存在，他们一定也会像你所做的那样，武装起来消灭我。那么，我不应该憎恨那些憎恶我的人吗？我绝不和敌人妥协。我是不幸的，他们也得分担我的不幸。不过，你有能力补偿我，从而免除他们的灾难，这场灾难将仅仅因为你而变得极其巨大，不仅你和你的家人，而且有成百上千的人，都要被卷入这狂暴灾难的旋风之中。请你动动恻隐之心，不要蔑视我吧。请听听我的故事——听完以后，唾弃或者同情，听凭你来评判我该得到什么好了。不过你要听我说。按照人类的法律，罪人不管怎样罪大恶极，也能在判罪以前为自己辩护的。听我说，弗兰肯斯坦。你指控我是杀人凶手，而你呢，却心安理得地要毁灭你的创造物。啊，赞美人类的永恒正义吧！可是我并不要求你饶恕——听我讲完，然后，只要你办得到，只要你愿意，就毁灭你亲手创造的作品吧。”

“你为什么要唤起我的记忆，”我回答道，“让我不寒而栗地想起自己就是那些不幸的根源和制造者？可恶的魔鬼，我诅咒你第一次看见天光的那个日子！我诅咒（尽管我是在诅咒自己）那双造出你的手！你已经使我变得不可言喻的悲惨。你已经使我无力去考虑自己到底对你是公正还是不公正。滚开！别让我再看见你那可憎的样子。”

“我这样就可以使你得到解脱，我的创造者，”他说，并把他可憎的双手放到我的眼前。我猛地把它们摔开，“这样，我就可以使你不再看到你所憎恨的形象了。可是你仍然可以听我说话，给我以同情。凭我原来具有的美德，我要求你做到这一点。听听我的故事吧，这个故事又长又离奇，而这儿的气温不适宜你那纤弱的感情，到山上的小屋里去。太阳还高挂在天上，在它降落到那边雪封的峭壁背后，照亮另一个世界以前，你就会听完我的故事，然后做出你的决定。到底我是永远离开人世，过一种无害于人的生活呢，还是成为你的同类的祸根和使你本人迅速毁灭的力量，就完全取决于你了。”

他一边说，一边在冰原上引路，我跟在他的后面。我心事重重，没有搭理他。不过我一面向前走，一面掂量着他提出的种种理由，决定至少也得听听他的故事。我部分出于好奇，此外同情心也坚定了我的决心。我至今为止都认为是他杀害了我的弟弟，所以我急切地想要证实或者否定这个看法。而且，我也是第一次感到一个创造者对他的创造物应尽怎样的责任，在怨恨他作恶之前，我应该首先让他快乐。这些想法促使我同意了他的要求。于是，我们跨过了冰原，爬上了对面的岩石。空气很寒冷，雨又开始下起来，我们进了小屋，那魔鬼兴高采烈，而我却心情沉重，情绪抑郁。不过我答应听他讲，我坐在我那可憎的同伴燃起的火堆旁，他便开始讲他的故事。

第十一章　初识人类


“我回忆自己生命的开始阶段，感到相当的困难，那段时期一切事情都显得混乱和模糊。一团奇异而复杂的感觉攫住了我，在同一时刻里，我开始了看，感觉，听，嗅，确实过了很长一段时间，我才知道分辨不同感官的作用。我记得，有一道强烈的光压迫着我的神经，以致我不得不闭着眼睛。接着黑暗就吞没了我，使我不安。可是我几乎还没来得及感受到这一点，光亮又淹没了我，我现在设想，那是我又睁开了眼睛。我走起来，我相信是在往下走，但是我立即发现感觉发生了巨大的改变。在这之前，黑暗的、不透光的物体包围着我，触摸不到，也看不清，而现在我发现自己能够自由走动，再没有什么障碍是我不能越过或者绕开的。光亮对我的压迫力越来越大，而且我走动的时候，热力使我感到疲惫，于是我就寻找一个能获得荫凉的地方。这个地方就是英戈尔施塔特近郊的森林。在那里，我躺在一条小溪旁休息，消除疲劳，直到我感觉受到了饥饿和口渴的折磨。这使我从接近休眠的状态中醒了过来，后来我就吃了一些悬挂在树枝上和落到地上的浆果。我用溪水来解渴，然后又躺到地上，被睡意所征服。

“当我醒来的时候，天已经黑了，我又感到寒冷，并且仿佛出于本能，发现自己如此孤单而感到有些害怕。在离开你的寓所之前，我因为感到冷曾在身上披了几件衣服，可是它们并不足以为我抵挡夜间的寒露。我是个可怜的、无助的、凄惨的倒霉蛋，我什么也不懂，什么也辨不清，我只觉得痛楚从四面八方袭来，便坐下来哭泣。

“不久，有一道柔和的光布满了天空，并给我一种愉快的感觉。我跳起来，看见一团发光的东西从树林间升起。(1)我带着惊奇凝望着它。它移动得很慢，但它为我照亮了路，我又走出去寻找浆果。我还是觉得冷，这时候我在一棵树下发现了一件宽大的斗篷，于是我把它披在身上，在地上坐下来。我的脑子里没有任何明晰的思想，一切都是混沌不清的。我感觉到光亮、饥饿、口渴、黑暗，数不清的声音在我耳中鸣响，各种各样的气味从四面扑来。我唯一能够清楚辨别的东西就是那个亮晃晃的月亮，于是我就高兴地目不转睛地盯着它。

“白天和黑夜经过了几次交换以后，夜晚的那个圆球就变得很小了，而这时候我也开始能区分开我的各种感觉了。我渐渐地看清楚了供我饮用的那条清澈的小溪，看清楚了用枝叶为我遮阴的树木。当我第一次发现，那种常常传到我耳中的悦耳的声音，是从一只有时会挡住我眼前光线的长翅膀的小动物的喉咙里发出的，我可真是高兴。我也开始更精确地观察围绕在我身边的各种形体，感知那覆盖在我头上的发光的屋顶的边界在哪里。有时候，我还尝试模仿鸟儿那动听的歌声，不过我做不到。有时候，我想用自己的方式来表达感情，可是我吐出的那种粗糙而含混的声音吓得我又赶快闭口。

“在一个夜晚，月亮消失了，后来又以变小了的形状再次出现，在这段时间里我仍然留在森林里。到这时候，我的感觉已经变得清晰起来，我的头脑每天都接受着更多的新概念。我的眼睛开始习惯光亮了，可以看出物体真正的形状，我能区分昆虫和草叶，而且逐渐能分辨各种草之间的差别。我发现麻雀只能发出刺耳的叫声，而乌鸦和画眉的鸣啼则甜美而动人。

“有一天，当我冷得难受的时候，我发现了流浪的乞丐留下的一堆火，并因为体验到火的温暖而喜不自禁。在欣喜中我把手插进了还在燃烧的余烬，但接着我就痛得大叫一声，急忙把手缩了回来。我想，多么奇怪啊，同一种原因却会产生这样截然不同的效果！我仔细查看那火的材料，高兴地发现是由木头构成的。我迅速地捡了一些树枝来，可是它们都是潮湿的，燃不起来。我对此感到很苦恼，静静地坐着看那火是怎么燃烧的。我放在火边的那些湿木头被烤干了，自己就燃了，我就思忖起这一点来。我用手去摸不同的树枝，找到了原因，便急忙捡了一大堆木头，这样我就可以烤干它们，以后就有许多生火的东西了。当夜晚渐渐来临时，也带来了睡眠，我非常担心我的火会熄灭。我小心翼翼地用干木头和干树叶盖在火上，再在上面放上湿的树枝，然后我在地上铺开斗篷，躺在上面，睡着了。

“到早晨我才醒来，首先关心的是那堆火。我揭开上层的覆盖物，一阵微风很快就把它吹成了熊熊大火。我观察到了这个现象，就用树枝编成了一把扇子，在余烬快要熄灭的时候，就用它来扇火。当黑夜再度降临的时候，我高兴地发现火能够产生热，也能够产生光，发现这一点对我的食物很有用，因为我找到过旅行者遗留下来的一些火烤过的残余食物，它们比我从树上采摘的浆果滋味好得多。因此，我也试着用同样的方式处理我的食物，把它们放到火上去烤。我发现用这个办法破坏了浆果的味道，而坚果和根茎的味道却大有改善。

“然而，食物变得越来越稀少了，为了寻找几个橡树子来缓和饥饿的痛苦，我常常要花上一天的时间，而且一无所获。当我发现了这一点，便决定离开我现在的住所，另找一个地方，在那里能够更容易地满足我为数不多的需求。在这次迁移过程中，特别伤心的是我丢掉了偶然获得的火种，而且不知道怎样才能重新燃起火来。我花了好几个钟头来认真考虑如何解决这个难题，可是我仍不得不放弃所有重新得到火的尝试。我用斗篷把自己裹起来，穿过树林向日落的方向走去。我这样游荡了三天，终于发现了一片旷野。前一夜刚刚下过了一场大雪，原野白茫茫一片，景象阴郁，而且我发现脚被地上那种又冷又湿的东西冻得发僵。

“大约在早晨七点钟，我极想得到一点食物和一个栖身之地。终于，我看到在一处高地上有个小茅屋，它无疑是为了某个牧羊人的生活方便而盖的。这是我从未见过的东西，我非常好奇地观察它的结构。看见门开着，我就走了进去。屋里有个老人坐在火炉边，正在上面准备他的早餐。他听见声响便转过身来，一看到我就大声尖叫，跑出茅屋，飞跑着穿过了原野，其速度似乎超过了他那衰弱身体的可能限度。他的模样，和我以前见过的任何东西都不同，他的飞跑则使我吃惊。但我被那所茅屋的样子迷住了，这里雨雪不能穿透，地面是干燥的，那时它对我来说显得如此精美恢宏，就像‘万魔殿’对于经受了火湖的磨难之后的地狱群魔那样。(2)我贪婪地吞下牧羊人剩下的早餐，其中有面包、奶酪、牛奶和酒，不过酒我并不喜欢。后来，我被疲劳所征服，便躺在一个草堆上睡着了。

“我醒来的时候已经到中午了，太阳照耀在雪白的地上，我被太阳的温暖所诱惑，决定继续我的旅行。我把吃剩下的那个农民的早餐装在我找到的一个口袋里，然后横跨田野走了几个钟头，直到日落时分，我来到了一个村子。这里显得多么的神奇啊！茅屋，整洁的农舍，堂皇的房屋，轮番地引起我的赞叹。园子里的蔬菜，一些农舍的窗台上放着的牛奶和奶酪，令我馋涎欲滴。我走进了一所最漂亮的农舍，可是还没等我的脚跨过门槛，那些孩子们就尖叫起来，有一个女人晕了过去。整个村子都骚动了，有的人在逃窜，有的人攻击我，石块和其他飞掷过来的武器直打得我鼻青脸肿，我这才逃到了旷野中，战战兢兢地躲进了一个低矮的窝棚，里面空空如也，和我刚才在村子里见到的那些宫殿相比，它简直是一幅破烂模样。不过这间窝棚却毗邻着一座整洁舒适的农舍，但是在刚才那番惨痛教训之后，我却不敢走进去了。我的这个藏身之地是用木头搭成的，低矮得我只能勉强直坐在里面。可是并没有铺上木板，只是泥土地面，好在地是干燥的；尽管有风从无数的缝隙里吹进来，我却觉得这是一个可以避雪挡雨的舒适的避难所。

“我就在这里隐居了，我躺下来，庆幸自己找到了一个栖身之地，不管多么简陋，总可以躲避严酷的冬天，更能够逃避人类的野蛮行为。

“天一放亮，我就从我的窝里爬出来，想观察一下紧连着的那间农舍，看看自己是不是能够在这个窝棚里继续待下去。窝棚靠着农舍的后部，它的两侧一面是个猪圈，另一面是一池清水。有一面是敞开着的，我就是从这一面爬进来的。现在我把每一个可能让人发觉我的缝隙都用石块和木头堵起来，同时在自己想出去的时候又可以搬动它们。我需要的光亮完全是从猪圈那边透过来的，这对于我来说已经足够了。

“我这样安排好了我的住所，又在地面上铺上一层干净的稻草，就悄悄地躲起来，因为我看到远处有个人影，而我对头天晚上所受的待遇印象太深，不敢让自己落在他的手里。不过，我先就偷了一大块粗面包来做我当天的食物，还有一个杯子，可以用来饮用窝棚旁边流过的清水，这比我用手捧水喝要方便得多了。地面被稍微垫起来了，所以相当的干燥，而且窝棚挨着农舍的烟囱，还算暖和。

“这样装备起来以后，我就决定在这间棚子里住下去，一直住到有什么情况使我改变主意时为止。这里和我以前栖身的地方相比，真可谓是天堂了，那荒凉的森林里只有滴着雨水的树枝，湿漉漉的土地。我愉快地吃起了早餐，并打算搬开一个木板取点水喝，这时我听到了一阵脚步声，我从一个缝隙往外看，看见一个年轻女人头顶着一只水桶从窝棚前经过。这个姑娘年轻而文雅，和我从那以后所见过的其他村姑和农家女仆不一样。可是她的衣着很破旧，只穿着一条蓝色的粗布裙子和一件亚麻布上衣，她那金黄色的头发编成了辫子，但没有任何装饰，她显得从容不迫，但神情忧伤。接着我就看不见她了。大约一刻钟以后，她又顶着桶回来了，桶里现在装着一些牛奶。她走路的时候，好像有点承负不了那个木桶的重量似的，一个年轻男人迎过来，他的面容显得更加郁郁寡欢。他忧郁地说了一点什么，便从她头上接下了木桶，把它提进农舍去。她跟在他后面，然后他们就消失了。不久，我又看见了那个年轻男人，手里拿着一些工具，穿过了屋后的田野，那个姑娘也在忙碌，有时候在屋里，有时候在院子里。

“我仔细检查我的住所时，发现农舍的窗户有一扇原来就开在窝棚这面，现在却被木板给封死了。在一个窗格上有一条小得几乎无法察觉的细缝，刚好眼睛可以透过它张望。透过这个缝隙，可以看到一个小房间，墙壁刷得洁白，收拾得很整洁，但是家具非常少。在一个角落里，靠近火炉边，坐着一个老人，忧伤地用双手托着头。年轻姑娘正在整理着屋子，不过她马上从一个抽屉里拿出了一件东西用手把弄起来，并在老人身边坐下，老人则拿起了一件乐器开始弹奏，那声音比画眉和夜莺的叫声更美妙。这个情景，即使是对于我这个以前从未见过任何美景的可怜虫来说，也是太可爱了！农舍老主人那银白的头发和慈祥的面容使我肃然起敬，而那个姑娘温柔的举止也激起了我爱慕。老人弹奏着一支美妙的哀伤曲调，我发觉那曲调引得他那和蔼可亲的同伴掉下眼泪，而老人却没注意到，直到她哭出了声音。于是他说了一些话，美丽的姑娘放下了她的活计，跪倒在他的脚下。他把她扶起来，而且他是那样充满慈爱和温情地笑着，竟使我感到一种特别的、不可抗拒的激情：这是痛苦和快乐的混合物，是我过去无论从饥饿寒冷还是温暖饱足里都从来没有体验过的。于是我从窗口走开了，我承受不了这种感情。

“这件事过去没多久，那个年轻男子回来了，还扛着一捆木头。姑娘到门口去迎接他，帮他卸下木头，然后拿了一些木头进了屋子，把它们放到了炉火上。然后，她和那个青年走到农舍的一个角落，青年拿出了一大块面包和一片奶酪来给她看。她似乎很高兴，便走进了菜园去拿了一些块茎和植物，先放到水里，然后再放到火炉上。后来她继续干她的活计，而年轻人则进了菜园，好像是忙着挖掘和拔起什么东西的根茎。他这样干了大约一个钟头以后，姑娘也来和他一起干，后来他们就一道进了屋子。

“在这段时间里，老人一直在郁郁沉思着，不过，当他的两个同伴出现的时候，他就换上了一副比较快乐的表情，然后他们就坐下来吃饭。饭很快就吃完了。年轻女子又忙着收拾屋子，老人靠在那个青年的手臂上，在屋子前面的阳光中走了几分钟。再没有什么能比得上这两个优美的人之间的那种对照的美了。一个是老人，满头银发，脸上洋溢着慈爱，一个是青年，身材修长优雅，面容俊美匀称，不过他的眉目神态却表现出极度的忧伤和沮丧。老人回到了屋子里，青年拿起了几件和早晨不同的工具，横跨田野走了。

“夜晚很快就来临了，可是使我极为惊奇的是，农舍的主人有办法拿蜡烛来延长时光，我还高兴地发现，太阳沉落并没有结束我观察我的人类邻人的乐趣。晚上，年轻姑娘和她的同伴还做了各种我不能理解的事情，老人又拿起了早晨曾发出过令我入迷的美妙声音的乐器。他一结束弹奏，青年就开始弄出一些单调的声音，不是用乐器弹奏，而是用口，它们既不像老人的乐器上发出的声音那样和谐悦耳，也不像鸟儿的歌唱。我后来知道他是在朗读，不过当时我还一点不懂关于词句和字母的科学。

“那家人像这样度过了不长的一段时间后，就熄灭了烛光，走开了，我想是去睡觉了。”

第十二章　可爱的一家


“我躺在草堆上，但我无法入睡。我想着白天发生的那些事情。给我印象最深的是这些人的温和的举止，我真想加入到他们当中去，可是我不敢。前晚受到的那些野蛮村民的对待，我记得太清楚了，所以我拿定主意，不管我今后会采取什么我以为是正确的行动，在目前我还是静静地待在我的窝棚里，细心观察，设法找出影响人类行为的动机是什么。

“第二天早晨太阳还没升起，农舍的主人们就起床了。年轻女人收拾屋子和准备早餐，年轻男人吃过饭以后就离开了。

“这一天和前一天按照同样的方式度过了。年轻男人一直在屋外干活，姑娘在屋里做各种各样的杂事。那个老人，我不久就发现他的眼睛是瞎的，用弹奏乐器或沉思来打发他的时光。两个年轻人对他们可敬的长辈表现出的那种爱和尊敬，简直没有什么可以相比。他们对他温柔地尽着无微不至的爱和责任，而老人则用他慈祥的微笑来报答他们。

“他们并不完全快乐。年轻男人常常和他的同伴走到一边去，好像在哭泣。我可看不出他们有任何理由不高兴，不过我还是深深地被这件事所感动。假如这样可爱的人也会痛苦，那么像我这样不完美的、孤孤单单的生命，活得悲惨也就不算奇怪了。可是这些优美的生命为什么会不快乐呢？在我看来，他们有一所可爱的房子和种种享受，寒冷时有温暖的炉火，饥饿时有精美的食物，他们穿着极好的衣服，更愉快的是，他们能彼此做伴，互相交谈，每天大家都以亲切慈爱的态度相待。他们的眼泪意味着什么呢？他们的眼泪难道真的在表示痛苦吗？起先，我不能解答这些问题，不过坚持观察和时间的流逝为我解释清楚了许多开始时像谜一样的事情。

“过了相当长的一段时间，我才了解到使这个可爱的家庭烦恼不安的一个原因是贫穷，他们非常痛苦地承受着这个灾难的折磨。他们的营养完全依靠园子里的蔬菜，还有一头母牛的奶，而在冬天母牛产的奶非常少，因为主人几乎找不到食物来喂养它。我相信，他们常常忍受着饥饿的剧烈痛苦，特别是那两个年轻人，有好多次，他们把食物放到那个老人的面前，一点也没有留下给自己。

“这种好心肠深深地打动了我。在夜间，我已经习惯于偷一点他们储藏的食物来满足自己的需要，可是当我发现这样做是在给他们制造痛苦时，我就停止了偷窃，而是从邻近的树林里采集浆果、坚果和根茎来食用。

“我还发现自己能够通过另一种办法来帮助他们劳动。我了解到年轻人每天都要花很长时间去为家里弄柴火，于是到了夜晚，我就常常拿起他的工具——它们的使用方法我很快就学会了，随后给他们家弄回足够烧好几天的柴火。

“我还记得自己第一天这样做过之后，年轻女人早晨打开了门，看见外面有一大堆木柴，显得非常吃惊。她高声说了几个字，年轻男人便到她这儿来了，他也露出了吃惊的表情。我高兴地注意到，他那天就没有到森林里去了，而是整天修补房子和种菜园。

“渐渐地，我发现了一桩更重要的事情。我发现这些人有一种办法，能通过清晰的声音来交流他们的经验和感情。我察觉到他们说的那些字，常常使听的人头脑里或面容上产生快乐或者痛苦，笑容或者悲哀。这真是一种神奇的学问，我热切地渴望要了解它。不过我为了这个目的而做出的每一步努力都受到了挫折。他们发声很快，而且他们说出的字与可见的事物没有任何明显的联系，我找不到任何线索来解开声音和事物的连接之谜。不过经过我的苦心琢磨，在窝棚里又待了好几轮月亮形状变化的时间，我终于了解了他们的谈话中最常说到的一些东西的名称。我学会了并且能使用‘火’‘牛奶’‘面包’‘柴火’这些字。我还学会说小屋主人们的名字。年轻人和他的同伴每个人都有几个名字，而老人只有一个，那就是‘父亲’。那个姑娘叫‘姐姐’，或者‘阿加莎’，那个青年叫‘费利克斯’，‘弟弟’，或者‘儿子’。当我懂得了给每一个声音所分配的意思，并且自己也能发出它们来的时候，那种快乐简直是无法形容的。我还可以分辨出几个其他的字，不过还不能了解和运用它们，例如‘好’‘亲爱的’‘不快活’。

“就这样我度过了那个冬季。小屋主人们温柔的态度和美丽的形象为我所喜爱，当他们不快活的时候，我也感到沮丧，当他们高兴的时候，我又和他们一起快乐。除了他们以外，我很少见到其他人类，即使有什么人偶尔走进那间农舍，他们粗鲁的态度和粗俗的举动只能使我更感到我的朋友们品行优秀。我可以觉察到，老人常常极力鼓励他的孩子们——我有时听到他这样称呼他们——要抛开忧愁。他总是以一种快乐的语气和慈爱的表情讲话，这甚至让我也感到愉快起来。阿加莎很恭敬地听着，她的眼里有时涌满了泪水，于是她就尽量让人不察觉地把泪水擦掉。不过在一般情况下，在她听完了她父亲的教诲之后，表情和声调会变得更快活些。费利克斯就不一样。在这几个人当中他是最忧伤的，即使我的毫无经验的感官，也能感觉到他似乎比他的朋友们更痛苦。不过，如果说他的面容更忧愁的话，他的声音却比他的姐姐显得更快活，特别是当他对老人说话的时候。

“我可以举出无数的事例来，它们虽然都微不足道，却能表明这些可爱的村民有怎样的性情。在贫困和匮乏的生活中，费利克斯会高兴地给姐姐带来雪地上刚刚冒出来的第一朵小花。清晨在她起床以前，他就扫干净了她去奶棚的小路上的积雪，从井里汲了水，从屋外的棚子里拿来了柴火，在那里，使他一直感到惊讶的是，总是有看不见的手给他们增添着储存。我相信，白天他是去给附近的农民干活，因为他常常出门，晚饭时才回家，却没有带回任何柴火。其他时间他就在菜园里劳动，在霜冻的日子里没有多少活干，他就给老人和阿加莎念书。

“起初，念书这事使我极为迷惑不解，不过慢慢地我就发现，他念书的时候发出的许多声音和他说话的时候是一样的。因此我就猜想，他在纸上看到了他懂得的一些代表说话的符号，于是我也热切地渴望懂得这些符号，可是，既然我连那些符号所代表的声音也不明白，怎么可能懂得这些符号呢？然而我在这门学问里已经有明显的进步，只不过尽管我集中注意力，理解力还不足以跟上他们的任何谈话罢了。我很容易看出，虽然我渴望让小屋主人知道我，但在我没有首先掌握好他们的语言之前，不能做这种尝试。懂得了语言，也许能使他们不在乎我那畸形的外貌，因为我始终看到自己的形体和他们相比构成了鲜明的对照。

“我赞赏小屋主人们那完美的形体——他们的优雅，美丽，以及精美的皮肤。当我在清澈的池水中照见自己的时候，我是多么的惊骇啊！一开始我吓得跳了起来，不敢相信那映在水中的镜像就是我自己。等我完全确信自己真的就是那个怪物的时候，心里充满了沮丧和屈辱的极度痛苦。唉！我当时还不完全懂得这可悲的丑陋会发生致命的作用。

“随着太阳渐渐变得温暖起来，白天变得越来越长，积雪溶化了，我看见了光秃秃的树木和黑油油的土地。从这个时候起，费利克斯就更加忙碌了，那种处于饥饿边缘的令人伤心的迹象也消失了。他们的食物，正如我后来发现，是粗糙的，却是有益于健康的，现在食物也很充足了。他们修整了菜园，里面长出了几种新的蔬菜。随着季节的变化，他们的生活也逐日显示出舒适的迹象。

“如果没有下雨——我发现当天上落下水的时候，他们就这样称呼它——每天中午，老人便靠在儿子手臂上散步。时常都会下雨，不过一阵大风会很快吹干地面，这个季节变得比以前要愉快得多了。

“我在窝棚里的生活始终如一。早晨，我注意着主人们的活动，当他们各自忙着干活的时候，我就睡觉。一天剩余的时间，我用来观察我的朋友们。当他们回房睡觉的时候，如果有月亮，或者有星光，我就到树林里去，为自己采集食物，为小屋主人捡柴火。回来的时候，只要有必要，我就清扫小路上的积雪，还干些我看到费利克斯干过的事情。我后来发现，由看不见的手为他们干的这些活儿，令他们大为惊讶。在这种情况下，有一两次我听见他们说什么‘善良的精灵’‘真奇妙’，不过我当时还不懂这些字的意义。

“我的思想现在变得更活跃了，而且我渴望了解这些可爱的人心里的动机和感情，我想弄清楚费利克斯为什么显得那样痛苦，阿加莎又为什么显得那样悲哀。我想（愚蠢的可怜虫！）我也许能够让这些应该快乐的人重新得到快乐。当我睡觉或者在外边的时候，那个可敬的失明的父亲、温柔的阿加莎和优秀的费利克斯的形象时常掠过我的眼前。我把他们看作比自己更优越的生命，他们将作我未来命运的主宰者。我在想象中勾画出上千的画面，设想自己怎么出现在他们面前，他们又将怎样接待我。我想象他们会感到厌恶，直到我用温柔的态度和劝慰的话语首先赢得他们的好感，然后再博得他们的爱。

“这些想法使我感到振奋，并使我以新的热情去学习语言的技艺。我的发音器官的确很粗糙，不过还算柔韧，尽管我的声音很不像他们的语调那样如柔和的音乐，但我到底能基本清楚地像自己理解的那样发出声来。这就像驴子和哈巴狗，温顺的驴子尽管模样很粗鲁，但它的心是好的，应该受到更好的待遇，而不应挨鞭打和咒骂。

“春天快意的骤雨和宜人的温暖大大改变了大地的面貌。在这种变化以前，人好像一直躲在洞穴里，现在处处散布着，展示着各种耕作的技艺。鸟儿唱着更加欢快的歌儿，树上的叶子萌发了新芽。欢乐的、欢乐的大地啊！你在不久前还是凄凉、潮湿和有害于健康的，现在却成了神居住的地方。我的精神也被大自然迷人的景象所振奋鼓舞，往日已经从我的记忆里抹去，目前是一片宁静，而未来则在希望和对欢乐的期待的光辉里，被照耀得金光灿烂。”





第十三章　知识与痛苦


“我现在要赶快叙述我的故事中更为动人的部分。我将讲述种种深刻影响我的感情的事件，这些感情使我变得和从前大不相同，而成了现在的我。

“春天很快地过着，天气变得很好，晴空万里无云。从前荒凉阴郁的地方现在竟会开放着美丽的鲜花和长出青草绿叶，真让我惊奇。成千种令人愉悦的香气，成千种美丽的景色，使我的感官得到满足和振奋。

“就在这些日子里的一天，当小屋的主人们在劳作之余定期休息的时候——老人在弹着吉他，孩子们在听着——我留意到费利克斯的面容带着说不出的忧伤，他还不断地叹气。他父亲有一次停止了他的音乐，我从他的态度来猜测，是在询问他儿子悲伤的原因。费利克斯用快乐的声音来回答父亲，然后老人正要开始重新弹奏，突然有人在轻轻地敲门。

“那是一个骑着马的女子，还有一个充当向导的农民陪伴着她。那个女子全身穿着黑衣服，脸上还蒙着一条厚厚的黑纱巾。阿加莎问了她一个问题，陌生女子只用甜美的声音回答了费利克斯的名字。她的语音很动听，但和我的朋友们的口音都不相同。费利克斯一听到他的名字，急忙向这个女子走来。女子看见了他就撩起了面纱，于是我看见了具有天使般的美、带着天使般的表情的一张脸。她的头发乌黑发亮，编成了很奇怪的形状；她的眼睛也是黑色的，活泼有神，又很温柔；她的容貌匀称端正，皮肤极为白皙，两颊还微微泛起可爱的红晕。

“费利克斯见到那个女子的时候高兴得发狂，所有忧愁的迹象从他的脸上一扫而光，顿时充满了欢乐，那种欣喜的程度我认为简直难以置信。他的脸上快乐得发红，眼睛里闪耀着火花，这时候我觉得他就和那个陌生女子一样的美丽。女子好像怀着与他不同的心情，她擦去了美丽的眼睛里落下的几滴泪珠，把一只手伸给了费利克斯，费利克斯则狂喜地吻着她的手，还称她为——按照我能分辨出的声音——他可爱的阿拉伯人。她好像并不懂得他的话，只是微笑着。他扶她下了马，打发了向导，把她引进了小屋。他和父亲进行了一阵谈话。那个年轻的陌生女子在老人的脚下跪倒，正要吻他的手，但是老人扶起了她，并且亲切地拥抱了她。

“我很快就察觉到，尽管陌生女子说话声音很清楚，但似乎讲的是她自己的一种语言，她讲的话小屋主人们不懂，她也不懂他们讲的话。他们互相做了许多我不明白的手势，不过我看出来，她的到来使小屋里里外外都充满了欢乐，就像太阳驱散早晨的雾气一样驱散了他们的忧伤。费利克斯显得特别快乐，用愉快的笑容来迎接他的阿拉伯人。阿加莎，那永远温柔的阿加莎，则吻着那可爱的陌生女子的手，她还指着她的弟弟做着手势，在我看来，是说在女子到来之前他一直很悲伤。就这样他们度过了几个钟头，从面容看都显得很快乐，至于原因我却不明白。我不久就发现，那个陌生女子不停地跟着他们反复发出同样的声音，于是我知道那是她在努力学习他们的语言。我立即就有了一个念头，我应当利用这种教导来达到同样的目的。陌生女子在第一课里学会了大约二十个字，其中大多数都是我以前就懂得的，不过其他的字使我有所收益。

“夜晚到来了，阿加莎和那个阿拉伯人很早就回房间去了。当他们分手的时候，费利克斯吻着陌生女子的手说：‘晚安，可爱的沙菲。’他又再坐了很久，和父亲谈着话。从他不断地提到她的名字来看，我猜想他们谈话的内容就是他们那可爱的客人。我急切地渴望了解他们的谈话，为了这个目的而竭尽全力，可是我发现自己一点也不能理解。

“第二天早晨，费利克斯出门去干活。阿加莎的日常事务做完了以后，阿拉伯女子就坐在老人的脚下，拿起了他的吉他弹奏乐曲。乐曲是那样令人入迷的美妙，竟立即使我的眼中涌出了悲喜交集的泪水。她唱起了歌，她的歌声婉转流畅，抑扬顿挫，时而高昂，时而轻微，就像树林里夜莺的鸣啼。

“她唱完以后，就把吉他递给阿加莎，阿加莎起初推辞，后来她弹了一支简单的曲子，并用甜美的歌声来伴唱，不过她的歌曲和陌生女子的并不相像。老人似乎欣喜得着了迷，他说了一些话，阿加莎努力向沙菲解释老人的话，那些话似乎是老人表示她的音乐给了自己极大的快乐。

“现在，日子似乎在和过去一样平静地流逝着，唯一的改变是，我的朋友们脸上的悲伤已经被快乐所取代。沙菲总是欢乐和愉快的，她和我在语言知识方面都进步迅速，过了两个月，我的保护人所讲的大部分话，我都能够听懂了。

“在此期间，黑油油的土地被青草覆盖了，翠绿的河岸上散布着无数的花朵，芳香而悦目，在月光照耀下的树林里闪烁着点点微弱的亮光。阳光变得更温暖，夜色明净而温馨。我夜间的漫游是一种极大的乐趣，尽管太阳的晚落早起大大地缩短了它的时间，因为我从不冒险在白天走出去，害怕得到我在第一个村子里曾经遭遇过的那种待遇。

“我在白天的时间里都集中注意力，以便能够更快地掌握他们的语言，而且我可以夸口说我比阿拉伯女子的进步更快，她只能理解很少一点，说话也结结巴巴，而我对他们讲的每一个字几乎都能听懂，并且能够模仿。

“我一面提高自己讲话的能力，一面也随着陌生女子学习的课程学文字，这为我开辟了一个奇妙而充满乐趣的广阔天地。

“费利克斯教沙菲的那本书是沃尔涅的《帝国的衰亡》。(1)如果费利克斯不是一边念一边详细解释的话，我本来是理解不了这本书的含义的。他说他之所以选择了这本书，是因为它的雄辩风格乃是模仿东方作家才形成的。我通过这本书获得了历史方面的粗浅知识，对世界上现存的几个帝国也有了一个概略的了解，它使我较深地理解了地球上不同国家的生活方式、政府和宗教制度。我听说了什么懒散的亚洲人，希腊人的巨大的天才和精神活动，早期罗马人的战争和奇异的美德——他们后来的堕落——他们强大帝国的衰亡，还有骑士制度，基督教和国王等等。我也听说了美洲半球的发现，还和沙菲一道为当地土著居民的不幸命运而哭泣。

“这些神奇的故事激起了我许多奇特的感情。难道人类，一方面如此强大，如此高尚和健美，另一方面却又如此邪恶和卑鄙？他们一会儿似乎纯粹是罪恶原则产下的后裔，一会儿又是一切可以想象到的高贵的、神明般的品德的体现者。做一个伟大而具有美德的人，对于任何一个感觉敏锐的生命而言，似乎应该是最高的荣誉；做一个卑鄙邪恶的人，就像许多在历史上记载的人那样，则应是最低贱的堕落，那种状况比瞎眼的鼹鼠或无害的蠕虫还要卑鄙。有很长时间，我没法设想一个人怎么能去杀害他的同类，甚至不懂为什么要有法律和政府，可是当我听见了许多罪恶和流血的具体细节之后，我就不再惊奇了，而是怀着厌恶和鄙弃掉过头去。

“小屋里的人们每次谈话都给我展开了新的奇异景象。在我听费利克斯给阿拉伯女子讲课的时候，我懂得了人类社会那奇怪的制度。我听到了财产分配，巨大的财富和悲惨的贫穷；我听到了等级、家系和血统。

“这些话使我回过头来考虑自己。我懂得了，你的同类们最为珍视的占有物乃是与财富联系在一起的高贵而纯正的血统。一个人只要拥有了这两种有利条件中的一件，就会受到尊敬。可是，假如他一件也没有，除了极为罕见的例外情况之外，他就会被视为流浪汉或者奴隶，注定要为少数特别选出的人的利益而耗费他的精力。那么我又是什么呢？对于我被创造出来的情况和我的创造者，我一无所知，不过我知道自己没有金钱，没有朋友，也没有任何财产。此外，我还被赋予了一个丑陋畸形、令人憎恶的可怕形体，甚至我的属性也和人不一样。我比他们更灵活，能依靠粗劣的食物生存，我能承受极度的冷和热而不致损伤身体，我的体型也大大超过了他们。当我环顾周围的时候，我没见到、也没听到过有像我这样的生命。这么说来，难道我是一个谁都要逃避、谁都不接纳的怪物？是大地上的一个污点吗？

“我无法形容这些想法给我带来的那种剧烈痛苦，我竭力要驱散这些念头，可是随着知识的积累，苦恼也在增长。啊，但愿我永远留在我最初生活的树林里，除了饥、渴和炎热以外便一无所知、一无所感！

“知识具有多么奇怪的性质！它一旦控制了你的头脑，就紧紧地缠住了它，就像附着在石头上的苔藓一样。有时候，我真希望摆脱掉一切思想和感情，可是我明白，只有一个办法能克服痛苦的感觉，那就是死——那是我害怕然而又不能理解的一种状态。我赞赏我的主人们的那些美德和美好的感情，热爱他们温柔的举止与和蔼的性格。可是我不可能和他们直接接触，只有在他们看不见和不知道的情况下偷偷地和他们打交道，而这样并不能满足，而是更增强了我想成为他们之中一员的渴望。阿加莎那温柔的话语，迷人的阿拉伯姑娘那生气勃勃的笑容，都不是为了我。老人那温和的教诲，可爱的费利克斯那活泼生动的谈话，也不是为了我。悲惨的、不幸的可怜虫！

“费利克斯讲的其他课程给我的印象甚至更深。我听说了两性的区别，孩子的出生和成长，父亲怎样陶醉于婴儿的微笑和大孩子活泼的俏皮话，母亲的全部生活和关切又是怎样倾注在她的宝贝身上，青年的头脑怎样扩充和取得知识，以及兄弟、姐妹和其他种种关系怎样把一个人和另一个人联结在一起。

“可是，我的朋友和亲戚又在哪里？在我的婴儿时期没有父亲照看过我，也没有母亲用微笑和抚爱来祝福过我。即使他们这样做过，我过去的所有生活如今也变成了一团污迹，一片空白，我在里面什么也分辨不出来了。在我最早的印象里，我就已经具有和现在一样的重量和体型了。我从来没有看见过和我一样的生命，也没有任何人宣称他和我有过任何关系。我是什么呢？这个问题一再出现在我心中，我只有用呻吟来回答。

“我很快就会向你解释，这些感情将朝什么方向发展，不过现在请允许我回到小屋主人们身上来，他们的故事激起了我各种各样的感情，愤慨、快乐以及惊奇，而这一切又最终加深了我对我的保护者的爱和敬意（我怀着天真的、半带痛楚的自欺心理，喜欢这样称呼他们）。”

第十四章　小屋主人的故事


“过了一段时间，我才了解到我的朋友们的历史。它展开了一系列的情景，其中每一个对于完全缺乏体验的我来说都是有趣而奇妙的，不能不给我心中刻下了极深的印象。

“那个老人的名字叫作德·拉舍。他出身于法国的一个名门世家，在那里富足地生活了许多年，受到地位更高的人的尊重和相同地位的人的爱戴。他的儿子为国服役，阿加莎置身于最具声誉的贵夫人之列。在我来到这里之前几个月，他们还住在一个叫作巴黎的又大又奢华的城市里，被很多朋友簇拥着，享受着美德、文雅的智慧，或者说是高雅趣味，以及适度的财产所提供的所有快乐。

“沙菲的父亲就是导致他们生活崩溃的根源。他是个土耳其商人，在巴黎也住了很多年，由于我不懂得的某种原因，他后来成了法国政府讨厌的人。就在沙菲从君士坦丁堡到巴黎他这儿来的那一天，他被逮捕了，进了监狱。他受到审讯并被判处了死刑。对他的判决是极不公正的，整个巴黎都愤慨了，大家认为定罪的原因在于他的宗教信仰和财富，而不是他被指控的所谓罪行。

“费利克斯在审讯的时候碰巧在场，当他听到法庭的判决时感到不可遏制的惊骇和义愤。就在那个时刻，他庄严地立誓要救他出来，然后就找寻营救的办法。在他试图进入监狱的多次尝试毫无结果之后，在监狱没人防卫的一边，他发现有一扇牢固地上了铁条的窗户，光线就从那里照进了关着不幸的伊斯兰教徒的地牢。他被加上了重重镣铐，在绝望中等待着执行对他的野蛮的判决。费利克斯在夜间来到了铁窗前，告诉那个囚徒自己营救他的意图。那个土耳其人又惊又喜，竭力煽起营救者的热情，许诺以重酬和财富。费利克斯轻蔑地拒绝了他的条件，不过当他看见了被允许来探望父亲的沙菲，而且沙菲用手势表达了她强烈的感激时，年轻人不禁这样想：这个囚犯有一件珍宝，足以完全酬报自己的辛苦和危险的地方。

“土耳其人很快就察觉出他的女儿在费利克斯心中留下的印象，为了更牢靠地拴住费利克斯为自己效力，他答应一旦自己被送到了安全的地方，就让女儿和他成婚。费利克斯很体贴人，没有接受这个提议，不过他盼望着这桩事有可能会实现，从而达到幸福的顶点。

“在后来的几天里，正当为商人逃跑的准备工作处于进行之中的时候，费利克斯的热情因为收到了那个可爱的姑娘的几封信而更加炽烈了。姑娘通过父亲的一个懂得法语的老仆人，用她情人的语言表达了自己的意思。她以最热烈的措辞感激他为她父亲所做的事，与此同时，她又幽幽哀叹她自己的命运。

“我抄写下了这些信件，因为我住在那个小棚子里的时候，设法找到了写字的工具，而且费利克斯和阿加莎时常把这些信拿在手里念。在我离开之前，我会把它们交给你，它们会证明我的故事的真实性，不过现在太阳已经低低落下，我只来得及给你复述一下它们的基本内容。

“沙菲说到她的母亲是一个信奉基督教的阿拉伯人，被土耳其人掳掠而沦为奴隶，由于她的美丽，她赢得了沙菲父亲的心，他娶了她。这年轻姑娘用崇高而富于热情的言辞谈到她的母亲，说她生来是个自由人，鄙弃现在所受的束缚。她以基督教义来教育自己的女儿，教导她应该追求更高的智慧，坚持精神的独立，而那是伊斯兰教禁止女教徒获得的。后来母亲死了，不过她的教导不可磨灭地印在了沙菲的心上，她一想到要再被送回到亚洲，被禁闭在后宫的高墙内，只许做些幼稚愚昧的娱乐，就感到和她心灵的情趣格格不入，不禁十分厌恶，因为她的心灵已经习惯于崇高的思想和对美德的高尚追求了。嫁给一个基督徒，留在一个允许妇女在社会上占有一席之地的国家里，这种前景使她入了迷。

“处死土耳其人的日子已经确定了，可是，就在那一天的前夜，他逃离了监狱，在天亮以前就逃到了距巴黎数里之外的地方。费利克斯早已以他父亲、姐姐和本人的名义取得了几份护照。他事先就把他的计划通报给了父亲，他父亲助了一臂之力，伪装出门旅行而离开了家，和女儿一道藏匿在巴黎一个偏僻的地方。

“费利克斯引着逃亡者穿越法国来到里昂，又越过塞尼峰到了莱格亨。在那里，商人决定等到一个有利的时机，再转移到土耳其管辖的某个地方去。

“沙菲决定留在她父亲身边，直到他最后离开的时刻。在最后离开之前，土耳其人又重申他的保证，要让女儿和他的救命恩人结合。费利克斯也留下和他们在一起，期待着那桩喜事，与此同时，他也享受着与那个阿拉伯姑娘做伴的快乐，她对他表示出了最单纯、最温柔的情意。他们借助翻译互相交谈，有时候则通过眼神互通款曲，沙菲还给他唱自己祖国的美妙歌曲。

“土耳其人允许这种亲密的关系，并鼓励这对年轻的恋人对未来怀抱希望，然而他心里却另有打算。他一想到女儿会和一个基督徒结合就感到厌恶，可是他又害怕自己要是表现得三心二意，便会惹恼费利克斯，因为他明白自己仍然处于他的营救者的力量之下，费利克斯可以选择出卖他，向他们居留的意大利当局告发。他用尽千方百计，使自己能够继续欺骗费利克斯，直到完全没有必要的时候，他就会在自己离开的时候秘密地把女儿带走。

“法国政府对他们的牺牲者的脱逃大为光火，于是不遗余力地要找到和惩罚那个营救者。费利克斯的密谋很快就被发现了，德·拉舍和阿加莎被投进了监狱。这个消息传到了费利克斯的耳中，使他从欢乐的梦中惊醒了。他那失明的年迈的父亲，他那温柔的姐姐，现在躺在肮脏腐臭的地牢里，而他却呼吸着自由的空气，和自己心爱的人相伴相依。这个想法对他简直是一种折磨。他立即和土耳其人做了安排，如果在他回到意大利之前，他们能够找到有利机会逃出意大利的话，沙菲就寄居在莱格亨的一所修道院里，然后，他就离开了可爱的阿拉伯姑娘，赶到了巴黎，把自己交给法律听凭处治，希望这样可以解救德·拉舍和阿加莎。

“他并没有成功。他们一家被监禁了五个月，然后才开始审判。结果是剥夺他们的财产，并被判处终生流放国外。

“他们在德国的一个村舍里找到一个可怜的居所，我就是在那里见到他们的。费利克斯不久就打听到了那个背信弃义的土耳其人（为了这个人，他和他的家人才经受了这种闻所未闻的迫害），他一发现自己的救命恩人已经被弄得家贫如洗，就背弃了良心和荣誉，带着女儿离开了意大利，并侮辱性地给费利克斯寄来了一小笔钱，按照他的说法，是资助他们将来的生活。

“我初次见到费利克斯的时候，就是这些事变折磨着他的心，并使他成了全家最不幸的人。他可以承受贫穷，并且因为这场危难本是他的美德的应得报偿，他也为此感到光荣，可是，那个土耳其人的忘恩负义，失去他心爱的沙菲，则是更为痛苦和不可弥补的不幸。现在，这位阿拉伯姑娘的到来，给他的心灵注入了新的生气。

“当费利克斯被剥夺了财产和地位的消息传到莱格亨的时候，那个商人命令他的女儿不得再想念她的恋人，却要她做好准备返回她的祖国去。天性慷慨正直的沙菲被他的命令激怒了，她力图规劝她的父亲，可是他重申他那暴君式的训令，怒气冲冲地走了。

“过了几天，土耳其人走进了女儿的卧室，急匆匆地告诉她说，他有理由相信自己在莱格亨的住处已经暴露，他很快就会被引渡给法国政府，因此，他已租好了一条船载他去君士坦丁堡，几小时之后就要驶向那里。他打算把女儿交给一个可靠的仆人照料，将来带上迄今尚未抵达莱格亨的大部分财产，从容地回国。

“沙菲单独留下以后，她在心里确定了自己在这种紧急情况下应该采取的行动。在土耳其定居是她所厌恶的，她的宗教信仰和她的感情都与此对立。从偶然发现的她父亲的一些信件里，她了解到了她的恋人被流放的情况，并知道了他当时落脚的地方。她犹豫了一段时间，终于拿定了主意。她随身携带了一些属于自己的珠宝和一笔钱，和一个侍女一道离开意大利前往德国，那个侍女是莱格亨当地人，懂得土耳其日常用语。

“她安全地到了距德·拉舍的茅屋约二十里格的一个小镇，这时她的侍女得了急病。沙菲全心全意地照料她，但那可怜的姑娘还是死了，撇下阿拉伯姑娘孤身一人，她不懂这个国家的语言，也完全不了解当地的风俗。不过她遇见了好心人。她的侍女曾经提到过她们目的地的地名，在她死去以后，她们寄宿的那家女房东设法让沙菲平安地到达了她恋人的小屋。”





第十五章　野性的升华


“这就是我所爱的小屋主人的历史。它深深地打动了我。从它所展示的社会生活景象，我懂得了应该钦佩他们的美德，唾弃人类的罪恶。

“到那时为止，我还把犯罪看作一桩离自己很遥远的祸害，仁爱和慷慨始终在感召着我，激发起我的一种欲望，想要在倡导和展现着如此丰富的可敬品德的热烈场景中去做一个演员。不过，在叙述我心智方面的进步时，不应该忽略当年8月初发生的一件事情。

“一个夜晚，当我像平常那样到邻近的树林里，去采集食物和为我的保护者拾取柴火的时候，我在地上发现了一个皮箱，里面有一些衣物和几本书。我急忙抓起这个意外收获，带着它回到了窝棚。很幸运，这些书正是用我在小屋里学得了基本知识的那种语言写成的，它们包括《失乐园》、一卷普鲁塔克的《名人传》和《少年维特的烦恼》。(1)得到这批珍宝使我喜不自胜；现在，当我的朋友们忙着他们的日常事务的时候，我就持续不懈地读这些故事，锻炼自己的头脑。

“我难以向你形容这些书对我产生了怎样的影响。它们在我心中激起了无穷无尽的新的想象和感情，有时候使我欣喜若狂，但更多的时候是令我陷入深沉的沮丧之中。在《少年维特的烦恼》里，除了它质朴感人的故事很有趣以外，还详细探讨了那么多的见解，揭示了那么多至那时为止对我来说还是模糊不清的问题，所以我在其中找到了永不枯竭的思考和惊奇的源泉。它所描写的那种温柔而富于家庭气氛的言谈风度，以及追求自身之外更崇高的目标的高尚情怀，和我在我的保护者当中获得的体验相吻合，也和我自己心中一直存在的渴望相一致。不过我认为，维特本人比我所见过或想象过的任何人更为圣洁，他的性格里绝无半点虚伪矫饰，然而其痛苦又极为深沉。书中对于死亡和自杀的专门探讨使我充满惊异。我不敢擅自对这个问题的是非得失加以评论，但我倾向于赞同主人公的意见，他的死令我落泪，尽管我还不能准确地理解其意义。

“然而，在阅读的时候，我总是要联想起自己的感情和处境。我发现，和我在书中所读到的那些人物以及在书中所提到的谈话相比，我既是非常相似，又是奇怪地不同。我与他们感受相通，也部分地理解他们，可是我的心智构造并没有完成，我对谁也不依附，和谁也没有关系。‘死亡是必由之路’；然而在这个世界上无人会哀悼我的死亡。我形象可憎而体型巨大。这是什么意思？我是谁？我是什么？我从哪里来？我到哪里去？这些问题不停浮现在脑海里，可是我无法解答。

“我得到的那卷普鲁塔克的《名人传》，写的是古代共和国最早的创始人的历史。这本书对我的影响远远不同于《少年维特的烦恼》。我从维特的想象中了解到的是消沉和阴郁，而普鲁塔克却教给我崇高的思想。他使我超越了有关自己思绪的可怜的范围，而去崇敬爱戴往昔时代的英雄们。我所读到的许多事物都超过了我的想象力和经验。对于王国，辽阔的疆土，巨大的河流，无边的海洋，我只有一些混淆不清的知识。至于城市和大量密集的人口，我更是一无所知了。我的保护者的小屋一直就是我学习人类天性的唯一学校，可是这本书却展示出全新的、更为宏大有力的人类活动场景。我读到许多卷入公共事务的人物，他们管理或者屠杀自己的同类。我感到心中升腾起对美德的巨大热情和对邪恶的憎恶，就我对这两个词的理解，尽管它们的含义是相对的，我却把它们只当作欢乐和痛苦的意思来使用。受这些感情的引导，我当然就会敬仰努马、梭伦和卢克古斯这些和平的立法者，而不喜欢罗慕路斯和泰修乌斯了。(2)我的保护者一家的族长制式的生活方式也使这种见解在我心里扎了根，假如我接触人类的第一个人是个渴望荣誉和杀人的年轻士兵，或许我就会感染上不同的感情了。

“然而《失乐园》所激起的感情又不相同，而且更为深刻。我读它的时候，就和我读其他两本落入我手中的书一样，把它当作了真正的历史。全能的上帝和他的创造物之间激战的情景，最大限度地引起了我全部的惊奇和敬畏之情。我时常把某些场景用来和我的境况相比较，因为它们的相似性令我惊讶不已。我就像亚当，和世上的任何生命都毫无联系，不过就其他各个方面来看，他的情况和我又极不相同。他是经上帝之手诞生的完美的创造物，既快乐又幸运，受到他的创造者的特别呵护，允许他和更高级的生灵交谈，向他们取得知识，而我却是悲惨的，孤立无援，形只影单。有很多次，我觉得撒旦就是我的境况的恰当象征，因为我就像他一样，在见到我的保护者得到幸福的时候，心里常常产生怨恨的嫉妒。

“另一件事加强和坚定了我的这些感情。我住进窝棚后不久，在我离开你的实验室时拿走的衣服的口袋里，我发现了一些纸。开始时我并没有留意它们，现在既然我能够读懂那上面写的字了，我便开始努力研究起来。那是你在把我创造出来之前四个月里写的日记。你在这些纸上详细地描述了你的每一步工作进展，这段记载中还混杂着对于你的家事的叙述。你无疑想起了这些纸片吧，它们就在这里。一切关于我那可诅咒的起源的情况都记录在里面，创造我的一系列令人作呕的细节都展现在眼前，对我这引人憎恶的形象给予了最详尽的描写，所用的语言不仅刻画出了你的惧怕，也使我自己陷于不可磨灭的恐惧之中。我一面读一面感到厌恶。‘我获得生命的那个可憎的日子啊！’我痛苦地高叫道，‘该诅咒的创造者！你为什么要创造一个丑陋得连你自己也要厌恶的怪物啊？上帝出于慈悲而照着他的模样把人创造得美丽迷人，然而我的形象却是你的形象的龌龊的翻版，并且因为十分相似而更令人毛骨悚然。撒旦还有他的同伴，有他的魔鬼朋友来赞赏和鼓励他，可我却是茕茕孑立，遭人憎恶。’

“这些就是我在沮丧和孤独的时刻心里的想法。不过，当我思考着小屋主人们的美德和他们和蔼慈祥的性情时，我又劝说自己相信，只要他们知道我敬仰他们的美德，就会同情我而不再留意我的丑陋。不管我相貌如何怪异可怕，难道他们会把一个恳求他们的同情和友谊的人赶出门外吗？我决定，至少不能绝望，要为这一次决定命运的会见做好自己的一切准备。我把这次尝试推迟了几个月，因为它的成败关系重大，我唯恐会失败。此外，我发现随着自己每天经验的增进，我的理解力也大大提高了，所以我宁愿再等几个月，待智慧有所增长时才开始做这件事情。

“就在这段时间，小屋里发生了一些变化。沙菲的出现使家中充满了欢乐，我也发现他们的境况有了较大的改善。费利克斯和阿加莎把更多的时间花在了娱乐和谈话上，工作中也有仆人来协助他们。他们看来并不富有，但他们满足而幸福，他们的情感宁静而平和，而我的情感却一天天变得更加骚乱。知识的增长只是使我更清楚地看到自己是个何等可怜的弃儿。我曾怀抱着希望，的确如此，可是当我看见自己在水中的倒影或者在月光下的影子的时候，希望就幻灭了，就像那水中月下的脆弱影像和飘忽阴影一样。

“我竭力要消除这些恐惧，使自己坚强起来，去迎接几个月后决心接受的考验。有时候，我听凭思绪摆脱理智的约束，让它漫游在天堂的原野里，而且大胆地幻想有亲切可爱的生灵与我的感情共鸣，让我的阴郁化为欢乐，她们天使般的面容上流露着抚慰的微笑。可是这一切都是一场梦，并没有夏娃(3)来抚慰我的忧伤，或者分担我的思虑，我形只影单。我想起了亚当对他的创造者的祈求。然而我的创造者在哪里？他抛弃了我，在心灵的痛楚中，我诅咒他。

“秋天就这样消逝了。我怀着惊奇和忧愁，看着树叶凋零和飘落，大自然又和我第一次看见树林和月亮时那样，再度呈现出荒芜凄凉的面貌。不过我并不在意天气的凄冷，我的身体组织更适于抵御寒冷而不耐炎热。只不过我最大的赏心乐事是看到花儿、鸟儿以及夏天的欢乐景象，当它们离我而去以后，我便把更多的注意力转移到了小屋主人身上。他们的快乐并没有因为夏天的消逝而减少。他们相爱着，彼此情感相通，他们的欢乐依赖于相互间的关系，并不因周围环境发生事变而受到惊扰。我越是看着他们，就越是渴望得到他们的保护和关怀。我的心渴求着让这些可爱的人知道我和爱我，我最大的奢望便是看到他们用慈爱的目光瞧着我。我不敢设想他们会轻蔑而恐惧地逃避我。就是站在他们门前乞讨的穷人也绝没有被他们赶走过。是的，我所要求的东西是比一点食物和一夜寄宿更为巨大的珍宝，我要求得到的是关切和同情，但我并不相信我不配得到它。

“冬季在一天天过去。自我获得生命以来，一年四季已经完成了一个周期。到这时候，我的整个注意力都集中于考虑自己如何进入我的保护者的屋子。我订了许多方案，不过我最后确定的方案是，等到失明的老人单独在家的时候再进屋。我有足够的自知之明，知道原先见到我的那些人，主要是因为我这反常的可怕形象而大为惊骇。我的声音尽管刺耳，倒也没有什么可怕之处，因此我想，只要孩子们不在家，我便能博得德·拉舍老人的好感，争取以他为媒介，让那些年轻的保护者也能容忍我。

“一天，阳光照耀在洒满红叶的地上，烘染出欢快的气氛，虽然这并不足以使人感到温暖，沙菲、阿加莎和费利克斯出门去做一次乡间的远足，老人自愿单独待在家里。当孩子们离开后，他拿起了吉他，弹奏了几支哀伤而甜美的乐曲，胜过了过去我听他弹奏过的任何曲子。一开始他的面容因快乐而泛起了光彩，可是当他继续弹奏下去时，思虑和伤感便接踵而至，最后，他把乐器放到了一边，坐在那儿陷入了沉思。

“我的心疾速地跳动着，考验的时刻来到了，它将实现我的希望，或者证实我的担忧。仆人到邻近的一个集市上去了。小屋里里外外是一片寂静，这是极好的机会。可是当我接着要实行自己的计划时，我却四肢无力，倒在了地上。我重新站起来，我竭尽全力使自己坚定些，移开了放在窝棚前遮掩自己的木板。清新的空气使我振作起来，于是我怀着再度确立的决心，向小屋的门前走去。

“我敲了敲门。‘是谁啊？’老人问道，‘进来吧。’

“我进去了。‘请原谅我的打扰，’我说，‘我是个旅行者，需要休息一会儿。如果你允许我在炉火边待几分钟，我将十分感激。’

“‘来吧，’德·拉舍说，‘我乐意满足你的需要，不过很不巧，我的孩子们不在家，而我又双目失明，恐怕不能给你准备食物了。’

“‘不用麻烦了，我好心的主人，我有食物，我需要的只是温暖和休息。’

“我坐下来，接着是一阵沉默。我明白每一分钟对我来说都是宝贵的，然而我犹豫不决，不知道应该用什么方式开始这场谈话。这时候老人向我说道：

“‘听你的语言，陌生人，我猜想你是我的同胞；——你是法国人吧？’

“‘不，不过我是在一个法国家庭里受的教育，我只懂法语。我现在正要请求一些朋友的保护，我真诚地爱他们，我希望得到他们的恩惠。’

“‘他们是德国人吗？’

“‘不，他们是法国人。不过让我们换个话题吧。我是个不幸的、被抛弃的人，我举目四望，在世上既没有一个亲戚，也没有一个朋友。我要投奔的那些可爱的朋友从未见过我，也丝毫不了解我。我心里充满了忧虑，因为假如我失败了，我在世界上就永远是个被抛弃的人了。’

“‘不要绝望。没有朋友的确是不幸的，不过只要人们的心未因明显的私利而导致偏见，总是充满博爱和慈善的。所以，要坚信你的希望，如果那些朋友们是善良友好的，就不要绝望。’

“‘他们是善良的——他们是世界上最优秀的人，但是很不幸，他们正是对我抱有偏见。我具有善良的性格，我的一生至今为止无害于人，而且在某种程度上还是有益于人的，可是致命的偏见蒙住了他们的眼睛，他们本应看到我是一个富有同情心的、慈爱的朋友，却将我仅仅视为一个可憎的怪物。’

“‘这确实很不幸，不过假如你真的是无可责难的话，难道你就不能消除他们的偏见吗？’

“‘我正准备这样做，可是正因为这个缘故，我才感到如此恐惧不安。我深情地爱着这些朋友，好几个月以来，我一直在他们不知道的情况下经常为他们做些好事，可是他们却认为我是想伤害他们，我希望克服的正是这种偏见。’

“‘这些朋友住在哪里？’

“‘就在这附近。’

“老人沉默了一阵，然后继续说：‘如果你愿意毫无保留地把你的详细情况告诉我，也许我可以帮助你来消除他们的偏见。我双目失明，不能判断你的相貌如何，不过你的话使我相信你是真诚的。我很穷，而且是个流亡者，可是不管以什么方式，能为一个人做点好事，会让我得到真正的快乐。’

“‘你真是好人！我感谢你，我接受你慷慨的建议。是你的好心把我从困境里救了出来，我相信，有了你的帮助，我就不会被驱逐出社会，被排除在你的同胞们的同情心之外了。’

“‘上天不容如此！就算你真是一个罪犯，他们这样做只会使你绝望，而不会激励你向善。我自己也是不幸的，我和我的家人也被判了罪，尽管是无辜的，因此你可以判断，我是否会对你的不幸无动于衷。’

“‘我该怎么感谢你呢，我最好的、唯一的恩人？从你的口里，我才第一次听到对我表示好意的话语，我将永远怀着感激。你现在的仁慈使我确信，即将见面的朋友是会善待我的。’

“‘我可以知道你那些朋友的姓名和住址吗？’

“我沉默了。我想，决定性的时刻到了，或者永远剥夺我的快乐，或者永远使我幸福。我挣扎着，想保持足够的镇定来回答他的问题，但我办不到，这番努力反而摧毁了我剩余的力量，我倒在椅子上，大声啜泣起来。就在这个时候，我听见我的年轻保护者们的脚步声。我不能错过这千钧一发的时刻，我抓住老人的手，高声叫道：‘现在到时候了！——救救我，保护我！你和你的家人就是我要寻找的朋友。在这关键时刻不要抛弃我！’

“‘天啊！’老人叫道，‘你是谁？’

“门就在这一瞬刻打开了，费利克斯、沙菲和阿加莎走了进来。谁能描述他们在见到我的时候所表现出的恐惧和惊骇呢？阿加莎晕了过去，沙菲顾不得照看她的朋友，冲出了屋外。费利克斯向前扑过来，用超人的力量把我从他父亲身边拉开，那时我正紧抱着他父亲的双膝，他在一阵激怒中把我推倒在地，并用一根棍子狠狠地打我。我本来可以像狮子对付羚羊那样把他的肢体撕裂。可是我的心仿佛因剧烈痛楚而变得衰弱，便克制住了自己。我看到他还要继续打我，只好带着满身伤痛和满腔苦恼逃出小屋，在一片骚乱里偷偷潜回了我的窝棚。”

第十六章　走上复仇之路


“可诅咒的，可诅咒的创造者！我为什么要活着？我为什么不在那一瞬刻把你如此随意赐予我的生命之火扑灭？我也不知道，绝望尚未完全控制我，当时主宰着我的情绪是暴怒和报复。我本来会逞一时快意毁灭那所屋子和它的住户，用他们的尖叫声和惨状来满足自己。

“夜晚来临时，我离开了窝棚，到树林里去漫游。现在，我不再担心被人发现而克制自己，我用可怕的嚎叫来发泄内心的痛苦。我就像一头冲出陷阱的野兽，毁坏着一切阻挡着我的东西，以牡鹿般的快捷在树林间乱跑。啊！我度过的是怎样一个不幸的夜晚啊！清冷的月光嘲弄似的照着我，光秃秃的树在我头顶上摇晃着枝丫，不时有一只鸟的甜美鸣叫声打破那无边的寂静。除了我，万物都在休憩或者独享其乐，而我，就像那个大魔王(1)一样，心里装着一座地狱，我得不到任何同情，真想把树木都连根拔起，在我周围制造一场大破坏和大灾难，然后坐下来欣赏那一片废墟。

“不过，这是一阵不能持久的狂暴感情，我因为身体过度劳累而精疲力竭，在绝望的衰弱中倒在了潮湿的草地上。在千万个人当中，竟没有一个来可怜我或者帮助我，难道我应该对我的仇敌们仁慈吗？不，从那一刻起，我宣布自己要永远与人类为敌，而且首先与那个人为敌，是他创造了我，把我打发到这种不堪忍受的苦难中来。

“太阳升起了，我听见人的声音，知道自己那个白天是不能回到住所去了。因此，我就躲到茂密的树林下层去，决定用接下来的时间好好考虑自己的处境。

“白天那令人愉快的阳光和清新的空气使我多少恢复了平静。当我考虑在小屋里发生的那幕情景时，我不能不相信自己的结论未免下得过早了些。我的行动显然过分鲁莽。很明显，我的谈话已经使那个父亲对我产生了好感，而我简直是个傻瓜，竟在他们面前暴露自己而引起他们的恐惧。我应该先让德·拉舍老人尽量熟悉我，然后再一步步地在他家的其余人跟前露面，那时他们对我就已经有了思想准备了。不过，我并不认为我的错误是无法弥补的，经过仔细考虑以后，我决定回到小屋去，找到那个老人，用我的陈述来争取他的同情。

“这些想法使我平静下来了，下午我昏沉沉地睡去，可是我的血液就像染了热病似的，让我不能进入安宁的梦境。前一天那可怕的景象一直在我眼前活生生地搬演着：女人们飞奔而逃，激怒的费利克斯把我从他父亲脚旁扯开。我精疲力竭地醒来，发现已经天黑了，便从藏身处爬出来，去寻找食物。

“当饥饿得到缓解以后，我就迈步向通往小屋的那条熟悉的小路走去。周围是一派寂静。我爬进窝棚，静静地等待着那一家人平常起床的时刻。那个时刻过去了，太阳也在天空高高升起了，可是屋里的人还没有出现。我剧烈地发起抖来，担心是不是发生了什么可怕的灾祸。小屋里黑沉沉的，听不到任何声响，我无法形容这种提心吊胆的痛苦。

“不久，有两个村民走过来了，他们在小屋附近停下，谈起话来，一边激烈地做着手势，但我听不懂他们说些什么，因为他们讲的是本国的语言，和我的保护者的语言不同。不过，费利克斯和另一个人很快也走过来了。我觉得奇怪，因为那天早晨我并没有见到他离开屋子，于是我急切地等待着，想从他的谈话中弄清这不寻常的情况到底意味着什么。

“‘你考虑过没有，’和他同来的人问道，‘你必须交三个月的房租，还要损失你菜园的收成？我不想占你的便宜，因此我请你对自己的决定再考虑几天。’

“‘完全没有必要，’费利克斯答道，‘我们不能再在你的屋子里住下去了。由于我给你讲过的那种可怕的情况，我父亲的生命已危在旦夕。我妻子和姐姐也无法从恐惧中恢复过来了。我请求你不要再劝说我了。收回你的房子，让我们逃离这个地方吧。’

“费利克斯在说这番话的时候，还在剧烈地颤抖着。他和他的同伴进了屋子，在里面待了几分钟，然后就离开了。从此，我就再也没有见过德·拉舍一家了。

“我待在窝棚里，在彻底的、麻木的绝望状态中度过了那天的剩余时间。我的保护者们已经离去了，从而断绝了我跟这个世界之间的唯一的联系。报复和憎恨的情绪第一次涌满了我胸膛，而且我并不试图抑制它，我听凭自己被这股情绪之流推动着，一心一意地要想进行伤害和杀戮。当我想到我的朋友们，想到德·拉舍那温和的声音，阿加莎那温柔的眼睛，阿拉伯女子那高雅的美丽，这些念头就消失了，喷涌的泪水使我稍获安慰。可是，当我回想起他们蔑视了我，抛弃了我，又感到愤怒，怒火又重新燃起，因为不能对任何人实施伤害，我便把怒火发泄到无生命的东西上。在夜色渐浓的时候，我在小屋周围堆上了各种易燃物，把菜园毁坏得面目全非，然后强压着耐性等待着月亮落下后开始行动。

“夜色愈浓，一阵猛烈的风从树林那边吹过来，很快驱散了飘荡在天上的云朵，疾风以排山倒海之势狂扫猛进，使我的精神产生了一种疯狂的劲头，突破了理智和思想的一切限制。我点燃了一棵树的干枝丫，围绕着那可爱的小屋狂怒地跳起舞来，我的眼睛仍然紧盯着西方的地平线，月亮差不多接触到了它的边缘。那个圆盘的一部分终于落下去了，我挥舞起手中的火把，月亮沉落了，我一声大叫，点燃了稻草，以及我收集来的石南枝和灌木条。风扇起了烈焰，小屋很快就被裹在了烈火中，火苗紧抓住它，用它那分叉的、毁灭一切的舌头舔着它。

“当我确信没有任何援助可以挽救屋子的任何部分时，便离开了火场，到树林里找栖身之地去了。

“现在，面对这个世界，我应当走向何处呢？我决定远离这个不幸的地方，可是对于被憎恨和被鄙视的我来说，任何国家都是一样的可怕。终于，我一下想到了你。我从你的那些纸片里了解到，你就是我的父亲，我的创造者，除了给予我生命的那个人以外，我向谁求援更合适呢？在费利克斯给沙菲讲授的课程中，地理并没有被省略。我从这些课程里了解了地球上不同国家的相对位置。你曾经提到过日内瓦是你的故乡；我决定到这个地方去。

“不过，我朝什么方向走呢？我明白必须往西南方走才能到达目的地，只有太阳作我的唯一向导。我不知道自己将经过的那些市镇叫什么名字，我也不能向任何人打听情况，但是我并不绝望。我只有在你那里才能得到拯救，尽管我对你并无任何感情，有的只是憎恨。无情的、残忍的创造者！你赋予我知觉和感情，然后就把我扔开，让我成为人类轻蔑和惧怕的对象。然而只有对你，我才有权利要求得到怜悯和补偿，对你，我决心要讨回公道，这是我从任何具有人形的生灵那里都无法得到的。

“我的旅程十分漫长，我所受的痛苦更是剧烈的。当我离开自己住了那么长时间的地方时，时令已是深秋。我只有在夜间赶路，唯恐见到一个人影。大自然在我周围日益凋败，太阳变得毫无热力，雨雪倾注在我身上，巨川大河也结了冰，地面变得坚硬、寒冷、荒芜，我找不到任何挡风避雨的处所。啊，大地！我多少次诅咒自己生命的起源！我天性中的温顺已经消失殆尽，心里只剩下恶意和狠毒。我越是接近你的家门，便越是深感复仇之火在心里燃烧。大雪纷飞，江河冰冻，可是我一刻也不停息。间或有一些偶然的事情给我指明前进的方向，而且我也有一张这个国家的地图，不过我还是经常大大偏离正确的道路。感情的剧痛催促我不敢稍微歇息，我在路上遇见的事，没有一件不是使我的愤怒和悲伤变得更强烈的。当我踏上瑞士的疆界，太阳又重新变暖，大地看上去又是绿油油的了，但就在这时发生了一件事，使我的感情变得特别怨愤和可怕。

“一般情况下，我是白天休息，只在夜晚人们确实看不见我的时候才赶路。可是在一天早晨，我发现我的道路将穿过一片幽深的树林，于是我就冒险在太阳升起以后继续行走。那是早春的一天，阳光的和煦，空气的清香，甚至使我也感到兴致勃勃。我觉得早已死亡了的温柔欢乐的感情又在心中复苏了。这种新奇的感觉让我有几分惊讶，我便听凭自己陶醉于这种情感，忘却了自己的孤独和丑陋，竟然高兴起来。柔情之泪沾湿了脸颊，我甚至抬起了湿润的眼睛来看神圣的太阳，感激它赐予我如此的欢乐。

“我继续沿着林间小径曲折地前行，一直到了树林的边缘，那里围绕着一条水深流急的河流，许多树木初春新发的嫩枝条弯弯地插在河水中。走到这儿我停住了，不知道该走哪条路，这时我突然听见了人的声音，就躲到一棵柏树的阴影里藏了起来。我刚藏好，就有一个姑娘朝我的藏身处跑过来，她还大声笑着，好像是在玩游戏躲着什么人。她沿着陡峭的河岸一直跑，突然脚下一滑，落进了湍急的流水中。我从藏身处冲出来，竭尽力气顶住激流救起了她，把她拖到了岸边。她失去了知觉，我用尽力所能及的办法想让她苏醒过来。就在这时，我的努力因为一个乡下人的突然逼近而中断了，他也许就是姑娘开玩笑要躲避的那个人。他一看见我就猛扑上来，从我手臂里夺走了姑娘，急忙向树林的深处跑去。我不知怎么的，很快地跟了上去，可是那个人看我走近了，就举起随身携带的一支枪朝我瞄准，开了火。我倒在地上，而伤害我的人却加快速度逃进了树林。

“这就是对我的仁慈的报偿！我从毁灭中救起了一个人，作为报答，现在我却因为皮开肉绽的枪伤而痛苦得在地上翻滚。几分钟之前我怀着仁慈而温柔的感情，现在已让位于恶魔似的狂怒和咬牙切齿地愤恨了。我被痛苦点燃了怒火，立誓要永远仇恨人类，报复人类。不过，伤口的剧痛压倒了我，我的脉搏停止了跳动，我晕过去了。

“好几个礼拜里，我在树林里过着悲惨的生活，尽力养好我受的枪伤。枪弹打进了我的肩膀，我也不知道它是留在了里面，还是穿过去了，不管怎样，我没有办法把它取出来。我强烈地感到人类的伤害是不公正的和忘恩负义的，这更增加了我的痛苦。我的报复之心日益强烈——要进行深重致命的报复，方足以补偿我所遭受的蹂躏和痛楚。

“几个月以后，我的枪伤痊愈了，于是我又继续我的旅程。我的劳累再也不会因明媚的阳光和温柔的春风而减轻了，一切欢乐只是对我的嘲弄，它对我的凄凉处境加以侮辱，使我更痛苦地感到我生来是不配享受欢乐的。

“不过我的艰难跋涉现在快到终点了。两个月后我抵达了日内瓦的近郊。

“到那里的时候是傍晚时分，我躲进郊外田野中的一个藏身处，考虑怎样向你提出要求。我受到疲惫和饥饿的逼迫，心情也极不痛快，远不能欣赏黄昏的和风，或者巍峨的尤拉山后日落的景观。

“这时我小睡了片刻，使我解脱那思虑之苦，却又被惊醒了，那是一个漂亮的小孩，他带着充满稚气的活泼劲儿朝我的藏身地跑来。在我注视着他的时候，突然有个念头攫住了我：这个小生命是没有偏见的，而且他出世不久，对丑陋也不至于恐惧。因此，如果我能抓住他，教育他作我的同伴和朋友，那么我在这个住满人类的地球上就不那么凄凉了。

“被这种冲动所激励，我在孩子走过的时候一把抓住了他，把他拖到身边来。他一见我的模样，就用手蒙住眼睛，发出了一声尖叫。我用力拉开他蒙在脸上的手，说道：‘孩子，你这是干什么？我无意伤害你，你听我说。’

“他猛烈地挣扎着。‘放开我，’他叫道，‘妖怪！丑八怪！你想吃掉我，把我撕碎——你是个吃人魔——放开我，不然我就要告诉爸爸。’

“‘孩子，你再也见不到你父亲了，你得跟我走。’

“‘丑妖怪！放开我。我爸爸是市政官——他是弗兰肯斯坦先生——他会惩罚你。你不敢不放我。’

“‘弗兰肯斯坦！那你是我的仇敌家的人了——我发誓要永远向他复仇，你正好是我的第一个牺牲品。’

“那孩子仍然在挣扎，同时用难听的名称大肆谩骂我，使我深感绝望。我掐住他的喉咙不让他再骂，瞬刻之间他就死在了我的脚下。

“我注视着我的牺牲者，心里充满了狂喜和恶魔般的扬扬得意。我拍着手，大声叫道：‘我，也能制造不幸，我的敌人也并非不可伤害的，这次死亡将给他带来绝望，还将有成千的苦难来折磨他和摧毁他。’

“当我紧盯着那个孩子时，看到有个东西在他胸前闪亮。我取下了它，那是一个极可爱的女子的肖像。不管我怎么狠毒，它仍然使我的心变得柔和并受到吸引。我欣喜地看了一会儿，凝视着她那黑黑的眼睛，眼睛周围浓密的睫毛，和那可爱的嘴唇。可是我的怒火随即又燃起了，我想起自己已被永远剥夺了如此美丽的生灵所能给予的欢乐，而且像上所画的女子假如看见了我，也会将她圣洁的温柔表情换为极度的厌恶和恐惧啊。

“这些想法竟会使我怒火万丈，难道你会觉得奇怪吗？我只是奇怪，在那个时刻我为什么没有冲到人类中去，毁灭他们，也毁掉自己，而只是以高声呼叫和痛苦挣扎来发泄我的感情。

“我被这些感情控制着，离开了杀人的现场。在寻找更隐蔽的藏身处时，我进了一个似乎是空着的谷仓。有个女子躺在草堆上睡觉，她很年轻，的确没有我手中肖像上的那个女人长得美，不过相貌也很逗人喜欢，而且青春焕发，健康可爱。我想，这里又有一个人，她那令人欢悦的微笑是给所有人的，唯独不给我。于是我俯在她的耳边悄声说：‘醒来吧，最美的姑娘，你的情人来啦——能让你深情地看上一眼，他宁愿献出生命，我亲爱的，醒来吧！’

“睡着的姑娘动了动，一阵恐惧袭遍了我的周身。如果她醒来，会不会看见我，咒骂我，斥责我是杀人凶手呢？一旦她闭着的眼睛睁开来看见我的话，肯定是会这样做的。这样一想就使我疯狂了，它唤起了我心中的魔鬼——受苦的不该是我，应该是她。我杀人是因为我被永远剥夺了她所能给予的快乐，这应由她来偿付代价。犯罪的根源在她身上，让她受到惩罚！多亏了费利克斯讲的课程和人类血淋淋的法律，我现在学会了阴谋陷害。我向她俯下身子，把那幅肖像稳稳当当地放在她衣服的一处褶皱里。她又动了动，于是我就逃走了。

“接连好几天，我都在发生这些事情的地方徘徊。有时候，我希望见到你，有时候我又下定决心永远离开这个世界和它的苦难。最后，我向这一片群山走来，在深谷巨洞里游荡，被一种燃烧的热望折磨着，而这种欲望只有你能够满足。你不答应我的要求，我们就绝不分手。我形只影单，十分可怜。人类不愿和我交往，可是，一个和我同样丑陋可憎的异性总不会拒绝我吧。我的伴侣应该是我的同类，应该有同样的缺陷。你必须创造出这个生命。”

第十七章　最后的要求


那个有灵之物讲完了，紧盯着我，期待我的回答。而我却感到困惑和茫然，无法理清思绪来理解他的建议的全部含义。他又接着说——“你必须为我创造出一个女性，和我一起生活，彼此交流我必不可少的同情。这只有你才能做得到。我有权来要求你这样做，你不能拒绝。”

在他叙述他在小屋主人当中度过的那段平静生活的时候，我的愤怒已渐渐平息，可是他故事的后半部分又重新激起了我的怒气，当他说到这里时，我再也无法抑制在心里燃烧的怒火了。

“我就是要拒绝你，”我回答道，“无论受怎样的折磨，也不能迫使我答应你。你可以使我成为世上最不幸的人，可是你绝不能使我做自己也瞧不起自己的事情。难道我会再造出一个你这样的东西，让你们狼狈为奸搞垮这个世界吗？滚开！我已经回答了你，你可以折磨我，但是我绝不会答应。”

“你错了，”那个魔鬼回答说，“我不想威胁你，只要同你讲讲道理就满足了。我狠毒是因为我不幸。难道我不是被整个人类所回避和憎恨吗？你，我的创造者，也想把我撕得粉碎而后快啊。请你记住这一点，并且告诉我，为什么我应该可怜那些并不可怜我的人呢？假如你把我推进冰缝里，毁掉你亲手创造的这个躯体，你是不会把这个行为称作谋杀的。难道有人轻蔑我，我反倒要尊重他吗？如果他和我在相互关怀中一起生活，那我不仅不会伤害他，反而会对他的接纳感激涕零，为他做一切好事。不过这是不可能的，人类的观念是阻止我们结合的难以逾越的障碍。然而我的观念也并非甘愿忍受卑鄙的奴役。我要为自己所受的伤害复仇。如果我不能唤起爱，我就制造恐惧。首先是针对你，我的头号仇敌，因为你是我的创造者，我对你怀有不可消除的仇恨。你当心，我将慢慢地让你毁灭，不到你伤心欲绝我不会住手，我要让你诅咒你降生到这个世上来的那个时刻。”

他说到这里，魔鬼似的怒火使他兴奋若狂，他的脸皱缩歪扭得如此可怕，使人不敢看上一眼。不过他马上就镇静下来了，接着说下去：“我是打算讲道理的。这种激怒对我是不利的，因为你并没有想过，你本人正是我这种激怒的根源。只要有任何人对我怀有仁慈之情，我将千百倍地报答他，只因为这一个人的缘故，我就愿意和整个人类讲和！可是，我现在只不过是沉溺于不可能实现的美梦之中罢了。我向你提出的要求很合理，也并不过分。我要求有一个异性的伴侣，只不过要和我一样丑陋。这种满足真是微不足道，但它就是我能得到的全部东西，而且仅此就将使我满意。不错，我们将是与世隔绝的一对怪物，不过正因为这样，我们将更加相亲相爱。我们的生活不会很快活，但是于他人无害，也不会承受我现在所经受的痛苦。啊！我的创造者，给我幸福吧，让我因你做的这一件好事而感恩戴德吧！让我看到我自己能够激起某个生灵的感情共鸣吧，不要拒绝我的请求！”

我被感动了。但当我想到一旦应允可能会有怎样的结果时，却又不寒而栗，不过我觉得他的话也有几分道理。他的故事，他目前表现出来的感情，都证明他是一个具有细腻情感的生命，而我作为他的创造者，难道不应该把我所能给予的那份快乐给予他吗？他看出了我的感情变化，便接着说：“如果你同意了，无论是你还是其他人，都永远不会再见到我们了，我将到茫茫无边的南美洲荒原去。我的食物和人类的不同，我不会杀死羔羊或小山羊来满足食欲，橡实和浆果就可以给我提供足够的营养了。我的伴侣会具有与我相同的属性，同样的食物也可以满足她。我们将用干树叶来铺床，太阳将像照耀人类那样照耀着我们，并催熟我们的食物。我给你描绘的这幅图景是和平的、符合人性的，你一定会感到，如果拒绝我，那只是滥用权力和横施暴虐而已。尽管你一直对我毫无怜悯，可是现在我在你的眼里看到了同情，让我抓住这有利的瞬刻，说服你允诺赐给我如此热烈渴望的伴侣吧。”

“你提议，”我答道，“远离人类居住的地方，到只有野兽做伴的荒野去定居。可是你一直渴望人类的爱和同情，又怎么能够在这种放逐生活中坚持下去呢？你会回来的，再次寻求人类的关怀，并再遭到他们的厌恶，你那邪恶的怒火又将燃起，而且你那时将有个同伙帮助你施行破坏。这可不成，不要再争辩这个问题了，因为我不可能同意。”

“你的感情是多么的反复无常啊！在片刻之前，你还被我的请求所感动，怎么又硬起心肠对我的申诉无动于衷了呢？我以我居住的地球起誓，以创造了我自己的你起誓，我将和你赐予的伴侣一道，离开人类的周围，到任何一个最蛮荒的地方去生活。我的邪恶感情将会荡然无存，因为我将获得同情！我的生命将安安静静地流逝，而且即使在死亡的那一刻，我也不会诅咒我的创造者。”

他的话在我心上产生了一种奇怪的效果。我同情他，有时甚至感到有安慰他的愿望，可是当我看着他，当我看见那个污秽的躯体动来动去和说着话的时候，不禁感到恶心，而我的同情也就变为了恐惧和憎恶。我竭力去抑制这些感情，我想，既然自己不能同情他，也就没有权力去阻止他获得我尚有力量给予他的那一点快乐。

“你起誓，”我说，“不再为害，可是你难道不是已经显示出了某种狠毒，使我有理由不相信你吗？这难道不会是一种伪装，以便进行更大的报复，从而使更大的阴谋得逞吗？”

“这是怎么讲？我可不是好作弄的，我要求你答复我。假如我与人没有联系，没有感情，给我留下的就只有仇恨和邪恶了，另一个人的爱则可以摧毁我的罪恶的根源，同时我也可以销声匿迹，谁也不知道我的存在了。我的罪恶是一种强加给我的、连我自己也厌恶的孤独状态的产物，当我跟我的一个同类和谐生活的时候，美德就必然会从我的内心生成。我将感受到另一个敏感生命的爱，并成为连接到生存事变的锁链中的一个环节，而现在我是被排斥在外的。”

我沉默了一会儿，掂量着他所说的一切和他提出的各种论证。我想到，他在生命开始时也曾显示出富于美德的前景，后来因为他的保护者表示出了厌恶和轻蔑，这一切善良情感便受到了摧残。我在仔细考虑的时候也没有忽略他的力量和他的威胁：一个生物既然能够在雪原冰窟里生存，在高不可攀的悬崖峭壁上逃避追击，那一定具有无法对抗的能力。经过了长时间的思考，我得出了结论，无论是对于他或是我的同胞都要不失公正，我有责任答应他的要求。因此，我朝他转过身去，说道：“我同意你的要求，但你要庄严地起誓，一旦我交给你一个女性陪伴你去流放，你就要永远离开欧洲，以及其他接近人类的任何地方。”

“我凭着太阳，凭着蓝天，凭着燃烧着我的心的爱火起誓，”他高叫道，“如果你答应了我的请求，只要它们还存在，你就永远再见不到我了。回家去吧，开始你的工作，我会以无法言说的焦急心情关注着你的进展，在你完成之前，不要担心我会出现。”

他一边说着，一边就突然离开了我，或许是害怕我的想法会有什么改变。我望着他下山，真比老鹰飞翔的速度还快，即刻就消失在起伏不平的冰海里了。

他的故事讲了一整天，在他离去的时候，太阳已经落到地平线的边缘了。我知道自己必须尽快赶回下面的山谷中去，因为黑夜不久就会包围我，可是我的心情沉重，步伐很缓慢。白天发生的事所激起的情感充塞着我的心，我费力地在山间曲折小路上走着，极力一步步走稳，思绪纠缠不清。我走到半途歇脚的地方，在泉水边坐下的时候，夜色已深。星光时隐时现，因为浮云在它们前面飘过，黑黝黝的松林耸立在我面前，地上疏疏落落躺着断裂的树干，这是一幅奇妙而庄严的景象，它在我心中激起了许多奇怪的思绪。我苦涩地哭起来，我痛苦地紧握着双手，高声喊叫：“啊！星星，云彩，风啊，你们都来嘲笑我吗？要是你们真的可怜我，就把我的感觉和记忆毁掉吧，让我化为乌有吧，如果不，就走开，走开，让我留在黑暗里好了。”

这都是些狂乱而伤心的思绪，不过我没法向你形容星星那永恒的闪光怎么重压着我，我是怎样倾听着那疾风一阵阵呼号，仿佛是热带沉闷阴郁的怪风正要吹来吞没我似的。

我到天亮以后才回到萨姆尼村，我没有歇口气，马上就回了日内瓦。甚至在自己心里，我也说不清那复杂的感受——它们像大山一样沉重地压着我，过分巨大的重量压碎了我的痛苦。我就这样往家里走，进了家门，出现在家人面前。我那憔悴而狂乱的样子引起了大家的惊恐，可是我什么也不回答，几乎不说一句话。我觉得自己仿佛处于一种禁令之下——仿佛我没有权利要求大家的同情——仿佛我再不能和大家亲密相处。不过甚至在这种情况下我仍然深爱着他们，为了救他们，我决心把自己献给我最厌恨的工作。这种工作的前景摆在眼前，其他种种生活事项便都像梦幻一样地消逝了，对于我来说，只有考虑这个工作才是生活的现实。





第十八章　前往英国


我回到日内瓦以后，一天又一天，一周又一周，时间就这样过去了，可是我一直鼓不起勇气来开始我的工作。我担心失望的魔鬼会来报复，但我又不能克服对强加于我的这项工作的深恶痛绝。我发现，要制造一个女性，我非得再次耗费几个月做深入学习和刻苦研究不可。我听说一位英国科学家获得了某些发现，它们对我工作的成功极为重要，所以我有时候打算征得父亲的同意，为这一目的去英国访问。然而我又抓住每一个借口拖延行期，退缩着不肯跨出第一步，这便使得这项紧迫而必要的工作渐渐显得不那么要紧了。我自己的确也有了一些改变：我的健康本来一直在恶化，现在已经大大恢复了，当对那不愉快的诺言的记忆不再压抑我的时候，我的情绪也相应地高昂起来。父亲高兴地看到了这种变化，他集中心思要寻找最好的办法来根治我残余的忧郁情绪，这种情绪不时会一阵阵地发作，像吞食天空的乌云遮蔽住将要显露出的阳光。在这些时刻，我总是在绝对孤独中去寻找慰藉。我划着小船在湖上独自度过一整天，眺望浮云，倾听波浪的细语，默默无言，没精打采。不过，清新的空气和明媚的阳光也常常能使我在一定程度上恢复平静，当我回家的时候，面对家人的致意，我也能报以更欣然的笑容和比较愉快的心情了。

一次，在这样的漫游之后回到家里，父亲把我叫到旁边，对我这样说：“我很高兴地注意到，我亲爱的儿子，你已经重新获得了你从前的乐趣，而且看来正在恢复健康。可是你仍然郁郁不乐，而且在躲着我们。一段时间以来，我猜不透这是什么原因，但昨天我突然有了一个想法，如果这个想法确有根据，我请你坦率地承认。在这个问题上有所保留非但无用，而且会给我们大家带来三重的不幸。”

听到他这样的开场白，我浑身颤抖起来；父亲继续说下去：“我得承认，我的儿子，我一直盼望着你和我们亲爱的伊丽莎白结婚，这是我们家庭幸福的纽带，也是我风烛残年的依靠。你们在孩提时期就相依相伴，在一起学习，性格志趣彼此都完全投合。然而人的经验又是多么的盲目，我认为最有助于实现计划的做法却可能彻底破坏它。你，也许只把她看作妹妹，而并不希望她成为你的妻子。不仅如此，你也许遇见了另一个你可能爱上的女子，但你又考虑到自己对伊丽莎白负有道义上的责任，这种内心的斗争可能就使你感到了强烈的痛苦吧。”

“我亲爱的父亲，请你放心。我深情而真诚地爱着我的表妹。我从来没有遇见过任何女子，能像伊丽莎白那样激起我最强烈的爱慕和感情。我对未来的希望和憧憬，与对我们结合的期望是完全融为一体的。”

“我亲爱的维克多，在这个问题上你所表达的感情，使我感到了很长时间以来所未曾体验过的快乐。如果你是这样感受的，那么我们确实感到高兴，不管目前种种事变给我们投上怎样的阴影。不过正是这种阴影似乎已经牢牢控制了你的思想，而我希望能够驱散它。因此，请你告诉我，你是否同意马上举行婚礼。我们的生活很不幸，近来的一些事使我们失去了日常生活的宁静，而那又是年老体弱的我很需要的。你还年轻，可是我并不认为，像你这样大有前途的年轻人，早些结婚就会妨碍你实现未来追求光荣和事业的计划。不过，你不要认为我希望支配你的幸福，或者认为你推延婚期就会使我很不安。正确地理解我的话，并请你以信任和真诚之心来回答我。”

我默默地听着父亲的话，好长一段时间无法做出回答。我的心中千头万绪思潮翻滚，竭力想得出某种结论。唉！马上和伊丽莎白结婚，对我来说是一种令人恐惧和惊愕的想法。我还受着一项庄严诺言的约束，那项诺言我还没有履行，也不敢破坏，假如我破坏了它，有多少灾难将降临在我和我亲爱的家人头上啊！难道我能在脖子上戴着如此致命的、把我压得匍匐在地的枷锁，去举行婚礼的庆典吗？我必须先履行我的诺言，让怪物和他的伴侣离去，然后才能享受婚姻的快乐，从而得到我期望的和平生活。

我还想起自己必须做的事，或者到英国去一趟，或者和那个国家的科学家们长期通信，他们的知识和新发现对于我眼下的工作必不可少。通过后一种办法来获取我想要的资料，既费时，效果又不能令人满意。此外，在父亲的家里进行这桩讨厌的工作，一面还要和我所爱的家人每日亲密交往，这也使我感到不可克制的厌恶。我知道，有千百件可怕的意外事件可能发生，其中最轻微的也会使我的亲人们惊骇不已。我也明白，我常常会失去自我控制能力，无法掩饰我在进行这桩荒谬绝伦的工作期间所承受的剧烈痛苦。在进行这件事时，我必须远离自己所爱的一切人。工作一旦开始，就应该尽快完成，这样我就可以重新和家人过上和平快乐的日子了。我的诺言一旦兑现，怪物也就永远离去了。也许（我就这样想入非非），在此期间会发生什么意想不到的事情，把那怪物毁灭了，从而永远结束我受奴役的境况。

这些想法决定了我怎样回答父亲。我表示希望到英国去做一次访问，不过我隐瞒了真正的理由，以不致引起怀疑的借口掩饰了我的真实意愿，同时以诚挚的态度很容易地获得了父亲的首肯。在我这么长时期以来陷于忧郁，其深重程度几近于疯狂之后，父亲高兴地发现我竟能够对这样的旅行感兴趣，他希望环境的变化和多种多样的消遣能在我返回之前使我完全恢复健康。

离家多久由我自己决定。我考虑大概几个月，至多一年。父亲出于关怀，他还着手为我寻找一个旅伴。在事先没有告诉我的情况下，他和伊丽莎白商量妥当，安排克莱瓦尔在斯特拉斯堡和我会合。这件事干扰了我在进行自己的工作时所渴望的孤独。不过在我旅程的开始阶段，我的朋友绝不会对我有所妨碍，所以我感到由衷的高兴，因为这样可以免除我做许多小时的胡思乱想。此外，亨利可以把我和我的敌人隔离开来。假如我是单独一人，难道他那可憎的形象不会经常闯到我面前来，提醒我加紧工作，或者来观察我工作的进展吗？

就这样，我决定到英国去了，自然，一俟从英国返回就和伊丽莎白举行婚礼。我父亲因为年迈而极不乐意拖延。至于我自己，在我厌恶的辛苦工作中也有了一份可以期望的报偿——对于我无以复加的苦难也终于有所安慰了，那就是展望着那一天，摆脱了我悲惨的苦役，我将得到伊丽莎白，在我们的结合里忘却过去。

我开始为我的旅行做准备了，可是总有一种感觉纠缠着我，使我充满担忧和焦虑。当我撇下亲人离家外出的时候，他们丝毫不知道他们有个仇敌，对他的袭击也毫无防备，而我的离去又恰好可能激怒他。不过他答应过，我到哪里他就到哪里，他会不会跟着我到英国去呢？这个想法本身使我恐惧，但又让人宽慰，因为这意味着我的亲人们平安无事。可是一想到也可能发生相反的情况，便又使我极为痛苦。不过，在我沦为我的创造物的奴隶期间，我只好听任自己受当时的冲动去支配了，我眼下的感觉倒是使我坚信，那个魔鬼会跟着我，从而让我的家人免遭他的毒手。

在9月下旬的时候，我再度离开了祖国。这次出门是我自己的主意，因此伊丽莎白也赞成，可是她一想到我将离开她独自经受痛苦和忧伤的折磨，就不免感到忧虑不安。正是出于这种担心，他们才找了克莱瓦尔做我的旅伴——不过女性的周到细心所留意到的千百种细节，一个男人却往往视而不见。她盼望着我早早归来——错综复杂的千种思绪使她黯然无语，只是默默流着泪和我告别了。

我跌坐在那辆载我远行的马车里，几乎不知道自己在往哪里去，对周围发生些什么事情也无心加以理会。我只记得吩咐把我的化学仪器收拾好随身带走，而我一回想到这件事就感到剧烈的痛苦。我心里充满阴郁的想象，历经了许多美丽壮观的风光景物，然而我目光呆滞，一无所见。我唯一想的是我旅行的目的，以及旅行期间要进行的工作。

在消沉倦怠中度过了几天，赶了许多里程的路，我终于抵达了斯特拉斯堡，在那里待了两天等候克莱瓦尔。他来了。唉，我们之间构成了多么鲜明的对照啊！他对每一处新的景物都有活泼敏锐的反应，他看见夕照之美会充满喜悦，当他看到太阳升起，又开始新的一天时，则更加欢欣鼓舞。他指给我看色彩变幻的风景和天空的形态。“这就是生活的意义，”他高声说，“现在我正享受着生命！可是你，亲爱的弗兰肯斯坦，为什么郁郁不乐，愁容满面啊！”的确，我心中充满了阴郁的思想，既看不见黄昏星的沉落，也看不见反射在莱茵河上的金黄的朝阳。——你，我的朋友，你如果读到克莱瓦尔的日记将会更有兴致，他是以富于感情和欢悦的眼光来观赏自然景物的，这远胜于听我讲自己的回忆。我，一个倒霉的可怜虫，被一个诅咒纠缠住了，它关闭了我所有通往欢乐的道路。

我们一致同意乘船沿莱茵河顺流而下，从斯特拉斯堡到鹿特丹，从那里再坐船前往伦敦。在这段航程中，我们经过了许多绿柳飘拂的小岛，看到了好几个风光美丽的小镇。我们在曼海姆停留了一天，然后，在离开斯特拉斯堡后的第五天，抵达了美因茨。在美因茨以下的莱茵河更是风景如画。流水湍急，在山峦之间蜿蜒前进，那些山不很高，但很陡峭，而且形态极美。我们见到许多废弃的城堡矗立在峭壁悬崖的边缘上，被高耸入云、人迹罕至的黑黝黝的森林包围着。这一段莱茵河的确呈现出奇特而变化无穷的景象。在一处，你见到的是崎岖的山峦，城堡的废墟高耸在巨岩绝壁上，黝黑的莱茵河水在下面奔腾不息，而突然转过一处山岬，你又将看见整幅风景变为枝繁叶茂的葡萄园，翠绿的倾斜的河岸，蜿蜒曲折的流水，以及人烟稠密的市镇。

我们旅行的时间正值收获葡萄的季节，当我们顺流而下航行时，便听到采摘葡萄的工人们的歌声。即使是我，心情如此消沉，情绪老是被阴郁的思绪所折磨，也不禁感到愉悦。我躺在船舱底部，望着万里无云的碧蓝的天空，似乎沉浸于久已生疏了的宁静之中。如果说我的感觉是这样，那么谁又能描绘亨利的感觉呢？他觉得自己仿佛被带进了仙境，享受着很少能被人体验到的欢乐。“我见过我的祖国最美的风景，”他说，“我到过洛桑和尤利湖，在那里，皑皑雪山的山脚几乎垂直地矗立在水边，在水中投射下黑黝黝的、深不可测的倒影，要不是有苍翠欲滴的岛屿以明丽的风貌加以调剂，它们本会是一派阴郁哀伤的面貌。我见过湖上掀起了暴风雨，疾风将湖水激起漩涡，让人不禁想到大洋上龙卷风卷起的水柱，浪涛愤怒地冲击着山麓，那位牧师和他的情妇就是被山崩掩埋了的，据说在夜风呼啸的间歇还能听见他们垂死的哀号。我还见过拉·瓦莱和贝·德·旺的群山。可是这块国土，维克多，却比所有那些奇异景观更让我喜欢。瑞士的群山更为宏伟和奇特，但这绝妙的河流两岸却有着我从未领略过的无与伦比的魅力。看看那座耸立在绝壁上的古堡，还有那座小岛上的古堡，几乎被美丽的树荫所掩没。现在看看从葡萄园中走出来的那一群工人，还有那半隐在山坳里的小村庄。啊，真的，居住并守卫着这块地方的精灵，和我们国家里那些垒起冰川或者栖身于高不可攀的峰巅的精灵相比，一定具有与人类更为和谐的灵魂。”

克莱瓦尔！亲爱的朋友！即使是现在，我也愿欣然记下你的谈话，尽情给予你应得的赞美。他是在“大自然之诗”里饱受熏陶的人。他那奔放而热情的想象力又接受了他敏感心灵的净化。他的灵魂洋溢着热烈的情感，他的友谊是那样坚贞忠诚、异乎寻常，老于世故的人会告诉我们，这种友谊只有在想象中才能找到。不过人类的同情心还不足以满足他那热切的思想。对身外的大自然美景，别人只是赞叹而已，他却炽热地爱恋——

那喧哗的瀑布

像激情般萦绕心头：巨岩，

山峦，浓密而幽深的树林，

它们的色彩和形态，就像他的

欲念；是一种感情，一种爱，

它们不需要思想来提供

隔膜的魅力，也不依赖任何

并非来自眼睛的力量。(1)

可是如今他在哪里？难道这个温柔可爱的人就永远消逝了吗？这个头脑如此富于思想和奇幻宏伟的想象力，它本身就构成了一个世界，而它的存在又依赖于它的创造者的生命——难道这个头脑已经毁灭了吗？难道它现在只能存在于我的记忆之中了吗？不，不是这样，你那神授天造的、光彩照人的形体虽然腐朽了，但你的精神依然眷顾和安慰着你的不幸的朋友。

请原谅我这一阵哀伤的迸发，这些徒劳无益的言辞，只能表达我对亨利无与伦比的价值的些微敬意，不过它们对我因怀念他而充满痛苦的心有所安慰。我还是继续讲述我的故事吧。

我们的船顺流而下，经过了科隆，来到了荷兰平原。我们决定在剩下的路途中改乘驿车，因为吹着逆风，徐缓的水流提高不了船行的速度。

这段航程没有什么优美的风光来增添我们的兴致，不过几天之后我们就到了鹿特丹，再从那里渡海去英格兰。在12月下旬的一个晴朗的早晨，我第一次看见了英国那洁白的陡峭海岸。泰晤士河两岸呈现出一种全新的景象，沿岸土地平坦而肥沃，每一个市镇几乎都能让人回忆起某个历史故事。我们看到了蒂尔伯里要塞，想起了西班牙的无敌舰队，还看见了甚至在祖国就耳熟能详的格雷夫森德、伍尔威治和格林尼治这些地方。

终于，我们看见了伦敦那无数的尖塔，巍峨耸立在全城之上的圣保罗大教堂，以及英国历史上赫赫有名的伦敦塔。

第十九章　在苏格兰北部荒村里


伦敦是我们目前休息的地方，我们决定在这个奇妙的著名城市住上几个月。克莱瓦尔渴望和富于才华的当代名流学者交往，不过这对于我来说只是次要的目的。我主要关注的是怎样获得履行我的诺言所必需的知识，尽快借助于随身带上的介绍信，求见那些最著名的自然科学家。

假如我是在求学和玩乐的时代做这次旅行的话，它本该给我带来无法言表的乐趣。可是我的生命已经饱受摧残，我去拜访那些人物的目的，只是因为他们在我的研究课题方面可以给予相关的知识，而这个课题对我来说具有可怕的利害关系。与人交往对我来说是讨厌的事，在独处的时候，我还可以用天空和大地的奇观美景来填补我的心灵，亨利的话语也抚慰着我，我还可以这样欺骗自己以求暂时的宁静。可是，见到忙碌的人群那一张张令人厌烦的欢乐笑脸，却使我的心情重新陷于绝望。我看到在我和我的同类之间有一个难以逾越的障碍，这个障碍被打上了威廉和于斯丁的鲜血的封记，回想起种种与这两个名字相联系的事变，我的心灵便不禁充满了剧痛。

不过，我在克莱瓦尔的身上看见了我往昔的影子，他喜欢探求知识，渴望获得经验和教益。他所观察到的种种不同的生活方式，正是他取得教益和乐趣的无尽的源泉。他也一直在追求他长期瞩目的一个目标。他的计划是去访问印度，他可以通过他所了解的那个社会的信仰和观念，他所懂得的印度的多种语言，大大促进欧洲的殖民和贸易事业。只有在英国，他才能进一步实施他的计划。他永远是忙忙碌碌的，唯一影响他的欢乐心情的是我的悲伤而沮丧的情绪。我力图尽可能地掩饰住自己的这种情绪，这样便不至于剥夺他的欢乐，那些欢乐对于一个正在进入新的生活场景、不受任何忧虑和苦涩回忆困扰的人来说，是天然应该享受的。我常常拒绝和他在一起，借口说已经另有约会，以便独自留下。我现在又开始收集创造新生命的必备材料了，这对于我的折磨，就像水滴不断落到头上那样绵绵不绝。一旦想到这件事，我就会极度痛楚，一旦说话隐约触及这件事，我的嘴唇就会颤抖，我的心就会悸动。

在伦敦度过几个月以后，我们收到了一位苏格兰人的来信，他以前曾经来日内瓦作过我们的客人。他提到他的祖国如何美丽，并且问我们，是否这还不足以诱使我们把旅程向北推移，直到他所居住的珀斯。克莱瓦尔热切渴望接受这一邀请。而我，虽然厌恶交际，也希望再看看高山激流，以及大自然用以装扮她的精选住所的一切奇观胜景。

我们是在10月初到达英格兰的，现在已经是2月了。于是我们决定在下月底动身北上。在这次旅程中，我们不打算沿着直通爱丁堡的大路走，而要去访问温莎、牛津、马特洛克和昆布兰湖区，这样将在7月底左右抵达旅程的终点。我收拾好了我的化学仪器以及收集到的材料，决定在苏格兰北部高原的某个偏僻角落里完成我的工作。

我们在3月27日离开伦敦，在温莎停留了几天，漫步于那里的美丽的森林。对于我们这样的山地居民来说，这里是一派崭新的景象，伟岸的橡树，供狩猎的大量猎物，一群群气派庄严的麋鹿，一切对我们都显得新奇。

从那里出发，我们又前往牛津。当我们进入这个城市的时候，脑海里便充满了对150多年前发生在这里的种种事件的回忆。就是在这里，查理一世集结起他的军队。在整个国家都背弃了他的事业，站到国会和自由的旗帜下时，唯有这个城市仍然效忠于他。回忆起这个命运坎坷的国王、他的那些侍从们、和蔼可亲的福克兰、骄横的葛林、他的王后和王子，便给这个城市的每一处都平添了一种特殊的情趣，因为据说他们曾经在这些地方居住过。往昔岁月的精灵把这里作为了它的居所，我们兴致勃勃地寻觅着它的足迹。假如这些思古幽情尚不能让想象力得到满足，那么城市本身的美丽风貌也足以令我们赞叹不已。那些学院古风盎然，风景如画，条条街道几乎都宏伟壮观，城边的爱西斯河穿过碧绿的草地，逐渐扩展成一片平静宽阔的水面，倒映着古树环抱之中的一群群庄严的塔楼、尖顶和圆拱。

我尽情享受着这片美景，然而，我的兴致却被对往昔的回忆和对未来的设想所败坏。我生性喜爱平静的欢乐。在少年时代我的心灵从未品尝过不满足。即使我偶感闷倦无聊，一看到大自然的美景，或者研读人类智慧的卓越崇高的产物，总是能唤起内心的兴趣，给我的精神注入狂喜。而现在我是一株枯残的树，雷电已经击穿了我的灵魂，我当时感到自己活着也不过在展示一副行尸走肉的凄惨形象，别人见了可怜，自己也不堪忍受——而且这副形象不久也将难以维持了。

我们在牛津度过了相当长的一段时间，在城郊漫游，极力要确认每一处可能与英国历史上最激动人心的时代有关的地点。我们小小的考古旅行常常因为不断出现新的目标而延长。我们参谒了著名的汉普顿的陵墓，还有这位爱国者阵亡的战场。有那么一刻，我的灵魂从低贱的、可怜的恐惧中升华，转而对这些景物所象征与体现的自由和自我牺牲的神圣观念沉思默想。有那么一瞬间，我敢于挣脱身上的锁链，以一种自由和高尚的精神来看待周围的一切。然而铁镣已经深深地嵌入了我的血肉，于是我战栗着，绝望着，重新堕入了可怜的自我。

我们不得不怀着遗憾离开了牛津，前往下一个歇脚处马特洛克。这个村子周围的田野与瑞士的景色比较相似，不过每件事物都要矮小一等，翠绿的山冈上方看不到更高的山峰，不像祖国有遥遥耸立的、银白色的阿尔卑斯山俯瞰着松林覆盖的群峰。我们探访了那个神奇的大洞穴，以及许多自然史的小陈列室，那里的稀世珍品摆放得与塞弗克斯和萨姆尼的收藏一模一样。当亨利说出后面这个地名时，我禁不住颤抖起来，我赶快离开了使我联想到萨姆尼那可怕情景的马特洛克。

我们从德比出发，继续北上，在昆布兰和威斯摩兰度过了两个月。我现在几乎觉得自己是在瑞士的群山之中了。在山脉的北边残留着的一块块雪地，那些湖泊，山间奔腾的激流，都是我所熟悉而颇感亲切的景象。在这里我们也结识了一些朋友，他们几乎竭尽全力来哄我快乐起来。克莱瓦尔的兴致相应比我高得多，在与才智之士做伴的时候，他的思想便开阔起来，他发现自己的天性中原来具有如此巨大的智慧与能力，那是他在和低于他的人们相处时所不曾想象到的。“我满可以在这里度过一生，”他对我说，“身在这里的群山之中，我几乎不会想念瑞士和莱茵河了。”

不过，他发现旅游者的生活在快乐之中竟也包含着许多痛苦。他的感情一直过于兴奋紧张。他刚刚开始沉静下来从容欣赏某件事物，却发现自己必须放弃它，去追求另一种引起他的注意的新鲜东西，而这种新乐趣随即又被另外的新奇事物所取代了。

我们刚刚探访过昆布兰和威斯摩兰各种各样的湖泊，对当地一些居民有了感情，这时候与苏格兰朋友约定的见面日期就逼近了，我们便离开了他们继续前行。对我来说，倒并不觉得遗憾。我已经有一段时间淡忘了自己的那个诺言，所以我担心那个魔鬼的失望会导致严重的后果。他可能还留在瑞士，可能向我的亲人们施加报复。这个念头缠绕着我，每时每刻都在折磨我，使我得不到本应享有的休息和平静。我怀着极为烦躁不安的心情等待他们的来信：一旦信来迟了，我就非常痛苦，被千百种忧虑所压倒；等到信件到了，我看见信封上伊丽莎白或者父亲的签名，竟几乎不敢拆阅，害怕厄运会得到证实。有时候，我又认为那个魔鬼在跟随着我，可能会为了催促我不再拖延而谋害我的同伴。当这些念头攫住我的时候，我片刻也不愿离开亨利，而是像影子一样地跟着他，保护他免遭想象中的杀人恶魔狂怒的报复。我觉得自己就像犯了什么大罪似的，简直无法摆脱这种犯罪意识。我其实并未犯罪，可是我的确给自己招来了一种可怕的灾祸，就像犯罪一样的致命。

我带着一双倦怠的眼睛和一颗消沉的心访问了爱丁堡，那座城市本来可以让最不幸的人也感兴趣的。克莱瓦尔并不像喜欢牛津那样喜欢它，因为牛津的古色古香使他更感愉快。不过，爱丁堡新城的美丽整齐，它那些富于浪漫情调的古堡，它那世界上最令人愉悦的郊区，亚瑟王的宝座，圣伯纳井，彭特兰山，这些又使亨利兴致勃勃，赞赏不已。可是，我却急不可耐地要想抵达旅程的终点。

一个礼拜后我们离开了爱丁堡，经过库帕、圣安德鲁斯教堂、泰伊河沿岸，最后到达了我们的朋友等候我们的珀斯。不过我没有兴致和陌生的人们笑谈，或者以一个客人应有的兴趣去分享他们的感情，参加他们的游览计划。因此我告诉克莱瓦尔自己希望在苏格兰单独旅行。“你尽情游玩吧，”我说，“让我们以后在这里会集。我可能离开一两个月，我请求你不要干预我的行动，让我过一段平静和孤独的日子。在我回来的时候，我希望自己会有更轻松的心情，更和你志趣相投。”

亨利想劝阻我，不过，他看到我坚持自己的计划，便不再劝告了。他请求我经常给他写信。“在你孤独漫游的时候，”他说，“我真愿意和你做伴，而不愿和我不认识的那些苏格兰人在一起。那么快些回来，我亲爱的朋友，这样我就可以重新感到像在家里一样，而你不在身边，我是不可能有这种感受的。”

和我的朋友分手以后，我决定到苏格兰最偏远的地方去，在与世隔绝中完成自己的工作。我不怀疑那个妖魔在跟着我，而且我一结束工作，他就会出现在我的面前，来领走他的伴侣。

按照这个决定，我穿越了北部高原，确定以奥克奈最偏僻的一个地方作为自己实施工作的地点。这是个适宜于做这种事的地方，因为这里几乎就只有一块巨岩，它那高耸的岩壁不断地被波涛拍打着。土地非常贫瘠，勉强可以喂养几头可怜的母牛，出产的燕麦也仅够五个居民糊口，他们骨瘦如柴的躯体显示出其生活的凄惨。当他们要享用蔬菜、面包这样的奢侈品，甚至需要淡水的时候，则须从大约五英里之遥的大陆上运过来。

整个小岛上只有三座极为简陋的茅屋，在我到那儿的时候，其中一座是空着的。我租下了它。它只有两个房间，都显示出最凄惨的贫穷所具有的一切污秽破烂。屋顶的稻草塌陷了，墙壁上没涂泥灰，门也脱了铰链。我让人把屋子修理了一下，买了几件家具，便住了下来。要不是村民们都已经被贫穷匮乏弄得感觉麻木了的话，我住在这儿无疑会引起某种震惊的。事实上，我完全没有受到注意和打扰，我赠送了村民们一点食物和衣服，也没有人来道谢，苦难竟能把人们最粗糙的感觉能力也弄得如此迟钝。

在这个隐居地，我上午全部用来工作，但在傍晚，在天气允许的时候，我就到多石的海滩上去散步，倾听海浪咆哮和拍击在脚下的声音。这是一派单调而又永远在变化着的景色。我想起了瑞士，它和这里荒凉而骇人的景象远远不同。它那些山冈都覆盖着葡萄树，村舍密密地散布在平原上。它那些美丽的湖水映照着蔚蓝而柔和的天空，当风打破湖面的宁静时，那浪花和这里大海的咆哮相比，只不过像活泼的儿童在戏水一样。

我刚到的时候，就这样安排我的工作和消遣，可是，随着工作的步步进展，它也一天天变得越来越可憎可厌。有时候，我接连几天也没法说服自己走进工作室，而在其他时候，我又夜以继日地拼命干以期尽快完成我的工作。我干的真是一件肮脏事。在前一次实验期间，我还被某种疯狂的热情遮住了眼睛，不知道这种工作的可怕，我的思想还完全专注于事业的成功，所以看不见整个工作过程是多么令人憎恶。而现在，每当我残忍地强使自己进入工作室的时候，不禁对手头的工作感到恶心不已。

我就在这样的处境中，干着最可憎的事情，在这样的孤独中，没有什么能让我的注意力有一瞬刻从实际工作的场景中转移开去，因此，我的精神状况失去了平衡，我变得焦躁不安，神经过敏。我每时每刻都在害怕见到我的那个迫害者。有时候，我眼睛盯着地面坐着，不敢抬头观看，唯恐会看见自己惧怕见到的那个东西。我也害怕走出当地村民的视野，唯恐他会趁我独自一人的时候来向我索要他的伴侣。

与此同时，我的工作也在继续，而且取得了相当大的进展。我怀着既疑惧又急切地希望的心理期待着它的完成，我不敢让自己去深究那个希望是什么，可是它交织着种种模糊的凶兆，使我的心异常沉重。





第二十章　决裂


一天傍晚，我正坐在工作室里。夕阳西下，月亮也刚刚从海面上升起，因为缺乏做工作的足够光线，我只好无所事事地待着，心里在考虑到底是把事儿留到夜晚来做呢，还是继续集中精力弄完它。就这样坐着的时候，我脑海中涌现出一连串的思绪，引得我去考虑目前所做的事可能产生什么后果。三年以前，我也曾像这样努力工作过，并创造出了一个魔鬼，他无比野蛮地摧残了我的心，使它永远充满了苦涩的悔恨。现在，我又要创造出另一个生命了，对她的性情我同样一无所知，她也许会比她的男伴恶毒一万倍，而且以杀人作恶本身为乐事。男魔鬼曾经立誓将远离人类，躲到荒无人烟的地方去，可是她并没有立过誓，而且她很可能是个能思想、会推理的动物，或许会拒绝服从在她诞生之前订下的契约。他们可能彼此产生憎恨，现在活着的那个家伙憎恶自己的畸形相貌，那么当他眼前出现了同样丑陋的一个异性时，难道他不会产生更强烈的憎恶吗？她也可能会厌恶他，转而爱上人类更加美好的形象，她可能离开他，而他便再次陷于孤独，便会因为受到新的刺激，即因被自己的同类所抛弃而变得万分恼怒。

即使他们会离开欧洲，到新世界的荒芜之地去定居，但那个魔鬼渴求的所谓同情的第一个后果便是生养孩子，这样魔鬼的种族将在地球上繁衍下去，从而使得人类的生存状况变得岌岌可危，充满恐惧。难道我为了一时的私利，有权给子孙万代种下这一个祸根吗？我以前被自己创造出来的那个家伙的诡辩所打动，被他那恶魔般的威胁弄得一时丧失了理智，可是现在，我第一次陡然发觉自己的许诺的邪恶性质。想到未来的人类将把我当作祸害来诅咒，因为我的私心，为了自己的安宁，竟然毫不犹豫地付出了整个人类生存的代价，我不寒而栗。

我浑身颤抖，心脏仿佛停止了跳动。就在这时候，我抬起了头，在月光中，竟看见那个魔鬼正在窗前。他凝视着我，见我正坐在那儿完成着他分派给我的任务，便裂着嘴唇露出了怪异的狞笑。对了，他一路上都在跟着我，他不是在森林里游荡，就是在洞穴里藏身，再不然就栖身于荒野的石楠丛中。现在他来查看我的进度，要求我履行我的诺言了。

在我望着他的时候，他的脸上露出了极其恶毒和狡诈的表情。我怀着发疯似的感觉想到，自己竟然会允诺给他再造一个和他一样的怪物，不禁愤怒得发抖，立即把我制作的东西撕得粉碎。怪物见我毁掉了他的幸福所依赖的未来的生命，便发出了一声恶魔般的绝望和仇恨的嚎叫，离我而去。

我走出房间，锁上了门，在心中庄严宣誓绝不继续干这项工作了，然后，我步履蹒跚地走回我的卧室。我孤零零的，身边没有一个人来排解心中的阴郁，将我从最恐怖的梦魇那令人作呕的压抑中解救出来。

几个小时过去了，我仍然在窗前凝视着大海，风已经平息了，大海几乎凝止不动，整个大自然都在宁静月亮的眼光下休憩了。只有几艘渔船点缀在海面上，微风不时飘送来渔夫们此呼彼应的话语声。我感受着这一片静谧，虽然我几乎察觉不到这种静谧无边的深沉，直到岸边的划桨声传入我耳中，有个人在我屋子的近旁上了岸。

过了几分钟，我听见屋门格格作响，似乎有人在尽量轻轻地打开它。我从头到脚都颤抖起来，我预感到是谁来了，想去叫醒离我的茅屋不远处一座村舍里的农民，可是我被无法动弹的感觉控制了，就像在噩梦中常常发生的那样，你费尽力气要想逃脱眼前的危险，可你就像在原地生了根似的。

接着我就听见了沿着过道传来的脚步声，门被打开了，我所恐惧的怪物出现了。他关上了门，走近我，用压抑住的声音说道：“你毁掉了已经开始的工作，你到底想做什么？你胆敢破坏你的许诺吗？我历经劳累和折磨；我跟你一道离开了瑞士；我沿着莱茵河的两岸潜行，走过长满柳树的小岛，翻越沿岸的山岭。我在英格兰的丛林中和苏格兰的荒野里度过了好几个月。我忍受了无法估计的疲惫、寒冷和饥饿，难道你胆敢毁灭我的希望吗？”

“滚开！我的确撕毁了我的诺言，我绝不会再创造一个像你那样的东西，跟你一样的丑陋，一样的邪恶。”

“贱奴，我以前还跟你讲道理，可是，你已经证明了自己不配我给你面子。你记住，我是有力量的，你认为自己很不幸，可是我要把你弄得更凄惨，直到你对阳光也感到憎恶为止。你是我的创造者，但我是你的主人，——听我吩咐！”

“我犹豫不决的时刻已经过去了，你施展威力的时候到来了。你的威胁不可能使我去做邪恶的事，它们只能坚定我绝不给你造一个罪恶伙伴的决心。难道我会残酷地给世界释放出一个以死亡和作恶为乐的魔鬼吗？滚开！我是坚定不移的，你的话只能更激起我的怒火。”

妖魔从我的脸上看出了我的决心，怀着无可奈何的愤怒一阵咬牙切齿。“难道每个男人都可以怀抱一个妻子，”他叫喊道，“每头野兽也都有它的配偶，而我就该孤孤单单？我也有爱悦之情，可是只能得到厌弃和轻蔑作为回报。人啊！你可以恨我，可是你得留神！你将在恐惧和悲伤中度过你的岁月，雷霆不久就会降临在你头上，并将永远夺走你的欢乐。难道我在悲惨境况中饱受凌辱之时，你竟会快乐吗？你可以摧残我的其他感情，但复仇之心绝不会消亡——复仇，从今以后将比阳光和食物更宝贵！我也许会死，但我先要让你，我的暴君和折磨者，诅咒那看着你受罪的太阳。当心，我毫无畏惧，因而无比强大。我将以毒蛇般的狡诈盯紧你，这样就可以用毒液来螫你。人啊，你将因伤害了我而懊悔的。”

“魔鬼，住嘴！别用你那些邪恶的声音来毒化空气。我已经向你宣布了我的决定，我绝不是在你的话语面前屈服的胆小鬼。去你的吧，我是不会改变的。”

“那好，我走。不过你记住，在你的新婚之夜我会来找你的。”

我向前扑去，高叫道：“恶棍！在你签发我的死亡证以前，当心你自己的狗命。”

本来我可以抓住他的，可是他躲开了我，猛然冲出了茅屋。很快就见他坐在小船里，像箭一般迅速掠过水面，不一会儿就消失在波涛间。

一切又恢复了平静，可是，他的话还在我的耳中回响着。我怒火万丈，恨不得去追赶那个破坏了我的平静的坏蛋，把他扔进大海里。我在房间里心情烦乱地急匆匆来回走动，同时，我的想象力又在脑海中描绘着千百种折磨和刺激我的情景。我为什么没有追上他，与他做一场生死搏斗啊？我竟然允许他离开，而且他是一直朝大陆方向逃去的。我一想到谁将是他那无法满足的复仇欲望的下一个牺牲者，就不寒而栗。接着我又想起了他的话——“在你的新婚之夜我会来找你的。”这么说来，那将是我命运结束的日子了。在那个时刻我将死去，同时也就满足并消除了他的怨恨。这种前景倒并不使我恐惧，然而，当我想到我亲爱的伊丽莎白——在发现自己的爱人被残酷地夺走时，她那痛苦的眼泪和无尽的哀伤——我的眼泪，许多个月以来的第一次，不禁夺眶而出。我决心在没有和我的仇敌苦斗一番之前，自己绝不能倒下。

黑夜过去了，太阳从海面上升起。我的心情变得比较平静了，如果狂暴的愤怒蜕化为深沉的绝望也可以称之为平静的话。我离开了茅屋，离开了昨夜发生激烈冲突的这可怕的地方，沿着海滩走去。我几乎已把大海视为隔绝我和我的同类的一座不可逾越的屏障了。不，这是我心里滋长起的一个愿望，唯愿其成为事实。我渴望自己能在这贫瘠的岩岛上度过余生，生活的确会是乏味的，但是不会受到任何突发不幸事件的袭击。如果我返回大陆，就会牺牲生命，或者亲眼看见我最爱的人死在我亲手创造的魔鬼手下。

我就像个烦躁不宁的鬼魂，在小岛上徘徊，和所爱的人分离，在这分离中备受痛苦。到中午时分，太阳高悬在天空，我在草地上躺下，不禁沉沉睡去。前一天夜里我通宵未曾入眠，精神焦虑，眼睛由于紧张守候和极度悲痛而发炎了。这一觉使我恢复了精神，当我醒来的时候，又感到自己仿佛回归到人类之中来了。于是我开始更冷静地考虑此前发生的事情，不过魔鬼的话语仍然像丧钟一样在我耳畔鸣响，它们仿佛是一场噩梦，可是又像现实那样清晰和难以忍受。

太阳已经西沉，我仍然坐在海岸上，用一块燕麦饼来填充辘辘饥肠，这时候，我看见有一条渔船在附近靠了岸，船上的一个人给我带来了一个邮包，邮包里有日内瓦的来信，还有克莱瓦尔给我的一封信，是请求我去和他会合的。他说，现在他在那里毫无收获地浪费着时间，而他在伦敦结识的朋友们来信要他到伦敦去，对他去印度的事做最后的商议。他不能再推迟离开当地的日子了。他到伦敦之后也许接着就要开始下一个漫长的旅程，出发的时间甚至会比现在预料的还早，所以他要我尽可能和他多聚些日子。因此，他恳求我离开孤岛到珀斯去和他碰头，然后一道南下。这封信在一定程度上把我唤回到现实生活中来了，我决定在两天后离开小岛。

可是，在离开之前我还有件事情要完成，一想起它我就不禁浑身颤抖。我必须收拾好我的化学仪器，为此我必须再走进那间我做过丑恶工作的房间，我必须处理那些我一看见就会作呕的器具。第二天早晨天一亮，我就鼓起勇气打开了工作室的门。我所毁掉的那个半完工的生命体狼藉不堪地散布在地上，我几乎觉得自己曾经胡乱肢解过一个人的鲜活的躯体。我站立了一会儿，借以镇定自己，然后走进了房间。我用颤抖的手把仪器搬到了房间外面，不过我又想起不能遗留下那东西的任何残骸，以免引起当地农民们的惊惧和怀疑。于是我又把残留物装进一个筐子里，再放进许多石块，决定暂时放在一边，等到当天夜间扔到海里去。在这段时间里，我坐在海滩上，清洗和整理我的那些化学仪器。

自从魔鬼出现的那个夜晚，我的感情发生了深刻的变化，世上再没有什么比这种变化更彻底的了。过去我总是怀着阴郁的绝望情绪来看待自己的诺言，认为不论结果如何，那都是我必须完成的一件事。而现在，我感到仿佛是蒙在眼睛上的一层荫翳被揭去了，我第一次把一切看得清清楚楚。我哪怕片刻也不会想到去重新开始那项工作了。我听到的那番威胁我的话，还沉重地压在我的心上，但我并未去想应该采取什么主动的行动去逃避。我在心里暗下决心，再造一个像我第一次制造的那样的魔鬼，将是最卑鄙、最残酷的自私行为，我从心里消除了可能导致不同结论的任何想法。

凌晨两三点钟，月亮升起来了，我把那个筐子放到一条小帆船里，驾船驶到离岸大约四英里的海上。万籁无声，有几条小船正从海上驶回岸边，我避开了它们。我觉得自己是去实施一桩可怕的罪行，战战兢兢地躲着不敢碰上别人。明净的月亮有一刻突然被一团乌云遮住了，我利用这黑暗的瞬刻，把筐子扔进了大海，我听着筐子沉下去的时候发出了汩汩的响声，随后便驾船离开了那里。天空渐渐乌云密布，不过空气很清新，尽管不断刮起的东北风带来了一阵寒意。它使我精神振奋，使我充满了惬意的感觉，所以我决定在海面上多待一阵，于是我把舵固定在直航的位置，伸展四肢躺在船底。乌云遮蔽了月亮，一切都朦朦胧胧，我只听见船身划破波涛的声响。那含混低沉的声音为我催眠，不一会儿我就沉沉入睡了。

我不知道自己在这种情况下待了多久，不过当我醒来的时候，我发现太阳已经升得相当高了。风力强劲，海浪不断地威胁着我的小船的安全。我发现刮的是东北风，它一定已经把我远远地吹离了我出发处的海岸。我极力改变航向，可是即刻就发现，如果我再试图这样做的话，小船立刻就会灌满海水。在这样的情况下，我唯一的办法是顺着风向航行。我得承认自己有点感到恐惧了。我没有带罗盘，而且对这一地区的地理情况知道得很少，所以太阳也不能给我帮多大的忙。我可能会被风刮进辽阔的大西洋，受尽饥饿的折磨，或者被周围咆哮冲击着的无边巨浪吞没。我在海上已经过了许多钟头了，此刻已感到口渴难耐，而这只不过是我其他种种苦难的开始。我抬头望天空，天上密布乌云，风刚吹开一团乌云，又吹来另一团代替它。我望着大海，它将是我的葬身之地。“魔鬼，”我高叫道，“你的任务算是完成了！”我想到了伊丽莎白，想到了父亲，想到了克莱瓦尔，他们还留在人世，魔鬼还可能用他们来满足残酷无情的嗜血欲望。这个念头把我抛进了如此绝望而恐怖的噩梦，即使是现在，在那个情景即将永远在我眼前消失的时候，我一想到它也不禁浑身发抖。

就这样过了几个钟头，在太阳向地平线坠落的时候，大风渐渐减弱为微风，海面上也不见了波浪。可是代之而起的是巨大的海潮，我感到头晕目眩，几乎不能掌稳舵，这时候我突然看见南边有一条高耸的陆地线。

我由于疲劳和几个钟头可怕的提心吊胆，几乎精疲力竭，这种突然得以确保生命的感觉真像一股暖流涌上了我的心头，我的眼泪也不禁夺眶而出。

我们的情感是多么的变幻莫测，而且，即使在极其悲惨的处境中，我们对生命执着的爱又是多么奇特！我用自己衣服的一块布做成另一片帆，急切地驾着船向那陆地驶去。它看上去像是一片荒野巨石，可是当我更接近一些的时候，我很容易就看出了耕种的迹象。我看到了岸边停泊着一些船，立即感到自己又被送回了文明人的社会。我小心地沿着弯弯曲曲的海岸行驶，终于看见一个教堂尖塔从一个矮小的海岬后面显露出来，我不禁欢呼起来。因为自己当时处于极度虚弱的状态，所以我决定直接向那座城镇驶去，那样可以很方便地获得食物。幸运的是我当时身边带有钱。船转过海峡，我看见了一个整洁的市镇和一个挺好的港口，我随即把船驶进去，因为意想不到的死里逃生而高兴得心里怦怦直跳。

就在我忙着停船和收拾风帆的时候，有几个人朝这边走来。他们似乎因为我的出现而感到惊异，可是他们并没有给我任何帮助，而是打着手势悄悄地议论着，换了别的场合，这种情况可能会多少引起我的警觉。事实上，我只是注意到了他们讲的是英语，因此我也用英语问他们。“好心的朋友，”我说，“你们可以告诉我这个市镇的名字，告诉我到了哪里吗？”

“你很快就会明白的，”一个人用嘶哑的声音答道，“也许你到了一个不怎么合你口味的地方。不过我可以保证，你该到哪里去，倒是由不得你了。”

听到一个陌生人如此粗鲁的回答，我不禁感到极为惊讶，同时我也觉察到他的同伴们那不满和愤怒的神情，更是感到不安。“你们的回答为什么这样不客气？”我答道，“如此不友好地接待朋友绝不是英国人的习惯。”

“我不懂英国人的习惯是什么，”那个人说，“不过爱尔兰人的习惯是憎恨坏蛋。”

就在这场奇怪的对话进行着的时候，我觉察到围观的人在迅速地增多。他们的脸上带着好奇与愤怒相交织的表情，这使我恼怒，也使我有些惊恐。我向他们打听去旅店的路，但没有一个人回答我。于是我就往前走，人群跟着我，围着我，并发出咕哝声。这时候有一个相貌恶狠狠的人走近我，拍着我的肩膀说：“来，先生，你得跟我去见克汶先生，谈谈你的情况。”

“谁是克汶先生？我为什么要谈我的情况？这里难道不是一个自由的国家？”

“当然，先生，对于诚实的人来说是够自由的。克汶先生是位行政官，而你要谈谈有关一位绅士死亡的情况，他昨晚在这里被谋杀了。”

这一回答使我大吃一惊，不过我立即就控制住了自己。我是清白的，这很容易得到证明。于是我便默默地跟随着我的指挥者，被带到了镇上最漂亮的一所房子里。我随时都可能因疲惫和饥饿而跌倒在地，可是自己被这一大群人围着，我想作为上策还是打起精神为好，以免别人把我体力的衰弱误认作恐惧或者自觉有罪。我那时一点也没料到几分钟后灾祸就会从天而降，一切对耻辱和死亡的忧虑都将在恐怖和绝望中消失殆尽。

讲到这儿我必须稍事休息了，因为我要根据记忆详细地讲述随后发生的事情，而回忆那些可怕的事需要我聚集起全部坚忍的意志。





第二十一章　克莱瓦尔之死


我很快就被带到了行政官的面前，那是一个慈祥的老人，态度平静而温和。可是他带着几分严厉的神情看着我，然后转身向着带我来的人，问谁将在这件事中做见证。

有五六个人走上前来；其中一个被行政官选定，他宣誓做证说，在发生谋杀的前一天夜里，他和儿子、妹夫丹尼尔·纽根特一起出海捕鱼，大约十点钟，他们发现刮起了一股强劲的北风，于是将船驶进了港湾。那是一个漆黑的夜晚，因为月亮还没有升起，他们没在港口上岸，而是按照习惯在港口下方两英里的一个小海湾那儿靠的岸。他拿着一部分捕鱼用具在前面走，他的同伴在后面不远的地方跟着他。就在他沿着沙滩往前走着的时候，脚下突然绊着了什么东西，跌倒在地上。同伴走上前来准备扶起他，借着提灯的光亮，他们发现他正扑倒在一个人的身上，那个人看来显然已经死了。他们起初猜测那是一个被淹死的人的尸体，是被海浪冲到岸上来的，可是，经过查看，他们发现死者的衣服并不是湿的，而且当时身体还没有变凉。他们立即把那个人抬到附近一个老妇人的茅屋里，并且尽力抢救，可是没能救活。死者是个相貌英俊的男子，大约二十五岁年纪。他显然是被掐死的，因为除了颈部有手指留下的乌黑印记以外，没有任何暴力的痕迹。

证词的前半部分没有引起我的半点兴趣，可是，当提到颈部的手指印的时候，我想起了弟弟被谋害的事，感到非常激动，我四肢发抖，眼前一片模糊，不得不靠在一把椅子上支撑自己。行政官敏锐的眼光注意到了我，从我的表现中无疑只能看出于我极为不利的征兆。

儿子证实了父亲的叙述，而丹尼尔·纽根特被叫上前来的时候，他发誓说在他的同伴摔倒以前，他看见在离海岸不远的地方有一条船，船上有一个人，他当时在微弱的星光下可以看清，那正是刚才靠岸的我的那一条船。

一个女人宣誓做证说，她住在那片海滩的附近，在听说发现了尸体前大约一小时，她站在自己的茅屋门前等候打鱼的人回来，这时候她见到了一条小船，船上有个男子，正在离开后来发现尸体的那段海岸。

另一个女人证实了把尸体抬到她屋子里来的那些渔夫们的叙述，尸体确实还没有变凉。大家把它放到床上，进行按摩，丹尼尔还到镇上去请药剂师，可是已经没法救活了。

关于我登岸的情况，还传讯了其他几个人，他们众口一词地说，因为那天夜里刮着强劲的北风，很可能我的船几个小时里被风吹来吹去，最后不得不回到我原来离岸的地点。此外，他们还说，看来我是从别的地方把尸体弄到这儿来的，这是很有可能的，因为我似乎并不十分熟悉这里海岸的情况，所以我会在这个港口停靠，一点也不知道镇子和我抛下尸体的地点之间相距有多远。

克汶先生听了这些证词，打算把我带到准备殡葬的尸体所停放的那个房间去，以便观察我看见尸体的时候会有怎样的反应。很可能是因为我在证人叙述谋杀案的情况时表现得过于激动，他才产生了这个念头。于是，我被行政官和其他几个人带到了旅店。在这个是非之夜竟然出现了这么多奇怪的巧合，我不能不感到极度的惊讶，不过我心里明白，在尸体被人发现的那个时候，我正在和自己居住的那个小岛上的几个人谈话，因此我对这件事的结果怎样是毫不担忧的。

我走进了停放尸体的房间，被带到了棺材前。我怎么能够描述自己见到那具遗体时的感觉呢？直到现在我还极为恐惧，我一想起那个可怕的时刻就不能不战栗和哀痛。当我看到亨利·克莱瓦尔那毫无生气的躯体直挺挺地躺在我眼前的时候，什么法律审查啊，行政官和见证人啊，都像梦幻一样在我脑海中消失了。我几乎喘不过气来，全身扑上了遗体，高声呼叫道：“亲爱的亨利，我那置人于死地的邪恶念头也夺去了你的生命吗？我已经毁灭了两个人了，更多的牺牲者还等待着他们的命运，可是你，克莱瓦尔，我的朋友，我的恩人——”

人的躯体再也无力承受我所受的剧烈痛苦，我猛烈地痉挛着被人抬出了房间。

接着我就患了一场热病。我躺了两个月，濒临死亡的边缘。后来别人告诉我，我的病中的疯狂呓语是令人骇然的，我称自己是杀害威廉、于斯丁和克莱瓦尔的凶手。有时候，我哀求我的看护帮助我去杀死那个折磨我的魔鬼；有时候，我觉得妖魔的手指已经掐住了我的脖子，于是痛苦而恐惧地尖叫起来。幸而在我用母语说话的时候，只有克汶先生能听懂，可是我的手势和痛苦的哭叫声却吓坏了其他的见证人。

我为什么不死啊？从来也没有人像我这样不幸，可是我为什么不归于遗忘和安息呢？死亡曾夺走了多少如鲜花盛开的儿童的生命，夺走了钟爱他们的父母们的唯一希望，有多少新娘和年轻的恋人们前一天还健康而充满希望，第二天便成了蛆虫的食粮和墓中的腐尸！而我是什么材料制成的，竟能抵抗住这么多突然打击，它们就像车轮转动一样周而复始地不断折磨我？

然而我命中注定要活下去。两个月以后，我发现自己仿佛从梦中苏醒，正躺在牢房里一张破烂的床上，周围是牢卒、看守，铁栓，以及监狱里应有尽有的恶劣器物。我记得，我恢复知觉的时候正是早晨，我已经记不得过去发生的事情的细节了，只是感到有一场大祸降临到了自己的头上。不过当我环顾四周，看到了装着铁条的窗户以及自己所在的污秽的房间时，所有的事都一下子闪过脑际，于是我痛苦地呻吟起来。

我的呻吟惊醒了坐在我旁边一把椅子上打瞌睡的老妇人。她是一个狱卒的老婆，被雇来看护我的。她的相貌表现出了那个阶层特有的各种低下的特征，她的面部线条生硬粗俗，正像那种惯于无动于衷地观看悲惨景象的人。她说话的语气也表明了她的漠不关心，她对我说英语，那声音让我觉得仿佛在发病的时候曾经听见过——

“现在好些了吗，先生？”她问道。

我也用英语回答她，声音非常微弱：“我想是好些了，不过要真是这样，而并不是我在做梦的话，那我非常遗憾自己还活着承受这种痛苦和恐惧。”

“说到这一点，”老妇人答道，“要是你指的是那位被你杀害的先生，我倒相信你不如死了的好，因为我想你活着会很难受的。不过这事儿和我没有关系，我是被派来看护你的，而且让你好起来了，我尽职尽责，问心无愧，要是人人都这样就好了。”

这个老妇人竟然对一个刚从死亡边缘上被救回来的人说这样无情的话，使我很反感，可是我觉得衰弱无力，无法思考发生过的一切事情。我生活中的一连串事变仿佛是一场噩梦，有时候我甚至怀疑它们到底是不是真的，因为它们对我的思想来说根本不具有真实作用。

随着在我眼前浮现的那些景象变得更为清晰，我的热病又发作起来。一片黑暗沉重地压着我，身边没有人用温柔的声音来给我抚慰，没有亲切的手来给我支持。医生来给我开了处方，老妇人给我准备了药，但前者显然漫不经心，后者的脸上则流露出强烈的残忍表情。除了可以得到一份佣金的刽子手而外，谁会对一个杀人犯的死活感兴趣呢？

这些是我开始时的想法；不过我很快就体会到克汶先生对我表现出了极大的仁慈。是他吩咐把监狱里最好的监房收拾出来给我住（尽管最好的监房也是很差的），也是他给我派来了医生和看护。的确，他本人很少来看我，因为他尽管热切地希望为每一个人减轻痛苦，但他并不愿意亲眼看着一个杀人犯受折磨，亲耳听见他那悲惨的呓语。因此，他只是有时候来看看我是否没被照管好，但他每次只待一会儿，间隔的时间也很长。

在我逐渐恢复的某一天，我坐在一把椅子上，半闭着眼睛，脸色青灰，就像死人一样。我完全被忧郁和悲伤压倒了，常常想到自己真不如死了好，何必活在这个充满了苦难的世上。我还曾经考虑过，自己并非像于斯丁那样完全清白无辜，是否干脆承认有罪，接受法律的惩处算了。就在我这样思忖着的时候，牢房的门被打开了，克汶先生走了进来，他的脸上流露出同情和怜悯的表情。他把一把椅子拉近我坐下，用法语对我说：“我想这地方对你来说很糟糕，我还能做些什么让你更舒适一点呢？”

“我感谢你，不过你提到的一切对我来说都是没用的，在这个世界上再没有什么舒适是我可以享受的了。”

“我明白，对于像你这样遭受了如此奇异的厄运的人来说，陌生人的同情是没有多大作用的。但是我希望你会很快脱离这个阴郁的住所，因为毫无疑问，我们很容易获得证据来解除对你的犯罪指控。”

“对此我并不在乎，由于一连串奇异的事变，我已经成为人间最不幸的人了。我现在受着、并且一直在这样受着迫害和折磨，死亡对于我来说难道还算什么灾难吗？”

“的确，最近发生的那些奇怪的巧合，真是最不幸、最痛苦的事了。由于某种惊人的偶然事件，你一到这个素以好客著称的海滨市镇，就被逮捕，并被指控犯了谋杀罪。你第一眼看到的是你朋友的尸体，他好像是被魔鬼以不可思议的方式杀害了，又被放置在你将经过的道路上。”

克汶先生说这番话的时候，尽管我因为回忆起自己的遭遇而感到激动，但又对他似乎非常了解我的情况感到相当惊奇。我猜想自己脸上一定流露出了惊讶的神情，因为克汶先生急忙说：“就在你病倒以后，你个人的所有文字材料都转给了我，我仔细地查阅了，希望能从中找出一些线索，以便把你的不幸遭遇和生病的情况通知你的亲人。我找到了几封信，其中一封从一开头就可以看出是你父亲写来的。我即刻向日内瓦发出了信函，从发信之日算起差不多过去两个月了。——不过你仍然病着，甚至现在你还在颤抖，你不宜再受任何性质的刺激了。”

“这样提心吊胆比听到最可怕的消息更让人难受。请告诉我，又发生了什么新的谋杀事件，现在我又要为谁的死亡而哀伤了？”

“你的家人平安无恙，”克汶先生温和地说，“有一个人，一个亲人，要来探望你。”

我不明白是怎么会有那个念头的，不过它一下子跳进了我的脑海：那个凶手要嘲弄我的不幸，利用克莱瓦尔的死来作弄我，制造新的刺激来迫使我就范。我用手捂住眼睛，痛苦地叫道：“啊！把他带走！我不能见他，看在上帝的分上，别让他进来！”

克汶先生带着困惑不安的表情看着我。他难免会从我的喊叫中推断出我是有罪的，因此他用相当严厉的口气说道：“年轻人，我本来以为你父亲的到来会受到欢迎，而不会激起如此强烈的反感的。”

“我的父亲！”我叫起来，我的痛苦化为了欢乐，我的面部表情和全身肌肉都即刻消除了紧张，“我父亲真的来了？多好啊，太好了！可是他在哪里，他为什么还不赶快来看我？”

我态度的变化使得行政官感到既惊讶又高兴，他也许认为我前面的喊叫是精神狂乱的暂时复发而已。他站起来，和看护一起走出了牢房，父亲接着就进来了。

在这个时刻，父亲的到来所给予我的欢乐，再没有别的什么能够比拟了。我向他伸出手，叫喊道：“你平安吗——还有伊丽莎白——还有欧内斯特都平安吗？”

父亲让我放心，说他们都平安无恙，并详细讲述了我最关心的种种话题，借以振作我沮丧的情绪，不过他很快就感到牢房并不是一个令人快活的居所。“你住的是怎样一个地方啊，我的儿子！”他说，一面悲伤地看着带铁条的窗户和室内的一派凄惨状况。“你的旅行目的在于寻求快乐，然而厄运似乎紧跟着你。还有可怜的克莱瓦尔——”

听到我那不幸的、被谋害的朋友的名字，真是一个太大的刺激，我衰弱的身体简直无法承受，我的眼泪夺眶而出。

“啊！是的，父亲，”我回答道，“某种最可怕的厄运笼罩在我的头上，而我不得不活着听它摆布，要不然我早该死在亨利的灵柩之上了。”

我们不可能继续谈下去，因为我那极不稳定的健康状况要求特别谨慎，必须确保情绪平静。克汶先生进来了，坚持说我不能因为过度劳累而导致体力衰竭。不过父亲的到来对我而言就像善良天使的降临，我的健康渐渐有了起色。

当我的病痊愈了，我又深深沉浸在阴暗忧郁的情绪中，任何事情也无法加以排遣。克莱瓦尔的形象，他那可怕的、被谋杀的模样，始终浮现在我的眼前。这种回忆使我极度的焦躁不安，我的朋友们不止一次地担忧我有旧病复发的危险。唉！他们为什么要保护一条可怜又可憎的生命呢？我的命运肯定已经走到了尽头，它正在逼近终点。快了，啊！很快了，死亡将遏制心脏的跳动，把我从那压垮我的痛苦的重负下解救出来，而且，在执行法律给我的判决的时候，我也同样会归于安息的。可是，尽管对死的渴望不断出现在脑海里，死亡的到来却仍是遥远渺茫的。我常常接连几个钟头一动不动、一言不发地坐着，盼望发生什么翻天覆地的巨变，把我和我的那个毁灭者一道埋葬在废墟里。

巡回法庭的开庭期快到了。我已经在监狱里被拘禁了三个月。尽管我的身体还很虚弱，并且一直处于病症复发的危险期，但我仍然要赶近百英里的路程到法庭所在的郡首府去。克汶先生竭尽全力为我收集证据和安排辩护事宜。我终于免于在大庭广众面前屈辱地作为罪犯出庭，因为本案并没有被呈交给操生死大权的法庭。鉴于有证据表明，我的朋友的尸体被发现的时刻我正在奥克奈群岛，大陪审团驳回了起诉状。就在我被移送到郡首府的两个礼拜后，我被释放出了监狱。

父亲看到我洗刷了强加于身的罪名，又可以呼吸新鲜的空气，并能回到自己的祖国，真是欣喜若狂。我却没法分享这样的感情，因为对于我来说，地牢的土墙和宫殿的墙壁都是同样的可憎。生命之杯已永远注满了毒汁，虽然太阳照耀着我，就像照耀那些心中充满幸福和欢乐的人们一样，可是我却只看见身边是一片浓密而可怕的黑暗，没有任何光线可以穿透它，只有两只目光闪烁的眼睛在黑暗中盯着我，有时候，那是在垂死痛苦中的亨利的如泣如诉的眼睛，乌黑的眼珠几乎被眼睑和周围的长长的黑睫毛遮掩了；有时候，那又是妖魔的湿漉漉的、像蒙着一层荫翳的眼睛，就像我在英戈尔施塔特的房间里第一次见到他时一样。

父亲极力要在我的心中唤起爱。他谈起我很快就要返回的日内瓦——谈起伊丽莎白和欧内斯特，可是他的这些话只能引发我更为沉痛的呻吟。有时候，我的确怀着对幸福的渴望，我也怀着略带几分忧郁的欢乐想念着我的表妹，我还怀着销蚀人心的思乡情，渴望再见到那些蔚蓝的湖泊和急湍的隆河，从少年时代起我就感到它们是那样的亲切。可是，我的心态总的说来却是麻木的，在这种麻木中，置身于一座监狱或是大自然最美妙的风景似乎毫无二致，而且这种麻木状态一直持续着，除非是阵发性的痛苦和绝望偶尔来打破它。在那样的时刻，我常常恨不得能结束我所厌弃的生命，这使得人们不得不一直留心和戒备着，防止我采取什么可怕的自残行为。

不过，我还留有一个未尽的责任，正是因为想着它我才最终战胜了自私的绝望情绪。那就是我必须毫不拖延地回日内瓦，去守护我深深热爱着的那些人的生命。我必须悄悄地等候着那个杀人凶手，要是我有机会找到他隐藏的地方，或者他胆敢再钻出来攻击我，我就可以准确无误地结果那个魔鬼的性命——在这个魔鬼怪异的形体里，我居然还赋予了冒充人类心灵的一个更为怪异的灵魂。父亲倒是希望再延迟一些日子动身，担心我受不了旅途的劳顿，因为我病得形销骨立——仿佛只是个徒具人形的影子了。我的精力消磨殆尽。我只剩下一副骨头架子，热病还昼夜不停地吞食着我羸弱的躯体。

然而我是如此急不可耐地催着要离开爱尔兰，父亲觉得最好还是答应我。我们搭上一艘驶往哈弗—德—格拉斯的船，趁着顺风从爱尔兰海岸出发了。时值午夜。我躺在甲板上，仰望着星星，倾听着海浪的拍击声。我欢呼那片黑暗将爱尔兰从我眼前遮没了，当我想到很快就要看见日内瓦的时候，强烈的欢乐使我的脉搏急剧跳动。过去的一切对我来说仿佛是一场噩梦，然而，我乘的这艘船，这一阵阵将我吹离可憎的爱尔兰的海风，这片包围着我的大海，它们都有力地证实了我并非被梦幻所欺骗，而且克莱瓦尔，我的朋友和最亲密的伙伴，也已经成了我的以及我所创造的魔鬼的牺牲品。我在记忆中回顾自己的一生：我在日内瓦和家人共度的宁静而快乐的岁月，母亲的去世，以及我离家去英戈尔施塔特。我浑身战栗地回想起，那种疯狂的热情如何促使我创造出了自己的可怕仇敌，我还记起了他第一次活起来的那个夜晚。我再也不能继续追溯我的思维线索了，万千思绪重压在我心头，我苦涩地哭了。

从我的热病痊愈以来，我就养成了一个习惯，每天夜里都要服用少量的鸦片酊，因为只有借助于这种麻醉药，我才能获得对维持生命至关重要的睡眠。这时，对种种不幸遭遇的回忆使我心情苦闷，于是我吞下了双倍于平时服用的剂量，很快就沉沉睡去了。可是，睡眠也没能使我摆脱思虑和痛苦而暂获安宁，梦中出现了千奇百怪的东西来惊吓我。快天亮的时候，我被某种梦魇攫住了，我觉得魔鬼掐住了我的脖子，我无法摆脱，我自己也听见呻吟声和叫喊声在耳边回响。父亲一直守护着我，发现我翻滚不宁，就叫醒了我。海浪拍击的声音仍在周围响着，头上是多云的天空，魔鬼并不在这里。我有了一种安全感，我感到，在眼前的时刻和那不可抗拒的、灾难性的未来之间暂时建立起了一种休战状态，它使我进入了某种平静的遗忘心态，这是人类精神借助于其构造特别容易获得的。





第二十二章　归家


海上的航程结束了。我们上了岸，接着向巴黎前进。我不久便发觉体力已经超出了负荷限度，必须休息以后才能继续我们的行程。父亲不知疲倦地关心和照顾我，可是他并不了解我痛苦的根源，找了一些谬误的方法来治疗我那无法医治的疾病。他希望我在社交场合去寻找消遣。我却厌恶看见人的面孔。啊，我并不厌恶他们！他们是我的兄弟，我的同类，我甚至会被他们当中最讨厌的人所吸引，正像我会被那些具有超凡天性和神奇才能的人所吸引一样。可是我觉得自己没有权利与他们交往。我解开了一个人类之敌的锁链，把他释放到了人间，他的快乐便是要洒尽他们的鲜血，在他们的呻吟声中取乐。假如他们知道了我的邪恶行为，明白了我就是那些罪孽的根源时，将怎样同仇敌忾地憎恨我，并把我驱逐出这个世界啊！

父亲终于对我避免参加社交的愿望让了步，又试图申说种种理由来消除我的绝望情绪。有时候，他以为我是因为被迫面对谋杀罪的指控而深感耻辱，所以极力要向我证明过分自尊是没有益处的。

“唉！父亲，”我说，“你太不了解我了。要是像我这样的可怜虫也有自尊的话，人类，人类的感情和热望，那确实是堕落了。于斯丁，可怜的不幸的于斯丁，和我是一样的清白无辜，她也受到了同样的指控，她因此而丧命了。而我就是罪魁祸首——是我杀了她。威廉，于斯丁，还有亨利——他们都是死在我手下的。”

父亲在我被监禁的时候常常听见我说这样的话，每当我这样谴责自己时，他有时似乎想得到解释，有时则似乎只把它看作谵妄病的后遗症，认为在我病中曾有这类念头出现在想象里，而在康复期还对它保留着记忆。我避免做解释，而且对我创造出来的那个可憎的东西坚持只字不提。我拿定主意，宁愿让别人以为我疯了，这种办法可以使我缄默不言。此外，我也不能让自己披露那个秘密，谁听到它也会感到惊愕，而且满怀超乎寻常的恐惧。因此，我克制着自己对别人同情的渴求，在可能会向他人暴露那个致命秘密的时候，我就保持沉默。然而像上面所讲的那些话，我有时也会控制不住脱口而出。我不能进行任何解释，不过讲几句这样的真话也可以部分地减轻我心头莫名痛苦的重负。

这一次父亲带着极为惊异的表情说道：“我亲爱的维克多，你怎么如此胡言乱语啊？亲爱的儿子，我求你再不要讲这种话了。”

“我没疯，”我奋力喊道，“看着我行动的太阳和苍天可以证明我的话是真实的。我就是杀害那些最清白无辜的牺牲者的凶手，他们是因为我的邪恶计划才死的。我宁愿一千次一滴一滴地流尽我的鲜血，只要能拯救他们的生命。我不能，我的父亲，我确实不能让整个人类都做牺牲。”

我这番话的结尾使父亲完全相信，我的思想一定是陷于狂乱了，他立刻改变了话题，努力把我的思路引到其他方向上去。他竭尽全力想把在爱尔兰经历的情景从我的记忆中抹掉，从此绝口不提它们，也不让我谈及自己所受的苦难。

随着时间的推移，我也变得比较平静了：痛苦已经深深地埋藏在心里，我也不再语无伦次地谈起自己的罪过了，意识到这一点也使我自己感到满意。我以最严酷的方式来遏制自己内心渴望向全世界惨痛呼号的声音。我的神情甚至比我从冰海回来后的任何时候还要显得平静和镇定。

在我们离开巴黎回瑞士的前几天，我接到了伊丽莎白的下面这封信——

我亲爱的朋友——收到了叔叔的巴黎来信，使我感到极大的快乐，你已没在遥不可及的远方，而且我有希望能在十来天后见到你了。我可怜的表哥，你一定经受了许多的磨难！我预料见到你的时候，你甚至会比离开日内瓦那会儿更憔悴。这个冬季的日子非常难过，因为我一直受到焦虑心情的折磨。不过我仍然盼望看到你面容安详，希望发现你的内心并没有完全失去安慰和宁静。

可是我还是担心，一年前使你那样痛苦的感情，现在依然还存在，甚至可能随时间流逝而加深了。现在如此众多的灾难还重压着你，我真不愿意打扰你，但是在叔叔离家之前我们曾谈过一次话，这使得在我们见面前做一些解释是必要的。

解释！你可能会说，伊丽莎白有什么要解释的呢？假如你真的这么说，我的问题便得到了答复，我的所有疑虑也就烟消云散了。可是你和我相距遥远，对我的解释，你可能会感到讨厌，也可能感到高兴，因为存在着这一可能性，所以我不敢再拖延地写了这封信，谈谈在你离家的日子里我常常希望向你表白，却又没有勇气开口讲的事情。

你清楚地知道，维克多，从我们的孩提时代起，我们的结合就一直是你父母的最大心愿。我们年轻的时候，他们就把这个愿望告诉了我们，并要我们把它当作理所当然的事情，期待着它的实现。我们在童年时期就是亲密的游伴，而且我相信，在长大成人之后，我们又是相互钟爱和彼此珍视的朋友。可是，兄妹之间往往怀有热烈感情而并不希望更亲密的结合，我们的情况可能也是这样吧？告诉我，亲爱的维克多，我恳求你，为了我们共同的幸福，真实地回答我——你是否爱着另一个人？

你长期出门旅行，你曾在英戈尔施塔特度过了许多年，而且我得坦率地向你承认，我的朋友，当我去年秋天见到你郁郁不乐、离群索居的时候，我就禁不住猜想你可能是在后悔我们的结合吧，同时你又感到尽管父母的意愿违背了你的心意，但你又有道义的责任来完成它。不过这只是毫无根据的推理。我要向你表白，我的朋友，我爱你，在我对未来的缥缈梦幻里，你始终是我忠贞不渝的朋友和伴侣。然而，正是因为我希望自己幸福，也同样希望你幸福，所以我要向你声明，我们的婚姻倘若不是出于你本人的自由选择，那它将使我永远痛苦。甚至现在，我也一边流泪一边想，像你这样已经被最残酷的厄运所压倒，唯有对爱情和幸福的希望才能使你复原，可是“道义”可能又会把这一切扑灭。我，对你怀着毫无私心的感情，却又可能成为你实现心愿的障碍，使你的痛苦加重十倍。啊！维克多，请你相信，你的表妹和游伴的爱是如此真诚，这种假设不能不使她感到难受。快乐起来吧，我的朋友，如果你应允我这唯一的请求，那么就完全不必顾虑，世界上没有任何力量能够扰乱我内心的宁静。

不要让这封信干扰你的心绪，假如答复我会给你带来痛苦，你用不着明天或者后天就回答，甚至回家以后也不必回答。叔叔会来信告诉我你的健康情况的，如果我们相见的时候，因为我的这一努力或其他的努力，我能在你唇上看见哪怕一丝笑意，我也就不再需要别的任何欢乐了。

伊丽莎白·拉文查

17××年5月18日，日内瓦

这封信在我的记忆里唤醒了一件早已遗忘了的事，那便是魔鬼的威吓——“在你的新婚之夜我会来找你的！”就是对我的判决，到那天晚上，魔鬼将采用所有的阴谋手段来毁灭我，把可能部分抚慰我的伤痛的一线幸福夺走。他已经决定，在那天晚上以我的死亡来圆满完成他的罪孽。好吧，但愿如此。到时候肯定将有一场生死搏斗，要是他胜利了，我就得到了安息，而他控制我的力量也就终结了。如果他被我击败，我就是个自由的人了。唉！那又是什么样的自由呢？正像一个农民，亲眼看见家人被杀戮，农舍被烧毁，土地变荒芜，自己漂泊异乡，无家可归，身无分文，孤苦伶仃，却又是自由的！我得到的将是这样的自由，只不过我还有伊丽莎白这一件珍宝，唉！悔恨和内疚所带来的恐惧感将抵消这一点幸福，并折磨我直到人生的终点。

可爱的、亲爱的伊丽莎白！我一读再读她的来信，某种温柔的感情偷偷潜入了我的心，悄悄唤起了对爱情和欢乐的幸福梦想，可是我已经吞下了罪恶之果，天使已经伸出手来夺去了我的一切希望。然而，为了她的幸福我宁愿去死。如果那个妖魔将他的威胁付诸实施的话，我的死一定是不可避免的，不过我又想，结婚会不会加速我的厄运呢。我的毁灭肯定会提前几个月到来的，但假如我因为他的威胁而推迟婚期，魔鬼也会有所怀疑，他一定会找出别的、也许更可怕的报复手段来。他曾发誓要在我的新婚之夜来找我，然而他并不认为那个威胁对他是一种约束，因此必须保证这段时间里我平安无事。而且他仿佛要让我明白他的嗜血欲望尚未满足，才在刚刚宣布了威吓之后便杀害了克莱瓦尔。因此，我毅然决定，只要我和表妹的结合能够有助于她的和我父亲的幸福，那么我的仇敌试图谋害我的任何阴谋，都不应该使我们的婚礼延迟哪怕一小时。

就在这样的情绪下，我给伊丽莎白写了回信。我信中的语气平静而充满了感情。“我担心，亲爱的姑娘，”我写道，“我们人生的欢乐留下的已经不多了，可是假如我有朝一日尚能享受到欢乐的话，那它就完全依赖于你了。驱散你那无谓的担忧吧，唯有对你，我愿献上我的生命和对幸福的追求。我只有一个秘密，伊丽莎白，一个可怕的秘密，假如告诉你，你将吓得周身冰凉，然后，你就绝不会对我的不幸感到吃惊了，而只会惊讶我居然能经受这一切活下来。在我们婚礼后的第二天，我会把这个悲惨而可怕的故事讲给你听的，因为，我可爱的表妹，这只能是我们之间知晓的秘密。不过我要请求你，在此之前你一定不要提起或暗示这件事情。我诚挚地恳求你做到这一点，而且我知道你是会这样做的。”

在伊丽莎白来信后大约一个礼拜，我们回到了日内瓦。那位可爱的姑娘热情地欢迎我，可是当她看到我消瘦的身躯和热病染红的双颊时，眼中不禁噙满了泪水。我也看出了她的变化。她更清瘦了，而且大大失去了过去使我着迷的那种天使般的活泼生气，不过，要做一个像我这样饱受摧残的不幸者的伴侣，她那种温柔的态度和充满同情的温和神情却显得更为适宜。

我在目前所享受到的宁静并没有持续多久。回忆又带来了精神的狂乱，我一想起经历过的一切，一种真正的疯狂又攫住了我。有时候我变得狂躁不安，大发雷霆；有时候我又情绪低落，郁郁寡欢。我不和任何人讲话，也不看任何人一眼，只是呆呆地坐着，因为巨大痛苦的压迫而神志茫然。

只有伊丽莎白才有力量使我从这些病态情绪中摆脱出来：我怒火燃烧的时候，她温柔的声音会来抚慰我；我陷于麻木的时候，她又用情感来激励我。她和我一起哭泣，也为我而哭泣。在我恢复理智的时候，她便规劝我，极力要我持顺从命运的态度。啊！对于不幸的人来说，顺从命运倒是合适的，可是对于有罪的人来说，根本就没有心灵的平静。沉湎于过度的悲痛有时候倒能使人得到某种感情的放纵，可是悔恨的剧烈痛楚却会毒化你的良心。

回家后不久，父亲就谈到了我和伊丽莎白马上结婚的事。我却一言不发。

“那么，你爱着别的什么人吗？”

“绝对没有。我爱伊丽莎白，并且快乐地盼望着我们的结合。那就定下日子来好了，到那一天我将把自己奉献给表妹的幸福，不论我是死是活。”

“我亲爱的维克多，不要这么说。深重的灾难已降临在我们头上，可是让我们更珍视留下的一切吧，把我们对已死者的爱转移到仍然活着的人身上来。我们的生活圈子会很小，但相互间被感情和共同不幸的纽带连接得很紧。当时光流逝缓和了你的绝望心情以后，值得你关切的新的、可珍爱的事物又会产生，替代你被如此残酷地剥夺了的一切。”

这就是父亲的教诲。可是对魔鬼威胁的记忆却回到了我的心头，魔鬼在施行血腥勾当的时候简直是无所不能，所以我几乎把他看作不可战胜的了，对这一点你不会感到奇怪的。当他说出“在你的新婚之夜我会来找你的”这句话的时候，我自然认为他用以恐吓我的厄运是难以逃避的。不过和失去伊丽莎白相比，死亡对于我来说就算不上是什么灾难了，因此，我带着满意的、甚至是兴高采烈的表情同意了父亲的意见，答应如果表妹愿意的话我们就在十天后举行婚礼。我想，这也就决定了我的命运。

上帝啊！哪怕我只有一瞬刻想到了那残忍的仇敌用心的险恶，我将宁肯把自己永远放逐异国，做一个无亲无友漂泊四方的流浪者，也不会应允这不幸的婚事了。然而，我却像被魔法迷住了一样，竟然没能看透魔鬼的真实意图，就在我以为是在准备自己的死亡的时候，我却在加速一个更亲爱的人的牺牲。

随着婚礼日期逐渐临近，不知是因为胆怯还是出于某种预感，我感到心情极为沮丧。不过我用强颜欢笑来掩饰自己的感情，这使得父亲的脸上也露出了笑意和欢乐，但它不能瞒过伊丽莎白那关注而精细的眼光。她怀着宁静的满足心情瞻望着我们的结合，但又混杂着以往的不幸所刻下的几许忧虑，她担心目前看来似乎确凿无疑、伸手可及的幸福不久就会烟消云散，除了绵绵不绝的深重悔恨以外，将留不下一点踪影。

为婚礼进行了种种准备，接待了前来祝贺的客人，一切都显得喜气扬扬。我竭尽全力隐藏起吞噬着内心的焦虑不安，佯装热切地履行父亲的所有安排，尽管这一切可能只在装点着我的悲剧。通过父亲的努力，奥地利政府归还了伊丽莎白应该继承的部分遗产。科莫湖畔的一小片房产现在属于她了。我们商量好了，婚礼之后立即动身去拉文查别墅，在别墅附近美丽的湖畔度过我们最初几天幸福的时光。

与此同时，我采取了一切措施来保护自己，以对付魔鬼的公开袭击。我身边随时携带着手枪和匕首，时刻防范着他耍出什么花招来，由于有了这些防备，我也镇静了许多。说句真话，随着那个日子的逼近，魔鬼的威吓显得更像一种幻觉，仿佛不值得我为此而影响自己的平静，因为预定举行结婚仪式的日子越来越近，我听到人们不断地谈论它，好像它是任何力量也不可阻止的事情，于是我所盼望的婚姻幸福也就愈加显得确定无疑了。

伊丽莎白显得也很快乐，我的平静态度大大有助于她的精神镇定。不过到了实现我的愿望和决定我的命运的那一天，她却陷入了忧郁，充满了不祥的预感，也许她想起了我许诺在第二天向她披露的那个可怕的秘密吧。我的父亲在这段时间里则过于欣喜，忙于准备婚事，只把侄女的忧郁当作是新娘的羞怯。

婚礼之后，在父亲家里又举行了一个盛大宴会，不过我和伊丽莎白商量好了，我们要乘船旅行，当晚住在伊维安，第二天又继续航行。那天天气晴朗，风向很好，万物都在为我们的蜜月旅行展颜欢笑。

这是我享受人生幸福感情的最后时刻了。我们的船飞速航行，阳光灼热，但是有船篷为我们遮阴，我们欣赏着美丽的景色，有时在湖的一侧，我们看见了萨勒维峰，蒙塔勒格那秀丽的两岸，远处是俯瞰一切的美丽的勃朗峰，以及徒然地和它一争高低的绵绵雪山；有时沿着湖的对岸航行，我们又看见巨大的尤拉山以它黑黝黝的峭壁阻止了人们离弃祖国的企图，同时又成为妄图奴役这个国家的侵略者所不可逾越的障碍。

我握住伊丽莎白的手说：“你显得很忧伤，我亲爱的。啊！要是你知道我受过怎样的折磨，还可能再经受什么苦难，你就会尽量让我品味一下至少今天还能享受到的宁静和自由了。”

“快乐起来吧，维克多，”伊丽莎白回答道，“我希望没有任何东西会带给你苦恼。请你放心，如果说在我的脸上看不到欢悦的话，我的心却是满足的。有一种声音在我耳边轻声说，不要太相信眼前展示的美好前景，不过我是不会理会这种不祥之言的。你看我们航行得多快呀，云朵一会儿掩蔽了勃朗峰的圆顶，一会儿又升腾上去，使得这一派美景更显得饶有趣味了。再看看那些在清澈的水中游泳的数也数不清的鱼儿吧，我们还能看清水底的每一颗卵石呢。多么神奇的日子！整个大自然显得多么欢乐和宁静啊！”

伊丽莎白就这样努力使她和我的思绪从令人忧郁的题目上转移开去。不过她的情绪一直是波动起伏的，欢乐在她的眼光里闪烁片刻以后，又总是被恍惚不定的神情所取代。

夕阳已低低沉落，我们经过了德朗斯河，看到它怎样蜿蜒穿越高山间的峡谷和小山间的沟壑。在这里阿尔卑斯山紧贴着湖水，我们已经接近了围绕它的东麓的半圆形群山。在环山的树林和重重叠叠的山岭中，伊维安教堂的尖顶在熠熠闪光。

沿途以惊人的速度吹送我们前进的那阵风，到日落时分减弱为一派和风，在我们接近湖岸的时候，它轻柔得只能吹皱湖水，拂动树丛微微地摇摆，并从岸边吹过来花朵和干草的惬意的馨香。到我们登岸时，夕阳坠落下了地平线。我一踏上湖岸，便立即感到忧虑和恐惧回到了心里，不久就会抓住我，永远缠住我。





第二十三章　最后的灾难


在八点钟的时候我们上了岸。我们先在湖畔散了一会儿步，欣赏转瞬即逝的夕照，然后回到了旅店，静观湖水、树林和山峦构成的可爱景色，它们虽然在黑暗中显得朦胧不清，但依然展示出黑黝黝的轮廓。

南边的风已经减弱了，现在它又从西边猛烈地吹了过来。月亮已升到了天顶，正在开始向下沉落，朵朵云团比兀鹰飞翔还要迅疾地掠过它的表面，使它的光辉变得黯淡了，湖面则倒映着天空纷乱的景象，刚刚开始涌起的不平静的波浪使这派纷乱景象愈加纷乱。突然之间，暴雨从天而降。

在白天我一直保持着镇静，可是当黑夜使一切化为漆黑一片的时候，千百种忧虑便涌上了心头。我变得十分焦虑和警惕，右手紧握着藏在怀中的一支手枪，每一个声响都让我感到惊慌，不过我下定决心绝不能毫无代价地丧失生命，绝不畏惧拼死搏斗，直至我自己的生命或者仇敌的生命毁灭为止。

伊丽莎白已经注意到了我的焦躁不安，但她畏怯而恐惧地保持着沉默，不过在我的眼神里有什么使她感到了恐慌，于是她颤抖着问我：“你为什么这么焦虑呢，我亲爱的维克多？你害怕什么啊？”

“啊！别担心，我亲爱的，”我回答道，“今天夜里一切都会平安无事，不过这个夜晚倒真是让人害怕，让人胆战心惊。”

我在这种精神状态下度过了一个钟头，猛然想到时刻可能发生的那场搏斗对我的妻子将是何等的恐怖，于是我恳求她回房间去休息，决定等到我对敌手的情况有了一定了解以后再到她那儿去。

她离开了，然后我就在房子的各个通道里来回走了一阵子，查看了每一个可供敌手隐藏的角落。不过我没有发现他的任何踪迹，于是开始猜测或许因为什么幸运的偶然机缘，阻止了他来实施他的恐吓。就在这时候，我突然听见一声尖利的可怕叫喊。它是从伊丽莎白进去休息的那间屋子里传出来的。我一听见这声叫喊，顿时明白了真相，我的双臂垂下了，每条肌肉每根纤维都无力动弹了，我能感觉到血液在血管里缓慢地流动，刺痛着我四肢的末梢。这种状态只不过持续了一瞬刻，又传来一声尖叫，于是我冲进了那个房间。

上帝啊！我为什么不在那一刻死去呢！为什么我还在这儿讲述自己最美好的希望和世界上最纯洁的生命的毁灭呢？伊丽莎白就在那儿，毫无生气地一动不动，她躺在床上，头垂了下来，头发半掩着她那苍白而扭曲的脸。直到现在，我无论朝哪儿看，都只看见同一个景象——伊丽莎白那毫无血色的手臂和衰颓无力的躯体，被凶手扔在她新婚的灵床上。难道我目睹这一切还能再活下去吗？唉！在最厌弃生命的时候，生命却顽固地紧紧缠着不放手。就在一瞬刻间，我失去了记忆力，我毫无知觉地倒在了地上。

当我苏醒的时候，我发现旅店的人围绕着我，他们的神情都表现出极度的恐惧，可是局外人的恐惧和压迫着我内心的感情相比真是轻若鸿毛。我逃离了他们，回到了伊丽莎白躺着的房间。我的爱，我的妻子，刚才还那么富于生气，那么可爱，那么珍贵。她已经被人挪动了，改变了我最初见到的姿势，现在她头枕着一只手臂躺在那儿，一张手帕覆盖着她的脸和脖子，我几乎认为她是睡着了。我向她冲过去，热烈地拥抱她，然而她死一般无力的躯体和冰凉的四肢告诉我，我怀中拥抱着的已不再是我深深钟爱的伊丽莎白了。魔鬼那致死的手指印还留在她的脖子上，她的唇间已没有了呼吸。

当我怀着绝望的痛苦站在她身前的时候，我偶然地抬起头来望了一眼。房间的百叶窗原先是掩蔽好了的，现在我却看见淡黄的月光照亮了房间，不禁感到一阵惊慌。百叶窗已经被打开了，而且，我带着难以形容的恐惧感看见，在打开的窗户前站着那个最可怕和最可憎的怪物。怪物的脸上露出了狞笑，他用那恶魔的手指指着我妻子的尸体，仿佛是在嘲笑我。我冲向窗前，并从怀中抽出了手枪，开了一枪，可是他闪开了，从他站的地方跳开去，以闪电般的速度跑向湖边，一跃身扎进了水里。

枪声引得一大群人来到我的房间里。我向他们指出了怪物逃匿的方向，随后我们就乘了几条小船去跟踪追击，我们还撒了网，但一无所获。过了几个钟头，我们失望地返回了，大多数人认为这事是出自我的幻觉。登岸以后，他们还继续在乡间搜索了一阵，在树林和葡萄园里分头查找。

我本来试图和他们一道去，而且从旅店出来走了一小段路，可是我感到天旋地转，步伐踉跄犹如一个醉汉，最后精疲力竭地倒下了。我的眼前一片模糊，周身发着高热，皮肤滚烫。我就这样被人们抬了回去，放到床上，自己几乎不知道发生了什么事。我的眼睛漫无目标地在房间里四面张望，就好像在寻找什么遗失了的东西。

稍微歇了一会儿我就爬起来，仿佛凭着本能似的，我缓慢地走到了我心爱的人躺着的那个房间。有些女人正围着她哭泣——我站到遗体前，和她们一起抛洒着悲伤的眼泪。在这整段时间里，我的脑子里没有任何明晰的观念，思想只在各种各样的事件上绕来绕去，纷乱无序地思考着我的不幸以及原因所在。我在一团惊愕和恐惧的迷雾中茫然若失。威廉的死，于斯丁的被处决，克莱瓦尔的被谋杀，最后是我妻子遭到杀害，甚至在这一刻，我还不知道其余的亲人们是否躲过了魔鬼的毒手，我的父亲现在也许正在他的魔掌下挣扎着，欧内斯特也许已经死在了他的脚下。这个念头使我不寒而栗，提醒我必须采取行动。我一跃而起，决定尽快地赶回日内瓦。

这时弄不到马车，我不得不乘船从湖上走，可是遇到了逆风，而且暴雨如注。不过天还刚刚破晓，我还有希望在晚上赶到家里。我雇了一个人来划船，自己也操起了一把桨，我过去常常体会到身体的活动可以减轻精神上的痛苦。可是我现在满怀悲痛，心中过分焦虑，使不出半点力气。我扔下了船桨，用双手抱着头，只好向涌上心头的阴郁感情屈服了。只要我抬起头来，便看见我在欢乐的时刻所熟悉的那些景物，只不过在昨天，我还和她在一起观赏着这一切，而如今她已只是一个影子、一段回忆了。泪水不禁从我的眼中涌流而出。雨刚才已经停了，我看见鱼儿就像几个小时以前那样在水里嬉戏着，那时候伊丽莎白也在观看着它们啊！对人类心灵来说，再也没有比如此巨大而突然的变故更令人伤痛的了。阳光还会灿烂，云彩还会低飞，然而一切在我眼里再也不会像昨天那样了。魔鬼已经从我这里夺走了一切对于未来幸福的希望。从没有任何人像我这样的不幸，在人类的历史上也再没有像这样可怕的事件了。

我还有什么必要再细细讲述在这次最重大的事件之后的种种情况了呢？我的故事一直充满了恐怖，而现在它已经到达了顶点，后面不得不讲的事只能让你感到乏味了。要知道，我的亲友们一个接一个地被夺走了，我的处境已是无限凄凉。我的力量已经衰竭，因此我只得简略地讲述这骇人听闻的故事的剩余部分。

我到了日内瓦。父亲和欧内斯特还活着，不过父亲听到我带来的消息就完全垮了。我现在还仿佛看见他在我眼前，一个不寻常的、可敬的老人！他的眼光茫然失神，因为已经丧失了过去使之陶醉和欢欣的力量——他的伊丽莎白，那胜似女儿的姑娘，他曾以男人最大的慈祥钟爱着她，而在他垂暮之年所余感情不多的时候，又特别执着于这些仅剩的情感。那该诅咒的魔鬼，竟给白发老人带来不幸，让他不得不凄惨地耗竭生命！他在身边屡屡发生恐怖惨案的情况下再也活不下去了，生命的源泉突然干涸了，他再也起不了床，几天后便在我怀中去世。

我后来怎样了呢？我不知道。我丧失了知觉，只感到镣铐和黑暗在压迫着我。有时候，我也确实梦见过和我青年时代的伙伴们在繁花盛开的草地上或风光宜人的山谷里漫游，但醒来的时候，却发现自己在一间牢房中。此后我又陷入了忧郁，不过我还是渐渐地对自己的不幸处境有了清晰的概念，人们这才从牢房中把我释放出来。因为大家都说我疯了，据我所知，有好几个月我是被囚禁在一间单人牢房里。

要不是我恢复了理智，同时也恢复了报仇的决心，自由对我而言本会是一份毫无意义的赠礼。由于对过去不幸遭遇的回忆沉重地压着我，我便开始思考它们的根源——我亲手创造的那个魔鬼，我释放到世间来毁灭我自己的那个卑鄙的恶魔。我一想到他就充满了疯狂的愤怒，我渴望并热切地祈求能把他牢牢抓在手中，砸碎他那该诅咒的脑袋来雪我深仇大恨。

我的仇恨并没有长期局限于空洞无用的愿望，我开始思考抓住他的最好的办法。为了这一目的，我在获释后大约一个月，便去拜访了城里一位刑事法官，告诉他说我要提出一项指控，我知道杀害我一家的凶手是谁，我请求他运用他的全部职权拘捕那个杀人犯。

法官专注而和蔼地听我说完了这番话。“请放心，先生，”他说，“我将不遗余力地搜捕那个歹徒。”

“我谢谢你，”我回答道，“那么，请你听取我下面提出的证词。这确实是一个非常离奇的故事，要不是因为有某种尽管不可思议却又确凿无疑的真实性的话，你或许是不会相信的。这个故事紧密连贯，不至于被当作梦魇，而且我并没有任何动机需要撒谎。”在我向他讲这番话的时候，态度十分感人，但又非常镇静，我在心里已经狠下决心，一定要追踪那个凶手并置之死地。怀着这个目标，我的痛苦也就有所减轻了，并且暂时又有了活下去的意愿。于是我用简洁的但又是坚定和准确的语言讲述了我的故事，精确地标明各种事件的日期，而且绝不偏移到咒骂和感叹的方向上去。

法官开始时似乎完全不相信我的话，不过当我继续往下讲的时候，他便表现出越来越强烈的关注和兴趣了。我看到他一会儿恐惧得发起抖来，一会儿脸上又流露出强烈的惊讶表情，其中没有掺杂着丝毫的怀疑。

我在结束叙述的时候说道：“我要指控的就是他，我吁请你行使你的全部权力将他拘捕和严惩。这是你作为行政官的责任，而且我相信并希望你出于人的情感，在这一案件中不会拒绝履行你的职责。”

这番话在我的听讲者的面容上激起了显著的变化。他在听我的叙述时，原本带着听鬼怪故事和奇闻逸事时的那种半信半疑的态度，现在，当我要求他据以采取官方行动的时候，他心中的怀疑倾向又抬头了。不过他还是很温和地回答我说：“我非常愿意为你的追捕提供一切帮助，可是你所说的那个家伙似乎有本领来对抗我的任何努力。谁能够追踪一个可以横穿冰海、居住在任何人也不敢侵入的岩穴山洞里的怪物呢？此外，在他实施罪行之后已经过去了几个月，谁也猜不到他跑到哪里去了，现在又居住在什么地方。”

“我毫不怀疑，他就在我的住所附近出没，即使他真的逃进了阿尔卑斯山，我们也可以像捕捉羚羊一样把他抓到，并像杀死野兽一样把他消灭。不过我领会到了你的想法，你并不相信我的叙述，也不打算抓捕我的仇敌，给他以应得的惩罚。”

我说这番话的时候，怒火就在我的眼中燃烧，法官被吓着了。“你弄错了，”他说，“我会尽力的，要是我有力量抓住那个魔鬼的话，请你放心，他一定会受到与他的罪行相当的惩罚。不过我担心，根据你所形容的那个怪物的特性来看，这种想法是不切合实际的，因此，我们要采取一切适当的措施，但你也要做好思想准备去面对失望。”

“绝不会如此，可是我不管怎么说也是徒费口舌而已。我的复仇对于你来说是无足轻重的，不过，尽管我承认复仇是件坏事，但我要坦言，它已经成了吞噬我的灵魂的唯一强烈情感。当我想到自己释放到人类社会里来的那个杀人恶魔还活着，我心中的愤怒简直是无法形容的。你拒绝了我的正当要求，我现在只有一个办法了。我将为他的毁灭而付出我自己，不管是死是活。”

我一边这样说，一边激动得浑身颤抖。我不怀疑，在我的神情中有几分狂乱，还有几分据说是古代殉道者所特有的那种狂傲的凶悍。不过对于一个日内瓦的行政官来说，他的头脑里装的东西远非这种献身精神和英雄气概，我的崇高思想在他看来太像某种疯狂的表现了。他像保姆哄孩子那样极力安慰我，把我的故事当作谵妄狂想的产物。

“嗨，”我喊道，“你自诩聪明却多么无知啊！住嘴吧，你自己也不知道在说些什么。”

我气愤而烦躁地冲出了那所房子，回去细细思考怎么采取其他的行动。





第二十四章　追踪仇敌


在我目前的处境中，一切主观意志所能控制的思想都被吞没了、消失了。我被狂怒驱赶着，只有复仇的意愿给了我力量和自我控制力，它规范着我的情感，在我本该陷于狂乱或死亡的时候，是复仇的欲望使我得以深谋远虑和保持冷静。

我的第一个决定是永远离开日内瓦。当我幸福而且为人所爱的时候，祖国对于我来说是可亲的，而现在我苦难深重，祖国也变得可憎了。我带上了一笔钱，再加上原来属于母亲的一些珠宝，离开了祖国。

我的流浪生活由此开始了，只有我的生命结束时它才会终止。我穿越了世界上广袤的地区，忍受了旅行者们在沙漠和野蛮国度里惯常遭遇到的一切艰险困苦。我几乎不知道自己是怎么活下来的，有多少次，我四肢无力地长躺在沙地上，但求一死。然而复仇的欲望使我活着，我不敢就此死去，而让我的仇敌继续活着。

离开日内瓦的时候，我做的第一件事便是想找到一些线索，借以追寻我那恶魔般的敌人的踪迹。不过我并无明确的计划，只是在城郊绕了许多钟头的圈子，弄不清到底该走哪条路。当夜晚来临时，我发现自己正站在威廉、伊丽莎白和父亲安息的那片公墓的入口处。我走了进去，来到了标志着他们的坟墓的墓碑前。一切都归于寂静，只有树叶被风吹动而沙沙作响，夜色近乎漆黑，这一派景象即使对于一个漠然的旁观者来说，也是肃穆庄严而令人感动的。亡者的精灵仿佛在周遭徘徊，并在哀悼者的头上投下了一道可以感觉到而看不见的阴影。

这种情景最初在我心里激起的深切哀痛很快就让位于愤慨和绝望了。他们死去了，而我却活着，杀害他们的凶手也活着，为了消灭他，我不得不苟延我毫无意趣的生命。我在草地上跪下，吻着脚下的泥土，哆嗦着嘴唇高声说：“凭着我膝下的神圣大地，凭着在我身边游荡的幽灵，凭着我心中深切而无尽的哀痛，我发誓，而且凭着你，啊，黑夜，以及统治着你的精灵，我发誓要追寻那个酿成这一场灾难的魔鬼，直至他或者我在殊死搏斗中灭亡为止。为了这个目的，我将保存自己的生命，只是为了这代价高昂的复仇，我才愿意再见到太阳，再踏上大地的绿草，否则我唯愿它们从我眼前永远消失。我呼唤你们，亡者的精灵，我也呼唤你们，漫游的复仇之神，望你们助我一臂之力，指引我去行动。让那个该诅咒的地狱里的妖魔受尽痛苦，让他也感受到现在折磨着我的绝望吧。”

开始起誓的时候，我怀着庄严肃穆而凛然敬畏的感情，自己几乎相信那些被害亲友的幽灵一定听到了并赞许我的祈愿，然而在我结束的时候，狂怒又攫住了我，愤慨噎得我说不出话来了。

在黑夜的寂静中，忽然有一声响亮的恐怖笑声来回答我的誓言。它久久地、深沉地在我耳边震响，群山反射着它的回声，我觉得仿佛周围就是地狱，到处是嘲弄和嬉笑。要不是我已经发出了誓言并且决心要复仇的话，在那一瞬刻我完全可能陷于疯狂，毁灭了自己这可悲的生命。笑声渐渐消失，这时有一个很熟悉的可憎的声音，似乎贴近我的耳际清晰可辨地悄声说道：“我很满意，倒霉的可怜虫！你决定要活下去，我很满意。”

我猛扑向这声音发出的地方，可是魔鬼闪开了。突然间一轮满月升了起来，清晰地照亮了他那可怕的畸形身躯，这时他正以惊人的速度飞逃而去。

我跟踪追寻他，有好几个月我就做着这件事。根据一点渺茫的线索，我沿着曲折的隆河搜寻，可是一无所获。蔚蓝的地中海出现在我的眼前，凭着一个偶然的机会，我看见他在夜里爬上了一艘驶往黑海的船，藏在船上。我也登上了这艘船，可是他又逃走了，我不知道他是怎么逃掉的。

在鞑靼和俄罗斯的荒野中，尽管他仍然躲避着我，我却一直紧跟着他的行踪。有时候，被这个可怕的鬼怪吓到的农民们把他的路线告诉我，他担心我找不到他的踪迹会绝望而死，所以故意留下一些印记来指引我。我的头上大雪纷飞，在银白色的原野上，我看到他那硕大的脚印。对你这样初涉人世、不知忧虑痛苦为何物的人来说，怎么能理解我感受过并仍在感受着的这一切呢？寒冷、匮乏和疲惫只是我命定要经受的种种痛楚中最轻微的。我受到魔鬼的诅咒，背着永恒的地狱，然而仍有善良的精灵在跟随着我，为我指引着方向。当我怨天尤人时，他会突然将我从似乎不可克服的困苦中解救出来。有时，当饥饿弄得我精力枯竭时，荒漠中会准备好了一餐饭食，振作起我的力量和精神。那食物的确是很粗糙的，就和当地农民们吃的东西一样，但我绝不怀疑那是我所祈求的精灵放在那儿的。而且常常有这样的情况，当大地干旱，天上不见一丝云，我渴得口舌冒火的时候，会有一片乌云遮住天空，洒下几滴雨水令我复苏，随后又消失得无影无踪了。

我总是尽可能地沿着河道走，而魔鬼却老是避开河道，因为这些地方是人口密集的区域，在其他地方则很少看见人的踪影。我一般是靠捕捉偶然碰见的野兽维持生命。我也带着钱，把钱分给村民们可以获得他们的帮助。我也带着我捕杀的猎物，自己吃一小部分，把其余的送给那些提供烹煮炉灶和用具的人家。

像这样艰难度日确实让我感到厌恶，只有在睡梦中我才能体味到欢乐。啊，幸福的睡梦！在最痛苦的时候，我常常躺下来睡觉，我的梦境给我抚慰，甚至让我欢悦。守护着我的精灵们给了我这些快乐的瞬间，或者一段快乐的时光，使我能够保持力量来完成自己的漫长旅程。没有这些短暂的休歇，我可能早已被艰难困苦压倒了。白天，我以对夜晚的渴盼来支撑自己，激励自己，因为在睡梦中我会见到我的亲友，我的妻子和我可爱的祖国，我能见到父亲那慈爱的面容，听到伊丽莎白那银铃般的声音，看到青春焕发的克莱瓦尔。在我被艰难跋涉弄得精疲力竭的时候，我总是极力要让自己相信当时是在梦中，而到了夜晚，在我亲爱的人的怀抱里才是在享受现实的欢乐。我对他们怀着怎样的痛苦的爱恋啊！甚至在白天他们也总在我身边，我是怎样眷恋着他们可爱的形象，并要自己相信他们仍然活着！在这样的时刻，我心中燃烧的复仇之火便消失了，而我之所以继续前进去消灭那个魔鬼，也更是把它当作上天赋予的使命，更是出于某种我不了解的机械性的冲动，而并非是自己心灵的热切欲望了。

我所追踪的那个魔鬼的心情怎样，我不可能了解。有时候，他确实在树皮上写些字或在石头上刻些字，给我指路，同时也激起我的怒火。“我的统治尚未结束”（在一处刻痕中可以看清这句话）；“你活着，我便拥有充分的权力。跟着我，我要去北方千年不化的冰国，你将在那里经受严寒冰霜的折磨，而我却毫不在意。假如你跟我不算太慢，那你将在附近找到一只死野兔，吃了它恢复体力。来吧，我的仇敌，我们还要进行一场生死搏斗呢，不过在那个时刻到来以前，你必须忍受许多悲惨的时日。”

你这幸灾乐祸的魔鬼！我再次发誓要复仇，我要让你受尽折磨而死，卑鄙的妖魔。我绝不会放弃我的追踪，直到他或我灭亡为止。到那时，我将何等欣喜地和伊丽莎白以及死去的亲友们相聚啊，即便是现在，他们已经在准备着报偿我这漫长的苦役和可怕的旅程了！

当我继续向北方前进时，冰雪更深更厚，天气愈加寒冷，几乎到了无法忍受的程度。农民们都龟缩在小屋里，只有最能吃苦耐劳的少数人才敢于冒险出门，去捕捉被饥饿逼迫跑出藏身地来觅食的动物。河面结满了冰，根本捉不到鱼，这样我就失去了维持生命的主要食物。

随着我的旅程越来越困苦，我的仇敌也愈加得意扬扬。他留下的话中有一句是这样的：“准备好！你的苦活儿才刚刚开始。裹紧皮衣，带好粮食。因为在我们即将踏上的旅途里你将受尽苦难，使我永不消泯的仇恨获得满足。”

这些嘲弄的话语激发了我的勇气和毅力，我下定决心一定要达到目的，我祈求上天保佑我，继续怀着毫不衰退的热情穿越无垠的沙漠，直到大海出现在远方尽头的地平线上。啊！这片海洋和南方蔚蓝的海洋是多么不同！它的表面被冰封住，只能根据那无比的荒凉和崎岖不平的表层来判断它并非陆地。当年的希腊人在亚洲的山峦上望见地中海时曾喜极而泣，欣喜若狂地欢呼艰难历程的终结。我却没有哭泣，我只是跪下来，激动万分地感激引路的精灵把我平安地带到了这里，不管我的仇敌怎么嘲笑我，现在我终于可以和他面对面地决一死战了。

此前的几个礼拜，我弄到了一辆雪橇和几只狗，因此我便用难以想象的速度穿越那一片雪原。我不知道魔鬼是否也获得了这个便利条件，不过，如果说过去我跟踪他每天都要落到后面的话，现在我发现自己能赶上他了。这样看来，在我刚看见大海的时候，他不过快我一天的路程，现在我有希望在他到达海滩之前截住他。因此我怀着新增的勇气继续追赶，两天后来到了海滨的一个破烂的小村子。我向居民们询问有关那个魔鬼的情况，得到了确切的信息。他们说，前一天夜里有个身躯庞大的怪物来过，还带着一支长枪和好几支手枪，那副可怕的模样把一个孤立的茅舍里的住户吓得逃跑了。他搬走了他们储存的过冬的食物，放在一辆雪橇里，为了拉雪橇还牵走了一群受过训练的狗，把它们套上，当晚，吓坏了的村民高兴地发现他又继续赶路了，穿过冰海向不通往任何陆地的方向走去。他们猜想，他一定会很快送命的，不死于冰层的断裂，也会被永恒不变的严寒冻死。

听到了这个消息，我不免一时感到绝望。他逃脱了我的追踪，而我必须开始一次毁灭性的、几乎没有尽头的旅程，不得不跨过海上的冰山——那种严寒即使是当地居民也很少有人能够长期忍受的，而像我这样在温暖而晴朗的气候里生长的人简直没有希望幸存。然而，我一想到那个魔鬼还活着并且扬扬得意，愤怒和复仇的情绪便又高涨起来，就像汹涌巨浪压倒了任何其他感情。在我稍事休息的时候，死者的精灵仿佛在我周围徘徊着，激励我不畏艰苦去复仇，休息之后我就为继续赶路做好准备。

我用自己的陆地雪橇换了一辆为崎岖不平的冰海特制的雪橇，并购置了充裕的粮食，接着就驶离了陆地。

我估算不出从那时候起又经过了多少日子，只记得自己经受了无穷的苦难，只有我心中永远燃烧着的正义的复仇之火才支撑着我承受住了这一切。巨大而崎岖难行的冰山常常阻拦了我的道路，我还时常听见海啸的轰鸣似乎在威胁着要毁灭我的生命。不过严寒又再度降临了，海上的通路又变得安全了。

从我消耗了的食物数量来判断，我猜想自己已经在这段路程上走了三个礼拜了。我心里再次想到希望总是不能实现，沮丧和悲痛之泪便常常从眼中滚滚跌落。的确，绝望几乎控制了我，在这种痛苦中我一定会很快倒下的。有一次，那些可怜的狗经过难以置信的艰苦努力把我拉到了冰山斜坡的顶上，一只狗疲惫地倒下死去了。我极度痛苦地眺望着前面的广袤冰海，就在这时我突然看到在昏暗的冰原上有一个黑点。我聚集目光去看清那是什么东西，终于辨认出一辆雪橇和雪橇上坐着的那个熟悉的畸形躯体，不禁狂喜地大叫。啊！希望在心头是怎样熊熊燃烧起来了啊！热泪充盈了我的双眼，我急忙擦掉泪水，以免影响了我紧盯着魔鬼的视线，可是滚热的泪水仍然模糊了我的视野，到最后我只得屈服于压在心头的感情，放声大哭起来。

不过这可不是容许延误的时候，我从狗群里解下了死狗，让它们饱餐了一顿。我休息了一个钟头，这是绝对必要的，可我对此仍然极不乐意，随后我就继续上路了。那辆雪橇还看得见，我也绝不让它在眼前消失，除非有时某座冰山突出的岩石暂时挡住了我的视线。我确实感觉到自己在与它接近，又过了两天的行程，我看到仇敌距我只不过有一英里远了，我的心便怦怦跳起来。

可是，就在我几乎要抓住我的敌人的时候，希望却突然破灭了，有关他的一切踪迹都消失了，比过去任何时候都要消失得更彻底。我听见了一阵海啸，深海潜流正在行进，仿佛浪涛就在我脚下翻滚汹涌，它的轰鸣声时时刻刻发出不祥的预兆和恐吓。我奋力前行，但徒劳无益。风吹得愈加猛烈，海在高声咆哮，冰海就像受到地震的强烈撼动一样迸裂开来，发出惊天动地的巨响。一切很快就完结了，几分钟以后，一片汹涌翻滚的大海横亘在我和我的仇敌之间，我留在一块碎冰上漂浮着，冰块在不断地缩小，为我准备下了一条可怕的死亡之路。

我就这样度过了惊心动魄的几个钟头，几只狗死去了，我自己也差不多要在越来越沉重的哀痛打击下死亡，就在这时，我看见了你们这艘抛锚的船，它给了我获救和生存的希望。我根本想不到会有船只航行到这么遥远的北极来，看到它使我极为震惊。我急忙拆掉雪橇的一部分做成了船桨，借助这种办法，我用尽疲惫之力划着自己的冰筏向你们的船靠近。我做出了决定，假如你们要向南航行的话，我就宁可把自己交给大海处置，也绝不放弃自己的目标。我只希望能说动你们给我一只小船，让我驾着它去追赶我的敌人。不过你们的航行方向是朝北的。你们救我上船时，我已经精疲力竭，本来会很快在重重苦难的折磨下死去的，而我仍然不愿死——因为我的任务还没有完成。

啊！我的守护精灵什么时候才会把我带领到魔鬼的面前，并让我得到我如此渴望的内心安宁呢？难道我非得死去而他仍然活着吗？假如我真要死去，你要向我起誓，沃尔顿，不能让魔鬼逃掉，你一定要找到他，以他的死来满足我的复仇欲望。难道我真的敢于要求你接替我的任务，去经受我经历过的那些苦难吗？不，我还不至于如此自私。不过，在我死了之后，假如他竟敢出现，假如复仇之神把他引到了你的面前，你要发誓不让他活下去——绝不能让他在我无尽的苦难面前趾高气扬，并活着变本加厉地施行他那黑暗的罪恶。他能言善辩，很会蛊惑人心，他的话也曾打动过我的心，可是你不要相信他。他的灵魂和他的形象是一样的丑恶凶狠，满肚子的阴谋诡计和狠毒伎俩。不要听信他的话，你要呼喊着威廉、于斯丁、克莱瓦尔、伊丽莎白、我父亲和悲惨的维克多的名字，用你的利剑刺穿他的心脏。我的精灵将在你身边徘徊，指引你的剑锋正中目标。





续前信　致萨维尔夫人


你已经读完了这个奇异而可怕的故事，玛格丽特，你是否像我甚至现在还害怕得浑身冰凉一样，感到自己恐惧得连血液也凝固了？有时候，他被突发的痛楚攫住了，无法继续讲他的故事；有时候，他又以嘶哑然而尖锐的声音艰难地说着那些充满痛苦的话语。他那双明澈可爱的眼睛一时因愤慨而闪闪发亮，一时又堕入颓丧苦恼，在无尽的哀痛中黯然失色。有时候他会控制住表情语调，以平静的声音叙述最可怕的事件，不显示任何激动的征兆，接下来他又像火山喷发，面容突然改变为狂怒的表情，并对他的迫害者发出尖声咒骂。

他的故事情节连贯，他叙述的时候就像在讲朴素的事实，不过我得承认，不管他讲得多么诚恳而有条理，他给我看的费利克斯和沙菲之间的通信，以及我们从船上看到的那个怪物的身影，比他自己所声称的更令我确信那是事实。这样看来，真的有这么一个怪物了！我无法怀疑这一点，不过我还是惊讶和感叹得难以自持。有时候我极力想从弗兰肯斯坦那儿打听有关创造生命的细节，可是在这一点上他的态度是绝不动摇的。

“难道你疯了不成，我的朋友？”他说，“你无知的好奇心把你引到哪里去了？你也要为你自己和整个世界造出一个恶魔般的敌人吗？冷静下来，冷静下来！从我的苦难中吸取教训吧，不要给自己增添不幸。”

弗兰肯斯坦发现我记录下了他的故事，他要求看看我的笔记，然后在不少地方亲自做了修改和补充，不过主要是使自己和仇敌之间的谈话更加生动传神。“既然你保存了我叙述的故事，”他说，“我不愿流传于后代的是个残缺不全的东西。”

一个礼拜就这样过去了，在此期间我听到了人类想象力所能产生出的最奇异的故事。我的思想，我心灵中的每一种感情，都完全被我的客人吸引住了，这是因为他的故事和他本人高贵优雅的风度而导致的。我唯愿自己能安慰他，可是，对于这样一个无限痛苦、毫无可资慰藉的希望的人来说，难道我的劝说能使他活下去吗？啊，不可能！他现在所知道的唯一欢乐是，使自己那被摧垮的精神恢复平静，走向宁静和死亡。不过他还能享受到一种安慰，那是他在孤独和狂想中的产物，他相信在梦中能够和亲人们会聚，从中得到慰藉以抚慰他的痛苦和复仇的激情，他认为梦中的亲人们并非幻想的产物，而是他们亲自从一个遥远而缥缈的世界来探望他来了。这种信念使他的狂想带上了一种庄严的色彩，令我也感到像真有其事一样的确凿和有趣。

我们的交谈并不总是局限于他的故事和不幸遭遇。在一般学识的每一个问题上，他都表现出渊博的知识和敏捷而深刻的领悟力。他的口才既有极强的说服力，又有很深的感染力。当他讲到某个凄惨的事件，或者想要激起怜悯和爱心的时候，我总是禁不住边听边掉眼泪。在濒临毁灭之际他尚且如此高贵脱俗，那么他在风华正茂的时候又应该是怎样一个富于丰采的人物啊！他似乎也感觉到了自己的价值和自己毁灭的不同凡响。

“在我年轻的时候，”他说，“我相信自己命中注定要从事某种伟大的事业。我有丰富的情感，然而我又具有足以使自己取得杰出成就的那种冷静的判断力。正是这种对自己天性富于价值的意识在支撑着我，要是其他人早就被压垮了。因为我认为，如果把有益于我的同类的这些才能虚掷在无用的忧伤上面，那是一种犯罪。当我想到自己完成的那个创造物，绝不逊色于一个有知觉有理性的生物的时候，我就不能将自己归属在平庸的研究者之列。不过，这种想法虽然在我事业开始的时候曾经支持过我，现在却只能使我惭愧得无地自容了。我的一切思考和希望都分文不值。我就像那个渴求万能的大天使，被囚禁在永恒的地狱里。我的想象力非常活跃，而我的分析力和实际操作能力也极强。由于我综合了这些品质，便产生了创造人的念头并付诸实施。甚至现在，我回忆起工作尚未完成时自己所怀抱的幻想，还不能不充满激情。我的思想仿佛进入了天堂，时而因我的才能欣喜若狂，时而因我的异常效力热情高涨。我从童年时期就充满了崇高的希望和远大的抱负，可是如今我是多么的沮丧啊！啊！我的朋友，假如你认识过去的我，你会认不出现在萎靡蜕化了的我来。过去我的心情很少颓丧失望，似乎有一种崇高的命运在推动着我，直到我倒下为止，并且永远、永远也站不起来了。”

难道我一定得失去这个可崇敬的人吗？我一直渴望得到一个朋友，我一直在寻找一个可以同情和爱我的人。看，在这片荒凉的大海上，我终于发现了这样一个人，然而我担心自己得到了他，却只是为了在了解他的价值之后又失去他。我劝告他应该活下去，但他拒绝接受这种看法。

“谢谢你，沃尔顿，”他说，“谢谢你对如此不幸的可怜人给予的好意，可是你谈到人间新的纽带和新的感情的时候，你想过没有，它们难道能代替失去的东西吗？对于我来说，有哪个男子比得上克莱瓦尔，有哪个女子比得上伊丽莎白？就算我们的感情不是被超凡的卓越品德所激励，那童年时代的相依相伴也对我们的心灵发挥着作用，而后来结交的朋友是不可能如此的。他们了解我们幼年的癖性，这些癖性不管后来受到怎样的影响，却是永远不可磨灭的，他们对于我们整个的动机有确切的了解，也更能准确判断我们的行为。姐妹和兄弟绝不会怀疑彼此在作伪欺诈，除非在早期就确实表现出这一类征兆，而别的朋友，无论彼此间是多么亲近，也有可能不由自主地心生猜疑。而我有过不仅就习惯和关系而言，而且从其自身美德而言都堪称珍贵的朋友，无论我在哪里，伊丽莎白抚慰的话语和克莱瓦尔的言谈都始终萦绕在我耳边。他们都死了，现在只有唯一的一种感情能在孤寂中支持我去延续自己的生命：假如我从事的是某种崇高的事业或计划，能给人类带来巨大的效用，那么我还能活下去并完成它。可是我的命运并不是这样，我不得不去追寻和毁灭自己创造出的那个生物，然后我在世间的使命才算完成，我才可以辞别人世。”

17××年8月26日

我亲爱的姐姐——我现在是在危险包围之中给你写信，而且我不知道自己是否能再见到亲爱的英格兰和在祖国的亲爱的朋友们。我们被重重冰山围困着，它们让我们无法逃匿，而且每分每秒都可能把我们的船压得粉碎。经我说服而成为我的伙伴的那些勇敢的船员们，都盼望着我能帮助他们，可是我一筹莫展。我们的处境足以令人魂飞魄散，然而勇气和希望仍然没有抛弃我。不过，一想到因为我而使这许多人的生命遭遇危险，的确是很可怕的。假如我们罹难了，那么我的疯狂计划便是这一切的根源。

玛格丽特，你又将是怎样的心情呢？你不会听到我们毁灭的消息，你会焦急地等待着我的归来。一年又一年过去了，很多时候你会感到绝望，然而又受到希望的折磨。啊！我亲爱的姐姐，你热切的盼望将变为伤心失望，我想到这一点，就感到比我自己的死亡还更加可怕。不过你有丈夫和可爱的孩子，你会幸福的，上帝保佑你并将赐给你幸福！

我那不幸的客人以最亲切的同情来对待我。他极力要让我心中充满希望，他谈起话来就仿佛对生命是非常珍惜似的。他提醒我说，其他试图在这一海域探险的航海家也曾遇到过类似的情况，他使我心中不由自主地充满吉祥的预兆。甚至水手们也感受到了他那雄辩的威力，只要他一讲话，大家就不再绝望了，他激发起了他们的力量，而且当他们听见他的声音时，便觉得那些巨大的冰山都只不过是些鼹鼠丘，在人的决心面前全都会化为乌有的。不过这些感觉只是短暂的，希望的实现每一天延误都使他们更加害怕，我几乎开始担忧这种绝望情绪可能会导致水手们的哗变。

9月2日

刚才发生了不同寻常的一幕，尽管这些记录很可能永远到不了你的手中，但我仍然禁不住要把它记下来。

我们仍被重重冰山包围着，仍处在随时可能被冰山的冲撞压碎的极度危险中。严寒让人不堪忍受，我的许多不幸的伙伴已经在这一派荒凉的境地里找到了他们的归宿。弗兰肯斯坦的健康日益恶化，他的眼中虽然还闪耀着狂热的火光，但他的元气已经枯竭了，即使有时突然振作一下，随后也仍旧陷入死气沉沉的状态。

我在上一封信中曾提到我担忧会发生水手哗变。就在今天早晨，当我坐在那儿望着我的朋友那苍白的面容时——他半闭着眼睛，四肢无力地下垂——五六个水手惊扰了我，他们要求进入我的船舱。他们进来后，由带头的人向我讲话。他告诉我，他和同伴们是被其他水手们推选出来的，代表大家来见我，向我提出一个就公正原则而言我不可拒绝的要求。我们现在被冰层困住了，也许根本无法逃脱，不过他们担心的是，冰海也可能会融化，船又可以自由通航，那么我会鲁莽地继续我的航程，使他们在本可以幸运地摆脱危险的情况下再陷入新的危险。因此，他们坚持要我许下庄严的诺言，船一旦可以航行，就必须立即掉头向南。

这一番话使我深感苦恼。我并没有绝望，我也从没有产生过解冻以后返航的念头。然而就公正性而言，甚至就可能性而言，我能够拒绝这个要求吗？我在做出答复之前踌躇不定，这时，起初一直保持沉默，而且似乎根本无力留意我们谈话的弗兰肯斯坦却惊醒了，他的眼睛闪烁着火花，双颊因一时激起的活力而泛着红晕。他转向水手们说：“你们这是什么意思？你们要求队长做什么？难道你们就这样轻易放弃自己的计划吗？难道你们没把这称为光荣的探险吗？它的光荣何在呢？并不在于这里的航道如南方的海洋那样顺畅平静，而在于它充满了危险和恐惧；在于每一个新的意外事件都要求你们坚韧不拔，显示自己的勇气；在于处处关系生死存亡，需要你们勇往直前，克服困难。正因为如此才叫作光荣，正因为如此才叫作荣誉的事业。你们日后将作为人类的恩人而接受欢呼，你们的名字将会像拼死争取荣誉和人类利益的勇敢者那样备受崇敬。而现在呢，看看吧，才刚刚想象到有危险，或者你们愿意这样说的话，才刚刚遭遇到对你们勇气的巨大而可怕的考验，你们就畏缩了，甘愿被后人视为无力承受寒冷和危险的人，要是这样的话，可怜的人们，就打着寒战缩回到温暖的火炉边去吧。何必当初要做这种准备呢？你们真不必跑这么远，拖着你们的队长来蒙受失败的耻辱，仅仅是为了证明你们自己是些胆小鬼。啊！不要胆怯，还要更加勇敢，要坚韧不拔地追求你们的目标，要像磐石般的坚定。冰山和你们的心并不是用同一种材料做成的，冰山是会移动的，只要你们说它不能阻挡你们，它就阻挡不了你们。不要在额头上带着耻辱的烙印回去见你们的家人，要像奋战和胜利了的英雄，像面对敌人绝不逃避的勇士那样载誉凯旋。”

在他说这番话的时候，语调随着言辞所表达的不同感情而抑扬顿挫，眼光里洋溢着崇高的思想和英雄精神，因而使得那些人深受感动，难道你会觉得这奇怪吗？他们面面相觑，无言以对。我说话了，我让他们回去想一想刚才听见的这番话，假如他们仍然坚持相反的意见，我将不会带他们再往北航行，但我希望他们经过考虑之后会恢复勇气。

他们退下了，我转身去看我的朋友，可是他已经精疲力竭，几乎耗尽了生命力。

我不知道这一切将怎样终结，但我宁可死去也不愿可耻地返航——我的目的还没有达到。不过我担心自己的命运已注定如此了，那些水手并无荣誉或自尊观念来支持自己，绝对做不到心甘情愿地继续忍受目前的苦难。

9月5日

情势已无可改变了，我业已同意，假如我们不死就返航。就这样，我的希望被怯懦和犹疑断送了，我一无所获、饱受挫折地回去了。要忍耐命运的如此不公，我真必须具有更多的乐天知命的哲人精神才行。

9月7日

一切都过去了，我正返航回英格兰。我想有益于人类和赢得光荣的希望破灭了，我也失去了我的朋友。可是我将尽力把那些惨痛情景详细地告诉你，我亲爱的姐姐，而且我正在漂向英格兰和你，我不应该感到沮丧。

9月9日，冰块开始移动了，当冰岛向四面八方分崩离析的时候，远远地就能听见雷鸣般的轰隆声。我们处于迫在眉睫的危险境况中。不过，既然我们对此完全无能为力，我的主要注意力便集中在我那不幸的朋友身上，当时他的病情已经恶化到躺在床上不能动弹的地步。冰层在我们背后断裂了，并被猛力推向北方。西边刮起了一股微风，到了11日，往南的航道完全畅通了。当水手们看见这种情况，感到他们返回祖国显然已确保无虞的时候，不禁高声地、长时间地发出了欣喜若狂的欢呼。正在昏睡的弗兰肯斯坦被惊醒了，询问这阵喧哗的原因。“他们在欢呼，”我说，“因为他们很快就将返回英格兰了。”

“那么你真的要返航啦？”

“唉！是啊，我无法对抗他们的要求。我不能强求他们跟我去冒险，我不得不返航。”

“如果你愿意，就回去好了，可是我不回去。你可以放弃你的目标，可是我的目标是上天分派给我的，我不敢放弃。我很衰弱，但助我复仇的精灵们肯定会给我足够的力量。”他一边这样说，一边竭力想从床上爬起来，可是力不从心，又倒回床上昏了过去。

过了很长时间他才苏醒过来，其间我常常以为他的生命已经完结了。他终于睁开了眼睛，艰难地呼吸着，说不出话来。医生给他服了镇静剂，吩咐我们不要惊扰他。他同时也告诉我说，我的朋友肯定活不了几个钟头了。

他必死无疑了，我只能满怀悲痛地耐心等待着他生命的终结。我坐在他的床头守候着。他紧闭着眼睛，我想他是睡着了。可是他很快又用微弱的声音叫我，要我靠近他，然后说：“唉！我赖以生存的力量已经耗尽了，我觉得自己快死了，而他，我的仇敌和迫害者，或许还活着。沃尔顿，你别以为我在生命的最后时刻还像过去那样，燃烧着仇恨之火，怀着强烈的复仇欲望，可是我仍然认为有理由要我的敌人死。在这最后的时日里，我一直在反省过去的所作所为，我并没有发现有什么可责备的。我在一种疯狂的热情中创造了一个有理性的生物，我当然有义务尽自己的力量保证他快乐和幸福。这是我的责任，可是我还有一个更为重大的责任。我更应该关注我对自己的同类所应负的义务，因为这涉及更多的人的幸福或痛苦。在这种看法的推动下，我才拒绝为第一个创造物造一个伴侣，我的拒绝是正确的。他行为邪恶，表现出了无与伦比的狠毒与自私，他杀害了我的亲人，他专门毁灭具有优美感情、享有幸福和智慧卓越的人，我简直不知道他的复仇欲望到哪里才是尽头。他自己是不幸的，但他必须死去才不会再酿成其他人的不幸。消灭他的任务应该由我来完成，可是我失败了。我曾出于自私和错误的动机要求你担当起我未完成的工作，现在我仅仅是出于理智和善的目的再次向你提出请求。

“不过，我不能要求你为完成这个任务而抛弃你的祖国和亲友。既然你现在就要回英格兰去，也就很少有机会遇见他了。至于你如何考虑这些问题，如何权衡你自己的责任，我留待你自己去决定好了。我的判断力和思考力已被正在逼近的死亡扰乱了。我不敢要求你去做我自以为正确的事，因为我仍可能被狂热误引上了歧途。

“令我心里不安的是，他还会活着继续作恶。要不是考虑到这一点，此刻，当我随时都在期望解脱的时候，应该是我好几年来唯一享受到幸福的时刻。亲爱的死者的形影正在我眼前游动，我要赶快投入他们的怀抱。永别了，沃尔顿，要追求宁静中的幸福，而不要野心勃勃，即使看来是出于纯洁的动机，只不过是想在科学发现上出人头地。可是我为什么要这样说呢？我本人的这些愿望应当受到指责，但换一个人也许就会成功。”

他越说声音越微弱，终于，他的力气枯竭了，陷入了沉默。大约半个钟头后，他又再次想说话，但已经办不到了。他无力地握了握我的手，永远地闭上了眼睛，一丝柔和微笑的光辉从他的唇边消逝了。

玛格丽特，对于这个光辉的心灵过早的泯灭，我能说什么呢？我又能说什么才能使你了解我的悲痛是何等深重呢？无论我说什么，都将是不贴切的、软弱无力的。我的泪水在涌流，我的心灵被失望的乌云所笼罩。不过，我正在返回英格兰，我或许能在那里找到安慰。

我的沉思突然被打断了。这些声响预示着什么？现在正是午夜，微风在轻轻吹拂，甲板上的守卫也没有任何动静。又响了一声，似乎是人的说话声，只不过更嘶哑，是从停放弗兰肯斯坦遗体的那间船舱里传出来的。我必须起身去查看。晚安，我的姐姐。

上帝啊！刚刚发生了怎样的情景！我一想起那一幕还不免头晕目眩。我不知道自己还有没有能力做详细的记叙，可是不写下这最后的、不可思议的悲惨结局，我记叙的故事就会是不完整的。

我走进了停放我那命运坎坷、令人崇敬的朋友弗兰肯斯坦的舱房。在他的遗体旁边立着一个我无法以语言来形容的形体：躯体庞大，但又模样粗野、身材畸形。他伫立在棺材前，脸面被蓬乱的长发遮住了，一只大手伸了出去，手的颜色和表面肌肤就像木乃伊一样。当他听见了我的脚步声，便停止了哀伤和恐惧的喊叫，向窗子那边跳了过去。我从来没有见过如此可怕的脸，竟如此的可憎和丑陋。我不由自主地闭上了眼睛，努力提醒自己面对这个杀人凶手应该尽到什么责任。我叫他站住。

他停住了，很诧异地望着我，接着，又转身朝他的创造者那毫无生气的身体走去。他似乎忘记了有我在场，整个表情和姿态好像都被无法抑制的狂怒所控制。

“这也是死在我手下的一个牺牲者！”他喊叫着，“杀了他，我的罪行就算圆满完成了。我生命的一连串不幸也就算结束了！啊，弗兰肯斯坦！胸怀宽广和自我献身的人啊！现在我求你宽恕又有什么用呢？我，毁灭了你所爱的一切，从而也无可挽回地毁灭了你。唉！他浑身冰凉，无法回答我了。”

他的声音哽咽了，我最初的冲动提醒我要遵照朋友的临终嘱托，杀死他的仇敌，现在却因为混杂在一起的好奇心和同情心而暂时缓和下来了。我向这个庞然大物逼近，但我不敢抬起眼来看一看，因为他那丑陋的形象是如此吓人和怪异。我企图讲话，可是话到嘴边就消失得无影无踪。怪物继续倾诉着狂野而语无伦次的自我谴责。在他暴风雨般的狂热稍微停息的时候，我终于下定决心对他讲话。“你的悔悟现在无济于事了，”我说，“假如在你恶魔般的报复心还没有发展到极度以前，你能倾听良心的声音，感受到内疚的刺痛，弗兰肯斯坦也许现在还活着。”

“你在做梦吗？”魔鬼说，“你以为我对痛苦和悔恨毫无所感吗——他，”他指着尸体继续说，“他在生命终结的时候并没有受苦——啊！就算他痛苦，但和我苦苦挨过的漫长痛楚相比还不到万分之一。一种可怕的自私心驱策着我，但我的心同时又在受到悔恨的吞噬。难道你认为克莱瓦尔的呻吟在我听来竟会是美妙的音乐？我的心生来就对爱和同情很敏感，而苦难却把它扭曲为邪恶和仇恨，在这种剧烈变化的过程中它受尽了折磨，那是你不可能想象到的。

“在杀死了克莱瓦尔以后，我悲痛欲绝地返回了瑞士。我可怜弗兰肯斯坦，我的怜悯渐渐发展成为憎恶，我憎恶我自己。可是，我发现他，我生命的创造者，同时又是我无法形容的痛苦的制造者，竟想获得幸福。他一面在不断给我制造不幸和绝望，自己却企图享受我永远被禁止获取的种种美好感情。这时候，无可奈何的嫉妒和狠毒的愤怒便充溢了我的心，唤起了我难以满足的复仇欲望。我想起了对他的恐吓，决心将它付诸实行。我明白，这也是在给自己准备致命的折磨。可是我已成了这种冲动的奴隶而不是主人，我尽管厌恶它，却又无力反抗它。然而，当她死的时候！——不，我当时并不感到痛苦。我已经割舍了一切感情，抑制了一切痛苦，在极度绝望当中肆意放纵了。在我眼里，恶从此以后变成了善。我被驱赶着走了这么远，我已经别无选择，只有使自己的本性去适应那种并非我自愿选择的原则了。完成我那恶魔似的计划，这已成为我无法餍足的欲望。现在终于结束了，这就是我手下最后一个牺牲者！”

我一开始被他对自己苦难的描述所打动，不过，我想起了弗兰肯斯坦说过他富于雄辩和说服的力量，而且我的目光又再次投向我的朋友那丧失生命的躯体，禁不住心里燃起了怒火。“卑鄙的家伙！”我说道，“你跑到这儿来对着你制造的惨状哭哭啼啼，倒是挺不错啊。你在一片房屋里放上一把火，等它们烧光了，就坐在废墟上对火灾表示悲痛。伪善的魔鬼！假如你所哀悼的人还活着的话，仍然会成为你该死的复仇欲的目标，受到你的摧残。你的感情并不是怜悯，你伤心的只是你残杀的牺牲者已经不由你控制了。”

“啊，并不是这样——不是这样，”他打断了我的话，“不过你从表面来看我的行为动机，也难免会有这样的印象。可是我并不寻求人对我的苦难的同情。我永远也找不到这种同情。当我刚开初寻求它时，是因为我的内心充满着对美德的爱、对幸福的向往和对感情的需求，我希望能有人和我分享。而现在对我来说，美德只是一个幻影，幸福和感情也变成了痛楚和厌弃一切的绝望，我能在哪里去找同情呢？只要我的苦难还存在，我宁愿独自去承受，在我死去的时候，如果我的记忆里装满了憎恶和轻蔑，我将心满意足。一度，我的幻想曾在关于美德、名誉和欢乐的梦想中获得安慰。一度，我曾抱着虚幻的希望，相信会遇见那样的人，他们将不在意我的外表，而会因我所能展示的优秀品德而爱我。我曾怀抱着关于荣誉和献身的崇高思想。可是现在，罪恶已经使我堕落到连最卑贱的动物也不如的地步了。找不到任何罪过，任何危害，任何邪恶，任何苦难，能和我的所作所为相比拟。当我历历回顾自己犯下的所有罪孽的时候，我不敢相信我竟是过去那同一个我，心中曾经充满了对于美与善的崇高而超凡的憧憬。然而事实就是如此，堕落的天使变成了狠毒的魔鬼。即使是上帝和人类的那个敌人(1)，在他凄惨的处境中也还有朋友和伙伴，我却是孤零零的。

“你，既然称弗兰肯斯坦为朋友，看来也知道我的罪行和他的不幸了。可是他告诉你的无论多么详尽，也无法概括我所经受的日复一日、月复一月的痛苦，时光就在无可奈何的愤怒中耗尽了。因为我即使毁灭了他的希望，却并没有满足自己的欲望。我的欲望永远是那么热烈和迫切，我仍然渴望着爱和友谊，然而我仍然遭人唾弃。这里面难道没有不公平的地方吗？全人类对我犯了罪，难道唯有我应该被看作罪犯吗？为什么你不憎恨那个把自己的朋友无礼地赶出家门的费利克斯？为什么你不憎恶那个想杀死他孩子的救命恩人的乡下人？是呀，这些人都是道德高尚、毫无瑕疵的人！我，这悲惨的和被遗弃的生命，是个畸形儿，活该受唾弃、受欺辱、受践踏。甚至是现在，我一想起这种不公平，血液就会沸腾起来。

“可是说老实话，我确实是个卑鄙的家伙。我杀害过可爱的、孤弱无援的人，我掐死过熟睡中的无辜者，扼死过从未伤害过我或其他任何生灵的人。我一心要给我的创造者制造苦难，而他却是一切人当中最值得爱的佼佼者，我甚至执意要逼迫得他走向无可挽回的毁灭。他就躺在那儿，惨白地冰凉地死了。你恨我，可是你对我的憎恶比不上我对自己的憎恶。我看着干下这种行为的双手，我想到孕育了这些恶念的心，我真渴望那个时刻，我的双手将蒙住我的眼睛，恶念也不再纠缠我的思想。

“不要害怕我将来还会为非作歹。我的事情差不多做完了。我的生命已经终结，必须做的也都已完成，并不需要你或其他任何人再去死，现在需要的只是我自己的死亡。别以为我会慢悠悠地实施我的生命的献祭。我将离开你们的船，登上带我来的那个冰筏，找到地球的最北端，我将聚起自己葬身的火堆，把这可怜的躯体烧成灰烬，不让残骸给任何好奇而邪恶的坏蛋提供线索，再造出一个像我这样的怪物。我将死去。我将不再感受到现今折磨着我的痛苦，也不再忍受那些无可满足、却又无法泯灭的感情的吞噬。给我生命的人已经死去，当我也不复存在的时候，对我们两个的记忆也将很快地消泯。我将再也见不到太阳和星星，也感受不到风吹拂我的脸颊了。光明、感情和知觉都将消失，在这种状态下我一定能找到自己的欢乐。若干年前，当这个世界的景象第一次展现在我眼前的时候，当我感受到夏日令人欢欣的温暖，听见树叶沙沙作响和鸟儿的婉转鸣唱的时候，它们就是我的一切，那时假如死去我是会哭泣的，现在死亡却是我唯一的安慰了。我被罪孽所玷污，被痛楚的悔恨所撕裂，除了死亡以外我还能在哪里求得安宁呢？

“永别了！我将离开你，你将是我这双眼睛所见到的人类中的最后的一个。永别了，弗兰肯斯坦！假如你还活着，还怀着向我复仇的欲望的话，我活着要比死去更能满足你。可是事实上不是这样，你一直要想毁灭我，以免导致更大的不幸。然而，假如你以某种我不知道的方式还仍然保持着思考和感觉的话，你将宁愿让我处在目前的状况中，因为再没有比这更厉害的报复方法了。尽管你遭到了摧残，可我的痛苦远远胜过了你，因为悔恨之痛的尖刺将永远拨弄着我的伤口，直至死亡使它永远愈合为止。

“不过快了，”他满怀惨伤而庄严的热情高喊道，“我就要死了，我现在所感受的一切都将不再感受到了。痛苦的火焰快熄灭了。我将意气昂扬地登上火葬的柴堆，在烈焰烧灼的痛楚中狂喜欢悦。火焰的光辉会渐渐黯淡，我的灰烬将被风刮进大海。我的灵魂将永远安息，假如它还会思想的话，它肯定不会像现在这样想了。永别了。”

他一面说着，一面从船舱的窗口跳了出去，落到了紧靠船边的冰筏上。他很快就被波涛带走了，消失在黑暗的远方。

Preface


The event on which this fiction is founded has been supposed，by Dr．Darwin and some of the physiological writers of Germany，as not of impossible occurrence．I shall not be supposed as according the remotest degree of serious faith to such an imagination； yet，in assuming it as the basis of a work of fancy，I have not considered myself as merely weaving a series of supernatural terrors．The event on which the interest of the story depends is exempt from the disadvantages of a mere tale of spectres or enchantment．It was recommended by the novelty of the situations which it develops，and however impossible as a physical fact，affords a point of view to the imagination for the delineating of human passions more comprehensive and commanding than any which the ordinary relations of existing events can yield．

I have thus endeavoured to preserve the truth of the elementary principles of human nature，while I have not scrupled to innovate upon their combinations．The Iliad，the tragic poetry of Greece，Shakespeare in the Tempest and Midsummer Night's Dream，and most especially Milton in Paradise Lost conform to this rule； and the most humble novelist，who seeks to confer or receive amusement from his labours，may，without presumption，apply to prose fiction a license，or rather a rule，from the adoption of which so many exquisite combinations of human feeling have resulted in the highest specimens of poetry．

The circumstance on which my story rests was suggested in casual conversation．It was commenced partly as a source of amusement，and partly as an expedient for exercising any untried resources of mind．Other motives were mingled with these as the work proceeded．I am by no means indifferent to the manner in which whatever moral tendencies exist in the sentiments or characters it contains shall affect the reader； yet my chief concern in this respect has been limited to avoiding the enervating effects of the novels of the present day，and to the exhibition of the amiableness of domestic affection，and the excellence of universal virtue．The opinions which naturally spring from the character and situation of the hero are by no means to be conceived as existing always in my own conviction； nor is any inference justly to be drawn from the following pages as prejudicing any philosophical doctrine of whatever kind．

It is a subject also of additional interest to the author that this story was begun in the majestic region where the scene is principally laid and in society which cannot cease to be regretted．I passed the summer of 1816 in the environs of Geneva．The season was cold and rainy，and in the evenings we crowded around a blazing wood fire and occasionally amused ourselves with some German stories of ghosts which happened to fall into our hands．These tales excited in us a playful desire of imitation．Two other friends（a tale from the pen of one of whom would be far more acceptable to the public than anything I can ever hope to produce）and myself agreed to write each a story founded on some supernatural occurrence．

The weather，however，suddenly became serene； and my two friends left me on a journey among the Alps and lost，in the magnificent scenes which they present，all memory of their ghostly visions．The following tale is the only one which has been completed．

Marlow，September，1817





Letter 1

To Mrs．Saville，England


St．Petersburgh，Dec．11th，17—

You will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil forebodings．I arrived here yesterday，and my first task is to assure my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success of my undertaking．

I am already far north of London，and as I walk in the streets of Petersburgh，I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks，which braces my nerves and fills me with delight．Do you understand this feeling？This breeze，which has travelled from the regions towards which I am advancing，gives me a foretaste of those icy climes．Inspirited by this wind of promise，my daydreams become more fervent and vivid．I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost and desolation； it ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty and delight．There，Margaret，the sun is forever visible，its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a perpetual splendour．There—for with your leave，my sister，I will put some trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are banished； and，sailing over a calm sea，we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable globe．Its productions and features may be without example，as the phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered solitudes．What may not be expected in a country of eternal light？I may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent forever．I shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world never before visited，and may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of man．These are my enticements，and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little boat，with his holiday mates，on an expedition of discovery up his native river．But supposing all these conjectures to be false，you cannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all mankind，to the last generation，by discovering a passage near the pole to those countries，to reach which at present so many months are requisite； or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet，which，if at all possible，can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine．

These reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my letter，and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me to heaven，for nothing contributes so much to tranquillize the mind as a steady purpose—a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye．This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years．I have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have been made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean through the seas which surround the pole．You may remember that a history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the whole of our good Uncle Thomas' library．My education was neglected，yet I was passionately fond of reading．These volumes were my study day and night，and my familiarity with them increased that regret which I had felt，as a child，on learning that my father's dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life．

These visions faded when I perused，for the first time，those poets whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven．I also became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation； I imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the names of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated．You are well acquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the disappointment．But just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin，and my thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent．

Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking．I can，even now，remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this great enterprise．I commenced by inuring my body to hardship．I accompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea； I voluntarily endured cold，famine，thirst，and want of sleep； I often worked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my nights to the study of mathematics，the theory of medicine，and those branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive the greatest practical advantage．Twice I actually hired myself as an under-mate in a Greenland whaler，and acquitted myself to admiration．I must own I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second dignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest earnestness，so valuable did he consider my services．

And now，dear Margaret，do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose？My life might have been passed in ease and luxury，but I preferred glory to every enticement that wealth placed in my path．Oh，that some encouraging voice would answer in the affirmative！My courage and my resolution is firm； but my hopes fluctuate，and my spirits are often depressed．I am about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage，the emergencies of which will demand all my fortitude：I am required not only to raise the spirits of others，but sometimes to sustain my own，when theirs are failing．

This is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia．They fly quickly over the snow in their sledges； the motion is pleasant，and，in my opinion，far more agreeable than that of an English stagecoach．The cold is not excessive，if you are wrapped in furs—a dress which I have already adopted，for there is a great difference between walking the deck and remaining seated motionless for hours，when no exercise prevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins．I have no ambition to lose my life on the post-road between St．Petersburgh and Archangel．

I shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks； and my intention is to hire a ship there，which can easily be done by paying the insurance for the owner，and to engage as many sailors as I think necessary among those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing．I do not intend to sail until the month of June； and when shall I return？Ah，dear sister，how can I answer this question？If I succeed，many，many months，perhaps years，will pass before you and I may meet．If I fail，you will see me again soon，or never．

Farewell，my dear，excellent Margaret．Heaven shower down blessings on you，and save me，that I may again and again testify my gratitude for all your love and kindness．

Your affectionate brother，

R．Walton





Letter 2

To Mrs．Saville，England


Archangel，28th March，17—

How slowly the time passes here，encompassed as I am by frost and snow！Yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise．I have hired a vessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors； those whom I have already engaged appear to be men on whom I can depend and are certainly possessed of dauntless courage．

But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy，and the absence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil．I have no friend，Margaret：when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success，there will be none to participate my joy； if I am assailed by disappointment，no one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection．I shall commit my thoughts to paper，it is true； but that is a poor medium for the communication of feeling．I desire the company of a man who could sympathize with me，whose eyes would reply to mine．You may deem me romantic，my dear sister，but I bitterly feel the want of a friend．I have no one near me，gentle yet courageous，possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind，whose tastes are like my own，to approve or amend my plans．How would such a friend repair the faults of your poor brother！I am too ardent in execution and too impatient of difficulties．But it is a still greater evil to me that I am self-educated：for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild on a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomas' books of voyages．At that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own country； but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its most important benefits from such a conviction that I perceived the necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native country．Now I am twenty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than many schoolboys of fifteen．It is true that I have thought more and that my daydreams are more extended and magnificent，but they want（as the painters call it）keeping； and I greatly need a friend who would have sense enough not to despise me as romantic，and affection enough for me to endeavour to regulate my mind．

Well，these are useless complaints；I shall certainly find no friend on the wide ocean，nor even here in Archangel，among merchants and seamen．Yet some feelings，unallied to the dross of human nature，beat even in these rugged bosoms．My lieutenant，for instance，is a man of wonderful courage and enterprise；he is madly desirous of glory，or rather，to word my phrase more characteristically，of advancement in his profession．He is an Englishman，and in the midst of national and professional prejudices，unsoftened by cultivation，retains some of the noblest endowments of humanity．I first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel；finding that he was unemployed in this city，I easily engaged him to assist in my enterprise．

The master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the ship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline．This circumstance，added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage，made me very desirous to engage him．A youth passed in solitude，my best years spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage，has so refined the groundwork of my character that I cannot overcome an intense distaste to the usual brutality exercised on board ship：I have never believed it to be necessary，and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew，I felt myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services．I heard of him first in rather a romantic manner，from a lady who owes to him the happiness of her life．This，briefly，is his story．Some years ago he loved a young Russian lady of moderate fortune，and having amassed a considerable sum in prize-money，the father of the girl consented to the match．He saw his mistress once before the destined ceremony；but she was bathed in tears，and throwing herself at his feet，entreated him to spare her，confessing at the same time that she loved another，but that he was poor，and that her father would never consent to the union．My generous friend reassured the suppliant，and on being informed of the name of her lover，instantly abandoned his pursuit．He had already bought a farm with his money，on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life；but he bestowed the whole on his rival，together with the remains of his prize-money to purchase stock，and then himself solicited the young woman's father to consent to her marriage with her lover．But the old man decidedly refused，thinking himself bound in honour to my friend，who，when he found the father inexorable，quitted his country，nor returned until he heard that his former mistress was married according to her inclinations．“What a noble fellow！”you will exclaim．He is so；but then he is wholly uneducated：he is as silent as a Turk，and a kind of ignorant carelessness attends him，which，while it renders his conduct the more astonishing，detracts from the interest and sympathy which otherwise he would command．

Yet do not suppose，because I complain a little or because I can conceive a consolation for my toils which I may never know，that I am wavering in my resolutions．Those are as fixed as fate，and my voyage is only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation．The winter has been dreadfully severe，but the spring promises well，and it is considered as a remarkably early season，so that perhaps I may sail sooner than I expected．I shall do nothing rashly：you know me sufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the safety of others is committed to my care．

I cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my undertaking．It is impossible to communicate to you a conception of the trembling sensation，half pleasurable and half fearful，with which I am preparing to depart．I am going to unexplored regions，to“the land of mist and snow，”but I shall kill no albatross；therefore do not be alarmed for my safety or if I should come back to you as worn and woeful as the“Ancient Mariner．”You will smile at my allusion，but I will disclose a secret．I have often attributed my attachment to，my passionate enthusiasm for，the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that production of the most imaginative of modern poets．There is something at work in my soul which I do not understand．I am practically industrious—painstaking，a workman to execute with perseverance and labour—but besides this there is a love for the marvellous，a belief in the marvellous，intertwined in all my projects，which hurries me out of the common pathways of men，even to the wild sea and unvisited regions I am about to explore．

But to return to dearer considerations．Shall I meet you again，after having traversed immense seas，and returned by the most southern cape of Africa or America？I dare not expect such success，yet I cannot bear to look on the reverse of the picture．Continue for the present to write to me by every opportunity：I may receive your letters on some occasions when I need them most to support my spirits．I love you very tenderly．Remember me with affection，should you never hear from me again．

Your affectionate brother，

Robert Walton

July 7th，17—

My dear Sister，

I write a few lines in haste to say that I am safe—and well advanced on my voyage．This letter will reach England by a merchantman now on its homeward voyage from Archangel；more fortunate than I，who may not see my native land，perhaps，for many years．I am，however，in good spirits：my men are bold and apparently firm of purpose，nor do the floating sheets of ice that continually pass us，indicating the dangers of the region towards which we are advancing，appear to dismay them．We have already reached a very high latitude；but it is the height of summer，and although not so warm as in England，the southern gales，which blow us speedily towards those shores which I so ardently desire to attain，breathe a degree of renovating warmth which I had not expected．

No incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a letter．One or two stiff gales and the springing of a leak are accidents which experienced navigators scarcely remember to record，and I shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us during our voyage．

Adieu，my dear Margaret．Be assured that for my own sake，as well as yours，I will not rashly encounter danger．I will be cool，persevering，and prudent．

But success shall crown my endeavours．Wherefore not？Thus far I have gone，tracing a secure way over the pathless seas，the very stars themselves being witnesses and testimonies of my triumph．Why not still proceed over the untamed yet obedient element？What can stop the determined heart and resolved will of man？

My swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus．But I must finish．Heaven bless my beloved sister！

R．W．





Letter 4

To Mrs．Saville，England


August 5th，17—

So strange an accident has happened to us that I cannot forbear recording it，although it is very probable that you will see me before these papers can come into your possession．

Last Monday（July 31st）we were nearly surrounded by ice，which closed in the ship on all sides，scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which she floated．Our situation was somewhat dangerous，especially as we were compassed round by a very thick fog．We accordingly lay to，hoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather．

About two o'clock the mist cleared away，and we beheld，stretched out in every direction，vast and irregular plains of ice，which seemed to have no end．Some of my comrades groaned，and my own mind began to grow watchful with anxious thoughts，when a strange sight suddenly attracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our own situation．We perceived a low carriage，fixed on a sledge and drawn by dogs，pass on towards the north，at the distance of half a mile；a being which had the shape of a man，but apparently of gigantic stature，sat in the sledge and guided the dogs．We watched the rapid progress of the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the distant inequalities of the ice．

This appearance excited our unqualified wonder．We were，as we believed，many hundred miles from any land；but this apparition seemed to denote that it was not，in reality，so distant as we had supposed．Shut in，however，by ice，it was impossible to follow his track，which we had observed with the greatest attention．

About two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea，and before night the ice broke and freed our ship．We，however，lay to until the morning，fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which float about after the breaking up of the ice．I profited of this time to rest for a few hours．

In the morning，however，as soon as it was light，I went upon deck and found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel，apparently talking to someone in the sea．It was，in fact，a sledge，like that we had seen before，which had drifted towards us in the night on a large fragment of ice．Only one dog remained alive；but there was a human being within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel．He was not，as the other traveller seemed to be，a savage inhabitant of some undiscovered island，but a European．When I appeared on deck the master said，“Here is our captain，and he will not allow you to perish on the open sea．”

On perceiving me，the stranger addressed me in English，although with a foreign accent．“Before I come on board your vessel，”said he，“will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound？”

You may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed to me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom I should have supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford．I replied，however，that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the northern pole．

Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board．Good God！Margaret，if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for his safety，your surprise would have been boundless．His limbs were nearly frozen，and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and suffering．I never saw a man in so wretched a condition．We attempted to carry him into the cabin，but as soon as he had quitted the fresh air he fainted．We accordingly brought him back to the deck and restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to swallow a small quantity．As soon as he showed signs of life we wrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the kitchen stove．By slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup，which restored him wonderfully．

Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak，and I often feared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding．When he had in some measure recovered，I removed him to my own cabin and attended on him as much as my duty would permit．I never saw a more interesting creature：his eyes have generally an expression of wildness，and even madness，but there are moments when，if anyone performs an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most trifling service，his whole countenance is lighted up，as it were，with a beam of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled．But he is generally melancholy and despairing，and sometimes he gnashes his teeth，as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him．

When my guest was a little recovered I had great trouble to keep off the men，who wished to ask him a thousand questions；but I would not allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity，in a state of body and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose．Once，however，the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice in so strange a vehicle．

His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom，and he replied，“To seek one who fled from me．”

“And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion？”

“Yes．”

“Then I fancy we have seen him，for the day before we picked you up we saw some dogs drawing a sledge，with a man in it，across the ice．”

This aroused the stranger's attention，and he asked a multitude of questions concerning the route which the demon，as he called him，had pursued．Soon after，when he was alone with me，he said，“I have，doubtless，excited your curiosity，as well as that of these good people；but you are too considerate to make inquiries．”

“Certainly；it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine．”

“And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation；you have benevolently restored me to life．”

Soon after this he inquired if I thought that the breaking up of the ice had destroyed the other sledge．I replied that I could not answer with any degree of certainty，for the ice had not broken until near midnight，and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety before that time；but of this I could not judge．

From this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the stranger．He manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for the sledge which had before appeared；but I have persuaded him to remain in the cabin，for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere．I have promised that someone should watch for him and give him instant notice if any new object should appear in sight．

Such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the present day．The stranger has gradually improved in health but is very silent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin．Yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all interested in him，although they have had very little communication with him．For my own part，I begin to love him as a brother，and his constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion．He must have been a noble creature in his better days，being even now in wreck so attractive and amiable．

I said in one of my letters，my dear Margaret，that I should find no friend on the wide ocean；yet I have found a man who，before his spirit had been broken by misery，I should have been happy to have possessed as the brother of my heart．

I shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals，should I have any fresh incidents to record．

August 13th，17—

My affection for my guest increases every day．He excites at once my admiration and my pity to an astonishing degree．How can I see so noble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant grief？He is so gentle，yet so wise；his mind is so cultivated，and when he speaks，although his words are culled with the choicest art，yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence．

He is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck，apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own．Yet，although unhappy，he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he interests himself deeply in the projects of others．He has frequently conversed with me on mine，which I have communicated to him without disguise．He entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my eventual success and into every minute detail of the measures I had taken to secure it．I was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the language of my heart，to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul and to say，with all the fervour that warmed me，how gladly I would sacrifice my fortune，my existence，my every hope，to the furtherance of my enterprise．One man's life or death were but a small price to pay for the acquirement of the knowledge which I sought，for the dominion I should acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race．As I spoke，a dark gloom spread over my listener's countenance．At first I perceived that he tried to suppress his emotion；he placed his hands before his eyes，and my voice quivered and failed me as I beheld tears trickle fast from between his fingers；a groan burst from his heaving breast．I paused；at length he spoke，in broken accents：“Unhappy man！Do you share my madness？Have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught？Hear me；let me reveal my tale，and you will dash the cup from your lips！”

Such words，you may imagine，strongly excited my curiosity；but the paroxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened powers，and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were necessary to restore his composure．

Having conquered the violence of his feelings，he appeared to despise himself for being the slave of passion；and quelling the dark tyranny of despair，he led me again to converse concerning myself personally．He asked me the history of my earlier years．The tale was quickly told，but it awakened various trains of reflection．I spoke of my desire of finding a friend，of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than had ever fallen to my lot，and expressed my conviction that a man could boast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing．

“I agree with you，”replied the stranger；“we are unfashioned creatures，but half made up，if one wiser，better，dearer than ourselves—such a friend ought to be—do not lend his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures．I once had a friend，the most noble of human creatures，and am entitled，therefore，to judge respecting friendship．You have hope，and the world before you，and have no cause for despair．But I—I have lost everything and cannot begin life anew．”

As he said this his countenance became expressive of a calm，settled grief that touched me to the heart．But he was silent and presently retired to his cabin．

Even broken in spirit as he is，no one can feel more deeply than he does the beauties of nature．The starry sky，the sea，and every sight afforded by these wonderful regions seem still to have the power of elevating his soul from earth．Such a man has a double existence：he may suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments，yet when he has retired into himself，he will be like a celestial spirit that has a halo around him，within whose circle no grief or folly ventures．

Will you smile at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine wanderer？You would not if you saw him．You have been tutored and refined by books and retirement from the world，and you are therefore somewhat fastidious；but this only renders you the more fit to appreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man．Sometimes I have endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses that elevates him so immeasurably above any other person I ever knew．I believe it to be an intuitive discernment，a quick but never-failing power of judgment，a penetration into the causes of things，unequalled for clearness and precision；add to this a facility of expression and a voice whose varied intonations are soul-subduing music．

August 19，17—

Yesterday the stranger said to me，“You may easily perceive，Captain Walton，that I have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes．I had determined at one time that the memory of these evils should die with me，but you have won me to alter my determination．You seek for knowledge and wisdom，as I once did；and I ardently hope that the gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you，as mine has been．I do not know that the relation of my disasters will be useful to you；yet，when I reflect that you are pursuing the same course，exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me what I am，I imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale，one that may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking and console you in case of failure．Prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually deemed marvellous．Were we among the tamer scenes of nature I might fear to encounter your unbelief，perhaps your ridicule；but many things will appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which would provoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever-varied powers of nature；nor can I doubt but that my tale conveys in its series internal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed．”

You may easily imagine that I was much gratified by the offered communication，yet I could not endure that he should renew his grief by a recital of his misfortunes．I felt the greatest eagerness to hear the promised narrative，partly from curiosity and partly from a strong desire to ameliorate his fate if it were in my power．I expressed these feelings in my answer．

“I thank you，”he replied，“for your sympathy，but it is useless；my fate is nearly fulfilled．I wait but for one event，and then I shall repose in peace．I understand your feeling，”continued he，perceiving that I wished to interrupt him；“but you are mistaken，my friend，if thus you will allow me to name you；nothing can alter my destiny；listen to my history，and you will perceive how irrevocably it is determined．”

He then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when I should be at leisure．This promise drew from me the warmest thanks．I have resolved every night，when I am not imperatively occupied by my duties，to record，as nearly as possible in his own words，what he has related during the day．If I should be engaged，I will at least make notes．This manuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure；but to me，who know him and who hear it from his own lips—with what interest and sympathy shall I read it in some future day！Even now，as I commence my task，his full-toned voice swells in my ears；his lustrous eyes dwell on me with all their melancholy sweetness；I see his thin hand raised in animation，while the lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul within．Strange and harrowing must be his story，frightful the storm which embraced the gallant vessel on its course and wrecked it—thus！





Chapter 1


I am by birth a Genevese，and my family is one of the most distinguished of that republic．My ancestors had been for many years counsellors and syndics，and my father had filled several public situations with honour and reputation．He was respected by all who knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public business．He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the affairs of his country；a variety of circumstances had prevented his marrying early，nor was it until the decline of life that he became a husband and the father of a family．

As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character，I cannot refrain from relating them．One of his most intimate friends was a merchant who，from a flourishing state，fell，through numerous mischances，into poverty．This man，whose name was Beaufort，was of a proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been distinguished for his rank and magnificence．Having paid his debts，therefore，in the most honourable manner，he retreated with his daughter to the town of Lucerne，where he lived unknown and in wretchedness．My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship and was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances．He bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct so little worthy of the affection that united them．He lost no time in endeavouring to seek him out，with the hope of persuading him to begin the world again through his credit and assistance．

Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself，and it was ten months before my father discovered his abode．Overjoyed at this discovery，he hastened to the house，which was situated in a mean street near the Reuss．But when he entered，misery and despair alone welcomed him．Beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes，but it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months，and in the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a merchant's house．The interval was，consequently，spent in inaction；his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for reflection，and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end of three months he lay on a bed of sickness，incapable of any exertion．

His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness，but she saw with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that there was no other prospect of support．But Caroline Beaufort possessed a mind of an uncommon mould，and her courage rose to support her in her adversity．She procured plain work；she plaited straw and by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to support life．

Several months passed in this manner．Her father grew worse；her time was more entirely occupied in attending him；her means of subsistence decreased；and in the tenth month her father died in her arms，leaving her an orphan and a beggar．This last blow overcame her，and she knelt by Beaufort's coffin weeping bitterly，when my father entered the chamber．He came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl，who committed herself to his care；and after the interment of his friend he conducted her to Geneva and placed her under the protection of a relation．Two years after this event Caroline became his wife．

There was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents，but this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted affection．There was a sense of justice in my father's upright mind which rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love strongly．Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set a greater value on tried worth．There was a show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to my mother，differing wholly from the doting fondness of age，for it was inspired by reverence for her virtues and a desire to be the means of，in some degree，recompensing her for the sorrows she had endured，but which gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour to her．Everything was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience．He strove to shelter her，as a fair exotic is sheltered by the gardener，from every rougher wind and to surround her with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and benevolent mind．Her health，and even the tranquillity of her hitherto constant spirit，had been shaken by what she had gone through．During the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had gradually relinquished all his public functions；and immediately after their union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy，and the change of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders，as a restorative for her weakened frame．

From Italy they visited Germany and France．I，their eldest child，was born at Naples，and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles．I remained for several years their only child．Much as they were attached to each other，they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very mine of love to bestow them upon me．My mother's tender caresses and my father's smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my first recollections．I was their plaything and their idol，and something better—their child，the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on them by heaven，whom to bring up to good，and whose future lot it was in their hands to direct to happiness or misery，according as they fulfilled their duties towards me．With this deep consciousness of what they owed towards the being to which they had given life，added to the active spirit of tenderness that animated both，it may be imagined that while during every hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience，of charity，and of self-control，I was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but one train of enjoyment to me．

For a long time I was their only care．My mother had much desired to have a daughter，but I continued their single offspring．When I was about five years old，while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy，they passed a week on the shores of the Lake of Como．Their benevolent disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor．This，to my mother，was more than a duty；it was a necessity，a passion—remembering what she had suffered，and how she had been relieved—for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the afflicted．During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale attracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate，while the number of half-clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst shape．One day，when my father had gone by himself to Milan，my mother，accompanied by me，visited this abode．She found a peasant and his wife，hard working，bent down by care and labour，distributing a scanty meal to five hungry babes．Among these there was one which attracted my mother far above all the rest．She appeared of a different stock．The four others were dark-eyed，hardy little vagrants；this child was thin and very fair．Her hair was the brightest living gold，and despite the poverty of her clothing，seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head．Her brow was clear and ample，her blue eyes cloudless，and her lips and the moulding of her face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold her without looking on her as of a distinct species，a being heaven-sent，and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features．

The peasant woman，perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and admiration on this lovely girl，eagerly communicated her history．She was not her child，but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman．Her mother was a German and had died on giving her birth．The infant had been placed with these good people to nurse：they were better off then．They had not been long married，and their eldest child was but just born．The father of their charge was one of those Italians nursed in the memory of the antique glory of Italy—one among the schiavi ognor frementi，who exerted himself to obtain the liberty of his country．He became the victim of its weakness．Whether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of Austria was not known．His property was confiscated；his child became an orphan and a beggar．She continued with her foster parents and bloomed in their rude abode，fairer than a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles．

When my father returned from Milan，he found playing with me in the hall of our villa a child fairer than pictured cherub—a creature who seemed to shed radiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighter than the chamois of the hills．The apparition was soon explained．With his permission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their charge to her．They were fond of the sweet orphan．Her presence had seemed a blessing to them，but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty and want when Providence afforded her such powerful protection．They consulted their village priest，and the result was that Elizabeth Lavenza became the inmate of my parents' house—my more than sister—the beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations and my pleasures．

Everyone loved Elizabeth．The passionate and almost reverential attachment with which all regarded her became，while I shared it，my pride and my delight．On the evening previous to her being brought to my home，my mother had said playfully，“I have a pretty present for my Victor—tomorrow he shall have it．”And when，on the morrow，she presented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift，I，with childish seriousness，interpreted her words literally and looked upon Elizabeth as mine—mine to protect，love，and cherish．All praises bestowed on her I received as made to a possession of my own．We called each other familiarly by the name of cousin．No word，no expression could body forth the kind of relation in which she stood to me—my more than sister，since till death she was to be mine only．





Chapter 2


We were brought up together；there was not quite a year difference in our ages．I need not say that we were strangers to any species of disunion or dispute．Harmony was the soul of our companionship，and the diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us nearer together．Elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated disposition；but，with all my ardour，I was capable of a more intense application and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge．She busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets；and in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss home—the sublime shapes of the mountains，the changes of the seasons，tempest and calm，the silence of winter，and the life and turbulence of our Alpine summers—she found ample scope for admiration and delight．While my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the magnificent appearances of things，I delighted in investigating their causes．The world was to me a secret which I desired to divine．Curiosity，earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature，gladness akin to rapture，as they were unfolded to me，are among the earliest sensations I can remember．

On the birth of a second son，my junior by seven years，my parents gave up entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their native country．We possessed a house in Geneva，and a campagne on Belrive，the eastern shore of the lake，at the distance of rather more than a league from the city．We resided principally in the latter，and the lives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion．It was my temper to avoid a crowd and to attach myself fervently to a few．I was indifferent，therefore，to my schoolfellows in general；but I united myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them．Henry Clerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva．He was a boy of singular talent and fancy．He loved enterprise，hardship，and even danger for its own sake．He was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance．He composed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and knightly adventure．He tried to make us act plays and to enter into masquerades，in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of Roncesvalles，of the Round Table of King Arthur，and the chivalrous train who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands of the infidels．

No human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself．My parents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence．We felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to their caprice，but the agents and creators of all the many delights which we enjoyed．When I mingled with other families I distinctly discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was，and gratitude assisted the development of filial love．

My temper was sometimes violent，and my passions vehement；but by some law in my temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits but to an eager desire to learn，and not to learn all things indiscriminately．I confess that neither the structure of languages，nor the code of governments，nor the politics of various states possessed attractions for me．It was the secrets of heaven and earth that I desired to learn；and whether it was the outward substance of things or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man that occupied me，still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical，or in its highest sense，the physical secrets of the world．

Meanwhile Clerval occupied himself，so to speak，with the moral relations of things．The busy stage of life，the virtues of heroes，and the actions of men were his theme；and his hope and his dream was to become one among those whose names are recorded in story as the gallant and adventurous benefactors of our species．The saintly soul of Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful home．Her sympathy was ours；her smile，her soft voice，the sweet glance of her celestial eyes，were ever there to bless and animate us．She was the living spirit of love to soften and attract；I might have become sullen in my study，rough through the ardour of my nature，but that she was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness．And Clerval—could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of Clerval？Yet he might not have been so perfectly humane，so thoughtful in his generosity，so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for adventurous exploit，had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of beneficence and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring ambition．

I feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood，before misfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright visions of extensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self．Besides，in drawing the picture of my early days，I also record those events which led，by insensible steps，to my after tale of misery，for when I would account to myself for the birth of that passion which afterwards ruled my destiny I find it arise，like a mountain river，from ignoble and almost forgotten sources；but，swelling as it proceeded，it became the torrent which，in its course，has swept away all my hopes and joys．

Natural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate；I desire，therefore，in this narration，to state those facts which led to my predilection for that science．When I was thirteen years of age we all went on a party of pleasure to the baths near Thonon；the inclemency of the weather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn．In this house I chanced to find a volume of the works of Cornelius Agrippa．I opened it with apathy；the theory which he attempts to demonstrate and the wonderful facts which he relates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm．A new light seemed to dawn upon my mind，and bounding with joy，I communicated my discovery to my father．My father looked carelessly at the title page of my book and said，“Ah！Cornelius Agrippa！My dear Victor，do not waste your time upon this；it is sad trash．”

If，instead of this remark，my father had taken the pains to explain to me that the principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded and that a modern system of science had been introduced which possessed much greater powers than the ancient，because the powers of the latter were chimerical，while those of the former were real and practical，under such circumstances I should certainly have thrown Agrippa aside and have contented my imagination，warmed as it was，by returning with greater ardour to my former studies．It is even possible that the train of my ideas would never have received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin．But the cursory glance my father had taken of my volume by no means assured me that he was acquainted with its contents，and I continued to read with the greatest avidity．

When I returned home my first care was to procure the whole works of this author，and afterwards of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus．I read and studied the wild fancies of these writers with delight；they appeared to me treasures known to few besides myself．I have described myself as always having been imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of nature．In spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of modern philosophers，I always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied．Sir Isaac Newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking up shells beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth．Those of his successors in each branch of natural philosophy with whom I was acquainted appeared even to my boy's apprehensions as tyros engaged in the same pursuit．

The untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted with their practical uses．The most learned philosopher knew little more．He had partially unveiled the face of Nature，but her immortal lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery．He might dissect，anatomize，and give names；but，not to speak of a final cause，causes in their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him．I had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep human beings from entering the citadel of nature，and rashly and ignorantly I had repined．

But here were books，and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew more．I took their word for all that they averred，and I became their disciple．It may appear strange that such should arise in the eighteenth century；but while I followed the routine of education in the schools of Geneva，I was，to a great degree，self-taught with regard to my favourite studies．My father was not scientific，and I was left to struggle with a child's blindness，added to a student's thirst for knowledge．Under the guidance of my new preceptors I entered with the greatest diligence into the search of the philosopher's stone and the elixir of life；but the latter soon obtained my undivided attention．Wealth was an inferior object，but what glory would attend the discovery if I could banish disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death！

Nor were these my only visions．The raising of ghosts or devils was a promise liberally accorded by my favourite authors，the fulfilment of which I most eagerly sought；and if my incantations were always unsuccessful，I attributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake than to a want of skill or fidelity in my instructors．And thus for a time I was occupied by exploded systems，mingling，like an unadept，a thousand contradictory theories and floundering desperately in a very slough of multifarious knowledge，guided by an ardent imagination and childish reasoning，till an accident again changed the current of my ideas．

When I was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near Belrive，when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm．It advanced from behind the mountains of Jura，and the thunder burst at once with frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens．I remained，while the storm lasted，watching its progress with curiosity and delight．As I stood at the door，on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire issue from an old and beautiful oak which stood about twenty yards from our house；and so soon as the dazzling light vanished，the oak had disappeared，and nothing remained but a blasted stump．When we visited it the next morning，we found the tree shattered in a singular manner．It was not splintered by the shock，but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood．I never beheld anything so utterly destroyed．

Before this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of electricity．On this occasion a man of great research in natural philosophy was with us，and excited by this catastrophe，he entered on the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of electricity and galvanism，which was at once new and astonishing to me．All that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa，Albertus Magnus，and Paracelsus，the lords of my imagination；but by some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my accustomed studies．It seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever be known．All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew despicable．By one of those caprices of the mind which we are perhaps most subject to in early youth，I at once gave up my former occupations，set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed and abortive creation，and entertained the greatest disdain for a would-be science which could never even step within the threshold of real knowledge．In this mood of mind I betook myself to the mathematics and the branches of study appertaining to that science as being built upon secure foundations，and so worthy of my consideration．

Thus strangely are our souls constructed，and by such slight ligaments are we bound to prosperity or ruin．When I look back，it seems to me as if this almost miraculous change of inclination and will was the immediate suggestion of the guardian angel of my life—the last effort made by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even then hanging in the stars and ready to envelop me．Her victory was announced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul which followed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting studies．It was thus that I was to be taught to associate evil with their prosecution，happiness with their disregard．

It was a strong effort of the spirit of good，but it was ineffectual．Destiny was too potent，and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and terrible destruction．





Chapter 3


When I had attained the age of seventeen my parents resolved that I should become a student at the university of Ingolstadt．I had hitherto attended the schools of Geneva，but my father thought it necessary for the completion of my education that I should be made acquainted with other customs than those of my native country．My departure was therefore fixed at an early date，but before the day resolved upon could arrive，the first misfortune of my life occurred—an omen，as it were，of my future misery．

Elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever；her illness was severe，and she was in the greatest danger．During her illness many arguments had been urged to persuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her．She had at first yielded to our entreaties，but when she heard that the life of her favourite was menaced，she could no longer control her anxiety．She attended her sickbed；her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity of the distemper—Elizabeth was saved，but the consequences of this imprudence were fatal to her preserver．On the third day my mother sickened；her fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms，and the looks of her medical attendants prognosticated the worst event．On her deathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not desert her．She joined the hands of Elizabeth and myself．“My children，”she said，“my firmest hopes of future happiness were placed on the prospect of your union．This expectation will now be the consolation of your father．Elizabeth，my love，you must supply my place to my younger children．Alas！I regret that I am taken from you；and，happy and beloved as I have been，is it not hard to quit you all？But these are not thoughts befitting me；I will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to death and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world．”

She died calmly，and her countenance expressed affection even in death．I need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent by that most irreparable evil，the void that presents itself to the soul，and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance．It is so long before the mind can persuade itself that she whom we saw every day and whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departed forever—that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been extinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and dear to the ear can be hushed，never more to be heard．These are the reflections of the first days；but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the evil，then the actual bitterness of grief commences．Yet from whom has not that rude hand rent away some dear connection？And why should I describe a sorrow which all have felt，and must feel？The time at length arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity；and the smile that plays upon the lips，although it may be deemed a sacrilege，is not banished．My mother was dead，but we had still duties which we ought to perform；we must continue our course with the rest and learn to think ourselves fortunate whilst one remains whom the spoiler has not seized．

My departure for Ingolstadt，which had been deferred by these events，was now again determined upon．I obtained from my father a respite of some weeks．It appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose，akin to death，of the house of mourning and to rush into the thick of life．I was new to sorrow，but it did not the less alarm me．I was unwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me，and above all，I desired to see my sweet Elizabeth in some degree consoled．

She indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to us all．She looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage and zeal．She devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call her uncle and cousins．Never was she so enchanting as at this time，when she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us．She forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget．

The day of my departure at length arrived．Clerval spent the last evening with us．He had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit him to accompany me and to become my fellow student，but in vain．His father was a narrow-minded trader and saw idleness and ruin in the aspirations and ambition of his son．Henry deeply felt the misfortune of being debarred from a liberal education．He said little，but when he spoke I read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance a restrained but firm resolve not to be chained to the miserable details of commerce．

We sat late．We could not tear ourselves away from each other nor persuade ourselves to say the word“Farewell！”It was said，and we retired under the pretence of seeking repose，each fancying that the other was deceived；but when at morning's dawn I descended to the carriage which was to convey me away，they were all there—my father again to bless me，Clerval to press my hand once more，my Elizabeth to renew her entreaties that I would write often and to bestow the last feminine attentions on her playmate and friend．

I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged in the most melancholy reflections．I，who had ever been surrounded by amiable companions，continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual pleasure—I was now alone．In the university whither I was going I must form my own friends and be my own protector．My life had hitherto been remarkably secluded and domestic，and this had given me invincible repugnance to new countenances．I loved my brothers，Elizabeth，and Clerval；these were“old familiar faces，”but I believed myself totally unfitted for the company of strangers．Such were my reflections as I commenced my journey；but as I proceeded，my spirits and hopes rose．I ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge．I had often，when at home，thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and had longed to enter the world and take my station among other human beings．Now my desires were complied with，and it would，indeed，have been folly to repent．

I had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my journey to Ingolstadt，which was long and fatiguing．At length the high white steeple of the town met my eyes．I alighted and was conducted to my solitary apartment to spend the evening as I pleased．

The next morning I delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visit to some of the principal professors．Chance—or rather the evil influence，the Angel of Destruction，which asserted omnipotent sway over me from the moment I turned my reluctant steps from my father's door—led me first to M．Krempe，professor of natural philosophy．He was an uncouth man，but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science．He asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches of science appertaining to natural philosophy．I replied carelessly，and partly in contempt，mentioned the names of my alchemists as the principal authors I had studied．The professor stared．“Have you，”he said，“really spent your time in studying such nonsense？”

I replied in the affirmative．“Every minute，”continued M．Krempe with warmth，“every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly and entirely lost．You have burdened your memory with exploded systems and useless names．Good God！In what desert land have you lived，where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you have so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they are ancient？I little expected，in this enlightened and scientific age，to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus．My dear sir，you must begin your studies entirely anew．”

So saying，he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books treating of natural philosophy which he desired me to procure，and dismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the following week he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural philosophy in its general relations，and that M．Waldman，a fellow professor，would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he omitted．

I returned home not disappointed，for I have said that I had long considered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated；but I returned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any shape．M．Krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and a repulsive countenance；the teacher，therefore，did not prepossess me in favour of his pursuits．In rather a too philosophical and connected a strain，perhaps，I have given an account of the conclusions I had come to concerning them in my early years．As a child I had not been content with the results promised by the modern professors of natural science．With a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my extreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters，I had retrod the steps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the discoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists．Besides，I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy．It was very different when the masters of the science sought immortality and power；such views，although futile，were grand；but now the scene was changed．The ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in science was chiefly founded．I was required to exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur for realities of little worth．

Such were my reflections during the first two or three days of my residence at Ingolstadt，which were chiefly spent in becoming acquainted with the localities and the principal residents in my new abode．But as the ensuing week commenced，I thought of the information which M．Krempe had given me concerning the lectures．And although I could not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver sentences out of a pulpit，I recollected what he had said of M．Waldman，whom I had never seen，as he had hitherto been out of town．

Partly from curiosity and partly from idleness，I went into the lecturing room，which M．Waldman entered shortly after．This professor was very unlike his colleague．He appeared about fifty years of age，but with an aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence；a few grey hairs covered his temples，but those at the back of his head were nearly black．His person was short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard．He began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and the various improvements made by different men of learning，pronouncing with fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers．He then took a cursory view of the present state of the science and explained many of its elementary terms．After having made a few preparatory experiments，he concluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry，the terms of which I shall never forget：

“The ancient teachers of this science，”said he，“promised impossibilities and performed nothing．The modern masters promise very little；they know that metals cannot be transmuted and that the elixir of life is a chimera．But these philosophers，whose hands seem only made to dabble in dirt，and their eyes to pore over the microscope or crucible，have indeed performed miracles．They penetrate into the recesses of nature and show how she works in her hiding-places．They ascend into the heavens；they have discovered how the blood circulates，and the nature of the air we breathe．They have acquired new and almost unlimited powers；they can command the thunders of heaven，mimic the earthquake，and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows．”

Such were the professor's words—rather let me say such the words of the fate—enounced to destroy me．As he went on I felt as if my soul were grappling with a palpable enemy；one by one the various keys were touched which formed the mechanism of my being；chord after chord was sounded，and soon my mind was filled with one thought，one conception，one purpose．So much has been done，exclaimed the soul of Frankenstein—more，far more，will I achieve；treading in the steps already marked，I will pioneer a new way，explore unknown powers，and unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation．

I closed not my eyes that night．My internal being was in a state of insurrection and turmoil；I felt that order would thence arise，but I had no power to produce it．By degrees，after the morning's dawn，sleep came．I awoke，and my yesternight's thoughts were as a dream．There only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to devote myself to a science for which I believed myself to possess a natural talent．On the same day I paid M．Waldman a visit．His manners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public，for there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in his own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness．I gave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as I had given to his fellow professor．He heard with attention the little narration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of Cornelius Agrippa and Paracelsus，but without the contempt that M．Krempe had exhibited．He said that“These were men to whose indefatigable zeal modern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their knowledge．They had left to us，as an easier task，to give new names and arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light．The labours of men of genius，however erroneously directed，scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind．”I listened to his statement，which was delivered without any presumption or affectation，and then added that his lecture had removed my prejudices against modern chemists；I expressed myself in measured terms，with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his instructor，without letting escape（inexperience in life would have made me ashamed）any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended labours．I requested his advice concerning the books I ought to procure．

“I am happy，”said M．Waldman，“to have gained a disciple；and if your application equals your ability，I have no doubt of your success．Chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the greatest improvements have been and may be made；it is on that account that I have made it my peculiar study；but at the same time，I have not neglected the other branches of science．A man would make but a very sorry chemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone．If your wish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty experimentalist，I should advise you to apply to every branch of natural philosophy，including mathematics．”

He then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his various machines，instructing me as to what I ought to procure and promising me the use of his own when I should have advanced far enough in the science not to derange their mechanism．He also gave me the list of books which I had requested，and I took my leave．

Thus ended a day memorable to me；it decided my future destiny．





Chapter 4


From this day natural philosophy，and particularly chemistry，in the most comprehensive sense of the term，became nearly my sole occupation．I read with ardour those works，so full of genius and discrimination，which modern inquirers have written on these subjects．I attended the lectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the university，and I found even in M．Krempe a great deal of sound sense and real information，combined，it is true，with a repulsive physiognomy and manners，but not on that account the less valuable．In M．Waldman I found a true friend．His gentleness was never tinged by dogmatism，and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and good nature that banished every idea of pedantry．In a thousand ways he smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse inquiries clear and facile to my apprehension．My application was at first fluctuating and uncertain；it gained strength as I proceeded and soon became so ardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in the light of morning whilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory．

As I applied so closely，it may be easily conceived that my progress was rapid．My ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students，and my proficiency that of the masters．Professor Krempe often asked me，with a sly smile，how Cornelius Agrippa went on，whilst M．Waldman expressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress．Two years passed in this manner，during which I paid no visit to Geneva，but was engaged，heart and soul，in the pursuit of some discoveries which I hoped to make．None but those who have experienced them can conceive of the enticements of science．In other studies you go as far as others have gone before you，and there is nothing more to know；but in a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder．A mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must infallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study；and I，who continually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was solely wrapped up in this，improved so rapidly that at the end of two years I made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical instruments，which procured me great esteem and admiration at the university．When I had arrived at this point and had become as well acquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as depended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt，my residence there being no longer conducive to my improvements，I thought of returning to my friends and my native town，when an incident happened that protracted my stay．

One of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was the structure of the human frame，and，indeed，any animal endued with life．Whence，I often asked myself，did the principle of life proceed？It was a bold question，and one which has ever been considered as a mystery；yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming acquainted，if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our inquiries．I revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of natural philosophy which relate to physiology．Unless I had been animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm，my application to this study would have been irksome and almost intolerable．To examine the causes of life，we must first have recourse to death．I became acquainted with the science of anatomy，but this was not sufficient；I must also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body．In my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors．I do not ever remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared the apparition of a spirit．Darkness had no effect upon my fancy，and a churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of life，which，from being the seat of beauty and strength，had become food for the worm．Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of this decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and charnel-houses．My attention was fixed upon every object the most insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings．I saw how the fine form of man was degraded and wasted；I beheld the corruption of death succeed to the blooming cheek of life；I saw how the worm inherited the wonders of the eye and brain．I paused，examining and analysing all the minutiae of causation，as exemplified in the change from life to death，and death to life，until from the midst of this darkness a sudden light broke in upon me—a light so brilliant and wondrous，yet so simple，that while I became dizzy with the immensity of the prospect which it illustrated，I was surprised that among so many men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same science，that I alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a secret．

Remember，I am not recording the vision of a madman．The sun does not more certainly shine in the heavens than that which I now affirm is true．Some miracle might have produced it，yet the stages of the discovery were distinct and probable．After days and nights of incredible labour and fatigue，I succeeded in discovering the cause of generation and life；nay，more，I became myself capable of bestowing animation upon lifeless matter．

The astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery soon gave place to delight and rapture．After so much time spent in painful labour，to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the most gratifying consummation of my toils．But this discovery was so great and overwhelming that all the steps by which I had been progressively led to it were obliterated，and I beheld only the result．What had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation of the world was now within my grasp．Not that，like a magic scene，it all opened upon me at once：the information I had obtained was of a nature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I should point them towards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already accomplished．I was like the Arabian who had been buried with the dead and found a passage to life，aided only by one glimmering and seemingly ineffectual light．

I see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes express，my friend，that you expect to be informed of the secret with which I am acquainted；that cannot be；listen patiently until the end of my story，and you will easily perceive why I am reserved upon that subject．I will not lead you on，unguarded and ardent as I then was，to your destruction and infallible misery．Learn from me，if not by my precepts，at least by my example，how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town to be the world，than he who aspires to become greater than his nature will allow．

When I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands，I hesitated a long time concerning the manner in which I should employ it．Although I possessed the capacity of bestowing animation，yet to prepare a frame for the reception of it，with all its intricacies of fibres，muscles，and veins，still remained a work of inconceivable difficulty and labour．I doubted at first whether I should attempt the creation of a being like myself，or one of simpler organization；but my imagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to doubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful as man．The materials at present within my command hardly appeared adequate to so arduous an undertaking，but I doubted not that I should ultimately succeed．I prepared myself for a multitude of reverses；my operations might be incessantly baffled，and at last my work be imperfect，yet when I considered the improvement which every day takes place in science and mechanics，I was encouraged to hope my present attempts would at least lay the foundations of future success．Nor could I consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any argument of its impracticability．It was with these feelings that I began the creation of a human being．As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed，I resolved，contrary to my first intention，to make the being of a gigantic stature，that is to say，about eight feet in height，and proportionably large．After having formed this determination and having spent some months in successfully collecting and arranging my materials，I began．

No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards，like a hurricane，in the first enthusiasm of success．Life and death appeared to me ideal bounds，which I should first break through，and pour a torrent of light into our dark world．A new species would bless me as its creator and source；many happy and excellent natures would owe their being to me．No father could claim the gratitude of his child so completely as I should deserve theirs．Pursuing these reflections，I thought that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless matter，I might in process of time（although I now found it impossible）renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption．

These thoughts supported my spirits，while I pursued my undertaking with unremitting ardour．My cheek had grown pale with study，and my person had become emaciated with confinement．Sometimes，on the very brink of certainty，I failed；yet still I clung to the hope which the next day or the next hour might realize．One secret which I alone possessed was the hope to which I had dedicated myself；and the moon gazed on my midnight labours，while，with unrelaxed and breathless eagerness，I pursued nature to her hiding-places．Who shall conceive the horrors of my secret toil as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps of the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless clay？My limbs now tremble，and my eyes swim with the remembrance；but then a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward；I seemed to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit．It was indeed but a passing trance，that only made me feel with renewed acuteness so soon as，the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate，I had returned to my old habits．I collected bones from charnel-houses and disturbed，with profane fingers，the tremendous secrets of the human frame．In a solitary chamber，or rather cell，at the top of the house，and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase，I kept my workshop of filthy creation；my eyeballs were starting from their sockets in attending to the details of my employment．The dissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials；and often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation，whilst，still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased，I brought my work near to a conclusion．

The summer months passed while I was thus engaged，heart and soul，in one pursuit．It was a most beautiful season；never did the fields bestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant vintage，but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature．And the same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also to forget those friends who were so many miles absent，and whom I had not seen for so long a time．I knew my silence disquieted them，and I well remembered the words of my father：“I know that while you are pleased with yourself you will think of us with affection，and we shall hear regularly from you．You must pardon me if I regard any interruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties are equally neglected．”

I knew well therefore what would be my father's feelings，but I could not tear my thoughts from my employment，loathsome in itself，but which had taken an irresistible hold of my imagination．I wished，as it were，to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection until the great object，which swallowed up every habit of my nature，should be completed．

I then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect to vice or faultiness on my part，but I am now convinced that he was justified in conceiving that I should not be altogether free from blame．A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to disturb his tranquillity．I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge is an exception to this rule．If the study to which you apply yourself has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix，then that study is certainly unlawful，that is to say，not befitting the human mind．If this rule were always observed；if no man allowed any pursuit whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic affections，Greece had not been enslaved，Caesar would have spared his country，America would have been discovered more gradually，and the empires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed．

But I forget that I am moralizing in the most interesting part of my tale，and your looks remind me to proceed．

My father made no reproach in his letters and only took notice of my silence by inquiring into my occupations more particularly than before．Winter，spring，and summer passed away during my labours；but I did not watch the blossom or the expanding leaves—sights which before always yielded me supreme delight—so deeply was I engrossed in my occupation．The leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near to a close，and now every day showed me more plainly how well I had succeeded．But my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety，and I appeared rather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines，or any other unwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite employment．Every night I was oppressed by a slow fever，and I became nervous to a most painful degree；the fall of a leaf startled me，and I shunned my fellow creatures as if I had been guilty of a crime．Sometimes I grew alarmed at the wreck I perceived that I had become；the energy of my purpose alone sustained me：my labours would soon end，and I believed that exercise and amusement would then drive away incipient disease；and I promised myself both of these when my creation should be complete．





Chapter 5


It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplish-ment of my toils．With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony，I collected the instruments of life around me，that I might infuse a spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet．It was already one in the morning；the rain pattered dismally against the panes，and my candle was nearly burnt out，when，by the glimmer of the half-extinguished light，I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open；it breathed hard，and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs．

How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe，or how delineate the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form？His limbs were in proportion，and I had selected his features as beautiful．Beautiful！Great God！His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath；his hair was of a lustrous black，and flowing；his teeth of a pearly whiteness；but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes，that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which they were set，his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips．

The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of human nature．I had worked hard for nearly two years，for the sole purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body．For this I had deprived myself of rest and health．I had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation；but now that I had finished，the beauty of the dream vanished，and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart．Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created，I rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my bed chamber，unable to compose my mind to sleep．At length lassitude succeeded to the tumult I had before endured，and I threw myself on the bed in my clothes，endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness．But it was in vain；I slept，indeed，but I was disturbed by the wildest dreams．I thought I saw Elizabeth，in the bloom of health，walking in the streets of Ingolstadt．Delighted and surprised，I embraced her，but as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips，they became livid with the hue of death；her features appeared to change，and I thought that I held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms；a shroud enveloped her form，and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel．I started from my sleep with horror；a cold dew covered my forehead，my teeth chattered，and every limb became convulsed；when，by the dim and yellow light of the moon，as it forced its way through the window shutters，I beheld the wretch—the miserable monster whom I had created．He held up the curtain of the bed；and his eyes，if eyes they may be called，were fixed on me．His jaws opened，and he muttered some inarticulate sounds，while a grin wrinkled his cheeks．He might have spoken，but I did not hear；one hand was stretched out，seemingly to detain me，but I escaped and rushed downstairs．I took refuge in the courtyard belonging to the house which I inhabited，where I remained during the rest of the night，walking up and down in the greatest agitation，listening attentively，catching and fearing each sound as if it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which I had so miserably given life．

Oh！No mortal could support the horror of that countenance．A mummy again endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch．I had gazed on him while unfinished；he was ugly then，but when those muscles and joints were rendered capable of motion，it became a thing such as even Dante could not have conceived．

I passed the night wretchedly．Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and hardly that I felt the palpitation of every artery；at others，I nearly sank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness．Mingled with this horror，I felt the bitterness of disappointment；dreams that had been my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now become a hell to me；and the change was so rapid，the overthrow so complete！

Morning，dismal and wet，at length dawned and discovered to my sleepless and aching eyes the church of Ingolstadt，its white steeple and clock，which indicated the sixth hour．The porter opened the gates of the court，which had that night been my asylum，and I issued into the streets，pacing them with quick steps，as if I sought to avoid the wretch whom I feared every turning of the street would present to my view．I did not dare return to the apartment which I inhabited，but felt impelled to hurry on，although drenched by the rain which poured from a black and comfortless sky．

I continued walking in this manner for some time，endeavouring by bodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind．I traversed the streets without any clear conception of where I was or what I was doing．My heart palpitated in the sickness of fear，and I hurried on with irregular steps，not daring to look about me：

Like one who，on a lonely road，

Doth walk in fear and dread，

And，having once turned round，walks on，

And turns no more his head；

Because he knows a frightful fiend

Doth close behind him tread．(1)

Continuing thus，I came at length opposite to the inn at which the various diligences and carriages usually stopped．Here I paused，I knew not why；but I remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was coming towards me from the other end of the street．As it drew nearer I observed that it was the Swiss diligence；it stopped just where I was standing，and on the door being opened，I perceived Henry Clerval，who，on seeing me，instantly sprung out．“My dear Frankenstein，”exclaimed he，“how glad I am to see you！How fortunate that you should be here at the very moment of my alighting！”

Nothing could equal my delight on seeing Clerval；his presence brought back to my thoughts my father，Elizabeth，and all those scenes of home so dear to my recollection．I grasped his hand，and in a moment forgot my horror and misfortune；I felt suddenly，and for the first time during many months，calm and serene joy．I welcomed my friend，therefore，in the most cordial manner，and we walked towards my college．Clerval continued talking for some time about our mutual friends and his own good fortune in being permitted to come to Ingolstadt．“You may easily believe，”said he，“how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that all necessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of book-keeping；and，indeed，I believe I left him incredulous to the last，for his constant answer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the Dutch schoolmaster in The Vicar of Wakefield：‘I have ten thousand florins a year without Greek，I eat heartily without Greek．’ But his affection for me at length overcame his dislike of learning，and he has permitted me to undertake a voyage of discovery to the land of knowledge．”

“It gives me the greatest delight to see you；but tell me how you left my father，brothers，and Elizabeth．”

“Very well，and very happy，only a little uneasy that they hear from you so seldom．By the by，I mean to lecture you a little upon their account myself．But，my dear Frankenstein，”continued he，stopping short and gazing full in my face，“I did not before remark how very ill you appear；so thin and pale；you look as if you had been watching for several nights．”

“You have guessed right；I have lately been so deeply engaged in one occupation that I have not allowed myself sufficient rest，as you see；but I hope，I sincerely hope，that all these employments are now at an end and that I am at length free．”

I trembled excessively；I could not endure to think of，and far less to allude to，the occurrences of the preceding night．I walked with a quick pace，and we soon arrived at my college．I then reflected，and the thought made me shiver，that the creature whom I had left in my apartment might still be there，alive and walking about．I dreaded to behold this monster，but I feared still more that Henry should see him．Entreating him，therefore，to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the stairs，I darted up towards my own room．My hand was already on the lock of the door before I recollected myself．I then paused，and a cold shivering came over me．I threw the door forcibly open，as children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in waiting for them on the other side；but nothing appeared．I stepped fearfully in：the apartment was empty，and my bedroom was also freed from its hideous guest．I could hardly believe that so great a good fortune could have befallen me，but when I became assured that my enemy had indeed fled，I clapped my hands for joy and ran down to Clerval．

We ascended into my room，and the servant presently brought breakfast；but I was unable to contain myself．It was not joy only that possessed me；I felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness，and my pulse beat rapidly．I was unable to remain for a single instant in the same place；I jumped over the chairs，clapped my hands，and laughed aloud．Clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival，but when he observed me more attentively，he saw a wildness in my eyes for which he could not account，and my loud，unrestrained，heartless laughter frightened and astonished him．

“My dear Victor，”cried he，“what，for God's sake，is the matter？Do not laugh in that manner．How ill you are！What is the cause of all this？”

“Do not ask me，”cried I，putting my hands before my eyes，for I thought I saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room；“he can tell．Oh，save me！Save me！”I imagined that the monster seized me；I struggled furiously and fell down in a fit．

Poor Clerval！What must have been his feelings？A meeting，which he anticipated with such joy，so strangely turned to bitterness．But I was not the witness of his grief，for I was lifeless and did not recover my senses for a long，long time．

This was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for several months．During all that time Henry was my only nurse．I afterwards learned that，knowing my father's advanced age and unfitness for so long a journey，and how wretched my sickness would make Elizabeth，he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my disorder．He knew that I could not have a more kind and attentive nurse than himself；and，firm in the hope he felt of my recovery，he did not doubt that，instead of doing harm，he performed the kindest action that he could towards them．

But I was in reality very ill，and surely nothing but the unbounded and unremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life．The form of the monster on whom I had bestowed existence was forever before my eyes，and I raved incessantly concerning him．Doubtless my words surprised Henry；he at first believed them to be the wanderings of my disturbed imagination，but the pertinacity with which I continually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event．

By very slow degrees，and with frequent relapses that alarmed and grieved my friend，I recovered．I remember the first time I became capable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure，I perceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the young buds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window．It was a divine spring，and the season contributed greatly to my convalescence．I felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in my bosom；my gloom disappeared，and in a short time I became as cheerful as before I was attacked by the fatal passion．

“Dearest Clerval，”exclaimed I，“how kind，how very good you are to me．This whole winter，instead of being spent in study，as you promised yourself，has been consumed in my sick room．How shall I ever repay you？I feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment of which I have been the occasion，but you will forgive me．”

“You will repay me entirely if you do not discompose yourself，but get well as fast as you can；and since you appear in such good spirits，I may speak to you on one subject，may I not？”

I trembled．One subject！What could it be？Could he allude to an object on whom I dared not even think？

“Compose yourself，”said Clerval，who observed my change of colour，“I will not mention it if it agitates you；but your father and cousin would be very happy if they received a letter from you in your own handwriting．They hardly know how ill you have been and are uneasy at your long silence．”

“Is that all，my dear Henry？How could you suppose that my first thought would not fly towards those dear，dear friends whom I love and who are so deserving of my love？”

“If this is your present temper，my friend，you will perhaps be glad to see a letter that has been lying here some days for you；it is from your cousin，I believe．”

Chapter 6


Clerval then put the following letter into my hands．It was from my own Elizabeth：

My dearest Cousin，

You have been ill，very ill，and even the constant letters of dear kind Henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account．You are forbidden to write—to hold a pen；yet one word from you，dear Victor，is necessary to calm our apprehensions．For a long time I have thought that each post would bring this line，and my persuasions have restrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt．I have prevented his encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so long a journey，yet how often have I regretted not being able to perform it myself！I figure to myself that the task of attending on your sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse，who could never guess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of your poor cousin．Yet that is over now：Clerval writes that indeed you are getting better．I eagerly hope that you will confirm this intelligence soon in your own handwriting．

Get well—and return to us．You will find a happy，cheerful home and friends who love you dearly．Your father's health is vigorous，and he asks but to see you，but to be assured that you are well；and not a care will ever cloud his benevolent countenance．How pleased you would be to remark the improvement of our Ernest！He is now sixteen and full of activity and spirit．He is desirous to be a true Swiss and to enter into foreign service，but we cannot part with him，at least until his elder brother returns to us．My uncle is not pleased with the idea of a military career in a distant country，but Ernest never had your powers of application．He looks upon study as an odious fetter；his time is spent in the open air，climbing the hills or rowing on the lake．I fear that he will become an idler unless we yield the point and permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected．

Little alteration，except the growth of our dear children，has taken place since you left us．The blue lake and snow-clad mountains—they never change；and I think our placid home and our contented hearts are regulated by the same immutable laws．My trifling occupations take up my time and amuse me，and I am rewarded for any exertions by seeing none but happy，kind faces around me．Since you left us，but one change has taken place in our little household．Do you remember on what occasion Justine Moritz entered our family？Probably you do not；I will relate her history，therefore，in a few words．Madame Moritz，her mother，was a widow with four children，of whom Justine was the third．This girl had always been the favourite of her father，but through a strange perversity，her mother could not endure her，and after the death of M．Moritz，treated her very ill．My aunt observed this，and when Justine was twelve years of age，prevailed on her mother to allow her to live at our house．The republican institutions of our country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which prevail in the great monarchies that surround it．Hence there is less distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants；and the lower orders，being neither so poor nor so despised，their manners are more refined and moral．A servant in Geneva does not mean the same thing as a servant in France and England．Justine，thus received in our family，learned the duties of a servant，a condition which，in our fortunate country，does not include the idea of ignorance and a sacrifice of the dignity of a human being．

Justine，you may remember，was a great favourite of yours；and I recollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour，one glance from Justine could dissipate it，for the same reason that Ariosto gives concerning the beauty of Angelica—she looked so frank-hearted and happy．My aunt conceived a great attachment for her，by which she was induced to give her an education superior to that which she had at first intended．This benefit was fully repaid；Justine was the most grateful little creature in the world：I do not mean that she made any professions；I never heard one pass her kips，but you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress．Although her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate，yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt．She thought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her phraseology and manners，so that even now she often reminds me of her．

When my dearest aunt died everyone was too much occupied in their own grief to notice poor Justine，who had attended her during her illness with the most anxious affection．Poor Justine was very ill，but other trials were reserved for her．

One by one，her brothers and sister died；and her mother，with the exception of her neglected daughter，was left childless．The conscience of the woman was troubled；she began to think that the deaths of her favourites was a judgment from heaven to chastise her partiality．She was a Roman Catholic；and I believe her confessor confirmed the idea which she had conceived．Accordingly，a few months after your departure for Ingolstadt，Justine was called home by her repentant mother．Poor girl！She wept when she quitted our house；she was much altered since the death of my aunt；grief had given softness and a winning mildness to her manners which had before been remarkable for vivacity．Nor was her residence at her mother's house of a nature to restore her gaiety．The poor woman was very vacillating in her repentance．She sometimes begged Justine to forgive her unkindness but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her brothers and sister．Perpetual fretting at length threw Madame Moritz into a decline，which at first increased her irritability，but she is now at peace forever．She died on the first approach of cold weather，at the beginning of this last winter．Justine has returned to us，and I assure you I love her tenderly．She is very clever and gentle and extremely pretty；as I mentioned before，her mien and her expressions continually remind me of my dear aunt．

I must say also a few words to you，my dear cousin，of little darling William．I wish you could see him；he is very tall of his age，with sweet laughing blue eyes，dark eyelashes，and curling hair．When he smiles，two little dimples appear on each cheek，which are rosy with health．He has already had one or two little wives，but Louisa Biron is his favourite，a pretty little girl of five years of age．

Now，dear Victor，I dare say you wish to be indulged in a little gossip concerning the good people of Geneva．The pretty Miss Mansfield has already received the congratulatory visits on her approaching marriage with a young Englishman，John Melbourne，Esq．Her ugly sister，Manon，married M．Duvillard，the rich banker，last autumn．Your favourite schoolfellow，Louis Manoir，has suffered several misfortunes since the departure of Clerval from Geneva．But he has already recovered his spirits，and is reported to be on the point of marrying a very lively，pretty Frenchwoman，Madame Tavernier．She is a widow，and much older than Manoir，but she is very much admired and a favourite with everybody．

I have written myself into better spirits，dear cousin；but my anxiety returns upon me as I conclude．Write，dearest Victor—one line—one word will be a blessing to us．Ten thousand thanks to Henry for his kindness，his affection，and his many letters；we are sincerely grateful．Adieu！My cousin，take care of yourself，and，I entreat you，write！

Elizabeth Lavenza．

Geneva，March 18th，17—

“Dear，dear Elizabeth！”I exclaimed，when I had read her letter．“I will write instantly and relieve them from the anxiety they must feel．”I wrote，and this exertion greatly fatigued me；but my convalescence had commenced，and proceeded regularly．In another fortnight I was able to leave my chamber．

One of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval to the several professors of the university．In doing this，I underwent a kind of rough usage，ill befitting the wounds that my mind had sustained．Ever since the fatal night，the end of my labours，and the beginning of my misfortunes，I had conceived a violent antipathy even to the name of natural philosophy．When I was otherwise quite restored to health，the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony of my nervous symptoms．Henry saw this and had removed all my apparatus from my view．He had also changed my apartment，for he perceived that I had acquired a dislike for the room which had previously been my laboratory．But these cares of Clerval were made of no avail when I visited the professors．M．Waldman inflicted torture when he praised，with kindness and warmth，the astonishing progress I had made in the sciences．He soon perceived that I disliked the subject，but not guessing the real cause，he attributed my feelings to modesty and changed the subject from my improvement to the science itself，with a desire，as I evidently saw，of drawing me out．What could I do？He meant to please，and he tormented me．I felt as if he had placed carefully，one by one，in my view those instruments which were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death．I writhed under his words yet dared not exhibit the pain I felt．Clerval，whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the sensations of others，declined the subject，alleging，in excuse，his total ignorance；and the conversation took a more general turn．I thanked my friend from my heart，but I did not speak．I saw plainly that he was surprised，but he never attempted to draw my secret from me；and although I loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence that knew no bounds，yet I could never persuade myself to confide to him that event which was so often present to my recollection but which I feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply．

M．Krempe was not equally docile；and in my condition at that time，of almost insupportable sensitiveness，his harsh，blunt encomiums gave me even more pain than the benevolent approbation of M．Waldman．“D—n the fellow！”cried he．“Why，M．Clerval，I assure you he has outstripped us all．Ay，stare if you please；but it is nevertheless true．A youngster who，but a few years ago，believed in Cornelius Agrippa as firmly as in the Gospel，has now set himself at the head of the university；and if he is not soon pulled down，we shall all be out of countenance．Ay，ay，”continued he，observing my face expressive of suffering，“M．Frankenstein is modest，an excellent quality in a young man．Young men should be diffident of themselves，you know，M．Clerval：I was myself when young，but that wears out in a very short time．”

M．Krempe had now commenced a eulogy on himself，which happily turned the conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me．

Clerval had never sympathized in my tastes for natural science，and his literary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me．He came to the university with the design of making himself complete master of the Oriental languages，as thus he should open a field for the plan of life he had marked out for himself．Resolved to pursue no inglorious career，he turned his eyes towards the East，as affording scope for his spirit of enterprise．The Persian，Arabic，and Sanskrit languages engaged his attention，and I was easily induced to enter on the same studies．Idleness had ever been irksome to me，and now that I wished to fly from reflection and hated my former studies，I felt great relief in being the fellow pupil with my friend，and found not only instruction but consolation in the works of the Orientalists．I did not，like him，attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects，for I did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary amusement．I read merely to understand their meaning，and they well repaid my labours．Their melancholy is soothing，and their joy elevating，to a degree I never experienced in studying the authors of any other country．When you read their writings，life appears to consist in a warm sun and a garden of roses，in the smiles and frowns of a fair enemy，and the fire that consumes your own heart．How different from the manly and heroical poetry of Greece and Rome！

Summer passed away in these occupations，and my return to Geneva was fixed for the latter end of autumn；but being delayed by several accidents，winter and snow arrived，the roads were deemed impassable，and my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring．I felt this delay very bitterly，for I longed to see my native town and my beloved friends．My return had only been delayed so long from an unwillingness to leave Clerval in a strange place before he had become acquainted with any of its inhabitants．The winter，however，was spent cheerfully，and although the spring was uncommonly late，when it came its beauty compensated for its dilatoriness．

The month of May had already commenced，and I expected the letter daily which was to fix the date of my departure，when Henry proposed a pedestrian tour in the environs of Ingolstadt，that I might bid a personal farewell to the country I had so long inhabited．I acceded with pleasure to this proposition：I was fond of exercise，and Clerval had always been my favourite companion in the rambles of this nature that I had taken among the scenes of my native country．

We passed a fortnight in these perambulations；my health and spirits had long been restored，and they gained additional strength from the salubrious air I breathed，the natural incidents of our progress，and the conversation of my friend．Study had before secluded me from the intercourse of my fellow creatures and rendered me unsocial，but Clerval called forth the better feelings of my heart；he again taught me to love the aspect of nature and the cheerful faces of children．Excellent friend！How sincerely did you love me and endeavour to elevate my mind until it was on a level with your own！A selfish pursuit had cramped and narrowed me until your gentleness and affection warmed and opened my senses；I became the same happy creature who，a few years ago，loved and beloved by all，had no sorrow or care．When happy，inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most delightful sensations．A serene sky and verdant fields filled me with ecstasy．The present season was indeed divine；the flowers of spring bloomed in the hedges，while those of summer were already in bud．I was undisturbed by thoughts which during the preceding year had pressed upon me，notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off，with an invincible burden．

Henry rejoiced in my gaiety and sincerely sympathised in my feelings；he exerted himself to amuse me，while he expressed the sensations that filled his soul．The resources of his mind on this occasion were truly astonishing；his conversation was full of imagination，and very often，in imitation of the Persian and Arabic writers，he invented tales of wonderful fancy and passion．At other times he repeated my favourite poems or drew me out into arguments，which he supported with great ingenuity．

We returned to our college on a Sunday afternoon；the peasants were dancing，and everyone we met appeared gay and happy．My own spirits were high，and I bounded along with feelings of unbridled joy and hilarity．





Chapter 7


On my return，I found the following letter from my father：

My dear Victor，

You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of your return to us，and I was at first tempted to write only a few lines，merely mentioning the day on which I should expect you．But that would be a cruel kindness，and I dare not do it．What would be your surprise，my son，when you expected a happy and glad welcome，to behold，on the contrary，tears and wretchedness？And how，Victor，can I relate our misfortune？Absence cannot have rendered you callous to our joys and griefs，and how shall I inflict pain on my longabsent son？I wish to prepare you for the woeful news，but I know it is impossible；even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words which are to convey to you the horrible tidings．

William is dead！That sweet child，whose smiles delighted and warmed my heart，who was so gentle，yet so gay！Victor，he is murdered！

I will not attempt to console you，but will simply relate the circumstances of the transaction．

Last Thursday（May 7th）I，my niece，and your two brothers went to walk in Plainpalais．The evening was warm and serene，and we prolonged our walk farther than usual．It was already dusk before we thought of returning，and then we discovered that William and Ernest，who had gone on before，were not to be found．We accordingly rested on a seat until they should return．Presently Ernest came and enquired if we had seen his brother；he said that he had been playing with him，that William had run away to hide himself，and that he vainly sought for him，and afterwards waited for him a long time，but that he did not return．

This account rather alarmed us，and we continued to search for him until night fell，when Elizabeth conjectured that he might have returned to the house．He was not there．We returned again，with torches，for I could not rest when I thought that my sweet boy had lost himself and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night；Elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish．About five in the morning I discovered my lovely boy，whom the night before I had seen blooming and active in health，stretched on the grass livid and motionless；the print of the murderer's finger was on his neck．

He was conveyed home，and the anguish that was visible in my countenance betrayed the secret to Elizabeth．She was very earnest to see the corpse．At first I attempted to prevent her，but she persisted，and entering the room where it lay，hastily examined the neck of the victim，and clasping her hands，exclaimed，“Oh，God！I have murdered my darling child！”

She fainted，and was restored with extreme difficulty．When she again lived，it was only to weep and sigh．She told me that that same evening William had teased her to let him wear a very valuable miniature that she possessed of your mother．This picture is gone and was doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the deed．We have no trace of him at present，although our exertions to discover him are unremitted；but they will not restore my beloved William！

Come，dearest Victor；you alone can console Elizabeth．She weeps continually and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death；her words pierce my heart．We are all unhappy，but will not that be an additional motive for you，my son，to return and be our comforter？Your dear mother！Alas，Victor！I now say，thank God she did not live to witness the cruel，miserable death of her youngest darling！

Come，Victor；not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin，but with feelings of peace and gentleness，that will heal，instead of festering，the wounds of our minds．Enter the house of mourning，my friend，but with kindness and affection for those who love you，and not with hatred for your enemies．

Your affectionate and afflicted father，

Alphonse Frankenstein

Geneva，May 12th，17—．

Clerval，who had watched my countenance as I read this letter，was surprised to observe the despair that succeeded to the joy I at first expressed on receiving news from my friends．I threw the letter on the table and covered my face with my hands．

“My dear Frankenstein，”exclaimed Henry when he perceived me weep with bitterness，“are you always to be unhappy？My dear friend，what has happened？”

I motioned to him to take up the letter，while I walked up and down the room in the extremest agitation．Tears also gushed from the eyes of Clerval as he read the account of my misfortune．

“I can offer you no consolation，my friend，”said he；“your disaster is irreparable．What do you intend to do？”

“To go instantly to Geneva；come with me，Henry，to order the horses．”

During our walk Clerval endeavoured to say a few words of consolation；he could only express his heartfelt sympathy．“Poor William！”said he．“Dear lovely child，he now sleeps with his angel mother！Who that had seen him bright and joyous in his young beauty but must weep over his untimely loss！To die so miserably，to feel the murderer's grasp！How much more a murderer，that could destroy such radiant innocence！Poor little fellow！One only consolation have we；his friends mourn and weep，but he is at rest．The pang is over，his sufferings are at an end forever．A sod covers his gentle form，and he knows no pain．He can no longer be a subject for pity；we must reserve that for his miserable survivors．”

Clerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets；the words impressed themselves on my mind and I remembered them afterwards in solitude But now，as soon as the horses arrived，I hurried into a cabriolet and bade farewell to my friend．

My journey was very melancholy．At first I wished to hurry on，for I longed to console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends；but when I drew near my native town，I slackened my progress．I could hardly sustain the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind．I passed through scenes familiar to my youth but which I had not seen for nearly six years．How altered everything might be during that time！One sudden and desolating change had taken place；but a thousand little circumstances might have by degrees worked other alterations，which，although they were done more tranquilly，might not be the less decisive．Fear overcame me；I dared not advance，dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me tremble，although I was unable to define them．

I remained two days at Lausanne in this painful state of mind．I contemplated the lake；the waters were placid，all around was calm，and the snowy mountains，“the palaces of nature，”were not changed．By degrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me，and I continued my journey towards Geneva．

The road ran by the side of the lake，which became narrower as I approached my native town．I discovered more distinctly the black sides of Jura and the bright summit of Mont Blanc．I wept like a child．“Dear mountains！My own beautiful lake！How do you welcome your wanderer？Your summits are clear；the sky and lake are blue and placid．Is this to prognosticate peace or to mock at my unhappiness？”

I fear，my friend，that I shall render myself tedious by dwelling on these preliminary circumstances，but they were days of comparative happiness，and I think of them with pleasure．My country，my beloved country！Who but a native can tell the delight I took in again beholding thy streams，thy mountains，and more than all，thy lovely lake！

Yet，as I drew nearer home，grief and fear again overcame me．Night also closed around，and when I could hardly see the dark mountains，I felt still more gloomily．The picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil，and I foresaw obscurely that I was destined to become the most wretched of human beings．Alas！I prophesied truly，and failed only in one single circumstance，that in all the misery I imagined and dreaded，I did not conceive the hundredth part of the anguish I was destined to endure．

It was completely dark when I arrived in the environs of Geneva；the gates of the town were already shut，and I was obliged to pass the night at Secheron，a village at the distance of half a league from the city．The sky was serene，and as I was unable to rest，I resolved to visit the spot where my poor William had been murdered．As I could not pass through the town，I was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at Plainpalais．During this short voyage I saw the lightnings playing on the summit of Mont Blanc in the most beautiful figures．The storm appeared to approach rapidly；and，on landing，I ascended a low hill，that I might observe its progress．It advanced；the heavens were clouded，and I soon felt the rain coming slowly in large drops，but its violence quickly increased．

I quitted my seat and walked on，although the darkness and storm increased every minute and the thunder burst with a terrific crash over my head．It was echoed from Salêve，the Juras，and the Alps of Savoy；vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes，illuminating the lake，making it appear like a vast sheet of fire；then for an instant everything seemed of a pitchy darkness，until the eye recovered itself from the preceding flash．The storm，as is often the case in Switzerland，appeared at once in various parts of the heavens．The most violent storm hung exactly north of the town，over the part of the lake which lies between the promontory of Belrive and the village of Copêt．Another storm enlightened Jura with faint flashes，and another darkened and sometimes disclosed the Môle，a peaked mountain to the east of the lake．

While I watched the tempest，so beautiful yet terrific，I wandered on with a hasty step．This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits；I clasped my hands and exclaimed aloud，“William，dear angel！This is thy funeral，this thy dirge！”As I said these words，I perceived in the gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me；I stood fixed，gazing intently；I could not be mistaken．A flash of lightning illuminated the object and discovered its shape plainly to me；its gigantic stature，and the deformity of its aspect，more hideous than belongs to humanity，instantly informed me that it was the wretch，the filthy demon to whom I had given life．What did he there？Could he be（I shuddered at the conception）the murderer of my brother？No sooner did that idea cross my imagination than I became convinced of its truth；my teeth chattered，and I was forced to lean against a tree for support．The figure passed me quickly，and I lost it in the gloom．Nothing in human shape could have destroyed that fair child．He was the murderer！I could not doubt it．The mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the fact．I thought of pursuing the devil，but it would have been in vain，for another flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly perpendicular ascent of Mont Salêve，a hill that bounds Plainpalais on the south．He soon reached the summit and disappeared．

I remained motionless．The thunder ceased，but the rain still continued，and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness．I revolved in my mind the events which I had until now sought to forget：the whole train of my progress towards the creation，the appearance of the work of my own hands alive at my bedside，its departure．Two years had now nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life，and was this his first crime？Alas！I had turned loose into the world a depraved wretch whose delight was in carnage and misery；had he not murdered my brother？

No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the night，which I spent，cold and wet，in the open air．But I did not feel the inconvenience of the weather；my imagination was busy in scenes of evil and despair．I considered the being whom I had cast among mankind and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes of horror，such as the deed which he had now done，nearly in the light of my own vampire，my own spirit let loose from the grave and forced to destroy all that was dear to me．

Day dawned，and I directed my steps towards the town．The gates were open，and I hastened to my father's house．My first thought was to discover what I knew of the murderer and cause instant pursuit to be made．But I paused when I reflected on the story that I had to tell．A being whom I myself had formed，and endued with life，had met me at midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain．I remembered also the nervous fever with which I had been seized just at the time that I dated my creation，and which would give an air of delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable．I well knew that if any other had communicated such a relation to me，I should have looked upon it as the ravings of insanity．Besides，the strange nature of the animal would elude all pursuit，even if I were so far credited as to persuade my relatives to commence it．And then of what use would be pursuit？Who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the overhanging sides of Mont Salêve？These reflections determined me，and I resolved to remain silent．

It was about five in the morning when I entered my father's house．I told the servants not to disturb the family and went into the library to attend their usual hour of rising．

Six years had elapsed，passed as a dream but for one indelible trace，and I stood in the same place where I had last embraced my father before my departure for Ingolstadt．Beloved and venerable parent！He still remained to me．I gazed on the picture of my mother which stood over the mantelpiece．It was a historical subject，painted at my father's desire，and represented Caroline Beaufort in an agony of despair，kneeling by the coffin of her dead father．Her garb was rustic and her cheek pale，but there was an air of dignity and beauty that hardly permitted the sentiment of pity．Below this picture was a miniature of William，and my tears flowed when I looked upon it．While I was thus engaged，Ernest entered；he had heard me arrive and hastened to welcome me．He expressed a sorrowful delight to see me．“Welcome，my dearest Victor，”said he．“Ah！I wish you had come three months ago，and then you would have found us all joyous and delighted．You come to us now to share a misery which nothing can alleviate；yet your presence will，I hope，revive our father，who seems sinking under his misfortune；and your persuasions will induce poor Elizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting self-accusations．Poor William！He was our darling and our pride！”

Tears，unrestrained，fell from my brother's eyes；a sense of mortal agony crept over my frame．Before，I had only imagined the wretchedness of my desolated home；the reality came on me as a new and a not less terrible disaster．I tried to calm Ernest；I enquired more minutely concerning my father and here I named my cousin．

“She most of all，”said Ernest，“requires consolation；she accused herself of having caused the death of my brother，and that made her very wretched．But since the murderer has been discovered—”

“The murderer discovered！Good God！how can that be？Who could attempt to pursue him？It is impossible；one might as well try to overtake the winds or confine a mountain stream with a straw．I saw him too；he was free last night！”

“I do not know what you mean，”replied my brother in accents of wonder，“but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery．No one would believe it at first；and even now Elizabeth will not be convinced，notwithstanding all the evidence．Indeed，who would credit that Justine Moritz，who was so amiable and fond of all the family，could suddenly become capable of so frightful，so appalling a crime？”

“Justine Moritz！Poor，poor girl，is she the accused？But it is wrongfully；everyone knows that；no one believes it，surely，Ernest？”

“No one did at first，but several circumstances came out that have almost forced conviction upon us；and her own behaviour has been so confused as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that，I fear，leaves no hope for doubt．But she will be tried today，and you will then hear all．”

He related that，the morning on which the murder of poor William had been discovered，Justine had been taken ill and confined to her bed for several days．During this interval one of the servants，happening to examine the apparel she had worn on the night of the murder，had discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother，which had been judged to be the temptation of the murderer．The servant instantly showed it to one of the others，who，without saying a word to any of the family，went to a magistrate；and，upon their deposition，Justine was apprehended．On being charged with the fact，the poor girl confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of manner．

This was a strange tale，but it did not shake my faith，and I replied earnestly，“You are all mistaken；I know the murderer．Justine，poor，good Justine，is innocent．”

At that instant my father entered．I saw unhappiness deeply impressed on his countenance，but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully，and，after we had exchanged our mournful greeting，would have introduced some other topic than that of our disaster，had not Ernest exclaimed，“Good God，papa！Victor says that he knows who was the murderer of poor William．”

“We do also，unfortunately，”replied my father；“for indeed I had rather have been forever ignorant than have discovered so much depravity and ingratitude in one I valued so highly．”

“My dear father，you are mistaken；Justine is innocent．”

“If she is，God forbid that she should suffer as guilty．She is to be tried today，and I hope，I sincerely hope，that she will be acquitted．”

This speech calmed me．I was firmly convinced in my own mind that Justine，and indeed every human being，was guiltless of this murder．I had no fear，therefore，that any circumstantial evidence could be brought forward strong enough to convict her．My tale was not one to announce publicly；its astounding horror would be looked upon as madness by the vulgar．Did anyone indeed exist，except I，the creator，who would believe，unless his senses convinced him，in the existence of the living monument of presumption and rash ignorance which I had let loose upon the world？

We were soon joined by Elizabeth．Time had altered her since I last beheld her；it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of her childish years．There was the same candour，the same vivacity，but it was allied to an expression more full of sensibility and intellect．She welcomed me with the greatest affection．“Your arrival，my dear cousin，”said she，“fills me with hope．You perhaps will find some means to justify my poor guiltless Justine．Alas！Who is safe，if she be convicted of crime？I rely on her innocence as certainly as I do upon my own．Our misfortune is doubly hard to us；we have not only lost that lovely darling boy，but this poor girl，whom I sincerely love，is to be torn away by even a worse fate．If she is condemned，I never shall know joy more．But she will not，I am sure she will not；and then I shall be happy again，even after the sad death of my little William．”

“She is innocent，my Elizabeth，”said I，“and that shall be proved；fear nothing，but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance of her acquittal．”

“How kind and generous you are！everyone else believes in her guilt，and that made me wretched，for I knew that it was impossible；and to see everyone else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me hopeless and despairing．”She wept．

“Dearest niece，”said my father，“dry your tears．If she is，as you believe，innocent，rely on the justice of our laws，and the activity with which I shall prevent the slightest shadow of partiality．”





Chapter 8


We passed a few sad hours until eleven o'clock，when the trial was to commence．My father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend as witnesses，I accompanied them to the court．During the whole of this wretched mockery of justice I suffered living torture．It was to be decided whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would cause the death of two of my fellow beings：one a smiling babe full of innocence and joy，the other far more dreadfully murdered，with every aggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror．Justine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promised to render her life happy；now all was to be obliterated in an ignominious grave，and I the cause！A thousand times rather would I have confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to Justine，but I was absent when it was committed，and such a declaration would have been considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have exculpated her who suffered through me．

The appearance of Justine was calm．She was dressed in mourning，and her countenance，always engaging，was rendered，by the solemnity of her feelings，exquisitely beautiful．Yet she appeared confident in innocence and did not tremble，although gazed on and execrated by thousands，for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have excited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the imagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed．She was tranquil，yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained；and as her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt，she worked up her mind to an appearance of courage．When she entered the court she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were seated．A tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us，but she quickly recovered herself，and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest her utter guiltlessness．

The trial began，and after the advocate against her had stated the charge，several witnesses were called．Several strange facts combined against her，which might have staggered anyone who had not such proof of her innocence as I had．She had been out the whole of the night on which the murder had been committed and towards morning had been perceived by a market-woman not far from the spot where the body of the murdered child had been afterwards found．The woman asked her what she did there，but she looked very strangely and only returned a confused and unintelligible answer．She returned to the house about eight o'clock，and when one inquired where she had passed the night，she replied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly if anything had been heard concerning him．When shown the body，she fell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days．The picture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket；and when Elizabeth，in a faltering voice，proved that it was the same which，an hour before the child had been missed，she had placed round his neck，a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court．

Justine was called on for her defence．As the trial had proceeded，her countenance had altered．Surprise，horror，and misery were strongly expressed．Sometimes she struggled with her tears，but when she was desired to plead，she collected her powers and spoke in an audible although variable voice．

“God knows，”she said，“how entirely I am innocent．But I do not pretend that my protestations should acquit me；I rest my innocence on a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced against me，and I hope the character I have always borne will incline my judges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance appears doubtful or suspicious．”

She then related that，by the permission of Elizabeth，she had passed the evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the house of an aunt at Chêne，a village situated at about a league from Geneva．On her return，at about nine o'clock，she met a man who asked her if she had seen anything of the child who was lost．She was alarmed by this account and passed several hours in looking for him，when the gates of Geneva were shut，and she was forced to remain several hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage，being unwilling to call up the inhabitants，to whom she was well known．Most of the night she spent here watching；towards morning she believed that she slept for a few minutes；some steps disturbed her，and she awoke．It was dawn，and she quitted her asylum，that she might again endeavour to find my brother．If she had gone near the spot where his body lay，it was without her knowledge．That she had been bewildered when questioned by the market-woman was not surprising，since she had passed a sleepless night and the fate of poor William was yet uncertain．Concerning the picture she could give no account．

“I know，”continued the unhappy victim，“how heavily and fatally this one circumstance weighs against me，but I have no power of explaining it；and when I have expressed my utter ignorance，I am only left to conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been placed in my pocket．But here also I am checked．I believe that I have no enemy on earth，and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me wantonly．Did the murderer place it there？I know of no opportunity afforded him for so doing；or，if I had，why should he have stolen the jewel，to part with it again so soon？

“I commit my cause to the justice of my judges，yet I see no room for hope．I beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my character，and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed guilt，I must be condemned，although I would pledge my salvation on my innocence．”

Several witnesses were called who had known her for many years，and they spoke well of her；but fear and hatred of the crime of which they supposed her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling to come forward．Elizabeth saw even this last resource，her excellent dispositions and irreproachable conduct，about to fail the accused，when，although violently agitated，she desired permission to address the court．

“I am，”said she，“the cousin of the unhappy child who was murdered，or rather his sister，for I was educated by and have lived with his parents ever since and even long before his birth．It may therefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion，but when I see a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of her pretended friends，I wish to be allowed to speak，that I may say what I know of her character．I am well acquainted with the accused．I have lived in the same house with her，at one time for five and at another for nearly two years．During all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and benevolent of human creatures．She nursed Madame Frankenstein，my aunt，in her last illness，with the greatest affection and care and afterwards attended her own mother during a tedious illness，in a manner that excited the admiration of all who knew her，after which she again lived in my uncle's house，where she was beloved by all the family．She was warmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a most affectionate mother．For my own part，I do not hesitate to say that，notwithstanding all the evidence produced against her，I believe and rely on her perfect innocence．She had no temptation for such an action；as to the bauble on which the chief proof rests，if she had earnestly desired it，I should have willingly given it to her，so much do I esteem and value her．”

A murmur of approbation followed Elizabeth's simple and powerful appeal，but it was excited by her generous interference，and not in favour of poor Justine，on whom the public indignation was turned with renewed violence，charging her with the blackest ingratitude．She herself wept as Elizabeth spoke，but she did not answer．My own agitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial．I believed in her innocence；I knew it．Could the demon who had（I did not for a minute doubt）murdered my brother also in his hellish sport have betrayed the innocent to death and ignominy？I could not sustain the horror of my situation，and when I perceived that the popular voice and the countenances of the judges had already condemned my unhappy victim，I rushed out of the court in agony．The tortures of the accused did not equal mine；she was sustained by innocence，but the fangs of remorse tore my bosom and would not forgo their hold．

I passed a night of unmingled wretchedness．In the morning I went to the court；my lips and throat were parched．I dared not ask the fatal question，but I was known，and the officer guessed the cause of my visit．The ballots had been thrown；they were all black，and Justine was condemned．

I cannot pretend to describe what I then felt．I had before experienced sensations of horror，and I have endeavoured to bestow upon them adequate expressions，but words cannot convey an idea of the heart-sickening despair that I then endured．The person to whom I addressed myself added that Justine had already confessed her guilt．“That evidence，”he observed，“was hardly required in so glaring a case，but I am glad of it；and，indeed，none of our judges like to condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence，be it ever so decisive．”

This was strange and unexpected intelligence；what could it mean？Had my eyes deceived me？And was I really as mad as the whole world would believe me to be if I disclosed the object of my suspicions？I hastened to return home，and Elizabeth eagerly demanded the result．

“My cousin，”replied I，“it is decided as you may have expected；all judges had rather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guilty should escape．But she has confessed．”

This was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth，who had relied with firmness upon Justine's innocence．“Alas！”said she．“How shall I ever again believe in human goodness？Justine，whom I loved and esteemed as my sister，how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray？Her mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or guile，and yet she has committed a murder．”

Soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see my cousin．My father wished her not to go but said that he left it to her own judgment and feelings to decide．“Yes，”said Elizabeth，“I will go，although she is guilty；and you，Victor，shall accompany me；I cannot go alone．”The idea of this visit was torture to me，yet I could not refuse．

We entered the gloomy prison chamber and beheld Justine sitting on some straw at the farther end；her hands were manacled，and her head rested on her knees．She rose on seeing us enter，and when we were left alone with her，she threw herself at the feet of Elizabeth，weeping bitterly．My cousin wept also．

“Oh，Justine！”said she．“Why did you rob me of my last consolation？I relied on your innocence，and although I was then very wretched，I was not so miserable as I am now．”

“And do you also believe that I am so very，very wicked？Do you also join with my enemies to crush me，to condemn me as a murderer？”Her voice was suffocated with sobs．

“Rise，my poor girl，”said Elizabeth；“why do you kneel，if you are innocent？I am not one of your enemies；I believed you guiltless，notwithstanding every evidence，until I heard that you had yourself declared your guilt．That report，you say，is false；and be assured，dear Justine，that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a moment，but your own confession．”

“I did confess，but I confessed a lie．I confessed，that I might obtain absolution；but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than all my other sins．The God of heaven forgive me！Ever since I was condemned，my confessor has besieged me；he threatened and menaced，until I almost began to think that I was the monster that he said I was．He threatened excommunication and hell fire in my last moments if I continued obdurate．Dear lady，I had none to support me；all looked on me as a wretch doomed to ignominy and perdition．What could I do？In an evil hour I subscribed to a lie；and now only am I truly miserable．”

She paused，weeping，and then continued，“I thought with horror，my sweet lady，that you should believe your Justine，whom your blessed aunt had so highly honoured and whom you loved，was a creature capable of a crime which none but the devil himself could have perpetrated．Dear William！Dearest blessed child！I soon shall see you again in heaven，where we shall all be happy；and that consoles me，going as I am to suffer ignominy and death．”

“Oh，Justine！Forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you．Why did you confess？But do not mourn，dear girl．Do not fear．I will proclaim，I will prove your innocence．I will melt the stony hearts of your enemies by my tears and prayers．You shall not die！You，my playfellow，my companion，my sister，perish on the scaffold！No！No！I never could survive so horrible a misfortune．”

Justine shook her head mournfully．“I do not fear to die，”she said；“that pang is past．God raises my weakness and gives me courage to endure the worst．I leave a sad and bitter world；and if you remember me and think of me as of one unjustly condemned，I am resigned to the fate awaiting me．Learn from me，dear lady，to submit in patience to the will of heaven！”

During this conversation I had retired to a corner of the prison room，where I could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me．Despair！Who dared talk of that？The poor victim，who on the morrow was to pass the awful boundary between life and death，felt not，as I did，such deep and bitter agony．I gnashed my teeth and ground them together，uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul．Justine started．When she saw who it was，she approached me and said，“Dear sir，you are very kind to visit me；you，I hope，do not believe that I am guilty？”

I could not answer．“No，Justine，”said Elizabeth；“he is more convinced of your innocence than I was，for even when he heard that you had confessed，he did not credit it．”

“I truly thank him．In these last moments I feel the sincerest gratitude towards those who think of me with kindness．How sweet is the affection of others to such a wretch as I am！It removes more than half my misfortune，and I feel as if I could die in peace now that my innocence is acknowledged by you，dear lady，and your cousin．”

Thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself．She indeed gained the resignation she desired．But I，the true murderer，felt the never-dying worm alive in my bosom，which allowed of no hope or consolation．Elizabeth also wept and was unhappy，but hers also was the misery of innocence，which，like a cloud that passes over the fair moon，for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness．Anguish and despair had penetrated into the core of my heart；I bore a hell within me which nothing could extinguish．We stayed several hours with Justine，and it was with great difficulty that Elizabeth could tear herself away．“I wish，”cried she，“that I were to die with you；I cannot live in this world of misery．”

Justine assumed an air of cheerfulness，while she with difficulty repressed her bitter tears．She embraced Elizabeth and said in a voice of half-suppressed emotion，“Farewell，sweet lady，dearest Elizabeth，my beloved and only friend；may heaven，in its bounty，bless and preserve you；may this be the last misfortune that you will ever suffer！Live，and be happy，and make others so．”

And on the morrow Justine died．Elizabeth's heart-rending eloquence failed to move the judges from their settled conviction in the criminality of the saintly sufferer．My passionate and indignant appeals were lost upon them．And when I received their cold answers and heard the harsh，unfeeling reasoning of these men，my purposed avowal died away on my lips．Thus I might proclaim myself a madman，but not revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim．She perished on the scaffold as a murderess！

From the tortures of my own heart，I turned to contemplate the deep and voiceless grief of my Elizabeth．This also was my doing！And my father's woe，and the desolation of that late so smiling home—all was the work of my thrice-accursed hands！Ye weep，unhappy ones，but these are not your last tears！Again shall you raise the funeral wail，and the sound of your lamentations shall again and again be heard！Frankenstein，your son，your kinsman，your early，much-loved friend；he who would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes，who has no thought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dear countenances，who would fill the air with blessings and spend his life in serving you—he bids you weep，to shed countless tears；happy beyond his hopes，if thus inexorable fate be satisfied，and if the destruction pause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments！

Thus spoke my prophetic soul，as，torn by remorse，horror，and despair，I beheld those I loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of William and Justine，the first hapless victims to my unhallowed arts．





Chapter 9


Nothing is more painful to the human mind than，after the feelings have been worked up by a quick succession of events，the dead calmness of inaction and certainty which follows and deprives the soul both of hope and fear．Justine died，she rested，and I was alive．The blood flowed freely in my veins，but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my heart which nothing could remove．Sleep fled from my eyes；I wandered like an evil spirit，for I had committed deeds of mischief beyond description horrible，and more，much more（I persuaded myself）was yet behind．Yet my heart overflowed with kindness and the love of virtue．I had begun life with benevolent intentions and thirsted for the moment when I should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellow beings．Now all was blasted；instead of that serenity of conscience which allowed me to look back upon the past with self-satisfaction，and from thence to gather promise of new hopes，I was seized by remorse and the sense of guilt，which hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures such as no language can describe．

This state of mind preyed upon my health，which had perhaps never entirely recovered from the first shock it had sustained．I shunned the face of man；all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me；solitude was my only consolation—deep，dark，deathlike solitude．

My father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my disposition and habits and endeavoured by arguments deduced from the feelings of his serene conscience and guiltless life to inspire me with fortitude and awaken in me the courage to dispel the dark cloud which brooded over me．“Do you think，Victor，”said he，“that I do not suffer also？No one could love a child more than I loved your brother”—tears came into his eyes as he spoke—”but is it not a duty to the survivors that we should refrain from augmenting their unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief？It is also a duty owed to yourself，for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment，or even the discharge of daily usefulness，without which no man is fit for society．”

This advice，although good，was totally inapplicable to my case；I should have been the first to hide my grief and console my friends if remorse had not mingled its bitterness，and terror its alarm，with my other sensations．Now I could only answer my father with a look of despair and endeavour to hide myself from his view．

About this time we retired to our house at Belrive．This change was particularly agreeable to me．The shutting of the gates regularly at ten o'clock and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that hour had rendered our residence within the walls of Geneva very irksome to me．I was now free．Often，after the rest of the family had retired for the night，I took the boat and passed many hours upon the water．Sometimes，with my sails set，I was carried by the wind；and sometimes，after rowing into the middle of the lake，I left the boat to pursue its own course and gave way to my own miserable reflections．I was often tempted，when all was at peace around me，and I the only unquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and heavenly—if I except some bat，or the frogs，whose harsh and interrupted croaking was heard only when I approached the shore—often，I say，I was tempted to plunge into the silent lake，that the waters might close over me and my calamities forever．But I was restrained，when I thought of the heroic and suffering Elizabeth，whom I tenderly loved，and whose existence was bound up in mine．I thought also of my father and surviving brother；should I by my base desertion leave them exposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom I had let loose among them？

At these moments I wept bitterly and wished that peace would revisit my mind only that I might afford them consolation and happiness．But that could not be．Remorse extinguished every hope．I had been the author of unalterable evils，and I lived in daily fear lest the monster whom I had created should perpetrate some new wickedness．I had an obscure feeling that all was not over and that he would still commit some signal crime，which by its enormity should almost efface the recollection of the past．There was always scope for fear so long as anything I loved remained behind．My abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived．When I thought of him I gnashed my teeth，my eyes became inflamed，and I ardently wished to extinguish that life which I had so thoughtlessly bestowed．When I reflected on his crimes and malice，my hatred and revenge burst all bounds of moderation．I would have made a pilgrimage to the highest peak of the Andes，could I when there have precipitated him to their base．I wished to see him again，that I might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on his head and avenge the deaths of William and Justine．

Our house was the house of mourning．My father's health was deeply shaken by the horror of the recent events．Elizabeth was sad and desponding；she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations；all pleasure seemed to her sacrilege towards the dead；eternal woe and tears she then thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blasted and destroyed．She was no longer that happy creature who in earlier youth wandered with me on the banks of the lake and talked with ecstasy of our future prospects．The first of those sorrows which are sent to wean us from the earth had visited her，and its dimming influence quenched her dearest smiles．

“When I reflect，my dear cousin，”said she，“on the miserable death of Justine Moritz，I no longer see the world and its works as they before appeared to me．Before，I looked upon the accounts of vice and injustice that I read in books or heard from others as tales of ancient days or imaginary evils；at least they were remote and more familiar to reason than to the imagination；but now misery has come home，and men appear to me as monsters thirsting for each other's blood．Yet I am certainly unjust．Everybody believed that poor girl to be guilty，and if she could have committed the crime for which she suffered，assuredly she would have been the most depraved of human creatures．For the sake of a few jewels，to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend，a child whom she had nursed from its birth，and appeared to love as if it had been her own！I could not consent to the death of any human being，but certainly I should have thought such a creature unfit to remain in the society of men．But she was innocent．I know，I feel，she was innocent；you are of the same opinion，and that confirms me．Alas！Victor，when falsehood can look so like the truth，who can assure themselves of certain happiness？I feel as if I were walking on the edge of a precipice，towards which thousands are crowding and endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss．William and Justine were assassinated，and the murderer escapes；he walks about the world free，and perhaps respected．But even if I were condemned to suffer on the scaffold for the same crimes，I would not change places with such a wretch．”

I listened to this discourse with the extremest agony．I，not in deed，but in effect，was the true murderer．Elizabeth read my anguish in my countenance，and kindly taking my hand，said，“My dearest friend，you must calm yourself．These events have affected me，God knows how deeply；but I am not so wretched as you are．There is an expression of despair，and sometimes of revenge，in your countenance that makes me tremble．Dear Victor，banish these dark passions．Remember the friends around you，who centre all their hopes in you．Have we lost the power of rendering you happy？Ah！While we love，while we are true to each other，here in this land of peace and beauty，your native country，we may reap every tranquil blessing—what can disturb our peace？”

And could not such words from her whom I fondly prized before every other gift of fortune suffice to chase away the fiend that lurked in my heart？Even as she spoke I drew near to her，as if in terror，lest at that very moment the destroyer had been near to rob me of her．

Thus not the tenderness of friendship，nor the beauty of earth，nor of heaven，could redeem my soul from woe；the very accents of love were ineffectual．I was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial influence could penetrate．The wounded deer dragging its fainting limbs to some untrodden brake，there to gaze upon the arrow which had pierced it，and to die，was but a type of me．

Sometimes I could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me，but sometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to seek，by bodily exercise and by change of place，some relief from my intolerable sensations．It was during an access of this kind that I suddenly left my home，and bending my steps towards the near Alpine valleys，sought in the magnificence，the eternity of such scenes，to forget myself and my ephemeral，because human，sorrows．My wanderings were directed towards the valley of Chamounix．I had visited it frequently during my boyhood．Six years had passed since then：I was a wreck，but nought had changed in those savage and enduring scenes．

I performed the first part of my journey on horseback．I afterwards hired a mule，as the more sure-footed and least liable to receive injury on these rugged roads．The weather was fine；it was about the middle of the month of August，nearly two months after the death of Justine，that miserable epoch from which I dated all my woe．The weight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as I plunged yet deeper in the ravine of Arve．The immense mountains and precipices that overhung me on every side，the sound of the river raging among the rocks，and the dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as Omnipotence—and I ceased to fear or to bend before any being less almighty than that which had created and ruled the elements，here displayed in their most terrific guise．Still，as I ascended higher，the valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character．Ruined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains，the impetuous Arve，and cottages every here and there peeping forth from among the trees formed a scene of singular beauty．But it was augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty Alps，whose white and shining pyramids and domes towered above all，as belonging to another earth，the habitations of another race of beings．

I passed the bridge of Pelissier，where the ravine，which the river forms，opened before me，and I began to ascend the mountain that overhangs it．Soon after，I entered the valley of Chamounix．This valley is more wonderful and sublime，but not so beautiful and picturesque as that of Servox，through which I had just passed．The high and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries，but I saw no more ruined castles and fertile fields．Immense glaciers approached the road；I heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche and marked the smoke of its passage．Mont Blanc，the supreme and magnificent Mont Blanc，raised itself from the surrounding aiguilles，and its tremendous dome overlooked the valley．

A tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during this journey．Some turn in the road，some new object suddenly perceived and recognized，reminded me of days gone by，and were associated with the light-hearted gaiety of boyhood．The very winds whispered in soothing accents，and maternal Nature bade me weep no more．Then again the kindly influence ceased to act—I found myself fettered again to grief and indulging in all the misery of reflection．Then I spurred on my animal，striving so to forget the world，my fears，and more than all，myself—or，in a more desperate fashion，I alighted and threw myself on the grass，weighed down by horror and despair．

At length I arrived at the village of Chamounix．Exhaustion succeeded to the extreme fatigue both of body and of mind which I had endured．For a short space of time I remained at the window watching the pallid lightnings that played above Mont Blanc and listening to the rushing of the Arve，which pursued its noisy way beneath．The same lulling sounds acted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations；when I placed my head upon my pillow，sleep crept over me；I felt it as it came and blessed the giver of oblivion．





Chapter 10


I spent the following day roaming through the valley．I stood beside the sources of the Arveiron，which take their rise in a glacier，that with slow pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills to barricade the valley．The abrupt sides of vast mountains were before me；the icy wall of the glacier overhung me；a few shattered pines were scattered around；and the solemn silence of this glorious presence-chamber of imperial nature was broken only by the brawling waves or the fall of some vast fragment，the thunder sound of the avalanche or the cracking，reverberated along the mountains，of the accumulated ice，which，through the silent working of immutable laws，was ever and anon rent and torn，as if it had been but a plaything in their hands．These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the greatest consolation that I was capable of receiving．They elevated me from all littleness of feeling，and although they did not remove my grief，they subdued and tranquillized it．In some degree，also，they diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the last month．I retired to rest at night；my slumbers，as it were，waited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which I had contemplated during the day．They congregated round me；the unstained snowy mountaintop，the glittering pinnacle，the pine woods，and ragged bare ravine，the eagle，soaring amidst the clouds—they all gathered round me and bade me be at peace．

Where had they fled when the next morning I awoke？All of soul-inspiriting fled with sleep，and dark melancholy clouded every thought．The rain was pouring in torrents，and thick mists hid the summits of the mountains，so that I even saw not the faces of those mighty friends．Still I would penetrate their misty veil and seek them in their cloudy retreats．What were rain and storm to me？My mule was brought to the door，and I resolved to ascend to the summit of Montanvert．I remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous and evermoving glacier had produced upon my mind when I first saw it．It had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the soul and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy．The sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the effect of solemnizing my mind and causing me to forget the passing cares of life．I determined to go without a guide，for I was well acquainted with the path，and the presence of another would destroy the solitary grandeur of the scene．

The ascent is precipitous，but the path is cut into continual and short windings，which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the mountain．It is a scene terrifically desolate．In a thousand spots the traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived，where trees lie broken and strewed on the ground，some entirely destroyed，others bent，leaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely upon other trees．The path，as you ascend higher，is intersected by ravines of snow，down which stones continually roll from above；one of them is particularly dangerous，as the slightest sound，such as even speaking in a loud voice，produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw destruction upon the head of the speaker．The pines are not tall or luxuriant，but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene．I looked on the valley beneath；vast mists were rising from the rivers which ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite mountains，whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds，while rain poured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impression I received from the objects around me．Alas！Why does man boast of sensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute；it only renders them more necessary beings．If our impulses were confined to hunger，thirst，and desire，we might be nearly free；but now we are moved by every wind that blows and a chance word or scene that that word may convey to us．

We rest；a dream has power to poison sleep．

We rise；one wand'ring thought pollutes the day．

We feel，conceive，or reason；laugh or weep，

Embrace fond woe，or cast our cares away；

It is the same：for，be it joy or sorrow，

The path of its departure still is free．

Man's yesterday may ne'er be like his morrow；

Nought may endure but mutability！

It was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the ascent．For some time I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice．A mist covered both that and the surrounding mountains．Presently a breeze dissipated the cloud，and I descended upon the glacier．The surface is very uneven，rising like the waves of a troubled sea，descending low，and interspersed by rifts that sink deep．The field of ice is almost a league in width，but I spent nearly two hours in crossing it．The opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock．From the side where I now stood Montanvert was exactly opposite，at the distance of a league；and above it rose Mont Blanc，in awful majesty．I remained in a recess of the rock，gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene．The sea，or rather the vast river of ice，wound among its dependent mountains，whose aerial summits hung over its recesses．Their icy and glittering peaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds．My heart，which was before sorrowful，now swelled with something like joy；I exclaimed，“Wandering spirits，if indeed ye wander，and do not rest in your narrow beds，allow me this faint happiness，or take me，as your companion，away from the joys of life．”

As I said this I suddenly beheld the figure of a man，at some distance，advancing towards me with superhuman speed．He bounded over the crevices in the ice，among which I had walked with caution；his stature，also，as he approached，seemed to exceed that of man．I was troubled；a mist came over my eyes，and I felt a faintness seize me；but I was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains．I perceived，as the shape came nearer（sight tremendous and abhorred！）that it was the wretch whom I had created．I trembled with rage and horror，resolving to wait his approach and then close with him in mortal combat．He approached；his countenance bespoke bitter anguish，combined with disdain and malignity，while its unearthly ugliness rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes．But I scarcely observed this；rage and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance，and I recovered only to overwhelm him with words expressive of furious detestation and contempt．

“Devil，”I exclaimed，“do you dare approach me？And do not you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head？Begone，vile insect！Or rather，stay，that I may trample you to dust！And，oh！That I could，with the extinction of your miserable existence，restore those victims whom you have so diabolically murdered！”

“I expected this reception，”said the demon．“All men hate the wretched；how，then，must I be hated，who am miserable beyond all living things！Yet you，my creator，detest and spurn me，thy creature，to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of one of us．You purpose to kill me．How dare you sport thus with life？Do your duty towards me，and I will do mine towards you and the rest of mankind．If you will comply with my conditions，I will leave them and you at peace；but if you refuse，I will glut the maw of death，until it be satiated with the blood of your remaining friends．”

“Abhorred monster！Fiend that thou art！The tortures of hell are too mild a vengeance for thy crimes．Wretched devil！You reproach me with your creation；come on，then，that I may extinguish the spark which I so negligently bestowed．”

My rage was without bounds；I sprang on him，impelled by all the feelings which can arm one being against the existence of another．

He easily eluded me and said，“Be calm！I entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your hatred on my devoted head．Have I not suffered enough，that you seek to increase my misery？Life，although it may only be an accumulation of anguish，is dear to me，and I will defend it．Remember，thou hast made me more powerful than thyself；my height is superior to thine，my joints more supple．But I will not be tempted to set myself in opposition to thee．I am thy creature，and I will be even mild and docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part，the which thou owest me．Oh，Frankenstein，be not equitable to every other and trample upon me alone，to whom thy justice，and even thy clemency and affection，is most due．Remember that I am thy creature；I ought to be thy Adam，but I am rather the fallen angel，whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed．Everywhere I see bliss，from which I alone am irrevocably excluded．I was benevolent and good；misery made me a fiend．Make me happy，and I shall again be virtuous．”

“Begone！I will not hear you．There can be no community between you and me；we are enemies．Begone，or let us try our strength in a fight，in which one must fall．”

“How can I move thee？Will no entreaties cause thee to turn a favourable eye upon thy creature，who implores thy goodness and compassion？Believe me，Frankenstein，I was benevolent；my soul glowed with love and humanity；but am I not alone，miserably alone？You，my creator，abhor me；what hope can I gather from your fellow creatures，who owe me nothing？They spurn and hate me．The desert mountains and dreary glaciers are my refuge．I have wandered here many days；the caves of ice，which I only do not fear，are a dwelling to me，and the only one which man does not grudge．These bleak skies I hail，for they are kinder to me than your fellow beings．If the multitude of mankind knew of my existence，they would do as you do，and arm themselves for my destruction．Shall I not then hate them who abhor me？I will keep no terms with my enemies．I am miserable，and they shall share my wretchedness．Yet it is in your power to recompense me，and deliver them from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great，that not only you and your family，but thousands of others，shall be swallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage．Let your compassion be moved，and do not disdain me．Listen to my tale；when you have heard that，abandon or commiserate me，as you shall judge that I deserve．But hear me．The guilty are allowed，by human laws，bloody as they are，to speak in their own defence before they are condemned．Listen to me，Frankenstein．You accuse me of murder，and yet you would，with a satisfied conscience，destroy your own creature．Oh，praise the eternal justice of man！Yet I ask you not to spare me；listen to me，and then，if you can，and if you will，destroy the work of your hands．”

“Why do you call to my remembrance，”I rejoined，“circumstances of which I shudder to reflect，that I have been the miserable origin and author？Cursed be the day，abhorred devil，in which you first saw light！Cursed（although I curse myself）be the hands that formed you！You have made me wretched beyond expression．You have left me no power to consider whether I am just to you or not．Begone！Relieve me from the sight of your detested form．”

“Thus I relieve thee，my creator，”he said，and placed his hated hands before my eyes，which I flung from me with violence；“thus I take from thee a sight which you abhor．Still thou canst listen to me and grant me thy compassion．By the virtues that I once possessed，I demand this from you．Hear my tale；it is long and strange，and the temperature of this place is not fitting to your fine sensations；come to the hut upon the mountain．The sun is yet high in the heavens；before it descends to hide itself behind your snowy precipices and illuminate another world，you will have heard my story and can decide．On you it rests，whether I quit forever the neighbourhood of man and lead a harmless life，or become the scourge of your fellow creatures and the author of your own speedy ruin．”

As he said this he led the way across the ice；I followed．My heart was full，and I did not answer him，but as I proceeded，I weighed the various arguments that he had used and determined at least to listen to his tale．I was partly urged by curiosity，and compassion confirmed my resolution．I had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my brother，and I eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion．For the first time，also，I felt what the duties of a creator towards his creature were，and that I ought to render him happy before I complained of his wickedness．These motives urged me to comply with his demand．We crossed the ice，therefore，and ascended the opposite rock．The air was cold，and the rain again began to descend；we entered the hut，the fiend with an air of exultation，I with a heavy heart and depressed spirits．But I consented to listen，and seating myself by the fire which my odious companion had lighted，he thus began his tale．





Chapter 11


“It is with considerable difficulty that I remember the original era of my being；all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct．A strange multiplicity of sensations seized me，and I saw，felt，heard，and smelt at the same time；and it was，indeed，a long time before I learned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses．By degrees，I remember，a stronger light pressed upon my nerves，so that I was obliged to shut my eyes．Darkness then came over me and troubled me，but hardly had I felt this when，by opening my eyes，as I now suppose，the light poured in upon me again．I walked and，I believe，descended，but I presently found a great alteration in my sensations．Before，dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me，impervious to my touch or sight；but I now found that I could wander on at liberty，with no obstacles which I could not either surmount or avoid．The light became more and more oppressive to me，and the heat wearying me as I walked，I sought a place where I could receive shade．This was the forest near Ingolstadt；and here I lay by the side of a brook resting from my fatigue，until I felt tormented by hunger and thirst．This roused me from my nearly dormant state，and I ate some berries which I found hanging on the trees or lying on the ground．I slaked my thirst at the brook，and then lying down，was overcome by sleep．

“It was dark when I awoke；I felt cold also，and half frightened，as it were，instinctively，finding myself so desolate．Before I had quitted your apartment，on a sensation of cold，I had covered myself with some clothes，but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of night．I was a poor，helpless，miserable wretch；I knew，and could distinguish，nothing；but feeling pain invade me on all sides，I sat down and wept．

“Soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of pleasure．I started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the trees．(1) I gazed with a kind of wonder．It moved slowly，but it enlightened my path，and I again went out in search of berries．I was still cold when under one of the trees I found a huge cloak，with which I covered myself，and sat down upon the ground．No distinct ideas occupied my mind；all was confused．I felt light，and hunger，and thirst，and darkness；innumerable sounds rang in my ears，and on all sides various scents saluted me；the only object that I could distinguish was the bright moon，and I fixed my eyes on that with pleasure．

“Several changes of day and night passed，and the orb of night had greatly lessened，when I began to distinguish my sensations from each other．I gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with drink and the trees that shaded me with their foliage．I was delighted when I first discovered that a pleasant sound，which often saluted my ears，proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who had often intercepted the light from my eyes．I began also to observe，with greater accuracy，the forms that surrounded me and to perceive the boundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me．Sometimes I tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable．Sometimes I wished to express my sensations in my own mode，but the uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into silence again．

“The moon had disappeared from the night，and again，with a lessened form，showed itself，while I still remained in the forest．My sensations had by this time become distinct，and my mind received every day additional ideas．My eyes became accustomed to the light and to perceive objects in their right forms；I distinguished the insect from the herb，and by degrees，one herb from another．I found that the sparrow uttered none but harsh notes，whilst those of the blackbird and thrush were sweet and enticing．

“One day，when I was oppressed by cold，I found a fire which had been left by some wandering beggars，and was overcome with delight at the warmth I experienced from it．In my joy I thrust my hand into the live embers，but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain．How strange，I thought，that the same cause should produce such opposite effects！I examined the materials of the fire，and to my joy found it to be composed of wood．I quickly collected some branches，but they were wet and would not burn．I was pained at this and sat still watching the operation of the fire．The wet wood which I had placed near the heat dried and itself became inflamed．I reflected on this，and by touching the various branches，I discovered the cause and busied myself in collecting a great quantity of wood，that I might dry it and have a plentiful supply of fire．When night came on and brought sleep with it，I was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished．I covered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches upon it；and then，spreading my cloak，I lay on the ground and sank into sleep．

“It was morning when I awoke，and my first care was to visit the fire．I uncovered it，and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame．I observed this also and contrived a fan of branches，which roused the embers when they were nearly extinguished．When night came again I found，with pleasure，that the fire gave light as well as heat and that the discovery of this element was useful to me in my food，for I found some of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted，and tasted much more savoury than the berries I gathered from the trees．I tried，therefore，to dress my food in the same manner，placing it on the live embers．I found that the berries were spoiled by this operation，and the nuts and roots much improved．

“Food，however，became scarce，and I often spent the whole day searching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger．When I found this，I resolved to quit the place that I had hitherto inhabited，to seek for one where the few wants I experienced would be more easily satisfied．In this emigration I exceedingly lamented the loss of the fire which I had obtained through accident and knew not how to reproduce it．I gave several hours to the serious consideration of this difficulty，but I was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply it，and wrapping myself up in my cloak，I struck across the wood towards the setting sun．I passed three days in these rambles and at length discovered the open country．A great fall of snow had taken place the night before，and the fields were of one uniform white；the appearance was disconsolate，and I found my feet chilled by the cold damp substance that covered the ground．

“It was about seven in the morning，and I longed to obtain food and shelter；at length I perceived a small hut，on a rising ground，which had doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd．This was a new sight to me，and I examined the structure with great curiosity．Finding the door open，I entered．An old man sat in it，near a fire，over which he was preparing his breakfast．He turned on hearing a noise，and perceiving me，shrieked loudly，and quitting the hut，ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form hardly appeared capable．His appearance，different from any I had ever before seen，and his flight somewhat surprised me．But I was enchanted by the appearance of the hut；here the snow and rain could not penetrate；the ground was dry；and it presented to me then as exquisite and divine a retreat as Pandemonium appeared to the demons of hell after their sufferings in the lake of fire．I greedily devoured the remnants of the shepherd's breakfast，which consisted of bread，cheese，milk，and wine；the latter，however，I did not like．Then，overcome by fatigue，I lay down among some straw and fell asleep．

“It was noon when I awoke，and allured by the warmth of the sun，which shone brightly on the white ground，I determined to recommence my travels；and，depositing the remains of the peasant's breakfast in a wallet I found，I proceeded across the fields for several hours，until at sunset I arrived at a village．How miraculous did this appear！The huts，the neater cottages，and stately houses engaged my admiration by turns．The vegetables in the gardens，the milk and cheese that I saw placed at the windows of some of the cottages，allured my appetite．One of the best of these I entered，but I had hardly placed my foot within the door before the children shrieked，and one of the women fainted．The whole village was roused；some fled，some attacked me，until，grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons，I escaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel，quite bare，and making a wretched appearance after the palaces I had beheld in the village．This hovel，however，joined a cottage of a neat and pleasant appearance，but after my late dearly bought experience，I dared not enter it．My place of refuge was constructed of wood，but so low that I could with difficulty sit upright in it．No wood，however，was placed on the earth，which formed the floor，but it was dry；and although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks，I found it an agreeable asylum from the snow and rain．

“Here，then，I retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter，however miserable，from the inclemency of the season，and still more from the barbarity of man．

“As soon as morning dawned I crept from my kennel，that I might view the adjacent cottage and discover if I could remain in the habitation I had found．It was situated against the back of the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig sty and a clear pool of water．One part was open，and by that I had crept in；but now I covered every crevice by which I might be perceived with stones and wood，yet in such a manner that I might move them on occasion to pass out；all the light I enjoyed came through the sty，and that was sufficient for me．

“Having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw，I retired，for I saw the figure of a man at a distance，and I remembered too well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power．I had first，however，provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf of coarse bread，which I purloined，and a cup with which I could drink more conveniently than from my hand of the pure water which flowed by my retreat．The floor was a little raised，so that it was kept perfectly dry，and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was tolerably warm．

“Being thus provided，I resolved to reside in this hovel until something should occur which might alter my determination．It was indeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest，my former residence，the rain-dropping branches，and dank earth．I ate my breakfast with pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little water when I heard a step，and looking through a small chink，I beheld a young creature，with a pail on her head，passing before my hovel．The girl was young and of gentle demeanour，unlike what I have since found cottagers and farmhouse servants to be．Yet she was meanly dressed，a coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb；her fair hair was plaited but not adorned：she looked patient yet sad．I lost sight of her，and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing the pail，which was now partly filled with milk．As she walked along，seemingly incommoded by the burden，a young man met her，whose countenance expressed a deeper despondence．Uttering a few sounds with an air of melancholy，he took the pail from her head and bore it to the cottage himself．She followed，and they disappeared．Presently I saw the young man again，with some tools in his hand，cross the field behind the cottage；and the girl was also busied，sometimes in the house and sometimes in the yard．

“On examining my dwelling，I found that one of the windows of the cottage had formerly occupied a part of it，but the panes had been filled up with wood．In one of these was a small and almost imperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate．Through this crevice a small room was visible，whitewashed and clean but very bare of furniture．In one corner，near a small fire，sat an old man，leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude．The young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage；but presently she took something out of a drawer，which employed her hands，and she sat down beside the old man，who，taking up an instrument，began to play and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the nightingale．It was a lovely sight，even to me，poor wretch who had never beheld aught beautiful before．The silver hair and benevolent countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence，while the gentle manners of the girl enticed my love．He played a sweet mournful air which I perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion，of which the old man took no notice，until she sobbed audibly；he then pronounced a few sounds，and the fair creature，leaving her work，knelt at his feet．He raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection that I felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature；they were a mixture of pain and pleasure，such as I had never before experienced，either from hunger or cold，warmth or food；and I withdrew from the window，unable to bear these emotions．

“Soon after this the young man returned，bearing on his shoulders a load of wood．The girl met him at the door，helped to relieve him of his burden，and taking some of the fuel into the cottage，placed it on the fire；then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage，and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese．She seemed pleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants，which she placed in water，and then upon the fire．She afterwards continued her work，whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busily employed in digging and pulling up roots．After he had been employed thus about an hour，the young woman joined him and they entered the cottage together．

“The old man had，in the meantime，been pensive，but on the appearance of his companions he assumed a more cheerful air，and they sat down to eat．The meal was quickly dispatched．The young woman was again occupied in arranging the cottage，the old man walked before the cottage in the sun for a few minutes，leaning on the arm of the youth．Nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent creatures．One was old，with silver hairs and a countenance beaming with benevolence and love；the younger was slight and graceful in his figure，and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry，yet his eyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency．The old man returned to the cottage，and the youth，with tools different from those he had used in the morning，directed his steps across the fields．

“Night quickly shut in，but to my extreme wonder，I found that the cottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers，and was delighted to find that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the pleasure I experienced in watching my human neighbours．In the evening the young girl and her companion were employed in various occupations which I did not understand；and the old man again took up the instrument which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in the morning．So soon as he had finished，the youth began，not to play，but to utter sounds that were monotonous，and neither resembling the harmony of the old man's instrument nor the songs of the birds；I since found that he read aloud，but at that time I knew nothing of the science of words or letters．

“The family，after having been thus occupied for a short time，extinguished their lights and retired，as I conjectured，to rest．”

Chapter 12


“I lay on my straw，but I could not sleep．I thought of the occurrences of the day．What chiefly struck me was the gentle manners of these people，and I longed to join them，but dared not．I remembered too well the treatment I had suffered the night before from the barbarous villagers，and resolved，whatever course of conduct I might hereafter think it right to pursue，that for the present I would remain quietly in my hovel，watching and endeavouring to discover the motives which influenced their actions．

“The cottagers arose the next morning before the sun．The young woman arranged the cottage and prepared the food，and the youth departed after the first meal．

“This day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it．The young man was constantly employed out of doors，and the girl in various laborious occupations within．The old man，whom I soon perceived to be blind，employed his leisure hours on his instrument or in contemplation．Nothing could exceed the love and respect which the younger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion．They performed towards him every little office of affection and duty with gentleness，and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles．

“They were not entirely happy．The young man and his companion often went apart and appeared to weep．I saw no cause for their unhappiness，but I was deeply affected by it．If such lovely creatures were miserable，it was less strange that I，an imperfect and solitary being，should be wretched．Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy？They possessed a delightful house（for such it was in my eyes）and every luxury；they had a fire to warm them when chill and delicious viands when hungry；they were dressed in excellent clothes；and，still more，they enjoyed one another's company and speech，interchanging each day looks of affection and kindness．What did their tears imply？Did they really express pain？I was at first unable to solve these questions，but perpetual attention and time explained to me many appearances which were at first enigmatic．

“A considerable period elapsed before I discovered one of the causes of the uneasiness of this amiable family：it was poverty，and they suffered that evil in a very distressing degree．Their nourishment consisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk of one cow，which gave very little during the winter，when its masters could scarcely procure food to support it．They often，I believe，suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly，especially the two younger cottagers，for several times they placed food before the old man when they reserved none for themselves．

“This trait of kindness moved me sensibly．I had been accustomed，during the night，to steal a part of their store for my own consumption，but when I found that in doing this I inflicted pain on the cottagers，I abstained and satisfied myself with berries，nuts，and roots which I gathered from a neighbouring wood．

“I discovered also another means through which I was enabled to assist their labours．I found that the youth spent a great part of each day in collecting wood for the family fire，and during the night I often took his tools，the use of which I quickly discovered，and brought home firing sufficient for the consumption of several days．

“I remember，the first time that I did this，the young woman，when she opened the door in the morning，appeared greatly astonished on seeing a great pile of wood on the outside．She uttered some words in a loud voice，and the youth joined her，who also expressed surprise．I observed，with pleasure，that he did not go to the forest that day，but spent it in repairing the cottage and cultivating the garden．

“By degrees I made a discovery of still greater moment．I found that these people possessed a method of communicating their experience and feelings to one another by articulate sounds．I perceived that the words they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain，smiles or sadness，in the minds and countenances of the hearers．This was indeed a godlike science，and I ardently desired to become acquainted with it．But I was baffled in every attempt I made for this purpose．Their pronunciation was quick，and the words they uttered，not having any apparent connection with visible objects，I was unable to discover any clue by which I could unravel the mystery of their reference．By great application，however，and after having remained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel，I discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of discourse；I learned and applied the words，‘fire，’ ‘milk，’ ‘bread，’ and ‘wood．’ I learned also the names of the cottagers themselves．The youth and his companion had each of them several names，but the old man had only one，which was ‘father．’ The girl was called ‘sister’ or ‘Agatha，’ and the youth ‘Felix，’ ‘brother，’ or ‘son．’ I cannot describe the delight I felt when I learned the ideas appropriated to each of these sounds and was able to pronounce them．I distinguished several other words without being able as yet to understand or apply them，such as ‘good，’ ‘dearest，’ ‘unhappy．’

“I spent the winter in this manner．The gentle manners and beauty of the cottagers greatly endeared them to me；when they were unhappy，I felt depressed；when they rejoiced，I sympathized in their joys．I saw few human beings besides them，and if any other happened to enter the cottage，their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the superior accomplishments of my friends．The old man，I could perceive，often endeavoured to encourage his children，as sometimes I found that he called them，to cast off their melancholy．He would talk in a cheerful accent，with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure even upon me．Agatha listened with respect，her eyes sometimes filled with tears，which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived；but I generally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after having listened to the exhortations of her father．It was not thus with Felix．He was always the saddest of the group，and even to my unpractised senses，he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his friends．But if his countenance was more sorrowful，his voice was more cheerful than that of his sister，especially when he addressed the old man．

“I could mention innumerable instances which，although slight，marked the dispositions of these amiable cottagers．In the midst of poverty and want，Felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little white flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground．Early in the morning，before she had risen，he cleared away the snow that obstructed her path to the milk-house，drew water from the well，and brought the wood from the out-house，where，to his perpetual astonishment，he found his store always replenished by an invisible hand．In the day，I believe，he worked sometimes for a neighbouring farmer，because he often went forth and did not return until dinner，yet brought no wood with him．At other times he worked in the garden，but as there was little to do in the frosty season，he read to the old man and Agatha．

“This reading had puzzled me extremely at first，but by degrees I discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when he talked．I conjectured，therefore，that he found on the paper signs for speech which he understood，and I ardently longed to comprehend these also；but how was that possible when I did not even understand the sounds for which they stood as signs？I improved，however，sensibly in this science，but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of conversation，although I applied my whole mind to the endeavour，for I easily perceived that，although I eagerly longed to discover myself to the cottagers，I ought not to make the attempt until I had first become master of their language，which knowledge might enable me to make them overlook the deformity of my figure，for with this also the contrast perpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted．

“I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers—their grace，beauty，and delicate complexions；but how was I terrified when I viewed myself in a transparent pool！At first I started back，unable to believe that it was indeed I who was reflected in the mirror；and when I became fully convinced that I was in reality the monster that I am，I was filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification．Alas！I did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable deformity．

“As the sun became warmer and the light of day longer，the snow vanished，and I beheld the bare trees and the black earth．From this time Felix was more employed，and the heart-moving indications of impending famine disappeared．Their food，as I afterwards found，was coarse，but it was wholesome；and they procured a sufficiency of it．Several new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden，which they dressed；and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season advanced．

“The old man，leaning on his son，walked each day at noon，when it did not rain，as I found it was called when the heavens poured forth its waters．This frequently took place，but a high wind quickly dried the earth，and the season became far more pleasant than it had been．

“My mode of life in my hovel was uniform．During the morning I attended the motions of the cottagers，and when they were dispersed in various occupations，I slept；the remainder of the day was spent in observing my friends．When they had retired to rest，if there was any moon or the night was star-light，I went into the woods and collected my own food and fuel for the cottage．When I returned，as often as it was necessary，I cleared their path from the snow and performed those offices that I had seen done by Felix．I afterwards found that these labours，performed by an invisible hand，greatly astonished them；and once or twice I heard them，on these occasions，utter the words ‘good spirit，’ ‘wonderful’；but I did not then understand the signification of these terms．

“My thoughts now became more active，and I longed to discover the motives and feelings of these lovely creatures；I was inquisitive to know why Felix appeared so miserable and Agatha so sad．I thought（foolish wretch！）that it might be in my power to restore happiness to these deserving people．When I slept or was absent，the forms of the venerable blind father，the gentle Agatha，and the excellent Felix flitted before me．I looked upon them as superior beings who would be the arbiters of my future destiny．I formed in my imagination a thousand pictures of presenting myself to them，and their reception of me．I imagined that they would be disgusted，until，by my gentle demeanour and conciliating words，I should first win their favour and afterwards their love．

“These thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ardour to the acquiring the art of language．My organs were indeed harsh，but supple；and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their tones，yet I pronounced such words as I understood with tolerable ease．It was as the ass and the lap-dog；yet surely the gentle ass whose intentions were affectionate，although his manners were rude，deserved better treatment than blows and execration．

“The pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the aspect of the earth．Men who before this change seemed to have been hid in caves dispersed themselves and were employed in various arts of cultivation．The birds sang in more cheerful notes，and the leaves began to bud forth on the trees．Happy，happy earth！Fit habitation for gods，which，so short a time before，was bleak，damp，and unwholesome．My spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of nature；the past was blotted from my memory，the present was tranquil，and the future gilded by bright rays of hope and anticipations of joy．”





Chapter 13


“I now hasten to the more moving part of my story．I shall relate events that impressed me with feelings which，from what I had been，have made me what I am．

“Spring advanced rapidly；the weather became fine and the skies cloudless．It surprised me that what before was desert and gloomy should now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure．My senses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight and a thousand sights of beauty．

“It was on one of these days，when my cottagers periodically rested from labour—the old man played on his guitar，and the children listened to him—that I observed the countenance of Felix was melancholy beyond expression；he sighed frequently，and once his father paused in his music，and I conjectured by his manner that he inquired the cause of his son's sorrow．Felix replied in a cheerful accent，and the old man was recommencing his music when someone tapped at the door．

“It was a lady on horseback，accompanied by a countryman as a guide．The lady was dressed in a dark suit and covered with a thick black veil．Agatha asked a question，to which the stranger only replied by pronouncing，in a sweet accent，the name of Felix．Her voice was musical but unlike that of either of my friends．On hearing this word，Felix came up hastily to the lady，who，when she saw him，threw up her veil，and I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression．Her hair of a shining raven black，and curiously braided；her eyes were dark，but gentle，although animated；her features of a regular proportion，and her complexion wondrously fair，each cheek tinged with a lovely pink．

“Felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her，every trait of sorrow vanished from his face，and it instantly expressed a degree of ecstatic joy，of which I could hardly have believed it capable；his eyes sparkled，as his cheek flushed with pleasure；and at that moment I thought him as beautiful as the stranger．She appeared affected by different feelings；wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes，she held out her hand to Felix，who kissed it rapturously and called her，as well as I could distinguish，his sweet Arabian．She did not appear to understand him，but smiled．He assisted her to dismount，and dismissing her guide，conducted her into the cottage．Some conversation took place between him and his father，and the young stranger knelt at the old man's feet and would have kissed his hand，but he raised her and embraced her affectionately．

“I soon perceived that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds and appeared to have a language of her own，she was neither understood by nor herself understood the cottagers．They made many signs which I did not comprehend，but I saw that her presence diffused gladness through the cottage，dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the morning mists．Felix seemed peculiarly happy and with smiles of delight welcomed his Arabian．Agatha，the ever-gentle Agatha，kissed the hands of the lovely stranger，and pointing to her brother，made signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she came．Some hours passed thus，while they，by their countenances，expressed joy，the cause of which I did not comprehend．Presently I found，by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger repeated after them，that she was endeavouring to learn their language；and the idea instantly occurred to me that I should make use of the same instructions to the same end．The stranger learned about twenty words at the first lesson；most of them，indeed，were those which I had before understood，but I profited by the others．

“As night came on，Agatha and the Arabian retired early．When they separated Felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said，‘Good night，sweet Safie．’ He sat up much longer，conversing with his father，and by the frequent repetition of her name I conjectured that their lovely guest was the subject of their conversation．I ardently desired to understand them，and bent every faculty towards that purpose，but found it utterly impossible．

“The next morning Felix went out to his work，and after the usual occupations of Agatha were finished，the Arabian sat at the feet of the old man，and taking his guitar，played some airs so entrancingly beautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my eyes．She sang，and her voice flowed in a rich cadence，swelling or dying away like a nightingale of the woods．

“When she had finished，she gave the guitar to Agatha，who at first declined it．She played a simple air，and her voice accompanied it in sweet accents，but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger．The old man appeared enraptured and said some words which Agatha endeavoured to explain to Safie，and by which he appeared to wish to express that she bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music．

“The days now passed as peaceably as before，with the sole alteration that joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends．Safie was always gay and happy；she and I improved rapidly in the knowledge of language，so that in two months I began to comprehend most of the words uttered by my protectors．

“In the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage，and the green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers，sweet to the scent and the eyes，stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods；the sun became warmer，the nights clear and balmy；and my nocturnal rambles were an extreme pleasure to me，although they were considerably shortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun，for I never ventured abroad during daylight，fearful of meeting with the same treatment I had formerly endured in the first village which I entered．

“My days were spent in close attention，that I might more speedily master the language；and I may boast that I improved more rapidly than the Arabian，who understood very little and conversed in broken accents，whilst I comprehended and could imitate almost every word that was spoken．

“While I improved in speech，I also learned the science of letters as it was taught to the stranger，and this opened before me a wide field for wonder and delight．

“The book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volney's Ruins of Empires．I should not have understood the purport of this book had not Felix，in reading it，given very minute explanations．He had chosen this work，he said，because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the Eastern authors．Through this work I obtained a cursory knowledge of history and a view of the several empires at present existing in the world；it gave me an insight into the manners，governments，and religions of the different nations of the earth．I heard of the slothful Asiatics，of the stupendous genius and mental activity of the Grecians，of the wars and wonderful virtue of the early Romans—of their subsequent degenerating—of the decline of that mighty empire，of chivalry，Christianity，and kings．I heard of the discovery of the American hemisphere and wept with Safie over the hapless fate of its original inhabitants．

“These wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings．Was man，indeed，at once so powerful，so virtuous and magnificent，yet so vicious and base？He appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil principle and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and godlike．To be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour that can befall a sensitive being；to be base and vicious，as many on record have been，appeared the lowest degradation，a condition more abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm．For a long time I could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow，or even why there were laws and governments；but when I heard details of vice and bloodshed，my wonder ceased and I turned away with disgust and loathing．

“Every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me．While I listened to the instructions which Felix bestowed upon the Arabian，the strange system of human society was explained to me．I heard of the division of property，of immense wealth and squalid poverty，of rank，descent，and noble blood．

“The words induced me to turn towards myself．I learned that the possessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and unsullied descent united with riches．A man might be respected with only one of these advantages，but without either he was considered，except in very rare instances，as a vagabond and a slave，doomed to waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few！And what was I？Of my creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant，but I knew that I possessed no money，no friends，no kind of property．I was，besides，endued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome；I was not even of the same nature as man．I was more agile than they and could subsist upon coarser diet；I bore the extremes of heat and cold with less injury to my frame；my stature far exceeded theirs．When I looked around I saw and heard of none like me．Was I，then，a monster，a blot upon the earth，from which all men fled and whom all men disowned？

“I cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted upon me；I tried to dispel them，but sorrow only increased with knowledge．Oh，that I had forever remained in my native wood，nor known nor felt beyond the sensations of hunger，thirst，and heat！

“Of what a strange nature is knowledge！It clings to the mind when it has once seized on it like a lichen on the rock．I wished sometimes to shake off all thought and feeling，but I learned that there was but one means to overcome the sensation of pain，and that was death—a state which I feared yet did not understand．I admired virtue and good feelings and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my cottagers，but I was shut out from intercourse with them，except through means which I obtained by stealth，when I was unseen and unknown，and which rather increased than satisfied the desire I had of becoming one among my fellows．The gentle words of Agatha and the animated smiles of the charming Arabian were not for me．The mild exhortations of the old man and the lively conversation of the loved Felix were not for me．Miserable，unhappy wretch！

“Other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply．I heard of the difference of sexes，and the birth and growth of children，how the father doted on the smiles of the infant，and the lively sallies of the older child，how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up in the precious charge，how the mind of youth expanded and gained knowledge，of brother，sister，and all the various relationships which bind one human being to another in mutual bonds．

“But where were my friends and relations？No father had watched my infant days，no mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses；or if they had，all my past life was now a blot，a blind vacancy in which I distinguished nothing．From my earliest remembrance I had been as I then was in height and proportion．I had never yet seen a being resembling me or who claimed any intercourse with me．What was I？The question again recurred，to be answered only with groans．

“I will soon explain to what these feelings tended，but allow me now to return to the cottagers，whose story excited in me such various feelings of indignation，delight，and wonder，but which all terminated in additional love and reverence for my protectors（for so I loved，in an innocent，half-painful self-deceit，to call them）．”





Chapter 14


“Some time elapsed before I learned the history of my friends．It was one which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind，unfolding as it did a number of circumstances，each interesting and wonderful to one so utterly inexperienced as I was．

“The name of the old man was De Lacey．He was descended from a good family in France，where he had lived for many years in affluence，respected by his superiors and beloved by his equals．His son was bred in the service of his country，and Agatha had ranked with ladies of the highest distinction．A few months before my arrival they had lived in a large and luxurious city called Paris，surrounded by friends and possessed of every enjoyment which virtue，refinement of intellect，or taste，accompanied by a moderate fortune，could afford．

“The father of Safie had been the cause of their ruin．He was a Turkish merchant and had inhabited Paris for many years，when，for some reason which I could not learn，he became obnoxious to the government．He was seized and cast into prison the very day that Safie arrived from Constantinople to join him．He was tried and condemned to death．The injustice of his sentence was very flagrant；all Paris was indignant；and it was judged that his religion and wealth rather than the crime alleged against him had been the cause of his condemnation．

“Felix had accidentally been present at the trial；his horror and indignation were uncontrollable when he heard the decision of the court．He made，at that moment，a solemn vow to deliver him and then looked around for the means．After many fruitless attempts to gain admittance to the prison，he found a strongly grated window in an unguarded part of the building，which lighted the dungeon of the unfortunate Muhammadan，who，loaded with chains，waited in despair the execution of the barbarous sentence．Felix visited the grate at night and made known to the prisoner his intentions in his favour．The Turk，amazed and delighted，endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his deliverer by promises of reward and wealth．Felix rejected his offers with contempt，yet when he saw the lovely Safie，who was allowed to visit her father and who by her gestures expressed her lively gratitude，the youth could not help owning to his own mind that the captive possessed a treasure which would fully reward his toil and hazard．

“The Turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made on the heart of Felix and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in his interests by the promise of her hand in marriage so soon as he should be conveyed to a place of safety．Felix was too delicate to accept this offer，yet he looked forward to the probability of the event as to the consummation of his happiness．

“During the ensuing days，while the preparations were going forward for the escape of the merchant，the zeal of Felix was warmed by several letters that he received from this lovely girl，who found means to express her thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old man，a servant of her father who understood French．She thanked him in the most ardent terms for his intended services towards her parent，and at the same time she gently deplored her own fate．

“I have copies of these letters，for I found means，during my residence in the hovel，to procure the implements of writing；and the letters were often in the hands of Felix or Agatha．Before I depart I will give them to you；they will prove the truth of my tale；but at present，as the sun is already far declined，I shall only have time to repeat the substance of them to you．

“Safie related that her mother was a Christian Arab，seized and made a slave by the Turks；recommended by her beauty，she had won the heart of the father of Safie，who married her．The young girl spoke in high and enthusiastic terms of her mother，who，born in freedom，spurned the bondage to which she was now reduced．She instructed her daughter in the tenets of her religion and taught her to aspire to higher powers of intellect and an independence of spirit forbidden to the female followers of Muhammad．This lady died，but her lessons were indelibly impressed on the mind of Safie，who sickened at the prospect of again returning to Asia and being immured within the walls of a harem，allowed only to occupy herself with infantile amusements，ill-suited to the temper of her soul，now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble emulation for virtue．The prospect of marrying a Christian and remaining in a country where women were allowed to take a rank in society was enchanting to her．

“The day for the execution of the Turk was fixed，but on the night previous to it he quitted his prison and before morning was distant many leagues from Paris．Felix had procured passports in the name of his father，sister，and himself．He had previously communicated his plan to the former，who aided the deceit by quitting his house，under the pretence of a journey and concealed himself，with his daughter，in an obscure part of Paris．

“Felix conducted the fugitives through France to Lyons and across Mont Cenis to Leghorn，where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable opportunity of passing into some part of the Turkish dominions．

“Safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his departure，before which time the Turk renewed his promise that she should be united to his deliverer；and Felix remained with them in expectation of that event；and in the meantime he enjoyed the society of the Arabian，who exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest affection．They conversed with one another through the means of an interpreter，and sometimes with the interpretation of looks；and Safie sang to him the divine airs of her native country．

“The Turk allowed this intimacy to take place and encouraged the hopes of the youthful lovers，while in his heart he had formed far other plans．He loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a Christian，but he feared the resentment of Felix if he should appear lukewarm，for he knew that he was still in the power of his deliverer if he should choose to betray him to the Italian state which they inhabited．He revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled to prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary，and secretly to take his daughter with him when he departed．His plans were facilitated by the news which arrived from Paris．

“The government of France were greatly enraged at the escape of their victim and spared no pains to detect and punish his deliverer．The plot of Felix was quickly discovered，and De Lacey and Agatha were thrown into prison．The news reached Felix and roused him from his dream of pleasure．His blind and aged father and his gentle sister lay in a noisome dungeon while he enjoyed the free air and the society of her whom he loved．This idea was torture to him．He quickly arranged with the Turk that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity for escape before Felix could return to Italy，Safie should remain as a boarder at a convent at Leghorn；and then，quitting the lovely Arabian，he hastened to Paris and delivered himself up to the vengeance of the law，hoping to free De Lacey and Agatha by this proceeding．

“He did not succeed．They remained confined for five months before the trial took place，the result of which deprived them of their fortune and condemned them to a perpetual exile from their native country．

“They found a miserable asylum in the cottage in Germany，where I discovered them．Felix soon learned that the treacherous Turk，for whom he and his family endured such unheard-of oppression，on discovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and ruin，became a traitor to good feeling and honour and had quitted Italy with his daughter，insultingly sending Felix a pittance of money to aid him，as he said，in some plan of future maintenance．

“Such were the events that preyed on the heart of Felix and rendered him，when I first saw him，the most miserable of his family．He could have endured poverty，and while this distress had been the meed of his virtue，he gloried in it；but the ingratitude of the Turk and the loss of his beloved Safie were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable．The arrival of the Arabian now infused new life into his soul．

“When the news reached Leghorn that Felix was deprived of his wealth and rank，the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of her lover，but to prepare to return to her native country．The generous nature of Safie was outraged by this command；she attempted to expostulate with her father，but he left her angrily，reiterating his tyrannical mandate．

“A few days after，the Turk entered his daughter's apartment and told her hastily that he had reason to believe that his residence at Leghorn had been divulged and that he should speedily be delivered up to the French government；he had consequently hired a vessel to convey him to Constantinople，for which city he should sail in a few hours．He intended to leave his daughter under the care of a confidential servant，to follow at her leisure with the greater part of his property，which had not yet arrived at Leghorn．

“When alone，Safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct that it would become her to pursue in this emergency．A residence in Turkey was abhorrent to her；her religion and her feelings were alike averse to it．By some papers of her father which fell into her hands she heard of the exile of her lover and learnt the name of the spot where he then resided．She hesitated some time，but at length she formed her determination．Taking with her some jewels that belonged to her and a sum of money，she quitted Italy with an attendant，a native of Leghorn，but who understood the common language of Turkey，and departed for Germany．

“She arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the cottage of De Lacey，when her attendant fell dangerously ill．Safie nursed her with the most devoted affection，but the poor girl died，and the Arabian was left alone，unacquainted with the language of the country and utterly ignorant of the customs of the world．She fell，however，into good hands．The Italian had mentioned the name of the spot for which they were bound，and after her death the woman of the house in which they had lived took care that Safie should arrive in safety at the cottage of her lover．”





Chapter 15


“Such was the history of my beloved cottagers．It impressed me deeply．I learned，from the views of social life which it developed，to admire their virtues and to deprecate the vices of mankind．

“As yet I looked upon crime as a distant evil，benevolence and generosity were ever present before me，inciting within me a desire to become an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities were called forth and displayed．But in giving an account of the progress of my intellect，I must not omit a circumstance which occurred in the beginning of the month of August of the same year．

“One night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood where I collected my own food and brought home firing for my protectors，I found on the ground a leathern portmanteau containing several articles of dress and some books．I eagerly seized the prize and returned with it to my hovel．Fortunately the books were written in the language，the elements of which I had acquired at the cottage；they consisted of Paradise Lost，a volume of Plutarch's Lives，and the Sorrows of Werter．The possession of these treasures gave me extreme delight；I now continually studied and exercised my mind upon these histories，whilst my friends were employed in their ordinary occupations．

“I can hardly describe to you the effect of these books．They produced in me an infinity of new images and feelings，that sometimes raised me to ecstasy，but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection．In the Sorrows of Werter，besides the interest of its simple and affecting story，so many opinions are canvassed and so many lights thrown upon what had hitherto been to me obscure subjects that I found in it a never-ending source of speculation and astonishment．The gentle and domestic manners it described，combined with lofty sentiments and feelings，which had for their object something out of self，accorded well with my experience among my protectors and with the wants which were forever alive in my own bosom．But I thought Werter himself a more divine being than I had ever beheld or imagined；his character contained no pretension，but it sank deep．The disquisitions upon death and suicide were calculated to fill me with wonder．I did not pretend to enter into the merits of the case，yet I inclined towards the opinions of the hero，whose extinction I wept，without precisely understanding it．

“As I read，however，I applied much personally to my own feelings and condition．I found myself similar yet at the same time strangely unlike to the beings concerning whom I read and to whose conversation I was a listener．I sympathized with and partly understood them，but I was unformed in mind；I was dependent on none and related to none．The path of my departure was free，and there was none to lament my annihilation．My person was hideous and my stature gigantic．What did this mean？Who was I？What was I？Whence did I come？What was my destination？These questions continually recurred，but I was unable to solve them．

“The volume of Plutarch's Lives which I possessed contained the histories of the first founders of the ancient republics．This book had a far different effect upon me from the Sorrows of Werter．I learned from Werter's imaginations despondency and gloom，but Plutarch taught me high thoughts；he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my own reflections，to admire and love the heroes of past ages．Many things I read surpassed my understanding and experience．I had a very confused knowledge of kingdoms，wide extents of country，mighty rivers，and boundless seas．But I was perfectly unacquainted with towns and large assemblages of men．The cottage of my protectors had been the only school in which I had studied human nature，but this book developed new and mightier scenes of action．I read of men concerned in public affairs，governing or massacring their species．I felt the greatest ardour for virtue rise within me，and abhorrence for vice，as far as I understood the signification of those terms，relative as they were，as I applied them，to pleasure and pain alone．Induced by these feelings，I was of course led to admire peaceable lawgivers，Numa，Solon，and Lycurgus，in preference to Romulus and Theseus．The patriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a firm hold on my mind；perhaps，if my first introduction to humanity had been made by a young soldier，burning for glory and slaughter，I should have been imbued with different sensations．

“But Paradise Lost excited different and far deeper emotions．I read it，as I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands，as a true history．It moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the picture of an omnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable of exciting．I often referred the several situations，as their similarity struck me，to my own．Like Adam，I was apparently united by no link to any other being in existence；but his state was far different from mine in every other respect．He had come forth from the hands of God a perfect creature，happy and prosperous，guarded by the especial care of his Creator；he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from beings of a superior nature，but I was wretched，helpless，and alone．Many times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition，for often，like him，when I viewed the bliss of my protectors，the bitter gall of envy rose within me．

“Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings．Soon after my arrival in the hovel I discovered some papers in the pocket of the dress which I had taken from your laboratory．At first I had neglected them，but now that I was able to decipher the characters in which they were written，I began to study them with diligence．It was your journal of the four months that preceded my creation．You minutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress of your work；this history was mingled with accounts of domestic occurrences．You doubtless recollect these papers．Here they are．Everything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed origin；the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances which produced it is set in view；the minutest description of my odious and loathsome person is given，in language which painted your own horrors and rendered mine indelible．I sickened as I read．‘Hateful day when I received life！’ I exclaimed in agony．‘Accursed creator！Why did you form a monster so hideous that even you turned from me in disgust？God，in pity，made man beautiful and alluring，after his own image；but my form is a filthy type of yours，more horrid even from the very resemblance．Satan had his companions，fellow devils，to admire and encourage him，but I am solitary and abhorred．’

“These were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude；but when I contemplated the virtues of the cottagers，their amiable and benevolent dispositions，I persuaded myself that when they should become acquainted with my admiration of their virtues they would compassionate me and overlook my personal deformity．Could they turn from their door one，however monstrous，who solicited their compassion and friendship？I resolved，at least，not to despair，but in every way to fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate．I postponed this attempt for some months longer，for the importance attached to its success inspired me with a dread lest I should fail．Besides，I found that my understanding improved so much with every day's experience that I was unwilling to commence this undertaking until a few more months should have added to my sagacity．

“Several changes，in the meantime，took place in the cottage．The presence of Safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants，and I also found that a greater degree of plenty reigned there．Felix and Agatha spent more time in amusement and conversation，and were assisted in their labours by servants．They did not appear rich，but they were contented and happy；their feelings were serene and peaceful，while mine became every day more tumultuous．Increase of knowledge only discovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast I was．I cherished hope，it is true，but it vanished when I beheld my person reflected in water or my shadow in the moonshine，even as that frail image and that inconstant shade．

“I endeavoured to crush these fears and to fortify myself for the trial which in a few months I resolved to undergo；and sometimes I allowed my thoughts，unchecked by reason，to ramble in the fields of Paradise，and dared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathizing with my feelings and cheering my gloom；their angelic countenances breathed smiles of consolation．But it was all a dream；no Eve soothed my sorrows nor shared my thoughts；I was alone．I remembered Adam's supplication to his Creator．But where was mine？He had abandoned me，and in the bitterness of my heart I cursed him．

“Autumn passed thus．I saw，with surprise and grief，the leaves decay and fall，and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it had worn when I first beheld the woods and the lovely moon．Yet I did not heed the bleakness of the weather；I was better fitted by my conformation for the endurance of cold than heat．But my chief delights were the sight of the flowers，the birds，and all the gay apparel of summer；when those deserted me，I turned with more attention towards the cottagers．Their happiness was not decreased by the absence of summer．They loved and sympathized with one another；and their joys，depending on each other，were not interrupted by the casualties that took place around them．The more I saw of them，the greater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness；my heart yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures；to see their sweet looks directed towards me with affection was the utmost limit of my ambition．I dared not think that they would turn them from me with disdain and horror．The poor that stopped at their door were never driven away．I asked，it is true，for greater treasures than a little food or rest：I required kindness and sympathy；but I did not believe myself utterly unworthy of it．

“The winter advanced，and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken place since I awoke into life．My attention at this time was solely directed towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my protectors．I revolved many projects，but that on which I finally fixed was to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone．I had sagacity enough to discover that the unnatural hideousness of my person was the chief object of horror with those who had formerly beheld me．My voice，although harsh，had nothing terrible in it；I thought，therefore，that if in the absence of his children I could gain the good will and mediation of the old De Lacey，I might by his means be tolerated by my younger protectors．

“One day，when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground and diffused cheerfulness，although it denied warmth，Safie，Agatha，and Felix departed on a long country walk，and the old man，at his own desire，was left alone in the cottage．When his children had departed，he took up his guitar and played several mournful but sweet airs，more sweet and mournful than I had ever heard him play before．At first his countenance was illuminated with pleasure，but as he continued，thoughtfulness and sadness succeeded；at length，laying aside the instrument，he sat absorbed in reflection．

“My heart beat quick；this was the hour and moment of trial，which would decide my hopes or realize my fears．The servants were gone to a neighbouring fair．All was silent in and around the cottage；it was an excellent opportunity；yet，when I proceeded to execute my plan，my limbs failed me and I sank to the ground．Again I rose，and exerting all the firmness of which I was master，removed the planks which I had placed before my hovel to conceal my retreat．The fresh air revived me，and with renewed determination I approached the door of their cottage．

“I knocked．‘Who is there？’ said the old man．‘Come in．’

“I entered．‘Pardon this intrusion，’ said I；‘I am a traveller in want of a little rest；you would greatly oblige me if you would allow me to remain a few minutes before the fire．’

“‘Enter，’ said De Lacey，‘and I will try in what manner I can to relieve your wants；but，unfortunately，my children are from home，and as I am blind，I am afraid I shall find it difficult to procure food for you．’

“‘Do not trouble yourself，my kind host；I have food；it is warmth and rest only that I need．’

“I sat down，and a silence ensued．I knew that every minute was precious to me，yet I remained irresolute in what manner to commence the interview，when the old man addressed me．‘By your language，stranger，I suppose you are my countryman；are you French？’

“‘No；but I was educated by a French family and understand that language only．I am now going to claim the protection of some friends，whom I sincerely love，and of whose favour I have some hopes．’

“‘Are they Germans？’

“‘No，they are French．But let us change the subject．I am an unfortunate and deserted creature；I look around and I have no relation or friend upon earth．These amiable people to whom I go have never seen me and know little of me．I am full of fears，for if I fail there，I am an outcast in the world forever．’

“‘Do not despair．To be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate，but the hearts of men，when unprejudiced by any obvious self-interest，are full of brotherly love and charity．Rely，therefore，on your hopes；and if these friends are good and amiable，do not despair．’

“‘They are kind—they are the most excellent creatures in the world；but，unfortunately，they are prejudiced against me．I have good dispositions；my life has been hitherto harmless and in some degree beneficial；but a fatal prejudice clouds their eyes，and where they ought to see a feeling and kind friend，they behold only a detestable monster．’

“‘That is indeed unfortunate；but if you are really blameless，cannot you undeceive them？’

“‘I am about to undertake that task；and it is on that account that I feel so many overwhelming terrors．I tenderly love these friends；I have，unknown to them，been for many months in the habits of daily kindness towards them；but they believe that I wish to injure them，and it is that prejudice which I wish to overcome．’

“‘Where do these friends reside？’

“‘Near this spot．’

“The old man paused and then continued，‘If you will unreservedly confide to me the particulars of your tale，I perhaps may be of use in undeceiving them．I am blind and cannot judge of your countenance，but there is something in your words which persuades me that you are sincere．I am poor and an exile，but it will afford me true pleasure to be in any way serviceable to a human creature．’

“‘Excellent man！I thank you and accept your generous offer．You raise me from the dust by this kindness；and I trust that，by your aid，I shall not be driven from the society and sympathy of your fellow creatures．’

“‘Heaven forbid！Even if you were really criminal，for that can only drive you to desperation，and not instigate you to virtue．I also am unfortunate；I and my family have been condemned，although innocent；judge，therefore，if I do not feel for your misfortunes．’

“‘How can I thank you，my best and only benefactor？From your lips first have I heard the voice of kindness directed towards me；I shall be forever grateful；and your present humanity assures me of success with those friends whom I am on the point of meeting．’

“‘May I know the names and residence of those friends？’

“I paused．This，I thought，was the moment of decision，which was to rob me of or bestow happiness on me forever．I struggled vainly for firmness sufficient to answer him，but the effort destroyed all my remaining strength；I sank on the chair and sobbed aloud．At that moment I heard the steps of my younger protectors．I had not a moment to lose，but seizing the hand of the old man，I cried，‘Now is the time！Save and protect me！You and your family are the friends whom I seek．Do not you desert me in the hour of trial！’

“‘Great God！’ exclaimed the old man．‘Who are you？’

“At that instant the cottage door was opened，and Felix，Safie，and Agatha entered．Who can describe their horror and consternation on beholding me？Agatha fainted，and Safie，unable to attend to her friend，rushed out of the cottage．Felix darted forward，and with supernatural force tore me from his father，to whose knees I clung；in a transport of fury，he dashed me to the ground and struck me violently with a stick．I could have torn him limb from limb，as the lion rends the antelope．But my heart sank within me as with bitter sickness，and I refrained．I saw him on the point of repeating his blow，when，overcome by pain and anguish，I quitted the cottage，and in the general tumult escaped unperceived to my hovel．”





Chapter 16


“Cursed，cursed creator！Why did I live？Why，in that instant，did I not extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly bestowed？I know not；despair had not yet taken possession of me；my feelings were those of rage and revenge．I could with pleasure have destroyed the cottage and its inhabitants and have glutted myself with their shrieks and misery．

“When night came I quitted my retreat and wandered in the wood；and now，no longer restrained by the fear of discovery，I gave vent to my anguish in fearful howlings．I was like a wild beast that had broken the toils，destroying the objects that obstructed me and ranging through the wood with a staglike swiftness．Oh！What a miserable night I passed！The cold stars shone in mockery，and the bare trees waved their branches above me；now and then the sweet voice of a bird burst forth amidst the universal stillness．All，save I，were at rest or in enjoyment；I，like the arch-fiend，bore a hell within me，and finding myself un-sympathized with，wished to tear up the trees，spread havoc and destruction around me，and then to have sat down and enjoyed the ruin．

“But this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure；I became fatigued with excess of bodily exertion and sank on the damp grass in the sick impotence of despair．There was none among the myriads of men that existed who would pity or assist me；and should I feel kindness towards my enemies？No；from that moment I declared everlasting war against the species，and more than all，against him who had formed me and sent me forth to this insupportable misery．

“The sun rose；I heard the voices of men and knew that it was impossible to return to my retreat during that day．Accordingly I hid myself in some thick underwood，determining to devote the ensuing hours to reflection on my situation．

“The pleasant sunshine and the pure air of day restored me to some degree of tranquillity；and when I considered what had passed at the cottage，I could not help believing that I had been too hasty in my conclusions．I had certainly acted imprudently．It was apparent that my conversation had interested the father in my behalf，and I was a fool in having exposed my person to the horror of his children．I ought to have familiarized the old De Lacey to me，and by degrees to have discovered myself to the rest of his family，when they should have been prepared for my approach．But I did not believe my errors to be irretrievable，and after much consideration I resolved to return to the cottage，seek the old man，and by my representations win him to my party．

“These thoughts calmed me，and in the afternoon I sank into a profound sleep；but the fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by peaceful dreams．The horrible scene of the preceding day was forever acting before my eyes；the females were flying and the enraged Felix tearing me from his father's feet．I awoke exhausted，and finding that it was already night，I crept forth from my hiding-place，and went in search of food．

“When my hunger was appeased，I directed my steps towards the well-known path that conducted to the cottage．All there was at peace．I crept into my hovel and remained in silent expectation of the accustomed hour when the family arose．That hour passed，the sun mounted high in the heavens，but the cottagers did not appear．I trembled violently，apprehending some dreadful misfortune．The inside of the cottage was dark，and I heard no motion；I cannot describe the agony of this suspense．

“Presently two countrymen passed by，but pausing near the cottage，they entered into conversation，using violent gesticulations；but I did not understand what they said，as they spoke the language of the country，which differed from that of my protectors．Soon after，however，Felix approached with another man；I was surprised，as I knew that he had not quitted the cottage that morning，and waited anxiously to discover from his discourse the meaning of these unusual appearances．

“‘Do you consider，’ said his companion to him，‘that you will be obliged to pay three months' rent and to lose the produce of your garden？I do not wish to take any unfair advantage，and I beg therefore that you will take some days to consider of your determination．’

“‘It is utterly useless，’ replied Felix；‘we can never again inhabit your cottage．The life of my father is in the greatest danger，owing to the dreadful circumstance that I have related．My wife and my sister will never recover from their horror．I entreat you not to reason with me any more．Take possession of your tenement and let me fly from this place．’

“Felix trembled violently as he said this．He and his companion entered the cottage，in which they remained for a few minutes，and then departed．I never saw any of the family of De Lacey more．

“I continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of utter and stupid despair．My protectors had departed and had broken the only link that held me to the world．For the first time the feelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom，and I did not strive to control them，but allowing myself to be borne away by the stream，I bent my mind towards injury and death．When I thought of my friends，of the mild voice of De Lacey，the gentle eyes of Agatha，and the exquisite beauty of the Arabian，these thoughts vanished and a gush of tears somewhat soothed me．But again when I reflected that they had spurned and deserted me，anger returned，a rage of anger，and unable to injure anything human，I turned my fury towards inanimate objects．As night advanced I placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage，and after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden，I waited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my operations．

“As the night advanced，a fierce wind arose from the woods and quickly dispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens；the blast tore along like a mighty avalanche and produced a kind of insanity in my spirits that burst all bounds of reason and reflection．I lighted the dry branch of a tree and danced with fury around the devoted cottage，my eyes still fixed on the western horizon，the edge of which the moon nearly touched．A part of its orb was at length hid，and I waved my brand；it sank，and with a loud scream I fired the straw，and heath，and bushes；which I had collected．The wind fanned the fire，and the cottage was quickly enveloped by the flames，which clung to it and licked it with their forked and destroying tongues．

“As soon as I was convinced that no assistance could save any part of the habitation，I quitted the scene and sought for refuge in the woods．

“And now，with the world before me，whither should I bend my steps？I resolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes；but to me，hated and despised，every country must be equally horrible．At length the thought of you crossed my mind．I learned from your papers that you were my father，my creator；and to whom could I apply with more fitness than to him who had given me life？Among the lessons that Felix had bestowed upon Safie，geography had not been omitted；I had learned from these the relative situations of the different countries of the earth．You had mentioned Geneva as the name of your native town，and towards this place I resolved to proceed．

“But how was I to direct myself？I knew that I must travel in a southwesterly direction to reach my destination，but the sun was my only guide．I did not know the names of the towns that I was to pass through，nor could I ask information from a single human being；but I did not despair．From you only could I hope for succour，although towards you I felt no sentiment but that of hatred．Unfeeling，heartless creator！You had endowed me with perceptions and passions and then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind．But on you only had I any claim for pity and redress，and from you I determined to seek that justice which I vainly attempted to gain from any other being that wore the human form．

“My travels were long and the sufferings I endured intense．It was late in autumn when I quitted the district where I had so long resided．I travelled only at night，fearful of encountering the visage of a human being．Nature decayed around me，and the sun became heatless；rain and snow poured around me；mighty rivers were frozen；the surface of the earth was hard and chill，and bare，and I found no shelter．Oh，earth！How often did I imprecate curses on the cause of my being！The mildness of my nature had fled，and all within me was turned to gall and bitterness．The nearer I approached to your habitation，the more deeply did I feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart．Snow fell，and the waters were hardened，but I rested not．A few incidents now and then directed me，and I possessed a map of the country；but I often wandered wide from my path．The agony of my feelings allowed me no respite；no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could not extract its food；but a circumstance that happened when I arrived on the confines of Switzerland，when the sun had recovered its warmth and the earth again began to look green，confirmed in an especial manner the bitterness and horror of my feelings．

“I generally rested during the day and travelled only when I was secured by night from the view of man．One morning，however，finding that my path lay through a deep wood，I ventured to continue my journey after the sun had risen；the day，which was one of the first of spring，cheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of the air．I felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure，that had long appeared dead，revive within me．Half surprised by the novelty of these sensations，I allowed myself to be borne away by them，and forgetting my solitude and deformity，dared to be happy．Soft tears again bedewed my cheeks，and I even raised my humid eyes with thankfulness towards the blessed sun，which bestowed such joy upon me．

“I continued to wind among the paths of the wood，until I came to its boundary，which was skirted by a deep and rapid river，into which many of the trees bent their branches，now budding with the fresh spring．Here I paused，not exactly knowing what path to pursue，when I heard the sound of voices，that induced me to conceal myself under the shade of a cypress．I was scarcely hid when a young girl came running towards the spot where I was concealed，laughing，as if she ran from someone in sport．She continued her course along the precipitous sides of the river，when suddenly her foot slipped，and she fell into the rapid stream．I rushed from my hiding-place and with extreme labour，from the force of the current，saved her and dragged her to shore．She was senseless，and I endeavoured by every means in my power to restore animation，when I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic，who was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled．On seeing me，he darted towards me，and tearing the girl from my arms，hastened towards the deeper parts of the wood．I followed speedily，I hardly knew why；but when the man saw me draw near，he aimed a gun，which he carried，at my body and fired．I sank to the ground，and my injurer，with increased swiftness，escaped into the wood．

“This was then the reward of my benevolence！I had saved a human being from destruction，and as a recompense I now writhed under the miserable pain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone．The feelings of kindness and gentleness which I had entertained but a few moments before gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth．Inflamed by pain，I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind．But the agony of my wound overcame me；my pulses paused，and I fainted．

“For some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods，endeavouring to cure the wound which I had received．The ball had entered my shoulder，and I knew not whether it had remained there or passed through；at any rate I had no means of extracting it．My sufferings were augmented also by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their infliction．My daily vows rose for revenge—a deep and deadly revenge，such as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish I had endured．

“After some weeks my wound healed，and I continued my journey．The labours I endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or gentle breezes of spring；all joy was but a mockery which insulted my desolate state and made me feel more painfully that I was not made for the enjoyment of pleasure．

“But my toils now drew near a close，and in two months from this time I reached the environs of Geneva．

“It was evening when I arrived，and I retired to a hiding-place among the fields that surround it to meditate in what manner I should apply to you．I was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to enjoy the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect of the sun setting behind the stupendous mountains of Jura．

“At this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection，which was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child，who came running into the recess I had chosen，with all the sportiveness of infancy．Suddenly，as I gazed on him，an idea seized me that this little creature was unprejudiced and had lived too short a time to have imbibed a horror of deformity．If，therefore，I could seize him and educate him as my companion and friend，I should not be so desolate in this peopled earth．

“Urged by this impulse，I seized on the boy as he passed and drew him towards me．As soon as he beheld my form，he placed his hands before his eyes and uttered a shrill scream；I drew his hand forcibly from his face and said，‘Child，what is the meaning of this？I do not intend to hurt you；listen to me．’

“He struggled violently．‘Let me go，’ he cried；‘monster！Ugly wretch！You wish to eat me and tear me to pieces．You are an ogre．Let me go，or I will tell my papa．’

“‘Boy，you will never see your father again；you must come with me．’

“‘Hideous monster！Let me go．My papa is a syndic—he is M．Frankenstein—he will punish you．You dare not keep me．’

“‘Frankenstein！you belong then to my enemy—to him towards whom I have sworn eternal revenge；you shall be my first victim．’

“The child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which carried despair to my heart；I grasped his throat to silence him，and in a moment he lay dead at my feet．

“I gazed on my victim，and my heart swelled with exultation and hellish triumph；clapping my hands，I exclaimed，‘I too can create desolation；my enemy is not invulnerable；this death will carry despair to him，and a thousand other miseries shall torment and destroy him．’

“As I fixed my eyes on the child，I saw something glittering on his breast．I took it；it was a portrait of a most lovely woman．In spite of my malignity，it softened and attracted me．For a few moments I gazed with delight on her dark eyes，fringed by deep lashes，and her lovely lips；but presently my rage returned；I remembered that I was forever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could bestow and that she whose resemblance I contemplated would，in regarding me，have changed that air of divine benignity to one expressive of disgust and affright．

“Can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage？I only wonder that at that moment，instead of venting my sensations in exclamations and agony，I did not rush among mankind and perish in the attempt to destroy them．

“While I was overcome by these feelings，I left the spot where I had committed the murder，and seeking a more secluded hiding-place，I entered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty．A woman was sleeping on some straw；she was young，not indeed so beautiful as her whose portrait I held，but of an agreeable aspect and blooming in the loveliness of youth and health．Here，I thought，is one of those whose joy-imparting smiles are bestowed on all but me．And then I bent over her and whispered，‘Awake，fairest，thy lover is near—he who would give his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes；my beloved，awake！’

“The sleeper stirred；a thrill of terror ran through me．Should she indeed awake，and see me，and curse me，and denounce the murderer？Thus would she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me．The thought was madness；it stirred the fiend within me—not I，but she，shall suffer；the murder I have committed because I am forever robbed of all that she could give me，she shall atone．The crime had its source in her；be hers the punishment！Thanks to the lessons of Felix and the sanguinary laws of man，I had learned now to work mischief．I bent over her and placed the portrait securely in one of the folds of her dress．She moved again，and I fled．

“For some days I haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place，sometimes wishing to see you，sometimes resolved to quit the world and its miseries forever．At length I wandered towards these mountains，and have ranged through their immense recesses，consumed by a burning passion which you alone can gratify．We may not part until you have promised to comply with my requisition．I am alone and miserable；man will not associate with me；but one as deformed and horrible as myself would not deny herself to me．My companion must be of the same species and have the same defects．This being you must create．”





Chapter 17


The being finished speaking and fixed his looks upon me in the expectation of a reply．But I was bewildered，perplexed，and unable to arrange my ideas sufficiently to understand the full extent of his proposition．He continued，“You must create a female for me with whom I can live in the interchange of those sympathies necessary for my being．This you alone can do，and I demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse to concede．”

The latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had died away while he narrated his peaceful life among the cottagers，and as he said this I could no longer suppress the rage that burned within me．

“I do refuse it，”I replied；“and no torture shall ever extort a consent from me．You may render me the most miserable of men，but you shall never make me base in my own eyes．Shall I create another like yourself，whose joint wickedness might desolate the world．Begone！I have answered you；you may torture me，but I will never consent．”

“You are in the wrong，”replied the fiend；“and instead of threatening，I am content to reason with you．I am malicious because I am miserable．Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind？You，my creator，would tear me to pieces and triumph；remember that，and tell me why I should pity man more than he pities me？You would not call it murder if you could precipitate me into one of those ice-rifts and destroy my frame，the work of your own hands．Shall I respect man when he contemns me？Let him live with me in the interchange of kindness，and instead of injury I would bestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance．But that cannot be；the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our union．Yet mine shall not be the submission of abject slavery．I will revenge my injuries；if I cannot inspire love，I will cause fear，and chiefly towards you my arch-enemy，because my creator，do I swear inextinguishable hatred．Have a care；I will work at your destruction，nor finish until I desolate your heart，so that you shall curse the hour of your birth．”

A fiendish rage animated him as he said this；his face was wrinkled into contortions too horrible for human eyes to behold；but presently he calmed himself and proceeded，“I intended to reason．This passion is detrimental to me，for you do not reflect that you are the cause of its excess．If any being felt emotions of benevolence towards me，I should return them a hundred and a hundredfold；for that one creature's sake I would make peace with the whole kind！But I now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be realized．What I ask of you is reasonable and moderate；I demand a creature of another sex，but as hideous as myself；the gratification is small，but it is all that I can receive，and it shall content me．It is true，we shall be monsters，cut off from all the world；but on that account we shall be more attached to one another．Our lives will not be happy，but they will be harmless and free from the misery I now feel．Oh！My creator，make me happy；let me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit！Let me see that I excite the sympathy of some existing thing；do not deny me my request！”

I was moved．I shuddered when I thought of the possible consequences of my consent，but I felt that there was some justice in his argument．His tale and the feelings he now expressed proved him to be a creature of fine sensations，and did I not as his maker owe him all the portion of happiness that it was in my power to bestow？He saw my change of feeling and continued，“If you consent，neither you nor any other human being shall ever see us again；I will go to the vast wilds of South America．My food is not that of man；I do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite；acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment．My companion will be of the same nature as myself and will be content with the same fare．We shall make our bed of dried leaves；the sun will shine on us as on man and will ripen our food．The picture I present to you is peaceful and human，and you must feel that you could deny it only in the wantonness of power and cruelty．Pitiless as you have been towards me，I now see compassion in your eyes；let me seize the favourable moment and persuade you to promise what I so ardently desire．”

“You propose，”replied I，“to fly from the habitations of man，to dwell in those wilds where the beasts of the field will be your only companions．How can you，who long for the love and sympathy of man，persevere in this exile？You will return and again seek their kindness，and you will meet with their detestation；your evil passions will be renewed，and you will then have a companion to aid you in the task of destruction．This may not be；cease to argue the point，for I cannot consent．”

“How inconstant are your feelings！But a moment ago you were moved by my representations，and why do you again harden yourself to my complaints？I swear to you，by the earth which I inhabit，and by you that made me，that with the companion you bestow I will quit the neighbourhood of man and dwell，as it may chance，in the most savage of places．My evil passions will have fled，for I shall meet with sympathy！My life will flow quietly away，and in my dying moments I shall not curse my maker．”

His words had a strange effect upon me．I compassionated him and sometimes felt a wish to console him，but when I looked upon him，when I saw the filthy mass that moved and talked，my heart sickened and my feelings were altered to those of horror and hatred．I tried to stifle these sensations；I thought that as I could not sympathize with him，I had no right to withhold from him the small portion of happiness which was yet in my power to bestow．

“You swear，”I said，“to be harmless；but have you not already shown a degree of malice that should reasonably make me distrust you？May not even this be a feint that will increase your triumph by affording a wider scope for your revenge？”

“How is this？I must not be trifled with，and I demand an answer．If I have no ties and no affections，hatred and vice must be my portion；the love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes，and I shall become a thing of whose existence everyone will be ignorant．My vices are the children of a forced solitude that I abhor，and my virtues will necessarily arise when I live in communion with an equal．I shall feel the affections of a sensitive being and become linked to the chain of existence and events from which I am now excluded．”

I paused some time to reflect on all he had related and the various arguments which he had employed．I thought of the promise of virtues which he had displayed on the opening of his existence and the subsequent blight of all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protectors had manifested towards him．His power and threats were not omitted in my calculations；a creature who could exist in the ice caves of the glaciers and hide himself from pursuit among the ridges of inaccessible precipices was a being possessing faculties it would be vain to cope with．After a long pause of reflection I concluded that the justice due both to him and my fellow creatures demanded of me that I should comply with his request．Turning to him，therefore，I said，“I consent to your demand，on your solemn oath to quit Europe forever，and every other place in the neighbourhood of man，as soon as I shall deliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile．”

“I swear，”he cried，“by the sun，and by the blue sky of heaven，and by the fire of love that burns my heart，that if you grant my prayer，while they exist you shall never behold me again．Depart to your home and commence your labours；I shall watch their progress with unutterable anxiety；and fear not but that when you are ready I shall appear．”

Saying this，he suddenly quitted me，fearful，perhaps，of any change in my sentiments．I saw him descend the mountain with greater speed than the flight of an eagle，and quickly lost among the undulations of the sea of ice．

His tale had occupied the whole day，and the sun was upon the verge of the horizon when he departed．I knew that I ought to hasten my descent towards the valley，as I should soon be encompassed in darkness；but my heart was heavy，and my steps slow．The labour of winding among the little paths of the mountain and fixing my feet firmly as I advanced perplexed me，occupied as I was by the emotions which the occurrences of the day had produced．Night was far advanced when I came to the halfway resting-place and seated myself beside the fountain．The stars shone at intervals as the clouds passed from over them；the dark pines rose before me，and every here and there a broken tree lay on the ground；it was a scene of wonderful solemnity and stirred strange thoughts within me．I wept bitterly，and clasping my hands in agony，I exclaimed，“Oh！Stars and clouds and winds，ye are all about to mock me；if ye really pity me，crush sensation and memory；let me become as nought；but if not，depart，depart，and leave me in darkness．”

These were wild and miserable thoughts，but I cannot describe to you how the eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me and how I listened to every blast of wind as if it were a dull ugly siroc on its way to consume me．

Morning dawned before I arrived at the village of Chamounix；I took no rest，but returned immediately to Geneva．Even in my own heart I could give no expression to my sensations—they weighed on me with a mountain's weight and their excess destroyed my agony beneath them．Thus I returned home，and entering the house，presented myself to the family．My haggard and wild appearance awoke intense alarm，but I answered no question，scarcely did I speak．I felt as if I were placed under a ban—as if I had no right to claim their sympathies—as if never more might I enjoy companionship with them．Yet even thus I loved them to adoration；and to save them，I resolved to dedicate myself to my most abhorred task．The prospect of such an occupation made every other circumstance of existence pass before me like a dream，and that thought only had to me the reality of life．





Chapter 18


Day after day，week after week，passed away on my return to Geneva；and I could not collect the courage to recommence my work．I feared the vengeance of the disappointed fiend，yet I was unable to overcome my repugnance to the task which was enjoined me．I found that I could not compose a female without again devoting several months to profound study and laborious disquisition．I had heard of some discoveries having been made by an English philosopher，the knowledge of which was material to my success，and I sometimes thought of obtaining my father's consent to visit England for this purpose；but I clung to every pretence of delay and shrank from taking the first step in an undertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear less absolute to me．A change indeed had taken place in me；my health，which had hitherto declined，was now much restored；and my spirits，when unchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise，rose proportionably．My father saw this change with pleasure，and he turned his thoughts towards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy，which every now and then would return by fits，and with a devouring blackness overcast the approaching sunshine．At these moments I took refuge in the most perfect solitude．I passed whole days on the lake alone in a little boat，watching the clouds and listening to the rippling of the waves，silent and listless．But the fresh air and bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of composure，and on my return I met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile and a more cheerful heart．

It was after my return from one of these rambles that my father，calling me aside，thus addressed me，“I am happy to remark，my dear son，that you have resumed your former pleasures and seem to be returning to yourself．And yet you are still unhappy and still avoid our society．For some time I was lost in conjecture as to the cause of this，but yesterday an idea struck me，and if it is well founded，I conjure you to avow it．Reserve on such a point would be not only useless，but draw down treble misery on us all．”

I trembled violently at his exordium，and my father continued，”I confess，my son，that I have always looked forward to your marriage with our dear Elizabeth as the tie of our domestic comfort and the stay of my declining years．You were attached to each other from your earliest infancy；you studied together，and appeared，in dispositions and tastes，entirely suited to one another．But so blind is the experience of man that what I conceived to be the best assistants to my plan may have entirely destroyed it．You，perhaps，regard her as your sister，without any wish that she might become your wife．Nay，you may have met with another whom you may love；and considering yourself as bound in honour to Elizabeth，this struggle may occasion the poignant misery which you appear to feel．”

“My dear father，reassure yourself．I love my cousin tenderly and sincerely．I never saw any woman who excited，as Elizabeth does，my warmest admiration and affection．My future hopes and prospects are entirely bound up in the expectation of our union．”

“The expression of your sentiments of this subject，my dear Victor，gives me more pleasure than I have for some time experienced．If you feel thus，we shall assuredly be happy，however present events may cast a gloom over us．But it is this gloom which appears to have taken so strong a hold of your mind that I wish to dissipate．Tell me，therefore，whether you object to an immediate solemnization of the marriage．We have been unfortunate，and recent events have drawn us from that everyday tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities．You are younger；yet I do not suppose，possessed as you are of a competent fortune，that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future plans of honour and utility that you may have formed．Do not suppose，however，that I wish to dictate happiness to you or that a delay on your part would cause me any serious uneasiness．Interpret my words with candour and answer me，I conjure you，with confidence and sincerity．”

I listened to my father in silence and remained for some time incapable of offering any reply．I revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of thoughts and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion．Alas！To me the idea of an immediate union with my Elizabeth was one of horror and dismay．I was bound by a solemn promise which I had not yet fulfilled and dared not break，or if I did，what manifold miseries might not impend over me and my devoted family！Could I enter into a festival with this deadly weight yet hanging round my neck and bowing me to the ground？I must perform my engagement and let the monster depart with his mate before I allowed myself to enjoy the delight of a union from which I expected peace．

I remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to England or entering into a long correspondence with those philosophers of that country whose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable use to me in my present undertaking．The latter method of obtaining the desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory；besides，I had an insurmountable aversion to the idea of engaging myself in my loathsome task in my father's house while in habits of familiar intercourse with those I loved．I knew that a thousand fearful accidents might occur，the slightest of which would disclose a tale to thrill all connected with me with horror．I was aware also that I should often lose all self-command，all capacity of hiding the harrowing sensations that would possess me during the progress of my unearthly occupation．I must absent myself from all I loved while thus employed．Once commenced，it would quickly be achieved，and I might be restored to my family in peace and happiness．My promise fulfilled，the monster would depart forever．Or（so my fond fancy imaged）some accident might meanwhile occur to destroy him and put an end to my slavery forever．

These feelings dictated my answer to my father．I expressed a wish to visit England，but concealing the true reasons of this request，I clothed my desires under a guise which excited no suspicion，while I urged my desire with an earnestness that easily induced my father to comply．After so long a period of an absorbing melancholy that resembled madness in its intensity and effects，he was glad to find that I was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a journey，and he hoped that change of scene and varied amusement would，before my return，have restored me entirely to myself．

The duration of my absence was left to my own choice；a few months，or at most a year，was the period contemplated．One paternal kind precaution he had taken to ensure my having a companion．Without previously communicating with me，he had，in concert with Elizabeth，arranged that Clerval should join me at Strasbourg．This interfered with the solitude I coveted for the prosecution of my task；yet at the commencement of my journey the presence of my friend could in no way be an impediment，and truly I rejoiced that thus I should be saved many hours of lonely，maddening reflection．Nay，Henry might stand between me and the intrusion of my foe．If I were alone，would he not at times force his abhorred presence on me to remind me of my task or to contemplate its progress？

To England，therefore，I was bound，and it was understood that my union with Elizabeth should take place immediately on my return．My father's age rendered him extremely averse to delay．For myself，there was one reward I promised myself from my detested toils—one consolation for my unparalleled sufferings；it was the prospect of that day when，enfranchised from my miserable slavery，I might claim Elizabeth and forget the past in my union with her．

I now made arrangements for my journey，but one feeling haunted me which filled me with fear and agitation．During my absence I should leave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy and unprotected from his attacks，exasperated as he might be by my departure．But he had promised to follow me wherever I might go，and would he not accompany me to England？This imagination was dreadful in itself，but soothing inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends．I was agonized with the idea of the possibility that the reverse of this might happen．But through the whole period during which I was the slave of my creature I allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of the moment；and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend would follow me and exempt my family from the danger of his machinations．

It was in the latter end of September that I again quitted my native country．My journey had been my own suggestion，and Elizabeth therefore acquiesced，but she was filled with disquiet at the idea of my suffering，away from her，the inroads of misery and grief．It had been her care which provided me a companion in Clerval—and yet a man is blind to a thousand minute circumstances which call forth a woman's sedulous attention．She longed to bid me hasten my return；a thousand conflicting emotions rendered her mute as she bade me a tearful，silent farewell．

I threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away，hardly knowing whither I was going，and careless of what was passing around．I remembered only，and it was with a bitter anguish that I reflected on it，to order that my chemical instruments should be packed to go with me．Filled with dreary imaginations，I passed through many beautiful and majestic scenes，but my eyes were fixed and unobserving．I could only think of the bourne of my travels and the work which was to occupy me whilst they endured．

After some days spent in listless indolence，during which I traversed many leagues，I arrived at Strasbourg，where I waited two days for Clerval．He came．Alas，how great was the contrast between us！He was alive to every new scene，joyful when he saw the beauties of the setting sun，and more happy when he beheld it rise and recommence a new day．He pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape and the appearances of the sky．“This is what it is to live，”he cried；“how I enjoy existence！But you，my dear Frankenstein，wherefore are you desponding and sorrowful！”In truth，I was occupied by gloomy thoughts and neither saw the descent of the evening star nor the golden sunrise reflected in the Rhine．And you，my friend，would be far more amused with the journal of Clerval，who observed the scenery with an eye of feeling and delight，than in listening to my reflections．I，a miserable wretch，haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to enjoyment．

We had agreed to descend the Rhine in a boat from Strasbourg to Rotterdam，whence we might take shipping for London．During this voyage we passed many willowy islands and saw several beautiful towns．We stayed a day at Mannheim，and on the fifth from our departure from Strasbourg，arrived at Mainz．The course of the Rhine below Mainz becomes much more picturesque．The river descends rapidly and winds between hills，not high，but steep，and of beautiful forms．We saw many ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices，surrounded by black woods，high and inaccessible．This part of the Rhine，indeed，presents a singularly variegated landscape．In one spot you view rugged hills，ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices，with the dark Rhine rushing beneath；and on the sudden turn of a promontory，flourishing vineyards with green sloping banks and a meandering river and populous towns occupy the scene．

We travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of the labourers as we glided down the stream．Even I，depressed in mind，and my spirits continually agitated by gloomy feelings，even I was pleased．I lay at the bottom of the boat，and as I gazed on the cloudless blue sky，I seemed to drink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a stranger．And if these were my sensations，who can describe those of Henry？He felt as if he had been transported to fairy-land and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by man．“I have seen，”he said，“the most beautiful scenes of my own country；I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri，where the snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water，casting black and impenetrable shades，which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance were it not for the most verdant islands that believe the eye by their gay appearance；I have seen this lake agitated by a tempest，when the wind tore up whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the water-spout must be on the great ocean；and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain，where the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche and where their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the nightly wind；I have seen the mountains of La Valais，and the Pays de Vaud；but this country，Victor，pleases me more than all those wonders．The mountains of Switzerland are more majestic and strange，but there is a charm in the banks of this divine river that I never before saw equalled．Look at that castle which overhangs yon precipice；and that also on the island，almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees；and now that group of labourers coming from among their vines；and that village half hid in the recess of the mountain．Oh，surely the spirit that inhabits and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than those who pile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of our own country．”

Clerval！Beloved friend！Even now it delights me to record your words and to dwell on the praise of which you are so eminently deserving．He was a being formed in the“very poetry of nature．”His wild and enthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart．His soul overflowed with ardent affections，and his friendship was of that devoted and wondrous nature that the world-minded teach us to look for only in the imagination．But even human sympathies were not sufficient to satisfy his eager mind．The scenery of external nature，which others regard only with admiration，he loved with ardour：

The sounding cataract

Haunted him like a passion：the tall rock，

The mountain，and the deep and gloomy wood，

Their colours and their forms，were then to him

An appetite；a feeling，and a love，

That had no need of a remoter charm，

By thought supplied，or any interest

Unborrow'd from the eye．(1)

And where does he now exist？Is this gentle and lovely being lost forever？Has this mind，so replete with ideas，imaginations fanciful and magnificent，which formed a world，whose existence depended on the life of its creator—has this mind perished？Does it now only exist in my memory？No，it is not thus；your form so divinely wrought，and beaming with beauty，has decayed，but your spirit still visits and consoles your unhappy friend．

Pardon this gush of sorrow；these ineffectual words are but a slight tribute to the unexampled worth of Henry，but they soothe my heart，overflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates．I will proceed with my tale．

Beyond Cologne we descended to the plains of Holland；and we resolved to post the remainder of our way，for the wind was contrary and the stream of the river was too gentle to aid us．

Our journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful scenery，but we arrived in a few days at Rotterdam，whence we proceeded by sea to England．It was on a clear morning，in the latter days of December，that I first saw the white cliffs of Britain．The banks of the Thames presented a new scene；they were flat but fertile，and almost every town was marked by the remembrance of some story．We saw Tilbury Fort and remembered the Spanish Armada，Gravesend，Woolwich，and Greenwich—places which I had heard of even in my country．

At length we saw the numerous steeples of London，St．Paul's towering above all，and the Tower famed in English history．

Chapter 19


London was our present point of rest；we determined to remain several months in this wonderful and celebrated city．Clerval desired the intercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at this time，but this was with me a secondary object；I was principally occupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for the completion of my promise and quickly availed myself of the letters of introduction that I had brought with me，addressed to the most distinguished natural philosophers．

If this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness，it would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure．But a blight had come over my existence，and I only visited these people for the sake of the information they might give me on the subject in which my interest was so terribly profound．Company was irksome to me；when alone，I could fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth；the voice of Henry soothed me，and I could thus cheat myself into a transitory peace．But busy，uninteresting，joyous faces brought back despair to my heart．I saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my fellow men；this barrier was sealed with the blood of William and Justine，and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled my soul with anguish．

But in Clerval I saw the image of my former self；he was inquisitive and anxious to gain experience and instruction．The difference of manners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of instruction and amusement．He was also pursuing an object he had long had in view．His design was to visit India，in the belief that he had in his knowledge of its various languages，and in the views he had taken of its society，the means of materially assisting the progress of European colonization and trade．In Britain only could he further the execution of his plan．He was forever busy，and the only check to his enjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind．I tried to conceal this as much as possible，that I might not debar him from the pleasures natural to one who was entering on a new scene of life，undisturbed by any care or bitter recollection．I often refused to accompany him，alleging another engagement，that I might remain alone．I now also began to collect the materials necessary for my new creation，and this was to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling on the head．Every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme anguish，and every word that I spoke in allusion to it caused my lips to quiver，and my heart to palpitate．

After passing some months in London，we received a letter from a person in Scotland who had formerly been our visitor at Geneva．He mentioned the beauties of his native country and asked us if those were not sufficient allurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as Perth，where he resided．Clerval eagerly desired to accept this invitation，and I，although I abhorred society，wished to view again mountains and streams and all the wondrous works with which Nature adorns her chosen dwelling-places．

We had arrived in England at the beginning of October，and it was now February．We accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the north at the expiration of another month．In this expedition we did not intend to follow the great road to Edinburgh，but to visit Windsor，Oxford，Matlock，and the Cumberland lakes，resolving to arrive at the completion of this tour about the end of July．I packed up my chemical instruments and the materials I had collected，resolving to finish my labours in some obscure nook in the northern highlands of Scotland．

We quitted London on the 27th of March and remained a few days at Windsor，rambling in its beautiful forest．This was a new scene to us mountaineers；the majestic oaks，the quantity of game，and the herds of stately deer were all novelties to us．

From thence we proceeded to Oxford．As we entered this city our minds were filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted there more than a century and a half before．It was here that Charles I had collected his forces．This city had remained faithful to him，after the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of Parliament and liberty．The memory of that unfortunate king and his companions，the amiable Falkland，the insolent Goring，his queen，and son，gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which they might be supposed to have inhabited．The spirit of elder days found a dwelling here，and we delighted to trace its footsteps．If these feelings had not found an imaginary gratification，the appearance of the city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration．The colleges are ancient and picturesque；the streets are almost magnificent；and the lovely Isis，which flows beside it through meadows of exquisite verdure，is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters，which reflects its majestic assemblage of towers，and spires，and domes，embosomed among aged trees．

I enjoyed this scene，and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the memory of the past and the anticipation of the future．I was formed for peaceful happiness．During my youthful days discontent never visited my mind，and if I was ever overcome by ennui，the sight of what is beautiful in nature or the study of what is excellent and sublime in the productions of man could always interest my heart and communicate elasticity to my spirits．But I am a blasted tree；the bolt has entered my soul；and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit what I shall soon cease to be—a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity，pitiable to others and intolerable to myself．

We passed a considerable period at Oxford，rambling among its environs and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most animating epoch of English history．Our little voyages of discovery were often prolonged by the successive objects that presented themselves．We visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden and the field on which that patriot fell．For a moment my soul was elevated from its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas of liberty and self sacrifice of which these sights were the monuments and the remembrancers．For an instant I dared to shake off my chains and look around me with a free and lofty spirit，but the iron had eaten into my flesh，and I sank again，trembling and hopeless，into my miserable self．

We left Oxford with regret and proceeded to Matlock，which was our next place of rest．The country in the neighbourhood of this village resembled，to a greater degree，the scenery of Switzerland；but everything is on a lower scale，and the green hills want the crown of distant white Alps which always attend on the piny mountains of my native country．We visited the wondrous cave and the little cabinets of natural history，where the curiosities are disposed in the same manner as in the collections at Servox and Chamounix．The latter name made me tremble when pronounced by Henry，and I hastened to quit Matlock，with which that terrible scene was thus associated．

From Derby，still journeying northwards，we passed two months in Cumberland and Westmorland．I could now almost fancy myself among the Swiss mountains．The little patches of snow which yet lingered on the northern sides of the mountains，the lakes，and the dashing of the rocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me．Here also we made some acquaintances，who almost contrived to cheat me into happiness．The delight of Clerval was proportionably greater than mine；his mind expanded in the company of men of talent，and he found in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his inferiors．“I could pass my life here，”said he to me；“and among these mountains I should scarcely regret Switzerland and the Rhine．”

But he found that a traveller's life is one that includes much pain amidst its enjoyments．His feelings are forever on the stretch；and when he begins to sink into repose，he finds himself obliged to quit that on which he rests in pleasure for something new，which again engages his attention，and which also he forsakes for other novelties．

We had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and Westmorland and conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the period of our appointment with our Scotch friend approached，and we left them to travel on．For my own part I was not sorry．I had now neglected my promise for some time，and I feared the effects of the daemon's disappointment．He might remain in Switzerland and wreak his vengeance on my relatives．This idea pursued me and tormented me at every moment from which I might otherwise have snatched repose and peace．I waited for my letters with feverish impatience；if they were delayed I was miserable and overcome by a thousand fears；and when they arrived and I saw the superscription of Elizabeth or my father，I hardly dared to read and ascertain my fate．Sometimes I thought that the fiend followed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion．When these thoughts possessed me，I would not quit Henry for a moment，but followed him as his shadow，to protect him from the fancied rage of his destroyer．I felt as if I had committed some great crime，the consciousness of which haunted me．I was guiltless，but I had indeed drawn down a horrible curse upon my head，as mortal as that of crime．

I visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind；and yet that city might have interested the most unfortunate being．Clerval did not like it so well as Oxford，for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him．But the beauty and regularity of the new town of Edinburgh，its romantic castle and its environs，the most delightful in the world，Arthur's Seat，St．Bernard's Well，and the Pentland Hills compensated him for the change and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration．But I was impatient to arrive at the termination of my journey．

We left Edinburgh in a week，passing through Coupar，St．Andrew's，and along the banks of the Tay，to Perth，where our friend expected us．But I was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into their feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest；and accordingly I told Clerval that I wished to make the tour of Scotland alone．“Do you，”said I，“enjoy yourself，and let this be our rendezvous．I may be absent a month or two；but do not interfere with my motions，I entreat you；leave me to peace and solitude for a short time；and when I return，I hope it will be with a lighter heart，more congenial to your own temper．”

Henry wished to dissuade me，but seeing me bent on this plan，ceased to remonstrate．He entreated me to write often．“I had rather be with you，”he said，“in your solitary rambles，than with these Scotch people，whom I do not know；hasten，then，my dear friend，to return，that I may again feel myself somewhat at home，which I cannot do in your absence．”

Having parted from my friend，I determined to visit some remote spot of Scotland and finish my work in solitude．I did not doubt but that the monster followed me and would discover himself to me when I should have finished，that he might receive his companion．

With this resolution I traversed the northern highlands and fixed on one of the remotest of the Orkneys as the scene of my labours．It was a place fitted for such a work，being hardly more than a rock whose high sides were continually beaten upon by the waves．The soil was barren，scarcely affording pasture for a few miserable cows，and oatmeal for its inhabitants，which consisted of five persons，whose gaunt and scraggy limbs gave tokens of their miserable fare．Vegetables and bread，when they indulged in such luxuries，and even fresh water，was to be procured from the mainland，which was about five miles distant．

On the whole island there were but three miserable huts，and one of these was vacant when I arrived．This I hired．It contained but two rooms，and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable penury．The thatch had fallen in，the walls were unplastered，and the door was off its hinges．I ordered it to be repaired，bought some furniture，and took possession，an incident which would doubtless have occasioned some surprise had not all the senses of the cottagers been benumbed by want and squalid poverty．As it was，I lived ungazed at and unmolested，hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes which I gave，so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations of men．

In this retreat I devoted the morning to labour；but in the evening，when the weather permitted，I walked on the stony beach of the sea to listen to the waves as they roared and dashed at my feet．It was a monotonous yet ever-changing scene．I thought of Switzerland；it was far different from this desolate and appalling landscape．Its hills are covered with vines，and its cottages are scattered thickly in the plains．Its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky，and when troubled by the winds，their tumult is but as the play of a lively infant when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean．

In this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived，but as I proceeded in my labour，it became every day more horrible and irksome to me．Sometimes I could not prevail on myself to enter my laboratory for several days，and at other times I toiled day and night in order to complete my work．It was，indeed，a filthy process in which I was engaged．During my first experiment，a kind of enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment；my mind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour，and my eyes were shut to the horror of my proceedings．But now I went to it in cold blood，and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands．

Thus situated，employed in the most detestable occupation，immersed in a solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from the actual scene in which I was engaged，my spirits became unequal；I grew restless and nervous．Every moment I feared to meet my persecutor．Sometimes I sat with my eyes fixed on the ground，fearing to raise them lest they should encounter the object which I so much dreaded to behold．I feared to wander from the sight of my fellow creatures lest when alone he should come to claim his companion．

In the meantime I worked on，and my labour was already considerably advanced．I looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager hope，which I dared not trust myself to question but which was intermixed with obscure forebodings of evil that made my heart sicken in my bosom．





Chapter 20


I sat one evening in my laboratory；the sun had set，and the moon was just rising from the sea；I had not sufficient light for my employment，and I remained idle，in a pause of consideration of whether I should leave my labour for the night or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attention to it．As I sat，a train of reflection occurred to me which led me to consider the effects of what I was now doing．Three years before，I was engaged in the same manner and had created a fiend whose unparalleled barbarity had desolated my heart and filled it forever with the bitterest remorse．I was now about to form another being of whose dispositions I was alike ignorant；she might become ten thousand times more malignant than her mate and delight，for its own sake，in murder and wretchedness．He had sworn to quit the neighbourhood of man and hide himself in deserts，but she had not；and she，who in all probability was to become a thinking and reasoning animal，might refuse to comply with a compact made before her creation．They might even hate each other；the creature who already lived loathed his own deformity，and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence for it when it came before his eyes in the female form？She also might turn with disgust from him to the superior beauty of man；she might quit him，and he be again alone，exasperated by the fresh provocation of being deserted by one of his own species．

Even if they were to leave Europe and inhabit the deserts of the new world，yet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the daemon thirsted would be children，and a race of devils would be propagated upon the earth who might make the very existence of the species of man a condition precarious and full of terror．Had I right，for my own benefit，to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations？I had before been moved by the sophisms of the being I had created；I had been struck senseless by his fiendish threats；but now，for the first time，the wickedness of my promise burst upon me；I shuddered to think that future ages might curse me as their pest，whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at the price，perhaps，of the existence of the whole human race．

I trembled and my heart failed within me，when，on looking up，I saw by the light of the moon the daemon at the casement．A ghastly grin wrinkled his lips as he gazed on me，where I sat fulfilling the task which he had allotted to me．Yes，he had followed me in my travels；he had loitered in forests，hid himself in caves，or taken refuge in wide and desert heaths；and he now came to mark my progress and claim the fulfilment of my promise．

As I looked on him，his countenance expressed the utmost extent of malice and treachery．I thought with a sensation of madness on my promise of creating another like to him，and trembling with passion，tore to pieces the thing on which I was engaged．The wretch saw me destroy the creature on whose future existence he depended for happiness，and with a howl of devilish despair and revenge，withdrew．

I left the room，and locking the door，made a solemn vow in my own heart never to resume my labours；and then，with trembling steps，I sought my own apartment．I was alone；none were near me to dissipate the gloom and relieve me from the sickening oppression of the most terrible reveries．

Several hours passed，and I remained near my window gazing on the sea；it was almost motionless，for the winds were hushed，and all nature reposed under the eye of the quiet moon．A few fishing vessels alone specked the water，and now and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound of voices as the fishermen called to one another．I felt the silence，although I was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity，until my ear was suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore，and a person landed close to my house．

In a few minutes after，I heard the creaking of my door，as if some one endeavoured to open it softly．I trembled from head to foot；I felt a presentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants who dwelt in a cottage not far from mine；but I was overcome by the sensation of helplessness，so often felt in frightful dreams，when you in vain endeavour to fly from an impending danger，and was rooted to the spot．

Presently I heard the sound of footsteps along the passage；the door opened，and the wretch whom I dreaded appeared．Shutting the door，he approached me and said in a smothered voice，“You have destroyed the work which you began；what is it that you intend？Do you dare to break your promise？I have endured toil and misery；I left Switzerland with you；I crept along the shores of the Rhine，among its willow islands and over the summits of its hills．I have dwelt many months in the heaths of England and among the deserts of Scotland．I have endured incalculable fatigue，and cold，and hunger；do you dare destroy my hopes？”

“Begone！I do break my promise；never will I create another like yourself，equal in deformity and wickedness．”

“Slave，I before reasoned with you，but you have proved yourself unworthy of my condescension．Remember that I have power；you believe yourself miserable，but I can make you so wretched that the light of day will be hateful to you．You are my creator，but I am your master；obey！”

“The hour of my irresolution is past，and the period of your power is arrived．Your threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness；but they confirm me in a determination of not creating you a companion in vice．Shall I，in cool blood，set loose upon the earth a daemon whose delight is in death and wretchedness？Begone！I am firm，and your words will only exasperate my rage．”

The monster saw my determination in my face and gnashed his teeth in the impotence of anger．“Shall each man，”cried he，“find a wife for his bosom，and each beast have his mate，and I be alone？I had feelings of affection，and they were requited by detestation and scorn．Man！You may hate，but beware！Your hours will pass in dread and misery，and soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness forever．Are you to be happy while I grovel in the intensity of my wretchedness？You can blast my other passions，but revenge remains—revenge，henceforth dearer than light or food！I may die，but first you，my tyrant and tormentor，shall curse the sun that gazes on your misery．Beware，for I am fearless and therefore powerful．I will watch with the wiliness of a snake，that I may sting with its venom．Man，you shall repent of the injuries you inflict．”

“Devil，cease；and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice．I have declared my resolution to you，and I am no coward to bend beneath words．Leave me；I am inexorable．”

“It is well．I go；but remember，I shall be with you on your wedding-night．”

I started forward and exclaimed，“Villain！Before you sign my death-warrant，be sure that you are yourself safe．”

I would have seized him，but he eluded me and quitted the house with precipitation．In a few moments I saw him in his boat，which shot across the waters with an arrowy swiftness and was soon lost amidst the waves．

All was again silent，but his words rang in my ears．I burned with rage to pursue the murderer of my peace and precipitate him into the ocean．I walked up and down my room hastily and perturbed，while my imagination conjured up a thousand images to torment and sting me．Why had I not followed him and closed with him in mortal strife？But I had suffered him to depart，and he had directed his course towards the mainland．I shuddered to think who might be the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge．And then I thought again of his words—“I will be with you on your wedding-night．”That，then，was the period fixed for the fulfilment of my destiny．In that hour I should die and at once satisfy and extinguish his malice．The prospect did not move me to fear；yet when I thought of my beloved Elizabeth，of her tears and endless sorrow，when she should find her lover so barbarously snatched from her，tears，the first I had shed for many months，streamed from my eyes，and I resolved not to fall before my enemy without a bitter struggle．

The night passed away，and the sun rose from the ocean；my feelings became calmer，if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage sinks into the depths of despair．I left the house，the horrid scene of the last night's contention，and walked on the beach of the sea，which I almost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my fellow creatures；nay，a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me．I desired that I might pass my life on that barren rock，wearily，it is true，but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery．If I returned，it was to be sacrificed or to see those whom I most loved die under the grasp of a daemon whom I had myself created．

I walked about the isle like a restless spectre，separated from all it loved and miserable in the separation．When it became noon，and the sun rose higher，I lay down on the grass and was overpowered by a deep sleep．I had been awake the whole of the preceding night，my nerves were agitated，and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery．The sleep into which I now sank refreshed me；and when I awoke，I again felt as if I belonged to a race of human beings like myself，and I began to reflect upon what had passed with greater composure；yet still the words of the fiend rang in my ears like a death-knell；they appeared like a dream，yet distinct and oppressive as a reality．

The sun had far descended，and I still sat on the shore，satisfying my appetite，which had become ravenous，with an oaten cake，when I saw a fishing-boat land close to me，and one of the men brought me a packet；it contained letters from Geneva，and one from Clerval entreating me to join him．He said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where he was，that letters from the friends he had formed in London desired his return to complete the negotiation they had entered into for his Indian enterprise．He could not any longer delay his departure；but as his journey to London might be followed，even sooner than he now conjectured，by his longer voyage，he entreated me to bestow as much of my society on him as I could spare．He besought me，therefore，to leave my solitary isle and to meet him at Perth，that we might proceed southwards together．This letter in a degree recalled me to life，and I determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days．

Yet，before I departed，there was a task to perform，on which I shuddered to reflect；I must pack up my chemical instruments，and for that purpose I must enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work，and I must handle those utensils the sight of which was sickening to me．The next morning，at daybreak，I summoned sufficient courage and unlocked the door of my laboratory．The remains of the half-finished creature，whom I had destroyed，lay scattered on the floor，and I almost felt as if I had mangled the living flesh of a human being．I paused to collect myself and then entered the chamber．With trembling hand I conveyed the instruments out of the room，but I reflected that I ought not to leave the relics of my work to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants；and I accordingly put them into a basket，with a great quantity of stones，and laying them up，determined to throw them into the sea that very night；and in the meantime I sat upon the beach，employed in cleaning and arranging my chemical apparatus．

Nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place in my feelings since the night of the appearance of the daemon．I had before regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that，with whatever consequences，must be fulfilled；but I now felt as if a film had been taken from before my eyes and that I for the first time saw clearly．The idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur to me；the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts，but I did not reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it．I had resolved in my own mind that to create another like the fiend I had first made would be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness，and I banished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different conclusion．

Between two and three in the morning the moon rose；and I then，putting my basket aboard a little skiff，sailed out about four miles from the shore．The scene was perfectly solitary；a few boats were returning towards land，but I sailed away from them．I felt as if I was about the commission of a dreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with my fellow creatures．At one time the moon，which had before been clear，was suddenly overspread by a thick cloud，and I took advantage of the moment of darkness and cast my basket into the sea；I listened to the gurgling sound as it sank and then sailed away from the spot．The sky became clouded，but the air was pure，although chilled by the northeast breeze that was then rising．But it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensations that I resolved to prolong my stay on the water，and fixing the rudder in a direct position，stretched myself at the bottom of the boat．Clouds hid the moon，everything was obscure，and I heard only the sound of the boat as its keel cut through the waves；the murmur lulled me，and in a short time I slept soundly．

I do not know how long I remained in this situation，but when I awoke I found that the sun had already mounted considerably．The wind was high，and the waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff．I found that the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from which I had embarked．I endeavoured to change my course but quickly found that if I again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with water．Thus situated，my only resource was to drive before the wind．I confess that I felt a few sensations of terror．I had no compass with me and was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the world that the sun was of little benefit to me．I might be driven into the wide Atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in the immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me．I had already been out many hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst，a prelude to my other sufferings．I looked on the heavens，which were covered by clouds that flew before the wind，only to be replaced by others；I looked upon the sea；it was to be my grave．“Fiend，”I exclaimed，“your task is already fulfilled！”I thought of Elizabeth，of my father，and of Clerval—all left behind，on whom the monster might satisfy his sanguinary and merciless passions．This idea plunged me into a reverie so despairing and frightful that even now，when the scene is on the point of closing before me forever，I shudder to reflect on it．

Some hours passed thus；but by degrees，as the sun declined towards the horizon，the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became free from breakers．But these gave place to a heavy swell；I felt sick and hardly able to hold the rudder，when suddenly I saw a line of high land towards the south．

Almost spent，as I was，by fatigue and the dreadful suspense I endured for several hours，this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of warm joy to my heart，and tears gushed from my eyes．

How mutable are our feelings，and how strange is that clinging love we have of life even in the excess of misery！I constructed another sail with a part of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land．It had a wild and rocky appearance，but as I approached nearer I easily perceived the traces of cultivation．I saw vessels near the shore and found myself suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilized man．I carefully traced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which I at length saw issuing from behind a small promontory．As I was in a state of extreme debility，I resolved to sail directly towards the town，as a place where I could most easily procure nourishment．Fortunately I had money with me．As I turned the promontory I perceived a small neat town and a good harbour，which I entered，my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected escape．

As I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails，several people crowded towards the spot．They seemed much surprised at my appearance，but instead of offering me any assistance，whispered together with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me a slight sensation of alarm．As it was，I merely remarked that they spoke English，and I therefore addressed them in that language．“My good friends，”said I，“will you be so kind as to tell me the name of this town and inform me where I am？”

“You will know that soon enough，”replied a man with a hoarse voice．“Maybe you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste，but you will not be consulted as to your quarters，I promise you．”

I was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a stranger，and I was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and angry countenances of his companions．“Why do you answer me so roughly？”I replied．“Surely it is not the custom of Englishmen to receive strangers so inhospitably．”

“I do not know，”said the man，“what the custom of the English may be，but it is the custom of the Irish to hate villains．”

While this strange dialogue continued，I perceived the crowd rapidly increase．Their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger，which annoyed and in some degree alarmed me．I inquired the way to the inn，but no one replied．I then moved forward，and a murmuring sound arose from the crowd as they followed and surrounded me，when an ill-looking man approaching tapped me on the shoulder and said，“Come，sir，you must follow me to Mr．Kirwin's to give an account of yourself．”

“Who is Mr．Kirwin？Why am I to give an account of myself？Is not this a free country？”

“Ay，sir，free enough for honest folks．Mr．Kirwin is a magistrate，and you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was found murdered here last night．”

This answer startled me，but I presently recovered myself．I was innocent；that could easily be proved；accordingly I followed my conductor in silence and was led to one of the best houses in the town．I was ready to sink from fatigue and hunger，but being surrounded by a crowd，I thought it politic to rouse all my strength，that no physical debility might be construed into apprehension or conscious guilt．Little did I then expect the calamity that was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair all fear of ignominy or death．

I must pause here，for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory of the frightful events which I am about to relate，in proper detail，to my recollection．





Chapter 21


I was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate，an old benevolent man with calm and mild manners．He looked upon me，however，with some degree of severity，and then，turning towards my conductors，he asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion．

About half a dozen men came forward；and，one being selected by the magistrate，he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with his son and brother-in-law，Daniel Nugent，when，about ten o'clock，they observed a strong northerly blast rising，and they accordingly put in for port．It was a very dark night，as the moon had not yet risen；they did not land at the harbour，but，as they had been accustomed，at a creek about two miles below．He walked on first，carrying a part of the fishing tackle，and his companions followed him at some distance．As he was proceeding along the sands，he struck his foot against something and fell at his length on the ground．His companions came up to assist him，and by the light of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a man，who was to all appearance dead．Their first supposition was that it was the corpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the waves，but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even that the body was not then cold．They instantly carried it to the cottage of an old woman near the spot and endeavoured，but in vain，to restore it to life．It appeared to be a handsome young man，about five and twenty years of age．He had apparently been strangled，for there was no sign of any violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck．

The first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me，but when the mark of the fingers was mentioned I remembered the murder of my brother and felt myself extremely agitated；my limbs trembled，and a mist came over my eyes，which obliged me to lean on a chair for support．The magistrate observed me with a keen eye and of course drew an unfavourable augury from my manner．

The son confirmed his father's account，but when Daniel Nugent was called he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion，he saw a boat，with a single man in it，at a short distance from the shore；and as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars，it was the same boat in which I had just landed．

A woman deposed that she lived near the beach and was standing at the door of her cottage，waiting for the return of the fishermen，about an hour before she heard of the discovery of the body，when she saw a boat with only one man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corpse was afterwards found．

Another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the body into her house；it was not cold．They put it into a bed and rubbed it，and Daniel went to the town for an apothecary，but life was quite gone．

Several other men were examined concerning my landing，and they agreed that，with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night，it was very probable that I had beaten about for many hours and had been obliged to return nearly to the same spot from which I had departed．Besides，they observed that it appeared that I had brought the body from another place，and it was likely that as I did not appear to know the shore，I might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance of the town of —— from the place where I had deposited the corpse．

Mr．Kirwin，on hearing this evidence，desired that I should be taken into the room where the body lay for interment，that it might be observed what effect the sight of it would produce upon me．This idea was probably suggested by the extreme agitation I had exhibited when the mode of the murder had been described．I was accordingly conducted，by the magistrate and several other persons，to the inn．I could not help being struck by the strange coincidences that had taken place during this eventful night；but，knowing that I had been conversing with several persons in the island I had inhabited about the time that the body had been found，I was perfectly tranquil as to the consequences of the affair．

I entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin．How can I describe my sensations on beholding it？I feel yet parched with horror，nor can I reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and agony．The examination，the presence of the magistrate and witnesses，passed like a dream from my memory when I saw the lifeless form of Henry Clerval stretched before me．I gasped for breath，and throwing myself on the body，I exclaimed，“Have my murderous machinations deprived you also，my dearest Henry，of life？Two I have already destroyed；other victims await their destiny；but you，Clerval，my friend，my benefactor—”

The human frame could no longer support the agonies that I endured，and I was carried out of the room in strong convulsions．

A fever succeeded to this．I lay for two months on the point of death；my ravings，as I afterwards heard，were frightful；I called myself the murderer of William，of Justine，and of Clerval．Sometimes I entreated my attendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom I was tormented；and at others I felt the fingers of the monster already grasping my neck，and screamed aloud with agony and terror．Fortunately，as I spoke my native language，Mr．Kirwin alone understood me；but my gestures and bitter cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses．

Why did I not die？More miserable than man ever was before，why did I not sink into forgetfulness and rest？Death snatches away many blooming children，the only hopes of their doting parents；how many brides and youthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope，and the next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb！Of what materials was I made that I could thus resist so many shocks，which，like the turning of the wheel，continually renewed the torture？

But I was doomed to live and in two months found myself as awaking from a dream，in a prison，stretched on a wretched bed，surrounded by jailers，turnkeys，bolts，and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon．It was morning，I remember，when I thus awoke to understanding；I had forgotten the particulars of what had happened and only felt as if some great misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me；but when I looked around and saw the barred windows and the squalidness of the room in which I was，all flashed across my memory and I groaned bitterly．

This sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside me．She was a hired nurse，the wife of one of the turnkeys，and her countenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterize that class．The lines of her face were hard and rude，like that of persons accustomed to see without sympathizing in sights of misery．Her tone expressed her entire indifference；she addressed me in English，and the voice struck me as one that I had heard during my sufferings．

“Are you better now，sir？”said she．

I replied in the same language，with a feeble voice，“I believe I am；but if it be all true，if indeed I did not dream，I am sorry that I am still alive to feel this misery and horror．”

“For that matter，”replied the old woman，“if you mean about the gentleman you murdered，I believe that it were better for you if you were dead，for I fancy it will go hard with you！However，that's none of my business；I am sent to nurse you and get you well；I do my duty with a safe conscience；it were well if everybody did the same．”

I turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a speech to a person just saved，on the very edge of death；but I felt languid and unable to reflect on all that had passed．The whole series of my life appeared to me as a dream；I sometimes doubted if indeed it were all true，for it never presented itself to my mind with the force of reality．

As the images that floated before me became more distinct，I grew feverish；a darkness pressed around me；no one was near me who soothed me with the gentle voice of love；no dear hand supported me．The physician came and prescribed medicines，and the old woman prepared them for me；but utter carelessness was visible in the first，and the expression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the second．Who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the hangman who would gain his fee？

These were my first reflections，but I soon learned that Mr．Kirwin had shown me extreme kindness．He had caused the best room in the prison to be prepared for me（wretched indeed was the best）；and it was he who had provided a physician and a nurse．It is true，he seldom came to see me，for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of every human creature，he did not wish to be present at the agonies and miserable ravings of a murderer．He came，therefore，sometimes to see that I was not neglected，but his visits were short and with long intervals．

One day，while I was gradually recovering，I was seated in a chair，my eyes half open and my cheeks livid like those in death．I was overcome by gloom and misery and often reflected I had better seek death than desire to remain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness．At one time I considered whether I should not declare myself guilty and suffer the penalty of the law，less innocent than poor Justine had been．Such were my thoughts when the door of my apartment was opened and Mr．Kirwin entered．His countenance expressed sympathy and compassion；he drew a chair close to mine and addressed me in French，“I fear that this place is very shocking to you；can I do anything to make you more comfortable？”

“I thank you，but all that you mention is nothing to me；on the whole earth there is no comfort which I am capable of receiving．”

“I know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to one borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune．But you will，I hope，soon quit this melancholy abode，for doubtless evidence can easily be brought to free you from the criminal charge．”

“That is my least concern；I am，by a course of strange events，become the most miserable of mortals．Persecuted and tortured as I am and have been，can death be any evil to me？”

“Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonizing than the strange chances that have lately occurred．You were thrown，by some surprising accident，on this shore，renowned for its hospitality，seized immediately，and charged with murder．The first sight that was presented to your eyes was the body of your friend，murdered in so unaccountable a manner and placed，as it were，by some fiend across your path．”

As Mr．Kirwin said this，notwithstanding the agitation I endured on this retrospect of my sufferings，I also felt considerable surprise at the knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me．I suppose some astonishment was exhibited in my countenance，for Mr．Kirwin hastened to say，“Immediately upon your being taken ill，all the papers that were on your person were brought me，and I examined them that I might discover some trace by which I could send to your relations an account of your misfortune and illness．I found several letters，and，among others，one which I discovered from its commencement to be from your father．I instantly wrote to Geneva；nearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my letter．But you are ill；even now you tremble；you are unfit for agitation of any kind．”

“This suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event；tell me what new scene of death has been acted，and whose murder I am now to lament？”

“Your family is perfectly well，”said Mr．Kirwin with gentleness；“and someone，a friend，is come to visit you．”

I know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself，but it instantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my misery and taunt me with the death of Clerval，as a new incitement for me to comply with his hellish desires．I put my hand before my eyes，and cried out in agony，“Oh！Take him away！I cannot see him；for God's sake，do not let him enter！”

Mr．Kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance．He could not help regarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt and said in rather a severe tone，“I should have thought，young man，that the presence of your father would have been welcome instead of inspiring such violent repugnance．”

“My father！”cried I，while every feature and every muscle was relaxed from anguish to pleasure．“Is my father indeed come？How kind，how very kind！But where is he，why does he not hasten to me？”

My change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate；perhaps he thought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium，and now he instantly resumed his former benevolence．He rose and quitted the room with my nurse，and in a moment my father entered it．

Nothing，at this moment，could have given me greater pleasure than the arrival of my father．I stretched out my hand to him and cried，“Are you，then，safe—and Elizabeth—and Ernest？”

My father calmed me with assurances of their welfare and endeavoured，by dwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart，to raise my desponding spirits；but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode of cheerfulness．“What a place is this that you inhabit，my son！”said he，looking mournfully at the barred windows and wretched appearance of the room．“You travelled to seek happiness，but a fatality seems to pursue you．And poor Clerval—”

The name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too great to be endured in my weak state；I shed tears．

“Alas！Yes，my father，”replied I；“some destiny of the most horrible kind hangs over me，and I must live to fulfil it，or surely I should have died on the coffin of Henry．”

We were not allowed to converse for any length of time，for the precarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary that could ensure tranquillity．Mr．Kirwin came in and insisted that my strength should not be exhausted by too much exertion．But the appearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel，and I gradually recovered my health．

As my sickness quitted me，I was absorbed by a gloomy and black melancholy that nothing could dissipate．The image of Clerval was forever before me，ghastly and murdered．More than once the agitation into which these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous relapse．Alas！Why did they preserve so miserable and detested a life？It was surely that I might fulfil my destiny，which is now drawing to a close．Soon，oh，very soon，will death extinguish these throbbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears me to the dust；and，in executing the award of justice，I shall also sink to rest．Then the appearance of death was distant，although the wish was ever present to my thoughts；and I often sat for hours motionless and speechless，wishing for some mighty revolution that might bury me and my destroyer in its ruins．

The season of the assizes approached．I had already been three months in prison，and although I was still weak and in continual danger of a relapse，I was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the country town where the court was held．Mr．Kirwin charged himself with every care of collecting witnesses and arranging my defence．I was spared the disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal，as the case was not brought before the court that decides on life and death．The grand jury rejected the bill，on its being proved that I was on the Orkney Islands at the hour the body of my friend was found；and a fortnight after my removal I was liberated from prison．

My father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a criminal charge，that I was again allowed to breathe the fresh atmosphere and permitted to return to my native country．I did not participate in these feelings，for to me the walls of a dungeon or a palace were alike hateful．The cup of life was poisoned forever，and although the sun shone upon me，as upon the happy and gay of heart，I saw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness，penetrated by no light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me．Sometimes they were the expressive eyes of Henry，languishing in death，the dark orbs nearly covered by the lids and the long black lashes that fringed them；sometimes it was the watery，clouded eyes of the monster，as I first saw them in my chamber at Ingolstadt．

My father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection．He talked of Geneva，which I should soon visit，of Elizabeth and Ernest；but these words only drew deep groans from me．Sometimes，indeed，I felt a wish for happiness and thought with melancholy delight of my beloved cousin or longed，with a devouring maladie du pays，to see once more the blue lake and rapid Rhone，that had been so dear to me in early childhood；but my general state of feeling was a torpor in which a prison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in nature；and these fits were seldom interrupted but by paroxysms of anguish and despair．At these moments I often endeavoured to put an end to the existence I loathed，and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance to restrain me from committing some dreadful act of violence．

Yet one duty remained to me，the recollection of which finally triumphed over my selfish despair．It was necessary that I should return without delay to Geneva，there to watch over the lives of those I so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer，that if any chance led me to the place of his concealment，or if he dared again to blast me by his presence，I might，with unfailing aim，put an end to the existence of the monstrous image which I had endued with the mockery of a soul still more monstrous．My father still desired to delay our departure，fearful that I could not sustain the fatigues of a journey，for I was a shattered wreck—the shadow of a human being．My strength was gone．I was a mere skeleton，and fever night and day preyed upon my wasted frame．

Still，as I urged our leaving Ireland with such inquietude and impatience，my father thought it best to yield．We took our passage on board a vessel bound for Havre-de-Grace and sailed with a fair wind from the Irish shores．It was midnight．I lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening to the dashing of the waves．I hailed the darkness that shut Ireland from my sight，and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when I reflected that I should soon see Geneva．The past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream；yet the vessel in which I was，the wind that blew me from the detested shore of Ireland，and the sea which surrounded me told me too forcibly that I was deceived by no vision and that Clerval，my friend and dearest companion，had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation．I repassed，in my memory，my whole life—my quiet happiness while residing with my family in Geneva，the death of my mother，and my departure for Ingolstadt．I remembered，shuddering，the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on to the creation of my hideous enemy，and I called to mind the night in which he first lived．I was unable to pursue the train of thought；a thousand feelings pressed upon me，and I wept bitterly．

Ever since my recovery from the fever I had been in the custom of taking every night a small quantity of laudanum，for it was by means of this drug only that I was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the preservation of life．Oppressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes，I now swallowed double my usual quantity and soon slept profoundly．But sleep did not afford me respite from thought and misery；my dreams presented a thousand objects that scared me．Towards morning I was possessed by a kind of nightmare；I felt the fiend's grasp in my neck and could not free myself from it；groans and cries rang in my ears．My father，who was watching over me，perceiving my restlessness，awoke me；the dashing waves were around，the cloudy sky above，the fiend was not here：a sense of security，a feeling that a truce was established between the present hour and the irresistible，disastrous future imparted to me a kind of calm forgetfulness，of which the human mind is by its structure peculiarly susceptible．





Chapter 22


The voyage came to an end．We landed，and proceeded to Paris．I soon found that I had overtaxed my strength and that I must repose before I could continue my journey．My father's care and attentions were indefatigable，but he did not know the origin of my sufferings and sought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill．He wished me to seek amusement in society．I abhorred the face of man．Oh，not abhorred！They were my brethren，my fellow beings，and I felt attracted even to the most repulsive among them，as to creatures of an angelic nature and celestial mechanism．But I felt that I had no right to share their intercourse．I had unchained an enemy among them whose joy it was to shed their blood and to revel in their groans．How they would，each and all，abhor me and hunt me from the world did they know my unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me！

My father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society and strove by various arguments to banish my despair．Sometimes he thought that I felt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of murder，and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride．

“Alas！My father，”said I，“how little do you know me．Human beings，their feelings and passions，would indeed be degraded if such a wretch as I felt pride．Justine，poor unhappy Justine，was as innocent as I，and she suffered the same charge；she died for it；and I am the cause of this—I murdered her．William，Justine，and Henry—they all died by my hands．”

My father had often，during my imprisonment，heard me make the same assertion；when I thus accused myself，he sometimes seemed to desire an explanation，and at others he appeared to consider it as the offspring of delirium，and that，during my illness，some idea of this kind had presented itself to my imagination，the remembrance of which I preserved in my convalescence．I avoided explanation and maintained a continual silence concerning the wretch I had created．I had a persuasion that I should be supposed mad，and this in itself would forever have chained my tongue．But，besides，I could not bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill my hearer with consternation and make fear and unnatural horror the inmates of his breast．I checked，therefore，my impatient thirst for sympathy and was silent when I would have given the world to have confided the fatal secret．Yet，still，words like those I have recorded would burst uncontrollably from me．I could offer no explanation of them，but their truth in part relieved the burden of my mysterious woe．

Upon this occasion my father said，with an expression of unbounded wonder，“My dearest Victor，what infatuation is this？My dear son，I entreat you never to make such an assertion again．”

“I am not mad，”I cried energetically；“the sun and the heavens，who have viewed my operations，can bear witness of my truth．I am the assassin of those most innocent victims；they died by my machinations．A thousand times would I have shed my own blood，drop by drop，to have saved their lives；but I could not，my father，indeed I could not sacrifice the whole human race．”

The conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were deranged，and he instantly changed the subject of our conversation and endeavoured to alter the course of my thoughts．He wished as much as possible to obliterate the memory of the scenes that had taken place in Ireland and never alluded to them or suffered me to speak of my misfortunes．

As time passed away I became more calm；misery had her dwelling in my heart，but I no longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own crimes；sufficient for me was the consciousness of them．By the utmost self-violence I curbed the imperious voice of wretchedness，which sometimes desired to declare itself to the whole world，and my manners were calmer and more composed than they had ever been since my journey to the sea of ice．

A few days before we left Paris on our way to Switzerland I received the following letter from Elizabeth：

My dear Friend，

It gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a Letter from my uncle dated at Paris；you are no longer at a formidable distance，and I may hope to see you in less than a fortnight．My poor cousin，how much you must have suffered！I expect to see you Looking even more ill than when you quitted Geneva．This winter has been passed most miserably，tortured as I have been by anxious suspense；yet I hope to see peace in your countenance and to find that your heart is not totally void of comfort and tranquillity．

Yet I fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so miserable a year ago，even perhaps augmented by time．I would not disturb you at this period，when so many misfortunes weigh upon you，but a conversation that I had with my uncle previous to his departure renders some explanation necessary before we meet．

Explanation！You may possibly say，What can Elizabeth have to explain？If you really say this，my questions are answered and all my doubts satisfied．But you are distant from me，and it is possible that you may dread and yet be pleased with this explanation；and in a probabillty of this being the case，I dare not any longer postpone writing what，during your absence，I have often wished to express to you but have never had the courage to begin．

You well know，Victor，that our union had been the favourite plan of your parents ever since our infancy．We were told this when young，and taught to Look forward to it as an event that would certainly take place．We were affectionate playfellows during childhood，and，I believe，dear and valued friends to one another as we grew older．But as brother and sister often entertain a lively affection towards each other without desiring a more intimate union，may not such also be our case？Tell me，dearest Victor．Answer me，I conjure you，by our mutual happiness，with simple truth—Do you not love another？

You have travelled；you have spent several years of your life at Ingolstadt；and I confess to you，my friend，that when I saw you last autumn so unhappy，flying to solitude from the society of every creature，I could not help supposing that you might regret our connection and believe yourself bound in honour to fulfil the wishes of your parents，although they opposed themselves to your inclinations．But this is false reasoning．I confess to you，my friend，that I love you and that in my airy dreams of futurity you have been my constant friend and companion．But it is your happiness I desire as well as my own when I declare to you that our marriage would render me eternally miserable unless it were the dictate of your own free choice．Even now I weep to think that，borne down as you are by the cruellest misfortunes，you may stifle，by the word“honour，”all hope of that love and happiness which would alone restore you to yourself．I，who have so disinterested an affection for you，may increase your miseries tenfold by being an obstacle to your wishes．Ah！Victor，be assured that your cousin and playmate has too sincere a love for you not to be made miserable by this supposition．Be happy，my friend；and if you obey me in this one request，remain satisfied that nothing on earth will have the power to interrupt my tranquillity．

Do not let this Letter disturb you；do not answer tomorrow，or the next day，or even until you come，if it will give you pain．My uncle will send me news of your health，and if I see but one smile on your lips when we meet，occasioned by this or any other exertion of mine，I shall need no other happiness．

Elizabeth Lavenza

Geneva，May 18th，17—

This letter revived in my memory what I had before forgotten，the threat of the fiend—“I will be with you on your wedding-night！”Such was my sentence，and on that night would the daemon employ every art to destroy me and tear me from the glimpse of happiness which promised partly to console my sufferings．On that night he had determined to consummate his crimes by my death．Well，be it so；a deadly struggle would then assuredly take place，in which if he were victorious I should be at peace and his power over me be at an end．If he were vanquished，I should be a free man．Alas！What freedom？Such as the peasant enjoys when his family have been massacred before his eyes，his cottage burnt，his lands laid waste，and he is turned adrift，homeless，penniless，and alone，but free．Such would be my liberty except that in my Elizabeth I possessed a treasure，alas，balanced by those horrors of remorse and guilt which would pursue me until death．

Sweet and beloved Elizabeth！I read and reread her letter，and some softened feelings stole into my heart and dared to whisper paradisiacal dreams of love and joy；but the apple was already eaten，and the angel's arm bared to drive me from all hope．Yet I would die to make her happy．If the monster executed his threat，death was inevitable；yet，again，I considered whether my marriage would hasten my fate．My destruction might indeed arrive a few months sooner，but if my torturer should suspect that I postponed it，influenced by his menaces，he would surely find other and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge．He had vowed to be with me on my wedding-night，yet he did not consider that threat as binding him to peace in the meantime，for as if to show me that he was not yet satiated with blood，he had murdered Clerval immediately after the enunciation of his threats．I resolved，therefore，that if my immediate union with my cousin would conduce either to hers or my father's happiness，my adversary's designs against my life should not retard it a single hour．

In this state of mind I wrote to Elizabeth．My letter was calm and affectionate．“I fear，my beloved girl，”I said，“little happiness remains for us on earth；yet all that I may one day enjoy is centred in you．Chase away your idle fears；to you alone do I consecrate my life and my endeavours for contentment．I have one secret，Elizabeth，a dreadful one；when revealed to you，it will chill your frame with horror，and then，far from being surprised at my misery，you will only wonder that I survive what I have endured．I will confide this tale of misery and terror to you the day after our marriage shall take place，for，my sweet cousin，there must be perfect confidence between us．But until then，I conjure you，do not mention or allude to it．This I most earnestly entreat，and I know you will comply．”

In about a week after the arrival of Elizabeth's letter we returned to Geneva．The sweet girl welcomed me with warm affection，yet tears were in her eyes as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish cheeks．I saw a change in her also．She was thinner and had lost much of that heavenly vivacity that had before charmed me；but her gentleness and soft looks of compassion made her a more fit companion for one blasted and miserable as I was．

The tranquillity which I now enjoyed did not endure．Memory brought madness with it，and when I thought of what had passed，a real insanity possessed me；sometimes I was furious and burnt with rage，sometimes low and despondent．I neither spoke nor looked at anyone，but sat motionless，bewildered by the multitude of miseries that overcame me．

Elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits；her gentle voice would soothe me when transported by passion and inspire me with human feelings when sunk in torpor．She wept with me and for me．When reason returned，she would remonstrate and endeavour to inspire me with resignation．Ah！It is well for the unfortunate to be resigned，but for the guilty there is no peace．The agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is otherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of grief．

Soon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage with Elizabeth．I remained silent．

“Have you，then，some other attachment？”

“None on earth．I love Elizabeth and look forward to our union with delight．Let the day therefore be fixed；and on it I will consecrate myself，in life or death，to the happiness of my cousin．”

“My dear Victor，do not speak thus．Heavy misfortunes have befallen us，but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love for those whom we have lost to those who yet live．Our circle will be small but bound close by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune．And when time shall have softened your despair，new and dear objects of care will be born to replace those of whom we have been so cruelly deprived．”

Such were the lessons of my father．But to me the remembrance of the threat returned；nor can you wonder that，omnipotent as the fiend had yet been in his deeds of blood，I should almost regard him as invincible，and that when he had pronounced the words“I shall be with you on your wedding-night，”I should regard the threatened fate as unavoidable．But death was no evil to me if the loss of Elizabeth were balanced with it，and I therefore，with a contented and even cheerful countenance，agreed with my father that if my cousin would consent，the ceremony should take place in ten days，and thus put，as I imagined，the seal to my fate．

Great God！If for one instant I had thought what might be the hellish intention of my fiendish adversary，I would rather have banished myself forever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast over the earth than have consented to this miserable marriage．But，as if possessed of magic powers，the monster had blinded me to his real intentions；and when I thought that I had prepared only my own death，I hastened that of a far dearer victim．

As the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer，whether from cowardice or a prophetic feeling，I felt my heart sink within me．But I concealed my feelings by an appearance of hilarity that brought smiles and joy to the countenance of my father，but hardly deceived the ever-watchful and nicer eye of Elizabeth．She looked forward to our union with placid contentment，not unmingled with a little fear，which past misfortunes had impressed，that what now appeared certain and tangible happiness might soon dissipate into an airy dream and leave no trace but deep and everlasting regret．

Preparations were made for the event，congratulatory visits were received，and all wore a smiling appearance．I shut up，as well as I could，in my own heart the anxiety that preyed there and entered with seeming earnestness into the plans of my father，although they might only serve as the decorations of my tragedy．Through my father's exertions a part of the inheritance of Elizabeth had been restored to her by the Austrian government．A small possession on the shores of Como belonged to her．It was agreed that，immediately after our union，we should proceed to Villa Lavenza and spend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lake near which it stood．

In the meantime I took every precaution to defend my person in case the fiend should openly attack me．I carried pistols and a dagger constantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice，and by these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity．Indeed，as the period approached，the threat appeared more as a delusion，not to be regarded as worthy to disturb my peace，while the happiness I hoped for in my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty as the day fixed for its solemnization drew nearer and I heard it continually spoken of as an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent．

Elizabeth seemed happy；my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to calm her mind．But on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my destiny，she was melancholy，and a presentiment of evil pervaded her；and perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret which I had promised to reveal to her on the following day．My father was in the meantime overjoyed and in the bustle of preparation only recognized in the melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride．

After the ceremony was performed a large party assembled at my father's，but it was agreed that Elizabeth and I should commence our journey by water，sleeping that night at Evian and continuing our voyage on the following day．The day was fair，the wind favourable；all smiled on our nuptial embarkation．

Those were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed the feeling of happiness．We passed rapidly along；the sun was hot，but we were sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the beauty of the scene，sometimes on one side of the lake，where we saw Mont Saleve，the pleasant banks of Montalegre，and at a distance，surmounting all，the beautiful Mont Blanc and the assemblage of snowy mountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her；sometimes coasting the opposite banks，we saw the mighty Jura opposing its dark side to the ambition that would quit its native country，and an almost insurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it．

I took the hand of Elizabeth．“You are sorrowful，my love．Ah！If you knew what I have suffered and what I may yet endure，you would endeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this one day at least permits me to enjoy．”

“Be happy，my dear Victor，”replied Elizabeth；“there is，I hope，nothing to distress you；and be assured that if a lively joy is not painted in my face，my heart is contented．Something whispers to me not to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us，but I will not listen to such a sinister voice．Observe how fast we move along and how the clouds，which sometimes obscure and sometimes rise above the dome of Mont Blanc，render this scene of beauty still more interesting．Look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in the clear waters，where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at the bottom．What a divine day！How happy and serene all nature appears！”

Thus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all reflection upon melancholy subjects．But her temper was fluctuating；joy for a few instants shone in her eyes，but it continually gave place to distraction and reverie．

The sun sank lower in the heavens；we passed the river Drance and observed its path through the chasms of the higher and the glens of the lower hills．The Alps here come closer to the lake，and we approached the amphitheatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary．The spire of Evian shone under the woods that surrounded it and the range of mountain above mountain by which it was overhung．

The wind，which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity，sank at sunset to a light breeze；the soft air just ruffled the water and caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached the shore，from which it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers and hay．The sun sank beneath the horizon as we landed，and as I touched the shore I felt those cares and fears revive which soon were to clasp me and cling to me forever．





Chapter 23


It was eight o'clock when we landed；we walked for a short time on the shore，enjoying the transitory light，and then retired to the inn and contemplated the lovely scene of waters，woods，and mountains，obscured in darkness，yet still displaying their black outlines．

The wind，which had fallen in the south，now rose with great violence in the west．The moon had reached her summit in the heavens and was beginning to descend；the clouds swept across it swifter than the flight of the vulture and dimmed her rays，while the lake reflected the scene of the busy heavens，rendered still busier by the restless waves that were beginning to rise．Suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended．

I had been calm during the day，but so soon as night obscured the shapes of objects，a thousand fears arose in my mind．I was anxious and watchful，while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in my bosom；every sound terrified me，but I resolved that I would sell my life dearly and not shrink from the conflict until my own life or that of my adversary was extinguished．

Elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence，but there was something in my glance which communicated terror to her，and trembling，she asked，“What is it that agitates you，my dear Victor？What is it you fear？”

“Oh！Peace，peace，my love，”replied I；“this night，and all will be safe；but this night is dreadful，very dreadful．”

I passed an hour in this state of mind，when suddenly I reflected how fearful the combat which I momentarily expected would be to my wife，and I earnestly entreated her to retire，resolving not to join her until I had obtained some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy．

She left me，and I continued some time walking up and down the passages of the house and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to my adversary．But I discovered no trace of him and was beginning to conjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the execution of his menaces when suddenly I heard a shrill and dreadful scream．It came from the room into which Elizabeth had retired．As I heard it，the whole truth rushed into my mind，my arms dropped，the motion of every muscle and fibre was suspended；I could feel the blood trickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs．This state lasted but for an instant；the scream was repeated，and I rushed into the room．

Great God！Why did I not then expire！Why am I here to relate the destruction of the best hope and the purest creature of earth？She was there，lifeless and inanimate，thrown across the bed，her head hanging down and her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair．Everywhere I turn I see the same figure—her bloodless arms and relaxed form flung by the murderer on its bridal bier．Could I behold this and live？Alas！Life is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated．For a moment only did I lose recollection；I fell senseless on the ground．

When I recovered I found myself surrounded by the people of the inn；their countenances expressed a breathless terror，but the horror of others appeared only as a mockery，a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me．I escaped from them to the room where lay the body of Elizabeth，my love，my wife，so lately living，so dear，so worthy．She had been moved from the posture in which I had first beheld her，and now，as she lay，her head upon her arm and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck，I might have supposed her asleep．I rushed towards her and embraced her with ardour，but the deadly languor and coldness of the limbs told me that what I now held in my arms had ceased to be the Elizabeth whom I had loved and cherished．The murderous mark of the fiend's grasp was on her neck，and the breath had ceased to issue from her lips．

While I still hung over her in the agony of despair，I happened to look up．The windows of the room had before been darkened，and I felt a kind of panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber．The shutters had been thrown back，and with a sensation of horror not to be described，I saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred．A grin was on the face of the monster；he seemed to jeer，as with his fiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife．I rushed towards the window，and drawing a pistol from my bosom，fired；but he eluded me，leaped from his station，and running with the swiftness of lightning，plunged into the lake．

The report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room．I pointed to the spot where he had disappeared，and we followed the track with boats；nets were cast，but in vain．After passing several hours，we returned hopeless，most of my companions believing it to have been a form conjured up by my fancy．After having landed，they proceeded to search the country，parties going in different directions among the woods and vines．

I attempted to accompany them and proceeded a short distance from the house，but my head whirled round，my steps were like those of a drunken man，I fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion；a film covered my eyes，and my skin was parched with the heat of fever．In this state I was carried back and placed on a bed，hardly conscious of what had happened；my eyes wandered round the room as if to seek something that I had lost．

After an interval I arose，and as if by instinct，crawled into the room where the corpse of my beloved lay．There were women weeping around；I hung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs；all this time no distinct idea presented itself to my mind，but my thoughts rambled to various subjects，reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their cause．I was bewildered，in a cloud of wonder and horror．The death of William，the execution of Justine，the murder of Clerval，and lastly of my wife；even at that moment I knew not that my only remaining friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend；my father even now might be writhing under his grasp，and Ernest might be dead at his feet．This idea made me shudder and recalled me to action．I started up and resolved to return to Geneva with all possible speed．

There were no horses to be procured，and I must return by the lake；but the wind was unfavourable，and the rain fell in torrents．However，it was hardly morning，and I might reasonably hope to arrive by night．I hired men to row and took an oar myself，for I had always experienced relief from mental torment in bodily exercise．But the overflowing misery I now felt，and the excess of agitation that I endured rendered me incapable of any exertion．I threw down the oar，and leaning my head upon my hands，gave way to every gloomy idea that arose．If I looked up，I saw scenes which were familiar to me in my happier time and which I had contemplated but the day before in the company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection．Tears streamed from my eyes．The rain had ceased for a moment，and I saw the fish play in the waters as they had done a few hours before；they had then been observed by Elizabeth．Nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and sudden change．The sun might shine or the clouds might lower，but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before．A fiend had snatched from me every hope of future happiness；no creature had ever been so miserable as I was；so frightful an event is single in the history of man．

But why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this last overwhelming event？Mine has been a tale of horrors；I have reached their acme，and what I must now relate can but be tedious to you．Know that，one by one，my friends were snatched away；I was left desolate．My own strength is exhausted，and I must tell，in a few words，what remains of my hideous narration．

I arrived at Geneva．My father and Ernest yet lived，but the former sunk under the tidings that I bore．I see him now，excellent and venerable old man！His eyes wandered in vacancy，for they had lost their charm and their delight—his Elizabeth，his more than daughter，whom he doted on with all that affection which a man feels，who in the decline of life，having few affections，clings more earnestly to those that remain．Cursed，cursed be the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to waste in wretchedness！He could not live under the horrors that were accumulated around him；the springs of existence suddenly gave way；he was unable to rise from his bed，and in a few days he died in my arms．

What then became of me？I know not；I lost sensation，and chains and darkness were the only objects that pressed upon me．Sometimes，indeed，I dreamt that I wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales with the friends of my youth，but I awoke and found myself in a dungeon．Melancholy followed，but by degrees I gained a clear conception of my miseries and situation and was then released from my prison．For they had called me mad，and during many months，as I understood，a solitary cell had been my habitation．

Liberty，however，had been a useless gift to me，had I not，as I awakened to reason，at the same time awakened to revenge．As the memory of past misfortunes pressed upon me，I began to reflect on their cause—the monster whom I had created，the miserable daemon whom I had sent abroad into the world for my destruction．I was possessed by a maddening rage when I thought of him，and desired and ardently prayed that I might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signal revenge on his cursed head．

Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes；I began to reflect on the best means of securing him；and for this purpose，about a month after my release，I repaired to a criminal judge in the town and told him that I had an accusation to make，that I knew the destroyer of my family，and that I required him to exert his whole authority for the apprehension of the murderer．

The magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness．“Be assured，sir，”said he，“no pains or exertions on my part shall be spared to discover the villain．”

“I thank you，”replied I；“listen，therefore，to the deposition that I have to make．It is indeed a tale so strange that I should fear you would not credit it were there not something in truth which，however wonderful，forces conviction．The story is too connected to be mistaken for a dream，and I have no motive for falsehood．”My manner as I thus addressed him was impressive but calm；I had formed in my own heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death，and this purpose quieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life．I now related my history briefly but with firmness and precision，marking the dates with accuracy and never deviating into invective or exclamation．

The magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous，but as I continued he became more attentive and interested；I saw him sometimes shudder with horror；at others a lively surprise，unmingled with disbelief，was painted on his countenance．

When I had concluded my narration I said，“This is the being whom I accuse and for whose seizure and punishment I call upon you to exert your whole power．It is your duty as a magistrate，and I believe and hope that your feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those functions on this occasion．”

This address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my own auditor．He had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given to a tale of spirits and supernatural events；but when he was called upon to act officially in consequence，the whole tide of his incredulity returned．He，however，answered mildly，“I would willingly afford you every aid in your pursuit，but the creature of whom you speak appears to have powers which would put all my exertions to defiance．Who can follow an animal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where no man would venture to intrude？Besides，some months have elapsed since the commission of his crimes，and no one can conjecture to what place he has wandered or what region he may now inhabit．”

“I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit，and if he has indeed taken refuge in the Alps，he may be hunted like the chamois and destroyed as a beast of prey．But I perceive your thoughts；you do not credit my narrative and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the punishment which is his desert．”

As I spoke，rage sparkled in my eyes；the magistrate was intimidated．“You are mistaken，”said he．“I will exert myself，and if it is in my power to seize the monster，be assured that he shall suffer punishment proportionate to his crimes．But I fear，from what you have yourself described to be his properties，that this will prove impracticable；and thus，while every proper measure is pursued，you should make up your mind to disappointment．”

“That cannot be；but all that I can say will be of little avail．My revenge is of no moment to you；yet，while I allow it to be a vice，I confess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul．My rage is unspeakable when I reflect that the murderer，whom I have turned loose upon society，still exists．You refuse my just demand；I have but one resource，and I devote myself，either in my life or death，to his destruction．”

I trembled with excess of agitation as I said this；there was a frenzy in my manner，and something，I doubt not，of that haughty fierceness which the martyrs of old are said to have possessed．But to a Genevan magistrate，whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of devotion and heroism，this elevation of mind had much the appearance of madness．He endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child and reverted to my tale as the effects of delirium．

“Man，”I cried，“how ignorant art thou in thy pride of wisdom！Cease；you know not what it is you say．”

I broke from the house angry and disturbed and retired to meditate on some other mode of action．





Chapter 24


My present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was swallowed up and lost．I was hurried away by fury；revenge alone endowed me with strength and composure；it moulded my feelings and allowed me to be calculating and calm at periods when otherwise delirium or death would have been my portion．

My first resolution was to quit Geneva forever；my country，which，when I was happy and beloved，was dear to me，now，in my adversity，became hateful．I provided myself with a sum of money，together with a few jewels which had belonged to my mother，and departed．

And now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life．I have traversed a vast portion of the earth and have endured all the hardships which travellers in deserts and barbarous countries are wont to meet．How I have lived I hardly know；many times have I stretched my failing limbs upon the sandy plain and prayed for death．But revenge kept me alive；I dared not die and leave my adversary in being．

When I quitted Geneva my first labour was to gain some clue by which I might trace the steps of my fiendish enemy．But my plan was unsettled，and I wandered many hours round the confines of the town，uncertain what path I should pursue．As night approached I found myself at the entrance of the cemetery where William，Elizabeth，and my father reposed．I entered it and approached the tomb which marked their graves．Everything was silent except the leaves of the trees，which were gently agitated by the wind；the night was nearly dark，and the scene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested observer．The spirits of the departed seemed to flit around and to cast a shadow，which was felt but not seen，around the head of the mourner．

The deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way to rage and despair．They were dead，and I lived；their murderer also lived，and to destroy him I must drag out my weary existence．I knelt on the grass and kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed，“By the sacred earth on which I kneel，by the shades that wander near me，by the deep and eternal grief that I feel，I swear；and by thee，O Night，and the spirits that preside over thee，to pursue the daemon who caused this misery，until he or I shall perish in mortal conflict．For this purpose I will preserve my life；to execute this dear revenge will I again behold the sun and tread the green herbage of earth，which otherwise should vanish from my eyes forever．And I call on you，spirits of the dead，and on you，wandering ministers of vengeance，to aid and conduct me in my work．Let the cursed and hellish monster drink deep of agony；let him feel the despair that now torments me．”

I had begun my adjuration with solemnity and an awe which almost assured me that the shades of my murdered friends heard and approved my devotion，but the furies possessed me as I concluded，and rage choked my utterance．

I was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish laugh．It rang on my ears long and heavily；the mountains re-echoed it，and I felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter．Surely in that moment I should have been possessed by frenzy and have destroyed my miserable existence but that my vow was heard and that I was reserved for vengeance．The laughter died away，when a well-known and abhorred voice，apparently close to my ear，addressed me in an audible whisper，“I am satisfied，miserable wretch！You have determined to live，and I am satisfied．”

I darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded，but the devil eluded my grasp．Suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose and shone full upon his ghastly and distorted shape as he fled with more than mortal speed．

I pursued him，and for many months this has been my task．Guided by a slight clue，I followed the windings of the Rhone，but vainly．The blue Mediterranean appeared，and by a strange chance，I saw the fiend enter by night and hide himself in a vessel bound for the Black Sea．I took my passage in the same ship，but he escaped，I know not how．

Amidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia，although he still evaded me，I have ever followed in his track．Sometimes the peasants，scared by this horrid apparition，informed me of his path；sometimes he himself，who feared that if I lost all trace of him I should despair and die，left some mark to guide me．The snows descended on my head，and I saw the print of his huge step on the white plain．To you first entering on life，to whom care is new and agony unknown，how can you understand what I have felt and still feel？Cold，want，and fatigue were the least pains which I was destined to endure；I was cursed by some devil and carried about with me my eternal hell；yet still a spirit of good followed and directed my steps and when I most murmured would suddenly extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties．Sometimes，when nature，overcome by hunger，sank under the exhaustion，a repast was prepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me．The fare was，indeed，coarse，such as the peasants of the country ate，but I will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that I had invoked to aid me．Often，when all was dry，the heavens cloudless，and I was parched by thirst，a slight cloud would bedim the sky，shed the few drops that revived me，and vanish．

I followed，when I could，the courses of the rivers；but the daemon generally avoided these，as it was here that the population of the country chiefly collected．In other places human beings were seldom seen，and I generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my path．I had money with me and gained the friendship of the villagers by distributing it；or I brought with me some food that I had killed，which，after taking a small part，I always presented to those who had provided me with fire and utensils for cooking．

My life，as it passed thus，was indeed hateful to me，and it was during sleep alone that I could taste joy．O blessed sleep！Often，when most miserable，I sank to repose，and my dreams lulled me even to rapture．The spirits that guarded me had provided these moments，or rather hours，of happiness that I might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage．Deprived of this respite，I should have sunk under my hardships．During the day I was sustained and inspirited by the hope of night，for in sleep I saw my friends，my wife，and my beloved country；again I saw the benevolent countenance of my father，heard the silver tones of my Elizabeth's voice，and beheld Clerval enjoying health and youth．Often，when wearied by a toilsome march，I persuaded myself that I was dreaming until night should come and that I should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest friends．What agonizing fondness did I feel for them！How did I cling to their dear forms，as sometimes they haunted even my waking hours，and persuade myself that they still lived！At such moments vengeance，that burned within me，died in my heart，and I pursued my path towards the destruction of the daemon more as a task enjoined by heaven，as the mechanical impulse of some power of which I was unconscious，than as the ardent desire of my soul．

What his feelings were whom I pursued I cannot know．Sometimes，indeed，he left marks in writing on the barks of the trees or cut in stone that guided me and instigated my fury．“My reign is not yet over”—these words were legible in one of these inscriptions—“you live，and my power is complete．Follow me；I seek the everlasting ices of the north，where you will feel the misery of cold and frost，to which I am impassive．You will find near this place，if you follow not too tardily，a dead hare；eat and be refreshed．Come on，my enemy；we have yet to wrestle for our lives，but many hard and miserable hours must you endure until that period shall arrive．”

Scoffing devil！Again do I vow vengeance；again do I devote thee，miserable fiend，to torture and death．Never will I give up my search until he or I perish；and then with what ecstasy shall I join my Elizabeth and my departed friends，who even now prepare for me the reward of my tedious toil and horrible pilgrimage！

As I still pursued my journey to the northward，the snows thickened and the cold increased in a degree almost too severe to support．The peasants were shut up in their hovels，and only a few of the most hardy ventured forth to seize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hiding-places to seek for prey．The rivers were covered with ice，and no fish could be procured；and thus I was cut off from my chief article of maintenance．

The triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours．One inscription that he left was in these words：“Prepare！Your toils only begin；wrap yourself in furs and provide food，for we shall soon enter upon a journey where your sufferings will satisfy my everlasting hatred．”

My courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words；I resolved not to fail in my purpose，and calling on heaven to support me，I continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts，until the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary of the horizon．Oh！How unlike it was to the blue seasons of the south！Covered with ice，it was only to be distinguished from land by its superior wildness and ruggedness．The Greeks wept for joy when they beheld the Mediterranean from the hills of Asia，and hailed with rapture the boundary of their toils．I did not weep，but I knelt down and with a full heart thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me in safety to the place where I hoped，notwithstanding my adversary's gibe，to meet and grapple with him．

Some weeks before this period I had procured a sledge and dogs and thus traversed the snows with inconceivable speed．I know not whether the fiend possessed the same advantages，but I found that，as before I had daily lost ground in the pursuit，I now gained on him，so much so that when I first saw the ocean he was but one day's journey in advance，and I hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach．With new courage，therefore，I pressed on，and in two days arrived at a wretched hamlet on the seashore．I inquired of the inhabitants concerning the fiend and gained accurate information．A gigantic monster，they said，had arrived the night before，armed with a gun and many pistols，putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage through fear of his terrific appearance．He had carried off their store of winter food，and placing it in a sledge，to draw which he had seized on a numerous drove of trained dogs，he had harnessed them，and the same night，to the joy of the horror-struck villagers，had pursued his journey across the sea in a direction that led to no land；and they conjectured that he must speedily be destroyed by the breaking of the ice or frozen by the eternal frosts．

On hearing this information I suffered a temporary access of despair．He had escaped me，and I must commence a destructive and almost endless journey across the mountainous ices of the ocean，amidst cold that few of the inhabitants could long endure and which I，the native of a genial and sunny climate，could not hope to survive．Yet at the idea that the fiend should live and be triumphant，my rage and vengeance returned，and like a mighty tide，overwhelmed every other feeling．After a slight repose，during which the spirits of the dead hovered round and instigated me to toil and revenge，I prepared for my journey．

I exchanged my land-sledge for one fashioned for the inequalities of the frozen ocean，and purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions，I departed from land．

I cannot guess how many days have passed since then，but I have endured misery which nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution burning within my heart could have enabled me to support．Immense and rugged mountains of ice often barred up my passage，and I often heard the thunder of the ground sea，which threatened my destruction．But again the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure．

By the quantity of provision which I had consumed，I should guess that I had passed three weeks in this journey；and the continual protraction of hope，returning back upon the heart，often wrung bitter drops of despondency and grief from my eyes．Despair had indeed almost secured her prey，and I should soon have sunk beneath this misery．Once，after the poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil gained the summit of a sloping ice mountain，and one，sinking under his fatigue，died，I viewed the expanse before me with anguish，when suddenly my eye caught a dark speck upon the dusky plain．I strained my sight to discover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when I distinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well-known form within．Oh！With what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart！Warm tears filled my eyes，which I hastily wiped away，that they might not intercept the view I had of the daemon；but still my sight was dimmed by the burning drops，until，giving way to the emotions that oppressed me，I wept aloud．

But this was not the time for delay；I disencumbered the dogs of their dead companion，gave them a plentiful portion of food，and after an hour's rest，which was absolutely necessary，and yet which was bitterly irksome to me，I continued my route．The sledge was still visible，nor did I again lose sight of it except at the moments when for a short time some ice-rock concealed it with its intervening crags．I indeed perceptibly gained on it，and when，after nearly two days' journey，I beheld my enemy at no more than a mile distant，my heart bounded within me．

But now，when I appeared almost within grasp of my foe，my hopes were suddenly extinguished，and I lost all trace of him more utterly than I had ever done before．A ground sea was heard；the thunder of its progress，as the waters rolled and swelled beneath me，became every moment more ominous and terrific．I pressed on，but in vain．The wind arose；the sea roared；and，as with the mighty shock of an earthquake，it split and cracked with a tremendous and overwhelming sound．The work was soon finished；in a few minutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy，and I was left drifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening and thus preparing for me a hideous death．

In this manner many appalling hours passed；several of my dogs died，and I myself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress when I saw your vessel riding at anchor and holding forth to me hopes of succour and life．I had no conception that vessels ever came so far north and was astounded at the sight．I quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars，and by these means was enabled，with infinite fatigue，to move my ice raft in the direction of your ship．I had determined，if you were going southwards，still to trust myself to the mercy of the seas rather than abandon my purpose．I hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which I could pursue my enemy．But your direction was northwards．You took me on board when my vigour was exhausted，and I should soon have sunk under my multiplied hardships into a death which I still dread，for my task is unfulfilled．

Oh！When will my guiding spirit，in conducting me to the daemon，allow me the rest I so much desire；or must I die，and he yet live？If I do，swear to me，Walton，that he shall not escape，that you will seek him and satisfy my vengeance in his death．And do I dare to ask of you to undertake my pilgrimage，to endure the hardships that I have undergone？No；I am not so selfish．Yet，when I am dead，if he should appear，if the ministers of vengeance should conduct him to you，swear that he shall not live—swear that he shall not triumph over my accumulated woes and survive to add to the list of his dark crimes．He is eloquent and persuasive，and once his words had even power over my heart；but trust him not．His soul is as hellish as his form，full of treachery and fiendlike malice．Hear him not；call on the names of William，Justine，Clerval，Elizabeth，my father，and of the wretched Victor，and thrust your sword into his heart．I will hover near and direct the steel aright．

Walton，in continuation．

August 26th，17—

You have read this strange and terrific story，Margaret；and do you not feel your blood congeal with horror，like that which even now curdles mine？Sometimes，seized with sudden agony，he could not continue his tale；at others，his voice broken，yet piercing，uttered with difficulty the words so replete with anguish．His fine and lovely eyes were now lighted up with indignation，now subdued to downcast sorrow and quenched in infinite wretchedness．Sometimes he commanded his countenance and tones and related the most horrible incidents with a tranquil voice，suppressing every mark of agitation；then，like a volcano bursting forth，his face would suddenly change to an expression of the wildest rage as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor．

His tale is connected and told with an appearance of the simplest truth，yet I own to you that the letters of Felix and Safie，which he showed me，and the apparition of the monster seen from our ship，brought to me a greater conviction of the truth of his narrative than his asseverations，however earnest and connected．Such a monster has，then，really existence！I cannot doubt it，yet I am lost in surprise and admiration．Sometimes I endeavoured to gain from Frankenstein the particulars of his creature's formation，but on this point he was impenetrable．

“Are you mad，my friend？”said he．“Or whither does your senseless curiosity lead you？Would you also create for yourself and the world a demoniacal enemy？Peace，peace！Learn my miseries and do not seek to increase your own．”

Frankenstein discovered that I made notes concerning his history；he asked to see them and then himself corrected and augmented them in many places，but principally in giving the life and spirit to the conversations he held with his enemy．“Since you have preserved my narration，”said he，“I would not that a mutilated one should go down to posterity．”

Thus has a week passed away，while I have listened to the strangest tale that ever imagination formed．My thoughts and every feeling of my soul have been drunk up by the interest for my guest which this tale and his own elevated and gentle manners have created．I wish to soothe him，yet can I counsel one so infinitely miserable，so destitute of every hope of consolation，to live？Oh，no！The only joy that he can now know will be when he composes his shattered spirit to peace and death．Yet he enjoys one comfort，the offspring of solitude and delirium；he believes that when in dreams he holds converse with his friends and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries or excitements to his vengeance，that they are not the creations of his fancy，but the beings themselves who visit him from the regions of a remote world．This faith gives a solemnity to his reveries that render them to me almost as imposing and interesting as truth．

Our conversations are not always confined to his own history and misfortunes．On every point of general literature he displays unbounded knowledge and a quick and piercing apprehension．His eloquence is forcible and touching；nor can I hear him，when he relates a pathetic incident or endeavours to move the passions of pity or love，without tears．What a glorious creature must he have been in the days of his prosperity，when he is thus noble and godlike in ruin！He seems to feel his own worth and the greatness of his fall．

“When younger，”said he，“I believed myself destined for some great enterprise．My feelings are profound，but I possessed a coolness of judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements．This sentiment of the worth of my nature supported me when others would have been oppressed，for I deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief those talents that might be useful to my fellow creatures．When I reflected on the work I had completed，no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rational animal，I could not rank myself with the herd of common projectors．But this thought，which supported me in the commencement of my career，now serves only to plunge me lower in the dust．All my speculations and hopes are as nothing，and like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence，I am chained in an eternal hell．My imagination was vivid，yet my powers of analysis and application were intense；by the union of these qualities I conceived the idea and executed the creation of a man．Even now I cannot recollect without passion my reveries while the work was incomplete．I trod heaven in my thoughts，now exulting in my powers，now burning with the idea of their effects．From my infancy I was imbued with high hopes and a lofty ambition；but how am I sunk！Oh！My friend，if you had known me as I once was，you would not recognize me in this state of degradation．Despondency rarely visited my heart；a high destiny seemed to bear me on，until I fell，never，never again to rise．”

Must I then lose this admirable being？I have longed for a friend；I have sought one who would sympathize with and love me．Behold，on these desert seas I have found such a one，but I fear I have gained him only to know his value and lose him．I would reconcile him to life，but he repulses the idea．

“I thank you，Walton，”he said，“for your kind intentions towards so miserable a wretch；but when you speak of new ties and fresh affections，think you that any can replace those who are gone？Can any man be to me as Clerval was，or any woman another Elizabeth？Even where the affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence，the companions of our childhood always possess a certain power over our minds which hardly any later friend can obtain．They know our infantine dispositions，which，however they may be afterwards modified，are never eradicated；and they can judge of our actions with more certain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives．A sister or a brother can never，unless indeed such symptoms have been shown early，suspect the other of fraud or false dealing，when another friend，however strongly he may be attached，may，in spite of himself，be contemplated with suspicion．But I enjoyed friends，dear not only through habit and association，but from their own merits；and wherever I am，the soothing voice of my Elizabeth and the conversation of Clerval will be ever whispered in my ear．They are dead，and but one feeling in such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my life．If I were engaged in any high undertaking or design，fraught with extensive utility to my fellow creatures，then could I live to fulfil it．But such is not my destiny；I must pursue and destroy the being to whom I gave existence；then my lot on earth will be fulfilled and I may die．”

My beloved Sister，

September 2nd

I write to you，encompassed by peril and ignorant whether I am ever doomed to see again dear England and the dearer friends that inhabit it．I am surrounded by mountains of ice which admit of no escape and threaten every moment to crush my vessel．The brave fellows whom I have persuaded to be my companions look towards me for aid，but I have none to bestow．There is something terribly appalling in our situation，yet my courage and hopes do not desert me．Yet it is terrible to reflect that the lives of all these men are endangered through me．If we are lost，my mad schemes are the cause．

And what，Margaret，will be the state of your mind？You will not hear of my destruction，and you will anxiously await my return．Years will pass，and you will have visitings of despair and yet be tortured by hope．Oh！My beloved sister，the sickening failing of your heart-felt expectations is，in prospect，more terrible to me than my own death．But you have a husband and lovely children；you may be happy．Heaven bless you and make you so！

My unfortunate guest regards me with the tenderest compassion．He endeavours to fill me with hope and talks as if life were a possession which he valued．He reminds me how often the same accidents have happened to other navigators who have attempted this sea，and in spite of myself，he fills me with cheerful auguries．Even the sailors feel the power of his eloquence；when he speaks，they no longer despair；he rouses their energies，and while they hear his voice they believe these vast mountains of ice are mole-hills which will vanish before the resolutions of man．These feelings are transitory；each day of expectation delayed fills them with fear，and I almost dread a mutiny caused by this despair．

September 5th

A scene has just passed of such uncommon interest that，although it is highly probable that these papers may never reach you，yet I cannot forbear recording it．

We are still surrounded by mountains of ice，still in imminent danger of being crushed in their conflict．The cold is excessive，and many of my unfortunate comrades have already found a grave amidst this scene of desolation．Frankenstein has daily declined in health；a feverish fire still glimmers in his eyes，but he is exhausted，and when suddenly roused to any exertion，he speedily sinks again into apparent lifelessness．

I mentioned in my last letter the fears I entertained of a mutiny．This morning，as I sat watching the wan countenance of my friend—his eyes half closed and his limbs hanging listlessly—I was roused by half a dozen of the sailors，who demanded admission into the cabin．They entered，and their leader addressed me．He told me that he and his companions had been chosen by the other sailors to come in deputation to me to make me a requisition which，in justice，I could not refuse．We were immured in ice and should probably never escape，but they feared that if，as was possible，the ice should dissipate and a free passage be opened，I should be rash enough to continue my voyage and lead them into fresh dangers，after they might happily have surmounted this．They insisted，therefore，that I should engage with a solemn promise that if the vessel should be freed I would instantly direct my course southwards．

This speech troubled me．I had not despaired，nor had I yet conceived the idea of returning if set free．Yet could I，in justice，or even in possibility，refuse this demand？I hesitated before I answered，when Frankenstein，who had at first been silent，and indeed appeared hardly to have force enough to attend，now roused himself；his eyes sparkled，and his cheeks flushed with momentary vigour．Turning towards the men，he said，“What do you mean？What do you demand of your captain？Are you，then，so easily turned from your design？Did you not call this a glorious expedition？And wherefore was it glorious？Not because the way was smooth and placid as a southern sea，but because it was full of dangers and terror，because at every new incident your fortitude was to be called forth and your courage exhibited，because danger and death surrounded it，and these you were to brave and overcome．For this was it a glorious，for this was it an honourable undertaking．You were hereafter to be hailed as the benefactors of your species，your names adored as belonging to brave men who encountered death for honour and the benefit of mankind．And now，behold，with the first imagination of danger，or，if you will，the first mighty and terrific trial of your courage，you shrink away and are content to be handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold and peril；and so，poor souls，they were chilly and returned to their warm firesides．Why，that requires not this preparation；ye need not have come thus far and dragged your captain to the shame of a defeat merely to prove yourselves cowards．Oh！Be men，or be more than men．Be steady to your purposes and firm as a rock．This ice is not made of such stuff as your hearts may be；it is mutable and cannot withstand you if you say that it shall not．Do not return to your families with the stigma of disgrace marked on your brows．Return as heroes who have fought and conquered and who know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe．”

He spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings expressed in his speech，with an eye so full of lofty design and heroism，that can you wonder that these men were moved？They looked at one another and were unable to reply．I spoke；I told them to retire and consider of what had been said，that I would not lead them farther north if they strenuously desired the contrary，but that I hoped that，with reflection，their courage would return．

They retired and I turned towards my friend，but he was sunk in languor and almost deprived of life．

How all this will terminate，I know not，but I had rather die than return shamefully，my purpose unfulfilled．Yet I fear such will be my fate；the men，unsupported by ideas of glory and honour，can never willingly continue to endure their present hardships．

September 7th

The die is cast；I have consented to return if we are not destroyed．Thus are my hopes blasted by cowardice and indecision；I come back ignorant and disappointed．It requires more philosophy than I possess to bear this injustice with patience．

September 12th

It is past；I am returning to England．I have lost my hopes of utility and glory；I have lost my friend．But I will endeavour to detail these bitter circumstances to you，my dear sister；and while I am wafted towards England and towards you，I will not despond．

September 9th，the ice began to move，and roarings like thunder were heard at a distance as the islands split and cracked in every direction．We were in the most imminent peril，but as we could only remain passive，my chief attention was occupied by my unfortunate guest whose illness increased in such a degree that he was entirely confined to his bed．The ice cracked behind us and was driven with force towards the north；a breeze sprang from the west，and on the 11th the passage towards the south became perfectly free．When the sailors saw this and that their return to their native country was apparently assured，a shout of tumultuous joy broke from them，loud and long-continued．Frankenstein，who was dozing，awoke and asked the cause of the tumult．“They shout，”I said，“because they will soon return to England．”

“Do you，then，really return？”

“Alas！Yes；I cannot withstand their demands．I cannot lead them unwillingly to danger，and I must return．”

“Do so，if you will；but I will not．You may give up your purpose，but mine is assigned to me by heaven，and I dare not．I am weak，but surely the spirits who assist my vengeance will endow me with sufficient strength．”Saying this，he endeavoured to spring from the bed，but the exertion was too great for him；he fell back and fainted．

It was long before he was restored，and I often thought that life was entirely extinct．At length he opened his eyes；he breathed with difficulty and was unable to speak．The surgeon gave him a composing draught and ordered us to leave him undisturbed．In the meantime he told me that my friend had certainly not many hours to live．

His sentence was pronounced，and I could only grieve and be patient．I sat by his bed，watching him；his eyes were closed，and I thought he slept；but presently he called to me in a feeble voice，and bidding me come near，said，“Alas！The strength I relied on is gone；I feel that I shall soon die，and he，my enemy and persecutor，may still be in being．Think not，Walton，that in the last moments of my existence I feel that burning hatred and ardent desire of revenge I once expressed；but I feel myself justified in desiring the death of my adversary．During these last days I have been occupied in examining my past conduct；nor do I find it blamable．In a fit of enthusiastic madness I created a rational creature and was bound towards him to assure，as far as was in my power，his happiness and well-being．This was my duty，but there was another still paramount to that．My duties towards the beings of my own species had greater claims to my attention because they included a greater proportion of happiness or misery．Urged by this view，I refused，and I did right in refusing，to create a companion for the first creature．He showed unparalleled malignity and selfishness in evil；he destroyed my friends；he devoted to destruction beings who possessed exquisite sensations，happiness，and wisdom；nor do I know where this thirst for vengeance may end．Miserable himself that he may render no other wretched，he ought to die．The task of his destruction was mine，but I have failed．When actuated by selfish and vicious motives，I asked you to undertake my unfinished work，and I renew this request now，when I am only induced by reason and virtue．

“Yet I cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends to fulfil this task；and now that you are returning to England，you will have little chance of meeting with him．But the consideration of these points，and the well balancing of what you may esteem your duties，I leave to you；my judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near approach of death．I dare not ask you to do what I think right，for I may still be misled by passion．

“That he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me；in other respects，this hour，when I momentarily expect my release，is the only happy one which I have enjoyed for several years．The forms of the beloved dead flit before me，and I hasten to their arms．Farewell，Walton！Seek happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition，even if it be only the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in science and discoveries．Yet why do I say this？I have myself been blasted in these hopes，yet another may succeed．”

His voice became fainter as he spoke，and at length，exhausted by his effort，he sank into silence．About half an hour afterwards he attempted again to speak but was unable；he pressed my hand feebly，and his eyes closed forever，while the irradiation of a gentle smile passed away from his lips．

Margaret，what comment can I make on the untimely extinction of this glorious spirit？What can I say that will enable you to understand the depth of my sorrow？All that I should express would be inadequate and feeble．My tears flow；my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of disappointment．But I journey towards England，and I may there find consolation．

I am interrupted．What do these sounds portend？It is midnight；the breeze blows fairly，and the watch on deck scarcely stir．Again there is a sound as of a human voice，but hoarser；it comes from the cabin where the remains of Frankenstein still lie．I must arise and examine．Good night，my sister．

Great God！what a scene has just taken place！I am yet dizzy with the remembrance of it．I hardly know whether I shall have the power to detail it；yet the tale which I have recorded would be incomplete without this final and wonderful catastrophe．

I entered the cabin where lay the remains of my ill-fated and admirable friend．Over him hung a form which I cannot find words to describe—gigantic in stature，yet uncouth and distorted in its proportions．As he hung over the coffin，his face was concealed by long locks of ragged hair；but one vast hand was extended，in colour and apparent texture like that of a mummy．When he heard the sound of my approach，he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and horror and sprung towards the window．Never did I behold a vision so horrible as his face，of such loathsome yet appalling hideousness．I shut my eyes involuntarily and endeavoured to recollect what were my duties with regard to this destroyer．I called on him to stay．

He paused，looking on me with wonder，and again turning towards the lifeless form of his creator，he seemed to forget my presence，and every feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some uncontrollable passion．

“That is also my victim！”he exclaimed．“In his murder my crimes are consummated；the miserable series of my being is wound to its close！Oh，Frankenstein！Generous and self-devoted being！What does it avail that I now ask thee to pardon me？I，who irretrievably destroyed thee by destroying all thou lovedst．Alas！He is cold，he cannot answer me．”

His voice seemed suffocated，and my first impulses，which had suggested to me the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend in destroying his enemy，were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion．I approached this tremendous being；I dared not again raise my eyes to his face，there was something so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness．I attempted to speak，but the words died away on my lips．The monster continued to utter wild and incoherent self-reproaches．At length I gathered resolution to address him in a pause of the tempest of his passion．“Your repentance，”I said，“is now superfluous．If you had listened to the voice of conscience and heeded the stings of remorse before you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity，Frankenstein would yet have lived．”

“And do you dream？”said the daemon．“Do you think that I was then dead to agony and remorse？He，”he continued，pointing to the corpse，“he suffered not in the consummation of the deed．Oh！Not the ten-thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the lingering detail of its execution．A frightful selfishness hurried me on，while my heart was poisoned with remorse．Think you that the groans of Clerval were music to my ears？My heart was fashioned to be susceptible of love and sympathy，and when wrenched by misery to vice and hatred，it did not endure the violence of the change without torture such as you cannot even imagine．

“After the murder of Clerval I returned to Switzerland，heart-broken and overcome．I pitied Frankenstein；my pity amounted to horror；I abhorred myself．But when I discovered that he，the author at once of my existence and of its unspeakable torments，dared to hope for happiness，that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me he sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the indulgence of which I was forever barred，then impotent envy and bitter indignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance．I recollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished．I knew that I was preparing for myself a deadly torture，but I was the slave，not the master，of an impulse which I detested yet could not disobey．Yet when she died！Nay，then I was not miserable．I had cast off all feeling，subdued all anguish，to riot in the excess of my despair．Evil thenceforth became my good．Urged thus far，I had no choice but to adapt my nature to an element which I had willingly chosen．The completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiable passion．And now it is ended；there is my last victim！”

I was at first touched by the expressions of his misery；yet，when I called to mind what Frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence and persuasion，and when I again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my friend，indignation was rekindled within me．“Wretch！”I said．“It is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you have made．You throw a torch into a pile of buildings，and when they are consumed，you sit among the ruins and lament the fall．Hypocritical fiend！If he whom you mourn still lived，still would he be the object，again would he become the prey，of your accursed vengeance．It is not pity that you feel；you lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn from your power．”

“Oh，it is not thus—not thus，”interrupted the being．“Yet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to be the purport of my actions．Yet I seek not a fellow feeling in my misery．No sympathy may I ever find．When I first sought it，it was the love of virtue，the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole being overflowed，that I wished to be participated．But now that virtue has become to me a shadow，and that happiness and affection are turned into bitter and loathing despair，in what should I seek for sympathy？I am content to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure；when I die，I am well satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory．Once my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue，of fame，and of enjoyment．Once I falsely hoped to meet with beings who，pardoning my outward form，would love me for the excellent qualities which I was capable of unfolding．I was nourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion．But now crime has degraded me beneath the meanest animal．No guilt，no mischief，no malignity，no misery，can be found comparable to mine．When I run over the frightful catalogue of my sins，I cannot believe that I am the same creature whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendent visions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness．But it is even so；the fallen angel becomes a malignant devil．Yet even that enemy of God and man had friends and associates in his desolation；I am alone．

“You，who call Frankenstein your friend，seem to have a knowledge of my crimes and his misfortunes．But in the detail which he gave you of them he could not sum up the hours and months of misery which I endured wasting in impotent passions．For while I destroyed his hopes，I did not satisfy my own desires．They were forever ardent and craving；still I desired love and fellowship，and I was still spurned．Was there no injustice in this？Am I to be thought the only criminal，when all humankind sinned against me？Why do you not hate Felix，who drove his friend from his door with contumely？Why do you not execrate the rustic who sought to destroy the saviour of his child？Nay，these are virtuous and immaculate beings！I，the miserable and the abandoned，am an abortion，to be spurned at，and kicked，and trampled on．Even now my blood boils at the recollection of this injustice．

“But it is true that I am a wretch．I have murdered the lovely and the helpless；I have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped to death his throat who never injured me or any other living thing．I have devoted my creator，the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and admiration among men，to misery；I have pursued him even to that irremediable ruin．There he lies，white and cold in death．You hate me，but your abhorrence cannot equal that with which I regard myself．I look on the hands which executed the deed；I think on the heart in which the imagination of it was conceived and long for the moment when these hands will meet my eyes，when that imagination will haunt my thoughts no more．

“Fear not that I shall be the instrument of future mischief．My work is nearly complete．Neither yours nor any man's death is needed to consummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be done，but it requires my own．Do not think that I shall be slow to perform this sacrifice．I shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which brought me thither and shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe；I shall collect my funeral pile and consume to ashes this miserable frame，that its remains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch who would create such another as I have been．I shall die．I shall no longer feel the agonies which now consume me or be the prey of feelings unsatisfied，yet unquenched．He is dead who called me into being；and when I shall be no more，the very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish．I shall no longer see the sun or stars or feel the winds play on my cheeks．Light，feeling，and sense will pass away；and in this condition must I find my happiness．Some years ago，when the images which this world affords first opened upon me，when I felt the cheering warmth of summer and heard the rustling of the leaves and the warbling of the birds，and these were all to me，I should have wept to die；now it is my only consolation．Polluted by crimes and torn by the bitterest remorse，where can I find rest but in death？

“Farewell！I leave you，and in you the last of humankind whom these eyes will ever behold．Farewell，Frankenstein！If thou wert yet alive and yet cherished a desire of revenge against me，it would be better satiated in my life than in my destruction．But it was not so；thou didst seek my extinction，that I might not cause greater wretchedness；and if yet，in some mode unknown to me，thou hadst not ceased to think and feel，thou wouldst not desire against me a vengeance greater than that which I feel．Blasted as thou wert，my agony was still superior to thine，for the bitter sting of remorse will not cease to rankle in my wounds until death shall close them forever．

“But soon，”he cried with sad and solemn enthusiasm，“I shall die，and what I now feel be no longer felt．Soon these burning miseries will be extinct．I shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly and exult in the agony of the torturing flames．The light of that conflagration will fade away；my ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds．My spirit will sleep in peace，or if it thinks，it will not surely think thus．Farewell．”

He sprang from the cabin window as he said this，upon the ice raft which lay close to the vessel．He was soon borne away by the waves and lost in darkness and distance．
