第一章　双份波旁威士忌引发的反思


喝下了两杯双份波旁威士忌，詹姆斯·邦德坐在迈阿密机场候机室思考着生与死的问题。

杀人是他职业生涯的一部分，但他从来都不喜欢。如果他迫不得已要杀人，之后也懂得怎么去忘记。在特工界，拥有双O头衔(1)意味着拥有杀人的权力，作为少数拥有这一头衔的特工之一，他必须做到像一名外科医生一样冷静地看待死亡。死了就是死了，懊悔这种情绪对于特工来说，不仅是非常不专业的表现，甚至可以称作灵魂的蛀虫。

然而，有关那个墨西哥人的死亡，人们既好奇又关注。这并不是说他不应该死，而且他是个恶人，墨西哥人管他这种人叫“卡彭高”(2)。当然，如果杀掉邦德，他所得的报酬很可能不止这个数。从他的容貌来看，他一生中可能都充当了一个痛苦与不幸的工具。没错，一定是他的死期到了；但是当邦德杀死他的时候，也就是不到二十四小时之前，生命从这个躯体中消失得如此迅速，如此决绝。当时，邦德似乎看到他的灵魂化作一只鸟的形状，从他的口中飞出，一如海地土著居民的原始传说。

生与死之间当然是天壤之别。一个人活得好好的，说没就没了。本来这个墨西哥人有名有姓，有居住地址，有工作卡，甚至可能还有驾照。可突然之间他就命丧黄泉，只剩下血肉的躯壳和廉价的衣物，静静地躺在那里，仿佛一只空空的纸包装袋子，等待垃圾车来把它收走。而对邦德来说，从这个臭名昭著的墨西哥匪徒躯壳里消失的灵魂所带来的感触，比所有墨西哥人的生死都显得更加令人深思。

邦德低头看了看自己的杀人武器——他的右手。右手上的割伤边缘红肿，很快就会变得瘀青。他蜷起右手，用左手轻轻地揉捏。在乘飞机离开的旅途中，他每隔一会儿就重复一次这样的动作。伤手揉捏起来很疼，但这样能促进血液循环，加速伤口愈合。谁知道这只手什么时候又会被当作武器使用呢？邦德的嘴角浮现了一丝玩世不恭的微笑。

“国家航空‘星星航空公司’提醒您：飞往纽约拉瓜迪亚机场的NA106次航班马上就要起飞了，请旅客朋友们从七号登机口登机。”

机场的广播随着“咔嗒”一声关闭了。邦德低头看了看表。离下一班飞往美国本土的航班登机提示至少还有10分钟。他向服务员示意再来一杯加冰的双份波旁威士忌。矮粗的酒杯端了上来，邦德端起来晃了晃，冰块和酒更好地融合在了一起，送到嘴边，一口吞下了半杯。他捻灭烟头，坐了下来，左手托着下巴，忧郁地望着停机坪那头——半个夕阳正绚丽地缓缓滑向港湾深处。

这个墨西哥人的死给这次糟糕的任务画上了句号。这次任务既肮脏又危险，除了可以让他离开总部以外，几乎没有任何可取之处。

墨西哥的某位大人物拥有一片罂粟种植园。这里种植的花儿不是用来观赏，而是用以制作鸦片的。在墨西哥城的一家名为“可可马德雷”的小咖啡馆里，这些鸦片以相对低廉的价格飞速地卖了出去。这个小咖啡馆受到了足够的庇护。如果想要享用鸦片，你只需要走进去，要求他们加点到你要的饮品中就行了，买单的时候收银员自然会告诉你消费的金额。这本是很有秩序的商业活动，在墨西哥以外不会有人关心。然而，在遥远的英国，政府受到了联合国的敦促，要打击毒品走私，并且宣布海洛因将在英国禁售。这个禁令不仅触犯了伦敦的索霍区——一个酒吧聚集地，甚至也影响到了一些想要拯救患者于痛苦之中的德高望重的医生。禁毒令触发了一系列的犯罪，很快，由于非法毒品在英格兰的大量囤积，从中国、意大利和土耳其的常规走私渠道几乎都被截断。

在墨西哥城，有一位说话率直的进出口商人，名叫布莱克威尔。他有一个家住英格兰的姐姐，正是一名瘾君子。他爱她，也为她感到难过。当姐姐在信中写道，如果没有人帮助她肯定会死的时候，他对此深信不疑，并开始着手寻找在墨西哥的非法毒品走私。一个偶然的机会，通过朋友以及朋友的朋友，他知道了可可马德雷这个小咖啡馆，并由此找到了那名墨西哥的大毒品种植商。在这个过程中，他逐渐对贸易经济有了一定的了解。他认为，如果他能在发财的同时又解救了那些因毒品而受苦的人们，那么他毫无疑问是实现了他的人生意义。布莱克威尔本来是做化肥生意的。他拥有一个仓库，一个小工厂，三名负责检测土壤和进行植物研究的工作人员。他轻而易举地说服这个大种植商相信，在化肥生意的掩护之下，他的团队可以秘密地做从鸦片中提炼海洛因的营生。于是这位墨西哥种植商很快帮他安排好了将毒品运送到英格兰的渠道。每趟运送的毒品价值约合一千英镑，价钱公道。每个月外交部的某位外交信使都额外携带一个行李箱到伦敦，并将它寄存在维多利亚车站左边的行李寄存处，然后将寄存凭证邮寄给伦敦西中一区布克思恩皮克斯有限公司的一个名叫施瓦布的人，箱子里面的东西价值两万英镑。

然而，施瓦布算不上一个好人，对受苦之人、人道主义之类的从来都是无动于衷。他认为，既然美国的少年犯们每年可以消耗掉价值数百万美元的海洛因，那英国的“阿飞”和姑娘们当然也没问题。在位于皮姆利科的两间小屋里，他的工人正在把健胃散混进海洛因中将之进行稀释，然后再把加工后的海洛因送到歌舞厅和各种娱乐场所。

英国刑事调查局的幽灵小队开始调查他时，施瓦布已经发了一笔财。由于要调查他的供货来源，伦敦警察厅打算让他暂且再多赚一点。他们给他安了一个“亲密的尾巴”，追踪到了维多利亚车站，进而也就发现了墨西哥外交信使的秘密。事已至此，由于涉及了其他国家，英国情报局也被牵扯进来，邦德受命调查信使的供货来源并破坏他的进货渠道。

邦德领命而行，乘坐飞机飞往了墨西哥城，并且很快找到了那家名叫可可马德雷的咖啡馆。随后，他冒充伦敦的大买家，得以与那位墨西哥的大种植商建立了联系。种植商亲切地接待了他，并把他引荐给了布莱克威尔。邦德虽然对布莱克威尔的姐姐并不了解，但他对布莱克威尔却颇有好感。但这个人显然是个外行，他对英格兰禁毒令的痛恨真切无比。一天晚上，邦德潜入了他的仓库，留下一枚铝燃烧弹，然后从容地坐在一英里外的咖啡馆里，看那熊熊的火焰蹿上屋顶，听那响着警铃的消防车呼啸而过。第二天一早，他拨通了布莱克威尔的电话。开口说话前，他先将一块手帕蒙在了话筒上：

“对于你昨晚的损失我深表遗憾，你昨晚损失的研究用的土壤恐怕保险公司不会赔偿吧？”

“谁？你是谁？”

“我是从英国来的，你仓库里的那些东西已经要了那里不少年轻人的命了，也毁掉了不少人的生活。桑托斯不会再带着他的外交邮袋来英国了，施瓦布今晚就得进监狱。你见过的那个名叫邦德的家伙也难逃法网，已经遭到警察的追捕了。”

电话那头传来的声音证明对方吓坏了。

“好吧，别再干这样的勾当了，老老实实做你的肥料生意吧！”

邦德挂断了电话。

布莱克威尔当然没那么聪明，但是显然大种植商看出了破绽。邦德警惕地更换了他入住的旅馆，尽管如此，有一天晚上，邦德在科帕卡巴纳喝完最后一杯酒走在回旅馆的路上时，一个人突然拦住了他的去路。

这个人穿着一件肮脏的白色亚麻西装，戴了一顶白色的司机帽，这顶帽子对他的头来说大得出奇。阿兹台克人特有的高颧骨在他脸上留下了深蓝色的阴影。一个嘴角叼着一根牙签，另一个嘴角里叼着一根香烟。从眯成两条缝的眼睛来看，这个人刚刚吸过大麻。

“要女人吗？找找乐子吧？”

“不要！”

“土生土长的印第安女郎要吗？漂亮的丛林女郎要不要？”

“不要！”

“先看看照片怎么样？”

这个人的手伸进外套的动作对邦德来说真是再熟悉不过了。邦德断定这动作里带有他习以为常的危险气息。果然，这人的手从外套中拔出的同时，一道银光直逼邦德的喉咙。由于早有准备，邦德站在那儿稳如泰山。

邦德几乎是下意识地使出了他在书上学过的“防下手插竿式”——首先抬起右臂遮挡，同时转身，两人的前臂在半空中相遇，冲击之下，墨西哥人拿刀的手偏离了目标，同时他的防御也被打开了一个突破口，使邦德得以用左臂对准他的下巴给了狠狠一击。邦德的手腕僵硬，挥掌距离并不远，也就大概两英尺吧，但是由于僵硬而咔咔作响的掌根部位随后而至，打在墨西哥人的下巴上，力道强劲。这一击，几乎将这个墨西哥人撂倒在人行道上。或许这一掌已经打断了这个墨西哥人的脖子，足以结果了他的性命。然而当时他并没有立刻断气，还摇摇晃晃地挣扎着站了起来。这时邦德已经挥动了右手，狠狠地一拳打在他直挺挺的脖子的侧面。这一拳正中他喉结的侧面，并且邦德手指上还带着突击队必备的刀片，即使这个墨西哥人先前还有一口气，那么这次在他倒地之前也肯定已经一命呜呼了。

邦德在原地站了一会儿，让自己起伏的胸口平静下来。他低头看了看掉落在尘土里已经弄皱了的廉价衣服，又扫视了一下街道的前前后后，一个人也没有。偶尔有一辆汽车开过。打斗时也许有人经过，但看到的也只是些模模糊糊的影子。邦德屈膝蹲下，摸了摸这个墨西哥人的脉搏，发现早已没有了生命的迹象，之前由于吸了大麻而闪闪发光的眼睛也已经呆滞无神了。这个墨西哥人先前住的房子也空了，房客都逃得无影无踪。

邦德把尸体搬到了靠墙边光线更暗的地方，再用手摸索着整理了一下身上，确认自己的衣服整洁，领带笔挺，然后回到了他下榻的旅馆。

黎明时分，邦德匆匆起床，洗漱完毕，驱车前往机场，准备乘飞机尽快离开墨西哥。第一班离开墨西哥的飞机刚好是飞往委内瑞拉的首都加拉加斯的，于是邦德登上了这班飞机，而后在加拉加斯转乘了国家航空“星星航空公司”飞往迈阿密的班机。到达迈阿密之后，只要继续乘坐该航空公司的其他班机他当天晚上就能到达纽约。

然而，在迈阿密的机场等待转乘的时候，机场的广播又响了起来：“旅客朋友们，由于机械故障，飞往纽约的TR618次航班晚点，国家航空对此深表歉意。飞机预计起飞时间为明天早晨8点。请各位乘坐该航班的旅客朋友到国家航空公司的票务柜台报到，他们将为您安排住宿事宜。谢谢！”

又是这样！是应该转乘另一架飞机还是留在迈阿密过夜呢？邦德犹豫着，几乎连他的酒也给忘记了。他端起酒杯，头微微后仰，将杯中的波旁威士忌一饮而尽。杯子里的冰块碰在他的牙齿上，发出轻快的声响。好，那就这样吧！就在迈阿密过夜，在这儿喝个一醉方休。最好喝到烂醉如泥，然后随便找个什么女人把他扶到床上。他已经很多年没有喝醉过了，这个机会正是千载难逢。正值情绪低落，这个夜晚对他来说无疑是一个放松逃避的良机，所以他要尽情享受。他打算适当放纵自己一下。一直以来，他都沉浸在过度的紧张和自省之中。真不明白自己他妈的在干什么，为这么一个素不相识的墨西哥人感到忧伤，为这么一个受命来杀他的“卡彭高”？这种情况下，不是被杀就得杀人。不管用何种方式，人们总在杀人，全世界的人都是如此。比如有人飞驰的车轮可以夺取别人的生命，有人一个喷嚏将细菌喷到别人脸上，从而将自己携带的传染病毒四处传播，有人忘了关厨房里的煤气阀门，有人则任由他们车库里的一氧化碳泉涌般喷出。再比如，从下井开采的矿工到持有煤矿股份的股东，有多少人直接或间接地参与了氢弹制造的过程呢？这世界上究竟有没有一个人能够不以任何一种方式危害他的邻居呢？

夕阳的最后一线光芒终于消失在了浓浓的夜幕之中。在靛蓝的天空下，飞机跑道两边亮起了黄绿相间的闪光灯，停机坪油亮亮的地面上都能看到这些灯光的倒影。随着一声震耳欲聋的轰鸣，一架DC7猛地坠落在飞机跑道上。转机休息室的窗户受到冲击“咯咯”作响。人们都争相站起来过去观望。邦德仔细观察着这些人的面部表情。他们是希望飞机坠毁吗？这样他们就有热闹可看，有话题可谈，正好可以填补生活里的空虚了。或者，他们希望飞机平安无事。他们希望飞机上的60名乘客怎么样呢？是活着还是死了呢？

邦德的嘴角垂了下来，强制自己将这些乱七八糟的想法从大脑里清理出去。不能再有这么多近乎病态的想法了。“都是这肮脏的任务惹的祸，”邦德反思着，“你太陈腐了，厌倦了自己不得不扮演的硬汉的角色。你只是需要一个改变。你目睹了太多的死亡。你只是希望自己的生活哪怕有一丝的轻松，柔情，高尚。”

这时，邦德听到身后有脚步声越来越近，最后在他身侧停了下来。他抬头一看，是一个衣着干净整洁的中年男子，看起来生活富足，脸上的表情略带尴尬，又有点自谦。

“不好意思，您是邦德先生吧？嗯……詹姆斯·邦德先生，对吗？”

第二章　不孚众望


邦德通常喜欢隐名埋姓，因此这样被一个陌生人认了出来，他略微感到有点沮丧：“是的，我是。”

“呵呵，真是太巧了。”这名中年男子朝邦德伸出了手，邦德慢慢抬起手，轻轻握了一下，然后很快就松开了。男子的手软软的。怎么形容呢？像是一包手形的泥浆，又像是一只充气的橡胶手套。“我叫杜邦，尤尼乌斯·杜邦。我们以前见过面，但我想您已经不记得我了吧。不介意我坐下吧？”

这张脸看着好面熟，名字听着也耳熟。没错，它们勾起了邦德曾经熟悉的一些记忆。那是很久以前了，不是在美国。在试着了解这个人的同时，邦德努力地在记忆里搜索着。杜邦看起来大概五十来岁，面色红润，胡须刮得干干净净，穿着打扮含蓄低调——正是身上穿的布鲁克斯兄弟品牌服装一贯的不张扬的风格。他身穿单排扣的深咖啡色的花呢套装，内衬一件低领的白色丝绸衬衫。衣领下翻着，领口处别了一枚金色的安全别针，领带的颜色是深红和蓝色细条纹相间，与近卫旅的领带相差无几。衬衫的袖口比外套的袖口长出半寸，因此衬衫袖口上饰有微型鳟鱼钮牌的水晶原石装饰链子露了出来。脚上穿着炭灰色的袜子，鞋子有点旧了，被擦成了赤褐色。手上拿着的一顶窄边小礼帽，上面装饰着深红色的宽丝带。

杜邦在邦德对面坐了下来，递过一支烟和一只外观朴素的金色Zippo打火机。邦德注意到他有点微微出汗。邦德断定，正如自己先前的判断，杜邦是个非常有钱的美国人，此刻稍微有点尴尬。邦德知道自己以前肯定见过他，但却想不起来到底是在什么时间什么地点见过。

“来支烟吧？”

“谢谢。”他递过来的是一支国会牌香烟。邦德假装没注意到他递过来的打火机。他不喜欢用别人的打火机。他拿出了自己的，点燃了香烟。

“皇家水域51号，”杜邦目光急切地望着邦德。“那个娱乐城。埃塞尔，那是我的夫人。那天晚上你跟那个法国人大赌一场的时候，我就坐在你旁边。”

邦德的记忆忽地回到了那天晚上。对，没错，杜邦夫妇在当晚玩百家乐的时候是坐的4号和5号的位置。而邦德正是坐的6号的位置。这对夫妻看起来不是什么坏人。邦德当时很乐意有这样一个“堡垒”坐在他的左手。此刻，当晚的场景一下全部呈现在他的眼前——牌桌的绿呢台面上强烈的灯光，迅速伸到桌子对面抓牌的粉红肤色的手。邦德仿佛闻到了当时强烈的烟味和自己身上的汗味，那真是个愉快的夜晚啊！想到这里，邦德微笑着看了看对面的杜邦：“对，我当然记得。原谅我回忆得慢了点。那天晚上玩得真是开心啊，我完全沉浸在打牌带来的快乐里了。”

杜邦也对他笑了笑，脸上的表情愉快，好像松了一口气似的。“天啊，别这么说，邦德先生，我当然能理解。希望你能原谅我的冒昧，你看……”他摇了摇铃，叫来了服务员，“咱们得喝一杯庆祝一下，您要什么酒？”

“多谢。波旁威士忌加冰。”

“我要海格兑合威士忌，再来一杯水。”

服务员离开之后，杜邦身子前倾，面露微笑。一股香气从桌子对面扑面而来，像是香皂或是须后水的味儿，又或许是蓝色瑞克香水。“我就知道肯定是你。我第一眼看见你坐在那儿就认出来了。但是我对自己说，尤尼乌斯，你确实不怎么认错人，但是为什么不去确认一下呢？呵呵，我本来今晚要乘坐国家航空的班机，广播里说飞机延误的时候，我注意到了您脸上的表情。请原谅我的冒昧，邦德先生，从您脸上的表情断定，您肯定也是打算乘坐国家航空的航班吧！”邦德点头。他继续急切地说：“所以我就赶到票务柜台查看了一下旅客名单。果然没错，就是您，詹姆斯·邦德。”

杜邦身体后倾，为他的聪明感到欣喜无比。这时，酒来了。他举起酒杯，说：“为您的健康干杯！今天真是我的幸运日！”

邦德不置可否地淡淡一笑，端起酒杯喝了一口。

杜邦又把身子向前凑了过来。他朝四周看了看，附近几桌都没有人，但他还是压低了嗓音：“估计您心里一定在琢磨吧？能与尤尼乌斯·杜邦重逢我也很高兴，但是他今晚看到我为什么会这么兴奋呢？这到底是怎么回事呢？”说这话的时候，杜邦眉毛上扬，好像扮演着邦德的角色。邦德脸上显现出一副礼貌的询问的表情。杜邦身子又往前探了探。“现在，我得请求您的谅解，邦德先生，我不是那种喜欢窥探别人秘……呃……私事的人。但是，自从那晚在皇家水域相逢之后，我听说您不仅是个赌场的大玩家，而且……呃……怎么说呢？您是做某种……呃……调查工作的。就是……情报机关的特工。”听了杜邦的话，邦德的脸顿时涨得通红。杜邦身子后倾，拿出手帕，擦了擦额头，神情紧张地看着邦德。

邦德耸了耸肩。尽管有些尴尬，但他的目光变得冷酷而警惕。他努力表现出坦率、自嘲和自谦的神情，用他灰蓝色的眼睛直视着杜邦的双眼，说：“我确实做过那营生，不过时间不长，战后就不干了。现在还有人觉得干这一行挺有意思，但是在和平年代这没什么前途。”

“小声点儿！小声点儿！”杜邦挥手把自己手里的烟头扔掉。在他问下一个问题时，他的眼睛故意避开了邦德的目光，好像在等待邦德编造的下一个谎言。

邦德心想，这个人的衣服上有着狼形的装饰，肯定是个阴险狡诈之辈。

“那您现在已经转行安定下来了？”杜邦脸上露出了父亲般慈爱的微笑，“如果您不介意的话，能问问您现在从事哪一行吗？”

“进出口业务，我现在在环球出口公司，说不定您跟我们公司打过交道吧？”

杜邦没有揭穿邦德，继续说道：“嗯，环球公司啊。我想想，是，我听说过。虽然没跟他们合作过，但是现在谈合作也为时不晚。”他咯咯地笑着，说：“我做生意可以说是爱好广泛，我唯一不感兴趣的就是做化学制品生意，坦白讲，这一行不是我的幸运星。所以，邦德先生，我肯定不做化学制品的买卖。”

邦德断定，这个人对自己的一切都相当满意，因此，邦德没有对他刚才的话作出任何评价。他看了看表，想借这个动作催促杜邦快点结束他耍弄的把戏。同时，他也审视了一下自己的言行。杜邦长着一张慈善的娃娃脸，肤色粉红，女性化的嘴角有点下垂，旁边有一些细细的皱纹。从外表看，和善而不构成任何威胁，跟手拿相机站在白金汉宫门外的普通美国中年男子没什么两样。但是，邦德感觉到，在这副古板的外表之下，一定隐藏着某种冷酷狡猾的特质。

杜邦敏锐的目光捕捉到了邦德看表的动作，他也低头看了看自己的表。“哎哟，天啊！都7点了！你看我，说了半天还没说到重点。你看，邦德先生，我有件事想请您指点。如果您愿意的话，我希望能占用您一点时间，如果您打算今晚住在迈阿密，请允许我为您做东，我将不胜荣幸。”杜邦抬起手说，“我保证您在这儿度过一个舒服的夜晚。正好我在这儿拥有一家佛罗丽迪亚娜旗下的酒店。您可能也听说过吧？我们是圣诞节前后开业的，到目前为止业务还不错。那家又小又旧的蓝泉酒店完全不是我们的对手。”杜邦放声大笑。“我们这家酒店取名叫枫丹白露酒店。邦德先生，您觉得怎么样？如果您愿意下榻，我愿意让那些腰缠万贯的顾客为您腾出最好的套房。您一定得帮我这个忙。”杜邦的脸上一副恳求的表情。

邦德心里已经做好应承下来的打算。随便杜邦要求他做什么吧，是绑架，帮派恩怨，还是女人问题，这些都是有钱人经常遇到的麻烦。这些对他来说都是小菜一碟，所以就做吧。邦德开始说一些礼貌的自谦的话，结果被杜邦打断了：“邦德先生，真的，真的，请相信我，我非常感激，真的非常感激。”他打了个响指把服务员叫了过来，然后转身背对邦德把账单付了。像很多有钱人一样，他也认为让别人看他的钱，让别人看他给了多少小费等于是在炫富。他把钱包塞回裤子侧袋里（有钱人通常不用他们的裤子后袋），然后挽起了邦德的胳膊。然而他马上感觉到了邦德的不情愿，于是把手松开了，两个人一起下楼走到了大厅。

“咱们先处理你的预约问题。”杜邦走向国家航空票务柜台，仅仅三言两语杜邦就显示出他在自己势力范围里的权威。

“好的，杜邦先生。没问题，杜邦先生。我会来处理的，杜邦先生。”

门外，一辆锃亮的克莱斯勒帝国轿车停在路边。一名身穿浅棕色制服、长相凶狠的司机赶紧打开了车门。邦德上了车，在软软的椅垫上舒服地坐了下来。车里比较凉爽，甚至让人觉得有点冷。国家航空的工作人员匆忙地把邦德的行李拎了出来，交给司机，然后鞠了一躬，返回到了机场大厅。杜邦对司机说了一句：“去比尔沙滩海鲜馆。”车很快穿过了拥挤的停车场，驶上了林荫大道。

杜邦身子靠在座椅靠背上，说：“希望您爱吃雪蟹，邦德先生，您以前吃过吧？”

邦德回答说吃过，而且非常喜欢。

一路上，杜邦都在谈论着比尔沙滩海鲜馆，以及雪蟹和阿拉斯加蟹口味上的区别。克莱斯勒帝国穿过了迈阿密市区，沿着比斯坎大道行驶，又沿道格拉斯·麦克阿瑟堤道跨越了比斯坎海湾。邦德与杜邦一直礼貌而谦和地交谈着，尽情享受着速度、舒适以及友好的交谈带来的愉悦。

他们在临街的一座建筑前停了下来，这座建筑的墙粉刷成了白色，并且装饰了护墙板。墙上的粉红色霓虹灯滚动字幕写着：比尔沙滩海鲜馆。几乎在邦德下车的同时，杜邦吩咐他的司机：“把阿罗哈套房留出来。如果有什么事，请告诉费尔利先生把电话打到这里找我，好吧？”

他们拾阶而上，走进了餐馆。里面空间很大，墙壁刷成白色，窗上装饰着粉红色的穆斯林窗饰。餐桌上方亮着粉色的灯光。这餐馆人气很旺，里面挤满了皮肤晒得黝黑的人。他们身穿昂贵的热带服饰——衬衫华丽无比、身上佩戴的金饰叮叮作响。深色的太阳镜边缘镶有宝石、当地特色的草帽精致漂亮。餐馆里空气有点污浊，夹杂着一股人的身体整日沐浴在日光中的气味。

比尔，一个有点女性化的意大利人，朝他们匆匆走了过来：“哪阵风把您吹来了，杜邦先生？真是荣幸之至啊。今晚人有点多，我马上给您安排好位置，您这边请。”比尔将一本皮革封面的菜单高高举过头顶，从众多食客中间蜿蜒通过，走到了餐馆里最好的餐桌旁边。那是一张可容六人的餐桌。他麻利地拉出两把椅子，然后摇响摇铃叫来餐厅领班和斟酒的服务员，并将两本菜单摊开放到两位贵宾面前，与杜邦互致问候之后才离开。

杜邦将邦德的菜单合上，说：“您让我来代劳点菜吧！如果哪道菜不合您的口味，我们再退掉。”然后转头对领班说：“雪蟹，不要冷冻的，要新鲜的。牛油溶液，还有厚片土司，好吧？”

“好的，杜邦先生。”领班离开之后，斟酒的服务员马上洗手并走了过来。

“两品脱玫瑰香槟、50年的博瑞香槟还有白银啤酒，好吧？”

“好的，杜邦先生。先来份鸡尾酒吗？”

杜邦转头看了看邦德。邦德朝他抬了抬眉毛，微笑了一下。

邦德说：“一杯伏特加马蒂尼，加一片柠檬。”

“给我也来一杯，”杜邦说，“要双份的。”

斟酒服务员急匆匆地退了下去。杜邦身子向后靠在椅背上，拿出了香烟和打火机。他环顾一下四周，朝一两个向他挥手致意的人微笑着抬了抬手作为回应，又扫视了一下临近的几桌。他拉动自己的椅子向邦德凑近一点，抱歉地说：“就是有点太吵了。但是吃蟹这里最好，这世界上简直无人能比。但愿您不会对蟹过敏吧！上次带一个姑娘过来吃蟹，结果吃完她的嘴唇肿得像自行车轮胎一样。”

见面之初，杜邦不苟言笑，并且用高额的酬劳来吸引邦德，而现在，又这样轻松活泼地与他聊天，邦德觉得他的这种转变相当有趣。现在的他跟机场那个恳求邦德帮忙的尴尬又有点害羞的杜邦简直判若两人。他到底对邦德有什么请求呢？接下来，他随时都可能切入主题。

邦德回答说：“我对蟹不过敏。”

“好！好！”

杜邦停顿了一下，将手里的打火机点燃又熄灭，这样反复了几次。然后他突然意识到打火机的声音很讨厌，于是把它从自己面前推开了。他好像下定了决心，将双手放在自己身前的桌子上，开口说道：“您玩儿过卡纳斯达(1)吗，邦德先生？”

“玩儿过，不错的玩法，我喜欢。”

“玩儿过双手的吗？”

“玩儿过，但是不是很喜欢。如果你两手的牌都没犯什么低级错误的话，很容易就平局了。玩牌输赢的平均律，怎么玩儿也改变不了。”

杜邦点点头，表示同意：“确实是，我也常对自己这么说，就算玩一百局。两个水平相当的牌手输赢也差不多相当。不像金氏或俄克拉荷马这两种玩法这么让人过瘾。但是，我却恰好喜欢这种玩法。它可以让你消磨时光，可以让你支配大量的牌，你在这个过程中输输赢赢，但不管怎样，都不会有人输到心疼，不是吗？”

邦德点了点头。这时，马蒂尼端上了桌。杜邦对斟酒服务员说：“10分钟后再上两杯。”两人喝了一口酒后，杜邦转身面对邦德，这时他脸上的表情显然因为愤怒而有点扭曲了。他说：“邦德先生，如果我告诉您我玩双手卡纳斯塔在一周内竟然输了2.5万美元，您会怎么想？”邦德正要回答。杜邦却抬起手打断了他，继续说：“我应该事先告诉您这一点，我玩儿桥牌是个高手。我是摄政俱乐部的会员，跟很多类似查理·戈尔、约翰尼·克洛福德这样的高手都切磋过。我想说的是，我非常了解桥牌这种游戏。”杜邦谨慎地观察着邦德的眼神说。

“如果您一直都在跟同一个人玩儿的话，那么那个人肯定是出千了。”

“没——错！”杜邦猛地一掌拍在桌子上。他后背靠在椅背上，说：“没错！连续输了四天之后，我就告诉自己，肯定就是这么回事。于是我下定决心，既然这个混蛋出千骗我，我要向天起誓一定查出他作弊的手法，让他滚出迈阿密。于是我把赌注加倍再加倍。他当然乐得不行。我仔细观察着他出的每张牌，他的每一个动作，可是却什么都没发现，连一点蛛丝马迹都没有。牌一点儿记号都没做，都是刚拆开包装的新牌，而且是我自己的牌。他也从来没偷看过我的牌，因为我就坐在他正对面，他不可能看到。也没有人给他发什么信号。但他就是一直在赢。今天早晨赢了，今天下午又赢了。最后，我简直快被气疯了，但是我并没有表现出来。”邦德先前也许认为杜邦会爆发，所以杜邦特意提醒他，“我很礼貌地跟他结了账。然后在没有告知他的情况下，我收拾好行李，去了机场，买了飞往纽约最早的一班飞机的机票。您明白了吧？”杜邦举起了双手，“我打算逃跑了。但是输了2.5万美元就是2.5万美元，我可以继续让这个数字变成5万美元，甚至10万美元。但是我再也受不了这该死的游戏了，再也受不了没有办法揭穿这个混蛋的想法了。所以我准备逃走了。您对此怎么看？我，尤尼乌斯·杜邦，因为再也无法忍受这样的折磨而举旗投降了！”

邦德轻声咕哝了一下表示同情。这时，第二轮酒上来了。这个话题激起了邦德的兴趣，只要与打牌有关的事，他总是会感兴趣。当时的场景好像真实地浮现在他眼前：两个人玩儿了一局又一局，其中一个总是安静地洗牌，出牌，面前的筹码越堆越高，而另一个则是努力压抑住心中的怒火将手中的牌一张张掷向桌子中央。显然对方是出千了，但是怎么操作的呢？邦德开口问：“2.5万可不是小数，您玩儿多大的？”

杜邦露出了微微有点不好意思的神情：“最开始是每个点25美分，后来涨到50美分，最后是1美元。我觉得打得比较大了，因为平均每局游戏得有2000个点左右，就算是打25美分一个点的，一局下来也有500美元左右的输赢。要是1美元一个点的话，如果一直输，那简直要人命啊！”

“你中间肯定也偶尔赢过几次吧？”

“没错，但是他在牌里动的手脚太多了，所以我才打算要了这狗娘养的的命。没错，我是小赢了几把，但那也是因为他觉得应该做适当的调剂来进行掩饰，而且我那几把牌也真的给力。但是，您也知道卡纳斯塔的玩儿法，出牌是很讲究技巧的。您得布好圈套等对方上钩，然而，妈的，他就好像有读心术一样！每次我一布圈套他都能巧妙地躲开，而他一布圈套，我就肯定上当。至于发牌时做手脚，我觉得更不可能，因为每次他发牌时他拿到的都是最差的牌，但是天知道，他用这样的牌是怎么赢的。”

“房间里有镜子吗？”

“没有！我们都是在室外玩儿的。他说想晒晒太阳。确实是，他肤色晒得像龙虾似的那么红。他只在白天打牌，说晚上打的话会睡不着觉。”

“那这个人叫什么名字？”

“金手指。”

“姓什么？”

“奥瑞克。这个词意思就是金子，不是吗？他的头发是火红色的。”

“国籍呢？”

“这有点让人难以置信，但他是英国国籍，在巴哈马首都拿骚定居。从名字看人们会认为他是犹太人，但是看相貌特征应该不是。我们佛罗里达州对此有所限制，犹太人是进不来的。他持有拿骚的护照，今年42岁，未婚，职业是经纪人。这些都是护照上的信息。我刚开始跟他打牌的时候，请了一位私家侦探偷看过他的护照。”

“哪方面的经纪人？”

杜邦脸上露出了略带厌恶的笑容，说：“我问过他，他说是‘有什么就代理什么’。哼！闪烁其词的家伙。你要问他一个问题他从来都不会直接告诉你答案，总是躲躲闪闪，谈些不着边际的。”

“他有多少资产？”

“哈！”杜邦大笑了一声，“这是整件事中最让人想不通的地方。他很富有，超级富有。我让我的银行与拿骚进行过联系，确认过，拿骚的富豪多的是，而他在他们中也是数一数二的。他的钱都是以金条的形式存的。他将金条在全世界贩卖，利用金价的变化赚取利润。有点像联邦银行干的勾当。不要相信货币。我也不能说他这么做有什么不妥，从他的巨额财富看，他也肯定是有一套。但是，关键问题是，如果他那么有钱，他想方设法从我这儿赢走这2.5万美元到底是为什么？”

这时，一群服务员围到了他们的餐桌四周，这喧闹的声音倒是让邦德省去了回答这个问题的麻烦。服务员们很有礼貌地将一个装有大只雪蟹的银盘放在餐桌中央，蟹壳和蟹钳都已经敲碎了，并且在两位客人的餐盘旁边各放了一只装满牛油溶液的银质船型调料壶和一长条吐司。大杯的香槟酒冒起了粉红色的气泡。最后，在满脸堆笑地奉承了几句之后，领班依次来到他们身后，为他们系上了长及大腿的白色丝质餐巾。

这场景让邦德想起了查理斯·劳顿演的《亨利八世》。但是杜邦和邻桌的食客们对此都好像没什么大惊小怪的。杜邦脸上的笑容好像在说着“人各为己吧”，将几大块雪蟹捡到自己盘中，将它们完全浸入液态的黄油中。邦德如法炮制，开始狼吞虎咽，这可以说是他一生中享受的最美味的大餐了。

雪蟹肉是他品尝过的最为柔嫩甜美的甲壳类动物的肉了。配上干土司和略带焦糊味道的牛油溶液简直无与伦比。香槟带有淡淡的草莓味道，冰凉冰凉的。每一口香槟都让味蕾做好了迎接下一口雪蟹的准备。他们缓慢而专注地品味着美味，直到吃完几乎都没有再说话。

杜邦轻轻地打了一个嗝，用他的丝质餐巾最后一次擦了擦嘴边的牛油，身子靠在椅背上。他脸庞涨红，自豪地看着邦德，恭敬地说：“邦德先生，我觉得这世界上简直没有任何饮食能够与今天的晚餐媲美。您认为呢？”

邦德心想，我想要的就是这样舒适富足的生活。我觉得怎么样？我能喜欢自己像猪一样的吃相和人们对此的评论吗？想到以后可能还要跟杜邦像这样大吃大喝，邦德顿时有些反感。但他立刻就为这种反感的情绪感到有点羞愧。他提出了请求，也得到了满足。是他心中的道义感使他没法心安理得地接受。他许下了愿望，愿望也实现了，他应该表示感激。邦德说：“我也说不准，但是今天吃得确实不错。”

杜邦露出了满意的神情。他叫了咖啡。邦德谢绝了杜邦递过来的雪茄和餐后甜酒，点上一支香烟，饶有兴致地等着杜邦提出请求。他知道他肯定会提的。显然今晚的一切都是这个请求的铺垫。那么，就让他来吧！

杜邦清了清嗓子，说：“那么，现在，邦德先生，我有件事得请求您了。”

他盯着邦德的脸，希望能提前捕捉到任何关于他的反应的蛛丝马迹。

“什么事？”

“今天能够在机场遇见您真是幸运之至。”杜邦用低沉而真诚的嗓音说，“我从来都没忘记我们在皇家水域的第一次见面。我一直在回忆着那晚的每一个细节，回味着您打牌时候的大胆，冷静。”邦德低下头，目光凝视着桌布。但是此时，杜邦也似乎厌倦了自己对邦德的奉承，他直截了当地说：“邦德先生，我想请您帮我调查一下金手指到底是用什么方法让我输得这么惨，事成之后我会付给您一万美元的酬金。”

邦德直视着杜邦的眼睛，说：“您出的价格不错，杜邦先生。但是我必须按时返回伦敦，所以48小时内我必须赶到纽约转乘飞机。如果您明天上午和下午照常跟他打牌的话，我想应该会有足够的时间揭开这个谜团。但是不管有没有完成任务，我明晚就必须离开。您看可以吗？”

“没问题！”杜邦说。

第三章　患有旷野恐惧症的男人


窗帘噗噗拍打的声音将邦德从梦中惊醒。他掀开身上的毯子，踩着厚厚的绒头地毯走到那扇占了满满一面墙壁的落地窗前。他打开窗帘，走到洒满阳光的阳台上。

虽然还不到8点，阳台上铺着的黑白色方格图形地砖踩上去已经是暖暖的，甚至有点烫脚了。近海岸的微风轻快地从海面上吹来，将私人游艇停泊港码头沿岸挂着的各国国旗吹得随风鼓动。海风很潮湿，并且夹杂着强烈的海洋气息。邦德猜测，这样的海风肯定会被游客所爱，却被当地居民厌恶。这样的海风很容易导致家中的五金配件生锈，使书本受潮，使墙纸和图画腐烂，并让衣服上生出霉斑。

在12层楼以下是一个花园，里面种植着成片的变叶木，几株棕榈树点缀其中。干净整洁的碎石铺成的小路两旁种植的九重葛长得茂密而苍翠。几名园丁正在打扫，动作显得缓慢而懒散。两名割草工正在草坪上修剪，他们修剪完毕之处，自动洒水器正不紧不慢地喷洒出细细的水雾。

在邦德的正下方，帕格瓦拉会所像一条优雅的曲线蜿蜒着向海滩延伸。会所两层楼高的屋顶上散布着一些桌椅，并且偶尔可见一两把红白条纹相间的遮阳伞。会所的建筑群中间可以看到一个跟奥运会泳池规模相当的碧绿色矩形泳池，泳池四周遍布着一排排折叠的帆布椅子，只要每天50美元的价钱，游客便可以在此享受整日的日光浴。一些穿白色外套的工人正穿梭于这些椅子之间，摆正椅子，整理坐垫，清扫游客们昨日丢弃的烟头。再往远处看去就是长长的金色海岸了，更多的工人正在那里做着清理工作，他们耙平海浪在海滩上留下的痕迹，撑开遮阳伞，铺设好坐垫。邦德房间的衣橱里有一张卡片，上面标明阿罗哈套房的价格——每天200美元。邦德粗略地计算了一下，如果他自己付账的话，在这里住上三个星期就足以把他整年的工资花光了。想到这，邦德开心地笑了。他回到房间，拿起电话，点了一份美味而奢侈的早餐，一盒切斯特菲尔德香烟和一份报纸。

他刮完脸，洗了个冷水澡，又穿好衣服，时间刚好是8点整。他走进客厅，发现一个身穿紫红色带有金色装饰制服的服务员正在窗边将早餐摆上桌。邦德扫了一眼送来的《迈阿密先驱报》，头版上刊登的是美国在位于不远处的卡纳维拉尔角发射洲际弹道导弹失败，以及在海厄利亚一场大型比赛中发生大骚乱的消息。

邦德随手将报纸扔在地上，坐下来一边慢慢享受他的早餐，一边思考关于杜邦和金手指先生的事。

他也不能确定到底是哪种情况，要么杜邦打牌的真实水平比他想象的要差很多，虽然从他强硬而精明的性格看来这不太可能，要么就是金手指出千了。如果这位金手指先生不缺钱，又在打牌的时候做手脚的话，那么肯定他是通过其他更大规模的诈骗发财的。邦德对大骗局一向感兴趣，于是他开始对于金手指的初次会面有点期待了。他也同样期待能够当面揭穿金手指无比神秘又成功至极的诈骗杜邦钱财的手段。今天肯定会是相当有趣的一天。邦德无所事事地等待着这一切的到来。

根据事先的安排，邦德将于10点在花园里与杜邦会面。他们会谎称邦德从纽约乘坐飞机来这里，向杜邦推销几支先前被英国人持有的加拿大天然气的股票。这件事相当机密，因此金手指也就不会想到就细节问题盘问邦德了。股票、天然气、加拿大，邦德需要记住的仅此而已。他们将一同来到帕格瓦拉会所的屋顶上，杜邦和金手指将在这里继续他们的桥牌游戏，而邦德将在看报纸的掩饰下仔细观察。在早午餐期间，他们将稍事休息，邦德会与杜邦谈谈他们“生意”上的事，然后，他们继续打牌。杜邦询问过还有没有什么其他需要他安排的。邦德问能不能提供金手指的房间号和钥匙。他解释说如果金手指是一名职业出千者或者业余出千高手的话，那么他旅行途中肯定要携带一些专业的工具——做过记号的牌、递牌工具之类的。杜邦答应他们在花园会面时会把钥匙交给邦德，他从经理那里拿到一把钥匙应该是不成问题。

早餐之后，邦德放松地望着海中央。即将到来的任务并没有让他觉得紧张，反而有点兴奋。实际上，他正需要一份这样的任务帮他驱散墨西哥事件的阴霾。

9：30之后，邦德离开了他的套房，在他下榻的那层的走廊里徘徊了一会儿，特意熟悉了一下酒店房间的布局。在此过程中，他两次遇到了同一名女服务员，向她问了问路，然后穿过菠萝购物中心里嘈杂的人群走向了电梯。他了解到酒店中设有竹子咖啡店、约会酒吧、热带餐厅、可供儿童娱乐的基特俱乐部以及隆隆夜总会。之后，他走向了花园。花园里，一身A&F沙滩休闲装打扮的杜邦将金手指入住的套房钥匙交到了邦德手中。他们迈着悠闲的步子走到帕格瓦拉会所，爬了两层楼梯到达了屋顶。

金手指给邦德留下的第一印象十分让人惊奇。在远远的屋顶一角，酒店所在的峭壁的旁边，一个男人躺在折叠帆布躺椅上，双腿翘起，身上只穿了一件黄色绸缎的三角裤，戴着太阳镜，下巴下戴着一对宽宽的锡制的东西，形状像一对翅膀。这对“翅膀”像是在他的脖子四周围了一圈，向肩膀以外延伸着，在顶端处微微有点向上翘起。

邦德说：“他脖子上戴的是什么东西？”

“您没见过这个吗？”杜邦吃惊地说，“那是个能帮助人晒黑的小装置。可以做到全方位晒黑。它能将阳光反射到下巴下面和耳朵后面这些通常晒不到的地方。”

“哦，原来是这样！”邦德说。

他们走到离这个人几英尺远的时候，杜邦爽朗地打起了招呼：“嗨，你好啊！”那嗓门在邦德看来有点大得过分了。

然而金手指一动没动。

杜邦用他正常的音量解释说：“他耳朵有点聋。”这时，他们已走到金手指的面前，杜邦又大声地向他打招呼。

金手指猛地坐了起来，摘掉太阳镜说：“嗨！你好！”他将那对“翅膀”从自己脖子上摘下来，小心翼翼地放到他脚边的地上，站起身来，用询问的目光看着邦德。

“给您介绍一下，这是邦德先生，詹姆斯·邦德。与您一样都是英国人，现在在纽约工作，今天过来跟我谈点生意上的事。”

金手指先生向邦德伸出右手，说：“邦博先生，很高兴认识您。”

邦德握了握这只手，感觉到它又干又硬。两只手轻轻地握了握就各自抽回了。就在此时，金手指先生那双蓝色略带苍白的眼睛睁得大大的，紧紧地盯着邦德，他的目光似乎穿过邦德的皮肤透入了骨髓。之后，他的嘴角垂了下来，目光也黯淡了下来，他捡起地上的曝光胶片一边收好一边说：“今天不打了。”他的语气显得平淡而呆板，听起来就是一个陈述句而不是什么疑问句。

“您什么意思？不打了？”杜邦大声地吵嚷着，“您不会以为我就这么心甘情愿认输了吧？实话告诉您，不赢回来我就不离开这该死的酒店。”杜邦一边说一边咯咯笑着，“我让山姆把桌子准备好。詹姆斯说他对桥牌不怎么在行，也想学一学。对吧，詹姆斯？”他转身对邦德说，“您在这儿晒晒太阳看看报纸，没问题吧？”

“我很乐意在这儿休息一会儿，”邦德说，“您知道，旅行也挺让人疲惫的。”

金手指又看了一眼邦德，然后目光躲避开了。“那好，我去穿衣服。本来我今天下午要跟伯克莱顿的阿莫先生学打高尔夫球的。但是对我来说什么爱好也不如桥牌来得重要。打高尔夫看来得排到后面了。”他毫无表情的目光又落在邦德身上，问：“您打高尔夫吗，邦博先生？”

邦德大声说：“在英格兰的时候偶尔会打打。”

“哦，那您通常在哪儿打？”

“汉特库伯(1)。”

“哦，那是个不错的球场。我最近刚刚加入了皇家圣马克斯俱乐部。桑威奇球场离我工作的地方很近，您听说过那儿吗？”

“我在那儿打过球。”

“您的差点(2)是多少？”

“9杆。”

“真巧，我的也是9杆。咱们改天得一起打一场。”金手指先生弯腰捡起他的锡制“翅膀”，对杜邦说，“我五分钟后回来。”然后转身慢慢地向楼梯走去。

邦德觉得很有意思。这个大亨并不真的在意邦德的生意，既然邦德站在自己面前，他就暂且认为邦德跟他大概是同属一个阶层的人，与这样一位人物的接触使邦德暂时忘记了这个社会对自己的嗤之以鼻。

杜邦对一名身穿白色上衣的服务员吩咐了一番，马上就有其他两名服务员过来铺设牌桌。邦德走到围绕屋顶的围栏边，望着下面的花园，琢磨起金手指先生。

他给邦德留下的印象还算深刻。金手指先生是邦德见过的最为悠闲的人之一。这一点从他的动作、语言、表情等各方面间接都能看得出来。金手指先生说话做事都显得轻而易举，但看得出来，在他的淡定之中还夹杂着某种纷乱、压抑的东西。

当金手指站起来时，给邦德留下深刻印象的一点就是这个人身上的一切都有点不成比例。金手指个子比较矮，超不过五英尺高，在短小粗壮的大腿和身体上面长着浑圆的肩膀，肩膀上的一颗头又大又圆。他的整个身体就好像是由来自别人不同的身体部位拼凑起来的，看起来很不协调。邦德想，也许金手指是由于想掩饰自己的丑陋才如此痴迷于晒成古铜色的皮肤吧，否则他的身体将会显得更加怪诞不羁。他那红色平头下的面容虽说不算丑陋，但也有点奇怪，脸型像满月，但却没有月亮的神采。额头又高又滑，两道细细的沙色眉毛下面闪烁着一双大大的淡蓝色的眼睛，睫毛颜色很浅。面部轮廓相当男子气，高高的颧骨中间有一个肉肉的鹰钩鼻子。嘴唇薄薄的，线条笔直，嘴型精致，下巴紧致而结实。“总之，”邦德想，“这像是一张思考者的脸，就像一位科学家，脸上透着冷漠、世俗、坚忍和顽强，一种奇怪的性格组合。”

他还猜测到了什么呢？邦德往往会对矮个子男人不怎么信任。因为他们往往是在自卑情绪中成长的。他们一生中都热衷于追求比别人更强更大，梦想击败那些在童年时期取笑过他们的人，拿破仑和希特勒都是这样的矮子。正是这些矮子给全世界都带来了大麻烦。那么如果是一个红头发的，面容怪异，身材畸形的男人呢？这种几率岂不是更要大大增加了吗？他成长过程中肯定遭受了不少这样的压力。这样一个男人内心活力充沛，如果有人在他嘴里塞上一个灯泡，没准都能亮起来。邦德想到这里脸上露出了一丝微笑。金手指是通过何种途径来将他内心的这种能力进行释放的呢？通过致富？性？获得权力？也许都有吧。他从前是什么身份呢？今天他是英国人，但是从前呢？不会是犹太人——虽然他可能会有部分犹太血统。不会是拉丁人，更不会来自更远的南方。不会是斯拉夫人，或许是德国人吧？不，肯定是巴伊特人！一定是来自那里！那个波罗的海最古老的省份之一。很有可能是为躲避俄国人才离开家乡的。金手指一定是事先得到了什么警示，或者是他父母嗅到了什么危险的气息，让他及时逃脱了。之后呢？他是通过什么方式成了世界上最富有的人之一的呢？也许有一天挖掘这些会是一件有意思的事，但是今天，邦德只要将他打牌时候的手段探查明白就够了。

“准备好了吗？”杜邦向从屋顶那头走向牌桌的金手指打着招呼。金手指这时已经穿戴整齐了——一套深蓝色西装合体舒适，白衬衫的领口稍稍敞开着——这么一打扮，他的模样看着还算过得去了。

但是，任凭他怎么打扮，也无法遮盖他那足球般棕红色的脑袋，左耳中插着的肉色助听器更加剧了这种滑稽的效果。

杜邦背对酒店坐了下来。金手指坐在他的对面，开始切牌。杜邦赢了，把另一副牌推给了金手指，并用手指敲了敲，表示牌已经洗过了，而他也不想费力切牌了，于是，金手指开始发牌。

邦德慢悠悠地踱过来，拿了一把椅子坐在杜邦身边，靠着椅背，一副悠闲的样子。他假装把报纸翻到了体育版，实则在细心地观察着牌局上的蛛丝马迹。

虽然邦德事先认为金手指肯定是牌局里出千的惯犯，但从表面上却是一点痕迹都没有发现。金手指出牌又快又高效，他并没有使用机械工式握牌法——中指、无名指和小指弯曲握住牌的一个长边，食指握住牌外侧的一个短边，这种握牌方式方便发牌者出千。而且，他也并没有佩戴任何能够刺穿纸牌的图章戒指，手指上也没缠有能在牌上做记号的医用胶布之类的。

杜邦转身对邦德说：“打的是15张，抓两张打出一张，否则就按摄政时期的规则。红色三点牌和欧洲的玩法都是胡闹，我们不玩儿。”

杜邦拿起他的牌。邦德注意到他拿牌非常专业，并不是按照大小从左到右排列的，也没有将一对百搭牌放在最左边——这种习惯拿法会对一个善于观察的对手相当有利。杜邦把手中的好牌都放在中间的位置，而两边都是单牌杂牌。

游戏开始了。杜邦先抓牌，竟神奇地抓上来了一对百搭牌，然而他脸上什么表情都没有表现出来。他漫不经心地打出了一张。只要再抓上两把好牌，他就赢了，但是这也得需要运气才行。因为每次抓两张牌可以增加拿到好牌的概率，但是同样也有可能让你手里的牌越来越差。

金手指打得更加深思熟虑，速度慢得甚至有点让人抓狂。抓完牌后，他要将牌抽出来放回去，反复几次才打出一张。

到第三次抓牌时，杜邦手中的牌已经相当不错了，他只需要一张5就可以击败对手了。金手指似乎已经了解到自己的危险处境，打出了三张百搭牌和四个5，做了一个卡纳斯塔，并且甩掉了一些杂牌，现在，他手里只剩四张牌了。他本该输掉100多分，但这下反而赢了400分。他迅速甩牌使杜邦赢牌的机会化为了泡影。

“天哪！差点就干掉你了！”杜邦的声音里带有一丝愤怒，“你怎么知道该跑了？”

金手指漠然地说：“闻到麻烦的气息了。”他把他的点数加了加，报出了一个数，并且记得下来，等着杜邦计分。然后，他切了牌，靠在椅背上礼貌地致意。

“您要在这待上一阵吗，邦博先生？”

邦德微笑着说：“我的名字是邦德，B-O-N-D。我在这儿待不了多长时间，今晚就得回纽约了。”

“那真是太遗憾了。”金手指噘了噘嘴，礼貌地表达了一下遗憾，然后又转身继续打牌了。邦德拿起报纸，盯着体育版上棒球赛的比分，然而却全神贯注地听着他们打牌的声音。金手指赢了一把又一把，打完一局之后，两个人差出了1500点，也就是说，金手指赢了1500美元。

“又来了！”杜邦声音里带有那么一点哀怨。

邦德放下报纸，说：“他经常赢吗？”

“经常赢？”这个词几乎是从杜邦鼻子里带着厌恶哼出来的，“他几乎都没输过！”

谈话间，他们又切好了牌，金手指开始发牌了。

邦德说：“你们不换换位置吗？我觉得打牌的时候换换位置能转运。”

金手指停下了手里发牌的动作。他表情凝重地看了邦德一眼，说：“很抱歉，邦德先生，如果换了位置我就打不了了。我从最开始就跟杜邦解释过了，我得了一种奇怪的病——旷野恐惧症——顾名思义，我看到开阔地就会害怕，面对开阔地我肯定打不了牌。所以我必须得坐这个面对酒店的位置。”

“噢，那真是遗憾。”邦德嗓音沉重，但同时对这个话题表现出了极大的兴趣，“这个病还真少见。我听说过幽闭恐惧症，您这个病听起来好像正好相反，我还真第一次听说。怎么会这样呢？”

金手指一边拿起他的那把牌开始整理一边说：“我也不知道。”他的声音听起来很平静，不带有一丝感情。

邦德站起来，说：“我得站起来伸伸腰了，我去那边望望游泳池。”

“好的，没问题，”杜邦愉快地说，“您请便，詹姆斯。咱们吃完午饭还有的是时间谈生意呢。看这把，看我能不能赢了我的朋友金手指。咱们待会见。”

金手指目光集中在他手里的牌上，没有抬头。邦德慢慢地踱着步，从零散的几个正在享受日光浴的游客身边经过，来到屋顶另一端能够俯瞰游泳池的栏杆旁边。他站在那儿，盯着下面那些一排排躺在帆布折叠椅上的肤色或粉红或棕黄或白色的游客看了一会儿。浓重的防晒油味儿扑面而来。几个孩子和年轻人在泳池里游泳。高台跳水板上站着一个男人，看样子是个专业的跳水运动员，也可能是个游泳教练。他头发金黄，身上肌肉发达，像希腊神话里的神一样。他先是双脚掌着地站着，然后突然轻盈地跃起，跳了下去，双臂打开，像是一对翅膀。然后，这对“翅膀”合成一个箭头的形状劈开水面，身体紧随其后钻入了水中，水面上水波荡漾。他从水中折返浮出水面，很稚气地甩了甩头。周围响起了零星的掌声。他费力地向泳池边游过去，头埋没在水面以下，肩膀用力带动着胳膊划水。邦德想，祝你好运吧！你从事这项运动的时间超不过五六年了。高台跳水这项运动不可能从事太长时间，因为每跳一次头骨都得承受巨大的冲击力，这一点跟跳台滑雪一样。因此这些运动可以算是运动生命最短的项目了。邦德向着这个跳水运动员喃喃自语：“趁早赚点钱吧！还不如趁年轻闯闯娱乐圈呢！”

邦德转身望了望酒店墙壁下玩卡纳斯塔的那两个人，不禁想道，究竟是金手指真的喜欢面对酒店的位置，还是他希望让杜邦坐在背对酒店的位置呢？到底是为什么呢？对了，他的房间号是多少来着？200号，夏威夷套房。邦德的房间是在顶层，房间号是1200。按照房间排列的规律来计算，金手指的房间应该就在邦德的房间的正下方，在三楼，恰好是帕格瓦拉会所屋顶上方大约20码的地方——也就是说，距离牌桌只有20码的距离。邦德在心里认真地计算着，确定下金手指房间的位置。然而看了看，却什么都没发现，只有一个空空的阳台，阳台门敞开着通向套房内部，里面黑乎乎的，什么都看不清了。邦德在心里默默计算着距离和角度。没错，他可能是这么做到的！肯定是这么回事！狡猾的金手指先生。

第四章　败露


杜邦与金手指下午再战的时间是3点，午餐之后有一段休息时间。

上午的牌局中，杜邦又输了1万多美元，他确信金手指肯定有个帮手。

“从来没见过，她总是待在套房里。也许就是他带来一起玩儿的歌舞团女演员。”他的笑容里饱含深意，“我没别的意思，就是一起放松放松嘛！怎么？你是不是想到什么了？”

邦德没有肯定地回答。“我还不敢断言。下午我可能不来观战了。您就说我看得厌倦了，到城里逛逛去。”他顿了顿，“如果我的推断没错的话，您就等着看好戏吧。如果金手指开始有奇怪的行为，那您就安安静静地坐着看就行了。虽然我还不能向您承诺什么，但我想我已经了解他的把戏了。我的推断也有可能是错的，我也说不准。”

听到这话，杜邦立马热情洋溢：“不错呀，伙计！我已经等不及揭穿这混蛋的把戏了。瞎了他的狗眼！”

邦德乘电梯回到了自己的套房。他打开行李箱，拿出了一架M3莱卡照相机，一张MC曝光表，一个K2滤光器和一个闪光灯。他给闪光灯安上了一个灯泡，检查了一下相机，然后到阳台上看了一眼太阳的位置，估算了一下午3：30左右太阳大概的方位。然后回到客厅，让通往阳台的门保持敞开的状态。他站在门口，将曝光表设置好。曝光率是每秒1/100。他将曝光表安装在莱卡相机上，将遮光器设置在F11上，并将距离设置为12英尺。他打开镜头盖，拍了一张照片，确认设置都没有问题。他将胶卷封好，卸下闪光灯，将相机放到一边。然后，他又回到行李箱边，拿出了一本厚厚的文学版《圣经》并且打开，从他的伯恩斯马丁手枪套里抽出了一把华尔瑟PPK袖珍手枪。他将手枪套塞进左边的裤子口袋里，还尝试着快速地向外拔出了一两次，自己感觉还比较满意。他认为金手指入住的夏威夷布局应该跟自己的套房一模一样，于是仔细观察了一下自己套房的地形。他想象着自己走进楼下套房的房门时会是怎样的一番情景。他在不同的几个门锁上实验了怎样不带任何声响地用他的万能钥匙开锁。之后，他拿了一把椅子坐在敞开着的阳台门前，点燃一根香烟，坐下来看着远方的海面，考虑着当时机到来的时候怎么向金手指将事情挑明。

时间到了下午3：15，邦德赶紧起身，来到阳台上，小心地查看了一下会所屋顶上的那两个打牌的身影。接着，他返回到房间内，检查了一下莱卡相机上的曝光表。光线跟刚才一样。他穿上了蓝黑色薄款精纺毛料西装，整理了一下领带，将莱卡相机的带子挂在脖子上，相机自然垂在他的胸前。最后，他环顾了一下四周，走出房间，径直朝电梯走去。他乘电梯来到一楼，停在酒店前厅的橱窗前观察了一下。当电梯重新向楼上运行后，他走到楼梯间，慢慢地向上爬了两层。没错，三楼的地形跟十三楼一模一样。200房间所在的位置跟他之前预想的也一致。楼道里一个人也没有。他拿出万能钥匙，悄悄打开了房门，进去之后又将门轻轻关上。在狭窄的门厅里，挂着一件雨衣，一件薄款驼毛外套和一顶小礼帽。邦德将莱卡相机紧紧握在手中，举到自己面前。他轻轻推了一下客厅的门：门没有锁。邦德很轻松地将门推开了。

未见其人，先闻其声，是一个女声，低沉而有魅力，英国口音：“抓上来一张4一张5。再有两张2就做成5的卡纳斯塔了。打出一张4。手里的单牌有K、J、9和7。”

邦德轻轻溜进了房间。

映入眼帘的是一个女郎，坐在房间里距离阳台门一码左右的一张桌子上，桌子上还垫了两个垫子，这两个垫子是为了增加她的高度的。现在是一天中气温最高的时候，所以她身上只穿着一件黑色文胸和一件黑色丝质内裤。她无聊地晃动着双腿，将刚刚染好指甲的左手伸到自己面前欣赏了一下，又将手放到唇边把指甲吹了吹；同时，伸出右手将刷指甲油的小刷子放回到身边桌上露华浓指甲油的小瓶子里。在她眼前几英尺的地方正是一架高倍双筒望远镜的目镜，这架望远镜由一个三脚架支撑，三脚架其中的一条腿正好在她下垂着的晒成古铜色的双腿之间。望远镜下方有一个麦克风，上面的电线连接着桌子下方的一个盒子，大概是一个便携式录音机的大小。盒子里又引出了几根线，连接在墙边餐柜上面的一个闪着亮光的室内天线上。

她又身子前倾双眼看向望远镜，身上的内裤随之绷紧。“抓上来一张Q和一张K。对Q，再来一张王就能凑上对K了。出7。”说完，她关上了麦克风。

正当她刚才集中注意力报牌的时候，邦德快速地穿过房间，几乎来到了她的身后，那儿有一张椅子。他一边在心里默默祈祷着椅子千万不要发出声音，一边站了上去。现在他的高度足够看到整个全景了。他把眼睛放到取景器前。没错，全看见了，女郎的头，望远镜，麦克风，以及20码以外的楼下，正在打牌的两个身影，杜邦手中的牌也完完全全、清清楚楚地呈现在他的眼前。邦德分得清黑白，他赶紧按下了快门。

闪光灯尖锐的声音和刺目的亮光吓得女郎惊声尖叫，她飞快地转过身。

邦德从椅子上从容地下来，说：“下午好。”

“你是谁？你想干什么？”女郎的一只手捂着嘴，惊恐地看着邦德。

“我已经得到我想要的了。别担心，都结束了。我叫邦德，詹姆斯·邦德。”

邦德小心翼翼地将他的相机放在椅子上，走过来站在能够闻到女郎身上的香味的半径范围内。这个女郎很漂亮，她头发是浅浅的金色，顺滑地披在她的肩膀上，并且相当的长。她深蓝色的眼睛镶嵌在晒成古铜色的脸庞上，嘴唇线条清晰而柔和，笑起来一定很好看。

她站起来，将手从嘴边移开。她个子很高，估计得有五英尺十英寸。胳膊腿看起来都坚实有力，像个游泳运动员。她的胸脯在黑色的文胸下高耸着。

她目光里透出了害怕的神色。她用低沉的声音问：“你想怎样？”

“对你不会怎样，但我想逗逗金手指。乖乖站过来，让我来看一眼。”

邦德站在女郎先前的位置，透过望远镜看过去。游戏还在继续进行。关于他和这个女郎的通讯中断这件事，金手指并没有任何表现。

“收不到信号他没事吗？他还会继续玩儿吗？”

她有点犹豫地说：“有时候某个插头松了也会有类似的情况，他会耐心等我修复的。”

邦德向她笑了笑。“嗯，咱们让他着着急，抽支烟放松一下吧。”他递过一包彻斯特菲尔德香烟，她拿了一支。邦德接着说：“你可以趁这会儿工夫把右手的指甲也涂好。”

她嘴角浮现了一丝微笑，说：“你什么时候来的？你可着实吓了我一跳。”

“时间不长。关于吓你一跳这件事我也很抱歉。你知道，这一个星期以来，杜邦也被金手指吓得不轻啊。”

“也是，”她的语气显得有点犹豫不决，“我想我们这么做确实有点过分，但是他确实挺有钱，不是吗？”

“是，我不需要为杜邦担忧，但是不知道哪天金手指也有可能会选中某个穷光蛋当牺牲品。不管怎么说，他自己已经是个百万富翁了，他为什么还要这么做呢？他有的是钱啊。”

她脸上又浮现了兴奋的表情。“我知道，我也不理解他这一点。他内心对赚钱十分的狂热，他就是放不下。我问过他为什么，他说如果赚钱的机会来了你还不去赚那你就是个傻子。他劝我帮他做这个的时候，”她挥了挥拿烟的手指了指望远镜，“我问他为什么要冒这愚蠢的风险，他说：‘这就是第二招，没有机会，就创造机会。’”

邦德说：“嗯，我既不是私人侦探，也不是迈阿密警察，他还算幸运。”

女郎耸了耸肩，说：“对他来说那都不是事儿。他只要收买你就行了。没有谁是他收买不了的，谁也拒绝不了金子。”

“你什么意思？”

她漠不关心地说：“如果需要过海关，他腰上总是缠着一个装满金币的袋子。要在平时，他都总是随身携带价值大约一百万美元的金子，就装在行李箱里。那可以说得上是个皮面的真金行李箱。”

“那箱子估计得有一吨重吧！”

“他出行总是坐他的专车，车上装有减震设施。司机是个大块头，负责搬运箱子。别人都没有机会碰那个箱子。”

“他为什么要一直随身携带这么多金子呢？”

“以备不时之需呗！他知道他想要的没有什么是金子买不到的。都是24K的黄金。而且，他也喜欢金子，就像有些人是真心喜欢珠宝啊、邮票啊，还有——”女郎笑了笑，“女人啊。”

邦德也笑了笑，问：“那他是真心喜欢你吗？”

女郎脸突然涨得通红，有点愤怒地说：“当然不是！”然后，她的语气回归平淡，说：“当然了，你愿意怎么想都随便。但是他确实不是真心喜欢我。我是说，他喜欢让人们认为我们——我——爱情是存在的。你知道，他也不是多有魅力的人，我觉得我们之间的关系最多也就是基于——虚荣吧。”

“噢，我明白了。那你也就算是他的一个助理吧？”

“伴侣，”她更正道，“我不需要做打字之类的事。”她突然用手捂住了嘴，“哦，我不应该告诉你这些的！你不会告诉他吧？他会炒我鱿鱼的。”她眼睛里显现出了害怕的神色，“也许是别的什么惩罚，我也不知道他会怎样。他这样的人，什么事都干得出来。”

“我当然不会告诉他，但是你这么过日子也不快活啊，你为什么要干这个呢？”

她冷冷地说：“一星期100英镑，就为这点钱，仅此而已。”

她抬手指了指金手指的房间，说：“这活儿干得也不易。我正攒钱呢，攒够了就不干了。”

但是金手指会放她走吗？邦德深感怀疑。她知道的也太多了点儿吧？他看了看这张美丽的脸庞，还有这迷人的身材。她可能还没意识到，但是为了这点儿钱，对她来说要摆脱金手指恐怕已经不是那么容易的事了。

女郎突然变得有点坐立不安。她尴尬地笑笑，说：“我觉得我穿得有点不得体了，我能不能去找件衣服穿上？”

邦德不确定是否应该信任这个女郎，毕竟付给她100英镑周薪的人不是他。他半开玩笑地说：“你穿成这样挺好的啊，跟那些游泳池边的游客们穿得一样体面。而且，”他伸了伸腰，“也是时候帮金手指先生救救场了。”

谈话过程中，邦德时不时地关注着楼下的牌局。看起来好像没什么异常。邦德又弯腰从望远镜里看过去。这时，杜邦像换了一个人，他姿势豪放，粉红色的侧脸上露出了兴奋的表情。他正从手里拿出了一把牌甩了出去，是一个由K做成的卡纳斯塔。邦德将望远镜的角度向上调了一英寸，正好看到金手指那红月亮一样的脸庞，脸上的表情冷淡而漠然。金手指正在耐心地等待着时来运转。他的手放在助听器上，朝里按了按，等着信号随时恢复。

邦德向后退了一步。“机器不错，”他评价说，“你们通过什么传播信号的？”

“他告诉过我，但是我不记得了。”她转了转眼球，努力回忆着，“好像是170什么的，还有兆什么。”

“兆赫吧，有可能。听了你的话，我觉得，如果他不是拥有很多出租车或跟警察有什么关系的话，倒是挺奇怪的。那他肯定是拥有什么魔力了。”邦德笑着说，“好吧，就是现在吧，是该揭开他面具的时候了。”

听到他这么说，女郎突然伸手拽住了他的袖子。她的中指上戴着一枚金色的克拉大夫戒指，是两只手捧着一颗心的造型。女郎声音里带着哭腔，说：“您非得这么做吗？您就不能放过他吗？我不知道他会怎么处置我。求您了。”

她犹豫了一下，脸上涨得通红，好像有点生气似的。“而且，我喜欢您。我已经很久没见过像您这样的人了。您就再在这儿待一小会儿好吗？”她低下头盯着地板，“如果您能放过他，我——您让我做什么都行。”

邦德微微笑了一下。他将女郎的手放在自己手中轻轻地捏了捏：“不好意思，我也是拿人钱财，身不由己。而且——”他淡淡地说，“我也确实想做这件事。是时候修理修理金手指先生了。准备好了吗？”

他没等回答就弯腰凑近了望远镜，它依然是聚焦在金手指身上。邦德清了清嗓子，仔细地看着那张大脸。他用手试探着找到了麦克风的开关，按了下去。

金手指耳朵里的接收器肯定发出了静电的噪音。虽然他面部的表情没有什么变化，但是他缓缓地抬起头继而又低了下去，就像礼拜结束时祈求赐福的姿势一样。

邦德以轻柔但又不失严厉的声音对着麦克风说：“现在，听我说，金手指。”他停顿了一下。这时，金手指脸上依然没有什么表情变化，但是他的头稍稍低下了一点，好像在仔细倾听的样子。

他假装仔细研究手中的牌，双手一动不动。

“我是詹姆斯·邦德。还记得我吧？游戏结束了，是你付出代价的时候了。我拍了一张照片，把你布的局都拍下来了：金发美女、望远镜、麦克风、你，还有你的耳机接收器。你要服从我接下来说的每一句话，我就不会把这张照片送到美国联邦调查局和伦敦警察厅。如果听明白了你就点点头。”

金手指脸上依然是表情全无，但是那颗又大又圆的头轻轻地向前伸了一下，又很快抬了起来。

“把你手里的牌牌面朝上放在桌上。”

金手指双手下垂，然后张开，手中的牌从他的指间滑落到了桌上。

“拿出你的支票簿，开一张5万美元的支票。用途如下：3.5万是你从杜邦先生手里骗走的，1万是我的酬劳，剩下的5千是作为浪费了杜邦先生这么多时间的赔偿。”

邦德密切关注着望远镜那头的情况，看他发出的指令是不是都被遵守了。他也顺便看了杜邦一眼。杜邦此刻身子前倾，瞠目结舌。

金手指慢慢撕下支票，并在背面签了名。

“好，现在我说，你在支票簿背面记下来，别记错了。帮我订一个银陨号列车今晚去纽约的包厢。让他们在包厢里备好一瓶加冰的葡萄香槟，再多准备点鱼子酱三明治，要用最好的鱼子酱。途中不能有人打扰我，不能有任何人闹事。如果我明天不能安全到达纽约的话，那么自会有人在邮箱里发现这张照片，以及该将它送到哪儿去的说明。如果听明白了你就点点头。”

那颗大头又一次上下地点了点。这时，在他那高高的平滑的额头上出现了几道汗水流过的痕迹。

“好，现在把支票递给杜邦先生，对他说：‘我向您诚挚地道歉，我打牌的时候一直在出千。’说完你就可以走了。”

邦德看着金手指的手伸向牌桌对面，将支票放在杜邦面前。嘴巴张了张像是说了什么，眼神平和而沉着。金手指松了口气。不就是钱吗？给他钱好了。

“等等，金手指！还没完。”邦德看了那个女郎一眼。她正在用奇怪的眼神看着他，这眼神里不仅有痛苦和恐惧，还带有一丝恭谨，一丝渴望。

“你叫什么名字？”

“吉尔·玛斯特顿。”

这时，金手指已经站了起来，转身正要离开。邦德厉声说：“站住！”

金手指停下了迈出一半的步子，抬起头看着阳台。这时，他的眼睛睁得大大的，就像邦德第一次看见他时的样子。他那凌厉而镇定的目光像X射线一样穿透望远镜的透镜，直逼邦德的双眼，一直透到他的骨髓里。这目光好像在说：“你等着，邦德！我不会忘记的。”

邦德继续柔声说道：“我忘记了，还有一件事。我得带个人质，所以玛斯特顿小姐得跟我一起上火车。还有，记得订个带客厅的包厢，就这样吧。”





第五章　夜班


一个星期之后。在位于摄政公园的办公楼里，邦德站在八楼上一扇打开的窗前，那里是英国情报局的总部。天空中的一轮满月穿梭于一片人形的云彩之间，将月光洒向沉睡中的伦敦市区。大本钟敲响了三声。漆黑的房间中一部电话响了起来。邦德急忙转过身，快速走到屋子中央的书桌前，打开了带有绿色灯罩的台灯。是第四排的一部黑色电话在响。他伸出手，把电话接了起来。

“执勤处。”

“是H站，先生。”

“接过来。”

听筒里传来了“哧啦哧啦”的声音，以及与香港连接的时候发出的“砰砰”的噪音。为什么中国上空总是有太阳黑子呢？终于，一个语调平缓的声音传来：“国际出口公司吗？”

“对。”

一个深沉而亲切的声音——伦敦腔——说：“已经为您接通香港，请讲。”

邦德不耐烦地说：“请把通话质量改善一下。”

那个语调平缓的声音继续说：“已经为您接通，请讲。”

“你好！你好！国际出口公司吗？”

“对。”

“我是迪克森，听得到吗？”

“听得到。”

“上次我发给您的那船芒果——水果——您记得吗？”

“是，已经收到了。”邦德将文件夹拉到自己面前。他知道是什么事了。三个外国特工叛徒在澳门拦截了英国的一艘货船，想在上面搜查偷渡者，H站需要一些水下爆破弹来对付他们。

“必须得出10倍的价钱。”

这话的意思是这些叛徒已经离开了，或者是在此之后需要双倍的人手来防范他们，也有可能是发生了别的什么突发事件。

邦德简洁地说：“照办！”

“多谢！再见。”

“再见。”邦德放下了电话听筒。他紧接着拿起了绿色的电话听筒，拨通了Q分部的号码，与那个部门的执勤员进行了通话，没有什么问题。大不列颠海外航空公司第二天一早会有一架航班准时起飞。Q分部会确保将货箱装上飞机。

邦德坐了下来，拿出一支烟来点着，想起了他在香港那间临近水边、空间狭小、空气糟糕的办公室，眼前仿佛出现了那个身影，身穿印着数字279的满是汗渍的白色衬衫。他跟那个人很熟，那人自称迪克森。现在279很可能正在跟他的下线交代：“没问题，伦敦已经批准了。咱们开始行动吧，一切重新安排。”邦德苦笑了一下。他们比他强，他从来也没喜欢过与中国人作对的任务，他们人太多了。H站这么做很可能是捅马蜂窝的行为，但是M认为，趁着对香港的控制权还在，是时候表达一下反对意见了。

三天前，当M通知他要负责夜班的时候，他还有点不以为然。他争辩过，提出他对站里的日常工作还不够熟悉。对于他这样一个在双O部门工作了六年，对于站内的日常工作已经全然忘记的人来说，这个责任有点过于重大了。

“你很快就能熟悉起来，”M冷漠无情地说，“如果有什么麻烦还有执勤部的工作人员和参谋总长在——或者你也可以随时联系我。”（想到因为开罗或东京的某场小骚乱他就深更半夜把M叫醒的情景，邦德脸上忍不住露出了一丝笑容。）

“无论如何，我已经决定了。我希望所有的高级军官都轮班来做一些日常工作。”M冷峻地看着邦德说，“事实上，007，有一次，财政部有人来访，他们的联络员认为我们的双O部根本没有存在的必要。他们提出双O部的工作职责已经跟不上时代了。我都无力争辩。”

M的声音渐渐变得温和了一些：“告诉他，他的看法有问题。”（邦德仿佛亲眼看到了当时那一幕。）“但是，既然你现在已经回到伦敦了，多值值班也没什么坏处。别再疲疲沓沓的了。”

邦德倒也无所谓。第一周已经顺利过去了一半，到目前为止，他遇到的不过是些常识问题，或者他只需要把一些常规的问题传达给相关部门。他倒是挺喜欢这间安静的办公室，人们之间没有什么秘密可言，时不时还会有餐厅的某个漂亮女孩儿端来咖啡和三明治供他们享用。

在他值班的第一个夜晚，那女孩儿给他端来了一杯茶。邦德有点严厉地看了她一眼：“我不喝茶。不喜欢这个味儿，泥土味儿。而且，茶叶也是造成大英帝国没落的主要原因。你就做个好人，给我拿杯咖啡来吧。”女孩儿咯咯笑着跑回餐厅把邦德的话宣扬了一番。从此之后，大家都知道他爱喝咖啡了。“一杯泥土”这个说法也在办公楼里传播开来。

邦德喜欢这漫长而无聊的夜班还有一个原因，那就是他终于有时间进行一项他已经慎重考虑一年多的大工程——写一本介绍徒手格斗各种招数的书，书名就叫《保命秘籍》。书中将会囊括世界各国情报部门关于这个话题的精髓。邦德从没对任何人提起过这个计划，但他确实希望，如果他能写完这本书，M能够允许将之加入情报局的指南书目，那么就会使之成为情报局介绍计谋和手段的指导书籍之一。

邦德从档案室借了一些老教科书，以及书中一些关键信息的译注。这些书大部分都来自于敌国的特工组织。也有一些是由盟国情报部门，如美国宇航局、美国中央情报局和法国国防部情报局提供的。不久前，邦德得到了一件珍贵的战利品，一本小册子的译本，书名叫《防御手册》，由“间谍之死”——苏联的复仇死亡组织发行。

那天晚上，他正看到了第二章的一半，这一章的题目意译为“顺势擒拿手”。现在，邦德又翻开了书，花了半小时的时间读完了“顺势腕击式”“顺势臂锁式”“前臂锁”“头部擒拿”以及“颈部压力点的应用”。

半小时之后，邦德将手中的打印本扔到一边，站起身来，走到窗前，向窗外望去。从俄国人编写的这本短小的书中，他们令人作呕的粗暴可见一斑。它让邦德情不自禁地回忆起10天前在迈阿密机场时，自己难以摆脱的那种厌倦的情绪，他到底是怎么了？

他是不能继续胜任这份工作了吗？还是他不再冷酷坚强了？或者他只是有点儿倦怠了？一时间，邦德静静地站在那儿，看着月亮在云层之间穿梭。然后，他耸了耸肩，回到了书桌前。他感到自己对肢体上的各种暴力对峙都感到厌烦了，跟心理分析师见到心理失常的病人时产生的厌倦情绪是一样的。

邦德又继续阅读那篇引起他反感的文章：“用拇指和食指抓住下唇就可以搞定一个醉酒的女人。只要用力掐拧，并往前拉，她就会被制服了。”

邦德咕哝着：“拇指和食指。”他点燃了一支烟，吸了一口，眼睛出神地盯着桌上的台灯发出的光线，将思绪转向了别的事情，真希望此时能收到从哪里发来的什么信号或是电话铃声响起。离9点钟向参谋总长或是M报告离岗——如果M能在9点之前到的话——还有五个小时。他总是觉得有什么事一直侵扰着他的思绪，是一件他一直迷惑而又想要揭开谜团的事情。到底是什么事呢？是什么又让他此刻想起了这件事呢？哦，对了！“食指”——金手指。他想查查档案，看看有没有关于这个人的信息。

邦德拿起那部绿色的电话，拨通了档案室的号码。

“抱歉先生，没有接通，我检查一下线路然后给您打回去。”

邦德只能放下了听筒。

火车上的旅行可以说是非常愉快的。邦德和吉尔·玛斯特顿一起吃了三明治，喝了香槟。然后，在内燃机发出的巨大轰鸣声中，他们在狭窄的卧铺上做爱，甜蜜而又缠绵。看样子这个女郎已经很久没有享受过性爱了。在那个夜晚剩下的时间里，女郎又用自己的欲望将他叫醒了两次，她没有说话，只是抚摸着他那精悍坚实的躯体。第二天早晨，她又两次将窗帘拉上，遮挡住强烈的阳光，抓住他的手说：“爱我吧，詹姆斯。”那神情就像是一个孩子在向他索要糖果。

直到现在，邦德耳边似乎还回荡着那火车经过平面交叉路口时清脆的银铃声，火车头发出的汽笛声以及火车到站时车厢外“嘁嘁喳喳”的喧哗声。当时，他们就躺在卧铺上，等待着车轮再次飞驰时发出的“咣当咣当”的声音。

吉尔·玛斯特顿说，金手指对邦德取得的胜利表现得有点漠然，一点都不兴奋。他让吉尔转告邦德，他一周后会回到英国，到时候他希望在桑德威奇跟邦德打一场高尔夫球。仅此而已，没有威胁，也没有咒骂。他说希望吉尔能乘下一班火车返回。吉尔告诉邦德她打算如约返回。

邦德试图说服她改变主意。但她一点都不怕金手指：他能把她怎么样呢？而且这确实算是份挺好的工作。

离开的时候，杜邦一边絮絮叨叨表示着感谢和祝贺，一边往邦德手中塞了1万美元。邦德把这些钱都给了吉尔。“我不需要这些钱，”邦德说，“拿着也没什么用。你就当作自己的私房钱吧，万一临时想要出逃还能应应急。我不会忘记昨晚和今天的。”

邦德与吉尔在车站分别，他重重地在她唇上吻了一下，转身离开了。两个人之间的感情可能算不上爱情吧，但当邦德乘坐的出租车从宾夕法尼亚车站缓缓驶出的时候，他脑子里浮现出一句老话：“爱情似火，爱情如冰，但最真最纯的爱情正是肉体的欲望。”没有什么可悔恨的。他们两个犯了错吗？如果答案是肯定的，那么犯的又是什么错？违反了贞操吗？邦德对自己笑了笑。关于这个问题，他又想到了一位名叫奥古斯特的圣人的一句名言：“噢，主啊，给我贞操吧！但不是现在！”

绿色的电话响起了铃声。“一共查到三个名叫金手指的，先生，不过其中两个都已经去世了，第三个是在日内瓦工作的俄罗斯情报人员。对外身份是开美发店的。传递情报的手法是趁给顾客扫身上的碎发时顺手把情报塞到顾客右边的衣服口袋里。他在斯大林格勒受过伤，失去了一条腿。关于他还能查到更多信息，您还有进一步的需要吗？”

“不用了，谢谢。肯定不是我要找的人。”

“我们明早可以通过刑事调查局的档案进行进一步调查。您有那个人的照片吗，先生？”

邦德想起了他用莱卡相机拍的那张照片。他还没有把它洗出来。有他的影像的话肯定更容易找出来。他说：“画像室现在能用吗？”

“能用，先生，我来为您安排。”

“多谢，我马上下来。”

邦德通知电话接线员他的去向，以防各部门主管在需要的时候找不到他。然后，他走出办公室，乘坐电梯去了二楼的放映室。

正是深夜时分，整座大楼里出奇的安静。但在这表面的平静之下，还是能捕捉到各种机器以及一些隐秘活动发出的细微的声响——一间屋子的门背后传来隐隐约约的打字机打字的噼啪声，另一间屋子的门背后又传来无线电发出的“哧啦哧啦”的声音，同时还伴随着排风系统发出的呜呜的声音，这种感觉就好像身处一艘停泊在港口中的战舰上一样。

档案室的值班员已经将放映室里的投影机打开了。他对邦德说：“先生，请告诉我这个人面部的主要轮廓。这样我们就可以快速筛除那些明显不是的人了。”

邦德依言照办，之后便坐下来目光注视着屏幕。

画像仪是一台能够将嫌犯的大致面貌画下来的机器，哪怕这个人只是被目击者在大街上、火车上，或是行驶的汽车上看到了一眼。它的工作原理就是幻灯技术。操作员会将各种大小、各种形状的头部线条投射到屏幕上，如果目击者觉得哪个线条与嫌犯的特征相像就把它留下来。然后，同样道理，依次把各种发型、眼形、鼻子、下巴、嘴型、眉毛、脸庞、耳朵等各部位的影像投射到屏幕上，一一进行筛选，最终得到一张脸的全貌。只要是目击者能够记住的细节都能展示出来。最后，工作人员给这张相貌图拍下照片，放入档案。

将金手指奇特的面部特征组合到一起着实花了一些时间。但是，最后得到的成果还不错，这张相貌图看起来就像是金手指的一张黑白照片。这个过程中，邦德只是口述了一两个金手指的特征，比如古铜色的皮肤，头发颜色以及眼神之类的。

“要是在漆黑的夜晚碰见这么个人可不是件开心的事儿。”档案室的值班员这样评价金手指的相貌，“刑事调查局一上班我就给他们送过去，估计您在明天中午就能知道结果了。”

邦德又回到了他位于八楼的办公室。在地球的另一端，此刻正是午夜时分。东方站已经关闭了。在处理了一堆杂乱的信号，写完了当晚的值班记录之后，就已经是早晨八点了。邦德给餐厅打了电话，让他们准备早餐。他刚刚吃完，就听见桌上的红色电话响起了刺耳的铃声。是M！见鬼了，他怎么会提前半小时就到了呢？

“您好，先生！”

“007，到我办公室来一趟。我有事要跟你谈一谈。”

“是。”邦德挂掉电话，穿上外套，用手捋了捋头发。他通知了接线员他的去向，拿起值班记录，坐电梯上了九楼。性感的莫尼彭尼小姐和参谋总长都在。邦德敲了敲M的门，走了进去。

“请坐，007。”M像往常一样，点起了烟斗。他脸色白净，透着红晕。白色的衬衣领子笔挺，波点领结松松地系着，一张线条分明的脸上洋溢着轻松愉快的表情。邦德立马感到自惭形秽，自己脸上是黑黑的胡茬，因为彻夜未眠，皮肤也显得黯淡无光。他努力地将自己的思绪拉了回来。

“一夜平安无事吧？”M抽着烟斗，用他敏锐而健康的眼睛关切地看着邦德说。

“没什么事，先生。H站——”

M将左手稍稍举起了一两英寸样子，说：“没事，别麻烦了，我会自己看值班记录的。拿来吧。”

邦德将绝密文件夹递了过去。M接过来放到一边，脸上浮现了一丝罕见的略带嘲讽的微笑：“情况有变，007。从现在起，你不用再值夜班了。”

邦德微笑了一下作为回应，但是即使是微笑也掩盖不住他内心的紧张情绪。他仿佛感觉到自己的脉搏越跳越快，以前在这间办公室里他也经常体验到这样的感觉。M肯定有任务要派给他了。他努力保持着平静，说：“我才刚刚进入状态，先生。”

“你干得不错，以后还有的是机会。有情况出现了，是一项奇怪的任务。可能不是你擅长的方面，甚至算不上是——”M将手中的烟斗向旁边一挥，仿佛要将它扔出去似的，“你熟悉的方面。”

邦德靠着椅背坐着，没有说话，只是静静地等着。

“昨晚和银行主管一起吃饭。这人总是有些新奇的消息。至少，对我来说是新奇的。黄金——关于这东西的阴暗面的一些事，比如走私了、造假了，诸如此类。我先前都不知道原来我们英国的银行竟如此了解这些骗人的勾当。权当这是他们为了保护我们的资产所负有的职责吧！”M扬起眉毛说：“你了解黄金吗？”

“不了解，先生。”

“嗯，那今天下午就是个好机会了。今天下午4点，安排你与一个名叫斯密瑟上校的人在银行见面。此前的这段时间够你补一觉了吧？”

“够了，先生。”

“很好。好像这个斯密瑟是银行研究部门的头儿。根据主管透露给我的情况，他们这个部门跟一个间谍系统差不多，我也是第一次听说有这么个系统。你看，我们工作的区划还真是无懈可击。总之，斯密瑟带领他的手下们密切关注着银行界一切可疑的行为——尤其是关于我们的货币存储、金条存储之类的欺诈行为。曾经有一个意大利的团体负责用真金来铸造面值为一英镑的金币。但是，很显然，一枚铸好的一英镑金币或20法郎的法国金币价值要比把它们融化成同等重量的金子价值要高。别问我为什么，如果你感兴趣，斯密瑟会告诉你的。总之，银行雇了大批的律师对这个团体提出了诉讼——严格来讲，这都算不上是真正意义上的刑事犯罪——在意大利法庭上败诉之后，他们终于在瑞士胜诉了——你可能也看到过关于这件事的报道吧。之后，又出现了贝鲁特的美元保有额的事情，在报纸上闹得沸沸扬扬。我是理解不了这些事。好像是赖以保护我们的货币的措施出现了什么漏洞。找出这些漏洞刚好是斯密瑟的工作职责。现在，一桩严重的国内黄金外流案搞得斯密瑟相当头疼。他们靠着直觉和推理调查了一阵子了。但斯密瑟承认，他收获甚微。因此，他请求银行主管获得首相的批准让我们介入。”M停顿了一下，故弄玄虚地看着邦德说，“你想没想过在英国谁是最富有的人？”

“没有，先生。”

“嗯，那你猜猜看，或者应该这样问，谁是最富有的英国人？”

邦德努力地在记忆中搜索着。有钱人真是不少，或者说被报纸渲染的有钱人真是不少。但是，他们之中谁是真正在银行里拥有巨额存款的人呢？既然M问了，他总得回答。他支支吾吾地说：“嗯，先生，好像有个叫沙——逊的，还有个搞运输的叫什么——埃勒曼，据说考德雷大人也很有钱，还有些银行家——罗斯恰尔兹、巴林和马布罗丝，还有威廉森、那个做钻石生意的南非的奥本海默……还有一些公爵财产也很丰厚。”邦德说话的声音越来越小。

“不错，真不错，但你还是没说到点子上。要不是银行主管提起他的名字我怎么也想不到他，他才是最有钱的。他叫金手指，奥瑞克·金手指。”

邦德一时没忍住，放声大笑起来。

“怎么回事？”M的声音里带有一丝恼怒，“到底有什么好笑的？”

“不好意思，先生。”邦德努力控制住自己的笑声，“实际上，就在昨晚，我还在用画像仪弄他的画像呢。”他看了一眼手表，努力地让自己用平静的嗓音说：“现在，这份画像已经送往刑事调查局了，想通过他们调查他呢。”

M有点生气了：“这他妈的是怎么回事？别整天跟个小学生似的了，没个正形。”

邦德冷静地说：“嗯，先生，是这么回事……”他将事情的始末一五一十地和盘托出。

M脸上的表情渐渐变得明朗起来，他身子朝前探着，听到十分专注。

邦德讲完之后，M才放松身体，靠在椅背上，他嘴里喃喃地说着：“哦，哦……嗯。”他把手放在脑后，仰头盯着天花板长达几分钟之久。

邦德感觉自己又快忍不住笑了，等一下刑事调查局会怎么回复他呢？M接下来说的话猛地让他从沉思中回过神来：“对了，关于那一万美元你是怎么处置的？”

“送给那个女郎了，先生。”

“是吗？为什么没捐给白十字会(1)？”

“对不起，先生。”邦德并没有打算为此多做什么辩解。

“沉迷女色！”M对邦德沉迷女色这件事从来都不欣赏。对于他那维多利亚时代的思想来说，这种厌恶是深入骨髓的，不过他也决定不再追究了。他说：“好吧，就说现在的事，007。今天下午你就能打听到关于这个人的一切情况了。这个金手指，有趣又奇怪的家伙，我在布莱兹那里见过他两次。他在英国的时候会去那儿打桥牌，英伦银行正在调查他。”M停顿了一下，和善地望着桌子对面的邦德继续说，“从现在开始，你也得调查他了。”

第六章　关于黄金的会谈


邦德走上台阶，穿过精致的青铜色大门，步入了英伦银行那宽阔并且微微有点回声的门廊，环顾了一下四周。在他的脚下，鲍里斯·安瑞思(1)设计的马赛克图案金光闪闪，华丽夺目。在门廊的另一边，是一扇大约20英尺高的拱形窗户，从窗户向外望去，庭院中央绿草茵茵，天竺葵绽放得绚丽夺目。左右两旁都是宽宽的郝普顿伍德石(2)。空气中弥漫着一种淡淡的空调的气味，站在这里可以使人感受到这蕴含着巨大财富的地方散发出来的一种沉重庄严的气氛。

一个外表像运动员一样，穿粉红色长款工作制服的门卫向邦德走了过来，说：“您好，先生。”

“我约了斯密瑟上校。”

“您是邦德中校吧？这边请。”门卫走到右边的两根柱子之间。一架不太显眼的电梯已经开门等候了。电梯向上运行了几英尺到达了二楼。电梯正对着的是一条长长的走廊，尽头是一扇高高的窗户。走廊的地面完全由米黄色的威尔顿机织绒头地毯覆盖。走廊里是一排橡木的木门，刻有精致的雕花，比普通木门要高得多，也高档得多。门卫走到最后一扇门前，敲了几下。房间里，一个头发花白的女人坐在桌边。她看到邦德仿佛吃了一惊。屋子的几面墙边都摆满了灰色的金属文件柜。那个女人当时正在一沓四开的黄色备忘录上写着什么。

她饱含深意地笑了笑，拿起电话，拨了一个号码。

“邦德中校到了。”她放下电话，站了起来。“您请到这边好吗？”她来到房间的另一边，将一扇覆盖有绿色台面呢的门打开，请邦德进去。

斯密瑟上校从座位上站起身来，严肃地说：“感谢您的到来。您请坐吧。”邦德在椅子上坐了下来。

“抽烟吗？”斯密瑟上校将一个装着皇家海军牌香烟的小银盒子从桌面上推到邦德面前，而他自己则坐下来开始装烟斗。邦德拿了一支烟，点上了。

斯密瑟的样子和邦德想象中差不多。他显然是个上校，也许还是个参谋，他看起来表情温和，举止优雅，神态庄重，这些特点跟他的名字都很相配。但是，从他戴着的框架眼镜看，他也很有可能是一个在王室家庭里手段高超、从不满足的献媚者。

邦德感受到了这个房间里越来越浓的无聊气氛，于是他先开口挑开了话头：“听说您找我来是要跟我谈谈黄金的事情。”

“是，我明白。从主管那儿都听说了，我不该对你有任何隐瞒。当然，您也应该明白，”斯密瑟上校的目光越过邦德的右肩，看着邦德的身后，“我待会儿要告诉您的情况大部分是绝密的信息。”他的目光很快地扫视了一下邦德的面部。

邦德脸上没有任何表情。

邦德故意一言不发，斯密瑟上校感觉到了他的沉默。上校抬起头看了邦德一眼，意识到自己失言了，于是赶紧补救：“当然，对于您这样一个训练有素的人，我说这话有点多余了……”

邦德答道：“我们通常都只把自己的秘密看成是秘密。您这么提醒我一下是明智的。别人的秘密对于自己来说永远显得不是那么重要，但是您不必担心。您跟我讨论的问题我只有可能跟我的上司汇报，跟其他人一概不会提起。”

“好，好！您能这么看真是太好了。银行这个工作环境让人有时候会有点神经质。那么，”斯密瑟上校迫不及待地切入主题，“关于黄金生意，我想您以前没怎么考虑过吧？”

“从来没有。”

“啊哈，没错，那么关于黄金，您最应该了解的特性就是，它是这个世界上价值最高，也最容易营销的商品。无论您到了哪个城镇，甚至是哪个小村庄，您只要拿出一块金子，就能换到您要的东西或服务，对吗？”斯密瑟上校的语气突然变得轻松愉快起来，眼睛也显得神采奕奕，他兴致勃勃地讲述着自己的观点。

邦德靠在椅背上，他很乐意倾听别人对他们所擅长话题的评论，任何话题他都不排斥。

“还有一点就是，”斯密瑟上校举起手中的烟斗，仿佛在警示着什么，“黄金实际上是不可追踪的，金币上根本就没有序列号。如果说金条上会铸有铸币厂的记号的话，那么这记号也很容易被刮掉，或者，他们也可以把金条融掉再铸成一根新的。这样的话，如果想要追寻这些金子的下落，追溯它们的来历，追踪它们在世界上流动的路线几乎都不可能。比如在英国，每家银行只能掌握自己和其他银行金库里以及铸造厂里的黄金储量，而对于珠宝商和典当行手里的黄金就只能进行粗略估算了。”

“您为什么这么关心英国拥有多少黄金呢？”

“因为黄金和货币决定着我们在国际上的信用度。只有了解我们货币真实的币值是多少，才能知道我们的英镑有多坚挺。而我的主要工作，邦德先生，”斯密瑟上校本来和蔼的眼神突然变得尖锐起来，“就是监视任何黄金外泄到国外的情况——我说的国外是指英国货币流通范围之外的任何地方。一旦我发现有黄金外泄的情况出现，也就是说，在某些国家，黄金的交易价格比我们的官方价格要高的话，那么，我就必须要请刑事调查局黄金稽查组介入，让他们将外泄的黄金追回，归还国库，并且截断黄金外泄的渠道，逮捕相关责任人。但是难办的是，邦德先生，”斯密瑟上校无奈地耸了耸肩说，“黄金的巨大魅力总是能够吸引人们进行最大规模的，设计最为精巧的犯罪活动。要想破获真的是很难很难！”

“这种情况难道不是暂时的吗？为什么黄金总是短缺呢？非洲那地方每天都能挖出不少金子啊，怎么还是不够流通呢？对于其他一些物品而言，如果供给增加了，那么黑市自然也就没有存在的必要了，就像战争结束之后，盘尼西林不再紧俏一样。黄金难道不遵循这个规律吗？”

“情况恐怕不是这样的，邦德先生。事情没有您想的那么简单。世界上的人口以每小时5400人的速度增加。这些人当中的一小部分会成为黄金收藏者，他们总是对货币不放心，喜欢将一些金币埋在花园里或床底下，还有一小部分人还需要用金子来镶牙，还有需要金边眼镜的、黄金首饰的、订婚戒指的……这些形形色色的人每年都会导致大量黄金从市场上流失。工厂还需要黄金制作的金线、金板以及一些合金。黄金的属性决定它每天都会被派上不同的用场。它金光闪闪、延展性好、柔韧度高、形态稳定，除了铂金以外，它比任何普通金属密度更高。它的用途可以说是无穷无尽。但是，它也有两个缺点，一是硬度不高，容易磨损，很容易因为与衣服口袋的摩擦或是汗水的浸泡而损耗，每年世界上的黄金存储量都会因为磨损而无形减少。我刚才说了是有两个缺点，另外的一个就是，它是恐惧的护身符。人们的恐惧，邦德先生，使得黄金退出流通，人们将它囤积起来，以备不时之需。在动乱的时代，人们都不知道明天会是什么情况，从世界的某个角落挖掘出来的黄金马上又被埋进了另外一个角落，这种现象也不难理解。”

对于斯密瑟上校的侃侃而谈，邦德报之以微笑。这个人以黄金为生命，对黄金日思夜想。不错，这是个很有意思的话题。他生命中的一切就是在黄金里翻滚着。当初邦德与那些走私钻石的人打交道的时候，他就领教过这亮晶晶的石头所具有的魅力和神奇的力量了。他说：“在您向我解释您目前遇到的问题之前，您还有什么需要向我介绍的吗？”

“您还没听厌吗？您刚才话里的意思是现在黄金的生产量已经很大了，应该足以满足这些形形色色的消费者了。但是不幸的是事实并非如此。实际上，世界上的黄金快要被挖尽了。您可能会认为世界上还有大片的区域可以开采金矿，但事实不是这样的。据粗略估计，现在仅存的产量可观的金矿只存在于海底了，人类在陆地上开采黄金的活动已经有几千年的历史了。以前的大金矿主要在埃及、迈锡尼(3)、蒙特苏马(4)和印加这些地方。大富豪们和迈达斯(5)穷尽了中东区域内的黄金。在欧洲，像莱茵河谷、波河(6)、马拉加(7)以及格拉纳达平原(8)这些地方也都被挖了个遍，塞浦路斯、巴尔干这些地方都不例外。在印度，因为有人看到蚂蚁从地下钻出的时候携带着黄金碎屑，于是冲积平原上有大批人蜂拥而至，掀起挖金狂潮。罗马人把威尔士、德文郡和康沃尔都挖了个遍。在中世纪，墨西哥和秘鲁这些地方也出现了淘金人的身影。后来，又有了黄金海岸的开放，后来改名为黑人地。在此之后，美国人也加入了淘金的队伍。育空(9)和艾多拉多(10)的淘金热潮举世闻名，尤瑞卡巨大的财富冲击在第一次现代黄金时代中也是大名鼎鼎。与此同时，在澳大利亚，本迪戈和巴拉瑞特也开始出产黄金。俄罗斯在乌拉尔地区勒拿河的开采业，使俄罗斯成为19世纪中期世界上最大的黄金出产国。紧接着，随着南非威特沃特斯兰德金矿的发现，第二次黄金时代到来了。这个时代，开始采用利用氰化物代替汞将黄金从矿石当中提炼出来的新技术。我们现在处于第三个黄金时代，是以奥兰治自由邦(11)的金矿开采为标志的。”

斯密瑟上校双手向上一扬，继续说：“现在，地球上的金矿几乎被开采一空了。为什么？那些曾经称得上是人间天堂的克朗代克河(12)、霍姆斯特克(13)以及艾多拉多等黄金产地的黄金总产量加起来也就与非洲两三年的产量相当。您看，从1500年到1900年，据粗略计算，全世界出产了大概一万八千吨黄金。从1900年至今，我们已经挖出了四万一千吨！照这个速度，邦德先生，”斯密瑟上校身子前倾，诚挚地看着邦德，说：“您别说是我说的，但是说50年内我们能够把地球上的黄金全部挖光，我一点儿都不会感到吃惊。”

斯密瑟上校关于黄金历史的讲述让邦德觉得有点透不过气，他脸上的表情不禁变得像斯密瑟上校一样严肃起来，他说：“一定是您的讲述让这个故事听起来更让人揪心了，情况可能没有您想的那么严重。现在都能做到在海底开采石油了，也许不久以后他们也能攻克在海底开采金矿的技术难关呢。现在，咱们说说这个走私的事情吧。”

这时，电话铃声响起了。斯密瑟上校不耐烦地拿起听筒：“我是斯密瑟。”他越听，脸上恼怒的表情也就表现得越明显。“我确定我已经把暑期体育比赛的记录给过你了，菲尔比小姐。下一场比赛是在周六，对贴现公司队。”他停下来又听了听电话那头的话，“好吧，如果弗雷克夫人不愿当守门员的话，那她只能当替补了，我们只能让她打这个位置了。不能谁都打前锋啊。好吧，麻烦你。请告诉她就这一次，我真的很感激。她表现肯定会超级棒的，她最适合了。多谢了，菲尔比小姐。”

斯密瑟上校拿出手帕擦拭了一下额头，说：“真的很抱歉。现在银行系统的体育活动和福利活动简直有点泛滥成灾了。我刚刚成为女子曲棍球队的负责人。好像即将开始的年度赛马会还不够我忙似的。对了——”斯密瑟上校努力地驱除了这种恼怒的情绪，“你说得对，我们是该谈谈这个走私的问题了。嗯，首先，对于英国和整个英国货币流通地区来讲，这生意真算是规模不小。我们银行系统的职员有3000人，邦德先生，其中光交易控制部门就有1000多人。这些人中有至少500人，也包括我的小团队在内，参与控制涉嫌外汇非法流通的活动，有走私的，也有违反交易控制部门规定的。”

“这可不是个小数目。”邦德心里粗略地估计了一下，他们情报部门总员工数也就2000左右。“关于走私您能不能举个例子？关于黄金，关于这美元诈骗的手法我不是很明白。”

“可以。”斯密瑟上校现在的语气温柔而略带疲惫，这很符合他为政府服务的身份。这种语气正是执法人所特有的，用这样的语气说话说明他非常了解这一行，即便是他不了解的情况，也能凭经验猜个八九不离十。邦德对这种语气是再熟悉不过的，它是一流的国家公仆的标志。尽管斯密瑟上校这个人有点无聊，但是邦德还是对他产生了一丝好感。

“好吧，假设您有一根金条，大约5.25磅重。不管它是怎么来的吧，是您偷来的、继承的遗产还是什么，是24k金的，也就是我们说的千足金。现在，法律规定了您必须要以每盎司20英镑10便士的控制价把它卖给英伦银行。那这根金条也就卖1000英镑左右。然而，您又对此不满足。碰巧您有个朋友要去印度，或者您跟某个航空公司的飞行员或远东运营部门的某个干事关系不错。那么您可以将您的金条切割成小片儿或小块儿——您很容易就能找到可以帮您做这种加工的人——然后把这些小块儿或薄片的黄金缝到一个棉布腰带里，再付给您的朋友一些佣金让他把这腰带戴在身上。他们的佣金动辄上百英镑。您的朋友会乘坐飞机飞往孟买，进入集市上随便一家金店。您那五磅重的金条在那里可以卖到1700英镑，这样您就能比在国内卖拿到更多钱了。您注意，”斯密瑟上校轻快地晃了晃手中的烟斗，“这才多了70％的利润，在战争刚结束的时候，利润能高达300％。您只要一年这么干上五六回，那您就什么工作也不用做了，提前退休享受生活就行了。”

“印度的金价为什么那么高呢？”其实邦德并不是真的对这原因那么好奇，他只是觉得回头M可能会问到这问题。

“说来话长。简单说吧，比起其他国家，印度黄金短缺的情况更加严重，可能因为他们的珠宝买卖生意吧。”

“这种走私方式走私的数量有多大？”

“很大。这么说吧，1955年，印度情报局和海关一共缴获了43000盎司的走私黄金，我怀疑这个数字连总走私量的1％都不到。黄金从世界各地源源不断地涌入印度。最新的走私伎俩是从澳门用飞机运送到印度，然后通过使用降落伞将之投放到一个接收点——每次一吨——就像我们在战时给抵抗部队投放补给一样。”

“明白了。除此之外，还有没有其他渠道可以让我将黄金卖出高价呢？”

“大部分国家都可以，比如瑞士。但是收益太小，有点不值，印度还是最好的选择。”

“好吧，”邦德说，“我想情况我已经大概了解了，那您面临的问题是什么？”

他靠在椅背上，点了一根烟，心里想着，估计要听到奥瑞克·金手指这个名字了。

斯密瑟上校眼中呈现出了强硬而狡猾的目光。他说：“有一个人在1937年来到了英国。他是来自里加(14)的难民，名叫奥瑞克·金手指。他来英国时才20岁，但他头脑聪明，因为他竟然预见到不久之后俄国人就会吞并他的祖国。他的父亲和祖父都是为法贝热(15)提炼黄金的，因此他也是做的珠宝和黄金生意。他身上没多少钱，但很有可能拥有一条我刚才向您提起的装满黄金的棉布腰带。我敢说，肯定是从他父亲那儿偷来的。不久之后他就归化了——当时他是个对社会无害的伙计，做着有益的生意，钱来得也并不困难——然后，他开始收买全国范围内的当铺老板。他在里面安插自己的心腹，付给他们优厚的报酬，并将店铺改名为‘金手指’。之后，他又将这些店铺转型，售卖一些廉价的珠宝，并且回收黄金。您肯定见过这样的地方：‘回收黄金，价格从优，大小通收。’他创造了独具特色的广告语：‘卖了奶奶的项坠，买个订婚戒指，把她娶回家。’金手指做得不错，他很会选址。他的店铺都开在富人区和中等收入人群的交界处。他从来没有涉嫌过欺诈偷盗之类的，在各地的警察那里都赢得了好名声。他长期住在伦敦，每个月巡视一次他的店铺，收集各种旧黄金。他对珠宝这方面的生意不怎么上心，就随他的经理们任意处置了。”斯密瑟上校略带戏谑的表情看着邦德。“您可能觉得像金项坠、金十字架这些都是些小东西。没错，但是如果一个人拥有20家小店铺，每个店每星期收购大约五六件，也就积少成多了。随着战争开始，金手指像其他的珠宝商一样，也必须公布他囤积的黄金数量。我查了查我们从前的记录，整个连锁机构的总储量是50盎司。这个数量也就够他的金店制作戒指之类首饰用以出售的。当然，他有权利继续保有这些黄金。在战争期间，他转行在威尔士开了一家机械工具公司——远在战区以外——但同时也尽可能地维持着他的金店生意。当然，如果没有那些总是随身携带一只金鹰装饰或一枚价值50美元的墨西哥金币的美国大兵的话，生意肯定会更好一些。战争结束后，金手指搬家了。他在泰晤士河口的雷古弗买了一所大房子。他还买了一条建造精良的布里克瑟姆(16)拖网渔船和一辆劳斯莱斯银精灵汽车——是一辆装甲车，本来是为南美的某位总统特别制造的，结果车还没有送到，他就遭到暗杀了。他在自己的地盘上开了一家叫作‘泰奈特合金研究公司’的小工厂，并且聘请了一位德国的冶金家，这人是个德国的战犯，战后不想回国。除此之外，他还从利物浦招聘了五六个韩国的搬运工。他们都不懂英语，所以完全不用担心他们泄密。十年来，我们唯一了解到的就是，每年他都会坐他的拖网渔船去一趟印度，还会开车去几趟瑞士，他在日内瓦附近开了一家分公司。他金店的生意也尽量维持着，但是已经不再亲自回收黄金了，而是把这个活儿交给了他雇佣的那几个韩国人其中的一个，他还教会了那个韩国人开车呢。我承认，金手指不是个诚信可靠的人，但是他很注意自己的行为，与警察之间也维持了很好的关系。在这么一个恶霸横行的国家，他根本不会过多地吸引别人的注意力。”

斯密瑟上校停顿了一下。抱歉地看着邦德说：“我的话没有让您感到厌烦吧？我只是希望您能更好地了解这个人——他安静、细心、遵纪守法，他身上的那种干劲儿和专注让我们每一个人都钦佩不已。我们是通过他遇到的一次小事故才认识了他的真面目。那是1954年的夏天，他乘坐他的拖网渔船从印度返航，在古德温沙洲(17)登陆，然后将坏掉的船以很便宜的价格卖给了多佛海难救援公司。当这个公司开始拆除这艘船的残骸时，他们发现用于造船的木材之中灌注了一种棕色的粉末，但是谁都认不出这种粉末是什么物质。他们将样品送到当地的化学研究机构进行检验，检验结果显示这些粉末竟然是黄金。这真是让他们大吃一惊。说到这儿我还得向您介绍一下工作原理，黄金可溶于一些氢氯氮酸的混合物以及一些弱化介质——如二氧化硫和草酸——凝结之后就成了一种棕色的粉末。经过大概1000摄氏度的高温熔化，这些粉末就可以重新被铸造成为金锭了。除了小心融化过程中产生的氯气外，整个过程都很简单。”

“这个救援公司的员工一向多嘴，这件事很快就传到了多佛海关的耳中，并且惊动了警察局和刑事调查局。一份报告最终被送到了我的手中，附带一份金手指印度之旅装载的货物清单。他们报告的装载货物是用于制作肥料的矿物质粉末——这种解释方法显得真实可信，因为现在的肥料在制作过程中确实会使用微量的矿物质。整个事情现在再明白不过了——金手指将他回收来的黄金融化，将之凝结成为这种棕色的粉末，当作肥料运送到印度。但是，我们能据此给他定罪吗？不能。我们秘密检查了他的银行往来余额和纳税申报单，在拉姆斯盖特的巴克莱银行有两万英镑。每年的个人所得税和附加税都是按时缴纳的。从数据上看，就是一家再正常不过的运营良好的珠宝生意商。我们派了两名黄金稽查小组的成员乔装打扮，敲响了金手指位于雷古弗的工厂大门。‘不好意思，先生，劳动部小工程部门常规检查。我们需要确认您的工厂运营是否遵守了安全健康条例。’

“‘请进！请进！’金手指对他们表示热烈欢迎。您请注意，他事前很有可能已经受到银行经理或什么人的暗示了。检查的结果是他的工厂生产的全部都是便宜的合金首饰——实验用铝和锡之类廉价的金属代替铜、镍以及钯等用于制造合金的传统的原料。当然了，这里面也含有微量的黄金，并且也是用熔炉加热到了2000摄氏度左右的温度来炼制的。毕竟，金手指就是一个珠宝商，一个合金制造商，生产这些合金并不是什么违法乱纪的事情。我们的黄金稽查小组一无所获，失望而归，我们的执法部门在找不到更多的证据之前也没有办法仅凭这些棕色粉末就对他提起公诉。好像他就可以这么逍遥法外了，除非——”斯密瑟上校摇了摇手中的烟斗，继续说，“我能调取档案，从世界各家银行调查更多的证据。”

斯密瑟上校停了下来。从他身后墙上高高的窗口，传来了扩音器隆隆的声音，正在播放着这个城市的名字。邦德偷偷看了一眼手表，时间是5点整。斯密瑟上校从椅子上站了起来，双手手掌向下放在桌面上，身子向前探出，说：“邦德先生，我花了5年的时间才查清楚了，金手指是英国拥有黄金最多的人。在苏黎世、拿骚、巴拿马以及纽约这些地方，他在保险柜里存了价值两千万英镑的黄金。而且，邦德先生，这些黄金并不是由铸币厂铸造的。上面没有任何官方的标记，也没有来源的标注，它们是由金手指自己融化铸造的。我乘飞机去了拿骚，亲眼看到了他存在加拿大皇家银行的那些价值大约五百万英镑的黄金。说也奇怪，像其他艺术家一样，他也克制不住在他的作品上签上自己名字的冲动。他的签名很小，但是如果你用显微镜仔细观察就会发现，在每一块金手指铸造的金条上，都刻有一个小小的Z字。那些金条，或者说那些金条中的大部分，都是属于英国的，银行都无权处置。所以，邦德先生，我们现在想请您来将金手指正法，把这些黄金归还英国。您也知道现今的货币危机和高银行利率吧？所以，英国肯定是迫切需要这些黄金的，而且是越快归还越好。”

第七章　坐在阿斯顿马丁轿车里的思考


邦德跟斯密瑟上校一起走到电梯门口。在等候电梯的同时，邦德从走廊尽头高高的窗户望出去，看到了银行后院里的那口深井。一辆深棕色的货车穿过铁门开进院子，从车上卸下了一些方形的纸壳箱子，一条短短的传送带将这些箱子运送到了银行大楼里。

斯密瑟上校走过来看了看说：“面值五镑的钞票，刚从劳顿的印刷厂运来的。”

这时，电梯来了，他们一起走了进去。邦德说：“我不怎么喜欢新版的钞票，看起来跟外国的纸币没什么区别，旧版钞票是世界上最好看的了。”

他们一起穿过门厅，现在那里已经亮起了微弱的灯光，显得有点冷清。斯密瑟上校说：“其实我也是喜欢旧版的。问题是，战争期间德国国家银行制造的伪币太逼真了。当俄国人攻占柏林的时候，他们得到的诸多战利品中就包括纸币的铅版。我们曾要求国家银行归还，但是遭到了拒绝。我们和财政部都认为这种情况太危险了。所以，我们不得不收回旧版五镑纸币。新版的虽然不耐看，但至少没有假币。”

值夜班的警卫将门打开，他们走下了台阶。门口的针线街已经看不见什么人影了。城市已经被夜幕笼罩。与斯密瑟上校道过别后，邦德走向了地铁。他以前从没想过会跟英伦银行打什么交道，但是经过今天的内部探查，他发现这个位于针线街的机构虽然老旧，但也还没到不可救药的地步。

按照计划，邦德在6点的时候向M进行了汇报。经过了漫长而令人疲惫的一天，M的脸色已经不再粉红，也失去了早晨那奕奕神采。当邦德走进房间，坐在M办公桌对面的椅子上时，他注意到M显然在努力地保持着头脑清醒，以应对这一天当中出现的各种新问题。M在他的椅子上直了直身子，拿起烟斗，问：“怎么样？”

邦德非常了解他这种强打精神的语气。他用了不到五分钟的时间将整个事情的概貌复述了一遍。

他讲完之后，M若有所思地说：“先假设我们接下了这项任务吧。貌似大家对此都很重视，但是我们对英镑和银行利率这些东西都不了解。我个人一直认为英镑的坚挺与否应该取决于我们经济的发展情况，而不是取决于我们拥有多少黄金。战后，德国拥有的黄金没有多少，但是你看他们在10年的时间里发展了多少。但是，对于政治家来说，这么解释这个问题未免太简单了点。对他们来说，这不是一个很好解答的问题。你想好用什么办法对付这个金手指了吗？你想用什么方法接近他，承诺帮他做些什么见不得人的勾当还是怎么着？”

邦德想了想，说：“先生，我不会想方设法去奉承他的，比如主动请求为他做什么啊之类的。据我了解，他这个人比较尊敬比他更强更聪明的人。在上次与他的较量中我已经胜出了。那次接触中，他提到要跟我打高尔夫球。目前看这是唯一的机会了，我最好抓住这个机会。”

“我的得力干将们绝佳的消遣方式。”M的这句“广告语”中略带一些讽刺的语气，“好吧，去吧！但是按照你的说法，你最好还是得打赢他，想好用什么说辞了吗？”

邦德耸了耸肩，说：“我还没想好呢，先生。要不我就说我正在考虑离开环球出口公司吧，感觉在那儿没什么前途。所以现在趁着休假四处转转，考虑移民加拿大呢，已经受够这里了，诸如此类的吧。但我想我还是循序渐进地把这些信息说出来吧，我觉得他不是那么好糊弄的。”

“好吧，随时报告进程。别以为我对这件事不感兴趣。”M的语气和表情都发生了变化，在他的眼神里可以看到一丝急迫和严厉。“我再提供给你一条银行方面没有提供给你的信息吧。由于一个偶然的机会，我了解了金手指的金条是什么样的。实际上，我今天还有机会摸了摸——上面就刻着一个Z字。上个星期，位于丹吉尔的雷德兰居民主管办公室‘失火’了，我们趁机缴获的物品中就包括这么一根金条。回头你会有机会亲眼看看金条上的那个标志。这是战争结束后我们通过自己的途径获得的第20根这种金条。”

邦德打断说：“但是这根来自兰吉尔的金条是从‘间谍之死’那里得来的，对吗？”

“是的，我验证过了。其他19根这种刻有Z字样的金条的来源也是‘间谍之死’。”M顿了一下，又继续用温和的语气说，“你知道吗，007？如果最后调查的结果金手指并不是‘间谍之死’的外国银行家而是他们的财务主管的话，我也一点儿都不会感到吃惊的。”

在最后几英里没有转弯的路段上，邦德开上了阿斯顿马丁DBIII，在罗彻斯特拥堵的一个小上坡路段上，又急速地换到三档，进而又换到了二档。汽车仿佛累坏了似的，发动机发出了轻微的类似咕哝的声音。邦德又一次挂上了三档，在坡脚把大灯打开，将车开近了堵车队伍的末端。即便顺利，要想穿过罗彻斯特和查塔姆至少也得需要一刻钟的时间。

邦德又换上了二档，让车慢慢向前溜着，同时伸出手拿过旁边座位上装着莫兰香烟的青铜盒子，摸索着拿出一根用点烟器点燃。

他选择的去桑德威奇的路线是A2号公路，而不是A20公路。因为他很想看看金手指的地盘——那片紧邻泰晤士河的区域。然后，他将穿过塔奈特的伊勒，到达拉姆斯盖特，将行李留在帕克特海峡，早早吃过午饭，之后再朝着桑德威奇出发。

汽车是由组织提供的。除了这辆阿斯顿马丁DBIII之外，还有一辆捷豹3.4可供他选择。不管是哪辆车都很符合他的伪装身份——一个生活富足，富有冒险精神，喜欢尝试生活中一些高质量、高速度事物的年轻人。相比之下，DBIII的优势在于，它具备一张最新日期的汽车临时入境证，除此之外，它的颜色也不那么引人注目——是跟战舰颜色类似的灰色；并且车上还装备了一些小物件，说不定什么时候就会用得上，包括一个能够改变邦德前后车灯形状和颜色的开关，以备他在夜晚跟踪或被跟踪的时候使用，还有从车头到车尾全方位加固的保险杠，以备他需要与物体撞击的时候使用，司机座位下面还有一把长枪身的45式柯尔特自动手枪；另外，它还配备了一台“霍默”——是一种无线电信号接收器，车上的隐秘空间也够大，足以让他在需要的时候躲过海关的盘查了。

邦德发现了一个机会，加速往前冲了五十来码，快速插到了一辆起步较慢的家庭轿车前面。那辆轿车的司机头上端端正正地戴着一顶帽子，一看驾驶技术就不怎么样。因此被邦德超了车，他非常气愤地狂按喇叭。邦德将拳头伸出窗外，朝空中挥了挥，后面的喇叭声终于平息下来了。

那么，M的说法到底有没有道理呢？好像还是有些道理的。众所周知，俄国人在给他们的人发放酬劳方面一向做得不好。他们的组织总是遇到财政困难，他们甚至会向莫斯科抱怨他们都吃不饱肚子。估计国家安全部没有能力向“间谍之死”提供足够的资金支持。或者也有可能是因为财政部没有及时将资金发放到国家安全部。不管是哪种情况，它的后果就是他们资金方面陷入了困境，进而导致了错失良机、失信于人等一系列后果，特工人员所冒的风险和付出的努力也都白白浪费了。因此，如果能在俄罗斯范围以外找到一个聪明而又具有经济头脑的人，不仅能够帮助“间谍之死”筹集到资金，并且还可以创造巨大的利润以保证这个组织在不需要莫斯科的经济援助的情况下在海外正常运作，肯定也是一个不错的选择。所以，邦德实际上正在顺便摧毁一个敌对国的经济基础。这些设想实际上非常符合“间谍之死”的典型特点——制订一个缜密的计划，由得力干将执行得完美无缺。

邦德猛踩油门，一路上坡将汽车开进了查塔姆，五六辆车都被甩在他的车身后面。他边走边想，刚才的设想正好可以解释为什么金手指对金钱有那种无休无止的贪婪和欲望了。正是由于这个原因，由于他对“间谍之死”的忠诚，或许也由于列宁发布的某个悬赏令，他才会有不断的动力追求钱财。一旦有了恰当的时机，他甚至连几万英镑都不会放弃。为了实现红色革命，为了维护“间谍之死”所一向擅长的恐怖式统治，多少钱都不嫌多。金手指不是在为自己赚钱，他是在为他的组织有一天能够征服世界而赚钱。相比之下，他为此所冒的风险——正如被邦德揪住了小辫子这种情况——就变得微乎其微了。为什么呢？就算是英伦银行将他以前的所有勾当都曝光出来，又能把他怎么样呢？

行驶到吉林厄姆郊外时，路上的车辆渐渐少了起来。邦德开起车来也觉得轻松了很多，他不紧不慢地行驶着，思绪也开始自由地徜徉起来。

所以，1937年，金手指肯定是受“间谍之死”之命，开始干用布腰带运送黄金的勾当。在列宁格勒的间谍学校接受培训时，他逐渐展示了自己在这方面的天赋以及他对金钱那种贪得无厌的欲望。当时，他肯定接到了指示——一场战争即将爆发，他必须全力以赴，悄无声息地开始他累积钱财的活动。金手指肯定没有做过杀人、联络特工、传送情报这样的事情。一些日常工作肯定有人帮他打理好。“二手沃克斯，一口价1000英镑”“完美无瑕的罗孚，2000英镑”“宾利，5000英镑”像这样的广告词总是无法吸引人们的注意力，引起人们共鸣的。价格显得太高，对车的描述又太少。这样的一则广告也许会刊登在《泰晤士报》这样的报纸上。看到之后，金手指就会在离开莫斯科之前将与广告上提到的价格相当价值的金条悄悄放在他们预先安排好的长长一排信箱当中的某一个中。或者，这个放置金条的地点可以是英国的某一座桥梁，一颗枯树，或是河流中的某块石头下面。而在他放置完之后，无论如何他也不会再回到这个地点，直到莫斯科派遣特工将藏好的宝藏从这里取走。后来，战争结束之后，金手指飞黄腾达，成了大人物，他的藏宝地点就不再是什么桥啊树啊的了。现在他收到的是一个明确的日期和一个保险箱号码或车站的行李寄放柜号码。但是，规则维持不变的部分是，金手指将金条放置好之后就不得回到那个地方了，决不允许他将自己置于一个危险的境地。也许他每年才会接收一次指令，方式可能是在某个公园里一次看似平常的会面，或是在坐火车的旅途中有人悄悄放在他衣服口袋里的一个纸条。但不管是通过哪种方式，放置金条的过程都应该是神不知鬼不觉的，并且一旦被查获，它的来源也应该无从查找。如果说整个过程中有一个小小的破绽的话，那就是金手指出于虚荣在自己的“作品”上刻上的那个Z字，而碰巧又遭遇了一个很难对付的名叫斯密瑟上校的英伦银行工作人员负责相关工作。

此刻，邦德正在法佛舍姆无边无际的果园之间穿梭。太阳从他背后徐徐升起，阳光穿透了伦敦的烟雾。在他的左侧，泰晤士河闪烁着粼粼的波光。河面上船来船往，交通繁忙——长长的闪着亮光的油轮、身材粗壮的商人、古老的荷兰侦察舰。邦德驶离了坎特伯雷路，驶上了一条修建得不错的道路，与这条壮观的道路显得有点不搭调的是路边的一些廉价的平房。这里是度假胜地——惠特斯特布尔、赫恩贝、伯青顿、马盖特等。他依然是以时速50英里左右的速度不紧不慢地行驶着，双手轻轻握着方向盘，听着排气筒里发出的轻微咕噜咕噜的声音，同时，将脑子里的一些印象的碎片像拼图一样联系在一起——就像他两天前值夜班的时候用画像仪拼出了金手指的面容一样。

邦德想，金手指每年向“间谍之死”输送高达一两百万的巨额资金的同时，也在努力建设着自己的队伍，在合适的时机，让这些人为自己所用。他也努力积累财富，以备克里姆林宫的号角吹响时能够做到调动一切力量奔赴前线。在莫斯科以外，几乎没有人知道这些情况的存在，从来没有人想到金手指——这个珠宝商、冶金家、雷古弗和拿骚的守法公民、备受尊重的布雷德俱乐部会员、桑德威奇圣马克俱乐部的会员——一直以来都是个阴谋家，全世界数以千计的受害者遭到的“间谍之死”的迫害竟是拜他所赐。只有M对此产生了怀疑，只有邦德了解了此事的内情。由于种种机缘巧合，邦德又碰巧与这个人针锋相对过。在他的职业生涯中，这种情况出现的概率有多高呢？就跟一颗橡子萌发嫩芽，穿透头顶足以遮天蔽日的橡树的枝枝杈杈，成长成为参天大树的几率差不多。而现在，他又得踏上征程，去人为地制造另一次的巧合。通过什么呢？就通过袋子里的那些高尔夫球杆。

邦德的前方有一辆重新油漆过的带有两个大大的黄色穗子的天蓝色福特车正顺着道路向前行驶。邦德礼貌地鸣了几下喇叭，声音很短促。前面的福特车没有任何反应，还是以时速40英里的速度行驶着。这样的速度似乎非常适中，但就是有人想要再开快点。福特车依然慢吞吞地在马路中间行驶着。邦德这次显得有点不耐烦了，汽车喇叭发出尖锐而响亮的声音。邦德希望这样能提醒前面的车为他让一下路。然而，福特车依然是没有反应，邦德被迫踩下了刹车。该死的！前面的司机肯定是这个样子：浑身肌肉紧张，手紧紧地抓住方向盘的上方，肯定也戴着一顶帽子，而且还是一顶难看得要命的礼帽，就像在一张大大的鞋拔子脸上套了一个四方块儿。不过，邦德想，这种人怎么能够难得住我呢？他轻蔑地笑笑，轻转方向盘，从内侧超过了那辆车。蠢货！

又往前走了5英里之后，邦德穿过了优美的海纳尔湾。伴随着呼啸(1)的声音，右手边高楼大厦被甩在了身后。三架“超佩刀”飞机在这一带上空盘旋。它们朝邦德右边的地面俯冲下去，仿佛要钻到地面以下。就在它们降落的同时，邦德听到又有喷气式飞机飞了过来。前面是一个岔路口，左侧的路标上写着“雷古弗”。路标下面就是雷古弗教堂的古老的纪念碑标志。邦德将车速降了下来，但并没有停车。他继续缓缓地向前行驶着，同时也睁大眼睛观察着。岸边光秃秃的，渔船在这里除了靠岸和抛锚以外什么都做不了。可能邦德太习惯拉姆斯盖特的情况了吧，而这里完全不一样，这是一个安静的小港口。这里的海关和警察可能只检查防范从法国走私的白兰地。在马路与岸边之间有一丛浓密的树木，隐隐约约能看到一些屋顶点缀其中，还有几个不大不小的工厂烟囱冒着薄薄的烟或蒸汽，肯定是这儿了。很快，邦德看到了大门前那长长的车道。一个牌子上写的字显得庄重而谨慎：“赛尼特合金”。下面还有一行字：“非请勿入”，看起来很体面的样子。邦德继续开车向前。

邦德到达目的地时已经是中午12点了。他查看了一下自己的住处，是一个位于帕克特海峡顶层带浴室的两居室。他打开简单的行李放好之后，就去了楼下的小吃店。在那里，他点了一杯伏特加，一杯奎宁水，还有两个加了足量芥末的火腿三明治。饱餐之后，他又开着车，慢慢地向桑德威奇的皇家圣马克球场驶去。

邦德带上球杆走进了高尔夫球商店，径直走进了工作室，阿尔弗莱德·布莱克正在给一根球棒缠上新的绑带。

“你好，阿尔弗莱德。”

阿尔弗莱德猛地一抬头，晒成古铜色富有光泽的脸上立刻露出了灿烂的笑容。“原来是您啊，邦德先生！”他们握了握手，“得有15或20年不见您了吧？什么风把您给吹来了，先生？听别人说您的工作是跟外交什么的有关，经常不在国内。呵呵，我可从来没出过国。您还是跟以前一样，习惯用平挥杆吗？”阿尔弗莱德·布莱克双手相握，做了一个低低的平挥杆的动作。

“恐怕是这样的，阿尔弗莱德。改不过来啦！布莱克夫人和塞西尔好吧？”

“没什么不好的，先生。塞西尔去年参加了肯特郡的冠军赛。如果他今年少在店里混，多上球场上练练，没准儿就能得冠军了。”

邦德将他的球杆靠在墙上。故地重游感觉还不错，一切都好像没有什么变化。记得他十几岁时，几乎每天都会在圣马克打上两洞球。布莱克总想着亲自指导他：“您只需要稍加练习，邦德先生，肯定就能成为高手。真的不骗您，您肯定会的。您现在这么打有什么意思呢？盲目地使用平挥杆，总是想把球打得飞出人们的视线，这些有什么意义呢？您资质不错。您如果让我指导的话，只要过上几年，也许只需要一年，我就能做到让您达到参加业余组大赛的水平。”但是，总是有一个声音告诉邦德，他这辈子所从事的职业跟高尔夫球没有什么关系，如果他真的喜欢这项运动，就不要抱有太多的期望，仅仅享受它带来的乐趣就好了。没错，他上次在圣马克球场打球已经是20年前的事了。这些年来，他都从来没有回来过。这次一想，他内心好像有点伤感的情绪了。后来，邦德在周末也经常在总部打高尔夫球。但也都是在伦敦附近的球场——汉特库伯、斯温利、森宁戴尔、伯克夏等。邦德的差点一度高达9杆。

“今天有比赛吗，阿尔弗莱德？”

阿尔弗莱德回头从他身后的窗户向外朝高高的旗杆旁的停车场望了望，摇了摇头，说：“估计够呛，先生。一年当中的这个季节，又不是周末，没多少人来打球。”

“跟您打可以吗？”

“不好意思，先生，我已经有预约了。一个经常来玩儿的会员，每天下午两点。而且塞西尔也去普林塞斯训练去了，为冠军赛做准备，您说有多讨厌（阿尔弗莱德从来也不会使用非常恶毒的词语）。估计您找不到对手了，您打算在这儿待多长时间？”

“时间长不了。没关系，我就带个球童自己打打算了。您今天要跟什么人打啊？”

“一位名叫金手指的先生。”阿尔弗莱德显得有点沮丧。

“噢，金手指，我认识这个人，以前在美国见过。”

“是吗，先生？”阿尔弗莱德脸上露出了难以置信的表情，“金手指怎么会这么出名呢，谁都认识他？”他仔细审视着邦德的表情，希望能获得更多的线索。

“他球技如何？”

“一般般吧，先生，差点9杆左右。”

“天天都打，看来他对这些比赛很在意啊。”

“嗯，您说的没错，先生。”此刻阿尔弗莱德脸上的表情对邦德来说是非常熟悉的。这样的表情说明，他对对方可能不怎么欣赏，然而出于他要做好服务的责任感，他也就不计较了。

邦德微微笑了一下，说：“您还是老样子，阿尔弗莱德。您的意思是，没有其他人会愿意陪他打球吧。您还记得法夸尔森吗？算得上是英格兰打球速度最慢的人了吧。我还记得20年前您奔前跑后地陪着他打球的情景。说说吧，金手指怎么个讨厌法？”

阿尔弗莱德放声大笑了起来，说：“我看您一点都没变，邦德先生，您一向就好奇心很强。”他朝邦德身边走近了一步，压低声音说：“先生，实际上，大家只是觉得这位金手指先生有点夸夸其谈，谎话连篇什么的。”他拿起球杆，摆好姿势，眼望前方，仿佛那里有个球洞一样，将球杆上下挥动着，模仿着击球的情景。“让我看看，这是个黄铜位吗？你怎么看，球童？”阿尔弗莱德·布莱克咯咯笑了起来，“当然了，他的球杆打在球后的地面上之后，球弹起一英寸，这就是黄铜位了。”阿尔弗莱德·布莱克收敛了脸上的笑容。不带有任何感情色彩地说：“但这也只是谣言，先生，我从没亲眼见过这样的情况。他是位绅士，从不张扬，在雷古弗有房子，从前在这儿常住。但是近几年只是时不时来英国住上几个星期。每次来了都会打电话来寻找对手进行比赛，实在找不到人就约塞西尔或者是我，今天早晨他又打来电话问有没有人来打。确实，时不时地也会有些陌生人过来打球。”阿尔弗莱德·布莱克满脸疑问地看着邦德，说：“我想您不介意今天下午跟金手指先生打打比赛吧。您来了又不打比赛总觉得怪怪的。您也认识这个人，或许他还以为我愿意赖着跟他打球舍不得放手呢！这样可不行。”

“别傻了，阿尔弗莱德，你也得谋生啊，咱们三个人一起打怎么样？”

“他不会同意的，先生，他说那样节奏太慢了，其实我也同意他的看法。您不用担心我的收入问题，现在店里的活儿多得是，要是我能有一下午的时间处理处理也不错。”阿尔弗莱德看了看手表，“时间差不多了，估计他马上就该来了。我给您找个球童吧，还记得霍克吗？”阿尔弗莱德一边说一边放声笑了起来，“他还是老样子，能在这儿与您重逢他肯定也像我一样高兴。”

邦德说：“好吧，阿尔弗莱德，那就多谢了。我也很愿意看看这家伙球技如何。您看您这么说可以吗？您就说我是个老会员，战前经常来这打球。今天来是想拿一根你们帮我定做好的球杆，说的自然点儿。别跟他说您向我介绍过他的情况了。我就在店里等着，免得他对我有什么偏见不愿意跟我打，万一他要是不喜欢我这个人呢，可以吗？”

“很好，邦德先生。这事儿就交给我吧。您看，那是他的车，来了！”布莱克指了指窗外。大约半英里以外，一辆亮黄色的轿车正从大路上拐下来，开上了俱乐部门口的车道。“他开的这车挺奇怪的，我小时候经常见咱们这儿有这样的车。”

邦德顺着他指的方向看去，一辆老款的劳斯莱斯银精灵正缓缓地向俱乐部开过来。这车真是漂亮！阳光照在车身和前挡风玻璃下方的铝板上，闪着耀眼的光芒。豪华而厚重的车身上，一对黄铜的行李架安装在了车顶上，两个卢卡斯“道路之王”大灯昂然面对着前方，还有两个长长的喇叭状的车笛，像两条蟒蛇一样匍匐在车身上，这样的装饰在20年前显得无比丑陋，而在今天又透出一丝怪异的美丽。除了车顶、轮廓线条装饰和车窗挡板是黑色之外，整个车身都是淡黄色。邦德突然想到朗斯戴尔领主曾经开着他那辆举世闻名的黄色轿车去参加德比赛马会和艾斯克赛马会，一位南美国家的总统看见之后还依样仿制了一辆。

而现在的这辆车里坐着的这个人身穿咖啡色衣服，戴着咖啡色帽子，那张又大又圆的脸上戴着护目镜，面容有点看不清楚。他身边一个矮胖的身影，穿着黑色的衣服，头上端端正正地戴着一顶圆顶硬礼帽。车里这两个人都一动不动地盯着正前方，好像他们开的是一辆灵车似的。

车越开越近，车上的六只眼睛的目光——车上两个人的眼睛加上车上的一对车灯——好像都一齐穿透了那扇窗户，直勾勾地注视着邦德的眼睛。

邦德本能地向后退了几步，站在了工作室里较为昏暗的地方。他注意到了自己的这个动作，不禁笑了笑。他拿起不知是谁的一根轻击棒，弯下腰来，在木地板上轻轻地随意画着图案。

第二部　巧合





第八章　打球是为了……


“下午好，布莱克，都准备好了吗？”声音听起来很随和，但又不失威严，“我见外面停了一辆车，不会是有人在找比赛对手吧？”

“我也不太清楚，先生，是个老会员，来定做一根球杆。您要我问问他吗，先生？”

“是什么人？他叫什么名字？”

邦德紧绷的脸上微微一笑，竖起了耳朵，他不想错过金手指语气中任何细微的变化。

“那位先生，名叫邦德。”

“哦，他啊。”他稍微停顿了一下，继续说，“他知道我要来这儿吗？”邦德从他的语气中能够听出明显有试探的意思。

“他就在店里，刚才可能已经看见您的车开过来了。”

邦德想，阿尔弗莱德从不会说谎，今天恐怕也编不出来了。

“可以考虑跟他打一场，”金手指说这句话的时候语气已经放松下来了。他想从阿尔弗莱德·布莱克那里打听点关于邦德的信息：“这家伙打哪种比赛？他差点是多少杆？”

“他小时候打得不错，先生。但是这些年我也没见识过他的球技了。”

“唔。”

邦德可以感觉到此刻金手指内心里真正仔细地衡量着。他感觉鱼儿马上就要上钩了。他伸手从包里拿出一根球杆，用一块虫胶擦拭着把手，总得装着在做点什么。邦德背对门口坐着，手里奋力打磨着。这时，他听到背后传来木地板被踩踏发出的咯咯吱吱的声音。

“我想我们以前见过面。”门口传来了一个低沉冷静的声音。

邦德飞快地回过头，说：“老天！您吓了我一跳。您是——”然后，邦德做出一个恍然大悟的样子，“是金……金……呃……金手指先生。”他一边说心里一边想，但愿没有演得太过夸张了吧。紧接着，他又说：“您怎么也到这儿来了？”语气里带有一丝不高兴和怀疑的情绪。

“我告诉过你的，我常在这儿打球，不记得了？”

此刻，金手指的眼睛睁得圆圆的，邦德又找到了那种被X射线一样目光穿透骨髓的感觉。

“不记得了。”

“我让玛斯特顿小姐带给您的口信您没收到吗？”

“没有，是什么口信？”

“我说我会在这儿等您，有机会的话咱们打上一场。”

“哦，呵呵，”邦德的语气礼貌而冰冷，“改天一定奉陪。”

“我今天本来要跟这里的陪练打呢，不如还是跟您打吧。”金手指没有说谎，说明他确实是上钩了，所以邦德想欲擒故纵。

“还是改天吧。我今天来是定做一根球杆的。很久不练习了，而且估计也没有球童吧。”邦德尽量装得粗鲁一些，但是显然，他最终的目的就是跟金手指打这场比赛。

“我也很久没打了，（邦德心想：这个死骗子！）定做球杆花不了多长时间。”金手指转身向门外大声喊道，“布莱克，能给邦德先生找个球童吗？”

“没问题，先生。”

“好，现在都没问题了。”

邦德无奈地将手中的球杆塞回袋子里，说：“那好吧。”他最后又想到了一个向金手指推辞的借口：“但是我得提前说明一下，我打比赛喜欢赌钱。要是只为好玩儿把球打来打去的我可受不了。”邦德心里为自己所树立起来的这个形象感到有点沾沾自喜。

金手指苍白的眼睛里似乎有亮光一闪，那是胜利的喜悦吗？他有点冷漠地说：“正合我意。我们爱好还挺一致的。关于差点，我记得您说过您的是9杆，对吗？”

“是的。”金手指说，然后又赶紧小心翼翼地追问了一句，“我能问问在哪个场地吗？”

“汉特库伯。”邦德在森宁戴尔也是9杆，汉特库伯这个场地还要更好打一些。在汉特库伯是9杆的差点，这对金手指来说还没有什么可怕的。

“我在这儿也是9杆，你看，布告栏上写着呢，所以我们应该是棋逢对手啦。”

邦德耸了耸肩，说：“我怎么能与您相提并论呢！”

“我可不这么看，”金手指语气里带有明显的不友好的情绪，“告诉您我的打算吧。您在迈阿密讹走的我那笔钱，还记得吧？一万美元。我这个人喜欢赌博，所以我希望试一试。今天如果我输了，我再给您一万美元，如果我赢了，上次的一万美元您就得还给我了。”

邦德淡淡地说：“这赌注也太大了。”他假装想了想，仿佛考虑到自己也有赢的可能，装出一种狡诈而又不情愿的语气，说：“但是要说起来这钱本来也不是我的。要是输了也没什么可遗憾的，来得容易去得也快。也好，那就比吧，一万美元，就是它了。”

金手指转过身去。突然换了一种亲切和蔼的语气，说：“那就都准备好了，布莱克先生，非常感谢，把费用记在我的账上，今天没法跟您打了真是遗憾，球童的费用我也付了。”

阿尔弗莱德走进工作室，拿起了邦德的球杆，注视着邦德的眼睛说：“还记得我跟您说过的话吧，先生。”他一只眼睛眨了一下，使了个眼色，“我是指您的平挥杆，您得注意一下，多多注意。”

邦德对他笑了笑。阿尔弗莱德是个好打听的人。从他刚才听到的内容，他可能无从判断整件事情是怎么回事，但是他大概也了解了这是一场很重要的比赛。“多谢了，阿尔弗莱德。我会记住的。四支笔——文件夹——把要点记在上面。再拿一打球座，我可不是要做会议记录。”

邦德走出商店，走到车旁。那个戴圆顶硬礼帽的人正在拿一块布擦拭着劳斯莱斯的车身。邦德没有转头看他，但是凭感觉明显知道那个人停下了手中的动作，看着邦德从车里拿出包走进了俱乐部。那个人长着一张黄皮肤的方脸。难道是那几个韩国人之一吗？

邦德将场地使用费交给了一个叫汉普顿的服务员，然后走进了更衣室，扑面而来的是熟悉的气味儿——黏腻的旧鞋旧袜子的气味儿和陈年的汗味儿。

为什么即使是最著名的高尔夫俱乐部，环境卫生也停留在维多利亚时代的私立学校水平呢？这几乎成了一种传统。邦德换了袜子，将一双破旧的撒克逊钉鞋穿在脚上。然后，将身上已经有点儿发黄的黑白相间的棋盘格花纹的外套脱下来，换上了一件有点褪色的黑色防风夹克，他摸了一下香烟和打火机，一切准备就绪了。

邦德慢慢走出了更衣室，同时为比赛酝酿着情绪。他为什么要诱使金手指打一场高难度的比赛呢？其中一个目的就是想借此机会促使金手指对他产生更多的敬佩之情，并且希望金手指对他想树立的这种冷酷坚强的冒险分子的形象留下更为深刻的印象，以此判断他能为金手指所用。邦德本来计划赌一千英镑就可以了，但是却赌了一万美元！除了美国冠军赛决赛或加尔各答业余挥杆大奖赛那种奖金发放给赞助者而非运动员的比赛，估计历史上不会有赌注这么高的单场比赛了。金手指的私人账户有过“不良记录”，他不喜欢输钱，因此肯定迫切地希望能把自己的钱捞回来。所以，当邦德提到想赌钱的时候，金手指觉得机会来了，那就赌吧。但是不管怎样，有一点是肯定的，那就是邦德无论如何也输不起。

他回到店里，从阿尔弗莱德那儿去拿球和球座。

“霍克已经给您拿走球杆了，先生。”

邦德走在刚刚割过的海边的草皮上，向第一个球座慢慢走去。金手指正在推杆场地上进行练习。他的球童站在旁边，不断给他摆球。金手指用的是新式的推杆法，将长柄推杆放在他的双腿之间。邦德信心增强了一些，他不看好这种方法，认为自己练习没有什么作用。他的旧胡桃木球杆——“卡拉米迪·简”状态时好时坏，他对此也没什么办法。他也知道，圣马克的练习场地与比赛场地无论在速度还是质地方面都没有什么相似性。

邦德看到了他的球童脚步轻快、无忧无虑的身影，他正在场地上逛来逛去。“下午好，霍克。”

“下午好，先生。”霍克将一根球杆递到邦德手上，扔掉了三个坏球。他脸上那种敏感而讽刺的表情立马变成了一种略带嘲弄的微笑，对邦德迎了上来：“您平时怎么保持的，先生？过去20年里在哪儿打过高尔夫吗？您现在还能把球打到发令员的屋顶上去吗？”他说的是有一次，在比赛开始前，邦德两次将球打到了发令员所在的小屋的窗口里去了。

“咱们试试看啊。”邦德将一根球杆握在手中掂了掂，测量了一下距离，练习场地上的球塞已经不见了。邦德发球，他快速挥杆，然后抬起头，球的飞行角度几乎完美。他又试了一次，这次很不成功，一块草皮飞了起来。球向前滚了大概10码远。邦德转身看了看霍克，他脸上那种讥讽的表情再明显不过了。

“得了吧，霍克。那些是打给别人看的，这杆专门打给你看。”他走到第三个球前面，缓缓地将球杆抽回，快速地击打。球飞出了大概一百多英尺，然后优雅的停止，往下掉落了八英尺左右，准确地落在发令员的茅草屋顶上，又掉落到地上。

邦德将球杆递回给霍克。霍克的眼神若有所思，似笑非笑，什么都没说，抽出球棒递给邦德。他们一边向第一个球座走去，一边谈着霍克的家人。

金手指也走过来加入了他们，看起来很放松又对什么都漠不关心的样子。邦德问候了一下金手指的球童。他叫福克斯，是个健谈而又善于阿谀奉承的人，邦德从来都不喜欢他。邦德扫了一眼金手指的球杆，那是一套全新的美国本·霍根思球杆，木质的部分配有精致的带有圣马克标志的皮革套子。金手指用的包也是特别受美国自由职业者欢迎的黑色皮革缝制的手提包。每根球杆都装在一个纸质的套子里，方便抽出使用。这套装备算得上是豪华，但却算不上是最好的。

“正面反面？”金手指扔起一枚硬币问。

“反面。”

结果却是正面。金手指拿出了他的球棒，剥开了一颗新球。他说：“邓禄普65，最棒的球。我只用这一种，您呢？”

“滕佛尔德爱心。”

金手指认真地看着邦德，说：“严格按照高尔夫规则打吗？”

“那是自然。”

“好吧。”金手指走到球座前，准备发球。他先做了一两次认真而专注的挥杆练习动作。邦德非常了解他的这种动作——那种老套的、死板的挥杆——只有那些认真学习过这项运动、读过相关书籍、并花五千英镑的高额费用请过专业教练的人才做得出来。这种挥杆动作保证运动员即使在压力巨大的情况下也能打出好球、高分球，邦德有点心生嫉妒了。

金手指站好位，优雅地左右晃动着，将球杆向后慢慢地挥出一个大大的弧度，同时目光一直停留在球上，手腕非常恰当地发了力。他呆板地、毫不费力地将杆头向下挥动，打在球上，收尾动作标准漂亮。球笔直地向前飞去，落在大约200码外的球道上。

这次击球如此精彩，对邦德来说可不是件乐观的事。由此可以预见到，金手指能够绕着18个洞口用不同的球杆一次次地重复这样的击球。

邦德站好位，用了一个矮球座，小心翼翼地放好球，打出了一个跟网球运动员挥拍的姿势相似的平挥杆，为求稳，手腕用力比较大。球飞了出去。这一杆打得不错，而且很有威胁，球超过了金手指的球后，又往前滚了50码。但是这一杆也算不上完美，最后落在了左边深草区的边缘。

两个人开局都不错，现在轮到有些焦躁的金手指打球了。邦德把手中的球杆递给霍克，悠闲地散起了步。此时，他知道在这五月晴朗的天气里，伴着百灵鸟的歌声，在这世界上最好的海滨球场上，一场高尔夫球拉锯战已经开始了。

皇家圣马克球场的第一洞有450码长——全是起伏不平的球道，中间有一个沙坑，第二杆打得不好就会陷在里面，果岭上也有四分之三是有沙坑的。你也可以让球从没有沙坑的那片区域绕过，但是那块儿的球道有一个向右的倾斜度，很有可能第一杆就将球打进旁边的深草区结束比赛。金手指看样子是准备好要试试这种打法了。邦德看见他大概是拿出了一根勺状杆，做了两次挥杆练习，放好了球。

很多我们认为打不了高尔夫的人都能参与到这项运动中来，包括盲人、一只胳膊的人、没有腿的人等，而且人们打球的时候很多都穿着奇装异服。其他球员也不会认为他们穿得奇怪，因为关于打高尔夫的服装本来就没有什么统一的标准。实际上，服装也是打球过程中的一个小小的乐趣。但是金手指总是希望在打球时打扮得精致一点，这让他显得与整个的环境有点不协调。唯一跟他头上铁锈红色带扣子的粗花呢高尔夫球帽相搭配的就是他那头浓密、火红的头发和脚上那双擦得油亮的橘红色皮鞋。那条七分马裤的完美剪裁引人注目的程度已经远远超过了裤子样式本身。他脚上穿了一双杂色的长筒袜子，还带有吊带。我们几乎可以想象，金手指去他的裁缝那里说：“给我做身打高尔夫穿的衣服，就像苏格兰人穿的那样的。”一般来讲，邦德不大注意社会风俗这方面的因素，因此他也就发现不了什么问题。

但是，事情一涉及金手指就不一样了。从邦德第一次见到他那天起，这个人身上的所有细节邦德都希望自己能够透彻理解，他这种高调张扬的穿衣风格是从一开始就吸引邦德关注的诸多因素之一。

金手指又在进行他那呆板而毫无破绽的挥杆了。球飞了起来，降落的时候却没能绕过斜坡，球的行进线路马上向右弯曲，停在了浅草区的边缘，这样很容易就能打成五杆球了。如果能够再打一个好的高球就能打成四杆球，但是打好也不容易。邦德走到自己的球旁边，它就在球道旁边的斜坡上面。邦德拿出他的四号杆，是时候开启“全高球模式”了——让球飞得又高又远，这样再有两杆他就能打成四杆球了。邦德不禁想起了专业人士的宣言：“什么时候赢球都不嫌早。”他比较放松，心里盘算着不必追求那种令人感觉舒服但是节奏缓慢的模式。

邦德这杆一打出去，自己立刻就知道不行了。一杆球打得好与坏，就像一个漂亮女子和长相普通的女子之间的区别一样。这一杆，就是球杆头与球接触的位置低了那么一厘米。球的飞行弧度高而无力，好像脚下没根似的。刚才怎么没有想到使用一根勺状球杆呢？真是见鬼了。落下的球刚好碰到了远处一个沙坑的边缘，往回滚了一截。这时，裁判的哨声响起，比赛进行了正好一半了。

关于这杆愚蠢的坏球，邦德没有懊恼多长时间。他很快忘记了这一杆，开始考虑下一杆怎么打了。他走到沙坑边，拿出工具，测量了一下球到球洞的距离，20码。球正好落在一个凹陷处。他是应该大力挥杆将球击出呢？还是采用从外向内发力的方法呢？但是第二种打法很可能会带起一块沙土。为了求稳，他还是决定采用大力挥杆击打的方法。邦德走到沙坑里，大力挥杆向球打去——高尔夫中最容易的打法——用力用到极致。这一杆他希望能将球打到目前位置与目标杆之间一半的距离，于是当球杆头接触到球的那一刹那，他手上不由自主地加了把劲儿。球的高度不够，落在斜坡上又向回滚了一截。把它打出来啊，大笨蛋，用一杆远距离的轻击。结果，邦德这一杆打起了太多的沙土。球倒是打出了沙坑，但也只是落到了果岭边缘的位置。金手指向他的球弯下腰去，杆头向下挥去，直到球向球洞方向滚动了一半的距离他才停下了动作。球在距离球洞三英寸的地方停了下来。不等邦德轻击，金手指马上转身背对邦德，向第二个球座走去。邦德捡起球，从霍克手里接过球棒。

“他说他的差点是多少，先生？”

“9杆。我们两个水平相当。但是现在看我得打得更好点才行。该拿出第二洞用的勺状杆了。”

霍克鼓励他说：“时间还早呢，先生。”

邦德知道，其实时间不算早了，输球的苗头出现得越早越不是好事。





第九章　盆地与边缘


金手指已经放好了球。邦德跟在他后面慢慢走过去，霍克紧紧相随。邦德停下来靠在他的球杆上，他说：“我想您说过咱们要严格按照规则打球。但我还是要让您做这次推杆，这能给您增加一分。”

金手指轻轻点了一下头，马上又开始了他的那套练习程序，进行了他那精彩而又保险的击球。

第二洞是一个长达370码向左弯曲的路线，如果你敢打老虎线的话，必须要穿过一个深深的横向的沙坑。但是当时有着轻轻的微风，可能会略有帮助。对于金手指来说，在第二洞可以使用五号铁杆。邦德决定拼一下，简单一点，就用一根适用于绿地的楔形铁头杆。他将球杆后扬，用力击打在球上，球直直地向着沙坑飞去。微风对飞行的球起到了一点助推的作用。球落入浅草区的一个沟槽，看不见了。四杆球，打得好也有机会成为三杆。

金手指什么也没说，大步朝前走去。邦德也大步上前，赶了上去。“您的旷野恐惧症是什么表现？这样宽阔的地方对您不会有影响吗？”

“不会。”

金手指向右走去。他看了看远处若隐若现的杆旗，盘算着第二杆怎么打。他拿出了五号杆，很小心地打出了一杆好球。球落入了左侧的深草区。邦德很了解那个区域。如果打得好，金手指能打成两杆。

邦德向他的球走过去，拿出楔形铁头球杆将球轻击到了果岭上，球在途中跳跃了几次。球超过了球洞，在球洞前一码的位置停了下来。金手指打出了一杆很精彩的球，但是却偏离球洞25英尺的距离。邦德这一洞得到了两杆，他没有等对方击球就走上前轻击，球在距离球洞一英寸的地方停了下来。金手指走出果岭；邦德击球入洞。

现在两个人平局了。

第三洞长度为250码，地面高低不平，比较难打。邦德拿出一根木质球杆，打出一个好球。这球预计不是落在果岭上也是落在果岭附近。金手指的击球依然优秀，但是略显动力不足，没能成功越过最后高低不平的路段，滚落到了果岭上的一个洼坑里。显而易见，金手指的球刚好是位于一段崎岖不平的地段的一个小土丘上。此处地形恶劣，球刚好在一个小坑里面，后面还有一丛植物。金手指站在那儿看了看球的落点。他似乎狠了狠心，从球童手中拿了一根球杆，左脚将球后面的那丛植物踩平，这样他就可以使用推杆将球击出向球洞滚去。球在距离球洞三英尺的地方停了下来。

邦德皱了皱眉，打高尔夫的时候，如果对手作弊，唯一的补救办法可以说就是再也不要跟他打球了。但是现在这一招却不能奏效，邦德本来也不想再跟金手指打球。而且，除非他逮到金手指再做出什么令人更加难以容忍的事情，否则跟他进行什么“你这样了我没有怎么怎么”的争辩也没有什么意义。邦德所需要做的就是尽力打赢这场比赛，不管是通过作弊还是什么。

现在，邦德的20英尺的轻击必须要进洞，他必须要誓死一搏了。通常来讲，这种情况下，球手一般都不会让球过洞，停在洞前合适的距离就可以了。邦德打这一杆费了不小的力气，大汗淋漓。他将金手指的球撞开，继续给其制造些可能打不进洞的球，然后时不时地再让他进一个，这个球看起来要显得难一些。

依然是平局。

第四洞长460码。球手需要将球打过全英国最高最深的沙坑，然后用一杆长距离击球，让球越过一段起伏不平的球道，最终到达高处平坦的果岭，在进入果岭之前有一个斜坡，一般需要三杆而非两杆才能打过。

邦德还是像往常一样，第一杆将球击出了50码，而金手指用了两杆精彩的击球将球打到果岭下面的沟槽中。邦德决心要赢下这一洞，他没有拿3号杆而是拿了一根木质杆，越过果岭，几乎走到了场地的边缘。从那里开始，邦德用了三杆结束了这一洞。

第五洞球道也很长，邦德最喜欢的就是在这块球场上的第二杆——球需要越过沙坑，穿过高高的沙丘之间的一个沟槽，最后到达远处高高的旗杆那里。这个球道是非常考验球手技术的，因此第一杆的成功是至关重要的。邦德站在球座旁边，在高高的沙丘上稍事休息。他望了望远处闪着粼粼波光的海面和佩格威尔湾外那新月形的白色悬崖，然后，站好始发姿势，眼睛盯住他的目标——草皮的网球场。他慢慢举起球杆，以保证在球杆头碰到球之前有足够的时间让他揣摩何时发力最合适。他听到右边哐啷一声闷响，但是要停下来已经太晚了。旁边飞来一颗误击的球，击中了邦德的头部，这是一记高高的钩形球。这球飞到哪儿去了？快起来！快起来！球落到起伏不平的地面上一个突起的小丘，又弹了起来。它会滚到球道那边吗？

邦德转身面向金手指和球童，目光犀利。金手指正在直起身子，若无其事地看了看邦德，说：“抱歉，球杆掉了。”

“别再这样了。”邦德简短地回答。他离开球座将手里的球杆递给霍克。霍克同情地摇了摇头，邦德拿出一支烟点上了。

金手指将球打出了200码，这是规则允许击打距离的极限了。

他们一起走下了小丘，谁都没说话，突然金手指出人意料地打破了沉默：“您在哪家公司工作？”

“环球出口公司。”

“这家公司在哪儿？”

“伦敦雷金特公园。”

“出口什么产品？”

邦德突然之间从他的愤怒中清醒了过来。对了，注意！这是比赛，可不是闹着玩儿的。好吧，他打乱了你打球的节奏，但是你的掩护故事可不能这样被打乱了。不要因为受到他的干扰而在这方面犯错误，一定要把故事编圆满。邦德漫不经心地说：“小到缝纫机大到坦克，什么都卖。”

“那您负责什么？”

邦德明显可以感到金手指紧盯着自己的目光，说：“我主要负责轻武器部分。我大部分时间都是在向那些阿拉伯酋长和印度的王侯们——凡是那些外事办公室认为不会对我们形成威胁的人们吧——推销五花八门的铁器。”

“这工作挺有意思。”金手指的语气显得平淡而无聊。

“不怎么样，我正考虑辞职呢。这次到这儿来度一个星期的假就是要把这事儿考虑清楚，感觉在英国没什么前途，考虑去加拿大发展呢。”

“是吗？”

他们穿过了起伏不平的路段，邦德发现他的球竟然穿过了小丘到达了球道上。球道稍稍向左弯曲，邦德的球甚至还在金手指的球之前几英尺。现在轮到金手指打球了，他拿出三号杆，这一杆的目标不是打上果岭，而是让球越过沙坑，穿过沟槽。

邦德等待着金手指像往常一样的精彩击球，他看了看自己球的位置。好，他可以用他的木质杆。突然，他听到一声失误球发出的闷响。是金手指的球，沿着地面急速向前滚去，落到了“地狱沙坑”里，这是球场上最宽也是最为凌乱的沙坑，上面有很多鹅卵石。

霍克点了一下头，或者说，只是抬了一下头。可能他的思维还停留在邦德跟他说的那些话上。表现不错！但是金手指还是有可能三杆结束比赛。邦德拿起他的球杆，求稳的打法他玩儿不起，做好击球准备，脑子里构思着球的飞行轨迹，它将穿过沟槽，然后弹跳两次，跃上果岭。他向右移了一下，挥动了球杆。就是现在！

右侧响起了轻柔的叮当声，邦德离开球座。金手指此时正背对邦德站着，眼睛盯住海面，陷入了全神贯注的沉思，右手下意识地玩弄着口袋里的几枚硬币。

邦德露出了讨厌的神色，笑着说：“您就不能等我把球打出去再倒腾您的金子吗？”

金手指既没有回头也没有说话，但是硬币的声音停下来了。

邦德又转回身，准备击球，他拼命地试图清空脑子里的杂念。他觉得使用木质杆风险太大，太要求高超的技术了。他将它递给霍克又拿起了他的三号杆，稳稳地将球打过了沟槽。打得不错，球落在果岭前，五杆球，也有可能打成四杆。

金手指将球打出了沙坑，之后打成了死球。邦德用力过大，也没能进洞。

还是平局。

第六洞，被恰当地称呼为“处女洞”，是高尔夫界闻名的最短的一洞。果岭很窄，并且四周几乎全部被沙坑围绕着。根据风力不同，球手在这里需要使用八号杆或二号铁杆等不同球杆。今天，邦德需要用的是七号杆。他打出了一记高球，故意稍稍偏右了一点，好让风将它带回一点。球在超过旗杆20英尺的地方停了下来，在高难度的一击之后，落在了山肩下。应该是三杆球了。金手指拿起他的五号杆，打了一个直杆。借着风力，球滚落到了左侧的深沙坑里。这对邦德来说是个好消息！这样的情况打得最好也就是个三杆了。

他们平静地朝果岭走去。邦德朝沙坑里瞥了一眼，金手指的球落在一个深深的鞋跟形的坑里。他一边听着云雀的叫声一边走到了自己的球边，想找霍克拿他的推杆。然而霍克此时正在果岭的另一边，全神贯注地看着金手指打球。金手指拿着球杆下到了沙坑里，跳了一下看了一眼球洞，然后低下头来准备击球。金手指的球杆挥起的那一刻，邦德的心也随之一紧。他要竭尽全力将球从那个深坑打出，这真是种孤注一掷的打法，唯一的希望就是打爆了。金手指球杆向下，不急不迫，稳稳当当。球杆几乎没带起多少沙土，球就沿着一个弧形的轨迹飞出了沙坑，弹跳了一下，成功了！

邦德咽了口口水。真是大跌眼镜！金手指是怎么做到的？现在，除了嫉妒之外，邦德必须两杆进洞了。他尽力尝试了，差一英寸没进洞，然后又滚过了一码。真他妈倒霉！邦德慢慢走上前轻击了一下，将金手指的球敲开。算了吧，你这混蛋！这种大起大落让邦德心情有点焦虑，恨不得用意志控制将球弄进洞里。而那不争气的球在洞口擦边而过，没有进洞。又失一杆。

此刻，邦德有点对自己生气，输掉这一洞的原因是他，就是他自己。20英尺的距离他竟然用了三杆。他必须要振作起来，继续打下去。

第七洞，500码。两人都打得不错。金手指用他那完美无瑕的第二杆将球打到了离果岭50码的地方。邦德拿起他的木质杆，现在是追平比分的好机会。然而他这一杆挥得有点高了，球没能飞得很高，直直地扎入了右边的一个沙坑里。这可不是个好落点，但他必须要把球打上果岭。邦德冒险尝试用七号杆打了一下，结果没能将球打出。金手指五杆进洞。

两杆落后了。

第八洞，他们都是三杆，平局。

打第九洞时，邦德希望能追到只落后一杆。结果也是在打一个落点不好的球时用力过猛了。金手指以四杆、少于邦德一杆的优势胜出。

三杆落后了，这可不是好现象。邦德让霍克拿颗新球。霍克慢慢地剥球，等着金手指翻过小丘走到下一个球座。霍克小声说：“您看见他在‘处女洞’那儿干了什么吗，先生？”

“看见了，妈的，打得确实精彩。”

霍克很吃惊地说：“怎么，您根本没看见他在沙坑里的所作所为吗，先生？”

“没有，怎么了？我当时距离太远了。”

这时，金手指和他的球童走上一个小丘，暂时看不见了。霍克什么都没说，静静地走到第九洞周围的其中一个沙坑里，用脚踢出了一个小洞，将球扔了进去。然后，他双脚并拢站在一半没入土中的小球后，抬头看着邦德，说：“您还记得他击打前跳起来看看了球洞的事吗，先生？”

“记得。”

“您看好了，先生。”霍克看着第九洞的旗杆跳了起来，跟当时金手指的动作一样。落地之后，他又抬头看着邦德，手指了指脚边的球。双脚跳起产生的冲击力使得刚才放球的小坑一下子被震平了，球也就被挤了出来。现在，球的位置放得很好，很容易击打。难怪金手指在“处女洞”那里貌似绝不可能把球打得出来，结果他却打得那么好。

邦德沉默地盯着他的球童看了一会儿，然后说：“非常感谢，霍克。把球棒和球给我。今天这场比赛一定会有人败得一塌糊涂，但那个人绝不能是我。”

“是，先生。”霍克说，语气有点麻木，沿着一条近路朝第十洞的球道走去。

邦德慢悠悠地踱过小丘，朝第十洞的球座走过去。此时，金手指正站在球座前不耐烦地用他的球杆抽打着。邦德都没有抬眼看他一下，努力地清空着脑子一切，只剩下冷酷和决心。从比赛开始以来，他第一次感觉到无比自信。他只需要上天给他的一个征兆，就能将比赛打得风生水起。

皇家圣马克球场里最危险的地段就要数第十洞了。这里的第二杆需要将球打上一个又高又滑的果岭，果岭四周遍布大大小小的沙坑，边缘还有一个陡峭的悬崖。这样的地形曾令多少人在此心碎过。邦德想起了飞利浦·斯科拉顿，通常在高尔夫大奖赛的成绩是四杆或四杆以下，结果在这个球道上却打了十四杆，其中有七杆是将球从这个沙坑打到那个沙坑，围着果岭来回转。邦德知道，金手指将用两杆将球打到果岭四周的区域或是至少打到该区域附近，如果能用五杆完成比赛他肯定是求之不得。邦德必须尽力，四杆拿下这一局。

两杆之后，金手指的情况不错，已经将球打上了果岭四周的平地。有可能四杆就能进洞了。邦德拿出了七号杆，稍微停顿了一下，等风力合适的时候将球高高地打到了空中。起初，他觉得自己停顿的时间可能过长了，但是片刻之后，球便开始向左漂移。球劈起，然后落入果岭上一个从右手边的沙坑吹来的一堆软软的沙子上停了下来。一个十五英尺长的轻击球，难度较高。邦德下一杆如果能打过这一半的距离就很高兴了。果然，金手指将球推进到了离洞一码的距离之内。邦德一边击球一边想，自己这一杆得进洞才行。他潇洒地打出了一杆轻击球，希望球能越过沙坑，却惊恐地看见球像一道闪电一样飞速地越过了光滑的果岭。天啊，劲儿大了，这回还得用一杆把球推回两码才行了。但是突然之间，仿佛被某种磁力吸引似的，球突然改变方向，直朝球洞而去，撞到旗杆，跳了起来，格拉一声落入了球洞洞口。这就是上天的征兆！邦德走到霍克身边，向他眨了眨眼，拿起了球杆。

邦德和金手指离开球童，沿着斜坡走下去，一直走到下一个球座。金手指冷冷地说：“刚才那一杆本来应该滚出果岭的。”

邦德不客气地说：“总得给球洞一个机会吧！”他将球在球座上放好，然后乘着微风，打出了当天最好的一个球，一杆劈起球和一杆轻推。金手指这次发挥也正常，他们又一起向前走去。邦德说：“对了，那位漂亮的玛斯特顿小姐怎么样了？”

金手指直视前方，说：“她不在我那儿干了。”

邦德心想，这是好事，说：“哦，我想再联系下她。她去哪儿了？”

“我不能告诉您。”金手指离开邦德，朝他的球走去。邦德的球已经飞过了球道中间的那个山脊，从视线里消失了。现在它距离球洞不会超过50码的距离。邦德感觉自己了解金手指脑子里的想法，这是任何一个球手在嗅到球场上的好运即将消失的时候都会产生的念头。邦德看到金手指那老一套的挥杆加速时一点儿也不觉得吃惊。球落下来，落入了果岭左侧的沙坑。

现在，如果邦德让他的对手摆脱了困境，比赛也就就此结束了。结果邦德表现得非常强势，球在离旗杆六英尺远的地方停了下来。金手指也成功地将球打出了沙坑，但是长距离推杆的时候却打得不怎么样。现在，邦德仅仅落后一杆了。

狗腿形状的第十二洞他们表现都很一般，都是五杆。

长条形的第十三洞，邦德也是五杆，金手指如果想要平局必须要打出一杆好的轻击球。

现在，金手指那宽大平滑的额头上显出了一点进退维谷的神色。他站在第十四洞的球座旁边，拿起一瓶水。邦德在旁边等着，他不希望球飞出右边的边界，而当时的微风使球的飞行路线很容易变成曲线。邦德左手用力增加了挥杆的力度，放慢了挥杆的速度。偏向左侧的这一杆只能算是差强人意，但至少没有出界。而金手指似乎并不在意出不出界的问题，还是按照一贯的方式击球了。这一洞打下来，邦德依然是落后一杆。

现在，比赛只剩下四洞了。

第十五洞长460码。在这个球场上，喜欢打长距离球的球手只有在这一洞有希望一杆进洞。果岭对面竖起的两根撞击木让人很容易将球打进一连串的沙坑。金手指需要用他的第二杆将球打到沙坑附近，他最多能打成五杆。而由于邦德差强人意的第一杆，他在第二杆必须要打得非常精彩。

太阳开始西下了，四个人的影子也被拉长了。邦德站好准备姿势，这个球的落点不错。邦德开始击球了，将球杆来回挥动了两次，当时四周一片寂静。这一杆是关键的一杆。

记住，球杆挥到最高处时要停顿一下，向下挥动时要慢，球杆头击球要尽量迅速。邦德开始了将球杆向后挥动的动作。这时，他右眼的余光看到好像有什么东西在移动。金手指那颗巨大头颅的影子不知道从哪冒了出来，慢慢接近地上的球，将球遮住，并且还在继续移动。邦德慢慢停下手中挥杆的动作，从球那儿退后了一步，抬头看过去。金手指的脚步还在移动着，他正在专注地盯着空中。

“注意您的影子，金手指先生。”邦德嗓音里的怒火几乎快要控制不住了。

金手指停下来脚步，慢慢低头看了邦德一眼，眉毛微微抬起，仿佛正在询问似的。他收回脚步站好，什么都没说。邦德又走到球前。好，现在放松！让金手指见鬼去吧。一杆把球打上果岭，站好击球吧。曾经有一刻仿佛整个世界都静止了，然后……再然后邦德将球击打出去——球的飞行轨道很低，优雅而快速地向远处的沙坑飞过去。球撞击到果岭的边缘，由于冲击力弹跳起来，然后滚入了旗杆四周的浅碟形盆地里，看不见了。

霍克走上前来，接过邦德手中的球杆。两人并肩前行。

霍克带着认真的表情说：“这是三十年来我见过打得最棒的一杆球了。”他压低了声音说：“我觉得您更得小心金手指了，先生。”

“刚才差点就让他给算计了，霍克。是阿尔弗莱德·布莱克打出了这杆球，不是我。”邦德拿出烟，递给霍克一支，把自己那根点上，轻声自语：“现在是平局，还有三洞了。这三洞我们得格外小心。你明白我的意思吧？”

“您不用担心，先生。我会盯住他的。”

他们走上了果岭。金手指打了一根短而高的球和一个长距离的推杆，而邦德的球离洞口只有两英寸了。金手指捡起了自己的球，离开了果岭。

第十六洞两人都是三杆的成绩，又是平局。还有两洞就结束比赛了，打出两个四杆就赢了。邦德第一杆打得很棒，球正中场地中央。金手指打了一杆长距离球，球落入了右边的深草区。邦德努力压抑着内心喜悦的心情，尽量不过早地抱有过分乐观的态度。如果这一洞他赢了，那么第十八洞他只需要平局就可以胜出了。他心里默默祈祷着，但愿金手指的球无法击打，甚至如果找不到了更好。

霍克已经向前走了过去。他已将手中的袋子放下——他的行动快于邦德的思想——在他们走过来时，他已经忙着去找金手指的球了。

这个任务可不容易——深草区到处是草，又高又密，草根上还带有昨晚的露水。除非他们运气好，否则找到球的希望很小。在寻找了几分钟后，金手指和他的球童已经将搜索范围扩大到了旁边植物丛生的区域。这样挺好，邦德心里想着。然而，突然之间，他的脚踩到了什么东西。真他妈见鬼！他该不该用力踩上一脚让它没进土里呢？他耸了耸肩，弯下腰去，轻轻地将覆盖在球上的尘土和草剥开，不要让自己再隐瞒下去了。没错，是一颗邓禄普65。“球在这儿，”他有点不情愿地喊，“噢，不对，不好意思。您是用的一号球对吗？”

“对，”金手指不耐烦地回答道。

“哦，那就不是了，这是一颗七号球。”邦德捡起球朝金手指走过去。

金手指朝邦德手里的球扫了一眼，说：“不是我的。”接着又用他的球杆头拨拉着草丛找球了。

那是一颗好球，没有做记号，几乎是全新的。邦德将它放进了口袋，又回去接着找了。他看了看手表。依照规则，找球的时间最多为五分钟，马上就到了。再过半分钟，如果还是找不到球，他就赢了。金手指跟他约定了，要严格按照高尔夫的规则比赛。好吧，朋友，等着瞧吧！

金手指又折返回来，朝着邦德的方向，奋力地用球杆对着草丛又戳又搅。

邦德说：“恐怕时间差不多了。”

金手指嘴里咕哝着，他正要说什么，他的球童突然大喊了一声：“在这儿呢，先生，一号邓禄普。”

邦德跟在金手指身后走到球童所站的位置，那是一小块地势较高的平地。球童手指正指着地上的一颗球。邦德弯腰观察了一下，没错，是一颗几乎全新的邓禄普一号，落的位置出奇地好。真是奇迹——甚至比奇迹更不可思议。

邦德严肃地看着金手指和他的球童说：“这也太幸运了。”说完他微微笑了一下。

球童耸了耸肩。金手指的眼神很平静，无忧无虑：“看来的确是幸运。”他朝他的球童转过身去说，“我觉得可以用三号杆来打这个球，福克斯。”

邦德若有所思地走开，然后转过身看着金手指击球，这几乎是金手指今天打得最好的一杆。球飞跃了深草区，直朝果岭而去，可能会落到右侧的沙坑那边。

霍克嘴角耷拉着一根长长的草叶，正站在球道上看着金手指挥杆。邦德走过去，对他苦笑了一下，低声说：“是如我所愿落在沙坑里了，还是落在果岭上了？”

“果岭上，先生。”霍克的话语不带任何感情。

邦德走到自己的球旁边。现在局势又变得紧张了。本来是很有把握取胜的，结果现在可能又是平局了。他朝旗杆望了望，估算了一下距离，这一杆也挺棘手的。他说：“五号杆还是六号杆？”

“六号杆很适合，先生，打得稳稳的。”霍克边说边将六号杆递给邦德。

好，现在清空思维。慢慢打，谨慎一点儿，这一杆不难打，只需要给球足够的动力它就可以跃上果岭了。站好，低头，击球！击球的那一刻力度略有收敛，球按照邦德预期的轨迹飞了出去，不高不低，在果岭的边缘一跃而上，简直完美！不好，见鬼了！球在第二次弹起时碰到了果岭的边缘，停了下来，略微停顿一下后又往回滚了起来，最后从果岭上掉落下来。真是见鬼。这不是正应了哈根那句话：“挥杆好看，推杆值钱。”用推杆打从果岭边缘掉下来的球是高尔夫里最难的打法了。邦德摸出烟，点了一颗，心里开始盘算着下一杆怎么补救——只要金手指那混蛋不能在35英尺以外的距离将球打进洞还是有机会的。

霍克在他身边紧紧跟随，邦德说：“能找到那颗球真是奇迹。”

“那不是他的球，先生。”霍克平静地说。

“你这是什么意思？”邦德的声音显得有点紧张。

“有钱能使鬼推磨，先生。也许只需要五英镑。那球肯定是福克斯从自己裤腿里扔下去的。”

“霍克！”邦德停下脚步，朝四周看了看。金手指和他的球童远在50码以外，正朝着果岭慢慢走过去。邦德厉声说：“你发誓是这样的吗？你怎么这么确定？”

霍克脸上半带羞愧之色，一边嘴角一咧，笑了一下，但他的眼神里又带有那么点儿狡猾和好胜的神色：“因为他的球就压在我的球袋下面，先生。”他看了看邦德嘴巴大大张开的表情，又抱歉地继续说：“对不起，先生。鉴于他先前对您的所作所为，我不得不那么做。本来不想提的，但是我还是想提醒您，他又作弊了。”

邦德禁不住大笑起来，不无崇敬地说：“好吧，你真是太精明啦，霍克。这么说你自己就能帮我赢得这场比赛了！”然后，他又愤愤地说：“苍天有眼，他这是在玩火自焚。我一定要治治他。一定要！好，现在咱们想想该怎么做！”他们慢慢地向前走去。

邦德左手放在他的裤子口袋里，手指无意识地玩弄着那颗他从深草区捡来的球。突然之间，一个想法映入他的脑海。有了！他走到霍克身边，看了看远处那两个人。金手指已经停下了脚步，他背对邦德，正从袋子里拿出一根推杆。邦德用胳膊肘轻轻地推了推霍克：“这个你拿着。”他将球轻轻塞进霍克那粗糙的手中，声音轻柔而急迫地说：“你一定要拿到旗子。当你从果岭上将球捡起的时候，不管这一洞打成什么样，记得把这颗球给金手指，好吗？”

霍克麻木地向前走去，脸上没有任何表情。“知道了，先生。”他用自己正常的语气说，“您能自己拿一下推杆吗？”

“好的。”邦德向自己的球走过去，“给我看看推杆的线路吧，可以吗？”

霍克朝果岭走过去。他在推杆线路的旁边站了一下，然后绕到旗杆后面蹲了下来。他站起来说：“穴边外一英寸，先生，稳定的推杆。给您标记一下吗，先生？”

“不用，就让他在那儿吧。好吧。”

霍克站在一边。此刻，金手指站在果岭右侧他的球旁边。他的球童站在斜坡的下边。邦德弯下腰准备推球。加油，卡拉米迪·简！这一杆一定要打死。邦德稳稳地站住，球杆头沿着线路向后然后向前将球向洞口推去。给它一个机会吧，就是现在！被球杆中部击中的球跃上了洞穴边缘，直奔洞口而去。但是力度过大了，真是见鬼！撞到杆子上了！球顺势转了一个弯，往回跳了三英寸，像一颗门钉一样落在地上不动了。

邦德长叹了一口气，捡起了刚才被他丢在一旁的烟，望了望那边的金手指，心想：好了，你这个混蛋，我又失掉了一局。如果你进了这一洞你可得好好感谢上帝的保佑！但是金手指也没有资本冒险尝试了，他的球在离洞两英尺的地方停下了。

“好吧，好吧，”邦德大度地说，“又是平局，还有最后一洞了。”霍克能够把球捡起来是个关键因素。如果刚才金手指的球进了洞，那就应该由金手指来捡球了。但无论如何，邦德事先也并没有期望金手指这一杆球不进洞，这本不是计划的一部分。

霍克弯腰捡起了球，他将其中一个扔给邦德，另一个递给金手指。他们走下果岭，依然是金手指走在最前面。邦德注意到霍克的手伸进了自己裤子的口袋里。对，就是现在，趁着金手指还没有注意到球座上的任何东西！

现在是平局，还有最后一洞。一般来讲没有人会仔细检查自己的球，这时的动作几乎是无意识的。你所关心的只是如何击球，第二杆怎么打到果岭上或果岭附近，风力如何，怎么拿到你赖以获胜至少是赖以平局的关键的四杆。

出于这种考虑，邦德几乎没有等金手指跟上来就开始击球了，乍看上去，那颗邓禄普七号球跟一号球还真的很像。第十八洞长450码，邦德的第一杆堪称漂亮。如果他愿意的话，他可以一举将球打上果岭，但前提是他真想那么做！

现在轮到金手指击球了，他弯下腰。球就在球桩上，正面朝上，对着金手指。然而金手指又直起身来，向后退了一步，又练习了两次挥杆。之后，他又上前一步，看起来非常谨慎，深思熟虑。他站在球旁，杆头来回晃动着，专注地盯着那颗球。他肯定看见了！他肯定会在最后一分钟停下挥杆弯腰检查那颗球！他就这么一直晃个没完吗？但是，终于，球杆头向后挥去，继而向下挥动，他的左膝朝内弯曲正对地上的那颗球，左臂伸直，像一根笔直的棍子。啪一声！球飞出去了。是一杆漂亮的击球，跟邦德的那杆可以媲美。球直朝球道飞去。

邦德在心里欢呼着：完蛋了，你个混蛋！你完蛋了！邦德满怀喜悦地从球座退下来，大步沿着球道走去，心里盘算着下一步的计划。一切都如他预想的那样残酷而诡异。现在，金手指败局已定——他也是自食其果！现在，他就像一头架在火上的乳猪，就让我们耐心细致地用小火慢慢烘烤吧。

邦德心里丝毫也不感到愧疚，金手指已经玩了他两次了，而且还成功地逃脱了惩罚。这还只是说他在“处女洞”和第十七洞时那两次比较严重的作弊，还不算之前他在第三洞踩平球后面阻碍击球的草丛以及他曾经几次试图干扰邦德击球的事。现在金手指终于要败下阵来了。如果邦德只是用一次作弊来适当地矫正得分，那么这也只能算是一种诗意的公平了。除此之外，这件事的意义远远超出了高尔夫球这么简单。据他对金手指的了解，他必须要赢。如果这次他输了，那么两个人就打成了平手；如果他赢了，那么他就战胜金手指两次了——邦德想，这种情况对于金手指这样一个自视很高的人来讲简直是难以容忍的。金手指一定会想，这个邦德肯定是有两下子，他可以为我所用。这个人敢于冒险，又颇有手段，这就是我需要的那种人。需要他做什么呢？邦德也不知道。也许邦德身上没有什么他需要的本事，也许邦德关于金手指的推断本身就是错误的。但是要想接近这个人，目前为止，这似乎是唯一的方法了。

金手指小心翼翼地拿出他的三号杆，准备打他的第二杆了。这一杆距离很长，需要将球打过沙坑，从狭窄的通道打到果岭上。他比往常多做了一次挥杆练习，然后将球准确无误地打到了果岭前的区域。五杆没有问题，打好的话能有四杆的成绩，这杆打得真不错。

邦德假装一番纠结，然后双手下沉，将手中的三号铁杆压低，以保证球在交叉的沙坑上空飞行的时候不要失控。他的球飞到了果岭上，超过旗杆大约20码的距离。他力道控制得恰到好处——他就是想要这样的效果，他就是要让金手指尝尝胜利在望的滋味，让他迫不及待地想将成绩打成四杆。

而金手指此刻也确实兴奋得微微冒汗了。他弯腰进行一个长距离的推杆想将球打上果岭，继而进洞的时候，脸上露出了一点野蛮的微笑，笑容里满是专注和贪婪。不强也不弱，邦德能够清楚地体会到金手指脑子里每一丝焦虑的想法。金手指又直起身子，大步穿过果岭，走到旗杆后面，来确认他的线路。他走到自己的线路旁边，小心翼翼地用手背打扫着——一两片草叶啊，一小块泥土啊。然后，他又一次弯下腰去，做了一两次挥杆练习，站到击球位置上，太阳穴上青筋突起，双目之间是无比专注的神情。

金手指将球推出，球沿着路线向前。这一杆推得很好，球在超过球洞六英寸后停了下来。现在，对金手指来说几乎可以确信，除非邦德这杆颇有难度的25英尺的球推进洞，否则这一洞就是他胜出了！

邦德大费周章地估算着他的这一杆。他不急不慌，胜负的悬疑在铁青的果岭上像积雨云一样越积越浓。

“请把旗杆拔掉。我这杆一定得打进去。”邦德胸有成竹地说，心里却在盘算着是让球偏左点儿还是偏右点儿，还是让它距离不足呢？

他弯腰击球，结果球向右偏了一点儿，没有进洞。

“见鬼！竟然没进！”邦德故意装出气愤又痛苦的声音说。他走到球洞边，将两颗球都捡了起来。

金手指也走了过来，脸上闪耀着胜利的喜悦之色：“哈哈，真得感谢这场比赛了，看来你完全不是对手啊。”

“要说您的差点是9杆，您还真是打得不错。”邦德酸溜溜地说。他看了看手中的两颗球，将金手指的挑出来递了过去。他假装吃惊的样子。“嘿！”他直直地盯着金手指说，“你是用的邓禄普一号球，对吧？”

“是啊，没错。”金手指仿佛已经捕捉到了厄运到来的迹象，脸上的胜利之色一扫而光，“怎么了？出什么问题了？”

“嗯，”邦德抱歉地说，“恐怕您打错球了。这是我的滕佛尔德爱心，而这颗是邓禄普七号球。”他边说边将手中的两颗球都递到金手指手中。金手指从邦德手中将球抓起，紧张地查看着。

他的脸慢慢地涨得通红。他站在那儿，嘴巴微微张着，目光从那颗球转移到邦德身上，又从邦德身上转移到那颗球上。

邦德温和地说：“太可惜了，咱们事先约定了要严格按照规则打球。也就是说，您这一洞恐怕是得算输了。而且，当然了，整场比赛您也就输了。”邦德面无表情地盯着金手指。

“可是，可是……”

这正是邦德想要的效果——杯与唇的冲撞。他站在那里等着，什么都没说。

突然之间，怒气在金手指那张通常都很放松的脸上像炸弹一样地炸开了。“这是你在深草区找到的那颗邓禄普七号，是你的球童把这颗球给了我，就在第十七洞的果岭上。他是故意的，故意给了我这颗，这他妈的——”

“您先别激动，”邦德温和地说，“您要是不注意就会涉嫌诽谤。霍克，你有没有可能是因为弄错了什么，把这颗球给了金手指先生啊？”

“没有，先生。”霍克的表情显得有点无动于衷，漠然说道，“如果您想听听我的想法，先生，我倒觉得是这位先生在十七洞那里在偏离球的线路很远的地方找到那颗球的时候就弄错了。七号球跟一号球很像，我认为就是这么回事，先生。在我看来，这位先生在那个位置找到简直就是个奇迹。”

“胡说八道！”金手指鼻子厌恶地哼了一声，他生气地转向邦德，“你看见了，我的球童找到的就是一颗一号球。”

邦德摇了摇头，表示怀疑。“我没有仔细看，恐怕是。然而，”邦德的语气变得一本正经起来，语气里还带有一丝轻快，“但是看清楚自己打的是不是自己的球，这应该是一个球手自己的责任，不是吗？我觉得您把一个错误的球摆上了球座打了三杆，这事儿可赖不到别人的头上，”他迈开脚步朝果岭下走去，“很感谢您跟我打今天的比赛，我想咱们改天还得好好比一场。”

西下的阳光照在金手指的身上，留下了金色的光芒，然而也将他身后的影子越拉越长。他跟在邦德身后慢慢走过去，眼睛若有所思地盯着邦德的背影。





第十章　在农庄里


在这个世界上，总有一些有钱人会认为钱对于他们来说，就像球场上的球杆一样。邦德一边享受着沐浴，一边想，金手指就是这么一个人。他觉得他可以用钱摆平一切，用他的大棒摆平一切烦恼和反对意见。他曾经想过用一万美元的赌注吓破邦德的胆——这点钱对他来说是九牛之一毛，而对邦德来说则是一笔不小的财富。在大部分情况下，他可能都能得逞。在长达十八洞的比赛期间，每一杆都值巨额的赌注，在这种情况下，要做到耐心地挥杆，进行每一次短距离的推杆都需要铁的意志。当十八洞全部打平的时候，肩负养家糊口重任的对手可能就会感受到巨大的压力。这就是为什么这些人生活得小心翼翼，从不吸烟，从不酗酒，这也是为什么最后赢得比赛的往往是那个没有这些思想包袱的人。

然而，邦德的情况大不相同。金手指并不知道邦德日常的生活就是这样的一种处于高度压力之下的状态，这种压力和危险反而会使他放松下来。他更不会知道，邦德之所以愿意跟他下这么大的赌注，是因为即使他输了，他背后也会有英国情报局做他经济上的坚强后盾。虽然平时善于操控别人，然而金手指这次却惨遭别人操控了。

或者，自己真的操控了金手指吗？邦德若有所思地从浴缸里爬出来，擦干了身体。在这关键的时刻，那颗又圆又大的脑袋里面的发动机本该是飞速运转的。邦德心里琢磨着，也许自己是被金手指给耍了。自己这张牌打得对不对呢？他这么做会给金手指留下什么样的印象呢？他会认为自己是个有意思、有挑战的人，还是会用他敏锐的嗅觉嗅到一丝威胁呢？如果是后者的话，那么金手指肯定不会上钩了，邦德就只能退出这桩案件的调查，让M另想办法了。他什么时候能够确定这条大鱼到底上钩了没有呢？他上钩之前肯定要仔细嗅嗅鱼饵的。邦德必须要用一个小鱼饵来让金手指感觉自己正在做出一个正确的选择。

突然，他的卧室响起了敲门声。邦德将浴巾裹在身上，走了过去。他打开门，是大厅里的门童。

“什么事？”

“金手指先生给您打来了电话，先生。他对您大加赞扬，并邀请您今晚去他家用晚餐。地址是雷古弗的农庄里，先生。6∶30开始餐前酒，不用穿正装。”

“请向金手指先生转达我的谢意，告诉他我很高兴赴宴。”邦德关上门，走到开着的窗前，看着窗外黄昏时分安静的海面。“说来就来！”邦德不由地笑了笑，“好，就去会会他，看他有什么阴谋诡计。”

六点整，邦德来到楼下的酒吧，要了一大杯伏特加和一份加柠檬片的奎宁水。除了大厦里住着的一群美国空军军官，酒吧里没有什么别的客人了。他们喝着威士忌和冰水，谈着棒球的话题。邦德心想，他们这一天不会都在盘算着在肯特郡上空投掷一颗氢弹吧？没准投掷的具体地点就在今天他和金手指打高尔夫的那几个沙丘上。他对自己苦笑了一下，心想，伙计们，别喝那么多威士忌了。他付了自己的酒钱，离开了。

邦德的车朝雷古弗缓缓驶去，他回味着这个黄昏和腹中的酒精，还有内心悄然出现的疲惫。今晚的饭局注定会很有意思，要趁这个机会好好向金手指推销自己。哪怕走错一步，他就出局了，而且对他的后继者来说，局势也会非常不利。他没带武器——如果金手指察觉到什么蛛丝马迹可就完蛋了。一时之间，他感到了一丝不安，但这种情绪转瞬即逝。两个人之间并没有什么紧张的对峙——反而好像关系很融洽似的。他们在高尔夫俱乐部分别的时候，金手指表现得很是热情，甚至对邦德有点奉承。他询问邦德的通信地址，好给他寄打赌赢得的钱。邦德给他留下了环球出口公司的地址。他还询问邦德下榻的地方。邦德告诉他地址，又特别补充说自己只是在拉姆斯盖特小住几天，等做好未来的规划后就离开了。金手指提到自己也很希望能有机会改天再比一场，然而很不幸，他第二天就要出发去法国了，而且不确定什么时候能回来。

邦德当时特意留意了一下金手指那个司机，那是个身材矮胖、面部扁平的日本人——也许是韩国人的概率更大一些——眼睛歪斜，眼神狂野，像极了日本电影里面的角色，与在这个阳光灿烂的下午坐在肯特郡的那辆劳斯莱斯里的形象非常不协调。他的上唇长得好像猪鼻子一样，似乎是有唇腭裂，但是这个人一直没有说话，所以邦德也无从知道自己的猜测是否正确。他身穿紧身黑色套装，紧得好像要撑裂开来，头上戴着那顶可笑的圆顶礼帽，活像个正在度假的日本摔跤运动员。但是这个角色给人留下的印象可不是引人发笑的。如果你觉得可笑的话，你只需要看一眼那双像舞蹈鞋一样的黑色漆皮皮鞋，和手上那双厚重的黑色皮革驾驶手套，它们散发出来的这种危险而神秘莫测的气息立马就可以使你改变主意了。从这个人的轮廓里似乎能够隐隐约约看到邦德的影子。直到汽车开走，邦德看到了这个人的后脑勺时才想起来，这颗头、这双肩膀，还有这头上的圆顶礼帽自己都曾经见过，正是当天早晨盘踞在赫恩贝那段路上的那辆天蓝色福特汽车的司机。他当时是从哪儿来呢？他是去办什么差事了呢？邦德突然想起了斯密瑟上校说的一些话。这会不会就是那个游走全国为金手指的珠宝连锁店四处收集二手黄金的韩国人呢？那辆行色匆匆的汽车的行李箱里是不是塞满了整整一周以来收集而来的各种手表、图章戒指、项坠和黄金十字架呢？当时，他目送着那辆淡黄色高大的银精灵汽车朝桑德威奇驶去，心里对这个问题给出了肯定的答案。

邦德从主路上拐了下来，沿着一条两旁长着高高的维多利亚时代冬青的车道继续行驶，一直开到了一座可以被称为农庄的房子前面，在一片铺满沙砾的空地上停了车。那是一座厚重丑陋的房子，看样子应该是建造于本世纪初，门廊两边镶有玻璃。邦德甚至都还没关掉发动机，脑子里就浮现出了屋子里一股不太清新的阳光、橡胶树和死苍蝇的味道。邦德慢慢走下汽车，站在门外看着这座房子。它那空洞的、擦洗的很干净的窗户好像两只眼睛也在盯着邦德。房子里似乎有一种隐隐约约的声音，好像一只血脉贲张的巨兽发出的沉重而又有节奏感的喘息声。右边高高的针叶树丛中直直地伸出一根烟囱，好像一根高高竖起的手指正在警告着什么，邦德觉得这声音应该是从这个烟囱所在的工厂里的马厩或车库里发出来的。这座房子外表平静，好像在等待着邦德采取什么行动，一旦邦德有什么冒犯性的活动，它马上就会有所回应。邦德耸了耸肩，尽量减轻了一点自己心理上的压力，拾阶而上，走到那镶着不透明玻璃的大门前，按响了门铃。虽然没有听到门铃响起的声音，但是门缓缓打开了。那个韩国司机头上还戴着那顶圆顶礼帽，漠然地看着邦德。他站在原地没动，左手扶在门内侧的门把手上，右手伸出，像路标一样指着黑乎乎的大厅方向。

邦德努力压抑着想在他干净的黑皮鞋上踩上一脚或在他黑色套装扣子紧扣的肚子上打上一拳的冲动，从他身边走了过去。这个韩国人的形象跟他一贯对韩国人的印象非常一致。不仅是他，还有这房子里那种沉重紧张的气氛都让邦德感到很不舒服，很想用暴力来进行宣泄。

房子里阴暗的大厅同时也承担了客厅的功能。微弱的火苗在宽大的壁炉里摇曳着，对面是两只扶手椅和一个诺尔沙发。它们之间的低沙发上，放着一个装满饮食的茶盘。房间四周摆满了第二帝国时期的罗斯柴尔德式的高大家具、铜锡器、玳瑁、铜以及珍珠母，这些东西在微弱的火光照射下闪耀着点点光芒。在这摆放有序的丰富藏品后面，黑色的镶板以上就是二楼的画廊了，可以沿着大厅左边一架严重弯曲的楼梯走上去。大厅的屋顶上装饰着一些那个时代的木雕，颜色昏暗。

邦德正站在大厅里环顾四周，那个韩国人无声无息地走了过来。他又一次将他那路标一样的胳膊举了起来，指向椅子那边的茶盘。邦德点了点头，没动地方。韩国人从邦德身边走过，消失在了一扇门后，邦德觉得那儿肯定是个仆人休息室之类的地方。一座装饰得颇为庄重的老钟发出滴答滴答的声音，这反而使房间里显得更为安静了，这种静滞的气氛不断地积聚，悄悄地向邦德逼来。

邦德走到壁炉边，背对壁炉站着。他谨慎地盯着这个房间。真是该死！环境多么糟糕又死气沉沉的住所啊！旁边100码以外就是明亮的光线、新鲜的空气和宽阔的视野，一个人怎么会、怎么能住在这由针叶树和冬青环绕的太平间一样的房子里呢？邦德拿出一支烟，点上了。

金手指怎么享受舒适、乐趣甚至是性爱呢？可能他根本不需要这些东西吧，或许对黄金的追求使他所有的欲望都已经满足了。

突然，某个地方的电话铃声响了起来。尖锐的铃声响了两下就停下了。之后听到了某个声音小声嘟囔着，然后走廊里回响起了脚步声，楼梯尽头的一扇门打开了。金手指从门里出来，轻声将身后的门关好。他身穿一件紫红色的天鹅绒晚宴服，慢慢走过打磨得很亮的地板。他没有向邦德伸手握手的打算。嘴角带着一丝微笑，他说：“收到这么简短的通知您就来了，您真是个好人，邦德先生。您是一个人，我也是一个人，所以我就想，我们一起谈谈玉米的价格也好。”

这是富人之间常用的话题。自己临时享受了富人的待遇，邦德感到很有意思。他说：“收到您的邀请我很高兴。整天沉浸在自己的问题里我也是有点厌倦了，来到拉姆斯盖特也没有什么好转。”

“的确，我想向您道个歉。我刚刚接了一个电话，我的一个员工——对了，我雇了几个韩国人——其中一个跟马盖特警方出现了一点小摩擦，我必须要过去处理一下。我想就是在找乐子的时候出了点小事儿。这些人很容易就会太过兴奋。我的司机带我去，我们有半小时就回来了。这段时间内，恐怕您得自己待一会儿了。请您先随意喝点儿什么。那边有杂志，您可以看。您能原谅我吗？我保证半小时就回来。”

“没关系。”邦德感到这事非常可疑。他搞不清楚金手指究竟在耍什么把戏。

“那么好，再会。”金手指走到前门口，“但是我还是给您开开灯吧。这房子里真的是有点太暗了。”金手指轻轻触摸了一下墙上的一个开关，大厅里所有的灯都瞬间亮了起来——顶灯、壁灯，还有屋顶上的四个射灯。房间的亮度一下变得跟摄影棚不相上下了。光线这样突然的变化让邦德觉得有点头晕目眩。他看着金手指打开门大步走了出去，大约一分钟后，他听到了汽车发动的声音，但是听着不像是那辆劳斯莱斯，发动机加速运转，换档，然后沿着车道快速行驶出去了。

出于本能，邦德走到门口，将门打开了。车道上已经什么都看不见了。在远远的地方，他看到车灯向左转上了主路，朝马尔盖特的方向飞驰而去。他又回到屋子里，关好了门。他静静地站在那儿，聆听着。屋子里除了那钟表发出的沉重的嘀嗒声，完全没有一丝的声音。他走到那个仆人休息处的门口打开一看，一条狭长而昏暗的走廊一直通向房子的后面。邦德弯下身子，他的每一根神经都紧绷起来。寂静，死一般的寂静。邦德关上门，若有所思地环顾了一下灯火通明的大厅。金手指让他一个人留在自己的房子里。为什么？他不怕自己的秘密暴露吗？

邦德走到茶盘边，倒了一杯杜松子酒和奎宁水。没错，金手指刚才确实是接了一个电话，不过也很可能是他事先安排他的人从工厂打来的电话。仆人的故事编得有眉有眼，金手指要带上他的司机亲自去把那人保释出来也是合情合理的。金手指两次提到邦德有半个小时的时间独自待在这里，在这段时间他可以“随意”。他说这话也可能没什么深意，但也很有可能是在诱使邦德现出原形，做出些不慎重的举动。这里有人在监视他吗？金手指手下一共有几个韩国人，他们都在做什么？邦德看了看手表，已经过去五分钟了。他打定了主意，不管这是不是圈套，这个机会都不容错过。他要在这里快速地转上一圈——但是当然，他得事先编好一个好的借口，解释他为什么离开大厅。从哪儿开始呢？要去工厂看看。怎么说呢？就说来时路上车出了问题——比如汽油管堵了之类的——他想到那儿看看能不能找个机械师帮他看看。这借口编得不怎么可信，但也凑合得过去。邦德喝下杯中的酒，果断地走到仆人休息处的门口走了进去。

门口有个开关，邦德按了一下，走廊里的灯亮了。他沿着走廊轻快地走了过去。走廊尽头是一面白墙，左右分别有一扇门。他听了听左边，隐隐约约好像是厨房做饭的声音。他伸手打开了右边的门，呈现在眼前的是一片停车场，正如他先前预期的一样。唯一奇怪的是，整个停车场都被一些弧光灯照亮了。停车场的那头就是工厂长长的围墙，墙里的机器那有节奏的重击声在这里听起来格外吵闹。邦德发现那道墙上有一扇简朴的木门，他一边向门走过去，一边悠闲地向四周观望着。

门没有锁，他小心地推开门，走了进去，将身后的门保持半开的状态。他发现自己走进了一间空空荡荡的小办公室，屋顶上一只裸露的灯泡发出微弱的光芒。一张办公桌上零散地放着一些纸张，除此之外屋里的摆设还有一个时钟、两个文件柜，还有一部电话。办公室里另有一扇门通向工厂内部，门边还有一扇窗户，可以供办公室里的人们监视工人干活之用。这里肯定是工头的办公室了。邦德走到窗前，向外望去。

邦德也不知道自己期望在这里找到什么，不过这里看起来跟普通的小型金属制造工厂没有什么区别。他正对面是两座鼓风炉的炉口，里面的火苗奄奄一息。紧邻的是一排用于融化金属的熔炉，旁边堆放着大大小小各种颜色的金属。一台闪闪发亮的钢质桌子上放着的看来像是一些圆形的锯子、菱形的锯子之类的，用以切割钢铁。桌子左侧的阴影里，一台柴油发电机正在运转。右边，在弧光灯下，一共有五个人——其中四个是韩国人——正在金手指那辆劳斯莱斯旁边忙活着。车身在灯光下闪闪发光，只是右门已经从车身上拆了下来，除此以外，整个车身几乎完美无瑕。拆下来的门板就放在不远处的两个长凳上。邦德看到的场景，正是其中的两个人将一块新的门板抬起——一块变色的、像铝制品一样颜色的金属——并安装到门框上面去。地板上放着两把手动铆钉机，很快邦德就想到了，这些人肯定是要把门装上去，然后再漆成和车身其他部分一致的颜色。没有发现任何异常。金手指那天下午确实将右边的车门撞出了一个凹痕，这些人加紧为他修理为明天的旅行做准备，这也很正常。邦德愠怒地快速环顾了一下四周，将目光从窗口收回，从工厂的门口退了出来，把门轻轻地从身后带上了。什么都没有，真是见鬼了。那么现在他的借口要怎么编呢？就说不想打扰那些人的工作——如果饭后他们有空的话再说吧。

邦德不紧不慢地顺着原路返回大厅，还好没人发现。他看了看手表。还有十分钟，现在可以去看看二楼。一所房子的秘密多半藏在卧室和浴室里，因为这些都属于私密空间，药柜、梳妆台、床头柜这些地方都可能藏着一个人私密的东西。邦德想的借口是自己突然头疼得厉害，因此想上去找片阿司匹林吃。他好像是表演给一个看不见的观众看，用手揉了揉自己的太阳穴，抬头朝楼梯看了看，然后决然地穿过了大厅，走上了楼梯。楼梯的尽头是一个灯火通明的走廊，邦德穿过走廊，将门一扇扇打开朝里望去。但是这些好像都是备用的卧室，床上都没有铺好床单。屋里有一股因为长期关闭窗户而产生的霉臭的气味。一只姜黄色的猫不知道从哪儿冒了出来，跟在邦德身后，喵喵叫着在他裤腿上蹭来蹭去。最后一个房间肯定是了，邦德走了进去，将门关得只剩一条小缝。

房间里所有的灯都开着，可能有个仆人在浴室里吧。邦德大着胆子走到一扇门边，将门推开了。里面的灯也亮着，但是没有人。那是一间很大的浴室，也许是由一间卧室改造而成的。除了浴缸和洗手盆之外，里面还有很多的健身器械——有划船器、单车、体操棍棒，还有一条拉力保健带。药柜里除了很多的泻药以外什么都没有——番泻实、鼠李、卡萨拉蒂、内皮型一氧化氮合酶，还有其他一些器械，也都是一样通便的功效。没有别的药，也没有阿司匹林。邦德又回到了卧室，然而也是一无所获。这是一间典型的男人住的房间，看起来很舒适，有不少的衣橱。房间里弥漫着一种中性的气味。床边有一个小书架，上面放着一些历史和传记类的书，都是英语的。床头柜的抽屉没有关严，一本黄色的书的背脊露了出来——《爱的窥探》，巴黎帕拉迪木出版社出版。

邦德看了看手表。还有五分钟。该下楼了。他又最后环顾了一下四周，朝门口走去。突然他又停下了脚步。自从进入这个房间他就注意到了什么，几乎是下意识地，是什么呢？他努力感觉着。这个房间里有种什么东西让人感觉跟环境不大协调。是什么呢？是某种颜色？还是某个物体？还是某种气味？还是某种声音呢？对了！从他站着的地方，他能听到一种很微弱的像蚊子哼哼一样的声音。这声音频率高的时候几乎超出了人的听力范围。这声音是从哪儿发出来的？是什么东西发出来的？这间房间里肯定有什么东西，邦德太熟悉这个东西了，是个很危险的东西。

邦德紧张地走到门边的衣橱前，轻轻地打开了门。没错，就是从这里发出的声音。衣橱里挂着很多运动服，一直垂到下面三层抽屉的上沿。那声音就是从这些衣服后面传出来的。邦德动作麻利地将这些衣服拨到一边衣服后面的东西把他惊呆了。

在接近衣橱顶部的三个沟槽里，三条六毫米宽的录像带正缓缓下降到那三个假抽屉后面一个深深的箱子里。箱子里已经积攒了有半箱这种像蛇一样滑溜溜的录像带。邦德的神经绷得紧紧的，眼睛死死地盯着这该死的证据在这箱子里越卷越多。这就是了，胶片，摄像头，三个，天知道这三个摄像头隐藏在哪里——大厅、后院的停车场，还有这个房间——它们在金手指离开的这段时间里一直在监视着邦德的一举一动。还有，那让人头晕目眩的灯光。这就是金手指离开的时候要把灯打开的原因了。邦德当时为什么没有想到呢？为什么他连看透、起码是察觉这个圈套的最基本的想象力都没有呢？还想什么借口。他花了半个小时的时间四处窥探，费尽力气却什么都没有找到，这些狗屁借口还有什么用？还有一点，他竟然什么都没有发现——没有窥探到任何秘密。他完全是在浪费时间，像个傻子一样，而现在还将把柄落到了金手指手中。现在他真的完蛋了，功亏一篑。还能采取点什么行动挽回一下残局吗？邦德定定地站在那里，看着那缓缓滚动的胶片。

再想想看！邦德的大脑飞速运转着，思考着有什么方法或借口能帮他摆脱困境，不断地假设，又不断地否定。嗯，至少通过打开衣橱门，他将这些胶片的一部分曝光了。那么为什么不把它们全部曝光呢？为什么不呢？但是怎么做到呢？如果说衣橱门不是他打开的，那又能是谁呢？这时，从卧室门的门缝里传来了一声“喵”的猫叫声。对了，那只猫！为什么不能是那只猫干的呢？有点牵强，但是至少也有那么点儿意思。邦德打开门。把猫抱了起来。猛地把它塞到衣橱里。猫发出了咕噜咕噜的声音。邦德将装胶片的箱子拽倾斜，并且用手抓了抓，确保所有胶片都暴露在了强光之下。在确信所有胶片都被毁掉之后，他又将手中的胶片扔回到箱子里，将那只猫扔了进去。估计它一时半刻很难出去。运气好的话它还有可能放弃挣扎在箱子里睡上一觉。邦德故意将衣橱门留了一个宽约三英寸的缝隙，确保接下来录好的胶片同样遭到曝光。他将卧室门也留了那么一条缝隙，然后飞速地沿着走廊跑了出来。到达楼梯的时候，他放慢了速度，悠闲地慢步下楼。见证他那戏剧般表演的只有那空无一人的大厅。他走到壁炉前，在杯子里又倒了一点儿酒，拿起了一本《田野》杂志，翻到伯纳德·达尔文的高尔夫评论，看了几眼了解了一下大意，然后在其中一把扶手椅上坐了下来，点燃了一根烟。

他发现了什么？今天这事有什么积极的方面吗？有价值的信息很少，只知道金手指饱受便秘折磨，并且这个人思想肮脏，想对邦德进行一次基本测验。毫无疑问他做得很专业。生手可做不到这样。

这技术完全符合“间谍之死”的标准，能使用这种技术的人肯定也是有不少的秘密需要隐藏。那么待会儿会发生什么情况呢？如果猫弄乱了录像带的说法成立，金手指必须保证那两扇门不能关严——其中一扇还相当的重要——这样那只猫才有机会受到录像机声音的诱惑。这种概率很小，非常不可思议。金手指会认为这事儿有九成的概率是邦德干的，但是也仅仅是九成而已，剩下的一成他也无法确认。通过这件事金手指对邦德的了解会比以前更多吗？他会不会认为邦德是个狡猾而诡计多端的人？或者他会不会认为邦德好奇心很重，没准儿是个小偷呢？他可能会猜测邦德去过了卧室，但是邦德其他的行为——不管有没有价值——都会随着胶片的曝光成为永久的秘密了。

邦德站起来，又拿了几本杂志，扔到自己坐的那张椅子旁边。现在他唯一要做的就是厚着脸皮为自己辩护，为将来做好打算——如果还有将来的话——他必须要唤醒自己的警惕性，不能再犯任何错误了。如果再有这样的紧要关头，世界上可没有那么多的黄猫帮他蒙混过关了。

没有听到车道上有汽车开来的声音，门口也没有声音，但是邦德的后颈感觉到了夜晚的凉风，他知道，金手指回来了。





第十一章　名叫“得力”的男人


邦德将手中的《田野》扔到一边，站起身来。前门那边传来了很大的关门声。邦德转过身，说：“你好。”脸上带着礼貌而惊讶的表情，“没听到您进来的声音。事儿办得怎么样了？”

金手指的表情也很和蔼，好像他们是老朋友、老邻居，彼此习惯了到对方家里随便坐坐，喝上一杯似的。“事情自己就解决了。我的伙计跟酒馆儿里的几个美国空军吵起来了，因为他们叫他该死的日本佬。我跟警察解释了，韩国人特别讨厌别人管他们叫日本佬。他们警告了一下就把人放了。让您等了这么长时间真是太抱歉了。希望您在这儿没有觉得太无聊吧，再来一杯吧。”

“谢谢，但是我感觉您离开了也就是五分钟不到呢。我一直在看这篇达尔文写的关于十四号杆的使用规则呢，他的观点还挺有趣。”邦德回忆了一下这篇文章的一些细节，关于这个规则补充了一点自己的评论。

金手指一直耐心地站在那里听他说完，说：“是，这是一项很复杂的运动。当然了，您打球的方式跟我不一样，您的技术比我纯熟多了。如果是我的挥杆方式，我在比赛中得用到允许使用的所有球杆。好吧，我上楼去洗洗，然后我们开始用餐，稍等片刻。”

邦德又给自己倒了一杯酒，故意发出很大的声音，然后，坐了下来，拿起了一本《乡村生活》。他用眼睛的余光看着金手指爬上了楼梯，消失在走廊尽头。他在脑子里想象着金手指走出的每一步。突然，他发现自己手中的杂志都拿倒了。他赶紧将杂志倒转过来，茫然地盯着上面一张精美的布伦海姆宫的图片。

楼上是死一般的寂静。然后远远地传来冲马桶的声音，然后是关门声。邦德伸手拿起他的酒杯，喝了一大口，又将杯子放在了他的椅子旁边。金手指正向楼下走来。邦德将手中的《乡村生活》翻了一页，把手中香烟的烟灰在烟灰缸里弹了弹。

现在，金手指正穿过大厅向他走来。邦德放下手中的杂志，抬起头来。金手指漫不经心地将那只黄猫夹在一只胳膊下。他走到壁炉前，弯腰按了一下铃。

然后，他转身面对邦德，说：“您喜欢猫吗？”他的眼神平淡，好像对答案漠不关心似的。

“相当喜欢。”

供仆人出入的那扇门打开了。那位司机站在了门口。他还戴着那顶圆顶礼帽和那双闪亮的黑色手套。他面无表情地看着金手指。金手指向他弯了弯手指。司机走了过来，站在壁炉前面。

金手指转身对邦德说：“这是我的得力助手。”他微微一笑，“这是个玩笑式的说法。‘得力’，给邦德先生看看你的手。”他又对邦德笑了笑说：“我管他叫‘得力’，因为这名字正好解释了他对我的功能。”

那个韩国人慢慢摘下手套，走过来站在离邦德一臂远的地方，将他的手掌朝上伸了出来。邦德站起来看了看。那双手又大又肥，满是肌肉。十个手指长度好像一样。指尖非常粗大并且很有光泽，仿佛它们是用黄色的骨头雕刻而成的。

手指上竟然没有指甲。本该长指甲的地方跟手指内侧一样，也是那种微微发黄的硬壳。他又把手翻转成侧面朝上，手指的各个侧面竟然都是那种质地很像骨头的物质。

邦德朝金手指扬起了眉毛。

金手指说：“我们会示范给您看的。”他指了指楼梯上那粗壮的橡木扶手。那扶手大约有六英寸粗。那个韩国人顺从地走到楼梯边，往上走了几级台阶。他站在那里，双手垂在身体两侧，像一条训练有素的猎狗一样望着金手指。金手指轻轻点了一下头。韩国人面无表情地将右手高高举过头顶，然后将手像斧头一样地朝那粗壮的扶手劈了下去。随着一声木头碎裂的声音，扶手从中间断裂开来，垂了下去。随后，这只手又像闪电一样的举起落下，这次它从扶手的中间横扫而过，留下一条锯齿状的裂痕。木头碎屑噼里啪啦地掉落在大厅地板上。韩国人站直身体，等待着进一步的命令。他的脸色没有因为用力而有变红的迹象，在完成这样破坏性的动作之后，他也丝毫没有显示出任何骄傲的神色。

金手指又一次招手示意，于是韩国人又回到了他的身边。金手指说：“他的双脚也是这样，外沿坚硬无比。‘得力’，壁炉台。”金手指指了指壁炉上方一个厚重的木雕架子。它的高度大约是七英尺——比那个韩国人的圆顶礼帽上沿还高出六英寸。

“宅着帽纸？”

“对了，脱了外套，摘了帽子。”金手指转身面对邦德说，“可怜的家伙，他有唇腭裂，我想除了我以外没有多少人能听懂他说什么。”

邦德心想，这人还真是实用呢，一个只有通过他的翻译才能跟别人交流的奴隶——甚至比聋哑的伊斯兰女人更加可靠，跟他的主人关系更为紧密，更加安全。

“得力”脱下外套，摘下帽子，将它们整齐地放在地上。他又弯腰将裤腿卷至及膝，后退一步以专业柔道运动员的站姿站好。看那架势好像一头强壮的大象都不足以将他推倒。

“您最好后退一步，邦德先生。”金手指大嘴里的牙齿反射着微光，“这一招要折断人的脖子跟折一根草一样轻而易举。”金手指边说边退到了放着茶盘的那个长沙发旁边。现在，那个韩国人开始助跑了。不过他离目标也就只有三步的距离。他怎么可能够得着那么高的壁炉台呢？

邦德饶有兴致地看着。此时此刻，那张黄色扁平的脸上镶嵌着的那双歪斜的眼睛里暴露出了凶残的光芒。邦德心想，面对这样一个对手，一般人估计只有跪在地上等死的份儿了。

金手指抬起了手。那双锃亮的软皮鞋里包裹的脚趾紧紧地抓着地。那个韩国人双膝弯曲，迈出了一大步，然后一个回旋跳，身体离开了地面。在半空中，他的双脚像芭蕾舞演员那样合在一起，但是那高度绝对是芭蕾舞演员遥不可及的。紧接着，他的身体侧弯、向下，右脚像活塞一样飞了出去。只听“砰”的一声。他的身体优雅地下落，双手支撑地板，双肘弯曲撑住体重，然后双臂又迅速直起，使他得以顺势站起身来。

“得力”又站直身体。这次，当他看到壁炉上由他的脚留下的深达三英寸的裂痕时，他那漠然的眼睛里也显现出了些许骄傲的神色。

邦德用敬畏的眼神看着他。两天前的那个晚上，他还在研究那本徒手搏斗的小册子，书里内容和现实经历，从来没有哪个能够跟他刚刚看到的招式相提并论的。那人简直不是血肉之躯。他简直就是一根有生命的棍棒，有可能是地球上最危险的动物。邦德不得不向这个丑陋而可怕的人表达他的敬佩之情，他别无选择，他向韩国人伸出了手。

“轻点，‘得力’。”金手指的嗓音像鞭子抽打发出的声音一样。

那个韩国人低下头，握住了邦德的手。他的手指没有弯曲，只是轻轻弯曲了大拇指扣住邦德的手。邦德感觉自己像是握住了一块木板一样。稍稍握了一下，他就将邦德的手松开，去拿自己放在地上的衣服了。

“请原谅，邦德先生，我非常欣赏您的举动，”金手指脸上露出了赞赏的神色，“但是‘得力’不知道他自己力气很大——尤其是当他兴奋的时候。而且，他的手就像钢铁机器一样力道强劲，有可能他自己都还没有意识到就已经将您的手捏成碎屑了。好了，现在，”“得力”已经穿戴整齐，恭敬地站在一旁，“表现得很好，‘得力’，看来你一直在坚持训练。做得很好。给——”金手指将胳膊下夹着的猫扔给韩国人，他马上接了过去，眼里满是欲望，“我不想再看到它了，你拿去当晚餐吧。”韩国人的眼睛里马上放出了贪婪的光芒。“告诉厨房，马上给我们开饭。”

韩国人快速地点了一下头，转身离开了。

邦德努力地掩藏着自己内心的厌恶之情，他知道这些都是表演给他看的，这是对他的一种警告，一种示威。金手指好像在对他说：“看见我的能耐了吧，邦德先生？我要想杀死你就像弄死一只蚂蚁一样容易。‘得力’展示了他的能力，如果你敢碍事儿，我是不会说什么，‘得力’可能就要代我小小地惩罚一下了。今天，这只猫就是代你受罚，算它倒霉了。”

邦德故作轻松地说：“他为什么总戴着那顶礼帽？”

“‘得力’！”韩国人已经走到了仆人通道的门边。“帽子。”金手指指了指壁炉附近的一张木板。

“得力”左胳膊夹着那只猫，转过身来，麻木地朝他们走过来。走到大厅中间时，他既没有停下脚步也没有刻意瞄准，抓住帽檐全力地将帽子扔了出去。随着很响亮的“咣”的一声，礼帽在金手指指示的那张木板上砸进去了一个一英寸深的沟槽，随后“咔嗒”一声掉落在地板上。

金手指礼貌地朝邦德笑了笑：“这是一种又轻又结实的合金，邦德先生。刚才这一下恐怕把这帽子的毛毡面磕坏了，但是不用担心，‘得力’会换上一个新的。他还很擅长针线呢。您应该也看得出来，这一下的力道完全可以打碎一个人的头颅，或者折断他的脖子。这件武器使用趁手，掩藏得又很巧妙。我想您肯定也是这么想的吧。”

“是，确实如此。”邦德也礼貌地笑了笑，“适合常伴左右的得力助手。”

“得力”捡起帽子离开了。只听见一声锣响。“啊！晚餐好了，我们进去吧！”金手指引领邦德走到隐藏在壁炉旁边的一扇门边，在一个隐藏着的弹簧锁上按了一下，走了进去。

这间小小的餐厅跟大厅的豪华很是相配，餐厅中央的枝形吊灯和餐桌四周的蜡烛使整个餐厅都显得十分明亮，餐桌上面的银器和杯子也都在灯光照射下闪耀着柔和的光芒。

他们面对面坐了下来。两名身穿白色制服的黄皮肤的仆人从一辆装满食物的送餐车上将食物搬下，摆上餐桌。第一道菜是咖喱肉块米饭。金手指看到邦德犹豫了一下，轻轻干笑了两声说：“没关系的，邦德先生，里面是虾肉，不是猫肉。”

“啊！”邦德的态度显得有点模棱两可。

“请您尝尝产自摩泽尔的这瓶酒。希望合您的口味。53年的比斯波特·黄金水滴雷司令。您自己倒吧。如果让他们倒酒，酒会倒在杯子里还是盘子里可就不一定了。”

邦德面前的冰桶里有一个细长的酒瓶。他拿起来倒了一点儿尝了尝，味道甘美，口感冰爽。邦德向金手指赞美了这美酒，他只是草草点了一下头。

“我既不吸烟也不喝酒，邦德先生。拿吸烟来讲，我觉得这是人类所有行为当中最为可笑的一种了，而且也是完全违背自然的，您能想象吗？如果一头牛或其他什么动物一边嚼着干草，一边吸进烟雾，又从鼻孔里喷出来。呸！那算什么德行！”金手指的语气中终于带出了一点感情，“这是多么令人讨厌的行为。至于喝酒嘛，我也算是个药剂师。我发现很难找到一种不含任何毒素的酒，有些毒还是致命的。比如杂醇油、乙酸、乙基醋酸盐、乙醛，还有糠醛。对这些毒素一定量的摄入有可能导致死亡。酒中所含的微量的这些物质会导致各种各样的病理作用，而酒瓶上的警告只会将之描述为‘宿醉’。”

金手指将正将一叉咖喱虾肉即将送到嘴边的手停在半空，继续说：“既然您喝酒，邦德先生，我对您有个很好的建议。千万别喝那种拿破仑白兰地，尤其是那种号称是‘陈年木桶装’的。那种酒是我研究过的所有酒里含我提到的那些毒素最多的，陈年波旁威士忌其次。”金手指将那叉虾肉塞到口中，终于停止了他对酒的批判。

“非常感谢。我会记住的。可能就是由于这样的原因吧，我最近改喝伏特加了。据说它经过活性炭过滤过了，可能会好点。”邦德模模糊糊记得从哪儿看到过有的专家提出过这样的说法，现在生拉硬扯了出来。能够对答得上金手指的话题，他心里还有点沾沾自喜了。

金手指凌厉地看了他一眼，说：“您好像也懂得点儿似的，您学过化学？”

“浅尝辄止。”邦德感觉将话题进一步深入的机会到了，“您的司机给我的印象真是深刻啊！他是从哪儿学来的那么厉害的搏斗招数呢？这些招数是什么渊源？这是韩国功夫吗？”

金手指用餐巾擦了擦嘴。他打了一下响指。那两名仆人将盘子撤下，又上了一道烤鸭，并给邦德上了一瓶木桐红酒1947。等两人分别退到送餐桌的两端站定之后，金手指开口说：“您听说过空手道吗？没有？我的司机就是世界上获得空手道黑带的三个人之一。空手道是柔道的一个分支，它跟柔道之间的关系类似斯潘道军火库(1)跟一个小弹弓之间的关系。”

“我明白了。”

“今天给您展示的只是一些雕虫小技，邦德先生。”金手指将手中的鸭腿举了起来，“我敢说如果‘得力’将任何一个招式用在您身体七个要害中的任何一个上，您早就没命了。”金手指津津有味地在鸭腿上咬了一口。

邦德严肃地说：“有意思，我只知道有五个招式能够让‘得力’一招毙命。”

金手指好像没有听见邦德的话，他放下鸭腿，喝了一大杯水。然后，他靠在椅背上，趁邦德享受美食的时候又继续说下去。

“邦德先生，空手道是基于以下理论的，它认为人的身体上有五个攻击层面，37个攻击点。所谓攻击点，是相对于空手道高手来说的。那些人的指尖、手背和脚都像谷子一样覆盖了一层硬壳。这种硬壳远比骨头更坚硬，然而却更加灵活。邦德先生，‘得力’每天都会用一小时的时间来击打装着锋利的冰块的冰袋和用粗麻绳缠了很多圈的邮筒。然后再用一小时来进行体能训练，那种训练跟普通健身房的不一样，更像芭蕾舞演员的训练。”

“那他什么时候练习扔帽子？”这种心理战好像对邦德丝毫不起作用似的。

金手指皱了皱眉，说：“我没问过。”语气冷冷的，一点开玩笑的意思都没有，“不过我想您也看得出来，‘得力’对他所有技能的训练都毫不松懈。对了，您问到空手道是源自什么地方，它起源于中国。在那里，游僧们很容易成为拦路强盗们的猎物，他们的宗教信仰不允许他们携带武器，于是他们发明了这种徒手的格斗。后来经过一些日本冲绳人的改进成了现在这个样子。他们提出了人体的五个攻击层面——拳、掌侧面、指尖、脚掌和肘——他们通过练习让这几个部位外面包裹上一层硬壳。空手道的招式没有后续姿势，在攻击的时刻，整个身体都会紧绷，重心放在臀部，然后身体迅速放松，这样永远不会失去平衡。‘得力’的攻击能力简直让人惊叹，有一次我看见他发出全力打倒了一面砖墙，手却一点儿都没有受伤。三层半英寸厚的木板叠在一起之后他徒手就能够劈开，而且他的脚部力量您也见证过了。”

邦德喝了一大口美味的红酒：“您的家具可真倒霉。”

金手指耸了耸肩：“这房子反正对我来说也没什么用了，我只是希望这样的表演能让您高兴高兴，您也同意那只猫是‘得力’应得的奖励吧？”金手指一边说一边向桌子对面投来了犀利的目光。

“他也练过杀猫吗？”

“他觉得猫肉是美味佳肴。在他小时候，家乡闹了一场饥荒，那会儿他就养成了吃猫肉的习惯。”

邦德觉得可以趁机深入打探一下更多的消息：“您为什么要养这么个人呢？我觉得他跟您算不上是志趣相投吧。”

“邦德先生，”金手指一边打了个响指招呼那两个仆人，一边说，“不管怎么说，我是个有钱人，相当有钱，一个人越是有钱他就越是需要保护。普通的保镖或侦探什么的通常就是个退休的警察，没什么用。他们反应迟钝，方法老套，还容易收受贿赂，而且还不愿意杀生害命。这对我保住自己的性命来说没什么好处。这些韩国人完全没有这样的想法，这就是日本人在战争期间雇用他们做监狱守卫的原因。他们是这个世界上最冷酷、最无情的人了。我的人都是经过精心挑选的，都具备这样的素质。他们都做得很好，我很满意。他们也很满意，他们工资很高，吃得好，住得也好。如果他们想要女人，我们就从伦敦给他们找应召女郎，钱我来出。这些女人长得不怎么样，但是他们不在乎，只要是白人就行。这是他们唯一的追求，就是要让白种人忍受这样的羞辱。有时候也会出点儿乱子，但是，”他的目光变得有点暗淡无神，低头看着桌面，“有钱能使鬼推磨。”

邦德微微笑了一下：“您也喜欢这句老话吗？这是我的格言。”

一道美味的乳酪蛋奶酥上桌了，之后咖啡也端上来了。他们不再说话，安安静静地享用着，看起来两个人都是舒适又放松的样子。邦德确实是这样，而金手指则做作地让他的头发披散下来——虽然只披到肩膀上，但是他正在向邦德展示他私密的一面，他认为这一面可能比较容易引起邦德的共鸣——残酷、冷血的大亨形象。没准儿，邦德在他房子里的探查——金手指至少是对此有所怀疑——恰恰揭示了邦德身上具备一种他很乐于见到的特质——不正直，至少他实际上没有他表面上那么“绅士”。金手指倒是可以利用这点将邦德为己所用，只要再做点进一步的调查，就可以进行任命了。

邦德靠在椅背上，点了支烟，说：“您那辆车不错啊。肯定是绝版的吧。大约产自1925年，对吗？三缸，每缸有两个火花塞。”

“您说的没错，但是除此之外，我还做了些改装。我又增加了五根减震簧，为增加刹车力度给后轮定做安装了刹车片，前轮的塞尔沃刹车远远不够。”

“哦，这有必要吗？您那车的最高时速不会超过50英里，人的重量又没有多大。”

金手指扬起了眉毛：“您不信吗？如果装上一吨重的装甲板和防弹玻璃就不是那么回事了。”

邦德微笑着说：“哦，我明白了。您对自己的安全还真是上心。但是您乘飞机旅行的时候怎么带上这辆车呢？您难道不带它上飞机吗？”

“我自己有专机，银城公司很了解我这辆车，我每年定期出行两次。”

“就是在欧洲四处转转吗？”

“就是去打高尔夫。”

“有意思，我也很羡慕这样的生活。”

金手指没有上钩：“您现在也过得起这样的生活了。”

邦德笑了笑，说：“哦，您是说那一万美元吧？但是如果我决定要移居加拿大的话，还得拿它作安家之用呢。”

“您觉得您去那儿能赚大钱吗？您想不想赚很多的钱？”

邦德赶忙急切地说：“太想了。除了赚钱，工作还有什么别的意义吗？”

“不过不幸的是，赚大钱一般都需要很长时间。等赚够了钱，人也就老了，没有什么机会享受了。”

“这就是问题所在。我一直在寻求一种捷径，不过在这儿是找不到了，这里的税太重。”

“的确，而且法律也太严了。”

“是，我发现赚钱的办法了。”

“是吗？”

“曾经贩过一阵子毒，趁没有出事就收手了，当然了，这事儿没什么前途。”

金手指耸了耸肩：“邦德先生，有人说法律是这个社会上偏见赤裸裸的体现，我非常同意这种说法。在贩毒这个问题上，这一点体现得更为透彻。就算不是，我对于协助警方调查也没什么兴趣。”

“呵呵，事情是这样的……”邦德将布莱克威尔替换成自己，讲了墨西哥贩毒的事。他最后说：“我能逃脱真的是很幸运，但是通过这事儿，我并没有在环球出口公司获得更好的人缘。”

“我敢说不是这样的，这故事很有意思。您好像很有计谋，您对继续从事这一行没有兴趣了？”

邦德耸了耸肩：“这活儿有点太困难了。就像那个墨西哥人说的，如果事情不顺了，那就说明做这一行的大人物影响还不够大。当遇到困难的时候，除了骂上几句，他根本就无力反抗。”

“好了，邦德先生，”金手指从餐桌前站了起来，邦德也赶紧照做。“今天晚上真是过得很愉快。我想我不会贩毒，还有别的更安全的生财之道。您要做的就是记住这个道理：机会合适的时候，千万别犹豫。让自己的财富翻番并不是件容易的事情，机会错过了可能就很难再找回来了。您愿意听听我的另一句格言吗？”

“请赐教。”

“呵呵，邦德先生，”金手指脸上露出了有钱人常有的那种淡淡的微笑，“让一个人手里的钱翻番的方法就是将钱对折，放进口袋里。”

邦德心里暗暗地骂了几句，表面上却恭敬地笑了笑，没有说话。现在情况发展得还不够理想，一点进展都没有。但是直觉告诉他他应该坚持下去，不能松懈。

他们回到了大厅里。邦德伸出手：“嗯，非常感谢您丰盛的晚餐。我该回去睡了，改天有机会我们再约。”

金手指轻轻按了一下邦德的手，然后把它从自己面前推开了。这又是一个有钱人因为对与人进行肢体接触有着下意识的恐惧而形成的行为习惯。他严肃地看着邦德，神秘莫测地说：“如果我们再次见面，我一点也不会感觉到奇怪的，邦德先生。”

在跨过塞恩的伊勒河回去的一路上，邦德开着车穿梭在明亮的月光中，脑子里面一遍又一遍地回味着金手指这句话。他脱掉衣服躺在床上，还在想着这句话，但是猜不透金手指是什么意思。这句话可以理解为金手指愿意进一步联系邦德，但是也可以理解为邦德会想方设法进一步接近金手指。抛硬币吧，正面代表前一种意思，背面代表后一种意思。邦德起身从梳妆台上拿了一枚硬币，抛了起来。是背面。代表着邦德得主动接近金手指了！

好，那就这么办！但是下次见面，他的故事可得编的圆满一点儿，他们必须是“巧遇”对方的。邦德重新躺下，很快就睡着了。

第十二章　银精灵背后的长尾巴


第二天早晨九点整，邦德向参谋长汇报：“我是詹姆斯。我看过了他的房子，到处都探查过了。昨晚跟主人吃了晚饭。我现在能够确定主任的看法是正确的。那房子有点不对劲儿。我现在掌握的信息还不足以让我向您提交一份鉴定报告。今天房子的主人要出国，从菲丽菲尔德乘飞机出发。但愿我能打听到他出发的时间。我希望再看一眼他那辆车，在那上面安一部便携式的无线电发射器。您能让庞森比小姐帮我订购一下吗？我今天晚些时候过来取。目前还不了解他出行的目的地，我会密切保持联系的，您那边有什么情况吗？”

“昨天的高尔夫胜败如何？”

“我赢了。”

电话那头传来了笑声：“我想也是。奖金颇为丰厚啊，不是吗？”

“您怎么知道的？”

“昨晚伦敦警察厅的人打了电话。说他接到了一个电话，说有一个跟你同名的家伙名下拥有巨额来历不明的财产。他问我们有没有这么个人，情况是否属实。这人级别不高，他根本不知道关于环球公司的事。我告诉他去问自己的长官，今天早晨我们接到一个道歉电话，同时你的秘书在你邮箱里发现了一封装有一万美元的邮件。你的对手很是狡猾，对吧？”

邦德微微一笑，这是典型的金手指式的做法，想利用这些钱给邦德制造点麻烦。很有可能比赛一结束他直接就给伦敦警察厅打了电话。他就是想给邦德一个警告，你打了我一拳，至少你自己手上也得扎上一根刺。但是似乎环球公司这个掩护效果还不错。邦德说：“手段毒辣啊。你可以转告主任，这次的钱就捐给白十字会了，我刚才说的事情没问题吧？”

“当然。过几分钟给你回电话。但是你自己在国外多注意。如果你感觉到无聊了需要陪伴，马上给我们打电话。再会。”

“再见。”邦德放下听筒。他站起身来开始收拾行李。他仿佛亲眼看到了参谋总长办公室里那就将发生的一幕，参谋总长像回放录像带一样将自己的话转述给莫尼佩妮小姐：“他说他也认为金手指在搞什么大阴谋，但是具体是什么还不能确定。金手指今天早晨要带着他的汽车从菲丽菲尔德乘坐飞机离开。007想进行追踪。（预定比金手指的飞机大概晚上两小时的航班，适当与他保持距离。你来安排吧，好吗？）他希望我们提前跟海关打个招呼，确保他能近距离观察一下金手指的那辆劳斯莱斯，并且在后备厢里安装一个追踪器（你顺便把这个也给他准备好），如果有任何需要他会随时用电台与你保持联系……”诸如此类。这个组织工作效率还是很高的。

邦德收拾好行李，伦敦就打来了电话，通知给他做好了一切安排。他下楼结了账，很快离开了拉姆斯盖特，踏上了去往坎特伯雷的路途。

伦敦方面说金手指预定了一架专机，12点整起飞。邦德于11点到达了菲丽菲尔德，向护照总控制中心以及已经在等候他的海关官员进行了自我介绍，将开来的车藏进了一个空的飞机库。然后坐下吸了根烟，跟管护照的工作人员谈了谈工作上的事儿。他们以为他是伦敦警察厅的。邦德也没有加以纠正，随他们那么想吧。“不，”他说，“金手指也许没有什么大问题。也许只是他的几个仆人把一些东西从这个国家走私出去呢，非常秘密的。我能不能得到一个跟那辆车密切接触10分钟的机会呢？”

他想看看工具箱。海关会给这辆汽车颁发隐藏在隔间里的A级许可证吗？他们肯定会的。

11：45时，一个海关的工作人员在门口探了探头，朝邦德眨了眨眼：“现在进来了。司机登机了。我马上去，请他们两个人都在汽车装上飞机之前登机，我就说是重量分配方面的原因，这理由听起来没有那么假。我们都知道这辆老爷车，那是辆装甲车，有三吨重。我们一准备好就叫您。”

“多谢。”他们都出去了。邦德从他的口袋里拿出了一个看起来不怎么结实的小包裹。里面装着一截连接在真空管上的干电池。他检查了一下用来连接的电线，然后又将它放回到自己的上衣口袋里，继续等着。

11∶55，门开了。一个工作人员向他招手示意：“没问题。他们都上飞机了。”

那辆巨大的银精灵汽车闪闪发光，放在海关的一个隔间里，飞机上的人是看不见的。这个隔间里还有另外一辆车，是一辆纯灰色的凯旋TR3敞篷车，车篷已经放下来了。邦德走到劳斯莱斯的后面。海关的工作人员已经将后备厢里备用的板子卸了下来。邦德快速地将工具盘拉出来，只用了一分钟就将工具和托盘都检查完毕。他跪了下来。他假装翻看后备厢的侧面，同时偷偷地把上衣口袋里那个连着电池的真空管放了进去。他还更换了一个工具托盘，很合适。他站起身来，双手在一起搓了搓。“没什么。”他对海关的人说。

一个工作人员把板子重新安上，用螺丝钉钉住。他站起来说：“底盘和车身都没什么可疑的地方。框架里和内饰有很多空间，但是如果不费一番力气恐怕也没办法搜查。现在可以走了吗？”

“可以了，谢谢。”邦德回到办公室。他又听到了那熟悉的打火的声音。一分钟后，汽车从那个隔间开了出来，稳稳地开向了装载坡台。邦德站在办公室里，看着它慢慢地被运送到坡台上。那架布里斯托尔飞机的货仓口“咣”的一声关闭了。装载垫子被撤走，调度员竖起了一根拇指。飞机上的两个发动机像剧烈的咳嗽一样轰鸣起来，这只“大银蜻蜓”的轮子也快速地在跑道上滚动起来。

飞机驶上跑道之后，邦德走到自己的车前，坐到了司机的座位上。他按动了一个按钮。在片刻的安静之后，车里的一个隐藏着的喇叭突然发出了响亮刺耳的声音。邦德转动一个旋钮，那刺耳的声音逐渐消失，变成了一种低沉的嗡嗡声。邦德一直等到飞机完全起飞。随着飞机的高度越来越高，向着海岸的方向越飞越远，那种低沉的噪音也逐渐越变越小，五分钟后，彻底消失了。邦德又调了调台，重新找到了信号。他又跟踪了五分钟左右，飞机穿越了海峡，他就把电台关掉了。他将车开出海关的飞机库，告诉航空公司的工作人员他会在1∶30回来乘坐2∶00的飞机，然后就开着车慢慢地朝拉伊一个他知道的酒馆驶去了。从现在开始，只要他和金手指的劳斯莱斯及那架飞机的距离不超过100英里，那个由他放置在劳斯莱斯后备厢里的无线电发射器就会一直向邦德的接收器传送信号。他只需要密切关注信号，不要让那嗡嗡的声音消失就可以了。这是用来确定方向的简单方法，利用这种方法可以让一辆车在完全不被注意的情况下揪住另一辆车的“长尾巴”。到了海峡的另一边，邦德需要调查清楚金手指在勒图凯是走的哪条路。先确定下大致的范围，然后再把每一个岔路和十字路口摸清。有时候，邦德也许会做出错误的判断，因此需要适时地加快车速赶上，这就由那辆阿斯顿马丁DBIII负责了。在整个欧洲玩这种猎犬追兔的游戏肯定会很有趣的。

当时晴空万里，艳阳高照。邦德一时之间感觉到一股兴奋之情在自己的体内冲撞着。他对自己笑了笑，这笑容显得沉重、冷漠而又无情。他想，金手指，这辈子第一次，你遇到麻烦了，而且是大麻烦。

在勒图凯安静的N38公路与嘈杂的N1主路交叉的路口，总是会有一个自行车代理商。没错，他肯定看见那辆劳斯莱斯往哪边开走了。如此与众不同的一辆车不会有人注意不到的。“那辆车真的很有派头。往右去了，先生，朝阿布维尔方向。过去大约一小时了，但是您开得这么快……”

自从邦德在机场打开了设备，他就检测到了那辆劳斯莱斯的信号。但是他没有办法确定金手指到底是往北去了——朝荷兰、比利时、卢森堡这几个低地国家或奥地利或德国方向——还是向南去了。他得需要两辆能够接收无线电信号的汽车才能做到确定目标的行进方向。邦德向自行车商挥了挥手，猛加油门开动了汽车。他得快点追上去。金手指现在可能已经过了阿布维尔，没准儿已经拐上了N1公路的一个岔路向巴黎方向或是转上N28公路向鲁昂方向驶去了。如果邦德做出了错误判断的话可能还会浪费很多的时间和路程。

邦德沿着弯曲的公路蜿蜒行驶。虽然他尽量稳重行事，但是只用了15分钟就走完了通往阿布维尔那43英里的路程。这时接收器接收到的信号很强了。金手指最多也就在前方20英里的地方了。但是此处是一个岔路口，他朝哪个方向去了呢？邦德猜测着选择了巴黎那边。他驱车前行。一时之间，接收器的信号变得有点儿不稳定了。他的猜测是对是错呢？但是，不久之后，信号的声音就变得越来越弱了。妈的！是调转车头，还是继续向前，等下一个路口再转向鲁昂方向，在目的地追上金手指呢？邦德讨厌调头。于是他决定继续向前行驶。在距离博维10英里的地方右转。一开始路不太好走，但是随后他就开上了N30高速路，朝鲁昂飞驰而去。一路上他紧紧地跟踪着信号。邦德在郊外停了下来，找了个米其林经销商打听了点儿情况。根据信号显示，他应该已经超过金手指了。但是前面又是一个重要的岔路口，如果这次猜错了可能就没那么容易继续追踪了。金手指既有可能选择南边的艾伦哥—勒芒旅游路线，也有可能选择东南方向，掠过巴黎，走埃夫勒、沙特尔、奥尔良这一线。邦德不敢冒险接近鲁昂中心地带，那样有可能会撞见金手指的劳斯莱斯。他需要耐心等待，等信号逐渐变弱之后再作出自己的猜测。

过了15分钟，邦德确定金手指的劳斯莱斯已经过去了。这一次，他还是选择了左边的岔路口。他将油门踩到底，加速猛追。不久之后，接收器的信号越来越强，他走对路了。他将车速降下来，将接收器的音量调小，不紧不慢地向前行驶，心里琢磨着，金手指这是要去哪里呢？

五点、六点、七点。从邦德的后视镜看，太阳都下山了，金手指的车还没有停下来。他们穿过了德勒和沙特尔，一直开进了奥尔良。还是夜幕的降临才能使金手指停下脚步——他已经连续行驶了六个小时，走过了250英里的路程，金手指一路上一定没有觉得疲惫。在城区外，他也一定会让他的那辆老银精灵保持最快的车速。邦德开始加速，赶了上去。

前面看到了模模糊糊的车灯。邦德打开了雾灯，又打开了远光灯。原来是一辆小型跑车，邦德跟了上去，是一辆名爵，还是凯旋？还是奥斯汀·希利？原来是一辆浅灰色带顶篷的两座凯旋。邦德闪了闪大灯，超了过去。前面还有另一辆车的灯光，邦德用车灯探寻着，向着薄雾开了过去。那辆车在大概一英里的前方。邦德慢慢地追上前去。将他的远光灯快速地一开一关，看了一眼。没错，就是那辆劳斯莱斯。邦德又降低车速，与劳斯莱斯保持着大概一英里的距离，同时从后视镜里用余光观察着后面那辆TR3发出的微弱的灯光。到了奥尔良郊区，邦德在路边停了车，那辆凯旋不紧不慢地超过了他。

邦德以前都从来没有关注过这里，这是一个充斥着牧师和神话的城市，既没有魅力也没有什么娱乐。这地方以圣女贞德知名，甚至是从游客口袋里掏钱的时候都摆出一副严肃而神圣的表情。邦德提前向米其林经销商咨询过了地形。金手指有可能下榻在其中一家五星级酒店，晚餐享用煎鲽鱼片和烤鸡。对他来说，今天有可能是一次现代版的实景死亡游戏。其实邦德很愿意住在城外，就选择卢瓦尔河畔的一家精致的小旅馆，舒舒服服地享用点鹿肉丸子。但是他的对手狡猾无比，他必须紧紧跟随。他觉得应住在车站大酒店，晚餐就吃车站的自助餐。

每次有疑虑的旅途中，邦德总是会选择车站的酒店。条件还过得去，也方便停车，而且车站自助餐经常也不错。此外，住在车站附近，你好像能够触摸到一个城市的心跳似的。夜晚火车发出的声音充满了悲怆而又浪漫的色彩。

信号接收器接收的信号非常稳定，这种状态已经持续了十来分钟了。邦德特意留心了一下通往三个旅馆的路，谨慎地悄悄溜进了城。他一路沿着灯火辉煌的河岸向前走去。事实证明他的猜测是正确的，那辆劳斯莱斯确实停在了奥卡兹大酒店的门前。邦德随即调转车头回到城里，寻找落脚的酒店。

车站旅馆确实如他先前期望的那样——便宜、传统又很舒适。邦德洗了个热水澡，之后开着车去确认了一下劳斯莱斯并没有开走。之后，来到了车站饭店吃了一顿他最爱的晚餐——两个小盅蛋，一份香煎板鱼（奥尔良邻近海边，卢瓦尔河的鱼一般会有点腥臭肮脏），还有一大份法国软质乳酪。他喝了一品脱冰镇的安茹玫瑰酒，还要了一瓶轩尼诗三星白兰地和咖啡。大约10∶30，他走出饭店，又一次确认了一下金手指的车，又沿着街道散了大概一小时的步。之后，又确认了一下那辆车，然后回去睡了。

第二天一早6∶00，那辆劳斯莱斯还是没动地方。邦德结了账，在车站那边一个咖啡馆要了一杯双倍浓缩的咖啡，将车顺着河边开过去，倒进了一个小巷里。这一次，他已经没有任何资本犯错了。

金手指行进的方向有可能是过河，有可能是向南走N7公路去里维埃拉方向，也有可能是沿着卢瓦尔河的北岸行驶，但目的地也是里维埃拉或是去瑞士、意大利这些地方。邦德下了车，在河堤的矮墙边闲逛着，从法国泡桐那粗壮的树干中间张望着。上午8∶30，两个身影从奥卡兹大酒店门口走了出来，劳斯莱斯发动了。邦德看着车沿着河岸驶去，直到看不见了为止。邦德赶紧上了自己那辆阿斯顿马丁，追了上去。

邦德在夏日清晨的阳光中沿着卢瓦尔河行驶着，感觉到了一丝惬意。这里是这个世界上他最喜欢的地方之一。正值五月，果树在阳光的照射下闪耀着白色的光芒，受到冬季降水的影响，河里依然水量充足，整个山谷都披上了一层绿色的外衣，显得生气勃勃。他正在新堡前面沉醉于这美好的景色，突然，一声尖锐的喇叭声打破了他的沉思，紧接着，一辆凯旋从他身边呼啸而过。这辆车这次没有拉起车篷，车里模模糊糊是一个漂亮女人的身影。她的半张脸都被一副白色边框深蓝色镜片的护目镜遮住了。尽管邦德只看到了一个侧面的轮廓——一副红唇和一条粉红色带白色波点的围巾下飘扬着的黑色发丝，但是他从这名女子昂着头的姿势就可以判断，这肯定是个美女，因为一个平时备受仰慕的女子自然会有这份自信。更何况，一个女子独自开车行驶在路上，还毫不犹豫地超了一个开着好车的男人，那个女子一定是非同凡响。

邦德心想：今天本可以发生这样的故事——卢瓦尔河披上新装就是为了这场艳遇——我可以一直尾随这位美女，午餐时分可以追上她，在河边一家清幽的餐馆跟她搭上话，就在那花园里的紫藤架下，吹着吊扇，喝着冰镇的沃莱白葡萄酒，彼此敏锐地探寻着对方。然后，两辆车并驾齐驱，直到黄昏。两人到了午餐时约定好的目的地——南部的一个地方，倚着橄榄树，听着湛蓝的夜空下蟋蟀的叫声，发现彼此都喜欢对方，自己原来追求的目标都可以暂时搁置一下。第二天（“不是今晚。我对你还不够了解，况且我也太累了。”）将她的车留在酒店的车库里，一起乘坐自己的车慢慢行驶，可以不用赶时间，一路向西，避开嘈杂的大路，专走清净的小路。那个他一直想去的地方叫什么来着？当时特别向往就是因为它的名字。哦，对，是“双网之间”，那个雷堡附近的村庄，那里可能连个小旅店都没有。然后，他们会一起去雷堡——那个位于卡玛格边界上隆河口的一个小村庄。他们会在那里一家精致的巴曼尼尔酒店选择两个相邻的房间入住（不要双人间，时机还不够成熟）。那家酒店是法国唯一一家带餐厅的酒店，曾经受到过米其林的最高嘉奖。他们可能会点一道香烤龙虾，因为在这样的夜晚人们经常会点这样的菜品。他们还会喝点儿香槟，再然后……

想到这里，邦德微微笑了一下，给自己编的这个故事画上了一个句号。今天不行，你有任务。今天你只能追踪金手指，没有机会去追求什么爱情。今天，你能闻的只能是金手指用的那昂贵的须后水的气味儿，而不是……她用什么香水呢？英国女人一向不擅长用香水。他希望那是一种淡淡的清爽的香味儿，比如巴尔曼的绿色草原，或是卡伦的铃兰。邦德打开信号接收器确认方向，然后加速行驶，整个人都很放松，脑子里不断想着那个女郎，不断地给自己的故事补充着细节。当然，他很可能还会再见到她，他们的步调好像非常一致。她昨晚一定也是在奥尔良过的夜。在哪儿呢？大好的机会浪费了……但是等一下！邦德突然从他的白日梦里惊醒了。那敞开的车篷好像让他想起了什么。他以前见过那辆凯旋。那是在菲丽菲尔德，一定是在金手指之后乘坐的飞机。当时他确实没有看见那个女郎和车牌号，但是绝对不会错，就是这辆车。如果真是这样，那么跑了300英里之后他还紧紧地跟在金手指的身后就不是巧合那么简单了。而且，昨晚开车的时候，她的车灯的确也是开得很昏暗！这是怎么一回事？

邦德加速追了上去，他马上就到纳韦尔了。不管如何，在下一个路口之前，他也必须得向前赶一赶了。不如来个一箭双雕，顺便也看看这个女人要干什么。如果她一直保持在金手指和邦德之间的位置，那么这事儿还真是有点儿令人恼火，那会是个不小的麻烦。单纯追踪金手指就够难的了，如果他们两个之间还夹上另一条尾巴，那可就是难上加难了。

她还在那儿，劳斯莱斯后面大概距离两英里的地方，紧紧跟随着。看到她那“闪光的小尾巴（邦德自己给起的名字）”的那一刻，邦德放慢了车速。嗯，嗯！那是谁？这是怎么一回事？邦德一边开车继续向前行驶着，脸上的表情变得越来越阴郁，逐渐陷入了沉思。

那辆车一直紧随劳斯莱斯之后。三辆车继续沿着闪着黑色光泽的N7公路行驶。那条公路此刻在邦德眼中就像一条粗黑的绷紧的神经，一直向法国的心脏穿过去。但是到了穆兰，邦德差一点儿就跟丢了。他不得不原路返回，又上了N73公路。原来金手指在那个路口向右转了弯，向里昂和意大利方向或是梅肯和日内瓦方向去了。邦德加快了车速，还好发现得及时，没有出大问题。这次他没有怎么依赖信号接收器，而是看到了前面那辆凯旋才将车速降低了。突然，他听见信号接收器原本嗡嗡的声音猛地变大，像动物发出了一声哀号。他当时的车速是90公里，要不是他反应快，刹车及时，没准儿就撞上前面的劳斯莱斯了。当时他刚好爬上了一个小坡，那辆巨大的黄色汽车已经在一英里以外的路边停了下来，要想降低车速慢慢从后面蹭过去已经来不及了。但是，谢天谢地，那块儿正好有一个小岔路，邦德赶紧拐上去，往前开了一小截儿，在一处低矮的树篱的掩护下停了车。他从汽车的杂物箱里拿出了一副小型双筒望远镜，下了车，往回走了一段。妈的！金手指选了一个小桥下的位置坐在了小溪边上。他穿着一件白色的风衣，戴着一顶白色的亚麻布驾驶帽，打扮得像个德国游客。此刻，他正坐在那儿野餐。看到这一幕，邦德自己也觉得饿了。他午饭吃什么呢？他仔细观察了一下劳斯莱斯。从后窗可以隐隐约约看见那个韩国人坐在前座上的身影，但是没有看到那辆凯旋的影子。如果那个女人一直在尾随金手指，那么金手指突然停下她一定来不及反应。她只能掩面低头，继续往前开了。现在她应该已经在前面的某个地方埋伏着，等着金手指的车跟上去了。或者有没有其他可能呢？也许邦德之前的判断出了错，或许她只是要去意大利的某个湖边，看望她的亲戚朋友或爱人呢。

望远镜那头的金手指此刻已经站起身来。爱干净的男人，不错呢，只见他把地上的碎纸捡起来，小心地塞到桥下。他为什么不直接扔到小溪里呢？猛然间，邦德的下巴收紧了。金手指的这些做法似曾相识，它们让他想到了什么？邦德这次还是在虚构故事吗？或者这座桥实际上是一个“邮筒”？是不是金手指收到了命令，要在这座桥下藏上什么东西，比如一根金条？法国、瑞士、意大利——不管这些人在其中哪个国家，这个地点都非常方便——比如对方有可能是里昂的共产主义分子，他们在法国是势力最为强大的一支。此外，这个地方视野也非常开阔，方便观察前后路上的情况。

金手指爬上了岸边。邦德赶紧退回到树篱后面。随后，他听到远处传来了那熟悉的汽车打火的声音。他小心翼翼地观察着金手指的劳斯莱斯，一直到它从视野里消失不见了。

那是一条风景美丽的小溪，桥也建得精致。桥身上刻着一组数字——79/6——表示它是从某个城镇开始在N79公路上建造的第六座桥梁。所以这座桥也很容易找到。邦德赶紧下了车，快速朝河岸走去。拱桥下面黑暗阴冷，河水清澈见底、流速缓慢，可以看到鹅卵石遍布河床，很多鱼在水中游来游去。邦德开始在草丛边的砖石结构的桥身边搜索。就在中间地带，大概就是桥面的正下方，邦德发现墙边有一丛杂草长得极为茂密。邦德扒开草丛。一片土地显然刚刚被翻动过。邦德徒手挖了起来。

找到了，但是只有一块。那东西摸起来滑滑的，形状像个砖块。邦德费了点儿力气才把它拿了起来。他将那暗黄色的金属块儿上的泥土扫了扫，用手帕包了起来，藏到上衣里面，爬到岸上，向那空无一人的公路走去。





第十三章　“您要是再碰我那个地方……”


邦德为自己的做法感到有点高兴。很多人会因为金手指办事不力而生气。两万英镑不是小数目，能办不少事呢。现在，制定好的计划也不得不临时更改，阴谋诡计不得已向后推迟了，没准他还无意中救了几条人命呢。一旦“间谍之死”追查起来——这种情况出现的概率似乎不大，他们很现实，只会想方设法减少损失，不会再作白费力气的尝试——估计情况就会被解释为某个流浪汉发现了金条，把它拿走了。

邦德打开藏在副驾驶座位下的一个暗格，将金条塞了进去。这是个危险的东西。他得与情报机构的下一个联络站联系，把金条移交给他们。他们会将它送回伦敦。邦德必须快点汇报。它能证明很多情况。M可能还要派人把这座桥监视起来。邦德希望这种情况不要发生。在他逐渐接近金手指的过程中，他不希望有任何事来惊扰他。他只希望金手指头顶的天空阳光灿烂，万里无云。

邦德发动了汽车，现在他还有更重要的事要关心。他必须在到达梅肯之前追上金手指的劳斯莱斯，而在下一个路口他得在日内瓦和里昂之间做出正确的选择。他还需要解决那个女郎的问题，最好是让她出局，不管漂亮与否，她现在让情况变得更复杂了。另外，他也得找个地方停下了吃点东西了。现在已经是下午一点了，刚才看见金手指吃饭让他也感觉到了饥饿。跑了这么远，也是时候给车加点儿油加点儿水了。

信号接收器的嗡嗡声又变大了，他已经到了梅肯郊区。此时，他必须得冒着被发现的危险跟紧一点了。这里交通繁忙，比较有利于他掩藏自己的行踪。要知道劳斯莱斯到底是跨过了索恩河朝布尔格方向去了，还是没有过桥，直接右转上了通往里昂的N6公路。在朗布街上远远的地方，邦德看见了一丝亮黄色。就在铁路桥上，隔着一个小广场。那辆高高的黄色箱子一样的汽车一直朝河边开去。邦德看见路人纷纷转头向那辆劳斯莱斯行注目礼。转眼车开到了河边。金手指是会右转还是上桥呢？结果劳斯莱斯继续朝前开去了。那么他就是要去瑞士了！邦德一直尾随着来到了圣洛朗的郊区。好了，现在是时候找点吃的喝的了。在前方一百码左右的人行路上，一颗金色的牛头高高悬挂着。邦德朝他的后视镜扫了一眼。呵！那辆凯旋正在他的车身后紧紧跟随。她是什么时候跟上来的？邦德之前跟踪劳斯莱斯的心情太迫切了，以至于进城以来都没看过后视镜。

她肯定是在某条小街道里藏着了。那现在看来，她的出现不可能是巧合了，得采取点措施了。不好意思了，亲爱的，我得给你捣捣乱了，我会尽量绅士一些的。注意了！邦德在那个肉店门前突然一个急刹车，停了下来，还往后倒了一点儿。一声尖锐的剐蹭声传来，让人心里顿生厌烦之情。邦德熄火，下了车，他走到车后面查看。那辆凯旋上的女郎脸绷得紧紧的，一脸气愤的样子。她的一条腿已经迈出车门，搭在了车旁的地上。邦德不小心看见了女郎那白白的大腿。女郎扯下护目镜，站起身来，只见她两腿绷直站着，双手叉腰，漂亮的双唇因为愤怒而紧绷着。

邦德那辆阿斯顿马丁的后保险杠已经嵌进了女郎那辆凯旋的车灯和水箱里。邦德和蔼可亲地说：“您要再碰我那个地方，您可就得嫁给我了。”

话音未落，女郎的一只巴掌已经落在了他的脸上。邦德伸手抚摸了一下脸颊。这时旁边已经围上来了一帮人，人们低声议论着，有赞赏的，有说下流话的。

这一巴掌并没有让女郎消了气：“你这混蛋！你知不知道自己干了些什么？”

邦德想漂亮女人生气的时候也是美人儿，说：“您的刹车肯定不好用吧。”

“我的刹车！你这是什么意思？是你倒车撞到的我。”

“档自己滑脱了，我也不知道您跟的这么近啊。”邦德觉得是该安抚她一下，让她平静下来的时候了。“我真心向您道歉，您修车的费用都由我来出，真是够倒霉的。咱们看看车受损的程度吧。您把车倒一下，别让咱们的保险杠卡在一起啊。”邦德一只脚踏在凯旋的保险杠上，开始摇晃起来。

“你还敢碰我的车！给我滚开！”女郎气愤地坐到了驾驶座上，打着了火。烟囱罩下面传来了金属碰撞的声音。她关上发动机，将身子探出。“嘿！你这笨蛋！你把我的风扇撞坏了。”

邦德正求之不得呢。他上了自己的车，将车往前开了一点儿。由于失去了邦德的汽车保险杠的支撑，凯旋前面的一些碎片叮叮当当地掉落到了地上。邦德又从车里下来。这时人群散去了一些，人群里有一个修理工，会修各种机械，他自告奋勇去叫一辆救援车辆，转身走开了。邦德走到凯旋旁边，女郎已经下了车，正站在那里等他，她脸上的表情已经发生了改变。现在她已经镇静了下来，邦德注意到她那深蓝色的眼睛正在认真地盯着邦德的脸。

邦德说：“情况真的不算太糟糕，可能只是把风扇撞歪了。他们会帮你在灯座上装上临时车灯，把撞歪的金属部分弄直。明天早晨肯定能搞定。现在，”邦德从口袋里掏出钱夹，“我知道这件事儿让您很生气，我当然是难逃罪责。这是十万法郎，作为您修车的费用，还有今晚的食宿费用，以及给您的朋友打电话通知的费用。请您收下，别再生气了。我也很希望今晚能留在这里等一切处理清楚再离开。但是我今晚有个重要的约会，我恐怕还得先走一步了。”

“不行。”女郎的语气冰冷而坚决。她把双手放在背后，停顿了一下。

“但是……”她想怎么样？报警吗？让他们以危险驾驶的名义逮捕他？“我今晚也有个约会。我也必须得去。我今晚必须到日内瓦。你开车带我去怎么样？也不是很远，大概100英里的路程吧，有两个小时就到了。”女郎指了指邦德的阿斯顿马丁DBIII。“可以吗？麻烦了。”

听得出来，她的语气里有一种非常急迫的情绪，不是甜言蜜语，也不是威胁，只是非常热切的需求。

先前邦德一直觉得这个漂亮女郎只是在努力创造机会跟金手指接触想让他爱上自己，或是想用什么理由敲诈金手指，他觉得只有这种可能性才符合事实。现在他才第一次认真地考虑这个女郎的意图，看来这两种可能性都不是，这张脸上的表情太过直率了，而且她的穿着也说不上性感诱人：她上身穿了一件白色的丝质衬衫，厚厚的，剪裁偏男性化；领口微微敞开露出了一点脖子；衬衫的袖子又肥又长，袖口处还紧紧地系上了扣子；手上也没涂指甲油，身上唯一的饰品就是中指上戴着的一枚金戒指（她订婚了，真的假的？）；她腰上系着一条黑色的缝制皮带，上面有两个黄铜的皮带扣；皮带在后背处稍稍抬高了一些，给她腰上穿着的赛车手穿的束缚带一点儿支撑力；她下身穿着一条炭灰色的百褶短裙；脚上的一双黑色凉鞋看起来价值不菲，日常穿着和开车都应该很舒适。她身上唯一的亮色就是原来在头上戴着的粉红色纱巾了，而现在也已经被她扯了下来，和那副白色的护目镜一起拿在一只手中。这身装束看起来很精神，但总是让邦德感觉不像单纯女郎的装束。她的外表和行为动作隐隐约约透出一些男子气和户外的气息。邦德想，或许她是一名英国女子滑雪队的运动员，或者在英国的时候经常去狩猎或者骑马什么的。

虽然她人长得很漂亮，但她应该是那种不怎么在意自己美貌的人。她的发型没有经过刻意的修整。于是，她的发型非常具有女性特点——有点凌乱，一些碎发散落着，头发分区的界线也弯弯的。在这造型随意的深色头发的映衬下，她的脸庞显得白皙而精致，黑黑的眉毛下面一双蓝色的眼睛，性感的嘴唇，高高的颧骨和精致的下巴透着一股坚定和独立的精神。她的身姿同样也透露出了一种自立的气息。她身子挺得直直的，美胸骄傲地高耸着，把身上的衬衫都绷紧了。她双脚微微分开站立着，双手背后，仿佛肩负着什么使命或者要挑战什么似的。

这女郎的神情动作仿佛都在说：“好吧，你这个帅气的混蛋，别以为你能像打发小女人那样糊弄我。你把我扯进这烂摊子中，那你也得负责把我拉出去！你人长得不错。但是我有自己的生活，我知道自己要追求什么。”

邦德权衡了一下她的要求。她会给他带来多大的麻烦呢？他需要多长时间才能摆脱她的纠缠，忙自己的正事呢？会不会有什么安全隐患？虽然有种种不利因素，但他还是抑制不住自己对她以及她要做的事情的好奇心，他还记得自己编的那个关于她和自己的故事，而现在，不正是梦想成真的第一步吗？忧伤的少妇，这是一个女人寻求帮助的时候常用的手段。

邦德简短地回答说：“我很愿意带您去日内瓦，那么现在，”他打开了阿斯顿马丁的后备厢，“咱们把您的东西装进来吧。我来安排修车的事，这些钱您拿着，去买点午餐回来吧。您自己随意，我要六英寸的里昂香肠，一块面包，黄油，半升梅肯酒，让他们把瓶塞子打开。”

两人四目相对，进行了眼神交流，这好像是男人与女人之间，主人与奴隶之间的交流。女郎接过钱。“谢谢，我也照着你要的给自己来一份儿。”她走到自己的凯旋旁边，打开了后备厢。“不用麻烦你，我自己能搞定。”她拽出了一个封好的高尔夫球杆袋子，还有一个看起来挺昂贵的行李箱，把它们拿到阿斯顿马丁旁边，不用邦德帮忙，自己亲手将它们放到了邦德的行李箱旁边。然后，她亲眼看着邦德将后备厢锁好，又回到了凯旋的旁边，拿出了一个大大的黑色皮革挎包。

邦德说：“我留谁的名字和地址好呢？”

“什么？”

邦德又将刚才的问题重复了一遍，心里琢磨着，她是会留假名还是假地址，还是两个都留假的呢？

她说：“我快搬家了。最好是留日内瓦贝尔格。人名就留索姆斯，蒂莉·索姆斯小姐。”她说话的时候没有丝毫的犹豫。说完就走进那家肉店去了。

一刻钟后，他们上路了。

那女郎挺直身子坐着，眼睛盯着马路，车上的信号接收器发出很微弱的声音。

劳斯莱斯肯定已经走了50多英里远了。邦德加速追赶着。他们穿过了布尔格，跨过了彭特安大桥。现在走到了苎萝山麓，走到了N84公路的尽头。邦德好像在参加阿尔卑斯挑战赛似的，继续向前驶去。女郎朝邦德的方向晃了两下之后，手紧紧抓住了汽车仪表盘上的扶手，随着车猛冲了出去。那样子好像她是邦德的副驾驶一样。汽车打了个滑，差点带着两个人翻倒，邦德偷偷地瞥了女郎一眼，她的嘴唇和鼻孔都有点微微张开，眼睛绽放出兴奋的光芒，看样子她还挺享受。

他们爬到了一个坡顶，前面下一个坡就是瑞士的边境了。车上的信号接收器的声音响亮而稳定。邦德心想，我得放慢点儿速度了，不然说不定在海关就会碰上他们了。他将手伸到仪表盘下，把音量调小了，然后靠路边停了车。两个人坐在车里吃了点东西，彼此礼貌而安静，谁都没有尝试找个话题聊聊，好像两个人都各自想着心事似的。10分钟后，邦德又发动了汽车。邦德开着车顺着弯弯曲曲的公路，在风中发出飒飒声音的小松树林里穿行着，显得轻松悠闲。

女郎开口说：“那是什么声音？”

“电磁杂音。开得快点儿就会更响。从奥尔良那儿就这样了。今晚得找个地方修修。”

她好像对这敷衍的回答也没什么不满意的，略带踌躇地说：“您这是要去哪儿啊？希望我没让您偏离目的地太多。”

邦德友好地说：“没有，实际上，我也是要去日内瓦。只是今晚可能不会在那儿停留。得看会面的情况而定。您要在那儿待多长时间？”

“我也不确定。我要去打高尔夫球。这是要去参加在迪沃纳举办的瑞士女子公开赛。虽然我还没有那么高的水平，但是我想尝试一下也没有坏处。之后，我还会去其他场地打打球。”

故事编得很合理，听上去没有什么破绽。但是邦德几乎可以肯定这不是百分之百真实的情况。他说：“您常打高尔夫吗？主场是哪儿啊？”

“常打。泰姆普。”

这个问题不难回答。她说的是实话吗，还是只是她脑子里反映出来的第一个球场名呢？“您住在那附近吗？”

“我有个姨妈就住在亨利。您去瑞士做什么？度假吗？”

“出差。进出口业务。”

“噢。”

邦德不禁笑了笑。两个人之间的对话像是在说台词，语气礼貌，又显得有点假。他的眼前仿佛浮现出了英国剧院里经常上演的场景——一对夫妻坐在客厅里的沙发上，法式窗户外面的蜀葵沐浴在暖暖的阳光里，妻子一边倒茶一边问：“加糖吗？”

他们来到了山脚下。面前是一条笔直的道路，远远的地方已经能看见一小片房屋，那里就是法国的海关了。

女郎没有给邦德留下看她护照一眼的任何机会。车一停，她交代了几句整理东西的话，就直奔卫生间而去了。正当邦德进入了控制室，办理汽车临时入境证的时候，她又回来了，护照上已经盖好了章。在关口，她又以从行李箱里拿点儿什么东西为借口离开了。邦德完全没有时间跟她闲聊几句打探点什么信息。

邦德加快车速到达了日内瓦，在贝尔格的入口停了车。

行李托运工帮忙将女郎的行李箱和高尔夫球杆拿了下来。他们站在台阶上告别。她向邦德伸出手，说：“再见。”那双蓝色的眼睛里依然是直率的目光。“谢谢您。您车开得不错，”她嘴角浮现了一丝微笑，“真不明白您在梅肯怎么会挂错了档。”

邦德耸了耸肩：“这种错我也不常犯，但是这次我倒是很高兴。我办完事后也许咱们还能再见。”

“那当然好。”但是她的语气明明在说那是不可能的了。女郎转身穿过弹簧门，从邦德目光里消失了。

邦德赶紧回到车上。让她见鬼去吧！现在该去找金手指了。然后去威尔逊码头的那间小办公室。他打开信号接收器，等了几分钟。金手指应该就在附近，但也是越走越远。他是沿着湖的左岸还是右岸走了呢？从信号判断，他现在已经出城一英里了，走的哪条路呢？如果走左岸，那么就是洛桑方向；如果走右岸，那么就是依云方向。现在，邦德的车已经开上了左边的岔路，他决定让自己的直觉来决定，于是顺着这条路走下去了。

果然，在到达科佩之前，邦德就追上了那辆扎眼的黄色汽车。这是一个因斯塔尔夫人(1)而闻名于世的小村庄。邦德躲在一辆货车后面慢慢跟着。等他再过了一会儿超过货车再看的时候，金手指的车已经看不见了。邦德赶紧加大油门，同时向左边张望着。村庄的入口处，高墙上的两扇厚重的大铁门正在缓缓地关闭。半空中还悬浮着扬起的灰尘。门边蓝底的牌子上用褪色的黄字写着：奥瑞克A.G.公司。这老狐狸，回到他的老窝了！

邦德继续向前行驶，找到一个左转路口。他转了过去，上了一条小路。穿过了一片葡萄园之后，到达了科佩后面的一片树林，呈现在眼前的就是斯塔尔夫人的庄园了。邦德在树林里停了下来。他现在的位置应该是奥瑞克公司的正上方。他拿出自己的双筒望远镜，下了车，顺着一条小路朝小村庄走去。不久之后，他在自己的右手边看到了一排带尖刺的铁栏杆，上面还有一圈倒钩。从山坡往下走大概距离一百来码远的地方，铁栏杆变成了一堵石头砌成的高墙。邦德慢慢顺着小路往回走，看看能不能找到孩子们为了摘栗子弄出来的秘密通道，果然让他找到了，有两根栏杆明显被掰弯了，中间的空隙足够一个小孩钻过去。邦德用尽全身的力气站在较低的那根栏杆上用力踏了踏，将那个缝隙又扩大了几英寸，然后钻了进去。

邦德警惕地在树丛中穿行着，每一步都很小心，尽量躲避着枯树枝。树木慢慢稀疏起来。前面出现了一栋小小的别墅，别墅后面还有一片低矮的房屋。邦德捡起一根粗壮的杉树枝，遮挡在自己身前。他观察着下面的房子。离他最近的一座大概在100码以外，房子前有一个院子。那辆满是灰尘的银精灵此刻就停在那个院子中间。

邦德拿出望远镜，仔细观察着。那是一座布局合理的红砖房，屋顶上铺着石板，一共是两层加一个阁楼，看样子应该有两间正房和四间卧室，墙上覆盖着生长多年的紫藤架，上面开满了花朵，这房子看起来不错。邦德仿佛看到了屋里墙上刷成白色的镶板，闻到了那霉变的屋子经过阳光照射发出的气味。房子的后门通往那个铺着石板的院子，金手指的劳斯莱斯就是停放在这个院子里。这个院子朝向邦德的这一面是敞开的，但是其他两面由两座单层的瓦楞铁皮厂房围着。一根镀锌的烟囱从两座厂房交接的地方高高耸立着。烟囱顶上是一个镀锌的通风帽。通风帽的顶上是一个方形的口子，一直在旋转着，看起来很像我们在船只的舰桥上看到的迪卡雷达扫描仪。那个仪器不断地这样旋转着。邦德想不明白在一个位于树林中的小工厂的屋顶上，这样一个东西到底是干什么用的。

突然，院子里的宁静和静止的气氛被打破了。就好像邦德在布莱顿码头的西洋景的投币口投了一枚硬币一般。不知从哪儿传来了五声刺耳的钟表报时的声音。随后，那座房子的后门打开了，金手指走了出来。他身上还是穿着那件白色的亚麻布风衣，但是这次没戴帽子。他身后跟着一个小个子男人，没什么特点、卑躬屈膝的，蓄着牙刷头一样的小胡子，带着一副角质框架的眼镜。金手指看起来心情不错，他走到他的劳斯莱斯旁边，拍了拍引擎盖。他身边那个小个子男人礼貌地微笑着。他从自己的马甲口袋里拿出一只哨子吹了起来。右边那间车间的门打开了，四个身穿蓝色工装的人鱼贯而出，走到车的旁边。他们身后敞开的门里传来了呼呼的声音，还有正在运作的发动机发出的沉重而有节奏的喷气声，这个场景让邦德突然想起了雷古弗的那家小工厂。

四个工人围绕汽车站了一圈儿。随着那个貌似工头的小个子男人一声令下，他们立即动手将汽车大卸八块了。

他们把四扇门、引擎盖都拆除下来，又开始动手拆卸挡泥板上的铆钉。这时他们的意图已经很明显了，他们正在有条不紊地拆除汽车的装甲层。

几乎就在邦德看出他们这个意图的同时，那个头戴黑色礼帽的身影——“得力”——出现在后门口，朝金手指说了点儿什么。于是金手指向工头交代了一句，就转身回到了屋里。

邦德觉得自己该撤了。他最后仔细地向四周看了看，将这里的地形牢牢记在心里，从树林里退了回去。

“我是环球出口公司的。”

“哦，是吗？”桌子后面的墙上挂着一张安尼戈尼画的女王肖像的复制品。其他几面墙上挂着的则是几幅佛格森拖拉机和其他一些农用机器的广告画。宽大的窗户外面传来了威尔逊码头上的各种嘈杂的声音。一艘汽船鸣响了汽笛。邦德向窗外望去，正好看见不远处的汽船从窗口经过，在这平静如镜面般的夜晚的湖面上留下了一道令人心醉的涟漪。邦德又回过头，看着对面那张和蔼而不动声色的脸，那双眼睛里满是礼貌的询问的神色。

“我们希望能和您合作。”

“什么业务？”

“重要业务。”

那人脸上露出了笑容。他爽朗地说：“您是007，对吧？我早就认出您来了。呵呵，您需要我做什么？”他的声音突然变得谨慎起来，“只是有一样，最好是快点结束，然后您快点离开。自从杜蒙特事件后出现了全城热斗。当地人和雷德兰都监视着我。虽然斗争不怎么暴力，但是您肯定也不希望他们注意到您。”

“我了解，只是日常工作汇报。给——”邦德解开衬衫扣子，拿出那根沉甸甸的金条，“把这送回去，可以吗？尽快吧。”那人拿过一个标签本，将邦德的话用速记记下来。

记完后，他顺手将便签本塞进衣服口袋里：“嗯，嗯！烫手山芋啊。我会照办的。我执行这种任务的时间通常是在半夜。这个，”他指了指金条，“可以先送到伯尔尼。还有别的事吗？”

“听说过科佩的‘奥瑞克公司’吗？做什么的？”

“这一带所有工程商的业务我都了解，职责所需。去年向他们推销过铆钉枪，他们是做金属设备的，东西质量很好，瑞士铁路和航空公司都购买过他们的产品。”

“知道是哪家航空公司吗？”

那人耸了耸肩：“听说那家公司总部在麦加，有飞往印度的包机。他们的终点站在日内瓦，是印度总航空公司的有力竞争对手，麦加的一家私有公司。其实我听说，奥瑞克公司在那家公司预存了些钱，他们乘坐飞机都能享受预订座位的。”

邦德的脸上慢慢露出了一丝冷酷的微笑。他站起身来，伸出了手：“您自己可能不知道，但是您刚才在一分钟内完成了一幅拼图。非常感谢，祝您的拖拉机生意红火，希望我们改天还有机会再见。”

邦德出了门，赶紧上了车，沿着码头向贝尔格方向驶去。情况大致就是这样！两天来，他跟在那辆银精灵后面几乎跨越了整个欧洲。那是一辆装甲车，他亲眼看着那些装甲板在肯特一点点安装上去，然后又在科佩一块块拆下来。那些装甲板现在估计已经进了科佩的熔炉了，准备铸成椅子卖给麦加的航空公司。几天之后，这些椅子又会从到达印度的飞机上拆下来，换成铝制的椅子。金手指会从中赚多少呢？五十万英镑，还是一百万？

因此，“银精灵”并不真是银的，而是地地道道的“金精灵”——整个两吨的车身都是金子，那是实实在在的18K的白颜色的金子。

第十四章　深夜里的“砰砰”声


詹姆斯·邦德入住了贝尔格酒店，洗了澡换了衣服。他掂了掂手里的瓦尔特PPK手枪，犹豫着是把它带在身上还是留下。最后，他决定还是不带了。今晚重返奥瑞克公司，他不希望被人发现。假如运气不佳被人撞见的话，身上带枪肯定会让事态恶化，一场打斗就在所难免了。他已经编好了借口，虽然编得不好，但是起码不至于让他的伪装身份被识破。他暂时还不能失去这个伪装身份。虽然如此，但是邦德还是特意选了一双实际分量比表面看来要重得多的鞋子。

他到前台问了问索姆斯小姐在不在。当接待员回答根本就没什么索姆斯小姐入住在这酒店里的时候，他丝毫也没有感觉到吃惊。邦德唯一的疑问，就是她究竟是在邦德走后离开了这家酒店还是用其他名字登记入住的呢。

邦德开着车穿过了美丽的勃朗峰大桥，沿着灯火通明的码头走到了“巴伐利亚餐厅”。这是一家看起来很普通的阿尔塞斯餐馆，在国际联盟时期曾是一些大人物约见会面的地方。邦德选择了窗边的一个座位，点了恩奇安和卢云堡啤酒。他一坐下就开始思考关于金手指的事了。现在，他的情况已经非常明了了。他资助着一个特务机构，很有可能就是“间谍之死”，而且，他也通过向印度走私黄金赚取巨额利润，那是能够让他得到最高回报的国家。这是他在布里克瑟姆损失了他的拖网渔船后想出的新办法。首先，他到处宣扬他的装甲车，别人只会认为这是他的怪异癖好而已。很多英国的健身爱好者都出售这种汽车，原来通常是卖给印度的王侯们，现在也有很多的石油大亨和南美的领主会买。金手指之所以选择这辆银精灵，是因为通过改装，这车的底盘可以非常牢固，车身具备典型的铆钉特征，并且车身表面金属覆盖面积也大。或许金手指还开着这车出了一两次国，好让菲丽菲尔德的人们熟悉。然后，在下一站的旅行中，他就在雷古弗的工厂里叫人把装甲板拆下来。然后换上18K的白色金子做成的装甲板。这种板子表面有一层镍银合金，十分坚固。万一他遭遇事故或是车身被划伤，露出的金属颜色也能使他免于暴露。随后，车被开到地处瑞士的那家小工厂。这里的工人和雷古弗的工人一样，都是经过他精心挑选的。他们将车上的装甲板拆下来，重新铸造成飞机上用的椅子，然后安装到麦加航空公司的飞机上——可想而知，这家航空公司的经营者甘当金手指的走狗，每运送一趟金子，肯定都会从中得到一定的提成。这样的航行一年可能会有一次、两次，甚至三次。每次飞机上估计只装载少量的重量较轻的货物和少数几个乘客。飞机到孟买或加尔各答时会需要进行翻修，重新装配设备。飞机被送到麦加的飞机库安装新的座椅，而拆下来的旧座椅就卖给了黄金收购商，金手指会在拿骚或是任何他选定的地方收到钱。他从中能够获取100％甚至是200％的利润。然后，整个过程又从头开始，从打着“收购旧黄金”广告的英国金店到雷古弗，到日内瓦，再到孟买。

没错，邦德望着窗外闪着点点星光的湖面想，肯定就是这么回事——这是多么高超的走私手段，风险低，利润大。可以想象，每次金手指的手按响那大蟒一般的车喇叭时，在三国的警察羡慕不已的目光中大摇大摆通过时，一定是心花怒放吧！邦德好像找到了答案——点石成金，点金用的手指！如果他不是那么讨厌的话，如果不是他的所作所为是为了维持“间谍之死”一系列谋杀的话，邦德也不禁对他这非同寻常的手段心生崇拜之情。毕竟，他们做得这么大，这么成功，甚至连英伦银行也不胜困扰了。实际上，邦德只想击败金手指，缴获他的黄金，将他绳之以法。毕竟，金手指对金子的占有欲太强，太冷酷，也太危险。

时间是八点整。那杯恩奇安——由龙胆草蒸馏而来，造成瑞士人慢性酒精中毒的烈酒——让邦德的胃暖了起来，也驱散了他的紧张感。他又点了一杯双份儿的，还点了一份贝尔路和一瓶软糖。

那么关于那个女郎呢？这个漂亮而又有点专制的角色突然出现。她究竟是什么人？这个关于打高尔夫球的借口又是怎么回事？邦德站起来走到屋子最后面的公用电话亭。他拨通了《日内瓦日报》社的电话，并且点名要找体育版的编辑。接电话的人很热情，但是对邦德提出的问题感到有点吃惊。女郎的说法显然不成立，各种锦标赛当然都应该是在夏季举行，那时候各国的比赛都已结束，这样才有机会吸引更多的外国选手来到瑞士，其他欧洲国家举办锦标赛也是这种情况。他们也希望能吸引尽可能多的英国和美国选手参赛，这样入场费的收入就会大大增加。“没有这回事，先生。”

邦德回到了自己的座位继续吃饭。算了，不管她是什么人，她都是个业余的，专业人士不会去使用一个一通电话就能揭穿的借口。虽然邦德很喜欢这个女郎，很为她动心，但是在他内心深处一直在很不情愿地怀疑她是由“间谍之死”派来的特工，目的是来监视金手指或邦德，或是同时监视他们两人的行动。她身上具备特工的一些素质，比如独立精神、坚强的个性、独自行走的能力，等等。但是现在看来，这种可能性可以排除了，显然她没有受过专业的训练。

邦德又点了一条瑞士干酪、一份黑麦面包和咖啡。他继续自己的思路：这女郎就是个谜团，但愿她别搅进来，打乱自己的计划。

而邦德的任务到现在几乎快要完成了。他现在只需要用自己所看到的来证明自己关于金手指和他的劳斯莱斯所设想的故事是真实的。他只需要到科佩的车间里去看上一眼，找到哪怕谷子粒那么大的一点白色金子碎屑，他就可以连夜赶往伯尔尼，通过无线电跟当晚的值班长官汇报了。然后，英伦银行就会不知不觉地冻结金手指在全世界的所有账户，或许就在明天，瑞士警察局的特别小队就会敲响奥瑞克公司的大门。紧接着，金手指就会被引渡回英国布里克斯顿，在那里将对他进行一次像梅德斯通和路易斯那样的走私案审理，低调但是过程复杂。金手指会被判上几年，失去他的英国国籍，他私藏供他非法出口的黄金也会被英伦银行收回到他们的地下保险库里。而“间谍之死”更是会咬紧它那血迹斑斑的牙齿，将这笔账又记到邦德的头上。

走出最后一步棋的时候到了。

邦德结了账，出了门，上了车。他跨过了隆河，沿着灯火闪耀的码头公路慢慢向前行驶。今晚跟他执行任务期间的其他夜晚没有什么区别。头顶上是明亮的半个月亮，寂静的夜里听不到一丝的风声。

好吧，不用着急，他们晚上肯定要加班。邦德必须要格外谨慎、格外小心。车由自动驾驶仪控制着，沿着沉睡的湖边那条宽阔的白色公路平稳地行驶，那个小工厂后面的地形和邦德计划好的路线此刻像放电影一样在邦德眼前一幕幕地闪过。

邦德走的还是下午的原路。驶下主路后，邦德打开了车的侧灯。他小心试探着将车开下车道，在那片树林里的一片小空地上停了下来。然后，他静静地坐着听了听。一片沉寂中，他只听见烟囱罩下那融化的金属发出轻柔的滴答滴答声和报时钟的表针走动发出的急促的咔嗒声。

邦德下了车，轻轻关好车门，悄悄沿着林间小路向前走去。

走着走着，邦德开始听到了柴油机发出的沉重的喷气声，砰嗤……砰嗤……这声音听起来咄咄逼人，让人不禁起了提防之心。邦德找到铁栏杆那个扩大了空隙，钻进去，然后站在原地，绷紧神经观察着前方那斑驳的月光照耀下的树林。

砰嗤……砰嗤……砰嗤，这声音仿佛钻进了他的大脑，怎么也摆脱不掉。邦德感觉腹股沟那里仿佛爬虫爬过一样的奇痒，那种心情就像孩子们在黑夜里第一次玩捉迷藏一样。他自嘲地笑了笑，这高高的镀锌烟囱里传出的声音到底触动了自己那根神经？那是关在笼子里的恐龙的喘息声吗？邦德绷紧了身上的每一块肌肉，迈着小步慢慢摸索着前行，他小心翼翼地把一根根小树枝从自己面前移开，每踏出一步都是无比谨慎，仿佛自己正在雷区上行走似的。

前面的树木开始稀疏起来。很快他就要走到他上午用来掩护自己的那颗树干那里了。正当他寻找那棵树时，突然，他定定地站在那里，心跳不由得加快了。原来，就在他要找的那棵树下此刻有一个人正四肢张开地趴着。

邦德大大地张开嘴，轻声地大口呼吸着，想缓解一下自己的紧张感。他将手心的汗水轻轻在裤子上蹭了蹭。他慢慢蹲下身，双眼睁得像相机的镜头一样，死死地盯着前方。

树下趴着的人身体动了一下，小心地调整了一下姿势。一阵微风掠过了树梢。月光透过舞动的树枝在那个人的身上闪了一下，然后，树枝就又静止不动了。趁着月光一闪的那一刹那，邦德看见了一头乌黑浓密的秀发，黑色毛衣，黑色的窄腿裤子。还有一样东西——地上横着一根直直的金属样的东西。那东西一头在那团黑色的头发下面，另一头伸到了树下的草丛里。

邦德慢慢弯下身子，仔细向前看去，是那个女郎，蒂莉。她正注视着坡下的那座房子。她手里拿着的是一杆来复枪——当时一定是藏在那个高尔夫球杆袋子里了——已经做好准备随时射出子弹了。这愚蠢又该死的女人！

邦德慢慢放松下来。不管她是什么人，要干什么都没关系。他估算了一下距离，心里计算着用几步能够跨过去，每一步跨过多长的距离，能够保证自己刚好停在她的身边，左手能够控制住她的脖子，右手控制住她手里的枪。好吧，就是现在！

邦德一跃而起，他的胸膛从女郎那浑圆的臀部上方滑过去，“砰”的一声落到她的后背上。这一下子产生的冲击将女郎胸腔里的空气几乎全部挤出，让她轻轻发出“哼”的一声。一刹那间，邦德左手的手指伸到了女郎喉咙处，扼住了她的颈动脉，右手则捏住了女郎那拿枪的手腕。他将女郎握枪的手指掰开，摸索着把保险栓拉好，将枪扔到了一边。

邦德将自己的体重从女郎背上移开，手指也放开了她的喉咙。顺势轻轻捂住了她的嘴。他能感觉到自己身下的女郎身体起伏着，努力喘息着，她这一口气到现在还没喘上来。邦德轻轻地将她的两只手拉到背后，用自己的右手控制住。她的臀部扭动着，双腿也开始猛蹬。邦德赶紧用自己的腹部和大腿用力压下去，被他压在身下的身体肌肉紧绷着，奋力反抗。女郎嘴里的呼吸声此刻穿透了邦德的手指发出了有点刺耳的声音。她的牙齿也在邦德手指上咬着。邦德压在女郎身体上小心地往前蹭了几英寸，嘴巴凑到她的耳边，急迫地小声道：“蒂莉，看在上帝的分上，别动！是我，邦德，我不是敌人。这件事很重要，有你不了解的情况。你能不能待着别动，听我说？”

女郎的牙齿不再挣扎着咬邦德的手指了。她的身体也放松下来，不再反抗。过了几秒钟，邦德看见她的头轻轻点了一下。

邦德从她身上下来。在她身边躺下，手里仍然将她的双手扣在她的背后。他小声说：“喘口气，告诉我，你是在跟踪金手指吗？”

女郎那苍白的脸向旁边转过来又很快转回去，对着地面恨恨地说：“我要杀了他！”

金手指的仇家！邦德放开她的双手。她将双手支起来将头托起来，由于筋疲力尽和神经完全放松下来，她的全身都在战栗，肩膀也开始轻轻颤抖。邦德伸出手，轻轻抚摸着她的头发。他的眼睛小心地审视着坡下那平静的一成不变的场景。真的是一成不变吗？不对，是有点变化的。是烟囱帽上那个雷达一样的东西。它现在不转了。此刻，那个东西就在那里静止不动，那个方形的口子敞开着，正对邦德他们现在所在的位置。邦德并不关心女郎和金手指是为什么结的仇。现在她已经不哭了，邦德又将嘴凑到她的耳边。她的头发闻起来有一股茉莉的香味儿。他小声说：“蒂莉，不用担心。我也是跟踪他来的，而且我要给他的惩罚比你能给他的要重得多。我是伦敦派来的，是他们要追捕他。你跟他有什么仇？”

她小声说，仿佛自言自语似的：“他杀了我姐姐，你认识她的——吉尔·玛斯特顿。”

邦德厉声说：“怎么回事？”

“他每个月要一个女人，吉尔刚从事这份工作的时候告诉我的。他会催眠这些女人，然后他——他给她们刷上一层金子。”

“天啊，为什么？”

“我也不知道。吉尔说他对金子痴迷到疯狂的地步。我想他是不是觉得他那样就好像是占有了金子一样。你懂得，娶个金人。他让他的几个韩国仆人给那些女人刷上金子，但是他们要留下女人们的脊梁骨不刷。吉尔也不知道这是为什么。后来我发现这样是为了保住她们的性命。如果全身的皮肤都被金子包裹的话，那么皮肤就不能呼吸了，她们就死了。之后，韩国人会用松香之类的东西帮她们把金子洗掉。金手指会给她们每人1000美元，打发她们离开。”

邦德仿佛亲眼看到了那幅场景，丑陋的“得力”拿着装满黄金涂料的油漆桶，金手指盯着那闪闪发光的金色塑像的贪婪眼神，那疯狂的占有欲。“吉尔是怎么死的？”

“她给我发了电报让我过去。当时她被送到了迈阿密一家医院的急救室。金手指把她开除了，她快要死了，医生们也诊断不出原因。她亲口告诉我事情的来由——金手指对她的所作所为。那天晚上她就死了。”女郎声音沙哑，冷冰冰的，“回到英国后，我就去咨询了皮肤科专家。他给我讲解了这关于皮肤毛孔的知识。有时候一些歌舞女演员也需要扮成银色雕像的样子。他给我看了具体的案例，还有尸体解剖报告。我就明白吉尔是怎么死的了。金手指把她的全身都刷上了金子。他故意杀死她的。肯定是为了报复——报复吉尔跟你走那一趟的事。”她顿了一下，又幽幽地说，“她跟我提起过你，她——她喜欢你，她说如果我有机会见到你，让我把这枚戒指给你。”

邦德紧紧地闭上眼睛，内心一股厌恶之情涌动着。又一条人命！这双手上沾上了更多的鲜血。而这次，仅仅是因为他的一个漫不经心的举动，由于他的一句虚张声势的威胁，却导致了与他愉快地共度了24个小时并且还让他颇为动心的漂亮女郎失去了生命。现在，她给他留下的不仅仅是心动的感觉了。而今，这对金手指自尊小小的伤害却招来了他成千上万倍的报复。“她不在我那儿干了。”两天前在桑德威奇，金手指在阳光下用平淡的语气说出这话的时候，心里一定很痛快吧！邦德攥紧了拳头，指甲几乎都嵌到手心里去了。苍天有眼，就算是死他也要找金手指算这笔账。至于他自己，邦德自己心里清楚，这是工作造成的一部分后果，自己难辞其咎，这件事可能会永生难忘了。

女郎把戴着的戒指从手指上摘下来——那颗刻有双手环绕着一颗心图案的克拉达戒指。她把戒指递到邦德面前，让他拿着。在树干的映衬下，那小小的金色指环在月光下闪着微弱的光芒。

邦德听到了一种介于嘶嘶声和刺耳的汽笛声之间的声音。随着“砰”的一声闷响，一支钢箭的铝制箭羽像鸟的翅膀一样振动着向邦德眼前飞来。箭直飞过来，钉在树干上，邦德手中的戒指叮的一声落到了地上。

邦德慢慢地，几乎漠不关心地转过头。

大概10码以外——一半在月光下，一半在阴影中——一个有着一颗西瓜一样的圆脑袋的身影屈膝蹲着，两条腿大大地打开，做出一个柔道的预备姿势。他左手伸直，握住那只在月光下闪着银光的弓，右手握着第二只箭的箭羽，僵直的摆在右颊旁边。紧绷的右肘高高抬起，放在头后。那第二只银色的箭正对着的，正好是缓缓站起的两个苍白的身影的正中间。

邦德赶紧小声说：“别动。”然后又大喊：“你好，‘得力’，好箭法啊！”

“得力”将箭头向上抬起指向天空。

邦德站起身，挡在女郎身前。他从嘴角轻声挤出几个字：“他肯定没看见枪。”然后又用平和随意的语气对“得力”说：“金手指先生这个地方不错啊，有时间想跟他聊一聊。今晚有点晚了，就算了。你转告他吧，我可能明天来找他。”邦德转身对女郎说：“走吧，亲爱的。你要在林子里散步，咱们也散了，该回酒店了。”他朝篱笆方向走了一步。

“得力”将前面那只脚向前踏出一步。第二只箭的箭头指向了邦德的肚子正中。

“阿（那）边。”“得力”把头向侧面偏了偏，指了指坡下的房子。

“哦，你觉得他愿意现在就见我们吗？好吧。你不觉得我们这样会打扰他吗？走吧，亲爱的。”

邦德带头向树的左边走去，离开了扔在草丛里的来复枪。

他们缓缓向坡下走去的时候，邦德小声向女郎交代着：“你是我女朋友。我从英国带你来到这儿。你因为我们这次小冒险旅行有点兴奋。我们现在处境很艰难，别做任何傻事。”邦德用头向后指了指，“那人是个杀手。”

女郎生气地说：“要不是你插手我早解决了。”

“我也想说这话呢。”邦德简明扼要地说，但他马上又后悔了，“对不起，蒂莉。我没别的意思，但是我觉得你就算得手了也跑不了。”

“我都计划好了，我午夜时分就能到达边境。”

邦德没有说话，有一样东西吸引了他的目光。在那高高的烟囱顶上，那雷达一样的东西又开始旋转了。就是那个东西发现了他们——确切地说是听到了他们的动静。这肯定是某种声呐探测器。这个人花招可是真不少！邦德本没有低估金手指的意思，但是不是自己真的低估了他呢？或许，如果自己带了枪……不行，邦德知道，即使自己射击精准也不可能击败那个韩国人……现在自己更不能发起攻击了。这人真是一个劲敌，不管自己是否带了武器，两人的实力差距都太悬殊了。

他们一走到院子里，房子的后门就打开了。另外两个韩国人——也许就是在雷古弗的那两个仆人——穿过电灯发出的暖暖的光线向他们跑过来，手里都拿着丑陋的棍棒。“停！”这两个人脸上都带着野蛮而空洞的狞笑，那表情像极了那些来自J站，坐过日本人监狱的人的表情。“我们搜查。没事还好，否则……”说话的人猛地向空中甩动了一下手中的棍棒，“举起手来。”

邦德慢慢举起了手。他对女郎说：“不管他们做什么都不要动。”

“得力”走上前来，站在一边看着搜查的过程，表情险恶。搜查很专业。邦德冷冷地看着那双手在女郎身上摸索着，那些人脸上露出了邪恶的笑容。

“好了，进来吧！”

一群人涌入门中，顺着一条狭窄的通道走到房子的前门。房子散发出来的气味跟邦德之前想象的一样，发霉的气味混合着夏日阳光的气味。房子的几扇门上都安着白色的门板。“得力”走过去，在其中的一扇门上敲了敲。

“谁？”

“得力”推开门，他们一帮人走进了屋子。

金手指正坐在一张大桌子后面，桌子上整齐地堆放着一些看似很重要的文件。

桌子两侧是几个灰色的金属文件柜。桌子旁边，就在金手指触手可及的地方，一个矮桌上放着一台短波的无线电台。旁边是一个操作键盘和一个快速运转的机器，看样子像是个气压计。邦德猜想这些设备肯定属于捕获了他们的探测器的一部分。

金手指身穿紫罗兰色的便服，内衬一件白色丝质的敞领衬衫。

衬衣敞开的领口露出了一簇橘红色的胸毛。他坐在一把高背椅上，身子挺得直直的。他几乎没有看那女郎一眼。他那双浅蓝色的眼睛一直盯在邦德身上。眼神里丝毫看不到一丝的惊奇，只有穿透骨髓的冷酷。

邦德大吼一声：“金手指，这是他妈的怎么回事？我赢了你一万美元，你就把警察招到我身边，我跟我的女朋友索姆斯小姐跟踪你到了这里。我就是想问问你那到底是怎么回事。我们是翻越了栏杆，我也知道这算是擅自闯入，但是我这么做是希望在你走之前找到你。而你们的人来了，差点没用他的弓箭射死我们。你的另两个韩国人更是把我们抓起来，搜查全身。这他妈的到底怎么回事？今天你要是不给我解释清楚并跟我道歉，我就报警。”

金手指那单调而强势的眼神始终没有改变，他也许根本没有听出邦德语气中的愤怒——绅士发脾气就是这么含蓄。终于，他那线条分明的嘴唇张开了，说：“邦德先生，芝加哥人有一句老话：‘一次是意外，两次是巧合，如果有三次，肯定就是蓄意为敌。’迈阿密，桑德威奇，现在又是日内瓦。我必须揭开你的假面具，看看你的真实身份了。”金手指的目光慢慢转向邦德头后。

“‘得力’，审讯室。”





第三部　蓄意为敌





第十五章　审讯室


邦德几乎是出于本能地做出了反应。他没有经过计划和思考，向前迈出了一步，身子一跃而起，直冲向桌子对面的金手指。他的身体在桌子上方轻轻下沉，他顺势在桌子上踩了一脚，身子从那堆文件中穿了过去。紧接着，他的头部“砰”的一声撞到了金手指的胸骨上。金手指坐在椅子中的身子晃了一下。椅子受到这冲击的力量向后倒去，两个人的身体也随之掉落到椅子的碎片里。就在即将落地的那一刹那，邦德的一只手的手指扼住了金手指的喉咙用尽全力捏了下去。

这时，整个房子好像都朝邦德压了过来，一根木棍砸在他的后颈上，他慢吞吞地从金手指身上滚下来，躺在地板上，不动了。

一团光线像漩涡一样在邦德眼前旋转，慢慢转成了一个圆盘的样子，又像是一轮黄黄的满月，最后又变得像一只巨人的眼球。在那团火焰一样的眼球上，仿佛写着些什么字，好像是上天传递给邦德的一个重要信息，他一定要看清楚。于是邦德仔细地一个一个将那些微小的字母拼了出来。那行小字写的是：马自达有限责任公司。这字有什么意义？一盆水猛地泼到邦德的脸上，灌了他满眼满嘴。他拼命干呕着，奋力挣扎，然而却一动也不能动。

现在他的脑子恢复了清醒，眼前也重新清晰起来。他的后颈阵阵作痛，眼前是一个大大的灯泡，正发出刺眼的强光。他好像是躺在一个桌子一样的东西上，手腕脚腕都被绑在了那个东西的边缘上。他用手指摸索着，那东西是金属的。

一个声音传来，是金手指操着他那单调而又冷漠的嗓音说：“现在我们可以开始了。”

邦德朝那个声音转过头去。因为眼前的强光，他感到有点眩晕。他用力闭了闭眼，又重新睁开。金手指正坐在一把帆布椅子上，已经脱掉了外衣，只穿着那件白衬衫。他的脖子根部还能看见红色的手指印。在他身旁的折叠桌上，放着各种各样的工具和金属器具，还有一个控制面板。在桌子的另一边，蒂莉·玛斯特顿坐在一张椅子上，手脚都被绑在椅子上。她身子挺得直直的，像个小学生一样。她看上去美得不可思议，但是又好像吓坏了。她双目无神地盯着邦德，看样子不是被灌了药就是被催眠了。

邦德将头向右转过去。那个韩国人就在几英尺以外的地方站着，仍然戴着那顶帽子，但是上身的衣服却脱掉了，汗水在那黄皮肤的宽大身躯上反射着灯光，胸口没有一根汗毛。两块胸肌像盘子一样宽大，胃的部位是凹陷进去的，与上面那高高鼓起的肋骨形成了鲜明的对比。大臂和前臂上同样没有汗毛，却像大腿一样粗细。那双眼睛眼角上吊，看起来乌黑油亮，眼神兴奋而又贪婪。他的嘴巴咧开笑着，露出了满口浅黑色的牙齿。

邦德抬起头。忍着痛向四周看了一眼。他们现在是在那些车间的其中一间。两座电熔炉的铁门在白光的照射下闪闪发亮。几个木质箱子里堆着一些浅蓝色的金属。不知道从哪儿传来了发电机运转发出的“呼呼”声。一种低沉的捶打声从远处传来，在这声音之后，又听到了发电机传来的“砰砰”声。

邦德努力将身子抬起一点，低头看了看自己身下的那个桌子。然后又伴随着一声叹息躺了回去。那光亮的金属桌子中间有一条细细的缝隙。在那道缝隙的一头，一把圆形锯子的锯齿闪着寒光，瞄准了他分开的两腿之间的位置。

邦德躺平身体，眼睛盯着灯泡上的那行小字。这时，金手指又开口了，语气显得随意而放松。邦德赶紧中止了他那西洋景一样的想象，认真听了起来。

“邦德先生，‘痛’这个字来源于拉丁语，意思是‘惩罚’，就是说一个人必须欠债还钱。你刚才攻击我恰恰证明了我之前的设想是正确的，你对我的好奇心肯定动机不纯，你必须要因此付出代价。一句老话说得好，‘好奇害死猫。’今天，你的好奇心恐怕得害死两只猫了，那个女郎我想也应该是与我为敌的吧。据她自己的说法，她就住在贝格斯。但是我只用了一通电话就证明这是胡编乱造的。‘得力’回到了你们刚才的藏身之处，发现了她的来复枪，除此之外，还有一枚戒指，而我刚好认识这枚戒指。我只用了催眠这一招，一切就都迎刃而解了。她到这儿来的目的就是杀我，可能你的目的跟她一样吧，可是你们俩人都失败了。现在，是你付出代价的时候了，邦德先生。”金手指的嗓音透出一丝厌倦和无聊，“我一生中有很多敌人。我事业成功，非常有钱。我不妨将我的另一句格言送给你吧：金钱可能无法给你带来更多的朋友，但是绝对可以让你有更多更强的敌人。”

“精辟啊！”

金手指没有理会邦德：“如果你有的是时间和自由，你可以走遍世界各地去探查一下，那些希望我生病，想方设法要挫败我的人遍布世界各个角落。邦德先生，这样的人为数不少，就像夏天挤在路面上的刺猬一样到处都是。”

“比喻打得挺有诗意。”

“呵呵，邦德先生，其实碰巧我也称得上是一位实际行动上的诗人——虽然我很少用文字写诗。我很注意将自己的行为安排得合理而又有效，但这不是我想说的主题。我只是想让你明白，那天你第一次闯入我的生活，扰乱了我的计划，虽然对我来说影响不大，但是那天注定是你厄运的开始。那次是有人代你受过了。你很幸运，如果你有机会聆听神谕的话，你会听到这样的忠告：‘邦德先生，你之前是够幸运的。离奥瑞克·金手指先生远一点。这个人能力无边，如果他想灭了你，他做着梦翻翻身就搞定了。’”

“你对自己的描述真够形象的。”邦德朝金手指转过头来。那颗棕红色的足球一样的脑袋正微微向前伸着，那张满月一般的脸上没有任何表情。

一只手好像漫不经心似的伸向了控制面板，按下了一个按钮。从邦德躺着的桌子一头传来了金属发出的轰隆轰隆的声音。这声音的频率迅速提高，很快变成了一种尖锐的声音，频率高得几乎超出了人类的听力范围。邦德不耐烦地将头转到一边。这个死亡的过程得持续多长时间？他有没有什么办法能求得速死呢？他有一个朋友曾经饱受盖世太保的折磨却幸存了下来。他向邦德描述了当时他甚至想通过憋气自杀。通过超人的意志力，憋气几分钟的时间后，人就会失去意识。但是一旦失去了意识，人的意志力和意向也就随之离开了身体。之前憋气的目的被遗忘。呼吸受到生存本能的操控，自然就又恢复了。但是邦德还是可以尝试一下这种方法的。反正在死亡到来之前也没有什么别的做法可以帮他熬过痛苦了。生命的结束是唯一的解脱。他知道，自己永远不可能在金手指面前高声尖叫，那将让他颜面扫地——告诉金手指事实，求他饶了自己的性命好像也行不通。不行，他必须坚持自己之前的说法，但愿自己的继任者运气能更好一些吧。M会选择谁来继续执行任务呢？很可能是008，三人杀手团中的第二号人物。他是个好人选，比邦德要更细心。M知道金手指杀了邦德之后，肯定会授予008随时杀死金手指给邦德报仇的权力。日内瓦的258号特工会将邦德向他询问奥瑞克公司情况的事情向总部汇报。没错，如果邦德守口如瓶的话，金手指自会受到命运的严惩。一旦他走漏了半点风声，金手指就一定会逃脱，后果将不堪设想。

“那好，邦德先生，”金手指的语气显得出奇轻快，“和蔼可亲到此为止吧。唱歌吧，就像我那位芝加哥的朋友说的，唱歌能让你的死亡过程迅速而没有痛苦。还有那个女郎，你要是不唱，那伴随你死亡的可就是一声长长的尖叫了。那个女郎我就赏给‘得力’了，就像那只猫一样，赏给他当晚餐吧。怎么样，你唱还是不唱？”

邦德说：“别傻了，金手指。我来之前跟我在环球出口公司的朋友说了我要到哪里去，目的是什么。而且，那个女郎的父母也知道她跟我来这儿了。我们来这儿之前特意咨询了关于你们这个工厂的情况。他们很容易就能找到这儿。环球公司是很有势力的。我们失踪后用不了几天警察就会找上门来。咱们做个交易吧。你放我们走，这里的事儿我对谁都不会提起。我也想为那个女郎担保，你真是大错而特错了，我们俩绝对都是好人。”

金手指有点厌烦地说：“恐怕你还是不明白，邦德先生。不管你了解了我的什么秘密，我估计你也了解不了什么，那也只是真实情况的一小部分，我的后台很硬。让你们俩当中的任何一个活着走出这个大门都是荒唐的做法，这是没有任何疑问的。如果警察来了，我也会热烈欢迎的。但是我手下那些韩国人可不会这样，还有那几口电熔炉，里面两千摄氏度的高温会将你们的尸体和携带的物品气化，消失得无影无踪。不要这样，邦德先生，做个正确的选择吧。或许你需要我鼓励你一下。”桌子那头传来了带动锯齿的杠杆慢慢移动的声音。“现在钢锯以每分钟一英寸的速度向你的身体靠近。同时，”他看了‘得力’一眼，伸出了一根手指，“让‘得力’给你来点提示。先从一级开始，你感受一下，可能二级和三级会更有说服力。”

邦德闭上了眼睛。“得力”身上那种令人作呕的动物园的气味瞬间笼罩了过来。那巨大粗糙的手指将力量准确地施加到他的身上。在这儿按一下，在那儿按一下，突然的一压，停顿一下，然后又是一下快而重的击打。不管是哪种动作，这双粗壮的大手都做得极其精准。邦德咬紧牙关，牙齿几乎都快碎了。

邦德双目紧闭，眼窝里积攒了一小洼因为疼痛而流出的汗水。现在，钢锯旋转发出的尖锐的声音显得越来越响了。这声音让邦德回忆起了很久以前夏日的夜晚在英国的家里的那种木屑味儿。家？这就是他的家，他自己选择了这种在危险中求生存的生活方式，就应该以此为家。而如今，他就要葬身于这异国的熔炉的角落里，永远忍受着两千摄氏度的煎烤。上帝保佑你，亲爱的特工先生！他该给自己选一个什么样的墓志铭呢？他最后的豪言壮语应该是什么呢？就说“你无权选择如何出生，却能选择如何死去”？嗯，这句话写在墓碑上比较好看——生得糊涂，死得明白。

“邦德先生，”金手指的语气显得有些急迫了，“真的有必要这样吗？你就说了实话吧。你是什么人？谁派你来的？你都知道了什么？然后一切就简单了：我会给你们每人一颗药，不会有任何痛苦的，就跟喝了安眠药一样。否则可就麻烦了——既麻烦又痛苦。而且，你觉得你这么做对那女郎公平吗？这是一名英国绅士该有的行为吗？”

“得力”执行的酷刑暂时停止了。邦德朝声音传来的方向缓缓转过头去，睁开了眼睛。他说：“金手指，我没什么可说的，因为本来就没什么事。如果你不接受我刚才提出的条件，那我就再提一个。我跟那个女郎都将效力于你。怎么样？我们俩都很能干。你可以对我们委以重任。”

“在我背上插一把刀，不，应该是两把刀？多谢，不用了，邦德先生。”

邦德觉得此时不应该再说话了。他觉得他应该上紧意志的发条，在死之前不要再松懈下来了。邦德礼貌地说：“那么你可以离开了。”他将空气从肺部排除，闭上了眼睛。

“即便是我也做不到的，邦德先生。”金手指幽默地说，“好吧，天堂有路你不走，地狱无门自来投，那我也要竭尽所能让这条地狱之路荆棘遍布。‘得力’，二级！”

这时，桌子上的杠杆又向前移动了一英寸。邦德已经能感觉到那旋转的钢锯已经在他的双膝之间了。“得力”那双手又伸了过来。

那缓慢跳动的脉搏彻底占据了他身体，每跳一下，邦德心中都默默地数一下。这种跳动跟工厂另一间车间里正在喷气的发电机有点类似。不同的是，他的心脏跳动正在慢慢地减速。如果减速能再快点就好了。大脑明明发出了死亡的指令，意识却还想继续生存，这是多么荒谬的事？就好像油箱明明空了，机器还要继续运转一样。但是此时，他必须要将所有思想都从大脑中清空，同时将所有氧气从肺部清空。他必须让自己的身体成为真空状态，让它彻底失去意识。

灯光照射在他紧闭的眼皮上，他眼前依然是一片红色。他依然能够感觉到太阳穴那里的巨大压力，生命的节奏也依然在他的耳边敲响着。

一声尖叫企图冲破紧要的牙关。

去死吧！你去死吧！你去死吧你死吧死吧……





第十六章　最后也是最大的一次机会


鸽子翅膀、天堂里的唱诗班、天使之歌——关于天堂他还有什么印象？现在的感觉跟他在儿童时期听到的传言是一样的——飞翔的感觉、黑暗、千百万架竖琴齐鸣。他一定要记住这个地方给他带来的兴奋的感觉。现在我们看吧，自己来到了天国的门前……

一个低沉而慈爱的声音在他耳边说：“我是本次航班的机长。”（呃，呃，这是谁呢？圣人彼得吗？）“我们马上就要降落了。请系好您的安全带，并熄灭香烟。谢谢。”

肯定不止他一个，大家肯定是组了个团一起上天堂的。蒂莉是不是也在这个团里呢？邦德因为尴尬而局促不安了起来。他该怎么向别人介绍她呢？比如向维斯伯？如果到了做出选择的时候，他最喜欢的是谁呢？但也许那里是个很大的地方，也分很多的国家和城市。他在那边碰上前女友的概率应该也不大吧。但是他在那边定居下来之前有些人还是有意避开一些的好。或许，他付出了这么多的爱，这些事情也就无关紧要了吧。也许一个人就是会爱上他遇到的所有女郎呢。嗯，这问题还挺棘手。

伴随着脑子里这些乱七八糟的想法，邦德慢慢堕入了无意识状态。

不知什么时候，他感觉到了自己的身体在轻轻地摆动着。他睁了睁眼。明亮的阳光照得他什么都看不见。于是他又把眼睛闭上了。他听到自己的头顶上方有人在说话：“注意点儿，哥们儿。这斜坡比看起来还要陡。”话音未落他就感觉到了剧烈的颠簸。一个粗暴无礼的声音从前面传来：“天哪！这还用你说！他们就不能铺上点儿橡胶吗？”

邦德有点生气地想，天堂里的人们就是这么说话的啊。就因为我是新人，他们觉得根本不用在意我的存在吗？突然传来“砰”的一声关门的声音。什么东西打在邦德伸出的胳膊肘上。

他喊了一声：“嘿！”然后想要够到胳膊肘揉一揉，但是他的手却一动也动不了。

“你知道什么。嘿，山姆，最好找个医生来。这家伙醒了。”

“好的！来，把他放到另一个旁边。”邦德感觉自己被放下了。现在感觉凉爽多了。他又睁开了眼睛。一张又大又圆，具有布鲁克林特征的脸朝他凑了过来，那双眼睛正好对上了邦德的眼神，笑了。担架的金属支架已经触地了。那人说：“你感觉怎么样，先生？”

“我这是在哪儿？”邦德的声音显得有点慌乱。他试着坐起来，但是没有成功。他感觉到自己后背上冒出了一层冷汗。上帝啊？难道他现在还活着？一产生这个念头，一阵悲伤像电流一样立刻贯穿了他的全身。泪水充盈了他的眼眶，顺着脸颊流淌下来。

“嘿！嘿！别这样，先生。你没事儿。这里是艾德怀尔德，纽约，你现在在美国。你看，已经没有危险了。”那个人站直了身子，他以为邦德是来自什么地方的难民呢，“山姆，快过来，这个人吓坏了。”

“好了，好了。”两个人紧张地交谈着，声音越来越远。

邦德感觉自己的头能动了。他向旁边转过头去。发现他躺在一间四面都是白墙的病房里——看起来很像是机场的医务室。房间里摆放着一排干净整洁的病床。阳光从高大的窗户倾泻进来，但是屋里很凉爽，应该是开了空调。他正躺在地上的一个担架上。旁边还摆了另一个担架。他用尽全力扭头看过去，是蒂莉。她还处于昏迷状态，脸朝上躺着，脸色在黑色头发的映衬下显得更加苍白了。

病房一头的门“吱”的一声打开了。一个穿白大褂的医生站在门口将门扶住。金手指一副轻松愉快的样子，迈着轻快的脚步穿过病床之间的空隙走了过来，“得力”跟在他的身后。邦德厌烦地闭上了双眼。上帝啊，自己原来还没有逃出他的手掌心。

几双脚瞬间围到了邦德躺着的担架旁边。金手指又用那轻松愉快的语气说：“嗯，他们看起来状态还不错，是吧，医生？这就是有钱的好处。当你的朋友或是属下有病了，你就可以给他们提供最好的医疗条件。神经过分紧张崩溃了，两个人都是这样。而且是在同一周内！您能相信吗？但是我想这全是我的错，给他们的工作压力太大了。所以我得负责把他们治好。福熙医生——日内瓦最好的医生——也证实了这一点。他说‘他们需要休息，金手指先生。休息休息再休息。’医生给他们打了镇静剂，现在要把他们送到长老会医院去。”他咯咯笑了两声，继续说：“耕耘自有收获，对吧，医生？当时我把那些价值几百万美元的X光设备捐给长老会医院的时候本没有期望得到什么回报。但是现在呢？我只需要打个电话，医院就会给他们两个准备好两间最好的病房。好吧，”邦德听到了写字发出的瑟瑟声，“非常感谢您在移民局对我们提供的帮助。幸亏他们都有有效的签证，我想移民局也一定会很满意的，毕竟有我奥瑞克·金手指先生给他们做担保，他们绝不会用暴力手段对美国政府构成威胁的。对吧？”

“对，您说的没错。非常感谢您，金手指先生。您还有什么需要我做的吗？……我知道，您的私人救护车已经在外面等候了。”

邦德睁开了眼睛，想看看医生的声音是从哪里传来的。他看到一个带着无边眼睛，留着平头的年轻男人，表情和蔼而又认真。邦德费力地开口说话了，声音很小但是语气很真诚：“医生，我跟这个女郎身体都没有任何问题。我们是被灌了药强行带到这里的。我们两个都不是金手指的属下，不管是现在还是以前。我提醒您，我们是被绑架了。我要求见移民局的长官。我在华盛顿和纽约都有朋友，他们都能为我作担保。我求求您一定要相信我。”邦德注视着那个医生的双眼，期望他能相信自己。

医生的表情看起来非常担心，他朝金手指转过身去。金手指摇了摇头——动作很小，免得邦德的自尊心受到伤害。一只手鬼鬼祟祟地伸了出来，挡在了医生和邦德的脸之间。金手指无奈地扬了扬眉毛：“您知道我的意思了吧，医生？像这样的情况已经有好几天了。完全是神经极度疲劳外加被害妄想症。福熙医生说这两种情况确实很容易一起出现。估计他们得在长老会医院住上几个星期了。但是我一定会竭尽所能让他康复的。可能是这儿陌生的环境让他太紧张了。是不是每隔一段时间给他打上一支氯化钠呢……”

医生朝他那黑色的手提箱弯下腰去：“既然是要转到长老会医院进行治疗，我想您的提议是对的，金手指先生。”然后传来了医疗器械撞击发出的声音。

金手指又说：“看到一个人彻底的垮掉真是让人伤心，他可曾经是我最得力的助手呢。”他弯下腰，朝邦德露出了慈爱而温柔的笑容。他的话里似乎饱含深意：“你会好起来的，詹姆斯。我还担心你的身体坐飞机承受不住呢。你只要放松下来好好休息，剩下的事都交给我来办吧。”

邦德感觉到一根棉签在他胳膊上擦了擦。他用力地喘息着，自己都控制不住冲动，一连串的诅咒谩骂脱口而出。然后，他感觉到针头扎进了自己的皮肤，他张开嘴，用力地叫喊着，直到那位医生在他身边跪了下来，轻轻地、耐心地为他擦拭额头上的汗水。

再醒过来的时候，他已经躺在了一间灰色的房间里，那房间就像一个大箱子，连一扇窗户都没有。只有屋顶正中的一盏灯发出了一些光线。电灯周围那灰色的屋顶上有一些裂痕，屋子里没有什么特别的气味，似乎能听到空调发出的一点儿微弱的嗡嗡声。邦德发现自己能坐起来了。坐起来后，他感觉有点昏昏欲睡，但是状态还好。他突然觉得又饿又渴，不知道自己上次吃饭是在什么时候了。两天以前，还是三天以前？他将双脚垂下放到地上，发现自己竟然全身赤裸。他检查了一下自己的身体。“得力”手法相当细致，除了前臂上的针孔，他身上根本找不到任何受过伤害的痕迹。他强忍眩晕站起身来，费力地在房间里走了几步。他发现自己原来躺在一个类似船舱里的铺位的地方，下面还有一个抽屉。房间里唯一的家具是一张简单的办公桌和一把木质椅子。房间里的东西干净而实用。邦德走到铺位旁边单膝跪了下去，打开了下面的抽屉。除了他的手表和手枪外，他行李箱里的东西都在里面。就连他去探查奥瑞克公司的时候穿的那双沉重的鞋子也在里面。他将其中一只鞋的鞋跟拧了一下，向外一拉。一把双刃刀从藏在鞋底的刀鞘中倏地滑了出来。邦德用手握住鞋跟，手中立刻出现了一把精工细作的锋利匕首。邦德检查了一下藏在另一只鞋子里的匕首，然后将抽出的这支重新插了回去。他从抽屉里拿出几件衣服，穿在身上。他又找出了香烟和打火机，点上了一支。房间的墙壁上有两扇门，其中一扇上带有把手。他将有把手的那扇打开了。门口后通向一间浴室兼厕所，设备完善。他的洗漱用品整整齐齐地摆放在那里，并且旁边还有一套女士用品。邦德轻轻打开通往浴室的另一扇门。那边是一间跟他的房间很相似的房间，映入眼帘的正是铺位的枕头上蒂莉·玛斯特顿那头乌黑的秀发。邦德蹑手蹑脚地走到她身边，低头看了看。她正在安安静静地睡着，美丽的嘴唇似笑非笑。邦德又回到了浴室，轻轻地把门关上，走到洗手盆的镜子前，看着镜中的自己。从黑黑的胡茬看，应该已经过去三天了。他开始动手将自己身上收拾干净。

半小时后，邦德收拾停当，坐在铺位上开始思考起来。突然那扇没有把手的门打开了，“得力”站在了门口。他对邦德似乎一点都不关心，而是仔细观察着房间的每一个角落。邦德厉声说：“‘得力’，我想吃饭，快点儿。我要一瓶波旁威士忌，苏打水加冰。还要一盒切斯特菲尔德香烟，要大盒的。还有，要么把我的手表还给我，要么就给我弄块新的，要跟我原来那块一样好才行。快去！动作麻利点儿！告诉金手指我要见他，但是得先吃完饭。快点儿！别磨蹭了！别在那儿傻站着了。我饿疯了！”

“得力”盯着邦德，气得面红耳赤，好像在想该打断邦德的哪句话合适。他张开嘴发出了一个声音，说不清楚是在发怒还是抱怨，朝自己的脚边愤愤地吐了口口水，退出去了。弹簧门迅速回旋，在本该发出“砰”的一声的那一刻，那扇门却突然减速，伴随着轻柔干脆的“咔嗒”的两声，关上了。

这次会面让邦德觉得有些好笑。不知道为什么，金手指改变了杀掉他们的念头。他想留下他们的性命。很快邦德就能了解金手指为什么不想让他们死了。但是，邦德希望能按自己的方式活下来。这过程包括让“得力”和其他的几个韩国人认识到自己的身份。在邦德看来，这些人在哺乳动物的等级层次中甚至比大猩猩都低。

不一会儿，一个韩国仆人将一桌丰盛的饭菜送了过来，同时送来的还有邦德要求的其他一些东西，包括他的手表在内。除了他所在的地方应该离水很近，不远处应该有一座铁路桥之外，邦德对他的处境依然没有更多的了解。邦德猜想他现在的位置应该是在纽约，可能是在哈德逊河上，也许是在东河上。从声音判断这旁边应该是有一条电力火车的火车道，听声音又有点像地铁，但是邦德对纽约的地理情况并不是十分了解，因此也就无从定位。他的手表已经不走了。他询问了一下时间，但是没有得到答案。

邦德吃完了托盘里所有的食物，点了一支烟，喝了几口波旁威士忌和苏打水。这时，门开了，金手指独自走了进来。他一身商人的打扮，看起来轻松自在，心情大好。他将身后的门关好，背对门站在那里。他疑惑地打量着邦德，邦德吸了一口烟，也礼貌地看了他一眼。

金手指说：“早上好，邦德先生。我看你恢复得不错了。我想相比死掉，你还是比较喜欢现在的处境吧？我想就不麻烦你开口问了，我来直接告诉你一切吧。之后我有一个提议，你必须给予明确的答复。你是个聪明绝顶的人，所以我只需要小小地警告你一下就可以了。不要激动，不要用刀叉或是酒瓶攻击我。如果你有任何轻举妄动，我就用这个射击了。”一只小口径手枪的枪口从他右手的拳头里伸出来，像一根黑色的拇指。他把手枪重新放回口袋里。“我很少用这东西。但是我被逼无奈的时候，一颗25口径子弹也足够我用来杀死我的对手了。我习惯瞄准目标的左眼，邦德先生。而且，我从没失手过。”

邦德说：“不用担心，我要是拿威士忌酒瓶当武器的话，肯定没您瞄得准。”他用力将裤腿向上拉了拉，将一条腿搭在另一条上面，摆出一副轻松的坐姿，“说吧！”

“邦德先生，”金手指和蔼可亲地说，“我对很多事情都在行，尤其是金属。我特别欣赏那些纯度高的东西，我的意思是纯金。跟金子的价值以及纯度相比，别的东西根本没法相提并论。虽然如此，有时候，这些东西也能为人所用。‘得力’就是个例子——简单而未经雕琢，但是他有限的价值可以对我非常有用。我之所以在最后时刻决定留下你的性命是因为我在你身上发现了一些非常坚毅的品质，我想可以将之为我所用。也许这不是个正确的决定。但是，任何时候我都会尽力避免由于冲动给自己带来的任何危险。实际上是你说的一句话救了自己的性命，你说你和玛斯特顿小姐都可以为我效力。本来我是用不到你们两个这样的人的。但是碰巧我刚刚涉足一项事业，你们两个刚好能协助我。所以我决定赌一赌。我给你们都注射了镇静剂。我派人去贝格斯找到了你们入住的酒店，帮你们结了账，取回了你们的行李。我以你的名义给环球出口公司发了电报，告诉他们你去加拿大发展了。你要乘飞机去考察考察，玛斯特顿小姐就当你的秘书。你需要再发一份更加详细的电报，可以写得生硬蹩脚，但是在我需要你帮忙的短短的一段时间内它会发挥作用。（邦德心想，怎么会呢？你就是在电报里直接写上“这是真的”也没用。现在组织肯定已经知道我被敌人控制了，他们肯定已经加紧行动了。）而且，邦德先生，如果你认为我的准备还不够充分，你的人能追踪到你的行迹，那么你就大错而特错了。告诉你吧，对于你的真实身份以及你上司的势力和背景我一点儿都不关心。你和玛斯特顿小姐即将彻底的消失踪迹，邦德先生。我和我的人也是一样。机场方面晚些时候会向长老会医院询问，医院方面反馈的情况会是他们从来没见过金手指先生和他送来的病人。联邦调查局和中央情报局也查不到任何关于我的记录，因为我没有前科。当然了，移民局那边可以查到我这几年来往的详细记录，但是这些信息没有任何意义。关于咱们现在的行踪，邦德先生，这里是高速运输公司的一个仓库，这是我从前经营过的一家公司，现在已经发展成了我说的那家公司的秘密总部。你跟玛斯特顿小姐就在这里活动，可以在这儿正常生活工作，甚至如果有可能的话，也可以做爱——虽然我看玛斯特顿小姐不见得乐意。”

“那我们的工作职责是什么？”

“邦德先生——”自从邦德认识金手指以来，这好像还是第一次在那张面无表情、无动于衷的脸上看到了如此生动的神色。那双眼睛里闪着的几乎是欣喜若狂的目光。那轮廓分明的嘴唇微微噘起。“邦德先生，我的一生都深陷爱情不能自拔，而我迷恋的对象就是黄金。我爱它的颜色、它的光彩、它那沉甸甸的手感。我爱黄金的质地，那柔软顺滑的触感，我只要一摸就可以判断出每根金条的纯度，误差不超过1K。我也爱金子融化成金水时释放出来的热量。但是，我最爱的，邦德先生，还是黄金给它的拥有者带来的力量——那能够控制能量、驱使劳动、实现每一个愿望和心血来潮的念头的魔力，并且在必要的时候，它还能收买生命、思想，甚至灵魂。是的，邦德先生，我用了毕生的精力在追求黄金，反过来，黄金也服务于我以及我赞助的那些公司。我来问你，”金手指热切地看着邦德，“在这个世界上，还有什么别的东西能够像黄金一样懂得回报主人吗？”

“很多人没有黄金，但是他们也能变得富有，也能手握重权。但是我明白您的意思了。那您一共收集了多少黄金，又是怎么支配的？”

“我现在拥有的黄金大概价值两千万英镑，可谓富可敌国了。现在这些黄金都在纽约。我把它们存放在它们能派上用场的地方。我的黄金储备就像一堆肥料，我把它们从一个地方挪到另一个地方，无论我决定把它们播撒到什么地方，那个地方都会开花结果。我收获之后就转移战场。最近，我刚好想要用我的黄金肥料对一家美国的机构给予鼓励或者说是施以压力。因此，我的金条现在都聚集在纽约了。”

“您根据什么来选择投资的公司？您看重的是什么特质？”

“我只赞助那些有助于增加我的黄金储备的公司。我投资，我走私，我窃取。”金手指将手掌摊开，“我来打个比方：历史就好比是穿越时间的一辆高速列车，鸟儿和动物们受到列车噪音的惊扰，或者慌乱飞走，或者因为害怕而退缩着试图躲避，而我就像一只雄鹰，我会选择跟着那列火车——注意的话你能够经常看到这样的场景，比如在希腊——一旦由于这列火车的惊扰有什么小动物逃了出来，这只雄鹰立刻就会扑上去。举个简单的例子：历史的车轮催生了盘尼西林的发明。几乎就在同时，历史也促使了一次世界大战的爆发。很多人濒临死亡，很多人害怕死亡，盘尼西林正好能救他们的命。我通过贿赂欧洲大陆的某些军事当权派，得到了一些盘尼西林。之后我小小地加工了一下，在里面添加了点儿无害的粉末或是液体，然后卖给那些急需的人，获取了高额的利润。你明白我的意思了吧，邦德先生？你需要做的只是耐心等待猎物出现，用心捕捉恰当的时机，然后扑下去。但是，正如我刚才所说的，我不会去刻意寻找那些机会，只是等着历史的列车驱使着它们呈现在我的眼前。”

“那最近的这次是什么机会？我跟玛斯特顿小姐跟这又有什么关系？”

“最近的一次，邦德先生，是最后一次。也是最大的一次机会。”金手指的眼睛此时失去了刚才的神采，似乎陷入了沉思。他的声音变得低沉下来，语气里饱含尊敬。“人类爬上过珠穆朗玛峰，也下到过海底，将火箭发射到外太空，也引爆过原子弹。在每一个领域，人类都在竭尽所能地发明着、创造着、进取着，不断地取得胜利、打破纪录、创造奇迹。我刚才说是每一个领域，但是其实有一个领域被忽略了，邦德先生。我指的是被人们随随便便称为‘犯罪’的那个领域。我指的当然不是那些愚蠢的战争，对彼此的攻击、毁灭，我指的是所谓的个人犯罪行为：比如抢银行、诈骗、造假这些小技巧。而现在，在离这儿几百英里以外的一个地方，一个有史以来最大的犯罪机会就摆在我们面前，简直是唾手可得。戏台搭好了，丰厚的战利品也摆了出来。现在唯一差的就是演员了。现在，制片人终于出山了，邦德先生，”金手指伸出一根手指在自己的胸前点了两下，“他选好了演员。今天下午剧本就会送到主角的手上。彩排随后马上开始，一星期以后，幕布拉开，好戏即将上演。然后，热烈的掌声将要献给有史以来最伟大的超越法度的妙计。而且，邦德先生，这掌声估计能够惊扰整个世界长达几百年之久。”

说到这儿，金手指那原本苍白的眼睛里似乎燃起了一团火焰，那棕红色的脸上也泛起了一丝红晕，但他脸上的表情依然是镇静、放松、坚定无比。

邦德想，从表面还真看不出这人的疯狂和空想。金手指脑子里有一些不切实际的想法，但是他对这怪诞的想法做了评估，知道这些想法是正确的。邦德说：“好了，快说吧，我们究竟要干什么？”

“抢劫，邦德先生。这是一场没有对手的抢劫，但是需要缜密的计划。很多文书工作需要做，很多管理方面的细节做法需要监督。我本来打算全部自己承担的，但是后来你主动要求为我效力。好吧，那么现在就由你来做，玛斯特顿小姐来协助你。我也不会让你们白干，事成之后，你将获得价值一百万英镑的黄金作为酬劳；玛斯特顿小姐的是五十万英镑。”

邦德满怀热情地说：“这才像话。我们具体做什么？到彩虹尽头找金矿吗？(1)”

“没错，”金手指点了点头，“这就是我们的任务。我们要去窃取价值一百五十亿美元的黄金，大概相当于全世界所有金矿产量的一半。邦德先生，我们要去攻占诺克斯堡。”

第十七章　混混代表大会


“诺克斯堡。”邦德严肃地摇了摇头，“这对于两个男人一个女人的队伍来说是个不可实现的目标，不是吗？”

金手指不耐烦地耸了耸肩：“邦德先生，请把你的幽默感暂时收敛一下吧。一个星期之后，你就可以想怎么笑就怎么笑了。我计划招募大概一百名手下。我会从美国最有势力的六个帮派中精心挑选人选。这支人马一定会发展成和平时期最强悍最精干的作战部队。”

“那好，诺克斯堡金库有多少人驻守？”金手指慢慢地摇了摇头。他在身后的门上敲了一下。门啪地一声打开了，“得力”就在门口，身子微微弓着，好像要随时发起攻击。但是他看到谈话进行得很平静，就将身子直起，等待着命令。金手指说：“邦德先生，你可能有很多疑问。在今天下午的会上这些疑问就会全部解开了，两点半开始，现在是十二点整。”邦德看了看自己的手表，校准了一下时间。“你和玛斯特顿小姐都要参加会议。会上我会向刚才我提到的那六个帮派的首领宣布我的计划。毋庸置疑，这些人肯定也会像你一样产生各种疑问，到时我会进行详细解释的。之后，你和玛斯特顿小姐就要展开工作。有什么要求你尽管提。‘得力’会尽量满足你的要求，也会提供持久的安全保障。所以，你们最好是不要轻举妄动，否则立刻让你们命丧黄泉。另外，也不要企图逃跑或跟外界进行联系，那完全是浪费时间。既然你要效力于我，那你必须要尽全力。怎么样？成交吗？”

邦德不露声色地说：“我想发财也不是一天两天了。”

金手指没有抬头看他，而是盯着自己的指甲。片刻之后，他抬头狠狠看了邦德一眼，转身出了门，将身后的门关上了。

邦德坐在原地，死死地盯着那扇关闭了的门。突然，他猛地将双手插到头发里抓了两下，又覆盖在脸上。他向着空空的房间大喊了两声：“好吧，好吧。”然后，他站起身来，穿过浴室，走到了蒂莉的卧室门前。他敲了敲门。

“是谁？”

“我。方便吗？”

“方便。”蒂莉冷冷地说，“进来吧。”

她正坐在床边，拿着一只鞋往脚上穿。她身上穿的还是邦德第一次看见她的时候那身衣服。她的样子看起来冷静而又镇定，好像对身边的环境丝毫也不感到惊奇。她抬头看了看邦德，目光冷淡而疏远，还带有一丝轻蔑，冷冷说道：“这处境都是你造成的，你来想办法吧。”

邦德亲切地说：“说不定我还真有办法呢。毕竟我将咱俩从坟墓里拉出来了。”

“先推进去的还差不多。”

邦德若有所思地看着蒂莉。他觉得让她饿着肚子挨批评毕竟是太过冒犯了。他说：“吵架对现在的情况没有任何帮助。不管咱们愿不愿意，都必须要共患难了。你早饭，或者说是午餐，想吃点儿什么？现在都12∶15了，我已经吃过了。我帮你要点儿吃的，然后我再回来，把详细情况说给你听。那是离开这儿的唯一出口，但是那个名叫‘得力’的韩国大猩猩在那儿把守着呢。好吧，告诉我，你是要早饭还是午饭？”

她将身子直起了一点儿：“谢谢。我要炒蛋、咖啡、吐司面包还有果酱。”

“要烟吗？”

“不用了，谢谢，我不抽烟。”

邦德回到自己的房间，敲了敲出口那扇门，门打开了一条小缝。

邦德说：“放心吧，‘得力’，我这会儿还不想杀你呢。”

门缝开得大了一点儿。“得力”脸上漠无表情。邦德把要的东西转述给他。门又关上了。邦德给自己倒了一杯波旁威士忌加苏打水，坐在床边盘算着怎么把蒂莉拉拢过来。她从一开始就憎恨自己，仅仅是因为她姐姐吗？金手指为什么要对她的“倾向性”做了那些秘密的评价？他感觉到这个女子身上有着某种孤僻和敌意的气质，这到底是怎么回事？她很漂亮，很能激发人肉体上的欲望。但是，她身上总是有种冷冷的、生硬的东西，邦德始终理解不了，也说不清楚。好吧，无论如何，现在首要的任务是把她拉拢到自己这边来。否则，这种身陷囹圄的日子肯定是令人难以忍受。

邦德又回到蒂莉的房间。他特意将两个房间之间的门都敞开着，以便能够听到那边的动静。她身上裹着一张毯子，坐在床上一动不动。她谨慎地看着邦德。邦德靠在门框上，将手中的威士忌端到嘴边喝了一大口，看着蒂莉的眼睛说：“我想我最好是告诉你我的背景吧，我是苏格兰场的。”用委婉说法就完全明白了，“我们正在追查这个金手指。他一点儿都不在乎，他觉得至少一星期内谁也找不到我们，这想法应该没错。他饶了我们的性命，因为他有一个大阴谋，他希望我们能够协助他。那笔买卖不小，但是他脑子又不行。有大量的计划和文案要做。咱们可以负责这一块，你会速记和打字吗？”

“会。”她的眼睛一亮，“什么阴谋？”

邦德把事情的原委向她讲述了一遍。又说：“当然了，这计划听起来很荒谬。我想，我只要提出几个问题，哪怕金手指不改变主意，他纠集的那些帮会也会改变主意的。但是，我其实也拿不太准。金手指是个非同寻常的人。据我对他的了解，他这个人不到时机成熟的时候是不会采取行动的。此外，我也并不觉得这个人太过疯狂——至少不比那些其他领域所谓的天才，比如科学家什么的更加疯狂。而且，在他自己的领域，他也绝对称得上是个天才了。”

“那你打算怎么做？”

邦德压低了声音，说：“你应该说，我们打算怎么做。我们要假装合作，而且一定要装到极致，不要偷懒也不要玩笑。我们要假装对金钱很贪婪，我们要给他提供一流的服务。这么做除了可以拯救我们对他来讲一文不值的性命之外，是我们颠覆他唯一的机会了。或者说是我唯一的机会，因为这正是我擅长的事情。”

“你打算具体怎么做？”

“我现在还完全没有头绪。等等看有什么机会吧。”

“你希望我跟你合伙？”

“为什么不呢？难道你还有更好的建议吗？”

她固执地撅起了嘴唇：“我为什么要听你支配？”

邦德叹了口气：“在这个问题上坚持什么女权主义完全没有任何意义。要么听我的，要么吃完这顿饭你就一命呜呼，你自己决定吧。”

蒂莉放松了噘起的嘴唇，嘴边浮现了一丝轻蔑。她耸了耸肩，很没礼貌地说：“哦，那好吧。”忽的，她眼中目光一闪，“但是永远别想碰我一下，否则让你死得很难看。”

这时，邦德房门响起了“笃笃”的敲门声。邦德温柔地俯身看着蒂莉·玛斯特顿说：“你说这话的时候确实挺有魅力的。但是别担心，我不会的。”说完他转身大步走出了房间。

一个韩国人端着给蒂莉的饮食从他身边走过。另一个韩国人则将一张打字桌、一把椅子和一台便携式的雷明顿打字机搬到他的房间。他指示他们把这些东西放到他床边的角落里。“得力”站在门口，手里拿着一张纸。邦德走到他面前，将那张纸接了过来。

那是一大张表格。上面是圆珠笔的字迹，清楚、整洁、书写认真，但是字迹没有什么显著的特征。上面写着：

请将此表复制十份。

会议主持：金先生

秘书：詹姆斯·邦德

蒂莉·玛斯特顿小姐

出席人员：赫尔穆特·M·斯普林格泊普帮　底特律

杰德·米德奈特　幽灵集团　迈阿密及哈瓦那

比利（外号笑脸）·林　机器　芝加哥

杰克·斯戴普　斯庞莱德黑手党　拉斯维加斯

索罗先生　西西里亚诺联合会

计划代号：“猛然一击”

（茶点。）

表格的最下面写着：2∶20来人接你和玛斯特顿小姐。两人都做好做笔记的准备，请着正装。

邦德看完微微一笑。两个韩国人都出去了。他坐到书桌前，将纸和碳盒在打字机上安装停当。至少他要做个样子给蒂莉看看，他准备好开工了。天啊，这是一帮什么样的乌合之众啊！连黑手党也给招募进来了。金手指用什么方法说服了这些人呢？还有，那个普西·葛罗尔小姐是什么人？

两点整，邦德打完了这些表格。他来到蒂莉的房间，把表格、一个速记本和几支铅笔交给她，又将金手指的便条给她念了一遍。他说：“你最好把这些名字记住，估计他们是比较容易辨认的。如果遇到困难我们也可以询问，我去换上正装。”他朝她笑了笑，“二十分钟后出发。”

她点了点头。

“得力”在前面带路，邦德跟在后面。穿过走廊的时候听到了河流的声音——浪花拍打着仓库的地基，一只渡船发出悲切的汽笛声，还有远处柴油机工作的声音。在他脚下的某个地方，一辆卡车发动起来，发动机轰隆轰隆响了一会儿，然后大概是朝着西边的高速公路慢慢开走了。他们现在肯定是在一座长形的两层楼房的顶层，走廊里的灰色墙面散发出一股新刷的油漆的气味。整条走廊上都没有其他的房门，顶上的几个碗形吊灯发出的光照亮了走廊。他们很快走到了走廊的尽头。

“得力”敲了敲门，门后传来了钥匙转动和拉开门栓的声音，他们穿过那扇门，进入了一个被阳光照得亮亮的大屋子。这间房间处于整个仓库的尽头，一扇大型落地窗几乎占满了一整面墙，从窗口可以看到一条河和远处呈现出一团棕黄色的泽西市。房间显然是为一会儿的会议进行了特意布置。

金手指背靠落地窗坐在圆桌旁边。桌上铺着绿色粗呢桌布，并且放着玻璃水瓶、黄色便笺纸以及铅笔等物品。桌边有九张舒适的扶手椅，在其中的六张椅子前面放着的便签纸上还有六个长方形的白色小盒子，盒子上盖有红色的封印。右边靠墙的地方，是一个长长的自助餐台，上面摆放的银器和雕花玻璃杯闪闪发亮。餐台上一个银质冷却箱里放着一瓶香槟酒和其他几个酒瓶。在各色各样的食物中，尤其吸引邦德注意的是两罐各重五磅的鲟鱼子酱以及几罐鹅肝酱。餐台正对的墙上，一块黑板悬挂于一张桌子正上方，桌子上摆着一些纸张和一个长方形的纸箱。

金手指看着他们从厚厚的酒红色地毯上向他走来，示意蒂莉·玛斯特顿坐到他左边的椅子上，而邦德坐到他右边的椅子上。他们都依照他的指示坐了下来。

“表格呢？”金手指接过表格，看了看最上面那张，然后又把它们递回到蒂莉手中。他把手举起，做了一个画圆的姿势。她站起身来将表格发到桌边的每一座位上。金手指将手伸到桌下，按响了一个隐藏的电铃。房间一头的一扇门打开了，一个韩国人走了进来，站在那里等候命令。“都准备就绪了吗？”韩国人点了点头。

“除了名单上的人，其余人等一律不准入内，明白了吗？好。这些人可能会带随从，让他们的随从在接待室等候，确保满足他们所有需求。牌和骰子呢？‘得力’。”金手指抬头看了看一直站在邦德身后的那个韩国人，“去吧，守好你的位置，信号是什么？”“得力”举起两根手指。“没错，两声铃响。去吧，确保每个人都能完美地尽到职责。”

邦德漫不经心地说：“你手下有多少人手？”

“20个。10个韩国人，10个德国人。他们都是经过我精心挑选的，绝对精干。大部分是我从这座房子里挑选出来的，这里就好像是军舰的三等舱。”金手指将他的手掌在他面前的桌子上摊开。“现在听好你们的职责：玛斯特顿小姐，如果讨论中提到了任何切实可行的提议，把它记下来，也就是说我能付诸行动的一些建议，不必在那些争论、吵闹之类的东西上耗费精力。好吧？”

看到蒂莉·玛斯特顿现在显得聪明而又精干，邦德感到暗暗高兴。她轻快地点点头，说：“明白。”

“而你，邦德先生，我需要你向我报告你对这些人产生的任何印象。我非常了解这些人，在他们各自的地盘，他们都是至高无上的老大。其实我是通过贿赂把他们集中到这里的，他们对我没有丝毫了解，我必须要让他们感觉我对自己的计划了如指掌，并且跟着我他们必然收获颇丰，其他的就由他们的贪欲搞定了。但是没准儿会有一两个打退堂鼓的，他们一定会显露出一些蛛丝马迹。针对这种情况我也做了些特殊的安排，但是可能也会有人产生迟疑。在谈话过程中，你就在这张表格上做些笔记。你就在每个人的名字后面画个符号，比如加号或减号，标记出他们是持支持态度还是反对态度，这些记号必须确保我能看懂。你的意见对我会很有帮助。别忘了，邦德先生，如果出现了任何叛徒和临阵脱逃的人，一定要确保他受到应有的惩罚，要么让他命丧当场，要么让他在监狱里度过余生。”

“这个黑人区的普西·葛罗尔是什么人？”

“她是美国唯一一个女子帮派首领。那个帮派成员都是女人。我的计划里需要一些女人效力。她绝对可靠，是个杂技演员。她还有个班子，叫‘普西·葛罗尔和她的爱猫’。”金手指脸上表情一丝不苟，“班子并不火，所以她就把班子的成员训练成了盗贼，猫盗贼。这个组织慢慢发展成了一个冷酷无比的帮派。那是个女同性恋组织，现在自称‘水泥搅拌车’。现在连美国最大的帮派也敬她们三分，这个女人不寻常。”

这时，桌子下面传出了一声轻轻的铃声，金手指坐直身子。房间尽头的门轻快地打开了，五个人依次走了进来。金手指站起身来，点头致意，他说：“我姓金，诸位请坐吧。”

几个人轻声地议论了几句，之后他们默默地围到桌子周围，拉出椅子，坐了下来，五双眼睛谨慎而冷酷地盯着金手指。金手指也坐了下来，他轻声说：“各位绅士，在你们面前的盒子里，各有一根24K金的金条，价值15000美元。首先我想先感谢各位百忙之中抽出时间参加这次会议。大家手中的安排表不言自明。我想，在我们等候葛罗尔小姐的同时，请允许我将诸位介绍给我的秘书邦德先生和玛斯特顿小姐。本次会议不做任何记录，当然，如果各位希望有记录，那就另当别论。我保证会场内也不会装备任何录音设备。好吧，邦德先生，您右边的这位是杰德·米德奈特先生，来自迈阿密和哈瓦那的‘幽灵集团’。”米德奈特先生身材魁梧，生活讲究，面容和善，心思细致，身穿淡蓝色轻薄外套，内衬带有绿色棕榈树图案的白色丝质衬衫，手腕上佩戴的精致金表估计重达半磅。

他朝邦德挤出一丝不自然的微笑，说：“你好。”

“下面我来介绍比利·林先生，他手下掌管的正是著名的芝加哥‘机器’组织。”

邦德朝那人看了一眼，心想：还真是人如其名(1)。那是一张噩梦般的脸，向邦德转过来的时候，似乎自己也知道自己长得是什么德行，那双眼睛死死盯着邦德，好像在看他对自己是什么反应。那张脸脸色苍白，脸型像个鸭梨的形状，一头枯黄的头发乱蓬蓬的，但是那双眼睛，本该是淡蓝的颜色，却呈现出黄褐色。围绕瞳孔四周的一圈眼白使这冷酷而又若有所思的目光带有了一点催眠的作用。右眼皮规律性的痉挛让右眼看起来好像在随着心脏一起跳动。可能在林先生入道之初下眼皮曾经被什么人砍掉过——或许是他当时多嘴惹的祸——后果就是他的脸上似乎带上了一个微笑的假面具，就像万圣节的南瓜灯上的微笑，看样子他的年龄大概四十来岁。邦德对他总体的印象就是：这是个冷血杀手。邦德直视他的左眼笑了笑，就将目光转向金手指介绍的下一位了——底特律波普帮的赫尔穆特·斯普林格先生。

斯普林格先生的目光显得呆滞无神，从这目光判断，或者他非常有钱，或者他已然失去了生气。那双眼睛就像黯淡无光的淡蓝色玻璃球，迅速看了邦德先生一眼，那目光就赶紧收回，好像重新陷入了沉思。斯普林格先生身上其他的特征都符合“杰出人物”的身份。休闲条纹哈赛维衬衫，身上散发的维尔瓦须后水的气味儿。他这一身打扮给人的印象是他与身边的几位有点儿格格不入——好像是持有一等座车票的旅客坐到了三等座的车厢，买了包厢票的观众却被引到了大厅就座。

米德奈特先生将手遮到嘴边，小声提醒邦德：“别被这家伙的外表迷惑了，我的朋友赫尔穆特先生是那种喜欢在脸上贴金的人。他女儿上了瓦萨学院(2)，但是供女儿上学的钱还不是他收上来的保护费吗？”

邦德点了点头，表示感谢。

“西西里亚诺联合会的索罗先生。”

索罗先生面色黝黑，大脸盘，阴郁的表情似乎诉说着太多的罪责。他朝邦德轻轻抬了一下头，脸上那副厚厚的边框眼镜反射出一道亮光，紧接着就又低头从自己口袋里拿出一把小刀开始修剪指甲了。他是个大块头，看外表像个拳击运动员，又像个领班侍者。从他的外貌很难判断他脑子里想的是什么，他的长处是什么。但是在美国只有唯一一个黑手党领袖，如果索罗先生能够确立他的领袖地位，邦德心想，那么他肯定是具有制造恐怖的强大力量，他能保住这一地位的原因也肯定在于此。

“幸会。”斯庞莱德黑手党的杰克·斯戴普先生具备拉斯维加斯赌场头面人物的典型特征，但是邦德猜测他肯定也是在很大程度上受到了前辈斯潘兄弟的影响。他年龄大概五十岁左右，衣着奢华绚丽。他手上拿着的一支雪茄马上就要吸完了，确切地说，他不是在吸雪茄，而是在吃雪茄。他贪婪地嚼着，并且不时地回头将嘴里的雪茄残渣吐到身后的地毯上。这种强迫症般的吸烟动作使气氛显得非常紧张。斯戴普先生的眼神像魔术师一样的锐利，大概他也不希望自己那凌厉的目光吓坏邦德，此刻他将那双眼睛微微眯起，盯着墙角。

正在此时，房间一头的那扇门打开了，门口站着一位女士，身穿黑色套装，剪裁偏男性化，胸前带有咖啡色的蕾丝装饰。她缓慢而自然地走进房间，站在那张空椅子后面。金手指站起身来。她先是仔细打量了一下金手指，继而目光环视了一下圆桌四周坐着的其他人。她干巴巴地朝所有人说了声“嗨”，坐了下来。斯戴普先生说：“嗨，普西。”其他人也都小声打了招呼，只有斯普林格先生只是微微地欠了欠身。

金手指说：“下午好，葛罗尔小姐，我们正在进行介绍呢。日程安排表就在您面前，同时还有一根价值15000美元的金条，作为您参加这次会议的劳务费用以及为您带来各种不便的补偿，还望您笑纳。”

葛罗尔小姐拿起盒子打开，将那根金光闪闪的金条拿在手里掂了掂。她面带率直而又怀疑的表情，问金手指：“要从始至终地参加会议吗？”

“对。”

葛罗尔小姐盯着他的眼睛，用生硬的语气说：“请原谅我的冒昧。”

邦德很喜欢她的样子。她身上带有一种美貌的女同性恋具有的性感气质，对男人具备巨大的诱惑力。她对金手指以及房间里其他人说话时候那种不妥协的态度让邦德颇为欣赏。她的态度好像在宣扬着自己的观点：“所有男人不是混蛋就是骗子，在我这儿别使你们男人那些骗人的伎俩，我不吃这一套，我跟你们不是一路人。”邦德判断这女子大概三十出头的样子。她皮肤白皙，五官精致，高颧骨，下巴线条很美，长得有点像鲁伯特·布鲁克(3)。她是邦德见过的唯一一个拥有紫色眼睛的人，那是真正的三色堇的颜色，此刻正在那副直直的黑色眉毛下直率地盯着这个世界。她留着有点凌乱的短发，发色像蒂莉·玛斯特顿的头发一样乌黑，深红色的嘴唇透出一丝果断坚毅。邦德想这可真算得上是女中豪杰，并且他也注意到，蒂莉·玛斯特顿此刻正用崇拜的目光看着葛罗尔小姐，脸上满是敬慕的表情。邦德突然明白蒂莉·玛斯特顿先前对他为什么是那样冰冷敌对的态度了。

金手指说：“现在请允许我向各位做一下自我介绍，其实‘金’不是我的真实姓氏，请大家听听我的真实身份。20年来，通过各种手段，这其中当然大部分属于非法手段，我赚了很多钱，我的财产现在总计多达六千万美元（圆桌四周传来了充满崇敬的“唔”的声音）。我的活动大部分集中在欧洲范围内。大家可能听说过在香港经营的‘金罂粟分销公司’，那个公司最初也是由我建立，但随后我已经将之抛弃了（杰克·斯戴普轻轻地吹了一声口哨）。‘快乐着陆旅行社’也是由我组织建立的，后来我也亲自解散了它，没准儿各位当年遇到急事儿的时候也跟他们打过交道吧（赫尔穆特·斯普林格将他那无框单片眼镜朝一只眼睛推了推，以便于更仔细地观察金手指）。我提起这些小事情的主要目的是想告诉大家，虽然大家可能不认识我，但是在过去很多时候，我是以某种方式捍卫过大家的利益的。（‘好吧，精明能干呢！’杰德·米德奈特小声嘟囔了一句，声音里带有些许敬畏）。先生们——呃——还有女士，这就是我得以认识大家的原因，也使我今晚有幸凭自己的经验组织这次行动，我想这次行动应该称得上是美国犯罪中的贵族了。”

邦德不禁叹服不已。只用了短短三分钟的时间，金手指已经完全控制了会议的局势，使之变得对自己相当有利了。

此刻，每一个人都以强烈的眼光关注着金手指，甚至连普西·葛罗尔小姐也是全神贯注。邦德对于“金罂粟分销商”和“快乐着陆旅行社”都没有任何了解，但是从以往这两个公司的客户脸上的表情看，它们肯定是在业内做得很成功了。现在，每个人都恭恭敬敬地等着金手指继续说下去，好像在听爱因斯坦上课一样。

金手指脸上没有任何表情，他的右手做了一个将物品抛出的姿势。

他语调平缓地说：“我刚才提了两个我做过的工程，虽然成功，但是规模不大。实际上我还经营过一些更大规模的企业，没有一个失败过，而且据我所知，我的名字也从没有出现在任何国家的抓捕名单上。我提这一点是想向大家说明，我对自己从事的行业是绝对的了解。各位女士先生们，我现在要组织一项大事业，而我愿意向各位提供一个合作的机会，我向大家保证，只要参与，各位的资产能够在一个星期之内增加十亿。”金手指举起手，“我们在欧洲可能跟各位用的货币单位不一样，但我指的是十亿美元，我的意思大家都听清楚了吧？”

第十八章　犯罪之王


窗外的河面上传来了一声拖船的汽笛声，紧接着又是一声，然后是引擎的轰鸣声渐行渐远。坐在邦德右边的杰德·米德奈特先生清了清嗓子，坚决地说：“金先生，或者不管你的真实姓氏是什么吧，不用纠结什么货币单位的问题。不管是英镑还是美元，十亿都不是个小数，继续吧。”

索罗先生抬起他那迟钝的黑色眼睛，看着桌子对面的金手指，说：“钱不少，没错。但是你拿多少，先生？”

“五十亿。”

拉斯维加斯的斯戴普先生发出了一声短促而响亮的笑声，“听到了吗，伙计们？朋友之间的利润差异也不是很大嘛！如果，这位，呃——无名氏先生能给我十亿美元的收益，那么我拿出个五块十块来酬谢他也不为过啊，咱们就别那么心胸狭窄了，哈？”

赫尔穆特·斯普林格先生拿着他的单片眼镜在他面前的金条上敲了敲。大家的目光都聚集在他的身上。

“呃，金先生。”他声音低沉，听起来像个家族律师，“您刚才提及的数目可以说是非常大。以我个人的理解，总数将高达一百一十亿了吧！”

金手指提供了一个较为精确的数字：“确切数字应该是将近一百五十亿。我刚才提到的一百一十亿是我估计我们能够带走的数字。”

比利·林兴奋地尖声笑了两声。

“安静，请安静，金先生，”斯普林格先生又将他的单片眼镜塞到眼前，仔细观察着金手指的反应，“但是在美国，拥有那么多钱或价值那么多钱的财产的只有三个地方，一是位于华盛顿的联邦铸币厂，二是位于纽约市的联邦储备银行，三是位于肯塔基的诺克斯堡。您是计划组织我们——呃——‘拿下’其中之一吗？如果是的话，目标是哪一个呢？”

“诺克斯堡。”

在一片叹息声中，米德奈特先生用有点无可奈何的口气说：“先生，除了在好莱坞我还是第一次见到像您这样拥有这种特质的人，我们或许可以将之称为‘梦想’。而这所谓的‘梦想’，先生，就是说你容易将眼前看到的东西想象成绝妙的景象，您或许该去看看您的脑科医生或者服点儿安定试试了。”米德奈特忧伤地摇了摇头，“可惜，那十亿美元到手的感觉肯定会相当不错的。”

普西·葛罗尔小姐用低沉、厌烦的声音说：“不好意思，先生，我手下的人对于拿下那大‘存钱罐’无能为力。”说完做了一个要站起身来的动作。

金手指和蔼可亲地说：“请听我说完，各位先生们——呃——还有女士。大家的这种反应是正常的。我这么说吧：诺克斯堡其实就像是一家银行，而且跟别的银行没有什么两样，只是规模更大。因此它的防御系统也就更加坚固、更加精巧。要想击破当然也就需要我们的攻击力量足够强大，手段精巧。这是我的计划唯一新颖之处——就是大，别无其他了。诺克斯堡跟其他堡垒比起来并不是更加坚不可摧的。正如我们之前也都认为布林克组织是不可战胜的，然而1950年，一个五六个人组成的团队就从一辆布林克装甲车上抢劫了一百万美元。似乎从纽约市的新新监狱逃走也是不可能的事，但是还是有人越狱成功。不，不，先生们。诺克斯堡跟其他所谓的神话也一样，并不是坚不可破的。现在大家愿意继续听我介绍我的计划了吗？”

比利·林说话跟日本人似的，总是发出“嘶嘶”的声音。他厉声说：“我说，先生，可能你不知道，第三装甲师就在诺克斯堡。如果诺克斯堡像你说的那么不堪一击，那俄国佬为什么不趁下次来美国打冰球比赛的时候攻占美国呢？”

金手指淡淡一笑：“希望我对您说法的更正不会冒犯到您，林先生。下面我要介绍诺克斯堡驻守部队的队形。驻守在那里的其实只有第三装甲师的先头部队，此外还有第六装甲骑兵团、第15装甲团、第160工程团，以及来自装甲补充训练中心和军队人力资源一号研究所的大约半个师的美国陆军兵力，还有大陆装甲指挥委员会第二分会、陆军维持委员会以及与装甲中心有关的其他各种单位。除此之外，还有由20名警官和400名左右的在编警员组成的警队。总之，在驻守的六万余人中，大约有两万人属于某种作战部队。”

“谁能跟他们抗衡呢？”杰克·斯戴普叼着雪茄嘲讽地说。没有等到有人回答，他就把烟头从嘴里扯出来，在烟灰缸里碾成了碎末，看起来很恶心。

坐在他身边的普西·葛罗尔小姐用力嘬了嘬牙床，说：“去买点好烟抽吧，杰克，你嘴里那玩意儿闻着跟摔跤运动员身上的味儿差不多，臭烘烘的。”

“得了吧，普西。”斯戴普先生不客气地说。

葛罗尔小姐嘴上也不饶人，甜甜地说：“你知道吗，杰克？我可仰慕像你这样的汉子了。我还给你写过一首歌呢，想听听歌名吗？‘若有机会比试，一定要比你强’。”

米德奈特发出了一声刺耳的大笑，林也禁不住咯咯笑了起来。金手指轻轻敲了几下桌子，维持了一下秩序，耐着性子说：“先生们，请大家认真听我讲下去。”他站起身来，走到黑板前面，从黑板上端将一幅卷轴的地图拉开。那是一张详细的诺克斯堡地图，上面标明了戈德曼陆军机场的位置，以及通往城里的公路和铁路线路。坐在桌子右侧的与会成员朝地图方向转了转椅子。金手指指着地图上美国金库所在的位置。那个位置在地图的左下角，位于由迪克西公路、黄金大道和葡萄园路所构成的一个三角形中间。金手指说：“稍后我给大家介绍抢劫金库的详细计划。”他顿了顿说，“先生们，现在，请允许我向各位介绍这个结构简单明了的小镇的一些主要特征。这儿——”他的手指从地图上方的中间地带开始，向下划过整个城区，一直越过美国金库的所在位置，“是伊利诺伊中央铁路的线路，起点是路易斯维尔，向北35英里，穿过城区，然后向南延伸到80英里以外的伊丽莎白镇。我们暂且放着位于城区中心地带的布莱登堡站不去管它。我们要关心的是各路复杂的侧线相交处的金银库。那是华盛顿铸币厂的诸多金条装卸点之一。出于安全方面的考虑，运输方式是多种多样的，包括通过迪克西公路用卡车运送，或是通过货运飞机运往戈德曼机场。大家可以看到，金库位于一片大约50英亩的草地上，与这些道路都不直接相邻，并且也没有什么天然的遮蔽。通往金库的只有一条道路，那是一条长50码的车道，布置了几重厚重的装甲门，被称为黄金大道。进入到布满武装的栅栏后，卡车会沿一条环形公路行驶，一直到达金库的后门，并在那里将黄金卸下。先生们，这条环形公路全部是由钢板或钢片制造而成的。这些钢板上面还安装了铰链，如果有紧急情况，整个钢质的路面可以通过液压抬起，形成第二层的钢铁防御。地图上看不出来，但是我却了解一点，在黄金大道和葡萄园路之间有一条地下运输通道。这是另一条通往金库内部的道路，途中也设置了几重钢门，沿着这条地下通道最后能够到达金库的负一层。”

金手指顿了顿，从地图边走开了几步。他环视了一下圆桌四周：“好吧，先生们。这是金库以及通往金库内部的主要道路的基本情况。我刚才唯一没有提及的是金库的正门，进去之后就是接待大厅和办公室。有什么问题吗？”

没有人提问。所有人的目光都集中在金手指身上，默默地等着。金手指权威的发言又一次吸引了所有人的注意，在他们看来，眼前这个人对于诺克斯堡不为人知的情况好像出奇的了解。

金手指又转身回到黑板旁边，拉出另外一张地图，覆盖在刚才那张的上面。

接下来，金手指开始介绍抢劫金库的详细计划，说：“那好，先生们，大家可以看到，这是一座规模庞大、坚不可摧的两层建筑。看上去有点儿像一块方方正正的双层蛋糕。各位请注意，楼顶上布满了地雷，你能看到地面四角各有一个弹箱。它们同样是钢铁铸造的，与建筑物内部相连。金库的外部面积是105英尺乘121英尺。高度是地面以上42英尺。建筑的主体是田纳西花岗岩，内部有钢筋。确切的构成为：16000立方英尺的花岗岩，4000立方码的水泥，750吨的钢筋用于加固，760吨的钢筋用于建筑框架。对吧？那么建筑物的内部呢？这钢筋水泥建造的两层建筑内部分成了若干隔间。金库门重达20多吨。金库表面是钢板、工字钢，以及外面包有水泥并且带有圆箍的钢柱。金库上下两层内部各有一个环形走廊连通，通过走廊可以到达金库以及位于建筑物外墙处的办公室、储藏室等。任何人都不知道金库大门的密码。金库的几个高级职员分别输入他们所掌握的密码的一部分，才能共同开启大门。当然了，金库当然也安装了最新最好的安全保护设施。楼内设有绝对可靠的警戒岗位，并且，强大的加强警戒系统24小时开启，会将任何异常情况实时反映给不到一英里之外的武装中心。大家都听懂了吧？好，现在，说说金库里的东西吧——我先前已经提到过了，那些黄金价值大概一百五十亿美元，是标准的千足金。每一根都是现在各位面前的金条的两倍大，重四百盎司，用常衡计算的话合27.5磅。存放在金库里的这些金条没有任何包装。”金手指环顾了一下圆桌四周，“各位女士先生们，这些就是我能跟大家分享的关于诺克斯堡金库的所有信息，而我觉得了解这些也就足够了。如果大家没有什么问题，我将继续向大家解释攻破这个金库，以及夺取里面藏有的黄金的方法。”

房间里一片沉寂，圆桌四周的几双眼睛专注而热切。杰克·斯戴普紧张地从他的背心口袋里拿出一支中号的雪茄，塞到了嘴角里。

普西·葛罗尔厉声说：“你要敢把那东西点着，我就用这块金砖砸死你。”一边说着一边把自己面前的金砖拿在手里，以示威胁。

“放轻松，年轻人。”斯戴普从嘴角挤出了这句话。

杰德·米德奈特果断地评论道：“先生，干成这一票肯定会给你带来无上的荣誉，继续给我们讲下去吧。这个计划要么让你一败涂地，要么让你成为犯罪之王。”

金手指漠不关心地说：“很好，先生们。现在请听我的详细介绍。”说到这里他停顿了一下，依次注视着圆桌周围的每个人的眼睛。但是我希望大家能够明白一点：从现在开始，我们必须确保绝对的安全。到目前为止，我所说的话还可以被别人认为是神经病人的唠唠叨叨。但是我接下来要说的，可就要把在座的各位全部卷入到美国历史上和平时期最大的阴谋里了。我是否可以理解为现在我们都已经成了一条绳上的蚂蚱了？大家都愿意绝对地保守秘密吧？”

几乎是出于本能，邦德盯住了来自底特律的赫尔穆特·斯普林格的眼睛。在此起彼伏的肯定的确认声中，斯普林格垂下了眼皮。他装腔作势地说了一句：“我郑重承诺。”听起来无比的空洞。在邦德看来，他这句话的可信程度跟二手汽车经销商推销的时候说的话差不多，于是他随手在日程表上斯普林格的名字旁边画了一条短短的横线。

“那真是太好了。”金手指返回到自己的座位，坐了下来，拿起一支铅笔，仿佛在跟那支铅笔若有所思地交谈着，“首先的一个问题，或许也是最难解决的一个问题，是战利品的运输。价值150亿美元的黄金重约1000吨。这个数量需要由100辆载重十吨的卡车或者20辆六轮重型工业运输车来运送，我建议用后者。我这里有一张单子，上面列举了出租这种汽车的特许公司。我建议，如果大家都同意合作，本次会议结束之后，各位立即采取行动，联系自己势力范围内的相关公司。大家肯定是需要用自己手下的司机，这个原因不言而喻。这件事情就全权交由各位处理。毫无疑问，”金手指脸上露出了一丝诡异的微笑，“卡车司机协会会提供不少靠得住的人选，大家可以考虑雇佣战时曾为美国部队服务过的黑人红球快运公司的司机。当然了，这些属于一些细节，还需要进一步精确的计划和协调。行动期间我们可能还会遭遇交通管制问题，这方面也得需要大家在自己的地盘做好安排，扫清道路。运输机也作为一种备选的运输方式，我们也要提前做好安排，保证戈德曼机场的南北跑道畅通。大家自己应得的那份黄金的运输当然就得靠自己了。对于我来说，”金手指冷静地看着坐在桌边的人们，“我会先用铁路运输，我分得的份额最大，因此请大家允许我先预定下这种运输方式。”没有等别人发表任何评论，金手指又继续用平静的语气说：“跟运输方面的问题比起来，其他事情就显得简单多了。首先，细节一，必须解除驻守诺克斯堡的所有力量的武装，不管军方的还是民间的。我已经做好了详细的安排，一切只等我发号施令了。简而言之，整个城镇的饮用水以及其他生活用水都是由两口水井和两个过滤厂提供的，每天出产的水量大约不到七百万加仑，它们处于岗位工程师的控制之下。我已经派人假扮东京市自来水的厂长或副厂长前来参观学习，希望在为东京安装新的城市供水系统借鉴他们的经验，这位先生肯定会非常乐于接待的。这个请求会让这位岗位工程师荣幸之至，而那位日本的先生也要进行全方位的包装，不能露出任何破绽。当然，这两位先生实际上都是我的人，他们都会被施以适度的催眠，这种方法就是在上一场战争期间由德国医药战事专家专门为此种目的设计发明的。这种物质可以溶于水，通过水迅速传播，任何人只要喝下半杯这种稀释液之后，立刻就会陷入暂时的昏迷状态。在别人看来，昏迷的人就好像快速陷入了深度睡眠，大约三天之后就会重新醒来。”金手指伸出一只手，手掌朝上，“今年六月份，在肯塔基，我亲自验证过，一个人在完全不喝水的情况下，可以坚持24小时。当年诺曼底登陆的那天，士兵们可能看到的是遍地的美酒，但是我们进入这个小镇的时候，我希望看到的景象是全城的人全都在他们的岗位上陷入了深度睡眠。”

“那该是多棒的一幅景象啊！”葛罗尔眼睛放光，仿佛已经看到了那幅景象一般。

“计划得挺圆满，”杰克·斯戴普乖戾地说，“那就干吧，先生。听着不错。那么咱们怎么进城。”

“咱们进入城区的渠道是，”金手指说，“一辆特别专列，它将于第一天的晚上从纽约出发，咱们的队伍大概100人，都要扮成红十字会的工作人员。我希望葛罗尔小姐的人来假扮护士分队。这是个不起眼的角色，但是非常重要，这也是为什么我要邀请葛罗尔小姐参加这次会议的原因。”

葛罗尔小姐满腔热情地说：“收到，照办，完毕。我手下的姑娘们扮相肯定甜美，你觉得呢，杰克？”她身体朝旁边倾斜，用胳膊肘轻轻碰了碰斯戴普的肋骨。

“我觉得她们要是穿上水泥大衣看起来会更好。”斯戴普先生不耐烦地说，“你这么闲着没事儿插嘴有必要吗？继续说吧，先生。”

“在距离诺克斯堡35英里的路易斯维尔，我和我的一名助理会请求允许登上头车。我们会携带一些专业的仪器，就说因为火车要接近诺克斯堡，所以必须由我们来进行空气质量检测。与此同时，一则城区居民感染了一种神秘疾病的消息会在外界散布传播，并且在周边区域乃至全国引起恐慌。在我们黎明时分到达目的地时，预计会有救援直升机到达。我们下一步的计划就是操控戈德曼机场的控制塔，宣布基地已经关闭，所有飞机改变飞行路线，飞往路易斯维尔。对了，再交代点儿之前的情况，离开路易斯维尔不久之后，我和我的助理就会搞定司机以及消防员，我们会尽量使用仁慈一点儿的手段的（鬼才信，邦德心想）。而火车将由我亲自来驾驶——我个人是掌握了驾驶火车的基本技术的——我们将穿过诺克斯堡到达金库的铁路侧线，旁边就是存放黄金的库房了。”金手指顿了一下，用阴郁的目光慢慢地环视了一圈。他好像对看到的景象很满意，又继续用平淡的语调说着：“此时，各位女士和先生们，你们的运输队也应该到达了。根据提前所做的计划，飞行管制员会提前在金库附近区域待命，然后机场工作人员会乘坐卡车到达戈德曼机场并将机场接管过来。此时，城里的所有人都已经陷入了睡眠状态，因此无须我们费神。大家就把他们看作是这个地方风景的一种——呃——装饰物就好了。对吧？”

索罗那双黑色的眼睛释放出激情的目光，从桌子对面投了过来。他柔声说道：“当然，到目前为止还没有什么问题。那么现在呢，可能你只要——”他鼓起腮帮，快速而用力地朝金手指吹了一口气，“像这样，就能让那重达20吨的门自己倒下了。是吗？”

“没错。”金手指不慌不忙地说，“差不多就是那样的。”他站起身，走到那块黑板下的桌子旁边，将那个又大又丑的箱子搬起来，小心翼翼地搬到圆桌上来，放到了自己面前。那箱子看起来分量不轻。

他又坐下来，继续说：“我那十名训练有素的助理会负责做好打开金库的准备，之后，担架编队将负责进入金库，尽全力将里面的驻守人员转移到安全地带。”邦德觉得他在金手指接下来的话里听出了一丝阴险奸诈。“我想诸位都会同意我这个看法，各位女士和先生们，我们应该尽量避免不必要的生命损失。到目前为止，我希望诸位注意到了，除了伊利诺伊中央铁路的两名员工以外，我们并没有导致任何的伤亡。何况这两个人还脾气暴躁，也算是罪有应得。”金手指没有等任何人说话，就继续下去了。“现在，”他伸出手放在箱子上面，“当你们，先生们，和你们的合伙人需要武器，我指的不是那种常见的小型武装，你们会去哪里找呢？当然是军队系统了，先生们。你们会从附近军事基地的军需官或者仓库保管员那里购买冲锋枪和其他的一些重型武器。你们期间可能会使用施加压力、敲诈或是贿赂等各种手段，我也不例外。能够炸开诺克斯堡金库大门的只有一种武器，而我几经周折，终于在一个德国的联合军事基地弄到了一个，这东西可是花掉了我一百万美元啊。先生们，这是一颗专门为下士中程导弹设计制造的核弹头。”

“耶稣基督啊！”杰德·米德奈特伸出双手紧紧抓住桌子边。圆桌周围每一个人都变得面无血色。邦德也感觉到了自己下巴上的皮肤紧紧地绷了起来。为了缓解一下自己的紧张情绪，他伸手从衣服内兜里掏出一包切斯特菲尔德香烟，拿出一根点上。他慢慢吹熄了香烟上的火苗，然后将打火机放回到衣服口袋里。全能的上帝啊！他这是卷入了一场什么样的混乱啊。邦德回顾了一下他和金手指认识的过程。邦德第一次与他碰面是在佛罗丽迪亚娜的卡巴那俱乐部的屋顶上，金手指棕色的身体半裸着。当时，他轻轻松松揭穿了金手指的小把戏。与M的那次会面交谈，还有在银行的那次会面，当时只知道谈的是追查一名黄金走私犯的事情——虽说是一条大鱼，也是服务于俄国人的——但不管怎么说那也只是个一般意义上的罪犯。邦德费尽心思在高尔夫球比赛中赢了他，并且后来又成功地追踪了他，那个时候，他还和其他的罪犯没有多大区别。而现在，你已经不能把他看成是洞中一只狡猾的兔子了，甚至说他是狐狸也不准确，应该说他是一条眼镜王蛇——世界上最大最危险的动物！邦德消沉地叹了口气，又有一次严重的破坏活动要发生了，朋友们！这次将是圣乔治与龙(1)的现实版。这条恶龙甚至已经开始自信满满地产卵了。圣乔治最好是抓紧采取行动，在这条恶龙孵出小龙之前采取点什么措施了。邦德紧张地笑了笑，想：能做什么？有什么是他能够做的呢？

金手指举起一只手，说：“各位女士、先生们，相信我，这东西现在就是一块完全无害的大铁块，它还没有经过武装呢。即使我现在用锤子砸它也不会爆炸的。在经过武装之前它根本无法引爆。一切都要等时机成熟的那天。”

比利·林的脸上露出了甜美的微笑。他一边挤出一丝假笑一边用有点颤抖的声音说：“先生，这……这玩意儿的……叫什么来着……辐射……厉害吗？”

“辐射会非常小，林先生，并且辐射区域也很小。这是最新技术——所谓的‘清洁型’原子弹。但是我们还是会为第一批进入废墟的人配备防护服，由他们充当众多工序中的第一个环节，将黄金运送到外面等候的卡车上。”

“那么四处飞溅的残渣呢，先生？还有水泥块、钢筋碎片之类的东西怎么防？”米德奈特先生的声音仿佛是从他腹部深处发出的。

“我们要在金库外的钢质栅栏外暂行躲避，米德奈特先生。所有人都必须佩带耳塞。卡车肯定会受到一定损伤，但是这种损失应该在我们接受范围之内。”

“那些睡着了的人们呢？”索罗的眼睛闪烁着贪婪的目光，“估计他们得多睡一会儿了？”但是显然，索罗一点儿也不在乎那些熟睡的人们。

“我们可以在安全范围内尽量多搬一些。行动会对城镇有些损坏，恐怕我们必须得承认这一点。我估计伤亡人数大概相当于诺克斯堡三天之内的交通事故造成的伤亡人数，我们要把我们造成的伤亡控制在这个水平以内。”

“咱们还真他妈的善良呢！”米德奈特的神经现在似乎已经完全放松下来了。

“还有其他问题吗？”金手指和蔼地说。他分析了数据，估计了前景，现在是时候进行投票阶段了。

“计划的细节还有待于进一步的推敲，在这方面，我的人——”他先是将身体转向邦德，然后转向玛斯特顿小姐，“会协助我。这间房间就是我们的行动指挥室，大家无论白天晚上都可以进入。此次行动的代码为‘猛然一击’，每次需要提到这次行动必须使用这个代码。请容许我建议在座每一位愿意参与的成员指定一名可靠的助理，每人仅限一名。其他手下只需要接受相应的培训来实现他们在各个环节的功能就可以了，就像普通的银行抢劫活动没什么两样。行动第一天，我们将适当地增加推荐助理的人数。如果诸位决定参与，我想我可以信赖大家，各位女士和先生们，相信你们可以像对待一场战争一样对待我们这个计划。当然，我们应该果断地对待一些不安全因素和低效因素。现在，各位女士和先生们，我请诸位代表自己的组织表态。谁愿意加入？这次行动可谓是低风险、高收益。米德奈特先生？”金手指将头向右转过去一英寸。邦德看见金手指那X射线般的目光射向他的邻座。

“干？”他顿了一下，“还是不干？”

第十九章　密信


“金先生，”杰德·米德奈特朗朗地说，“毋庸置疑，自从该隐杀死其弟亚伯由此发明了谋杀之后，您可以称得上是犯罪史上的王者了。”他稍作停顿之后坚决地说，“能够加入这次行动与您合作将是我的无上荣幸。”

“多谢，米德奈特先生。您呢，林先生？”邦德觉得比利·林好像不是很可靠。除了林和赫尔穆特·斯普林格之外，他在名单上其他的名字之后都画上了加号。林的名字后边他是画了一个0，而斯普林格的名字后面是一个减号。他是通过观察这些人的眼神、嘴巴、手等得到的这些结论。但是“笑脸”脸上那一成不变的假笑让他摸不到任何头绪。他的右眼眨眼的频率像节拍器一样稳定，而且他的双手也都一直放在桌面以下。

现在，比利·林将双手从桌面下挪到桌面上，在他面前的绿色粗呢桌布上摆成了一个猫窝的形状。他先是盯着自己互相环绕着快速旋转的拇指，继而将他那噩梦般的脸抬起来对着金手指。他右眼皮的跳动停止了，两排牙齿摆出类似口技演员一样的口型。

“先生，”他在发b、p、m这几个音的时候有点困难，必须要把他的上唇先下伸覆盖到他的牙齿上，就好像一匹马从手上舔糖吃的样子，“我和我的朋友们很久以来就成为守法人士了。我的意思是说，让尸体在案发现场横七竖八躺一地的日子已经随着四十年代的结束一去不复返了。我和我的合伙人在女人、毒品、赛马这些方面都不缺，就算是我们有急需了，我们的好友联盟也不会袖手旁观的。你明白吧，先生——”“笑脸”将双手摊开了一下，又将它们放回到一个猫窝的形状，“我们觉得旧时光一去不复返了。大吉姆·克洛斯莫、强尼·托里奥、迪翁·奥班尼恩、艾尔·卡彭，这些人现在都到哪儿去了？先生，这些人就像篱笆上的牵牛花，转瞬即逝。可能当年我们还在密尔沃基后面的小波西米亚躲避打斗的时候您不在场。呵呵，先生，那个时候，打斗现场简直是枪林弹雨，你都分不清哪个是敌哪个是友。好吧，后来人们厌倦了这种方式——如果您能理解，我指的是那些还没有厌倦死亡的人——然后50年代到来，由我接管了队伍，大家一致同意摆脱这种爆竹生意一般危险的方式。现在怎么着，先生？现在您来了告诉我，我和我的朋友们都得来协助您引爆史上最大的爆竹！所以，您觉得我会怎么回答您的提议呢，呃……无名氏先生？好吧，我的答案是：每个人都有他的身价，对吧？既然报酬是十亿美元，我没有什么理由拒绝，我们会扔掉弹珠拿出弹弓，我们加入。”

“‘笑脸’，你小子把‘干’这个屁挤出来还真他妈费的劲不小。”米德奈特尖酸地说。

金手指诚挚地说：“非常感谢，林先生，您刚才的评论非常有意思。我要对您和您的合伙人致以最热烈的欢迎。索罗先生，您呢？”

索罗先生没有说话，而是先将手伸进衣服口袋，拿出一个电动剃须刀。他一打开开关，房间里立刻充斥了“嗡嗡”的声音，像飞来了一群愤怒的蜜蜂一样。索罗先生头朝后靠，若有所思地将剃须刀贴到自己的右脸上，眼睛向上望着屋顶，仿佛在艰难地做着决定。突然，他把剃须刀关掉，放在他面前的桌子上，猛地将头一低一扬，像一条蛇准备发起攻击一样。他那双黑色的眼睛就像一个黑黑的炮口，对准了桌子对面的金手指，在金手指那满月般的脸上仔细审视着，目光充满了威胁。索罗先生的脸现在一半是刮干净的，另一半上则长着黑黝黝的胡须，很像意大利人的肤色。邦德估计他每隔三四个小时就要刮一次胡子。

现在索罗先生打算开口说话了。他的嗓音让房间里所有人一下子冷静了下来。他柔声说：“先生，我一直在密切观察你。对于一个讲述一件意义如此重大事件的人来说，您表现得非常放松。好像斧头飞到面门都不慌不乱。好，好。”索罗先生向后挪了挪身子。他摊开手掌，好像有点儿不情愿的妥协的意思，“那么，我加入，这当然是没有问题。但是，先生——”他故意停顿了一下，以表示强调，“如果我拿不到那十亿美元，我就要取走您的性命。这您能接受吗？”

金手指的嘴角浮现出一丝讽刺的神色：“非常感谢，索罗先生。您提的条件当然是可以接受的。我会尽全力保住自己的生命的。赫尔穆特·斯普林格先生？”

斯普林格的眼神看起来比以往任何时候都更加呆滞，他傲慢地说：“我还没考虑好，再给我点儿时间，先问其他人的意见吧。”

米德奈特不耐烦地说：“还是那副德行，等着他所谓的灵感出现呢，他的一切行为都受到上帝的天使散播的信息指引。我估计这家伙二十年来都没听到过人类的声音了吧。”

“斯戴普先生，您呢？”

杰克·斯戴普朝金手指眨了眨眼，平静地说：“先生，我觉得您也了解成功的概率。我们在拉斯维加斯的工厂一直运营得很好，也在创造利润，但是您提供的利润显然更高。我想如果我们付出我们的力量与武力，一定会收到相应回报的。算我一个。”随后，这幅温柔可人的表情从斯戴普脸上消失了。他的眼神重新变得像以前一样凌厉，同金手指一起，盯着普西·葛罗尔。

葛罗尔低垂眼睑，让她那双紫色的眼睛得以避开这两个人的目光。她用有点儿冷漠的语气说：“近来我自己那块儿生意不是很兴隆。”她用自己那长长的，涂成银色的指甲在面前的金条上敲了敲，“不过先声明，我的经济状况也还没到去银行透支的地步。我们只是没有存款了。好，当然，我也加入，我和我的人都得吃饭呢。”

金手指脸上露出了一丝浅浅的微笑，似乎在表达他的同情：“这个消息真是太棒了，葛罗尔小姐。那么，现在，”他转头面对着桌子对面，“斯普林格先生，请问您做好决定了吗？”

斯普林格缓缓站起身来，像常去听歌剧的人一样打了一个很有克制的哈欠，随后又轻轻打了个嗝。他拿出一块精致的亚麻手帕，在嘴唇上轻轻沾了沾，然后那双呆滞无神的眼睛围着圆桌扫视了一圈，最后落在了金手指身上。他用缓慢的动作将头从一边转向另一边，好像在活动脖子上的肌肉似的。他用一种低沉的语气开了腔，当时的样子就像一个正在拒绝贷款给客户的银行经理：“金先生，恐怕我那些身在底特律的弟兄们不会对你的提议感兴趣。”他向在座的所有人鞠了一躬，“但是我还是要为能够参加这么精彩震撼的会议向您表示感谢，再会了，各位女士和先生们。”在一片死一般的寂静中，斯普林格将他的手帕小心翼翼地塞进了他那精致的细条纹西装左边袖子里，转身静静地走向门口，出去了。

随着“咣”的一声，门关上了。邦德注意到金手指不动声色地把手滑落到桌面以下，他估计“得力”现在已经收到信号了。这信号意味着斯普林格先生会遭到什么待遇呢？

米德奈特恶毒地说：“幸亏他退出了。这人可不是什么善茬。那么现在，”他轻快地站起来，转身面向邦德，“咱们喝一杯怎么样？”

所有人都站起来围在自助餐台周围。邦德就站在了普西·葛罗尔和蒂莉·玛斯特顿之间，他帮她们每人拿了一杯香槟。葛罗尔冷冷地看了他一眼，说：“请让开点儿，帅哥。我们女人们之间想说点儿私房话。是吧，美女？”

玛斯特顿小姐脸涨得通红，之后又变得惨白。她用崇拜的语气低声说：“哦，是啊，我很高兴，葛罗尔小姐。”

邦德朝蒂莉·玛斯特顿酸酸地笑了一下，朝会议室那头走过去了。

杰德·米德奈特目睹了邦德受到冷落的全过程。他凑到邦德身边，热心地说：“先生，如果那是你心仪的女郎，那你可得看好了她。普西什么样的女人都能弄到手，只要她喜欢。她那里女人多的是，跟葡萄似的，一串一串的，你明白吧？”米德奈特厌倦地叹了口气，“耶稣啊，那些女人们，她们简直让我烦透了。不信你等着看吧，她马上就会带着那名年轻女郎到镜子前面摆弄头发去了。”

邦德镇定地说：“我会当心的。但是我也控制不了什么，她是个相当独立的女人。”

“是吗？”米德奈特脸上突然闪现了一丝感兴趣的表情。“呵呵，没准儿我能帮你拆散她们呢。”他整理了一下领带，“我可以去追求那位玛斯特顿小姐，她还是很有魅力的。回见。”他朝邦德笑了笑，朝会议室那头走过去了。

邦德没吃鱼子酱也没喝咖啡，但也算是饱餐了一顿。他一边吃，一边回味着刚才金手指在开会期间的精彩表现。突然，会议室尽头的那扇门打开了，一个韩国人匆匆进来走到金手指身边。金手指低下头听了听韩国人小声说的话，脸色变得很难看。他用一把叉子在他手里那装着萨拉托加维希酒的杯子上敲了几下。

“各位女士以及先生们。”他悲伤地向四周环视了一圈，“我刚刚接到一个坏消息。我们的朋友赫尔穆特·斯普林格先生刚刚遭遇了一场意外。他从楼梯上摔下去了，当场死亡了。”

“嚯，嚯！”林似笑非笑，嘴巴张得圆圆的，像长在脸上的一个洞，“那么他带在身边的杀手捣蛋哈普古德对他的死会有什么看法呢？”

金手指脸色阴沉地说：“唉，哈普古德先生也不幸一起摔了下去，因伤势过重已经死亡了。”

索罗看了金手指一眼，目光里有着无比的崇敬，柔声说：“先生，您最好把你那台阶修修，以免我和我的朋友朱利奥重蹈覆辙。”

金手指严肃地说：“已经找到原因了。马上开始着手修理。”他脸上显现出沉思的表情，“我担心这场事故会被底特律的人们曲解。”

杰德·米德奈特漫不经心地说：“您不用担心这个，先生。他们那儿的人很喜欢参加葬礼的。况且这件事也会减轻他们思想上的负担。以前受的煎熬不复存在了。实际上在过去的12个月里，他们也一直在拨弄着在他身下炙烤的火苗呢。”他朝站在自己身边的斯戴普寻求着支持：“我说的没错吧，杰克？”

“当然了，杰德。”斯戴普一本正经地说，“你说对了，赫尔穆特·斯普林格先生落得个摔死的下场也是罪有应得。”

“摔死”——谋杀的代称。当晚邦德终于得以就寝的时候，这个词一直在他脑子里挥之不去。“得力”收到了信号，两声铃响，斯普林格先生和他的那名警卫就摔死了。整个过程中，邦德都显得无能为力——虽然他也没有真的想要起到什么帮助作用。斯普林格对他来说也确实什么意义都没有——可能某种意义上说也是罪有应得——但是现在的情况是，除非他能采取点什么措施，可能也只有他能采取点儿什么措施，否则还会有成千上万个无辜的人会被剥夺生命。

当峰会进行到每个与会成员都去各自履行自己义务的阶段时，金手指打发玛斯特顿小姐走开，让邦德继续留在房间里。他告诉邦德要做笔记，然后他们又用了两个多小时，将行动的每一个细节又重新过了一遍。

当他们讨论到在两个蓄水池中投放麻醉剂的问题时，（邦德需要计算出精确的时间来确保诺克斯堡的人们在恰当的时机“倒下”），邦德趁机询问了一下关于那种药物的一些细节问题以及它的见效速度。

“你不需要担心这个问题。”

“为什么？一切都取决于这个问题呢。”

“邦德先生，”金手指的目光显得深远而孤僻，“我来把真实情况告诉你吧，因为你根本没有机会将这个消息透露给任何人。从现在起，‘得力’将会不离你的左右，他会严格而精确地执行我的命令。所以我可以放心地告诉你，诺克斯堡的所有居民都会在第一天的午夜死亡，最轻也是丧失生活自理能力。即将投放到两个过滤水厂外的蓄水池里的是一种高浓度的甘氨酸甜菜碱。”

“你疯了吗！你不会真的要杀掉六万多条人命吧！”

“为什么不行呢？这个数字也就相当于美国两年中死于交通事故的人数。”

邦德死死地盯着金手指的脸，仿佛吓傻了一般。这是不可能的！他不可能是认真的！他紧张地说：“这个甘氨酸甜菜碱是什么东西？”

“甘氨酸甜菜碱是最强效的肾上腺皮素类神经麻醉剂，由纳粹德国国防军于1943年进行了进一步完善，但是由于担心受到报复从未投入使用。实际上，这是一种比氢弹更为有效的破坏性武器，缺点是很难将其使用于平民。俄国人在位于波兰边境的戴恒菲尔斯缴获了德国人所有的库存。我的一个朋友能够给我提供我所需要的剂量。通过饮用水作为介质是一种将其用于人口密集地区的理想方式。”

邦德说：“金手指，你真是个让人恶心的混蛋。”

“别孩子气了，我们还有正事要做呢。”

后来，当他们谈到将数吨重的黄金运出小镇的时候，邦德又做了最后的努力。他说：“金手指，你不能把这些黄金运走。不会有人具备将哪怕100吨黄金运出那个地方的能力，更何况是500吨呢。你这么做的结果只能是你那些装着金子的卡车把迪克西公路也给压垮了，美国军队能通过追踪卡车上装载的黄金发出的伽马射线将你抓获。而你愿意以六万条人命作为代价？这简直是荒唐无比。就算是你经过一番折腾弄走了那么一两吨，你觉得你他妈的能把那些金子藏到什么地方呢？”

“邦德先生，”金手指貌似有无穷的耐心，“恰好有一艘来自苏联斯维尔德罗夫斯克的巡洋舰要到诺福克、弗吉尼亚进行一次友好巡游。他们会于事发的第二天从诺福克出发。我的黄金可以先通过铁路，再通过车队运输，最后将于当天的午夜运达那只巡洋舰并装载上船。之后，我就会随船去往喀琅施塔得(1)。所有细节都已经精心计划好了，任何可能出现的意外情况也都提前考虑进去了。筹备这个计划占用了我过去整整五年的时间，现在终于到了付诸实践的时候。我已经清理了自己在英国以及欧洲的踪迹，不久之后肯定会有人探寻我的行踪，而那些遗留的蛛丝马迹就会将我暴露给他们。所以我必须要清理干净。事后我就会移民，并且，邦德先生，我要带上美国所有的黄金一起离开。当然了，”金手指轻描淡写道，“这个计划也不是绝对完美无缺的。我没有时间预先排练一下了。我需要借助这些笨蛋匪徒的枪支和人手。但是不到最后时刻我不能把他们牵涉到这个计划中来。他们肯定会犯错误。可想而知，他们想把赃物运走肯定不会那么顺利。有些会被逮捕，有些可能还会丢了小命。但是这跟我有什么关系呢？他们只是为了撑场面用来凑数的。邦德先生，这些人就像是从大街上拉来的临时演员。好戏落幕之后他们会是什么下场我一点儿都不关心。好吧，现在我们要继续工作了。天黑之前你需要把这个打出七份来给我。我们刚才说到哪儿了……”

那么，实际上，邦德兴奋地想，这不仅仅是金手指在“间谍之死”的指派下执行的一项任务。“间谍之死”在这项任务中也只是一个重要的棋子而已。这是一场俄国跟美国之间的搏斗，而金手指则是矛头！试图从其他国家盗窃是否也是一种战争行为呢？但是会有谁知道这些金子是被俄国人拿走了呢？如果一切如金手指计划的那样就永远不会有人知道。那些匪徒对于真实情况一点儿都不了解。在他们看来，金手指跟他们没有什么两样，也不过就是个恶棍而已，只不过比普通的恶棍势力更强大一些。那么金手指手下的人呢？帮他把黄金运往海岸的卡车司机、邦德本人，还有蒂莉·玛斯特顿这些人会是什么下场呢？一些人肯定性命难保，比如邦德和玛斯特顿小姐。另外的一些，比如那些韩国人，无疑会跟随金手指一起登上巡洋舰。他的身后不会留下任何蛛丝马迹，更不会有任何一个目击证人。这可以称得上是海盗掠夺的现代版。一如血腥摩根洗劫巴拿马(2)，金手指即将洗劫诺克斯堡。除了所使用的武器更加现代化，这两者之间可以说没有任何的区别。而现在，整个世界上却只有一个人能够阻止这一切。

但是怎么阻止呢？

第二天，成堆的文书工作像暴风雪一样袭来。每隔半个小时，金手指的行动指挥室就会送来各种指令，什么制定这个计划，打印那个资料，做估算，定时间表，或是整理什么库存清单之类的。另一台打字机、地图、相关书籍等——凡是邦德提出需要的东西都陆续地被送了进来。但是“得力”始终没有放松警惕。每次他进来送饭、传达指令或是送其他什么东西的时候，他那双警惕的眼睛都不会离开邦德的眼睛、手脚这些地方。毋庸置疑，邦德和玛斯特顿小姐属于这个团队的一部分，但是他们充其量也就是两个危险的奴隶。

蒂莉·玛斯特顿的情况也差不多，她就像一台机器一样工作着——快速、自愿、精准，但是一言不发。对于邦德跟她交流想法并尝试跟她交朋友的做法，她也都作出了礼貌的回应。到当天晚上为止，邦德仅仅了解到她曾经在联合利华公司做过秘书，并且在此期间还成了一个非常成功的业余滑冰运动员，从此之后开始进行冰上表演。她的爱好是室内手枪和步枪射击，并且她还加入了两个神枪手俱乐部。她朋友不多，从来没有恋爱过，更没有订过婚。她一个人住着厄尔斯考特的两间房子里。她今年24岁。当然，她也意识到了，他们现在陷入了很糟糕的处境。但是一定会有转机的，整个关于诺克斯堡的计划就是个天大的闹剧，是肯定行不通的。她觉得普西·葛罗尔小姐“美极了”。她甚至打算指望普西将她从这水深火热的处境中解救出去。一般来讲，女人具有敏锐的嗅觉，她们善于施展一些手段来解决问题。本能能够帮助她们做出正确的判断。邦德不需要担心她，她一定不会出事的。

最终，邦德得出一个结论：蒂莉·玛斯特顿体内的荷尔蒙已经彻底混乱了。他见过不少这样的女人。他认为她们以及那些男同性恋的存在都是因为提倡女子选举权以及“性平等”造成的结果。经过五十年来的女性解放运动，女子特质或者已经消亡，或者已经转化成了男子气概。两性之中这种情况都很常见，还不能确认就是同性恋，但是一种很混乱的状态，可能他们自己也不知道自己是什么。结果就是产生了诸多关系并不和谐的伴侣——没有成果的关系、充满坎坷的情路，女人妄图在感情中处于主导地位，而男人在感情中则是处于被照顾的被动地位。他为这些人感到悲哀，但是现在没有时间考虑这些了。邦德又想起了他们在卢瓦尔河畔顺着山谷行驶的时候自己对那女郎的诸般幻想，不禁苦笑了一下。

当天晚上，金手指送来了最后一个便条：

我与五位首领将于明天上午11∶00乘坐由“猛然一击”专用飞行员驾驶的包机离开拉瓜迪亚机场，你需陪同，玛斯特顿留守。金。

邦德坐在床边，看着墙壁。片刻之后他站起身来，走到打字机旁边。在接下来的一小时里，他用单倍行距，在纸的正反两面打印出了整个行动计划的每一个细节。之后，他将纸对折，卷成了一个跟他的小指差不多粗细的圆柱形小纸卷，仔细地用胶封好。又接着打印了一张小纸条：

紧急而且重要，请将此信息送至菲利克斯·莱特的凯尔私人侦探事务所，并保持密封状态，地址：纽约市拿骚大街154号。事成后奖励奖金5000美元，现金立结。

邦德将这个纸条卷在刚才那个纸卷外面，在表面用红笔写上5000美元奖金的字样，将这个小纸卷粘在长约三英寸的一条胶带中间。然后他再次在床边坐了下来，小心翼翼地将胶带贴在自己大腿的内侧。

第二十章　浩劫之旅


“先生，飞行控制中心发来信号，要求确认我们的身份，他们声称这属于控制领空。”

金手指站起身来，走向飞机驾驶舱。邦德见他拿起了手持式传声筒。他们所乘坐的10座飞机安静的机舱内很快传来了金手指清晰的声音。“上午好，我是派拉蒙影视公司的金先生。我们是来为即将拍摄的一部有关于1861年的联合突袭的A级电影进行实地考察。就是导致谢尔曼将军在马尔德劳山被捕的那次。对，没错，卡里·格兰特和伊丽莎白·泰勒主演。什么？通行证？我们当然有通行证了，让我找找看。（假装找了找）哦，在这儿呢。由五角大楼特别服务处的主管签发的。对，武装中心的指挥部有备份。好，多谢。希望你们喜欢这部电影。再见。”

说完之后，金手指脸上愉快的神色立刻消失殆尽，他挂掉了听筒，回到了机舱。他绷直双腿站着，低头看着飞机上的乘客们：“嗯，各位女士先生们，你们觉得看够了吗？我觉得现在局势很清晰，并且跟你们手上的行动计划也非常一致。我想将飞行高度控制在6000以上。我们再转上一圈，然后就可以离开了。‘得力’，拿点儿东西来给我们提提神。”

机舱里一片嘈杂，乘客们提出了一个又一个的问题，金手指都逐个回答了。“得力”从邦德身边的座位上站起来，向机尾走去。邦德跟在他身后，在他那双冷酷而又多疑的眼睛的注视下走进了洗手间，把门锁上了。

他镇定地坐着想：可惜在飞往拉瓜迪亚机场的路上没能找到机会。当时邦德跟“得力”一起坐在一辆不起眼的大别克轿车的最后面。车门紧锁，车窗紧闭。金手指坐在前面，后面的车窗也紧紧关闭着。“得力”坐在稍微靠边一点的位置，他那双长满老茧的手放在大腿上，像两只重重的大锤。在到达租机库登上那架私人飞机之前，他那双眼睛始终都没有离开过邦德。邦德被夹在金手指和“得力”之间，他别无选择，只好沿着悬梯登上了飞机，挨着“得力”坐了下来。十分钟后，其他人也都到了。他们之间也只是简单地打了个招呼，就不再交谈了。他们都和开会的时候判若两人了，不再尖锐地进行评论，也没有了闲言碎语。现在，这些人俨然是一群即将上战场的士兵，就连普西·葛罗尔也穿上了黑色的涤纶防水衣，系了一根黑色皮带，那模样活像一名年轻的禁卫军军官。

在飞机上，有那么一两次她若有所思地向邦德转过头来专注地看着，但是面对邦德的微笑她并没有做出回应。可能她关注邦德只是因为她不明白邦德是什么人，来这是干什么的吧。等他们回拉瓜迪亚机场的时候，估计情况也还是一样。要么现在寻找机会，要么就永远不会有机会了，但是机会在哪里呢？把密信夹在厕所的卫生纸里吗？但是这里的不确定性太大，也许很快就被人发现了，但也许几个星期也没人把它翻得出来。那么烟灰缸里呢？可能也不行，但是有一个地方可以。

突然，厕所的门把手开始“嘎嘎”地抖动起来。“得力”已经等得不耐烦了。说不定邦德正在飞机上放火呢。邦德喊了一声：“来了，大猩猩。”他站起来，将座位抬了起来。他从大腿内侧把胶带撕了下来，塞到了座位前侧的下面。要使用马桶，这个座位是必须要抬起来的，所以飞机一进机库，肯定就会马上有人发现这个纸条的。那“悬赏5000美元”的字样相当显眼，不管清洁工是多草率的人也不可能看不见。要是在清洁工来之前没有其他人发现就好了。但是邦德觉得其他乘客是不会将这个座位抬起的。这个小隔间太狭窄了，任何人都没法舒服地站在里面。他将座位轻轻放下，在洗手盆里放了一点儿水，洗了洗脸，整理了一下头发，就出去了。

在外面等候的“得力”看起来很生气，他一把将邦德推到一边，仔细地将厕所查看了一遍才又出来了，然后把门关好了。邦德回到了自己的座位。现在密信已经装进了瓶子，也扔进了大海，将来捡到这个漂流瓶的会是什么人呢？那一刻什么时候到来呢？

在飞机着陆前，每个人，包括飞机的驾驶员和副驾驶员都去了一遍厕所。每一个人出来的时候，邦德都会幻想自己脖子后面被冷冷的枪口顶着，听到严厉的质疑声或是纸条被拆开时发出的“咯吱咯吱”的声音。但是最后，这些都没有发生，他们都顺利地上了那辆别克车，穿过了三区，进入了曼哈顿的住宅区，然后沿着河边的林荫大道继续行驶，最后驶进了那个仓库严加把守的大门，回到了他们工作的地方。

现在，一场竞赛开始了——一场金手指的镇静、从容不迫、高效的机器与邦德点燃的一根小小的引线之间的竞赛。外面的情况怎么样了呢？在接下来的三天里，邦德无时无刻不在想象外面可能发生的情况——莱特通知了他的长官，开会，以最快的速度飞往华盛顿，联邦调查局以及胡佛局长，军队，总统。莱特坚持支持邦德，认为应该先按兵不动，不要打草惊蛇，先制定一个可行的大计划，时机成熟的时候再一举采取行动，将敌人一网打尽。

他们会接受邦德的建议吗？或许他们根本不敢冒这个风险呢？他们是否跟大洋彼岸的M通过话了呢？M有没有提出要不惜一切代价将邦德救出呢？不会，M一定会明白其中的道理。他一定也会同意邦德将自己的生命置之度外的做法，应该以大局为重。当然了，他们必须要抓住那两个“日本人”，不管用什么方式，让他们供出金手指在行动第一天等候的密码代号。真实情况是这样的吗？又或者事情进行的根本没有这么顺利？莱特有可能正在外地执行其他的任务。“这个007是什么人？这代码代表什么？没准是个脑子有病的吧。嗨，史密斯，你查查这事儿，可以吗？去那个什么仓库看一眼。不好意思，先生，我们不能提供什么5000美元的赏金，只能给您提供返回拉瓜迪亚的路费，恐怕您是上当受骗了。”甚至，情况有可能更糟糕，这些情节根本一个都没有发生。没准儿到现在为止，那架飞机还在机场的某个角落停放着，根本没人去打扫过呢？

日复一日，夜复一夜，当手头的工作处理清楚，时钟的指针“滴答滴答”匆匆走过，那台死亡机器又在静静旋转的时候，邦德不断地受到这些想法的折磨。

行动的第一天终于到来，又随着一大堆的工作与活动匆匆过去。到晚上的时候，金手指又送来了字条：

行动第一阶段成功。按照原计划今天午夜登上火车。随身携带各种地图、日程表、行动指令等复印件。金。

关于服装打扮方面，邦德按照要求穿上了外科医生的白大褂，而蒂莉则是扮成了一名护士，金手指夹在他们之间，脚步轻快地穿过了几乎空无一人的宾夕法尼亚车站广场，到达了贵宾候车室。包括金手指在内的每一个人都穿着白大褂，戴着军医的袖标，昏暗的站台上挤满了幽灵一般候车的人群。当时寂静而紧张的气氛跟一只救援队伍奔赴灾难现场的场景非常的相配。而即将登上火车的那些人身上穿着的雪白的长褂也给车厢增添了一些戏剧色彩。监督员正在跟米德奈特、斯戴普、索罗、林这些假扮成主治医师的人小声说着什么。葛罗尔小姐则站在附近，身边围绕着十几个护士，这些人脸色苍白，目光低垂，好像站在一所打开的墓穴旁边似的。她们都没有化妆，发型富有异国风情，头上戴着深蓝色的红十字会帽子。显然之前她们进行了很好的演练，她们的举止非常符合她们假扮的身份——负责、慈善、投身于救民于水火的事业。

监督员见金手指与众人走近，匆匆赶了过来。“金？”他脸色很凝重，“刚刚收到的消息，情况恐怕不太顺利。估计今晚会见报。所有火车都滞留在路易斯维尔了，收不到任何诺克斯堡车站的消息。不过我们会想办法将您送到的。全能的上帝啊！医生，那边出了什么事儿？从路易斯维尔来的人说俄国人在那边的空气中喷洒了什么东西。当然了，”监督员真诚地望着金手指说，“我不相信有这种事。但是到底是出了什么事啊？食物中毒吗？”

金手指脸上一副严肃的表情。他用很和善的语气说：“朋友，我们去那里就是要把那里的情况查清楚，这也是为什么我们这么着急的原因。如果您想听听我的猜测的话——我必须得提醒您这只是猜测，这可能是一种睡眠障碍，我们称之为锥虫病。”

“这么回事啊？”监督员仿佛恍然大悟，“好，请您相信我，医生，我们都为您和您的急救团队感到无比的自豪。”他向金手指伸出手，金手指伸手握了握。“祝您好运，医生；那么现在，一旦您的人上车，我一定会尽全力以最快的速度将你们送到的。”

“太感谢了，监督员先生。我和我的同事不会忘记您的帮助。”

金手指微微鞠了一躬。他的人开始行动了。

“上车！”

邦德和蒂莉·玛斯特顿的座位隔着通道相对着，那些韩国人和德国人都分布在他们的周围。金手指在前面的车厢里，正愉快地与他的合伙人们交谈着。普西·葛罗尔小姐大步走了过来，没有理会蒂莉·玛斯特顿仰视的目光，而是以一贯审视的目光看着邦德。“咣”一声门关上了。普西·葛罗尔站在邦德面前，将一只胳膊搭在邦德前面那个座位的椅背上。

她低头看着邦德，说：“你好，帅哥，好久不见了。大叔好像让你从领导集团退出啦。”

邦德说：“你好，美女，这身衣服挺适合你啊。正好我有点儿头晕，你来照顾照顾我怎么样？”

普西那双深紫色的眼睛仔细地审视了邦德一会儿，轻声说：“你知道吗，邦德先生？我总感觉到你身上有些不可信的东西。我直觉很灵的，知道吗？直说吧，你跟那个妞儿——”她的头向后偏了偏，“扮成这样到底要干什么？”

“该干什么干什么呗。”

火车开动了。普西·葛罗尔站直了身子，说：“没准儿你说的是真的。但是如果这场恶作剧出了什么差错的话，帅哥你肯定知道是为什么。你明白我的意思吧？”她没有等邦德回答，就沿着通道向前走去，加入到各位首领们的讨论中去了。

那一晚又忙又乱。在那些好打听而又同情心泛滥的列车员面前，时时刻刻都要保持伪装——禁止吸烟、禁止骂人、禁止吐痰，各帮派之间的仇恨与嫉妒都受到了很好的克制。

黑手党表现出冷冷的优越感，尤其是在斯戴普和他那些来自西部性格随和而又随遇而安的手下面前，这种优越感表现得更为明显。如果不是首领们对于可能出现的麻烦都做好了充分的准备，并且时时保持着警惕，枪战都不知道爆发了多少次了。而金手指提前预见到了这所有细微的心理因素，并做好了相应的准备。来自“混凝土搅拌车”的那十几名女子也都被细心地隔离起来。整列火车上没有人喝酒，各位首领都忙着进一步发布精确的指令，组织自己的人在地图上进行演练，并且进一步讨论着拿到黄金之后的逃脱计划。帮派之间时不时地也会刺探彼此的计划，金手指也常常介入，评判着哪支队伍应该逃往墨西哥边界、哪支应该逃往沙漠地带或是加拿大。在邦德看来，美国一百多名最难缠的恶棍，在极度的兴奋与贪欲的驱使之下，竟然还能保持着这样的镇静和秩序，这简直是个奇迹，而创造这个奇迹的正是金手指。除了这个人身上所具备的镇静而危险的特质之外，更是他细致入微的计划以及无时无刻不在流露出来的自信抚慰着这些乌合之众那紧绷的神经，甚至在他们中间创造出了某种团队意识。

列车向着宾夕法尼亚平原深处疾驰而去，乘客们也渐渐地迷迷糊糊睡了过去。但是金手指和“得力”都没有入睡。他们一直保持着清醒、警惕的状态。本来邦德还打算在火车进站或是上坡路段降低车速的时候趁其不备用鞋底藏着的匕首刺杀“得力”呢，现在他也不得不放弃了这个念头。

邦德断断续续小睡了一会儿，在清醒的时候，他一次又一次地回味着、想象着车站监督员的话，总感觉到有点儿困惑。显然，监督员对他们的话信以为真了，知道诺克斯堡出现了紧急情况。那么他那来自路易斯维尔的消息是真实的吗？或者只是编造出来好将整个阴谋集团吸引过去一网打尽的呢？如果是编造的消息，那么他们的故事编造的精巧程度如何呢？执行过程中会不会出什么岔子呢？又会不会有人犯些低级错误，让金手指提早察觉呢？或者，如果这个消息根本就是真实的呢？如果城里的居民都已经中毒了。那对于邦德来说，还有什么可以采取的行动吗？

邦德决心要拼死一搏。在攻击发起的那一刻，他要想方设法接近金手指，用他鞋底藏着的匕首割断他的喉咙。但是这么做除了实现了个人的复仇以外还有什么别的意义吗？金手指的队伍会不会接收到更高领导的指令，武装了核弹头然后将其引爆呢？那么剩下的人里谁有能力接替他的工作呢？索罗？很有可能。行动也有可能会只成功一半，他们会带着很多的黄金离开——但是失去了金手指的领导，他手下那些人就被留在后面乱作一团了。此时此刻，暂时放下那些邦德无力左右的因素不去考虑吧，那里的六万多人都已经死去了吗？当初是不是他也能采取点什么行动阻止这一切发生呢？他是不是也曾经错过了杀掉金手指的机会呢？如果在宾夕法尼亚车站大闹一场的话会不会对情况有什么帮助？邦德盯着自己在窗户里黑黑的影子，听着火车通过路口时传来的悦耳的铃声以及开路的号角哀号的声音，任凭各种疑虑、质疑、责备的情绪将自己的神经肆意蹂躏着。





第二十一章　世上最富有的人


天边慢慢地露出一丝红色的曙光，随着太阳逐渐升高，那一望无际的黑色的草原逐渐摆脱了阴暗的笼罩，呈现出了著名的肯塔基蓝。六点整，火车开始慢慢放慢速度，他们从刚刚苏醒的路易斯维尔郊区穿过，随着一声叹息般的排气声，火车在那空旷的、荒漠般的车站停靠了下来。

一小群人正在恭恭敬敬地等候他们的到来。由于缺乏睡眠，金手指的黑眼圈非常明显，他召唤了一下其中的一个德国人，拿起他那象征着权威的黑色小包，踏上了站台。路易斯维尔的车站管理员面带严肃的表情，简短地跟金手指交谈了一会儿。金手指不时地插话问了几个问题，然后又面色凝重地听着管理员的回答。过后，金手指疲倦地回到了火车上。索罗站在火车最后一节车厢打开的门口，听着金手指带回来的消息。邦德听见金手指忧愁地说：“医生，恐怕实际情况跟我们预想的一样糟糕，我现在要去车头传达这个消息了。”他将手里的黑包举起，“我们接下来要慢慢进入感染区域。麻烦您通知我们所有的工作人员，随时准备好戴上防毒面具，我也为司机和消防人员准备好了防毒面具，其他铁路工作人员请从这里撤离火车。”

索罗先生严肃地点了点头：“好的，教授。”他把门关好。金手指在他那健壮的德国人以及一群恭恭敬敬、不断摇头的人跟随之下，走下了站台。

火车经过短暂的停留之后，几乎悄无声息地开出了车站，将几个工作人员留在了车站。那四个列车员脸上带着羞愧的表情，双手举起，做出为他们祈福的姿势。

还有35英里，大概半个小时的路程。“护士”们将咖啡和甜甜圈分发给众人，并且给那些需要振奋精神的人每人发了两粒安非他命（金手指考虑的真是周到）。“护士”们脸色苍白，也没有多少话语。没有人开玩笑，也没有人说俏皮话。

那列火车是由电驱动的。

10分钟后，车速突然降低，刹车发出了刺耳的“嘶嘶”声。人们手里端着的咖啡都洒了出来，火车几乎完全停了下来。突然火车又猛地一颤，开始加速了，一只手从死亡的司机手中接管了控制杆。

又过了几分钟，斯戴普先生从车厢中匆匆穿过：“10分钟后到达目的地！准备行动，伙计们！A、B、C各小组拿好武器。一切顺利。保持镇静，将自己的职责牢记于心。”他又匆匆地走向下一节车厢，邦德听到他在那边把这些话又重复了一遍。

邦德转身面向“得力”：“听着，你这大猩猩。我得去趟厕所，玛斯特顿小姐估计也想去了。”他转向玛斯特顿说：“是吧，蒂莉？”

“对，”她漠然地说，“我最好也去一趟。”

邦德说：“好，那走吧。”

坐在蒂莉旁边的韩国人面带询问的表情看着“得力”，“得力”摇了摇头。

邦德说：“你最好让她去，否则我就动手了。金手指可不希望发生这样的事。”他对蒂莉说：“你去吧，我看着这些大猩猩。”

“得力”又叫又嚷地吵闹了一通，其他的那些韩国人好像听懂了他说什么似的。守卫站起来，说：“好吧，但是不许锁门。”然后，他跟随蒂莉走到车厢尽头的厕所，站在门外等她出来。

“得力”也同样盯着邦德去了厕所。一到厕所里面，邦德就脱下鞋来，从鞋底将隐藏的那把匕首抽出来，插在裤子的腰带里。这样他的其中一只鞋子就没有后跟了，但是今天上午不会有人注意到的。邦德洗了洗脸。镜子里面，邦德的脸色显得有点儿苍白，那双灰蓝色的眼睛显现出紧张的神色。随后，邦德走出厕所，回到了自己的座位上。

此刻，火车右侧远远的地方出现几点昏暗的灯光，几座不太高的房子出现在清晨的薄雾中，如海市蜃楼一般。渐渐地，这些建筑物的轮廓清晰起来，是飞机库以及一座矮矮的控制塔。是戈德曼机场！火车的车速减慢了，一些排列整齐的现代村庄从车窗略过，但看样子好像这些村庄里并没有居民。布莱登堡车站路像一条黑色的丝带出现在火车左侧。邦德向外探出头去张望着。诺克斯堡在清晨薄雾的笼罩中若隐若现。然而在薄雾以上，空气则像水晶一样的纯净，没有一丝烟。说明没有人做早饭！车速现在越来越慢，车站路上发生了一起严重的交通事故，好像是两辆汽车迎面相撞了。一扇撞坏了的车门外露出了半截尸体，另一辆车则像一只死掉的甲壳虫一样底盘朝上地躺在地上。邦德的心脏不仅“砰砰”地狂跳了起来。主信号塔也从车窗外掠了过去，控制杆上搭着一件白色的东西，是一件男士衬衫。

衬衫里套着的是一具尸体。尸体的头部低垂着，在车窗以下看不见的高度。再往前是一排现代的平房，一具身穿单衣单裤的尸体脸朝下趴在一边刚刚修剪过的草坪中间。尸体身后的草坪修剪得非常整齐，而在尸体附近，割草机在草地上画出了一团乱七八糟的痕迹，之后在草坪的边缘部位一片新翻的泥土上翻倒了。旁边，一具女人的尸体躺在一堆白色的衣服和毛巾之上，显然是晾衣绳被这女人扯断了，衣服都掉了下来。车速越来越慢，现在已经和人步行的速度差不多了。它带着一车人穿过了城区里的大街小巷，处处都能看见各种姿势的尸体——有单个的，也有成群的，有的还躺在门廊上的摇椅里。马路上的交通信号灯还在不紧不慢地变换着颜色，路上的行人有的在死亡之前将车停了下来，有的则任凭汽车撞上了商店的橱窗。死亡！遍地都是死人。四处一片沉寂、静止，没有什么能够阻止这谋杀者的铁蹄。

车厢里开始喧闹起来。比利·林满面笑容地走了过来，站在邦德的座位边说：“哦，天啊！”他兴奋地说，“老金已经下药把他们迷倒了！那些发作的时候在开车的真是些倒霉蛋。但是你知道，这就像那句名言：不打碎几颗蛋怎么做得成鸡蛋卷？对吧？”

邦德挤出了一丝笑容，说：“说得没错。”

比利·林张开嘴无声地笑了笑，继续向前走过去了。

火车开进了布莱登堡车站。这里更是充斥了各种各样的尸体——男人、女人、孩子、士兵……站台上满是横七竖八、姿势各异的尸体，仰卧的、俯卧的，还有侧卧的。邦德仔细搜寻着还有没有移动的迹象，好奇的目光，抽搐的手。没有！等等！那是什么？从紧闭的车窗外传来几声类似猫叫的微弱的哭声。原来是售票室外面停着的三辆婴儿车，孩子的母亲们已经在婴儿车旁边倒下了。是啊！车里的婴儿，喝的是奶，而不是那致命的毒水。

“得力”站起来，金手指的人也跟着全都站了起来。那些韩国人脸上还是一贯的冷漠表情，他们的眼睛像紧张的动物一样不断地眨着。

那些德国人的脸色苍白，表情冷酷，他们都不与人对视。他们一言不发地向出口走过去，排起了队，等候着。

蒂莉·玛斯特顿碰了碰邦德的袖子，用颤抖的声音说：“他们真的只是睡着了吗？我好想看见他们嘴角有……有泡沫。”

邦德也注意到了这个现象，那是一种粉红色的泡沫。他说：“我想是他们发作的时候正在吃什么东西吧。你也知道的，这些美国人——他们嘴里总是嚼着点儿什么。”紧接着他又小声补充说，“离我远点，一会儿可能会有人开枪射击。”为了让她理解他还特意使了个眼色。

她麻木地点了点头，并没有抬头看他，小声嘟囔着：“我去找普西，她会保护我的。”

邦德朝她笑了笑，说：“好。”

火车经过了减速带，慢慢停了下来。随着猛地一声汽笛响，门打开了，片刻之间，美国金库铁路侧线的站台上站满了从火车上下来的人群。

每个人的行动都符合军人那精准的标准。几个小队组成了战斗队列——最前面是拿着冲锋枪的先锋，紧随其后的是负责将守卫和其他工作人员转移出金库的担架手队伍（邦德想，现在看来，他们的工作根本没有任何意义），再后面是金手指的破拆小队——十个人，全部都穿了防水帆布衣——再后面是一群司机以及交通指挥人员，最后是护士编队，现在这些护士也都装备了手枪，她们将和另一组全副武装的后备队一起准备应对任何意料之外的情况，也就是金手指所谓的“万一醒过来”。

邦德和蒂莉·玛斯特顿被夹在了指挥小组中间，其成员有金手指、“得力”以及那五名帮派首领。他们被安置在两个火车头的顶上。按照之前的安排，这两个火车头已经停在了车站建筑物以外的地方，视野开阔。邦德和蒂莉负责地图、时间表以及秒表这些东西。除此之外，邦德还需要注意观察，一旦出现任何的失误或延迟，需要第一时间报告给金手指，好让他通过恰当的方式加以校正。炸弹点燃的那一刻，他们就在火车头后进行躲避。

火车的汽笛鸣了两声，邦德和蒂莉爬到了第一个火车头顶上。先锋队打头，队伍的其他部分紧随其后，走上了铁路和黄金大道之间那长20码的空地。邦德尽量地靠近金手指。金手指正拿着一副双筒望远镜放在眼前，嘴对着一个别在胸前的话筒。但是，“得力”站在他们之间，像一座血肉做成的山峰，他的那双眼睛对整个这场闹剧都完全不感兴趣，而是死死地盯着邦德和蒂莉。

邦德假装查看了一下他的塑料地图套子，又盯着秒表看了一会儿，实则暗暗地计算着距离和角度。他看了看旁边的四男一女，他们正在十分专注地看着眼前的情景。杰克·斯戴普兴奋地说：“他们已经穿过第一道大门了。”邦德一边琢磨着自己的计划，一边匆匆朝战场看了一眼。

那场面真是非同寻常。金库耸立在空地中间，像一座巨大的陵墓，那花岗岩堆砌的高墙上洒满了阳光。空地以外的几条道路上——迪克西高速公路、葡萄园路、黄金大道——停满了汽车、卡车等各种各样的交通工具，在每个车队的头车和尾车上还插着各帮派的旗子以示区别。卡车司机都躲在金库警戒墙外，从火车上下来的训练有素的各支小队正从大门口进入金库。除了这些人的动作之外，四周是绝对的沉寂和静止，似乎整个美国都屏住了呼吸，目睹着这场惊天大案的实施。金库外面随处可见士兵的尸体——倒在药箱旁边的哨兵手里还紧握着自动手枪，高墙内倒着的两支小队的士兵身上穿着褴褛的迷彩服。这些尸体横七竖八，有的还压在旁边的尸体上面。墙外，在黄金大道与大门之间的位置，两辆装甲车相撞了，互相卡在了那里，两辆车上的机枪一挺对着天，一挺对着地。其中一辆的炮塔上还垂着一个司机的尸体。

邦德近乎绝望地在搜寻着任何生命的迹象，任何移动的迹象，任何能够证明所有这一切都是一场精心的埋伏的迹象。但是没有找到！四下里连一只活动的猫都看不见，作为整个场景背景的拥挤的大楼里也没有传出任何声音。眼前只有那些恶棍们或者匆匆忙忙正在执行任务或者静静等待的身影。

金手指对着他的话筒小声说：“最后一只担架已经撤出。爆破小队准备接替。”

现在，担架小队和掩护小队都匆匆向出口撤退，到达警戒墙下进行躲避。爆破小队已经在大门口待命，只需再用五分钟清理场地，之后，他们就可以进入了。

邦德说：“他们比计划提前了一分钟。”

金手指的目光越过“得力”的肩膀，向邦德看了过来。那苍白的眼睛里满是兴奋的神色。他的嘴唇扭曲着，发出一声类似怒吼的声音，他从牙缝里挤出来这么几句话：“你看，邦德先生。事实证明你错了，我是对的。只要再过十分钟，我就成了这世界上最有钱的人了，也是有史以来最有钱的人！你还有什么可说的吗？”那语气听起来恶狠狠的。

邦德也用同样的语气说：“等这十分钟过去之后我会给你个答案的。”

“你会吗？”金手指说，“也许吧。”他低头看了看手表，开始对着话筒果断地发布了命令。金手指的人从大门口慢慢撤了出来，四个人的肩膀上还挎着担架的带子。

金手指看着邦德身后另一个车厢顶上的那几个人，得意扬扬地喊：“再过五分钟先生们，我们就得手了。”他又将目光落在邦德身上，轻声说：“到时候我们就该说再见了。谢谢你和你那女郎给我提供的帮助。”

突然，邦德眼睛的余光好像看到了什么东西在移动——天空中的什么东西。是一个盘旋的黑点儿。那个黑点儿一直上升，到达它的轨迹的最高点之后停顿了一下，继而发出了一声震耳欲聋的炸裂声。是一颗绛紫色的信号弹。

邦德的心脏狂跳起来。他朝四周匆匆一瞥，发现那些士兵的尸体突然全部复活了，那两辆装甲车上的机枪已经对准了大门。不知从什么地方传来了扩音器的声音：“站住，不许动。放下武器。”金手指的后卫部队中只传来了两声零星的枪响，就完全溃败了下来。

邦德搂住蒂莉的腰，带着她跳下了车顶。

他们大概跳下了十英尺高，落到站台上。邦德用左手缓冲了一下落地时的冲击力，又用胯将蒂莉向上一顶，保证她的双脚轻轻落地。落地之后，他赶紧跑到离火车近一点的地方来寻求躲避。这时，他听到金手指大喊：“抓住他们，杀了他们。”金手指的自动手枪射出来的一颗子弹打在邦德左边的水泥地上，但金手指左手开枪对邦德构不成威胁，他真正怕的是“得力”。邦德赶紧抓紧蒂莉的手沿着站台向前跑去，他听到身后已经有脚步声快速追上来。

蒂莉的手奋力挣扎着，她愤怒地大喊：“不，不，放开！我要找普西，她才能保证我的安全。”

邦德怒斥：“闭嘴！你这小傻瓜！快跑！”但是蒂莉根本不听，她又拖又拉，严重影响了邦德的速度。突然，她挣脱了邦德的手，飞似的跑进了一扇敞开着的火车车厢门。“天啊！”邦德心想，“这下完蛋了！”他赶紧从腰带里拔出匕首，转身迎战“得力”。

身后十码远的地方，“得力”追赶的脚步没有丝毫放松。他单手将那顶滑稽而又致命的帽子拿在手中，目光一瞥对准了目标，随后一个黑色半圆形的影子飞了过来。帽子不偏不倚，正中蒂莉的后颈。她吭都没吭一声，就向后倒在了“得力”面前的站台上。此刻“得力”正飞起一脚踢向邦德的头部，蒂莉倒下的身体正好阻挡了他的动作。他马上收回动作改为一跃而起，同时左手像一把利剑向邦德刺去。邦德赶忙低头躲避，同时将手中的匕首向斜上方一挥挡了上去。匕首正好顶到“得力”的肋骨，但是那一跃而起的身体却将匕首从他手中击落了，“叮”的一声落在站台上。

显然，“得力”并没有受到任何伤害。他双臂张开，双脚分开站立，做好再踢或再次跃起的准备。他热血沸腾，眼睛变得血红，嘴巴张开喘着粗气，一条口水垂在嘴边。

车站外面枪声响成一片，在这嘈杂的背景中，三声响亮的汽笛声显得尤其刺耳。“得力”怒吼一声，再次跃起。邦德拼尽全力朝旁边躲避。他感觉自己的肩膀受到了重重的一击，随后就仰面躺在地上了。落地的那一刻，他想：“这下死定了！”他一边笨拙地挣扎着爬了起来，一边将头低到胸前试图缓冲“得力”新的一击即将产生的冲击力。然而，“得力”并没有再发起攻击，邦德恍惚中看见“得力”的身体从他面前飞起，离开了站台。

原来，火车头已经开动了。“得力”飞身一跃，跳上了踏板。

他先是在空中悬了一会儿，双腿乱蹬寻找着踏板，之后，他就进入了车厢，那巨大的流线型的火车头就开始加速了。

邦德身后的指挥官办公室的门“砰”的一声突然打开了。紧接着是重重的奔跑的脚步声，还有一个人大喊一声：“圣地亚哥！”——圣詹姆斯，这是莱特有一次在科特斯开玩笑地分配给邦德的战斗口号。

邦德转身一看，一个身穿美国海军陆战队战时军服，头发像枯草一样的德克萨斯人正在站台上朝他走来，身后跟着十几个身穿卡其布军服的士兵。这人没有右手，右臂上手的位置是一个铁钩，上面勾着一个单兵火箭筒。邦德飞奔过去，说：“别射杀了我的猎物，你个混蛋。给我！”他从莱特手里一把把火箭筒抢过来，双腿岔开，蹲在站台上。火车头已经开出去200码远了，马上就要越过迪克西高速公路上面的高架桥。

邦德大喊一声：“闪开！”提醒人们离开爆炸能够影响到的区域，打开保险，仔细地对准目标。火箭筒开始轻微地振动起来，继而，随着一道刺眼的光线和一阵蓝色的烟雾，这颗十磅的穿甲弹射了出去，飞行轨迹上落下来一些金属的碎片。然而，火车头跨过大桥之后，转了个弯，逃脱了。

“对于一个新手来说表现得还不错。”莱特评论着，“如果没有那个弯的话，本来可能会打到后面那个车厢的，顺便牵连到前面那个。”

邦德站起身来。他看着莱特那双灰蓝色像鹰一样的眼睛笑了。“笨蛋呆子，”他尖酸地说，“你怎么会没想到提前把那铁路截断呢？”

“听我说，警官。您如果对部署指挥有什么意见的话，请您直接找总统先生谈。本次行动是由他亲自指挥的，而且部署得无懈可击。现在我们的上空就有一架侦察机。他们会负责追踪那辆火车头。预计今天中午我们就可以将老金捉拿归案了。”他停了一下，在邦德的两个肩胛骨之间打了一拳。“妈的，能再见到你真是太高兴了。我们这些人都是被派来专门保护你的。我们四处追查你的下落，两面夹击受尽了苦楚。”他转身对身后的士兵说，“我说的没错吧，伙计们？”

他们大笑着说：“没错，长官。”

邦德深情地望着这个曾经多次与他共患难的德克萨斯人，严肃地说：“上帝保佑你，菲利克斯。你不知道救过我多少次了，这次真是生死关头啊。只是恐怕蒂莉·玛斯特顿是救不回来了。”他跟在菲利克斯身后朝火车走去。蒂莉那娇小的身躯还躺在她倒下的地方，邦德在她身边单膝跪地。她头上受到的是致命一击，邦德摸了摸她的脉搏，站起身来，轻声说：“可怜的小妞儿，她怎么不相信男人呢？”他心存戒备地看了莱特一眼，说：“菲利克斯，如果她愿意跟着我的话也不会落得这个下场。”

莱特没有理解邦德的意思。他抓住邦德的胳膊说：“是啊，伙计，节哀吧。”他转身向他的手下命令：“来两个人将这女子抬到总指挥办公室。奥布莱恩，叫救护车。然后去指挥部，向他们报告。告诉他们我们找到邦德先生了，马上带他过去。”

邦德低头看着地上蒂莉那纷乱的四肢和衣服。眼前仿佛还浮现着那个开着凯旋TR3，头戴波点丝巾、靓丽而又骄傲的女郎的身影。然而现在，已经是香消玉殒了。

就在他的头顶上方，一个黑点儿盘旋着冲上云霄，到达高度后停了下来。然后，伴随着一声脆响，一股绛紫色的烟雾释放出来，是停火信号。





第二十二章　最后的诡计


两天之后，菲利克斯·莱特开着他那辆黑色的轿车在三区大桥慢吞吞的车流中间快速穿行着。邦德要乘坐今晚从默纳克飞往伦敦的海外航班，本来时间很充裕，但是莱特对邦德关于美国车的偏见一向不服气。他那铁钩做的右手将档杆拉到了二档的位置，他那低矮的黑色小车“嗖”的一声窜进了一辆大型冷藏保温车和一辆发黄的奥斯莫比之间狭窄的空隙中。300马力的发动机使邦德的身体猛地撞向靠背，牙齿差点没咬到舌头。超车完成，被超车辆愤怒的喇叭声被甩在了身后。邦德温和地说：“是时候扔掉你那老爷车，买辆跑得动的好车了。你不是想享受速度吗？你这辆简直跟脚踏车没什么区别。要是再过几年你就跑不动了，到时候离死也就不远了。”

莱特大笑起来，说：“看见前边的绿灯了吗？变红之间我就能冲过去。”

车好像一个被人踢了一脚的皮球似的，猛地向前一窜。迈速表显示了90，邦德感觉时间仿佛停止了，自己像鸟一样飞了起来。片刻之间汽车已经窜出了100码的距离，在莱特按响的喇叭呼啸声中，越过了亮着绿灯的路口，然后又沿着中间的车道正常行驶了。

邦德镇定地说：“一会儿碰见个呆头呆脑的交通警察，告诉你持有的私人侦探驾照不太适合你。你不仅自己开得慢，还挡住了后面要找你办案的客户。你应该换辆车，比如一辆有大玻璃窗的老式劳斯莱斯银精灵，这样就可以不慌不忙地欣赏美丽的自然风光了。”邦德指了指他们右边的一辆老爷车：“最高时速50英里，更妙的是你还能随时停车甚至倒车。球形喇叭，跟您端庄的风格多么相配啊！知道吗？二手车市场上马上就会有一辆这样的车出售啦——金手指那辆。说起来了，金手指现在到底什么情况？抓到了吗？”

莱特看了一眼手表，靠向了右边的车道，他将车速降到40，表情严肃地说：“情况是这样的，我们都有点儿担心。媒体的报道都快让我们抓狂了，尤其是埃德加·胡佛的人。首先，他们咬住没能保障你的安全问题不放。我们都没有办法解释清楚这不是我们的责任。还有个伦敦的英国佬，坚持要求召回你，说什么我们办事不力什么什么的。坦白告诉你吧，詹姆斯，”莱特显得有点儿闷闷不乐又略带歉意，“我们现在一点儿线索都没有。我们的人后来追上火车头了，但是金手指已经把行驶速度设定为30，火车头是沿着火车道自动行驶的。他和他手下的韩国人不知道从哪儿已经下了车，那个葛罗尔小姐和另外四个帮派首领很可能也跟他在一起，都从火车上消失不见了。当然了，我们在伊丽莎白维尔东边的公路上发现了他的运输车队。但是却一个司机也没有，当然很有可能是已经遣散了。但是金手指和他的一支还算强悍的队伍肯定藏在了什么地方。他们没有投奔诺福克的斯维尔德罗夫斯克巡洋舰。我们在码头布置了便衣侦查，根据他们的报告，巡洋舰按照原计划航行，并没有任何陌生人上船。东河边上的仓库那里甚至连只猫的影子也没有发现，无论是爱德怀尔德还是在墨西哥和加拿大的边境都没有发现这些人的踪迹。杰德·米德奈特可能会把他们弄到古巴去。假如他们从运输车队里开出两三辆卡车，全速前进的话，那么第二天清早可能就已经进入了佛罗里达州，比如那里的德通海滩。米德奈特在那边势力强大，那边的海警和空军也已经倾力出动，但是也没有发现任何踪迹。或许是他们打算昼伏夜出，趁天黑再逃往古巴。这件事让大家的神经都快绷断了，现在总统先生也是暴跳如雷，但是也于事无补啊。”

刚刚过去的这一天，邦德走过了华盛顿最厚重华丽的红地毯。他去听了在铸币局进行的演讲，参加了在五角大楼举办的高级军官午宴，还受到了总统长达15分钟的接见，剩下的时间他都在埃德加·胡佛的办公套房里跟一群速记员一起奋力工作着。在那个办公室里，他还见到了自己一位来自A站的同事。当天晚上，他通过大使馆的跨大西洋编码器跟M进行了十五分钟轻松愉快的谈话。M告诉他本案在欧洲的情况。正如邦德所料，金手指发给环球出口公司的电报引起了极大的重视。组织搜查了雷古弗和科佩的工厂，并在那里发现了更多的有关金手指走私敲诈黄金的证据。关于那架从麦加飞往孟买的飞机上的情况，印度政府也收到了警报。目前印度方面也已经开始采取行动进行处理了。瑞士特种大队在第一时间找到了邦德的汽车，并立即顺着邦德和蒂莉被胁迫带往美国的路线进行追踪。但是到了爱德怀尔德，美国联邦调查局却失去了线索。

M对邦德处理“猛然一击”的方式还算满意，但是他说英伦银行关于那价值两千万黄金的事情没少烦他。

金手指本来把这些黄金寄存在了纽约的帕拉冈保险寄存公司，但是在行动第一天已经全部取了出来。他们用一辆卡车秘密地将这些黄金运走了。本来英伦银行已经准备好了一份提交给议会的命令，一旦这些黄金被找到就立刻扣押下来，随后走一个程序来证明这些黄金是从英国走私而来的，或者至少证明这些黄金是由那些走私的黄金作本钱，经过各种可疑手段价值才得到了增长，但是现在这事儿却被美国财政部和联邦调查局接管了。鉴于M在美国没有管辖权，邦德最好是立即回国，做好善后工作。哦，对——在通话接近尾声的时候，M的嗓音有点儿沙哑了——他很善意地向首相请求允许邦德接收美国的最高荣誉奖。当然了，M还必须要解释清楚，英国情报局从来也不支持这种事情——尤其是外国授予的这种荣誉，然而他们真的很热情。结果很令人不满意，但是M知道邦德对此本来也心中有数，他知道规矩。邦德说：“是，当然没问题。”然后感谢了M，承诺赶最早的一班飞机回国。

此刻，两人在范怀克高速公路上行驶着，谁都没有再说什么。邦德突然模模糊糊感觉到一点儿不满意。他不喜欢给任何案件留下一个烂尾巴。那些大恶棍一个都没有落网。他的两项任务都没能完成，一个是抓住金手指，另一个是查获金手指的金条。“猛然一击”被破获无疑是一个奇迹。肯定是两天以前，清洁工开始打扫金手指的包机，发现了字条，并赶在莱特出发去海滨处理一场赛车丑闻之前半小时将字条送到了平克顿侦探事务所。随后，莱特便开始了四处奔波——向长官、联邦调查局以及五角大楼报告。联邦调查局对于邦德过去事迹早有了解，加上他们马上通过中央情报局与M进行了联系，这两方面的原因使得总统在短短的一小时内就得以了解这件事的全过程。接下来的工作便是在诺克斯堡进行了精心的布局，那里的居民都以某种方式参与了这场行动。那两个“日本人”被轻易拿下，经过军事化学研究部门证实，他们行李箱里携带了多达三品脱伪装成杜松子酒的甘氨酸甜菜碱，这个量足以放倒诺克斯堡所有的居民。经过一番拷问，两人很快供出了金手指的电报密码。电报发送给了金手指，部队进入了紧急状态。诺克斯堡地区陆路、铁路、航空全部封锁，却只对恶棍们的运输车队畅通。除此之外，他们还增加了粉色泡沫和婴儿推车这样的细节，主要是为了让表演显得更加逼真。

没错，到目前为止，华盛顿方面还是很满意的，但是英国方面呢？会有任何一个美国人在意本属于英伦银行的黄金吗？又会有谁在意在这整个事件过程中死去的两名英国女郎呢？既然现在美国的金库又恢复了安全状态，那么还会有谁在意金手指还在逍遥法外呢？

他们不紧不慢地在艾德威尔德褐色的平原上行驶着。在穿过了一座价值一千万美元正在建设中的机场的钢筋水泥骨架之后，在几个混凝土箱子外的临时护栏旁停了车。这里的一切邦德都熟悉无比，机场里传出了那颇有磁性的广播声音：“泛美世界航空公司提醒各位旅客，总统航班PA100马上就要起飞了。”“环球航空公司呼叫墨菲机长，墨菲机长，请速来报到。”还有带有英国腔的英国海外航空公司：“英国海外航空公司提醒各位旅客，百慕大航线BA491已经降落，各位旅客请从九号闸门入境。”

邦德拿了行李，与莱特道别：“好吧，谢谢你为我做的一切，菲利克斯；记得每天给我写信。”

莱特紧紧握住他的手说：“那是当然了，伙计，放轻松，告诉那个老混蛋M，早点儿派你回来，下次再来咱们要抽时间好好坐坐。到我家里，让你看看我那口油井。”

“再会。”

莱特上了车，驶离了停车的地方。邦德举起了一只手。只见车一个漂移上了引路。莱特右臂的铁钩在车窗一闪向邦德呼应了一下，就加速开走了。

邦德叹了口气，拿起行李走进机场，向英国海外航空公司的柜台走去。

邦德独自候机的时候不会感到不自在。现在他还有半个小时要等，他很愿意在机场来来往往的人群里转转，找个餐厅喝杯波旁威士忌加苏打水，再到书店找点什么东西读读。他买了一本本·霍根写的《现代高尔夫入门》和一本雷蒙德·钱德勒的新作，然后又到一个纪念品商店逛了逛，看看有没有什么有意思的小玩意儿，好买回去送给他的秘书。

英国海外航空公司的广播传出了一个男人的声音，他报出了一长串乘坐默纳克航班的旅客的名字，要求他们到票务柜台。十分钟后，当邦德正在付钱买一支最贵也是最新款的圆珠笔时，他听到自己的名字也在广播里出现了：“詹姆斯·邦德先生，乘坐英国海外航空公司默纳克航班510号飞往甘德及伦敦的邦德先生，听到广播请到英国海外航空公司票务柜台。”可恶的税收表格显然暴露了他身在美国期间的收入情况。照例，他并没有去纽约的国税局进行澄清，多年来，只有一次在艾德威尔德的时候他不得不对此进行了说明。他走出商店，来到了票务柜台。工作人员礼貌地说：“邦德先生，能出示一下您的健康证明吗？”

邦德从护照里把表格抽出来，递了过去。

工作人员仔细看了看，说：“非常抱歉，先生。甘德现在发现了一例伤寒病例，按照要求凡是六个月内没有注射伤寒疫苗的旅客都不允许到那里转机。这当然会给您带来不小的烦恼，但是甘德方面对这类事情一向很认真。很抱歉我们不能允许您登机，但是真的是没有办法。”

邦德对于预防接种是极其讨厌的，生气地说：“但是，你看这儿，我还是打过一两种别的疫苗的。20年来不是这事儿就是那事儿，不打不行。”他抬头看了看，英国海外航空公司的登机口前一片冷清，说：“别的旅客呢？都去哪儿了？”

“他们都同意现在注射了，先生。如果您也愿意的话，请随我到这边，只需要一分钟的时间。”

“哦，那好吧。”邦德不耐烦地耸了耸肩。他跟在柜台后面那个人的身后，穿过了一扇门，来到了英国海外航空公司经理办公室。一个身穿白大褂，戴着口罩的医生站在那里，手里的针早就准备好了。“最后一个吗？”他问英国海外航空公司的工作人员。

“是的，医生。”

“好。请脱掉外套，左边袖子掠起来。甘德那边对这事儿这么敏感，真是讨厌。”

“说的没错啊，”邦德说，“他们到底怕什么啊？怕传播黑死病吗？”

一股刺鼻的酒精味儿在空气中散播开来，针头猛地刺进了邦德的左臂。

“谢谢。”邦德粗声粗气地说。他把袖子拉下来，想从椅背上拿起外套。他的手向下一摸，没有摸到，再继续向下，继续向下，竟然触到了地板。继而，他的身体也倒了下来。

飞机上所有的灯都亮着。一眼望过去好多的空位。为什么他非得跟一个把胳膊搭在扶手上的旅客挤着坐在一起呢？他尝试着站起身来换个座位。一阵恶心从胃里直冲上来。他不得已闭上了眼睛等着这种感觉消退。真是奇怪！他从没晕过飞机。他感觉到自己脸上已经满是冷汗了。

手帕。有人在给他擦汗。他又一次睁开眼，低头看了看自己的双臂，双手的手腕都被绑在座位的扶手上。怎么回事？他记得自己打了针，然后好像就晕过去了。他这是被劫持了吗？这他妈的是怎么回事？他朝自己右边看过去，瞬间被惊得目瞪口呆。“得力”坐在自己身边。“得力”！穿着英国海外航空公司制服的“得力”！

“得力”面无表情地看了他一眼，按响了客服铃。邦德听见食品储藏室里传来一声悦耳的“叮咚”声。一阵女人穿短裙走路发出的“沙沙”声慢慢靠近。邦德抬头一看，是普西·葛罗尔，身穿空姐的蓝色制服，显得苗条而又清新。她说：“嗨，帅哥。”邦德还记得她那深邃的洞察的目光。那是什么时候了？几个世纪以前了吧？大概是前生吧？

邦德绝望地说：“上帝啊，这是怎么回事？你们是从哪儿来的？”

普西莞尔一笑：“吃着鱼子酱，喝着香槟。你们英国人在两万英尺高空醒来的时候过得还真舒服呢。就是没有找到包菜芽，也没看见有茶。好吧，现在你要放轻松。大叔想找你谈谈呢。”她扭着屁股沿着过道向前走了，进了驾驶舱的门，看不见了。

现在，邦德真可以做到处变不惊了。只见金手指身穿异常肥大的机长制服，帽子在他那足球一样的脑袋上又显得小得滑稽。他将身后驾驶舱的门关上，沿着通道向邦德走来。

他走到邦德身边，冷酷地看着邦德说：“嗯，邦德先生。看来命运想让我们继续把这游戏进行下去。但是，邦德先生，这次可别再想耍什么小把戏。哈！”

金手指的这一声尖叫融合着愤怒、坚忍和敬重：“现在看来我之前真是小看你了。”那颗大脑袋慢慢地摇了摇，“当初我为什么要留下你的性命呢！我为什么没有像踩死一只虫子一样的踩死你呢！你跟那女的当时对我有点儿利用价值。对，这一点我判断得没错。但是我为此冒的风险未免太大了。我一定是疯了。没错，疯了！”金手指压低了嗓音，慢慢地说：“现在，请你告诉我，邦德先生。你是怎么做到的？你是怎么通风报信的？”

邦德用相同的语气说：“好吧，金手指。咱们可以谈一谈。我可以解答你的一些疑问。但是你得先给我解开这些绳子，给我一杯加冰的波旁威士忌苏打水，还要一包切斯特菲尔德香烟。然后，你得先解答我的一点疑问，我再决定要将哪些信息透露给你。你说得没错，我现在处境不算好，至少表面看是这样。但是正所谓光脚不怕穿鞋的。你要想问出点儿什么，就得按我的套路来。”

金手指阴沉着脸：“我不会拒绝你的要求。但那只是敬重你是个强大的对手，理应让你人生最后的旅途舒适地度过。‘得力’，”金手指厉声说，“按铃叫葛罗尔小姐，让她把绳子解了。你坐到前面的位置。他坐在机舱最后不会构成什么威胁，看好了别让他进驾驶舱就行。如果有必要，立刻杀了他。但是我还是希望他能活着到目的地，明白吗？”

“系（是）！”

五分钟后，邦德提的要求都满足了。他座位前的托盘放了下来，威士忌和烟摆了上来。他倒了一杯纯威士忌。金手指就坐在过道对面的座位上等着。邦德端起杯子喝了一口。正准备再喝一口的时候，他注意到了一点异常。他轻轻放下酒杯，没有理会那个粘在杯底的圆形纸杯托。他点了一根烟，又端起酒杯喝了一口，然后把杯中的冰块拿出了来放回冰桶里。一仰头，把酒几乎喝干。现在透过杯子可以比较清楚地看到纸杯托上的字迹了。他看了一眼，若无其事地把杯子又放下了。纸杯托上写的是：“与你并肩。XXX.P.”

邦德朝金手指转过身，找了一个舒服的姿势，说：“好吧，咱们开始吧，金手指。首先，现在是什么情况，你这架飞机是怎么来的，我们要去哪儿？”

金手指跷起二郎腿。他的目光离开邦德，望着通道尽头，用轻松的语气说：“我们开着三辆卡车，长途跋涉到达了卡特拉斯角附近。第一辆上装的我私人储藏的黄金。第二辆上坐着我的司机、手下，还有那些混混们。一路上，我付给了这些人高额的报酬，逐渐遣散了他们，只留下了葛罗尔小姐，我现在只需保留最得力的助手了。在海滨地区，我找了个负责检修卡车的借口支开了葛罗尔小姐，然后找了个僻静的地方召集四大帮派的首领开了个会。在那里那四个人死在了我的枪口下，我的一贯风格——一枪一个。我跟卡车上剩下的人解释的是，这四个人选择了拿钱走人。到那个时候，我身边只剩下六个助手、一个女人，还有一车金条了。我雇用了一架飞机飞往新泽西的纽瓦克。我将金条装箱冒充X射线底片装上飞机。到达目的地之后，我单独行动找到纽约的一个秘密据点，在那里通过无线电与莫斯科通了话，解释了‘猛然一击’出了什么岔子。在汇报过程中，我提到了你的名字。我的朋友们，我想你知道我说的是什么人，”金手指恶狠狠地看着邦德，“他们在‘间谍之死’的黑名单中进行了查询，结果查到了你，当时我立刻明白了很多我早就该了解的信息。组织说他们很想跟你了解点儿情况。经过短时间的筹划，我制定出了本次行动计划。我冒充你的朋友，毫不费力地打听出了你要乘坐哪架航班。我手下有三个人以前在纳粹德国空军干过，驾驶这架飞机对他们来说保证不会有任何困难，剩下的就是些细节的筹划了。通过故弄玄虚、冒名顶替，当然还用了点武力，我们给艾德威尔德的英国海外航空公司所有员工、这架航班的全体机务人员以及乘客都注射了药物。当然他们现在也应该苏醒过来了。我们换上了机务人员的衣服，把金条运上飞机，还用担架把你抬了上来。很快，我们这些新的英国海外航空公司机务人员、空姐都准备就绪，登上飞机，随后飞机就起飞了。”

金手指停顿了一下，无可奈何地抬起了一只手：“当然了，这个过程中我们也遇到了一些麻烦。指挥塔命令我们‘通过阿尔法滑行跑道上第四跑道’，我们费尽力气，最后通过模仿一架荷兰航空公司的飞机才成功了。艾德威尔德机场的飞行程序不好掌握，我们当时肯定显得笨拙又不熟练，但是，邦德先生，靠着厚脸皮、沉着冷静、生硬的态度，再加上恐吓威胁，要想击垮政府公务人员的意志也不是什么难事，毕竟，那都是些小人物。我从无线电报员那里了解到，他们已经开始搜寻这架飞机了。我们在南塔基特的纵向水平范围内时就已经受到怀疑了。之后远程预警系统也反复对我们进行了询问。但是这些都对我没有构成丝毫的影响。我们燃料足够。莫斯科已经为我们清扫了通往东柏林、基辅或摩尔曼斯克的道路。哪边天气允许我们就选择哪条航线，不会出现任何问题。万一有的话，我也能通过无线电扫除障碍。这么值钱的一架英国海外航空公司的飞机，不会有人舍得击落的。我们行踪和目的地的隐秘性和迷惑性会一直保护我们，直到我们到达苏维埃政权的领地，当然了，我们身后不能留下任何踪迹。”

自从听过金手指介绍“猛然一击”的细节之后，对于邦德来说，没有什么事情是金手指办不到的。如金手指介绍的细节，偷飞机这件事本是极其不可思议的，但是跟他走私黄金、购买核弹头这些事迹比起来还算什么呢？对于一个富有想象力的人，甚至是一个天才，仔细审视这些事迹的时候也会对他的逻辑思维而叹服，这些才算症结所在。甚至连跟杜邦打牌的时候出千这样的小伎俩，他也是设计得天衣无缝。有一点是毋庸置疑的——金手指是一位艺术家——一位犯罪方面的大科学家，甚至可以称得上是犯罪界的切利尼(1)或爱因斯坦。

“那么现在，英国情报局的邦德先生，实现你的诺言吧。你有什么要告诉我的？谁派你来追查我的？他们怀疑什么了？你是怎么做到破坏我的计划的？”金手指靠在椅背上，双臂在胸前交叉，抬头看着屋顶。

邦德将实际情况给金手指讲述了一遍，当然他也做了一些必要的删节。他没有涉及任何关于“间谍之死”以及“邮筒”的情况，他更没有提到自己车上安装的信号接收器，这个设备对于俄国来说可能还是个新鲜事物呢。最后，他总结了一下：“你看，金手指，你只是侥幸逃脱了，要不是蒂莉·玛斯特顿在日内瓦节外生枝，你早就该落网了，那么你此刻就应该在瑞士的某间监狱里闲坐着剔牙，等着被遣送到英国呢。你低估英国人了，他们早晚会抓到你的。你觉得你躲在俄国就安全了吗？我看可不一定。我们很早以前就在那里安插了人手，我再给你的书推荐一个警句吧：金手指，‘别惹英国人。’”

第二十三章　TLC疗法


飞机在高空颠簸着，俯瞰着月光照耀下风景画一样的地面，灯全部熄灭了。邦德静静地坐在黑暗中，冷汗直流，惴惴不安地筹划着自己接下来该怎么行动。

一个小时前，普西小姐给他拿来了晚餐。他发现餐巾里藏了一支铅笔。她奉承了“得力”几句就走开了。邦德吃了几口，喝了不少威士忌。他一边吃着一边琢磨着是否可以采取点儿什么行动迫使飞机在甘德或新斯科舍之类的地方紧急降落。实在不行，他是不是可以在飞机上放把火呢？他天马行空地想着，设计着任何能够将舱口打开的可能性。两种方法似乎不仅不现实，而且几乎是自杀行为。终于，金手指手下的一个德国人过来了，这些不切实际的想法被打断了，邦德曾在英国海外航空公司的票务柜台见过他。

这个德国人站在邦德的座位旁边，低头对他咧嘴一笑：“英国海外航空公司对你照顾得还挺周到，不是吗？金手指先生觉得你可能会产生些愚蠢的想法，所以派我到机尾监督着点儿。你就踏踏实实坐着，好好享受旅途的乐趣吧，好吧？”

没等邦德回答，德国人就继续向机尾方向走去了。

邦德刚才那些念头又开始困扰着他了，他又琢磨着怎么强行打开机舱门了。对了，1957年伊朗上空的那架飞机是怎么做到的？邦德定定地坐了一会儿，眼睛瞪得大大地盯着他前面座位的椅背。没准儿这样可以！有可能！

邦德在餐巾的内侧写上：“马上行动。系好安全带。XXX.J.”

普西小姐来收餐盘的时候，邦德故意让餐巾掉到地上，又弯腰捡起来递到她手中。他握住普西的手，迎着她那询问的目光微笑了一下。她弯腰拿起餐盘，顺势在他脸颊上吻了一下。随后，她很自然地站直身体，生硬地说了句：“我会与你在梦中相会的，帅哥。”就转身朝厨房走去了。

此刻，邦德已经下定了决心。他对自己的计划已经是胸有成竹了。他在心中测量好了距离，鞋底的匕首也抽出来藏到了外套里，将座位上的安全带较长的那头缠在了自己的左臂上。只等“得力”一转身就可以行动了。期望“得力”睡着有点儿不太现实，但是至少他也会稍稍换换姿势让自己坐得舒服一点儿吧。邦德死死地盯着前面座位旁边椭圆形的有机玻璃窗，上面映着“得力”那模模糊糊的身影。但是“得力”坐在他的座位上一动不动，他头顶的阅读灯一直亮着，可以看到他的嘴巴微微张开，眼睛盯着屋顶，双手看似放松地放在扶手上，实则做好了随时发起攻击的准备。

一个小时，两个小时，邦德开始有节奏打起了呼噜，他希望能用这种方式将“得力”催眠。这时，“得力”的手移到了大腿上。他的头向下点了一下，又马上抬起，他本能地调整了一下坐姿，寻找一个更加舒服的姿势。他把头从刺眼的灯光下转了过去，左脸靠在了椅背上，视线从邦德这边移开了！

邦德继续均匀地打着呼噜。想在韩国人的监视下不知不觉地做好行动准备，就像通过一道由饥饿的马士提獒犬把守的关口。他小心翼翼地掏出匕首，对准了墙壁和“得力”的座位之间的位置。好！现在他已经摆好了姿势。匕首锋利的刀尖瞄准了他在玻璃窗上选定的一个点。准备就绪之后，邦德将安全带的一头紧紧抓着手中，将匕首轻轻抽回两英寸，然后猛地刺了出去。

匕首刺破窗户之后会发生什么情况呢？邦德心里也没底。他只是有一次听到媒体报道有一架伊朗的飞机出现了类似的情况，由于机舱内压力较大，窗户破碎之后强大的吸力会将靠窗的乘客吸出窗户。在他将匕首刺出的那一刹那，空气急速流动产生了类似哀号或是尖叫的声音传来，同时，邦德感觉一股强大的力量将他猛地向前一拉，拍在了“得力”的椅背上，他手上的安全带一下子被扯断了。几乎在同时，他目睹了神奇的一幕。那哀号着的黑洞似乎将“得力”的身体朝它的方向拉长了。他的头先钻了进去，继而是肩膀“哐”的一声撞在窗框上。然后，就好像挤牙膏一样，这个韩国人的身体一英尺一英尺地被那漆黑的、哀号着的窗口吞噬着。腰部出去之后，他那庞大的臀部又被卡住了，但是还是一英寸一英寸地在慢慢向外移动。终于，最后随着“砰”的一声，臀部也被吸出去了，他的整个身体就像一颗被射出去的子弹，从窗口消失不见了。

机舱里随之乱成了一团，跟世界末日的情景差不多。厨房里传来了盆盆罐罐掉落的“叮叮当当”的声音。巨大的飞机机头朝下，朝地面扎去。破碎的那扇窗户里传来了尖叫般的引擎声，很多的枕头、被子也都忽地飞起，从邦德面前掠过，被破碎的窗口吸到机舱以外去了。邦德奋力抱住身前的椅背，伴随着肺部的一阵剧痛，他本已极度缺氧的身体再也支撑不住，晕过去了。

肋骨上的剧痛又让邦德醒了过来，是有人在踢他。他的嘴里泛起了一丝血腥味儿，呻吟了一下，身上又被踢了一脚。他忍着剧痛挣扎着在两排座椅之间跪了起来。大概是血流到了眼睛上，他的眼前好像覆盖了一层红色的薄膜。透过这层薄膜，邦德看见，机舱里面所有的灯都亮了起来，空气里弥漫着一层薄雾。机舱的快速泄压已经使里面的温度降到了零点以下。从破碎的窗口里传进来的引擎声音大得吓人。冰冷的风像利刃一样割在邦德的身上。金手指就站在他的身旁，在黄色灯光的照射下，那张丑陋的脸显得越发冷酷阴郁。金手指手里紧紧握着一支小型自动手枪，只见他将脚抬起往后一撤，又是一脚踢了出去。邦德心中一股怒气瞬间爆发。他抓住金手指踢过来的那只脚，用尽力气一拧，几乎把他的脚踝拧断。金手指“啊”的一声尖叫。这时，机身好像撞上了什么，抖动了一下。邦德朝着过道方向一跃而起，又侧身扑在金手指倒下的身体上。爆炸产生的火焰朝他一侧的脸庞扑来。他顾不上理会，将膝盖重重地砸向金手指的下身，同时左手按住了金手指拿枪的手。

这还是人生中第一次，邦德变得像头猛兽一样狂暴。他将膝盖压在金手指那拼命挣扎的身体上，拳头雨点儿一样地砸下去，还一次又一次地将自己的额头撞向金手指那张油光锃亮的脸。金手指用尽全力，又一次将颤抖的枪口对准了邦德。邦德不带丝毫感情地用掌边猛砍过去，枪“咔嗒”一声掉落在座位旁边的地上。两个人互相扼住了喉咙。邦德的手指按住金手指的颈动脉，向下用力，再用力，将自己全身的重量向前压过去，挣扎着呼吸着。

他会不会在掐死对手之前就晕过去呢？会吗？他能承受得住金手指非凡的手劲吗？那张满月般的圆脸现在脸色变了，棕色的皮肤现在呈现了紫红色，眼睛也渐渐眯上了。扼住邦德喉咙的手力量逐渐减弱，最后，终于松开了。金手指嘴巴张着，舌头伸出来耷拉着，肺部剧烈地痉挛了几下。等金手指的肺部彻底平静下来之后，邦德终于松了口气，将自己的两腿跨过他的尸体坐了下来，慢慢地一个挨一个地活动了一下自己僵硬的手指。

邦德长出一口气，双膝跪地，然后站起身来。他怔怔地看了看明亮的机舱，普西·葛罗尔在厨房边的一个座位上半躺半坐着，紧紧地系着安全带，衣衫凌乱。一个警卫四肢伸开地躺在过道中间，一只胳膊和头角度看起来很不正常，看样子是已经摔断了。显然飞机坠落的时候他没有系安全带，当时一定像个布娃娃一样被甩到了飞机顶上。

邦德用手在脸上抹了一把，现在他才感觉到自己的手掌和脸颊都像着火了一样炙热。

他疲倦不堪，重新双膝跪地，在地上搜寻着那支手枪，那是一支柯尔特式25自动手枪。他“咔嗒”一声打开了弹夹，里面剩下了三颗子弹，其中一颗已经上了膛。邦德踉踉跄跄地沿着过道走到普西的座位旁，解开她的外衣扣子，把手放在她温暖的胸部。她的心脏像只鸽子一样在他的掌心下扑通扑通跳着。他解开系在普西身上的安全带，将她脸朝下放在地上，双腿跨在她的身体两侧跪了下来。他有节奏地在她的肺部按压着，持续了五分钟之后，她发出了一声呻吟。邦德站起身来沿着过道继续向前走过去，从那个死亡的警卫肩上的枪套里拿出了一把鲁格尔半自动手枪。踉踉跄跄往回走的时候，他看到了一瓶波旁威士忌完好无损地在地上滚来滚去。他弯腰将酒捡起来，拔开软木塞，仰头往自己的嘴里倒了一股。酒精刺激着他的喉咙，火烧火燎的，像是喝了一口消毒剂。

他重新把软木塞塞好，继续向前走去。他在驾驶舱门口站了有一分钟之久，再三考虑之后，他两只手各拿一把手枪，按下把手，走了进去。五张脸齐齐地向他转过来。在仪器微光的映照下，他们的脸色都是幽蓝幽蓝的。五张嘴大大地张着，像五个黑窟窿，五双眼睛也都闪着白光。这里的引擎声音比外面小了很多。空气里弥漫着一股冷汗混合着烟草的气味。邦德紧绷双膝站稳，双枪稳稳地拿在手中。他说：“金手指已经死了。胆敢有不遵守命令随便乱动者，跟他一样的下场。飞行员，报出飞机的位置、路线、高度和速度。”

飞行员咽了口唾沫，干巴巴地说：“先生，我们现在的位置是古斯湾以东大约500英里。金手指先生命令我们让飞机在离北海岸尽可能近的地方降落。之后，我们会在蒙特利尔重新集合，金手指先生还说我们回头再回来运黄金。我们的飞行速度是每小时250英里，高度2000.”

“以这样的高度飞机还能飞多远？燃料肯定很快就要用完了吧？”

“是，先生。我估计以这样的高度和速度我们还能飞两个小时。”

“给我报个时间。”

飞行员立刻回答说：“刚刚收到一个来自华盛顿的时间信号，先生。凌晨4∶55，在这个高度的话黎明大概一个小时后到来。”

“查理气象船在什么位置？”

“东北方向大概300英里，先生。”

“飞行员，你觉得你能飞到古斯湾吗？”

“不能，先生，只能飞到距离那里大概100英里的地方。我们只能飞到那边的北海岸附近。”

“好，改变航向，往查理气象船方向去。接线员，开始呼叫，话筒给我。”

“是，先生。”

飞机在空中转了一个大大的弯。邦德听到他头顶上的扩音器里传来了“哧啦哧啦”静电的声音和一些细碎的讲话声。

紧接着出现了接线员柔和的嗓音：“查理海洋站。我是510号飞鸟。G-ALGY呼叫查理，G-ALGY呼叫查理，G-ALGY……”

一个尖锐的声音突然插了进来：“G-ALGY请报出你的位置。G-ALGY请报出你的位置。我是甘德控制中心。紧急。G-ALGY……”

紧接着伦敦微弱的信号也出现了，一个兴奋的声音开始喋喋不休。现在，他们突然同时收到了来自四面八方的信号。邦德脑子里出现了各种画面：各飞行控制中心同时快速协调定位，各地的工作人员忙作一团，不知道多少人同时拿起电话开始拨号，世界各地的飞行控制中心工作人员用急迫的语气互相交谈着。一时之间，甘德控制中心的信号盖过了其他所有电台信号。“我已定位G-ALGY。位置北纬50，东经70。其他站请暂停发射信号，给我优先权。重复，我已定位G-ALGY……”

突然，查理文静的声音出现了：“我是查理海洋站，呼叫510号飞鸟。查理呼叫G-ALGY。收到吗？510号飞鸟请讲。”

邦德将手枪塞进衣服口袋，接过麦克风。他一边打开开关，对着麦克风小声说话，一边从长方形的窗口监视着那几名机务人员。

“查理，我是昨晚在艾德维尔被劫持的G-ALGY。我已经杀死了劫机者，并且通过泄压给飞机造成了一定的损坏。我现在已经控制了机务人员。燃料不足，不能飞抵古斯湾。请求在离你最近的地点迫降。请求布置闪光灯带。”

另一个更加权威的声音传来，讲话者很有可能是位站长：“我是查理。你的信息已收到，明白。请求鉴定讲话者身份。重复，请求鉴定讲话者身份。完毕。”

邦德想到他的话可能给对方带来的震动不禁一笑：“呼叫查理。我是英国情报局特工，代号007。重复，代号007。英国政府无线电可以确认。重复，英国政府无线电可以确认。完毕。”

信号突然中断了一下，继而来自全世界的信号又都尝试连接。某个控制中心，估计是甘德吧，将它们都屏蔽掉了。查理的信号才又重新出现了：“飞鸟，我是查理，代号天使加百利。好的，我会向英国政府求证，并依照请求为你布置闪光灯带，但是伦敦和甘德方面需要了解更多信息。”

邦德打断了对方：“抱歉，查理。我现在必须监视着飞机上的五个机务人员，不方便介绍细节。请将海面上的情况报告给我，之后我要暂停广播，降落时再进行呼叫。”

“好的，由于有风海面上出现了两股巨大的海浪，你需要小心。我会用雷达追踪你，并监测你的波段。我会备好威士忌，等你的好消息。完毕。”

邦德说：“非常感谢查理，最好再多准备一杯茶，机上有一位漂亮女士。我是飞鸟，完毕。”

邦德关上开关，将麦克风还给电报接线员，说：“飞行员，他们即将布置好闪光灯带，并时刻监测我们的波段。海风造成海面上有两股巨浪。我们要提高警惕，尽全力脱险。飞机一落到水面上我就把舱门打开。在此之前如果谁胆敢迈出驾驶舱门一步，我立刻开枪。听清了吧？”

这时门后传来了一个女士的声音：“我本来是想参加你们的聚会的，但是现在看来还是算了吧，我可不想被杀。但是能不能麻烦你再给刚才那位先生打回去，告诉他还是要两份威士忌吧，一闻到茶的味儿我就反胃。”

邦德说：“普西，回你的座位上去。”他匆匆地朝驾驶舱里环视了一下，也退到了门外。

接下来的两个小时过得像两年一样漫长。但是终于在熬过一番磨难之后，邦德现在可以在查理气象船温暖的船舱里躺着，出神地听着加拿大的早间广播节目。他的身体很多部位都疼得厉害。就在刚才，他还在机舱的尾部，教普西穿好救生衣，跪在一个座位上，保持身体弯曲、双手抱头的姿势。然后，他挤进普西与椅背之间，双臂紧紧抱住她的身体，后背紧紧靠在椅背上。

普西显得有点儿紧张，但还是拿他们这种不雅的姿势开着玩笑。突然，飞机腹部“砰”的一声，以每小时100英里的速度拍在第一股巨浪上。巨大的机身先是向上弹起，继而一头扎进巨浪里。机尾一下子被巨浪拍断了。行李舱里装载的大量黄金的重量使机身一下断成两截，邦德和普西被甩进了冰冷的海水里。他们穿着黄色的救生衣，在被闪光灯带映红的海水里浮浮沉沉，直到救生船把他们救起。海面上只剩下几片漂浮的飞机残骸，那几名飞行员早已随着飞机上重达三吨的巨额黄金沉入了大西洋的海底。救生船在海面上搜索了十多分钟，没有发现一具尸体飘上来，最后只好放弃了搜索，回到了护卫舰上。

舰上的人们带着新奇的眼光热情地接待了他们。邦德回答了一些基本的至关重要的问题后，突然感觉自己有点体力不支了。现在，他一边舒适地享受着威士忌给他的身体带来的温度和这场大难之后难得的平静，一边琢磨着为什么普西·葛罗尔会放弃金手指，转而向他寻求庇护呢？

这时，通往隔壁船舱的门“吱”的一声打开了，普西走了进来。她身上只穿着一件灰色的针织衫，袖子挽了起来，那样子看起来就像是维尔特斯的油画里面的角色。她说：“总有人问我用不用在身体上擦点酒精，我说，如果要擦酒的话，我谁也不用，就让你帮我擦。不管在身上擦什么吧，那个帮我的人也必须是你。”她有点难为情地说，“所以我就过来了。”

邦德赶紧说：“快关上门，普西。把那衣服脱下来，躺到床上，你这样会着凉的。”

她像个顺从的孩子一样照做了。

她躺在邦德的臂弯里，抬头看着他说：“我进了新新监狱后你会给我写信吗？”那语气听起来一点儿都没有一个恶棍的味道，也不像是一个女同性恋，那语气俨然是一名娇柔的女子。

邦德低头看着那双深邃的紫蓝色眼睛，那咄咄逼人、骄傲蛮横的目光也完全不见了。他弯腰在那双眼睛上吻了一下，说：“他们说你只喜欢女人。”

她回答说：“那是因为我以前从来没有遇到过一个真正的男人。”她的语气里重新又显示出了一丝阳刚气，“我老家是南方，你知道在那儿要保持处女之身是什么概念吗？呵呵，那意味着你必须要跑得比自己的兄弟快才行。当年，我没能跑过我的叔叔，那时候我才12岁。那种感觉可真不怎么样，詹姆斯，你肯定猜到是怎么回事了。”

邦德朝那张苍白而美丽的脸庞微笑了一下，说：“你这种情况需要的是TLC疗法。”

“什么叫TLC疗法？”

“就是用爱、温柔和关心来进行治疗的方法，书上写的，当一个流浪儿进了儿童收容所就要接受这种疗法。”

“我愿意接受，”她望着在她面前等候着的炽热而坚毅的双唇，伸手拨开搭在他右眼眉上的一绺黑色的头发，目光转移到了邦德那双眯着的热烈的眼睛上，“什么时候开始？”

邦德的右手从那双结实的大腿往上，抚过她平坦而柔软的腹部，停留在普西右侧的乳房上。她的乳头坚挺，早已欲火中烧了。他柔声说了句“现在”，就将嘴唇重重地朝普西的双唇压了下去……





PART ONE：HAPPENSTANCE





CHAPTER ONE REFLECTIONS IN A DOUBLE BOURBON


JAMES BOND, with two double bourbons inside him, sat in the final departure lounge of Miami Airport and thought about life and death.

It was part of his profession to kill people. He had never liked doing it and when he had to kill he did it as well as he knew how and forgot about it. As a secret agent who held the rare double-O prefix—the licence to kill in the Secret Service—it was his duty to be as cool about death as a surgeon. If it happened, it happened. Regret was unprofessional—worse, it was death-watch beetle in the soul.

And yet there had been something curiously impressive about the death of the Mexican. It wasn’t that he hadn’t deserved to die. He was an evil man, a man they call in Mexico a capungo. A capungo is a bandit who will kill for as little as forty pesos, which is about twenty-five shillings—though probably he had been paid more to attempt the killing of Bond—and, from the look of him, he had been an instrument of pain and misery all his life. Yes, it had certainly been time for him to die; but when Bond had killed him, less than twenty-four hours before, life had gone out of the body so quickly, so utterly, that Bond had almost seen it come out of his mouth as it does, in the shape of a bird, in Haitian primitives.

What an extraordinary difference there was between a body full of person and a body that was empty！Now there is someone, now there is no one. This had been a Mexican with a name and an address, an employment card and perhaps a driving licence. Then something had gone out of him, out of the envelope of flesh and cheap clothes, and had left him an empty paper bag waiting for the dustcart. And the difference, the thing that had gone out of the stinking Mexican bandit, was greater than all Mexico.

Bond looked down at the weapon that had done it. The cutting edge of his right hand was red and swollen. It would soon show a bruise. Bond flexed the hand, kneading it with his left. He had been doing the same thing at intervals through the quick plane trip that had got him away. It was a painful process, but if he kept the circulation moving the hand would heal more quickly. One couldn’t tell how soon the weapon would be needed again. Cynicism gathered at the corners of Bond’s mouth.

National Airlines, “Airline of the Stars”, announces the departure of their flight NA to La Guardia Field, New York. Will all passengers please proceed to gate number seven.

“All aboard, please.”The Tannoy switched off with an echoing click. Bond glanced at his watch. At least another ten minutes before Transamerica would be called. He signalled to a waitress and ordered another double bourbon on the rocks. When the wide, chunky glass came, he swirled the liquor round for the ice to blunt it down and swallowed half of it. He stubbed out the butt of his cigarette and sat, his chin resting on his left hand, and gazed moodily across the twinkling tarmac to where the last half of the sun was slipping gloriously into the Gulf.

The death of the Mexican had been the finishing touch to a bad assignment, one of the worst—squalid, dangerous and without any redeeming feature except that it had got him away from headquarters.

A big man in Mexico had some poppy fields. The flowers were not for decoration. They were broken down for opium which was sold quickly and comparatively cheaply by the waiters at a small cafe in Mexico City called the ‘Madre de Cacao’. The Madre de Cacao had plenty of protection. If you needed opium you walked in and ordered what you wanted with your drink. You paid for your drink at the caisse and the man at the caisse told you how many noughts to add to your bill. It was an orderly commerce of no concern to anyone outside Mexico. Then, far away in England, the Government, urged on by the United Nations’ drive against drug smuggling, announced that heroin would be banned in Britain. There was alarm in Soho and also among respectable doctors who wanted to save their patients agony. Prohibition is the trigger of crime. Very soon the routine smuggling channels from China, Turkey and Italy were ran almost dry by the illicit stock-piling in England. In Mexico City, a pleasant-spoken Import and Export merchant called Blackwell had a sister in England who was a heroin addict. He loved her and was sorry for her and, when she wrote that she would die if someone didn’t help, he believed that she wrote the truth and set about investigating the illicit dope traffic in Mexico. In due course, through friends and friends of friends, he got to the Madre de Cacao and on from there to the big Mexican grower. In the process, he came to know about the economics of the trade, and he decided that if he could make a fortune and at the same time help suffering humanity he had found the Secret of Life. Blackwell’s business was in fertilizers. He had a warehouse and a small plant and a staff of three for soil testing and plant research. It was easy to persuade the big Mexican that, behind this respectable front, Blackwell’s team could busy itself extracting heroin from opium. Carriage to England was swiftly arranged by the Mexican. For the equivalent of a thousand pounds a trip, every month one of the diplomatic couriers of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs carried an extra suitcase to London.

The price was reasonable. The contents of the suitcase, after the Mexican had deposited it at the Victoria Station left-luggage office and had mailed the ticket to a man called Schwab, c/o Boox-an-Pix, Ltd, WC1, were worth twenty thousand pounds.

Unfortunately Schwab was a bad man, unconcerned with suffering humanity. He had the idea that if American juvenile delinquents could consume millions of dollars’ worth of heroin every year, so could their Teddy boy and girl cousins. In two rooms in Pimlico, his staff watered the heroin with stomach powder and sent it on its way to the dance halls and amusement arcades.

Schwab had already made a fortune when the CID Ghost Squad got on to him. Scotland Yard decided to let him make a little more money while they investigated the source of his supply. They put a close tail on Schwab and in due course were led to Victoria Station and thence to the Mexican courier. At that stage, since a foreign country was concerned, the Secret Service had had to be called in and Bond was ordered to find out where the courier got his supplies and to destroy the channel at source.

Bond did as he was told. He flew to Mexico City and quickly got to the Madre de Cacao. Thence, posing as a buyer for the London traffic, he got back to the big Mexican. The Mexican received him amiably and referred him to Blackwell. Bond had rather taken to Blackwell. He knew nothing about Blackwell’s sister, but the man was obviously an amateur and his bitterness about the heroin ban in England rang true. Bond broke into his warehouse one night and left a thermite bomb. He then went and sat in a cafe a mile away and watched the flames leap above the horizon of rooftops and listened to the silver cascade of the fire-brigade bells. The next morning he telephoned Blackwell. He stretched a handkerchief across the mouthpiece and spoke through it.

“Sorry you lost your business last night. I’m afraid your insurance won’t cover those stocks of soil you were researching.”

“Who’s that? Who’s speaking?”

“I’m from England. That stuff of yours has killed quite a lot of young people over there. Damaged a lot of others. Santos won’t be coming to England any more with his diplomatic bag. Schwab will be in jail by tonight. That fellow Bond you’ve been seeing, he won’t get out of the net either. The police are after him now.”

Frightened words came back down the line.

“All right, but just don’t do it again. Stick to fertilizers.”

Bond hung up.

Blackwell wouldn’t have had the wits. It was obviously the big Mexican who had seen through the false trail. Bond had taken the precaution to move his hotel, but that night, as he walked home after a last drink at the Copacabana, a man suddenly stood in his way. The man wore a dirty white linen suit and a chauffeur’s white cap that was too big for his head. There were deep blue shadows under Aztec cheek-bones. In one corner of the slash of a mouth there was a toothpick and in the other a cigarette. The eyes were bright pinpricks of marihuana.

“You like woman? Make jigajig?”

“No.”

“Coloured girl? Fine jungle tail?”

“No.”

“Mebbe pictures?”

The gesture of the hand slipping into the coat was so well known to Bond, so full of old dangers that when the hand flashed out and the long silver finger went for his throat, Bond was on balance and ready for it.

Almost automatically, Bond went into the “Parry Defence against Underhand Thrust”out of the book. His right arm cut across, his body swivelling with it. The two forearms met mid-way between the two bodies, banging the Mexican’s knife arm off target and opening his guard for a crashing short-arm chin jab with Bond’s left. Bond’s stiff, locked wrist had not travelled far, perhaps two feet, but the heel of his palm, with ringers spread for rigidity, had come up and under the man’s chin with terrific force. The blow almost lifted the man off the sidewalk. Perhaps it had been that blow that had killed the Mexican, broken his neck, but as he staggered back on his way to the ground, Bond had drawn back his right hand and slashed sideways at the taut, offered throat. It was the deadly handedge blow to the Adam’s apple, delivered with the fingers locked into a blade, that had been the standby of the Commandos. If the Mexican was still alive, he was certainly dead before he hit the ground.

Bond stood for a moment, his chest heaving, and looked at the crumpled pile of cheap clothes flung down in the dust. He glanced up and down the street. There was no one. Some cars passed. Others had perhaps passed during the fight, but it had been in the shadows. Bond knelt down beside the body. There was no pulse. Already the eyes that had been so bright with marihuana were glazing. The house in which the Mexican had lived was empty. The tenant had left.

Bond picked up the body and laid it against a wall in deeper shadow. He brushed his hands down his clothes, felt to see if his tie was straight and went on to his hotel.

At dawn Bond had got up and shaved and driven to the airport where he took the first plane out of Mexico. It happened to be going to Caracas. Bond flew to Caracas and hung about in the transit lounge until there was a plane for Miami, a Transamerica Constellation that would take him on that same evening to New York.

Again the Tannoy buzzed and echoed. “Transamerica regrets to announce a delay on their flight TR 618 to New York due to a mechanical defect. The new departure time will be at eight am. Will all passengers please report to the Transamerica ticket counter where arrangements for their overnight accommodation will be made. Thank you.”

So！That too！Should he transfer to another flight or spend the night in Miami? Bond had forgotten his drink. He picked it up and, tilting his head back, swallowed the bourbon to the last drop. The ice tinkled cheerfully against his teeth. That was it. That was an idea. He would spend the night in Miami and get drunk, stinking drunk so that he would have to be carried to bed by whatever tart he had picked up. He hadn’t been drunk for years. It was high time. This extra night, thrown at him out of the blue, was a spare night, a gone night. He would put it to good purpose. It was time he let himself go. He was too tense, too introspective. What the hell was he doing, glooming about this Mexican, this capungo who had been sent to kill him? It had been kill or get killed. Anyway, people were killing other people all the time, all over the world. People were using their motor cars to kill with. They were carrying infectious diseases around, blowing microbes in other people’s faces, leaving gasjets turned on in kitchens, pumping out carbon monoxide in closed garages. How many people, for instance, were involved in manufacturing H-bombs, from the miners who mined the uranium to the shareholders who owned the mining shares? Was there any person in the world who wasn’t somehow, perhaps only statistically, involved in killing his neighbour?

The last light of the day had gone. Below the indigo sky the flare paths twinkled green and yellow and threw tiny reflections off the oily skin of the tarmac. With a shattering roar a DC 7 hurtled down the main green lane. The windows in the transit lounge rattled softly. People got up to watch. Bond tried to read their expressions. Did they hope the plane would crash—give them something to watch, something to talk about, something to fill their empty lives? Or did they wish it well? Which way were they willing the sixty passengers? To live or to die?

Bond’s lips turned down. Cut it out. Stop being so damned morbid. All this is just reaction from a dirty assignment. You’re stale, tired of having to be tough. You want a change. You’ve seen too much death. You want a slice of life—easy, soft, high.

Bond was conscious of steps approaching. They stopped at his side. Bond looked up. It was a clean, rich-looking, middle-aged man. His expression was embarrassed, deprecating.

“Pardon me, but surely it’s Mr Bond… Mr—er—James Bond?”





CHAPTER TWO LIVING IT UP


BOND LIKED anonymity. His “Yes, it is” was discouraging.

“Well, that’s a mighty rare coincidence.” The man held out his hand. Bond rose slowly, took the hand and released it. The hand was pulpy and unarticulated—like a hand-shaped mud pack, or an inflated rubber glove. “My name is Du Pont. Junius Du Pont. I guess you won’t remember me, but we’ve met before. Mind if I sit down?”

The face, the name? Yes, there was something familiar. Long ago. Not in America. Bond searched the files while he summed the man up. Mr Du Pont was about fifty—pink, clean-shaven and dressed in the conventional disguise with which Brooks Brothers cover the shame of American millionaires. He wore a single-breasted dark tan tropical suit and a white silk shirt with a shallow collar. The rolled ends of the collar were joined by a gold safety pin beneath the knot of a narrow dark red and blue striped tie that fractionally wasn’t the Brigade of Guards’. The cuffs of the shirt protruded half an inch below the cuffs of the coat and showed cabochon crystal links containing miniature trout flies. The socks were charcoal-grey silk and the shoes were old and polished mahogany and hinted Peal. The man carried a dark, narrow-brimmed straw Homburg with a wide claret ribbon.

Mr Du Pont sat down opposite Bond and produced cigarettes and a plain gold Zippo lighter. Bond noticed that he was sweating slightly. He decided that Mr Du Pont was what he appeared to be, a very rich American, mildly embarrassed. He knew he had seen him before, but he had no idea where or when.

“Smoke?”

“Thank you.”It was a Parliament. Bond affected not to notice the offered lighter. He disliked held-out lighters. He picked up his own and lit the cigarette.

Trance, “51, Royale les Eaux.” Mr Du Pont looked eagerly at Bond. “That Casino. Ethel, that’s Mrs Du Pont, and me were next to you at the table the night you had the big game with the Frenchman.”

Bond’s memory raced back. Yes, of course. The Du Ponts had been Nos 4 and 5 at the baccarat table. Bond had been 6. They had seemed harmless people. He had been glad to have such a solid bulwark on his left on that fantastic night when he had broken Le Chiffre. Now Bond saw it all again—the bright pool of light on the green baize, the pink crab hands across the table scuttling out for the cards.

He smelled the smoke and the harsh tang of his own sweat. That had been a night！Bond looked across at Mr Du Pont and smiled at the memory. “Yes, of course I remember. Sorry I was slow. But that was quite a night. I wasn’t thinking of much except my cards.” Mr Du Pont grinned back, happy and relieved. “Why, gosh, Mr Bond. Of course I understand. And I do hope you’ll pardon me for butting in. You see…” He snapped his ringers for a waitress. “But we must have a drink to celebrate. What’ll you have?”

“Thanks. Bourbon on the rocks.”

“And dimple Haig and water.” The waitress went away.

Mr Du Pont leant forward, beaming. A whiff of soap or after-shave lotion came across the table. “I knew it was you. As soon as I saw you sitting there. But I thought to myself, Junius, you don’t often make an error over a face, but let’s just go make sure. Well, I was flying Transamerican tonight and, when they announced the delay, I watched your expression and, if you’ll pardon me, Mr Bond, it was pretty clear from the look on your face that you had been flying Transamerican too.” He waited for Bond to nod. He hurried on. “So I ran down to the ticket counter and had me a look at the passenger list.Sure enough, there it was, J. Bond.”

Mr Du Pont sat back, pleased with his cleverness. The drinks came. He raised his glass. “Your very good health, sir. This sure is my lucky day.”

Bond smiled non-committally and drank.

Mr Du Pont leant forward again. He looked round. There was nobody at the nearby tables. Nevertheless he lowered his voice. “I guess you’ll be saying to yourself, well, it’s nice to see Junius Du Pont again, but what’s the score? Why’s he so particularly happy at seeing me on just this night?” Mr. Du Pont raised his eyebrows as if acting Bond’s part for him. Bond put on a face of polite inquiry. Mr Du Pont leant still farther across the table. “Now, I hope you’ll forgive me, Mr Bond. It’s not like me to pry into other people’s secre… er—affairs. But, after that game at Royale, I did hear that you were not only a grand card player, but also that you were—er—how shall I put it?—that you were a sort of—er—investigator. You know, kind of intelligence operative.” Mr Du Font’s indiscretion had made him go very red in the face. He sat back and took out a handkerchief and wiped his forehead. He looked anxiously at Bond.

Bond shrugged his shoulders. The grey-blue eyes that looked into Mr Du Font’s eyes, which had turned hard and watchful despite his embarrassment, held a mixture of candour, irony and self-deprecation. “I used to dabble in that kind of thing. Hangover from the.war. One still thought it was fun playing Red Indians. But there’s no future in it in peacetime.”

“Quite, quite.” Mr Du Pont made a throwaway gesture with the hand that held the cigarette. His eyes evaded Bond’s as he put the next question, waited for the next lie. Bond thought, there’s a wolf in this Brooks Brothers clothing. This is a shrewd man. “And now you’ve settled down?” Mr Du Pont smiled paternally. “What did you choose, if you’ll pardon the question?”

“Import and Export. I’m with Universal. Perhaps you’ve come across them.”

Mr Du Pont continued to play the game. “Hm. Universal. Let me see. Why, yes, sure I’ve heard of them. Can’t say I’ve ever done business with them, but I guess it’s never too late.” He chuckled fatly. “I’ve got quite a heap of interests all over the place. Only stuff I can honestly say I’m not interested in is chemicals. Maybe it’s my misfortune, Mr Bond, but I’m not one of the chemical Du Fonts.”

Bond decided that the man was quite satisfied with the particular brand of Du Pont he happened to be. He made no comment. He glanced at his watch to hurry Mr Du Font’s play of the hand. He made a note to handle his own cards carefully. Mr Du Pont had a nice pink kindly baby-face with a puckered, rather feminine turn-down mouth. He looked as harmless as any of the middle-aged Americans with cameras who stand outside Buckingham Palace. But Bond sensed many tough, sharp qualities behind the fuddy-duddy facade.

Mr Du Font’s sensitive eye caught Bond’s glance at his watch. He consulted his own. “My, oh my！Seven o’clock and here I’ve been talking away without coming to the point.Now, see here, Mr Bond. I’ve got me a problem on which I’d greatly appreciate your guidance. If you can spare me the time and if you were counting on stopping over in Miami tonight I’d reckon it a real favour if you’d allow me to be your host.” Mr Du Pont held up his hand. “Now, I think I can promise to make you comfortable. So happens I own a piece of the Floridiana. Maybe you heard we opened around Christmas time? Doing a great business I’m happy to say. Really pushing that little old Fountain Blue,” Mr Du Pont laughed indulgently. “That’s what we call the Fontainebleau down here. Now, what do you say, Mr Bond? You shall have the best suite—even if it means putting some good paying customers out on the sidewalk. And you’d be doing me a real favour.” Mr Du Pont looked imploring.

Bond had already decided to accept—blind. Whatever Mr Du Font’s problem—blackmail, gangsters, women—it would be some typical form of rich man’s worry. Here was a slice of the easy life he had been asking for. Take it. Bond started to say something politely deprecating. Mr Du Pont interrupted. “Please, please, Mr Bond. And believe me, I’m grateful, very grateful indeed.” He snapped his fingers for the waitress. When she came, he turned away from Bond and settled the bill out of Bond’s sight. Like many very rich men he considered that showing his money, letting someone see how much he tipped, amounted to indecent exposure. He thrust his roll back into his trousers pocket (the hip pocket is not the place among the rich) and took Bond by the arm. He sensed Bond’s resistance to the contact and removed his hand. They went down the stairs to the main hall.

“Now, let’s just straighten out your reservation.” Mr Du Pont headed for the Transamerica ticket counter. In a few curt phrases Mr Du Pont showed his power and efficiency in his own, his American, realm.

“Yes, Mr Du Pont. Surely, Mr Du Pont. I’ll take care of that, Mr Du Pont.”

Outside, a gleaming Chrysler Imperial sighed up to the kerb. A tough-looking chauffeur in a biscuit-coloured uniform hurried to open the door. Bond stepped in and settled down in the soft upholstery. The interior of the car was deliciously cool, almost cold. The Transamerican representative bustled out with Bond’s suitcase, handed it to the chauffeur and, with a half-bow, went back into the Terminal. “Bill’s on the Beach,” said Mr Du Pont to the chauffeur and the big car slid away through the crowded parking lots and out on to the parkway.

Mr Du Pont settled back. “Hope you like stone crabs, Mr Bond. Ever tried them?”

Bond said he had, that he liked them very much.

Mr Du Pont talked about Bill’s on the Beach and about the relative merits of stone and Alaska crab meat while the Chrysler Imperial sped through downtown Miami, along Biscayne Boulevard and across Biscayne Bay by the Douglas MacArthur Causeway. Bond made appropriate comments, letting himself be carried along on the gracious stream of speed and comfort and rich small-talk.

They drew up at a white-painted, mock-Regency frontage in clapboard and stucco. A scrawl of pink neon said：BILL’S ON THE BEACH. While Bond got out, Mr Du Pont gave his instructions to the chauffeur. Bond heard the words. “The Aloha Suite,” and “If there’s any trouble, tell Mr Fairlie to call me here. Right?”

They went up the steps. Inside, the big room was decorated in white with pink muslin swags over the windows. There were pink lights on the tables. The restaurant was crowded with sunburned people in expensive tropical get-ups.—brilliant garish shirts, jangling gold bangles, dark glasses with jewelled rims, cute native straw hats. There was a confusion of scents. The very smell of bodies that had been all day in the sun came through.

Bill, a pansified Italian, hurried towards them. “Why, Mr Du Pont. Is a pleasure, sir. Little crowded tonight. Soon fix you up. Please this way please.” Holding a large leatherbound menu above his head the man weaved his way between the diners to the best table in the room, a corner table for six. He pulled out two chairs, snapped his ringers for the maitre d’hotel and the wine waiter, spread two menus in front of them, exchanged compliments with Mr Du Pont and left them.

Mr Du Pont slapped his menu shut. He said to Bond, “Now, why don’t you just leave this to me? If there’s anything you don’t like, send it back.” And to the head waiter, “Stone crabs. Not frozen. Fresh. Melted butter. Thick toast. Right?”

“Very good, Mr Du Pont.” The wine waiter, washing his hands, took the waiter’s place.

“Two pints of pink champagne. The Pommery ‘50. Silver tankards. Right?”

“Vairry good, Mr Du Pont. A cocktail to start?”

Mr Du Pont turned to Bond. He smiled and raised his eyebrows.

Bond said, “Vodka martini, please. With a slice of lemon peel.”

“Make it two,” said Mr Du Pont. “Doubles.” The wine waiter hurried off. Mr Du Pont sat back and produced his cigarettes and lighter. He looked round the room, answered one or two waves with a smile and a lift of the hand and glanced at the neighbouring tables. He edged his chair nearer to Bond’s. “Can’t help the noise, I’m afraid,” he said apologetically. “Only come here for the crabs. They’re out of this-world. Hope you’re not allergic to them.Once brought a girl here and fed her crabs and her lips swelled up like cycle tyres.”

Bond was amused at the change in Mr Du Pont—this racy talk, the authority of manner once Mr Du Pont thought he had got Bond on the hook, on his payroll. He was a different man from the shy embarrassed suitor who had solicited Bond at the airport. What did Mr Du Pont want from Bond? It would be coming any minute now, the proposition. Bond said, “I haven’t got any allergies.”

“Good, good.”

There was a pause. Mr Du Pont snapped the lid of his lighter up and down several times. He realized he was making an irritating noise and pushed it away from him. He made up his mind. He said, speaking at his hands on the table in front of him, “You ever play Canasta, Mr Bond?”

“Yes, it’s a good game. I like it.”

“Two-handed Canasta?”

“I have done. It’s not so much fun. If you don’t make a fool of yourself—if neither of you do—it tends to even out. Law of averages in the cards. No chance of making much difference in the play.”

Mr Du Pont nodded emphatically. “Just so. That’s what I’ve said to myself. Over a hundred games or so, two equal players will end up equal. Not such a good game as Gin or Oklahoma, but in a way that’s just what I like about it. You pass the time, you handle plenty of cards, you have your ups and downs, no one gets hurt. Right?”

Bond nodded. The martinis came. Mr Du Pont said to the wine waiter, “Bring two more in ten minutes.” They drank. Mr Du Pont turned and faced Bond. His face was petulant, crumpled. He said, “What would you say, Mr Bond, if I told you I’d lost twenty-five thousand dollars in a week playing two-handed Canasta?” Bond was about to reply. Mr Du Pont held up his hand. “And mark you, I’m a good card player. Member of the Regency Club. Play a lot with people like Charlie Goren, Johnny Crawford—at bridge that is. But what I mean, I know my way around at the card table.” Mr Du Pont probed Bond’s eyes.

“If you’ve been playing with the same man all the time, you’ve been cheated.”

“Exactly.” Mr Du Pont slapped the table-cloth. He sat back. “Exactly. That’s what I said to myself after I’d lost—lost for four whole days. So I said to myself, this bastard is cheating me and by golly I’ll find out how he does it and have him hounded out of Miami. So I doubled the stakes and then doubled them again. He was quite happy about it. And I watched every card he played, every movement. Nothing！Not a hint or a sign. Cards not marked. New pack whenever I wanted one. My own cards. Never looked at my hand—couldn’t, as I always sat dead opposite him. No kibitzer to tip him off. And he just went on winning and winning. Won again this morning. And again this afternoon. Finally I got so mad at the game—I didn’t show it, mind you” Bond might think he had not been a sport—“I paid up politely. But, without telling this guy, I just packed my bag and got me to the airport and booked on the first plane to New York. Think of that！” Mr Du Pont threw up his hands. “Running away. But twenty-five grand is twenty-five grand. I could see it getting to fifty, a hundred. And I just couldn’t stand another of these damned games and I couldn’t stand not being able to catch this guy out. So I took off. What do you think of that? Me, Junius Du Pont, throwing in the towel because I couldn’t take the licking any more！”

Bond grunted sympathetically. The second round of drinks came. Bond was mildly interested, he was always interested in anything to do with cards. He could see the scene, the two men playing and playing and the one man quietly shuffling and dealing away and marking up his score while the other was always throwing his cards into the middle of the table with a gesture of controlled disgust. Mr Du Pont was obviously being cheated. How? Bond said, “Twenty-five thousand’s a lot of money. What stakes were you playing?”

Mr Du Pont looked sheepish. “Quarter a point, then fifty cents, then a dollar. Pretty high I guess with the games averaging around two thousand points. Even at a quarter, that makes five hundred dollars a game. At a dollar a point, if you go on losing, it’s murder.”

“You must have won sometimes.”

“Oh sure, but somehow, just as I’d got the s.o.b. all set for a killing, he’d put down as many of his cards as he could meld. Got out of the bag. Sure, I won some small change, but only when he needed a hundred and twenty to go down and I’d got all the wild cards.But you know how it is with Canasta, you have to discard right. You lay traps to make the other guy hand you the pack. Well, darn it, he seemed to be psychic！Whenever I laid a trap, he’d dodge it, and almost every time he laid one for me I’d fall into it. As for giving me the pack—why, he’d choose the damnedest cards when he was pushed—discard singletons, aces, God knows what, and always get away with it. It was just as if he knew every card in my hand,”

“Any mirrors in the room?”

“Heck, no！We always played outdoors. He said he wanted to get himself a sunburn.Certainly did that. Red as lobster. He’d only play in the mornings and afternoons. Said if he played in the evening he couldn’t get to sleep.”

“Who is this man, anyway? What’s his name?”

“Goldfinger.”

“First name?”

“Auric. That means golden, doesn’t it? He certainly is that. Got flaming red hair.”

“Nationality?”

“You won’t believe it, but he’s a Britisher. Domiciled in Nassau. You’d think he’d be a Jew from the name, but he doesn’t look it. We're restricted at the Floridiana. Wouldn’t have got in if he had been. Nassavian passport. Age forty-two. Unmarried. Profession, broker. Got all this from his passport. Had me a peek via the house detective when I started to play with him.”

“What sort of broker?” Du Pont smiled grimly. “I asked him. He said, “Oh, anything that comes along.” Evasive sort of fellow. Clams up if you ask him a direct question. Talks away quite pleasantly about nothing at all.”

“What’s he worth?”

“Ha！” said Mr Du Pont explosively. “That’s the damnedest thing. He’s loaded. But loaded！I got my bank to check with Nassau. He’s lousy with it. Millionaires are a dime a dozen in Nassau, but he’s rated either first or second among them. Seems he keeps his money in gold bars. Shifts them around the world a lot to get the benefit of changes in the gold price. Acts like a damn federal bank. Doesn’t trust currencies. Can’t say he’s wrong in that, and seeing how he’s one of the richest men in the world there must be something to his system.” But the point is, if he’s as rich as that, what the hell does he want to take a lousy twenty-five grand off me for?

A bustle of waiters round their table saved Bond having to think up a reply. With ceremony, a wide silver dish of crabs, big ones, their shells and claws broken, was placed in the middle of the table. A silver sauceboat brimming with melted butter and a long rack of toast was put beside each of their plates. The tankards of champagne frothed pink. Finally, with an oily smirk, the head waiter came behind their chairs and, in turn, tied round their necks long white silken bibs that reached down to the lap.

Bond was reminded of Charles Laughton playing Henry VIII, but neither Mr Du Pont nor the neighbouring diners seemed surprised at the hoggish display. Mr Du Pont, with a gleeful 'Every man for himself, raked several hunks of crab on to his plate, doused them liberally in melted butter and dug in. Bond followed suit and proceeded to eat, or rather devour, the most delicious meal he had had in his life.

The meat of the stone crabs was the tenderest, sweetest shellfish he had ever tasted. It was perfectly set off by the dry toast and slightly burned taste of the melted butter. The champagne seemed to have the faintest scent of strawberries. It was ice cold. After each helping of crab, the champagne cleaned the palate for the next. They ate steadily and with absorption and hardly exchanged a word until the dish was cleared.

With a slight belch, Mr Du Pont for the last time wiped butter off his chin with his silken bib and sat back. His face was flushed. He looked proudly at Bond. He said reverently, “Mr Bond, I doubt if anywhere in the world a man has eaten as good a dinner as that tonight. What do you say?”

Bond thought, I asked for the easy life, the rich life. How do I like it? How do I like eating like a pig and hearing remarks like that? Suddenly the idea of ever having another meal like this, or indeed any other meal with Mr Du Pont, revolted him. He felt momentarily ashamed of his disgust. He had asked and it had been given. It was the puritan in him that couldn’t take it. He had made his wish and the wish had not only been granted, it had been stuffed down his throat. Bond said, “I don’t know about that, but it was certainly very good.”

Mr Du Pont was satisfied. He called for coffee. Bond refused the offer of cigars or liqueurs. He lit a cigarette and waited with interest for the catch to be presented. He knew there would be one. It was obvious that all this was part of the come-on. Well, let it come.

Mr Du Pont cleared his throat. “And now, Mr Bond, I have a proposition to put to you.” He stared at Bond, trying to gauge his reaction in advance.

“Yes?”

“It surely was providential to meet you like that at the airport.” Mr Du Font’s voice was grave, sincere. “I’ve never forgotten our first meeting at Royale. I recall every detail of it—your coolness, your daring, your handling of the cards.” Bond looked down at the tablecloth. But Mr Du Pont had got tired of his peroration. He said hurriedly, “Mr Bond, I will pay you ten thousand dollars to stay here as my guest until you have discovered how this man Goldfinger beats me at cards.”

Bond looked Mr Du Pont in the eye. He said, “That’s a handsome offer, Mr Du Pont. But I have to get back to London. I must be in New York to catch my plane within forty-eight hours. If you will play your usual sessions tomorrow morning and afternoon I should have plenty of time to find out the answer. But I must leave tomorrow night, whether I can help you or not.Done?” “Done,” said Mr Du Pont.





CHAPTER THREE THE MAN WITH AGORAPHOBIA


THE FLAPPING of the curtains wakened Bond. He threw off the single sheet and walked across the thick pile carpet to the picture window that filled the whole of one wall. He drew back the curtains and went out on to the sun-filled balcony.

The black and white chequer-board tiles were warm, almost hot to the feet although it could not yet be eight o’clock. A brisk inshore breeze was blowing off the sea, straining the flags of all nations that flew along the pier of the private yacht basin. The breeze was humid and smelt strongly of the sea. Bond guessed it was the breeze that the visitors like, but the residents hate. It would rust the metal fittings in their homes, fox the pages of their books, rot their wallpaper and pictures, breed damp-rot in their clothes.

Twelve storeys down the formal gardens, dotted with palm trees and beds of bright croton and traced with neat gravel walks between avenues of bougainvillaea, were rich and dull. Gardeners were working, raking the paths and picking up leaves with the lethargic slow motion of coloured help. Two mowers were at work on the lawns and, where they had already been, sprinklers were gracefully flinging handfuls of spray.

Directly below Bond, the elegant curve of the Cabana Club swept down to the beach—two storeys of changing-rooms below a flat roof dotted with chairs and tables and an occasional red and white striped umbrella. Within the curve was the brilliant green oblong of the Olympic-length swimming-pool fringed on all sides by row upon row of mattressed steamer chairs on which the customers would soon be getting their fifty-dollar-a-day sunburn. White-jacketed men were working among them, straightening the lines of chairs, turning the mattresses and sweeping up yesterday’s cigarette butts. Beyond was the long, golden beach and the sea, and more men—raking the tideline, putting up the umbrellas, laying out mattresses. No wonder the neat card inside Bond’s wardrobe had said that the cost of the Aloha Suite was two hundred dollars a day. Bond made a rough calculation. If he was paying the bill, it would take him just three weeks to spend his whole salary for the year. Bond smiled cheerfully to himself. He went back into the bedroom, picked up the telephone and ordered himself a delicious, wasteful breakfast, a carton of king-size Chesterfields and the newspapers.

By the time he had shaved and had an ice-cold shower and dressed it was eight o’clock. He walked through into the elegant sitting-room and found a waiter in a uniform of plum and gold laying out his breakfast beside the window. Bond glanced at the Miami Herald. The front page was devoted to yesterday’s failure of an American ICBM at the nearby Cape Canaveral and a bad upset in a big race at Hialeah.

Bond dropped the paper on the floor and sat down and slowly ate his breakfast and thought about Mr Du Pont and Mr Goldfinger.

His thoughts were inconclusive. Mr Du Pont was either a much worse player than he thought, which seemed unlikely on Bond’s reading of his tough, shrewd character, or else Goldfinger was a cheat. If Goldfinger cheated at cards, although he didn’t need the money, it was certain that he had also made himself rich by cheating or sharp practice on a much bigger scale. Bond was interested in big crooks. He looked forward to his first sight of Goldfinger. He also looked forward to penetrating Goldfinger’s highly successful and, on the face of it, highly mysterious method of fleecing Mr Du Pont. It was going to be a most entertaining day. Idly Bond waited for it to get under way.

The plan was that he would meet Mr Du Pont in the garden at ten o’clock. The story would be that Bond had flown down from New York to try and sell Mr Du Pont a block of shares from an English holding in a Canadian Natural Gas property. The matter was clearly confidential and Goldfinger would not think of questioning Bond about details. Shares, Natural Gas, Canada. That was all Bond needed to remember. They would go along together to the roof of the Cabana Club where the game was played and Bond would read his paper and watch. After luncheon, during which Bond and Mr Du Pont would discuss their “business”, there would be the same routine. Mr Du Pont had inquired if there was anything else he could arrange. Bond had asked for the number of Mr Goldfinger’s suite and a passkey. He had explained that if Goldfinger was any kind of a professional card-sharp, or even an expert amateur, he would travel with the usual tools of the trade—marked and shaved cards, the apparatus for the Short Arm Delivery, and so forth. Mr Du Pont had said he would give Bond the key when they met in the garden. He would have no difficulty getting one from the manager.

After breakfast, Bond relaxed and gazed into the middle distance of the sea. He was not keyed up by the job on hand, only interested and amused. It was just the kind of job he had needed to clear his palate after Mexico.

At half past nine Bond left his suite and wandered along the corridors of his floor, getting lost on his way to the elevator in order to reconnoitre the lay-out of the hotel. Then, having met the same maid twice, he asked his way and went down in the elevator and moved among the scattering of early risers through the Pineapple Shopping Arcade. He glanced into the Bamboo Coffee Shoppe, the Rendezvous Bar, the La Tropicala dining-room, the Kittekat Klub for children and the Boom-Boom Nighterie. He then went purposefully out into the garden. Mr Du Pont, now dressed ‘for the beach’ by Abercrombie & Fitch, gave him the pass-key to Goldfinger’s suite. They sauntered over to the Cabana Club and climbed the two short flights of stairs to the top deck.

Bond’s first view of Mr Goldfinger was startling. At the far corner of the roof, just below the cliff of the hotel, a man was lying back with his legs up on a steamer chair. He was wearing nothing but a yellow satin bikini slip, dark glasses and a pair of wide tin wings under his chin. The wings, which appeared to fit round his neck, stretched out across his shoulders and beyond them and then curved up slightly to rounded tips.

Bond said, “What the hell’s he wearing round his neck?”

“You never seen one of those?”Mr Du Pont was surprised. “That’s a gadget to help your tan. Polished tin. Reflects the sun up under your chin and behind the ears—the bits that wouldn’t normally catch the sun.”

“Well, well,”said Bond.

When they were a few yards from the reclining figure Mr Du Pont called out cheerfully, in what seemed to Bond an overloud voice, “Hi there！”Mr Goldfinger did not stir.

Mr Du Pont said in his normal voice. “He’s very deaf.”They were now at Mr Goldfinger’s feet. Mr Du Pont repeated his hail.

Mr Goldfinger sat up sharply. He removed his dark glasses. “Why, hullo there.”He unhitched the wings from round his neck, put them carefully on the ground beside him and got heavily to his feet. He looked at Bond with slow, inquiring eyes.

“Like you to meet Mr Bond, James Bond. Friend of mine from New York. Countryman of yours. Come down to try and talk me into a bit of business.”

Mr Goldfinger held out a hand. “Pleased to meet you, Mr Bomb.”

Bond took the hand. It was hard and dry. There was the briefest pressure and it was withdrawn. For an instant Mr Goldfinger’s pale, china-blue eyes opened wide and stared hard at Bond. They stared right through his face to the back of his skull. Then the lids drooped, the shutter closed over the X-ray, and Mr Goldfinger took the exposed plate and slipped it away in his filing system.

“So no game today.”The voice was flat, colourless. The words were more of a statement than a question.

“Whaddya mean, no game?”shouted Mr Du Pont boisterously. “You weren’t thinking I’d let you hang on to my money? Got to get it back or I shan’t be able to leave this darned hotel,”Mr Du Pont chuckled richly. “I’ll tell Sam to fix the table. James here says he doesn’t know much about cards and he’d like to learn the game. That right, James?”He turned to Bond. “Sure you’ll be all right with your paper and the sunshine?”

“I’d be glad of the rest,”said Bond. “Been travelling too much.”

Again the eyes bored into Bond and then drooped. Til get some clothes on. I had intended to have a golf lesson this afternoon from Mr Armour at the Boca Raton. But cards have priority among my hobbies. My tendency to un-cock the wrists too early with the mid-irons will have to wait.”The eyes rested incuriously on Bond. “You play golf, Mr Bomb?”

Bond raised his voice. “Occasionally, when I’m in England.”

“And where do you play?”

“Huntercombe.”

“Ah—a pleasant little course. I have recently joined the Royal St Marks. Sandwich is close to one of my business interests. You know it?”

“I have played there.”

“What is your handicap?”

“Nine.”

“That is a coincidence. So is mine. We must have a game one day.”Mr Goldfinger bent down and picked up his tin wings. He said to Mr Du Pont, “I will be with you in five minutes.”He walked slowly off towards the stairs.

Bond was amused. This social sniffing at him had been done with just the right casual touch of the tycoon who didn’t really care if Bond was alive or dead but, since he was there and alive, might as well place him in an approximate category.

Mr Du Pont gave instructions to a steward in a white coat. Two others were already setting up a card table. Bond walked to the rail that surrounded the roof and looked down into the garden, reflecting on Mr Goldfinger.

He was impressed. Mr Goldfinger was one of the most relaxed men Bond had ever met.

It showed in the economy of his movement, of his speech, of his expressions. Mr Goldfinger wasted no effort, yet there was something coiled, compressed, in the immobility of the man.

When Goldfinger had stood up, the first thing that had struck Bond was that everything was out of proportion. Goldfinger was short, not more than five feet tall, and on top of the thick body and blunt, peasant legs, was set almost directly into the shoulders, a huge and it seemed exactly round head. It was as if Goldfinger had been put together with bits of other people’s bodies. Nothing seemed to belong. Perhaps, Bond thought, it was to conceal his ugliness that Goldfinger made such a fetish of sunburn. Without the red-brown camouflage the pale body would be grotesque. The face, under the cliff of crew-cut carroty hair, was as startling, without being as ugly, as the body. It was moon-shaped without being moonlike. The forehead was fine and high and the thin sandy brows were level above the large light blue eyes fringed with pale lashes. The nose was fleshily aquiline between high cheekbones and cheeks that were more muscular than fat. The mouth was thin and dead straight, but beautifully drawn. The chin and jaws were firm and glinted with health. To sum up, thought Bond, it was the face of a thinker, perhaps a scientist, who was ruthless, sensual, stoical and tough. An odd combination.

What else could he guess? Bond always mistrusted short men. They grew up from childhood with an inferiority complex. All their lives they would strive to be big—bigger than the others who had teased them as a child. Napoleon had been short, and Hitler. It was the short men that caused all the trouble in the world. And what about a misshapen short man with red hair and a bizarre face? That might add up to a really formidable misfit. One could certainly feel the repressions. There was a powerhouse of vitality humming in the man that suggested that if one stuck an electric bulb into Goldfinger’s mouth it would light up. Bond smiled at the thought. Into what channels did Goldfinger release his vital force? Into getting rich? Into sex? Into power? Probably into all three. What could his history be? Today he might be an Englishman. What had he been born? Not a Jew—though there might be Jewish blood in him. Not a Latin or anything farther south. Not a Slav. Perhaps a German—no, a Bait！That’s where he would have come from. One of the old Baltic provinces. Probably got away to escape the Russians. Goldfinger would have been warned—or his parents had smelled trouble and they had got him out in time. And what had happened then? How had he worked his way up to being one of the richest men in the world? One day it might be interesting to find out. For the time being it would be enough to find out how he won at cards.

“All set?”Mr Du Pont called to Goldfinger who was coming across the roof towards the card table. With his clothes on—a comfortably fitting dark blue suit, a white shirt open at the neck—Goldfinger cut an almost passable figure.

But there was no disguise for the great brown and red football of a head and the fleshcoloured hearing aid plugged into the left ear was net an improvement.

Mr Du Pont sat with his back to the hotel. Goldfinger took the seat opposite and cut the cards. Du Pont won the cut, pushed the other pack over to Goldfinger, tapped them to show they were already shuffled and he couldn’t bother to cut, and Goldfinger began the deal.

Bond sauntered over and took a chair at Mr Du Font’s elbow. He sat back, relaxed. He made a show of folding his paper to the sports page and watched the deal.

Somehow Bond had expected it, but this was no card-sharp. Goldfinger dealt quickly and efficiently, but with no hint of the Mechanic’s Grip, those vital three fingers curled round the long edge of the cards and the index finger at the outside short upper edge—the grip that means you are armed for dealing Bottoms or Seconds. And he wore no signet ring for pricking the cards, no surgical tape round a finger for marking them.

Mr Du Pont turned to Bond. “Deal of fifteen cards,”he commented. “You draw two and discard one. Otherwise straight Regency rules. No monkey business with the red treys counting one, three, five, eight, or any of that European stuff.”Mr Du Pont picked up his cards. Bond noticed that he sorted them expertly, not grading them according to value from left to right, or holding his wild cards, of which he had two, at the left—a pattern that might help a watchful opponent. Mr Du Pont concentrated his good cards in the centre of his hand with the singletons and broken melds on either side.

The game began. Mr Du Pont drew first, a miraculous pair of wild cards. His face betrayed nothing. He discarded casually. He only needed two more good draws to go out unseen. But he would have to be lucky. Drawing two cards doubles the chance of picking up what you want, but it also doubles the chance of picking up useless cards that will only clutter up your hand.

Goldfinger played a more deliberate game, almost irritatingly slow. After drawing, he shuffled through his cards again and again before deciding on his discard.

On the third draw, Du Pont had improved his hand to the extent that he now needed only one of five cards to go down and out and catch his opponent with a handful of cards which would all count against him. As if Goldfinger knew the danger he was in, he went down for fifty and proceeded to make a canasta with three wild cards and four fives. He also got rid of some more melds and ended with only four cards in his hand. In any other circumstances it would have been ridiculously bad play. As it was, he had made some four hundred points instead of losing over a hundred, for, on the next draw Mr Du Pont filled his hand and, with most of the edge taken off his triumph by Goldfinger’s escape, went down unseen with the necessary two canastas.

“By golly, I nearly screwed you that time.”Mr Du Font’s voice had an edge of exasperation. “What in hell told you to cut an’ run?”

Goldfinger said indifferently, “I smelled trouble.”He added up his points, announced them and jotted them down, waiting for Mr Du Pont to do the same. Then he cut the cards and sat back and regarded Bond with polite interest.

“Will you be staying long, Mr Bomb?”

Bond smiled. “It’s Bond, B-O-N-D. No, I have to go back to New York tonight.”

“How sad.”Goldfinger’s mouth pursed in polite regret. He turned back to the cards and the game went on. Bond picked up his paper and gazed, unseeing, at the baseball scores, while he listened to the quiet routine of the game. Goldfinger won that hand and the next and the next. He won the game. There was a difference of one thousand five hundred points—one thousand five hundred dollars to Goldfinger.

“There it goes again！”It was the plaintive voice of Mr Du Pont.

Bond put down his paper. “Does he usually win?”

“Usually！”The word was a snort. “He always wins.”They cut again and Goldfinger began to deal.

Bond said, “Don’t you cut for seats? I often find a change of seat helps the luck. Hostage to fortune and so on.”

Goldfinger paused in his deal. He bent his gaze gravely on Bond. “Unfortunately, Mr Bond, that is not possible or I could not play. As I explained to Mr Du Pont at our first game, I suffer from an obscure complaint—agoraphobia—the fear of open spaces. I cannot bear the open,horizon. I must sit and face the hotel.”The deal continued.

“Oh, I’m so sorry.”Bond’s voice was grave, interested. “That’s a very rare disability. I’ve always been able to understand claustrophobia, but not the other way round. How did it come about?”

Goldfinger picked up his cards and began to arrange his hand. “I have no idea,”he said equably.

Bond got up. “Well, I think I’ll stretch my legs for a bit. See what’s going on in the pool.”

“You do just that,”said Mr Du Pont jovially. “Just take it easy, James. Plenty of time to discuss business over lunch. I’ll see if I can’t dish it out to my friend Goldfinger this time instead of taking it. Be seeing you.”

Goldfinger didn’t look up from his cards. Bond strolled down the roof, past the occasional splayed-out body, to the rail at the far end that overlooked the pool. For a time he stood and contemplated the ranks of pink and brown and white flesh laid out below him on the steamer chairs. The heavy scent of suntan oil came up to him. There were a few children and young people in the pool. A man, obviously a professional diver, perhaps the swimming instructor, stood on the high-dive. He balanced on the balls of his feet, a muscled Greek god with golden hair. He bounced once, casually, and flew off and down, his arms held out like wings. Lazily they arrowed out to cleave the water for the body to pass through. The impact left only a brief turbulence. The diver jack-knifed up again, shaking his head boyishly. There was a smattering of applause. The man trudged slowly down the pool, his head submerged, his shoulders moving with casual power. Bond thought, good luck to you！You won’t be able to keep this up for more than another five or six years. High-divers couldn’t take it for long—the repeated shock to the skull. With ski-jumping, which had the same shattering effect on the frame, high-diving was the shortest-lived sport. Bond radioed to the diver, “Cash in quick！Get into films while the hair’s still gold.”

Bond turned and looked back down the roof towards the two Canasta players beneath the cliff of the hotel. So Goldfinger liked to face the hotel. Or was it that he liked Mr Du Pont to have his back to it? And why? Now, what was the number of Goldfinger’s suite? No 200, the Hawaii Suite. Bond’s on the top floor was 1200. So, all things being equal, Goldfinger’s would be directly below Bond’s, on the second floor, twenty yards or so above the roof of the Cabana Club—twenty yards from the card table. Bond counted down. He closely examined the frontage that should be Goldfinger’s. Nothing. An empty sun balcony. An open door into the dark interior of the suite. Bond measured distances, angles. Yes, that’s how it might be. That’s how it must be！Clever Mr Goldfinger！





CHAPTER FOUR OVER THE BARREL


AFTER LUNCHEON—the traditional shrimp cocktail, “native”snapper with a minute paper cup of tartare sauce, roast prime ribs of beef au jus, and pineapple surprise—it was time for the siesta before meeting Goldfinger at three o’clock for the afternoon session.

Mr Du Pont, who had lost a further ten thousand dollars or more, confirmed that Goldfinger had a secretary. “Never seen her. Sticks to the suite. Probably just some chorine he’s brought down for the ride.”He smiled wetly. “I mean the daily ride. Why? You on to something?”

Bond was non-committal. “Can’t tell yet. I probably won’t be coming down this afternoon. Say I got bored watching-gone into the town.”He paused. “But if my idea’s right, don’t be surprised at what may happen. If Goldfinger starts to behave oddly, just sit quiet and watch. I’m not promising anything. I think I’ve got him, but I may be wrong.”

Mr Du Pont was enthusiastic. “Good for you, boyo！”he said effusively. “I just can’t wait to see that bastard over the barrel. Damn his eyes！”

Bond took the elevator up to his suite. He went to his suitcase and extracted an M3 Leica, an MC exposure meter, a K2 filter and a flash-holder. He put a bulb in the holder and checked the camera. He went to his balcony, glanced at the sun to estimate where it would be at about three-thirty and went back into the sitting-room, leaving the door to the balcony open. He stood at the balcony door and aimed the exposure meter. The exposure was one-hundredth of a second. He set this on the Leica, put the shutter at f 11, and the distance at twelve feet. He clipped on a lens hood and took one picture to see that all was working. Then he wound on the film, slipped in the flash-holder and put the camera aside.

Bond went to his suitcase and took out a thick book—The Bible Designed to be Read as Literature—opened it and extracted his Walther PPK in the Berns Martin holster. He slipped the holster inside his trouser band to the left. He tried one or two quick draws. They were satisfactory. He closely examined the geography of his suite, on the assumption that it would be exactly similar to the Hawaii. He visualized the scene that would almost certainly greet him when he came through the door of the suite downstairs. He tried his pass-key in the various locks and practised opening the doors noiselessly. Then he pulled a comfortable chair in front of the open balcony door and sat and smoked a cigarette while he gazed out across the sea and thought of how he would put things to Goldfinger when the time came.

At three-fifteen, Bond got up and went out on to the balcony and cautiously looked down at the two tiny figures across the square of green baize. He went back into the room and checked the exposure meter on the Leica. The light was the same. He slipped on the coat of his dark blue tropical worsted suit, straightened his tie and slung the strap of the Leica round his neck so that the camera hung at his chest. Then, with a last look round, he went out and along to the elevator. He rode down to the ground floor and examined the shop windows in the foyer. When the elevator had gone up again, he walked to the staircase and slowly climbed up two floors. The geography of the second floor was identical with the twelfth. Room 200 was where he had expected it to be. There was no one in sight. He took out his pass-key and silently opened the door and closed it behind him. In the small lobby, a raincoat, a light camel-hair coat and a pale grey Homburg hung on hooks. Bond took his Leica firmly in his right hand, held it up close to his face and gently tried the door to the sitting-room：It was not locked. Bond eased it open.

Even before he could see what he expected to see he could hear the voice. It was a low, attractive, girl’s voice, an English voice. It was saying, “Drew five and four. Completed canasta in fives with two twos. Discarding four. Has singletons in king’s, knaves, nines, sevens.”

Bond slid into the room.

The girl was sitting on two cushions on top of a table which had been pulled up a yard inside the open balcony door. She had needed the cushions to give her height. It was at the top of the afternoon heat and she was naked except for a black brassiere and black silk briefs. She was swinging her legs in a bored fashion. She had just finished painting the nails on her left hand. Now she stretched the hand out in front of her to examine the effect. She brought the hand back close to her lips and blew on the nails. Her right hand reached sideways and put the brush back in the Revlon bottle on the table beside her. A few inches from her eyes were the eyepieces of a powerful-looking pair of binoculars supported on a tripod whose feet reached down between her sunburned legs to the floor. Jutting out from below the binoculars was a microphone from which wires led to a box about the size of a portable record player under the table. Other wires ran from the box to a gleaming indoor aerial on the sideboard against the wall.

The briefs tightened as she leant forward again and put her eyes to the binoculars. “Drew a queen and a king. Meld of queens. Can meld kings with a joker. Discarding seven.”She switched off the microphone.

While she was concentrating, Bond stepped swiftly across the floor until he was almost behind her. There was a chair. He stood on it, praying it wouldn’t squeak. Now he had the height to get the whole scene in focus. He put his eye to the viewfinder. Yes, there it was, all in line, the girl’s head, the edge of the binoculars, the microphone and, twenty yards below, the two men at the table with Mr Du Font’s hand of cards held in front of him. Bond could distinguish the reds and the blacks. He pressed the button.

The sharp explosion of the bulb and the blinding flash of light forced a quick scream out of the girl. She swivelled round.

Bond stepped down off the chair. “Good afternoon.”

“Whoryou? Whatyouwant?”The girl’s hand was up to her mouth. Her eyes screamed at him.

“I’ve got what I want. Don’t worry. It’s all over now. And my jmme’s Bond, James Bond.”

Bond put his camera carefully down on the chair and came and stood in the radius of her scent. She was very beautiful. She had the palest blonde hair. It fell heavily to her shoulders, unfashionably long. Her eyes were deep blue against a lightly sunburned skin and her mouth was bold and generous and would have a lovely smile.

She stood up and took her hand away from her mouth. She was tall, perhaps five feet ten, and her arms and legs looked firm as if she might be a swimmer. Her breasts thrust against the black silk of the brassiere.

Some of the fear had gone out of her eyes. She said in a low voice, “What are you going to do?”

“Nothing to you. I may tease Goldfinger a bit. Move over like a good girl and let me have a look.”

Bond took the girl’s place and looked through the glasses. The game was going on normally. Goldfinger showed no sign that his communications had broken down.

“Doesn’t he mind not getting the signals? Will he stop playing?”

She said hesitatingly, “It’s happened before when a plug pulled or something. He just waits for me to come through again.”

Bond smiled at her. “Well, let’s let him stew for a bit. Have a cigarette and relax,”he held out a packet of Chesterfields. She took one.

“Anyway it’s time you did the nails on your right hand.”A smile flickered across her mouth. “How long were you there? You gave me a frightful shock.”

“Not long, and I’m sorry about the shock. Goldfinger’s been giving poor old Mr Du Pont shocks for a whole week.”

“Yes,”she said doubtfully. “I suppose it’s really rather mean. But he’s very rich, isn’t he?”

“Oh yes. I shouldn’t lose any sleep over Mr Du Pont. But Goldfinger might choose someone who can’t afford it. Anyway, he’s a millionaire himself. Why does he do it? He’s crawling with money.”

Animation flooded back into her face. “I know. I simply can’t understand him. It’s a sort of mania with him, making money. He can’t leave it alone. I’ve asked him why and all he says is that one’s a fool not to make money when the odds are right. He’s always going on about the same thing, getting the odds right. When he talked me into doing this,”she waved her cigarette dt the binoculars, “and I asked him why on earth he bothered, took these stupid risks, all he said was, ‘That’s the second lesson. When the odds aren’t right, make them right.’”

Bond said, “Well, it’s lucky for him I’m not Pinkertons or the Miami Police Department.”

The girl shrugged her shoulders. “Oh, that wouldn’t worry him. He’d just buy you off. He can buy anyone off. No one can resist gold.”

“What do you mean?”

She said indifferently, “He always carries a million dollars worth of gold about with him except when he’s going through the Customs. Then he just carries a belt full of gold coins round his stomach. Otherwise it’s in thin sheets in the bottom and sides of his suitcases. They’re really gold suitcases covered with leather.”

“They must weigh a ton.”

“He always travels by car, one with special springs. And his chauffeur is a huge man. He carries them. No one else touches them.”

“Why does he carry around all that gold?”

“Just in case he needs it. He knows that gold will buy him anything he wants. It’s all twenty-four carat. And anyway he loves gold, really loves it like people love jewels or stamps or—well,”she smiled, “women.”

Bond smiled back. “Does he love you?”She blushed and said indignantly, “Certainly not.”Then, more reasonably, “Of course you can think anything you like. But really he doesn’t. I mean, I think he likes people to think that we—that I’m—that it’s a question of love and all that. You know. He’s not very prepossessing and I suppose it’s a question of—well—of vanity or something.”

“Yes, I see. So you’re just a kind of secretary?”

“Companion,”she corrected him. “I don’t have to type or anything.”She suddenly put her hand up to her mouth. “Oh, but I shouldn’t be telling you all this！You won’t tell him, will you? He’d fire me.”Fright came into her eyes. “Or something. I don’t know what he’d do. He’s the sort of man who might do anything.”

“Of course I won’t tell. But this can’t be much of a life for you. Why do you do it?”

She said tartly, “A hundred pounds a week and all this,”she waved at the room,”doesn’t grow on trees. I save up. When I’ve saved enough I shall go.”

Bond wondered if Goldfinger would let her. Wouldn’t she know too much? He looked at the beautiful face, the splendid, unselfconscious body. She might not suspect it, but, for his money, she was in very bad trouble with this man.

The girl was fidgeting. Now she said with an embarrassed laugh, “I don’t think I’m very properly dressed. Can’t I go and put something on over these?”

Bond wasn’t sure he could trust her. It wasn’t he who was paying the hundred pounds a week. He said airily, “You look fine. Just as respectable as those hundreds of people round the pool. Anyway,”he stretched, “it’s about time to fight a fire under Mr Goldfinger.”

Bond had been glancing down at the game from time to time. It seemed to be proceeding normally. Bond bent again to the binoculars. Already Mr Du Pont seemed to be a new man, his gestures were expansive, the half-profile of his pink face was full of animation. While Bond watched, he took a fistful of cards out of his hand and spread them down—a pure canasta in kings. Bond tilted the binoculars up an inch. The big redbrown moon face was impassive, uninterested. Mr Goldfinger was waiting patiently for the odds to adjust themselves back in his favour. While Bond watched, he put up a hand to the hearing aid, pushing the amplifier more firmly into his ear, ready for the signals to come through again.

Bond stepped back. “Neat little machine,”he commented. "What are you transmitting on?”

“He told me, but I can’t remember.”She screwed up her eyes. “A hundred and seventy somethings. Would it be mega-somethings?”

“Megacycles. Might be, but I’d be surprised if he doesn’t get a lot of taxicabs and police messages mixed up with your talk. Must have fiendish concentration.”Bond grinned. “Now then. All set? It’s time to pull the rug away.”

Suddenly she reached out and put a hand on his sleeve. There was a Claddagh ring on the middle finger—two gold hands clasped round a gold heart. There were tears in her voice. “Must you? Can’t you leave him alone? I don’t know what he’ll do to me. Please.”She hesitated. She was blushing furiously. “And I like you. It’s a long time since I’ve seen someone like you. Couldn’t you just stay here for a little more?”She looked down at the ground. “If only you’d leave him alone I’d do—the words came out in a rush—‘I’d do anything.”

Bond smiled. He took the girl’s hand off his arm and squeezed it. “Sorry. I’m being paid to do this job and I must do it. Anyway,”his voice went flat—“I want to do it. It’s time someone cut Mr Goldfinger down to size. Ready?”

Without waiting for an answer he bent to the binoculars. They were still focused on Goldfinger. Bond cleared his throat. He watched the big face carefully. His hand felt for the microphone switch and pressed it down.

There must have been a whisper of static in the deaf aid. Goldfinger’s expression didn’t alter, but he slowly raised his face to heaven and then down again, as if in benediction.

Bond spoke softly, menacingly into the microphone. “Now hear me, Goldfinger.”He paused. Not a flicker of expression, but Goldfinger bent his head a fraction as if listening. He studied his cards intently, his hands quite still.

“This is James Bond speaking. Remember me? The game’s finished and it’s time to pay. I have a photograph of the whole set-up, blonde, binoculars, microphone and you and your hearing aid. This photograph will not go to the FBI and Scotland Yard so long as you obey me exactly. Nod your head if you understand.”

The face was still expressionless. Slowly the big round head bent forward and then straightened itself.

“Put your cards down face upwards on the table.”

The hands went down. They opened and the cards slid off the fingers on to the table.

“Take out your cheque book and write a cheque to cash for fifty thousand dollars. That is made up as follows, thirty-five you have taken from Mr Du Pont. Ten for my fee. The extra five for wasting so much of Mr Du pont’s valuable time.”

Bond watched to see that his order was being obeyed. He took a glance at Mr Du Pont. Mr Du Pont was leaning forward, gaping.

Mr Goldfinger slowly detached the cheque and countersigned it on the back.

“Right. Now jot this down on the back of your cheque book and see you get it right. Book me a compartment on the Silver Meteor to New York tonight. Have a bottle of vintage champagne on ice in the compartment and plenty of caviar sandwiches. The best caviar. And keep away from me. And no monkey business. The photograph will be in the mails with a full report to be opened and acted upon if I don’t show up in good health in New York tomorrow. Nod if you understand.”

Again the big head came slowly down and up again. Now there were traces of sweat on the high, unlined forehead.

“Right, now hand the cheque across to Mr Du Pont and say, ‘I apologize humbly. I have been cheating you.’ Then you can go.”

Bond watched the hand go across and drop the cheque in front of Mr Du Pont. The mouth opened and spoke. The eyes were placid, slow. Goldfinger had relaxed. It was only money. He had paid his way out.

“Just a moment, Goldfinger, you’re not through yet.”Bond glanced up at the girl. She was looking at him strangely. There was misery and fear but also a look of submissiveness, of longing.

“What’s your name?”

“Jill Masterton.”

Goldfinger had stood up, was turning away. Bond said sharply, “Stop.”Goldfinger stopped in mid-stride. Now his eyes looked up at the balcony. They had opened wide, as when Bond had first met him. Their hard, level, X-ray gaze seemed to find the lenses of the binoculars, travel down them and through Bond’s eyes to the back of his skull. They seemed to say, “I shall remember this, Mr Bond.”

Bond said softly, “I’d forgotten. One last thing. I shall be taking a hostage for the ride to New York. Miss Masterton. See that she’s at the train. Oh, and make that compartment a drawing-room. That’s all.”





CHAPTER FIVE NIGHT DUTY


IT WAS a week later. Bond stood at the open window of the seventh-floor office of the tall building in Regent’s Park that is the headquarters of the Secret Service. London lay asleep under a full moon that rode swiftly over the town through a shoal of herring-bone clouds. Big Ben sounded three. One of the telephones rang in the dark room. Bond turned and moved quickly to the central desk and the pool of light cast by the green shaded reading-lamp. He picked up the black telephone from the rank of four.

He said, “Duty officer.”

“Station H, sir.”

“Put them on.”

There was the echoing buzz and twang of the usual bad radio connection with Hongkong. Why were there always sunspots over China? A sing-song voice asked, “Universal Export?”

“Yes.”

A deep, close voice—London—said, “You’re through to Hongkong. Speak up, please.”

Bond said impatiently, “Clear the line, please.”The sing-song voice said, “You’re through now. Speak up, please.”

“Hullo！Hullo！Universal Export?”

“Yes.”

“Dickson speaking. Can you hear me?”

“Yes.”

“That cable I sent you about the shipment of mangoes. Fruit. You know?”

“Yes. Got it here.”Bond pulled the file towards him. He knew what it was about. Station H wanted some limpet mines to put paid to three Communist spy junks that were using Macao to intercept British freighters and search them for refugees from China.

“Must have payment by the tenth.”

That would mean that the junks were leaving, or else that the guards on the junks would be doubled after that date, or some other emergency.

Bond said briefly, “Wilco.”

“Thanks. Bye.”

“Bye.”Bond put down the receiver. He picked up the green receiver and dialled Q Branch and talked to the section duty officer. It would be all right. There was a BOAC Britannia leaving in the morning. Q Branch would see that the crate caught the plane.

Bond sat back. He reached for a cigarette and lit it. He thought of the badly airconditioned little office on the waterfront in Hong kong, saw the sweat marks on the white shirt of 279, whom he knew well and who had just called himself Dickson. Now 279 would probably be talking to his number two “It’s okay. London says can do. Let’s just go over this ops. schedule again.”Bond smiled wryly. Better they than he. He’d never liked being up against the Chinese. There were too many of them. Station H might be stirring up a hornets’ nest, but M had decided it was time to show the opposition that the Service in Hong kong hadn’t quite gone out of business.

When, three days before, M had first told him his name was down for night duty, Bond hadn’t taken to the idea. He had argued that he didn’t know enough about the routine work of the stations, that it was too responsible a job to give a man who had been in the double—O section for six years and who had forgotten all he had ever known about station work.

“You’ll soon pick it up,”M had said unsympathetically. “If you get in trouble there are the duty section officers or the Chief of Staff—or me, for the matter of that.”(Bond had smiled at the thought of waking M up in the middle of the night because some man in Cairo or Tokyo was in a flap.) “Anyway, I’ve decided. I want all senior officers to do their spell of routine.”M had looked frostily across at Bond. “Matter of fact, 007, I had the Treasury on to me the other day. Their liaison man thinks the double-O section is redundant. Says that kind of thing is out of date. I couldn’t bother to argue”—M’s voice was mild. “Just told him he was mistaken.”(Bond could visualize the scene.) “However, won’t do any harm for you to have some extra duties now you’re back in London. Keep you from getting stale.”

And Bond wasn’t minding it. He was half way through his first week and so far it had just been a question of common sense or passing routine problems on down to the sections. He rather liked the peaceful room and knowing everybody’s secrets and being occasionally fed coffee and sandwiches by one of the pretty girls from the canteen.

On the first night the girl had brought him tea. Bond had looked at her severely. “I don’t drink tea. I hate it. It’s mud. Moreover it’s one of the main reasons for the downfall of the British Empire. Be a good girl and make me some coffee.”The girl had giggled and scurried off to spread Bond’s dictum in the canteen. From then on he had got his coffee. The expression “a cup of mud”was seeping through the building.

A second reason why Bond enjoyed the long vacuum of night duty was that it gave him time to get on with a project he had been toying with for more than a year—a handbook of all secret methods of unarmed combat. It was to be called Stay Alive！It would contain the best of all that had been written on the subject by the Secret Services of the world. Bond had told no one of the project, but he hoped that, if he could finish it, M would allow it to be added to the short list of Service manuals which contained the tricks and techniques of Secret Intelligence.

Bond had borrowed the original textbooks, or where necessary, translations, from Records. Most of the books had been captured from enemy agents or organizations. Some. had been presented to M by sister Services such as OSS, CIA and the Deuxieme. Now Bond drew towards him a particular prize, a translation of the manual, entitled simply Defence, issued to operatives of SMERSH, the Soviet organization of vengeance and death.

That night he was half way through Chapter Two, whose title, freely translated, was “Come-along and Restraint Holds”. Now he went back to the book and read for half an hour through the sections dealing with the conventional “Wrist Come-along,”“Arm Lock Come-along,”“Forearm Lock,”“Head Hold”and “Use of Neck Pressure Points”.

After half an hour, Bond thrust the typescript away from him. He got up and went across to the window and stood looking out. There was a nauseating toughness in the blunt prose the Russians used. It had brought on another of the attacks of revulsion to which Bond had succumbed ten days before at Miami airport. What was wrong with him?

Couldn’t he take it any more? Was he going soft, or was he only stale? Bond stood for a while watching the moon riding, careering, through the clouds. Then he shrugged his shoulders and went back to his desk. He decided that he was as fed up with the variations of violent physical behaviour as a psychoanalyst must become with the mental aberrations of his patients.

Bond read again the passage that had revolted him, “A drunken woman can also usually be handled by using the thumb and forefinger to grab the lower lip. By pinching hard and twisting, as the pull is made, the woman will come along.”

Bond grunted. The obscene delicacy of that “thumb and forefinger”！Bond lit a cigarette and stared into the filament of the desk light, switching his mind to other things, wishing that a signal would come in or the telephone ring. Another five hours to go before the nine o’clock report to the Chief of Staff or to M, if M happened to come in early. There was something nagging at his mind, something he had wanted to check on when he had the time. What was it? What had triggered off the reminder? Yes, that was it, “forefinger”—Goldfinger. He would see if Records had anything on the man.

Bond picked up the green telephone and dialled Records.

“Doesn’t ring a bell, sir. I’ll check and call you back.”

Bond put down the receiver.

It had been a wonderful trip up in the train. They had eaten the sandwiches and drunk the champagne and then, to the rhythm of the giant diesels pounding out the miles, they had made long, slow love in the narrow berth. It had been as if the girl was starved of physical love. She had woken him twice more in the night with soft demanding caresses, saying nothing, just reaching for his hard, lean body. The next day she had twice pulled down the roller blinds to shut out the hard light and had taken him by the hand and said, “Love me, James.”As if she was a child asking for a sweet.

Even now Bond could hear the quick silver poem of the level-crossing bells, the wail of the big windhorn out front and the quiet outside clamour at the stations when they lay and waited for the sensual gallop of the wheels to begin again.

Jill Masterton had said that Goldfinger had been relaxed, indifferent over his defeat. He had told the girl to tell Bond that he would be over in England in a week’s time and would like to have that game of golf at Sandwich. Nothing else—no threats, no curses. He had said he would expect the girl back by the next train. Jill had told Bond she would go. Bond had argued with her. But she was not frightened of Goldfinger. What could he do to her? And it was a good job.

Bond had decided to give her the ten thousand dollars Mr Du Pont had shuffled into his hand with a stammer of thanks and congratulations. Bond made her take the money. “I don’t want it,”Bond had said. “Wouldn’t know what to do with it. Anyway, keep it as mad money in case you want to get away in a hurry. It ought to be a million. I shall never forget last night and today.”

Bond had taken her to the station and had kissed her once hard on the lips and had gone away. It hadn’t been love, but a quotation had come into Bond’s mind as his cab moved out of Pennsylvania station, “Some love is fire, some love is rust. But the finest, cleanest love is lust.”Neither had had regrets. Had they committed a sin? If so, which one? A sin against chastity? Bond smiled to himself. There was a quotation for that too, and from a saint—Saint Augustine, “Oh Lord, give me Chastity. But don’t give it yet！”

The green telephone rang. “Three Goldfingers, sir, but two of them are dead. The third’s a Russian post office in Geneva. Got a hairdressing business. Slips the messages into the right-hand coat pocket when he brushes the customers down. He lost a leg at Stalingrad. Any good, sir? There’s plenty more on him.”

“No thanks. That couldn’t be my man.”

“We could put a trace through CID Records in the morning. Got a picture, sir?”

Bond remembered the Leica film. He hadn’t even bothered to have it developed. It would be quicker to mock up the man’s face on the Identicast. He said, “Is the Identicast room free?”

“Yes, sir. And I can operate it for you if you like.”

“Thanks. I’ll come down.”

Bond told the switchboard to let heads of sections know where he would be and went out and took the lift down to Records on the first floor.

The big building was extraordinarily quiet at night. Be neath the silence there was a soft whisper of machinery and hidden life—the muffled clack of a typewriter as Bond passed a door, a quickly suppressed stammer of radio static as he passed another, the soft background whine of the ventilation system. It gave you the impression of being in a battleship in harbour.

The Records duty officer was already at the controls of the Identicast in the projection room. He said to Bond, “Could you give me the main lines of the face, sir? That’ll help me leave out the slides that are obviously no good.”

Bond did so and sat back and watched the lighted screen.

The Identicast is a machine for building up an approximate picture of a suspect—or of someone who has perhaps only been glimpsed in a street or a train or in a passing car. It works on the magic lantern principle. The operator flashes on the screen various headshapes and sizes. When one is recognized it stays on the screen. Then various haircuts are shown, and then all the other features follow and are chosen one by one—different shapes of eyes, noses, chins, mouths, eyebrows, cheeks, ears. In the end there is the whole picture of a face, as near as the scanner can remember it, and it is photographed and put on record.

It took some time to put together Goldfinger’s extraordinary face, but the final result was an approximate likeness in monochrome. Bond dictated one or two notes about the sunburn, the colour of the hair and the expression of the eyes, and the job was done.

“Wouldn’t like to meet that on a dark night,”commented the man from Records. “I’ll put it through to CID when they come on duty. You should get the answer by lunch time.”Bond went back to the seventh floor. On the other side of the world it was around midnight. Eastern stations were closing down. There was a flurry of signals that had to be dealt with, the night’s log to be written up, and then it was eight o’clock. Bond telephoned the canteen for his breakfast. He had just finished it when there came the harsh purr of the red telephone. M！Why the hell had he got in half an hour early?

“Yes, sir.”

“Come up to my office, 007. I want to have a word before you go off duty.”

“Sir.”Bond put the telephone back. He slipped on his coat and ran a hand through his hair, told the switchboard where he would be, took the night log and went up in the lift to the eighth and top floor. Neither the desirable Miss Moneypenny nor the Chief of Staff was on duty. Bond knocked on M’s door and went in.

“Sit down, 007.”M was going through the pipe-lighting routine. He looked pink and well scrubbed. The lined sailor’s face above the stiff white collar and loosely tied spotted bow tie was damnably brisk and cheerful. Bond was conscious of the black stubble on his own chin and of the all-night look of his skin and clothes. He sharpened his mind.

“Quiet night?”M had got his pipe going. His hard, healthy eyes regarded Bond attentively.

“Pretty quiet, sir. Station H—”

M raised his left hand an inch or two. “Never mind. I’ll read all about it in the log. Here, I’ll take it.”

Bond handed over the Top Secret folder. M put it to one side. He smiled one of his rare, rather sardonic, bitten-off smiles. “Things change, 007. I’m taking you off night duty for the present.”

Bond’s answering smile was taut. He felt the quickening of the pulse he had so often experienced in this room. M had got something for him. He said, “I was just getting into it, sir.”

“Quite. Have plenty of opportunity later on. Something’s come up. Odd business. Not really your line of country, except for one particular angle which,”—M jerked his pipe sideways in a throwaway gesture—'may not be an angle at all.”

Bond sat back. He said nothing, waiting.

“Had dinner with the Governor of the Bank last night. One’s always hearing something new. At 'least, all this was new to me. Gold—the seamy side of the stuff. Smuggling, counterfeiting, all that. Hadn’t occurred to me that the Bank of England knew so much about crooks. Suppose it’s part of the Bank’s job to protect our currency.”M jerked his eyebrows up. “Know anything about gold?”

“No, sir.”

“Well, you will by this afternoon. You’ve got an appointment with a man called Colonel Smithers at the Bank at four o’clock. That give you enough time to get some sleep?”

“Yes, sir.”

“Good. Seems that this man Smithers is head of the Bank’s research department. From what the Governor told me, that’s nothing more or less than a spy system. First time I knew they had one. Just shows what watertight compartments we all work in. Anyway, Smithers and his chaps keep an eye out for anything fishy in the banking world—particularly any monkeying about with our currency and bullion reserves and what not. There was that business the other day of the Italians who were counterfeiting sovereigns. Making them out of real gold. Right carats and all that. But apparently a sovereign or a French napoleon is worth much more than its melted-down value in gold. Don’t ask me why. Smithers can tell you that if you’re interested. Anyway, the Bank went after these people with a whole battery of lawyers—it wasn’t technically a criminal offence—and, after losing in the Italian courts, they finally nailed them in Switzerland. You probably read about it. Then there was that business of dollar balances in Beirut. Made quite a stir in the papers. Couldn’t understand it myself. Some crack in the fence we put round our currency. The wide City boys had found it. Well, it’s Smithers’s job to smell out that kind of racket. The reason the Governor told me all this is because for years, almost since the war apparently, Smithers has had a bee in his bonnet about some big gold leak out of England. Mostly deduction, plus some kind of instinct. Smithers admits he’s got damned little to go on, but he’s impressed the Governor enough for him to get permission from the PM to call us in.”M broke off. He looked quizzically at Bond. “Ever wondered who are the richest men in England?”

“No, sir.”

“Well, have a guess. Or rather, put it like this：Who are the richest Englishmen?”

Bond searched his mind. There were a lot of men who sounded rich or who were made to sound rich by the newspapers. But who really had it, liquid, in the bank? He had to say something. He said hesitatingly, “Well, sir, there’s Sas—soon. Then that shipping man who keeps to himself—er—Ellerman. They say Lord Cowdray is very rich. There are the bankers—Rothschilds, Barings, Hambros. There was Williamson, the diamond man. Oppenheimer in South Africa. Some of the dukes may still have a lot of money.”Bond’s voice trailed away.

“Not bad. Not bad at all. But you’ve missed out the joker in the pack. Man I’d never thought of until the Governor brought up his name. He’s the richest of the lot. Man called Goldfinger. Auric Goldfinger.”Bond couldn’t help himself. He laughed sharply.

“What’s the matter?”M’s voice was testy. What the hell is there to laugh about?”

“I’m sorry, sir.”Bond got hold of himself. “The truth is, only last night I was building his face up on the Identicast.”He glanced at his watch. In a strangled voice he said, “Be on its way to CID Records. Asked for a Trace on him.”

M was getting angry. “What the hell’s all this about? Stop behaving like a bloody schoolboy.”

Bond said soberly, “Well, sir, it’s like this…”Bond told the story, leaving nothing out.

M’s face cleared. He listened with all his attention, leaning forward across the desk. When Bond had finished, M sat back in his chair. He said "Well, well… well' on a diminishing scale. He put his hands behind his head and gazed for minutes at the ceiling.

Bond could feel the laughter coming on again. How would the CID word the resounding snub he would get in the course of the day? He was brought sharply back to earth by M’s next words. “By the way, what happened to that ten thousand dollars?”

“Gave it to the girl, sir.”

“Really！Why not to the White Cross?”The White Cross Fund was for the families of Secret Service men and women who were killed on duty.

“Sorry, sir.”Bond was not prepared to argue that one.

“Humpf.”M had never approved of Bond’s womanizing. It was anathema to his Victorian soul. He decided to let it pass. He said, “Well, that’s all for now, 007. You’ll be hearing all about it this afternoon. Funny about Goldfinger. Odd chap. Seen him once or twice at Blades. He plays bridge there when he’s in England. He’s the chap the Bank of England’s after.”M paused. He looked mildly across the table at Bond. “As from this moment, so are you.”





CHAPTER SIX TALK OF GOLD


BOND WALKED up the steps and through the fine bronze portals and into the spacious, softly echoing entrance hall of the Bank of England and looked around him. Under his feet glittered the brilliant golden patterns of the Boris Anrep mosaics; beyond, through twenty-feet-high arched windows, green grass and geraniums blazed in the central courtyard. To right and left were spacious vistas of polished Hopton Wood stone. Over all hung the neutral smell of air-conditioned air and the heavy, grave atmosphere of immense riches.

One of the athletic-looking, pink frock-coated commissionaires came up to him. “Yes, sir?”

“Colonel Smithers?”

“Commander Bond, sir? This way please.”The commissionaire moved off to the right between the pillars. The bronze doors of a discreetly hidden lift stood open. The lift rose a few feet to the first floor. Now there was a long panelled corridor ending in a tall Adam window. The floor was close-carpeted in beige Wilton. The commissionaire knocked at the last of several finely carved oak doors that were just so much taller and more elegant than ordinary doors. A grey-haired woman was sitting at a desk. She looked as if she had once taken a double first. The walls of the room were lined with grey metal filing cabinets. The woman had been writing on a quarto pad of yellow memorandum paper. She smiled with a hint of conspiracy, picked up a telephone and dialled a number. “Commander Bond is here.”She put the telephone back and stood up. “Will you come this way?”She crossed the room to a door covered with green baize and held it open for Bond to go through.

Colonel Smithers had risen from his desk. He said gravely, “Nice of you to have come. Won’t you sit down?”Bond took the chair. “Smoke?”Colonel Smithers pushed forward a silver box of Senior Service and himself sat down and began to fill a pipe. Bond took a cigarette and lit it.

Colonel Smithers looked exactly like someone who would be called Colonel Smithers. He had obviously been a colonel, probably on the staff, and he had the smooth, polished, basically serious mien that fitted his name. But for his hornrimmed glasses, he might have been an efficient, not very well-fed courtier in a royal household.

Bond felt boredom gathering in the corners of the room. He said encouragingly, “It seems that you are to tell me all about gold.”

“So I understand. I had a note from the Governor. I gather I need keep nothing from you. Of course you understand,”Colonel Smithers looked over Bond’s right shoulder, “that most of what I shall have to say will be confidential.”The eyes swept quickly across Bond’s face.

Bond’s face was stony.

Colonel Smithers felt the silence that Bond had intended he should feel. He looked up, saw that he had put his foot in it, and tried to make amends. “Obviously I needn’t have mentioned the point. A man with your training…”

Bond said, “We all think our own secrets are the only ones that matter. You’re probably right to remind me. Other people’s secrets are never quite as important as one’s own. But you needn’t worry. I shall discuss things with my chief but with no one else.”

“Quite, quite. Nice of you to take it that way. In the Bank one gets into the habit of being over-discreet. Now then,”Colonel Smithers scurried for cover into his subject. “This business of gold. I take it it’s not a matter you’ve thought about a great deal?”

“I know it when I see it.”

“Aha, yes—well now, the great thing to remember about gold is that it’s the most valuable and most easily marketable commodity in the world. You can go to any town in the world, almost to any village, and hand over a piece of gold and get goods or services in exchange. Right?”Colonel Smithers’s voice had taken on a new briskness. His eyes were alight. He had his lecture pat. Bond sat back. He was prepared to listen to anyone who was master of his subject, any subject. “And the next thing to remember,”Colonel Smithers held up his pipe in warning, “is that gold is virtually untrace-able. Sovereigns have no serial numbers. If gold bars have Mint marks stamped on them the marks can be shaved off or the bar can be melted down and made into a new bar. That makes it almost impossible to check on the whereabouts of gold, or its origins, or its movements round the world. In England, for instance, we at the Bank can only count the gold in our own vaults,”in the vaults of other banks and at the Mint, and make a rough guess at the amounts held by the jewellery trade and the pawnbroking fraternity.”

“Why are you so anxious to know how much gold there is in England?”

“Because gold and currencies backed by gold are the foundation of our international credit. We can only tell what the true strength of the pound is, and other countries can only tell it, by knowing the amount of valuta we have behind our currency. And my main job, Mr Bond”—Colonel Smithers’s bland eyes had become unexpectedly sharp—“is to watch for any leakage of gold out of England—out of anywhere in the sterling area. And when I spot a leakage, an escape of gold towards some country where it can be exchanged more profitably than at our official buying price, it is my job to put the CID Gold Squad on to the fugitive gold and try to get it back into our vaults, plug the leak and arrest the people responsible. And the trouble is, Mr Bond”—Colonel Smithers gave a forlorn shrug of the shoulders—“that gold attracts the biggest, the most ingenious criminals. They are very hard, very hard indeed, to catch.”

“Isn’t all this only a temporary phase? Why should this shortage of gold go on? They seem to be digging it out of Africa fast enough. Isn’t there enough to go round? Isn’t it just like any other black market that disappears when the supplies are stepped up, like the penicillin traffic after the war?”

“I’m afraid not, Mr Bond. It isn’t quite as easy as that. The population of the world is increasing at the rate of five thousand four hundred every hour of the day. A small percentage of those people become gold hoarders, people who are frightened of currencies, who like to bury some sovereigns in the garden or under the bed. Another percentage needs gold fillings for their teeth. Others need gold-rimmed spectacles, jewellery, engagement rings. All these new people will be taking tons of gold off the market every year. New industries need gold wire, gold plating, amalgams of gold. Gold has extraordinary properties which are being put to new uses every day. It is brilliant, malleable, ductile, almost unalterable and more dense than any of the common metals except platinum. There’s no end to its uses. But it has two defects. It isn’t hard enough. It wears out quickly, leaves itself on the linings of our pockets and in the sweat of our skins. Every year, the world’s stock is invisibly reduced by friction. I said that gold has two defects.”Colonel Smithers looked sad. “The other and by far the major defect is that it is the talisman of fear. Fear, Mr Bond, takes gold out of circulation and hoards it against the evil day. In a period of history when every tomorrow may be the evil day, it is fair enough to say that a fat proportion of the gold that is dug out of one corner of the earth is at once buried again in another corner.”

Bond smiled at Colonel Smithers’s eloquence. This man lived gold, thought gold, dreamed gold. Well, it was an interesting subject. He might just as well wallow in the stuff. In the days when Bond had been after the diamond smugglers he had had first to educate himself in the fascination, the myth of the stones. He said, “What else ought I to know before we get down to your immediate problem?”

“You’re not bored? Well, you were suggesting that gold production was so vast nowadays that it ought to take care of all these various consumers. Unfortunately that is not so. In fact the gold content of the world is being worked out. You may think that large areas of the world have still to be explored for gold. You would be mistaken. Broadly speaking, there only remains the land under the sea and the sea itself, which has a notable gold content. People have been scratching the surface of the world for gold for thousands of years. There were the great gold treasures of Egypt and Mycenae, Montezuma and the Incas. Croesus and Midas emptied the Middle Eastern territories of gold. Europe was worked for it—the valleys of the Rhine and the Po, Malaga and the plains of Granada. Cyprus was emptied, and the Balkans. India got the fever. Ants coming up from under the earth carrying grains of gold led the Indians to their alluvial fields. The Romans worked Wales and Devon and Cornwall. In the Middle Ages there were the finds in Mexico and Peru. These were followed by the opening up of the Gold Coast, then called Negro-land, and after that came the Americas. The famous gold rushes of the Yukon and Eldorado, and the rich strikes at Eureka sounded off the first modern Gold Age. Meanwhile, in Australia, Bendigo and Ballarat had come into production, and the Russian deposits at Lena and in the Urals were making Russia the largest gold producer in the world in the middle of the nineteenth century. Then came the second modern Gold Age—the discoveries on the Wit-watersrand. These were helped by the new method of cyanid-ing instead of separation of the gold from the rock by mercury. Today we are in the third Gold Age with the opening up of the Orange Free State deposits.”Colonel Smithers threw up his hands. “Now, gold is pouring out of the earth. Why, the whole production of the Klondike and the Home-stake and Eldorado, which were once the wonder of the world, would only add up to two or three years of today’s production from Africa！Just to show you, from 1500 to 1900, when approximate figures were kept, the whole world produced about eighteen thousand tons of gold. From 1900 to today we have dug up forty-one thousand tons！At this rate, Mr Bond,”Colonel Smithers leaned forward earnestly, “and please don’t quote me—but I wouldn’t be surprised if in fifty years' time we have not totally exhausted the gold content of the earth！”

Bond, smothered by this cataract of gold history, found no difficulty in looking as grave as Colonel Smithers. He said, “You certainly make a fascinating story of it. Perhaps the position isn’t as bad as you think. They’re already mining oil under the sea. Perhaps they'll find a way of mining gold. Now, about this smuggling.”

The telephone rang. Colonel Smithers impatiently snatched up the receiver. “Smithers speaking.”He listened, irritation growing on his face. “I’m sure I sent you a note about the summer fixtures, Miss Philby. The next match is on Saturday against the Discount Houses.”He listened again. “Well, if Mrs Flake won’t play goals, I’m afraid she’ll have to stand down. It’s the only position on the field we’ve got for her. Everybody can’t play centre forward. Yes, please do. Say I’ll be greatly obliged if just this once. I’m sure she’ll be very good—right figure and all that. Thank you, Miss Philby.”

Colonel Smithers took out a handkerchief and mopped his forehead. “Sorry about that.Sports and welfare are becoming almost too much of a fetish at the Bank. I’ve just had the women’s hockey team thrown into my lap. As if I hadn’t got enough to do with the annual gymkhana coming on. How ever,”Colonel Smithers waved these minor irritations aside, “as you say, time to get on to the smuggling. Well, to begin with, and taking only England and the sterling area, it’s a very big business indeed. We employ three thousand staff at the Bank, Mr Bond, and of those no less than one thousand work in the exchange control department. Of those at least five hundred, including my little outfit, are engaged in controlling the illicit movements of valuta, the attempts to smuggle or to evade the Exchange Control Regulations.”

“That’s a lot.”Bond measured it against the Secret Service which had a total force of two thousand. “Can you give me an example of smuggling? In gold. I can’t understand these dollar swindles.”

“All right.”Colonel Smithers now talked in the soft, tired voice of an overworked man in the service of his Government. It was the voice of the specialist in a particular line of law enforcement. It said that he knew most things connected with that line and that he could make a good guess at all the rest. Bond knew the voice well, the voice of the first-class Civil Servant. Despite his prosiness, Bond was beginning to take to Colonel Smithers. “All right. Supposing you have a bar of gold in your pocket about the size of a couple of packets of Players. Weight about five and a quarter pounds. Never mind for the moment where you got it from—stole it or inherited it or something. That’ll be twenty-four carat-what we call a thousand fine. Now, the law says you have to sell that to the Bank of England at the controlled price of twelve pounds ten per ounce. That would make it worth around the thousand pounds. But you’re greedy. You’ve got a friend going to India or perhaps you’re on good terms with an airline pilot or a steward on the Far East run. All you have to do is cut your bar into thin sheets or plates—you’d soon find someone to do this for you—and sew the plates—they'd be smaller than playing cards—into a cotton belt, and pay your friend a commission to wear it. You could easily afford a hundred pounds for the job. Your friend flies off to Bombay and goes to the first bullion dealer in the bazaar. He will be given one thousand seven hundred pounds for your five-pound bar and you’re a richer man than you might have been. Mark you,”Colonel Smithers waved his pipe airily,”that’s only seventy per cent profit. Just after the war you could have got three hundred per cent. If you’d done only half a dozen little operations like that every year you’d be able to retire by now.”

“Why the high price in India?”Bond didn’t really want to know. He thought M might ask him.

“It’s a long story. Briefly, India is shorter of gold, particularly for her jewellery trade, than any other country.”

“What’s the size of this traffic?”

“Huge. To give an idea, the Indian Intelligence Bureau and their Customs captured fortythree thousand ounces in 1955.1 doubt if that’s one per cent of the traffic. Gold’s been coming into India from all points of the compass. Latest dodge is to fly it in from Macao and drop it by parachute to a reception committee—a ton at a time—like we used to drop supplies to the Resistance during the war.”

“I see. Is there anywhere else I can get a good premium for my gold bar?”

“You could get a small premium in most countries—Switzerland, for instance—but it wouldn’t be worth your while. India’s still the place.”

“All right,”said Bond. 1 think I’ve got the picture. Now what’s your particular problem?”He sat back and lit a cigarette. He was greatly looking forward to hearing about Mr Auric Goldfinger.

Colonel Smithers’s eyes took on their hard, foxy look. He said, “There’s a man who came over to England in 1937. He was a refugee from Riga. Name of Auric Goldfinger. He was only twenty when he arrived, but he must have been a bright lad because he smelled that the Russians would be swallowing his country pretty soon. He was a jeweller and goldsmith by trade, like his father and grandfather who had refined gold for Faberge. He had a little money and probably one of those belts of gold I was telling you about. Stole it from his father, I daresay. Well, soon after he’d been naturalized—he was a harmless sort of chap and in a useful trade and he had no difficulty in getting his papers—he started buying up small pawn-brokers all over the country. He put in his own men, paid them well and changed the name of the shops to "Goldfinger". Then he turned the shops over to selling cheap jewellery and buying old gold—you know the sort of place, “Best Prices for Old Gold. Nothing too Large, Nothing too Small,”and he had his own particular slogan, “Buy Her Engagement Ring With Grannie’s Locket.”Goldfinger did very well. Always chose good sites, just on the dividing line between the well-to-do streets and the lowermiddle. Never touched stolen goods and got a good name everywhere with the police. He lived in London and toured his, “shops once a month and collected all the old gold. He wasn’t interested in the jewellery side. He let his managers run that as they liked.”

Colonel Smithers looked quizzically at Bond. “You may think these lockets and gold crosses and things are pretty small beer. So they are, but they mount up if you’ve got twenty little shops, each one buying perhaps half a dozen bits and pieces every week. Well, the war came and Goldfinger, like all other jewellers, had to declare his stock of gold. I looked up his figure in our old records. It was fifty ounces for the whole chain！—just enough of a working stock to keep his shops supplied with ring setting and so forth, what they call jewellers' findings in the trade. Of course, he was allowed to keep it. He tucked himself away in a machine-tool firm in Wales during the war—well out of the firing line—but kept as many of his shops operating as he could. Must have done well out of the GIs who generally travel with a Gold Eagle or a Mexican fifty-dollar piece as a last reserve. Then, when peace broke out, Goldfinger got moving. He bought himself a house, pretentious sort of place, at Reculver, at the mouth of the Thames. He also invested in a wellfound Brixham trawler and an old Silver Ghost Rolls Royce—armoured car, built for some South American president who was killed before he could take delivery. He set up a little factory called “Thanet Alloy Research”in the grounds of his house and staffed it with a German metallurgist, a prisoner of war who didn’t want to go back to Germany, and half a dozen Korean stevedores he picked up in Liverpool. They didn’t know a word of any civilized language so they weren’t any security risk. Then, for ten years, all we know is that he made one trip a year to India in his trawler and a few trips in his car every year to Switzerland. Set up a subsidiary of his alloy company near Geneva. He kept his shops going. Gave up collecting the old gold himself—used one of his Koreans whom he had taught to drive a car. All right, perhaps Mr Goldfinger is not a very honest man, but he behaves himself and keeps in well with the police, and with much more blatant fiddling going on all over the country nobody paid him any attention.”Colonel Smithers broke off. He looked apologetically at Bond. “I’m not boring you? I do want you to get the picture of the sort of man this is—quiet, careful, law-abiding and with the sort of drive and single-mindedness we all admire. We didn’t even hear of him until he suffered a slight misfortune. In the summer of 1954, his trawler, homeward bound from India, went ashore on the Goodwins and he sold the wreck for a song to the Dover Salvage Company. When this company started breaking the ship up and got as far as the hold they found the timbers ingregnated with a sort of brown powder which they couldn’t put a name to. They sent a specimen to a local chemist. They were surprised when he said the stuff was gold. I won’t bother you with the formula, but you see gold can be made to dissolve in a mixture of hydrochloric and nitric acids, and reducing agents—sulphur dioxide or oxalic acid—precipitate the metal as a brown powder. This powder can be reconstituted into gold ingots by melting at around a thousand degrees Centigrade. Have to watch the chlorine gas, but otherwise it’s a simple process.

“The usual nosey parker in the salvage firm gossiped to one of the Dover Customs men and in due course a report filtered up through the police and the CID to me, together with a copy of the cargo clearance papers for each of Goldfinger’s trips to India. These gave all the cargoes as mineral dust base for crop fertilizers—all perfectly credible because these modern fertilizers do use traces of various minerals in their make-up. The whole picture was clear as crystal. Goldfinger had been refining down his old gold, precipitating it into this brown powder and shipping it to India as fertilizer. But could we pin it on him? We could not. Had a quiet look at his bank balance and tax returns. Twenty thousand pounds at Barclays in Ramsgate. Income tax and super tax paid promptly each year. Figures showed the natural progress of a well-run jewellery business. We dressed a couple of the Gold Squad up and sent them down to knock on the door of Mr Goldfinger’s factory at Reculver. ‘Sorry, sir, routine inspection for the Small Engineering Section of the Ministry of Labour. We have to make sure the Factory Acts are being observed for safety and health.’

“Come in. Come in.’ Mr Goldfinger positively welcomed them. Mark you, he may have been tipped off by his bank manager or someone, but that factory was entirely devoted to designing a cheap alloy for jewellers’ findings—trying out unusual metals like aluminium and tin instead of the usual copper and nickel and palladium that are used in gold alloys. There were traces of gold about, of course, and furnaces to heat up to two thousand degrees and so forth, but after all Goldfinger was a jeweller and a smelter in a small way, and all this was perfectly above-board. The Gold Squad retired discomfited, our legal department decided the brown dust in the trawler’s timbers was not enough to prosecute on without supporting evidence, and that was more or less that, except”—Colonel Smithers slowly wagged the stem of his pipe—“that I kept the file open and started sniffing around the banks of the world.”

Colonel Smithers paused. The rumble of the City came through the half-open window high up in the wall behind his chair. Bond glanced surreptitiously at his watch. Five o’clock. Colonel Smithers got up from his chair. He placed both hands palm downwards on the desk and leant forward. “It took me five years, Mr Bond, to find out that Mr Goldfinger, in ready money, is the richest man in England. In Zurich, in Nassau, in Panama, in New York, he has twenty million pounds’ worth of gold bars on safe deposit. And those bars, Mr Bond, are not Mint bars. They don’t carry any official marks of origin whatsoever. They’re bars that Mr Goldfinger has melted himself. I flew to Nassau and had a look at the five million pounds' worth or so he holds there in the vaults of the Royal Bank of Canada. Oddly enough, like all artists, he couldn’t refrain from signing his handiwork. It needs a microscope to see it, but somewhere, on each Goldfinger bar, a minute letter Z has been scratched in the metal. And that gold, or most of it, belongs to England. The Bank can do nothing about it, so we are asking you to bring Mr Goldfinger to book, Mr Bond, and get that gold back. You know about the currency crisis and the high bank rate? Of course. Well, England needs that gold, badly—and the quicker the better.”





CHAPTER SEVEN THOUGHTS IN A DB III


BOND FOLLOWED Colonel Smithers to the lift. While they waited for it, Bond glanced out of the tall window at the end of the passage. He was looking down into the deep well of the back courtyard of the Bank. A trim chocolate-brown lorry with no owner’s name had come into the courtyard through the triple steel gates. Square cardboard boxes were being unloaded from it and put on to a short conveyor belt that disappeared into the bowels of the Bank.

Colonel Smithers came over. “Fivers,”he commented. “Just come up from our printing works at Loughton.”

The lift came and they got in. Bond said, “I’m not very impressed by the new ones. They look like any other country’s money. The old ones were the most beautiful money in the world.”

They walked across the entrance hall, now dimly lit and deserted. Colonel Smithers said, “As a matter of fact I agree with you. Trouble was that those Reichsbank forgeries during the war were a darn sight too good. When the Russians captured Berlin, among the loot they got hold of the plates. We asked the Narodni Bank for them, but they refused to give them up. We and the Treasury decided it was just too dangerous. At any moment, if Moscow had been inclined, they could have started a major raid on our currency. We had to withdraw the old fivers. The new ones aren’t much to look at, but at least they'd be hell to forge.”

The night guard let them out on to the steps. Thread-needle Street was almost deserted. The long City night was beginning. Bond said goodbye to Colonel Smithers and walked along to the Tube. He had never thought very much about the Bank of England, but now that he had been inside the place he decided that the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street might be old but she still had some teeth left in her head.

Bond had been told to report back to M at six. He did so. M’s face was no longer pink and shining. The long day had knocked it about, stressed it, shrunken it. When Bond went in and took the chair across the desk, he noticed the conscious effort M made to clear his mind, cope with the new problem the day was to fling at him. M straightened himself in his chair and reached for his pipe. “Well?”

Bond knew the false belligerence of that particular bark. He told the gist of the story in less than five minutes.

When he had finished, M said thoughtfully, “Suppose we’ve got to take it on. Don’t understand a thing about the pound and bank rate and all that but everyone seems to be taking it damned seriously. Personally I should have thought the strength of the pound depended on how hard we all worked rather than how much gold we’d got. Germans didn’t have much gold after the war. Look where they've got in ten years. However, that’s probably too easy an answer for the politicians—or more likely too difficult. Got any ideas how to tackle this chap Goldfinger? Any way of getting closer to him, offering to do some dirty work for him or something like that?”

Bond said thoughtfully, “I wouldn’t get anywhere sucking up to him, asking him for a job or something of that sort, sir. I should say he’s the sort of man who only respects people who are tougher or smarter than he is. I’ve given him one beating and the only message I got from him was that he’d like me to play golf with him. Perhaps I’d better do just that.”

“Fine way for one of my top men to spend his time.”The sarcasm in Ad’s voice was weary, resigned. “All right. Go ahead. But if what you say is right, you’d better see that you beat him. What’s your cover story?”

Bond shrugged. “I hadn’t thought, sir. Perhaps I’d better be thinking of leaving Universal Export. No future in it. Having a holiday while I look round. Thinking of emigrating to Canada. Fed up here. Something like that. But perhaps I’d better play it the way the cards fall. I wouldn’t think he’s an easy man to fool.”

“All right. Report progress. And don’t think I’m not interested in this case.”M’s voice had changed. So had his expression. His eyes had become urgent, commanding. “Now I’ll give you one piece of information the Bank didn’t give you. It just happens that I also know what Mr Goldfinger’s gold bars look Like. As a matter of fact I was handling one today—scratched Z and all. It had come in with that haul we made last week when the Redland Resident Director’s office “caught fire”in Tangier. You’ll have seen the signals. Well, that’s the twentieth of these particular gold bars that have come our way since die war.”

Bond interrupted, “But that Tangier bar was out of the SMERSH safe.”

“Exactly. I’ve checked. All the other nineteen bars with the scratched Z have been taken from SMERSH operatives.”M paused. He said mildly, “Do you know, 007, I wouldn’t be at all surprised if Goldfinger doesn’t turn out to be the foreign banker, the treasurer so to speak, of SMERSH.”

James Bond flung the DBIII through the last mile of straight and did a racing change down into third and then into second for the short hill before the inevitable traffic crawl through Rochester. Leashed in by the velvet claw of the front discs, the engine muttered its protest with a mild back-popple from the twin exhausts. Bond went up into third again, beat the lights at the bottom of the hill and slid resignedly up to the back of the queue that would crawl on for a quarter of an hour—if he was lucky—through the sprawl of Rochester and Chatham.

Bond settled back into second and let the car idle. He reached for the wide gunmetal case of Morland cigarettes on the neighbouring bucket seat, fumbled for one and lit it from the dashboard.

He had chosen the A2 in preference to the A20 to Sandwich because he wanted to take a quick look at Goldfinger-land—Reculver and those melancholy forsaken reaches of the Thames which Goldfinger had chosen for his parish. He would then cross the Isle of Thanet to Ramsgate and leave his bag at the Channel Packet, have an early lunch and be off to Sandwich.

The car was from the pool. Bond had been offered the Aston Martin or a Jaguar 3.4. He had taken the DBIII. Either of the cars would have suited his cover—a well-to-do, rather adventurous young man with a taste for the good, the fast things of life. But the DB III had the advantage of an up-to-date triptyque, an inconspicuous colour—battleship grey—and certain extras which might or might not come in handy. These included switches to alter the type and colour of Bond’s front and rear lights if he was following or being followed at night, reinforced steel bumpers, fore and aft, in case he needed to ram, a longbarrelled Colt .45 in a trick compartment under the driver’s seat, a radio pick-up tuned to receive an apparatus called the Homer, and plenty of concealed space that would fox most Customs men.

Bond saw a chance and picked up fifty yards, sliding into a ten-yard gap left by a family saloon of slow reactions. The man at the wheel, who wore that infallible badge of the bad driver, a hat clamped firmly on the exact centre of his head, hooted angrily. Bond reached out of the window and raised an enigmatically clenched fist. The hooting stopped.

And now what about this theory of M’s? It made sense. The Russians were notoriously incompetent payers of their men. Their centres were always running out of funds—their men complaining to Moscow that they couldn’t afford a square meal. Perhaps SMERSH couldn’t get the valuta out of the Ministry of Home Security. Or perhaps the Ministry of Home Security couldn’t get the money out of the Ministry of Finance. But it had always been the same—endless money troubles that resulted in missed chances, broken promises and waste of dangerous radio time. It would make sense to have a clever financial brain somewhere outside Russia who could not only transmit funds to the centres but also, in this case, make profits large enough to run the SMERSH centres abroad without any financial assistance from Moscow. Not only that. On the side, Goldfinger was appreciably damaging the currency base of an enemy country. If all this was correct, it was typical of SMERSH—a brilliant scheme, faultlessly operated by an outstanding man. And that, reflected Bond as he roared up the hill into Chatham, putting half a dozen cars behind him, would partly explain Goldfinger’s greed for more and still more money. Devotion to the cause, to SMERSH, and perhaps the dangled prize of an Order of Lenin, would be the spur to pick up even ten or twenty thousand dollars when the odds were right or could be favourably adjusted. The funds for Red Revolution, for the discipline by fear that was the particular speciality of SMERSH, could never be big enough. Goldfinger was not making the money for himself. He was making it for the conquest of the world！The minor risk of being found out, as he had been by Bond, was nothing. Why? What could the Bank of England get him if every single one of his past operations could be exposed? Two years? Three?

The traffic was thinning through the outskirts of Gilling-ham. Bond started motoring again, but easily now, not hurrying, following his thoughts as the hands and feet went through their automatic responses.

So, in‘thirty-seven, SMERSH must have sent Goldfinger out With the belt of gold round his young waist. He had shown his special aptitudes, his acquisitive bent, during his training in the spy school in Leningrad. He would have been told there would be a war, that he must dig himself in and start quietly accumulating. Goldfinger must never dirty his hands, never meet an agent, never receive or pass a message. Some routine would have been arranged. “Second-hand ‘39 Vauxhall. First offer of £1000 secures”, “Immaculate Rover, £2000”, “Bentley, £5000”. Always an advertisement that would not attract attention or correspondence. The prices would be just too high, the description inadequate. In the Agony column of The Times, perhaps. And, obediently, Goldfinger would leave the two thousand pounds or the five thousand pounds gold bar at one of a long, a very long series of post-boxes that had been arranged in Moscow before he left. A particular bridge, a hollow tree, under a rock in a stream somewhere, anywhere in England. And he would never, on any account, visit that postbox again. It was up to Moscow to see that the agent got to the hidden treasure. Later, after the war, when Goldfinger was blossoming out, when he had become a big man, the postboxes would no longer be bridges and trees. Now he would be given dates and safety deposit box numbers, left-luggage lockers at stations. But still there would be the rule that Goldfinger must never revisit the scene, never endanger himself. Perhaps he would only get his instructions once a year, at a casual meeting in some park, in a letter slipped into his pocket on a train journey. But always it would be bars of gold, anonymous, untraceable if captured—except for the tiny Z that his vanity had scratched on his handiwork and that a dull dog at the Bank of England called Colonel Smithers had happened upon in the course of his duties.

Now Bond was running through the endless orchards of the Faversham growers. The sun had come out from behind, the smog of London. There was the distant gleam of the Thames on his left. There was traffic on the river—long, glistening tankers, stubby merchantmen, antediluvian Dutch Schuyts. Bond left the Canterbury road and switched on to the incongruously rich highway that runs through the cheap bungaloid world of the holiday lands—Whitstable, Herne Bay, Birchington, Margate. He still idled along at fifty, holding the racing wheel on a light rein, listening to the relaxed purr of the exhausts, fitting the bits of his thoughts into the jigsaw as he had done two nights before with Goldfinger’s face on the Identicast.

And, Bond reflected, while Goldfinger was pumping a million, two million pounds a year into the bloody maw of SMERSH, he was pyramiding his reserves, working on them, making them work for him whenever the odds were right, piling up the surplus for the day when the trumpets would sound in the Kremlin and every golden sinew would be mobilized. And no one outside Moscow had been watching the process, no one suspected that Goldfinger—the jeweller, the metallurgist, the resident of Reculver and Nassau, the respected member of Blades, of the Royal St Marks at Sandwich—was one of the greatest conspirators of all time, that he had financed the murder of hundreds, perhaps thousands of victims of SMERSH all over the world. SMERSH, Smiert Spionam, Death to Spies—the murder Apparat of the High Praesidium！And only M suspected it, only Bond knew it. And here was Bond, launched against this man by a series of flukes, a train of coincidence that had been started by a plane breaking down on the other side of the world. Bond smiled grimly to himself. How often in his profession had it been the same—the tiny acorn of coincidence that soared into the mighty oak whose branches darkened the sky. And now, once again, he was setting out to bring the dreadful growth down. With what? A bag of golf clubs?

A repainted sky-blue Ford Popular with large yellow ears was scurrying along the crown of the road ahead. Mechanically Bond gave the horn ring a couple of short, polite jabs. There was no reaction. The Ford Popular was doing its forty. Why should anyone want to go more than that respectable speed? The Ford obstinately hunched its shoulders and kept on its course. Bond gave it a sharp blast, expecting it to swerve. He had to touch his brakes when it didn’t. Damn the man！Of course！The usual tense figure, hands held too high up on the wheel, and the inevitable hat, this time a particularly hideous black bowler, square on a large bullet head. Oh well, thought Bond, they weren’t his stomach ulcers. He changed down and contemptuously slammed the DB III past on the inside. Silly bastard！

Another five miles and Bond was through the dainty tele-world of Herne Bay. The howl of Mansion sounded away on his right. A flight of three Super Sabres came in to land. They skimmed below his right-Hand horizon as if they were diving into the earth. With half his mind, Bond heard the roar of their jets catch up with them as they landed and taxied in to the hangars. He came up with a crossroads. To the left the signpost said RECULVER. Underneath was the ancient monument sign for Reculver church. Bond slowed, but didn’t stop. No hanging about. He motored slowly on, keeping his eyes open. The shoreline was too exposed for a trawler to do anything but beach or anchor. Probably Goldfinger had used Ramsgate. Quiet little port. Customs and police who were probably only on the look-out for brandy coming over from France. There was a thick clump of trees between the road and the shore, a glimpse of roofs and of a medium-sized factory chimney with a thin plume of light smoke or steam. That would be it. Soon there was the gate of a long drive. A discreetly authoritative sign said THANET ALLOYS, and underneath：NO ADMITTANCE EXCEPT ON BUSINESS. All very respectable. Bond drove slowly on. There was nothing more to be seen. He took the next right-hand turn across the Manston plateau to Ramsgate.

It was twelve o’clock. Bond inspected his room, a double with bathroom, on the top floor of the Channel Packet, unpacked his few belongings and went down to the snack bar where he had one vodka and tonic and two rounds of excellent ham sandwiches with plenty of mustard. Then he got back into his car and drove slowly over to the Royal St Marks at Sandwich.

Bond carried his clubs to the professional’s shop and through to the workroom. Alfred Blacking was winding a new grip on to a driver.

“Hullo, Alfred.”

The professional looked up sharply. His sunburned, leathery face broke into a wide smile. “Why, if it isn’t Mr James！”They shook hands. “Must be fifteen, twenty years. What brings you down here, sir? Someone was telling me only the other day that you’re in the diplomatic or something. Always abroad. Well, I never！Still the same flat swing, sir?”Alfred Blacking joined his hands and gave a low, flat sweep.

“Afraid so, Alfred. Never had time to get myself out of it. How’s Mrs Blacking and Cecil?”

“Can’t complain, sir. Cecil was runner-up in the Kent Championship last year. Should win it this year if he can only get out of the shop and on to the course a bit more.”

Bond propped his clubs up against the wall. It was good to be back. Everything was just the same. There had been a time in his teens when he had played two rounds a day every day of the week at St Marks. Blacking had always wanted to take him in hand. “A bit of practice, Mr James, and you’d be scratch. No fooling. You really would. What do you want to hang around at six for? It’s all there except for that flat swing and wanting to hit the ball out of sight when there’s no point in it. And you’ve got the temperament. A couple of years, perhaps only one, and I’d have you in the Amateur.”But something had told Bond that there wasn’t going to be a great deal of golf in his life and if he liked the game he’d better forget about lessons and just play as much of it as he could. Yes, it would be about twenty years since he had played his last round on St Marks. He’d never been back—even when there had been that bloody affair of the Moon-raker at Kingsdown, ten miles down the coast. Perhaps it had been sentimentality. Since St Marks, Bond had got in a good deal of weekend golf when he was at headquarters. But always on the courses round London—Huntercombe, Swinley, Sunningdale, the Berkshire. Bond’s handicap had gone up to nine. But he was a real nine—had to be with the games he chose to play, the tenpound Nassaus with the tough cheery men who were always so anxious to stand you a couple of double kümmels after lunch.

“Any chance of a game, Alfred?”

The professional glanced through his back window at the parking space round the tall flag-pole. He shook his head. “Doesn’t look too good, sir. Don’t get many players in the middle of the week at this time of year.”

“What about you?”

“Sorry, sir. I’m booked. Playing with a member. It’s a regular thing. Every day at two o’clock. And the trouble is that Cecil’s gone over to Princes to get in some practice for the championship. What a dashed nuisance！”(Alfred never used a stronger oath.) “It would happen like that. How long are you staying, sir?”

“Not long. Never mind. I’ll knock a ball round with a caddie. Who’s this chap you’re playing with?”

“A Mr Goldfinger, sir.”Alfred looked discouraging.

“Oh, Goldfinger. I know the chap. Met him the other day in America.”

“You did, sir?”Alfred obviously found it difficult to believe that anyone knew Mr Goldfinger. He watched Bond’s face carefully for any further reaction.

“Any good?”

“So-so, sir. Pretty useful off nine.”

“Must take his game damned seriously if he plays with you every day.”

“Well, yes, sir.”The professional’s face had the expression Bond remembered so well. It meant that Blacking had an unfavourable view of a particular member but that he was too good a servant of the club to pass it on.

Bond smiled. He said, “You haven’t changed, Alfred. What you mean is that no one else will play with him. Remember Farquharson? Slowest player in England. I remember you going round and round with him twenty years ago. Come on. What’s the matter with Goldfinger?”The professional laughed. He said, “It’s you that hasn’t changed, Mr James. You always were dashed inquisitive.”He came a step closer and lowered his voice. “The truth is, sir, some members think Mr Goldfinger is just a little bit hot. You know, sir. Improves his lie and so forth.”The professional took the driver he was holding, took up a stance, gazed towards an imaginary hole and banged the head of the club up and down on the floor as if addressing an imaginary ball. “Let me see now, is this a brassie lie? What d'you think caddie?”Alfred Blacking chuckled. “Well, of course, by the time he’s finished hammering the ground behind the ball, the ball’s been raised an inch and it is a brassie lie.”Alfred Blacking’s face closed up again. He said non-committally, “But that’s only gossip, sir. I’ve never seen anything. Quiet-spoken gentleman. He’s got a place at Reculver. Used to come here a lot. But for the last few years he’s only been coming to England for a few weeks at a time. Rings up and asks if anyone’s wanting a game and when there isn’t anyone he books Cecil or me. Rang up this morning and asked if there was anyone about. There’s sometimes a stranger drops in.”Alfred Blacking looked quizzically at Bond. “I suppose you wouldn’t care to take him on this afternoon? It’ll look odd you being here and short of a game. And you knowing him and all. He might think I’d been trying to keep him to myself or something. That wouldn’t do.”

“Nonsense, Alfred. And you’ve got your living to make. Why don’t we play a three-ball?”

“He won’t play them, sir. Says they’re too slow. And I agree with him. And don’t you worry about my fee. There’s a lot of work to do in the shop and 1’ll be glad of an afternoon to get down to it.”Alfred Blacking glanced at his watch. “He’ll be along any minute now. I’ve got a caddie for you. Remember Hawker?”Alfred Blacking laughed indulgently. “Still the same old Hawker. He’ll be another that’ll be glad to see you down here again.”Bond said, “Well thanks, Alfred. I’d be interested to see how this chap plays. But why not leave it like this? Say I’ve dropped in to get a dub made up. Old member. Used to play here before the war. And I need a new number four wood anyway. Your old one has started to give at the seams a bit. Just be casual. Don’t say you’ve told me he’s about. I’ll stay in the shop so it’ll give him a chance to take his choice without offending me.Perhaps he won’t like my face or something. Right?”

“Very good, Mr James. Leave it to me. That’s his car coming now, sir.”Blacking pointed through the window. Half a mile away, a bright yellow car was turning off the road and coming up the private drive. “Funny looking contraption. Sort of motor car we used to see here when I was a boy.”

Bond watched the old Silver Ghost sweep majestically up the drive towards the club. She was a beauty！The sun glittered off the silver radiator and off the engine-turned aluminium shield below the high perpendicular glass cliff of the windscreen. The luggage rail on the roof of the heavy coach-built limousine body—so ugly twenty years ago, so strangely beautiful today—was polished brass, as were the two Lucas “King of the Road”headlamps that stared so haughtily down the road ahead, and the wide mouth of the old boa-constrictor bulb horn. The whole car, except for a black roof and black carrosserie lines and curved panels below the windows, was primrose yellow. It crossed Bond’s mind that the South American president might have had it copied from the famous yellow fleet in which Lord Lonsdale had driven to the Derby and Ascot.

And now? In the driver’s seat sat a figure in a cafe-au-lait dust coat and cap, his big round face obscured by black-rimmed driving goggles. Beside him was a squat figure in black with a bowler hat placed firmly on the middle of his head. The two figures stared straight in front of them with a curious immobility. It was almost as if they were driving a hearse.

The car was coming closer. The six pairs of eyes—the eyes of the two men and the great twin orbs of the car—seemed to be looking straight through the little window and into Bond’s eyes.

Instinctively, Bond took a few paces back into the dark recesses of the workroom. He noticed the movement and smiled to himself. He picked up somebody’s putter and bent down and thoughtfully addressed a knot in the wooden floor.





CHAPTER EIGHT ALL TO PLAY FOR


“GOOD AFTERNOON, Blacking. All set?”The voice was casual, authoritative. “I see there’s a car outside. Not somebody looking for a game, I suppose?”

“I’m not sure, sir. It’s an old member come back to have a club made up. Would you like me to ask him, sir?”

“Who is it? What’s his name?”Bond smiled grimly. He pricked his ears. He wanted to catch every inflection.

“A Mr Bond, sir.”

There was a pause. “Bond?”The voice had not changed. It was politely interested. “Met a fellow called Bond the other day. What’s his first name?”

“James, sir.”

“Oh yes.”Now the pause was longer. “Does he know I’m here?”Bond could sense Goldfinger’s antennae probing the situation.

“He’s in the workshop, sir. May have seen your car drive up.”Bond thought：Alfred’s never told a lie in his life. He’s not going to start now.

“Might be an idea.”Now Goldfinger’s voice unbent. He wanted something from Alfred Blacking, some information. “What sort of a game does this chap play? What’s his handicap?”

“Used to be quite useful when he was a boy, sir. Haven’t seen his game since then.”

“Hm.”

Bond could feel the man weighing it all up. Bond smelled that the bait was going to be taken. He reached into his bag and pulled out his driver and started rubbing down the grip with a block of shellac. Might as well look busy. A board in the shop creaked. Bond honed away industriously, his back to the open door.

“I think we’ve met before.”The voice from the doorway was low, neutral.

Bond looked quickly over his shoulder. “My God, you made me jump. Why”—recognition dawned—“it’s Gold, Goldman… er—Goldfinger.”He hoped he wasn’t overplaying it. He said with a hint of dislike, or mistrust, “Where have you sprung from?”

“I told you I played down here. Remember?”Goldfinger was looking at him shrewdly.

Now the eyes opened wide. The X-ray gaze pierced through to the back of Bond’s skull.

“No.”

“Did not Miss Masterton give you my message?”

“No. What was it?”

“I said I would be over here and that I would like a game of golf with you.”

“Oh, well,”Bond’s voice was coldly polite, “we must do that some day.”

“I was playing with the professional. I will play with you instead.”Goldfinger was stating a fact.

There was no doubt that Goldfinger was hooked. Now Bond must play hard to get.

“Why not some other time? I’ve come to order a club. Anyway I’m not in practice. There probably isn’t a caddie.”Bond was being as rude as he could. Obviously the last thing he wanted to do was play with Goldfinger.

“I also haven’t played for some time.”(Bloody liar, thought Bond.) “Ordering a club will not take a moment.”Goldfinger turned back into the shop. “Blacking, have you got a caddie for Mr Bond?”

“Yes, sir.”

“Then that is arranged.”

Bond wearily thrust his driver back into his bag. “Well, all right then.”He thought of a final way of putting Goldfinger off. He said roughly, “But I warn you I like playing for money. I can’t be bothered to knock a ball round just for the fun of it.”Bond felt pleased with the character he was building up for himself.

Was there a glint of triumph, quickly concealed, in Goldfinger’s pale eyes? He said indifferently, “That suits me. Anything you like. Off handicap, of course. I think you said you’re nine.”

“Yes.”Goldfinger said carefully, “Where, may I ask?”

“Huntercombe.”Bond was also nine at Sunningdale. Huntercombe was an easier course. Nine at Huntercombe wouldn’t frighten Goldfinger.

“And I also am nine. Here. Up on the board. So it’s a level game. Right?”

Bond shrugged. “You’ll be too good for me.”

“I doubt it. However,”Goldfinger was offhand,”tell you what I’ll do. That bit of money you removed from me in Miami. Remember? The big figure was ten. I like a gamble. It will be good for me to have to try. I will play you double or quits for that.”Bond said indifferently, “That’s too much.”Then, as if he thought better of it, thought he might win, he said—with just the right amount of craft mixed with reluctance—“Of course you can say that was ‘found money’. I won’t miss it if it goes again. Oh, well, all right.Easy come easy go. Level match. Ten thousand dollars it is.”

Goldfinger turned away. He said, and there was a sudden sweetness in the flat voice, “That’s all arranged then, Mr Blacking. Many thanks. Put your fee down on my account.Very sorry we shall be missing our game. Now, let me pay the caddie fees.”

Alfred Blacking came into the workroom and picked up Bond’s clubs. He looked very directly at Bond. He said, “Remember what I told you, sir.”One eye closed and opened again. “I mean about that flat swing of yours. It needs watching—all the time.”Bond smiled at him. Alfred had long ears. He might not have caught the figure, but he knew that somehow this was to be a key game. “Thanks, Alfred. I won’t forget. Four Penfolds—with hearts on them. And a dozen tees. I won’t be a minute.”

Bond walked through the shop and out to his car. The bowler-hatted man was polishing the metal work of the Rolls with a cloth. Bond felt rather than saw him stop and watch Bond take out his zip bag and go into the club house. The man had a square flat yellow face. One of the Koreans?

Bond paid his green-fee to Hampton, the steward, and went into the changing-room. It was just the same—the same tacky smell of old shoes and socks and last summer’s sweat. Why was it a tradition of the most famous golf clubs that their standard of hygiene should be that of a Victorian private school? Bond changed his socks and put on the battered old pair of nailed Saxones. He took off the coat of his yellowing black and white hound’s tooth suit and pulled on a faded black wind-cheater. Cigarettes? Lighter? He was ready to go.

Bond walked slowly out, preparing his mind for the game. On purpose he had needled this man into a high, tough match so that Goldfinger’s respect for him should be increased and Goldfinger’s view of Bond—that he was the type of ruthless, hard adventurer who might be very useful to Goldfinger—would be confirmed. Bond had thought that perhaps a hundred-pound Nassau would be the form. But ten thousand dollars！There had probably never been such a high singles game in history—except in the finals of American Championships or in the big amateur Calcutta Sweeps where it was the backers rather than the players who had the money on. Goldfinger’s private accounting must have taken a nasty dent. He wouldn’t have liked that. He would be aching to get some of his money back. When Bond had talked about playing high, Goldfinger had seen his chance. So be it. But one thing was certain, for a hundred reasons Bond could not afford to lose.

He turned into the shop and picked up the balls and tees from Alfred Blacking.

“Hawker’s got the clubs, sir.”

Bond strolled out across the five hundred yards of shaven seaside turf that led to the first tee. Goldfinger was practising on the putting green. His caddie stood near by, rolling balk to him. Goldfinger putted in the new fashion—between his legs with a mallet putter. Bond felt encouraged. He didn’t believe in the system. He knew it was no good practising himself. His old hickory Calamity Jane had its good days and its bad. There was nothing to do about it. He knew also that the St Marks practice green bore no resemblance, in speed or texture, to the greens on the course.

Bond caught up with the limping, insouciant figure of his caddie who was sauntering along chipping at an imaginary ball with Bond’s blaster. “Afternoon, Hawker.”

“Afternoon, sir.”Hawker handed Bond the blaster and threw down three used balls. His keen sardonic poacher’s face split in a wry grin of welcome. “HowVe you been keep in', sir? Played any golf in the last twenty years? Can you still put them on the roof of the starter’s hut?”This referred to the day when Bond, trying to do just that before a match, had put two balls through the starter’s window.

“Let’s see.”Bond took the blaster and hefted it in his hand, gauging the distance. The tap of the balls on the practice green had ceased. Bond addressed the ball, swung quickly, lifted his head and shanked the ball almost at right angles. He tried again. This time it was a dunch. A foot of turf flew up. The ball went ten yards. Bond turned to Hawker, who was looking his most sardonic. “It’s all right, Hawker. Those were for show. Now then, one for you.”He stepped up to the third ball, took his club back slowly and whipped the club head through. The ball soared a hundred feet, paused elegantly, dropped eighty feet on to the thatched roof of the starter’s hut and bounced down.

Bond handed back the club. Hawker’s eyes were thoughtful, amused. He said nothing.

He pulled out the driver and handed it to Bond. They walked together to the first tee, talking about Hawker’s family.

Goldfinger joined them, relaxed, impassive. Bond greeted Goldfinger’s caddie, an obsequious, talkative man called Foulks whom Bond had never liked. Bond glanced at Goldfinger’s clubs. They were a brand new set of American Ben Hogans with smart St Marks leather covers for the woods. The bag was one of the stitched black leather holdalls favoured by American pros. The clubs were in individual cardboard tubes for easy extraction. It was a pretentious outfit, but the best.

“Toss for honour?”Goldfinger flicked a coin.

“Tails.”

It was heads. Goldfinger took out his driver and unpeeled a new ball. He said, “Dunlop 65. Number One. Always use the same ball. What’s yours?”

“Tenfold. Hearts.”Goldfinger looked keenly at Bond. “Strict Rules of Golf?”

“Naturally.”

“Right.”Goldfinger walked on to the tee and teed up. He took one or two careful, concentrated practice swings. It was a type of swing Bond knew well—the grooved, mechanical, repeating swing of someone who'had studied the game with great care, read all the books and spent five thousand pounds on the finest pro teachers. It would be a good, scoring swing which might not collapse under pressure. Bond envied it.

Goldfinger took up his stance, wagged gracefully, took his club head back in a wide slow arc and, with his eyes glued to the ball, broke his wrists correctly. He brought the club head mechanically, effortlessly, down and through the ball and into a rather artificial, copybook finish. The ball went straight and true about two hundred yards down the fairway.

It was an excellent, uninspiring shot. Bond knew that Goldfinger would be capable of repeating the same swing with different clubs again and again round the eighteen holes.

Bond took his place, gave himself a lowish tee, addressed the ball with careful enmity and, with a flat, racket-player’s swing in which there was just too much wrist for safety, lashed the ball away. It was a fine, attacking drive that landed past Goldfinger’s ball and rolled on fifty yards. But it had had a shade of draw and ended on the edge of the lefthand rough.

They were two good drives. As Bond handed his club to Hawker and strolled off in the wake of the more impatient Goldfinger, he smelled the sweet smell of the beginning of a knock-down-and-drag-out game of golf on a beautiful day in May with the larks singingover the greatest seaside course in the world.

The first hole of the Royal St Marks is four hundred and fifty yards long—four hundred and fifty yards of undulating fairway with one central bunker to trap a mis-hit second shot and a chain of bunkers guarding three-quarters of the green to trap a well-hit one. You can slip through the unguarded quarter, but the fairway slopes to the right there and you are more likely to end up with a nasty first-chip-of-the-day out of the rough. Goldfinger was well placed to try for this opening. Bond watched him take what was probably a spoon, make his two practice swings and address the ball.

Many unlikely people play golf, including people who are blind, who have only one arm, or even no legs, and people often wear bizarre clothes to the game. Other golfers don’t think them odd, for there are no rules of appearance or dress at golf. That is one of its minor pleasures. But Goldfinger had made an attempt to look smart at golf and that is the only way of dressing that is incongruous on a links. Everything matched in a blaze of rust-coloured tweed from the buttoned “golfer’s cap”centred on the huge, flaming red hair, to the brilliantly polished, almost orange shoes. The plus-four suit was too well cut and the plus-fours themselves had been pressed down the sides. The stockings were of a matching heather mixture and had green garter tabs. It was as if Goldfinger had gone to his tailor and said, “Dress me for golf—you know, like they wear in Scotland.”Social errors made no impression on Bond, and for the matter of that he rarely noticed them. With Goldfinger it was different. Everything about the man had grated on Bond’s teeth from the first moment he had seen him. The assertive blatancy of his clothes was just part of the malevolent animal magnetism that had affected Bond from the beginning.

Goldfinger executed his mechanical, faultless swing. The ball flew true but just failed to make the slope and curled off to the right to finish pinhigh off the green in the short rough. Easy five. A good chip could turn it into a four, but it would have to be a good one.

Bond walked over to his ball. It was lying cocked up, just off the fairway. Bond took his number four wood. Now for the “all air route”—a soaring shot that would carry the crossbunkers and give him two putts for a four. Bond remembered the dictum of the pros：“It’s never too early to start winning.”He took it easy, determined not to press for the long but comfortable carry.

As soon as Bond had hit the shot he knew it wouldn’t do. The difference between a good golf shot and a bad one is the same as the difference between a beautiful and a plain woman—a matter of millimetres. In this case, the club face had gone through just that one millimetre too low under the ball. The arc of flight was high and soft—no legs. Why the hell hadn’t he taken a spoon or a two iron off that lie? The ball hit the lip of the far bunker and fell back. Now it was the blaster, and fighting for a half.

Bond never worried too long about his bad or stupid shots. He put them behind him and thought of the next. He came up with the bunker, took his blaster and measured the distance to the pin. Twenty yards. The ball was lying well back. Should he splash it out with a wide stance and an outside-in swing, or should he blast it and take plenty of sand?

For safety’s sake he would blast it out. Bond went down into the bunker. Head down and follow well through. The easiest shot in golf. Try and put it dead. The wish, half way down his bade swing, hurried the hands in front of the club head. The loft was killed and there was the ball rolling back off the face. Get it out, you bloody fool, and hole a long putt！Now Bond took too much sand. He was out, but barely on the green. Goldfinger bent to his chip and kept his head down until the ball was half way to the hole. The ball stopped three inches from the pin. Without waiting to be given the putt, Goldfinger turned his back on Bond and walked off towards the second tee. Bond picked up his ball and took his driver from Hawker.

“What does he say his handicap is, sir?”

“Nine. It’s a level match. Have to do better than that though. Ought to have taken my spoon for the second.”

Hawker said encouragingly, “It’s early days yet, sir.”

Bond knew it wasn’t. It was always too early to start losing.





PART TWO：COINCIDENCE





CHAPTER NINE THE CUP AND THE LIP


GOLDFINGER HAD already teed up. Bond walked slowly behind him, followed by Hawker. Bond stood and leant on his driver. He said, “I thought you said we would be playing the strict rules of golf. But I’ll give you that putt. That makes you one up.”

Goldfinger nodded curtly. He went through his practice routine and hit his usual excellent, safe drive.

The second hole is a three hundred and seventy yard dogleg to the left with deep crossbunkers daring you to take the tiger’s line. But there was a light helping breeze. For Goldfinger it would now be a five iron for his second. Bond decided to try and make it easier for himself and only have a wedge for. the green. He laid his ears back and hit the ball hard and straight for the bunkers. The breeze got under the slight draw and winged the ball on and over. The ball pitched and disappeared down into the gully just short of the green. A four. Chance of a three.

Goldfinger strode off without comment. Bond lengthened his stride and caught up.

“How’s the agoraphobia? Doesn’t all this wide open space bother it?”

“No.”

Goldfinger deviated to the right. He glanced at the distant, half-hidden flag, planning his second shot. He took his five iron and hit a good, careful shot which took a bad kick short of the green and ran down into the thick grass to the left. Bond knew that territory. Goldfinger would be lucky to get down in two.

Bond walked up to his ball, took the wedge and flicked the ball on to the green with plenty of stop. The ball pulled up and lay a yard past the hole. Goldfinger executed a creditable pitch but missed the twelve-foot putt. Bond had two for the hole from a yard. He didn’t wait to be given the hole but walked up and putted. The ball stopped an inch short. Goldfinger walked off the green. Bond knocked the ball in. All square.

The third is a blind two hundred and forty yards, all carry, a difficult three. Bond chose his brassie and hit a good one. It would be on or near the green. Goldfinger’s routine drive was well hit but would probably not have enough steam to carry the last of the rough and trickle down into the saucer of the green. Sure enough, Goldfinger’s ball was on top of the protecting mound of rough. He had a nasty, cuppy lie, with a tuft just behind the ball. Goldfinger stood and looked at the lie. He seemed to make up his mind. He stepped past his ball to take a club from the caddie. His left foot came down just behind the ball, flattening the tuft. Goldfinger could now take his putter. He did so and trickled the ball down the bank towards the hole. It stopped three feet short.

Bond frowned. The only remedy against a cheat at golf is not to play with him again. But that was no good in this match. Bond had no intention of playing with the man again. And it was no good starting a you-did-I-didn’t argument unless he caught Goldfinger doing something even more outrageous. Bond would just have to try and beat him, cheating and all.

Now Bond’s twenty-foot putt was no joke. There was no question of going for the hole. He would have to concentrate on laying it dead. As usual, when one plays to go dead, the ball stopped short—a good yard short. Bond took a lot of trouble about the putt and holed it, sweating. He knocked Goldfinger’s ball away. He would go on giving Goldfinger missable putts until suddenly Bond would ask him to hole one. Then that one might look just a bit more difficult.

Still all square. The fourth is four hundred and sixty yards. You drive over one of the tallest and deepest bunkers in the United Kingdom and then have a long second shot across an undulating hilly fairway to a plateau green guarded by a final slope which makes it easier to take three putts than two.

Bond picked up his usual fifty yards on the drive and Goldfinger hit two of his respectable shots to the gully below the green. Bond, determined to get up, took a brassie instead of a spoon and went over the green and almost up against the boundary fence. From there he was glad to get down in three for a half.

The fifth was again a long carry, followed by Bond’s favourite second shot on the course—over bunkers and through a valley between high sand-dunes to a distant, taunting flag. It is a testing hole for which the first essential is a well-placed drive. Bond stood on the tee, perched high up in the sand-hills, and paused before the shot while he gazed at the glittering distant sea and at the faraway crescent of white cliffs beyond Pegwell Bay. Then he took up his stance and visualized the tennis court of turf that was his target. He took the club back as slowly as he knew how and started down for the last terrific acceleration before the club head met the ball. There was a dull clang on his right. It was too late to stop. Desperately Bond focused the ball and tried to keep his swing all in one piece. There came the ugly clonk of a mishit ball. Bond’s head shot up. It was a lofted hook. Would it have the legs? Get on！Get on！The ball hit the top of a mountain of rough and bounced over. Would it reach the beginning of the fairway?

Bond turned towards Goldfinger and the caddies, his eyes fierce. Goldfinger was straightening up. He met Bond’s eyes indifferently. “Sorry. Dropped my driver.”

“Don’t do it again,”said Bond curtly. He stood down off the tee and handed his driver to Hawker. Hawker shook his head sympathetically. Bond took out a cigarette and lit it. Goldfinger hit his drive the dead straight regulation two hundred yards.

They walked down the hill in a silence which Goldfinger unexpectedly broke. “What is the firm you work for?”

“Universal Export.”

“And where do they hang out?”

“London. Regent’s Park.”

“What do they export?”

Bond woke up from his angry ruminations. Here, pay attention！This is work, not a game. All right, he put you off your drive, but you’ve got your cover to think about. Don’t let him needle you into making mistakes about it. Build up your story. Bond said casually, “Oh everything from sewing-machines to tanks.”

“What’s your speciality?”Bond could feel Goldfinger’s eyes on him. He said, “I look after the small arms side. Spend most of my time selling miscellaneous ironmongery to sheiks and rajahs—anyone the Foreign Office decides doesn’t want the stuff to shoot at us with.”

“Interesting work.”Goldfinger’s voice was flat, bored.

“Not very. I’m thinking of quitting. Came down here for a week’s holiday to think it out.

Not much future in England. Rather like the idea of Canada.”

“Indeed?”

They were past the rough and Bond was relieved to find that his ball had got a forward kick off the hill on to the fairway. The fairway curved slightly to the left and Bond had even managed to pick up a few feet on Goldfinger. It was Goldfinger to play. Goldfinger took out his spoon. He wasn’t going for the green but only to get over the bunkers and through the valley.

Bond waited for the usual safe shot. He looked at his own lie. Yes, he could take his brassie. There came the wooden thud of a mis-hit. Goldfinger’s ball, hit off the heel, sped along the ground and into the stony wastes of Hell Bunker—the widest bunker and the only unkempt one, because of the pebbles, on the course.

For once Homer had nodded—or rather, lifted his head. Perhaps his mind had been half on what Bond had told him. Good show！But Goldfinger might still get down in three more. Bond took out his brassie. He couldn’t afford to play safe. He addressed the ball, seeing in his mind’s eye its eighty-eight-millimetre trajectory through the valley and then the two or three bounces that would take it on to the green. He laid off a bit to the right to allow for his draw. Now！

There came a soft clinking away to his right. Bond stood away from his ball. Goldfinger had his back to Bond. He was gazing out to sea, rapt in its contemplation, while his right hand played 'unconsciously with the money in his pocket.

Bond smiled grimly. He said, “Could you stop shifting bullion till after my shot?”

Goldfinger didn’t turn round or answer. The noise stopped.

Bond turned back to his shot, desperately trying to clear his mind again. Now the brassie was too much of a risk. It needed too good a shot. He handed it to Hawker and took his spoon and banged the ball safely through the valley. It ran on well and stopped on the apron. A five, perhaps a four.

Goldfinger got well out of the bunker and put his chip dead. Bond putted too hard and missed the one back. Still all square.

The sixth, appropriately called 'The Virgin', is a famous short hole in the world of golf. A narrow green, almost ringed with bunkers, it can need anything from an eight to a two iron according to the wind. Today, for Bond, it was a seven. He played a soaring shot, laid off to the right for the wind to bring it in. It ended twenty feet beyond the pin with a difficult putt over and down a shoulder. Should be a three. Goldfinger took his five and played it straight. The breeze took it and it rolled into the deep bunker on the left. Good news！That would be the hell of a difficult three.

They walked in silence to the green. Bond glanced into the bunker. Goldfinger’s ball was in a deep heel-mark. Bond walked over to his ball and listened to the larks. This was going to put him one up. He looked for Hawker to take his putter, but Hawker was the other side of the green, watching with intent concentration Goldfinger play his shot. Goldfinger got down into the bunker with his blaster. He jumped up to get a view of the hole and then settled himself for the shot. As his club went up Bond’s heart lifted. He was going to try and flick it out—a hopeless technique from that buried lie. The only hope would have been to explode it. Down came the club, smoothly, without hurry. With hardly a handful of sand the ball curved up out of the deep bunker, bounced once and lay dead！

Bond swallowed. Blast his eyes！How the hell had Goldfinger managed that? Now, out of sour grapes, Bond must try for his two. He went for it, missed the hole by an inch and rolled a good yard past. Hell and damnation！Bond walked slowly up to the putt, knocking Goldfinger’s ball away. Come on, you bloody fool！But the spectre of the big swing—from an almost certain one up to a possible one down—made Bond wish the ball into the hole instead of tapping it in. The coaxed ball, lacking decision, slid past the lip. One down！

Now Bond was angry with himself. He, and he alone, had lost that hole. He had taken three putts from twenty feet. He really must pull himself together and get going.

At the seventh, five hundred yards, they both hit good drives and Goldfinger’s immaculate second lay fifty yards short of the green. Bond took his brassie. Now for the equalizer！But he hit from the top, his club head came down too far ahead of the hands and the smothered ball shot into one of the right-hand bunkers. Not a good lie, but he must put it on the green. Bond took a dangerous seven and failed to get it out. Goldfinger got his five. Two down. They halved the short eighth in three. At the ninth Bond, determined to turn only one down, again tried to do too much off a poor lie. Goldfinger got his four to Bond’s five. Three down at the turn！Not too good. Bond asked Hawker for a new ball. Hawker unwrapped it slowly, waiting for Goldfinger to walk over the hillock to the next tee. Hawker said softly, “You saw what he did at The Virgin, sir?”

“Yes, damn him. It was an amazing shot.”

Hawker was surprised. “Oh, you didn’t see what he did in the bunker, sir?”

“No, what? I was too far away.”

The other two were out of sight over the rise. Hawker silently walked down into one of the bunkers guarding the ninth green, kicked a hole with his toe and dropped the ball in the hole. He then stood just behind the half-buried ball with his feet close together. He looked up at Bond. “Remember he jumped up to look at the line to the hole, sir?”

“Yes.”

“Just watch this, sir.”Hawker looked towards the ninth pin and jumped, just as Goldfinger had done, as if to get the line. Then he looked up at Bond again and pointed to the ball at his feet. The heavy impact of the two feet just behind the ball had levelled the hole in which it had lain and had squeezed the ball out so that it was now perfectly teed for an easy shot—for just the easy cut-up shot which had seemed utterly impossible from Goldfinger’s lie at The Virgin.

Bond looked at his caddie for a moment in silence. Then he said, “Thanks, Hawker. Give me the bat and the ball. Somebody’s going to be second in this match, and I’m damned if it’s going to be me.”

“Yes, sir,”said Hawker stolidly. He limped off on the short cut that would take him half way down the tenth fairway.

Bond sauntered slowly over the rise and down to the tenth tee. He hardly looked at Goldfinger who was standing on the tee swishing his driver impatiently. Bond was clearing his mind of everything but cold, offensive resolve. For the first time since the first tee, he felt supremely confident. All he needed was a sign from heaven and his game would catch fire.

The tenth at the Royal St Marks is the most dangerous hole on the course. The second shot, to the skiddy plateau green with cavernous bunkers to right and left and a steep hill beyond, has broken many hearts. Bond remembered that Philip Scrutton, out in four under fours in the Gold Bowl, had taken a fourteen at this hole, seven of them ping-pong shots from one bunker to another, to and fro across the green. Bond knew that Goldfinger would play his second to the apron, or short of it, and be glad to get a five. Bond must go for it and get his four.

Two good drives and, sure enough, Goldfinger well up on the apron with his second. A possible four. Bond took his seven, laid off plenty for the breeze and fired the ball off into the sky. At first he thought he had laid off too much, but then the ball began to float to the left. It pitched and stopped dead in the soft sand blown on to the green from the righthand bunker. A nasty fifteen-foot putt. Bond would now be glad to get a half. Sure enough, Goldfinger putted up to within a yard. That, thought Bond as he squared up to his putt, he will have to hole. He hit his own putt fairly smartly to get it through the powdering of sand and was horrified to see it going like lightning across the skiddy green. God, he was going to have not a yard, but a two-yard putt back！But suddenly, as if drawn by a magnet, the ball swerved straight for the hole, hit the back of the tin, bounced up and fell into the cup with an audible rattle. The sign from heaven！Bond went up to Hawker, winked at him and took his driver.

They left the caddies and walked down the slope and back to the next tee. Goldfinger said coldly, “That putt ought to have run off the green.”

Bond said off-handedly, “Always give the hole a chance！”He teed up his ball and hit his best drive of the day down the breeze. Wedge and one putt? Goldfinger hit his regulation shot and they walked off again. Bond said, “By the way, what happened to that nice Miss Masterton?”

Goldfinger looked straight in front of him. “She left my employ.”

Bond thought, good for her！He said, “Oh, I must get in touch with her again. Where did she go to?”

“I couldn’t say.”Goldfinger walked away from Bond towards his ball. Bond’s drive was out of sight, over the ridge that bisected the fairway. It wouldn’t be more than fifty yards from the pin. Bond thought he knew what would be in Goldfinger’s mind, what is in most golfers' minds when they smell the first scent of a good lead melting away. Bond wouldn’t be surprised to see that grooved swing quicken a trifle. It did. Goldfinger hooked into a bunker on the left of the green.

Now was the moment when it would be the end of the game if Bond made a mistake, let his man off the hook. He had a slightly downhill lie, otherwise an easy chip—but to the trickiest green on the course. Bond played it like a man. The ball ended six feet from the pin. Goldfinger played well out of his bunker, but missed the longish putt. Now Bond was only one down.

They halved the dog-leg twelfth in inglorious fives and the longish thirteenth also in fives, Goldfinger having to hole a good putt to do so.

Now a tiny cleft of concentration had appeared on Goldfinger’s massive, unlined forehead. He took a drink of water from the tap beside the fourteenth tee. Bond waited for him. He didn’t want a sharp clang from that tin cup when it was out-of-bounds over the fence to the right and the drive into the breeze favouring a slice！Bond brought his left hand over to increase his draw and slowed down his swing. The drive, well to the left, was only just adequate, but at least it had stayed in bounds, Goldfinger, apparently unmoved by the out-of-bounds hazard, hit his standard shot. They both negotiated the transverse canal without damage and it was another half in five. Still one down and now only four to play.

The four hundred and sixty yards fifteenth is perhaps the only hole where the long hitter may hope to gain one clear shot. Two smashing woods will just get you over the line of bunkers that lie right up against the green. Goldfinger had to play short of them with his second. He could hardly improve on a five and it was up to Bond to hit a really godlike second shot from a barely adequate drive.

The sun was on its way down and the shadows of the four men were beginning to lengthen. Bond had taken up his stance. It was a good lie. He had kept his driver. There was dead silence as he gave his two incisive waggles. This was going to be a vital stroke. Remember to pause at the top of the swing, come down slow and whip the club head through at the last second. Bond began to take the club back. Something moved at the corner of hisright eye. From nowhere the shadow of Goldfinger’s huge head approached the ball on the ground, engulfed it and moved on. Bond let his swing take itself to pieces in sections. Then he stood away from his ball and looked up. Goldfinger’s feet were still moving. He was looking carefully up at the sky.

“Shades please, Goldfinger.”Bond’s voice was furiously controlled.

Goldfinger stopped and looked slowly at Bond. The eyebrows were raised a fraction in inquiry. He moved back and stood still, saying nothing.

Bond went back to his ball. Now then, relax！To hell with Goldfinger. Slam that ball on to the green. Just stand still and hit it. There was a moment when the world stood still, then… then somehow Bond did hit it—on a low trajectory that mounted gracefully to carry the distant surf of the bunkers. The ball hit the bank below the green, bounced high with the impact and rolled out of sight into the saucer round the pin.

Hawker came up and took the driver out of Bond’s hand. They walked on together. Hawker said seriously, “That’s one of the finest shots I’ve seen in thirty years.”He lowered his voice. “I thought he’d fixed you then, sir.”

“He damned nearly did, Hawker. It was Alfred Blacking that hit that ball, not me.”Bond took out his cigarettes, gave one to Hawker and lit his own. He said quietly, “All square and three to play. We’ve got to watch those next three holes. Know what I mean?”

“Don’t you worry, sir. I’ll keep my eye on him.”

They came up with the green. Goldfinger had pitched on and had a long putt for a four, but Bond’s ball was only two inches away from the hole. Goldfinger picked up his ball and walked off the green. They halved the short sixteenth in good threes. Now there were the two long holes home. Fours would win them. Bond hit a fine drive down the centre.

Goldfinger pushed his far out to the right into deep rough. Bond walked along trying not to be too jubilant, trying not to count his chickens. A win for him at this hole and he would only need a half at the eighteenth for the match. He prayed that Goldfinger’s ball would be unplayable or, better still, lost.

Hawker had gone on ahead. He had already laid down his bag and was busily—far tod busily to Bond’s way of thinking—searching for Goldfinger’s ball when they came up.

It was bad stuff—jungle country, deep thick luxuriant grass whose roots still held last night’s dew. Unless they were very lucky, they couldn’t hope to find the ball. After a few minutes' search Goldfinger and his caddie drifted away still wider to where the rough thinned out into isolated tufts. That’s good, thought Bond. That wasn’t anything like the line. Suddenly he trod on something. Hell and damnation. Should he stamp it in? He shrugged his shoulders, bent down and gently uncovered the ball so as not to improve the lie. Yes it was a Dunlop 65. “Here you are,”he called grudgingly. “Oh no, sorry. You play with a Number One, don’t you?”

“Yes,”came back Goldfinger’s voice impatiently.

“Well, this is a Number Seven.”Bond picked h up and walked over to Goldfinger.

Goldfinger gave the ball a cursory glance. He said, “Not mine,”and went on poking among the tufts with the head of his driver.

It was a good ball, unmarked and almost new. Bond put it in his pocket and went back to his search. He glanced at his watch. The statutory five minutes was almost up. Another half-minute and by God he was going to claim the hole. Strict rules of golf, Goldfinger had stipulated. All right my friend, you shall have them！Goldfinger was casting back towards Bond, diligently prodding and shuffling through the grass.

Bond said, “Nearly time, I’m afraid.”

Goldfinger grunted. He started to say something when there came a cry from his caddie, “Here you are, sir. Number One Dunlop.”

Bond followed Goldfinger over to where the caddie stood on a small plateau of higher ground. He was pointing down. Bond bent and inspected the ball. Yes, an almost new Dun-lop One and in an astonishingly good lie. It was miraculous—more than miraculous.

Bond stared hard from Goldfinger to his caddie. “Must have had the hell of a lucky kick,”he said mildly.

The caddie shrugged his shoulders. Goldfinger’s eyes were calm, untroubled. “So it would seem.”He turned to his caddie. “I think we can get a spoon to that one, Foulks.”

Bond walked thoughtfully away and then turned to watch the shot. It was one of Goldfinger’s best. It soared over a far shoulder of rough towards the green. Might just have caught the bunker on the right.

Bond walked on to where Hawker, a long blade of grass dangling from his wry lips, was standing on the fairway watching the shot finish. Bond smiled bitterly at him. He said in a controlled voice, “Is my good friend in the bunker, or is the bastard on the green?”

“Green, sir,”said Hawker unemotionally.

Bond went up to his ball. Now things had got tough again. Once more he was fighting for a half after having a certain win in his pocket. He glanced towards the pin, gauging the distance. This was a tricky one. He said. “Five or six?”

“The six should do it, sir. Nice firm shot.”Hawker handed him the club.

Now then, clear your mind. Keep it slow and deliberate. It’s an easy shot. Just punch it so that it’s got plenty of zip to get up the bank and on to the green. Stand still and head down. Click！The ball, hit with a slightly closed face, went off on just the medium trajectory Bond had wanted. It pitched below the bank. It was perfect！No, damn it. It had hit the bank with its second bounce, stopped dead, hesitated and then rolled back and down again. Hell’s bells！Was it Hagen who had said, “You drive for show, but you putt for dough'? Getting dead from below that bank was one of the most difficult putts on the course. Bond reached for his cigarettes and lit one, already preparing his mind for the next crucial shot to save the hole—so long as that bastard Goldfinger didn’t hole his from thirty feet！Hawker walked along by his side. Bond said, “Miracle finding that ball.”

“It wasn’t his ball, sir.”Hawker was stating a fact.

“What do you mean?”Bond’s voice was tense.

“Money passed, sir. White, probably a fiver. Foulks must have dropped that ball down his trouser leg.”

“Hawker！”Bond stopped in his tracks. He looked round. Goldfinger and his caddie were fifty yards away, walking slowly towards the green. Bond said fiercely, “Do you swear to that? How can you be sure?”Hawker gave a half-ashamed, lop-sided grin. But there was a crafty belligerence in his eye. “Because his ball was lying under my bag of clubs, sir.”When he saw Bond’s openmouthed expression he added apologetically, “Sorry, sir. Had to do it after what he’s been doing to you. Wouldn’t have mentioned it, but I had to let you know he’s fixed you again.”

Bond had to laugh. He said admiringly, “Well, you are a card, Hawker. So you were going to win the match for me all on your own！”He added bitterly, “But, by God, that man’s the flaming limit. I’ve got to get him. I’ve simply got to. Now let’s think！”They walked slowly on.

Bond’s left hand was in his trousers pocket, absent-mindedly fingering the ball he had picked up in the rough. Suddenly the message went to his brain. Got it！He came close to Hawker. He glanced across at the others. Goldfinger had stopped. His back was to Bond and he was taking the putter out of his bag. Bond nudged Hawker. “Here, take this.”He slipped the ball into the gnarled hand. Bond said softly, urgently, “Be certain you take the flag. When you pick up the balls from the green, whichever way the hole has gone, give Goldfinger this one. Right?”

Hawker walked stolidly forward. His face was expressionless. “Got it, sir,”he said in his normal voice. “Will you take the putter for this one?”

“Yes.”Bond walked up to his ball. “Give me a line, would you?”

Hawker walked up on to the green. He stood sideways to the line of the putt and then stalked round to behind the flag and crouched. He got up. “Inch outside the right lip, sir.Firm putt. Flag, sir?”

“No. Leave it in, would you.”

Hawker stood away. Goldfinger was standing by his ball on the right of the green. His caddie had stopped at the bottom of the slope. Bond bent to the putt. Come on, Calamity Jane！This one has got to go dead or I’ll put you across my knee. Stand still. Club head straight back on the line and follow through towards the hole. Give it a chance. Now！The ball, hit firmly in the middle of the club, had run up the bank and was on its way to the hole. But too hard, damn it！Hit the stick！Obediently the ball curved in, rapped the stick hard and bounced back three inches—dead as a doornail！

Bond let out a deep sigh and picked up his discarded cigarette. He looked over at Goldfinger. Now then, you bastard. Sweat that one out. And by God if you hole it！But Goldfinger couldn’t afford to try. He stopped two feet short. “All right, all right,”said Bond generously. “All square and one to go.”It was vital that Hawker should pick up the balls. If he had made Goldfinger hole the short putt it would have been Goldfinger who would have picked the ball out of the hole. Anyway, Bond didn’t want Goldfinger to miss that putt. That wasn’t part of the plan.

Hawker bent down and picked up the balls. He rolled one towards Bond and handed the other to Goldfinger. They walked off the green, Goldfinger leading as usual. Bond noticed Hawker’s hand go to his pocket. Now, so long as Goldfinger didn’t notice anything on the tee！

But, with all square and one to go, you don’t scrutinize your ball. Your motions are more or less automatic. You are thinking of how to place your drive, of whether to go for the green with the second or play to the apron, of the strength of the wind—of the vital figure four that must somehow be achieved to win or at least to halve.

Considering that Bond could hardly wait for Goldfinger to follow him and hit, just once, that treacherous Dunlop Number Seven that looked so very like a Number One.

Bond’s own drive down the four hundred and fifty yard eighteenth was praiseworthy. If he wanted to, he could now reach the green—if he wanted to！

Now Goldfinger was on the tee.

Now he had bent down. The ball was on the peg, its lying face turned up at him. But Goldfinger had straightened, had stood back, was taking his two deliberate practice swings. He stepped up to the ball, cautiously, deliberately. Stood over it, waggled, focusing the ball minutely. Surely he would see！Surely he would stop and bend down at the last minute to inspect the ball！Would the waggle never end? But now the club head was going back, coming down, the left knee bent correctly in towards the ball, the left arm straight as a ramrod. Crack！The ball sailed off, a beautiful drive, as good as Goldfinger had hit, straight down the fairway.

Bond’s heart sang. Got you, you bastard！Got you！Blithely Bond stepped down from the tee and strolled off down the fairway planning the next steps which could now be as eccentric, as fiendish as he wished. Goldfinger was beaten already—hoist with his own petard！Now to roast him, slowly, exquisitely.

Bond had no compunction. Goldfinger had cheated him twice and got away with it. But for his cheats at the Virgin and the seventeenth, not to mention his improved lie at the third and the various times he had tried to put Bond off, Goldfinger would have been beaten by now. If it needed one cheat by Bond to rectify the score-sheet that was only poetic justice. And besides, there was more to this than a game of golf. It was Bond’s duty to win. By his reading of Goldfinger he had to win. If he was beaten, the score between the two men would have been equalized. If he won the match, as he now had, he would be two up on Goldfinger—an intolerable state of affairs, Bond guessed, to a man who saw himself as all powerful. This man Bond, Goldfinger would say to himself, has something. He has qualities I can use. He is a tough adventurer with plenty of tricks up his sleeve. This is the sort of man I need for—for what? Bond didn’t know. Perhaps there would be nothing for him. Perhaps his reading of Goldfinger was wrong, but there was certainly no other way of creeping up on the man.

Goldfinger cautiously took out his spoon for the longish second over cross-bunkers to the narrow entrance to the green. He made one more practice swing than usual and then hit exactly the right, controlled shot up to the apron. A certain five, probably a four. Much good would it do him！

Bond, after a great show of taking pains, brought his hands down well ahead of the club and smothered his number three iron so that the topped ball barely scrambled over the cross-bunkers. He then wedged the ball on to the green twenty feet past the pin. He was where he wanted to be—enough of a threat to make Goldfinger savour the sweet smell of victory, enough to make Goldfinger really sweat to get his four.

And now Goldfinger really was sweating. There was a savage grin of concentration and greed as he bent to the long putt up the bank and down to the hole. Not too hard, not too soft. Bond could read every anxious thought that would be running through the man’s mind. Goldfinger straightened up again, walked deliberately across the green to behind the flag to verify his line. He walked slowly back beside his line, brushing away—carefully, with the back of his hand—a wisp or two of grass, a speck of top-dressing. He bent again and made one or two practice swings and then stood to the putt, the veins standing out on his temples, the cleft of concentration deep between his eyes.

Goldfinger hit the putt and followed through on the line. It was a beautiful putt that stopped six inches past the pin. Now Goldfinger would be sure that unless Bond sank his difficult twenty-footer, the match was his！

Bond went through a long rigmarole of sizing up his putt. He took his time, letting the suspense gather like a thunder cloud round the long shadows on the livid, fateful green.

“Flag out, please. I’m going to sink this one.”Bond charged the words with a deadly certitude, while debating whether to miss the hole to the right or the left or leave it short. He bent to the putt and missed the hole well on the right.

“Missed it, by God！”Bond put bitterness and rage into his voice. He walked over to the hole and picked up the two balls, keeping them in full view. Goldfinger came up. His face was glistening with triumph. “Well, thanks for the game.Seems I was just too good for you after all.”

“You’re a good nine handicap,”said Bond with just sufficient sourness. He glanced at the balls in his hand to pick out Goldfinger’s and hand it to him. He gave a start of surprise. “Hullo！”He looked sharply at Goldfinger. “You play a Number One Dunlop, don’t you?”

“Yes, of course.”A sixth sense of disaster wiped the triumph off Goldfinger’s face. “What is it? What’s the matter?”

“Well,”said Bond apologetically,“Fraid you’ve been playing with the wrong ball. Here’s my Penfold Hearts and this is a Number Seven Dunlop.”He handed both balls to Goldfinger. Goldfinger tore them off his palm and examined them feverishly.

Slowly the colour flooded over Goldfinger’s face. He stood, his mouth working, looking from the balls to Bond and back to the balls.

Bond said softly, “Too bad we were playing to the rules. Afraid that means you lose the hole. And, of course, the match.”Bond’s eyes observed Goldfinger impassively.

“But, but…”

This was what Bond had been looking forward to—the cup dashed from the lips. He stood and waited, saying nothing.

Rage suddenly burst Goldfinger’s usually relaxed face like a bomb. “It was a Dunlop Seven you found in the rough. It was your caddie that gave me this ball. On the seventeenth green. He gave me the wrong ball on purpose, the damned che—”

“Here, steady on,”said Bond mildly. “You’ll get a slander action on your hands if you aren’t careful. Hawker, did you give Mr Goldfinger the wrong ball by mistake or anything?”

“No, sir.”Hawker’s face was stolid. He said indifferently, “If you want my opinion, sir, the mistake may have been made at the seventeenth when the gentleman found his ball pretty far off the line we’d all marked it on. A Seven looks very much like a One. I’d say that’s what happened, sir. It would have been a miracle for the gentleman’s ball to have ended up as wide as where it was found.”

“Tommy rot！”Goldfinger gave a snort of disgust. He turned angrily on Bond. “You saw that was a Number One my caddie found.”Bond shook his head doubtfully. “I didn’t really look closely, I’m afraid. However,”

Bond’s voice became brisk, businesslike, “it’s really the job of the player to make certain he’s using the right ball, isn’t it? I can’t see that anyone else can be blamed if you tee the wrong ball up and play three shots with it. Anyway,”he started walking off the green, “many thanks for the match. We must have it again one day.”

Goldfinger, lit with glory by the setting sun, but with a long black shadow tied to his heels, followed Bond slowly, his eyes fixed thoughtfully on Bond’s back.





CHAPTER TEN UP AT THE GRANGE


THERE ARE some rich men who use their riches like a club. Bond, luxuriating in his bath, thought that Goldfinger was one of them. He was the kind of man who thought he could flatten the world with his money, bludgeoning aside annoyances and opposition with his heavy wad. He had thought to break Bond’s nerve by playing him for ten thousand dollars—a flea-bite to him but obviously a small fortune to Bond. In most circumstances he might have succeeded. It needs an iron nerve to 'wait for it' on your swing, to keep your head down on the short putts, when big money hangs on every shot, over eighteen long holes. The pros, playing for their own bread and butter and for their families', know the cold breath of the poor-house on the back of their necks as they come to the eighteenth tee all square. That is why they lead careful lives, not smoking or drinking, and why the one that wins is usually the one with the least imagination.

But, in Bond’s case, Goldfinger could not have known that high tension was Bond’s natural way of life and that pressure and danger relaxed him. And he could not have known that Bond wanted to play Goldfinger for the highest possible stakes and that he would have the funds of the Secret Service behind him if he lost. Goldfinger, so used to manipulating others, had been blind to the manipulation for once being practised upon himself.

Or had he been? Thoughtfully Bond got out of the bath and dried himself. That powerful dynamo inside the big round head would be humming at this very moment, wondering about Bond, knowing he had been out-cheated, asking itself how it came about that twice Bond had appeared out of the blue and twice queered his pitch. Had Bond played his cards right? Had he made himself appear an interesting challenge, or would Goldfinger’s sensitive nose smell a threat? In the latter case there would be no follow-up by Goldfinger and Bond would have to bow out of the case and leave it to M to devise a new approach. How soon would he know if the big fish was hooked? This one would take plenty of time sniffing the bait. It would be good to have just one small bite to tell him he had chosen the right lure.

There was a knock on the door of his bedroom. Bond wrapped the towel round him and walked through. He opened the door. It was the hall porter. “Yes?”

“Telephone message from a Mr Goldfinger, sir. His compliments and would you care to come to his house for dinner tonight. It’s the Grange over at Reculver, sir. Six-thirty for drinks beforehand and not to bother to dress.”

“Please thank Mr Goldfinger and say I shall be delighted.”Bond shut the door and walked across to the open window and stood looking out across the quiet evening sea. “Well, well！Talk of the devil！”Bond smiled to himself, “And then go and sup with him！What was that about a long spoon?”

At six o’clock Bond went down to the bar and had a large vodka and tonic with a slice of lemon peel. The bar was empty save for a group of American Air Force officers from Mansion. They were drinking whisky and water and talking baseball. Bond wondered if they had spent the day toting a hydrogen bomb round the skies over Kent, over the four little dots in the dunes that had been his match with Goldfinger. He thought wryly, Not too much of that whisky, cousins, paid for his drink, and left.

He motored slowly over to Reculver, savouring the evening and the drink inside him and the quiet bubble of the twin exhausts. This was going to be an interesting dinnerparty. Now was the moment to sell himself to Goldfinger. If he put a foot wrong he was out, and the pitch would have been badly queered for his successor. He was unarmed—it would be fatal for Goldfinger to smell that kind of rat. He felt a moment’s qualm. But that was going too fast. No state of war had been declared—the opposite if anything. When they had parted at the golf club, Goldfinger had been cordial in a rather forced, oily fashion. He had inquired where he should send Bond’s winnings and Bond had given him the address of Universal Export. He had asked where Bond was staying and Bond had told him and added that he would only be at Ramsgate a few days while he made up his mind about his future. Goldfinger hoped that they would one day have a return match but, alas, he was leaving for France tomorrow and wasn’t certain when he would be back. Flying? Yes, taking the Air Ferry from Lydd. Well, thanks for the match. And thank you, Mr Bond. The eyes had given Bond one last X-ray treatment, as if fixing him for a last time in Goldfinger’s filing system, and then the big yellow car had sighed away.

Bond had had a good look at the chauffeur. He was a chunky flat-faced Japanese, or more probably Korean, with a wild, almost mad glare in dramatically slanting eyes that belonged in a Japanese film rather than in a Rolls Royce on a sunny afternoon in Kent. He had the snout-like upper lip that sometimes goes with a cleft palate, but he said nothing and Bond had no opportunity of knowing whether his guess was right. In his tight, almost bursting black suit and farcical bowler hat he looked rather like a Japanese wrestler on his day off. But he was not a figure to make one smile. If one had been inclined to smile, a touch of the sinister, the unexplained, in the tight shining patent-leather black shoes that were almost dancing pumps, and in the heavy black leather driving gloves, would have changed one’s mind. There was something vaguely familiar to Bond in the man’s silhouette. It was when the car drove away and Bond had a glimpse of the head from the rear that he remembered. Those were the head and shoulders and bowler hat of the driver of the sky-blue Ford Popular that had so obstinately hugged the crown of the Herne Bay road at about twelve o’clock that morning. Where had he been coming from? What errand had he been on? Bond remembered something Colonel Smithers had said. Could this have been the Korean who now travelled the country collecting the old gold from the chain of Goldfinger jewellery shops? Had the boot of the innocent, scurrying little saloon been stuffed with the week’s takings of presentation watches, signet rings, lockets, gold crosses? As he watched the high, primrose-yellow silhouette of the Silver Ghost disappearing towards Sandwich, Bond thought the answer was yes.

Bond turned off the main road into the drive and followed it down between high Victorian evergreens to the gravel sweep in front of just the sort of house that would be called The Grange—a heavy, ugly, turn-of-the-century mansion with a glass-enclosed portico and sun parlour whose smell of trapped sunshine, rubber plants and dead flies came to Bond in his imagination before he had switched off the engine. Bond got slowly out of the car and stood looking at the house. Its blank, well-washed eyes stared back at him. The house had a background noise, a heavy rhythmic pant like a huge animal with a rather quick pulse. Bond assumed it came from the factory whose plumed chimney reared up like a giant cautionary finger from the high conifers to the right where the stabling and garages would normally be. The quiet watchful facade of the house seemed to be waiting for Bond to do something, make some offensive move to which there would be a quick reply. Bond shrugged his shoulders to lighten his thoughts and went up the steps to the opaque glass-panelled door and pressed the bell. There was no noise of it ringing, but the door slowly opened. The Korean chauffeur still had his bowler hat on. He looked without interest at Bond. He stood motionless, his left hand on the inside doorknob and his outstretched right pointing like a signpost into the dark hall of the house.

Bond walked past him, vanquishing a desire either to stamp on his neat black feet or hit him very hard indeed in the centre of his tightly buttoned black stomach. This Korean matched up with what he had always heard about Koreans, and anyway Bond wanted to do something violent to the heavy, electric atmosphere of the house.

The gloomy hall was also the main living-room. A meagre fire flickered behind the fireirons in the wide hearth and two club chairs and a Knole sofa stood impassively watching the flames. Between them on a low settee was a well-stocked drink tray. The wide spaces surrounding this spark of life were crowded with massive Rothschildian pieces of furniture of the Second Empire, and ormolu, tortoiseshell, brass and mother-of-pearl winked back richly at the small fire. Behind this orderly museum, dark panelling ran up to a first-floor gallery which was reached by a heavy curved stairway to the left of the hall. The ceiling was laced with the sombre woodcarving of the period.

Bond was standing taking all this in when the Korean came silently up. He flung out his signpost of an arm towards the drink tray and the chairs. Bond nodded and stayed where he was. The Korean walked past him and disappeared through a door into what Bond assumed were the servants' quarters. The silence, helped by the slow iron tick of a massively decorated grandfather clock, gathered and crept nearer.

Bond walked over and stood with his back to the poor fire. He stared offensively back at the room. What a dump！What a bloody awful deathly place to live in. How did one, could one, live in this rich heavy morgue among the conifers and evergreens when a hundred yards away there was light and air and wide horizons? Bond took out a cigarette and lit it. What did Goldfinger do for enjoyment, for fun, for sex? Perhaps he didn’t need these things. Perhaps the pursuit of gold slaked all his thirsts.

Somewhere in the distance a telephone rang. The bell shrilled twice and stopped. There was the murmur of a voice, then steps echoed down a passage and a door under the stairway opened. Goldfinger came through and quietly closed the door behind him. He was wearing a plum-coloured velvet dinner jacket. He came slowly across the polished wood floor. He didn’t hold out his hand. He said, smiling with his mouth, “It was kind of you to come at such short notice, Mr Bond. You were alone and so was I and it occurred to me that we might discuss the price of corn.”

It was the sort of remark that rich men make to each other. Bond was amused at being made a temporary member of the club. He said, “I was delighted to get the invitation. I was already bored with worrying over my problems. Ramsgate hasn’t much to offer.”

“No. And now I have an apology to make. I have had a telephone call. One of my staff—I employ Koreans, by the way—has had some minor trouble with the Margate police and I must go over and straighten it out. Some incident at the fun fair, I understand. These people get easily overexcited. My chauffeur will drive me and we should not be more than half an hour. Meanwhile I fear I must leave you to your own devices. Please help yourself to drinks. There are magazines to read. Will you forgive me? Not more than half an hour I assure you.”

“That’s quite all right.”Bond felt there was something fishy in this. He couldn’t put his finger on what it was.

“Well then, au revoir.”Goldfinger went to the front door. “But I must give you some light. It’s really very dark in here.”Goldfinger brushed his hand down a wall-plate of switches and suddenly lights blazed all over the hall—from standard lamps, wall brackets, and four clusters in the ceiling. Now the room was as bright as a film studio. It was an extraordinary transformation. Bond, half dazzled, watched Goldfinger open the front door and stride out. In a minute he heard the sound of a car, but not the Rolls, rev up noisily, change gear and go off fast down the drive.

On an instinct, Bond walked over to the front door and opened it. The drive was empty. In the distance he saw the lights of the car turn left-handed on the main road and make off in the direction of Margate. He turned back into the house and closed the door. He stood still, listening. The silence, except for the heavy clock-tick, was complete. He walked across to the service door and opened it. A long dark passage disappeared towards the back of the house. Bond bent forward, all his senses alert. Silence, dead silence. Bond shut the door and looked thoughtfully round the brilliantly lit hall. He had been left alone in Goldfinger’s house, alone with its secrets. Why?

Bond walked over to the drink tray and poured himself a strong gin and tonic. There certainly had been a telephone call, but it could easily have been an arranged call from the factory. The story of the servant was plausible and it was reasonable that Goldfinger should go himself to bail the man out and take his chauffeur with him. Goldfinger had twice mentioned that Bond would be alone for half an hour during which he ‘would be left to his own devices’. This could be innocent, or it could be an invitation for Bond to show his hand, commit some indiscretion. Was somebody watching him? How many of these Koreans were there and what were they doing? Bond glanced at his watch. Five minutes had gone. He made up his mind. Trap or no trap, this was too good a chance to miss. He would have a quick look round—but an innocent one, with some sort of a cover story to explain why he had left the hall. Where should he begin? A look at the factory. His story? That his car had given trouble on the way over—choked petrol feed probably—and that he had gone to see if there was a mechanic who could give him a hand. Flimsy, but it would do. Bond downed his drink and went purposefully to the service door and walked through.

There was a light switch. He turned on the light and walked swiftly down a long passage. It ended with a blank wall and two doors to right and left. He listened for an instant at the left-hand one and heard muffled kitchen noises. He opened the right-hand door and found himself in the paved garage yard he might have expected. The only odd thing about it was that it was brilliantly lit by arc lights. The long wall of the factory occupied the far side and now the rhythmic engine thump was very loud. There was a plain wooden door low down in the wall opposite. Bond walked across the yard to it, looking around him with casual interest. The door was unlocked. He opened it with discretion and walked through, leaving the door ajar. He found himself in a small empty office lit by one naked bulb hanging from the ceiling. There was a desk with papers on it, a time-clock, a couple of filing cabinets and a telephone. Another door led from the office into the main factory space and there was a window beside the door for keeping an eye on the workmen. It would be the foreman’s office. Bond walked to the window and looked through.

Bond didn’t know what he had expected, but there seemed to be the usual accoutrements of a small metal-working business. Facing him were the open mouths of two blast furnaces, their fires now drawn. Beside these stood a row of kilns for the molten metal, of which sheets of different sizes and colours stood against the wall near by. There was the polished steel table of a circular saw, a diamond saw presumably, for cutting the sheets, and to the left in the shadows a big oil engine connected to a generator pounding away making power. To the right, under arc lights, a group of five men in overalls, four of them Koreans, were at work on—of all things—Goldfinger’s Rolls Royce. It stood there gleaming under the lights, immaculate save for the right-hand door which had been taken off its hinges and now lay across two nearby benches minus its door panel. As Bond watched, two men picked up the new door panel, a heavy, discoloured sheet of aluminium-coloured metal, and placed it on the door frame. There were two hand riveters on the floor and soon, Bond thought, the men would rivet the panel into place and paint it to match the rest of the car. All perfectly innocent and above-board. Goldfinger had dented the panel that afternoon and had had a quick repair job done in preparation for his trip tomorrow. Bond gave a quick, sour look round, withdrew from the window and went out by the factory door and closed it softly behind him. Nothing there, damn it. And now what was his story? That he had not wanted to disturb the men at their work—perhaps after dinner, if one of them had a moment.

Bond walked unhurriedly back the way he had come and regained the hall without misadventure.

Bond looked at his watch. Ten minutes to go. Now for the first floor. The secrets of a house are in the bedrooms and bathrooms. Those are the private places where the medicine cabinets, the dressing-table, the bedside drawers, reveal the intimate things, the frailties. Bond had a bad headache. He had gone to look for an aspirin. He acted the part for an invisible audience, massaged his temples, glanced up at the gallery, walked decisively across the floor and climbed the stairs. The gallery gave on to a brightly lit passage. Bond walked down it opening the doors and glancing in. But they were spare bedrooms^ the beds not made up. They held a smell of must and shut windows. A large ginger cat appeared from nowhere and followed him, mewing and rubbing itself against his trouser legs. The end room was the one. Bond went in and closed the door to a crack.

All the lights were on. Perhaps one of the servants was in the bathroom. Bond walked boldly across to the communicating door and opened it. More lights, but no one. It was a big bathroom, probably a spare room converted into a bathroom and, in addition to the bath and lavatory, it held various fitness machines—a rowing machine, a fixed bicycle wheel, Indian clubs and a Ralli Health Belt. The medicine cabinet contained nothing except a great variety of purges—senna pods, cascara, Calsalettes, Enos and various apparatus for the same purpose. There were no other drugs and no aspirin. Bond went back into the bedroom and again drew a blank. It was a typical man’s room, comfortable, lived in, with plenty of fitted cupboards. It even smelled neutral. There was a small bookcase beside the bed in which all the books were history or biography, all in English. The drawer of the bedside table yielded a solitary indiscretion, a yellow-backed copy of The Hidden Sight of Love, Palladium Publications, Paris.

Bond glanced at his watch. Five more minutes. It was time to go. He took a last look round the room and moved to the door. Suddenly he stopped. What was it he had noticed almost subconsciously ever since he had come into the room? He sharpened his senses. There was an incongruity somewhere. What was it? A colour? An object? A smell? A sound? That was it！From where he stood he could hear the faintest, mosquito-shrill whine. It was almost extra-sensory in its pitch. Where did it come from? What was making it? Now there was something else in the room, something that Bond knew all too well, the smell of danger.

Tensely Bond stepped closer to the fitted cupboard beside the door, softly opened it. Yes, it came from inside the cupboard, from behind a range of sports coats that reached down to the top of three banks of drawers. Sharply Bond swept the coats aside. His jaws clenched at what,was behind them.

From three slots near the top of the cupboard, sixteen-millimetre film was inching down in three separate strips into a deep bin behind the false front of the drawers. The bin was almost half full of the slimy snakes of the stuff. Bond’s eyes narrowed tensely as he watched the damning evidence coil slowly down on to the pile. So that was it—cinecameras, three of them, their lenses concealed God knows where—in the hall, in the garage courtyard, in this room—had been watching his every move from the moment Goldfinger had left the house, switching on the cameras, and, of course, the dazzling lights, as he went out of the door. Why hadn’t Bond seen the significance of those lights? Why hadn’t he had the elementary imagination to see the trap as well as smell it? Cover stories, indeed！What use were they now when he had spent half an hour snooping round and finding nothing for his pains? That too！He had discovered nothing—unearthed no secret. It had all been an idiotic waste of time. And now Goldfinger had him. Now he was finished, hopelessly blown. Was there any way of saving something from the wreckage? Bond stood riveted, staring at the slow cataracts of film.

Let’s see now！Bond’s mind raced, thinking of ways out, excuses, discarding them all. Well, at least by opening the cupboard door he had exposed some of the film. Then why not expose it all? Why not, but how? How could the open cupboard door be explained except by his doing? There came a miaow from the open slit of the bedroom door. The cat！Why shouldn’t the cat have done it? Pretty thin, but at least it was the shadow of an alibi. Bond opened the door. He picked the cat up in his arms. He went back with it to the cupboard, stroking it brusquely. It purred. Bond leant over the bin of film, picking it up in handfuls so that it would all get the light. Then, when he was satisfied that it must be ruined, he tossed it back and dropped the cat in on top of it. The cat would not be able to get out easily. With any luck it would settle down and go to sleep. Bond left the cupboard door three inches ajar to spoil the continuing film and the bedroom door the same amount and ran down the passage. At the top of the stairs he slowed and sauntered down. The empty hall yawned at his play-acting. He walked across to the fireplace, dashed more drink into his glass and picked up The Field. He turned to the golf commentary by Bernard Darwin, ran his eye down it to see what it was about, and then settled into one of the club chairs and lit a cigarette.

What had he found out? What was there on the plus side? Precious little except that Goldfinger suffered from constipation and a dirty mind and that he had wanted to put Bond through an elementary test. He had certainly done it expertly. This was no amateur. The technique was fully up to SMERSH standards, and it was surely the technique of somebody with a very great deal to hide. And now what would happen? For the cat alibi to stand up, Goldfinger would have to have left two doors, one of them vital, ajar, and the cat had got into the room and been intrigued by the whine of the cameras. Most unlikely, almost incredible. Goldfinger would be ninety per cent certain it was Bond—but only ninety. There would still be that ten per cent of uncertainty. Would Goldfinger have learnt much more than he knew before—that Bond was a tricky, resourceful customer and that Bond had been inquisitive, might be a thief? He would guess Bond had been to the bedroom, but Bond’s other movements, for whatever they were worth, would remain a secret on the exposed film.

Bond got up and took a handful of other magazines and threw them down beside his chair. The only thing for him to do was brazen it out and make a note for the future, if there was to be a future, that he had better wake his ideas up and not make any more mistakes. There wouldn’t be enough ginger cats in the world to help him out of one more tight spot like the one he was in.

There had been no noise of a car coming down the drive, not a sound from the door, but Bond felt the evening breeze on his neck and he knew that Goldfinger had come back into the room.





CHAPTER ELEVEN THE ODD-JOB MAN


BOND THREW down The Field and stood up. The front door closed noisily. Bond turned. “Hullo.”His face registered polite surprise. “Didn’t hear you arrive. How did it go?”

Goldfinger’s expression was equally bland. They might have been old friends, neighbours in the country who were accustomed to drop in on each other for a drink. “Oh, it sorted itself out. My chap had had a row in a pub with some American Air Force men who had called him a bloody Jap. I explained to the police that Koreans don’t like being called Japs. They let him off with a caution. Terribly sorry to have been so long. Hope you weren’t bored. Do have another drink.”

“Thanks. But it’s hardly seemed five minutes since you left. Been reading what Darwin has to say about the fourteen club rule. Interesting point of view.”Bond launched into a detailed review of the article, adding his own comments on the rule.

Goldfinger stood patiently until it was over. He said, “Yes, it’s a complicated business. Of course you play rather a different game from me, more workmanlike. With my kind of swing, I find I need all the clubs I’m allowed. Well, I’ll just go up and wash and then we’ll have dinner. Shan’t be a moment.”

Bond busied himself noisily with pouring another drink, sat down and picked up Country Life. He watched Gold finger climb the stairs and disappear down the corridor. He could visualize every step. He found he was reading the periodical upside down. He turned it round and stared blindly at a fine photograph of Blenheim Palace.

There was dead silence upstairs. Then a distant lavatory chain was pulled and a door clicked shut. Bond reached for his drink, took a deep swallow and put the glass down beside his chair. Goldfinger was coming down the stairs. Bond turned the pages of Country Life and flicked ash off his cigarette into the grate.

Now Goldfinger was crossing the floor towards him. Bond lowered his paper and looked up. Goldfinger was carrying the ginger cat tucked carelessly under one arm. He reached the fireplace, bent forward and pressed the bell.

He turned towards Bond. “Do you like cats?”His gaze was flat, incurious.

“Sufficiently.”

The service door opened. The chauffeur stood in the frame. He still wore his bowler hat and his shiny black gloves. He gazed impassively at Goldfinger. Goldfinger crooked a finger. The chauffeur approached and stood within the circle by the fire.

Goldfinger turned to Bond. He said conversationally, “This is my handy man.”He smiled thinly. “That is something of a joke. Oddjob, show Mr Bond your hands.”He smiled again at Bond. “I call him Oddjob because that describes his functions on my staff.”

The Korean slowly pulled off his gloves and came and stood at arm’s length from Bond and held out his hands palm upwards. Bond got up and looked at them. They were big and fat with muscle. The fingers all seemed to be the same length. They were very blunt at the tips and the tips glinted as if they were made of yellow bone.

“Turn them over and show Mr Bond the sides.”

There were no fingernails. Instead there was this same, yellowish carapace. The man turned the hands sideways. Down each edge of the hands was a hard ridge of the same bony substance.

Bond raised his eyebrows at Goldfinger.

Goldfinger said, “We will have a demonstration.”He pointed at the thick oak banisters that ran up the stairs. The rail was a massive six inches by four thick. The Korean obediently walked over to the stairs and climbed a few steps. He stood with his hands at his sides, gazing across at Goldfinger like a good retriever. Goldfinger gave a quick nod. Impassively the Korean lifted his right hand high and straight above his head and brought the side of it down like an axe across the heavy polished rail. There was a splintering crash and the rail sagged, broken through the centre. Again the hand went up and flashed down. This time it swept right through the rail leaving a jagged gap. Splinters clattered down on to the floor of the hall. The Korean straightened himself and stood to attention, waiting for further orders. There was no flush of effort in his face and no hint of pride in his achievement.

Goldfinger beckoned. The man came back across the floor. Goldfinger said, “His feet are the same, the outside edges of them. Oddjob, the mantelpiece.”Goldfinger pointed at the heavy shelf of carved wood above the fireplace. It was about seven feet off the ground—six inches higher than the top of the Korean’s bowler hat.

“Garch a har?”

“Yes, take off your coat and hat.”Goldfinger turned to Bond. “Poor chap’s got a cleft palate. I shouldn’t think there are many people who understand him beside me.”

Bond reflected how useful that would be, a slave who could only communicate with the world through his interpreter—better even than the deaf mutes of the harems, more tightly bound to his master, more secure.

Oddjob had taken off his coat and hat and placed them neatly on the floor. Now he rolled his trouser legs up to the knee and stood back in the wide well-planted stance of the judo expert. He looked as if a charging elephant wouldn’t put him off balance.

“Better stand back, Mr Bond.”The teeth glittered in the wide mouth. “This blow snaps a man’s neck like a daffodil.”Goldfinger drew aside the low settee with the drink tray. Now the Korean had a clear run. But he was only three long steps away. How could he possibly reach the high mantelpiece?

Bond watched, fascinated. Now the slanting eyes in the flat yellow mask were glinting with a fierce intentness. Faced by such a man, thought Bond, one could only go down on one’s knees and wait for death.

Goldfinger lifted his hand. The bunched toes in the polished soft leather shoes seemed to grip the ground. The Korean took one long crouching stride with knees well bent and then whirled off the ground. In mid-air his feet slapped together like a ballet dancer’s, but higher than a ballet dancer’s have ever reached, and then the body bent sideways and downwards and the right foot shot out like a piston. There came a crashing thud. Gracefully the body settled back down on the hands, now splayed on the floor, the elbows bent to take the weight and then straightened sharply to throw the man up and back on his feet.

Oddjob stood to attention. This time there was a gleam of triumph in his flat eyes as he looked at the three-inch jagged bite the edge of his foot had taken out of the mantelpiece.

Bond looked at the man in deep awe. And only two nights ago, he, Bond, had been working on his manual of unarmed combat！There was nothing, absolutely nothing, in all his reading, all his experience, to approach what he had just witnessed. This was not a man of flesh and blood. This was a living club, perhaps the most dangerous animal on the face of the earth. Bond had to do it, had to give homage to this uniquely dreadful person.

He held out his hand.

“Softly, Oddjob.”Goldfinger’s voice was the crack of a whip.

The Korean bowed his head and took Bond’s hand in his. He kept his fingers straight and merely bent his thumb in a light clasp. It was like holding a piece of board. He released Bond’s hand and went to his neat pile of clothes.

“Forgive me, Mr Bond, and I appreciate your gesture.”Goldfinger’s face showed his approval. “But Oddjob doesn’t know his own strength—particularly when he is keyed up.And those hands are like machine-tools. He could have crushed your hand to pulp without meaning to. Now then,”Oddjob had dressed and was standing respectfully at attention, “you did well, Oddjob. I’m glad to see you are in training. Here”—Goldfinger took the cat from under his arm and tossed it to the Korean who caught it eagerly—“I am tired of seeing this animal around. You may have it for dinner.”The Korean’s eyes gleamed. “And tell them in the kitchen that we will have our own dinner at once.”

The Korean inclined his head sharply and turned away.

Bond hid his disgust. He realized that all this exhibition was simply a message to him, a warning, a light rap on the knuckles. It said, “You see my power, Mr Bond. I could easily have killed you or maimed you. Oddjob was giving an exhibition and you got in the way.

I would certainly be innocent, and Oddjob would get off with a light sentence. Instead, the cat will be punished in your place. Bad luck on the cat, of course.”

Bond said casually, “Why does the man always wear that bowler hat?”

“Oddjob！”The Korean had reached the service door. “The hat.”Goldfinger pointed at a panel in the woodwork near the fireplace.

Still holding the cat under his left arm, Oddjob turned and walked stolidly back towards them. When he was half way across the floor, and without pausing or taking aim, he reached up to his hat, took it by the rim and flung it sideways with all his force. There was a loud clang. For an instant the rim of the bowler hat stuck an inch deep in the panel Goldfinger had indicated, then it fell and clattered on the floor.

Goldfinger smiled politely at Bond. “A light but very strong alloy, Mr Bond. I fear that will have damaged the felt covering, but Oddjob will put on another. He’s surprisingly quick with a needle and thread. As you can imagine, that blow would have smashed a man’s skull or half severed his neck. A homely and a most ingeniously concealed weapon, I’m sure you’ll agree.”

“Yes, indeed.”Bond smiled with equal politeness. “Useful chap to have around.”Oddjob had picked up his hat and disappeared. There came the boom of a gong. “Ah, dinner！Shall we go in?”Goldfinger led the way to a door concealed in the panelling to the right of the fireplace. He pressed a hidden latch and they walked through.

The small dining-room matched the heavy wealth of the hall. It was brilliantly lit from a central chandelier and by candles on a round table that glittered with silver and glass. They sat down opposite each other. Two yellow-faced servants in white mess-jackets brought dishes from a loaded serving-table. The first course was some curried mess with rice. Goldfinger noticed Bond’s hesitation. He gave a dry chuckle. “It’s all right, Mr Bond.Shrimp, not the cat.”

“Ah.”Bond’s expression was non-committal.

“Please try the Moselle. I hope it will be to your taste. It is a Piesporter Goldtropfchen ‘53. Help yourself. These people are as likely to pour it into your plate as your glass.”There was a slim bottle in an ice bucket in front of Bond. He poured some of the wine and tasted it. It was nectar and ice cold. Bond congratulated his host. Goldfinger gave a curt nod.

“I don’t myself drink or smoke, Mr Bond. Smoking, I find the most ridiculous of all the varieties of human behaviour and practically the only one that is entirely against nature.Can you imagine a cow or any animal taking a mouthful of smouldering straw then breathing in the smoke and blowing it out through its nostrils? Pah！”Goldfinger showed a rare trace of emotion. “It is a vile practice. As for drinking, I am something of a chemist and I have yet to find a liquor that is free from traces of a number of poisons, some of them deadly, such as fusel oil, acetic acid, ethylacetate, acetal-dehyde and furfurol. A quantity of some of these poisons taken neat would kill you. In the small amounts you find in a bottle of liquor they produce various ill effects most of which are lightly written off as ‘a hangover’.”Goldfinger paused with a forkful of curried shrimp half way to his mouth. “Since you are a drinker, Mr Bond, I will give you one word of good advice. Never drink so-called Napoleon brandy, particularly when it is described as ‘aged in the wood’. That particular potion contains more of the poisons I have mentioned than any other liquor I have analysed. Old bourbon comes next.”Goldfinger closed his animadversions with a mouthful of shrimp. “Thank you. I’ll remember. Perhaps for those reasons I have recently taken to vodka. They tell me its filtration through activated charcoal is a help.”Bond, dredging this piece of expertise out of dim recollections of something he had read, was rather proud of having been able to return Goldfinger’s powerful serve.

Goldfinger glanced at him sharply. “You seem to understand something of these matters.Have you studied chemistry?”

“Only dabbled in it.”It was time to move on. “I was very impressed by that chauffeur of yours. Where did he learn that fantastic combat stuff? Where did it come from? Is that what the Koreans use?”

Goldfinger patted his mouth with his napkin. He snapped his fingers. The two men cleared away the plates and brought roast duckling and a bottle of Mouton Rothschild 1947 for Bond. When they had withdrawn into immobility at each end of the servingtable, Goldfinger said, “Have you ever heard of Karate? No? Well that man is one of the three in the world who have achieved the Black Belt in Karate. Karate is a branch of judo, but it is to judo what a Spandau is to a catapult.”

“I could see that.”

“The demonstration was an elementary one. Mr Bond,”Goldfinger held up the drumstick he had been gnawing—“I can tell you that if Oddjob had used the appropriate single blow on any one of seven spots on your body, you would,now be dead.”Goldfinger bit at the side of the drumstick with relish.

Bond said seriously, “That’s interesting. I only know five ways of killing Oddjob with one blow.”

Goldfinger seemed not to hear the comment. He put down his drumstick and took a deep draught of water. He sat back and spoke while Bond went on eating the excellent food. “Karate, Mr Bond, is based on the theory that the human body possesses five striking surfaces and thirty-seven vulnerable spots—vulnerable, that is, to an expert in Karate whose finger-tips, the side of the hands and the feet are hardened into layers of corn, which is far stronger and more flexible than bone. Every day of his life, Mr Bond, Oddjob spends one hour hitting either sacks of unpolished rice or a strong post whose top is wound many times round with thick rope. He then spends another hour at physical training which is more that of a ballet school than of a gymnasium.”

“When does he practise tossing the bowler hat?”Bond had no intention of succumbing to this psychological warfare.

Goldfinger frowned at the interruption. “I have never inquired,”he said without humour. “But I think you can take it that Oddjob keep his eye in at all his skills. However, you were asking where Karate originated. It originated in China where wandering Buddhist priests became an easy prey for footpads and bandits. Their religion did not allow them to carry weapons, so they developed their own form of unarmed combat. The inhabitants of Okinawa refined the art to its present form when the Japanese forbade them to carry weapons. They developed the five striking surfaces of the human body—the fist, the edge of the hand, the fingertips, the ball of the foot and the elbows—and toughened them until they were enveloped in layers of corn. There is no follow-through in a Karate blow. The entire body is stiffened at the moment of impact, with the emphasis on the hips, and then instantly relaxed so that balance is never lost. It is astonishing what Oddjob can do. I have seen him hit a brick wall with his entire force and not hurt his hand. He can split three half-inch thick boards, piled one upon the other, with one blow of the hand. You have seen what he can do with his foot.”

Bond took a deep draught of the delicious claret. “All this must be rather hard on your furniture.”

Goldfinger shrugged. “I have no more use for this house. I thought a demonstration would amuse you. I hope you agree that Oddjob earned his cat.”The X-ray eyes blazed briefly across the table.

“Does he train on cats?”

“He regards them as a great delicacy. He acquired the taste during a famine in his country when he was young.”

Bond thought it was time to delve rather more deeply. “Why do you need such a man? He can’t be very good company.”

“Mr Bond,”Goldfinger snapped his fingers for the two servants—it happens that I am a rich man, a very rich man, and the richer the man the more he needs protection. The ordinary bodyguard or detective is usually a retired policeman. Such men are valueless. Their reactions are slow, their methods old-fashioned, and they are open to bribery. Moreover, they have a respect for human life. That is no good if I wish to stay alive. The Koreans have no such feelings. That is why the Japanese employed them as guards for their prison camps during the war. They are the cruellest, most ruthless people in the world. My own staff are hand picked for these qualities. They have served me well. I have no complaints. Nor have they. They are well paid and well fed and housed. When they want women, street women are brought down from London, well remunerated for their services and sent back. The women are not much to look at, but they are white and that is all the Koreans ask—to submit the white race to the grossest indignities. There are sometimes accidents but,”the pale eyes gazed blankly down the table—'money is an effective winding-sheet.”

Bond smiled.

“You like the aphorism? It is my own.”

An excellent cheese souffle came and was followed by coffee. They ate in silence, both apparently comfortable and relaxed by these confidences. Bond certainly was. Goldfinger, obviously by design, was letting his hair down—not far, not farther than his shoulders, but he was showing Bond one of his private faces, presumably the one to which he thought Bond would respond—the ruthlessly efficient, cold-blooded tycoon. Perhaps, after all, Bond’s spying in the house, which Goldfinger must at least presume, had revealed something about Bond that Goldfinger was pleased to know—that Bond had a crooked side to him, that he wasn’t ‘a gentleman’ in more than appearance. Now there should be more probing and then, with luck, the proposition would follow.

Bond sat back and lit a cigarette. He said, “That’s a beautiful car you’ve got. Must be about the last of the series. About 1925, wasn’t it—two blocks of three cylinders with two plugs for each cylinder, one set fired from the mag. and the other from the coil?”

“You are correct. But in other respects. I have had to introduce some modifications. I have added five leaves to the springs and fitted disc brakes to the rear wheels to increase the braking power. The Servo-operated front-wheel brakes were not sufficient.”

“Oh. Why not? The top speed wouldn’t be more than fifty. The body can’t be all that heavy.”

Goldfinger raised his eyebrows. “You think not? One ton of armour plating and armourplated glass make a big difference.”

Bond smiled. “Ah！I see. You certainly do take good care of yourself. But how does that work flying the Channel? Doesn’t the car go through the floor of the plane?”T take a plane to myself. The Silver City company knows the car. It is a regular routine, twice a year.”

“Just touring round Europe?”

“A golfing holiday.”

“Great fun. Always wanted to do it myself.”

Goldfinger didn’t take the bait. “You can afford to now.”Bond smiled. “Oh, that extra ten thousand dollars.

But I may need that if I decide to move to Canada.”

“You think you could make money there? Do you want to make a lot of money?”

Bond’s voice was eager. “Very much. There’s no other point in working.”

“Unfortunately most ways of making big money take a long time. By the time one has made the money one is too old to enjoy it.”

“That’s the trouble. I’m always on the lookout for shortcuts. You won’t find them here.Taxation’s too heavy.”

“Quite. And the laws are strict.”

“Yes. I found that out.”

“Indeed?”

“Got on the fringe of the heroin racket. Only just got out without burning my fingers. Of course this'll go no further?”

Goldfinger shrugged his shoulders. “Mr Bond, someone said that “law is the crystallized prejudices of the community”. I agree with that definition. It happens to apply most strongly to the traffic in drugs. Even if it didn’t, I am not concerned with assisting the police.”

“Well, it was like this…”Bond launched into the story of the Mexican traffic, swapping roles with Blackwell. He ended up, “I was lucky to get away with it, but it didn’t make me particularly popular with Universal Export.”

“I daresay not. An interesting story. You seem to have shown resource. You are not tempted to continue in the same line of business?”

Bond shrugged his shoulders. “A bit too tricky. To judge by this Mexican, the big men in the business aren’t quite big enough when it comes to the pinch. When things got tough he didn’t fight back—except with his mouth.”

“Well, Mr Bond,”Goldfinger got up from the table and Bond followed suit. “It’s been an interesting evening. I don’t know that I would go back into heroin. There are safer ways of making big money. You want to be certain that the odds are right and then you should hazard everything. Doubling one’s money isn’t easy and the chances don’t occur frequently. You would like to hear another of my aphorisms?”

“Yes.”

“Well, Mr Bond,”Goldfinger gave the rich man’s thin smile. “The safest way to double your money is fold it twice and put it in your pocket.”

Bond, the bank clerk barkening to the bank manager, smiled dutifully but made no comment. This just wasn’t good enough. He was getting nowhere. But instinct told him not to put his foot down on the accelerator.

They went back into the hall. Bond held out his hand. “Well, many thanks for the excellent dinner. Time I went and got some sleep. Perhaps we shall run into each other again some day.”

Goldfinger pressed Bond’s hand briefly and pushed it away from him. It was another mannerism of the millionaire subconsciously afraid of ‘the touch’. He looked hard at Bond. He said enigmatically, “I shouldn’t be at all surprised, Mr Bond.”

On his way across the Isle of Thanet in the moonlight, Bond turned the phrase over and over in his mind. He undressed and got into bed thinking of it, unable to guess its significance. It could mean that Goldfinger intended to get in touch with Bond, or it could mean that Bond must try and keep in touch with Goldfinger. Heads the former, tails the latter. Bond got out of bed and took a coin from the dressing-table and tossed it. It came down tails. So it was up to him to keep close to Goldfinger！

So be it. But his cover would have to be pretty darn good the next time they 'ran into' each other. Bond got back into bed and was instantly asleep.





CHAPTER TWELVE LONG TAIL ON A GHOST


PUNCTUALLY AT nine the next morning Bond got on to the Chief of Staff, “James here. I’ve had a look at the property. Been all over it. Had dinner last night with the owner. I can say pretty well for certain that the managing director’s view is right. Something definitely wrong about the property. Not enough facts to send you a surveyor’s report.

Owner’s going abroad tomorrow, flying from Ferryfield. Wish I knew his departure time. Like to have another sight of his Rolls. Thought I’d make him a present of a portable wireless set. I’ll be going over a bit later in the day. Could you get Miss Ponsonby to book me? Destination unknown for the present. I’ll be keeping in touch. Anything your end?”

“How did the game of golf go?”

“I won.”There was a chuckle at the other end. “Thought you had. Pretty big stakes, weren’t they?”

“How did you know?”

“Had Mr Scotland on last night. Said he’d had a tip on the telephone that someone of your name was in possession of a large amount of undeclared dollars. Had we got such a person and was it true? Chap wasn’t very senior and didn’t know about Universal. Told him to have a word with the Commissioner and we got an apology this morning about the same time as your secretary found an envelope containing ten thousand dollars in your mail！Pretty sly of your man, wasn’t it?”Bond smiled. Typical of Goldfinger to have thought of a way of getting him into trouble over the dollars. Probably made the call to Scotland Yard directly after the game. He had wanted to show Bond that if you gave Goldfinger a knock you’d get at least a thorn in your hand. But the Universal Export cover seemed to have stuck. Bond said, “That’s pretty hot！The twister！You might tell the managing director that this time it goes to the White Cross. Can you fix the other things?”

“Of course. Call you back in a few minutes. But watch your step abroad and call us at once if you get bored and need company. So long.”

“Bye.”Bond put down the receiver. He got up and set about packing his bag. He could see the scene in the Chief of Staff’s office as the conversation was played back off the tape while the Chief of Staff translated the call to Miss Money-penny. “Says he agrees that Goldfinger is up to something big but he can’t make out what. G. is flying this morning with his Rolls from Ferryfield. 007 wants to follow. (Let’s say two hours later to let G. get well away on the other side. Fix the reservation, would you?) He wants us to have a word with Customs so that he can take a good look at the Rolls and plant a Homer in the boot.(Fix that too, please.) He’ll keep in touch through stations in case he needs help…”

And so forth. It was an efficient machine. Bond finished packing and, when the London call came giving him his various clearances, he went downstairs, paid his bill and got quickly out of Ramsgate on to the Canterbury road.

London had said that Goldfinger was booked on a special flight leaving at twelve. Bond got to Ferryfield by eleven, made himself known to the Chief Passport Control and the Customs officers who were expecting him, had his car taken out of sight into an empty hangar and sat and smoked and talked minor shop with the passport men. They thought he was from Scotland Yard. He let them go on thinking it. No, he said, Goldfinger was all right. It was possible that one of his servants was trying to smuggle something out of the country. Rather confidential. If Bond could just be left alone with the car for ten minutes? He wanted to have a look at the tool kit. Would the Customs give the rest of the Rolls their Grade A going over for hidden compartments? They'd be glad to do so.

At eleven-forty-five one of the Customs men put his head round the door. He winked at Bond. “Coming in now. Chauffeur on board. Going to ask both to board the plane before the car. Tell them it’s something to do with the weight distribution. Not so phoney as it sounds. We know this old crate. She’s armour-plated. Weighs about three tons. Call you when we’re ready.”

“Thanks.”The room emptied. Bond took the fragile little parcel out of his pocket. It contained a dry-cell battery wired to a small vacuum tube. He ran his eye over the wiring and put the apparatus back in his coat pocket and waited.

At eleven-fifty-five the door opened. The officer beckoned. “No trouble. They’re on the plane.”

The huge gleaming Silver Ghost stood in the Customs bay out of sight of the plane. The only other car was a dove-grey Triumph TR3 convertible with its hood down. Bond went to the back of the Rolls. The Customs men had unscrewed the plate of the spare tool compartment. Bond pulled out the tray of tools and made a show of minutely examining them and the tray. He knelt down. Under cover of rummaging at the sides of the compartment, he slipped the battery and tube into the back of it. He replaced the tool tray. It fitted all right. He stood up and brushed his hands together. “Negative,”he said to the Customs officer.

The officer fitted the plate on and screwed it down with the square key. He stood up. “Nothing funny about the chassis or the bodywork. Plenty of room in the frame and upholstery but we couldn’t get at them without doing a major job. All right to go?”

“Yes, and thanks.”Bond walked back into the office. He heard the quick solid whine of the old self-starter. A minute later, the car came out of the bay and idled superbly over to the loading ramp. Bond stood at the back of the office and watched it being eased up the ramp. The big jaws of the Bristol Freighter clanged shut. The chocks were jerked away and the dispatcher raised a thumb. The two engines coughed heavily and fired and the great silver dragonfly trundled off towards the runway.

When the plane was on the runway, Bond walked round to his car and climbed into the driver’s seat. He pressed a switch under the dash. There was a moment’s silence, then a loud harsh howl came from the hidden loud-speaker. Bond turned a knob. The howl diminished to a deep drone. Bond waited until he heard the Bristol take off. As the plane rose and made for the coast the drone diminished. In five minutes it had gone. Bond tuned the set and picked it up again. He followed it for five minutes as the plane made off across the Channel and then switched the set off. He motored round to the Customs bay, told the AA that he would be back at one-thirty for the two o’clock flight, and drove slowly off towards a pub he knew in Rye. From now on, so long as he kept within about a hundred miles of the Rolls, the Homer, the rough radio transmitter he had slipped into its tool compartment, would keep contact with Bond’s receiver. All he had to do was watch the decibels and not allow the noise to fade. It was a simple form of direction finding which allowed one car to put a “long tail”on another and keep in touch without any danger of being spotted. On the other side of the Channel, Bond would have to discover the road Goldfinger had taken out of Le Touquet, get well within range and close up near big towns or wherever there was a major fork or crossroads. Sometimes Bond would make a wrong decision and have to do some fast motoring to catch up again. The DB III would look after that. It was going to be fun playing hare and hounds across Europe. The sun was shining out of a clear sky. Bond felt a moment’s sharp thrill down his spine. He smiled to himself, a hard, cold, cruel smile. Goldfinger, he thought, for the first time in your life you’re in trouble—bad trouble.

There is always an agent cycliste at the dangerous crossroads where Le Touquet’s quiet N38 meets the oily turbulence of the major Nl. Yes, certainly he had seen the Rolls. One could not fail to remark it. A real aristocrat of a car. To the right, monsieur, towards Abbeville. He will be an hour ahead, but with that bolide of yours…！

As soon as Bond had cleared his papers at the airport, the Homer had picked up the drone of the Rolls. But it was impossible to tell if Goldfinger was heading north—for the Low Countries or Austria or Germany—or if he was off to the south. For that sort of fix you needed two radio cars to get a bearing. Bond raised a hand to the agent and gave his engine the gun. He would have to close up fast. Goldfinger would be through Abbeville and would already have taken the major fork on to Nl for Paris or N28 for Rouen. A lot of time and distance would be wasted if Bond made the wrong guess.

Bond swept along the badly cambered road. He took no chances but covered the fortythree kilometres to Abbeville in a quarter of an hour. The drone of the Homer was loud. Goldfinger couldn’t be more than twenty miles ahead. But which way at the fork? On a guess Bond took the Paris road. He beat the car along. For a time there was little change in the voice of the Homer. Bond could be right or wrong. Then, imperceptibly, the drone began to fade. Blast！Turn back or press on fast and take one of the secondary roads across to Rouen and catch up with him there? Bond hated turning back. Ten kilometres short of Beauvais he turned right. For a time it was bad going but then he was on to the fast N30 and could afford to drift into Rouen, led on by the beckoning voice of his pickup. He stopped on the outskirts of the town and listened with one ear while consulting his Michelin. By the waxing drone he could tell that he had got ahead of Goldfinger. But now there was another vital fork, not quite so easy to retrieve if Bond guessed wrong again. Either Goldfinger would take the Alengon-Le Mans-Tours route to the south, or he meant to move south-east, missing Paris, by way of Evreux, Chartres and Orleans. Bond couldn’t afford to get closer to the centre of Rouen and perhaps catch a glimpse of the Rolls and of the way it would take. He would have to wait until the Homer went on the wane and then make his own guess.

It was a quarter of an hour later before Bond could be sure that the Rolls was well past. This time he again took the left leg of the fork. He thrust the pedal into the floor and hurried. Yes. This time the drone was merging into a howl. Bond was on the track. He slowed to forty, tuned down his receiver to a whisper and idled along, wondering where Goldfinger was heading for.

Five o’clock, six, seven. The sun set in Bond’s driving mirror and still the Rolls sped on. They were through Dreux and Chartres and on to the long straight fifty-mile stretch into Orleans. If that was to be the night stop the Rolls wouldn’t have done badly at all—over two hundred and fifty miles in something over six hours. Goldfinger was certainly no slouch when it came to motoring. He must be keeping the old Silver Ghost at maximum outside the towns. Bond began to close up.

There were rear-lights ahead—dim ones. Bond had his fog lights on. He switched on the Marchals. It was some little sports car. Bond closed up. MG? Triumph? Austin Healey? It was a pale grey Triumph two-seater with the hood up. Bond blinked his lights and swept past. Now there was the glare of another car ahead. Bond dowsed his headlamps and drove on the fogs. The other car was a mile down the road. Bond crept up on it. At a quarter of a mile, he flashed the Marchals on and off for a quick look. Yes, it was the Rolls. Bond dropped back to a mile and stayed there, vaguely noticing the dim lights of the TR3 in his mirror. On the outskirts of Orleans, Bond pulled into the side of the road. The Triumph growled casually past.

Bond had never cared for Orleans. It was a priest and myth ridden town without charm or gaiety. It was content to live off Joan of Arc and give the visitor a hard, holy glare while it took his money. Bond consulted his Michelin. Goldfinger would stop at five-star hotels and eat fillets of sole and roast chicken. It would be the Arcades for him—perhaps the Moderne. Bond would have liked to stay outside the town and sleep on the banks of the Loire in the excellent Auberge de la Montespan, his belly full of quenelles de brocket. He would have to stick closer to his fox. He decided on the Hotel de la Gare and dinner at the station buffet.

When in doubt, Bond always chose the station hotels. They were adequate, there was plenty of room to park the car and it was better than even chances that the Buffet de la Gare would be excellent. And at the station one could hear the heartbeat of the town. The night-sounds of the trains were full of its tragedy and romance.

The drone on the receiver had stayed constant for ten minutes. Bond noted his way to the three hotels and cautiously crept into the town. He went down to the river and along the lighted guais. He had been right. The Rolls was outside the Arcades. Bond turned back into the town and made for the station.

The Hotel de la Gare was all he had expected—cheap, old-fashioned, solidly comfortable. Bond had a hot bath, went back to his car to make sure the Rolls hadn’t moved, and walked into the station restaurant and ate one of his favourite meals—two aeufs cocotte a la creme, a large sole meuniere (Orleans was close enough to the sea. The fish of the Loire are inclined to be muddy) and an adequate Camembert. He drank a welliced pint of Rose d'Anjou and had a Hennessy’s Three Star with his coffee. At ten-thirty he left the restaurant, checked on the Rolls and walked the virtuous streets for an hour. One more check on the Rolls and bed.

At six o’clock the next morning the Rolls hadn’t moved. Bond paid his bill, had a cafe complet—with a double ration of coffee—at the station, motored down to the quais and backed his car up a side street. This time he could not afford to make a mistake. Goldfinger would either cross the river and head south to join N7 for the Riviera, or he would follow the north bank of the Loire, also perhaps for the Riviera, but also on the route for Switzerland and Italy. Bond got out of the car and lounged against the parapet of the river wall, watching between the trunks of the plane trees. At eight-thirty, two small figures came out of the Arcades. The Rolls moved off. Bond watched it follow the quais until it was out of sight, then he got behind the wheel of the Aston Martin and set off in pursuit.

Bond motored comfortably along the Loire in the early summer sunshine. This was one of his favourite corners of the world. In May, with the fruit trees burning white and the soft wide river still big with the winter rains, the valley was green and young and dressed for love. He was thinking this when, before Chateauneuf, there was a shrill scream from twin Bosch horns and the little Triumph tore past. The hood was down. There was the blur of a pretty face hidden by white motoring goggles with dark blue lenses. Although Bond only saw the edge of a profile—a slash of red mouth and the fluttering edge of black hair under a pink handkerchief with white spots, he knew she was pretty from the way she held her head. There was the authority of someone who is used to being admired, combined with the self-consciousness of a girl driving alone and passing a man in a smart car.

Bond thought：That would happen today！The Loire is dressed for just that—chasing that girl until you run her to ground at lunch-time, the contact at the empty restaurant by the river, out in the garden under the vine trellis. The friture and the ice-cold Vouvray, the cautious sniffing at each other and then the two cars motoring on in convoy until that evening, well down to the south, there would be the place they had agreed on at lunch—olive trees, crickets singing in the indigo dusk, the discovery that they liked each other and that their destinations could wait. Then, next day ('No, not tonight. I don’t know you well enough, and besides I’m tired') they would leave her car in the hotel garage and go off in his at a tangent, slowly, knowing there was no hurry for anything, driving to the west, away from the big roads. What was that place he had always wanted to go to, simply because of the name? Yes, Entre Deux Seins, a village near Les Baux. Perhaps there wasn’t even an inn there. Well, then they would go on to Les Baux itself, at the Bouches du Rhone on the edge of the Camargue. There they would take adjoining rooms (not a double room, it would be too early for that) in the fabulous Baumaniere, the only hotelrestaurant in France with Michelin’s supreme accolade. They would eat the gratin de langouste and perhaps, because it was traditional on such a night, drink champagne. And then……

Bond smiled at his story and at the dots that ended it. Not today. Today you’re working. Today is for Goldfinger, not for love. Today the only scent you may smell is Goldfinger’s expensive after-shave lotion, not… what would she use? English girls made mistakes about scent. He hoped it would be something slight and clean. Balmain’s Vent Vert perhaps, or Caron’s Muguet. Bond tuned up his receiver for reassurance, then hushed it and motored on, relaxed, playing with his thoughts of the girl, filling in the details. Of course he might meet up with her again. They seemed to be keeping pretty close company. She must have spent the night in Orleans. Where? What a waste. But wait a minute！Suddenly Bond woke up from his daydreaming. The open hood reminded him. He’d seen that Triumph before. It had been at Ferryfield, must have taken the flight after Goldfinger. It was true he hadn’t seen the girl or noted the registration number, but surely it was the same. If so, for her to be still on Goldfinger’s tail after three hundred miles was more than coincidence. And she had been driving with dimmed lights the night before！Here, what’s going on?

Bond stepped on the accelerator. He was approaching Nevers. He’d anyway have to close up for the next big turning. He would kill two birds with one stone and also see what the girl was up to. If she was keeping station somewhere between him and Goldfinger there would have to be some furious thinking. And it would be a blasted nuisance. It was hard enough keeping up with Goldfinger. With another tail sandwiched between them, it would become hellish difficult.

She was still there, perhaps two miles behind the Rolls, keeping well back. As soon as he caught sight of her little glittering rump (as he described it to himself ) Bond slowed. Well, well！Who was she? What the hell was all this about? Bond motored on, his face morose and thoughtful.

The little convoy kept on, still following the wide black sheen of N7 that runs like a thick, dangerous nerve down through the heart of France. But at Moulins Bond nearly lost the scent. He had to double back quickly and get on to N73. Goldfinger had turned at right angles and was now making for Lyons and Italy, or for Macon and Geneva. Bond had to do some fast motoring, and then was only just in time to avoid running into trouble. He had not worried much about the pitch of the Homer. He had counted on a sight of the Triumph to slow him down. Suddenly he realized that the drone was becoming a howl. If he hadn’t braked hard down from the ninety he was doing, he would have been on top of. the Rolls. As it was, he was barely creeping along when he came over a rise and saw the big yellow car stopped by the wayside a mile ahead. There was a blessed cart-track. Bond swerved into it and stopped under cover of a low hedge. He took a small pair of binoculars out of the glove compartment, got out of the car and walked back. Yes, damn it！Goldfinger was sitting below a small bridge on the bank of a stream. He was wearing a white dust coat and white linen driving helmet in the style of German tourists. He was eating, having a picnic. The sight made Bond hungry. What about his own lunch? He examined the Rolls. Through the rear window he could see part of the Korean’s black shape in the front seat. There was no sign of the Triumph. If the girl had still been on Goldfinger’s tail she would have had no warning. She would have just kept her head down and stepped on the gas. Now she would be somewhere ahead, waiting in ambush for the Rolls to come by. Or would she? Perhaps Bond’s imagination had run away with him. She was probably on her way to the Italian lakes to join an aunt, some friends, a lover.

Now Goldfinger was on his feet. Tidy man. That’s right, pick up the scraps of paper and tuck them away carefully under the bridge. Why not throw them in the stream? Suddenly Bond’s jaw tightened. What did those actions of Goldfinger remind him of? Was Bond romancing again, or was the bridge a post box? Had Goldfinger been instructed to leave something, one of his bars of gold, under this particular bridge? France, Switzerland, Italy. It was convenient for all of them—the Communist cell in Lyons for instance, one of the strongest in France. And this was a good place to use with a clear field of view up and down the road.

Goldfinger scrambled up the bank. Bond drew back under cover. He heard the distant grind of the old self-starter. He cautiously watched the Rolls until it had disappeared.

It was a pretty bridge over a pretty stream. It had a survey number set in the arch—79/6—the sixth bridge from some town on N79. Easy to find. Bond got quickly out of the car and slid down the shallow bank. It was dark and cool under the arch. There were the shadows of fish in the slow, clear, pebbled water. Bond searched the edge of the masonry near the grass verge. Exactly in the centre, below the road, there was a patch of thick grass against the wall. Bond parted the grass. There was a sprinkling of freshly turned earth. Bond dug with his fingers.

There was only one. It was smooth to the touch and brick-shaped. It needed some strength to lift it. Bond brushed the earth off the dull yellow metal and wrapped the heavy bar in his handkerchief. He held the bar under his coat and climbed back up the bank on to the empty road.





CHAPTER THIRTEEN “IF YOU TOUCH ME THERE…”


BOND FELT pleased with himself. A whole lot of people were going to get very angry with Goldfinger. You can do a lot of dirty work with twenty thousand pounds. Now plans would have to be altered, conspiracies postponed, perhaps even lives saved. And, if it ever got to an inquiry by SMERSH, which was unlikely as they were the sort of realistic people who cut their losses, it could only be assumed that some sheltering tramp had found the gold bar.

Bond lifted the secret flap under the passenger seat and slipped the bar inside. Dangerous stuff. He would have to contact the next station of the Service and hand it over to them. They would get it back to London in the Embassy bag. Bond would have to report this quickly. It confirmed a lot. M might even want to warn the Deuxieme and have the bridge watched to see who came. But Bond hoped that would not happen. He didn’t want a scare started just when he was getting close to Goldfinger. He wanted the skies over Goldfinger to be blue and clear.

Bond got moving. Now there were other things to think about. He must catch up with the Rolls before Macon and get the next fork, to Geneva or Lyons, right. He must solve the problem of the girl and if possible get her off the road. Pretty or not, she was confusing the issue. And he must stop and buy himself something to eat and drink. It was one o’clock and the sight of Goldfinger eating had made him hungry. And it was time to fill up and check the water and oil.

The drone of the Homer grew louder. He was in the outskirts of Macon. He must close up and take the risk of being spotted. The busy traffic would hide his low-slung car. It was vital to know if the Rolls crossed the Saone for the Bourg road or if it turned right at the bridge and joined the N6 for Lyons. Far down the Rue Rambuteau there was a glimpse of yellow. Over the railway bridge and through the little square. The high yellow box kept on towards the river. Bond watched the passers-by turn their heads to follow the gleaming Rolls. The river. Would Goldfinger turn right or keep on across the bridge? The Rolls kept straight on. So it was Switzerland！Bond followed over into the suburb of St Laurent. Now for a butcher and a baker and a wine shop. A hundred yards ahead the golden head of a calf hung over the pavement. Bond glanced in his driving mirror. Well, well！The little Triumph was only feet away from his tail. How long had she been there? Bond had been so intent on following the Rolls that he hadn’t glanced back since entering the town. She must have been hiding up a street. So！Now coincidence was certainly out. Something must be done. Sorry, sweetheart. I’ve got to mess you up. I’ll be as gentle as I can. Hold tight. Bond stopped abruptly in front of the butcher’s shop. He banged the gears into reverse. There was a sickening scrunch and tinkle. Bond switched off his engine and got out.

He walked round to the back of the car. The girl, her face tense with anger, had one beautiful silken leg on the road. There was an indiscreet glimpse’ of white thigh. The girl stripped off her goggles and stood, legs braced and arms akimbo. The beautiful mouth was taut with anger.

The Aston Martin’s rear bumper was locked into the wreckage of the Triumph’s lamps and radiator grille. Bond said amiably, “If you touch me there again you’ll have to marry me.”

The words were hardly out of his mouth before the open palm cracked across his face. Bond put up a hand and rubbed his cheek. Now there was quite a crowd. There was a murmur of approval and ribaldry. “Allez y la gosse！Main-tenant le knock-out！”

The girl’s rage had not dissipated with the blow. “You bloody fool！What the hell do you think you’re doing?”

Bond thought：If only pretty girls were always angry they would be beautiful. He said, “Your brakes can’t be up to much.”

“My brakes！What the hell do you mean? You reversed into me.”

“Gears slipped. I didn’t know you were so close.”It was time to calm her down. “I’m most frightfully sorry. I’ll pay for all the repairs and everything. It really is bad luck. Let’s see what the damage is. Try and back away. Doesn’t look as if our bumpers have over-ridden.”Bond put a foot on the Triumph’s bumpers and rocked.

“Don’t you dare touch my car！Leave it alone.”Angrily the girl climbed back into the driver’s seat. She pressed the self-starter. The engine fired. Metal clanged under the bonnet. She switched off and leant out. “There you are, you idiot！You’ve smashed the fan.”

Bond had hoped he had. He got into his own car and eased it away from the Triumph. Bits of the Triumph, released by Bond’s bumper, tinkled on to the road. He got out again.

The crowd had thinned. There was a man in a mechanic’s overalls. He volunteered to call a breakdown van and went off to do so. Bond walked over to the Triumph. The girl had got out and was waiting for him. Her expression had changed. Now she was more composed. Bond noticed that her eyes, which were dark blue, watched his face carefully.

Bond said, “It really won’t be too bad. Probably knocked the fan out of alignment. They’ll put temporary headlamps in the sockets and straighten up the chrome. You’ll be off again by tomorrow morning. Now,”Bond reached into his pocket for his notecase,”this is maddening for you and I’ll certainly take all the blame. Here’s a hundred thousand francs to cover the damage and your expenses for the night and telephoning your friends and so on. Please take it and call it quits. I’d love to stay here and see you get on the road all right tomorrow morning. But I’ve got an appointment this evening and I’ve simply got to make it.”

“No.”The one word was cool, definite. The girl put her hands behind her back and waited.

“But…”What was it she wanted, the police? Have him charged with dangerous driving?

“I’ve got an appointment this evening too. I’ve got to make it. I’ve got to get to Geneva. Will you please take me there? It’s not far. Only about a hundred miles. We could do it in two hours in that.”She gestured at the DB III. “Will you? Please?”

There was a desperate urgency in the voice. No cajolery, no threats, only a blazing need.

For the first time Bond examined her as more than a pretty girl who perhaps—they were the only explanations Bond had found to fit the facts—wanted to be picked up by Goldfinger or had a blackmail on him. But she didn’t look capable of either of these things. There was too much character in the face, too much candour. And she wasn’t wearing the uniform of a seductress. She wore a white, rather masculine cut, heavy silk shirt. It was open at the neck, but it would button up to a narrow military collar. The shirt had long wide sleeves gathered at the wrists. The girl’s nails were unpainted and her only piece of jewellery was a gold ring on her engagement finger (true or false?). She wore a very wide black stitched leather belt with double brass buckles. It rose at the back to give some of the support of a racing driver’s corset belt. Her short skirt was charcoal-grey and pleated. Her shoes were expensive-looking black sandals which would be comfortable and cool for driving. The only touch of colour was the pink handkerchief which she had taken off her head and now held by her side with the white goggles. It all looked very attractive. But the get-up reminded Bond more of an equipment than a young girl’s dress. There was something faintly mannish and open-air about the whole of her behaviour and appearance. She might, thought Bond, be a member of the English women’s ski team, or spend a lot of her time in England hunting or show-jumping.

Although she was a very beautiful girl she was the kind who leaves her beauty alone.

She had made no attempt to pat her hair into place. As a result, it looked as a girl’s hair should look—untidy, with bits that strayed and a rather crooked parting. It provided the contrast of an uneven, jagged dark frame for the pale symmetry of the face, the main features of which were blue eyes under dark brows, a desirable mouth, and an air of determination and independence that came from the high cheek-bones and the fine line of the jaw. There was the same air of self-reliance in her figure. She held her body proudly—her fine breasts out-thrown and unashamed under the taut silk. Her stance, with feet slightly parted and hands behind her back, was a mixture of provocation and challenge.

The whole picture seemed to say, “Now then, you handsome bastard, don’t think you can "little woman" me. You’ve got me into this mess and, by God, you’re going to get me out！You may be attractive, but I’ve got my life to run, and I know where I’m going.”

Bond weighed her request. How much of a nuisance would she be? How soon could he get rid of her and get on with his business? Was there any security risk? Against the disadvantages, there was his curiosity about her and what she was up to, the memory of the fable he had spun round her and which had now taken its first step towards realization, and, finally, the damsel-in-distress business—any woman’s appeal for help.

Bond said curtly, “I’ll be glad to take you to Geneva. Now then,”he opened up the back of the Aston Martin, “let’s get your things in. While I fix up about the garage here’s some money. Please buy us lunch—anything you like for yourself. For me, six inches of Lyon sausage, a loaf of bread, butter, and half a litre of Macon with the cork pulled.”

Their eyes met and exchanged a flurry of masculine/feminine master/slave signals. The girl took the money. “Thank you. I’ll get the same things for myself.”She went to the boot of the Triumph and unlocked it. “No, don’t bother. I can manage these.”She hauled out a bag of golf clubs with a cover zipped shut and a small, expensive looking suitcase. She brought them over to the Aston Martin and, rejecting Bond’s offer of help, fitted them in alongside Bond’s suitcase. She watched him lock the back of the car and went back to the Triumph. She took out a wide, black-stitched leather shoulder bag.

Bond said, “What name and address shall I give?”

“What?”

Bond repeated his question, wondering if she would lie about the name or the address, or both.

She said, “I shall be moving about. Better say the Bergues at Geneva. The name’s Soames. Miss Tilly Soames.”There was no hesitation. She went into the butcher’s shop.

A quarter of an hour later they were on their way.

The girl sat upright and kept her eyes on the road. The drone on the Homer was faint. The Rolls must have gained fifty miles. Bond hurried. They flashed through Bourg and over the river at Pont d'Ain. Now they were in the foothills of the Jura and there were the S-bends of N84. Bond went at them as if he was competing in the Alpine Trials. After the girl had swayed against him twice she kept her hand on the handle on the dash and rode with the car as if she were his spare driver. Once, after a particularly sharp dry skid that almost took them over the side, Bond glanced at her profile. Her lips were parted and her nostrils slightly flared. The eyes were alight. She was enjoying herself.

They came to the top of the pass and there was the run down towards the Swiss frontier. Now the Homer was sending out a steady howl. Bond thought, I must take it easy or we shall be running into them at the Customs. He put his hand under the dash and tuned the noise down. He pulled in to the side of the road. They sat in the car and ate a polite but almost silent picnic, neither making any attempt at conversation, both, it seemed, with other things on their minds. After ten minutes, Bond got going again. He sat relaxed, motoring easily down the curving road through the young whispering pines.

The girl said, “What’s that noise?”

“Magneto whine. Gets worse when I hurry. Started at Orleans. Have to get it fixed tonight.”She seemed satisfied with this mumbo-jumbo. She said diffidently, “Where are you heading for? I hope I haven’t taken you very far out of your way.”Bond said in a friendly voice, “Not at all. As a matter of fact, I’m going to Geneva too.But I may not stop there tonight. May have to get on. Depends on my meeting. How long will you be there?”

“I don’t know. I’m playing golf. There’s the Swiss Women’s Open Championship at Divonne. I’m not really that class, but I thought it would be good for me to try. Then I was going to play on some of the other courses.”

Fair enough. No reason why it shouldn’t be true. But Bond was certain it wasn’t the whole truth. He said, “Do you play a lot of golf? What’s your home course?”

“Quite a lot. Temple.”

It had been an obvious question. Was the answer true, or just the first golf course she had thought of? 'Do you live near there?”

“I’ve got an aunt who lives at Henley. What are you doing in Switzerland. Holiday?”

“Business. Import and Export.”

“Oh.”

Bond smiled to himself. It was a stage conversation. The voices were polite stage voices. He could see the scene, beloved of the English theatre—the drawing-room, sunshine on hollyhocks outside french windows, the couple sitting on the sofa, on the edge of it, she pouring out the tea. “Do you take sugar?”

They came out into the foothills. There was a long straight stretch of road and in the distance the small group of buildings of the French Customs.

The girl gave him no chance to get a glimpse of her passport. As soon as the car stopped she said something about tidying up and disappeared into the 'Dames'. Bond had gone through the Controle and was dealing with the triptyque when she reappeared, her passport stamped. At the Swiss Customs she chose the excuse of getting something out of her suitcase. Bond hadn’t got time to hang about and call her bluff.

Bond hurried on into Geneva and pulled up at the imposing entrance of the Bergues. The baggagiste took her suitcase and golf clubs. They stood together on the steps. She held out her hand. “Goodbye.”There was no melting of the candid blue eyes. “And thank you. You drive beautifully.”Her mouth smiled. “I’m surprised you got into the wrong gear at Macon.”

Bond shrugged. “It doesn’t often happen. I’m glad I did. If I can get my business finished, perhaps we could meet again.”

“That would be nice.”The tone of voice said it wouldn’t be. The girl turned and went in through the swingdoors.

Bond ran down to his car. To hell with her！Now to pick up Goldfinger. Then to the little office on the Quai Wilson. He tuned the Homer and waited a couple of minutes. Goldfinger was close, but moving away. He could either be following the right or the left bank of the lake. From the pitch of the Homer, he was at least a mile outside the town. Which way? To the left towards Lausanne? To the right towards Evian? The DB III was already on the left-hand road. Bond decided to follow its nose. He got moving.

Bond caught up with the high yellow silhouette just before Coppet, the tiny lakeside hamlet made famous by Madame de Stael. He hid behind a lorry. At his next reconnaissance the Rolls had disappeared. Bond motored on, watching to the left. At the entrance to the village, big solid iron gates were closing in a high wall. Dust hung in the air. Above the wall was a modest placard. It said, in faded yellow on blue, ENTREPRISES AURIC A.G. The fox had gone to earth！

Bond went on until he found a turning to the left. He followed this until there was a lane which led back through the vineyards to the woods behind Coppet and to the chateau of Madame de Stael. Bond stopped among the trees. Now he should be directly above the Entreprises Auric. He took his binoculars, got out and followed a foot-path down towards the village. Soon, on his right, was a spiked iron railing. There was rolled barbed wire along its top. A hundred yards lower down the hill the railing merged into a high stone wall. Bond walked slowly back up the path looking for the secret entrance the children of Coppet would have made to get at the chestnut trees. He found it—two bars of the railing widened to allow a small body through. Bond stood on the lower railing with all his weight, widened the gap by another couple of inches and wormed his way through.

Bond walked warily through the trees, watching each step for dead branches. The trees thinned. There were glimpses of a huddle of low buildings behind a small manoir. Bond picked the thick trunk of a fir tree and got behind it. Now he was looking down on the buildings. The nearest was about a hundred yards away. There was an open courtyard. In the middle of the courtyard stood the dusty Silver Ghost.

Bond took out the binoculars and examined everything minutely.

The house was a well-proportioned square block of old red brick with a slate roof. It consisted of two storeys and an attic floor. It would probably contain four bedrooms and two principal rooms. The walls were partly covered by a very old wistaria in full bloom. It was an attractive house. In his mind’s eye Bond could see the white-painted panelling inside. He smelled the sweet musty sunshiny smell of the rooms. The back door gave on to the wide paved courtyard in which stood the Rolls. The courtyard was open on Bond’s side but closed on the other two sides by single-storey corrugated iron workshops. A tall zinc chimney rose from the angle of the two workshops. The chimney was topped by a zinc cowl. On top of the zinc cowl was the revolving square mouth of what looked to Bond like a Decca radar scanner you see on the bridges of most ships. The apparatus whirled steadily round. Bond couldn’t imagine what purpose it served on the roof of this little factory among the trees.

Suddenly the silence and immobility of the peaceful scene were broken. It was as if Bond had put a penny in the slot of a diorama on Brighton pier. Somewhere a tinny clock struck five. At the signal, the back door of the house opened and Goldfinger came out, still dressed in his white linen motoring coat, but without the helmet. He was followed by a nondescript, obsequious little man with a toothbrush moustache and horn-rimmed spectacles. Goldfinger looked pleased. He went up to the Rolls and patted its bonnet. The other man laughed politely. He took a whistle out of his waistcoat pocket and blew it. A door in the right-hand workshop opened and four workmen in blue overalls filed out and walked over to the car. From the open door they had left there came a whirring noise and a heavy engine started up and settled into the rhythmic pant Bond remembered from Reculver.

The four men disposed themselves round the car. At a word from the little man, who was presumably the foreman, they began to take the car to pieces.

By the time they had lifted the four doors off their hinges, removed the bonnet cover from the engine and had set about the rivets on one of the mudguards, it was clear that they were methodically stripping the car of its armour plating.

Almost as soon as Bond had come to this conclusion, the black, bowler-hatted figure of Oddjob appeared at the back door of the house and made some sort of a noise at Goldfinger. With a word to the foreman, Goldfinger went indoors and left the workmen to it.

It was time for Bond to get going. He took a last careful look round to fix the geography in his mind and edged back among the trees.

“I am from Universal Export.”

“Oh yes?”Behind the desk there was a reproduction of the Annigoni portrait of the Queen. On the other walls were advertisements for Ferguson tractors and other agricultural machinery. From outside the wide window came the hum of traffic along the Quai Wilson. A steamer hooted. Bond glanced out of the window and watched it ride across the middle distance. It left an enchanted wake across the flawless evening mirror of the lake. Bond looked back into the politely inquiring eyes in the bland, neutral, businessman’s face.

“We were hoping to do business with you.”

“What sort of business?”

“Important business.”

The man’s face broke into a smile. He said cheerfully, “It’s 007, isn’t it? Thought I recognized you. Well now, what can I do for you?”The voice became cautious. “Only one thing, better make it quick and get along. There’s been the hell of a heat on since the Dumont business. They've got me taped—the locals and Redland. All very peaceful of course, but you won’t want them sniffing round you.”

“I thought it might be like that. It’s only routine. Here.”Bond unbuttoned his shirt and took out the heavy chunk of gold. “Get that back, would you? And transmit this when you have a chance.”The man pulled a pad towards him and wrote in shorthand to Bond’s dictation.

When the man had finished he put the pad in his pocket. “Well, well！Pretty hot stuff. Wilco. My routine’s at midnight. This”—he indicated the gold , “can go to Berne for the bag. Anything else?”

“Ever heard of the ‘Entreprises Auric’ at Coppet? Know what they do?”

“I know what every engineering business in the area does. Have to. Tried to sell them some hand riveters last year. They make metal furniture. Pretty good stuff. The Swiss railways take some of it, and the airlines.”

“Know which airlines?”

The man shrugged. “I heard they did all the work for Mecca, the big charter line to India.Their terminus is Geneva. They’re quite a big competitor with All-India. Mecca’s privately owned. Matter of fact, I did hear that “Auric & Co. had some money in it. No wonder they’ve got the contract for the seating.”

A slow, grim smile spread across Bond’s face. He got up and held out his hand. “You don’t know it, but you’ve just done a whole jigsaw puzzle in under a minute. Many thanks. Best of luck with the tractor business. Hope we’ll meet again one day.”

Out in the street, Bond got quickly into his car and drove along the quai to the Bergues.

So that was the picture！For two days he’d been trailing a Silver Ghost across Europe. It was an armour-plated Silver Ghost. He’d watched the last bit of plating being riveted on in Kent, and the whole lot being stripped off at Coppet. Those sheets would already be in the furnaces at Coppet, ready to be modelled into seventy chairs for a Mecca Constellation. In a few days' time those chairs would be stripped off the plane in India and replaced with aluminium ones. And Goldfinger would have made what? Half a million pounds? A million?

For the Silver Ghost wasn’t silver at all. It was a Golden Ghost—all the two tons of its bodywork. Solid, eighteen-carat, white gold.





CHAPTER FOURTEEN THINGS THAT GO THUMP IN THE NIGHT


JAMES BOND booked in at the Hotel des Bergues, took a bath and shower and changed his clothes. He weighed the Walther PPK in his hand and wondered whether he should take it or leave it behind. He decided to leave it. He had no intention of being seen when he went back to the Entreprises Auric. If, by dreadful luck, he was seen, it would spoil everything to get into a fight. He had his story, a poor one, but at least one that would not break his cover. He would have to rely on that. But Bond did choose a particular pair of shoes that were rather heavier than one could expect from their casual build.

At the desk he asked if Miss Soames was in. He was not surprised when the receptionist said they had no Miss Soames staying in the hotel. The only question was whether she had left the hotel when Bond was out of sight or had registered under another name.

Bond motored across the beautiful Pont du Mont Blanc and along the brightly lit quai to the Bavaria, a modest Alsatian brasserie that had been the rendezvous of the great in the days of the League of Nations. He sat by the window and drank Enzian washed down with pale Lowenbrau. He thought first about Goldfinger. There was now no doubt what he was up to. He financed a spy network, probably SMERSH, and he made fortunes smuggling gold to India, the country where he could get the biggest premium. After the loss of his Brixham trawler, he had thought out this new way. He first made it known that he had an armoured car. That would only be considered eccentric. Many English bodybuilders exported them. They used to go to Indian rajahs; now they went to oil sheiks and South American presidents. Goldfinger had chosen a Silver Ghost because, with his modifications, the chassis was strong enough, the riveting was already a feature of the bodywork, and there was the largest possible area of metal sheeting. Perhaps Goldfinger had run it abroad once or twice to get Ferryfield used to it. Then, on the next trip, he took off the armour plating in his works at Reculver. He substituted eighteen-carat white gold. Its alloy of nickel and silver would be strong enough. The colour of the metal would not betray him if he got in a smash or if the bodywork were scratched. Then off to Switzerland and to the little factory. The workmen would have been as carefully picked as the ones at Reculver. They would take off the plates and mould them into aircraft seats which would then be upholstered and installed in Mecca Airlines—run presumably by some stooge of Goldfinger’s who got a cut on each ‘gold run’. On these runs—once, twice, three times a year?—the plane would accept only light freight and a few passengers. At Bombay or Calcutta the plane would need an overhaul, be re-equipped. It would go to the Mecca hangar and have new seats fitted. The old ones, the gold ones, would go to the bullion brokers. Goldfinger would get his sterling credit in Nassau or wherever he chose. He would have made his hundred, or two hundred, per cent profit and could start the cycle all over again, from the 'We Buy Old Gold' shops in Britain to Reculver—Geneva—Bombay.

Yes, thought Bond, gazing out across the glistening, starlit lake, that’s how it would be—a top-notch smuggling circuit with a minimum risk and maximum profit. How Goldfinger must smile as he pressed the bulb of the old boa-constrictor horn and swept past the admiring policemen of three countries！He certainly seemed to have the answer—the philosopher’s stone, the finger of gold！If he hadn’t been such an unpleasant man, if he wasn’t doing all this to sustain the trigger finger of SMERSH, Bond would have felt admiration for this monumental trickster whose operations were so big that they worried even the Bank of England. As it was, Bond only wanted to destroy Goldfinger, seize his gold, get him behind bars. Goldfinger’s gold-lust was too strong, too ruthless, too dangerous to be allowed the run of the world.

It was eight o’clock. The Enzian, the firewater distilled from gentian that is responsible for Switzerland’s chronic alcoholism, was beginning to warm Bond’s stomach and melt his tensions. He ordered another double and with it a chouc-route and a carafe of Fondant.

And what about the girl, this pretty, authoritarian joker that had suddenly been faced in the deal? What in hell was she about? What about this golf story? Bond got up and went to the telephone booth at the back of the room. He got on to the Journal de Geneve and through to the sports editor. The man was helpful, but surprised at Bond’s question. No. The various championships were of course played in the summer when the other national programmes were finished and it was possible to lure a good foreign entry to Switzerland. It was the same with all other European countries. They liked to bring in as many British and American players as possible. It increased the gates. “Pas de quoi, monsieur.”

Bond went back to his table and ate his dinner. So much for that. Whoever she was, she was an amateur. No professional would use a cover that could be broken down by one telephone call. It had been in the back of Bond’s mind—reluctantly, because he liked the girl and was excited by her—that she could, she just could have been an agent of SMERSH sent to keep an eye on Goldfinger, or Bond or both. She had some of the qualities of a secret agent, the independence, the strength of character, the ability to walk alone. But that idea was out. She hadn’t got the training.

Bond ordered a slice of gruyere, pumpernickel and coffee. No, she was an enigma. Bond only prayed that she hadn’t got some private plot involving either him or Goldfinger that was going to mess up his own operation.

And his own job was so nearly finished！All he needed was the evidence of his own eyes that the story he had woven round Goldfinger and the Rolls was the truth. One look into the works at Coppet—one grain of white gold dust—and he could be off to Berne that very night and be on to the duty officer over the Embassy scrambler. Then, quietly, discreetly, the Bank of England would freeze Goldfinger’s accounts all over the world and perhaps, already tomorrow, the Special Branch of the Swiss police would be knocking on the door of Entreprises Auric. Extradition would follow, Goldfinger would go to Brixton, there would be a quiet, rather complicated case in one of the smuggling courts like Maidstone or Lewes. Goldfinger would get a few years, his naturalization would be revoked and his gold hoard, illegally exported, would trickle back into the vaults below the Bank of England. And SMERSH would gnash its blood-stained teeth and add another page to Bond’s bulging zapiska.

Time to go for the last lap. Bond paid his bill and went out and got into his car. He crossed the Rhone and motored slowly along the glittering quai through the evening traffic. It was an average night for his purpose. There was a blazing three-quarter moon to see by, but not a breath of wind to hide his approach through the woods to the factory. Well, there was no hurry. They would probably be working through the night. He would have to take it very easily and carefully. The geography of the place and the route he had plotted for himself ran before Bond’s eyes like a film while the automatic pilot that is in all good drivers took the car along the wide white highway beside the sleeping lake.

Bond followed his route of the afternoon. When he had turned off the main road he drove on his sidelights. He nosed the car off the lane into a clearing in the woods and switched off the engine. He sat and listened. In the heavy silence there was only a soft ticking from the hot metal under the bonnet and the hasty trip of the dashboard clock. Bond got out, eased the door shut and walked softly down the little path through the trees.

Now he could hear the soft heavy pant of the generator engine… thumpah… thumpah… thumpah. It seemed a watchful, rather threatening noise. Bond reached the gap in the iron bars, slipped through and stood, straining his senses forward through the moon-dappled trees.

THUMPAH… THUMPAH… THUMPAH. The great iron puffs were on top of him, inside his brain. Bond felt the skin-crawling tickle at the groin that dates from one’s first game of hide and seek in the dark. He smiled to himself at the animal danger signal. What primeval chord had been struck by this innocent noise coming out of the tall zinc chimney? The breath of a dinosaur in its cave? Bond tightened his muscles and crept forward foot by foot, moving small branches carefully out of his way, placing each step as cautiously as if he was going through a minefield.

The trees were thinning. Soon he would be up with the big sheltering trunk he had used before. He looked for it and then stood frozen, his pulse racing. Below the trunk of his tree, spreadeagled on the ground, was a body.

Bond opened his mouth wide and breathed slowly in and out to release the tension. Softly he wiped his sweating palms down his trousers. He dropped slowly to his hands and knees and stared forward, his eyes widened like camera lenses.

The body under the tree moved, shifted cautiously to a new position. A breath of wind whispered in the tops of the trees. The moonbeams danced quickly across the body and then were still. There was a glimpse of thick black hair, black sweater, narrow black slacks. And something else—a straight gleam of metal along the ground. It began beneath the clump of black hair and ran past the trunk of the trees into the grass.

Bond slowly, wearily bent his head and looked at the ground between his spread hands. It was the girl, Tilly. She was watching the buildings below. She had a rifle—a rifle that must have been among the innocent golf clubs—ready to fire on them. Damn and blast the silly bitch！

Bond slowly relaxed. It didn’t matter who she was or what she was up to. He measured the distance, planned each stride—the trajectory of the final spring, left hand to her neck, right to the gun. Now！

Bond’s chest skidded over the hump of the buttocks and thudded into the small of the girl’s back. The impact emptied the breath out of her with a soft grunt. The fingers of Bond’s left hand flew to the throat and found the carotid artery. His right hand was on the waist of the rifle’s stock. He prised the fingers away, felt that the safety catch was on and reached the rifle far to one side.

Bond eased the weight of his chest off the girl’s back and moved his fingers away from her neck. He closed them softly over her mouth. Beneath him, he felt the body heave, the lungs labouring for breath. She was still out. Carefully Bond gathered the two hands behind the girl’s back and held them with his right. Beneath him the buttocks began to squirm. The legs jerked. Bond pinned the legs to the ground with his stomach and thighs, noting the strong muscles bunched under him. Now the breath was rasping through his fingers. Teeth gnawed at his hand. Bond inched carefully forwards along the girl. He got his mouth through her hair to her ear. He whispered urgently, “Tilly, for Christ’s sake. Stay still！This is me, Bond. I’m a friend. This is vital. Something you don’t know about. Will you stay still and listen?”

The teeth stopped reaching for his fingers. The body relaxed and lay soft under his. After a time, the head nodded once.

Bond slid off her. He lay beside her, still holding her hands prisoned behind her back.

He whispered, “Get your breath. But tell me, were you after Goldfinger?”

The pale face glanced sideways and away. The girl whispered fiercely into the ground, “I was going to kill him.”

Some girl Goldfinger had put in the family way. Bond let go her hands. She brought them up and rested her head on them. Her whole body shuddered with exhaustion and released nerves. The shoulders began to shake softly. Bond reached out a hand and smoothed her hair, quietly, rhythmically. His eyes carefully went over the peaceful, unchanged scene below. Unchanged? There was something. The radar thing on the cowl of the chimney. It wasn’t going round any more. It had stopped with its oblong mouth pointing in their direction. The fact had no significance for Bond. Now the girl wasn’t crying any more. Bond nuzzled his mouth close to her ear. Her hair smelled of jasmine. He whispered, “don’t worry. I’m after him too. And I’m going to damage him far worse than you could have done. I’ve been sent after him by London. They want him. What did he do to you?”

She whispered, almost to herself, “He killed my sister. You knew her—Jill Masterton.”

Bond said fiercely, “What happened?”

“He has a woman once a month. Jill told me this when she first took the job. He hypnotizes them. Then he—he paints them gold.”

“Christ！Why?”

“I don’t know. Jill told me he’s mad about gold. I suppose he sort of thinks he’s—that he’s sort of possessing gold. You know—marrying it. He gets some Korean servant to paint them. The man has to leave their backbones unpainted. Jill couldn’t explain that. I found out it’s so they wouldn’t die. If their bodies were completely covered with gold paint, the pores of the skin wouldn’t be able to breathe. Then they'd die. Afterwards, they’re washed down by the Korean with resin or something. Goldfinger gives them a thousand dollars and sends them away.

Bond saw the dreadful Oddjob with his pot of gold paint, Goldfinger’s eyes gloating over the glistening statue, the fierce possession. “What happened to Jill?”

“She cabled me to come. She was in an emergency ward in a hospital in Miami. Goldfinger had thrown her out. She was dying. The doctors didn’t know what was the matter. She told me what had happened to her—what he had done to her. She died the same night.”The girl’s voice was dry—matter of fact. “When I got back to England I went to Train, the skin specialist. He told me this business about the pores of the skin. It had happened to some cabaret girl who had to pose as a silver statue. He showed me details of the case and the autopsy. Then I knew what had happened to Jill. Goldfinger had had her painted all over. He had murdered her. It must have been out of revenge for—for going with you.”There was a pause. The girl said dully, “She told me about you. She—she liked you. She told me if ever I met you I was to give you this ring.”

Bond closed his eyes tight, fighting with a wave of mental nausea. More death！More blood on his hands. This time, as the result of a careless gesture, a piece of bravado that had led to twenty-four hours of ecstasy with a beautiful girl who had taken his fancy and, in the end, rather more than his fancy. And this petty sideswipe at Goldfinger’s ego had been returned by Goldfinger a thousand, a millionfold. “She left my employ,”the flat words in the sunshine at Sandwich two days before. How Goldfinger must have enjoyed saying that！Bond’s fingernails dug into the palms of his hands. By God, he’d pin this murder on Goldfinger if it was the last act of his life. As for himself…? Bond knew the answer. This death he would not be able to excuse as being part of his job. This death he would have to live with.

The girl was pulling at her finger—at the Claddagh ring, the entwined hands round the gold heart. She put her knuckle to her mouth. The ring came off. She held it up for Bond to take. The tiny gold circle, silhouetted against the trunk of the tree, glittered in the moonlight.

The noise in Bond’s ear was something between a hiss and a shrill whistle. There was a dry, twanging thud. The aluminium feathers of the steel arrow trembled like a humming bird’s wings in front of Bond’s eyes. The shaft of the arrow straightened. The gold ring tinkled down the shaft until it reached the bark of the tree.

Slowly, almost incuriously, Bond turned his head.

Ten yards away—half in moonlight, half in shadow—the black melon-headed figure crouched, its legs widely straddled in the judo stance. The left arm, thrust forward against the glinting semicircle of the bow, was straight as a duellist’s. The right hand, holding the feathers of the second arrow, was rigid against the right cheek. Behind the head, the taut right elbow lanced back in frozen suspense. The silver tip of the second arrow pointed exactly between the two pale raised profiles.

Bond breathed the words, “Don’t move an inch.”Aloud he said, “Hullo, Oddjob. Damned good shot.”

Oddjob jerked the tip of the arrow upwards.

Bond got to his feet, shielding the girl. He said softly, out of the corner of his mouth, “He mustn’t see the rifle.”He said to Oddjob, speaking casually, peaceably, “Nice place Mr Goldfinger has here. Want to have a word with him sometime. Perhaps it’s a bit late tonight. You might tell him I’ll be along tomorrow.”Bond said to the girl, “Come on, darling. We’ve had our walk in the woods. Time to get back to the hotel.”He took a step away from Oddjob towards the fence.

Oddjob stamped his forward foot. The point of the second arrow swung to the centre of Bond’s stomach.

“Oargn.”Oddjob jerked his head sideways and downwards towards the house.

“Oh, you think he’d like to see us now? All right. You don’t think we’ll be disturbing him? Come on, darling.”

Bond led the way to the left of the tree, away from the rifle that lay in the shadowed grass.

As they went slowly down the hill, Bond talked softly to the girl, briefing her. “You’re my girl friend. I brought you out from England. Seem surprised and interested by our little adventure. We’re in a tough spot. Don’t try any tricks.”Bond jerked back his head. “This man’s a killer.”

The girl said angrily, “If only you hadn’t interfered.”

“Same to you,”said Bond shortly. He took it back. “I’m sorry, Tilly. Didn’t mean that. But I don’t think you could have got away with it.”

“I had my plans. I’d have been over the frontier by midnight.”

Bond didn’t answer. Something had caught his eye. On top of the tall chimney, the oblong mouth of the radar—thing was revolving again. It was that that had spotted them—heard them. It must be some kind of sonic detector. What a bag of tricks this man was！Bond hadn’t meant to underestimate Goldfinger. Had he managed to do so—decisively? Perhaps, if he had had his gun…? No. Bond knew that even his split-second draw wouldn’t have beaten the Korean—wouldn’t do so now. There was a total deadliness about this man. Whether Bond had been armed or unarmed, it would have been a man fighting a tank.

They reached the courtyard. As they did so, the back door of the house opened. Two more Koreans, who might have been the servants from Reculver, ran out towards them through the warm splash of electric light. They carried ugly-looking polished sticks. “Stop！”Both men wore the savage, empty grin that men from Station J, who had been in Japanese prison camps, had described to Bond. “We search. No trouble or…”The man who had spoken, cut the air with a whistling lash of his stick. “Hands up！”

Bond put his hands slowly up. He said to the girl, “Don’t react… whatever they do.”

Odd job came forward and stood, menacingly, watching the search. The search was expert. Bond coldly watched the hands on the girl, the grinning faces.

“Okay. Come！”

They were herded through the open door and along a stone-flagged passage to the narrow entrance hall at the front of the house. The house smelled as Bond had imagined it would musty and fragrant and summery. There were white-panelled doors. Oddjob knocked on one of them.

“Yes?”Oddjob opened the door. They were prodded through.

Goldfinger sat at a big desk. It was neatly encumbered with important-looking papers.

The desk was flanked by grey metal filing cabinets. Beside the desk, within reach of Goldfinger’s hand, stood a short-wave wireless set on a low table. There was an operator’s keyboard and a machine that ticked busily and looked like a barograph. Bond guessed that this had something to do with the detector that had intercepted them.

Goldfinger wore his purple velvet smoking-jacket over an open-necked white silk shirt. The open neck showed a tuft of orange chest-hair. He sat very erect in a high-backed chair. He hardly glanced at the girl. The big china-blue eyes were fixed on Bond. They showed no surprise. They held no expression except a piercing hardness.

Bond blustered, “Look here, Goldfinger. What the hell’s all this about? You put the police on to me over that ten thousand dollars and I got on your tracks with my girl friend here, Miss Soames. I’ve come to find out what the hell you mean by it. We climbed the fence—I know it’s trespassing, but I wanted to catch you before you moved on somewhere else. Then this ape of yours came along and damned near killed one of us with his bow and arrow. Two more of your bloody Koreans held us up and searched us. What the hell’s going on? If you can’t give me a civil answer and full apologies I’ll put the police on you.”

Goldfinger’s flat, hard stare didn’t flicker. He might not have heard Bond’s angrygentleman’s outburst. The finely chiselled lips parted. He said, “Mr Bond, they have a saying in Chicago, “Once is happenstance. Twice is coincidence. The third time it’s enemy action.”Miami, Sandwich and now Geneva. I propose to wring the truth out of you.”Goldfinger’s eyes slid slowly past Bond’s head. “Oddjob. The Pressure Room.”





PART THREE：ENEMY ACTION





CHAPTER FIFTEEN THE PRESSURE ROOM


BOND’S REACTION was automatic. There was no reason behind it. He took one quick step forward and hurled himself across the desk at Goldfinger. His body, launched in a shallow dive, hit the top of the desk and ploughed through the litter of papers. There was a heavy thud as the top of his head crashed into Goldfinger’s breastbone. The momentum of the blow rocked Goldfinger in his chair. Bond kicked back at the edge of the desk, got a purchase and rammed forward again. As the chair toppled backwards and the two bodies went down in the splintering woodwork, Bond’s fingers got to the throat and his thumbs went into its base and downwards with every ounce of his force.

Then the whole house fell on Bond, a baulk of timber hit him at the base of the neck and he rolled sluggishly off Goldfinger on to the floor and lay still.

The vortex of light through which Bond was whirling slowly flattened into a disc, a yellow moon, and then into a burning Cyclops eye. Something was written round the fiery eyeball. It was a message, an important message for him. He must read it. Carefully, one by one, Bond spelled out the tiny letters. The message said：SOCIÉTÉ ANONYME MAZDA. What was its significance? A hard bolt of water hit Bond in the face. The water stung his eyes and filled his mouth. He retched desperately and tried to move. He couldn’t. His eyes cleared, and his brain. There was a throbbing pain at the back of his neck. He was staring up into a big enamelled light bowl with one powerful bulb. He was on some sort of a table and his wrists and ankles were bound to its edges. He felt with his fingers. He felt polished metal.

A voice, Goldfinger’s voice, flat, uninterested, said, “Now we can begin.”

Bond turned his head towards the voice. His eyes were dazzled by the light. He squeezed them hard and opened them. Goldfinger was sitting in a canvas chair. He had taken off his jacket and was in his shirt sleeves. There were red marks round the base of his throat. On a folding table beside him were various tools and metal instruments and a control panel. On the other side of the table Tilly Masterton sat in another chair. She was strapped to it by her wrists and ankles. She sat bolt upright as if she was in school. She looked incredibly beautiful, but shocked, remote. Her eyes gazed vacantly at Bond. She was either drugged or hypnotized.

Bond turned his head to the right. A few feet away stood the Korean. He still wore his bowler hat but now he was stripped to the waist. The yellow skin of his huge torso glinted with sweat. There was no hair on it. The flat pectoral muscles were as broad as dinner plates and the stomach was concave below the great arch of the ribs. The biceps and forearms, also hairless, were as thick as thighs. The ten-minutes-to-two oil slicks of the eyes looked pleased, greedy. The mouthful of blackish teeth formed an oblong grin of anticipation.

Bond raised his head. The quick look round hurt. They were in one of the factory workrooms. White light blazed round the iron doors of two electric furnaces. There were bluish sheets of metal stacked in wooden frames. From somewhere came the whir of a generator. There was a distant, muffled sound of hammering, and, behind the sound, the faraway iron pant of the power plant.

Bond glanced down the table on which he lay spread-eagled. He let his head fall back with a sigh. There was a narrow slit down the centre of the polished steel table. At the far end of the slit, like a foresight framed in the vee of his parted feet, were the glinting teeth of a circular saw.

Bond lay and stared up at the little message on the lamp bulb. Goldfinger began to speak in a relaxed conversational voice. Bond pulled the curtains tight across the ghastly peepshow of his imagination and listened.

“Mr Bond, the word ‘pain’ comes from the Latin poena meaning ‘penalty’—that which must be paid. You must now pay for the inquisitiveness which your attack upon me proves, as I suspected, to be inimical. Curiosity, as they say, killed the cat. This time it will have to kill two cats, for I fear I must also count this girl an enemy. She tells me she is staying at the Bergues. One telephone call proved that to be false. Oddjob was sent to where you were both hidden and recovered her rifle and also a ring which it happens that I recognize. Under hypnotism the rest came out. This girl came here to kill me. Perhaps you did too. You have both failed. Now must come the poena. Mr Bond,” the voice was weary, bored—“I have had many enemies in my time. I am very successful and immensely rich, and riches, if I may inflict another of my aphorisms upon you, may not make you friends but they greatly increase the class and variety of your enemies.”

“That’s very neatly put.”

Goldfinger ignored the interruption. “If you were a free man, with your talent for inquiry, you would be able to find round the world the relics of those who have wished me ill, or who have tried to thwart me. There have, as I said, been many of these people and you would find, Mr Bond, that their remains resemble those of hedgehogs squashed upon the roads in summertime.”

“Very poetic simile.”

“By chance, Mr Bond. I am a poet in deeds—not often in words. I am Concerned to arrange my actions in appropriate and effective patterns. But that is by the way. I wish to convey to you that it was a most evil day for you when you first crossed my path and, admittedly in a very minor fashion, thwarted a minuscule project upon which I was engaged. On that occasion it was someone else who suffered the poena that should have been meted out to you. An eye was taken for the eye, but it was not yours. You were lucky and, if you had then found an oracle to consult, the oracle would have said to you, ‘Mr Bond, you have been fortunate. Keep away from Mr Auric Goldfinger. He is a most powerful man. If Mr Goldfinger wanted to crush you, he would only have to turn over in his sleep to do so.’”

“You express yourself most vividly.”Bond turned his head. The great brown and orange football of a head was bent slightly forward. The round moon-face was bland, indifferent. Casually, one hand reached out to the control panel and pressed down a switch. There came a slow metallic growl from the end of the table on which Bond lay. It curved quickly up to a harsh whine and then to a shrill high whistle that was barely audible. Bond turned his head wearily away. How soon could he manage to die? Was there any way he could hasten death? A friend of his had survived the Gestapo. He had described to Bond how he had tried to commit suicide by holding his breath. By superhuman will-power, after a few minutes without breathing, unconsciousness had come. But, with the blackout of the senses, will and intention had also left the body. At once reason was forgotten. The body’s instinct to live manned the pumps and got breath back into the body again. But Bond could try it. There was nothing else to help him through the pain barrier before the blessing of death. For death was the only exit. He knew he could never squeal to Goldfinger and live with himself again—even in the unlikely event that Goldfinger could be bought off with the truth. No, he must stick to his thin story and hope that the others who would now follow him on Goldfinger’s trail would have better luck. Who would M choose? Probably 008, the second killer in the small section of three. He was a good man, more careful than Bond. M would know that Goldfinger had killed Bond and he would give 008 licence to kill in return. 258 in Geneva would put him on to the scent that would end with Bond’s inquiry about the Entre-prises Auric. Yes, fate would catch up with Goldfinger if Bond could only keep his mouth shut. If he gave the least clue away, Goldfinger would escape. That was unthinkable.

“Now then, Mr Bond,”Goldfinger’s voice was brisk. “Enough of these amiabilities. Sing, as my Chicago friends put it, and you will die quickly and painlessly. The girl also. Sing not, and your death will be one long scream. The girl I shall then give to Oddjob, as I did that cat, for supper. Which is it to be?”

Bond said, “Don’t be a fool, Goldfinger. I told my friends at Universal where I was going and why. The girl’s parents know that she went with me. I made inquiries about this factory of yours before we came here. We shall be traced here very easily. Universal is powerful. You will have the police after you within days of our disappearance. I will make a deal with you. Let us go and nothing more will be heard of the matter. I will vouch for the girl. You are making a stupid mistake. We are two perfectly innocent people.”

Goldfinger said in a bored voice, “I’m afraid you don’t understand, Mr Bond. Whatever you have managed to find out about me, which I suspect is very little, can only be a grain of the truth. I am engaged upon gigantic enterprises. To take the gamble of letting either of you leave here alive would be quite ludicrous. It is out of the question. As for my being bothered by the police, I shall be delighted to receive them if they come. Those of my Koreans who can speak won’t do so—nor will the mouths of my electric furnaces which will have vaporized you both and all your belongings at two thousand degrees Centigrade. No, Mr Bond, make your choice. Perhaps I can encourage you”—there came the noise of a lever moving across iron teeth. “The saw is now approaching your body at about an inch every minute. Meanwhile,”he glanced at Odd job and held up one finger, “a little massage from Oddjob. To begin with, only grade one. Grades two and three are still more persuasive.”

Bond closed his eyes. The sickly zoo-smell of Oddjob enveloped him. Big, rasping fingers set to work on him carefully, delicately. A pressure here, combined with a pressure there, a sudden squeeze, a pause, and then a quick, sharp blow. Always the hard hands were surgically accurate. Bond ground his teeth until he thought they would break. The sweat of pain began to form pools in the sockets of his closed eyes. The shrill whine of the saw was getting louder. It reminded Bond of the sawdust-scented sounds of long ago summer evenings at home in England. Home? This was his home, this cocoon of danger he had chosen to live in. And here he would be buried ‘in some corner of a foreign blast furnace that is for ever two thousand degrees Centigrade’. God rest ye merry gentlemen of the Secret Service！What should he give himself as an epitaph? What should be his ‘famous last words’? That you have no choice about your birth, but you can choose the way you die? Yes, it would look well on a tombstone—not Savoir vivre but Savoir mourir.

“Mr Bond.”Goldfinger’s voice held an ounce of urgency. “Is this really necessary? Just tell me the truth. Who are you? Who sent you here? What do you know? Then it will be so easy. You shall both have a pill. There will be no pain. It will be like taking a sleeping draught.

Otherwise it will be so messy—so messy and distressing. And are you being fair to the girl? Is this the behaviour of an English gentleman?”

Oddjob’s torment had stopped. Bond turned his head slowly towards the voice and opened his eyes. He said, “Goldfinger, there is nothing more to tell because there is nothing. If you will not accept my first bargain I will make you another. The girl and I will work for you. How about that? We are capable people. You could put us to good use.”

“And get a knife, two knives in my back? Thank you no, Mr Bond.”

Bond decided it was time to stop talking. It was time to start winding up the mainspring of will-power that must not run down again until he was dead. Bond said politely, “Then you can go and—yourself.”He expelled all the breath from his lungs and closed his eyes.

“Even I am not capable of that, Mr Bond,”said Goldfinger with good humour. “And now, since you have chosen the stony path instead of the smooth, I must extract what interest I can from your predicament by making the path as stony as possible. Oddjob, grade two.”

The lever on the table moved across iron teeth. Now Bond could feel the wind of the saw between his knees. The hands came back.

Bond counted the slowly pounding pulse that utterly possessed his body. It was like the huge panting power plant in the other part of the factory but, in his case, it was slowly decelerating. If only it would slow down quicker. What was this ridiculous will to live that refused to listen to the brain? Who was making the engine run on although the tank was dry of fuel? But he must empty his mind of thought, as well as his body of oxygen. He must become a vacuum, a deep hole of unconsciousness.

Still the light burned red through his eyelids. Still he could feel the bursting pressure in his temples. Still the slow drum of life beat in his ears.

A scream tried to force its way through the clamped teeth.

Die damn you die die damn you die damn you die damn you die damn you die…





CHAPTER SIXTEEN THE LAST AND THE BIGGEST


THE WINGS of a dove, the heavenly choir, Hark the Herald Angels Sing—what else ought he to remember about Paradise? It was all so exactly like what he had been told in the nursery—this sensation of flying, the darkness, the drone of the million harps. He really must try and remember the dope about the place. Let’s see now, one got to the Pearly Gates…

A deep fatherly voice said, almost in his ear, “This is your captain speaking.”(Well, well.Who was this. Saint Peter?) 'We are coming in to land now. Will you please fasten your seat belts and extinguish your cigarettes. Thank you.”

There must be a whole lot of them, going up together. Would Tilly be on the same trip? Bond squirmed with embarrassment. How would he introduce her to the others, to Vesper for instance? And when it came to the point, which would he like the best? But perhaps it would be a big place with countries and towns. There was probably no more reason why he should run into one of his former girl friends here than there had been on earth. But still there were a lot of people he’d better avoid until he got settled in and found out the form. Perhaps, with so much love about, these things wouldn’t matter. Perhaps one just loved all the girls one met. Hm. Tricky business with these unworthy thoughts in his mind, Bond relapsed into unconsciousness.

The next tiling he knew was a gentle sensation of swaying. He opened his eyes. The sun blinded them. He closed them again. A voice above and behind his head said, “Watch it, bud. That ramp’s steeper than it looks.”Almost immediately there was a heavy jolt. A surly voice in front said, “Cheesus, you’re telling me. Why in hell can’t they put down rubber.”

Bond thought angrily, that’s a fine way to talk up here. Just because I’m new and they think no one’s listening.

There was the bang of a swing door. Something hit Bond sharply on a protruding elbow. He shouted “Hey！”and tried to reach his elbow and rub it, but his hands wouldn’t move.

“Whaddya know. Hey, Sam, better call the doc. This one’s come round.”

“Sure！Here, put him alongside the other.”Bond felt himself being lowered. It was cooler now. He opened his eyes. A big round Brooklyn face was bent over his. The eyes met his and smiled. The metal supports of the stretcher touched the ground. The man said, “How ya feeling’, mister?”

“Where am I?”Now there was panic in Bond’s voice. He tried to rise but couldn’t. He felt the sweat break out on his body. God！Was this still part of the old life? At the thought of it, a wave of grief poured through his body. Tears burned his eyes and trickled down his cheeks.

“Hey, hey！Take it easy, mister. You’re okay. This is Idlewild, New York. You’re in America now. No more troubles, see.”The man straightened up. He thought Bond was a refugee from somewhere. “Sam, get movin. This guy’s in shock.”

“Okay, okay.”The two voices receded, mumbling anxiously.

Bond found he could move his head. He looked round. He was in a white-painted ward—presumably something to do with the health department of the airport. There was a row of tidy beds. Sun poured down from high windows, but it was cool, air-conditioned. He was on a stretcher on the floor. There was another one next to it. He strained his head sideways. It was Tilly. She was unconscious. Her pale face, framed in black hair, pointed at the ceiling.

The door at the end of the ward sighed open. A doctor in a white coat stood and held it. Goldfinger, looking brisk, cheerful, walked swiftly down between the beds. He was followed by Oddjob. Bond wearily closed his eyes. Christ！So that was the score.

Feet gathered round his stretcher. Goldfinger said breezily, “Well, they certainly look in good shape, eh, Doctor? That’s one of the blessings of having enough money. When one’s friends or one’s staff are ill one can get them the very best medical attention. Nervous breakdowns, both of them. And in the same week！Would you believe it? But I blame myself for working them both too hard. Now it’s my duty to get them back on their feet again. Dr Foch—he’s the best man in Geneva, by the way—was quite definite. He said, “They need rest, Mr Goldfinger. Rest, rest and again rest.”He gave them sedatives and now they’re on their way to the Harkness Pavilion at the Presbyterian.”Goldfinger chuckled fatly. “Sow and you shall reap, eh, Doctor? When I gave the Harkness a million dollars’ worth of X-ray equipment, I certainly never expected anything back. But now? I only had to put through a call and they've got two fine rooms waiting for them. Now then,”there was a rustle of notes, “thank you for all your help with Immigration. Fortunately they both had valid visas and I think Immigration was satisfied that Mr Auric Goldfinger was a sufficient guarantee that neither of them wants to overthrow the United States Government by force, what?”

“Yes indeed, and thank you Mr Goldfinger. Anything I can do… I understand you have a private ambulance waiting outside.”

Bond opened his eyes and looked at where the doctor’s voice came from. He saw a pleasant, serious young man with rimless glasses and a crew-cut. Bond said quietly and with desperate sincerity, “Doctor, there is absolutely nothing wrong with me or this girl. We have been drugged and brought here against our will. Neither of us works or has ever worked for Goldfinger. I am warning you that we have been kidnapped. I demand to see the Chief of Immigration. I have friends in Washington and New York. They will vouch for me. I beg of you to believe me.”Bond held the man’s eyes in his, willing him to believe; The doctor looked worried. He turned to Goldfinger. Goldfinger shook his head—discreetly so that Bond would not be insulted. A surreptitious hand went up and tapped the side of his head away from Bond. Goldfinger raised helpless eyebrows. “You see what I mean, Doctor? It’s been like this for days. Total nervous prostration combined with persecution mania. Dr Foch said they often go together. It may need weeks at the Harkness. But I’m going to pull him round if it’s the last thing I do. It’s the shock of these unfamiliar surroundings. Perhaps a shot of intraval sodium…”

The doctor bent to his black bag. “I guess you’re right, Mr Goldfinger. So long as Harkness is looking after the case.”There came the tinkle of instruments.

Goldfinger said, “It’s terribly sad to see a man break down so utterly, a man who has been one of my best assistants.”He bent a sweet, fatherly smile on Bond. There was a catch in his voice. “You’ll be all right, James. Just relax and have a nice sleep. I was afraid the flight might be too much for you. Just relax and leave everything to me.”.

Bond felt the swab on his arm. He heaved. Against his will, a shower of curses poured from his lips. Then he felt the needle and opened his mouth and screamed and screamed while the doctor knelt beside him and delicately, patiently, wiped away the sweat from his forehead.

Now it was a grey painted box of a room. There were no windows. Light came from a single lamp inset in the centre of the ceiling. Round the lamp were concentric slits in the plaster and there was the neutral smell and faint hum of air-conditioning. Bond found he could sit up. He did so. He felt drowsy but well. He suddenly realized that he was ravenously hungry and thirsty. When had he last had a meal? Two, three days ago? He put his feet down on the floor. He was naked. He examined his body. Oddjob had been careful. There was no sign of damage save for the group of needle-.marks on his right forearm. He got up, conquering dizziness, and took a few steps in the room. He had been lying on a ship’s type bunk with drawers under it. The only other furniture in the room was a plain deal table and an upright wooden chair. Everything was clean, functional, Spartan. Bond knelt to die drawers under the bunk and opened them. They contained all the contents of his suitcase except his watch and the gun. Even the rather heavy shoes he had been wearing on his expedition to Entreprises Auric were there. He twisted one of the heels and pulled. The broad double-sided knife slid smoothly out of its scabbard in the sole. With the fingers wrapped round the locked heel it made a workmanlike stabbing dagger. Bond verified that the other shoe held its knife and clicked the heels back into position. He pulled out：some clothes and put them on. He found his cigarette case and lighter and lit a cigarette. There were two doors of which one had a handle. He opened this one. It led into a small, well-appointed bathroom and lavatory. His washing and shaving things were neatly laid out. There were a girl’s things beside them. Bond softly opened the other door into the bathroom. It was a similar room to his own. Tilly Masterton’s black hair showed on the pillow of the bunk. Bond tiptoed over and looked down. She was sleeping peacefully, a half-smile on the beautiful mouth. Bond went back into the bathroom, softly closed the door and went to the mirror over the basin and looked at himself. The black stubble looked more like three days than two. He set to work to clean himself up.

Half an hour later. Bond was sitting on the edge of his bunk thinking, when the door without a handle opened abruptly. Oddjob stood in the entrance. He looked incuriously at Bond. His eyes nickered carefully round the room. Bond said sharply, “Oddjob, I want a lot of food, quickly. And a bottle of bourbon, soda and ice. Also a carton of Chesterfields, king-size, and either my own watch or another one as good as mine. Quick march！Chopchop！And tell Goldfinger I want to see him, but not until I’ve had something to eat. Come on！Jump to it！Don’t stand there looking inscrutable. I’m hungry.”

Oddjob looked redly at Bond as if wondering which piece to break. He opened his mouth, uttered a noise between an angry bark and a belch, spat drily on the floor at his feet and stepped back, whirling the door shut. When the slam should have come, the door decelerated abruptly and closed with a soft, decisive, double click.

The encounter put Bond in good humour. For some reason Goldfinger had decided against killing him. He wanted them alive. Soon Bond would know why he wanted them alive but, so long as he did, Bond intended to stay alive on his own terms. Those terms included putting Oddjob and any other Korean firmly in his place, which, in Bond’s estimation, was rather lower than apes in the mammalian hierarchy.

By the time an excellent meal together with everything else, including his watch, Bond had asked for, had been brought by one of the Korean servants, Bond had learned nothing more about his circumstances except that his room was close to water and not far from a railway bridge. Assuming his room was in New York, it was either on the Hudson or the East River. The railway was electric and sounded like a subway, but Bond’s New York geography was not good enough to place it. His watch had stopped. When he asked the time he got no answer.

Bond had eaten all the food on the tray and was smoking and sipping a solid bourbon and soda when the door opened. Goldfinger came in alone. He was wearing a regulation businessman’s clothes and looked relaxed and cheerful. He closed the door behind him and stood with his back to it. He looked searchingly at Bond. Bond smoked and looked politely back.

Goldfinger said, “Good morning, Mr Bond. I see you are yourself again. I hope you prefer being here to being dead. So as to save you the trouble of asking a lot of conventional questions, I will tell you where you are and what has happened to you. I will then put to you a proposition to which I require an unequivocal reply. You are a more reasonable man than most, so I need only give you one brief warning. Do not attempt any dramatics. Do not attack me with a knife or a fork or that bottle. If you do, I shall shoot you with this.”A small-calibre pistol grew like a black thumb out of Goldfinger’s right fist. He put the hand with the gun back in his pocket. “I very seldom use these things. When I have had to, I have never needed more than one—25 calibre bullet to kill. I shoot at the right eye, Mr Bond. And I never miss.”

Bond said, “Don’t worry, I’m not as accurate as that with a bourbon bottle.”He hitched up the knee of his trousers and put one leg across the other. He sat relaxed. “Go ahead.”

“Mr Bond,”Goldfinger’s voice was amiable. “I am an expert in many other materials beside metals and I have a keen appreciation of everything that is one thousand fine, as we say of the purest gold. In comparison with that degree of purity, of value, human material is of a very low grade indeed. But occasionally one comes across a piece of this stuff that can at least be put to the lower forms of use. Oddjob is an example of what I mean—simple, unrefined clay, capable of limited exploitation. At the last, moment my hand hesitated to destroy a utensil with the durability I observed in yourself. I may have made a mistake in staying my hand. In any case I shall take the fullest steps to protect myself from the consequences of my impulse. It was something you said that saved your life. You suggested that you and Miss Masterton would work for me. Normally I would have no use for either of you, but it just happens that I am on the brink of a certain enterprise in which the services of both of you could be of a certain minimal assistance. So I took the gamble. I gave you both the necessary sedatives. Your bills were paid and your things fetched from the Bergues where Miss Masterton turned out to be registered under her real name. I sent a cable in your name to Universal Export. You had been offered employment in Canada. You were flying over to explore the prospects. You were taking Miss Masterton as your secretary. You would write further details. A clumsy cable, but it will serve for the short period I require your services. (It won’t, thought Bond, unless you included in the text one of the innocent phrases that would tell M that the cable was authentic. By now, the Service would know he was working under enemy control. Wheels would be turning very fast indeed.) And in case you think, Mr Bond, that my precautions were inadequate, that you will be traced, let me tell you that I am no longer in the least interested about your true identity nor the strength and resources of your employers. You and Miss Masterton have utterly disappeared, Mr Bond. So have I, so have all my staff. The airport will refer inquiries to the Harkness Pavilion at the Presbyterian Hospital. The hospital will never have heard of Mr Goldfinger nor of his patients. The FBI and the CIA have no record of me, for I have no criminal history. No doubt the immigration authorities will have details of my comings and goings over the years, but these will not be helpful. As for my present whereabouts, and yours, Mr Bond, we are now in the warehouse of the Hi-speed Trucking Corporation, a formerly respectable concern which I own through nominees and which has been equipped, most thoroughly, as the secret headquarters for the enterprise of which I spoke. You and Miss Masterton will be confined to these quarters. Here you will live and work and possibly, though personally I have doubts about Miss Masterton’s inclinations in that respect, make love.”

“And what will our work consist of?”

“Mr Bond—”For the first time since Bond had known Goldfinger, the big, bland face, always empty of expression, showed a trace of life. A look almost of rapture illuminated the eyes. The finely chiselled lips pursed into a thin, beatic curve. “Mr Bond, all my life I have been in love. I have been in love with gold. I love its colour, its brilliance, its divine heaviness. I love the texture of gold, that soft sliminess that I have learnt to gauge so accurately by touch that I can estimate the fineness of a bar to within one carat. And I love the warm tang it exudes when I melt it down into a true golden syrup. But, above all, Mr Bond, I love the power that gold alone gives to its owner—the magic of controlling energy, exacting labour, fulfilling one’s every wish and whim and, when need be, purchasing bodies, minds, even souls. Yes, Mr Bond, I have worked all my life for gold and, in return, gold has worked for me and for those enterprises that I have espoused. I ask you,”Goldfinger gazed earnestly at Bond, “is there any other substance on earth that so rewards its owner?”

“Many people have become rich and powerful without possessing an ounce of the stuff. But I see your point. How much have you managed to collect and what do you do with it?”

“I own about twenty million pounds’ worth, about as much as a small country. It is now all in New York. I keep it where I need it. My treasure of gold is like a compost heap. I move it here and there over the face of the earth and, wherever I choose to spread it, that corner blossoms and blooms. I reap the harvest and move on. At this moment I am proposing to encourage, to force, a certain American enterprise with my golden compost.Therefore the gold bars are in New York.”

“How do you choose these enterprises? What attracts you to them?”

“I espouse any enterprise that will increase my stock of gold. I invest, I smuggle, I steal.”Goldfinger made a small gesture of the hands, opening the palms persuasively. “If you will follow the simile, regard history as a train speeding along through time. Birds and animals are disturbed by the noise and tumult of the train’s passage, they fly away from it or run fearfully or cower, thinking they hide. I am like the hawk that follows the train—you have no doubt seen them doing this, in Greece for instance—ready to pounce on anything that may be flushed by the train’s passage, by the passage of history. To give you a simple example：the progress of history produces a man who invents penicillin. At the same time, history creates a world war. Many people are dying or afraid of dying. Penicillin will save them. Through bribery at certain military establishments on the Continent, I obtain stocks of penicillin. I water these down with some harmless powder or liquid and sell them at immense profit to those who crave the stuff. You see what I mean, Mr Bond? You have to wait for the prey, watch it carefully and then pounce. But, as I say, I do not search out such enterprises. I follow the train of history to flush them towards me.”

“What’s the latest one? What have Miss Masterton and I got to do with it?”

“The latest one Mr Bond, is the last one. It is also the biggest.”Goldfinger’s eyes were now blank, focused inwards. His voice became low, almost reverential at what he saw. “Man has climbed Everest and he has scraped the depths of the ocean. He has fired rockets into outer space and split the atom. He has invented, devised, created in every realm of human endeavour, and everywhere he has triumphed, broken records, achieved miracles. I said in every realm, but there is one that has been neglected, Mr Bond. That one is the human activity loosely known as crime. The so-called criminal exploits committed by individual humans—I do not of course refer to their idiotic wars, their clumsy destruction of each other—are of miserable dimensions：little bank robberies, tiny swindles, picayune forgeries. And yet, ready to hand, a few hundred miles from here, opportunity for the greatest crime in history stands waiting. The stage is set, the gigantic prize is offered. Only the actors are missing. But the producer is at last here, Mr Bond” Goldfinger raised a finger and tapped his chest—'and he has chosen his cast. This very afternoon the script will be read to the leading actors. Then rehearsals will begin and, in one week, the curtain will go up for the single, the unique performance. And then will come the applause, the applause for the greatest extra-legal coup of all time. And, Mr Bond, the world will rock with that applause for centuries.”

Now a dull fire burned in Goldfinger’s big pale eyes and there was a touch of extra colour in his red-brown cheeks. But it was still calm, relaxed, profoundly convinced. There’s no trace here, reflected Bond, of the madman, the visionary. Goldfinger had some fantastic exploit in mind, but he had gauged the odds and knew they were right. Bond said, “Well, come on. What is it, and what do we have to do about it?”

“It is a robbery, Mr Bond. A robbery against no opposition, but one that will need detailed execution. There will be much paper-work, many administrative details to supervise. I was going to do this myself until you offered your services. Now you will do it, with Miss Masterton as your secretary. You have already been partly remunerated for this work with your life. When the operation is successfully completed you will receive one million pounds in gold. Miss Masterton will receive half a million.”Bond said enthusiastically, “Now you’re talking. What are we going to do? Rob the end of the rainbow?”

“Yes,”Goldfinger nodded. “That is exactly what we are going to do. We are going to burgle fifteen billion dollars’ worth of gold bullion, approximately half the supply of mined gold in the world. We are going, Mr Bond, to take Fort Rnox.”





CHAPTER SEVENTEEN HOODS’ CONGRESS


“FORT KNOX.”Bond shook his head seriously. “Isn’t that rather a tall order for two men and a girl?”

Goldfinger shrugged impatiently. “Please put away your sense of humour for one week, Mr Bond. Then laugh as much as you please. I shall have under my command approximately one hundred men and women. These people will be hand picked from the six most powerful gangster groups in the United States. This force will amount to the toughest and most compact fighting unit that has ever been assembled in peace time.”

“All right. How many men guard the vault at Fort Knox?”Goldfinger slowly shook his head. He knocked once on the door behind him. The door flicked open. Oddjob stood on the threshold, crouching, alert. When he saw that the meeting was still peaceful he straightened himself and waited. Goldfinger said, “You will have many questions to ask, Mr Bond. They will all be answered this afternoon. Beginning at two-thirty. It is now exactly twelve o’clock.”Bond glanced at his watch and adjusted it. “You and Miss Masterton will attend the meeting at which the proposition will be put to the heads of the six organizations I have mentioned. No doubt these people will ask the same questions as occur to you. Everything will be explained. Afterwards you will settle down to detailed work with Miss Masterton. Ask for what you want. Oddjob will see to your welfare and also be on permanent guard. Do not be obstreperous or you will in stantly be killed. And do not waste time trying to escape or to contact the outside world. I have hired your services and I shall require every ounce of them. Is that a bargain?”

Bond said drily, “I’ve always wanted to be a millionaire.”

Goldfinger didn’t look at him. He looked at his fingernails. Then he gave Bond one last hard glance and went out and shut the door behind him.

Bond sat and gazed at the closed door. He brusquely ran both hands through his hair and down over his face. He said 'Well, well' aloud to the empty room, got up and walked through the bathroom to the girl’s bedroom. He knocked on the door.

“Who is it?”

“Me. Are you visible?”

“Yes.”The voice was unenthusiastic. “Come in.”

She was sitting on the edge of the bed, pulling on a shoe. She was wearing the things Bond had first seen her in. She looked cool and collected and unsurprised by her surroundings. She looked up at Bond. Her eyes were aloof, disdainful. She said coldly, precisely, “You’ve got us into this. Get us out.”

Bond said amiably, “I may be able to. I got us out of our graves.”

“After getting us into them.”

Bond looked thoughtfully at the girl. He decided it would be ungallant to spank her, so to speak, on an empty stomach. He said, “This won’t get us anywhere. We're in this together, whether we like it or not. What do you want for breakfast or lunch? It’s a quarter past twelve. I’ve eaten. I’ll order yours and then come back and tell you the score. There’s only one way out of here and Oddjob, that Korean ape, is guarding it. Now then, breakfast or lunch?”She unbent an inch. “Thank you. Scrambled eggs and coffee, please. And toast and marmalade.”

“Cigarettes?”

“No, thank you. I don’t smoke.”

Bond went back to his room and knocked on the door. It opened an inch.

Bond said, “All right, Oddjob. I’m not going to kill you yet.”

The door opened farther. Oddjob’s face was impassive. Bond gave the order. The door closed. Bond poured himself a bourbon and soda. He sat on the edge of the bed and wondered how he was going to get the girl on his side. From the beginning she had resented him. Was that only because of her sister? Why had Goldfinger made that cryptic remark about her “inclinations”? What was there about her that he himself felt—something withdrawn, inimical. She was beautiful—physically desirable. But there was a cold, hard centre to her that Bond couldn’t understand or define. Oh well, the main thing was to get her to go along. Otherwise life in prison would be intolerable.

Bond went back into her room. He left both doors open so that he could hear. She was still sitting on the bed wrapped in a coiled immobility. She watched Bond carefully. Bond leaned against the jamb of the door. He took a long pull at his whisky. He said, looking her in the eye, “You’d better know that I’m from Scotland Yard,”the euphemism would serve. “We’re after this man Goldfinger. He doesn’t mind. He thinks no one can find us for at least a week. He’s probably right. He saved our lives because he wants us to work for him on a crime. It’s big business. Pretty scatter-brained. But there’s a lot of planning and paperwork. We’ve got to look after that side. Can you do shorthand and typing?”

“Yes.”Her eyes were alight. “What’s the crime?”

Bond told her. He said, “Of course it all sounds ridiculous and I daresay a few questions and answers will show these gangsters, if they don’t show Goldfinger, that the whole thing’s impossible. But I don’t know. Goldfinger’s an extraordinary man. From what I know about him, he never moves unless the odds are right. And I don’t think he’s mad—at least not madder than other kinds of geniuses—scientists and so on. And there’s no doubt he’s a genius in his particular field.”

“So what are you going to do about it?”

Bond lowered his voice. He said, “What are we going to do about it, you mean. We are going to play along. And to the hilt. No shirking and no funny business. We’re going to be greedy for the money and we’re going to give him absolutely top-notch service. Apart from saving our lives, which mean less than nothing to him, it’s the only hope we, or rather I because that’s my line of country, can have of a chance to queer his pitch.”

“How are you going to do that?”

“I haven’t the faintest idea. Something may turn up.”

“And you expect me to go along with you?”

“Why not? Any other suggestions?”

She pursed her lips obstinately.

“Why should I do what you say?”

Bond sighed.

“There’s no point in being a suffragette about this. It’s either that or get yourself killed after breakfast. It’s up to you.”

The mouth turned down with distaste. She shrugged her shoulders. She said ungraciously, “Oh, all right then.”Suddenly her eyes flared. “Only don’t ever touch me or I shall kill you.”

There came the click of Bond’s bedroom door. Bond looked mildly down at Tilly Masterton. “The challenge is attractive. But don’t worry. I won’t take it up.”He turned and strolled out of the room.

One of the Koreans passed him carrying the girl’s breakfast. In his room another Korean had brought in a typist’s desk and chair and a Remington portable. He arranged them in the corner away from the bed. Oddjob was standing in the doorway. He held out a sheet of paper. Bond went up to him and took it.

It was a foolscap memo sheet. The writing, with a ball point, was neat, careful, legible, undistinguished. It said：

Prepare ten copies of this agenda.

Meeting held under the chairmanship of Mr Gold

Secretaries：J. Bond

Miss Pussy Galore　The Cement Mixers. Har lem. New York City Agenda

A project with the code name OPERATION GRAND SLAM.

(Refreshments.)

At the end of this was written, “You and Miss Masterton will be fetched at 2.20. Both will be prepared to take notes. Formal dress, please.”

Bond smiled. The Koreans left the room. He sat down at the desk, slipped paper and carbons into the typewriter and set to. At least he would show the girl that he was prepared to do his stint. Gosh, what a crew！Even the Mafia had come in. How had Goldfinger persuaded them all to come? And who in heaven’s name was Miss Pussy Galore?

Bond had the copies finished by two o’clock. He went into the girl’s room and gave them to her together with a shorthand notebook and pencils. He also read her Goldfinger’s note. He said, “You’d better get these names in your head. They probably won’t be hard to identify. We can ask if we get stuck. I’ll go and get into my formal dress.”He smiled at her. “Twenty minutes to go.”

She nodded.

Walking down the corridor behind Oddjob, Bond could hear the sounds of the river—the slapping of water on the piles below the warehouse, the long mournful hoot of a ferry clearing her way, the distant thump of diesels. Somewhere beneath his feet a truck started up, revved and then growled away presumably towards the West Side Highway. They must be on the top tier of the long two-tiered building. The grey paint in the corridor smelled new. There were no side doors. Light came from bowls in the ceiling. They reached the end. Oddjob knocked. There was the sound of a Yale key being turned and two lots of bolts being pulled and they walked through and into a large bright sunlit room. The room was over the end of the warehouse and a wide picture window, filling most of the facing wall, framed the river and the distant brown muddle of Jersey City. The room had been dressed for the conference. Goldfinger sat with his back to the window at a large round table with a green baize cloth, carafes of water, yellow scratch-pads and pencils. There were nine comfortable armchairs and on the scratch-pads in front of six of them were small oblong white parcels sealed with red wax. To the right, against the wall, was a long buffet table gleaming with silver and cut glass. Champagne stood in silver coolers and there was a row of other bottles. Among the various foods Bond noticed two round five-pound tins of Beluga caviar and several terrines of foie gras. On the wall opposite the buffet hung a blackboard above a table on which there were papers and one large oblong carton.

Goldfinger watched them come towards him across the thick wine-red carpet. He gestured to the chair on his left for Tilly Masterton and to the one on the right for Bond. They sat down.

“The agenda?”Goldfinger took the copies, read the top one and handed them back to the girl. He gave a circular wave of the hand and she got up and distributed the copies round the table. He put his hand beneath the table and pressed a hidden bell. The door at the back of the room opened. One of the Koreans came in and stood waiting. “Is everything ready?”The man nodded. “You understand that no one is to come into this room but the people on your list? Good. Some of them, perhaps all, will bring a companion. The companions will remain in the anteroom. See that they have everything they wish. The cards are there and the dice? Oddjob.”Goldfinger glanced up at the Korean who had remained behind Bond’s chair. “Go and take up your position. What is the signal?”Oddjob held up two fingers. “Right. Two rings on the bell. You may go. See that all the staff carry out their duties to perfection.”

Bond said casually, “How many staff have you got?”

“Twenty. Ten Koreans and ten Germans. They are all excellent men, hand picked. Much goes on in this building. It is like below-decks in a man-of-war.”Goldfinger laid his hands flat on the table in front of him. “And now, your duties. Miss Masterton, you will take notes of any practical points that arise, anything that is likely to require action by me. Do not bother with the argument and chatter. Right?”Bond was glad to see that Tilly Masterton now looked bright and businesslike. She nodded briskly, “Certainly.”

“And, Mr Bond, I shall be interested in any reactions you may have to the speakers. I know a great deal about all these people. In their own territories they are paramount chiefs. They are only here because I have bribed them to come. They know nothing of me and I need to persuade them that I know what I am talking about and will lead them to success. Greed will do the rest. But there may be one or more who wish to back out. They will probably reveal themselves. In their cases I have made special arrangements. But there may be doubtful ones. During the talk, you will scribble with your pencil on this agenda. Casually you will note with a plus or a minus sign opposite the names whether you consider each one for or against the project. I shall be able to see what sign you have made. Your views may be useful. And do not forget, Mr Bond, that one traitor among them, one backslider, and we could quickly find ourselves either dead or in prison for life.”

“Who is this Pussy Galore from Harlem?”

“She is the only woman who runs a gang in America. It is a gang of women. I shall need some women for this operation. She is entirely reliable. She was a trapeze artiste. She had a team. It was called ‘Pussy Galore and her Abrocats’.”Goldfinger did not smile. “The team was unsuccessful, so she trained them as burglars, cat burglars. It grew into a gang of outstanding ruthlessness. It is a Lesbian organization which now calls itself ‘The Cement Mixers’. Even the big American gangs respect them. She is a remarkable woman.”

A buzzer sounded very softly beneath the table. Goldfinger straightened himself. The door at the end of the room opened briskly and five men came in. Goldfinger rose in his chair and ducked his head in welcome. He said, “My name is Gold. Will you please be seated.”

There was a careful murmur. Silently the men closed round the table, pulled out chairs and sat down. Five pairs of eyes looked coldly, warily at Goldfinger. Goldfinger sat down. He said quietly, “Gentlemen, in the parcels before you you will find one twentyfour- carat gold bar, value fifteen thousand dollars. I thank you for the courtesy of your attendance. The agenda is self-explanatory. Perhaps, while we wait for Miss Galore, I could run through your names for the information of my secretaries, Mr Bond here, and Miss Masterton. No notes will be made of this meeting, except on action you may wish me to take, and I can assure you there are no microphones. Now then, Mr Bond, on your right is Mr Jed Midnight of the Shadow Syndicate operating out of Miami and Havana.”

Mr Midnight was a big, good-living man with a jovial face but slow careful eyes. He wore a light blue tropical suit over a white silk shirt ornamented with small green palm trees. The complicated gold watch on his wrist must have weighed nearly half a pound. He smiled tautly at Bond and said, “Howdo.”

“Then we have Mr Billy Ring who controls the famous Chicago ‘Machine’.”

Bond thought he had never seen anyone who was less of a 'Billy'. It was a face out of a nightmare and, as the face turned towards Bond, it knew it was, and watched Bond for his reactions. It was a pale, pear-shaped, baby face with downy skin and a soft thatch of straw-coloured hair, but the eyes, which should have been pale blue, were a tawny brown. The whites showed all round the pupils and gave a mesmeric quality to the hard thoughtful stare, unsoftened by a tic in the right eyelid which made the right eye wink with the heartbeat. At some early stage in Mr Ring’s career someone had cut off Mr Ring’s lower lip—perhaps he had talked too much—and this had given him a permanent false smile like the grin of a Hallowe'en pumpkin. He was about forty years old. Bond summed him up as a merciless killer. Bond smiled cheerfully into the hard stare of Mr Ring’s left eye and looked past him at the man Goldfinger introduced as Mr Helmut Springer of the Detroit Purple Gang.

Mr Springer had the glazed eyes of someone who is either very rich or very dead. The eyes were pale blue opaque glass marbles which briefly recognized Bond and then turned inwards again in complete absorption with self. The rest of Mr Springer was a ‘man of distinction’”—casually pin-striped, Hathaway-shirted, Aqua-Velva’d. He gave the impression of someone who found himself in the wrong company—a first-class ticket holder in a third-class compartment, a man from the stalls who has been shown by mistake to a seat in the pit.

Mr Midnight put his hand up to his mouth and said softly for Bond’s benefit, “Don’t be taken in by the Duke. My friend Helmut was the man who put the piqued shirt on the hood. Daughter goes to Vassar, but it’s protection money that pays for her hockey-sticks.”Bond nodded his thanks.

“And Mr Solo of the Unione Siciliano.”

Mr Solo had a dark heavy face, gloomy with the knowledge of much guilt and many sins. His thick hom-rimmed spectacles helioed briefly in Bond’s direction and then bent again to the business of cleaning Mr Solo’s nails with a pocket knife. He was a big, chunky man, half boxer, half head waiter, and it was quite impossible to tell what was on his mind or where his strength lay. But there is only one head of the Mafia in America and,.if Mr Solo had the job, thought Bond, he had got it by strength out of terror. It would be by the exercise of both that he kept it.

“Howdy.”Mr Jack Strap of the Spangled Mob had the synthetic charm of a front man for the Las Vegas casinos, but Bond guessed he had inherited from the late lamented brothers Spang thanks to other qualities. He was an expansive, showily dressed man of about fifty. He was coming to the end of a cigar. He smoked it as if he was eating it, munching hungrily. From time to time he turned his head sideways and discreetly spat a scrap of it out on to the carpet behind him. Behind this compulsive smoking there would be a lot of tension. Mr Strap had quick conjuror’s eyes. He seemed to know that his eyes frightened people because now, presumably not wanting to frighten Bond, he gave them charm by crinkling them at the corners.

The door at the back of the room opened. A woman in a black masculine-cut suit with a high coffee-coloured lace jabot stood in the doorway. She walked slowly, unselfconsciously down the room and stood behind the empty chair. Goldfinger had got to his feet. She examined him carefully and then ran her eyes round the table. She said a collective, bored 'Hi' and sat down. Mr Strap said 'Hi Pussy,”and the others, except Mr Springer who merely bowed, made careful sounds of welcome.

Goldfinger said, “Good afternoon, Miss Galore. We have just been through the formality of introductions. The agenda is before you, together with the fifteen-thousand-dollar gold bar I asked you to accept to meet the expense and inconvenience of attending this meeting.”

Miss Galore reached for her parcel and opened it. She weighed the gleaming yellow brick in her hand. She gave Goldfinger a direct, suspicious look. “All the way through?”

“All the way through.”

Miss Galore held his eyes. She said “Pardon my asking”with the curt tone of a hard woman shopper at the sales.

Bond liked the look of her. He felt the sexual challenge all beautiful Lesbians have for men. He was amused by the uncompromising attitude that said to Goldfinger and to the room, “All men are bastards and cheats. Don’t try any masculine hocus on me. I don’t go for it. I’m in a separate league.”Bond thought she would be in her early thirties. She had pale, Rupert Brooke good looks with high cheekbones and a beautiful jawline. She had the only violet eyes Bond had ever seen. They were the true deep violet of a pansy and they looked candidly out at the world from beneath straight black brows. Her hair, which was as black as Tilly Masterton’s, was worn in an untidy urchin cut. The mouth was a decisive slash of deep vermilion. Bond thought she was superb and so, he noticed, did Tilly Masterton who was gazing at Miss Galore with worshipping eyes and lips that yearned. Bond decided that all was now clear to him about Tilly Masterton.

Goldfinger said, “And now I must introduce myself. My name is not Gold. My credentials are as follows. By various operations, most of them illegitimate, I have made a large sum of money in twenty years. That sum now stands at sixty million dollars.”(A respectful hm-ing went round the table.) 'My operations have, for the most part, been confined to Europe, but you may be interested to know that I founded and subsequently disposed of the ‘Golden Poppy Distributors’ who operated out of Hongkong.”(Mr Jack Strap whistled softly.) “The ‘Happy Landings Travel Agency’”which some of you may have employed in emergency, was organized and owned by me until I disbanded it.”(Mr Helmut Springer screwed a rimless monocle into one glazed eye so that he could examine Goldfinger more closely.) “I mention these minor concerns to show you that, although you may not know me, I have, in the past, acted at many removes on, I believe, all your behalfs.”(“Well, whaddya know！”muttered Mr Jed Midnight with something like awe in his voice.) “That, gentlemen and—er—madam, is how I knew of you and how I came to invite here tonight what I have learned through my own experience to be the aristocracy, if I may so describe it, of American crime.”

Bond was impressed. Goldfinger had, in three minutes flat, got the meeting on his side. Now everyone was looking towards Goldfinger with profound attention. Even Miss Pussy Galore’s eyes were rapt. Bond knew nothing about the Golden Poppy Distributors or the Happy Landings Agency, but they must have run like clockwork from the expressions on their former customers’ faces. Now everyone was hanging on Goldfinger’s words as if he was Einstein.

Goldfinger’s face showed no emotion. He made a throw-away gesture of his right hand. He said flatly, “I have mentioned two projects of mine that were successful. They were small. There have been many others of a higher calibre. Not one of them has failed, and, so far as I know, my name is on the police files of no country. I say this to show you that I thoroughly understand my—our—profession. And now, gentlemen and madam, I propose to offer you partnership in an undertaking that will assuredly place in each of your treasuries, within one week, the sum of one billion dollars.”Mr Goldfinger held up his hand. “We have different views in Europe and America as to what constitutes the arithmetical expression ‘a billion’. I use the word in the sense of one thousand million.Do I make myself clear?”





CHAPTER EIGHTEEN CRIME DE LA CRIME


A TUG hooted on the river. Another answered. A flurry of engine noises receded.

Mr Jed Midnight, on Bond’s right, cleared his throat. He said emphatically, “Mister Gold, or whatever your name is, don’t you worry about definitions. A billion dollars is a lot of money whichever way you say it. Keep talking.”

Mr Solo raised slow black eyes and looked across the table at Goldfinger. He said, “Is very moch money, yess. But how moch your cut, mister?”

“Five billion.”

Jack Strap from Las Vegas gave a short boisterous laugh. “Listen fellers, what’s a few billion between friends. If Mister—er—Whoosis can lead me to a billion dollars I’ll be glad to slip him a fin or even maybe a mega-fin for his trouble. Don’t let’s be smallminded about this, huh?”

Mr Helmut Springer tapped his monocle on the gold brick in front of him. Everyone looked towards him. “Mister—ah—Gold.”It was the grave voice of the family lawyer. “These are big figures you mention. As I understand it, a total of some eleven billion dollars is involved.”

Mr Goldfinger said with precision, “The exact figure will be nearer fifteen billion. For convenience I referred only to the amounts I thought it would be possible for us to carry away.”

A sharp excited giggle came from Mr Billy Ring.

“Quite, quite, Mr Gold.”Mr Springer screwed his monocle back into his eye to observe Goldfinger’s reactions. “But quantities of bullion or currency to that amount are to be found gathered together in only three depositories in the United States. They are the Federal Mint in Washington, the Federal Reserve Bank in New York City, and Fort Knox in Kentucky. Do you intend that we should—er—‘knock off’ one of these? And if so which?”

“Fort Knox.”

Amidst the chorus of groans, Mr Midnight said resignedly, “Mister, I never met any guy outside Hollywood that had what you’ve got. There ifscalled ‘vision’. And vision, mister, is a talent for mistaking spots before the eyes for fabulous projects. You should have a talk with your head-shrinker or get yourself Miltownized.”Mr Midnight shook his head sorrowfully. “Too bad. That billion sure felt good while I had it.”

Miss Pussy Galore said in a deep, bored voice, “Sorry mister, none of my set of bent pins could take that kind of piggy-bank.”She made to get up.

Goldfinger said amiably, “Now hear me through, gentlemen and—er—madam. Your reaction was not unexpected. Let me put it this way：Fort Knox is a bank like any other bank. But it is a much bigger bank and its protective devices are correspondingly stronger and more ingenious. To penetrate them will require corresponding strength and ingenuity. That is the only novelty in my project—that it is a big one. Nothing else. Fort Knox is no more impregnable than other fortresses. No doubt we all thought the Brink organization was unbeatable until half a dozen determined men robbed a Brink-armoured car of a million dollars back in 1950. It is impossible to escape from Sing Sing and yet men have found ways of escaping from it. No, no, gentlemen. Fort Knox is a myth like other myths. Shall I proceed to the plan?”

Billy Ring hissed through his teeth, like a Japanese, when he talked. He said harshly, “Listen, shamus, mebbe ya didn’t know it, but the Third Armoured is located at Fort Knox. If that’s a myth, why don’t the Russkis come and take the United States the next time they have a team over here playing ice-hockey?”

Goldfinger smiled thinly. “If I may correct you without weakening your case, Mr Ring, the following is the order of battle of the military units presently quartered at Fort Knox. Of the Third Armoured Division, there is only the Spearhead, but there are also the 6th Armoured Cavalry Regiment, the 15th Armour Group, the 160th Engineer Group and approximately half a division from all units of the United States Army currently going through the Armoured Replacement Training Centre and Military Human Research Unit No 1. There is also a considerable body of men associated with Continental Armoured Command Board No 2, the Army Maintenance Board and various activities connected with the Armoured Centre. In addition there is a police force consisting of twenty officers and some four hundred enlisted men. In short, out of a total population of some sixty thousand, approximately twenty thousand are combat troops of one sort or another.”

“And who’s going to say boo to them?”jeered Mr Jack Strap through his cigar. Without waiting for an answer he disgustedly tore the tattered stump out of his mouth and mashed it to fragments in the ash-tray.

Next to him Miss Pussy Galore sucked her teeth sharply with the incisiveness of a parrot spitting. She said, “Go buy yourself some better smokes, Jacko. That thing smells like burning wrestlers’ trunks.”

“Shove it, Puss,”said Mr Strap inelegantly.

Miss Galore was determined to have the last word. She said sweetly, “Know what, Jacko? I could go for a he-man like you. Matter of fact I wrote a song about you the other day. Care to hear its title? It’s called ‘If I had to do it all over again, I’d do it all over you’.”

A bray of laughter came from Mr. Midnight, a high giggle from Mr. Ring. Goldfinger tapped lightly for order. He said patiently, “Now hear me through, please, gentlemen.”He got up and walked to the blackboard and pulled a roll map down over it. It was a detailed town map of Fort Knox including the Godman Army Airfield and the roads and railway tracks leading into the town. The committee members on the right of the table swivelled their chairs. Goldfinger pointed to the Bullion Depository. It was down on the left-hand corner en closed in a triangle formed by the Dixie Highway, Bullion Boulevard and Vine Grove Road. Goldfinger said, “I will show you a detailed plan of the depository in just a moment.”He paused. “Now, gentlemen, allow me to point out the main features of this fairly straightforward township. Here”—he ran his finger from the top centre of the map down through the town and out beyond the Bullion Depository—“runs the line of the Illinois Central Railroad from Louisville, thirty-five miles to the north, through the town and on to Elizabeth-town eighteen miles to the south. We are not concerned with Brandenburg Station in the centre of the town, but with this complex of sidings adjoining the Bullion Vault. That is one of the loading and unloading bays for the bullion from the Mint in Washington. Other methods of transport to the vault, which are varied in no particular rotation for security reasons, are by truck convoy down the Dixie Highway or by freight plane to Godman Airfield. As you can see, the vault is isolated from these routes and stands alone without any natural cover whatsoever in the centre of approximately fifty acres of grassland. Only one road leads to the vault, a fifty-yard driveway through heavily armed gates on Bullion Boulevard. Once inside the armoured stockade, the trucks proceed on to this circular road which runs round the vault to the rear entrance where the bullion is unloaded. That circular road, gentlemen, is manufactured out of steel plates or flaps. These plates are on hinges and in an emergency the entire steel surface of the road can be raised hydraulically to create a second internal stockade of steel. Not so obvious to the eye, but known to me, is that an underground delivery tunnel runs below the plain between Bullion Boulevard and Vine Grove Road. This serves as an additional means of access to the vault through steel doors that lead from the wall of the tunnel to the first sub-ground floor of the depository.”

Goldfinger paused and stood away from the map. He looked round the table. “All right, gentlemen. There is the vault and those are the main approaches to it with the exception of its front door which is purely an entrance to the reception hall and offices. Any questions?”

There were none. All eyes were on Goldfinger, waiting. Once again the authority of his words had gripped them. This man seemed to know more about the secrets of Fort Knox than had ever been released to the outside world.

Goldfinger turned back to the blackboard and pulled down a second map over the first. This was the detailed plan of the Gold Vault. Goldfinger said, “Well, gentlemen, you can see that this is an immensely solid two-storey building somewhat like a square, two-layered cake. You will notice that the roof has been stepped for bomb protection, and you will observe the four pill boxes on the ground at the four corners. These are of steel and are connected with the interior of the building. The exterior dimensions of the vault are a hundred and five by a hundred and twenty-one feet. The height from ground level is forty-two feet. The construction is of Tennessee granite, steel-lined. The exact constituents are：sixteen thousand cubic feet of granite, four thousand cubic yards of concrete, seven hundred and fifty tons of reinforcing steel and seven hundred and sixty tons of structural steel. Right? Now, within the building, there is a two-storey steel and concrete vault divided into compartments. The vault door weighs more than twenty tons and the casing of the vault is of steel plates, steel I-beams and steel cylinders laced with hoopbands and encased in concrete. The roof is of similar construction and is independent of the roof of the building. A corridor encircles the vault at both levels and gives access both to the vault and to the offices and storerooms that are housed in the outer wall of the building. No one person is entrusted with the combination to the door of the vault. Various senior members of the depository staff must separately dial combinations known only to each of them. Naturally the building is equipped with the latest and finest protective devices. There is a strong guardpost within the building and immensely powerful reinforcements are at all times available from the Armoured Centre less than a mile distant. Do you follow me? Now, as to the actual content of the vault—these amount, as I said earlier, to some fifteen billion dollars' worth of standard mint bars one thousand fine. Each bar is double the size of the one before you and contains four hundred Troy ounces, the avoirdupois weight being some twenty-seven and a half pounds. These are stored without wrappings in the compartments of the vault.”Goldfinger glanced round the table. “And that, gentlemen and madam,”he concluded flatly, “is all I can tell you, and all I think we need to know, about the nature and contents of Fort Knox Depository. Unless there are any questions at this stage, I will proceed to a brief explanation of how this depository may be penetrated and its contents seized.”

There was siknce. The eyes round the table were rapt, intent. Nervously, Mr Jack Strap took a medium-sized cigar out of his vest pocket and stuffed it in the corner of his mouth.

Pussy Galore said sternly, “If you set fire to that thing I swear I’ll kill you with my gold brick.”She took a threatening hold of the bar.

“Take it easy, kid,”said Mr. Strap out of the corner of his mouth.

Mr. Jed Midnight commented decisively, “Mister, if you can heist that joint, you got yourself a summum cum laude. Go ahead and tell. This is either a bust or the Crime de la Crime.”

Goldfinger said indifferently, “Very well, gentlemen. You shall hear the plan.”He paused and looked carefully round the table and into each pair of eyes in turn. “But I hope you understand that total security must now prevail. What I have said so far, if repeated, would be taken for the maunderings of a lunatic. What I am about to say will involve all of us in the greatest peace-time conspiracy in the history of the United States. May I take it that we are all bound by an oath of absolute secrecy?”

Almost instinctively, Bond watched the eyes of Mr. Helmut Springer from Detroit. While affirmatives in various tones of voice came from the others, Mr. Springer veiled his eyes. His portentous “You have my solemn word”rang hollow. To Bond, the candour was as false as a second-hand motor salesman’s. Casually he drew a short straight minus line beside Mr Springer’s name on the agenda.

“Very well then.”Goldfinger returned to his seat at the table. He sat down, picked up his pencil and began talking to it in a thoughtful, conversational voice. “First, and in some ways most difficult, is the question of disposal. One billion dollars of gold bullion weighs approximately one thousand tons. To transport this amount would require one hundred ten-ton trucks or some twenty six-wheel heavy industry road transporters. I recommend the latter vehicles. I have a list of the charter companies who hire out this type of vehicle and I recommend that, if we are to be partners, you should proceed immediately after this meeting to contracting with the relevant companies in your territories. For obvious reasons you will all wish to engage your own drivers and this I must leave in your hands.No doubt”—Mr. Goldfinger allowed himself the ghost of a smile—“the Teamsters’ Union will prove a fruitful source for reliable men and you will perhaps consider recruiting exdrivers from the Negro Red Ball Express that served the American armies during the war. However, these are details requiring exact planning and co-ordination. There will also be a traffic control problem and no doubt you will make arrangements among yourselves for sharing out the available roads. Transport aircraft will be a subsidiary source of mobility and arrangements will be made to keep open the north-south runway on the Godman Airfield. Your subsequent disposal of the bullion will, of course, be your own affair. For my part”—Goldfinger looked coolly round the table—“I shall initially be using the railroad and, since I have a bulkier transport problem, I trust you will allow me to reserve this means of egress for my own.”Goldfinger did not wait for comment. He continued in an even tone：“Compared with this problem of transport, the other arrangements will be relatively simple. To begin with, on D—1,1 propose to put the entire population, military and civilian, of Fort Knox temporarily out of action. Exact arrangements have been made and only await my signal. Briefly, the town is supplied with all drinking and other watersupplies by two wells and two filter plants yielding just under seven million gallons per day. These are under the control of the Post Engineer. This gentleman has been pleased to accept a visit from the Superintendent and Deputy Superintendent of the Tokyo Municipal Waterworks who wish to study the workings of a plant of this size for installation in a new suburb planned for the environs of Tokyo. The Post Engineer has been much flattered by this request and the Japanese gentlemen will be accorded all facilities. These two gentlemen, who are, of course, members of my staff, will be carrying on their persons relatively small quantities of a highly concentrated' opiate devised by the German chemical warfare experts for just this purpose during the last war. This substance disseminates rapidly through a volume of water of this magnitude, and, in its consequent highly diluted form, has the effect of instant but temporary narcosis of any person drink ing half a tumbler of the infected water. The symptoms are a deep and instant sleep from which the victim awakens much refreshed in approximately three days. Gentlemen”—Goldfinger held out one hand palm upwards—“in the month of June in Kentucky I consider it out of the question that a single resident is able to go through twenty-four hours without consuming half a glass of water. There may perhaps be a handful of confirmed alcoholics on their feet on D-Day, but I anticipate that we shall enter a town in which virtually the entire population has fallen into a deep sleep where they stand.”

“What was that fairytale?”Miss Galore’s eyes were shining with the vision.

“Puss in Boots,”said Mr Jack Strap in a surly voice. “Go ahead, mister. This is good. How do we get into the town?”

“We come in,”said Goldfinger, “on a special train that will have left New York City on the night of D-l. There will be approximately one hundred of us and we shall be attired as Red Cross workers. Miss Galore will, I hope, provide the necessary contingent of nurses. It is to fill this minor but important role that she has been invited to this meeting.”

Miss Galore said enthusiastically, “Wilco, Roger, over and out！My girls’ll look sweet in starch. Whaddya say, Jacko?”She leant sideways and nudged Mr Strap in the ribs.

“I say they'd look better in cement overcoats,”said Mr. Strap impatiently. “Whaddya have to keep on butting in for? Keep going, mister.”

“At Louisville, thirty-five miles from Fort Knox, I myself and an assistant will ask to be allowed to ride in the leading diesel. We shall have delicate instruments. We shall say that it will be necessary for us to sample the air as we approach Fort Knox for, by this time, news of the mysterious affliction that has struck down the inhabitants will have reached the outer world and there is likely to be some panic in the surrounding area, and indeed in the country as a whole. Rescue planes may be expected to approach shortly after our arrival at dawn and an early task will be to man the control tower at Godman Airfield, declare the base closed and re-route all planes to Louisville. But, to go back for a moment, shortly after leaving Louisville, my assistant and I will dispose of the driver and fireman by as humane methods as are possible”(I bet, thought Bond) “and I shall personally bring the train—I may say that I have the requisite knowledge of these locomotives—through Fort Knox to the bullion sidings alongside the depository.”Goldfinger paused. He looked with slow, grave eyes round the circle. Satisfied with what he saw, he continued in the same even tone. “By this time, gentlemen and madam, your transport convoys should be arriving. The traffic controller will dispose them in the neighbourhood of the depository according to a pre-arranged plan, the airport staff will proceed by truck to Godman Airfield and take over, and we shall enter the depository, paying no heed to the sleeping bodies with which the landscape will be—er—decorated. Right?”

Mr. Solo’s dark eyes burned across the table. He said softly, “Sure, is right so far. Now mebbe you”—he blew out his cheeks and gave a quick hard puff towards Goldfinger—“like this and the twenty-ton door he fall down. Yes?”

“Yes,”said Goldfinger equably. “Almost exactly like that.”He rose and went to the table under the blackboard, lifted up the big ungainly carton and carried it carefully back and placed it on the table in front of him. It seemed to be very heavy.

He sat down and continued, “While ten of my trained assistants are making preparations for the vault to be opened, stretcher teams will enter the depository and remove to safety as many of the inmates as can be located.”Bond thought he noticed a treacherous purr underlying Goldfinger’s next words. “I am sure you will all agree, gentlemen and madam, that all unnecessary loss of life should be avoided. Thus far, I hope you notice that there have been no casualties with the exception of two employees of the Illinois Central Railroad who have received sore heads.”Goldfinger didn’t wait for comment but went on. “Now,”he reached out and placed his hand on the carton, “when you, gentlemen, and your associates have needed weapons, other than the conventional small arms, where have you found them? At military establishments, gentlemen. You have purchased submachine guns and other heavy equipment from quartermaster storekeepers at nearby military bases. You have achieved this by the use of pressure, blackmail or money. I have done the same. Only one weapon would be powerful enough to blast open the Bullion Vault at Fort Knox and I obtained one, after much seeking, from a certain allied military base in Germany. It cost me exactly one million dollars. This, gentlemen, is an atomic warhead designed for use with the Corporal Intermediate Range Guided Missile.”

“Cheesus Kerist.”Jed Midnight’s hands reached for the edge of the table beside Bond and gripped it.

All the faces round the table were pale. Bond could feel the skin taut over his own tensed jaw. To break his tension he reached inside his coat pocket for the Chesterfields and lit one. He slowly blew out the flame and put the lighter back in his pocket. God Almighty！What had he got himself into? Bond looked back down the vista of his knowledge of Goldfinger. The first meeting with the naked brown body on the roof of the Floridiana Cabana Club. The casual way he had rapped Goldfinger’s knuckles. The interview with M. The meeting at the bank at which it.had been a question of tracking down a gold smuggler—admittedly a big one and one who worked for the Russians—but still only a man-sized criminal, someone Bond had taken trouble to beat at golf and then had pursued coolly, efficiently, but still as only one more quarry like so many others. And now！Now it was not a rabbit in the rabbit hole, not even a fox, it was a king cobra—the biggest, most deadly inhabitant of the world！Bond sighed wearily. Once more into the breach, dear friends！This time it really was St George and the dragon. And St George had better get a move on and do something before the dragon hatched the little dragon’s egg he was now nesting so confidently. Bond smiled tautly. Do what? What in God’s name was there he could do?

Goldfinger held up his hand. “Gentlemen and madam, believe me, this object is an entirely harmless lump of machinery. It is not armed. If I hit it with a hammer it would not explode. Nothing can make it explode until it is armed and that will not happen until The Day.”

Mr. Billy Ring’s pale face was shiny with sweat. The words trembled slightly as they hissed out through the false grin. “Mister, what… what about this thing they call—er—fall-out?”

“Fall-out will be minimal, Mr. Ring, and extremely localized. This is the latest model—the so-called ‘clean’ atomic bomb. But protection suits will be issued to the squad that first enters the ruins of the building. They will form the first in the human chain that will remove the gold and pass it to the waiting trucks.”

“Flying debris, Mister? Chunks of concrete and steel and so forth?”Mr. Midnight’s voice came from somewhere in his stomach.

“We shall take shelter behind the outer steel stockade of the depository, Mr. Midnight. All personnel will wear earplugs. There may be minor damage to some of the trucks, but that hazard must be accepted.”

“Da sleeping guys?”Mr Solo’s eyes were greedy. “Mebbe dey jess sleeps a little longer?”Mr Solo obviously didn’t worry too much about the sleeping guys.

“We shall move as many as possible to safety. We must, I am afraid, accept minor damage to the town. I estimate that casualties among the population will approximately equal three days' toll on the roads of Fort Knox. Our operation will merely serve to keep road accident statistics at a steady level.”

“Damn nice of us.”Mr. Midnight’s nerves had now recovered.

“Any more questions?”Goldfinger’s voice was bland. He had read out the figures, estimated the prospects for the business. Now it was time to put the meeting to the vote. “Details remain to be worked out exactly. In that, my staff here”—he turned first to Bond and then to Miss Masterton— “will be assisting me. This room will be our operations room to which you will all have access by day or by night. The code word for the project is ‘Operation Grand Slam’, which will always be used in referring to the project. May I suggest that those of you who wish to participate should brief one, and only one, of your most trusted lieutenants. Other staff can be trained for their functions as if this were a run-of-the-mill bank robbery. On D-l a slightly wider briefing of staff will be necessary. I know I can rely on you, gentlemen and madam, if you decide to participate, to treat this whole project as an operation of war. Inefficiency or insecurity will of course have to be dealt with decisively. And now, gentlemen and madam, I will ask you to reply on behalf of your respective organizations. Which of you wishes to enter this race? The prize is gigantic. The risks are minimal. Mr. Midnight?”Goldfinger turned his head an inch to die right. Bond saw the wide open X-ray gaze devour his neighbour. “Yes?”There was a pause. “Or no?”





CHAPTER NINETEEN SECRET APPENDIX


“MR GOLD,”Jed Midnight pronounced sonorously, “you are undoubtedly the greatest thing in crime since Cain invented murder and used it on Abel.”He paused and added emphatically, “I shall count it an honour to be associated with you in this enterprise.”

“Thank you, Mr. Midnight. And you, Mr Ring?”Bond was doubtful about Mr. Billy Ring. He had scrawled plusses against all the names except Ring and Helmut Springer. To Mr Ring he had allotted a nought, to Springer a minus sign. He had come to his conclusions by watching eyes, mouths, hands, but nothing had been betrayed by The Grinner’s unwavering false smile. The wink in his right eye had been as steady on the pulse-beat as a metronome and he had kept his hands below the table.

Now Billy Ring brought his hands up from below the table and formed a cat’s cradle with them on the green baize in front of him. For a moment he watched the two thumbs twirling, then he raised his nightmare face to Goldfinger’s. The tic in his right eye had stopped. The two rows of teeth began to operate like a ventriloquist’s dummy. “Mister1—he found difficulty with his b’s, m’s and p’s and produced them by bringing his upper lip down over his teeth like a horse does when it takes sugar out of your hand—“long time now my friends and I been back in legal. What I mean, the old days of leaving corpses strewn all over the landscape went out with the 'forties. Me and my associates, we do all right with the girls, the hemp, and the racetrack, and when we’re short there’s our good friends the Union to slip us the odd fin. Ya see, mister,”—The Grinner opened his hands and then put them back into the cradle—“we figger the old days are gone. Big Jim Colossimo, Johnny Torrio, Dion O’ Bannion, Al Capone—where are those guys today, huh? Mister, they’re pushing up the morning glory by the fence. Mebbe you weren’t around in the days when we used to hide up between fights in Little Bohemia up behind Milwaukee? Well, siree, in those days, people were shooting at each other so fast you’d often need a programme to tell the act from the spectators. So all right, people got tired of it—those that hadn’t already got tired to death, if you get my meaning—and when the ‘fifties come along and I take over the team, it’s unanimous that we get out of the fireworks business. And now what, mister? Now you come along and put it to me that me and my friends assist you to let off the biggest fizzbang in history！So what do I figger to say to your proposition, Mister—er—Whoosis? Well, I tell you, mister. Everybody’s got his price, see?—and for a billion dollars it’s a deal. We’ll put away the marbles and bring out the sling-shots. We're in.”

“Grinner, you sure take one hell of a long time to say yes,”commented Mr Midnight sourly.

Goldfinger said cordially, “Thank you for your most interesting statement, Mr. Ring. I am very happy to welcome you and your associates. Mr. Solo?”

Mr. Solo prefaced his reply by reaching into his coat pocket and taking out a battery shaver. He switched it on. The room filled with the noise of angry bees. Mr. Solo leant his head back and began running the machine thoughtfully up the right side of his face while his uptilted eyes sought decision in the ceiling. Suddenly he switched the razor off, put it down on the table in front of him and jerked his head down and forward like a snake striking. The black gun-muzzles of his eyes pointed threateningly across the table at Goldfinger and moved slowly from feature to feature of the big moon-face. Half Mr Solo’s own face now looked naked. The other half was dark with the Italian swarthiness that comes from an uncontrollable beard growth. Bond guessed that he probably had to shave every three or four hours. Now Mr Solo decided to speak. He spoke in a voice that brought chill into the room. He said softly, “Mister, I been watching you. You are a very relaxed man for someone who speaks such big things. Last man I knew was so much relaxed he got himself totally relaxed by a quick burst of the chopper. Okay, okay.”Mr. Solo sat back. He spread open palms in reluctant surrender. “So I come in, yes. But mister”—there was a pause for emphasis—“either we get that billion or you get dead. Is okay with you?”

Goldfinger’s lips bent ironically. “Thank you, Mr. Solo. Your conditions are quite acceptable. I have every wish to stay alive. Mr. Helmut Springer?”

Mr. Springer’s eyes looked deader than ever. He said pompously, “I am still giving the matter my full consideration. Pray consult my colleagues while I deliberate.”

Mr. Midnight commented impatiently, “Same old Hell. Waits for what he calls inspiration. He’s guided—messages from the Almighty on the angels' wavelength. I guess he hasn’t heard a human voice in twenty years.”

“And Mr. Strap?”

Mr. Jack Strap crinkled his eyes at Goldfinger. He said smoothly, “Mister, I figure you know the odds and you surely pay the best since one of our machines at Vegas got the trots and gave continuous jackpots. I guess if we provide the muscles and the guns this caper’ll pay off. You can count me in.”Mr Strap turned off the charm. His eyes, now frightening again, turned, with Goldfinger’s, to Miss Pussy Galore.

Miss Galore veiled her violet eyes so as not to have to look at either of them. She said indifferently to the room at large, “Business ain’t been so brisk in my corner of the woods.”She tapped with long, silver-painted finger-nails on the gold bar before her. “Mind you, I won’t say I’m overdrawn at the bank. Let’s put it I’m just a shade under-deposited. Yup.Sure I’ll come in. Me and my gals got to eat.”

Goldfinger allowed himself a half-smile of sympathy. “That is excellent news, Miss Galore. And now,”he turned to face across the table, “Mr Springer, might we ask if you have made up your mind?”

Slowly Mr. Springer rose to his feet. He gave the controlled yawn of an opera goer. He followed the yawn with a small belch. He took out a fine linen handkerchief and patted his lips. His glazed eyes moved round the table and finally rested on Goldfinger. Slowly his head moved from side to side as if he was trying to exercise fibrositis in his neck muscles. He said gravely, like a bank manager refusing a loan, “Mr. Gold, I fear your proposal would not find favour with my colleagues in Detroit.”He gave a little bow which included everyone. “It only remains for me to thank you for a most interesting occasion.Good afternoon, gentlemen and madam.”In the chilly silence, Mr. Springer tucked his handkerchief carefully into the left-hand cuff of his immaculate pin-stripe, turned and walked softly to the door and let himself out.

The door closed with a sharp click. Bond noticed Gold finger’s hand slip casually below the table. He guessed that Oddjob was getting his signal. Signal for what?

Mr. Midnight said nastily, “Glad he’s out. He’s strictly a four-ulcer man. Now then”—he got up briskly and turned to Bond—“how about a little drink?”

They all rose and gathered round the buffet. Bond found himself between Miss Pussy Galore and Tilly Masterton. He offered them champagne. Miss Galore looked at him coldly and said, “Move over, Handsome. Us girls want to talk secrets. Don’t we, yummy?”Miss Masterton blushed and then turned very pale. She whispered adoringly, “Oh yes please, Miss Galore.”

Bond smiled sourly at Tilly Masterton and moved down the room.

Jed Midnight had witnessed the snub. He got close to Bond and said earnestly, “Mister, if that’s your doll, you better watch her. Pussy gets the girls she wants. She consumes them in bunches—like grapes, if you follow me.”Mr Midnight sighed wearily. “Cheesus how they bore me, the lizzies！You’ll see, she’ll soon have that frail parting her hair three ways in front of the mirror.”

Bond said cheerfully, “I’ll watch out. There’s nothing much I can do. She’s an independent sort of a girl.”

“That so?”said Mr. Midnight with a spark of interest. “Well mebbe I can help to break it up.”He straightened his tie. “I could go for that Masterton. She’s sure got natural resources.See you around.”He grinned at Bond and moved off down the room.

Bond was having a quiet square meal off caviar and champagne and thinking how well Goldfinger had handled the meeting when the door at the end of the room opened and one of the Koreans hurried in and went up to Goldfinger. Goldfinger bent his head to the whispered words. His face became grave. He rapped a fork on his glass of Saratoga Vichy.

“Gentlemen and madam.”He looked sadly round the group. “I have received bad news.Our friend Mr Helmut Springer has met with an accident. He fell down the stairs. Death was instantaneous.”

“Ho, ho！”Mr. Ring’s laugh was not a laugh. It was a hole in the face. “And what does that Slappy Hapgood, his torpedo, have to say about it?”Goldfinger said gravely, “Alas, Mr. Hapgood also fell down the stairs and has succumbed to his injuries.”

Mr Solo looked at Goldfinger with new respect. He said softly, “Mister, you better get those stairs fixed before me and my friend Giulio come.to use them.”

Goldfinger said seriously, “The fault has been located. Repairs will be put in hand at once.”His face grew thoughtful. “I fear these accidents may be misconstrued in Detroit.”

Jed Midnight said cheerfully, “Don’t give it a thought, mister. They love funerals up there. And it’ll take a load off their minds. Old Hell wouldn’t have lasted much longer. They been stoking the fires under him these twelve months.”He appealed to Mr. Strap who stood next to him. “Am I right, Jacko?”

“Sure, Jed,”said Mr Strap sagely. “You got the score. Mr. Helmut M. Springer had to be hit.”

“Hit”—mobese for murder. When Bond at last got to bed that night, he couldn’t wipe the word out of his mind. Oddjob had got the signal, a double ring,—and Springer and his guard had got hit. There had been nothing Bond could have done about it—even if he had wanted to, and Mr Helmut Springer meant nothing to him, probably richly deserved to be hit anyway—but now some 59,998 other people were going to get hit unless he, and only he, could do something about it.

When the meeting of paramount hoods had broken up to go about their various duties, Goldfinger had dismissed the girl and kept Bond in the room. He told Bond to take notes and then for more than two hours went over the operation down to the smallest detail.

When they came to the doping of the two reservoirs (Bond had to work out an exact timetable to ensure that the people of Fort Knox would all be “under”in good time) Bond had asked for details of the drug and its speed of action.

“You won’t have to worry about that.”

“Why not? Everything depends on it.”

“Mr. Bond.”Goldfinger’s eyes had a faraway, withdrawn look. “I will tell you the truth because you will have no opportunity of passing it on. From now, Oddjob will not be more than a yard from your side and his orders will be strict and exact. So I can tell you that the entire population of Fort Knox will be dead or incapacitated by midnight on D-l. The substance that will be inserted in the water supply, outside the filter plant, will be a highly concentrated form of GB.”

“You’re mad！You don’t really mean you’re going to kill sixty thousand people！”

“Why not? American motorists do it every two years.”

Bond stared into Goldfinger’s face in fascinated horror. It couldn’t be true！He couldn’t mean it！He said tensely, What’s this GB?”

“GB is the most powerful of the Trilone group of nerve poisons. It was perfected by the Wehrmacht in 1943, but never used for fear of reprisals. In fact, it is a more effective instrument of destruction than the hydrogen bomb. Its disadvantage lies in the difficulty of applying it to the populace. The Russians captured the entire German stocks at Dyhernfurth on the Polish frontier. Friends of mine were able to supply me with the necessary quantities. Introduction through the water supply is an ideal method of applying it to a densely populated area.”

Bond said, “Goldfinger, you’re a lousy,——bastard.”

“Don’t be childish. We have work to do.”

Later, when they had got to the problem of transporting the tons of gold out of the town, Bond had had one last try. He said, “Goldfinger, you’re not going to get this stuff away.Nobody’s going to get their hundred tons of gold out of. the place—let alone five hundred.You’ll find yourself tearing down the Dixie Highway in a truck with a few gold bars loaded with gamma rays and the American Army on your tail. And you’ll have killed sixty thousand people for that? The thing’s farcical. Even if you do get a ton or two away, where the hell do you think you’re going to hide it?”

“Mr. Bond.”Goldfinger’s patience was infinite. “It just happens that a Soviet cruiser of the Sverdlovsk class will be visiting Norfolk, Virginia, on a goodwill cruise at that time. It sails from Norfolk on D+1. Initially by train and then by transport convoy, my gold will arrive on board the cruiser by midnight on D-Day. I shall sail in the cruiser for Kronstadt. Everything has been carefully planned, every possible hitch has been foreseen. I have lived with this operation for five years. Now the time has come for the performance. I have tidied up my activities in England and Europe. Such small debris as remains of my former life can go to the scavengers who will shortly be sniffing on my trail. I shall be gone. I shall have emigrated and, Mr Bond, I shall have taken the golden heart of America with me. Naturally,”Goldfinger was indulgent “this unique performance will not be immaculate. There has not been enough time for rehearsals. I need these clumsy gangsters with their guns and their men, but I could not bring them into the plan until the last moment. They will make mistakes. Conceivably they will have much trouble getting their own loot away. Some will be caught, others killed. I couldn’t care less. These men are amateurs who were needed, so to speak, for the crowd scenes. They are extras, Mr Bond, brought in off the streets. What happens to them after the play is of no interest to me whatsoever. And now, on with the work. I shall need seven copies of all this by nightfall.Where were we…?”

So in fact, reflected Bond feverishly, this was not only a Goldfinger operation with SMERSH in the background. SMERSH had even got the High Praesidium to play. This was Russia versus America with Goldfinger as the spearhead！Was it an act of war to steal something from another country? But who would know that Russia had the gold? No one, if the plan went off as Goldfinger intended. None of the gangsters had an inkling. To them Goldfinger was just another of them, another gangster, slightly larger than life-size. And Goldfinger’s staff, his drivers for the golden convoy to the coast? Bond himself, and Tilly Masterton? Some would be killed, including him and the girl. Some, the Koreans for instance, would no doubt sail in the cruiser. Not a trace would be left, not a witness. It was modern piracy with all the old-time trimmings. Goldfinger was sacking Fort Knox as Bloody Morgan had saked Panama. There .was no difference except that the weapons and the techniques had been brought up to date.

And there was only one man in the whole world who could stop it. But how?

The next day was an unending blizzard of paper-work. Every half-hour a note would come in from Goldfinger’s operations room asking for schedules of this, copies of that, estimates, timetables, lists of stores. Another typewriter was brought in, maps, reference books—anything that Bond re quisitioned. But not once did Oddjob relax the extreme care with which he opened the door to Bond’s knock, not once did his watchful eyes wander from Bond’s eyes, hands, feet when he came into the room to bring meals or notes or supplies. There was no question of Bond and the girl being part of the team. They were dangerous slaves and nothing else.

Tilly Masterton was equally reserved. She worked like a machine—quick, willing, accurate, but uncommunicative. She responded with cool politeness to Bond’s early attempts to make friends, share his thoughts with her. By the evening, he had learnt nothing about her except that she had been a successful amateur ice-skater in between secretarial work for Unilevers. Then she had started getting star parts in ice-shows. Her hobby had been indoor pistol and rifle shooting and she had belonged to two marksman clubs. She had few friends. She had never been in love or engaged. She lived by herself in two rooms in Earls Court. She was twenty-four. Yes, she realized that they were in a bad fix. But something would turn up. This Fort Knox business was nonsense. It would certainly go wrong. She thought Miss Pussy Galore was “divine”. She somehow seemed to count on her to get her out of this mess. Women, with a sniff, were rather good at things that needed finesse. Instinct told them what to do. Bond was not to worry about her. She would be all right.

Bond came to the conclusion that Tilly Masterton was one of those girls whose hormones had got mixed up. He knew the type well and thought they and their male counterparts were a direct consequence of giving votes to women and “sex equality”. As a result of fifty years of emancipation, feminine qualities were dying out or being transferred to the males. Pansies of both sexes were everywhere, not yet completely homosexual, but confused, not knowing what they were. The result was a herd of unhappy sexual misfits—barren and full of frustrations, the women wanting to dominate and the men to be nannied. He was sorry for them, but he had no time for them. Bond smiled sourly to himself as he remembered his fantasies about this girl as they sped along the valley of the Loire. Entre Deux Seins indeed！

At the end of the day, there was a final note from Goldfinger：

Five principals and myself will leave La Guardia Airport tomorrow at 11 am in chartered plane flown by my pilots for aerial survey of Grand Slam. You will accompany. Masterton will remain. G.

Bond sat on the edge of his bed and looked at the wall. Then he got up and went to the typewriter. He worked for an hour, typing, single-spaced, on both sides of the sheet, exact details of the operation. He folded the sheet, rolled it to a small cylinder about the size of his little finger and sealed it carefully with gum. Next he typed on a slip of paper：

URGENT AND VITAL. REWARD OF FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IS GUARANTEED WITH NO QUESTIONS ASKED TO THE FINDER WHO DELIVERS THIS MESSAGE UNOPENED TO FELIX LEITER CARE PINKERTON'S DETECTIVE AGENCY, 154 NASSAU STREET, NEW YORK CITY. IMMEDIATE CASH ON DELIVERY.

Bond rolled this message round the cylinder, wrote $5000 REWARD in red ink on the outside, and stuck the little package down the centre of three inches of Scotch tape. Then he sat down again on the edge of the bed and carefully strapped the free ends of the Scotch tape down the inside of his thigh.





CHAPTER TWENTY JOURNEY INTO HOLOCAUST


“MISTER, Flying Control is buzzing us. Wants to know who we are. They say this is restricted air.”

Goldfinger got up from his seat and went forward into the cockpit. Bond watched him pick up the hand microphone. His voice came back clearly over the quiet hum of the tenseater Executive Beechcraft. “Good morning. This is Mr Gold of Paramount Pictures Corporation. We are carrying out an authorized survey of the territory for a forthcoming ‘A’ picture of the famous Confederate raid of 1861 which resulted in the capture of General Sherman at Muldraugh Hill. Yes, that’s right. Gary Grant and Elizabeth Taylor in the lead. What’s that? Clearance? Sure we’ve got clearance. Let me see now' (Goldfinger consulted nothing),”yes, here it is. Signed by Chief of Special Services at the Pentagon. “Sure, the Commanding Officer at the Armoured Centre will have a copy. Okay and thanks. Hope you’ll enjoy the picture. “Bye.”

Goldfinger wiped the breezy expression off his face, handed over the microphone and came back into the cabin. He braced his legs and stood looking down at his passengers. “Well, gentlemen and madam, do you think you’ve seen enough? I think you’ll agree it’s all pretty clear and conforms with your copies of the town plan. I don’t want to go much lower than six thousand. Perhaps we could make one more circuit and be off. Oddjob, get out the refreshments.”

There was a mumble of comment and questions which Goldfinger dealt with one by one. Oddjob got up from Bond’s side and walked down to the rear. Bond followed him and, under his hard, suspicious stare, went into the little lavatory and locked the door.

He sat down calmly and thought. There hadn’t been a chance on the way down to La Guardia. He had sat with Oddjob in the back of an unobtrusive Buick saloon. The doors had been locked on them by the driver and the windows tightly closed. Goldfinger had ridden in front, the partition closed behind him. Oddjob had sat slightly sideways, his horn-ridged hands held ready on his thighs like heavy tools. He had not taken his eyes off Bond until the car had driven round the boundary to the charter hangars and come up alongside the private plane. Sandwiched between Goldfinger and Oddjob, Bond had had no alternative but to climb up the steps into the plane and take his seat with Oddjob beside him. Ten minutes later, the others had arrived. There was no communication with them except an exchange of curt greetings. They were all different now—no smart remarks, no unnecessary talk. These were men who had gone to war. Even Pussy Galore, in a black Dacron macintosh with a black leather belt, looked like some young S.S. guardsman. Once or twice in the plane she had turned and looked at Bond rather thoughtfully. But she hadn’t answered his smile. Perhaps she just couldn’t understand where Bond fitted in, who he was. When they got back to La Guardia there would be the same routine. It was now or never. But where? Among the leaves of lavatory paper? But they might be disturbed too soon or not for weeks. Would the ash-tray be emptied? Possibly not. But one thing would.

There was a rattle at the door-handle. Oddjob was getting restless. Perhaps Bond was setting fire to the plane. Bond called, “Coming, ape.”He got up and lifted the seat. He tore the little package off the inside of his thigh and transferred it to the underside of the foreedge of the seat. The seat would have to be lifted to get at the Elsan and that would certainly be looked to as soon as the plane got back to the hangar. The $5000 REWARD stared back at him boldly. Not even the most hasty cleaner could miss it. So long as no one preceded the cleaner. But Bond didn’t think any of the passengers would lift the seat. The little compartment was too cramped to stand comfortably in. He softly put the seat down, ran some water in the basin, washed his face and smoothed his hair and walked out.

Oddjob was waiting angrily. He pushed past Bond, looked carefully round the lavatory and came out again, shutting the door. Bond walked back to his seat. Now the SOS was in the bottle and the bottle had been committed to the waves. Who would be the finder? How soon?

Everyone, down to the pilot and co-pilot, went to the blasted little lavatory before they got back on the ground. As each one came out, Bond expected to feel the cold nose of a gun in his neck, the harsh suspicious words, the crackle of the paper being unfolded. But at last they were back in the Buick and speeding over the Triborough into uptown Manhattan and then down the river on the parkway and in through the well-guarded doors of the warehouse and back to work.

Now it was a race—a race between Goldfinger’s calm, unhurried, efficient machine and the tiny gunpowder trail Bond had lit. What was going on outside? During every hour of the next three days Bond’s imagination followed what might be happening—Leiter telling his chief, the conference, the quick flight down to Washington, the FBI and Hoover, the Army, the President. Leiter insisting that Bond’s conditions be adhered to, that no suspicious moves be made, no inquiries started, that no one moved an inch except according to some master plan that would operate on the day and get the whole gang into the bag so that not one of them escaped.

Would they accept Bond’s conditions or would they not dare take the chance? Had they talked across the Atlantic with M? Had M insisted that Bond should be somehow pulled out? No, M would see the point. He would agree that Bond’s life must be disregarded. That nothing must jeopardize the big clean-up. They would have to get the two “Japanese”, of course, somehow beat out of them the code message Goldfinger would be waiting for on D-1.

Was that how it was going, or was it all a shambles? Leiter away on another assignment. “Who is this 007? What does it stand for? Some crazy loon. Hi, Smith, check on this, could you? Get down to the warehouse and take a look. Sorry, mister, no five grand for you. Here’s car fare back to La Guardia. Afraid you’ve been hoaxed.”

Or, worse still, had none of these things happened? Was the plane still standing in a corner of the field, unserviced?

Night and day, the torment of thoughts went through Bond’s head while the work got cleared and the hours ticked by and the deadly machine whirred quietly on. D-1 came and flashed by in a last fever of activity. Then, in the evening, came the note from Goldfinger.

First phase of operation successful. Entrain as planned at midnight. Bring copies of all maps, schedules, operation orders. G.

In close formation, with Bond and Tilly Masterton—he in a white surgeon’s coat, she dressed as a nurse—wedged in the middle, the Goldfinger contingent marched swiftly through the almost empty Concourse of Pennsylvania station and down to the waiting Special. Everyone, including Goldfinger, was wearing the conventional white garb and armbands of a medical field force and the dim platform was crowded with the ghostly waiting figures of the posses from the gangs. The silence and tension was appropriate for an emergency force hurrying to the scene of a disaster, and the stretcher and decontamination suits being loaded into the compartments added drama to the scene. The Superintendent was talking quietly with the senior physicians in the shape of Midnight, Strap, Solo and Ring. Nearby stood Miss Galore with a dozen pale-faced nurses who waited with eyes bent as if they stood beside an open grave. Without makeup, their exotic hair-do’s tucked into dark blue Red Cross caps, they had been well rehearsed. They were giving an excellent performance—dutiful, merciful, dedicated to the relief of human suffering.

When the Superintendent saw Goldfinger and his party approaching he hurried up. “Mr. Gold?”his face was grave. “I’m afraid the news coming through isn’t too good. Guess it’ll all be in the papers tonight. All trains held at Louisville, no reply from the depot at Fort Knox. But we’ll get you through all right. God Almighty, Doctor！What’s going on down there? People coming through from Louisville are talking about the Russians spraying something from the air. Of course”—the Superintendent looked keenly at Goldfinger—“I’m not believing that kind of stuff. But what is it? Food poisoning?”

Goldfinger’s face was solemn. He said in a kindly voice, “My friend, that’s what we’ve got to find out. That’s why we're being rushed down. If you want me to make a guess, but mark you it’s only a guess, it’s a form of sleeping sickness—trypanosomiasis we call it.”

“That so?”the Superintendent was impressed by the sound of the malady. “Well, believe you me, Doctor, we’re all mighty proud of you and your folks of the Emergency Force.”He held out his hand, Goldfinger took it. “Best of luck, Doc; and now, if you’ll get your men and the nurses on board, I’ll have this train on its way just as quick as may be.”

“Thank you, Superintendent. My colleagues and I will not forget your services.”Goldfinger gave a short bow. His contingent moved on.

“Board！”

Bond found himself in a Pullman with Tilly Masterton across the aisle and the Koreans and Germans all around them. Goldfinger was in the front of the car talking cheerfully with his satraps. Miss Pussy Galore strolled by. She ignored the upturned face of Tilly Masterton but gave Bond the usual searching glance. There was a banging of doors being closed. Pussy Galore stopped and rested an arm on the back of the seat in front of Bond. She looked down at him. “Hullo, Handsome. Long time no see. Uncle doesn’t seem to let you off the lead much.”

Bond said, “Hullo, Beautiful. That outfit suits you fine. I’m feeling rather faint. How about doing a bit of nursing?”The deep violet eyes examined him carefully. She said softly, “You know what, Mister Bond? I got a feeling there’s something phoney about you. I got instincts, see? Just what are you and that doll”—she jerked her head back—“doing in this outfit?”

“We do all the work.”

The train began to move. Pussy Galore straightened herself. She said, “Mebbe you do. But if any little thing goes wrong with this caper, for my money it’ll be Handsome who knows why. Get me?”

She didn’t wait for Bond’s answer, but moved on down and joined the Chiefs of Staff meeting.

It was a confused, busy night. Appearances had to be kept up before the inquisitive, sympathetic eyes of the conductors. Last-minute conferences up and down the train had to wear the appearance of serious medical conclaves—no cigar smoking, no swearing, no spitting. Jealousies and competition between the gangs had to be kept under rigid control. The cold superiority of the Mafia, particularly vis-a-vis Jack Strap and his soft, easy living crowd from the West, might have led to gunplay if the chiefs hadn’t been ready for trouble and constantly on the lookout for it. All these minor psychological factors had been foreseen by Goldfinger and prepared for. The women from the Cement Mixers were carefully segregated, there was no drinking and the gang chiefs kept their men occupied with further exact briefings, dummy exercises with maps and lengthy discussions about their escape plans with the gold. There was casual spying on each other’s plans and Goldfinger was often called in to judge who should have which routes to the Mexican border, to the desert, to Canada. To Bond it was amazing that a hundred of the toughest crooks in America, on edge with excitement and greed, could be kept as quiet as they were. It was Goldfinger who had achieved the miracle. Apart from the calm, dangerous. quality of the man, it was the minuteness of the planning and the confidence he exuded that calmed the battle nerves and created some sort of a team-spirit among the rival mobs.

As the iron gallop of the train stretched itself out through the flat lands of Pennsylvania, gradually the passengers fell into an uneasy, troubled sleep. But not Goldfinger or Oddjob. They remained awake and watchful and soon Bond gave up any idea he might have had of using one of his hidden knives on Odd job and making a bid for freedom when the train slowed through a station or on an up-gradient.

Bond dozed fitfully, wondering, imagining, puzzling over the Superintendent’s words. The Superintendent had certainly thought they were the truth, knew that Fort Knox was in emergency. Was his news from Louisville the truth or part of the giant cover plan that would be necessary to get every member of the conspiracy in the bag? If it was a cover plan, how meticulously had it been prepared? Would someone slip up? Would there be some ghastly bungle that would warn Goldfinger in time? Or if the news was true, if the poison had been successful, what did there remain for Bond to do?

Bond had made up his mind on one score. Somehow, in the excitement of H-Hour, he would get close to Goldfinger and cut his throat with one of his hidden knives. How much would that achieve apart from an act of private vengeance? Would Goldfinger’s squad accept another man’s order to arm the warhead and fire it? Who would be strong enough, cool enough to take over? Mr. Solo? Probably. The operation would perhaps be half successful, they would get away with plenty of gold—except Goldfinger’s men who would be lost without him to lead them. And in the meantirne, whatever else Bond could not do, had sixty thousand people already died? Was there anything he could have done to prevent that? Had there ever been a chance to kill Goldfinger? Would it have done any good to make a scene at Pennsylvania Station? Bond stared at his dark reflection in the window, listened to the sweet ting of the grade-crossing bells and the howl of the windhorn clearing their way, and shredded his nerves with doubts, questions, reproaches.





CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE THE RICHEST MAN IN HISTORY


SLOWLY THE red dawn broke over the endless plain of black grass that gradually turned to the famous Kentucky blue as the sun ironed out the shadows. At six o’clock the train began to slacken speed and soon they were gliding gently through the waking suburbs of Louisville to come to rest with a sigh of hydraulics in the echoing, almost deserted station.

A small, respectful group was awaiting them. Goldfinger, his eyes black-ringed with lack of sleep, beckoned to one of the Germans, picked up his authoritative little black bag and stepped down on to the platform. There was a short, serious conclave, the Louisville Superintendent doing the talking and Goldfinger interjecting a few questions and nodding gravely at the answers. Goldfinger turned wearily back to the train. Mr Solo had been deputed to take his report. He stood at the open door at the end of the Pullman. Bond heard Goldfinger say sorrowfully, “I am afraid, Doctor, the situation is as bad as we feared. I will now go forward to the leading diesel with this,”he held up the black bag, “and we will proceed slowly into the infected area. Would you please tell all personnel to be prepared to put on their masks? I have masks for the driver and fireman. All other railway personnel will leave the train here.”

Mr. Solo nodded solemnly. “Right, Professor.”He closed his door. Goldfinger walked off down the platform followed by his German strong-arm man and the respectful, headshaking group.

There was a short pause and then silently, almost reverently, the long train whispered its way out of the station leaving the little group of officials, now reinforced by four rather shamefaced conductors, with hands raised in benediction.

Thirty-five miles, half an hour, to go！Coffee and doughnuts were brought round by the nurses, and (Goldfinger thought of everything) for those whose nerves needed it, two grains of dexedrine. The nurses were pale, silent. There were no jokes, no smart remarks. The train was electric with tension.

After ten minutes there was a sudden slackening of speed and a sharp hiss from the brakes. Coffee was spilled. The train almost stopped. Then there was a jerk and it gathered speed again. A new hand had taken over on the dead man’s handle.

A few minutes later, Mr Strap came hurrying through the train. “Ten minutes to go！On your toes, folks！Squads A, B and C get their equipment on. Everything’s going fine. Stay calm. Remember your duties.”He hurried through to the next compartment and Bond heard the voice repeating its message.

Bond turned to Oddjob. “Listen, you ape, I’m going to the lavatory and probably Miss Masterton will too.”He turned to the girl. “What about it, Tilly?”

“Yes,”she said indifferently, “I suppose I’d better.”Bond said, “Well, go ahead.”The Korean beside the girl looked inquiringly at Oddjob. Oddjob shook his head.

Bond said, “Unless you leave her alone I’m going to start a fight. Goldfinger won’t like that.”He turned to the girl. “Go ahead, Tilly. I’ll see to these apes.”

Oddjob uttered a series of barks and snarls which the other Korean seemed to understand. The guard got up and said, “Okay, but not locking the door.”He followed the girl down the Pullman and stood and waited for her to come out.

Oddjob carried out the same routine with Bond. Once inside, Bond took off his right shoe, slid out the knife and slipped it down inside the waist-band of his trousers. One shoe would now have no heel, but no one was going to notice that this morning. Bond washed himself. The face in the mirror was pale and the blue-grey eyes dark with tension. He went out and back to his seat.

Now there was a distant shimmer away to the right and a hint of low buildings rising like a mirage in the early morning ground mist. They slowly defined themselves as hangars with a squat control tower. Godman Field！The soft pounding howl of the train slackened. Some trim modern villas, part of a new housing development, slid by. They seemed to be unoccupied. Now, on the left, there was the black ribbon of Brandenburg Station Road. Bond craned. The gleaming modern sprawl of Fort Knox looked almost soft in the light mist. Above its jagged outline the air was dear as crystal—not a trace of smoke, no breakfasts cooking！The train slowed to a canter. On Station Road there had been a bad motor accident. Two cars seemed to have met head on. The body of a man sprawled half out of a smashed door. The other car lay on its back like a dead beetle. Bond’s heart pounded. The main signal box came and went. Over the levers something white was draped. It was a man’s shirt.

Inside the shirt the body hung down, its head below the level of the window. A row of modern bungalows. A body clad in singlet and trousers flat on its face in the middle of a trim lawn. The lines of mown grass were beautifully exact until, near the man, the mower had written an ugly flourish and had then come to rest on its side in the newly turned earth of, the border. A line of washing that had broken when the woman had grasped it. The woman lay in a white pile at one end of the sagging string of family underclothes, cloths and towels. And now the train was moving at walking pace into the town and everywhere, down every street, on every sidewalk, there were the sprawling figures—singly, in clumps, in rocking-chairs on the porches, in the middle of intersections where the traffic lights still unhurriedly ticked off their coloured signals, in cars that had managed to pull up and in others that had smashed into shop windows. Death！Dead people everywhere. No movement, no sound save the click of the murderer’s iron feet as his train slid through the graveyard.

Now there was bustle in the carriages. Billy Ring came through grinning hugely. He stopped by Bond’s chair. “Oh boy！”he said delightedly, “old Goldie certainly slipped them the Micky Finn！Too bad some people were out for a ride when they got hit. But you know what they say about omelettes：can’t make 'em without you break some eggs, right?”

Bond smiled tightly. “That’s right.”

Billy Ring made his silent O of a laugh and went on his way.

The train trundled through Brandenburg Station. Now there were scores of bodies—men, women, children, soldiers. The platform was scribbled with them, faces upwards to the roof, down in the dust, cradled sideways. Bond searched for movement, for an inquisitive eye, for a twitching hand. Nothing！Wait！What was that? Thinly through the closed window there came a soft, mewing wail. Three perambulators stood against the ticket office, the mothers collapsed beside them. Of course！The babies in the perambulators would have drunk milk, not the deadly water.

Oddjob got to his feet. So did the whole of Goldfinger’s team. The faces of the Koreans were indifferent, unchanged, only their eyes flickered constantly like nervous animals. The Germans were pale, grim. Nobody looked at anyone else. Silently they filed towards the exit and lined up, waiting.

Tilly Masterton touched Bond’s sleeve. Her voice trembled. “Are you sure they’re only asleep? I thought I saw some sort of… sort of froth on some of the lips.”

Bond had seen the same thing. The froth had been pink. He said, “I expect some of them were eating sweets or something when they fell asleep. You know what these Americans are—always chewing something.”He softly mouthed the next words. “Stay away from me. There may be shooting.”He looked hard at her to see she understood.

She nodded dumbly, not looking at him. She whispered out of the corner of her mouth, “I’m going to get near Pussy. She’ll look after me.”

Bond gave her a smile and said “Good”, encouragingly.

The train clicked slowly over some points and slid to rest. There came one blast of the diesel’s windhorn. The doors swung open and the different groups piled out on to the platform of the Bullion Depository siding.

Now everything went with military precision. The various squads formed up in their battle order—first an assault group with sub-machine guns, then the stretcher-bearers to get the guard and other personnel out of the vault (surely an unnecessary refinement now, thought Bond) then Goldfinger’s demolition team—ten men with their bulky tarpaulincovered package—then a mixed group of spare drivers and traffic-control men, then the group of nurses, now all armed with pistols, who were to stay in the background with a heavily armed reserve group that was to deal with any unexpected interference from anybody who, as Goldfinger had put it, “might wake up”.

Bond and the girl had been included in the Command Group which consisted of Goldfinger, Oddjob and the five gang leaders. They were to be stationed on the flat roofs of the two diesel locomotives which now stood, as planned, beyond the siding buildings and in full view of “the objective and its approaches. Bond and the girl were to handle the maps, the timetables and the stop-watch, and Bond was to watch out for fumbles and delays and bring them at once to Goldfinger’s attention to be rectified by walkie-talkie with die squad leaders. When the bomb was due to be fired, they would take shelter behind the diesels.

There came a double blast from the windhorn and, as Bond and the girl climbed to their position on the roof of the first diesel, the assault squad, followed by the other sections, doubled across the twenty yards of open ground between the railway and Bullion Boulevard. Bond edged as close as he could to Goldfinger. Goldfinger had binoculars to his eyes. His mouth was close to the microphone strapped to his chest. But Oddjob stood between them, a solid mountain of flesh, and his eyes, uninterested in the drama of the assault, never flickered from Bond and the girl.

Bond, under cover of scanning his plastic map-case and keeping an eye on the stopwatch, measured inches and angles. He glanced at the next-door group of the four men and the woman. They were gazing, in frozen attention, at the scene before them. Now Jack Strap said excitedly, “They’re through the first gates.”Bond, putting half his mind to work on his own plans, took a quick look at the battlefield.

It was an extraordinary scene. In the centre stood the huge squat mausoleum, the sun glinting off the polished granite of its walls. Outside the big open field in which it stood, the roads—the Dixie Highway, Vine Grove and Bullion Boulevard—were lined with trucks and transporters two deep with the recognition flags of the gangs flying from the first and last vehicle of each convoy. Their drivers lay piled up outside the shelter of the surrounding guard wall of the vault while, through the main gate, poured the tidy disciplined squads from the train. Outside this world of movement there was absolute stillness and silence as if the rest of America was holding its breath at the committal of this gigantic crime. And outside lay the bodies of the soldiers, sprawling where they had fallen—the sentries by their pill boxes, still clutching their automatic pistols, and, inside the protecting wall, two ragged squads of soldiers in battledress. They lay in vague, untidy heaps, some bodies athwart or on top of their neighbours. Outside, between Bullion Boulevard and the main gate, two armoured cars had crashed into each other and now stood locked, their heavy machine guns pointing, one at the ground and the other at the sky. A driver’s body sprawled out of the turret of one of the vehicles.

Desperately Bond looked for a sign of life, a sign of movement, a hint that all this was a careful ambush. Nothing！Not a cat moved, not a sound came out of the crowded buildings that formed a backdrop to the scene. Only the squads hurried about their tasks or now stood waiting in their planned dispositions.

Goldfinger spoke quietly into his microphone. “Last stretcher out. Bomb squad ready. Prepare to take over.”

Now the covering troops and the stretcher-bearers were hurrying for the exit, getting down under cover of the guard wall. There would be five minutes' delay to clear the area before the bomb squad, now waiting bunched at the main gate, would go in.

Bond said efficiently, “They’re a minute ahead of time.”

Goldfinger looked past Oddjob’s shoulder. The pale eyes were aflame. They stared into Bond’s. Goldfinger’s mouth twisted into a harsh snarl. He said through his teeth, “You see, Mr Bond. You were wrong and I was right. Ten more minutes and I shall be the richest man in the world, the richest man in history！What do you say to that?”His mouth spat out the words.

Bond said equably, “I’ll tell you after those ten minutes are up.”

“Will you?”said Goldfinger. “Maybe.”He looked at his watch and spoke rapidly into his microphone. The Goldfinger squad loped slowly through the main gate, their heavy burden slung from four shoulders in a cradle of webbing.

Goldfinger looked past Bond at the group on the roof of the second diesel. He called out triumphantly, “Another five minutes, gentlemen, and then we must take cover.”He turned his eyes on Bond and added softly, “And then we will say goodbye, Mr Bond. And thank you for the assistance you and the girl have given me.”

Out of the corner of his eye, Bond saw something moving—moving in the sky. It was a black, whirling speck. It reached the top of its trajectory, paused and then came the earsplitting crack of a maroon signal.

Bond’s heart leapt. A quick glance showed him the ranks of dead soldiers springing to life, the machine guns on the locked armoured cars swinging to cover the gates. A loudspeaker roared from nowhere, “Stand where you are. Lay down your arms.”But there came a futile crackle of fire from one of the rearguard covering party and then all hell broke loose.

Bond seized the girl round the waist and jumped with her.

It was a tenfoot drop to the platform. Bond broke his fall with his left hand and hoisted the girl to her feet with a jerk of his hip. As he began to run, close to the train for cover, he heard Goldfinger shout, “Get them and kill them.”A splatter of lead from Goldfinger’s automatic whipped at the cement to his left. But Goldfinger would have to shoot left handed. It was Oddjob that Bond feared. Now, as Bond tore down the platform with the girl’s hand in his, he heard the lightning scuffle of the running feet.

The girl’s hand tugged at him. She screamed angrily, “No, No. Stop！I want to stay close to Pussy. I’ll be safe with her.”

Bond shouted back, “Shut up, you little fool！Run like hell！”But now she was dragging at him, checking his speed. Suddenly she tore her hand out of his and made to dart into an open Pullman door. Christ, thought Bond, that’s torn it！He whipped the knife out of his belt and swirled to meet Oddjob.

Ten yards away Oddjob hardly paused in his rush. One hand whipped off his ridiculous, deadly hat, a glance to take aim and the black steel half-moon sang through the air. Its edge caught the girl exactly at the nape of the neck. Without a sound she fell backwards on to the platform in Oddjob’s path. The hurdle was just enough to put Oddjob off the flying high kick he had started to launch at Bond’s head. He turned the kick into a leap, his left hand cutting the air towards Bond like a sword. Bond ducked and struck upwards and sideways with his knife. It got home somewhere near the ribs but the momentum of the flying body knocked the knife out of his hand. There was a tinkle on the platform. Now Oddjob was coming back at him, apparently unharmed, his hands outstretched and his feet “ splayed back ready for another leap or a kick. His blood was up. The eyes were red and there was a fleck of saliva at the open, panting mouth.

Above the boom and rattle of the guns outside the station, three blasts sounded on the diesel’s windhorn. Oddjob snarled angrily and leapt. Bond dived at full length sideways. Something hit him a gigantic blow on the shoulder and sent him sprawling. Now, he thought as he hit the ground, now the death stroke！He scrambled clumsily to his feet, his neck hunched into his shoulders to break the impact. But no blow came and Bond’s dazed eyes took in the figure of Oddjob flying away from him up the platform.

Already the leading diesel was on the move. Oddjob got to it and leapt for the footplate. For a moment he hung, his legs scrabbling for a foothold. Then he had disappeared into the cabin and the huge streamlined engine gathered speed.

Behind Bond the door of the quartermaster’s office burst open. There was the hammer of running feet and a yell “Santiago！”—St James, the battle-cry of Cortez that Leiter had once jokingly allotted to Bond.

Bond swivelled. The straw-haired Texan, clad in his wartime Marine Corps battledress, was pounding up the platform followed by a dozen men in khaki. He carried a one-man bazooka by the steel hook he used for a right hand. Bond ran to meet him. He said, “Don’t shoot my fox, you bastard. Give over.”He snatched the bazooka out of Leiter’s hand and threw himself down on the platform, splaying out his legs. Now the diesel was two hundred yards away and about to cross the bridge over the Dixie Highway. Bond shouted, “Stand clear！”to get the men out of line of the recoil flash, clicked up the safe and took careful aim. The bazooka shuddered slightly and the ten-pound armour-piercing rocket was on its way. There was a flash and a puff of blue smoke. Some bits of metal flew off the rear of the flying engine. But then it had crossed the bridge and taken the curve and was away.

“Not bad for a rookie,”commented Leiter. “May put the rear diesel out, but those jobs are twins and he can make it on the forward engine.”

Bond got to his feet. He smiled warmly into the hawk-like, slate-grey eyes. “You bungling oaf,”he said sarcastically, “why in hell didn’t you block that line?”

“Listen, shamus. If you’ve got any complaints about the stage management you can tell them to the President. He took personal command of this operation and it’s a honey. There’s a spotter plane overhead now. They'll pick up the diesel and we’ll have old Goldilocks in the hoosegow by midday. How were we to know he was going to stay aboard the train?”He broke off and thumped Bond between the shoulderblades. “Hell, I’m glad to see you. These men and I were detailed off to give you protection. We’ve been dodging around looking for you and getting shot at by both sides for our pains.”He turned to the soldiers. “Ain’t that right, men?”

They laughed. “Sure is, Cap’n.”

Bond looked affectionately at the Texan with whom he had shared so many adventures. He said seriously, “Bless you, Felix. You’ve always been good at saving my life. It was darn nearly too late this time. I’m afraid Tilly Masterton’s had it.”He walked off up the train with Felix at his heels. The little figure still lay sprawled where she had fallen. Bond knelt beside her. The broken-doll angle of the head was enough. He felt for her pulse. He got up. He said softly, “Poor little bitch. She didn’t think much of men.”He looked defensively at Leiter. “Felix, I could have got her away if she’d only followed me.”

Leiter didn’t understand. He put his hand on Bond’s arm and said, “Sure kid. Take it easy.”He turned to his men. “Two of you carry the girl into the QM’s office over there. O’Brien, you go for the ambulance. When you’ve done that, stop over at the Command post and give ‘em the facts. Say we’ve got Commander Bond and I’ll bring him right over.”

Bond stood and looked down at the little empty tangle of limbs and clothes. He saw the bright, proud girl with the spotted handkerchief round her hair in the flying TR3. Now she had gone.

High up over his head a whirling speck soared into the sky. It reached the top of its flight and paused. There came the sharp crack of the maroon. It was the cease-fire.





CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO THE LAST TRICK


IT WAS two days later. Felix Leiter was weaving the black Studillac fast through the lanes of dawdling traffic on the Triborough bridge. There was plenty of time to catch Bond’s plane, the evening BOAC Monarch to London, but Leiter enjoyed shaking up Bond’s low opinion of American cars. Now the steel hook that he used for a right hand banged the gear lever into second and the low black car leapt for a narrow space between a giant refrigerator truck and a mooning Oldsmobile whose rear window was almost obscured by holiday stickers.

Bond’s body jerked back with the kick of the 300 b.h.p. and his teeth snapped shut. When the manoeuvre was completed, and the angry hooting had vanished behind them, Bond said mildly, “It’s time you graduated out of the Kiddi-car class and bought yourself an express carriage. You want to get cracking. This pedalling along ages one. One of these days you’ll stop moving altogether and when you stop moving is when you start to die.”

Leiter laughed. He said, “See that green light ahead? Bet I can make it before it goes red.”The car leapt forward as if it had been kicked. There was a brief hiatus in Bond’s life, an impression of snipe-like flight and of a steel wall of cars that someone parted before the whiplash of Leiter’s triple klaxons, a hundred yards when the speedometer touched ninety and they were across the lights and cruising genteelly along in the centre lane.

Bond said calmly, “You meet the wrong traffic cop arid that Pinkerton card of yours won’t be good enough. It isn’t so much that you drive slowly, it’s holding back the cars behind they’ll book you for. The sort of car you need is a nice elderly Rolls Royce Silver Ghost with big plate-glass windows so you can enjoy the beauties of nature”—Bond gestured towards a huge automobile junk heap on their right. “Maximum fifty and it can stop and even go backwards if you want to. Bulb horn. Suit your sedate style. Matter of fact there should be one on the market soon—Goldfinger’s. And by the same token, what the hell’s happened to Goldfinger? Haven’t they caught up with him yet?”

Leiter glanced at his watch and edged into the outside lane. He brought the car down to forty. He said seriously, “Tell you the truth, we're all a bit worried. The papers are needling us, or rather Edgar Hoover’s crowd, like hell. First they had a gripe at the security clamp-down on you. We couldn’t tell them that wasn’t our fault and that someone in London, an old limey called M, had insisted on it. So they’re getting their own back. Say we’re dragging our feet and so forth. And I’m telling you, James”—Leiter’s voice was glum, apologetic—“we just haven’t a clue. They caught up with the diesel. Goldfinger had fixed the controls at thirty and had let it run on down the line. Somewhere he and the Korean had got off and probably this Galore girl and the four hoods as well because they’ve vanished too. We found his truck con voy, of course, waiting on the east-bound highway out of Elizabethville. But never a driver, most probably scattered, but somewhere there’s Goldfinger and a pretty tough team hiding up. They didn’t get to the Sverdlovsk cruiser at Norfolk. We had a plain-clothes guard scattered round the docks and they report that she sailed to schedule without any strangers going aboard. Not a cat’s been near that warehouse on East River and no one’s shown at Idlewild or the frontiers—Mexico and Canada. For my money, that Jed Midnight has somehow got them out to Cuba. If they’d taken two or three trucks from the convoy and driven like hell they could have got down to Florida, somewhere like Daytona Beach, by the early hours of D+l. And Midnight’s darn well organized down there. The Coast Guards and the Air Force have put out all they’ve got, but nothing’s shown yet. But they could have hidden up during the day and got over to Cuba during the night. It’s got everybody worried as hell and it’s no help that the President’s hopping mad.”

Bond had spent the previous day in Washington treading the thickest, richest red carpet. There had been speeches at the Bureau of the Mint, a big brass lunch at the Pentagon, an embarrassing quarter of an hour with the President, and the rest of the day had been hard work with a team of stenographers in Edgar Hoover’s suite of offices with a colleague of Bond’s from Station A sitting in. At the end of that, there had been a brisk quarter of an hour’s talk with M on the Embassy transatlantic scrambler. M had told him what had been happening on the European end of the case. As Bond had expected, Goldfinger’s cable to Universal Export had been treated as emergency. The factories at Reculver and Coppet had been searched and extra evidence of the gold smuggling racket had been found. The Indian Government had been warned about the Mecca plane that was already an route for Bombay and that end of the operation was on the way to being cleaned up. The Swiss Special Brigade had quickly found Bond’s car and had got on to the route by which Bond and the girl had been taken to America, but there, at Idlewild, the FBI had lost the scent. M seemed pleased with the way Bond had handled Operation Grand Slam, but he said the Bank of England were worrying him about Goldfinger’s twenty million pounds in gold. Goldfinger had assembled all this at the Paragon Safe Deposit Co in New York but had withdrawn it on D-l. He and his men had driven it away in a covered truck. The Bank of England had ready an Order in Council to impound the gold when it was found and there would then be a case to prove that it had been smuggled out of England, or at least that it was originally smuggled gold whose value had been increased by various doubtful means. But this was now being handled by the US Treasury and the FBI and, since M had no jurisdiction in America, Bond had better come home at once and help tidy things up. Oh yes—at the end of the conversation M’s voice had sounded gruff—there had been a very kind request to the PM that Bond should be allowed to accept the American Medal of Merit. Of course M had had to explain via the PM that the Service didn’t go in for those sort of things—particularly from foreign countries, however friendly they were. Too bad, but M knew that this was what Bond would have expected. He knew the rules. Bond had said yes of course and thank you very much and he’d take the next plane home.

Now, as they motored quietly down the Van Wyck Expressway, Bond was feeling vaguely dissatisfied. He didn’t like leaving ragged ends to a case. None of the big gangsters had been put in the bag and he had failed in the two tasks he had been given, to get Goldfinger and get Goldfinger’s bullion. It was nothing but a miracle that Operation Grand Slam had been broken. It had been two days before the Beechcraft had been serviced and the cleaner who found the note had got to Pinkerton’s only half an hour before Leiter was due to go off to the Coast on a big racing scandal. But then Leiter had really got cracking—to his chief, then to the FBI and the Pentagon. The FBI’s knowledge of Bond’s record, plus contact with M through the Central Intelligence Agency, had been enough to get the whole case up to the President within an hour. After that it had just been a case of building up the gigantic bluff in which all the inhabitants of Fort Knox had participated in one way or another. The two 'Japanese' had been taken easily enough and it was confirmed by Chemical Warfare that the three pints of GB carried as gin in their briefcases would have been enough to slay the entire population of Fort Knox. The two men had been quickly and forcibly grilled into explaining the form of the all clear cable to Goldfinger. The cable had been sent. Then the Army had declared emergency. Road and rail and air blocks had turned back all traffic to the Fort Knox area with the exception of the gangster convoys which had not been hindered. The rest was play-acting right down to the pink froth and the squalling babies which it was thought would add nice touches of verisimilitude.

Yes, it had all been very satisfactory so far as Washington was concerned, but what about the English end? Who in America cared about the Bank of England’s gold? Who cared that two English girls had been murdered in the course of this business? Who really minded that Goldfinger was still at liberty now that America’s bullion was safe again?

They idled across the drab plain of Idlewild, past the ten-million-dollar steel and cement skeletons that would one day be an adult airport, and pulled up outside the makeshift huddle of concrete boxes that Bond knew so well. Already the well mannered iron voices were reaching out to them. “Pan American World Airways announces the departure of its President Flight PA 100”, “Transworld Airways calling Captain Murphy. Captain Murphy, please.”And the pear-shaped vowels and fluted diction of BOAC, “BOAC announces the arrival of its Bermudan Flight BA 491. Passengers will be disembarking at gate number nine.”

Bond took his bag and said goodbye to Leiter. He said, “Well, thanks for everything, Felix. Write to me every day.”

Leiter gripped his hand hard. He said, “Sure thing, kid. And take it easy. Tell that old bastard M to send you back over soon. Next visit we’ll take some time off from the razzmatazz. Time you called in on my home state. Like to have you meet my oil-well. “Bye now.”

Leiter got into his car and accelerated away from the arrival bay. Bond raised his hand. The Studillac dry-skidded out on to the approach road. There was an answering glint from Leiter’s steel hook out of the window and he was gone.

Bond sighed. He picked up his bag and walked in and over to the BOAC ticket counter.

Bond didn’t mind airports so long as he was alone in them. He had half an hour to wait and he was quite content to wander through the milling crowds, have a bourbon and soda at the restaurant and spend some time choosing something to read at the bookstore. He bought Ben Hogan’s Modern Fundamentals of Golf and the latest Raymond Chandler and sauntered along to the Souvenir Shop to see if he could find an amusing gimmick to take back to his secretary.

Now there was a man’s voice on the BOAC announcing system. It called out a long list of Monarch passengers who were required at the ticket counter. Ten minutes later Bond was paying for one of the latest and most expensive ballpoint pens when he heard his own name being called. “Will Mr James Bond, passenger on BOAC Monarch flight No 510 to Gander and London, please come to the BOAC ticket counter. Mr James Bond, please.”It was obviously that infernal tax form to show how much he had earned during his stay in America. On principle Bond never went to the Internal Revenue Office in New York to get clearance and he had only once had to argue it out at Idlewild. He went out of the shop and across to the BOAC counter. The official said politely, “May I see your health certificate, please, Mr Bond?”

Bond took the form out of his passport and handed it over.

The man looked at it carefully. He said, “I’m very sorry, sir, but there’s "been a typhoid case at Gander and they’re insisting that all transit passengers who haven’t had their shots in the last six months should be topped up. It’s most annoying, sir, but Gander’s very touchy about these things. Too bad we couldn’t have managed a direct flight, but there’s a strong head-wind.”

Bond hated inoculations. He said irritably, “But look here, I’m stuffed with shots of one kind or another. Been having them for twenty years for one damned thing or another！”He looked round. The area near the BOAC departure gate seemed curiously deserted. He said, “What about the other passengers? Where are they?”

“They’ve all agreed, sir. Just having their shots now. It won’t take a minute, sir, if you’ll come this way.”

“Oh well.”Bond shrugged his shoulders impatiently. He followed the man behind the counter and through a door to the BOAC station manager’s office. There was the usual white-clothed doctor, a mask over the bottom of his face, the needle held ready. “Last one?”he asked of the BOAC official.

“Yes, Doctor.”

“Okay. Coat off and left sleeve up, please. Too bad they’re so sensitive up at Gander.”

“Damned sight too bad,”said Bond. “What are they afraid of? Spreading the black death?”There came the sharp smell of the alcohol and the jab of the needle.

“Thanks,”said Bond gruffly. He pulled down his sleeve and made to pick his coat up from the back of the chair. His hand went down for it, missed it, went on down, down towards the floor. His body dived after the hand, down, down, down…

All the lights were on in the plane. There seemed to be plenty of spare places. Why did he have to get stuck with a passenger whose arm was hogging the central arm-rest. Bond made to get up and change his seat. A wave of nausea swept over him. He closed his eyes and waited. How extraordinary！He was never air-sick. He felt the cold sweat on his face. Handkerchief. Wipe it off. He opened his eyes again and looked down at his arms. The wrists were bound to the arms of his chair. What had happened? He had had his shot and then passed out or something. Had he got violent? What the hell was all this about? He glanced to his right and then stared, aghast. Oddjob was sitting there. Oddjob！Odd job in BOAC uniform！

Oddjob glanced incuriously at him and reached for the steward’s bell. Bond heard the pretty ding-dong back in the pantry. There was the rustle of a skirt beside him. He looked up. It was Pussy Galore, trim and fresh in the blue uniform of a stewardess！She said, “Hi, Handsome.”She gave him the deep, searching look he remembered so well from when? From centuries ago, in another life.

Bond said desperately, “For Christ’s sake, what’s going on? Where did you come from?”

The girl smiled cheerfully, “Eating caviar and drinking champagne. You Britishers sure live the life of Reilly when you get up twenty thousand feet. Not a sign of a Brussels sprout and if there’s tea I haven’t got around to it yet. Now, you take it easy. Uncle wants to talk to you.”She sauntered up the aisle, swinging her hips, and disappeared through the cockpit door.

Now nothing could surprise Bond. Goldfinger, in a BOAC captain’s uniform that was rather too large for him, the cap squarely on the centre of his head, closed the cockpit door behind him and came down the aisle.

He stood and looked grimly down at Bond. “Well, Mr Bond. So Fate wished us to play the game out. But this time, Mr Bond, there cannot possibly be a card up your sleeve. Ha！”The sharp bark was a mixture of anger, stoicism and respect. “You certainly turned out to be a snake in my pastures.”The great head shook slowly. “Why I kept you alive！Why I didn’t crush you like a beetle！You and the girl were useful to me. Yes, I was right about that. But I was mad to have taken the chance. Yes, mad.”The voice dropped and went slow. “And now tell me, Mr Bond. How did you do it? How did you communicate?”

Bond said equably, “We will have a talk, Goldfinger. And I will tell you certain things. But not until you have taken off these straps and brought me a bottle of bourbon, ice, soda water and a packet of Chesterfields. Then, when you have told me what I wish to know, I will decide what to tell you. As you say, my situation is not favourable, or at least it doesn’t appear to be. So I have nothing to lose and if you want to get something out of me it will be on my own terms.”

Goldfinger looked gravely down. “I have no objection to your conditions. Out of respect for your abilities as an opponent, you shall spend your last journey in comfort. Oddjob”—the voice was sharp. “Ring the bell for Miss Galore and undo those straps. Get into the seat in front. There is no harm he can do at the rear of the plane but he is not to approach the cockpit door. If need be, kill him at once, but I prefer to get him to our destination alive. Understand?”

“Arrgh.”

Five minutes later Bond had what he wanted. The tray in front of him was down and on it were his whisky and cigarettes. He poured himself a stiff bourbon. Goldfinger was seated in the chair across the aisle, waiting. Bond picked up his drink and sipped it. He was about to take a deeper drink when he saw something. He put the glass carefully down without disturbing the little round paper coaster that had stuck to the bottom of his glass. He lit a cigarette, picked up his drink again and removed the ice-cubes and put them back in the ice bucket. He drank the whisky down alhnost to the end. Now he could read the words through the bottom of the glass. He carefully put the glass down without disturbing the coaster. The message had read, “I’m with you. XXX. P.”

Bond turned and made himself comfortable. He said, “Now then, Goldfinger. First of all, what’s going on, how did you get this plane, where are we heading?”

Goldfinger crossed one leg over the other. He gazed away from Bond, up the aisle. He said in a relaxed, conversational tone, “I took three trucks and drove across country to the vicinity of Cape Hatteras. One of the trucks contained my personal hoard of gold bullion. The other two contained my drivers, spare personnel and those gangsters. I required none of them except Miss Galore. I kept a nucleus of the staff I would need, paid off the others with huge sums and dispersed them gradually along the route. At the coast I held a meeting with the four gang leaders in a deserted place, having left Miss Galore under some pretext with the trucks. I shot the four men in my usual fashion—one bullet for each. I went back to the trucks and explained that the four men had chosen money and independent action. I was now left with six men, the girl and the bullion. I hired a plane and flew to Newark, New Jersey, the crates of gold being passed off as lead for X-ray plates. From there I proceeded alone to a certain address in New York from which I talked with Moscow by radio and explained the mishap to Operation Grand Slam. In the course of the talk I mentioned your name. My friends, whom I believe you know,”Goldfinger looked hard at Bond, “pass under the generic name of SMERSH. They recognized the name of Bond and told me who you were. I at once understood a great deal of what had previously been hidden from me. SMERSH said they would greatly like to interview you. I pondered the matter. In due course I conceived the plan which you now see in operation. Posing as a friend of yours, I had no difficulty in finding out the flight on which you were booked. Three of my men were formerly of the Luftwaffe. They assured me there would be no difficulty in flying this plane. The rest was mere detail. By cool bluffing, impersonation and the use of a certain amount of force, all the BOAC personnel at Idlewild, the crew of this plane and the passengers were given the necessary injections from which they will now be recovering. We changed clothes with the unconscious crew, the bullion was loaded on the plane, you were dealt with and carried out on a stretcher and in due course the new BOAC crew, with their stewardess, boarded the plane and we took to the air.”

Goldfinger paused. He lifted a hand resignedly. “Of course there were small hitches. We were told to ‘follow taxiway Alpha to runway four,’ and it was only by following a KLM plane that we were successful. The Idlewild routine was not easy to master and we must have seemed somewhat clumsy and inexperienced, but, Mr Bond, with assurance, strong nerves and a gruff, intimidating manner it is never difficult to override the Civil Service mentality of what, after all, are minor employees. I understand from the wireless operator that a search for this plane is under way. They were already questioning us before we were out of VHP range at Nan-tucket. Then the Distant Early Warning system queried us on high frequency. That did not disturb me. We have enough fuel. We have already had clearance from Moscow for East Berlin, Kiev or Murmansk. We shall take whichever route the weather dictates. There should be no trouble. If there is, I shall talk my way out of it on the radio. No one is going to shoot down a valuable BOAC plane. The mystery and confusion will protect us until we are well within Soviet territory and then, of course, we shall have disappeared without trace.”

To Bond there had been nothing fantastic, nothing impossible about Goldfinger since he had heard the details of Operation Grand Slam. The theft of a Stratocruiser, as Goldfinger had explained it, was preposterous, but no more so than his methods of smuggling gold, his purchase of an atomic warhead. When one examined these things, while they had a touch of magic, of genius even, they were logical exercises. They were bizarre only in their magnitude. Even the tiny manoeuvre of cheating Mr Du Pont had been quite brilliantly contrived. There was no doubt about it, Goldfinger was an artist—a scientist in crime as great in his field as Cellini or Einstein in theirs.

“And now, Mr Bond of the British Secret Service, we made a bargain. What have you to tell me? Who put you on to me? What did they suspect? How did you manage to interfere with my plans?”Goldfinger sat back, placed his hands across his stomach and looked at the ceiling.

Bond gave Goldfinger a censored version of the truth. He mentioned nothing about SMERSH or the location of the postbox and he said nothing about the secrets of the Homer, a device that might be new to the Russians. He concluded, “So you see, Goldfinger, you only just got away. But for Tilly Masterton’s intervention at Geneva, you’d have been in the bag by now. You’d be sitting picking your teeth in a Swiss prison waiting to be sent to England. You underestimate the English. They may be slow, but they get there. You think you’ll be pretty safe in Russia? I wouldn’t be too sure. We’ve got people even out of there before now. I’ll give you one last aphorism for your book, Goldfinger, ‘Never go a bear of England.’”





CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE T.L.C. TREATMENT


THE PLANE throbbed on, high above the weather, over the great moonlit landscape. The lights had been turned out. Bond sat quietly in the darkness and sweated with fear at what he was going to do.

An hour before, the girl had brought him dinner. There was a pencil hidden in the napkin. She had made some tough remarks for the benefit of Oddjob and gone away. Bond had eaten some scraps of food and drunk a good deal of bourbon while his imagination hunted round the plane wondering what he could conceivably do to force an emergency landing at Gander or somewhere else in Nova Scotia. As a last resort, could he set fire to the plane? He toyed with the idea, and with the possibility of forcing the entrance hatch open. Both ideas, seemed impracticable and suicidal. To save him the trouble of pondering over them, the man whom Bond had seen before at the BO AC ticket counter, one of the Germans, came through and stopped by Bond’s chair.

He grinned down at Bond. “BOAC takes good care of you, isn’t it? Mister Goldfinger thinks you might have foolish notions. I am to keep an eye on the rear of the plane. So just sit back and enjoy the ride, isn’t it?”

When Bond didn’t answer, the man went on back to the rear section.

Something was nagging at Bond’s mind, something connected with his previous thoughts. That business about forcing the hatch. Now what was it that had happened to that plane, flying over Persia back in ’57? Bond sat for a while and stared with wide, unseeing eyes at the back of the seat in front of him. It might work！It just conceivably might！

Bond wrote on the inside of the napkin, “I’ll do my best. Fasten your seat belt. XXX. J.”

When the girl came to take his tray Bond dropped the napkin and then picked it up and handed it to her. He held her hand and smiled up into the searching eyes. She bent to pick up the tray. She kissed him quickly on the cheek. She straightened herself. She said toughly, “I’ll see you in my dreams, Handsome,”and went off to the galley.

And now Bond’s mind was made up. He had worked out exactly what had to be done. The inches had been measured, the knife from his heel was under his coat and he had twisted the longest end of his seat belt round his left wrist. All he needed was one sign that Oddjob’s body was turned away from the window. It would be too much to expect Oddjob to go to sleep, but at least he could make himself comfortable. Bond’s eyes never left the dim profile he could see reflected in the Perspex oblong of the window of the seat in front, but Oddjob sat stolidly under the reading light he had prudently kept burning, his eyes staring at the ceiling, his mouth slightly open and his hands held ready and relaxed on the arms of his chair.

One hour, two hours. Bond began to snore, rhythmically, drowsily, he hoped hypnotically. Now Oddjob’s hands had moved to his lap. The head nodded once and pulled itself up, shifted to get more comfortable, turned away from the piercing eye of light in the wall, rested on its left cheek away from the window！

Bond kept his snores exactly even. Getting under the Korean’s guard would be as difficult as getting past a hungry mastiff. Slowly, inch by inch, he crouched forward on the balls of his feet and reached with his knife hand between the wall and Oddjob’s seat. Now his hand was there. Now the needle-sharp tip of the dagger was aimed at the centre of the square inch of Perspex he had chosen. Bond grasped the end of his seat belt tightly in his hand, drew the knife back two inches and lunged.

Bond had had no idea what would happen when he cut through the window. All he knew from the Press reports of the Persian case was that the suction out of the pressurized cabin had whirled the passenger next to the window out through the window and into space. Now, as he whipped back his dagger, there was a fantastic howl, almost a scream of air, and Bond was sucked violently against the back of Oddjob’s seat with a force that tore the end of the seat belt from his hand. Over the back of the seat he witnessed a miracle. Oddjob’s body seemed to elongate towards the howling black aperture. There was a crash as his head went through and his shoulders hit the frame. Then, as if the Korean’s body was toothpaste, it was slowly, foot by foot, sucked with a terrible whistling noise through the aperture. Now Oddjob was out to his waist. Now the huge buttocks stuck and the human paste moved only inch by inch. Then, with a loud boom, the buttocks got through and the legs disappeared as if shot from a gun.

After that came the end of the world. With an appalling crash of crockery from the galley, the huge plane stood on its nose and dived. The last thing Bond knew before he blacked out was the high scream of the engines through the open window and a fleeting vision of pillows and rugs whipping out into space past his eyes. Then, with a final desperate embrace of the seat in front, Bond’s oxygen-starved body collapsed in a sear of lung pain.

The next thing Bond felt was a hard kick in the ribs. There was a taste of blood in his mouth. He groaned. Again the foot smashed into his body. Painfully he dragged himself to his knees between the seats and looked up through a red film. All the lights were on. There was a thin mist in the cabin. The sharp depressurization had brought the air in the cabin down below the dew-point. The roar of the engines through the open window was gigantic. An icy wind seared him. Goldfinger stood over him, his face fiendish under the yellow light. There was a small automatic dead steady in his hand. Goldfinger reached back his foot and kicked again. Bond lit with a blast of hot rage. He caught the foot and twisted it sharply, almost breaking the ankle. There came a scream from Goldfinger and a crash that shook the plane. Bond leapt for the aisle and threw himself sideways and down on to the heap of body. There was an explosion that burned the side of his face. But then his knee thudded into Goldfinger’s groin and his left hand was over the gun.

For the first time in his life, Bond went berserk. With his fists and knees he pounded the struggling body while again and again he crashed his forehead down on to the glistening face. The gun came quavering towards him again. Almost indifferently Bond slashed sideways with the edge of his hand and heard the clatter of metal among the seats. Now Goldfinger’s hands were at his throat and Bond’s at Goldfinger’s. Down, down went Bond’s thumbs into the arteries. He threw all his weight forward, gasping for breath. Would he black out before the other man died? Would he? Could he stand the pressure of Goldfinger’s strong hands? The glistening moon-face was changing. Deep purple showed through the tan. The eyes began to nicker up. The pressure of the hands on Bond’s throat slackened. The hands fell away. Now the tongue came out and lolled from the open mouth and there came a terrible gargling from deep in the lungs. Bond sat astride the silent chest and slowly, one by one, unhinged his rigid fingers.

Bond gave a deep sigh and knelt and then stood slowly up. Dazedly he looked up and down the lighted plane. By the galley, Pussy Galore lay strapped in her seat like a heap of washing. Farther down, in the middle of the aisle, the guard lay spreadeagled, one arm and the head at ridiculous angles. Without a belt to hold him when the plane dived, he must have been tossed at the roof like a rag doll.

Bond brushed his hands over his face. Now he felt the burns on his palm and cheeks. Wearily he went down on his knees again and searched for the little gun. It was a Colt—25 automatic. He flicked out the magazine. Three rounds left and one in the chamber. Bond half walked, half felt his way down the aisle to where the girl lay. He unbuttoned her jacket and put his hand against her warm breast. The heart fluttered like a pigeon under his palm. He undid the seat belt and got the girl face down on the floor and knelt astride her. For five minutes he pumped rhythmically at her lungs. When she began to moan, he got up and left her and went on down the aisle and took a fully loaded Luger out of the dead guard’s shoulder holster. On the way back past the shambles of the galley he saw an unbroken bottle of bourbon rolling gently to and fro among the wreckage. He picked it up and pulled the cork and tilted it into his open mouth. The liquor burned like disinfectant. He put the cork back and went forward. He stopped for a minute outside the cockpit door, thinking. Then, with a gun in each hand, he knocked the lever down and went through.

The five faces, blue in the instrument lights, turned towards him. The mouths made black holes and the eyes glinted white. Here the roar of the engines was less. There was a smell of fright-sweat and cigarette smoke. Bond stood with his legs braced, the guns held unwavering. He said, “Goldfinger’s dead. If anyone moves or disobeys an order I shall kill him. Pilot, what’s your position, course, height and speed?”The pilot swallowed. He had to gather saliva before he could speak. He said, “Sir, we are about five hundred miles east of Goose Bay. Mr Goldfinger said we would ditch the plane as near the coast north of there as we could get. We were to reassemble at Montreal and Mr Goldfinger said we would come back and salvage the gold. Our ground speed is two hundred and fifty miles per hour and our height two thousand.”

“How much flying can you do at that altitude? You must be using up fuel pretty fast.”

“Yes, sir. I estimate that we have about two hours left at this height and speed.”

“Get me a time signal.”The navigator answered quickly, “Just had one from Washington, sir. Five minutes to five am. Dawn at this level will be in about an hour.”

“Where is Weathership Charlie?”

“About three hundred miles to the north-east, sir.”

“Pilot, do you think you can make Goose Bay?”

“No, sir, by about a hundred miles. We can only make the coast north of there.”

“Right. Alter course for Weathership Charlie. Operator, call them up and give me the mike.”

“Yes, sir.”

While the plane executed a wide curve, Bond listened to the static and broken snatches of voice that sounded from the amplifier above his head.

The operator’s voice came softly to him, “Ocean Station Charlie. This is Speedbird 510. G-ALGY calling C for Charlie, G-ALGY calling Charlie, G-ALGY…”

A sharp voice broke in. “G-ALGY give your position. G-ALGY give your position. This is Gander Control. Emergency. G-ALGY……”

London came over faintly. An excited voice began chattering. Now voices were coming at them from all directions. Bond could imagine the fix being quickly co-ordinated at all flying control stations, the busy men under the arcs working on the big plot, telephones being lifted, urgent voices talking to each other across the world. The strong signal of Gander Control smothered all other transmissions. “We’ve located G-ALGY. We’ve got them at about 50 N by 70 E. All stations stop transmitting. Priority. I repeat, we have a fix on G-ALGY…”

Suddenly the quiet voice of C for Charlie came in. “This is Ocean Station Charlie calling Speedbird 510. Charlie calling G-ALGY. Can you hear me? Come in Speedbird 510.”

Bond slipped the small gun into his pocket and took the offered microphone. He pressed the transmitter switch and talked quietly into it, watching the crew over the oblong of plastic.

“C for Charlie this is G-ALGY Speedbird hi-jacked last evening at Idlewild. I have killed the man responsible and partly disabled the plane by depressurizing the cabin. I have the crew at gunpoint. Not enough fuel to make Goose so propose to ditch as close to you as possible. Please put line of flares.”

A new voice, a voice of authority, perhaps the captain’s, came over the air. “Speedbird this is C for Charlie. Your message heard and understood. Identify the speaker. I repeat identify the speaker over.”

Bond said and smiled at the sensation his words would cause, “Speedbird to C for Charlie. This is British Secret Service agent Number 007, I repeat Number 007. Whitehall Radio will confirm. I repeat check with Whitehall Radio over.”There was a stunned pause. Voices from round the world tried to break in. Some control, presumably Gander, cleared them off the air. C for Charlie came back, “Speedbird this is C for Charlie alias the Angel Gabriel speaking okay I’ll check with Whitehall and Wilco the flares but London and Gander want more details…”

Bond broke in, “Sorry C for Charlie but I can’t hold five men in my sights and make polite conversation just give me the sea conditions would you and then I’m going off the air till we come in to ditch over.”

“Okay Speedbird I see the point wind here force two sea conditions long smooth swell no broken crests you should make it okay I’ll soon have you on the radar and we’ll keep constant watch on your wavelength have whisky for one and iroas for five waiting good luck over.”

Bond said, “Thanks C for Charlie add a cup of tea to that order would you I’ve got a pretty girl on board this is Speed-bird saying over and out.”

Bond released the switch and handed the microphone to the radio officer. He said, “Pilot, they’re putting down flares and keeping constant watch on our wavelength. Wind force two, long smooth swell with no broken crests. Now take it easy and let’s try and get out of this alive. As soon as we hit the water I’ll get the hatch open. Until then if anyone comes through the cockpit door he gets shot. Right?”

The girl’s voice sounded from the door behind Bond. “I was just coming to join the party but I won’t now. Getting shot doesn’t agree with me. But you might call that man back and make it two whiskies. Tea makes me hiccup.”

Bond said, “Pussy, get back to your basket.”He gave a last glance round the cockpit and backed out of the door.

Two hours, two years, later Bond was lying in the warm cabin in Weathership Charlie listening dreamily to an early morning radio programme from Canada. Various parts of his body ached. He had got to the tail of the plane and made the girl kneel down with her head cradled in her arms on the seat of a chair. Then he had wedged himself in behind and over her and had held her life-jacketed body tightly in his arms and braced his back against the back of the seat behind him.

She had been nervously making facetious remarks about the indelicacy of this position when the belly of the Strato-cruiser had thudded into the first mountain of swell at a hundred miles an hour. The huge plane skipped once and then crashed nose first into a wall of water. The impact had broken the back of the plane. The leaden weight of the bullion in the baggage compartment had torn the plane in half, spewing Bond and the girl out into the icy swell, lit red by the line of flares. There they had floated, half stunned, in their yellow life-jackets until the lifeboat got to them. By then there were only a few chunks of wreckage on the surface and the crew, with three tons of gold round their necks, were on their way down to the bed of the Atlantic. The boat hunted for ten minutes but when no bodies came to the surface they gave up the search and chugged back up the searchlight beam to the blessed wall of iron of the old frigate.

They had been treated like a mixture of royally and people from Mars. Bond had answered the first, most urgent questions and then it had all suddenly seemed to be too much for his tired mind to cope with. Now he was lying luxuriating in the peace and the heat of the whisky and wondering about Pussy Galore and why she had chosen shelter under his wing rather than under Goldfinger’s.

The connecting door with the next cabin opened and the girl came in. She was wearing nothing but a grey fisherman’s jersey that was decent by half an inch. The sleeves were rolled up. She looked like a painting by Vertes. She said, “People keep on asking if I’d like an alcohol rub and I keep on saying that if anyone’s going to rub me it’s you, and if I’m going to be rubbed with anything it’s you I’d like to be rubbed with.”She ended lamely, “So here I am.”

Bond said firmly, “Lock that door, Pussy, take off that sweater and come into bed. You’ll catch cold.”

She did as she was told, like an obedient child.

She lay in the crook of Bond’s arm and looked up at him. She said, not in a gangster’s voice, or a Lesbian’s, but in a girl’s voice, Will you write to me in Sing Sing?”

Bond looked down into the deep blue-violet eyes that were no longer hard, imperious. He bent and kissed them lightly. He said, “They told me you only liked women.”

She said, “I never met a man before.”The toughness came back into her voice. “I come from the South. You know the definition of a virgin down there? Well, it’s a girl who can run faster than her brother. In my case I couldn’t run as fast as my uncle. I was twelve. That’s not so good, James. You ought to be able to guess that.”

Bond smiled down into the pale, beautiful face. He said, “All you need is a course of TLC.”

“What’s TLC?”

“Short for Tender Loving Care treatment. It’s what they write on most papers when a waif gets brought in to a children’s clinic.”

“I’d like that.”She looked at the passionate, rather cruel mouth waiting above hers. She reached up and brushed back the comma of black hair that had fallen over his right eyebrow. She looked into the fiercely slitted grey eyes. “When’s it going to start?”

Bond’s right hand came slowly up the firm, muscled thighs, over the flat soft plain of the stomach to the right breast. Its point was hard with desire. He said softly, “Now.”His mouth came ruthlessly down on hers.
