我就在你身旁！夜色如此温柔……

可惜周围不见光亮，

只有一线微光来自天上，

随着轻风穿过幽暗朦胧的树丛和布满青苔的曲径。

译者序


菲茨杰拉德（1896—1940）是美国著名作家，他的小说《了不起的盖茨比》和《夜色温柔》曾经震撼了世界文坛，也给读者留下了深刻的印象。

菲茨杰拉德小时候就喜欢文学，试写过剧本。1913年，他就读普林斯顿大学，在校期间醉心于文学，对自己所学的科目并不上心，常常缺课，好几门课程的考试都不及格，对此，任课老师颇有微词。对于文学创作他情有独钟，参加了学校的文学团体，创作了喜剧《邪恶之眼》。在校方的眼里，他是个不务正业的“竖子”，所以尽管他的《邪恶之眼》由学生剧团在美国各地巡回演出，校方也不允许他参演，以示警诫。1917年春，美国宣布参加第一次世界大战，他报名参军，打算为国效力，谁知未等他上战场杀敌，战争便结束了，他的报国情怀化为空梦。

1920年，他出版了长篇小说《人间天堂》，一炮打响。此后，他又接连出版了长篇小说《漂亮冤家》、《了不起的盖茨比》和《夜色温柔》。特别是后两部小说的出版更是“一石激起千层浪”，非但在美国走红一时，也成为世界各国脍炙人口的小说。因为它们反映了战后青年一代的迷茫，揭示了普遍存在于人们心底的困惑。此外，他还出版了短篇小说集《爵士时代的故事》《所有悲伤的年轻人》以及散文集《崩溃》等。

菲茨杰拉德成名后仍笔耕不辍，但可惜他的妻子并不是所谓的“贤内助”，而是一个挥霍无度、心胸狭窄的人，非但不欣赏他的成功，反而有些嫉妒，久而久之竟因心胸狭窄精神失常。妻子患病，家里经济拮据，陷入了入不敷出的窘境，他走投无路，只好“闯荡”好莱坞，写一些文学价值不大的剧本赚钱贴补家用。家庭的不幸使他几乎无法创作，精神濒于崩溃，终日酗酒。1940年12月21日，他猝发心脏病，死于洛杉矶，时年仅四十四岁。其实，他去世之前家中已一贫如洗，于是他留下遗嘱要求举办“最便宜的葬礼”。妻子虽然给他带来了无尽的苦难，但他永远忘不了婚前他追求她的热情以及山盟海誓，忘不了二人在一起度过的艰难岁月，因而他在遗嘱里还要求在他们合葬墓的墓碑上镌刻《了不起的盖茨比》中的最后一段话：“我们奋力向前，但无异于逆水行舟，最终又回到了往昔岁月。”

菲茨杰拉德离开了人世，但是他的作品却如青山常在，在一代又一代人的心中激起了情感的波澜，使得人们对他久久难以忘怀，或者说永铭不忘。1996年，他一百周年诞辰时，美国文学界为他举办了声势浩大的纪念活动，在全美国乃至全世界又一次掀起了“菲茨杰拉德热”。意大利等国家也举办活动，纪念这位英年早逝的文学奇才。

海明威是菲茨杰拉德的好友，也是他的崇拜者，说他是世界文坛上不可多得的人才。两个人在巴黎漂泊的时候朝夕相处，留下了许多佳话。[1]我国著名作家张爱玲对他更是青睐有加，曾写过这样一段文字：“菲茨杰拉德是我最推崇的美国作家，他是个天才，写作技巧高超，他的作品有强烈的时代特性，叙述清晰，文风优雅，词句多姿多彩。”

菲茨杰拉德的小说之所以令人难忘，主要因为他的每部作品都很“特别”，非但写作风格与众不同，书中的每个人物也都很“特别”，个个都有自己的思想世界，人人都有自己独具一格的“情怀”，表现出强烈的“对比感”和“冲突感”（在人类的世界中，实际情况无不如此！）。在他的作品里，处处可见他面对现实时所表现出的犹豫和彷徨，看得出他对美好事物的憧憬和赞美，还看得出他面对社会的阴暗面以及人性中邪恶的一面时心里所产生的憎恶以及沉痛的反思。

斯人已逝，但他的呐喊犹如警钟，在我们的耳畔一声声鸣响……

第一篇


第一章


在风光旖旎的法国里维埃拉[1]海岸上，在大约位于马赛[2]与意大利边境的正中间，有一座高大气派、玫瑰色的旅馆。挺拔的棕榈树为富丽堂皇的旅馆遮出一片阴凉，旅馆门前有一小片沙滩，亮得有点刺眼。近来，这里成了名流显贵的避暑胜地。十年前，英国房客在四月间去了北方，旅馆几乎可以说是人去楼空。如今，旅馆附近冒出了许多平房。不过，本故事开始的时候，周围也只有十几幢旧别墅，它们的圆顶破败得就像高斯外乡人旅馆与五英里开外的戛纳[3]之间那片茂密的松树林中的睡莲。

这家旅馆与它门前那片亮棕色跪毯一般的沙滩浑然一体。清晨，远处戛纳的城市轮廓、粉红与浅黄相间的古老城堡以及法意边界那绛紫色的阿尔卑斯山倒映在水面上，在清澈的浅水里随着海生植物摇曳出的涟漪和细浪微微颤抖着。还不到八点钟，就见一个男子身穿蓝色浴衣跑到了沙滩上，先把清凉的海水撩泼在身上，嘴里哼哼唧唧，大口喘着粗气，随后下水胡乱游了一阵。他离去后，沙滩与海湾又安静了一个小时。在这段时间里，远处的海面上商船缓缓西行；餐厅侍者在旅馆的院子里大声说话；松树上的露水已经消失。又过了一个小时，摩尔人[4]居住过的那片丘陵地带蜿蜒的公路上才有汽车喇叭声传来——那片丘陵从中间将沿海地区与真正的普罗旺斯[5]分开。

离海边一英里远的地方，松树让位给了落满灰尘的杨树，那儿有一个孤零零的铁路小站。一九二五年六月的一个早晨，一辆四轮折篷马车载着一对母女从这个铁路小站向高斯旅馆驶来。母亲虽风韵犹存，但脸上用不了多久便会出现细碎的皱纹。她的神态安详而敏锐，让人觉得舒心。不过，看她的人很快就会将目光转向她的女儿，后者有一双具有魔力的粉色小手，脸上泛着红晕，就像小孩子傍晚洗过冷水浴后那般红扑扑的，煞是可爱。她漂亮的前额缓缓地倾斜至发际线，一头秀发像波浪一样卷着，浅褐色和金色的发卷又似一面带纹章的盾牌挡在额头上。她那双水汪汪的大眼睛清澈明亮，闪烁着光芒，两个脸蛋上的红晕自然天成——那是她强有力的、年轻的心脏酿成的红晕。她的体态微妙地停留在孩提时期的最后阶段——她年近十八岁，已经快成人了，但身上仍带着一股清纯劲儿。

远处海天连成一线出现在她们脚下——那是一条细细的、灼热的线。

只听母亲说道：“不知怎么，我觉得咱们不会喜欢这地方的。”

“我现在就有点想回家了。”女儿说。

母女俩闲聊着，语气轻松，但漫无边际，乏味无聊，似乎她们对任何话题都不感兴趣。她们只想寻求刺激，这倒不是因为精神疲惫需要刺激，而是带着一种得了奖状的学生理应度假，以兹激励的心情。

“咱们住三天就打道回府。我马上拍电报订购船票。”

到了旅馆，女孩用法语订了房间，她的法语不可谓不地道，但缺乏抑扬顿挫，像是在背书。她们被安排在一楼的客房，女孩走到亮堂堂的落地窗前，然后出房间走几步到了与旅馆一般长的石砌游廊上。她走起路来臀部紧绷，腰背挺直，如同一位芭蕾舞演员。游廊外阳光炽热，她的影子也变得很短，光线强得让她几乎睁不开眼，使得她连连后退。五十码开外，地中海似乎也禁不住骄阳的照射，一点点在褪色。游廊的栏杆下方，一辆褪色的别克汽车停在旅馆的车道上，遭受着酷热阳光的炙烤。

说实在的，这个地方只有沙滩上还有点人气。三个英国保姆坐在那儿编织着很费功夫的维多利亚式样的毛衣和毛袜，这种式样曾流行于十九世纪的四十、六十和八十年代。她们一边编织一边张家长李家短地说着咒语般的悄悄话。紧靠海边，有十多个人在条纹遮阳伞下安营扎寨，而他们的孩子或在浅水区追逐那些不怕人的鱼儿，或赤条条地躺在沙滩上，涂满椰子油的身体在阳光下闪闪发亮。

这个叫罗斯玛丽的女孩来到沙滩上，一个十二岁的小男孩从她身边跑过，兴奋地大叫着扑进了海水里。她感觉那些陌生人在用灼人的目光打量她，于是急忙脱下浴衣跳进了水中。她脸朝下游了几码，发现水很浅，便摇晃了几下站住了，然后迈开细细的腿，顶着水的阻力吃力地朝前蹚，腿沉甸甸的，像绑了沙袋一样。走到海水齐胸深的地方，她回头向沙滩上望了一眼，见那儿有个秃头男子在目不转睛地盯着她看——那男子戴着单片眼镜，穿一条紧身裤，挺着毛茸茸的胸脯，丑陋的肚脐朝下凹陷。那男子见罗斯玛丽在回头看他，便摘下眼镜，随手往那团滑稽的胸毛中一塞，然后举起手中的瓶子给自己倒了一杯饮料。

罗斯玛丽把脸贴在水面上，四肢并用，以狗刨式朝救生筏游去。海水涌过来，轻轻地将她往水中拉，让她离开热气。海水浸湿了她的头发，淹没了她的全身。她在水里左右打转，迎着浪花一个劲儿向前游，到救生筏跟前时已累得气喘吁吁。筏子上有个女人，皮肤晒成了古铜色，牙齿雪白，低下头打量着她。罗斯玛丽突然意识到自己的身体是那么白，于是便回过身向岸边游去。她上岸时，那个胸毛浓密的男子拎着饮料瓶走过来搭讪。

“我说，救生筏后边那片水域里有鲨鱼呢。”弄不清他是哪国人，但他讲的英语带着一种慢吞吞的牛津腔，“昨天就有两个英军舰队的水兵在瑞昂湾被鲨鱼吃了。”

“天哪！”罗斯玛丽惊叫了一声。

“都怪军舰上丢进海水里的废弃物把它们引了过来。”

他眼睛无神，让人觉得他只是出于好心提醒一下罗斯玛丽，说完就迈着碎步走开了，没走两步就又给自己倒了一杯饮料。

二人说话间，罗斯玛丽觉得一些人在拿眼偷看她，但心里并不感到讨厌，她想找个地方坐坐。沙滩上每家都有一把遮阳伞，而遮阳伞前边的一小块沙地就是他们的领地，各家之间还相互串门，海阔天空地聊天，呈现出一种社区的气氛，外人随便闯入显然是不明智的。再往前走走，就是一片布满鹅卵石和干枯海藻的海滩了，那儿有一些人皮肤跟她一样白，他们躺在小号的便携式遮阳伞下面，而非沙滩遮阳伞，显然不像是本地人。罗斯玛丽在古铜色皮肤的人群和白皮肤人群之间找了块空地，把她的浴衣铺在沙子上。

她躺在沙滩上，起先听到的是他们的说话声，后来感到他们在她身边走动，他们的影子在阳光下晃动。一条好奇的小狗跑过来，呼出的热气吹到她脖子上，让她感到痒痒的。阳光下，她觉得皮肤有点发烫，还听见涌上沙滩的海浪退回大海时发出低沉、疲倦的哗哗声。此时，她已经能分辨出不同的说话者了，而且听出有人在讲述昨晚发生在戛纳的一桩绑架案，说绑架者劫走了一个咖啡馆侍者，声称要把他锯成两段。讲述人是个白头发的夫人，不屑地将绑架者称为“北方佬”。这位夫人穿一身晚礼服，显然是昨晚穿的，还没有脱下来，仍戴着冠状头饰，肩上还别着一朵枯萎的兰花，蔫了吧唧的。罗斯玛丽对她以及她的同伴们隐约有些反感，便转过了身去。

她的另一边，最靠近她的是一位年轻女子，躺在一把遮阳伞下，正对着沙地上一本摊开的书开列清单。那女子穿着泳衣，袒露出肩膀和背脊，皮肤红润，呈橘红色，脖子上戴一串乳白色珍珠项链，项链在阳光下闪闪发光。她一脸严肃，面容秀丽，让人怜爱。她与罗斯玛丽目光相遇，然而并没有特别注意罗斯玛丽。她身旁是个头戴轻便鸭舌帽、身穿红条紧身衣的英俊男子。再下来就是罗斯玛丽见过的那个救生筏上的女子，那女子回过头来看着罗斯玛丽。再远一些，可以看见一个瘦长脸男子，蓬松着一头金发，身穿蓝色紧身衣，没戴帽子，正神情严肃地同一位穿黑色紧身衣、显然是拉丁裔的小伙子说话，他们边说边捡拾沙滩上一小片一小片的海藻叶。罗斯玛丽觉得他们很可能是美国人，可又与她近来结识的那些美国人有所不同。

过了一会儿，她才意识到那个戴轻便鸭舌帽的男子原来正在为这个小团体悄声静气地表演一个小节目。他煞有其事地在用耙子耙着什么，似乎在清除沙砾，一脸严肃，然而却产生了发人深省的喜剧效果。他的表演令人喷饭，每说一句话都会引来一串笑声。就连像罗斯玛丽这样身在远处的人，虽听不清他在说什么，也把目光转了过去。最后，海滩上除了那个戴珍珠项链的年轻女子，所有的人都在关注他的表演。也许是出于自制和矜持吧，众人越是那般笑闹，该女子越是专注于她的清单。

就在这时，那个戴着单片眼镜、手拎饮料瓶的男子不知从哪儿冒了出来，冷不丁对罗斯玛丽说道：“你游泳游得棒极了！”

罗斯玛丽说他过奖了。

“真的很棒。我叫坎皮恩。这里有一位夫人说她上星期在索伦托[6]见过你，知道你是谁，很想同你见见面。”

罗斯玛丽压下心中的不快，回头看见那群未被晒黑的人正等着她过去，于是便不情愿地站起身朝他们走去。

“这位是艾布拉姆斯夫人。这是米基思科夫人和米基思科先生。这位是邓弗里先生。”

“我们知道你是谁，”那个身穿晚礼服的夫人说道，“你是罗斯玛丽·霍伊特。我在索伦托认出了你，还向旅馆服务生打听过你的情况。我们都认为你的表演美妙绝伦，不知你为何不回到美国去再拍一部好影片。”

那几个人言语夸张，很是夸奖了她一番。那个认出她的夫人尽管不是犹太人，却有一个犹太人的名字。她称得上“老当益壮”，不受阅历的影响，能够不拘一格地同年轻人打成一片。

“我们要给你个忠告，不要刚来就暴晒。”她兴致勃勃地继续说道，“你的皮肤可是很重要的。在这沙滩上晒太阳似乎有许多讲究，不知你是否介意。”





第二章


“依我们看，你可能最有戏。”米基思科夫人说道。她是个眼神犀利但长得水灵的年轻女子，带着一种盛气凌人的姿态。“不过，谁有没有戏，我们也不甚了了。我老公最看重一个演员，认为他是个大牌演员，实际上却是个跑龙套的。”

“什么戏？”罗斯玛丽有点不解地问，“这里在拍戏吗？”

“亲爱的，我们哪里知道，”艾布拉姆斯夫人咯咯一笑说，胖胖的身子也跟着抖了抖，“我们都是外行，只会看热闹。”

邓弗里先生是个浅黄色头发、有些女气的青年，这时他在一旁说道：“艾布拉姆斯妈妈自己就是一台戏。”坎皮恩把拿在手里的眼镜冲着他点了点，说：“喂，罗亚尔，别瞎扯了。”罗斯玛丽不快地看着他们，心想要是自己的母亲在身边就好了。她不喜欢这些人，尤其是跟沙滩另一端曾叫她感兴趣的那几个人一比，就更不喜欢了。母亲和蔼可亲，善于随机应变，如果她在跟前，很快就可以使她们母女摆脱这种不尴不尬的境地。而罗斯玛丽则不然——她出名才六个月，再加上早期养成的那种法国人的处事方法和美国的民主作风交织在一起，对她产生了深刻影响，使得她无法摆脱眼前的困境。

米基思科先生是个已入而立之年的男子，骨瘦如柴，脸上有雀斑和红点。他觉得“有戏没戏”这个话题索然无味，一直在眺望大海，此时他飞快地扫了妻子一眼，转身面对罗斯玛丽，唐突地问道：“到这儿很久了吗？”

“刚来一天。”

“噢。”

显然，他觉得就这么突兀地转了话题有些不妥，便逐个观察了一下另外几个人的脸色。

“要待上一夏天吗？”米基思科夫人毫不在意地问，“要是你在这儿待下去，你就有戏看了。”

“看在上帝的分上，维奥莉特，你就别揪住这个话题不放了！看在上帝的分上，你能不能说点别的！”她丈夫吼道。

米基思科夫人转向艾布拉姆斯夫人，气得直喘粗气，说道：“他太激动了。”

“我没有激动，”米基思科反驳道，“实际上，我一点儿也不激动。”

他分明很恼火，气得脸色发青，这叫他的辩解显得苍白无力。突然，他意识到了这一点，觉得有些难为情，便起身向海边走去，他的妻子紧随其后。罗斯玛丽也趁机跟了上去。

米基思科深深吸了口气，扎进浅浅的海水里，双臂僵硬地拍打着地中海的海水，显然自以为游的是自由式，等一口气用完时，他抬头回望，发现自己离海岸没有多远，不由得露出了惊讶的表情。

“我还没有学会换气。我弄不清楚他们是怎么换气的。”他脸上带着探询的表情，看着罗斯玛丽说。

“我想你要学会在水下吐气，”她对他讲解道，“每划四下水，你就侧过头来换口气。”

“对我来说，换气最难学了。我们到救生筏那儿去，好吗？”

那个头发蓬松的男子四仰八叉地躺在救生筏上，而那筏子随着海浪的波动一摇一晃的。米基思科夫人游了过去，谁知这时筏身猛然一晃，重重地撞了她的胳膊一下。那个男子一个鲤鱼打挺跳起来，将她拉了上去。

“恐怕撞着你了吧？”他说话慢声慢气，还有点害羞。他有一张罗斯玛丽所见过的最忧伤的脸，颧骨高高的，像印第安人一样，上嘴唇厚厚的，深深的眼窝里嵌着一双暗金色的大眼睛。说话时，他的声音从嘴角发出，仿佛想让他说的话以一种迂回而不冒昧的方式传到米基思科夫人的耳朵里。一眨眼，他便跃入了水中，面向岸边伸展开长长的身子一动不动。

罗斯玛丽和米基思科夫人看着他。等跳入水中的那股冲力耗尽后，他突然弓起身来，细瘦的大腿伸出水面，随后不见了人影，几乎连个水泡都没有留下。

“他游泳游得真好。”罗斯玛丽说。

米基思科夫人的评价却叫她感到意外。

只听前者说道：“是吗？他可是个蹩脚的音乐家哟。”她转向她的丈夫，她的丈夫想爬上筏子，两次都没有成功，这时好不容易才爬了上来，摆动着手臂试图保持平衡，却踉跄了几步。她对丈夫解释道：“刚才正说阿贝·诺思呢——他也许游泳游得很好，但音乐方面却很糟糕。”

“是的。”米基思科哼唧了一声表示同意。显而易见，他给妻子规定的范围很狭窄，只允许她在这范围之内享有一丁点自由。

“安太尔[7]跟我很熟。”米基思科夫人挑战似的对罗斯玛丽说，“安太尔和乔伊斯[8]我都熟悉。我猜想你在好莱坞没怎么听说过这些人。乔伊斯的《尤利西斯》一进入美国，第一篇评论文章就是出自我丈夫的手笔。”

“真希望能抽根烟，现在这比什么都重要。”米基思科平静地说。

“乔伊斯的作品很有内涵。是不是，艾伯特？”

米基思科夫人说着，突然没了声音。只见那个戴珍珠项链的女子也来到了水里，同她的两个孩子会合。此时，阿贝·诺思从水下像一座火山岛似的冒出来，将其中一个孩子举起放在自己肩上。这孩子既害怕又高兴，大喊大叫，而戴项链的女子在一旁看着，一脸的恬静，脸上并无笑容。

“那个女的是他妻子吗？”罗斯玛丽问。

“不是。她是戴弗夫人。他们不住在这家旅馆。”米基思科夫人说话时，眼睛一直盯着那个女子的脸，一刻也没有离开过。过了一会儿，她猛地转向罗斯玛丽问：“你以前到过国外吗？”

“到过，我是在巴黎上的学。”

“是吗？那你大概很清楚：要想在这儿过得开心，就得认识几个巴黎的名流。那些人会有什么名堂呢？”米基思科夫人把左肩膀朝岸上耸了耸说，“他们只会抱团取暖，在小圈子里转悠。当然，我们是有推荐信的，这才得以在巴黎结识艺术和文学界的翘楚。这样，我们就如鱼得水了。”

“想必也是。”

“你可知道，我丈夫就要写完他的第一部小说了。”

罗斯玛丽说：“噢，是吗？”她有点心不在焉，只在担心这么热的天她母亲是不是能睡得着觉。

“这部小说在叙事方法上有点像《尤利西斯》，只不过反映的不是二十四小时之内的事，而是百年沧桑，把一个古老、颓败的法国贵族家族放进大机器时代进行比较……”米基思科夫人说。

“天呀，看在上帝的分上，维奥莉特，你别逢人就说，好不好？”米基思科提出了抗议，“我可不想还没等书出版就闹得满城风雨。”

罗斯玛丽游回岸边，把浴巾披到发酸的肩膀上，再次躺下来晒太阳。那个戴轻便鸭舌帽的男子手里拿着一瓶酒和几只玻璃杯，从这把遮阳伞走到那把遮阳伞。不一会儿，他和他的朋友们玩得更热闹、凑得更近了，最后索性把所有的伞聚在一起，大家都钻到了伞下。罗斯玛丽猜想他们可能在为什么人送行，来到沙滩上聚会畅饮。就连孩子们也知道沙滩上的欢声笑语来自那片伞下，于是转身朝那边张望。在罗斯玛丽看来，唱主角的是那个戴轻便鸭舌帽的男子。

中午时分，大海和天空热气蒸腾，甚至五英里之外白带子般的戛纳市的轮廓也渐渐模糊起来，恍如一个清新、凉爽的幻景。一条类似知更鸟形状的帆船从远处灰暗的海面上驶来，停靠在了这片沙滩近旁的岸边。长长的海岸线上好像到处都死气沉沉的，唯独花花绿绿的遮阳伞下的阴影里才有一点叽叽咕咕的人语声。

坎皮恩朝罗斯玛丽走来，在几步远的地方站住脚。罗斯玛丽正闭眼装睡，这时她把眼睛睁开了一条缝，蒙蒙眬眬地看见面前有两根模糊不清的柱子，其实是坎皮恩的腿。炙热的天空有一块云彩把影子投在了沙滩上，坎皮恩想躲进云影里，可是那块云彩却飘走了。看着看着，罗斯玛丽真的睡着了。

她醒来时全身大汗淋漓，发现海滩上已空空荡荡，只有那个戴轻便鸭舌帽的男子在收最后一把遮阳伞。罗斯玛丽睡眼惺忪地躺着，那人走过来说：“我打算走之前来叫醒你。一下子晒得太过头没有好处。”

“谢谢。”罗斯玛丽说完，低头看见自己的腿已晒成了深红色，不由得叫出了声：“天哪！”

她快活地大笑起来，原想邀他一块聊聊，可这位叫迪克·戴弗的男子已经扛着一顶帐篷和一把海滩遮阳伞转身离去，走向一辆停在远处的汽车。于是，她跳进水里要把身上的汗洗掉。谁知迪克·戴弗又拐了回来，将耙子、铲子和筛子收到一起，塞到一块岩石的裂缝里，然后朝沙滩四下巡视一番，看是否遗漏了什么东西。

“你知道现在几点了吗？”罗斯玛丽问。

“大概一点半了。”

二人面对大海，眺望了一会儿海景。

“现在看海，风景还是不错的。反正此时观海，时间不能算是非常差的。”迪克·戴弗说。

说话时，他眼睛盯着罗斯玛丽。一时间，罗斯玛丽宛如充满渴望且满怀信心地生活在那双蓝晶晶的眼睛所承载的世界里。后来，他扛起最后一包杂物向汽车那儿去了，罗斯玛丽也上了岸，抓起浴衣抖了抖，朝着旅馆走去。





第三章


母女俩走进餐厅时，差不多已下午两点了。一束束光线和阴影构成繁复的图案，投射在空无一人的餐桌上，并跟随外面的松树一起摇曳。两个侍者一边收拾餐具，一边用意大利语大声交谈。她们一进来，那两人便住了口，随即给她们端来一份旅馆常规的午间套餐。

“我在沙滩坠入情网了。”罗斯玛丽说。

“爱上谁了？”

“先爱上的是一大群看上去挺不错的人，后来爱上了一个男子。”

“你跟他说话了吗？”

“只说了几句。他有一头淡红色头发，英俊潇洒。”她狼吞虎咽地吃着饭说，“不过，他已经结婚了——情况往往如此。”

对罗斯玛丽而言，母亲是她最好的朋友，总是全心全意地为她指点迷津，这种情况在演艺界虽说并不罕见，但这位埃尔西·斯皮尔斯夫人的境况却比较特殊——斯皮尔斯夫人如此作为并非为了弥补自身的遗憾。她的人生无怨无恨，经历过两次称心如意的婚姻，又两次守寡，而每一次婚姻都会让她的禁欲主义情感加深一分，并安于这种状况。她的一个丈夫曾当过骑兵军官，另一个是军医。他们对她都有些影响，而她想把这些影响完全施加给罗斯玛丽。她殚精竭虑、满怀热忱，一心要将女儿培养成一个具有理想主义情怀的人，并对女儿的教育一丝不苟，没有丝毫的放松。此时的罗斯玛丽已经具有了这种情怀，并学会了用自己的眼光观察世界。当罗斯玛丽还是个“单纯的”孩子时，就受到了双重保护——一重来自母亲，一重来自她本人的内心深处。她少年老成，不信任那些浅薄、浮夸、庸俗不堪的人。后来，罗斯玛丽在电影界一炮打响，斯皮尔斯夫人觉得该让她在精神层面上断奶了。若这种积极进取、苛刻得叫人有点喘不过气来的理想主义集中到除她自己以外的其他事情上，她会感到高兴，而非痛苦。

“那么，你喜欢这个地方？”她问女儿。

“如果我们能认识那些人，还是挺有意思的。不过，还有一些人就不叫人喜欢了。他们认出了我——不管去哪儿，好像人人都看过《父女情深》这部电影。”

斯皮尔斯夫人等着她这股自负的激情平复下来，然后不紧不慢地说：“噢，这倒提醒了我，你什么时候去看望厄尔·布雷迪？”

“我觉得你要是休息好了的话，今天下午就可以去。”

“你自己去吧，我就不去了。”

“那明天再说吧。”

“我是想让你一个人去。短短的一段路，你又不是不会讲法语。”

“母亲，难道非去不可吗？”

“哦，那好吧，那就另找时间去吧。但离开这里之前必须去一趟。”“好的，母亲。”

午餐后，母女俩都感到一种突如其来的乏味无聊，这是美国人到了海外的一处宁静的地方常有的感觉。在这里，没有工作在激励她们，没有声音在鼓舞她们，脑袋里也不会像其他人那样生出种种想法，这叫她们怀念那个喧嚣热闹的大帝国，觉得这儿的生活像一潭死水。

“在这儿只住三天就可以了，母亲。”母女俩回到客房时，罗斯玛丽这样说道。外边，一阵轻风吹过，携带着发烫的气流穿过树丛，把炎热从百叶窗送进室内。

“你在沙滩爱上的那个男子怎么样？”

“母亲，亲爱的，除了你，我谁都不爱。”

罗斯玛丽来到大厅，向旅馆老板高斯先生打听火车车次的情况。前台的服务生身穿浅褐色卡其制服靠在桌子上，痴呆呆地望着她，后来突然想到自己的职业礼仪，急忙收回了目光。罗斯玛丽坐上汽车，在两个谦卑恭顺的服务员的陪同下去火车站。那两人毕恭毕敬，一言不发，这让她很尴尬，真想对他们说：“放松点，该说什么就说什么，不要管我在不在跟前！”

头等车厢里闷热得像蒸笼，而窗外一望无际的大海一动不动，铁路公司那形象生动的广告招贴——阿尔勒[9]的加尔桥[10]、奥朗日[11]的圆形剧场以及夏慕尼[12]的冬季运动场——要比眼前的大海清新悦目得多。美国的火车风驰电掣，只顾埋头朝前跑，根本瞧不起来自世界另一端的悠闲自在的旅客。此处的火车却不同，完全和窗外的景色融为一体，喷出的气把棕榈树叶子上的灰尘吹得漫天飞舞，烟囱里落下的煤灰同路旁花园里干燥的粪肥混杂在了一起。罗斯玛丽相信，只要她从窗口探出身去，就能把花园里的鲜花摘到手。

戛纳车站外边，十来个出租车司机在他们的车里打瞌睡。远处的海滨大道上，娱乐场、琳琅满目的商店以及气势宏伟的旅馆全都死气沉沉，它们光秃秃的铁门脸都朝着夏日的大海。让人难以置信的是，这儿竟然还会有“社交旺季”。罗斯玛丽有些与社会上的时尚脱节，她自己也心知肚明，她似乎喜欢感伤怀旧，对逝去的繁华表现出不健康的情趣。似乎人们不禁要问：她为什么早不来晚不来，不在去年冬天的社交旺季来，也不等到明年冬天再来，偏偏在这冷冷清清的日子来？岂不知此时的北方繁花似锦，正是社交旺季！

她从药店买了一瓶椰子油出来时，抬头看见一个女子抱着几个沙发垫子从她前面穿过马路，走向一辆停在路边的汽车。她认出那是戴弗夫人。一条瘦长、矮小的黑狗冲着戴弗夫人汪汪汪地叫个不停，把正在打盹儿的司机吓了一跳。戴弗夫人坐到车上，绷着美丽的脸，表情沉着，目光坚毅、警觉，旁若无人地直视前方。她身穿鲜红色的衣服，晒黑的腿裸露在外，头发浓密，呈暗金色，像狮子狗的毛。

火车还得等半个小时，罗斯玛丽来到克鲁瓦塞特海滨大道，走进艾利斯咖啡馆坐了下来。夕阳将一片绿色的树影投射在桌子上，一支管弦乐队在演奏《尼斯[13]狂欢曲》和去年的美国流行歌曲，欢迎着想象中来自世界各地的宾客。她为母亲买了法文的《时报》和英文的《星期六晚邮报》，然后一边喝着柠檬水，一边翻开《星期六晚邮报》，读一位俄国公主的回忆录。她觉得十九世纪九十年代出版的陈旧的回忆录比现在法国报纸上的新闻摘要还要真实，还要贴近人心。在旅馆里读报时，她就有这种感觉，觉得心头有一种压抑感。她尚不具备明辨是非的素质，一看到报上浓墨重彩的关于一个大洲千奇百怪的新闻悲喜剧，她现在已经开始感到厌倦了，觉得法国的生活既空洞又乏味。听着乐队奏出的忧伤的曲调，这种感觉涌上心头，让她想起为歌舞杂耍表演伴奏的那种令人压抑的音乐。她恨不得插翅飞回高斯旅馆去。

肩膀晒得太厉害，第二天她无法再去游泳。来到法国后，她懂得了金钱的分量，跟司机再三讨价，才和母亲雇了辆汽车沿着河网密布的里维埃拉三角洲兜风。那位司机长得很像恐怖的伊凡[14]时代的俄国沙皇，他自告奋勇地充当了导游。于是乎，那些灿烂的名字（戛纳、尼斯、蒙特卡洛[15]）揭开呆板乏味的面具，露出神采奕奕的真面目，诉说着它们辉煌的历史：诸多帝王驻跸于此，或长眠于此；印度酋长面对英国芭蕾舞女心无旁骛，像佛祖一样低垂双目；落魄的俄国王子数周都沉迷于波罗的海的夕阳。沿着海岸线处处可见俄罗斯人留下的遗迹，处处可见他们关闭了的书店和停业的杂货铺。十年前，当旅游季节在四月结束时，东正教教堂便关门上锁，他们把喜欢喝的甜甜的香槟酒贮存起来，待返回时享用。“到下一个旺季，我们就回来。”他们宣称。然而，说这话为时过早，因为他们再也没回来。

傍晚时分驱车返回旅馆，沿途风光叫母女俩心旷神怡——大海上空五彩斑斓，像童话世界里神奇的玛瑙和彩玉，绿如草汁，蓝如洗衣水，暗红如葡萄酒。所过之处，只见农民在家门外吃晚饭，听得到乡村酒吧屋葡萄架后传来尖厉、单调的钢琴声，这一切叫她们心情愉悦。当汽车拐弯离开“金色海滨”，在暮色中穿过绿树成行、芳草连片的堤岸，驰向高斯旅馆时，一轮明月已经悬挂在了罗马水道遗迹的上空……

旅馆后面的某处山坡上在举办舞会，罗斯玛丽睡在蚊帐里，聆听着那从幽灵般的月色里传来的乐声，意识到处处都有欢乐，不由想起了沙滩上遇到的那几位风趣的人物，暗忖明天早晨也许还能见到他们。不过，那几个人显然是一个独立的小王国，一旦撑起遮阳伞，铺上竹席，安顿好狗和孩子，就会扎起禁止入内的围栏。她暗暗下定决心，一定不会跟其他人一起度过这最后的两个上午。





第四章


次日上午，她的问题得到了解决。米基思科夫妇还没有来，她刚把浴衣铺到沙滩上，就见那个戴轻便鸭舌帽的男子和那位高个子金发男子（据说要将侍者锯成两段的就是此人）离开他们的小团体向她走了过来。

“早上好！”迪克·戴弗有些忐忑地说，“唉，不知道你晒坏了没有。你昨天为什么没来？我们在为你担心呢。”

她坐起来，嫣然一笑，对他们表示欢迎。

“今天上午不知你愿意不愿意到我们那儿坐坐？”迪克·戴弗又说道，“我们带的有吃的和喝的，诚恳邀请你加入。”

他显得和蔼可亲，有着迷人的风度，话语中包含着对她的关心。他一定会关照她的，马上就会为她打开一个全新的世界，展现出无穷无尽壮丽的前景。他介绍她时不提她的名字，完全尊重她的隐私，却轻而易举地让大家都知道了她的来头。自成名以来，除非是在演艺圈子里，她还从没见过如此高明的做法。

他的妻子尼科尔·戴弗正在翻阅一本制作马里兰鸡的食谱，晒黑的脖子上挂着珍珠项链。据罗斯玛丽估计，她约莫有二十四岁，一张脸可以用“美丽”这样常见的词来形容。不过，她的美是上天按照英雄的模式打造的，脸庞和眉眼无不如此，就好像她的五官和表情的变化以及与气质和性格有关的所有部位都是根据罗丹[16]的意图塑造成的，随后再雕琢出“美丽”来，而且恰到好处，稍有闪失就会无可弥补地损伤它的魅力和本质。若论她的嘴，上天雕琢时可谓独具匠心——那张嘴简直就像杂志封面上的丘比特[17]之弓，当然它与脸的其他部位同样美丽。

“你要在这儿待很久吗？”尼科尔问。她声音低缓，有点沙哑。

罗斯玛丽脑海中突然闪出一个念头，觉得自己和母亲再多住一个星期也无妨。

于是她便模棱两可地回答道：“时间不会十分长的。我们出国已有一段时间了，三月里在西西里上的岸，然后就慢慢地朝北走。去年一月，我拍电影时得了肺炎，正在逐渐康复。”

“天呀！是怎么得的？”

“哦，是因为下水游泳造成的。”罗斯玛丽不太愿意披露她个人的私事，于是勉强地说，“一天我不巧感冒了，但没有注意到。当时正好要拍一个镜头，要我跳入威尼斯的一条运河。那个摄影场地非常昂贵，所以我得反复跳水，跳了一个上午。我母亲找了个医生到场，但无济于事，我还是得了肺炎。”她还没等他们开口就断然改变了话题，问道：“你们喜欢这个地方吗？”

“他们哪能不喜欢！”阿贝·诺思慢吞吞地说，“这个地方还是他们开发出来的呢。”他慢慢地转过高贵的头，双眼温柔而深情地望着戴弗夫妇。

“哦，是吗？”

“这家旅馆去年夏天营业，这才是第二个年头，”尼科尔解释道，“我们劝说高斯留一个厨师、一个侍者和一个杂工，开始只是保本，今年收益就好多了。”

“你们怎么不住在旅馆里？”

“我们建了一座房子，就在塔姆斯。”

“事情是这样的，”迪克一边说，一边调整了一下遮阳伞，遮住了落在罗斯玛丽肩膀上的一片阳光，“北边所有的旅游胜地，如多维尔[18]，都被俄国人和英国人占了，他们不怕冷，而我们美国人有一半来自热带，这就是为什么我们开始到这儿来的缘故。”

那个拉丁裔的年轻人在翻看《纽约先驱报》，这时他冷不丁说道：“你们看这些人都是哪个国家的？”接着，他就略带法语音调念起了报：“‘在沃韦[19]的皇宫旅馆下榻的有潘德莱·弗拉斯科先生、博尼塞夫人’，我可没有夸大其词，‘有科琳娜·梅多卡夫人、帕舍夫人、泽拉菲姆·图利奥、玛丽亚·阿玛丽亚·罗托·梅斯、莫伊塞斯·托伊贝尔、帕拉戈勒斯夫人、阿波斯托尔·亚历山大、约朗德·优素福戈罗，以及热纳维瓦·德·莫穆斯！’最吸引我的是热纳维瓦·德·莫穆斯。远隔万水千山跑到沃韦去，看上她一眼也是值得的。”

说到这里，他突然有点坐不住了，于是站起身用力地伸展了一下躯体。他比戴弗和诺思小几岁，高高的个子，身体结实而瘦削，肩膀和上臂肌肉隆起，显得很有力量。初看，他似乎也是人们常说的那种英俊男子，但是他脸上总有一种淡淡的愤世嫉俗的神情，这就叫他那双炯炯有神的棕色眼睛所散发出的魅力打了折扣。不过，见过他的人，即便会忘掉他的那张遇到无聊的事情就打哈欠的嘴巴，以及因烦躁和无谓的痛苦而皱起的年轻的额头，也不会忘掉他的眼睛。

“上星期的美国新闻人物中，有几个的确是佼佼者。”尼科尔说，“伊芙琳·奥斯特夫人就是人中翘楚……还有谁呢？”

“还有S.弗莱希先生。”戴弗边说边站了起来，把耙子拿过来，开始细心地耙掉沙子里的小石子。

“哦，是吗？你不觉得S.弗莱希这个人很讨厌吗？”

罗斯玛丽觉得跟母亲的共同语言不多，同尼科尔在一起就更没有太多的话可说了。阿贝·诺思和那个叫巴尔班的法国人谈起了摩洛哥，尼科尔抄完食谱又做起针线活儿来。罗斯玛丽细看了一下他们所带的物品——四把大遮阳伞（合在一起就是一个遮阳篷）、一个便携式冲凉更衣室和一只充气的橡皮马。这些都是时髦玩意儿，她见都没见过，是战后问世的第一批奢侈品（说不定他们还是第一批奢侈品顾客呢）。她由此判断他们是些时尚人物。尽管母亲自小就教导她要远离好逸恶劳的膏粱子弟，但她并不觉得这些人有那么可怕。甚至在如此悠闲的上午，大家都无事可做，她也觉得这些人心怀壮志，并非碌碌无为，有一定的人生目标，而且在努力实现自己的目标，与她以前认识的人迥然不同。她毕竟涉世不深，关心的只是他们对她的态度，对于他们彼此之间微妙的关系却难以辨清。不过，她观察到他们彼此和谐、亲密，于是便觉得他们日子过得很快乐。

她一时竟将那三个男子视为自己的所有物，把他们挨个儿细细打量。他们三个都是翩翩君子，并且各具特色——温文尔雅是他们天生的本质，过去如此，现在如此，将来也会如此，不会受到周围环境的影响，不会像电影演员那样逢场作戏。她还在这些人身上发现了根深蒂固的儒雅，有别于导演们粗俗的言语和随便的行为，她以前总觉得导演们风雅，是知识的化身呢。此前，她认识的男人都是些演员和导演，还有看上去形形色色而实际千篇一律的大学生群体，他们只对一见钟情感兴趣，去年秋天在耶鲁大学的舞会上她就见识过这样的大学生。

这三个男子各有千秋。巴尔班稍欠风雅，多了几分怀疑和嘲讽的味道。他为人拘谨，甚至有点过于拘泥于形式。阿贝·诺思腼腆害羞，然而诙谐幽默，出语便叫她感兴趣，又令她疑惑。她自己不苟言笑，严肃有余，生怕这一点会给对方留下不是特别好的印象。

至于迪克·戴弗，他可是完美无瑕的，令她默默地欣赏不已。他的皮肤红红的，被太阳晒得微黑，短短的汗毛也略显红色——茸茸的、稀疏的汗毛从胳膊延伸到手背。他眼睛明亮，湛蓝湛蓝的，鹰钩鼻，目光坦诚，跟人交谈时总是注视着对方，令对方感到心情愉悦。有坦诚的目光注视自己，谁都会感到高兴的。如今还会有谁看着我们说话？——注视我们的大多是好奇的目光，要不就是麻木的目光，根本谈不上坦诚！他的嗓音带着一丝淡淡的爱尔兰口音，听上去有点缠绵，像是要取悦整个世界，然而这却让她觉得他身上有一股硬气，一种自我克制和自我约束的气质，这也是她自己具备的美德。啊，这就是她心目中的白马王子，然而却已经被别人捷足先登！想到这里，她不由发出了一声轻轻的叹息。尼科尔抬起头，看穿了她的心思，也听见了她的叹息。

时近中午，米基思科夫妇、艾布拉姆斯夫人、邓弗里先生和坎皮恩先生也来到了沙滩上。他们带来一把新的遮阳伞，撑好伞后朝戴弗夫妇这边瞥了一眼，随即带着满足的神情钻到了伞下。只有米基思科先生除外，他仍站在外边，不愿到伞下去。迪克耙地时曾从这几个人附近走过，此时回到了他们自己的遮阳伞跟前。

“那两个年轻人在一块儿读《礼仪手册》呢。”他低声说。

“那是准备跟高雅人士打交道哟。”阿贝打趣道。

玛丽·诺思——罗斯玛丽第一天在救生筏上看见过的那个皮肤晒成了古铜色的少妇，她游完泳回来，笑嘻嘻地说：“‘从不颤抖’先生和夫人也大驾光临，跑到这里来了。”

“他们可是这位先生的朋友哩，”尼科尔指指阿贝说道，“为什么不过去和他们说句话呢？难道你不觉得他们很有吸引力吗？”

“他们的确很有吸引力，”阿贝说，“只是我对他们没有感觉罢了。归根结底就是这么回事。”

“哈，我觉得这沙滩上今年夏天的人有点太多了。”尼科尔说，“这可是我们的沙滩，是迪克从乱石滩里耙出来的。”她思忖了一下，为了不让坐在另一把遮阳伞下的三个保姆听到，压低声音说道：“不过，这些人总比去年夏天来的那些英国人强——那些英国人老是大喊大叫什么‘大海多么蓝啊！天空多么白啊！小内莉的鼻头多么红啊！’”

罗斯玛丽听了，暗暗觉得以后可千万不要跟尼科尔这样的人作对。

“你是没见他们打架的场面。”尼科尔接着说道，“你来的前一天，那个已婚男子，就是那个姓名听起来像汽油或黄油代用品的人……”

“米基思科？”

“是的……他们两口子吵架，女的抓一把沙子扔在他脸上，而他骑在他老婆的身上，把她的脸往沙窝里按。我们吓坏了。我赶忙叫迪克去劝架。”

“我觉得，”迪克·戴弗心不在焉地低头看着草席说，“我应该到他们那儿去，邀请他们共进午餐。”

“不，你别去。”尼科尔马上阻止道。

“我觉得这是件大好事。他们来了就是客，咱们不妨把姿态放低一点。”

“咱们的姿态已经够低了。”尼科尔哈哈一笑，寸步不让地说，“我可不愿叫人把我的鼻子按在沙窝里。我这人很厉害，可不是好惹的。”她对罗斯玛丽撂了这么一句，然后提高嗓门喊道：“孩子们，穿上你们的泳衣！”

罗斯玛丽觉得这次游泳将会成为她一生中印象最深的一次，日后每当说到游泳，这次的经历就会突然出现在她的脑海里。这群人同时结伴去了水边，由于长时间窝在一个地方不动，这时迫不及待地带着一身暑气跳进了清凉的海水中，就像有美味咖喱饭和冰镇白葡萄酒等着他们一样。戴弗夫妇的一天就像古老文明家庭里的一天一样不紧不慢，夫妻俩把一切都安排停当、有条不紊，这一项活动与另一项活动之间的衔接十分紧凑。罗斯玛丽完全沉浸在眼前游泳的喜悦中，想不到马上会有一场喋喋不休的普罗旺斯式午宴在等着她。不过，她又一次产生了这样的感觉：迪克在关心她、照顾她。于是，她欣然接受了赴宴的邀请，就像那是一个命令。

尼科尔递给她丈夫一件她刚缝制好的怪模怪样的衣服。后者走进更衣用的帐篷，不一会儿就穿着内裤走了出来。那是一条透明、镶黑边的内裤，立刻引起了一阵骚动。细看才知道那条内裤实际上是用肉色的布作了内衬。

“哟嘿，这又在玩什么鬼把戏了！”米基思科先生轻蔑地嚷嚷了一声。随后他马上回过头对邓弗里先生和坎皮恩先生说道：“哦，请原谅。”

罗斯玛丽见了这条短裤，心里暗暗称道。她天真稚嫩，只知道欣赏戴弗夫妇讲求奢华单纯的作风，却不知道其中的复杂性和深意，不知道他们的这种生活方式其实是更注重质量，而不是拥有一大堆从世界各地淘来的廉价品。她也不知道他们之所以举止朴素大方、心态平静、待人和善、注重单纯的人性，是经过与神明激烈的讨价还价的，是经过了一番惨烈的心灵搏斗的，这些情况是她想都想不到的。此时，戴弗夫妇在服饰上标新立异代表着一个阶层最大程度的进化，这使得大多数人都相形见绌——事实上，一种质的变化已经开始，只是罗斯玛丽意识不到罢了。

她和他们在一起，陪他们喝雪利酒、吃饼干。迪克·戴弗用他那双沉静的蓝眼睛望着她，他的嘴巴可亲而又坚毅，接着他体贴、从容地说道：“好长时间我都没见过你这样焕发出勃勃青春魅力的女孩了。”

回到客房后，罗斯玛丽伏在母亲的腿上哭了一次又一次。

“我爱他，母亲。我爱他爱得要命。想不到我会对一个人产生如此强烈的感情。他是有妇之夫，我喜欢他，也喜欢他的妻子……这是没有希望的爱，但我太爱他了！”

“我倒很想见见他。”

“戴弗夫人邀请咱们星期五去赴宴。”

“要是你在恋爱，你就应该觉得快乐。你应该笑才对。”

罗斯玛丽仰起头来，美丽的脸庞颤动了一下，绽放出了一个微笑——母亲历来对她都具有强大的影响力。





第五章


罗斯玛丽闷闷不乐地到蒙特卡洛去，心里别提有多么不高兴。她乘车沿着通往拉蒂尔比耶[20]的崎岖的山路来到了高蒙电影公司[21]——这家公司历史悠久，如今正在重建。她站在装有栅栏的入口处递上名片，等候答复。这时她朝里面望了望，觉得自己仿佛到了好莱坞一样。里面有最近某部影片里出现过的古里古怪的废墟，有一条破破烂烂的印度街道，一条庞大的纸板做的鲸鱼，一棵参天大树，上面结的樱桃跟篮球一样大。这些带有异域风情的景致大放光彩，跟土生土长的灰白色苋属植物、含羞草、栓皮栎及矮松一样，和周围的环境融为一体。那里还有一座快餐棚、两个谷仓模样的戏台。电影公司附近，随处可见满怀期待和憧憬、涂脂抹粉的面孔。

过了十分钟，一个有着如金丝雀羽毛那样的金黄色头发的小伙子急匆匆来到了门口。

“请进，霍伊特小姐。布雷迪先生正在拍摄现场，不过他急着要见你。很抱歉让你久等了，但你知道，这儿有些法国女士非要硬闯进来……”

制片厂经理打开摄影棚的一扇小门迎接她（那小门镶嵌在没有窗户的墙上）。她跟着经理走进半明半暗的摄影棚，一种熟悉的感觉涌上心头，使她的心情由阴转晴。暗淡的光线下，到处都有人影晃动——一张张死灰色的脸转向她，犹如炼狱的幽灵在注视一个从眼前经过的大活人。耳边传来人们的窃窃私语以及小风琴那悠扬的声音，显然，那琴声来自远处。绕过用布景搭成的拐角，他们来到一座灯光刺眼的舞台跟前。舞台上有一个法国男演员穿着一件衬衫（衬衫的胸口、领子和袖口都是亮粉色），正和一个美国女演员拍戏。他们面对面站着，纹丝不动，目不转睛地望着对方，好像以这种姿态已经站了几个小时了。又过了一阵，场景仍没有变化，他们仍一动不动。一排灯关闭了，发出嘶嘶的声音，接着又打开了。音锤击打出悲怆的音调，声音似乎在请求向远方某处扩散开去。一张青灰色的脸从戏台上炫目的灯光中露出来，冲着黑乎乎的上方喊了几句难以听清的话。这时，罗斯玛丽面前有人开了腔，打破了沉寂：“宝贝，你就别脱袜子了，再有十双也会叫你糟蹋掉的。当心衣服，那件衣服是十五英镑买来的！”

说话的人后退时撞上了罗斯玛丽。这时，只听制片厂经理介绍道：“喂，厄尔，这位是霍伊特小姐。”

他们这是第一次见面。布雷迪热情奔放，是个雷厉风行的人。跟他握手时，罗斯玛丽看见他在上下打量自己——她熟悉那样的目光，心里很放松，而且隐约有一种优越感，觉得自己占据着上风。要是把自己的身体作为本钱的话，她完全可以充分发挥她潜在的长处。

“我早就想着你哪一天会大驾光临呢。”布雷迪说道，对于私人交谈这话就显得拿腔拿调了，而且还拖着一种有点挑衅的伦敦土腔，“旅途愉快吗？”

“愉快倒是愉快，但我们思家心切。”

“哪里的话！”布雷迪说道，“在这里住一阵再说……我有话要对你说呢。恕我冒昧，我想谈谈你的那部电影，就是《父女情深》。我在巴黎看了，当即给大洋彼岸拍了电报，想弄清楚你是否已经签约。”

“我刚刚签过……很遗憾。”

“哇，那可真是一部好片子！”

对于这样的评价，罗斯玛丽没有回以傻笑表示赞许，而是微微皱了皱眉头。

“只是一部片子而已，谁也别指望因此而留名青史。”她说道。

“不错，的确如此。你有什么计划吗？”

“母亲认为我需要休息。回国后，我们也许会同国家第一制片厂签约，或者跟名艺公司续约。”

“谁是我们？”

“就是我和我母亲。事业上的事她做主。没有她我寸步难行。”

他又把她细细地打量了一番。这时，罗斯玛丽对他产生了一种感情——这种情愫并非喜爱，也完全不是今天上午在海滩上她对那个男子怀有的情不自禁的爱慕，而是一见如故。他想要得到她，而她情窦初开，心里在考虑着是不是顺从他。不过，她知道只要离开他，用不了半个小时就会把他忘掉，就像忘掉在电影里跟她接吻的男演员一样。

“你们住在哪儿？”布雷迪问道，“哦，对啦，是住在高斯旅馆。顺便提一句，今年我也订了计划。不过，上次给你写的那封信仍然有效。康妮·塔尔梅奇太嫩，我还是想请你出演。别的人我是不想请的。”

“我也很愿意加盟。你为什么不回好莱坞呢？”

“我受不了那个鬼地方。我在这儿挺好。等着，我把这个镜头拍完就带你四处转转。”

说完，他便回到拍摄现场，向那位法国男演员交代着什么，声音低缓、柔和。

五分钟过去了，布雷迪还在滔滔不绝地说着，而那位法国男演员不时地倒换双脚和点头。突然，布雷迪中断了话头，冲着旁边的灯光喊了句什么，因为那地方射来一束强光，吓了他们一跳。此时，罗斯玛丽仿佛听见洛杉矶在召唤她，于是便产生了返回好莱坞，再次勇敢地回到那座分割成一小块一小块的影城里打拼的愿望。她能感觉到布雷迪拍完这个镜头后会对她有什么样的欲望，而她已没有了见布雷迪的情绪，于是她像被施了咒一般离开了拍摄现场。地中海世界不再那么寂静无声，因为她知道这儿有一家电影制片厂正在拍片子。看见大街上的行人，她也感到满心喜欢，还在去车站的路上给自己买了一双帆布便鞋。

母亲见女儿不折不扣地完成了她的嘱托，觉得很高兴。不过，她心里还是想叫女儿扩大社交圈子，发展演艺事业。这位斯皮尔斯夫人从外表看气色还好，但实际已深感疲惫——照料垂死的病人毕竟令人心力交瘁，而她已经有了两次这样的经历，为两个丈夫送了终。





第六章


午餐时喝了玫瑰葡萄酒，尼科尔·戴弗感到心情舒畅，高高地抱着双臂，肩膀上的假山茶花几乎能碰上她的面颊。她走出房间来到美丽的花园里，这儿看不到一根杂草。花园的一面挨着住房（一条小径通向庭院），两侧是古老的村落，最后的一面是悬崖，而悬崖的岩脊向茫茫的大海延伸。

花园靠着村落的那两侧，围墙根所有的一切都落满了灰尘——那儿有盘根错节的葡萄藤、柠檬树和桉树，还有一辆被人随意丢弃的手推车，虽丢弃不久，却已经深陷泥土中，和小径连为一体，都有些风化和朽烂了。尼科尔换了一个方向，经过芍药苗圃，走进一个绿枝掩映下的阴凉之地，这儿的树叶和花瓣都打着卷儿，上面萦绕着一片轻柔的水汽——每次来这儿，她都会有耳目一新的感觉。

她戴着一块淡紫色头巾，在颈前系了个结。在白花花的阳光下，头巾将一团淡紫色罩在了她的脸上，也给她那移动的脚旁投下了淡紫色的影子。她神情凝重，几乎有点冷峻，只是她那双绿眼睛闪动的却是迷离的光芒，惹人爱怜。她的一头金发已失去了光泽。不过，她现在虽然二十四岁了，看上去却比十八岁时更加妩媚，尽管那时她的头发比现在亮丽。

白色界石后面如烟似雾般的花丛中有一条小径，她顺着小径来到一处能够眺望大海的地方。这儿有几只灯笼静静地挂在无花果树枝上。一张大桌子、几把柳条椅和一把锡耶纳[22]出产的大型遮阳伞摆放在一棵高大的松树下面（这是花园中最大的一棵树）。她在这儿停留了一会儿，漫不经心地望着一丛旱金莲和缠结在它根部的鸢尾。这些花仿佛是谁随手撒下一把种子，然后就从土里长出来的。她一边看，一边听着房子里传来的孩子们的争吵声，有埋怨，也有指责。随着一阵夏天的微风吹来，那声音消失了。她又继续往前走，欣赏着路两旁盛开着的粉红色云团般的千姿百态的芍药花，黑色和棕色的郁金香，以及娇嫩的紫茎玫瑰花——这些花就像糖果店橱窗里的糖制花朵一样晶莹剔透。最后，她来到了一段潮湿的台阶前，台阶通向五英尺以下的低处。至此，那似乎由五彩斑斓的鲜花演奏的乐曲戛然而止，消逝于半空中。

那低处有一口水井，周围铺有木板，即使在最晴朗的日子里，井边上也是湿漉漉、滑溜溜的。她从另一头登上台阶，走进菜园，步子迈得非常快。尽管她有时给人的印象是懒洋洋的，喜静不喜动的，其实她活泼好动。她不善言谈，也不相信语言的力量，因而在世人面前少言寡语，而一旦开口，她吐出的话语文雅、幽默，精练到了极点。不过，她精练的语言有时会叫陌生人感到不自在，这时她就会变得口若悬河，就连她自己也会为她的健谈感到意外。大谈特谈一通之后，她又会来个急刹车，突然恢复原样，神情有点腼腆，就像一只追逐猎物时非常凶猛，现在则十分乖顺的猎犬。

她站在绿意盎然的菜园里，看见迪克横穿前方的小径到他的工作间去。她没吱声，目送他走远，然后继续朝前走，从一行行的蔬菜旁走过（这些蔬菜将会被做成沙拉），来到了一个小动物园——这儿有鸽子、兔子，还有一只鹦鹉，见了她便乱叫，一点礼貌也没有。她走下台阶，来到一块岩礁上。这儿有一堵低矮、弯曲的墙，从此处可以俯视七百英尺下的地中海。

她所在的位置是古老的山村——塔姆斯。她家的别墅及庭院是由紧靠悬崖边的一排农舍改建成的——五间小屋子打通做了住房，另四间屋子拆掉建成了园子。外面的围墙没有动，所以从下面的公路远看是看不见这座别墅的——它隐没在了一片灰紫色的山村中。

她虽然有一双不知疲倦的手，但此时无所事事，只顾观看脚下的地中海。过了一会儿，迪克拿着一架望远镜走出他那单间的工作间，向东眺望戛纳，很快就看到了她，于是返回去取来了一个喇叭筒（他有许多这样的机械小玩意儿），冲她喊道：“尼科尔，我忘了告诉你，出于使徒的礼貌我最后还是邀请了艾布拉姆斯夫人，就是那个一头白发的女人。”

“我真怀疑这值得不值得。反正不是件好事。”

她觉得自己这么小的声音说话对方也能听见，似乎贬低了他喇叭筒的价值，于是便提高嗓门喊道：“你能听见我说话吗？”

“能听见。”他说完放下了喇叭筒，但随后又倔强地举了起来，“我还想再请几个人。把那两个年轻人也请上，怎么样？”

“好呀。”她平静地表示同意。

“我意在举办一个乱成一锅粥的聚会，让来的人争风吃醋、相互攻击，要人们回家时心灵破碎，女的在盥洗室昏倒在地。你等着看好戏吧！”

说完，他回自己的工作间了。尼科尔看得出他非常亢奋（这是他的一种极为典型的心态），巴不得让所有的人都跟他一样癫狂。亢奋之后，随之而至的是忧郁——虽然他从不把忧郁表现在脸上，但尼科尔猜得到他一定会有这种情绪。对某种事物的兴致一旦达到异常强烈的程度，就会使事物本身的价值不成比例，会对周围的人产生非同寻常的影响力。除了少数几个心硬如铁、遇事疑神疑鬼的人之外，其他人无不受到他的影响，会想也不想、昏头昏脑地喜欢上他。当他意识到众人喜欢他简直就是浪费感情时，不由得会反思再三。有时回头看，看到他引发的狂热所造成的后果，他不禁感到后怕，就好像一位将军为满足自己的嗜血欲望而下令进行大屠杀之后，看见那血淋淋的场面时感到恐慌一样。

不过，短暂地进入迪克·戴弗的小圈子倒是挺不错的体验。人们会认为他的心里有他们的位置，觉得他独具慧眼，看得到他们虽然随波逐流多年，他们的命运却仍具有独特之处。他对人体贴入微、彬彬有礼，很快就能赢得人们的好感。他所表现出来的这种关怀和风度没有丝毫的犹豫和做作，直到最后才会知道将产生什么样的结果。为避免首次盛开的友谊之花凋落，他会毫不顾忌地打开一扇门，把人们迎入一个诙谐幽默的世界。只要人们沉迷于这个世界，他就会想方设法叫他们感到快乐。可是，要是有人对这个色彩斑斓的世界产生怀疑，哪怕是一丁点的怀疑，他也会突然从他们眼前消失，而他的言行不会给人们留下什么值得咀嚼的回忆。

那天晚上八点半，他出门迎候他的第一批客人，将外套拿在手里，犹如斗牛士拎着他的披风，显得风度翩翩、彬彬有礼。向罗斯玛丽及其母亲致以敬意之后，他便耐心地等待她们母女先说话，仿佛是想让她们在新环境里产生自信——这是他独特的待人接物的方式。

还是谈一谈罗斯玛丽的感受吧。她和母亲沿着山路来到塔姆斯，一路呼吸清新的空气，高兴地欣赏着周围的一景一物。正如出类拔萃的精英由于举止不当，其个人品质就会显得平庸一样，黛安娜别墅苦心经营出来的完美形象因为一些小小的失误而立刻变了样（如女仆不合时宜地出现在后面，酒瓶的软木塞死活拔不出来）。随着第一批客人的光临，夜晚的气氛热闹了起来，白日宁静家庭生活的气氛悄然引退，而戴弗家的孩子和他们的家庭教师仍在露台用餐就是一个标志。

“好漂亮的花园呀！”斯皮尔斯夫人赞叹道。

“这是尼科尔的心肝宝贝，”迪克说，“她无时无刻不在操心它，老是担心那些花会染上什么病症。我倒时时担心她自己会染上白粉病、果斑病或晚疫病什么的而病倒呢。”随后，他用食指朝罗斯玛丽指了指，话锋一转，用一种似乎是想掩盖父辈关怀的语气说：“不许推辞，我一定要送给你一顶沙滩上戴的帽子！”

他带着客人从花园里来到露台上，斟了杯鸡尾酒。这时，厄尔·布雷迪来了，见罗斯玛丽也在这儿，颇感意外。他的举止要比他在电影厂的时候礼貌一些，像是来到大门口才换上的一种表情。罗斯玛丽当即将他同迪克·戴弗做了比较，心里的天平强烈地偏向后者。相形之下，她觉得厄尔·布雷迪有些粗俗，有些缺乏教养，然而却对他的身体产生了一种触电般的感觉。

在户外吃饭的孩子们见到厄尔·布雷迪，站起了身，而他用老熟人的语气对孩子们说：“嗨，拉尼尔，唱支歌怎么样？你愿意和托普西为我唱支歌吗？”

“唱什么歌呢？”小男孩答应了，说话有点南腔北调，一听就知道是在法国长大的美国孩子。

“唱《我的朋友皮埃罗》。”

兄妹俩落落大方地并肩站着唱了起来，歌声甜美而尖锐，飞扬在傍晚的空气中。

皎洁的月光下，

我的朋友皮埃罗呀，

把你的笔借给我用一下，

借你的笔写写字嘛，

我的蜡烛熄灭啦，

再没有亮光啦，

看在上帝的分上，

快开门呀！[23]

歌声停了，孩子们的脸被夕阳映得红彤彤的，笑吟吟地站在那儿，为他们的成功感到高兴。此时此刻，罗斯玛丽觉得黛安娜别墅简直就是世界的中心，在这样的一个大舞台上一定会发生令人难忘的事情。大门在丁零零的门铃声中打开了，其余的客人也到了，这叫她的兴致更高了。

可是看见米基思科夫妇、艾布拉姆斯夫人、邓弗里先生和坎皮恩先生来到了露台上，她顿时扫了兴头，不由飞快瞥了一眼迪克，似乎在询问为什么要请这么多三教九流的客人。迪克神情依旧，看不出任何变化。他神采飞扬地接待客人，态度彬彬有礼，对他的具有无限未知可能性的新客人怀有一种尊重。她对迪克的眼光坚信不疑，当下就觉得邀请米基思科夫妇来是应该的，仿佛她一直在期待着同他们相聚于此似的。

这几个人刚来，阿贝·诺思和妻子紧接着也来了。只听米基思科对阿贝·诺思说：“我在巴黎见过你，实际上见过你两次呢。”

“不错，我记得。”阿贝说。

“那是在什么地方呢？”米基思科不愿听他打哈哈，便追问了一句。

“哦，大概是……”阿贝不想再敷衍下去，干脆地说，“一时想不起来了。”

二人的谈话戛然而止。罗斯玛丽觉得应该有人出来说几句圆场的话。可是迪克不愿拆散刚到的客人三三两两组成的谈话圈子，甚至不愿打消米基思科夫人那种扬扬自得的气焰。他没有解决这个社交问题，因为他知道这个问题当前无关紧要，反正最终也会自动解决的。他正在养精蓄锐，等待一个具有非常意义的时刻到来，那时候客人们就会意识到什么叫欢乐了。

这时，罗斯玛丽站在汤米·巴尔班的身旁。后者心中郁结着强烈的愤世嫉俗的情绪，好像心里受到了刺激一样。罗斯玛丽听说他次日上午要离开此处，便问道：“是要回家去吗？”

“回家？我没有家。我要去打仗。”

“打什么仗？”

“打什么仗？随便什么仗都可以。近来没看过报，但我觉得一定会爆发战争，总是有仗可打的。”

“对于参战的目的难道你不在乎吗？”

“根本不在乎，只要待遇好就行。感到无聊的时候，我就来戴弗他们家，因为一到这里，过不了几个星期我就想去参战。”

罗斯玛丽感到愕然，试探性地问：“你喜欢他们吧？”

“当然喜欢……尤其是她……可是见了他们，我就想去打仗。”

罗斯玛丽想了想，仍一头雾水。戴弗夫妇让她想永远待在他们身旁。

“你是半个美国人嘛。”她说道，似乎这句话就足以解决问题了。

“我也是半个法国人，还在英国上过学，十八岁参军，穿过八个国家的军服。但愿不要给你留下一种印象，觉得这么一来我就不喜欢戴弗夫妇了。我照样喜欢他们，尤其喜欢尼科尔。”

“又有谁不喜欢他们呢？”她淡淡地说。

她觉得自己同他是两股道上跑的车。他话中有话，听上去叫她反感。由于他话语苦涩，含有亵渎的意味，竟使得她对戴弗夫妇的崇拜也大为减弱。她很高兴吃饭时他的座位没有和她挨着。大家一起向花园里的餐桌走去时，她仍然在琢磨他所说的“尤其是尼科尔”这句话。

在小径上，有一刻她走在迪克·戴弗的身边，觉得他沉着、机智，显得坚定自信、无所不知，让周围所有的人都黯然失色。回想起来，在这一年当中（多么漫长的一年啊），她钱囊充盈，有一定的名气，同社会名流你来我往（这些名流其实只不过是些喜欢摆谱的人，交际圈子里都是蜗居在巴黎膳宿公寓的医生的遗孀及其女儿之类的人）。她具有浪漫情怀，可是她的职业生涯却没有提供许多令人满意的机会使她的这种情怀得以释放。母亲对她的事业寄予厚望，绝不会允许她感情用事，受虚假爱情的欺骗，这有损于她的事业。其实，罗斯玛丽是个超脱的人，虽在电影界崭露头角，却不沉迷其中，此时看见母亲脸上出现了对迪克·戴弗感到满意的神色，便认定迪克·戴弗是她的“真命天子”。这就是说，母亲同意她向纵深处发展了。

“我一直在观察你呢。”这时只听迪克·戴弗说道。罗斯玛丽明白他的意思，“我们越来越喜欢你了。”

“我第一次见到你的时候就爱上你了。”她静静地说。

他装作没有听见，只当是一句纯粹场面上的恭维话。

“有时跟新朋友在一起，”他斟词酌句地说，仿佛这一点很重要似的，“比跟老朋友在一起更叫人感到心情舒畅。”

罗斯玛丽丈二和尚摸不着头脑，不知道他葫芦里卖的什么药。这时她发现自己已经走到餐桌跟前，茫茫暮色里亮起灯光，将餐桌照得一片通明。她瞅见迪克右手挽起她母亲的胳膊入座，心头不由涌起一阵喜悦，而她本人则坐在了路易斯·坎皮恩和布雷迪之间。

她激情澎湃地转向布雷迪，想要对他说说心里话，可是她一提起迪克来，对方的双眼就射出冰冷冷的光，这使她明白他拒绝扮演父亲般的角色。反过来，当他试图独占她的感情时，她的拒绝也同样坚决。因而他们只是说些本行业的话，或者是对方讲，她只是听。出于礼貌，她一直盯着布雷迪的脸，而一颗心却飞往了别处——她觉得对方也能感受到这一点。布雷迪的话她听了个大意，其余的意思则是靠猜度，这就像一个人听敲钟，是钟声响了一半才听的，至于前边究竟敲了几下，只有靠回荡在脑海里的钟声的节奏瞎猜了。





第七章


在说话的间隙，罗斯玛丽看看餐桌的四周，只见尼科尔坐在汤米·巴尔班和阿贝·诺思之间，一头浓密的秀发在烛光下如同涌动的泡沫。尼科尔说话不多，声音圆润、清脆，强烈地吸引着她。

“可怜的人呀，”尼科尔高声说道，“你为什么想把那位侍者锯成两半呢？”

“自然是想看看侍者肚子里装有什么东西呗。难道你就不想知道吗？”

“装的是菜单呗，”尼科尔咯咯一笑说，“还有几块破瓷片、一点儿小费和几截铅笔头。”

“对极了！不过，还得用科学的方法加以证明才行。当然，可以用演奏用的乐锯来证明，同时还能够把乌七八糟的东西全清理掉。”

“你演奏难道打算用那样的乐锯？”汤米问。

“当时还没等我们用，就听见了尖叫声，一时把我们吓了一跳，还以为那家伙把碟子什么的打碎了呢。”

“这一切听起来多么荒唐，”尼科尔说，“一个音乐家竟然要用乐锯锯人……”

他们在餐桌旁坐了半个小时，便出现了一种可以感觉得到的变化——他们一个接一个摒弃了某些东西，或思虑的事，或焦躁，或猜疑之心，全都展现出自己最光彩的一面，一心想成为戴弗家体面的嘉宾。人人都尽力捧场，因为如果表现得不够友好或者无精打采，似乎就会拂逆戴弗夫妇的一片诚意。罗斯玛丽看在眼里，心里对众人产生了好感（但米基思科除外）。米基思科大放厥词，成了这次聚会的异类。他如此作为并非出于恶意，而是刚来时兴致就高，此时只不过是想借着酒劲保持原有的兴致罢了。他仰靠在厄尔·布雷迪和艾布拉姆斯夫人之间的椅子上，对后者不置一词，却冲着前者发表了一通有关电影的尖刻的言论，还盯着坐在斜对面的迪克·戴弗，脸上显出极具嘲讽意味的神情，这种神情每每在试图与迪克说话时才会收敛。

“你是范布伦·登比的朋友，对不对？”他问迪克·戴弗。

“这个人我恐怕不认识。”

“我还以为你俩是朋友呢。”他恼羞成怒地回了一句。

他见有关登比先生的话题无法持续下去，便话锋一转，扯到了一些别的同样不着边际的事情上，而迪克始终都在彬彬有礼地倾听，不置可否，这叫米基思科倍感尴尬。一阵子冷场之后，被他中途打断了的谈话又继续了下去——众人将他抛在一旁，交谈甚欢。他想插话却插不进去，尴尬得就像和一只空手套在握手，对方已把手从手套里悄悄抽了出去。最后，他无可奈何地假装和孩子们说话，其实心灰意冷，只顾喝闷酒了。

罗斯玛丽看看这个，再看看那个，目光不停地观察着餐桌旁的人们，真心希望大家开心快乐，仿佛那些人是她未来要收养的孩子一般。餐桌上有一碗用凯歌香槟[24]烹饪的香石竹，香味扑鼻，折射出一道柔和的光，而那光投射在艾布拉姆斯夫人的脸上，使那张脸显得生动活泼、慈祥宽容，似少女般天真无邪。艾布拉姆斯夫人身边坐着罗亚尔·邓弗里先生，面容清秀似女孩子一般，在这夜晚欢乐的时刻并不过分使人感到吃惊。再过去便是维奥莉特·米基思科了，浑身的美都表现在了脸上，所以也就不再想招摇过市，凸显她那眼看就要冉冉升起的文坛新星之妻的地位了。

随后是迪克——他细心观察着场上的形势，显得从容不迫，完全沉浸在自己的聚会之中。

再下来就是她的母亲了——母亲永远都是那般完美。

再过去则是巴尔班——巴尔班正在跟她母亲交谈，他口齿伶俐、温文尔雅，又一次赢得了罗斯玛丽对他的好感。然后是尼科尔——罗斯玛丽突然对她有了新的认识，觉得她是自己认识的人里面最漂亮的一个。尼科尔美若天仙，面孔似北欧的圣母，在尘埃飞扬的烛光中熠熠闪光，而松树上灯笼投下的深红色光芒给她的脸蒙上了一层红晕。她是那样的文静！

就在这时，阿贝·诺思和罗斯玛丽谈起了他的道德信条，口气坚定地说道：“我当然有自己的道德准则。没有道德准则真不知怎么立足于世！我坚决反对对女巫实施火刑，他们每烧死一个女巫都叫我义愤填膺。”罗斯玛丽听布雷迪说过，他是个音乐家，出道较早，红过一阵，现在已有七年没有作过什么曲子了。

接下来要观察的是坎皮恩——坎皮恩千方百计遮掩住身上的那股明显的女人气，甚至跟旁边的人说话也一脸淡漠，俨然就是一个老妇人。再过去是玛丽·诺思，她喜笑颜开，露出一口白牙，张开的两片芳唇周围形成一个可爱的小圆圈，里面包含着欢乐，让你觉得非得还她一个微笑不可。

最后就剩下布雷迪了——此时的布雷迪已逐渐变得随和了，不再不顾礼貌地反复标榜自己是如何心智健全，不再以别人的弱点来衬托自己的智慧。

罗斯玛丽有一种归家的感觉，就像伯内特夫人[25]的一本缺点很多的书中的那个孩子，离开远方的一个放荡纵欲的邪恶地区，怀揣纯洁的信念，踏上了返回故乡的旅程。但见萤火虫在夜空中飞舞，远处有只狗在悬崖下边突出的礁石上吠叫。餐桌犹如一座活动舞台，朝星空冉冉上升，而坐在餐桌旁的人们有一种身处漆黑一团的宇宙里的感觉，孤零零的，仅靠桌子上的那点食物维持生命，仅靠那点光亮取暖。这时，米基思科夫人哈哈一笑，声音压抑、古怪，让人觉得他们已经脱离了尘世。突然，戴弗夫妇变得热情洋溢、谈笑风生、喜气洋洋的，似乎想弥补在招待方面的不足——其实，他们已经以微妙的方式让客人产生了宾至如归的感觉，以彬彬有礼的态度使客人觉得自己很受尊重，以弥补他们在已被远远抛在脑后的现实世界里未曾得到的东西。有一阵子，他们似乎跟在座的每一个人说话（或单个说，或两口子一块儿说），让大家感受到他们的友谊和深情。这时，一张张脸都朝向他们，就像可怜的孩子们在仰望圣诞树。然而，宴会突然结束了。客人们刚刚从觥筹交错中进入一个比较温馨的感情世界，还没来得及细细品味，甚至还没意识到自己已经步入了这样一个世界，宴会便戛然而止了。

不过，那炎热、散发着芬芳的南方，那柔和的夜晚以及远处地中海隐隐的涛声，产生了一种魔力，令他们陶醉。这魔力融入戴弗夫妇的血液，成为他们身体的一部分。罗斯玛丽看见尼科尔将一只她母亲称赞过的晚间用的黄色提包塞给了她，说道：“我觉得物品应属于喜欢它的人。”说完便把她能找到的所有黄色物品一股脑儿塞进了包里，其中有一支铅笔、一管口红和一本小巧的日记本，“拿着吧，它们是成套的。”

尼科尔说完就离开了。罗斯玛丽注意到迪克转眼也不见了。客人们在花园里随处游逛，有的则向露台慢慢走去。

“你想去洗手间吗？”维奥莉特·米基思科问罗斯玛丽。

罗斯玛丽回答说不想去。

“我想去一趟洗手间。”米基思科夫人说。说完，这个口无遮拦的女人便向房子走去，揣着她的秘密。罗斯玛丽望着她的背影，感到一阵不满。厄尔·布雷迪提议和她一道去海堤上走走，但她想等迪克回来，于是就没有去，而是留下来听米基思科和巴尔班打口水仗。

“你为何老想和苏联人拼个你死我活？”米基思科问，“难道你不觉得苏联是人类历史上最伟大的尝试吗？跟里夫那儿的人[26]作战又为哪般？我觉得，为正义而战才算英雄好汉。”

“你怎么知道哪一方才是正义的？”巴尔班干巴巴地问。

“哼，凡是有脑子的人一般都知道。”

“你是共产主义者吗？”

“我是一个社会主义者，”米基思科说，“我同情苏联。”

“是吗？我是个军人，”巴尔班温和地说道，“我的职业便是杀人。我同里夫那儿的人打仗，因为我是一个欧洲人，而我同苏联人打仗，是因为他们要剥夺我的财产。”

“多么狭隘的见解！”米基思科看看四周，想要找个志同道合者，但没有成功。他不明白巴尔班究竟出了什么毛病，不知该怪对方脑子太简单，还是该怪对方阅历太复杂。米基思科知道什么叫作人生观。随着思想的成熟，面对五花八门的人生观，他学会了甄别和选择。而现在，在他面前的这个“笨蛋”身上看不到有什么人生观，可他自己并没有感到高对方一等。他最后得出结论：巴尔班是旧时代的余孽，这样的人毫无价值可言。他和美国的纨绔子弟打过交道，产生的印象是：这些人反复无常、趋炎附势，明明愚昧无知却沾沾自喜，忸怩作态又蛮横无理，亦步亦趋地学习英国人，却又不考虑英国人为何那般市侩和无礼，只是匆匆忙忙将这样的为人处世方法运用于美国；而在那块国土上，只要稍微有一点知识，略微懂一点礼貌，收益之大则会高于其他国家，登峰造极的表现就是出现在一九○○年左右的所谓的“哈佛态度”。他认为巴尔班就属于这一类人。由于贪杯，他喝晕了头，全然忘记了自己对巴尔班的敬畏，结果不久便尝到了苦头。

罗斯玛丽隐隐为米基思科感到羞愧，在一旁等待着迪克·戴弗回来，脸上十分平静，实际心急火燎。她陪着巴尔班、米基思科和阿贝坐在空了的餐桌旁，抬头望去，目光顺着幽暗的桃金娘和蕨类植物夹道的小径飘向石头露台，在灯火通明的大门前看见了母亲的身影，心里不禁涌起了一股柔情。她正要起身到那里去，只见米基思科夫人急匆匆地从屋里走了过来。

米基思科夫人显得情绪激动，一声不吭地拉过一把椅子坐下，目光呆滞，嘴唇颤抖，看得出有满腹的心事。大家的眼睛都看着她，于是她丈夫就自然地问了一声：“怎么啦，维奥莉特？”

“亲爱的……”她终于出了声，然后又把头转向了罗斯玛丽，“亲爱的……没什么。有件事我实在说不出口。”

“说吧，我们都是你的朋友。”阿贝说。

“哦，我到楼上去，谁知竟看到了那样的情景，亲爱的……”

她神秘地摇摇头，话没说完就把后边的话咽了回去，因为汤米起身用一种礼貌但严厉的语气对她说：“不管那儿发生了什么事情，咱们都不便妄加议论！”





第八章


维奥莉特用力地、大声地吸了口气，脸上换了种表情。

迪克总算来了，他一来就凭着感觉将巴尔班和米基思科两口子分开了，然后就显出一副门外汉的样子，向米基思科请教有关文学的问题，令后者立刻产生了一种优越感，而这正是后者所需要的。另外的几个人则帮忙提着灯往上走（黑暗中走路，有谁不愿意帮忙提灯，既利人又利己？）。罗斯玛丽也提灯在手，一边还要满足罗亚尔·邓弗对好莱坞的好奇心，回答他那没完没了的提问。

罗斯玛丽心中暗想：“等了这么长时间，现在应该有机会跟迪克单独在一起了。我的心思他一定是明白的——他的为人处世和母亲对我的指教是一样的。”

罗斯玛丽猜对了——迪克果然叫上她走了，离开露台上的人群，相伴着出了家门，朝着海堤那儿走。道路崎岖，石阶忽高忽低，有的地方她气喘吁吁地跟着，有的地方她得靠迪克搀扶。

二人一道放眼眺望地中海，但见有一艘游船行驶在远方——那是来自莱兰群岛[27]的最后一班船，正轻盈地驶过海面，犹如七月四日[28]的气球飘在空中，轻轻地划破幽暗的海浪，在黑魆魆的岛屿之间穿行。

“你说过你母亲的教养之方，我心悦诚服。”迪克说道，“我觉得她对你的关怀真是无微不至。像她那样聪慧的母亲在美国极为罕见。”

“我的母亲是完美的。”罗斯玛丽似祷告一般地说。

“我跟她谈起我的一项计划，她说你们母女在法国待多久完全取决于你。”

“应该是取决于你！”罗斯玛丽差点儿叫出声来。

“鉴于这里的社交季节已经结束……”

“这就结束啦？”罗斯玛丽问。

“嗯，是呀，今年夏天的社交季算结束了。尼科尔的姐姐上星期就走了，明天汤米·巴尔班也要走人。阿贝和玛丽·诺思计划下星期一离开。今年夏天也许还可以再玩上几天，但大戏已经谢幕。长痛不如短痛，免得叫人揪心，所以我举办了这场离别晚会。实不相瞒，阿贝·诺思要回美国去，我和尼科尔准备到巴黎为他送行。不知你愿意不愿意和我们一道去？”

“我母亲怎么说？”

“她说这个计划挺好。她自己不想去，是想叫你单独跟我们走。”

“我长大以后还没有回过巴黎呢，”罗斯玛丽说，“我很乐意和你们一起旧地重游。”

“那真是太好了。”迪克说道（罗斯玛丽突然觉得他的语气有点生硬——难道这是错觉吗？），“你一出现在沙滩上，我们就为你感到很兴奋，而且觉得你充满了活力，我们坚信这一定跟你的职业有关系。尼科尔对此更是深信不疑。不管遇到任何人、任何团体，这样的活力永远都不会耗尽。”

她的直觉告诉她，他正慢慢地把话题从她这里向尼科尔转移，她控制住自己，用同样生硬的语气说：

“我也是想跟大家认识一下，尤其想认识你。咱们初次见面时我就爱上了你，这话我曾告诉过你。”

罗斯玛丽这样打开天窗说亮话无可非议。不过，海阔天空的景色已经让迪克的头脑冷静了下来，刚才带她来这里是出于一时的冲动，而现在这种冲动已烟消云散。面对罗斯玛丽露骨的表白，他不知所措，就像是在演出未经排练的戏剧，一时找不到话来说。

现在想让罗斯玛丽随他返回房子那儿，已经不是件容易的事了。他心里并不愿意失去她，于是便用诙谐幽默的语言跟她谈笑起来。而罗斯玛丽只觉得轻风拂面。

“你不知道自己想要的是什么。不妨回去问问你母亲再说。”

罗斯玛丽像被击中了。她用手摸了摸他，觉得他的黑色外套十分光滑，就像牧师做弥撒时穿的十字褡，恨不得跪下来。就是在这种状态下，她脱口说道：“我觉得，除了我母亲，你是我见过的最棒的人了。”

“想不到你还有一双慧眼哟。”

迪克哈哈笑着，把罗斯玛丽带到了露台那儿，然后将她交给了尼科尔……

很快到了分手的时候。戴弗夫妇匆匆跟大家告别。汤米·巴尔班要带着他的行李坐戴弗夫妇的那辆大型伊索塔轿车[29]走（他在旅馆过夜，以便赶次日的早班火车），同车的还有艾布拉姆斯夫人、米基思科夫妇和坎皮恩。厄尔·布雷迪乘自己的车回蒙特卡洛，顺路带上罗斯玛丽和她母亲，罗亚尔·邓弗里也搭他的车走，因为戴弗夫妇的那辆车太挤了。花园里的那几盏灯笼仍挂在那里，灯光照在他们吃饭用过的那张餐桌上；戴弗夫妇肩并肩站在门口送客——尼科尔笑容满面，典雅的风姿令夜色生辉，而迪克则在跟客人们一一惜别。罗斯玛丽觉得大家一哄而散，只剩下了他们冷冷清清待在家中，未免太叫人伤感。这时，她脑海中又出现了那个疑团：米基思科夫人到底在洗手间看到了什么？





第九章


夜晚静悄悄、黑沉沉的，整个天空就像装在一个篮子里，而那篮子挂在一颗孤零零、昏昏暗暗的星星上。空气闷闷的，就连前边汽车的喇叭声也闷声闷气的。布雷迪的司机把车开得很慢，只见另一辆车的尾灯每到转弯的地方就一闪一闪的，最后便彻底看不见了。但过了十分钟，那辆车又出现了——它停在了路边。布雷迪的司机在后面放慢车速，然而那辆车的车轮又立刻开始慢慢滚动起来，于是他一踩油门超了过去。就在超过去的那一瞬间，他们听见那辆静悄悄的汽车里传来了模糊不清的说话声，还看见戴弗家的司机在咧嘴笑。汽车继续行驶，车速很快，海滨大道上一会儿漆黑无比，一会儿又夜色如水。最后，汽车驶入起伏向下的山路，向着壮观的高斯旅馆奔去。

回到旅馆，罗斯玛丽迷迷糊糊睡了三个小时，醒来后躺在床上，在月光下遐思不已。撩人的夜色笼罩着她，使得她心猿意马，联想到了跟意中人接吻，但那吻轻飘飘，跟电影里的吻别无两样。她辗转反侧，有生以来第一次出现了失眠的征兆。她试着按母亲的人生观去思考爱情问题。在这方面，她常常显得少年老成，会将自己不经意听到的话语回忆起来。

罗斯玛丽从小接受的教育就是事业为先。斯皮尔斯夫人的两位亡夫给她留下的钱很少，而她把这些钱全都用在了女儿的教育上。女儿长到十六岁时，出落得像含苞待放的鲜花，一头秀发美得惊人，于是这位母亲便带着她赶到艾克斯莱班[30]，也不通报一声就将她送进了一个正在那儿疗养的美国电影制片人的套房。后来，这位电影制片人去了纽约，母女俩也跟着去了。这样，罗斯玛丽便通过了入门考试。有了接踵而来的成功和相对稳定的前途，斯皮尔斯夫人觉得可以用旁敲侧击的方式，跟女儿开诚布公地谈一谈今晚的事情了，于是便说道：“你长大成人是为了事业，并非特意为了嫁人。现在，你遇到了第一个意中人，而且还是个挺不错的意中人，那你就大胆尝试吧，全把这当作人生体验，不要在乎自己感情是否会受挫抑或是会伤害到他。不管发生什么样的事情都不会毁掉你，因为在经济上你是个顶天立地的男孩，而非小鸟依人的女孩。”

罗斯玛丽向来懒得动脑子，只依赖母亲那永不枯竭的智慧，因而母亲的一席话就像剪断脐带让她脱离母体一样，叫她难以安眠。天快要亮了，一线微光溜进高大的落地长窗，她从床上爬起来，赤裸着双脚走到外面的露台上，觉得脚心暖暖的。空气中回荡着种种声音，也不知都是些什么声音。网球场那边的树上，一只坏脾气的鸟得意扬扬地叫个不停，一声又一声，声音单调。旅馆后边环形车道响起一阵脚步声，声音的主人一会儿走到土路上，一会儿走上石子小径，再登上水泥台阶，然后再沿原路往回走。从黑魆魆的海面望过去，远处朦朦胧胧可以看见一座高山，那儿住着戴弗夫妇。罗斯玛丽对他们顿生思念之情，仿佛听到他们在轻轻地哼唱一支歌，歌声缥缈如烟，似乎是一支从久远的年代和遥远的地方飘来的圣歌。此时，恐怕他们的孩子仍在熟睡，他们家的大门紧紧关闭，仍像在夜里一样。

她回到房间里，穿上轻便的晨袍和便鞋，又来到外面，沿着长长的露台向大门口走去，脚步迈得很快，因为她发现露台旁其他客房里的人仍在梦乡中。她看见有个人坐在正门前宽宽的白色台阶上，不由停住了脚步——她认出那人是路易斯·坎皮恩，正在暗暗啜泣。

路易斯·坎皮恩尽管没有出声，但哭得很伤心，身子微微颤抖，宛若一个悲恸欲绝的女子。这叫她想起了自己去年演过的一幕场景，于是情不自禁地走过去，用手拍了拍坎皮恩的肩膀。对方惊得叫了一声，随后认出了她。

“怎么了？”她的目光平静、友好，而不是那种喜欢刺探别人隐私的睨视，“我能帮你吗？”

“谁都帮不了我，这我很清楚。要怪只能怪我自己。每次都是一样的。”

“怎么回事？能告诉我吗？”

他看着她想了想，然后断然说道：“不行。等你再长大一些，就会明白一旦坠入情网，该会经受怎样的煎熬。简直太痛苦了！最好保持冷淡，别长大，别恋爱！以前我也有过爱情经历，但从没有像这次一样如此痛苦。正当一切进展顺利的时候，不幸就突然发生了。”

在渐渐亮起来的晨光中，他的脸相当难看，令罗斯玛丽突生厌恶。她的表情没有任何变化，脸上的肌肉动也没动，但坎皮恩却敏锐地感觉到了，于是急忙转换了话题，说道：“阿贝·诺思也住在这里。”

“不会吧？他住在戴弗夫妇家里呀！”

“不错，但他现在在此处。你真不知道出什么事了吗？”

这时，二楼一个房间的百叶窗突然打开，一个人用英语吼道（显然是冲着他们来的）：“你们别说了，好不好！”

罗斯玛丽和路易·坎皮恩识趣地走下台阶，来到通向沙滩的那条路，在路边的一条长凳上坐下。

“你真的什么都不知道吗？亲爱的，这事非同小可……”坎皮恩打开了话匣子，索性一吐为快，“事情发生得太突然了，真是罕见！每次见到性格暴烈的人我都躲着走，有时他们会把我打翻在地，在床上要躺好几天。”

他说话时看着她，露出有点得意的眼神。而她如堕五里雾中，不知他在说什么。

“亲爱的，”他把一只手搭在她的大腿上继续说道，同时将身子朝前一靠，仿佛他的手搭在那儿并非要轻薄她——他对自己很有把握，“他们要举行决斗！”

“什么？”

“他们要举行决斗，只是还不知道用什么武器。”

“谁要决斗呀？”

“容我从头细细道来。”他长长叹了口气，然后才讲述了起来，就好像她不该多问，可他又不能不讲，“你坐的是另一辆车，当然不知道。算你走运，而我起码要少活两年。当时，事情发生得太突然了。”

“什么事？”她问。

“我都不知道导火线是什么。最初，是她先开的口……”

“她是谁呀？”

“维奥莉特·米基思科呗。”说到这里，他压低了声音，仿佛有人藏在凳子下面偷听似的，“这里最好不要提戴弗夫妇的名字，因为他威胁说，谁也不准提他们。”

“他是谁呀？”

“汤米·巴尔班呗。以后你可别对人说我跟你提到过戴弗夫妇。我们弄不明白维奥莉特到底要说什么，因为汤米·巴尔班不停地打岔。后来，维奥莉特的丈夫介入，结果就有了这场决斗，亲爱的。决斗定于今天早晨五点钟，也就是一小时后。”他突然想起自己的伤心事，不由发出了一声叹息，“真希望参加决斗的是我。反正我也没什么活头了，还不如死在决斗场上好。”他说不下去了，由于过分悲哀，身子抖得厉害。

楼上的那扇铁质百叶窗再次砰地打开，又是那个人用英语喊道：“好啦，别再说啦！”

这时阿贝·诺思从旅馆里走了出来，一副心烦意乱的样子，一眼瞧见了他们（他们的身后是大海以及已经发白的天空）。他刚要开口，罗斯玛丽摇了摇头让他别说话。三个人又朝前走了走，在路边的另一条凳子上坐了下来。罗斯玛丽看得出阿贝有点紧张。

“你这么早起来干什么？”阿贝问她。

“我刚起床。”她笑了起来，但想起楼上那个抗议的声音，便急忙止住了笑声。

“是让夜莺的歌声吵醒了吧？”阿贝若有所指地说，随后把刚才的话又重复了一遍，“八成是让夜莺的歌声吵醒的。这位缝衣娘[31]把发生的事告诉你了吧？”

坎皮恩正色说道：“我说的都是我亲耳听到的。”

随后他离座而起，转身就走了。阿贝挨着罗斯玛丽坐了下来。

“你为什么对他这么凶？”罗斯玛丽说。

“我凶吗？”阿贝颇为惊讶地说，“他一大早就在这里哭哭啼啼，哪能怪我。”

“哦，也许他有伤心事吧。”

“可能是这样。”

“决斗是怎么回事？谁要决斗？我猜想那辆车里发生了什么怪事。是不是真的？”

“这当然不是好消息，但恐怕的确是真的。”





第十章


阿贝开始用局外人的语气讲述昨晚发生的事情。当时，戴弗家的那辆车在半路停了下来，而这场风波就起于厄尔·布雷迪的车超过去的那一时刻。那时，维奥莉特·米基思科在向艾布拉姆斯夫人透露一个她意外发现的有关戴弗夫妇的秘密，她说她到他们家楼上后，结果看见了一幅情景，让她印象很深。汤米·巴尔班是戴弗家的看门狗，自然就出面干涉了。其实，维奥莉特讲的事情让人既兴奋又后怕。这种感觉是众人都有的。朋友们谁不希望戴弗夫妇能和和睦睦的，戴弗夫妇甚至比他们意识到的还要重要！？当然，这种和睦是有代价的。有时候，他们两口子就像芭蕾舞剧中光彩照人的角色，吸足了人的眼球，谁知背后有多少隐情。幕后的故事最应该了解！不管怎么说吧，迪克把一些男人引荐给自己的妻子尼科尔，而汤米就是当中的一个。米基思科夫人一个劲儿说她要讲出真情时，难怪汤米会出面阻挠。当时只听汤米说道：“米基思科夫人，请不要再议论戴弗夫人了。”

“我又没有跟你说话。”维奥莉特顶了他一句。

“我想最好别再说他们的闲话了。”

“他们就这么神圣吗？”

“别去议论他们。说点别的什么吧。”

阿贝说汤米坐在坎皮恩边上的一个位子上，具体情况还是坎皮恩告诉他的。

“嗬，你管得可真宽。”维奥莉特回敬道。

谁都知道深夜乘车是怎么一种情状——聚会过后大家都是一副懒散的样子，有的窃窃私语，有的对什么都不闻不问，或无聊乏味，或昏昏欲睡。所以，当汽车停下来，巴尔班大声吼叫时，大家吓了一跳，不知出了什么事。只听他吆喝道，声音高得就像在命令骑兵冲锋陷阵：“这儿离旅馆只有一英里远，你们可以走回去。你们是想自己下车，还是想让我把你们拖下车？要不然就闭上你的臭嘴，让你的老婆也闭嘴，米基思科！”

“你是个恶棍。”米基思科说，“你以为你肌肉发达我就怕你？可我不怕！不行咱们就决斗见分晓……”

他漏嘴说出的这句话正中汤米的下怀，因为汤米是个法国人[32]。只见汤米欠过身去，拍了一下他的肩膀，就算把这件事敲定了。随后，司机继续把车往前开。你们的车就是在这个时候超了过去。后来，两个女人又开始叽叽喳喳地说话，一直到旅馆都没有停。

汤米打电话给戛纳的一个朋友，让他做副手。米基思科说他不打算请坎皮恩做他的副手，因为坎皮恩对这种事不会太热心，所以他打电话给阿贝，电话里什么也没说，只是让阿贝马上过来。维奥莉特·米基思科垮了下来，艾布拉姆斯夫人把她带到自己的房间，给她服了安眠药，于是她就安安静静地在床上睡着了。阿贝一到旅馆就设法同汤米交涉，但汤米坚持让米基思科道歉，其他一概免谈。而米基思科像茅坑里的石头一样又臭又硬，死都不肯道歉。

等到阿贝把这件事情的来龙去脉讲完之后，罗斯玛丽若有所思地问道：“戴弗夫妇知道有人在为他们决斗吗？”

“不知道……他们永远也不会知道此事与他们有关联。坎皮恩真可恶，不该跟你说起这事，但他还是讲了……我倒是叮咛过司机，说如果他不严把口风，我就用我的旧乐锯把他锯成两半。决斗是两个人之间的生死之战，容不得别人瞎掺和。汤米需要的是一次公平的决斗！”

“但愿不要让戴弗夫妇知道才好。”罗斯玛丽说。

阿贝瞧了瞧他的手表说：“我要上楼去看一下米基思科。你想一道去吗？他觉得自己缺少朋友，没人关心他……我敢说他一夜没合眼。”

罗斯玛丽想象得出：米基思科一定精神紧张、心情绝望，苦苦挣扎着熬了一夜。她对那个人既同情又厌恶，略微犹豫了一下便同意一起去了，随即便带着清晨的那股活力，脚步轻盈地跟在阿贝身旁上楼去了。

米基思科坐在床上，虽然手里还端着一杯香槟酒，但是靠酒精激发出来的那种斗狠的劲儿已荡然无存了，他看上去虚弱不堪，神情痛苦，脸色苍白。显而易见，他彻夜未眠，一直在写东西和喝酒，此时看见阿贝和罗斯玛丽，便一脸茫然地问道：“到时间了吗？”

“没到，还有半小时。”

桌子上摊满了纸。看得出他花了很大的精力在写一封长信。最后几页纸上的字写得很大，很潦草。这时，借着渐渐暗下来的电灯光线，他在信尾签上自己的名字，把信塞进信封，然后交给阿贝说：“请把这封信转交给我妻子。”

“你最好去用凉水冲一下头。”阿贝建议道。

“你觉得冲过会好一些吗？”米基思科迟疑地问，“其实我并不想让大脑太清醒。”

“唉，你现在的脸色太难看了。”

米基思科只好乖乖地走进浴室冲头去了。在浴室里，他大声说道：“我把事情搅得乱成了一锅粥。真不知道维奥莉特怎样才能顺顺当当回美国去。我没有买任何保险，哪里知道会遇到这种事情。”

“别说丧气的话。一个小时后，你一定能平安回来，照常吃你的早餐！”阿贝说。

“我相信会这样的。”米基思科说着走出了浴室，头发湿漉漉的，然后盯着罗斯玛丽看了看，仿佛这才刚看到她一样，他的眼眶突然变湿了。“我的小说还没有写完呢，叫我感到痛心的就是这个。你不喜欢我，”他冲着罗斯玛丽说道，“这我也没办法，谁叫我是个穷酸文人呢。”他含糊、沮丧地感叹一番，无奈地摇着头。“我栽过很多跟头，犯过许多错误，但再怎么说我也算跻身于名人之列了。”

说到这里，他打住了话头，把已经熄灭的纸烟又吸了几口。

“我倒是喜欢你，只是觉得你不该跟人决斗。”罗斯玛丽说。

“不错，原本揍他一顿出出气就得了，可现在开弓没有回头箭了。都怪我一怒之下做了一件本不该做的事情。我这个人是个火爆脾气……”他用眼睛紧盯住阿贝，仿佛在等着阿贝对此提出质疑。随后苦笑一声，将早已熄灭的烟蒂举到嘴边，呼哧呼哧喘着粗气，“麻烦在于决斗是我提出的……当时维奥莉特要是不再唠叨，我是不会提出决斗的。当然，即使现在也不晚——我可以一走了之，或者置之不理，付之一笑。可是，这样一来，维奥莉特恐怕再也不会敬重我了。”

“会敬重你的，而且会更加敬重你。”罗斯玛丽说。

“不会的，你是不了解维奥莉特。她一旦占了上风，就会骑在你脖子上撒尿。我们结婚十二年了，有过一个女儿，七岁时死了，以后的日子有多么糟糕可想而知。我们两个都有过一些私情，都只不过是逢场作戏罢了，可是我们的感情却疏远了。昨天夜里她还骂我是个胆小鬼呢。”

罗斯玛丽心里为他感到难过，但没有吱声。

“事已至此，咱们还是看看怎样才能把危险程度降到最低吧。”阿贝说着，打开了一只皮箱，“这里面是巴尔班决斗用的手枪，我借来让你熟悉一下。他把这些手枪装在旅行箱里一直随身带着。”他拿出一把老式手枪，掂了掂分量。

罗斯玛丽见了心惊肉跳，不由叫出了声。米基思科焦虑不安地看了看箱子里的枪，问道：“到时候是不是叫我们各站一处，用这种四五口径的手枪对射？”

“这还不清楚。”阿贝冷冷地说，“依我看，用长管手枪瞄得更准。”

“距离是多远？”米基思科问。

“这个我问过。如果是你死我活的决斗，双方的距离是八步远；如果是为了了结小小的恩怨，距离是二十步远；如果仅仅是为了荣誉而战，距离是四十步远。我提出把距离定为四十步，他的副手表示同意。”

“很好。”米基思科说。

“普希金的小说中写过一场精彩的决斗，”阿贝回忆说，“决斗双方都站在悬崖边上，一旦中枪就坠崖而死。”

米基思科觉得那样的决斗离他太遥远，太书卷气。他用凝重的目光望着阿贝问道：“现在做什么？”

“你要不要下水游一会儿泳，振作一下精神？”

“不了，不了，我不会游泳。”他叹了口气。“真不明白这是怎么回事，”他无奈地说，“我简直鬼迷心窍，竟然要去决斗！”

这种事他平生第一遭遇上。实际上，他这种人耽于虚幻世界，一旦遇到铁一般的残酷现实，便惊讶得手忙脚乱。

“咱们该走了。”阿贝见他有点气馁，便催促了一声。

“好吧。”米基思科猛地灌了一口白兰地，把酒瓶揣到口袋里，带着几乎是凶狠的神情问，“要是我万一打死了他，他们会把我投进监狱吗？”

“我会帮你越过边界，到意大利去的。”阿贝说。

米基思科扫了一眼罗斯玛丽，随后带着歉意对阿贝说：“走之前，我还想单独同你谈点儿事。”

“你们两个伤着谁我都不希望，”罗斯玛丽临离开时说，“这场决斗愚蠢透顶，真应该想办法阻止才对。”





第十一章


罗斯玛丽下了楼，见坎皮恩待在空荡荡的前厅里。

“我看见你上楼了。”坎皮恩有些兴奋地说，“米基思科还好吧？决斗什么时候开始？”

“不知道。”罗斯玛丽感到有点恼火，觉得他说起决斗，就好像要去看马戏团表演一样，而米基思科则是节目中的悲剧性小丑。

“你跟我一起去吧？”他问道，那口气仿佛已经订好了看表演的座位，“我租了旅馆的汽车。”

“我不想去。”

“为什么不去？看人决斗也许会少活几年，但这样的机会我无论如何都不会错过。咱们可以从远处看嘛。”

“你为何不请邓弗里先生跟你一起去？”

坎皮恩不听则已，一听气得单片眼镜都掉了下来（衣服遮住胸毛，眼镜便没有了藏身之地），他挺直腰杆说道：“今生今世我都不愿再见他。”

“哦，这个嘛，反正我恐怕去不成。母亲会不高兴的。”

罗斯玛丽说完回房间去了。斯皮尔斯夫人睡眼惺忪地动了动身子，高声问道：“你上哪儿去了？”

“我睡不着，出去走了走。你继续睡吧，母亲。”

“你到我的房间来。”罗斯玛丽听见母亲坐起身叫她过去，于是便走进母亲的房间，把刚才发生的事情一五一十讲了一遍。

“为什么你不去看看呢？”斯皮尔斯夫人说，“你不必走近，但事后你可以帮帮忙呀。”

罗斯玛丽不喜欢看决斗的场面，心里一百个不愿意去。斯皮尔斯夫人还没有从睡梦中完全清醒过来，迷迷糊糊回忆起了往事——那时身为医生的丈夫还在，常有人夜间死亡或受伤，家属找上门来求丈夫去医治。这时，只听她对女儿说道：“我想让你单独闯荡世界，多见见世面。为雷尼拍宣传片时，比决斗更残酷的场面你可没少见。”

罗斯玛丽不明白为什么母亲要让她去看决斗，但她服从了母亲那坚定、清晰的声音——正是这个声音在她十二岁的时候把她送进巴黎奥德翁剧院的舞台入口处学舞蹈，出来时，还是这声音迎接她。

罗斯玛丽来到旅馆外边的台阶上，看见阿贝和米基思科乘车离去了，心想这下就不用去了。谁知旅馆的那辆汽车却从转弯处开了过来。路易斯·坎皮恩满脸喜色，大呼小叫地把她拉上车，让她坐在他的身旁，说道：“我躲着不叫他们看见，怕他们不让去。瞧，我还带了电影摄影机呢。”

罗斯玛丽无奈地笑笑，觉得他如此乐于去看别人决斗未免太糟糕了，而且不仅糟糕，简直有些丧失了人性。

“我感到奇怪，为什么米基思科夫人不喜欢戴弗夫妇？”她说，“他们待她可是相当好呀。”

“哦，问题的关键不在于待她好不好，而在于她究竟看到了什么。由于巴尔班的干涉，我们一直不知道到底发生了什么事。”

“原来你不是为这件事伤心？”

“噢，不是，”坎皮恩说着，声音都变了，“我是为回到旅馆后发生的另一件事伤心。不过，现在我不操那份心——彻底撒手不管了。”

说话间，他们的车跟着另一辆车向东行驶，沿着海岸经过瑞昂莱潘[33]，只见那儿有一家新的娱乐场正拔地而起。此时已四点多钟，蓝灰色的天空下，出海的第一批渔船正嘎吱嘎吱地出港驶向蓝绿色的大海。过了瑞昂莱潘之后，他们离开大路，朝偏僻的乡村开去。

“这是去高尔夫球场，”坎皮恩说，“我敢肯定他们是要到那儿决斗。”

他的话果然不错。阿贝的车在前面停了下来。这时，东方出现一抹红黄色，看来又是一个大热天。罗斯玛丽和坎皮恩让司机把旅馆的汽车开进松树林，他们俩藏在林中的阴影里，紧挨着那片高尔夫球场。在被太阳晒得发白的球道上，阿贝和米基思科来回踱着步，后者时不时地抬起头来，活像一只通过嗅气味来观察周围动静的兔子。不一会儿，远处的开球区有人影在晃动，罗斯玛丽和坎皮恩认出那是巴尔班和他的法国助手走了过来——那位助手的腋下夹着手枪盒。

米基思科有些惊惶，溜到阿贝身后，喝了一大口白兰地，随即借着酒劲迎了上去。但阿贝叫住了他，自己走上前去同那个法国人交谈。这时，太阳已跃出了地平线。

坎皮恩抓住罗斯玛丽的胳膊，用一种几乎让人听不见的声音叫道：“我受不了了！这太可怕了，会叫我……”

“你把手松开！”罗斯玛丽呵斥了一句，随后情绪激动地用法语念了一句祈祷词。

决斗双方面对面站定。巴尔班挽起袖子，两只眼睛在阳光下闪着亮光，显得有点急躁，不过他在裤缝上蹭手心时，动作倒还不紧不慢。米基思科喝了白兰地，显得无所畏惧，还噘起嘴吹了一声口哨，晃着大鼻子，完全一副天不怕地不怕的样子。阿贝拿着块手帕走上前去。那个法国助手把脸转向一旁。罗斯玛丽屏住呼吸，对米基思科顿生怜悯之情，对巴尔班却恨得牙根痒痒。

“一，二，三！”阿贝扯着嗓子喊道。

决斗双方同时开了枪。米基思科晃了晃身子，但随即便站住了。两个人都没有打中对方。

“行了，这就够了！”阿贝叫道。

决斗双方走到了一起。众人的目光都转向了巴尔班，看他有什么话说。

“我声明：这样的结果我不满意。”巴尔班说。

“什么？你当然满意了。”阿贝不耐烦地说，“你只是嘴上说不满意罢了。”

“你那位难道不愿意再打一枪？”

“你说的不错，是不愿意，汤米。你要决斗，我的当事人已经奉陪了。”

汤米轻蔑地大笑一声，说道：“这么远的距离真是太离谱了。搞这种闹剧实在叫人不习惯。你的当事人可别忘了这不是在美国。”

“你嘲笑美国是没有用的。”阿贝语气严厉地说了这么一句，但马上就换上了息事宁人的腔调，“该收手时就收手，汤米。”接着，他们交头接耳地说了一会儿话。末了，巴尔班点了点头，冲着那位刚刚跟他交过手的敌人冷冷地欠了欠身。

“不握一下手吗？”被请来照料伤员的法国医生提议说。

“他们彼此早就认识。”阿贝回答道。随后他对米基思科说：“走，咱们走吧。”

他们快步走开时，米基思科欣喜地紧紧抓住阿贝的胳膊。

“等一等！”阿贝说，“应该把汤米的枪还给他。他以后决斗时还要用呢。”

米基思科把手枪递了过去，粗声粗气地说：“让他见鬼去吧！你告诉他——”

“是不是让我告诉他，你还想再打一枪？”

“哼，该打的我已经打过了。”米基思科一边往前走，一边高声说，“我的表现可圈可点，难道不是吗？我可不是胆小鬼。”

“那你是个发酒疯的酒鬼。”阿贝抢白了他一句。

“不，我不是酒鬼。”

“好吧，好吧，就算你不是吧。”

“就算我喝了点酒，那又有什么关系呢？”

米基思科的自信心越来越强，愤怒地望着阿贝，又问了一声：“你说，那又有什么关系呢？”

“如果你硬是不承认，也就没有什么可说的了。”

“战场上每个人都是醉醺醺的，难道你不知道吗？”

“好了，咱们就忘了这事吧。”

然而，这件事并没有彻底结束。后边的树丛里响起一阵急促的脚步声，只见那个医生走了过来。

“对不起，先生们，”他气喘吁吁地说，“你们能不能把酬金付给我？当然，这是应该付给医生的费用。巴尔班先生只有一张一千法郎的大钞，兑不开，另一个人的钱包落在家里了。”[34]

“法国人就是爱打小算盘。”阿贝对米基思科说。然后他问医生：“多少钱？”

“让我来付这笔钱！”米基思科说。

“不用，我带了钱。我们处境都不太妙。”

阿贝把医生的辛苦费付给了他，而米基思科突然转身走进灌木丛里，在那儿呕吐起来。他的脸色比先前更为苍白了，不过同阿贝一起沐浴着玫瑰色的霞光向汽车走去时，却龙骧虎步、神情昂扬。

坎皮恩仰面躺在灌木林中大口喘气——在这次决斗中，唯有他一人被吓破了胆。罗斯玛丽突然爆发出一阵狂笑，用穿着便鞋的脚不停地踢他，一直踢得他醒过神来为止。此时此刻，她觉得别的什么都不重要了，只想着再过几个小时就又可以见到意中人了（在她的心目中，他们仍是她最初在沙滩上结识的“戴弗夫妇”）。





第十二章


罗斯玛丽和诺思夫妇、迪克·戴弗以及两个年轻的法国音乐家，共六个人，一道在沃伊津餐馆等候尼科尔。他们一边等一边观察餐馆里的其他顾客，看他们是否气度雍容。迪克夸了海口，说除了他以外，没有哪个美国人能在举止上做到从容不迫。大家伙正是要找一个典型例子予以反驳。但情形看来不妙——凡是进餐馆的人，不出十分钟，无不抓耳挠腮。

“男人实在不应该把上蜡的胡子刮干净。”阿贝说，“不过，迪克绝对不是唯一举止得体的人……”

“瞧着吧，我就是唯一的。”

“要说唯一，恐怕应该是镇定自若的人中唯一清醒的。”

正说着，只见一个衣着考究的美国男子携两个女伴走了进来。那两个女伴一进门就慌慌张张地冲过去占了一张餐桌。突然，那男子发觉有人在注视他，不由抬起手整了整领带，仿佛领带上鼓了个包一样。另有一群人走进来，还没有落座，其中的一个男子一个劲儿用手拍他那刮得光溜溜的脸颊，还有一个人手里拿着已熄灭的雪茄烟头，机械地忽而举起忽而放下。别的人即便没有这般举动，也会摆弄眼镜或拈胡须，而没有胡须的人则摩挲他们光溜溜的下巴，要不然就抓耳挠腮。

接着，一位大名鼎鼎的将军走了进来。阿贝断言此人在西点军校上过学，西点军校的第一学年不准任何学员打退堂鼓，要求之严令学员们终生难忘。阿贝跟迪克赌五美元，说此人一定举止得体。

只见将军两手自然垂放于身体两侧，耐心地等待座位。接着，他的胳膊突然向后一摆，姿势有点像跳水那样，惊得迪克叫出了声，以为他失去了控制，可是那位将军马上又恢复了原样，让大家松了口气。眼看危机就要过去，侍者把将军的椅子拉出来……

将军却突然抬起手，动作快得如流星赶月，猛地搔了搔他那纹丝不乱的灰白色头发。

“看到了吧？”迪克得意地说，“我就是唯一的。”

罗斯玛丽对此深信不疑。迪克意识到罗斯玛丽是他最忠实的听众，于是他谈笑风生，让他们这个小圈子洋溢着欢乐的气氛。一时间，罗斯玛丽竟将别的餐桌的顾客视若无物。他们虽说来到巴黎已经两天，但实际上他们好像仍觉得像躺在沙滩遮阳伞下那般。前天晚上他们一道参加了贵族军事院校的联欢舞会。罗斯玛丽曾参加过好莱坞上流社交界的晚会，相形之下便觉得军事院校的联欢舞会难以应对。迪克却如鱼得水，不断跟人寒暄（当然，他在结交朋友方面也是有选择的）。戴弗夫妇似乎交际很广，而每次见到朋友都很亲热，好像长时间没见十分想念一样，会显出一副惊讶的神情说：“喂，你们这一向躲到哪里去了？”接着重新组建自己的朋友圈子，对于外人则口气委婉但永久地谢绝入内。罗斯玛丽似乎很快也学会了区别对待——对于那些自己在不得意的时候认识的人，但后来她识破了他们，厌恶他们，将他们弃之不理。

他们的聚会有时美国味儿很浓，有时又没那么美式。迪克使他们恢复自我，任岁月蹉跎，也不知度过了多少个年头。

餐馆里光线暗淡、烟雾缭绕，餐架上的生鲜食品散发出的气味弥漫在空气中。正当大家伙望眼欲穿的时候，尼科尔翩然而至，穿一身天蓝色衣服，犹如一朵云飘了进来。从众人的目光可以看出，大家都在欣赏她的美丽，于是她粲然一笑以示感激。起初，大家温文尔雅，一副正人君子相，后来便有些忘乎所以，尽情打趣和相互嘲笑，最后还畅想未来，列了一大堆规划。他们具体都说了些什么、笑了些什么，过后谁都记不清楚，反正他们笑声不断。男人们把三瓶葡萄酒灌下了肚，三个女人则各有各的风度，堪称美国不同阶层妇女的代表人物——尼科尔是一位白手起家的美国资本家的孙女，也是利普·韦森菲尔德家族[35]一位伯爵的外孙女；玛丽·诺思是一位熟练的裱糊匠的女儿，同时也是泰勒总统[36]的后裔；罗斯玛丽则出身于中产阶级的中等阶层，被她的母亲送进好莱坞，提升到了一个意想不到的高度。这三个女性彼此相似，与许许多多美国其他女性却有着不同。她们与众不同之处在于：她们都喜欢跟男性打交道，周旋于男性世界里，而非游离其外，同时又保持独立的个性。她们不是根据自己的出身，而是凭着运气物色如意郎君——找到如意郎君，就变身为贤妻良母；找不到，则沦为混迹于上流社会的风尘女子。

罗斯玛丽觉得此次午餐气氛融洽，叫人心情愉快，部分原因在于午宴的人数——在座的只有七人，而这个数字是一个精彩午宴的极值。也许还有一个原因：她是这个圈子的新鲜血液，起到了催化剂的作用，使得圈内人彼此之间的龃龉一时消散。散席后，她请一位侍者将她引到了后边的一个昏暗的电话间里（法国餐馆的后边都有这样的电话间），借着橘黄色的灯光查了号码，随即给法美联合电影公司拨通了电话。对方说《父女情深》的拷贝他们肯定是有的，只是目前租了出去，但他们这个星期的晚些时候将会在圣安吉斯大街三百四十一号为她放映这部影片，让她到时候找克劳德先生即可。

电话间是个半隔间，紧邻衣帽间。罗斯玛丽挂上电话，听见五英尺远的一排衣服后面传来了两个人压低的声音。

“这么说，你还是爱我的？”

“当然爱，我对天发誓！”

罗斯玛丽听出女的是尼科尔，于是站在电话间门口犹豫了一下，不知该不该出去。

就在她犹豫不定时，却听到了迪克的声音：“我太想要你了，咱们现在就回旅馆去吧！”尼科尔轻轻地呻吟了一声。罗斯玛丽一时不知道他们在说什么，但从语气却可以听出所以然来。那两人神神秘秘的，这叫她心里一阵激动。

“我想要你。”迪克说。

“我四点钟回旅馆。”尼科尔说。

罗斯玛丽大气都不敢出地站在那儿，直到那两人说话的声音远去。起初，她甚至感到惊愕，因为据她观察那对夫妻并无如胶似漆的感情，相互之间比较淡漠。此时此刻，一股难以名状的激情传遍了她的全身。她不知自己对此是羡慕还是反感，只觉得自己的内心受到了深深的触动。回餐厅的路上，她感到孤零零的。不过，回想起刚才的情景，她心潮起伏——尼科尔那句充满激情的话“当然爱，我对天发誓！”久久回响在她心中。刚才目睹的一幕让她有一种特殊的情绪，尽管跟她本人关系不大，但回味起来，她内心感到那是合情合理、天经地义的，因而她绝无一丝一毫出演爱情片时所产生的那种厌恶感。

虽然这件事与她无关，可现在她却深陷其中。同尼科尔一起去购物时，她仍在思索迪克和尼科尔的约会，甚至比尼科尔本人更上心。她开始用新的眼光看待尼科尔，重新评估尼科尔的魅力，深深感到尼科尔是她所见过的最有魅力的女性——尼科尔端庄、虔诚、忠实，身上有一种含而不露的东西。她用母亲那种中产阶级的观点细细想来，尼科尔的这种素质也反映在了她对金钱的态度上。罗斯玛丽的钱是靠她自己努力奋斗挣来的——她之所以能来欧洲旅游，是因为她为了拍片子能够在一月份的大冷天一天往水里跳六次（她的体温一大清早便从99度上升到了103度[37]，后来还是母亲出面拦住了她）。

在尼科尔的指点下，罗斯玛丽用自己的钱买了两件衣服、两顶帽子和四双鞋子。尼科尔则按两页纸长的购物清单买东西，另外还买了些陈列在橱窗里的商品。她喜欢什么就买什么，而所购物品并非全都自己用，有些是送给一个朋友的。她买了彩色珠子、沙滩上用的折叠软垫、人造花、蜂蜜、客人用的床、皮包、围巾、鹦鹉、玩具房间中的小摆设以及三码长的对虾色新布料。她还买了十几件泳装、一条橡胶鳄鱼、一副黄金和象牙制成的旅行象棋、几块要送给阿贝的大号亚麻手帕和两件麂皮夹克（一件是翠鸟蓝色，一件是大红色，均购于爱马仕商店[38]）。她的购物观完全不同于上流社会的风尘女子——她们只买内衣和珠宝，说到底是购买职业装备或者说买保险品，而她在购物时则随心所欲。为了她，许许多多的人奉献出了聪明才智和辛勤的劳动。为了她，火车从芝加哥出发，穿过广袤的大地，抵达加利福尼亚；橡胶厂浓烟滚滚，各个工厂的传送带不停地运转；男工在缸里搅拌牙膏，从铜制的桶里汲取漱口剂；女工在八月里手脚麻利地将番茄酱装入罐头盒中，或在圣诞夜前夕的杂货店里忙得不可开交；印第安混血儿在巴西的咖啡种植园里辛勤劳作，一辆辆新型拖拉机在田间耕作（这些拖拉机不再是某些发明家独享的专利）。为尼科尔做贡献的人数量庞大，以上所述仅仅是其中的一部分。这是一个完整的体系，每个环节都干得热火朝天、轰轰烈烈，最后就有了尼科尔潇洒购物的场面——此时的尼科尔情绪亢奋，犹如一个面对熊熊燃烧的大火绝不退却的消防队员，脸上焕发出红光。她的人生准则非常简单，其中也隐含了她不祥的命运，只不过被她诠释得异常确切，显得典雅大方，势必会被后起之秀罗斯玛丽亦步亦趋地加以仿效。

快到四点钟的时候，只见尼科尔立在一家商店里，肩头站着一只鹦鹉，平时并不多话的她突然说出了一长串话：“那天你拍电影，要是不跳水就好了……对这种事情，我有时感到很纠结。第一次世界大战前我们家住在柏林，我当时十三岁，家母尚在人世。我姐姐要去参加一个宫廷舞会，请帖上列着三位王子的名字（这些都是皇帝的侍从一手安排的）。谁知就在动身前半小时，她突然感到下腹疼痛，发起了高烧。医生说她得了急性阑尾炎，需要做手术。但家母有她的打算，于是姐姐就在晚礼服下缚了一只冰袋去参加舞会，一直跳到两点，第二天上午七点才接受了手术。”

看来，自我约束不无好处；所有体面人物对自身都是很严格的。转眼到了四点钟，罗斯玛丽老想着此刻迪克在旅馆里等着尼科尔，于是盼着尼科尔赶快去，免得让他久等。她心里急得不得了，嘀咕着：“你为什么还不去呀？”突然，她冒出了这样一个念头：“你要是不愿去，就让我去好啦！”而尼科尔却不疾不徐，又进了另一家商店，为她俩买了紧身衣，还买了一件送给玛丽·诺思。直到这时，她才好像想起了什么似的，于是像是丢了魂般招手叫了辆出租车。

“再见，”她对罗斯玛丽说道，“今天很开心，你说是不是？”

“简直开心极了。”罗斯玛丽答道。说出这句话比她想象的要困难，当尼科尔乘车离去时，她整个身心都在表示抗议。





第十三章


迪克拐了个弯，踩着挡泥板继续顺着战壕朝前走，来到一架潜望镜跟前停下来，用它瞭望了一会儿，然后登上台阶，从胸墙上方放眼望去。前方灰暗的天空下是博蒙特哈默尔[39]，左边是带有悲剧色彩的蒂耶普瓦勒高地。他举起自己随身带来的野外双筒望远镜观望着前面的景象，觉得嗓子眼像被悲伤堵住了一样。

顺着战壕朝前走，他看见伙伴们在下一个转弯处等他，不由得心潮澎湃，想把心中的感受告诉他们，让他们了解那段历史，可是又觉得阿贝·诺思才是打过仗的人，而他却没有。

“那年夏天，这片土地每英尺就有二十个人阵亡。”他对罗斯玛丽说。后者听了，放眼看了看那光秃秃、没有多少绿色的平原，只能看见一些低矮的仅仅有六年树龄的小树。这天下午，即使迪克再补缀几句，说眼下他们正遭受炮击，她也会相信的。她对他的爱最终发展到这么一步，现在她已尝到了痛苦的滋味，开始感到绝望了。她茫然不知所措，想跟母亲讲一讲目前的状况。

“战后仍有许许多多的人死去，咱们不久也会长眠于地下的。”阿贝用宽慰的口气说道。

罗斯玛丽热切地等着迪克的下文。

“看见那条小河了吧？咱们两分钟就可以走到它跟前，而英国人抵达那里却花了一个月的时间。一个帝国前赴后继，缓慢地向前推进，而另一个帝国缓慢朝后撤退，一天撤退几英寸，战场上真是尸横遍野、血流成河。这一代欧洲人再也不愿打仗了。”迪克说道。

“还说这一代欧洲人呢！他们刚刚才平息了土耳其的战事，在摩洛哥又燃起了战火……”阿贝说。

“那是两码子事。在西线是不可能再打了，起码很长时间内都不会再有战争。年青一代就是想打，也打不起来了。若说第一次马恩河战役[40]那样的仗，他们还是可以打的，但绝对不是此处发生的这种。打这样的仗需要有虔诚的宗教信仰、深厚的经济基础和物资保障，还要有各阶层之间密切的合作。俄国人和意大利人在这些方面是成不了气候的。打这样的仗，你必须全身心投入，回顾那一长串记都记不全的历史。其中，你必须记住圣诞节，记住印有王储及其未婚妻肖像的明信片，记住瓦朗斯[41]的小咖啡馆、菩提树大街[42]的啤酒花园[43]以及市政厅的婚礼，记住自己曾去德比[44]看过赛马，记住你祖父的大胡子。”

“这样的战役是格兰特将军[45]一八六五年首创于彼得斯堡[46]。”

“才不是呢！他只是首创了大屠杀而已。若论首创者，应该是刘易斯·卡罗尔[47]、儒勒·凡尔纳[48]以及那个写《温蒂妮》的作者[49]，是喜欢打滚木球的乡村教堂执事、马赛的教母以及在符腾堡[50]和威斯特伐利亚[51]的小胡同里遭诱奸的少女。啊，这是一场爱之战，中产阶级百年的爱情倾泻于此。这是最后的一场爱之战！”

“你这是想把这场战役交给D.H.劳伦斯[52]论输赢。”阿贝说。

“一阵强烈的爱情暴风雨袭来，将我静谧的爱情安乐窝夷为了平地。”迪克有点伤感地继续说道，“你说是不是，罗斯玛丽？”

“我不知道，”罗斯玛丽一脸严肃地回答，“你应该是什么都知道的。”

这时，他们俩落在了其他人的后边。突然，土块和小石子雨点般向他们飞来。阿贝躲在另一个转弯处的后面大呼：“战争的幽灵又一次钻进了我的体内。我可是有俄亥俄州[53]百年爱情作为后盾的，等着我把这条战壕炸上天吧。”他从掩体后探出了头。“你们被炸死了……难道不懂战争游戏的规则吗？刚才扔的可是手榴弹呀。”

罗斯玛丽捧腹大笑。迪克抓起一把小石子要予以还击，但马上又扔到了地上，带着歉意说道：“恕我不能还击。银线已经剪断，金碗已经打破，[54]滔滔江水东流去，我这样一个浪漫主义者倍感无能为力。”

“我也是个浪漫主义者。”罗斯玛丽说。

他们走出那经过修复已变得齐整的战壕，来到一块悼念纽芬兰[55]阵亡将士的纪念碑前。罗斯玛丽读着碑文，热泪夺眶而出。像绝大多数女子一样，她的情绪也很容易受别人影响——她很想听听迪克的见解，以此判断哪些事物是荒唐的，哪些事物是可悲的。而此时她最渴望的是对方能洞悉她的心思，知道她在爱着他。可是现实颠覆了她的愿望——她怀揣一腔激动人心的爱情梦想，却行走在昔日的战场上。

离开纪念碑，他们坐上汽车启程返回亚眠[56]。一阵温润的毛毛细雨飘落在新栽的小树和低矮的灌木丛上。沿途可见各种六年前丢弃的东西，有哑弹、炮弹壳、炮弹、手榴弹、辎重、钢盔、刺刀、枪托和破烂的皮靴等，堆放在那里，就像火葬场的柴垛。在道路的转弯处，前边突然出现了一大片白色的坟头。迪克让司机把车停下，说道：“那个女孩在这儿呢，手里仍拿着花环。”

大家看着他下了车，目送他向女孩走去——那女孩手拿花环，心神不宁地站在墓地门口，而她的出租车司机在等着。她是个红头发的田纳西[57]姑娘，他们今天上午在火车上遇到过她。她来自诺克斯维尔[58]，是来给哥哥扫墓的。只见她脸上挂着恼怒的泪花，声音哽咽地对迪克说：“陆军部给我的号码肯定是错的，碑上是别人的名字。我从两点钟一直在找，可这么多的坟墓，哪能找得到。”

“我要是你，就不看碑上的名字，随便把花环献给哪一座坟都可以。”迪克建议说。

“你认为我应该这么做？”

“我想你哥哥会希望你这么做的。”

天渐渐暗下来，雨越下越大。女孩把花环放在了进门的第一座坟上，并接受迪克的建议，把她的出租车打发走，搭他们的汽车一起回亚眠。

女孩陈述的事情叫罗斯玛丽伤感，使得她又落下了眼泪。这实在是一个催人泪下的日子，她似乎知道了某些事的真相，只是那真相究竟是什么她却不甚了了。日后回想起来，这天下午整体来说还是一个令人高兴的下午——当时只觉得它平淡无奇，仅仅是连接过去和未来的一个环节，最后才发现它给人带来的是欢乐。

亚眠是座能勾起人回忆的紫色的城市，战争带来的那种凄凉气氛仍未散尽，就像巴黎火车北站和伦敦的滑铁卢车站那等地方一般令人伤感。白天，这样的城市让人沮丧——二十年前的那种狭小的有轨电车从大教堂前面铺有大块灰色卵石的广场驶过；就连天空似乎也带着过去的那种陈旧的味道，犹如旧照片一般黯然失色。但是天黑以后，街头便恢复了生机，呈现出法国生活中极为惬意的一面——烟花女子打扮得花枝招展；咖啡馆里有人在争论，唇枪舌剑，往来不休；情侣紧紧地相互依偎，飘然从街上走过，去寻找既省钱又舒适的过夜之地。迪克一行人坐在一个高大的拱廊下等火车——烟雾、嘈杂的说话声和音乐声从那高高的拱顶飘散出去。他们身边有一个管弦乐队在满怀激情地演奏《是的，我们没有香蕉》，乐队指挥看上去极为投入，似乎陶醉其中，于是他们为之拍手喝彩。那个田纳西女孩忘掉了悲伤，也高兴了起来，甚至还挤眉弄眼同迪克和阿贝调情。他们俩则善意地跟她开着玩笑。

后来，他们登上了去巴黎的火车，而那些符腾堡人、普鲁士近卫军、阿尔卑斯山地步兵、曼彻斯特磨坊主和昔日的伊顿公学[59]的学生则三三两两地继续在亚眠温润的雨雾中寻欢作乐，没完没了地过那种醉生梦死的生活。上车后，他们开始吃车站餐馆制作的夹有意大利香肠和贝尔培斯乳酪的三明治，喝法国的博若莱葡萄酒。尼科尔有些心不在焉，她烦躁地咬着嘴唇，翻看着迪克带来的战场游览指南——实际上，迪克一如既往地对这次游览做了深入研究，去其糟粕，取其精华，归纳为指南，手法有点像他平时举办晚会。





第十四章


到了巴黎，尼科尔十分疲乏，原计划去看规模宏大、美轮美奂的装饰艺术展览会，此时也就去不成了。伙伴们让她留在乔治王旅馆休息。当她通过灯光映照的玻璃门，身影消失在门厅的时候，罗斯玛丽有一种如释重负的感觉。尼科尔对她而言是一种压力——母亲对她也有压力，但母亲的压力是善意的、能够估摸到的，而尼科尔的压力叫她捉摸不透，让她有点害怕。

十一点钟，她和迪克以及诺思夫妇来到了塞纳河上一家新开张的船屋咖啡馆。桥上的灯光射在河面上，波光粼粼，似有无数个清冷的月亮在晃动。罗斯玛丽和母亲以前住在巴黎，有时她们会在星期天乘坐小轮船到叙雷讷去游玩，途中会谈到对未来的打算。虽然母女俩囊中羞涩，但斯皮尔斯夫人对罗斯玛丽的美貌抱有十足的信心，竭力在她心里培植雄心壮志，情愿把所有的钱都押在女儿的“亮点”上。罗斯玛丽在事业上一炮打响，回报了母亲的关怀……

自从来到巴黎，阿贝·诺思身上就老有一股淡淡的酒味，眼睛里布满血丝，可能是太阳晒的和喝酒喝的。罗斯玛丽发现他每到一处便开怀畅饮，真不知他太太玛丽·诺思怎么能受得了。玛丽很文静，除了常常会发笑，其他时候她总是静静的，因而罗斯玛丽对她了解很少。她喜欢将一头直直的乌发朝后梳，像是瀑布似的自然披散下来——那乌发会时不时地轻轻荡过鬓角，而就在快要遮住眼睛的时候，她会一甩脑袋，把头发又甩到后边去。

“阿贝，喝完这杯酒，咱们今晚早点儿回去吧。”玛丽的声音轻柔，但透出一丝烦愁，“你不要在这船上喝得太多。”

“天晚了，”迪克说，“咱们最好都走吧。”

阿贝板起他那端庄、高贵的面孔，露出一种固执的神情，以坚定的语气说：“不走，不能走。”说到这里，还特意停顿了一下，“不能走，现在还不能走。必须再来一瓶香槟。”

“我不能再喝了。”迪克说。

“不是让你喝，而是让罗斯玛丽喝。她天生能饮，她母亲说她在浴室里老放着一瓶杜松子酒……”

阿贝说着，把第一瓶里剩下的酒全倒在了罗斯玛丽的杯子里。罗斯玛丽来巴黎的第一天，因喝了几夸脱的柠檬水呕吐了一通，以后就再也没有喝过什么饮品，现在却重新开杯，喝起了香槟酒。

“这是怎么回事？”迪克嚷嚷道，“你可是说过不喝酒了呀。”

“我没说过永远不喝。”

“你母亲会怎么说呢？”

“我就喝这一杯。”罗斯玛丽说。她觉得自己有必要喝点酒——迪克喝了酒，虽不太多，但毕竟喝了，她认为自己喝了酒也许可以和他的关系更进一步，以此作为实现愿望的一个台阶。她喝得太猛，呛了几下，然后补充说道：“另外，昨天是我的生日——我已经十八岁了。”

“你怎么不告诉我们呢？”大家气愤地说。

“我不愿让你们为此张罗，费时又费力。”她将杯中的酒一饮而尽，说道，“这就算是庆祝了。”

“这当然不算数。”迪克斩钉截铁地说，“明天的晚餐是你的庆生宴，可别忘了。十八岁，这样的年华，该是多么重要啊！”

“我常想，十八岁以前，人生毫无意义。”玛丽说。

“是的，”阿贝表示同意，“过了十八岁也没什么意义。”

“阿贝觉得他的人生只有登上前往美国的轮船才会有意义。”玛丽说，“这次去纽约，他可是来真的，把一切都规划停当了。”她说话的口气似乎有点厌烦，就好像这一席话对她而言只是毫无意义的空话，仿佛她和丈夫的人生追求，或者说是失败了的尝试，已经成了一场空梦。“他将在美国创作歌曲，我则到慕尼黑唱歌。一旦我们夫妻团圆，就可以叱咤风云，无往而不胜了。”

“那真是太好了。”罗斯玛丽有了一点醉意，附和道。

“来，再给罗斯玛丽倒一杯香槟酒。再来一杯，她就可以摸清淋巴结的活动规律了——淋巴结是在十八岁才开始发生作用的。”阿贝说。

迪克宽厚地朝阿贝笑笑。他喜欢阿贝，但早已对他不抱希望了。接着迪克说道：“从医学的角度来说，这是错误的。咱们还是走吧。”

阿贝听出他有一丝居高临下的意思，于是淡淡说道：“我有预感，不等你把科学论文写出来，我的新曲子就会在百老汇亮相了。”

“但愿如此，”迪克心平气和地说，“但愿如此。我甚至愿意搁笔，不写你所说的‘科学论文’了。”

“别这样，迪克！”玛丽叫出了声，声音里含着诧异和震惊。罗斯玛丽以前从未见过迪克脸上这般毫无表情，觉得他宣布的这项决定非同小可，禁不住跟玛丽一道叫出了声：“别这样，迪克！”

但迪克突然又大笑一声，说道：“不写这篇论文，可以写另一篇嘛。”他说着从桌旁站起了身。

“迪克，请你坐下。我想知道……”

“改日再说吧。再见，阿贝！再见，玛丽！”

“再见，亲爱的迪克。”玛丽微笑着说。此时，船屋咖啡馆里几乎已没有了顾客，而她似乎很愿意继续待在这条空船上。她是个勇敢的、有前途的女子，如今嫁鸡随鸡嫁狗随狗，跟着丈夫走南闯北，不断改变着自己，却丝毫不能对丈夫如何选择人生道路产生影响。有时回想起自己暗地将前程寄托在这么一个丈夫身上，未免有一些灰心丧气。不过，她身上总是罩着一层吉祥之气，仿佛她本身是一种象征……





第十五章


“你要放弃的是什么论文？”在出租车里，罗斯玛丽热切地望着迪克问道。

“小事一桩，不值得一提。”

“你是个科学家？”

“我是个医生。”

“哦，是吗？”罗斯玛丽高兴地笑了起来，说道，“我父亲也是个医生。那你为什么不……”她没把话说完，就顿住了话头。

“没有什么神秘的。我可不是在事业的高峰弄出了什么丑闻，灰溜溜躲到了里维埃拉，只是暂时歇业罢了，说不定哪一天又重打锣鼓另开张了。”

罗斯玛丽仰起脸静静地等着迪克吻她。他看了她一会儿，好像不太明白她的意思似的，随后伸出一只胳膊搂住她，用面颊在她柔嫩的脸上蹭了蹭，接着又低头久久地端详她。

“真是一个乖巧、可爱的孩子。”他正色说。

罗斯玛丽嫣然一笑，两只手习惯性地抚弄着他衣服上的翻领，说道：“我爱上你和尼科尔了。其实，这是我的秘密……我甚至不想同别人谈论你，因为我不愿意再有人知道你是多么出色。老实说……我爱你和尼科尔……真的。”

这种话迪克不知道听过多少回了，甚至觉得调子都是一样的。

突然，她朝他挨了过来。迪克凝视着她，顿时感到两人之间年龄的差异消失了，于是便喘着粗气热烈地吻她，仿佛管不上她只是个小女孩了。

可就在这时，罗斯玛丽往后一缩身子，依然偎在他怀里，叹了口气说：“我已经决定放弃你了。”

迪克吃了一惊，不知道自己说了什么错话，让对方误以为已经拥有了他。

“我刚刚来了兴头，你这样可不地道。”他故作轻松地说。

“你都不知道我有多爱你……”就好像爱了许多年一样，她说得动情，声音都有点哽咽了，“你都不知道我有多爱你！”

迪克真想哈哈大笑，可是却没有笑出声，只是心里在想：“你不但长得漂亮，而且善于逢场作戏。谁不知道你的一举一动都是装出来的——或佯作陷入情网，或假装满脸羞涩。”

昏暗的出租车里，罗斯玛丽香气袭人（她身上洒的是和尼科尔一起买的香水）。只见她又偎了过来，紧紧贴在迪克身上。迪克吻了她，但心里却没有喜悦感。他知道对方并非没有激情，可是觉得对方的激情丝毫没有展现在她的美眸中或芳唇上，只能闻得到她的娇喘里有一股淡淡的香槟酒的味道。她不顾一切地紧紧抱住他，于是他又吻了她，但这一次感到一阵心寒，因为对方的吻虽然是天真无邪的，可是在接吻时她的眼睛却望着他身后那茫茫的夜色，望着那漆黑一团的世界。她还不明白，要爱就应该用一颗心去爱。等到她明白过来，全身心地融入充满深情的爱河之中，那时他就可以不假思索、无怨无悔地拥有她。

罗斯玛丽在旅馆的房间位于迪克夫妇房间的斜对面，更靠近电梯间。当二人走到她的门口时，她突然说道：“我知道你不爱我……我也不抱有这个奢望。你曾说我应该把我的生日告诉你，现在你也知道了。我想让你到我的房间里来，就算你送给我的生日礼物吧。我有话要对你说。就一会儿。”

他们走进房间，迪克随手关上了门。罗斯玛丽紧挨着他站着，没有碰他。这个夜晚的经历使她的脸色不再红润——只见她脸色十分苍白，像是舞会结束后被遗弃的一枝白色康乃馨。

“你笑的时候，我好像总能看见你的牙床那儿有个豁口——那是你掉乳牙留下的。”迪克说话时恢复了父辈的口吻，也许是因为尼科尔就在近旁的缘故吧。

谁知他话刚落音，罗斯玛丽就凑上前，紧紧贴在他身上，以悲哀的语气低声说：“拿去吧。”

“拿去什么？”

迪克惊呆了，如木雕石塑般站在那儿。

“动手吧，”她喃喃细语道，“啊，求你动手吧，该怎么做就怎么做。即使我不喜欢这种事，我也不会在意的……我从未有过这种欲望，每次想起来就讨厌，可现在我不会讨厌的，而是渴望你这样做。”

罗斯玛丽对自己感到吃惊，万万想不到她会说出这种话来，仿佛置身于十年修女般的生活中读到、电影里看到及梦里遇到的情境中。蓦然，她觉得她这是在扮演一个绝妙的角色，于是便满怀激情地投入了进去。

“不应该出现这种情况。”迪克老成持重地说，“是不是酒喝多了，管不住舌头了？不管怎样，全当没说吧。”

“不，不是那回事。我想让你马上这样做，占有我，为我指点迷津。我是你的，完完全全是你的——这是我心里的愿望。”

“有一点你考虑过没有？你知道这会给尼科尔造成多大伤害吗？”

“她不会知道的。这是我和你的事情，跟她无关。”

迪克听了，温和地接口说：“可我爱尼科尔，这是事实。”

“你可以爱更多的人，而不仅仅局限于一个人，难道不可以吗？这就像我爱我母亲，同时也爱你——现在，我对你的爱更深一分。”

“另外，其实你并不爱我。也许你以后会爱上我，而那时你的生活会变得一团糟。”

“不会的。此事发生以后，我保证再也不跟你见面。我会带上母亲马上回美国。”

迪克执意不肯，但看到她那年轻漂亮的脸蛋和粉嫩的芳唇，心里很不忍，于是便换了一种语气说：“你这是感情用事，一时冲动而已。”

“啊，求你了，即使让我怀孕，我也不在乎。我可以像电影里的女孩一样，到墨西哥去生孩子。这跟我想的完全不同——以前那些男演员吻我，总让我感到讨厌。”（迪克看得出她一门心思要干那种事。）“那些男演员，有的牙齿又大又丑。而你却不同，是如此英俊潇洒。我渴望你把这件好事做成。”

“你可能认为这种事仅仅是亲一亲、吻一吻而已，意思是让我吻一吻你？”

“嗬，别跟我逗了，我又不是三岁小孩。我知道你压根就不爱我。”罗斯玛丽说到此处，突然感到有些自卑，平静了下来，“我也没抱这种奢望。我很清楚，我在你眼里是微不足道的。”

“一派胡言！我只是觉得你年纪太小罢了。”迪克嘴上这么说，心里却在说：“要学的还多着呢。”

罗斯玛丽在焦急地等待着，呼吸也变得急促了，可是却听对方说道：“缘分不到，恐怕也就不能如你所愿了。”

她沉下了脸，满肚子的委屈和失望。迪克不假思索地说：“你我必须理智……”他把话说了半截就咽了回去，随她走到床跟前，在她身旁坐下，而她泪流满面。他一下子困惑起来，倒不是为这件事的道德问题而困惑，因为从各方面来看，此事都万万不可为。此时此刻，他心里一片茫然，平日的儒雅风度以及处事安然若素的能力一时间全都跑到了爪哇国里。

“我早就知道你不会愿意的，”她哭哭啼啼地说，“这本来就是个渺茫的希望。”

他站起身来说：“晚安，孩子。十分抱歉和遗憾。忘掉它吧，不要往心里去。”他说话的口气，就像医院里的护士劝病人好好睡觉一样，“你将会有许多追求者，最好在初恋时有清白之身以及纯洁的感情。你可能觉得这是老派的观念，是不是？”他说完抬腿向门口走去，而她望着他，感到非常纳闷，真不知他心里是怎么想的。只见他朝前又走了一步，步子迈得十分慢，还回头望了她一眼。刹那间，她真想冲过去拽住他，把他的嘴、耳朵、衣领等都吃了，把他整个人囫囵吞下肚。直到看见他将手按在门的把手上，她这才彻底放弃了，一头扑倒在了床上。房门关上后，她起身走到镜子那儿，开始梳理她的头发，一边轻轻抽噎着。像往常一样，她把头发一口气梳了一百五十下，接着又梳了一百五十下，一只胳膊酸了，就换上另一只胳膊，继续梳下去……





第十六章


一觉醒来，她心里已风平浪静，只感到无地自容。看一眼镜子里自己如花似玉的容貌，她却仍恢复不了自信，只是触动了昨日的伤痛。母亲给她转来一封信，是那个去年秋天带她去参加耶鲁毕业舞会的男孩写的，说他到了巴黎。然而这封信也不能帮她消除痛苦——那段记忆对她来说十分遥远。她走出房间去见戴弗夫妇，觉得一颗心沉甸甸的，备受煎熬。不过，见了面后，她和尼科尔一道去试衣服时，她就像尼科尔一样显得声色不露，叫人捉摸不透，像戴了一层面具。途中，尼科尔谈论到一个感情受挫的女售货员，说道：“大多数人都觉得别人很在乎他们的言行，其实不然。他们以为别人会在赞同他们和反对他们之间摇摆不定。”这番话叫罗斯玛丽很受用，觉得是一种慰藉。要是处于昨天那种亢奋的心境，她肯定会不以为然，可今天她恨不得将那件事忘干净，也就感到此话很入耳了。尼科尔的美貌和智慧令她欣羡，此时也破天荒地第一次叫她感到了嫉妒。记得在临离开高斯旅馆之前，她母亲曾以漫不经心的口气说尼科尔是个大美人。她当时觉得母亲的话太直白，意思是说她和尼科尔相比还算不上美人。不过，她并没有因此而烦心，因为她最近明白她有她自己的动人之处——她的魅力似乎不是天生的，而是后天得来的，就像法语一样，是通过学习获得的。可坐在出租车里，她看着尼科尔，暗中拿自己同尼科尔比较，她觉得尼科尔身段袅娜，一张樱桃小口有时紧闭、有时微启，时刻都可能邂逅到浪漫的爱情。尼科尔年轻时是绝代佳人，年纪大了也会风韵不减，脸上的皮肤依然会平展如初——她简直就是个美人坯子！她有撒克逊人[60]的血统，白肤金发。以前她楚楚动人，一头金发如金色的云团，而今发色变深，让她看上去更是艳压群芳。

“我们在那儿住过。”罗斯玛丽突然指着圣佩雷斯大街的一幢房子说。

“这倒有些奇怪。因为我十二岁时，母亲、芭比和我曾在那儿住过一个冬天。”尼科尔指着街对面的一家旅馆说。望着那两幢灰暗的房屋，她们不由回想起了自己的少女时代。

“那时我们刚在湖边盖了森林别墅，正在过节俭日子。”尼科尔继续说道，“最起码，我和芭比以及家庭女教师过的是节俭日子，而我母亲则在周游世界。”

“我们那时也很节俭。”罗斯玛丽说道，但她很清楚“节俭”一词对她们而言有着不同的含义。

“我母亲提起那家旅馆总是斟词酌句，把它说成是一家‘小旅馆’……”尼科尔咯咯一笑，笑声仍是那么迷人，“我的意思是，她从不说那是一家‘廉价旅馆’。假如哪个阔气的朋友问起我们的地址，我们从不说：‘我们住在贫民区的一个脏兮兮的小窝里，那儿有自来水就很不错了。’我们会说：‘我们住在一家小旅馆。’仿佛所有的大旅馆对我们来说都太吵闹，太俗气。当然喽，朋友们总是能识破我们，见人就嚼舌头。但母亲却不在乎，总说这证明我们了解欧洲，而这就是欧洲的民情。她当然了解欧洲啦，因为她是德国公民嘛。不过，她的母亲是美国人，而她自己则是在芝加哥长大的，因而，与其说她是欧洲人，不如说她是美国人。”

她们两分钟后要去见其他人，便在卢森堡公园对面的古伊尼莫大街下了车。下车时，罗斯玛丽重新调整了一下心态。她们这是到诺思夫妇家聚餐——诺思夫妇住在公寓楼的高层，下面是一片绿树，屋里空荡荡，没有什么家具。罗斯玛丽今天的心情已不同于昨天——她和迪克见面时，二人的目光相遇后又匆匆掠过，犹如鸟儿振翅一飞而过。之后，一切都顺顺当当的，气氛非常好。她知道迪克正在悄悄地爱上她，于是感到无比幸福，觉得爱的暖流在全身涌动。一种坚定不移、清晰可辨的自信在增长，在她的心头欢快地歌唱。她几乎不看迪克，但她知道一切都顺风顺水。

饭后，罗斯玛丽同戴弗夫妇以及诺思夫妇一起去法美联合电影公司，在那儿见到了那个叫科利斯·克莱的青年。此人是罗斯玛丽的朋友，来自于纽黑文市[61]，是罗斯玛丽打电话约来的。他是佐治亚[62]人，尽管在北方受教育，思想观念却仍是南方的，传统、保守，甚至有些刻板。去年冬天，她还认为他很有魅力，两人曾手拉着手从纽黑文乘坐汽车到了纽约。而现在她的眼里已经没有他了。

在放映室里，罗斯玛丽坐在科利斯·克莱和迪克的中间。放映员在装《父女情深》的胶片，一位法国管理人员围着她打转，时不时说几句美国俚语。“是的，孩子。”放映机卡壳时，只听他说道，“祸来啦，这下可没辙了！”后来，灯光熄灭了，咔嗒咔嗒一阵响，电影准备放映了。罗斯玛丽终于可以和迪克静静地待在一起了——在半明半暗的放映室里，二人你看着我，我看着你。

他们肩挨着肩。迪克嘴里在喃喃低语：“啊，亲爱的罗斯玛丽。”尼科尔在这排座位的边上，有点坐立不安，而阿贝又是咳嗽，又是擤鼻子。后来，所有的人都安静了下来，电影开始放映。

罗斯玛丽出现在了银幕上——那是一年前的她，一副学生模样，头发披散在背后，一绺一绺，硬撅撅的，就像塔纳格拉[63]陶俑的头发。啊，她是多么年轻，多么天真无邪，完全是她母亲精心呵护出来的纯情少女！只见她在专注地剪纸板娃娃，尽显少女纯真的天性，心里没有一丝一毫的邪念。她至今仍记得当年穿着那身洋溢着青春气息的丝绸衣服时内心的感受——她那时觉得自己充满了朝气和激情。

作为《父女情深》里的主角，她是不是勇敢无畏，经历了许多磨难？她是那么甜蜜，那么可亲可爱，她难道不可爱吗？她一挥小拳头，便将骄奢淫逸、腐化堕落一扫而光。在她的面前，就连命运女神也退避三舍，于是便出现了柳暗花明的奇迹——什么三段论啦辩证法啦，什么合理不合理啦，全都遁形匿迹了。正在家中洗碗的家庭妇女看了这样的镜头，一定会忘情地潸然泪下。别说家庭妇女，甚至就连影片里的一个女子也哭成了泪人儿，差不多把罗斯玛丽的镜头都抢走了。那女子在耗资不菲的场景里哭个不停——她在邓肯·法福[64]餐厅里哭，在机场和只拍了两个镜头的快艇比赛中哭，在地铁里哭，最后还在浴室里哭。然而，罗斯玛丽光彩照人，仍是核心人物。她表现出善良的性格、不畏艰险的勇气以及坚定的决心，不管庸俗世人的冷嘲热讽。她所展现的是一副尚未脸谱化的面容，简直感人至深，观影期间令所有的人都心潮澎湃、感情跌宕起伏。中间休息的时候，灯亮了起来，大家对她报以热烈的掌声。迪克心悦诚服地对她说：“我简直太吃惊了。你一定会成为银幕上的翘楚，一颗闪亮的明星！”

休息后，大家继续观看《父女情深》。后半场演的是苦尽甘来的幸福日子，父女团圆的美好场景表现出浓郁的恋父情结。迪克对心理学家的这种恶劣的多愁善感皱起眉来。电影放完了，灯亮了。时机到了。

罗斯玛丽趁着这个机会向大家宣布道：“我有一个小安排——安排迪克试镜。”

“什么？”

“一个试镜。他们要选一位演员。”

屋里一片寂静，连掉根针在地上都可以听得见。后来，诺思夫妇忍不住笑出了声。罗斯玛丽观察着迪克的脸色，看见他的脸像爱尔兰人那样抽搐了一下，于是知道他是明白她的苦心的。不过，尽管她毫不怀疑这是一张好牌，同时又觉得这张牌出的不是时候。

“我不想试镜。”迪克口气肯定地说。随后，他通盘考虑了一下眼前的处境，接着心平气和地说：“罗斯玛丽，我让你失望了。拍电影对一个女子来说不失为一个好职业，可对我却是赶鸭子上架。我仅仅是个迂腐的医生，只会在我的小天地里兜圈子。”

尼科尔和玛丽左右夹攻地讽刺他，劝他抓住这个机会，说的话夹枪带棒，二人因为自己没受到邀请而心生恼怒。后来，迪克引用评论演员的一段尖酸的话结束了这场风波：“门口戒备森严，门内却空空如也——也许，空空如也的状况透露出去会叫人颜面扫地。”

罗斯玛丽和迪克及科利斯·克莱同乘一辆出租车离去——把科利斯送到住处后，迪克要带罗斯玛丽去赴一个茶会。因为有事（那是一些阿贝·诺思拖到最后才想起来要做的事情），尼科尔和诺思夫妇不能去参加茶会。

在出租车里，罗斯玛丽对迪克发起了牢骚，说道：“我本来想让你试镜，效果好了，我就可以把片子带到加利福尼亚去。他们要是喜欢，你就能脱颖而出，在我演的片子里当男主角。”

迪克大为感动，说道：“你真是一片热心肠。不过，我看你演就够了。你演得好极了，是我看过的最棒的演员。”

“《父女情深》的确是一部好片子。”科利斯说，“我看过四遍了。据我所知，纽黑文有个男孩看了十二遍——有一次他竟然一路赶到哈特福德[65]去看这部电影。可是，我带罗斯玛丽去纽黑文的时候，他却害羞得不敢见她。你能想得到吗？这个小姑娘把他们全都镇住了。”

迪克和罗斯玛丽四目相对，很想单独谈谈，但科利斯硬是不理解他们的心思，他说道：“我住在鲁特西亚旅馆，先送送你们吧。”

“还是我们送你吧。”迪克说。

“我送你们更方便些，一点也不费事的。”

“我觉得最好还是我们送你吧。”

“但是……”科利斯刚想再说些什么，却突然明白了过来，于是话锋一转，开始同罗斯玛丽商量下次见面的时间。

最后，他终于下了车——一个影子一样无足轻重，但十分讨人嫌的第三者离去了。后来，不知怎的，出租车按照迪克给的地址停在了一个处所，这叫罗斯玛丽颇感意外。迪克长长地吸了一口气，说道：“愿意进去吗？”

“我无所谓，你说怎样就怎样。”罗斯玛丽答道。

迪克想了想说：“反正我得进去坐坐。她想买我一个朋友的几幅画，而那位朋友手头紧，正缺钱。”

罗斯玛丽用手理了理弄乱的头发，表示愿意奉陪。

“咱们只待五分钟。”迪克做出了决定，说道，“那些人你不会喜欢的。”

听他这么一说，罗斯玛丽猜想屋里肯定是些乌七八糟的人，或枯燥乏味、古板呆滞，或低级趣味、酗酒成性，或招人讨厌、纠缠不休，都是些戴弗夫妇避之唯恐不及的人。至于进屋后见到的是怎样的场景，她事先是一点心理准备都没有的。





第十七章


这幢房屋在风格上仿照位于木樨街的红衣主教莱兹的宫殿，可是一进门，罗斯玛丽就发现里面全无怀古的幽思，也无现代的情调。房屋砖石结构的外壳似乎给人以面向未来的超前感，一迈入门槛（如果可以被称为门槛的话），步入一个长长的大厅，那儿有许多蓝色的钢架和镀银的架子，还有许多古里古怪的棱镜，你会有触电的感觉，产生焦躁不安的情绪，还会觉得反胃，就好像早餐吃下了难以下咽的燕麦和麻药一样。这种感觉却跟你在装饰艺术展览会的展览厅里的那种感觉完全不同——在展览厅里，你是身在其中，而非像现在这般站在镜子面前出洋相。罗斯玛丽有一种戏中人的感觉，必须得装模作样，估摸着其他的人八成跟她感受相同。

屋里大约有三十个人，其中多为女性，个个都像是路易莎·梅·奥尔科特[66]或塞居尔夫人[67]创造出来的艺术形象——这些人谨小慎微，一举一动都准确无误，就像是用手捡玻璃碴，生怕被扎伤。他们当中的每一个人，或者说整个群体似乎都无法掌控周围的环境，不能像支配属于自己的艺术品那样；不管周围的环境怎样神秘，他们都无可奈何——无人知道这个大厅究竟意欲何为，因为它变化莫测，正在悄然改变着性质，似乎已经不是大厅了。你来到这里，会觉得步履维艰，每一步都得小心翼翼，就像走在十分光滑的活动楼梯上。除非你具有以上所说的用手捡玻璃碴的那种本事，否则别想行动自如——这里的大多数人正是受到这种限制，才有了如此窘境。

这些人按类型可分为两种。在第一种类型里，有美国人，也有英国人——这些人在春光明媚的时候，以及在融融的夏日，会纵情狂欢，一味追求精神刺激。这种人有的时候会非常安静，甚至可以说是蔫了吧唧，而有的时候则突然爆发出活力，四处惹是生非，不是与人争执，就是行拐骗之事。第二种类型可以被称为剥削者，靠剥削他人为生，相对而言比较沉着、冷静，有着自己的人生目标，不愿虚度光阴，此时在这个大厅里尚能保持情绪稳定。如果说这个大厅光怪陆离，很有特色，那么，这种特色来自于第二种类型的人。

这个“弗兰肯斯坦”[68]一口将迪克和罗斯玛丽吞进了肚子里，然后立刻就把他们分开了。罗斯玛丽突然觉得自己成了一个不知所措的小人物，张口结舌不知说什么才好，希望有人能过来为她指点指点。不过，大厅里慌乱不知所措的非止她一人，这叫她觉得自己并不比别人更尴尬。另外，她的训练发挥了作用，做了几个半军事化的动作——辗转腾挪，她终于走到了一个地方。她发现自己看似在和一个女孩说话——一个生得齐整的乖巧女孩（该女孩有一张英俊少年的脸），实际上她被说话的声音吸引了——斜对面四英尺远的金属楼梯口那儿有人在交谈。

那儿的长椅上坐着三位年轻女子，个个身材修长、腰肢纤细，小头小脑，戴着模特那样的头饰，身穿黑色时装，说话时脑袋一摆一摆的，很是优雅，像长茎上的花朵，也有点像眼镜蛇的脑袋。

“哼，他们可真是够显赫的，”其中的一个女子说道，嗓音低沉、圆润，“在整个巴黎，他们恐怕是最爱出风头的了。这一点是谁都不能否认的。可毕竟……”说到这里，她叹了口气，“那些话他说了又说……岂不知‘话说三遍淡如水’。只能叫人付之一笑。”

“我比较喜欢生活中经历风雨的人。”又有一个女子说道，“对于她，我是不喜欢的。”

“说实在的，对他们两口子我历来都不十分感兴趣，对他们的朋友也是如此。比如说，那个贪杯好饮的诺思先生就是其中的一个。他来了吗？”

“他没来。”头一个说话的那个女子回答道，“不过，若论魅力，你得承认那些人能拔头筹。”

罗斯玛丽这才听出她们原来正在谈论戴弗夫妇，于是气得连身子都僵硬了。说话的那女子身穿浆得笔挺的蓝色衬衫、灰色外套，有一双亮晶晶的蓝眼睛，脸蛋红扑扑的，活脱脱一个广告女郎，她一见罗斯玛丽便大献殷勤，将挡在她们之间的东西一件件推开，生怕罗斯玛丽看不见她。最后，罗斯玛丽看到的是她的一副虚伪的嘴脸，心里感到十分厌恶。

“我想请你吃顿午饭或晚饭，后天也行。你肯不肯赏脸？”那女子以央求的口气问。罗斯玛丽没吱声，而是用目光四下寻找迪克，最终发现他和女主人在一起（他一进来，就一直在跟女主人说话）。二人目光相遇，迪克冲她微微点了点头。与此同时，那三个脑袋像眼镜蛇的女子用挑剔的目光打量她，而她也毫不示弱地盯着她们，好像在说她听见了她们刚才的言语。后来，她礼貌且果断地说了声再见，结束了这种冷峻的对峙，到迪克那儿去了——这样摆脱窘境的招数是她刚跟迪克学来的。那个女主人有高挑的个子，是个美国的富家女，逍遥自在地享受着国家繁荣所带来的财富，此时在向迪克打听高斯旅馆的情况，问这问那的，显然是想在那儿下榻。尽管迪克不愿多说，她仍一个问题接一个问题。直至罗斯玛丽走到跟前，她才感觉到自己没有尽到地主之谊，于是向四周看了看，对罗斯玛丽说：“你有没有看见哪个风趣的人，可以跟他……”她一边说一边想找到一位能让罗斯玛丽感兴趣的男士，但迪克说他们必须走了。随后，他和罗斯玛丽立刻走掉了，跨过那道象征着未来的门槛，一步就迈到了代表着过去的石头大门前。

“是不是很糟糕？”迪克问。

“是的。”罗斯玛丽小鸟依人般地回答道。

“罗斯玛丽？”

“怎么啦？”她喃喃地问，声音怯怯的。

“我心里很乱，觉得很糟糕。”

她的身子哆嗦着，痛苦地啜泣了几声，声音清晰可闻。“你带手帕了吗？”她嗓音发颤地问。此刻哪里有伤心落泪的时间！这对情侣很快就沉浸在爱河中不能自拔，贪婪地利用那分分秒秒飞逝的时光。车窗外，那绿色和奶油色相间的暮色渐渐隐没，街上亮起了霓虹灯，有火红色的、淡蓝色的，也有幽灵般绿色的，在静静的雨雾里闪闪烁烁的。此时已经快六点钟了，街上行人熙攘，各家餐馆灯火通明。他们乘坐的出租车转弯向北，从沐浴在粉红色灯光里的协和广场跟前疾驰而过。

最后，二人终于彼此分开，忘情地看着对方，嘴里念叨着对方的名字——那两个名字像具有魔力一样，轻轻地、久久地荡漾在空气里，比任何别的名字都要缠绵，甚至比绕梁的音乐还难以消散。

“我都不知道昨天晚上自己到底是怎么回事。”罗斯玛丽说，“莫非是喝酒喝糊涂啦？以前我可从来没有那样过。”

“没什么，你只不过说了声你爱我。”

“我确实爱你，欲罢不能。”这时，罗斯玛丽总算可以哭一场了。只见她拿出一方罗帕，呜呜咽咽哭了一通。

“恐怕我也爱上你了，”迪克说，“这可不是一件好事情。”

随后，二人又念叨起对方的名字来。接着，他们倒在了一起，就好像车身一颠，将他们颠在了一处似的。她的酥胸紧紧贴在他的身上，温暖的樱桃小口香津津的，此刻属于他们二人。他们快活得忘乎所以，什么都不想，什么都不看，只是喘着粗气，恨不得将对方吞进肚里。此时的他们略感疲惫，在一个温柔的世界里休憩，犹如紧绷的琴弦松弛了下来，似柳条椅般嘎吱嘎吱响。他们的神经敏感、脆弱，必须从对方那儿寻求安慰，于是便嘴对嘴、胸贴胸……

二人沉浸在爱情的幸福之中，彼此对对方都产生了种种幻想，种种不切合实际的幻想，由于心灵水乳交融，已全然不顾其他的人际关系。他们达到这种境界，似乎是出于天真和无知，是阴差阳错走到了一起——由于诸多偶然事件的发生，他们才认定彼此是相爱的。他们达到这种境界是清清白白的（或者说看起来如此），事先并无花前月下的约会，也无耳鬓厮磨的偷情。

不过，对迪克而言，这样的爱情历程很短——还没到达旅馆，他的爱情就转了弯。

“真是无能为力啊，”他神情慌乱地说，“我爱你，但我昨晚所说的事实却是改变不了的。”

“这没有关系。我只是要你爱我——只要你爱我，一切都好办。”

“不幸的是我确实爱你，但不能让尼科尔知道——甚至不能叫她有丝毫的怀疑。我和尼科尔必须一同生活下去。从某种程度上说，这可不仅仅是愿意不愿意的问题。”

“请你再吻我一次吧。”

他吻了她，但一颗心却在瞬间远离了她。

“不能让尼科尔受到伤害……她爱我，我也爱她……这你应该是理解的。”

她当然理解，正因为理解，才不愿伤害他们。一开始她就知道戴弗夫妇彼此相爱，但也知道他们之间的爱是冷静的爱，就跟她与母亲之间的感情相似。人与人之间这样对外来者的爱是不是表明人的内心缺乏炽热的激情？

“我爱尼科尔，”他猜透了她的心思，于是解释道，“是发自于内心的爱。这种感情很复杂，说是说不清的。那场疯狂的决斗就是由这样的感情所引发的。”

“那场决斗你是怎么知道的？我以为这事是瞒着你的。”

“你以为阿贝能保守秘密？”他语含讥讽地说，“你可以把秘密告诉给广播电台，或把它登在街头小报上，但千万不要把它告诉给一个每天至少要醉三四次酒的人。”

她笑着表示同意，同时朝他怀里偎了偎。

“这样你就知道我和尼科尔的关系是错综复杂的。她看上去是个坚强的人，其实并非如此。正是这一点让问题复杂化了。”

“哦，这些以后再说吧！现在，亲亲我吧，爱我吧！我将会悄悄地爱你，决不让尼科尔看见。”

“你真善解人意。”

说话间，他们已经到了旅馆。罗斯玛丽慢行几步，落在了他后边，从后边欣赏着他，心里充满了崇拜。但见他脚步轻盈，仿佛刚完成了一件大事，现在正奔向前方去执行新的重大使命。好一个寻欢作乐的高手，婚姻幸福的呵护人！他头戴一顶精致的帽子，手戴一副黄色手套，拎着一根沉甸甸的手杖，真是风度翩翩！她不由心想：如果今夜能跟他共度良宵，该是多么令人销魂啊！

他们上楼去，中间要爬五段楼梯。在第一段楼梯口，他们停下脚步接吻；在第二段楼梯口，她接吻时就比较谨慎了；在第三段楼梯口，她便更谨慎了。在爬第四段楼梯时，她中途留住脚步，飞快地和他吻别。但在他的恳求下，她陪他又回到下面的那个楼梯口，缠绵了一会儿之后，复又拾级而上。最后，二人伸出手，顺着楼梯的栏杆握别，随即各自将手抽回。迪克下楼去为晚上的聚会做些安排；罗斯玛丽跑回自己的房间，着手给她母亲写信。她觉得内疚，因为她方才完全把母亲忘到了九霄云外。





第十八章


戴弗夫妇对于赶时髦、追时尚并不感兴趣，但他们嗅觉灵敏，愿意随着时尚的节奏和韵律前行——迪克圈子里的人都喜欢热闹，如果在寻欢作乐的空隙有机会呼吸一下夜晚清新的空气就更好了。

这天晚上的聚会简直就是一场闹剧，变化多端，先头有十二个人，后来变成十六个，四人一组乘车在巴黎兜风。一切就像是在预料之中，不时有人加入他们的行列，好似变魔术，以领队或导游的身份陪他们一程，然后销声匿迹，接着便另有人取代他们——似乎人人养精蓄锐一整天，就为了迎接这一时刻的到来。罗斯玛丽赞叹不已，觉得这样的聚会别出心裁，跟好莱坞的聚会大不相同，尽管后者气势恢宏。他们花样翻新，还弄来了一辆波斯国王的汽车。至于迪克是从哪儿搞来这部车子，用了什么贿赂手段，这些都无关紧要。罗斯玛丽欣赏的只是它新颖、稀奇的一面（这两年，在她的生活中，新颖、稀奇的玩意儿层出不穷）。这部车的底盘产于美国，是特制的，轮毂是银质的，散热器也是银质的。车厢里镶嵌了无数的人造宝石，当这辆车下星期抵达德黑兰时，这些人造宝石就会被宫廷珠宝匠用真正的珠宝替换。车子后面实际上只有一个座位，因为国王乘车外出必须一人独坐。于是，他们便轮流乘坐这辆车，坐在那铺满地板的貉皮上开开洋荤。

迪克无处不在，是核心人物。罗斯玛丽默默地对自己始终带在身边的母亲的肖像说：这天晚上的迪克简直棒极了，她从未见过如此风雅的人。她将迪克同跟前的几个人做了一番比较——无论是那两个被阿贝尊敬地称为“亨吉斯特少校和霍尔瑟先生”的英国人、一位斯堪的纳维亚的王储、一位刚从俄国回来的小说家，抑或热情洋溢、妙语连珠的阿贝，还是半途加入但一路陪伴的科利斯·克莱，没有一个能比得上迪克。迪克自始至终表现出蓬勃的激情和无私的奉献，让她着了迷。他施展个人魅力，热情地对待各种类型的人，似乎游刃有余，表现出高超的技巧，而其他人缺乏主动性，一味依赖他，就像一群士兵依赖给养。

事后回想起来，她觉得有几个时刻是她最幸福的时刻。首先，最叫她感到愉悦的是跟迪克翩翩起舞的时刻——她如花似玉、光彩照人，而迪克高大魁梧、身体健壮。他们脚步轻盈，舞姿优雅，仿佛置身于美丽的梦境之中。迪克带着她在舞场上这儿跳跳，那儿跳跳，巧妙地向二十五位看客展示她的美，就像展示一束艳丽的鲜花或一块华贵的锦缎。有一刻，他们停下舞步，只是紧紧地依偎在一起。清晨的那段时光，他们俩单独待着——在衣帽间紧紧拥抱，旁边挂着别人的帽子和外套，她把自己汗津津的搽过粉的年轻躯体紧紧贴在迪克的身上，将衣服弄得皱巴巴的。

而她笑得最开心的时刻则是在后面。当时他们一共六人，全都是昨晚聚会中的精英人物。大伙儿站在丽兹饭店昏暗的门厅里，告诉值夜班的守门人，说潘兴将军[69]就在门外，他要在门厅这儿吃鱼子酱、喝香槟酒，并强调说：“潘兴将军容不得拖拖拉拉的作风。他有人有枪，可不是好惹的。”不知从哪儿冒出来几个侍者，神情慌乱，七手八脚在门厅里摆了一桌酒菜。伪装成潘兴将军的阿贝大摇大摆走了进来，他们恭立迎候，唱了几句依稀记得的战歌。原来，他们几个是怪侍者虎头蛇尾，对他们冷热不均，觉得自己受到了慢待，这才设置了这么一个圈套——结果，门厅里所有的家具被集中起来，搭成了一张古里古怪的大餐桌，看上去像是戈德堡漫画[70]中怪异的机械装置。阿贝看了直摇头，说道：“也许，最好偷一把乐锯来……”

“够啦！”玛丽打断他的话说。接着，她焦急地对罗斯玛丽解释道：“阿贝该回家去了，可他还在玩这种把戏。必须叫他赶快回去。他要赶十一点钟的火车，免得误船。这很重要——我觉得他的整个前途就取决于能否赶上这趟火车。可是，每次我叫他干什么，他就偏不干，总是跟我唱对台戏。”

“我来劝劝他。”罗斯玛丽主动请缨。

“你？”玛丽怀疑地说，“也许你可以劝得动他吧。”

这时，迪克走到了罗斯玛丽跟前说：“我和尼科尔要回家了。你是不是愿意跟我们一起走？”

罗斯玛丽已经疲惫不堪，在昏暗的光线里显得脸色苍白，原本在日光下看上去红润的脸颊此时没有了光泽，有点暗淡。

可是她却说：“我不能走，因为我答应过玛丽·诺思要陪他们……如若不然，阿贝就不肯去睡觉。或许，你可以说得动他。”

“靠劝说是不顶用的。这道理你不明白吗？要是上大学，他是我的室友，如果是第一次耍别扭，劝劝他恐怕还顶用。现在你劝他，屁用都不顶。”迪克说。

“不管怎样，反正我得留下。阿贝说只要我们陪他逛一逛哈勒斯购物中心，他就睡觉。”罗斯玛丽带着一丝挑战的口气说。

迪克飞快地在她的胳膊肘内侧吻了一下。

“别让罗斯玛丽一个人回家，”他们两口子离开时，尼科尔朝玛丽喊道，“咱们要对她母亲负责。”

稍后，罗斯玛丽、诺思夫妇、一位来自纽瓦克的说话声奶声奶气的制造商、无处不在的科利斯以及一位名叫乔治·霍斯普罗泰克森的衣着华丽、油头粉面的大个子印度人，便一道坐上一辆满载着胡萝卜的菜市场卡车走了。一路上，在黑暗中可以闻到胡萝卜根须上的泥土散发出的阵阵清香。罗斯玛丽高高地坐在胡萝卜堆上面，几乎看不见同车的其他人——那几个同伴隐没在相距甚远的街灯之间的大片黑暗之中。那几个人说话的声音远远传来，仿佛他们跟她有着不同的感受，而且是截然不同的感受——她的心已飞到了迪克那儿，为自己陪诺思夫妇来而感到后悔，真希望自己此刻回到了旅馆，迪克就睡在对面的房间里，或者他就守在她身旁，和她一起待在这融融的、暖暖的黑暗中。

“别上来！”她冲着正要往上爬的科利斯叫道，“胡萝卜会滚下车的。”随后，她朝阿贝扔了一根胡萝卜——阿贝坐在司机旁边，呆呆的像个迟暮的老人……

她踏上归途时，天已大亮，看得见有一群鸽子在圣索皮尔教堂上空盘旋。大家开怀大笑——街上的行人看到的是一个晴朗、炎热的早晨，而他们几个人的思绪仍停留在昨天夜里。

“好一个狂欢之旅！”罗斯玛丽心想，“但是，迪克不在跟前，毫无乐趣可言。”

她觉得有点失落和伤感。就在这时，有一样活动的东西闯入了她的眼帘。原来那是一棵巨大的七叶树，开满了花，正被运往香榭丽舍大街，树身被绑在一辆长长的卡车上，但枝叶欢快地摆动着，似乎在笑——犹如一个可人儿，虽然处境尴尬，但对自己的魅力深信不疑。罗斯玛丽看得出了神，不由将自己比作了那棵树，也跟着快乐地大笑起来，刹那间觉得一切又是那般的美好。





第十九章


阿贝十一点从圣拉扎尔车站动身——他独自站在肮脏的玻璃穹隆顶下面，这还是十九世纪七十年代，即“水晶宫”[71]时代的产物。他的双手呈死灰色，只有二十四小时不休息的人才有这种颜色。他把手插进外衣口袋，不让人看见他的手在发抖。他摘掉了帽子，看得出只有头顶上的几绺头发梳到了后面，而下面的头发则倔强地披向两边。很难认出他就是两个星期前在高斯海滩游泳的那个阿贝了。

他早早地来了，转动着眼球左看看右看看，身体的其他部位却一动不动，仿佛一动就会精神失控似的。这时，有人拎着看上去簇新的行李包从他的身边走了过去。不一会儿，就见几个准备上车的旅客出现了，远处看是几个小小的黑影，扯着嗓门在叫：“喂，喂，乔勒斯！”

他心里在犹豫着，看是不是有时间到车站酒吧里去喝上一杯，同时用手摸到了口袋里的那卷湿漉漉的一千法郎的钞票。就在这时，他游移的目光落到了幽灵一般出现在楼梯口的尼科尔身上。他注视着她，见她脸上表情僵硬，皱着眉头，像是在想她的孩子似的，那表情与其说是在怀着舐犊之情爱抚孩子，倒不如说是像动物一样在清点幼仔，犹如母猫在清点小猫——人们在找人，却没有看见自己所要找的人时，脸上时常会有这样的表情。

她看见阿贝时，脸上的这种表情便消失了。晨曦凄凉，有着几分悲哀，而阿贝眼睛下面罩着黑圈，在晒红了的脸上清晰可见，使得他看上去有点落魄。二人在一张长椅上坐了下来。

“你要我来，所以我就来了。”尼科尔辩解似的说。阿贝似乎已经忘了为什么要叫她来；尼科尔一边说，一边悠闲地看着从跟前走过的旅客。

“你看见那个有许多男人来为之送行的大美女了吗？她一定会成为你们船上的一枝花！你知道她为什么要买那件衣服吗？”尼科尔越说越快，“你知道为什么除了周游世界的美人，没有其他人会穿这样的衣服吗？知道吗？不知道？告诉你吧！这样的衣服是有故事的——那种衣料本身就是一种故事，如果有人在旅途中寂寞难耐，就很可能会想听她讲讲故事。”

她语速极快，连珠炮似的说了一通就闭上了嘴。从她纹丝不动的脸上，很难看出她刚才发表了一通议论。阿贝挺了挺身子，像是要站起来，却又坐下了。

“那天下午你带我去参加那个滑稽的舞会——就是圣吉纳维芙的那场舞会……”他开口说道。

“这我还记得。玩得很开心，是不是？”

“我并不觉得开心。就是这次见到你，我也不开心。我对你们俩感到厌烦了，不过与你们相比显不出什么，因为你们更是烦透我了。这情况你应该心知肚明。我要是还有精力的话，就去找新的朋友了。”

在她进行反驳时，他注意到她的丝绒手套上有一层蓬松的绒毛。

“跟人怄气实在是愚蠢之举，阿贝。你肯定说的不是心里话。我不明白你为什么要自暴自弃，像个泄了气的皮球。”

阿贝陷入了沉思，几次要咳嗽和擤鼻子都被他压了下来。

“这可能是因为无聊才导致的。现在想回过头重新开始，似乎要跨过千山万水。”

一个男子常常会在女人面前演戏，将自己扮作一个无助的孩子，可他一旦觉得自己的确像一个无助的孩子时，索性就假戏真做了。

“别再找借口了。”尼科尔干脆地说。

阿贝的情绪越来越坏，什么都不想说，只想说难听的话，说纯粹神经质的话。尼科尔无可奈何，只好呆坐在那里，双手放在膝上，两眼直视前方。一时间，二人谁都不说话，各想自己的心事，恨不得躲到一个有碧水蓝天的地方喘喘气，谁都别见谁。他们不像是情侣，因为他们没有浪漫史，也不像夫妻，因为他们不拥有未来。不过，在此之前，除过迪克，尼科尔最喜欢的人就是阿贝了——阿贝对她更是一往情深，心情沉重、担惊受怕地爱了她许多年。

“对于女人的圈子，我已经烦透了。”他突然说。

“那你就躲到一个只有你自己的圈子里好啦。”

“对于朋友圈，我也觉得厌烦了。全都是些见人说人话见鬼说鬼话的人！”

尼科尔恨不得能把车站的钟拨快些，耳边却听见阿贝在问：“你同意我说的话吗？”

“我是个女人，我的职责是弥合分歧，将拆散的东西聚合在一起。”

“我的职责是将聚合在一起的东西拆散。”

“你喝醉的时候似乎什么都拆散不了，只能拆散你自己。”此时的尼科尔心灰意冷，她感到有点害怕，对阿贝失去了信心。车站里人头攒动，到处是人，但她一个也不认识。过了一会儿，谢天谢地，她总算看见了一个熟人——那是一个高个子女孩，一头浅黄色头发就像戴着一顶头盔似的，正在把几封信塞进邮筒的投信口里。

“那儿有个人，我得过去说句话。阿贝。阿贝，别愣着！你这个傻瓜！”

阿贝不急不躁地目送她走了过去。那女孩转身看见尼科尔，显出一副惊讶的神情。阿贝认出了她，觉得自己在巴黎的哪个地方见过她。他趁尼科尔不在跟前，使劲咳了几声，并捂着手帕干呕，还大声地擤了几下鼻子。天气渐热，汗水湿透了他的内衣。他的手抖得厉害，点烟时一连擦了四根火柴才点着。看来，非得去酒吧喝一杯了。谁知就在这时，尼科尔却回来了。

“真没劲儿！”尼科尔淡淡地说，“她曾经求我去看望她，现在见了我却狗眼看人低，就好像我是什么烂货似的。”她说得激动，哈哈一笑，竖起两根手指做了个不屑的手势，“看来还是别自讨没趣。”

阿贝呛了一口烟，咳嗽了几声，待咳嗽停下来之后说道：“问题在于：不喝酒的时候，你不愿见任何人，而当你喝醉的时候，任何人都不愿见你。”

“你在说谁？我吗？”尼科尔又笑了一声——不知怎的，刚才的那场邂逅反而让她的心情有所好转。

“我说的是我自己。”

“那是你的情况，而我却不同——我喜欢交朋友，交很多很多的朋友……我喜欢……”

尼科尔没把话说完，就见罗斯玛丽和玛丽·诺思走了过来，步子很慢，边走边在寻找阿贝。尼科尔大呼小叫起来：“嘿！喂！嘿！”她高兴得哈哈大笑，把她为阿贝买的那包手帕举在手里挥动着。

阿贝身躯高大，这几个女子在他的跟前显得很不协调——面对着她们，他就像是一艘巨轮的残骸。他虽然有着自身的缺点，放纵、褊狭和尖刻，但对这几个女子却有着巨大的影响力。她们能感受到从他身上流露出一种高贵的气质，深知他是一个有作为的人——他曾在过去取得过鼓舞人心的成就，只是那些成就已成为历史，被别人所超越。不过，她们为他身上的意志所担心——以前，那是为了生存而奋斗的意志，现在则成了只求速死的意志。

迪克·戴弗来了，生气勃勃，容光焕发。三位女子见了，像孩子一样高兴得跳了起来，欢喜得大叫一声，冲了过去，又是搂他的肩膀，又是拍他那顶漂亮的帽子，要不然就摸摸他那手杖的金手柄。一时间，她们将高大、龌龊的阿贝抛在了脑后。迪克一眼就看清了自己的优越之处，不动声色运用着自身的魅力，将他们拉到了车站里面，在这里能看得见车站的种种奇观。近旁，有几个美国人在话别，说话的声音及语调就像水龙头里的水在流进一只巨大而陈旧的澡盆里。车站以巴黎为背景，你站在这里，犹如站在海洋的岸边——那海洋起伏翻腾，海水里的原子在巨变，在变成一个新的群体。

原来这是些富有的美国人。只见他们潮水般穿过候车厅，涌上月台，一张张面孔表情各异，有的聪颖，有的谨慎，有的愚蠢，有的则莫测高深。这人海中偶尔会闪过一张英国人的脸，那么冷峻和匆忙。月台上美国人一多，就给人一种印象，觉得他们单纯又有钱——这几乎成了遮蔽人眼目的民族特色，使得他们自己以及旁观者都会这么想。

突然，尼科尔抓住迪克的胳膊喊叫起来：“快看！”迪克应声转过头去，结果看见了在一瞬间发生的一幕场景。只见在两节车厢开外的卧铺车厢的入口处，在话别的人群里，赫然出现了一幕惨景——那个刚才同尼科尔说过话、有着头盔般发式的年轻女子，蓦地一闪身子，从正在与之谈话的一个男子那儿跑开几步，发疯似的从手袋里掏出一把手枪。啪、啪两声枪响回荡在狭窄的月台上。巧的是就在这时火车的汽笛长鸣一声，车身开始启动，淹没了那两声枪响。阿贝又在窗口挥了挥手，显然他并不知道刚才发生的事。但不等人群围上去，迪克他们却看见了枪击的后果——那个男子被击中，跌坐在了月台上。

过了好大一会儿，火车才停了下来。尼科尔、玛丽和罗斯玛丽等在外边，而迪克挤进了人群去看究竟。五分钟后，他跑过来跟她们会合。这时，围观的人群分成了两拨，一拨跟躺在担架上的受伤男子走，另一拨跟随在开枪的女子身后——女子脸色苍白，表情镇静，而押解她的两名警察却显得有点慌乱。

“那是玛丽亚·沃利斯，”迪克急促地说，“她枪击的那男子是个英国人，人们花了不少时间才弄清楚他的身份，因为他的身份证被子弹打烂了。”他们几个说着话，疾步离开火车那儿，跟着人群走了。“我要弄清她被带到哪个警察局，所以我要跟着去……”迪克说。

“她姐姐就住在巴黎，”尼科尔不愿叫迪克去，于是说道，“为什么不打电话给她？真怪，竟没有人想到这一点。她嫁了个法国人，毕竟比咱们管用。”

迪克犹豫不决，最后摇摇头，还是走掉了。

“等等！”尼科尔在他身后喊道，“这太傻了！就凭你的那点法语，能帮什么忙呀？”

“至少我能监督他们，不让他们暴力对待她。”

“她肯定会受到羁押的，”尼科尔语气坚定地说，“因为她毕竟开枪打了人。现在最好的办法就是赶快给劳拉打电话——她比咱们管用。”

迪克仍听不进去。再说，他是想在罗斯玛丽面前表现一番。

“你等着！”尼科尔不容分辩地说了一声，拔腿就向一个电话亭跑了过去。

“尼科尔一旦插手什么事，”迪克调侃地说，“那你就只好乖乖顺从了。”

他看了罗斯玛丽一眼——这天上午，他还是第一次将目光投向了罗斯玛丽。二人含情脉脉地交流了一下眼神，在心里重温了前一天的激情。刹那间，他们仿佛进入了梦境，耳旁似乎又响起了温情的爱的私语。

“你喜欢帮助他人，是不是？”罗斯玛丽说。

“那只不过是装装样子。”

“我母亲也喜欢帮助人——当然，她帮的人不可能有你帮的那么多。有时候，我觉得我是天下最自私的人。”她叹了口气说。

罗斯玛丽此时提到她母亲，让迪克有点气恼（这种现象还是第一次出现）——他拼命地想躲开她的母亲，想让他和罗斯玛丽的事不受干扰，可是罗斯玛丽动辄便将母亲搬出来，就像是个断不了奶的孩子。不过，他同时也意识到：自己感情冲动就等于失去了对局面的控制；万一他激情消退，哪怕只是一会儿，罗斯玛丽也会步步紧逼，真不知会产生什么样的后果。他不无惶恐地看到：此事表面上看风平浪静，其实不然，已经到了骑虎难下的地步。他也第一次意识到：罗斯玛丽掌握着主动权，比他处于更有利的位置。

还未等他想出个应对之策来，尼科尔就回来了。

“我找到劳拉了。她一听这消息就吓坏了，说话的声音都变了，时高时低的，仿佛慌了神，一会儿发晕，一会儿又振作起来。她说她有预感，知道今天上午要出事。”

“玛丽亚真应该参加佳吉列夫[72]的芭蕾舞团。”迪克想要让大家恢复平静，于是说了句俏皮话，“她的舞台设计感和节奏感是很强的，趁着火车启动而开枪，让人们只看见火车移动，却没有听见枪响。这样的场景咱们以后还能看得到吗？”

他们几个从宽宽的钢铁楼梯上走了下来。只听尼科尔说道：“我为那个可怜的男子感到难过。怪不得玛丽亚跟我说话时神情怪异，原来她是准备开枪伤人。”

说完，她大笑了起来，罗斯玛丽也跟着笑。其实，她俩都吓坏了，深切希望迪克能在道德层面上说个孰是孰非，别让她们来评判。这种愿望并非一时的胡思乱想，对罗斯玛丽来说更是如此——她对弹片擦着头皮呼啸而过这种镜头已习以为常，但现实还是叫她感到极度震惊。此刻，迪克也心乱如麻，脑子被刚才的一番思索搅得乱成了一锅粥，哪里还有心情进行道德说教。于是，几位女子怅然若失，心里蒙上了一层阴影，感到有些不快。

后来，戴弗夫妇和朋友们充满活力地走到了大街上，好像什么事也没有发生过似的。

但是，毕竟事情已经发生了。首先，阿贝走了，玛丽这天下午也要动身去萨尔茨堡[73]——这意味着他们在巴黎的日子结束了。或者说，也许是那两声枪响不知为什么在大家伙儿的心里产生了震荡，终止了他们在巴黎的日程。那枪声回荡在他们的心房，余音久久不散，陪伴着他们来到了人行道上。等出租车时，他们听见身边有两个搬运工在议论这次枪击事件。

“你看到那把左轮手枪了吗？小巧玲珑，镶着珍珠，像把玩具枪。”[74]一个搬运工说。

“小是小，但威力很大。你没有看到他的衬衫吗？上面满是血，真像是在战场上负了伤。”[75]另一个搬运工内行地说。





第二十章


他们在广场下了车，汽车排出大量废气，在七月的阳光下慢慢聚集着。这是一种可怕的东西——跟纯粹的热气不同，别指望到乡下避暑就可以躲得开，因为所有的道路都弥漫着这种难闻的气味。下车后，他们到卢森堡公园对面的露天餐馆吃午饭。罗斯玛丽感到腹部发痛，因此烦躁不安，一副没精打采的样子——在火车站时，她曾说自己自私，这恐怕就是一种自私的表现吧。

对于她的变化，迪克一无所知——他郁郁寡欢，光顾着想自己的心事，丧失了他一贯具有的敏锐的观察力（正是依赖这种观察力，他才能做出正确的判断），因而没有觉察到周围情况的变化。

一位意大利音乐教师过来跟他们一起喝咖啡，然后由这位教师送玛丽·诺思上火车。二人离开后，罗斯玛丽也站起身来，说她要到制片厂“见几位官员”。

“哦，还有——”她说道，“科利斯·克莱，就是那个南方小伙子，要是他来这里，而你们还没有走，那就麻烦你们转告他，就说我等不及了，让他明天给我打电话好啦。”

由于受到刚才那件事的惊吓，她忘记了礼节，说话时倒像是小孩子撒娇，结果勾起了戴弗夫妇对他们自己孩子的舐犊之情，不过却遭到了那位做妻子的一口回绝。只听尼科尔毫不掩饰地用冰冷的语气说道：“你最好让侍者转告吧，因为我们马上就走。”

罗斯玛丽碰了个钉子，心里却没有生气，说道：“那就随他去吧。再见，亲爱的。”

迪克要了账单。他们两口子放松下来，心不在焉地咬着牙签。

“嗯——”他们不约而同地说。

他见她嘴角掠过一丝不快，只是一闪而已，但他还是注意到了，却假装没看见。尼科尔在想些什么？罗斯玛丽是他过去几年里“研究”的十多个人中的一个。这些人包括一个法国马戏团小丑、阿贝和玛丽·诺思、两个舞蹈演员、一个作家、一个画家、一个大木偶剧场[76]的喜剧女演员、一个疯疯癫癫的俄国芭蕾舞团的同性恋演员，还有一个他们在米兰资助过一年的有前途的男高音歌手。尼科尔很清楚，迪克对这些人有着浓厚的兴趣，并投注了很大的激情，但她也知道：自从他们结婚以来，除了她生孩子的那些日子，迪克没有一夜离开过她。从另一方面讲，迪克自身有一种招人喜欢的气质——但凡具有这种气质的人，不管是有意还是无意，都会像磁石一样吸引人（他们并未着意要利用这些人）。

此刻，迪克表情僵硬，既无贴心的温存话语，也无他们俩在一起时经常流露出来的亲昵。

那个南方小伙子科利斯·克莱从摆得密密麻麻的桌子之间挤了过来，随随便便地跟他们打了个招呼。对于这样的打招呼方式，迪克每次都会感到愕然，因为只有熟人才会对他们两口子（或他们当中的一个）这么“嗨”的一声。他很在乎待人接物的礼节，遇到尴尬的场合宁肯不露面。如此大大咧咧地闯到他面前，就是对他做人原则的挑衅。

科利斯全然不知自己礼节欠佳，一来便神气十足地说：“可惜来晚了一步……那位大人物已经走了。”迪克心里怪他没有先向尼科尔致意，后来忍了忍，才算原谅了他。

不大一会儿，尼科尔起身离开了。迪克陪科利斯坐着，准备将杯子里的残酒喝完。按说，他还是喜欢科利斯的——科利斯属于“战后”的一代，与他十多年前在纽黑文认识的绝大多数南方人相比较还是容易结交的。科利斯一边慢条斯理地往烟斗里装烟叶，一边侃侃而谈，迪克则饶有兴趣地听他说话。此时中午刚过，几个孩子和保姆正走进卢森堡公园去玩耍。数月来，迪克这还是第一次如此悠闲地消磨时光。

后来，科利斯谈到罗斯玛丽，推心置腹地说了一席话，让他的血都凝固了。

只听科利斯说道：“你也许觉得罗斯玛丽冷淡，其实并非如此。我承认：有好长一段时间我都觉得她冷淡。可是，一次过复活节，我们乘火车一道从纽约前往芝加哥，途中她跟我的一个朋友遇到了麻烦（我的那个朋友是个小伙子，名叫希利斯——在纽黑文时她还说希利斯是个傻瓜呢）。她本来和我表姐在一个车厢，可是下午时分却想跟希利斯在她们的车厢里单独待一待。于是，我表姐就来到了我们的车厢，大家在一起打牌。过了大约两个小时吧，我陪表姐回她的车厢去，只见罗斯玛丽和比尔·希利斯站在过道同列车员争吵——罗斯玛丽脸色苍白。原来，他俩在车厢里锁上了门，还放下了窗帘。我猜想列车员来查票，敲响车厢门时，他俩正在里面干不尴不尬的事。起初，他们以为是我们在开玩笑，所以硬是不开门。后来开了门，列车员却不依不饶，责问希利斯这是否是他的车厢，他们把门锁上，是否说明他同罗斯玛丽已经结了婚。希利斯也发起火来，说他们的行为并无过错，还说列车员侮辱了罗斯玛丽，为此真想揍他一顿。这件事也可能怪列车员故意找碴吧……不瞒你说，我费了很大的劲儿才将此事平息了下来。”

听了那一对年轻人在火车过道里跟列车员不幸对峙的事，迪克思绪万千，把每一个细节都想到了，不由生出了一股醋意，觉得自己对罗斯玛丽的感情发生了变化。想一想他和罗斯玛丽的关系中出现了第三者的身影，哪怕是已经消逝的身影，也足以叫他心里失去平衡，感到五味杂陈，有痛苦、悲哀、肉欲，也有天昏地暗的绝望。他眼前仿佛闪过一幅幅生动的画面：希利斯在车厢里用手摸罗斯玛丽的脸，呼吸加快——里面有一个不容窥探的、神秘的、温馨的事件正在发生，从外边看上一眼也会叫人热血沸腾。

迪克胡思乱想着，耳畔似乎响起了那对年轻人的对话：

“我放下窗帘，你不介意吧？”

“放下来吧。这儿也太亮了。”

就在他遐想之际，科利斯·克莱话锋一转，谈论起了纽黑文的情况，还是刚才的那种语气，绘声绘色的。迪克推测他也爱着罗斯玛丽，只不过他的爱是奇特的爱，是迪克无法理解的爱。罗斯玛丽同希利斯的风流案似乎没有在感情上对科利斯造成伤害，反而叫他感到高兴，觉得罗斯玛丽毕竟还是“食人间烟火”的。

“博内斯聚集了一大帮名人，事实上我们也是。纽黑文是个花花大世界，可惜我们离开了。想起来就让人感到遗憾。”科利斯仍在滔滔不绝地说着。

迪克的耳畔似乎仍回响着那对年轻人的对话：

“我放下窗帘，你不介意吧？”

“放下来吧。这儿也太亮了。”

跟科利斯分手后，他横穿巴黎去了他的开户银行。填写支票时，他抬头望了一眼那些正在埋头办公的职员，心里在盘算把支票交给哪一个职员办理才好。他写字时，将精力集中在手头这件事上，仔细检查一下钢笔，接着趴在玻璃面的高高的桌子上写了起来。其间，他曾抬起呆滞的眼观察邮递柜台那儿的情况，但马上就又将注意力集中在了支票上。

他仍然拿不定主意，不知该把支票交给哪一位职员办理才好。对于他当前的窘境，他们当中有谁最不可能瞎猜，最不可能嚼舌头根呢？这边是佩林，一个精于世故的纽约人，此人曾在美国俱乐部请他吃过饭。那边是西班牙人卡萨苏斯，此人常同他谈论一个共同的朋友，实际上尽管这个朋友十多年前就跟他没有什么联系了。另外还有穆奇霍斯，此人总是问他想取他妻子存的钱还是他自己的钱。

他在支票票根上填了钱数，在下面画了两道杠，决定去皮尔斯那里办理手续——皮尔斯年轻，在他面前稍微遮掩一下即可。在年轻人面前，装装样子是比较容易的，不易被对方看出破绽。

他先走到了邮递柜台那儿。接待他的一个女职员见台子上有张单子眼看快要掉下去，便用胸部顶了顶，把它又顶了回去。他心想：女人利用自己的身体真是大大不同于男人呀！他从邮递柜台取了自己的信件，拿到一边拆开看了起来。一封信是一家德国书店寄来的，里面装着一张他订购十七本精神病学书籍的账单；一封信里装的是布伦塔诺[77]寄来的账单；一封是他父亲从布法罗[78]写来的信，那字迹一年比一年难以辨认了；还有一张汤米·巴尔班寄来的盖有菲斯[79]邮戳的明信片，并有一段诙谐的附言；有两封信是苏黎世医生寄来的，都是用德文写的；一份账单是戛纳的一位泥水匠寄来的，钱数存在着争议；一份账单来自于一个家具商；一封信来自巴尔的摩[80]的一份医学杂志的出版商，通知他有个年轻艺术家的画展，并邀请他光临；还有三封信是尼科尔的，另有一封信托他转给罗斯玛丽。

看见罗斯玛丽的信，他的耳畔仿佛又响起了那对年轻人的对话：

“我放下窗帘，你不介意吧？”

他到皮尔斯那里办理手续时，见他正在接待一位女顾客，转过身发现隔壁柜台的卡萨苏斯闲着，于是决定将支票交给卡萨苏斯办理。

“你好吗，迪克？”卡萨苏斯热情地打招呼道。他满面笑容地站起身来，八字胡向两边展开。“那天我们说起费瑟斯通时，我就想到了你——他现在在加利福尼亚。”

迪克瞪大了眼睛，向前倾了倾身子。

“在加利福尼亚？”

“我是听人说的。”

迪克递过支票。为了让卡萨苏斯把注意力集中到支票上，他就不再说话，而是将目光转向了皮尔斯的桌子，冲皮尔斯友好地挤了挤眼——皮尔斯知道这是在跟他开玩笑，指的是他三年前同一位立陶宛女伯爵的风流韵事。皮尔斯报之一笑。卡萨苏斯办理完支票事务，觉得没有理由再耽搁他自己喜欢的迪克，于是站起身，手里拿着他的夹鼻眼镜，把刚才的话又重复了一遍：“是的，他的确在加利福尼亚。”

这时，迪克朝着坐在最边上一张办公桌旁的佩林瞥了一眼，看见他正在和世界重量级拳击冠军说话。佩林用眼角的余光望了望他，显然在盘算，看是不是有必要把他叫过去介绍给那位冠军，但最后还是放弃了这一打算。

迪克无心再跟卡萨苏斯深谈，于是就将目光集中在了玻璃办公桌上——也就是说，他在紧紧盯着那张支票看。他检查了支票，盯着跟前大理石柱旁张贴的注意事项看了看，然后扫一眼卡萨苏斯脑袋右侧的某个地方，晃一晃手杖，碰一碰头上的帽子，将那些信件拿在手中，说了声再见便扬长而去了。他早就给过了门卫小费，而出租车已在路边等他。

“我要去卓越电影制片厂——它在帕西[81]的一条小街上。你把车开到米埃特。到了那儿我再指给你看。”

近四十八小时内发生的事件接二连三，弄得他六神无主，都不知道接下来该做什么好了。到了米埃特，他付了车钱，打发了出租车，然后朝电影厂那个方向走去。快到厂子跟前的时候，他穿过马路到了街对面。他衣着考究，身上的配饰也很高档，然而心里一片茫然，就像一只走投无路的丧家犬。只有推翻了过去，推翻过去六年来的努力，才能获得尊严。他绕着这段街区转圈，瞎碰乱撞，步子迈得很快，生怕罗斯玛丽走出电影厂时与他失之交臂，傻头傻脑的就像塔金顿[82]笔下情窦初开的少年。这一带弥漫着凄凉的气息。电影厂隔壁是一家服装店，看得见那儿贴着一张宣传帖子，上书：“一千件衬衫供您挑选！数数吧，足有一千件！”橱窗里尽是衬衫，胡乱堆放着，有的配着领带，有的套在模特架子上，有的十分不雅地扔在橱窗里的地上。电影厂的另一侧可以看见许多招牌，其中有“纸张店”“糕点铺”“处理商品”“廉价商品”（还有一张康斯坦斯·塔尔梅奇[83]主演的《日出早餐》的海报）。再往远处，则可以看见一些更为凄惨的广告，什么“教士服装”“讣告”及“承办殡葬事宜”什么的，全都跟死亡有关。

他清楚自己目前的所作所为将会使自己的人生发生重大的转折，与以前所有的事情都不同，甚至不同于自己心里的希冀（他希望能对罗斯玛丽产生良好的影响）。罗斯玛丽历来都将他视为中规中矩的学习榜样。可现在他掉了魂似的四处乱窜，未免有失体面。不过，他如此茫然，却是内心状况的一种反映。只见他这儿走走，那儿站站，衬衣的袖口紧包住手腕，外衣的袖口则像套阀一样套在衬衫的袖口上，衣领适中地裹在脖子上，红红的头发修剪得整整齐齐，手里拎着小巧的公文包，俨然一个花花公子——又像是一个迷惘的人，站在费拉拉[84]的教堂前万念俱灰，觉得有必要向上帝忏悔。此时的迪克心里千头万绪，想到的恐怕有难以忘怀的往事、尚未忏悔的隐私，还有剪不断理还乱的情愫。





第二十一章


他在那儿逗留了三刻钟之后，突然碰到了一个人。事情就是这样，就在他情绪不佳、不愿见人的时候，偏偏就有人过来了。有的时候，他千小心万小心，不愿暴露自己的内心世界，可结果还是使这种意图归于失败——这就像一个演员，想淡化自己的角色，结果适得其反，反而会引起观众浓厚的兴趣，抻长脖子要看个究竟（观众似乎有一种能力，善于窥探他到底要隐瞒什么）。同样，对于那些需要乞求我们同情的人，我们则很少同情，却将同情心留给那些以别的方式打动我们、值得同情的人。

对于以下的遭遇，迪克恐怕就是这么分析的。当他在圣天使街来回踱步时，有个瘦脸的美国人走过来跟他搭话。那人约莫三十岁，像是心灵受过什么创伤，脸上挂着一丝诡异的微笑。他向迪克借火，迪克给了他。迪克把他归于自己在少年时就熟悉的那类人——这种人喜欢在烟草店鬼混，一只胳膊肘支在柜台上，天知道抱着什么样的心思打量着进进出出的人们；这种人是汽车修理厂的常客，鬼鬼祟祟不知在那里干什么勾当；这种人还经常出没于理发店、戏院门厅这类地方。反正，迪克认定他就是这种人。有时，这样的面孔会出现在泰德[85]那充满了暴力的卡通画上——孩童时代，迪克在卡通画上看到这样的面孔，总觉得它象征着某种阴暗的罪恶，常常会感到不安。

“你喜欢巴黎吗，伙计？”

不等迪克回答，这位男子就跟了上来，紧接着又追问了一句：“你从哪儿来？”

“布法罗。”

“我来自圣安东尼[86]，战后一直住在这里。”

“服过兵役吗？”

“服过。在第八十四师……你听说过那支部队吗？”

这人趋前几步，然后回过头望着迪克，目光有点凶狠。

“准备在巴黎待一阵子，或仅仅是路过，伙计？”

“路过。”

“你住在哪家旅馆？”

迪克不禁暗暗发笑，心想：“难道你还想夜里到我的房间偷东西不成？”不知怎的，他的心思竟然被对方看了出来。只听这家伙说道：“以你这样的身体，不应该害怕我，伙计。这一带倒是有许多混混，专门袭击美国游客，但你不用怕我。”

迪克觉得他很讨厌，于是停下来说：“真不知你怎么有这么多的时间闲逛。”

“我在巴黎做生意。”

“什么生意？”

“卖报。”

此人一副凶神恶煞的模样，却干卖报这样的营生，其中的反差令人觉得好笑。紧接着，他又补充了一句：“别担心，去年我赚了不少钱——每份售价六法郎的《太阳时报》，我卖到了十到二十法郎。”

他从一个褪了色的皮夹子里取出一份剪报，递给似乎已成了他散步同伴的迪克——那是一幅漫画，画上有大批美国游客从满载着黄金的轮船通过踏板拥上岸。

“一个夏天就来了二十万人，花掉了一千万。”

“你跑到帕西来干什么？”

这家伙小心翼翼地四下看了看，鬼鬼祟祟地说：“拍电影。这里有一个美国的片场，需要会说英语的人。我在等待机会。”

后来，迪克总算坚决、果断地将他甩掉了。

很明显，就在他绕着街区转圈圈的时候，罗斯玛丽走掉了，要不然就是他来这儿之前就走了，反正他没有遇上她。他走进街角的一家酒馆，换了枚铅币，然后挤进位于厨房和臭烘烘的厕所之间的一个小亭子里，给乔治王旅馆拨了个电话。他觉得自己的呼吸有点像“潮式呼吸”[87]——不过，这只是他内心情绪的一种反映而已。他把乔治王旅馆的电话号码告诉了接线员，然后就手拿话筒站在那儿等待，眼睛望着酒吧间里的情况。过了很长时间，话筒里才传来了一个低低的声音，听上去有些陌生。

“我是迪克。恕我冒昧打电话给你。”

罗斯玛丽沉吟片刻，然后振作起来，用跟他的感情相吻合的语气说：“我很高兴你打电话来。”

“我来电影厂找你了……我现在就在帕西，在电影厂的对面呢。我原想和你一起乘车去森林公园里兜兜风。”

“哦，我在电影厂只待了一会儿就走了。”罗斯玛丽说完就住了声。

“罗斯玛丽！”

“你说，迪克。”

“不瞒你说，我现在无时无刻不在想你。要是一个女孩子搅得一个中年男子心神不宁，情况可就复杂了。”

“你不是中年人，迪克。你是世界上最年轻的人！”

“罗斯玛丽？”他说完就不作声了，眼睛盯着一个酒架，上边摆着一些劣质的法国酒，其中有金像奥达酒、圣詹姆斯朗姆酒、玛丽·布里沙酒、橘味潘趣酒、费纳·布朗卡酒、罗歇樱桃酒及阿玛纳克烧酒。

“你一个人吗？”

迪克问话时，耳畔仿佛又响起了那对年轻人的对话：“我放下窗帘，你不介意吧？”

“你认为我会跟谁在一起呢？”

“我现在也是一个人，真希望能和你在一起。”

罗斯玛丽沉吟了一下，叹了口气，然后说道：“你现在在我身边就好了。”

此刻的她正躺在旅馆的房间里，身边放着一部电话，周围回荡着袅袅的音乐：

两个人喝茶，

我陪伴着你，

你陪伴着我，

只有你和我。

迪克心猿意马，仿佛能闻到她那被太阳晒得发黑的身上所扑的香粉味——他吻她的面颊，看见她的鬓角汗津津的，还看得见她那白净的脸和浑圆的肩膀。

“这是不可能的。”他喃喃自语道。一转眼，他便来到了大街上，大踏步向米埃特走去（或者说在离开米埃特），一手依然拎着他的小公文包，一手紧握金柄手杖，就像握着一把宝剑。

而罗斯玛丽则回到写字台前，继续给母亲写信：“……我匆匆只看了他一眼，但我觉得他英俊极了，让我一见钟情（当然，我最爱的还是迪克，但你知道我心里的感受）。其实，这部片子即将由他执导，而且他马上就要到好莱坞去，我想咱们也应该去。科利斯·克莱也在巴黎。我倒是很喜欢他，但因为戴弗夫妇的缘故，不常跟他见面——戴弗夫妇简直太好了，是我见过的最好的人。我今天觉得不大舒服，虽然不一定非得吃药，但我还是吃了。此处我就不多说了，详情见面时细谈。见此信后，请速发电报来！千万！千万！你是愿意到北方来，还是让我和戴弗夫妇一道去南方看你？”

下午六点钟，迪克给尼科尔打了个电话。

“你有什么特别的安排吗？”他问，“想不想干点修身养性的事——在旅馆共进晚餐，然后一起去看戏？”

“你愿意这样？我随你，怎么都行。刚才我给罗斯玛丽打电话，她在自己的房间里吃饭。那件事情弄得大家的心情都不好了，你说呢？”尼科尔说。

“对我没什么影响。”迪克反驳说，“亲爱的，除非你累了，否则咱们就出去高兴高兴。不然，等咱们到了南方，一个星期都得在想，当时怎么没去看布歇[88]的画展。这点比苦思冥想强……”

他不注意说漏了嘴，而尼科尔不等他说完就不客气地问：“苦思冥想什么？”

“就是想玛丽亚·沃利斯开枪打人的那件事呗。”

末了，尼科尔同意去看戏。他们之间形成了一个惯例——绝不应该过于劳累，以至于影响生活的品质。于是，他们在白天快快活活，晚间则有条不紊。有的时候，他们不可避免地会觉得精神不济，这时他们就归咎于别人——由于别人的缘故，他们才疲倦不堪。出门时，这对夫妻精神抖擞、风姿绰约（如此漂亮的佳偶在巴黎比较少见）。他们先敲了敲罗斯玛丽房间的门，没有反应，估计她睡觉了，于是二人就相携步入温馨的、熙熙攘攘的巴黎之夜，走到富凯酒吧，在幽暗的灯光下喝了杯掺了苦酒原汁的味美思酒[89]。





第二十二章


尼科尔很晚才醒来，嘟哝了几句又进入了梦乡，最后才分开在睡眠中粘在一起的长长的睫毛。迪克的床空着——她很快明白过来，她是被客厅的敲门声惊醒的。

“请进！”她叫道，但门口没有动静。过了一会儿，她手忙脚乱披上一件晨衣过去开门。来者是个警察，跟她礼貌地打了个招呼便走进了客房。

“阿夫汗·诺思先生呢？他住在这儿吗？”

“什么？不在这里——他去美国了。”

“他什么时候走的，夫人？”

“昨天上午。”

警察摇摇头，朝她飞快地晃了晃食指。

“昨天夜里他还在巴黎。他在这家旅馆开了房间，但他的房间里没人。他们告诉我最好到这儿来问问。”

“这就怪了——昨天上午我们已把他送上了那班赶轮船的火车。”

“也许是那样吧，但今天早晨旅馆的人还看见他在这儿，甚至连他的身份证都看了。情况就是这样。”

“这我们可一点都不知道。”尼科尔满脸惊愕地说。

警察沉吟了片刻（此人相貌堂堂，只是身上有一股难闻的味）。

“你们昨天夜间没有和他在一起？”

“没有。”

“我们抓了一个黑人，而且我们坚信最终落入法网的就是那个作案的黑人。”

“我一头雾水，不知道你在说什么。如果你指的是我们的熟人亚伯拉罕·诺思先生，说他昨夜在巴黎，那我们就一无所知了。”

警察点点头，舔了舔上嘴唇，相信了尼科尔的话，但有些失望。

“出了什么事？”尼科尔问。

警察一摊手，努了努紧闭的嘴。这时他发现尼科尔长得很漂亮，便多看了她两眼。

“你想会出什么事，夫人？还不就是夏季常发的案件。阿夫汗·诺思先生遭到了抢劫，报了案。我们逮住了作案人。阿夫汗先生需要去辨认一下，并提出指控。”

尼科尔把身上的晨衣裹紧一些，很快就将警察打发走了。带着满腹的疑惑，她洗了澡，穿好了衣服。此时已过了十点钟。她给罗斯玛丽打电话，但没人接，随后又给旅馆的服务台打电话，这才知道阿贝确实开了房间，时间是今天早晨六点半，但他的房间到现在仍空着。她到套房的客厅里等迪克，希望能听听他的解释，可是久久不见迪克回来。正当她感到失望，决定出门时，旅馆的服务台打来电话，告诉她说：

“克劳肖先生求见——他是个黑人。”

“有什么事？”她问。

“他说他认识你和戴弗医生，说有个叫弗里曼的先生被关进了监狱——弗里曼先生是全世界人的朋友。他说这是件冤案，希望能在自己被捕之前见见诺思先生。”

“我们什么也不知道。”尼科尔猛地放下话筒，不再搭理这摊子事。阿贝·诺思这么古怪地再度冒出来叫她有点厌倦，觉得阿贝的放纵行为令人无法容忍。她决定不再去想他，便出门去了裁缝铺，谁知在那儿碰见了罗斯玛丽。随后，二人相伴去里沃利大街购物。她买了人造花和几串彩珠，又帮罗斯玛丽为她母亲挑了一颗钻石，还选了几条围巾和一些新颖别致的烟盒，让罗斯玛丽回国后送给加利福尼亚的同事。接下来，她为儿子买了许多希腊和罗马玩具兵，足够组成一支军队，花了她一千多法郎。她们花钱的方式再次显出了不同——尼科尔出手阔绰，再次叫罗斯玛丽羡慕不已。尼科尔泰然自若，觉得在花自己的钱，而罗斯玛丽不知怎的，总奇怪地觉得自己花的钱是借来的，必须精打细算。

沐浴着异国他乡的灿烂阳光，大把地花钱乃人生一大乐事。只见她们晃动着健康的身躯，脸上荡漾着明媚的光彩，满怀自信地伸出胳膊和双手，摆动双腿和脚踝，昂首阔步，深信她们的姿态在男人们的眼里十分可爱。

她们回到旅馆，发现这天上午的迪克容光焕发，面目一新，她们不由感到心情愉悦，一时间高兴得像孩子一样。

迪克刚接到阿贝打来的一个电话——阿贝说话吞吞吐吐，似乎在躲什么人。

“这是我有生以来接过的最怪异的电话。”他说道。

在阿贝的电话里，说话的不仅是他本人，还有十几个其他的人。那些人七嘴八舌地说什么：“有个人遇到了麻烦，这是他本人这么说的，想咨询一下你。怎么样？……喂，那是谁在说话？能不能闭上嘴！……实不相瞒，他卷进了一件丑闻，恐怕回不了家了。我个人认为……我个人认为他可能是……”话筒里传来喘息的声音，接下来又说了些什么，就听不清了。

电话的那头还有人建议说：“我觉得你是心理学家，可能会对一件事感兴趣。”接下来，那个不明身份的当事人便滔滔不绝说了起来，可是不管迪克是心理学家还是别的什么家，对他的事并无兴趣。

迪克同阿贝的通话是这样的：

“喂！”

“你好吗？”

“还好。喂！”

“你是谁？”

“我吗？”话筒里传来嘻嘻嘻一阵笑声。

“好的，我让别人来听电话。”

有时，迪克能听见话筒外有阿贝的声音，伴随着推推搡搡和掼话筒的声音，还能听到远处零零星星的说话声，诸如“不，我不能，诺思先生……”什么的。后来，话筒里有一个鲁莽的声音果断地说道：“如果你是诺思先生的朋友，那你就赶快来把他叫走吧。”

就在这时，阿贝插进来，语气庄重而生硬，以一种毅然决然的腔调压倒了其他一切声音，说道：“迪克，我在蒙马特尔[90]发动了一场种族暴动，准备去把弗里曼救出监狱。如果有个哥本哈根来的黑人刷鞋匠去找你……喂，你能听见我说话吗？喂，如果有人去找你……”接下来，话筒里又响起了乱糟糟、七嘴八舌的声音。

“你为什么要回巴黎？”迪克问。

“我已经到了埃夫勒[91]，然后决定坐飞机返回，这样就可以将它和圣苏尔皮斯[92]做个比较。我并不是要将圣苏尔皮斯带回巴黎。我甚至不是说巴洛克[93]！我是指圣日耳曼[94]。看在上帝的分上，稍等一会儿，我去叫侍者来听电话。”

“看在上帝的分上，别去叫！”

“听着……玛丽走了吗？”

“走了。”

“迪克，今天上午我遇到了一个人，我想让你跟他谈谈。他父亲是个海军军官，在欧洲认识很多医生。我先跟你说说他的情况吧……”

迪克没等他说完就挂了电话。这样做也许不义气，但他心里乱成了一锅粥，需要清静清静。

“阿贝以前是个挺不错的人，”尼科尔对罗斯玛丽说，“可以说相当不错。真是往事如烟啊！那个时候我和迪克刚结婚。你要是在那时认识他就好了。他常来我们家，一住就是几个星期，静悄悄的，几乎就觉察不到他在屋子里。有时他会……有时他会在藏书室里弹哑巴钢琴，陶醉于其中……迪克，你还记得那个女仆吗？她觉得阿贝就像个鬼魂，有时在门厅里碰见她，会冲她嗷嗷怪叫，一次吓得她把一套茶具都摔碎了……不过，我们并不在意。”

多么有意思啊！真是妙趣横生的往事！罗斯玛丽羡慕他们，觉得那是一种闲云野鹤般的悠闲生活，跟她忙碌的日子截然不同。她不知道悠闲是什么滋味，像从未过上悠闲生活的人那样，她对悠闲抱有敬重的态度。她觉得那是一种修身养性的安逸生活，却全然不知戴弗夫妇像她一样一点也不安逸。

“他怎么会变成这样了呢？”她问道，“他为什么非得喝酒呢？”

尼科尔摇了摇头，似乎在表明自己与阿贝的堕落无关。只听她说道：“如今，有许多原本很有头脑的人都走了下坡路。”

“哪个时候不是如此？”迪克说，“有头脑的人一贯规行矩步，有些受不了约束，就走了下坡路，破罐子破摔。”

“一定还有更深层次的原因。”尼科尔固执地说——她为迪克竟然当着罗斯玛丽的面反驳自己而生气，“以艺术家为例吧……哦，费尔南德就不太可能嗜酒如命。为什么只有美国人才沉湎于酒色呢？”

这个问题有太多的答案，迪克决定不予点评，就让尼科尔自鸣得意好啦。近来，他特别爱挑尼科尔的毛病。虽然他认为尼科尔是自己见过的最有魅力的女人，虽然尼科尔满足了他所有的需要，但他隐约觉得他们俩之间的冲突已不可避免，于是不知不觉便强硬起来，时时刻刻在加强防御。他不是个放浪形骸的人，觉得自己和罗斯玛丽的私情有伤大雅，此时盲目地希望尼科尔不要多想，只将他对罗斯玛丽的感情视为热情。他心里有点忐忑……昨晚看戏时，尼科尔说罗斯玛丽还是个孩子，似乎话外有音。

他们三人在楼下吃了饭。餐厅里铺着地毯，侍者的脚步轻轻的，不像前不久他们吃饭遇见的那些侍者，把美味佳肴端上餐桌时，脚步又快又重。此时，餐厅里有几家美国人，你看看我，我看看你，似乎想彼此搭话。

旁边的餐桌好像在举办宴会，搞不清到底是什么宴会，其中有一个秘书模样的年轻男子，豁达健谈、彬彬有礼，总是提出“你不介意重复下刚才的话吧”这样的请求，另外还有二十几个妇女。那些妇女已不年轻，但也不算老，看不出属于社会的哪个阶层。她们像是一个团体，彼此关系很亲密，而非因为丈夫的业务关系聚在一起的女人。当然，她们是团体，却又不像是旅游团体。

迪克原想说句尖刻的打趣的话，却又本能地把溜到嘴边的话咽了回去，问侍者她们是些什么人。

“她们是阵亡将士的母亲。”侍者解释说。

他们听了，唏嘘感叹了一番。罗斯玛丽热泪盈眶。

“那些年轻女子也许是阵亡者的妻子。”尼科尔说。

迪克端着酒杯，又朝那群人望了一眼，看到的是一张张幸福的面容和弥漫于四周的庄严气氛，顿然感到历经风雨的美国已经成熟。那些哭泣的女人是来悼念自己死而不能复生的亲人的，神情是那般肃穆，一时间给餐厅增加了美感。迪克浮想联翩，仿佛又回到了童年时代——他坐在父亲的膝上；他和莫斯比一道骑马。美国传统的忠诚和献身精神在他的心头荡漾。几乎是费了很大的劲儿，他才回到现实中，将注意力转向身边的两个女子，重新面对这个他看得见的全新世界。

他的耳畔似乎又回响起了那对年轻人的对话：

“我放下窗帘，你不介意吧？”





第二十三章


阿贝·诺思上午九点钟来到丽兹酒吧避难，此时他仍在这里。他来的时候，窗户开着，强烈的光线照进来，只见肮脏的地毯和坐垫上荡起的灰尘在阳光下飞舞。侍者从走廊经过，缥缈如魂魄，游荡于空旷的店内。正对面有一个女士酒吧间，看上去非常小，想象不来到了下午怎能容纳那么多人。

大名鼎鼎的酒吧老板保罗还没有来。正在清点货物的克劳德放下手里的活，对阿贝的到来并没有感到特别意外，而是给他倒了杯酒提神。阿贝在靠墙放的一条长凳上落座，两杯酒下肚后感到精神好了些。由于精神得到了提振，他便跑到理发店修了面，返回酒吧时，保罗已经来了。保罗是乘坐特别定制的汽车来的，在嘉布遣大道下了车，远远望见自己喜欢的阿贝便迎了过来和阿贝说话。

“我原定今天上午坐船回家的，”阿贝说，“我是说昨天上午回家。算啦，就不管是哪天上午吧。”

“那你为什么不走呢？”保罗问。

阿贝想了想，最后找到了一个理由说：“我正在读《自由报》上的一篇连载，下面一个部分就要在巴黎发表，如果我坐船走了，就读不到了……也许一辈子也读不到了。”

“这肯定是一个非常精彩的故事。”

“其实是一个很糟糕的故事。”

保罗嘿嘿一笑，停了停，将身子倚在一张椅子的椅背上，然后说道：“要是你真想走的话，诺思先生，明天你的两个朋友是要乘坐‘法兰西’号走的——一位先生叫斯利姆·皮尔逊。还有一位先生叫什么名字来着……让我想想……是个高个子，新蓄的胡子。”

“亚德利。”阿贝说。

“是亚德利先生。他们两个要坐‘法兰西’号走。”

保罗说完就要走开去办事，可是阿贝留住他说：“如果我不走瑟堡[95]那条航线，而行李从那边托运，那该如何是好？”

“那就到纽约领行李好啦。”保罗一边离去一边说道。

这条建议很合理，很合乎阿贝的心意，让他感到心情舒畅——这证明有人在关心他，或者说他不必为此而操心劳神。

这时，又有顾客陆续走进了酒吧。首先进来的是个大块头的丹麦人，阿贝曾在哪儿见过他。丹麦人在对面的一张椅子上坐下，阿贝猜想他可能会在那儿一坐就是一整天，喝酒、吃饭、聊天或看报什么的。阿贝心里涌起一股英雄豪情，想跟他比比看谁坐的时间长。十一点钟，大学生们拎着书包开始出现了，一个个都小心翼翼地走路，生怕他们的书包纠缠在一起。也就是在这个时候，阿贝让侍者接通了戴弗夫妇的电话，觉得只要跟戴弗夫妇联系上，也就跟其他的朋友有了联系。他原想分头给朋友们打电话的，后来又觉得那样有点分散精力。他心神不定，老想着一件事——那就是应该挺身而出，把弗里曼从监狱里救出来。不过，具体采取哪些步骤他却不愿多想，就像不愿多想噩梦一样。

下午一点钟，酒吧里已挤满了人，人声嘈杂，侍者们穿梭忙碌着，为顾客送饮品和结账。

“来两杯斯丁格鸡尾酒……再来一杯……三杯马蒂尼酒……没有你的了，夸特勒先生……你喝了三杯了。共是七十五法郎，夸特勒先生。谢弗先生说他喝过这种酒……你这是最后一杯了……我只能按你说的去做……多谢多谢。”

混乱之中，阿贝没有位子坐，只好站在那儿，微微晃着身子，跟几个自己认识的人闲聊。一条狗跑过去，牵狗的皮带绕在了他的腿上，他将腿抽出来，不惊也不怒，而狗的主人则连声道歉。有人邀请他共进午餐，他谢绝了，他说他马上要去布利格里斯，到布利格里斯有点事情要办。过了一小会儿，他向一个熟人辞别，模样就像酒徒硬充风雅，似囚徒或家仆一般。他回头望了一眼，发现酒吧里喧闹的场面已经不见了——真是来得快，去得也快。

阿贝回到自己的桌子跟前，发现对面的丹麦人以及他的同伴都已经点了饭菜。阿贝也给自己点了一份，但几乎动也没动，只是坐在那儿，愉快地回忆着往事。美酒可以使人乐而忘忧，让过去变为现在，再把现在变为将来——仿佛过去美好的时光将来还会再现。

四点钟的时候，侍者走过来问他：“一个名叫朱尔斯·彼得森的黑人找你，你愿意见吗？”

“天哪！他怎么找到我的？”

“我可没跟他说你在这儿。”

“那是谁说的？”阿贝一激动，碰翻了酒杯，但随即又镇定了下来。

“他说他已经到所有美国人常去的酒吧和旅馆找过了。”

“跟他说我不在这儿……”侍者刚要转身离去，阿贝又问了一句：“他会不会找到这里来？”

“让我去看看吧。”

保罗碰巧在跟前，听见阿贝末了的一句问话，回过头望了一眼，看见是阿贝，摇摇头，走了过来。

“很抱歉，我不能让他找到我。”

阿贝吃力地站起身来，出门到康邦街去了。





第二十四章


理查德·戴弗拎着他的皮革公文包，离开了第七区的警察局。他在警察局给玛丽亚·沃利斯留了一张便条，署名是“迪科尔”（这是他和尼科尔初恋时写情书用的名字）。他到裁缝店那儿去了一趟。店员们对他殷勤备至，其热情程度跟他所付的钱有点不相称。也许他举止高雅、气宇轩昂，才让这些可怜的英国店员觉得他是个大主顾吧，想起来真叫他感到不好意思。另外，他还额外地让裁缝把丝绸衬衣的袖子改动了一英寸，这也令他觉得难为情。接下来，他去了克里雍大饭店，在饭店的酒吧间里喝了一小杯咖啡和两小盅杜松子酒。

当他走进饭店的大厅时，觉得这里格外亮堂。出了大厅，他才知道原来是外边的天色已经暗下来的缘故。这是一个紫茉莉飘香的夜晚，但风很大，香榭丽舍大街上风声萧瑟，树叶飘零。他走上利沃利大街，沿着带有拱顶的廊道过了两个街区，到了他开户的那家银行取他的邮件。离开银行时，天空噼噼啪啪落下了大雨，他叫了一辆出租车，在雨雾中驶上香榭丽舍大街——他独自一人坐在车里，心里想着他的爱情。

他想到了自己下午两点时在乔治王旅馆的走廊里和两个绝色女子在一起的情景，不禁心猿意马——尼科尔美如达·芬奇所画的蒙娜丽莎，而罗斯玛丽则像一幅插图画里的天仙。汽车里行驶在雨雾中，他坐在车里像着了魔一样狂乱，只觉得像很多其他男人那样，情欲在心里翻腾，似脱缰的野马一般，他明白事情并不简单。

罗斯玛丽怀着复杂的情绪打开了房间的门——那种情绪是别人无法了解的。此刻的她就像是人们常说的“狂乱的小精灵”。在这两天里，她魂不守舍，心里一片茫然，不知如何是好，觉得自己的生活就像是拼图游戏——她得权衡利益、计算得失，得将迪克、尼科尔、她母亲以及她昨天认识的那个导演放在一起做通盘考虑（这些人就像是珍珠项链上的一枚枚珍珠，都很珍贵）。

迪克敲门时，她刚穿戴整齐，正在观看窗外的雨景，心里想到了一首诗以及比弗利山庄[96]那积满了雨水的水沟。开了门，她觉得迪克仍像平时一样，俨然就是天神——年轻人就是这样，总是以一成不变的眼光看待自己的长者。迪克看见她，却感到一种难以抑制的失望，没有立刻对她那毫不掩饰的甜蜜微笑以及她那亭亭玉立、如含苞待放的鲜花般的躯体做出反应。他注意到通向浴室的地毯上有一行她留下的湿湿的脚印。

“你好，电视小姐！”他故作轻松地打趣道。他把他的手套、公文包放在梳妆台上，手杖靠在墙边。他的下巴努力控制着嘴角愁苦的皱纹，就像控制不便外露的恐惧，硬将那些皱纹逼到了额头和眼角。

“过来，坐在我的腿上，”他温柔地说，“让我看看你可爱的小嘴。”

她走过来，坐在了他的腿上。此时，窗外的雨渐渐慢下来了，听得到滴答滴答的声音。她把芳唇凑向自己心目中勾勒的那个英俊、冰冷的天神。

紧接着，她在迪克的嘴上吻了几下。她凑向他时，他觉得她面如满月、肤如凝脂，美得让人感到目眩。有时候，美能使人产生最高尚的思想，于是他想起了自己对尼科尔应负的责任，想起尼科尔就在走廊对面隔着两个门的房间里。

“雨停了，”他说，“你看见屋瓦上的阳光了吧？”

罗斯玛丽站起身来，弯下腰，以极其坦率的语气说：“啊，你和我都是善于逢场作戏的演员。”

说完，她走到梳妆台前，刚把梳子插进头发，就听到一阵慢慢的敲门声。

他们惊得呆若木鸡。敲门声又响了几下。罗斯玛丽想起门没有锁上，便三下两下将头发梳整齐，冲迪克点了点头。迪克飞快地把他们坐皱了的床单抚平，一边去开门一边以不高不低、极为自然的声音说道：“如果你不愿出去，那我就给尼科尔说一声，咱们今晚就安安静静待在这里得了。”

这番小心是没有必要的，因为门外那些人正为自己的处境烦恼，根本无心关注与自己无关的事情。只见阿贝站在那里，一天没见便老了许多。另外还有一个惶恐不安的黑人，阿贝介绍说他是斯德哥尔摩来的彼得森先生。

“他的处境很糟糕，都应该怪我，”阿贝说，“我们需要有人给指点指点。”

“到我们的房间去。”迪克说。

阿贝非要让罗斯玛丽也跟着去。于是，他们几个穿过过道去了迪克的套房。朱尔斯·彼得森个子小小的，是个值得尊敬的黑人，属于美国边界的几个州里追随共和党的那类温文尔雅的黑人。

彼得森似乎是今天清晨发生在蒙帕尔纳斯[97]的那个事件的合法证人。他已陪同阿贝去过警察局，证明阿贝所说的他被一个黑人抢去了一千法郎钞票的情况属实，而黑人抢劫犯的身份成了此案的一个焦点。阿贝和朱尔斯·彼得森由一位警员陪同，返回出事的那家酒吧，过于仓促地将一个黑人认作了罪犯，一小时后才弄清这个黑人是阿贝离开后才去那里的。警察又拘捕了另一位颇有名气的黑人——饭店老板弗里曼，而弗里曼只是喝了点酒，晕晕乎乎在早一些时候到现场去过，后来就走了。这一来，案子就变得更加扑朔迷离了。阿贝的朋友报案时所说的那个真正的罪犯其实只抢走了阿贝用来付酒账的一张五十法郎的钞票，此人不久前还担着一身恶名到现场去过呢。

简而言之，阿贝在短短的一个小时里就与居住在法国拉丁区[98]的一个欧洲黑人及三个美国黑人搅和在了一起，他觉得跟这几个人在生活和思想感情方面产生了剪不清理还乱的联系，根本无望从这种旋涡里脱身。这一天在这样一种氛围中过去了，不时会有陌生的黑人面孔不知从哪个地缝里冒出来，出现在一个意想不到的角落里，而且不时会有黑人打电话来。

而实际上阿贝本人把他们全都甩掉了，身边只剩下了朱尔斯·彼得森。彼得森的境况窘迫，他就像是一个曾经帮助过白人的印第安人——那些受冤枉的黑人与其说是要找阿贝算账，倒不如说是要找他算账。所以，他便将阿贝当成了保护伞，寻求阿贝的庇护。

彼得森曾在斯德哥尔摩生产鞋油，是个小老板，但由于经营失败，现在手里只剩下了鞋油配方和一小箱子刷鞋用的工具。不过，他的这位新保护人先前曾许诺，说要帮助他在凡尔赛做生意（阿贝以前的司机现在是那儿一家鞋厂的老板），而且借给了他两百法郎。

罗斯玛丽听了他们杂乱无章的叙述，觉得味如嚼蜡——只有兴致比较高、幽默感比较强的人才喜欢听这种稀奇古怪的遭遇。这个随身携带着鞋油配方的矮个子男人，以及他那双贼不溜秋、惶恐不安地骨碌碌乱转的眼睛，还有阿贝那清秀但憔悴的面容——所有这些就像疾病一样离她十分遥远。

“我只求能有一次东山再起的机会。”彼得森的英语发音也还准确，但带着一种殖民地国家的人所特有的怪腔怪调，“我的生产工艺简单，配方优良，因为我不愿意卖配方，就被赶出了斯德哥尔摩，结果破了产。”

迪克很有礼貌地听他说话，开始还蛮有兴趣，后来不知怎的兴趣就消失了。只见他转过身对阿贝说：“你去找家旅馆睡一觉，恢复了精神，彼得森会去看你的。”

“你不想听听彼得森遇到的困难？”阿贝不情愿地说。

“我去过道里等着，”彼得森识趣地说，“也许当着我的面不便谈论我的事。”

他不伦不类地模仿法国人那样鞠了一躬，随后便退出去了。阿贝也站起了身，慢吞吞的，像是一台正在启动的机车。

他说道：“看来今天我不太受欢迎哟。”

“欢迎不欢迎暂且不论，”迪克说，“建议你离开这个旅馆……如果愿意，就从酒吧那儿走。你可以到尚博尔旅馆休息，假如需要更多服务，那你就去宏大旅馆。”

“能麻烦你给我倒一杯酒吗？”

“我这里没有酒。”迪克撒谎说。

阿贝无奈，跟罗斯玛丽握了握手，同时脸上的表情慢慢恢复了平静。他拉住罗斯玛丽的手久久不放，嘴里断断续续地嗫嚅着：“你可是最……你是最最……”

罗斯玛丽为他感到难过，心里讨厌他的那双脏手，脸上却挤出一个十分得体的笑容——这就像看到一个在梦境中游走的人，她觉得并没有什么可奇怪的。有时，人们会对一个醉汉表现出一种奇特的敬重，有点像脑子简单的人敬重疯子。敬重而非畏惧。一个人一旦无所顾忌，变得天不怕地不怕，可能会激起别人的敬畏之心。当然，这样的人虽然一时威风凛凛，有一种不可一世的气概，事后却会因此付出代价。这时，阿贝转向迪克，提出了最后一个请求：“如果我去找一家旅馆，痛痛快快洗个澡，把头发梳理整齐，睡一会儿觉，再把那些塞内加尔人[99]打发掉……晚上能不能让我来这里的炉火旁跟你们聊天？”

迪克对他点点头，三分同意七分嘲讽，然后说道：“你现在自视甚高，以为自己本事很大哟。”

“我敢说，要是尼科尔在这儿，她一定会让我回到这儿的。”

“好吧。”迪克走到行李箱托盘跟前，拿过一只盒子放到中间的一张桌子上，盒子里有许多字母卡片。

“要是你愿意玩一玩字谜游戏，那你就可以来。”

阿贝厌恶地看了看盒子里的东西，就好像迪克要他把那些玩意儿当作燕麦吃下去似的。

“什么字谜游戏？你觉得我遇到的怪事还不多吗……”

“这是一种不费劲的游戏。你可以用这些字母卡片拼单词——除了‘酒’这个词，别的词都能拼出来。”

“我敢肯定，‘酒’这个词也能拼出来。”阿贝把手插进卡片堆里说，“如果我能拼出这个词，就可以回来吗？”

“要是你愿意玩字谜游戏，你就可以来。”

阿贝无奈地摇了摇头。

“你如果这样想的话，那就没办法了，我只会碍手碍脚的。”他带着责备意味朝迪克晃了晃手指说，“但请记住乔治三世[100]的话：格兰特要是喝醉了，会恨不得咬其他的将军几口。”

末了，他用发黄的眼角那儿射出的余光绝望地瞥了罗斯玛丽最后一眼，便走出了房间。他见彼得森已不在过道里了，顿然觉得如释重负。接下来，他感到一片茫然，有一种无家可归之感，于是就去找保罗，向保罗打听那艘航船叫什么名字。





第二十五章


等阿贝踉跄地走出房间，迪克和罗斯玛丽立刻就拥抱在了一起。虽然二人身上都沾着巴黎的尘埃，但他们透过尘埃嗅着对方身上的气味——迪克的钢笔套有一股橡皮的味道，而罗斯玛丽的脖子和肩膀散发出淡淡的、暖丝丝的馨香。迪克意犹未尽，沉迷于其中，而片刻之后罗斯玛丽首先回到了现实。

“我得走了，小伙子。”她说道。

他们身子在渐渐分开，眼睛却含情脉脉地望着对方。罗斯玛丽在很小的时候就学会了这种退场的姿势，在片场上导演从未对此挑出过什么毛病。

她回到自己的房间，打开房门，径直走到桌子跟前，因为她突然想起她的手表忘在了那里。她拿起表戴在手腕上，低头看了看每天给母亲必写的那封信，同时脑子里想好了最后的一个句子。就在这时，她没有转过身就觉察到房间里还另有他人。

在住人的房间里，一些反光的物件一般不太引人注意，如油漆过的木制家具、擦得锃亮的铜器、银器和象牙制品什么的。此外，还有许多能传递光与影的东西，由于传递的效果不明显，往往被人们忽视，如画框的顶边、铅笔和烟灰缸的边棱、水晶体或瓷器的饰面什么的——这类东西虽然对我们的视觉影响甚微，但同时也在影响着我们的潜意识，使我们产生一些支离破碎的联想，犹如玻璃匠把形状各异的玻璃集中在一起，以备日后所需。罗斯玛丽事后故弄玄虚地称之为“觉察”的现象可能就属于这种情况——她当时并不能断定屋子里另有他人，但她“觉察”到了这一点。说时迟那时快，只见她来了个一百八十度的大旋转，动作就像是在跳芭蕾舞，然后就发现一具黑人尸体横在她的床上。

她“哎呀”一声惊叫起来，还未扣好表带的手表砰地磕在了桌子上。她一时产生了一个荒谬的念头，觉得死者是阿贝·诺思。随后，她冲出门，向过道对面跑去。

迪克正在清理东西，检查了一下当天戴过的一副手套，顺手将其扔到了箱角的一堆脏手套里。他把外套和背心挂起来，然后把衬衫抖平挂在另一只衣架上（这是他的一个习惯）。他常说：“衬衫脏一点，照样可以穿，但皱了就不能穿了。”尼科尔进来，正要把阿贝的一只别致的烟灰缸扔进废纸篓里，就在这时，罗斯玛丽冲进了房间。

“迪克！迪克！你快来看！”

迪克三步并作两步穿过过道到了她的房间，跪下身子听听彼得森的心脏，摸摸他的脉搏——尸体还有些温热，那张生前饱经磨难、不够诚实的脸，死后显得很丑陋，充满了痛苦；那个盛着擦鞋工具的盒子压在他的一条胳膊下，而吊在床边的那只鞋没有擦鞋油（鞋底已经磨穿）。根据法国的法律，迪克无权触动尸体，但他抬起死者的胳膊看了一眼——绿色床罩上有一处血迹，下面的毛毯肯定也会有血迹的。

迪克关上门，站在那儿考虑起来。这时，他听见过道里传来轻轻的脚步声，接着听见尼科尔在叫他的名字。他打开门，小声地说：“去把咱们床上的床罩和盖毯拿来——不要让别人看见你。”他见她脸上表情紧张，于是急忙补充了一句：“听我说，你不必害怕——这只不过是黑人的一次斗殴事件。”

“希望这事能快点了结。”尼科尔说。

迪克托起尸体，发觉它很轻，显然是因为死者生前缺乏营养所致。他保持着这种姿势，好让死者伤口冒出的血流到死者的衣服上。随后，他把尸体放到床的旁边，揭下床罩和盖毯，走到房门跟前把门打开一条缝，细听外边的动静。只听见过道的那头碟子相碰哐当地响了一声，接着听见服务员傲慢地大声说：“谢谢，夫人！”——不过，服务员朝另一个方向，也就是工作人员专用楼梯那儿走去了。迪克赶紧跑过过道，同尼科尔交换了床罩和盖毯，将它们铺到罗斯玛丽的床上。然后，他站在温暖的暮光里分析案情，脸上淌着汗珠。在检查过尸体之后，他觉得有些情况是可想而知的。首先，对阿贝怀有敌意的那个黑人跟踪到了这里，看见了这个对阿贝友好的黑人，后者情急之中躲到了罗斯玛丽的房间里，那家伙追了进来，杀死了他；其次，如果听任事态自然发展，那么，世界上没有任何力量能使罗斯玛丽免遭名誉损害——阿巴克尔[101]一案的污点至今几乎都没有消除。罗斯玛丽的合同是否有效，完全取决于她能否严格地、一丝不苟地保持《父女情深》里的那种清纯形象。

虽然穿的是一件无袖汗衫，但迪克习惯性地做了一个挽袖子的动作，弯下腰，一把抓住死者外套的肩部，用脚后跟踢开门，飞快地把尸体拖到过道里，放在一个合适的位置。随后，他回到罗斯玛丽的房间，将长毛绒地毯抚平，使其恢复原貌。接着，他回到自己的套房，给旅馆经理挂了个电话。

“麦克贝斯吗？我是迪克医生……有件事很要紧。咱们是否用专线私下谈谈？”

可喜的是，他曾经做过一番努力，同麦克贝斯先生建立了牢固的关系。他广交朋友，人脉很广，原以为是用不上的，但这次却派上了用场……

“今天一出门，我们发现了一具黑人死尸……是在过道里……不，不，他是个平民。等一等……我知道你不想让别的客人见到这具尸体，所以我打电话给你。当然，请你务必不要提我的姓名。我可不愿因为发现了这具尸体，就同法国官僚打交道。”

他处处为旅馆考虑，真是用心良苦！就在两天前的晚上，麦克贝斯曾亲眼看见了他身上这样的品质，所以对他说的话深信不疑。

不一会儿，麦克贝斯先生到了，又过了一会儿，来了一个警官。麦克贝斯觑了个空，悄声对迪克说：“你尽可以放心，任何一个客人的姓名都不会提到的。对于你的关心，我感激不尽。”

麦克贝斯先生随即意味深长地打了个手势，别人不明白是什么意思，然而却对那位警官产生了影响。只见那位警官露出一副激动和贪婪的神情，把胡子摸来摸去的。他敷衍了事地做了笔录，给局里打了个电话。与此同时，人们手脚麻利地把尸体抬到了这家世界上最豪华旅馆之一的另一套房间里，效率之高是朱尔斯·彼得森这个商人完全能够理解的。

迪克回到自己的房间去了。

“这是怎么回事？”罗斯玛丽叫道，“难道美国人一到了巴黎就要相互残杀吗？”

“现在似乎是一个凶杀案多发期。”迪克说，“尼科尔在哪儿？”

“我想她在浴室里。”

她敬重他，因为他把她从泥潭中解救了出来。她曾经有一个预感，觉得此事可能会产生灾难性后果，而现在总算风平浪静了。刚才，她听着他用一种坚定、果断、礼貌的声音三言两语就把问题解决了，心里简直对他崇拜得五体投地。可是，没等她来得及用一颗心和身体去亲近他，他的注意力便转向了别处。他进了卧室，向浴室走去。这时，从浴室的锁眼和门缝里传来一阵撕心裂肺的叫喊声，声调越来越高，传遍了整个套房，让人听了毛骨悚然，连隔得老远的罗斯玛丽也听见了。

她以为尼科尔在浴室里滑倒，跌伤了，于是便随在迪克的身后跟了过去，但她看到的是另一番情景。迪克用肩膀碰碰她，要她回去，而且不由分说挡住了她的视线。

尼科尔跪在浴缸旁边，身体不停地摇来晃去。“都怪你！”她叫道，“我在世界上只有这一点净土，也让你给破坏了。竟然让这儿染上了血污！那我就披上这带血的床罩叫你看看！我感到遗憾，但不感到丢人。上次在苏黎世湖上过愚人节，那里都是傻瓜，我就想披床罩亮相呢，可他们就是不允许……”

“控制一下你的情绪！”

“……我坐在浴室，他们拿来一个面罩命我戴上，我只好乖乖地戴上。我能怎么样呢？”

“控制一下你的情绪，尼科尔！”

“我从不指望你爱我……说什么也太晚了……只是请你别到浴室来，只有在这里我才能清净一些。你别把那带血的床罩塞给我，让我处理！”

“控制一下你的情绪！请你站起来……”

罗斯玛丽回到客厅，听到浴室的门砰的一声关上了，吓得她站在那儿浑身发抖。现在她明白维奥莉特·米基思科在黛安娜别墅的浴室里看到的是什么了。这时，电话铃响了，她拿起话筒，听出是科利斯，顿时感到如释重负，高兴得差点喊叫起来。原来，科利斯要找她，才把电话打到了戴弗夫妇的套房里。她一边拿起帽子，一边告诉科利斯，让他上楼来，因为她害怕一个人回自己的房间。

第二篇


第一章


一九一七年春天，理查德·戴弗医生初到苏黎世时二十六岁，正是男人的大好年华，更是单身汉的黄金时代。即使正值战争年代，这也是迪克的好时光——他已成为一个宝贵人才，受到大力培养，是当不了炮灰的。而几年后，他觉得即使偏安一隅，日子也并非逍遥自在（不过，对于这一点，他心中并无定论）。在一九一七年，他还嘲笑过这种想法，歉疚地说战争连他的一根头发丝都没有碰到。家乡的医学董事会给他的指示是：完成在苏黎世的学业，按原定计划拿到学位。

瑞士就像一座孤岛，一边受意大利戈里齐亚一带狂涛怒浪的冲刷，另一边则有法国索姆河和埃纳河[1]的激流咆哮而过。有一段时间，出现在瑞士各州的身份不明的外国人似乎多于前来疗养的病人。在伯尔尼和日内瓦的小咖啡馆里处处可见窃窃私语的外国人，他们的身份难以猜测——可能是珠宝商人，也可能是旅行推销员。不过，盲人啦，独腿人啦，奄奄待毙的可怜人啦，在康斯坦茨湖以及纽沙特尔湖那明媚的湖畔也是处处可以遇见的。咖啡馆以及商店的橱窗里贴着鲜艳的宣传画，画的是一九一四年瑞士人保卫边疆的情景（同仇敌忾的青年和老人在山头怒视着山下假想的敌人——法国人和德国人），目的是要振奋民心，让瑞士国民不要忘记过去的光荣岁月。随着大屠杀的持续进行，这些宣传画渐渐失去了感召力。当美国也卷入战争时，没有哪个国家比同为共和国的瑞士更感到吃惊了。

此时，戴弗医生处于战争的边缘，闻到了硝烟味。一九一四年，他获得罗兹奖学金[2]，从美国的康涅狄格州到牛津大学学习，最后一个学年回国在约翰·霍普金斯大学继续学习，并获得了学位。一九一六年，他急急忙忙赶到了维也纳，如果不早点儿去，他觉得弗洛伊德大师说不定哪一天就会死于空袭。即使在那个时候，维也纳也弥漫着死亡的气息。不过，迪克想办法搞到了足够的取暖的煤炭和点灯用的煤油，躲在修女街的出租屋里写论文（这些论文曾被他付之一炬后，又重新写出来，成为他一九二○年在苏黎世出版的那本专著的奠基石）。

在我们的一生中，恐怕人人都有自己得意和风光的时期，而那些日子就是迪克·戴弗的得意期。首先，他有着迷人的魅力（只是他不知道罢了），时常给人以关爱，也能激起别人对他的爱戴，这在普通男女中是不多见的。在纽黑文的最后一年，有人称他是“福星迪克”——这称号他始终难以忘怀。

“好一个‘福星迪克’，你这个大傻瓜！”他常常在出租屋里绕着即将熄灭的炉火踱步，一边暗暗对自己这样说，“你只不过是瞎猫逮住个死老鼠，碰上好运气罢了，伙计。别人没碰上，而你碰上了！”

到了一九一七年初，就比较难搞到煤炭了。于是，他就把积存下来的差不多一百册教材都当柴火烧了。每当将一册书投入火中，他都会自信地一笑，觉得自己已经掌握了书里的内容，哪怕再过上五年，要他简单复述，他也能复述得了。这种非常的情况就出现在那个非常的时期。如果冷得受不了，他就把一块地毯披在身上御寒，心中却感受到学者的那种恬然自得（心情如接近天堂那样宁静）。不过，如下所述，这样的日子势必会终结的。

多亏他在纽黑文练过吊环，身体很棒，才能在那种环境里坚持学习，而且还能在多瑙河里冬泳。他和大使馆二等秘书埃尔金斯合住一套公寓，有两个可爱的女孩常来往（仅此二人，别人不常来，大使馆的人也不常来）。在与埃德·埃尔金斯的交往中，他开始对自己的智力是否上乘有了几丝怀疑，觉得埃尔金斯的智力跟他没有多大的差别——埃尔金斯能报得出纽黑文橄榄球队三十年中所有四分卫球员的名字。

“‘福星迪克’不可能属于这类聪明人，绝对不是什么完人，甚至还稍有欠缺。假如命运不是如此安排，而是叫他疾病缠身，或者心灵破碎，抑或自卑感严重，那就另当别论了（不过，如果有了缺陷，修复后也许比原样更好呢）。”

他暗自嘲笑自己的这一推论，称之为“似是而非的瞎说”，是“美国式”推论——只要是非理智性的言论，他就将其归于“美国式”。不过他也清楚，他虽然完好无损，但付出的代价却是“不完美”。

“我对你最大的希望，我的孩子，”在萨克雷[3]的作品《玫瑰和戒指》中，仙女布莱克斯迪克如此说，“就是让你的命运有一些波折。”

有时他对自己的推论感到颇为得意。在一个选举日，他心想：“大伙儿四处找皮特·利文斯顿，谁知他却坐在更衣室里不出来，这能怪我吗？我认识的人太少，是不可能击败伊莱休的，但我却胜出了。他出类拔萃，是个合适的人选，也许我应该坐在更衣室里不出来才对。如果我想到自己有机会当选，也许会那么做的。可是，默瑟那几个星期老来宿舍找我，我应该知道自己是有机会当选的呀！自己酿下的苦果自己吃！谁叫我自找麻烦，使自己陷于纠结的境地！”

上大学时，课后他常跟一位年轻的罗马尼亚学者探讨这个问题。那人安慰他说：“没有证据表明歌德曾有过这种现代意味的‘纠结’，荣格[4]那样的人也未曾有过。你不是浪漫的哲学家，而是一个科学家。记忆、逻辑力量、性格——尤其是良知，这些都会成为你判断自我的障碍。我曾经认识一个人，他花了两年时间研究犰狳的大脑，自以为他所获得的有关犰狳大脑的知识终究会超过任何人。我不停地同他争论，说他并未真正地了解人类知识的广度，认为他的看法过于武断。果不其然，当他将研究论文投给一家医学杂志时，遭到了拒绝，原因是他们刚刚接受了另外一个人写的论文，也是同样的课题。”

迪克去苏黎世时，身上的阿喀琉斯之踵[5]虽说没有蜈蚣的腿那么多，但数量也是可观的——例如，他错以为一个人可以永远精力充沛、身体健康，以为人心都是善良的。对于国家，他也有错误的认识，就像生活在边疆的母亲低声吟唱代代相传的谎言（她们硬说木屋门外没有狼）。获得学位后，他奉命参加了一支在奥布河畔的巴尔城[6]组建的精神病医疗队。

到了法国，他大为扫兴——他干的是行政工作，而非治病救人。作为补偿，他寻找时间写完了他那本简明教材，并为他的下一部著作收集了材料。一九一九年春，医疗队解散，他回到了苏黎世。

上面的文字有点像在写人物传记，只不过没有写明此处的主人公一如当年的格兰特——格兰特曾在加莱纳的一家杂货店里消磨时光，随时准备听从召唤，迎接扑朔迷离的命运。如果你看到过一个熟人的照片（他刚刚步入成年，青春洋溢），后来见他简直变成了一个陌生人（热情似火、体魄健壮、目光炯炯），你一定会感到困惑和吃惊的。这就是迪克·戴弗的写照——真正的他现在粉墨登场了！





第二章


那是四月的一个天气潮湿的日子，阿尔比松上空有几块雨云，长长的，斜挂在空中，而低洼处积着雨水。苏黎世同美国的城市没什么不同。自从两天前抵达这里以来，迪克一直感到怅然若失，此时才发现自己有这种感觉不是因为别的，而是因为这儿没有法国的那种偏街小巷。在苏黎世，真是景外有景——站在房顶远眺，你可以看到铃铛叮当响的奶牛牧场，那牧场一望无际，一直延伸到远处的山巅（这种田园牧歌式的美景印在明信片上，无异于天堂）。这儿有阿尔卑斯山地、儿童玩具、高山缆车、旋转木马和精密钟表，仿佛置身于仙境——在法国，葡萄蔓漫山遍野，你也会有这种感觉。

有一回他去萨尔茨堡，觉得那儿音乐绕梁，耳畔仿佛回荡着来自十九世纪的乐声。而一走进苏黎世大学的实验室，他就觉得自己的大脑变得思维缜密，仿佛成了一个善于做玩具的能工巧匠，不再是两年前那个在霍普金斯大学古老的红楼里横冲直撞，面对大厅内巨大的基督像投来的嘲讽目光不作停留的野小子了。

然而，他决定在苏黎世再待两年——制造玩具需要细之又细的精确度和不骄不躁的耐心嘛，对这两点他不敢掉以轻心。

这一天，他出门去看望位于苏黎世湖区多姆勒诊所的弗朗茨·格雷戈罗维斯。弗朗茨是这家诊所的坐诊病理学家，瑞士沃州人，比迪克年长几岁。他来到电车站迎候迪克。但见他皮肤黝黑，英气逼人，样子有点像卡格里奥斯特罗[7]，一双眼睛却似天使般纯洁。他是第三代格雷戈罗维斯，祖父曾是克雷佩林[8]的导师（那时，精神病学刚刚出现，犹如黑暗中出现了一缕曙光）。弗朗茨其人有点自命不凡，脾气火暴，对人却温文尔雅——他觉得自己俨然一个催眠师。如果家族的遗传基因稍微再弱一些，他无疑会成为一个出色的临床医师。

在去诊所的路上，只听他说：“给我讲讲你在战争中的经历吧。你是不是跟其他人一样，也有所变化？你也有一张傻傻的美国脸，一点也不显老。不过，我很清楚你其实并不傻，迪克。”

“我没有什么战争经历……从我的信中，你大概也能看得出来吧？”

“有没有战争经历其实无所谓……我们有些病人是仅仅从远处听了空袭的爆炸声就患上了弹震症，还有些只不过在报纸上看了看有关报道便患了精神病。”

“听上去简直是无稽之谈。”

“也许是吧，迪克。不过，我们诊所专门收治富人，不用‘无稽之谈’这样的词。坦率地说吧，你是来看我呢，还是来看那个女孩的？”

二人侧过脸相互对视。弗朗茨意味深长地笑了笑，然后用他那标准的男低音说道：“前几封信我自然都是拆开看过的，后来瞧出情况有了微妙的变化，也就不再拆那些信了。其实，后来都由你处理了。”

“那她病好了吗？”迪克问道。

“完全好了。我负责她的治疗。实际上，英国和美国的病人大多数都是由我负责治疗的。他们叫我格雷戈里医生。”

“关于那个女孩的情况，请允许我做一解释。”迪克说，“事实上，我只见过她一面。当时，我要到法国去，临行前来和你告别。那是我第一次穿军装，一路上总有当兵的向我行军礼以及诸如此类的事情，怪不自在的，弄得我觉得自己是个冒牌货。”

“今天你为什么没穿军装？”

“嗬！三个星期前我就退役了。我见到那女孩纯粹是巧合。我离开你之后，就朝你们在湖边的那座房子走去，去取我的自行车。”

“是去‘雪松楼’？”

“……那是个美妙的夜晚，山上明月高悬……”

“那是科伦扎格山。”

“前边有个护士和一个年轻女孩，我就赶了上去。我没有想到那女孩是个病人，一边跟她们一起走，一边向护士打听电车的时间。那个女孩太漂亮了，从没见过那么漂亮的女孩。”

“她现在仍然很漂亮哟。”

“她却是从来没有见过美国军装。我们就聊了起来。我当时也没有别的心思。”说到这里，迪克看到一处眼熟的景色不由停顿了一下，随后又接着说了下去，“弗朗茨，你见的病人多，已经不敏感了。我还没到你这种程度，我只要看见一只漂亮的贝壳，就会禁不住为那漂亮外表下的生命而惋惜。当时的情况就是这样……后来，那些信就接二连三地寄了来。”

“这对她而言是天大的好事，”弗朗茨戏谑道，“偶然相遇，一见钟情！所以，我不管再忙也要前来接你。我想让你去我的办公室，在见她之前你我先好好谈一谈。实不相瞒，我打发她到苏黎世办事去了。”他的声音因兴奋而有些发紧，“实际上，我没有让护士陪她，而是叫一个病人跟她一起去了，那个病人的病情还不太稳定。对于治疗效果，我颇为自豪——这是我取得的成就，当然偶尔也得到了你的鼎力相助。”

说话间，他们的车便沿着苏黎世湖岸行驶到了一个风景如画的地方，这儿有肥沃的牧场、连绵起伏的丘陵和一幢幢尖顶农舍。太阳钻出云层，高悬在如大海般蔚蓝的天空中。倏然，汽车驶进了瑞士的一个千姿百态的山谷，听得到百鸟啁啾，闻得到馥郁花香，看得见绿草如茵——一派生机勃勃的景象。

多姆勒教授的诊所位于一座小山丘和湖畔之间，共有三幢老式楼房和两幢新楼。该诊所创办于十年前，是第一家治疗精神方面疾病的现代医疗机构，其中的两幢楼房带有围墙（围墙不太高，上面爬满了藤蔓）——乍一看，外行看不出这儿是世界上心灵破碎者、心智不全者和精神变态者的避难所。有几个男子在太阳下耙草。他们的汽车驶进诊所的大院时，只见路上有个护士陪伴着病人，护士朝他们挥了挥手里的一面白旗。

弗朗茨将迪克引进他的办公室后，有事出去了半个小时。迪克一个人在房间里踱来踱去，看一看弗朗茨桌子上的杂物，再看一看屋里的那些书（其中有弗朗茨的专著，也有他父亲和祖父的专著，亦有他父亲和祖父的传记），又看一看弗朗茨的父亲（一个虔诚的瑞士人）那挂在墙上的深红色巨幅照片，试图从这些细节判断弗朗茨是怎样的一个人。房间里有烟味，于是他推开了一扇落地长窗，让一束阳光射进来。就在这时，他的思绪如脱缰的野马，想到了那个女孩。

在八个月的时间里，他收到那女孩写给他的信，大约有五十封之多。在第一封信里，女孩对自己的冒昧表示了歉意，解释说她曾听说美国女孩给素不相识的士兵写信是常有的事；她从格雷戈里医生那儿打听到了他的姓名和地址，如果有时写信向他问好，希望他别介意，等等。

信的风格很容易就能认得出是受到了《长腿叔叔》[9]以及《莫莉的憧憬》[10]的影响——这两部书信集轻松活泼，却又多愁善感，走红了美国各地。不过，女孩的信仅仅是在风格上有所相似而已。

那些信可以分为两类：第一类信大约写于停战协议签订的那个时期，有一种病态的迹象；第二类信的书写日期是从那个时候一直到现今，内容完全正常，表现出一种不断丰富成熟的个性。迪克在奥布河畔的巴尔城那郁闷的最后几个月里急切盼望看到的正是这第二类信。即便从最初的那几封信，他也已了解了女孩的心思，掌握的情况超过了弗朗茨对此事的猜度……

我的上尉：

看见你一身戎装，我觉得你帅极了。当时我心想，原来我是不喜欢法国人和德国人哟。你可能也觉得我漂亮，不过这种话我听多了，老早就麻木了。如果你再来这里，可别低三下四的一副猥琐相，那样完全不像我自小就熟知的绅士风度——上天会保佑你的。不过，你看上去好像挺文静的，比别的男人文静，温顺得就像一只大猫。我喜欢带点羞涩气的男孩子。你是不是这种人？你好像是的。

……

恕我冒昧，这是我给你写的第三封信了，马上就去邮寄，或者永远也不会发出。对于花前月下的浪漫我想了许多。只要我能离开这里，我就可以找到许多证人。

……

他们说你是个医生。不过，只要你像猫一样温顺，就是一个与众不同的医生。我头痛欲裂，就不能像正常人一样跟一只大白猫一起散步了——我的意思你大概是能理解的。我能说三种语言，加上英语就是四种了。如果你在法国需要翻译，我保证能够胜任。我坚信自己的能力，坚信我可以把一切都安排得妥妥当当，叫所有的人都规规矩矩的。今天是星期六，而你远在他方，也许已饮弹身亡了吧。

……

希望你哪一天能来到我的身旁——我将永远留在这葱绿的小山上，除非他们允许我写信给我深爱的父亲，让他把我接走。对不起，我今天身体有点不舒服，等好些了再给你继续写吧。

再见！

请原谅我就此搁笔。

尼科尔·沃伦

……

戴弗上尉：

我很清楚，内省法[11]对我这样高度神经质的人而言并非良策。我想让你了解一下我的境况。去年或者别的什么时候，我是在芝加哥变成这样的，简直跟仆人说不成话，也不能上街去，茫然不知所措，等待着有人前来为我指点迷津。总应该有高人担负起这个责任！应该有人为盲者引路！可是，无人前来揭开谜底——他们对我说话只说半截，而我浑浑噩噩，连二加二等于几都不知道了。有一个人很不错——他是个法国军官，能理解我，送给我一枝花，说“鲜花娇小，花语难解”。我们成了朋友。后来，他把花拿走了，使得我病情加重。再无人前来为我指点迷津。他们会常常对我唱一支有关圣女贞德的歌，结果弄巧成拙，只会叫我伤心落泪（那时，我的头还没有疼痛的感觉）。他们还滔滔不绝地讲什么要加强体育锻炼，但这种话我是听不进去的。那天，我跑到密歇根林荫大道，走了好远好远。最后，他们乘汽车追了来，可我硬是不肯上车。末了，他们将我拖上了车，而车上坐着几个护士。那以后，我就开始明白是怎么回事了，因为我能体会到其他病人内心的感受。我的境况就是这样。我来这儿不愿听那些乌七八糟的事情，而医生们偏偏老把那些事情挂在嘴边。你说这对我有什么好处？于是，我今天给家父写信，要他把我接走。很高兴你醉心于为人检查身体，迎来送往的。这其中一定有很大的乐趣！

以下是另一封信的几段文字：

希望你能放下手头的工作，给我写封信。他们刚刚给我送来几张唱片，让我别忘了自己的功课，我却把唱片全都一毁了之，惹得护士都不愿跟我说话了。那些唱片是英文的，所以护士们听不懂。芝加哥的一个医生说我是在胡闹，他真正的意思是怪我脾气火暴——他说他从未见过我这么任性的人。当时我满肚子的怨气，根本不理会他在说什么。我就是这种人，一生气就不管三七二十一，即便叫我粉身碎骨我也不在乎。

你那天晚上告诉我，说你要教我做游戏。哦，这恐怕是一种爱的表达，或者说应该是爱的表达。不管怎么说吧，反正我是很高兴你能醉心于诊治病人，为此而忙碌的。

你真挚的

尼科尔·沃伦

另有一些信，看得出写信人心境更加灰暗，似乎处于绝望之中。

亲爱的戴弗上尉：

我给你写信，因为我没有其他人可以求助了。这里的情况十分荒唐可笑，我这么一个病人尚且能看得出，你一定也心知肚明。我的精神疾病很是严重，也完全崩溃了，真是感到无地自容。难道这就是他们想要达到的目的？我的家人无耻地将我置之不管，求他们帮助我和可怜我纯粹是白费口舌。我已经忍无可忍，因为这样的日子只会毁掉我的健康，浪费我的生命——若说我脑子里的病可以治愈，简直是痴人说梦。

我犹如置身于一家疯人院里——这里的人装聋作哑，谁都不愿将实情告诉我。如果当初我明白了一切，如我现在这般，我是能够挺住的——我想我是十分坚强的。他们本应该坦率直言，可他们硬是要藏藏掖掖。

现在我总算明白了，不知为此付出了多少代价，而他们只是轻轻松松地袖手旁观，说什么应该一如既往地相信医生，尤其精神病患者更应如此。不过，现在我什么都看透了。

远离亲友，跟他们隔着一个大西洋，我一直很孤单，茫然地四处乱转。如果你能给我找一个翻译的差事（我懂法语和德语，就跟母语一样，意大利语也很棒，还会一点西班牙语），或者在红十字会救护队或训练队里谋个护士的职位（虽然我还得接受培训），你就是我的救星了。

还有：既然你不愿接受我的解释之词，那你至少可以敞开心扉，谈一谈你的看法嘛——你有一张像猫一样的和善的面孔，跟这儿随处可见的面孔均不相同，不是那么怪异。格雷戈里医生给了我一张你的小照，不如你身着戎装那样英俊，但看上去要年轻一些。

……





我的上尉：

能够收到你的明信片真是太好了。你对取消那些护士的资格一事很感兴趣，这叫我非常高兴。哦，你在明信片上写的话我心领神会，十分清楚。第一次见你，我就觉得你与众不同。

……

亲爱的上尉：

我今天想一件事，明天想另一件事，这就是我的真实情况——在遐想的时候，我心里有一种疯狂的反抗情绪，有点不知进退。不管你推荐任何一个精神病医生，我都会热烈欢迎。这儿，他们躺在浴盆里唱什么《在你自家的后院玩吧》，哪里知道我既无后院可以玩耍，也无任何希望（左看右看都看不到希望之光）。后来他们在糖果店又唱这首歌，我差点用秤砣砸那个人，亏得他们拉住了我。

近期我就不再给你写信了，因为我的情绪很不稳定。

接下来的一个月，迪克果真没有收到她的来信。一个月后，她的信又突然来了。

——我慢慢地又死而复生了……

——今天看得见鲜花绽放、白云飘荡……

——战争结束了（我几乎就不知道发生了战争）……

——你的心肠真是太好了！你肯定非常聪明，虽然你的脸像一只白猫（不过在格雷戈里医生给我的照片上你看上去并不像猫）……

——今天我去了苏黎世（又见到了一座城市，那种感觉是多么奇妙）……

——今天我们去了伯尔尼，那儿的钟表是多么的精致啊……

——今天我们去爬山，满山遍野寻找阿福花和火绒草……

这以后信就少了，但他有信必回。她有一封信是这样写的：

我希望有人爱我——我生病之前，许多小伙子向我表达过爱慕之情。不过，恐怕还得等上几年，我才能考虑谈情说爱这类事情。

只要迪克的回信因故耽搁，她就会惊恐不安，就像一个情人那样牵肠挂肚，会在信中写这类话：“也许我使你厌烦了。”“可能我太冒昧了。”或者：“夜间睡不着，我一直在想你也许病了。”

迪克倒确实病了，得了流感。康复之后，他仍感到身体疲倦，除了正常的通信之外，其他的事情一概懒得做。不久，他对她的思念就被奥布河畔巴尔城司令部的一个来自威斯康星[12]的女话务员所取代了——该女子活生生地就在眼前，描眉涂唇，像个招贴女郎，士兵们在食堂吃饭时淫秽地称之为“交换台”。

就在迪克遐想不已时，弗朗茨回到了办公室，神情颇为自得。迪克心想弗朗茨可能会成为一个优秀的临床医生，因为他说话声音洪亮，音调抑扬顿挫，对护士和病人指挥若定，但他的话语并非出自真心，而是出于一种强烈而又与人无害的虚荣。弗朗茨善于自控，对自己真实的感情含而不露。

“现在来谈谈那个女孩吧，迪克。”他说，“当然，我也想了解你，想听你谈谈你自己。不过，还是先说那女孩吧。关于她，有些情况我老早就想告诉你了。”

他从档案柜里找出一叠纸，但翻了翻之后，觉得反而妨碍他叙述，于是便把纸放到办公桌上，对迪克讲起了那个女孩的故事。





第三章


大约一年半之前，多姆勒医生曾和一个住在洛桑的美国绅士泛泛地通过几封信。此人就是芝加哥沃伦家族的德弗鲁·沃伦先生。他们商定见一次面。一天，沃伦先生带着他十六岁的女儿尼科尔来到了诊所。小姑娘显然有点不正常，陪同她一道来的护士带她到院子里散步，而沃伦先生则和医生进行交谈。

沃伦是个美男子，长得一表人才，看上去还不到四十岁。他举手投足都有着浓浓的美国味，高个子，宽肩膀，身材匀称——多姆勒医生对弗朗茨形容他是个“英俊潇洒的人”。由于常在日内瓦湖荡舟，在太阳下暴晒，沃伦那双灰色大眼睛的眼角生出了皱纹。他身上有一种独特的气质，似乎人情世故无不洞悉。他们用德语交谈——沃伦曾在哥廷根[13]读过书。说话时，他看上去有些紧张，显然此次来访对他有不小的触动。

“多姆勒医生，我女儿的脑子不太正常。我给她请过许多专家和护士，她也接受过几次疗养，但问题越来越严重，叫我不知如何是好了。有人极力建议我来找你。”只听他说道。

“很好，”多姆勒医生说，“请你从头开始，把一切都告诉我吧。”

“真不知从何说起。至少，在我和她母亲两家是没有精神病人的。她十一岁的时候，她的母亲便去世了，所以我又当爹又当妈，幸好有家庭女教师助我一臂之力，才使得她没有缺失父爱和母爱。”

他说这些时，情绪很激动。多姆勒医生看到他眼角闪着泪光，也就是在这时闻到他呼出的气息中带着酒味。

“她小时候十分乖巧，所有的人都喜欢她，可以说是人见人爱。她聪明伶俐，整天快快乐乐的，不是看书、绘画，就是跳舞、弹琴，总是闲不住。我常听见我妻子说，在我们的孩子当中，只有她夜间从来不哭不闹。我还有一个大女儿，另外有过一个男孩，去世了，而尼科尔……尼科尔……尼科尔……”

说到这里，他再也说不下去了。多姆勒医生接住他的话头说：“那时她是个十分正常的孩子，无忧无虑，幸福快乐。”

“对极了。”

多姆勒医生等着他朝下说。沃伦先生摇摇头，长长地叹了口气，飞快朝多姆勒医生看了一眼，便又盯着地面说道：“大约八个月前（也许是六个月前或十个月前吧）——现在让我说，我也记不清是什么时候了，她开始有了一些怪异的行为，做出了一些疯狂的事。最初是她姐姐跟我说起的，因为我觉得尼科尔跟以往没什么两样。”他匆匆地解释道，仿佛有谁在责怪他，要他负责似的，“她还是那个可爱的小姑娘。最初发生的一件事和一个男仆有关。”

“哦，一定是这样的。”多姆勒医生说道，还庄重地点了点头，俨然就像料事如神的夏洛克·福尔摩斯，一到关键时刻就料定会有一个男仆出现——只会是男仆，不可能是其他人。

“我家有个男仆，跟我多年了……顺便说一下，他是瑞士人。”沃伦先生说完，抬头看了看多姆勒医生，觉得对方可能会对自己的同胞表示同情，“对于这个男仆，她产生了一种奇怪的想法，以为对方在勾引她……当然，那时我相信了她的话，叫那个男仆走了。现在我知道她的话都是瞎说。”

“她说过那男仆对她有什么举动吗？”

“这是第一个难点……医生们问她也问不明白。医生一问，她就用那种目光望着医生，就好像他们应该知道那个男仆的行径似的。她一口咬定男仆对她有不规矩的表现，对此她不允许任何人存疑。”

“是吗？”

“当然，我在书上也看到过这样的情节，说有的女子孤寂难耐，就老觉得床下藏着个男人什么的。可是，尼科尔怎么会有这样的念头呢？那么多小伙子，还不都任她挑选！我们曾在湖边森林区住过——那是一个靠近芝加哥的消夏地，我们在那儿有一幢别墅。那时，她每天都出去同男孩子打高尔夫球或者网球。有几个男孩对她动了心，爱得不行。”

沃伦说话时一直盯着多姆勒医生那苍老、皱得像树皮一样的脸，而后者却神游他方，时不时地回忆自己的青春岁月。风华正茂之时，他作为大学的研究员和讲师曾有机会去芝加哥发展，也许在那里可以发财致富，拥有自己的诊所，而不只是在一家诊所里当个小股东。可是，由于当时想到自己对那片广袤的地区，对那儿一望无际的麦田和大草原一无所知，便放弃了这种打算。不过，在那些日子里，他读了一些有关芝加哥的书籍，了解了阿穆尔、帕尔默、菲尔德、克兰、沃伦、斯威夫特、麦考密克及其他许多美国名门望族。打那以后，他没少接诊来自芝加哥和纽约上流社会的病人。

“后来，她的情况急转直下，”沃伦接着说，“她会没来由地发脾气，说出的话越来越离谱，疯疯癫癫的。她姐姐把有些话用笔记了下来……”他把一张叠了好几层的纸递给了医生，“这些话无非就是说有男人要骚扰她——一些男子是她认识的，一些则素昧平生，反正什么样的人都有……”

接下来，沃伦讲述了他们家的恐慌和忧虑，讲述了他们在这种状况下提心吊胆的心情，说他们在美国所做的努力全都宣告无效，最终才觉得换换环境也许会峰回路转。于是，他冲破潜艇的封锁，带着女儿到了瑞士。

“我们是搭乘一艘美国巡洋舰来的。”他有点得意地特地提了一句。“我们得以成行，靠的是运气。还可以补充一句，”他略带歉意地笑了笑说，“正如人们所言：有钱能使鬼推磨。”

“这是当然的。”多姆勒干巴巴地随声附和道。

他感到眼前的这个男人在撒谎，可是不知他为什么要撒谎以及撒的是什么谎。难道他的感觉是错误的？可是，这个身穿花呢外套的英俊男子像个运动员一样悠闲，懒散地坐在椅子上，为什么屋子里就弥漫着一股虚假的气息呢？阳春二月里，一只幼鸟不知怎的折断了翅膀，令人唏嘘！而这里却在演戏，内容过于虚假，叫人感到不对劲儿！

“我想跟她谈一谈，过一会儿再说吧。”多姆勒医生换上了英语，仿佛这么一来可以拉近他同沃伦先生的距离似的。

后来，沃伦把女儿丢下，自己回洛桑了。几天之后，多姆勒医生和弗朗茨开始研究尼科尔的病历：

诊断：精神分裂症。处于急性发作期。其症状是对男子有恐惧感，但这种恐惧并不是先天的……该诊断请予以保留。[14]

沃伦先生答应过几天再来，可是左等右等也不见他露面，使得他们俩越来越焦急。

由于迟迟不见他来，两个星期后，多姆勒医生给他写了封信，然而却如石沉大海。无奈之下，他做了件在当时看来简直是“冒傻气”的事情——他给沃伦先生在沃韦小城暂住的格兰德旅馆挂了一个电话。他从沃伦先生的仆人那儿获悉，沃伦先生正在收拾行李，打算回美国。一想到打这次电话所花的四十瑞士法郎要记在诊所的账上，多姆勒医生心头涌起一股英雄血，非要沃伦先生来听电话不可。

他对沃伦说道：“你必须来一趟——这是绝对有必要的！你来或不来，这关系着你女儿的健康。我不能担这个责任。”

“可是请听我说，医生，你们医生的责任就是给病人治病呀。我有急事要回国去！”

多姆勒医生还从未隔着这么远跟人说过话，但他对着话筒发出了最后通牒，语气非常坚定，迫使电话那端的美国人即便再苦恼也只好让步了。沃伦再次来到了苏黎世湖区，仅仅半小时之后，精神就崩溃了。只见他身穿裁剪合体的外套，伤心地啜泣不止，漂亮的双肩一抖一抖的，眼圈比日内瓦湖上方的太阳还要红。他讲出了一段骇人听闻的往事……

“我不知道……真不知道怎么能出那样的事……”他声音嘶哑地说。

“她母亲去世后，她的年龄还很小。每天早晨她都钻到我的床上来，有时她就睡在我的床上。我心里很可怜这个没有母亲的孩子。后来，每当我们坐汽车或乘火车去旅行，我们总是手拉着手。她常常唱歌给我听。我们常常说这样的话：‘今天下午就咱们俩在一起好啦，不要管别人了……’‘今天上午，你属于我……’”说到这里，他哽咽的声音里出现了自我嘲讽的语气，“人们常说我们是一对多么好的父女啊，还为此感动得落泪。我们俩就像一对情侣，后来突然间竟做出了情侣间的那种事。事情发生后没十分钟，我悔恨交加，恨不得开枪打死我自己。可是，我他妈的是个大软蛋，没有勇气那么做！”

“后来呢？”多姆勒医生嘴上这么问着，心里却又想起了芝加哥，想起了一位脸色有些苍白、戴着夹鼻眼镜的先生——三十年前，那位先生在苏黎世曾盯着他上下打量，“这事又发生过吗？”

“哦，没有！她几乎……她当时像是都呆住了，只是不住地说：‘别担心，别担心，爸爸，这没关系。别担心。’”

“没有产生什么后果吗？”

“没有。”他一哆嗦，抽泣了一声，连着擤了几次鼻子，“可是，现在却出现了许多后遗症。”

听完对方的讲述，多姆勒医生坐在中产阶级家庭中常见的那种摆在屋子中间的扶手椅上，身子向后一靠，心里暗暗骂了一声：“畜生！”二十年来，他很少用这般粗俗的话说别人。末了，他对沃伦建议道：“你最好去苏黎世城里的一家旅馆住上一夜，明天上午再来见我。”

“往后怎么办？”

多姆勒医生把双手一摊，两条胳膊张开，足以抱住一只小猪，说道：“回芝加哥。”





第四章


“这下，我们总算了解了病根。”弗朗茨说道，“多姆勒医生告诉沃伦，说如果他能无限期地（至少在五年内）远离他的女儿，我们就接手这个病案。起初，沃伦精神崩溃后，似乎主要关心的是这件丑事是否会泄露，唯恐此事会传回美国去。

“我们为尼科尔制订了一个医疗方案，疗效有待观察。当时，疗效估计不容乐观——要知道，像她这个年龄，治愈率是很低的，即便所谓的社会平均治愈率也是很低的。”

“她写的头一批信看上去的确有点不对劲儿。”迪克赞同地说。

“十分不对劲儿……非常典型。我曾经犹豫过，不知道该不该允许第一封信从诊所发出去。后来我想，让你了解我们这儿的治疗情况是有好处的，于是就允许了。真难为你了，还写了回信。”

迪克叹了口气说：“唉，那么漂亮的女孩——她随信寄来了许多她的小照。在那一个月里，我反正也没有什么事可做，就给她写了回信。信中也没说别的，只是说‘做个好女孩，听医生的话’什么的。”

“那就够了——这样她就有个人可以交流了。有一段时间，她显得孤零零的——她只有一个姐姐，但二人关系似乎并不很密切。再说，阅读她的信也有助于我们的治疗工作，因为那些信可以反映她的精神状况。”

“这叫我感到高兴。”

“你现在明白是怎么回事了吧？她觉得自己也有罪过——这无关紧要。不过，我们想评估的是她的精神稳定情况以及她人格的力量。她先是受了这样的打击。后来她进了寄宿学校，听到了女孩间的谈话……于是，仅仅出于自我保护的意识，她渐渐产生出一种想法，认为自己没有过错……由此，她就很容易进入一个虚幻世界，觉得天下所有的男人都很坏——她越是喜欢他们、信任他们，就越觉得他们坏……”

“她是一下子就直接陷入了这种恐惧中吗？”

“并非如此。实际上，大约在十月的那段时间，她看上去开始正常起来，我们倒是有些无所适从了。她要是个三十岁的成熟女性倒也罢了，可以让她自我调整，可她年龄那么小，我们生怕她会因为心灵扭曲而变得冷酷无情。于是，多姆勒医生坦率地对她说：‘你现在得担起责任，为你自己负责。这绝不意味着人生的结束，而是意味着人生刚刚开始。’他还说了一些别的开导的话。她天生聪慧，多姆勒医生就让她读了点弗洛伊德的书，量不很大，而她很感兴趣。事实上，我们这儿的人把她当成了宝贝蛋，可是她却少言寡语。”说到此处，弗朗茨犹豫了一下，然后才又说道：“最近，她从苏黎世给你寄了几封信，不知她说的话是否有助于了解她的心理状况以及她未来的打算？”

迪克想了想，然后回答道：“很难说得清……你要看，我下次把信拿来。她似乎很正常，满怀憧憬，对生活充满了希望，甚至还有浪漫情怀。有时她提到‘过去’，就好像自己是个坐过牢的罪犯。但是她语焉不详，不知信里指的是罪行、监禁还是整个经历。说到底，我在她生活中只是一个过客，她没必要对我敞开心扉。”

“当然，我很理解你的处境，再次向你表示我们的感谢。正是鉴于此因，我才想在你见她之前先跟你谈谈。”

迪克哈哈一笑，说道：“你是担心她会投入我的怀抱？”

“不是那个意思，不是那个意思！我只是想让你掌握好分寸而已。你对女性是很具有吸引力的，迪克。”

“哇，真是上天的恩赐！好吧，我会掌握好分寸的，而且要让人讨厌，见她时就嚼几颗大蒜，胡子拉碴的，叫她避之唯恐不及。”

“见病人是不能吃大蒜的！”弗朗茨认了真，正色道，“你可别因此毁了你的职业生涯。不过我知道你在开玩笑。”

“我可以瘸着腿去见她——我住的地方没有像样的浴缸，把腿摔着了嘛。”

“你尽开玩笑。”弗朗茨放下心来——或者说露出了一副放心的样子，“现在说说你自己吧。你有什么打算？”

“我只有一个打算，弗朗茨，那就是做一个出色的心理学家，也许是有史以来最伟大的心理学家。”

弗朗茨愉快地笑起来，但他看出这次迪克不是在开玩笑。

“这很好，很有美国人的豪迈劲儿。”他说，“对我们而言这个目标是很难实现的。”他站起身来，走到落地长窗前，“站在这儿，可以看得到苏黎世城——那儿耸立着苏黎世大教堂[15]的尖塔。我的祖父就葬在那个教堂的墓穴里。从那儿穿过一座小桥就是我的祖先拉瓦特尔[16]长眠的地方——他不愿意葬在教堂墓穴里。附近则立着我的另一位祖先海因里希·佩斯塔洛齐[17]的塑像及阿尔弗雷德·埃舍尔[18]博士的一尊塑像，而最叫人顶礼膜拜的还是茨温利[19]。我始终要面对的是一大群无法超越的民族精英。”

“是的，我明白。”迪克站了起来，说道，“我只是说说大话而已。一切还刚开始。大多数在法国的美国人都急于回国，而我却不然——我只要到大学里听听课，一年里的军饷照拿不误。美国政府规模宏大，能培养出未来人才，这点钱又算得了什么！不过，我想先回国一个月，看看老父亲，然后马上回来……有人给了我一份工作。”

“在哪儿工作？”

“在你们的竞争对手那儿，即位于因特拉肯湖畔的吉斯勒诊所。”

“千万别去！”弗朗茨忠言相告说，“他们一年只收治十多个年轻病人。吉斯勒本人就是个狂躁的抑郁症患者。他妻子和她的情夫在经营这家诊所……当然，你知道这是咱俩私下说的。”

“你以前所说的到美国发展的计划怎么样了？”迪克淡淡地问，“咱们可是说好要到纽约去呢，在那儿建立一座现代化诊所，专门收治亿万富翁。”

“那只是上大学时随便说说而已。”

弗朗茨的家紧邻诊所。迪克到他家去，跟他以及他的新婚妻子，还有一条身上有股橡胶烧焦味道的小狗一起吃了顿饭。迪克隐隐产生了一种压抑感——这种压抑感不是由于屋里寒碜的气氛所造成的，也不是因为格雷戈罗维斯夫人而产生的（此人的情况他预先是了解的），而是因为弗朗茨他才有了这种感觉——弗朗茨不思进取，眼光似乎突然变得非常狭隘。在迪克看来，自我修行固然有着不同的标志——可以将之视为实现人生目标的途径，甚至也可以将之视为奋斗中的荣耀，但很难想象一个人竟会苦心孤诣地把继承前人衣钵作为自己的人生目标。弗朗茨和他妻子蜗居于狭小的空间，为区区家务忙得团团转，显得那么庸俗，那么缺乏进取精神。迪克战后在法国住了几个月——在美国光辉的照耀下，法国热火朝天地恢复重建，那种干劲影响了他的世界观。另外，那儿的男男女女都很看得起他。后来，他有一种直觉，认为那儿不适合他这种生性严肃的人，于是便来到了这个伟大的瑞士钟表中心。

他的客套叫卡伊瑟·格雷戈罗维斯产生了错觉，觉得自己很有魅力，而他本人越来越烦躁，感到四周弥漫着庸俗的气味，同时亦在暗暗痛恨自己，觉得自己不知怎的也开始有了浅薄的人生观。

“天呀，我怎么和他们成了一类人？”夜半惊醒，他常常这样想，“我真的跟他们一样了吗？”

这样痛心的反思，对社会上一般人而言是很糟糕的，但对于一个投身于世界上最特殊事业的人而言，则是好事。其实，有几个月的时间，他一直都在反思，回忆着自己青春时代的理想，在决定是否值得为自己不再相信的理想而献身。在惨白的暮色里，他走在华灯初上的苏黎世街头，目光穿过陌生人家的玻璃窗，落在那儿的餐具室里，思如潮涌——他渴望成为一个好人，善良，勇敢，机智，但是谈何容易！同时，如果可能的话，他还渴望受到人们的爱戴。





第五章


落地长窗透出的灯光照亮了中心大楼的过道，纹饰墙壁的暗影以及铁制椅子那古怪的影子拉得长长的，投在剑兰花坛上。过道里有几个人影在慢悠悠走动，沃伦小姐就在其中，起初模模糊糊，后来就清晰可辨了。她一眼瞧见迪克，便迎了过来。就在她跨过门槛时，房间里的灯光照在了她脸上——她出来时，将灯光也带了出来。她走路很有节奏——一个星期以来，她的耳畔仿佛老能听到有人在唱歌，仿佛看得到一幅夏日的美景——天空蔚蓝，树影婆娑。此刻看见迪克翩然而至，那歌声似乎也响遏行云，她真想跟着一起唱起来。

“你好，上尉！”她紧紧盯住迪克的眼睛，很难将目光移开，仿佛二人的目光已经黏合在了一起，“在这儿坐坐好吗？”她静静地站着，向四周扫了几眼，“几乎都入夏了。”

一位妇人跟了出来，胖胖的，披着围巾。尼科尔把她介绍给了迪克：“这位夫人……”

弗朗茨声称有事走掉了。迪克搬来三把椅子，放在了一起。

“多美的夜晚啊。”那位夫人说。

“是啊，多么美啊。”尼科尔随声附和道，接着便转向了迪克，“你在这儿要待很久吗？”

“如果你指的是苏黎世，我是要待很长时间的。”

“现在才真正入春，这是春天的第一个夜晚。”那位夫人说。

“你是说我应该住在这里？”

“至少住到七月份吧。”

“我计划六月走。”

“这儿的六月正是好时候。”那位夫人感慨地说，“你应该在这儿过完六月，在七月份离开，因为那时天就真正热起来了。”

“你打算去哪儿？”迪克问尼科尔。

“和我姐姐一起去旅游，去一个引人入胜的地方——我失去的时光太多了，希望能补回来。不过，他们也许会觉得我应该先去一个幽静的地方——也许去科莫[20]比较好吧。你何不也到科莫去看看呢？”

“哦，科莫嘛……”那位夫人想说什么，却被一阵乐曲声打断了。

大楼里响起了苏佩[21]的三重奏《轻骑兵》。尼科尔乘机站起了身。她那蓬勃的青春气息和如花的容貌强烈震撼着迪克，使得他心潮澎湃、激情涌动。她嫣然一笑，笑得天真、感人——那是在失落的世界里一个纯情少女发出的微笑。

“音乐声太大，听不清说话了……咱们四处走走吧。晚安，夫人。”

“晚安……晚安。”

他们走下两级台阶，来到一条小路上。一道阴影罩在小路上，而尼科尔挽起了迪克的胳膊。

“我有几张我姐姐从美国寄来的唱片，”她说，“你下次来，我放给你听——我知道有个地方可以放唱片，那儿不会有人听见。”

“那倒不错。”

“你听过《印度斯坦》这首曲子吗？”她怀着期待的心情问，“我以前从没有听过，但我喜欢这首曲子。我还有《为什么要把他们叫作宝贝？》和《我很高兴能让你哭》。你在巴黎时大概常跟着这些乐曲跳舞吧？”

“我没去过巴黎。”

走着走着，她身上穿的米色衣服不时变着颜色，时而蓝色，时而灰色，一头金发让迪克目眩神迷——每当他转过脸看她，她总是嫣然一笑。走进路边一座拱形凉亭时，只见她春色满面，犹如一位天使。她对他千恩万谢，就好像他带她参加了一个晚会一样。迪克对他们之间的关系越来越感到没有把握，而她的信心却在增长——她一脸的兴奋，仿佛整个世界都在为这一时刻而兴奋一般。

“我现在无拘无束，一身轻松。”她说，“我会给你放两首好听的曲子的，一首叫《等到牛群回家时》，一首叫《再见，亚历山大》。”

一星期后再次造访时，迪克来得比较晚。尼科尔在小路上等他，那儿是从弗朗茨家过来的必经之地。她的头发拢在耳后，披在肩上，这使她的脸显得像是刚从头发中钻出来一样——此时此刻，她钻出一片密林，来到了皎洁的月光之下。迪克真希望她是个没有背景的女孩，只是迷了路，身后什么都没有，只有一片茫茫的夜色。二人相伴到了她藏留声机的地方，然后在工作间那儿拐了个弯，爬上一块岩石，在一堵矮墙后边坐了下来，眼前除了夜色还是夜色。

他们仿佛置身于美国，弗朗茨曾说迪克是个魅力十足的美男子，但恐怕就连他也想不到他们俩的感情已陷得如此深。他们有时悔恨，有时密不可分；他们乘出租车出外幽会；他们有时相互倾心，脸上堆满甜蜜的微笑，一道在印度斯坦相会，但过后不久却会发生口角，谁也不知道是什么原因，似乎也没人在乎是什么原因——二人最终不欢而散，一个伤心落泪，另一个情绪低落、满腹忧愁。

袅袅的乐曲将失去的时光和未来的希望维系在一起，在瑞士的夜空萦绕。留声机停下来时，蟋蟀则用单音符的鸣叫使得这场音乐会得以持续。有时，尼科尔会关掉留声机，为迪克献上一首歌：

把一枚银圆投到地上，

你看它滚啊滚，

因为它是圆的形状……

她的芳唇一张一合，声音如潺潺流水。迪克听着听着，突然站了起来。

“怎么啦？你不喜欢这首歌？”

“喜欢，当然喜欢。”

“这是我们家的厨子教我唱的。”

女人啊女人，

有眼不识好儿郎，

一旦分手空悲伤……

“你喜欢吗？”

她对他莞尔一笑，深深的情意尽在其中，以此向他表露心迹，不求听到对方的山盟海誓，只求他略有所动，一颗心能和她一块跳动。垂柳飘香，夜色温柔，甜蜜的感情丝丝缕缕融进了她的心田。

她也站起来，被留声机绊了一下，一时间倒在了他身上，滚入他那宽肩膀的凹陷处。

“我还有一张唱片呢。”她说，“你听过《再见，莱蒂》吗？我想你是听过的。”

“说真的，你是不知道……我什么歌也没听过。”

他还想说他不知道有她这样的少女，也没有闻过这样的芬芳，没有品尝过如此甜蜜的感情。他以前只在闷热的密室里接触过几个辣妹，跟她全然不同。1914年在纽黑文的时候，他认识的那些少女个个粗俗，吻过男人之后，便劈胸抓住，一把推开，说一声：“快滚吧！”而现在，这个深陷苦难、尚未完全得救的少女却叫他耳目一新，仿佛发现了一片新大陆……





第六章


他下一次见到她已是五月份。按照他的人生原则，他显然应该远离这个女孩才对。但他经过仔细思考，还是约她到苏黎世城吃了饭。邻桌的一个陌生男子死死盯住她看，目光灼人，一双眼睛像两盏明晃晃的灯，叫人感到不安。迪克温文尔雅地扫了那人一眼，神情里含着恐吓，使得那人收回了目光。

“没什么，只不过是个喜欢偷窥别人的家伙。”他轻松地跟她解释说，“他只是在看你的衣服。你怎么会有这么多各式各样的衣服呢？”

“姐姐说我们很富有，”她谦逊地回答，“祖母去世，留下了许多钱。”

“明白了。”

他比尼科尔年长许多，能够欣赏她那种少女的虚荣和乐趣，欣赏她离开餐馆时在门厅的镜子前孤芳自赏的模样，觉得不受腐蚀的水银镜面有助于她恢复原来的状态。她发现自己既美丽又富有，高兴得手舞足蹈，迪克为之感到欣慰。他真诚地希望她不要有任何感恩的念头，以为是他挽救了她，而是乐于看见她增强自信，觉得没有他的帮助也照样能生活幸福。难就难在，尼科尔最终还是将一切都归功于他，像供奉神灵一样，将供品献于他的脚下。

入夏的第一个星期，迪克又回到了苏黎世城居住。他把他的论文以及服役期间写的东西整理成一部书稿，在此基础上打算修订完《精神病医生心理学》。他胸有成竹，觉得出版是没有问题的，于是跟一个穷学生建立了联系，由那位学生勘正德语的错误。弗朗茨认为此事未免有些操之过急，而迪克却说他写这种题材并不鲁莽，而是十分谨慎的。

“这些东西我熟悉得不能再熟悉了。”他固执地说，“我认为一种理论，不经过实际印证，是不能够成为基础理论的。这一行的遗憾在于，它只对那些身残、心碎的人具有吸引力。在医院的高墙之内，医生们也偏重于临床，即‘实践操作’——以期付出少，见效快。

“而你不同，弗朗茨，你是个好医生——你在娘胎里就注定会成为医生。你应该感谢上帝，因为你无须‘选择’。我之所以成为一个精神病医生，则是因为在牛津大学圣希尔达学院求学时，跟一个女孩同修了一门课。也许，我有些迂腐，但我不会改变我的观点，不会几杯酒落肚便忘乎所以。”

“好吧，”弗朗茨说，“你是个美国人，这样做无损于你的职业。反正我是不喜欢这种笼统的理论的。用不了多久你又会写出什么小书来，叫什么《入门思考》之类的，内容简单，不需要动脑子。要是我父亲还活着，他会看着你，不满地嘟哝几句，迪克。然后他会拿起餐巾，这么叠着，抓着他的餐巾环，就是这一个……”他将餐巾环举起来，可以看见棕色木头上刻着一个野猪头，“他会说：‘哦，我的印象是……’随后，他会瞅着你。突然觉得自己的劝告不顶用，索性也就不说了，而是会再嘟哝几句。这时，我们的饭也就吃完了。”

“今天我孤身一人，”迪克有些不耐烦地说，“但也许明天就不会是一个人了。以后，我就要像你父亲一样叠餐巾、发牢骚什么的了。”

弗朗茨沉吟了片刻，然后问道：“咱们的病人怎么样了？”

“不太清楚。”

“哦，到现在你该很了解她了吧。”

“我喜欢她。她很有魅力，你要我做什么……带她去观赏火绒草？”

“不是这个意思。我觉得，既然你在撰写医学书籍，应该有一个方案吧……”

“什么方案？把我的一生献给她？”

弗朗茨冲着正在厨房里忙活的妻子喊了一声：“亲爱的，再给迪克端杯啤酒来！”

“如果必须去见多姆勒，那我就不能再喝了。”

“我们认为最好有一个方案。四个星期过去了……这女孩显然爱上你了。假如在外边，这不关我们的事，但这儿是诊所，就跟我们有着重大关系了。”

“多姆勒医生怎么说，我就怎么做。”迪克同意地说。

话虽如此，但他坚信多姆勒不可能会有多大帮助，认为只有他本人才是决定性的因素。他并非有意为之，但决定权却落在了他手中。这让他想起童年时代的一幕情景——全家上下都在寻找银箱的钥匙，而知道钥匙下落的唯有他一人，因为是他把钥匙藏在了母亲衣柜最上层的抽屉里，就压在手帕底下。可当时的他却袖手旁观，心里觉得此事与己无关。他和弗朗茨一起走向多姆勒教授的办公室时，他的心里又有了同样的感觉。

教授脸上的胡须梳理得整整齐齐，显得很美观，看上去宛如一幢雅致古屋的阳台上爬满了藤蔓。迪克顿生好感。他倒是认识一些有才华的人，但就气质而言，并无一人能胜过多姆勒。

六个月之后多姆勒去世，他望着多姆勒的遗体，心中产生了同样的想法。阳台上的光熄灭了，藤蔓般的胡须触着硬硬的白色衣领，多姆勒那双细缝一般的眼睛曾目击过多少人世间的你争我斗，而今那单薄的眼皮却永远合上了。这些都是后话。

“早安，先生！”迪克打了声招呼，呈立正姿势，仿佛又回到了军队里。

多姆勒教授两手的手指交叉，神态安详，而弗朗茨说话的口吻，忽而像个联络官，忽而又像个秘书。弗朗茨的话还未说完，他的上司就打断了他，温和地说道：“咱们已经有了一定的进展。现在要靠你了，你能帮得上大忙，迪克医生。”

迪克一听要靠他，只好承认说：“其中的脉络我还没有梳理清楚。”

“你个人有什么反应我不管。”多姆勒说。“我只关心一点，”他脸上带着揶揄的神情，瞥了弗朗茨一眼，而后者也露出同样的神情，“那就是所谓的‘移情’必须终止。尼科尔小姐固然恢复得不错，但目前状况仍不稳定，还没有摆脱那次遭遇的影响——她很可能将那次遭遇看成了一场悲剧。”

弗朗茨刚想开口，但多姆勒医生示意他别吱声。

“我明白你处境尴尬。”

“是的，的确如此。”

教授坐了下来，呵呵笑了起来，笑声刚一止，便见他灰色的小眼睛里射出犀利的光，说道：“也许你已经陷入感情的旋涡，无法自拔了。”

迪克意识到自己在被牵着鼻子走，于是也呵呵笑了，然后说道：“她是个漂亮女孩，谁见了都会有所心动的。我并不是有意……”

弗朗茨又想开口，多姆勒止住了他，单刀直入地对迪克提了个问题：“你有没有考虑过一走了之？”

“怕是做不到。”

多姆勒医生转向弗朗茨说：“那就把沃伦小姐送走好啦。”

“怎么好就怎么来吧，多姆勒教授。”迪克做出了让步，“这无疑是一种尴尬的处境。”

多姆勒教授把胳膊架在椅子的扶手上撑起身子，姿势就像是没有腿的人架着双拐，平静地高声说：“不过，这也是一种职业困境。”

随后，他叹口气又坐了下去，静静等待着自己那雷鸣般回荡在屋里的声音渐渐消失。迪克看得出多姆勒已到了生命的尽头，真不知他还能活多久。

那雷鸣般的声音刚一消失，弗朗茨便趁机插话说：“迪克医生是个很有见识的人。我认为他只要能理解现在的处境，就可以很有分寸地处理问题。依我之见，迪克不必离开，可以留在这里继续跟我们合作。”

“你自己怎么看？”多姆勒教授问迪克。

面对这种情况，迪克觉得左右为难。同时，他从多姆勒刚才说话之后的沉默中也意识到，这种消极被动的状况不能无限地持续下去了，于是便一股脑儿将心里的想法全说了出来：“我有点爱上她了……还曾想过要和她结婚。”

“瞧瞧！瞧瞧！”弗朗茨连声说。

“你等一等。”多姆勒不让他说，但弗朗茨拒绝再等，继续说道：“什么！献出你的大半辈子来做医生和护士？这哪里能行！这种事情我可是知道的，十有八九都会无果而终。奉劝你再也不要见她了！”

“依你看呢？”多姆勒问迪克。

“弗朗茨说的当然有道理。”





第七章


这场定策会结束时已近傍晚时分。对迪克的要求是，既要和颜悦色，又要不陷入感情的旋涡。最后，医生们站了起来。迪克朝窗外望去，见外边细雨霏霏，而尼科尔淋着雨在等他。他立刻穿上雨衣，扣上雨衣的领扣，拉低帽檐，向外走去，在大门口的屋檐下跟尼科尔撞了个满怀。

“我找到一个新地方，咱们可以去看看。”她说，“我不愿傍晚时分坐在屋里和病友们闲扯，她们说的话似乎不着边际，叫人听不懂。当然，现在我也明白了，她们是有病嘛，这是……这是……”

“你很快就要走了。”

“哦，是的。我老姐贝丝——大家总叫她芭比——这几个星期就来接我，带我出去旅游，然后把我送回来，在这儿再待最后一个月。”

“你老姐？”

“哦，她比我大得多，今年都二十四岁了。她跟我姑妈住在伦敦，英国味十足。她曾跟一个英国人订了婚，但那个英国人被打死了——我一直都没见过他。”

夕阳透过雨雾洒下淡淡的晚霞，给她那象牙般白皙的面颊上镀上一层金色，使迪克看到了一种前所未见的美——鹅蛋形脸庞，肤色香娇玉嫩，神情淡雅而非狂躁。这种美会叫人想起前途光明的小马驹——如此的人间尤物，其青春绝非昙花一现，而会经久不息地放射光彩；这样的面容，中年仍会美丽如初，老年亦然，因为它的轮廓和五官是永远不变的。

“你在看什么？”

“我在想，你就要过快乐的日子了。”

尼科尔不禁愕然，说道：“我吗？算了吧……情况糟得不能再糟了。”

她把他领到一个柴棚里，盘腿坐在她的高尔夫球鞋上，身上裹着雨衣，双颊被雨水冲洗过后越发显得娇艳。他痴痴地望着她，她也默默地朝他看。她觉得他风度翩翩，即便斜倚在木柱上，也不减玉树临风般的英姿。她深情地看着他的脸——那张脸有时洋溢着喜悦，有时露出自我嘲讽的表情，但过后总会恢复原样，显得严肃和专注。那张脸跟他那微红的爱尔兰人的肤色显得很协调，然而却有几分神秘，这是她极不了解的，甚至有点害怕，但又急于想探个究竟，因为里面包含着男子汉的气概。至于其他方面，他可谓训练有素，一双眼睛里既有彬彬有礼的儒雅，又有体贴入微的深情——对于这些，她跟大多数女性一样心领神会地想据为己有。

“在这家诊所，至少对练习说外语是有好处的。”尼科尔说，“我跟两个医生说法语，跟护士说德语，跟几个清洁女工和一个病人说意大利语什么的，还跟另一个病人学了不少西班牙语。”

“这挺好嘛。”

他试图摆出一种合适的姿态，但不知什么样的姿态最为合适。

“在音乐方面我也很有长进。但愿你不会看低我，以为我只对拉格泰姆音乐[22]感兴趣。我每天都练习……最近几个月，我一直在苏黎世听音乐史课程。实际上，有时支撑着我的正是这一切——音乐和绘画。”她突然弯下身子，将一根踩在鞋底的鞋带拉出来系紧，接着抬起头来，“我想把你现在这个样子画下来。”

她如数家珍般列举了自己的成就，以期获得他的赞许，谁知却叫他感到一阵沮丧。只听他说：“我真羡慕你。我现在除了自己的工作，似乎对什么都不感兴趣。”

“哦，我想这对一个男人来说是好事，”她赶忙说，“但对一个女子而言，我觉得应该懂得琴棋书画，这样有利于相夫教子。”

“我想是这样的。”迪克故作不经意地说。

尼科尔不再吱声。迪克倒希望她说话，如此可以让心情沮丧的他扮演一个较为轻松的角色，然而她默然不语。

“你已经康复了，”他说，“把过去的事争取全都忘了吧。在一两年的时间内别过度劳累。回到美国后，进入社交界，与人相爱……幸幸福福过日子吧。”

“我怕是爱不起来了。”她动了动身子，坐着的那只鞋子从圆木上蹭下了一团泥土。

“你当然会有爱情的，”迪克鼓励地说，“也许这一两年还不会，但这是迟早的事。”接着，他用一种有点强硬的语气说：“你完全可以过正常的生活，生许多漂亮的儿女。你年纪尚小，完全可以恢复过来，一切都将会顺风顺水。年轻人，看着你的女友一个个出嫁，你要是不在乎才怪呢。”

听了这话，她眼里露出痛苦之色，像是吃了难吃的药，满嘴的苦味。

“我这辈子怕是不适合嫁人了。”她凄苦地说。

迪克心情沉重，不知说什么才好。他望着远处的农田，努力想恢复原先那种镇定的神态。

“一切都会好的……这儿所有的人对你都很有信心。格雷戈里医生为你感到自豪，也许将会……”

“我恨格雷戈里医生。”

“哦，你不该恨他。”

尼科尔的世界已经成了碎片，不过这只是一个脆弱的、几乎尚未成型的世界；在她的内心深处，情感和本能仍在进行着不屈的搏斗。就在一个小时前，她在大门口等迪克时，心里还充满了如鲜花一般灿烂的憧憬！

女为悦己者容——但见她衣着齐整，姿容艳丽，犹如一朵娇艳欲滴的水仙，散发出缕缕馨香。

“要是能再次快乐地生活，那该有多好啊！”她吞吞吐吐地说。一时间，她突然产生了一个念头，想对迪克说她是多么富有，家里的房屋是多么高大气派，实际上可以说富比王侯。刹那间，她仿佛成了她的祖父锡德·沃伦——一个腰缠万贯的马贩子。不过，她幸好避开了这种因价值观混淆而产生的诱惑，将这些念头关进了维多利亚时代的闺阁里，她甚至觉得自己现在无家可归，有的只是空虚和痛苦。

“雨停了，该回诊所去了。”

迪克走在她身边，心里能感受得到她的忧伤，恨不能吻一吻她那沾着雨滴的脸颊。

“我有几张新唱片，”她说，“我真想马上就放给你听。你知道……”

那天晚餐时间已过，迪克心乱如麻，觉得必须结束这段感情。他真想踢弗朗茨的屁股一脚，因为可以说是弗朗茨使他陷入了如此纠结的境地。他来到大厅里等着，冲着一顶贝雷帽多看了几眼——这顶贝雷帽看上去跟尼科尔在雨中等他时戴的那顶湿漉漉的贝雷帽很像，但戴帽人却是一个手术不久的病人。那人眼睛骨碌碌一转，看见他后便走了过来，说道：“你好，医生。”

“你好，先生。”

“天气真好。”

“是的，相当好。”

“你现在住在这儿？”

“不，只是今天来看看。”

“哦，很好。好吧……再见，先生。”

迪克不愿跟人接触，很高兴这个戴贝雷帽的可怜人识趣地走开了。他待在大厅里继续等尼科尔。过了一会儿，一个护士下楼来，给他带来一个口信，说道：“沃伦小姐请你原谅，医生。她需要躺一躺。今天晚饭她想在楼上吃。”

护士站在那儿观察他的反应，可能是想看看他是否有怪罪沃伦小姐无礼的神情。

“噢，我知道了。好吧……”他咽了口唾沫，控制了一下情绪说，“希望她很快好起来。谢谢。”

他感到有些困惑，也有几分不满，但总算可以抽身了。

他给弗朗茨留下一张便条，说自己不能和他一起吃晚饭了，然后便穿过田野去了电车站。走上站台，但见春日的晚霞给铁轨和自动售货机的玻璃窗染上了一层黄金色。他感到车站和诊所之间有两种力量在起作用——一种是离心力，一种是向心力。这叫他有点不知所措。令他高兴的是，就在这时电车来了，脚下那坚实的苏黎世鹅卵石铺就的站台在微微颤动。

第二天，他期待着能接到尼科尔的电话，但左等右等也没有电话打过来。他心想她可能病了，于是就打电话到诊所向弗朗茨了解情况。

“她昨天和今天都是下楼吃的饭，”弗朗茨说，“她像是有什么心事，愁眉不展的。究竟是怎么回事？”

迪克真想能解释得清楚两性之间那深不可测的关系。

“我们的关系没有发展到那一步……至少我是这么看的。我努力保持一段距离，但我认为她陷得很深，不会因为我表现淡漠就转变态度的。”

他也许因为自己的虚荣心受到了尼科尔的伤害，也就不顾体面地如此说道。

“但从她对护士所说的一些话看来，我倒是觉得她是知道自己的处境的。”

“那倒好。”

“能出现这种情况再好不过了。她似乎并非魂不守舍的模样，只是有点阴郁罢了。”

“那倒是挺好的。”

“迪克，早点儿来看我哟。”





第八章


接下来的几个星期，迪克感到很失落。他和尼科尔的关系本身就有着病态的因素，中途失败也是很自然的，这叫他不胜惆怅和伤感。莫非他不公正地利用了尼科尔的感情？莫非是他自作多情？不管怎样，目前他必须快刀斩乱麻，斩断这段幸福的情缘。可是在梦中，他梦见她沿着诊所的那条小路朝他走来，手里挥动着她的宽边草帽……

一次，在现实生活中，他走过皇宫旅馆时，看见她就在面前。当时，一辆豪华的劳斯莱斯轿车拐进了旅馆半月形的大门，尼科尔和一位年轻女子坐在车里，他猜想那位女子就是尼科尔的姐姐。她俩坐在庞大的车身里显得十分娇小，运载她们的车子则有一百匹马力的超大动力。尼科尔也看见了他，两片嘴唇顿时惊讶得张了开来。迪克推推帽子，走过去了。然而，他像着了心魔，仿佛看见无数魔鬼盘旋在苏黎世大教堂的上空，那声音震耳欲聋。他坐下来继续写病情记录，试图忘掉这次邂逅。病情记录里详细记载了尼科尔所面临的严峻形势——如果再有一次“打击”（在这个世界上，这样的“打击”是不可避免的），她又会旧病复发。这份记录会叫天下人都相信，唯独他自己不会相信。

他想忘掉她，但欲罢不能，这才意识到自己在感情的旋涡里已经陷得有多深。他痛下决心，决定一定要找到自救的良方。良方之一：他给那位奥布河畔巴尔城的女接线员打了个电话——此人正在环欧洲旅游，从尼斯逛到科布伦茨[23]，想要在这个千载难逢的假日里同她认识的男人们逐一幽会。良方之二：他打算在八月里坐政府的包船回国去。良方之三：自然是发奋工作，加紧校对他的专著，以期秋季将之呈献给通行德语的精神病学界。

他的研究已经超出了这本书的范围，现在要做的是向纵深发展，如果能获得交流性的研究员职位，便可以大有所为。

同时，他还计划进行一项新的研究：对克雷佩林之前及克雷佩林之后的一千五百个病例的考查结果进行统一的、具有实效性的分类，其中包括神经官能症和精神错乱症，然后用当代不同的学术观点进行诊断（这又是一个宏大的工程），还要按时间顺序列出一个独立学术观点分类表。

这个项目用德语命名，看上去会显得意义深重……

……

迪克慢慢地骑着自行车，进了蒙特勒[24]，不时可以眺望到朱根角的山影，湖岸上旅馆鳞次栉比，湖水波光粼粼，令人观之目眩。他注意到，经过了四年新兴之后，又有英国人成群结队地出现了，他们走路时眼睛里流露出狐疑之色，一个个就像侦探小说里的人物，仿佛置身于险地，时时都可能会遭到训练有素的德国歹徒的袭击。在这片由一道山涧冲刷形成的碎石岗上，建筑星罗棋布，到处是复苏的景象。向南走到伯尔尼和洛桑，一路上不时有人向迪克打听，问他今年会不会有美国游客来。他的回答总是：“会有的，他们七月不来，八月准来。”

他下穿皮短裤，上穿军人衬衫，脚蹬登山鞋，背包里装一套棉布衣服和换洗的内衣。来到格里昂的缆车站口，他检查了一下自行车，在车站快餐部的露天平台要了一小瓶啤酒，一边喝一边观看那甲壳虫般的小缆车沿着八十度的坡度慢悠悠向山下开去。他的耳朵里有血块，那是他在佩尔自行车大赛中疯狂飙车留下的遗憾（当时，他自以为是个了不起的运动员）。他问服务员要了点酒精，清洗了一下耳朵。这时，缆车进站了。他看到他的自行车被装上了缆车，便把背包放进缆车下层的行李箱，自己也跟着上了缆车。

高山缆车的车身具有一定的斜度，看上去就像一个人不愿被认出，压低了帽檐一般。车厢下有排水槽，蓄积的水就从那儿排出——其设计之精巧令迪克赞叹不已。此刻，一辆对应的缆车正在山顶装水，它会利用重力将放水后变轻的缆车拉上去。这样的创意简直巧之又巧！旁边有两个英国人在议论缆车的缆绳。

“英国产的缆绳总能用上五六年的。两年前，德国产的缆绳在价格上比咱们的低。但你猜他们的缆绳用了多长时间？”

“多长时间？”

“一年零十个月。后来，瑞士人将那些缆绳转卖给了意大利人——意大利人在检查质量方面是很不严格的。”

“谁都知道，在瑞士，要是缆绳断了，势必会产生灾难性的后果。”

售票员关上门，跟山上的同事通了电话。接着，缆车的车身一晃，便被拉着朝苍翠的山峰驶去，从一些低矮房屋的上方越过。随后，沃州、瓦莱州、萨瓦和日内瓦的天空便以全景画面的形式徐徐展现在游人面前。罗讷河激流澎湃，水流冲入湖的中央，使那儿的水变得凉爽，而此处是西方世界真正的中心。湖面上游弋的天鹅犹如点点白帆，而来往的船只则像游弋的天鹅——天鹅和船只都消融在一片缥缈的天然美景之中。天空晴朗，灿烂的阳光倾洒在缆车脚下克萨尔那绿绿的草场和白白的网球场上。网球场上有人在打球，然而却没有投下阴影。

当西庸城堡[25]和萨拉格隆孤岛宫殿映入眼帘时，迪克却将目光移向了缆车的车厢内。此时，缆车已经开到了湖边几幢最高房屋的上方。两侧，绿叶和鲜花交织在一起，相映成趣，色彩斑斓——这是索道花园。车厢内贴着告示：禁止摘花。

尽管一路不许摘花，但所过之处尽有鲜花可以观赏——每节过往的缆车耐心而轻缓地扫过多萝西·珀金斯玫瑰花[26]，这些花随着缆车的晃动而轻摆腰肢，缆车过后它们才最终摇晃着回归玫瑰花丛。这些花枝一次又一次与缆车擦身而过。

在上边，即在迪克前边的车厢里，一群英国人站在那儿，对蓝天和群山构成的美景赞叹不已。突然，他们中间起了骚动，人群向两边散开，给一对年轻人让道。那一男一女两个年轻人一边连连道歉，一边来到了缆车的后车厢（即迪克所在的车厢）。男的是个拉丁人，一双眼睛像毛绒玩具鹿的眼睛，而女的则是尼科尔。

这两个不速之客累得喘了几口粗气，然后坐下来说说笑笑，将同座的英国人挤到了拐角。尼科尔看见迪克，跟他打了声招呼。她看上去十分可爱。迪克觉得她和以前有点不一样了，定睛一看才发现是她的发型变了，变得精致了，剪得短短的，像艾琳·卡索[27]那样的发型，蓬松鬈曲。她上穿一件粉蓝色羊毛衫，下穿一条白色的网球裙——像五月的第一个上午般艳丽，在诊所时的那种抑郁气息已荡然无存。

“哎呀！”她喘着气说，“可把那个保安气坏了。一到站，他们非得扣下咱俩不可。这位是戴弗医生，这位是马尔莫拉伯爵。”

“真够呛！”她抚了抚新做的头发，仍气喘吁吁，“姐姐买了头等车厢的票，对她来说这是个原则问题。”她和马尔莫拉交换了一下眼色，然后大声说：“结果，我们发现所谓的头等车厢只不过是司机身后的一节车厢，像是灵车，用防雨的窗帘遮得严严实实，什么也看不见。但没办法，姐姐最讲究的就是体面……”说到这里，她和马尔莫拉又大笑起来，两人一副亲密无间的样子。

“你们上哪儿？”迪克问。

“去考克斯[28]。你呢？”尼科尔问着，看了看他身上的装束，“放在前头的那辆自行车是你的吗？”

“是的。我准备星期一下山到湖边去。”

“能让我坐在你的车把上吗？我可是说真的……行吗？我觉得这比什么都好玩。”

“那可不行。我要抱你下山呢。”马尔莫拉提出了强烈的抗议，“我要穿上溜冰鞋带你滑下去……或者，我干脆把你扔下山去，让你就像一片羽毛那样慢慢地飘下山。”

尼科尔一想到自己像羽毛一样飘下山，而不是似铅锤那般朝下坠，便乐得眉开眼笑。这时，她高兴得忘乎所以，又是故作羞涩，又是忸怩作态，又是挤眉弄眼，又是手舞足蹈——不过，昔日灾难的阴影会间或出现在她的脸上，使她黯然神伤。迪克希望自己能远远离开她，唯恐他在跟前会叫她想起已被她抛在身后的往事。他决定换个下榻地，到另一家旅馆去住。

缆车停了下来，初坐缆车的游客见自己悬在半空中，不由感到忐忑不安。其实，这只是上山缆车和下山缆车的售票员在进行交接罢了。随后，缆车又开动了，越升越高，从一条林中小道和一道峡谷上方越过，接着到了一座山冈的上空。只见这里漫山遍野都是水仙花——花、人和天融为了一体。现在看那些在蒙特勒湖边球场打网球的人，就只有针尖那么大了。这儿空气清新——清新的空气中飘荡着悠扬的音乐。缆车徐徐滑入格里昂，他们发现原来是有一支乐队在旅馆的花园里演奏。

他们换乘山间的火车时，缆车的水箱开始放水——哗哗的流水声淹没了音乐声。考克斯村几乎就悬在头顶上，旅馆的一扇扇窗户在夕阳的照耀下像一团团燃烧的火焰。

乘客们在前往考克斯村的路上却别有一番感受——一台大功率机车推着客车车厢转着圈朝上爬，一圈又一圈，作螺旋状前进，呼哧呼哧地在低垂的云层里穿行。机车斜着身子，喷出的烟雾一时间让迪克连尼科尔的脸都看不清了。他们迎着微风朝上爬，每爬一圈，旅馆就变大一点。最后，他们惊奇地发现，他们已经抵达了阳光灿烂的山顶。

乘客们忙着下车。迪克背上背包，到站台去取他的自行车。这时尼科尔来到他身边问：“你不住这家旅馆吗？”

“我想省点钱。”

“那你下来跟我们一起吃晚饭吧？”（乘客们都在取自己的行李，场面乱糟糟的。）“这是我姐姐……这是苏黎世来的戴弗医生。”

迪克朝一位年轻女子欠了欠身。那女子约莫二十五岁，高个儿，显得很自信的样子。他不禁心想：有些女子面容如花，需要套嚼子驯服，而眼前的这个女子看上去盛气凌人，其实很脆弱。

“我晚饭后再来拜访吧，”迪克答应道，“我得先适应一下环境。”

他骑自行车离开时，能感觉到尼科尔在恋恋不舍地目送他，能感觉到她的那种无助的初恋，而他自己心里也有着千回百转的柔情。他沿着山坡爬了三百码，来到另一家旅馆，要了一个房间。洗澡时，他发现自己有十分钟什么也记不得了，就像喝多了酒一样只觉得晕乎乎的，耳旁似乎有几个人在说话，而那些人都是不相干的局外人，不清楚尼科尔爱他爱得有多深。





第九章


他们在等他——没有他在场，他们觉得似乎缺了什么。可是，他来不来却是个未知数。沃伦小姐以及那位意大利小伙子和尼科尔一样，显然也等得焦心如焚。旅馆的客厅豪华气派，据说有神奇的音响效果，此时已腾空，准备举办舞会。可是，厅里只有几个上了年纪的英国妇人，围着颈带，染了头发，涂脂抹粉，脸色青灰；还有几个中年美国女子，戴着雪白的假发，身着黑衣，嘴唇涂成了樱桃红。沃伦小姐和马尔莫拉坐在墙角的一张桌子旁。尼科尔则坐在距他们四十码远的斜对面，迪克一进来就听到了她的说话声：“我用正常的声音说话，你们能听见吗？”

“听得很清楚。”

“你好，戴弗医生。”

“这是在干什么？”

“你们注意到没有，房间中央的人听不见我说话，但你们能听见，是不是？”

“服务员介绍过这种现象，”沃伦小姐说，“在这儿，声音的传播是从一个墙角传到另一个墙角——就像无线电讯号的传播。”

置身于山巅，犹如乘船航行在茫茫的大海之上，人人都感到兴奋。过了一会儿，马尔莫拉的父母走了过来。他们对沃伦姐妹非常尊重——迪克推测他们的财产同米兰的一家银行有关，而那家银行又同沃伦家的资产有关……但芭比·沃伦想同迪克说话，她心里有一种冲动——正是这种冲动使得她见了新结识的男人就想扑过去，仿佛身上拴着一根没有弹性的绳子，非得把绳子拽得紧得不能再紧才肯罢休。但见这位高挑的处女一副坐立不安的样子，一会儿跷起腿，一会儿又把腿放下。

“尼科尔告诉我，说你照顾过她，为她身体的康复操了不少心。我们也不知道该怎么办才好……诊所里的人说话模棱两可，只是说她应该顺其自然，心情放轻松一些。这次，我知道马尔莫拉一家会来，所以我让蒂诺在缆车站等我们。你看看他们都干了些什么——尼科尔一见他，就让他爬缆车，两人就好像是疯子……”

“这很正常。”迪克笑道，“我要说这是一个好现象。他们这是在向对方展现自我嘛。”

“反正我是无法理解。在苏黎世城，我还没弄清是怎么回事，她几乎就当着我的面把头发给剪了，就因为《名利场》中的一幅插图。”

“那很正常。她患有精神分裂症，做事难免会有些古怪，改是改不了的。”

“你说什么？”

“我是说她做事有些古怪。”

“哦，是古怪还是发疯，谁又能区别得了呢？”

“绝对不是发疯——尼科尔精神很好，心情也愉快，你不用担心。”

芭比换了一下跷着的腿。尽管她同那个战死的近卫军军官的婚事已化为泡影，以悲剧告终，使得她有些呆滞、伤感，但她仍然不知餍足，跟百年前那些曾经爱过拜伦[29]的女子一个样。

“我不管什么责任不责任，”她说道，“但我实在是一头雾水，不明白是怎么回事。我们家以前从未遇见过这种事。尼科尔显然受到了刺激，我觉得肯定跟哪个男孩子有关，但究竟是何人谁都不清楚。父亲说一旦查出是谁，非杀了他不可。”

这时，乐队在演奏《可怜的蝴蝶》。小马尔莫拉同他的母亲翩然起舞。听着这支曲子，他们都觉得新鲜。迪克一边听曲子，一边看着正在与老马尔莫拉交谈的尼科尔的肩膀。老马尔莫拉的头发扑了白粉，看上去像钢琴的键盘，这使迪克联想起小提琴的肩托，又想到那桩丑事，那个秘密。乐曲在他的耳边回响：

啊，可怜的蝴蝶呀，一失足便成千古恨……

“实际上，我倒有个计划，”芭比带点歉意地接着说道，语气显得有些生硬，“也许你觉得这绝对行不通，但他们说尼科尔这几年需要照料。我不知道你是否熟悉芝加哥……”

“我不熟悉。”

“是吗？那儿有北区和南区之分，差别很大。北区环境优美，我们常常住在那儿，起码也有许多年头了。不过，很多旧世家，芝加哥的古老家族，希望你能明白我所说的话，仍然住在南区。芝加哥大学也在南区。对有些人来说，那地方恐怕沉闷乏味，但不管怎样，与北区相比，却有其独特之处。不知道你是否能明白我的意思。”

他点了点头。他集中注意力还是能够听明白她的话的。

“当然，我们家在那儿人脉很广……父亲在大学里控制着一些教授职位和研究员的位置，还有其他的一些东西。我觉得如果带尼科尔回国，让她进入那个圈子……你了解她，她很有音乐天赋，并且会说多种语言……像她这种状况，如果能爱上一位出色的医生，可能会有柳暗花明的转机……”

迪克禁不住乐得直想笑。哈，沃伦家族要给尼科尔买一个医生女婿喽！他心想：“有个出类拔萃的女婿，能不能借给我们用一下呢？”既然她家里能给尼科尔买一个优秀的年轻医生当乘龙快婿，他也就不必为她操心了。脸上的笑意几乎还没有消失，他便随口问道：“那个医生物色好了吗？”

“肯定会有很多人打破头都想争取到这个机会。”

跳舞的人回到了座位上。芭比压低声音急促地说：“我要说的就是这件事。哦，尼科尔跑到哪里了？她怎么走了！是不是上楼去她自己的房间了？我该怎么办呢？真不知由她去好呢，还是去找她好。”

“也许，她只是想清静清静——她老是一个人，已经习惯了过清净日子。”迪克见对方没在听，于是便又说：“我出去随便看看。”

外边暮色苍茫，就好像罩了几道帷幕的春天，远处什么也看不见，只好在旅馆附近转转了。从旅馆地下室的窗户旁走过，他看见几个服务员坐在地下室的床上，一边喝西班牙葡萄酒，一边在斗牌。他迈着步子来到游廊时，天空已有星星在高耸的、白雪皑皑的阿尔卑斯山峰那儿闪烁。远远望见尼科尔一动不动地站在小径的两根灯柱之间，从那儿可以俯视湖面，于是他便穿过草地悄悄地走了过去。尼科尔转过身来，露出惊异的表情，仿佛在责备他不该来。一时间他后悔得不得了，觉得自己的确不该来。

“你姐姐在为你担心呢。”

“明白了！”她已习惯了被人严加看守，于是便解释了几句，“有时候我有点……有点受不了。我的日子一直都过得平静如水，可今晚的音乐搅得我心乱，使我直想哭……”

“我理解你的心情。”

“今天是个叫人无比兴奋的日子。”

“我不想扫大家的兴——我给大家添的麻烦已经够多的了。不过，今晚我就是想离开人群，自己清静清静。”

这时，迪克就像一个垂死的人忘记了说出遗嘱放在何处，临终前才突然记了起来——他记起多姆勒和他身后的那些若隐若现的“几代人”曾对尼科尔进行过“再教育”。他觉得有些细节应该让尼科尔知道，但转念一想，觉得眼下还不是时候，于是就将要说的话咽了回去，审时度势地说：“你是个挺不错的人……你应该相信自己，对自己有个正确的判断。”

“你喜欢我吗？”

“当然。”

“你愿意……”尼科尔说着话，一边和他一道沿着马蹄形的小径散步，朝着两百码开外小径那黑暗一片的尽头走去，“如果我没病，你是不是愿意……我是说你是不是愿意我这样的女孩……哎呀，不说啦，你知道我的意思。”

此时此刻，迪克已经失去了理智。她靠得这么近，使得他呼吸加快。但就在这时，他所受过的训练帮了他的忙。只见他像个孩子一样咯咯一笑，然后发表了一通陈腐的议论：“你说这话只是开个玩笑。我以前认识个医生，他跟一个护士坠入了爱河……”他一边走着，一边滔滔不绝地讲起了那件风流案。后来，尼科尔突然打断了他的讲述，冒出了一句芝加哥的土话：“活见鬼！”

“这话可是有点太粗俗了。”

“那又怎样？”她怒气冲冲地说，“你别以为我不谙风情。生病之前我的确对这种事一无所知，但现在我什么都知道。你别以为我仍然还昏头昏脑，不知道你是我见过的最有魅力的男子。我固然命运坎坷……但你也别装蒜，以为我不知道！你和我之间有什么感应，我一清二楚！”

一席话顿时叫迪克觉得自己处于劣势。他想起尼科尔的姐姐说要给她在芝加哥南区的知识分子圈子里买年轻医生的话，不由狠下心来说道：“你是个可爱的小姑娘，但我是不能谈恋爱的。”

“你不愿意给我一个机会？”

“什么机会？”

尼科尔语言唐突、态度咄咄逼人，让迪克吃惊。他心慌意乱，想不出尼科尔·沃伦意欲得到的是什么机会。

“现在就给我一个机会吧。”

她边说边凑了上来，声音变得很低，仿佛那声音发自于胸腔，她酥胸高挺，把胸口的衣服绷得紧紧的。迪克吻到了她的芳唇，他搂住她，搂得越来越紧，而她依偎在他的怀里，如释重负地长嘘了一口气。此刻的迪克欲罢不能，平时的谨慎已不复存在，即便他有意要抽出身去也不可能了——二人已胶合在一起，不可分割（你就是把他们硬分开，他们也不能恢复到原来独立的状态了）。他抱住她，品尝着她的芬芳，而她紧贴在他身上，越贴越紧，两片芳唇似乎焕发出了新生，忘情地吻着，沉浸和融化在爱河之中，一颗心感到欣慰和自得。迪克已感受不到自身的存在，即便能感受得到，也只是因为可以在她的一双水汪汪的大眼睛里看到自己的映影。

“天哪，”他喘口气说，“跟你亲吻真是美妙。”

此时，尼科尔已牢牢吸引住了他，将他控制在了手心，听了这话，反倒卖弄起了风情，抽身离开了他，就像下午在缆车站一样，使他感到茫然。她心想：“先给他点颜色瞧瞧，别让他把尾巴翘得太高，对我为所欲为。啊，真是太好了，我终于得到他了，他现在属于我了！”她飘然若仙，感到生活焕然一新，是如此美好，她要细细地、慢慢地品尝这姗姗来迟的幸福。

就在这时，她突然身子一哆嗦，眼睛望着两千英尺高的山下——蒙特勒和沃韦灯火闪烁，那灯光犹如发光的项链和手镯，而更远处则是洛桑市，朦朦胧胧的，似一个吊坠。山下隐约传来舞会的音乐声。她定下心，让大脑冷静下来，不由回忆起了少女时代那段令人感伤的往事，犹如一个人在经历过心理搏斗之后有意要借酒浇愁。这时，迪克已来到她的身旁，潇洒地斜倚在小径边的铁栏杆上。对于他，她仍有几分怯意，喃喃地说道：“记得那天我在花园里等你，把我的心捧在手里，犹如捧着一篮鲜花，准备把它献给你。我当时就是怀着那样的心情……我觉得自己是怀揣着一片真情。”

迪克从后边伏在她的肩头，听了这话，便扳她双肩令她转过身来。她搂着他的双肩，一连吻了他多次，而每一次都使得他把她的娇容看得越发真切。

“雨下大了。”

突然，湖对面暗红色的山坡上传来轰隆一声响——人们在向酝酿冰雹的云层开炮，以便驱散它们。步道上的灯灭了，随后又亮了。接着，暴雨骤至，先是从天上倾泻而下，随后便见山洪奔腾而来，淹没了道路，灌满了石砌的沟渠。天空一片漆黑、异常恐怖，一道道闪电狂怒地划破夜空，雷声震天动地，似乎要毁掉一切的乱云从旅馆旁飞驰而过。湖光山影顿然消失，旅馆蜷缩在喧闹、混乱的茫茫黑暗之中。

迪克和尼科尔走进旅馆的前厅，见芭比·沃伦和马尔莫拉一家三口正在那儿焦急地等他们。冲过雨雾返回旅馆，这段经历令人感到兴奋。当旅馆的大门在他们身后砰地关上时，他们站在前厅里，乐得直笑，激动得浑身发抖——狂风仿佛仍在耳边呼啸，衣服被大雨浇得湿湿的。此刻，舞厅里的乐队正在演奏施特劳斯[30]的华尔兹舞曲，曲调热烈，令人亢奋。

……戴弗医生要娶一个精神病患者吗？这是怎么回事？此话从何谈起？

“你去换换衣服，然后再过来好吗？”芭比·沃伦仔细瞧了他几眼说。

“我没带换洗的衣服，只带了几件短裤。”

迪克借了件雨衣披上，深一脚浅一脚地回他下榻的旅馆，心里一边在暗自嘲笑：“真是机缘凑巧啊！哼，他们不是还要买一个医生当乘龙快婿嘛！那就让他们在芝加哥好好找吧，看他们能找个什么好女婿！”可他又觉得自己这样想未免太刻薄，十分对不起尼科尔——他回想起了她那无与伦比的娇嫩的芳唇给他带来的快感，想起雨点落在她如白瓷般细腻光洁的面颊上，仿佛在为他淌泪……这天夜里约莫三点钟，他一觉醒来，外面已经风停雨住。他走到窗前，仿佛觉得她从那连绵起伏的群山中向他走来，幽灵般掀开窗帘进了屋，发出窸窸窣窣的声音……

……次日上午，他爬了两千米，来到罗耶峰[31]上，惊异地发现昨天的那个缆车售票员今天休假，也来爬山了。

下山后，他跑到蒙特勒去游了一会儿泳，回到旅馆时正赶上吃晚饭。有两封短信在等着他。

一封是尼科尔的，上面写着：“昨晚的事，我不感到后悔——那是我一生中最美好的时刻。即便今生今世再也见不到你，我的上尉，我的心里也会为那一时刻充满喜悦。”

这几句话令他感到欣慰，多姆勒布下的那团阴云刹那间消散了。他打开第二封短信，下面的一段文字映入了眼帘：

亲爱的戴弗医生：

我给你打电话，但你出门去了。不知能否请你帮我一个大忙。发生了一件意外的事情，我需要返回巴黎。为节省时间，我决定从洛桑走。既然你下周一踏上归途，能否让尼科尔跟你一起坐车回苏黎世，然后把她留在诊所？这个请求是否太过分了？

诚挚的

贝丝·埃文·沃伦

迪克火冒三丈——沃伦小姐明知他是骑自行车来的，却提这样的要求！可是，对方措辞委婉，让他无法拒绝。好一个别有用心的姐姐，还有沃伦家的臭钱，竟然硬将他和尼科尔一对孤男寡女抛在了一起！

实际上，他猜错了，因为芭比·沃伦并没有这样的意图。她曾用世故的眼光细细观察过他，还用英国人的那种严苛的择婿标准衡量过他，觉得他虽然一表人才，但尚有欠缺。在她看来，他“书生气”太重，跟她在伦敦认识的那帮穷酸儒生别无两样——他装腔作势，有点华而不实。她觉得他不可能成为她心目中的那种贵族型女婿。

此外，她觉得他有一股牛脾气——交谈时，她注意到他数次显出爱听不听的样子，人在跟前，而神游他方，怪里怪气的。尼科尔小的时候，她就觉得尼科尔我行我素，做事随随便便，现在更觉得尼科尔“不可救药”了。反正不管怎么说吧，她是不愿意在家里看到迪克这样的医生女婿的。

她只是要图个方便，想利用他一下而已。

岂不知她的请求却对迪克产生了影响，使他误以为她别有用心。坐火车返回是一段很糟糕的旅程——他心情沉重，同时又觉得有点滑稽，无异于在经历一次磨难。他觉得自己不是和尼科尔在一起，而是跟一个朋友胡乱选了个日子出来旅行，上午匆匆忙忙赶车，肚子饿了就吃几口东西垫补，时间长得难熬。下午，旅途渐渐接近终点，时间的进程仿佛也加快了。尼科尔一副郁郁寡欢的模样，让他看了心里难受。不过，这对她而言也许是一种解脱，因为她就要回到她唯一熟悉的家了。一路上，他们没有温存的话语，没有爱的举动，但二人走到苏黎世湖区，来到诊所的那扇凄凉的大门前时，她转过身望着他——这时他突然意识到她的问题已成了他们俩要终生共同面对的问题。





第十章


九月，戴弗医生和芭比·沃伦在苏黎世一起喝茶。

“我觉得这样做不妥当，”芭比·沃伦说，“你的意图我不知道自己是不是真的能理解。”

“你只要不阻挠就行。”

“可我毕竟是尼科尔的姐姐呀。”

“你不能因此就有权加以干涉。”迪克心里升腾起一把无名之火，心里有话，但不知道怎么说才好了，“尼科尔有钱，可是这不意味着我是贪她的钱而来的。”

“尼科尔的确很有钱，问题就在于此。”芭比不依不饶，说话的口气仍很硬。

“那你说她到底有多少钱？”他问道。

这一问算是将了芭比一军。迪克暗自发笑，继续说道：“跟你谈这件事你看是不是有点冒傻气？我最好还是和你们家哪位拿事的男士谈一谈……”

“这件事我完全可以做主。”她说话的口气仍旧很硬，“我们并不是觉得你是图钱而来，而是不了解你。”

“我是一名医生，”他说，“家父是牧师，现已退休。我们家住在布法罗，对于我的过去你们可以去调查嘛。我在纽黑文上过学，后来获得了罗兹奖学金。我的曾祖父做过北卡罗来纳州州长，我是疯狂的安东尼·韦恩[32]的直系后代。”

“谁是疯狂的安东尼·韦恩？”芭比一脸茫然地问。

“你不知道疯狂的安东尼·韦恩？”

“依我看，你们俩的这件事已经够疯狂的了。”

他无奈地摇了摇头。这时，尼科尔出现在旅馆的平台上，东张西望地在寻找他们。

“他的确很疯狂，像马歇尔·菲尔德[33]一样把许多钱都捐了出去。”他说。

“那倒是挺不错……”

芭比这般挑剔其实并没有错，她心里是很清楚的。如果比身份，她父亲可以说比任何一个牧师都要强。他们家是一个没有爵号的贵族世家——这个家族的名字写在旅馆的登记簿上，签在介绍信上，遇到尴尬的情况，可以引起人们的心理变化，而这种心理的变化曾经影响过她，使她意识到了自己的社会地位是多么显赫。她是从英国人那里知道这一点的——那些英国人熟知他们家族两百多年的历史。她所不知道的是：迪克有两次都差点跟她翻脸，放弃这桩婚姻。幸亏这时尼科尔发现了他们坐的地方，飘然走了过来，在八月份的这个下午她显得是那么清新艳丽，满脸熠熠生彩。

以下是尼科尔婚前及婚后的一段经历和臆想：

你好，律师！明天我们要去科莫一个星期，然后返回苏黎世。我想让你和我姐姐把这件事定下来，至于我能得多少无关紧要。我们将在苏黎世安安静静住两年，迪克的钱完全够用的。不，芭比，我比你想象的要实际——我需要钱只是买买衣服什么的……啊，怎么会有那么多钱！家里真能给我那么多钱？这恐怕叫我花都花不完。难道你也有那么多钱？……你怎么比我的还多？是不是因为我是个病人？好吧，就让我那一份堆在那儿吧……不行的，迪克拒绝同这笔钱有任何牵连。我为我们俩感到自豪……芭比，你对迪克的为人是不太了解……哦，让我在哪儿签字？哦，真抱歉。

……两人世界真是有趣又冷清，迪克。你我相厮相守，哪儿都不去，只要有爱就够了。若说爱，我爱得最深，你离开我，哪怕是一小会儿，我都受不了。能像其他人一样生活，一伸手就能摸到你睡在我身旁，暖乎乎的，这感觉真好。

……麻烦你给医院挂电话，叫我丈夫来接！……是的，这本小书到处都在卖——他们要用六种语言出版。我倒是可以把它翻译成法语，但这些日子我感到疲倦，身子又重又笨，老怕摔倒，就像个站都站不直的破不倒翁。冰凉的听诊器压在我的胸口上，我只有一个感觉：“我什么都不怕！”……唉，医院里那个母亲真可怜，抱着个皮肤发青的婴儿[34]，真是生不如死呀。咱们现在成了三口之家，你说好不好？

……岂有此理，迪克！再怎么说咱们也得住大一些的房子。难道就因为沃伦家的钱比戴弗家的多，咱们就得委屈自己不成？……哦，谢谢你，侍者，不过，我们改主意了。这位英国牧师对我们说，你们奥维多[35]产的葡萄酒味道很好。知名度不高？怪不得连我们这些爱酒人士都没有听说过。

湖泊嵌在褐色的土地上，一道道山坡此起彼伏，像是肚皮上的褶皱。摄影师把我的照片给了我们——在前往卡布里岛[36]的轮船上，我站在栏杆边，头发披散下来。一个船员在唱：“再见，蓝色的格罗特[37]！不久我们还会再来相会。”后来，轮船沿着靴状的意大利国那炎热、险恶的腰部航行，风儿掠过那怪异的城堡，呼呼地叫着，而山上的亡灵在向下俯瞰。

这艘轮船很棒，我们高兴得用脚后跟磕打甲板。这是一处临风的拐角，每次我们走过这里，我总要被风刮得身子倾斜，于是我就裹紧衣服，一步不落地跟着迪克。我们由着性子胡唱：

喔—喔—喔—喔

火烈鸟跟我无缘，

喔—喔—喔—喔

火烈鸟跟我无缘……

同迪克在一起，生活充满了乐趣……在甲板上，人们坐在椅子上盯着我们看；一位女士竖起耳朵，想听我们在唱什么歌。迪克唱烦了……那好吧，你就自己走吧，迪克。你自己走，独自一人穿过那堆椅子黑压压的影子，穿过那烟囱里冒出的黑烟，你会有不同的感觉，会觉得气氛沉重。你会觉得那一双双眼睛在斜睨着你。你不再是与世隔绝的孤家寡人啦？我认为应该先融入生活，再从生活中超脱才对！

坐在救生艇的立柱上，我眺望大海，头发随风飘扬，闪着亮光。在蓝天之下，我一动不动，乘坐着我的小船驶向未来，驶向那蔚蓝色的远方。我仿佛就是希腊女神帕拉斯·雅典娜，人们怀着敬意将我的像镌刻在船头上。辽阔的大海上涛声滚滚，玛瑙绿的浪花翻卷着，在船尾发出一声声的叹息。

那年，我们到处旅行，去过伍卢穆卢湾[38]，也去过比斯克拉[39]。在撒哈拉沙漠的边上，我们遇上了蝗灾，可司机轻描淡写地说那只不过是大黄蜂。入夜，星空低垂，那儿似乎处处都有不知名的神在注视着我们。啊，那个光着身子的奥莱德奈尔[40]小孩真可怜。夜空里回荡着各种声响，有塞内加尔[41]的鼓声、笛声和骆驼的哀号声，还有土著人穿着用旧轮胎做成的鞋子啪嗒啪嗒走动的声音。

但那个时候，我已怀上了第二胎，迷恋于火车和海滩，因而他就带我四处旅行。不过，我的第二个孩子，小女儿托普西出生后，我的心境又变得阴郁起来。

……要是有人给我丈夫捎个口信就好了。谁料想他竟然把我一个人丢在此处，交给一些无能的家伙看管！你说我生下的是个黑孩子——太可笑了，简直是无稽之谈！我们到非洲的目的只是想参观参观提姆加德[42]，因为我生活中的主要兴趣是考古。我讨厌无知，讨厌人们老说我什么也不懂。

……待我身体好起来，我要做一个像你这样的有用人才，迪克——要是不太迟的话，我想学医。咱们必须动用我的钱，购置一套住房——我不愿再住公寓了，不愿在公寓里眼巴巴地等着你回来。再说，你在苏黎世也待够了，因为你在这儿没有时间写书。你说过，一个科学家不著书立说就是怯懦的表现。我也要在知识领域上下求索，了解和掌握知识，这样，万一我身体再次崩溃，就能够以知识作为精神的支柱。你可要帮助我，迪克，让我无愧于自己的人生。咱们可以定居于温暖宜人的海滩附近，把皮肤晒成古铜色，焕发出青春的活力。

……这儿将成为迪克的工作室。哦，我俩不约而同地想到一块儿了。我们从塔姆斯路过，来来回回有十几次了，偶然跑到这里来，结果发现了这些空房子，还有两间马厩。我们找了个法国人做中介买下了它们，谁知法国海军得知美国人买下了这个山村的几间房屋，就立刻派人来调查，对这儿进行彻底搜查，看有没有藏着武器。最后还是芭比跑到巴黎的外交部找关系，才算为我们了结了这件事。

夏天没有人来里维埃拉，于是我们就盼着人来，盼着有点事做。这儿稀稀拉拉来了几个法国人……上个星期，米斯廷盖来到这里，他发现旅馆竟然开门营业了，感到十分惊讶……另外，我们还看到了毕加索和《禁止接吻》的那个作者[43]。

……迪克，你登记时为什么用戴弗先生和戴弗太太，而不用戴弗医生和戴弗夫人？我只是有些好奇……这只是偶然产生的想法……你教导我，说工作就是一切，而我相信你说得对。你常说：一个人要不断学习，一旦止步不前，就会流于平庸——学则进，不学则退。如果你忽东忽西，也行，莫非要你的尼科尔也亦步亦趋跟你学，亲爱的？

……汤米说我寡言少语。自从我病好之后，我这还是第一次跟迪克彻夜长谈。我俩坐在床上，点着烟抽，蓝蓝的曙光照进来时，我们就把枕头盖在脸上，不让光线直射眼睛。有的时候，我唱唱歌，跟猫狗玩耍，还交了几个朋友——玛丽就是其中的一个。我跟玛丽交谈，都是自顾自地说，谁都不听谁的。说话是男人的事。我要是说话，就跟自己说，仿佛我成了迪克。我甚至还觉得自己成了我的儿子，想象着他是多么聪明，又是多么迟钝。有时，我又觉得自己成了多姆勒医生，甚至有一次觉得自己变成了汤米·巴尔班。汤米大概爱上了我，不过他爱得温文尔雅、脉脉含情。这样一来，迪克和他之间就有了嫌隙。总而言之，现在的状况比以往任何时候都好。周围的朋友们都很喜欢我；我和我丈夫及两个孩子在这静谧的海滨享受着天伦之乐。要是我能把这该死的制作马里兰鸡的食谱译成法文的话，那就事事顺心了。脚丫子踩在沙滩上暖丝丝的，感觉真好！

好的，让我看看。又新来了一些人……哦，那个女孩……是的。你说她看上去像谁来着……不，我没看过——这地方能看美国新影片的机会是不多的。罗斯玛丽是谁？噢，七月份咱们这儿一下子变得非常时尚起来了——这在我看来非常奇怪。是的，她很可爱，但是来这儿的人未免也太多了。





第十一章


八月份的一天，理查德·戴弗先生和埃尔西·斯皮尔斯夫人来到艾利斯露天咖啡馆，坐在落满了灰尘的大树遮出的阴凉中聊天。烈日炙烤着大地，明晃晃的，使得云母石桌面显得黯然失色。岸边刮起一股西北风，横扫埃斯泰雷勒[44]，刮得海港里的渔船左右摇晃——但见桅杆如林，直指寂寥的天空。

“今天上午我收到一封信。”斯皮尔斯夫人说道，“都是那些黑人惹的事，让你们全都陷入了可怕的境地！但罗斯玛丽夸你哩，说你对她可好啦。”

“倒是罗斯玛丽应该受到嘉奖。那件事真够呛……唯一不受影响的人是阿贝·诺思，因为他飞到勒阿弗尔[45]去了——也许他还不知道出事了呢。”

“戴弗夫人为此感到沮丧，这叫我为她难过。”她谨慎地说。

（她上午收到的是罗斯玛丽的信，信中说：“尼科尔看来脑子出了毛病。我不想同他们去南方了，因为我觉得迪克要操心的事够多了。”）

“她现在好了。”迪克有些不耐烦地说，“这么说你明天要走了。什么时候动身？”

“很快。”

“天哪！你们一走，真让人舍不得。”

“我们很庆幸来到了这里，多亏有你，度过了一段愉快的时光。你可是第一个能叫罗斯玛丽真正放在心上的男人。”

又有一股风从拉纳普尔[46]的斑岩丘陵那儿刮来。空气中有一种气息——天气将会发生剧烈变化，繁花似锦、适宜外出的仲夏已经结束。

“罗斯玛丽不乏白马王子，或迟或早都会逐一交给了我剖析。”斯皮尔斯夫人笑道。

“我不包括在内吧？”

“对于你俩，我就是想剖析也剖析不成，因为在我见到你之前她就深深爱上了你。我要她继续向前走。”

他看得出，斯皮尔斯夫人计划“剖析”的人当中的确没有他，也没有尼科尔。他还看得出，她之所以有这种不道德的举动，是闲得无聊所致。这是她的权利——她自己退出了风月场，这也算一种弥补吧。女性为了生存下去苦苦挣扎，不能将这种举动跟男性所犯下的“暴行”相提并论。只要爱情与痛苦在适当的范围内进行，斯皮尔斯夫人都会以超然的态度、浓厚的兴趣作壁上观，俨然一个与情欲无缘的太监。至于罗斯玛丽会不会受到伤害，她甚至连想都不想……要不然，她是心中有数，知道罗斯玛丽不会受到伤害？

“要是你说的是真的，我觉得对她也没有什么害处。”他仍然装出一副不动感情、能够客观看待罗斯玛丽的样子，“反正她的这种感情已经过去了。人生的许多事情都是这样——来如流水逝如风。”“其实并非如此，”斯皮尔斯夫人仍坚持自己的观点，“你是第一个叫她动情的男人，是她的偶像。她每封信上都这么说。”

“她是在说客气话。”

“你和罗斯玛丽是我见识过的最客气的人，但这件事上她可是真情实意。”

“我的客气则是口是心非。”

这倒是实话。从他父亲身上，他学到了内战后来到北方的年轻南方人的那种故作有风度的伎俩。他时常施展这种伎俩，又时常鄙视它们，因为这种作态不是对内心自私心理的谴责，而是在粉饰自己，使自己看上去不自私。

“我爱上罗斯玛丽了。”想到这里，他冷不丁地对她说，“对你敞开心扉，算是一种自我释放吧。”

此刻道出真情显得十分怪异，也显得十分正规——仿佛他要艾利斯咖啡馆的每张桌子、每把椅子都永远记住这一时刻似的。他觉得她已经消失在了云雾之中，只能记得她在沙滩上被太阳晒红了的肩膀了；记得穿过塔姆斯的花园时，她在前边走，而他跟在后边一步一步踩碎了她留下的足印。此刻，乐队奏起了《尼斯狂欢曲》，听上去像是去年那段逝去的欢乐时光的回声，人们翩翩起舞，而她似乎是中心人物。她似乎掌握着天下最神奇的魔术，具有通天的本事，穿过漫长的岁月姗姗而至，叫你目眩，叫你兴奋，叫你有一种和谐的心境。

他定定神，又恢复了理智，换上了斯皮尔斯夫人的那种超然态度，说道：“你和罗斯玛丽有着本质区别。她固然有你的智慧——这种智慧融入了她体内，使得她能够理智地面对这个世界。不过，她不属于深思熟虑型，因为她的一颗心是爱尔兰式的，是浪漫的，是非逻辑性的。”

斯皮尔斯夫人也知道，尽管罗斯玛丽花容月貌，但其实是一匹小野马（美国陆军上尉军医霍伊特就是这么看的）。如果进行解剖，你就会发现她那娇小的躯壳里实际上具有硕大的心脏、肝脏及灵魂。

分手时，迪克意识到埃尔西·斯皮尔斯夫人是个极其有城府的人，不仅使他想起了罗斯玛丽，勾起了他的难舍之情，恐怕还另有深意……对于罗斯玛丽，他也许可以做出弥补，但别指望对她的母亲做出弥补。如果说他赠给罗斯玛丽裘皮大衣、珍珠玛瑙算是一种弥补，那么对她的母亲则不行——她的母亲神态安然，可能觉得他与其这样，还不如别惹出这段情缘。她的神态像是在等待，等待他经过心理搏斗后对一件事情做出决断（这件事比她的生命还重要，像是一场斗争或是一场手术），既不催他也不逼他。他完成了这段心理历程后，她仍会耐心等待，不急不躁，坐在高脚凳上，翻阅着报纸。

“再见！希望你们俩别忘了，我和尼科尔非常爱你们。”他对埃尔西·斯皮尔斯夫人说道。

回到黛安娜别墅，他走进自己的工作间，打开那为遮挡正午阳光而关上的百叶窗。在两张长桌上，整齐地堆放着他写书用的材料。他的专著的第一卷讲的是精神病学的分类，已经由政府补贴出版，获得了小小的成功。现正在洽谈再版事宜。第二卷是对他的处女作《精神病医生的心理学》的大幅度扩展。跟许多作者一样，他发现的学术观点很单一，只有那么一两种——那本已经印了五十版的薄薄的德语版论文集囊括了他所有的思想精华。

此时，他坐立不安，感到有点着急。回想起在纽黑文虚度的年月，他不禁扼腕长叹。最叫他觉得忐忑的是，他和尼科尔把日子过得越来越奢华，越来越铺张，越来越讲究场面。想起那位罗马尼亚朋友讲的故事，想起故事中那位花了数年时间研究犰狳大脑的人，他不由浮想联翩，想象着那些极有耐心的德国人跑到柏林和维也纳的图书馆附近，焦急地等待着一睹他的新作。他踌躇不决，想把现成的章节浓缩成十万字作为导论先出版，以后再跟进出版学术性强的卷本。

午后的阳光洒满整个屋子，他一边踱步，一边再三斟酌。如果按照这一计划进行，春天就可以完稿。他觉得，一个精力充沛的人如果对某个计划疑窦丛生，一年了也拿不定主意，那就说明此计划本身有缺陷。

他拿过一块用作镇纸的镀过金的金属条压在稿纸上，然后开始清理房间（他是不允许仆人进这个房间的），草草地用“良友”牌清洁剂洗刷了厕所，修整了一下窗纱。接下来，他给苏黎世的一家出版社寄了份订书单，随即斟了杯杜松子酒喝，里面加了多一倍的水。

他看见尼科尔在花园里，想到马上就要面对她，不由得心里一沉。在她面前，他必须保持一个完美的形象，现在如此，明天如此，下星期如此，明年亦然。在巴黎，他整夜搂着她——尽管服了镇静剂，她仍睡得很不安稳。次日清晨，她一旦出现惶恐不安的迹象，他就以温柔的话语安慰她，让她重新进入梦乡，而他紧偎着她，嗅着她头发里散发出的温热的香气。她起床之前，他就到隔壁房间打电话安排好了一切——罗斯玛丽将搬到另一家旅馆去住。罗斯玛丽也决意要做《父女情深》里的那种女性，甚至没跟他们告别就走了。旅馆老板麦克贝斯先生对他们的事情睁一只眼闭一只眼，不闻也不问。他和尼科尔打点行装，把一盒盒、一包包买来的东西堆放在一起，准备中午到里维埃拉去。

他们对罗斯玛丽的反应是在途中发生的。夫妇二人在火车包厢里安顿下来后，迪克看了看尼科尔，知道她在等待着他说些什么。未待火车驶出车站，这种反应就出现了，简直迅雷不及掩耳——他本能地想跳下仍在慢慢蠕动的火车跑回去找罗斯玛丽，看看她在哪里，在干什么。他感觉尼科尔在车厢对面靠在枕头上观察着他，于是便戴上夹鼻眼镜，打开书准备看书。由于根本无心看书，他就装作累了，合上了眼睛，而尼科尔仍在观察他。她服了药，晕乎乎的，但心里的一块石头落了地，甚至感到很高兴，因为他又是她的了。

他闭上眼睛，情况变得更糟糕了——“得”与“失”这两个字眼反复在他的脑海中出现，它们有节奏地跳动着。为了不暴露自己焦躁的情绪，他索性合眼躺在那儿不动，一直躺到中午时分。午餐时，情况有所好转——他们每餐必吃美味佳肴（在旅馆、饭馆、火车包厢、自助餐厅和飞机上，他们吃了不知有多少顿，要是合在一起，那真是酒池肉林呀）。餐车里的侍者跑前跑后，为他们送来了小瓶葡萄酒和矿泉水，巴黎、里昂和地中海的山珍海味无比可口——这些使他们产生了一种幻觉，以为一切如常。可是，唯有这次旅行，二人之间出现了裂痕——他们似乎不是在奔向幸福，而是在走向分离。一瓶酒，尼科尔只喝了一杯，其余的全让迪克灌下了肚。吃饭时，他们谈到了他们的家，谈到了他们的孩子。可是一回到包厢里，他们就谁都不说话了（他们有一次在卢森堡广场对面的餐馆里用餐，曾经出现过这样的局面）。刚刚摆脱了不快的局面，难道又要走回头路，再次陷入尴尬不成？迪克感到一阵莫名的烦躁。就在这时，只听尼科尔突然说道：“就这样离开罗斯玛丽似乎不太妥当……你看她不会有什么事吧？”

“当然不会有事的。她是完全可以照顾好自己的……”迪克说到这里，又怕尼科尔产生误会，以为在蔑视她的能力，于是赶忙补充道：“她毕竟是个演员嘛，即便有母亲当保护伞，也得处处小心。”

“她很迷人。”

“她只不过是个孩子。”

“她确实很有魅力。”

他们漫无边际地随便聊着，但说出的都是对方心里的话。

“她并不像我想象的那样聪明。”迪克说道。

“她是相当机灵的。”

“其实并不怎么样……她稚气未退，老是有那么一种不成熟的味道。”

“她的容貌还是相当不错的。”尼科尔语气冷淡，却非常坚定，“就拍电影来说，她的形象恐怕是非常棒的。”

“她受过良好的训练，但总体来说有点缺乏个性。”

“我觉得她很有个性。看得出她对男人们非常有吸引力。”

他的心揪紧了。什么男人？有多少？他耳边又回响起了罗斯玛丽和那个小伙子的对话：

“我放下窗帘，你不介意吧？”

“放下来吧。这儿也太亮了。”

罗斯玛丽此时此刻在哪里？和谁在一起？

“过不了几年，她就会看上去比你还老上十岁。”

“正相反。一天晚上去看戏，我在节目单上给她画了张速写——看着她，我觉得她是不会老的。”

这天夜里，他们俩辗转反侧，都没有睡好。在随后的一两天里，迪克竭力想驱散罗斯玛丽的幽灵，唯恐它会影响他们的生活，但只恨力所不及。有的时候，人会觉得欢乐易逝，痛苦难除。对于罗斯玛丽，他欲忘不能，实在无计可施，只好将这一番心思放在肚子里。雪上加霜的是，过了这许多年，尼科尔应该能辨别精神病发作的征兆，可她不加防范，这叫他有些气恼。在不到两个星期的时间里，她连着发作了两次。一次是在塔姆斯举行聚会的那个晚上，他发现她在卧室里狂笑，对米基思科夫人说她进不了盥洗室，因为她把钥匙扔进下水道了。米基思科夫人极为震惊，既生气又不知如何是好，但也有所悟。那次迪克倒并不十分担忧，因为尼科尔事后很后悔，打电话到高斯旅馆去道歉，但米基思科夫妇已经走了。

另一次发作是在巴黎，比第一次要严重，预示着可能会有新的一轮发作出现，病情将会进一步恶化。尼科尔生下托普西后，长期存在病情反复的现象，这让迪克苦不堪言，他只好打起精神面对两个不同的尼科尔——一个是病态的，另一个是正常的。现在他都难以区分自己的两种心态了——一种是自我保护性的职业上的超然，另一种是新近才有的冷漠。由于冷漠的产生，或者说由于激情的消退，他的心空了，最后也就没有尼科尔了——他服侍她，完全是违心的，是不情愿的，在感情上是淡漠的。一个作家在书里写道：皮肤上的伤口愈合了，基本也就消失了，但一个人心里的伤口却另当别论——心里一旦有了伤口，即便缩小到针眼那么大，也还依然存在。心里的伤痕，恐怕比失去一根手指或瞎掉一只眼睛留下的伤痕还要深。我们往往可能会忽略这样的伤痕，可是一旦注意到，就后悔莫及了。





第十二章


他来到花园里，尼科尔双手抱肩，一双灰色的眼睛直直望着他，目光里有孩子般的好奇。

“我到戛纳去了一趟，”他说，“结果遇到了斯皮尔斯夫人。她明天就要走了，想来这儿跟你道别，但我打消了她的这个念头。”

“很遗憾。我倒想见见她，因为我喜欢她。”

“你猜我还见到谁啦？巴塞洛缪·泰勒！”

“不会吧？”

“那个狡猾的老狐狸！他的那张脸我是不会认错的！他在为西罗的动物展览寻找地方——他们明年会过来的。我怀疑艾布拉姆斯夫人是来打前站的。”

“那年夏天咱们初到这里，芭比见到他都快气疯了……”

“他们好像并不在乎在哪儿办展览，只知道满世界瞎跑。真希望他们待在多维尔[47]，哪里也别去。”

“是不是需要吓唬吓唬他们，就说这儿在闹霍乱什么的？”

“我吓唬过了巴塞洛缪，说这儿的动物跟苍蝇一样成批死亡，说婴儿就如同战场上的机枪手一般短命。”

“你不会这么说的。”

“是的，我没这么说。”他承认道，“他可是一团和气。我们俩站在大街上握手的场面十分壮观，跟西格蒙德·弗洛伊德和沃德·麦卡利斯特[48]相会时的情景有一拼。”

迪克并不想说话，只想一个人待着，考虑考虑工作和未来，忘掉爱情的烦恼以及眼前的尴尬。尼科尔隐约有所察觉，感到有点悲伤，甚至有些恨他，可是又想依偎在他的肩膀上。

“亲爱的，咱们进去吧。”迪克淡淡地说。

他进了屋子，却忘了进屋要干什么，定了定神才想起要弹钢琴，于是便吹着口哨坐下来，不用乐谱，弹奏起来：

想一想你坐在我膝上，

二人把佳茗品尝，

没有别人在身旁，

只有你我把佳茗品尝……

弹着弹着，他突然意识到尼科尔听了会起疑心，立刻会联想到他这两个星期对罗斯玛丽缠绵的情思，于是最后又随手胡乱弹了一个和弦，便离开了钢琴。

他真不知道上哪儿去好。他四周看了看——这幢房子是用尼科尔祖父的钱买的，是尼科尔一手布置的，他只拥有他的工作间和工作间所占的地皮。他有三千块钱的年薪和一些零星的稿酬，用这些钱来置办他的衣服和支付其他个人的消费，支付家里的酒钱以及拉尼尔的教育费（目前，这笔“教育费”仅局限于保姆的工资）。在衣食住行方面，考虑到自己应承担的这部分费用，他精打细算，简直像个苦行僧一样，一个人出门只坐三等车厢，喝最便宜的酒，十分爱惜自己的衣服，对自己任何铺张浪费的行为都要自我惩戒，这样才能保持经济上的独立。超出一定的范围，他就会感到捉襟见肘……不知有多少次，他都想跟尼科尔谈谈，看怎样用尼科尔的钱才合适。当然，尼科尔渴望拥有他，想让他永远保持对她的爱，他稍有懈怠，她就用金钱刺激——一次又一次，源源不断的物质享受和金钱左右了他，改造了他。那天他突发奇想，想在悬崖边建别墅就是一例——金钱的力量使他偏离了最初在苏黎世的那种生活从简的原则。

过去他常说：“那会很有趣的，如果……”现在他这样说：“那会很有趣的，当……”

其实，他的生活并没有多少乐趣——尼科尔麻烦不断，严重干扰了他的工作；其次，尼科尔的收益近来增长很快，相比较之下，他的工作显得微不足道。还有，为了治愈她的病，多年来他虽然也有偏离的时候，但表面上一直保持着顾家好男人的形象，但如今，要想不费劲儿就能够保持这种伪装就比较困难了，因为他势必会受到细腻的审视。如果他想弹自己喜欢的曲子都弹不成，那就证明他的生活已受到了严重限制。他带着这种心思在大房间里逗留了很久，聆听着电钟嘀嗒嘀嗒的声音，聆听着时间的流逝。

十一月，海水的颜色变深了，浪头冲上堤岸，漫到岸边的公路上——残存下来的夏季生活的气息被冲刷得干干净净，凄风苦雨使得海滩显得荒芜凄凉。高斯旅馆因整修和扩建关门歇业，而瑞昂莱潘夏季娱乐场的楼房则越发显得高大，气势逼人。迪克和尼科尔不是流连于戛纳，就是逗留于尼斯，有了新的朋友圈，其中包括管弦乐队队员、饭店老板、园艺爱好者、游艇爱好者（迪克买了一艘旧游艇），以及旅游协会的会员。对于家里的仆人，他们很放心；关于孩子们的教育，他们做了认真的思考。到十二月，尼科尔似乎又恢复了正常，一个月过去了，不见她情绪紧张，不见她嘴角紧绷，不见她莫名其妙地傻笑，也听不到她语无伦次的话语。于是，他们就在圣诞假期跑到瑞士攀登阿尔卑斯山了。





第十三章


进屋前，迪克先用帽子掸去了深蓝色滑雪服上的雪花。大厅的地板上密密麻麻有许多斑痕，那是二十年来被人们的鞋钉踩出来的。为了举办茶话会和舞会，这儿打扫得干干净净。八十几个格施塔德[49]附近寄宿学校里的美国小青年来到这里，有的随着《别带鲁鲁来》的欢乐曲子瞎蹦乱跳，有的则跟着查尔斯顿打击乐[50]的节奏狂喊胡吼。这儿是年轻人的乐园，气氛质朴、热闹——那些爱摆阔气的富人则集中在圣莫里茨[51]。芭比·沃伦来到这儿跟戴弗夫妇相会，心里觉得很委屈、很掉价。

大厅布置得很雅致，被嘈杂声震得微微发颤。迪克一眼就看到了那姊妹俩——她们穿着滑雪服，尼科尔的是天蓝色，芭比的是红褐色，看上去真像招贴画上的人物，十分亮眼。一个年轻的英国人正同她们说话，但她们心不在焉，只顾盯着那些跳舞的小青年们瞧。

尼科尔看见迪克过来，被风雪吹打过后发红的脸顿时一亮，越发显得神采奕奕。

“他在哪儿？”

“他没赶上这班火车——稍晚我去接他。”迪克坐下来，跷起二郎腿，将搁在膝上的那只穿着笨重靴子的脚晃来晃去，“你们俩站在一起十分引人注目。有时候我都忘了咱们是一家人，看见你们美艳如花很是吃惊。”

芭比身材高挑，姿容俏丽，但毕竟已近三十岁，脸上难免会显出岁月的痕迹。她从伦敦拉了两个男子来做伴——一个是来自剑桥大学，似乎还没有毕业；另一个年龄大些，身上有一股维多利亚时代的那种放纵的习气。芭比有着老处女的一些特征——她不习惯被人触摸，要是有人突然碰她一下，她会惊跳起来；像亲吻和拥抱这类缠绵的接触，会通过皮肉直接传导到她的大脑皮层——她的身体很少做出恰当的反应（遇到这种情景，她只会跺脚和摇头，显得迂腐、老派）。朋友们遇到灾难，受到死亡的威胁，总会成为她津津乐道的话题——她坚持认为尼科尔的悲剧是她的命。

滑雪时，芭比带来的那个年纪较轻的英国小伙子围着她们姊妹俩打转，陪她们在平缓的雪道上滑，在她们的眼前晃来晃去。迪克在做屈膝旋转的危险动作时扭了脚踝，只好跟孩子们一起在“儿童滑雪道”上溜达，或者回旅馆跟一位俄国医生一起喝淡啤酒。

“高兴些，迪克，”尼科尔鼓励他说，“你为什么不去见见那些小妞，下午跟她们跳跳舞？”

“我跟她们有什么可说的？”

她那低沉而稍显刺耳的声音提高了几度，弄出一副哀伤、卖弄风情的腔调来，说道：“你就说，‘小妞，你们当中谁最漂亮？’你觉得说什么好呢？”

“我不喜欢小妞，她们闻起来有股橄榄油皂和薄荷的味道。跟她们一起跳舞，我觉得我像是在推一辆童车。”

这是一个危险的话题——他意识到了这一点，于是便提高了警惕，对那些少女视而不见，而是将目光投向了她们头顶的上空。

“真是事乱如麻呀。”芭比说，“首先，家里来信说：咱们称作‘火车站地皮’的那份产业，起初铁路部门只买下了它的中心部分，现在悉数全买下来了。那份产业是属于母亲的。现在面临着一个如何投资的问题。”

那个英国小伙子假装对谈话转向俗气的内容不感兴趣，便向舞池中的一个女孩子走了过去。芭比是美国女子，但历来都只崇拜英国人，此时恋恋不舍地目送着他，最后才又不屑地继续说了下去：“这是一大笔钱，每人有三十万。我可以招呼好我的钱，把它用于证券投资，而尼科尔对此却一窍不通。你大概也不懂吧？”

“我得去车站接人了。”迪克答非所问地说。

出了门，他深深吸了口气，把湿湿的雪花也吸进了嘴里（天色黑了下来，已看不见那飘舞的雪花了）。这时，有三个小孩用某种外语大声喊叫着让他当心，踩着滑雪板从他身边飞驰而过。他们滑到前边的转弯处，他仍可以听见他们的叫喊声，还可以听见远处黑暗中爬坡的雪橇那清脆的铃声。火车站张灯结彩，准备迎接节日的到来。站台上满是男孩子和女孩子，他们是来接新朋友的。火车到站时，迪克已适应了这种氛围。见到弗朗茨·格雷戈罗维斯，他装出一副悠闲的样子，就好像他玩得不亦乐乎，只是抽了个空来接弗朗茨。可是弗朗茨却是满腹心事，根本不理会他的这种心境。迪克曾给他写信说：“我可能在苏黎世只待一天。要不然你就去洛桑找我吧。”结果，弗朗茨一路寻找，来到了格施塔德。

弗朗茨已入不惑之年，身体健康，性格成熟，善于应酬，待人接物颇有一套，但他更喜欢诊所里的那种封闭、安静的环境——在那里，他可以用鄙视的态度对精神崩溃的富人进行“再教育”。他的科学禀赋也许可以将他引入一个更宽广的世界，但他似乎有意选择比较低下的职位作为立足点，在择偶方面也有这种倾向。来到旅馆后，芭比·沃伦迅速打量了他几眼，没发现他有什么值得尊敬的地方，也没发现他具有上流社会所认可的那种温文尔雅的举止和彬彬有礼的态度，于是就把他当作二等公民对待了。尼科尔总有点怕他，而迪克喜欢他——迪克对朋友一视同仁，都非常喜欢。

傍晚时分，他们坐雪橇从山上滑到村子里（这种小雪橇所起的作用如同威尼斯的那种小划船）。他们的目的地是一家别致的旅馆——那儿有老式的瑞士酒吧，木头结构，有嗡嗡的回声，房间里有挂钟、啤酒桶和鹿角。在旅馆里，一群群人坐在长条桌旁，乍看还以为是一场盛大的聚会呢，吃着威尔士干酪（一种不易消化的奶酪），喝着加了香料的热酒。

大厅里洋溢着欢快的气氛——这是那个英国小伙子的评价，迪克也认为如此。此时的迪克由于喝了烈性酒感到有点飘飘然，仿佛回到了十九世纪九十年代的黄金时期——头发灰白的老人一边弹钢琴一边高声唱着欢快的歌；大厅里烟雾缭绕，可闻青春的声音，可见色彩明艳的服装。有一刻，他觉得他们是在大海上航行，陆地就在眼前。所有女孩子的脸上都有一种期待的神情，那样天真，那样憧憬（在大海上航行以及在黑夜里摸索，她们总会有这样的表情）。他仔细望了望，想看看那个独特的女孩子是否也在其中，她好像坐在那些人背后的桌子旁……不过，一转眼他就把她忘了，随口说了一通有趣的话，想让同伴们听了乐一乐。

“我得跟你谈谈，”弗朗茨用英语说道，“我在这儿只能待二十四个小时。”

“我就猜到你心里有事。”

“我有个计划……一个非常棒的计划。”他把手放在了迪克的膝头上，“我这个计划可以让咱们俩都大展宏图。”

“是吗？”

“迪克……有一家诊所，咱们俩可以合伙经营……就是楚格湖区的那家历史悠久的布朗诊所。除了某些方面，那家诊所的设施都很先进。布朗病了……他想去奥地利，在那儿度过余生，这可是一个千载难逢的好机会。你和我……那可是黄金搭档！你先别开口，等我把话说完。”

迪克见芭比眼睛发亮，就知道她也在听。

“你我必须联手把那家诊所接过来。这非但不会过多地束缚你的手脚，还可以给你提供一个工作基地、一个实验室、一个研究中心。气候条件好的时候，你可以住在诊所，就说住上他个小半年吧。冬天，你可以去法国或美国，利用诊所的临床经验给你的著述补充新的材料。”说到这里，他压低了声音，“这样也有助于你妻子的康复，因为那儿毕竟是诊所，环境好，设施好。”他见迪克神情不悦，便咂了咂嘴，很快转了话题，“咱俩联手，我负责业务管理，你负责理论指导，为病人提供咨询什么的。我有自知之明——我知道自己没有天赋，而你有。不过，在某些方面，大家还是认为我非常能干的——我精通于最现代的诊所管理方法。实际上，我已经在管理那家诊所了，有时一连几个月都是我在运作。教授说这个计划很好，鼓励我做下去。他说他将长命百岁，一直干到生命的最后一刻。”

迪克在下结论前，先对未来的前景做了一番思考。

“钱从哪儿来？”他问道。

弗朗茨动动下巴，扬扬眉毛，蹙蹙额头，双手、胳膊肘以及肩头抖了抖，绷紧大腿的肌肉（紧得连裤腿都鼓了起来），一颗心能提到嗓子眼里，接着才从嘴里吐出了几句话。

“难就难在这里！钱！”他沮丧地说，“我没有什么钱。盘下诊所需要二十万美元。至于翻新改造……”他犹疑不决地斟酌着自己的话，“这些需要两万美元，但这你也知道是很有必要的。不过，那个诊所可是座金矿——告诉你吧，他们的账簿我可是看过的。只要投资二十万美元，就可以稳赚不赔……”

芭比十分好奇，于是迪克把她也拉到了谈话中。

只听迪克说道：“依你的经验看，芭比，一个欧洲人急于要见一个美国人，是不是势必跟钱有关？”

“此话怎讲？”她故作不知地问。

“这位年轻的兼职教授认为：我们俩应该干一件大生意，把神经崩溃的美国人吸引过来疗养治病。”

弗朗茨不无忧虑地盯着芭比，而迪克又接着说了下去：“咱俩算哪路神仙，弗朗茨？仅仅因为你有一个伟大的姓氏，我写过两本教科书，咱俩就了不起了，能把病人吸引来吗？我可没有那么多钱，就是十分之一也凑不够。”弗朗茨苦笑了一下。“老实说，我没有钱。尼科尔和芭比倒是有钱，富得堪比克罗伊斯[52]，可那是她们的钱，我分文都不能动。”

这时，人人都在竖着耳朵听……迪克心里犯嘀咕，不知坐在后边桌子旁的那个女孩是否也在听。他觉得挺有趣，决定让芭比为他说话（世上就有这么一些男人，常常叫女人针对她们做不了主的事务发表看法）。芭比说话时，顿时变得像她祖父一样冷静和老成持重：“我认为你应该认真考虑这一建议，迪克。格雷戈里医生说的事情我虽然不太懂，但我觉得……”

迪克后边的那个女孩身子前倾，面容没入烟圈中变得有些朦胧，似乎弯下腰从地上捡什么东西。他瞥了一眼坐在桌子对面的尼科尔，但见她美压群芳，一副小鸟依人的样子，于是心中顿生怜爱之情，同时决心巩固和保护这种感情。

“劝你认真考虑考虑，迪克。”弗朗茨情绪激昂地说，“你要撰写有关精神病学的书，就应该有实际的临床经验。荣格、布洛伊勒[53]、弗洛伊德、福雷尔[54]和阿德勒[55]也写这方面的书，但他们无一不和精神病患者保持着接触。”

“迪克和我保持着接触呢。”尼科尔笑道，“依我看，我的精神不稳定，就够他研究的了。”

“那是两码事。”弗朗茨谨慎地说。

芭比有自己的心思——假如尼科尔住在一家诊所的跟前，那她就可以高枕无忧，不用再为尼科尔操心了。

于是她就说道：“这件事必须认真考虑考虑。”

迪克觉得她的傲慢挺有意思，但他并不买账，而是轻声款语地说：“这个决定对我关系重大，芭比。谢谢你的关心，要我买下那家诊所。”

芭比意识到自己有点多管闲事，便急忙打起了退堂鼓，说道：“当然，这是你的事，完全由你做主。”

“针对如此重大的事情做出决定非得用几个星期的时间不可。我真不知该不该和尼科尔在苏黎世那儿定居……”迪克说着把脸转向弗朗茨，看他有什么反应，“我知道苏黎世生活条件不错，有煤气站、自来水和电灯——我可是在那儿住过三年呢。”

“那你就考虑考虑再决定吧。”弗朗茨说，“我相信你会同意的……”

一百双足有五磅重的靴子咯噔咯噔向门口走去，其他的人也跟着向外走。门外，月光清冷，迪克仿佛看见刚才坐在他身后的那个女孩正把她的小雪橇拴在前面的一辆雪橇车上。他们一行依次上了自己的雪橇，只听几声清脆的鞭响，便见马儿一鼓劲儿冲进了茫茫的夜色里。途中，不时可以看见奔跑的身影——年轻人坐在雪橇和滑车上你推我搡，被推下车的人倒在松软的雪窝里，爬起来就追，累得气喘吁吁，追上后就瘫在车上大发牢骚，责怪众人丢下他们不管。两边的田野一片静谧，雪橇队风驰电掣，行驶在一望无际的高原上。在这茫茫的冰雪世界里，万籁俱寂，大家似乎都在侧耳静听，看有没有早已销声匿迹的狼嚎。

走进萨能[56]的市政府舞厅，这儿人头攒动，有牧羊人、旅馆服务员、小店主、滑雪教练、导游，也有游客和农夫。在野外，他们有一种荒蛮、野性的泛神般的感觉，而一走进温暖、封闭的大厅，就觉得怪诞，仿佛听见骑士们在冲锋陷阵，好像马刺靴在战场上碰击坐骑，发出轰隆轰隆的声响，或者像足球鞋钉踩在更衣室水泥地上，嗵嗵作响。有人在用传统的真假嗓音互换法唱歌，熟悉的曲调使迪克心里一下子没有了刚进来时的那种浪漫情调。起初，他以为这是因为他将那个臆想中的女孩驱逐出了心房的缘故，后来才意识到全是芭比说话的那种口气所致。芭比说“这件事必须认真考虑考虑”。其潜台词就是：“我们掌控着你，你早晚都会承认的，硬充好汉，假装自己是独立之身是很荒唐的。”

多年来，迪克一直都把对他人的厌恶憋在心里——早在纽黑文上大学一年级的时候看到过一篇名为《心理卫生》的通俗文章，他就有了这种情绪。此刻，他对芭比大为恼火，讨厌她的那种冷漠、傲慢的富家女气势，但他隐而不发，强压住内心的怒火。女强人们恐怕得用几百年的时间才能真正了解男性——有些女强人口口声声说自己了解男性，可她们哪里知道男性最脆弱的就是他们的自尊心，像瓷器一样一旦破碎就无法恢复原状。这位戴弗医生的职业是为别人修复心灵，深知其中的厉害，所以唯恐自己的心灵受损。

返回格施塔德时，他们坐在平稳的雪橇上，只听他说道：“过于讲究礼节就是虚伪。”

“哦，我觉得挺好。”芭比说。

“一点都不好！”他固执地冲着身裹兽皮大衣（不知是什么野兽的皮）的芭比说道，“过于讲究礼节是一种懦弱的表现，是要别人温柔地对待你。如今，人们尊重的是……你不能随便说谁是懦夫，谁是骗子，但如果你一味迁就别人，满足他们的虚荣心，久而久之你就弄不清他们究竟哪些地方值得你尊重了。”

“我觉得美国人很在意礼节。”那位年长的英国人说。

“我猜也是这样。”迪克说，“我父亲信奉一种礼节，是从那个‘先开枪后道歉’的时代继承来的。那时美国人全副武装……而你们欧洲人自从十八世纪初就从不在日常生活中携带武器了……”

“也许是这样吧……”

“不是也许，而是真真切切地不携带武器。”

“迪克，反正你在待人接物上总是彬彬有礼。”芭比息事宁人地说。

身穿兽皮大衣的姐妹俩不无诧异地望着他。那个英国小伙子像个闷葫芦，不知道他们之间的尴尬——但他这种人善于察言观色和见风转舵。这时，在返回旅馆的路上，为了活跃气氛，他就讲了一段他和自己的挚友大打出手的往事，说他们打了有一个小时的时间，虽然他们之间有着哥们义气，出手时有所保留，但还是把对方打得鼻青脸肿（他的讲述听上去荒唐可笑）。

迪克来了幽默感，于是问道：“莫非他越打你，你对他的友谊就越深？”

“反正我更敬重他了。”

“这个道理我就不懂了。你和你的挚友为了一件小事打起来……”

“要是你不懂，我也无法解释给你听。”那个英国小伙子冷冷地说。

迪克暗忖：“只要说出心里的想法，就会碰这样的钉子！”

他有点惭愧，觉得不该难为那个小伙子——小伙子的讲述之所以听上去荒唐可笑，是因为他十分青涩，讲述时却有些作态。

他们情绪高昂，随着人流走进了烧烤室。烧烤室里，一位突尼斯籍的酒吧侍者在根据音乐的旋律调控灯光，溜冰场上的明月透过硕大的窗户朝里张望，别有一番情调。灯光下，迪克觉得臆想中的那个女孩变得精神萎靡、无精打采，于是背过身去欣赏起夜色来……灯光转成红色时，烟头便闪闪发绿，或者发出银白色的光，酒吧的门一开一关，白色的光柱扫过翩翩起舞的人群。

“请你告诉我，弗朗茨，”他开口说道，“是不是坐在这里喝上他一夜啤酒，你就可以回到诊所，让病人觉得你很有个性？你不觉得他们会把你看作酒囊饭袋吗？”

“我要去睡觉了。”尼科尔说道。

迪克陪她到了电梯口，然后说：“我就不跟你上去了。我要让弗朗茨明白，我不适合做临床医师。”

尼科尔走进了电梯。

“芭比是个很有头脑的人。”她意味深长地说。

“芭比是一个……”

电梯门砰的一声关上了，接着就是机器的运转声。

迪克刚才没把一句话说囫囵，此刻在心里把一整句话说了出来：“芭比是一个唯利是图、自私自利的女人。”

但两天后，迪克和弗朗茨一同坐雪橇去火车站时，他承认自己觉得弗朗茨的计划有可取之处。

“兜了一个大圈子，又要回到原点了。”他推心置腹地说，“按这种格调生活，难免有诸多压力，尼科尔是承受不了的。里维埃拉夏天的那种悠闲日子正在发生变化，明年会迎来社交旺季……”

雪橇驶过翠绿的草地木球场时，那儿传来悠扬的维也纳华尔兹乐曲，有许多山区学校的旗帜在淡蓝色的天空飘扬。

“我希望咱们能旗开得胜，弗朗茨。要是叫我跟别的任何一个人合作，我都不会愿意的。”

再见，格施塔德！再见，陌生的人们、冷艳的花儿、夜幕中纷飞的雪花！再见，格施塔德！再见！





第十四章


迪克做了一个长长的有关战争的梦，五点钟醒来后，走到窗前，放眼眺望窗外的楚格湖。梦开始时，场景阴森可怕，身穿海军蓝制服的士兵列队穿过漆黑一团的广场，走在前边的是军乐队，奏的是普罗科菲耶夫[57]《三个橘子的爱情》的第二乐章。接着，梦中出现了消防车（这是发生灾难的征兆），又有伤残敌军士兵在包扎所暴动的可怕场面。他打开床头灯，把梦见的情形详细记了下来，最后加了一个略带嘲讽的词语：“非战斗人员的弹震症”。

他坐在床边黯然神伤，觉得这房间，这整幢房子，连同那茫茫的黑夜都是空荡荡的。隔壁房间，尼科尔在睡梦中喃喃自语，声音凄楚，可能她在梦境里也感到孤苦，这叫他不胜惆怅。对他而言，时间有时是静止的，有时则快得像倒放电影的胶带，几年的时间会一闪而过。对尼科尔来说，岁月的消逝则是靠钟表、日历和生日计量的，随之流逝的还有她的美貌，让人感到悲哀。

即使在楚格湖这一年半的生活，对她而言也是虚度年华。这儿的生活一成不变，只有通过走在路上的工人穿什么颜色的衣服才能注意到季节的更迭——他们五月穿粉红色衣服，七月穿棕色，九月穿黑色，春天则是一身素白。她已度过了最初发病的危险期，满怀憧憬和希望，然而除了跟迪克过日子，再也无法实现别的希望；至于抚养儿女，她只是假做一番柔情，就像对待孤儿一样。她喜欢的人多为愤世嫉俗者，那些人搅乱了她的生活，对她有害无益。她试图在那些人身上发现生命的活力，以为正是这种活力使得他们具有独立精神、创造才能和坚强的意志，但最终一无所获，因为这种活力是他们在童年时代奋斗时产生的，已成为彼时的秘密，早已遗忘在了爪哇国里。那些人更感兴趣的是她文静的外表和风度，岂不知这也是她病症的一种表现。她只拥有迪克，这让她感到十分孤独，而迪克又不愿被任何人拥有。

他多次想对她撒手不管，由着她去，但每一次都未能如愿。他们在一起度过了许多美好时光，不知有多少次彻夜长谈，有说不尽的温馨话语。每一次，他都那么深情缱绻，但一转身就会恢复自我，使得她怀里只剩下了幻影——她茫然地望着那幻影千呼万唤，但她清楚，要他即刻回来，纯粹是奢望。

这时，他用劲拍了拍枕头，躺下来，像日本人那样把后颈压在枕头上，以减缓血液的循环，睡了个回笼觉。起床后，他开始刮脸，而尼科尔也醒了，在屋里到处走动，对孩子和仆人发出简短明了的指示。拉尼尔进来看他父亲刮脸——住在精神病诊所跟前，他耳濡目染，渐渐对父亲产生了非同一般的信赖感和崇敬之心，而对其他大多数成人则有些不屑一顾。在他看来，那些病人要么举止古怪，要么缺乏生气，都是些没有个性的浑浑噩噩的人。他是个英俊、有出息的男孩，迪克在他身上没少花时间，父子俩的关系如同一个慈祥但又严厉的长官与一位恭敬的士兵。

“咦，”拉尼尔问，“你刮脸时怎么总要在头发上沾一点肥皂沫？”

迪克小心翼翼地张开涂了肥皂沫的嘴巴说：“我一直都不知道原因，经常为此感到纳闷。大概是因为修整鬓角时，肥皂沫沾在了食指上，可它怎么跑到了我的头发上，我就不知道了。”

“明天来我要好好观察一下原因。”

“一大早，空着肚子，你就只关心这个问题？”

“其实，不能称之为问题。”

“由你怎么说吧。”

半小时后，迪克收拾好，就到行政楼里去了。他已经三十八岁了，却仍不愿留胡子。不过，跟在里维埃拉那时相比，他多了几分医生的气质。在这家诊所，他住了有一年半的时间了。这儿的设备在欧洲算得上数一数二，跟多姆勒教授的诊所一样是现代化的。这儿没有医院里常见的那种孤零零、黑乎乎、看上去很凄凉的楼房，而是像一个别致的小村庄，乍看有些散乱，实则浑然一体。迪克和尼科尔苦心孤诣地要给这儿增加一种情调，把这个诊所布置得美轮美奂。但凡途经苏黎世的心理学家，都要来这儿参观。如果再增设一个专门喝茶的地方，这儿都可以说是个乡间俱乐部了。“野蔷薇”楼和“山毛榉”楼对那些心灵陷入永久黑暗的患者而言就是家园，一片小树林把它们与主楼隔开，使它们就像隐蔽的据点。后面是一大片种蔬菜的农田，患者有时会下田干些农活。用于工作疗法的工作间共有三间，都在一幢房子里，戴弗医生每天早晨都要来这儿巡访。木工操作间里阳光灿烂，弥漫着锯末和陈年木头散发出的香气。这儿总有六七个人在钉呀刨呀锯呀的——他们沉默不语，在他走过时，会抬起头看他，表情庄重。他自己就是一个优秀的木工，有时会用平静、亲切而又兴趣盎然的声音同他们讨论某种工具的效率。隔壁是书籍装订工作间，来这儿干活的患者病情极不稳定，康复的概率都不大。在最后一个工作间，患者们干的活是制作珠子、编织和打造铜器。他们愁容满面，唉声叹气，似乎遇到了解决不了的难题——他们的叹息意味着他们又要开始新一轮的思考——他们的思维不像正常人那样是直线的，而是无休无止的、循环性的，一圈又一圈，永无止境。不过，他们制造的物品色彩亮丽，使陌生人一时会产生幻觉，错以为是在幼儿园里，一切都很正常。戴弗医生只要一进门，患者们便会喜色满面，因为他们大多都喜欢他，胜过喜欢格雷戈罗维斯医生。那些在上流社会待过的患者，无一例外，对他的喜欢更要多几分。也有个别病人认为他对他们关心不够，或者认为他不够坦率，有点装腔作势。他们的这些反应同迪克在日常生活中遇到的情况没有什么两样，只不过这些病人的精神不正常，心态是扭曲的。

一位英国女子总要跟他谈她感兴趣的话题。

“今晚咱们听音乐吗？”

“我不知道，”他回答，“我没有见到拉迪斯劳医生。你喜欢昨晚萨克斯夫人和朗斯特里特先生演奏的乐曲吗？”

“还凑合吧。”

“我倒觉得很不错——尤其是肖邦的钢琴曲。”

“我觉得不过如此。”

“你什么时候给我们弹上一曲呢？”

她耸耸肩膀——多年来，她只要一听到这个问题就很开心。

“再说吧。不过，我的水平可不行哟。”

大家心里都有数，知道她压根就没登台演奏过。她的两个姐姐都是出类拔萃的音乐家——她们小时候一起练琴，只有她对音乐一窍不通。

从工作间出来，迪克去巡访“野蔷薇”楼和“山毛榉”楼。从外表看，这两幢楼同其他楼一样都有着欢快的气氛——尼科尔亲自设计房间的装饰和家具，可谓巧夺天工，其基本原则就是对铁窗、铁栅栏以及患者用的不可移动的家具什么的，进行巧妙的掩饰。她表现出了丰富的想象力和非凡的创造力（人们在她身上看不到有这种能力，但她的设计却将它表露无遗）。不知道内情的访客看见窗户上那轻巧、精致、漂亮的饰品，做梦也不会想到它们竟然是结实、坚固的窗户栅栏，想不到那些反映着现代人品味的管子家具竟然比爱德华时代[58]的家具还要结实耐用——就连花饰也像握在铁掌中一样牢固，反正每一件饰品、每一件摆设，似乎是随意放在那儿，其实如房屋的大梁一般必不可少。在她不知疲倦的慧眼的设计下，每个房间的空间都得到了最大限度的利用。有人称赞她，她就轻描淡写地说自己只不过是个技术较好的管子工罢了。

在心理状况正常的人看来，这里的怪现象比比皆是。戴弗医生每次到男患者住的“野蔷薇”楼，常常会觉得挺有意思——这儿有个矮小的怪人，是个露阴癖，声称他可以一丝不挂地从巴黎的星形广场走到协和广场，途中不会受到性骚扰，即便出了问题他也可以搞定。迪克觉得他的话也许不无道理。

他最感兴趣的还是主楼的一个女患者。此人约有三十岁，是个美国画家，长期侨居巴黎，来诊所已有半年的时间。她的病史不详。她的一个表哥偶然发现她患了精神病，而且病情很严重，就送她到巴黎近郊的一家主要收治观光客中的瘾君子和酒鬼的诊所进行刺激治疗，但效果不佳，于是带她来了瑞士。来的时候，她非常漂亮，现在却满脸是疮，痛不欲生。对她多次进行验血，均未发现问题，最后只好勉强地将她的病症诊断为神经性湿疹。近两个月，她被关在病房里接受治疗，犹如被关在“铁处女”[59]里。在她的幻觉世界里，她头脑清晰，甚至可以说是思维敏捷。

她是迪克尤为关注的病人。她发病时情绪异常激动，别的医生都束手无策，只有迪克能够使她“转危为安”。几个星期前，她曾多日彻夜难眠，痛苦不堪，弗朗茨对她施催眠术，让她有了几个小时必要的睡眠，但以后再试就不灵了。迪克不太相信催眠术，也极少使用，因为他知道自己每次都无法产生实施催眠术的那种心境——他曾对尼科尔用过此术，结果惹来的却是尼科尔的冷嘲热讽和讥笑。

他走进二十号病房时，那个女病人双眼肿得很厉害，根本看不见他。只听她用一种响亮、圆润、深沉、有些发颤的声音问道：“这要持续多久？怎么没个完了？”

“不会太久的。拉迪斯劳医生告诉我，说整块地方都消肿了。”

“假如让我知道自己究竟造了什么孽才有这样的报应，那我会坦然接受的。”

“不能将其神秘化，否则就是不理智的。我们认为这只是一种精神上的现象，跟羞愧的心理有关。你是不是在小的时候经常感到羞愧？”

她脸朝天躺在病床上，回答说：“自从懂事以来，我没有做过可羞愧的事情。”

“难道你就没有过小毛病、小过错？”

“我没做过任何可自责的事情。”

“你真够幸运的。”

女病人想了想，接着她的声音便透过脸上的绷带传了出来，里面含着几分凄苦：“若论命运，我和别的敢于挑战男性的女子是相同的。”

“恐怕叫你感到意外的是，这样的挑战无异于刀光剑影的战斗。”他也换上了她那种说大道理的口气，侃侃而论。

“的确像刀光剑影的战斗。”她略作思忖后说，“你面对强敌，要么获得损失惨重的胜利，要么一败涂地，遭受毁灭性的打击，成为残垣断壁中的孤魂野鬼。”

“可你没有一败涂地，也没有遭受毁灭性的打击。”他对她说，“你敢肯定你参加过刀光剑影的战斗吗？”

“你看看我就知道了！”她愤怒地喊了起来。

“你吃了不少苦，但许多女子由于错以为自己是顶天立地的男子汉，也都吃了不少苦。”他见他们的谈话正在变成一场争论，于是便退缩了，息事宁人地说道，“不管怎么说，你不能把一次的失利当作最后的败局。”

她冷笑道：“净说漂亮话！”这一声发自于她那痛苦心房的谴责令他锐气大减。

“我们很想知道你来这儿的真正原因……”他刚开口要说什么，却被她打断了。

“我来这儿本身就是一种象征。我想也许你会知道其中的含义。”

“象征着你病了。”他机械地说。

“我在这儿差一点就会有所发现，你说会是什么发现呢？”

“发现了更严重的病。”

“就这些？”

“就这些。”他讨厌自己说谎，但此时此刻，由于这个话题过于广泛，也只能这么说了，“除此以外，就只有意识糊涂和心境混乱了。别怪我说你……我们非常清楚你身体遭受的痛苦，但只有面对每天会有的问题，不论这些问题多么琐碎和乏味，你才能重新回到原来的状态。之后……也许你就能重新去探索……”

他放慢了语速，边想边说，唯恐词穷：“……去探索无边的精神世界。”探索精神世界是艺术家的使命，然而对她来说并不适合，因为她过于脆弱、敏感，也许最终可以在某种宁静的神秘主义圈子里找到归宿。探索精神世界的人，必须气血充盈、身体强壮，有着粗犷的气质，经得起风雨，面对困境处之泰然。

有句话溜到嘴边，他却没说出口：“你不适合探索精神世界，因为这样的工作过于严峻。”

然而，女病人的痛苦是那样强烈、沉重，使他深感同情，几乎可以说产生了怜香惜玉的感情。他真想把她搂在怀里，就像他常常搂尼科尔那般，甚至愿意欣赏在她身上已根深蒂固的错误。橘红色的阳光透过拉下的百叶窗照进来；她躺在床上，身体就像一具石棺，表情茫然，说出的话是在探寻她那虚无缥缈的病因，谁知越是探寻，反而使之越是抽象。

他起身时，对方泪如岩浆，一滴一滴落在了她的绷带上。

“一定有原因的，”女病人喃喃自语，“一定会水落石出的。”

他弯下腰，吻了吻她的额头，说道：“咱们大家一起努力吧。”

离开病房，他叫了一个护士去照料她。接下来，他还要去巡访其他病人，其中有一个是个十五岁的美国女孩。女孩小的时候，家里一心想叫她过快乐的生活，谁料却事与愿违。他现在去看她，是因为她刚用一把指甲剪把她的一头秀发给剪了。诊所对她束手无策——她家有神经官能症病史，而她本人精神状态不稳定，难以对症下药。她父亲精神正常，头脑很清楚，竭尽全力想保护好自己精神失常的子女，唯恐他们受到生活中各种问题的困扰，结果适得其反，反而妨碍了子女们发展应对人生中风风雨雨的能力。迪克对这个小病人无计可施，只好说道：“海伦，你遇到麻烦务必要找护士，必须学会向别人请教。答应我，下次一定要找护士！”

让一个精神病人许诺无异于对牛弹琴！巡访途中，他又看望了一位来自高加索的身体虚弱的流亡者。这位患者被牢牢地绑在一张吊床上，而吊床又浸在温水浴缸里，让他接受温水浴治疗。随后，他还看望了一位葡萄牙将军的三个女儿——这三位千金几乎不知不觉都患上了一种麻痹性痴呆症。出了她们的病房，他到隔壁去探视一位精神崩溃的精神病医生，安慰那位医生说他的病情已好转，而且在不断好转。那个医生盯着他的脸瞧，因为唯有在那儿才可以了解实情，让一颗心感到踏实，如若在那儿找不到答案，他会从迪克的话语中寻求安慰。巡查完病房，迪克解雇了一名懒惰的护工。这时，已到了吃午饭的时候。





第十五章


同病人一起进餐是一件苦差事，迪克觉得索然无味。当然，一起进餐的人不包括“野蔷薇”楼或“山毛榉”楼里的患者。这种聚餐初看很平常，但总弥漫着一种浓重的郁悒气氛。医生们海阔天空地神聊，但大多数病人很少开口，只是默默地埋头吃饭，仿佛上午干活已累坏了，或者面对这样的场合有些情绪低落，不想说话。

吃完饭，迪克回到家中。尼科尔在客厅里，一脸怪异的神情，递给他一封信说道：“你看看这个。”

他打开了信。此信是一个新近出院的女子写来的，出院时精神状态堪忧，似乎还不稳定。她以坚定的语气指责迪克勾引她的女儿（她女儿是在她病重时来看护她的）。她说她相信戴弗夫人或许愿意知道这一情况，了解她丈夫的“真面目”。

迪克把信又读了一遍。尽管信里用英语书写的词句准确，意思清晰，但他还是认出它是出自于一个疯人之手。她的女儿是个皮肤微黑的白人女孩，有点水性杨花。一次，他到苏黎世出差，女孩也要跟着去，他便答应了，当晚就带她回到了诊所。他吻了女孩——那是随意的一吻，几乎可以说是迁就性的一吻。后来，女孩企图跟他进一步发展关系，但他不感兴趣。最后，可能是由于这个缘故，女孩恨上了他，把母亲也接走了。

“这封信满纸都是荒唐言，”他说，“我跟那个女孩根本没有任何关系。我甚至都不喜欢她。”

“是呀，我也愿意这么想。”尼科尔说。

“你肯定不会相信的，是吧？”

“我一直坐在这儿，没有离你而去。”

他在她身边坐下，压低声音，以一种责备的口吻说：“太离谱了。这封信可是一个精神病人写的！”

“我也曾是个精神病人。”

他站起来，以命令的语气说道：“这种无聊的事，咱们就不说了，尼科尔。去把孩子们叫来，咱们出去透透气。”

迪克开车带他们沿着湖的小岬行驶，穿过一片常青树树林，汽车的挡风玻璃反射着金色的阳光和粼粼的湖水映影。这是迪克的雷诺牌私家车，车身狭小，除了孩子，大人们能把半个身子都露在外边。家庭女教师坐在后排，挤在两个孩子中间，犹如一根高高竖立着的桅杆。他们对这条路非常熟悉，一路闻得到松针的清香味和黑色炉子的烟味。太阳高悬犹如一张明显的面庞，火辣辣的阳光射在孩子们的草帽上。

尼科尔沉默不语，冷冷的目光直射过来，让迪克感到浑身不自在。跟她在一起，他常常感到孤寂。平时，她老是叫他心烦，喋喋不休地把闷在心里的话讲给他听（这些话她从不对别人说，只讲给他听），说什么“我这个啦……我那个啦”。但这天下午，要是她喋喋不休、唠唠叨叨地说上一阵，让他从中了解她的想法，他会很高兴的。一般来说，只要她缄口不语，关上心扉的大门，情况就非常危险了。

在楚格，家庭女教师下车离开了他们。戴弗一家驱车前往阿吉里集市，途中不断有庞大的蒸汽压路机给他们让路。到了目的地，迪克停好车，尼科尔动也不动，只是用眼睛望着他。“该下车了，亲爱的。”他催促了一声。尼科尔突然一咧嘴，苦笑了一下，样子十分可怕，使得他的心一阵抽搐。不过，他装作没看见，又催了一声：“下车吧。你下来，好让孩子们也下车。”

“哦，我这就下来。”她回答说（她似乎别有心思，这些话是硬挤出来的，快得让他听都听不清），“别担心，我会下车的……”

“那就快下来吧。”

迪克走到尼科尔身边，她把脸偏过去，脸上仍挂着那种苦笑，含着讥讽，显得疏远。拉尼尔几次跟她说话，说的是《潘趣和朱迪》傀儡戏[60]，只有在这时她才会注意力集中，平心静气和儿子交谈。

迪克苦思冥想，不知该怎么办才好。他扮演着双重角色，既是她的丈夫，又是她的精神病医生，正是这一点使他感到自己对她越来越无能为力。在这六年之中，她屡屡发作，令他穷于应对，有时叫他不胜怜悯，有时对他施展一些小手段（这些现象显得怪诞和离谱）——只有在事过之后，他才一方面感到紧张的心情松弛下来，同时意识到，她在跟他较真的对垒中成为取胜的一方。

托普西提出了一个问题：这出木偶戏里的潘趣是不是和去年他们在戛纳看过的那个潘趣是同一个人物？全家就此展开了讨论。之后，他们一路溜达，开始逛集市，两旁净是琳琅满目的露天货摊。但见上面铺陈着女人们的丝绒背心，背心上摆着女式呢帽，以及色彩绚丽的产自于各地的裙子（这些产品跟蓝色和橙色的货车以及陈列的其他货品相比，倒也显得淑雅）。肚皮舞蹈者发出叫喊声，身上的铃铛叮当作响。

突然，尼科尔撒腿就跑——事出突然，让迪克都没来得及反应。他远远看见她那黄色的衣衫在前面的人群中闪动，犹如一条飘带，飘荡在现实与虚幻之间。他立刻追了上去。她在前边悄无声息地跑，他在后边不声不响地追。她这一跑，他更觉得下午的阳光刺眼，闷热难忍，一时间竟把孩子们都忘了。待他想起来，便又跑回来找孩子们，然后拽着他们的胳膊去寻尼科尔，目光从一个个货摊扫过。

“太太，”他对一位站在一台白色摇奖机后面的少妇叫道，“我可以把孩子交给你照看一会儿吗？我有急事……我给你十个法郎。”

“好的。”

他把孩子领进摊位叮咛道：“跟这位好心的太太待在一起！”

“好的，迪克。”

他似离弦的箭一般跑了，但已不见了尼科尔的踪影。他围着旋转木马绕着圈地找，不停地跟着跑，后来才意识到木马也在转圈，而他的眼睛始终盯着同一匹木马。随后，他挤进买饮料的人群里找了找。末了，他突然记起了尼科尔的一个嗜好，便掀开一个占卜者帐篷的门帘，朝里面张望。一个浑浊的声音冲他说道：“尼罗河第七位公主生下的第七个女儿……请进，先生！”

他放下门帘，朝位于湖边的一家游乐场跑去——在蓝色的天幕下，那儿有一架小型摩天轮在慢慢转动着。他一眼就瞧见了尼科尔。

此刻，她独自一人坐在摩天轮顶部的座舱里。当她的座舱降下来时，他看见她在哈哈怪笑，于是便躲在了人群里。摩天轮又转了一圈，人们发现她在歇斯底里地大叫：“快看我呀！”

“快看那个英国女子！”人们纷纷在叫。

她又一次降了下来——这次，摩天轮在音乐声中慢慢停住了。十几个人围住她的座舱，见她怪笑，大家也跟着傻笑。可是，她一看见迪克，笑声便戛然而止了。她拔腿想溜，企图躲开他，却被他拽住了胳膊，拉着她走开了

“你怎么能如此失态？”

“原因你心知肚明。”

“不，我不清楚。”

“真是咄咄怪事……放开我……你真是把我当成傻瓜了。那女孩怎样瞧你，你以为我看不出来吗？对，就是那个黑黑的小女孩！哼，好可笑呀，竟跟一个不满十五岁的小姑娘眉来眼去！你以为我没看到吗？”

“在这儿坐坐，让心静一静。”

他们在一张桌子旁坐了下来。她目光里满是狐疑——只见她把手在眼前挥了挥，仿佛要挥开遮住视线的东西。接着，便听她说道：“我要喝一杯！我要喝白兰地！”

“你不能喝白兰地……要是你想喝酒，可以来杯黑啤酒。”

“我为什么不能喝白兰地？”

“咱们别争了。听我说……关于那个女孩的事，纯粹是错觉。你理解‘错觉’这个词的意思吗？”

“每次我看见你不想让我看见的事，你总说是错觉。”

他宛如身处噩梦之中，产生了一种朦胧的负疚感。常有这样的现象——我们在梦境里被指控犯了某种罪行，当时觉得的确有罪，不可抵赖，可是梦醒后却发现自己是无辜的。于是，他将目光移开，不敢正视她。

“我把孩子们留给了货摊上的一位吉卜赛女人。咱们该去接他们了。”他说道。

“你以为你是谁？”她仍在不依不饶地指责他，“莫非你是斯文加利[61]不成？”

十五分钟前，他们还是一个不可分割的家庭。而此时，当他用不情愿的肩膀将她顶到了一个角落时，才明白他们的这个家（大人和孩子全都包括在内）只不过是一个危险的组合，是偶然拼凑在一起的。

“咱们回家去吧。”

“家！”她吼叫道，声音狂怒，嗓门高得都有点发颤和嘶哑了，“想一想吧，你不觉得这个家在腐烂吗？你不觉得每打开一个盒子，都会看到孩子们的尸骨在里面腐烂吗？真是肮脏！”

她说完，就像泄了气的皮球一样蔫了下来，这叫迪克松了口气。这时，她恢复了理智，也能够察言观色了，立刻看到了迪克脸上忍让的表情，于是她的神情也变得温和了，低声下气地恳求道：“帮帮我，帮帮我吧，迪克！”

迪克感到一阵心痛。眼前的这个美丽的躯壳怎么扶也扶不正，总是东倒西歪，靠在他身上，令人不胜伤感。男人就应该帮助妻子，挑大梁，拿主意，当家理财，从某种程度而言这就是义务。可有谁知道，迪克和尼科尔是两位一体，是平等的，既不是对立的，又不是互补的！她就是他，已渗入了他的骨髓。看着她精神崩溃，他怎能无动于衷、袖手旁观！他的心底顿时涌起一股柔情和怜悯，决定采用具有现代特征的方法进行干预——今晚就从苏黎世请个护士来照料她。

“你是能够帮助我的！”尼科尔的声音甜蜜，语气却强硬，而那声音在强烈震撼着他，“你以前帮过我，现在也能够帮助我。”

“我只能按以前的老办法帮你。”

“总有人是能帮助我的。”

“情况或许如此，但最能帮助你的是你自己。咱们去找孩子们吧。”

集市上有很多配备白色摇奖机的货摊。迪克见前边有个白色摇奖机，就走过去问孩子们的下落，对方回答说不知道，这叫他不由慌了神。尼科尔站在旁边，眼露凶光，气得乱骂那两个孩子，说他们是堕落世界的人，而她要摧毁那个堕落世界。过了一会儿，迪克就找到了孩子们，只见几个女人正乐呵呵地观赏他们，就像观赏漂亮的衣服，还有几个乡下孩子也在围观。

“谢谢你，先生。哎呀，先生真大方。我很高兴效力，先生，太太。再见，孩子们。”那位少妇接过迪克给她的十法郎，感激地说。

他们驱车回家，心里充满了忧伤，就连汽车也被他们的忧虑和痛苦压得发沉，孩子们则噘着嘴，显得非常失望。悲伤露出了一副不常见的嘴脸，是那样的狰狞可怕。到了楚格附近，尼科尔使了使劲儿，从牙缝里挤出了一句话，说公路一侧远处的一幢黄颜色的房屋朦朦胧胧的，看上去像是一幅还没干的油画——这话她以前就说过，此时重复就像是要抓住一根猛然抛过来的救命绳子。

迪克想静一静——他知道一回家就会有争执，也许要花费很多时间把事情的经过向她细细解释。尼科尔这样的人格分裂者，被定义为“精神分裂症患者”是非常合适的——有时你对她没必要解释，有时则说什么也解释不清。所以，必须以积极、稳定、持之以恒的态度对待她，让通向现实的道路永远敞开，使得逃避现实的道路寸步难行。不过，疯狂的人也有其智慧的一面，会想出各种办法来，犹如无孔不入的水，可以漫过堤坝，或绕过堤坝。这就需要许多人共同努力加以防范。这一次，他觉得有必要让尼科尔自我治疗——他想耐心等待，等待她回忆起先前的经历并感到厌恶。他苦心策划了一番，打算恢复一年前的那种恬适、放松的生活方式。

他把汽车朝一座小山开去，从那儿可以抄近路回诊所。他一踩油门，向山腰旁的一小段平坦路面冲去，汽车猛烈摇晃，东倒西歪，两轮腾空，吓得尼科尔尖叫不已，发疯地用手抓住了方向盘。他把她的手推开，扶正方向盘，谁知汽车又向旁边一偏，冲下公路，一头钻进低矮的灌木丛，颠簸了一下，以九十度斜撞上了一棵树木，这才慢慢停了下来。

孩子们在尖叫，尼科尔也在尖叫，还骂着人，用手去抓迪克的脸。迪克首先想到的是汽车，不知它倾斜到了什么程度。他拨开尼科尔的手，爬上车身，把孩子们抱出来。接着，他仔细一看，发现汽车的位置还稳定，于是就放下心，站在那儿又是发抖，又是喘粗气。

“你太不像话了！”他吼了一声。

只见尼科尔在那儿咯咯咯地狂笑，既不惭愧，也不害怕，亦不关心。要是有外人来现场，绝对想不到她就是肇事者——她笑啊笑，就像小孩子轻松逃过惩罚那般。

“你害怕了，是不是？”她取笑道，“你怪怕死的！”

听她这么一说，惊魂未定的迪克倒怀疑自己是否真的害怕了。可是，再看看孩子们一脸的紧张，将他俩轮番打量，他不由怒从心头起，恨不得撕碎她那张讪笑的脸。

山上有一家旅馆，透过山林可看见它的一角——从盘山路过去有半公里的路，而从山坡爬上去只有一百码。

他对拉尼尔说道：“你抓住托普西的手，就这样，抓紧点，爬上那个山头……看见那条小路了吗？你到那家旅馆去，对他们说：‘戴弗家的汽车坏了’。他们听了就会来人的。”

拉尼尔不知道究竟发生了什么事，但他觉得不妙，肯定出现了前所未有过的情况。

“你们要做什么，迪克？”拉尼尔问道。

“我们待在这儿看着汽车。”

两个孩子走了，对母亲瞧也没瞧一眼。迪克在他们身后喊道：“经过上边那条路的时候要小心！注意着两边！”

他和尼科尔互相对视，他们的眼睛就像隔着一个院落往外喷火的窗户。后来，尼科尔取出一只粉盒，照了照盒中的镜子，理了理两边的鬓发。迪克则将目光投向孩子们，看着他们消失在了半山腰的树林中。接下来，他绕着汽车走了一圈，察看车子的损坏情况，想着怎样把它弄回到公路上。根据泥土上的痕迹看得出，汽车是颠簸着冲了一百多英尺才停了下来。此时，他对尼科尔简直厌恶极了（这种厌恶感跟愤怒有所不同）。

没过几分钟，旅馆老板就跑了过来。

“天哪！”他叫了起来，“这是怎么回事？你们开快车了吧？还算幸运！要不是那棵树，你们就翻下山去了！”

这位旅馆老板埃米尔围着宽大的黑围裙，胖胖的脸上热汗直流。趁着他在场，迪克对尼科尔使了个眼色，示意她让自己扶她下车。尼科尔没理会，而是自己翻过较低的那一侧车身跳了下来，结果在山坡上失去平衡，跪倒在地，但马上又爬了起来。她看着两个男人奋力推车，脸上露出了不屑的神态。即使这样，迪克也不去计较，而是对她说道：“你到孩子那儿等着吧，尼科尔。”

她刚走开，他便想起她刚才要喝科尼亚克白兰地，不由有点担心，因为旅馆里是可以喝到这种酒的。他叫埃米尔别管汽车了，说过后叫个大卡车司机来，把它拖到公路上就是了。说完，他们就急急忙忙回旅馆了。





第十六章


“我想出去一趟，”他告诉弗朗茨，“一个月左右吧，或者说能待多久到时候再说吧。”

“这有什么不行呢，迪克？原来咱们就是这么安排的——去多长时间由你定。要是你和尼科尔……”

“我不想同尼科尔一起去。我要一个人去。最近发生的事弄得我头昏脑涨，要是一天能睡上两个小时，那真是茨温利的奇迹了。”

“你想过一段闲云野鹤般的潇洒日子？”

“应该说是‘出差’。这样说吧。如果我去柏林参加精神病学会议，这里的情况你能应付得了吗？这三个月她很正常，也喜欢她的护士。上帝呀，在这个世界上我只能求助于你了。”

弗朗茨嘴里含混地说了句什么，心里有点缺乏底气，不知道自己是否能不辜负这位合伙人的重托。

一个星期后，迪克在苏黎世坐车去机场，然后搭乘大客机飞往慕尼黑。飞机轰鸣着腾空而起，翱翔于蓝天。他觉得肢体有些麻木，这才意识到自己是何等疲惫。这时，他的心里一片宁静，一种静谧感悄然而至，使他忘掉了一切——就让病人自己操心他们的病吧，就让飞机轰鸣吧，就让飞行员决定航向吧！他并不打算去参加这样的一个学术会议——开会的情况完全可以想象得出来，还不就是散发散发布洛伊勒和老福雷尔的新作（这种书更适宜在家里看）。会上还要宣读一个美国人的论文，此人认为通过拔牙或者烧灼扁桃体腺便可以治疗精神分裂症——可笑的是，这样的观点竟然还能得到尊重，恐怕多半是因为美国是一个富裕强大的国家。另外参加会议的还有一些美国代表，其中包括红头发的施瓦茨，此人有一张圣人的面孔，不厌其烦地穿梭往来于欧美两大洲。其他的十几位美国代表属于唯利是图的学者，个个都是猥琐相，他们来参加会议，一方面是想抬高他们的声望，以便将来骗大钱，另一方面则是想猎取一些新的奇谈怪论，好掺进他们的异端邪说，达到混淆视听、浑水摸鱼的目的。参会的可能还有愤世嫉俗的拉丁人，以及来自维也纳的弗洛伊德的门徒。其中的翘楚当属伟大的荣格，无论是针对人类学研究，还是针对在校学生的心理研究，他都有精彩的论述、清晰的观点以及非凡的结论。大会一开始都是美国人唱主角，从形式和仪式上看，有一股“扶轮国际”[62]的味道。之后，组织严密、充满活力的欧洲代表会向他们发起挑战。但最终，美国人会亮出王牌——宣布捐献大笔的财物，兴建大型诊所和培训学校。面对一串串数字，欧洲人一个个灰头土脸，连走路都蹑手蹑脚的。然而，迪克可不愿到那儿看到这样的场面。

到了福拉尔贝格[63]境内，飞机绕过阿尔卑斯山的山峰，脚下的村庄美得像田园诗，让迪克看得心旷神怡。一眼望去，总能看见四五个村子，每个村子中央都有一座教堂。从高空看大地的景色，可以一览无余，无异于观赏玩偶和士兵的游戏——政治家、将军和所有的隐士都是这般观察事物。不管怎样，大地的景色叫人看了心情放松。

一位英国人隔着过道跟他搭话，但他近来觉得英国人有些讨厌。此时的英国就像一个装腔作势的富人，自己纵欲狂欢过后，又想和家里人和好言欢，但谁都看得出他只不过是想找回尊严，好重新作威作福。

迪克随身带了几本杂志，那是他在机场买的，有《世纪》、《电影》、《画刊》和《飞叶杂志》[64]。但他觉得遐想比看杂志更有意思——他想象自己下了飞机，走进村庄，同农夫们握手；想象自己在教堂做礼拜（就跟小时候跟父亲去布法罗的教堂做礼拜一样），周围净是穿着笔挺节日服装的教徒；想象自己到了近东[65]，听圣徒宣讲耶稣的故事，讲耶稣怎样被钉死在十字架上，后归葬于乐土；想象自己在教堂捐钱时，由于身后坐着那个臆想中的女孩，真不知该捐五美分还是十美分好。

那个英国人一直在冲着他说话，此时话题一转，说想借他的杂志看看。迪克乐得把杂志交给对方，这样他就可以沉湎于遐想，想象接下来的旅途会是什么样的情景。他想象自己穿着澳大利亚羊皮衣服，衣服上的绒毛长长的，看上去像狼一样；想象自己到了一个欢乐的世界，那儿是地中海乐园，橄榄树上沾染着尘土，散发着清香，萨沃纳[66]附近的农村姑娘的脸蛋绯红鲜嫩，就像弥撒书中的插图一般，他真想一把抓住那个农村姑娘将其带出国……

……但他不得不丢下她，因为他必须朝前走，到希腊群岛去——彼处有海水混浊、异国情调的港口，海岸上有迷途的姑娘以及流行歌曲中讴歌的朗月。他的想象有一部分是来自于童年时代丰富多彩的憧憬——在那个乱糟糟的廉价商品店里，他绞尽脑汁地加以保留，才使得它们生动地再现。





第十七章


汤米·巴尔班是个统治者，汤米是个英雄……迪克在慕尼黑玛丽恩广场的一家咖啡馆同他意外相逢。在这里，有的人在“织锦”垫子上掷骰子赌博，有的在议论时事，有的则噼噼啪啪地斗牌。

汤米坐在桌旁，粗犷地朗声大笑：“哈哈——哈哈！哈哈——哈哈！”跟平时一样，他喝的并不多，但他硬装出一股英雄豪气来，让旁边的人总有点怕他。最近，华沙的一位外科医生给他做手术，把他的头盖骨截去了八分之一，然后用针缝合，恐怕就连咖啡馆里最弱的人将餐巾打个结也能击杀他。

“……这是基利切弗王子……”此人是俄国王子，五十岁，头发花白，一副饱受磨难的样子，“……这是麦吉本先生……这是汉南先生……”后者黑头发，黑眼睛，性情活泼，是一个马戏团小丑。

汉南一见迪克，就跟他开起了玩笑，说道：“握手前我先问你一声：你纠缠我小姨究竟想干什么？”

“我……”

“我的话你也听见了。你到慕尼黑来究竟要干什么？”

“哈哈——哈哈！”汤米大笑不止。

“难道你自己没有小姨吗？为什么你不去纠缠她们？”

迪克也笑了起来。

汉南把攻击的矛头一转，又说道：“咱们暂且不谈我小姨的事。我怎么知道你是不是瞎编的。你我素不相识，认识还不到半个小时，你就跟我扯你小姨那乱七八糟的事。我怎么知道你是不是隐瞒了什么事？”

汤米又大笑起来。随后，他心平气和，但语气坚定地说：“够了，卡利。你请坐，迪克。你好吗？尼科尔怎么样？”

迪克对这里的人都不太喜欢，也不在意他们的存在。他来这儿是放松休息的，以便迎接将来的战斗，就像一个第二防线的优秀运动员，上场前要得到充足的休息（资质稍差的运动员往往貌似休息，而实则神经始终都很紧张，完全是自我糟践）。

汉南并没有完全罢休。只见他走向近旁的一架钢琴，弹了起来，不时瞥迪克一眼，脸上又出现愤恨的神色，嘴里哼哼唧唧地说“你的小姨”，随即又用抑扬有致的调子唱道：“我并没说什么小姨不小姨，而说的是裤子。[67]”

“喂，你还好吧？”汤米又问了迪克一声。“你看起来不如以前那么……”他费劲地想找一个恰当的词，“……不如以前那么快活，那么有风度了。你明白我的意思。”

这话听上去非常像是嫌迪克缺乏活力，一下子激怒了迪克。他原想反唇相讥，嘲讽嘲讽汤米和基利切弗王子穿的那身怪里怪气的服装。他觉得他们的服装无论做工还是款式都花里胡哨，完全可以穿着在星期天去贝尔大街[68]招摇过市。谁知基利切弗王子先开了口，说道：“看得出你在观察我们的衣服。我们刚从俄国来，没来得及换。”

“这衣服可是波兰皇家裁缝做的。”汤米说，“这是真的……出自于毕苏斯基[69]的私人裁缝之手。”

“你们是不是在游历四方？”迪克问。

那二人大笑起来。王子亲昵地拍着汤米的后背说：“是的，我们在游历四方。的确是在游历四方。我们周游了整个俄国，简直十分有排场。”

迪克等着他做进一步解释，却听麦吉本先生在一旁说道：“他们是逃出来的。”

“你们在俄国成了囚犯？”

“这说的是我。”基利切弗王子解释说，一边用死鱼般的黄眼珠盯着迪克，“不是关在监狱里，而是躲了起来。”

“逃出来，你们遇到了不少麻烦吧？”

“是有些麻烦。我们越过边境时打死了三个红军士兵。汤米杀了两个……”他像法国人似的竖起两根指头，“我干掉了一个。”

“这我就不懂了。”麦吉本先生说，“他们为什么要阻止你们离境呢？”

汉南从钢琴旁转过身来，朝汤米和迪克挤了挤眼睛说：“麦吉本认为马克思的信徒与圣马克学校的学生一样呢。”

基利切弗王子的逃亡经历具有十足的传奇色彩——这位贵族跟自己以前的一个仆人一道藏了起来，隐姓埋名达九年之久，还在政府的一家面包房找到了工作；他十八岁的女儿在巴黎结识了汤米·巴尔班……听着他的讲述，迪克不由心想：这个旧时代出土文物般的干瘪老头不值得三个年轻人为之铤而走险。他问汤米和基利切弗是否感到过害怕。

“我怕的是寒冷。”汤米调侃地说，“一遇到寒冷，我就心慌。在战场上，遇到寒冷天气，我就怕得要命。”

这时，麦吉本站起身说：“恕不奉陪了。明天一早我要开车送妻子和孩子，还有家庭教师，送他们去茵斯布鲁克[70]。”

“我也要到那儿去呢。”迪克说。

“哦，是吗？”麦吉本叫道，“何不跟我们一起走？那是辆大型的帕卡德轿车[71]，只有我们一家几口……还有那位家庭女教师……”

“那恐怕不行……”

“当然，那位教师并不真的就是教师。”麦吉本望着迪克说道，样子十分狼狈，“实际上，我妻子认识你的大姨子芭比·沃伦。”

迪克不想跟自己不了解的人纠缠不清，于是便找了个借口说：“我已经和两个人约好，要跟他们一起去的。”

“是吗？”麦吉本的脸顿时沉了下来，“好吧，那就再见吧。”他走到近旁的一张桌子跟前，解下拴在桌腿上的两只纯种硬毛狗，准备离去。迪克可以想象得到，麦吉本一家老小，加上行李和两条汪汪乱叫的狗，还有那位家庭女教师，坐在一辆车上到茵斯布鲁克去，该会多么的拥挤。

“报社的记者说他们知道杀他的凶手是何人，”汤米说，“可他家的亲戚不让见报，因为凶案发生在一个地下酒吧里。你怎么看？”

“还不都是为了所谓的家族面子。”

汉南在钢琴上弹奏出一首高亢的曲子，想把他们的注意力吸引到他那儿。

“我不相信诺思早期写的那些曲子能经得起推敲，”他说，“即使不说欧洲人，美国人能写出那样东西的人也不在少数。”

迪克这才明白他们在谈论阿贝·诺思。

“唯一的区别在于阿贝是先行者。”汤米说。

“我不同意，”汉南坚持他的看法，“他空有优秀音乐家的名头——不过是个嗜酒如命的酒鬼，他的朋友硬要强词夺理地鼓吹他……”

“阿贝·诺思怎么了？他出什么事了？是不是又遇到麻烦啦？”

“你没读今天上午的《先驱报》？”

“没有。”

“他死了。他在纽约的一家地下酒吧里被人打了个半死，后来硬挣扎着爬回他下榻的马球俱乐部，在那儿咽了气……”

“阿贝·诺思死啦？”

“是的，千真万确。他们……”

“阿贝·诺思死啦？”迪克站了起来，“你肯定他死了吗？”

汉南转过身来冲着麦吉本说道：“他不是爬回了马球俱乐部，而是爬回了哈佛俱乐部。我敢肯定他不是马球俱乐部的会员。”

“报上是这么说的。”麦吉本固执地说。

“这肯定是弄错了。我很清楚。”

“反正他是在一家地下酒吧里被打死的。”

“若说马球俱乐部的会员，十有八九我都认识，”汉南说，“所以他去的一定是哈佛俱乐部。”

迪克站了起来，汤米也站了起来。基利切弗王子一直在想虚无的心事，也许在想自己逃离俄国后究竟会有怎样的前景——他千思百虑，忧心忡忡，不可能放下自己的心事去关心别的事。此时从遐想中猛醒，他也糊里糊涂跟着迪克他们走了。

“阿贝·诺思被人打死了！”

在回旅馆的路上，迪克神思恍惚，一直在想这件事。这时只听汤米说道：“裁缝在给我们做衣服，等他做好我们就上巴黎。我打算到证券交易所求职，穿这身衣服，他们肯定不会要我的。在你们国家，人人都想当百万富翁。你明天真的要走吗？连一顿饭都没来得及陪你吃呢！王子在慕尼黑好像有过一个情人，他给她打电话，得知她已去世五年了。我们打算同她的两个女儿一起吃顿饭。”

王子点头称是。

“也许可以请戴弗医生一起去。”

“不了，不了。”迪克急忙说。

夜间，他睡得很沉，很死，一觉醒来，看见窗外有一支缓慢移动的悲伤队伍经过。原来，那是老兵协会去阵亡者墓地敬献花圈——长龙一般的队伍里有一身戎装、头戴钢盔（即1914年“一战”时的那种钢盔）的军人，有身穿燕尾服、头戴丝绸帽的莽汉，有市民，也有贵族和普通人。人们步伐缓慢，表情凝重，追思那逝去的荣耀、昔日的战功以及淡忘的哀痛。他们的悲哀只是挂在脸上，而迪克却是痛在心里——他为阿贝之死，为自己十年的青春年华匆匆流逝而痛惜不已，肝胆欲裂。





第十八章


黄昏时分到达茵斯布鲁克，迪克把行李送往旅馆，然后向市区走去。落日余晖下，看得见马克西米连皇帝[72]跪着祈祷的雕像，他的雕像下面还有许多哀悼的信徒的雕像。大学校园里有四个耶稣会见习生，一边散步，一边读书。太阳下山后，那各种各样的大理石纪念碑（有纪念围困战事的，有纪念婚庆的，也有纪念盛大庆典的），全都迅速地消融在了夜色之中。他吃了一碗豌豆粥，里面放了些切碎的香肠，喝了四杯比尔森啤酒[73]，但拒绝吃那道被称作“皇帝蛋饼”的可怕的甜点心。

尽管这里也是山峰起伏、层峦叠嶂，但毕竟不是瑞士——瑞士在遥远的地方，尼科尔也远在天边。夜色黑透时，他到花园里散步，平心静气地想起了尼科尔，觉得她有许多值得他疼爱的地方。记得有一次，她踏着湿漉漉的草地向他走来，脚步急匆匆的，薄拖鞋上沾满了露珠。她站在他的鞋子上，紧贴着他，仰着脸，就像一本书摊开在他眼前。

“你不妨想一想你对我的爱，”她喃喃细语道，“我不求你永远爱我，只求你永远记住今晚，记住我对你的爱永远初心不改。”

然而，迪克为了灵魂的安宁，离开了家园。他心潮起伏，千思万想，分不清此刻是几点几分，分不清今天是几号、星期几，也分不清现在是何年何月——他迷失了自己。过去，他是何等聪颖果断，处理事务举重若轻——哪怕病人有再难的问题，到了他的手里都会迎刃而解。可是，自从在苏黎世湖畔遇见尼科尔（那时的尼科尔犹如石缝间的一朵小花），到遇见罗斯玛丽那一刻，他锐气大减，就像一把用钝了的剑。

他曾亲眼见过父亲在贫困的教区苦苦挣扎的情景。他天性淡泊名利，但不知怎的却萌生出了对金钱的渴望——这并非是为了追求生活稳定而产生的健康的渴望。在跟尼科尔结婚的时候，他是那样自信，那样独立和自由。但结婚之后，他就像寄人篱下，成了一个吃软饭的男人，自尊心被锁在了沃伦家的保险柜里。

“这件事，应该像欧洲大陆人那样体面地了断，但目前尚没有完结。我白白花了八年时间教富人学习做人的尊严，让他们掌握基本常识。不过，我还没有完蛋，手里还有许多王牌可出。”

他一边沉思，一边漫步于花影招摇的玫瑰花丛和簇簇湿润、散发着香气的不知名的蕨类植物间。这是一个晴暖的日子，但毕竟已入十月，会有阵阵凉意袭来，得把厚呢外套领口上的松紧带扣上。一个人影从一棵黑魆魆的树干后闪了出来，他认出是自己走出旅馆门厅时遇见的那个女子。现在的他会爱上任何一个漂亮的女子，爱她们在远处的娇姿，爱她们映在墙上的倩影。

那女子在观看城里的万家灯火，背对着他。他点了一支烟，她肯定能听见擦火柴的声音，但仍然一动不动。

这是邀请呢，还是一种无动于衷的表现？对于男女之间朴素的欲望以及如何满足这种欲望，他久已不闻不问，因而变得迟钝和信心不足了。不过，他知道游荡于这个隐蔽的矿泉疗养地的人，一定会有某种暗语沟通，彼此很快就可以熟识起来。

也许，他应该主动一点才对。陌生的孩子们碰到一块时会彼此一笑说：“咱们一起玩吧。”

他凑了上去，而那道人影却走开了。在自己还是个小青年的时候，他听说过无赖的推销员遭到拒绝的事情。莫非他成了那样的人物？他的心怦怦直跳，怪自己不经探查、剖析、分辨，就莽撞地行事。想到这里，他猛地抽身离去了，那女子也走了，离开那黑魆魆的树影，绕过长椅，迈着轻巧但坚实的步子，沿着小径走回旅馆去了。

次日上午，迪克和两位旅伴一起随一个导游去攀登博卡斯皮茨山峰[74]。他们来到高原牧场的上面，听着叮当叮当的牛颈铃声，顿觉心旷神怡。迪克期待着到一个小木屋里过夜，享受旅途疲劳，听凭导游安排一切，享受无人知晓他身份所带来的那份快乐。谁知中午时分，天气陡变，黑云压来，雷声携带着冰雹猝然而至。迪克和另一位登山者想继续爬山，但导游不愿意。他们只好怏怏地折回茵斯布鲁克，准备第二天再度出行。

在一家冷清的餐馆吃了晚餐，喝了一瓶烈性的当地酒，他感到兴奋。不知怎的，他突然想起了花园里的那场邂逅。晚餐前，他在门厅又遇见了那个女孩，这一次她看见了他，目光中露出对他的欣赏。这反倒叫他生出了几多心事，觉得自己曾经是何等意气昂扬，只消开口，不少漂亮女孩都会委身于他，现在自己几乎已心灰意冷，却又有了缠绵之情！为什么？

他的思绪如脱缰的野马，想到了昔日的禁欲行为，一种久别了的感情袭上心头——天呀，还不如回到里维埃拉去，跟珍妮丝·卡里卡门托或那个叫威尔伯哈兹的女孩同谐鱼水之欢！可是，占那种唾手可得的便宜，岂不枉费了这许多年的辛苦！

心情久久难以平静，他离开旅馆的平台，上楼回自己的房间继续沉思冥想。形单影只的他感到寂寞，而寂寞越发使他觉得孤独。

他在房间里来回踱步，一边脑海里浮想联翩，一边将登山服摊开放在微热的暖气片上。他又看了一眼尼科尔的电报（他在外旅行，她每天都给他拍电报）——那封电报仍没有拆开。也许是因为花园里的那场邂逅吧，晚餐前他迟迟不愿打开。拆封后，他发现原来是一封布法罗老家的电报，从苏黎世转了过来，上面写：“令尊昨夜安然离世。——霍姆斯”。

他愕然一惊，简直不敢相信这是真的。随后，一阵撕心裂肺的痛苦涌上心头，继而传遍了全身。

他把电文又看了一遍，颓然坐在了床上，喘着粗气，目光发直，首先产生的是小孩在失去父母时那种自私的想法：“我最早的、最有力的保护人走了，我该怎么办？”

待这种思亲的情绪消散之后，他又在房间里踱起了步，时不时会驻足看一眼那封电报。霍姆斯名义上是他父亲的助理牧师，但十多年来实际上一直都在行使着教区首席神父的职责。父亲是怎么死的？他七十五岁了，是高寿了，也算寿终正寝吧！

叫迪克感到悲伤的是，父亲去世时身边连个亲人也没有——他的妻子、兄弟姐妹全都先他一步走了。他的表亲远在弗吉尼亚，一贫如洗，没有能力到北方奔丧。这封唁电是由霍姆斯签发的。迪克爱他的父亲，遇事总要先想自己的父亲会怎么看、怎么做，然后才做出判断。迪克有两个姐姐，但在他出生前几个月就已夭折。父亲唯恐妻子会因此而娇惯他，于是便亲自担任他的道德导师，对他谆谆教导。他虽说是老来子，但并没有受到过分溺爱。

夏天，父子俩会一起到市中心去找人擦皮鞋——迪克穿一身浆得笔挺的童装水手服，他的父亲则穿剪裁得体的牧师服。对于自己英俊的小儿子，他父亲颇引以为豪。他把做人的道理不厌其烦地讲给迪克听，虽然并不是什么大道理，但很实在、很朴素，以牧师的眼光论述一个人应有的言谈举止。一次，他对迪克说：“我刚当牧师的时候，有一天去了一个陌生的小镇，走进一个挤满了人的房间，一时弄不清谁是女主人。有几个我认识的人走过来，然而我并未理睬他们，因为我见到一位灰白头发的妇人坐在房间另一头的窗户边。我走到她跟前，做了自我介绍。那以后，我在那个小镇有了许多朋友。”

他父亲那么做是因为他有一颗善良的心——父亲深知应该怎样做人。父亲是由两个可敬的寡妇抚养大的，她们让他相信，世上没有什么比良知、荣誉、礼貌和勇气更可贵的了。父亲对她们怀有深深的敬意，把她们的教诲牢记在了心里。

父亲总觉得妻子的那份薄产是属于儿子的——在迪克上大学，进入医学院学习时，他一年给迪克寄四次钱，动用的都是那份财产。他这种人，就是镀金时代[75]的人们带点扬扬得意的口吻所描述的那样：绅士风度有余，进取心不足。

……迪克叫服务员下楼去买一份报纸来，他自己仍在摊着电报纸的桌子前踱来踱去。他选定了到美国去的轮船航次，然后给身在苏黎世的尼科尔挂了电话。在等接线员接电话时，他回忆起了许多往事，真希望自己能像最初所期待的那样自始至终做一个体面的好人。





第十九章


父亲的突然去世令迪克不胜悲哀，一个小时里他都沉浸在痛苦之中，就连壮丽的祖国以及宏伟的纽约港，在他看来也具有浓浓的凄楚、忧伤的色彩。但他一上岸，这种感伤就消失了。之后，无论是在街上，在旅馆里，抑或是在火车上（那火车先是到布法罗，然后载着他父亲的遗体南下前往弗吉尼亚），这种心境都没有再出现。只有当普通列车晃晃悠悠地驶入长着低矮树木、分布着黏土层的威斯特摩兰县境内时，他才触景生情，又有了感伤的情怀。在车站，他看见了自己熟悉的那颗星星，看见了切萨皮克湾上空的那轮清冷、明亮的月亮，听见了四轮马车那吱扭吱扭的声音以及悦耳的、傻傻的乡音，听见了那些有着温和的印第安名字的古老河流的汩汩流淌声。

次日，他父亲的遗体下葬了，和上百个戴弗家族、多尔西家族以及亨特家族的亡人一道长眠在了教堂墓地里。有自己家族的亲人在身旁，父亲会非常安心的。鲜花撒放在尚未封合的棕褐色坟茔上。他觉得自己跟这儿再也没有联系了，也觉得自己不会再回来了。他跪在坚硬的土地上，想到了埋葬于此的逝者——那些人他都熟悉，熟悉他们那饱经风霜的面孔、明亮的蓝眼睛，熟悉他们那瘦削而有力的身躯，熟悉他们那在十七世纪覆盖着晦暗森林的新土地上孕育出来的灵魂。

“别了，我的父亲——别了，我所有的先人！”

踏上那罩着长长顶篷的轮船码头，他就有了人在旅途的感觉。那雾蒙蒙、泛黄的天空充满了嘈杂的人声、卡车的隆隆声、行李箱的嘎嘎声以及起重机刺耳的轧轧声，还弥漫着从大海那儿飘来的腥咸味。即便时间并不紧迫，旅客们仍行色匆匆。往事以及美洲大陆即将被置于身后，轮船那闪着亮光的入口象征着未来，而眼前那阴暗、混乱的甬道则是纷纷攘攘的现实。

踏上登船的跳板，你就会换一副眼光看世界，觉得天地变得狭小。你会觉得自己成了一个小地方的人，那地方比安道尔共和国[76]还小，对事物不再有笃定的信心。乘务长的桌子旁坐着几个人，看上去跟船舱一样怪模怪样；旅客及送行的亲友们向他们投以鄙视的目光。尖锐凄厉的汽笛声响了，船身剧烈地晃动了一下便起航了，人们的心也跟着走了。码头以及一张张面庞从旁边掠过，就好像轮船原来和码头及人群是一个整体，现在却突然分开了。轮船离人群越来越远，渐渐听不到他们的喊声了，而码头则成了水面上一个模糊不清的黑点。港口仿佛加快了速度，向茫茫的大海驶去。

艾伯特·米基思科也在这艘船上，他被报纸称为最尊贵的乘客。他现在是个大红人。他的小说模仿了当代最优秀作家的写作风格，而这并未有损于他的名声。此外，他有一种天赋，善于对借来用的东西进行婉转的处理，降低其格调，使读者读起来更轻松，于是赢得了许多读者的喜爱。事业的成功改变了他，使他变得谦虚了。他不痴不傻，知道自己的斤两……不过，他觉得自己比许多才华横溢的文人更具活力，于是便心安理得地享受靠努力挣来的荣誉。他常谦虚地对人说：“我还一无所成。我觉得自己并不具有真正的才华，不过，只要我坚持不懈地努力，就可以写出好作品来。”他从困境中崛起，一举成名！过去那数也数不清的冷嘲热讽、明枪暗箭全都被他抛在了脑后。其实，从心理角度分析，他的成功得益于他跟汤米·巴尔班的那场决斗。那场决斗虽然在他的记忆中已淡忘，但正是它在他的心里催生了一种新的自尊。

启程后的第二天，他发现了迪克·戴弗。他先是打量了迪克几眼，然后友好地做了自我介绍，在一旁坐了下来。迪克放下手中的读物，说了几分钟的话后，他便意识到米基思科身上发生了变化，以前的那种恼人的自卑感不见了，迪克乐意跟他交谈交谈。米基思科不仅谈歌德，还谈其他方面的事情，可谓“见多识广”。听他海阔天空地侃侃而谈，信手将别人的观点拿来充作自己的，还怪有意思的。他们谈得很投机，迪克还跟米基思科夫妇一起吃了几顿饭。船长曾邀请米基思科夫妇去赴宴，可是他们婉拒了，并用一种不成熟的傲慢口气告诉迪克，说他们“对那些仰慕者简直有点受不了”。

维奥莉特今非昔比，一身名牌衣服，从上到下的服饰都出自于著名服装设计师之手。如今，她醉心于一些“小发现”，借以装点门面，殊不知这样的“小发现”有教养的女性在少女时代就已经有过了。其实，她小的时候生活在博伊西[77]，本可以跟母亲学习这方面的知识，可悲的是她的魂魄已被爱达荷州的小电影院夺去了，整天泡在那里，没有时间聆听母亲的教诲。如今，她的时间是“属于”千百万其他人的——她要和他们在一起。她非常快活，但有时“天真”得过了头，会被丈夫喝止。

米基思科夫妇在直布罗陀[78]下了船。次日傍晚，迪克在那不勒斯[79]乘公共汽车从旅馆到火车站去，在车上看见了那若有所失、疲惫不堪的一家三口（两个女孩及其母亲）。他曾在船上见过她们，现在又不期而遇。他突发助人为乐之心，或者说想得到对方的倾慕，便带她们去了几个地方观光，还买红酒给她们喝，迪克高兴地看到她们开始振作起来，恢复了原有的那份自信。他曲意奉承她们，将她们看作自己心仪的女性，但由于饮酒过多，心里的这种幻象难以持久。那母女三人从始至终却将他的出现当作从天而降的好运气。夜色渐浓，他躬身告退。火车晃晃荡荡、呼哧呼哧地继续向前行驶，驶过了卡西诺和弗罗西诺内[80]。抵达罗马车站时，迪克跟她们母女进行了那种怪怪的美国式告别，然后就抵达奎里纳尔旅馆了。此时，他感到身心疲惫。

在服务台前，他突然瞪大了眼睛，抬起头来。就好像酒精在产生作用，他只觉得胃里发热，一股暖流直冲脑门。他看见了一个人，一个他跨越了地中海最愿意看到的人。

与此同时，罗斯玛丽也看见了他，还未完全认出他便先向他打了个招呼。接着，她又看了一眼，不由感到很惊讶，丢下跟她一起来的一个女孩，快步奔了过来。迪克站直身子，屏住呼吸，脸朝着她。她穿过门厅，打扮得光鲜亮丽，美艳惊人，就像一匹漂亮的小马驹，浑身用黑籽油擦得发亮，就连蹄子也亮光闪闪。迪克这才惊醒过来，但一切来得太快，使得他一时手足无措，只好尽可能掩饰起自己的疲惫之态。面对着她那双明亮的眼睛里显露出来的自信，他一时词穷，便假声假气地支吾道：“想不到啊，想不到竟在这儿遇见了你！”

她伸出两只戴着手套的手，握住他那放在柜台上的手说：“迪克……我们在拍《辉煌的罗马》……至少我们觉得是在拍这部电影，也可能随时都停拍。”

他直勾勾望着她，想叫她感到窘迫，这样就不会十分注意他的邋遢相了（胡子没刮；衣领皱巴巴，软塌塌的）。幸好她急着有事，并没有特别留意他。

只听她说：“这地方十一点钟起雾，所以我们一大早就开拍……记着下午两点给我打电话哟！”

进了自己的房间，迪克的一颗心才静了下来。他让服务员中午打电话叫醒他，然后脱掉衣服，倒在床上蒙头大睡。

服务员打电话来他也没醒，一直睡到下午两点才醒来，起床后他觉得精神焕发。他打开行李袋，把需要熨烫的西装以及需要洗的衣服送了出去，刮了脸，泡了半个小时的温水澡，然后吃了点东西。此时，阳光已经钻进了国际大道的深处。他拉开窗帘，把窗帘上的老式铜环弄得哗啦哗啦响，将阳光放了进来。他一边等送去熨烫的衣服，一边看《晚邮报》，发现上面有这样一则消息：“辛克莱·刘易斯[81]出版了长篇小说《大街》，小说描写并分析了美国某个小城市的社会生活。”后来不知怎的，他想起了罗斯玛丽。

起初，他并没有多想，只是觉得她年轻而有魅力，但托普西也年轻，也有魅力呀。他猜想她是有情人的，这四年会有不少风流韵事。人心隔肚皮，你根本无法知道你在对方的心里占有什么样的位置。不过，尽管罗斯玛丽的感情似雾气一般朦胧，他对她仍情意绵绵。真正的感情就是如此——你明明知道困难重重，仍不离不弃，渴望保持心中的那一份爱。往事悄悄地浮上了他的心头……这次，他可要抓住机会，趁着她声称愿意献出她那宝贵的躯体时一举占有她，令他人再不敢生觊觎之心。他想了想自身能够吸引她的条件，觉得已不如四年之前。那时的罗斯玛丽芳龄十八，是透过青春的迷雾看三十四岁的他；而今她二十二岁，再看三十八岁的他，就看得十分清晰、十分真切了。而且，上次相遇时，迪克尚处在情感的高峰，后来他的激情有所消退。

服务员把衣服送来后，他穿上白衬衫，系上领圈，打了条缀有一颗珍珠的黑领带，在这颗珍珠的下边约一英寸处挂着另一颗同样大小的珍珠，眼镜链子从这颗珍珠孔里穿过。睡过一觉后，他脸上又有了在里维埃拉多年消夏所留下的那种红润的紫棠色。为了恢复活力，他双手撑在椅子上倒立，口袋里的钢笔和硬币哗啦哗啦掉了出来。三点钟，他打电话给罗斯玛丽，她让他上楼去找她。做了那套杂技动作，他一时有些头晕，便在酒吧间停下来，喝了一杯金汤力[82]。

“嗨，戴弗医生！”

只是因为罗斯玛丽住在这家旅馆，迪克才能一下子认出来者是科利斯·克莱。科利斯还是那副自以为是的神态，还是那种大大咧咧的派头，只是下巴突然变得胖嘟嘟的。

“罗斯玛丽住在这儿，你知道吗？”科利斯问。

“我碰见她了。”

“我原在佛罗伦萨，听说她在这儿，所以上星期就过来了。这个‘妈妈的乖乖女’你是绝对了解不透的。”他补充道，“我是说，她是被精心呵护大的，而今却成熟了，老于世故了。希望你能明白我的意思。相信我，她把几个罗马小伙子玩得团团转，悉数收入了囊中。手段真是高明！”

“你在佛罗伦萨是上学吗？”

“我？当然，我在那儿学建筑。这次是来看赛马，星期天就回去。”

迪克好不容易才拦住他，没让他把酒钱记在自己账上。他到吧台结算时，账单看上去就像股市的报表。





第二十章


迪克下了电梯，顺着一条弯曲的走廊前行，最后听见远处有说话声，便循声来到了一个里面亮着灯的客房门前，只见午餐桌仍摆在房间里，罗斯玛丽穿一身黑睡衣，正坐在那儿喝咖啡。

“你还是那么漂亮，”他说，“比以前更漂亮了。”

“想喝咖啡吗，小伙子？”

“抱歉，今天早晨我一副邋遢相，让你见怪了。”

“你那时看上去身体不舒服……现在好了吧？想喝咖啡吗？”

“不了，谢谢。”

“你恢复得不错，今天早晨我还有点担心呢。要是摄制组留下来拍片子，我母亲下个月就过来。她老问我是否在这儿见到你了，就好像她觉得咱俩住的是隔壁似的。妈妈一直都很喜欢你，始终认为我要结交就应该结交你这样的人。”

“哦，很高兴她还记得我。”

“记得，记着呢，”罗斯玛丽语气坚定地说，“记得清清楚楚。”

“我时常看你演的电影，”迪克说，“有一次我叫人专门给我放了一场《父女情深》！”

“现在的这部片子，如果不剪裁，我的出镜率还是蛮高的。”

她从他背后走过，顺手拍了拍他的肩膀。她打电话让人把餐桌撤走，随后在一把大椅子上坐了下来。

“初次遇到你时，我还只是个小女孩，迪克。现在我是个大人了。”

“有关你的一切事情我都想听一听。”

“尼科尔怎么样？拉尼尔和托普西他们怎么样？”

“他们都很好。他们经常提起你……”

电话铃响了。她接电话时，迪克随便翻了翻房间里的两本小说——一本是埃德娜·费伯[83]写的，另一本则是艾伯特·米基思科的大作。服务员来收走了餐桌。没有了餐桌，一身黑睡衣的罗斯玛丽就更显得孤单了。

只听她冲着话筒说道：“我这儿来了个客人……不妥当，那样不太好。我得去裁缝店试衣服，得花许多时间……不行，现在不行……”

餐桌撤走后，她似乎感到轻松了，冲着迪克会心地一笑——看那笑容，就好像他们俩齐心协力排除了所有的干扰，现在总算可以安安静静待在他们的小天地里清闲一下了。

“都安排妥当了。”她说，“知道吗，我花了一个小时准备，等着你来呢！”

可就在这时，又有人给她打电话了。迪克站起来，把他的帽子从床上拿起，放到了行李架上。罗斯玛丽见了有些惊慌，忙用手捂住话筒说：“你不是要走吧？”

“不走。”

罗斯玛丽打完电话，回到了座位上。迪克恨不得能挽留住这下午流逝的时光，东一搭西一搭地说：“真希望有谁能给我补充点养料。”

“我也这么想，”罗斯玛丽附和道，“刚才打电话的那个人说他认识我的一个远房表亲。这点事竟然给人打电话！”

她把灯光调暗些，以便于谈情说爱。迪克心想：莫非她有隐情，不愿叫我仔细观察她？他跟她说话就像发信给她一样，许久才能到达她那儿。

“坐在这里，离你这么近，要想不吻你都感到困难。”于是，二人站在地板中央热吻起来。罗斯玛丽身体紧贴迪克，拉着他回到了她的椅子上。

仅仅在客厅里亲热是不够的。要么前进，要么后退。当电话又一次响起时，迪克走进了卧室，躺倒在她的床上，打开艾伯特·米基思科的小说翻看。罗斯玛丽打完电话走进来，坐在他的身边。

“你的睫毛真长。”她说。

“现在是在初中毕业舞会上，出席舞会的人中有罗斯玛丽·霍伊特小姐，她喜欢男生的眼睫毛……”

她不等他把话说完就开始吻他，而他将她拉倒在床上。二人如胶似漆，热吻起来，直吻得气喘吁吁。她的呼吸透出青春气息，显得急迫和兴奋，嘴唇有些粗糙，但嘴角柔软。

他们衣服未脱，相互搂抱，四肢缠在一起。他搂紧她，弓起背，而她扭动着脖子，胸口不断起伏着。她对他附耳低语：“别急，现在不行……这种事得慢慢来。”

他克制住自己，将汹涌的欲望收到了心房的一个角落里。不过，他仍余情缱绻地用双臂托住她，把她举得离他有半英尺高，轻轻地说：“亲爱的……这没关系。”

他仰面望着她的脸，觉得她的脸美如一轮明月，发出永恒的光辉。

“如果我们这样做的话，会有报应。”她说完，离开了他的怀抱，走到镜子跟前，用手整了整刚才被弄乱了的头发。随后，她将一把椅子拖到床跟前坐下，轻轻抚摸着迪克的脸。

“说说你的实际情况吧。”迪克说道。

“我一直说的都是实情。”

“某种程度上是这样……不过，前后衔接不到一块儿。”

他俩都哈哈大笑起来，但迪克仍要打破砂锅问到底。

“你到底是不是个处女？”他问道。

“不是，不是了！”她拿腔拿调地说，“我跟六百四十个男人睡过觉——这恐怕就是你想要的答复。”

“这不关我的事。”

“你是不是想把我当作心理学病例研究？”

“依我看，你完全是一个正常的二十二岁的女孩，生活在一九二八年，在情场上有几次艳遇也是大概率的事情。”

“的确有几次，但都无果而终了。”她说。

迪克不相信她的话，也弄不清她的意图，不知她是故意在他们之间设置障碍，还是忸怩作态，使最终委身于他显得更有分量。

“咱们到平丘山[84]走走吧。”他提议说。

他将衣服拉展，把头发抚平。一阵激情来如浪涌，逝如风。三年来，罗斯玛丽将迪克视为理想人物，以他为标准衡量其他的男人，久而久之，迪克的形象得到升华，成为英雄的形象。她不愿意让他跟别的男人一样庸俗，可谁知他却有同样苛刻的要求，似乎想占有她的某样东西，装进口袋里带走。

他们来到平丘山的草地上，漫步于天使、哲学家、农牧神的塑像及喷泉之间。她小鸟依人般挽起他的胳膊，中间调整了几次位置，就好像她一定要选好姿势，一生一世依偎在那里。她从树上摘下一根细枝，把它折断，但觉得那树枝没有什么弹性。突然，她在迪克的脸上看到了自己渴望看到的表情，于是抓起他戴着手套的手，吻了起来。随后，她孩子般跳跳蹦蹦博他欢心，他忍不住笑了，她也大笑起来。二人觉得非常快乐。

“今晚我不能同你一起出去了，亲爱的，因为我早就答应过别人，要去见他们。不过，要是你明天能起早，我可以带你去摄影地。”

迪克独自一人在旅馆吃了晚餐，早早上床睡觉，次日清晨六点半在门厅见到了罗斯玛丽。上了汽车，她坐在他身边，在朝阳下显得光彩照人、生机勃勃。他们穿过圣塞巴斯第安诺门[85]，沿着亚壁古道，到了拍摄地——在这里，仿制出的古罗马集会广场比真迹还要气派一些。罗斯玛丽把迪克交给一个男子，由他带着迪克参观那些庞大的布景——有拱门，有阶梯式座位，也有沙地竞技场。而她则去拍摄现场工作——那儿是一个囚室，里面关押基督徒囚犯。过了一会儿，迪克他俩也来到了拍摄现场，观看尼科泰拉表演（此人有望脱颖而出，成为瓦伦蒂诺[86]那样的演员）——但见他在十几个“女囚”面前昂首阔步，颐指气使，“女囚”们个个都涂了睫毛膏，露出忧伤和惊恐的眼神。

观看间，罗斯玛丽穿一件及膝的束腰宽松外衣走了过来。

“你看看这个，”她悄声对迪克说，“我想听听你的意见。每个人看了毛片都说……”

“什么是毛片？”

“就是把前一天拍摄的内容冲洗出来的胶片。他们说这是我头一次穿如此性感的衣服。”

“我倒是没注意到。”

“你当然不会注意的！可我很在意。”

穿着豹皮衣的尼科泰拉走过来，表情认真地和罗斯玛丽说话；灯光师在同导演讨论着什么，把身子一个劲儿地朝导演跟前凑。后来，导演一把将灯光师的手推开，抹了一下汗津津的额头。这时，迪克的那位向导说起了风凉话：“瞧，他又发火啦。简直莫名其妙！”

“谁？”迪克问。向导还没来得及回答，就见导演快步冲了过来。

“谁发火啦？你才发火了呢！”导演言辞激烈，谴责向导时却把脸对着迪克，仿佛在向陪审团陈述证词，“他自己是什么样，就把别人想得跟他一样。岂有此理！”他用眼睛狠狠瞪着向导，瞪了好一会儿，最后才一拍手冲大伙儿说：“好啦，各就各位！”

现场的人就像一个闹哄哄、庞杂的大家庭。一位女演员来到迪克跟前，把他错当成了一个刚从伦敦来的演员，和他神聊起来，聊了有五分钟才发现自己认错了人，于是狼狈地走掉了。电影圈子里的人在外人面前大多要么趾高气扬、不可一世，要么就是感到异常自卑（前一类人是主流）。他们勇敢、勤奋，在这么一个十年来只追求享乐的国家里为自己赢得了显赫的地位。

随着光线模糊起来，拍摄工作结束了——这样的光线适合绘画，但不适合拍摄，比不得加利福尼亚那清清爽爽的光线。尼科泰拉跟着罗斯玛丽来到汽车旁，叽叽咕咕和她耳语了几句。罗斯玛丽跟他告别时，看了他一眼，脸上无一丝笑意。

迪克和罗斯玛丽在恺撒城堡餐馆吃了午饭。这是一家豪华餐馆，设在一个带高层露台的庄园里，从那里可以俯视山下的一个集会广场遗址（那是古罗马衰落后不知哪个时期留下来的）。罗斯玛丽喝了一杯鸡尾酒和一点葡萄酒。迪克开怀痛饮，原先不快的感觉也就随之消失了。饭后，他们驱车回旅馆，两个人都脸色发红，兴致很高，心情既激动又宁静。罗斯玛丽渴望享受鱼水之乐，后来果然如愿以偿了——当初在沙滩上萌发的那带着稚气的春梦终于成了现实！





第二十一章


罗斯玛丽又要去赴宴，那是为摄制组的一个成员举办的生日宴会。迪克在门厅撞见了科利斯·克莱，但他想一个人吃饭，因而谎称在精品酒店有个约会。他同科利斯在一起喝了杯鸡尾酒，心中原来就有的一种隐隐约约的不爽，此时转为了不耐烦的情绪——他再也没有借口不回诊所上班了。这一段经历与其说是迷情，倒不如说是浪漫的记忆。尼科尔是他的女人——他经常在心里讨厌她，然而她毕竟是他的女人。同罗斯玛丽厮混是一种自我放纵——而同科利斯在一起就无聊了，什么都算不上。

他到了精品酒店，谁知在入口处却跟芭比·沃伦撞了个满怀。对方的那一对美丽的大眼睛看上去就像两块闪闪发光的钻石，直直地盯着他，又意外又好奇。“我还以为你在美国呢，迪克！尼科尔跟你在一起吗？”她说道。

“我是从那不勒斯那边回来的。”

见了他袖子上的黑纱，她说：“我听说了你的不幸，很为你感到难过。”

接下来，他们自然在一起吃了饭。“把所有的情况说给我听听。”她请求道。

迪克把实际情况述说了一番。芭比听后皱起了眉头，觉得她妹妹的生活变得如此糟糕，应该有人为此承担责任，于是说道：“多姆勒医生对她采取这样的治疗方法，你是不是觉得一开始就有问题呢？”

“可供选择的方法不是很多……当然，具体问题具体分析，对待特殊的病案得采用恰当的治疗方法。”

“迪克，我不是要指手画脚，也不想过分干涉，但你不觉得变换一下环境对她也许会有好处吗？让她离开诊所的环境，跟正常人一起生活，是不是更好一些？”

“可是，记得当初是你热衷于让她住在诊所。”他提醒她说，“你对我说，不让她住在那儿，你的心就永远也不会感到踏实……”

“此一时彼一时嘛——那时你们在里维埃拉过着隐士般的生活，住在小山上，远离众生。我并不是要你们回归那种生活，只是想叫你们换换环境，比如说到伦敦居住什么的。在这个世界上，英国人的心理是最健康的。”

“并不见得。”迪克表示了异议。

“确实如此。要知道，我对他们是很了解的。我觉得你们不妨在伦敦租一套房子，到了春天就去那里。我认识一位温和的女士，她在塔尔伯特广场有一套合适的房屋，家具齐全，你们可以租下来。我只是想让你们跟有理智、心理健康的英国人生活在一起。”

她滔滔不绝地大讲英国人的好处，全都是一九一四年宣传材料里的老生常谈，惹得迪克哈哈大笑，说道：“我在读迈克尔·阿伦[87]写的一本书，要是……”

她挥挥手中的沙拉匙，算是对迈克尔·阿伦的否定，说道：“那厮只写堕落的英国人，而我所指的是有价值的英国人。”

这就是她对她的英国朋友们的最后结论，而迪克的脑海里出现的却是另外一幅画面——一张张英国人的面孔呆滞、死板，在欧洲的小旅馆里处处可见。

“当然，这不关我的事，”芭比重申了自己的观点（其实，这只是她要进行另一番游说的序曲），“不过，让她独自一人生活在那种环境里，未免有点……”

“我去美国是因为我父亲去世了。”

“我知道，我说过我为此很难过。”她摆弄着项链上的玻璃珠子说，“不过，现在有这么多的钱，什么事都可以办得成，应该用来让尼科尔过上好日子。”

“有一点我得说明：我是不能住在伦敦的。”

“为什么不能？我觉得你在那儿工作，就跟在其他地方没什么两样。”

他往后靠一靠，打量着她，心想：如果她对尼科尔真正的病因起过疑心，怀疑到那见不得人的真相，恐怕也会视而不见，将其扔到积满灰尘的壁橱里，就如同处置一幅买错了的画一样。

后来，他们去了乌尔比亚酒吧，在那里继续谈话。科利斯·克莱来到他们的桌子旁，坐了下来。一位天才吉他手在堆满酒桶的酒吧间里一边弹奏，一边低声吟唱《歌唱吧，范法拉·米亚》。

“也许，我和尼科尔不般配，”迪克说，“她可以嫁给一个我们这一行的人，一个她认为自己能够托付终身的人，但却不是我。”

“莫非你觉得她嫁给别人会更幸福一些？”芭比突然自言自语道，“这倒可以考虑。”

后来见迪克哈哈大笑，笑得弯了腰，她才意识到自己的话是多么的离谱。

“哦，你理解我的心情。”她安慰他说道，“千万别以为我们对于你所做的一切没有感激之心。我们知道你是很不容易的……”

“千万别说这话，”他说道，“如果当初我不爱尼科尔，那就另当别论了。”

“那你现在还爱尼科尔吗？”她惊慌地问。

科利斯这时已经明白他们在说什么了。迪克急忙一转话题说：“谈点别的吧。说说你的情况吧。你为什么还不结婚？听说你同佩利爵士订了婚，就是那位……”

“哦，不谈这些。”她显得忸怩，有点闪烁其词，“那是去年的事了。”

“你们为什么不结婚呢？”迪克执拗地问。

“我不知道。我爱过的男人，一个战死疆场，另一个离开了我。”

“说给我听听。谈谈你的私生活，芭比，还有你的看法。对这一点你总是避而不谈……咱们三句话都离不开尼科尔。”

“他们俩都是英国人，是一流的英国男人。普天之下，恐怕没有比他们更理想的丈夫了。如果有，也只怪我缘分浅，没遇到过。若论这个爵士嘛，说来话长。我讨厌冗长的话头，你呢？”

“说说到底是怎么回事嘛！”科利斯说。

“我嘛……如果是有意思的话头，冗长些我也喜欢。”

“你是很有一套的，迪克，不管在何处，只要说一句话，就能叫气氛活跃起来。我觉得这可是了不起的才能。”

“那只是逢场作戏。”他轻描淡写地说。对于她的三种看法，他都显得不以为然。

“当然喽，我喜欢讲究形式，喜欢中规中矩，干什么都要高规格。我知道你可能不同意，但你也得承认这是一种老成持重的表现。”

迪克甚至不屑跟她争论。

“当然，我知道也有人会说：芭比·沃伦周游欧洲列国，有着这样那样的追求，却错过了人生中最美好的东西。但我的看法却恰恰相反——只有我和少数其他的一些人才是在追求最美好的东西。当代最有趣味的人物我都认识！”又一阵刺耳的吉他声传来，盖住了她的声音，使得她只好提高了嗓门，“我很少栽大的跟头……”

那也只是说没栽过大跟头，芭比。

她见迪克的眼神里有嘲笑的成分，便转换了话题。看来，他们俩是两股道上跑的车，不可能有共同的看法。不过，迪克觉得她还是有可敬之处的，于是把她送到精品酒店门口时，说了许多入耳的话，听得她两眼放光。

次日，罗斯玛丽坚持要请迪克吃饭。他们来到一个意大利人经营的餐馆（此人曾在美国开过店），吃了火腿、鸡蛋和华夫饼。餐后，他们回到旅馆。迪克发觉他并未爱上她，她也并不爱他，但这一发现并未削弱他对她的情欲，反而使这种情欲更加炽热。既然他明白他不会深入到她的生活中去，那她对他而言就成了一个陌生的女人。他猜想许多男人声称自己坠入了情网，恐怕指的就是这样的情况——并非心灵的痴迷，亦非五味杂陈的感情，跟他曾经对尼科尔产生过的爱是不一样的。想到尼科尔，想到她可能会死，会陷入漆黑的精神世界，会爱上别的男人，他顿觉心如刀绞。

尼科泰拉来找罗斯玛丽，在客厅里跟她谈工作上的事。后来，罗斯玛丽委婉地下了逐客令，他这才说了句俏皮话表示抗议，张狂地朝着迪克挤挤眼，悻悻地离去了。跟往常一样，电话铃又响了，罗斯玛丽接电话长达十分钟，让迪克越来越不耐烦了。

“到我的房间去吧。”他提议说。她同意了。

到了他的房间，二人躺在大沙发上，罗斯玛丽把头枕在他的膝上。他用手抚弄着她那可爱的额发，说道：“再问几句你的情况，行吗？”“你想问什么？”

“想问问你和男性交往的情况。我感到好奇，不是要说下流话。”

“你是指我认识你以后的情况？”

“说说以前的情况也可以。”

“哦，以前可没有，”她慌忙说，“以前什么情况也没有。你是我爱上的第一个男人，现在仍是唯一我真正爱的人。”她一边说，一边想着，“有那么一次，大概是在一年前吧。”

“他是谁？”

“哦，一个男人呗。”

他见她闪烁其词，就越步步紧逼。

“我敢说，我可以替你把情况讲清楚：第一次艳遇并不如意，以后便是较长的一段间隔期；第二次艳遇比较称心，但你并非打心眼里爱那位郎君；第三次艳遇顺风顺水……”

他忍受着内心的折磨，不停地说着。“后来，你遇到了真爱，一次有价值的爱，但你感到害怕了，怕的是自己拿不出什么来奉献给你最终爱上的人。”他觉得他自己越说越像一个维多利亚时代的道德君子了，“那以后，直到现在，中间又有过六七次风流韵事。是不是这样？”

她哈哈一笑，心里觉得又好气又好笑，说出了几句叫迪克宽慰的话：“一派胡言！不过，总有一天我会找到一个自己心仪的人，一旦爱上，就决不撒手。”

此时，房间里的电话响了。迪克拿起话筒，听出是尼科泰拉的声音，是找罗斯玛丽的，于是便用手捂住话筒问：“你想同他说话吗？”

她走到电话跟前，语速很快地说了一通意大利语，迪克一句也听不懂。

“这次电话打的时间可真够长的。”他说，“现在过四点了，我五点有个约会。你最好跟尼科泰拉先生去玩吧。”

“别犯傻啦。”

“我觉得，我在这里的时候，你就别跟他纠缠不清了。”

“恕难从命。”她突然提高嗓门说道，“迪克，我爱你，从来没有像爱你这样爱过任何一个别的人。可你能给我什么呢？”

“尼科泰拉又能给你什么？”

“那是两码事。”

迪克暗忖：还不都是年轻人喜欢年轻人呗！

想到这里，他嫉妒得要发疯，不愿再忍屈受辱，于是脱口说道：“他是个西班牙浑蛋！”

“他只不过是个黄口小儿。”她哼了哼鼻子说，“你知道我最爱的是你。”

听了这话，他伸手抱住她，但她有气无力地朝后沉下去。他就这样抱了她一会儿，二人的姿势就像跳芭蕾舞的收尾动作——只见她双目紧闭，头发向后垂下去，活像一个溺亡的女子。

“迪克，放开我。我这辈子心都没有这样乱过。”

此时的他就像一只好斗的公鸡，莫名其妙地生出许多醋意，全然没有了那种令她感到惬意的体贴和理解，这让她本能地要躲开他。

“我想知道真相。”他说。

“好吧。我们常在一起，他要娶我，但我不想嫁给他。够了吧？你要我怎么办？你从来没有向我求过婚。难道你要我永远跟科利斯·克莱这样的笨蛋鬼混吗？”

“你昨夜同尼科泰拉在一起吗？”

“那不关你的事，”她抽泣着说，“原谅我，迪克，你是可以过问的。你和妈妈是我在世上唯一在乎的两个人。”

“那么，尼科泰拉呢？”

“我怎么知道？”

她已经惯于闪烁其词了，就连说最不当紧的话也遮遮掩掩的。

“你对他的感情是不是就像当初在巴黎对我的一样？”

“跟你在一起时，我感到心情舒畅，感到快乐。在巴黎的时候，情况是不同的。反正你过去有过怎样的感情经历，是难以说得清的。对不对？”

他站起身来，开始准备他的晚礼服……如果他把自己经历过的痛苦和产生过的怨恨全都装在心里，那他绝不会再爱她了。

“我不爱尼科泰拉！”她宣称道，“但我明天必须跟摄制组到里窝那[88]去。唉，怎么会出这样的事呢？”她禁不住又泪如雨下，“真是倒霉。你为什么要来这儿呢？你我仅仅保留一份美好的回忆难道不好吗？跟你闹别扭，我感觉就好像和妈妈吵架一样。”

他开始穿衣服，而她站起来向门外走去。

“今晚我就不去参加聚会了。”她做出了最后的努力，“我跟你在一起，反正我也不想去参加聚会。”

他心里再起感情的浪潮，但他立刻退缩了回去。

“我回我的房间里去。”她说，“再见，迪克。”

“再见。”

“唉，真是倒霉，真是倒霉，真是倒霉！这到底是怎么回事？”

“我也考虑再三，不得其解。”

“为什么要对我这样呢？”

“我想我患了黑死病吧，”他慢吞吞地说，“似乎不能再给别人带来幸福了。”





第二十二章


饭后，奎里纳尔酒吧里还有五个客人没走。一个体面的意大利妓女坐在吧台跟前，絮絮叨叨地跟酒保攀话，后者则厌倦地哼啊哈啊地敷衍着。一个埃及人看上去像个势利小人，孤单单的，然而对那位妓女却敬而远之。酒吧里除了这几个人，再就是迪克他们两个美国客人了。

迪克对身边的环境历来都十分留意，而科利斯·克莱则浑浑噩噩地活着，感官早已变得迟钝，对于哪怕是最鲜活的事物也不闻不问。于是，他俩在一起，只是前者说，后者听（听的人就像个闷葫芦）。

迪克让下午的事情坏了心情，很想找个意大利人发泄一下，于是便东张西望，仿佛希望哪个意大利人能听见他的话跟他较真，惹出风波来。

只听他说道：“今天下午，我在精品酒店同我的大姨子一起喝茶。我们把最后一张空桌子给占了。有两个人走进来，想找一张空桌，但没有找到。其中一个人就来到我们跟前说：‘这张桌子不是给奥尔西尼公主留的吗？’我回答：‘桌子上可没有什么标志。’他说：‘但我认为它是为奥尔西尼公主留的。’我甚至连搭理都不愿搭理他。”

“后来怎么样？”

“他灰溜溜地走了。”迪克在椅子上转过身说，“我不喜欢这些人。还有一天，在一家商店门口，我让罗斯玛丽在那儿稍等一会儿。一个警察跑过去在她跟前耍怪，踅来踅去的，还不时用手碰他的帽檐。”

“这种情况我不知道。”科利斯想了想说，“我宁可待在这儿而不是待在巴黎——在巴黎，每时每刻都得当心有人偷你的钱包。”

他在这儿过得很舒心，不愿叫任何意外的情况威胁和干扰他的快乐生活，于是便重申了自己的观点。“这种情况我不知道，即使有，我也不介意。”

迪克回想起这几日在他脑海里沉浮的几件事情，不禁有点出神。一天，他到美国运通公司去，从国际大道上一家家香气扑鼻的糖果店门前走过，穿过肮脏的地下通道抵达西班牙大街，那儿有许多花店以及济慈的故居，这叫他黯然神伤。他每到一处，只对当地的人和气候感兴趣，对地方本身并不太关心（除非该地方因为发生了什么事件而具有了特殊的色彩）。罗马之所以特殊，是因为他对罗斯玛丽所怀的春梦终结于此。

一个杂役走过来，给他送来一张纸条，上面写着：“我没有去参加聚会，现在在我的房间里。明天一早我们动身去里窝那。”

迪克看后把纸条又递给了杂役，塞给他一点小费，说道：“告诉霍伊特小姐，说你找不到我。”

交代完，他就转回身跟科利斯继续说话了，提议二人一起去梆梆尼瑞夜总会放松一下。

他们看了一眼吧台前的那个卖春妇，对她的职业表现出了些许兴趣，而对方则直勾勾望着他们，满面生辉，显得很大胆。接下来，他们离开酒吧间，穿过空无一人的门厅，那儿气氛压抑，帷幔脏兮兮的，褶层里还残留着维多利亚时代的灰尘。出门时，他们朝夜间看门人点了点头，看门人则对他们点头哈腰，但一脸的苦相（值夜班的杂役都是这副嘴脸）。随后，他们乘坐出租车，穿过十一月含着潮气的夜色，沿着冷冷清清的大街驶去。街头不见女人，只有几个男子聚在冰冷的石雕旁，一个个脸色苍白，穿着黑外套，外套的领口紧扣着。

“真是的！”迪克长叹了一口气说。

“怎么啦？”

“我在想今天下午那厮的话，说什么：‘这张桌子是留给奥尔西尼公主的。’你可知这些罗马古老世家的底细？他们是强盗——罗马帝国崩溃后，他们将庙宇、宫殿据为己有，对老百姓巧取豪夺。”

“反正我是喜欢罗马的。”科利斯不为所动地说，“你为什么不去看看赛马，换换心情呢？”

“我不喜欢看赛马。”

“赛马场上美女如云……”

“我知道，反正我对这儿就是喜欢不起来。我喜欢法国，那儿人人都认为自己是拿破仑；而这儿，人人都自以为是基督。”

到了梆梆尼瑞夜总会，他们去了有护墙的歌舞厅，歌舞厅夹在冰冷的石柱中间，让人感到局促，想坐久也不能。乐队无精打采地奏起了探戈舞曲，十几对男女在宽敞的舞池里翩翩起舞，舞步精巧、轻盈，却叫美国人看不顺眼。许多服务生严阵以待，防止有人兴风作浪，即使有人故意搅局，他们也可以应对。全场表面上生机勃勃，空气中却有某种期待的气息，期待着探戈舞、茫茫的夜晚以及平衡阴阳的力量戛然而止，因为正是这些因素使得气氛凝固。来客即便有寻欢之心，在此处也不会有作乐之实。

这一点，迪克看得清清楚楚。他四处张望，希望可以看到什么有趣的事，能使自己的情绪振奋一会儿，免得坐在那儿发呆，可是他什么有趣的现象也没有看到，于是片刻之后又将目光转向了科利斯。他曾把自己最近的一些打算告诉了科利斯，但这位听众记忆力差，像个木头人一样没反应。同科利斯在一起待上半个小时，他就觉得自己锐气大减，活力剧降。

他们喝了一瓶意大利汽酒。迪克脸色发白，变得有些焦躁。他大声把乐队指挥叫过来和他说话。那指挥是个巴哈马[89]黑人，趾高气扬，看上去很难相处。二人话没说几句便吵了起来。

“是你让我过来的。”

“不错。我给了你五十里拉[90]，是不是？”

“是的。是的。是的。”

“这就对啦。我给了你五十里拉，不是吗？可你倒好，还问我要钱！”

“是你让我过来的，对不对？难道不是吗？”

“是我让你过来没错，但我已经给过你五十里拉了，是不是？”

“好吧，好吧，不说啦。”

黑人气哼哼地站起来走了，而迪克的心情更糟了。可就在这时，他瞧见大厅的另一头有个女孩在冲他笑，使得他顿觉周围的那些面色苍白的罗马人变得黯然失色，成了体面但模糊的影子。那是个英国少女，一头金发，脸色红润，妩媚动人。她又对他嫣然一笑，他心领神会，明白那是一种邀请，但这种邀请会叫有淫心的人也抛却邪念。

“这可是一见钟情。要不然，那就是我不谙风情了。”科利斯说了句调侃的话。

迪克站起来，穿过大厅向那个女孩走去。

“跳个舞好吗？”他对女孩说。

同女孩坐在一起的一位中年英国男子见状，用一种近乎道歉的语气说道：“你们跳，我马上就走了。”

迪克跳舞时由于激动，大脑倒清醒了。在女孩身上，他仿佛看到了英国种种奇观美景，听女孩清脆的声音，就像听一个讲述被大海环绕的英国乐土的故事。他后仰着端详她，说着掏心窝的话，兴奋得声音发抖。女孩许诺说等那位陪她的中年男子一离开，她就去找他一起坐坐。她回到自己的座位时，那位英国人满脸堆笑，一再地表示歉意。

迪克回到他和科利斯的桌子那儿，又要了一瓶起泡酒。

“她看上去像个电影演员，就是想不起来是谁了。”他说道，一边说一边还焦急地回过头朝身后看了看，“怎么还不见她来呢？”

“我也想去拍电影。”科利斯若有所思地说，“家里指望我继承父亲的生意，可我兴趣不大。要在伯明翰[91]的办公室里待上二十年……”

他的声音里有一种抵触的因素，不愿屈服于物质文明的压力。

“是不是大材小用了？”迪克说。

“不，不是这个意思。”

“你就是这个意思。”

“我心里究竟怎么想，你怎么会知道？既然你如此热爱工作，何不开业当医生？”

话不投机，两个人都有点丧气。不过，由于喝酒喝得迷迷糊糊，他们不一会儿就把不愉快忘掉了。科利斯起身告辞，二人热情地握别。

“好好想一想。”迪克以智者的语气说。

“好好想什么？”

“你心里有数。”迪克的忠言显然指的是要科利斯继承他父亲的生意。

科利斯走后，迪克喝光了瓶里的酒，接着又和那个英国女孩跳起了舞，僵硬的身子摇摇晃晃，他大胆地转圈，舞步踉跄。后来，最不可思议的现象突然出现了——他正跟女孩跳舞，音乐却戛然而止，女孩随之从人间蒸发了！

“你见到她了吗？”

“见到谁呀？”

“就是跟我跳舞的女孩。怎么就突然不见啦！肯定到那个房间里去了。”

“你别去，别去！那是女洗手间！”

迪克听了，就站在吧台那儿没动。吧台跟前还有两个人。他有意攀谈，却又不知从哪儿说起。他可以尽自己平生所学讲一讲罗马的历史以及科隆纳和加埃塔尼家族的发家劣迹，但又觉得一上来就说这些未免有些唐突。这时，雪茄烟柜台上放着的几个玩具娃娃突然倒下来掉在了地板上，引起了一阵慌乱。他潜意识里觉得是自己惹的祸，于是赶紧开溜，回到歌舞厅，在那儿喝了一杯清咖啡。科利斯走了，那个英国女孩也不见了，看来他只好乖乖地回旅馆去，带着忧伤的心情上床睡觉了。他付过账，拿起了他的帽子和外套。

外面，路边阴沟里以及高低不平的鹅卵石路面上积着脏水，从坎帕尼亚大区升起湿漉漉的水汽，仿佛是消亡的罗马文明留下的汗渍，玷污了清晨的空气。四个出租车司机围了上来，他们的小眼睛骨碌碌乱转，眼袋发黑。其中的一个直朝他跟前凑，被他不客气地一把推开。

“到奎里纳尔旅馆多少钱？”

“一百里拉。”

一百里拉等于六美元！他摇摇头，还价三十里拉，这已是白天价钱的两倍了，但那几个司机耸耸肩，走开了，像是约好了一样。

“最多不超过三十五里拉。”他语气肯定地说。

“一百里拉。”

他突然说起了英语。“不就半英里吗？把我送过去，给你四十里拉。”

“不行，送不成。”

他已经非常疲倦了，于是便拉开一辆出租车的车门钻了进去。

“去奎里纳尔旅馆！”他对倔强地站在窗外不动的司机说道，“别冲我冷笑！快送我去奎里纳尔旅馆！”

“没门！”

迪克下了车。这时，有人在夜总会门前和出租车司机理论，另有一人过来向迪克解释他们的情况；一个司机凑到跟前，一边说话一边打着手势。迪克将他推开说：“我要去奎里纳尔旅馆。”

“他说要一百里拉。”有人充当翻译说。

“我知道。我给他五十里拉。走开。”这最后一句话是冲着又一个凑上来的司机说的。这人看了看他，鄙夷地吐了一口唾沫。

一个星期以来郁积在迪克心头的焦躁和愤怒一下子爆发了出来，犹如火山喷发，而他的祖国赋予他的荣誉感和传统的力量起到了推波助澜的作用。只见他冲上前，扇了那人一巴掌。

众人见了，一拥而上，又叫又嚷，挥舞着拳头，把他逼到了墙角。迪克背靠墙，笨拙地挥拳还击，脸上还挂着笑。一场演戏一般的全武行在大门前展开了，你推我一下，我搡你一下，击打的动作虚虚实实，实实虚虚，进行了好几分钟。后来，他脚下一滑摔倒在地，把身子的某个地方摔伤了，但他站起来继续打斗。不过，那些人突然退了回去。随后，一个人开始说话了，对他大加斥责，而他背靠墙，气喘如牛，因为自己蒙受的屈辱而怒不可遏。看得出没人同情他，但他绝不相信自己是这场斗殴的引发者。

他们一起到警察局去解决这场纠纷。他的帽子被人找回来还给了他，有人轻轻搀着他的胳膊。他跟着出租车司机们绕过一个街角，走进一幢没有什么家具的房屋，里面亮着一盏昏暗的灯，灯下有几个警察在休息。

办公桌前坐着一位警长。一个在斗殴期间曾劝过架的热心人用意大利语对他详细讲述了事情的经过，中途不时用手指指迪克，而那几个司机则趁机对迪克骂上几声，谴责几句。警长点着头，显得很不耐烦，最后摆摆手叫停了对方那让人摸不着头脑的讲述（讲述人在收尾处又慷慨激昂地说了几句）。警长冲着迪克问道：“会讲意大利语吗？”

“不会。”

“会讲法语吗？”

“会。”迪克余怒未消地回答。

“那好，你听着。快给我回奎里纳尔旅馆睡觉去。听着，你喝醉了。就按司机的要价给钱吧。你听懂了吗？”

戴弗摇摇头说：“不，我不愿意。”

“为什么？”

“我只付四十里拉。这够多了。”

警长站起身来。

“听着！”他恶狠狠地高声说道，“你喝醉了，动手打了司机。就这样吧。”他情绪激动地挥了一下右手，又挥了一下左手，“我不追究你的责任就算对你客气的了。司机要一百里拉，就给他一百里拉！快回奎里纳尔旅馆去吧！”[92]

迪克觉得受到了侮辱，不由怒从心头起，恶向胆边生，狠狠瞪了警长一眼。

“那好吧。”他转身头也不抬地朝门口走去，而那个把他带到警察局来的便衣斜眼看他，摇头晃脑的。“叫我回去我就回吧！”他嚷嚷道，“不过，我得先收拾了这小子再走。”

他走过那个斜眼看他的家伙身边时，一挥左拳向那张奸笑的脸打去，重重击在了那家伙的下巴上，将他打翻在地。

他站在那家伙的跟前，又快活又得意。可是，甚至还没等他明白自己究竟做了什么，就感到一阵天旋地转——他被警棍击倒，接着拳头和皮靴便雨点般落在了他身上。他感到自己的鼻梁被打断了，就像瓦片被击碎了一样，眼睛被砸进了眼窝里，仿佛橡皮筋弹了进去，一根肋骨也被踢断了。一时间，他失去了知觉，后来被人拉起坐在那儿，两只手腕被咔嚓铐在一起时，才苏醒了过来。他机械地挣扎着站了起来，而那个被他打倒的便衣警官站在不远处，用手帕擦了擦下巴，看有没有出血。接着，那家伙朝迪克走过来，站稳身子，挥起拳头，一拳将他打倒在地。

这位戴弗医生直挺挺地躺着，被人用一桶水兜头浇在了身上。后来，有人抓住他的手腕将他拖走时，他睁开一只眼睛，透过血红色的雾团，模模糊糊地辨认出了一个出租车司机那可怖的面孔。

“快到精品酒店去，”他有气无力地叫道，“去告诉沃伦小姐一声。我给你两百里拉！去告诉沃伦小姐，给你两百里拉！呸，你们这些肮脏小人……你们这些……”

他哽咽着，啜泣着，眼睛透过血红色的雾团望着，但没人理会他，只是一个劲儿地把他拖着走。他被拖过坑洼不平的地面，被拖进一间小屋，被扔在了石头地上。所有的人都出去了，房门哐当一声关上了，把他孤零零一个人关在了里面。





第二十三章


芭比·沃伦直至深夜仍未入眠，躺在床上读马里昂·克劳福德[93]的一本异常单调乏味的有关罗马的小说。到了一点钟，她下床来到窗口，俯瞰下面的街道。在旅馆对面，有两个警察，身披斗篷，头戴马戏团小丑那样的帽子，模样很古怪。他们不停地走来走去，身上的斗篷鼓起，犹如两面飘动的帆。看着他们，她不由想起午餐时那个盯着她看的禁卫军军官。那人在低矮的意大利人中鹤立鸡群，显得高大威猛，并以此而自负（该军官除此之外似乎别无其他长处）。假如那人当时走到她跟前说：“你我交个朋友，好吗？”她一定会乐得回答：“为什么不呢？”至少此刻她有这样的想法，因为她仍然对环境不熟，觉得自己是孤家寡人。

她的思绪慢慢从那个禁卫军军官转到眼前的这两个警察上，接着又飘向迪克……最后，她回到床上，熄了灯。

将近四点，她被一阵急促的敲门声惊醒。

“来了……什么事？”

“我是看门的，夫人。”

她披上她的和服式女晨衣，开了门，睡眼惺忪地看着来人。

“你的一个叫戴弗的朋友出事了，得罪了警察，被关在了监狱里。他让一个出租车司机来送信。司机说他答应给自己两百里拉的辛苦费。”说到这里，看门人谨慎地停顿了一下，以期得到芭比的认可，“司机说戴弗先生闯下了大祸，和警察大打出手，伤得十分严重。”

“我马上下去。”

她心里像有十五个吊桶在打水，七上八下的，手忙脚乱地穿戴停当，十分钟后下了电梯，走进黑乎乎的门厅。送信的司机已经走了，看门人另叫来一辆出租车，把监狱的地址告诉了司机。芭比上路时，车窗外的夜色已逐渐消退，天空朦胧一片。她的神经几乎还没有苏醒过来，迷迷糊糊弄不清现在是夜里还是白天。她开始和晨曦赛跑——有时，汽车驶上宽阔的大街，她就占上风；然而，一旦遇到阵风刮来，疾驶的汽车速度减慢，落后一步的晨曦便会追上来。汽车经过一处哗哗作响的喷泉时，但见一大片阴影里水花飞溅。后来，汽车拐进一条弯弯曲曲的小巷，两边的房屋也随之变了模样，或高或矮，千奇百怪。汽车在鹅卵石路上颠簸前行，轮胎嘎吱嘎吱地响。最后，汽车在一个地方猛地停下来——这儿有两座岗亭，亮着灯光，后边是一道幽暗潮湿的绿墙。突然，从泛着紫色的黑魆魆的拱门那儿传来了迪克大吼大叫的声音：“这儿有英国人吗？有美国人吗？有没有英国人？有没有……啊，上帝呀！你们这些肮脏的意大利人！”

他的喊声一落，就响起了沉闷的砸门的声音。随后又是他的大吼大叫：“这儿有美国人吗？有英国人吗？”

芭比循声跑了过去，穿过拱门进了一座院子。在院子里，她一时不知该往哪个方向去，随即看到一个小小的禁闭室，而迪克的叫喊声就是从那里传来的。两个警卫见了她不禁一愣，她没理他们，风一样从他们身边冲过，直奔禁闭室的房门。

“迪克！”她叫道，“这是怎么回事？”

“他们把我的眼睛打瞎了。”他高声吼道，“他们给我戴上手铐，然后就殴打我，这些该死的……这些……”

芭比不听则已，听后气得猛然转过身冲到那两个警卫跟前。

“你们对他干了些什么？”她怒气冲冲地低声问道。警卫见她凶神恶煞，吓得不禁矮了半截，畏怯地说：“我们听不懂英语。”[94]

她用法语破口大骂，尽情发泄着胸中的愤怒，骂得他们身子直朝后缩，恨不得找个地缝钻进去。“赶快给我放人！赶快给我放人！”她吼道。

“没有命令，我们也没办法。”

“哼！岂有此理！”

暴怒之下，芭比又发了一通火，骂得警卫连声道歉说他们没有放人的权力，同时面面相觑，意识到问题已非常严重。芭比回到禁闭室门前，靠上前去，身子几乎紧贴在门上，仿佛是想让迪克感受到她的存在和力量。只听她大声说道：“我要到大使馆去，马上就回来。”接着，她最后朝警卫狠狠地瞪了一眼，便风风火火地走了。

她乘出租车到了美国大使馆，按司机要的价付了车费。此时，天还黑着。她跑上台阶，摁了门铃。她连摁三次，才见一个睡眼惺忪的英国门房给她开了门。

“我要见人，”她说，“随便哪一个都行……不过要快。”

“都在睡觉呢，夫人，大使馆九点才开门。”

她心急如焚，哪里管什么时候开门，只顾说道：“事关重大！一个美国人遭到了毒打，被关进了意大利的监狱！”

“都在睡觉呢，九点才……”

“我等不及了。他们把一个美国人的眼睛都打瞎了——那可是我的妹夫！他们把他关在牢里不放他出来。我必须向大使馆反映……你难道听不懂吗？难道你是疯了吗？看你一副傻傻的样子站在那里，莫非你是白痴？”

“我无能为力，夫人。”

“你去把人叫醒。”她揪住他的肩膀，用力晃了一下，“这可是人命关天的事。要是你不去把人叫醒，叫你吃不了兜着走！”

“请你放尊重一点，别碰我，夫人。”

这时，门房的身后飘来一个无精打采的带有格罗顿[95]口音的声音。“怎么回事呀？”

门房松了口气，回答道：“这里有位女士求见，她推了我一把。”

门房说话时朝后退了几步，而芭比从他身边冲过，进了大厅。只见在上面的楼梯口站着一个奇特的年轻男子，显然刚被吵醒。他身上裹着一件绣花的白色波斯睡袍，脸上涂了一种粉红色的、看起来很鲜艳的东西，显得怪模怪样，不光不自然，还很难看。而且他嘴上套了样东西，像是牲畜套了口衔。他看见芭比过来，急忙把头朝后一缩，躲进了黑影里。

“怎么回事呀？”他又重复了一遍刚才的提问。

芭比情绪激动地开始讲述，一边向楼梯那儿挪步。在讲述的过程中，她才看清他嘴上的“口衔”其实是胡须套，而他脸上涂的则是粉红色的面霜。芭比说的事，在他听来简直就是噩梦。末了，芭比语调激愤，高声要求他立刻跟她一起去监狱，把迪克救出来。

“此事很棘手呀。”他说道。

“是很棘手。”芭比顺着他的意思说道，“那该怎么办？”

“这事要和警察局打交道。”他的声音里有了一丝官腔，“领事馆九点钟开门之前，恐怕什么办法也没有。”

“要等到九点！”她惶恐地说，“你一定会有办法的！你可以跟我一起到监狱去，让他们别再伤害他嘛。”

“我们是无权这样做的。这种事由领事馆处理，而领事馆九点办公。”

他的脸由于罩着胡须套，显得无动于衷，这一下子激怒了芭比。

“我不能等到九点。我的妹夫说他的眼睛被打瞎了，伤得很严重！我必须到他那儿去，必须找个医生。”她情绪激动，边说边愤怒地嘤嘤哭起来——她知道光说不顶用，得用哭声打动他，“你一定得采取行动，因为你有责任保护遇到麻烦的美国公民。”

但他是东海岸人，天生一副硬心肠。他见她不理解他的难处，便耐着性子摇了摇头，将身上的波斯睡袍裹紧些，朝下走了几级楼梯，吩咐门房说：“你给这位夫人写一下领事馆的地址，再查一下科拉佐医生的住址和电话号码，也写给她。”吩咐完，他转向芭比，换上一副基督生气时的那种表情，说道：“尊敬的女士，大使馆代表美国政府处理同意大利政府之间的事务，除非有国务院的特别指示，否则是不负责保护公民的。你的妹夫触犯了这个国家的法律，被送入监狱，这就如同一个意大利人被送进纽约监狱一样。能放他出来的只有意大利法庭。要是你的妹夫打官司，你可以到领事馆去寻求帮助和忠告，因为他们负责保护美国公民的正当权利。领事馆要到九点才办公。即使是我的亲兄弟，我也无能为力……”

“你能给领事馆打个电话吗？”芭比插话说。

“领事馆的事务我们是不能干涉的。领事九点到那儿……”

“你能告诉我他的住址吗？”

他沉吟片刻，然后摇了摇头，接过门房写好了领事馆地址的便笺递给她说：“就这样吧。恕我不能奉陪了。”

他把她送到门口时，紫色的晨曦刹那间猛然照射在了他那像戴着粉红色面具一般的脸上，照在他那用来护须的亚麻套子上。他走后，只剩下了芭比一个人孤零零地站在大使馆门前的台阶上——她在大使馆里才待了十分钟。

大使馆外的广场上空荡荡的，只有一位老人在用一根带尖的棍子捡烟头。芭比拦了辆出租车去领事馆，但那里没有人，只有三个可怜兮兮的女清洁工在擦洗楼梯。她向她们打听领事的住址，但她们怎么也听不懂她的话。她忧心如焚，情急之中冲了出去，让司机送她去监狱。司机不知道监狱在哪儿，于是她就用“往前开”、“朝右拐”和“向左转”这样的话语为司机指路，总算到了监狱附近的一个地方。她下了车，在一条条迷宫一般但又眼熟的小巷里摸来摸去（这一带的房屋和小巷看上去都一个样）。后来，她从一条小巷摸出来，到了西班牙广场上，看见了美国运通公司的招牌。见了招牌上的“美国”两字，她精神为之一振。公司的窗口有灯光，于是她快步跑过广场，推了推门，但门锁着，屋里的时钟就在这时敲响，七点钟了。猛然间，她想起了科利斯·克莱。

她还记得他下榻的那家旅馆的名称——该旅馆是位于精品酒店对面的一幢别墅式房屋，里面铺着红地毯，闷得叫人透不过气来。值班的女服务员不愿帮她的忙，声称自己无权打搅克莱先生，也拒绝让这位“沃伦小姐”孤身一人上楼去他的房间。最后，在盘问清楚这并不是一桩风流案，她这才陪芭比上了楼。

科利斯赤条条躺在床上。昨夜回旅馆时，他喝得酩酊大醉，此时被叫醒后过了一会儿才意识到自己竟然一丝不挂。为此，他感到十分难为情，抓起衣服跑进了浴室，一边手忙脚乱地穿戴，一边喃喃自语：“糟糕，我这副样子肯定被她看得一清二楚。”接下来，他打了几个电话，弄清了那家监狱的地址，然后和芭比一道赶了去。

禁闭室的门开着，迪克歪坐在警卫室的一把椅子上。警卫已洗去了他脸上的一部分血污，刷过他的衣服，并给他戴上了帽子遮住伤口。

芭比来到门口，浑身发着抖说：“克莱先生在这里陪你，我要去见领事，再请个医生来。”

“好吧。”

“待着别动。”

“好吧。”

“我马上回来。”

她乘出租车赶到领事馆时已过了八点钟，那儿的人让她在接待室等候。快九点时，领事姗姗而至。芭比累极了，难以抑制自己的情绪，硬是耐着性子把来因讲了一遍。领事显得很不安，警告她说在人生地不熟之处千万不可打架斗殴。但他更为在意的是，芭比应该在外边等候才对。从他圆滑的眼睛里，芭比绝望地看出领事的推托，他压根就不想介入这个事件。在等待答复时，她打电话给迪克请了一位医生。在接待室里等候的其他人一个接一个被叫进了领事的办公室。芭比等了半个小时也没见叫她，于是她便趁着有人出来的时候，硬是从秘书身边挤进了办公室。

“简直太不像话了！一个美国人被人打个半死，还被关进了监狱，而你不采取任何措施去帮助他。”

“稍等一下，夫人……”

“我等得够久了。你得马上去监狱把他救出来！”

“夫人……”

“我们在美国也是有头有脸的人……”她说着说着语气越加强硬起来，“要不是怕闹出丑闻来，我们就……我要把你这种冷漠态度报告给有关部门。我妹夫要是英国公民，恐怕早就从监狱里放出来了。你倒好，处处为那些警察考虑，全然不顾你自己应尽的责任。”

“夫人……”

“戴上你的帽子，马上跟我走！”

一听说让他戴上帽子跟着走，领事有点慌神，又是擦眼镜又是乱翻桌上的文件，以掩饰内心的不安。而这些动作没有一点用处，眼前的这位美国女子哪管这些，气势汹汹地站在那儿，发着她那排山倒海般令人无法理喻的脾气——正是这种脾气摧折了一个民族的道德脊梁，把美洲大陆变成了幼儿园。领事哪里招架得住，急忙按铃叫来了副领事——芭比赢了！

迪克坐在警卫室里，阳光从窗户倾泻进来，洒在他的身上。科利斯和那两个警卫守在他身旁，大家都在等待着，看事情会有什么结果。迪克用肿得成了一条缝的眼睛看看警卫——那两人都是托斯卡纳[96]的农家子弟，上嘴唇短小，很难把他们同昨晚的残暴行为联系起来。他叫一个警卫去给他端杯啤酒来。

一杯酒落肚，他觉得晕乎乎的，回想起昨天的事情，觉得很有讽刺意味，叫人啼笑皆非。科利斯认为那个英国女孩跟此事不无关联，而迪克则语气坚定地说事情发生之前那女孩早已不见了踪影。科利斯也有自己的心事，仍在为清晨那一幕焦虑，觉得沃伦小姐肯定看见了他一丝不挂睡在床上的窘相。

迪克的愤怒稍稍平息了些，觉得任何一方都不应该追究刑事责任。此事对他的打击太大了，除非彻底忘记，否则就无法摆脱这个阴影。然而，要忘记是不可能的，这叫他的心沉入谷底。从此以后，他将成为一个完全不同的人。此时此刻，他怪念丛生，真不知自己将会变成一个什么样的人。此事似乎不是人为，而是上帝一手安排的。一个成年的雅利安人是不可能从屈辱中获益的——他一旦决定采取宽恕的态度，屈辱就成了他生命中的一部分，而他本人就和使他蒙受屈辱的一方成了一体。这样的结局简直匪夷所思！

科利斯说此仇不报非君子，而迪克摇摇头，没吱声。一个警察中尉走进了警卫室，制服笔挺，皮靴锃亮，脚步嗵嗵响，就像来了一群人一样。两个警卫急忙立正站定。中尉拿起那个空酒瓶，把他的部下骂得狗血喷头。一怒之下，他把酒瓶从警卫室扔了出去。迪克看看科利斯，哈哈大笑了起来。

领事馆的副领事是个劳累过度的年轻人，名叫斯旺森。他来后，大家一块儿到法庭去——科利斯和斯旺森走在迪克的两边，那两个警卫紧跟在后面。这是一个天色发黄、雾气腾腾的上午，广场上以及两边的拱廊里人头攒动。迪克拉低帽檐遮住脸，加快脚步朝前走，弄得其中的一个短腿的警卫一路小跑才跟得上，气得他直报怨。斯旺森出面做了调停。

“我让你们丢脸了，是不是？”迪克语气轻松地说。

“跟意大利人打架，弄不好你会被打死的。”斯旺森有些窘迫地回答，“这次他们也许会放过你，但你要是一个意大利人，可能会在牢里待上几个月。就这么回事！”

“你坐过牢吗？”

斯旺森哈哈一笑。

“我喜欢他，”迪克对科利斯说，“他是个非常讨人喜欢的年轻人，给别人提的忠告很有价值。不过，我敢打赌，他自己也坐过牢，非但坐过，恐怕还曾经坐过很长时间。”

斯旺森又是哈哈一笑，说道：“我只是想让你谨慎点，因为你根本不了解那是些什么人……”

“哼，我了解他们是什么人，”迪克气愤地打断他的话说，“他们都是些该死的王八蛋。”说完，他还转向警卫问：“你们听懂我的话了吗？”

“我就把你送到这儿了，”斯旺森急忙说，“我对你大姨子说过就送你到这里……我们的律师在楼上的法庭等你。说话谨慎为妙。”

“再见。”迪克客气地同他握手说，“非常感谢你。我相信你一定会鹏程万里……”

斯旺森又是一笑，急匆匆走了，脸上又换上了官场上的那种拒人于千里之外的表情。

迪克他们一行来到了一个院子里，四面都有露天楼梯通向上面的审判庭。当他们踏着石板路穿过院子时，聚集在那儿的人群发出一片嘘声和叫骂声，声音里充满了愤怒和轻蔑。迪克不解地看看四周。

“怎么回事？”他惊恐地问。

一个警卫对人群说了些什么，那片嘘声便消失了。

随后，他们走进了审判庭。领事馆派来的一位衣着不整的意大利律师在跟法官说话，一直说个没完，而迪克和科利斯就在旁边等着。一个懂英语的人刚才从窗口观察院子里的情况，这时走过来对迪克解释了他们穿过院子时那些人嘘他的原因。原来，弗拉斯卡蒂[97]的一个本地人奸杀了一个五岁的女童，今天上午要被押来受审，院子里的人把迪克错当成了那个凶犯。

几分钟后，律师告诉迪克，说他自由了——法庭认为他已受到了足够的惩罚。

“足够的惩罚！”迪克叫了起来，“凭什么受惩罚？”

“走吧，”科利斯说，“你现在争辩是没有用的。”

“我只不过跟几个出租车司机打了一架，何罪之有？”

“他们指控你走近一个警探时，假装要跟他握手，却突然袭击了他……”

“这不属实！我告诉过他我要揍他——我并不知道他是警探。”

“你最好还是走吧。”律师催促道。

“走吧。”科利斯挽住他的胳膊，拉他下了楼梯。

“我有话要说，”迪克喊道，“我要对这些人讲一讲，我是怎样奸污那个五岁女童的。也许我……”

“走吧。”

芭比和一位医生在出租车里等着。迪克不想看到她，也不喜欢那个医生——此人板着面孔，让人觉得他是一个令人最难捉摸的欧洲人，一个拉丁民族的道德家。迪克在讲述这场飞来横祸时，其他人都缄口不语。到了奎里纳尔旅馆他的房间里，医生为他清洗了残留的血污和汗渍，校正了他的鼻梁，给折断的肋骨和脱臼的手指复了位，为一些小伤口消了毒，给受伤的那只眼缠了纱布。迪克向他要了四分之一格令[98]的吗啡，因为他精神亢奋，难以入眠。他服了吗啡后就睡着了。医生和科利斯离开了，而芭比留下来守候，要等英国疗养院的护士来了再走。尽管这一夜过得很不容易，她心里却有一种满足感，觉得不管迪克以前怎么样，起码现在她们在道德层面占了优势——只要迪克还有一点用，她们在他面前就会一直保持这种优势。

第三篇


第一章


凯绥·格雷戈罗维斯夫人在他们家别墅的小径上紧走几步赶上了她丈夫。

“尼科尔怎么啦？”她语气轻松地问，但由于喘息未定就发问，说明她跑过来时心里就在想这个问题。

弗朗茨诧异地看了看她。

“尼科尔没事。你干吗问这个，亲爱的？”

“你老去看她——我想她肯定是病了。”

“咱们回家再说吧。”

凯绥顺从地点点头。他在办公楼的工作已经结束，而孩子们跟他们的家庭教师在客厅里，于是夫妻俩上楼去了卧室。

“对不起，弗朗茨，”没等丈夫说话，凯绥便先开了口，“对不起，亲爱的，我不该那么问。我明白我的职责，并为这种职责感到自豪。不过，我和尼科尔之间有一种隔膜。”

“同巢之鸟应该和睦相处！”弗朗茨大声叫道。随后，他觉得这样的腔调与自己所要表达的感情不合拍，于是就换上了一种一字一顿、抑扬顿挫的语调将刚才的话又重复了一遍：“同——巢——之——鸟——应——该——和——睦——相——处！”他老师多姆勒医生惯用这种语调说话，让最无聊的陈词滥调也显得大有深意。

“这我知道。你没见过我对尼科尔有失礼之处吧？”

“我看你是缺乏常识。尼科尔是半个病人，也许终生都要跟病魔做斗争。迪克不在的时候，我有责任照顾她。”说到这里，他有些犹豫，停顿了一下才又说了下去，因为有时他觉得不该说的事情还是不要告诉凯绥为好，“今天上午从罗马来了封电报——迪克得了流感，他明天启程回来。”

凯绥松了口气，接着就用一种比较平缓的语气继续说道：“我觉得尼科尔病得并不像人们所想的那么厉害——她只是以此作为幌子显示自己的能力。她真应该去演电影，就像你所欣赏的诺玛·塔尔梅奇[1]那样——所有的美国女子都乐于上银幕。”

“电影里的诺玛·塔尔梅奇也让你吃醋啦？”

“反正我就是不喜欢美国人。他们自私，太自私了！”

“你喜欢迪克吗？”

“我喜欢他，”她承认道，“他与众不同，遇事老替别人着想。”

弗朗茨心想：“诺玛·塔尔梅奇也是一样的。她不仅艳压群芳，还必定是个温文尔雅、品格高尚的人。她出演庸俗的角色，一定是受到了导演的强迫。如果能结识这样一个女子，那真是三生有幸！”

他们曾在苏黎世看过诺玛·塔尔梅奇演的电影，回家的路上，凯绥就像一个打翻了的醋坛子，把一个明明生动的形象说得一无是处。而今，她对诺玛·塔尔梅奇的那股醋意早已不见了。

“迪克娶尼科尔是看上了她的钱，”只听她说道，“那是他的弱点……记得有天夜里，你好像也透露出了这样的意思。”

“你这是血口喷人。”

“我不该这么说，”她连忙改了口，“正如你所言：同巢之鸟应该和睦相处！可是，尼科尔那个样子，就难跟她和睦相处了——她见了我就把身子往后缩，似乎还屏住呼吸，就好像我身上有臭味一样！”

凯绥说的是实情。她操持家务，生活节俭，很少给自己买衣服穿。就连美国的女店员一夜也要换洗两套内衣，她们也会留意到凯绥身上散发出的隔天的汗酸味——确切地说，那是一种表象，是凯绥劳作不休、体质变差所产生的类似氨水的味道。弗朗茨对此已习以为常，就像闻凯绥的头发散发出的浓浓的气味一样，要是闻不到，还会想念呢。尼科尔则不然——她讨厌为她穿衣服的护士手上的气味，自然也就不愿忍受凯绥身上的气味了。

“还有呢，”凯绥继续发着牢骚，“她不愿让他们家的孩子跟咱们的孩子一起玩……”

弗朗茨听够了，于是便说道：“你应该管住你的嘴！这种话会毁了我的事业，因为我们靠了尼科尔的钱才有了这家诊所。咱们吃饭吧。”

凯绥意识到她这番发作实在欠妥，但弗朗茨的最后一句话倒提醒了她，让她觉得美国人财大气粗，可以胡作非为。一个星期后，她对尼科尔的不满找到了新的发泄口。

当时，迪克回来，他们设宴为他接风。宴后，戴弗夫妇的脚步声刚刚从小径上消失，她就关上房门，对弗朗茨说：“你看见他的眼圈了吗？他可太放纵了！”

“别说得那么难听。”弗朗茨谴责道，“迪克一回家就把事情告诉了我。他在横渡大西洋的轮船上玩了玩拳击。在这些横渡大西洋的轮船上常有美国乘客参加拳击活动。”

“这话我能相信吗？”她哼了哼鼻子说，“他的一条胳膊一动就叫疼，太阳穴的一处伤口还没有愈合——你可以看见那儿的头发被剪掉了。”

弗朗茨可没有注意到这些细节。

“难道不蹊跷吗？”凯绥问道，“难道你会认为这种情况能给诊所增光添彩吗？今晚我闻到他身上有一股酒气——他回来后，我已多次闻到他酒气熏天了。”

说到这里，她把语速放慢，以显示她所说的情况是十分严重的。“迪克不再是个生活严肃的人了。”

弗朗茨耸耸肩上了楼，不愿再听她喋喋不休的指责。到了卧室，他转向她说：“他当然是个生活严肃的人，还是个才华横溢的人。近来在苏黎世取得神经病理学学位的大有人在，而他被认为是最有才华的——他叫我一辈子都望尘莫及。”

“丢脸！”

“这是明摆着的事实——不承认这一点才丢脸呢。每当遇到疑难病例，我就去请教迪克。他的著作在精神病学领域一直都是经典——到医学院的图书馆一问便知。莘莘学子大多以为他是英国人——他们不相信如此完美的经典之作会出自一个美国人之手。”他啧啧赞叹，随手从枕头下面取出睡衣来，“我不明白你为什么要说这样的话，凯绥——我以为你是喜欢他的。”

“丢脸！”凯绥说，“你是实干家，事情都是你做的。这是一场龟兔赛跑的游戏——依我看，兔子也快输了。”

“行啦！行啦！”

“好吧，好吧。这是实际情况嘛。”

他叉开五指，把手用力往下一挥。

“别说了！”

夫妻俩的这场谈话犹如一场辩论，他们各抒己见，针锋相对。末了，凯绥承认自己不该过于苛责迪克——她毕竟是崇拜和敬畏迪克的，而迪克对她也很欣赏，很理解。至于弗朗茨，妻子的话渐渐被淡忘于时间的长河里，但从那以后他再也不觉得迪克是个生活严肃的人了。随着时间的推移，他越发觉得自己从来就不认为迪克是个生活严肃的人。





第二章


迪克把罗马的那场灾难经过修订后告诉了尼科尔——按他的版本，他是路见不平，为了救一位喝醉了酒的朋友才惹祸上身的。他相信芭比·沃伦会管住她的舌头，因为他提前给她打过预防针，说过尼科尔如果知道了真相会产生什么样灾难性的后果。不过，这些跟以后这次事件对他造成的持久性影响相比较，就是小巫见大巫了。

作为对那件事的一种反应，他全力以赴地埋头工作，弗朗茨就是想跟他分道扬镳，也苦于找不到借口和理由。他们的友谊是真正的友谊，如果不发生令人痛至骨髓的事件，是不可能说完就完的。所以，弗朗茨宁可相信，而且越来越坚信，他之所以感到不安和烦恼，只是因为迪克的智商太高、感情太浪漫而已——他们俩之间的这种反差，在以前恰恰被认为是维系他们的纽带。如今把这些拿来充当理由，就有点勉强了，如同用去年的旧皮革做新鞋。

然而到了五月，弗朗茨终于找到机会打入了第一块楔子。一天中午，迪克脸色苍白、一身疲惫地走进他的办公室，一屁股坐下来，说：“完了，她走了。”

“她死了？”

“心脏不跳了。”

迪克累得像一摊泥一样坐在靠近房门的椅子上。一连三个不眠之夜，他守候在那个他已经喜欢上了的、满身疮疤的无名女艺术家身边，按时给她注射维持生命的肾上腺素，其实无异于给她那即将步入永恒黑暗的生命投下一丝微弱的光线。

弗朗茨能体会到他的心情，急忙安慰他说：“她患的是神经性梅毒。咱们做过的沃瑟曼[2]实验结果都是如此。她的脊髓……”

“此事就不提了，”迪克说，“唉，真是的！此事就不提了！如果她觉得这是秘密，愿意带到坟墓中去，那就由她去吧。”

“你最好休息一天。”

“不用为我担心，我会去休息的。”

弗朗茨打入了他的“楔子”——他正在给逝者的弟弟起草电文；接着他抬起头来问道：“你是不是想去做一次短途旅行？”

“现在不想。”

“我不是指休假。洛桑有个病人，今天一上午我都在跟一个智利人打电话说这件事呢……”

“她真够坚强的，”迪克自顾自地说着，“撑了那么长时间。”弗朗茨同情地摇了摇头。迪克回过神来，说道：“很抱歉，我打断了你的话。”

“我只是想让你换换环境……我要说的是一个父亲为儿子治病的事情——那位父亲由于无法把儿子送到这里来，于是就想请一位医生到洛桑去。”

“什么病？酒精中毒？还是同性恋？你是说在洛桑……”

“都有一点儿。”

“我可以去。有酬金吗？”

“应该说酬金相当丰厚。估计要在那儿待上两到三天。如果需要观察的话，就把那小伙子带到这儿来好啦。总之，别太匆忙，悠着点，一边观光散心一边做事。”

迪克上了火车，在火车上睡了两个小时，顿觉神清气爽。这样，他就可以以良好的精神状态同帕尔多——库伊达特·雷亚尔先生见面了。

医患见面的情形大同小异。一般来说，患者家属会表现得极为亢奋，简直跟病人的情况一样，这是一种很有意思的心理学现象。这次也不例外。帕尔多——库伊达特·雷亚尔先生是一位相貌堂堂、有着铁灰色头发的西班牙人。他举止高贵，穿着打扮充分显示出他的富有和权势。他在他下榻的三世界旅馆的套房里接待迪克时，一说起儿子就气不打一处来，来回踱着步，完全失去了自控，就像一个喝醉了酒的妇人。

“我现在一点办法都没有了，儿子不争气，堕落了。他在哈罗公学[3]时就不学好，在剑桥上皇家学院时也是一个样，已经到了无可救药的地步。现在他又酗酒成瘾，越来越不像话了，闹出的丑闻一个接一个。我把什么办法都试过了，却无济于事。我有个朋友是医生，我和他制订了一个方案，让他俩去西班牙旅行，边旅游边治疗。弗朗西斯科每天晚上都注射斑蝥药剂，随后他俩就一起去逛高等妓院。头一个星期似乎有些效果，后来却发现一点都不顶用。末了，也就是上个星期，就是在这个房间里，确切地说是在那间浴室里……”他用手指了指，“我让弗朗西斯科脱了上衣，用鞭子抽了他一顿……”

他情绪过于激动，把自己弄得精疲力竭，于是便坐了下来。

迪克说道：“让他们去西班牙做那样的旅行是很愚蠢的，不会起作用的……”他强忍着才没让自己笑出声来——他万万想不到一个有名望的医生竟会参加这种外行的实验！“先生，我必须实言相告：对于这种病，我们不能保证一治就能治得好。至于酗酒的问题，只要患者配合，我们一般还是有办法可行的。关键是要先见见孩子，让他增强自信心，使他对自己的病情有深入的认识。”

患者弗朗西斯科年方二十，英俊，机灵。

迪克把他带到露台上坐下，然后说道：“我想了解你的态度。你是不是觉得自己的状况越来越糟？愿意不愿意采取措施加以挽救？”

“我想我是愿意采取措施的，”弗朗西斯科说，“因为我现在的生活很不幸福。”

“依你看，这是不是由于酗酒或行为不正常而导致的？”

“我觉得是行为不正常导致了酗酒。”弗朗西斯科说话时表情严肃，但猛然之间忍俊不禁，哈哈大笑起来，说道，“简直没办法。在皇家学院上学时，同学们都称我‘智利女王’。至于到西班牙逛妓院，效果适得其反，弄得我一见到女人就恶心。”

迪克声色俱厉地喝止道：“你要是愿意自暴自弃，我就爱莫能助了。我这是在浪费时间。”

“别生气，咱们还是谈谈吧——跟别的人说话，我是不乐意的。”小伙子身上有一股阳刚之气，然而却走了样，变成了对父亲的反抗。而此时，他的眼里露出一种玩世不恭的神情（但凡同性恋者，一接触这个话题，一般都有这样的眼神）。

“再怎么说这也是一种见不得人的事，”迪克对他说道，“这会耗费掉你的生命，而且后患无穷。你将没有时间和精力从事任何体面的社会活动。要是你想直面这个世界，就必须从克制情欲入手——当务之急就是戒除酗酒的恶习，因为它会刺激情欲……”

他侃侃而谈——十分钟之前他还打算撒手不管，不再理会这个病案，此时却娓娓道来。二人谈得很投机，在接下来的一个小时里谈到了弗朗西斯科在智利的家，谈到了他的志向。以前，迪克只是从心理学的角度分析一个人的性格，而现在则以一种新的角度近观人性——他推断，正是性格中的某种力量使得弗朗西斯科有了离经叛道的行为。他认为这种力量独立存在于某些人身上——无论是今天上午死于诊所的那个不幸的女人表现出的近乎疯狂的勇气，抑或是这个迷途的小青年在讲述一段陈旧故事时所显现出的勇敢精神及典雅的风度，都说明了这一点。他试图将这种特征分割成若干小块贮藏在记忆里——他觉得人生就本质而言，整体与局部相比有着不同的意义；况且，一个人步入四十岁时，其人生只能以“局部”的观点加以审视。他对尼科尔和罗斯玛丽的爱，他在战争结束时与阿贝·诺思、汤米·巴尔班在那个破碎的世界上结下的友谊——在这样的关系中，各种个性似乎紧紧地向他挤压过来，要跟他融为一体。面对纷繁复杂的个性，他要么全盘接受，要么便全盘拒绝。似乎在他有生之年，他注定要沾染上某些人的个性，其中有他早年的相识，也有他早年爱过的人（那些人是什么样子，他也会有什么样的特征）。在他与人交往的过程中，还涉及孤独的成分——被别人爱很容易，爱别人则很难。

他和年轻的弗朗西斯科坐在露台上说话时，一个似曾相识的身影飘然进入了他的视野。来者是个身材高大的男子，步态有点古怪，摇摇晃晃的，他从灌木丛那儿钻出来，朝着迪克和弗朗西斯科这边走来，样子似乎有些迟疑。一时间，在生机盎然的景色中，他是那么不起眼，迪克几乎都没有注意到他。待他走到跟前，迪克才看清他，急忙站起身跟他握手，脸上显出若有所思的表情，心里翻江倒海般想个不停，竭力要回忆起来者的名字。

“是戴弗医生，对吧？”

“哦，哦……你是邓弗里先生吧？”

“罗亚尔·邓弗里。在下曾有幸在尊府漂亮的花园里跟阁下共进过晚宴。”

“是呀。”迪克很想给邓弗里先生的热情泼点冷水，便用一种干巴巴的语气说道，“那是在一九……一九二四年……或者一九二五年吧……”

他仍然站着，没给对方让座。罗亚尔·邓弗里起初还有些忸怩，但他毕竟是个老江湖，善于逢场作戏，于是便用随便、亲昵的语气跟弗朗西斯科套近乎，后者却不屑于跟他说话，和迪克一样巴不得叫他知趣地离去。

“戴弗医生，在你离开之前，我想对你说，在尊府花园里度过的那个傍晚，我今生今世都不会忘记的……你和你的夫人真是太热情了。那是我一生中最美好、最幸福的回忆。我始终认为，那是我所知道的品位最高的一次聚会。”

迪克继续像螃蟹一样侧着身子朝离自己最近的一扇门退去，口里说着：“很高兴那段往事给你留下了愉快的记忆。失陪了，我现在必须去见……”

“我理解你的心情，”罗亚尔·邓弗里同情地说，“听说他快死了。”

“谁快死了？”

“也许我不该说……我们请的是同一个医生。”

迪克收住脚步，惊讶地看着他，问：“你说的是谁呀？”

“嗬，当然是你的岳父呀……也许我……”

“我的什么？”

“我想……你的意思是我是第一个……”

“你是说，我的岳父在这儿，在洛桑？”

“怎么，我以为你知道呢……我以为你就是为这件事来这儿的。”

“哪位医生在照料他？”

迪克在记事本上草草写下了医生的名字，说了声“失陪”，就急匆匆去电话亭打电话了。

丹格医生说自己有空，愿意在他家马上跟戴弗医生见面。

丹格医生是个年轻的日内瓦人，起初有些担心会失去这么一个有利可图的病人。不过，迪克解释了来由后，他便放心了，接着便如实地介绍了病情，说沃伦先生的确快要死了。

“他才五十岁，但他的肝脏已经坏死，病情恶化的原因是酒精中毒。”

“还能治吗？”

“他已不能进食除了流食以外的东西……我想他只能活三天，最多也只能撑一个星期。”

“他的长女沃伦小姐知道他的病况吗？”

“根据他自己的意愿，除了他的男仆，没让任何人知道。直到今天上午，我觉得有必要告诉他实情……虽然一开始治病他就十分坦然，抱着听天由命的态度，可是听了实情后他还是感到非常不安。”

迪克想了想说：“这样吧……”他斟酌再三后做出了决定。“不管怎样，我来通知他的亲属。不过，我想他们肯定会要求进行一次会诊。”

“悉听尊便。”

“为病人的家属考虑，我想请你出面把赫伯鲁格医生请来会诊，他可是日内瓦湖滨地区最有名气的医生。”

“我也在考虑请他来呢。”

“我在这儿至少还要待一天，我会跟你沟通的。”

当天晚上，迪克去见帕尔多——库伊达特·雷亚尔先生，二人又进行了一番长谈。

“我们在智利有大宗产业……”老人说，“我儿子可以去那儿管理这些产业。在巴黎，我们有十几家企业，也可以安排他经营企业……”他忧愁地摇着头，在窗前踱步，而窗外春雨喜人，天鹅没有找地方避雨，“他可是我唯一的儿子！你不能带他一起走吗？”

这个西班牙人突然跪倒在迪克的脚下。

“难道你就不能治好我儿子的病吗？我相信你……你可以带他一起走，一定能治好他的病。”

“这种问题，不是一个人能解决的。我即便想带他走，也是不能这么做的。”

西班牙人站起身说：“恕我鲁莽……我这也是急得……”

迪克要下楼到门厅去，在电梯间碰上了丹格医生。

“我正要去你的房间呢，”后者说，“能到外面的露台上说话吗？”

“沃伦先生死了吗？”迪克问道。

“他还是那样……会诊安排在明天上午。另外，他要见他的女儿——也就是你的妻子……他的心情非常急迫。看起来他们父女好像吵过架……”

“情况我都知道了。”

两位医生面面相觑，各有各的心思。

“你何不先跟他谈谈，然后再做决定？”丹格医生建议说，“让他走得安详一些……他现在只是虚弱，精神不振，还能说得了话。”

迪克勉强同意了。

“好吧。”

德弗鲁·沃伦的房间和帕尔多——库伊达特·雷亚尔先生住的那一套一般大小。此时，他正在这儿体面地等待死亡，身体越来越弱，精神越来越恍惚。这家旅馆里的客人可谓三教九流，有破落户、亡命之徒，也有某些小国家丧失了王位的天涯沦落人——这些人终日吸食鸦片或服用镇静剂，总是守着收音机听同样的节目，不是听靡靡之音就是听下流歌曲。欧洲的这个小小的角落之所以诱人，在于它来者不拒，不问令人尴尬的问题。这儿是许多道路的交会处，在这里可以看见前往私人疗养院的人，也可以看见去山区肺结核疗养中心的人，其中有落魄的法国人，也有失势的意大利人。

房间里光线暗淡。一个慈眉善目的修女在护理沃伦，而沃伦在用瘦得和鸡爪一样的手拨弄白色床单上的一串念珠。他仍是那么英俊，在丹格离开后，便同迪克交谈起来，说话时带着很有个性的重重的卷舌音。

“一个人到了生命的尽头，就会对人生大彻大悟。也只有现在，戴弗医生，我才悟透了人生的前因后果。”

迪克等他说下去。

“我是个有污点的坏人。你肯定认为我不配再见到尼科尔，但那位高高在上的圣人要求人们以慈悲为怀，学会宽恕和怜悯。”那串念珠从他无力的手中掉落在光滑的床单上，再从床单滑落到地上。迪克帮他把念珠捡起来。“要是我能见上尼科尔十分钟，我就会快快活活地离开人世。”

“这不能由我一个人说了算，”迪克说，“尼科尔很虚弱。”他内心已做了决定，但表面却装出自己不能做主的样子。“我可以把你的请求转告给尼科尔的医生。”

“你的那个同事一定会同意的……戴弗医生。请允许我告诉你，我欠下你一笔还也还不完的债……”

迪克没等他说完就站了起来，说道：“我会让丹格医生把结果告诉你的。”

回到自己的房间，他给楚格湖的诊所挂了电话。过了很久，凯绥才在她自己家接了电话。

“我有事要跟弗朗茨商量。”

“弗朗茨到山上去了。我也正要去……有什么事需要我转告他吗，迪克？”

“是关于尼科尔的事……她父亲在洛桑，已不久于人世了。你告诉弗朗茨事关重大，让他从山上给我打个电话。”

“好的。”

“告诉他，从三点到五点，还有从七点到八点，我都在旅馆的房间里。八点过后，就叫服务员到餐厅里找我。”

在交代打电话的时间时，他却忘了说此事不能让尼科尔知道，等到想起来时，对方已经把电话挂了。不过，他心想凯绥应该是知道这一点的。

话说凯绥乘火车上山时，的确没有打算将迪克打电话来的事情告诉尼科尔。但见空寂的山坡上开着野花，风儿送来阵阵幽香。诊所的病人冬天会被带到这儿滑雪，春天则让他们爬山。下车时，她一眼瞧见尼科尔正领着孩子们嬉戏玩耍，于是走上前，伸出一只胳膊温柔地搂住尼科尔的肩膀说：“你带孩子真有一套……到了夏天，应该教他们学学游泳。”

由于和孩子们玩耍玩热了，尼科尔不由把身子朝后一缩，本是无意，却显得无礼。凯绥的胳膊尴尬地落了空，使得她恼羞成怒。

于是凯绥言辞激烈地说：“你以为我要拥抱你吗？还不是要跟你说说迪克。我们通了电话，说起来让我感到难过……”

“迪克出事了吗？”

凯绥猛然意识到自己说漏了嘴，干了件没名堂的蠢事，现在已没有了退路。面对尼科尔反复的追问：“你为什么要感到难过呢？”她只好胡乱支吾道：“迪克没出事。有件事我必须告诉弗朗茨。”

“肯定是迪克出事了！”

尼科尔惊得花容失色，吓得她身边的一双儿女也神情大变。凯绥顿时像泄了气的皮球一样蔫了下来，说道：“你父亲病了，现在在洛桑……迪克要跟弗朗茨谈这件事。”

“他病得很重吗？”尼科尔问。就在这时，只见弗朗茨走了过来，一副十足的医生派头。凯绥暗自庆幸，觉得这件事可以交给他处理了。遗憾的是，她说出的话想收也收不回来了。

“我要去洛桑。”尼科尔郑重说道。

“等一下，”弗朗茨说，“我认为不必太匆忙。让我先和迪克通个电话再决定。”

“那会错过下山的火车的，”尼科尔反驳道，“错过下山的车，也就赶不上三点钟从苏黎世发的那趟车了！如果我父亲病危，我就必须……”她欲言又止，未敢把后半句话说出来。“反正我必须走，必须赶上这趟车。”她没等话落音转身就跑了，朝着火车奔去——那火车如一条长龙停在了光秃秃的山顶上，喷着气，鸣叫着。她边跑边回过头来喊道：“要是你打电话给迪克，就说我去找他了，弗朗茨！”

迪克坐在旅馆他的房间里看《纽约先驱报》，却见那位燕子般轻盈的修女闯了进来。与此同时，电话铃响了。

“他死了吗？”迪克抱着一线希望问修女。

“先生，他不见了——他走掉了。”

“你说什么？”

“他不见了，连人带行李都不见了。”

简直匪夷所思！一个行将就木的人怎么能爬起来走掉了！

迪克接了弗朗茨打来的电话，知道了情况后就埋怨道：“你不该让尼科尔知道。”

“是凯绥告诉她的，很不明智。”

“恐怕错在我身上——在事情没有眉目之前，就不该对女人讲。不提了，我去接尼科尔吧……告诉你，弗朗茨，这儿发生了一件最为蹊跷的事情——那老头竟然从病床上爬起来走掉了！”

“什么？你说什么？”

“我说他走了。沃伦老头走了！”

“这有什么奇怪的呢？”

“他卧床不起，已经是快死的人了，谁知却爬起来走掉了，大概是回芝加哥去了……具体情况不清楚，护士现在就在这儿……我不知道，弗朗茨，我也是刚听说……稍后你再打电话来吧。”

接下来，迪克用了差不多两个小时的时间打听沃伦的去向。原来，那个病人趁白班和夜班护士换班的机会，溜进了酒吧，连喝了四杯威士忌，然后用一张一千美元的钞票支付旅馆的费用，吩咐服务员把要找的零钱寄给他。随即他便扬长而去，可能是要回美国去。迪克和丹格冲到火车站去追他，想把他拦回来，非但扑了空，也没能接到尼科尔。迪克回到旅馆，在门厅里见到了尼科尔。尼科尔满脸倦容，把嘴噘得高高的，让他感到十分不安。

“爸爸怎么样了？”她问。

“他好多了。看来他身上蕴藏着充足的精力。”他迟疑了一下，随后讲出了实情，“实际上，他起了床，走掉了。”

迪克刚才忙着找人，没顾上吃饭，此时想喝杯酒解乏，便把迷茫的尼科尔带到了餐厅里。二人在皮椅子上落座，要了一杯掺水的威士忌和一杯啤酒。接着，迪克继续说道：“他的医生可能诊断有误吧……或者说……我还没来得及细想呢，不便下结论。”

“他真的走了？”

“是的，坐上去巴黎的晚班车走了。”

他们默默地坐着。尼科尔显得淡漠和悲伤。

“他的离去完全是本能的反应。”迪克最后说道，“他明明知道自己就要死了，却不甘心，还想按以前的节奏生活——像这般临死前突然不辞而别，他可不是第一个人。这就跟一个旧钟表一样，你晃一晃它，它就会重新走起来，纯粹是一种惯性。你父亲……”

“请你别说了。”尼科尔说。

“恐惧是他的动力。”迪克仍在说着，“他害怕死亡，于是就躲掉了。他也许能活到九十岁呢……”

“请别再说了！”尼科尔央求道，“你再说，我就受不了了。”

“好吧。我这次来给那个小鬼头诊疗，发现那家伙已无可救药了。咱们明天可以回家去了。”

“我不明白你为什么非得掺和这样的事！”尼科尔突然发起了火。

“哦，你不明白吗？有时我也不明白。”

她抓住了他的手，歉疚地说：“对不起，我真不该这么说你，迪克。”

这时，有个人带着留声机来到了餐厅里。于是，大家就坐在那儿一起听《彩绘娃娃的婚礼》。





第三章


一周后的一个上午，迪克到前台取信件，听见门外乱糟糟地起了响动，原来是有个叫冯·科恩·莫里斯的病人要离开诊所。他的父母是澳大利亚人，正在把他的行李扑通扑通地往一辆大轿车里塞，而拉迪斯劳医生站在旁边，对老莫里斯粗暴的行为表示抗议，但又无力阻挠。迪克走过去时，发现那个年轻病人只是冷眼旁观，一副讥讽的表情。

“这是不是有点过于匆忙啦，莫里斯先生？”

莫里斯先生一见是迪克，显得有些吃惊——他那红润的脸以及外套上的大格子图案像霓虹灯一闪一闪的。随后，他气势汹汹地冲着迪克走了过来，那架势就好像要打迪克一样。

“我们早该走了，非但我们该走，和我们一起来的都早该走了。”他开口便这样说道，然后停下来换了口气，“早该走了，戴弗医生，早该走了！”

“你能到我的办公室来一下吗？”迪克建议道。

“我不去！我会跟你谈的，但要谈的是跟你以及你的诊所一刀两断。”

“我很抱歉！”

莫里斯先生边说边朝迪克晃着指头。“我刚才还在跟这位医生说呢，我们待在这儿简直是浪费时间，浪费钱。”

拉迪斯劳医生一听，又说了几句表示抗议的话，但意思含糊不清，就像斯拉夫人那样，话语模棱两可（迪克一直都不喜欢拉迪斯劳）。迪克试图把这位情绪激动的澳大利亚人沿着小径引到他的办公室里去，于是便苦口婆心地劝说了一通，谁知那老头摇着头，硬是不肯去。

“要怪都怪你，戴弗医生，问题都出在你身上！我找拉迪斯劳医生，是因为找不到你，戴弗医生。还因为要到晚上才能见到格雷戈罗维斯医生，而我不想等。不想等，先生！我儿子告诉了我真相后，我一分钟也不想等了。”

他咄咄逼人地走近迪克，而迪克摆好架势，随时准备出拳还击。“我儿子是因为酗酒才来这儿治疗的，他却说你满嘴的酒气。真有你的，先生！”他说着还抽了抽鼻子，想从迪克身上闻到酒味，一时却没有闻到，“冯·科恩说他闻到你嘴里有酒气，已不止一两次了。我和我的妻子可是一辈子都没有沾过酒！我们把冯·科恩托付给你，让你给他治病，而他在一个月之内，竟然两次闻到你满嘴酒气！这到底是哪门子治疗法？”

迪克沉吟着，生怕莫里斯先生在诊所的车道上大闹起来。

“恕我直言，莫里斯先生，不能因为你儿子的缘故，就要求别人放弃被视为食物的……”

“但你是个医生，伙计！”莫里斯愤怒地嚷嚷道，“若是做工的，喝点啤酒倒是情有可原，可你是给人治病的……”

“这就扯得太远了。你儿子到这儿来是因为他有小偷小摸的习惯。”

“背后的原因是什么？”莫里斯吼道，声音像是在尖叫，“是酗酒，是喝罪恶的酒！你知道酒是什么颜色吗？是罪恶的黑色！我的亲叔叔就是因为酗酒而犯罪，最终被绞死的。你听清了吗？我儿子来这儿戒酒，谁知医生却是个酒鬼！”

“请你走吧！”

“你请我走？是我们自己要走的！”

“假如你别发这么大的脾气，我们可以跟你讲一讲截至目前的治疗效果。当然了，既然你这么想我们，我们也就不愿收治你的儿子了……”

“你还有脸说我‘发脾气’？”

迪克招呼拉迪斯劳医生过来，待他走近时，对他说道：“你能否代表我们送一送这位病人和他的家属？”

随后，他对莫里斯欠了欠身，便去办公室了。进了办公室，他在门跟前呆呆地站了一会儿，目送着那对粗俗的父母以及他们那精神麻木、行为堕落的后代驾车离去。不难设想，这家人肯定会一脸无知地在欧洲四处寻医，仗着手里有几个臭钱，便在有修养的人面前张牙舞爪。但是，轿车消失之后，迪克不禁进行了一番反思，想看一看这场风波的出现有几分是他引起的。他每餐必喝红酒，晚上一般来一杯热朗姆酒，有时下午还饮几口杜松子酒（喝杜松子酒，嘴里是很难闻到气味的）。平均下来，他每天喝半品脱酒，而这对他的身体而言有点太多了。

他原来还想为自己寻找开脱的理由，后来打消了这个念头，在办公桌前坐下，就像开处方一样列了一份方案，决定把酒量减掉一半。画家、股票经纪人和骑兵军官什么的多喝一点酒没关系，而医生、司机和新教牧师的身上是不应该闻到酒味的。迪克有点自责，但这种自责只是怪自己不够谨慎。可是，半小时之后，回诊所时，此事仍余波未息。话说弗朗茨在阿尔卑斯山休了两个星期的假，显得精神抖擞，渴望着赶快工作，还没走进办公室，就有点急不可耐了。就在这时，迪克找了过来。

“攀登珠穆朗玛峰[4]的感觉怎么样呀？”

“按我们的速度，攀登珠穆朗玛峰不在话下。我们也曾经想过要到那儿去呢。这里的情况怎么样？我的凯绥好吗？你的尼科尔近况如何？”

“家里的一切都顺顺当当的。不过，唉，弗朗茨，今天上午出了一件糟糕透顶的事。”

“怎么啦？出什么事了？”

弗朗茨嘴里说着，却走过去给他家打起了电话。迪克就在房间里踱步等待。等到他和家里通过话，迪克说道：“那个叫莫里斯的小伙子被家人接走了……他们还大闹了一场。”

弗朗茨一听，脸色顿时由晴转阴了。

“他被接走，我已经知道了——我在走廊碰见了拉迪斯劳。”

“拉迪斯劳说了些什么？”

“只说小莫里斯走了，还说你会告诉我一切的。到底是怎么回事？”

“还不就是没事找事、胡搅蛮缠呗。”

“那孩子是个魔鬼，很难对付。”

“他的酒瘾的确很难戒除。”迪克顺着弗朗茨的话茬说道，“我走过去的时候，那个做父亲的已经把拉迪斯劳收拾得服服帖帖，乖顺得就像殖民地的人。你觉得拉迪斯劳怎么样？咱们还留他吗？依我说就别留了——他没有多大的出息，什么事都应付不了。”说到这里，他犹豫了起来，不知该不该道出实情，于是便走开一些来理清思路。后来见弗朗茨坐在桌沿上，仍穿着亚麻布旅行风衣，戴着旅行手套，迪克索性来了个竹筒倒豆子，全都说了出来。“那孩子对他父亲的申诉，其中一条就是：你的杰出的合伙人是个酒鬼。那老头认死理，硬说他儿子在我身上闻到了酒味。”

弗朗茨在桌旁坐了下来，若有所思地咬了咬下嘴唇，最后说道：“以后你可以细细跟我讲讲。”

“何不现在就讲呢？”迪克说，“你肯定知道，我是最讨厌无度饮酒的。”他望着弗朗茨的眼睛，四目对视了一会儿，“当时，拉迪斯劳委曲求全，弄得那老头气焰嚣张，使我难以招架。在那么多病人面前，弄不好事态会扩大的。你可以想象得到，在那种情况下自我申辩该有多难！”

弗朗茨摘掉手套，脱了外衣，走到门口对秘书说：“别打搅我们。”回到房间，他在一张长条桌旁坐下，随便翻着桌上的信件。（这种姿势，与其说是要敞开心扉交谈，倒不如说要为某种必须要说的话寻找合适的借口。）

“迪克，尽管你我在饮酒问题上看法并不完全一致，但我很清楚你是个有节制、稳重的人。不过，得开诚布公地说说了……迪克，我必须坦率地说，我有好几次注意到你在不该喝酒的时候却开怀痛饮。这里面当然也是有原因的。你何不再出去一段时间戒戒酒呢？”

“是支我走呗！”迪克想也没想便更正道，“光让我走，是解决不了问题的。”

他们俩都有些恼火。弗朗茨回来时兴冲冲的，而此时兴头大减。

“有的时候，你可真是不理智，迪克。”

“我只知道如果一个普通医生在医术上超过专家时应该理智对待，真不知道还有其他什么疑难问题需要理智对待。”

突然之间，迪克对眼前的状况感到不胜其烦。难道要让他诉说苦衷，弥合分歧？他已这把岁数，自然做不来。那么，聆听对方的教诲，听任事态的发展？

“长痛不如短痛！”他突然说道。

“好吧，我也是这么想的。”弗朗茨承认道，“反正你的心已不在这里了，迪克。”

“我懂了。我也想离开了。咱们可以做出安排，逐步把尼科尔的钱提取出来。”

“这一点我也做过考虑，迪克——我料到会有这么一天的。我可以找别的资助，今年年底就能够把你们的钱悉数交还给你们。”

迪克原来并无意这么快就散伙，也没料到弗朗茨竟然如此痛快地愿意散伙。不过，他心里仍有一种如释重负的感觉。他老早就不无痛心地感到：他的职业生涯在渐渐沦丧，在慢慢失去生命力。





第四章


戴弗一家打算回里维埃拉，那儿是他们的家。但黛安娜别墅在夏季租出去了，所以，他们在这段时间乐得云游天下，在德国的矿泉疗养地住几天，再到法国那些有着大教堂的城镇过几天闲云野鹤般的日子。大家都高高兴兴的。迪克在写作上没有什么安排，但也写了一些东西。对他而言，生活成了一种期待，并不是期待尼科尔的身体有什么变化（尼科尔在这段时间，身体似乎好得不得了），也不是期待工作，反正只是一种期待。真正使这段日子显得有意义的因素是孩子们。

他们的孩子大的十一岁，小的九岁。随着他们年龄的增长，迪克对他们的关注度越来越高。他跟孩子们沟通，与保姆和家庭女教师所采取的方式不同。他是有原则的，认为苛责和放任都是下策，上策是对他们进行长期的、细心的观察，正确地考察、评估和判断他们的言行，这样才不至于在履行监管职责时有所疏漏。他比尼科尔更了解他们——几杯各国的名酒落肚之后，他会兴致勃勃地同孩子们海阔天空地聊天，尽情地玩乐。两个孩子都很深沉，甚至可以说有点忧伤（这种孩子自小就很内敛，既不会任性地哭闹，也不会畅怀大笑）；他们似乎绝不会流露出大喜大悲的偏激情绪，而是在允许的范围内过着简单的生活，享受着简单的欢乐。根据西方世界那些古老家族教养儿女的经验（即约束，而非放纵的经验），这种四平八稳的生活方式是可取的。迪克倡导的就是这么一种方式，他认为克制和沉默最有利于观察和认识世界。

拉尼尔是个叫人难以捉摸的孩子，好奇心之浓厚异于常人，经常向迪克提“要多少只波美尼亚狗[5]才能打败一头狮子，爸爸？”这一类问题，让迪克回答不出来。托普西则比较容易对付。她年仅九岁，长得很漂亮，很标致，跟尼科尔一个模样。以前，迪克老担心她身子骨弱，近来发现她跟别的美国孩子一样结实、健康。对这两个孩子，他都很满意，但在表达这种心情时却很含蓄。孩子们有过必罚，按迪克的话说：“在家不学会做人，到了社会上别人也会用皮鞭教你学会的，那时让你吃不了兜着走。”他还说：“我才不管托普西是不是喜欢我呢！我把她养大，又不是让她做我的妻子。”

这年夏天和秋天之所以有别于往年，对戴弗夫妇来说，那就是他们有了大把大把的钱。由于卖掉了诊所的股份，再加上在美国的投资收益，他们现在富得流油，如何花钱以及怎样看管买来的东西倒成了一个问题。他们四处旅游，出手阔绰，很讲究排场。

就拿他们到博延旅游时的情况做个例子吧。当时，他们打算在博延花两个星期的时间游览观光。火车一进站，他们就忙乱了起来（其实，他们在意大利边境就开始在包厢里收拾行李了）。家庭女教师的女仆和戴弗夫人的女仆从二等车厢跑来帮助照料行李和几条狗。贝卢瓦小姐负责拿手提包，一位女仆负责照看几条锡利哈姆狗[6]，另一位女仆则负责看管一对狮子狗。一个女人喜欢身边有热闹的生活，未必是精神空虚的表现，倒可能说是兴趣十分广泛。除了发病的日子，尼科尔完全够格做个总管。就拿那一大堆行李来说吧——现在得从行李车厢卸下四只衣箱、一只鞋箱、三只帽箱（另外还有两个帽盒）、一排放仆人物品的箱子、一只轻便文件柜、一只医药箱、一只酒精灯箱、一套野餐用具、装在盒内的四副网球拍、一架留声机和一架打字机。除此之外，还有二十多只手提包、背包和购物袋是备用的，留着给家里人以及随行人员使用。这些行李，每一件都有编号，箱笼上都挂着标签。到站下车时，所有的行李两分钟内就可以清点完毕，标有“重行李”字样的送去存起来，标有“轻行李”字样的则随身带走（这些标签随时更改——金属边的小牌就放在尼科尔的手袋里）。这套办法是尼科尔小时候随体弱多病的母亲出外旅行时想出来的。如果军队里的某个军需官用这种办法，为三千将士提供给养和辎重就不用发愁了。

戴弗一家浩浩荡荡地下了火车，走进了早早就暮色笼罩的山谷里。村民们以敬畏的目光注视着这些客人，场面就跟一百年前拜伦爵士光临意大利时一样。接待他们的女主人是明盖蒂伯爵夫人（前不久她的芳名叫玛丽·诺思）。玛丽·诺思的人生旅途发端于纽瓦克一家裱糊店楼上的一个房间里，后来以一桩不寻常的婚姻告一段落。

所谓的“明盖蒂伯爵”只是教皇恩赐的一个空头衔——玛丽的丈夫在亚洲的西南部拥有几座锰矿，于是一夜暴富，钻营来了这么一个头衔。他肤色较黑，在梅森——狄克森分界线[7]以南是不允许乘坐卧铺车厢旅行的。他有着从北非到亚洲一带的卡比尔人、柏柏尔人、赛伯伊人和印度人的血统，但比起港口的那些混血儿搬运工，对欧洲人而言更亲和一些。

当这两个王侯般的家庭（一个是东方式的，一个是西方式的）相会于火车站的站台上时，戴弗一家就黯然失色了，相形之下就像是一群行装朴素的拓荒者。男女主人随身带来了一个意大利人总管，而总管率领着一支欢迎的队伍，其中包括四个骑摩托车而来的缠着头巾的家臣和两个半遮着面纱的女子。那两个女子恭顺地站在玛丽的身后，朝尼科尔行了个穆斯林式额手礼，差点把尼科尔吓得跳起来。

不仅对戴弗一家，甚至对玛丽来说，这种欢迎场面也不免有些好笑。玛丽咯咯直笑，像是在道歉，又像是在自嘲。不过，在介绍丈夫的亚洲头衔时，她的声音则流露出骄傲和自豪。

在客房里换装准备赴宴时，迪克和尼科尔相顾一笑，彼此做了个鬼脸——他们想不到竟有这样的富人，明明是暗中较劲炫富摆阔，还想让别人觉得他们倾向于大众化。

“小玛丽·诺思现在可是有主见的人了。”迪克满脸都是剃须膏，开口说道，“阿贝给了她启蒙教育，而现在她嫁给了一位天神。要是欧洲布尔什维克化，她说不定会成为斯大林的新娘呢。”

尼科尔从梳妆盒前抬起头，四下看了看说：“说话注意点，迪克，行吗？”但说完她却笑了起来，“他们真够气派的，听说军舰都向他们鸣炮致意呢。玛丽在伦敦坐的可是皇家汽车！”

“是这样的。”迪克随声附和道。当他听到尼科尔在门口叫人拿些饰针来时，他便喊了一声：“不知道我能否要些威士忌？我觉得山里真够凉的！”

“女仆会安排的。”片刻之后，尼科尔来到浴室门口对他说，“这个女仆就是到车站去的那两个女子中的一个，现在把面纱摘掉了。”

“玛丽跟你谈了些什么？”迪克问。

“没说什么。她对上流社会的生活很感兴趣，问了我许多有关我家家谱之类的问题，好像我是个内行似的。若说她的郎君，似乎与前妻生了两个深肤色的孩子，其中一个得了一种难以诊治的亚洲病。我得让咱家的孩子小心点。那种病听起来怪怪的。怕就怕玛丽多心。”尼科尔说到这里，显得有点发愁。

“她会理解的。”迪克安慰她，“再说，那个病孩子也许在床上躺着呢。”

吃晚饭的时候，迪克跟玛丽的老公侯赛因进行了交谈。侯赛因曾在一家英国公立学校读过书，很想了解有关证券和好莱坞的情况，而迪克借助香槟酒激发想象力，信口开河地乱讲了一通。

“拍个片子难道能花几十亿？”侯赛因不信地问。

“几万亿呢。”迪克语气坚定地说。

“我真是无法想象……”

“哦，也许是几百万吧。”迪克改口说道，“住进旅馆的客人，每个人都可以分到一个陪睡女……或者是应召女郎什么的。”

“不是演员和导演的人也能分到？”

“旅馆的每一位房客都有份——甚至包括旅行推销员。嗨，他们有一次给我送来十几个让我挑选，可是尼科尔哪能容忍得了。”

回到房间后，尼科尔责怪他道：“干吗要喝那么多酒？为什么要当着他的面用spic[8]这个词？”

“抱歉，我是想说抽烟[9]，结果舌头打了个滑。”

“迪克，这可一点不像你平时的风格。”

“很抱歉，我跟从前的我的确不太一样了。”

这天夜里，迪克推开浴室窗户，看到的是这座别墅的一处狭长的管状庭院，看起来呈鼠灰色，这时耳边听到一阵如泣如诉的独特的乐声，凄凉哀婉，像是用笛子吹出来的。有两个人在咏诵，操的是某种东方语言或某处的地方话，夹杂着许多K音和L音。他探出身去，但不见其人，只闻其声——那声音很明显包含着宗教意味。他十分疲倦，也无热情，觉得就让他们祷告吧，但愿他们为他祈祷。可是，除了祈祷他万不可迷失自我，心情一味地败坏下去，他不知道还应该祈祷些什么。

第二天，在一片树木稀疏的山坡上，他们打下了几只瘦小的鸟（这种鸟是山鹑的远亲）。狩猎时，他们大致模仿英国人的方法，雇了一群未经训练的人来赶鸟。迪克害怕打中他们，只好等到鸟儿飞到头顶上方才开枪。

回来后，他发现拉尼尔正在他们的房间里等他。

“爸爸，你说过，要是我们靠近了那个有病的男孩，就立即告诉你。”

尼科尔一听，猛地转过身来，顿时警觉起来。

“是这样的，妈妈，”拉尼尔转向她继续说了起来，“那男孩每天晚上都洗澡，昨天晚上他正好在我前头洗澡，我只好在他用过的水里洗，但我觉得那水很脏。”

“什么？怎么回事？”

“我看见他们把托尼抱出了浴缸，随后就叫我进去洗，水很脏。”

“可是……你洗了吗？”

“洗了，妈妈。”

“天哪！”尼科尔冲着迪克大叫了一声。

迪克问：“吕西安娜为什么没有为你换水？”

“吕西安娜不敢换。那台热水器很奇怪，会自动喷出热水来，前天晚上把她的胳膊都烫伤了，弄得她都害怕了。所以，另外的那个女仆就……”

“你马上进这间浴室，现在就洗个澡。”

“别说是我告诉你的。”拉尼尔在浴室门口说。

迪克走进去，在浴缸里洒了些硫黄粉，然后出来随手拉上门，对尼科尔说：“咱们要么跟玛丽去说，要么最好搬出去住。”

她同意了。他接着说：“人们总以为自己的孩子比别人家的干净，即便有病也不会有多大的传染性。”

他说完，走过去从玻璃水瓶里给自己倒了些水，听着浴室里哗哗的水声，咯吱咯吱用劲嚼起了饼干。

“跟吕西安娜讲，她得学会用热水器……”他没有把话讲完，就见那位亚裔女子出现在了门口。

“伯爵大人……”

迪克招呼她进来，然后关上了门。

“那个有病的小男孩好些了吗？”他和颜悦色地问道。

“好些了，不过还是常发病。”

“真是太糟了。我为此感到十分难过。不过，你应该明白，他洗过澡的水不能让我们的孩子再用。那是绝对不行的！我敢说，你的女主人知道你做了这事，一定会生气的。”

“我？”她惊愕万状，如遭雷击，“什么？我只是见你们的女佣不会用热水器，于是就教了教她，并且放了水。”

“病人用过的洗澡水必须全部放掉，把浴缸擦干净。”

“我？”

那女子一时说不出话来，深深吸了口气，浑身一抽搐，哽咽了一声，扭头便冲了出去。

“不能让她为了追求西方文明而把我们当牺牲品。”迪克阴沉着脸说。

那天晚餐的时候，他断定这次做客不会拖得太久。谈起他自己的国家，侯赛因似乎只知道那儿有许多大山，有羊群和羊倌。他是个矜持寡言的年轻人，让他说话得费很大的劲儿。迪克索性把这份精力省下来，觉得还是把它用在自己家里人身上好。餐后不久，侯赛因告辞走了，只留下玛丽陪伴戴弗夫妇了。他一走，那种和谐的气氛便随之消失了。玛丽如坐针毡，口不应心地说着客套话。九点钟的时候，有人送来一张纸条，她读完后站了起来，迪克见了如释重负。

“请原谅，失陪了。我丈夫要做一次短途旅行，我得跟着去。”

次日早晨，仆人刚把咖啡送进来，玛丽就进了他们的房间，她衣着整齐，而他们还没有穿衣。看样子，她起床已经有些时候了，紧绷着脸，怒气冲冲的。

“拉尼尔用脏水洗澡，此事从何谈起？”

迪克刚要辩解，却被她打断了，说道：“你们命令我丈夫的姐姐为拉尼尔清洗浴缸，此事从何谈起？”

她站在那儿，气鼓鼓地瞪着他们，而他俩木头人一般呆坐在床上，手里端着咖啡。末了，他俩不禁一道叫了起来：“那是他姐姐？！”

“想不到你们竟然命令他的姐姐清洗浴缸！”

“没有呀……”夫妻俩异口同声地说道，“只是交代了一下女仆呀。”

“那是侯赛因的姐姐！”

迪克只好说：“我以为她们是两个女仆呢。”

“我告诉过你们，说她们是喜马多[10]。”

“什么？”迪克从床上跳起来，披上了睡袍。

“前天晚上我跟你说这话时，你在弹钢琴。该不是太兴奋了，没听明白吧？”

“你说的是这个吗？头几句我没注意听，没有把前后连接起来，所以没有弄明白，玛丽。好吧，我们就去找她，向她赔礼道歉。”

“还赔礼道歉呢！我早对你说过：他是他们家的长子，一结婚，两个姐姐就献身成为喜马多，成为他妻子的侍女。”

“昨晚侯赛因离开这儿就是出于这个原因吗？”

玛丽犹豫了一下，随后点了点头。

“他不得不离开……他们都走了。为了荣誉，他必须这么做。”

此时，戴弗夫妇已起了床，正在穿衣服。

玛丽继续说道：“这一切都是洗澡水引起的。弄得就好像在这个家里真的会发生这种事似的！必须去找拉尼尔来问个明白。”

迪克坐在床沿上，对尼科尔偷偷做了个手势，让她处理这件事。于是，当玛丽走到门口，用意大利语吩咐一个仆人去叫拉尼尔时，尼科尔说道：“等一下，我不愿意那么做。”

“你们指责了我们，”玛丽说道，语气之强硬是她以前从未对尼科尔用过的，“现在我有权弄清楚。”

“我不愿让你把孩子叫来。”尼科尔把衣服往身上一披，仿佛那衣服是锁子甲战衣似的。

“那好吧，”迪克说，“就叫拉尼尔来吧。咱们索性把洗澡水的事情弄个水落石出，看看那是事实还是谎言。”

拉尼尔来时，衣服还没完全穿好，思想上也没准备，只是茫然地望着一脸怒容的大人们。

“听着，拉尼尔，”玛丽开始提问，“你怎么会想到你洗澡时用的是别人用过的洗澡水呢？”

“你说吧！”迪克补加了一句。

“水是脏的，就这么回事。”

“你洗澡时难道听不到隔壁有放新水的声音吗？”

拉尼尔承认也许听到了，但他坚持他的观点——水是脏的。他有点害怕，不知道会发生什么样的事情，于是改口说：“不可能放了新水，因为……”

几个大人追问道：“为什么不可能？”

拉尼尔裹着一件短小的和服式晨衣站在那儿，让他的父母觉得心疼，却叫玛丽感到不耐烦……末了，只听他说道：“水是脏的，里面尽是肥皂沫。”

“要是你不敢确定自己说的话……”玛丽刚开口，就被尼科尔打断了。

“别说了，玛丽。要是水里有脏的泡沫，那么他就自然会认为水是脏的了。他的父亲要他来……”

“水里不可能有脏的泡沫。”

拉尼尔不满地瞥了他父亲一眼，怨父亲出卖了他。尼科尔扳住他的肩膀让他转过身去，把他领了出去。迪克笑了一声，想打破室内紧张的气氛。

这笑声仿佛勾起了玛丽对昔日岁月的回忆，使她想起了过去的友谊，觉得自己有点过头，疏远了朋友，于是换上一副化干戈为玉帛的语气说道：“小孩子的事情都是这样，不必认真。”

她越是想到过去的友谊，心中越是不安，见迪克他们要走，便劝说道：“你们要走可就太傻了……不管怎样，侯赛因反正是要出门旅行的。你们毕竟是我的客人，再说你们也是一时疏忽而已。”迪克有点生气，觉得她偏心眼，反倒怪他们“疏忽”，于是便转身走开，开始收拾行李，嘴里说道：“实在对不起那两位姑娘。我真想对来这儿的那位当面道歉。”

“要是你坐在钢琴凳上的时候，注意听我说话就好了！”

“可你的话也太无聊了，我已经够耐心的了。”

“不必再说了！”尼科尔劝他。

“谢谢他的恭维，”玛丽恨恨地说，“再见，尼科尔。”说完，她拂袖而去。

事已至此，她也就不可能为他们送行了，送行之事就由管家代为安排了。迪克给侯赛因和他的两个姐姐留了正式的信函说明原因。除了离开，别无选择，但他们全家都为此感到难过，尤其是拉尼尔。

“我还是要说，”到了火车上，拉尼尔仍在坚持自己的说法，“洗澡水是脏的。”

“够了，”他父亲说，“你最好还是把这件事忘掉吧。如若不然，我就跟你脱离关系。你可知，法国最近有一条新法律，允许父亲跟儿子脱离关系？”

拉尼尔被逗得哈哈大笑不已。戴弗一家又拧成了一股绳，团结在了一起……迪克嘴上没说，但心里在想：这样的情况以后还能出现多少次？





第五章


尼科尔走到窗口，趴在窗台上查看楼下露台上的情况——那儿有人在吵架，越吵越凶。但见四月的阳光照在厨娘奥古斯汀的那张神圣的脸上，发出粉红色的光彩，而她手中像醉汉一样挥舞着的切菜刀则闪着蓝幽幽的光芒。自从他们二月里回到黛安娜别墅，这位厨娘就跟他们在一起生活了。

因为有遮篷挡着，尼科尔只能看见迪克的头和一只手（那只手紧握他那根沉甸甸的铜柄手杖）。那两人，一个持菜刀，一个拿手杖，彼此虎视眈眈，活像两个角斗士用长矛和短剑对峙。迪克的声音先传到她的耳朵里：“不管你在厨房里偷喝了多少酒，但是，要是让我发现你把手伸向沙布利——穆顿酒……”

“亏你还说别人喝酒！”奥古斯汀挥舞着菜刀，大喊大叫，“你自己才是个酒鬼，一天到晚喝个不停！”

尼科尔隔着遮篷冲楼下喊道：“怎么啦，迪克？”

迪克用英语回答：“这老婆子快把那些好酒喝光了。我要辞掉她……至少过后我会这么做的。”

“天哪！别让她用刀伤着你。”

奥古斯汀朝尼科尔晃了晃菜刀，两片嘴唇红红的，就像两颗紧挨着的红樱桃。

“我要说，太太，你要是知道你丈夫在他的小屋里喝得醉醺醺的，就像个出苦力的下等人……”

“闭嘴，滚出去！”尼科尔喝住了她，“我们要叫警察了。”

“你们还叫警察呢！我弟弟就是警察！你这个可恶的美国佬还叫警察？”

迪克用英语朝尼科尔喊道：“把孩子们从家里带走，让我来解决此事！”

“可恶的美国佬，跑到我们国家来，把我们的好酒都喝光啦！”奥古斯汀亮开泼妇的嗓门尖叫着。

迪克用更大的嗓门喝道：“你现在就给我走！欠你的工钱会付给你的。”

“你当然得付工钱！让我告诉你吧……”她逼上前去，狂怒地挥舞着菜刀，而迪克举起了手杖。她反身冲到厨房里，拿来一把切肉刀，外加一柄小斧子。

情况不容乐观——奥古斯汀是个强壮的妇人，要夺走她手里的刀斧，很可能会给她造成伤害，而伤害了一个法国公民，势必会陷入重重的法律纠纷。迪克想吓唬吓唬她，便仰起头对尼科尔喊道：“你打电话报警！”随后，他指着奥古斯汀的武器说：“凭这些就可以把你抓起来。”

“哈哈哈！”她狂笑不已，然而却不再往前逼进了。尼科尔给警察局打了电话，听到的却是和奥古斯汀的怪笑差不多的声音——话筒里传来一阵呜里哇啦的说话声和含糊不清的低语，后来电话就突然断了。

尼科尔折回到窗口，向下冲着迪克叫道：“多给她点钱，让她走吧！”

迪克原指望能打电话报警，而现在看来已不可能，只好妥协让步，只盼着赶快让她走，便把原来的五十法郎增加到了一百法郎。奥古斯汀放弃了自己的阵地，开始撤退，口里仍连声骂“不识抬举的东西！”，就像是抛了一堆手榴弹掩护自己的撤退。接下来，她仍不肯离去，非得等她的侄子前来帮她拿行李。迪克怀着警惕之心守在厨房跟前，听见她拔酒瓶塞喝酒的声音也不去管了。这之后没有再起风波……那位侄子来后，一再表示歉意。奥古斯汀也换上了一副欢快的表情，乐呵呵地跟迪克告别，还冲着尼科尔的窗户喊道：“再见，夫人！祝你好运！”

事后，戴弗夫妇去了尼斯，在餐馆吃了一顿法式马赛鱼汤，这道汤是用石头鱼和小龙虾煨的，用藏红花作佐料调味，以一瓶冰镇沙布利干白葡萄酒佐餐。迪克对奥古斯汀的离去表示惋惜。

“我可一点也不惋惜。”尼科尔说。

“我觉得惋惜嘛……那是因为我没能把她从悬崖上推下去。”

这些天来，他们俩谁都不敢多说话，常常觉得说出的话词不达意，彼此之间很难做到心心相通。今晚，奥古斯汀的那一顿发作令他们震惊，使他们不再沉湎于各自的心事，再加上喝着热乎乎的加了香料的鱼汤和有着灼热感的美酒，二人便推心置腹交谈了起来。

“咱们不能这样下去了，”尼科尔开口说道，“难道不是吗？你说呢？”迪克一时间没有表示否定，这叫她感到意外，“有时我觉得都怪我……是我毁了你。”

“这么说我已被毁了，是不是？”他打趣道。

“我不是那个意思，但我觉得你过去有创造的欲望，而如今似乎恨不得把这个世界砸得粉碎。”

她对自己如此直言不讳地批评他感到有点不安，而对方久久不说话，这就更让她不安了。她觉得他缄口不语，其中必有原因，那双冷峻的蓝眼睛后面似乎隐藏着什么，而他对孩子们表现出的浓厚兴趣有些不自然，这里面可能别有文章。他有时会一反常态，大发脾气，令她愕然——他会突然滔滔不绝地表示内心的鄙视，贬斥某个人、某个种族、某个阶级、某种生活方式和某种思维模式。就好像他的内心深处有着无穷的心事，一朝爆发，才让她有所醒悟。

“你到底心里是怎么想的？”她问。

“我只知道你的身体一天天好起来，知道你的病遵循的是‘病来如山倒，病去如抽丝’的定律。”

他的声音听起来是那么遥远，仿佛在讲解与此风马牛不相及的学术问题，惊得她不由大叫了一声“迪克！”，同时隔着桌子去抓他的手。迪克却条件反射似的把手抽了回去，说道：“事无巨细，需要通盘考虑，是不是？这不仅仅是你一个人的问题。”随后，他握住她的手，像一个寻欢作乐的阴谋家用一种插科打诨的语气，油腔滑调地说：“看见远处的那艘船了吗？”

那是T.F.戈尔丁的摩托游艇，静静地停泊在尼斯湾的海面上，随海浪一起一伏，虽然停在原处未动，却好像是在做一次浪漫的航行。“咱们可以到那儿去做个调查，看船上的人是不是幸福。”

“咱们和戈尔丁又不熟！”尼科尔不想去。

“他巴不得咱们去呢。再说，芭比跟他熟就够了。事实上，她差点嫁给了他，不是吗？她以前没嫁给他吗？”

于是，他们租了一艘小艇，出了港口，向戈尔丁的那艘“马金”号游艇驶去。此时已是夏日的黄昏时分，但见“马金”号游艇上的索具间灯光闪烁，星星点点透出来。到了跟前，尼科尔又犹豫了起来，说道：“他在开派对……”

“那只是收音机的声音。”迪克猜测说。

有人在招呼他们——一个穿白色外套，身材魁梧，满头银丝的男子从船上低头望着他们，叫道：“是戴弗夫妇吗？”

“欢迎！欢迎光临‘马金’号游艇！”

迪克他们的小艇停靠在了游艇的舷梯下。他们往上走时，戈尔丁弯下他那魁梧的身躯，对尼科尔伸出手说：“正赶上晚宴。”

一支小乐队正在游艇的后甲板演奏：

只要你开口，

我就是你的……

但不到那一天，你别指望我……

戈尔丁张开双臂，却没有拥抱他们，而是将他们朝后甲板引。尼科尔后悔得不得了，觉得不该到这儿来，因而对迪克也越加不耐烦了。由于迪克的工作原因以及她的健康原因，他们不再适合四处交游，于是便渐渐疏远了这些寻欢作乐的人，为自己赢得了“世外高人”的美名。在这几年，里维埃拉的后起之秀们则认为他们如此做派是一种不受欢迎的表现。然而，既然已亮明了这样的人生态度，尼科尔认为就不应该因为一时放纵而使其毁于一旦。

通过主舱时，他们看见前方圆形的舱尾处有些人影在晃动，似乎是在半明半暗的灯光下跳舞。其实，这只是由于悦耳的音乐、迷离的灯光以及海浪的起伏的原因，所产生的幻觉。事实是：有几个服务生在那儿忙碌，还有几个客人闲坐在一张宽宽的沙发上（那沙发安放在弧形甲板的转弯处），有的穿白衣服，有的穿红衣服，有的人的衣服辨不清是什么颜色，有的西装革履，穿得笔挺。突然，其中的一个客人站起来，做了自我介绍，使得尼科尔喜出望外，叫出了声：“汤米！”

汤米原想按法国人的礼仪吻一下她的手，谁知她抢先一步，把她的脸贴在了汤米的脸上。他们在一条古罗马式长凳上坐了下来，或者不如说斜躺了下来。他英俊的面孔黑黝黝的，已经看不见了过去的那种晒出来的悦目的古铜色，而他脸上的这种黑又不是黑人的那种发亮的漂亮的黑色，却是一种憔悴的脸色。异国的太阳改变了他的肤色，他乡的水土给他提供了养分，而今的他由于受到多种地方话的干扰，说话舌头打结，举动有些怪异，令人惊奇。正是这些因素使尼科尔着迷，心醉——二人刚一见面，她在精神层面便投入了他的怀抱，和他远走高飞了……后来，她倏然清醒，回到了现实世界，又恢复了原来的样子，轻描淡写地说：“你看上去简直就像是电影里的冒险家……你为什么一走就是这么长时间？”

汤米·巴尔班看看她，不明白她的意思，但有所警觉，于是两眼不由闪射出异彩。

“五年了，”她继续说道，声音低沉，像是没由来的模仿，“时间太长了。你怎么就不能在外边杀死几头猛兽，然后回来歇口气呢？”

在心上人面前，汤米迅速地使自己欧化了，用法语说道：“对我们这些英雄而言，需要长时间的磨炼，尼科尔。我们可不是在干鸡毛蒜皮的小事，而是在从事惊天动地的事业。”

“请跟我讲英语，汤米！”

“请跟我讲法语，尼科尔！”

“用法语说和用英语说，意思是不一样的——用法语说，你会显得英雄、豪迈，同时有高贵的气质，这你清楚；而用英语说，你可以表现出英雄气概和豪情壮志，然而却显得有点可笑，这你也清楚。这恐怕会给我以可乘之机呦。”

汤米突然忍俊不禁，咯咯一笑，说道：“不管怎么都是一样的。即便用英语说，我也会有英雄的气概和凌云的壮志。”

她装出一副不胜惊讶的样子，而他毫无愧色。

“我只知道电影里的英雄都是这样的。”他说。

“这是不是都像演电影一样呀？”

“那些表现英雄的电影真是不错……罗纳德·科尔曼[11]就是一个顶天立地的英雄。你看过他演的反映北非军团的影片吗？这些都是顶呱呱的好片子。”

“好呀，要是去看电影，那我就知道你和影片中的英雄一样在干着惊天地泣鬼神的事业哟。”

尼科尔说话的时候，注意到一位小巧、白净、漂亮的年轻女子，一头秀发油光发亮，在甲板灯光的照射下，近似一种绿色。那女子先前坐在汤米的旁边，很可能一直在同汤米或边上的另一个人说话。显然，汤米刚才把注意力都集中在了那女子身上，此时却分了心。这叫那个女子大失所望，于是有些失态，恼怒地走到月牙形甲板的另一头去了。

“毕竟，我是个英雄嘛，”汤米不动声色地说，语气像是在开玩笑，又像是认真的，“我有着熊心豹胆，通常情况下，有几分像雄狮，又有几分像醉汉。”

尼科尔耐心地等待着，等待着他的那种夸夸其谈的英雄豪气逐渐消退——她知道他以前可能从未这般说过话。她打量了一下那些陌生人，结果发现那些人也是神经质，故作镇静，只是因为害怕城市才躲到了乡下，说话把调门定得高高的、语气狠狠的……

“那个穿白衣服的女子是何人？”她问道。

“刚才坐在我身边的那个？那是卡罗琳·西布利-比尔斯夫人。”他们静下来，听了一会儿她在甲板另一头说话的声音：

“那家伙是个无赖，手气很差。我们打了一通宵‘双决十一点’[12]，他还欠我一千瑞士法郎呢。”

汤米笑着说：“她现在可是伦敦天字号的恶女。我每次回欧洲，总会遇上这样一帮来自伦敦的恶女。她是我最近才遇到的一个……不过，我觉得眼下又碰到一个，恐怕也是同样的凶恶。”

尼科尔又望了一眼甲板那头的女子——她身材纤弱，像是患有结核病……让人难以置信，如此瘦削的双肩，如此细弱的手臂，竟能举起象征着颓废的大旗（即没落帝国的最后一种标志）。她看上去有点像战前就为画家和小说家做模特的那种慵懒的高个金发女郎，但更像约翰·海德[13]漫画中的胸脯平平的轻浮少女。

戈尔丁走了过来，尽量压低他那庞大身躯所发出的洪亮的声音，仿佛是在用一架大型扩音器表达自己的想法。尼科尔虽然不情愿，但还是听从了他一再强调的建议：晚宴后，“马金”号立即驶往戛纳。他们尽管已经吃了晚餐，但可以再吃点鱼子酱，喝点香槟酒。不管怎样吧，反正迪克现在已经在给他们在尼斯的司机打电话了，让司机把车开回戛纳，停在艾利斯咖啡馆门口——这样，他和尼科尔就可以在那儿找到他们的车。

大家走进餐厅，迪克被安排在西布利——比尔斯夫人身边。尼科尔看见他平日里红润的脸失去了血色。他说话时语调强硬，但尼科尔只能断断续续地听到一些：“你们英国人就是这样，喜欢过醉生梦死的生活……在几成废墟的城堡里，我是说在城堡门口安排几个印度兵把门，里面却是笙歌燕舞。今日有酒今日醉，哪还管明天如何！”

卡罗琳夫人回答时话不多，多半用“什么？”来结尾，夹杂着模棱两可的“是呀！”，抑或令人沮丧的“好吗！”。她的话给人以“山雨欲来风满楼”的感觉，而迪克显然没注意到这些警示。后来，他突然慷慨陈词，发表了一通言辞激烈的议论。尼科尔听不清他说些什么，但却看见那个年轻女子脸色铁青，怒容满面，听见她厉声回答：“外人说外人的话，朋友说朋友的话！”

他又得罪人了！难道他就不能管一管他的嘴吗？什么时候才能改呢？恐怕到死都改不了了！

在钢琴边，乐队（该乐队以打击乐器为名，叫作“爱丁堡拉格泰姆学院爵士乐队”）的一个苏格兰金发小伙子开始用《丹尼·德弗》[14]的那种平音，随着钢琴弹出的低调唱起歌来。他歌声悠扬，字正腔圆，仿佛那歌词深深印在心间。

一个年轻女子从地狱来，

一听丧钟就高兴得跳起来，

因为她坏、坏、坏，

一听丧钟就高兴得跳起来，

从地狱来（咚咚锵）

从地狱来（锵咚咚）

一个年轻女子从地狱来……

“他唱的是什么歌？”汤米低声问尼科尔。

一个坐在他另一边的女孩代为回答说：“那是卡罗琳·西布利-比尔斯夫人作的词，他自己谱的曲。”

接下来，歌手开始唱第二段歌曲，似乎还要唱那位跳跃的女子。汤米禁不住嘟哝了一声：“多好呀！就像是在吟诵拉辛[15]的台词！”

至少从表面看，卡罗琳夫人并没有在意别人在演唱她的作品。尼科尔又看了她一眼，发现自己倒是注意上了她，不是注意她的特征或个性，而是注意到她的态度有一种咄咄逼人的力量，暗想此人绝非好对付的人。众人从餐桌旁站起时，她的看法得到了证实。这时，迪克坐着没动，表情有些异常，猛不丁就冷言冷语地来了一句：“英国人就喜欢叽叽咕咕地嘟哝，含沙射影，聒噪得人心烦又讨厌！”

卡罗琳夫人已经快走出餐厅了，一听这话便转身回来，走到他跟前，声音清晰，斩钉截铁地说（这样是让大伙儿都能听得到）：“你来是找碴的，又是诽谤我的同胞，又是诋毁我的朋友玛丽·明盖蒂。恕我直言，有人看见你在洛桑跟一群不三不四的人鬼混。那算不算聒噪呢？是不是让人心烦呢？”

“反正还不够聒噪吧。”迪克愣了一会儿才说，“看来，我已经臭名远扬了……”

戈尔丁说了声“好啦！好啦！”，终止了他的饶舌。说完，他晃动着强健的身躯，招呼客人们往外走。走到门口，尼科尔回头看见迪克仍坐在餐桌旁。她对那个女人出言不逊感到气愤，同时也在生迪克的气，怪他不该带她到这里来，不该喝得醉醺醺的，不该对别人冷嘲热讽，弄得他自己却反受其辱。她情知自己一来就吸引了汤米·巴尔班，结果惹恼了那个英国女人，这些也叫她越想越气。

过了一会儿，她见迪克出现在了舷梯口，正站在那儿同戈尔丁说话，显然已完全镇静下来了。在后来的半个小时里，甲板上不见了他的身影，于是她便和汤米一道用细绳和咖啡豆玩一种复杂的马来游戏。末了，她对汤米说：“我去找一下迪克。”

自打晚餐后，游艇就一直向西航行。迷人的夜色从船舷两旁掠过，柴油发动机发出噗噗噗轻微的声响。她来到船头，春风拂面，吹乱了她的头发。她看见迪克站在旗杆旁边，猛然一惊，为他感到担心。而迪克认出是她，却平淡地说：“夜色真美呀。”

“我为你担心。”

“哦，你担心了吗？”

“唉，别这样说话。要是我能为你做一点什么，我会感到非常快乐的，迪克。”

他转过身去，抬头仰望着非洲上空那点点的繁星。

“我相信这是真话，尼科尔。我有时还以为你能为我做的事越少，就越高兴呢。”

“别这样说话……别谈这些了。”

大海翻起白浪，而白浪反射着明亮的星月之光——但见他脸色苍白，然而却没有恼怒的表情（她原以为他会生气）。他甚至显得有些超然物外，目光慢慢地落在了她身上，就像弈棋人将一枚棋子慢慢地放在了棋盘上。以同样缓慢的动作，他抓住她的手腕，把她拉到跟前，温和地说：“你毁了我，对不对？咱俩都完了。所以不如……”

她惊出了一身冷汗，然而却把另一只手也伸过去让他抓住。好吧，那就来个一了百了，她会跟着他走的……就在她决定彻底放弃生命的那一瞬间，她又一次感到夜色是如此迷人……好吧，那就来个一了百了吧……

谁知就在这当儿，迪克却出人意料之外地松开了她的手腕，将身子扭转开，唉声叹气，连连叹息。

尼科尔泪流满面……过了一会儿，她听见有人走了过来。

来人是汤米，冲他们说道：“你找到他了！那个英国小荡妇辱骂了你，尼科尔以为你要跳海呢，迪克。”

“在这个地方跳海倒是挺不错的。”迪克淡淡地说。

“谁说不是呢？”尼科尔接口说道，“咱们借个救生圈，跳下去得了。我觉得咱们应该有惊人之举，因为这日子活得也太拘谨了。”

汤米把他们好一番打量，看看这个，再看看那个，想弄清楚他们在这夜色里演什么戏，最后说道：“咱们不妨去请教一下西布利——比尔斯夫人，看她有什么时新的玩法。还记得她写的歌曲《一个年轻女子从地狱来》吧？我准备把它翻译出来，让它在娱乐场走红，成为我的摇钱树。”

“你很富有吗，汤米？”走到甲板的另一头时，迪克冷不丁问道。

“目前还不富。我玩股票，后来玩烦了，就不干了。不过，我有一些好股票在朋友手里，让他们替我经管，行情挺不错的。”

“迪克可是越来越富了。”尼科尔说道。说话时，她的声音有点发抖。

在后甲板，戈尔丁正挥动着他那巨大的手，敦促三对男女跳舞。尼科尔和汤米也加入了他们的行列。汤米在一旁说：“迪克看上去就像喝了酒。”

“他只喝了一点儿。”尼科尔替丈夫解释道。

“有的人能喝酒，有的人不能喝。迪克显然是不能喝的。你应该劝他别喝了。”

“让我劝！？”她惊奇地叫了起来，“你让我告诉迪克什么该做，什么不该做！？”

抵达戛纳码头时，迪克默默寡语，仍迷迷糊糊，睡眼蒙眬。戈尔丁扶他下了“马金”号游艇，而卡罗琳夫人惹人注目地挪了挪位置。到了码头上，迪克以夸张的姿态向她鞠躬告别，似乎还想说句俏皮的话祝她一路顺风，却被汤米用胳膊肘碰了碰腰眼，于是他们朝着停放在马路边的汽车走去。

“我开车送你们回家。”汤米提议说。

“不麻烦了……我们可以叫一辆出租车。”

“要是你们能留我过夜，我很乐意送你们。”

迪克坐在汽车后座上，一声也不吭。汽车驶过瑞昂湾的那块黄色的独石柱，又经过了瑞昂莱藩那昼夜开放的游乐场（一入夜，这儿便音乐袅袅，人语喧哗，各种各样的语言都有）。汽车拐弯爬上山坡向塔姆斯驶去时，车身一斜，而他突然坐直了身子，发表了一通议论。

“好一个英国人的代表……”他一时结巴了起来，“代表的是那么一群人……一群傻头傻脑的英国人。”说完，他便安然入睡了，时不时舒服地打几个酒嗝，让酒气飘散到柔和、温馨的夜色里。





第六章


次日，迪克一大早就来到了尼科尔的房间，说道：“我一直在等着，听见你起床了才进来的。不用说，昨晚的事叫我感到糟透了……过去的事情就不提了，好吗？”

“好的。”她冷冷地回答，一边照着镜子。

“汤米开车送咱们回来的吧？要不，这是我梦中梦见的？”

“你知道是他送咱们回来的。”

“看来是这样的，”他承认道，“因为我刚才还听见他的咳嗽声了。我想我该去看看他。”

他离开她，倒叫她感到几分高兴——她破天荒第一遭发现他的那种刻意追求完美的风范似乎最终已不复存在。

汤米还赖在床上，等待仆人给他送牛奶咖啡。

“感觉还好吧？”迪克问他。

一听说他嗓子疼，迪克立刻摆出了医生的姿态，说道：“最好含一口漱口液什么的。”

“你有吗？”

“说来也怪，我没有，尼科尔倒可能有。”

“别打搅她了。”

“她已经起来了。”

“她的情况怎么样？”

迪克慢慢转过身去，以调侃的语气说：“你以为我喝醉了酒她就会死吗？她可是用佐治亚的松木做成的——除了新西兰的铁梨木，那可是天下最坚硬的木材。”

尼科尔下楼时正好听到了这最后几句话。她清楚，并且一直都很清楚汤米爱她，因为爱她汤米讨厌上了迪克。迪克早就对此心知肚明，一定会采取相应的措施回应汤米的痴情。她想到这里，心头不由产生了女性的那种满足感。只见她双肘架在孩子们的早餐桌上，对家庭女教师交代着事情，而此时此刻楼上有两个男人在为她牵肠挂肚。

稍后来到花园里，她心中仍充满了幸福感。她并不想让自己的生活横起波澜，只想让目前的状况持续下去，想让那两个男人为了她而暗暗较劲。已经有好久没人关注过她了，就好像她压根不存在似的，甚至还不如一花一草。

“这感觉真好，小兔子乖乖，你说是不是？嘿，小兔子乖乖，你说呀！你说这感觉好不好？到底好不好呀？难道这话你听上去很怪吗？”

实际上，那兔子哪里听得懂，只认她喂的白菜叶子，抽动了几下鼻子，算是表示同意了。

尼科尔在花园里继续侍花弄草，将剪下的鲜花放在指定的地方，好让花匠稍后拿到屋子里去。走到海堤边的时候，她很想找个人说说话，但苦于无人跟她交谈。于是，她停住脚步，想起了自己的心事，想起了她对另一个男人所产生的感情。这种婚外恋难免叫她有点心惊肉跳……可是，别的女人能有情人，她为何不可？在这个清新的春天的早晨，通向男性世界的种种壁垒全都消失了，她心潮澎湃，一颗心像鲜花一样怒放。风儿吹拂着她的头发，而她的头随风微微晃动。别的女人能有情人，她为何不可？昨晚，在一股力量的激励下，她愿意跟迪克一道走向死亡，而现在，也是这种力量使得她微微随风晃动着头，觉得自己有情人是顺理成章的事，并为这种逻辑感到满足和欣慰。

她坐在矮墙上，俯视着大海，心里也如大海一样波翻浪涌。在幻想世界的大海里，她钓起了一样东西，把它和其他的捕获物放在了一起。如果说在精神层面她没必要始终如一地只属于迪克，就像昨晚那样，那她就应该有另外一种形象，而不仅仅是他心目中的那种，满足于围着一枚奖章无休无止地转圈圈。

她之所以挑了这处矮墙坐下来——是因为此处的悬崖旁有一个斜坡，坡上有草地和一个菜园子。透过一簇簇枝叶，她看见两个男子手持耙子和铁锹在干活，一边还用尼斯土话和普罗旺斯[16]方言闲聊着。根据他们说的话以及做出的手势，她也能明白他们的意思。

“我是在这儿把她放倒的。”

“我把她带到那边的葡萄架后面。”

“她不在乎……他也不在乎。那可是条神圣的母狗呀。哦，我把她在这儿按倒后……”

“你带耙子了吗？”

“你自己不是有么。你这个小丑。”

“唉，我才不管你在哪儿把她按倒了呢。自从结婚一直到那天晚上，我甚至连女人的乳房贴在我胸口的滋味都没有尝过……都十二年了。现在你却跟我讲什么……”

“还是请你听我讲讲那条母狗吧……”

尼科尔透过枝叶注视着他们，觉得他们说的话自有其中的道理——仁者见仁智者见智嘛。而那可是她偷听到的男人间的体己话！回到家时，她又想起了自己的心事。

迪克和汤米在露台上。她从他们身边走过进了屋子，拿来一个画板，开始为汤米画头像。

“双手从不停歇，忙忙碌碌如飞梭。”迪克随便说了一句——他脸上仍没有血色，胡子上沾着褐色的肥皂沫，双眼发红。

尼科尔觉得他的话十分无聊，没加以理会，而是冲着汤米说道：“我总是忙忙碌碌的。我曾养过一只活泼可爱的波利尼西亚[17]小猴子，喜欢逗它玩，一玩就是老半天，弄得有人都拿我当笑柄了，冷言冷语的……”

她说话时，眼睛有意不看迪克。过了一会儿，迪克借故进屋去了……她看见他给自己倒了两杯水，像是在躲她，于是心里越发凉了。

“尼科尔……”汤米刚要说什么，却停了下来，清了清嗓子。

“我去给你拿一种特殊的樟脑药膏，”她说，“是美国货，迪克很相信它的疗效。我马上就来。”

“我真的该走了。”

迪克走出屋子坐了下来，问汤米道：“说我相信什么？”尼科尔拿着药瓶回来时，那两人坐着连动也没动。不过，看得出他们之间有过激烈的交谈，具体谈的是什么就不得而知了。

司机站在门口，手里拎着一个包，里面装的是汤米昨夜换下来的衣服。看见汤米穿着向迪克借来的衣服，她觉得很不是滋味，仿佛汤米买不起这种衣服似的。

“你回到旅馆，把这药涂在咽喉和胸脯上，然后吸几口樟脑气味。”她交代道。

“喂，等一等，”当汤米走下台阶时，迪克咕哝道，“别把整瓶药都给了汤米……这药得从巴黎订购……家里没这种药了。”

汤米又走了回来，到了能听见他说话的地方。三个人就这么呆呆地站在大太阳底下。汤米雄赳赳立于汽车前头，看那劲头就好像一弯腰就能够将汽车举起来放在背上。

尼科尔走下台阶来到路边，对他说道：“你只管拿着就是了。这种药很稀罕，很贵重。”

迪克来到她身边，一句话也没说，而她躲开了一步。汽车开走时，她冲着汤米以及那瓶贵重的樟脑药膏挥手告别。随后，她便回屋去服她自己的药了。

“没必要装大方，”迪克说，“咱们家里有四口人……几年来，只要有人咳嗽……”

他们彼此看了一眼。

“咱们总能再弄到一瓶的……”她有点心慌意乱，跟在迪克身后上了楼。一进房间，迪克就躺在了他的床上，一句话也没有再说。

“你想把午餐端上来吃吗？”她问。

他点点头，仍然一句话也不说，眼睛直勾勾望着天花板。她满怀心事地下楼张罗去了。回到楼上时，她探头朝他的房间里看了看，发现他的一双蓝眼睛睁得大大的，像夜空中的两束探照灯光。她在门口站了一会儿，觉得自己有罪于他，有点不敢进去……后来她走过去伸出手，似乎要摸他的头，而他急忙躲开了，就像一只疑心很重的动物。她再也忍受不了了，转身冲到了楼下，一如惊恐万状的小鹿，生怕楼上的那个受到打击的男人把她当作牺牲品，而她还傻傻地依偎在他那干瘪的胸脯上。

一个星期后，尼科尔已淡忘了她对汤米所产生过的激情——她不大记人。人一走她就忘。但是在六月份乍热的时候，她听说汤米到了尼斯，还写了一封短信给他们俩。她在遮阳伞下把这封信连同另外几封从家里带来的信件一道拆开，看完这封后便随手抛给了迪克，而迪克也把一封电报扔到了她那穿着沙滩休闲装的膝上。电文如下：

我明天到高斯，很遗憾家母不能同去。希望能见到你们。

——罗斯玛丽

“我很愿意见见她。”尼科尔冷冷地说。





第七章


次日上午，她随迪克去海滩那儿的时候，心中再生忧虑，害怕迪克采取极端措施。自从那天晚上在戈尔丁的游艇上经历了一场风波，她便忐忑不安，有了这种感觉。目前的情况比较微妙，必须保持平衡，一边是四平八稳地过日子，可保人身安全，另一边则是危险，纵身一跳就可能会粉身碎骨，这叫她想都不敢想。她和迪克都在变，变得面目全非、奇形怪状，有点像荒诞舞会上的幽灵。几个月来，迪克每说一句话似乎都有弦外之音，不久便可以由他用实际行动加以澄清。也许，这种心理状态对她反而更有益处——童年的病痛扼杀了她的一部分活跃的天性，而多年婚后的生活渐渐激活了受损的天性，这些是迪克没有觉察到的。这也不能怪他，因为了解一个人的心理世界谈何容易！这种情况的出现喜忧参半。最令人担忧的是迪克对她越来越冷淡，目前表现为嗜酒贪杯，借酒浇愁。她真不知自己会有怎样的结局，不知自己是会被摧毁还是得以解脱——迪克说话缺乏真诚，让人摸不透他在想什么。迪克似乎在慢吞吞地展开一条魔毯，简直慢得出奇，真不知他葫芦里卖的是什么药，不知她从魔毯上跳下来会有什么样的下场。

至于以后会出现什么样的情况，她并不担心——她猜想那将会是卸掉一个包袱，是重新睁开眼睛看世界。尼科尔天生就喜欢变化，喜欢遨游于大海，喜欢飞翔于天空，而金钱就是她遨游的鱼鳍和飞翔的翅膀。目前的状况说到底就像是一只赛车底盘，多年藏身于一辆家用轿车的车身下，但终究会拆卸下来，一朝露峥嵘，驰骋于赛场。尼科尔已经感到清新的风扑面而来——她只是害怕变化来得太突然，来得太惨烈。

他们两口子到了海滩上。她穿了一套白色的泳衣，迪克穿一条白色游泳裤——他们的衣服在他们身体肤色的反衬下，显得格外的白。她看见迪克在杂乱的人群中和许多遮阳伞的阴影间东张西望，在寻找他们的孩子。当他的心思暂时不在她身上、不再纠缠她时，她就可以冷静地观察他了，断定他找孩子不是要保护他们，而是在寻求自我保护。也许他害怕海滩，犹如一位被废黜的君王此时偷偷跑来，是要看一眼自己昔日的宫殿。她讨厌他那谈笑风雅、彬彬有礼的世界，全然忘了在许多年里对她敞开大门的唯有此处。就让他好好看吧——他的海滩已失去了往日的风采，成了一些无品味人士的乐园！他就是找上一整天，也找不到他从前像建筑中国的长城那样建起的围墙了，找不到老朋友们的足印了。

一时间，尼科尔有些伤感，想起了他怎样从废物堆里扒拉出来了那只玻璃杯；想起了他们在尼斯的一条小街上买水手衫和水手裤的情景（这种款式后来被巴黎的女服装设计师采用，做成了丝绸衣服，红红火火地流行了一阵）；想起了天真的法国小姑娘怎样爬上防波堤，大喊大叫“喂！喂！”，像鸟儿一样自由；想起了他们在早晨举行的仪式，一颗心宁静、安详，充满了对大海和太阳的向往……谁知才过了几年，他的诸多发明就被深深地埋在了沙子里。

如今，他们游泳的地方变身成了“俱乐部”，有着国际社会的范儿，很难说谁可以入内谁不可以入内。

这时，尼科尔见迪克跪在草席上，在用目光寻找罗斯玛丽，于是她的一颗刚热了一点的心就又凉了。顺着他的目光，她的眼睛扫视着那些新搭起的凉棚、水上秋千、吊环、简易更衣室、浮塔、昨日晚会用过的探照灯以及装有无数把手的时髦白色餐柜。

他几乎最后才朝海上看了看，因为那儿是最不可能找到罗斯玛丽的地方——除了几个孩子和一个男仆，很少再有人到那片天堂一般的蓝色海水里游泳了。若说那个男仆，他只是喜欢出风头，上午准会爬上一块五十英尺高的岩石，来几个高台跳水，亮一亮优美的跳水姿势。绝大多数高斯旅馆的客人只是在下午一点钟的时候，才脱掉浴衣，露出一身虚肉，跳进海水里泡上一小会儿。

“她在那儿。”尼科尔说道。

她望着迪克的眼睛，而迪克的目光却在寻找罗斯玛丽，从一张筏子寻到另一张筏子。看到这情景，她不由一声长叹（这一声叹息五年前就埋藏在了心里，一直到了今日）。

“咱们游过去，跟罗斯玛丽聊聊吧。”迪克提议。

“你去吧。”

“咱俩都去吧。”

她犹豫了片刻，但最后还是同意了。于是，他们俩跟在一群小鱼的后边游了过去，而那群小鱼则追随着罗斯玛丽——罗斯玛丽就像一个闪闪发亮的匙形鱼钩，那亮光照花了他们的眼。

到了跟前，尼科尔仍待在海水里，迪克则爬上筏子，来到了罗斯玛丽身边。他们俩坐在一起，身上水淋淋的，聊了起来，就好像他们从未相爱过，从未相互抚摸过一样。罗斯玛丽很美，身上焕发出的青春活力令尼科尔颇为震撼，但同时也窃窃自喜，觉得罗斯玛丽不如她苗条，腰围稍微比她粗一点儿。尼科尔围着筏子一边游泳一边听罗斯玛丽说话——罗斯玛丽兴致勃勃，乐观开朗，对未来充满了希望，比五年前要自信多了。

“我很想妈妈，但她在巴黎等我，下星期一才能见面。”

“五年前你来这儿时还是个黄毛丫头，穿着一件旅馆的晨衣，特别有意思！”迪克说。

“你的记忆力真好！美好的事情你总能记得很清楚。”

尼科尔见她故技重演，又开始奉承起迪克，于是便一头潜到水下，随后又浮出了水面，只听罗斯玛丽在说：“我真希望能回到五年前，自己还是一个十八岁的女孩。你和尼科尔总给我一种亲切感，让我觉得欢乐、幸福。我觉得你们好像仍跟从前那样坐在那边沙滩上的一把遮阳伞下……你们是我认识的最可爱的人，也许永远如此。”

尼科尔游开了。她看得出迪克在和罗斯玛丽谈笑时，心中的阴霾有所消散，又拿出了他在交际场上的看家本事——一种都快生了锈的交际艺术。她心想：他如果能喝上一杯酒，八成会为罗斯玛丽表演几个吊环动作（以前他表演这些动作不在话下，现在可能会有些吃力）。今年夏天她留意到，他第一次对高台跳水有了畏惧之心。

她想着心事，从一个筏子游向另一个筏子，越游越远。迪克从后边赶过来说：“罗斯玛丽的朋友有一艘快艇，就在那边。你想乘滑水板滑行吗？我想一定很好玩的。”

记得有一次，他在一块滑板的末端放了一把椅子，自己在椅子上做倒立。她迁就他，就如同她也会迁就拉尼尔一样。去年夏天在苏黎世湖，他们玩过那种有趣的水上游戏，迪克还从滑板上举起一个重两百磅的男子放在肩上，直直地站在那里。女人嫁人图的是对方有某种才能，这是很自然的，但婚后做丈夫的再炫耀他们的才能，她们就不会太感兴趣了。尼科尔非但不感兴趣，甚至连装也不想装，只是胡乱支吾着：“是呀，我想也是的。”

她知道他有些累了，只是由于年轻动人的罗斯玛丽近在身边，才鼓舞着他跃跃欲试——她曾见他从她新生的婴儿身上汲取过同样的力量，此时冷眼旁观，真不知他会不会当众出丑。戴弗夫妇比快艇上的其他人都要年长些。那些年轻人有礼貌，态度恭敬，但尼科尔心中却暗自嘀咕，“这都是些什么人”，她怀念以前迪克善于控制场面，善于让人们尊敬他们的天赋……此刻的迪克正专注于眼前的事情，准备一鸣惊人。

快艇在离海岸两百码的地方开始减速，一位年轻人从船舷边猛地跳入水里，朝那块随海浪东摇西晃、上下颠簸的滑水板游去，把它稳住后，然后慢慢爬上去跪在上面。快艇加速时，他站立起来，身体后仰，生硬地操纵着轻巧的滑水板，使其左右来回摆动，缓慢而又费劲地做着弧形运动，每一个弧形动作结束时，滑板都会压在快艇激起的边浪上。后来，在快艇尾波的直接冲击下，他放开了手中的绳子，身体晃了晃想保持平衡，随即便朝后一歪，扑通一声跌入水中，就像一尊石像沉入水底一样。快艇绕了一圈回来时，他又现身了，露出了一个小小的脑袋。

轮到尼科尔的时候，她拒绝了。罗斯玛丽上了滑水板，做的动作利落、稳健，赢得了仰慕者们的阵阵欢呼和喝彩。她回到艇上时，其中的三个仰慕者争先恐后拉她，抢着要将这份荣耀争取到手，结果使得她的膝盖和髋部碰在船舷上，碰得青紫。

“现在该你了，医生。”驾驶快艇的那个墨西哥人说。

迪克和最后一个年轻人跳下水向滑水板游去。迪克要表演的是他的那套举人的技艺，尼科尔冷眼旁观，脸上挂着蔑视的微笑。这场特意为罗斯玛丽举办的体能表演令她怒不可遏。

那两人滑了许久才掌握住平衡。迪克跪着，将脖子伸到另一个人的胯下，从大腿间抓住了绳子，然后慢慢地开始站起来。

快艇上的人全神贯注地观看，他们发现他做这套动作有点吃力。他跪着一条腿，需要从跪姿到直立起身子的整套动作一气呵成。他歇了一会儿，随后咬紧牙关，使出全身力气奋力一举。

滑水板很窄，被举的那个年轻人尽管体重不足一百五十磅，然而由于掌握不了平衡，便笨手笨脚地抱住了迪克的头。迪克弓起腰，背部一挺，站了起来，但这时滑水板一歪，他们两个都翻身落水了。

快艇上，罗斯玛丽却在喝彩：“太棒了！只差一点就做成了！”

当快艇转回到落水者跟前时，尼科尔观察了一下迪克的脸色，果然见他一脸恼怒——两年前这套动作对他还是小菜一碟，如今却叫他丢了脸。

在第二次尝试时，他倍加小心，先是微微弓起腰，试一试脖子上的那个年轻人是否坐得稳当，然后又跪了下去。接着，他“嘿哟”喊了一声就开始往上站起，可是没等他站直，两腿就突然打了弯。落水时，他用脚踢开滑水板，以免被滑水板击中。

“宝贝鱼”号快艇这次绕回来时，艇上所有的人都看得出他非常生气。

“要是我再试一次你们不在意吧？”他踩着水说，“刚才我差一点就成功了。”

“没问题。接着干吧。”

尼科尔见他脸色惨白，就像死鱼的那种颜色，便提醒他说：“你不觉得已经够了吗？”

他没吱声。他的搭档倒觉得已经够了，被人拉上了船。那个驾驶快艇的墨西哥人自告奋勇接替了他的位置。

墨西哥人比前一位要重一些。快艇加速时，迪克趴在滑水板上歇了一会儿。随后，他钻到墨西哥人的胯下，拽住绳子，绷紧肌肉，试图站起来。

他试了试，但没能站起来。尼科尔看见他换了个姿势，再次绷紧了身体向上发力，但此刻那位搭档的全身重量都压在了他的肩上，使他动弹不得。他又一次尝试，身子弓起了一英寸，两英寸……尼科尔和他一样紧张，额头上都沁出了汗。他硬撑着，保持着弓身的姿态，后来啪嗒一声双膝又跪了下去。二人都落了水，迪克的头差点被滑水板击中。

“快回去！”尼科尔对驾驶员大叫。甚至就在她大叫的当儿，她看见他沉入了水中，惊得不由喊出了声。不过，他又浮了上来，仰面躺在水上。墨西哥人急忙游过去施救。快艇靠了过去，中途似乎用了很长时间，最终到了他们俩身边时，尼科尔看见迪克精疲力竭地漂浮着，脸上一点表情也没有，在水天之间显得是那么孤独。顿时，她的惊恐变作了轻蔑。

“我们搀着你上来，医生……抓住他的脚……好了……现在上来了……”

迪克坐在那儿喘气，谁也不看。

“我早就知道你不该逞能。”尼科尔禁不住埋怨了一句。

“他前两次把力气都用光了。”墨西哥人说。

“这是做蠢事。”尼科尔又说。罗斯玛丽知趣地一声不吭。

过了一会儿，迪克缓过了神，喘着粗气说：“现在给我个纸娃娃让我举，我也举不起来了。”

众人哈哈大笑，冲淡了一点由他的失败造成的紧张气氛。他下船走上码头时，大家都对他表示了关心。而尼科尔却一肚子气——他现在的一举一动都让她着恼。

迪克到快餐店喝酒去了，她和罗斯玛丽坐到了一把遮阳伞下等他。他不一会儿就回来了，还给她们带了些雪利酒。

“我平生第一次喝酒是跟你们一起喝的。”罗斯玛丽说。突然，她一激动，又接着说道：“啊，见到你们，知道你们一切都好，我心里别提有多高兴了。我还担心……”她欲言又止，把后半句“担心你会出什么事”咽了回去。

“你是听人说起我开始堕落了吧？”

“哦，那倒不是。我只是……只是听说你变了。现在我亲眼看到事实并非如此，这叫我感到高兴。”

“事实就是如此。”迪克在她们身边坐下来时说道，“变化早就开始了，只不过开始的时候不明显罢了——精神垮掉之后，外表有一段时间依然如故。”

“你在里维埃拉开业行医了吗？”罗斯玛丽急忙转换话题问。

“要是找疾病标本，那儿不失为一个好地方。”他一边朝那些在金色沙滩上溜达的人群点头示意，一边说道，“那儿可以选到很棒的标本。咱们的老朋友艾布拉姆斯夫人见到玛丽·诺思，会像公爵夫人见到女王一样，这样的情景你能想象得来吗？你可别眼红哟！你不妨想一想，艾布拉姆斯夫人手脚并用地爬上丽兹饭店那长长的楼梯去迎接她，会吸入多少地毯上的灰尘呀！”

罗斯玛丽打断他的话问：“那不就是玛丽·诺思吗？”她说话时，眼睛望着一个正朝这边走来的女子，那女子身后跟着一小群人，而那群人趾高气扬，好像已经习惯了受人瞻仰一样。那群人来到离他们有十英尺远的地方，玛丽漫不经心地扫了戴弗夫妇一眼——那是目中无人的一扫，明明是看见了他们，却又装作看不见。以前，从来就没有人敢用这样的目光扫视戴弗夫妇，抑或罗斯玛丽·霍伊特。不过，玛丽认出罗斯玛丽后，就改变初衷，走了过来，这使迪克感到有点好笑。她春风满面地跟尼科尔寒暄了几句，绷着脸对迪克点了点头，仿佛他是个传染病人似的，而迪克以点头哈腰的动作挖苦她。随后，她转向罗斯玛丽说：“我听说你到了这儿，要待多久？”

“明天就走。”罗斯玛丽回答。

她也看到了玛丽怎样从戴弗夫妇身边走过来特意跟她说话，心中产生了一种责任感，于是说话显得很冷淡，并且谢绝了玛丽的晚宴邀请。

玛丽转向尼科尔，露出一副关怀中夹杂着怜悯的表情，问道：“孩子们好吗？”

恰在此时，那两个孩子走了过来，向尼科尔诉苦，说家庭女教师不准他们游泳，要尼科尔否决家庭女教师的决定。

“不行！”迪克替尼科尔回答道，“必须照老师说的去做。”

尼科尔也觉得既然授权给老师，就应该维护其权威性，于是就拒绝了孩子们的请求。此时的玛丽，样子有点像安妮塔·卢斯[18]作品里的女主人公（此人只会指手画脚，其实连一只法国狮子狗都摆布不了），她对迪克怒目而视，就好像他犯下了恃强凌弱的弥天大罪似的。迪克见她装模作样的，不禁有点生气，便以假关心实讥讽的语气问道：“你家的孩子好吗？……他们的姑妈好吗？”

玛丽没有回答，转身走掉了。离开之前，她还伸出手同情地摸了摸拉尼尔的头，而拉尼尔却显得很不情愿。她走后，迪克说道：“想一想，我还给她看过病呢。”

“我喜欢她。”尼科尔说。

迪克的刻薄让罗斯玛丽感到意外，她一直认为他是个宽厚大度、善解人意的人呢。倏然，她回想起了自己听到的一些有关于他的闲言碎语。有一次在轮船上，她碰见了几个美国国务院的官员——那是一些欧洲化了的美国人，欧化的程度非常深，几乎都说不准他们究竟是哪个国家的人了，最起码不像是强权国家的人，倒有点像哪个巴尔干国家的人（凡是巴尔干国家里的公民差不多都一个样）。交谈中，那几个官员提到了几乎无人不知的芭比·沃伦，说她的妹妹不幸嫁给了一个生活放荡的医生。其中的一位女官员说：“他现在不管到何处，都是不受欢迎的人。”

这话使罗斯玛丽深感不安，虽然她难以把戴弗夫妇同这样的社交圈子联系在一起，觉得即便迪克的确放荡，也不至于严重到那种地步，可是那句满怀敌意、别有用心的评价言犹在耳：“他现在不管到何处，都是不受欢迎的人。”于是，她想象着迪克登上一座府邸的台阶，递上名片，却被管家告知：“我们这儿不再欢迎你了！”随后，他顺着大街继续往前走，无论是拜访大使、部长还是临时代办，都会吃闭门羹，听到管家们说同样的话……

尼科尔在寻思脱身之计，她觉得迪克一受到刺激就会兴奋起来，继而施展自己的魅力，对罗斯玛丽产生影响。果不其然，片刻之后他便开始修正他刚才说过的辛辣的话。只听他说道：“玛丽还是挺不错的，做事非常得体。只不过，要是别人不喜欢你，你就很难始终对他们保持好感。”

罗斯玛丽对此颇有同感，朝迪克倾过身去，莺声燕语地说道：“你是个大好人。不管你说什么话、做什么事，我简直想象不来有谁会记恨你。”话一出口，她又觉得自己的满腔热情或许侵犯了尼科尔的权利，于是便低头看着他们俩正中间的沙地，说道：“我最近拍的几部片子不知你们看过没有？我想听听你们的看法。”

尼科尔没吭声——她倒是看过其中的一部，但没往心上放。

“这是三言两语说不清的。”迪克说，“咱们不妨设想一下，如果在生活中，尼科尔对你说拉尼尔病了，那你会怎么样？一般人遇到这种情况会怎么样？谁都会做出反应的，通过面部表情、声音和话语做出反应——面部显示出悲哀，声音透露出惊愕，话语表达的则是同情。”

“是的……我明白了。”

“但演戏就不一样了。优秀的演员积攒人气靠的是用夸张的手法表达感情，表达恐惧、爱和同情。”

“我明白了。”（罗斯玛丽口中说明白，其实并不太明白）

尼科尔听得一头雾水，越来越不耐烦了，然而迪克自顾自地说了下去：

“一个女演员所面临的挑战是现场反应。咱们不妨再做一番设想吧。假如在生活中有人告诉你，说你的心上人死了，你可能会悲恸欲绝；但演戏时，你的职责是给观众带来娱乐，由观众自己去‘反应’。首先，演员必须背台词，然后需要将观众的注意力从中国人被谋杀的场景，或别的什么场景，转移到她身上来。所以，她必须随机应变——观众觉得她冷酷，那她就温柔一些；观众认为她太温柔，那她就冷酷一些。必须超越角色，明白吗？”

“不怎么明白，”罗斯玛丽承认道，“你所说的‘超越角色’是什么意思？”

“就是随机应变，让观众抛开客观事实而将注意力集中到你身上。那时，你再重新进入角色。”

尼科尔再也受不了了，猛地站了起来，丝毫不想掩饰她不耐烦的心情。罗斯玛丽过了一会儿才有所醒悟，为了缓和气氛，便转向托普西说：“你长大后想当演员吗？我想你一定能成为一个出色的女演员。”

尼科尔狠狠地瞪了罗斯玛丽一眼，用她祖父的那种腔调，缓慢而清晰地说道：“给别人家的孩子头脑里灌输这样的思想，实在不应该。记住，我们可能对他们有截然不同的安排。”说着，她霍地把脸转向了迪克：“我现在开车回家，然后叫米歇尔来接你和孩子。”

“你有几个月没开车了。”迪克不同意地说。

“我还不至于忘了怎么开吧。”

尼科尔离开遮阳伞走掉了，看也没看脸上正在起激烈“反应”的罗斯玛丽。

在更衣室里，她换了衣服，一张脸仍无任何表情，就像一块铁板。但是到了一条松树林荫道，她的心情便随着环境发生了变化——这儿有小松鼠在树枝上跳跃，风儿轻拂着树叶，雄鸡的鸣叫划破了长空，阳光悄悄地穿行于宁静的景物之间，而海滩上的嘈杂声越来越远。她全身心放松，感到欢快，神清气爽，大脑像被水洗过一样清晰，有一种大病初愈后获得新生的感觉。沿着那条她已经走了多年的弯弯曲曲的公路返回家中，她的一颗心像鲜艳的玫瑰一样开始绽放。她讨厌海滩，讨厌当配角，不愿像行星围绕着太阳那样围着迪克打转转。

“嗬，我差不多已经彻底痊愈了，”她暗想，“实际上不需要依靠别人了，没有他也能生活。”她就像个快活的孩子，渴望着早日独立，心里依稀觉得这也是迪克的安排。一回到家，她就趴在床上，给在尼斯的汤米·巴尔班写了一封颇具挑逗性的短信。

但这是白天的情形——傍晚时分，随着精力的必然衰退，她的情绪也低落了下去，在一片暮色里感到眼花意乱。她有点害怕，怕的是迪克别有心思。根据他近来的表现，她觉得他在打自己的小算盘，这叫她心生忧虑。迪克的小算盘天衣无缝，似乎面面俱到，让她怎么也吃不透。她已习惯于让迪克代她思考问题，即便迪克不在跟前，似乎也会不由自主地按他的喜好办事，所以现在她反其道而行之，就觉得很不适应了。然而，她必须独立思考。她终于找到了那扇通向幻想世界的可畏的大门，知道了大门上的门牌号码，找到了逃亡的路径（尽管她仍然无法逃脱）。她知道，无论是现在还是将来，她最大的过错莫过于自我欺骗。这是一个惨重的教训，但她现在已经学乖了。你自己必须学会思考——别人代替你思考，就会剥夺你的力量，扭曲和限制你自己的品位，对你进行驯化，最终把你变成一个废物！

他们平静地吃了晚餐，迪克喝了许多啤酒，在昏暗的房间里同孩子们玩得很快活。后来，他弹了几首舒伯特[19]的曲子和一些新的美国爵士乐曲。尼科尔伏在他肩头用有力、悦耳的女低音轻轻哼唱道：

感谢爸爸

感谢妈妈

感谢你们相逢于路上……

“我不喜欢这支歌。”迪克说着就开始翻乐谱。

“哦，就弹这支曲子！”尼科尔叫道，“难道你让我在以后的日子里一遇到‘爸爸’这个词就躲开吗？”

感谢那天夜里拉车的马儿，

感谢你们俩沉迷于醉乡……

弹唱完，他们就跟孩子一道爬上摩尔式[20]房顶，坐在那儿观赏远处海岸边两家游乐场放的焰火。他们两人在一处，心却是孤独的、空虚的和凄凉的。

次日上午，尼科尔从戛纳采购回来，见到了一张迪克留的便条，说他开那辆小型汽车到普罗旺斯去了，在那儿一个人待上几天。就在她读便条时，电话铃响了——那是汤米·巴尔班从蒙特卡洛打来的，说他已收到她的来信，正要开车过来。她衷心地欢迎他的到来，觉得自己贴在话筒上的嘴唇暖丝丝的。





第八章


她洗过澡，脸上涂了护肤霜，身上抹了爽身粉，同时，双脚踩在浴巾上，脚趾在旁边的一叠浴巾上蹭了蹭。她细细地打量着身体两侧的曲线，心中暗想：真不知再过多久，这漂亮的线条就会消失，苗条的腰肢会变成水桶腰。大概再过五六年吧……不过，她现在还不甘心，实际上，她愿意跟任何一个她认识的女子一争高下。

尼科尔这可不是吹牛。现在的她跟五年前的她没什么差别，唯一的不同是她已不再是个妙龄女子了。不过，目前社会上崇拜青春的潮流还是挺影响她的情绪的——电影里的那些小孩脸女演员唯我独尊，就好像她们代表着人类的成就和智慧似的，这叫她对青春产生了妒意。

她穿上一袭曳地长裙（这件裙子购于多年前，是她第一件这样长度的长裙），然后虔诚地在身上交叉洒了些香奈儿十六号香水[21]。汤米下午一点驾车来到时，她已经打扮得袅袅婷婷，鲜花一样美艳。

这种感觉真美——再一次受到崇拜，再一次披上神秘的面纱！回想起自己如花似玉的年华，她由于高傲痛失了两年宝贵的时间，此时她遗情缱绻，觉得应该弥补逝去的时光。她欢迎汤米，仿佛他是当年拜倒在她脚下的众多男子中的一个。但见她昂首走在他前面，而非跟他并排走，他们一起穿过花园，朝一把遮阳伞走去。二十九岁的女子只要自信，跟十九岁的少女一样妩媚动人。而且，二十多岁女子的内心比较苛求，不再对外部世界感兴趣。相比之下，十九岁少女就像是傲慢的军校小女生，而二十九岁的女子则可比作从情场上凯旋的昂首阔步的战士。

十九岁少女的自信来自于别人关注的目光，而二十九岁女子的自信是靠比较含蓄的养分滋润的。此时的尼科尔虽然也充满了欲望，但没有乱分寸，而是理智地选择着开胃酒，或者说满足于品尝余味无穷的鱼子酱。幸运的是，无论在哪种情况下，她似乎对未来都没有多加考虑——患得患失只会搅乱她的心绪。再怎么说，十九岁也罢，二十九岁也罢，都没有什么可惧怕的。

尼科尔并不想陷入那种朦胧的、浪漫的精神恋爱，只想“风流一把”，换换口味。她情知：按迪克的观点，从浅处说这是一种下流的恋情，缺乏感情基础，是放荡的行为，害人又害己。从另一方面看，她将眼下这种状况归咎于迪克，而且真心认为这样的试验也许会有治病的效果。整个夏天，她亲眼看见有些人放纵情欲，却没有受到惩罚，于是自己也跃跃欲试。再说，她不愿再欺骗自己了，觉得这只不过是在尝试一种新的生活，随时都可以退回来嘛……

在一处阴凉的地方，汤米伸出白皙的胳膊一把将她抱住，让她把脸转过来，看着她的眼睛说：“别动，让我好好瞧瞧你。”

他的头发散发出香味，白色的衣服上有股淡淡的肥皂气味。她抿着双唇，脸上不露笑容。一时间，他们只是相互对视着。

“你看了喜欢吗？”她喃喃地问。

“说法语吧。”

“好的，”她又用法语问了一声，“你看了喜欢吗？”

他将她搂得更紧了。

“你的一切，我看了都喜欢。”他有些迟疑地说，“我原以为我是熟悉你的面孔的，但现在你的脸上好像多了一种我不了解的东西。你什么时候开始有了这种浅色的骗子般的眼睛？”

她挣脱开来，又惊又气，用英语嚷嚷道：“你要讲法语，难道就是要说这些？”见管家端着雪利酒走来，她这才把声调放低了，说道：“你这样说话是不是有意气人？”

她一屁股坐到了铺着银白色布垫的椅子上。

“我手边没有镜子，”她又用法语说道，但语气很坚定，“若说我的眼睛有了变化，那是因为我恢复了健康。恢复健康也许意味着恢复了真实的自我——我猜我的爷爷就是一个骗子，这是我继承来的，我们爷孙俩一个样。这样说是否合乎你的逻辑？”

他懵懵懂懂的，好像不知道她在说什么。

“迪克上哪儿去了？他跟咱们一起吃午饭吗？”

她看出他刚才的话其实并无恶意，于是哈哈一笑作为了结，然后说道：“迪克去旅行了。罗斯玛丽·霍伊特来了——要么他俩正在一起耳鬓厮磨，要么就是罗斯玛丽惹恼了他，气得他一走了之，心里却仍对她念念不忘。”

“知道吗？你也有点想得太多了。”

“绝对不是的！”她急忙申辩道，“实际上，我可不是……我只是……我只是一个脑子简单的人。”

仆人马里厄斯送来了西瓜和一桶冰水。尼科尔还在想汤米说她骗子般的眼睛的那句话，遂没有回应，她觉得眼前的这个男人不好对付，可不是让你由着性子任意摆布的

“你为什么不自然一些，保持自己的天性呢？”汤米突然开口说道，“你是我所认识的人中最引人注目的。”

她没作声。

“这可是女人的看家本事哟！”他嘲笑地说。

“每个社会都有一些这样的人……”她依稀觉得迪克在近旁监督着她，但她还是耐心听汤米说了下去，“对男人嘛，我有时会粗暴一些，但是对有些女人就不敢贸然行事了。尤其是在‘温柔乡里’，更不敢鲁莽。强扭的瓜不甜，对谁都没有好处。难道对你有好处吗？对他有好处吗？”

她的心突突乱跳，但一想到夫妻恩情，情绪就又稳定了下来。

“我觉得我有……”

“你有太多的钱！”他不耐烦地接口说，“这就是问题的症结！这就是迪克无力摆脱的魔咒！”

她默默思索着，仆人走过来把西瓜端走了。

“你说我该怎么办？”

被一个男人牵着鼻子走，而这个男人却不是她的丈夫，十年中这对她而言还是第一遭儿。汤米说的每一句话都融入了她心里，永远地留在了那儿。

他们喝着葡萄酒。微风吹拂着松树的松针，午后的骄阳在格子图案的桌布上投下了斑驳的耀眼的光点。汤米走到她身后，伸开双臂搂住她，紧紧握住她的手，先是用面颊蹭了蹭她的脸，接着便将热吻印在了她的芳唇上。她娇喘吁吁，一半是因为动了真情，一半则是因为惊讶，没想到事情竟然来得如此突然……

“下午能不能把家庭教师和孩子们支走？”

“他们要上钢琴课。再说，我不想待在这儿。”

“再吻吻我。”

少顷，他们驾车前往尼斯。她心想：这么说我有双浅色的骗子般的眼睛喽？那也不错，一个有理性的骗子，也比疯狂的清教徒好。

汤米的一席话似乎叫她吃了定心丸，使她不再害怕内疚或担责，而是满怀喜悦地开始用新的眼光看待自己。一片新的天地就在眼前，那儿出现了许多男子的面孔，没有一个需要她服从，甚至也不必去爱他们。她深深吸了一口气，晃了晃肩膀，转过身对汤米说：“是不是到蒙特卡洛，去你下榻的旅馆？”

汤米猛地踩住了刹车，汽车轮子发出了刺耳的摩擦声。

“不！”他回答说，“上帝啊，我幸福极啦，从来没有像现在这样快活过！”

他们沿着蓝色的海岸穿过尼斯，朝地势稍高的滨海路驶去，然后下陡坡到了海边，经过一个平坦的半岛，将车停在了海边一家小旅馆的后院。

事情真的就要发生了！这叫尼科尔一时感到惶恐不安。在服务台，一个美国人在跟服务员就钞票兑换利率的事情争论个没完。她来回溜达，外表平静，而内心却乱糟糟的。汤米在填写住宿登记表——他用的是真名，给她填的则是假名。他们的房间面向地中海，房间里陈设简单，但较为整洁，虽然外边的海面亮光闪闪，这儿却比较幽暗。朴素的地方，享受朴素的欢乐！汤米要了两杯法国白兰地。服务员送来酒，随手拉上了门后，他在唯一的一把椅子上坐了下来。但见他脸膛黝黑，有些疤痕，显得英俊潇洒，眉毛呈弧形，向上弓起，犹如一位好斗的精灵，一个破釜沉舟的魔鬼。

酒还没喝完，他们便不约而同地突然走到一起，站在那儿拥抱，随后坐在了床上。他吻她矫健的膝盖，她稍微挣扎了几下，犹如一只被砍了头的动物，接着便忘了迪克，忘了所谓的“浅色的眼睛”，甚至也忘了汤米本人，渐渐地陷下去，沉醉于当前的每一分每一秒。

后来，汤米听见下面有响动，声音越来越大，于是他起身推开一扇窗户，想看看究竟是怎么回事。他的肤色比迪克黑，体格比迪克强壮，在窗口亮光下，身上那隆起的条子肌肉清晰可见。此时，他也把她忘了……两人的肉体几乎刚一分开，她就有一种预感：事情的发展会超出她的想象。她感到莫名的恐惧——这种恐惧感压倒了其他的感觉，压倒了喜悦或悲哀，仿佛听见了预示着暴风雨即将来临的隆隆雷声。

汤米走到露台上，小心翼翼地向下张望，说道：“从这儿可以看见下面的那个露台上有两个女子在闲聊天气，她们坐在美式摇椅上晃晃悠悠的。”

“那响动是她们弄出来的吗？”

“是她们楼下的什么地方传过来的。你听！”

在遥远的南方，

那儿是棉花之乡，

旅馆条件差，

生意也不怎么样，

还是到别的地方闯荡……

“是几个美国人在唱歌。”

尼科尔摊开四肢躺在床上，眼睛盯着天花板，爽身粉湿淋淋地粘在身上，就好像身上抹了一层牛奶。她喜欢这个空空荡荡的房间，也喜欢一只小苍蝇在头顶上飞来飞去发出的嗡嗡声。汤米把椅子拖到床边，将椅子上的衣服推到地上，坐了下来。她喜欢那套价钱便宜、薄如蝉翼的长裙，也喜欢地板上同他的衣服堆在一起的那双便鞋。

他看了看她那雪白的条状躯体，再看看和躯体相连的晒红了的四肢和脑袋，然后爽朗地笑了几声，说道：“你就像是个刚出生的婴儿。”

“一个有着浅色眼睛的婴儿。”

“那我可要小心点。”

“这可是防不胜防哟！尤其是芝加哥女子的眼神更叫你吃不消。”

“我可是有朗格多克[22]民间的防身秘籍呢。”

“再吻吻我，汤米，吻我的嘴唇。”

“好一种美国做派！”他说了一声，但还是吻了她，“我上次到美国去，碰见了几个女孩子，她们跟你接吻，就好像恨不得要把你一口吞下肚一样，累得她们脸发红，嘴角上都起了血印子……后来也就不了了之了。”

尼科尔用一个胳膊肘撑起身子说：“我喜欢这个房间。”

“我觉得这房间过于简陋。亲爱的。我很高兴你不愿再等待，不愿等着到达蒙特卡洛再说。”

“怎么说简陋呢？这个房间很不错呀，汤米，就跟塞尚[23]们和毕加索们所画的桌子一样朴素大方。”

“这我不太懂。”其实，他也不想懂，“怎么又有喧闹声？天呀，该不是出命案了吧？”

他走到窗口，又一次把看到的情况讲给尼科尔听：“好像是两个美国水手在打架，许多人围观起哄。他们是从停在海岸边的你们国家的军舰上下来的。”他用浴巾裹住身体，走到了露台上，“他们身边还有妓女呢。听说不管军舰开到哪里，这些卖春妇就跟到哪里。可是，那几个妓女未免太难看了！单凭他们拿那么高的军饷，怎么也能找到好的！何必要找只配跟科尔尼诺夫[24]鬼混的廉价妓女！就好像只配看芭蕾舞，看不起大戏似的！”

尼科尔很高兴他跟那么多的女子有过交往，觉得这么一来他也就不稀罕女人了，而她便可以施展超越肉体的个人魅力将他牢牢地拴住。

“打他的要害处！”

“打呀！打呀！”

“喂，我让你打的是他的右侧！”

“加油，杜尔斯米特，你这小子！”

“打呀！打呀！”

“打呀！打呀！打呀！”

汤米离开了窗口说：“这地方好像不能再待了，是不是？”

她表示同意。可是，他们还没穿衣服就又如胶似漆地抱在了一起，久久不愿离开，仿佛这儿是一座宫殿一样让人不舍……

最后，汤米开始穿衣服，看了一眼窗外说：“老天，楼下露台上坐在摇椅上的那两个女人还没动弹，她们聊起来简直没完没了。她们在这儿度假可真能省钱，全然不受美国大兵和欧洲妓女一丝一毫的干扰。”

他温情脉脉地走过来，搂住她，用牙齿咬住她的衬裙裙带，将裙带搭在她的肩上。就在这时，一阵呜呜呜的汽笛声划破了长空——那是军舰在召唤水兵们回去！

顿时，窗下人语喧哗，乱成了一团——前来接水兵们的小艇不声不响朝岸边开了过来。服务员高声喊叫，要水兵们赶快结账——水兵们有的骂娘，有的赖账，有的掏出的钞票面值太大，找的零钱面值却又太小。有几个水兵喝得烂醉如泥，得由别人扶着上船。在一片喧嚷声中，可以听见海军宪兵严厉的呵斥声。第一艘汽艇离岸时，喊声、哭声、尖叫声和山盟海誓声响成了一片。女人们你拥我挤奔上码头，高声喊着，挥舞着手臂。

汤米看见一个女孩冲到楼下的露台上，挥舞着一块餐巾。还没等他看清那两个坐在摇椅上的英国女人是否最终停止了闲聊，是否同意那女孩到她们的露台上来，就听见他们的房间有人在敲门。门外有女子激动的叫喊声，请他们把门打开。汤米打开门，看见走廊里站着两个女孩，是两个瘦瘦的小姑娘，身上有一股粗俗气，不像是找错了房间，倒像是有意找到这儿来的。其中的一个抽抽搭搭地哭着。

“我们能在你们的露台上跟人打个招呼吗？”另一个带着美国口音，情绪激动地恳求道，“行吗？就跟男朋友招个手？请行个方便吧。别的房间门都锁着呢。”

“请吧。”汤米说。

两个女孩一阵风似的冲到露台上，接着便听见了她们尖厉的叫喊声（那声音盖过了外边的嘈杂声）：“喂，查利！查利！往上看！”

“打电报到尼斯，让他们把电报转送过来！”

“查利！他没看到我。”

一个女孩突然撩起裙子，把她粉红色的内裤猛地拽下来，撕成一面大大的旗子，一边尖声叫喊着“本！本！”，一边拼命挥舞着。汤米和尼科尔离开房间时，那面旗子仍在蓝天下飘扬着。啊，看见旗子那粉红的颜色，很容易让你想起皮肉的柔和的颜色！军舰后甲板上升起的一面星条旗，正与之交相辉映！

他们在蒙特卡洛的一家新开张的海滩娱乐场吃了饭……后来，他们到博略[25]去游泳。月光下，游泳场像是一座露天洞穴，水面似磷光般发亮，四周围着一圈白色的巨石。这儿面向摩纳哥[26]和若隐若现的芒通[27]。她很高兴他把她带到这儿来欣赏东部景色——这儿的海风和海水令她感到耳目一新。就跟他们俩之间的关系一样，这儿的一切都是新鲜的。具有象征意味的是，她稳稳当当骑在他的脊背上，就像坐在马鞍上——仿佛他把她从大马士革[28]解救了出来，二人一道来到了蒙古平原上。迪克的教诲在一点点远离她——她在逐渐恢复她原始的天性，耳闻情场上的厮杀声，于朦胧之中接受了向她射来的爱情之箭。月光下，她情意绵绵，敞开胸怀欢迎着她的情人。

他们一觉醒来，发现月亮已经落下，空气中有了寒气。她翻身坐起，问几点钟了，汤米回答说大概是凌晨三点。

“我该回去了。”

“我以为咱们要在蒙特卡洛过夜呢。”

“不了。家里还有家庭教师和孩子呢。天亮前我得赶回去。”

“那就随你了。”

他们又在水里泡了一会儿。他见她瑟瑟发抖，便赶紧用毛巾给她擦了身子。坐到汽车上，他们的头发湿湿的，皮肤光光的，还发着亮。他们真不愿就这么登程返回。他们所处的位置灯光很亮，而汤米开始在灯光下吻她。她隐隐觉得他特别喜欢她白净的脸、雪白的牙齿、凉丝丝的额头以及她那只抚摸他脸庞的手。她仍然有点受迪克风格的影响，以为会听到几句温情的话语或称赞，但什么也没有听到。后来，她心满意足地打起了瞌睡，虽然没有听到温情的话，但内心感到很幸福。她坐在汽车后座上蒙眬睡去，直到引擎变了声音才醒来，感到汽车在爬坡朝黛安娜别墅驶去。到了别墅门口，她几乎是无意识地与他吻别。走在小径上，她觉得自己的脚步声都变了，花园里夜间的窸窣声也变得跟从前不一样了。但不管怎么样，回到家里，她的心情还是蛮高兴的。这一天就像演电影一样一闪而过——她虽然心满意足，但还是不太习惯这种紧张的节奏。





第九章


次日下午四点，一辆出租车从火车站开来停在了别墅门口，迪克下了车。尼科尔顿时惊慌起来，忙不迭从露台上跑去迎接，由于竭力要掩饰内心的情绪，竟有点气喘吁吁。

“咱们家的车呢？”她问。

“我把它留在了阿尔勒[29]。我不想再开车了。”

“看你的便条，我以为你要过几天才回来呢。”

“途中遇到了些风雨，只好打道回府了。”

“玩得高兴吗？”

“还不就是为了逃离繁杂的事务，换换环境呗。我开车带罗斯玛丽去了阿维尼翁[30]，在那儿把她送上了火车。”夫妻二人走到了露台上，迪克放下了手中的旅行包，“我在便条上没提这些，怕你会多心。”

“难为你这么体贴人。”尼科尔此时反倒觉得底气更足了。

“当时我是想听听她有什么心里话要说，只好去见她一面了。”

“她对你说心里话了吗？”

“罗斯玛丽还是个没长大的孩子。”他回话说，“也许这样更好。这段时间你都干什么了？”

她觉得自己脸上的肌肉一抽一抽的，就像兔子的脸。

“我昨晚去跳舞了……是和汤米·巴尔班去的。我们去了……”

迪克皱了皱眉头，打断了她的话说：“不必告诉我这些。你干了什么无关紧要，我不想了解得那么细。”

“其实也没有别的什么。”

“好吧，好吧。”随后，他像是出门许久方才归来一样，问道：“孩子们怎么样？”

屋内的电话铃此时响了起来。

“如果是找我的，就说我不在家，”迪克说完一转身走开了，“我要去工作室做点事。”

尼科尔一直等他的身影消失在水井后边，才进屋拿起了话筒。

“尼科尔，你好吗？”

“迪克回家了。”

汤米哼了一声。

“你来戛纳找我吧，”他建议道，“我有话要跟你说。”

“我去不成。”

“对我说你爱我。”

她没吱声，只是对着话筒点了点头。

他又重复道：“对我说你爱我。”

“哦，我爱你，”她以肯定的语气说，“但眼下什么事也做不成。”

“当然能做，”他不耐烦地说，“迪克明白你们俩的关系已经完了，并且打了退堂鼓，这是明摆着的。他还想让你怎么样？”

“我不知道。我得……”她原想说“我得问过迪克以后再说”，但说出口的却是“明天我给你写信、打电话”。

她为自己取得的成就颇为得意，满意地在屋里踱来踱去。她现在成了红颜祸水，这叫她感到自豪——她不再是一个被圈在栏里任人摆布的女子了。昨天的情节一幕幕如在眼前——那些情节如潮水般涌来，淹没了她对迪克忠贞不渝时二人耳鬓厮磨的情节。现在，她开始蔑视自己对迪克的那种忠贞的爱，觉得那种爱一开始就带有她一贯具有的多愁善感的色彩。女人的回忆随机性很大——她和迪克结婚前的那个月，二人不惜跑到天涯海角去，在秘密的地方你侬我侬，当时的那种感受她现在几乎都记不起来了。她昨夜还对汤米撒了谎呢，信誓旦旦地说自己以前从未如此完全彻底、毫无保留地坠入过爱河……

后来，她为自己的背叛感到惭愧，觉得不该将十年的婚姻看得一文不值，想到这里便转身向迪克的工作室走去。

悄无声息地走到跟前，她发现他在房屋后面，正坐在崖壁前的一把折叠帆布躺椅上，于是停住脚步静静观察了一会儿。他在想心事，沉浸在完全属于他自己的世界里，脸上的表情在不时变化，眉毛扬起又落下，眼睛瞪大又眯起，嘴唇张开又抿上，两只手也在动来动去的。看得出他在回味自己经历的一桩桩事情（那是他的事情，跟她无关）。他一度握紧拳头，身体前倾，脸上流露出痛苦和绝望的表情——这种表情从脸上消失后，仍在他的眼睛里滞留不去。她几乎是有生以来第一次为他感到难过了——一个曾经身患精神疾病的人竟会为一个健康的人感到难过，这叫人很难想象！尼科尔经常说是他令她重获新生，使她回到了现实世界，她将他视为一个精力充沛、永不知疲倦的人……她一时全然忘了正是她自己给他带来了痛苦，忘了是怎样的心理才促使她红杏出墙，只觉得他再也不能控制她了。这一点他知道吗？这是不是他希望看到的？她为他感到难过，正如她有时为阿贝·诺思及其可悲的命运感到难过一样，为那些无助的孤儿和老人感到难过一样。

她走上前，用胳膊搂住他的肩膀，拿脸蹭着他的脸说：“别难过了。”

他冷冰冰地瞧瞧她，然后说道：“别碰我！”

她慌乱地后退了几步。

“请原谅，”他心不在焉地说，“我正在想应该怎么看待你呢……”

“何不把我作为新的病例加进你的专著里？”

“我也想到了这一点——‘精神失常和神经病症的后遗症’。”

“我不是来这儿找不愉快的。”

“那你为什么要来呢，尼科尔？我不能再给你任何帮助了，挽救我自己都来不及呢。”

“挽救你不受我传染？”

“出于职业需要，我有时得同有问题的人打交道。”

尼科尔受不了这一侮辱，气得哭了起来。

“你是个懦夫！你自己人生不得意，却拿我出气！”

他没吭声。但她又一次开始感受到了他的智慧所产生的影响——这种智慧有时并不具备强大的力量，然而其中却包含着真实的东西，让她无法否认，甚至无法面对。她又生反抗之心，用她的蛾眉细眼，用上流社会的高傲，用她刚刚萌生的移情别恋，用多年的积怨，和他一拼到底——她的金钱和信念（她坚信姐姐芭比讨厌迪克）是她的后盾。他语言刻薄，结果四面树敌；他由于酗酒变得反应迟钝，而她思维敏捷；他的身体一天不如一天，而她健康、美丽；他固守自己的道德理念，而她无所顾忌——这些都是她的有力武器。在这场内心世界的大搏斗中，她无所畏惧，勇敢搏击，甚至拿她的缺点，拿破盆子烂瓦罐当武器，其中不乏已经受到过惩罚的罪孽、劣迹和错误。在短短两分钟的时间里，她旗开得胜，无须撒谎，无须掩饰，义正词严地证实了自己的力量，永远割断了和他的联系，然后拖着两条无力的腿，低声啜泣着朝着大房子走去——那儿终于属于她一人了。

迪克等她的身影消失后，头一低，伏在了矮墙上。这个病案结束了，戴弗医生自由啦！





第十章


那天夜里两点钟，电话铃声把尼科尔吵醒了，她听见迪克在隔壁房间里那张他们称为“失眠之床”的床上接了电话。

“喂，喂……你是哪位？喂……”他惊讶地提高了嗓门，睡意全消，“警官先生，我能跟两位女士中的某一位说话吗？她们可都是有头有脸的人，都是有背景的，弄不好会在政界引发极其严重的风波……这是真的，我对你发誓……好吧，你会明白的。”

他翻身起床，细细想了想，觉得自己必须出面解决此事——旧日的那种为朋友两肋插刀的豪情，那种气冲霄汉的英雄气，一起在他的心中大叫：“让我来！”这件事与他毫不相干，但他必须出面，因为赢得别人的爱戴已经成了他的一种习惯。也许，当他意识到自己是一个没落家族唯一的一线希望时，就开始养成了这种习惯。以前在苏黎世湖的多姆勒诊所也出现过几乎是相同的情况，那时他已经意识到了这种习惯的力量，在必须做出人生选择时，毅然选择了奥菲利娅[31]，选择了一杯酣蜜的毒酒，一饮而尽。首先，他渴望表现出英雄的豪情和慈悲的心肠，甚至比这更重要的是渴望赢得别人的爱戴。过去他侠肝义胆，将来也永远会义胆侠肝！当挂上电话，那叮当的一声余音尚在时，他意识到这是一种改不了的习惯。

过了好长一会儿，尼科尔喊道：“什么事呀？谁来的电话？”

迪克刚一放下话筒就开始穿衣服了，他回答道：“是昂蒂布[32]警察局打来的电话——他们拘留了玛丽·诺思和那个西布利——比尔斯夫人。事情很严重……那位警官不肯说究竟是什么事，只说不是命案，也不是车祸，说话藏头露尾，让人觉得她们肯定捅了大娄子。”

“他们为什么要给你打电话呢？听上去让人觉得太怪了。”

“她们想获得保释以保住面子，而只有在滨海阿尔卑斯省拥有财产的人才能提供担保。”

“她们的脸皮真厚。”

“现在顾不上这些了。我到旅馆，把高斯叫上一起去……”

迪克走后，尼科尔醒着躺在床上，心里直犯嘀咕，不知那两人犯了什么罪，后来想着想着就又睡着了。凌晨三点过后不久，迪克走了进来。她从梦中醒来，坐起身子问事情处理得怎么样，那口气就像是在对梦境里的人说话。

“这是一件令人称奇的事情……”迪克在她的床脚坐下来，开始讲述自己的经历。他说他把高斯老头从阿尔萨斯人的梦乡里叫醒，让他把现金柜里的钱全拿上，然后开车和他一起去了警察局。

“我可不愿帮那个英国人的忙。”高斯嘟嘟哝哝地说。

玛丽·诺思和卡罗琳女士穿着水手装，斜倚在两间昏暗囚室外的一把长椅上。后者气咻咻的，摆出不列颠人的那种盛气凌人的架势，就好像英国的地中海舰队马上就会来营救她一样。玛丽·明盖蒂却神情惶恐，一副快要崩溃的样子。一见迪克，便扑进了他的怀里，仿佛只有那儿才可以得到安慰，乞求迪克赶快想想办法。与此同时，警察局长在向高斯说明情况，高斯虽然不情愿，但还是在耐着性子听他说的每一句话——一方面，他真心欣赏局长的口才，另一方面，则装出一副细心聆听的样子，对于局长讲述的事情却缺乏热情。

“简直就是笑话。”卡罗琳夫人轻蔑地说，“我们只不过假扮成休假的水手，搭上了两个傻乎乎的女孩，带她们去开了个房间，谁知她们却咋咋呼呼，闹了起来。”

迪克严肃地点点头，眼睛盯着石头地面，就像一个神父在听别人忏悔。他心里觉得可笑，直想笑出声来，同时又觉得可气，恨不得将她俩抽上五十鞭子，饿上她们两个星期，只提供给她们一点面包和白开水。叫他感到困惑的是，卡罗琳夫人的脸上竟无耻辱感，只有一种无辜感，就好像是那两个胆小如鼠的普罗旺斯女孩及愚蠢的警察使她蒙受了耻辱。不过，他老早就有一种想法，认为某些阶层的英国人具有强烈的反社会情绪——相形之下，纽约的暴力案件就是小打小闹了，就像是冰淇淋吃多了患上了消化不良症一样。

“我必须出去，可别让侯赛因知道了这事。”玛丽恳求道，“迪克，你有能力把事情摆平——你总是能将大事化小，小事化了的。你告诉他们，我们要马上回家。告诉他们，多少钱我们都付。”

“我才不付呢，”卡罗琳女士鄙夷地说，“一分钱也不付！我倒很想知道戛纳的英国领事会怎么说。”

“不！不！”玛丽执意说，“今天夜里咱们必须出去。”

“我想想办法，看我能做些什么吧。”迪克话刚出口，又补充了一句，“钱还是要花的。”他见她们一脸明明自己有过错却又装无辜的表情，便摇摇头说：“想不到竟有这样荒诞离奇的事情！”

卡罗琳夫人却露出得意的表情，笑笑说：“你不是精神病医生么，怎么想不到呢？你应该是能够帮助我们的，而高斯也是责无旁贷！”

听到这话，迪克走到高斯身边，向老头询问他所了解到的情况。事情比他们原先知道的要严重——她们搭上的其中一个女孩是体面人家的孩子。那家人怒不可遏（或者说假装怒不可遏），不花钱是无法平息他们的怒火的。另一个女孩是码头上的拉客女，倒是比较容易应付。依据法国的法律，一旦定罪，就要被判入狱，或至少被公开驱逐出国。雪上加霜的是，当地居民对外国人正在失去耐心，分歧很大——有的因为外国人而受益，有的人则因物价的不断上涨而迁怒外国人。高斯把整个情况对迪克概述了一番后，迪克叫来警察局长商量解决的办法。

“你知道法国政府十分想吸引美国游客。今年夏天巴黎颁布了一条法令：美国人除非犯下了严重罪行，否则不准拘捕。”

“这种罪行还不够严重吗，我的上帝！”

“话是这么说……你们是不是扣下了她们的身份证？”

“她们没有身份证，什么也没有，只有两百法郎和几枚戒指。她们甚至连上吊用的鞋带也没有！”

一听说她们没有身份证，迪克倒松了口气，于是侃侃说道：“这位意大利伯爵夫人仍然保留着美国国籍，她是约翰·戴维森·洛克菲勒·梅隆[33]的孙女。”他不慌不忙，编出了一串谎言，“你听说过她的祖父吧？”

“当然听说过。天呀，你是不是把我当成乡巴佬了？”

“另外，她还是亨利·福特[34]的外甥女，跟雷诺及雪铁龙公司[35]都是有关系的……”他觉得最好就说到这儿，然而见他郑重的语气对局长产生了影响，便又说了下去，“逮捕她就跟逮捕一位显要的英国皇室人员一样后果严重，很可能意味着战争！”

“至于这位英国女士怎么说？”

“我正要说她呢。她同威尔士亲王的弟弟，也就是白金汉公爵订了婚。”

“她会成为一个好新娘的。”

“这样吧。我们准备给……”迪克飞快地在心里计算了一下，“给那两个女孩每人一千法郎……另外再给那个‘体面’的父亲一千法郎。除此之外，再拿出两千法郎由你酌情分配，”他耸了耸肩膀，“分给那些执行抓捕任务的警官以及公寓的老板什么的。我给你五千法郎，希望你马上着手处理此事。可以先让她们获得保释，就说她们的罪名是妨碍社会治安什么的，所需罚款明天见法官时交纳……或通过中间人交纳。”

局长还没说话，迪克就从他的表情看出此项交易是不会有问题的。前者踌躇了片刻，然后说道：“我没有做笔录，因为她们没有身份证。我必须看过……算啦，你把钱给我吧。”

一小时后，迪克和高斯先生把那两位女士送到了宏大旅馆。卡罗琳夫人的司机等在那儿，在她的小车里睡着了。

“别忘了，”迪克说，“你们每人欠高斯先生一百美元。”

“好的，”玛丽回答，“我明天给他一张支票，还有一些感谢费。”

“我不给！”卡罗琳夫人语出惊人，惹得大家都去看她（此时她已恢复了原来的样子，显得大义凛然，神圣不可侵犯），“他们的行为简直就是暴行！我又没有授权，让你们给那些家伙一百美元。”

个子矮小的高斯站在汽车旁，气得两眼冒火，说道：“你真的不给钱吗？”

“她当然要给的。”迪克说。

高斯想起他在伦敦餐馆做杂役时曾受过的侮辱，顿时怒从心头起，恶向胆边生，踏着一片月光走到了卡罗琳夫人的跟前。

他连珠炮一般吐出了一串难听的话。卡罗琳夫人冷笑一声，转身走开了。他紧追一步，飞起一脚踢在了她那极为引人注目的屁股上。卡罗琳夫人猝不及防，双手一扬向前倾倒，就像中了枪子一样，穿着水手装的躯体栽在了人行道上，随即爆发出一阵怒骂声。

迪克提高嗓门说道：“玛丽，你让她别喊了。要不然，用不了十分钟你们俩就会被戴上手铐抓走的！”

在回旅馆的路上，高斯老头一言不发，都已经过了瑞昂莱潘娱乐场，他还在车里的爵士乐声中饮泣和咳嗽。最后，他长叹一声说：“从来没有见过这种女人！交际场上的妓女我倒是认识不少，对她们我是很尊敬的。可是这号女人，我却见都没有见过！”





第十一章


迪克和尼科尔习惯一块儿去发廊，在毗邻的两个房间里理发和洗头。尼科尔可以听见迪克那边咔嚓咔嚓剪头发的声音、数零钱的声音以及道谢和道歉的声音。迪克回来的第二天，他们又去了发廊，一道剪发、洗头，一道闻风扇送来的阵阵香水味。

为了抵挡夏日的暑热，卡尔顿旅馆的窗户紧紧关闭（许多人家的地窖门也是如此）。突然，一辆汽车从旅馆门前驶过，汤米·巴尔班坐在车里。尼科尔一眼瞥去，见他表情严肃、若有所思，而他一看到她，立时瞪大了眼睛，表情也活跃了起来。他的出现深深影响了她——她真想随他而去，离开这里。和女理发师在一起，她觉得纯粹是浪费时间，只恨自己的一生中出现过许多类似的情况，而这发廊就是囚禁她的监狱。女理发师穿着白大褂，嘴角沁出细汗，嘴唇上涂着口红，身上洒了香水，不禁让她想起了诊所里的那一个个护士。

在隔壁房间里，迪克身上围着罩布，脸上抹了剃须液，正坐在那儿打盹儿。尼科尔面前的镜子可以照见男女理发室之间的过道——她见汤米走进了发廊，随即一转身去了男士理发室，这叫她吃了一惊。她心里涌起一阵喜悦，知道最后摊牌的时候到了。

接着，她零零碎碎听见了隔壁传来的几句开场白。

“你好，我想跟你谈谈。”

“是重要的事吗？”

“很重要。”

“完全可以。”

过了一会儿，迪克走进了尼科尔的理发室，一副着恼的表情（他匆匆擦了把脸就过来了，脸上还捂着毛巾）。

“你的朋友激动得不得了，想跟咱俩谈谈。我同意了，觉得应该来个一了百了。你过来吧！”

“可我的头发才剪了一半。”

“别管这些了。快来吧！”

她不悦地让瞪着眼在一旁观看的女理发师把罩布拿开了。

尽管她觉得自己衣着凌乱，未曾打扮，但还是跟着迪克走出了发廊。到了门外，汤米俯身吻了她的手。

“咱们去艾利斯咖啡馆吧。”迪克说。

“只要没人打搅就行。”汤米同意了。

坐在浓浓的树荫下（此处不失为避暑的好地方），迪克问道：“你要喝点什么，尼科尔？”

“来杯柠檬汁吧。”

“给我来半杯。”汤米说。

“我要一份带吸管的‘黑与白’牌威士忌。”迪克说。

“没有‘黑与白’，只有乔尼·沃凯威士忌。”

“那也行。”

她不善言语，

而是性格文静，

所以你应该主动……

“你妻子不爱你，”汤米突然开口说道，“她爱的是我。”

两个男人互相对视着，显露出一种奇特的心虚的神情。他们处境尴尬，心里把握都不大，因为他们的关系是间接的，成败取决于中间的这个女人持什么样的态度，或将要持什么样的态度。他们的情感要通过她传达，而她首鼠两端，就好像是一条性能很差的电话线路。

“请等一等，”迪克说，“给我拿一杯杜松子酒和一根吸管吧。”

“好的，先生。”

“好吧，说下去，汤米。”

“我看得很清楚，你和尼科尔的婚姻已走到了尽头。她已经受够了。为此我等了五年。”

“尼科尔怎么说？”

他们把目光投向了尼科尔。

“我非常喜欢汤米，迪克。”

迪克点了点头。

“你不再真心爱我了，”她接着说，“一言一行纯粹是出于习惯。自从来了个罗斯玛丽，你的心就变了。”

汤米不想让谈话朝这个方向发展，于是便突然插嘴说：“你对尼科尔缺乏理解，觉得她以前得过病，所以老把她当病人看待。”

他们的谈话突然被一个美国人打断了。此人一副猥琐相，喋喋不休地向他们兜售刚从纽约运来的《先驱报》和《时代》杂志。

“这儿什么新闻都有，兄弟。”他滔滔不绝地说着，“到这儿很久了吗？”

“别说啦，快走开！”汤米喊了一声，然后又将脸转向了迪克，“现在没有哪个女人能忍受这种情况……”

“兄弟，”那个美国人又打断了他们的话，“你以为我在浪费你们的时间，但许多人并不这么想。”他从包里掏出一份发灰的剪报——迪克认出这是他曾见过的一份剪报，上面有一幅漫画，画着成群的美国人带着满袋子黄金从轮船上蜂拥而下。“你以为我会不动心，捞他一把吗？实不相瞒，我刚从尼斯过来，要观看环法自行车大赛……”

汤米又大喝一声叫他走开，而迪克这时认出他就是五年前在圣安吉斯大街跟他打过招呼的那个家伙，便冲着他离去的背影喊道：“环法自行车大赛什么时候到这里？”

“随时会到，兄弟。”那人说完，乐呵呵地挥挥手走掉了。

汤米将目光又转回到了迪克身上，说道：“她跟我生活要比跟你更充实。”[36]

“请说英语！你说‘充实’是什么意思？”

“‘充实’？意思就是说她跟我在一起会更幸福。”

“你们彼此不了解。而尼科尔和我在一起度过了许多快乐的时光，汤米。”

“那只不过是过过小日子罢了。”汤米以嘲讽的口气说。

“你要是和尼科尔结婚，难道就不是‘过小日子’吗？”这时嘈杂声四起，打断了他们的谈话。很快就见自行车赛的先行车队出现在了公路上，正在午休的人们三三两两地从午睡中跑来，挤在路边准备观赛。

几个小伙子骑着自行车疾驶而过。几辆汽车顺着公路开了过来，上面满载着衣服上饰有精美流苏的运动员，沿途用高音喇叭开道，宣告比赛的车队马上就要来到。参赛的自行车队出现在公路的转弯处时，谁也没有留意到餐馆的厨师们竟然穿着背心跑到了餐馆门口看热闹。冲在最前面的是一个穿红色运动服的自行车手，背对着一轮西斜的太阳，在人群一阵阵的欢呼声中满怀信心地奋力向前。接着又有三个赛手出现了，身上穿着褪了色的怪里怪气的衣服，腿上的灰尘和汗水混合在一起，凝结成了黄泥块，一个个面无表情，耷拉着眼皮，似乎累到了极点。

汤米冲着迪克说道：“尼科尔可能想跟你离婚……你大概不会设置障碍吧？”

第一拨赛手过去之后，随即而至的是由五十余位赛手组成的长龙，从前到后足有两百码。他们有的面带微笑，表情恬淡；有的显然已精疲力竭；而大多数都神情淡漠，精神不振。一群小孩跟在他们后边跑了过去。再接下来就是几个不服输的落伍者和一辆负责收容的轻型卡车，卡车上载着受伤的和中途退赛的运动员。迪克他们从公路边又回到了餐桌旁。尼科尔想让迪克主动一些，而迪克似乎并不买账，情愿干坐着。二人一副狼狈相——一个刮脸只刮了一半，另一个剪头发也只剪了一半。

“你和我在一起不再感到幸福了，难道这不是事实吗？”尼科尔说道，“没有我，你又可以投身于你的事业了……如果不用为我操心，你的事业可以更上一层楼。”

汤米不耐烦地动了动身子，说道：“现在再怎样也于事无补了。我和尼科尔彼此相爱，这就是问题的核心。”

“那好吧，”迪克说，“既然一切都已决定了，也许我们可以回发廊去了。”

汤米仍不甘心，说道：“有几点需要……”

“我和尼科尔会协商解决的，”迪克心平气和地说，“别担心，原则上我是同意的，我和尼科尔也是可以相互理解的。假如没有外人掺和，我们之间就不太可能会出现不愉快的局面。”

汤米极不情愿地认可了迪克的逻辑，但一种无法抑制的民族特性刺激着他，使他想把便宜占尽。

只听他说道：“现在咱们不妨把话说明白，我是尼科尔的保护人，直至所有的细节都安排妥当。假如你利用和她住在一起的便利，行为不轨，我可不会轻易放过你的。”

“我从不跟缺乏情义的人做爱。”迪克说。

他说完，点点头，回旅馆去了，而尼科尔瞪大眼睛目送着他。

“他还是挺有涵养的。”汤米说，“亲爱的，今天夜里咱们能在一起了吧？”

“我想可以吧。”

这事就这样发生了——好像演出了一幕短剧。尼科尔觉得自己的心思被人猜透了——她意识到，自从发生了那场樟脑油膏事件之后，迪克就预料到会有这么一天的。尽管如此，她还是感到快乐和兴奋——先前，她还有几分尴尬，觉得有必要亲口把一切都向迪克和盘托出，而现在这种尴尬心情烟消云散了。此时她目送着迪克的身影，直至他的身影变成一个黑点，混入了夏日街道上的滚滚人流中。





第十二章


离开里维埃拉的前一天，戴弗医生一整天都跟孩子们在一起。他不再是个满怀美好憧憬和如意梦想的年轻人了，所以，他要把孩子珍藏在心里。孩子们被告知，今年冬天他们要和姨妈住在伦敦，还被告知过不了多久他们就可以去美国看他。双方商定：没有他的同意，不能解雇那位普罗旺斯姑娘。

令他高兴的是，在他的教导下，小女儿很懂事……对于儿子，他心里却没有数——那个爬高上低，喜欢缠人，爱往人怀里钻的小家伙总叫他感到不安。但跟孩子们告别的时候，看着他们漂亮的小脑袋，他真想把他们的脑袋从脖子上取下来，久久地抱在怀里。

他拥抱了老花匠（六年前黛安娜别墅最初的花园就是这位花匠整理出来的）。随后，他吻了吻那个帮助看孩子的普罗旺斯姑娘（她跟随他们差不多有十年了）。那个姑娘跪倒在地哭了起来，迪克急忙把她拉起来，给了她三百法郎。尼科尔仍睡在床上（这是他们事先约定好的）。他给尼科尔和芭比·沃伦各留了一张便条——后者刚从意大利撒丁岛过来，住在他们家里。然后，他从别人送给他们的一只高三英尺、容量为十夸脱的白兰地酒瓶里为自己斟了一大杯酒喝了下去。

最后，他决定叫人将行李送到戛纳车站去，他自己要最后去看一眼高斯旅馆前的那片海滩。

当天上午，尼科尔和她姐姐来到海滩上的时候，看见那里只有几个早早就跑来玩的孩子。一轮惨白的太阳悬挂在白晃晃的天空上懒懒地照耀着，四周无一丝风。几个侍者在往酒柜里加冰块。一位美联社的摄影记者在一处不稳定的阴凉地手持照相机严阵以待，每当有脚步声从石阶上下来，他都要飞快地抬头看一下。而他要收入镜头中的人清晨刚服过安眠药，此时在旅馆阴暗的房间里睡得正香。

尼科尔来到海滩后，看见迪克穿戴整齐地高坐在一块岩石上，惊得她身子朝后一缩，退回到了更衣帐篷的阴影里。不一会儿，芭比走过来说：“迪克还没走呢。”

“我看见他了。”

“我觉得他应该知趣而退，离开这里。”

“这是他的家嘛——可以说，是他发现了这块沙滩。高斯老人家总说自己能有今日多亏了他。”

芭比平静地看着妹妹，说道：“他喜欢骑自行车周游四方，当初就不应该打搅他。一个人一旦偏离了自己的轨道，不管他表面怎么样，内心一定茫然不知所措。”

“六年来，我觉得迪克一直是个好丈夫。”尼科尔说，“在这六年里，我从来没有吃过苦遭过罪——他尽一切力量保护我，不让我受到伤害。”

芭比微微翘了翘下巴说：“这要归功于他的涵养。”

姐妹俩静静地坐着。尼科尔身心疲惫，思绪万千。芭比也在想自己的心事，考虑着该不该嫁给最近一个向她求婚的人——那人虽然看中的是她的钱，但的确是正统的哈布斯堡王室[37]成员。对于这件事她并不十分在意，因为这种事她经历得多了。随着自己容颜渐老，她对谈婚论嫁比对婚姻本身更感兴趣，因为只有在谈婚论嫁的过程中她才能感受到自己真正的价值。

“他走了吗？”尼科尔稍后问，“我想他坐的那班火车是中午开的。”

芭比抬头看了看说：“还没走。他到露台上去了，正和几个女子说话呢。别管他，人那么多，他是看不见咱们的。”

其实，她们离开更衣帐篷时，迪克就看见了她们，一直望着她们，直到她们的身影再次消失。此时，他正跟玛丽·明盖蒂坐在一起喝茴香酒。

“那天晚上你帮助我们，又像过去那样仗义了。”玛丽说，“只不过到了最后，你不该对卡罗琳态度那么生硬。你为什么不能始终如一以和蔼的态度对待别人呢？你是能够做到的呀。”

听着玛丽·诺思在教导他如何做人，迪克觉得十分可笑。

“你的朋友们仍然喜欢你，迪克。不过，你不该喝多了酒便出口伤人。今年夏天，我可没少出面为你辩解。”

“这可是艾略特博士[38]的一句非常经典的话。”

“这倒是真的。你喝不喝酒别人并不管……”说到这里，她犹豫了一下，“问题在于：即便阿贝喝得酩酊大醉，也不像你那么张嘴便得罪人。”

“你们都太拘谨了。”

“但我们明白事理！”玛丽叫了起来，“要是你不喜欢正派人，那你就去跟不正派的人打打交道，看你喜欢不喜欢！所有的人都想快乐地生活，你要是让他们不快乐，就等于切断了你自己获取快乐的养分。”

“我有过这样的养分吗？”迪克问。

玛丽兴致很高，只不过她意识不到罢了，因为她陪他坐下来完全是因为心里对他有一种敬畏感。当她再次拒绝迪克的劝酒时，只听她说道：“说到底，酗酒的原因是自我放纵。当然，阿贝去世后，你可以想象我对酗酒有着什么样的感受——我是眼睁睁看着一个好人一点点染上了酗酒的恶习。”

这时，卡罗琳·西布利-比尔斯夫人踏着轻松的步子，仪态万方地走下了台阶。

迪克感觉良好——他已经有点飘飘然了，有一种刚刚吃完大餐、酒足饭饱的心态。不过，他是有分寸的，仅仅是对玛丽示好，对她表示关怀而已。一时间，他的眼睛变得清澈明亮，就像天真的孩子，只想得到她的同情。像过去一样，他心潮涌动，只想让她相信：世界上只剩下了他和她这一对孤男寡女。

……这样，他就不必去看另外两个人了——那是一男一女，一个穿白，一个着黑，在天幕下闪着光彩……[39]

“你曾喜欢过我，是吗？”他问。

“何止喜欢——我爱过你。每个人都爱你。你只要开口，想得到谁就可以得到谁……”

“你我之间有一种特殊的感情。”

她一听，激动地问：“是吗，迪克？”

“这种感情一直存在……我了解你艰难的处境，也了解你是如何勇敢面对困难的。”说到这里，他心里直想笑，觉得自己恐怕再也憋不了多久了。

“我一直觉得你是个善解人意的人，”玛丽心潮澎湃地说，“比任何人都了解我。也许，正因为这个缘故，咱俩相处得不太融洽的时候，我有点怕你。”

他温情、体贴地看着她的眼睛，显露出一种含蓄的感情。顿时，二人的目光交融在一起，难舍难分。可是，他心里的笑声又起，声音之大，真怕玛丽会听见。他急忙将目光移开了——他们的目光又转向了里维埃拉阳光下的景物。

“我得走了。”他说着站了起来，身子有点摇晃，感觉不太舒服，可能是血液流动不畅的缘故。他站在高高的露台上，抬起右手，画了个十字，为这片沙滩祝福。有好几把遮阳伞下的人都抬起了脸来，朝这边张望。

“我要去见见他。”尼科尔跪起身子说。

“不，你别去。”汤米紧紧地拽住她说，“别招惹他了。”





第十三章


尼科尔新婚后仍同迪克保持着联系。他们互通书信，谈生意，也谈孩子。每当她说“我爱过迪克，永远也不会忘记他”时，汤米总是回答“当然不会——你为什么要忘记他呢？”

迪克在布法罗开了家诊所，但显然并不成功。尼科尔不清楚问题出在哪儿，但几个月后她听说，他到了纽约州的一个名叫巴塔维亚的小镇，在那里以一个普通医生的身份行医。后来他去了洛克波特，从事同样的工作。出于偶然，她对他在彼处的生活有了比较深入的了解，知道他常骑自行车，很受女性的崇拜，办公桌上总放着大叠的稿纸，据说是有关某个医学课题的重要学术论文，眼看就要完稿。在人们的眼里，他是个行为得当的人，曾在一个有关健康的公众集会上就毒品问题做过一次精彩的演讲，可是后来跟一家杂货店的年轻女店员有了纠缠不清的关系，还因为医疗纠纷陷入了一场官司。末了，他离开了洛克波特。

那以后，他就不再要求把孩子们送到美国跟他见面了，尼科尔写信问他是否需要钱，他也不回信答复。在给尼科尔的最后一封信中，他说自己正在纽约州的日内瓦镇行医。尼科尔有一种感觉：他已安顿了下来，有人替他管家了。她在地图册里寻找日内瓦镇的位置，发现它位于芬格湖区的中心地带，觉得那是个挺不错的地方。她心里暗想：也许他在等待时机，准备大展宏图，就像格兰特当年在格里纳一样。他的最后一封信盖的是纽约州霍内尔的邮戳，那地方距日内瓦镇有一段距离，是个弹丸之地。不管怎样吧，可以肯定的是，他就生活在那个地区，不是这个镇子，就是那个镇子。

Already with thee! Tender is the night,

…But here there is no light,

Save what from heaven is with the breezes blown

Through verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways.

1


On the pleasant shore of the French Riviera, about half way between Marseilles and the Italian border, stands a large, proud, rose-colored hotel. Deferential palms cool its flushed façade, and before it stretches a short dazzling beach. Lately it has become a summer resort of notable and fashionable people; a decade ago it was almost deserted after its English clientele went north in April. Now, many bungalows cluster near it, but when this story begins only the cupolas of a dozen old villas rotted like water lilies among the massed pines between Gausse’s Hôtel des Étrangers and Cannes, five miles away.

The hotel and its bright tan prayer rug of a beach were one. In the early morning the distant image of Cannes, the pink and cream of old fortifications, the purple Alp that bounded Italy, were cast across the water and lay quavering in the ripples and rings sent up by sea-plants through the clear shallows. Before eight a man came down to the beach in a blue bathrobe and with much preliminary application to his person of the chilly water, and much grunting and loud breathing, floundered a minute in the sea. When he had gone, beach and bay were quiet for an hour. Merchantmen crawled westward on the horizon; bus boys shouted in the hotel court; the dew dried upon the pines. In another hour the horns of motors began to blow down from the winding road along the low range of the Maures, which separates the littoral from true Provençal France.

A mile from the sea, where pines give way to dusty poplars, is an isolated railroad stop, whence one June morning in 1925 a victoria brought a woman and her daughter down to Gausse’s Hôtel. The mother’s face was of a fading prettiness that would soon be patted with broken veins; her expression was both tranquil and aware in a pleasant way.However, one’s eyes moved on quickly to her daughter, who had magic in her pink palms and her cheeks lit to a lovely flame, like the thrilling flush of children after their cold baths in the evening. Her fine forehead sloped gently up to where her hair, bordering it like an armorial shield, burst into lovelocks and waves and curlicues of ash blonde and gold. Her eyes were bright, big, clear, wet, and shining, the color of her cheeks was real, breaking close to the surface from the strong young pump of her heart. Her body hovered delicately on the last edge of childhood—she was almost eighteen, nearly complete, but the dew was still on her.

As sea and sky appeared below them in a thin, hot line the mother said:

“Something tells me we’re not going to like this place.”

“I want to go home anyhow,” the girl answered.

They both spoke cheerfully but were obviously without direction and bored by the fact—moreover, just any direction would not do. They wanted high excitement, not from the necessity of stimulating jaded nerves but with the avidity of prize-winning schoolchildren who deserved their vacations.

“We’ll stay three days and then go home. I’ll wire right away for steamer tickets.”

At the hotel the girl made the reservation in idiomatic but rather flat French, like something remembered. When they were installed on the ground floor she walked into the glare of the French windows and out a few steps onto the stone veranda that ran the length of the hotel. When she walked she carried herself like a ballet-dancer, not slumped down on her hips but held up in the small of her back. Out there the hot light clipped close her shadow and she retreated—it was too bright to see. Fifty yards away the Mediterranean yielded up its pigments, moment by moment, to the brutal sunshine; below the balustrade a faded Buick cooked on the hotel drive.

Indeed, of all the region only the beach stirred with activity. Three British nannies sat knitting the slow pattern of Victorian England, the pattern of the forties, the sixties, and the eighties, into sweaters and socks, to the tune of gossip as formalized as incantation; closer to the sea a dozen persons kept house under striped umbrellas, while their dozen children pursued unintimidated fish through the shallows or lay naked and glistening with cocoanut oil out in the sun.

As Rosemary came onto the beach a boy of twelve ran past her and dashed into the sea with exultant cries. Feeling the impactive scrutiny of strange faces, she took off her bathrobe and followed. She floated face down for a few yards and finding it shallow staggered to her feet and plodded forward, dragging slim legs like weights against the resistance of the water. When it was about breast high, she glanced back toward shore: a bald man in a monocle and a pair of tights, his tufted chest thrown out, his brash navel sucked in, was regarding her attentively. As Rosemary returned the gaze the man dislodged the monocle, which went into hiding amid the facetious whiskers of his chest, and poured himself a glass of something from a bottle in his hand.

Rosemary laid her face on the water and swam a choppy little four-beat crawl out to the raft. The water reached up for her, pulled her down tenderly out of the heat, seeped in her hair and ran into the corners of her body. She turned round and round in it, embracing it, wallowing in it. Reaching the raft she was out of breath, but a tanned woman with very white teeth looked down at her, and Rosemary, suddenly conscious of the raw whiteness of her own body, turned on her back and drifted toward shore. The hairy man holding the bottle spoke to her as she came out.

“I say—they have sharks out behind the raft.” He was of indeterminate nationality, but spoke English with a slow Oxford drawl. “Yesterday they devoured two British sailors from the flotte at Golfe-Juan.”

“Heavens!” exclaimed Rosemary.

“They come in for the refuse from the flotte.”

Glazing his eyes to indicate that he had only spoken in order to warn her, he minced off two steps and poured himself another drink.

Not unpleasantly self-conscious, since there had been a slight sway of attention toward her during this conversation, Rosemary looked for a place to sit. Obviously each family possessed the strip of sand immediately in front of its umbrella; besides there was much visiting and talking back and forth—the atmosphere of a community upon which it would be presumptuous to intrude. Farther up, where the beach was strewn with pebbles and dead sea-weed, sat a group with flesh as white as her own. They lay under small hand-parasols instead of beach umbrellas and were obviously less indigenous to the place. Between the dark people and the light, Rosemary found room and spread out her peignoir on the sand.

Lying so, she first heard their voices and felt their feet skirt her body and their shapes pass between the sun and herself. The breath of an inquisitive dog blew warm and nervous on her neck; she could feel her skin broiling a little in the heat and hear the small exhausted wa-waa of the expiring waves. Presently her ear distinguished individual voices and she became aware that some one referred to scornfully as “that North guy” had kidnapped a waiter from a café in Cannes last night in order to saw him in two. The sponsor of the story was a white-haired woman in full evening dress, obviously a relic of the previous evening, for a tiara still clung to her head and a discouraged orchid expired from her shoulder. Rosemary, forming a vague antipathy to her and her companions, turned away.

Nearest her, on the other side, a young woman lay under a roof of umbrellas making out a list of things from a book open on the sand. Her bathing suit was pulled off her shoulders and her back, a ruddy, orange brown, set off by a string of creamy pearls, shone in the sun. Her face was hard and lovely and pitiful. Her eyes met Rosemary’s but did not see her. Beyond her was a fine man in a jockey cap and red-striped tights; then the woman Rosemary had seen on the raft, and who looked back at her, seeing her; then a man with a long face and a golden, leonine head, with blue tights and no hat, talking very seriously to an unmistakably Latin young man in black tights, both of them picking at little pieces of sea-weed in the sand. She thought they were mostly Americans, but something made them unlike the Americans she had known of late.

After a while she realized that the man in the jockey cap was giving a quiet little performance for this group; he moved gravely about with a rake, ostensibly removing gravel and meanwhile developing some esoteric burlesque held in suspension by his grave face. Its faintest ramification had become hilarious, until whatever he said released a burst of laughter. Even those who, like herself, were too far away to hear, sent out antennæ of attention until the only person on the beach not caught up in it was the young woman with the string of pearls. Perhaps from modesty of possession she responded to each salvo of amusement by bending closer over her list.

The man of the monocle and bottle spoke suddenly out of the sky above Rosemary.

“You are a ripping swimmer.”

She demurred.

“Jolly good. My name is Campion. Here is a lady who says she saw you in Sorrento last week and knows who you are and would so like to meet you.”

Glancing around with concealed annoyance Rosemary saw the untanned people were waiting. Reluctantly she got up and went over to them.

“Mrs. Abrams—Mrs. McKisco—Mr. McKisco—Mr. Dumphry—”

“We know who you are,” spoke up the woman in evening dress.“You’re Rosemary Hoyt and I recognized you in Sorrento and asked the hotel clerk and we all think you’re perfectly marvellous and we want to know why you’re not back in America making another marvellous moving picture.”

They made a superfluous gesture of moving over for her. The woman who had recognized her was not a Jewess, despite her name. She was one of those elderly “good sports” preserved by an imperviousness to experience and a good digestion into another generation.

“We wanted to warn you about getting burned the first day,” she continued cheerily, “because your skin is important, but there seems to be so darn much formality on this beach that we didn’t know whether you’d mind.”

“We thought maybe you were in the plot,” said Mrs. McKisco.She was a shabby-eyed, pretty young woman with a disheartening intensity. “We don’t know who’s in the plot and who isn’t. One man my husband had been particularly nice to turned out to be a chief character—practically the assistant hero.”

“The plot?” inquired Rosemary, half understanding. “Is there a plot?”

“My dear, we don’t know,” said Mrs. Abrams, with a convulsive, stout woman’s chuckle. “We’re not in it. We’re the gallery.”

Mr. Dumphry, a tow-headed effeminate young man, remarked:“Mama Abrams is a plot in herself,” and Campion shook his monocle at him, saying:“Now, Royal, don’t be too ghastly for words.” Rosemary looked at them all uncomfortably, wishing her mother had come down here with her. She did not like these people, especially in her immediate comparison of them with those who had interested her at the other end of the beach. Her mother’s modest but compact social gift got them out of unwelcome situations swiftly and firmly. But Rosemary had been a celebrity for only six months, and sometimes the French manners of her early adolescence and the democratic manners of America, these latter superimposed, made a certain confusion and let her in for just such things.

Mr. McKisco, a scrawny, freckle-and-red man of thirty, did not find the topic of the “plot” amusing. He had been staring at the sea—now after a swift glance at his wife he turned to Rosemary and demanded aggressively:

“Been here long?”

“Only a day.”

“Oh.”

Evidently feeling that the subject had been thoroughly changed, he looked in turn at the others.

“Going to stay all summer?” asked Mrs. McKisco, innocently. “If you do you can watch the plot unfold.”

“For God’s sake, Violet, drop the subject!” exploded her husband.“Get a new joke, for God’s sake!”

Mrs. McKisco swayed toward Mrs. Abrams and breathed audibly:

“He’s nervous.”

“I’m not nervous,” disagreed McKisco. “It just happens I’m not nervous at all.”

He was burning visibly—a grayish flush had spread over his face, dissolving all his expressions into a vast ineffectuality. Suddenly remotely conscious of his condition he got up to go in the water, followed by his wife, and seizing the opportunity Rosemary followed.

Mr. McKisco drew a long breath, flung himself into the shallows and began a stiff-armed batting of the Mediterranean, obviously intended to suggest a crawl—his breath exhausted he arose and looked around with an expression of surprise that he was still in sight of shore.

“I haven’t learned to breathe yet. I never quite understood how they breathed.” He looked at Rosemary inquiringly.

“I think you breathe out under water,” she explained. “And every fourth beat you roll your head over for air.”

“The breathing’s the hardest part for me. Shall we go to the raft.”

The man with the leonine head lay stretched out upon the raft, which tipped back and forth with the motion of the water. As Mrs. McKisco reached for it a sudden tilt struck her arm up roughly, whereupon the man started up and pulled her on board.

“I was afraid it hit you.” His voice was slow and shy; he had one of the saddest faces Rosemary had ever seen, the high cheek-bones of an Indian, a long upper lip, and enormous deep-set dark golden eyes. He had spoken out of the side of his mouth, as if he hoped his words would reach Mrs. McKisco by a circuitous and unobtrusive route; in a minute he had shoved off into the water and his long body lay motionless toward shore.

Rosemary and Mrs. McKisco watched him. When he had exhausted his momentum he abruptly bent double, his thin thighs rose above the surface, and he disappeared totally, leaving scarcely a fleck of foam behind.

“He’s a good swimmer,” Rosemary said.

Mrs. McKisco’s answer came with surprising violence.

“Well, he’s a rotten musician.” She turned to her husband, who after two unsuccessful attempts had managed to climb on the raft, and having attained his balance was trying to make some kind of compensatory flourish, achieving only an extra stagger. “I was just saying that Abe North may be a good swimmer but he’s a rotten musician.”

“Yes,” agreed McKisco, grudgingly. Obviously he had created his wife’s world, and allowed her few liberties in it.

“Antheil’s my man.” Mrs. McKisco turned challengingly to Rosemary, “Anthiel and Joyce. I don’t suppose you ever hear much about those sort of people in Hollywood, but my husband wrote the first criticism of Ulysses that ever appeared in America.”

“I wish I had a cigarette,” said McKisco calmly. “That’s more important to me just now.”

“He’s got insides—don’t you think so, Albert.”

Her voice faded off suddenly. The woman of the pearls had joined her two children in the water, and now Abe North came up under one of them like a volcanic island, raising him on his shoulders. The child yelled with fear and delight and the woman watched with a lovely peace, without a smile.

“Is that his wife?” Rosemary asked.

“No, that’s Mrs. Diver. They’re not at the hotel.” Her eyes, photographic, did not move from the woman’s face. After a moment she turned vehemently to Rosemary.

“Have you been abroad before?”

“Yes—I went to school in Paris.”

“Oh! Well then you probably know that if you want to enjoy yourself here the thing is to get to know some real French families. What do these people get out of it?” She pointed her left shoulder toward shore. “They just stick around with each other in little cliques. Of course, we had letters of introduction and met all the best French artists and writers in Paris. That made it very nice.”

“I should think so.”

“My husband is finishing his first novel, you see.”

Rosemary said:“Oh, he is.” She was not thinking anything special, except wondering whether her mother had got to sleep in this heat.

“It’s on the idea of Ulysses,” continued Mrs. McKisco. “Only instead of taking twenty-four hours my husband takes a hundred years. He takes a decayed old French aristocrat and puts him in contrast with the mechanical age—”

“Oh, for God’s sake, Violet, don’t go telling everybody the idea,” protested McKisco. “I don’t want it to get all around before the book’s published.”

Rosemary swam back to the shore, where she threw her peignoir over her already sore shoulders and lay down again in the sun. The man with the jockey cap was now going from umbrella to umbrella carrying a bottle and little glasses in his hands; presently he and his friends grew livelier and closer together and now they were all under a single assemblage of umbrellas—she gathered that some one was leaving and that this was a last drink on the beach. Even the children knew that excitement was generating under that umbrella and turned toward it—and it seemed to Rosemary that it all came from the man in the jockey cap.

Noon dominated sea and sky—even the white line of Cannes, five miles off, had faded to a mirage of what was fresh and cool; a robin-breasted sailing boat pulled in behind it a strand from the outer, darker sea. It seemed that there was no life anywhere in all this expanse of coast except under the filtered sunlight of those umbrellas, where something went on amid the color and the murmur.

Campion walked near her, stood a few feet away and Rosemary closed her eyes, pretending to be asleep; then she half-opened them and watched two dim, blurred pillars that were legs. The man tried to edge his way into a sand-colored cloud, but the cloud floated off into the vast hot sky. Rosemary fell really asleep.

She awoke drenched with sweat to find the beach deserted save for the man in the jockey cap, who was folding a last umbrella. As Rosemary lay blinking, he walked nearer and said:

“I was going to wake you before I left. It’s not good to get too burned right away.”

“Thank you.” Rosemary looked down at her crimson legs. “Heavens!”

She laughed cheerfully, inviting him to talk, but Dick Diver was already carrying a tent and a beach umbrella up to a waiting car, so she went into the water to wash off the sweat. He came back and gathering up a rake, a shovel, and a sieve, stowed them in a crevice of a rock. He glanced up and down the beach to see if he had left anything.

“Do you know what time it is?” Rosemary asked.

“It’s about half-past one.”

They faced the seascape together momentarily.

“It’s not a bad time,” said Dick Diver. “It’s not one of the worst times of the day.”

He looked at her and for a moment she lived in the bright blue worlds of his eyes, eagerly and confidently. Then he shouldered his last piece of junk and went up to his car, and Rosemary came out of the water, shook out her peignoir and walked up to the hotel.

It was almost two when they went into the dining-room. Back and forth over the deserted tables a heavy pattern of beams and shadows swayed with the motion of the pines outside. Two waiters, piling plates and talking loud Italian, fell silent when they came in and brought them a tired version of the table d’hôte luncheon.

“I fell in love on the beach,” said Rosemary.

“Who with?”

“First with a whole lot of people who looked nice. Then with one man.”

“Did you talk to him?”

“Just a little. Very handsome. With reddish hair.” She was eating, ravenously. “He’s married though—it’s usually the way.”

Her mother was her best friend and had put every last possibility into the guiding of her, not so rare a thing in the theatrical profession, but rather special in that Mrs. Elsie Speers was not recompensing herself for a defeat of her own. She had no personal bitterness or resentments about life—twice satisfactorily married and twice widowed, her cheerful stoicism had each time deepened. One of her husbands had been a cavalry officer and one an army doctor, and they both left something to her that she tried to present intact to Rosemary. By not sparing Rosemary she had made her hard—by not sparing her own labor and devotion she had cultivated an idealism in Rosemary, which at present was directed toward herself and saw the world through her eyes. So that while Rosemary was a “simple” child she was protected by a double sheath of her mother’s armor and her own—she had a mature distrust of the trivial, the facile and the vulgar. However, with Rosemary’s sudden success in pictures Mrs. Speers felt that it was time she were spiritually weaned; it would please rather than pain her if this somewhat bouncing, breathless and exigent idealism would focus on something except herself.

“Then you like it here?” she asked.

“It might be fun if we knew those people. There were some other people, but they weren’t nice. They recognized me—no matter where we go everybody’s seen ‘Daddy’s Girl.’ ”

Mrs. Speers waited for the glow of egotism to subside; then she said in a matter-of-fact way:“That reminds me, when are you going to see Earl Brady.”

“I thought we might go this afternoon—if you’re rested.”

“You go—I’m not going.”

“We’ll wait till to-morrow then.”

“I want you to go alone. It’s only a short way—it isn’t as if you didn’t speak French.”

“Mother—aren’t there some things I don’t have to do.”

“Oh, well then go later—but some day before we leave.”

“All right, Mother.”

After lunch they were both overwhelmed by the sudden flatness that comes over American travellers in quiet foreign places. No stimuli worked upon them, no voices called them from without, no fragments of their own thoughts came suddenly from the minds of others, and missing the clamor of Empire they felt that life was not continuing here.

“Let’s only stay three days, Mother,” Rosemary said when they were back in their rooms. Outside a light wind blew the heat around, straining it through the trees and sending little hot gusts through the shutters.

“How about the man you fell in love with on the beach?”

“I don’t love anybody but you, Mother, darling.”

Rosemary stopped in the lobby and spoke to Gausse père about trains. The concierge, lounging in light-brown khaki by the desk, stared at her rigidly, then suddenly remembered the manners of his métier. She took the bus and rode with a pair of obsequious waiters to the station, embarrassed by their deferential silence, wanting to urge them:“Go on, talk, enjoy yourselves. It doesn’t bother me.”

The first-class compartment was stifling; the vivid advertising cards of the railroad companies—The Pont du Gard at Arles, the Amphitheatre at Orange, winter sports at Chamonix—were fresher than the long motionless sea outside. Unlike American trains that were absorbed in an intense destiny of their own, and scornful of people on another world less swift and breathless, this train was part of the country through which it passed. Its breath stirred the dust from the palm leaves, the cinders mingled with the dry dung in the gardens. Rosemary was sure she could lean from the window and pull flowers with her hand.

A dozen cabbies slept in their hacks outside the Cannes station. Over on the promenade the Casino, the smart shops, and the great hotels turned blank iron masks to the summer sea. It was unbelievable that there could ever have been a “season,” and Rosemary, half in the grip of fashion, became a little self-conscious, as though she were displaying an unhealthy taste for the moribund; as though people were wondering why she was here in the lull between the gaiety of last winter and next winter, while up north the true world thundered by.

As she came out of a drug store with a bottle of cocoanut oil, a woman, whom she recognized as Mrs. Diver, crossed her path with arms full of sofa cushions, and went to a car parked down the street. A long, low black dog barked at her, a dozing chauffeur woke with a start. She sat in the car, her lovely face set, controlled, her eyes brave and watchful, looking straight ahead toward nothing. Her dress was bright red and her brown legs were bare. She had thick, dark, gold hair like a chow’s.

With half an hour to wait for her train Rosemary sat down in the Café des Alliés on the Croisette, where the trees made a green twilight over the tables and an orchestra wooed an imaginary public of cosmopolites with the “Nice Carnival Song” and last year’s American tune. She had bought Le Temps and The Saturday Evening Post for her mother, and as she drank her citronnade she opened the latter at the memoirs of a Russian princess, finding the dim conventions of the nineties realer and nearer than the headlines of the French paper. It was the same feeling that had oppressed her at the hotel—accustomed to seeing the starkest grotesqueries of a continent heavily underlined as comedy or tragedy, untrained to the task of separating out the essential for herself, she now began to feel that French life was empty and stale. This feeling was surcharged by listening to the sad tunes of the orchestra, reminiscent of the melancholy music played for acrobats in vaudeville. She was glad to go back to Gausse’s Hôtel.

Her shoulders were too burned to swim with the next day, so she and her mother hired a car—after much haggling, for Rosemary had formed her valuations of money in France—and drove along the Riviera, the delta of many rivers. The chauffeur, a Russian czar of the period of Ivan the Terrible, was a self-appointed guide, and the resplendent names—Cannes, Nice, Monte Carlo—began to glow through their torpid camouflage, whispering of old kings come here to dine or die, of rajahs tossing Buddha’s eyes to English ballerinas, of Russian princes turning the weeks into Baltic twilights in the lost caviare days. Most of all, there was the scent of the Russians along the coast—their closed book shops and grocery stores. Ten years ago, when the season ended in April, the doors of the Orthodox Church were locked, and the sweet champagnes they favored were put away until their return. “We’ll be back next season,” they said, but this was premature, for they were never coming back any more.

It was pleasant to drive back to the hotel in the late afternoon, above a sea as mysteriously colored as the agates and cornelians of childhood, green as green milk, blue as laundry water, wine dark. It was pleasant to pass people eating outside their doors, and to hear the fierce mechanical pianos behind the vines of country estaminets. When they turned off the Corniche d’Or and down to Gausse’s Hôtel through the darkening banks of trees, set one behind another in many greens, the moon already hovered over the ruins of the aqueducts….

Somewhere in the hills behind the hotel there was a dance, and Rosemary listened to the music through the ghostly moonshine of her mosquito net, realizing that there was gaiety too somewhere about, and she thought of the nice people on the beach. She thought she might meet them in the morning, but they obviously formed a self-sufficient little group, and once their umbrellas, bamboo rugs, dogs, and children were set out in place the part of the plage was literally fenced in. She resolved in any case not to spend her last two mornings with the other ones.

The matter was solved for her. The McKiscos were not yet there and she had scarcely spread her peignoir when two men—the man with the jockey cap and the tall blonde man, given to sawing waiters in two—left the group and came down toward her.

“Good morning,” said Dick Diver. He broke down. “Look—sunburn or no sunburn, why did you stay away yesterday? We worried about you.”

She sat up and her happy little laugh welcomed their intrusion.

“We wondered,” Dick Diver said, “if you wouldn’t come over this morning. We go in, we take food and drink, so it’s a substantial invitation.”

He seemed kind and charming—his voice promised that he would take care of her, and that a little later he would open up whole new worlds for her, unroll an endless succession of magnificent possibilities. He managed the introduction so that her name wasn’t mentioned and then let her know easily that everyone knew who she was but was respecting the completeness of her private life—a courtesy that Rosemary had not met with save from professional people since her success.

Nicole Diver, her brown back hanging from her pearls, was looking through a recipe book for chicken Maryland. She was about twenty-four, Rosemary guessed—her face could have been described in terms of conventional prettiness, but the effect was that it had been made first on the heroic scale with strong structure and marking, as if the features and vividness of brow and coloring, everything we associate with temperament and character, had been molded with a Rodinesque intention, and then chiseled away in the direction of prettiness to a point where a single slip would have irreparably diminished its force and quality. With the mouth the sculptor had taken desperate chances—it was the cupid’s bow of a magazine cover, yet it shared the distinction of the rest.

“Are you here for a long time?” Nicole asked. Her voice was low, almost harsh.

Suddenly Rosemary let the possibility enter her mind that they might stay another week.

“Not very long,” she answered vaguely. “We’ve been abroad a long time—we landed in Sicily in March and we’ve been slowly working our way north. I got pneumonia making a picture last January and I’ve been recuperating.”

“Mercy! How did that happen?”

“Well, it was from swimming,” Rosemary was rather reluctant at embarking upon personal revelations. “One day I happened to have the grippe and didn’t know it, and they were taking a scene where I dove into a canal in Venice. It was a very expensive set, so I had to dive and dive and dive all morning. Mother had a doctor right there, but it was no use—I got pneumonia.” She changed the subject determinedly before they could speak. “Do you like it here—this place.”

“They have to like it,” said Abe North slowly. “They invented it.” He turned his noble head slowly so that his eyes rested with tenderness and affection on the two Divers.

“Oh, did you?”

“This is only the second season that the hotel’s been open in summer,” Nicole explained. “We persuaded Gausse to keep on a cook and a garçon and a chasseur—it paid its way and this year it’s doing even better.”

“But you’re not in the hotel.”

“We built a house, up at Tarmes.”

“The theory is,” said Dick, arranging an umbrella to clip a square of sunlight off Rosemary’s shoulder, “that all the northern places, like Deauville, were picked out by Russians and English who don’t mind the cold, while half of us Americans come from tropical climates—that’s why we’re beginning to come here.”

The young man of Latin aspect had been turning the pages of The New York Herald.

“Well, what nationality are these people?” he demanded, suddenly, and read with a slight French intonation, “‘Registered at the Hotel Palace at Vevey are Mr. Pandely Vlasco, Mme. Bonneasse’—I don’t exaggerate—‘Corinna Medonca, Mme. Pasche, Seraphim Tullio, Maria Amalia Roto Mais, Moises Teubel, Mme. Paragoris, Apostle Alexandre, Yolanda Yosfuglu and Geneveva de Momus!’ She attracts me most—Geneveva de Momus. Almost worth running up to Vevey to take a look at Geneveva de Momus.”

He stood up with sudden restlessness, stretching himself with one sharp movement. He was a few years younger than Diver or North. He was tall and his body was hard but overspare save for the bunched force gathered in his shoulders and upper arms. At first glance he seemed conventionally handsome—but there was a faint disgust always in his face which marred the full fierce lustre of his brown eyes. Yet one remembered them afterward, when one had forgotten the inability of the mouth to endure boredom and the young forehead with its furrows of fretful and unprofitable pain.

“We found some fine ones in the news of Americans last week,” said Nicole. “Mrs. Evelyn Oyster and—what were the others?”

“There was Mr. S. Flesh,” said Diver, getting up also. He took his rake and began to work seriously at getting small stones out of the sand.

“Oh, yes—S. Flesh—doesn’t he give you the creeps?”

It was quiet alone with Nicole—Rosemary found it even quieter than with her mother. Abe North and Barban, the Frenchman, were talking about Morocco, and Nicole having copied her recipe picked up a piece of sewing. Rosemary examined their appurtenances—four large parasols that made a canopy of shade, a portable bath house for dressing, a pneumatic rubber horse, new things that Rosemary had never seen, from the first burst of luxury manufacturing after the War, and probably in the hands of the first of purchasers. She had gathered that they were fashionable people, but though her mother had brought her up to beware such people as drones, she did not feel that way here. Even in their absolute immobility, complete as that of the morning, she felt a purpose, a working over something, a direction, an act of creation different from any she had known. Her immature mind made no speculations upon the nature of their relation to each other, she was only concerned with their attitude toward herself—but she perceived the web of some pleasant inter-relation, which she expressed with the thought that they seemed to have a very good time.

She looked in turn at the three men, temporarily expropriating them. All three were personable in different ways; all were of a special gentleness that she felt was part of their lives, past and future, not circumstanced by events, not at all like the company manners of actors, and she detected also a far-reaching delicacy that was different from the rough and ready good fellowship of directors, who represented the intellectuals in her life. Actors and directors—those were the only men she had ever known, those and the heterogeneous, indistinguishable mass of college boys, interested only in love at first sight, whom she had met at the Yale prom last fall.

These three were different. Barban was less civilized, more skeptical and scoffing, his manners were formal, even perfunctory. Abe North had, under his shyness, a desperate humor that amused but puzzled her. Her serious nature distrusted its ability to make a supreme impression on him.

But Dick Diver—he was all complete there. Silently she admired him. His complexion was reddish and weather-burned, so was his short hair—a light growth of it rolled down his arms and hands. His eyes were of a bright, hard blue. His nose was somewhat pointed and there was never any doubt at whom he was looking or talking—and this is a flattering attention, for who looks at us?—glances fall upon us, curious or disinterested, nothing more. His voice, with some faint Irish melody running through it, wooed the world, yet she felt the layer of hardness in him, of self-control and of self-discipline, her own virtues. Oh, she chose him, and Nicole, lifting her head, saw her choose him, heard the little sigh at the fact that he was already possessed.

Toward noon the McKiscos, Mrs. Abrams, Mr. Dumphry, and Sẽnor Campion came on the beach. They had brought a new umbrella that they set up with side glances toward the Divers, and crept under with satisfied expressions—all save Mr. McKisco, who remained derisively without. In his raking Dick had passed near them and now he returned to the umbrellas.

“The two young men are reading the Book of Etiquette together,” he said in a low voice.

“Planning to mix wit de quality,” said Abe.

Mary North, the very tanned young woman whom Rosemary had encountered the first day on the raft, came in from swimming and said with a smile that was a rakish gleam:

“So Mr. and Mrs. Neverquiver have arrived.”

“They’re this man’s friends,” Nicole reminded her, indicating Abe. “Why doesn’t he go and speak to them? Don’t you think they’re attractive?”

“I think they’re very attractive,” Abe agreed. “I just don’t think they’re attractive, that’s all.”

“Well, I have felt there were too many people on the beach this summer,” Nicole admitted. “Our beach that Dick made out of a pebble pile.” She considered, and then lowering her voice out of the range of the trio of nannies who sat back under another umbrella. “Still, they’re preferable to those British last summer who kept shouting about:‘Isn’t the sea blue? Isn’t the sky white? Isn’t little Nellie’s nose red?’ ”

Rosemary thought she would not like to have Nicole for an enemy.

“But you didn’t see the fight,” Nicole continued. “The day before you came, the married man, the one with the name that sounds like a substitute for gasoline or butter—”

“McKisco?”

“Yes—well they were having words and she tossed some sand in his face. So naturally he sat on top of her and rubbed her face in the sand. We were—electrified. I wanted Dick to interfere.”

“I think,” said Dick Diver, staring down abstractedly at the straw mat, “that I’ll go over and invite them to dinner.”

“No, you won’t,” Nicole told him quickly.

“I think it would be a very good thing. They’re here—let’s adjust ourselves.”

“We’re very well adjusted,” she insisted, laughing. “I’m not going to have my nose rubbed in the sand. I’m a mean, hard woman,” she explained to Rosemary, and then raising her voice, “Children, put on your bathing suits!”

Rosemary felt that this swim would become the typical one of her life, the one that would always pop up in her memory at the mention of swimming. Simultaneously the whole party moved toward the water, super-ready from the long, forced inaction, passing from the heat to the cool with the gourmandise of a tingling curry eaten with chilled white wine. The Divers’ day was spaced like the day of the older civilizations to yield the utmost from the materials at hand, and to give all the transitions their full value, and she did not know that there would be another transition presently from the utter absorption of the swim to the garrulity of the Provençal lunch hour. But again she had the sense that Dick was taking care of her, and she delighted in responding to the eventual movement as if it had been an order.

Nicole handed her husband the curious garment on which she had been working. He went into the dressing tent and inspired a commotion by appearing in a moment clad in transparent black lace drawers. Close inspection revealed that actually they were lined with flesh-colored cloth.

“Well, if that isn’t a pansy’s trick!” exclaimed Mr. McKisco contemptuously—then turning quickly to Mr. Dumphry and Mr. Campion, he added, “Oh, I beg your pardon.”

Rosemary bubbled with delight at the trunks. Her naïveté responded whole-heartedly to the expensive simplicity of the Divers, unaware of its complexity and its lack of innocence, unaware that it was all a selection of quality rather than quantity from the run of the world’s bazaar; and that the simplicity of behavior also, the nursery-like peace and good will, the emphasis on the simpler virtues, was part of a desperate bargain with the gods and had been attained through struggles she could not have guessed at. At that moment the Divers represented externally the exact furthermost evolution of a class, so that most people seemed awkward beside them—in reality a qualitative change had already set in that was not at all apparent to Rosemary.

She stood with them as they took sherry and ate crackers. Dick Diver looked at her with cold blue eyes; his kind, strong mouth said thoughtfully and deliberately:

“You’re the only girl I’ve seen for a long time that actually did look like something blooming.”

In her mother’s lap afterward Rosemary cried and cried.

“I love him, Mother. I’m desperately in love with him—I never knew I could feel that way about anybody. And he’s married and I like her too—it’s just hopeless. Oh, I love him so!”

“I’m curious to meet him.”

“She’s invited us to dinner Friday.”

“If you’re in love it ought to make you happy. You ought to laugh.”

Rosemary looked up and gave a beautiful little shiver of her face and laughed. Her mother always had a great influence on her.

Rosemary went to Monte Carlo nearly as sulkily as it was possible for her to be. She rode up the rugged hill to la Turbie, to an old Gaumont lot in process of reconstruction, and as she stood by the grilled entrance waiting for an answer to the message on her card, she might have been looking into Hollywood. The bizarre débris of some recent picture, a decayed street scene in India, a great cardboard whale, a monstrous tree bearing cherries large as basketballs, bloomed there by exotic dispensation, autochthonous as the pale amaranth, mimosa, cork oak or dwarf pine. There were a quick-lunch shack and two barnlike stages and everywhere about the lot, groups of waiting, hopeful, painted faces.

After ten minutes a young man with hair the color of canary feathers hurried down to the gate.

“Come in, Miss Hoyt. Mr. Brady’s on the set, but he’s very anxious to see you. I’m sorry you were kept waiting, but you know some of these French dames are worse about pushing themselves in—”

The studio manager opened a small door in the blank wall of stage building and with sudden glad familiarity Rosemary followed him into half darkness. Here and there figures spotted the twilight, turning up ashen faces to her like souls in purgatory watching the passage of a mortal through. There were whispers and soft voices and, apparently from afar, the gentle tremolo of a small organ. Turning the corner made by some flats, they came upon the white crackling glow of a stage, where a French actor—his shirt front, collar, and cuffs tinted a brilliant pink—and an American actress stood motionless face to face. They stared at each other with dogged eyes, as though they had been in the same position for hours; and still for a long time nothing happened, no one moved. A bank of lights went off with a savage hiss, went on again; the plaintive tap of a hammer begged admission to nowhere in the distance; a blue face appeared among the blinding lights above, called something unintelligible into the upper blackness. Then the silence was broken by a voice in front of Rosemary.

“Baby, you don’t take off the stockings, you can spoil ten more pairs. That dress is fifteen pounds.”

Stepping backward the speaker ran against Rosemary, whereupon the studio manager said, “Hey, Earl—Miss Hoyt.”

They were meeting for the first time. Brady was quick and strenuous. As he took her hand she saw him look her over from head to foot, a gesture she recognized and that made her feel at home, but gave her always a faint feeling of superiority to whoever made it. If her person was property she could exercise whatever advantage was inherent in its ownership.

“I thought you’d be along any day now,” Brady said, in a voice that was just a little too compelling for private life, and that trailed with it a faintly defiant cockney accent. “Have a good trip?”

“Yes, but we’re glad to be going home.”

“No-o-o!” he protested. “Stay awhile—I want to talk to you. Let me tell you that was some picture of yours—that ‘Daddy’s Girl.’ I saw it in Paris. I wired the coast right away to see if you were signed.”

“I just had—I’m sorry.”

“God, what a picture!”

Not wanting to smile in silly agreement Rosemary frowned.

“Nobody wants to be thought of forever for just one picture,” she said.

“Sure—that’s right. What’re your plans?”

“Mother thought I needed a rest. When I get back we’ll probably either sign up with First National or keep on with Famous.”

“Who’s we?”

“My mother. She decides business matters. I couldn’t do without her.”

Again he looked her over completely, and, as he did, something in Rosemary went out to him. It was not liking, not at all the spontaneous admiration she had felt for the man on the beach this morning. It was a click. He desired her and, so far as her virginal emotions went, she contemplated a surrender with equanimity. Yet she knew she would forget him half an hour after she left him—like an actor kissed in a picture.

“Where are you staying?” Brady asked. “Oh, yes, at Gausse’s. Well, my plans are made for this year, too, but that letter I wrote you still stands. Rather make a picture with you than any girl since Connie Talmadge was a kid.”

“I feel the same way. Why don’t you come back to Hollywood.”

“I can’t stand the damn place. I’m fine here. Wait till after this shot and I’ll show you around.”

Walking onto the set he began to talk to the French actor in a low, quiet voice.

Five minutes passed—Brady talked on, while from time to time the Frenchman shifted his feet and nodded. Abruptly, Brady broke off, calling something to the lights that startled them into a humming glare. Los Angeles was loud about Rosemary now. Unappalled she moved once more through the city of thin partitions, wanting to be back there. But she did not want to see Brady in the mood she sensed he would be in after he had finished and she left the lot with a spell still upon her. The Mediterranean world was less silent now that she knew the studio was there. She liked the people on the streets and bought herself a pair of espadrilles on the way to the train.

Her mother was pleased that she had done so accurately what she was told to do, but she still wanted to launch her out and away. Mrs. Speers was fresh in appearance but she was tired; death beds make people tired indeed and she had watched beside a couple.

Feeling good from the rosy wine at lunch, Nicole Diver folded her arms high enough for the artificial camellia on her shoulder to touch her cheek, and went out into her lovely grassless garden. The garden was bounded on one side by the house, from which it flowed and into which it ran, on two sides by the old village, and on the last by the cliff falling by ledges to the sea.

Along the walls on the village side all was dusty, the wriggling vines, the lemon and eucalyptus trees, the casual wheel-barrow, left only a moment since, but already grown into the path, atrophied and faintly rotten. Nicole was invariably somewhat surprised that by turning in the other direction past a bed of peonies she walked into an area so green and cool that the leaves and petals were curled with tender damp.

Knotted at her throat she wore a lilac scarf that even in the achromatic sunshine cast its color up to her face and down around her moving feet in a lilac shadow. Her face was hard, almost stern, save for the soft gleam of piteous doubt that looked from her green eyes. Her once fair hair had darkened, but she was lovelier now at twenty-four than she had been at eighteen, when her hair was brighter than she.

Following a walk marked by an intangible mist of bloom that followed the white border stones she came to a space overlooking the sea where there were lanterns asleep in the fig trees and a big table and wicker chairs and a great market umbrella from Siena, all gathered about an enormous pine, the biggest tree in the garden. She paused there a moment, looking absently at a growth of nasturtiums and iris tangled at its foot, as though sprung from a careless handful of seeds, listening to the plaints and accusations of some nursery squabble in the house. When this died away on the summer air, she walked on, between kaleidoscopic peonies massed in pink clouds, black and brown tulips and fragile mauve-stemmed roses, transparent like sugar flowers in a confectioner’s window—until, as if the scherzo of color could reach no further intensity, it broke off suddenly in mid-air, and moist steps went down to a level five feet below.

Here there was a well with the boarding around it dank and slippery even on the brightest days. She went up the stairs on the other side and into the vegetable garden; she walked rather quickly; she liked to be active, though at times she gave an impression of repose that was at once static and evocative. This was because she knew few words and believed in none, and in the world she was rather silent, contributing just her share of urbane humor with a precision that approached meagreness. But at the moment when strangers tended to grow uncomfortable in the presence of this economy she would seize the topic and rush off with it, feverishly surprised with herself—then bring it back and relinquish it abruptly, almost timidly, like an obedient retriever, having been adequate and something more.

As she stood in the fuzzy green light of the vegetable garden, Dick crossed the path ahead of her going to his work house. Nicole waited silently till he had passed; then she went on through lines of prospective salads to a little menagerie where pigeons and rabbits and a parrot made a medley of insolent noises at her. Descending to another ledge she reached a low, curved wall and looked down seven hundred feet to the Mediterranean Sea.

She stood in the ancient hill village of Tarmes. The villa and its grounds were made out of a row of peasant dwellings that abutted on the cliff—five small houses had been combined to make the house and four destroyed to make the garden. The exterior walls were untouched so that from the road far below it was indistinguishable from the violet gray mass of the town.

For a moment Nicole stood looking down at the Mediterranean but there was nothing to do with that, even with her tireless hands. Presently Dick came out of his one-room house carrying a telescope and looked east toward Cannes. In a moment Nicole swam into his field of vision, whereupon he disappeared into his house and came out with a megaphone. He had many light mechanical devices.

“Nicole,” he shouted, “I forgot to tell you that as a final apostolic gesture I invited Mrs. Abrams, the woman with the white hair.”

“I suspected it. It’s an outrage.”

The ease with which her reply reached him seemed to belittle his megaphone, so she raised her voice and called, “Can you hear me?”

“Yes.” He lowered the megaphone and then raised it stubbornly. “I’m going to invite some more people too. I’m going to invite the two young men.”

“All right,” she agreed placidly.

“I want to give a really bad party. I mean it. I want to give a party where there’s a brawl and seductions and people going home with their feelings hurt and women passed out in the cabinet de toilette. You wait and see.”

He went back into his house and Nicole saw that one of his most characteristic moods was upon him, the excitement that swept everyone up into it and was inevitably followed by his own form of melancholy, which he never displayed but at which she guessed. This excitement about things reached an intensity out of proportion to their importance, generating a really extraordinary virtuosity with people. Save among a few of the tough-minded and perennially suspicious, he had the power of arousing a fascinated and uncritical love. The reaction came when he realized the waste and extravagance involved. He sometimes looked back with awe at the carnivals of affection he had given as a general might gaze upon a massacre he had ordered to satisfy an impersonal blood lust.

But to be included in Dick Diver’s world for a while was a remarkable experience: people believed he made special reservations about them, recognizing the proud uniqueness of their destinies, buried under the compromises of how many years. He won everyone quickly with an exquisite consideration and a politeness that moved so fast and intuitively that it could be examined only in its effect. Then, without caution, lest the first bloom of the relation wither, he opened the gate to his amusing world. So long as they subscribed to it completely, their happiness was his preoccupation, but at the first flicker of doubt as to its all-inclusiveness he evaporated before their eyes, leaving little communicable memory of what he had said or done.

At eight-thirty that evening he came out to meet his first guests, his coat carried rather ceremoniously, rather promisingly, in his hand, like a toreador’s cape. It was characteristic that after greeting Rosemary and her mother he waited for them to speak first, as if to allow them the reassurance of their own voices in new surroundings.

To resume Rosemary’s point of view it should be said that, under the spell of the climb to Tarmes and the fresher air, she and her mother looked about appreciatively. Just as the personal qualities of extraordinary people can make themselves plain in an unaccustomed change of expression, so the intensely calculated perfection of Villa Diana transpired all at once through such minute failures as the chance apparition of a maid in the background or the perversity of a cork. While the first guests arrived bringing with them the excitement of the night, the domestic activity of the day receded past them gently, symbolized by the Diver children and their governess still at supper on the terrace.

“What a beautiful garden!” Mrs. Speers exclaimed.

“Nicole’s garden,” said Dick. “She won’t let it alone—she nags it all the time, worries about its diseases. Any day now I expect to have her come down with Powdery Mildew or Fly Speck, or Late Blight.” He pointed his forefinger decisively at Rosemary, saying with a lightness seeming to conceal a paternal interest, “I’m going to save your reason—I’m going to give you a hat to wear on the beach.”

He turned them from the garden to the terrace, where he poured a cocktail. Earl Brady arrived, discovering Rosemary with surprise. His manner was softer than at the studio, as if his differentness had been put on at the gate, and Rosemary, comparing him instantly with Dick Diver, swung sharply toward the latter. In comparison Earl Brady seemed faintly gross, faintly ill-bred; once more, though, she felt an electric response to his person.

He spoke familiarly to the children who were getting up from their outdoor supper.

“Hello, Lanier, how about a song? Will you and Topsy sing me a song?”

“What shall we sing?” agreed the little boy, with the odd chanting accent of American children brought up in France.

“That song about ‘Mon Ami Pierrot.’ ”

Brother and sister stood side by side without self-consciousness and their voices soared sweet and shrill upon the evening air.

Au clair de la lune

　 Mon Ami Pierrot

Prête-moi ta plume

　 Pour écrire un mot

Ma chandelle est morte

　 Je n’ai plus de feu

Ouvre-moi ta porte

　 Pour l’amour de Dieu.

The singing ceased and the children, their faces aglow with the late sunshine, stood smiling calmly at their success. Rosemary was thinking that the Villa Diana was the centre of the world. On such a stage some memorable thing was sure to happen. She lighted up higher as the gate tinkled open and the rest of the guests arrived in a body—the McKiscos, Mrs. Abrams, Mr. Dumphry, and Mr. Campion came up to the terrace.

Rosemary had a sharp feeling of disappointment—she looked quickly at Dick, as though to ask an explanation of this incongruous mingling. But there was nothing unusual in his expression. He greeted his new guests with a proud bearing and an obvious deference to their infinite and unknown possibilities. She believed in him so much that presently she accepted the rightness of the McKiscos’ presence as if she had expected to meet them all along.

“I’ve met you in Paris,” McKisco said to Abe North, who with his wife had arrived on their heels, “in fact I’ve met you twice.”

“Yes, I remember,” Abe said.

“Then where was it?” demanded McKisco, not content to let well enough alone.

“Why, I think—” Abe got tired of the game, “I can’t remember.”

The interchange filled a pause and Rosemary’s instinct was that something tactful should be said by somebody, but Dick made no attempt to break up the grouping formed by these late arrivals, not even to disarm Mrs. McKisco of her air of supercilious amusement. He did not solve this social problem because he knew it was not of importance at the moment and would solve itself. He was saving his newness for a larger effort, waiting a more significant moment for his guests to be conscious of a good time.

Rosemary stood beside Tommy Barban—he was in a particularly scornful mood and there seemed to be some special stimulus working upon him. He was leaving in the morning.

“Going home?”

“Home? I have no home. I am going to a war.”

“What war?”

“What war? Any war. I haven’t seen a paper lately but I suppose there’s a war—there always is.”

“Don’t you care what you fight for?”

“Not at all—so long as I’m well treated. When I’m in a rut I come to see the Divers, because then I know that in a few weeks I’ll want to go to war.”

Rosemary stiffened.

“You like the Divers,” she reminded him.

“Of course—especially her—but they make me want to go to war.”

She considered this, to no avail. The Divers made her want to stay near them forever.

“You’re half American,” she said, as if that should solve the problem.

“Also I’m half French, and I was educated in England and since I was eighteen I’ve worn the uniforms of eight countries. But I hope I did not give you the impression that I am not fond of the Divers—I am, especially of Nicole.”

“How could any one help it?” she said simply.

She felt far from him. The undertone of his words repelled her and she withdrew her adoration for the Divers from the profanity of his bitterness. She was glad he was not next to her at dinner and she was still thinking of his words “especially her” as they moved toward the table in the garden.

For a moment now she was beside Dick Diver on the path. Alongside his hard, neat brightness everything faded into the surety that he knew everything. For a year, which was forever, she had had money and a certain celebrity and contact with the celebrated, and these latter had presented themselves merely as powerful enlargements of the people with whom the doctor’s widow and her daughter had associated in a hôtel-pension in Paris. Rosemary was a romantic and her career had not provided many satisfactory opportunities on that score. Her mother, with the idea of a career for Rosemary, would not tolerate any such spurious substitutes as the excitations available on all sides, and indeed Rosemary was already beyond that—she was In the movies but not at all At them. So when she had seen approval of Dick Diver in her mother’s face it meant that he was “the real thing;” it meant permission to go as far as she could.

“I was watching you,” he said, and she knew he meant it. “We’ve grown very fond of you.”

“I fell in love with you the first time I saw you,” she said quietly.

He pretended not to have heard, as if the compliment were purely formal.

“New friends,” he said, as if it were an important point, “can often have a better time together than old friends.”

With that remark, which she did not understand precisely, she found herself at the table, picked out by slowly emerging lights against the dark dusk. A chord of delight struck inside her when she saw that Dick had taken her mother on his right hand; for herself she was between Luis Campion and Brady.

Surcharged with her emotion she turned to Brady with the intention of confiding in him, but at her first mention of Dick a hard-boiled sparkle in his eyes gave her to understand that he refused the fatherly office. In turn she was equally firm when he tried to monopolize her hand, so they talked shop or rather she listened while he talked shop, her polite eyes never leaving his face, but her mind was so definitely elsewhere that she felt he must guess the fact. Intermittently she caught the gist of his sentences and supplied the rest from her subconscious, as one picks up the striking of a clock in the middle with only the rhythm of the first uncounted strokes lingering in the mind.

In a pause Rosemary looked away and up the table where Nicole sat between Tommy Barban and Abe North, her chow’s hair foaming and frothing in the candlelight. Rosemary listened, caught sharply by the rich clipped voice in infrequent speech:

“The poor man,” Nicole exclaimed. “Why did you want to saw him in two?”

“Naturally I wanted to see what was inside a waiter. Wouldn’t you like to know what was inside a waiter?”

“Old menus,” suggested Nicole with a short laugh. “Pieces of broken china and tips and pencil stubs.”

“Exactly—but the thing was to prove it scientifically. And of course doing it with that musical saw would have eliminated any sordidness.”

“Did you intend to play the saw while you performed the operation?” Tommy inquired.

“We didn’t get quite that far. We were alarmed by the screams. We thought he might rupture something.”

“All sounds very peculiar to me,” said Nicole. “Any musician that’ll use another musician’s saw to—”

They had been at table half an hour and a perceptible change had set in—person by person had given up something, a preoccupation, an anxiety, a suspicion, and now they were only their best selves and the Divers’ guests. Not to have been friendly and interested would have seemed to reflect on the Divers, so now they were all trying, and seeing this, Rosemary liked everyone—except McKisco, who had contrived to be the unassimilated member of the party. This was less from ill will than from his determination to sustain with wine the good spirits he had enjoyed on his arrival. Lying back in his place between Earl Brady, to whom he had addressed several withering remarks about the movies, and Mrs. Abrams, to whom he said nothing, he stared at Dick Diver with an expression of devastating irony, the effect being occasionally interrupted by his attempts to engage Dick in a catercornered conversation across the table.

“Aren’t you a friend of Van Buren Denby?” he would say.

“I don’t believe I know him.”

“I thought you were a friend of his,” he persisted irritably.

When the subject of Mr. Denby fell of its own weight, he essayed other equally irrelative themes, but each time the very deference of Dick’s attention seemed to paralyze him, and after a moment’s stark pause the conversation that he had interrupted would go on without him. He tried breaking into other dialogues, but it was like continually shaking hands with a glove from which the hand had been withdrawn—so finally, with a resigned air of being among children, he devoted his attention entirely to the champagne.

Rosemary’s glance moved at intervals around the table, eager for the others’ enjoyment, as if they were her future stepchildren. A gracious table light, emanating from a bowl of spicy pinks, fell upon Mrs. Abrams’ face, cooked to a turn in Veuve Cliquot, full of vigor, tolerance, adolescent good will; next to her sat Mr. Royal Dumphry, his girl’s comeliness less startling in the pleasure world of evening. Then Violet McKisco, whose prettiness had been piped to the surface of her, so that she ceased her struggle to make tangible to herself her shadowy position as the wife of an arriviste who had not arrived.

Then came Dick, with his arms full of the slack he had taken up from others, deeply merged in his own party.

Then her mother, forever perfect.

Then Barban talking to her mother with an urbane fluency that made Rosemary like him again. Then Nicole. Rosemary saw her suddenly in a new way and found her one of the most beautiful people she had ever known. Her face, the face of a saint, a Viking madonna, shone through the faint motes that snowed across the candlelight, drew down its flush from the wine-colored lanterns in the pine. She was still as still.

Abe North was talking to her about his moral code:“Of course I’ve got one,” he insisted, “—a man can’t live without a moral code. Mine is that I’m against the burning of witches. Whenever they burn a witch I get all hot under the collar.” Rosemary knew from Brady that he was a musician who after a brilliant and precocious start had composed nothing for seven years.

Next was Campion, managing somehow to restrain his most blatant effeminacy, and even to visit upon those near him a certain disinterested motherliness. Then Mary North with a face so merry that it was impossible not to smile back into the white mirrors of her teeth—the whole area around her parted lips was a lovely little circle of delight.

Finally Brady, whose heartiness became, moment by moment, a social thing instead of a crude assertion and reassertion of his own mental health, and his preservation of it by a detachment from the frailties of others.

Rosemary, as dewy with belief as a child from one of Mrs. Burnett’s vicious tracts, had a conviction of homecoming, of a return from the derisive and salacious improvisations of the frontier. There were fireflies riding on the dark air and a dog baying on some low and far-away ledge of the cliff. The table seemed to have risen a little toward the sky like a mechanical dancing platform, giving the people around it a sense of being alone with each other in the dark universe, nourished by its only food, warmed by its only lights. And, as if a curious hushed laugh from Mrs. McKisco were a signal that such a detachment from the world had been attained, the two Divers began suddenly to warm and glow and expand, as if to make up to their guests, already so subtly assured of their importance, so flattered with politeness, for anything they might still miss from that country well left behind. Just for a moment they seemed to speak to every one at the table, singly and together, assuring them of their friendliness, their affection. And for a moment the faces turned up toward them were like the faces of poor children at a Christmas tree. Then abruptly the table broke up—the moment when the guests had been daringly lifted above conviviality into the rarer atmosphere of sentiment was over before it could be irreverently breathed, before they had half realized it was there.

But the diffused magic of the hot sweet South had withdrawn into them—the soft-pawed night and the ghostly wash of the Mediterranean far below—the magic left these things and melted into the two Divers and became part of them. Rosemary watched Nicole pressing upon her mother a yellow evening bag she had admired, saying, “I think things ought to belong to the people that like them”—and then sweeping into it all the yellow articles she could find, a pencil, a lipstick, a little note book,“because they all go together.”

Nicole disappeared and presently Rosemary noticed that Dick was no longer there; the guests distributed themselves in the garden or drifted in toward the terrace.

“Do you want,” Violet McKisco asked Rosemary, “to go to the bathroom?”

Not at that precise moment.

“I want,” insisted Mrs. McKisco, “to go to the bathroom.” As a frank outspoken woman she walked toward the house, dragging her secret after her, while Rosemary looked after with reprobation. Earl Brady proposed that they walk down to the sea wall but she felt that this was her time to have a share of Dick Diver when he reappeared, so she stalled, listening to McKisco quarrel with Barban.

“Why do you want to fight the Soviets?” McKisco said. “The greatest experiment ever made by humanity? And the Riff? It seems to me it would be more heroic to fight on the just side.”

“How do you find out which it is?” asked Barban dryly.

“Why—usually everybody intelligent knows.”

“Are you a Communist?”

“I’m a Socialist,” said McKisco, “I sympathize with Russia.”

“Well, I’m a soldier,” Barban answered pleasantly. “My business is to kill people. I fought against the Riff because I am a European, and I have fought the Communists because they want to take my property from me.”

“Of all the narrow-minded excuses,” McKisco looked around to establish a derisive liaison with some one else, but without success. He had no idea what he was up against in Barban, neither of the simplicity of the other man’s bag of ideas nor of the complexity of his training. McKisco knew what ideas were, and as his mind grew he was able to recognize and sort an increasing number of them—but faced by a man whom he considered “dumb,” one in whom he found no ideas he could recognize as such, and yet to whom he could not feel personally superior, he jumped at the conclusion that Barban was the end product of an archaic world, and as such, worthless. McKisco’s contacts with the princely classes in America had impressed upon him their uncertain and fumbling snobbery, their delight in ignorance and their deliberate rudeness, all lifted from the English with no regard paid to factors that make English philistinism and rudeness purposeful, and applied in a land where a little knowledge and civility buy more than they do anywhere else—an attitude which reached its apogee in the “Harvard manner” of about 1900. He thought that this Barban was of that type, and being drunk rashly forgot that he was in awe of him—this led up to the trouble in which he presently found himself.

Feeling vaguely ashamed for McKisco, Rosemary waited, placid but inwardly on fire, for Dick Diver’s return. From her chair at the deserted table with Barban, McKisco, and Abe she looked up along the path edged with shadowy myrtle and fern to the stone terrace, and falling in love with her mother’s profile against a lighted door, was about to go there when Mrs. McKisco came hurrying down from the house.

She exuded excitement. In the very silence with which she pulled out a chair and sat down, her eyes staring, her mouth working a little, they all recognized a person crop-full of news, and her husband’s “What’s the matter, Vi?” came naturally, as all eyes turned toward her.

“My dear—” she said at large, and then addressed Rosemary, “my dear—it’s nothing. I really can’t say a word.”

“You’re among friends,” said Abe.

“Well, upstairs I came upon a scene, my dears—”

Shaking her head cryptically she broke off just in time, for Tommy arose and addressed her politely but sharply:

“It’s inadvisable to comment on what goes on in this house.”

Violet breathed loud and hard once and with an effort brought another expression into her face.

Dick came finally and with a sure instinct he separated Barban and the McKiscos and became excessively ignorant and inquisitive about literature with McKisco—thus giving the latter the moment of superiority which he required. The others helped him carry lamps up—who would not be pleased at carrying lamps helpfully through the darkness? Rosemary helped, meanwhile responding patiently to Royal Dumphry’s inexhaustible curiosity about Hollywood.

Now—she was thinking—I’ve earned a time alone with him. He must know that because his laws are like the laws Mother taught me.

Rosemary was right—presently he detached her from the company on the terrace, and they were alone together, borne away from the house toward the seaside wall with what were less steps than irregularly spaced intervals through some of which she was pulled, through others blown.

They looked out over the Mediterranean. Far below, the last excursion boat from the Iles de Lérins floated across the bay like a Fourth-of-July balloon foot-loose in the heavens. Between the black isles it floated, softly parting the dark tide.

“I understand why you speak as you do of your mother,” he said. “Her attitude toward you is very fine, I think. She has a sort of wisdom that’s rare in America.”

“Mother is perfect,” she prayed.

“I was talking to her about a plan I have—she told me that how long you both stayed in France depended on you.”

On you, Rosemary all but said aloud.

“So since things are over down here—”

“Over?” she inquired.

“Well, this is over—this part of the summer is over. Last week Nicole’s sister left, to-morrow Tommy Barban leaves, Monday Abe and Mary North are leaving. Maybe we’ll have more fun this summer but this particular fun is over. I want it to die violently instead of fading out sentimentally—that’s why I gave this party. What I’m coming to is—Nicole and I are going up to Paris to see Abe North off for America—I wonder if you’d like to go with us.”

“What did Mother say?”

“She seemed to think it would be fine. She doesn’t want to go herself. She wants you to go alone.”

“I haven’t seen Paris since I’ve been grown,” said Rosemary. “I’d love to see it with you.”

“That’s nice of you.” Did she imagine that his voice was suddenly metallic? “Of course we’ve been excited about you from the moment you came on the beach. That vitality, we were sure it was professional—especially Nicole was. It’d never use itself up on any one person or group.”

Her instinct cried out to her that he was passing her along slowly toward Nicole and she put her own brakes on, saying with an equal harness:

“I wanted to know all of you too—especially you. I told you I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.”

She was right going at it that way. But the space between heaven and earth had cooled his mind, destroyed the impulsiveness that had led him to bring her here, and made him aware of the too obvious appeal, the struggle with an unrehearsed scene and unfamiliar words.

He tried now to make her want to go back to the house and it was difficult, and he did not quite want to lose her. She felt only the draft blowing as he joked with her good-humoredly.

“You don’t know what you want. You go and ask your mother what you want.”

She was stricken. She touched him, feeling the smooth cloth of his dark coat like a chasuble. She seemed about to fall to her knees—from that position she delivered her last shot.

“I think you’re the most wonderful person I ever met—except my mother.”

“You have romantic eyes.”

His laughter swept them on up toward the terrace where he delivered her to Nicole….

Too soon it had become time to go and the Divers helped them all to go quickly. In the Divers’ big Isotta there would be Tommy Barban and his baggage—he was spending the night at the hotel to catch an early train—with Mrs. Abrams, the McKiscos and Campion. Earl Brady was going to drop Rosemary and her mother on his way to Monte Carlo, and Royal Dumphry rode with them because the Divers’ car was crowded. Down in the garden lanterns still glowed over the table where they had dined, as the Divers stood side by side in the gate, Nicole blooming away and filling the night with graciousness, and Dick bidding good-by to everyone by name. To Rosemary it seemed very poignant to drive away and leave them in their house. Again she wondered what Mrs. McKisco had seen in the bathroom.

It was a limpid black night, hung as in a basket from a single dull star. The horn of the car ahead was muffled by the resistance of the thick air. Brady’s chauffeur drove slowly; the tail-light of the other car appeared from time to time at turnings—then not at all. But after ten minutes it came into sight again, drawn up at the side of the road. Brady’s chauffeur slowed up behind but immediately it began to roll forward slowly and they passed it. In the instant they passed it they heard a blur of voices from behind the reticence of the limousine and saw that the Divers’ chauffeur was grinning. Then they went on, going fast through the alternating banks of darkness and thin night, descending at last in a series of roller-coaster swoops, to the great bulk of Gausse’s Hôtel.

Rosemary dozed for three hours and then lay awake, suspended in the moonshine. Cloaked by the erotic darkness she exhausted the future quickly, with all the eventualities that might lead up to a kiss, but with the kiss itself as blurred as a kiss in pictures. She changed position in bed deliberately, the first sign of insomnia she had ever had, and tried to think with her mother’s mind about the question. In this process she was often acute beyond her experience, with remembered things from old conversations that had gone into her half-heard.

Rosemary had been brought up with the idea of work. Mrs. Speers had spent the slim leavings of the men who had widowed her on her daughter’s education, and when she blossomed out at sixteen with that extraordinary hair, rushed her to Aix-les-Bains and marched her unannounced into the suite of an American producer who was recuperating there. When the producer went to New York they went too. Thus Rosemary had passed her entrance examinations. With the ensuing success and the promise of comparative stability that followed, Mrs. Speers had felt free to tacitly imply tonight:

“You were brought up to work—not especially to marry. Now you’ve found your first nut to crack and it’s a good nut—go ahead and put whatever happens down to experience. Wound yourself or him—whatever happens it can’t spoil you because economically you’re a boy, not a girl.”

Rosemary had never done much thinking, save about the illimitability of her mother’s perfections, so this final severance of the umbilical cord disturbed her sleep. A false dawn sent the sky pressing through the tall French windows, and getting up she walked out on the terrace, warm to her bare feet. There were secret noises in the air, an insistent bird achieved an ill-natured triumph with regularity in the trees above the tennis court; footfalls followed a round drive in the rear of the hotel, taking their tone in turn from the dust road, the crushed-stone walk, the cement steps, and then reversing the process in going away. Beyond the inky sea and far up that high, black shadow of a hill lived the Divers. She thought of them both together, heard them still singing faintly a song like rising smoke, like a hymn, very remote in time and far away. Their children slept, their gate was shut for the night.

She went inside and dressing in a light gown and espadrilles went out her window again and along the continuous terrace toward the front door, going fast since she found that other private rooms, exuding sleep, gave upon it. She stopped at the sight of a figure seated on the wide white stairway of the formal entrance—then she saw that it was Luis Campion and that he was weeping.

He was weeping hard and quietly and shaking in the same parts as a weeping woman. A scene in a rôle she had played last year swept over her irresistibly and advancing she touched him on the shoulder. He gave a little yelp before he recognized her.

“What is it?” Her eyes were level and kind and not slanted into him with hard curiosity. “Can I help you?”

“Nobody can help me. I knew it. I have only myself to blame. It’s always the same.”

“What is it—do you want to tell me?”

He looked at her to see.

“No,” he decided. “When you’re older you’ll know what people who love suffer. The agony. It’s better to be cold and young than to love. It’s happened to me before but never like this—so accidental—just when everything was going well.”

His face was repulsive in the quickening light. Not by a flicker of her personality, a movement of the smallest muscle, did she betray her sudden disgust with whatever it was. But Campion’s sensitivity realized it and he changed the subject rather suddenly.

“Abe North is around here somewhere.”

“Why, he’s staying at the Divers’!”

“Yes, but he’s up—don’t you know what happened?”

A shutter opened suddenly in a room two stories above and an English voice spat distinctly:

“Will you kaindlay stup tucking!”

Rosemary and Luis Campion went humbly down the steps and to a bench beside the road to the beach.

“Then you have no idea what’s happened? My dear, the most extraordinary thing—” He was warming up now, hanging on to his revelation. “I’ve never seen a thing come so suddenly—I have always avoided violent people—they upset me so I sometimes have to go to bed for days.”

He looked at her triumphantly. She had no idea what he was talking about.

“My dear,” he burst forth, leaning toward her with his whole body as he touched her on the upper leg, to show it was no mere irresponsible venture of his hand—he was so sure of himself. “There’s going to be a duel.”

“Wh-at?”

“A duel with—we don’t know what yet.”

“Who’s going to duel?”

“I’ll tell you from the beginning.” He drew a long breath and then said, as if it were rather to her discredit but he wouldn’t hold it against her.“Of course, you were in the other automobile. Well, in a way you were lucky—I lost at least two years of my life, it came so suddenly.”

“What came?” she demanded.

“I don’t know what began it. First she began to talk—”

“Who?”

“Violet McKisco.” He lowered his voice as if there were people under the bench. “But don’t mention the Divers because he made threats against anybody who mentioned it.”

“Who did?”

“Tommy Barban, so don’t you say I so much as mentioned them. None of us ever found out anyhow what it was Violet had to say because he kept interrupting her, and then her husband got into it and now, my dear, we have the duel. This morning—at five o’clock—in an hour.” He sighed suddenly thinking of his own griefs. “I almost wish it were I. I might as well be killed now I have nothing to live for.” He broke off and rocked to and fro with sorrow.

Again the iron shutter parted above and the same British voice said:

“Rilly, this must stup immejetely.”

Simultaneously Abe North, looking somewhat distracted, came out of the hotel, perceived them against the sky, white over the sea. Rosemary shook her head warningly before he could speak and they moved another bench further down the road. Rosemary saw that Abe was a little tight.

“What are you doing up?” he demanded.

“I just got up.” She started to laugh, but remembering the voice above, she restrained herself.

“Plagued by the nightingale,” Abe suggested, and repeated, “probably plagued by the nightingale. Has this sewing-circle member told you what happened?”

Campion said with dignity:

“I only know what I heard with my own ears.”

He got up and walked swiftly away; Abe sat down beside Rosemary.

“Why did you treat him so badly?”

“Did I?” he asked surprised. “He’s been weeping around here all morning.”

“Well, maybe he’s sad about something.”

“Maybe he is.”

“What about a duel? Who’s going to duel? I thought there was something strange in that car. Is it true?”

“It certainly is coo-coo but it seems to be true.”

The trouble began at the time Earl Brady’s car passed the Divers’ car stopped on the road—Abe’s account melted impersonally into the thronged night—Violet McKisco was telling Mrs. Abrams something she had found out about the Divers—she had gone upstairs in their house and she had come upon something there which had made a great impression on her. But Tommy is a watch-dog about the Divers. As a matter of fact she is inspiring and formidable—but it’s a mutual thing, and the fact of The Divers together is more important to their friends than many of them realize. Of course it’s done at a certain sacrifice—sometimes they seem just rather charming figures in a ballet, and worth just the attention you give a ballet, but it’s more than that—you’d have to know the story. Anyhow Tommy is one of those men that Dick’s passed along to Nicole and when Mrs. McKisco kept hinting at her story, he called them on it. He said:

“Mrs. McKisco, please don’t talk further about Mrs. Diver.”

“I wasn’t talking to you,” she objected.

“I think it’s better to leave them out.”

“Are they so sacred?”

“Leave them out. Talk about something else.”

He was sitting on one of the two little seats beside Campion. Campion told me the story.

“Well, you’re pretty high-handed,” Violet came back.

You know how conversations are in cars late at night, some people murmuring and some not caring, giving up after the party, or bored or asleep. Well, none of them knew just what happened until the car stopped and Barban cried in a voice that shook everybody, a voice for cavalry.

“Do you want to step out here—we’re only a mile from the hotel and you can walk it or I’ll drag you there. You’ve got to shut up and shut your wife up!”

“You’re a bully,” said McKisco. “You know you’re stronger muscularly than I am. But I’m not afraid of you—what they ought to have is the code duello—”

There’s where he made his mistake because Tommy, being French, leaned over and clapped him one, and then the chauffeur drove on. That was where you passed them. Then the women began. That was still the state of things when the car got to the hotel.

Tommy telephoned some man in Cannes to act as second and McKisco said he wasn’t going to be seconded by Campion, who wasn’t crazy for the job anyhow, so he telephoned me not to say anything but to come right down. Violet McKisco collapsed and Mrs. Abrams took her to her room and gave her a bromide whereupon she fell comfortably asleep on the bed. When I got there I tried to argue with Tommy but the latter wouldn’t accept anything short of an apology and McKisco rather spunkily wouldn’t give it.

When Abe had finished Rosemary asked thoughtfully:

“Do the Divers know it was about them?”

“No—and they’re not ever going to know they had anything to do with it. That damn Campion had no business talking to you about it, but since he did—I told the chauffeur I’d get out the old musical saw if he opened his mouth about it. This fight’s between two men—what Tommy needs is a good war.”

“I hope the Divers don’t find out,” Rosemary said.

Abe peered at his watch.

“I’ve got to go up and see McKisco—do you want to come?—he feels sort of friendless—I bet he hasn’t slept.”

Rosemary had a vision of the desperate vigil that high-strung, badly organized man had probably kept. After a moment balanced between pity and repugnance she agreed, and full of morning energy, bounced upstairs beside Abe.

McKisco was sitting on his bed with his alcoholic combativeness vanished, in spite of the glass of champagne in his hand. He seemed very puny and cross and white. Evidently he had been writing and drinking all night. He stared confusedly at Abe and Rosemary and asked:

“Is it time?”

“No, not for half an hour.”

The table was covered with papers which he assembled with some difficulty into a long letter; the writing on the last pages was very large and illegible. In the delicate light of electric lamps fading, he scrawled his name at the bottom, crammed it into an envelope and handed it to Abe. “For my wife.”

“You better souse your head in cold water,” Abe suggested.

“You think I’d better?” inquired McKisco doubtfully. “I don’t want to get too sober.”

“Well, you look terrible now.”

Obediently McKisco went into the bathroom.

“I’m leaving everything in an awful mess,” he called. “I don’t know how Violet will get back to America. I don’t carry any insurance. I never got around to it.”

“Don’t talk nonsense, you’ll be right here eating breakfast in an hour.”

“Sure, I know.” He came back with his hair wet and looked at Rosemary as if he saw her for the first time. Suddenly tears stood in his eyes. “I never have finished my novel. That’s what makes me so sore. You don’t like me,” he said to Rosemary, “but that can’t be helped. I’m primarily a literary man.” He made a vague discouraged sound and shook his head helplessly. “I’ve made lots of mistakes in my life—many of them. But I’ve been one of the most prominent—in some ways—”

He gave this up and puffed at a dead cigarette.

“I do like you,” said Rosemary, “but I don’t think you ought to fight a duel.”

“Yeah, I should have tried to beat him up, but it’s done now. I’ve let myself be drawn into something that I had no right to be. I have a very violent temper—” He looked closely at Abe as if he expected the statement to be challenged. Then with an aghast laugh he raised the cold cigarette butt toward his mouth. His breathing quickened.

“The trouble was I suggested the duel—if Violet had only kept her mouth shut I could have fixed it. Of course even now I can just leave, or sit back and laugh at the whole thing—but I don’t think Violet would ever respect me again.”

“Yes, she would,” said Rosemary. “She’d respect you more.”

“No—you don’t know Violet. She’s very hard when she gets an advantage over you. We’ve been married twelve years, we had a little girl seven years old and she died and after that you know how it is. We both played around on the side a little, nothing serious but drifting apart—she called me a coward out there tonight.”

Troubled, Rosemary didn’t answer.

“Well, we’ll see there’s as little damage done as possible,”said Abe. He opened the leather case. “These are Barban’s duelling pistols—I borrowed them so you could get familiar with them. He carries them in his suitcase.” He weighed one of the archaic weapons in his hand. Rosemary gave an exclamation of uneasiness and McKisco looked at the pistols anxiously.

“Well—it isn’t as if we were going to stand up and pot each other with forty-fives,” he said.

“I don’t know,” said Abe cruelly;“the idea is you can sight better along a long barrel.”

“How about distance?” asked McKisco.

“I’ve inquired about that. If one or the other parties has to be definitely eliminated they make it eight paces, if they’re just good and sore it’s twenty paces, and if it’s only to vindicate their honor it’s forty paces. His second agreed with me to make it forty.”

“That’s good.”

“There’s a wonderful duel in a novel of Pushkin’s,” recollected Abe.“Each man stood on the edge of a precipice, so if he was hit at all he was done for.”

This seemed very remote and academic to McKisco, who stared at him and said, “What?”

“Do you want to take a quick dip and freshen up?”

“No—no, I couldn t swim.” He sighed. “I don’t see what it’s all about,” he said helplessly. “I don’t see why I’m doing it.”

It was the first thing he had ever done in his life. Actually he was one of those for whom the sensual world does not exist, and faced with a concrete fact he brought to it a vast surprise.

“We might as well be going,” said Abe, seeing him fail a little.

“All right.” He drank off a stiff drink of brandy, put the flask in his pocket, and said with almost a savage air:“What’ll happen if I kill him—will they throw me in jail?”

“I’ll run you over the Italian border.”

He glanced at Rosemary—and then said apologetically to Abe:

“Before we start there’s one thing I’d like to see you about alone.”

“I hope neither of you gets hurt,” Rosemary said. “I think it’s very foolish and you ought to try to stop it.”





11


She found Campion downstairs in the deserted lobby.

“I saw you go upstairs,” he said excitedly. “Is he all right? When is the duel going to be?”

“I don’t know.” She resented his speaking of it as a circus, with McKisco as the tragic clown.

“Will you go with me?” he demanded, with the air of having seats.“I’ve hired the hotel car.”

“I don’t want to go.”

“Why not? I imagine it’ll take years off my life but I wouldn’t miss it for worlds. We could watch it from quite far away.”

“Why don’t you get Mr. Dumphry to go with you?”

His monocle fell out, with no whiskers to hide in—he drew himself up.

“I never want to see him again.”

“Well, I’m afraid I can’t go. Mother wouldn’t like it.”

As Rosemary entered her room Mrs. Speers stirred sleepily and called to her:

“Where’ve you been?”

“I just couldn’t sleep. You go back to sleep, Mother.”

“Come in my room.” Hearing her sit up in bed, Rosemary went in and told her what had happened.

“Why don’t you go and see it?” Mrs. Speers suggested. “You needn’t go up close and you might be able to help afterwards.”

Rosemary did not like the picture of herself looking on and she demurred, but Mrs. Speer’s consciousness was still clogged with sleep and she was reminded of night calls to death and calamity when she was the wife of a doctor. “I like you to go places and do things on your own initiative without me—you did much harder things for Rainy’s publicity stunts.”

Still Rosemary did not see why she should go, but she obeyed the sure, clear voice that had sent her into the stage entrance of the Odéon in Paris when she was twelve and greeted her when she came out again.

She thought she was reprieved when from the steps she saw Abe and McKisco drive away—but after a moment the hotel car came around the corner. Squealing delightedly Luis Campion pulled her in beside him.

“I hid there because they might not let us come. I’ve got my movie camera, you see.”

She laughed helplessly. He was so terrible that he was no longer terrible, only dehumanized.

“I wonder why Mrs. McKisco didn’t like the Divers?” she said. “They were very nice to her.”

“Oh, it wasn’t that. It was something she saw. We never did find exactly what it was because of Barban.”

“Then that wasn’t what made you so sad.”

“Oh, no,” he said, his voice breaking, “that was something else that happened when we got back to the hotel. But now I don’t care—I wash my hands of it completely.”

They followed the other car east along the shore past Juan-les-Pins, where the skeleton of the new Casino was rising. It was past four and under a blue-gray sky the first fishing boats were creaking out into a glaucous sea. Then they turned off the main road and into the back country.

“It’s the golf course,” cried Campion, “I’m sure that’s where it’s going to be.”

He was right. When Abe’s car pulled up ahead of them the east was crayoned red and yellow, promising a sultry day. Ordering the hotel car into a grove of pines Rosemary and Campion kept in the shadow of a wood and skirted the bleached fairway where Abe and McKisco were walking up and down, the latter raising his head at intervals like a rabbit scenting. Presently there were moving figures over by a farther tee and the watchers made out Barban and his French second—the latter carried the box of pistols under his arm.

Somewhat appalled, McKisco slipped behind Abe and took a long swallow of brandy. He walked on choking and would have marched directly up into the other party, but Abe stopped him and went forward to talk to the Frenchman. The sun was over the horizon.

Campion grabbed Rosemary’s arm.

“I can’t stand it,” he squeaked, almost voiceless. “It’s too much. This will cost me—”

“Let go,” Rosemary said peremptorily. She breathed a frantic prayer in French.

The principals faced each other, Barban with the sleeve rolled up from his arm. His eyes gleamed restlessly in the sun, but his motion was deliberate as he wiped his palm on the seam of his trousers. McKisco, reckless with brandy, pursed his lips in a whistle and pointed his long nose about nonchalantly, until Abe stepped forward with a handkerchief in his hand. The French second stood with his face turned away. Rosemary caught her breath in terrible pity and gritted her teeth with hatred for Barban; then:

“One—two—three!” Abe counted in a strained voice.

They fired at the same moment. McKisco swayed but recovered himself. Both shots had missed.

“Now, that’s enough!” cried Abe.

The duellists walked in, and everyone looked at Barban inquiringly.

“I declare myself unsatisfied.”

“What? Sure you’re satisfied,” said Abe impatiently. “You just don’t know it.”

“Your man refuses another shot?”

“You’re damn right, Tommy. You insisted on this and my client went through with it.”

Tommy laughed scornfully.

“The distance was ridiculous,” he said. “I’m not accustomed to such farces—your man must remember he’s not now in America.”

“No use cracking at America,” said Abe rather sharply. And then, in a more conciliatory tone, “This has gone far enough, Tommy.” They parleyed briskly for a moment—then Barban nodded and bowed coldly to his late antagonist.

“No shake hand?” suggested the French doctor.

“They already know each other,” said Abe.

He turned to McKisco.

“Come on, let’s get out.”

As they strode off, McKisco, in exultation, gripped his arm.

“Wait a minute!” Abe said. “Tommy wants his pistol back. He might need it again.”

McKisco handed it over.

“To hell with him,” he said in a tough voice. “Tell him he can—”

“Shall I tell him you want another shot?”

“Well, I did it,” cried McKisco, as they went along. “And I did it pretty well, didn’t I? I wasn’t yellow.”

“You were pretty drunk,” said Abe bluntly.

“No, I wasn’t.”

“All right, then, you weren’t.”

“Why would it make any difference if I had a drink or so?”

As his confidence mounted he looked resentfully at Abe.

“What difference does that make?” he repeated.

“If you can’t see it, there’s no use going into it.”

“Don’t you know everybody was drunk all the time during the war?”

“Well, let’s forget it.”

But the episode was not quite over. There were urgent footsteps in the heather behind them and the doctor drew up alongside.

“Pardon, Messieurs,” he panted. “Voulez-vous régler mes honorairies? Naturellement c’est pour soins médicaux seulement. M. Barban n’a qu’un billet de mille et ne peut pas les régler et l’autre a laissé son porte-monnaie chez lui.”

“Trust a Frenchman to think of that,” said Abe, and then to the doctor. “Combien?”

“Let me pay this,” said McKisco.

“No, I’ve got it. We were all in about the same danger.”

Abe paid the doctor while McKisco suddenly turned into the bushes and was sick there. Then paler than before he strutted on with Abe toward the car through the now rosy morning.

Campion lay gasping on his back in the shrubbery, the only casualty of the duel, while Rosemary suddenly hysterical with laughter kept kicking at him with her espadrille. She did this persistently until she roused him—the only matter of importance to her now was that in a few hours she would see the person whom she still referred to in her mind as“the Divers” on the beach.

They were at Voisins waiting for Nicole, six of them, Rosemary, the Norths, Dick Diver and two young French musicians. They were looking over the other patrons of the restaurant to see if they had repose—Dick said no American men had any repose, except himself, and they were seeking an example to confront him with. Things looked black for them—not a man had come into the restaurant for ten minutes without raising his hand to his face.

“We ought never to have given up waxed mustaches,” said Abe.“Nevertheless Dick isn’t the only man with repose—”

“Oh, yes, I am.”

“—but he may be the only sober man with repose.”

A well-dressed American had come in with two women who swooped and fluttered unself-consciously around a table. Suddenly, he perceived that he was being watched—whereupon his hand rose spasmodically and arranged a phantom bulge in his necktie. In another unseated party a man endlessly patted his shaven cheek with his palm, and his companion mechanically raised and lowered the stub of a cold cigar. The luckier ones fingered eyeglasses and facial hair, the unequipped stroked blank mouths, or even pulled desperately at the lobes of their ears.

A well-known general came in, and Abe, counting on the man’s first year at West Point—that year during which no cadet can resign and from which none ever recovers—made a bet with Dick of five dollars.

His hands hanging naturally at his sides, the general waited to be seated. Once his arms swung suddenly backward like a jumper’s and Dick said, “Ah!” supposing he had lost control, but the general recovered and they breathed again—the agony was nearly over, the garçon was pulling out his chair….

With a touch of fury the conqueror shot up his hand and scratched his gray immaculate head.

“You see,” said Dick smugly, “I’m the only one.”

Rosemary was quite sure of it and Dick, realizing that he never had a better audience, made the group into so bright a unit that Rosemary felt an impatient disregard for all who were not at their table. They had been two days in Paris but actually they were still under the beach umbrella. When, as at the ball of the Corps des Pages the night before, the surroundings seemed formidable to Rosemary, who had yet to attend a Mayfair party in Hollywood, Dick would bring the scene within range by greeting a few people, a sort of selection—the Divers seemed to have a large acquaintance, but it was always as if the person had not seen them for a long, long time, and was utterly bowled over, “Why, where do you keep yourselves?”—and then re-create the unity of his own party by destroying the outsiders softly but permanently with an ironic coup de grâce. Presently Rosemary seemed to have known those people herself in some deplorable past, and then got on to them, rejected them, discarded them.

Their own party was overwhelmingly American and sometimes scarcely American at all. It was themselves he gave back to them, blurred by the compromises of how many years.

Into the dark, smoky restaurant, smelling of the rich raw foods on the buffet, slid Nicole’s sky-blue suit like a stray segment of the weather outside. Seeing from their eyes how beautiful she was, she thanked them with a smile of radiant appreciation. They were all very nice people for a while, very courteous and all that. Then they grew tired of it and they were funny and bitter, and finally they made a lot of plans. They laughed at things that they would not remember clearly afterward—laughed a lot and the men drank three bottles of wine. The trio of women at the table were representative of the enormous flux of American life. Nicole was the granddaughter of a self-made American capitalist and the granddaughter of a Count of the House of Lippe Weissenfeld. Mary North was the daughter of a journeyman paper-hanger and a descendant of President Tyler. Rosemary was from the middle of the middle class, catapulted by her mother onto the uncharted heights of Hollywood. Their point of resemblance to each other and their difference from so many American women, lay in the fact that they were all happy to exist in a man’s world—they preserved their individuality through men and not by opposition to them. They would all three have made alternatively good courtesans or good wives not by the accident of birth but through the greater accident of finding their man or not finding him.

So Rosemary found it a pleasant party, that luncheon, nicer in that there were only seven people, about the limit of a good party. Perhaps, too, the fact that she was new to their world acted as a sort of catalytic agent to precipitate out all their old reservations about one another. After the table broke up, a waiter directed Rosemary back into the dark hinterland of all French restaurants, where she looked up a phone number by a dim orange bulb, and called Franco-American Films. Sure, they had a print of “Daddy’s Girl”—it was out for the moment, but they would run it off later in the week for her at 341 rue des Saints Anges—ask for Mr. Crowder.

The semi-booth gave on the vestiaire and as Rosemary hung up the receiver she heard two low voices not five feet from her on the other side of a row of coats.

“—So you love me?”

“Oh, do I!”

It was Nicole—Rosemary hesitated in the door of the booth—then she heard Dick say:

“I want you terribly—let’s go to the hotel now.” Nicole gave a little gasping sigh. For a moment the words conveyed nothing at all to Rosemary—but the tone did. The vast secretiveness of it vibrated to herself.

“I want you.”

“I’ll be at the hotel at four.”

Rosemary stood breathless as the voices moved away. She was at first even astonished—she had seen them in their relation to each other as people without personal exigencies—as something cooler. Now a strong current of emotion flowed through her, profound and unidentified. She did not know whether she was attracted or repelled, but only that she was deeply moved. It made her feel very alone as she went back into the restaurant, but it was touching to look in upon, and the passionate gratitude of Nicole’s “Oh, do I!” echoed in her mind. The particular mood of the passage she had witnessed lay ahead of her; but however far she was from it her stomach told her it was all right—she had none of the aversion she had felt in the playing of certain love scenes in pictures.

Being far away from it she nevertheless irrevocably participated in it now, and shopping with Nicole she was much more conscious of the assignation than Nicole herself. She looked at Nicole in a new way, estimating her attractions. Certainly she was the most attractive woman Rosemary had ever met—with her hardness, her devotions and loyalties, and a certain elusiveness, which Rosemary, thinking now through her mother’s middle-class mind, associated with her attitude about money. Rosemary spent money she had earned—she was here in Europe due to the fact that she had gone in the pool six times that January day with her temperature roving from 99° in the early morning to 103°, when her mother stopped it.

With Nicole’s help Rosemary bought two dresses and two hats and four pairs of shoes with her money. Nicole bought from a great list that ran two pages, and bought the things in the windows besides. Everything she liked that she couldn’t possibly use herself, she bought as a present for a friend. She bought colored beads, folding beach cushions, artificial flowers, honey, a guest bed, bags, scarfs, love birds, miniatures for a doll’s house and three yards of some new cloth the color of prawns. She bought a dozen bathing suits, a rubber alligator, a travelling chess set of gold and ivory, big linen handkerchiefs for Abe, two chamois leather jackets of kingfisher blue and burning bush from Hermès—bought all these things not a bit like a high-class courtesan buying underwear and jewels, which were after all professional equipment and insurance—but with an entirely different point of view. Nicole was the product of much ingenuity and toil. For her sake trains began their run at Chicago and traversed the round belly of the continent to California; chicle factories fumed and link belts grew link by link in factories; men mixed toothpaste in vats and drew mouthwash out of copper hogsheads; girls canned tomatoes quickly in August or worked rudely at the Five-and-Tens on Christmas Eve; half-breed Indians toiled on Brazilian coffee plantations and dreamers were muscled out of patent rights in new tractors—these were some of the people who gave a tithe to Nicole, and as the whole system swayed and thundered onward it lent a feverish bloom to such processes of hers as wholesale buying, like the flush of a fireman’s face holding his post before a spreading blaze. She illustrated very simple principles, containing in herself her own doom, but illustrated them so accurately that there was grace in the procedure, and presently Rosemary would try to imitate it.

It was almost four. Nicole stood in a shop with a love bird on her shoulder, and had one of her infrequent outbursts of speech.

“Well, what if you hadn’t gone in that pool that day—I sometimes wonder about such things. Just before the war we were in Berlin—I was thirteen, it was just before Mother died. My sister was going to a court ball and she had three of the royal princes on her dance card, all arranged by a chamberlain and everything. Half an hour before she was going to start she had a side ache and a high fever. The doctor said it was appendicitis and she ought to be operated on. But Mother had her plans made, so Baby went to the ball and danced till two with an ice pack strapped on under her evening dress. She was operated on at seven o’clock next morning.”

It was good to be hard, then; all nice people were hard on themselves. But it was four o’clock and Rosemary kept thinking of Dick waiting for Nicole now at the hotel. She must go there, she must not make him wait for her. She kept thinking, “Why don’t you go?” and then suddenly, “Or let me go if you don’t want to.” But Nicole went to one more place to buy corsages for them both and sent one to Mary North. Only then she seemed to remember and with sudden abstraction she signalled for a taxi.

“Good-by,” said Nicole. “We had fun, didn’t we?”

“Loads of fun,” said Rosemary. It was more difficult than she thought and her whole self protested as Nicole drove away.

Dick turned the corner of the traverse and continued along the trench walking on the duckboard. He came to a periscope, looked through it a moment; then he got up on the step and peered over the parapet. In front of him beneath a dingy sky was Beaumont-Hamel; to his left the tragic hill of Thiepval. Dick stared at them through his field glasses, his throat straining with sadness.

He went on along the trench, and found the others waiting for him in the next traverse. He was full of excitement and he wanted to communicate it to them, to make them understand about this, though actually Abe North had seen battle service and he had not.

“This land here cost twenty lives a foot that summer,” he said to Rosemary. She looked out obediently at the rather bare green plain with its low trees of six years’ growth. If Dick had added that they were now being shelled she would have believed him that afternoon. Her love had reached a point where now at last she was beginning to be unhappy, to be desperate. She didn’t know what to do—she wanted to talk to her mother.

“There are lots of people dead since and we’ll all be dead soon,” said Abe consolingly.

Rosemary waited tensely for Dick to continue.

“See that little stream—we could walk to it in two minutes. It took the British a month to walk to it—a whole empire walking very slowly, dying in front and pushing forward behind. And another empire walked very slowly backward a few inches a day, leaving the dead like a million bloody rugs. No Europeans will ever do that again in this generation.”

“Why, they’ve only just quit over in Turkey,” said Abe. “And in Morocco—”

“That’s different. This western-front business couldn’t be done again, not for a long time. The young men think they could do it but they couldn’t. They could fight the first Marne again but not this. This took religion and years of plenty and tremendous sureties and the exact relation that existed between the classes. The Russians and Italians weren’t any good on this front. You had to have a whole-souled sentimental equipment going back further than you could remember. You had to remember Christmas, and postcards of the Crown Prince and his fiancée, and little cafés in Valence and beer gardens in Unter den Linden and weddings at the mairie, and going to the Derby, and your grandfather’s whiskers.”

“General Grant invented this kind of battle at Petersburg in sixty-five.”

“No, he didn’t—he just invented mass butchery. This kind of battle was invented by Lewis Carroll and Jules Verne and whoever wrote Undine, and country deacons bowling and marraines in Marseilles and girls seduced in the back lanes of Württemberg and Westphalia. Why, this was a love battle—there was a century of middle-class love spent here. This was the last love battle.”

“You want to hand over this battle to D. H. Lawrence,” said Abe.

“All my beautiful lovely safe world blew itself up here with a great gust of high explosive love,” Dick mourned persistently. “Isn’t that true, Rosemary?”

“I don’t know,” she answered with a grave face. “You know everything.”

They dropped behind the others. Suddenly a shower of earth gobs and pebbles came down on them and Abe yelled from the next traverse:

“The war spirit’s getting into me again. I have a hundred years of Ohio love behind me and I’m going to bomb out this trench.” His head popped up over the embankment. “You’re dead—don’t you know the rules? That was a grenade.”

Rosemary laughed and Dick picked up a retaliatory handful of stones and then put them down.

“I couldn’t kid here,” he said rather apologetically. “The silver cord is cut and the golden bowl is broken and all that, but an old romantic like me can’t do anything about it.”

“I’m romantic too.”

They came out of the neat restored trench, and faced a memorial to the Newfoundland dead. Reading the inscription Rosemary burst into sudden tears. Like most women she liked to be told how she should feel, and she liked Dick’s telling her which things were ludicrous and which things were sad. But most of all she wanted him to know how she loved him, now that the fact was upsetting everything, now that she was walking over the battle-field in a thrilling dream.

After that they got in their car and started back toward Amiens. A thin warm rain was falling on the new scrubby woods and underbrush and they passed great funeral pyres of sorted duds, shells, bombs, grenades, and equipment, helmets, bayonets, gun stocks and rotten leather, abandoned six years in the ground. And suddenly around a bend the white caps of a great sea of graves. Dick asked the chauffeur to stop.

“There’s that girl—and she still has her wreath.”

They watched as he got out and went over to the girl, who stood uncertainly by the gate with a wreath in her hand. Her taxi waited. She was a red-haired girl from Tennessee whom they had met on the train this morning, come from Knoxville to lay a memorial on her brother’s grave. There were tears of vexation on her face.

“The War Department must have given me the wrong number,” she whimpered. “It had another name on it. I been lookin’ for it since two o’clock, and there’s so many graves.”

“Then if I were you I’d just lay it on any grave without looking at the name,” Dick advised her.

“You reckon that’s what I ought to do?”

“I think that’s what he’d have wanted you to do.”

It was growing dark and the rain was coming down harder. She left the wreath on the first grave inside the gate, and accepted Dick’s suggestion that she dismiss her taxi-cab and ride back to Amiens with them.

Rosemary shed tears again when she heard of the mishap—altogether it had been a watery day, but she felt that she had learned something, though exactly what it was she did not know. Later she remembered all the hours of the afternoon as happy—one of those uneventful times that seem at the moment only a link between past and future pleasure but turn out to have been the pleasure itself.

Amiens was an echoing purple town, still sad with the war, as some railroad stations were: the Gare du Nord and Waterloo station in London. In the daytime one is deflated by such towns, with their little trolley cars of twenty years ago crossing the great gray cobble-stoned squares in front of the cathedral, and the very weather seems to have a quality of the past, faded weather like that of old photographs. But after dark all that is most satisfactory in French life swims back into the picture—the sprightly tarts, the men arguing with a hundred Voilàs in the cafés, the couples drifting, head to head, toward the satisfactory inexpensiveness of nowhere. Waiting for the train they sat in a big arcade, tall enough to release the smoke and chatter and music upward and obligingly the orchestra launched into“Yes, We Have No Bananas”—they clapped, because the leader looked so pleased with himself. The Tennessee girl forgot her sorrow and enjoyed herself, even began flirtations of tropical eye-rollings and pawings, with Dick and Abe. They teased her gently.

Then, leaving infinitesimal sections of Württembergers, Prussian Guards, chasseurs alpins, Manchester mill hands and Old Etonians to pursue their eternal dissolution under the warm rain, they took the train for Paris. They ate sandwiches of mortadel sausage and bel paese cheese made up in the station restaurant, and drank Beaujolais. Nicole was abstracted, biting her lip restlessly and reading over the guide-books to the battle-field that Dick had brought along—indeed, he had made a quick study of the whole affair, simplifying it always until it bore a faint resemblance to one of his own parties.

When they reached Paris Nicole was too tired to go on to the grand illumination at the Decorative Arts Exposition as they had planned. They left her at the Hôtel Roi George, and as she disappeared between the intersecting planes made by lobby lights of the glass doors, Rosemary’s oppression lifted. Nicole was a force—not necessarily well disposed or predictable like her mother—an incalculable force. Rosemary was somewhat afraid of her.

At eleven she sat with Dick and the Norths at a houseboat café just opened on the Seine. The river shimmered with lights from the bridges and cradled many cold moons. On Sundays sometimes when Rosemary and her mother had lived in Paris they had taken the little steamer up to Suresnes and talked about plans for the future. They had little money but Mrs. Speers was so sure of Rosemary’s beauty and had implanted in her so much ambition, that she was willing to gamble the money on“advantages;” Rosemary in turn was to repay her mother when she got her start….

Since reaching Paris Abe North had had a thin vinous fur over him; his eyes were bloodshot from sun and wine. Rosemary realized for the first time that he was always stopping in places to get a drink, and she wondered how Mary North liked it. Mary was quiet, so quiet save for her frequent laughter that Rosemary had learned little about her. She liked the straight dark hair brushed back until it met some sort of natural cascade that took care of it—from time to time it eased with a jaunty slant over the corner of her temple, until it was almost in her eye when she tossed her head and caused it to fall sleek into place once more.

“We’ll turn in early to-night, Abe, after this drink.” Mary’s voice was light but it held a little flicker of anxiety. “You don’t want to be poured on the boat.”

“It’s pretty late now,” Dick said. “We’d all better go.”

The noble dignity of Abe’s face took on a certain stubbornness, and he remarked with determination:

“Oh, no.” He paused gravely. “Oh, no, not yet. We’ll have another bottle of champagne.”

“No more for me,” said Dick.

“It’s Rosemary I’m thinking of. She’s a natural alcoholic—keeps a bottle of gin in the bathroom and all that—her mother told me.”

He emptied what was left of the first bottle into Rosemary’s glass. She had made herself quite sick the first day in Paris with quarts of lemonade; after that she had taken nothing with them, but now she raised the champagne and drank at it.

“But what’s this?” exclaimed Dick. “You told me you didn’t drink.”

“I didn’t say I was never going to.”

“What about your mother?”

“I’m just going to drink this one glass.” She felt some necessity for it. Dick drank, not too much, but he drank, and perhaps it would bring her closer to him, be a part of the equipment for what she had to do. She drank it quickly, choked and then said, “Besides, yesterday was my birthday—I was eighteen.”

“Why didn’t you tell us?” they said indignantly.

“I knew you’d make a fuss over it and go to a lot of trouble.” She finished the champagne. “So this is the celebration.”

“It most certainly is not,” Dick assured her. “The dinner to-morrow night is your birthday party and don’t forget it. Eighteen—why that’s a terribly important age.”

“I used to think until you’re eighteen nothing matters,” said Mary.

“That’s right,” Abe agreed. “And afterward it’s the same way.”

“Abe feels that nothing matters till he gets on the boat,” said Mary.“This time he really has got everything planned out when he gets to New York.” She spoke as though she were tired of saying things that no longer had a meaning for her, as if in reality the course that she and her husband followed, or failed to follow, had become merely an intention.

“He’ll be writing music in America and I’ll be working at singing in Munich, so when we get together again there’ll be nothing we can’t do.”

“That’s wonderful,” agreed Rosemary, feeling the champagne.

“Meanwhile, another touch of champagne for Rosemary. Then she’ll be more able to rationalize the acts of her lymphatic glands. They only begin to function at eighteen.”

Dick laughed indulgently at Abe, whom he loved, and in whom he had long lost hope:“That’s medically incorrect and we’re going.” Catching the faint patronage Abe said lightly:

“Something tells me I’ll have a new score on Broadway long before you’ve finished your scientific treatise.”

“I hope so,” said Dick evenly. “I hope so. I may even abandon what you call my ‘scientific treatise.’ ”

“Oh, Dick!” Mary’s voice was startled, was shocked. Rosemary had never before seen Dick’s face utterly expressionless; she felt that this announcement was something momentous and she was inclined to exclaim with Mary, “Oh, Dick!”

But suddenly Dick laughed again, added to his remark “—abandon it for another one,” and got up from the table.

“But Dick, sit down. I want to know—”

“I’ll tell you some time. Good night, Abe. Good night, Mary.”

“Good night, dear Dick.” Mary smiled as if she were going to be perfectly happy sitting there on the almost deserted boat. She was a brave,hopeful woman and she was following her husband somewhere, changing herself to this kind of person or that, without being able to lead him a step out of his path, and sometimes realizing with discouragement how deep in him the guarded secret of her direction lay. And yet an air of luck clung about her, as if she were a sort of token....

“What is it you are giving up?” demanded Rosemary, facing Dick earnestly in the taxi.

“Nothing of importance.”

“Are you a scientist?”

“I’m a doctor of medicine.”

“Oh-h!” she smiled delightedly. “My father was a doctor too. Then why don’t you—” she stopped.

“There’s no mystery. I didn’t disgrace myself at the height of my career, and hide away on the Riviera. I’m just not practising. You can’t tell, I’ll probably practise again some day.”

Rosemary put up her face quietly to be kissed. He looked at her for a moment as if he didn’t understand. Then holding her in the hollow of his arm he rubbed his cheek against her cheek’s softness, and then looked down at her for another long moment.

“Such a lovely child,” he said gravely.

She smiled up at him; her hands playing conventionally with the lapels of his coat. “I’m in love with you and Nicole. Actually that’s my secret—I can’t even talk about you to anybody because I don’t want any more people to know how wonderful you are. Honestly—I love you and Nicole—I do.”

—So many times he had heard this—even the formula was the same.

Suddenly she came toward him, her youth vanishing as she passed inside the focus of his eyes and he had kissed her breathlessly as if she were any age at all. Then she lay back against his arm and sighed.

“I’ve decided to give you up,” she said.

Dick started—had he said anything to imply that she possessed any part of him?

“But that’s very mean,” he managed to say lightly, “just when I was getting interested.”

“I’ve loved you so—” As if it had been for years. She was weeping a little now. “I’ve loved you so-o-o.”

Then he should have laughed, but he heard himself saying, “Not only are you beautiful but you are somehow on the grand scale. Everything you do, like pretending to be in love or pretending to be shy gets across.”

In the dark cave of the taxi, fragrant with the perfume Rosemary had bought with Nicole, she came close again, clinging to him. He kissed her without enjoying it. He knew that there was passion there, but there was no shadow of it in her eyes or on her mouth; there was a faint spray of champagne on her breath. She clung nearer desperately and once more he kissed her and was chilled by the innocence of her kiss, by the glance that at the moment of contact looked beyond him out into the darkness of the night, the darkness of the world. She did not know yet that splendor is something in the heart; at the moment when she realized that and melted into the passion of the universe he could take her without question or regret.

Her room in the hotel was diagonally across from theirs and nearer the elevator. When they reached the door she said suddenly:

“I know you don’t love me—I don’t expect it. But you said I should have told you about my birthday. Well, I did, and now for my birthday present I want you to come into my room a minute while I tell you something. Just one minute.”

They went in and he closed the door, and Rosemary stood close to him, not touching him. The night had drawn the color from her face—she was pale as pale now, she was a white carnation left after a dance.

“When you smile—” He had recovered his paternal attitude, perhaps because of Nicole’s silent proximity, “I always think I’ll see a gap where you’ve lost some baby teeth.”

But he was too late—she came close up against him with a forlorn whisper.

“Take me.”

“Take you where?”

Astonishment froze him rigid.

“Go on,” she whispered. “Oh, please go on, whatever they do. I don’t care if I don’t like it—I never expected to—I’ve always hated to think about it but now I don’t. I want you to.”

She was astonished at herself—she had never imagined she could talk like that. She was calling on things she had read, seen, dreamed through a decade of convent hours. Suddenly she knew too that it was one of her greatest rôles and she flung herself into it more passionately.

“This is not as it should be,” Dick deliberated. “Isn’t it just the champagne? Let’s more or less forget it.”

“Oh, no, now. I want you to do it now, take me, show me, I’m absolutely yours and I want to be.”

“For one thing, have you thought how much it would hurt Nicole.”

“She won’t know—this won’t have anything to do with her.”

He continued kindly.

“Then there’s the fact that I love Nicole.”

“But you can love more than just one person, can’t you? Like I love Mother and I love you—more. I love you more now.”

“—the fourth place you’re not in love with me but you might be afterwards, and that would begin your life with a terrible mess.”

“No, I promise I’ll never see you again. I’ll get Mother and go to America right away.”

He dismissed this. He was remembering too vividly the youth and freshness of her lips. He took another tone.

“You’re just in that mood.”

“Oh, please, I don’t care even if I had a baby. I could go into Mexico like a girl at the studio. Oh, this is so different from anything I ever thought—I used to hate it when they kissed me seriously.” He saw she was still under the impression that it must happen. “Some of them had great big teeth, but you’re all different and beautiful. I want you to do it.”

“I believe you think people just kiss some way and you want me to kiss you.”

“Oh, don’t tease me—I’m not a baby. I know you’re not in love with me.” She was suddenly humble and quiet. “I didn’t expect that much. I know I must seem just nothing to you.”

“Nonsense. But you seem young to me.” His thoughts added,“—there’d be so much to teach you.”

Rosemary waited, breathing eagerly till Dick said:“And lastly things aren’t arranged so that this could be as you want.”

Her face drooped with dismay and disappointment and Dick said automatically, “We’ll have to simply—” He stopped himself, followed her to the bed, sat down beside her while she wept. He was suddenly confused, not about the ethics of the matter, for the impossibility of it was sheerly indicated from all angles, but simply confused, and for a moment his usual grace, the tensile strength of his balance, was absent.

“I knew you wouldn’t,” she sobbed. “It was just a forlorn hope.”

He stood up.

“Good night, child. This is a damn shame. Let’s drop it out of the picture.” He gave her two lines of hospital patter to go to sleep on. “So many people are going to love you and it might be nice to meet your first love all intact, emotionally too. That’s an old-fashioned idea, isn’t it?” She looked up at him as he took a step toward the door; she looked at him without the slightest idea as to what was in his head, she saw him take another step in slow motion, turn and look at her again, and she wanted for a moment to hold him and devour him, wanted his mouth, his ears, his coat collar, wanted to surround him and engulf him; she saw his hand fall on the doorknob. Then she gave up and sank back on the bed. When the door closed she got up and went to the mirror, where she began brushing her hair, sniffling a little. One hundred and fifty strokes Rosemary gave it, as usual, then a hundred and fifty more. She brushed it until her arm ached, then she changed arms and went on brushing….

She woke up cooled and shamed. The sight of her beauty in the mirror did not reassure her but only awakened the ache of yesterday and a letter, forwarded by her mother, from the boy who had taken her to the Yale prom last fall, which announced his presence in Paris, was no help—all that seemed far away. She emerged from her room for the ordeal of meeting the Divers weighted with a double trouble. But it was hidden by a sheath as impermeable as Nicole’s when they met and went together to a series of fittings. It was consoling, though, when Nicole remarked, apropos of a distraught saleswoman:“Most people think everybody feels about them much more violently than they actually do—they think other people’s opinions of them swing through great arcs of approval or disapproval.” Yesterday in her expansiveness Rosemary would have resented that remark—to-day in her desire to minimize what had happened she welcomed it eagerly. She admired Nicole for her beauty and her wisdom, and also for the first time in her life she was jealous. Just before leaving Gausse’s Hôtel her mother had said in that casual tone, which Rosemary knew concealed her most significant opinions, that Nicole was a great beauty, with the frank implication that Rosemary was not. This did not bother Rosemary, who had only recently been allowed to learn that she was even personable; so that her prettiness never seemed exactly her own but rather an acquirement, like her French. Nevertheless, in the taxi she looked at Nicole, matching herself against her. There were all the potentialities for romantic love in that lovely body and in the delicate mouth, sometimes tight, sometimes expectantly half open to the world. Nicole had been a beauty as a young girl and she would be a beauty later when her skin stretched tight over her high cheek-bones—the essential structure was there. She had been white-Saxon-blonde but she was more beautiful now that her hair had darkened than when it had been like a cloud and more beautiful than she.

“We lived there,” Rosemary suddenly pointed to a building in the rue des Saints-Pères.

“That’s strange. Because when I was twelve Mother and Baby and I once spent a winter there,” and she pointed to a hotel directly across the street. The two dingy fronts stared at them, gray echoes of girlhood.

“We’d just built our Lake Forest house and we were economizing,” Nicole continued. “At least Baby and I and the governess economized and Mother travelled.”

“We were economizing too,” said Rosemary, realizing that the word meant different things to them.

“Mother always spoke of it very carefully as a small hotel—” Nicole gave her quick magnetic little laugh, “—I mean instead of saying a‘cheap’ hotel. If any swanky friends asked us our address we’d never say,‘We’re in a dingy little hole over in the apache quarter where we’re glad of running water,’—we’d say ‘We’re in a small hotel.’ As if all the big ones were too noisy and vulgar for us. Of course the friends always saw through us and told everyone about it, but Mother always said it showed we knew our way around Europe. She did, of course: she was born a German citizen. But her mother was American, and she was brought up in Chicago, and she was more American than European.”

They were meeting the others in two minutes, and Rosemary reconstructed herself once more as they got out of the taxi in the rue Guynemer, across from the Luxembourg Gardens. They were lunching in the Norths’ already dismantled apartment high above the green mass of leaves. The day seemed different to Rosemary from the day before. When she saw him face to face their eyes met and brushed like birds’ wings. After that everything was all right, everything was wonderful, she knew that he was beginning to fall in love with her. She felt wildly happy, felt the warm sap of emotion being pumped through her body. A cool, clear confidence deepened and sang in her. She scarcely looked at Dick but she knew everything was all right.

After luncheon the Divers and the Norths and Rosemary went to the Franco-American Films, to be joined by Collis Clay, her young man from New Haven, to whom she had telephoned. He was a Georgian, with the peculiarly regular, even stencilled ideas of Southerners who are educated in the North. Last winter she had thought him attractive—once they held hands in an automobile going from New Haven to New York; now he no longer existed for her.

In the projection room she sat between Collis Clay and Dick while the mechanic mounted the reels of “Daddy’s Girl” and a French executive fluttered about her trying to talk American slang. “Yes, boy,” he said when there was trouble with the projector, “I have not any benenas.” Then the lights went out, there was the sudden click and a flickering noise and she was alone with Dick at last. They looked at each other in the half darkness.

“Dear Rosemary,” he murmured. Their shoulders touched. Nicole stirred restlessly at the end of the row and Abe coughed convulsively and blew his nose; then they all settled down and the picture ran.

There she was—the school girl of a year ago, hair down her back and rippling out stiffly like the solid hair of a Tanagra figure; there she was—so young and innocent—the product of her mother’s loving care; there she was—embodying all the immaturity of the race, cutting a new cardboard paper doll to pass before its empty harlot’s mind. She remembered how she had felt in that dress, especially fresh and new under the fresh young silk.

Daddy’s girl. Was it a ’itty-bitty bravekins and did it suffer? Ooo-ooo-tweet, de tweetest thing, wasn’t she dest too tweet? Before her tiny fist the forces of lust and corruption rolled away; nay, the very march of destiny stopped; inevitable became evitable, syllogism, dialectic, all rationality fell away. Women would forget the dirty dishes at home and weep, even within the picture one woman wept so long that she almost stole the film away from Rosemary. She wept all over a set that cost a fortune, in a Duncan Phyfe dining-room, in an aviation port, and during a yacht-race that was only used in two flashes, in a subway and finally in a bathroom. But Rosemary triumphed. Her fineness of character, her courage and steadfastness intruded upon by the vulgarity of the world, and Rosemary showing what it took with a face that had not yet become mask-like—yet it was actually so moving that the emotions of the whole row of people went out to her at intervals during the picture. There was a break once and the light went on and after the chatter of applause Dick said to her sincerely:“I’m simply astounded. You’re going to be one of the best actresses on the stage.”

Then back to “Daddy’s Girl”: happier days now, and a lovely shot of Rosemary and her parent united at the last in a father complex so apparent that Dick winced for all psychologists at the vicious sentimentality. The screen vanished, the lights went on, the moment had come.

“I’ve arranged one other thing,” announced Rosemary to the company at large, “I’ve arranged a test for Dick.”

“A what?”

“A screen test, they’ll take one now.”

There was an awful silence—then an irrepressible chortle from the Norths. Rosemary watched Dick comprehend what she meant, his face moving first in an Irish way; simultaneously she realized that she had made some mistake in the playing of her trump and still she did not suspect that the card was at fault.

“I don’t want a test,” said Dick firmly; then, seeing the situation as a whole, he continued lightly, “Rosemary, I’m disappointed. The pictures make a fine career for a woman—but my God, they can’t photograph me. I’m an old scientist all wrapped up in his private life.”

Nicole and Mary urged him ironically to seize the opportunity; they teased him, both faintly annoyed at not having been asked for a sitting. But Dick closed the subject with a somewhat tart discussion of actors:“The strongest guard is placed at the gateway to nothing,” he said. “Maybe because the condition of emptiness is too shameful to be divulged.”

In the taxi with Dick and Collis Clay—they were dropping Collis, and Dick was taking Rosemary to a tea from which Nicole and the Norths had resigned in order to do the things Abe had left undone till the last—in the taxi Rosemary reproached him.

“I thought if the test turned out to be good I could take it to California with me. And then maybe if they liked it you’d come out and be my leading man in a picture.”

He was overwhelmed. “It was a darn sweet thought, but I’d rather look at you. You were about the nicest sight I ever looked at.”

“That’s a great picture,” said Collis. “I’ve seen it four times. I know one boy at New Haven who’s seen it a dozen times—he went all the way to Hartford to see it one time. And when I brought Rosemary up to New Haven he was so shy he wouldn’t meet her. Can you beat that? This little girl knocks them cold.”

Dick and Rosemary looked at each other, wanting to be alone, but Collis failed to understand.

“I’ll drop you where you’re going,” he suggested. “I’m staying at the Lutétia.”

“We’ll drop you,” said Dick.

“It’ll be easier for me to drop you. No trouble at all.”

“I think it will be better if we drop you.”

“But—” began Collis; he grasped the situation at last and began discussing with Rosemary when he would see her again.

Finally, he was gone, with the shadowy unimportance but the offensive bulk of the third party. The car stopped unexpectedly, unsatisfactorily, at the address Dick had given. He drew a long breath.

“Shall we go in.”

“I don’t care,” Rosemary said. “I’ll do anything you want.”

He considered.

“I almost have to go in—she wants to buy some pictures from a friend of mine who needs the money.”

Rosemary smoothed the brief expressive disarray of her hair.

“We’ll stay just five minutes,” he decided. “You’re not going to like these people.”

She assumed that they were dull and stereotyped people, or gross and drunken people, or tiresome, insistent people, or any of the sorts of people that the Divers avoided. She was entirely unprepared for the impression that the scene made on her.

It was a house hewn from the frame of Cardinal de Retz’s palace in the rue Monsieur, but once inside the door there was nothing of the past, nor of any present that Rosemary knew. The outer shell, the masonry, seemed rather to enclose the future so that it was an electric-like shock, a definite nervous experience, perverted as a breakfast of oatmeal and hashish, to cross that threshold, if it could be so called, into the long hall of blue steel, silver-gilt, and the myriad facets of many oddly bevelled mirrors. The effect was unlike that of any part of the Decorative Arts Exhibition—for there were people in it, not in front of it. Rosemary had the detached false-and-exalted feeling of being on a set and she guessed that every one else present had that feeling too.

There were about thirty people, mostly women, and all fashioned by Louisa M. Alcott or Madame de Ségur; and they functioned on this set as cautiously, as precisely, as does a human hand picking up jagged broken glass. Neither individually nor as a crowd could they be said to dominate the environment, as one comes to dominate a work of art he may possess, no matter how esoteric, no one knew what this room meant because it was evolving into something else, becoming everything a room was not; to exist in it was as difficult as walking on a highly polished moving stairway, and no one could succeed at all save with the aforementioned qualities of a hand moving among broken glass—which qualities limited and defined the majority of those present.

These were of two sorts. There were the Americans and English who had been dissipating all spring and summer, so that now everything they did had a purely nervous inspiration. They were very quiet and lethargic at certain hours and then they exploded into sudden quarrels and breakdowns and seductions. The other class, who might be called the exploiters, was formed by the sponges, who were sober, serious people by comparison, with a purpose in life and no time for fooling. These kept their balance best in that environment, and what tone there was, beyond the apartment’s novel organization of light values, came from them.

The Frankenstein took down Dick and Rosemary at a gulp—it separated them immediately and Rosemary suddenly discovered herself to be an insincere little person, living all in the upper registers of her throat and wishing the director would come. There was however such a wild beating of wings in the room that she did not feel her position was more incongruous than any one else’s. In addition, her training told and after a series of semi-military turns, shifts, and marches she found herself presumably talking to a neat, slick girl with a lovely boy’s face, but actually absorbed by a conversation taking place on a sort of gun-metal ladder diagonally opposite her and four feet away.

There was a trio of young women sitting on the bench. They were all tall and slender with small heads groomed like manikins’ heads, and as they talked the heads waved gracefully about above their dark tailored suits, rather like long-stemmed flowers and rather like cobras’ hoods.

“Oh, they give a good show,” said one of them, in a deep rich voice.“Practically the best show in Paris—I’d be the last one to deny that. But after all—” She sighed. “Those phrases he uses over and over—‘Oldest inhabitant gnawed by rodents.’ You laugh once.”

“I prefer people whose lives have more corrugated surfaces,” said the second, “and I don’t like her.”

“I’ve never really been able to get very excited about them, or their entourage either. Why, for example, the entirely liquid Mr. North?”

“He’s out,” said the first girl. “But you must admit that the party in question can be one of the most charming human beings you have ever met.”

It was the first hint Rosemary had had that they were talking about the Divers, and her body grew tense with indignation. But the girl talking to her, in the starched blue shirt with the bright blue eyes and the red cheeks and the very gray suit, a poster of a girl, had begun to play up. Desperately she kept sweeping things from between them, afraid that Rosemary couldn’t see her, sweeping them away until presently there was not so much as a veil of brittle humor hiding the girl, and with distaste Rosemary saw her plain.

“Couldn’t you have lunch, or maybe dinner, or lunch the day after?” begged the girl. Rosemary looked about for Dick, finding him with the hostess, to whom he had been talking since they came in. Their eyes met and he nodded slightly, and simultaneously the three cobra women noticed her; their long necks darted toward her and they fixed finely critical glances upon her. She looked back at them defiantly, acknowledging that she had heard what they said. Then she threw off her exigent vis-à-vis with a polite but clipped parting that she had just learned from Dick, and went over to join him. The hostess—she was another tall rich American girl, promenading insouciantly upon the national prosperity—was asking Dick innumerable questions about Gausse’s Hôtel, whither she evidently wanted to come, and battering persistently against his reluctance. Rosemary’s presence reminded her that she had been recalcitrant as a hostess and glancing about she said:“Have you met any one amusing, have you met Mr.—” Her eyes groped for a male who might interest Rosemary, but Dick said they must go. They left immediately, moving over the brief threshold of the future to the sudden past of the stone façade without.

“Wasn’t it terrible?” he said.

“Terrible,” she echoed obediently.

“Rosemary?”

She murmured, “What?” in an awed voice.

“I feel terribly about this.”

She was shaken with audibly painful sobs. “Have you got a handkerchief?” she faltered. But there was little time to cry, and lovers now they fell ravenously on the quick seconds while outside the taxi windows the green and cream twilight faded, and the fire-red, gas-blue, ghost-green signs began to shine smokily through the tranquil rain. It was nearly six, the streets were in movement, the bistros gleamed, the Place de la Concorde moved by in pink majesty as the cab turned north.

They looked at each other at last, murmuring names that were a spell. Softly the two names lingered on the air, died away more slowly than other words, other names, slower than music in the mind.

“I don’t know what came over me last night,” Rosemary said. “That glass of champagne? I’ve never done anything like that before.”

“You simply said you loved me.”

“I do love you—I can’t change that.” It was time for Rosemary to cry, so she cried a little in her handkerchief.

“I’m afraid I’m in love with you,” said Dick, “and that’s not the best thing that could happen.”

Again the names—then they lurched together as if the taxi had swung them. Her breasts crushed flat against him, her mouth was all new and warm, owned in common. They stopped thinking with an almost painful relief, stopped seeing; they only breathed and sought each other. They were both in the gray gentle world of a mild hangover of fatigue when the nerves relax in bunches like piano strings, and crackle suddenly like wicker chairs. Nerves so raw and tender must surely join other nerves, lips to lips, breast to breast….

They were still in the happier stage of love. They were full of brave illusions about each other, tremendous illusions, so that the communion of self with self seemed to be on a plane where no other human relations mattered. They both seemed to have arrived there with an extraordinary innocence as though a series of pure accidents had driven them together, so many accidents that at last they were forced to conclude that they were for each other. They had arrived with clean hands, or so it seemed, after no traffic with the merely curious and clandestine.

But for Dick that portion of the road was short; the turning came before they reached the hotel.

“There’s nothing to do about it,” he said, with a feeling of panic. “I’m in love with you but it doesn’t change what I said last night.”

“That doesn’t matter now. I just wanted to make you love me—if you love me everything’s all right.”

“Unfortunately I do. But Nicole mustn’t know—she mustn’t suspect even faintly. Nicole and I have got to go on together. In a way that’s more important than just wanting to go on.”

“Kiss me once more.”

He kissed her, but momentarily he had left her.

“Nicole mustn’t suffer—she loves me and I love her—you understand that.”

She did understand—it was the sort of thing she understood well, not hurting people. She knew the Divers loved each other because it had been her primary assumption. She had thought however that it was a rather cooled relation, and actually rather like the love of herself and her mother. When people have so much for outsiders didn’t it indicate a lack of inner intensity?

“And I mean love,” he said, guessing her thoughts. “Active love—it’s more complicated than I can tell you. It was responsible for that crazy duel.”

“How did you know about the duel? I thought we were to keep it from you.”

“Do you think Abe can keep a secret?” He spoke with incisive irony.“Tell a secret over the radio, publish it in a tabloid, but never tell it to a man who drinks more than three or four a day.”

She laughed in agreement, staying close to him.

“So you understand my relations with Nicole are complicated. She’s not very strong—she looks strong but she isn’t. And this makes rather a mess.”

“Oh, say that later! But kiss me now—love me now. I’ll love you and never let Nicole see.”

“You darling.”

They reached the hotel and Rosemary walked a little behind him, to admire him, to adore him. His step was alert as if he had just come from some great doings and was hurrying on toward others. Organizer of private gaiety, curator of a richly incrusted happiness. His hat was a perfect hat and he carried a heavy stick and yellow gloves. She thought what a good time they would all have being with him to-night.

They walked upstairs—five flights. At the first landing they stopped and kissed; she was careful on the next landing, on the third more careful still. On the next—there were two more—she stopped half way and kissed him fleetingly good-by. At his urgency she walked down with him to the one below for a minute—and then up and up. Finally it was good-by with their hands stretching to touch along the diagonal of the banister and then the fingers slipping apart. Dick went back downstairs to make some arrangements for the evening—Rosemary ran to her room and wrote a letter to her mother; she was conscience-stricken because she did not miss her mother at all.

Although the Divers were honestly apathetic to organized fashion, they were nevertheless too acute to abandon its contemporaneous rhythm and beat—Dick’s parties were all concerned with excitement, and a chance breath of fresh night air was the more precious for being experienced in the intervals of the excitement.

The party that night moved with the speed of a slapstick comedy. They were twelve, they were sixteen, they were quartets in separate motors bound on a quick odyssey over Paris. Everything had been foreseen. People joined them as if by magic, accompanied them as specialists, almost guides, through a phase of the evening, dropped out and were succeeded by other people, so that it appeared as if the freshness of each one had been husbanded for them all day. Rosemary appreciated how different it was from any party in Hollywood, no matter how splendid in scale. There was, among many diversions, the car of the Shah of Persia. Where Dick had commandeered this vehicle, what bribery was employed, these were facts of irrelevance. Rosemary accepted it as merely a new facet of the fabulous, which for two years had filled her life. The car had been built on a special chassis in America. Its wheels were of silver, so was the radiator. The inside of the body was inlaid with innumerable brilliants which would be replaced with true gems by the court jeweller when the car arrived in Teheran the following week. There was only one real seat in back, because the Shah must ride alone, so they took turns riding in it and sitting on the marten fur that covered the floor.

But always there was Dick. Rosemary assured the image of her mother, ever carried with her, that never, never had she known any one so nice, so thoroughly nice as Dick was that night. She compared him with the two Englishmen, whom Abe addressed conscientiously as “Major Hengest and Mr. Horsa,” and with the heir to a Scandinavian throne and the novelist just back from Russia, and with Abe, who was desperate and witty, and with Collis Clay, who joined them somewhere and stayed along—and felt there was no comparison. The enthusiasm, the selflessness behind the whole performance ravished her, the technic of moving many varied types, each as immobile, as dependent on supplies of attention as an infantry battalion is dependent on rations, appeared so effortless that he still had pieces of his own most personal self for everyone.

—Afterward she remembered the times when she had felt the happiest. The first time was when she and Dick danced together and she felt her beauty sparkling bright against his tall, strong form as they floated,hovering like people in an amusing dream—he turned her here and there with such a delicacy of suggestion that she was like a bright bouquet, a piece of precious cloth being displayed before fifty eyes. There was a moment when they were not dancing at all, simply clinging together. Some time in the early morning they were alone, and her damp powdery young body came up close to him in a crush of tired cloth, and stayed there, crushed against a background of other people’s hats and wraps….

The time she laughed most was later, when six of them, the best of them, noblest relics of the evening, stood in the dusky front lobby of the Ritz telling the night concierge that General Pershing was outside and wanted caviare and champagne. “He brooks no delay. Every man, every gun is at his service.” Frantic waiters emerged from nowhere, a table was set in the lobby, and Abe came in representing General Pershing while they stood up and mumbled remembered fragments of war songs at him. In the waiters’ injured reaction to this anti-climax they found themselves neglected, so they built a waiter trap—a huge and fantastic device constructed of all the furniture in the lobby and functioning like one of the bizarre machines of a Goldberg cartoon. Abe shook his head doubtfully at it.

“Perhaps it would be better to steal a musical saw and—”

“That’s enough,” Mary interrupted. “When Abe begins bringing up that it’s time to go home.” Anxiously she confided to Rosemary:

“I’ve got to get Abe home. His boat train leaves at eleven. It’s so important—I feel the whole future depends on his catching it, but whenever I argue with him he does the exact opposite.”

“I’ll try and persuade him,” offered Rosemary.

“Would you?” Mary said doubtfully. “Maybe you could.”

Then Dick came up to Rosemary:

“Nicole and I are going home and we thought you’d want to go with us.”

Her face was pale with fatigue in the false dawn. Two wan dark spots in her cheek marked where the color was by day.

“I can’t,” she said. “I promised Mary North to stay along with them—or Abe’ll never go to bed. Maybe you could do something.”

“Don’t you know you can’t do anything about people?” he advised her. “If Abe was my room-mate in college, tight for the first time, it’d be different. Now there’s nothing to do.”

“Well, I’ve got to stay. He says he’ll go to bed if we only come to the Halles with him,” she said, almost defiantly.

He kissed the inside of her elbow quickly.

“Don’t let Rosemary go home alone,” Nicole called to Mary as they left. “We feel responsible to her mother.”

—Later Rosemary and the Norths and a manufacturer of dolls’ voices from Newark and ubiquitous Collis and a big splendidly dressed oil Indian named George T. Horseprotection were riding along on top of thousands of carrots in a market wagon. The earth in the carrot beards was fragrant and sweet in the darkness, and Rosemary was so high up in the load that she could hardly see the others in the long shadow between infrequent street lamps. Their voices came from far off, as if they were having experiences different from hers, different and far away, for she was with Dick in her heart, sorry she had come with the Norths, wishing she was at the hotel and him asleep across the hall, or that he was here beside her with the warm darkness streaming down.

“Don’t come up,” she called to Collis, “the carrots will all roll.” She threw one at Abe who was sitting beside the driver, stiffly like an old man….

Later she was homeward bound at last in broad daylight, with the pigeons already breaking over Saint-Sulpice. All of them began to laugh spontaneously because they knew it was still last night while the people in the streets had the delusion that it was bright hot morning.

“At last I’ve been on a wild party,” thought Rosemary, “but it’s no fun when Dick isn’t there.”

She felt a little betrayed and sad, but presently a moving object came into sight. It was a huge horse-chestnut tree in full bloom bound for the Champs-Élysées, strapped now into a long truck and simply shaking with laughter—like a lovely person in an undignified position yet confident none the less of being lovely. Looking at it with fascination Rosemary identified herself with it, and laughed cheerfully with it, and everything all at once seemed gorgeous.





19


Abe left from the Gare Saint-Lazare at eleven—he stood alone under the fouled glass dome, relic of the seventies, era of the Crystal Palace; his hands, of that vague gray color that only twenty-four hours can produce, were in his coat pockets to conceal the trembling fingers. With his hat removed it was plain that only the top layer of his hair was brushed back—the lower levels were pointed resolutely sidewise. He was scarcely recognizable as the man who had swum upon Gausse’s Beach a fortnight ago.

He was early; he looked from left to right with his eyes only; it would have taken nervous forces out of his control to use any other part of his body. New-looking baggage went past him; presently prospective passengers, with dark little bodies, were calling:“Jew-uls-Hoo-oo!” in dark piercing voices.

At the minute when he wondered whether or not he had time for a drink at the buffet, and began clutching at the soggy wad of thousand-franc notes in his pocket, one end of his pendulous glance came to rest upon the apparition of Nicole at the stairhead. He watched her—she was self-revelatory in her little expressions as people seem to someone waiting for them, who as yet is himself unobserved. She was frowning, thinking of her children, less gloating over them than merely animally counting them—a cat checking her cubs with a paw.

When she saw Abe, the mood passed out of her face; the glow of the morning skylight was sad, and Abe made a gloomy figure with dark circles that showed through the crimson tan under his eyes. They sat down on a bench.

“I came because you asked me,” said Nicole defensively. Abe seemed to have forgotten why he asked her and Nicole was quite content to look at the travellers passing by.

“That’s going to be the belle of your boat—that one with all the men to say good-by—you see why she bought that dress?” Nicole talked faster and faster. “You see why nobody else would buy it except the belle of the world cruise? See? No? Wake up! That’s a story dress—that extra material tells a story and somebody on world cruise would be lonesome enough to want to hear it.”

She bit close her last words; she had talked too much for her; and Abe found it difficult to gather from her serious set face that she had spoken at all. With an effort he drew himself up to a posture that looked as if he were standing up while he was sitting down.

“The afternoon you took me to that funny ball—you know, St. Genevieve’s—” he began.

“I remember. It was fun, wasn’t it?”

“No fun for me. I haven’t had fun seeing you this time. I’m tired of you both, but it doesn’t show because you’re even more tired of me—you know what I mean. If I had any enthusiasm, I’d go on to new people.”

There was a rough nap on Nicole’s velvet gloves as she slapped him back:

“Seems rather foolish to be unpleasant, Abe. Anyhow you don’t mean that. I can’t see why you’ve given up about everything.”

Abe considered, trying hard not to cough or blow his nose.

“I suppose I got bored; and then it was such a long way to go back in order to get anywhere.”

Often a man can play the helpless child in front of a woman, but he can almost never bring it off when he feels most like a helpless child.

“No excuse for it,” Nicole said crisply.

Abe was feeling worse every minute—he could think of nothing but disagreeable and sheerly nervous remarks. Nicole thought that the correct attitude for her was to sit staring straight ahead, hands in her lap. For a while there was no communication between them—each was racing away from the other, breathing only insofar as there was blue space ahead, a sky not seen by the other. Unlike lovers they possessed no past; unlike man and wife, they possessed no future; yet up to this morning Nicole had liked Abe better than any one except Dick—and he had been heavy, belly-frightened, with love for her for years.

“Tired of women’s worlds,” he spoke up suddenly.

“Then why don’t you make a world of your own?”

“Tired of friends. The thing is to have sycophants.”

Nicole tried to force the minute hand around on the station clock, but, “You agree?” he demanded.

“I am a woman and my business is to hold things together.”

“My business is to tear them apart.”

“When you get drunk you don’t tear anything apart except yourself,” she said, cold now, and frightened and unconfident. The station was filling but no one she knew came. After a moment her eyes fell gratefully on a tall girl with straw hair like a helmet, who was dropping letters in the mail slot.

“A girl I have to speak to, Abe. Abe, wake up! You fool!”

Patiently Abe followed her with his eyes. The woman turned in a startled way to greet Nicole, and Abe recognized her as some one he had seen around Paris. He took advantage of Nicole’s absence to cough hard and retchingly into his handkerchief, and to blow his nose loud. The morning was warmer and his underwear was soaked with sweat. His fingers trembled so violently that it took four matches to light a cigarette; it seemed absolutely necessary to make his way into the buffet for a drink, but immediately Nicole returned.

“That was a mistake,” she said with frosty humor. “After begging me to come and see her, she gave me a good snubbing. She looked at me as if I were rotted.” Excited, she did a little laugh, as with two fingers high in the scales. “Let people come to you.”

Abe recovered from a cigarette cough and remarked:

“Trouble is when you’re sober you don’t want to see anybody, and when you’re tight nobody wants to see you.”

“Who, me?” Nicole laughed again; for some reason the late encounter had cheered her.

“No—me.”

“Speak for yourself. I like people, a lot of people—I like—”

Rosemary and Mary North came in sight, walking slowly and searching for Abe, and Nicole burst forth grossly with “Hey! Hi! Hey!”and laughed and waved the package of handkerchiefs she had bought for Abe.

They stood in an uncomfortable little group weighted down by Abe’s gigantic presence: he lay athwart them like the wreck of a galleon, dominating with his presence his own weakness and self-indulgence, his narrowness and bitterness. All of them were conscious of the solemn dignity that flowed from him, of his achievement, fragmentary, suggestive and surpassed. But they were frightened at his survivant will, once a will to live, now become a will to die.

Dick Diver came and brought with him a fine glowing surface on which the three women sprang like monkeys with cries of relief, perching on his shoulders, on the beautiful crown of his hat or the gold head of his cane. Now, for a moment, they could disregard the spectacle of Abe’s gigantic obscenity. Dick saw the situation quickly and grasped it quietly. He pulled them out of themselves into the station, making plain its wonders. Nearby, some Americans were saying good-by in voices that mimicked the cadence of water running into a large old bathtub. Standing in the station, with Paris in back of them, it seemed as if they were vicariously leaning a little over the ocean, already undergoing a sea-change, a shifting about of atoms to form the essential molecule of a new people.

So the well-to-do Americans poured through the station onto the platforms with frank new faces, intelligent, considerate, thoughtless, thought-for. An occasional English face among them seemed sharp and emergent. When there were enough Americans on the platform the first impression of their immaculacy and their money began to fade into a vague racial dusk that hindered and blinded both them and their observers.

Nicole seized Dick’s arm crying, “Look!” Dick turned in time to see what took place in half a minute. At a Pullman entrance two cars off, a vivid scene detached itself from the tenor of many farewells. The young woman with the helmet-like hair to whom Nicole had spoken made an odd dodging little run away from the man to whom she was talking and plunged a frantic hand into her purse; then the sound of two revolver shots cracked the narrow air of the platform. Simultaneously the engine whistled sharply and the train began to move, momentarily dwarfing the shots in significance. Abe waved again from his window, oblivious to what had happened. But before the crowd closed in, the others had seen the shots take effect, seen the target sit down upon the platform.

Only after a hundred years did the train stop; Nicole, Mary, and Rosemary waited on the outskirts while Dick fought his way through. It was five minutes before he found them again—by this time the crowd had split into two sections, following, respectively, the man on a stretcher and the girl walking pale and firm between distraught gendarmes.

“It was Maria Wallis,” Dick said hurriedly. “The man she shot was an Englishman—they had an awful time finding out who, because she shot him through his identification card.” They were walking quickly from the train, swayed along with the crowd. “I found out what poste de police they’re taking her to so I’ll go there—”

“But her sister lives in Paris,” Nicole objected. “Why not phone her? Seems very peculiar nobody thought of that. She’s married to a Frenchman, and he can do more than we can.”

Dick hesitated, shook his head and started off.

“Wait!” Nicole cried after him. “That’s foolish—how can you do any good—with your French?”

“At least I’ll see they don’t do anything outrageous to her.”

“They’re certainly going to hold on to her,” Nicole assured him briskly. “She did shoot the man. The best thing is to phone right away to Laura—she can do more than we can.”

Dick was unconvinced—also he was showing off for Rosemary.

“You wait,” said Nicole firmly, and hurried off to a telephone booth.

“When Nicole takes things into her hands,” he said with affectionate irony, “there is nothing more to be done.”

He saw Rosemary for the first time that morning. They exchanged glances, trying to recognize the emotions of the day before. For a moment each seemed unreal to the other—then the slow warm hum of love began again.

“You like to help everybody, don’t you?” Rosemary said.

“I only pretend to.”

“Mother likes to help everybody—of course she can’t help as many people as you do.” She sighed. “Sometimes I think I’m the most selfish person in the world.”

For the first time the mention of her mother annoyed rather than amused Dick. He wanted to sweep away her mother, remove the whole affair from the nursery footing upon which Rosemary persistently established it. But he realized that this impulse was a loss of control—what would become of Rosemary’s urge toward him if, for even a moment, he relaxed. He saw, not without panic, that the affair was sliding to rest; it could not stand still, it must go on or go back; for the first time it occurred to him that Rosemary had her hand on the lever more authoritatively than he.

Before he had thought out a course of procedure, Nicole returned.

“I found Laura. It was the first news she had and her voice kept fading away and then getting loud again—as if she was fainting and then pulling herself together. She said she knew something was going to happen this morning.”

“Maria ought to be with Diaghileff,” said Dick in a gentle tone, in order to bring them back to quietude. “She has a nice sense of decor—not to say rhythm. Will any of us ever see a train pulling out without hearing a few shots?”

They bumped down the wide steel steps. “I’m sorry for the poor man,” Nicole said. “Course that’s why she talked so strange to me—she was getting ready to open fire.”

She laughed, Rosemary laughed too, but they were both horrified, and both of them deeply wanted Dick to make a moral comment on the matter and not leave it to them. This wish was not entirely conscious, especially on the part of Rosemary, who was accustomed to having shell fragments of such events shriek past her head. But a totality of shock had piled up in her too. For the moment, Dick was too shaken by the impetus of his newly recognized emotion to resolve things into the pattern of the holiday, so the women, missing something, lapsed into a vague unhappiness.

Then, as if nothing had happened, the lives of the Divers and their friends flowed out into the street.

However, everything had happened—Abe’s departure and Mary’s impending departure for Salzburg this afternoon had ended the time in Paris. Or perhaps the shots, the concussions that had finished God knew what dark matter, had terminated it. The shots had entered into all their lives: echoes of violence followed them out onto the pavement where two porters held a post-mortem beside them as they waited for a taxi.

“Tu as vu le revolver? Il était très petite, vraie perle—un jouet.”

“Mais, assez puissant!” said the other porter sagely. “Tu as vu sa chemise? Assez de sang pour se croire à la guerre.”

In the square, as they came out, a suspended mass of gasoline exhaust cooked slowly in the July sun. It was a terrible thing—unlike pure heat it held no promise of rural escape but suggested only roads choked with the same foul asthma. During their luncheon, outdoors, across from the Luxembourg Gardens, Rosemary had cramps and felt fretful and full of impatient lassitude—it was the foretaste of this that had inspired her self-accusation of selfishness in the station.

Dick had no suspicion of the sharpness of the change; he was profoundly unhappy and the subsequent increase of egotism tended momentarily to blind him to what was going on round about him, and deprive him of the long ground-swell of imagination that he counted on for his judgments.

After Mary North left them, accompanied by the Italian singing teacher who had joined them for coffee and was taking her to her train, Rosemary, too, stood up, bound for an engagement at her studio:“meet some officials.”

“And oh—” she proposed “—if Collis Clay, that Southern boy—if he comes while you are still sitting here, just tell him I couldn’t wait; tell him to call me to-morrow.”

Too insouciant, in reaction from the late disturbance, she had assumed the privileges of a child—the result being to remind the Divers of their exclusive love for their own children; Rosemary was sharply rebuked in a short passage between the women:“You’d better leave the message with a waiter,” Nicole’s voice was stern and unmodulated, “we’re leaving immediately.”

Rosemary got it, took it without resentment.

“I’ll let it go then. Good-by, you darlings.”

Dick asked for the check; the Divers relaxed, chewing tentatively on toothpicks.

“Well—” they said together.

He saw a flash of unhappiness on her mouth, so brief that only he would have noticed, and he could pretend not to have seen. What did Nicole think? Rosemary was one of a dozen people he had “worked over” in the past years: these had included a French circus clown, Abe and Mary North, a pair of dancers, a writer, a painter, a comedienne from the Grand Guignol, a half-crazy pederast from the Russian Ballet, a promising tenor they had staked to a year in Milan. Nicole well knew how seriously these people interpreted his interest and enthusiasm; but she realized also that, except while their children were being born, Dick had not spent a night apart from her since their marriage. On the other hand, there was a pleasingness about him that simply had to be used—those who possessed that pleasingness had to keep their hands in, and go along attaching people that they had no use to make of.

Now Dick hardened himself and let minutes pass without making any gesture of confidence, any representation of constantly renewed surprise that they were one together.

Collis Clay out of the South edged a passage between the closely packed tables and greeted the Divers cavalierly. Such salutations always astonished Dick—acquaintances saying “Hi!” to them, or speaking only to one of them. He felt so intensely about people that in moments of apathy he preferred to remain concealed; that one could parade a casualness into his presence was a challenge to the key on which he lived.

Collis, unaware that he was without a wedding garment, heralded his arrival with:“I reckon I’m late—the beyed has flown.” Dick had to wrench something out of himself before he could forgive him for not having first complimented Nicole.

She left almost immediately and he sat with Collis, finishing the last of his wine. He rather liked Collis—he was “post-war;” less difficult than most of the Southerners he had known at New Haven a decade previously. Dick listened with amusement to the conversation that accompanied the slow, profound stuffing of a pipe. In the early afternoon children and nurses were trekking into the Luxembourg Gardens; it was the first time in months that Dick had let this part of the day out of his hands.

Suddenly his blood ran cold as he realized the content of Collis’s confidential monologue.

“—she’s not so cold as you’d probably think. I admit I thought she was cold for a long time. But she got into a jam with a friend of mine going from New York to Chicago at Easter—a boy named Hillis she thought was pretty nutsey at New Haven—she had a compartment with a cousin of mine but she and Hillis wanted to be alone, so in the afternoon my cousin came and played cards in our compartment. Well, after about two hours we went back and there was Rosemary and Bill Hillis standing in the vestibule arguing with the conductor—Rosemary white as a sheet. Seems they locked the door and pulled down the blinds and I guess there was some heavy stuff going on when the conductor came for the tickets and knocked on the door. They thought it was us kidding them and wouldn’t let him in at first, and when they did, he was plenty sore. He asked Hillis if that was his compartment and whether he and Rosemary were married that they locked the door, and Hillis lost his temper trying to explain there was nothing wrong. He said the conductor had insulted Rosemary and he wanted him to fight, but that conductor could have made trouble—and believe me I had an awful time smoothing it over.”

With every detail imagined, with even envy for the pair’s community of misfortune in the vestibule, Dick felt a change taking place within him. Only the image of a third person, even a vanished one, entering into his relation with Rosemary was needed to throw him off his balance and send through him waves of pain, misery, desire, desperation. The vividly pictured hand on Rosemary’s cheek, the quicker breath, the white excitement of the event viewed from outside, the inviolable secret warmth within.

—Do you mind if I pull down the curtain?

—Please do. It’s too light in here.

Collis Clay was now speaking about fraternity politics at New Haven, in the same tone, with the same emphasis. Dick had gathered that he was in love with Rosemary in some curious way Dick could not have understood. The affair with Hillis seemed to have made no emotional impression on Collis save to give him the joyful conviction that Rosemary was “human.”

“Bones got a wonderful crowd,” he said. “We all did, as a matter of fact. New Haven’s so big now the sad thing is the men we have to leave out.”

—Do you mind if I pull down the curtain?

—Please do. It’s too light in here.

…Dick went over Paris to his bank—writing a check, he looked along the row of men at the desks deciding to which one he would present it for an O.K. As he wrote he engrossed himself in the material act, examining meticulously the pen, writing laboriously upon the high glass-topped desk. Once he raised glazed eyes to look toward the mail department, then glazed his spirit again by concentration upon the objects he dealt with.

Still he failed to decide to whom the check should be presented, which man in the line would guess least of the unhappy predicament in which he found himself and, also, which one would be least likely to talk. There was Perrin, the suave New Yorker, who had asked him to luncheons at the American Club, there was Casasus, the Spaniard, with whom he usually discussed a mutual friend in spite of the fact that the friend had passed out of his life a dozen years before; there was Muchhause, who always asked him whether he wanted to draw upon his wife’s money or his own.

As he entered the amount on the stub, and drew two lines under it, he decided to go to Pierce, who was young and for whom he would have to put on only a small show. It was often easier to give a show than to watch one.

He went to the mail desk first—as the woman who served him pushed up with her bosom a piece of paper that had nearly escaped the desk, he thought how differently women use their bodies from men. He took his letters aside to open: There was a bill for seventeen psychiatric books from a German concern, a bill from Brentano’s, a letter from Buffalo from his father, in a handwriting that year by year became more indecipherable; there was a card from Tommy Barban postmarked Fez and bearing a facetious communication; there were letters from doctors in Zurich, both in German; a disputed bill from a plasterer in Cannes; a bill from a furniture maker; a letter from the publisher of a medical journal in Baltimore, miscellaneous announcements and an invitation to a showing of pictures by an incipient artist; also there were three letters for Nicole, and a letter for Rosemary sent in his care.

—Do you mind if I pull down the curtain?

He went toward Pierce but he was engaged with a woman, and Dick saw with his heels that he would have to present his check to Casasus at the next desk, who was free.

“How are you, Diver?” Casasus was genial. He stood up, his mustache spreading with his smile. “We were talking about Featherstone the other day and I thought of you—he’s out in California now.”

Dick widened his eyes and bent forward a little.

“In California?”

“That’s what I heard.”

Dick held the check poised; to focus the attention of Casasus upon it he looked toward Pierce’s desk, holding the latter for a moment in a friendly eye-play conditioned by an old joke of three years before when Pierce had been involved with a Lithuanian countess. Pierce played up with a grin until Casasus had authorized the check and had no further recourse to detain Dick, whom he liked, than to stand up holding his pince-nez and repeat, “Yes, he’s in California.”

Meanwhile Dick had seen that Perrin, at the head of the line of desks, was in conversation with the heavyweight champion of the world; from a sidesweep of Perrin’s eye Dick saw that he was considering calling him over and introducing him, but that he finally decided against it.

Cutting across the social mood of Casasus with the intensity he had accumulated at the glass desk—which is to say he looked hard at the check, studying it, and then fixed his eyes on grave problems beyond the first marble pillar to the right of the banker’s head and made a business of shifting the cane, hat, and letters he carried—he said good-by and went out. He had long ago purchased the doorman; his taxi sprang to the curb.

“I want to go to the Films Par Excellence Studio—it’s on a little street in Passy. Go to the Muette. I’ll direct you from there.”

He was rendered so uncertain by the events of the last forty-eight hours that he was not even sure of what he wanted to do; he paid off the taxi at the Muette and walked in the direction of the studio, crossing to the opposite side of the street before he came to the building. Dignified in his fine clothes, with their fine accessories, he was yet swayed and driven as an animal. Dignity could come only with an overthrowing of his past, of the effort of the last six years. He went briskly around the block with the fatuousness of one of Tarkington’s adolescents hurrying at the blind places lest he miss Rosemary’s coming out of the studio. It was a melancholy neighborhood. Next door to the place he saw a sign:“1000 chemises.” The shirts filled the window, piled, cravated, stuffed, or draped with shoddy grace on the showcase floor:“1000 chemises”—count them! On either side he read:“Papeterie,”“Pâtisserie,”“Solde,”“Réclame”—and Constance Talmadge in “Déjeuner de Soleil,” and farther away there were more sombre announcements:“Vêtements Ecclésiastiques,”“Déclaration de Décès” and “Pompes Funèbres.” Life and death.

He knew that what he was now doing marked a turning point in his life—it was out of line with everything that had preceded it—even out of line with what effect he might hope to produce upon Rosemary. Rosemary saw him always as a model of correctness—his presence walking around this block was an intrusion. But Dick’s necessity of behaving as he did was a projection of some submerged reality: he was compelled to walk there, or stand there, his shirt-sleeve fitting his wrist and his coat sleeve encasing his shirt-sleeve like a sleeve valve, his collar molded plastically to his neck, his red hair cut exactly, his hand holding his small briefcase like a dandy—just as another man once found it necessary to stand in front of a church in Ferrara, in sackcloth and ashes. Dick was paying some tribute to things unforgotten, unshriven, unexpurgated.





21


After three-quarters of an hour of standing around, he became suddenly involved in a human contact. It was just the sort of thing that was likely to happen to him when he was in the mood of not wanting to see any one. So rigidly did he sometimes guard his exposed self-consciousness that frequently he defeated his own purposes; as an actor who underplays a part sets up a craning forward, a stimulated emotional attention in an audience, and seems to create in others an ability to bridge the gap he has left open. Similarly we are seldom sorry for those who need and crave our pity—we reserve this for those who, by other means, make us exercise the abstract function of pity.

So Dick might, himself, have analyzed the incident that ensued. As he paced the rue des Saints Anges he was spoken to by a thin-faced American, perhaps thirty, with an air of being scarred and a slight but sinister smile. As Dick gave him the light he requested, he placed him as one of a type of which he had been conscious since early youth—a type that loafed about tobacco stores with one elbow on the counter and watched, through heaven knew what small chink of the mind, the people who came in and out. Intimate to garages, where he had vague business conducted in undertones, to barber shops, to the lobbies of theatres—in such places, at any rate, Dick placed him. Sometimes the face bobbed up in one of Tad’s more savage cartoons—in boyhood Dick had often thrown an uneasy glance at the dim borderland of crime on which he stood.

“How do you like Paris, Buddy?”

Not waiting for an answer the man tried to fit in his footsteps with Dick’s:“Where you from?” he asked encouragingly.

“From Buffalo.”

“I’m from San Antone—but I been over here since the war.”

“You in the army?”

“I’ll say I was. Eighty-fourth Division—ever heard of that outfit?”

The man walked a little ahead of him and fixed him with eyes that were practically menacing.

“Staying in Paris awhile, Buddy? Or just passing through?”

“Passing through.”

“What hotel you staying at?”

Dick had begun laughing to himself—the party had the intention of rifling his room that night. His thoughts were read apparently without self-consciousness.

“With a build like yours you oughtn’t to be afraid of me, Buddy. There’s a lot of bums around just laying for American tourists, but you needn’t be afraid of me.”

Becoming bored, Dick stopped walking:“I just wonder why you’ve got so much time to waste.”

“I’m in business here in Paris.”

“In what line?”

“Selling papers.”

The contrast between the formidable manner and the mild profession was absurd—but the man amended it with:

“Don’t worry; I made plenty money last year—ten or twenty francs for a Sunny Times that cost six.”

He produced a newspaper clipping from a rusty wallet and passed it over to one who had become a fellow stroller—the cartoon showed a stream of Americans pouring from the gangplank of a liner freighted with gold.

“Two hundred thousand—spending ten million a summer.”

“What you doing out here in Passy?”

His companion looked around cautiously. “Movies,” he said darkly.“They got an American studio over there. And they need guys can speak English. I’m waiting for a break.”

Dick shook him off quickly and firmly.

It had become apparent that Rosemary either had escaped on one of his early circuits of the block or else had left before he came into the neighborhood; he went into the bistro on the corner, bought a lead disk and, squeezed in an alcove between the kitchen and the foul toilet, he called the Roi George. He recognized Cheyne-Stokes tendencies in his respiration—but like everything the symptom served only to turn him in toward his emotion. He gave the number of the hotel; then stood holding the phone and staring into the café; after a long while a strange little voice said hello.

“This is Dick—I had to call you.”

A pause from her—then bravely, and in key with his emotion:“I’m glad you did.”

“I came to meet you at your studio—I’m out in Passy across the way from it. I thought maybe we’d ride around through the Bois.”

“Oh, I only stayed there a minute! I’m so sorry.” A silence.

“Rosemary.”

“Yes, Dick.”

“Look, I’m in an extraordinary condition about you. When a child can disturb a middle-aged gent—things get difficult.”

“You’re not middle-aged, Dick—you’re the youngest person in the world.”

“Rosemary?” Silence while he stared at a shelf that held the humbler poisons of France—bottles of Otard, Rhum St. James, Marie Brizzard, Punch Orangeade, Fernet Branca, Cherry Rocher, and Armagnac.

“Are you alone?”

—Do you mind if I pull down the curtain?

“Who do you think I’d be with?”

“That’s the state I’m in. I’d like to be with you now.”

Silence, then a sigh and an answer. “I wish you were with me now.”

There was the hotel room where she lay behind a telephone number, and little gusts of music wailed around her—

And two—for tea.

And me for you,

And you for me

Alow-own.

There was the remembered dust of powder over her tan—when he kissed her face it was damp around the corners of her hair; there was the flash of a white face under his own, the arc of a shoulder.

“It’s impossible,” he said to himself. In a minute he was out in the street marching along toward the Muette, or away from it, his small brief-case still in his hand, his gold-headed stick held at a sword-like angle.

Rosemary returned to her desk and finished a letter to her mother.

“—I only saw him for a little while but I thought he was wonderful looking. I fell in love with him (Of course I Do Love Dick Best but you know what I mean). He really is going to direct the picture and is leaving immediately for Hollywood, and I think we ought to leave, too. Collis Clay has been here. I like him all right but have not seen much of him because of the Divers, who really are divine, about the Nicest People I ever Knew. I am feeling not very well to-day and am taking the Medicine, though see No need for it. I’m not even Going to Try to tell you All that’s Happened until I see You!!! So when you get this letter wire, wire, wire! Are you coming north or shall I come south with the Divers?”

At six Dick called Nicole.

“Have you any special plans?” he asked. “Would you like to do something quiet—dinner at the hotel and then a play?”

“Would you? I’ll do whatever you want. I phoned Rosemary a while ago and she’s having dinner in her room. I think this upset all of us, don’t you?”

“It didn’t upset me,” he objected. “Darling, unless you’re physically tired let’s do something. Otherwise we’ll get south and spend a week wondering why we didn’t see Boucher. It’s better than brooding—”

This was a blunder and Nicole took him up sharply.

“Brooding about what?”

“About Maria Wallis.”

She agreed to go to a play. It was a tradition between them that they should never be too tired for anything, and they found it made the days better on the whole and put the evenings more in order. When, inevitably, their spirits flagged they shifted the blame to the weariness and fatigue of others. Before they went out, as fine-looking a couple as could be found in Paris, they knocked softly at Rosemary’s door. There was no answer; judging that she was asleep they walked into a warm strident Paris night, snatching a vermouth and bitters in the shadow by Fouquet’s bar.





22


Nicole awoke late, murmuring something back into her dream before she parted her long lashes tangled with sleep. Dick’s bed was empty—only after a minute did she realize that she had been awakened by a knock at their salon door.

“Entrez!” she called, but there was no answer, and after a moment she slipped on a dressing-gown and went to open it. A sergent de ville confronted her courteously and stepped inside the door.

“Mr. Afghan North—he is here?”

“What? No—he’s gone to America.”

“When did he leave, Madame?”

“Yesterday morning.”

He shook his head and waved his forefinger at her in a quicker rhythm.

“He was in Paris last night. He is registered here but his room is not occupied. They told me I had better ask at this room.”

“Sounds very peculiar to me—we saw him off yesterday morning on the boat train.”

“Be that as it may, he has been seen here this morning. Even his carte d’identité has been seen. And there you are.”

“We know nothing about it,” she proclaimed in amazement.

He considered. He was an ill-smelling, handsome man.

“You were not with him at all last night?”

“But no.”

“We have arrested a Negro. We are convinced we have at last arrested the correct Negro.”

“I assure you that I haven’t an idea what you’re talking about. If it’s the Mr. Abraham North, the one we know, well, if he was in Paris last night we weren’t aware of it.”

The man nodded, sucked his upper lip, convinced but disappointed.

“What happened?” Nicole demanded.

He showed his palms, puffing out his closed mouth. He had begun to find her attractive and his eyes flickered at her.

“What do you wish, Madame? A summer affair. Mr. Afghan North was robbed and he made a complaint. We have arrested the miscreant. Mr. Afghan should come to identify him and make the proper charges.”

Nicole pulled her dressing-gown closer around her and dismissed him briskly. Mystified she took a bath and dressed. By this time it was after ten and she called Rosemary but got no answer—then she phoned the hotel office and found that Abe had indeed registered, at six-thirty this morning. His room, however, was still unoccupied. Hoping for a word from Dick she waited in the parlor of the suite; just as she had given up and decided to go out, the office called and announced:

“Meestaire Crawshow, un nègre.”

“On what business?” she demanded.

“He says he knows you and the doctaire. He says there is a Meestaire Freeman into prison that is a friend of all the world. He says there is injustice and he wishes to see Meestaire North before he himself is arrested.”

“We know nothing about it.” Nicole disclaimed the whole business with a vehement clap of the receiver. Abe’s bizarre reappearance made it plain to her how fatigued she was with his dissipation. Dismissing him from her mind she went out, ran into Rosemary at the dressmaker’s, and shopped with her for artificial flowers and all-colored strings of colored beads on the rue de Rivoli. She helped Rosemary choose a diamond for her mother, and some scarfs and novel cigarette cases to take home to business associates in California. For her son she bought Greek and Roman soldiers, a whole army of them, costing over a thousand francs. Once again they spent their money in different ways, and again Rosemary admired Nicole’s method of spending. Nicole was sure that the money she spent was hers—Rosemary still thought her money was miraculously lent to her and she must consequently be very careful of it.

It was fun spending money in the sunlight of the foreign city with healthy bodies under them that sent streams of color up to their faces; with arms and hands, legs and ankles that they stretched out confidently, reaching or stepping with the confidence of women lovely to men.

When they got back to the hotel and found Dick, all bright and new in the morning, both of them had a moment of complete childish joy.

He had just received a garbled telephone call from Abe who so it appeared, had spent the forenoon in hiding.

“It was one of the most extraordinary telephone conversations I’ve ever held.”

Dick had talked not only to Abe but to a dozen others. On the phone these supernumeraries had been typically introduced as:“—man wants to talk to you is in the Teput Dome, well he says he was in it—what is it?

“Hey, somebody, shut-up—anyhow, he was in some shandel-scandal and he kaa possibly go home. My own personal is that—my personal is he’s had a—” Gulps sounded and thereafter what the party had, rested with the unknown.

The phone yielded up a supplementary offer:

“I thought it would appeal to you anyhow as a psychologist.” The vague personality who corresponded to this statement was eventually hung on to the phone; in the sequence he failed to appeal to Dick, as a psychologist, or indeed as anything else. Abe’s conversation flowed on as follows:

“Hello.”

“Well?”

“Well, hello.”

“Who are you?”

“Well.” There were interpolated snorts of laughter.

“Well, I’ll put somebody else on the line.”

Sometimes Dick could hear Abe’s voice, accompanied by scufflings, droppings of the receiver, far-away fragments such as, “No, I don’t, Mr. North….” Then a pert decided voice had said:“If you are a friend of Mr. North you will come down and take him away.”

Abe cut in, solemn and ponderous, beating it all down with an overtone of earth-bound determination.

“Dick, I’ve launched a race riot in Montmartre. I’m going over and get Freeman out of jail. If a Negro from Copenhagen that makes shoe polish—hello, can you hear me—well, look, if anybody comes there—” Once again the receiver was a chorus of innumerable melodies.

“Why you back in Paris?” Dick demanded.

“I got as far as Évreux, and I decided to take a plane back so I could compare it with St. Sulpice. I mean I don’t intend to bring St. Sulpice back to Paris. I don’t even mean Baroque! I meant St. Germain. For God’s sake, wait a minute and I’ll put the chasseur on the wire.”

“For God’s sake, don’t.”

“Listen—did Mary get off all right?”

“Yes.”

“Dick, I want you to talk with a man I met here this morning, the son of a naval officer that’s been to every doctor in Europe. Let me tell you about him—”

Dick had rung off at this point—perhaps that was a piece of ingratitude for he needed grist for the grinding activity of his mind.

“Abe used to be so nice,” Nicole told Rosemary. “So nice. Long ago—when Dick and I were first married. If you had known him then. He’d come to stay with us for weeks and weeks and we scarcely knew he was in the house. Sometimes he’d play—sometimes he’d be in the library with a muted piano, making love to it by the hour—Dick, do you remember that maid? She thought he was a ghost and sometimes Abe used to meet her in the hall and moo at her, and it cost us a whole tea service once—but we didn’t care.”

So much fun—so long ago. Rosemary envied them their fun, imagining a life of leisure unlike her own. She knew little of leisure but she had the respect for it of those who have never had it. She thought of it as a resting, without realizing that the Divers were as far from relaxing as she was herself.

“What did this to him?” she asked. “Why does he have to drink?”

Nicole shook her head right and left, disclaiming responsibility for the matter:“So many smart men go to pieces nowadays.”

“And when haven’t they?” Dick asked. “Smart men play close to the line because they have to—some of them can’t stand it, so they quit.”

“It must lie deeper than that.” Nicole clung to her conversation; also she was irritated that Dick should contradict her before Rosemary. “Artists like—well, like Fernand don’t seem to have to wallow in alcohol. Why is it just Americans who dissipate?”

There were so many answers to this question that Dick decided to leave it in the air, to buzz victoriously in Nicole’s ears. He had become intensely critical of her. Though he thought she was the most attractive human creature he had ever seen, though he got from her everything he needed, he scented battle from afar, and subconsciously he had been hardening and arming himself, hour by hour. He was not given to self-indulgence and he felt comparatively graceless at this moment of indulging himself, blinding his eyes with the hope that Nicole guessed at only an emotional excitement about Rosemary. He was not sure—last night at the theatre she had referred pointedly to Rosemary as a child.

The trio lunched downstairs in an atmosphere of carpets and padded waiters, who did not march at the stomping quick-step of those men who brought good food to the tables whereon they had recently dined. Here there were families of Americans staring around at families of Americans, and trying to make conversation with one another.

There was a party at the next table that they could not account for. It consisted of an expansive, somewhat secretarial, would-you-mind-repeating young man, and a score of women. The women were neither young nor old nor of any particular social class; yet the party gave the impression of a unit, held more closely together for example than a group of wives stalling through a professional congress of their husbands. Certainly it was more of a unit than any conceivable tourist party.

An instinct made Dick suck back the grave derision that formed on his tongue; he asked the waiter to find out who they were.

“Those are the gold-star muzzers,” explained the waiter.

Aloud and in low voices they exclaimed. Rosemary’s eyes filled with tears.

“Probably the young ones are the wives,” said Nicole.

Over his wine Dick looked at them again; in their happy faces, the dignity that surrounded and pervaded the party, he perceived all the maturity of an older America. For a while the sobered women who had come to mourn for their dead, for something they could not repair, made the room beautiful. Momentarily, he sat again on his father’s knee, riding with Mosby while the old loyalties and devotions fought on around him. Almost with an effort he turned back to his two women at the table and faced the whole new world in which he believed.

—Do you mind if I pull down the curtain?





23


Abe North was still in the Ritz bar, where he had been since nine in the morning. When he arrived seeking sanctuary the windows were open and great beams were busy at pulling up the dust from smoky carpets and cushions. Chasseurs tore through the corridors, liberated and disembodied, moving for the moment in pure space. The sit-down bar for women, across from the bar proper, seemed very small—it was hard to imagine what throngs it could accommodate in the afternoon.

The famous Paul, the concessionaire, had not arrived, but Claude, who was checking stock, broke off his work with no improper surprise to make Abe a pick-me-up. Abe sat on a bench against a wall. After two drinks he began to feel better—so much better that he mounted to the barber’s shop and was shaved. When he returned to the bar Paul had arrived—in his custom-built motor, from which he had disembarked correctly at the Boulevard des Capucines. Paul liked Abe and came over to talk.

“I was supposed to ship home this morning,” Abe said. “I mean yesterday morning, or whatever this is.”

“Why din you?” asked Paul.

Abe considered, and happened finally to a reason:“I was reading a serial in Liberty and the next installment was due here in Paris—so if I’d sailed I’d have missed it—then I never would have read it.”

“It must be a very good story.”

“It’s a terr-r-rible story.”

Paul arose chuckling and paused, leaning on the back of a chair:

“If you really want to get off, Mr. North, there are friends of yours going to-morrow on the France—Mister what is this name—and Slim Pearson. Mister—I’ll think of it—tall with a new beard.”

“Yardly,” Abe supplied.

“Mr. Yardly. They’re both going on the France.”

He was on his way to his duties but Abe tried to detain him:“If I didn’t have to go by way of Cherbourg. The baggage went that way.”

“Get your baggage in New York,” said Paul, receding.

The logic of the suggestion fitted gradually into Abe’s pitch—he grew rather enthusiastic about being cared for, or rather of prolonging his state of irresponsibility.

Other clients had meanwhile drifted in to the bar: first came a huge Dane whom Abe had somewhere encountered. The Dane took a seat across the room, and Abe guessed he would be there all the day, drinking, lunching, talking or reading newspapers. He felt a desire to out-stay him. At eleven the college boys began to step in, stepping gingerly lest they tear one another bag from bag. It was about then he had the chasseur telephone to the Divers; by the time he was in touch with them he was in touch also with other friends—and his hunch was to put them all on different phones at once—the result was somewhat general. From time to time his mind reverted to the fact that he ought to go over and get Freeman out of jail, but he shook off all facts as parts of the nightmare.

By one o’clock the bar was jammed; amidst the consequent mixture of voices the staff of waiters functioned, pinning down their clients to the facts of drink and money.

“That makes two stingers… and one more… two martinis and one… nothing for you, Mr. Quarterly… that makes three rounds. That makes seventy-five francs, Mr. Quarterly. Mr. Schaeffer said he had this—you had the last… I can only do what you say… thanks vera-much.”

In the confusion Abe had lost his seat; now he stood gently swaying and talking to some of the people with whom he had involved himself. A terrier ran a leash around his legs but Abe managed to extricate himself without upsetting and became the recipient of profuse apologies. Presently he was invited to lunch, but declined. It was almost Briglith, he explained, and there was something he had to do at Briglith. A little later, with the exquisite manners of the alcoholic that are like the manners of a prisoner or a family servant, he said good-by to an acquaintance, and turning around discovered that the bar’s great moment was over as precipitately as it had begun.

Across from him the Dane and his companions had ordered luncheon. Abe did likewise but scarcely touched it. Afterwards, he just sat, happy to live in the past. The drink made past happy things contemporary with the present, as if they were still going on, contemporary even with the future as if they were about to happen again.

At four the chasseur approached him:

“You wish to see a colored fellow of the name Jules Peterson?”

“God! How did he find me?”

“I didn’t tell him you were present.”

“Who did?” Abe fell over his glasses but recovered himself.

“Says he’s already been around to all the American bars and hotels.”

“Tell him I’m not here—” As the chasseur turned away Abe asked:“Can he come in here?”

“I’ll find out.”

Receiving the question Paul glanced over his shoulder; he shook his head, then seeing Abe he came over.

“I’m sorry; I can’t allow it.”

Abe got himself up with an effort and went out to the rue Cambon.





24


With his miniature leather brief-case in his hand Richard Diver walked from the seventh arrondisement—where he left a note for Maria Wallis signed “Dicole,” the word with which he and Nicole had signed communications in the first days of love—to his shirt-makers where the clerks made a fuss over him out of proportion to the money he spent. Ashamed at promising so much to these poor Englishmen, with his fine manners, his air of having the key to security, ashamed of making a tailor shift an inch of silk on his arm. Afterward he went to the bar of the Crillon and drank a small coffee and two fingers of gin.

As he entered the hotel the halls had seemed unnaturally bright; when he left he realized that it was because it had already turned dark outside. It was a windy four-o’clock night with the leaves on the Champs-Élysées singing and failing, thin and wild. Dick turned down the rue de Rivoli, walking two squares under the arcades to his bank where there was mail. Then he took a taxi and started up the Champs-Élysées through the first patter of rain, sitting alone with his love.

Back at two o’clock in the Roi George corridor the beauty of Nicole had been to the beauty of Rosemary as the beauty of Leonardo’s girl was to that of the girl of an illustrator. Dick moved on through the rain, demoniac and frightened, the passions of many men inside him and nothing simple that he could see.

Rosemary opened her door full of emotions no one else knew of. She was now what is sometimes called a “little wild thing”—by twenty-four full hours she was not yet unified and she was absorbed in playing around with chaos; as if her destiny were a picture puzzle—counting benefits, counting hopes, telling off Dick, Nicole, her mother, the director she met yesterday, like stops on a string of beads.

When Dick knocked she had just dressed and been watching the rain, thinking of some poem, and of full gutters in Beverly Hills. When she opened the door she saw him as something fixed and Godlike as he had always been, as older people are to younger, rigid and unmalleable. Dick saw her with an inevitable sense of disappointment. It took him a moment to respond to the unguarded sweetness of her smile, her body calculated to a millimeter to suggest a bud yet guarantee a flower. He was conscious of the print of her wet foot on a rug through the bathroom door.

“Miss Television,” he said with a lightness he did not feel. He put his gloves, his brief-case on the dressing-table, his stick against the wall. His chin dominated the lines of pain around his mouth, forcing them up into his forehead and the corner of his eyes, like fear that cannot be shown in public.

“Come and sit on my lap close to me,” he said softly, “and let me see about your lovely mouth.”

She came over and sat there and while the dripping slowed down outside—drip—dri-i-ip, she laid her lips to the beautiful cold image she had created.

Presently she kissed him several times in the mouth, her face getting big as it came up to him; he had never seen anything so dazzling as the quality of her skin, and since sometimes beauty gives back the images of one’s best thoughts he thought of his responsibility about Nicole, and of the responsibility of her being two doors down across the corridor.

“The rain’s over,” he said. “Do you see the sun on the slate?”

Rosemary stood up and leaned down and said her most sincere thing to him:

“Oh, we’re such actors—you and I.”

She went to her dresser and the moment that she laid her comb flat against her hair there was a slow persistent knocking at the door.

They were shocked motionless; the knock was repeated insistently, and in the sudden realization that the door was not locked Rosemary finished her hair with one stroke, nodded at Dick who had quickly jerked the wrinkles out of the bed where they had been sitting, and started for the door. Dick said in quite a natural voice, not too loud:

“—so if you don’t feel up to going out, I’ll tell Nicole and we’ll have a very quiet last evening.”

The precautions were needless for the situation of the parties outside the door was so harassed as to preclude any but the most fleeting judgments on matters not pertinent to themselves. Standing there was Abe, aged by several months in the last twenty-four hours, and a very frightened, concerned colored man whom Abe introduced as Mr. Peterson of Stockholm.

“He’s in a terrible situation and it’s my fault,” said Abe. “We need some good advice.”

“Come in our rooms,” said Dick.

Abe insisted that Rosemary come too and they crossed the hall to the Divers’ suite. Jules Peterson, a small, respectable Negro, on the suave model that heels the Republican party in the border States, followed.

It appeared that the latter had been a legal witness to the early morning dispute in Montparnasse; he had accompanied Abe to the police station and supported his assertion that a thousand-franc note had been seized out of his hand by a Negro, whose identification was one of the points of the case. Abe and Jules Peterson, accompanied by an agent of police, returned to the bistro and too hastily identified as the criminal a Negro, who, so it was established after an hour, had only entered the place after Abe left. The police had further complicated the situation by arresting the prominent Negro restaurateur, Freeman, who had only drifted through the alcoholic fog at a very early stage and then vanished. The true culprit, whose case, as reported by his friends, was that he had merely commandeered a fifty-franc note to pay for drinks that Abe had ordered, had only recently and in a somewhat sinister rôle, reappeared upon the scene.

In brief, Abe had succeeded in the space of an hour in entangling himself with the personal lives, consciences, and emotions of one Afro-European and three Afro-Americans inhabiting the Latin quarter. The disentanglement was not even faintly in sight and the day had passed in an atmosphere of unfamiliar Negro faces bobbing up in unexpected places and around unexpected corners, and insistent Negro voices on the phone.

In person, Abe had succeeded in evading all of them, save Jules Peterson. Peterson was rather in the position of the friendly Indian who had helped a white. The Negroes who suffered from the betrayal were not so much after Abe as after Peterson, and Peterson was very much after what protection he might get from Abe.

Up in Stockholm Peterson had failed as a small manufacturer of shoe polish and now possessed only his formula and sufficient trade tools to fill a small box; however, his new protector had promised in the early hours to set him up in business in Versailles. Abe’s former chauffeur was a shoemaker there and Abe had handed Peterson two hundred francs on account.

Rosemary listened with distaste to this rigmarole; to appreciate its grotesquerie required a more robust sense of humor than hers. The little man with his portable manufactory, his insincere eyes that, from time to time, rolled white semicircles of panic into view; the figure of Abe, his face as blurred as the gaunt fine lines of it would permit—all this was as remote from her as sickness.

“I ask only a chance in life,” said Peterson with the sort of precise yet distorted intonation peculiar to colonial countries. “My methods are simple, my formula is so good that I was drove away from Stockholm, ruined, because I did not care to dispose of it.”

Dick regarded him politely—interest formed, dissolved, he turned to Abe:

“You go to some hotel and go to bed. After you’re all straight Mr. Peterson will come and see you.”

“But don’t you appreciate the mess that Peterson’s in?” Abe protested.

“I shall wait in the hall,” said Mr. Peterson with delicacy. “It is perhaps hard to discuss my problems in front of me.”

He withdrew after a short travesty of a French bow; Abe pulled himself to his feet with the deliberation of a locomotive.

“I don’t seem highly popular to-day.”

“Popular but not probable,” Dick advised him. “My advice is to leave this hotel—by way of the bar, if you want. Go to the Chambord, or if you’ll need a lot of service, go over to the Majestic.”

“Could I annoy you for a drink?”

“There’s not a thing up here,” Dick lied.

Resignedly Abe shook hands with Rosemary; he composed his face slowly, holding her hand a long time and forming sentences that did not emerge.

“You are the most—one of the most—”

She was sorry, and rather revolted at his dirty hands, but she laughed in a well-bred way, as though it were nothing unusual to her to watch man walking in a slow dream. Often people display a curious respect for a man drunk, rather like the respect of simple races for the insane. Respect rather than fear. There is something awe-inspiring in one who has lost all inhibitions, who will do anything. Of course we make him pay afterward for his moment of superiority, his moment of impressiveness. Abe turned to Dick with a last appeal.

“If I go to a hotel and get all steamed and curry-combed, and sleep awhile, and fight off these Senegalese—could I come and spend the evening by the fireside?”

Dick nodded at him, less in agreement than in mockery and said:“You have a high opinion of your current capacities.”

“I bet if Nicole was here she’d let me come back.”

“All right.” Dick went to a trunk tray and brought a box to the central table; inside were innumerable cardboard letters.

“You can come if you want to play anagrams.”

Abe eyed the contents of the box with physical revulsion, as though he had been asked to eat them like oats.

“What are anagrams? Haven’t I had enough strange—”

“It’s a quiet game. You spell words with them—any word except alcohol.”

“I bet you can spell alcohol,” Abe plunged his hand among the counters. “Can I come back if I can spell alcohol?”

“You can come back if you want to play anagrams.”

Abe shook his head resignedly.

“If you’re in that frame of mind there’s no use—I’d just be in the way.” He waved his finger reproachfully at Dick. “But remember what George the third said, that if Grant was drunk he wished he would bite the other generals.”

With a last desperate glance at Rosemary from the golden corners of his eyes, he went out. To his relief Peterson was no longer in the corridor. Feeling lost and homeless he went back to ask Paul the name of that boat.





25


When he had tottered out, Dick and Rosemary embraced fleetingly. There was a dust of Paris over both of them through which they scented each other: the rubber guard on Dick’s fountain pen, the faintest odor of warmth from Rosemary’s neck and shoulders. For another half-minute Dick clung to the situation; Rosemary was first to return to reality.

“I must go, youngster,” she said.

They blinked at each other across a widening space, and Rosemary made an exit that she had learned young, and on which no director had ever tried to improve.

She opened the door of her room and went directly to her desk where she had suddenly remembered leaving her wristwatch. It was there; slipping it on she glanced down at the daily letter to her mother, finishing the last sentence in her mind. Then, rather gradually, she realized without turning about that she was not alone in the room.

In an inhabited room there are refracting objects only half noticed: varnished wood, more or less polished brass, silver and ivory, and beyond these a thousand conveyers of light and shadow so mild that one scarcely thinks of them as that, the tops of picture-frames, the edges of pencils or ash-trays, of crystal or china ornaments; the totality of this refraction—appealing to equally subtle reflexes of the vision as well as to those associational fragments in the subconscious that we seem to hang on to, as a glass-fitter keeps the irregularly shaped pieces that may do some time—this fact might account for what Rosemary afterward mystically described as “realizing” that there was some one in the room, before she could determine it. But when she did realize it she turned swift in a sort of ballet step and saw that a dead Negro was stretched upon her bed.

As she cried “aaouu!” and her still unfastened wristwatch banged against the desk she had the preposterous idea that it was Abe North. Then she dashed for the door and across the hall.

Dick was straightening up; he had examined the gloves worn that day and thrown them into a pile of soiled gloves in a corner of a trunk. He had hung up coat and vest and spread his shirt on another hanger—a trick of his own. “You’ll wear a shirt that’s a little dirty where you won’t wear a mussed shirt.” Nicole had come in and was dumping one of Abe’s extraordinary ash-trays into the waste-basket when Rosemary tore into the room.

“Dick! Dick! Come and see!”

Dick jogged across the hall into her room. He knelt to Peterson’s heart, and felt the pulse—the body was warm, the face, harassed and indirect in life, was gross and bitter in death; the box of materials was held under one arm but the shoe that dangled over the bedside was bare of polish and its sole was worn through. By French law Dick had no right to touch the body but he moved the arm a little to see something—there was a stain on the green coverlet, there would be faint blood on the blanket beneath.

Dick closed the door and stood thinking; he heard cautious steps in the corridor and then Nicole calling him by name. Opening the door he whispered:“Bring the couverture and top blanket from one of our beds—don’t let any one see you.” Then, noticing the strained look on her face, he added quickly, “Look here, you mustn’t get upset over this—it’s only some nigger scrap.”

“I want it to be over.”

The body, as Dick lifted it, was light and ill-nourished. He held it so that further hemorrhages from the wound would flow into the man’s clothes. Laying it beside the bed he stripped off the coverlet and top blanket and then opening the door an inch, listened—there was a clank of dishes down the hall followed by a loud patronizing “Merci, Madame,” but the waiter went in the other direction, toward the service stairway. Quickly Dick and Nicole exchanged bundles across the corridor; after spreading this covering on Rosemary’s bed, Dick stood sweating in the warm twilight, considering. Certain points had become apparent to him in the moment following his examination of the body; first, that Abe’s first hostile Indian had tracked the friendly Indian and discovered him in the corridor, and when the latter had taken desperate refuge in Rosemary’s room, had hunted down and slain him; second, that if the situation were allowed to develop naturally, no power on earth could keep the smear off Rosemary—the paint was scarcely dry on the Arbuckle case. Her contract was contingent upon an obligation to continue rigidly and unexceptionally as “Daddy’s Girl.”

Automatically Dick made the old motion of turning up his sleeves though he wore a sleeveless undershirt, and bent over the body. Getting a purchase on the shoulders of the coat he kicked open the door with his heel, and dragged the body quickly into a plausible position in the corridor. He came back into Rosemary’s room and smoothed back the grain of the plush floor rug. Then he went to the phone in his suite and called the manager-owner of the hotel.

“McBeth?—it’s Doctor Diver speaking—something very important. Are we on a more or less private line?”

It was good that he had made the extra effort which had firmly entrenched him with Mr. McBeth. Here was one use for all the pleasingness that Dick had expended over a large area he would never retrace….

“Going out of the suite we came on a dead Negro… in the hall… no, no, he’s a civilian. Wait a minute now—I knew you didn’t want any guests to blunder on the body so I’m phoning you. Of course I must ask you to keep my name out of it. I don’t want any French red tape just because I discovered the man.”

What exquisite consideration for the hotel! Only because Mr. McBeth, with his own eyes, had seen these traits in Doctor Diver two nights before, could he credit the story without question.

In a minute Mr. McBeth arrived and in another minute he was joined by a gendarme. In the interval he found time to whisper to Dick, “You can be sure the name of any guest will be protected. I’m only too grateful to you for your pains.”

Mr. McBeth took an immediate step that may only be imagined, but that influenced the gendarme so as to make him pull his mustaches in a frenzy of uneasiness and greed. He made perfunctory notes and sent a telephone call to his post. Meanwhile with a celerity that Jules Peterson, as a business man, would have quite understood, the remains were carried into another apartment of one of the most fashionable hotels in the world.

Dick went back to his salon.

“What happened?” cried Rosemary. “Do all the Americans in Paris just shoot at each other all the time?”

“This seems to be the open season,” he answered. “Where’s Nicole?”

“I think she’s in the bathroom.”

She adored him for saving her—disasters that could have attended upon the event had passed in prophecy through her mind; and she had listened in wild worship to his strong, sure, polite voice making it all right. But before she reached him in a sway of soul and body his attention focussed on something else: he went into the bedroom and toward the bathroom. And now Rosemary, too, could hear, louder and louder, a verbal inhumanity that penetrated the keyholes and the cracks in the doors, swept into the suite and in the shape of horror took form again.

With the idea that Nicole had fallen in the bathroom and hurt herself, Rosemary followed Dick. That was not the condition of affairs at which she stared before Dick shouldered her back and brusquely blocked her view.

Nicole knelt beside the tub swaying sidewise and sidewise. “It’s you!” she cried, “—it’s you come to intrude on the only privacy I have in the world—with your spread with red blood on it. I’ll wear it for you—I’m not ashamed, though it was such a pity. On All Fools Day we had a party on the Zürichsee, and all the fools were there, and I wanted to come dressed in a spread but they wouldn’t let me—”

“Control yourself!”

“—so I sat in the bathroom and they brought me a domino and said wear that. I did. What else could I do?”

“Control yourself, Nicole!”

“I never expected you to love me—it was too late—only don’t come in the bathroom, the only place I can go for privacy, dragging spreads with red blood on them and asking me to fix them.”

“Control yourself. Get up—”

Rosemary, back in the salon, heard the bathroom door bang, and stood trembling: now she knew what Violet McKisco had seen in the bathroom at Villa Diana. She answered the ringing phone and almost cried with relief when she found it was Collis Clay, who had traced her to the Divers’ apartment. She asked him to come up while she got her hat, because she was afraid to go into her room alone.





Book II


1


In the spring of 1917, when Doctor Richard Diver first arrived in Zurich, he was twenty-six years old, a fine age for a man, indeed the very acme of bachelorhood. Even in war-time days, it was a fine age for Dick, who was already too valuable, too much of a capital investment to be shot off in a gun. Years later it seemed to him that even in this sanctuary he did not escape lightly, but about that he never fully made up his mind—in 1917 he laughed at the idea, saying apologetically that the war didn’t touch him at all. Instructions from his local board were that he was to complete his studies in Zurich and take a degree as he had planned.

Switzerland was an island, washed on one side by the waves of thunder around Gorizia and on another by the cataracts along the Somme and the Aisne. For once there seemed more intriguing strangers than sick ones in the cantons, but that had to be guessed at—the men who whispered in the little cafés of Berne and Geneva were as likely to be diamond salesmen or commercial travellers. However, no one had missed the long trains of blinded or one-legged men, or dying trunks, that crossed each other between the bright lakes of Constance and Neuchâtel. In the beer-halls and shop-windows were bright posters presenting the Swiss defending their frontiers in 1914—with inspiring ferocity young men and old men glared down from the mountains at phantom French and Germans; the purpose was to assure the Swiss heart that it had shared the contagious glory of those days. As the massacre continued the posters withered away, and no country was more surprised than its sister republic when the United States bungled its way into the war.

Doctor Diver had seen around the edges of the war by that time: he was an Oxford Rhodes Scholar from Connecticut in 1914. He returned home for a final year at Johns Hopkins, and took his degree. In 1916 he managed to get to Vienna under the impression that, if he did not make haste, the great Freud would eventually succumb to an aeroplane bomb. Even then Vienna was old with death but Dick managed to get enough coal and oil to sit in his room in the Damenstiftgasse and write the pamphlets that he later destroyed, but that, rewritten, were the backbone of the book he published in Zurich in 1920.

Most of us have a favorite, a heroic period, in our lives and that was Dick Diver’s. For one thing he had no idea that he was charming, that the affection he gave and inspired was anything unusual among healthy people. In his last year at New Haven some one referred to him as “lucky Dick”—the name lingered in his head.

“Lucky Dick, you big stiff,” he would whisper to himself, walking around the last sticks of flame in his room. “You hit it, my boy. Nobody knew it was there before you came along.”

At the beginning of 1917, when it was becoming difficult to find coal, Dick burned for fuel almost a hundred textbooks that he had accumulated; but only, as he laid each one on the fire, with an assurance chuckling inside him that he was himself a digest of what was within the book, that he could brief it five years from now, if it deserved to be briefed. This went on at any odd hour, if necessary, with a floor rug over his shoulders, with the fine quiet of the scholar which is nearest of all things to heavenly peace—but which, as will presently be told, had to end.

For its temporary continuance he thanked his body that had done the flying rings at New Haven, and now swam in the winter Danube. With Elkins, second secretary at the Embassy, he shared an apartment, and there were two nice girl visitors—which was that and not too much of it, nor too much of the Embassy either. His contact with Ed Elkins aroused in him a first faint doubt as to the quality of his mental processes; he could not feel that they were profoundly different from the thinking of Elkins—Elkins, who would name you all the quarterbacks in New Haven for thirty years.

“—And Lucky Dick can’t be one of these clever men; he must be less intact, even faintly destroyed. If life won’t do it for him it’s not a substitute to get a disease, or a broken heart, or an inferiority complex, though it’d be nice to build out some broken side till it was better than the original structure.”

He mocked at his reasoning, calling it specious and “American”—his criteria of uncerebral phrase-making was that it was American. He knew, though, that the price of his intactness was incompleteness.

“The best I can wish you, my child,” so said the Fairy Blackstick in Thackeray’s The Rose and the Ring, “is a little misfortune.”

In some moods he griped at his own reasoning: Could I help it that Pete Livingstone sat in the locker-room Tap Day when everybody looked all over hell for him? And I got an election when otherwise I wouldn’t have got Elihu, knowing so few men. He was good and right and I ought to have sat in the locker-room instead. Maybe I would, if I’d thought I had a chance at an election. But Mercer kept coming to my room all those weeks. I guess I knew I had a chance all right, all right. But it would have served me right if I’d swallowed my pin in the shower and set up a conflict.

After the lectures at the university he used to argue this point with a young Rumanian intellectual who reassured him:“There’s no evidence that Goethe ever had a ‘conflict’ in the modern sense, or a man like Jung, for instance. You’re not a romantic philosopher—you’re a scientist. Memory, force, character—especially good sense. That’s going to be your trouble—judgment about yourself. Once I knew a man who worked two years on the brain of an armadillo, with the idea that he would sooner or later know more about the brain of an armadillo than any one. I kept arguing with him that he was not really pushing out the extension of the human range—it was too arbitrary. And sure enough, when he sent his work to the medical journal they refused it—they had just accepted a thesis by another man on the same subject.”

Dick got up to Zurich on less Achilles’ heels than would be required to equip a centipede, but with plenty—the illusions of eternal strength and health, and of the essential goodness of people; illusions of a nation, the lies of generations of frontier mothers who had to croon falsely that there were no wolves outside the cabin door. After he took his degree, he received his orders to join a neurological unit forming in Bar-sur-Aube.

In France, to his disgust, the work was executive rather than practical. In compensation he found time to complete the short textbook and assemble the material for his next venture. He returned to Zurich in the spring of 1919 discharged.

The foregoing has the ring of a biography, without the satisfaction of knowing that the hero, like Grant, lolling in his general store in Galena, is ready to be called to an intricate destiny. Moreover it is confusing to come across a youthful photograph of some one known in a rounded maturity and gaze with a shock upon a fiery, wiry, eagle-eyed stranger. Best to be reassuring—Dick Diver’s moment now began.





2


It was a damp April day, with long diagonal clouds over the Albishorn and water inert in the low places. Zurich is not unlike an American city. Missing something ever since his arrival two days before, Dick perceived that it was the sense he had had in finite French lanes that there was nothing more. In Zurich there was a lot besides Zurich—the roofs upled the eyes to tinkling cow pastures, which in turn modified hilltops further up—so life was a perpendicular starting off to a postcard heaven. The Alpine lands, home of the toy and the funicular, the merry-go-round and the thin chime, were not a being here, as in France with French vines growing over one’s feet on the ground.

In Salzburg once Dick had felt the superimposed quality of a bought and borrowed century of music; once in the laboratories of the University in Zurich, delicately poking at the cervical of a brain, he had felt like a toy-maker rather than like the tornado who had hurried through the old red buildings of Hopkins, two years before, unstayed by the irony of the gigantic Christ in the entrance hall.

Yet he had decided to remain another two years in Zurich, for he did not underestimate the value of toy-making, of infinite precision, of infinite patience.

To-day he went out to see Franz Gregorovious at Dohmler’s clinic on the Zürichsee. Franz, resident pathologist at the clinic, a Vaudois by birth, a few years older than Dick, met him at the tram stop. He had a dark and magnificent aspect of Cagliostro about him, contrasted with holy eyes; he was the third of the Gregoroviouses—his grandfather had instructed Kraepelin when psychiatry was just emerging from the darkness of all time. In personality he was proud, fiery, and sheep-like—he fancied himself as a hypnotist. If the original genius of the family had grown a little tired, Franz would without doubt become a fine clinician.

On the way to the clinic he said:“Tell me of your experiences in the war. Are you changed like the rest? You have the same stupid and unaging American face, except I know you’re not stupid, Dick.”

“I didn’t see any of the war—you must have gathered that from my letters, Franz.”

“That doesn’t matter—we have some shell-shocks who merely heard an air raid from a distance. We have a few who merely read newspapers.”

“It sounds like nonsense to me.”

“Maybe it is, Dick. But, we’re a rich person’s clinic—we don’t use the word nonsense. Frankly, did you come down to see me or to see that girl?”

They looked sideways at each other; Franz smiled enigmatically.

“Naturally I saw all the first letters,” he said in his official basso.“When the change began, delicacy prevented me from opening any more. Really it had become your case.”

“Then she’s well?” Dick demanded.

“Perfectly well, I have charge of her, in fact I have charge of the majority of the English and American patients. They call me Doctor Gregory.”

“Let me explain about that girl,” Dick said. “I only saw her one time, that’s a fact. When I came out to say good-by to you just before I went over to France. It was the first time I put on my uniform and I felt very bogus in it—went around saluting private soldiers and all that.”

“Why didn’t you wear it to-day?”

“Hey! I’ve been discharged three weeks. Here’s the way I happened to see that girl. When I left you I walked down toward that building of yours on the lake to get my bicycle.”

“Toward the Cedars?”

“—a wonderful night, you know—moon over that mountain—”

“The Krenzegg.”

“—I caught up with a nurse and a young girl. I didn’t think the girl was a patient; I asked the nurse about tram times and we walked along. The girl was about the prettiest thing I ever saw.”

“She still is.”

“She’d never seen an American uniform and we talked, and I didn’t think anything about it.” He broke off, recognizing a familiar perspective, and then resumed:“—except, Franz, I’m not as hard-boiled as you are yet; when I see a beautiful shell like that I can’t help feeling a regret about what’s inside it. That was absolutely all—till the letters began to come.”

“It was the best thing that could have happened to her,” said Franz dramatically, “a transference of the most fortuitous kind. That’s why I came down to meet you on a very busy day. I want you to come into my office and talk a long time before you see her. In fact, I sent her into Zurich to do errands.” His voice was tense with enthusiasm. “In fact, I sent her without a nurse, with a less stable patient. I’m intensely proud of this case, which I handled, with your accidental assistance.”

The car had followed the shore of the Zürichsee into a fertile region of pasture farms and low hills, steepled with châlets. The sun swam out into a blue sea of sky and suddenly it was a Swiss valley at its best—pleasant sounds and murmurs and a good fresh smell of health and cheer.

Professor Dohmler’s plant consisted of three old buildings and a pair of new ones, between a slight eminence and the shore of the lake. At its founding, ten years before, it had been the first modern clinic for mental illness; at a casual glance no layman would recognize it as a refuge for the broken, the incomplete, the menacing, of this world, though two buildings were surrounded with vine-softened walls of a deceptive height. Some men raked straw in the sunshine; here and there, as they rode into the grounds, the car passed the white flag of a nurse waving beside a patient on a path.

After conducting Dick to his office, Franz excused himself for half an hour. Left alone Dick wandered about the room and tried to reconstruct Franz from the litter of his desk, from his books and the books of and by his father and grandfather; from the Swiss piety of a huge claret-colored photo of the former on the wall. There was smoke in the room; pushing open a French window, Dick let in a cone of sunshine. Suddenly his thoughts swung to the patient, the girl.

He had received about fifty letters from her written over a period of eight months. The first one was apologetic, explaining that she had heard from America how girls wrote to soldiers whom they did not know. She had obtained the name and address from Doctor Gregory and she hoped he would not mind if she sometimes sent word to wish him well, etc., etc.

So far it was easy to recognize the tone—from Daddy-Long-Legs and Molly-Make-Believe, sprightly and sentimental epistolary collections enjoying a vogue in the States. But there the resemblance ended.

The letters were divided into two classes, of which the first class, up to about the time of the Armistice, was of marked pathological turn, and of which the second class, running from thence up to the present, was entirely normal, and displayed a richly maturing nature. For these latter letters Dick had come to wait eagerly in the last dull months at Bar-sur-Aube—yet even from the first letters he had pieced together more than Franz would have guessed of the story.

MON CAPITAINE:

I thought when I saw you in your uniform you were so handsome. Then I thought Je m’en fiche French too and German. You thought I was pretty too but I’ve had that before and a long time I’ve stood it. If you come here again with that attitude base and criminal and not even faintly what I had been taught to associate with the role of gentleman then heaven help you. However you seem quieter than the others, all soft like a big cat. I have only gotten to like boys who are rather sissies. Are you a sissy? There were some somewhere.

Excuse all this, it is the third letter I have written you and will send immediately or will never send. I’ve thought a lot about moonlight too, and there are many witnesses I could find if I could only be out of here.

They said you were a doctor, but so long as you are a cat it is different. My head aches so, so excuse this walking there like an ordinary with a white cat will explain, I think. I can speak three languages, four with English, and am sure I could be useful interpreting if you arrange such thing in France I’m sure I could control everything with the belts all bound around everybody like it was Wednesday. It is now Saturday and you are far away, perhaps killed.

Come back to me some day, for I will be here always on this green hill. Unless they will let me write my father, whom I loved dearly. Excuse this. I am not myself today. I will write when I feel better.

Cherio

NICOLE WARREN.

Excuse all this.

CAPTAIN DIVER:

I know introspection is not good for a highly nervous state like mine, but I would like you to know where I stand. Last year or whenever it was in Chicago when I got so I couldn’t speak to servants or walk in the street I kept waiting for some one to tell me. It was the duty of some one who understood. The blind must be led. Only no one would tell me everything—they would just tell me half and I was already too muddled to put two and two together. One man was nice—he was a French officer and he understood. He gave me a flower and said it was “plus petite et moins entendue.” We were friends. Then he took it away. I grew sicker and there was no one to explain to me. They had a song about Joan of Arc that they used to sing at me but that was just mean—it would just make me cry, for there was nothing the matter with my head then. They kept making reference to sports, too, but I didn’t care by that time. So there was that day I went walking on Michigan Boulevard on and on for miles and finally they followed me in an automobile, but I wouldn’t get in. Finally they pulled me in and there were nurses. After that time I began to realize it all, because I could feel what was happening in others. So you see how I stand. And what good can it be for me to stay here with the doctors harping constantly in the things I was here to get over. So today I have written my father to come and take me away. I am glad you are so interested in examining people and sending them back. It must be so much fun.

And again, from another letter:

You might pass up your next examination and write me a letter. They just sent me some phonograph records in case I should forget my lesson and I broke them all so the nurse won’t speak to me. They were in English, so that the nurses would not understand. One doctor in Chicago said I was bluffing, but what he really meant was that I was a twin six and he had never seen one before. But I was very busy being mad then, so I didn’t care what he said, when I am very busy being mad I don’t usually care what they say, not if I were a million girls.

You told me that night you’d teach me to play. Well, I think love is all there is or should be. Anyhow I am glad your interest in examinations keeps you busy.

Tout à vous,

NICOLE WARREN.

There were other letters among whose helpless cæsuras lurked darker rhythms.

DEAR CAPTAIN DIVER:

I write to you because there is no one else to whom I can turn and it seems to me if this farcicle situation is apparent to one as sick as me it should be apparent to you. The mental trouble is all over and besides that I am completely broken and humiliated, if that was what they wanted. My family have shamefully neglected me, there’s no use asking them for help or pity. I have had enough and it is simply ruining my health and wasting my time pretending that what is the matter with my head is curable.

Here I am in what appears to be a semi-insane-asylum, all because nobody saw fit to tell me the truth about anything. If I had only known what was going on like I know now I could have stood it I guess for I am pretty strong, but those who should have, did not see fit to enlighten me. And now, when I know and have paid such a price for knowing, they sit there with their dogs lives and say I should believe what I did believe. Especially one does but I know now.

I am lonesome all the time far away from friends and family across the Atlantic I roam all over the place in a half daze. If you could get me a position as interpreter (I know French and German like a native, fair Italian and a little Spanish) or in the Red Cross Ambulance or as a trained nurse, though I would have to train you would prove a great blessing.

And again:

Since you will not accept my explanation of what is the matter you could at least explain to me what you think, because you have a kind cat’s face, and not that funny look that seems to be so fashionable here. Dr. Gregory gave me a snapshot of you, not as handsome as you are in your uniform, but younger looking.

MON CAPITAINE:

It was fine to have your postcard. I am so glad you take such interest in disqualifying nurses—oh, I understood your note very well indeed. Only I thought from the moment I met you that you were different.

DEAR CAPITAINE:

I think one thing today and another tomorrow. That is really all that’s the matter with me, except a crazy defiance and a lack of proportion. I would gladly welcome any alienist you might suggest. Here they lie in their bath tubs and sing Play in Your Own Backyard as if I had my backyard to play in or any hope which I can find by looking either backward or forward. They tried it again in the candy store again and I almost hit the man with the weight, but they held me.

I am not going to write you any more. I am too unstable.

And then a month with no letters. And then suddenly the change.

—I am slowly coming back to life….

—Today the flowers and the clouds….

—The war is over and I scarcely knew there was a war….

—How kind you have been! You must be very wise behind your face like a white cat, except you don’t look like that in the picture Dr. Gregory gave me….

—Today I went to Zurich, how strange a feeling to see a city again.

—Today we went to Berne, it was so nice with the clocks.

—Today we climbed high enough to find asphodel and edelweiss….

After that the letters were fewer, but he answered them all. There was one:

I wish someone were in love with me like boys were ages ago before I was sick. I suppose it will be years, though, before I could think of anything like that.

But when Dick’s answer was delayed for any reason, there was a fluttering burst of worry—like a worry of a lover:“Perhaps I have bored you,” and:“Afraid I have presumed,” and “I keep thinking at night you have been sick.”

In actuality Dick was sick with the flu. When he recovered, all except the formal part of his correspondence was sacrificed to the consequent fatigue, and shortly afterward the memory of her became overlaid by the vivid presence of a Wisconsin telephone girl at headquarters in Bar-sur-Aube. She was red-lipped like a poster, and known obscenely in the messes as “The Switchboard.”

Franz came back into his office feeling self-important. Dick thought he would probably be a fine clinician, for the sonorous or staccato cadences by which he disciplined nurse or patient came not from his nervous system but from a tremendous and harmless vanity. His true emotions were more ordered and kept to himself.

“Now about the girl, Dick,” he said. “Of course, I want to find out about you and tell you about myself, but first about the girl, because I have been waiting to tell you about it so long.”

He searched for and found a sheaf of papers in a filing cabinet but after shuffling through them he found they were in his way and put them on his desk. Instead he told Dick the story.





3


About a year and a half before, Doctor Dohmler had some vague correspondence with an American gentleman living in Lausanne, a Mr. Devereux Warren, of the Warren family of Chicago. A meeting was arranged and one day Mr. Warren arrived at the clinic with his daughter Nicole, a girl of sixteen. She was obviously not well and the nurse who was with her took her to walk about the grounds while Mr. Warren had his consultation.

Warren was a strikingly handsome man looking less than forty.He was a fine American type in every way, tall, broad, well-made—“un homme très chic,” as Doctor Dohmler described him to Franz. His large gray eyes were sun-veined from rowing on Lake Geneva, and he had that special air about him of having known the best of this world. The conversation was in German, for it developed that he had been educated at Göttingen. He was nervous and obviously very moved by his errand.

“Doctor Dohmler, my daughter isn’t right in the head. I’ve had lots of specialists and nurses for her and she’s taken a couple of rest cures but the thing has grown too big for me and I’ve been strongly recommended to come to you.”

“Very well,” said Doctor Dohmler. “Suppose you start at the beginning and tell me everything.”

“There isn’t any beginning, at least there isn’t any insanity in the family that I know of, on either side. Nicole’s mother died when she was eleven and I’ve sort of been father and mother both to her, with the help of governesses—father and mother both to her.”

He was very moved as he said this. Doctor Dohmler saw that there were tears in the corners of his eyes and noticed for the first time that there was whiskey on his breath.

“As a child she was a darling thing—everybody was crazy about her, everybody that came in contact with her. She was smart as a whip and happy as the day is long. She liked to read or draw or dance or play the piano—anything. I used to hear my wife say she was the only one of our children who never cried at night. I’ve got an older girl, too, and there was a boy that died, but Nicole was—Nicole was—Nicole—”

He broke off and Doctor Dohmler helped him.

“She was a perfectly normal, bright, happy child.”

“Perfectly.”

Doctor Dohmler waited. Mr. Warren shook his head, blew a long sigh, glanced quickly at Doctor Dohmler and then at the floor again.

“About eight months ago, or maybe it was six months ago or maybe ten—I try to figure but I can’t remember exactly where we were when she began to do funny things—crazy things. Her sister was the first one to say anything to me about it—because Nicole was always the same to me,” he added rather hastily, as if some one had accused him of being to blame,“—the same loving little girl. The first thing was about a valet.”

“Oh, yes,” said Doctor Dohmler, nodding his venerable head, as if, like Sherlock Holmes, he had expected a valet and only a valet to be introduced at this point.

“I had a valet—been with me for years—Swiss, by the way.” He looked up for Doctor Dohmler’s patriotic approval. “And she got some crazy idea about him. She thought he was making up to her—of course, at the time I believed her and I let him go, but I know now it was all nonsense.”

“What did she claim he had done?”

“That was the first thing—the doctors couldn’t pin her down. She just looked at them as if they ought to know what he’d done. But she certainly meant he’d made some kind of indecent advances to her—she didn’t leave us in any doubt of that.”

“I see.”

“Of course, I’ve read about women getting lonesome and thinking there’s a man under the bed and all that, but why should Nicole get such an idea? She could have all the young men she wanted. We were in Lake Forest—that’s a summer place near Chicago where we have a place—and she was out all day playing golf or tennis with boys. And some of them pretty gone on her at that.”

All the time Warren was talking to the dried old package of Doctor Dohmler, one section of the latter’s mind kept thinking intermittently of Chicago. Once in his youth he could have gone to Chicago as fellow and docent at the university, and perhaps become rich there and owned his own clinic instead of being only a minor shareholder in a clinic. But when he had thought of what he considered his own thin knowledge spread over that whole area, over all those wheat fields, those endless prairies, he had decided against it. But he had read about Chicago in those days, about the great feudal families of Armour, Palmer, Field, Crane, Warren, Swift, and Mc Cormick and many others, and since that time not a few patients had come to him from that stratum of Chicago and New York.

“She got worse,” continued Warren. “She had a fit or something—the things she said got crazier and crazier. Her sister wrote some of them down—” He handed a much-folded piece of paper to the doctor. “Almost always about men going to attack her, men she knew or men on the street—anybody—”

He told of their alarm and distress, of the horrors families go through under such circumstances, of the ineffectual efforts they had made in America, finally of the faith in a change of scene that had made him run the submarine blockade and bring his daughter to Switzerland.

“—on a United States cruiser,” he specified with a touch of hauteur. “It was possible for me to arrange that, by a stroke of luck. And, may I add,” he smiled apologetically, “that as they say: money is no object.”

“Certainly not,” agreed Dohmler dryly.

He was wondering why and about what the man was lying to him. Or, if he was wrong about that, what was the falsity that pervaded the whole room, the handsome figure in tweeds sprawling in his chair with a sportsman’s ease? That was a tragedy out there, in the February day, the young bird with wings crushed somehow, and inside here it was all too thin, thin and wrong.

“I would like—to talk to her—a few minutes now,” said Doctor Dohmler, going into English as if it would bring him closer to Warren.

Afterward when Warren had left his daughter and returned to Lausanne, and several days had passed, the doctor and Franz entered upon Nicole’s card:

Diagnostic: Schizophrénie. Phase aiguë en décroissance. La peur des hommes est un symptôme de la maladie, et n’est point constitutionnelle…Le pronostic doit rester réservé.[1]

And then they waited with increasing interest as the days passed for Mr. Warren’s promised second visit.

It was slow in coming. After a fortnight Doctor Dohmler wrote. Confronted with further silence he committed what was for those days “une folie,” and telephoned to the Grand Hôtel at Vevey. He learned from Mr.Warren’s valet that he was at the moment packing to sail for America. But reminded that the forty francs Swiss for the call would show up on the clinic books, the blood of the Tuileries Guard rose to Doctor Dohmler’s aid and Mr. Warren was got to the phone.

“It is—absolutely necessary—that you come. Your daughter’s health—all depends. I can take no responsibility.”

“But look here, Doctor, that’s just what you’re for. I have a hurry call to go home!”

Doctor Dohmler had never yet spoken to any one so far away but he dispatched his ultimatum so firmly into the phone that the agonized American at the other end yielded. Half an hour after this second arrival on the Zürichsee, Warren had broken down, his fine shoulders shaking with awful sobs inside his easy-fitting coat, his eyes redder than the very sun on Lake Geneva, and they had the awful story.

“It just happened,” he said hoarsely. “I don’t know—I don’t know.”

“After her mother died when she was little she used to come into my bed every morning, sometimes she’d sleep in my bed. I was sorry for the little thing. Oh, after that, whenever we went places in an automobile or a train we used to hold hands. She used to sing to me. We used to say, ‘Now let’s not pay any attention to anybody else this afternoon—let’s just have each other—for this morning you’re mine.’ ” A broken sarcasm came into his voice. “People used to say what a wonderful father and daughter we were—they used to wipe their eyes. We were just like lovers—and then all at once we were lovers—and ten minutes after it happened I could have shot myself—except I guess I’m such a Goddamned degenerate I didn’t have the nerve to do it.”

“Then what?” said Doctor Dohmler, thinking again of Chicago and of a mild pale gentleman with a pince-nez who had looked him over in Zurich thirty years before. “Did this thing go on?”

“Oh, no! She almost—she seemed to freeze up right away. She’d just say, ‘Never mind, never mind, Daddy. It doesn’t matter. Never mind.’ ”

“There were no consequences?”

“No.” He gave one short convulsive sob and blew his nose several times. “Except now there’re plenty of consequences.”

As the story concluded Dohmler sat back in the focal armchair of the middle class and said to himself sharply, “Peasant!”—it was one of the few absolute worldly judgments that he had permitted himself for twenty years. Then he said:

“I would like for you to go to a hotel in Zurich and spend the night and come see me in the morning.”

“And then what?”

Doctor Dohmler spread his hands wide enough to carry a young pig.

“Chicago,” he suggested.

“Then we knew where we stood,” said Franz. “Dohmler told Warren we would take the case if he would agree to keep away from his daughter indefinitely, with an absolute minimum of five years. After Warren’s first collapse, he seemed chiefly concerned as to whether the story would ever leak back to America.”

“We mapped out a routine for her and waited. The prognosis was bad—as you know, the percentage of cures, even so-called social cures, is very low at that age.”

“Those first letters looked bad,” agreed Dick.

“Very bad—very typical. I hesitated about letting the first one get out of the clinic. Then I thought it will be good for Dick to know we’re carrying on here. It was generous of you to answer them.”

Dick sighed. “She was such a pretty thing—she enclosed a lot of snapshots of herself. And for a month there I didn’t have anything to do. All I said in my letters was ‘Be a good girl and mind the doctors.’ ”

“That was enough—it gave her somebody to think of outside. For a while she didn’t have anybody—only one sister that she doesn’t seem very close to. Besides, reading her letters helped us here—they were a measure of her condition.”

“I’m glad.”

“You see now what happened? She felt complicity—that’s neither here nor there, except as we want to revalue her ultimate stability and strength of character. First came this shock. Then she went off to a boarding-school and heard the girls talking—so from sheer self-protection she developed the idea that she had had no complicity—and from there it was easy to slide into a phantom world where all men, the more you liked them and trusted them, the more evil—”

“Did she ever go into the—horror directly?”

“No, and as a matter of fact when she began to seem normal, about October, we were in a predicament. If she had been thirty years old we would have let her make her own adjustment, but she was so young we were afraid she might harden with it all twisted inside her. So Doctor Dohmler said to her frankly, ‘Your duty now is to yourself. This doesn’t by any account mean the end of anything for you—your life is just at its beginning,’ and so forth and so forth. She really has an excellent mind, so he gave her a little Freud to read, not too much, and she was very interested. In fact, we’ve made rather a pet of her around here. But she is reticent,” he added; he hesitated:“We have wondered if in her recent letters to you which she mailed herself from Zurich, she has said anything that would be illuminating about her state of mind and her plans for the future.”

Dick considered.

“Yes and no—I’ll bring the letters out here if you want. She seems hopeful and normally hungry for life—even rather romantic. Sometimes she speaks of ‘the past’ as people speak who have been in prison. But you never know whether they refer to the crime or the imprisonment or the whole experience. After all I’m only a sort of stuffed figure in her life.”

“Of course, I understand your position exactly, and I express our gratitude once again. That was why I wanted to see you before you see her.”

Dick laughed.

“You think she’s going to make a flying leap at my person?”

“No, not that. But I want to ask you to go very gently. You are attractive to women, Dick.”

“Then God help me! Well, I’ll be gentle and repulsive—I’ll chew garlic whenever I’m going to see her and wear a stubble beard. I’ll drive her to cover.”

“Not garlic!” said Franz, taking him seriously. “You don’t want to compromise your career. But you’re partly joking.”

“—and I can limp a little. And there’s no real bathtub where I’m living, anyhow.”

“You’re entirely joking,” Franz relaxed—or rather assumed the posture of one relaxed. “Now tell me about yourself and your plans?”

“I’ve only got one, Franz, and that’s to be a good psychologist—maybe to be the greatest one that ever lived.”

Franz laughed pleasantly, but he saw that this time Dick wasn’t joking.

“That’s very good—and very American,” he said. “It’s more difficult for us.” He got up and went to the French window. “I stand here and I see Zurich—there is the steeple of the Gross-Münster. In its vault my grandfather is buried. Across the bridge from it lies my ancestor Lavater, who would not be buried in any church. Nearby is the statue of another ancestor, Heinrich Pestalozzi, and one of Doctor Alfred Escher. And over everything there is always Zwingli—I am continually confronted with a pantheon of heroes.”

“Yes, I see.” Dick got up. “I was only talking big. Everything’s just starting over. Most of the Americans in France are frantic to get home, but not me—I draw military pay all the rest of the year if I only attend lectures at the university. How’s that for a government on the grand scale that knows its future great men? Then I’m going home for a month and see my father. Then I’m coming back—I’ve been offered a job.”

“Where?”

“Your rivals—Gisler’s Clinic on Interlacken.”

“Don’t touch it,” Franz advised him. “They’ve had a dozen young men there in a year. Gisler’s a manic-depressive himself, his wife and her lover run the clinic—of course, you understand that’s confidential.”

“How about your old scheme for America?” asked Dick lightly.“We were going to New York and start an up-to-date establishment for billionaires.”

“That was students’ talk.”

Dick dined with Franz and his bride and a small dog with a smell of burning rubber, in their cottage on the edge of the grounds. He felt vaguely oppressed, not by the atmosphere of modest retrenchment, nor by Frau Gregorovious, who might have been prophesied, but by the sudden contracting of horizons to which Franz seemed so reconciled. For him the boundaries of asceticism were differently marked—he could see it as a means to an end, even as a carrying on with a glory it would itself supply, but it was hard to think of deliberately cutting life down to the scale of an inherited suit. The domestic gestures of Franz and his wife as they turned in a cramped space lacked grace and adventure. The post-war months in France, and the lavish liquidations taking place under the ægis of American splendor, had affected Dick’s outlook. Also, men and women had made much of him, and perhaps what had brought him back to the centre of the great Swiss watch, was an intuition that this was not too good for a serious man.

He made Kaethe Gregorovious feel charming, meanwhile becoming increasingly restless at the all-pervading cauliflower—simultaneously hating himself too for this incipience of he knew not what superficiality.

“God, am I like the rest after all?”—so he used to think starting awake at night—“Am I like the rest?”

This was poor material for a socialist but good material for those who do much of the world’s rarest work. The truth was that for some months he had been going through that partitioning of the things of youth wherein it is decided whether or not to die for what one no longer believes. In the dead white hours in Zurich staring into a stranger’s pantry across the upshine of a street-lamp, he used to think that he wanted to be good, he wanted to be kind, he wanted to be brave and wise, but it was all pretty difficult. He wanted to be loved, too, if he could fit it in.

The veranda of the central building was illuminated from open French windows, save where the black shadows of stripling walls and the fantastic shadows of iron chairs slithered down into a gladiola bed. From the figures that shuffled between the rooms Miss Warren emerged first in glimpses and then sharply when she saw him; as she crossed the threshold her face caught the room’s last light and brought it outside with her. She walked to a rhythm—all that week there had been singing in her ears, summer songs of ardent skies and wild shade, and with his arrival the singing had become so loud she could have joined in with it.

“How do you do, Captain,” she said, unfastening her eyes from his with difficulty, as though they had become entangled. “Shall we sit out here?” She stood still, her glance moving about for a moment. “It’s summer practically.”

A woman had followed her out, a dumpy woman in a shawl, and Nicole presented Dick:“Señora—”

Franz excused himself and Dick grouped three chairs together.

“The lovely night,” the Señora said.

“Muy bella,” agreed Nicole; then to Dick, “Are you here for a long time?”

“I’m in Zurich for a long time, if that’s what you mean.”

“This is really the first night of real spring,” the Señora suggested.

“To stay?”

“At least till July.”

“I’m leaving in June.”

“June is a lovely month here,” the Señora commented. “You should stay for June and then leave in July when it gets really too hot.”

“You’re going where?” Dick asked Nicole.

“Somewhere with my sister—somewhere exciting, I hope, because I’ve lost so much time. But perhaps they’ll think I ought to go to a quiet place at first—perhaps Como. Why don’t you come to Como?”

“Ah, Como—” began the Señora.

Within the building a trio broke into Suppé’s “Light Cavalry.” Nicole took advantage of this to stand up and the impression of her youth and beauty grew on Dick until it welled up inside him in a compact paroxysm of emotion. She smiled, a moving childish smile that was like all the lost youth in the world.

“The music’s too loud to talk against—suppose we walk around. Buenas noches, Señora.”

“G’t night—g’t night.”

They went down two steps to the path—where in a moment a shadow cut across it. She took his arm.

“I have some phonograph records my sister sent me from America,” she said. “Next time you come here I’ll play them for you—I know a place to put the phonograph where no one can hear.”

“That’ll be nice.”

“Do you know ‘Hindustan?’ ” she asked wistfully. “I’d never heard it before, but I like it. And I’ve got ‘Why Do They Call Them Babies?’ and ‘I’m Glad I Can Make You Cry.’ I suppose you’ve danced to all those tunes in Paris.”

“I haven’t been to Paris.”

Her cream-colored dress, alternately blue or gray as they walked, and her very blonde hair, dazzled Dick—whenever he turned toward her she was smiling a little, her face lighting up like an angel’s when they came into the range of a roadside arc. She thanked him for everything, rather as if he had taken her to some party, and as Dick became less and less certain of his relation to her, her confidence increased—there was that excitement about her that seemed to reflect all the excitement of the world.

“I’m not under any restraint at all,” she said. “I’ll play you two good tunes called ‘Wait Till the Cows Come Home’ and ‘Good-by, Alexander.’ ”

He was late the next time, a week later, and Nicole was waiting for him at a point in the path which he would pass walking from Franz’s house. Her hair drawn back of her ears brushed her shoulders in such a way that the face seemed to have just emerged from it, as if this were the exact moment when she was coming from a wood into clear moonlight. The unknown yielded her up; Dick wished she had no background, that she was just a girl lost with no address save the night from which she had come. They went to the cache where she had left the phonograph, turned a corner by the workshop, climbed a rock, and sat down behind a low wall, facing miles and miles of rolling night.

They were in America now, even Franz with his conception of Dick as an irresistible Lothario would never have guessed that they had gone so far away. They were so sorry, dear; they went down to meet each other in a taxi, honey; they had preferences in smiles and had met in Hindustan, and shortly afterward they must have quarrelled, for nobody knew and nobody seemed to care—yet finally one of them had gone and left the other crying, only to feel blue, to feel sad.

The thin tunes, holding lost times and future hopes in liaison, twisted upon the Swiss night. In the lulls of the phonograph a cricket held the scene together with a single note. By and by Nicole stopped playing the machine and sang to him.

Lay a silver dollar

On the ground

And watch it roll

Because it’s round—

On the pure parting of her lips no breath hovered. Dick stood up suddenly.

“What’s the matter, you don’t like it?”

“Of course I do.”

“Our cook at home taught it to me:

A woman never knows

What a good man she’s got

Till after she turns him down….

“You like it?”

She smiled at him, making sure that the smile gathered up everything inside her and directed it toward him, making him a profound promise of herself for so little, for the beat of a response, the assurance of a complimentary vibration in him. Minute by minute the sweetness drained down into her out of the willow trees, out of the dark world.

She stood up too, and stumbling over the phonograph, was momentarily against him, leaning into the hollow of his rounded shoulder.

“I’ve got one more record,” she said. “Have you heard ‘So Long, Letty’? I suppose you have.”

“Honestly, you don’t understand—I haven’t heard a thing.”

Nor known, nor smelt, nor tasted, he might have added; only hot-cheeked girls in hot secret rooms. The young maidens he had known at New Haven in 1914 kissed men, saying “There!” hands at the man’s chest to push him away. Now there was this scarcely saved waif of disaster bringing him the essence of a continent….

It was May when he next found her. The luncheon in Zurich was a council of caution; obviously the logic of his life tended away from the girl; yet when a stranger stared at her from a nearby table, eyes burning disturbingly like an uncharted light, he turned to the man with an urbane version of intimidation and broke the regard.

“He was just a peeper,” he explained cheerfully. “He was just looking at your clothes. Why do you have so many different clothes?”

“Sister says we’re very rich,” she offered humbly. “Since Grandmother is dead.”

“I forgive you.”

He was enough older than Nicole to take pleasure in her youthful vanities and delights, the way she paused fractionally in front of the hall mirror on leaving the restaurant, so that the incorruptible quicksilver could give her back to herself. He delighted in her stretching out her hands to new octaves now that she found herself beautiful and rich. He tried honestly to divorce her from any obsession that he had stitched her together—glad to see her build up happiness and confidence apart from him; the difficulty was that, eventually, Nicole brought everything to his feet, gifts of sacrificial ambrosia, of worshipping myrtle.

The first week of summer found Dick re-established in Zurich. He had arranged his pamphlets and what work he had done in the Service into a pattern from which he intended to make his revise of A Psychology for Psychiatrists. He thought he had a publisher; he had established contact with a poor student who would iron out his errors in German. Franz considered it a rash business, but Dick pointed out the disarming modesty of the theme.

“This is stuff I’ll never know so well again,” he insisted. “I have a hunch it’s a thing that only fails to be basic because it’s never had material recognition. The weakness of this profession is its attraction for the man a little crippled and broken. Within the walls of the profession he compensates by tending toward the clinical, the ‘practical’—he has won his battle without a struggle.

“On the contrary, you are a good man, Franz, because fate selected you for your profession before you were born. You better thank God you had no ‘bent’—I got to be a psychiatrist because there was a girl at St. Hilda’s in Oxford that went to the same lectures. Maybe I’m getting trite but I don’t want to let my current ideas slide away with a few dozen glasses of beer.”

“All right,” Franz answered. “You are an American. You can do this without professional harm. I do not like these generalities. Soon you will be writing little books called ‘Deep Thoughts for the Layman,’ so simplified that they are positively guaranteed not to cause thinking. If my father were alive he would look at you and grunt, Dick. He would take his napkin and fold it so, and hold his napkin ring, this very one”—he held it up, a boar’s head was carved in the brown wood—“and he would say, ‘Well my impression is—’ then he would look at you and think suddenly ‘What is the use?’ then he would stop and grunt again; then we would be at the end of dinner.”

“I am alone to-day,” said Dick testily. “But I may not be alone to-morrow. After that I’ll fold up my napkin like your father and grunt.”

Franz waited a moment.

“How about our patient?” he asked.

“I don’t know.”

“Well, you should know about her by now.”

“I like her. She’s attractive. What do you want me to do—take her up in the edelweiss?”

“No, I thought since you go in for scientific books you might have an idea.”

“—devote my life to her?”

Franz called his wife in the kitchen:“Du lieber Gott! Bitte, bringe Dick noch ein Glas Bier.”

“I don’t want any more if I’ve got to see Dohmler.”

“We think it’s best to have a program. Four weeks have passed away—apparently the girl is in love with you. That’s not our business if we were in the world, but here in the clinic we have a stake in the matter.”

“I’ll do whatever Doctor Dohmler says,” Dick agreed.

But he had little faith that Dohmler would throw much light on the matter; he himself was the incalculable element involved. By no conscious volition of his own, the thing had drifted into his hands. It reminded him of a scene in his childhood when everyone in the house was looking for the lost key to the silver closet, Dick knowing he had hid it under the handkerchiefs in his mother’s top drawer; at that time he had experienced a philosophical detachment, and this was repeated now when he and Franz went together to Professor Dohmler’s office.

The professor, his face beautiful under straight whiskers, like a vine-overgrown veranda of some fine old house, disarmed him. Dick knew some individuals with more talent, but no person of a class qualitatively superior to Dohmler.

—Six months later he thought the same way when he saw Dohmler dead, the light out on the veranda, the vines of his whiskers tickling his stiff white collar, the many battles that had swayed before the chink-like eyes stilled forever under the frail delicate lids—

“…Good morning, sir.” He stood formally, thrown back to the army.

Professor Dohmler interlaced his tranquil fingers. Franz spoke in terms half of liaison officer, half of secretary, till his senior cut through him in mid-sentence.

“We have gone a certain way,” he said mildly. “It’s you, Doctor Diver, who can best help us now.”

Routed out, Dick confessed:“I’m not so straight on it myself.”

“I have nothing to do with your personal reactions,” said Dohmler.“But I have much to do with the fact that this so-called ‘transference,’ ” he darted a short ironic look at Franz which the latter returned in kind, “must be terminated. Miss Nicole does well indeed, but she is in no condition to survive what she might interpret as a tragedy.”

Again Franz began to speak, but Doctor Dohmler motioned him silent.

“I realize that your position has been difficult.”

“Yes, it has.”

Now the professor sat back and laughed, saying on the last syllable of his laughter, with his sharp little gray eyes shining through:“Perhaps you have got sentimentally involved yourself.”

Aware that he was being drawn on, Dick, too, laughed.

“She’s a pretty girl—anybody responds to that to a certain extent. I have no intention—”

Again Franz tried to speak—again Dohmler stopped him with a question directed pointedly at Dick. “Have you thought of going away?”

“I can’t go away.”

Doctor Dohmler turned to Franz:“Then we can send Miss Warren away.”

“As you think best, Professor Dohmler,” Dick conceded. “It’s certainly a situation.”

Professor Dohmler raised himself like a legless man mounting a pair of crutches.

“But it is a professional situation,” he cried quietly.

He sighed himself back into his chair, waiting for the reverberating thunder to die out about the room. Dick saw that Dohmler had reached his climax, and he was not sure that he himself had survived it. When the thunder had diminished Franz managed to get his word in.

“Doctor Diver is a man of fine character,” he said. “I feel he only has to appreciate the situation in order to deal correctly with it. In my opinion Dick can co-operate right here, without any one going away.”

“How do you feel about that?” Professor Dohmler asked Dick.

Dick felt churlish in the face of the situation; at the same time he realized in the silence after Dohmler’s pronouncement that the state of inanimation could not be indefinitely prolonged; suddenly he spilled everything.

“I’m half in love with her—the question of marrying her has passed through my mind.”

“Tch! Tch!” uttered Franz.

“Wait.” Dohmler warned him. Franz refused to wait:“What! And devote half your life to being doctor and nurse and all—never! I know what these cases are. One time in twenty it’s finished in the first push—better never see her again!”

“What do you think?” Dohmler asked Dick.

“Of course Franz is right.”

It was late afternoon when they wound up the discussion as to what Dick should do, he must be most kind and yet eliminate himself. When the doctors stood up at last, Dick’s eyes fell outside the window to where a light rain was falling—Nicole was waiting, expectant, somewhere in that rain. When, presently, he went out buttoning his oil-skin at the throat, pulling down the brim of his hat, he came upon her immediately under the roof of the main entrance.

“I know a new place we can go,” she said. “When I was ill I didn’t mind sitting inside with the others in the evening—what they said seemed like everything else. Naturally now I see them as ill and it’s—it’s—”

“You’ll be leaving soon.”

“Oh, soon. My sister, Beth, but she’s always been called Baby, she’s coming in a few weeks to take me somewhere; after that I’ll be back here for a last month.”

“The older sister?”

“Oh, quite a bit older. She’s twenty-four—she’s very English. She lives in London with my father’s sister. She was engaged to an Englishman but he was killed—I never saw him.”

Her face, ivory gold against the blurred sunset that strove through the rain, had a promise Dick had never seen before: the high cheek-bones, the faintly wan quality, cool rather than feverish, was reminiscent of the frame of a promising colt—a creature whose life did not promise to be only a projection of youth upon a grayer screen, but instead, a true growing; the face would be handsome in middle life; it would be handsome in old age: the essential structure and the economy were there.

“What are you looking at?”

“I was just thinking that you’re going to be rather happy.”

Nicole was frightened:“Am I? All right—things couldn’t be worse than they have been.”

In the covered woodshed to which she had led him, she sat cross-legged upon her golf shoes, her burberry wound about her and her cheeks stung alive by the damp air. Gravely she returned his gaze, taking in his somewhat proud carriage that never quite yielded to the wooden post against which he leaned; she looked into his face that always tried to discipline itself into molds of attentive seriousness, after excursions into joys and mockeries of its own. That part of him which seemed to fit his reddish Irish coloring she knew least; she was afraid of it, yet more anxious to explore—this was his more masculine side: the other part, the trained part, the consideration in the polite eyes, she expropriated without question, as most women did.

“At least this institution has been good for languages,” said Nicole.“I’ve spoken French with two doctors, and German with the nurses, and Italian, or something like it, with a couple of scrub-women and one of the patients, and I’ve picked up a lot of Spanish from another.”

“That’s fine.”

He tried to arrange an attitude but no logic seemed forth-coming.

“—Music too. Hope you didn’t think I was only interested in ragtime. I practise every day—the last few months I’ve been taking a course in Zurich on the history of music. In fact it was all that kept me going at times—music and the drawing.” She leaned suddenly and twisted a loose strip from the sole of her shoe, and then looked up. “I’d like to draw you just the way you are now.”

It made him sad when she brought out her accomplishments for his approval.

“I envy you. At present I don’t seem to be interested in anything except my work.”

“Oh, I think that’s fine for a man,” she said quickly. “But for a girl I think she ought to have lots of minor accomplishments and pass them on to her children.”

“I suppose so,” said Dick with deliberated indifference.

Nicole sat quiet. Dick wished she would speak so that he could play the easy rôle of wet blanket, but now she sat quiet.

“You’re all well,” he said. “Try to forget the past; don’t overdo things for a year or so. Go back to America and be a débutante and fall in love—and be happy.”

“I couldn’t fall in love.” Her injured shoe scraped a cocoon of dust from the log on which she sat.

“Sure you can,” Dick insisted. “Not for a year maybe, but sooner or later.” Then he added brutally:“You can have a perfectly normal life with a houseful of beautiful descendants. The very fact that you could make a complete comeback at your age proves that the precipitating factors were pretty near everything. Young woman, you’ll be pulling your weight long after your friends are carried off screaming.”

—But there was a look of pain in her eyes as she took the rough dose, the harsh reminder.

“I know I wouldn’t be fit to marry any one for a long time,” she said humbly.

Dick was too upset to say any more. He looked out into the grain field trying to recover his hard brassy attitude.

“You’ll be all right—everybody here believes in you. Why, Doctor Gregory is so proud of you that he’ll probably—”

“I hate Doctor Gregory.”

“Well, you shouldn’t.”

Nicole’s world had fallen to pieces, but it was only a flimsy and scarcely created world; beneath it her emotions and instincts fought on. Was it an hour ago she had waited by the entrance, wearing her hope like a corsage at her belt?

…Dress stay crisp for him, button stay put, bloom narcissus—air stay still and sweet.

“It will be nice to have fun again,” she fumbled on. For a moment she entertained a desperate idea of telling him how rich she was, what big houses she lived in, that really she was a valuable property—for a moment she made herself into her grandfather, Sid Warren, the horse-trader. But she survived the temptation to confuse all values and shut these matters into their Victorian side-chambers—even though there was no home left to her, save emptiness and pain.

“I have to go back to the clinic. It’s not raining now.”

Dick walked beside her, feeling her unhappiness, and wanting to drink the rain that touched her cheek.

“I have some new records,” she said. “I can hardly wait to play them. Do you know—”

After supper that evening, Dick thought, he would finish the break; also he wanted to kick Franz’s bottom for having partially introduced him to such a sordid business. He waited in the hall. His eyes followed a beret, not wet with waiting like Nicole’s beret, but covering a skull recently operated on. Beneath it human eyes peered, found him and came over:

“Bonjour, Docteur.”

“Bonjour, Monsieur.”

“Il fait beau temps.”

“Oui, merveilleux.”

“Vous êtes ici maintenant?”

“Non, pour la journée seulement.”

“Ah, bon. Alors—au revoir, Monsieur.”

Glad at having survived another contact, the wretch in the beret moved away. Dick waited. Presently a nurse came downstairs and delivered him a message.

“Miss Warren asks to be excused, Doctor. She wants to lie down. She wants to have dinner upstairs to-night.”

The nurse hung on his response, half expecting him to imply that Miss Warren’s attitude was pathological.

“Oh, I see. Well—” He rearranged the flow of his own saliva, the pulse of his heart. “I hope she feels better. Thanks.”

He was puzzled and discontent. At any rate it freed him.

Leaving a note for Franz begging off from supper, he walked through the countryside to the tram station. As he reached the platform, with spring twilight gilding the rails and the glass in the slot machines, he began to feel that the station, the hospital, was hovering between being centripetal and centrifugal. He felt frightened. He was glad when the substantial cobble-stones of Zurich clicked once more under his shoes.

He expected to hear from Nicole next day but there was no word. Wondering if she was ill, he called the clinic and talked to Franz.

“She came downstairs to luncheon yesterday and to-day,” said Franz.“She seemed a little abstracted and in the clouds. How did it go off?”

Dick tried to plunge over the Alpine crevasse between the sexes.

“We didn’t get to it—at least I didn’t think we did. I tried to be distant, but I didn’t think enough happened to change her attitude if it ever went deep.”

Perhaps his vanity had been hurt that there was no coup de grâce to administer.

“From some things she said to her nurse I’m inclined to think she understood.”

“All right.”

“It was the best thing that could have happened. She doesn’t seem over-agitated—only a little in the clouds.”

“All right, then.”

“Dick, come soon and see me.”

During the next weeks Dick experienced a vast dissatisfaction. The pathological origin and mechanistic defeat of the affair left a flat and metallic taste. Nicole’s emotions had been used unfairly—what if they turned out to have been his own? Necessarily he must absent himself from felicity a while—in dreams he saw her walking on the clinic path swinging her wide straw hat….

One time he saw her in person; as he walked past the Palace Hotel, a magnificent Rolls curved into the half-moon entrance. Small within its gigantic proportions, and buoyed up by the power of a hundred superfluous horses, sat Nicole and a young woman whom he assumed was her sister. Nicole saw him and momentarily her lips parted in an expression of fright. Dick shifted his hat and passed, yet for a moment the air around him was loud with the circlings of all the goblins on the Gross-Münster. He tried to write the matter out of his mind in a memorandum that went into detail as to the solemn régime before her; the possibilities of another “push” of the malady under the stresses which the world would inevitably supply—in all a memorandum that would have been convincing to any one save to him who had written it.

The total value of this effort was to make him realize once more how far his emotions were involved; thenceforth he resolutely provided antidotes. One was the telephonegirl from Bar-sur-Aube, now touring Europe from Nice to Coblenz, in a desperate roundup of the men she had known in her never-to-be-equalled holiday; another was the making of arrangements to get home on a government transport in August; a third was a consequent intensification of work on his proofs for the book that this autumn was to be presented to the German-speaking world of psychiatry.

Dick had outgrown the book; he wanted now to do more spade work; if he got an exchange fellowship he could count on plenty of routine.

Meanwhile he had projected a new work: An Attempt at a Uniform and Pragmatic Classification of the Neuroses and Psychoses, Based on an Examination of Fifteen Hundred Pre-Kraepelin and Post-Kraepelin Cases as they would be Diagnosed in the Terminology of the Different Contemporary Schools—and another sonorous paragraph—Together with a Chronology of Such Subdivisions of Opinion as Have Arisen Independently.

This title would look monumental in German.[2]

Going into Montreux Dick pedalled slowly, gaping at the Jugenhorn whenever possible, and blinded by glimpses of the lake through the alleys of the shore hotels. He was conscious of the groups of English, emergent after four years and walking with detective-story suspicion in their eyes, as though they were about to be assaulted in this questionable country by German trained-bands. There were building and awakening everywhere on this mound of débris formed by a mountain torrent. At Berne and at Lausanne on the way south, Dick had been eagerly asked if there would be Americans this year. “By August, if not in June?”

He wore leather shorts, an army shirt, mountain shoes. In his knapsack were a cotton suit and a change of underwear. At the Glion funicular he checked his bicycle and took a small beer on the terrace of the station buffet, meanwhile watching the little bug crawl down the eighty-degree slope of the hill. His ear was full of dried blood from la Tour de Peilz, where he had sprinted under the impression that he was a spoiled athlete. He asked for alcohol and cleared up the exterior while the funicular slid down port. He saw his bicycle embarked, slung his knapsack into the lower compartment of the car, and followed it in.

Mountain-climbing cars are built on a slant similar to the angle of a hat-brim of a man who doesn’t want to be recognized. As water gushed from the chamber under the car, Dick was impressed with the ingenuity of the whole idea—a complimentary car was now taking on mountain water at the top and would pull the lightened car up by gravity, as soon as the brakes were released. It must have been a great inspiration. In the seat across, a couple of British were discussing the cable itself.

“The ones made in England always last five or six years. Two years ago the Germans underbid us, and how long do you think their cable lasted?”

“How long?”

“A year and ten months. Then the Swiss sold it to the Italians. They don’t have rigid inspections of cables.”

“I can see it would be a terrible thing for Switzerland if a cable broke.”

The conductor shut a door; he telephoned his confrère among the undulati, and with a jerk the car was pulled upward, heading for a pinpoint on an emerald hill above. After it cleared the low roofs, the skies of Vaud, Valais, Savoy, and Geneva spread around the passengers in cyclorama. On the centre of the lake, cooled by the piercing current of the Rhône, lay the true centre of the Western World. Upon it floated swans like boats and boats like swans, both lost in the nothingness of the heartless beauty. It was a bright day, with sun glittering on the grass beach below and the white courts of the Kursaal. The figures on the courts threw no shadows.

When Chillon and the island palace of Salagnon came into view Dick turned his eyes inward. The funicular was above the highest houses of the shore; on both sides a tangle of foliage and flowers culminated at intervals in masses of color. It was a rail-side garden, and in the car was a sign: Défense de cueillir les fleurs.

Though one must not pick flowers on the way up, the blossoms trailed in as they passed—Dorothy Perkins roses dragged patiently through each compartment slowly waggling with the motion of the funicular, letting go at the last to swing back to their rosy cluster. Again and again these branches went through the car.

In the compartment above and in front of Dick’s, a group of English were standing up and exclaiming upon the backdrop of sky, when suddenly there was a confusion among them—they parted to give passage to a couple of young people who made apologies and scrambled over into the rear compartment of the funicular—Dick’s compartment. The young man was a Latin with the eyes of a stuffed deer; the girl was Nicole.

The two climbers gasped momentarily from their efforts; as they settled into seats, laughing and crowding the English to the corners, Nicole said, “Hello.” She was lovely to look at; immediately Dick saw that something was different; in a second he realized it was her fine-spun hair, bobbed like Irene Castle’s and fluffed into curls. She wore a sweater of powder blue and a white tennis skirt—she was the first morning in May and every taint of the clinic was departed.

“Plunk!” she gasped. “Whoo-oo that guard. They’ll arrest us at the next stop. Doctor Diver, the Conte de Marmora.”

“Gee-imminy!” She felt her new hair, panting. “Sister bought first-class tickets—it’s a matter of principle with her.” She and Marmora exchanged glances and shouted:“Then we found that first-class is the hearse part behind the chauffeur—shut in with curtains for a rainy day, so you can’t see anything. But Sister’s very dignified—” Again Nicole and Marmora laughed with young intimacy.

“Where you bound?” asked Dick.

“Caux. You too?” Nicole looked at his costume. “That your bicycle they got up in front?”

“Yes. I’m going to coast down Monday.”

“With me on your handle-bars? I mean, really—will you? I can’t think of more fun.”

“But I will carry you down in my arms,” Marmora protested intensely. “I will roller-skate you—or I will throw you and you will fall slowly like a feather.”

The delight in Nicole’s face—to be a feather again instead of a plummet, to float and not to drag. She was a carnival to watch—at times primly coy, posing, grimacing and gesturing—sometimes the shadow fell and the dignity of old suffering flowed down into her finger tips. Dick wished himself away from her, fearing that he was a reminder of a world well left behind. He resolved to go to the other hotel.

When the funicular came to rest those new to it stirred in suspension between the blues of two heavens. It was merely for a mysterious exchange between the conductor of the car going up and the conductor of the car coming down. Then up and up over a forest path and a gorge—then again up a hill that became solid with narcissus, from passengers to sky. The people in Montreux playing tennis in the lakeside courts were pinpoints now. Something new was in the air; freshness—freshness embodying itself in music as the car slid into Glion and they heard the orchestra in the hotel garden.

When they changed to the mountain train the music was drowned by the rushing water released from the hydraulic chamber. Almost overhead was Caux, where the thousand windows of a hotel burned in the late sun.

But the approach was different—a leather-lunged engine pushed the passengers round and round in a corkscrew, mounting, rising; they chugged through low-level clouds and for a moment Dick lost Nicole’s face in the spray of the slanting donkey engine; they skirted a lost streak of wind with the hotel growing in size at each spiral, until with a vast surprise they were there, on top of the sunshine.

In the confusion of arrival, as Dick slung his knapsack and started forward on the platform to get his bicycle, Nicole was beside him.

“Aren’t you at our hotel?” she asked.

“I’m economizing.”

“Will you come down and have dinner?” Some confusion with baggage ensued. “This is my sister—Doctor Diver from Zurich.”

Dick bowed to a young woman of twenty-five, tall and confident. She was both formidable and vulnerable, he decided, remembering other women with flower-like mouths grooved for bits.

“I’ll drop in after dinner,” Dick promised. “First I must get acclimated.”

He wheeled off his bicycle, feeling Nicole’s eyes following him, feeling her helpless first love, feeling it twist around inside him. He went three hundred yards up the slope to the other hotel, he engaged a room and found himself washing without a memory of the intervening ten minutes, only a sort of drunken flush pierced with voices, unimportant voices that did not know how much he was loved.

They were waiting for him and incomplete without him. He was still the incalculable element; Miss Warren and the young Italian wore their anticipation as obviously as Nicole. The salon of the hotel, a room of fabled acoustics, was stripped for dancing but there was a small gallery of Englishwomen of a certain age, with neckbands, dyed hair and faces powdered pinkish gray; and of American women of a certain age, with snowy-white transformations, black dresses and lips of cherry red. Miss Warren and Marmora were at a corner table—Nicole was diagonally across from them forty yards away, and as Dick arrived he heard her voice:

“Can you hear me? I’m speaking naturally.”

“Perfectly,”

“Hello, Doctor Diver.”

“What’s this?”

“You realize the people in the centre of the floor can’t hear what I say, but you can?”

“A waiter told us about it,” said Miss Warren. “Corner to corner—it’s like wireless.”

It was exciting up on the mountain, like a ship at sea. Presently Marmora’s parents joined them. They treated the Warrens with respect—Dick gathered that their fortunes had something to do with a bank in Milan that had something to do with the Warren fortunes. But Baby Warren wanted to talk to Dick, wanted to talk to him with the impetus that sent her out vagrantly toward all new men, as though she were on an inelastic tether and considered that she might as well get to the end of it as soon as possible. She crossed and recrossed her knees frequently in the manner of tall restless virgins.

“—Nicole told me that you took part care of her, and had a lot to do with her getting well. What I can’t understand is what we’re supposed to do—they were so indefinite at the sanitarium; they only told me she ought to be natural and gay. I knew the Marmoras were up here so I asked Tino to meet us at the funicular. And you see what happens—the very first thing Nicole has him crawling over the sides of the car as if they were both insane—”

“That was absolutely normal,” Dick laughed. “I’d call it a good sign. They were showing off for each other.”

“But how can I tell? Before I knew it, almost in front of my eyes, she had her hair cut off, in Zurich, because of a picture in Vanity Fair.”

“That’s all right. She’s a schizoid—a permanent eccentric. You can’t change that.”

“What is it?”

“Just what I said—an eccentric.”

“Well, how can any one tell what’s eccentric and what’s crazy?”

“Nothing is going to be crazy—Nicole is all fresh and happy, you needn’t be afraid.”

Baby shifted her knees about—she was a compendium of all the discontented women who had loved Byron a hundred years before, yet, in spite of the tragic affair with the guards’ officer there was something wooden and onanistic about her.

“I don’t mind the responsibility,” she declared, “but I’m in the air. We’ve never had anything like this in the family before—we know Nicole had some shock and my opinion is it was about a boy, but we don’t really know. Father says he would have shot him if he could have found out.”

The orchestra was playing “Poor Butterfly;” young Marmora was dancing with his mother. It was a tune new enough to them all. Listening, and watching Nicole’s shoulders as she chattered to the elder Marmora, whose hair was dashed with white like a piano keyboard, Dick thought of the shoulders of a violin, and then he thought of the dishonor, the secret. Oh, butterfly—the moments pass into hours—

“Actually I have a plan,” Baby continued with apologetic hardness. “It may seem absolutely impractical to you but they say Nicole will need to be looked after for a few years. I don’t know whether you know Chicago or not—”

“I don’t.”

“Well, there’s a North Side and a South Side and they’re very much separated. The North Side is chic and all that, and we’ve always lived over there, at least for many years, but lots of old families, old Chicago families, if you know what I mean, still live on the South Side. The University is there. I mean it’s stuffy to some people, but anyhow it’s different from the North Side. I don’t know whether you understand.”

He nodded. With some concentration he had been able to follow her.

“Now of course we have lots of connections there—Father controls certain chairs and fellowships and so forth at the University, and I thought if we took Nicole home and threw her with that crowd—you see she’s quite musical and speaks all these languages—what could be better in her condition than if she fell in love with some good doctor—”

A burst of hilarity surged up in Dick, the Warrens were going to buy Nicole a doctor—You got a nice doctor you can let us use? There was no use worrying about Nicole when they were in the position of being able to buy her a nice young doctor, the paint scarcely dry on him.

“But how about the doctor?” he said automatically.

“There must be many who’d jump at the chance.”

The dancers were back, but Baby whispered quickly:

“This is the sort of thing I mean. Now where is Nicole—she’s gone off somewhere. Is she upstairs in her room? What am I supposed to do? I never know whether it’s something innocent or whether I ought to go find her.”

“Perhaps she just wants to be by herself—people living alone get used to loneliness.” Seeing that Miss Warren was not listening he stopped.“I’ll take a look around.”

For a moment all the outdoors shut in with mist was like spring with the curtains drawn. Life was gathered near the hotel. Dick passed some cellar windows where bus boys sat on bunks and played cards over a litre of Spanish wine. As he approached the promenade, the stars began to come through the white crests of the high Alps. On the horseshoe walk overlooking the lake Nicole was the figure motionless between two lamp stands, and he approached silently across the grass. She turned to him with an expression of:“Here you are,” and for a moment he was sorry he had come.

“Your sister wondered.”

“Oh!” She was accustomed to being watched. With an effort she explained herself:“Sometimes I get a little—it gets a little too much. I’ve lived so quietly. To-night that music was too much. It made me want to cry—”

“I understand.”

“This has been an awfully exciting day.”

“I know.”

“I don’t want to do anything anti-social—I’ve caused everybody enough trouble. But to-night I wanted to get away.”

It occurred to Dick suddenly, as it might occur to a dying man that he had forgotten to tell where his will was, that Nicole had been “re-educated” by Dohmler and the ghostly generations behind him; it occurred to him also that there would be so much she would have to be told. But having recorded this wisdom within himself, he yielded to the insistent face-value of the situation and said:

“You’re a nice person—just keep using your own judgment about yourself.”

“You like me?”

“Of course.”

“Would you—” They were strolling along toward the dim end of the horseshoe, two hundred yards ahead. “If I hadn’t been sick would you—I mean, would I have been the sort of girl you might have—oh, slush, you know what I mean.”

He was in for it now, possessed by a vast irrationality. She was so near that he felt his breathing change but again his training came to his aid in a boy’s laugh and a trite remark.

“You’re teasing yourself, my dear. Once I knew a man who fell in love with his nurse—” The anecdote rambled on, punctuated by their footsteps. Suddenly Nicole interrupted in succinct Chicagoese:“Bull!”

“That’s a very vulgar expression.”

“What about it?” she flared up. “You don’t think I’ve got any common sense—before I was sick I didn’t have any, but I have now. And if I don’t know you’re the most attractive man I ever met you must think I’m still crazy. It’s my hard luck, all right—but don’t pretend I don’t know—I know everything about you and me.”

Dick was at an additional disadvantage. He remembered the statement of the elder Miss Warren as to the young doctors that could be purchased in the intellectual stockyards of the South Side of Chicago, and he hardened for a moment. “You’re a fetching kid, but I couldn’t fall in love.”

“You won’t give me a chance.”

“What!”

The impertinence, the right to invade implied, astounded him. Short of anarchy he could not think of any chance that Nicole Warren deserved.

“Give me a chance now.”

The voice fell low, sank into her breast and stretched the tight bodice over her heart as she came up close. He felt the young lips, her body sighing in relief against the arm growing stronger to hold her. There were now no more plans than if Dick had arbitrarily made some indissoluble mixture, with atoms joined and inseparable; you could throw it all out but never again could they fit back into atomic scale. As he held her and tasted her, and as she curved in further and further toward him, with her own lips, new to herself, drowned and engulfed in love, yet solaced and triumphant, he was thankful to have an existence at all, if only as a reflection in her wet eyes.

“My God,” he gasped, “you’re fun to kiss.”

That was talk, but Nicole had a better hold on him now and she held it; she turned coquette and walked away, leaving him as suspended as in the funicular of the afternoon. She felt: There, that’ll show him, how conceited; how he could do with me; oh, wasn’t it wonderful! I’ve got him, he’s mine. Now in the sequence came flight, but it was all so sweet and new that she dawdled, wanting to draw all of it in.

She shivered suddenly. Two thousand feet below she saw the necklace and bracelet of lights that were Montreux and Vevey, beyond them a dim pendant of Lausanne. From down there somewhere ascended a faint sound of dance music. Nicole was up in her head now, cool as cool, trying to collate the sentimentalities of her childhood, as deliberate as a man getting drunk after battle. But she was still afraid of Dick, who stood near her, leaning, characteristically, against the iron fence that rimmed the horseshoe; and this prompted her to say:“I can remember how I stood waiting for you in the garden—holding all my self in my arms like a basket of flowers. It was that to me anyhow—I thought I was sweet—waiting to hand that basket to you.”

He breathed over her shoulder and turned her insistently about; she kissed him several times, her face getting big every time she came close, her hands holding him by the shoulders.

“It’s raining hard.”

Suddenly there was a booming from the wine slopes across the lake; cannons were shooting at hail-bearing clouds in order to break them. The lights of the promenade went off, went on again. Then the storm came swiftly, first falling from the heavens, then doubly falling in torrents from the mountains and washing loud down the roads and stone ditches; with it came a dark, frightening sky and savage filaments of lightning and world-splitting thunder, while ragged, destroying clouds fled along past the hotel. Mountains and lake disappeared—the hotel crouched amid tumult, chaos and darkness.

By this time Dick and Nicole had reached the vestibule, where Baby Warren and the three Marmoras were anxiously awaiting them. It was exciting coming out of the wet fog—with the doors banging, to stand and laugh and quiver with emotion, wind in their ears and rain on their clothes. Now in the ballroom the orchestra was playing a Strauss waltz, high and confusing.

…For Doctor Diver to marry a mental patient? How did it happen? Where did it begin?

“Won’t you come back after you’ve changed?” Baby Warren asked after a close scrutiny.

“I haven’t got any change, except some shorts.”

As he trudged up to his hotel in a borrowed raincoat he kept laughing derisively in his throat.

“Big chance—oh, yes. My God!—they decided to buy a doctor? Well, they better stick to whoever they’ve got in Chicago.” Revolted by his harshness he made amends to Nicole, remembering that nothing had ever felt so young as her lips, remembering rain like tears shed for him that lay upon her softly shining porcelain cheeks…. The silence of the storm ceasing woke him about three o’clock and he went to the window. Her beauty climbed the rolling slope, it came into the room, rustling ghost-like through the curtains….

…He climbed two thousand meters to Rochers de Naye the following morning, amused by the fact that his conductor of the day before was using his day off to climb also.

Then Dick descended all the way to Montreux for a swim, got back to his hotel in time for dinner. Two notes awaited him.

“I’m not ashamed about last night—it was the nicest thing that ever happened to me and even if I never saw you again, Mon Capitaine, I would be glad it happened.”

That was disarming enough—the heavy shade of Dohmler retreated as Dick opened the second envelope:

DEAR DOCTOR DIVER: I phoned but you were out. I wonder if I may ask you a great big favor. Unforeseen circumstances call me back to Paris, and I find I can make better time by way of Lausanne. Can you let Nicole ride as far as Zurich with you, since you are going back Monday? And drop her at the sanitarium? Is this too much to ask?

Sincerely,

BETH EVAN WARREN.

Dick was furious—Miss Warren had known he had a bicycle with him; yet she had so phrased her note that it was impossible to refuse. Throw us together! Sweet propinquity and the Warren money!

He was wrong; Baby Warren had no such intentions. She had looked Dick over with worldly eyes, she had measured him with the warped rule of an Anglophile and found him wanting—in spite of the fact that she found him toothsome. But for her he was too “intellectual” and she pigeonholed him with a shabby-snobby crowd she had once known in London—he put himself out too much to be really of the correct stuff. She could not see how he could be made into her idea of an aristocrat.

In addition to that he was stubborn—she had seen him leave her conversation and get down behind his eyes in that odd way that people did, half a dozen times. She had not liked Nicole’s free and easy manner as a child and now she was sensibly habituated to thinking of her as a “gone coon;” and anyhow Doctor Diver was not the sort of medical man she could envisage in the family.

She only wanted to use him innocently as a convenience.

But her request had the effect that Dick assumed she desired. A ride in a train can be a terrible, heavy-hearted or comic thing; it can be a trial flight; it can be a prefiguration of another journey just as a given day with a friend can be long, from the taste of hurry in the morning up to the realization of both being hungry and taking food together. Then comes the afternoon with the journey fading and dying, but quickening again at the end. Dick was sad to see Nicole’s meagre joy; yet it was a relief for her, going back to the only home she knew. They made no love that day, but when he left her outside the sad door on the Zürichsee and she turned and looked at him he knew her problem was one they had together for good now.

In Zurich in September Doctor Diver had tea with Baby Warren.

“I think it’s ill advised,” she said, “I’m not sure I truly understand your motives.”

“Don’t let’s be unpleasant.”

“After all I’m Nicole’s sister.”

“That doesn’t give you the right to be unpleasant.” It irritated Dick that he knew so much that he could not tell her. “Nicole’s rich, but that doesn’t make me an adventurer.”

“That’s just it,” complained Baby stubbornly. “Nicole’s rich.”

“Just how much money has she got?” he asked.

She started; and with a silent laugh he continued, “You see how silly this is? I’d rather talk to some man in your family—”

“Everything’s been left to me,” she persisted. “It isn’t we think you’re an adventurer. We don’t know who you are.”

“I’m a doctor of medicine,” he said. “My father is a clergyman, now retired. We lived in Buffalo and my past is open to investigation. I went to New Haven; afterward I was a Rhodes scholar. My great-grandfather was Governor of North Carolina and I’m a direct descendant of Mad Anthony Wayne.”

“Who was Mad Anthony Wayne?” Baby asked suspiciously.

“Mad Anthony Wayne?”

“I think there’s enough madness in this affair.”

He shook his head hopelessly, just as Nicole came out on the hotel terrace and looked around for them.

“He was too mad to leave as much money as Marshall Field,” he said.

“That’s all very well—”

Baby was right and she knew it. Face to face, her father would have it on almost any clergyman. They were an American ducal family without a title—the very name written in a hotel register, signed to an introduction, used in a difficult situation, caused a psychological metamorphosis in people, and in return this change had crystallized her own sense of position. She knew these facts from the English, who had known them for over two hundred years. But she did not know that twice Dick had come close to flinging the marriage in her face. All that saved it this time was Nicole finding their table and glowing away, white and fresh and new in the September afternoon.





How do you do, lawyer. We’re going to Como tomorrow for a week and then back to Zurich. That’s why I wanted you and sister to settle this, because it doesn’t matter to us how much I’m allowed. We’re going to live very quietly in Zurich for two years and Dick has enough to take care of us. No, Baby, I’m more practical than you think—It’s only for clothes and things I’ll need it…. Why, that’s more than—can the estate really afford to give me all that? I know I’ll never manage to spend it. Do you have that much? Why do you have more—is it because I’m supposed to be incompetent? All right, let my share pile up then…. No, Dick refuses to have anything whatever to do with it. I’ll have to feel bloated for us both…. Baby, you have no more idea of what Dick is like than, than—Now where do I sign? Oh, I’m sorry.

…Isn’t it funny and lonely being together, Dick. No place to go except close. Shall we just love and love? Ah, but I love the most, and I can tell when you’re away from me, even a little. I think it’s wonderful to be just like everybody else, to reach out and find you all warm beside me in the bed.

…If you will kindly call my husband at the hospital. Yes, the little book is selling everywhere—they want it published in six languages. I was to do the French translation but I’m tired these days—I’m afraid of falling, I’m so heavy and clumsy—like a broken roly-poly that can’t stand up straight. The cold stethoscope against my heart and my strongest feeling “Je m’en fiche de tout.”—Oh, that poor woman in the hospital with the blue baby, much better dead. Isn’t it fine there are three of us now?

…That seems unreasonable, Dick—we have every reason for taking the bigger apartment. Why should we penalize ourselves just because there’s more Warren money than Diver money. Oh, thank you, cameriere, but we’ve changed our minds. This English clergyman tells us that your wine here in Orvieto is excellent. It doesn’t travel? That must be why we have never heard of it, because we love wine.

The lakes are sunk in the brown clay and the slopes have all the creases of a belly. The photographer gave us the picture of me, my hair limp over the rail on the boat to Capri. “Good-by, Blue Grotte,” sang the boatman, “come again soo-oon.” And afterward tracing down the hot sinister shin of the Italian boot with the wind soughing around those eerie castles, the dead watching from up on those hills.

…This ship is nice, with our heels hitting the deck together. This is the blowy corner and each time we turn it I slant forward against the wind and pull my coat together without losing step with Dick. We are chanting nonsense:

Oh—oh—oh—oh

Other flamingoes than me,

Oh—oh—oh—oh

Other flamingoes than me—

Life is fun with Dick—the people in deck chairs look at us, and a woman is trying to hear what we are singing. Dick is tired of singing it, so go on alone, Dick. You will walk differently alone, dear, through a thicker atmosphere, forcing your way through the shadows of chairs, through the dripping smoke of the funnels. You will feel your own reflection sliding along the eyes of those who look at you. You are no longer insulated; but I suppose you must touch life in order to spring from it.

Sitting on the stanchion of this life-boat I look seaward and let my hair blow and shine. I am motionless against the sky and the boat is made to carry my form onward into the blue obscurity of the future, I am Pallas Athene carved reverently on the front of a galley. The waters are lapping in the public toilets and the agate green foliage of spray changes and complains about the stern.

…We travelled a lot that year—from Woolloomooloo Bay to Biskra. On the edge of the Sahara we ran into a plague of locusts and the chauffeur explained kindly that they were bumble-bees. The sky was low at night, full of the presence of a strange and watchful God. Oh, the poor little naked Ouled Naïl; the night was noisy with drums from Senegal and flutes and whining camels, and the natives pattering about in shoes made of old automobile tires.

But I was gone again by that time—trains and beaches they were all one. That was why he took me travelling but after my second child, my little girl, Topsy, was born everything got dark again.

…If I could get word to my husband who has seen fit to desert me here, to leave me in the hands of incompetents. You tell me my baby is black—that’s farcical, that’s very cheap. We went to Africa merely to see Timgad, since my principal interest in life is archeology. I am tired of knowing nothing and being reminded of it all the time.

…When I get well I want to be a fine person like you, Dick—I would study medicine except it’s too late. We must spend my money and have a house—I’m tired of apartments and waiting for you. You’re bored with Zurich and you can’t find time for writing here and you say that it’s a confession of weakness for a scientist not to write. And I’ll look over the whole field of knowledge and pick out something and really know about it, so I’ll have it to hang on to if I go to pieces again. You’ll help me, Dick, so I won’t feel so guilty. We’ll live near a warm beach where we can be brown and young together.

…This is going to be Dick’s work house. Oh, the idea came to us both at the same moment. We had passed Tarmes a dozen times and we rode up here and found the houses empty, except two stables. When we bought we acted through a Frenchman but the navy sent spies up here in no time when they found that Americans had bought part of a hill village. They looked for cannons all through the building material, and finally Baby had to twitch wires for us at the Affaires Étrangères in Paris.

No one comes to the Riviera in summer, so we expect to have a few guests and to work. There are some French people here—Mistinguett last week, surprised to find the hotel open, and Picasso and the man who wrote Pas sur la Bouche.

…Dick, why did you register Mr. and Mrs. Diver instead of Doctor and Mrs. Diver? I just wondered—it just floated through my mind—You’ve taught me that work is everything and I believe you. You used to say a man knows things and when he stops knowing things he’s like anybody else, and the thing is to get power before he stops knowing things. If you want to turn things topsy-turvy, all right, but must your Nicole follow you walking on her hands, darling?

…Tommy says I am silent. Since I was well the first time I talked a lot to Dick late at night, both of us sitting up in bed and lighting cigarettes, then diving down afterward out of the blue dawn and into the pillows, to keep the light from our eyes. Sometimes I sing, and play with the animals, and I have a few friends too—Mary, for instance. When Mary and I talk neither of us listens to the other. Talk is men. When I talk I say to myself that I am probably Dick. Already I have even been my son, remembering how wise and slow he is. Sometimes I am Doctor Dohmler and one time I may even be an aspect of you, Tommy Barban. Tommy is in love with me, I think, but gently, reassuringly. Enough, though, so that he and Dick have begun to disapprove of each other. All in all, everything has never gone better. I am among friends who like me. I am here on this tranquil beach with my husband and two children. Everything is all right—if I can finish translating this damn recipe for chicken à la Maryland into French. My toes feel warm in the sand.

“Yes, I’ll look. More new people—oh, that girl—yes. Who did you say she looked like…. No, I haven’t, we don’t get much chance to see the new American pictures over here. Rosemary who? Well, we’re getting very fashionable for July—seems very peculiar to me. Yes, she’s lovely, but there can be too many people.”





11


Doctor Richard Diver and Mrs. Elsie Speers sat in the Café des Alliés in August, under cool and dusty trees. The sparkle of the mica was dulled by the baked ground, and a few gusts of mistral from down the coast seeped through the Esterel and rocked the fishing boats in the harbor, pointing the masts here and there at a featureless sky.

“I had a letter this morning,” said Mrs. Speers. “What a terrible time you all must have had with those Negroes! But Rosemary said you were perfectly wonderful to her.”

“Rosemary ought to have a service stripe. It was pretty harrowing—the only person it didn’t disturb was Abe North—he flew off to Havre—he probably doesn’t know about it yet.”

“I’m sorry Mrs. Diver was upset,” she said carefully.

Rosemary had written:

“Nicole seemed Out of her Mind. I didn’t want to come South with them because I felt Dick had enough on his Hands.”

“She’s all right now.” He spoke almost impatiently. “So you’re leaving to-morrow. When will you sail?”

“Right away.”

“My God, it’s awful to have you go.”

“We’re glad we came here. We’ve had a good time, thanks to you. You’re the first man Rosemary ever cared for.”

Another gust of wind strained around the porphyry hills of la Napoule. There was a hint in the air that the earth was hurrying on toward other weather; the lush midsummer moment outside of time was already over.

“Rosemary’s had crushes but sooner or later she always turned the man over to me—” Mrs. Speers laughed, “—for dissection.”

“So I was spared.”

“There was nothing I could have done. She was in love with you before I ever saw you. I told her to go ahead.”

He saw that no provision had been made for him, or for Nicole, in Mrs. Speers’ plans—and he saw that her amorality sprang from the conditions of her own withdrawal. It was her right, the pension on which her own emotions had retired. Women are necessarily capable of almost anything in their struggle for survival and can scarcely be convicted of such man-made crimes as “cruelty.” So long as the shuffle of love and pain went on within proper walls Mrs. Speers could view it with as much detachment and humor as a eunuch. She had not even allowed for the possibility of Rosemary’s being damaged—or was she certain that she couldn’t be?

“If what you say is true I don’t think it did her any harm.” He was keeping up to the end the pretense that he could still think objectively about Rosemary. “She’s over it already. Still—so many of the important times in life begin by seeming incidental.”

“This wasn’t incidental,” Mrs. Speers insisted. “You were the first man—you’re an ideal to her. In every letter she says that.”

“She’s so polite.”

“You and Rosemary are the politest people I’ve ever known, but she means this.”

“My politeness is a trick of the heart.”

This was partly true. From his father Dick had learned the somewhat conscious good manners of the young Southerner coming north after the Civil War. Often he used them and just as often he despised them because they were not a protest against how unpleasant selfishness was but against how unpleasant it looked.

“I’m in love with Rosemary,” he told her suddenly. “It’s a kind of self-indulgence saying that to you.”

It seemed very strange and official to him, as if the very tables and chairs in the Café des Alliés would remember it forever. Already he felt her absence from these skies: on the beach he could only remember the sun-torn flesh of her shoulder; at Tarmes he crushed out her footprints as he crossed the garden; and now the orchestra launching into the “Nice Carnival Song,” an echo of last year’s vanished gaieties, started the little dance that went on all about her. In a hundred hours she had come to possess all the world’s dark magic; the blinding belladonna, the caffein converting physical into nervous energy, the mandragora that imposes harmony.

With an effort he once more accepted the fiction that he shared Mrs. Speers’ detachment.

“You and Rosemary aren’t really alike,” he said. “The wisdom she got from you is all molded up into her persona, into the mask she faces the world with. She doesn’t think; her real depths are Irish and romantic and illogical.”

Mrs. Speers knew too that Rosemary, for all her delicate surface, was a young mustang, perceptibly by Captain Doctor Hoyt, U.S.A. Cross-sectioned, Rosemary would have displayed an enormous heart, liver and soul, all crammed close together under the lovely shell.

Saying good-by, Dick was aware of Elsie Speers’ full charm, aware that she meant rather more to him than merely a last unwillingly relinquished fragment of Rosemary. He could possibly have made up Rosemary—he could never have made up her mother. If the cloak, spurs and brilliants in which Rosemary had walked off were things with which he had endowed her, it was nice in contrast to watch her mother’s grace knowing it was surely something he had not evoked. She had an air of seeming to wait, as if for a man to get through with something more important than herself, a battle or an operation, during which he must not be hurried or interfered with. When the man had finished she would be waiting, without fret or impatience, somewhere on a highstool, turning the pages of a newspaper.

“Good-by—and I want you both to remember always how fond of you Nicole and I have grown.”

Back at the Villa Diana, he went to his work-room, and opened the shutters, closed against the mid-day glare. On his two long tables, in ordered confusion, lay the materials of his book. Volume I, concerned with Classification, had achieved some success in a small subsidized edition. He was negotiating for its reissue. Volume II was to be a great amplification of his first little book, A Psychology for Psychiatrists. Like so many men he had found that he had only one or two ideas—that his little collection of pamphlets now in its fiftieth German edition contained the germ of all he would ever think or know.

But he was currently uneasy about the whole thing. He resented the wasted years at New Haven, but mostly he felt a discrepancy between the growing luxury in which the Divers lived, and the need for display which apparently went along with it. Remembering his Rumanian friend’s story, about the man who had worked for years on the brain of an armadillo, he suspected that patient Germans were sitting close to the libraries of Berlin and Vienna callously anticipating him. He had about decided to brief the work in its present condition and publish it in an undocumented volume of a hundred thousand words as an introduction to more scholarly volumes to follow.

He confirmed this decision walking around the rays of late afternoon in his work-room. With the new plan he could be through by spring. It seemed to him that when a man with his energy was pursued for a year by increasing doubts, it indicated some fault in the plan.

He laid the bars of gilded metal that he used as paperweights along the sheaves of notes. He swept up, for no servant was allowed in here, treated his washroom sketchily with Bon Ami, repaired a screen and sent off an order to a publishing house in Zurich. Then he drank an ounce of gin with twice as much water.

He saw Nicole in the garden. Presently he must encounter her and the prospect gave him a leaden feeling. Before her he must keep up a perfect front, now and to-morrow, next week and next year. All night in Paris he had held her in his arms while she slept light under the luminol; in the early morning he broke in upon her confusion before it could form,with words of tenderness and protection, and she slept again with his face against the warm scent of her hair. Before she woke he had arranged everything at the phone in the next room. Rosemary was to move to another hotel. She was to be “Daddy’s Girl” and even to give up saying good-by to them. The proprietor of the hotel, Mr. McBeth, was to be the three Chinese monkeys. Packing amid the piled boxes and tissue paper of many purchases, Dick and Nicole left for the Riviera at noon.

Then there was a reaction. As they settled down in the wagon-lit Dick saw that Nicole was waiting for it, and it came quickly and desperately, before the train was out of the ceinture—his only instinct was to step off while the train was still going slow, rush back and see where Rosemary was, what she was doing. He opened a book and bent his pince-nez upon it, aware that Nicole was watching him from her pillow across the compartment. Unable to read, he pretended to be tired and shut his eyes but she was still watching him, and though still she was half asleep from the hangover of the drug, she was relieved and almost happy that he was hers again.

It was worse with his eyes shut for it gave a rhythm of finding and losing, finding and losing; but so as not to appear restless he lay like that until noon. At luncheon things were better—it was always a fine meal; a thousand lunches in inns and restaurants, wagon-lits, buffets, and aeroplanes were a mighty collation to have taken together. The familiar hurry of the train waiters, the little bottles of wine and mineral water, the excellent food of the Paris-Lyons-Méditerranée gave them the illusion that everything was the same as before, but it was almost the first trip he had ever taken with Nicole that was a going away rather than a going toward. He drank a whole bottle of wine save for Nicole’s single glass; they talked about the house and the children. But once back in the compartment a silence fell over them like the silence in the restaurant across from the Luxembourg. Receding from a grief, it seems necessary to retrace the same steps that brought us there. An unfamiliar impatience settled on Dick; suddenly Nicole said:

“It seemed too bad to leave Rosemary like that—do you suppose she’ll be all right?”

“Of course. She could take care of herself anywhere—” Lest this belittle Nicole’s ability to do likewise, he added, “After all, she’s an actress, and even though her mother’s in the background she has to look out for herself.”

“She’s very attractive.”

“She’s an infant.”

“She’s attractive though.”

They talked aimlessly back and forth, each speaking for the other.

“She’s not as intelligent as I thought,” Dick offered.

“She’s quite smart.”

“Not very, though—there’s a persistent aroma of the nursery.”

“She’s very—very pretty,” Nicole said in a detached, emphatic way,“and I thought she was very good in the picture.”

“She was well directed. Thinking it over, it wasn’t very individual.”

“I thought it was. I can see how she’d be very attractive to men.”

His heart twisted. To what men? How many men?

—Do you mind if I pull down the curtain?

—Please do, it’s too light in here.

Where now? And with whom?

“In a few years she’ll look ten years older than you.”

“On the contrary. I sketched her one night on a theatre program, I think she’ll last.”

They were both restless in the night. In a day or two Dick would try to banish the ghost of Rosemary before it became walled up with them, but for the moment he had no force to do it. Sometimes it is harder to deprive oneself of a pain than of a pleasure and the memory so possessed him that for the moment there was nothing to do but to pretend. This was more difficult because he was currently annoyed with Nicole, who, after all these years, should recognize symptoms of strain in herself and guard against them. Twice within a fortnight she had broken up: there had been the night of the dinner at Tarmes when he had found her in her bedroom dissolved in crazy laughter telling Mrs. McKisco she could not go in the bathroom because the key was thrown down the well. Mrs. McKisco was astonished and resentful, baffled and yet in a way comprehending.Dick had not been particularly alarmed then, for afterward Nicole was repentant. She called at Gausse’s Hôtel but the McKiscos were gone.

The collapse in Paris was another matter, adding significance to the first one. It prophesied possibly a new cycle, a new pousse of the malady. Having gone through unprofessional agonies during her long relapse following Topsy’s birth, he had, perforce, hardened himself about her, making a cleavage between Nicole sick and Nicole well. This made it difficult now to distinguish between his self-protective professional detachment and some new coldness in his heart. As an indifference cherished, or left to atrophy, becomes an emptiness, to this extent he had learned to become empty of Nicole, serving her against his will with negations and emotional neglect. One writes of scars healed, a loose parallel to the pathology of the skin, but there is no such thing in the life of an individual. There are open wounds, shrunk sometimes to the size of a pin-prick but wounds still. The marks of suffering are more comparable to the loss of a finger, or of the sight of an eye. We may not miss them, either, for one minute in a year, but if we should there is nothing to be done about it.

He found Nicole in the garden with her arms folded high on her shoulders. She looked at him with straight gray eyes, with a child’s searching wonder.

“I went to Cannes,” he said. “I ran into Mrs. Speers. She’s leaving to-morrow. She wanted to come up and say good-by to you, but I slew the idea.”

“I’m sorry. I’d like to have seen her. I like her.”

“Who else do you think I saw—Bartholomew Tailor.”

“You didn’t.”

“I couldn’t have missed that face of his, the old experienced weasel. He was looking over the ground for Ciro’s menagerie—they’ll all be down next year. I suspected Mrs. Abrams was a sort of outpost.”

“And Baby was outraged the first summer we came here.”

“They don’t really give a damn where they are, so I don’t see why they don’t stay and freeze in Deauville.”

“Can’t we start rumors about cholera or something?”

“I told Bartholomew that some categories died off like flies here—I told him the life of a suck was as short as the life of a machine-gunner in the war.”

“You didn’t.”

“No, I didn’t,” he admitted. “He was very pleasant. It was a beautiful sight, he and I shaking hands there on the boulevard. The meeting of Sigmund Freud and Ward Mc Allister.”

Dick didn’t want to talk—he wanted to be alone so that his thoughts about work and the future would overpower his thoughts of love and to-day. Nicole knew about it but only darkly and tragically, hating him a little in an animal way, yet wanting to rub against his shoulder.

“The darling,” Dick said lightly.

He went into the house, forgetting something he wanted to do there, and then remembering it was the piano. He sat down whistling and played by ear:

Just picture you upon my knee

With tea for two and two for tea

And me for you and you for me—

Through the melody flowed a sudden realization that Nicole, hearing it, would guess quickly at a nostalgia for the past fortnight. He broke off with a casual chord and left the piano.

It was hard to know where to go. He glanced about the house that Nicole had made, that Nicole’s grandfather had paid for. He owned only his work house and the ground on which it stood. Out of three thousand a year and what dribbled in from his publications he paid for his clothes and personal expenses, for cellar charges, and for Lanier’s education, so far confined to a nurse’s wage. Never had a move been contemplated without Dick’s figuring his share. Living rather ascetically, travelling third-class when he was alone, with the cheapest wine, and good care of his clothes, and penalizing himself for any extravagances, he maintained a qualified financial independence. After a certain point, though, it was difficult—again and again it was necessary to decide together as to the uses to which Nicole’s money should be put. Naturally Nicole, wanting to own him, wanting him to stand still forever, encouraged any slackness on his part, and in multiplying ways he was constantly inundated by a trickling of goods and money. The inception of the idea of the cliff villa which they had elaborated as a fantasy one day was a typical example of the forces divorcing them from the first simple arrangements in Zurich.

“Wouldn’t it be fun if—” it had been; and then, “Won’t it be fun when—”

It was not so much fun. His work became confused with Nicole’s problems; in addition, her income had increased so fast of late that it seemed to belittle his work. Also, for the purpose of her cure, he had for many years pretended to a rigid domesticity from which he was drifting away, and this pretense became more arduous in this effortless immobility, in which he was inevitably subjected to microscopic examination. When Dick could no longer play what he wanted to play on the piano, it was an indication that life was being refined down to a point. He stayed in the big room a long time listening to the buzz of the electric clock, listening to time.

In November the waves grew black and dashed over the sea wall onto the shore road—such summer life as had survived disappeared and the beaches were melancholy and desolate under the mistral and rain. Gausse’s Hôtel was closed for repairs and enlargement and the scaffolding of the summer Casino at Juan-les-Pins grew larger and more formidable. Going into Cannes or Nice, Dick and Nicole met new people—members of orchestras, restaurateurs, horticultural enthusiasts, ship-builders—for Dick had bought an old dinghy—and members of the Syndicat d’Initiative. They knew their servants well and gave thought to the children’s education. In December, Nicole seemed well-knit again; when a month had passed without tension, without the tight mouth, the unmotivated smile, the unfathomable remark, they went to the Swiss Alps for the Christmas holidays.

With his cap, Dick slapped the snow from his dark blue ski-suit before going inside. The great hall, its floor pockmarked by two decades of hobnails, was cleared for the tea dance, and four-score young Americans, domiciled in schools near Gstaad, bounced about to the frolic of “Don’t Bring Lulu,” or exploded violently with the first percussions of the Charleston. It was a colony of the young, simple, and expensive—the Sturmtruppen of the rich were at St. Moritz. Baby Warren felt that she had made a gesture of renunciation in joining the Divers here.

Dick picked out the two sisters easily across the delicately haunted, soft-swaying room—they were poster-like, formidable in their snow costumes, Nicole’s of cerulean blue, Baby’s of brick red. The young Englishman was talking to them; but they were paying no attention, lulled to the staring point by the adolescent dance.

Nicole’s snow-warm face lighted up further as she saw Dick. “Where is he?”

“He missed the train—I’m meeting him later.” Dick sat down, swinging a heavy boot over his knee. “You two look very striking together. Every once in a while I forget we’re in the same party and get a big shock at seeing you.”

Baby was a tall, fine-looking woman, deeply engaged in being almost thirty. Symptomatically she had pulled two men with her from London, one scarcely down from Cambridge, one old and hard with Victorian lecheries. Baby had certain spinsters’ characteristics—she was alien from touch, she started if she was touched suddenly, and such lingering touches as kisses and embraces slipped directly through the flesh into the forefront of her consciousness. She made few gestures with her trunk, her body proper—instead, she stamped her foot and tossed her head in almost an old-fashioned way. She relished the foretaste of death, prefigured by the catastrophes of friends—persistently she clung to the idea of Nicole’s tragic destiny.

Baby’s younger Englishman had been chaperoning the women down appropriate inclines and harrowing them on the bob-run. Dick, having turned an ankle in a too ambitious telemark, loafed gratefully about the“nursery slope” with the children or drank kvass with a Russian doctor at the hotel.

“Please be happy, Dick,” Nicole urged him. “Why don’t you meet some of these ickle durls and dance with them in the afternoon?”

“What would I say to them?”

Her low almost harsh voice rose a few notes, simulating a plaintive coquetry:“Say:‘Ickle durl, oo is de pwettiest sing.’ What do you think you say?”

“I don’t like ickle durls. They smell of castile soap and peppermint. When I dance with them, I feel as if I’m pushing a baby carriage.”

It was a dangerous subject—he was careful, to the point of self-consciousness, to stare far over the heads of young maidens.

“There’s a lot of business,” said Baby. “First place, there’s news from home—the property we used to call the station property. The railroads only bought the centre of it at first. Now they’ve bought the rest, and it belonged to Mother. It’s a question of investing the money.”

Pretending to be repelled by this gross turn in the conversation, the Englishman made for a girl on the floor. Following him for an instant with the uncertain eyes of an American girl in the grip of a life-long Anglophilia, Baby continued defiantly:

“It’s a lot of money. It’s three hundred thousand apiece. I keep an eye on my own investments but Nicole doesn’t know anything about securities, and I don’t suppose you do either.”

“I’ve got to meet the train,” Dick said evasively.

Outside he inhaled damp snowflakes that he could no longer see against the darkening sky. Three children sledding past shouted a warning in some strange language; he heard them yell at the next bend and a little farther on he heard sleigh-bells coming up the hill in the dark. The holiday station glittered with expectancy, boys and girls waiting for new boys and girls, and by the time the train arrived, Dick had caught the rhythm, and pretended to Franz Gregorovious that he was clipping off a half-hour from an endless roll of pleasures. But Franz had some intensity of purpose at the moment that fought through any superimposition of mood on Dick’s part. “I may get up to Zurich for a day,” Dick had written, “or you can manage to come to Lausanne.” Franzhad managed to come all the way to Gstaad.

He was forty. Upon his healthy maturity reposed a set of pleasant official manners, but he was most at home in a somewhat stuffy safety from which he could despise the broken rich whom he re-educated. His scientific heredity might have bequeathed him a wider world but he seemed to have deliberately chosen the standpoint of an humbler class, a choice typified by his selection of a wife. At the hotel Baby Warren made a quick examination of him, and failing to find any of the hall-marks she respected, the subtler virtues or courtesies by which the privileged classes recognized one another, treated him thereafter with her second manner. Nicole was always a little afraid of him. Dick liked him, as he liked his friends, without reservations.

For the evening they were sliding down the hill into the village, on those little sleds which serve the same purpose as gondolas do in Venice. Their destination was a hotel with an old-fashioned Swiss tap-room, wooden and resounding, a room of clocks, kegs, steins, and antlers. Many parties at long tables blurred into one great party and ate fondue—a peculiarly indigestible form of Welsh rarebit, mitigated by hot spiced wine.

It was jolly in the big room; the younger Englishman remarked it and Dick conceded that there was no other word. With the pert heady wine he relaxed and pretended that the world was all put together again by the gray-haired men of the golden nineties who shouted old glees at the piano, by the young voices and the bright costumes toned into the room by the swirling smoke. For a moment he felt that they were in a ship with landfall just ahead; in the faces of all the girls was the same innocent expectation of the possibilities inherent in the situation and the night. He looked to see if that special girl was there and got an impression that she was at the table behind them—then he forgot her and invented a rigmarole and tried to make his party have a good time.

“I must talk to you,” said Franz in English. “I have only twenty-four hours to spend here.”

“I suspected you had something on your mind.”

“I have a plan that is—so marvellous.” His hand fell upon Dick’s knee. “I have a plan that will be the making of us two.”

“Well?”

“Dick—there is a clinic we could have together—the old clinic of Braun on the Zugersee. The plant is all modern except for a few points. He is sick—he wants to go up in Austria, to die probably. It is a chance that is just insuperable. You and me—what a pair! Now don’t say anything yet until I finish.”

From the yellow glint in Baby’s eyes, Dick saw she was listening.

“We must undertake it together. It would not bind you too tight—it would give you a base, a laboratory, a centre. You could stay in residence say no more than half the year, when the weather is fine. In winter you could go to France or America and write your texts fresh from clinical experience.” He lowered his voice. “And for the convalescence in your family, there are the atmosphere and regularity of the clinic at hand.” Dick’s expression did not encourage this note so Franz dropped it with the punctuation of his tongue leaving his lip quickly. “We could be partners. I the executive manager, you the theoretician, the brilliant consultant and all that. I know myself—I know I have no genius and you have. But, in my way, I am thought very capable; I am utterly competent at the most modern clinical methods. Sometimes for months I have served as the practical head of the old clinic. The professor says this plan is excellent, he advises me to go ahead. He says he is going to live forever, and work up to the last minute.”

Dick formed imaginary pictures of the prospect as a preliminary to any exercise of judgment.

“What’s the financial angle?” he asked.

Franz threw up his chin, his eyebrows, the transient wrinkles of his forehead, his hands, his elbows, his shoulders; he strained up the muscles of his legs, so that the cloth of his trousers bulged, pushed up his heart into his throat and his voice into the roof of his mouth.

“There we have it! Money!” he bewailed. “I have little money. The price in American money is two hundred thousand dollars. The innovation—ary—” he tasted the coinage doubtfully, “—steps, that you will agree are necessary, will cost twenty thousand dollars American. But the clinic is a gold mine—I tell you, I haven’t seen the books. For an investment of two hundred and twenty thousand dollars we have an assured income of—”

Baby’s curiosity was such that Dick brought her into the conversation.

“In your experience, Baby,” he demanded, “have you found that when a European wants to see an American very pressingly it is invariably something concerned with money?”

“What is it?” she said innocently.

“This young Privatdocent thinks that he and I ought to launch into big business and try to attract nervous breakdowns from America.”

Worried, Franz stared at Baby as Dick continued:

“But who are we, Franz? You bear a big name and I’ve written two textbooks. Is that enough to attract anybody? And I haven’t got that much money—I haven’t got a tenth of it.” Franz smiled cynically. “Honestly I haven’t. Nicole and Baby are rich as Croesus but I haven’t managed to get my hands on any of it yet.”

They were all listening now—Dick wondered if the girl at the table behind was listening too. The idea attracted him. He decided to let Baby speak for him, as one often lets women raise their voices over issues that are not in their hands. Baby became suddenly her grandfather, cool and experimental.

“I think it’s a suggestion you ought to consider, Dick. I don’t know what Doctor Gregory was saying—but it seems to me—”

Behind him the girl had leaned forward into a smoke ring and was picking up something from the floor. Nicole’s face, fitted into his own across the table—her beauty, tentatively nesting and posing, flowed into his love, ever braced to protect it.

“Consider it, Dick,” Franz urged excitedly. “When one writes on psychiatry, one should have actual clinical contacts. Jung writes, Bleuler writes, Freud writes, Forel writes, Adler writes—also they are in constant contact with mental disorder.”

“Dick has me,” laughed Nicole. “I should think that’d be enough mental disorder for one man.”

“That’s different,” said Franz cautiously.

Baby was thinking that if Nicole lived beside a clinic she would always feel quite safe about her.

“We must think it over carefully,” she said.

Though amused at her insolence, Dick did not encourage it.

“The decision concerns me, Baby,” he said gently. “It’s nice of you to want to buy me a clinic.”

Realizing she had meddled, Baby withdrew hurriedly:

“Of course, it’s entirely your affair.”

“A thing as important as this will take weeks to decide. I wonder how I like the picture of Nicole and me anchored to Zurich—” He turned to Franz, anticipating:“—I know. Zurich has a gashouse and running water and electric light—I lived there three years.”

“I will leave you to think it over,” said Franz. “I am confident—”

One hundred pair of five-pound boots had begun to clump toward the door, and they joined the press. Outside in the crisp moonlight, Dick saw the girl tying her sled to one of the sleighs ahead. They piled into their own sleigh and at the crisp-cracking whips the horses strained, breasting the dark air. Past them figures ran and scrambled, the younger ones shoving each other from sleds and runners, landing in the soft snow, then panting after the horses to drop exhausted on a sled or wail that they were abandoned. On either side the fields were beneficently tranquil; the space through which the cavalcade moved was high and limitless. In the country there was less noise as though they were all listening atavistically for wolves in the wide snow.

In Saanen, they poured into the municipal dance, crowded with cow herders, hotel servants, shop-keepers, ski teachers, guides, tourists, peasants. To come into the warm enclosed place after the pantheistic animal feeling without, was to reassume some absurd and impressive knightly name, as thunderous as spurred boots in war, as football cleats on the cement of a locker-room floor. There was conventional yodelling, and the familiar rhythm of it separated Dick from what he had first found romantic in the scene. At first he thought it was because he had hounded the girl out of his consciousness; then it came to him under the form of what Baby had said:“We must think it over carefully—” and the unsaid lines back of that:“We own you, and you’ll admit it sooner or later. It is absurd to keep up the pretense of independence.”

It had been years since Dick had bottled up malice against a creature—since freshman year at New Haven when he had come upon a popular essay about “mental hygiene.” Now he lost his temper at Baby and simultaneously tried to coop it up within him, resenting her cold rich insolence. It would be hundreds of years before any emergent Amazons would ever grasp the fact that a man is vulnerable only in his pride, but delicate as Humpty Dumpty once that is meddled with—though some of them paid the fact a cautious lip-service. Doctor Diver’s profession of sorting the broken shells of another sort of egg had given him a dread of breakage. But:

“There’s too much good manners,” he said on the way back to Gstaad in the smooth sleigh.

“Well, I think that’s nice,” said Baby.

“No, it isn’t,” he insisted to the anonymous bundle of fur. “Good manners are an admission that everybody is so tender that they have to be handled with gloves. Now, human respect—you don’t call a man a coward or a liar lightly, but if you spend your life sparing people’s feelings and feeding their vanity, you get so you can’t distinguish what should be respected in them.”

“I think Americans take their manners rather seriously,” said the elder Englishman.

“I guess so,” said Dick. “My father had the kind of manners he inherited from the days when you shot first and apologized afterward. Men armed—why, you Europeans haven’t carried arms in civil life since the beginning of the eighteenth century—”

“Not actually, perhaps—”

“Not actually. Not really.”

“Dick, you’ve always had such beautiful manners,” said Baby conciliatingly.

The women were regarding him across the zoo of robes with some alarm. The younger Englishman did not understand—he was one of the kind who were always jumping around cornices and balconies, as if they thought they were in the rigging of a ship—and filled the ride to the hotel with a preposterous story about a boxing match with his best friend in which they loved and bruised each other for an hour, always with great reserve. Dick became facetious.

“So every time he hit you you considered him an even better friend?”

“I respected him more.”

“It’s the premise I don’t understand. You and your best friend scrap about a trivial matter—”

“If you don’t understand, I can’t explain it to you,” said the young Englishman coldly.

—This is what I’ll get if I begin saying what I think, Dick said to himself.

He was ashamed at baiting the man, realizing that the absurdity of the story rested in the immaturity of the attitude combined with the sophisticated method of its narration.

The carnival spirit was strong and they went with the crowd into the grill, where a Tunisian barman manipulated the illumination in a counterpoint, whose other melody was the moon off the ice rink staring in the big windows. In that light, Dick found the girl devitalized, and uninteresting—he turned from her to enjoy the darkness, the cigarette points going green and silver when the lights shone red, the band of white that fell across the dancers as the door to the bar was opened and closed.

“Now tell me, Franz,” he demanded, “do you think after sitting up all night drinking beer, you can go back and convince your patients that you have any character? Don’t you think they’ll see you’re a gastropath?”

“I’m going to bed,” Nicole announced. Dick accompanied her to the door of the elevator.

“I’d come with you but I must show Franz that I’m not intended for a clinician.”

Nicole walked into the elevator.

“Baby has lots of common sense,” she said meditatively.

“Baby is one of—”

The door slashed shut—facing a mechanical hum, Dick finished the sentence in his mind, “—Baby is a trivial, selfish woman.”

But two days later, sleighing to the station with Franz, Dick admitted that he thought favorably upon the matter.

“We’re beginning to turn in a circle,” he admitted. “Living on this scale, there’s an unavoidable series of strains, and Nicole doesn’t survive them. The pastoral quality down on the summer Riviera is all changing anyhow—next year they’ll have a Season.”

They passed the crisp green rinks where Wiener waltzes blared and the colors of many mountain schools flashed against the pale-blue skies.

“—I hope we’ll be able to do it, Franz. There’s nobody I’d rather try it with than you—”

Good-by, Gstaad! Good-by, fresh faces, cold sweet flowers, flakes in the darkness. Good-by, Gstaad, good-by!





14


Dick awoke at five after a long dream of war, walked to the window and stared out it at the Zugersee. His dream had begun in sombre majesty; navy blue uniforms crossed a dark plaza behind bands playing the second movement of Prokofieff’s “Love of Three Oranges.” Presently there were fire engines, symbols of disaster, and a ghastly uprising of the mutilated in a dressing station. He turned on his bed-lamp light and made a thorough note of it ending with the half-ironic phrase:“Non-combatant’s shell-shock.”

As he sat on the side of his bed, he felt the room, the house and the night as empty. In the next room Nicole muttered something desolate and he felt sorry for whatever loneliness she was feeling in her sleep. For him time stood still and then every few years accelerated in a rush, like the quick re-wind of a film, but for Nicole the years slipped away by clock and calendar and birthday, with the added poignance of her perishable beauty.

Even this past year and a half on the Zugersee seemed wasted time for her, the seasons marked only by the workmen on the road turning pink in May, brown in July, black in September, white again in Spring. She had come out of her first illness alive with new hopes, expecting so much, yet deprived of any subsistence except Dick, bringing up children she could only pretend gently to love, guided orphans. The people she liked, rebels mostly, disturbed her and were bad for her—she sought in them the vitality that had made them independent or creative or rugged, sought in vain—for their secrets were buried deep in childhood struggles they had forgotten. They were more interested in Nicole’s exterior harmony and charm, the other face of her illness. She led a lonely life owning Dick who did not want to be owned.

Many times he had tried unsuccessfully to let go his hold on her. They had many fine times together, fine talks between the loves of the white nights, but always when he turned away from her into himself he left her holding Nothing in her hands and staring at it, calling it many names, but knowing it was only the hope that he would come back soon.

He scrunched his pillow hard, lay down, and put the back of his neck against it as a Japanese does to slow the circulation, and slept again for a time. Later, while he shaved, Nicole awoke and marched around, giving abrupt, succinct orders to children and servants. Lanier came in to watch his father shave—living beside a psychiatric clinic he had developed an extraordinary confidence in and admiration for his father, together with an exaggerated indifference toward most other adults; the patients appeared to him either in their odd aspects, or else as devitalized, over-correct creatures without personality. He was a handsome, promising boy and Dick devoted much time to him, in the relationship of a sympathetic but exacting officer and respectful enlisted man.

“Why,” Lanier asked, “do you always leave a little lather on the top of your hair when you shave?”

Cautiously Dick parted soapy lips:“I have never been able to find out. I’ve often wondered. I think it’s because I get the first finger soapy when I make the line of my side-burn, but how it gets up on top of my head I don’t know.”

“I’m going to watch it all to-morrow.”

“That’s your only question before breakfast.”

“I don’t really call it a question.”

“That’s one on you.”

Half an hour later Dick started up to the administration building. He was thirty-eight—still declining a beard he yet had a more medical aura about him than he had worn upon the Riviera. For eighteen months now he had lived at the clinic—certainly one of the best-appointed in Europe. Like Dohmler’s it was of the modern type—no longer a single dark and sinister building but a small, scattered, yet deceitfully integrated village—Dick and Nicole had added much in the domain of taste, so that the plant was a thing of beauty, visited by every psychologist passing through Zurich. With the addition of a caddy house it might very well have been a country club. The Eglantine and the Beeches, houses for those sunk into eternal darkness, were screened by little copses from the main building, camouflaged strong-points. Behind was a large truck farm, worked partly by the patients. The workshops for ergo-therapy were three, placed under a single roof, and there Doctor Diver began his morning’s inspection. The carpentry shop, full of sunlight, exuded the sweetness of sawdust, of a lost age of wood; always half a dozen men were there, hammering, planing, buzzing—silent men, who lifted solemn eyes from their work as he passed through. Himself a good carpenter, he discussed with them the efficiency of some tools for a moment in a quiet, personal, interested voice. Adjoining was the book-bindery, adapted to the most mobile of patients who were not always, however, those who had the greatest chance for recovery. The last chamber was devoted to beadwork, weaving and work in brass. The faces of the patients here wore the expression of one who had just sighed profoundly, dismissing something insoluble—but their sighs only marked the beginning of another ceaseless round of ratiocination, not in a line as with normal people but in the same circle. Round, round, and round. Around forever. But the bright colors of the stuffs they worked with gave strangers a momentary illusion that all was well, as in a kindergarten. These patients brightened as Doctor Diver came in. Most of them liked him better than they liked Doctor Gregorovious. Those who had once lived in the great world invariably liked him better. There were a few who thought he neglected them, or that he was not simple, or that he posed. Their responses were not dissimilar to those that Dick evoked in non-professional life, but here they were warped and distorted.

One Englishwoman spoke to him always about a subject which she considered her own.

“Have we got music to-night?”

“I don’t know,” he answered. “I haven’t seen Doctor Lladislau. How did you enjoy the music that Mrs. Sachs and Mr. Longstreet gave us last night?”

“It was so-so.”

“I thought it was fine—especially the Chopin.”

“I thought it was so-so.”

“When are you going to play for us yourself?”

She shrugged her shoulders, as pleased at this question as she had been for several years.

“Some time. But I only play so-so.”

They knew that she did not play at all—she had had two sisters who were brilliant musicians, but she had never been able to learn the notes when they had been young together.

From the workshop Dick went to visit the Eglantine and the Beeches. Exteriorly these houses were as cheerful as the others; Nicole had designed the decoration and the furniture on a necessary base of concealed grills and bars and immovable furniture. She had worked with so much imagination—the inventive quality, which she lacked, being supplied by the problem itself—that no uninstructed visitor would have dreamed that the light, graceful filagree work at a window was a strong, unyielding end of a tether, that the pieces reflecting modern tubular tendencies were stancher than the massive creations of the Edwardians—even the flowers lay in iron fingers and every casual ornament and fixture was as necessary as a girder in a skyscraper. Her tireless eyes had made each room yield up its greatest usefulness. Complimented, she referred to herself brusquely as a master plumber.

For those whose compasses were not depolarized there seemed many odd things in these houses. Doctor Diver was often amused in the Eglantine, the men’s building—here there was a strange little exhibitionist who thought that if he could walk unclothed and unmolested from the Étoile to the Place de la Concorde he would solve many things—and, perhaps, Dick thought, he was quite right.

His most interesting case was in the main building. The patient was a woman of thirty who had been in the clinic six months; she was an American painter who had lived long in Paris. They had no very satisfactory history of her. A cousin had happened upon her all mad and gone and after an unsatisfactory interlude at one of the whoopee cures that fringed the city, dedicated largely to tourist victims of drug and drink, he had managed to get her to Switzerland. On her admittance she had been exceptionally pretty—now she was a living agonizing sore. All blood tests had failed to give a positive reaction and the trouble was unsatisfactorily catalogued as nervous eczema. For two months she had lain under it, as imprisoned as in the Iron Maiden. She was coherent, even brilliant, within the limits of her special hallucinations.

She was particularly his patient. During spells of overexcitement he was the only doctor who could “do anything with her.” Several weeks ago, on one of many nights that she had passed in sleepless torture, Franz had succeeded in hypnotizing her into a few hours of needed rest, but he had never again succeeded. Hypnosis was a tool that Dick had distrusted and seldom used, for he knew that he could not always summon up the mood in himself—he had once tried it on Nicole and she had scornfully laughed at him.

The woman in room twenty could not see him when he came in—the area about her eyes was too tightly swollen. She spoke in a strong, rich, deep, thrilling voice.

“How long will this last? Is it going to be forever?”

“It’s not going to be very long now. Doctor Lladislau tells me there are whole areas cleared up.”

“If I knew what I had done to deserve this I could accept it with equanimity.”

“It isn’t wise to be mystical about it—we recognize it as a nervous phenomenon. It’s related to the blush—when you were a girl, did you blush easily?”

She lay with her face turned to the ceiling.

“I have found nothing to blush for since I cut my wisdom teeth.”

“Haven’t you committed your share of petty sins and mistakes?”

“I have nothing to reproach myself with.”

“You’re very fortunate.”

The woman thought a moment; her voice came up through her bandaged face afflicted with subterranean melodies:

“I’m sharing the fate of the women of my time who challenged men to battle.”

“To your vast surprise it was just like all battles,” he answered, adopting her formal diction.

“Just like all battles.” She thought this over. “You pick a set-up, or else win a Pyrrhic victory, or you’re wrecked and ruined—you’re a ghostly echo from a broken wall.”

“You are neither wrecked nor ruined,” he told her. “Are you quite sure you’ve been in a real battle?”

“Look at me!” she cried furiously.

“You’ve suffered, but many women suffered before they mistook themselves for men.” It was becoming an argument and he retreated. “In any case you mustn’t confuse a single failure with a final defeat.”

She sneered. “Beautiful words,” and the phrase transpiring up through the crust of pain humbled him.

“We would like to go into the true reasons that brought you here—” he began but she interrupted.

“I am here as a symbol of something. I thought perhaps you would know what it was.”

“You are sick,” he said mechanically.

“Then what was it I had almost found?”

“A greater sickness.”

“That’s all?”

“That’s all.” With disgust he heard himself lying, but here and now the vastness of the subject could only be compressed into a lie. “Outside of that there’s only confusion and chaos. I won’t lecture to you—we have too acute a realization of your physical suffering. But it’s only by meeting the problems of every day, no matter how trifling and boring they seem, that you can make things drop back into place again. After that—perhaps you’ll be able again to examine—”

He had slowed up to avoid the inevitable end of his thought:“—the frontiers of consciousness.” The frontiers that artists must explore were not for her, ever. She was fine-spun, inbred—eventually she might find rest in some quiet mysticism. Exploration was for those with a measure of peasant blood, those with big thighs and thick ankles who could take punishment as they took bread and salt, on every inch of flesh and spirit.

—Not for you, he almost said. It’s too tough a game for you.

Yet in the awful majesty of her pain he went out to her unreservedly, almost sexually. He wanted to gather her up in his arms, as he so often had Nicole, and cherish even her mistakes, so deeply were they part of her. The orange light through the drawn blind, the sarcophagus of her figure on the bed, the spot of face, the voice searching the vacuity of her illness and finding only remote abstractions.

As he arose the tears fled lava-like into her bandages.

“That is for something,” she whispered. “Something must come out of it.”

He stooped and kissed her forehead.

“We must all try to be good,” he said.

Leaving her room he sent the nurse in to her. There were other patients to see: an American girl of fifteen who had been brought up on the basis that childhood was intended to be all fun—his visit was provoked by the fact that she had just hacked off all her hair with a nail scissors. There was nothing much to be done for her—a family history of neurosis and nothing stable in her past to build on. The father, normal and conscientious himself, had tried to protect a nervous brood from life’s troubles and had succeeded merely in preventing them from developing powers of adjustment to life’s inevitable surprises. There was little that Dick could say:“Helen, when you’re in doubt you must ask a nurse, you must learn to take advice. Promise me you will.”

What was a promise with the head sick? He looked in upon a frail exile from the Caucasus buckled securely in a sort of hammock which in turn was submerged in a warm medical bath, and upon the three daughters of a Portuguese general who slid almost imperceptibly toward paresis. He went into the room next to them and told a collapsed psychiatrist that he was better, always better, and the man tried to read his face for conviction, since he hung on the real world only through such reassurance as he could find in the resonance, or lack of it, in Doctor Diver’s voice. After that Dick discharged a shiftless orderly and by then it was the lunch hour.





15


Meals with the patients were a chore he approached with apathy. The gathering, which of course did not include residents at the Eglantine or the Beeches, was conventional enough at first sight, but over it brooded always a heavy melancholy. Such doctors as were present kept up a conversation but most of the patients, as if exhausted by their morning’s endeavor, or depressed by the company, spoke little, and ate looking into their plates.

Luncheon over, Dick returned to his villa. Nicole was in the salon wearing a strange expression.

“Read that,” she said.

He opened the letter. It was from a woman recently discharged, though with skepticism on the part of the faculty. It accused him in no uncertain terms of having seduced her daughter, who had been at her mother’s side during the crucial stage of the illness. It presumed that Mrs. Diver would be glad to have this information and learn what her husband was “really like.”

Dick read the letter again. Couched in clear and concise English he yet recognized it as the letter of a maniac. Upon a single occasion he had let the girl, a flirtatious little brunette, ride into Zurich with him, upon her request, and in the evening had brought her back to the clinic. In an idle, almost indulgent way, he kissed her. Later, she tried to carry the affair further, but he was not interested and subsequently, probably consequently, the girl had come to dislike him, and taken her mother away.

“This letter is deranged,” he said. “I had no relations of any kind with that girl. I didn’t even like her.”

“Yes, I’ve tried thinking that,” said Nicole.

“Surely you don’t believe it?”

“I’ve been sitting here.”

He sank his voice to a reproachful note and sat beside her.

“This is absurd. This is a letter from a mental patient.”

“I was a mental patient.”

He stood up and spoke more authoritatively.

“Suppose we don’t have any nonsense, Nicole. Go and round up the children and we’ll start.”

In the car, with Dick driving, they followed the little promontories of the lake, catching the burn of light and water in the windshield, tunnelling through cascades of evergreen. It was Dick’s car, a Renault so dwarfish that they all stuck out of it except the children, between whom Mademoiselle towered mast-like in the rear seat. They knew every kilometer of the road—where they would smell the pine needles and the black stove smoke. A high sun with a face traced on it beat fierce on the straw hats of the children.

Nicole was silent; Dick was uneasy at her straight hard gaze. Often he felt lonely with her, and frequently she tired him with the short floods of personal revelations that she reserved exclusively for him, “I’m like this—I’m more like that,” but this afternoon he would have been glad had she rattled on in staccato for a while and given him glimpses of her thoughts. The situation was always most threatening when she backed up into herself and closed the doors behind her.

At Zug Mademoiselle got out and left them. The Divers approached the Agiri Fair through a menagerie of mammoth steam-rollers that made way for them. Dick parked the car, and as Nicole looked at him without moving, he said:“Come on, darl.” Her lips drew apart into a sudden awful smile, and his belly quailed, but as if he hadn’t seen it he repeated:“Come on. So the children can get out.”

“Oh, I’ll come all right,” she answered, tearing the words from some story spinning itself out inside her, too fast for him to grasp. “Don’t worry about that. I’ll come—”

“Then come.”

She turned from him as he walked beside her but the smile still flickered across her face, derisive and remote. Only when Lanier spoke to her several times did she manage to fix her attention upon an object, a Punch-and-Judy show, and to orient herself by anchoring to it.

Dick tried to think what to do. The dualism in his views of her—that of the husband, that of the psychiatrist—was increasingly paralyzing his faculties. In these six years she had several times carried him over the line with her, disarming him by exciting emotional pity or by a flow of wit, fantastic and disassociated, so that only after the episode did he realize with the consciousness of his own relaxation from tension, that she had succeeded in getting a point against his better judgment.

A discussion with Topsy about the guignol—as to whether the Punch was the same Punch they had seen last year in Cannes—having been settled, the family walked along again between the booths under the open sky. The women’s bonnets, perching over velvet vests, the bright, spreading skirts of many cantons, seemed demure against the blue and orange paint of the wagons and displays. There was the sound of a whining, tinkling hootchy-kootchy show.

Nicole began to run very suddenly, so suddenly that for a moment Dick did not miss her. Far ahead he saw her yellow dress twisting through the crowd, an ochre stitch along the edge of reality and unreality, and started after her. Secretly she ran and secretly he followed. As the hot afternoon went shrill and terrible with her flight he had forgotten the children; then he wheeled and ran back to them, drawing them this way and that by their arms, his eyes jumping from booth to booth.

“Madame,” he cried to a young woman behind a white lottery wheel,“Est-ce que je peux laisser ces petits avec vous deux minutes? C’est très urgent—je vous donnerai dix francs.”

“Mais oui.”

He headed the children into the booth. “Alors—restez avec cette gentille dame.”

“Oui, Dick.”

He darted off again but he had lost her; he circled the merry-go-round keeping up with it till he realized he was running beside it, staring always at the same horse. He elbowed through the crowd in the buvette; then remembering a predilection of Nicole’s he snatched up an edge of a fortune-teller’s tent and peered within. A droning voice greeted him:“La septième fille d’une septième fille née sur les rives du Nil—entrez, Monsieur—”

Dropping the flap he ran along toward where the plaisance terminated at the lake and a small ferris wheel revolved slowly against the sky. There he found her.

She was alone in what was momentarily the top boat of the wheel, and as it descended he saw that she was laughing hilariously; he slunk back in the crowd, a crowd which, at the wheel’s next revolution, spotted the intensity of Nicole’s hysteria.

“Regardez-moi ça!”

“Regarde donc cette Anglaise!”

Down she dropped again—this time the wheel and its music were slowing and a dozen people were around her car, all of them impelled by the quality of her laughter to smile in sympathetic idiocy. But when Nicole saw Dick her laughter died—she made a gesture of slipping by and away from him but he caught her arm and held it as they walked away.

“Why did you lose control of yourself like that?”

“You know very well why.”

“No, I don’t.”

“That’s just preposterous—let me loose—that’s an insult to my intelligence. Don’t you think I saw that girl look at you—that little dark girl. Oh, this is farcical—a child, not more than fifteen. Don’t you think I saw?”

“Stop here a minute and quiet down.”

They sat at a table, her eyes in a profundity of suspicion, her hand moving across her line of sight as if it were obstructed. “I want a drink—I want a brandy.”

“You can’t have brandy—you can have a bock if you want it.”

“Why can’t I have a brandy?”

“We won’t go into that. Listen to me—this business about a girl is a delusion, do you understand that word?”

“It’s always a delusion when I see what you don’t want me to see.”

He had a sense of guilt as in one of those nightmares where we are accused of a crime which we recognize as something undeniably experienced, but which upon waking we realize we have not committed. His eyes wavered from hers.

“I left the children with a gypsy woman in a booth. We ought to get them.”

“Who do you think you are?” she demanded. “Svengali?”

Fifteen minutes ago they had been a family. Now as she was crushed into a corner by his unwilling shoulder, he saw them all, child and man, as a perilous accident.

“We’re going home.”

“Home!” she roared in a voice so abandoned that its louder tones wavered and cracked. “And sit and think that we’re all rotting and the children’s ashes are rotting in every box I open? That filth!”

Almost with relief he saw that her words sterilized her, and Nicole, sensitized down to the corium of the skin, saw the withdrawal in his face. Her own face softened and she begged, “Help me, help me, Dick!”

A wave of agony went over him. It was awful that such a fine tower should not be erected, only suspended, suspended from him. Up to a point that was right: men were for that, beam and idea, girder and logarithm; but somehow Dick and Nicole had become one and equal, not opposite and complementary; she was Dick too, the drought in the marrow of his bones. He could not watch her disintegrations without participating in them. His intuition rilled out of him as tenderness and compassion—he could only take the characteristically modern course, to interpose—he would get a nurse from Zurich, to take her over to-night.

“You can help me.”

Her sweet bullying pulled him forward off his feet. “You’ve helped me before—you can help me now.”

“I can only help you the same old way.”

“Some one can help me.”

“Maybe so. You can help yourself most. Let’s find the children.”

There were numerous lottery booths with white wheels—Dick was startled when he inquired at the first and encountered blank disavowals. Evil-eyed, Nicole stood apart, denying the children, resenting them as part of a downright world she sought to make amorphous. Presently Dick found them, surrounded by women who were examining them with delight like fine goods, and by peasant children staring.

“Merci, Monsieur, ah Monsieur est trop généreux. C’était un plaisir, M’sieur, Madame. Au revoir, mes petits.”

They started back with a hot sorrow streaming down upon them; the car was weighted with their mutual apprehension and anguish, and the children’s mouths were grave with disappointment. Grief presented itself in its terrible, dark unfamiliar color. Somewhere around Zug, Nicole, with a convulsive effort, reiterated a remark she had made before about a misty yellow house set back from the road that looked like a painting not yet dry, but it was just an attempt to catch at a rope that was playing out too swiftly.

Dick tried to rest—the struggle would come presently at home and he might have to sit a long time, restating the universe for her. A “schizophrène” is well named as a split personality—Nicole was alternately a person to whom nothing need be explained and one to whom nothing could be explained. It was necessary to treat her with active and affirmative insistence, keeping the road to reality always open, making the road to escape harder going. But the brilliance, the versatility of madness is akin to the resourcefulness of water seeping through, over and around a dike. It requires the united front of many people to work against it. He felt it necessary that this time Nicole cure herself; he wanted to wait until she remembered the other times, and revolted from them. In a tired way, he planned that they would again resume the régime relaxed a year before.

He had turned up a hill that made a short cut to the clinic, and now as he stepped on the accelerator for a short straightaway run parallel to the hillside the car swerved violently left, swerved right, tipped on two wheels and, as Dick, with Nicole’s voice screaming in his ear, crushed down the mad hand clutching the steering wheel, righted itself, swerved once more and shot off the road; it tore through low underbrush, tipped again and settled slowly at an angle of ninety degrees against a tree.

The children were screaming and Nicole was screaming and cursing and trying to tear at Dick’s face. Thinking first of the list of the car and unable to estimate it Dick bent away Nicole’s arm, climbed over the top side and lifted out the children; then he saw the car was in a stable position. Before doing anything else he stood there shaking and panting.

“You—!” he cried.

She was laughing hilariously, unashamed, unafraid, unconcerned. No one coming on the scene would have imagined that she had caused it; she laughed as after some mild escape of childhood.

“You were scared, weren’t you?” she accused him. “You wanted to live!”

She spoke with such force that in his shocked state Dick wondered if he had been frightened for himself—but the strained faces of the children, looking from parent to parent, made him want to grind her grinning mask into jelly.

Directly above them, half a kilometer by the winding road but only a hundred yards climbing, was an inn; one of its wings showed through the wooded hill.

“Take Topsy’s hand,” he said to Lanier, “like that, tight, and climb up that hill—see the little path? When you get to the inn tell them ‘La voiture Divare est cassée.’ Some one must come right down.”

Lanier, not sure what had happened, but suspecting the dark and unprecedented, asked:

“What will you do, Dick?”

“We’ll stay here with the car.”

Neither of them looked at their mother as they started off. “Be careful crossing the road up there! Look both ways!” Dick shouted after them.

He and Nicole looked at each other directly, their eyes like blazing windows across a court of the same house. Then she took out a compact, looked in its mirror, and smoothed back the temple hair. Dick watched the children climbing for a moment until they disappeared among the pines half way up; then he walked around the car to see the damage and plan how to get it back on the road. In the dirt he could trace the rocking course they had pursued for over a hundred feet; he was filled with a violent disgust that was not like anger.

In a few minutes the proprietor of the inn came running down.

“My God!” he exclaimed. “How did it happen, were you going fast? What luck! Except for that tree you’d have rolled down hill!”

Taking advantage of Émile’s reality, the wide black apron, the sweat upon the rolls of his face, Dick signalled to Nicole in a matter-of-fact way to let him help her from the car; whereupon she jumped over the lower side, lost her balance on the slope, fell to her knees and got up again. As she watched the men trying to move the car her expression became defiant. Welcoming even that mood Dick said:

“Go and wait with the children, Nicole.”

Only after she had gone did he remember that she had wanted cognac, and that there was cognac available up there—he told Émile never mind about the car; they would wait for the chauffeur and the big car to pull it up onto the road. Together they hurried up to the inn.

“I want to go away,” he told Franz. “For a month or so, for as long as I can.”

“Why not, Dick? That was our original arrangement—it was you who insisted on staying. If you and Nicole—”

“I don’t want to go away with Nicole. I want to go away alone. This last thing knocked me sideways—if I get two hours’ sleep in twenty-four,it’s one of Zwingli’s miracles.”

“You wish a real leave of abstinence.”

“The word is ‘absence.’ Look here: if I go to Berlin to the Psychiatric Congress could you manage to keep the peace? For three months she’s been all right and she likes her nurse. My God, you’re the only human being in this world I can ask this of.”

Franz grunted, considering whether or not he could be trusted to think always of his partner’s interest.

In Zurich the next week Dick drove to the airport and took the big plane for Munich. Soaring and roaring into the blue he felt numb, realizing how tired he was. A vast persuasive quiet stole over him, and he abandoned sickness to the sick, sound to the motors, direction to the pilot. He had no intention of attending so much as a single session of the Congress—he could imagine it well enough, new pamphlets by Bleuler and the elder Forel that he could much better digest at home, the paper by the American who cured dementia præcox by pulling out his patient’s teeth or cauterizing their tonsils, the half-derisive respect with which this idea would be greeted, for no more reason than that America was such a rich and powerful country. The other delegates from America—red-headed Schwartz with his saint’s face and his infinite patience in straddling two worlds, as well as dozens of commercial alienists with hang-dog faces, who would be present partly to increase their standing, and hence their reach for the big plums of the criminal practice, partly to master novel sophistries that they could weave into their stock in trade, to the infinite confusion of all values. There would be cynical Latins, and some man of Freud’s from Vienna. Articulate among them would be the great Jung, bland, super-vigorous, on his rounds between the forests of anthropology and the neuroses of school-boys. At first there would be an American cast to the congress, almost Rotarian in its forms and ceremonies, then the closer-knit European vitality would fight through, and finally the Americans would play their trump card, the announcement of colossal gifts and endowments, of great new plants and training schools, and in the presence of the figures the Europeans would blanch and walk timidly. But he would not be there to see.

They skirted the Vorarlberg Alps, and Dick felt a pastoral delight in watching the villages. There were always four or five in sight, each one gathered around a church. It was simple looking at the earth from far off, simple as playing grim games with dolls and soldiers. This was the way statesmen and commanders and all retired people looked at things. Anyhow, it was a good draft of relief.

An Englishman spoke to him from across the aisle but he found something antipathetic in the English lately. England was like a rich man after a disastrous orgy who makes up to the household by chatting with them individually, when it is obvious to them that he is only trying to get back his self-respect in order to usurp his former power.

Dick had with him what magazines were available on the station quays: The Century, The Motion Picture, L’Illustration, and the Fliegende Blätter, but it was more fun to descend in his imagination into the villages and shake hands with the rural characters. He sat in the churches as he sat in his father’s church in Buffalo, amid the starchy must of Sunday clothes. He listened to the wisdom of the Near East, was Crucified, Died, and was Buried in the cheerful church, and once more worried between five or ten cents for the collection plate, because of the girl who sat in the pew behind.

The Englishman suddenly borrowed his magazines with a little small change of conversation, and Dick, glad to see them go, thought of the voyage ahead of him. Wolf-like under his sheep’s clothing of long-staple Australian wool, he considered the world of pleasure—the incorruptible Mediterranean with sweet old dirt caked in the olive trees, the peasant girl near Savona with a face as green and rose as the color of an illuminated missal. He would take her in his hands and snatch her across the border…

…but there he deserted her—he must press on toward the Isles of Greece, the cloudy waters of unfamiliar ports, the lost girl on shore, the moon of popular songs. A part of Dick’s mind was made up of the tawdry souvenirs of his boyhood. Yet in that somewhat littered Five-and-Ten, he had managed to keep alive the low painful fire of intelligence.

Tommy Barban was a ruler, Tommy was a hero—Dick happened upon him in the Marienplatz in Munich, in one of those cafés, where small gamblers diced on “tapestry” mats. The air was full of politics, and the slap of cards.

Tommy was at a table laughing his martial laugh:“Um-buh—ha-ha! Um-buh—ha-ha!” As a rule, he drank little; courage was his game and his companions were always a little afraid of him. Recently an eighth of the area of his skull had been removed by a Warsaw surgeon and was knitting under his hair, and the weakest person in the café could have killed him with a flip of a knotted napkin.

“—this is Prince Chillicheff—” A battered, powder-gray Russian of fifty, “—and Mr. McKibben—and Mr. Hannan—” the latter was a lively ball of black eyes and hair, a clown; and he said immediately to Dick:

“The first thing before we shake hands—what do you mean by fooling around with my aunt?”

“Why, I—”

“You heard me. What are you doing here in Munich anyhow?”

“Um-bah—ha-ha!” laughed Tommy.

“Haven’t you got aunts of your own? Why don’t you fool with them?”

Dick laughed, whereupon the man shifted his attack:

“Now let’s not have any more talk about aunts. How do I know you didn’t make up the whole thing? Here you are a complete stranger with an acquaintance of less than half an hour, and you come up to me with a cock-and-bull story about your aunts. How do I know what you have concealed about you?”

Tommy laughed again, then he said good-naturedly, but firmly,“That’s enough, Carly. Sit down, Dick—how’re you? How’s Nicole?”

He did not like any man very much nor feel their presence with much intensity—he was all relaxed for combat; as a fine athlete playing secondary defense in any sport is really resting much of the time, while a lesser man only pretends to rest and is at a continual and self-destroying nervous tension.

Hannan, not entirely suppressed, moved to an adjoining piano, and with recurring resentment on his face whenever he looked at Dick, played chords, from time to time muttering, “Your aunts,” and, in a dying cadence, “I didn’t say aunts anyhow. I said pants.”

“Well, how’re you?” repeated Tommy. “You don’t look so—” he fought for a word, “—so jaunty as you used to, so spruce, you know what I mean.”

The remark sounded too much like one of those irritating accusations of waning vitality and Dick was about to retort by commenting on the extraordinary suits worn by Tommy and Prince Chillicheff, suits of a cut and pattern fantastic enough to have sauntered down Beale Street on a Sunday—when an explanation was forthcoming.

“I see you are regarding our clothes,” said the Prince. “We have just come out of Russia.”

“These were made in Poland by the court tailor,” said Tommy. “That’s a fact—Pilsudski’s own tailor.”

“You’ve been touring?” Dick asked.

They laughed, the Prince inordinately meanwhile clapping Tommy on the back.

“Yes, we have been touring. That’s it, touring. We have made the grand Tour of all the Russias. In state.”

Dick waited for an explanation. It came from Mr. McKibben in two words.

“They escaped.”

“Have you been prisoners in Russia?”

“It was I,” explained Prince Chillicheff, his dead yellow eyes staring at Dick. “Not a prisoner but in hiding.”

“Did you have much trouble getting out?”

“Some trouble. We left three Red Guards dead at the border. Tommy left two—” He held up two fingers like a Frenchman—“I left one.”

“That’s the part I don’t understand,” said Mr. McKibben. “Why they should have objected to your leaving.”

Hannan turned from the piano and said, winking at the others:“Mac thinks a Marxian is somebody who went to St. Mark’s school.”

It was an escape story in the best tradition—an aristocrat hiding nine years with a former servant and working in a government bakery; the eighteen-year-old daughter in Paris who knew Tommy Barban…. During the narrative Dick decided that this parched papier mâché relic of the past was scarcely worth the lives of three young men. The question arose as to whether Tommy and Chillicheff had been frightened.

“When I was cold,” Tommy said. “I always get scared when I’m cold. During the war I was always frightened when I was cold.”

McKibben stood up.

“I must leave. To-morrow morning I’m going to Innsbruck by car with my wife and children—and the governess.”

“I’m going there to-morrow, too,” said Dick.

“Oh, are you?” exclaimed McKibben. “Why not come with us? It’s a big Packard and there’s only my wife and my children and myself—and the governess—”

“I can’t possibly—”

“Of course she’s not really a governess,” McKibben concluded, looking rather pathetically at Dick. “As a matter of fact my wife knows your sister-in-law, Baby Warren.”

But Dick was not to be drawn in a blind contract.

“I’ve promised to travel with two men.”

“Oh,” McKibben’s face fell. “Well, I’ll say good-by.” He unscrewed two blooded wire-hairs from a nearby table and departed; Dick pictured the jammed Packard pounding toward Innsbruck with the McKibbens and their children and their baggage and yapping dogs—and the governess.

“The paper says they know the man who killed him,” said Tommy.“But his cousins did not want it in the papers, because it happened in a speakeasy. What do you think of that?”

“It’s what’s known as family pride.”

Hannan played a loud chord on the piano to attract attention to himself.

“I don’t believe his first stuff holds up,” he said. “Even barring the Europeans there are a dozen Americans can do what North did.”

It was the first indication Dick had had that they were talking about Abe North.

“The only difference is that Abe did it first,” said Tommy.

“I don’t agree,” persisted Hannan. “He got the reputation for being a good musician because he drank so much that his friends had to explain him away somehow—”

“What’s this about Abe North? What about him? Is he in a jam?”

“Didn’t you read The Herald this morning?”

“No.”

“He’s dead. He was beaten to death in a speakeasy in New York. He just managed to crawl home to the Racquet Club to die—”

“Abe North?”

“Yes, sure, they—”

“Abe North?” Dick stood up. “Are you sure he’s dead?”

Hannan turned around to McKibben:“It wasn’t the Racquet Club he crawled to—it was the Harvard Club. I’m sure he didn’t belong to the Racquet.”

“The paper said so,” McKibben insisted.

“It must have been a mistake. I’m quite sure.”

“Beaten to death in a speakeasy.”

“But I happen to know most of the members of the Racquet Club,” said Hannan. “It must have been the Harvard Club.”

Dick got up, Tommy too. Prince Chillicheff started out of a wan study of nothing, perhaps of his chances of ever getting out of Russia, a study that had occupied him so long that it was doubtful if he could give it up immediately, and joined them in leaving.

“Abe North beaten to death.”

On the way to the hotel, a journey of which Dick was scarcely aware, Tommy said:

“We’re waiting for a tailor to finish some suits so we can get to Paris. I’m going into stock-broking and they wouldn’t take me if I showed up like this. Everybody in your country is making millions. Are you really leaving to-morrow? We can’t even have dinner with you. It seems the Prince had an old girl in Munich. He called her up but she’d been dead five years and we’re having dinner with the two daughters.”

The Prince nodded.

“Perhaps I could have arranged for Doctor Diver.”

“No, no,” said Dick hastily.

He slept deep and awoke to a slow mournful march passing his window. It was a long column of men in uniform, wearing the familiar helmet of 1914, thick men in frock coats and silk hats, burghers, aristocrats, plain men. It was a society of veterans going to lay wreaths on the tombs of the dead. The column marched slowly with a sort of swagger for a lost magnificence, a past effort, a forgotten sorrow. The faces were only formally sad but Dick’s lungs burst for a moment with regret for Abe’s death, and his own youth of ten years ago.





18


He reached Innsbruck at dusk, sent his bags up to a hotel and walked into town. In the sunset the Emperor Maximilian knelt in prayer above his bronze mourners; a quartet of Jesuit novices paced and read in the university garden. The marble souvenirs of old sieges, marriages, anniversaries, faded quickly when the sun was down, and he had Erbsen-suppe with Würstchen cut up in it, drank four Pilsener and refused a formidable dessert known as “Kaiserschmarren.”

Despite the overhanging mountains Switzerland was far away, Nicole was far away. Walking in the garden later when it was quite dark he thought about her with detachment, loving her for her best self. He remembered once when the grass was damp and she came to him on hurried feet, her thin slippers drenched with dew. She stood upon his shoes nestling close and held up her face, showing it as a book open at a page.

“Think how you love me,” she whispered. “I don’t ask you to love me always like this, but I ask you to remember. Somewhere inside me there’ll always be the person I am to-night.”

But Dick had come away for his soul’s sake, and he began thinking about that. He had lost himself—he could not tell the hour when, or the day or the week, the month or the year. Once he had cut through things, solving the most complicated equations as the simplest problems of his simplest patients. Between the time he found Nicole flowering under a stone on the Zürichsee and the moment of his meeting with Rosemary the spear had been blunted.

Watching his father’s struggles in poor parishes had wedded a desire for money to an essentially unacquisitive nature. It was not a healthy necessity for security—he had never felt more sure of himself, more thoroughly his own man, than at the time of his marriage to Nicole. Yet he had been swallowed up like a gigolo, and somehow permitted his arsenal to be locked up in the Warren safety-deposit vaults.

“There should have been a settlement in the Continental style; but it isn’t over yet. I’ve wasted eight years teaching the rich the ABC’s of human decency, but I’m not done. I’ve got too many unplayed trumps in my hand.”

He loitered among the fallow rose bushes and the beds of damp sweet indistinguishable fern. It was warm for October but cool enough to wear a heavy tweed coat buttoned by a little elastic tape at the neck. A figure detached itself from the black shape of a tree and he knew it was the woman whom he had passed in the lobby coming out. He was in love with every pretty woman he saw now, their forms at a distance, their shadows on a wall.

Her back was toward him as she faced the lights of the town. He scratched a match that she must have heard, but she remained motionless.

—Was it an invitation? Or an indication of obliviousness? He had long been outside of the world of simple desires and their fulfillments, and he was inept and uncertain. For all he knew there might be some code among the wanderers of obscure spas by which they found each other quickly.

—Perhaps the next gesture was his. Strange children should smile at each other and say, “Let’s play.”

He moved closer, the shadow moved sideways. Possibly he would be snubbed like the scapegrace drummers he had heard of in youth. His heart beat loud in contact with the unprobed, undissected, unanalyzed, unaccounted for. Suddenly he turned away, and, as he did, the girl, too, broke the black frieze she made with the foliage, rounded a bench at a moderate but determined pace and took the path back to the hotel.

With a guide and two other men, Dick started up the Birkkarspitze next morning. It was a fine feeling once they were above the cowbells of the highest pastures—Dick looked forward to the night in the shack, enjoying his own fatigue, enjoying the captaincy of the guide, feeling a delight in his own anonymity. But at mid-day the weather changed to black sleet and hail and mountain thunder. Dick and one of the other climbers wanted to go on but the guide refused. Regretfully they struggled back to Innsbruck to start again to-morrow.

After dinner and a bottle of heavy local wine in the deserted dining-room, he felt excited, without knowing why, until he began thinking of the garden. He had passed the girl in the lobby before supper and this time she had looked at him and approved of him, but it kept worrying him: Why? When I could have had a good share of the pretty women of my time for the asking, why start that now? With a wraith, with a fragment of my desire? Why?

His imagination pushed ahead—the old asceticism, the actual unfamiliarity, triumphed: God, I might as well go back to the Riviera and sleep with Janice Caricamento or the Wilburhazy girl. To belittle all these years with something cheap and easy?

He was still excited, though, and he turned from the veranda and went up to his room to think. Being alone in body and spirit begets loneliness, and loneliness begets more loneliness.

Upstairs he walked around thinking of the matter and laying out his climbing clothes advantageously on the faint heater; he again encountered Nicole’s telegram, still unopened, with which diurnally she accompanied his itinerary. He had delayed opening it before supper—perhaps because of the garden. It was a cablegram from Buffalo, forwarded through Zurich.

Your father died peacefully tonightHOLMES

He felt a sharp wince at the shock, a gathering of the forces of resistance; then it rolled up through his loins and stomach and throat.

He read the message again. He sat down on the bed, breathing and staring; thinking first the old selfish child’s thought that comes with the death of a parent, how will it affect me now that this earliest and strongest of protections is gone?

The atavism passed and he walked the room still, stopping from time to time to look at the telegram. Holmes was formally his father’s curate but actually, and for a decade, rector of the church. How did he die? Of old age—he was seventy-five. He had lived a long time.

Dick felt sad that he had died alone—he had survived his wife, and his brothers and sisters; there were cousins in Virginia but they were poor and not able to come North, and Holmes had had to sign the telegram. Dick loved his father—again and again he referred judgments to what his father would probably have thought or done. Dick was born several months after the death of two young sisters and his father, guessing what would be the effect on Dick’s mother, had saved him from a spoiling by becoming his moral guide. He was of tired stock yet he raised himself to that effort.

In the summer father and son walked downtown together to have their shoes shined—Dick in his starched duck sailor suit, his father always in beautifully cut clerical clothes—and the father was very proud of his handsome little boy. He told Dick all he knew about life, not much but most of it true, simple things, matters of behavior that came within his clergyman’s range. “Once in a strange town when I was first ordained, I went into a crowded room and was confused as to who was my hostess. Several people I knew came toward me, but I disregarded them because I had seen a gray-haired woman sitting by a window far across the room. I went over to her and introduced myself. After that I made many friends in that town.”

His father had done that from a good heart—his father had been sure of what he was, with a deep pride of the two proud widows who had raised him to believe that nothing could be superior to “good instincts,” honor, courtesy, and courage.

The father always considered that his wife’s small fortune belonged to his son, and in college and in medical school sent him a check for all of it four times a year. He was one of those about whom it was said with smug finality in the gilded age:“very much the gentleman, but not much get-up-and-go about him.”

…Dick sent down for a newspaper. Still pacing to and from the telegram open on his bureau, he chose a ship to go to America. Then he put in a call for Nicole in Zurich, remembering so many things as he waited, and wishing he had always been as good as he had intended to be.





19


For an hour, tied up with his profound reaction to his father’s death, the magnificent façade of the homeland, the harbor of New York, seemed all sad and glorious to Dick, but once ashore the feeling vanished, nor did he find it again in the streets or the hotels or the trains that bore him first to Buffalo, and then south to Virginia with his father’s body. Only as the local train shambled into the low-forested clayland of Westmoreland County did he feel once more identified with his surroundings; at the station he saw a star he knew, and a cold moon bright over Chesapeake Bay; he heard the rasping wheels of buckboards turning, the lovely fatuous voices, the sound of sluggish primeval rivers flowing softly under soft Indian names.

Next day at the churchyard his father was laid among a hundred Divers, Dorseys, and Hunters. It was very friendly leaving him there with all his relations around him. Flowers were scattered on the brown unsettled earth. Dick had no more ties here now and did not believe he would come back. He knelt on the hard soil. These dead, he knew them all, their weather-beaten faces with blue flashing eyes, the spare violent bodies, the souls made of new earth in the forest-heavy darkness of the seventeenth century.

“Good-by, my father—good-by, all my fathers.”

On the long-roofed steamship piers one is in a country that is no longer here and not yet there. The hazy yellow vault is full of echoing shouts. There are the rumble of trucks and the clump of trunks, the strident chatter of cranes, the first salt smell of the sea. One hurries through, even though there’s time; the past, the continent, is behind; the future is the glowing mouth in the side of the ship; the dim, turbulent alley is too confusedly the present.

Up the gangplank and the vision of the world adjusts itself, narrows. One is a citizen of a commonwealth smaller than Andorra, no longer sure of anything. The men at the purser’s desk are as oddly shaped as the cabins; disdainful are the eyes of voyagers and their friends. Next the loud mournful whistles, the portentous vibration and the boat, the human idea—is in motion. The pier and its faces slide by and for a moment the boat is a piece accidentally split off from them; the faces become remote, voiceless, the pier is one of many blurs along the water front. The harbor flows swiftly toward the sea.

With it flowed Albert McKisco, labelled by the newspapers as its most precious cargo. McKisco was having a vogue. His novels were pastiches of the work of the best people of his time, a feat not to be disparaged, and in addition he possessed a gift for softening and debasing what he borrowed, so that many readers were charmed by the ease with which they could follow him. Success had improved him and humbled him. He was no fool about his capacities—he realized that he possessed more vitality than many men of superior talent, and he was resolved to enjoy the success he had earned. “I’ve done nothing yet,” he would say.“I don’t think I’ve got any real genius. But if I keep trying I may write a good book.” Fine dives have been made from flimsier spring-boards. The innumerable snubs of the past were forgotten. Indeed, his success was founded psychologically upon his duel with Tommy Barban, upon the basis of which, as it withered in his memory, he had created, afresh, a new self-respect.

Spotting Dick Diver the second day out, he eyed him tentatively, then introduced himself in a friendly way and sat down. Dick laid aside his reading and, after the few minutes that it took to realize the change in McKisco, the disappearance of the man’s annoying sense of inferiority,found himself pleased to talk to him. McKisco was “well-informed” on a range of subjects wider than Goethe’s—it was interesting to listen to the innumerable facile combinations that he referred to as his opinions. They struck up an acquaintance, and Dick had several meals with them. The McKiscos had been invited to sit at the captain’s table but with nascent snobbery they told Dick that they “couldn’t stand that bunch.”

Violet was very grand now, decked out by the grand couturières, charmed about the little discoveries that well-bred girls make in their teens. She could, indeed, have learned them from her mother in Boise but her soul was born dismally in the small movie houses of Idaho, and she had had no time for her mother. Now she “belonged”—together with several million other people—and she was happy, though her husband still shushed her when she grew violently naïve.

The McKiscos got off at Gibraltar. Next evening in Naples Dick picked up a lost and miserable family of two girls and their mother in the bus from the hotel to the station. He had seen them on the ship. An overwhelming desire to help, or to be admired, came over him: he showed them fragments of gaiety; tentatively he bought them wine, with pleasure saw them begin to regain their proper egotism. He pretended they were this and that, and falling in with his own plot, and drinking too much to sustain the illusion, and all this time the women thought only that this was a windfall from heaven. He withdrew from them as the night waned and the train rocked and snorted at Cassino and Frosinone. After weird American partings in the station at Rome, Dick went to the Hotel Quirinal, somewhat exhausted.

At the desk he suddenly stared and upped his head. As if a drink were acting on him, warming the lining of his stomach, throwing a flush up into his brain, he saw the person he had come to see, the person for whom he had made the Mediterranean crossing.

Simultaneously Rosemary saw him, acknowledging him before placing him; she looked back startled, and, leaving the girl she was with, she hurried over. Holding himself erect, holding his breath, Dick turned to her. As she came across the lobby, her beauty all groomed, like a young horse dosed with black-seed oil, and hoops varnished, shocked him awake; but it all came too quick for him to do anything except conceal his fatigue as best he could. To meet her starry-eyed confidence he mustered an insincere pantomime implying, “You would turn up here—of all the people in the world.”

Her gloved hands closed over his on the desk;“Dick—we’re making‘The Grandeur that was Rome’—at least we think we are; we may quit any day.”

He looked at her hard, trying to make her a little self-conscious, so that she would observe less closely his unshaven face, his crumpled and slept-in collar. Fortunately, she was in a hurry.

“We begin early because the mists rise at eleven—phone me at two.”

In his room Dick collected his faculties. He left a call for noon, stripped off his clothes and dove literally into a heavy sleep.

He slept over the phone call but awoke at two, refreshed. Unpacking his bag, he sent out suits and laundry. He shaved, lay for half an hour in a warm bath and had breakfast. The sun had dipped into the Via Nazionale and he let it through the portières with a jingling of old brass rings. Waiting for a suit to be pressed, he discovered from the Corriere della Sera that “una novella di Sainclair Lewis ‘Wall Street’ nella quale l’autore analizza la vita sociale di una piccola città Americana.” Then he tried to think about Rosemary.

At first he thought nothing. She was young and magnetic, but so was Topsy. He guessed that she had had lovers and had loved them in the last four years. Well, you never knew exactly how much space you occupied in people’s lives. Yet from this fog his affection emerged—the best contacts are when one knows the obstacles and still wants to preserve a relation. The past drifted back and he wanted to hold her eloquent giving-of-herself in its precious shell, till he enclosed it, till it no longer existed outside him. He tried to collect all that might attract her—it was less than it had been four years ago. Eighteen might look at thirty-four through a rising mist of adolescence; but twenty-two would see thirty-eight with discerning clarity. Moreover, Dick had been at an emotional peak at the time of the previous encounter; since then there had been a lesion of enthusiasm.

When the valet returned he put on a white shirt and collar and a black tie with a pearl; the cords of his reading-glasses passed through another pearl of the same size that swung a casual inch below. After sleep, his face had resumed the ruddy brown of many Riviera summers, and to limber himself up he stood on his hands on a chair until his fountain pen and coins fell out. At three he called Rosemary and was bidden to come up. Momentarily dizzy from his acrobatics, he stopped in the bar for a gin-and-tonic.

“Hi, Doctor Diver!”

Only because of Rosemary’s presence in the hotel did Dick place the man immediately as Collis Clay. He had his old confidence and an air of prosperity and big sudden jowls.

“Do you know Rosemary’s here?” Collis asked.

“I ran into her.”

“I was in Florence and I heard she was here so I came down last week. You’d never know Mama’s little girl.” He modified the remark,“I mean she was so carefully brought up and now she’s a woman of the world—if you know what I mean. Believe me, has she got some of these Roman boys tied up in bags! And how!”

“You studying in Florence?”

“Me? Sure, I’m studying architecture there. I go back Sunday—I’m staying for the races.”

With difficulty Dick restrained him from adding the drink to the account he carried in the bar, like a stock-market report.





20


When Dick got out of the elevator he followed a tortuous corridor and turned at length toward a distant voice outside a lighted door. Rosemary was in black pajamas; a luncheon table was still in the room; she was having coffee.

“You’re still beautiful,” he said. “A little more beautiful than ever.”

“Do you want coffee, youngster?”

“I’m sorry I was so unpresentable this morning.”

“You didn’t look well—you all right now? Want coffee?”

“No, thanks.”

“You’re fine again, I was scared this morning. Mother’s coming over next month, if the company stays. She always asks me if I’ve seen you over here, as if she thought we were living next door. Mother always liked you—she always felt you were someone I ought to know.”

“Well, I’m glad she still thinks of me.”

“Oh, she does,” Rosemary reassured him. “A very great deal.”

“I’ve seen you here and there in pictures,” said Dick. “Once I had‘Daddy’s Girl’ run off just for myself!”

“I have a good part in this one if it isn’t cut.”

She crossed behind him, touching his shoulder as she passed. She phoned for the table to be taken away and settled in a big chair.

“I was just a little girl when I met you, Dick. Now I’m a woman.”

“I want to hear everything about you.”

“How is Nicole—and Lanier and Topsy?”

“They’re fine. They often speak of you—”

The phone rang. While she answered it Dick examined two novels—one by Edna Ferber, one by Albert McKisco. The waiter came for the table; bereft of its presence Rosemary seemed more alone in her black pajamas.

“…I have a caller…. No, not very well. I’ve got to go to the costumer’s for a long fitting…. No, not now….”

As though with the disappearance of the table she felt released, Rosemary smiled at Dick—that smile as if they two together had managed to get rid of all the trouble in the world and were now at peace in their own heaven….

“That’s done,” she said. “Do you realize I’ve spent the last hour getting ready for you?”

But again the phone called her. Dick got up to change his hat from the bed to the luggage stand, and in alarm Rosemary put her hand over the mouthpiece of the phone. “You’re not going!”

“No.”

When the communication was over he tried to drag the afternoon together saying:“I expect some nourishment from people now.”

“Me too,” Rosemary agreed. “The man that just phoned me once knew a second cousin of mine. Imagine calling anybody up for a reason like that!”

Now she lowered the lights for love. Why else should she want to shut off his view of her? He sent his words to her like letters, as though they left him some time before they reached her.

“Hard to sit here and be close to you, and not kiss you.” Then they kissed passionately in the centre of the floor. She pressed against him, and went back to her chair.

It could not go on being merely pleasant in the room. Forward or backward; when the phone rang once more he strolled into the bedchamber and lay down on her bed, opening Albert McKisco’s novel. Presently Rosemary came in and sat beside him.

“You have the longest eyelashes,” she remarked.

“We are now back at the Junior Prom. Among those present are Miss Rosemary Hoyt, the eyelash fancier—”

She kissed him and he pulled her down so that they lay side by side, and then they kissed till they were both breathless. Her breathing was young and eager and exciting. Her lips were faintly chapped but soft in the corners.

When they were still limbs and feet and clothes, struggles of his arms and back, and her throat and breasts, she whispered, “No, not now—those things are rhythmic.”

Disciplined he crushed his passion into a corner of his mind, but bearing up her fragility on his arms until she was poised half a foot above him, he said lightly:

“Darling—that doesn’t matter.”

Her face had changed with his looking up at it; there was the eternal moonlight in it.

“That would be poetic justice if it should be you,” she said. She twisted away from him, walked to the mirror, and boxed her disarranged hair with her hands. Presently she drew a chair close to the bed and stroked his cheek.

“Tell me the truth about you,” he demanded.

“I always have.”

“In a way—but nothing hangs together.”

They both laughed but he pursued.

“Are you actually a virgin?”

“No-o-o!” she sang. “I’ve slept with six hundred and forty men—if that’s the answer you want.”

“It’s none of my business.”

“Do you want me for a case in psychology?”

“Looking at you as a perfectly normal girl of twenty-two, living in the year nineteen twenty-eight, I guess you’ve taken a few shots at love.”

“It’s all been—abortive,” she said.

Dick couldn’t believe her. He could not decide whether she was deliberately building a barrier between them or whether this was intended to make an eventual surrender more significant.

“Let’s go walk in the Pincio,” he suggested.

He shook himself straight in his clothes and smoothed his hair. A moment had come and somehow passed. For three years Dick had been the ideal by which Rosemary measured other men and inevitably his stature had increased to heroic size. She did not want him to be like other men, yet here were the same exigent demands, as if he wanted to take some of herself away, carry it off in his pocket.

Walking on the greensward between cherubs and philosophers, fauns and falling water, she took his arm snugly, settling into it with a series of little readjustments, as if she wanted it to be right because it was going to be there forever. She plucked a twig and broke it, but she found no spring in it. Suddenly seeing what she wanted in Dick’s face she took his gloved hand and kissed it. Then she cavorted childishly for him until he smiled and she laughed and they began having a good time.

“I can’t go out with you to-night, darling, because I promised some people a long time ago. But if you’ll get up early I’ll take you out to the set to-morrow.”

He dined alone at the hotel, went to bed early, and met Rosemary in the lobby at half-past six. Beside him in the car she glowed away fresh and new in the morning sunshine. They went out through the Porta San Sebastiano and along the Appian Way until they came to the huge set of the Forum, larger than the Forum itself. Rosemary turned him over to a man who led him about the great props; the arches and tiers of seats and the sanded arena. She was working on a stage which represented a guard-room for Christian prisoners, and presently they went there and watched Nicotera, one of many hopeful Valentinos, strut and pose before a dozen female “captives,” their eyes melancholy and startling with mascara.

Rosemary appeared in a knee-length tunic.

“Watch this,” she whispered to Dick. “I want your opinion. Everybody that’s seen the rushes says—”

“What are the rushes?”

“When they run off what they took the day before. They say it’s the first thing I’ve had sex appeal in.”

“I don’t notice it.”

“You wouldn’t! But I have.”

Nicotera in his leopard skin talked attentively to Rosemary while the electrician discussed something with the director, meanwhile leaning on him. Finally the director pushed his hand off roughly and wiped a sweating forehead, and Dick’s guide remarked:“He’s on the hop again, and how!”

“Who?” asked Dick, but before the man could answer the director walked swiftly over to them.

“Who’s on the hop—you’re on the hop yourself.” He spoke vehemently to Dick, as if to a jury. “When he’s on the hop he always thinks everybody else is, and how!” He glared at the guide a moment longer, then he clapped his hands:“All right—everybody on the set.”

It was like visiting a great turbulent family. An actress approached Dick and talked to him for five minutes under the impression that he was an actor recently arrived from London. Discovering her mistake she scuttled away in panic. The majority of the company felt either sharply superior or sharply inferior to the world outside, but the former feeling prevailed. They were people of bravery and industry; they were risen to a position of prominence in a nation that for a decade had wanted only to be entertained.

The session ended as the light grew misty—a fine light for painters, but, for the camera, not to be compared with the clear California air. Nicotera followed Rosemary to the car and whispered something to her—she looked at him without smiling as she said good-by.

Dick and Rosemary had luncheon at the Castelli dei Caesari, a splendid restaurant in a high-terraced villa overlooking the ruined forum of an undetermined period of the decadence. Rosemary took a cocktail and a little wine, and Dick took enough so that his feeling of dissatisfaction left him. Afterward they drove back to the hotel, all flushed and happy, in a sort of exalted quiet. She wanted to be taken and she was, and what had begun with a childish infatuation on a beach was accomplished at last.





21


Rosemary had another dinner date, a birthday party for a member of the company. Dick ran into Collis Clay in the lobby, but he wanted to dine alone, and pretended an engagement at the Excelsior. He drank a cocktail with Collis and his vague dissatisfaction crystallized as impatience—he no longer had an excuse for playing truant to the clinic. This was less an infatuation than a romantic memory. Nicole was his girl—too often he was sick at heart about her, yet she was his girl. Time with Rosemary was self-indulgence—time with Collis was nothing plus nothing.

In the doorway of the Excelsior he ran into Baby Warren. Her large beautiful eyes, looking precisely like marbles, stared at him with surprise and curiosity. “I thought you were in America, Dick! Is Nicole with you?”

“I came back by way of Naples.”

The black band on his arm reminded her to say:“I’m so sorry to hear of your trouble.”

Inevitably they dined together. “Tell me about everything,” she demanded.

Dick gave her a version of the facts, and Baby frowned. She found it necessary to blame someone for the catastrophe in her sister’s life.

“Do you think Doctor Dohmler took the right course with her from the first?”

“There’s not much variety in treatment any more—of course you try to find the right personality to handle a particular case.”

“Dick, I don’t pretend to advise you or to know much about it but don’t you think a change might be good for her—to get out of that atmosphere of sickness and live in the world like other people?”

“But you were keen for the clinic,” he reminded her. “You told me you’d never feel really safe about her—”

“That was when you were leading that hermit’s life on the Riviera, up on a hill way off from anybody. I didn’t mean to go back to that life. I meant, for instance, London. The English are the best-balanced race in the world.”

“They are not,” he disagreed.

“They are. I know them, you see. I meant it might be nice for you to take a house in London for the spring season—I know a dove of a house in Talbot Square you could get, furnished. I mean, living with sane, well-balanced English people.”

She would have gone on to tell him all the old propaganda stories of 1914 if he had not laughed and said:

“I’ve been reading a book by Michael Arlen and if that’s—”

She ruined Michael Arlen with a wave of her salad spoon.

“He only writes about degenerates. I mean the worthwhile English.”

As she thus dismissed her friends they were replaced in Dick’s mind only by a picture of the alien, unresponsive faces that peopled the small hotels of Europe.

“Of course it’s none of my business,” Baby repeated, as a preliminary to a further plunge, “but to leave her alone in an atmosphere like that—”

“I went to America because my father died.”

“I understand that, I told you how sorry I was.” She fiddled with the glass grapes on her necklace. “But there’s so much money now. Plenty for everything, and it ought to be used to get Nicole well.”

“For one thing I can’t see myself in London.”

“Why not? I should think you could work there as well as anywhere else.”

He sat back and looked at her. If she had ever suspected the rotted old truth, the real reason for Nicole’s illness, she had certainly determined to deny it to herself, shoving it back in a dusty closet like one of the paintings she bought by mistake.

They continued the conversation in the Ulpia, where Collis Clay came over to their table and sat down, and a gifted guitar player thrummed and rumbled “Suona Fanfara Mia” in the cellar piled with wine casks.

“It’s possible that I was the wrong person for Nicole,” Dick said.“Still she would probably have married someone of my type, someone she thought she could rely on—indefinitely.”

“You think she’d be happier with somebody else?” Baby thought aloud suddenly. “Of course it could be arranged.”

Only as she saw Dick bend forward with helpless laughter did she realize the preposterousness of her remark.

“Oh, you understand,” she assured him. “Don’t think for a moment that we’re not grateful for all you’ve done. And we know you’ve had a hard time—”

“For God’s sake,” he protested. “If I didn’t love Nicole it might be different.”

“But you do love Nicole?” she demanded in alarm.

Collis was catching up with the conversation now and Dick switched it quickly:“Suppose we talk about something else—about you, for instance. Why don’t you get married? We heard you were engaged to Lord Paley, the cousin of the—”

“Oh, no.” She became coy and elusive. “That was last year.”

“Why don’t you marry?” Dick insisted stubbornly.

“I don’t know. One of the men I loved was killed in the war, and the other one threw me over.”

“Tell me about it. Tell me about your private life, Baby, and your opinions. You never do—we always talk about Nicole.”

“Both of them were Englishmen. I don’t think there’s any higher type in the world than a first-rate Englishman, do you? If there is I haven’t met him. This man—oh, it’s a long story. I hate long stories, don’t you?”

“And how!” said Collis.

“Why, no—I like them if they’re good.”

“That’s something you do so well, Dick. You can keep a party moving by just a little sentence or a saying here and there. I think that’s a wonderful talent.”

“It’s a trick,” he said gently. That made three of her opinions he disagreed with.

“Of course I like formality—I like things to be just so, and on the grand scale. I know you probably don’t but you must admit it’s a sign of solidity in me.”

Dick did not even bother to dissent from this.

“Of course I know people say, Baby Warren is racing around over Europe, chasing one novelty after another, and missing the best things in life, but I think on the contrary that I’m one of the few people who really go after the best things. I’ve known the most interesting people of my time.” Her voice blurred with the tinny drumming of another guitar number, but she called over it, “I’ve made very few big mistakes—”

—Only the very big ones, Baby.

She had caught something facetious in his eye and she changed the subject. It seemed impossible for them to hold anything in common. But he admired something in her, and he deposited her at the Excelsior with a series of compliments that left her shimmering.

Rosemary insisted on treating Dick to lunch next day. They went to a little trattoria kept by an Italian who had worked in America, and ate ham and eggs and waffles. Afterward, they went to the hotel. Dick’s discovery that he was not in love with her, nor she with him, had added to rather than diminished his passion for her. Now that he knew he would not enter further into her life, she became the strange woman for him. He supposed many men meant no more than that when they said they were in love—not a wild submergence of soul, a dipping of all colors into an obscuring dye, such as his love for Nicole had been. Certain thoughts about Nicole, that she should die, sink into mental darkness, love another man, made him physically sick.

Nicotera was in Rosemary’s sitting-room, chattering about a professional matter. When Rosemary gave him his cue to go, he left with humorous protests and a rather insolent wink at Dick. As usual the phone clamored and Rosemary was engaged at it for ten minutes, to Dick’s increasing impatience.

“Let’s go up to my room,” he suggested, and she agreed.

She lay across his knees on a big sofa; he ran his fingers through the lovely forelocks of her hair.

“Let me be curious about you again?” he asked.

“What do you want to know?”

“About men. I’m curious, not to say prurient.”

“You mean how long after I met you?”

“Or before.”

“Oh, no.” She was shocked. “There was nothing before. You were the first man I cared about. You’re still the only man I really care about.” She considered. “It was about a year, I think.”

“Who was it?”

“Oh, a man.”

He closed in on her evasion.

“I’ll bet I can tell you about it: the first affair was unsatisfactory and after that there was a long gap. The second was better, but you hadn’t been in love with the man in the first place. The third was all right—”

Torturing himself he ran on. “Then you had one real affair that fell of its own weight, and by that time you were getting afraid that you wouldn’t have anything to give to the man you finally loved.” He felt increasingly Victorian. “Afterwards there were half a dozen just episodic affairs, right up to the present. Is that close?”

She laughed between amusement and tears.

“It’s about as wrong as it could be,” she said, to Dick’s relief. “But some day I’m going to find somebody and love him and love him and never let him go.”

Now his phone rang and Dick recognized Nicotera’s voice, asking for Rosemary. He put his palm over the transmitter.

“Do you want to talk to him?”

She went to the phone and jabbered in a rapid Italian Dick could not understand.

“This telephoning takes time,” he said. “It’s after four and I have an engagement at five. You better go play with Signor Nicotera.”

“Don’t be silly.”

“Then I think that while I’m here you ought to count him out.”

“It’s difficult.” She was suddenly crying. “Dick, I do love you, never anybody like you. But what have you got for me?”

“What has Nicotera got for anybody?”

“That’s different.”

—Because youth called to youth.

“He’s a spic!” he said. He was frantic with jealousy, he didn’t want to be hurt again.

“He’s only a baby,” she said, sniffling. “You know I’m yours first.”

In reaction he put his arms about her but she relaxed wearily backward; he held her like that for a moment as in the end of an adagio, her eyes closed, her hair falling straight back like that of a girl drowned.

“Dick, let me go. I never felt so mixed up in my life.”

He was a gruff red bird and instinctively she drew away from him as his unjustified jealousy began to snow over the qualities of consideration and understanding with which she felt at home.

“I want to know the truth,” he said.

“Yes, then. We’re a lot together, he wants to marry me, but I don’t want to. What of it? What do you expect me to do? You never asked me to marry you. Do you want me to play around forever with half-wits like Collis Clay?”

“You were with Nicotera last night?”

“That’s none of your business,” she sobbed. “Excuse me, Dick, it is your business. You and Mother are the only two people in the world I care about.”

“How about Nicotera?”

“How do I know?”

She had achieved the elusiveness that gives hidden significance to the least significant remarks.

“Is it like you felt toward me in Paris?”

“I feel comfortable and happy when I’m with you. In Paris it was different. But you never know how you once felt. Do you?”

He got up and began collecting his evening clothes—if he had to bring all the bitterness and hatred of the world into his heart, he was not going to be in love with her again.

“I don’t care about Nicotera!” she declared. “But I’ve got to go to Livorno with the company to-morrow. Oh, why did this have to happen?” There was a new flood of tears. “It’s such a shame. Why did you come here? Why couldn’t we just have the memory anyhow? I feel as if I’d quarrelled with Mother.”

As he began to dress, she got up and went to the door.

“I won’t go to the party to-night.” It was her last effort. “I’ll stay with you. I don’t want to go anyhow.”

The tide began to flow again, but he retreated from it.

“I’ll be in my room,” she said. “Good-by, Dick.”

“Good-by.”

“Oh, such a shame, such a shame. Oh, such a shame. What’s it all about anyhow?”

“I’ve wondered for a long time.”

“But why bring it to me?”

“I guess I’m the Black Death,” he said slowly. “I don’t seem to bring people happiness any more.”





22


There were five people in the Quirinal bar after dinner, a high-class Italian frail who sat on a stool making persistent conversation against the bartender’s bored:“Si… Si… Si,” a light, snobbish Egyptian who was lonely but chary of the woman, and the two Americans.

Dick was always vividly conscious of his surroundings, while Collis Clay lived vaguely, the sharpest impressions dissolving upon a recording apparatus that had early atrophied, so the former talked and the latter listened, like a man sitting in a breeze.

Dick, worn away by the events of the afternoon, was taking it out on the inhabitants of Italy. He looked around the bar as if he hoped an Italian had heard him and would resent his words.

“This afternoon I had tea with my sister-in-law at the Excelsior. We got the last table and two men came up and looked around for a table and couldn’t find one. So one of them came up to us and said, ‘Isn’t this table reserved for the Princess Orsini?’ and I said:‘There was no sign on it,’ and he said:‘But I think it’s reserved for the Princess Orsini.’ I couldn’t even answer him.”

“What’d he do?”

“He retired.” Dick switched around in his chair. “I don’t like these people. The other day I left Rosemary for two minutes in front of a store and an officer started walking up and down in front of her, tipping his hat.”

“I don’t know,” said Collis after a moment. “I’d rather be here than up in Paris with somebody picking your pocket every minute.”

He had been enjoying himself, and he held out against anything that threatened to dull his pleasure.

“I don’t know,” he persisted. “I don’t mind it here.”

Dick evoked the picture that the few days had imprinted on his mind, and stared at it. The walk toward the American Express past the odorous confectioneries of the Via Nazionale, through the foul tunnel up to the Spanish Steps, where his spirit soared before the flower stalls and the house where Keats had died. He cared only about people; he was scarcely conscious of places except for their weather, until they had been invested with color by tangible events. Rome was the end of his dream of Rosemary.

A bell-boy came in and gave him a note.

“I did not go to the party,” it said. “I am in my room. We leave for Livorno early in the morning.”

Dick handed the note and a tip to the boy.

“Tell Miss Hoyt you couldn’t find me.” Turning to Collis he suggested the Bonbonieri.

They inspected the tart at the bar, granting her the minimum of interest exacted by her profession, and she stared back with bright boldness; they went through the deserted lobby oppressed by draperies holding Victorian dust in stuffy folds, and they nodded at the night concierge who returned the gesture with the bitter servility peculiar to night servants. Then in a taxi they rode along cheerless streets through a dank November night. There were no women in the streets, only pale men with dark coats buttoned to the neck, who stood in groups beside shoulders of cold stone.

“My God!” Dick sighed.

“What’s a matter?”

“I was thinking of that man this afternoon:‘This table is reserved for the Princess Orsini.’ Do you know what these old Roman families are? They’re bandits, they’re the ones who got possession of the temples and palaces after Rome went to pieces and preyed on the people.”

“I like Rome,” insisted Collis. “Why won’t you try the races?”

“I don’t like races.”

“But all the women turn out—”

“I know I wouldn’t like anything here. I like France, where everybody thinks he’s Napoleon—down here everybody thinks he’s Christ.”

At the Bonbonieri they descended to a panelled cabaret, hopelessly impermanent amid the cold stone. A listless band played a tango and a dozen couples covered the wide floor with those elaborate and dainty steps so offensive to the American eye. A surplus of waiters precluded the stir and bustle that even a few busy men can create; over the scene as its form of animation brooded an air of waiting for something, for the dance, the night, the balance of forces which kept it stable, to cease. It assured the impressionable guest that whatever he was seeking he would not find it here.

This was plain as plain to Dick. He looked around, hoping his eye would catch on something, so that spirit instead of imagination could carry on for an hour. But there was nothing and after a moment he turned back to Collis. He had told Collis some of his current notions, and he was bored with his audience’s short memory and lack of response. After half an hour of Collis he felt a distinct lesion of his own vitality.

They drank a bottle of Italian mousseux, and Dick became pale and somewhat noisy. He called the orchestra leader over to their table; this was a Bahama Negro, conceited and unpleasant, and in a few minutes there was a row.

“You asked me to sit down.”

“All right. And I gave you fifty lire, didn’t I?”

“All right. All right. All right.”

“All right, I gave you fifty lire, didn’t I? Then you come up and asked me to put some more in the horn!”

“You asked me to sit down, didn’t you? Didn’t you?”

“I asked you to sit down but I gave you fifty lire, didn’t I?”

“All right. All right.”

The Negro got up sourly and went away, leaving Dick in a still more evil humor. But he saw a girl smiling at him from across the room and immediately the pale Roman shapes around him receded into decent, humble perspective. She was a young English girl, with blonde hair and a healthy, pretty English face and she smiled at him again with an invitation he understood, that denied the flesh even in the act of tendering it.

“There’s a quick trick or else I don’t know bridge,” said Collis.

Dick got up and walked to her across the room.

“Won’t you dance?”

The middle-aged Englishman with whom she was sitting said, almost apologetically:“I’m going out soon.”

Sobered by excitement Dick danced. He found in the girl a suggestion of all the pleasant English things; the story of safe gardens ringed around by the sea was implicit in her bright voice and as he leaned back to look at her, he meant what he said to her so sincerely that his voice trembled. When her current escort should leave, she promised to come and sit with them. The Englishman accepted her return with repeated apologies and smiles.

Back at his table Dick ordered another bottle of spumante.

“She looks like somebody in the movies,” he said. “I can’t think who.” He glanced impatiently over his shoulder. “Wonder what’s keeping her?”

“I’d like to get in the movies,” said Collis thoughtfully. “I’m supposed to go into my father’s business but it doesn’t appeal to me much. Sit in an office in Birmingham for twenty years—”

His voice resisted the pressure of materialistic civilization.

“Too good for it?” suggested Dick.

“No, I don’t mean that.”

“Yes, you do.”

“How do you know what I mean? Why don’t you practise as a doctor, if you like to work so much?”

Dick had made them both wretched by this time, but simultaneously they had become vague with drink and in a moment they forgot; Collis left, and they shook hands warmly.

“Think it over,” said Dick sagely.

“Think what over?”

“You know.” It had been something about Collis going into his father’s business—good sound advice.

Clay walked off into space. Dick finished his bottle and then danced with the English girl again, conquering his unwilling body with bold revolutions and stern determined marches down the floor. The most remarkable thing suddenly happened. He was dancing with the girl, the music stopped—and she had disappeared.

“Have you seen her?”

“Seen who?”

“The girl I was dancing with. Su’nly disappeared. Must be in the building.”

“No! No! That’s the ladies’ room.”

He stood up by the bar. There were two other men there, but he could think of no way of starting a conversation. He could have told them all about Rome and the violent origins of the Colonna and Gaetani families but he realized that as a beginning that would be somewhat abrupt. A row of Yenci dolls on the cigar counter fell suddenly to the floor; there was a subsequent confusion and he had a sense of having been the cause of it,so he went back to the cabaret and drank a cup of black coffee. Collis was gone and the English girl was gone and there seemed nothing to do but go back to the hotel and lie down with his black heart. He paid his check and got his hat and coat.

There was dirty water in the gutters and between the rough cobblestones; a marshy vapor from the Campagna, a sweat of exhausted cultures tainted the morning air. A quartet of taxi-drivers, their little eyes bobbing in dark pouches, surrounded him. One who leaned insistently in his face he pushed harshly away.

“Quanto a Hotel Quirinal?”

“Cento lire.”

Six dollars. He shook his head and offered thirty lire which was twice the day-time fare, but they shrugged their shoulders as one pair, and moved off.

“Trente-cinque lire e mancie,” he said firmly.

“Cento lire.”

He broke into English.

“To go half a mile? You’ll take me for forty lire.”

“Oh, no.”

He was very tired. He pulled open the door of a cab and got in.

“Hotel Quirinal!” he said to the driver who stood obstinately outside the window. “Wipe that sneer off your face and take me to the Quirinal.”

“Ah, no.”

Dick got out. By the door of the Bonbonieri some one was arguing with the taxi-drivers, some one who now tried to explain their attitude to Dick; again one of the men pressed close, insisting and gesticulating and Dick shoved him away.

“I want to go to the Quirinal Hotel.”

“He says wan huner lire,” explained the interpreter.

“I understand. I’ll give him fif’y lire. Go on away.” This last to the insistent man who had edged up once more. The man looked at him and spat contemptuously.

The passionate impatience of the week leaped up in Dick and clothed itself like a flash in violence, the honorable, the traditional resource of his land; he stepped forward and slapped the man’s face.

They surged about him, threatening, waving their arms, trying ineffectually to close in on him—with his back against the wall Dick hit out clumsily, laughing a little and for a few minutes the mock fight, an affair of foiled rushes and padded, glancing blows, swayed back and forth in front of the door. Then Dick tripped and fell; he was hurt somewhere but he struggled up again wrestling in arms that suddenly broke apart. There was a new voice and a new argument but he leaned against the wall, panting and furious at the indignity of his position. He saw there was no sympathy for him but he was unable to believe that he was wrong.

They were going to the police station and settle it there. His hat was retrieved and handed to him, and with some one holding his arm lightly he strode around the corner with the taxi-men and entered a bare barrack where carabinieri lounged under a single dim light.

At a desk sat a captain, to whom the officious individual who had stopped the battle spoke at length in Italian, at times pointing at Dick, and letting himself be interrupted by the taxi-men who delivered short bursts of invective and denunciation. The captain began to nod impatiently. He held up his hand and the hydra-headed address, with a few parting exclamations, died away. Then he turned to Dick.

“Spick Italiano?” he asked.

“No.”

“Spick Français?”

“Oui,” said Dick, glowering.

“Alors. Écoute. Va au Quirinal. Espèce d’endormi. Écoute: vous êtes soûl. Payez ce que le chauffeur demande. Comprenez-vous?”

Diver shook his head.

“Non, je ne veux pas.”

“Come?”

“Je paierai quarante lires. C’est bien assez.”

The captain stood up.

“Écoute!” he cried portentously. “Vous êtes soûl. Vous avez battu le chauffeur. Comme ci, comme ça.” He struck the air excitedly with right hand and left, “C’est bon que je vous donne la liberté. Payez ce qu’il a dit—cento lire. Va au Quirinal.”

Raging with humiliation, Dick stared back at him.

“All right.” He turned blindly to the door—before him, leering and nodding, was the man who had brought him to the police station. “I’ll go home,” he shouted, “but first I’ll fix this baby.”

He walked past the staring carabinieri and up to the grinning face, hit it with a smashing left beside the jaw. The man dropped to the floor.

For a moment he stood over him in savage triumph—but even as a first pang of doubt shot through him the world reeled; he was clubbed down, and fists and boots beat on him in a savage tattoo. He felt his nose break like a shingle and his eyes jerk as if they had snapped back on a rubber band into his head. A rib splintered under a stamping heel. Momentarily he lost consciousness, regained it as he was raised to a sitting position and his wrists jerked together with handcuffs. He struggled automatically. The plainclothes lieutenant whom he had knocked down stood dabbing his jaw with a handkerchief and looking into it for blood; he came over to Dick, poised himself, drew back his arm and smashed him to the floor.

When Doctor Diver lay quite still a pail of water was sloshed over him. One of his eyes opened dimly as he was being dragged along by the wrists through a bloody haze, and he made out the human and ghastly face of one of the taxi-drivers.

“Go to the Excelsior hotel,” he cried faintly. “Tell Miss Warren. Two hundred lire! Miss Warren. Due centi lire! Oh, you dirty—you God—”

Still he was dragged along through the bloody haze, choking and sobbing, over vague irregular surfaces into some small place where he was dropped upon a stone floor. The men went out, a door clanged, he was alone.





23


Until one o’clock Baby Warren lay in bed, reading one of Marion Crawford’s curiously inanimate Roman stories; then she went to a window and looked down into the street. Across from the hotel two carabinieri, grotesque in swaddling capes and harlequin hats, swung voluminously from this side and that, like mains’ls coming about, and watching them she thought of the guards’ officer who had stared at her so intensely at lunch. He had possessed the arrogance of a tall member of a short race, with no obligation save to be tall. Had he come up to her and said:“Let’s go along, you and I,” she would have answered:“Why not?”—at least it seemed so now, for she was still disembodied by an unfamiliar background.

Her thoughts drifted back slowly through the guardsman to the two carabinieri, to Dick—she got into bed and turned out the light.

A little before four she was awakened by a brusque knocking.

“Yes—what is it?”

“It’s the concierge, Madame.”

She pulled on her kimono and faced him sleepily.

“Your friend name Deever he’s in trouble. He had trouble with the police, and they have him in the jail. He sent a taxi up to tell, the driver says that he promised him two hundred lire.” He paused cautiously for this to be approved. “The driver says Mr. Deever in the bad trouble. He had a fight with the police and is terribly bad hurt.”

“I’ll be right down.”

She dressed to an accompaniment of anxious heartbeats and ten minutes later stepped out of the elevator into the dark lobby. The chauffeur who brought the message was gone; the concierge hailed another one and told him the location of the jail. As they rode, the darkness lifted and thinned outside and Baby’s nerves, scarcely awake, cringed faintly at the unstable balance between night and day. She began to race against the day; sometimes on the broad avenues she gained but whenever the thing that was pushing up paused for a moment, gusts of wind blew here and there impatiently and the slow creep of light began once more. The cab went past a loud fountain splashing in a voluminous shadow, turned into an alley so curved that the buildings were warped and strained following it, bumped and rattled over cobblestones, and stopped with a jerk where two sentry boxes were bright against a wall of green damp. Suddenly from the violet darkness of an archway came Dick’s voice, shouting and screaming.

“Are there any English? Are there any Americans? Are there any English? Are there any—oh, my God! You dirty Wops!”

His voice died away and she heard a dull sound of beating on the door. Then the voice began again.

“Are there any Americans? Are there any English?”

Following the voice she ran through the arch into acourt, whirled about in momentary confusion and located the small guard-room whence the cries came. Two carabinieri started to their feet, but Baby brushed past them to the door of the cell.

“Dick!” she called. “What’s the trouble?”

“They’ve put out my eye,” he cried. “They handcuffed me and then they beat me, the goddamn—the—”

Flashing around Baby took a step toward the two carabinieri.

“What have you done to him?” she whispered so fiercely that they flinched before her gathering fury.

“Non capisco inglese.”

In French she execrated them; her wild, confident rage filled the room, enveloped them until they shrank and wriggled from the garments of blame with which she invested them. “Do something! Do something!”

“We can do nothing until we are ordered.”

“Bene. Bay-nay! Bene!”

Once more Baby let her passion scorch around them until they sweated out apologies for their impotence, looking at each other with the sense that something had after all gone terribly wrong. Baby went to the cell door, leaned against it, almost caressing it, as if that could make Dick feel her presence and power, and cried:“I’m going to the Embassy, I’ll be back.” Throwing a last glance of infinite menace at the carabinieri she ran out.

She drove to the American Embassy where she paid off the taxi-driver upon his insistence. It was still dark when she ran up the steps and pressed the bell. She had pressed it three times before a sleepy English porter opened the door to her.

“I want to see some one,” she said. “Any one—but right away.”

“No one’s awake, Madame. We don’t open until nine o’clock.”

Impatiently she waved the hour away.

“This is important. A man—an American has been terribly beaten. He’s in an Italian jail.”

“No one’s awake now. At nine o’clock—”

“I can’t wait. They’ve put out a man’s eye—my brother-in-law, and they won’t let him out of jail. I must talk to some one—can’t you see? Are you crazy? Are you an idiot, you stand there with that look in your face?”

“Hime unable to do anything, Madame.”

“You’ve got to wake some one up!” She seized him by the shoulders and jerked him violently. “It’s a matter of life and death. If you won’t wake some one a terrible thing will happen to you—”

“Kindly don’t lay hands on me, Madame.”

From above and behind the porter floated down a weary Groton voice.

“What is it there?”

The porter answered with relief.

“It’s a lady, sir, and she has shook me.” He had stepped back to speak and Baby pushed forward into the hall. On an upper landing, just aroused from sleep and wrapped in a white embroidered Persian robe, stood a singular young man. His face was of a monstrous and unnatural pink, vivid yet dead, and over his mouth was fastened what appeared to be a gag. When he saw Baby he moved his head back into a shadow.

“What is it?” he repeated.

Baby told him, in her agitation edging forward to the stairs. In the course of her story she realized that the gag was in reality a mustache bandage and that the man’s face was covered with pink cold cream, but the fact fitted quietly into the nightmare. The thing to do, she cried passionately, was for him to come to the jail with her at once and get Dick out.

“It’s a bad business,” he said.

“Yes,” she agreed conciliatingly. “Yes?”

“This trying to fight the police.” A note of personal affront crept into his voice, “I’m afraid there’s nothing to be done until nine o’clock.”

“Till nine o’clock,” she repeated aghast. “But you can do something, certainly! You can come to the jail with me and see that they don’t hurt him any more.”

“We aren’t permitted to do anything like that. The Consulate handles these things. The Consulate will be open at nine.”

His face, constrained to impassivity by the binding strap, infuriated Baby.

“I can’t wait until nine. My brother-in-law says they’ve put his eye out—he’s seriously hurt! I have to get to him. I have to find a doctor.” She let herself go and began to cry angrily as she talked, for she knew that he would respond to her agitation rather than her words. “You’ve got to do something about this. It’s your business to protect American citizens in trouble.”

But he was of the Eastern seaboard and too hard for her. Shaking his head patiently at her failure to understand his position he drew the Persian robe closer about him and came down a few steps.

“Write down the address of the Consulate for this lady,” he said to the porter, “and look up Doctor Colazzo’s address and telephone number and write that down too.” He turned to Baby, with the expression of an exasperated Christ. “My dear lady, the diplomatic corps represents the Government of the United States to the Government of Italy. It has nothing to do with the protection of citizens, except under specific instructions from the State Department. Your brother-in-law has broken the laws of this country and been put in jail, just as an Italian might be put in jail in New York. The only people who can let him go are the Italian courts and if your brother-in-law has a case you can get aid and advice from the Consulate, which protects the rights of American citizens. The Consulate does not open until nine o’clock. Even if it were my brother I couldn’t do anything—”

“Can you phone the Consulate?” she broke in.

“We can’t interfere with the Consulate. When the Consul gets there at nine—”

“Can you give me his home address?”

After a fractional pause the man shook his head. He took the memorandum from the porter and gave it to her.

“Now I’ll ask you to excuse me.”

He had manoeuvred her to the door: for an instant the violet dawn fell shrilly upon his pink mask and upon the linen sack that supported his mustache; then Baby was standing on the front steps alone. She had been in the embassy ten minutes.

The piazza whereon it faced was empty save for an old man gathering cigarette butts with a spiked stick. Baby caught a taxi presently and went to the Consulate but there was no one there save a trio of wretched women scrubbing the stairs. She could not make them understand that she wanted the Consul’s home address—in a sudden resurgence of anxiety she rushed out and told the chauffeur to take her to the jail. He did not know where it was, but by the use of the words semper dritte, dextra and sinestra she manoeuvred him to its approximate locality, where she dismounted and explored a labyrinth of familiar alleys. But the buildings and the alleys all looked alike. Emerging from one trail into the Piazza di Spagna she saw the American Express Company and her heart lifted at the word“American” on the sign. There was a light in the window and hurrying across the square she tried the door, but it was locked, and inside the clock stood at seven. Then she thought of Collis Clay.

She remembered the name of his hotel, a stuffy villa sealed in red plush across from the Excelsior. The woman on duty at the office was not disposed to help her—she had no authority to disturb Mr. Clay, and refused to let Miss Warren go up to his room alone; convinced finally that this was not an affair of passion she accompanied her.

Collis lay naked upon his bed. He had come in tight and, awakening, it took him some moments to realize his nudity. He atoned for it by an excess of modesty. Taking his clothes into the bathroom he dressed in haste, muttering to himself “Gosh. She certainly musta got a good look at me.” After some telephoning, he and Baby found the jail and went to it.

The cell door was open and Dick was slumped on a chair in the guard-room. The carabinieri had washed some of the blood from his face, brushed him and set his hat concealingly upon his head. Baby stood in the doorway trembling.

“Mr. Clay will stay with you,” she said. “I want to get the Consul and a doctor.”

“All right.”

“Just stay quiet.”

“All right.”

“I’ll be back.”

She drove to the Consulate; it was after eight now, and she was permitted to sit in the ante-room. Toward nine the Consul came in and Baby, hysterical with impotence and exhaustion, repeated her story. The Consul was disturbed. He warned her against getting into brawls in strange cities, but he was chiefly concerned that she should wait outside—with despair she read in his elderly eye that he wanted to be mixed up as little as possible in this catastrophe. Waiting on his action, she passed the minutes by phoning a doctor to go to Dick. There were other people in the ante-room and several were admitted to the Consul’s office. After half an hour she chose the moment of some one’s coming out and pushed past the secretary into the room.

“This is outrageous! An American has been beaten half to death and thrown into prison and you make no move to help.”

“Just a minute, Mrs.—”

“I’ve waited long enough. You come right down to the jail and get him out!”

“Mrs.—”

“We’re people of considerable standing in America—” Her mouth hardened as she continued. “If it wasn’t for the scandal we can—I shall see that your indifference to this matter is reported in the proper quarter. If my brother-in-law were a British citizen he’d have been free hours ago, but you’re more concerned with what the police will think than about what you’re here for.”

“Mrs.—”

“You put on your hat and come with me right away.”

The mention of his hat alarmed the Consul who began to clean his spectacles hurriedly and to ruffle his papers. This proved of no avail: the American Woman, aroused, stood over him; the clean-sweeping irrational temper that had broken the moral back of a race and made a nursery out of a continent, was too much for him. He rang for the Vice-consul—Baby had won.

Dick sat in the sunshine that fell profusely through the guard-room window. Collis was with him and two carabinieri, and they were waiting for something to happen. With the narrowed vision of his one eye Dick could see the carabinieri; they were Tuscan peasants with short upper lips and he found it difficult to associate them with the brutality of last night. He sent one of them to fetch him a glass of beer.

The beer made him light-headed and the episode was momentarily illumined by a ray of sardonic humor. Collis was under the impression that the English girl had something to do with the catastrophe, but Dick was sure she had disappeared long before it happened. Collis was still absorbed by the fact that Miss Warren had found him naked on his bed.

Dick’s rage had retreated into him a little and he felt a vast criminal irresponsibility. What had happened to him was so awful that nothing could make any difference unless he could choke it to death, and, as this was unlikely, he was hopeless. He would be a different person henceforward, and in his raw state he had bizarre feelings of what the new self would be. The matter had about it the impersonal quality of an act of God. No mature Aryan is able to profit by a humiliation; when he forgives it has become part of his life, he has identified himself with the thing which has humiliated him—an upshot that in this case was impossible.

When Collis spoke of retribution, Dick shook his head and was silent. A lieutenant of carabinieri, pressed, burnished, vital, came into the room like three men and the guards jumped to attention. He seized the empty beer bottle and directed a stream of scolding at his men. The new spirit was in him, and the first thing was to get the beer bottle out of the guard-room. Dick looked at Collis and laughed.

The Vice-consul, an over-worked young man named Swanson, arrived, and they started to the court; Collis and Swanson on either side of Dick and the two carabinieri close behind. It was a yellow, hazy morning; the squares and arcades were crowded and Dick, pulling his hat low over his head, walked fast, setting the pace, until one of the short-legged carabinieri ran alongside and protested. Swanson arranged matters.

“I’ve disgraced you, haven’t I?” said Dick jovially.

“You’re liable to get killed fighting Italians,” replied Swanson sheepishly. “They’ll probably let you go this time but if you were an Italian you’d get a couple of months in prison. And how!”

“Have you ever been in prison?”

Swanson laughed.

“I like him,” announced Dick to Clay. “He’s a very likeable young man and he gives people excellent advice, but I’ll bet he’s been to jail himself. Probably spent weeks at a time in jail.”

Swanson laughed.

“I mean you want to be careful. You don’t know how these people are.”

“Oh, I know how they are,” broke out Dick, irritably. “They’re god damn stinkers.” He turned around to the carabinieri:“Did you get that?”

“I’m leaving you here,” Swanson said quickly. “I told your sister-in-law I would—our lawyer will meet you upstairs in the court-room. You want to be careful.”

“Good-by.” Dick shook hands politely. “Thank you very much. I feel you have a future—”

With another smile Swanson hurried away, resuming his official expression of disapproval.

Now they came into a courtyard on all four sides of which outer stairways mounted to the chambers above. As they crossed the flags a groaning, hissing, booing sound went up from the loiterers in the courtyard, voices full of fury and scorn. Dick stared about.

“What’s that?” he demanded, aghast.

One of the carabinieri spoke to a group of men and the sound died away.

They came into the court-room. A shabby Italian lawyer from the Consulate spoke at length to the judge while Dick and Collis waited aside. Some one who knew English turned from the window that gave on the yard and explained the sound that had accompanied their passage through.A native of Frascati had raped and slain a five-year-old child and was to be brought in that morning—the crowd had assumed it was Dick.

In a few minutes the lawyer told Dick that he was freed—the court considered him punished enough.

“Enough!” Dick cried. “Punished for what?”

“Come along,” said Collis. “You can’t do anything now.”

“But what did I do, except get into a fight with some taxi men?”

“They claim you went up to a detective as if you were going to shake hands with him and hit him—”

“That’s not true! I told him I was going to hit him—I didn’t know he was a detective.”

“You better go along,” urged the lawyer.

“Come along.” Collis took his arm and they descended the steps.

“I want to make a speech,” Dick cried. “I want to explain to these people how I raped a five-year-old girl. Maybe I did—”

“Come along.”

Baby was waiting with a doctor in a taxi-cab. Dick did not want to look at her and he disliked the doctor, whose stern manner revealed him as one of that least palpable of European types, the Latin moralist. Dick summed up his conception of the disaster, but no one had much to say. In his room in the Quirinal the doctor washed off the rest of the blood and the oily sweat, set his nose, his fractured ribs and fingers, disinfected the smaller wounds and put a hopeful dressing on the eye. Dick asked for a quarter of a grain of morphine, for he was still wide awake and full of nervous energy. With the morphine he fell asleep; the doctor and Collis left and Baby waited with him until a woman could arrive from the English nursing home. It had been a hard night but she had the satisfaction of feeling that, whatever Dick’s previous record was, they now possessed a moral superiority over him for as long as he proved of any use.

BOOK III


1


Frau Kaethe Gregorovious overtook her husband on the path of their villa.

“How was Nicole?” she asked mildly; but she spoke out of breath, giving away the fact that she had held the question in her mind during her run.

Franz looked at her in surprise.

“Nicole’s not sick. What makes you ask, dearest one?”

“You see her so much—I thought she must be sick.”

“We will talk of this in the house.”

Kaethe agreed meekly. His study was over in the administration building and the children were with their tutor in the living-room; they went up to the bedroom.

“Excuse me, Franz,” said Kaethe before he could speak. “Excuse me, dear, I had no right to say that. I know my obligations and I am proud of them. But there is a bad feeling between Nicole and me.”

“Birds in their little nests agree,” Franz thundered. Finding the tone inappropriate to the sentiment he repeated his command in the spaced and considered rhythm with which his old master, Doctor Dohmler, could cast significance on the tritest platitude. “Birds—in—their—nests—agree!”

“I realize that. You haven’t seen me fail in courtesy toward Nicole.”

“I see you failing in common sense. Nicole is half a patient—she will possibly remain something of a patient all her life. In the absence of Dick I am responsible.” He hesitated; sometimes as a quiet joke he tried to keep news from Kaethe. “There was a cable from Rome this morning. Dick has had grippe and is starting home to-morrow.”

Relieved, Kaethe pursued her course in a less personal tone:

“I think Nicole is less sick than any one thinks—she only cherishes her illness as an instrument of power. She ought to be in the cinema, like your Norma Talmadge—that’s where all American women would be happy.”

“Are you jealous of Norma Talmadge, on a film?”

“I don’t like Americans. They’re selfish, selfish!”

“You like Dick?”

“I like him,” she admitted. “He’s different, he thinks of others.”

—And so does Norma Talmadge, Franz said to himself. Norma Talmadge must be a fine, noble woman beyond her loveliness. They must compel her to play foolish rôles; Norma Talmadge must be a woman whom it would be a great privilege to know.

Kaethe had forgotten about Norma Talmadge, a vivid shadow that she had fretted bitterly upon one night as they were driving home from the movies in Zurich.

“—Dick married Nicole for her money,” she said. “That was his weakness—you hinted as much yourself one night.”

“You’re being malicious.”

“I shouldn’t have said that,” she retracted. “We must all live together like birds, as you say. But it’s difficult when Nicole acts as—when Nicole pulls herself back a little, as if she were holding her breath—as if I smelt bad!”

Kaethe had touched a material truth. She did most of her work herself, and, frugal, she bought few clothes. An American shop-girl, laundering two changes of underwear every night, would have noticed a hint of yesterday’s reawakened sweat about Kaethe’s person, less a smell than an ammoniacal reminder of the eternity of toil and decay. To Franz this was as natural as the thick dark scent of Kaethe’s hair, and he would have missed it equally; but to Nicole, born hating the smell of a nurse’s fingers dressing her, it was an offense only to be endured.

“And the children,” Kaethe continued. “She doesn’t like them to play with our children—” but Franz had heard enough:

“Hold your tongue—that kind of talk can hurt me professionally, since we owe this clinic to Nicole’s money. Let us have lunch.”

Kaethe realized that her outburst had been ill-advised, but Franz’s last remark reminded her that other Americans had money, and a week later she put her dislike of Nicole into new words.

The occasion was the dinner they tendered the Divers upon Dick’s return. Hardly had their footfalls ceased on the path when she shut the door and said to Franz:

“Did you see around his eyes? He’s been on a debauch!”

“Go gently,” Franz requested. “Dick told me about that as soon as he came home. He was boxing on the trans-Atlantic ship. The American passengers box a lot on these trans-Atlantic ships.”

“I believe that?” she scoffed. “It hurts him to move one of his arms and he has an unhealed scar on his temple—you can see where the hair’s been cut away.”

Franz had not noticed these details.

“But what?” Kaethe demanded. “Do you think that sort of thing does the Clinic any good? The liquor I smelt on him tonight, and several other times since he’s been back.”

She slowed her voice to fit the gravity of what she was about to say:“Dick is no longer a serious man.”

Franz rocked his shoulders up the stairs, shaking off her persistence. In their bedroom he turned on her.

“He is most certainly a serious man and a brilliant man. Of all the men who have recently taken their degrees in neuro-pathology in Zurich, Dick has been regarded as the most brilliant—more brilliant than I could ever be.”

“For shame!”

“It’s the truth—the shame would be not to admit it. I turn to Dick when cases are highly involved. His publications are still standard in their line—go into any medical library and ask. Most students think he’s an Englishman—they don’t believe that such thoroughness could come out of America.” He groaned domestically, taking his pajamas from under the pillow, “I can’t understand why you talk this way, Kaethe—I thought you liked him.”

“For shame!” Kaethe said. “You’re the solid one, you do the work.It’s a case of hare and tortoise—and in my opinion the hare’s race is almost done.”

“Tch! Tch!”

“Very well, then. It’s true.”

With his open hand he pushed down air briskly.

“Stop!”

The upshot was that they had exchanged viewpoints like debaters. Kaethe admitted to herself that she had been too hard on Dick, whom she admired and of whom she stood in awe, who had been so appreciative and understanding of herself. As for Franz, once Kaethe’s idea had had time to sink in, he never after believed that Dick was a serious person. And as time went on he convinced himself that he had never thought so.

Dick told Nicole an expurgated version of the catastrophe in Rome—in his version he had gone philanthropically to the rescue of a drunken friend. He could trust Baby Warren to hold her tongue, since he had painted the disastrous effect of the truth upon Nicole. All this, however, was a low hurdle compared to the lingering effect of the episode upon him.

In reaction he took himself for an intensified beating in his work, so that Franz, trying to break with him, could find no basis on which to begin a disagreement. No friendship worth the name was ever destroyed in an hour without some painful flesh being torn—so Franz let himself believe with ever-increasing conviction that Dick travelled intellectually and emotionally at such a rate of speed that the vibrations jarred him—this was a contrast that had previously been considered a virtue in their relation. So, for the shoddiness of needs, are shoes made out of last year’s hide.

Yet it was May before Franz found an opportunity to insert the first wedge. Dick came into his office white and tired one noon and sat down, saying:

“Well, she’s gone.”

“She’s dead?”

“The heart quit.”

Dick sat exhausted in the chair nearest the door. During three nights he had remained with the scabbed anonymous woman-artist he had come to love, formally to portion out the adrenalin, but really to throw as much wan light as he could into the darkness ahead.

Half appreciating his feeling, Franz travelled quickly over an opinion:

“It was neuro-syphilis. All the Wassermanns we took won’t tell me differently. The spinal fluid—”

“Never mind,” said Dick. “Oh, God, never mind! If she cared enough about her secret to take it away with her, let it go at that.”

“You better lay off for a day.”

“Don’t worry, I’m going to.”

Franz had his wedge; looking up from the telegram that he was writing to the woman’s brother he inquired:“Or do you want to take a little trip?”

“Not now.”

“I don’t mean a vacation. There’s a case in Lausanne. I’ve been on the phone with a Chilian all morning—”

“She was so damn brave,” said Dick. “And it took her so long.” Franz shook his head sympathetically and Dick got himself together.“Excuse me for interrupting you.”

“This is just a change—the situation is a father’s problem with his son—the father can’t get the son up here. He wants somebody to come down there.”

“What is it? Alcoholism? Homosexuality? When you say Lausanne—”

“A little of everything.”

“I’ll go down. Is there any money in it?”

“Quite a lot, I’d say. Count on staying two or three days, and get the boy up here if he needs to be watched. In any case take your time, take your ease; combine business with pleasure.”

After two hours’ train sleep Dick felt renewed, and he approached the interview with Señor Pardo y Cuidad Real in good spirits.

These interviews were much of a type. Often the sheer hysteria of the family representative was as interesting psychologically as the condition of the patient. This one was no exception: Señor Pardo y Cuidad Real, a handsome iron-gray Spaniard, noble of carriage, with all the appurtenances of wealth and power, raged up and down his suite in the Hôtel des Trois Mondes and told the story of his son with no more self-control than a drunken woman.

“I am at the end of my invention. My son is corrupt. He was corrupt at Harrow, he was corrupt at King’s College, Cambridge. He’s incorrigibly corrupt. Now that there is this drinking it is more and more obvious how he is, and there is continual scandal. I have tried everything—I worked out a plan with a doctor friend of mine, sent them together for a tour of Spain. Every evening Francisco had an injection of cantharides and then the two went together to a reputable bordello—for a week or so it seemed to work but the result was nothing. Finally last week in this very room, rather in that bathroom—” he pointed at it, “—I made Francisco strip to the waist and lashed him with a whip—”

Exhausted with his emotion he sat down and Dick spoke:

“That was foolish—the trip to Spain was futile also—” He struggled against an upsurging hilarity—that any reputable medical man should have lent himself to such an amateurish experiment! “—Señor, I must tell you that in these cases we can promise nothing. In the case of the drinking we can often accomplish something—with proper co-operation. The first thing is to see the boy and get enough of his confidence to find whether he has any insight into the matter.”

—The boy, with whom he sat on the terrace, was about twenty, handsome and alert.

“I’d like to know your attitude,” Dick said. “Do you feel that the situation is getting worse? And do you want to do anything about it?”

“I suppose I do,” said Francisco, “I am very unhappy.”

“Do you think it’s from the drinking or from the abnormality?”

“I think the drinking is caused by the other.” He was serious for a while—suddenly an irrepressible facetiousness broke through and he laughed, saying, “It’s hopeless. At King’s I was known as the Queen of Chile. That trip to Spain—all it did was to make me nauseated by the sight of a woman.”

Dick caught him up sharply.

“If you’re happy in this mess, then I can’t help you and I’m wasting my time.”

“No, let’s talk—I despise most of the others so.” There was some manliness in the boy, perverted now into an active resistance to his father. But he had that typically roguish look in his eyes that homosexuals assume in discussing the subject.

“It’s a hole-and-corner business at best,” Dick told him. “You’ll spend your life on it, and its consequences, and you won’t have time or energy for any other decent or social act. If you want to face the world you’ll have to begin by controlling your sensuality—and, first of all, the drinking that provokes it—”

He talked automatically, having abandoned the case ten minutes before. They talked pleasantly through another hour about the boy’s home in Chile and about his ambitions. It was as close as Dick had ever come to comprehending such a character from any but the pathological angle—he gathered that this very charm made it possible for Francisco to perpetrate his outrages, and, for Dick, charm always had an independent existence, whether it was the mad gallantry of the wretch who had died in the clinic this morning, or the courageous grace which this lost young man brought to a drab old story. Dick tried to dissect it into pieces small enough to store away—realizing that the totality of a life may be different in quality from its segments, and also that life during the forties seemed capable of being observed only in segments. His love for Nicole and Rosemary, his friendship with Abe North, with Tommy Barban in the broken universe of the war’s ending—in such contacts the personalities had seemed to press up so close to him that he became the personality itself—there seemed some necessity of taking all or nothing; it was as if for the remainder of his life he was condemned to carry with him the egos of certain people, early met and early loved, and to be only as complete as they were complete themselves. There was some element of loneliness involved—so easy to be loved—so hard to love.

As he sat on the veranda with young Francisco, a ghost of the past swam into his ken. A tall, singularly swaying male detached himself from the shrubbery and approached Dick and Francisco with feeble resolution. For a moment he formed such an apologetic part of the vibrant landscape that Dick scarcely remarked him—then Dick was on his feet, shaking hands with an abstracted air, thinking, “My God, I’ve stirred up a nest!” and trying to collect the man’s name.

“This is Doctor Diver, isn’t it?”

“Well, well—Mr. Dumphry, isn’t it?”

“Royal Dumphry. I had the pleasure of having dinner one night in that lovely garden of yours.”

“Of course.” Trying to dampen Mr. Dumphry’s enthusiasm, Dick went into impersonal chronology. “It was in nineteen—twenty-four—or twenty-five—”

He had remained standing, but Royal Dumphry, shy as he had seemed at first, was no laggard with his pick and spade; he spoke to Francisco in a flip, intimate manner, but the latter, ashamed of him, joined Dick in trying to freeze him away.

“Doctor Diver—one thing I want to say before you go. I’ve never forgotten that evening in your garden—how nice you and your wife were. To me it’s one of the finest memories in my life, one of the happiest ones. I’ve always thought of it as the most civilized gathering of people that I have ever known.”

Dick continued a crab-like retreat toward the nearest door of the hotel.

“I’m glad you remembered it so pleasantly. Now I’ve got to see—”

“I understand,” Royal Dumphry pursued sympathetically. “I hear he’s dying.”

“Who’s dying?”

“Perhaps I shouldn’t have said that—but we have the same physician.”

Dick paused, regarding him in astonishment. “Who’re you talking about?”

“Why, your wife’s father—perhaps I—”

“My what?”

“I suppose—you mean I’m the first person—”

“You mean my wife’s father is here, in Lausanne?”

“Why, I thought you knew—I thought that was why you were here.”

“What doctor is taking care of him?”

Dick scrawled the name in a notebook, excused himself, and hurried to a telephone booth.

It was convenient for Doctor Dangeu to see Doctor Diver at his house immediately.

Doctor Dangeu was a young Genevois; for a moment he was afraid that he was going to lose a profitable patient, but, when Dick reassured him, he divulged the fact that Mr. Warren was indeed dying.

“He is only fifty but the liver has stopped restoring itself; the precipitating factor is alcoholism.”

“Doesn’t respond?”

“The man can take nothing except liquids—I give him three days, or at most, a week.”

“Does his elder daughter, Miss Warren, know his condition?”

“By his own wish no one knows except the man-servant. It was only this morning I felt I had to tell him—he took it excitedly, although he has been in a very religious and resigned mood from the beginning of his illness.”

Dick considered:“Well—” he decided slowly, “in any case I’ll take care of the family angle. But I imagine they would want a consultation.”

“As you like.”

“I know I speak for them when I ask you to call in one of the best-known medicine men around the lake—Herbrugge, from Geneva.”

“I was thinking of Herbrugge.”

“Meanwhile I’m here for a day at least and I’ll keep in touch with you.”

That evening Dick went to Señor Pardo y Cuidad Real and they talked.

“We have large estates in Chile—” said the old man. “My son could well be taking care of them. Or I can get him in any one of a dozen enterprises in Paris—” He shook his head and paced across the windows against a spring rain so cheerful that it didn’t even drive the swans to cover, “My only son! Can’t you take him with you?”

The Spaniard knelt suddenly at Dick’s feet.

“Can’t you cure my only son? I believe in you—you can take him with you, cure him.”

“It’s impossible to commit a person on such grounds. I wouldn’t if I could.”

The Spaniard got up from his knees.

“I have been hasty—I have been driven—”

Descending to the lobby Dick met Doctor Dangeu in the elevator.

“I was about to call your room,” the latter said. “Can we speak out on the terrace?”

“Is Mr. Warren dead?” Dick demanded.

“He is the same—the consultation is in the morning. Meanwhile he wants to see his daughter—your wife—with the greatest fervor. It seems there was some quarrel—”

“I know all about that.”

The doctors looked at each other, thinking.

“Why don’t you talk to him before you make up your mind?” Dangeu suggested. “His death will be graceful—merely a weakening and sinking.”

With an effort Dick consented.

“All right.”

The suite in which Devereux Warren was gracefully weakening and sinking was of the same size as that of the Señor Pardo y Cuidad Real—throughout this hotel there were many chambers wherein rich ruins, fugitives from justice, claimants to the thrones of mediatized principalities, lived on the derivatives of opium or barbitol listening eternally as to an inescapable radio, to the coarse melodies of old sins. This corner of Europe does not so much draw people as accept them without inconvenient questions. Routes cross here—people bound for private sanitariums or tuberculosis resorts in the mountains, people who are no longer persona grata in France or Italy.

The suite was darkened. A nun with a holy face was nursing the man whose emaciated fingers stirred a rosary on the white sheet. He was still handsome and his voice summoned up a thick burr of individuality as he spoke to Dick, after Dangeu had left them together.

“We get a lot of understanding at the end of life. Only now, Doctor Diver, do I realize what it was all about.”

Dick waited.

“I’ve been a bad man. You must know how little right I have to see Nicole again, yet a Bigger Man than either of us says to forgive and to pity.” The rosary slipped from his weak hands and slid off the smooth bed covers. Dick picked it up for him. “If I could see Nicole for ten minutes I would go happy out of the world.”

“It’s not a decision I can make for myself,” said Dick. “Nicole is not strong.” He made his decision but pretended to hesitate. “I can put it up to my professional associate.”

“What your associate says goes with me—very well, Doctor. Let me tell you my debt to you is so large—”

Dick stood up quickly.

“I’ll let you know the result through Doctor Dangeu.”

In his room he called the clinic on the Zugersee. After a long time Kaethe answered from her own house.

“I want to get in touch with Franz.”

“Franz is up on the mountain. I’m going up myself—is it something I can tell him, Dick?”

“It’s about Nicole—her father is dying here in Lausanne. Tell Franz that, to show him it’s important; and ask him to phone me from up there.”

“I will.”

“Tell him I’ll be in my room here at the hotel from three to five, and again from seven to eight, and after that to page me in the dining-room.”

In plotting these hours he forgot to add that Nicole was not to be told; when he remembered it he was talking into a dead telephone. Certainly Kaethe should realize.

…Kaethe had no exact intention of telling Nicole about the call when she rode up the deserted hill of mountain wild flowers and secret winds, where the patients were taken to ski in winter and to climb in spring.Getting off the train she saw Nicole shepherding the children through some organized romp. Approaching, she drew her arm gently along Nicole’s shoulder, saying:“You are clever with children—you must teach them more about swimming in the summer.”

In the play they had grown hot, and Nicole’s reflex in drawing away from Kaethe’s arm was automatic to the point of rudeness. Kaethe’s hand fell awkwardly into space, and then she too reacted, verbally, and deplorably.

“Did you think I was going to embrace you?” she demanded sharply.“It was only about Dick, I talked on the phone to him and I was sorry—”

“Is anything the matter with Dick?”

Kaethe suddenly realized her error, but she had taken a tactless course and there was no choice but to answer as Nicole pursued her with reiterated questions:“…then why were you sorry?”

“Nothing about Dick. I must talk to Franz.”

“It is about Dick.”

There was terror in her face and collaborating alarm in the faces of the Diver children, near at hand. Kaethe collapsed with:“Your father is ill in Lausanne—Dick wants to talk to Franz about it.”

“Is he very sick?” Nicole demanded—just as Franz came up with his hearty hospital manner. Gratefully Kaethe passed the remnant of the buck to him—but the damage was done.

“I’m going to Lausanne,” announced Nicole.

“One minute,” said Franz. “I’m not sure it’s advisable. I must first talk on the phone to Dick.”

“Then I’ll miss the train down,” Nicole protested, “and then I’ll miss the three o’clock from Zurich! If my father is dying I must—” She left this in the air, afraid to formulate it. “I must go. I’ll have to run for the train.” She was running even as she spoke toward the sequence of flat cars that crowned the bare hill with bursting steam and sound. Over her shoulder she called back, “If you phone Dick tell him I’m coming, Franz!”…

…Dick was in his own room in the hotel reading The New York Herald when the swallow-like nun rushed in—simultaneously the phone rang.

“Is he dead?” Dick demanded of the nun, hopefully.

“Monsieur, il est parti—he has gone away.”

“Comment?”

“Il est parti—his man and his baggage have gone away too!”

It was incredible. A man in that condition to arise and depart.

Dick answered the phone-call from Franz. “You shouldn’t have told Nicole,” he protested.

“Kaethe told her, very unwisely.”

“I suppose it was my fault. Never tell a thing to a woman till it’s done. However, I’ll meet Nicole… say, Franz, the craziest thing has happened down here—the old boy took up his bed and walked….”

“At what? What did you say?”

“I say he walked, old Warren—he walked!”

“But why not?”

“He was supposed to be dying of general collapse… he got up and walked away, back to Chicago, I guess…. I don’t know, the nurse is here now…. I don’t know, Franz—I’ve just heard about it…. Call me later.”

He spent the better part of two hours tracing Warren’s movements. The patient had found an opportunity between the change of day and night nurses to resort to the bar where he had gulped down four whiskeys; he paid his hotel bill with a thousand dollar note, instructing the desk that the change should be sent after him, and departed, presumably for America. A last-minute dash by Dick and Dangeu to overtake him at the station resulted only in Dick’s failing to meet Nicole; when they did meet in the lobby of the hotel she seemed suddenly tired, and there was a tight purse to her lips that disquieted him.

“How’s father?” she demanded.

“He’s much better. He seemed to have a good deal of reserve energy after all.” He hesitated, breaking it to her easy. “In fact he got up and went away.”

Wanting a drink, for the chase had occupied the dinner hour, he led her, puzzled, toward the grill, and continued as they occupied two leather easy-chairs and ordered a highball and a glass of beer:“The man who was taking care of him made a wrong prognosis or something—wait a minute,I’ve hardly had time to think the thing out myself.”

“He’s gone?”

“He got the evening train for Paris.”

They sat silent. From Nicole flowed a vast tragic apathy.

“It was instinct,” Dick said, finally. “He was really dying, but he tried to get a resumption of rhythm—he’s not the first person that ever walked off his death-bed—like an old clock—you know, you shake it and somehow from sheer habit it gets going again. Now your father—”

“Oh, don’t tell me,” she said.

“His principal fuel was fear,” he continued. “He got afraid, and off he went. He’ll probably live till ninety—”

“Please don’t tell me any more,” she said. “Please don’t—I couldn’t stand any more.”

“All right. The little devil I came down to see is hopeless. We may as well go back to-morrow.”

“I don’t see why you have to—come in contact with all this,” she burst forth.

“Oh, don’t you? Sometimes I don’t either.”

She put her hand on his.

“Oh, I’m sorry I said that, Dick.”

Some one had brought a phonograph into the bar and they sat listening to “The Wedding of the Painted Doll.”

One morning a week later, stopping at the desk for his mail, Dick became aware of some extra commotion outside: Patient Von Cohn Morris was going away. His parents, Australians, were putting his baggage vehemently into a large limousine, and beside them stood Doctor Lladislau protesting with ineffectual attitudes against the violent gesturings of Morris, senior. The young man was regarding his embarkation with aloof cynicism as Doctor Diver approached.

“Isn’t this a little sudden, Mr. Morris?”

Mr. Morris started as he saw Dick—his florid face and the large checks on his suit seemed to turn off and on like electric lights. He approached Dick as though to strike him.

“High time we left, we and those who have come with us,” he began, and paused for breath. “It is high time, Doctor Diver. High time.”

“Will you come in my office?” Dick suggested.

“Not I! I’ll talk to you, but I’m washing my hands of you and your place.”

“I’m sorry about that.”

He shook his finger at Dick. “I was just telling this doctor here. We’ve wasted our time and our money.”

Doctor Lladislau stirred in a feeble negative, signalling up a vague Slavic evasiveness. Dick had never liked Lladislau. He managed to walk the excited Australian along the path in the direction of his office, trying to persuade him toenter; but the man shook his head.

“It’s you, Doctor Diver, you, the very man. I went to Doctor Lladislau because you were not to be found, Doctor Diver, and because Doctor Gregorovious is not expected until the nightfall, and I would not wait. No, sir! I would not wait a minute after my son told me the truth.”

He came up menacingly to Dick, who kept his hands loose enough to drop him if it seemed necessary. “My son is here for alcoholism, and he told us he smelt liquor on your breath. Yes, sir!” He made a quick, apparently unsuccessful sniff. “Not once, but twice Von Cohn says he has smelt liquor on your breath. I and my lady have never touched a drop of it in our lives. We hand Von Cohn to you to be cured, and within a month he twice smells liquor on your breath! What kind of cure is that there?”

Dick hesitated; Mr. Morris was quite capable of making a scene on the clinic drive.

“After all, Mr. Morris, some people are not going to give up what they regard as food because of your son—”

“But you’re a doctor, man!” cried Morris furiously. “When the workmen drink their beer that’s bad cess to them—but you’re here supposing to cure—”

“This has gone too far. Your son came to us because of kleptomania.”

“What was behind it?” The man was almost shrieking. “Drink—black drink. Do you know what color black is? It’s black! My own uncle was hung by the neck because of it, you hear! My son comes to a sanitarium, and a doctor reeks of it!”

“I must ask you to leave.”

“You ask me! We are leaving!”

“If you could be a little temperate we could tell you the results of the treatment to date. Naturally, since you feel as you do, we would not want your son as a patient—”

“You dare to use the word temperate to me?”

Dick called to Doctor Lladislau and as he approached, said:“Will you represent us in saying good-by to the patient and to his family?”

He bowed slightly to Morris and went into his office, and stood rigid for a moment just inside the door. He watched until they drove away, the gross parents, the bland, degenerate offspring: it was easy to prophesy the family’s swing around Europe, bullying their betters with hard ignorance and hard money. But what absorbed Dick after the disappearance of the caravan was the question as to what extent he had provoked this. He drank claret with each meal, took a night-cap, generally in the form of hot rum, and sometimes he tippled with gin in the afternoons—gin was the most difficult to detect on the breath. He was averaging a half-pint of alcohol a day, too much for his system to burn up.

Dismissing a tendency to justify himself, he sat down at his desk and wrote out, like a prescription, a régime that would cut his liquor in half. Doctors, chauffeurs, and Protestant clergymen could never smell of liquor, as could painters, brokers, cavalry leaders; Dick blamed himself only for indiscretion. But the matter was by no means clarified half an hour later when Franz, revivified by an Alpine fortnight, rolled up the drive, so eager to resume work that he was plunged in it before he reached his office. Dick met him there.

“How was Mount Everest?”

“We could very well have done Mount Everest the rate we were doing. We thought of it. How goes it all? How is my Kaethe, how is your Nicole?”

“All goes smooth domestically. But my God, Franz, we had a rotten scene this morning.”

“How? What was it?”

Dick walked around the room while Franz got in touch with his villa by telephone. After the family exchange was over, Dick said:“The Morris boy was taken away—there was a row.”

Franz’s buoyant face fell.

“I knew he’d left. I met Lladislau on the veranda.”

“What did Lladislau say?”

“Just that young Morris had gone—that you’d tell me about it. What about it?”

“The usual incoherent reasons.”

“He was a devil, that boy.”

“He was a case for anesthesia,” Dick agreed. “Anyhow, the father had beaten Lladislau into a colonial subject by the time I came along. What about Lladislau? Do we keep him? I say no—he’s not much of a man, he can’t seem to cope with anything.” Dick hesitated on the verge of the truth, swung away to give himself space within which to recapitulate. Franz perched on the edge of a desk, still in his linen duster and travelling gloves. Dick said:

“One of the remarks the boy made to his father was that your distinguished collaborator was a drunkard. The man is a fanatic, and the descendant seems to have caught traces of vin-du-pays on me.”

Franz sat down, musing on his lower lip. “You can tell me at length,” he said finally.

“Why not now?” Dick suggested. “You must know I’m the last man to abuse liquor.” His eyes and Franz’s glinted on each other, pair on pair.“Lladislau let the man get so worked up that I was on the defensive. It might have happened in front of patients, and you can imagine how hard it could be to defend yourself in a situation like that!”

Franz took off his gloves and coat. He went to the door and told the secretary, “Don’t disturb us.” Coming back into the room he flung himself at the long table and fooled with his mail, reasoning as little as is characteristic of people in such postures, rather summoning up a suitable mask for what he had to say.

“Dick, I know well that you are a temperate, well-balanced man, even though we do not entirely agree on the subject of alcohol. But a time has come—Dick, I must say frankly that I have been aware several times that you have had a drink when it was not the moment to have one. There is some reason. Why not try another leave of abstinence?”

“Absence,” Dick corrected him automatically. “It’s no solution for me to go away.”

They were both chafed, Franz at having his return marred and blurred.

“Sometimes you don’t use your common sense, Dick.”

“I never understood what common sense meant applied to complicated problems—unless it means that a general practitioner can perform a better operation than a specialist.”

He was seized by an overwhelming disgust for the situation. To explain, to patch—these were not natural functions at their age—better to continue with the cracked echo of an old truth in the ears.

“This is no go,” he said suddenly.

“Well, that’s occurred to me,” Franz admitted. “Your heart isn’t in this project any more, Dick.”

“I know. I want to leave—we could strike some arrangement about taking Nicole’s money out gradually.”

“I have thought about that too, Dick—I have seen this coming. I am able to arrange other backing, and it will be possible to take all your money out by the end of the year.”

Dick had not intended to come to a decision so quickly, nor was he prepared for Franz’s so ready acquiescence in the break, yet he was relieved. Not without desperation he had long felt the ethics of his profession dissolving into a lifeless mass.

The Divers would return to the Riviera, which was home. The Villa Diana had been rented again for the summer, so they divided the intervening time between German spas and French cathedral towns where they were always happy for a few days. Dick wrote a little with no particular method; it was one of those parts of life that is an awaiting; not upon Nicole’s health, which seemed to thrive on travel, nor upon work, but simply an awaiting. The factor that gave purposefulness to the period was the children.

Dick’s interest in them increased with their ages, now eleven and nine. He managed to reach them over the heads of employees on the principle that both the forcing of children and the fear of forcing them were inadequate substitutes for the long, careful watchfulness, the checking and balancing and reckoning of accounts, to the end that there should be no slip below a certain level of duty. He came to know them much better than Nicole did, and in expansive moods over the wines of several countries he talked and played with them at length. They had that wistful charm, almost sadness, peculiar to children who have learned early not to cry or laugh with abandon; they were apparently moved to no extremes of emotion, but content with a simple regimentation and the simple pleasures allowed them. They lived on the even tenor found advisable in the experience of old families of the Western world, brought up rather than brought out. Dick thought, for example, that nothing was more conducive to the development of observation than compulsory silence.

Lanier was an unpredictable boy with an inhuman curiosity. “Well, how many Pomeranians would it take to lick a lion, father?” was typical of the questions with which he harassed Dick. Topsy was easier. She was nine and very fair and exquisitely made like Nicole, and in the past Dick had worried about that. Lately she had become as robust as any American child. He was satisfied with them both, but conveyed the fact to them only in a tacit way. They were not let off breaches of good conduct—“Either one learns politeness at home,” Dick said, “or the world teaches it to you with a whip and you may get hurt in the process. What do I care whether Topsy ‘adores’ me or not? I’m not bringing her up to be my wife.”

Another element that distinguished this summer and autumn for the Divers was a plenitude of money. Due to the sale of their interest in the clinic, and to developments in America, there was now so much that the mere spending of it, the care of goods, was an absorption in itself. The style in which they travelled seemed fabulous.

Regard them, for example, as the train slows up at Boyen where they are to spend a fortnight visiting. The shifting from the wagon-lit has begun at the Italian frontier. The governess’s maid and Madame Diver’s maid have come up from second class to help with the baggage and the dogs. Mlle. Bellois will superintend the hand-luggage, leaving the Sealyhams to one maid and the pair of Pekinese to the other. It is not necessarily poverty of spirit that makes a woman surround herself with life—it can be a superabundance of interest, and, except during her flashes of illness. Nicole was capable of being curator of it all. For example with the great quantity of heavy baggage—presently from the van would be unloaded four wardrobe trunks, a shoe trunk, three hat trunks, and two hat boxes, a chest of servants’ trunks, a portable filing-cabinet, a medicine case, a spirit lamp container, a picnic set, four tennis rackets in presses and cases, a phonograph, a typewriter. Distributed among the spaces reserved for family and entourage were two dozen supplementary grips, satchels and packages, each one numbered, down to the tag on the cane case. Thus all of it could be checked up in two minutes on any station platform, some for storage, some for accompaniment from the “light trip list” or the “heavy trip list,” constantly revised, and carried on metal-edged plaques in Nicole’s purse. She had devised the system as a child when travelling with her failing mother. It was equivalent to the system of a regimental supply officer who must think of the bellies and equipment of three thousand men.

The Divers flocked from the train into the early gathered twilight of the valley. The village people watched the debarkation with an awe akin to that which followed the Italian pilgrimages of Lord Byron a century before. Their hostess was the Contessa di Minghetti, lately Mary North. The journey that had begun in a room over the shop of a paperhanger in Newark had ended in an extraordinary marriage.

“Conte di Minghetti” was merely a papal title—the wealth of Mary’s husband flowed from his being ruler-owner of manganese deposits in southwestern Asia. He was not quite light enough to travel in a Pullman south of Mason-Dixon; he was of the Kabyle-Berber-Sabaean-Hindu strain that belts across north Africa and Asia, more sympathetic to the European than the mongrel faces of the ports.

When these princely households, one of the East, one of the West, faced each other on the station platform, the splendor of the Divers seemed pioneer simplicity by comparison. Their hosts were accompanied by an Italian major-domo carrying a staff, by a quartet of turbaned retainers on motorcycles, and by two half-veiled females who stood respectfully a little behind Mary and salaamed at Nicole, making her jump with the gesture.

To Mary as well as to the Divers the greeting was faintly comic; Mary gave an apologetic, belittling giggle; yet her voice, as she introduced her husband by his Asiatic title, flew proud and high.

In their rooms as they dressed for dinner, Dick and Nicole grimaced at each other in an awed way: such rich as want to be thought democratic pretend in private to be swept off their feet by swank.

“Little Mary North knows what she wants,” Dick muttered through his shaving cream. “Abe educated her, and now she’s married to a Buddha. If Europe ever goes Bolshevik she’ll turn up as the bride of Stalin.”

Nicole looked around from her dressing-case. “Watch your tongue, Dick, will you?” But she laughed. “They’re very swell. The warships all fire at them or salute them or something. Mary rides in the royal bus in London.”

“All right,” he agreed. As he heard Nicole at the door asking for pins, he called, “I wonder if I could have some whiskey; I feel the mountain air!”

“She’ll see to it,” presently Nicole called through the bathroom door.“It was one of those women who were at the station. She has her veil off.”

“What did Mary tell you about life?” he asked.

“She didn’t say so much—she was interested in high life—she asked me a lot of questions about my genealogy and all that sort of thing, as if I knew anything about it. But it seems the bridegroom has two very tan children by another marriage—one of them ill with some Asiatic thing they can’t diagnose. I’ve got to warn the children. Sounds very peculiar to me. Mary will see how we’d feel about it.” She stood worrying a minute.

“She’ll understand,” Dick reassured her. “Probably the child’s in bed.”

At dinner Dick talked to Hosain, who had been at an English public school. Hosain wanted to know about stocks and about Hollywood and Dick, whipping up his imagination with champagne, told him preposterous tales.

“Billions?” Hosain demanded.

“Trillions,” Dick assured him.

“I didn’t truly realize—”

“Well, perhaps millions,” Dick conceded. “Every hotel guest is assigned a harem—or what amounts to a harem.”

“Other than the actors and directors?”

“Every hotel guest—even travelling salesmen. Why, they tried to send me up a dozen candidates, but Nicole wouldn’t stand for it.”

Nicole reproved him when they were in their room alone. “Why so many highballs? Why did you use your word spic in front of him?”

“Excuse me, I meant smoke. The tongue slipped.”

“Dick, this isn’t faintly like you.”

“Excuse me again. I’m not much like myself any more.”

That night Dick opened a bathroom window, giving on a narrow and tubular court of the château, gray as rats but echoing at the moment to plaintive and peculiar music, sad as a flute. Two men were chanting in an Eastern language or dialect full of k’s and l’s—he leaned out but he could not see them; there was obviously a religious significance in the sounds, and tired and emotionless he let them pray for him too, but what for, save that he should not lose himself in his increasing melancholy, he did not know.

Next day, over a thinly wooded hillside they shot scrawny birds, distant poor relations to the partridge. It was done in a vague imitation of the English manner, with a corps of inexperienced beaters whom Dick managed to miss by firing only directly overhead.

On their return Lanier was waiting in their suite.

“Father, you said tell you immediately if we were near the sick boy.”

Nicole whirled about, immediately on guard.

“—so, Mother,” Lanier continued, turning to her, “the boy takes a bath every evening and to-night he took his bath just before mine and I had to take mine in his water, and it was dirty.”

“What? Now what?”

“I saw them take Tony out of it, and then they called me into it and the water was dirty.”

“But—did you take it?”

“Yes, Mother.”

“Heavens!” she exclaimed to Dick.

He demanded:“Why didn’t Lucienne draw your bath?”

“Lucienne can’t. It’s a funny heater—it reached out of itself and burned her arm last night and she’s afraid of it, so one of those two women—”

“You go in this bathroom and take a bath now.”

“Don’t say I told you,” said Lanier from the doorway.

Dick went in and sprinkled the tub with sulphur; closing the door he said to Nicole:

“Either we speak to Mary or we’d better get out.”

She agreed and he continued:“People think their children are constitutionally cleaner than other people’s, and their diseases are less contagious.”

Dick came in and helped himself from the decanter, chewing a biscuit savagely in the rhythm of the pouring water in the bathroom.

“Tell Lucienne that she’s got to learn about the heater—” he suggested. At that moment the Asiatic woman came in person to the door.

“El Contessa—”

Dick beckoned her inside and closed the door.

“Is the little sick boy better?” he inquired pleasantly.

“Better, yes, but he still has the eruptions frequently.”

“That’s too bad—I’m very sorry. But you see our children mustn’t be bathed in his water. That’s out of the question—I’m sure your mistress would be furious if she had known you had done a thing like that.”

“I?” She seemed thunderstruck. “Why, I merely saw your maid had difficulty with the heater—I told her about it and started the water.”

“But with a sick person you must empty the bathwater entirely out, and clean the tub.”

“I?”

Chokingly the woman drew a long breath, uttered a convulsed sob and rushed from the room.

“She mustn’t get up on western civilization at our expense,” he said grimly.

At dinner that night he decided that it must inevitably be a truncated visit: about his own country Hosain seemed to have observed only that there were many mountains and some goats and herders of goats. He was a reserved young man—to draw him out would have required the sincere effort that Dick now reserved for his family. Soon after dinner Hosain left Mary and the Divers to themselves, but the old unity was split—between them lay the restless social fields that Mary was about to conquer. Dick was relieved when, at nine-thirty, Mary received and read a note and got up.

“You’ll have to excuse me. My husband is leaving on a short trip—and I must be with him.”

Next morning, hard on the heels of the servant bringing coffee, Mary entered their room. She was dressed and they were not dressed, and she had the air of having been up for some time. Her face was toughened with quiet jerky fury.

“What is this story about Lanier having been bathed in a dirty bath?”

Dick began to protest, but she cut through:

“What is this story that you commanded my husband’s sister to clean Lanier’s tub?”

She remained on her feet staring at them, as they sat impotent as idols in their beds, weighted by their trays. Together they exclaimed:“His Sister!”

“That you ordered one of his sisters to clean out a tub!”

“We didn’t—” their voices rang together saying the same thing, “—I spoke to the native servant—”

“You spoke to Hosain’s sister.”

Dick could only say:“I supposed they were two maids.”

“You were told they were Himadoun.”

“What?” Dick got out of bed and into a robe.

“I explained it to you at the piano night before last. Don’t tell me you were too merry to understand.”

“Was that what you said? I didn’t hear the beginning. I didn’t connect the—we didn’t make any connection, Mary. Well, all we can do is see her and apologize.”

“See her and apologize! I explained to you that when the oldest member of the family—when the oldest one marries, well, the two oldest sisters consecrate themselves to being Himadoun, to being his wife’s ladies-in-waiting.”

“Was that why Hosain left the house last night?”

Mary hesitated; then nodded.

“He had to—they all left. His honor makes it necessary.”

Now both the Divers were up and dressing; Mary went on:

“And what’s all that about the bathwater. As if a thing like that could happen in this house! We’ll ask Lanier about it.”

Dick sat on the bedside indicating in a private gesture to Nicole that she should take over. Meanwhile Mary went to the door and spoke to an attendant in Italian.

“Wait a minute,” Nicole said. “I won’t have that.”

“You accused us,” answered Mary, in a tone she had never used to Nicole before. “Now I have a right to see.”

“I won’t have the child brought in.” Nicole threw on her clothes as though they were chain mail.

“That’s all right,” said Dick. “Bring Lanier in. We’ll settle this bathtub matter—fact or myth.”

Lanier, half clothed mentally and physically, gazed at the angered faces of the adults.

“Listen, Lanier,” Mary demanded, “how did you come to think you were bathed in water that had been used before?”

“Speak up,” Dick added.

“It was just dirty, that was all.”

“Couldn’t you hear the new water running, from your room, next door?”

Lanier admitted the possibility but reiterated his point—the water was dirty. He was a little awed; he tried to see ahead:

“It couldn’t have been running, because—”

They pinned him down.

“Why not?”

He stood in his little kimono arousing the sympathy of his parents and further arousing Mary’s impatience—then he said:

“The water was dirty, it was full of soap-suds.”

“When you’re not sure what you’re saying—” Mary began, but Nicole interrupted.

“Stop it, Mary. If there were dirty suds in the water it was logical to think it was dirty. His father told him to come—”

“There couldn’t have been dirty suds in the water.”

Lanier looked reproachfully at his father, who had betrayed him. Nicole turned him about by the shoulders and sent him out of the room; Dick broke the tensity with a laugh.

Then, as if the sound recalled the past, the old friendship, Mary guessed how far away from them she had gone and said in a mollifying tone:“It’s always like that with children.”

Her uneasiness grew as she remembered the past. “You’d be silly to go—Hosain wanted to make this trip anyhow. After all, you’re my guests and you just blundered into the thing.” But Dick, made more angry by this obliqueness and the use of the word blunder, turned away and began arranging his effects, saying:

“It’s too bad about the young women. I’d like to apologize to the one who came in here.”

“If you’d only listened on the piano seat!”

“But you’ve gotten so damned dull, Mary. I listened as long as I could.”

“Be quiet!” Nicole advised him.

“I return his compliment,” said Mary bitterly. “Good-by, Nicole.” She went out.

After all that there was no question of her coming to see them off; the major-domo arranged the departure. Dick left formal notes for Hosain and the sisters. There was nothing to do except to go, but all of them, especially Lanier, felt bad about it.

“I insist,” insisted Lanier on the train, “that it was dirty bathwater.”

“That’ll do,” his father said. “You better forget it—unless you want me to divorce you. Did you know there was a new law in France that you can divorce a child?”

Lanier roared with delight and the Divers were unified again—Dick wondered how many more times it could be done.





5


Nicole went to the window and bent over the sill to take a look at the rising altercation on the terrace; the April sun shone pink on the saintly face of Augustine, the cook, and blue on the butcher’s knife she waved in her drunken hand. She had been with them since their return to Villa Diana in February.

Because of an obstruction of an awning she could see only Dick’s head and his hand holding one of his heavy canes with a bronze knob on it. The knife and the cane, menacing each other, were like tripos and short sword in a gladiatorial combat. Dick’s words reached her first:

“—care how much kitchen wine you drink but when I find you digging into a bottle of Chablis Mouton—”

“You talk about drinking!” Augustine cried, flourishing her sabre.“You drink—all the time!”

Nicole called over the awning:“What’s the matter, Dick?” and he answered in English:

“The old girl has been polishing off the vintage wines. I’m firing her—at least I’m trying to.”

“Heavens! Well, don’t let her reach you with that knife.”

Augustine shook her knife up at Nicole. Her old mouth was made of two small intersecting cherries.

“I would like to say, Madame, if you knew that your husband drinks over at his bastide comparatively as a day-laborer—”

“Shut up and get out!” interrupted Nicole. “We’ll get the gendarmes.”

“You’ll get the gendarmes! With my brother in the corps! You—a disgusting American?”

In English Dick called up to Nicole:

“Get the children away from the house till I settle this.”

“—disgusting Americans who come here and drink up our finest wines,” screamed Augustine with the voice of the commune.

Dick mastered a firmer tone.

“You must leave now! I’ll pay you what we owe you.”

“Very sure you’ll pay me! And let me tell you—” she came close and waved the knife so furiously that Dick raised his stick, whereupon she rushed into the kitchen and returned with the carving knife reinforced by a hatchet.

The situation was not prepossessing—Augustine was a strong woman and could be disarmed only at the risk of serious results to herself—and severe legal complications which were the lot of one who molested a French citizen. Trying a bluff Dick called up to Nicole:

“Phone the poste de police.” Then to Augustine, indicating her armament, “This means arrest for you.”

“Ha-ha!” she laughed demoniacally; nevertheless she came no nearer. Nicole phoned the police but was answered with what was almost an echo of Augustine’s laugh. She heard mumbles and passings of the word around—the connection was suddenly broken.

Returning to the window she called down to Dick:“Give her something extra!”

“If I could get to that phone!” As this seemed impracticable, Dick capitulated. For fifty francs, increased to a hundred as he succumbed to the idea of getting her out hastily, Augustine yielded her fortress, covering the retreat with stormy grenades of “Salaud!” She would leave only when her nephew could come for her baggage. Waiting cautiously in the neighborhood of the kitchen Dick heard a cork pop, but he yielded the point. There was no further trouble—when the nephew arrived, all apologetic, Augustine bade Dick a cheerful, convivial good-by and called up “Au revoir, Madame! Bonne chance!” to Nicole’s window.

The Divers went to Nice and dined on a bouillabaisse, which is a stew of rock fish and small lobsters, highly seasoned with saffron, and a bottle of cold Chablis. He expressed pity for Augustine.

“I’m not sorry a bit,” said Nicole.

“I’m sorry—and yet I wish I’d shoved her over the cliff.”

There was little they dared talk about in these days; seldom did they find the right word when it counted, it arrived always a moment too late when one could not reach the other any more. To-night Augustine’s outburst had shaken them from their separate reveries; with the burn and chill of the spiced broth and the parching wine they talked.

“We can’t go on like this,” Nicole suggested. “Or can we?—what do you think?” Startled that for the moment Dick did not deny it, she continued, “Some of the time I think it’s my fault—I’ve ruined you.”

“So I’m ruined, am I?” he inquired pleasantly.

“I didn’t mean that. But you used to want to create things—now you seem to want to smash them up.”

She trembled at criticizing him in these broad terms—but his enlarging silence frightened her even more. She guessed that something was developing behind the silence, behind the hard, blue eyes, the almost unnatural interest in the children. Uncharacteristic bursts of temper surprised her—he would suddenly unroll a long scroll of contempt for some person, race, class, way of life, way of thinking. It was as though an incalculable story was telling itself inside him, about which she could only guess at in the moments when it broke through the surface.

“After all, what do you get out of this?” she demanded.

“Knowing you’re stronger every day. Knowing that your illness follows the law of diminishing returns.”

His voice came to her from far off, as though he were speaking of something remote and academic; her alarm made her exclaim, “Dick!” and she thrust her hand forward to his across the table. A reflex pulled Dick’s hand back and he added:“There’s the whole situation to think of, isn’t there? There’s not just you.” He covered her hand with his and said in the old pleasant voice of a conspirator for pleasure, mischief, profit, and delight:

“See that boat out there?”

It was the motor yacht of T. F. Golding lying placid among the little swells of the Nicean bay, constantly bound upon a romantic voyage that was not dependent upon actual motion. “We’ll go out there now and ask the people on board what’s the matter with them. We’ll find out if they’re happy.”

“We hardly know him,” Nicole objected.

“He urged us. Besides, Baby knows him—she practically married him, doesn’t she—didn’t she?”

When they put out from the port in a hired launch it was already summer dusk and lights were breaking out in spasms along the rigging of the Margin. As they drew up alongside, Nicole’s doubts reasserted themselves.

“He’s having a party—”

“It’s only a radio,” he guessed.

They were hailed—a huge white-haired man in a white suit looked down at them, calling:

“Do I recognize the Divers?”

“Boat ahoy, Margin!”

Their boat moved under the companionway; as they mounted Golding doubled his huge frame to give Nicole a hand.

“Just in time for dinner.”

A small orchestra was playing astern.

I’m yours for the asking—but till then

You can’t ask me to behave—

And as Golding’s cyclonic arms blew them aft without touching them, Nicole was sorrier they had come, and more impatient at Dick. Having taken up an attitude of aloofness from the gay people here, at the time when Dick’s work and her health were incompatible with going about, they had a reputation as refusers. Riviera replacements during the ensuing years interpreted this as a vague unpopularity. Nevertheless, having taken such a stand, Nicole felt it should not be cheaply compromised for a momentary self-indulgence.

As they passed through the principal salon they saw ahead of them figures that seemed to dance in the half light of the circular stern. This was an illusion made by the enchantment of the music, the unfamiliar lighting, and the surrounding presence of water. Actually, save for some busy stewards, the guests loafed on a wide divan that followed the curve of the deck. There were a white, a red, a blurred dress, the laundered chests of several men, of whom one, detaching and identifying himself, brought from Nicole a rare little cry of delight.

“Tommy!”

Brushing aside the Gallicism of his formal dip at her hand, Nicole pressed her face against his. They sat, or rather lay down together on the Antoninian bench. His handsome face was so dark as to have lost the pleasantness of deep tan, without attaining the blue beauty of negroes—it was just worn leather. The foreignness of his depigmentation by unknown suns, his nourishment by strange soils, his tongue awkward with the curl of many dialects, his reactions attuned to odd alarms—these things fascinated and rested Nicole—in the moment of meeting she lay on his bosom, spiritually, going out and out…. Then self-preservation reasserted itself and retiring to her own world she spoke lightly.

“You look just like all the adventurers in the movies—but why do you have to stay away so long?”

Tommy Barban looked at her, uncomprehending but alert; the pupils of his eyes flashed.

“Five years,” she continued, in throaty mimicry of nothing. “Much too long. Couldn’t you only slaughter a certain number of creatures and then come back, and breathe our air for a while?”

In her cherished presence Tommy Europeanized himself quickly.

“Mais pour nous héros,” he said, “il nous faut du temps, Nicole. Nous ne pouvons pas faire de petits exercises d’héroïsme—il faut faire les grandes compositions.”

“Talk English to me, Tommy.”

“Parlez français avec moi, Nicole.”

“But the meanings are different—in French you can be heroic and gallant with dignity, and you know it. But in English you can’t be heroic and gallant without being a little absurd, and you know that too. That gives me an advantage.”

“But after all—” He chuckled suddenly. “Even in English I’m brave, heroic and all that.”

She pretended to be groggy with wonderment but he was not abashed.

“I only know what I see in the cinema,” he said.

“Is it all like the movies?”

“The movies aren’t so bad—now this Ronald Colman—have you seen his pictures about the Corps d’Afrique du Nord? They’re not bad at all.”

“Very well, whenever I go to the movies I’ll know you’re going through just that sort of thing at that moment.”

As she spoke, Nicole was aware of a small, pale, pretty young woman with lovely metallic hair, almost green in the deck lights, who had been sitting on the other side of Tommy and might have been part either of their conversation or of the one next to them. She had obviously had a monopoly of Tommy, for now she abandoned hope of his attention with what was once called ill grace, and petulantly crossed the crescent of the deck.

“After all, I am a hero,” Tommy said calmly, only half joking. “I have ferocious courage, usually, something like a lion, something like a drunken man.”

Nicole waited until the echo of his boast had died away in his mind—she knew he had probably never made such a statement before. Then she looked among the strangers, and found as usual the fierce neurotics, pretending calm, liking the country only in horror of the city, of the sound of their own voices which had set the tone and pitch…. She asked:

“Who is the woman in white?”

“The one who was beside me? Lady Caroline Sibly-Biers.” They listened for a moment to her voice across the way:

“The man’s a scoundrel, but he’s a cat of the stripe. We sat up all night playing two-handed chemin-de-fer, and he owes me a mille Swiss.”

Tommy laughed and said:“She is now the wickedest woman in London—whenever I come back to Europe there is a new crop of the wickedest women from London. She’s the very latest—though I believe there is now one other who’s considered almost as wicked.”

Nicole glanced again at the woman across the deck—she was fragile, tubercular—it was incredible that such narrow shoulders, such puny arms could bear aloft the pennon of decadence, last ensign of the fading empire. Her resemblance was rather to one of John Held’s flat-chested flappers than to the hierarchy of tall languid blondes who had posed for painters and novelists since before the war.

Golding approached, fighting down the resonance of his huge bulk, which transmitted his will as through a gargantuan amplifier, and Nicole, still reluctant, yielded to his reiterated points: that the Margin was starting for Cannes immediately after dinner; that they could always pack in some caviare and champagne, even though they had dined; that in any case Dick was now on the phone, telling their chauffeur in Nice to drive their car back to Cannes and leave it in front of the Café des Alliés where the Divers could retrieve it.

They moved into the dining salon and Dick was placed next to Lady Caroline. Nicole saw that his usually ruddy face was drained of blood; he talked in a dogmatic voice, of which only snatches reached Nicole:

“…It’s all right for you English, you’re doing a dance of death…. Sepoys in the ruined fort, I mean Sepoys at the gate and gaiety in the fort and all that. The green hat, the crushed hat, no future.”

Lady Caroline answered him in short sentences spotted with the terminal “What?” the double-edged “Quite!” the depressing “Cheerio!” that always had a connotation of imminent peril, but Dick appeared oblivious to the warning signals. Suddenly he made a particularly vehement pronouncement, the purport of which eluded Nicole, but she saw the young woman turn dark and sinewy, and heard her answer sharply:

“After all a chep’s a chep and a chum’s a chum.”

Again he had offended some one—couldn’t he hold his tongue a little longer? How long? To death then.

At the piano, a fair-haired young Scotsman from the orchestra (entitled by its drum “The Ragtime College Jazzes of Edinboro”) had begun singing in a Danny Deever monotone, accompanying himself with low chords on the piano. He pronounced his words with great precision, as though they impressed him almost intolerably.

There was a young lady from hell,

Who jumped at the sound of a bell,

Because she was bad—bad—bad,

She jumped at the sound of a bell,

From hell (BOOMBOOM)

From hell (TOOTTOOT)

There was a young lady from hell—

“What is all this?” whispered Tommy to Nicole.

The girl on the other side of him supplied the answer:

“Caroline Sibly-Biers wrote the words. He wrote the music.”

“Quelle enfanterie!” Tommy murmured as the next verse began, hinting at the jumpy lady’s further predilections. “On dirait qu’il récite Racine!”

On the surface at least, Lady Caroline was paying no attention to the performance of her work. Glancing at her again Nicole found herself impressed, neither with the character nor the personality, but with the sheer strength derived from an attitude; Nicole thought that she was formidable, and she was confirmed in this point of view as the party rose from table. Dick remained in his seat wearing an odd expression; then he crashed into words with a harsh ineptness.

“I don’t like innuendo in these deafening English whispers.”

Already half-way out of the room Lady Caroline turned and walked back to him; she spoke in a low clipped voice purposely audible to the whole company.

“You came to me asking for it—disparaging my countrymen, disparaging my friend, Mary Minghetti. I simply said you were observed associating with a questionable crowd in Lausanne. Is that a deafening whisper? Or does it simply deafen you?”

“It’s still not loud enough,” said Dick, a little too late. “So I am actually a notorious—”

Golding crushed out the phrase with his voice saying:

“What! What!” and moved his guests on out, with the threat of his powerful body. Turning the corner of the door Nicole saw that Dick was still sitting at the table. She was furious at the woman for her preposterous statement, equally furious at Dick for having brought them here, for having become fuddled, for having untipped the capped barbs of his irony, for having come off humiliated—she was a little more annoyed because she knew that her taking possession of Tommy Barban on their arrival had first irritated the Englishwoman.

A moment later she saw Dick standing in the gangway, apparently in complete control of himself as he talked with Golding; then for half an hour she did not see him anywhere about the deck and she broke out of an intricate Malay game, played with string and coffee beans, and said to Tommy:

“I’ve got to find Dick.”

Since dinner the yacht had been in motion westward. The fine night streamed away on either side, the Diesel engines pounded softly, there was a spring wind that blew Nicole’s hair abruptly when she reached the bow, and she had a sharp lesion of anxiety at seeing Dick standing in the angle by the flagstaff. His voice was serene as he recognized her.

“It’s a nice night.”

“I was worried.”

“Oh, you were worried?”

“Oh, don’t talk that way. It would give me so much pleasure to think of a little something I could do for you, Dick.”

He turned away from her, toward the veil of starlight over Africa.

“I believe that’s true, Nicole. And sometimes I believe that the littler it was, the more pleasure it would give you.”

“Don’t talk like that—don’t say such things.”

His face, wan in the light that the white spray caught and tossed back to the brilliant sky had none of the lines of annoyance she had expected. It was even detached; his eyes focussed upon her gradually as upon a chessman to be moved; in the same slow manner he caught her wrist and drew her near.

“You ruined me, did you?” he inquired blandly. “Then we’re both ruined. So—”

Cold with terror she put her other wrist into his grip. All right, she would go with him—again she felt the beauty of the night vividly in one moment of complete response and abnegation—all right, then—

—But now she was unexpectedly free and Dick turned his back sighing:“Tch! Tch!”

Tears streamed down Nicole’s face—in a moment she heard some one approaching; it was Tommy.

“You found him! Nicole thought maybe you jumped overboard, Dick,” he said, “because that little English poule slanged you.”

“It’d be a good setting to jump overboard,” said Dick mildly.

“Wouldn’t it?” agreed Nicole hastily. “Let’s borrow life preservers and jump over. I think we should do something spectacular. I feel that all our lives have been too restrained.”

Tommy sniffed from one to the other trying to breathe in the situation with the night. “We’ll go ask the Lady Beer-and-Ale what to do—she should know the latest things. And we should memorize her song ‘There was a young lady from l’enfer.’ I shall translate it, and make a fortune from its success at the Casino.”

“Are you rich, Tommy?” Dick asked him, as they retraced the length of the boat.

“Not as things go now. I got tired of the brokerage business and went away. But I have good stocks in the hands of friends who are holding it for me. All goes well.”

“Dick’s getting rich,” Nicole said. In reaction her voice had begun to tremble.

On the after deck Golding had fanned three pairs of dancers into action with his colossal paws. Nicole and Tommy joined them and Tommy remarked:“Dick seems to be drinking.”

“Only moderately,” she said loyally.

“There are those who can drink and those who can’t. Obviously Dick can’t. You ought to tell him not to.”

“I!” she exclaimed in amazement. “I tell Dick what he should do or shouldn’t do!”

But in a reticent way Dick was still vague and sleepy when they reached the pier at Cannes. Golding buoyed him down into the launch of the Margin whereupon Lady Caroline shifted her place conspicuously. On the dock he bowed good-by with exaggerated formality, and for a moment he seemed about to speed her with a salty epigram, but the bone of Tommy’s arm went into the soft part of his and they walked to the attendant car.

“I’ll drive you home,” Tommy suggested.

“Don’t bother—we can get a cab.”

“I’d like to, if you can put me up.”

On the back seat of the car Dick remained quiescent until the yellow monolith of Golfe-Juan was passed, and then the constant carnival at Juan-les-Pins where the night was musical and strident in many languages. When the car turned up the hill toward Tarmes, he sat up suddenly, prompted by the tilt of the vehicle, and delivered a peroration:

“A charming representative of the—” he stumbled momentarily,“—a firm of—bring me Brains addled à l’Anglaise.” Then he went into an appeased sleep, belching now and then contentedly into the soft warm darkness.

Next morning Dick came early into Nicole’s room. “I waited till I heard you up. Needless to say I feel badly about the evening—but how about no post-mortems?”

“I’m agreed,” she answered coolly, carrying her face to the mirror.

“Tommy drove us home? Or did I dream it?”

“You know he did.”

“Seems probable,” he admitted, “since I just heard him coughing. I think I’ll call on him.”

She was glad when he left her, for almost the first time in her life—his awful faculty of being right seemed to have deserted him at last.

Tommy was stirring in his bed, waking for café au lait.

“Feel all right?” Dick asked.

When Tommy complained of a sore throat he seized at a professional attitude.

“Better have a gargle or something.”

“You have one?”

“Oddly enough I haven’t—probably Nicole has.”

“Don’t disturb her.”

“She’s up.”

“How is she?”

Dick turned around slowly. “Did you expect her to be dead because I was tight?” His tone was pleasant. “Nicole is now made of—of Georgia pine, which is the hardest wood known, except lignum vitæ from New Zealand—”

Nicole, going downstairs, heard the end of the conversation. She knew, as she had always known, that Tommy loved her; she knew he had come to dislike Dick, and that Dick had realized it before he did, and would react in some positive way to the man’s lonely passion. This thought was succeeded by a moment of sheerly feminine satisfaction. She leaned over her children’s breakfast table and told off instructions to the governess, while upstairs two men were concerned about her.

Later in the garden she was happy; she did not want anything to happen, but only for the situation to remain in suspension as the two men tossed her from one mind to another; she had not existed for a long time, even as a ball.

“Nice, rabbits, isn’t it—Or is it? Hey, rabbit—hey you! Is it nice?—hey? Or does it sound very peculiar to you?”

The rabbit, after an experience of practically nothing else and cabbage leaves, agreed after a few tentative shiftings of the nose.

Nicole went on through her garden routine. She left the flowers she cut in designated spots to be brought to the house later by the gardener. Reaching the sea wall she fell into a communicative mood and no one to communicate with; so she stopped and deliberated. She was somewhat shocked at the idea of being interested in another man—but other women have lovers—why not me? In the fine spring morning the inhibitions of the male world disappeared and she reasoned as gaily as a flower, while the wind blew her hair until her head moved with it. Other women have had lovers—the same forces that last night had made her yield to Dick up to the point of death, now kept her head nodding to the wind, content and happy with the logic of, Why shouldn’t I?

She sat upon the low wall and looked down upon the sea. But from another sea, the wide swell of fantasy, she had fished out something tangible to lay beside the rest of her loot. If she need not, in her spirit, be forever one with Dick as he had appeared last night, she must be something in addition, not just an image on his mind, condemned to endless parades around the circumference of a medal.

Nicole had chosen this part of the wall on which to sit, because the cliff shaded to a slanting meadow with a cultivated vegetable garden. Through a cluster of boughs she saw two men carrying rakes and spades and talking in a counterpoint of Niçois and Provençal. Attracted by their words and gestures she caught the sense:

“I laid her down here.”

“I took her behind the vines there.”

“She doesn’t care—neither does he. It was that sacred dog. Well, I laid her down here—”

“You got the rake?”

“You got it yourself, you clown.”

“Well, I don’t care where you laid her down. Until that night I never even felt a woman’s breast against my chest since I married—twelve years ago. And now you tell me—”

“But listen about the dog—”

Nicole watched them through the boughs; it seemed all right what they were saying—one thing was good for one person, another for another. Yet it was a man’s world she had overheard; going back to the house she became doubtful again.

Dick and Tommy were on the terrace. She walked through them and into the house, brought out a sketch pad and began a head of Tommy.

“Hands never idle—distaff flying,” Dick said lightly. How could he talk so trivially with the blood still drained down from his cheeks so that the auburn lather of beard showed red as his eyes? She turned to Tommy saying:

“I can always do something. I used to have a nice active little Polynesian ape and juggle him around for hours till people began to make the most dismal rough jokes—”

She kept her eyes resolutely away from Dick. Presently he excused himself and went inside—she saw him pour himself two glasses of water, and she hardened further.

“Nicole—” Tommy began but interrupted himself to clear the harshness from his throat.

“I’m going to get you some special camphor rub,” she suggested. “It’s American—Dick believes in it. I’ll be just a minute.”

“I must go really.”

Dick came out and sat down. “Believes in what?” When she returned with the jar neither of the men had moved, though she gathered they had had some sort of excited conversation about nothing.

The chauffeur was at the door, with a bag containing Tommy’s clothes of the night before. The sight of Tommy in clothes borrowed from Dick moved her sadly, falsely, as though Tommy were not able to afford such clothes.

“When you get to the hotel rub this into your throat and chest and then inhale it,” she said.

“Say, there,” Dick murmured as Tommy went down the steps, “don’t give Tommy the whole jar—it has to be ordered from Paris—it’s out of stock down here.”

Tommy came back within hearing and the three of them stood in the sunshine, Tommy squarely before the car so that it seemed by leaning forward he would tip it upon his back.

Nicole stepped down to the path.

“Now catch it,” she advised him. “It’s extremely rare.”

She heard Dick grow silent at her side; she took a step off from him and waved as the car drove off with Tommy and the special camphor rub. Then she turned to take her own medicine.

“There was no necessity for that gesture,” Dick said. “There are four of us here—and for years whenever there’s a cough—”

They looked at each other.

“We can always get another jar—” then she lost her nerve and presently followed him upstairs where he lay down on his own bed and said nothing.

“Do you want lunch to be brought up to you?” she asked.

He nodded and continued to lie quiescent, staring at the ceiling. Doubtfully she went to give the order. Upstairs again she looked into his room—the blue eyes, like searchlights, played on a dark sky. She stood a minute in the doorway, aware of the sin she had committed against him, half afraid to come in…. She put out her hand as if to rub his head, but he turned away like a suspicious animal. Nicole could stand the situation no longer; in a kitchen-maid’s panic she ran downstairs, afraid of what the stricken man above would feed on while she must still continue her dry suckling at his lean chest.

In a week Nicole forgot her flash about Tommy—she had not much memory for people and forgot them easily. But in the first hot blast of June she heard he was in Nice. He wrote a little note to them both—and she opened it under the parasol, together with other mail they had brought from the house. After reading it she tossed it over to Dick, and in exchange he threw a telegram into the lap of her beach pajamas:

Dears will be at Gausses tomorrow unfortunately without mother am counting on seeing you.

ROSEMARY

“I’ll be glad to see her,” said Nicole, grimly.

But she went to the beach with Dick next morning with a renewal of her apprehension that Dick was contriving at some desperate solution. Since the evening on Golding’s yacht she had sensed what was going on. So delicately balanced was she between an old foothold that had always guaranteed her security, and the imminence of a leap from which she must alight changed in the very chemistry of blood and muscle, that she did not dare bring the matter into the true forefront of consciousness. The figures of Dick and herself, mutating, undefined, appeared as spooks caught up into a fantastic dance. For months every word had seemed to have an overtone of some other meaning, soon to be resolved under circumstances that Dick would determine. Though this state of mind was perhaps more hopeful—the long years of sheer being had had an enlivening effect on the parts of her nature that early illness had killed, that Dick had not reached, through no fault of his but simply because no one nature can extend entirely inside another—it was still disquieting. The most unhappy aspect of their relations was Dick’s growing indifference, at present personified by too much drink; Nicole did not know whether she was to be crushed or spared—Dick’s voice, throbbing with insincerity, confused the issue; she couldn’t guess how he was going to behave next upon the tortuously slow unrolling of the carpet, nor what would happen at the end, at the moment of the leap.

For what might occur thereafter she had no anxiety—she suspected that that would be the lifting of a burden, an unblinding of eyes. Nicole had been designed for change, for flight, with money as fins and wings. The new state of things would be no more than if a racing chassis, concealed for years under the body of a family limousine, should be stripped to its original self. Nicole could feel the fresh breeze already—the wrench it was she feared, and the dark manner of its coming.

The Divers went out on the beach with her white suit and his white trunks very white against the color of their bodies. Nicole saw Dick peer about for the children among the confused shapes and shadows of many umbrellas, and as his mind temporarily left her, ceasing to grip her, she looked at him with detachment, and decided that he was seeking his children, not protectively but for protection. Probably it was the beach he feared, like a deposed ruler secretly visiting an old court. She had come to hate his world with its delicate jokes and politenesses, forgetting that for many years it was the only world open to her. Let him look at it—his beach, perverted now to the tastes of the tasteless; he could search it for a day and find no stone of the Chinese Wall he had once erected around it, no footprint of an old friend.

For a moment Nicole was sorry it was so; remembering the glass he had raked out of the old trash heap, remembering the sailor trunks and sweaters they had bought in a Nice back street—garments that afterward ran through a vogue in silk among the Paris couturiers, remembering the simple little French girls climbing on the breakwaters crying “Dites donc! Dites donc!” like birds, and the ritual of the morning time, the quiet restful extraversion toward sea and sun—many inventions of his, buried deeper than the sand under the span of so few years….

Now the swimming place was a “club,” though, like the international society it represented, it would be hard to say who was not admitted.

Nicole hardened again as Dick knelt on the straw mat and looked about for Rosemary. Her eyes followed his, searching among the new paraphernalia, the trapezes over the water, the swinging rings, the portable bathhouses, the floating towers, the searchlights from last night’s fêtes, the modernistic buffet, white with a hackneyed motif of endless handlebars.

The water was almost the last place he looked for Rosemary, because few people swam any more in that blue paradise, children and one exhibitionistic valet who punctuated the morning with spectacular dives from a fifty-foot rock—most of Gausse’s guests stripped the concealing pajamas from their flabbiness only for a short hangover dip at one o’clock.

“There she is,” Nicole remarked.

She watched Dick’s eyes following Rosemary’s track from raft to raft; but the sigh that rocked out of her bosom was something left over from five years ago.

“Let’s swim out and speak to Rosemary,” he suggested.

“You go.”

“We’ll both go.” She struggled a moment against his pronouncement, but eventually they swam out together, tracing Rosemary by the school of little fish who followed her, taking their dazzle from her, the shining spoon of a trout hook.

Nicole stayed in the water while Dick hoisted himself up beside Rosemary, and the two sat dripping and talking, exactly as if they had never loved or touched each other. Rosemary was beautiful—her youth was a shock to Nicole, who rejoiced, however, that the young girl was less slender by a hairline than herself. Nicole swam around in little rings, listening to Rosemary who was acting amusement, joy, and expectation—more confident than she had been five years ago.

“I miss Mother so, but she’s meeting me in Paris, Monday.”

“Five years ago you came here,” said Dick. “And what a funny little thing you were, in one of those hotel peignoirs!”

“How you remember things! You always did—and always the nice things.”

Nicole saw the old game of flattery beginning again and she dove under water, coming up again to hear:

“I’m going to pretend it’s five years ago and I’m a girl of eighteen again. You could always make me feel some you know, kind of, you know, kind of happy way—you and Nicole. I feel as if you’re still on the beach there, under one of those umbrellas—the nicest people I’d ever known, maybe ever will.”

Swimming away, Nicole saw that the cloud of Dick’s heartsickness had lifted a little as he began to play with Rosemary, bringing out his old expertness with people, a tarnished object of art; she guessed that with a drink or so he would have done his stunts on the swinging rings for her, fumbling through stunts he had once done with ease. She noticed that this summer, for the first time, he avoided high diving.

Later, as she dodged her way from raft to raft, Dick overtook her.

“Some of Rosemary’s friends have a speed boat, the one out there.Do you want to aquaplane? I think it would be amusing.”

Remembering that once he could stand on his hands on a chair at the end of a board, she indulged him as she might have indulged Lanier. Last summer on the Zugersee they had played at that pleasant water game, and Dick had lifted a two-hundred-pound man from the board onto his shoulders and stood up. But women marry all their husbands’ talents and naturally, afterwards, are not so impressed with them as they may keep up the pretense of being. Nicole had not even pretended to be impressed, though she had said “Yes” to him, and “Yes, I thought so too.”

She knew, though, that he was somewhat tired, that it was only the closeness of Rosemary’s exciting youth that prompted the impending effort—she had seen him draw the same inspiration from the new bodies of her children and she wondered coldly if he would make a spectacle of himself. The Divers were older than the others in the boat—the young people were polite, deferential, but Nicole felt an undercurrent of “Who are these Numbers anyhow?” and she missed Dick’s easy talent of taking control of situations and making them all right—he had concentrated on what he was going to try to do.

The motor throttled down two hundred yards from shore and one of the young men dove flat over the edge. He swam at the aimless twisting board, steadied it, climbed slowly to his knees on it—then got on his feet as the boat accelerated. Leaning back he swung his light vehicle ponderously from side to side in slow, breathless arcs that rode the trailing side-swell at the end of each swing. In the direct wake of the boat he let go his rope, balanced for a moment, then back-flipped into the water, disappearing like a statue of glory, and reappearing as an insignificant head while the boat made the circle back to him.

Nicole refused her turn; then Rosemary rode the board neatly and conservatively, with facetious cheers from her admirers. Three of them scrambled egotistically for the honor of pulling her into the boat, managing, among them, to bruise her knee and hip against the side.

“Now you. Doctor,” said the Mexican at the wheel.

Dick and the last young man dove over the side and swam to the board. Dick was going to try his lifting trick and Nicole began to watch with smiling scorn. This physical showing-off for Rosemary irritated her most of all.

When the men had ridden long enough to find their balance, Dick knelt, and putting the back of his neck in the other man’s crotch, found the rope through his legs, and slowly began to rise.

The people in the boat, watching closely, saw that he was having difficulties. He was on one knee; the trick was to straighten all the way up in the same motion with which he left his kneeling position. He rested for a moment, then his face contracted as he put his heart into the strain, and lifted.

The board was narrow, the man, though weighing less than a hundred and fifty, was awkward with his weight and grabbed clumsily at Dick’s head. When, with a last wrenching effort of his back, Dick stood upright, the board slid sidewise and the pair toppled into the sea.

In the boat Rosemary exclaimed:“Wonderful! They almost had it.”

But as they came back to the swimmers Nicole watched for a sight of Dick’s face. It was full of annoyance as she expected, because he had done the thing with ease only two years ago.

The second time he was more careful. He rose a little testing the balance of his burden, settled down again on his knee; then, grunting“Alley oop!” began to rise—but before he could really straighten out, his legs suddenly buckled and he shoved the board away with his feet to avoid being struck as they fell off.

This time when the Baby Gar came back it was apparent to all the passengers that he was angry.

“Do you mind if I try that once more?” he called, treading water. “We almost had it then.”

“Sure. Go ahead.”

To Nicole he looked white-around-the-gills, and she cautioned him:

“Don’t you think that’s enough for now?”

He didn’t answer. The first partner had had plenty and was hauled over the side, the Mexican driving the motor boat obligingly took his place.

He was heavier than the first man. As the boat gathered motion, Dick rested for a moment, belly-down on the board. Then he got beneath the man and took the rope, and his muscles flexed as he tried to rise.

He could not rise. Nicole saw him shift his position and strain upward again but at the instant when the weight of his partner was full upon his shoulders he became immovable. He tried again—lifting an inch, two inches—Nicole felt the sweat glands of her forehead open as she strained with him—then he was simply holding his ground, then he collapsed back down on his knees with a smack, and they went over, Dick’s head barely missing a kick of the board.

“Hurry back!” Nicole called to the driver; even as she spoke she saw him slide under water and she gave a little cry; but he came up again and turned on his back, and the Mexican swam near to help. It seemed forever till the boat reached them but when they came alongside at last and Nicole saw Dick floating exhausted and expressionless, alone with the water and the sky, her panic changed suddenly to contempt.

“We’ll help you up, Doctor…. Get his foot… all right… now altogether….”

Dick sat panting and looking at nothing.

“I knew you shouldn’t have tried it,” Nicole could not help saying.

“He’d tired himself the first two times,” said the Mexican.

“It was a foolish thing,” Nicole insisted. Rosemary tactfully said nothing.

After a minute Dick got his breath, panting, “I couldn’t have lifted a paper doll that time.”

An explosive little laugh relieved the tension caused by his failure. They were all attentive to Dick as he disembarked at the dock. But Nicole was annoyed—everything he did annoyed her now.

She sat with Rosemary under an umbrella while Dick went to the buffet for a drink—he returned presently with some sherry for them.

“The first drink I ever had was with you,” Rosemary said, and with a spurt of enthusiasm she added, “Oh, I’m so glad to see you and know you’re all right. I was worried—” Her sentence broke as she changed direction “that maybe you wouldn’t be.”

“Did you hear I’d gone into a process of deterioration?”

“Oh, no. I simply—just heard you’d changed. And I’m glad to see with my own eyes it isn’t true.”

“It is true,” Dick answered, sitting down with them. “The change came a long way back—but at first it didn’t show. The manner remains intact for some time after the morale cracks.”

“Do you practise on the Riviera?” Rosemary demanded hastily.

“It’d be a good ground to find likely specimens.” He nodded here and there at the people milling about in the golden sand. “Great candidates. Notice our old friend, Mrs. Abrams, playing duchess to Mary North’s queen? Don’t get jealous about it—think of Mrs. Abram’s long climb up the back stairs of the Ritz on her hands and knees and all the carpet dust she had to inhale.”

Rosemary interrupted him. “But is that really Mary North?” She was regarding a woman sauntering in their direction followed by a small group who behaved as if they were accustomed to being looked at. When they were ten feet away, Mary’s glance flickered fractionally over the Divers, one of those unfortunate glances that indicate to the glanced-upon that they have been observed but are to be overlooked, the sort of glance that neither the Divers nor Rosemary Hoyt had ever permitted themselves to throw at any one in their lives. Dick was amused when Mary perceived Rosemary, changed her plans and came over. She spoke to Nicole with pleasant heartiness, nodded unsmilingly to Dick as if he were somewhat contagious—whereupon he bowed in ironic respect—as she greeted Rosemary.

“I heard you were here. For how long?”

“Until to-morrow,” Rosemary answered.

She, too, saw how Mary had walked through the Divers to talk to her, and a sense of obligation kept her unenthusiastic. No, she could not dine to-night.

Mary turned to Nicole, her manner indicating affection blended with pity.

“How are the children?” she asked.

They came up at the moment, and Nicole gave ear to a request that she overrule the governess on a swimming point.

“No,” Dick answered for her. “What Mademoiselle says must go.”

Agreeing that one must support delegated authority, Nicole refused their request, whereupon Mary—who in the manner of an Anita Loos heroine had dealings only with Faits Accomplis, who indeed could not have house-broken a French poodle puppy—regarded Dick as though he were guilty of a most flagrant bullying. Dick, chafed by the tiresome performance, inquired with mock solicitude:

“How are your children—and their aunts?”

Mary did not answer; she left them, first draping a sympathetic hand over Lanier’s reluctant head. After she had gone Dick said:“When I think of the time I spent working over her.”

“I like her,” said Nicole.

Dick’s bitterness had surprised Rosemary, who had thought of him as all-forgiving, all-comprehending. Suddenly she recalled what it was she had heard about him. In conversation with some State Department people on the boat—Europeanized Americans who had reached a position where they could scarcely have been said to belong to any nation at all, at least not to any great power though perhaps to a Balkan-like state composed of similar citizens—the name of the ubiquitously renowned Baby Warren had occurred and it was remarked that Baby’s younger sister had thrown herself away on a dissipated doctor. “He’s not received anywhere any more,” the woman said.

The phrase disturbed Rosemary, though she could not place the Divers as living in any relation to society where such a fact, if fact it was, could have any meaning, yet the hint of a hostile and organized public opinion rang in her ears. “He’s not received anywhere any more.” She pictured Dick climbing the steps of a mansion, presenting cards and being told by a butler:“We’re not receiving you any more;” then proceeding down an avenue only to be told the same thing by the countless other butlers of countless Ambassadors, Ministers, Chargés d’Affaires….

Nicole wondered how she could get away. She guessed that Dick, stung into alertness, would grow charming and would make Rosemary respond to him. Sure enough, in a moment his voice managed to qualify everything unpleasant he had said:

“Mary’s all right—she’s done very well. But it’s hard to go on liking people who don’t like you.”

Rosemary, falling into line, swayed toward Dick and crooned:

“Oh, you’re so nice. I can’t imagine anybody not forgiving you anything, no matter what you did to them.” Then feeling that her exuberance had transgressed on Nicole’s rights, she looked at the sand exactly between them:“I wanted to ask you both what you thought of my latest pictures—if you saw them.”

Nicole said nothing, having seen one of them and thought little about it.

“It’ll take a few minutes to tell you,” Dick said. “Let’s suppose that Nicole says to you that Lanier is ill. What do you do in life? What does anyone do? They act—face, voice, words—the face shows sorrow, the voice shows shock, the words show sympathy.”

“Yes—I understand.”

“But, in the theatre, No. In the theatre all the best comédiennes have built up their reputations by burlesquing the correct emotional responses—fear and love and sympathy.”

“I see.” Yet she did not quite see.

Losing the thread of it, Nicole’s impatience increased as Dick continued:

“The danger to an actress is in responding. Again, let’s suppose that somebody told you, ‘Your lover is dead.’ In life you’d probably go to pieces. But on the stage you’re trying to entertain—the audience can do the ‘responding’ for themselves. First the actress has lines to follow, then she has to get the audience’s attention back on herself, away from the murdered Chinese or whatever the thing is. So she must do something unexpected. If the audience thinks the character is hard she goes soft on them—if they think she’s soft she goes hard. You go all out of character—you understand?”

“I don’t quite,” admitted Rosemary. “How do you mean out of character?”

“You do the unexpected thing until you’ve manoeuvred the audience back from the objective fact to yourself. Then you slide into character again.”

Nicole could stand no more. She stood up sharply, making no attempt to conceal her impatience. Rosemary, who had been for a few minutes half-conscious of this, turned in a conciliatory way to Topsy.

“Would you like to be an actress when you grow up? I think you’d make a fine actress.”

Nicole stared at her deliberately and in her grandfather’s voice said, slow and distinct:

“It’s absolutely out to put such ideas in the heads of other people’s children. Remember, we may have quite different plans for them.” She turned sharply to Dick. “I’m going to take the car home. I’ll send Michelle for you and the children.”

“You haven’t driven for months,” he protested.

“I haven’t forgotten how.”

Without a glance at Rosemary whose face was “responding” violently, Nicole left the umbrella.

In the bathhouse, she changed to pajamas, her expression still hard as a plaque. But as she turned into the road of arched pines and the atmosphere changed,—with a squirrel’s flight on a branch, a wind nudging at the leaves, a cock splitting distant air, with a creep of sunlight transpiring through the immobility, then the voices of the beach receded—Nicole relaxed and felt new and happy; her thoughts were clear as good bells—she had a sense of being cured and in a new way. Her ego began blooming like a great rich rose as she scrambled back along the labyrinths in which she had wandered for years. She hated the beach, resented the places where she had played planet to Dick’s sun.

“Why, I’m almost complete,” she thought. “I’m practically standing alone, without him.” And like a happy child, wanting the completion as soon as possible, and knowing vaguely that Dick had planned for her to have it, she lay on her bed as soon as she got home and wrote Tommy Barban in Nice a short provocative letter.

But that was for the daytime—toward evening with the inevitable diminution of nervous energy, her spirits flagged, and the arrows flew a little in the twilight. She was afraid of what was in Dick’s mind; again she felt that a plan underlay his current actions and she was afraid of his plans—they worked well and they had an all-inclusive logic about them which Nicole was not able to command. She had somehow given over the thinking to him, and in his absences her every action seemed automatically governed by what he would like, so that now she felt inadequate to match her intentions against his. Yet think she must; she knew at last the number on the dreadful door of fantasy, the threshold to the escape that was no escape; she knew that for her the greatest sin now and in the future was to delude herself. It had been a long lesson but she had learned it. Either you think—or else others have to think for you and take power from you, pervert and discipline your natural tastes, civilize and sterilize you.

They had a tranquil supper with Dick drinking much beer and being cheerful with the children in the dusky room. Afterward he played some Schubert songs and some new jazz from America that Nicole hummed in her harsh, sweet contralto over his shoulder.

Thank y’ father-r

Thank y’ mother-r

Thanks for meetingup with one another—

“I don’t like that one,” Dick said, starting to turn the page.

“Oh, play it!” she exclaimed. “Am I going through the rest of life flinching at the word ‘father?’ ”

—Thank the horse that pulled the buggy that night!

Thank you both for being justabit tight—

Later they sat with the children on the Moorish roof and watched the fireworks of two casinos, far apart, far down on the shore. It was lonely and sad to be so empty-hearted toward each other.

Next morning, back from shopping in Cannes, Nicole found a note saying that Dick had taken the small car and gone up into Provence for a few days by himself. Even as she read it the phone rang—it was Tommy Barban from Monte Carlo, saying that he had received her letter and was driving over. She felt her lips’ warmth in the receiver as she welcomed his coming.





8


She bathed and anointed herself and covered her body with a layer of powder, while her toes crunched another pile on a bath towel. She looked microscopically at the lines of her flanks, wondering how soon the fine, slim edifice would begin to sink squat and earthward. In about six years, but now I’ll do—in fact I’ll do as well as any one I know.

She was not exaggerating. The only physical disparity between Nicole at present and the Nicole of five years before was simply that she was no longer a young girl. But she was enough ridden by the current youth worship, the moving pictures with their myriad faces of girl-children, blandly represented as carrying on the work and wisdom of the world, to feel a jealousy of youth.

She put on the first ankle-length day dress that she had owned for many years, and crossed herself reverently with Chanel Sixteen. When Tommy drove up at one o’clock she had made her person into the trimmest of gardens.

How good to have things like this, to be worshipped again, to pretend to have a mystery! She had lost two of the great arrogant years in the life of a pretty girl—now she felt like making up for them; she greeted Tommy as if he were one of many men at her feet, walking ahead of him instead of beside him as they crossed the garden toward the market umbrella. Attractive women of nineteen and of twenty-nine are alike in their breezy confidence; on the contrary, the exigent womb of the twenties does not pull the outside world centripetally around itself. The former are ages of insolence, comparable the one to a young cadet, the other to a fighter strutting after combat.

But whereas a girl of nineteen draws her confidence from a surfeit of attention, a woman of twenty-nine is nourished on subtler stuff. Desirous, she chooses her apéritifs wisely, or, content, she enjoys the caviare of potential power. Happily she does not seem, in either case, to anticipate the subsequent years when her insight will often be blurred by panic, by the fear of stopping or the fear of going on. But on the landings of nineteen or twenty-nine she is pretty sure that there are no bears in the hall.

Nicole did not want any vague spiritual romance—she wanted an“affair;” she wanted a change. She realized, thinking with Dick’s thoughts, that from a superficial view it was a vulgar business to enter, without emotion, into an indulgence that menaced all of them. On the other hand, she blamed Dick for the immediate situation, and honestly thought that such an experiment might have a therapeutic value. All summer she had been stimulated by watching people do exactly what they were tempted to do and pay no penalty for it—moreover, in spite of her intention of no longer lying to herself, she preferred to consider that she was merely feeling her way and that at any moment she could withdraw….

In the light shade Tommy caught her up in his white-duck arms and pulled her around to him, looking at her eyes.

“Don’t move,” he said. “I’m going to look at you a great deal from now on.”

There was some scent on his hair, a faint aura of soap from his white clothes. Her lips were tight, not smiling and they both simply looked for a moment.

“Do you like what you see?” she murmured.

“Parle français.”

“Very well,” and she asked again in French. “Do you like what you see?”

He pulled her closer.

“I like whatever I see about you.” He hesitated. “I thought I knew your face but it seems there are some things I didn’t know about it. When did you begin to have white crook’s eyes?”

She broke away, shocked and indignant, and cried in English:

“Is that why you wanted to talk French?” Her voice quieted as the butler came with sherry. “So you could be offensive more accurately?”

She parked her small seat violently on the cloth-of-silver chair cushion.

“I have no mirror here,” she said, again in French, but decisively,“but if my eyes have changed it’s because I’m well again. And being well perhaps I’ve gone back to my true self—I suppose my grandfather was a crook and I’m a crook by heritage, so there we are. Does that satisfy your logical mind?”

He scarcely seemed to know what she was talking about.

“Where’s Dick—is he lunching with us?”

Seeing that his remark had meant comparatively little to him she suddenly laughed away its effect.

“Dick’s on a tour,” she said. “Rosemary Hoyt turned up, and either they’re together or she upset him so much that he wants to go away and dream about her.”

“You know, you’re a little complicated after all.”

“Oh no,” she assured him hastily. “No, I’m not really—I’m just a—I’m just a whole lot of different simple people.”

Marius brought out melon and an ice pail, and Nicole, thinking irresistibly about her crook’s eyes did not answer; he gave one an entire nut to crack, this man, instead of giving it in fragments to pick at for meat.

“Why didn’t they leave you in your natural state?” Tommy demanded presently. “You are the most dramatic person I have known.”

She had no answer.

“All this taming of women!” he scoffed.

“In any society there are certain—” She felt Dick’s ghost prompting at her elbow but she subsided at Tommy’s overtone:

“I’ve brutalized many men into shape but I wouldn’t take a chance on half the number of women. Especially this ‘kind’ bullying—what good does it do anybody?—you or him or anybody?”

Her heart leaped and then sank faintly with a sense of what she owed Dick.

“I suppose I’ve got—”

“You’ve got too much money,” he said impatiently. “That’s the crux of the matter. Dick can’t beat that.”

She considered while the melons were removed.

“What do you think I ought to do?”

For the first time in ten years she was under the sway of a personality other than her husband’s. Everything Tommy said to her became part of her forever.

They drank the bottle of wine while a faint wind rocked the pine needles and the sensuous heat of early afternoon made blinding freckles on the checkered luncheon cloth. Tommy came over behind her and laid his arms along hers, clasping her hands. Their cheeks touched and then their lips and she gasped half with passion for him, half with the sudden surprise of its force….

“Can’t you send the governess and the children away for the afternoon?”

“They have a piano lesson. Anyhow I don’t want to stay here.”

“Kiss me again.”

A little later, riding toward Nice, she thought: So I have white crook’s eyes, have I? Very well then, better a sane crook than a mad puritan.

His assertion seemed to absolve her from all blame or responsibility and she had a thrill of delight in thinking of herself in a new way. New vistas appeared ahead, peopled with the faces of many men, none of whom she need obey or even love. She drew in her breath, hunched her shoulders with a wriggle and turned to Tommy.

“Have we got to go all the way to your hotel at Monte Carlo?”

He brought the car to a stop with a squeak of tires.

“No!” he answered. “And, my God, I have never been so happy as I am this minute.”

They had passed through Nice following the blue coast and begun to mount to the middling-high Corniche. Now Tommy turned sharply down to the shore, ran out a blunt peninsula, and stopped in the rear of a small shore hotel.

Its tangibility frightened Nicole for a moment. At the desk an American was arguing interminably with the clerk about the rate of exchange. She hovered, outwardly tranquil but inwardly miserable, as Tommy filled out the police blanks—his real, hers false. Their room was a Mediterranean room, almost ascetic, almost clean, darkened to the glare of the sea. Simplest of pleasures—simplest of places. Tommy ordered two cognacs, and when the door closed behind the waiter, he sat in the only chair, dark, scarred and handsome, his eyebrows arched and upcurling, a fighting Puck, an earnest Satan.

Before they had finished the brandy they suddenly moved together and met standing up; then they were sitting on the bed and he kissed her hardy knees. Struggling a little still, like a decapitated animal she forgot about Dick and her new white eyes, forgot Tommy himself and sank deeper and deeper into the minutes and the moment.

…When he got up to open a shutter and find out what caused the increasing clamor below their windows, his figure was darker and stronger than Dick’s, with high lights along the rope-twists of muscle. Momentarily he had forgotten her too—almost in the second of his flesh breaking from hers she had a foretaste that things were going to be different than she had expected. She felt the nameless fear which precedes all emotions, joyous or sorrowful, inevitable as a hum of thunder precedes a storm.

Tommy peered cautiously from the balcony and reported.

“All I can see is two women on the balcony below this. They’re talking about weather and tipping back and forth in American rocking-chairs.”

“Making all that noise?”

“The noise is coming from somewhere below them. Listen.”

Oh, way down South in the land of cotton

Hotels bum and business rotten

Look away—

“It’s Americans.”

Nicole flung her arms wide on the bed and stared at the ceiling; the powder had dampened on her to make a milky surface. She liked the bareness of the room, the sound of the single fly navigating overhead. Tommy brought the chair over to the bed and swept the clothes off it to sit down; she liked the economy of the weightless dress and espadrilles that mingled with his ducks upon the floor.

He inspected the oblong white torso joined abruptly to the brown limbs and head, and said, laughing gravely:

“You are all new like a baby.”

“With white eyes.”

“I’ll take care of that.”

“It’s very hard taking care of white eyes—especially the ones made in Chicago.”

“I know all the old Languedoc peasant remedies.”

“Kiss me, on the lips, Tommy.”

“That’s so American,” he said, kissing her nevertheless. “When I was in America last there were girls who would tear you apart with their lips, tear themselves too, until their faces were scarlet with the blood around the lips all brought out in a patch—but nothing further.”

Nicole leaned up on one elbow.

“I like this room,” she said.

He looked around.

“I find it somewhat meagre. Darling, I’m glad you wouldn’t wait until we got to Monte Carlo.”

“Why only meagre? Why, this is a wonderful room, Tommy—like the bare tables in so many Cézannes and Picassos.”

“I don’t know.” He did not try to understand her. “There’s that noise again. My God, has there been a murder?”

He went to the window and reported once more:

“It seems to be two American sailors fighting and a lot more cheering them on. They are from your battleship off shore.” He wrapped a towel around himself and went farther out on the balcony. “They have poules with them. I have heard about this now—the women follow them from place to place wherever the ship goes. But what women! One would think with their pay they could find better women! Why the women who followed Korniloff! Why we never looked at anything less than a ballerina!”

Nicole was glad he had known so many women, so that the word itself meant nothing to him; she would be able to hold him so long as the person in her transcended the universals of her body.

“Hit him where it hurts!”

“Yah-h-h-h!”

“Hey, what I tell you get inside that right!”

“Come on, Dulschmit, you son!”

“Yaa-Yaa!”

“YA-YEH-YAH!”

Tommy turned away.

“This place seems to have outlived its usefulness, you agree?”

She agreed, but they clung together for a moment before dressing, and then for a while longer it seemed as good enough a palace as any….

Dressing at last Tommy exclaimed:

“My God, those two women in the rocking-chairs on the balcony below us haven’t moved. They’re trying to talk this matter out of existence. They’re here on an economical holiday, and all the American navy and all the whores in Europe couldn’t spoil it.”

He came over gently and surrounded her, pulling the shoulder strap of her slip into place with his teeth; then a sound split the air outside: Cr-ACK—BOOM-M-m-m! It was the battleship sounding a recall.

Now, down below their window, it was pandemonium indeed—for the boat was moving to shores as yet unannounced. Waiters called accounts and demanded settlements in impassioned voices, there were oaths and denials; the tossing of bills too large and change too small; passouts were assisted to the boats, and the voices of the naval police chopped with quick commands through all voices. There were cries, tears, shrieks, promises as the first launch shoved off and the women crowded forward on the wharf, screaming and waving.

Tommy saw a girl rush out upon the balcony below waving a napkin, and before he could see whether or not the rocking Englishwomen gave in at last and acknowledged her presence, there was a knock at their own door. Outside, excited female voices made them agree to unlock it, disclosing two girls, young, thin and barbaric, unfound rather than lost, in the hall. One of them wept chokingly.

“Kwee wave off your porch?” implored the other in passionate American. “Kwee please? Wave at the boy friends? Kwee, please. The other rooms is all locked.”

“With pleasure,” Tommy said.

The girls rushed out on the balcony and presently their voices struck a loud treble over the din.

“ ’By, Charlie! Charlie, look up!”

“Send a wire gen’al alivery Nice!”

“Charlie! He don’t see me.”

One of the girls hoisted her skirt suddenly, pulled and ripped at her pink step-ins and tore them to a sizable flag; then, screaming “Ben! Ben!” she waved it wildly. As Tommy and Nicole left the room it still fluttered against the blue sky. Oh, say can you see the tender color of remembered flesh?—while at the stern of the battleship arose in rivalry the Star-Spangled Banner.

They dined at the new Beach Casino at Monte Carlo… much later they swam in Beaulieu in a roofless cavern of white moonlight formed by a circlet of pale boulders about a cup of phosphorescent water, facing Monaco and the blur of Menton. She liked his bringing her there to the eastward vision and the novel tricks of wind and water; it was all as new as they were to each other. Symbolically she lay across his saddle-bow as surely as if he had wolfed her away from Damascus and they had come out upon the Mongolian plain. Moment by moment all that Dick had taught her fell away and she was ever nearer to what she had been in the beginning, prototype of that obscure yielding up of swords that was going on in the world about her. Tangled with love in the moonlight she welcomed the anarchy of her lover.

They awoke together finding the moon gone down and the air cool. She struggled up demanding the time and Tommy called it roughly at three.

“I’ve got to go home then.”

“I thought we’d sleep in Monte Carlo.”

“No. There’s a governess and the children. I’ve got to roll in before daylight.”

“As you like.”

They dipped for a second, and when he saw her shivering he rubbed her briskly with a towel. As they got into the car with their heads still damp, their skins fresh and glowing, they were loath to start back. It was very bright where they were and as Tommy kissed her she felt him losing himself in the whiteness of her cheeks and her white teeth and her cool brow and the hand that touched his face. Still attuned to Dick, she waited for interpretation or qualification; but none was forthcoming. Reassured sleepily and happily that none would be, she sank low in the seat and drowsed until the sound of the motor changed and she felt them climbing toward Villa Diana. At the gate she kissed him an almost automatic good-by. The sound of her feet on the walk was changed, the night noises of the garden were suddenly in the past but she was glad, none the less, to be back. The day had progressed at a staccato rate, and in spite of its satisfactions she was not habituated to such strain.

At four o’clock next afternoon a station taxi stopped at the gate and Dick got out. Suddenly off balance, Nicole ran from the terrace to meet him, breathless with her effort at self-control.

“Where’s the car?” she asked.

“I left it in Arles. I didn’t feel like driving any more.”

“I thought from your note that you’d be several days.”

“I ran into a mistral and some rain.”

“Did you have fun?”

“Just as much fun as anybody has running away from things. I drove Rosemary as far as Avignon and put her on her train there.” They walked toward the terrace together, where he deposited his bag. “I didn’t tell you in the note because I thought you’d imagine a lot of things.”

“That was very considerate of you.” Nicole felt surer of herself now.

“I wanted to find out if she had anything to offer—the only way was to see her alone.”

“Did she have—anything to offer?”

“Rosemary didn’t grow up,” he answered. “It’s probably better that way. What have you been doing?”

She felt her face quiver like a rabbit’s.

“I went dancing last night—with Tommy Barban. We went—”

He winced, interrupting her.

“Don’t tell me about it. It doesn’t matter what you do, only I don’t want to know anything definitely.”

“There isn’t anything to know.”

“All right, all right.” Then as if he had been away a week:“How are the children?”

The phone rang in the house.

“If it’s for me I’m not home,” said Dick turning away quickly. “I’ve got some things to do over in the work-room.”

Nicole waited till he was out of sight behind the well; then she went into the house and took up the phone.

“Nicole, comment vas-tu?”

“Dick’s home.”

He groaned.

“Meet me here in Cannes,” he suggested. “I’ve got to talk to you.”

“I can’t.”

“Tell me you love me.” Without speaking she nodded at the receiver; he repeated, “Tell me you love me.”

“Oh, I do,” she assured him. “But there’s nothing to be done right now.”

“Of course there is,” he said impatiently. “Dick sees it’s over between you two—it’s obvious he has quit. What does he expect you to do?”

“I don’t know. I’ll have to—” She stopped herself from saying “—to wait until I can ask Dick,” and instead finished with:“I’ll write and I’ll phone you to-morrow.”

She wandered about the house rather contentedly, resting on her achievement. She was a mischief, and that was a satisfaction; no longer was she a huntress of corralled game. Yesterday came back to her now in innumerable detail—detail that began to overlay her memory of similar moments when her love for Dick was fresh and intact. She began to slight that love, so that it seemed to have been tinged with sentimental habit from the first. With the opportunistic memory of women she scarcely recalled how she had felt when she and Dick had possessed each other in secret places around the corners of the world, during the month before they were married. Just so had she lied to Tommy last night, swearing to him that never before had she so entirely, so completely, so utterly….

…then remorse for this moment of betrayal, which so cavalierly belittled a decade of her life, turned her walk toward Dick’s sanctuary.

Approaching noiselessly she saw him behind his cottage, sitting in a steamer chair by the cliff wall, and for a moment she regarded him silently. He was thinking, he was living a world completely his own and in the small motions of his face, the brow raised or lowered, the eyes narrowed or widened, the lips set and reset, the play of his hands, she saw him progress from phase to phase of his own story spinning out inside him, his own, not hers. Once he clenched his fists and leaned forward, once it brought into his face an expression of torment and despair—when this passed its stamp lingered in his eyes. For almost the first time in her life she was sorry for him—it is hard for those who have once been mentally afflicted to be sorry for those who are well, and though Nicole often paid lip service to the fact that he had led her back to the world she had forfeited, she had thought of him really as an inexhaustible energy, incapable of fatigue—she forgot the troubles she caused him at the moment when she forgot the troubles of her own that had prompted her. That he no longer controlled her—did he know that? Had he willed it all?—she felt as sorry for him as she had sometimes felt for Abe North and his ignoble destiny, sorry as for the helplessness of infants and the old.

She went up putting her arm around his shoulder and touching their heads together said:

“Don’t be sad.”

He looked at her coldly.

“Don’t touch me!” he said.

Confused she moved a few feet away.

“Excuse me,” he continued abstractedly. “I was just thinking what I thought of you—”

“Why not add the new classification to your book?”

“I have thought of it—‘Furthermore and beyond the psychoses and the neuroses—’ ”

“I didn’t come over here to be disagreeable.”

“Then why did you come, Nicole? I can’t do anything for you any more. I’m trying to save myself.”

“From my contamination.”

“Profession throws me in contact with questionable company sometimes.”

She wept with anger at the abuse.

“You’re a coward! You’ve made a failure of your life, and you want to blame it on me.”

While he did not answer she began to feel the old hypnotism of his intelligence, sometimes exercised without power but always with substrata of truth under truth which she could not break or even crack. Again she struggled with it, fighting him with her small, fine eyes, with the plush arrogance of a top dog, with her nascent transference to another man, with the accumulated resentment of years; she fought him with her money and her faith that her sister disliked him and was behind her now; with the thought of the new enemies he was making with his bitterness, with her quick guile against his wine-ing and dine-ing slowness, her health and beauty against his physical deterioration, her unscrupulousness against his moralities—for this inner battle she used even her weaknesses—fighting bravely and courageously with the old cans and crockery and bottles, empty receptacles of her expiated sins, outrages, mistakes. And suddenly, in the space of two minutes she achieved her victory and justified herself to herself without lie or subterfuge, cut the cord forever. Then she walked, weak in the legs, and sobbing coolly, toward the household that was hers at last.

Dick waited until she was out of sight. Then he leaned his head forward on the parapet. The case was finished. Doctor Diver was at liberty.





10


At two o’clock that night the phone woke Nicole and she heard Dick answer it from what they called the restless bed, in the next room.

“Oui, oui… mais à qui est-ce que je parle?… Oui….” His voice woke up with surprise. “But can I speak to one of the ladies, Sir the Officer? They are both ladies of the very highest prominence, ladies of connections that might cause political complications of the most serious…. It is a fact, I swear to you…. Very well, you will see.”

He got up and, as he absorbed the situation, his self-knowledge assured him that he would undertake to deal with it—the old fatal pleasingness, the old forceful charm, swept back with its cry of “Use me!” He would have to go fix this thing that he didn’t care a damn about, because it had early become a habit to be loved, perhaps from the moment when he had realized that he was the last hope of a decaying clan. On an almost parallel occasion, back in Dohmler’s clinic on the Zürichsee, realizing this power, he had made his choice, chosen Ophelia, chosen the sweet poison and drunk it. Wanting above all to be brave and kind, he had wanted, even more than that, to be loved. So it had been. So it would ever be, he saw, simultaneously with the slow archaic tinkle from the phone box as he rang off.

There was a long pause. Nicole called, “What is it? Who is it?”

Dick had begun to dress even as he hung up the phone.

“It’s the poste de police in Antibes—they’re holding Mary North and that Sibley-Biers. It’s something serious—the agent wouldn’t tell me; he kept saying ‘pas de mortes—pas d’automobiles’ but he implied it was just about everything else.”

“Why on earth did they call on you? It sounds very peculiar to me.”

“They’ve got to get out on bail to save their faces; and only some property owner in the Alpes-Maritimes can give bail.”

“They had their nerve.”

“I don’t mind. However I’ll pick up Gausse at the hotel—”

Nicole stayed awake after he had departed wondering what offense they could have committed; then she slept. A little after three when Dick came in she sat up stark awake saying, “What?” as if to a character in her dream.

“It was an extraordinary story—” Dick said. He sat on the foot of her bed, telling her how he had roused old Gausse from an Alsatian coma, told him to clean out his cash drawer, and driven with him to the police station.

“I don’t like to do something for that Anglaise,” Gausse grumbled.

Mary North and Lady Caroline, dressed in the costume of French sailors, lounged on a bench outside the two dingy cells. The latter had the outraged air of a Briton who momentarily expected the Mediterranean fleet to steam up to her assistance. Mary Minghetti was in a condition of panic and collapse—she literally flung herself at Dick’s stomach as though that were the point of greatest association, imploring him to do something. Meanwhile the chief of police explained the matter to Gausse who listened to each word with reluctance, divided between being properly appreciative of the officer’s narrative gift and showing that, as the perfect servant, the story had no shocking effect on him.

“It was merely a lark,” said Lady Caroline with scorn. “We were pretending to be sailors on leave, and we picked up two silly girls. They got the wind up and made a rotten scene in a lodging house.”

Dick nodded gravely, looking at the stone floor, like a priest in the confessional—he was torn between a tendency to ironic laughter and another tendency to order fifty stripes of the cat and a fortnight of bread and water. The lack, in Lady Caroline’s face, of any sense of evil, except the evil wrought by cowardly Provençal girls and stupid police, confounded him; yet he had long concluded that certain classes of English people lived upon a concentrated essence of the anti-social that, in comparison, reduced the gorgings of New York to something like a child contracting indigestion from ice cream.

“I’ve got to get out before Hosain hears about this,” Mary pleaded.“Dick, you can always arrange things—you always could. Tell ’em we’ll go right home, tell ’em we’ll pay anything.”

“I shall not,” said Lady Caroline disdainfully. “Not a shilling. But I shall jolly well find out what the Consulate in Cannes has to say about this.”

“No, no!” insisted Mary. “We’ve got to get out to-night.”

“I’ll see what I can do,” said Dick, and added, “but money will certainly have to change hands.” Looking at them as though they were the innocents that he knew they were not, he shook his head:“Of all the crazy stunts!”

Lady Caroline smiled complacently.

“You’re an insanity doctor, aren’t you? You ought to be able to help us—and Gausse has got to!”

At this point Dick went aside with Gausse and talked over the old man’s findings. The affair was more serious than had been indicated—one of the girls whom they had picked up was of a respectable family. The family were furious, or pretended to be; a settlement would have to be made with them. The other one, a girl of the port, could be more easily dealt with. There were French statutes that would make conviction punishable by imprisonment or, at the very least, public expulsion from the country. In addition to the difficulties, there was a growing difference in tolerance between such townspeople as benefited by the foreign colony and the ones who were annoyed by the consequent rise of prices. Gausse, having summarized the situation, turned it over to Dick. Dick called the chief of police into conference.

“Now you know that the French government wants to encourage American touring—so much so that in Paris this summer there’s an order that Americans can’t be arrested except for the most serious offenses.”

“This is serious enough, my God.”

“But look now—you have their Cartes d’Identité?”

“They had none. They had nothing—two hundred francs and some rings. Not even shoe-laces that they could have hung themselves with!”

Relieved that there had been no Cartes d’Identité Dick continued.

“The Italian Countess is still an American citizen. She is the grand-daughter—” he told a string of lies slowly and portentously, “of John D. Rockefeller Mellon. You have heard of him?”

“Yes, oh heavens, yes. You mistake me for a nobody?”

“In addition she is the niece of Lord Henry Ford and so connected with the Renault and Citroën companies—” He thought he had better stop here. However the sincerity of his voice had begun to affect the officer, so he continued:“To arrest her is just as if you arrested a great royalty of England. It might mean—War!”

“But how about the Englishwoman?”

“I’m coming to that. She is affianced to the brother of the Prince of Wales—the Duke of Buckingham.”

“She will be an exquisite bride for him.”

“Now we are prepared to give—” Dick calculated quickly, “one thousand francs to each of the girls—and an additional thousand to the father of the ‘serious’ one. Also two thousand in addition, for you to distribute as you think best—” he shrugged his shoulders, “—among the men who made the arrest, the lodging-house keeper and so forth. I shall hand you the five thousand and expect you to do the negotiating immediately. Then they can be released on bail on some charge like disturbing the peace, and whatever fine there is will be paid before the magistrate tomorrow—by messenger.”

Before the officer spoke Dick saw by his expression that it would be all right. The man said hesitantly, “I have made no entry because they have no Cartes d’Identité. I must see—give me the money.”

An hour later Dick and M. Gausse dropped the women by the Majestic Hotel, where Lady Caroline’s chauffeur slept in her landaulet.

“Remember,” said Dick, “you owe Monsieur Gausse a hundred dollars a piece.”

“All right,” Mary agreed, “I’ll give him a check to-morrow—and something more.”

“Not I!” Startled, they all turned to Lady Caroline, who, now entirely recovered, was swollen with righteousness. “The whole thing was an outrage. By no means did I authorize you to give a hundred dollars to those people.”

Little Gausse stood beside the car, his eyes blazing suddenly.

“You won’t pay me?”

“Of course she will,” said Dick.

Suddenly the abuse that Gausse had once endured as a bus boy in London flamed up and he walked through the moonlight up to Lady Caroline.

He whipped a string of condemnatory words about her, and as she turned away with a frozen laugh, he took a step after her and swiftly planted his little foot in the most celebrated of targets. Lady Caroline, taken by surprise, flung up her hands like a person shot as her sailor-clad form sprawled forward on the sidewalk.

Dick’s voice cut across her raging:“Mary, you quiet her down! Or you’ll both be in leg-irons in ten minutes!”

On the way back to the hotel old Gausse said not a word, until they passed the Juan-les-Pins Casino, still sobbing and coughing with jazz; then he sighed forth:

“I have never seen women like this sort of women. I have known many of the great courtesans of the world, and for them I have much respect often, but women like these women I have never seen before.”





11


Dick and Nicole were accustomed to go together to the barber, and have haircuts and shampoos in adjoining rooms. From Dick’s side Nicole could hear the snip of shears, the count of changes, the Voilàs and Pardons. The day after his return they went down to be shorn and washed in the perfumed breeze of the fans.

In front of the Carleton Hotel, its windows as stubbornly blank to the summer as so many cellar doors, a car passed them and Tommy Barban was in it. Nicole’s momentary glimpse of his expression, taciturn and thoughtful and, in the second of seeing her, wide-eyed and alert, disturbed her. She wanted to be going where he was going. The hour with the hair-dresser seemed one of the wasteful intervals that composed her life, another little prison. The coiffeuse in her white uniform, faintly sweating lip-rouge and cologne reminded her of many nurses.

In the next room Dick dozed under an apron and a lather of soap. The mirror in front of Nicole reflected the passage between the men’s side and the women’s, and Nicole started up at the sight of Tommy entering and wheeling sharply into the men’s shop. She knew with a flush of joy that there was going to be some sort of showdown.

She heard fragments of its beginning.

“Hello, I want to see you.”

“…serious.”

“…serious.”

“…perfectly agreeable.”

In a minute Dick came into Nicole’s booth, his expression emerging annoyed from behind the towel of his hastily rinsed face.

“Your friend has worked himself up into a state. He wants to see us together, so I agreed to have it over with. Come along!”

“But my hair—it’s half cut.”

“Never mind—come along!”

Resentfully she had the staring coiffeuse remove the towels.

Feeling messy and unadorned she followed Dick from the hotel. Outside Tommy bent over her hand.

“We’ll go to the Café des Alliés,” said Dick.

“Wherever we can be alone,” Tommy agreed.

Under the arching trees, central in summer, Dick asked:“Will you take anything, Nicole?”

“A citron pressé.”

“For me a demi,” said Tommy.

“The Blackenwite with siphon,” said Dick.

“Il n’y a plus de Blackenwite. Nous n’avons que le Johnny Walkair.”

“Ça va.”

She’s—not—wired for sound

but on the quiet

you ought to try it—

“Your wife does not love you,” said Tommy suddenly. “She loves me.”

The two men regarded each other with a curious impotence of expression. There can be little communication between men in that position, for their relation is indirect, and consists of how much each of them has possessed or will possess of the woman in question, so that their emotions pass through her divided self as through a bad telephone connection.

“Wait a minute,” Dick said. “Donnez moi du gin et du siphon.”

“Bien, Monsieur.”

“All right, go on, Tommy.”

“It’s very plain to me that your marriage to Nicole has run its course. She is through. I’ve waited five years for that to be so.”

“What does Nicole say?”

They both looked at her.

“I’ve gotten very fond of Tommy, Dick.”

He nodded.

“You don’t care for me any more,” she continued. “It’s all just habit. Things were never the same after Rosemary.”

Unattracted to this angle, Tommy broke in sharply with:

“You don’t understand Nicole. You treat her always like a patient because she was once sick.”

They were suddenly interrupted by an insistent American, of sinister aspect, vending copies of The Herald and of The Times fresh from New York.

“Got everything here, buddies,” he announced. “Been here long?”

“Cessez cela! Allez ouste!” Tommy cried and then to Dick, “Now no woman would stand such—”

“Buddies,” interrupted the American again. “You think I’m wasting my time—but lots of others don’t.” He brought a gray clipping from his purse—and Dick recognized it as he saw it. It cartooned millions of Americans pouring from liners with bags of gold. “You think I’m not going to get part of that? Well, I am. I’m just over from Nice for the Tour de France.”

As Tommy got him off with a fierce “allez-vous-en,” Dick identified him as the man who had once hailed him in the rue des Saints Anges, five years before.

“When does the Tour de France get here?” he called after him.

“Any minute now, Buddy.”

He departed at last with a cheery wave and Tommy returned to Dick.

“Elle doit avoir plus avec moi qu’avec vous.”

“Speak English! What do you mean ‘doit avoir?’ ”

“‘Doit avoir?’ Would have more happiness with me.”

“You’d be new to each other. But Nicole and I have had much happiness together, Tommy.”

“L’amour de famille,” Tommy said, scoffing.

“If you and Nicole married won’t that be ‘l’amour de famille?’ ” The increasing commotion made him break off; presently it came to a serpentine head on the promenade and a group, presently a crowd, of people sprung from hidden siestas, lined the curbstone.

Boys sprinted past on bicycles, automobiles jammed with elaborate betasselled sportsmen slid up the street, high horns tooted to announce the approach of the race, and unsuspected cooks in undershirts appeared at restaurant doors as around a bend a procession came into sight. First was a lone cyclist in a red jersey, toiling intent and confident out of the westering sun, passing to the melody of a high chattering cheer. Then three together in a harlequinade of faded color, legs caked yellow with dust and sweat, faces expressionless, eyes heavy and endlessly tired.

Tommy faced Dick, saying:“I think Nicole wants a divorce—I suppose you’ll make no obstacles?”

A troupe of fifty more swarmed after the first bicycle racers, strung out over two hundred yards; a few were smiling and self-conscious, a few obviously exhausted, most of them indifferent and weary. A retinue of small boys passed, a few defiant stragglers, a light truck carried the dupes of accident and defeat. They were back at the table. Nicole wanted Dick to take the initiative, but he seemed content to sit with his face half-shaved matching her hair half-washed.

“Isn’t it true you’re not happy with me any more?” Nicole continued.“Without me you could get to your work again—you could work better if you didn’t worry about me.”

Tommy moved impatiently.

“That is so useless. Nicole and I love each other, that’s all there is to it.”

“Well, then,” said the Doctor, “since it’s all settled, suppose we go back to the barber shop.”

Tommy wanted a row:“There are several points—”

“Nicole and I will talk things over,” said Dick equitably. “Don’t worry—I agree in principal, and Nicole and I understand each other. There’s less chance of unpleasantness if we avoid a three-cornered discussion.”

Unwillingly acknowledging Dick’s logic, Tommy was moved by an irresistible racial tendency to chisel for an advantage.

“Let it be understood that from this moment,” he said, “I stand in the position of Nicole’s protector until details can be arranged. And I shall hold you strictly accountable for any abuse of the fact that you continue to inhabit the same house.”

“I never did go in for making love to dry loins,” said Dick.

He nodded, and walked off toward the hotel with Nicole’s whitest eyes following him.

“He was fair enough,” Tommy conceded. “Darling, will we be together to-night?”

“I suppose so.”

So it had happened—and with a minimum of drama; Nicole felt outguessed, realizing that from the episode of the camphor-rub, Dick had anticipated everything. But also she felt happy and excited, and the odd little wish that she could tell Dick all about it faded quickly. But her eyes followed his figure until it became a dot and mingled with the other dots in the summer crowd.

The day before Doctor Diver left the Riviera he spent all his time with his children. He was not young any more with a lot of nice thoughts and dreams to have about himself, so he wanted to remember them well. The children had been told that this winter they would be with their aunt in London and that soon they were going to come and see him in America. Fräulein was not to be discharged without his consent.

He was glad he had given so much to the little girl—about the boy he was more uncertain—always he had been uneasy about what he had to give to the ever-climbing, ever-clinging, breast-searching young. But, when he said good-by to them, he wanted to lift their beautiful heads off their necks and hold them close for hours.

He embraced the old gardener who had made the first garden at Villa Diana six years ago; he kissed the Provençal girl who helped with the children. She had been with them for almost a decade and she fell on her knees and cried until Dick jerked her to her feet and gave her three hundred francs. Nicole was sleeping late, as had been agreed upon—he left a note for her, and one for Baby Warren who was just back from Sardinia and staying at the house. Dick took a big drink from a bottle of brandy three feet high, holding ten quarts, that some one had presented them with.

Then he decided to leave his bags by the station in Cannes and take a last look at Gausse’s Beach.

The beach was peopled with only an advance guard of children when Nicole and her sister arrived that morning. A white sun, chivied of outline by a white sky, boomed over a windless day. Waiters were putting extra ice into the bar; an American photographer from the A. P. worked with his equipment in a precarious shade and looked up quickly at every footfall descending the stone steps. At the hotel his prospective subjects slept late in darkened rooms upon their recent opiate of dawn.

When Nicole started out on the beach she saw Dick, not dressed for swimming, sitting on a rock above. She shrank back in the shadow of her dressing-tent. In a minute Baby joined her, saying:

“Dick’s still there.”

“I saw him.”

“I think he might have the delicacy to go.”

“This is his place—in a way, he discovered it. Old Gausse always says he owes everything to Dick.”

Baby looked calmly at her sister.

“We should have let him confine himself to his bicycle excursions,” she remarked. “When people are taken out of their depths they lose their heads, no matter how charming a bluff they put up.”

“Dick was a good husband to me for six years,” Nicole said. “All that time I never suffered a minute’s pain because of him, and he always did his best never to let anything hurt me.”

Baby’s lower jaw projected slightly as she said:

“That’s what he was educated for.”

The sisters sat in silence; Nicole wondering in a tired way about things; Baby considering whether or not to marry the latest candidate for her hand and money, an authenticated Hapsburg. She was not quite thinking about it. Her affairs had long shared such a sameness, that, as she dried out, they were more important for their conversational value than for themselves. Her emotions had their truest existence in the telling of them.

“Is he gone?” Nicole asked after a while. “I think his train leaves at noon.”

Baby looked.

“No. He’s moved up higher on the terrace and he’s talking to some women. Anyhow there are so many people now that he doesn’t have to see us.”

He had seen them though, as they left their pavilion, and he followed them with his eyes until they disappeared again. He sat with Mary Minghetti, drinking anisette.

“You were like you used to be the night you helped us,” she was saying, “except at the end, when you were horrid about Caroline. Why aren’t you nice like that always? You can be.”

It seemed fantastic to Dick to be in a position where Mary North could tell him about things.

“Your friends still like you, Dick. But you say awful things to people when you’ve been drinking. I’ve spent most of my time defending you this summer.”

“That remark is one of Doctor Eliot’s classics.”

“It’s true. Nobody cares whether you drink or not—” She hesitated,“even when Abe drank hardest, he never offended people like you do.”

“You’re all so dull,” he said.

“But we’re all there is!” cried Mary. “If you don’t like nice people, try the ones who aren’t nice, and see how you like that! All people want is to have a good time and if you make them unhappy you cut yourself off from nourishment.”

“Have I been nourished?” he asked.

Mary was having a good time, though she did not know it, as she had sat down with him only out of fear. Again she refused a drink and said:“Self-indulgence is back of it. Of course, after Abe you can imagine how I feel about it—since I watched the progress of a good man toward alcoholism—”

Down the steps tripped Lady Caroline Sibly-Biers with blithe theatricality.

Dick felt fine—he was already well in advance of the day; arrived at where a man should be at the end of a good dinner, yet he showed only a fine, considered, restrained interest in Mary. His eyes, for the moment clear as a child’s, asked her sympathy and stealing over him he felt the old necessity of convincing her that he was the last man in the world and she was the last woman.

…Then he would not have to look at those two other figures, a man and a woman, black and white and metallic against the sky….

“You once liked me, didn’t you?” he asked.

“Liked you—I loved you. Everybody loved you. You could’ve had anybody you wanted for the asking—”

“There has always been something between you and me.”

She bit eagerly. “Has there, Dick?”

“Always—I knew your troubles and how brave you were about them.” But the old interior laughter had begun inside him and he knew he couldn’t keep it up much longer.

“I always thought you knew a lot,” Mary said enthusiastically. “More about me than any one has ever known. Perhaps that’s why I was so afraid of you when we didn’t get along so well.”

His glance fell soft and kind upon hers, suggesting an emotion underneath; their glances married suddenly, bedded, strained together.Then, as the laughter inside of him became so loud that it seemed as if Mary must hear it, Dick switched off the light and they were back in the Riviera sun.

“I must go,” he said. As he stood up he swayed a little; he did not feel well any more—his blood raced slow. He raised his right hand and with a papal cross he blessed the beach from the high terrace. Faces turned upward from several umbrellas.

“I’m going to him.” Nicole got to her knees.

“No, you’re not,” said Tommy, pulling her down firmly. “Let well enough alone.”

Nicole kept in touch with Dick after her new marriage; there were letters on business matters, and about the children. When she said, as she often did, “I loved Dick and I’ll never forget him,” Tommy answered, “Of course not—why should you?”

Dick opened an office in Buffalo, but evidently without success. Nicole did not find what the trouble was, but she heard a few months later that he was in a little town named Batavia, N.Y., practising general medicine, and later that he was in Lockport, doing the same thing. By accident she heard more about his life there than anywhere: that he bicycled a lot, was much admired by the ladies, and always had a big stack of papers on his desk that were known to be an important treatise on some medical subject, almost in process of completion. He was considered to have fine manners and once made a good speech at a public health meeting on the subject of drugs; but he became entangled with a girl who worked in a grocery store, and he was also involved in a lawsuit about some medical question; so he left Lockport.

After that he didn’t ask for the children to be sent to America and didn’t answer when Nicole wrote asking him if he needed money. In the last letter she had from him he told her that he was practising in Geneva, N.Y., and she got the impression that he had settled down with someone to keep house for him. She looked up Geneva in an atlas and found it was in the heart of the Finger Lakes Section and considered a pleasant place. Perhaps, so she liked to think, his career was biding its time, again like Grant’s in Galena; his latest note was post-marked from Hornell, N.Y., which is some distance from Geneva and a very small town; in any case he is almost certainly in that section of the country, in one town or another.
