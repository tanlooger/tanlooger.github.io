尖利的刀锋很难躲过；

所以智者言救赎之路荆棘遍布。

——《羯陀奥义书》[1]





第一章


一


以前动笔写小说从未像今日这般顾虑重重。称之为“小说”，只是因为再也想不出别的名称。我所叙述的事情故事性不强，结局并非是“一命呜呼”或者“喜结连理”。死亡可以一了百了，通常讲故事都是以此作为收场，但“喜结连理”也是一种十分恰当的结局。遇见世俗的所谓幸福美满的大结局，奉劝那些老于世故者也不必嗤之以鼻。饮食男女嘛，本性使然，一切都尽在不言中。一男一女，不管经历怎样的水深火热，最终喜相逢，在生物功能完成之后，兴趣也就转移到未来一代的身上去了。至于事情的原委，我要给读者留一些悬念。这本书记录的是我跟一个人的陈年往事——此人和我关系亲密，但要隔很长时间才相会一次。在这段间隔期他有着什么样的经历我一无所知。如果叫我编出一些情节来加以弥补，我也可以写得天衣无缝，让故事一气贯通，可我不愿意这样做。我只打算将自己所了解的实情付诸笔端。

多年前，我写过一本小说叫《月亮与六便士》。在那本书里，我塑造的主人公的原型是个名叫保罗·高更[2]的名画家。关于这位法国艺术家的生平我知之甚少，只是依据一星半点的事实，使用小说家的特权添枝加叶编造出一些情节加以渲染。在本书里，我无意如法炮制。此处无任何虚构。书中角色的姓氏全都改过，并且采取了一些别的处理手法使之难以辨认，免得那些还活在世上的人看了尴尬。我写的这人并不出名，也许永远不会出名。也许，他的生命一旦结束，这一生留在世界上的痕迹并不比石子投入河中留在水面上的涟漪多。如此，如有读者青睐本书，完全是书中的内涵激发了读者的兴趣。不过，也许会出现另外一种情况——他选择的人生道路以及他那坚毅和温良的人格对同胞们产生了越来越强烈的影响。这样，可能在他久别人世之后，人们会醒悟到：原来在这个时代产生过一个如此出类拔萃的人物。至于我写的是何人，谜底将会昭然若揭。有些人对他早年的身世想略作了解，定会如愿以偿。我在本书中追溯那如烟的往事。书中所述可能有种种不足，但对有意为我友著书立传者尚可资用，不失为好的参考。

我并无意硬说书中对原谈话内容的记载一句不漏。在此类境况中，对于说话人的话语我从不做笔录，而只是将与我有关的事情谨记心间。虽说记载他们谈话的内容我用的是自己的词语，但我敢保证自己所言不虚。刚才我说书中无任何虚构，现在我想做一更正。就像希罗多德[3]希罗多德，公元前5世纪的古希腊作家，他把旅行中的所闻所见，以及第一波斯帝国的历史记录下来，著成《历史》一书，成为西方文学史上第一部完整流传下来的散文作品。

写这本书还有一点也叫我顾虑重重——书中的主人公基本上都是美国人。了解一个人是非常困难的事情。对于本国之人尚可以知根知底，对于其他国家的人恐怕就难以做到这一点了。了解一个人，不论男女，不但要了解其本身，也得了解其出生的环境、居住的城市公寓、学步的场所、儿时的游戏、外婆讲的故事、吃的饭菜、求学之处、从事的运动、吟咏的诗篇以及宗教信仰。这些因素深入他们的骨髓。你不可能听别人说说就算了解了他们，而非得跟他们同吃同住才能够知根知底。要做到真正了解，就得成为他们当中的一员。对于异国他乡的人，你只是一个旁观者，不可能真正了解，写书时就难取信于人了。即便亨利·詹姆斯①那般观察细致入微的人，在英国住了四十年，也没能在作品中创造出一个有着地道英国味的英国人来。至于我本人，除了在几个短篇里涉及外国人，我只专注于刻画本国人。敢于在短篇里写外国人，仅仅因为短篇里的人物不必精细描写，而只需泛泛一谈。你给读者一点粗浅的启示，细节由读者自己推想。也许有人要问，既然我能把保罗·高更塑造成一个英国人，这本书里的人物为什么不可以照做。回答是：恕难从命。照葫芦画瓢，那样的主人公就不伦不类了。我敢说，那样的主人公绝非美国人眼中的美国人，而成了英国人眼里的美国人。连他们的语言特点我都没有打算仿效。英国作家在这方面闯的乱子和美国作家打算模仿英国人说的英语时闯的乱子一样多。俚语简直就是个陷阱。亨利·詹姆斯在他的英国故事里经常要用俚语，可是总不像一个英国人说的那样地道，因此非但未能取得他所追求的俚语效果，反而弄巧成拙，时常使英国人读来感到别扭和不舒服。

一九一九年我去欧洲，途经芝加哥，为了一些与本书无关的事由在那儿待了两三个星期。当时我刚刚出版了一部小说，大获成功，一时成为新闻人物，屁股还没坐稳就有记者来采访。次日清晨电话铃便响了起来，我拿起了话筒。

“我是艾略特·邓普顿。”

“艾略特？我还以为你在巴黎呢。”

“我来这儿，是看望我姐姐的。”

“我想请你今天来，一块儿吃顿午饭。”

“乐意奉陪。”

[4]亨利·詹姆斯（1843-1916），19世纪美国继霍桑、麦尔维尔之后的著名作家。他的小说常写美国人和欧洲人之间交往的问题。

他把时间和地址告诉了我。

我认识艾略特·邓普顿已有十五个年头。此时的他年近六旬，高挑的个子，五官端正，一派儒雅的风度，乌黑浓密的卷发微染白霜，反倒使他更加气宇轩昂。他素来衣着考究，小物件可以在查维特服饰店采购，但衣帽和鞋子这套行头却一定要在伦敦添置。他在巴黎塞纳河左岸有一套公寓，位于时尚的圣纪尧姆大街。不喜欢他的人称他为掮客，这种污蔑叫他不胜愤怒。他眼光独特、学识渊博，不否认刚刚在巴黎安家的那些年曾经为有意买画的大款收藏家出过主意，助过他们一臂之力。在交际场上，他一旦耳闻某个英法破落贵族想出手一幅精品画作，碰巧又知道哪个美国博物馆的理事在访求某某大师的优秀画作，他便乐见其成，为之穿针引线。法国有许多世家，英国也是有一些的。这类人家有时深陷窘境，不得不出手某件有布尔大师①签名的柜子或者一张由齐本德尔[5]亲手制作的写字台，只要不声张出去，当然愿意有一个知识渊博、风度儒雅、办事谨慎的人代为操办。人们自然想到艾略特会从这种交易中捞上一把，但大家都是有教养的，谁也不愿明说。肚肠小的人却不客气，硬说他家样样东西都是摆出来兜售的，请美国的富佬来吃上一顿丰盛的午餐，觥筹交错之后，就会有一两幅值钱的画品不见了踪影，或者一件镶嵌细工家具被一件漆品替换。若是有人问起某样东西怎么不见了，他便头头是道地解释一通，说那东西不上品位，他拿去换了样品质远在其之上的。他还补充说，成天看一样特定的东西，哪有不烦的。

“Nous autres Américains[6]，我们美国人就喜欢换花样。这既是我们的短板，也是我们的长处。”

巴黎有些美国籍的小姐太太，自称了解他的底细，说他的家道原来很穷，之所以能过上如此阔绰的日子，只是由于他为人非常精明的缘故。

我不清楚他究竟有多少钱，可是那位有公爵身份的房东容他住这样的公寓，自然要收不菲的房租。况且，他的房间里摆的尽是值钱的物件。墙上挂着一些法国艺术大师的画作，有华多[7]的，有弗拉戈纳尔[8]的，还有克洛德·洛兰[9]等其他人的；镶木地板上铺着萨冯内里埃地毯和奥比松地毯[10]，相互争奇斗艳；客厅里摆了一套路易十五时代精工细雕的家具，制作之精，如他自己所称，说不定就是当年蓬帕杜夫人[11]香闺中的物件呢。不管怎么说，反正他不必挖空心思去赚钱，照样能把日子过得很滋润，他认为一个绅士应该讲究这种排场，至于他是如何才达到了这样的水准，智者会三缄其口，除非你希望跟他一刀两断，不再来往。对于物质生活没有了后顾之忧，他便全身心去实现一生中最大的愿望——游刃于社交圈子。初来欧洲时，他只是个拿着介绍信四处拜访名流的年轻人，后来因为帮助那些英法世家成交了几笔生意，巩固了在这之前已经取得的地位。他出身于弗吉尼亚州的一个旧世家，母系一族追溯起来，曾有一位祖先在《独立宣言》上签过字呢。他拿着介绍信拜见那些美国贵妇人时，其出身颇受重视。他如鱼得水，八面玲珑，舞跳得好，枪打得准，还打得一手好网球，什么样的派对他都是必到之客。他慷慨大方，将鲜花和昂贵的巧克力买来任意送人。他自己倒是很少请客，可是一旦设宴，必定别开生面。他会请那些阔太太到苏荷区富于人文气息的饭馆开洋荤，或者去拉丁区的酒馆小酌，使她们得到身心的愉悦。随时随地，他都愿意为人效犬马之劳，不管再怎么烦人的事，只要有求于他，他没有不乐意办的。遇见上年纪的女人，他很舍得花气力花时间曲意逢迎，没过多长时间便成了许多大户人家的新宠。他这个人太好说话了，开宴会万一有人爽约没来，请他临时凑个数，他是毫不介意的；把他安排在一个讨厌透顶的老太太身边，他一定会谈笑风生，博得老太太的欢心。

在两三年的时间里，他混迹于伦敦和巴黎，作为一个年轻的美国人，凡是能攀得上的关系，他都与之有了交往。他把家安在巴黎，社交季节之末则到伦敦去，初秋时分前往乡间去拜访一圈住在乡村别墅的名门。最初将他引入社交界的那些贵妇人发现他的交游竟然如此之广，不由颇感意外，心里五味杂陈。她们一方面感到高兴——这个受她们保护的小伙子取得了巨大的成功；另一方面，她们则有些拈酸——他跟别人混得很熟，和她们却是礼节性的交往。虽然他依然有求必应，愿意为她们效劳，但她们心里直犯嘀咕，觉得自己被他当成了跻身社交界的垫脚石，怀疑他是个唯利是图的势利眼。实际上他的确是个势利眼，一个不折不扣的势利眼，一个毫无廉耻之心的势利眼。哪家请客，他只要能上客人名单，或者跟哪个有名望的脾气乖戾的贵族老太太攀上关系，什么样的苦他都能吃，受得了侮辱谩骂，听得了冷言冷语，咽得下窝囊气。在这方面，他可以说是不屈不挠。他只要盯上一个猎物，非将其猎到手不可，就像寻找罕见种类兰花的植物学家一样执着，什么洪水、地震、热病和充满敌意的土著人啦，这种危险全不放在眼里。一九一四年的世界大战给他提供了升腾的良机。战争一爆发，他就去参加了一个救护队，先后在佛兰德斯和阿尔贡战区救死扶伤；一年后回来，他胸前多了条荣誉红丝带，并且在巴黎红十字会谋了个缺。此时的他今非昔比，手头已很宽裕，凡是名流主办的慈善事业，他必定慷慨捐赠。看见名声显赫的慈善机构，他会运用自己渊博的知识和高雅的品味鼎力相助。巴黎有两家顶级的高档俱乐部，他都成了会员。在法国那些最有名望的贵妇人眼中，他成了“了不起的艾略特”。他终于发迹了！

初次遇见艾略特时，我只是个名不见经传的年轻作家，他根本无视我的存在。由于他对每一张面孔都过目不忘，不管哪里遇见都跟我客气地握手，只是似乎毫无意图和我深交。在看戏的时候巧遇，如果他和某个显贵在一起，他就假装没看见我。后来我写的剧本获得了出人意料的成功，我立刻就察觉到艾略特对我的态度升温，变得热情起来。一天，我收到他的一封请柬，请我去克拉里奇酒店吃饭——此处是他在伦敦的下榻地。那是个小型的宴会，规格也不是很高。我当时有一种感觉，觉得他在试探我的深浅。后来，我的成功给我的身边增加了不少新朋友，跟他见面的机会也就多了起来。在这之后不久，正逢秋季，我去巴黎住了几个星期，有一次在一个双方都认识的熟人家和他不期而遇。他问了我的住址，过了一两天我就收到了他的一封午宴请柬——这次的午宴地点设在他的公寓里。到了那儿一看，我意外地发现这次宴会的规格相当高，不由心里暗自笑了。我知道他熟谙人情世故，晓得一个作家在英国社交界无足轻重，而在法国则备受推崇，于是我这个作家也就被他另眼相看了。这以后的若干年里，我和他来往十分密切，但始终未成为推心置腹的朋友。我怀疑艾略特恐怕跟任何人都不能成为朋友的。他对人并不感兴趣，只关心人的社会地位。不论我偶尔去巴黎，或是他来伦敦，他请客少一个人，或者有义务要招待前来旅游的美国人时，总要请我作陪。这些人，我怀疑有些是他的老主顾，有些是拿介绍信来拜见他的陌生人。他们成了他生活中的累赘。他觉得总得应酬一下，但又不情愿介绍他们和他那些显赫的朋友见面。打发他们最好的办法自然就是请客吃饭了，然后再请他们去看场戏，可这其中他也自有难处，因为他每晚都有应酬，而且早在三个星期前全约好了；即使他尽了地主之谊，料想那些人也未必就此满足。鉴于我是个作家，跟这类事情干系不大，于是他愿意将肚子里的苦水倒给我听。

“美国的那些人写什么介绍信，一点也不为别人考虑。我倒不是不乐意接待前来拜访的人，只是觉得实在不应该拖累身边的朋友。”

他用大篮子盛放玫瑰花，用大盒子装上巧克力，赠送给那些人以弥补招待上的不周。不过，有时还得设迎宾宴。也就是在这个时候，他请我来作陪的。先前他把原委告诉了我，此时又邀我来应景，未免有些幼稚了。

“他们渴望能和你见上一面。”他在邀请短柬中奉迎我，“某某夫人是个很有文学涵养的人，你写的书她逐词逐句都拜读了。”

见了面，那位“某某夫人”就会告诉我，说看了我的《培林先生和特雷尔先生》一书，简直喜欢极了，并祝贺我的《软体动物》剧本演出成功。殊不知头一本书的作者是休·沃波尔[12]，后一书的作者是哈伯特·亨利·戴维斯[13]。

假如我的描述让读者觉得艾略特·邓普顿是个卑鄙小人，那可就冤枉他了。

从某种意义上讲，他可以称得上法国人说的serviable。据我所知，这个词在英语词汇库里还没有完全对应的词。我查了查字典，发现该词有助人为乐、乐善好施的含意，按传统的说法就是“厚道”。艾略特正是这么一个人。他为人慷慨；虽则在早期的生涯中，那种送花、送糖、送礼的豪举无疑有他的用心，但是到后来没有这种必要时，他还是照送。赠人以物，他乐此不疲。他热情好客，所聘用的厨子能和巴黎的任何一个高厨比高低。有一点是肯定的：摆上餐桌的全都是最为可口的时令菜。他提供的酒可以证明他在这方面有很高的鉴赏力。他挑选客人看的是社会地位，而不是看客人本人如何，这是事实，可他也会至少请上一两个能说会笑的，所以他的宴会桌上几乎总是充满欢声笑语。一些人在背后嘲笑他，说他是个龌龊小人，可一旦受到他的邀请，却又会欣然接受。他讲法语字正腔圆，既流利又准确，音色很是纯正。他还曾经模仿英国人说话，使出了九牛二虎的力气，你的听力必须非常敏锐，才能听出他的英语中夹杂着一些美音。只要不以公爵和公爵夫人们为话题，他什么都说；现在即便以公爵和公爵夫人们为话题，他也放得开，敢于说些风趣的话了，特别是跟你单独在一起的时候，因为他的地位现已固若金汤。他风趣，又喜欢挖苦人，而那些高官显贵的丑闻逸事没有一件会不传到他的耳朵里来的。X公主最近产一子，其生身父亲是谁，Y侯爵的情妇是何人，这些我都是从他口中得知的。我敢断言，对于高官显贵的私生活，就连马塞尔·普鲁斯特[14]恐怕也不如艾略特·邓普顿知道的那么多。

在巴黎时，我时常跟他一起吃午饭，有时在他公寓里，有时在饭馆里。我喜欢逛古董商店，偶尔也买些，不过更多的是只看不买，而艾略特总是兴冲冲陪我一起去逛。他是个行家，真心实意地热爱艺术品。我觉得巴黎的每一家这类商店，他没有不熟悉的，并且跟每家店的老板都很熟稔。他特别爱砍价，出门前总是要叮咛我：

“你要是相中了哪样东西，先不要急着买。你只需给我使个眼色，下来就看我的了。”

我喜欢上哪样东西，他就帮着压价，最终以一半价钱成交，这会叫他高兴得不得了。看他玩这种讨价还价的游戏实在过瘾。他会争论、哄骗、发脾气、以情动人、说风凉话、挑出商品的毛病、威胁再也不迈入这家店铺的门槛、叹气、耸肩、好言相劝以及满脸怒容地朝外走，最后达到自己的理想价位之后，他还会悲哀地摇摇头，就好像他吃了败仗，只好认命一样。然后，他会压低声音用英语对我说：

“买吧。就是再多一倍的钱也还是便宜的。”

艾略特是个有激情的天主教徒。他在巴黎住下不久，就碰见一位神父。那人善于劝说异教徒皈依天主教，导引许多迷途的羊羔回到了羊圈里，因此而颇负盛名。此人饭局特多，能说会道远近闻名。他的教务活动只限于富贵人家。虽然出身寒门，却被许多大户人家尊为座上宾，艾略特见了自然便动了心思。他悄悄告诉一位在神父的劝说下皈依正教的美国阔太太，说他家里虽然一直信奉圣公会教义，而他本人却是对天主教会向往已久。一天晚上，阔太太请艾略特吃饭，跟神父见个面。饭桌旁仅有他们三人，神父说话口若悬河。女主人将话题引到天主教之上时，神父讲得天花乱坠、地涌金莲，而且丝毫不迂腐。虽则身为神父，但也是江湖上的人，对另一个江湖上的人是要说些入行的话的。艾略特发现神父竟然知道自己的来头，有点受宠若惊。

“范多姆公爵夫人那天还跟我谈起你来呢，她觉得你是个很有头脑的人。”

艾略特快活得满脸通红。公爵夫人他是拜谒过的，可是，怎么也没想到她会对他留意在心。神父心地宽广、观点入时，有着海纳百川的胸襟，一番关于天主教的议论谈得既高明又温和。根据他的高谈阔论，艾略特觉得天主教会就像个高级俱乐部，任何有教养的人如果不加入就对不起自己。六个月后，艾略特就入了教。皈依了天主教，再加上热衷于天主教的慈善事业，慷慨解囊，好多家以前对他关着的大门也被他叩开了。

他改弦更张，放弃父辈的宗教信仰，也许动机不纯，但自从皈依之后，他对天主教的虔诚之心却是无可置疑的。他每逢周日去上流社会人士经常光顾的教堂做弥撒，定期忏悔，每隔一段时间就去参拜一次罗马圣地。久而久之，教廷因他虔诚，封他做罗马教皇内侍，又见他兢兢业业、恪尽职守，奖给他一枚圣墓勋章。说实在话，他在天主教方面所取得的成功不亚于他混迹社会所获得的成果。

我时常问自己，是什么原因使得这样一个聪明、和蔼、有教养的人迷了心窍，成了一个趋炎附势者？他不是暴发户，其父在南方一个大学当过校长，祖父是名声显赫的神学家。以他的聪明机灵，决不会看不出那些应他邀请的人大多只是混一顿吃喝，有些是没脑子的，有些毫不足道。那些人响亮的头衔搞得他眼花缭乱，令他对那些人的缺点视而不见。我只能这样猜想，跟这些家世古老的绅士混个关系熟，充当贵妇人们的忠实侍卫，给他一种永不厌烦的胜利感。他的心底可能涌动着一股浪漫的激情，使得他在这些弱智的法国小公爵身上能看到当年跟随圣路易到圣地去征战的十字军战士，从外强中干、沉迷于狩猎狐狸的英国伯爵身上能看到他们侍奉亨利八世前往“金布之地”[15]的祖先。跟这些人在一起，他觉得就像生活在天地广阔、英雄气十足的古代里一样。大概他在翻阅《哥达年鉴》[16]时，心里会激情勃发，那一个又一个姓氏令他产生怀古之幽思，想到古代的战争、史册上的攻伐、外交场上的诡谲风云以及宫闱情话。艾略特·邓普顿就是这么一个性情中人。

我在洗脸、梳头，准备去赴艾略特约的饭局。就在这时，旅馆的前台打来电话，说他已到了楼下。我有点诧异，可是一收拾好，就下楼去了。

“我觉得还是我来接你更为稳妥些。”在我们握手时，他说道，“我不知道你对芝加哥熟不熟。”

我发现一些旅居海外多年的美国人都有他的这种顾虑，觉得美国是个很难走的国度，甚至可以说充满了危险，让一个欧洲人自己寻路是不安全的。

“时间还早，咱们可以走上一段路。”他提议说。

外面微有寒意，不过，万里无云，活动活动腿脚倒是不错的。

“我想还是在你会见家姐之前，先把她的情况介绍一下为好。”走在路上，艾略特说道，“她去巴黎我那儿小住过一两次。不过，你可能那时没到我那儿去过。今天人并不多，就是家姐和她的女儿伊莎贝尔以及格雷戈里·布拉巴宗。”

“就是那个室内装潢设计师吗？”我问。

“是的，家姐的房子糟得一塌糊涂，伊莎贝尔和我都劝她重新装修一下。碰巧听说布拉巴宗在芝加哥，所以我就叫家姐请他今天来吃午饭。他虽说算不上一个地道的上等人，但品味是有的。玛丽·奥利芬特的拉尼城堡以及圣厄茨家的圣克莱门特·大宝庄园都是他给装饰的。他很讨公爵夫人的欢心。你去看看路易莎家的房子就知道了。她怎么能在那儿一住就住这么多年，这叫我永远也理解不透。说到这里，我还无法理解的是，她怎么能在芝加哥住下去。”

他的姐姐布雷德利夫人是个寡妇，有三个孩子，二子一女，儿子们早已长大成家，一个在菲律宾政府里做事，另一个继承父业供职于外交界，现在布宜诺斯艾利斯。布雷德利夫人的丈夫曾经出使过若干国家，在罗马做了几年一等秘书，后来又被派到南美洲西岸的一个小共和国做公使，最终在那里死在任上。

“姐夫去世之后，我想让路易莎把芝加哥的房子卖掉，”艾略特继续滔滔不绝地说着，“可她对那房子有感情。那家人在那儿住了有些年头了。布雷德利家族在伊利诺伊州算得上是最古老的人家。他们一八三九年从弗吉尼亚原籍迁来这里，在离芝加哥大约有六十英里的地方置下田产，目前还保留着。”艾略特说到这里略作停顿，用眼睛瞧瞧我，看我有什么反应。“我想你也许会说他家早先是务农的。我不晓得你可知道，在上世纪中叶的时候，中西部开始搞开发，不少弗吉尼亚人——上等人家的子弟，受到未知世界的诱惑，抛弃了故乡衣食无忧的生活。我姐夫的父亲切斯特·布雷德利看出芝加哥有发展的前景，来这里进了一家律师事务所，反正他赚的钱也够儿辈丰衣足食的了。”

艾略特的话虽如此说，从他的神情却可以看出，那位已经去世的切斯特·布雷德利离开他祖传的华屋肥田，进了一家律师事务所，未免有点不划算，不过，幸好积攒了一笔财富，起码也算是一种补偿吧。后来有一回布雷德利夫人拿几张乡下所谓“祖屋”的照片给我看，艾略特显得有些不太高兴；照片上面我见到的是一座很不起眼的农家屋，有美丽的小花园，可是谷仓、牛棚和猪圈都隔开只有一箭之地，四周是一片荒芜的平畴。我不由想道，切斯特·布雷德利先生丢下老宅到城市里求发展，并不是没有成算的。

走了一会儿，我们叫住了一辆出租车，在一幢棕色的石头房子前下了车。房子窄而高，要攀上一串陡峭的石阶才到大门口。它处于一排房屋之间，坐落在湖滨大道旁边的一条街上，房屋外表就是在那天明媚的秋光里也还是阴沉沉的，真不明白一个人对这样的房子会有什么感情。开门的是个一头白发的黑人管家，又高又壮，他把我们引入了客厅。我们走进时，布雷德利夫人从椅子上站起来，艾略特为我做介绍。她年轻时一定是个美丽的女子，五官总体端正，一双眼睛生得煞是漂亮。可是，现在的她脸色灰黄，几乎未施任何粉黛，肌肉松弛，显然在跟中年发胖的战斗中已一败涂地。我猜她还不肯服输，因为她坐下时，腰杆在硬背椅子上挺得笔直；无疑，穿着那受罪的铠甲一般的紧身衣，这样坐在硬背椅子上要比坐在软垫椅子上舒服一些。她穿一件蓝色长衫，上面缀满了花边饰物，高领子用鲸鱼骨撑得硬硬的，一头白发烫成波浪纹，发式做得极其复杂，看上去挺有风度。另一位客人还未到，为了等他，我们就东一搭西一搭闲聊起来。

“艾略特告诉我，你是走南边那条路过来的，”布雷德利夫人说，“你在罗马歇脚没有？”

“歇了，我在那儿住了一个星期。”

“亲爱的玛格丽达王后还好吗？”

我被她这一问给问蒙了，只好回答说我不知道。

“哦，你没有去看看她？她真是一个大好人。我们在罗马的时候，布雷德利先生曾任使馆的一等秘书，她待我们好极了。你怎么就不去看望看望她呢？你跟艾略特又不一样，不至于懒得连奎里纳尔皇宫都不去一趟吧？”

“完全不是那回事。”我笑了笑说，“事实上，我并不认识她。”

“不认识？”布雷德利夫人说，那表情好像是她简直不敢相信自己的耳朵，“怎么能不认识呢？”

“实不相瞒，一般来说，作家跟国王和王后是没有过密交往的。”

“不过，玛格丽达王后是个和蔼可亲的人呀。”布雷德利夫人好言劝我，好像不认识这位王后完全是我摆架子，不屑似的，“我敢肯定你一定会喜欢她的。”

这时候门开了，管家把格雷戈里·布拉巴宗领了进来。

格雷戈里·布拉巴宗空有一个好名姓，并不是个风流倜傥的人。他五短身材，大腹便便，除掉耳朵根和后颈有一圈黑鬈发外，头秃得就像只鸡蛋，一张脸红得似猴屁股，好像时刻都会流淌下一大堆臭汗一样，两个灰色的眼珠滴溜溜乱转，嘴唇肥厚，下巴特长。他是英国人。在伦敦时，放荡不羁的文人聚会上，有时会遇见他。他是个乐天派，总是很开心，动不动就哈哈大笑。不过，即便你不善于观察人的本质，也会发现他那种嘻嘻哈哈亲密的样子只不过是一种外衣，下面遮盖的是精明的生意经。这些年来，他一直都是伦敦城里最成功的室内装潢设计师。他那洪亮的声音和又小又胖的手都极富表现力，能产生奇异的功效。他只要摆动摆动小手，再奉上一大串兴奋的字眼，就会叫一个犹豫不决的客户激动起来，极大刺激他的想象力，使得他简直没法拒绝那似乎是一份施舍的订单。

管家又走了进来，端来了一托盘的鸡尾酒。

“咱们就不等伊莎贝尔了。”布雷德利夫人拿起一杯酒说。

“她到哪儿去了？”艾略特问。

“跟拉里打高尔夫去了，说也许要晚一点回来。”

艾略特转向我说：“拉里就是劳伦斯·达雷尔。伊莎贝尔可能已跟他订婚了。”

“艾略特，我不知道你喝鸡尾酒。”我说道。

“我原本是不喝的。”他呷了一口杯中的酒说，“可在这么个禁酒的野蛮国度，你又能怎么样呢？”说着，他叹了口气，“巴黎的一些有身份的人家也开始喝这种玩意儿了。坏的世道把好的传统都给毁掉了。”

“纯粹是胡言乱语，艾略特。”布雷德利夫人说。

她的口气相当温和，然而坚决，让我听出来她是个有个性的人。她看艾略特时，神情怡然自得，我怀疑她没有将弟弟当作一个了不起的人物。我暗自寻思，她把格雷戈里·布拉巴宗归于哪一类人呢？布拉巴宗一进门先用专业的目光把屋子扫视了一圈，不由抬起了他那两道浓密的剑眉。这幢房子的确叫人称奇。壁纸、窗帘布、椅垫、椅套，全是一式的图案；墙上的油画镶在厚重的金相框里，显然是布雷德利这家人去罗马时买来的——有拉斐尔[17]派以及圭多·雷尼[18]派的圣母像，有苏卡莱利[19]派的风景画，还有帕尼尼[20]派的真迹。除此之外，屋里还摆着他们去北京时买的纪念品——精雕细刻的黑檀木桌子和景泰蓝大花瓶，也有从智利或者秘鲁买来的玩意儿——硬石刻的胖人儿和陶制花瓶。屋里的写字台是齐本德尔式的，玻璃橱亦是出自名匠之手。灯罩是用白绸做底料，上面不知是哪个没品位的画家画了几个身穿华多式服装[21]的牧童、牧女。屋子里的装饰不伦不类，但不知什么原因却叫人感到温馨。这是一种平凡却又安稳的生活气息，让你觉得这令人无法相信的杂乱之中自有一番情趣。所有这些互不协调的物件合为一个整体，成为布雷德利夫人生活的组成部分。

大家喝完鸡尾酒，门被推开，进来一个姑娘，身后跟着个小伙子。

“我们迟了没有？”她问，“我把拉里带回来了。有他的一份饭吃吗？”

“我想是有的。”布雷德利夫人笑着说，“你按下铃，叫尤金添个位子。”

“刚才是他给我们开的门。我已经告诉他了。”

“这是我的女儿伊莎贝尔，”布雷德利夫人转身向我说，“这是劳伦斯·达雷尔。”

伊莎贝尔匆匆跟我握了握手，然后将身子迫不及待地转向了布拉巴宗。

“你就是布拉巴宗先生吧？一直渴望见到你呢。你替克莱门蒂尼·多摩装饰的屋子我很是喜欢。这屋子是不是很糟糕？我好多年来都劝说妈妈，要把这儿收拾一下，现在你来芝加哥，正是我们千载难逢的好机会。请实言相告，我们家这房子究竟怎么样？”

我知道布拉巴宗绝不会直言相告的。只见他飞快地望了布雷德利夫人一眼，而后者脸上一点表情也没有，看不出任何名堂。后来他断定伊莎贝尔是拿事的人，于是就爆发出一阵响亮的笑声。

“我敢说这屋子是很舒服的，还有其他的优点。”他侃侃而谈，“不过，既然你让我直言相告，那我就说品味上糟得一塌糊涂。”

伊莎贝尔高个子、鹅蛋脸、直鼻梁，眼睛俊俏，嘴唇丰满，有着布雷德利这家人的特征。她长得很漂亮，只是有些偏胖，我想大概是由于年龄的关系，再过几年，可能就会苗条下来的。她的手结实、好看，不过也有点偏胖，就连短裙下露出的腿肚子也显得胖了些。她肤色健康，泛着红晕，这跟体育锻炼以及刚才开敞篷车回家显然不无关系。她容光焕发，活力四射，散发出蓬勃的朝气，一派顽皮快活的劲儿，流露出对生活的满足以及由衷的幸福感，让人见了为之感到高兴。不管艾略特多么儒雅，比较之下，她的那种自然纯真都会使之显得庸俗。由于她的朝气蓬勃的衬托，布雷德利夫人的那张惨白、满是皱纹的面孔显得疲惫和苍老。

我们下楼去吃饭。布拉巴宗一看见饭厅，眼睛眨巴了几下。壁上糊着暗红的普通纸，算是冒充壁纸，挂些脸色阴沉死板的男女肖像，画技不堪一提。这些人都是去世的那位布雷德利先生的近系祖先。他自己也在其中，留着浓密的小胡子，僵直的身体穿着双排扣常礼服，戴着浆硬的白领子。一幅布雷德利夫人的肖像，是九〇年代一个法国画家的手笔，挂在壁炉上方，穿一袭灰青缎子的晚礼服，颈挂珍珠链，头发上点缀一颗钻石星，一只戴满珠宝的手捏一条编织领巾（领巾画得极为细腻，连针脚都一一可辨），另一只手随随便便拿一柄鸵鸟羽扇子。屋内家具是黑橡木的，给人以压抑感。

“你觉得这东西怎么样？”大家落座后，伊莎贝尔问布拉巴宗。

“我敢说一定花了不少钱。”他答道。

“的确如此。”布雷德利夫人说，“这是我和布雷德利先生结婚时，他父亲送给我们的礼物，跟着我们跑遍了全世界——里斯本啊，北京啊，基多[22]啊，罗马啊。亲爱的玛格丽达王后非常艳羡它。”

“假如是你的，你把它怎么办？”伊莎贝尔问布拉巴宗，可是，不等后者回答，艾略特就替他说了。

“付之一炬。”他说。

接下来，三个人你一言我一语地开始讨论如何装饰这房子。艾略特力主装饰成路易十五时代的风格，伊莎贝尔则想要一张修道院里的那种餐桌和一套意大利式椅子。布拉巴宗认为齐本德尔式家具比较适合布雷德利夫人的性格。

“我一直都认为房子的装饰应该反映出一个人的性格，这是至关紧要的。”他说完，又将身子转向了艾略特。“你当然是认识奥利芬特公爵夫人的喽？”

“玛丽吗？老朋友了，熟得不能再熟。”

“她要我为她装饰饭厅，我一见她的面，就敲定用乔治二世那时候的风格。”

“真是英明决断。上次在她家的饭厅吃饭，我注意到了那儿的装饰，其品味无可挑剔。”

谈话继续进行。布雷德利夫人侧耳倾听，谁都不知道她心里在想什么。我很少开口，而伊莎贝尔的年轻朋友拉里（我忘记了他姓什么）简直一言不发。他坐在我对面的布拉巴宗和艾略特之间，我不时会看他一眼。他看上去十分年轻，和艾略特一般高，差不多六英尺，瘦瘦的，四肢显得柔软灵活，样子甜甜的，不俊也不丑，相当的腼腆，并无出众之处。我觉得有趣的是，根据我的记忆，自从进屋之后，他话没说上五六句，却显得十分自在，尽管不开口也像是在参加谈话，无不令人称奇。我注意到他的手很长，可是，就他的个头论，不能算大，形状看上去很美，同时又有力。我想画家一定高兴画这双手。他身板比较瘦，但是，看上去并不文弱，相反地，我敢说还颇具力量和韧劲。他的一张脸宁静庄重，晒得黝黑，要不是有这点黝黑，就看不出颜色来了；五官端正，但并不出众；颧骨相当高，太阳穴凹陷，深棕色的头发微微鬈曲，眼睛看上去比实际的要大，那是因为陷在眼窝里很深；睫毛浓而长，眼珠的颜色很特别，不是伊莎贝尔和她母亲、舅舅共有的那种淡褐色，而是一种深深的颜色，虹膜和瞳仁差不多是一个颜色，这给他的眼睛以一种特殊的魅力。他有一种动人的潇洒风度，从中看得出为什么伊莎贝尔对他倾心。她的眼光不时落到他身上，在那儿停留一下，从她的神情里我似乎看得出不但有情爱，而且有慈爱。二人四目相撞时，里面情意绵绵，好一幅美丽的图画。看见年轻男女彼此相爱，是极能感动人的。我，一个步入中年的人，觉得有点眼红，同时不知何故又为他们感到悲哀。若说悲哀，就蠢得没名堂了，因为我明知他们追求幸福的路上没有任何绊脚石——两家的家境似乎都宽裕，没有任何因素可以妨碍他们结婚，妨碍他们在婚后过上幸福的日子。

就重新装饰房屋这个话题，伊莎贝尔、艾略特和布拉巴宗说起来没个完，目的就是想让布雷德利夫人吐口，允许开工，可布雷德利夫人只是满脸慈祥地笑笑，硬是不吐这个口。

“不必操之过急嘛，我想静下心来好好想想。”随后，她转过头问伊莎贝尔的男友：“你是怎么看的，拉里？”

拉里向桌子四周环顾一下，眼中露出微笑。

“我觉得装修不装修都无所谓。”他说。

“你这个小坏蛋，拉里。”伊莎贝尔嚷嚷道，“我还特地关照过你，让你支持我们呢。”

“如果路易莎伯母满足于现状，为什么非得变变样呢？”

他的话说到了点子上，入情入理的，引得我不由大笑一声。拉里看了看我，也咧嘴笑了。

“别傻乎乎地笑行不行！你说的话愚蠢到家了。”伊莎贝尔说。

拉里没理会，反而笑得更厉害了。我留意到他有一口又白又小的牙齿，整整齐齐的。他望着伊莎贝尔的神情别有深意，叫她脸红起来，呼吸也急促了。假如我没有弄错的话，那她就是疯狂地在爱着他，可是不知道什么缘故，好像她对他的情意里面还有一种母爱的成分。在如此年轻的女孩身上竟然有母爱，让人意想不到。她嘴角浮出温柔的笑意，重又将注意力转向了布拉巴宗。

“别理他。他傻得不透气，一点文化也没有，什么都不懂，就知道开飞机。”

“开什么飞机？”我问。

“一战中，他是个飞行员呗。”

“我还以为他那时年纪太小，不能参战呢。”

“年纪是很小，而且不是一般的小。他调皮得不得了，逃离学校，跑到加拿大参军，撒了个弥天大谎，让人家相信他已满十八岁，混进了空军。都宣布停战了，他还在法国作战呢。”

“别说这些话了，会让伯母的客人厌烦的，伊莎贝尔。”拉里说。

“我从小就认识他，他还乡时穿一身军装，外套上挂那么多漂亮的勋章，非常英俊。我坐在他家门口的台阶上不走，缠得他一刻不得安宁，只好答应要娶我为妻。那时候，竞争可真激烈。”

“真的吗，伊莎贝尔？”她母亲说。

拉里冲着我探过了身子。

“希望你别信她的话，一句也别信。伊莎贝尔不是什么坏女孩，就是爱撒谎。”

吃完午饭不久，艾略特和我就告辞了。我先前告诉他打算去博物馆看看画，他说他带我去。我不大愿意有人跟我去逛博物馆，可推辞的话说不出口，无法说我喜欢一个人去，只好接受他的陪同。路上我们谈论起了伊莎贝尔和拉里。

“看见两个年轻人如此恩恩爱爱，怪叫人感动的。”我说道。

“他们还小，结婚还太早。”

“怎么早？趁年纪轻时恋爱、结婚，不是挺好嘛。”

“别说傻话啦。她今年十九岁，拉里也仅仅二十岁，连个工作也没有。他倒是有一笔小进项，一年三千块钱，这是路易莎告诉我的。路易莎不管从哪个方面讲都不算个富人，刚能凑合过日子。”

“哦，那他可以找个工作嘛。”

“说的是呀。可他没有这个心思。他好像很满意过这种无所事事的日子。”

“我敢说他在战争中一定吃了不少苦，也许现在想休息一下。”

“他休息已有一年了，时间够长的了。”

“我觉得他像是个很不错的孩子。”

“哦，我对他毫无成见。他的出身以及所有的一切都挺好的。他的父亲是巴尔的摩人，过去曾在耶鲁大学任教，是罗曼斯语[23]副教授。他的母亲出身于费城教友派的一个古老世家。”

“你口口声声提到过去，难道他的父母都去世了么？”

“是的，他母亲生孩子难产而死，父亲约在十二年前去世。他是他父亲的一个大学同学抚养大的，那人是马文的一个医生。路易莎跟伊莎贝尔就是这样才认识他的。”

“马文在哪儿？”

“布雷德利家的产业在那个地方，是路易莎的消夏之地。她见了那孩子，觉得挺可怜的。纳尔逊医生是个单身汉，对怎样带孩子连初步的常识都不知道。路易莎力主把这孩子送到圣保罗中学求学，每逢圣诞节便接他出来过节。”艾略特模仿法国人那样耸了一下肩膀，“我想她当初应该能预料到会有这样的结果。”

说话间，我们已走到博物馆，注意力也就转移到了绘画上。艾略特的见识和品味又令我拜服了一番。他领着我在画廊里转来转去，仿佛我是一群游客似的，讲解起那些画来，恐怕任何一个美术教授都不如他传授的知识多。我决定独自再来一次，那时自己可以由着性子转悠，自得其乐，现在先听他讲好了。过了一会儿，他看了一下表。

“咱们走吧。”他说，“在画廊里，我所待的时间从不超过一小时。一小时是一个人欣赏力所能坚持的极限。咱们改天再来看完它。”

分手时，我满口道谢。打道回府时，知识面也许扩大了一些，但我心里产生了几丝恼意。我和布雷德利夫人告别时，她告诉我第二天伊莎贝尔要请她几位年轻朋友来家里吃晚饭，饭后约好去跳舞；我要是愿意来的话，年轻人们走后，我还可以跟艾略特谈谈。

“你这等于是帮他的忙哩。”布雷德利夫人当时补充说，“他在外国待得太久了，回到这里觉得不合群，似乎找不到一个志同道合的人。”

我当即接受了她的邀请。此时在博物馆门口台阶上两人分手时，艾略特告诉我，他很高兴我答应了下来。

“在这座大城里，我就像一个迷途的幽灵。”他说道，“我答应路易莎跟她住六个星期。我们姐弟自从一九一二年后彼此就没有见过。可是，我盼着回巴黎真是归心似箭，在这里度日如年。在这个世界上，唯有巴黎适合于文明人居住。我亲爱的朋友，你知道他们这儿把我看作什么？在他们眼里我是一个怪物！这些野蛮人！”

我听后打了个哈哈，然后抽身走了。





六


次日，艾略特打电话来，说要接我去布雷德利夫人家，我回绝了他的好意，傍晚时分独自前往，也照样平安无事地抵达了目的地。出门前有客来访，稍微耽搁了一下。到达后上楼，客厅里人声嘈杂，我心想人数一定非常多，可终了意外地发现连我算上总共才十二个人。布雷德利夫人穿一身绿缎子衣服，戴一串细珠项链，显得仪态万方。艾略特穿的是无尾礼服，裁剪得体，一派儒雅的风度，大有超尘脱俗之风。跟他握手，他身上的阿拉伯香水味直朝我的鼻孔里钻。他把我介绍给一个身材稍胖的高个子，那人是个红脸膛，晚礼服穿在身上总显得别别扭扭的。此人就是纳尔逊医生，但当时我听了他的名字一点感觉也没有。其他的来客都是伊莎贝尔的朋友，那些人的名字被介绍后，我边听边忘。姑娘们个个年轻，人人漂亮，小伙子则都玉树临风。这些人除了当中的一个男孩，其他的没有给我留下任何印象——我记住了那男孩，只是因为他个头太高，身材太魁梧了。说起来，他一定有六英尺三四英寸高，生得虎背熊腰。伊莎贝尔看上去很漂亮，穿白绸上衣和拖地长裙（裙子长，正好遮住她的胖腿）；衣服颇显腰身，彰显她有着丰胸肥乳；露在外边的膀子略显肥胖，但脖颈是很可爱的。但见她情绪高昂，一双美眸闪闪发光。毫无疑问，她是个美丽、性感的年轻女子，但是看得出如果不当心的话，她会胖过头的。

吃饭时，我坐在布雷德利夫人和一位腼腆、拘谨的女孩中间——那女孩似乎是在场的人中最年轻的一个。落座后，布雷德利夫人引出了话头，说那女孩的祖父母住在马文，而她曾经和伊莎贝尔是校友。她的芳名叫索菲（这是我听到布雷德利夫人提起的唯一一个人的名字）。席间，客人们插科打诨，大家都可着嗓门说话，欢声笑语不绝于耳，人人好像都是知根知底的老熟人。我跟女主人聊天，抽个空就想跟邻座的女孩唠嗑，但是却讨个没趣——她不太爱跟人说话。论相貌她不算漂亮，可是脸蛋却很有趣味——小鼻头微翘，阔嘴，眼珠蓝里带绿。她的头发呈沙棕色，式样梳得很简单，身材消瘦，胸部几乎像男孩子一样平坦。别人开玩笑，她也跟着笑，但样子很勉强，叫人觉得她并没有真的被逗乐，开心的样子是装出来的。我猜想她在走过场，应付应付场面。不知她是天性愚钝还是过于拘谨，反正我频频兜起话头均落了个半路夭折，后来实在无话可说，就请她告诉我席间这些人都是些什么样的人。

“哦，纳尔逊医生你是认识的。”她指的是坐在布雷德利夫人对面的那个中年人，“他是拉里的监护人，是马文当地的一个医生，脑子很聪明，发明了许多飞机零件，只是没有人愿意买。无事可做的时候，他喜欢喝上一杯。”

说话时，她那浅色的眼睛里光彩熠熠，我不禁觉得她恐怕并不像我最初猜度的那般缺心眼。接下来，她把那些年轻人的名字一一告诉我，还告诉我那些人的父母是什么样的人。如果说的是男子，她就告诉我对方曾在何处上大学，现在干什么工作。她的介绍平淡无奇，或说“她很可爱”，或说“他高尔夫打得很好”。

“那个眉毛浓浓的大个子是什么人？”

“哪个？哦，那是格雷·马图林。他父亲在马文河畔有一所大房子，是我们那一带的百万富翁。我们都以他为荣，他把我们的身份都抬高了。马图林、霍布斯、雷纳和史密斯都是响当当的名字。在芝加哥，马图林是最有钱的了，而格雷是他的独生子。”

她讲到这一连串有钱人的名字时，语气戏谑、刻薄，使我不由得向她投去询问的目光，她见了脸发红，像块红布。

“马图林先生的情况，请你再仔细讲讲。”

“没有什么可讲的。他是个富翁，很受人尊敬，在马文为民众盖了一所新教堂，还捐了一百万给芝加哥大学。”

“他儿子长得很帅气。”

“他是个大好人。从他身上你绝想不到他祖父是个爱尔兰水手，祖母是瑞典人，曾在一家饭馆当服务员。”

格雷·马图林虽然并非英气逼人，却也气宇轩昂。他有着粗犷、豪放的气质，狮子鼻，嘴巴性感，肤色是爱尔兰人的那种红润色，一头浓密的黑发闪着光泽，眉毛粗重，清澈的眼睛湛蓝湛蓝的，虽则体格高大，却十分匀称，脱光衣服后暴露出来的一定是健美的身段。一看就知道他力大无穷，雄赳赳的样子给人以深刻的印象。坐在他身边的拉里虽则不过比他矮三四英寸，却比他显得文弱许多。

“崇拜他的人是很多的。”我的这位腼腆的邻座说，“据我所知，有好几个女孩子在拼命追他，就差没弄出人命了。可是她们一点指望也没有。”

“为什么？”

“你一点都不知道吗？”

“我怎么会知道。”

“他爱伊莎贝尔爱得都昏了头，而伊莎贝尔爱的却是拉里。”

“他完全可以争一下嘛，把伊莎贝尔从拉里手中夺过来。”

“拉里是他的铁哥们。”

“这样子可就麻烦了。”

“格雷是讲哥们义气的。”

我吃不准她这话的意思是当真，还是话中有话、夹枪带棒的。她的态度不卑不亢，一副不显山不露水的样子，而我产生了一种印象，觉得她既不缺幽默又不缺心眼。真不知她一边跟我说话一边在肚子里转什么心思。有一点我倒是知道的：我永远也别想摸透她。显而易见，她有点缺乏自信。我猜想她大概是个独生女，跟比她大许多的成年人在一起过着与世隔绝的日子。她在气质上贤淑静雅，倒是挺招人喜欢的。她常年过着孤独的生活——这一点如果我没猜错的话，那她一定在默默观察着成年人的一举一动，而且对他们形成了根深蒂固的看法。我们有些年纪的人很少觉察到年轻人对我们的判断是多么无情，然而又多么深刻。想到这里，我又瞧了瞧她那蓝里带绿的眼睛。

“你多大了？”我问道。

“十七岁。”

“你爱看书吗？”我唐突地冒出了这么一句。

可是，未等她回答，布雷德利夫人要尽地主之谊，跟我搭上了话头，我还没来得及摆脱，晚宴就结束了。那些年轻人转眼走得不知去向，剩下了我们四个人，就到楼上客厅里去坐。

我奇怪的是，不知他们为何要邀请我加入他们的谈话，因为闲聊了几句之后，他们便切入了一个话题——一个我认为他们一定愿意私下谈论的话题。我举棋不定，不知是不是应该知趣地起身告辞，或者作为局外人帮着出出主意。这个话题涉及的是拉里，说他看法古怪，不愿意参加工作。话题的核心点是：马图林先生（即刚才同席吃饭的那个叫格雷的男孩的父亲）答应给他一份工作，让他进马图林家的公司。这可是一个天赐的好机会。进了公司，只要能干和勤奋，拉里最终一定能挣很多的钱。小格雷·马图林一心希望他能接受这个工作。

我记不清那次谈话的具体内容了，但其主旨却清晰地印在了我的脑海里。拉里从法国返回，他的监护人纳尔逊医生劝他进大学深造，可是他拒绝了。他一时还不想忙碌起来，这也是很自然的——他毕竟在战争中吃了不少苦，还负了两次伤（虽然伤势并不严重）。纳尔逊医生认为他对战争的余悸还没有消除，休息休息直到完全恢复正常，这也在情理之中。可是，一星期又一星期过去了，一个月又一个月过去了，如今离他脱下军装已经一年多的时间过去了。他在空军里好像干得不错，回到芝加哥后成了个八面风光的人物，商界人士纷纷向他伸出橄榄枝，邀请他加盟。他先是表示感谢，继而婉言谢绝。他不解释原因，只说自己还没有拿定主意，尚不知干什么好。后来，他和伊莎贝尔订了婚。布雷德利夫人并不觉得意外，因为这两人密不可分，已相处多年，她知道伊莎贝尔深深爱着拉里。她本人也喜欢拉里，认为拉里能给女儿带来幸福。

“伊莎贝尔的个性比拉里强，可以弥补他的不足。”布雷德利夫人说。

尽管两人年纪都这么小，布雷德利夫人却愿意他们立刻结婚，不过有一个条件——拉里得先有份工作。拉里手头是有点钱的，但即便他的腰包比这鼓十倍，她还是要坚持这一原则。据我猜测，她和艾略特想从纳尔逊医生口中了解拉里的意图，并且希望纳尔逊医生运用他的影响力，劝说拉里接受马图林先生给他的职位。

“你知道我从来就管不了拉里，”纳尔逊医生说，“他小的时候就我行我素。”

“这我知道。你对他是大撒手。他没有变坏，完全是个奇迹。”布雷德利夫人说。

纳尔逊医生喝了不少酒，一听这话，白了她一眼，原本就红的脸变得更红了。

“我没空，有一屁股的事忙不完。当初我收留他，是因为他无处可去。谁叫他父亲跟我是朋友呢。他可不是个容易管教的主儿。”

“真不知你怎么能说出这种话。”布雷德利夫人尖刻地说，“他的性情是十分可爱的。”

“你叫我怎么办？这孩子从不跟你顶嘴，却想干什么照干什么。你气坏了的时候，他就说声对不起，然后就由着你发火。他要是我自己的儿子，我下得了手打他。可这么一个举目无亲的孩子，他父亲把他托给了我，心想我会善待他的，我总不能上巴掌吧？”

“你们净讲些不着边的话。”艾略特说，语气有点气呼呼的，“问题在于，他整日游手好闲，时间已经够长的了，现在有个好机会可以就业，能挣很多的钱；他如果想娶伊莎贝尔，就必须抓住这个机会。”

“必须让他知道，人活在世上就得有工作干。”布雷德利夫人插进来说，“他现在已恢复了元气，身体挺好的。大家都知道，南北战争之后，有些人回来从不做事，成了家庭的累赘，而且对社会毫无益处。”

就在这时，我开口说了话：

“那么多人邀请他去工作，都被拒绝了，那他给出的理由是什么呢？”

“无理由。他只说那些工作不合他的心意。”

“那么，他究竟想干什么样的工作呢？”

“显然没有他愿意干的。”

纳尔逊医生给自己又倒上一杯掺了苏打水的威士忌，喝了一大口，然后看看他的两个朋友。

“你们愿意不愿意听听我的拙见？我不敢说自己知人善辨，但毕竟行医三十余年，对人性也许还是略知一二的。这次战争改变了拉里。他从战场归来，已经不再是以前的他了，不仅增长了年岁，不知遇到什么事，连性格也变了。”

“遇到什么事了？”我问。

“这我无从得知。他对自己的战争经历总是讳莫如深。”纳尔逊医生说着，把脸转向了布雷德利夫人：“路易莎，他可跟你谈过他的经历？”

布雷德利夫人摇了摇头。

“没有。他初回来时，我们想让他讲讲战场上的经历，他却总是打个哈哈，说没有什么可讲的。甚至对伊莎贝尔，他也闭口不谈。伊莎贝尔不知问过多少次了，可一点名堂也没问出来。”

谈话就这么进行下去，效果不尽如人意。过了一会儿，纳尔逊医生看看表，说他必须告辞了。我准备跟他一同走，但艾略特硬把我留了下来。待纳尔逊医生走后，布雷德利夫人向我表示歉意，说拿这些私事搅扰我，恐怕我一定觉得腻味。

“不过，你从中也可以看到，这成了我的一件很大的心事。”她最后说道。

“毛姆先生为人很谨慎，路易莎，你不必担心，有什么事只管告诉他好啦。我并不觉得鲍勃·纳尔逊和拉里怎样亲密，不过，有些事路易莎和我都觉得不好开口跟他提。”

“艾略特。”

“话都说这么多了，何不将事情全都兜底讲出来。不知你吃饭时注意到格雷·马图林没有？”

“他块头那么大，谁都会注意到的。”

“他也是伊莎贝尔的一个追求者，拉里不在的时候，一直对伊莎贝尔殷勤备至。伊莎贝尔也喜欢他。假如战争再拖久一点，她很可能就嫁给他了。格雷倒是向她求过婚，她没有接受，也没有拒绝。路易莎猜她是不愿意在拉里回来之前就决定自己的终身大事。”

“格雷为什么不去参战呢？”我问。

“他因为踢足球，心脏出了点毛病，其实并没有什么大不了的，可是军队硬是不接受他。总之，拉里一回来，他就没戏了，伊莎贝尔彻底地拒绝了他的求婚。”

真是清官难断家务事。所以我没发表任何议论。艾略特却滔滔不绝地说了下去。以他那样的堂堂仪表和牛津口音，足可以当一名外交部的高级官员。

“当然，拉里是个好孩子，就他私自溜了去参加空军这件事来说也是一种了不起的壮举。不过，我看人只看实质，而且一看一个准……”他颇具深意地微微一笑，说了一句推心置腹的话——这是唯一的一句我所听到的揭示他从事艺术品交易发财诀窍的话，“如若不然，我现在就不会拥有一笔数额相当大的金边证券[24]了。依我看，拉里永远不会有大的出息，既不会有钱也不会有地位。格雷·马图林就全然不同了。他那古老的爱尔兰家族声望很好，出过一个主教、一个戏剧家，以及若干个出类拔萃的军人和学者。”

“这些情况你是怎么知道的？”我问。

“反正是该知道的时候就知道了。”他漫不经心地说，“其实，我是无意中知道的。那天在俱乐部里翻阅《名人大辞典》，看到了这个家族。”

我原本想把晚饭时我的邻座告诉我的情况和盘托出，说马图林的祖父是爱尔兰的穷水手，祖母是瑞典的一个饭馆服务员，可又觉得犯不着多事，便将话又咽了回去。只听艾略特仍在高谈阔论。

“我们认识亨利·马图林已经有好多年了。他人品好，而且非常有钱。格雷正要进芝加哥最好的一家经济行，天下的人没有不羡慕的。他想娶伊莎贝尔，替她着想，不能不说是一门很好的亲事。我自己完全赞成，而且我知道路易莎也赞成。”

“艾略特，你离开美国太久了。”布雷德利夫人说道，脸上挤出一个微笑，“你忘记了在这个国家里，女孩子并不因为她们母亲或者舅舅赞成她们的婚姻就去嫁人。”

“这种情况没有什么可以引以为自豪的，路易莎。”艾略特针锋相对地说，“根据我三十年的经验，我可以告诉你，一件婚事把地位、财产以及出身环境都考虑在内，要比爱情的结合强得多。法国算是世界上唯一的文明国家了吧。在法国，伊莎贝尔会毫不迟疑地嫁给格雷；婚后过上一两年，假如她愿意的话，可以把拉里当作她的情人；格雷呢，则可以置一所豪华公寓，养一个女明星嘛。那样会皆大欢喜。”

布雷德利夫人不痴不傻，眼睛望着自家兄弟，心里只觉得好笑。

“艾略特，问题在于，纽约剧团来演戏，待的时间有限，明星住进格雷那所豪华公寓里，能够住多久，没个定数。这会让不管哪一方都觉得心里不安宁。”

艾略特听后笑了。

“格雷可以在纽约证券交易所谋个缺嘛。在我看来，生活在美国，除了纽约，别的地方都是不能够住的。”

这以后不久我就辞别了。可是，在走之前，艾略特不知出于什么缘故，提出想请我跟他一道吃午饭，去会会马图林父子。

“若说美国的商人，亨利是最优秀的那一类了。”他说道，“你不妨跟他认识认识。他打理我们家的投资业已有许多个年头了。”

我并无结识此人的热情，可是一时又找不到推托之词，于是便答应了下来。

在芝加哥，为了消磨时光，我加入了一个俱乐部。俱乐部里有个挺不错的阅览室。赴宴的次日上午，我到阅览室想找一两本大学校刊看看——这种校刊一般只针对订阅者，平时难得一见。时间还早，阅览室里只有一个人，坐在大皮椅子上正出神地看书。我意外地发现那人竟是拉里。怎么也想不到会在这样的地方跟他不期而遇。我走近时，他抬起头来，认出是我，像是要站起来问候。

“坐着别动。”我说了一声，随后脱口问道，“你在看什么？”

“一本书。”他边说边粲然一笑——那笑容十分迷人，令他生硬的回答就完全不显得无礼了。

他把书合上，让我看不见书名，用他那简直无任何光泽的眼睛望着我。

“你昨晚玩得好吗？”我问。

“痛快极了，凌晨五点钟才回的家。”

“你这么早来这儿读书，真够刻苦的了。”

“我是这里的常客。平时的这个时候，屋子里只有我一个人。”

“我就不打搅你了。”

“你没有打搅我。”他说着又是粲然一笑。这一笑让我觉得魅力百生，绝非那种耀眼的、电光一闪的微笑，而是内心光明的展现，令他满面生辉。他坐的地方是用书架围成的一个角落，旁边还有一把椅子。他把手放在那把椅子的扶手上说：“你坐一会儿好吗？”

“好的。”

他把手里拿的书递给了我。

“我看的是这书。”

我看了看书名，原来是威廉·詹姆斯[25]写的《心理学原理》。这当然是部名著，在心理学史上占有重要位置，写得深入浅出、通俗易懂。不过，一个年轻人，一个飞行员，一个跳舞跳到凌晨五点钟的人，竟然在这儿捧读这样的一本书，就叫人意想不到了。

“为什么看这书？”我问。

“还不是因为学识太浅薄了呗。”

“你还十分年轻么。”我笑着说。

接下来，他好一会儿没有说话，我觉得局面有些尴尬，正想起身离开去找自己要读的校刊，却有一种感觉——他有话要说。只见他目光空洞地望着前方，表情庄重、专注，像是在沉思。我在等待他开口，满腹的好奇，想知道他会说些什么。他重新开始说话时，显得很连贯，仿佛中间没有出现过长时间的沉默似的。

“我从法国回来时，人人都劝我进大学深造。这我是做不到的。有了那样的人生经历，我觉得自己无法再重返校园了。在预科学校时我就没学什么东西，现在叫我上大一的课程，便是赶着鸭子上架，早晚是讨人嫌。我也不愿勉强自己做自己不想做的事。而且我不相信那些教师能教给我自己所需要的知识。”

“当然，我知道此事与我不相干，”我开口说道，“但我觉得你的想法是不对的。你的意思我想自己是理解的，也知道你打了两年的仗，现在让一个荣誉加身的中学生进大学，当一名大一大二的学生，滋味是很不好受的。至于你说自己会讨人嫌，我就不相信了。虽然我对美国的大学了解不深，但我认为美国的大学生和英国的并没有多大区别，也许只是稍微更顽皮一些，更喜欢热闹一些。总体而言，他们是些正派、懂事的孩子。我敢说，假如你不想过他们那种生活，只要稍微讲究一点策略，他们不会难为你的。我的哥哥弟弟都读过剑桥，我却没有。有过一个机会，可是我放弃了，而是一个心眼儿要到社会上闯荡。对此我一直都很后悔。当初要是上了大学，恐怕能少栽许多跟头。在有经验的大学老师指导下，学习上进步是很快的。缺乏引路人，就会糟蹋掉许多时间，盲人瞎马般乱撞。”

“也许你说得在理。但栽跟头我是不在乎的。盲人瞎马般乱撞，或许还能有所发现，找到自己的人生目标呢。”

“你的人生目标是什么？”

他迟疑了一下，然后说道：

“人生目标嘛，我也说不清道不明。”

我一时无语。对于这样的回答，你想评论似乎也是说不出什么来的。我本人少年时就有明确的人生目标，对缺乏志向的人当然会感到不耐烦的。不过，我喝止住了自己。我有个感觉，只能说是直觉：这孩子的魂魄里有一种杂乱的冲动，不知那是半明半昧的观念，还是一种隐隐约约的情绪，使得他永无宁日，刺激着他盲目地朝前冲。说来也怪，正是这样的一种东西令我顿时萌发了同情之心。此前听他说话只是只言片语，此刻始发现他的声音十分悦耳，如香膏般叫人陶醉。想想这些，再看看他那迷人的微笑和富于表情的黑眼珠，也就不难理解伊莎贝尔为什么那般爱他了。他身上的确有惹人怜爱的地方。他转过脸望着我，神态坦率，但眼睛里却有一种表情——既是挑剔，又有点玩世不恭。

“昨天晚上我们去跳舞，我想你们在背后说我了吧？”

“不错，是提到了你。”

“硬把鲍勃叔叔请来，恐怕就是因为这个理由了。他原本是很讨厌出门的。”

“好像有人给你找了一个很好的工作。”

“工作的确是很棒。”

“你打算干吗？”

“恐难从命。”

“为什么？”

“他们有心，我无意。”

我真是咸吃萝卜淡操心。不过，我有一种感觉，正是因为我来自海外，与此事无关，他才无排斥之心，愿意跟我交流交流。

“哦，你知道，一个人什么都做不了时，他就当作家。”我说完，扑哧笑了一声。

“我可没有当作家的天赋。”

“那你打算干什么呢？”

他绽出一个灿烂、迷人的微笑。

“逛大街。”他说。

我听了不由哈哈大笑。

“芝加哥恐怕不是个逛大街的好地方。”我说，“我就不打搅了。你看你的书吧，我去查阅《耶鲁季刊》。”

我起身走开了。等到我离开阅览室时，拉里还在专心致志地看威廉·詹姆斯的那本书。我独自在俱乐部里用了午餐，因为阅览室里安静，又回到那里去抽雪茄，在那儿消磨了一两个小时，看看书、写写信什么的。叫我感到诧异的是，拉里仍在聚精会神地看书，好像自打我走开后他一直就没有挪过窝。四点钟左右我走出阅览室，他还在老地方。显然，他有着很强的定力，叫我感到很是惊讶。我或来或走，他全然不加留意。下午，我因琐事缠身，直到应当换衣服去赴晚宴时，才回黑石旅馆。回旅馆的路上，我突发好奇之心，于是又去了一趟俱乐部，拐进了阅览室。此时，阅览室里已经有不少人在看报读书什么的。拉里竟然还坐在那张椅子上，还在全神贯注地看那本书！这不能不叫人称奇！





八


次日，艾略特请我去帕尔玛饭店共进午餐，同时会见马图林父子。这一席总共四人。亨利·马图林也是个大块头，差不多和他儿子一样魁梧，一张肉乎乎的红脸，大下巴，也有着一个咄咄逼人的狮子鼻，但眼睛却比儿子的小，也不如儿子的那样蓝，露出几分刁钻诡诈。论年岁，他也只不过五十开外，面相却老上十岁，头发稀得很厉害，白如霜染；初看上去，并不给人好感。看他的气派，好像这些年头混得挺不错。他给我留下的印象是一个残酷、精明、能干的人，这种人在生意场上是绝不会讲情面的。起初，他少言寡语的，我觉得他在打量我。我一眼就看得出，艾略特在他的眼中只是个可笑的人。格雷温和可亲、彬彬有礼，几乎一句话不说，如若不是艾略特交际手腕老到，滔滔不绝扯些闲话，局面一定会很僵的。我猜他过去和那些中西部商人做交易，积累了不少经验——那些人不用甜言蜜语哄着，是不会花那样惊人的价钱买一张古旧名画的。过了一会儿，马图林先生渐渐放松了下来，吐出了几句话语，这才显出他并不似表面那样严峻，而且的确还有点干巴巴的幽默感。席间有那么一会儿，话题转到了股票证券上。艾略特口若悬河，显得知识极为渊博，这一点也不叫人惊奇，因为我一向知道他虽然处事荒唐可笑，在这方面却绝非饭桶。

就在这时候，只听马图林先生说道：

“今天上午我收到格雷的朋友拉里·达雷尔写的一封信。”

“没听你讲起过呀，爸爸。”格雷说。

马图林先生转向我问：

“你认识拉里吧？”

我点点头。

“格雷做过我的工作，让我在公司里给他安排一个位置。他们是好朋友。格雷对他极为上心。”

“他是怎么说的，爸爸？”

“他向我表示感谢，说这对一个年轻人而言是千载难逢的好机会。他认真做了一番思考，最后觉得一定会辜负我的栽培，还不如最初就不接受的好。”

“简直愚蠢之极。”艾略特说。

“是这样的。”马图林先生说。

“太让人遗憾了，爸爸。”格雷说，“如果我们俩能在一起工作，那该多好呀。”

“强扭的瓜不甜呀。”

马图林先生说这话时看着儿子，那双诡诈的眼睛顿时变得温柔起来。我这才看出这位寡情的商人还有另外的一面——他对自己的那个大块头儿子有着极深的舐犊之情。随后，他将目光又一次转向了我。

“你知道这孩子星期天在场子上打了两盘标杆赛，赢了我七杆和六杆。我真该用球棒揍他一顿。想起来，他打高尔夫球，还是我一手教会的呢。”

他的表情很为儿子感到自豪，叫我开始对他有了好感。

“我只不过是运气好嘛，爸爸。”

“根本不是那回事。你把球从沙坑里打出来，落下来离洞口只有六英寸远，难道凭的是运气不成？那一杆打了三十五码远，一英寸也不会少。明年我还想叫他去参加业余锦标赛呢。”

“我恐怕抽不出时间来。”

“我是你的老板，难道不是吗？”

“我可知道你的厉害！我上班哪怕迟到一分钟，你也会暴跳如雷的。”

马图林先生扑哧一声笑了。

“看这小子把我描绘成了个专制霸王了。”他对我说道，“别信他的话。公司靠我撑着呢，我的合伙人都不行。我为自己的业绩感到自豪。我叫这孩子从底层干起，希望他跟其他的年轻员工一样一步一个脚印地干上去，一旦需要他继承我的事业时，他也就成熟了。像我的这个公司规模，可是千斤重担呢。我为有些客户打理投资业务，有长达三十年的历史了，他们对我是信任的。实不相瞒，哪怕是我自己赔钱，也不愿看客户折本。”

格雷笑了。

“那天，有个老姑娘来找他，想投资一个风险很大的项目，说是牧师建议她这么做的，他拒绝为她办理。老姑娘认死理，惹得他发了一顿脾气，结果老姑娘哭着走了。后来他又跑去找那个牧师，将牧师也训了一通。”

“别人谈论起我们经纪人，总把我们说的一无是处，殊不知经纪人也有好坏之分呢。对客户，我不想让他们折本，只想叫他们赚钱。大多数客户不领情，看他们那做派，就好像人生只有一个目标——散漫使钱，非得将钱折腾光不可。”

饭后，马图林父子辞别，回公司去了。我和艾略特离开饭店时，他突然问我：“你怎么看马图林先生？”

“我一向喜欢结交各种不同类型的人。我觉得他们父子之间感情深厚，令人感动。想来这在英国是不多见的。”

“他对儿子宠爱得不得了。他的性格的确有点古怪。他评论自己客户的那席话倒是句句真实。他的客户有好几百，都是些老太婆、退伍军人和牧师，把手里的积蓄交给他搞投资。那些人麻烦得很，我觉得为他们打理生意很划不来。可他极为看重那些人对他的信任。不过，遇到大生意，有厚利可图，他就会翻脸不认人，谁都不如他心狠手辣。这时的他是一点情面都不讲的。他要想从你身上割一磅肉，那他会不达目的誓不罢休。你要是跟他对着干，他会叫你倾家荡产，非整倒你而后快。”

回到家，艾略特对布雷德利夫人直言相告，说拉里拒绝了亨利·马图林给他的机会。伊莎贝尔正跟闺密们共进午餐，走进来时，姐弟还谈着这件事。他们将结果告诉了她。后来，艾略特把这次谈话的情况讲给我听，我觉得他把一番大道理说得头头是道。虽然他自己没有干什么艰苦的活儿，他用以发家致富的工作一点辛苦的味儿也没有，他却坚定地认为经营实业乃国之本。拉里只不过是个普普通通的青年，又没有社会背景，没有理由不按照国之常情办事。在艾略特这样有眼光的人看来，美国显然正在步入一个空前的繁荣时代。拉里现在有个入门的机会，只要他脚踏实地撒手干，到了不惑之年也许能挣几百万。那时候，他要是愿意歇手，过过上等人的日子，完全可以当个寓公，在巴黎的杜波依斯大道买一套公寓，或者在都兰购一幢别墅，他艾略特将无话可说。这时，布雷德利夫人冲着女儿说的一句话更为直截了当，叫伊莎贝尔难以回答：

“他要是爱你的话，为了你，他也应该出去工作。”

伊莎贝尔具体是怎么回应的，我无从得知。这姑娘胸藏锦绣，情知大人的话不无道理。她认识的小伙子们都有了出路，或学习深造，或进哪个行当实干，或进公司经商。拉里虽在空军有过辉煌的业绩，但也不能指望着吃一辈子呀。战争硝烟已散，人人都对战争深恶痛绝，恨不能赶快忘掉战争的创伤。经过一番讨论，伊莎贝尔答应跟拉里摊牌，把事情来个彻底了断。布雷德利夫人献计：伊莎贝尔可以求拉里开车送她去马文，就说她在给客厅定制新窗帘，一张量好的尺寸单被她丢掉，所以要叫伊莎贝尔再去量一下。

“鲍勃·纳尔逊会留你吃午饭的。”她说。

“我有个更好的主意。”艾略特说，“不如准备个午餐篮，就在门廊那儿吃，吃完好说事儿。”

“这样倒是怪有趣的。”

“自自在在来一顿野餐，是天下最美的享受了。”艾略特不失时机地补充说，“泽斯公爵老夫人曾私下对我说，再怎么执拗的男子，到了这种场合也会变得温顺服帖。路易莎，你打算给他们准备什么样的午餐？”

“煮鸡蛋和鸡肉三明治。”

“净胡来。野餐嘛，哪能没有肥鹅肝酱饼。头一道菜应该是咖喱虾仁，再下来就是鸡脯肉冻，配上生菜心沙拉，沙拉的调料由我来配制。有了肥鹅肝酱饼，如果愿意的话，可以按你们美国人的习惯，准备上一个苹果派。”

“我只给他们准备煮鸡蛋和鸡肉三明治，艾略特。”布雷德利夫人斩钉截铁地说。

“那你记住我的话：此事一定会泡汤，怪只能怪你自己。”

“拉里的胃口非常小，舅舅，”伊莎贝尔说，“而且吃进肚子里的是什么他从不注意。”

“但愿你不要把这当作他的优点，傻孩子。”做舅舅的回了一句。

至于那次野餐，布雷德利夫人硬是坚持家里有什么就让他们吃什么。事情过后，艾略特告诉我结果时，法国味十分浓地耸了耸肩膀。

“我早就有言在先，说事情会泡汤的。我战前送给路易莎一瓶蒙哈榭白葡萄酒，这次求她放进野餐篮，可是她充耳不闻。伊莎贝尔他们只用热水瓶灌了些咖啡，其他一点酒水都没有。你还能指望有什么好结果呢！”

据说，伊莎贝尔回家时，路易莎·布雷德利和艾略特正坐在客厅里。汽车吱扭一声停在大门前，伊莎贝尔走了进来。天擦黑，窗帘已拉上。艾略特懒散地坐在扶手椅上，在炉边看一本小说。布雷德利夫人在绣一块帷帘，是要当作防火屏风[26]用的。伊莎贝尔没有来客厅，而是直接回楼上她的房间去了。艾略特抬起头，目光从眼镜的上方望了望姐姐。

“我想她脱掉帽子，用不了一分钟就会下来的。”做姐姐的说。

可是伊莎贝尔没有下来，好几分钟过去了也没下来。

“可能是累了，躺在床上休息呢。”

“你难道没想到，拉里应该进来坐坐吗？”

“别说叫人生气的话，艾略特。”

“好吧，反正这是你家的事，我这是狗拿耗子多管闲事。”

说完，他又继续看他的书了。布雷德利夫人继续刺绣屏风。但半个小时后，布雷德利夫人坐不住了，突然站了起来。

“我想，还是上去看看她怎样了吧。假如休息了，我就不惊动她了。”

她离开客厅上楼去，可没过多大一会儿就又下来了。

“她哭了一场。拉里要到巴黎去，两年内回不来。她答应等他。”

“他为什么要到巴黎去？”

“问我没有用，艾略特，我无从得知。她什么都不肯告诉我。她说她理解拉里，不愿当他的绊脚石。我跟她说：‘他一别就是两年，证明他爱你爱得不十分深。’她说：‘我也没有办法。问题在于我爱他爱得十分深。’我说：‘有了今天的变化，你对他的爱还十分深吗？’她说：‘今天的变化反而叫我比以往任何时候都更加爱他了。他也爱我，对这一点我坚信不疑。’”

艾略特细细思索了一会儿。

“两年之后会出现什么情况呢？”

“我哪能知道，艾略特。”

“你不觉得这样的结局让人十分扫兴吗？”

“的确叫人十分扫兴。”

“没什么可讲的了，只能说他们还很年轻，等上两年也无妨。在这两年当中，什么事都可能发生。”

姐弟俩达成一致，最好不要去打搅伊莎贝尔。一家人原打算出去吃晚饭，于此只好作罢。

“我可不想让她听了别人的议论而感到难过。”布雷德利夫人说道，“那些人见她哭肿了眼泡，肯定会感到好奇的。”

第二天，他们在家里吃午饭，饭后布雷德利夫人旧话重提，把那件事又摆在了桌面上，可还是从伊莎贝尔嘴里问不出话来。

“能告诉你的都告诉你了，妈妈，实在没有什么可讲的了。”伊莎贝尔说。

“我问你，他到巴黎究竟想去干什么？”

伊莎贝尔微微一笑，因为她知道自己接下来的回答一定会叫母亲感到不可思议。

“他要去逛大街。”她说道。

“逛大街？这是什么鬼话？”

“他就是这么说的。”

“我真是受不了你。你要是有点骨气的话，就应该跟他一刀两断。这不明明在耍你嘛。”

伊莎贝尔看了看戴在左手上的订婚戒指，然后说道：

“我有什么办法呢？我爱他。”

后来，艾略特也加入了母女的谈话。他运用娴熟的说话技巧掺和了进去。“我可没有摆舅舅的谱，亲爱的伙计，而是作为一个通晓世情的人跟一个毫无社会经验的女孩对话。”他对我解释道。可是，他所达到的效果并不比他的姐姐强。伊莎贝尔好像叫他别管闲事，语气当然是很客气的，说得却是掷地有声。就在当天晚一些的时候，艾略特来到黑石旅馆，在我的小客厅里将事情的来龙去脉一五一十告诉了我。

“当然，路易莎是完全正确的。”他最后补充道，“此事弄得人非常窝火。男女青年仅仅是相互爱慕，除此之外什么也不懂，让他们决定自己的婚姻，这种结果是避免不了的。我叫路易莎不必为此愁肠百结，也许会有柳暗花明那一天呢。拉里走了，格雷·马图林还在嘛……如果我对自己的国人看法没错的话，结局是很明显的。十八岁的年轻人感情炽热如火，但长久不了。”

“你真是熟谙世态炎凉呀，艾略特。”我笑了笑说。

“我读拉罗什富科[27]的书，总算没有白读。你知道芝加哥社会是个小圈子。他们天天见面。女孩子家，有个男子死心塌地爱她，肯定会芳心大悦。她要是知道自己的闺密无一不心甘情愿地想嫁给这个男子，那你想想，她是不是出于人的本能也会拼一拼、争一争宠呢？这情形犹如去参加一个宴会——你明明知道去了会无聊得不行，吃的东西也只有柠檬水和饼干，然而你还是去了，因为你知道自己最好的朋友们打破头都想去，却没有受到邀请。”

“拉里何时启程？”

“不知道。行程可能还没有决定呢。”艾略特说着从口袋里掏出一个长方形的薄薄的镶金铂质烟盒，取出一支埃及烟。对于法蒂玛牌、契斯特菲尔德牌和骆驼牌那样的香烟，他是瞧不上眼的。他笑眯眯地用眼睛瞅着我，笑容含蓄，别有深意。“有些话不便讲给路易莎听，不过可以告诉你：对于那个小伙子，我暗藏同情之心。战争期间，他可能目睹了巴黎的风采。他要是被这个天下唯一适合于文明人居住的城市迷了心窍，那我一点都不感到奇怪。他年纪轻，无疑是想在结婚过小日子之前，纵情风流一把。这很正常，也很自然。我要照拂他的，引荐他认识应该认识的人。论风度，他还是能上得了席面的，稍加指点，便可以出入社交场合了。我保证能叫他看到真正的法兰西生活——能有这种机会的美国人少之又少。老伙计，请相信我的话：普通的美国人要进入圣日尔曼大道[28]，真比登天还难。他二十岁，魅力还是有的。我可以做出安排，让他跟一个年纪大一些的女人建立联系，这对他的成长大有裨益。我总觉得，一个年轻男子给一个有些岁数的女人当情郎，本身就是一种最好的教育方式。当然，我所说的女人必须是社交名媛[29]，这会叫他一步登天，步入巴黎上流社会。”

“你把这锦囊妙计告诉布雷德利夫人了吗？”我微笑着问。

艾略特嘿嘿嘿地笑了。

“我的老伙计，假如我有值得自豪之处，那就是我的处世方针。我没有告诉她，就是说出来，她也不会理解的。可怜的路易莎！她有许多地方叫我永远也吃不透，而这就是其中的一点。她半辈子都生活在外交界，世界上有一半国家的首都她都待过，可骨头缝里仍然是一个死脑筋的美国人。”

那天晚上，我到湖滨大道上的一所偌大的石头屋赴宴。看那房屋，好像建筑师当初打算盖一座中世纪城堡，后来中途改变主意，决定建成一幢瑞士风格的山地农舍式房子。宴会的规模很大。走进宽敞、奢华的客厅时，满眼都是雕像、棕榈树、枝形吊灯、古画，以及散布各处的家具。令我高兴的是，来宾中至少有几位是熟人。亨利·马图林给我介绍了他的老婆——一个骨瘦如柴、弱不禁风、脸上涂脂抹粉的女人。我向她问了声好，也向同在跟前的伊莎贝尔打了个招呼。伊莎贝尔穿一身红绸衣裙，和她那浓栗色头发、深褐色眼睛很相配，显得光彩照人。她看上去兴致很高，谁也猜想不到她最近在情感上刚有过一段痛苦的经历。两三个小伙子，其中包括格雷，众星捧月般围着她，而她满脸喜色地与之谈笑。吃饭时她和我不同桌，看不见她。饭后，我们男客消消停停地喝咖啡、呷酒、抽雪茄，过了许久才回到客厅里。在这儿，我有了跟她说话的机会。按说，我和她不熟，不便开门见山，将艾略特给我说的话直接端出来，可又觉得应该说些什么，也许她还乐得一听呢。

“那天在俱乐部里我看见你的男友了。”我以漫不经心的语气说道。

“哦，是吗？”

她说话时也同样漫不经心，但我发现她竖起了耳朵，注意力立刻集中了起来，眼睛在观察着我，里面似乎能看得到几分忧虑。

“他在阅览室里看书，聚精会神的，那种专注的劲儿给我留下了十分深刻的印象。十点钟刚过的时候我去阅览室，他在看书；吃过午饭后我回到那儿，他还在看书；饭馆里吃过晚饭后回家，我拐回去瞧了瞧，他仍在看书。我敢说他在椅子上足足坐了有十个小时没挪过地方。”

“他看的是什么书？”

“威廉·詹姆斯的《心理学原理》。”

她听后垂下了眼皮，我无从得知自己的一席话在她的心里激起了什么样的反应，但我隐约感到她好像既困惑不解，又松了口气。这时，主人跑来拉我去打桥牌，等到牌局散时，伊莎贝尔和她母亲已经走了。





十


过了两三天，我去向布雷德利夫人和艾略特辞行，碰到他们正在喝茶。不大一会儿，伊莎贝尔也走了进来。接下来，大家以我的行程为题目交谈了几句。随后，我对他们表示感谢，感谢他们对我在芝加哥逗留期间盛情的招待。就这么坐了不长不短的一段时间，我便起身告辞了。

“我陪你走到药店那儿，”伊莎贝尔说，“我刚想起有点东西要买。”

分别时，布雷德利夫人对我说的最后一句话是：“你下次看见亲爱的玛格丽达王后时，替我向她表示敬意，好吗？”

这次，我没有否认自己认识那位高贵的夫人，而是爽快地答应一定做到。

我和伊莎贝尔来到大街上，她笑吟吟地用眼角的余光看了看我。

“去喝一杯冰淇淋苏打水，能喝得惯吗？”她问我。

“喝喝看吧。”我想了想说。

一路上，伊莎贝尔再也没说话，我肚子里没有话，也就沉默着。到了药店走进去，我们捡一张桌子坐下，椅背和椅子腿都用铁条扭成，坐着怪不舒服的。我点了两杯冰淇淋苏打水。柜台那儿有几个人在买东西；别的桌子旁坐着两三对客人，但都忙着谈自己的事情。总之，没人注意到我们俩。我点起一支香烟等着伊莎贝尔说话，而她用一根长吸管喝着苏打水，样子不急不忙的。我却有一种感觉——她的内心并不安宁。

“我是想跟你谈谈心里话。”她猛然来了这么一句。

“我猜到是这回事。”我笑盈盈地说。

她若有所思地望着我，有那么一会儿工夫。

“前天晚上在萨特思韦特家，你为什么那样说拉里？”

“我觉得你关心他的情况。在我看来，你恐怕没有真正理解他所说的‘逛大街’的含意。”

“艾略特舅舅的嘴很碎。那天他说要上黑石旅馆找你谈谈，我就知道他要把所有的事情都告诉你的。”

“你也知道，我认识他许多年了。议论起别人的事情，他就津津有味的。”

“的确如此。”她笑了笑说。但那笑意一闪便消失了。随后，她直直地看着我，目光严肃认真。“你怎么看拉里？”

“我只见过他三次，觉得他像是个非常不错的小伙子。”

“就这么些吗？”

她的声音流露出一丝忧伤。

“不，不仅仅如此。三言两语很难说得清，也可能是我对他了解太少了。当然，他很讨人喜欢。他身上有一种谦虚、友好、温柔的东西，十分吸引人。他这么年轻，却如此有主见，跟我在这里见到的所有的小伙子都不一样。”

我搜索枯肠，找着字眼想把心中并不怎么清晰的印象讲出来，而伊莎贝尔看着我，目光专注。待我讲完，她轻轻舒了口气，仿佛是吊在嗓子眼的心落了地，然后抛给我一个微笑，迷人，还带点顽皮。

“艾略特舅舅说他时常对你的观察力感到诧异。他说什么都逃不过你的眼睛，但你作为一个作家，最大的长处则是你的判断力。”

“我看还有比这更为珍贵的呢，”我干巴巴地说，“例如才气就是其中的一种。”

“你知道我的情况——苦于找不到人商量此事。妈妈只从她自己的角度看问题。她只想让我将来过上衣食无忧的日子。”

“这很自然，可怜天下父母心。”

“艾略特舅舅只看社会地位。我自己的朋友——那些和我年龄相仿的人，认为拉里没有出息。这使我很难受。”

“当然的喽。”

“并不是说他们待他不好。谁也不可能对拉里不好。可是，他们看不起他，拿他当笑柄，老是取笑他。他却不愠不恼，只是付之一笑，让那些人感到老大没趣。事情的现状你知道吗？”

“只是听艾略特说了些。”

“我们那天去了一趟马文。我把当天发生的事情讲给你听好吗？”

“当然好了。”

我对那天的情况做如下描述，一部分根据的是对伊莎贝尔说话内容的回忆，一部分则是我想象出来的。不过，她和拉里的谈话是一次长谈，内容肯定要比我在此处陈述的丰富得多。依我看，遇到这种事情，谈话人不仅会扯些风马牛不相及的话头，还会把一些话重复来重复去的……

话说伊莎贝尔那天早晨醒来，见天气晴好，便打电话给拉里，说她母亲有点事情要她到马文去一趟，求他开汽车送她去。除了她母亲关照尤金准备的一热水瓶咖啡外，她还特地把一瓶马丁尼酒放进了野餐篮子。拉里的车是辆跑车，是才买来的，他颇为此而感到自豪。他开车风驰电掣，那速度叫二人都觉得痛快极了。抵达了目的地，伊莎贝尔给需要调换的窗帘量了尺寸，拉里用笔记了下来。随后，他俩来到门廊，将午餐摆上。这儿避风，任何一个方向的风都吹不到此处，却沐浴着小阳春的阳光，令人感到舒服惬意。这幢房子位于一条土路边，跟新英格兰那些古香古色的木屋比起来，缺乏的是雅致，顶多只能说得上宽敞舒适，可是从门廊上望出去的景色却还悦目——一座红色的大谷仓，黑屋顶；一丛老树；再过去是一片一眼望不到头的褐色田野。景色是单调的，可是，阳光和深秋的温暖色调在那一天却给眼前的景色平添一种亲切和温馨的气氛。展现在面前的那片寥廓里，洋溢着欢乐。冬天这里一定寒冷荒凉，夏天可能炎热蒸人，然而在这个季节却使人感到异常兴奋，因为开阔的景色撩人，使人内心里产生出冲动。

他们俩跟所有青年男女一样，在一块儿吃饭吃得很开心。二人能够单独相处，不胜欢喜。伊莎贝尔把咖啡斟好，拉里点上了烟斗。

“现在你可以打开天窗说亮话了，亲爱的。”拉里说道，眼睛里带着一丝开心的笑意。

伊莎贝尔被说得一愣。

“说什么亮话呀？”她问道，故作一副不明就里的样子。

拉里呵呵笑了。

“亲爱的，你难道把我当作大傻瓜不成？你母亲要是不知道客厅里窗帘的尺寸，我就把脑袋输给你。你要我开车子送你来这里，恐怕另有他因。”

伊莎贝尔恢复了镇静，给了他一个千娇百媚的微笑。

“原因嘛，是我觉得咱俩在一起待上一天比什么都强。”

“话可以这么说，但我觉得事实并非如此。依我看，是艾略特舅舅把实情告诉了你——我谢绝了亨利·马图林的好意，不愿接受他给我的工作。”

他说话时语调轻松愉快，伊莎贝尔觉得用这种口吻谈下去倒也有利于交流看法。

“格雷一定会大失所望的。能跟你在一个办公室上班，在他看来是天大的一件美事。你总有一天要找个工作做的，时间拖得越久，就越难找。”

他抽了一口烟斗，望着她，温情地笑着。她摸不着头脑，不知他葫芦里卖的是什么药。

“我有一种想法——此生想有所作为，而不仅仅局限于经营股票生意。”

“那么好吧。那你进律师事务所工作，或者去学医。”

“不，这两件事我都不想做。”

“那么，你想做什么呢？”

“逛大街。”他一本正经地回答。

“天呀，拉里，别说俏皮话了。这是件严肃认真的事情。”

她声音颤抖，眼睛泪水汪汪。

“别哭呀，亲爱的。我可不想惹你难过。”

他走过来，挨着她坐下，用胳臂搂住她。他的声音里有一种柔情，深深打动了她，于是泪水似决堤般滚滚而下。可她马上又擦干眼泪，破涕为笑，让一丝笑意浮现在嘴角。

“不想惹我难过，那是漂亮话。其实你已经在让我难过了。你知道，我是爱你的。”

“我也爱你，伊莎贝尔。”

她发出深深的一声叹息，然后从他怀里挣脱出来，把身子挪开了一些。

“识时务者为俊杰。人生在世，总得干活呀，拉里。这是一个有关于自尊的问题。咱们的国家很年轻，需要每个人都参加它的建设活动。亨利·马图林那天说，咱们正在进入一个新纪元，将会取得辉煌的成就，让人类以前所有的作为都相形见绌。他说咱们国家的成就将会是无可估量的。他坚信到了一九三〇年，我国将成为世界上最富强、最伟大的国家。你不觉得这非常振奋人心吗？”

“的确非常振奋人心。”

“对一个年轻人而言，这是个千载难逢的好机会。依我看来，你一定会为能够参加这项事业而感到自豪的。这可是一项改天换地的事业。”

他听了淡然一笑。

“我敢说你是对的。阿穆尔-斯威夫特公司将会做出更多更好的肉罐头，麦考密克公司将会造出更多更好的收割机，亨利·福特将会造出更多更好的汽车。每个人的钱包都会变得越来越鼓。”

“这不挺好吗？”

“正如你所言，这是挺好的，只是我对钱不感兴趣。”

伊莎贝尔咯咯咯地笑了。

“亲爱的，别说傻话。没有钱是活不下去的。”

“我手里是有一点钱的。这点本钱能让我按自己的意愿去行事。”

“逛大街吗？”

“是的。”他笑嘻嘻地说。

“你这是叫我为难呀，拉里。”她叹了口气说。

“很抱歉。要是有办法，我也是不愿叫你为难的。”

“你应该是有办法的。”

他摇了摇头，由于想心事，半天没吱声。等到他最后开口时，说出的话吓了伊莎贝尔一大跳：

“人死如灯灭。死了，一了百了。”

“你这话究竟是什么意思？”她不无担忧地问。

“就是这个意思。”他冲着她苦笑了一下说，“当你独自在天上飞行时，会有许多的时间思考人生，会产生一些离奇古怪的想法。”

“什么样的想法？”

“模糊、杂乱、不连贯的想法。”他笑了笑说。

伊莎贝尔想了想，然后说道：

“先找个工作干，也许就能理清头绪，从而使心情安定下来，你不觉得这是上策吗？”

“对于何去何从，我也做过一番思考。我想到过去当木匠或者汽车修理工。”

“天呀，拉里，人家会以为你疯了呢。”

“别人怎么说，有什么关系呢？”

“对我而言是有关系的。”

说到这里，二人又沉默了下来。后来，伊莎贝尔打破了沉默。只听她叹了口气说：

“跟去法国参战之前相比，你像是变了个人似的。”

“这并不奇怪。要知道，我在那儿经历了许多的事情。”

“什么事？”

“哎，说起来也只是些战场上经常发生的事情。我在空军有个最好的朋友，为了救我，他壮烈牺牲了。此事叫我怎么也难以忘怀。”

“给我讲讲，拉里。”

他看了看她，露出十分痛苦的眼神。

“还是不讲的好。说到底，这在战场上只是件小事。”

伊莎贝尔本来就容易动感情，此时早已泪水涟涟。

“你为此而感到纠结了吧，亲爱的？”

“没什么。”他笑吟吟地回答道，“要是惹你不高兴，这才会叫我纠结呢。”他拉起她的手——他那坚实有力的手使她感受到了友谊和亲密无间的感情。她咬紧嘴唇，不让自己哭出声来。“除非找到了生活的目标，否则我的一颗心恐怕永无宁日。”他表情沉重地说。之后，他停了停，才又说道：“这种心情很难用语言表达，想说也说不出口。我会在心里自责，千不该万不该，不该为过去的事情而痛苦，从而殃及别人。也许，怪只怪我自己是个顽固不化的人。我会问自己：走别人所走的路，随遇而安，是不是更好些呢？就在这时，我的脑海里会出现一个人，刚刚还生机勃勃，转眼便命赴阴间。生活就是如此残酷，如此缺乏意义。你不禁要问：人生的意义在哪里？人生的价值在哪里？难道人生是一种愚蠢的、盲目的、悲惨的过程吗？”

讲述时，拉里的声音异常悦耳，说说停停的，就好像是在强迫自己说出本不愿吐露的心事，然而样子是那般沉痛真挚，使人听了不能不受感动。伊莎贝尔动情得半天都说不出话来，最后才问道：

“你出去待一阵子，会不会好一些呢？”

话一出口，她的心便沉了下来。

拉里沉吟良久方才回答：

“我想是的。不理睬社会舆论，着实不易。当社会舆论向你压来时，会激发你的逆反之心。你的心情也会因而得不到安宁。”

“那你为什么不一走了之？”

“唔，是为了你呗。”

“咱们不妨把话说得直白些，亲爱的。就目前而言，你的生活中恐怕没有我的一席之地。”

“这是不是说，你不想和我保持订婚的关系了？”

伊莎贝尔芳唇直抖，挤出了一个笑容。

“不，别说蠢话。我的意思是等你归来。”

“也许要等一年，或者两年呢。”

“这没有关系。也许等不了那么长时间。你打算上哪儿去呢？”

他望着她，目光专注，仿佛想要看到她内心深处似的。她微微一笑，以此掩饰自己内心的悲苦。

“哦，我想先去巴黎。那边我一个人不认识。不会有人干涉我的生活的。战时休假，我去过几趟巴黎。不知怎么的，我有一种感觉：一到了那里，浑浊的大脑就会变得清晰。那是一个奇妙的地方，叫你觉得一切问题都会迎刃而解，胸中的块垒会消失得无影无踪。我想到了那里也许就能看清前进的方向了。”

“假如不能如愿，你又该如何？”

他嘻嘻嘻地笑了笑。

“那样我就改弦更张，重拾我的美国人生观，痛改前非，回到芝加哥来，有什么工作就干什么工作。”

这次深谈对伊莎贝尔触动很大。她对我讲述时，免不了有些激动。待把话说完，她望了望我，表情惹人哀怜。

“你觉得我做得对吗？”

“我觉得你做了自己力所能及的事情。另外，我还觉得你有一副菩萨心肠，待人仁厚，善解人意。”

“我爱他，希望他能够生活幸福。要知道，从某些方面来说，他离开家乡，我并不感到遗憾。我想让他摆脱这种充满敌意的环境，不仅是为了他，也是为了我自己。我不能怪那些人说他不会有什么出息；我恨他们，然而我的内心深处总有一种忧虑，觉得他们说得有道理。不过，请别说我善解人意。对于他在追求什么，我还是理解不透的。”

“也许你的心能理解，但从理智上却理解不透。”我笑笑说，“为什么你不立刻和他结婚，跟他一起到巴黎去？”

她的眼睛里微微露出了一丝笑意。

“我巴不得这样做，可是我不能。要知道，虽然我不愿承认，但我内心真实地觉得，没有我，他的境况会更好一些。如果纳尔逊医生的话说得对，他的病是一种慢性惊恐症。换换环境，接触新的事物，会使他康复如初。等到内心恢复了平静，他就会回到芝加哥来，像周围的人一样工作和生活。我可不愿嫁给一个闲汉。”

伊莎贝尔从小受环境的影响，已经接受了大人给她灌输的原则。对于金钱，她并不多加考虑，因为她从小到大从未尝过缺钱的滋味。不过，出于本能，她可以感觉到钱的重要性——钱意味着权势和社会地位。作为一个男人，挣钱是天经地义的事。这也是他一生的事业。

“要说你理解不透拉里，我并不感到奇怪。”我说，“我敢肯定，连他本人也理解不透自己。他只字不提自己的人生目标，那是因为他的人生目标是模糊不清的。实不相瞒，我跟他并无深交，此处所言仅仅是猜测——他是不是在寻找某样东西，某样他并不了解甚至都不知道是否存在的东西呢？也许，他在战争中不知经历了什么事情，才使得他躁动不安，得不到安宁。依你看，他是不是在追求一种虚无缥缈的理想——就像天文学家在寻找一颗只有数学计算说明其存在的星体一样？”

“我觉得有种什么东西在搅扰着他。”

“你指的是他的灵魂吗？也许，他所害怕的是他自己吧。也许，他隐隐约约看到了某种景象——至于这种景象是否真实，他并无把握。”

“他有时候叫我觉得他行为古怪，给我一种印象——他像是个梦游者，在一个陌生的地方突然醒过来，摸不清自己身在何处。参战之前，他是很正常的。那时，他最可爱的地方是对生活的热爱。他悠闲潇洒，乐乐呵呵的，跟他在一起十分开心。那时的他甜蜜可人，说话妙语连珠。到底发生了什么事情，才令他与以前相比判若两人了呢？”

“这种情况我也说不清。有时候，一件小事情对一个人就会有很大的影响，那要取决于他当时的处境和心情。记得有一次过全圣节（法国人称之为亡人节），我到一个村庄的教堂去做弥撒——德军最初一攻入法国，那座村庄就遭到了军队的蹂躏。教堂里挤满了军人和穿着丧服的女人；教堂墓园里看得到一排排木制的小十字架。弥撒庄严、悲伤，女人们泪流满面，男人们也伤心落泪。我当时有个感觉，认为长眠于那些小十字架下面的死人可能比活着的人还要好受些。我把自己的感受讲给一个朋友听，他问我那是什么意思，我却难以解释得清。看得出，他认为我是个十足的傻瓜。我还记得，在一次战斗之后，阵亡法军士兵的尸体被堆放在一起，像小山一样，看上去就像一堆提线木偶，被破了产的木偶剧团胡乱丢在肮脏角落里，因为它们再也派不上用场了。当时我想到的就是拉里告诉你的那句话：‘人死如灯灭。死了，一了百了。’”

我可不想让读者觉得我在故弄玄虚，给深深影响了拉里的那段战争经历蒙上一层神秘的色彩，非得等到最后才揭开谜底。对于那段经历，他恐怕给任何人都没有讲过。过去了许多年之后，他才对我们俩都认识的一个叫苏姗娜·鲁维埃的女子讲述了那段如烟的往事，说一位年轻的飞行员为了救他而牺牲了自己的生命。苏姗娜·鲁维埃把他的话转述给我，而我只能根据二手材料进行复述，而且是从她的法语翻译过来的。拉里显然跟飞行队里的另一个小伙子结下了很深的友谊。苏姗娜不知道那个小伙子的名姓，只知道他的一个很滑稽的绰号——那是拉里讲到他时提到的。

“他是个红头发的小个子，爱尔兰人，我们都叫他‘捣蛋鬼’。”拉里这样告诉苏姗娜，在我认识的人里面，他最具活力，简直可以说是生龙活虎。他长了一张滑稽的脸，脸上挂着一副滑稽的笑容，见了他，你禁不住就会发笑。他是个闯祸精，什么荒唐事都干得出来，总是挨上司的骂。他完全是个天不怕地不怕的主儿，战场上九死一生捡回一条命，他也会一脸笑嘻嘻的样子，就好像出生入死是天下最好玩的事情一样。不过，他天生就是个当飞行员的料，一上蓝天就变得冷静、机警。他教给我不少东西。他比我年纪大一点，因此将我置于他的保护伞之下。这实在具有喜剧效果——我比他要高出六英寸，论打架，我可以轻松地把他放倒。一次在巴黎，他喝得酩酊大醉，我怕他惹是生非，果真把他放倒过。

“加入飞行队时，我觉得有些跟不上趟，生怕自己干不好。他百般勉励我，让我树立自信心。他对战争的看法离奇古怪，对德国人没有丝毫敌意，只是因为爱打架，才乐颠颠地喜欢和德国人交锋。每击落一架敌机，他只是觉得好玩而已。他是个无法无天的人，行为粗野，无拘无束。但他身上有一种诚恳的素质，叫你不由得会喜欢上他。他会把你的钱拿去花，而为了你，他也愿意倾尽钱囊。如果你觉得孤独，或者想家，或者害怕，像我有时候那样，他就会看出来，让他那张丑陋的小脸上堆满笑容，然后说一些贴心的话，使你的心情恢复正常。”

说到这里，拉里抽了一口烟斗，苏姗在等着他继续说下去。

我们经常编造出一些事由，以便我俩一起出去度假。每次去巴黎，他就狂放不羁。那段时间，我们玩得真开心。一九一八年的三月，我们又准备出去度假，并提前做出了安排。我们的计划满满的，有许多事情要做。就在临行前一天，我们奉命飞越敌军防线侦察，把侦察到的情况带回来。突然，我们与几架敌机遭遇。没等我们反应过来，双方已经进入了激战。一架敌机追过来，但我先下手将其击中，然后转过脸去看它会不会坠落。就在这时，我从眼角看过去，发现又有一架敌机盯上了我。我向下俯冲想躲开它，可它一转眼就追上了我，我想这一下可完了。却看见‘捣蛋鬼’闪电般冲过来，把雨点般的子弹泼在它身上。敌机战不过我们，夹着尾巴逃跑了，我们也返回了基地。我的飞机给打得遍体鳞伤，算是挣扎着着陆了。而‘捣蛋鬼’先我一步着陆。我下飞机时，他们刚把他抬出驾驶舱。他躺在地上，在等救护车来。他看见我，咧开嘴笑了。

‘那狗日的盯住你不放，我把他打下来了。’他说道。

“你怎么啦，”捣蛋鬼？我问他。

‘哦，没什么，他打中了我的胳臂。’

“只见他脸色惨白。突然间，他的脸上浮现出一种古怪的神情。他此时才醒悟到自己快要死了。在这之前，他心里从没想到过自己竟然还会死去。没等周围的人反应过来，他一挺身坐了起来，哈哈大笑道：‘他妈的，我死啦！’说完，他就倒下去死了，年仅二十二岁。他原本打算在战争结束后回爱尔兰，跟一个爱尔兰姑娘结婚呢。”

和伊莎贝尔长谈后的第二天，我就离开芝加哥去了旧金山，准备从那儿乘船前往远东。





第二章


一


一直到第二年的六月末，艾略特来到伦敦，我才和他又见了面。我问他拉里到巴黎去了没有，他说去了。他对拉里窝了一肚子的火，这叫我听了暗自发笑。

“我对这孩子素有恻隐之心，他想来巴黎待上两年，我毫不怪他，而且还准备帮助他一把。我告诉他，一到巴黎就通知我。后来路易莎写信告诉我，说他在巴黎时，我才知道他已经来了。我让美国运通公司转给他一封信（地址是路易莎给我的），请他来吃饭，让他认识几位我觉得有必要认识的人。我一厢情愿地想让他先结交一些法裔美国人，其中有爱米丽·德·蒙塔杜尔和格拉西·德·夏托加亚尔等。你猜他是怎么回复的？他说很抱歉不能来，因为他来法国时没带晚礼服。”

艾略特眼睛盯着我，以为他的一席话会叫我的脸上出现惊讶的神情，却发现我声色不动，于是便一抬眉毛，露出了不悦。

“他的回信写在一张劣质信纸上，上面印有拉丁区一家咖啡馆的名字。我又写了封信给他，要他把住址告诉我。我觉得，看在伊莎贝尔的分上，我也得帮他一把。我当时以为他不愿来是怕见生人——我简直无法相信一个头脑正常的年轻人来巴黎怎么能不带晚礼服；而且不管怎样说，巴黎的裁缝铺也还是不错的。这次我说明是请他吃午饭，客人也不多。可是，你恐怕不会相信，他无视我的请求，没有把住址告诉我，仍托美国运通公司转来回信；这还不够，他竟然说自己从不吃午饭。这一下，叫我拿他一点办法都没有了。”

“不知道他现在在干些什么。”

“鬼才知道。实话说，他干什么我才不管呢。恐怕这个小青年是个极不成器的人。伊莎贝尔嫁给他，肯定是个大错误。如果他是个正儿八经的人，就应该出入于里茨酒吧间或者富凯饭店等场所，而非拉丁区的咖啡馆。”

这些时尚的高级场所，有时候我自己也出入，但不时尚的地方我也去。那年的初秋时分，我到马赛去，准备乘法邮公司的船前往新加坡，途中路过巴黎时在那儿住了几天。一天傍晚，我和几个朋友在蒙巴纳斯街区吃过晚饭，一同去多姆咖啡店喝杯啤酒。我四周瞧瞧，一眼看见拉里在人满为患的露台上，独自坐在一张大理石面的小桌旁。他悠闲地望着街上来往的行人——闷热的白天刚过，人们在享受晚间的凉爽。我丢下同伴朝着他走了过去。他看见我，脸上顿时放出亮光，抛给我一个迷人的微笑。他请我坐下，可我说是跟朋友们一起来的，不便多待。

“我来只是想向你问声好。”我说道。

“你住在巴黎吗？”他问。

“只住几天。”

“明天跟我一起吃午饭好吗？”

“我还以为你从不吃午饭呢？”

他哧哧地笑了。

“看来你见过艾略特了。我一般是不吃的，没有时间吃，只喝杯牛奶、吃块蛋糕对付一下。不过，我倒是想跟你一起吃顿午饭。”

“那好吧。”

我们约好次日来多姆咖啡店见，先喝杯开胃酒，然后去林荫大道找个馆子吃饭。商定之后，我便回到那几个朋友身旁谈天说地。待我转过头再去看拉里，发现他已经走了。





二


第二天上午，我度过了一段惬意的时光。先是到卢森堡博物馆去，用去一个小时观赏自己喜欢的画作，随后我就悠然散步于花园中，追忆已经逝去的青春年华。这儿一点变化都没有。但见青年学子成双成对漫步在沙砾小径上，兴奋地谈论着叫他们热血沸腾的作家；孩子们在保姆的照看下滚铁环玩耍；老人们一边晒太阳一边读晨报；几个正在服丧的中年妇女坐在公共长凳上唠嗑，议论食品的价格和用人的不端行为。眼前的人和景依稀宛如当年。后来我去了奥德昂大剧院，在剧院的长廊里浏览陈列在那儿的新书。我看见几个少年跟我三十年前一样，顶着身穿长罩衫的书亭老板那恼怒的目光，如饥似渴地阅读自己所买不起的书。出了大剧院，我迈着四方步走在那亲切、幽暗的偏街小巷，到了蒙巴纳斯街区，再走到多姆咖啡馆。拉里已在那儿等候。喝了杯酒，我们就慢慢悠悠去找吃饭的地方了，想找一家可以在室外进餐的馆子。

与上次见他时相比，他的脸色也许苍白了些，这倒让他那双深陷在眼窝里的乌黑的眸子更加炯炯有神。他还是那样矜持自重，这对一个小青年来说是很少见的；他的笑容依然坦率真诚。他点饭菜时，我留意到他说一口流利的法语，语音纯正。为此，我向他表示祝贺。

“要知道，我以前懂得一点法语。”他解释说，“路易莎伯母给伊莎贝尔请了个法国家庭女教师。在马文的时候，那位教师让我们跟她讲法语，始终坚持这么做。”

我问他喜欢不喜欢巴黎。

“非常喜欢。”

“你在蒙巴纳斯街区住吗？”

“是的。”他迟疑了一下才回答道。我猜想他这是不愿说出自己确切的住址。

“你给艾略特只留了美国运通公司业务点的地址，叫他十分生气。”

拉里笑笑，什么也没说。

“你成天干些什么呢？”

“逛大街。”

“还看书吗？”

“是的，还看。”

“跟伊莎贝尔通信吗？”

“有时候通通信。我俩都不擅于写信。她在芝加哥过得很开心。明年她们要来法国，在艾略特这儿待待。”

“这对你们俩是件好事。”

“据我所知，伊莎贝尔没来过巴黎。领着她四处走走，一定会很有趣的。”

对于我的中国之行，他充满了好奇之心，很想听我讲一讲。当我开始讲述时，他听得非常专注。可是我想让他谈谈他自己的情况时，他却三缄其口。他的沉默使我只能有一个结论——他约我吃饭仅仅是想和我一起坐坐。我虽然感到高兴，心里却百般困惑。喝完咖啡，他就叫结账，付了钱，然后站起了身子。

“哦，我得走了。”他说。

我们分了手。对于他的人生目标，我仍然知之甚少。那以后，我再没有见过他。





三


直至来年春天，我才又回到了巴黎。布雷德利夫人和伊莎贝尔将计划提前，已经抵达巴黎，在艾略特家里住了下来。这中间隔了有好几个星期，因此，我又得运用想象力，凑合着叙述母女俩这段时间的经历……她们在瑟堡上的岸，历来善于体贴人的艾略特前往迎接。过了海关之后，三个人上了火车。火车启动时，艾略特扬扬得意地宣称给她们请了个相当棒的女仆伺候她们。布雷德利夫人说完全没有这个必要，她们不需要女仆。艾略特听了，顿时变得声色俱厉起来。

“不要一来就惹人生气，路易莎。没有女仆是见不了人的。我请安托瓦内特来，不仅是为了你和伊莎贝尔，也是为了给我争面子。你们的穿戴不体面，会叫我无地自容的。”

说着，他瞥了一眼母女俩身上的衣服，一脸的瞧不起。

“当然，你们要购置点新衣服。我想来想去，认为只有沙诺尔式女装[30]店最合适。”

“我以前一直都是去沃思服装店。”布雷德利夫人说。

她这话说了也是白说，因为艾略特根本不予理睬。

“我跟沙诺尔式女装店说过了，约你们明天下午三点去那儿。另外还需要买帽子——当然是要莱伯克斯牌子的喽。”

“我不想多花钱，艾略特。”

“我知道。所有的一切花销都由我出就是了。我只想让你给我争点面子。好啦，路易莎，我特意为你安排了几场宴会。我告诉我的法国朋友，说迈伦曾经是位大使——他要是活的时间再长一些，这是板上钉钉的事情。这样说，给人的印象好一些。这件事不会有人问起的，但我觉得还是先给你打个招呼好。”

“你真是荒唐可笑，艾略特。”

“哪里的话。我懂得人情世故，深知一个大使的遗孀比一个部长的遗孀更有身份。”

火车喷着蒸汽驶进了巴黎北站。站在车窗前的伊莎贝尔叫了起来：

“拉里来了。”

没等火车停稳，她便跳下了车，迎着拉里跑去。拉里张开双臂将她搂在怀中。

“他怎么知道你们来？”艾略特酸溜溜地问姐姐。

“伊莎贝尔在船上给他发了封电报。”

布雷德利夫人疼爱地吻了吻拉里，艾略特无精打采地跟他握了握手。寒暄间，已经是晚上十点钟了。

“舅舅，拉里明天能不能来吃午饭？”伊莎贝尔高声问道。她挽着拉里的胳膊，脸上一副恳切的神情，眼睛里闪着光芒。

“这是我的荣幸。不过，我似乎听拉里说过他从不吃午饭。”

“明天他会吃的，是不是，拉里？”

“是的。”拉里莞尔一笑说。

“那么，明天一点钟恭候你大驾光临。”

艾略特又伸出手来，想把他打发走，可是拉里咧着嘴笑，厚着脸皮不肯离去。

“我要帮着搬行李，再给你们叫辆汽车。”

“我的车在等着呢，我的用人会照管行李的。”艾略特盛气凌人地说。

“那好呀。那咱们就走吧。如果汽车里有我坐的位子，我就送你们到家门口。”

“有你坐的地方。一起走，拉里。”伊莎贝尔说。

两个年轻人沿着站台走了，布雷德利夫人和艾略特跟在后面。艾略特黑着脸，一副不情愿的样子。

“没素质。[31]”他在嘴里咕哝了一句。在某种情况下，他觉得讲法语能够更有力地表达自己的情绪。

翌日上午十一点钟，艾略特起了床（他平素总睡懒觉），洗漱完毕，写了个便条，由男仆约瑟夫和女佣安托瓦内特转两道手交给他的姐姐，约她到书房来谈话。布雷德利夫人来了之后，他谨慎地关上门，把一支香烟装在一根非常长的玛瑙烟嘴上点着，然后坐下来。

“是不是可以说，伊莎贝尔和拉里还有着订婚的约定吧？”他启口问道。

“恐怕是这样的。”

“对这个小青年，我恐怕没什么好话可说的。”他冲着布雷德利夫人大倒苦水，说他怎样煞费苦心想将拉里引入上流社会，说他怎样针对拉里量体裁衣，制订了整套的计划。“我甚至还为他瞧上了一套低层的住房[32]，非常适合他住。那房子属于德·勒泰勒小侯爵，他被派驻马德里的大使馆任职，所以想把房子租出去。”

可是，拉里把他的好心当成了驴肝肺，谢绝了他的邀请，显然是不愿意接受他的帮助。

“假如你不愿利用巴黎得天独厚的条件，那你为什么要到巴黎来？实在叫人百思不得其解。不知道他在捣鼓些什么。他在这儿好像无亲无友的。你知道他的住址吗？”

“他只给了我们一个地址，那就是美国运通公司。”

“看他就像个云游四方的推销员或者来度假的教师，居无定所。他要是在蒙马特高地[33]的一间画室里跟一个下流女人同居，那我一点也不感到惊奇。”

“别胡说，艾略特！”

“他把自己的住处搞得神秘兮兮，又拒绝跟自己同阶层的人来往，除此之外，难道还会有别的解释吗？”

“拉里不像是那号子人。昨天晚上你不是也看到了，他和从前一样深爱着伊莎贝尔吗？那样的假他可是作不出来的。”

艾略特耸耸肩膀，意思是告诉他姐姐，男人们逢场作戏的手腕是极其高明的。

“格雷·马图林怎样？还在追吗？”

“只要伊莎贝尔肯答应，他恨不得马上就跟她结婚。”

接着，布雷德利夫人告诉了艾略特她们比原定计划提早来到欧洲的原因。她发现自己的健康状况不好，医生说她患上了糖尿病。病情并不严重，只要注意饮食，适当地服用胰岛素，完全能够活上好多年。可是，她在知道自己得了这种不治之症之后，急切想看见伊莎贝尔有一个好的归宿。母女俩谈过这件事。伊莎贝尔很明智，说如果拉里在巴黎住了两年之后，不遵照原议回到芝加哥，并且找个工作做，那就只有一条路可走——跟他一刀两断。可是，布雷德利夫人觉得要等到约定的时间，然后去巴黎把拉里像个逃犯一样抓回美国，有损个人的尊严。她觉得伊莎贝尔那样做很失面子。不过，母女俩来欧洲消夏却是很正常的——伊莎贝尔自从长大之后，再也没到欧洲来过。她们打算在巴黎待过之后，去一个海滨度假地让布雷德利夫人养养病，再从那里前往奥地利的蒂罗尔山区住住，然后慢慢悠悠穿过意大利。布雷德利夫人有意约拉里同行。路上，让拉里和伊莎贝尔相互了解了解，看他们在久别之后感情是否仍一如既往。至于拉里在经过了一段时间的恣意放纵的生活之后，是不是愿意承担起责任来，到时候自会明白。

“拉里拒绝了亨利·马图林提供给他的工作，叫对方觉得很不痛快，多亏格雷打圆场，才算让父亲消了气。拉里只要回芝加哥，立刻就可以有工作干。”

“格雷是个大好人。”

“一点没说的。”布雷德利夫人叹了口气说，“伊莎贝尔嫁给他，一定会幸福的。”

接下来，艾略特介绍了给她们母女安排了几场什么样的宴会。明天下午他要举办的是场大型午宴，周末安排的则是一个气势恢宏的晚宴。他还要带她们去参加查迪乌·加拉兹家的招待会，而且还给她们弄到两张舞会请帖，届时将去罗慈吉尔兹府上跳舞。

“拉里你也要请吧？”

“他告诉我，说他没有晚礼服。”艾略特哼了声鼻子说。

“哎，反正你请他一下就是了。说到底，他是个挺不错的小伙子。冷冰冰地对待他没有什么用处，只会叫伊莎贝尔更加执拗。”

“当然，你要我请我就请吧。”

拉里在约定的时间赶来赴午宴。但见艾略特热情洋溢、礼貌周到，对拉里更是和蔼可亲。对拉里待之以礼并不难，因为他满面春风、兴致勃勃的，艾略特又不是一个天性恶毒的人，哪能不产生好感。午宴上，大家以芝加哥为话题，大谈彼此都认识的朋友，把艾略特给晾在了一旁，他只好做出和和气气的样子，摆一副屈尊俯就的架势，好像很关心这些在他眼里毫无社会地位的人似的，关心他们的痛痒。听客人们海阔天空地说话，他并不排斥。其实，听到某一对年轻男女订婚了，某一对年轻男女结婚了，某一对年轻男女离婚了，他觉得怪惹人同情的。听到这样的事情，哪能不动情呢？据他所知，年轻美丽的德·科林尚特女爵曾为情试图服毒自杀——她的情人德·科龙贝亲王抛弃她，娶了个南美洲百万富翁的千金。这样的话题说起来的确津津有味。看看拉里，他不得不承认他有种异常吸引人的地方。拉里那深陷的、乌黑乌黑的眼睛，那高颧骨、苍白的皮肤和灵巧的嘴，让他联想起波提切利[34]的一幅画像，觉得如果叫拉里穿上那个时代的服装，看上去一定充满浪漫气息。他记起自己曾经打算把拉里介绍给一位显赫的法国女人，同时想到星期六晚宴邀请了玛丽·路易丝·德·弗洛里蒙，禁不住偷偷笑了。这个女人交游甚广，道德上却臭名昭著，两点兼而有之。她四十岁的年龄，看上去却要年轻十岁。纳蒂埃[35]曾经为她的一个女祖先画过像，这张像通过艾略特亲自努力，现挂在美国的一个大画廊里。玛丽生得就和她这个女祖先同样千娇百媚，而她在性生活方面欲壑难填，好像永远不能满足似的。艾略特决定让拉里坐在她身边。他知道玛丽会不失时机地叫拉里懂得她的欲望。他还请了英国大使馆的一位年轻的侍从武官，认为伊莎贝尔说不定会喜欢上的。伊莎贝尔脸蛋长得漂亮，那个英国人家境阔绰，虽然伊莎贝尔没有财产，也是没有关系的。一开始吃饭，大伙儿便觥筹交错，先喝上等蒙哈榭白葡萄酒，继而喝味道纯正的波尔多酒，喝得艾略特轻飘飘的，心里乐悠悠地遐想着各种可能出现的情况。如果事态的发展如他估计的那般，亲爱的路易莎就没有什么可焦虑的了。路易莎总是有点把他的话不当回事，可怜的人儿，怪都怪她见的世面太少。不过，他喜欢自己的这个姐姐。利用自己走南闯北积累下的经验为她把一切安排得停停当当，也是一件称心的事情。

为了不浪费时间，艾略特安排好一吃完午饭就带路易莎母女去看衣服。所以，客人们才从餐桌旁站起身，他便用自己最擅长的辞令暗示拉里可以离开了，同时又以诚恳、亲切的语气邀请他来参加自己安排的两场盛大宴会。其实他没必要多虑，因为拉里一听很痛快就答应了下来。

可是，艾略特的计划落空了。话说拉里来参加晚宴时，穿了一套很像样的晚礼服，艾略特看见后松了一口气。起初他还有点担心，怕拉里穿上次午宴时的那身蓝西装呢。晚饭后，艾略特把玛丽·德·弗洛里蒙拉到角落里，问她觉得他的这位年轻美国朋友怎么样。

“他有一双漂亮的眼睛和一口好看的牙齿。”

“仅此而已吗？我让他坐在你身边，是觉得他合你的口味。”

她疑惑地看了看他。

“他告诉我，说已经跟你漂亮的外甥女订婚了。”

“得了吧，亲爱的。[36]一个男子属于一个女子，只要你办得到，这可不会妨碍你横刀夺爱的。”

“你想让我夺人之爱？可怜的艾略特，我绝不会替你干这种卑鄙勾当的。”

艾略特嘿嘿一笑。

“听你的话音，我觉得你好像已经试过水了，只是没有进展罢了。”

“艾略特，我喜欢的就是你的这种妓院老板般的品性。你不愿意让他娶你的外甥女。为什么？他有教养，而且很讨人喜欢。不过，他未免太单纯了些，可能丝毫没有怀疑我的动机。”

“你应该把意图表现得更明确些，亲爱的朋友。”

“你是情场老手，明知这是白费气力。他的眼睛里只有你家的小伊莎贝尔。咱俩之间说说——她的优势在于她比我年轻二十岁。而且，她甜美可人。”

“你喜欢她的衣服吗？我亲自给她挑的。”

“样式漂亮，也很合身。只可惜她没有高雅的风度。”

艾略特认定后半句话是冲着他来的，觉得不能轻易放过她，非得戳一下她的痛处不可。于是他满脸堆起亲切的笑容，款款说道：

“一个人非得活到你这样成熟的年龄，才会有高雅的风度，亲爱的。”

德·弗洛里蒙夫人手里挥动的是一根大棒，而非烧火棍，杀伤力很大。她的反唇相讥让艾略特身上的弗吉尼亚血液沸腾了起来。

“我可以肯定，在你们那个土匪横行的美丽国家里（votre beau pays dapaches[37]），如此微妙、如此独特的东西，人们是不会有所欠缺的。”

虽则德·弗洛里蒙夫人横挑鼻子竖挑眼，艾略特其他的朋友对伊莎贝尔和拉里他们俩，都还是挺喜欢的。他们喜欢伊莎贝尔的青春美，喜欢她充溢的健康和蓬勃的活力；他们喜欢拉里生动的外表，喜欢他儒雅的谈吐以及他那含蓄、带有讽刺意味的幽默。二人讲一口标准、流利的法语，这也是他们的一大优点。布雷德利夫人在外交界生活多年，法语说得还算标准，只是夹带着一点美国腔调，她却不以为然。艾略特对待她们母女极为慷慨。伊莎贝尔喜欢自己的新衣新帽，也喜欢艾略特安排的各种叫人心花怒放的活动。还有，和拉里在一起，她感到很幸福。她觉得自己从来都没有如此快活过。

艾略特认为，只有接待生客才陪着吃早饭，那也是万不得已的事情。布雷德利夫人和伊莎贝尔只好在各自的寝室用早点了，布雷德利夫人很不情愿，伊莎贝尔却丝毫不在意。不过，有时候伊莎贝尔醒来后，会叫艾略特给她们雇的那个高贵女佣安托瓦内特把她的一份咖啡牛奶送到她母亲的寝室，母女俩好在吃早点时聊聊天。她整天忙得滴溜溜转，一天当中只有这点时间能陪母亲坐坐。她们来巴黎快一个月后的一个这样的早晨，伊莎贝尔先把昨天晚上做的事情叙述了一遍，无非是说她和拉里随一群朋友逛夜总会什么的；接着，布雷德利夫人提出了一个问题——这个问题自打来巴黎后一直压在她的心头。

“他打算什么时候回芝加哥？”

“不知道。他提都没提过。”

“你没有问过吗？”

“没有。”

“你是不是怕问？”

“不是，当然不是。”

布雷德利夫人斜倚在长靠椅上修指甲，身上穿一件正流行的晨衣——一件拉里执意要送给她的礼物。

“你俩在一起都说些什么？”

“我们一般不说话。两人在一起坐坐就很好了。你知道拉里总是沉默寡言的。交谈起来，差不多都是我一人在讲话。”

“他平时干些什么？”

“我也弄不清楚，只觉得没有干什么大事。我想他过得挺开心的。”

“他住在哪里？”

“这我也不知道。”

“他好像城府很深呀，对不对？”

伊莎贝尔点起一支香烟，从鼻孔里喷出一缕烟，静静地望着自己的母亲。

“你这话究竟是什么意思，妈妈？”

“你舅舅认为他租了一套公寓，跟一个女人同居。”

伊莎贝尔不听则已，一听笑破了肚皮。

“这话你相信吗，妈妈？”

“不相信，老实说我不相信。”布雷德利夫人望着自己的指甲，沉吟良久，“你可曾跟他谈过回芝加哥的事？”

“谈过，谈过不知多少次了。”

“他是否有所表示，说他打算回去呢？”

“恐怕没有什么表示。”

“十月份他离开家乡就满两年了。”

“这我知道。”

“这是你的事情，亲爱的，你觉得该怎么做就怎么做吧。不过，久拖不决也不是个事呀。”布雷德利夫人盯着女儿，但伊莎贝尔将目光躲开了。布雷德利夫人疼爱地冲她一笑。“去吧，去洗个澡准备准备，吃午饭可别迟了。”

“我要跟拉里去吃午饭。在拉丁区的一个什么地方。”

“好好玩去吧。”

一小时后，拉里来接她。二人叫了辆出租车去了圣米歇尔桥，然后沿着人头攒动的林荫大道转悠，最后相中了一家咖啡店。他们在这家店的露台上落座，叫了两杯杜本内开胃酒[38]。出了咖啡店，他们又叫车去了一家饭馆。伊莎贝尔胃口很好，拉里点的那些可口的饭菜她都吃得津津有味。饭馆里顾客盈门，吃客们你挨着我、我靠着你坐在一起进餐，这场面叫伊莎贝尔看了挺开心的。瞧见人们狼吞虎咽的吃相，她会禁不住笑出声来。不过，她最为开心的是能够和拉里单独在一起，卿卿我我地坐在一张小桌旁。她兴高采烈地说这说那，拉里听着眼里闪出欢快的光芒，这让她看在眼中喜在心头。跟拉里无拘无束坐在一起，让她感到陶然若醉。但她的内心深处隐隐约约有一丝不安——拉里虽然也无拘无束的，她却觉得真正给他以轻松感的与其说是她，倒不如说是周围的环境。母亲早上说的话对她有所触动。于是，她叽叽喳喳说着话，似乎一点心思也没有，实际却在观察他的每一细小表情。拉里和最初离开芝加哥时相比略有不同，但她说不清他究竟发生了什么变化。他看上去跟以前别无二致，还是那么年轻，那么坦率，只是神情却有了变化。这种神情并不是比以前更严肃（他脸上总有一副严肃的表情），而是多了一份从前所没有的安宁。他好像解决了一道人生的难题，如今寻找到了心灵的安宁——这是前所未有的现象。

吃完饭，拉里建议去逛卢森堡博物馆。

“不，我不想去看画。”

“好吧，那就去花园里坐坐。”

“不，我也不想去那里。我要去看看你住的地方。”

“没什么可看的，我住在旅馆的一个很寒酸的斗室里。”

“艾略特舅舅说你有一套公寓，跟一个画家的模特儿同居。”

“无稽之谈。那你亲眼去看看好啦。”他大笑道，“从这里去只有几步路。咱们可以步行过去。”

他带着她穿过几条狭窄的、弯弯曲曲的街道——这些街道夹在高房子中间，可以望见一抹青天，显得肮脏暗淡。走了一会儿，二人来到了一家门面寒碜的小旅馆。

“咱们到了。”

伊莎贝尔随着他走进一间狭窄的厅堂，厅堂的一侧有一张桌子，桌旁坐着个男子，穿一件衬衣和一个细黑黄条子相间的背心，系一条围裙，正在那里看报。拉里问他要房间的钥匙，那人从身后格子架里把钥匙取出交给了他，同时好奇地瞥了伊莎贝尔一眼，又转为会意的傻笑。显然他认为伊莎贝尔去拉里的房间不是干规矩事情的。

他们爬上两段楼梯，楼梯上铺着破旧的红地毯。拉里用钥匙打开房间的门。伊莎贝尔走进一间有两扇窗户的小房间。从窗口望去，街对面是一幢灰颜色的公寓楼，公寓楼的底层开着一家文具店。小房间里有一张单人床，配一个床头柜，另外还有一口镶着大镜子的笨重的衣柜，一把装了垫子但是椅背笔直的扶手椅，两扇窗子之间放一张桌子，桌子上有架打字机、一些纸张和几本书。壁炉板上堆放了些平装书。

“你坐扶手椅吧，虽然不太舒服，却是这里最好的了。”

他另外拉过来一把椅子，自己也坐下了。

“你就住在这地方？”伊莎贝尔问。

他看见她脸上的神情，扑哧一声笑了。

“可不是么。来巴黎后，我一直住在这里。”

“为什么？”

“图个方便呗。这儿靠近国家图书馆和巴黎大学。”他指指她没有注意到的一扇门说，“这里有洗澡的地方，有早餐吃。晚饭一般就在咱们吃午饭的那家饭馆解决。”

“这地方太寒酸了。”

“哦，还好吧，有这地方住就不错了。”

“这儿住的都是些什么人呢？”

“哦，不太清楚。上面阁楼里住了几个学生。其他的还有两三个在政府机关里做事的老光棍和一个奥德昂大剧院的退休女演员。另有一个房间也是带浴室的，住着一个被包了身的女人，她的男朋友每隔一个星期四来看她。除此之外，恐怕还有些暂住的客人。这地方很安静，适于居住。”

伊莎贝尔听了有点窘迫，被拉里瞧在了眼里并感到好笑，这一来就叫她有些气恼了。

“桌子上那本大厚书是什么书？”她问。

“哪本？噢，那是我的希腊字典。”

“你的什么来着？”她提高了嗓门问。

“你看看也没有关系，它不会咬你的。”

“你在学希腊语吗？”

“是的。”

“为什么？”

“可能是个人爱好吧。”

他说话时望着她，眼睛里带着微笑，她也冲他笑了笑。

“你能不能告诉我，来巴黎后这么长时间你都做了些什么？”

“我花大量时间看书，每天用去八至十个小时吧。另外还到巴黎大学听讲座。法国文学中重要的作品，我想自己都读遍了。现在我能看得懂拉丁文了，至少能看懂拉丁散文了，如今看拉丁文几乎跟看法文一样轻松了。当然，学希腊语是比较难的。不过，我有个非常好的老师。你来之前，我每周去他那儿学三个晚上。”

“这样做的目的何在？”

“掌握知识呗。”他笑了笑说。

“这好像不太实际。”

“也许不太实际，另一方面，也许却又是实际的。追求知识本身就是极大的乐趣。你想象不来，阅读原文版的《奥德赛》该是多么令人激动。你有一种感觉，好像一踮脚尖，伸出手就能够着星星似的。”

他起身离开椅子，像是兴奋得不能自已，在小房间里来来回回踱起了步。

“这一两个月我在看斯宾诺莎[39]的书。我不敢说自己理解得十分透彻，然而心里却充满了欢乐。就好像是乘飞机来到了高山之巅的一处辽阔的平原上，周围空无一人，空气清新得犹如芬芳的美酒，沁人心脾。你觉得自己就像是个极其富有的人。”

“你什么时候回芝加哥呢？”

“芝加哥？不知道。我没有想过这件事。”

“你不是说过，如果你两年之后还找不到你要找的东西，就改弦更张吗？”

“反正我现在是不能回去的。我刚刚迈过了一道门槛，看见一望无际的精神王国展现在我的面前，它在向我招手，我急切地要到那儿去瞧瞧。”

“你想到那里寻找什么呢？”

“寻找问题的答案。”他说完瞅了她一眼，眼神中带几分戏谑。她如若不是对他知根知底，也许会觉得他在开玩笑呢。“我想弄清楚到底有没有上帝，弄清楚为什么会有邪恶。我想知道灵魂是不朽的，还是人一死，灵魂也跟着消亡。”

伊莎贝尔倒抽了一口气。听见拉里这般说话，她觉得怪不舒服，幸亏他语调轻轻松松，跟平时说话别无二致，她这才没有将内心的窘迫表露出来。

“可是，拉里，”她微笑说，“这样的问题人类已经提出来几千年了，如果能够解答的话，肯定早已有答案了。”

拉里笑了一声。

“请别这么笑，弄得好像我在说蠢话似的。”她沉下脸说。

“恰恰相反，我认为你说得在理。但从另一方面看，假如人类提出这样的问题达数千年之久，那就证明这样的问题是很有必要提出的，以后还会继续提出来。至于说无人能解答这种问题，那是不对的。人类寻找到的答案已经超出了问题本身。许多人给出的答案十分完美。鲁斯布鲁克老人就是一例。”

“鲁斯布鲁克是谁？”

“哦，是大学里的，一个我不认识的人。”拉里轻描淡写地说。

伊莎贝尔不懂他是什么意思，但他继续往下说着。

“有些话听上去挺幼稚的。大学的莘莘学子为这种知识兴奋不已，可是一走出校门就将其抛在了脑后，因为他们不得不挣钱养家。”

“这也无可厚非。你知道，我幸亏还有点钱可以过活。如若不然，我也得跟其他人一样去挣钱了。”

“难道钱对你一点都不重要吗？”

“是的。”他微微一笑说。

“你这样读书学习，还要多长时间？”

“说不准。大概要五年十年吧。”

“以后呢？你准备把学到的知识怎么运用？”

“如果掌握了知识，就有了智慧，到时候一定会知道如何运用的。”

伊莎贝尔情绪激动地把两只纤手绞在一起，坐在椅子上的身子朝前一探。

“你完全错了，拉里。你是个美国人，这儿不是你安身立命的地方。你安身立命的地方是美国。”

“等我学成了，我会回去的。”

“可是，你会错过很多机会。美国正在经历着一个世界从来没有经历过的伟大时代，你怎么能忍心坐在这死气沉沉的地方一动不动呢？欧洲已到了穷途末路。美利坚民族是世界上最伟大、最强盛的民族。我们正在一日千里地前进。在美国，一切条件都已具备。人人有义务投身于祖国的建设之中。你忘记了自己的义务，不知道如今在美国生活是多么激动人心。你不愿回国，是不是就是说你缺乏勇气去面对摆在每一个美国人面前的重任呢？哎，我知道你也在从事着某种工作，但这是否就是逃避责任的一种方式呢？这恐怕不仅仅是貌似勤奋的偷懒吧？如果人人都像你这样逃避责任，美国会弄成什么样子呢？”

“你很尖酸刻薄，小心肝。”他笑着说，“我的回答是，并不是每个人都和我有同样的感受。大多数人都准备按部就班地过日子，这对他们而言也许是幸运的。你忘记了一点，我的求知欲跟格雷挣大钱的欲望同样强烈。难道我想花几年时间进行深造，真的就是背叛祖国吗？也许我学成以后，会有自己的贡献，国人会感到高兴呢。当然，这只是一种假设。万一我功败垂成，也不见得就比经商失败的人差到哪里去。”

“那么我呢？难道我对你一点不重要？”

“你对我非常重要。我要娶你做新娘呢。”

“什么时候？十年之内吗？”

“不，现在。越快越好。”

“用什么结婚？妈妈是无法给我嫁妆的。即便她有这个能力，她也不会给的。她觉得纵容你游手好闲是错误的。”

“我并不想接受你母亲的任何帮助。”拉里说道，“我每年有三千块的进项，在巴黎生活绰绰有余。咱们可以租一小套公寓房，雇一个用人[40]，日子会过得很滋润的，小宝贝。”

“可是，拉里，一年三千块过日子是不够用的。”

“够用肯定是够用的。很多人钱比这还少，也能过日子。”

“可是，我不愿意靠一年三千块钱过日子。我没必要这样做。”

“我在这儿生活，只用这一半的花销。”

“可这叫什么日子！”

她看了看眼前寒碜的斗室，不屑地耸了耸肩。

“过这日子，我积攒了一些钱。咱们可以上卡普里岛[41]去度蜜月，秋天再去希腊。我渴望去看看希腊。还记得吗，咱们经常说要一起周游世界的？”

“旅游我当然是愿意去的，但并非这样的游法。乘轮船，我不愿住二等舱；住宿，我不愿下榻于三等旅馆，那儿连个浴室都没有；吃饭，我不愿进廉价饭馆。”

“去年十月，我游历意大利，恰恰就是这样去的，不是玩得也挺开心么。靠每年三千块的进项，咱们完全可以把世界跑个遍。”

“可是，我还想生孩子呢，拉里。”

“这没有关系。有了孩子，咱们带他们一起去旅游。”

“你真傻。”她大笑着说，“你知道有个孩子要花多少钱吗？维奥莱特·汤姆林森去年生了个孩子，尽量省着花，还花掉了两千五百块。你知道请个保姆需要多少钱吗？”她心里想到一连串的事情，越想越情绪激动，“你一点不实际，不知道你要求我过什么样的日子。我年轻，需要过快乐的生活。我想跟其他人一样寻求欢乐，去赴宴、跳舞，去打高尔夫球和骑马。我想穿漂亮的衣服。你能想象得来，一个女孩子家穿戴不如自己的同伴，心里该是什么样的滋味？把你朋友穿厌了的旧衣服买来穿，或者别人可怜你，把一件新衣服送给你，而你千恩万谢，拉里呀，你可知道这会叫你心里是什么滋味？那时我甚至于连去一家像样的理发店做做头发也做不起。我出行可不愿乘坐电车和公共汽车，而是想开自己的汽车。你在图书馆里看书，那你让我干什么以度过漫长的一天？难道让我逛马路、看橱窗，还是坐在卢森堡博物馆的花园里留心自己的孩子不要闯祸？那样生活，咱们连个朋友都不会有的。”

“请别这样，伊莎贝尔！”他打断她的话头说道。

“不会有我以前的那类朋友。哦，不错，艾略特舅舅的朋友有时候会看他的面子请请咱们，但咱们去不成，一是因为没有体面的衣服，二是由于咱们回请不起。至于交朋友，我可不愿意认识一大群穷了吧唧、衣衫不整的人。我跟他们无共同语言，他们也跟我无话可说。我需要的是真正的生活，拉里。”说到这里，她突然感到他眼睛里有种神情，虽一如既往地温情脉脉，却微微含有一丝嘲笑的成分，“你觉得我愚蠢，是不是？你一定觉得我鼠目寸光、蛮不讲理。”

“不，并非如此。我觉得你说这些话都是很自然的。”

此时，他背对着壁炉站着。她立起身，走到他跟前，和他面对着面。

“拉里，如果你身无分文，却有一个年收入三千块的工作，我会毫不迟疑地嫁给你。我会替你烧饭、收拾床铺，不在乎自己穿什么样的衣服，什么都不会在乎，就是苦也是苦中有乐，因为我知道这只是一个时间问题，你总会有出头之日的。可是，现在这样结婚，就意味着我一辈子要过这种肮脏的猪狗不如的日子，连个盼头都没有。这就是说，我要苦熬日月，至死方休。意义何在？而你成年累月为那种连你自己都说无法解答的问题苦苦寻找答案。这真是大错特错。一个男子汉，应该去工作。人生的意义就在于此。工作才能够造福于社会。”

“依你之见，我有责任立足于芝加哥，进入亨利·马图林的公司。你是不是认为，动员我的朋友买亨利·马图林所关心的股票，就是造福于社会呢？”

“经纪人的工作是社会所必需的，是一种十分体面、光彩的谋生方式。”

“你把巴黎普通收入人群的生活形容得一塌糊涂。人们用不着上沙诺尔式女装店，仍旧可以穿得体体面面。并非所有风趣的人都住在凯旋门附近和福煦大街。事实上，住在那儿的风趣的人少之又少，因为风趣的人一般都没有多少钱。我在这儿认识许多人，有画家、作家、大学生，有法国人、英国人、美国人，形形色色的。我敢肯定，见了面，你会觉得他们比艾略特的那些乏味的侯爵夫人和傲慢的公爵夫人有意思得多。你思想敏锐，而且富于幽默感。和他们共进晚餐，虽然喝的只是普通的葡萄酒[42]，又没有一个管家和几个侍从在跟前伺候，但听他们指点江山，你会感到是一种享受。”

“别东拉西扯的，拉里。我当然会喜欢的。你也知道我并不是个势利小人。我是愿意结交风趣的人的。”

“是呀。如果你穿一身沙诺尔式女装，他们会不会觉得你气势凌人，好像是来视察贫民窟的呢？他们不自在，你恐怕也会如坐针毡的。过后，你可以告诉你的闺密爱米丽·德·蒙塔杜尔和格拉茜·德·夏托加亚尔，说你在拉丁区结识了一群放荡不羁的文人，十分好玩，除此之外你将一无所获。”

伊莎贝尔听了微微耸了耸肩。

“我敢说你讲得对。他们不是我自小所熟悉的那种人。我跟他们毫无相同之处。”

“此话从何说起？”

“还是咱们开头讲的。自从记事起，我就一直住在芝加哥。我的朋友以及我所关心的一切全在那儿。在那儿，我感到心情舒坦。那儿就是我的根，也是你的根。妈妈患病在身，永无康复之日。我即便想离开她的身边，也是做不到的。”

“这是不是说除非我回到芝加哥去，否则你就不愿嫁给我了？”

伊莎贝尔犹豫了一下。她爱拉里，真心实意想嫁给他。她对他的爱是发自于肺腑之爱。她很清楚，拉里也爱她。她坚信，一旦摊牌，拉里会软下来的。她虽然心里也有担忧，但这个险是必须要冒的。

“是的，拉里，事情就是这样。”

他取出一根火柴——一根老式的法国造硫黄火柴，划着之后会叫你的鼻孔里充满呛人的味道。他把火柴在壁板上划亮，用它点着了烟斗。随即，他从她的身旁走过，来到了一扇窗户跟前，将目光投向外边。他沉默着，没完没了地沉默着。伊莎贝尔站在原地没动，仍站在刚才面对拉里的地方，眼睛望着壁炉板上的镜子，对镜中的自己却视而不见。她的心狂跳不已，焦虑得都快透不过气来了。最后，拉里终于转过了身来。

“真希望你能明白，我提供给你的生活要比你想象的充实得多。真希望能让你知道，精神生活是多么地激动人心，那会是多么丰富的人生经历。精神追求是永无止境的，是一种无比幸福的人生道路。只有一种体验能与之相比——你乘飞机飞上蓝天，越飞越高，越飞越高，周围什么都没有，只有无边无际的太空。无涯的空间让你为之陶醉。你会产生极度的欢乐——这种欢乐，哪怕把全世界所有的权力和荣誉都给你，你也不肯交换的。前几天我读笛卡儿的书，就有这种感觉。他写得是那样流畅、优美、明晰，叫人不忍释卷！”

“可是，拉里，”伊莎贝尔不顾一切地插话说，“难道你不知道，让我干自己不感兴趣也不想感兴趣的事情是强人所难？真不知我对你说过多少遍了，我仅仅是个再普通不过的女孩，今年二十岁，再过十年就变老了，我要抓紧时间及时行乐。拉里呀拉里，我是非常爱你的。可你现在的生活意义不大，不会使你有什么前途的。为了你的前途，我也要恳求你放弃眼前的生活。拉里，活着就应该像个男子汉，应该有所担当。别人都在只争朝夕地干事业，而你却在糟蹋宝贵的年华。拉里，你要是爱我的话，就不会为了一个梦想而置我于不顾。你已经按自己的意愿生活过一段时间了，求你跟我们一起回美国吧。”

“恕我不能，亲爱的。那会叫我生不如死，等于出卖我的灵魂。”

“哎，拉里，何必用那样的口吻讲话呢？只有歇斯底里、卖弄嘴皮子的文人才说如此慷慨激昂的话。这有什么意思呢？一点意思都没有，只是一派空言。”

“它反映的恰恰是我内心的感受。”他回话时，眨巴了几下眼睛。

“你怎么可以笑呢？你可曾意识到，这是一个极其严肃的问题？咱们正站在十字路口，何去何从将会影响你我的一生。”

“这我清楚。请相信我，我是十分认真的。”

伊莎贝尔不由叹了口气。

“假如你不听我讲道理，我也就无话可说了。”

“可我并不认为你在讲道理，而是一派荒谬绝伦的胡言乱语。”

“你在说我？”如果不是心境凄凉，她一定会哈哈大笑起来的。

“可怜的拉里呀，你简直太愚蠢了，蠢得百窍不通。”

她慢慢把订婚戒指从手指上摘下来，放在掌心，用眼睛盯着它看。戒指细细的，用白金打造，上面镶一粒四四方方的红宝石，她一直视若珍宝。

“你假如爱我，就不应当使我这样不快活。”

“我的确爱你。不幸的是，有时候一个人想要做自己认为对的事情，却免不了要使别人不快活。”

她把放着红宝石戒指的手伸出来，颤抖着嘴唇挤出了一个微笑。

“给，还给你吧，拉里。”

“我用不着。你留下它做个纪念，以纪念你我的友谊，好吗？你可以把它戴在小拇指上。咱们的友谊没必要因此而中断，是不是？”

“我会永远想着你的，拉里。”

“那你就留着它。我对你的感情永不会改变。”

她迟疑了一下，然后把戒指套在了右手的小拇指上。

“太大了。”

“你可以调整一下。走，咱们去里茨酒吧喝杯酒。”

“好的。”

她感到有点意外，没想到她和拉里的关系就这么轻轻松松结束了。她没有为之伤心落泪。除了她将来不会嫁给拉里之外，其他的什么都没有改变。她简直不敢相信他们的关系已结束，已画上了句号。二人没有吵得脸红脖子粗，这反倒叫她遗憾。他们心平气和地把他们的关系做了个了断，差不多就像谈论租房子那样声色不变。她虽然觉得有些失望，同时却也掺杂着一丝半点满意的心情，因为他们表现得都十分文明。她真想知道拉里究竟是一种什么心态。可是，要想猜透拉里葫芦里卖的是什么药，历来都是很难的。他那张淡定的脸以及那双乌黑的眼就是一副面具，即便她这么一个认识他多年的人也难看得穿。她本来把帽子已经摘掉，放在了床上；现在站在镜子前面，将帽子重新戴上。

“只是感到好奇，”她一边说话，一边用手理了理头发，“你是不是早就想解除婚约了？”

“没有。”

“我觉得这对你也许会是一种解脱。”见他没有回应，她嘴角带着一丝做作的微笑转过了身去，“我准备好了。”

拉里出门后将门锁上。他把钥匙交给桌子旁坐的那个人时，那人瞅了他们几眼，目光狡狯，显得心领神会。伊莎贝尔不可能猜不到他把他们看成了什么货色。

“我敢说那家伙对我的贞操存有满肚子的怀疑。”她说。

他们乘出租车去里茨喝了杯酒，谈些无关痛痒的事，表面上看无拘无束的，就像两个天天见面的老朋友。尽管拉里天生沉默寡言，伊莎贝尔却很健谈，叽叽喳喳把话说了一大篓子。她决心不让他们中间出现沉默的局面，弄得双方无话可说。她不想使拉里觉察出她恨他。自尊心使然，她必须强作欢颜，叫对方看不出她受伤、难过的心情。过了一会儿，她提出要他送她回去。当汽车把她送到门前，下车时，她以轻快的语气对他说：

“别忘了明天跟我们一起吃午饭。”

“就是天塌下来也不会忘的。”

她侧过脸，叫他吻了一下，然后就走进了旅馆的大门[43]。





五


伊莎贝尔走进客厅，看见有几个客人在那儿喝茶。有两个是住在巴黎的美国女子，穿着非常考究，脖子上挂着珍珠项链，手上戴着钻石手镯，手指上套着价值昂贵的戒指。虽然有一个的头发染成了深红褐色，另一个的头发呈金黄色，颜色很不自然，二者看上去却出奇地相像。她们的眼睫毛都重重地涂了眉毛油，嘴唇都搽得红艳艳，脸蛋上都抹了胭脂，都有着由于刻苦修行而保持着的苗条身段，均是五官清爽、有棱有角，眼睛一刻不停地滴溜溜乱转。你不由得会想到，她们在拼命地挣扎，竭力想挽留住正在逝去的风韵。她们嗓门大、声音尖，说话一点内涵都没有，如连珠炮一般不停顿，仿佛生怕一停下来体内的机器就会发生故障，而她们也会像房屋一样轰然倒塌。在场的还有一个美国大使馆的秘书，彬彬有礼、八面玲珑，一直没有开口，因为他压根就插不进去话。再有就是一个皮肤黝黑的小个子罗马尼亚王子，点头哈腰，一副殷勤相，一双黑黑的老鼠眼善于察言观色，黑不溜秋的脸刮得净光。他时不时会跳起身为他人奉茶、点烟、端点心，厚颜无耻地献媚，甜言蜜语，极尽阿谀奉承之能事。他如此小心翼翼地恭维，是为了报答对方请他赴宴的恩情，并希望今后能获得更多的邀请。

布雷德利夫人坐在茶桌旁。为了让艾略特高兴，她违背自己的心愿特意打扮了一番，此时履行着女主人的义务，神情似平时那般平静、礼貌、淡然。至于她如何看待弟弟的客人，我就不得而知了。我和她不太熟悉，而她是个不显山不露水的人。她并不缺心眼，在外国的首都生活了那么多年，形形色色的人见了不计其数，想来能够根据生她养她的那座弗吉尼亚小镇的标准对来客做出明智的判断。看见几位来客丑态百出，恐怕她心里一定觉得相当可笑。对于客人们的风情万种也罢，忸怩作态也罢，她全然不当回事，就跟对待小说里的人物一样——书中人的悲伤和痛苦引不起她的共鸣，因为她一开始就知道小说的结局是圆满的（否则她就不会去读它了）。巴黎、罗马、北京对她的美国味没有产生什么影响，这情形就跟艾略特虔诚的天主教信仰没有影响到她坚定不移地信仰长老会宗教一样。

伊莎贝尔以她的青春、活力和活泼可爱的形象给客厅里庸俗的环境带来了一股清新的气息。她姗姗而至，犹如一个下凡的仙女。罗马尼亚王子慌不迭地站起来替她拉过一把椅子，手忙脚乱地向她献殷勤。两个美国女人尖着嗓子说了些亲热的话，把她从头到脚打量一番，观察着她穿戴的细微之处，面对她那生气勃勃的青春，心中也许产生了几分落寞。美国外交官看见伊莎贝尔的出现叫这两个女人显得姿态做作和面容憔悴，不由暗中一笑。可是，伊莎贝尔却觉得她们雍容华贵；她喜欢她们的华装丽服和昂贵的珍珠，而且还对她们的矫揉造作感到了一丝妒意。她不知道自己将来是不是也能够拥有如此仪态万方的风度。当然，那位小个子罗马尼亚人相当可笑，不过待人倒是挺殷勤的，就算他讲的那些好听的话言不由衷，听听也叫人高兴。她进来时打断的谈话现在又恢复了，而且说话人都是那么兴致勃勃，那样的自信笃定，好像她们谈的事情都是有价值的，让你会以为她们的谈吐富于理性。其谈话内容无非是她们参加过什么宴会，以及预备参加什么宴会。对于近来出现的花边新闻，她们津津乐道。她们把自己的朋友说得一无是处。谈到那些名人大姓，她们如数家珍。她们好像无人不晓，谁家的秘密都逃不过她们的眼睛。她们几乎可以一口气讲出一大堆爆料，有最时新的剧目、刚走红的服装设计师、最近才火起来的肖像画家、刚上台的首相才勾搭上的情妇。你会觉得天下没有她们不知道的事情。听得伊莎贝尔如痴如醉。她觉得，一切都是那样美妙和文明。这才是真正的生活，置身于其中给她一种心旷神怡的感觉。眼前的情景是真实的存在，眼前的环境完美无缺——房间宽敞，脚下铺着萨冯内里埃地毯，华美的镶板墙上挂着漂亮的画作，一把把座椅都是精雕细镂的作品，小柜子和茶几均为价钱不菲的镶嵌细工活，每一样东西都是精品，简直可以放在博物馆里展览。布置这个房间，一定花钱不少，但这笔钱花得值得。她以前从未注意到这儿竟如此美丽，品味如此高——拉里自称没有什么不好的旅馆里的那个寒碜的小房间，那儿的铁床和拉里坐的那把硬邦邦、别别扭扭的椅子，都还活跃在她的脑海里，形象是那样鲜明。拉里的房间空空如也，没有欢乐，只有悲哀，想起来就叫她不寒而栗。

客人散了，只剩下了伊莎贝尔、她母亲以及艾略特三个人。

“真是叫人着迷的女人。”艾略特把那两个涂脂抹粉的可怜蛋送到大门外之后，返回来说了这么一句，“她们刚来巴黎时，我就认识她们了。做梦也想不到她们竟有这般脱胎换骨的变化。咱们国家的女人之适应能力实在叫人惊叹。你简直看不出她们是美国人，而且是中西部来的。”

布雷德利夫人抬起眼，什么话也没说，只是瞅了瞅弟弟。对方善于察言观色，哪能不晓得姐姐的意思。

“可怜的路易莎，这你恐怕是做不到的。”他半讥讽半亲热地说，“不过，老天爷知道，你在过去完全有这个能力。”

布雷德利夫人听后噘了噘嘴。

“恐怕我让你觉得又失望又丢人，艾略特。不过，实话告诉你，我对自己现在的样子十分满意。”

“悉听尊便。”艾略特叽里咕噜来了一句法语。

“我跟拉里解除婚约了，我觉得应该告诉你们一声。”伊莎贝尔说道。

“啊？”艾略特叫出了声，“这给我明天请的午宴出了个难题。这么短的时间，你叫我去哪儿找人补他的缺？”

“哦，午宴他还是要来的。”

“解除了婚约他还来？这好像跟一般人的做法不太相同。”

伊莎贝尔咯咯笑了。她把目光聚焦在艾略特舅舅身上，因为她知道母亲在盯着她看，而她不想去直视母亲。

“我们没有吵架。今天下午我们俩谈了谈心，最后都觉得我们的婚约是个错误。他不想回美国，而是想留在巴黎，还说要到希腊去。”

“这是为什么？雅典可不是从事社交活动的好地方。事实上，我对希腊艺术从来就不大看在眼里。有些古希腊的艺术品倒是有那么一点颓废的魅力，还是可以吸引人眼球的。然而要说菲狄亚斯[44]的作品——看不得，看不得。”

“你看着我，伊莎贝尔！”布雷德利夫人说。

伊莎贝尔转过头来，唇边挂着淡淡的微笑，把脸朝向母亲。布雷德利夫人将她打量一番，最后什么也没说，只是哼了一声。布雷德利夫人看得出她没有哭过，神态安然、宁静。

“我觉得你解除婚约算是做对了，伊莎贝尔。”艾略特说，“我原本觉得也就凑合着吧，可心里总认为不是一桩美满的婚配。老实讲，他配不上你。看他在巴黎的所作所为就已经很清楚，他绝对不会有大的出息。凭你的容貌和社会关系，完全可以找一个比他强的对象。我认为这件事你处理得很有分寸。”

布雷德利夫人看了一眼女儿，眼神里有几分担忧。

“你不是为了我才这么做的吧，伊莎贝尔？”

伊莎贝尔断然摇了摇头。

“不，亲爱的妈妈，我这样做完全是出于我自己的原因。”





六


此时，我已从东方返回伦敦，准备在伦敦住一住。上述事件发生后大概有两个星期吧，一天上午艾略特打来了电话。听见他的声音，我并不感到奇怪，因为他有个习惯，总爱在交际季节落幕时来英国游一趟。他告诉我，布雷德利夫人和伊莎贝尔与他一起来了，说如果我傍晚六点钟能去他那儿喝杯酒，她们见到我一定会很高兴的。他们一家当然住的是克拉里奇酒店了。我下榻的地方离那儿不远，于是我便以步代车朝那儿走，先是漫步于公园巷，然后穿过梅菲尔区[45]那一条条静谧、高贵的街道，一直走到克拉里奇酒店。艾略特住的还是平时住过的那套房间，墙上镶着褐色壁板，壁板的材质跟雪茄盒的一样，陈设既典雅又豪华。服务生把我领进去时，房间里只有他一个人，布雷德利夫人和伊莎贝尔出去购物了，但是也快回来了。他把伊莎贝尔和拉里解除婚约的事情告诉了我。

对于如何行为、如何处世，艾略特自有一套看法，一套既浪漫又十分传统的看法。这俩年轻人的做法叫他颇为不安。解除婚约后的第二天，拉里不但照样来赴午宴，还没事人似的，就好像他的地位并没有改变。他仍像往常那样和颜悦色、彬彬有礼，还是那样安静和快活。对待伊莎贝尔，他也是一如既往，仍是那般遗情缱绻。他似乎没有感到落魄，没有情绪低落，也没有哀伤。伊莎贝尔亦没有精神低迷的迹象，而是一脸的快活，笑声朗朗，高高兴兴地插科打诨，仿佛并不曾刚刚做出了一项有关自己一生的重大、痛切的决定。艾略特如坠五里雾中，一下子摸不着头脑了。那俩年轻人说话的只言片语传进了他的耳朵，于是他得知他们无意取消以前商量好的约会。他瞅了个机会，把此事和姐姐谈了谈。

“这不成体统。”他说，“他们不能够仍旧像订婚一样，一块儿到处跑，拉里真的应该懂得一点进退。再说，这样会毁掉伊莎贝尔的机会。福瑟林厄姆，就是英国大使馆的那个小伙子很明显看上了伊莎贝尔，他可是既有钱又有社会地位。假如他知道伊莎贝尔解除了婚约，并向她伸出橄榄枝，那我一点都不会感到奇怪。依我看，你应该跟伊莎贝尔好好谈谈。”

“亲爱的，伊莎贝尔是二十岁的人了，她有套办法能够委婉地告诉你不要管她的事情。这使我一直很难对付。”

“那么，就都怪你管教太不得当了，路易莎。话又说回来，她的终身大事也是你分内的事。”

“在这一点上，你和她有着明显的分歧。”

“你简直叫我无法容忍，路易莎。”

“我可怜的艾略特，假如你有个已经长大成人的女儿，你会发现她比一匹乱尥蹶子的小马还难管。你还想知道她心里是怎么想的……算了吧，还是装糊涂的好，装作一个头脑简单、什么都不懂的老糊涂虫——你在她眼里八成就是这么个样子。”

“可你不是跟她谈过这件事了么？”

“我打算谈来着。她却冲我哈哈大笑，说实在没有什么可谈的。”

“她难过吗？”

“我也不知道，只知道她吃饭吃得香，睡觉也睡得香，睡起觉就像个小孩子一样。”

“哼，你记住我的话，如果你听任他们这样继续下去，总有一天他们会溜掉，招呼也不打就结婚的。”

布雷德利夫人忍不住笑了。

“你尽管可以放心——他们现在在这么一个国家里呢，不正常的男女关系有着种种方便，结婚却会遇到重重障碍。”

“这没什么不好的。结婚是严肃的事情，关乎家庭的安全和国家的稳定。婚外情不仅要容忍，还应该得到认可，唯有如此，才能保障婚姻的威严。嫖娼卖淫嘛，我可怜的路易莎……”

“够啦，艾略特！”布雷德利夫人打断了他的话，“你对不正常男女关系的社会价值和道德价值所发表的奇谈怪论我不感兴趣。”

就在这时，艾略特提出了一项计划，可以切断伊莎贝尔和拉里藕断丝连的关系——这种关系叫他厌恶，不符合他的人生观。巴黎的社交季节已接近尾声。上流社会的人们都在准备到海滨度假地去，或者到多维尔[46]去，然后各自回祖传的城堡消夏——那些城堡分布于都兰、安茹或者布列塔尼。艾略特通常都是在六月底去伦敦的，可是由于他的家庭观念很强，对姐姐以及伊莎贝尔的感情又是那么诚挚，所以他准备牺牲自己的利益，就是在有头有脸的人都走光的情况下，只要姐姐她们俩想留在巴黎，他也会留下相陪。不过，他发现了一种两全其美的途径，既能够为他人考虑，又方便了自己。他向布雷德利夫人建议，他们三人应该立刻启程到伦敦去。那儿的社交季节正处在高潮，可以参加新的有趣的活动，结交新的朋友，这会转移伊莎贝尔的注意力，使她不再去想她那不幸的遭遇。根据报纸上的报道，专治布雷德利夫人这种病的那位出了名的医生恰好正在英国的首都，找他治病可以成为他们匆匆离开巴黎的一种合理的说法，即便伊莎贝尔不情愿，也会说不出口的。布雷德利夫人同意了这个计划。伊莎贝尔的表现叫她感到困惑。她实在弄不清自己的女儿，不知女儿是不是真的像表面那样一点不在乎，还是心里痛苦、气愤或者伤心，却装出一副英雄相，把打掉的牙往肚子里咽。她只能同意艾略特的说法——结识新的人，游历新的地方，对伊莎贝尔自有好处。

接下来，艾略特打了一通电话。此时的伊莎贝尔正和拉里一同逛凡尔赛宫。等到她回来，艾略特把情况告诉了她，说他已经约好带她的母亲去那位名医处看病，约定的时间是三天后，还说在克拉里奇酒店已订好了房间，他们一家后天便要启程到伦敦去。当艾略特颇有得色地给伊莎贝尔讲述出行计划时，布雷德利夫人留意观察女儿的反应，却见她神色不动。

“啊，亲爱的妈妈，很高兴你能够去找那个医生看病。”伊莎贝尔说道，语调仍像往常那样急火火的，像喘不过气似的，“这个机会当然是不容错过的。到伦敦去一定是段非凡的经历。在那儿待多长时间呢？”

“急着返回巴黎是毫无意义的，”艾略特说，“因为一个星期之内，这里的人都要走光了。我要你们跟我在克拉里奇酒店住完这个社交季节。七月份总会有些别开生面的舞会的，当然还有温布尔登网球公开赛喽。之后，还有古德伍德公园附近举行的赛马会和考斯的赛船。我敢说，埃林厄姆家一定会欢迎咱们坐他们的游艇去考斯看赛船的，而班托克家历来都会在古德伍德赛马时举办一场规模宏大的宴会。”

伊莎贝尔看上去很高兴，布雷德利夫人这才松了口气。伊莎贝尔好像根本没有把拉里往心里放。

艾略特刚给我把情况介绍完，那一对母女就回来了。没见她们的面，已经有超过一年半的时间了。布雷德利夫人比以前瘦了些，脸色也比以前苍白了，倦容满面，气色极差。而伊莎贝尔却容光焕发，脸蛋红扑扑的，一头深褐色的头发，淡褐色的眼睛神采奕奕，肤如凝脂，给人以青春荡漾的印象，乐乐呵呵的，好像活着就是一种幸福。看到她，你心里会不由得充满喜悦，笑出声来。我甚至产生了一个十分荒唐的想法，觉得她就像一枚金黄的熟透了的梨子，香甜可口，只等你来吃呢。她身上散发出阵阵暖意，让你觉得只要伸出手就能感受到温馨。与上次见到她时相比，她看上去高了些，不知道是因为穿了高跟鞋的缘故，还是因为那个聪明的裁缝把她的衣服裁剪得好，遮住了她年轻丰满的躯体，使她的个头显高了些。她的一举一动都显示出自小便习惯于户外运动的女孩子的那种潇洒自如。总之，从性的角度看，她已经出落成了一个非常诱人的年轻女子。我要是她母亲的话，会认为她已经到嫁人的时候了。

我很高兴现在有了机会，总算可以稍稍报答一下布雷德利夫人对我的招待了。我邀请他们三个晚上一块儿去看戏，还为他们三人安排了一次午宴。

“干得好，你约的正是时候，亲爱的老伙计。”艾略特说，“我已经通知了一些朋友，说我们到了伦敦。一两天之内，这个季节我们的日程恐怕就会被排得满满的了。”

听他的话音，像是说他们没有时间陪我这样的人。我只好付之一笑。艾略特看了我一眼，眼神里带着几分傲慢。

“不过，我们每天下午六点钟左右一般都在酒店里，你来我们会很高兴的。”他说话的语气很委婉，意思却很明确——我只不过是个小作家，地位低下。

殊不知兔子急了也会咬人的。

“你应该和圣奥尔弗德家联系一下，”我话中有话地说，“听说他们想卖掉家中的那幅康斯特布尔[47]画的《索尔兹伯里大教堂[48]》。”

“我眼下不想买什么画。”

“这我知道，但我觉得你可以帮他们处理掉嘛。”

艾略特的眼睛里透出了一丝冷冷的光。

“亲爱的老伙计，英国人是一个伟大的民族，可是他们没有绘画的天赋，永远也不会有的。我对英国画派不感兴趣。”





七


这以后的四个星期中，我很少见到艾略特和布雷德利夫人母女。他带着她们四处亮相，去苏塞克斯郡的一个大户人家度一个周末，再到威尔特郡一户更气派的人家过上一个周末。他还带她们坐在皇家包厢作为温莎王室一个年轻公主的客人看歌剧；带她们和大人物们一起共进午餐和晚餐。伊莎贝尔参加了好几次舞会。他在克拉里奇酒店款待了一批批的客人，那些人的名字次日便出现在了报纸上显眼的位置。他还在吉罗酒店和使馆大设晚宴招待四方贵宾。事实上，他为了让伊莎贝尔高兴，该做的都做了——如果是一个涉世不太深的女孩，见了这纸醉金迷、高贵典雅的场面，免不了要感到眼花缭乱的。他可以自诩说他没有一点私心，费尽千辛万苦全都是为了伊莎贝尔，想让她忘掉爱情上的不幸。可我觉得他恐怕别有一番用意，是想让姐姐亲眼看看他跟那些地位高贵的人以及炙手可热的人关系是多么熟稔，从中获得巨大的满足感。他在待人接客方面可称可赞，热衷于展现自己的交际手腕。

他举办的宴会我去参加过一两次，也时常在下午六点钟的时候去克拉里奇酒店他们的房间里坐坐。我发现伊莎贝尔身边老围着一群小伙子，有身材魁梧、衣着漂亮的御林军军官，也有文质彬彬、衣着不太漂亮的外交部官员。一次这样的场合，伊莎贝尔把我拉到了一边。

“我想问你点事。”她说，“你可记得那天傍晚咱们俩去药店喝冰淇淋苏打水的事吗？”

“记得清清楚楚。”

“那次你对我很好，对我很有帮助。能不能再帮我一次呢？”

“愿意效力。”

“我想和你说点事。咱们哪天一起吃顿午饭好吗？”

“你说哪一天都行。”

“找个清静一点的地方。”

“乘车到汉普顿宫，在那儿吃午饭怎么样？花园里正是花开得盛的时候，还可以参观一下伊丽莎白女王的寝室。”

我的建议很合乎她的心意，于是我们约定了日期。可是到了那一天，本来晴暖的天气突然变了脸，空中阴云密布，淅淅沥沥下起了小雨。我打电话给她，问她愿意不愿意在城里吃饭。

“这下子，咱们没法坐在花园里聊天了，室内也黑乎乎的，那些画是看不清的。”我说道。

“花园我去得多了，大师的名画我也看腻烦了。还是按计划去吧。”

“那好吧。”

我去接她，然后我们就乘汽车走了。我知道一家小旅馆，里边提供的饭菜还可以，于是我们便直接去了那里。路上，伊莎贝尔跟平时一样健谈，讲述着她所参加过的宴会以及所遇到的人。她玩得很开心。可是，她对自己所结交的形形色色的人却缺乏好评，认为他们荒唐可笑，这让我觉得她有主见、眼光独到。下雨天，餐厅里没人，只有我们两个吃客。这家旅馆以家常的英国菜最拿手，所以我们点了一块好羊腿，配菜是绿豌豆和新马铃薯，还有用深盘子烘焙的苹果馅饼，上面抹一些德文郡奶油。我们还喝了一大杯啤酒，叫这顿午餐颇显丰盛。饭后，我建议去空咖啡室坐坐，那儿有扶手椅，比较舒服。咖啡室里寒气袭人，不过壁炉里有煤和木柴，于是我擦一根火柴将其点着。火焰让这个阴冷的房间有了宜人的生气。

“言归正传吧，”我说，“把你想对我说的话讲一讲吧。”

“要说的跟上次一样，”她笑嘻嘻地说，“还是拉里。”

“我猜就是这样的。”

“你一定也知道我们解除了婚约。”

“艾略特跟我讲了。”

“妈妈松了口气，而舅舅十分开心。”

说到这里，她犹豫了一下，然后就切入正题，把她和拉里的那场谈话讲述了一遍。关于那场谈话，我已向读者进行了如实的陈述。读者也许会感到奇怪：她为什么会向一个自己了解不深的人倾吐心事呢？我见她也只不过有十来次，除了药店的那次接触，我们从未单独交谈过。其实，我对此并不感到意外。就这一点而论，恐怕所有的作家都有体会——人们不愿随便吐露心事，却愿意向作家敞开心扉。原因不得而知。也许是他们看了某个作家的一两本书，便觉得跟他亲密无间了，要不就是他们将自己戏剧化了，自认为是小说里的主人公，因此愿意像他杜撰的那些人物一样对他推心置腹。还有，我觉得伊莎贝尔认为我喜欢拉里和她，认为他们的青春令我动了恻隐之心，同情他们不幸的境况。她不能指望艾略特有耐心听她倾诉。拉里有过步入社会的绝佳机会，却被他白白放弃了——对于这样的一个年轻人，艾略特是不愿浪费自己的时间的。她母亲也帮助不了她。布雷德利夫人有着自己的处世原则和做事标准。根据她的做事标准，一个人要想在这个世界站住脚跟，就应该按常规行事，而非拒绝听别人的劝告，去做一些不牢靠的事情。她的处世原则使她坚信：一个男人有责任去一家公司工作，靠自身的聪明才智积累一笔财富，按照符合自己地位的生活标准养家糊口，使儿子们受到适当教育，让他们长大后能体面地生活，自己死后能叫妻子过上衣食无忧的日子。

伊莎贝尔记性好，把那次长谈中的许多细节都记得一清二楚。我默默地听她娓娓道来，一直听到最后。中间，她仅仅中断了一次，问了我一个问题。

“勒伊斯达尔是什么人？”

“勒伊斯达尔？他是荷兰的一个风景画家。怎么啦？”

她说拉里在谈话中提到了此人。根据拉里的说法，勒伊斯达尔至少对他关心的问题找到了一个答案。当时，伊莎贝尔曾问此人是谁，拉里的回答却轻描淡写。伊莎贝尔把拉里的回答对我重复了一遍。

“你觉得他是什么意思呢？”

我忽然若有所悟。

“你看他会不会说的是鲁斯布鲁克？”

“也许是吧。他是什么人？”

“是一个生活在十四世纪的佛兰芒神秘主义者。”

“噢，原来如此。”伊莎贝尔有点失望地说。

这一细节对伊莎贝尔倒没有什么，对我却有所启示。我总算找到了一点线索，有益于把握拉里的思想脉络。我一边注意听她讲述，一边琢磨着拉里提及此人究竟意味着什么。我不愿过度解读此事，因为拉里当时提到那位狂热的精神导师，很可能仅仅是借他以引证自己的观点。也许其中自有深意，伊莎贝尔没听出来罢了。拉里回答她的提问时，说鲁斯布鲁克是学校里的一个人，他并不认识，这显然是不想叫伊莎贝尔再追问下去。

“此事你怎么看？”伊莎贝尔讲述完之后问我。

我想了想，然后才说道：

“你还记得他说过自己要逛大街吗？假如告诉你的那些话属实，那么，这种‘逛大街’就是漫长而艰苦的过程了。”

“我敢肯定他说的是实话。但你不觉得他如果把这么大的精力都花在有意义的工作上，就能有可观的收入吗？”

“有些人生性就是那样古怪。一些罪犯苦心经营，机关算尽，结果锒铛入狱，可一出来他们又故态复萌，到头来还是吃牢饭。以他们的勤奋、聪明、意志和耐心，如果干正当的营生，完全可以招财进宝，在社会上占据重要的位置。可是，江山易改，本性难移。他们就喜欢作奸犯科。”

“可怜的拉里。”她咯咯笑了起来，“你不是在说他学习希腊语，目的是为了抢银行吧？”

我也笑了。

“不，我不是这个意思。我是想说有些人做事像走火入魔，不能够自已，不达目的誓不罢休。为了满足内心的渴望，他们什么都可以牺牲。”

“连爱他们的人都可以拿来作为牺牲品？”

“哦，是这么回事。”

“这不明明是自私的表现嘛。除此之外，还会是什么呢？”

“我也弄不清。”我笑笑说。

“拉里学习僵死的语言能有什么用处？”

“有些人追求知识没有功利目的。说来这种欲望也没什么可指责的。”

“学了知识却不打算利用，那有什么意义呢？”

“他的情况也许就是这样的。学习知识也许仅仅是为了心理上的满足，就跟艺术家能创造一件艺术品而感到心里充实一样。或者将其视为阶梯，以后谋求长足的发展。”

“如果他渴望追求知识，那他从战场归来时，为什么不上大学呢？纳尔逊医生和我妈妈就是这样劝他的。”

“我在芝加哥时跟他谈过。学位对他没有用处。我有一种感觉，认为他对自己的目标是胸有成竹的，他觉得上大学实现不了自己的目标。要知道，在求知的道路上，有独行者，也有结伴而行的人。我认为拉里这种人宁愿走自己的独木桥，也不愿走别人的阳光道。”

“记得有一次我问他想不想写作。他付之一笑，说他没有素材可写。”

“若论不情愿写作，那是我所听到过的最站不住脚的理由。”我笑了笑说。

伊莎贝尔动了动身子，显得有点不耐烦。她没心听我说笑，哪怕是最轻松的调侃也不愿听。

“他成了今天这种样子，实在叫人费解。战争爆发前，他跟别的人是没有什么两样的。说出来你也不会相信——他网球打得很好，打高尔夫球也是一把好手。大家干什么，他也干什么，完全是个很正常的孩子。那样的孩子将来不可能不成长为一个正正常常的男子汉。你是个小说家嘛，应该能够解释得清楚。”

“人性极其复杂，我才疏学浅，怎么能解释得清呢？”

“今天我约你来，就是想听听你的见解。”她没理会我的话，自顾自地说道。

“你是不是感到不开心？”

“不，不能说是不开心。拉里不在跟前，我也挺好的。和他在一起，我老觉得自己很软弱。现在我只感到有些不舒服，就好像数月没骑马，这次却骑马跑了很远的路，浑身发硬。这不是那种疼痛感，也并非忍受不了，但是却在折磨着你。我终究会挺过去的。我所无法容忍的是，拉里把他的生活搞得一团糟。”

“也许并非如此。他踏上了一条漫长、艰辛的道路，踽踽而行，但最终他会找到自己所追求的东西的。”

“那是什么呢？”

“你难道没有想到过？从他告诉你的那些话看来，他的意思已经很明显了。他要找的是上帝。”

“上帝！”她叫出了声。可是，她这一句是惊叹语，表达的是意外和难以相信的心情。我们用了同一字眼，但是，意义却完全两样，因此而产生了一种喜剧效果，使得我们都笑了起来。但是，伊莎贝尔立刻又严肃起来。我觉得她的整个表情里带有一种恐惧。“你怎么会想到这个？”

“我只是猜想罢了。你不是要我谈谈自己作为一个小说家的看法嘛。可惜你并不了解，在战争中究竟是什么样的经历深深触动了他。我认为他是突然经受了某种打击，一种出乎他意料之外的打击。依我看，不管他发生了什么事情，反正他因此而感到人生无常，也因此而感到痛苦。他相信总会有一种救世良方，使这个世界摆脱罪恶和痛苦。”

我看得出伊莎贝尔不喜欢我把话头转到这上面，这使得她忐忑不安。

“这恐怕有点太不正常了吧？应该以现实的眼光看待问题才对。既然来到这个世上，就应该想着把日子过好。”

“也许你是对的。”

“老实说，我只是一个普通女孩，一个再普通不过的女孩。我只想把日子过得开心一些。”

“看来你们俩在性情上完全不般配。在结婚之前能发现这一点是非常好的。”

“我想结婚生孩子，生活得……”

“仁慈的上帝很高兴为你安排这样的生活。”我打断她的话，笑着说道。

“哦，这样的生活没有什么不好的，是不是？这是一种愉快的生活，叫我心满意足。”

“你们就像两个朋友要一起去度假期，可是，一个要爬格陵兰的雪山，另一个要到印度的珊瑚礁上去钓鱼。这显然是行不通的。”

“不管怎么说，我去格陵兰爬雪山，说不定能获得一件海豹皮大衣，至于在印度的珊瑚礁上能不能钓到鱼，恐怕就很值得怀疑了。”

“那得等着看了。”

“你为什么这样说呢？”她微微皱了皱眉头问道，“一直以来，你好像说话喜欢留半句。我当然心里有数，知道自己并非唱主角的。唱主角的是拉里。他是个理想主义者，怀揣最美丽的梦想，即便是空梦一场，也会叫追梦人心旷神怡。我的角色是个唯利是图、庸俗不堪的小人。人们一般是不会同情这种人的，对不对？但请别忘了，吃亏的是我。拉里会昂首前行，梦游彩云间，让我跟在后边苦熬岁月。我所需要的是正常的生活。”

“我哪能忘了呢。多年前，当我还年轻的时候，我认识一个医生，医术不错，但他并不开业行医，却经年泡在大英博物馆的图书馆里，隔上一段时间就写出一本厚书来，既不像科学书也不像哲学书，由于没人看，只好自费印刷。离开人世之前，他写了四五本这样的书，没有任何价值。他有个儿子想进军界，可他没有钱送儿子进桑赫斯特军事学院学习，那孩子只好报名入伍，后来战死于疆场。他还有个女儿，长得很漂亮，叫我很是着迷。她是个演戏的，却没有演戏的天赋，只好跟着二流剧团跑江湖，在戏里边演演配角，挣的钱少得可怜。他的妻子操劳多年，干的是牛马活，身体完全崩溃了，女儿只好回家照料她，代替她做她已无力支撑的繁重的家务活。这样的日子苦难接连不断，浪费了大好光阴，最后一无所得。当你决定偏离众人所走的道路，另辟蹊径时，就等于是一场赌博。标新立异者为数不少，成功者寥寥无几。”

“我的决定，妈妈和艾略特舅舅是赞成的。你呢？”

“亲爱的，我怎么看对你有什么关系呢？我对你几乎可以说是个陌生的人。”

“我把你看作是一个不偏不倚的观察者。”她嫣然一笑说，“我还是想得到你的认可的。你觉得我这样做对不对？”

“为了你自己，你算是做对了。”我回答时，深信她不会听出我话中有话。

“那我为什么总觉得良心不安呢？”

“是吗？”

她点点头。她嘴边仍挂着微笑，但那微笑中含着几分悲伤。

“我知道这是合乎常理的。任何有理性的人，都会认为这是我唯一可行的路。不管是从实际情况的角度看，从人情世故的角度看，从道德规范的角度看，抑或是以是非的标准衡量，我的决定都是理所应当的。然而，在我的内心深处，我却有一种惴惴不安的感觉，觉得我如果对拉里好一些，少几分斤斤计较，少几分自私，多一些高尚，我就会和他结婚，过他的那种生活。如果我真的爱他，就会淡视世俗利益。”

“也可以把话倒过来说——如果他真的爱你，他就会毫不犹豫地按你的意思行事了。”

“我也这么想过。可这是行不通的。我觉得与男性相比，女性天生更富于自我牺牲的精神。”她说完嘻嘻一笑，“就像路得到异乡谋生时那样[49]。”

“那你为什么不试一下呢？”

我们的谈话一直是在很轻松的气氛中进行的，语气随随便便的，仿佛在谈论一个双方都认识的熟人，却对那个熟人并不是特别关心在意。伊莎贝尔甚至在向我陈述她跟拉里的那次谈话时，也显得乐呵呵的，时不时还加一些幽默的话语进去，就好像并不想让我把她的话太当真似的。可是现在听我这么一问，她的脸色变了。

“我怕呀。”

我们俩沉默了一会儿，谁都没有吱声。我的脊梁骨起了一阵凉意——每当遇到深刻、真实的感情问题时，我都会有这种奇怪的反应。我觉得这是一个可怕的时刻，一个震撼灵魂的时刻。

“你非常爱他吗？”末了，我问了她这么一句。

“我不知道。我对他很不耐烦，生他的气，但是却渴望和他在一起。”

说到这里，我们又沉默了下来。我真不知道再说什么好。

我们坐的咖啡室面积很小，厚厚的花边窗帘遮住了外面的光线。墙上糊着黄颜色的大理石花纹壁纸，挂着几幅陈旧的游猎图。再加上几件红木家具、寒碜的皮椅和一股霉味，会叫人莫名其妙地联想到狄更斯小说里的咖啡室。我用拨火棍拨了拨壁炉里的火，又添了些煤。这时，伊莎贝尔突然开了口。

“当时，我以为向他摊了牌，他就会服输，因为我知道他是很软弱的。”

“软弱？”我叫出了声，“你怎么会有这种想法？他这种人一旦决定走自己的路，就会义无反顾，根本不理会亲友的反对之声。”

“过去只要我叫他做什么，他就做什么。我能够轻而易举地指挥他。不管干什么事情，他都屈居别人之下，跟在别人的后边转。”

我点着一根烟，吐了个烟圈，看着那烟圈越变越大，最后消失在空气里。

“妈妈和艾略特舅舅认为我绝对不该在解除婚约后还跟着他到处乱跑，像没事人似的。而我觉得这并没有什么大不了的。我一直心怀希望，指望着拉里最终会服输。我不相信，当他那死脑袋瓜意识到我讲的话算数时，他会不让步。”说到此处，她停顿了一下，然后冲我一笑，样子又顽皮又狡黠，“我告诉你一件事情，你不会感到吃惊吧？”

“我想不会的。”

“在我们决定来伦敦之后，我去见了拉里，请他和我一道度过在巴黎的最后一个晚上。当我把此事告诉家里人时，艾略特舅舅说这非常不得体，妈妈则说没这个必要，意思就是她完全不赞成。艾略特舅舅问我究竟想干什么，我说只不过和拉里在一起吃顿饭，然后去夜总会看看。他建议妈妈禁止我去。于是妈妈对我说：‘如果我禁止你去，你会听吗？’我回答说：‘亲爱的妈妈，我不会听的。’她接下来说：‘我猜着你就不会听。既然如此，我禁止你去，好像意义就不大了。’”

“你母亲像是个很有头脑的人。”

“我敢说很少有事情能逃过她的眼睛。拉里来接我时，我到她房间里跟她说再见。当时，我稍微打扮了一下。你知道，在巴黎非得如此不可，不然的话看上去就像光着身子。她看见我身上穿的那身衣服时，把我从头到脚扫了几眼，弄得我局促不安。我怀疑她有一双慧眼，看穿了我的心思。不过，她什么也没有说，只是吻了我一下，说她希望我玩得开心。”

“你有什么心思？”

伊莎贝尔迟疑地望着我，好像决定不了是不是对我应该再坦诚一些。

“我当时感到自己看上去还是挺不错的，觉得那是我的最后一次机会了。拉里在马克西姆饭店预订了一张桌子。我们大快朵颐，吃了很多美味，都是我特别喜欢吃的，还喝了香槟酒。我们海阔天空地谈着——至少我是这样的，引得拉里哈哈大笑。我就喜欢他这一点——一听我说话，他就开心得不得了。然后，我们俩就跳舞，跳够了便跑到马德里堡玩。在那儿碰见几个熟人，大家一起碰杯把盏，喝了些香槟酒。后来，我们又去了金合欢歌舞厅。拉里的舞跳得很棒，我们俩配合默契。大厅里很热，再加上音乐声和酒劲，我感到晕晕乎乎的，心里有些躁动不安。跳舞时，我和拉里脸贴着脸。我知道他想得到我。老天爷清楚，我也想得到他。我心生一计。其实那种想法早就藏在我的心里了。我觉得应该带他回酒店。到了那里，就不可避免地会出现一些插曲。”

“我敢肯定，你这样说是很含蓄的了。”

“我的房间距离艾略特舅舅的房间以及妈妈的房间都隔着一段路，因此我认为没有危险。等我们回到美国之后，我想我可以写信告诉拉里，就说我怀孕了。那时他就只好回去和我结婚了。我敢说把他留在美国并不难，特别是有妈妈患病在身这个理由。我当时心里嘀咕：‘我真蠢，怎么以前没想到这一计。这样一来，所有的问题都会迎刃而解的。’在歌舞厅里，音乐停下来时，我仍依偎在他的怀里。后来我说时间晚了，明天中午我们还要赶火车呢，最好回去吧。我们坐进了一辆出租车。我紧靠在他身上，他用胳膊搂紧我，吻了吻我。他吻了又吻，吻了又吻——啊，那感觉真好。好像没多大一会儿，出租车就停在了酒店门前。拉里付了车费。这时只听他说：‘等会儿我走路回去。’汽车绝尘而去，我伸出胳膊搂紧他的脖子说：‘进去再喝一杯怎么样？’他回答说：‘恭敬不如从命。’他揿了门铃，大门打开了。待我们进了大厅，他把电灯扭亮。我看看他的眼睛——那双眼睛充满了信任，那样诚实，那样天真无邪。显而易见，他丝毫没有觉察到我为他设了个圈套。我觉得自己不能对他玩如此卑鄙的花招，这就像用糖果欺骗一个小孩一样。你猜我后来是怎么处理的？我对他说：‘哦，也许你还是别上去了的好。妈妈今晚不太舒服。如果她睡着了，我不愿把她吵醒。晚安！’我仰起脸让他吻了吻，然后把他推出了门。这就是结局。”

“你感到遗憾吗？”我问。

“既不高兴，也不遗憾。我只是身不由己罢了。我那样做，并非出自我的意愿，而是有一种力量左右了我，驱使着我行事。”她莞尔一笑，“也许你会称之为良心发现吧。”

“我想你可以这样说。”

“那么，我的良心就只好自食其果了。我相信，它以后会倍加小心的。”

我们的谈话实际上就这样结束了。能敞开心扉跟人交谈，这对伊莎贝尔多少是一种安慰。而我帮不上忙，只能听她讲讲而已。我觉得自己有愧于她的信任，想找几句话安慰安慰她。

“要知道，一旦坠入爱河，”我说道，“你会觉得不可自拔，陷入深深的苦恼之中，好像永无摆脱之日。可是，看看大海，你就会心有所悟的。”

“此话怎讲？”她笑着问。

“哦，爱情就像一个很差劲的水手，一旦航行，它便痛苦不堪。可是，如果你抵达大西洋彼岸，跟拉里隔海相望，你会意外地发现启航前那种无法忍受的痛苦突然变得微不足道了。”

“这是你的经验之谈吗？”

“这是一个历尽沧桑的人的经验之谈。一旦情场失意，陷入痛苦之中时，我就立刻乘船远航。”

雨仍在淅淅沥沥下个不停。我们觉得就是不去参观汉普顿宫的那些皇家宫殿，甚至不去看伊丽莎白女王的寝室，伊莎贝尔照样能够活下去，于是我们乘车返回了伦敦城。这以后，我又见过伊莎贝尔两三次面，但都有他人在场。等到在伦敦住了一段时间后，我便启程到蒂罗尔[50]去了。





第三章


一


这以后，有十年的时间我再也没有见过伊莎贝尔和拉里。艾略特我倒是经常见，而且由于某种原因（容我以后向诸位交代）见的次数更多了。从他的嘴里，时不时会听到一些伊莎贝尔的情况。可是关于拉里，他不能提供任何信息。

“根据我了解的情况，他仍住在巴黎，只是不太可能碰上他的面。我们的社交圈子是不一样的。”后边的一句说出来时，他的语气里透出一股自豪感，“他沉沦到今天这种样子，叫人不胜伤感。论出身，他是相当不错的。假如他听我的话，我敢说我可以让他有所作为的。不管怎么说，伊莎贝尔摆脱他，算是吉星高照了。”

我跟艾略特有所不同，并非只跟一定圈子里的人打交道。在巴黎，我有一些熟人，在艾略特看来登不了大雅之堂。我虽然时常经过巴黎，但是待的时间都不太长。我曾经问过一两位熟人是否见过拉里，有没有他的消息。有几个熟人跟拉里是认识的，但没有一个和他是深交，于是无人了解他的近况。我去他常吃晚饭的那家餐馆打听消息，却发现他已经好久不去了，餐馆里的人说他可能搬走了。在附近居民常去的蒙巴纳斯林荫道上的那些咖啡馆，我也没有发现他的踪迹。

在伊莎贝尔离开巴黎之后，他原打算去希腊，后来放弃了。当时的实际情况，他多年以后才亲口告诉了我。不过，为了把事情尽量按照时间顺序排列，读起来方便些，我还是在此处对诸位讲一讲吧。他整个夏天都住在巴黎，苦读不休，直至深秋。

“那时我觉得需要放下书本，休息休息。”他说道，“我每天看八至十个小时的书，已有两年的时间了。于是，我就去了一座煤矿找活干。”

“你去哪里啦？”我失声叫道。

他见我一脸的惊讶，不由哈哈笑了。

“我认为干几个月的体力活对我有好处。我有一种感觉，干体力活能叫我理清思绪，使心情恢复平静。”

我没有吱声。我真不清楚，这是他迈出这出乎人意料之外的一步的唯一原因，还是与伊莎贝尔拒绝嫁给他也有关系。实际上，我也不知道他爱伊莎贝尔究竟有多深。大多数人在恋爱的时候会想出各种理由说服自己，认为按自己的心愿做事是合情合理的。天下婚姻多悲剧，恐怕这就是症结了。这情况就像有些人将自己的事情交给一个骗子去做一样——他们明明知道此人是骗子，却跟他关系很好，于是就不愿意相信他行骗会对朋友下手；他们坚信，他虽然对别人居心叵测，对自己决不会如此。拉里不肯为了伊莎贝尔牺牲自己心仪的生活，其意志相当坚定，可是失掉伊莎贝尔却又给他带来了痛苦，想不到竟如此难以忍受。这可能就是我们通常所说的“鱼和熊掌不可兼得”。

“哦，你继续讲。”我说道。

“我把书和衣服放在两只箱子里，交给美国运通公司保管。然后把一套替换的衣服和一些内衣打了个包，就动身了。我的希腊语教师有个妹妹嫁给了兰斯附近一座煤矿的经理，便写了一封信介绍我去见他。你知道兰斯吧？”

“不知道。”

“在法国北部，离比利时边界不远。我下榻于车站旅馆，在兰斯只待了一个晚上，次日就乘坐当地的火车去了煤矿。你去过矿区吗？”

“在英国去过。”

反正都差不多吧。那儿有煤矿，有经理的房子，还有两层高的矿工小屋，一排一排的，千篇一律，完全是一种模样，单调得让你的心直朝下沉。教堂是新建的，样子很难看。另外，街上还有几家酒吧间。我到达矿区时，天气阴冷，空中飘着毛毛细雨。我找到经理的办公室，把信交给了他。经理是个矮胖子，两颊红红的，看上去像是个贪嘴的人。矿上正缺工人，因为许多矿工都死在了战场上。有不少波兰人在此处打工，大概有两三百人吧。经理问了我一两个问题。他一听我是个美国人，好像觉得来头有些蹊跷。不过，他的小舅子把我夸成了一朵花，他也就乐于雇用我了。他要给我一个地面上的工作，可我说自己想下井。他说如果不习惯，在井下会吃不消的。我说自己已有心理准备。末了，他叫我给一个矿工当帮手。其实，那是童工干的活，只是眼下童工太少，不够用罢了。这位经理是个挺不错的人。他问我找到住处了没有，我说还没有找到。他便拿过一张纸写了个地址，说按这个地址找去，会有一位家庭主妇给我安排睡觉的地方的。那是个寡妇，丈夫是矿工，死于战火之中，她有两个儿子在矿上工作。

我拿起包袱，就告辞了。找到那户人家后，开门的是一个瘦高个女人，头发花白，有一双乌黑的大眼睛。她五官端正，年轻时一定颇有姿色。如果不是因为少了两颗门牙，就是现在也不一定会难看，会如此憔悴。她告诉我，说没有空房间了，但一个波兰人租下的房间里有两张床，我可以睡那张空床。楼上有两个房间，她的两个儿子住一间，她住另一间。她领我看的那个房间在楼下，可能以前是做客厅用的。我倒是想单独住一个房间，但又觉得还是别多事得好。外边毛毛细雨下个不停，雨势有所加大，而我已全身湿透。我不愿再到别处找房子，把自己浇成个落汤鸡。所以我说挺合适的，便住了下来。他们把厨房当作客厅使用，里边放着两把摇摇晃晃的扶手椅。院子里有个贮煤室，也兼作浴室用。她的两个儿子和那个波兰人把午饭带到上班的地方吃，她要我中午跟她一道吃饭。吃过饭，我坐在厨房里抽烟，她则忙家务，一边给我讲述她以及她家的情况。到了下班时间，那几个上班族便回来了。波兰人先回，那两个小伙子接踵而至。波兰人穿过厨房时，房东太太告诉他，说我要和他睡一个房间，而他仅仅冲我点了点头，什么话也没说。随后，他从炉子的铁架上拎起一只大水壶，到浴室里洗脸去了。两个小伙子都身材高挑，尽管脸上有煤污，看上去仍一表人才。他们似乎对我很友好。当得知我是个美国人时，便把我视为怪物。他们俩一个十九岁，退伍还乡才几个月，另一个十八岁。

波兰人洗完回来，两个小伙子就去浴室了。波兰人的名字属于很难叫出口的那一类，大伙儿都简单地叫他考斯迪。他是个大块头，比我要高出两三英寸，虎背熊腰，脸上苍白、多肉，鼻子短而宽，大嘴巴。他的眼睛是蓝颜色的，由于没有能把眉毛和睫毛上面的煤灰洗掉，看上去就像描了眉一样。由于睫毛特别黑，就把他的眼睛衬托得蓝得惊人。这家伙长相丑陋，为人有点粗野。那两个小伙子洗完，换了身衣服就出去了。波兰人坐在厨房里一边抽烟斗一边看报。我口袋里有本书，于是拿出来，也开始看起来。我留意到，他瞥过我一两眼。过了没多久，他放下了手中的报纸。

‘你在看什么书？’他问。

我把书递给他，让他自己看。那是一本《克里夫斯公主》，我在巴黎火车站买的，小版本的，可以放在口袋里。他看看书，又看看我，一副诧异的样子，随后把书还给了我。我注意到他的嘴角浮现出一丝嘲讽的微笑。

‘有意思吗？’

‘我觉得非常有意思，甚至可以说是引人入胜。’

‘我在华沙上中学时读过此书。我觉得味如嚼蜡。’他的法语讲得很好，一点波兰口音也没有，‘现在我除了报纸和侦探小说外，什么都不看。’

勒克莱尔太太（这是我们房东太太的名字）一边留意着炉子上为晚饭煮的汤，一边坐在桌旁补袜子。她告诉考斯迪，说我是煤矿经理介绍来的，把我对她讲过的一席话重复了一遍。波兰人听着，抽着烟斗，用湛蓝湛蓝的眼睛打量着我。那双眼严苛、精明。他问了我几个问题。当我告诉他，说我从来没有在煤矿上干过时，他的嘴角又浮现出了嘲讽的微笑。

‘你都不知道自己在做什么。只要有别的路可走，谁都不愿当矿工的。不过，这是你的事情，你肯定有自己的原因。你在巴黎住在哪里？’

我如实做了回答。

‘有一个时期，我每年都要去巴黎走一走，不过，都是在大街上逛悠。你去拉鲁埃餐馆吃过饭吗？那是我最喜欢去的馆子。’

“我听了觉得有点奇怪，因为那家餐馆的饭菜并不便宜。”

“一点都不便宜。”

他可能看明白了我的心思，因为他的嘴角又浮现出了那种嘲讽的微笑。不过，他显然觉得没必要做进一步的解释。我们东一搭西一搭地扯些咸淡话，直至两个小伙子回来。随后，大家在一起吃晚饭。饭毕，考斯迪问我愿不愿到小酒馆[51]喝一杯。小酒馆设在一个非常大的房间里，有个吧台在房间的一端，屋里摆着几张大理石面桌子，每张桌子旁放几把木椅。酒馆里配有一架自动钢琴，有人往投币孔里塞了一枚硬币，此时钢琴正在弹奏一首舞曲。除掉我们坐的那张桌子外，只有三张桌子旁坐有人。考斯迪问我会不会玩勃洛特牌戏[52]。我曾经跟我的同学学过这种游戏，于是便说自己会玩。他建议我们赌一把，以啤酒为赌注。我同意后，他叫人把纸牌拿了来。我连着输了两局。这时，他提议我们赌钱。他拿的牌好，而我的运气很糟。我们赌的是小钱，但最终我还是输掉了好几法郎。赢了钱，再加上啤酒助兴，他心情很好，打开了话匣子。不一会儿工夫，我就从他的谈吐和行为方式看出他是个受过教育的人。当他重又谈到巴黎时，他就问我认不认识某某人和某某人。他说的是几个美国女人，路易莎伯母和伊莎贝尔住在艾略特家里时，我曾在那儿碰见过。他好像比我跟那些人熟悉得多。我不明白他为什么落到了今天这个地步。此时天色并不算晚，但我们次日天一破晓就得起床呢。

‘走之前，咱们再喝一杯吧。’考斯迪说。

他一面呷着啤酒，一面用他那精明的小眼睛瞅着我。他那样子使我联想到了肥猪，一头脾气暴躁的肥猪。

‘你为什么跑到这个烂煤矿受苦？’他问我。

‘为了体验生活。’

‘你是昏了头了，小伙子。’[53]他说。

‘那你为什么来呢？’

他耸了耸他那厚实、笨拙的肩膀。

‘我小的时候便进了少年军事学校。我父亲是沙皇麾下的一个将军。在上次大战中，我是一名骑兵军官。我无法忍受皮尔苏茨基[54]，我们策划杀死他，却被人出卖了。凡是被捕的，都叫他枪决了。我侥幸逃过了边境。当时摆在我面前的只有两条路：加入法国的外籍军团或者下井挖煤。我选择了后一种罪恶感比较轻的出路。’

之前，我已经告诉过考斯迪我预备在煤矿上做什么工作，他当时没有说什么，这时却见他将胳膊肘在大理石桌面上一架，说道：‘来，试试把我的手掰下去。’

我懂得这是一种老式的角力，于是摊开手，跟他的手握在了一起。他哈哈一笑说：‘用不了几个星期，你的手就不会这么柔软了。’我使出吃奶的气力把他的手朝下扳，可抵不住他的神力。渐渐地，他将我的手朝下压，最终压到了桌面上。

‘你真有劲。’承蒙他这么夸奖我，‘能坚持这么长时间的人是不多的。你听我说，我的助手屁用都不顶，是个三寸丁的法国人，手无缚鸡之力。不如你明天跟我走，我跟工头说叫你做我的助手。’

‘我愿意跟你去。’我说，‘你看工头会同意吗？’

‘这得有见面礼。你拿得出五十个法郎吗？’

“他说完把手伸出来，我从钱包里掏出一张五十法郎的钞票递给他。之后我们便回去睡觉。那一天真够累的，我一躺下便睡得像死猪。”

“你是不是发现挖煤的活十分艰辛？”我问拉里。

“起初，累得人腰酸背痛。”他咧开嘴笑了笑说，“考斯迪打通了工头的关系，让我当上了他的助手。那时，他在一块旅馆浴室那么大的空间里干活，进去时得手脚并用爬过一条非常低的隧道。里面热得像火炉，干活时浑身脱得精光，只穿一条裤子。考斯迪的身子又白又胖，活像一条巨无霸鼻涕虫，看了叫人心生厌恶。在那巴掌大的地方，气动挖煤机发出的声音震耳欲聋。我的任务是把他切下来的煤块装进一个筐子，再拖着筐子爬过隧道，将其拖到隧道口。隔一段时间就有一辆运煤车开过来，煤块便被装进车斗，然后运往电梯那儿。这是我平生第一次下井，不知道这流程是否规范，只觉得不太专业化，简直是牛马干的活。中途，我们停下手休息——吃午饭和抽烟。一天干下来，我的感觉并不糟糕，再洗个澡，舒服极了。我当时觉得自己的脚恐怕永远也别想洗干净了——那双脚黑得像煤炭。我的手磨出了水泡，疼得像刀割，但后来都长好了。渐渐地，挖煤的活我就干惯了。”

“你坚持了多长时间？”

当助手的活我只干了几个星期。话说那些往电梯口运煤的车，它们是靠一辆拖拉机拖拽的。拖拉机驾驶员只会开，不懂机械，而拖拉机的引擎经常出毛病。有一次出毛病，他修理不好，一时不知所措。我可是个呱呱叫的机修工，帮他瞧了瞧，没过半个小时便排除了故障。工头将此事告诉了经理，经理把我找了去，问我懂不懂汽车。结果呢，他给了我一份机修工的工作。当然，那工作单调乏味，可我干起来得心应手。由于汽车一有故障就被排除，他们对我很是满意。

我离开了考斯迪，这叫他窝了一肚子的火。我们俩配合默契，已彼此适应。成天跟他一起干活，晚饭后一起下酒馆，睡觉时分享一个房间，我把他已摸得透透的。他是个古怪的人，叫你一见就会留下印象。他不跟波兰人来往，波兰人去的咖啡馆我们就不去。他总忘记不了自己是贵族，而且当过骑兵军官，所以，他把那些波兰人都看得粪土不如。那些波兰人当然气得不得了，可又奈何不了他——他壮得像头牛，打起架来，不管用不用刀子，五六个人近不了他的身。尽管如此，我还是结识了几个波兰人。他们告诉我，说他在一个很棒的骑兵分队里当过军官是真的，但至于说他是出于政治原因被迫离开了波兰，那是一派胡言——他是被华沙军官俱乐部开除了，并解除了他的军职，理由是他打牌时抽老千，叫人抓了个正着。他们警告我不要跟他打牌，说他老躲着他们是因为他们知道他的底细，不愿跟他在一起待。

我和他打牌老输，但每次输得不多，只不过区区几个法郎，而且他总是争着付酒钱，所以实际上也就算不了什么。我以为自己仅仅是手气不好罢了，或者说自己的牌技不如他。可是，了解了内幕后，我就擦亮眼睛注意观察，百分之百地肯定他在抽老千。可是，即便要了我的命，我也看不出他是怎么捣的鬼。啊，他可真是聪明到家了。我明明知道他不可能老拿到最好的牌，却苦于抓不着把柄。我像猞猁一样紧盯着他不放，而他似狐狸一般狡猾。他可能发现我在提防着他了。一天晚上，我们玩了一会儿牌之后，他看着我，脸上浮现出那种无情、嘲讽的微笑（他只会这种笑法），款款说道：‘想不想让我给你变几个戏法看？’

他把纸牌拿过去，让我说一张牌，然后洗了牌，叫我随便取一张。我取出一张看了看，发现正是我方才说的那张。他又变了两个戏法，然后问我会不会玩扑克游戏，我说会玩。于是他就给我发了几张牌。我看了看，发现手里拿的是四张A和一张老K。

‘愿意不愿意给你手里的牌下一笔大赌注？’

‘我愿意把所有的钱都押上。’我回答说。

‘那你就傻了。’他说完把手里的牌摊在了桌子上——原来是一把同花顺。这叫我一头雾水。他见我一脸的诧异，不由哈哈大笑起来，说道：‘假如我不是个规矩人，我会叫你把身上的衣服都输掉的。’

‘现在你把我赢得也够惨的了。’我笑着说。

‘一点小钱，连去拉鲁埃餐馆打打牙祭都不够。’

我们每晚仍继续打牌，而且兴致很高。我得出的结论是，他抽老千与其说是为了赢钱，还不如说是为了寻乐子。他对自己能够愚弄我而感到一种异样的满足。也许最叫他感到高兴的是：我明明知道他在捣鬼，却弄不清他是怎么捣的。

不过，这只是他的一个方面，而使我最感兴趣的却是他的另一方面。我简直无法把这两方面调和起来。虽则他自夸除掉报纸和侦探小说以外，什么都不看，但其实他是个有学问的人。他很健谈，语言犀利、刻薄，夹枪带棒的，然而却让听者兴奋不已。他是个虔诚的天主教徒，床头挂一个十字架，每逢星期天就去做弥撒。星期六的晚上则以酒为伴。我们去的那个酒馆[55]一到星期六便顾客盈门，屋里空气混浊，烟雾缭绕。客人中有携家人而至的沉默寡言的中年矿工，有结伙而来的喧闹不已的年轻人；一些酒客围在桌旁玩勃洛特牌戏[56]，脸上淌着汗，嘴里大声吆喝着，他们的贤内助则坐在他们身后观战。人群和喧闹声对考斯迪会产生奇特的影响，使他变得深沉。这时的他会谈一些你想不到的话题，会谈神秘主义。至于神秘主义，我在巴黎时仅仅读过梅特林克[57]写的一篇关于鲁斯布鲁克的文章，其他便一无所知了。而考斯迪却大谈普罗提诺[58]、古希腊雅典最高法院的法官丹尼斯、鞋匠雅各布·贝姆[59]以及迈斯特·埃克纳特[60]。听这样一个被自己的社会圈子驱逐出来的大块头游民，一个愤世嫉俗、牢骚满腹、穷困潦倒的人，大谈什么万物的本质以及和上帝合为一体的极乐境界，简直是匪夷所思。这些情况我闻所未闻，让我感到迷茫，也感到激动。我就像一个躺在黑屋子里的人，窗帘的缝隙透进一线光亮，心里知道只要拉开窗帘，眼前就会出现一片沐浴在灿烂曙光里的原野。不过，在没有喝醉酒的情况下，你再跟他扯这个话题，他会生气的，眼睛露出恶狠狠的光。

‘我都不知道自己说了些啥，怎么能给你讲呢？’他会板着脸说。

“可我知道他在睁着眼说瞎话。他完全清楚自己说的是什么。他的知识非常渊博。他当时喝醉了酒固然不错，但他的眼神以及那张丑脸上激昂的表情，就不能仅仅用一句喝醉了的话搪塞过去的。情况并非如此简单。他第一次跟我那般说话，其话语我一直都没有忘掉，因为我当时都惊呆了。他竟然说这个世界并非上帝所创造，说无中不能生有，而是一种永恒的存在。这还罢了，他竟然又说恶和善一样，都直接反映着上天的意志。酒馆里肮脏不堪、人声喧哗，再加上那架自动钢琴弹奏着舞曲，他的话在这种环境中听上去怪兮兮的。”





二


此处我另起一节，好让读者有片刻喘气的机会。这样做，完全是为了读者考虑。拉里的叙述并没有因此而中止。趁此机会，我想说，他叙述时不慌不忙，斟词酌句的。虽然不敢说我能把他的话原封不动再现给诸位，但我做出了努力，不仅努力复述出事情的经过，还努力再现他说话的方式。他的声音圆润，犹如天籁之音，十分悦耳。他说着，一口一口抽着烟斗，时不时会停下来把熄灭了的烟斗再点着，只是说，不加任何手势。他直直望着我，乌黑的眼睛里有一种令人愉快的，并且让人捉摸不透的表情。

后来，春天姗姗而至。在那片平坦而荒凉的乡间，春天来得晚，天气依然寒冷，细雨绵绵。不过，有时会出现一个晴暖天，惹得矿工们都不愿离开地面，坐着摇摇晃晃的电梯（电梯里会挤满身穿肮脏工作服的矿工），钻到数百英尺以下的地球深处去了。春天已经露面，但羞羞答答不敢跨入这片阴冷、肮脏的矿区，好像害怕不受欢迎似的。它宛若一朵鲜花（水仙或百合），开在贫民区住房窗台上的一个花盆里，叫你弄不懂它在那儿干什么。星期天的早晨，我们总是赖在床上不起来。在这样的一个早晨，我正躺在床上看书，考斯迪望着外面的蓝天，对我说道：‘我要离开这儿了。你愿意跟我一起走吗？’

我知道有许多波兰人一到夏天就回他们国家割麦子，而现在还不到收割的季节。再说，考斯迪现在是有国不能回。

‘你要到哪儿去？’我问道。

‘浪迹天涯——穿过比利时到德国，再沿莱茵河朝前走。夏天，就到农场去打打零工。’

我听后，当下便做出了决定，于是说道：‘这主意挺不错的。’

次日，我们告诉工头，说我们不干了。我找到一个人愿意拿旅行背包换我的提包。我把不想要的，或者说不便路上带的衣服，全都给了勒克莱尔太太的小儿子——他跟我的身材差不多。到了第二天，老太婆供我们喝了咖啡，我们就出发了。

一路上我们不慌不忙，因为我们知道起码得等到麦收季节才能在农场找到活干。我们就这样慢慢悠悠从那慕尔和列日穿过法国及比利时，再经由亚琛进入德国境内。我们每天顶多走十英里或十二英里路，遇见中意的村子便歇脚。车到山前必有路——总能找到住宿的客栈和吃肉喝酒的酒馆。总体而言，天气还是不错的。在矿上熬煎了那么多的日月，现在来到开阔的野外，感觉真好。以前真是没有想到绿茵地竟是那么美不胜收；树木尚未长出树叶，而树枝上蒙了一层薄雾般的新绿，竟会那么赏心悦目。后来，考斯迪开始教我学习德语——他的德语和法语讲得一样棒。走在路上，遇见形形色色的景物（或牛或马，或人及其他），他都会把相应的德语告诉我，还会叫我重复简单的德语句子。时间就这样悄然逝去。进入德国境内时，我至少可以用德语问路了。

科隆稍微偏离了一点我们的路线，可是考斯迪硬要到那儿去一趟，说是为了那一万一千名殉道修女[61]。等我们到了科隆时，他便恣意酗酒，一连三天不见人影。我们下榻的地方有点像工人宿舍。待他回到住处，一脸的愠色。原来，他跟人打了一架，眼睛都被打青了，嘴唇有一道血口子，可以说样子很惨。他倒头睡了两天两夜。然后，我们沿着莱茵河的河谷向达姆施塔特进发。他说那儿风光旖旎，而且我们极有可能找到工作。

我从来都没有如此开心过。天气持续晴好。我们走过一个个小镇、一座座村庄。遇见美丽的景色，我们就驻足欣赏。找见住宿的地方，我们便停下来过夜，有一两次睡在稻草堆上。路边有客栈，我们就进去饱餐一顿。进入盛产葡萄酒的地区时，我们就不喝啤酒，以葡萄酒取而代之了。在酒馆里，我们结交了一些朋友。考斯迪粗犷而快活，赢得了酒友们的信任，于是大家一起打司卡特（一种德国的牌戏）。他谈笑风生，一团和气，暗中却抽老千。他满嘴粗俗的玩笑，很得酒友们的喜欢，所以也就不太在意输钱给他了。我则借机练习说德语。在科隆的时候，我买了一本袖珍英德会话手册，学习德语取得了很大的进步。一到晚上，两大盅白葡萄酒落肚，考斯迪便以一种病态的口吻大谈什么从孤独逃离，最后还是孤独，谈灵魂的暗夜，谈生灵与造物主合为一体的极乐境界。可是次日清早，走在明媚的乡野间，青草上露水滴滴，我想让他继续讲下去的时候，他却勃然大怒，差点没动手打我。

‘住口，笨蛋！’他说道，‘乱七八糟的东西，讲那些有什么意思！好啦，还是学德语顶用。’

你是不能跟他犟嘴的——他那汽锤一般的拳头可不是吃素的，说打你就会打你。他发火的样子我可是领教过。他可以一拳把我打昏，将我丢在臭水沟里。趁着我昏迷不醒，他会掏光我的口袋。他这个人真是叫人捉摸不透。当葡萄酒打开他的话匣子，他谈到至高无上的主宰时，他会避开平时讲的那些粗野下流话，就像脱掉下井穿的肮脏的工作服一样，换上一种很文雅的语言，滔滔不绝，口若悬河。要说他缺乏虔诚之意，我是不相信的。可不知怎么我突发奇想，认为他下井干那种艰辛、非人的活儿，只是想折磨自己的肉体。他仿佛憎恨自己那个丑陋、庞大的身躯，渴望叫它受点罪。他抽老千也罢，发脾气也罢，抑或行为残暴，都是他的意志（噢，不知怎么命名这种概念才好）对根深蒂固的神之本性的反抗，是对自己内心欲望的反抗——他渴望见到既让自己害怕又让自己迷茫的上帝。

我们徐徐而行。已到了春末，树上长满了绿叶。葡萄园里的果实越来越丰满。我们一直走的都是土路，路上尘土飞扬。进入达姆施塔特一带时，考斯迪建议找个活儿干，因为身上带的钱都快花光了。我口袋里倒还有六七张旅行支票，但我拿定主意不到万不得已时不取出来使用。后来，我们看见一所农舍样子挺气派，便停下来问他们要不要帮手。当时，敢说我们看上去不太讨人喜欢——风尘仆仆，汗和尘土把我们都弄成了大花脸。考斯迪样子像个土匪，我的样子恐怕也强不到哪儿去。于是，我们屡屡吃闭门羹。有一户农家愿意雇用考斯迪，却不愿用我。考斯迪说我们是好朋友，是不能分开的。我叫他留下干，可他硬是不肯。这叫我感到有点意外。他喜欢我，我是清楚的，其中的原因我想象不来，因为我并不是对他有用处的那种人。可是，至于说因为喜欢我，为了我而放弃一个工作，就是我始料未及的了。离开那户农家后，我感到良心大受谴责，因为实际上我并不喜欢他，甚至很讨厌他。但是，当我想要说几句话，表示我对他这样做感到高兴时，他把我臭骂了一顿。

最后，我们终于时来运转了。话说我们刚刚走出一个山谷里的村庄，便瞧见了一所独门独户的农舍，外表看上去还不错。敲了敲门，开门的是个女人。我们照例介绍了来意，声称不要工钱，只管吃住就行了。想不到的是，她没有当着我们的面砰的一声把门关上，而是叫我们稍候。她冲屋里叫人，很快有一个男子走了出来。此人把我们细细打量一番，问我们从何处来，叫我们出示证件。他发现我是个美国人，便把我多看了一眼，似乎不太乐意用我。不过，他还是请我们进屋先喝杯酒再说。他领我们进了厨房，大家一起坐下。那女人端来一壶酒和几个杯子。男子告诉我们，说他家的雇工被公牛抵伤了，现在医院里，要等到庄稼收割之后才能康复。当地人有许多都战死于疆场，活着的却进了那些在莱茵河畔拔地而起的工厂里做工，于是便使得找个雇工十分艰难。这种情况我们是知道的，并且对此加以利用。长话短说，他最终决定雇用我们。他家的房间倒是不少，但他可能不愿让我们住在他家，于是告诉我们说干草棚里有两张床，我们可以宿在那里。

农场上的活不重，无非就是放牛牧猪什么的。机械坏了，就帮着修修。空闲时间还是有的。我喜欢那些芳香的草地，傍晚时分经常四处游荡，做一做空梦。那是一种十分惬意的生活。

这户人家的家庭成员有贝克尔老夫妇，以及他们那带着几个孩子守寡的儿媳。贝克尔年近五旬，五大三粗，头发花白。他打过仗，腿上负过伤，至今走路仍一瘸一拐的。腿伤叫他疼痛难忍，只好以酒消痛，常在睡觉前喝得酩酊大醉。考斯迪和他相处得很好，晚饭后时常一起去酒馆，打打司卡特牌戏[62]，灌灌黄汤。贝克尔太太原来是家里的女佣，是他们从孤儿院里领来的，贝克尔在妻子死后不久便续娶了她。她比贝克尔小好多岁，也还有点姿色，丰胸肥臀，红红的脸蛋，一头金发，妖妖娆娆的。考斯迪不久便断言那女人是有些风情的。我警告他不要做傻事，说我们有份好工作，不能因此而丢掉。他仅仅只是嘲笑了我几句，说贝克尔满足不了她，是她自己想来一手的。我情知劝他守规矩也是白费口舌，但我还是告诫他三思而后行。贝克尔也许看不出他心怀鬼胎，可是他的儿媳却是个明眼人，任什么都逃不过她的眼睛。

他的儿媳名叫埃莉，是个又高又壮的少妇，年龄不足三十岁，黑眼睛，黑头发，一张蜡黄的方脸老是郁郁不乐的。丈夫阵亡于凡尔登战役，她仍在服丧期。她是个虔诚的教徒，每逢星期天早晨，都要到村子里去做早弥撒，下午又会跑去做晚祷。她有三个孩子，其中一个是遗腹子，是丈夫死后出生的。一家人吃饭时，她除了骂孩子，否则从不开口说话。她很少下地干农活，大部分时间都用来看孩子。一到晚上，她就独自一人坐在客厅里看小说，让客厅的门敞开着，便于听到孩子的哭声。两个女人势同水火。埃莉瞧不起贝克尔太太，嫌她是个弃儿，做过用人。而今，贝克尔太太是一家之主妇，有权发号施令，这叫她气不打一处来。

埃莉是一户富裕农家的千金，嫁过来时带了一笔不菲的嫁妆。她没有在村里上学，而是去邻近的茨温根贝格城，上的是女子高级学校[63]，受过良好的教育。可怜的贝克尔太太十四岁就来到了农场当用人，能够看得懂书、写得了字，对她而言就很不错了。两个女人之间有裂痕，这也是其中的一个原因。埃莉一有机会就卖弄她的学问，会把贝克尔太太气得满脸通红，就问要学问对于一个农夫的妻子有什么用。这时，埃莉会看看自己用钢链套在手腕上的亡夫的身份牌，阴沉的脸上浮现出凶狠的表情，说道：‘不是农夫的妻子，而是农夫的寡妇——只不过，这个农夫是个为国捐躯的英雄。’

“可怜的贝克尔老头放着农活干不成，在她们之间当起了和事佬。”

“插一句，他们是怎么看你的呢？”我打断拉里的话问道。

哦，他们把我当成了美军的逃兵，不敢回到美国去，一回去就要被关进大牢。我不愿意跟贝克尔和考斯迪去酒馆喝酒，他们认为就是因为这个缘故。他们觉得我是不想引起人们注意，不想招来村警盘问我。当埃莉得知我在学德语，便把她用过的旧课本拿了来，说要教我。于是，吃过晚饭后我们俩就会到客厅里去学习，把贝克尔太太一个人丢在厨房里。我大声朗读，埃莉为我纠音。遇到不懂的词，她就给我解释。我猜想她这样做与其说是帮助我，还不如说是在向贝克尔太太传达某种隐晦的意思。

“考斯迪一直都在挖空心思勾引贝克尔太太，但是没有进展。贝克尔太太高高兴兴、乐乐呵呵，跟他插科打诨、谈笑风生，而他是个风月老手，自有一套手段。我猜她知道考斯迪的用心，敢说她为此而感到得意。可是，当考斯迪对她动手动脚时，她呵斥他放规矩些，还扇了他一记耳光。我敢说，那一耳光打得可真是不轻。”

说到这里，拉里犹豫了一下，难为情地笑了笑。

我从来不觉得自己是个有女人缘的人。可是我依稀感到……感到贝克尔太太看上了我。这叫我很不舒服。一是因为她比我大得多，二是由于贝克尔老先生对我们一直都很不错。吃饭时，贝克尔太太管分菜，我暗中注意到她给我的菜总会比别人的多。她好像在找机会同我单独在一起。她冲着我微笑——那种笑容可以说是具有挑逗性的。她问我有没有女朋友，说我这样的小伙子到这种地方来，身边没个女人一定会很痛苦的。她话里边的含意你应该是清楚的。我只带了三件衬衫，而且都穿得很破了。有一次，她说我破衣烂衫的怪丢人，叫我把衬衫交给她补一补。这话让埃莉听去了。一次，她趁旁边没人的时候说，如果我有缝缝补补的活儿，可以交给她做。我胡乱支吾了几句。可是，一两天后，我发觉自己袜子上的洞全补好了，衬衫也打了补丁，放回到了干草棚里的长凳上（我们的物件都摆放在这条凳子上）。这是她们俩哪一个的善举，我不得而知。当然喽，我并没有将贝克尔太太当回事。她心眼好，可我觉得她的情感仅是母性的一种表现。可是有一天考斯迪对我说：

‘告诉你吧，她想要的不是我，而是你。我算是没有戏了。’

‘别胡扯！’我正色道，‘她年龄大得都可以当我的妈妈。’

‘这有什么关系？你只管追她就是了，老弟，我不会碍你事的。她也许不那么年轻了，但身体还是挺有女人味的。’

‘天呀，请你别说了。’

“为什么要优柔寡断呢？但愿不是为了我。我可是个达观者，懂得”天涯何处无芳草的道理。我不怪她，因为你年轻么。我年轻时也风光过。应该趁年轻及时行乐。[64]

“考斯迪那样捕风捉影，样子那般深信不疑，叫我心中有点不悦。出现这种情况，我真不知该怎么对付才好。此时，我想起了一些以前没有重视过的现象，想起了以前从未往心上放的埃莉的一些言语。我大有恍然大悟之感，坚信埃莉是知情的。贝克尔太太和我单独在厨房里时，她会突然闯进来。我觉得她好像在监视我们，这叫我很不高兴。她可能是想捉奸哩。我知道她恨贝克尔太太，有点机会就恨不得生出些事端来。当然，若说捉奸，那是不可能的。可是，这个女人可不是个善茬，谁知道会编出什么谎话来灌进贝克尔老先生的耳朵里呢。我没有脱身良策，只好装痴装傻，假装不知道她们在演什么戏。在这个农场，我日子过得开心，也喜欢这儿的农活，绝不愿意在收麦之前就离开。”

听着听着，我不禁哑然失笑。可以想象得来拉里当时的模样——身穿缀着补丁的衬衣、短裤，脸和脖子被莱茵河的太阳晒得发紫，身体敏捷、苗条，黑黑的眼深嵌在眼窝里。我坚信，这种模样一定会让贝克尔太太这样丰胸肥乳的金发主妇欲火中烧。

“后来怎么样呢？”我问道。

夏日的时光在流淌。我们像牛马般干着活，收割完小麦，将麦秆堆成干草垛。后来樱桃熟了。我和考斯迪就爬上梯子摘樱桃，由两个女人把摘下来的樱桃装进大箩筐，再由贝克尔老先生送到茨温根贝格城里去卖掉。再接下来就是收割黑麦了。这期间，我们始终没忘了放牛牧猪。我们天不亮就起来干活，天黑时才收工。我心想贝克尔太太可能觉得我是个不开窍的榆木疙瘩，不再理会我了。在尽量不得罪她的情况下，我跟她保持着一定的距离。一到晚上，我便困得不行，看不了几眼德文书了，吃完晚饭就回到我们住的干草棚里，倒头便睡。贝克尔和考斯迪晚上一般都要去村里泡酒馆。等到考斯迪从酒馆回来，我早已进入了梦乡。干草棚里很热，我睡觉时脱得精光。

一天夜里，我被弄醒了。开头，我搞不清是怎么回事。就在我半睡半醒之际，只感到一只热乎乎的手捂住了我的嘴，这才发觉有人和我睡在一起。我将捂在我嘴上的那只手推开，接着就有一张嘴贴在了我的嘴上，两条胳膊把我搂紧。我感觉到那是贝克尔太太——她那丰满的胸脯紧紧偎在我身上。

‘别出声！[65]别出声！’她低声说。

“她身体紧紧抵住我，用滚烫、丰满的嘴唇吻我，两只手抚摸我的全身，两条大腿夹在我的大腿中间。”

拉里停了下来。我哧哧笑了几声。

“你是怎么反应的呢？”

他冲我难为情地一笑，甚至脸都有点红了。

“我有什么办法呢？旁边的床上睡着考斯迪，他沉重的呼吸声清晰可闻。约瑟夫[66]的故事我一直都觉得有点可笑。我只有二十三岁呀。反正我觉得不便闹起来将她赶下床。我不愿意刺伤她的感情，于是就依顺了她。”

“完事后，她溜下床，蹑手蹑脚走掉了。可以说，我轻轻舒了口气。要知道，我都快吓死啦。‘老天呀，真是险啊！’我对自己说。我想着贝克尔很可能吃得大醉回来，昏昏沉沉睡着了。可是，两口子睡一张床，他一觉醒来不见了妻子，那该如何是好？另外，还有埃莉。她老说自己睡觉睡不踏实。万一她醒着，听见贝克尔太太下楼走出屋子，那该怎么办呢？就在这时，我突然想起了一个细节——贝克尔太太和我睡在一起时，我觉得有个金属片抵在了我身上。你也知道，在干那种事的时候，这种细节是注意不到的。我也一直没有细想过那究竟是何物。突然，我若有所悟。当时我坐在床沿上，正愁肠百结，担心此事会产生严重后果呢，一个念头闪过我的脑际，惊得我跳了起来。那个金属片其实是埃莉丈夫的身份牌，她历来都是套在手腕上的。原来，和我同眠共枕的不是贝克尔太太，而是埃莉！”

我听了笑得肚子疼，想停也停不下来。

“你可能觉得好笑，”拉里说，“而我并不觉得。”

“你现在回想一下当时的情景，你不觉得其中有几分幽默吗？”

拉里嘴边勉强地露出了一丝微笑。

“也许吧。不过，当时的处境很是尴尬。真不知事情会怎么收场呢。我不喜欢埃莉，觉得她是个非常讨人嫌的女人。”

“问题在于，你怎么会认错人呢？”

当时屋子里黑得伸手不见五指。她除了叫我不要作声外，一句话也没说。她们两个身材都高大、壮实。我认为只是贝克尔太太看上了我，怎么也想不到埃莉也对我起了念头。她一贯心里只有亡夫的呀。我点起一根烟，边抽烟边权衡自己的处境，越想越觉得不妙。三十六计，走为上计！

“平时我老怪考斯迪睡觉太死，叫都叫不醒。下井的那段时间，我常常为了让他按时起床，上班不迟到，非得狠劲摇他不行。而此时他睡觉睡得死，我倒要感谢他了。点亮提灯，穿好衣服，我将自己的用品塞进背包里——东西不多，这一过程很快就完成了。然后，将背包背上肩，穿着袜子走过去，下了楼梯后才把鞋穿上，并吹熄了灯。夜晚漆黑一片，一点月光也没有。好在我认得路，上了大道后便向村子那个方向走去。我走得很快，想趁着人们还未起床赶紧穿过村子。此处距离茨温根贝格城只有十二英里的路程。抵达那儿时，街上刚开始有人走动。那段路程我终生难忘。路上，万籁俱寂，只能听得见脚下沙沙的脚步声，还能听见时不时传来农户人家的公鸡打鸣的声音。后来，天空半明半暗，出现了鱼肚白，再接下来就是曙光初露，太阳冉冉升起。只见百鸟啁啾，那绿油油的田野、草地和树林以及田间的小麦都沐浴在静谧的晨光里，像是披着金裹着银。到了茨温根贝格城里，我喝了杯咖啡，吃了块面包，然后去邮局给美国运通公司发电报，叫他们把我的衣服和书寄到波恩去。”

“为什么要到波恩去？”我打断他的话问。

“我们俩沿着莱茵河畔旅行时，曾在那儿歇过脚，我当时就喜欢上了那座城市。我喜欢看阳光照在千家万户的屋顶上以及河面上，喜欢那古老的窄街、别墅、花园和一排排的栗子树，喜欢高等学府那洛可可式建筑。我觉得那是个挺不错的地方，在那儿住上一段时间是很惬意的。不过，我认为到那儿去，最好先把自己收拾得像个样。我看上去像个流浪汉，到哪户人家找住处的时候，都可能得不到对方的信任。于是，我乘坐火车去了法兰克福，买了个皮包和几件衣服。在波恩，我断断续续住了有一年的光景。”

“你下井挖过煤，在农场干过农活，那样的人生经历你有收获吗？”

“有。”拉里点头笑着说。

不过，他没有说出究竟是什么样的收获。此时的我对他已非常了解，知道他愿意说，就一定会说的，如果不愿意说，那他会开个玩笑将话题引开，你再怎么问也是白搭。在此，我必须提醒读者，这一切都是在事情发生十年之后他才告诉我的。在这以前，也就是我和他重又碰面之前，我不知他身在何方，也不知他在干些什么，亦不知他是生是死。要不是跟艾略特有点交情，从他那儿了解到一些伊莎贝尔的情况，从而回忆起拉里，我肯定早已忘掉有这个人了。





三


跟拉里解除婚约后第二年的六月初，伊莎贝尔就嫁给了格雷·马图林。此时，巴黎的社交季节正在高潮，艾略特要参加许多场规模宏大的宴会，所以他一百个不愿意离开巴黎，但由于他的家族感情异常强烈，容不得他忽略掉在他看来是自己分内的职责。伊莎贝尔的兄长们远在天边，无法抛下那儿的工作回家参加婚礼，于是他只好踏上恼人的旅途，前往芝加哥为外甥女主婚了。他想起那些法国贵族都是穿着盛装上断头台的，所以特地上伦敦购置了一套新晨礼服、一件青灰色双排纽扣的大衣和一顶丝绸礼帽。一返回巴黎，他就把我请去看他试装。他选了一条浅灰色的领带，自认为适合于婚礼上佩戴，可是再用平时的那枚珍珠别针，便不伦不类了，这叫他很恼火。我建议他改用他那枚镶着翡翠和钻石的别针。

“如果我只是个宾客嘛……这也就罢了，”他说，“而我担任主婚人的特殊责任，便感觉到珍珠有一种象征意义。”

他对这门亲事非常满意，认为从各方面看，双方都是门当户对的。一说起来，他便眉飞色舞，就像个孀居的公爵夫人在议论拉罗什富科家族的公子跟蒙特默伦西家族的千金结下的天设地造的良缘。为了明确表示自己满意的心情，他不惜重金买了一幅纳蒂埃为法兰西王室的一个公主画的精美的肖像，准备带去作为结婚礼物。

亨利·马图林好像给小两口在阿斯特街买了一幢房子，靠近布雷德利夫人住的地方，离他自己在湖滨道的那座富丽堂皇的府邸也不太远。说来也巧，购置这幢房子时，格雷戈里·布拉巴宗恰好在芝加哥，房子的内部装饰就交给了他，而我怀疑艾略特和布拉巴宗在这件事上是串通好了的。艾略特返回欧洲时，舍弃了巴黎的社交盛宴，直接取道前往伦敦，给格雷戈里·布拉巴宗带去一些室内装饰的照片作为样本。后者放手大干了一场。客厅的装饰完全是乔治二世时期的风格，显得金碧辉煌。至于书房——格雷将来的小天地，格雷戈里是靠慕尼黑的阿玛利堡宫里一间屋子给他的启发来进行装饰的，除了没有地方放书外，可以说无懈可击。格雷戈里为这对年轻的美国夫妇把寝室装饰得十分舒适（那张双人床不算在内），就是法王路易十五在这里幽会蓬帕杜夫人，也会觉得舒心安逸，而伊莎贝尔的浴室则会叫路易十五大开眼界——那儿完全是玻璃世界，有玻璃墙壁、玻璃天花板、玻璃浴缸；墙根的玻璃鱼缸里有银色的小鱼在金色的水草中游来游去。

“当然，房子是很小的。”艾略特说道，“可是亨利告诉我，说室内装修花了他十万块。对普通人来说，这可是数目很大的一笔钱。”

婚礼很气派，在圣公会教会允许的范围内极尽奢华。

“跟巴黎圣母院里举行的那种婚礼有所不同，”艾略特带着几分自豪告诉我说，“但就新教的婚礼来说，却是别具一格。”

报纸对婚礼高调进行了报道，艾略特剪下几条，做出一副漫不经意的样子丢给我看。他还让我看了新人的结婚照——伊莎贝尔穿着新娘服装，有些胖，然而很漂亮；格雷是个大块头，但身材不错，穿一身结婚的礼服，显得有点不自在。还有一张新婚夫妇和伴娘们的合影，一张小两口跟布雷德利夫人、艾略特一起拍的照片——布雷德利夫人穿一件华贵的衣服；艾略特把他的新帽子拿在手里，风度翩翩，那种高雅的劲儿简直无法比拟。我问他布雷德利夫人的身体状况怎样。

“瘦了许多，脸色不尽如人意，但身体状况还是挺好的。当然，婚事叫她操尽了心，好在现已办完，她总算能彻底休息休息了。”

一年后，伊莎贝尔生了一个女儿，根据当时流行的名字，取名叫琼；隔了两年，她又生了一个女儿，还是根据当时流行的名字，取名叫普里西拉。

亨利·马图林的一个合伙人死了，另外两个合伙人在重压之下不久也退休了。公司原来就由着他独断专行，而今更成了他一人的天下。多年的抱负一朝实现。他让儿子和他一道经营，公司出现了空前繁荣的景象。

“他们赚钱易如反掌，老伙计。”艾略特对我说道，“呵，格雷才二十五岁，一年就能赚五万块。而且，这还只是开了个头。美国的财富是永不枯竭的。这种繁荣并非昙花一现，而是一个伟大国家的常态。”

他的胸中泛起了少见的爱国主义热情。

“亨利·马图林不可能永远活下去。要知道，他患有高血压。格雷到了四十岁时，将坐拥两千万元的资产。那可是富比王侯，老伙计，富比王侯呀。”

艾略特和姐姐之间家书不断。一年一年的时光悄然流逝，他时不时会把姐姐告诉他的事情讲给我听。格雷和伊莎贝尔生活幸福，两个孩子活泼可爱。他们一家的生活方式叫艾略特赞不绝口，说完全合乎他们的社会地位——请客请得风风光光，别人请他们也排场阔气。艾略特非常满意地告诉我，说他们三个月里单独吃饭吃不上一次。后来，由于马图林夫人的离世，这种快活的日子戛然而止。亨利·马图林当初娶那位面无血色、高颧骨的女人，是想利用她的社会关系，好在芝加哥有一席之地，因为他父亲是农村来的乡巴佬，指望不上。为了纪念马图林夫人，小两口儿有一年的工夫，请客吃饭一次顶多只请六个人。

“我一直认为请客请八个人最为合适。”艾略特看问题看的是乐观的一面，于是这样说道，“八个人气氛融和，利于交谈，同时给人的印象是够得上宴会的规模。”

格雷对妻子慷慨得出奇，生第一胎时，送给她一枚四面都经过打磨的钻石戒指，生第二胎，赠给她的是一件紫貂皮大衣。由于太忙，他很少离开芝加哥。中间如果能休息几天，他们全家就会到亨利·马图林在马文的那幢豪宅里度假。亨利爱儿子，有求必应。一次过圣诞节的时候，他把在南卡罗来纳州买的一处农场送给了儿子——这样儿子可以在狩猎季节到那儿去打两个星期的野鸭子。

“当然，我们的商业巨头跟意大利文艺复兴时期靠商业发财的那些伟大的艺术赞助人很相似。就拿美第奇家族来说吧——甚至就连法国的两个国王也放下身段跟这个显赫家族的千金联姻。可以预见，总有一天，欧洲的君主会跑到美国来，向这个金元帝国的公主求婚的。正如诗人雪莱所说：‘世界的伟大时代重又降临，黄金的岁月回来了。’[67]”

多年来，布雷德利夫人和艾略特的投资都交给亨利·马图林打理，姐弟俩对他的眼光深信不疑。亨利从不冒风险搞投机，而是将他们的钱都放在可靠的股票上。由于股票的价值大涨，他们的投资也水涨船高，小小的几笔钱增加了许多，让他们又惊又喜。艾略特告诉我，说他连一根手指头都没有动，一九一八年投进去的钱，至一九二六年便几乎翻了一倍。他已经六十五岁，两鬓霜染，脸上有皱纹，眼睛下面出现了眼袋，但他没有向岁月屈服，仍保持着身材瘦削、腰杆笔挺。他历来都很注意自己的生活习惯，注意自己的外表。只要能够有伦敦最好的裁缝给他做衣服，有自己的特约理发师为他理发修面，有按摩师天天早晨上门按摩，使他的优美体形保持良好的状态，他就绝不会任由时光摆弄自己。他早已欣然淡忘自己已沦落于商贾之流，而倾向于暗示自己年轻时曾在外交界供职，不过他从不把话说得很明白，因为他并不愚蠢，不会就这一点撒谎，免得日后被人戳穿。我得承认，如果我有机会描写一位大使的话，我会毫不迟疑地选艾略特做我的模本。

但是，世道在变。当初对艾略特有提携之恩的显贵女性，有些仍活着，却年事已高。那些英国的贵族夫人，在她们的爵爷去世后，只得把府邸让给媳妇，自己住进切尔滕纳姆的别墅或者摄政公园里的普通房屋。斯塔福德府邸改造成了博物馆，柯曾宅院成了一个机构的办事处，德文郡的衙门如今在出售。艾略特在考斯时经常乘坐的那艘游艇已转手他人。眼下唱主角的那些弄潮儿觉得艾略特老儿已成了无用的废物，认为他是个荒唐可笑的老厌物。他们仍旧愿意参加他在克拉里奇酒店举办的盛大午宴，但艾略特眼光敏锐，看得出他们来赴宴，只是想彼此见见面，而非来看望他。过去，写字台上满是请帖，由着他挑选，而今那样的情形已不复存在。他常常独自一人在酒店房间里用餐，这种丢人的事情他可不愿叫外人知道。在英国，有地位的女人一旦出了丑闻，就会被社交界拒之门外，她们转而会对艺术产生兴趣，召集画家、作家和音乐家围绕于身边。艾略特心高气傲，绝不愿委屈自己，与之为伍。

“遗产税和战争投机商把英国社交界给毁掉了。”他对我说道，“人们好像对于和什么人来往全不在乎。按说，伦敦的裁缝和鞋帽匠还是不错的。我相信我死之前会一直如此。除了这一点好处之外，这座城市便一无是处了。老伙计，圣艾尔斯家要女佣伺候饭桌，这你知道吗？”

这话是他和我在卡尔顿府邸吃完午宴，离开时讲的。就在那天的午宴上，发生了一桩不幸事件。尊贵的东道主在藏画上小有名气，午宴上有个年轻的美国客人，名叫保罗·巴顿，此人提出想看看他的藏画。

“你是不是有幅提香[68]的画？”

“曾经有过。现在，这幅画在美国呢。一个犹太佬出一大笔钱买它，而我们家当时手头正拮据，所以老爷子就把它卖了。”

我注意到艾略特一边支棱起耳朵听，一边把谈笑风生的侯爵狠狠瞪了一眼，于是便猜到那个买画人就是艾略特。他这么个出身于弗吉尼亚，祖先曾在《独立宣言》上签过字的人，竟然听见自己遭到如此奚落，简直都快把肺气炸了。他有生以来从未受过这样的奇耻大辱。最叫他受不了的是，挑起事端的是他恨之入骨的保罗·巴顿。这个年轻人战后不久便来到了伦敦。他二十三岁的年纪，金发碧眼，一表人才，风度翩翩，跳舞跳得好，手里很有钱。他拿了一封信来见艾略特，艾略特素来有善心，就把他介绍给了自己的好多朋友。这还不够，他还为他指点迷津，给了他一些宝贵的忠告。根据自己的亲身经历，艾略特向他传授经验，说只要对年龄大的贵妇人献献殷勤，对显贵人物说的话，不管怎样腻味，都应该洗耳恭听，这样，即便是一个举目无亲的人也能跻身于社交界。

可是，保罗·巴顿步入的社交界和几十年前艾略特·邓普顿费尽千辛万苦才钻进去的社交界完全是两个世界。这个世界只追欢寻乐。保罗·巴顿豪情满怀、仪表堂堂、风度翩翩，没用几个星期便有了效果，其成就不亚于艾略特多年的苦心经营。很快，他便不需要艾略特的提携了，对此他也没有做出样子加以掩饰。两人见面时，保罗·巴顿仍然说些开心的话，但语气却漫不经心，深深刺伤了这位老者的自尊。艾略特请客，不是视自己是否喜欢，而是看对方能不能给宴会增辉，鉴于保罗·巴顿人缘不错，所以每星期设午宴仍旧请他。不过，这个成功的年轻人一般都有约会，有两次到了最后时刻才告知艾略特，给艾略特弄个措手不及。这种事艾略特本人过去也经常做，哪能不知底细——保罗·巴顿显然是刚刚收到了一份更具吸引力的邀请。

“我也不要求你相信我的话，”艾略特气哼哼地对我说，“但事实如此——他竟然想在我面前摆谱。我是谁呀！还谈什么提香不提香。”说到此处，艾略特一副气急败坏的样子，“就是把提香的画放在他面前，他也不见得能认出来。”

我从来没见过艾略特生这么大的气。据我猜想，他之所以动怒，是因为他觉得保罗·巴顿问起这张画是出于恶意；这个年轻人不知从哪儿获悉艾略特买了这幅画，于是就想利用那位贵族老爷的回答拿艾略特开涮。

“他是个厚颜无耻的市侩，天下我最痛恨、最瞧不起的就是这种势利小人。要不是我，他狗屁都不是。相信不相信，他的父亲是做办公家具的。办公家具！”说最后几个字的时候，他的语气十分轻蔑，“我告诫人们，说他在美国是个无名之辈，出身极其寒酸，可是他们好像并不在乎。请记住我的话，老伙计，英国的社交界算是完了，跟渡渡鸟[69]一个样。”

依艾略特看，法国的情形也好不到哪儿去。他年轻时结识的那些贵妇人，即便仍活着，也是沉迷于打桥牌（他最讨厌的一种牌戏）、做祈祷和照料孙辈。如今，工厂主们、阿根廷人、智利人以及那些和丈夫分居或者离了婚的美国妇女，却住进了贵族那富丽堂皇的府邸，请客吃饭，极尽奢华之能事。叫艾略特所不齿的是，在他们举办的宴会上，见到的都是些说起法语俗不可耐的政客、要吃相没吃相要坐相没坐相的记者，甚至还有戏子。侯门家的少爷娶个商店店主的小家碧玉，并不觉得丢人。诚然，巴黎是欢乐之都，但这种欢乐是何等缺乏品味！年轻人们追求的是纸醉金迷、灯红酒绿，认为最有趣的生活莫过于走进一家空间狭小、乌烟瘴气的夜总会，花一百法郎喝一瓶香槟酒，挤在不三不四的人群里跳舞，一直跳到次日凌晨五点钟。烟气、热气、嘈杂声，这些叫艾略特感到头痛。眼前的巴黎不再是他三十年前心目中的精神家园，不再是有品位的美国人渴望在死后升入的天堂。

艾略特是个有眼光的人。一位知情人告诉他，说里维埃拉就要重新成为贵族和上层人物的休闲之地了。过去由于在教廷供职，他从罗马回来，途中常要在蒙特卡洛的巴黎饭店住上几天，或者到戛纳去，在哪个朋友的别墅里待一待，所以对那一带海滨相当熟悉。不过，那都是在冬天。近来却听到传言，说那儿正在成为一个非常理想的消夏胜地。那些大旅馆夏天仍旧营业；夏季贵宾的名字登载进了巴黎《先锋报》的交际栏——那一个个熟悉的名字，艾略特看了满心喜悦。

“滚滚红尘，叫人不胜烦恼。”他说，“我已是一把岁数的人了，也该享受享受山水之乐了。”

这话说得没头没尾，有点言不由衷。他一直认为游乐山水是社交生活的一大障碍。有些人眼前明明放着一件摄政时代的古董或者华托的一幅名画不好好欣赏，却跑去游山玩水，这叫他无法容忍。当时，他手头有着一笔数额可观的现金。话说亨利·马图林一方面因儿子力劝，一方面看见那些做证券交易的朋友一夜暴富，不由红了眼，终于向潮流屈服，渐渐放弃了他那套陈旧的保守主义，觉得自己没有理由不搭上这趟顺风车。他写信给艾略特，说他仍旧和过去一样反对赌博，但证券交易并非赌博，而是对祖国坚定的信任，相信祖国有着永不枯竭的财源。他的乐观是有道理的。他认为任何力量都阻挡不住美国前进的步伐。在信的结尾处，他说他凭保证金额度为亲爱的路易莎·布雷德利买进了一些安全股票，而且很高兴告诉艾略特，她现在已经赚入两万块钱了。末了，他说艾略特如果想赚点零钱，让他根据自己的判断行事，保证不会叫艾略特失望。遇到这种事，艾略特总喜欢找些借口搪塞，说什么他抵挡不住眼前的诱惑。多年来，当《先锋报》随着早餐一道送入他的房间时，他都是先看社交界的消息，而自从读了亨利·马图林的来信之后，他首先注意的就是证券市场的报道了。亨利·马图林代表他做的那些交易非常成功，使他不费吹灰之力便拿到了五万块可观的收益。

他决定把这笔钱拿上，在里维埃拉买一幢房子。他选中昂第布作为一处避世的港湾。那地方位于戛纳和蒙特卡洛之间，可进可退，具有战略意义，方便游走于那两地。后来，昂第布没多久便成了上流社会的中心，他的选择不知是出于天意，还是受到内心本能的驱使，谁也说不清。住在一个带花园的乡村别墅里，脱不了城市近郊的那种庸俗气，让讲究品味的他觉得倒胃口，于是他跑到旧城区临海的地方买了两幢房子，再将两幢并为一幢，安装上中央暖气系统、浴室和卫生设备——这些都是顽固的欧洲大陆受到美国影响的产物。当时正流行酸洗，所以他把古老的普罗旺斯家具全都酸洗过，再用现代纺织品蒙上，摆放在屋里，在某种程度上也算赶了赶时髦。对于毕加索[70]、布拉克[71]这类现代派画家，他却仍然难以接受。“不成样子，老伙计，不成样子！”他会这样嗟叹。他觉得这些画家都是缺心眼的评论家制造舆论捧起来的。但是他对印象派画家却青睐有加，并认为自己眼光独到，于是他家的墙上便挂了一些花花绿绿的印象派画作。我记得其中有一张莫奈[72]的人们在河里划船的画；一张毕沙罗[73]画的塞纳河的码头和桥；一张高更的塔希提岛风景；一张雷诺阿[74]画的少女侧像，黄头发从背上披下来，很令人着迷。等到房子修整完毕，真是焕然一新，叫人赏心悦目，不同凡响而又朴素无华——那种朴素，是费尽心思才取得的效果。

自此，艾略特步入了自己一生中最辉煌的时期。他从巴黎把他那位厨艺超群的厨子带了来，不久大家便公认他家的饭菜在里维埃拉口味最好。艾府的管家和男仆全都是一身白装，肩上挂着金带。他请客讲究排场，但有一定的底线，从不庸俗。在地中海沿岸，欧洲各地来的王公贵族处处可见，有的是喜欢这儿的气候，有的是逃亡来的，有的是因为不堪丑闻的纠缠，有的是婚姻出现问题，觉得不如定居于这一片异国的土地。人群中有俄国的罗曼诺夫皇族、奥地利的哈布斯堡王族、西班牙的波旁王族、两个西西里贵族和一个帕尔马贵族，另外还有温莎王室的公主、布拉干萨王室的公主，有瑞典的王室和希腊的王公贵族。对于这些人，艾略特敞开大门欢迎。对于那些从奥地利、意大利、西班牙、俄罗斯、比利时来的没有王室血统的王子和公主，公爵和公爵夫人，侯爵和侯爵夫人，艾略特也都设宴款待。冬季，瑞典国王和丹麦国王来海滨小住，西班牙的阿方索国王也不时地来匆匆一游，艾略特对他们迎迓不及。他鞠躬迎接这些高贵人物不卑不亢的样子历来都叫我佩服有加，因为他既能表现得彬彬有礼，又能保持一个声称人人生来平等的国度里的公民所具有的独立人格。

游荡了几年之后，此时我在费拉角买了幢房屋定居了下来，于是和艾略特见面的机会就多了。我的地位在他眼中很荣幸已经升得很高，所以，他有时候也请我参加他举办的最为盛大的宴会。

“来吧，老伙计，算是帮我的忙了。”他会这样对我说，“当然，你我都清楚，王公贵族在宴会上只会叫人败兴。不过，有些人还是想会会他们的，我觉得自己有责任照顾照顾那些可怜人的面子。只有上天知道，他们是不配的，因为他们是世界上最忘恩负义的人。这些人是要利用你，而一旦你对他们没有用时，便会将你视若敝屣。你给予他们千百种恩惠，他们也不会感恩，哪怕是举手之劳的忙也不会帮你的。”

艾略特绞尽脑汁和当地的权贵搞好关系，因此，区长、教区主教以及主教代理就成了他家常来常往的座上宾。主教在进教会之前是个骑兵军官，第一次世界大战期间指挥过一个骑兵团。他脸色红润，身材胖大，讲话粗鲁、率直，一副军队里的腔调，这叫表情严肃、面容枯槁的主教代理总是如坐针毡，生怕他会说出有伤大雅的话来。主教很喜欢讲故事，这位代理在听的时候，脸上会堆起不以为然的微笑。不过，主教大人在管理教区方面能力过人。他布道时口若悬河、动人心扉，餐桌旁则妙语如珠，给大家带来了欢乐。艾略特对教会的虔诚以及慷慨布施令他很是欣赏，他喜欢艾略特的和蔼可亲以及艾略特提供的美味佳肴。二人成了好朋友。艾略特扬扬得意，说他在天地两世界都游刃有余，而按照我的说法是，他拜上帝和拜金两不误，取得了理想的平衡。

艾略特对自己的房子颇感自豪，急于向姐姐炫耀炫耀。他总觉得姐姐在赞扬他时，肚子里留了三分话。他想让她看看自己如今过得是多么风光，想让她见见自己新结交的朋友。姐姐来了一看，所有的疑惑都会消失的，会承认他干得不错。他写信给她，让她带着格雷和伊莎贝尔一同来——不是住在他的府上，因为府上没有空房间，而是以他的客人身份住进近旁的“海角旅馆”。布雷德利夫人写了回信，说她已经过了旅行的年龄，因为健康欠佳，想想还是待在家里养病好；格雷在芝加哥是怎么也脱不了身的，他生意兴隆，财源滚滚，忙得只好留在国内了。艾略特跟姐姐感情很深，这封信使他慌张起来。他又给伊莎贝尔写了封信。对方回了封电报，说母亲身体虽然很不好，每星期得卧床一天，但目前还没有危险，其实，如果当心一点，完全还能活很长时间；不过，格雷倒需要休息休息，国内的生意有他父亲照看着呢，他自己有理由度一段时间的假；今年夏天算是不行了，明年她和格雷一定来。

一九二九年十月二十三日，纽约证券市场崩溃了。





五


当时，我正在伦敦。我们身处英国，起初没有意识到情况是多么严重，后果会是多么叫人心灰意冷。就我自己而言，虽然对损失了相当大的一笔钱感到烦恼，但损失的大部分是票面利润，等到尘埃落定，我发现自己的现款并无缩水。我知道艾略特买股票下的赌注很大，担心他会受到沉重打击。可是，我一直没有和他见面。直到过圣诞节，我们重返里维埃拉，才得以相见。他告诉我，亨利·马图林死了，格雷破产了。

我对做生意一窍不通，艾略特给我讲述了事件的经过，听得我一头雾水。我只觉得之所以大难临头，一半要怪亨利·马图林一意孤行，一半要怪格雷急躁冒进。亨利·马图林开头不相信事情会那么严重，认为只不过是纽约股票经纪人玩的小把戏，无非是想从别的地方的同行身上榨点油出来，于是咬紧牙关拿出大笔的钱来支撑市场。芝加哥的经纪人们被纽约的那些无赖吓得屁滚尿流，这叫他十分生气。他的那些小客户——有固定进项的寡妇、退伍的军官等，过去听从他的建议，不曾损失过一分钱，他以此而感到自豪，现在为了不使他们受到损失，就自己掏腰包给他们的账户注入资金。他说大不了就是破产么，他还可以东山再起；但是，如果让信任他的小客户蒙受损失，他就永远也无法抬起头来做人了。他自以为有一副侠肝义胆，然而却挽不住狂澜，偌大的家产投进去，顷刻化为乌有。一天夜里，他的心脏病突然发作。他已是六十多岁的人了，平时劳累过度，暴饮暴食，经过几个小时痛苦的挣扎，最终因冠状动脉栓塞而溘然长逝。

只剩下格雷一人独立面对危局。这之前，他在投机生意上广泛涉入，父亲对此一无所知，而今他自己也深陷债务危机。他千方百计想摆脱困境，但最终归于失败。银行不肯贷款给他，交易所里老一辈的人告诉他，说仅有一条路可走了——低头认输。其余的情况我就不太清楚了。可能他无法履行还债的义务，于是便宣告破产了。他家的房子此前早已抵押了出去，这时便乖乖将房子交给了债权人。他父亲在湖滨道的房子以及马文的那套房子均折价卖了出去。伊莎贝尔把首饰也卖了个精光。南卡罗来纳州的那个农场成了他们仅有的财产（此农场过户在伊莎贝尔的名下），想卖也找不到买主。格雷成了一文不名的穷光蛋。

“你的情况怎么样，艾略特？”我问道。

“哦，我倒没什么可抱怨的。”他语气轻松地回答道，“承蒙老天垂怜。”

我没有打破砂锅问到底，因为他的经济情况与我无关。但不管怎样，他跟我们大家一样肯定也蒙受了损失。

经济大萧条的恶潮起初对里维埃拉的冲击还不算大。后来听说有两三户人家损失惨重，许多别墅冬季都关门闭户，有几家还挂出了牌子出售。旅馆冷冷清清，蒙特卡洛的赌场牢骚满腹，说生意惨淡。不过，一直到两年之后，里维埃拉才真正感受到了这场飓风的影响。一个地产商告诉我，说从土伦到意大利边界的地中海沿岸，大大小小有四万八千处房地产要出售。

赌场的股票跌到了谷底。大型旅馆压低价钱以吸引顾客，却无济于事。能看得见的外国游客，全都是些穷得不能再穷的人。他们分文不花，因为他们压根就没有钱可花。商铺的老板们个个都大失所望。而艾略特与别人不同，他既没有辞退自家的仆人，也没有减少他们的工资。他继续用好酒好菜招待那些王公贵族，还买了一辆崭新的大汽车，是从美国进口的，为此付了很大一笔关税。主教大人组织慈善活动，给失业家庭施舍义餐，他为之慷慨解囊。事实上，他一如既往，好像压根没发生经济危机似的，好像半个世界没有因此被冲击得摇摇晃晃似的。

后来，我无意中发现了其中的原因：艾略特此时除掉一年一度去伦敦两个星期购置衣服外，已经不去英国了，然而他仍旧每年秋天回巴黎在自己的公寓里住三个月，五月和六月也在巴黎度过，因为这几个月里他的朋友们是不去里维埃拉的；他喜欢里维埃拉的夏天，部分原因是能洗海水浴，而我觉得主要是因为炎热的天气使他有机会穿上五颜六色的衣服放松一下，平时，为了顾及体统，他是不能这样做的。这时候，他会穿上颜色鲜艳的裤子（红的、蓝的、绿的或者黄的），配上色调形成鲜明对比的汗衫（淡紫色的、蓝紫色的、深褐色的或者杂色的），接受人们对衣服的恭维，神情不以为然，谦虚得就像一个女演员听见人家说她扮演一个新角色演得非常成功一样。

那年春天，在返回费拉角的途中，我在巴黎待了一天，邀艾略特和我一同吃午饭。我们在里茨酒吧见了面。此处一片冷清，不见了从美国跑来寻乐子的大学生，就和一出戏剧初演之夜便砸了锅的情形一样人去屋空。我们喝了一杯鸡尾酒（此为美国人的习惯，艾略特最终还是无奈地接受了），然后点了饭菜。酒足饭饱，他建议一同去逛逛古玩店。我声称自己钱囊羞涩，但愿意舍命陪君子。我们步行穿过旺多姆广场，他问我愿意不愿意跟他到查维特服饰店去一趟——他在那家店里定做了几件衣服，想问问做好了没有。原来，他订的是几件内衣内裤，上面要用手工绣上他的姓名的缩写字母。内衣尚未做好，内裤已完工，店员问他要不要看一下。

“那就看看吧。”他说道。趁着店员去拿内裤的时候，他对我说道：“我让他们缝衣服时加上我的图案。”

内裤拿来了，和我平时在麦西服装店买的一个样子，只不过料子是丝绸罢了。但我注意到，在E.T.两个缩写字母的上方绣着一个伯爵的冠饰。我看了，却一句话也没说。

“非常漂亮，非常漂亮。”艾略特说，“等内衣做好，一同给我送去。”

出了衣服店，离开那儿时，艾略特笑盈盈地转过脸对我说：

“注意到那个冠饰了吗？实话说，我拉你来查维特服饰店的时候，把这个给忘了。我一直没机会告诉你：教皇陛下给我面子，仁慈地恢复了我家古老的头衔。”

“恢复了什么？”我诧异地问，完全忘掉了提问时应该委婉些。

艾略特不满地抬起了眉毛。

“你不知道吗？我母系那一方是劳里亚伯爵的后代，他是随从菲力普二世到英国来的，并且娶了玛丽王后的一个侍女。”

“就是那个血腥玛丽[75]吗？”

“我认为这是异教徒对她的称呼。”艾略特有点尴尬地说，“恐怕我没有告诉过你，一九二九年的九月我是在罗马度过的。我觉得去罗马是件很乏味的事情，因为那儿几乎成了空城。不过，幸亏我的责任感战胜了我追求世俗享乐的欲望。当时，梵蒂冈的朋友告诉我，说经济大崩溃就要来了，力劝我卖掉手头所有美国的股票。天主教会拥有两千年之久的智慧，所以我一刻也没有耽搁，马上拍电报给亨利·马图林，叫他把所有的股票全卖掉，购入黄金。我还发了封电报给路易莎，让她也如此办理。亨利·马图林回电问我是不是疯了，说除非我再发一封电报证实我的指示，否则他什么也不会做。我立刻又发了封电报，以极为强硬的语气，要他按我说的做，然后回电报把结果告诉我。可怜的路易莎没有听我的话，因此栽了跟头。”

“这么说，大崩溃降临时，你毛发未损？”

“这是美式用语，劝你还是别用的好。不过，用它来形容我那时的状况，倒是十分贴切的。我一分钱也没损失，实际上还捡了些便宜（你也许会称之为油水吧）。过了一段时期以后，我只花了很少一点钱就把原来卖掉的那些股票全买回来了。我认为只能把这种现象叫作上帝的直接干预，于是觉得应该做点事情来报答上帝，这样才合乎情理。”

“哦，那你是怎样报答的呢？”

“这个嘛，你知道教廷在蓬蒂内沼泽[76]开垦了大片的土地，他们告诉我，说教皇陛下对那边的居民缺少一个做礼拜的地方深感焦虑。简而言之，我出资在那儿建了一座罗马式教堂，和我在普罗旺斯看到的一座一模一样，每一个部分都异常完美，可以说是一枚灿烂的明珠。教堂是奉献给圣马丁[77]的。说来话长，一次，我有幸发现了一扇古香古色的反映圣马丁事迹的彩色玻璃窗，画面上的圣马丁将自己的长袍割成两半，一半给了一位光身子的乞丐让他遮体。我觉得这幅画很有象征意义，于是把玻璃窗买下，后来镶嵌在了主祭坛的上方。”我没有打断艾略特的话。但我不明白圣马丁的那种世人皆知的善举和艾略特的行为之间有什么联系——他只不过瞅准时机卖掉股票大捞了一把，从中取出一部分小钱贡献给上帝，就像是给代理人的回扣似的。不过，我这种人毕竟是俗胎凡眼，看不透其中的象征意义罢了。艾略特继续说道：

“一次受到教皇陛下的接见，我把教堂和彩色玻璃的照片拿给他看。他圣颜大悦，说他一眼就看出我是个很有品味的人，并且说在这个世风日下的时代能发现一个既忠于教会，又具有如此罕见艺术修养的人，让他感到很高兴。当时的情景叫人终生难忘，老伙计，终生难忘呀。但最让我感到意外的是，过后不久便有人通知我，说教皇陛下有心赐给我一个爵位。我是个美国公民，觉得还是谦虚些好，除非在梵蒂冈，在别的地方就不用这个头衔了。所以我禁止我的仆人约瑟夫称我为伯爵大人[78]。我相信你会尊重我的隐私的。我不想把此事张扬出去。可是，我又不愿让教皇陛下觉得我不珍重他赐给我的荣誉，所以我把冠饰绣在我个人的衬衣上，这完全是出于对他的尊敬。可以这样说：我把爵位的标记不显山不露水地缝在内衣上，既是谦虚的表现，又透露出自豪感。”

我们分手了。艾略特告诉我，说他将于六月底到里维埃拉来。可是他却没有如约而来。原因是这样的：当时他刚刚做好安排把仆人们从巴黎调往里维埃拉，而他本人准备开车过来，消消停停的，这样抵达里维埃拉时，便已万事俱备了；就在此时，伊莎贝尔来了封电报，说她的母亲病情突然加重。我在上文便说过，艾略特喜欢他的姐姐，家族感情非常强。他立刻从瑟堡乘船到了纽约，再从那儿返回芝加哥。他写信告诉我，说布雷德利夫人病得很厉害，瘦得不成人样，着实吓了他一跳。也许她还能活上几个星期，甚至几个月，可是不论怎样，他觉得自己有责任给她送终——不管这种责任是多么痛苦。他说芝加哥的高温比他预计的要容易忍受得多，然而却缺乏惬意的社交活动，不过这也没什么关系，因为这种时刻他反正没有心思与人交往。他说他的国人对经济萧条的反应令他感到失望，因为他原以为国人会以比较平静的心态对待这场灾难呢。看见别人遭难，以泰然的语气说些大话，这是再容易不过了。我觉得艾略特比他一生中任何时候都要富有，恐怕没资格对别人要求这样苛刻。最后，他请我把情况转告给他的几个朋友，并且请我务必记着向所有碰见的人解释，为什么他的府邸今年夏天没有开门迎客。

过了不到一个月的时间，我又收到他的一封信，说布雷德利夫人过世了，词句写得悲痛，充满了深情。我早就认为尽管他为人势利，而且有许多荒唐做作的地方，但他仍不失为一个善良、多情和诚实的人，所以便觉得这样一封真诚、动情和单纯的信是出自于一片真心。他在信中告诉我，说在处理布雷德利夫人的丧事时乱事如麻。布雷德利夫人的长子是个外交官，由于驻日大使离任，他临时代理东京的外交事务[79]，一时抽不出身奔丧。她的次子叫邓普顿，我最初认识布雷德利一家时，他在菲律宾群岛供职，后来调回华盛顿，并在国务院担任要职。母亲病危时，他带着妻子来到芝加哥，但母亲一下葬，便立刻返回了首都。遇到这种情况，艾略特觉得自己应该待在美国把后事料理完再说。布雷德利夫人把财产平均分成三份，给了她的三个孩子。不过，看上去，她在一九二九年经济大崩溃时遭受了重大损失。幸好马文的那个农场有了买主。艾略特在信中把农场说成是“亲爱的路易莎的乡间别墅”。

“一户人家最后落得变卖祖屋，难免令人唏嘘。”他在信中写到，“不过，近年来眼见得许多英国朋友都被迫出此下策，我也就觉得两个外甥和伊莎贝尔必须以同样的勇气以及听天由命的态度接受这种不可避免的后果了。有权利就有义务。[80]”

他们运气好，把布雷德利夫人在芝加哥的房子也处理掉了。其实，早有人计划着要把布雷德利夫人以及其他几户人家住的那排房屋拆掉，在原址上建一幢大型公寓楼，但是，布雷德利夫人非常顽固，坚持要死在自己住的房子里，所以这个计划始终没有实现。布雷德利夫人一断气，就有中间人跑来提出要买房子，布家立刻就接受了。可尽管有了这笔钱，伊莎贝尔还是觉得不够用。

经济大崩溃之后，格雷试图找份工作干，哪怕为那些挺过了灾难的经纪人效力，在办公室当个小职员也可以，但屡屡碰壁。他找老朋友帮忙，想弄个差事做，不管地位多么卑贱，薪水多么低都可以，仍无果而终。为了度过这场灾难，他拼命挣扎，再加上忧虑过度和内心蒙受的屈辱，导致他的神经最终崩溃。他有时头痛欲裂，昼夜不息，头痛症一旦过去，便浑身软绵绵的，像面条一样。伊莎贝尔无奈之中，觉得只好先带着孩子举家前往南卡罗来纳州的那个农场暂住，等格雷恢复了健康再作计较。农场有过兴盛期，一年靠出产大米亦有十万块钱的进项，后来撂荒，成了一片泽国和荒林，对喜欢打野鸭的猎手才能派上用场，想脱手也苦于找不到买主。大崩溃发生后，他们偶尔在那儿住住，现在打算回到农场去，待情况转好，格雷能找到工作再说。

“我不能叫他们过那样的日子，”艾略特在信中写到，“老伙计，那是牲口一样的日子——伊莎贝尔没有贴身女佣，孩子没有家庭教师，只有两个黑种女人料理家务。我提出把我在巴黎的那套公寓让给他们住，等到这个风雨飘摇的国家形势改观之后再说。我将会给他们雇几个用人。其实，我厨房里的女佣烧得一手好菜，可以留给他们用，我自己完全能够再找一个代替她。他们所有的开销都由我负担，伊莎贝尔的那一点点进项，就让她买些衣服以及给家里买点好吃好喝的。当然，这意味着我在里维埃拉的时间要比以前多得多了，希望能多见见你，老伙计。伦敦和巴黎现在成了这个样子，我觉得还是住在里维埃拉自在些。里维埃拉成了唯一的一块净土，在这儿，我可以会会和自己有共同语言的人。巴黎当然也还会去的，偶尔住上几天。不过，即便去了巴黎，我也不在乎在里茨饭店凑合凑合。我可以很高兴地告诉你，我总算不枉费口舌，让格雷和伊莎贝尔接受了我的要求。把必要的事宜安排妥当，我立刻就带他们过来。那些家具和油画非常差劲，老伙计，真伪难辨，再过上一个星期就卖掉它们。我怕他们住在家里伤心，已经把他们带了来，目前和我一道暂住在德雷克饭店。过后去巴黎，我把他们安顿好，就回到里维埃拉去。别忘记替我向你的皇家邻居问好。”

无可否认，艾略特虽然是天字号的势利眼，然而也是最善良、最体贴、最慷慨的一个人！





第四章


一


艾略特把马图林一家安顿在左岸自己的那套宽敞的公寓里，于岁尾返回了里维埃拉。里维埃拉的这套房子在设计上适合于他一人居住，无法再容纳一个四口之家，所以即便他想请那一家子来跟自己住在一起，也是办不到的。对此，他恐怕也并不觉得遗憾。他心里很清楚：凡是请客的，都愿意请一个独居的人，而不愿请由外甥女和外甥女婿相陪的人；至于他自己举办宴会（他在这方面是很费心机的），家里老有两个房客，也别指望能把宴会办得多么出色。

“他们还是住在巴黎要好得多，适应适应文明社会的生活。再说，那两个小姑娘也到了上学的年龄，我找到一所学校，离公寓不远。那是个百里挑一的好学校。”

由于这个缘故，直到第二年春天我才见到了伊莎贝尔。当时，有些事情需要办理，得在巴黎待上几个星期，我便在旺多姆广场近旁的一家旅馆租了两个房间。我是这家旅馆的常客，不仅仅是为了图方便，也是因为这儿弥漫着一种情调。这是一所高门大户、年代悠久的房宅，围成一圈，中心有个院落，作为旅馆接客已有近两百年的历史了。旅馆里的浴室远远称不上奢华，抽水马桶远远不能叫人满意；寝室里放着铁架子床，漆成白色，上面铺着老式的白床罩，还有一面大衣橱，上边镶着镜子，所有的一切都透出一股寒酸气；不过，客厅里的摆设却精致漂亮、古色古香。长沙发和扶手椅是拿破仑三世那个追求奢华时代的产物，不能说舒适，但外观华丽，挺好看的。坐在客厅里，仿佛时光倒流，回到了法国小说家描写的久远岁月里。看一看玻璃罩里的那架帝国式时钟，我联想到了一位美丽女子，头发梳成小发卷，穿一件荷叶边连衣裙，一面望着时钟的长针，一面等候着拉斯蒂涅克的来访——此君是巴尔扎克笔下的一个冒险家，起自贫寒，终成显赫人物。巴尔扎克用几部小说的篇幅描写了他的人生经历。比安松医生也是巴尔扎克塑造的人物，那样栩栩如生，以至于巴尔扎克临死时还说：“只有比安松医生能救我的命了。”那位医生很可能来过这个客厅，为一个外省的贵族寡妇把过脉、看过舌苔——那寡妇来巴黎找律师打官司，偶染微恙，请医生看治。在那张写字台前，也许坐过一个穿撑裙的痴情女子，头发对中分开，正在给她的负心情人写一封情意绵绵的信；或者坐过一个愤怒的老者，穿一件绿颜色的双排扣常礼服，正在写信斥责他那挥霍无度的儿子。

抵达巴黎的第二天，我给伊莎贝尔打了个电话，说我五点钟去看望她，问她能不能请我喝杯茶。我已经有十年没有见过她了。一个脸色凝重的管家把我领进客厅时，她正在看一本法国小说。见了我，她起身迎接，握住我的双手，绽出灿烂、迷人的微笑。我和她过去见面顶多不过十一二次，而且只有两次单独在一起，但她让我立刻觉得我们是老朋友，而非泛泛之交。十年的时光倏然流逝，缩短了一个年轻女子和一个中年男子之间的鸿沟，我不再觉得我们的年龄存在着十分大的差异了。她俨然是一个见过世面的女子，语气委婉地对我说些入耳的话，待我如同龄人一般。没出五分钟，我们便坦坦荡荡，无话不谈了，就好像我们是童年时的玩伴，经常见面，从没有间断过似的。此时的她处事泰然，落落大方，充满了自信。

然而，最叫我感到意外的是她容貌上的变化。在我的记忆中，她是个漂亮、活泼，一不小心就会发胖的女孩子。不知道是她意识到了这一点而不屈不挠地采取措施进行减肥，还是因为生孩子而产生了意想不到的可喜效果，反正她现在有一个人人都渴望具备的苗条身段。她的一身装束更突出了这一点。她穿着一身黑色丝绸衣，既不十分朴素也不十分华丽，我一眼就看出是在巴黎的一家顶级服装店定做的，被她随随便便、漫不经心地穿在身上，那股劲儿就好像她天生应该穿高档服装似的。

十年前，尽管有艾略特为她指点迷津，她的穿着仍不够典雅，而且那样的行头好像老让她觉得不自在。而现在，就是玛丽·路易丝·德·弗洛里蒙在跟前，也不能说她缺乏品味了。如今的她，就连染成了玫瑰色的指甲盖都是有品位的。她出落得更加水灵了。我觉得在我见过的女性中，她的鼻子长得最直、最美。不论在前额上或者在她淡褐色的眼睛下面，都看不见一丝皱纹；她的皮肤虽然失去了几分少女时期的清新光泽，但仍如凝脂一般；也许是由于使用护肤液、乳霜，以及面部按摩的缘故，她的皮肤如今显得滋润光滑、吹弹可破，独具一种魅力。她那清秀的脸庞略施粉黛，芳唇上淡淡涂了点朱色；浅棕色的头发按照当时的风尚剪得很短，并且烫过。她的手上没有戴戒指，这使我想起艾略特说过她把首饰都卖掉了；她的手算不上特别纤巧，但十分匀称。那个时候的女子白天喜欢穿短裙，我发现她那两条穿着香槟酒色长袜的腿十分修长，特别好看。许多漂亮女子坏就坏在腿长得不够好看。记得伊莎贝尔的一双腿在当姑娘时极不入眼，而今一变为异常美观。事实上，在过去，她的魅力来自于大放异彩的健康、高扬的青春气息和亮丽的气色，昔日的那个漂亮小姑娘如今变成了一位如花似玉的美少妇。

至于她的美有几分靠的是素养、训练和修饰容貌，似乎并不重要，反正结果极其理想。也许，经过了苦心经营，她才有了这般绰约的风姿和娴雅的举止，但看上去却自然天成。我有一种感觉：她的美犹如一件艺术品，已着墨数年，而在巴黎居住的这四个月点上了最后一笔，使之脱颖而出。艾略特即便用最苛刻的眼光加以挑剔，恐怕也挑不出毛病来。我本来就不是个吹毛求疵的人，自然觉得她美压群芳。

格雷到莫特芳丹打高尔夫去了，伊莎贝尔说他不一会儿就会回来的。

“我要让你看看我的两个小女儿。她们去杜伊勒里公园了，应该马上就能回家了。她们都很可爱的。”

我们说这说那的，聊个没完。她说她喜欢巴黎的生活，说住在艾略特的公寓里十分舒适。艾略特临行之前，把他的一些这小两口很可能会喜欢的朋友介绍给了他们，现在他们有了一个很开心的朋友圈。艾略特要求他们按照他惯常的那种做法设盛宴待友。

“要知道，我们现在老摆阔，其实一贫如洗，想起来就觉得好笑。”

“真的一贫如洗吗？”

她咯咯笑了，这使我想起十年前她的那种轻松、快活、令人心情愉悦的笑声。

“格雷一个铜板也没有。我的进项很少，差不多跟拉里当年一样。那时候拉里想娶我，我不肯嫁给他，因为我觉得靠那点钱难以维持生计，殊不知我现在多了两个孩子，照样过日子。你说滑稽不滑稽？”

“很高兴你以幽默的眼光看待此事。”

“你有拉里的消息吗？”

“我吗？没有。你上次离开巴黎之前，我就再也没见过他了。他的朋友圈里，有几个我也认识，我还打听过他的情况呢。不过，那都是多年以前的事了。好像没人知道他的下落。他就这么蒸发了。”

“拉里在芝加哥的一家银行开有账户，我们认识该行的经理。经理说他时不时会从哪个怪地方开来一张付款支票——有中国的，有缅甸的，有印度的。他好像在周游世界。”

一个问题已经溜到了嘴边，我便索性说了出来。再怎么样，想了解情况，最好的办法就是开口问。

“你没嫁给他，现在后悔吗？”

她嫣然一笑说道：

“和格雷在一起，我感到十分幸福。他是个‘五好’老公。在经济大崩溃发生之前，我们的日子开心极了。我们喜欢同样的人，喜欢做同样的事情。他对我体贴入微。受到老公的宠爱，那感觉真好。至今，他都对我恩爱如初。在他的眼里，我是天下最棒的女孩子。你无法想象他是多么温柔和体贴。他对我的慷慨大度，简直到了让人觉得荒唐的地步。他认为天下没有我不配得到的东西。结婚多年来，他没有冲我说过一句刺耳或难听的话。啊，我真是太幸运了。”

我暗想她可能觉得这就算回答了我的问题了，于是便转了话题。

“给我讲讲你的两个小女儿吧。”

我话音未落，就听见了门铃响。

“她们来了。你自己看吧。”

一转眼，就有两个小姑娘走了进来，身后跟着她们的保育员。伊莎贝尔先介绍我认识大女儿琼，然后介绍小女儿普里西拉。她们依次和我握手，同时微微鞠躬致意。两姐妹一个八岁，一个六岁，跟同龄人相比个头显高。伊莎贝尔个子就高，我记得格雷也是个大块头。这俩孩子的美仅仅是普通儿童的那种美。她们看上去身子骨比较单薄，有着父亲的黑发以及母亲的浅褐色眼睛。在生人面前，她们丝毫也不害羞，争先恐后地告诉妈妈她们在花园里都做了些什么。她们的目光紧紧盯在伊莎贝尔的厨子端来的可口茶点上——那茶点我们俩谁都还没有碰过。伊莎贝尔允许她们每人挑一块吃，这倒叫二人颇费脑筋，不知挑哪一块好。显然，她们对自己的母亲怀着深深的爱，叫人看了为之感动。母女三人在一起享受天伦之乐，构成一幅美好的图画。两姐妹吃完各自挑选的蛋糕，伊莎贝尔便将她们支走了。她们一声不吭，乖乖走掉了。我所得的印象是：伊莎贝尔把她们管教得十分听话。

她们走后，我又说了几句闲话，无非就是“慈母乖儿”那一类的话。伊莎贝尔听了我的一番恭维显然很受用，但样子有些淡然。随后，我问格雷喜不喜欢巴黎。

“非常喜欢。艾略特舅舅留下一辆汽车给我们，所以他几乎每天都能够去打高尔夫球；他还加入了旅行家俱乐部，在那儿打打桥牌。说起来，艾略特舅舅让出这套公寓供我们住，真是天降洪恩。当初，格雷精神崩溃，至今仍头痛欲裂。就是能找到工作，他也干不了。为此，他把肠子都愁断了。他想工作，也觉得自己应该工作，不能干活养家会叫他无地自容。他认为一个男子汉有责任工作，否则生不如死。一想到自己成了多余的人，他便无法忍受。我好言相劝，说休息休息、换换环境可以使他恢复常态，好说歹说把他劝到了巴黎来。但我清楚，除非他能够东山再起，否则他不会真正开心的。”

“这两年半，你们的日子恐怕是十分艰难。”

“唉，想当初经济大崩溃降临时，我简直不敢相信那是真的。无法想象，我们竟会倾家荡产。要说别人破产，我还能相信，可是至于我们……唉，实在让人意想不到。我一直到最后都心存希望，认为老天会拯救我们的。后来，致命的一击落在了我们身上，我觉得没法再活下去，无法再面对未来，一时间感到天昏地暗。有两个星期的时间，我悲恸欲绝。天呀，所有的家产都离你而去，今后再无欢乐可言，你所喜欢的一切都跟你再也无缘，那种感觉真是可怕极了……两个星期过后，我痛定思痛，对自己说道：‘见它的鬼吧，我再也不去想了！’从那以后，我再也没有发过愁。没有什么可遗憾的。不管昨天多么灿烂，如今过去了，就让它过去吧。”

“显然，住在上等住宅区的一套豪华公寓里，有一个能干的管家和一个厨艺高超的厨子，自己分文不用花，还可以给自己的瘦骨头穿上沙诺尔式女装店缝制的衣服，破产的痛苦是容易忍受的，你说是不是？”

“不是沙诺尔式衣服，而是朗万[81]女装。”她咯咯一笑说，“十年没见，你可是一点都没有变。你是个愤世嫉俗的人，想必不会相信我的话的。也可能，我当初接受艾略特舅舅的邀请，全都是为了格雷和孩子。按说，有我那每年两千八百块的进项，我们一家可以在农场过得很好——种种稻子、黑麦和玉米，再养养猪。再怎么说，我也是在伊利诺伊的一个农场出生和成长大的。”

“任你怎么说吧。”我笑了笑说道。其实，我知道她是在纽约的一家价钱昂贵的产科医院出生的。

就在这时，格雷走了进来。十二年前，我只见过他两三次，这倒是真的，但他的结婚照我还是见过的（艾略特把那张结婚照镶在一个漂亮的镜框里，和瑞典国王、西班牙王后、吉斯公爵签过名的各自的照片一同放在钢琴上面）。他的模样我记得很清楚。这时一见面，我却吓了一大跳。他的鬓角秃得很厉害，头上有一小块秃顶，一张脸又红又胖，都胖成双下巴了。多年来养尊处优的生活以及饮酒过量让他的体重大大增加，只是由于个子高，才没有叫他显得过分臃肿。但最能吸引我注意力的是他的眼神。我记得很清楚，当他前途无量、无忧无虑的时候，那双爱尔兰人的蓝眼睛里充满着信任和坦率，如今在那双眼睛里似乎看到的是迷茫和惶恐。即便不了解内情，恐怕也能猜得到：一定是天降大祸，摧毁了他的自信心以及他对社会秩序的信任。我觉得他有一种自卑感，仿佛做了错事一样，虽则并非出于有意，却仍羞愧难当。显而易见，他的心理世界已经崩溃。他热情、礼貌地跟我寒暄，像是老友重逢一样满脸的高兴，但我却感到他表面的兴奋和开心只是待客的方式，与他的心里感受并不相符。

酒水送来后，他为我们每人调了杯鸡尾酒。他刚刚打完两轮高尔夫球，对自己的球技颇为满意。在谈到其中一次击球进洞的经历时，他大讲特讲自己是如何克服了重重困难，整个叙述过程冗长、啰唆，伊莎贝尔却似乎听得津津有味。又过了几分钟，我跟他们约了个日子请他们吃饭和看戏，便告辞了。

我逐渐养成一个习惯，干完一天的工作之后，下午就去看望看望伊莎贝尔，一星期要去三四趟。这个时间，她通常都一个人在家，乐得跟人聊天。艾略特给她介绍的那些人，比她的年纪要大得多，我发现她几乎没有和她年龄相仿的朋友。我自己的朋友大多忙得不可开交，不到吃晚饭是腾不出时间的。再说，我喜欢和伊莎贝尔聊天，而不愿去俱乐部跟那些气哼哼的法国人打桥牌——那些法国佬不太欢迎外人介入他们的圈子。伊莎贝尔把我当作同龄人对待，千娇百媚的，使得我们的谈话轻松愉快。我们谈笑风生、插科打诨，时而谈人生，时而谈朋友们的情况，时而谈书画，时光就这么令人愉快地悄然流逝。我生性有个缺点：总是看不惯其貌不扬的人。一个朋友，不管性格多么好，即便有多年的交情，如果掉了牙齿或歪了鼻子，我便感到不舒服了。另一方面，对于漂亮的人我却百看不厌——对于这样的人，尽管交往已有二十年之久，我仍喜欢看她们那标致的额头或者线条优美的脸颊。因此，我每次见到伊莎贝尔，看着她那完美的鹅蛋脸、凝脂般细腻的皮肤以及淡褐色眼里闪烁着的明快光芒，我都会产生一种心旷神怡的感觉。

后来，一件意想不到的事发生了。





三


在所有大城市里，有着一个个独立的社会圈子，彼此互不交往，在偌大的一个世界上构成了若干小世界，关起门过自己的日子，内部的成员相互依存、抱团取暖，犹如一座座孤岛，岛与岛之间隔着无法通航的海峡。根据我的所见所闻，没有一座城市比巴黎更是如此了。在这座城市里，上流社会很少允许外人涉足圈内；政客们自成一个圈子，过着糜烂的生活；大大小小的资产阶级相互之间你来我往；作家和作家欢聚一堂（在安德烈·纪德[82]的日记里，有一点很突出：他好像很少跟自己行业之外的人交往），画家和画家结伴，音乐家和音乐家为友。伦敦的情况也大致如此，只不过不那么明显罢了。伦敦城内，虽也“人以群分”，但与巴黎相比就不那么讲究了，有那么十几户人家，餐桌上既能看见公爵夫人，也可以遇到演员、画家、议员、律师、服装设计师和作家。

我的人生际遇使得我在不同的时间段里游走于巴黎各类社交圈子，甚至还（通过艾略特）进入过圣日尔曼大街那个封闭的世界，但我最喜欢的是以蒙帕纳司大街为中轴的那个小社会——这个小社会在我心目中的地位要超过那个以现在叫作福煦大道为中心的拘谨保守的小圈子，要超过经常光顾拉鲁埃餐馆和巴黎咖啡馆的那些国际人士，也超过蒙马特尔区的那些吵吵闹闹、蓬头垢面的追欢族。年轻时，我曾经在贝尔福狮子咖啡馆附近的一个小公寓里住过一年。我的房间在五楼，视野开阔，可以眺望到那片公墓。蒙帕纳司在我眼中仍旧具有当初它特有的那种外省乡镇的静谧气息。走过阴暗、狭窄的奥德萨街时，我会怦然心跳，会回想起我们经常聚餐的那家寒碜的餐馆。我们中间有油画家、插图画家和雕塑家，除了阿诺德·班内特[83]偶尔来来外，在座的就我一个作家了。我们在那儿一待就待到很晚，一块儿讨论绘画和文学，一个个情绪激昂，语气激愤，样子荒唐可笑。如今走在蒙帕纳司大街上，看一看那些和我当年一样的年轻人，以他们为蓝本构想几篇故事，仍不失为人生乐事。无事可做的时候，我就搭乘出租车去多姆咖啡店怀怀旧。昔日的景象不复存在，它已不再是放荡不羁的文化人聚会的场所，而成了附近小商小贩的啜饮之地，顾客中也有塞纳河对岸跑来的外乡人，他们怀着一线希望，想看看一个业已消亡的世界留下的痕迹。当然，来的人中间仍有学生、画家和作家，但多为外国人。坐在这里，既可以听到法语，也可以听到俄语、西班牙语、德语和英语。我有一种感觉，他们的话题跟我们四十年前的话题基本是一样的，只不过他们谈的是毕加索而非马奈，是安德烈·布勒东[84]而非纪尧姆·阿波利奈尔[85]。对这些人我有一种亲切的感觉。来到巴黎后，大约有两个星期的时间了。一天傍晚，我去多姆咖啡店小饮，露台上人多，只好在前排找一张桌子坐下。天气晴暖。法国梧桐树上叶子的苞芽待出，空气中飘荡着巴黎所特有的那种闲散、轻松和欢快的气氛。我的内心一片宁静——这不是呆滞的宁静，而是充满了活力的宁静。突然，一个男子从旁边走过时，却停住了脚步，咧嘴一笑，露出一口雪白的牙齿，冲着我打招呼道：“你好！”我白了他一眼。此人瘦高个，没有戴帽子，乱蓬蓬的深棕色头发早就该剪了，上嘴唇和下巴被浓密的棕色胡须遮得严严实实，额头和脖子被太阳晒成了紫红色。他穿一件破衬衫，没有打领带，一件旧旧的棕色外套，下穿一条褴褛的灰裤子。看他的模样像个叫花子，我坚信自己和此人素不相识。在我看来，他就是那种流落于巴黎街头的混混，八成会编出一套落难的故事，从我手中骗几个法郎去吃顿晚饭，找个住宿的地方。他站在我面前，双手插兜，露出雪白的牙齿，黑眼睛里含着笑意。

“你记不得我啦？”他问。

“我从来就没有见过你。”

我准备给他二十法郎把他打发走，可又觉得无法容忍他撒谎，好像我们以前认识似的。

“我是拉里。”他说。

“我的天呀！快请坐！”

他嘿嘿一笑，趋前一步，在我旁边的空椅子上坐了下来。

“来杯喝的！”我冲着跑堂的侍者喊了一声，然后又对拉里说道：“你满脸的胡子，怎么能叫我认出来呢？”

侍者走过来，拉里点了杯橘子水。我仔细打量拉里，想起了他眼睛的特别之处——那虹膜和瞳孔的颜色一样黑，让他的目光显得专注和神秘。

“你来巴黎多长时间了？”我问。

“一个月。”

“预备待下去吗？”

“待一段时间吧。”

我一边问话，脑子却转个不停。我注意到他的裤脚已毛了边，上衣的胳膊肘处有几个窟窿眼，一副落魄相，跟我在东方港口碰见过的流浪汉没什么两样。那些日子，人们对经济大萧条的后果久久难忘，于是我便觉得一定是一九二九年的经济大崩溃使他成了个穷光蛋。我不喜欢绕着圈子说话，此时干脆开门见山地问道：

“你是不是落了难？”

“哪里的话。我挺好的。你怎么会这么想？”

“哦，你看上去像是吃施舍饭的，身上破衣烂衫，还不如扔到垃圾箱里好。”

“有这么糟吗？这我从来没有想到过。其实，我计划着添几件零用品，可就是没有能付诸实施。”

我觉得他是难为情或者放不下架子，所以不愿意再听他支吾下去。

“别充好汉了，拉里。我不是百万富翁，但也不穷。如果你缺钱，就让我借给你几千法郎吧。这不会叫我破产的。”

他哈哈大笑起来。

“多谢。不过，我并不缺钱。我自己的钱都花不完呢。”

“经济大崩溃中没受冲击吗？”

“哦，那次大崩溃没有冲击到我。我把所有的钱都买了政府公债。不知道政府公债是不是也贬值了。我没有打听过，只知道山姆大叔[86]仍一如既往地支付着利息。实际上，这几年我的花销很小，手头宽裕着呢。”

“那么，你是从哪里过来的？”

“从印度。”

“哦，我听说你去了那里，是伊莎贝尔告诉我的。她好像认识你在芝加哥那家银行的经理。”

“伊莎贝尔？你是什么时候见到她的？”

“昨天。”

“她不会在巴黎吧？”

“实际上，她在巴黎呢，住在艾略特·邓普顿的那套公寓里。”

“太好了。我想见见她。”

我们说这些话时，我一直在留意观察他的眼神，发现他的眼睛里有很自然的诧异和喜悦，没有复杂的成分。

“格雷也住在那里。你知道他们结婚了吗？”

“知道。鲍勃大叔，也就是我的监护人纳尔逊医生，曾经写信告诉过我。他几年前过世了。”

我想起纳尔逊医生可能是他和芝加哥以及那边的朋友之间的唯一联系，如今这条线一断，他大概对这几年发生的事情一无所知。于是我告诉他伊莎贝尔生了两个女儿，亨利·马图林和路易莎·布雷德利离开了人世，说格雷已经破产，还讲了讲艾略特的义举。

“艾略特也在巴黎吗？”

“不在。”

四十年来，艾略特第一次不在巴黎过春天。尽管看上去显年轻，他毕竟也是七旬老者了。在这古稀之年，他经常感到周身乏力，身体欠佳。除了散步，他把别的锻炼项目都逐渐放弃了。他对自己的健康状况深感忧虑。他的医生每个星期来探视两次，在他的两边屁股上轮流打针，皮下注射一种当时流行的针剂。每次吃饭，不论在家里或者在外面，他总要从口袋里掏出个小金盒子，取出一粒药片吞下去，就像履行宗教仪式一样郑重其事。医生劝他去蒙特卡蒂尼疗养，那是意大利北部的一个温泉疗养场。这之后，他提出想到威尼斯去寻找一个圣洗池，准备安放在他的那座罗马式教堂里。他对巴黎的钟爱已大不如从前了，原因是他觉得巴黎的社交生活一年不如一年。他不喜欢年纪大的人，遇到有人请客，请的都是他这般年纪的人，他就觉得心中不快。而见了年轻人，他又觉得他们浅薄。装修他出资建造的那座教堂，如今成了他生活中主要的兴趣所在；在这上面，他大量购买艺术品，宣泄自己对艺术的那种根深蒂固的热情，同时感到心安理得，觉得是在为上帝效力。他在罗马找到一座蜜黄色石头砌的基督教早期的祭坛，又在佛罗伦萨花了六个月时间讨价还价，买了一块锡耶纳派[87]的三幅一体的浮雕图，将浮雕图镶嵌在祭坛上方。

随后，拉里问我格雷喜不喜欢巴黎。

“他在这儿恐怕有一种失落感。”

我试图向他描述格雷给我留下的印象。拉里听着，眼睛一眨不眨，死死盯着我的脸，一副若有所思的表情。不知怎么的，我觉得他不是用耳朵在听，而用的是内心深处一种更为敏感的器官。这让我觉得怪兮兮的，感到有点不太舒服。

“不过，你还是自己看看吧。”我末了说。

“好的。我很想见见他们。在电话簿上，我想是能够找到他们的住址的。”

“不过有一点：假如你不想把他们的魂都吓掉，不想吓得孩子们喊起来，劝你先去剃个头，把胡子刮刮。”

他一听笑了起来。

“我正打算这么做呢。显然没有必要使自己这么招眼。”

“除此之外，你还应该给自己弄一套新衣服。”

“我这一身也许真算得上衣衫褴褛了。临离开印度的时候，我才发现自己只有身上的这套行头了。”

拉里说到这里，看了看我穿的衣服，问我是哪家裁缝做的。我告诉了他，但又补充了一句，说这家裁缝在伦敦，可能无法为他效力。我们撇开此事不提，又聊起了格雷和伊莎贝尔来。

“他们俩我是经常见的。”我说道，“他们把日子过得十分幸福。我一直没机会跟格雷单独交谈，其实就是单独交谈，他也不会跟我谈伊莎贝尔的。不过，我知道他对伊莎贝尔的感情非常深。静下来的时候，他表情阴郁、目光茫然，而一看到伊莎贝尔，他的眼睛里便有了柔情爱意，见了令人感动。我有一种感觉，在那些风风雨雨中，伊莎贝尔始终站在他身旁，坚如磐石，此恩此情他终生难忘。见了面，你会发现伊莎贝尔变了样。”我没告诉他，伊莎贝尔现在之美是以前任何时候都无法比拟的。以前的那个漂亮的高个子女孩已经变成了一个端庄典雅、仪态万方的美少妇，这一蜕变的过程谁知道他能不能辨得出来。世间有些男人，他们只喜欢天生的丽质，而不喜欢修饰出来的美。“她对格雷很好，尽了最大的力量帮助他恢复自信心。”我继续说道。

说话间，天色渐晚，我问拉里愿不愿跟我到街上找个地方吃晚饭。

“不了，我就不去了。谢谢。”他回答说，“我得走了。”

他站起来，亲亲热热点了个头，抽身离去，出了咖啡店，走到了人行道上。





四


次日见到格雷和伊莎贝尔，我把巧遇拉里的事跟他们讲了，他们俩和我当初一样，也颇感意外。

“能见见他是件让人开心的事。”伊莎贝尔说，“这就给他打个电话吧。”

我这才想起自己忘记问他住在哪里了。为此，伊莎贝尔把我狠狠埋怨了几句。

“即便我问他，他也不一定会告诉我的。”我笑着辩白，“也许，这是我的潜意识在作怪吧。难道你忘了，他是从来都不喜欢把自己的住处告诉别人的。他怪也怪在这一点上。他随时都可能从哪个地方钻出来。”

“他就是这种人，”格雷说，“过去亦是如此，来无影去无踪，行迹难定，今天在此，明日在彼。你明明看见他在一个房间里，想着过会儿去跟他打个招呼，但一转身他就不见了。”

“他历来我行我素，十分叫人生气。”伊莎贝尔说，“这一点是谁都无法否认的。咱们只好等着了，他愿来的时候自然会来的。”

那天他没有来，第二天也没有来，第三天亦没有见到他的影子。伊莎贝尔抱怨起来，说这件事是我编出来的，纯粹想惹她生气。我信誓旦旦地说自己没有撒谎，并设想出了一些拉里没来的原因向她解释。不过，我说的这些原因都是站不住脚的。我心中暗忖，他可能经过仔细考虑，决定不来见格雷和伊莎贝尔了，于是一走了之，离开巴黎到别的地方去了。我觉得他如闲云野鹤四处游荡，只凭一时高兴、一时兴起，或者说一时心血来潮，便倏忽不见。

最后，他终于露面了。那是个雨天，格雷没有去莫特芳丹打球。我们三个人在一起——伊莎贝尔和我在喝茶，格雷端着一杯掺过毕雷矿泉水[88]的威士忌细啜慢饮。管家打开房门，拉里迈着四方步走了进来。伊莎贝尔欢叫一声像弹簧一样跳了起来，冲上去扑进他的怀里，在他的脸上左亲右亲。格雷的一张红红胖胖的脸比平时更红了，热情地拉住他的手。

“哈，看见你真让人高兴，拉里。”格雷说道，激动得声音都有些哽咽了。

伊莎贝尔咬着嘴唇，看得出她是强忍住才没有哭出声来。

“来喝杯酒，老伙计。”格雷颤抖着声音说。

小两口见到这位浪迹天涯的朋友感到由衷的高兴，这幅场景见了叫人为之动容。一想到自己在他们心中占有如此重要的位置，拉里的心情一定会非常愉快的。只见他开心地绽出了笑容。但我觉得他内心深处是相当冷静的。寒暄间，他一眼看到了桌子上的茶具。

“我想喝杯茶。”他说道。

“啧，啧，怎么能喝茶呢。”格雷嚷嚷道，“咱们喝瓶香槟酒吧。”

“我喜欢喝茶。”拉里笑吟吟地说。

他的冷静对那两口子产生了影响，而这恐怕正是他想看到的。小两口平静了下来，但他们看他的眼神里仍充满了友爱。我并不是说，拉里对别人由衷的喜悦，报以无礼的冷漠；恰恰相反，他表现得异常彬彬有礼、和蔼可亲。但在他的言谈举止中隐约可见一种只能称之为超然的东西，至于那东西有着什么深层的含义我却一无所知。

“你真坏，为什么不早点儿来看望我们？”伊莎贝尔佯怒嗔怪道，“这五天里，我天天都倚在窗口盼你来呢。每次门铃响，我的心都要跳到嗓子眼里了，要费很大的劲才能把它重新咽下去。”

拉里嘿嘿嘿一阵傻笑。

“毛姆先生说我的样子太可怕，像个野蛮人，你们的管家不会叫我进门的。所以，我飞到伦敦购置新装了。”

“你用不着跑那么老远，”我笑笑说，“在春天百货公司或百丽服饰店就可以买到现成的衣服。”

“我觉得既然要购置衣服，就最好弄有格调的。再说，我已经有十年没有在欧洲买衣服了。于是我就去找你的那个裁缝，说我想做套衣服，三天内取货。他说得用两个星期，后来折中定为四天。这不，一小时前，我刚从伦敦飞了回来。”

他穿着一套蓝色哔叽西服，对他瘦削的身材来说极为合体，内穿一件软领白衬衣，系一条蓝色丝绸领带，脚蹬一双棕色的鞋子。他剪了个短发，刮光了脸上的胡子，不仅看上去干净整洁，而且很入时，与以前相比判若两人。由于太瘦，颧骨突出，太阳穴凹陷，深藏在眼窝里的那双眸子比我记忆中的那双更显得大了。尽管如此，他的相貌仍是那般英俊潇洒、风流倜傥，一张晒黑了的、没有皱纹的脸让他显得异常年轻。他和格雷同为三十出头的人（他比格雷只小一岁），但格雷看上去要老十岁，而他则要年轻十岁。由于是个大块头，格雷动作迟缓、笨拙，拉里的一举一动却轻盈、敏捷。拉里像个小男孩一般，欢快和活泼，而我深切感觉到他的内心一片宁静——他已经不再是从前我认识的那个小青年了。谈话在轻松的气氛中进行着，这在老朋友之间是很自然的，因为他们有着许多共同的记忆。格雷和伊莎贝尔不时加几条芝加哥新闻进去，都是些零星花絮，一件连着一件，引得笑声朗朗。我一直有一个印象，就是拉里虽则笑得很爽朗，听伊莎贝尔滔滔不绝讲话时显得很高兴，他的内心却异常落寞。我觉得他并不是假装高兴；他生性纯真，不会弄虚作假；他的高兴显然是真诚的。但我感到在他的内心世界里有一样东西，不知该称之为知性、感性，抑或力量，使得他莫名其妙地有点落落寡合。

两个小姑娘被领了进来，和拉里见过，彬彬有礼地冲着拉里行了个屈膝礼。拉里伸出手来，柔和的眼睛里含着慈祥和仁爱望着她们。小姑娘们握了他的手，两双眼睛天真地看着他。伊莎贝尔喜滋滋地告诉拉里，说她们的功课都很不错，随后给了她们每人一块甜点心，把她们支走了。

“你们睡觉时，我去给你们念十分钟的书。”

此时此刻，伊莎贝尔沉浸在与拉里重逢的喜悦中，不愿意受到打搅。小姑娘们走上前跟她们的父亲道晚安。那个大块头汉子把她们搂在怀里吻了吻，红脸上涌起浓浓的爱意，见了让人感动。谁都看得出他爱她们，为她们感到自豪。女儿走后，他唇边浮起甜蜜的微笑，对拉里说道：

“这俩孩子不错吧，是不是？”

伊莎贝尔深情地望了他一眼。

“要是由着格雷胡来，他会把她们惯坏的。这个大坏蛋，他会把我饿死，也要买来鱼子酱和鹅肝[89]给孩子吃，让她们吃得发撑。”

格雷笑着瞧了瞧她说：“这你就说得不对了，你心里最清楚。我爱你爱得要发疯。”

伊莎贝尔的眼里涌出了会心的笑意。她对格雷的爱心知肚明，并为此感到高兴。多么幸福的一对夫妻！

她提出要留我们吃晚饭，我觉得他们也许愿意和拉里单独说说话，便推说有事，而她坚决不听我解释，说道：

“我去告诉玛丽在汤里多放一根胡萝卜，就够四个人吃的了。还有只鸡，你和格雷可以吃腿，我和拉里吃翅膀。她还会做奶蛋酥的，足够大家享用。”

格雷似乎也想让我留下。我本来就不想走，于是便来了个恭敬不如从命。

等待吃饭的当儿，伊莎贝尔把他们的遭遇从头到尾讲了一遍（他们的情况我曾经给拉里简单介绍过）。那段悲惨的往事她讲起来虽然语调尽可能轻松，但格雷的脸上却布上了一层阴云。她见了，想使格雷高兴起来，便说道：

“现在，一切都过去了。我们栽过跟头，但前途是光明的。到了峰回路转的时候，格雷就找个好工作，挣他个几百万块。”

鸡尾酒送了进来。两杯酒下肚，可怜的格雷情绪有所好转。我看见拉里虽然拿了一杯酒，却碰也没碰。格雷没有注意到这个，要再敬他一杯，被他婉拒了。然后，大家洗了手，坐下来吃晚饭。格雷要来一瓶香槟酒，可是管家给拉里倒酒时，他却说自己不想喝。

“嗨，你必须喝一点。”伊莎贝尔嚷嚷道，“这是艾略特舅舅最好的酒，只用来招待特殊的贵客。”

“实话说，我喜欢喝水。在东方待久了，觉得喝干净水是最好的。”

“今天这是特殊场合嘛。”

“好吧。那我就喝一杯吧。”

饭菜香喷喷的。但我和伊莎贝尔都注意到拉里吃得很少。伊莎贝尔也许觉得她只顾自己说话，拉里只有听的份儿，无机会插话，于是便问他在这十年未见的时间里都干了些什么。拉里回答时语气坦率、真诚，但含糊其词，等于没有告诉我们多少情况。

“哦，瞎转悠呗。在德国待了一年，又到西班牙和意大利待了些时间。后来又去东方游荡了一阵子。”

“你这是刚从哪里来的？”

“从印度。”

“你在印度待了多久？”

“五年。”

“玩得痛快吗？”格雷问，“去打老虎了吗？”

“没有。”拉里笑了笑说。

“你在印度一待就是五年，都做些什么呢？”伊莎贝尔问。

“四处游玩。”拉里回答说，脸上露出一丝玩世不恭的微笑。

“‘绳子魔术’[90]是怎么回事？”格雷问，“你见他们表演过吗？”

“没有，没见过。”

“那你都见到过什么呢？”

“那就多了。”

此时，我向拉里提了一个问题：

“瑜伽修行者是不是真的具有人们所说的超自然的能力？”

“说不上来。我只能告诉你，在印度，人们都普遍这么认为。不过，智者并不看重这种能力，认为它会妨碍修真。记得一位智者给我讲过一个故事，说的是一个瑜伽师来到河边，苦于身上没钱，摆渡的船夫拒绝让他上船，于是瑜伽师踏水而去，如履平地，径直抵达对岸。讲到这里，智者鄙夷地耸了耸肩说：‘这样的雕虫小技不值钱，只顶得上乘渡船用的一个铜板。’”

“你觉得瑜伽师真的能踏水如履平地吗？”格雷问道。

“那位智者是这么说的，显然他相信是真的。”

听拉里说话是一种享受，因为他声音纯美如天籁之音，圆润、轻快，而不低沉，抑扬顿挫恰到好处。饭后，大家回到客厅里喝咖啡。我没去过印度，急切想了解更多的情况。

“你跟作家和思想家有过接触吗？”我问。

“我发现你把作家和思想家分成了两个群体。”伊莎贝尔取笑我说。

“当然要跟他们接触了。”拉里回答道。

“你是怎么和他们交流的？用英语吗？”

“有意思的是，他们即便会说英语，也说得不大好，理解上就更差了。我学了印度斯坦语，后来去南方，又学了泰米尔语，反正足够交流用的了。”

“你现在懂多少种语言呀，拉里？”

“哦，说不准，也就是六七种吧。”

“我还想多了解一点瑜伽师的情况。”伊莎贝尔说，“你和他们有没有关系很熟的？”

“和几位终年苦修的瑜伽师倒是非常熟。”拉里笑了笑说，“我曾在一个苦修林住过两年。”

“两年？苦修林是个什么样的地方？”

“这个嘛，你也可以把它叫作隐居地吧。有些圣人喜欢过独居生活，或在庙里，或在林中，或在喜马拉雅山山麓。还有一些圣人广招门徒。一些乐善好施的人为了积累功德，常常为自己崇拜的瑜伽圣人建造房屋，有大的也有小的，门徒们也随着自己的恩师一块居住，住在晾台上、厨房里（如果有厨房的话），或者栖身于树下。我在这样的苦修林中有一个斗室，刚能放得下我的行军床、桌椅和书架。”

“这地方在哪儿？”我问。

“在特拉凡哥尔。那儿风景如画，青山翠谷，细水蜿蜒流淌。山中有老虎、豹子、大象和野牛，而苦修林位于环礁湖畔，周围椰子树和槟榔树郁郁葱葱。它距离最邻近的城镇也有三四英里远，但人们从镇上或更远的地方纷至沓来，有的步行，有的坐牛车，来听瑜伽圣人宣讲（如果他有兴致的话），或者仅仅坐在圣人的脚下，享受圣人所带来的那一份静谧和吉祥——那份静谧和吉祥犹如花香弥漫在空气中。”

格雷在椅子上不安地扭动着身子。我猜想可能是因为谈话转了弯，让他感到不耐烦了。

“来杯酒吗？”他问我。

“不喝。谢谢。”

“哦，我可要喝一杯了。你喝不喝，伊莎贝尔？”

他把巨大、沉重的身躯从椅子上抬起来，向吧台走去，那儿放着威士忌、毕雷矿泉水以及玻璃杯。

“那地方还有别的白人吗？”

“没有了。只有我一个白人。”

“两年的时间，你怎么能熬得下来？”

“一眨眼就过去了。以前过日子，就是几天好像也要比这两年漫长得多呢。”

“那么长的时间，你都干些什么呀？”

“看书、长距离散步、湖上荡舟，以及冥思。冥思十分耗费精力，两三个小时就会叫你精疲力竭，仿佛开车一口气跑了五百英里的路一样，只想好好休息一下。”

伊莎贝尔微微皱了皱眉头。她心里一片迷茫，恐怕也有点害怕。她可能有一种想法，这个几小时前走进屋来的拉里，虽然表面上没有变化，好像仍和从前一样开朗和友爱，但和她过去认识的那个拉里，那个非常坦率、平易、欢快、任性不听话但讨人喜欢的拉里已经不是一个人了。她曾经失去了他，如今重逢，起先以为他还是昔日的拉里，尽管历尽沧桑，却依旧属于她。然而现在，她好像抓了一把阳光在手里，那阳光从指头缝里溜掉了。这让她有点沮丧。那天晚上，我一直在盯着她瞧（这在我历来都是赏心悦目的事）。我发现她眼里充满着喜悦在看拉里那修剪得很整齐的脑袋（两只小耳朵紧贴着那脑袋壳），当她的目光落在拉里凹陷的太阳穴和消瘦的脸颊上时，眼神由喜转忧。她又望望他那瘦长的手——那双手虽然很瘦，却强壮有力。后来，她的目光移向了他那富于表情的嘴——那张嘴的嘴形好看，丰满但不性感，接着又去看他那平展的额头和端正的鼻子。他穿一身新装，虽没有艾略特的那种整洁、风雅，却落拓不羁、潇洒自如，好像那是一身天天穿的日常衣服似的。我觉得他似乎激起了伊莎贝尔的一种舐犊之情，而这种感情在她和自己的女儿之间并不曾见。她已有了当母亲的经历，而他看上去还像个孩子。她的神情中有一种母性的骄傲，一种为长大成人的儿子而产生的骄傲——那儿子说话有条有理，引得大家侧耳倾听，仿佛他在讲述真理。我觉得她并没有真正理解他话中的含意。

至此，我的话仍未问完。

“你的瑜伽师是个什么样子？”

“你指的是外表吧？这个嘛，个子不高，不胖也不瘦，浅棕色皮肤，脸刮得光光的，一头白发剪得很短，身上除掉一块围腰布外，什么也不穿，但看上去就和布克兄弟男装公司[91]广告牌上的那个年轻男子一样干净利落，一样穿着得体。”

“他究竟有什么特殊之处如此吸引你呢？”

拉里凝神看着我整整有一分钟，最后才做出了回答。他那双深陷在眼窝里的眼睛目光炯炯，好像要射入我的灵魂深处一样。

“圣徒气息。”

他的回答使我感到有点意外。在这个陈设着精美家具、墙上挂着名画的房间里，这句话就像浴缸里溢出的水从天花板上漏下来，啪嗒一声落在了地面上。

“咱们都读过圣徒传，其中有圣佛兰西斯[92]，有十字架的圣约翰[93]，但那都是几百年前的事了。我从未想到过能遇见一个仍活在世上的圣徒。我第一次见到他，就坚定不移地相信他是个圣徒。那是一段美妙的人生经历。”

“你的收获是什么呢？”

“宁静。”他脱口而出，脸上淡淡一笑。随后，他突然站起身说：“我得走了。”

“噢，不要走，拉里。”伊莎贝尔叫了起来，“时间还早呢。”

“晚安。”他说道，脸上仍挂着微笑，丝毫没有理会伊莎贝尔的央求。他在伊莎贝尔的面颊上亲了亲，对她说道：“过一两天我再来看你们。”

“你住在哪里？我给你打电话。”

“哦，劝你别找这个麻烦了。你也知道在巴黎打个电话有多难。再说，我们那儿的电话常常出毛病。”

拉里不愿说出住址，利落地摆脱了窘境，我见了心里不由发笑。隐瞒住址成了他的一个古怪的特征。我提出要请大家后天晚上去布伦园林[94]吃饭。在这样四处飘香的春天，露天坐在大树下面吃饭，确是一大享受。到时候，可以坐上格雷开的汽车一同前往。我跟拉里一同出了门，本想陪他走一段路，可一到街上他就跟我握了握手，快步走掉了。他走后，我坐上了一辆出租车。





五


我们约好在公寓里碰头，先喝杯鸡尾酒，然后出发。我先于拉里一步抵达公寓。我约他们去的是一家很讲究的餐馆，出入那儿的女子一般都穿得光彩照人，所以我觉得伊莎贝尔也一定会盛装打扮。我坚信不疑：她一定不愿输给别的女人。可谁知却见她穿着一件朴素的羊毛长衫。

“格雷的头痛病又发作了。”她说，“他痛苦得不行，我不能丢下他不管。我叮咛了厨娘，让她伺候孩子们吃完饭就可以走了。我必须亲自下厨，给格雷做点饭让他吃下去。你和拉里最好自己去吧。”

“格雷在床上躺着吗？”

“没有。头痛的时候，他从来都不肯躺到床上的。谁都知道病了就应该卧床，可他硬是不肯嘛。他正在书房里呢。”

这是个小房间，镶着棕色和金黄色壁板——壁板是艾略特从一座古堡里弄来的。书籍都放在镀金的格子柜里，上了锁，防止外人翻阅，也许这样做倒好，因为这些书大部分是十八世纪的有插图的淫秽书籍，不过，用摩洛哥皮面装订起来，看上去倒十分正经。伊莎贝尔领我进去时，格雷正弓着身子坐在一张大皮椅子上，脚下乱扔着一些画报。他闭着眼睛，往日的那张红脸呈现出死灰色，显然痛苦万分。他打算站起来，但我拦住了他。

“你给他吃阿司匹林了没有？”我问伊莎贝尔。

“阿司匹林一点用都不顶。我有个美国药方，但是，吃了也不见效。”

“唉，别管我了，亲爱的。”格雷说，“明天我就会好的。”他勉强一笑。“很对不起，成了你们的累赘。”末了，他冲我说道：“你们都走吧，去布伦园林吧。”

“那怎么可能呢。”伊莎贝尔说，“你痛苦得死去活来，你想我能玩得开心吗？”

“可怜的小妇人，看来她是赖上我了。”格雷说完，合上了眼睛。

接着，他的脸突然抽搐起来，看得出他的脑袋里痛如刀割。这时，房门被轻轻推开了，拉里走了进来。伊莎贝尔把情形告诉了他。

“真糟糕。”拉里同情地看了一眼格雷说，“有什么办法能解除他的病痛吗？”

“什么办法都没有。”格雷仍闭着眼睛说道，“只有一个办法，那就是让我一个人待着。你们都走吧，去玩你们的吧。”

我觉得唯有如此才是合乎理性的，却又怕伊莎贝尔心里过意不去不会同意。

“让我来看看能不能帮你一把，好不好？”拉里问。

“谁也帮不了我。”格雷有气无力地说，“头痛起来真能要我的命。有时候希望还不如一死了之。”

“要说我帮你，表达上不准确。我的意思是可以协助你自救。”

格雷慢慢睁开了眼睛，看了看拉里。

“怎么个协助法？”

拉里从口袋里取出一样东西，看上去像枚银币，把它放进了格雷的手心。

“把这硬币握紧，手背朝上。我叫你怎么做你就怎么做。不要用太大的劲，只要把它攥在手心即可。不等我数到二十，你的手就会张开，银币便会落到地上。”

格雷按他的吩咐做了。拉里坐到写字台前，开始数数。我和伊莎贝尔站在一旁观看。一，二，三，四……数到十五时，格雷的手一动不动，后来好像抖了一下。不能说我看见，而只能说有个印象——他那紧攥着的手指慢慢在松开。最先离开拳头的是大拇指。我清清楚楚看见他的手指在颤动。当拉里数到十九时，银币从格雷的手里掉下来，滚到了我的脚边。我拾起来，发现它沉甸甸的，呈不规则形状，银币的一面有一个年轻人的浮雕像，我认出那是亚历山大大帝[95]。格雷望着自己的手，一脸的困惑。

“不是我有意让银币掉落的，”格雷说，“是它自己落下去的。”

他坐在皮椅子里，右臂架在椅子扶手上。

“你坐在这椅子上舒服吗？”拉里问。

“头痛欲裂的时候，只有坐在这儿才感到舒服一点。”

“好，让你自己彻底放松。不要紧张，不要慌，什么都不要做，一切顺其自然。不等我数到二十，你的右胳膊将会从椅子的扶手上抬起，直至你的手举过头顶。一，二，三，四……”

他慢慢数着数，声音优美，如银铃一般。他数到九的时候，我看见格雷的手几乎难以察觉地动了动，从皮面的扶手上抬起了大约有一英寸，然后稍微停顿了一下。

“十，十一，十二……”

起先，手震动了一下，接着是整个胳臂开始向上移动，不再架在椅子扶手上了。伊莎贝尔有点惊恐，抓住了我的手。当时的情形真是奇怪，那胳膊像是在不由自主地移动。我从来没有见过谁梦游过，但可以想象梦游的人走动起来就像格雷的手臂移动一样古怪，看上去不像是靠意志驱动的。我觉得，要是靠意志的力量，是很难把胳膊抬得那么缓慢、那么平稳。这给人的印象是：一种不受大脑控制的潜意识力量在将他的胳膊抬起，动作就像活塞在汽缸里一上一下的，非常缓慢。

“十五，十六，十七……”

那一个个的数字说出来，简直慢极了，就像是盥洗室里的一个没关严的水龙头在滴水，一个水珠一个水珠慢慢地朝下落。格雷的胳臂一点点向上抬，直至把手举过头顶。当拉里说完最后一个数字时，他的胳臂自动落回到了椅子扶手上。

“不是我要抬胳膊的，”格雷说，“是它自己抬起来的，我就是想停也停不下来的。”

拉里淡淡地一笑。

“怎么样都不当紧，主要是想让你对我产生信心。那块希腊硬币呢？”

我把硬币递给了他。

“你把硬币攥在手里。”格雷把硬币接了过去。拉里看着表又说道：“现在是八点十三分。用不了一分钟，你的眼皮就会发沉，那时你会闭上眼，然后入睡。睡上六分钟，到了八点二十，你就会醒来。醒来后，你就不再感到头痛了。”

我和伊莎贝尔都没有说话，眼睛盯着拉里看。拉里不再言语，目光注视着格雷——那目光虽落在格雷身上，却好像不是在看他，而是穿越他的躯体瞟向他方。屋里一片沉寂，出奇的静，就像夜间花园里那般鸦雀无声。突然，我觉得伊莎贝尔抓着我的那只手猛地一紧。我望望格雷，只见他双眼紧闭，呼吸通畅、均匀，已酣然入睡。大家都站在那儿，那段时间似乎永无止境似的。我的烟瘾犯了，却又不敢点烟。拉里一动不动，目光飘向远方不知道哪个地方，木木地睁着眼，仿佛处于恍惚状态。蓦然，他好像松弛了下来，眼睛里的神情恢复了正常。他看了看表。而就在他看表之际，格雷睁开了眼睛。

“哎呀！”他说道，“我肯定是睡着了。”接着，他发了发愣。我注意到他那惨白的脸色不见了。“我的头不痛了。”

“很好。”拉里说，“抽根烟，然后咱们一起出去吃晚饭。”

“这简直是个奇迹。我觉得舒服极了。你这是怎么弄的？”

“不是我弄出来的。奇迹是你自己创造的。”

伊莎贝尔去换衣服。趁此机会，我和格雷喝了杯鸡尾酒。拉里明显不愿再提刚才的事，格雷却不肯罢休，仍在滔滔不绝地讲着。他怎么也弄不明白那一切是怎么发生的。

“起初我并不相信你会有什么办法。”他说道，“我听从你的吩咐，只是因为我懒得跟你斗嘴。”

接下来，他把自己的病情形容了一番，说他头痛如山倒，病去如抽丝，发作之后身体处于崩溃边缘。而这一次，醒来后精力充沛如初，这叫他简直弄不清是怎么回事。伊莎贝尔换衣归来，但见她穿一件我从未见过的拖地长裙，白颜色的，可能是用一种叫罗马坎平绉的布料做的，外镶一圈黑纱边。我不由心想，她打扮得如此漂亮，全是为了叫我们看了高兴。

到了马德里城堡，那儿是一片欢乐的海洋，大家玩得兴高采烈。拉里谈笑风生、趣话连篇（我以前从未见他这么风趣过），引得大伙儿哈哈大笑。我有一种感觉，他这样做是为了转移我们的注意力，免得再询问他那超凡的能力。不过，伊莎贝尔可是个意志坚强的女子。她可以做些顺水行舟的事，但最终好奇心得不到满足的她是不会罢休的。吃过饭后，大家喝咖啡和品酒。这时，伊莎贝尔可能觉得美味佳肴、香醪美酿以及友好的交谈削弱了拉里的防线，于是就将一双明眸盯住拉里，说道：

“给我们讲一讲你是怎么把格雷的头痛病治好的。”

“那个过程你们自己都看见了么。”拉里笑笑说。

“这种妙手回春的本事是在印度学的吧？”

“是的。”

“这病叫他受尽了洋罪。你能不能把他彻底治好？”

“不知道。也许可以吧。”

“这会彻底改变他的生活。他的头痛症一发作，两天两夜都没有行为能力，就是有工作也干不好的。而不干工作，他是绝不会开心的。”

“要知道，我是无法创造奇迹的。”

“可你已经创造了，我可是亲眼所见的。”

“不，那不是奇迹。我只是向他灌输了一种想法，其余的都是他自己完成的。”拉里说到此处，转过头问格雷：“明天你干什么？”

“打高尔夫。”

“我明天六点到你们府上，咱们坐下来谈谈。”拉里说完，冲着伊莎贝尔莞尔一笑，问道：“伊莎贝尔，十年没和你跳舞了，愿不愿看看我是否还能舞起来？”





六


此后，我们和拉里经常见面。在接下来的一个星期里，他天天来公寓找格雷，到书房里把门关上，二人一待就是半个小时。看上去，他在劝说格雷“悬崖勒马”（这是他开玩笑说的），走出沮丧的阴影，而格雷像个乖孩子一样百依百顺。从格雷所说的只言片语中我听得出来，拉里在试图帮助他恢复已经失去的自信心。大约在十天以后，格雷的头痛又发作了，那天碰巧拉里要到傍晚才来。这次的病来势汹汹，而格雷笃信拉里的神力，认为只要把拉里找来，就可以手到病除。可是，他们不知道他的住址，伊莎贝尔打电话问我，我也不知道。最后，拉里终于来了，解除了格雷的病痛。格雷问他住在哪里，以便紧急时可以立刻找到他。他只是笑了笑。

“你打电话给美国运通公司，留下口信就行了。我每天上午都会和他们通话的。”

伊莎贝尔后来问我拉里为什么对自己的住址讳莫如深。她说他以前也是遮遮掩掩的，结果发现他住在拉丁区的一家三流旅馆里，没什么神秘的。

“我不太清楚。”我回答说，“也可能是故作玄虚吧，其实并没有什么大不了的。也许他的精神世界需要隐私，于是产生一种古怪的心理，使得他不愿暴露自己的住址。”

“老天，你这都是在说些什么呀？”她有点急躁地说。

“他和咱们大家在一起的时候，显得平易近人、热情友好，但你会觉得他有些超然，仿佛不愿把自己完全暴露出来，而是将某样东西隐藏在了他灵魂深处的一间密室里。这种现象你难道没注意到吗？究竟是什么使他和咱们拉开了距离就不得而知了，不知是紧张的情绪、某种秘密、一种希冀，抑或是对知识的追求在其中产生了影响。”

“我从小就认识拉里，对他是知根知底的。”伊莎贝尔耐不住性子说道。

“有时候，我觉得他就像个优秀的演员，在一出难登大雅的戏里把角色演得无懈可击，就像《女店主》里的爱琳诺拉·杜丝[96]那样。”

伊莎贝尔沉吟片刻，然后说道：

“你的意思我想我是知道的。有的时候大家在一起玩得很开心，他跟所有的人一样乐悠悠的。可是，突然你会有一种感觉，觉得他好像变成了一缕青烟飘然而去，你想抓都抓不住。你说是什么原因叫他变得如此古怪呢？”

“也许原因平常得不能再平常了，让人都注意不到。”

“比如说呢？”

“比如说天性善良吧。”

伊莎贝尔听了蛾眉紧蹙。

“希望你别说这种话，让人心里边挺不是滋味的。”

“是不是戳得你心窝疼啦？”

伊莎贝尔狠狠地看了我一眼，好像这一眼要把我的心看穿一样。随后，她从身旁的桌子上取过一根烟点着，抽了口，将身子向后一靠，望着自己吐出的烟袅袅升到空中。

“你要我走吗？”我问。

“不。”

我半天没说话，只顾盯着她看，欣赏着她那漂亮的鼻子和精致的下巴。

“你是不是非常爱拉里？”我末了问道。

“看你问的，我这一辈子从来都没有爱过别人。”

“那你为什么嫁给了格雷？”

“男大当婚女大当嫁嘛。格雷爱我爱得发疯，妈妈也想让我嫁给他。那时，人人都说我和拉里分手是明智之举。我喜欢格雷，至今仍不改初衷。你都不知道他有多好。天下谁都不会对我那么温柔，那么体贴。他看上去好像脾气不好，是不是？他对我却总是那么柔情似水。有钱的时候，他为我一掷千金，恨不得把天上的月亮也摘给我。一次，我说要有艘游艇就好了，可以乘游艇周游世界。要不是碰上经济大崩溃，他一定会把游艇给我买来的。”

“你把他说得也太好啦。”我低声咕哝了一句。

“我们曾经有过一段美满的岁月。我一直对他心存感激，是他让我生活得十分幸福。”

我看了看她，却没有说话。

“也许，我对他的感情并非真爱，但没有爱情的生活也是可以过得很好的。在内心深处，我渴望得到的是拉里，不过，既然不得相见，我也觉得没有什么。你曾经说过，情人远隔重洋，中间有三千英里的距离，爱情的痛苦是完全可以忍受的。这话你还记得吗？我当时觉得是无稽之谈，现在则认为这话说得很对。”

“如果见到拉里感到痛苦，比较明智的办法是不是不见他呢？”

“痛苦是痛苦，但这是幸福的痛苦。再说，你也知道他是怎么一个人。哪天太阳落山的时候，他可能会像一道影子消失得无影无踪，多年间再也见不到他。”

“你考虑过和格雷离婚没有？”

“我没有理由和他离婚。”

“你们国家的女子一旦有了离婚的念头，任什么都是阻挡不住的。”

她哈哈笑了。

“依你看，她们为什么要离婚呢？”

“你不知道吗？美国女人要求自己的丈夫十全十美，就跟英国女人要求自己的管家完美无瑕一样。”

伊莎贝尔听了，骄傲地把头向后一甩，我真怕她会把脖子都甩断呢。

“就因为格雷不善于表达感情，你就认为他一无可取之处了。”

“你弄错了。”我急忙打断她的话说，“我觉得他身上有一种叫人感动的东西，能够清楚地表达自己的爱。他看你的时候，谁只要瞧瞧他脸上的表情，就知道他对你的爱有多么深、多么真挚了。他爱孩子比你爱得要强烈得多。”

“恐怕接下来你会说我是个坏母亲喽。”

“恰恰相反，我觉得你是个非常出色的母亲。在你的照料下，她们健康和幸福。你关照她们吃得好、大便正常，教导她们懂得礼仪，要求她们做祈祷，她们生病时为她们及时求医，并精心伺候。只不过，你不像格雷那样有十分心思就把十分心思放在她们身上。”

“没有必要那样做。我是个人，应该以人之道对待她们。为人之母，假如把子女作为自己生活的唯一目标，只会对子女有害。”

“你说的一点不错。”

“事实胜于雄辩——她们崇拜我。”

“这些我也留意到了。你是她们理想中的形象：典雅、美丽、高贵。但是，她们和你在一起不像和格雷在一起时那样适意和随便。她们崇拜你，这是事实，但她们爱格雷。”

“格雷是值得爱的。”

我很喜欢她说话直言不讳。她有个最可爱的优点，那就是直面事实，不愠不怒。

“经济大崩溃之后，格雷一蹶不振。有好多个星期，他在办公室里一直工作到深夜。坐在家里，我吓得胆战心惊，生怕他会寻短见，因为他觉得自己已无地自容。你知道，那些人过去对公司、对他父亲、对格雷都引以为自豪，相信他们正直的人格和准确的判断力。灾难之后，我们倾家荡产这还不算，最叫他过意不去的是，那些对他百般信赖的人们也把投进去的钱损失了个精光。他觉得自己早就应当看出一点苗头。我怎么劝也劝不过来，他老觉得都怪他眼拙。”

伊莎贝尔从化妆袋里取出一支口红，涂了涂嘴唇。

“不过，我想说的并不是这些。当时，我们一无所有，只剩下那片农场。我觉得格雷唯有走出是非之地才是出路。于是，把孩子交给妈妈照料，我们俩去了农场。他一直都很喜欢农场，但我们俩从未单独去过，每次去都拖家带口，在一起大家玩得很开心。格雷的枪法好，可是却没有心思打猎。他常常划一条小船，独自一人到沼泽那儿去，一待就是几个小时，在那儿观察野鸟。他划着船在运河上游荡，两边是郁郁葱葱的灯芯草，头顶上只看见一片蓝天。有些日子，运河里的水跟地中海的海水一样湛蓝湛蓝。他回家后，话却很少，只说风景很美。不过，不用他说我也能看出他心里的感受。我知道他的一颗心被那儿的美丽、辽阔和宁静震撼了。太阳落山之前，有短短的一会儿，沼泽地上洒满夕阳的余晖，美不胜收。他常常站在那儿眺望，心里充满了喜悦。他时常骑马到那些荒凉、神秘的林子里跑得老远。那些树林就像梅特林克一出戏剧里的树林一样，灰暗、沉寂，简直有点叫人毛骨悚然。春天里有一段时间（顶多只有半个月），山茱萸鲜花盛开，橡胶树长出了新叶，鲜嫩鲜嫩的绿叶和灰色的西班牙苔藓相映成趣，奏响了一曲欢乐之歌；地上开遍百合花，又大又白，野生的杜鹃花也争奇斗艳。格雷形容不出内心的感受，但他所受到的影响却是深远的。大自然的美丽让他陶然若醉。啊，真不知怎么才能表达那份心境。我只能告诉你，看见那么大一条汉子竟然有那么纯洁和美好的感情，那么如痴如醉，不能不叫人感动，感动得我差点没哭出声。如果天界有上帝的话，格雷已和他近在咫尺。”

伊莎贝尔追溯往事时，情绪有点激动，掏出一块小手绢，小心地把眼角两边晶莹的泪花揩掉。

“你未免太浪漫了吧？”我笑着说，“我有一种感觉，你是希望格雷有那种思想和感情，于是就把它们硬套在了他的头上。”

“如果他没有那种情感，难道我能瞎编吗？我是什么样的人你该知道。除非走在混凝土人行道上，沿街浏览商店的大橱窗，欣赏橱窗里的帽子、皮大衣、钻石手镯和镶金的化妆盒，否则我就不会真正地感到幸福。”

我笑了。有那么一会儿，双方都没有开口。后来，她回到了我们先前谈的话题上。

“我决不会和格雷离婚的。我们风风雨雨经历得太多了。他是绝对离不开我的。要知道，这叫人感到自己很伟大，于是就有了一份责任心。再说……”

“再说什么？”

她斜睨了我一眼，眼睛里闪出一种调皮的神情。我觉得她很可能想说什么，却吃不准我会怎么看待她。

“他床上的功夫很棒。我们结婚已有十载，而他仍热情似火，跟新婚之夜一般。你在你的一个剧本里不是说过，一个男子爱一个女子，时间不会超过五年么？哦，你这话未免有些武断。格雷爱我，一如初婚一般。在这方面，他使我很快乐。你光看我的样子，不会想到我有这要求。其实，我是个肉欲很强的女人。”

“这你就大错特错了。看看你，我会这么想的。”

“哦，这不是什么坏德行吧？”

“恰恰相反。”我说着，仔细看了她一眼，“十年前你没有嫁给拉里，现在后悔吗？”

“不后悔。那时嫁给他，才是发疯呢。不过，当然喽，假如那时我和现在一样了解风情，那我会跟他远走高飞，和他姘居三个月，然后就离开他，和他永绝情缘。”

“恐怕值得庆幸的是你没有做那样的实验。否则，你也许会发现你和他绑在了一起，连接你们的链条你想斩也斩不断。”

“此话我不能苟同。这只不过是肉体上的吸引力罢了。要知道，克服肉欲的最好办法往往就是让它得到满足。”

“你是个占有欲很强的人，这你想过没有？你告诉过我，说格雷的感情极具诗意，还说他对你激情似火，我完全相信这两点对你有着重大意义。但你没有说过，把他攥在你那美丽但并不太小的手心里，那种感觉比这两点加在一起还要重要得多。而拉里是永远也抓不住的。记得济慈的《希腊古瓮颂》里的一句诗吗？‘大胆的情人，你永远，永远得不到一吻，虽然已接近目标。’”

“你老是以为自己懂得很多，其实远非如此。”她语气有点尖刻地说，“掌控男人，女人有自己的绝招，这你也知道。让我再告诉你一点吧——控制一个男人，决定性因素不在于第一次跟他上床，而在于第二次。一旦将他抓在手里，便可一劳永逸。”

“你掌握的情况真是非同一般哟。”

“我靠的是交游广，眼观六路，耳听八方。”

“能否告诉我，你这一锦囊妙计是从何处学来的？”

她冲我笑了笑，笑容里含着嘲讽。

“在一次服装展览会上，我交了个女友，就是从她那儿学来的。女店员告诉我，说她是巴黎最出名的被人包养的女人。我当时就下定决心要和她结识。她叫阿迪安妮·德·特洛耶。听说过没有？”

“没听说过。”

“你可真是疏于学业呀！她四十五岁，虽无花容月貌，但论风度却远远胜过艾略特舅舅的那些公爵夫人。我一屁股坐到她身旁，拿出我的那种美国小女孩的任性劲，说我必须跟她说几句话，因为我有生以来从未见过她这样典雅的人，简直就像是希腊浮雕画里的女神一样完美无瑕。”

“你的胆子真够大的。”

“起初，她非常冷淡，而我滔滔不绝说个没完，一副天真无邪的样子，最后说得她软了下来。接下来，我俩推心置腹聊了一通。展览会结束时，我提出想请她哪一天去里兹饭店共进午餐。我告诉她，说我一直都很羡慕她那绰约的风姿。”

“你以前见过她？”

“没见过。她不肯去赴宴，说巴黎人喜欢造谣生事、飞短流长，害怕殃及我，不过，对于我的邀请，她还是很高兴的。后来，她见我嘴唇发抖，一脸失望的表情，便提出请我到她家去和她共进午餐。我显出一副受宠若惊的神情，她看在眼里，在我的手背上拍了拍。”

“你去了吗？”

“当然去了。她住在福煦大街旁一幢精致的小房子里，伺候我们的是一个长相酷似乔治·华盛顿的管家。我在那儿一直待到下午四点钟。我们让头发散开，脱掉胸衣，说了一大堆关于女人的秘事。那天下午学到的知识，能够用来写一本书。”

“那你为什么不写？这类稿件适合登在《女士之家杂志》上。”

“你真傻。”她哈哈笑了。

我沉默了一会儿，心里翻江倒海般思索着。

“真不知拉里是不是真的爱过你。”我最后说道。

她不听则已，一听蹭地坐直了身子，脸色大变，一双美眸怒气冲冲。

“你这说的是什么鬼话？他当然爱我。你以为一个女孩子连别人爱她，她都不知道？”

“这个嘛，也可以说他在某种程度上是爱你的。他认识的女孩子，你和他是关系最密切的一个。你们青梅竹马，两小无猜嘛。他指望着自己一定会爱上你的。他有着正常的性欲本能。你们结婚成家似乎是顺理成章的事情。结婚后，你们一同生活，同床共枕，除此之外，与别的夫妻相比，并无什么特殊之处。”

怒气稍微平息了些，伊莎贝尔等着我继续说下去。我知道女人家总喜欢听别人谈爱情，于是便又说道：

“道德家们有一种观点，认为性欲的本能与爱情关系不大。依照他们的说法，性欲的本能似乎仅仅是偶然的冲动。”

“这是什么荒唐理论呀？”

“有些心理学家认为，人的意识伴随着大脑的活动而出现，依赖于大脑的活动，而它本身对大脑不施加任何影响。人的意识犹如水中树影，离开树不能存在，但是对树丝毫没有影响。有人说，没有情也可以有爱，我认为是胡说；他们说即便情消失了，爱仍旧可以存在。其实，他们所谓的情，只是好感、善心、共同的品味、共同的兴趣和共同的习惯。尤其指的是习惯。出于习惯，男女双方可以一直保持性关系，就像一到吃饭时间就感到肚子饿一样。当然，没有爱情，也是可以有肉欲的。肉欲并非激情，而是性欲本能的自然产物，与人的其他动物功能相比并无出众之处。所以说，有些做丈夫的在时间和地点适合时偶尔放纵一下，他们的妻子那样大惊小怪，实在愚蠢。”

“光男人可以放纵吗？”

我笑了。

“如果你硬要问，那我就得承认，男人可以放纵，女人也是可以潇洒一下的。唯一不同的是，对于男人，露水关系并无感情可言，对于女人就不一样了。”

“那要看是什么样的女人了。”

我不想让自己的话被打断，于是继续说了下去。

“爱是有情欲的，否则就不是爱，而是别的东西。这种情欲不是因为得到满足，而是由于遭到阻挠，会变得愈加炽热。济慈曾经对着雕刻在希腊古瓮上的恋人画像，让她不要伤心，你以为他是什么意思？‘你永远在爱着，她永远美丽动人。’为什么？因为她是得不到手的。不管她的情人怎样疯狂地追求，都追不到手。因为二者都被囚禁在了我称之为冷漠艺术品的大理石石面上。你对拉里的爱，以及拉里对你的爱，和保罗与弗兰切斯卡[97]、罗密欧与朱丽叶[98]之间的爱一样，都是那般单纯和自然。幸好你们俩的结局并不悲惨。你嫁入一个富人之家，拉里则浪迹天涯去探寻海妖歌声[99]的秘密。你们之间没有情欲作祟。”

“你怎么知道呢？”

“情欲是不计代价的。帕斯卡[100]曾经说：人之心讲究理智，而理智却有失控的时候。如果我没理解错的话，他的意思是，情欲一旦控制了人心，就会编出理由来，不仅冠冕堂皇，而且好像真实可信，让人们觉得为了爱可以不管天塌地陷。你会觉得，牺牲掉荣誉是值得的，而耻辱仅是很小的代价。情欲是毁灭性的。它毁掉了安东尼与克莉奥佩特拉[101]，毁掉了特里斯坦和伊索尔德[102]，也毁掉了帕内尔和基蒂·奥谢[103]。只要情欲存在，就会有毁人的事情发生。梦醒时，你才发现自己荒废了一生中的大好年华，忍辱负重，经受着嫉妒的痛苦折磨，将所有的苦水一滴滴吞下肚，献给对方的是缱绻温情和灵魂中最宝贵的财富，而对方只不过是个可怜虫、蠢蛋，一个浪费了你许多春梦的饭桶，论价值还不如一块橡皮糖。”

这番议论还未说完，我便发现伊莎贝尔压根就没有听，而是在想自己的心事。而后，她便语出惊人。

“你看拉里是否仍是处男呢？”

“亲爱的，他已经三十二岁了。”

“我敢肯定他还是个处男。”

“何以见得？”

“这种事情，女人凭本能可以感觉得到。”

“我认识一个年轻人，此人在情场上如鱼得水，声称自己是处男，将漂亮的女孩子们一个个骗得晕头转向。据他说，这一招像施魔咒一样灵。”

“不管你怎么说，反正我是相信自己的直觉的。”

天色渐晚，格雷和伊莎贝尔要出去和朋友们吃饭，伊莎贝尔得换衣服。我无事可做，于是步上拉斯帕埃大街，踏着秋天迷人的暮色向前走去。对于女人的直觉我历来都不太相信，认为她们所谓的直觉只是主观的想法，是不可信的。想到和伊莎贝尔这番长谈，自己在末尾说的那段话，我不禁哑然失笑。这使我想起苏姗娜·鲁维埃来，发现自己已有多日未见她了，不知她在做什么事情。如果她闲着没事，也许愿意陪我吃顿饭、看场电影呢。我叫住一辆在街上转悠的出租车，把她公寓的地址告诉了司机。





七


在本书开篇的时候，我曾提到过苏姗娜·鲁维埃。我认识此人已有十一二年了，此时再提起，她恐怕已近不惑之年了。她并不漂亮，其实可以说其貌不扬。在法国女人里面，她个子算是高的，短身躯，长胳臂长腿，笨手笨脚，仿佛真不知如何摆布那么长的四肢才好。她凭着自己的心情将头发染成各种颜色，但多数时间她的头发是红褐色的。她有一张小小的四方脸，颧骨特别高，浓妆艳抹，大嘴巴，嘴唇上涂着厚厚的一层唇膏。这一说，好像她全无动人之处了，但偏偏还是有人看上了她。话又说回来，她皮肤很好，有一口结实的白牙和一双炯炯有神的蓝色大眼睛。眼睛算是她身上最漂亮的部位了，所以她便把睫毛和眼皮都染黑加以渲染。她看上去既精明又和善，像是见过世面的，本性既有宽厚的一面又有强硬的一面。在她的人生中，是不得不强硬的。她父亲是一个政府部门的小公务员，死后母亲守寡，回到安茹州她原来那个村庄，靠抚恤金过活。苏姗娜十五岁那年，被送到邻镇一个服装店里当学徒，那儿离家近，星期天可以回家。十七岁那年夏天，苏姗娜有两个星期假期，就在休假期间被一个来村子里画风景的画家勾引上了。她心里很清楚，家里一分钱的嫁妆也出不起，嫁人的事遥遥无期。所以，在夏天快完时，画家提出要带她到巴黎去，她便欣然答应了。他带她来到巴黎的蒙马特高地，住进一个兔子窝般大小的画室，二人相依相伴，度过了一年快乐的时光。

末了，他告诉她，说自己连一幅画也没有卖出去，再也养不起情妇了。她早就料到会有这一天，没有为之感到慌乱。他问她想不想回老家，她说不想，于是他就说同一个街区有个画家愿意跟她一起生活。他说的那个人曾经勾引过她两三次，被她拒绝了，但没伤和气，没有令对方感到难堪。对那人她并不感到讨厌，所以泰然地接受了这项提议。搬家很方便，用不着花钱叫出租车，提着箱子就过去了。这第二个情人比第一个年龄大许多，但仍像模像样的，让她摆各种姿势为她画像，有穿衣服的，也有裸体的。二人同居，高高兴兴度过了两年的时光。想起来让她感到自豪的是，他的第一张真正成功的画作是以她当模特儿的。她曾经让我看过那幅画，是从一份介绍此画的画报上剪下来的。这幅画后来被美国的一家画廊买了去。这是一幅裸体画，真人一般大小——她呈卧式，姿势和马奈的油画《奥林普》差不多。这个画家敏锐地发现她的身体比例有一种现代情趣，于是采用夸张的手法，将她原本消瘦的身子画得骨瘦如柴，把她的长胳膊长腿画得更长，两个高颧骨更为突出，一双蓝眼睛大得出奇。从剪下来的画上看不出用的是什么色调，但构图相当有看头。此画叫他名声大噪，赢得了一个阔寡妇的敬仰，二人喜结良缘。苏姗娜深知男人得以自己的前程为重，没吵没闹，和他断绝了这段你亲我爱的关系。

此时，她已认识到了自身的价值。她喜欢艺术家的那种生活，喜欢给画家当模特儿。干完一天的活，就去泡咖啡馆，跟画家们、画家的妻子和情妇坐在一起，听画家们谈论艺术，诅咒画商，讲些下流故事，她觉得这种生活很有情趣。在这期间，她已看到了自己与那位画家的关系快到了头，便打起了小算盘。她相中了一个身边没女人的年轻画家，觉得他很有才气。她瞅准机会，一次见这位画家单独坐在咖啡馆里，便向他讲了自己的处境，开门见山地提出想跟他一道过日子。

“我今年二十岁，持家有方，在家务方面能为你省下一笔钱，还能为你省下雇用模特儿的开销。瞧瞧你的衬衫，简直不像个样子，你的画室乱得像鸡窝。你需要有个女人照应你。”

画家早就知道她很能干，听了她的提议，产生了兴趣。她见对方有接受的意思，便接着说道：

“先试试反正也没有害处。万一行不通，咱俩谁也不会有损失的。”

他是个非表现派的画家，给她画像画的全是些四方块和长方块；画她只有一只眼睛，没有嘴；把她画成一幅黑、棕、灰色交织的几何图案；画成一大堆杂乱无章的线条，从中勉强可以看出一张人脸。她和他同居了一年半，后来自动离开了他。

“为什么要走？”我问她，“你不喜欢他吗？”

“喜欢倒是喜欢，他是个挺不错的小伙子，只是觉得他再不会有进步了，老是重复自己。”

没费吹灰之力，她又傍上了一个画家。不管跟谁，她始终都不离开画家圈子。

“我一直都在画界打转。”她说，“我和一个雕塑家待过半年，但不知为什么总觉得没情没趣的。”

每次跟情人分手，从没有出现过叫人不愉快的事情，这让她想起来都感到高兴。她不仅是个出色的模特儿，也是个能干的主妇。不管住进哪个画室，她都喜欢那一方之地，把画室收拾得整整齐齐，并以此而感到自豪。她厨艺精湛，花很少一点钱就能烧出极为可口的饭菜。情人的袜子破了她给补，情人衣服上的扣子掉了她给缝。

“我简直就不明白为什么一个人因为是个画家，就不能穿得整整齐齐的。”

她只有一次日子过不下去的。那是和一个英国小伙子的往事。那人比她以前的任何一个情人都有钱，而且还有一辆汽车。

“不过，我们俩没多久便分手了。”她说，他酗酒成性，一喝醉便叫人心烦。如果他的画好，我也不会在乎的，可是，亲爱的，他的那些画全是涂鸦之作。我跟他说要离开他了，他就哭了起来，说他爱我。

“‘我可怜的朋友，’我对他说，‘你爱不爱我都无关紧要。关键是你没有绘画的天赋。还是回到你们国家去吧，开家杂货铺。你适合干那一行。’”

“他听了后怎么说？”我问。

“他听了勃然大怒，让我赶快滚蛋。你知道，忠言是逆耳的。真希望他能听人劝。他不是个坏人，只是画技太差。”

在风月场上，对于一个风尘女子而言，世情练达、心地善良是有好处的，可以化解一部分困难，但欲海情波中毕竟有许多沉浮，苏姗娜也不例外。她和那个斯堪的纳维亚人的恋情堪为借鉴。她千不该万不该，就不该坠入那张情网。

“他简直就是天神一样的人物，”她告诉我说，“个子特别高，高得就像埃菲尔铁塔，宽肩膀、阔胸脯，腰细得用两只手几乎就可以围过来，肚子扁平，平得和我的手掌一样，肌肉结实得像个职业运动员，一头金黄色的卷发，皮肤细如白瓷。他的画技也不错。我喜欢他的笔触——大胆而有力，他的着色丰富活泼。”

她算计着想和他生个孩子。对方坚决反对，可她说孩子由她负责抚养。

“后来生了个女孩，他爱如掌上明珠。那孩子可爱极了，玫瑰色的皮肤，金色的头发，蓝色的眼睛，酷似她的爸爸。”

苏姗娜和他同居，度过了三年的时光。

“他有点愚蠢，有时候叫人心烦。不过，他十分殷勤，而且长得那么英俊，我也就不太在乎了。”

后来，他接到瑞典的一封电报，说他父亲病危，要他立刻回家。他满口答应一定回来，可是苏姗娜有个预感，觉得他会一去不复返。他把所有的钱都留给了苏姗娜，走后一个月杳无音信。后来，苏姗娜收到他的一封信，说父亲已去世，一大堆乱麻一样的事情需要料理，说自己必须对母亲尽孝，留下来经营木材生意。信中附了一张一万法郎的支票。苏姗娜可不是那种遇事便一蹶不振的人。她当下就做出了判断，认为有个孩子在身边会妨碍她做那半掩门的生意。故而，她将小女儿带到乡下，把女儿连同那一万法郎交给自己的母亲，托她代为抚养。

“我的心都快碎了。我爱那孩子，但过日子得讲求实际呀。”

“以后的情况怎样？”

“唉，混日子呗。我又找到了一个朋友。”

后来，她染上了伤寒。提起那病，她总是说“我的伤寒”，就像百万富翁炫耀自己的度假地时说“我的棕榈滩”或者“我的松鸡泽”一样。那场病差点要了她的命，让她在医院里躺了三个月。出院时，她已骨瘦如柴，弱不禁风，神经脆弱得动不动就想哭。她成了个没有价值的窝囊废，当模特儿吧，身体支撑不下来，口袋里的钱已所剩无几。

“哎呀呀[104]，”她说道，“那是一段艰难的日月。幸亏我还有些好朋友帮忙。不过，你也知道画家的窘境，个个日子都过得紧巴巴的。我从来就不怎么漂亮，只是有点魅力罢了。但毕竟不再是二十岁的青春女子了。后来碰上了那个曾经跟我同居过的立体派画家。自从我们分手之后，他结了婚，随即又离了。他已放弃了立体派画风，秉承了超现实派的衣钵。他觉得可以利用我，于是说自己单身很孤独，提出和我一道生活，给我提供食宿。实不相瞒，我当下就同意了。”

就这样，苏姗娜一直和这位画家生活在一起，直至那位制造商出现。制造商是一个朋友领到画室来的，指望着能买一幅这位前立体派画家的画。苏姗娜一心想促成这笔生意，于是施展出手段来热情待客。制造商不能当场决定买还是不买，但是说过后再来看看。两个星期后，他果然来了。这一次，苏姗娜有个印象：他是来看她的，而非看画。离开时，他仍旧没有买，跟她握手时用了一点劲，显得有些过分亲热。次日，那个领制造商来看画的朋友趁她到菜市场买菜之际，半路截住了她，说制造商看上了她，下次来巴黎时，想请她吃顿饭，到时候有话跟她说。

“你觉得他看上了我什么呢？”她问道。

“他是现代艺术的爱好者，见过你的肖像画，极为倾倒。他是外省人，而且是做生意的。你在他眼中代表着巴黎、艺术、爱情——这些都是他在生活中所缺乏的。”

“他有钱吗？”她理智地问。

“有许多钱。”

“那好，我愿意和他吃饭。他有什么话，听听也无妨。”

制造商带她去马克西姆饭店吃饭，给她留下了好印象。她的穿着十分素雅。瞧瞧周围的女人，相比之下，她觉得自己看起来不错，非常像一个体面的已婚女子。他叫了一瓶女士香槟，让她觉得他很有绅士风度。饭后喝咖啡的时候，他将开出的条件摆在了她面前。她一听，认为对方很是慷慨。他告诉她，说自己每两个星期要来巴黎开一次董事会。晚上吃饭老是孤零零的一个人，想女人就去找青楼女子，日子过得味如嚼蜡。他结了婚，有两个孩子，但以他这种身份的人，过这种日子难以令人满意。他们俩都认识的那个朋友把她的情况如实告诉了他，他觉得她是个识进退的女子。他已不再年轻，不愿跟不懂事的女孩子纠缠在一起。他怎么也算是个现代艺术的收藏家，而她和画界联系紧密，跟他有共同语言。接下来，他讲了具体安排，说准备给她租套公寓，然后装修一下，每月给她两千法郎的零花钱。作为交换，他希望每两个星期能和她共同度过一个良夜佳宵。苏姗娜以前从未有过这许多钱供她私用。她飞快计算了一下，觉得这笔钱不仅够她吃饭穿衣，过衣食无忧的日子，还可以供养女儿，另外能再积攒一些以备不时之需。不过，她还是犹豫了一下。她素来以“画界人”自居，显然还是觉得给一个生意人当情妇未免有些掉价。

“Cest à prendre ou à laisser[105]，”他说，“你可以接受，也可以不接受。”

她并不讨厌他，而且看见了他纽扣孔里镶嵌的玫瑰花状的荣誉胸章，认定他是个有头有脸的人，于是冲他嫣然一笑。

“Je prends[106]，”她回答说，“我接受。”





八


苏姗娜虽说一直住在蒙马特高地，此时却觉得有必要与过去一刀两断，于是就在蒙巴纳斯街区离林荫道不远处的一幢公寓楼里租了一套房，里面包括两个房间、一个小厨房和一个浴室。此房位于六层，不过是配有电梯的。那电梯一次只能搭乘两人，慢得像蜗牛爬，下楼还得步行。但是，浴室和电梯对她而言，不仅代表的是奢华的生活，也是一种时髦。

二人同居的头几个月，阿吉里·高凡先生（此为制造商的名字），每隔两个星期来到巴黎一趟，下榻于一个旅馆，受炽热欲望的驱使，跟苏姗娜做完好事，然后再回到旅馆独眠，次日起床乘火车回去料理事务，享受静谧、愉快的家庭生活。后来，苏姗娜向他指出，说那样糟蹋钱是毫无道理的，完全可以留在公寓里，早晨再走，既省钱又少受点罪。他觉得此话说得有理。苏姗娜这一番知痛知痒的话说得他心里暖洋洋的。说真的，冬夜天气冷，跑上街头拦出租车，可不是件好受的事。至于她不愿让他花冤枉钱，也打动了他的心。一个女人，既懂得自己省开销，也知道为情人节省铜板，这才是好女人。

阿吉里先生对现状感到十分满意。他们俩一般都是下馆子，到蒙巴纳斯街区比较好的餐馆吃饭，但有的时候，苏姗娜也会亲自下厨，留他在公寓里吃饭。她烧得一手好菜，很对阿吉里先生的口味。吃晚饭时，如果天气暖和，阿吉里先生就脱掉外衣，只穿一件衬衫，感觉很有一种无拘无束、放荡不羁的艺术家风范。他一直对画品情有独钟，喜欢买画，但苏姗娜对于自己看不上的画，绝对不允许他买。没过多久，他便发现苏姗娜眼光独到，值得信赖了。苏姗娜不让他和中间人打交道，而是直接把他带到画家的画室里去买，所花的钱只抵在外面买画的一半。阿吉里先生知道她在攒钱，后来她告诉他，说她每年都要在老家的村子里添置一些地产，阿吉里听了为她感到很是自豪。他清楚，在每个法国人的血液里都涌动着拥有土地的欲望，而就是因为苏姗娜拥有了土地，故而对她的敬重又增加了几分。

苏姗娜这一边也是心满意足的。她对阿吉里先生既忠实，也不忠实。这就是说，她留意着不和别的男人保持固定的关系，但如果碰上看得上眼的，也不反对与对方行云雨之欢。但是，她绝不留意中人在家里过夜，这涉及良心的问题。她觉得自己欠那位有钱有地位的阿吉里先生一份情，因为正是阿吉里先生让她衣食无忧，过上了稳定和有尊严的生活。

我是在苏姗娜和一位画家同居时认识她的。这位画家是我的一个相识。苏姗娜在他绘画时为他当模特儿，我时常坐在旁边看。我也只是隔上一段时间偶尔见见她，直至她迁入蒙巴纳斯街区，和她的交往才密切了起来。

事情是这样的——阿吉里先生（她无论是提到还是当面称呼那位制造商都是这么叫的）读了一两本我的小说的法译本，于是，在某天晚上，请我到一家饭馆里和他们一起吃饭。他五短身材，比苏姗娜矮半个头，铁灰色的头发，八字胡修剪得整整齐齐，稍微有点偏胖，肚子突起，但并非大腹便便，仅仅衬托出了他的派头和气质而已。他走路迈着矮胖男人的那种四方步，一副意气风发的样子。这顿饭十分丰盛。他对我非常客气，说很高兴苏姗娜有我这样的朋友。他说一眼就看出我是个好人[107]，对于我如此看得起苏姗娜而感到欣慰。他杂事太多，使他在里尔脱不了身，让可怜的苏姗娜倍感寂寞，多亏有我这等文化人相伴，真是叫人舒心。他虽然是生意人，对艺术家却素有敬仰之心。

“啊，我亲爱的先生[108]，艺术和文学一直是法兰西的一对瑰宝。当然，它的军事实力可与之并驾齐驱。我是个毛织品制造商，不偏不倚，毫不犹豫地会将画家和作家放在与将军及政治家同等的位置。”

他的一席话说得无比入耳。

苏姗娜坚决不愿请女佣料理家务，一半是为了省钱，一半是因为（她自己知道得最清楚）她不喜欢有人插手于纯粹属于她个人分内的事物。那套小公寓被她收拾得干干净净、整整齐齐，而且按照当时最时新的式样加以陈设；所有的内衣都由她自己亲手来缝制。可是，即便如此，由于她不再当模特儿，时间仍多得难以打发。鉴于她是个闲不住的人，不久便心生一念：为那么多画家当过模特儿，她自己也应该画上几笔。说干就干，她立刻买来画布、画笔和油彩等用品，动手画了起来。有时候，我带她出去吃饭，去得早一点，就会看见她穿着罩衫在忙着作画。与胎儿在子宫里重现物种进化的过程基本一样，苏姗娜也重现了她过去所有情人的风格。她画风景像那个风景画家，画抽象画像那个立体派画家，还以风景明信片为参照画了一只停泊的帆船，画风跟那个斯堪的纳维亚人的一样。她的画技很糟，但色彩感不错。即便画得不怎么样，她却从中获得了不少乐趣。阿吉里先生对她大加鼓励。想到自己的情妇是个画家，使他心里有一种满足感。在他的敦促之下，苏姗娜送了一张画去参加秋季沙龙。看见那幅画挂在展厅里，二人都颇为之自豪。阿吉里先生给她提了一条忠告。

“画的时候，不要像男人一样阳刚气十足，亲爱的，”他说道，“而应有女性的温柔。不求笔锋遒劲，但求柔美入眼。画风应该求实。生意场上弄虚作假有时能出奇制胜，但在艺术上求实至上，也是唯一可行之道。”

故事写到此处，他们俩交往已有五年之久，彼此都感到很满意。

“显然，他并非叫我热血沸腾的那种人，”苏姗娜告诉我说，“但他是智慧型的，有着很好的社会地位。我也老大不小了，应该考虑考虑退路了。”

她富于同情之心，明白事理。阿吉里先生很尊重她的意见。他把生意场上的事和家里的事讲给她听时，她会侧着耳朵倾听。他女儿有一次考试落榜，她跟着他一道难过。他的儿子与一个有钱人家的千金订婚，她则和他一起高兴。他本人娶的就是一个同行人家的独生女。两个厂家原来是对头，这一联姻对双方都有好处。现在儿子也懂得了这个道理，知道幸福的婚姻必须有共同的物质利益作为坚实的基础，这叫他感到舒心。他推心置腹地告诉苏姗娜，说他有个野心，想把女儿嫁给贵族。

“她有的是钱，这是顺理成章的事。”苏姗娜说。

阿吉里先生替苏姗娜着想，把苏姗娜的女儿送进了一所女修道院办的学校，让她在那儿接受良好的教育，答应等她女儿到适当的年龄时，由他出钱去学习打字和速记，以便日后靠此谋生。

“她长大后一定是个大美女。”苏姗娜告诉我，“反正受点教育，以后会打字，是没有坏处的。她现在还小，什么事都难以预料，说不定她会变得缺乏气质呢。”

苏姗娜的话藏头露尾，弦外之音由着我去猜想了。我当然是能猜得出来的。





九


大概一个多星期后，我竟然和拉里出人意料地相遇了。一天晚上，我和苏姗娜看了电影，下了馆子，然后到蒙巴纳斯林荫道上的精英酒馆喝啤酒。就在这时，拉里慢慢悠悠走了进来。苏姗娜吃了一惊。令我感到意外的是，她喊住了他。拉里闻声走过来，吻吻她，和我握了握手。我看得出，苏姗娜惊讶极了，简直不敢相信自己的眼睛。

“我可以坐下吗？”他说，“我还没有吃晚饭，得要点东西填填肚子。”

“啊，见到你真高兴，我的宝贝[109]。”苏姗娜说道，眼睛里闪着亮光，“你这是从哪里蹦出来的？怎么这么多年连个人影都不见？天呀，看你瘦得跟个鬼一样！我还以为你死了呢。”

“哦，我没有死。”拉里眨巴了几下眼睛说，“奥德特近来可好？”

奥德特是苏姗娜女儿的芳名。

“好着呢。她现在长成个大姑娘了，很漂亮。她还记着你呢。”

“你从没说过你认识拉里。”我埋怨苏姗娜说。

“我怎么能说呢？我又不知道你认识他。我们是老朋友了。”

拉里给自己要了份鸡蛋和火腿。苏姗娜把女儿的情况以及她自己的情况细细给拉里讲了讲。她讲起来滔滔不绝，拉里则耐心听着，脸上挂着微笑。她告诉拉里，说她有了安定的生活，目前正在作画。她还把脸转向我说：

“我有了长进，你看是不是？我不敢说自己是个天才，但是论才气，与许多我认识的画家相比，我还是巾帼不让须眉的。”

“你的画卖不卖？”拉里问。

“我没必要卖画，”苏姗娜快活地说，“我的生活是有着落的。”

“你运气好呀。”

“错了，这不是运气不运气，而是智慧。你可一定要来看看我的画哟。”

她把自己的住址写在一张纸上，硬逼着拉里一定要去看画。她心情激动，喋喋不休说个没完。后来，拉里叫侍者过来埋单。

“你这就走吗？”她嚷嚷道。

“是的。”拉里微微一笑说。

他付过钱，冲着我们摆摆手，然后飘然而去。我哈哈大笑。他这种派头一直使我觉得很特别——刚才还和你在一起，转眼不见了人影，连句解释的话也没有，来去如风，仿佛消失在了空气里。

“他为什么这么急着走呢？”苏姗娜着恼地问。

“也许有个女孩子在等他吧。”我半开玩笑地说。

“这话说得没名头。”她从包里取出粉盒，往脸上扑了些粉，“哪一个女人爱上了他，算她倒霉。算啦，算啦。[110]”

“此话怎讲？”

她打量了一下我，表情严肃起来（很少见她这么严肃过）。

“在过去，我自己就差点爱上他。爱他，无异于爱水里的倒影、天上的阳光或云朵。幸亏我没有深陷其中。回想起当时的险境，我至今还会吓得打哆嗦。”

好奇心一起，势不可当。换上谁，也都急切想知道中间有什么故事。值得庆幸的是，苏姗娜肚子里藏不住事，是个有话就说的人。

“你到底是怎么和他相识的？”我问道。

“哦，那是多年前的事了。是七年前还是八年前，我记不得了。奥德特那时才五岁。他认识马塞尔，而我和马塞尔住在一起。他常来画室看马塞尔画我，有时候就约我们出去吃饭。你说不准他什么时候就会冒出来。有时候几个星期不见他的面，随后又连着两三天往我们那儿跑。马塞尔喜欢让他来，说有他在跟前，自己的画会画得好些。后来，我染上伤寒住进医院，出院后一下子陷入了困境。”说到此处，她耸了耸肩膀，这些事以前都给你讲过了。一天，我到各个画室里去，想找份工作，却没人愿意要我。整整一天，我只喝了一杯牛奶，吃了一只羊角面包，晚上连住宿费都没有。走到克利希大街，不知怎么却碰上了拉里。他停住脚步，问我日子过得怎么样。我把生病的事给他说了。他听后对我说：‘你看上去得先吃顿饱饭。’他的声音和眼神里有一种东西叫我十分感动，弄得我哭了起来。

我们站的那个地方隔壁就是马里埃特大妈餐馆。他挽起我的胳膊走进去，寻一张餐桌叫我坐下。我肚子饿极了，觉得自己恐怕连整整一头牛都能吞下肚。可是，夹着蔬菜和肉的煎蛋卷端上来时，我却一口也吃不下去了。他逼着我吃了一些，然后给我要了杯勃艮第葡萄酒。一杯酒下肚，我感觉精神了些，然后又吃了点炒芦笋。接下来，我就大倒苦水，把满腹的委屈都告诉了他。我弱不禁风，当不成模特儿；又瘦得皮包骨头，面容憔悴，根本没指望能找个情夫。我问他能不能借给我一点钱，助我回老家去——起码，我还有个小女儿在那里呢。他问我是不是真的想回去，我说当然并非真的想回。妈妈不会愿意接收我的。物价那么高，靠那点抚恤金，她的处境举步维艰；我寄给奥德特的钱已经全部花光。不过，到了家门口，她见我病成这个样子，恐怕也不会将我拒之门外的。拉里看着我，看了好长时间，我以为他会拒绝我，不愿借钱给我呢，然而却听他这样说：‘你愿不愿随我去乡下的一个地方，把你的孩子也带上？我刚好也需要休一段时间的假。’我简直不敢相信自己的耳朵，因为我认识他那么久，没见他对我有过意思。

‘就凭我现在这副模样，你还要我？’我说完，忍不住大笑起来，‘可怜的朋友，我眼下这副惨象，任何男人都不会要我的。’

他听了冲我莞尔一笑。他的笑是那么迷人，你注意过没有？那种笑容甜如蜜糖。

‘别胡扯，’他说，‘我指的不是那档子事。’

“我当时感动得哭成了泪人儿，连话都说不出了。他给我钱，把孩子接出来，我们一起到了乡下。啊，他领我们母女去的那个地方真是美极了。”

苏姗娜对我把那地方描绘了一番，说那儿离一个小镇有三英里远（小镇的名字我记不起来了）。他们乘汽车去了一家客栈。客栈是一幢摇摇欲坠的房屋，位于河畔，房前有一片草坪直达水边。草坪上长着几棵梧桐树，他们就在树荫下吃饭。夏天会有画家到那儿写生，但他们去时，还未到写生季，所以客栈里只有他们几个客人。客栈里的饭菜闻名遐迩。每逢星期天，人们会开着车赶来大快朵颐。但是在别的日子里，他们宁静的生活很少受到打搅。苏姗娜得到充足的休息，享用着好酒好肉，身体逐渐好了起来。而且，有孩子在身边，这叫她感到很幸福。

“他对奥德特非常好，奥德特也很喜欢他。她老缠着拉里，我拦都拦不住，可拉里好像并不介意她的纠缠。他俩在一起，就像两个不懂事的小孩子，常常逗得我大笑不止。”

“你们都做些什么呢？”我问。

“哦，总有事做的。有时划船、钓鱼，有时则把客栈老板[111]的雪铁龙牌汽车借来开着到镇上去。拉里喜欢那个小镇。那儿有古老的房屋和广场[112]，周围异常安静，鸦雀无声，只能听得到你自己走在石板路上的脚步声。镇上有一个路易十四时期的市政厅[113]和一座老教堂；小镇边上矗立着一座城堡和一个勒诺特尔[114]设计的花园。当你坐在广场[115]旁的咖啡店里的时候，你会觉得时光倒流，又回到了三百年前，而马路边停放的那辆雪铁龙好像根本不属于这个世界。”

在一次出游之后，拉里把本书开头时所讲过的那个年轻飞行员的故事告诉了苏姗娜。

“真不明白他为什么给你讲这个。”我说道。

“我也不知道为什么。战争期间，小镇上有所医院和一座公墓，公墓里有一排排的十字架。我们去那儿看过，没有久留。那地方叫我毛骨悚然——那么多可怜的年轻人长眠在那儿。返回的路上，拉里默默无语。他平时就吃得不多，而那天晚饭时几乎粒米未进。我记得非常清楚，那天的夜晚很美，满天的星，我们坐在河沿上，白杨树在黑暗中影影绰绰的，景色很美，拉里抽着烟斗。忽然间，非常突兀地[116]，他讲起了他的那位朋友，说那位朋友为了他而献出了生命。”苏姗娜喝了一口啤酒，又说了下去，“他是个怪人。我永远也理解不透他。他喜欢念书给我听，有时是在白天，我边听边给小家伙缝缝补补，有时是在晚上，在我打发小家伙睡觉之后。”

“他都念些什么？”

“形形色色的，什么都有。其中有塞维尼夫人[117]的《书简集》，也有圣西蒙[118]的《回忆录》。想想看，我以前除了报纸什么都不看，有时偶尔读上一本小说，也是在画室里听别人议论，又不愿让他们把我当白痴看待，才去读的。想不到读书竟能引人入胜。其实，过去的那些作品并非像人们想象的那么枯燥乏味。”

“谁会那么想象呢？”我扑哧笑了。

“后来，他叫我跟他一起念。我们一起念《费德尔》[119]和《贝蕾妮丝》[120]。他念男人的台词，我念女人的台词。你都不知道那是多么有意思。”她天真地补充了一句，“念到催人泪下的台词，我会泣不成声，而他则用不解的目光望着我。当然喽，我的身体还没有恢复过来，才那么多愁善感。实不相瞒，那些书我至今还保留着呢。即便在今日，看看他曾给我念过的塞维尼夫人的《书简集》，似乎仍能听见他那可爱的声音，仍能看见静静流淌的河水以及对岸婆娑的树影。有的时候，拿起书我都看不下去，只觉得心里隐隐作痛。现在我认识到那几个星期是我一生中最快乐的时光。他这个人，真是像天使一样可爱。”

苏姗娜觉得自己有点感情冲动，生怕我会笑她（这是错误的判断）。讲到这里，她耸了耸肩膀，笑着说：

“要知道，我心里也盘算好了，等到我人老珠黄，没有男人愿意跟我睡觉时，我就皈依教门，忏悔自己的罪恶。可是，我和拉里犯下的那些罪恶，我无论如何也不会忏悔的。绝不，绝不忏悔！”

“可是，根据你的描述，实在看不出来你有什么可忏悔的。”

故事的后半截我还没讲呢。你也可以看得到，我的身体素质原本是很好的，那段时间成天在户外待着，吃得好，睡得香，无忧无虑，不出三四个星期，我就跟从前一样健健康康的了，样子也好看了，脸蛋红红的，头发有了光泽，感觉就像二十岁一样。拉里每天早上在河里游泳，我时常在一旁看他。他的身体长得很美，不像我那个斯堪的纳维亚人的运动员型的身体，而是结实有力，非常入眼。

“我身体差的时候，他表现得相当有耐心，现在彻底恢复了健康，就没有理由叫他再继续等下去了。于是，我向他暗示了一两次，表示我已经准备好了，可他好像不明白似的。当然，你们盎格鲁撒克逊人是很怪的，野蛮粗鲁，同时又多愁善感。谈情说爱并非你们的长项，这是无法否认的。我对自己说：‘也许，他比较含蓄吧。他为我做了那么多的事情，还让我把孩子也带了来，可能不愿叫我报答他的恩情。反正他有他的理由。’一天夜里，大家都准备睡觉时，我对他说：‘今天夜里，你要我到你的房间吗？’”

我听了哈哈大笑。

“你说话可有点太直白了，是不是？”

“这个嘛，我又不能让他来我的房间，因为奥德特睡在里边。”她率直地回答说，他用他那双和善的眼睛看了我一下，然后笑眯眯地问：‘你愿意来吗？’

‘你的身体那么诱人，你说我能不愿意吗？’

‘好吧，那你就来吧。’

“我上了楼，脱掉衣服，然后，沿着过道溜进他的房间。他正躺在床上看书，抽着烟斗。见了我，他便放下烟斗和书，挪挪身子，给我腾出点地方。”

说到此处，苏姗娜沉默了一会儿。我也不好意思再朝下问。不过，过了片刻，她又继续说了下去。

“他是个很奇怪的情人，和蔼可亲、感情真挚，甚至可以说是温柔体贴，散发着阳刚之气，却并非激情勃发，希望你能理解我的意思——他的情欲是纯真无邪的。他的那种爱情就像热血沸腾的青年学生的恋情。当时的情形很滑稽，却又令人十分感动。我离开时，觉得应当是我感谢他，而不是他感谢我。当我带上门时，看见他又拿起书，从刚才中断的地方继续看了下去。”

我一听又大笑起来。

“很高兴这能叫你感到开心。”她有点不快地说。不过，她自己也觉得有点滑稽，便也咯咯笑了起来。“我很快就发现，要是等他邀请我，那就等八辈子也等不来。所以，我一旦想干那种事，就溜进他的房间，爬上他的床。每一次他都来者不拒。按说，他也有人的那种自然本能，然而他却像个心不在焉的人，有时会忘记吃饭，当你把丰盛的饭菜摆在他面前时，他则吃得津津有味。一个人爱不爱我，我是清楚的。如果我认为拉里爱我，那我就是个傻瓜。但我认为，这样的生活方式他终究会习惯的。一个人，是必须讲求实际的。我心想，如果回到巴黎，他让我和他一道生活，我会很高兴的。我知道他一定会叫我把孩子留在身边，这一点非常合我的意。我的本能告诫我，只有傻瓜才会坠入情网。你知道女人是很不幸的，一旦坠入情网，就变得不可爱了。我决定让自己时刻保持警惕，绝不栽这个跟头。”

苏姗娜抽了一口香烟，然后把烟从鼻孔里喷出来。时间已晚，许多桌子都已经空了。不过，仍有一些顾客围坐在吧台那儿。

一天上午，吃过了早饭，我坐在河畔做针线活，奥德特在玩拉里给她买的积木。就在这时，拉里走到了我跟前。

‘我是来向你告别的。’他说。

‘你要走了吗？’我诧异地问。

‘是的。’

‘再不回来啦？’我问道。

‘你现在已经完全康复。这里有一笔钱够你这个夏天用的，可以帮你回到巴黎后重新生活。’

一时间，我心里非常难过，都不知道说什么好了。他站在我的面前，笑吟吟的，笑容仍是那般灿烂。

‘我是不是有哪些地方叫你不高兴啦？’我问他。

‘没有的事。千万别这么想。我有工作要做。在这儿，咱们度过了一段美好的时光。奥德特，到这儿来，跟叔叔说再见。’

“孩子太小，不知道是怎么回事。拉里把她抱起来吻了吻，然后也吻了我。随即，他回到了客栈去，不一会儿我就听见了汽车开走的声音。我看了看他塞入我手里的钞票，竟有一万两千法郎之多。事情来得突然，我连反应的时间都没有。‘真是活见鬼！[121]’我对自己这么说了一声。起码有一点得感谢上帝——幸好我没有让自己爱上他。他的所作所为，叫人感到一头雾水。”

我忍俊不禁，笑了起来。

“要知道，过去有个时候，我只是把实情告诉世人，结果给自己赢得了一个幽默作家的美称。大多数人都觉得意外，以为我在说笑话。”

“我看不出你的话跟此事有什么联系。”

“哦，这么说吧——在我认识的人当中，拉里是唯一一个超然物外的人。这让他的行为显得很特殊。有一类人，他们并不相信上帝，所作所为却都是为了上帝之爱，这类人是叫世人看不惯的。”

苏姗娜望着我发呆。

“我可怜的朋友，你的酒喝得太多了。”





第五章


一


我在巴黎写作，三天打鱼两天晒网。此时春光明媚，令人心情愉悦，爱丽舍田园大街上的栗花盛开，大街小巷一片灿烂的光芒。空气中荡漾着欢乐的气氛，那气氛轻快却短暂，使你会产生浪漫但不下流的情绪，令你脚步轻盈、才思敏捷。终日有朋友们陪伴，我感到很快活，心中充满了对往事温馨的回忆，至少在精神上恢复了些许青春的活力。这样的欢乐时光转瞬即逝，恐怕今生今世再也享受不到，我觉得如果用工作加以打扰，那纯粹是愚蠢之举。

伊莎贝尔、格雷、拉里和我常常一同去游览近处的名胜——尚蒂伊[122]、凡尔赛、圣日尔曼和枫丹白露。无论去何处，我们的午饭都吃得好而丰盛。格雷个头大，食量就大，酒也喝得不少。不知是由于拉里的妙手回春，还是由于时间的作用，他的健康状况颇见好转。那种头痛欲裂的感觉已不复存在。以前到巴黎来，跟他有了初交，那时看到他眼里有一种迷茫的神情，令人见了心碎，而今那种神情已经消失。他说话不多，只是偶尔讲上一个故事寻开心，但听见我和伊莎贝尔天南海北的那一通胡扯，他会哈哈大笑，笑声朗朗。和我们在一起，他玩得很开心。他虽然并不风趣，但脾气好，随遇而安，你会不由得喜欢上他。这种人，你不愿意和他度过一个寂寞无聊的夜晚，却很可能会愿意跟他在一起待上半年的时光。

他爱伊莎贝尔，让人见了为伊莎贝尔感到高兴。他崇拜她的美，觉得她是天下最漂亮、最迷人的女子。他忠实于拉里，就像一条小狗忠实于自己的主人，使人颇为感动。拉里似乎玩得也很开心。我有一种感觉：他将眼前的时光看作假日，不管心里有什么打算，都暂时放在一边，静下心来尽情享受。他也少言寡语的，但这无关紧要，有他在跟前，无言胜有言。他态度随和，满面春风，让你觉得这就足够了。我非常清楚，正是由于他在跟前，我们在一起度过的日子才那么充满了欢乐。他虽然没说过一句精彩或幽默的话，但没有了他，我们会感到乏味无聊。

一次出游归来，途中我目睹了一幕场景——那场景吓了我一跳。我们游历了沙特尔，当时正从那儿返回巴黎。格雷开车，拉里坐在副驾驶的位子上。我和伊莎贝尔坐在后排。玩了一天，大家都累散了架。拉里的一只胳膊伸开，搭在前座的椅背上。这个姿势使他的袖口拉了上去，露出瘦长而有力的手腕和微微长了一层茸毛的棕色皮肤的小臂。阳光把那些茸毛染成了黄金色。伊莎贝尔一点声息没有，使我觉得有异，便瞥了她一眼。她一动不动，简直就像是受到了催眠似的。她呼吸急促，眼睛死死盯着那长了金黄茸毛的结实手腕以及那只瘦削、修长而有力的手，脸上一副饿狼似的色相——那色相我在任何人的脸上都没有见到过。她的脸就像是个面具，燃烧着肉欲。我怎么也没想到，她那漂亮的脸上会出现如此荒淫无耻的表情。那是野兽的兽欲，而非人的欲望。她脸上的美不见了，取而代之的是狰狞和恐怖。那情景让人厌恶，使得她就像一只发情的母狗，我看了感到一阵恶心。她无视我的存在，什么都感觉不到了，只盯着那只随随便便搭在椅背上的手，心里升腾起熊熊的欲火。后来，她的脸上掠过了一阵痉挛和抽搐。只见她浑身一哆嗦，闭上眼睛，靠回到了汽车的角落里。

“给我一根烟。”她说道，粗声粗气的，叫我都听不出来是她的声音了。

我从烟盒里取出一根烟，为她点着。她狠狠地抽了一口。在余下的路程中，她始终望着窗外，再也没有说一句话。

回到公寓楼时，格雷请拉里开车送我回旅馆，然后将车停放在车库里。拉里坐到了驾驶员的座位上，我坐到他旁边。只见那两口子在穿过人行道时，伊莎贝尔挽着格雷的胳臂，靠紧他，看了他一眼。我虽然看不清那是什么样的眼神，却也能猜出个八九不离十。我心想，格雷夜里会发现自己的妻子特别狂热，但他永远也不会知道伊莎贝尔是由于良心发现才对他热情似火的。

六月份已接近尾声，我得回里维埃拉去了。艾略特的朋友到美国去，把他们在迪纳尔[123]的别墅借给马图林夫妇住，这小两口准备等孩子们一放暑假就到那儿去。拉里打算留在巴黎工作，但给自己买了一辆二手的雪铁龙汽车，答应八月份上他们那儿去住几天。在我离开巴黎的前夕，我请他们三个人和我一同吃晚饭。就在这天晚上，我们和索菲·麦克唐纳不期而遇。





二


伊莎贝尔突发奇想，想到那些野去处瞧一瞧，鉴于我在那儿有熟人，便请我当向导。我老大不愿意，因为巴黎的这种地方不喜欢叫外人进去参观，他们对此毫不掩饰，十分叫人扫兴。可是，伊莎贝尔非去不行。我提前告诉她，说那种地方非常叫人倒胃口，吩咐她穿着一定要朴素。我们很迟才吃晚饭，饭后去女神影院[124]看了一个小时的短片。接下来，我先带他们到圣母院附近的一处地下室，那儿是流氓恶棍和他们的姘头常来常往之地。我认识此处的老板，他为我们安排位子，让我们坐到一张长条桌旁，同桌的顾客是几个不三不四的人。我为所有的人都要了杯酒，大家相互敬酒。屋子里闷热、肮脏，乌烟瘴气的。后来，我又带他们去了斯芬克斯舞厅，舞厅里的女人们穿着华丽却俗气，袒胸露怀，面对面坐在两张长凳子上，乐队奏舞曲时，她们便到舞池里无精打采地跳舞，一边用眼睛搜索中意的男人——那些男客散坐在舞厅各处的大理石面桌子旁。我们叫了一瓶未冰镇的香槟酒。有些女人经过我们面前时，会给伊莎贝尔抛个眼色，我不知道伊莎贝尔是否明白其中的含意。

随后，我们又去了拉佩街。那是一条脏兮兮、路面狭窄的小街。一到这儿，你就会油然产生污秽下流的印象。走进一家咖啡馆，只见一个面色苍白、沉迷于酒色的年轻人在弹钢琴，另有一个倦容满面的老头在刺刺拉拉地抚琴，还有一个吹萨克斯管的，吹出来的调子杂乱无章。咖啡馆里人满为患，好像一张空桌子都没有了。不过，老板看出我们是肯花钱的主顾，便毫不客气地把一对男女赶到另外一张已经坐了人的桌子去，请我们在空下来的桌旁坐下。被赶走的那两个人很不服气，说了一些让我们难以入耳的话。舞池里有许多人——有帽子上缀着红绒球的水手，还有杂七杂八的男子（他们大多数都头戴帽子，脖子上围着帕巾）；有半老徐娘，也有青春女子，一个个描眉涂唇（她们都没有戴帽子），下穿短裙，上穿五颜六色的罩衣。舞伴的搭配乱七八糟——有大男子和矮胖的小男孩跳（小男孩的眼睛化了妆），有身子干瘦、横眉立目的女人和染了头发的胖女人跳，也有男和女搭配跳。屋里弥漫着烟气、酒味和汗臭味。舞曲没完没了地奏着，人群散发着难闻的气味，在舞池里舞个不停，脸上的汗水闪着亮光，气氛严肃、紧张，有一些可怕的成分在里边。男客里有几个大块头，面相凶狠，但大多数男客都是矮个，显得营养不良。我看了看那三个乐手，觉得他们跟机器人一样，演奏起来死板板的。我怀疑他们是否在起步时怀揣过梦想，梦想着自己有朝一日会成为大音乐家，引得人们从大老远赶来听他们演奏，为他们喝彩。即便提琴拉得不好，也得请人教，也得练习呀！这位提琴手十年磨一剑，末了难道就是为了屈身于这么一个肮脏猪圈里，为人家拉狐步舞曲，一直拉到次日凌晨吗？后来，音乐停止了，钢琴手掏出一块脏手绢揩揩脸。跳舞的人纷纷返回自己的座位，或无精打采，或脚步踉跄，或身子歪斜。突然，我们耳边传来了一声美国口音的叫喊：

“我的老天呀！”

只见屋子另一头有个女子从一张桌子旁站了起来。和她在一起的那个男子想拦她，却被她一把推开，然后她就摇摇晃晃走了过来。她已经有八九分醉了，来到我们的桌前，站在那儿，脚下有点立不稳，傻里傻气咧嘴笑着。她似乎觉得我们这几个人很好笑似的。我偏头望了望我的同伴们。伊莎贝尔木然瞅着她；格雷一脸愠色；拉里目瞪口呆，仿佛无法相信自己的眼睛一般。

“你们好呀！”那女子说道。

“原来是索菲！”

“那你把我当成了哪一个了？”索菲咯咯一笑。她一把扯住了一个从身边走过的侍者，对他说道：“文森特，去给我拿把椅子来。”

“你自己拿去。”侍者挣开她的手说道。

“你个坏东西。[125]”她骂道，朝他啐了一口。

“别担心[126]，索菲，这儿有椅子。”一个油头粉面的大胖子喊了一声。那家伙坐在我们的邻桌，身上只穿了一件衬衣。

“想不到竟在此处碰上了你们诸位。”她说道，脚下仍站立不稳，“你好，拉里！你好，格雷！”她打着招呼，一屁股坐在了那个胖子放在她身后的一把椅子上，“来，咱们一起干一杯。老板！[127]”她扯着喉咙叫了一声。

我留意到那个老板一直在盯着我们，此时闻声走了过来。

“你认识这几个人，索菲？”他问道。他对索菲说话，用的是亲昵的单数第二人称。

“当然认识[128]，”她醉醺醺地大笑着说，“他们是我小时候的朋友。我要请他们喝一瓶香槟酒。你可不要给我们把马尿[129]拿来。拿酒来，别喝了叫我们呕吐。”

“你醉了，可怜的索菲。”老板说。

“咸吃萝卜淡操心。”

老板抽身走掉了，心里乐得卖掉了一瓶香槟酒。我们为了安全起见，只喝白兰地掺苏打水。索菲用呆滞的目光盯着我，把我打量了一会儿。

“伊莎贝尔，怎么不把你的这位朋友介绍一下？”

伊莎贝尔把我的名字告诉了她。

“啊，想起来了。你到芝加哥去过。看你的样子，很有派头呢，是不是？”

“也许吧。”我笑了笑说。

对于她，我却是一点也想不起来了，其实这也并不奇怪，因为去芝加哥是十多年前的事情了，当时及以后我又接触到了许许多多的人。

她的个子很高，站在那儿，由于瘦，就显得更高了。她上穿一件鲜绿的丝绸衣衫，皱巴巴的，上面满是污痕，下穿一条黑短裙，头发染成了亮亮的红褐色，剪得很短，马马虎虎盘了一下，乱得像鸡窝。她把自己打扮得妖里妖气，满脸都搽了胭脂，上下眼皮涂成了深蓝色，眉毛和睫毛上抹了浓浓的睫毛油，嘴唇用口红染成了血红色。她的手脏兮兮的，指甲盖上涂着指甲油。她一看就是个荡妇，比跟前的任何一个女人都显得下流。我怀疑她不仅喝醉了酒，还吸了毒。不过，无可否认的是，她身上有一股狐媚劲；她喜欢风情万种地把头扬得高高的，脸上的脂粉将绿眼珠子衬托得绿得惊人，尽管醉得厉害，却有一种厚颜无耻的荡劲，想象得来是颇受下流男人喜爱的。此时，只听她冲着我们冷笑了一声。

“看来，你们都不太高兴见到我。”她说道。

“听说你来巴黎了。”伊莎贝尔有气无力地说道，脸上浮出的笑容冷冰冰的。

“那你为什么不给我打电话。电话簿上有我的名字。”

“我们来的时间不长。”

格雷赶忙解围问道：

“你来这儿过得好吗，索菲？”

“还好。你破产了，格雷，是不是？”

格雷一听，脸红得跟猪肝一样。

“是的。”

“够你呛的。芝加哥那边恐怕日子都不好过。幸亏我逃了出来。上帝呀，那个天杀的怎么还没有把酒送来？”

“正朝这边走呢。”我瞧见一个侍者手举托盘，上面放着酒杯和一瓶酒，正顺着桌子间的甬道走过来，于是便这样说道。

我的话把她的注意力吸引到了我身上。

“我那慈爱的婆家人把我踢出了芝加哥，说我败坏了他们家的名声。”她说完咯咯一笑，笑得野里野气，“现在我是靠汇款过日子。”

香槟酒送来后，倒进了杯子里。她哆嗦着手端起酒杯，把酒杯举至唇边。

“那些势利小人，去他们的吧。”她说完一仰脖子喝光了杯中的酒，然后望了拉里一眼。“你好像肚子里没有多少话要说的，拉里。”

拉里一直在观察着她，脸上一点表情也没有。自从她露面，他的眼睛一刻也没离开过她。此时听了她的话，他便冲她莞尔一笑。

“我本来话就不多么。”他说。

乐手们又奏起了音乐。一个家伙朝我们这边走了过来，他个子比较高，长得虎背熊腰，大鹰钩鼻，头发油黑发亮，嘴唇厚墩墩的，面容有点像“恶人”萨伏那罗拉[130]。跟屋里的大多数男人一样，他没有戴衣领，上衣的扣子扣得紧紧的，显出他的腰身来。

“来呀，索菲，咱们跳舞去。”

“走开。我忙着呢。你没看见我和朋友在说话吗？”

“我才不管你的什么朋友不朋友呢。[131]叫你的朋友见鬼去吧。你跟我跳舞去。”

他说着一把抓住了索菲的胳膊，却被索菲甩开了。

“松开我，你这个浑蛋！[132]”她勃然大怒，吼了起来。

“妈的。[133]”

“王八蛋。[134]”

格雷听不懂他们的话，但我看出伊莎贝尔却完全能理解他们的意思——奇怪的是，大多数讲究道德修养的女子对污言秽语很敏感，一听就懂。这时，只见她沉下脸来，蛾眉紧蹙，显出一副厌恶的表情。那人举起胳臂，张开他那只长满老茧的工人的手，眼看就要扇在索菲的脸上。就在这时，格雷从椅子上半抬起身子，恶声恶气地大吼一声：

“还不快滚！[135]”

那人住了手，气哼哼地瞥了格雷一眼。

“小心点，可可，”索菲奸笑了一声说，“他会要你的命的。”

那人看了看格雷的个头和体重，看得出他力大无穷，悻悻地耸耸肩膀，冲我们骂了一句脏话，灰溜溜地跑了。索菲醉醺醺地咯咯笑个不停。大家谁都没有说话。我又给她的杯子斟满了酒。

“你住在巴黎吗，拉里？”她喝干杯中的酒，问道。

“只是暂时的。”

跟一个喝醉酒的人说话一般是很吃力的。毫无疑问，没喝酒的与喝醉酒的交谈，总是谈不拢。我们跟索菲说了一会儿话，气氛别别扭扭，很是尴尬。后来，索菲把椅子向后一推，说道：

“我再不回到我的男朋友那儿去，他会气疯的。那是个爱生气的混球。不过，感谢上帝，他床上的功夫很棒。”她说着，摇摇晃晃站了起来，“再见，老乡们。欢迎再来。我每天晚上都在这儿呢。”

她挤进跳舞的人群，然后就消失了。伊莎贝尔那典雅的脸上冷若冰霜，挂着蔑视的表情，我看了差点没笑出声来。有半晌儿，大家谁都没有说话。

“这是个藏污纳垢的地方，”伊莎贝尔突然蹦出了这么一句，“咱们走吧。”

我付了酒水钱，也为索菲的那瓶香槟酒埋了单。随后，我们鱼贯走出咖啡馆。人们仍在舞池里跳个不停，我们却看也不看便离开了。时间已过两点，我觉得应当睡觉了，可格雷说他肚子饿，于是，我建议到蒙马特高地的格拉芙餐馆去吃点东西。汽车启动时，大家都默默无语的。我坐在格雷身旁为他指路，一直把车开到了那家富丽堂皇的餐馆。餐馆的露台上还坐有顾客。我们进了门，要了鸡蛋、火腿和啤酒。至少从表面看，伊莎贝尔已经恢复了平静。她用一种夹枪带棒的口气对我表示祝贺，祝贺我竟然和巴黎那些乌七八糟的地方有来往。

“是你自己提出来要去的。”我抢白道。

“反正我玩得倒是十分开心的，度过了一个美妙的夜晚。”

“糟透了，”格雷说，“想起来就叫人恶心。索菲也真够可怜的。”

伊莎贝尔不置可否地耸了耸肩。

“你能想起来她吗？”她问我，“你第一次到我们家吃晚饭时，她就坐在你身旁。那个时候，她的头发是原色，即浅棕色，没有染成现在这种可怕的红颜色。”

我回想了一下当时的情景，记起了一个年龄不大的小女孩，一双蓝眼睛带点绿色，说话时把脑袋一偏，挺招人喜欢的。她并不漂亮，但活泼、坦率，同时带几分腼腆和唐突，让人觉得很有意思。

“当然能想起来。我当时就喜欢她的名字，因为我有个姑妈也叫索菲。”

“她嫁了一个叫鲍勃·麦克唐纳的小伙子。”

“那小伙子挺不错的。”格雷说道。

“在我见过的极为英俊的小伙子里面，他算其中的一个。我简直不明白他看上了索菲的哪一点。我刚结婚，她也结了婚。她的父母离异，母亲改嫁给了一个在中国工作的美孚石油公司的人。她随父亲一家住在马文，我们经常见面。不过，她结婚之后，便淡出了我们的朋友圈。鲍勃·麦克唐纳是个律师，挣钱却不多。他们住在北区的一座没有电梯的公寓楼里。不过，这也没什么。他们相亲相爱，那种热乎劲真是少见。即便结婚已经有两三年而且生了一个孩子之后，他们上电影院时，还是像一对情侣——他搂着她的腰，而她把头靠在他的肩上。他们一时成了芝加哥谈笑的话题。”

拉里听伊莎贝尔说话，中间未置一词，脸上带着一种叫人捉摸不透的表情。

“后来怎么啦？”我问。

“一天晚间，他们开着自家的敞篷汽车返回芝加哥，孩子也和他们在一起。他们出去总把孩子带上，因为家里没人帮他们照料。反正索菲干什么事都自己来。再说他们也片刻离不开孩子。有几个醉鬼开着一辆大轿车，以每小时八十英里的速度和他们的车迎头相撞。鲍勃和孩子当场死于非命。索菲被撞成了脑震荡，还断了一两根肋骨。大家千方百计瞒着她，不让她知道鲍勃和孩子已经死了。瞒到最后，也只好将实情告诉了她。据说，当时的情景可怕极了。她差点没发疯，哭天喊地，声音能把房子都震塌。不分白天和黑夜，都有人看着她——有一次，她差点跳楼自杀。我们能做的全都做了，但她好像恨上了我们。出了医院之后，又把她送进了疗养院，在那儿疗养了几个月。”

“是个可怜的人呀。”

“一旦放松了监管，她就开始酗酒，喝醉了，谁要她，她就跟谁睡觉。她夫家的人身陷窘境。他们都是些老老实实的本分人，十分痛恨她的丑闻陋行。起初，我们还想帮她一把，但无济于事。你请她吃饭，她来时就已经喝得醉醺醺的了，不等散席便不省人事了。后来，她跟一些不三不四的人交往，我们只好和她一刀两断了。一次，她因醉驾而被捕。车上还有一个人，是她随便勾搭上的一个混混，结果发现此人是警方通缉的逃犯。”

“她靠什么生活呀？”我问。

“有鲍勃的人寿保险呢。和他们撞车的那辆车的车主上了保险，她获得了一些赔偿。但那点钱没多久便花光了。她挥霍无度，花钱如流水，不出两年就一贫如洗了。她的祖母不肯让她回马文去。她夫家的人说，如果她到国外定居，就给她寄生活费。我想，她现在就是靠这笔钱过日子呢。”

“这可真是命运的大轮回呀。”我说道，“想当初，我们国家把害群之马流放到美国去，而今你们美国则将害群之马送到欧洲来了。”

“我真是为索菲感到惋惜呀。”格雷说。

“是吗？”伊莎贝尔冷静地说，“我却不这么想。当然，那是一次沉重的打击。按说，我比任何人都同情索菲。我们俩可是知根知底的。不过，一个正常人总是能够恢复过来的。她一蹶不振，只是因为她有这方面的劣根性。她在本性上是不健全的。就连她对鲍勃的爱情都超过了正常的范围。假如她性格坚强，便可以重新爬起来，继续生活下去。”

“人和人是不同的……你是不是太严苛了些，伊莎贝尔？”我咕哝了一句。

“恐怕并非如此。我觉得应该保持理智，在看待索菲这件事上实在不应该感情用事。上帝知道，谁也没有我对格雷及两个孩子的感情深，如果他们死于车祸，我会发疯的，但迟早会重新振作起来。格雷，你是愿意让我重新振作起来，还是愿意叫我夜夜喝个大醉，然后随便跟巴黎的哪个混混上床睡觉？”

格雷的回答很妙，可以说是我听到他所说的最幽默的一段话：

“当然，我倒愿意让你穿一件莫利纽克斯服装店的衣服跳进我的火葬堆陪葬，只是现在不准这样做了。所以，我想你最好的出路就是打桥牌了。请你一定要记住：不要急于求成，不要一开始就出王牌，而应该等到手中有三叠半到四叠牌再说。”

此时不是时候，我不便向伊莎贝尔指出她对丈夫和孩子们的爱是诚挚的，但并不怎么热烈。也许，她看出了我心里在想什么，于是略带挑战意味地问我：

“你是怎么看的？”

“和格雷一样，我为那女孩子感到惋惜。”

“她不是女孩子了，都三十岁的人了。”

“我想她的丈夫和孩子一死，就等于是世界末日的来临。至于她自己会有什么样的结果，她已完全不在乎了，于是便陷入堕落的泥潭，酗酒和淫乱。她认为命运之神对她过于残酷，于是便借此进行报复。她本来住在天堂，现在天堂失去了，却又住不惯平凡人的平凡世界，因此，绝望之余，一头钻进了地狱。可以想象得来，既然再也喝不上天界的琼浆玉液，那她情愿喝厕所里的小便。”

“这是你们作家在小说里讲的一套大道理。完全是无稽之谈，是瞎胡扯。索菲陷入泥潭，那是因为她喜欢那儿。丧夫丧子的大有人在，谁也不像她。并非一次事故就会叫人变坏；坏并不是由好变过来的，而是本身就存在。车祸冲破了她的防线，于是她就露出了本性。你可不要怜香惜玉，浪费你的感情，她现在这个样子，其实就是她的本来面目。”

在这段时间里，拉里一句话也没说。他似乎在思考着什么，我们的话恐怕并没有听进耳朵里去。伊莎贝尔说完话，一时谁都没有再吭声。后来，拉里开了口，声音古怪、单调，不像是对我们说话，而像自言自语，目光仿佛飘向了如烟似雾般过去的岁月。

“记得她十四岁的时候留着长发，头发从额头朝后梳，在后面打一个黑蝴蝶结，脸上有雀斑，表情沉稳。那时，她是个谦虚、高尚、充满理想的孩子，什么书都喜欢看。我们经常在一起谈诗论文。”

“什么时候呀？”伊莎贝尔把眉头微微一皱，问道。

“哦，就是你和你的母亲出外从事社交活动的时候。我常到她祖父家，我们就坐在他们家的大榆树下读书，有时我给她念，有时她给我念。她喜欢诗歌，写了许多诗呢。”

“那个年龄的女孩子都喜欢写写诗，都是些蹩脚的歪诗。”

“当然，那是许久以前的事了。那时候，我不太懂诗，看不出来优劣。”

“那时候，你顶多也只有十六岁。”

“当然喽，她的诗都是模拟之作，许多地方学的是罗勃特·弗罗斯特[136]。不过，我觉得那么小的孩子能把诗写成那样，相当了不起。她心思细密，写出的诗很有节奏感。乡间的声音和气息——早春柔和的芳香以及干旱土地在雨后散发出的气味，都能引起她的共鸣。”

“我从来不知道她在写诗。”伊莎贝尔说。

“她守口如瓶，生怕你们会取笑她。她比较害羞。”

“她现在可不害臊了。”

“我从战场上归来时，她几乎已长成个大人了。关于工人阶级的生存状况，她读了许多这方面的书，在芝加哥也有所耳闻目睹。她痴迷于卡尔·桑德堡[137]的诗，自己也拼命写自由体的诗，反映穷苦人水深火热的生活以及工人阶级受剥削的情况。依我看，她的诗平淡无奇，然而却感情真挚，满怀同情之心，充满了热忱。那时，她想当一个社会工作者。她那种对公益事业的献身精神让人感动。我觉得她很有能力，头脑一点不糊涂，遇到问题不是感情用事，而给人一种纯洁可爱、心灵高尚的印象。那一年里，我们经常见面。”

可以看得出，伊莎贝尔越听越恼怒。拉里全然不知自己在拿刀子捅她的心窝，每说一句话，就像是用刀子在她的伤口上搅动了一下。不过，轮到伊莎贝尔说话的时候，她的嘴角却挂着笑容。

“她怎么会选中你，对你推心置腹呢？”

拉里用坦荡的目光望了望她。

“我也不清楚。你们都是有钱人，而她家很穷，我和她都不属于你们那个阶层。我到马文去，只是因为纳尔逊叔叔在那儿行医。也许，她觉得我们俩在这方面有共同之处吧。”

拉里举目无亲。一般人都有些堂兄堂妹什么的，虽然并不熟悉，却至少有一种感觉，觉得自己是一个家族的成员。拉里的父亲是独生子，母亲是独生女；他的祖父是教友派教徒，年纪很轻时就在海上遇难，他的外祖父没有兄弟，也没有姐妹。在这个世界上，恐怕数拉里最为孤单了。

“索菲爱你，这些你可曾想到过吗？”伊莎贝尔问。

“从没想到过。”拉里笑了笑说。

“哦，她是爱你的。”

“拉里是战场上负了伤的英雄，当年返回故乡时，半个芝加哥的女孩子都迷上了他。”格雷以他那种坦率的语气说。

“索菲不仅仅是迷恋，还崇拜你。可怜的拉里，她的感情你难道一无所知吗？”

“我当然不知道。我也不相信。”

“也许，你把她想得太高尚了。”

“我仿佛仍能看见那个瘦瘦的小女孩，头发上扎了个蝴蝶结，表情严肃，读起济慈的颂歌来，声音有点发抖，眼里涌出泪水来，因为济慈的诗写得太美了。真不知那个小女孩今在何方。”

伊莎贝尔微微吃了一惊，带着迷惑不解的神情把拉里看了一眼。

“时间太晚了。我累得都不知道怎么样才好了。咱们走吧。”

第二天傍晚，我搭乘蓝色列车[138]去了里维埃拉，两三天后前往安提比斯去看望艾略特，把巴黎的新闻告诉了他。他看上去气色很糟，蒙特卡蒂尼的疗养并没有取得预期的疗效，而事后去各处旅行又弄得他精疲力竭。他在威尼斯找到一只圣洗池，然后又到佛罗伦萨去买下那幅经过讨价还价才敲定的三联浮雕画。他急于把这些东西安装在教堂里，便跑到了蓬蒂内沼泽去，下榻于一家条件很差的客栈，屋里热得令人无法忍受。他买的那些宝贝东西要很长时间才能到货，但他下定决心不达目的誓不离开，于是就坚持了下来。最后，一切料理停当，他对效果极为满意。见了我，他就自豪地把拍的照片拿给我看。教堂虽然小，但很有气派，内部装修富于情调，对艾略特高雅的艺术品味是一种佐证。

“我到罗马时，看见一具早期基督教时期的石棺，不由动了心，考虑了好久，想把它买下来，但最后想了想，还是放弃了。”

“你怎么会想到要买一口早期基督教时期的石棺呢，艾略特？”

“是给我自己用的，亲爱的老伙计。这具石棺极为精美，可以和门道另一侧的圣洗池配成一双。不过，早期的基督徒都是些矮胖子，他们的石棺装不下我。我可不愿在最后审判日的号声吹响时，膝盖顶着下巴躺在里面，像个胎儿一样。那种姿势太不舒服了。”

我被逗笑了，而艾略特却是一本正经的。

“我想出了一个比较好的办法，并做出了具体安排，中间遇到了一些困难，但这也是在意料之中的。我死后要葬在祭坛前边的台阶跟前。这样，蓬蒂内沼泽的那些可怜的农民前来领圣餐时，会穿着沉重的皮靴踏着我的遗骨走过去。你不觉得这样很酷吗？那儿只放一块普通的石板，上面刻有我的名字和生卒年月。还刻有Si monumentum quoeris, circumspiece[139]，意思“我懂拉丁语，知道这句被人们广泛引用的铭文是什么意思，用不着你翻译，艾略特。”我有点刻薄地说。

“对不起，老伙计。我惯常跟愚昧无知的上流社会的人打交道，一时竟忘了这是在跟一位作家说话。”

他嘴上不饶人，呛了我这么一句。

“有件事情我想对你讲一讲。”他继续说道，“对于身后之事，我已在遗嘱里写明，只是希望你能监督执行。我可不愿葬在里维埃拉，和那些退役上校以及法国的中产阶级埋在一起。”

“我当然会按你的意愿办理，艾略特。不过，我认为那是多年以后的事了，用不着现在就制订计划。”

“你知道，我也是上了岁数的人了。说实在话，离开人世，我并不为之感到难过。兰多[140]的那几句诗是怎么说的来着？我双手烤着火……”

我对诗文的记性虽则很差，但是，这首诗很短，所以我能背得出来：

我与世无争，和谁争我都不愿；

我爱艺术，仅次于我爱大自然；

我双手烤着火，用生命之火取暖；

火渐熄，我已做好了走的打算。

“是这几句诗。”他说。

我不由心想，艾略特真是想入非非，竟拿这几句诗形容自己的状况，实在牵强。

“这首诗淋漓尽致地表达了我的心情。”却听他这样继续说道，“唯有一点我需要补充进去，那就是我终生与欧洲的上流社会打交道。”

“在一首这么短的四行诗里，把你的人生经历加进去恐怕是件棘手的事。”

“社交界已走进了死胡同。我曾经满怀憧憬，希望美国能取代欧洲的位置，创造一个万民敬仰的贵族阶层，谁料经济大萧条将此化为一场空梦。我不幸的祖国越来越叫人失望，成为一个极其平庸的国度。我说出来你也不会相信，老伙计，上次去美国，一个出租车司机竟然称我为‘兄弟’。”[141]

受到一九二九年经济大崩溃的冲击，里维埃拉已好景不再，仍然没有恢复过来。艾略特却依然如故，照旧举办宴会，并参加别人举办的宴会。他从不跟犹太人你来我往，不过对罗慈吉尔兹家族却是个例外。话又说回来，最为盛大的宴会往往正是这些上帝选中的人举办的。而只要有宴会，艾略特心里就发痒，不得不去。他穿梭于这些聚会，优雅地握握这位先生的手，或者吻吻那位女士的手，表情却忧郁、超然，就像是一个流亡皇族混杂于平民，颇觉尴尬。而那些真正的流亡皇族却审时度势，将结识电影明星视为崇高的愿望。眼下有一种风气，将演艺界的人纳入了社交圈子，艾略特对此是看不顺眼的。可是，一位隐退的女演员在离他家很近的地方建了一座豪宅，敞开门接待四方来宾，内阁部长、公爵、阔太太富小姐在她府上一住就是几个星期，艾略特也成了她的座上宾。

“当然，她的客人形形色色，什么人都有。”他告诉我说，“不过，那些人你不愿意跟他们说话，可以不予理睬。再怎么她也是我的同胞嘛，我觉得自己有义务伸出援手。住在她家的那些法国客人，看见一个会说法语的，心里一定会放松不少。”

有时候看得很明显，他的身体十分不好。我劝他不要把社交活动看得太重。

“老伙计，我这种年龄，只能进不能退。我在上流社会混了快五十年了，此处的道理我哪能不知——你不露面，别人就会把你忘掉。”

真不知他明不明白自己的这一番表白是多么可悲。我都没有心情再去取笑他了，觉得他是一个彻头彻尾的可怜虫。他活着就是为了从事社交活动，而宴会则是他的生命支柱。不邀请他，就是对他的侮辱，无人理睬会叫他丢面子；现在上了年纪，他最怕的就是受冷落。

夏天一溜而过。艾略特在里维埃拉从这头跑到那头，疲于奔命，在戛纳吃午饭，又跑到蒙特卡洛吃晚饭，忽而茶会，忽而鸡尾酒会，使出浑身解数应付场面，不管有多累，他都会强打起精神，装出一副和蔼、健谈和风趣的样子。他知道许多小道消息，对于最近发生的丑闻，除了当事人，恐怕数他了解得最清楚了。假如你向他指出这样的生活毫无价值，他一定会呆呆地望着你，满脸的惊愕，觉得你简直就是个令人扫兴的蠢蛋。





四


秋天来临，艾略特决定到巴黎小住一段时间，一方面是去看看伊莎贝尔、格雷和两个孩子过得怎样，一方面则是为了他所说的“回首都重温旧梦[142]”。之后，他打算到伦敦去定做几件新衣服，再顺便探望一下几个老友。我原计划直接去伦敦，但他邀我和他一同开车到巴黎去。这样的安排挺不错的，所以我就同意了。既然如此，我觉得自己不妨也在巴黎小住一下，起码待上几天总是可以的。这一趟旅途轻轻松松，遇见好的餐馆就停下来又吃又喝的。艾略特肾功能不好，不敢喝酒，只喝维奇矿泉水，但他每次都坚持要亲自选半瓶葡萄酒让我喝。他心眼好，自己虽然不能品尝美酒佳酿，可是见我喝得快活，他也感到由衷的高兴。他非常慷慨，我要费许多口舌才能说服他允许我清付我的那一份开销。他津津乐道于他过去认识的那些大人物，听得我有些心烦，但这趟旅行还是令人开心的。穿行于乡间，初秋的景色美不胜收，叫人心旷神怡。在枫丹白露吃过午饭，下午时分才抵达巴黎。把我送到我所下榻的那家普普通通的老式旅馆，他便驱车绕过街角去里茨饭店了。我们提前通知过伊莎贝尔，说我们要来巴黎，所以见到她留在旅馆里的便条，我并不感到惊讶，叫我觉得惊讶的是便条上写的内容：

见条后速来。出大事了。别把艾略特舅舅带来。看在上帝的分上，快来吧！

我的好奇心之强烈不亚于任何人，但我总得先洗洗，换上件干净衣服呀。整理完毕，我就搭上一辆出租车到圣纪尧姆大街的那幢公寓楼去了。抵达后，我被引进了客厅里。伊莎贝尔见了我，立刻跳起来。

“你这是到哪儿去了？我都等你几个小时了。”

此时是下午五点钟。我还没有来得及回答，管家就把茶具送了来。伊莎贝尔双手紧握在一起，不耐烦地看着管家摆茶具。我想象不出究竟出了什么事。

“我们刚到，中途在枫丹白露吃了顿午饭，耽搁了一下。”

“上帝呀，摆个东西怎么这么慢！快把人急疯了。”伊莎贝尔说。

管家先将托盘连同茶壶放在桌子上，然后摆上糖缸和茶杯，再把一盘盘的面包、黄油、蛋糕、甜饼放在旁边，动作慢悠悠的，的确叫人着恼。做完这一切，他走出客厅，随手关上了门。

“拉里要跟索菲·麦克唐纳结婚了。”

“索菲·麦克唐纳是谁？”

“别装蒜了！”伊莎贝尔大叫一声，眼里喷射出怒火来，“就是你带我们去的那家肮脏咖啡馆里碰见的那个喝醉酒的荡妇。天知道你为什么把我们带到那种地方去。那一趟叫格雷恶心透了。”

“哦，你指的是你们那个芝加哥的朋友吧？”我没理会她的不公正责备，这样问道，“你怎么知道他们要结婚？”

“我怎么知道？拉里昨天下午跑来，是他亲口告诉我的。我都快气疯了。”

“你不妨坐下来，给我倒杯茶，慢慢讲给我听。”

“茶还是你自己倒吧。”

她一屁股坐到茶桌旁，气哼哼地看着我倒茶。倒完茶，我舒舒服服地坐在了壁炉跟前的一张小沙发上。

最近不常见他——我指的是从迪纳尔返回之后。他去迪纳尔待了几天，不肯跟我们住在一起，而是下榻于一家旅馆。那几天，他常到海滩上陪孩子们玩。孩子们十分喜欢他。我们还曾经到圣布里亚克打过高尔夫球。一天，格雷问他再见到过索菲没有。

‘见过，见过好几次呢。’他回答说。

‘为什么要见她？’我问。

‘她是个老朋友嘛。’他说。

‘我要是你，就决不会在她身上浪费时间。’我说。

他听了微微一笑。你知道他是怎么笑的，就好像你说的话很滑稽一样（其实一点也不滑稽）。

‘可是，你不是我呀。’他说。

我当时耸了耸肩膀，转到别的话题上了。之后再也没有多想过。当他跑来告诉我，说他们打算结婚时，你可以想象得出我有多么震惊。

‘你不能跟她结婚，拉里。’我说道，‘你不能这样做。’

‘我已经决定了。’他说道，那股若无其事的劲儿，就像是在点菜，吩咐再来一份炒土豆一样，‘我想让你对她好一些，伊莎贝尔。’

“‘这个要求太过分了。’我说道，‘你发疯了。她是个坏女人，非常坏。’”

“你怎么会这么想？”我打断她的话说道。

伊莎贝尔望着我，眼睛里直冒火。

“她从早到晚喝得烂醉。不管谁让她陪睡，她就跟人家上床。”

“这并不能说明她就是坏人。不少受人尊敬的人也喜欢酗酒，喜欢干一些下流的事情。这是坏习惯，就跟有人喜欢咬指甲一样。我就不知道这样的人能坏到哪儿去。我觉得只有那些坑蒙拐骗、丧尽天良的人才是坏人。”

“你要是一味偏袒她，看我不收拾你。”

“拉里是怎么又和她见的面？”

“他在电话簿上找到她的住址，便跑去看她。她正在生病——这也难怪，她那样糟践自己，哪能不病。他为她请医生，并安排人伺候她。他们就这样来往起来。拉里说她戒了酒。这个笨蛋竟然认为他把她给治好了。”

“你忘了拉里给格雷治病的事了吗？难道不是他把格雷的病治好了吗？”

“那是两码事。格雷渴望被治好，而她没有这个意愿。”

“你怎么知道她没有？”

“因为我了解女人。一个女人堕落到那种地步，就会破罐子破摔，是决不愿走回头路的。索菲今日的堕落，完全是本性使然。你以为她会对拉里忠贞不渝吗？当然不会。迟早有一天她会跟拉里分手。这是由她的本性决定的。她喜欢的是流氓，因为这让她感到刺激，所以她非流氓不要。她会把拉里置于水深火热之中。”

“这种情况很有可能会出现。不过，咱们也只能干瞪眼，爱莫能助。他这是明知山有虎偏向虎山行呀。”

“我是爱莫能助，你却可以帮助他。”

“我？”

“拉里喜欢你，听你的话。只有你能够对他施加影响。你见过世面，不妨去劝劝他，让他不要做傻事，免得毁掉自己的生活。”

“他会叫我少管闲事——他如此说不无道理。”

“可是，你喜欢他呀，至少可以说对他感兴趣呀，总不能袖手旁观，眼睁睁看着他一步步走进泥潭。”

“格雷是他的老朋友，和他的关系最铁。我认为劝说是劝不动的，但如果要劝，格雷恐怕也是最合适的人选。”

“哼，格雷！”她不耐烦地哼了声鼻子。

“话又说回来，事情也不一定像你想的那样一团糟。我认识两三个人——一个是在西班牙，两个是在东方，他们娶了妓女当老婆，小日子过得挺好。那些女子对丈夫感激涕零，因为丈夫给她们提供了一个安乐窝。她们投桃报李，给丈夫带来了那方面的欢乐。”

“你的话叫人听了心烦。你以为我牺牲了自己的利益，就是为了让拉里落入一个不知廉耻的荡妇手中？”

“你是怎样牺牲自己利益的？”

“我放弃拉里只为了一个原因，那就是我不想影响他的前途。”

“得了吧，伊莎贝尔。你放弃他是为了方形钻戒和貂皮大衣。”

我的话刚出口，就有一盘面包和黄油朝着我的脑袋飞了过来。纯粹凭运气，我一把接住了盘子，面包和黄油却啪嗒落在了地板上。我站起身，将盘子放回到桌子上。

“你把艾略特舅舅的皇冠德贝瓷盘[143]打破一只，他可不会饶你的。这些瓷盘当初是特为第三代多塞特公爵烧制的，几乎是无价之宝。”

“把黄油和面包捡起来！”她怒气冲冲地说。

“要捡你自己捡。”我说完又坐回到了沙发上。

她站了起来，一边生着闷气，一边弯腰捡散落了一地的面包和黄油。

“你还自称是英国绅士呢。”她愤怒地嚷嚷道。

“错了，我可从来没有这么称呼过自己。”

“快从这里滚出去。我再也不想见到你了。看见你就叫我讨厌。”

“这太令人遗憾了。我倒是一直都很喜欢见你。不知是否有人告诉过你，你的鼻子跟那不勒斯博物馆里塞姬[144]石像的鼻子一模一样。这座石像是存世的代表少女美的最优秀作品。你的腿非常优美，修长匀称，我见了总是不由得感到惊奇——你当姑娘的时候，两条腿粗壮粗壮的，简直想象不来怎么变得这么漂亮。”

“靠的是坚强的意志和上帝的恩泽。”她怒气冲冲地说。

“不过，要说迷人，还是你的手最迷人了，那么纤细，那么典雅。”

“我有个印象，好像你觉得我的手太大了。”

“就你这样的个头和身段来说，这双手不算大。你的手运作起来，简直优雅极了，令人不胜赞叹。不管是有意还是无意，你的手一举一动都有一种美感。它们有时候像鲜花绽放，有时候似飞鸟展翅，比任何语言都更富于表现力，很像埃尔·格列柯[145]肖像画里主人公的手。实际上，艾略特曾说你家祖上有个人是西班牙贵族，我原来不信，可是看到你的手我就相信了。”

她气恼地瞥了我一眼。

“你在胡扯些什么呀？这我还是第一次听说。”

我把劳里亚伯爵娶玛丽王后侍女的事给她讲了一遍，说那就是艾略特母系一族的先祖。伊莎贝尔一面听，一面自豪地端详着自己的长手指和修剪涂染过的指甲。

“一个人总得有先祖的。”她说完，扑哧一笑，顽皮地看了我一眼，目光里完全没有了怨气。之后，她又娇嗔地说：“你真坏！”

对于女人，只要说话说得得当，很容易叫她明白事理。

“有些时候，我并不是真的讨厌你。”她说道。

随后，她走过来坐到我身旁，挽起我的胳膊，探过身子就要吻我。我急忙将脸扭开。

“我可不愿让脸颊沾上口红。”我说道，“要吻你就吻我的嘴唇吧，这是仁慈的上帝让人们接吻的地方。”

她咯咯笑了几声，然后把我的脸扳过来，将芳唇印在我的嘴唇上，留下了一道细细的口红的痕印。我感觉美滋滋的。

“好啦，心意领了。现在说说你想让我做什么吧。”

“想听听你的锦囊妙计。”

“我十分愿意效力，只怕你一时听不进去。只有一条锦囊妙计献给你：顺其自然。”

她听了又火冒三丈，蹭地将胳膊抽回去，站起身，跑到壁炉的另一侧，一屁股坐回了椅子上。

“我可不能袖手旁观，眼睁睁看着拉里毁掉自己。我要做出一切努力阻止他和那个荡妇结婚。”

“你不会成功的。你可以看到，他已经被感情迷了心窍，而那种感情是人类胸腔里最炽热的感情。”

“你不会是说他爱上她了吧？”

“不是那意思。与这种感情相比，爱情便微不足道了。”

“此话怎讲？”

“你读过《新约全书》没有？”

“读过一些吧。”

“基督曾经受到诱惑走进旷野，一连四十天没有吃饭的故事你还记得吗？就在他饥饿难忍的时候，魔鬼来到他跟前说：‘如果你真是上帝之子，那你不妨将这些石头变为面包。’可是基督顶住了诱惑。接下来，魔鬼把他放在圣殿的屋顶上对他说：‘如果你真是上帝之子，那你不妨从这儿跳下去。有天使的保护，会把你托起来的。’而基督又一次顶住了诱惑。随即，魔鬼把他带到了一座高山上，把世界上的各个王国指给他看，说如果基督愿意跪下来参拜他，就把那些国家赐给基督号令。可是基督正色说道：‘滚开吧，撒旦！’根据善良、单纯的马太的记载，故事的结尾就是这样。实际上，故事并没有结束。魔鬼很狡猾，他又来找基督，对他说：如果你愿意接受羞辱、鞭打，愿意戴上荆棘编的帽冠，最后被钉死在十字架上，那你便可以解救全人类，因为为了朋友牺牲自己的生命，是人所能表现出的最伟大的爱。这次，基督中计了。魔鬼笑得肚子都痛了，因为他知道坏人会假借为人类赎罪的名义来干坏事的。”

伊莎贝尔愠怒地望着我。

“你这段故事到底出自于何处？”

“就出自于这儿。是我临时编出来的。”

“我觉得这故事荒唐、亵渎神明。”

“我只是想向你指出，自我牺牲是压倒一切的情感，连淫欲和饥饿跟它相比都会显得微不足道。它最大程度地使人格高尚化，诱惑人走向毁灭。它无视目的，不管值得不值得它都会这样做。没有一种美酒能令人如此陶醉，没有一种爱情能使人如此心碎，没有一种罪恶能叫人如此无法抵御。一个人一旦牺牲掉自己，顷刻就会变得比上帝还伟大，因为上帝是无限和万能的，怎么能牺牲自己呢？上帝顶多只能牺牲自己唯一的儿子。”

“哎，老天爷，这话说得太乏味了。”伊莎贝尔说道。

我没理会她，继续说了下去：

“拉里目前就是被这种情感左右着。此时对他晓之以理动之以情，你想会有什么效果吗？这些年他在追求什么，你一无所知，我也不知道，只能猜出个一二来。多年的辛勤劳作，多年的经验积累，如果放在天平上与他的愿望相权衡，就轻多了。那不仅仅是愿望，更是一种迫切、热烈的驱动力，要去挽救一个他认识的女人的灵魂——那女人从前是个清纯的孩子，而今成了荡妇。我觉得你言之有理——他一定会无果而终。他过于注重情感，势必会遭受种种磨难。不管他有什么样的事业，什么样的追求，都将功亏一篑。卑鄙的帕里斯一箭射中阿喀琉斯的脚后跟，使他送了命。[146]拉里缺乏的正是这种狠毒劲——即便是圣徒，如欲修得正果，也得有这种狠劲。”

“我爱他。”伊莎贝尔说道，“上帝知道，我对他无所求，无所图。谁都不可能像我这般无私地爱他。我不愿让他的生活过得不幸福。”

说完，她嘤嘤哭了起来。我觉得哭哭对她有好处，所以没加劝阻。在百无聊赖之际，我的心里突然蹿出了一种想法，于是便琢磨、回味起来。我敢断言，看到基督教发动残酷无情的战争，看到基督徒相互迫害、摧残，看到人世间的凶残暴虐、尔虞我诈及鸡肠小肚，魔鬼考虑一下自己的收获，一定会心满意足的；想到基督教给人类背上了一个原始罪恶的痛苦包袱，使美丽的星空黯然失色，在世人及时行乐的心坎上投下了一道邪恶的阴影，魔鬼一定会开心地笑出声，悄然低语说：这就是报应。

伊莎贝尔哭了一会儿，然后从提包里取出一块手帕和一个小镜子，一边照镜子，一边小心翼翼地擦掉眼角的泪水。

“你就没有一点同情之心吗？”她气愤地问。

我若有所思地望着她，却没有回答她的话。她在脸上扑扑粉，在嘴唇上涂了点口红。

“你刚才说猜出了几分他这些年的追求。此话怎讲？”

“只不过是瞎猜罢了，很可能是错的。我觉得他在寻求一种哲学，也可能是一种宗教，一种可以使他身心都获得安宁的人生准则。”

伊莎贝尔沉吟片刻，然后叹了口气说：

“一个伊利诺伊州马文镇的乡下孩子会有这样的想法，你不觉得奇怪吗？”

“卢瑟·伯班克[147]出生在马萨诸塞州的农场，培植出了无核的橘子，亨利·福特[148]出生在密歇根州的农场，却发明了小汽车，与他们相比，拉里就不显得奇怪了。”

“但那两人经营的是实业，符合美国的传统。”

我听了哈哈大笑。

“天下还有什么比学会有意义地生活更能称得上是实业呢？”

伊莎贝尔有气无力地摆了一下手。

“你不想完全失去拉里，对不对？”

她点头称是。

“你知道拉里是个重情感的人。你不愿跟他的妻子来往，他也会跟你井水不犯河水。假如你不痴不傻，倒不如和索菲交朋友。你必须不计前嫌，尽可能善待她。她即将结婚，恐怕得买些衣服。你何不提出跟她一起去采购？我想她肯定会高兴死的。”

伊莎贝尔眯着眼在听我讲话，好像听得十分专注，一面在想着心事。我猜不出她心里在转什么念头。接下来，她的几句话令我颇觉意外。

“能不能由你出面请她吃午饭？昨天我对拉里说了那样难听的话，再让我请，怪不好意思的。”

“如果我请，你能注意自己的言行吗？”

“我会像个光明天使一样。”她说着，绽出了极为迷人的微笑。

“我这就把此事定下来。”

客厅里有电话。我很快就查到了索菲的号码。凡是拨打法国的电话，都要耐着性子等一会儿才能接通。对方总算拿起了听筒，我通报了自己的姓名。

“我刚到巴黎，”我说，“听说你跟拉里要结婚了。我想对你表示祝贺，希望你们幸福美满。”伊莎贝尔站在我身边，把我胳臂上的肉狠狠拧了一下，疼得我差点没叫出声来，“我在这儿只待很短一段时间，不知道你跟拉里后天能不能到里茨饭店和我一起吃午饭。我请格雷、伊莎贝尔和艾略特·邓普顿一道去。”

“让我问问拉里。他就在跟前。”接下来就是一会儿的停顿。“好的。我们将会很高兴的。”

我讲定了时间，又说了几句客套话，然后就把话筒放下了。此时只见伊莎贝尔眼里出现了一种神情，叫我有点担心。

“你在想什么？”我问她，“我不大喜欢你脸上的神情。”

“很遗憾，我原以为你喜欢我这种神情呢。”

“你不是在心里打什么坏主意吧，伊莎贝尔？”

她一听，把眼睛睁得大大的。

“我向你保证没有。事实上，我急切想看看，在经过了拉里的一番改造之后，索菲是否已脱胎换骨。但愿她去里茨饭店时，不要涂成个大花脸。”





五


我举办的这个小宴会还是挺不错的。格雷和伊莎贝尔先到；五分钟后，拉里和索菲·麦克唐纳也来了。伊莎贝尔和索菲亲热地互吻。之后，伊莎贝尔和格雷对她表示了祝贺，祝贺她跟拉里订婚。寒暄间，只见伊莎贝尔飞眼将索菲打量了一遍。索菲的变化叫我看了吃惊。上次在拉佩街的那家咖啡馆见到她时，她浓妆艳抹，头发染成了红色，穿一件亮色的绿上衣，神情放荡，喝得醉醺醺的，浑身上下具有一种挑逗的味儿和狐狸精的媚劲。而现在她一脸的晦气，虽然比伊莎贝尔小一两岁，样子却比伊莎贝尔老许多。她虽然仍旧将头扬得高高的，不知为什么，却叫我觉得可怜。她的头发正在恢复原色，显出染过色的头发和新长出的头发杂在一起的那种邋遢相。除了嘴唇上涂了些口红之外，她什么脂粉都没有搽。她皮肤粗糙，呈现出不健康的苍白色。记得她的眼珠是鲜亮的绿色，而现在却变得暗淡无光了。她穿一件红衣服，簇新簇新的，还配了同色的帽子、鞋子和手提包。对于女装，我不能说自己是个内行，但我总觉得她的这套行头过于招摇和刺眼，不适合今天的聚会。她胸前戴了一件很俗丽的人造宝石首饰，就是里沃利街卖的那种大路货。伊莎贝尔一身黑绸衣，颈上挂一串人工养殖的珍珠，头戴一顶很漂亮的帽子，把她比得廉价和庸俗。

我点了鸡尾酒，不过拉里和索菲都拒绝喝。后来，艾略特姗姗而至。穿过开阔的前厅时，遇见了一个个的熟人，于是他跟这位先生握握手，又在那位女士的手上吻两下，那样子就好像他是里茨饭店的东家，对光临此处的客人们表示热烈欢迎。索菲的事情，我们什么都没有告诉他，只说她丈夫和孩子在车祸中死于非命，现在要跟拉里喜结良缘。当他最终走到我们面前时，他以自己最精通的那一套礼仪对二人表示祝贺，说出的话落落大方、滴水不漏。随后，大家一道步入餐厅。我们共四男二女，于是我让伊莎贝尔和索菲面对面围圆桌而坐，我和格雷分坐在索菲的两边。桌子小，所以谁说话都可以听得清。午宴是提前订好的，专门侍奉酒水的侍者将酒单送了来。

“你压根就不懂酒，老伙计，”艾略特说，“把酒单给我，阿尔伯特。”他一面翻着酒单，一面还说着话，“我自己只喝维奇矿泉水，但看到别人喝劣等酒，我会受不了的。”

他跟侍奉酒水的侍者阿尔伯特是老朋友。二人经过激烈讨论，才把我应当请客人喝什么酒一事决定了下来。随后，他扭过头来问索菲：

“你们准备到哪儿度蜜月呀，亲爱的？”

他瞧了一眼索菲的衣装，几乎不被人察觉地微微皱了皱眉头，于是我判断他对那套行头看法不佳。

“我们打算到希腊去。”

“这十年里我一直都想到那儿去一趟，”拉里说，“可由于各种原因，始终未能成行。”

“这个季节去，景色一定非常迷人。”伊莎贝尔显出一副很感兴趣的样子说。

她和我都记得，当初拉里准备娶她为妻时，提出要带她去的地方正是希腊。对拉里而言，希腊似乎成了度蜜月的必去之地。

席间的谈话进行得并不怎么容易，假如没有伊莎贝尔出面帮衬，我都觉得难以应付当时的场面了。她的表现极其值得称道。一旦冷场的风险出现时，我便绞尽脑汁想发掘出一个新话题，她则站出来捧场，谈笑风生。我对她心存感激。索菲几乎不说话，只有别人跟她讲话，她才勉强回应几句。她已经没有了精气神，似乎一颗心如死灰一般。我心想可能是拉里在改造她时，对她约束过度，令她难以支撑。我怀疑她以前不但酗酒，而且也吸毒，而今突然戒酒戒毒，定会叫她处于崩溃的边缘。有时候，只见二人你看我一眼，我望你一眼。拉里的眼神里含着温存和鼓励，索菲的眼里透露出的则是哀求，令人顿生恻隐之心。格雷天性忠厚，可能本能地觉察到了我所猜测的情况，于是就跟她聊起来，说他以前有头疼病，什么事都做不了，后来拉里治愈了他，还说他现在都离不开拉里了，对拉里感恩不尽。

“如今，我的身体非常棒，”他滔滔不绝地说着，“只要有机会，我就找工作干。目前正在和几个地方接触，希望不久便会有个眉目。啊，能回国去工作，该多么叫人开心呀。”

格雷倒是出于好心，可是他的话也许有些不分场合。我猜想，拉里曾用暗示术（我称之为“暗示术”）医治格雷，并取得了成功，现在又用同样的方法医治索菲酗酒的顽疾，就不知是否能奏效了。

“你现在一点也不头疼了吗，格雷？”

“三个月都没有疼过了。万一出现头疼的苗头，我就紧紧抓住我的护身符，便能转危为安。”他说着，从口袋里掏出了那枚拉里送给他的古币，“这是宝贝，你就是给我一百万块钱我也不会卖的。”

饭后，咖啡端了上来。侍奉酒水的侍者走过来问我们还要不要喝点酒。我们都婉拒了，只有格雷说要一瓶白兰地。酒送来时，艾略特一定要看看是什么牌子的。

“不错，我觉得不错，对你只有好处没有坏处。”

“先生，你也来一小杯吧？”侍者问。

“哎，我是不能喝的。”

随后，艾略特便详详细细地告诉侍者，说他的肾功能不好，医生不准他喝酒。

“这儿有齐白露加酒，喝一点是不碍事的，先生。人人都知道这种酒对肾有好处。我们刚从波兰进了一批货。”

“真的吗？这种酒如今是很难弄到手的。你拿一瓶来我看看。”

这位侍者胖乎乎的，有点气质，颈上挂了长长的一条银项链，一听这话，转身就去拿酒了。艾略特解释说齐白露加酒是波兰的伏特加，各方面都胜似俄罗斯的伏特加。

“当初住在拉齐维尔府上参加打猎时，我倒是常常喝这种酒。你们可是没见那些波兰王子们是怎样豪饮的。真的，我可一点不夸张，他们大杯大杯地喝酒，眼皮都不眨一下。那可都是些金枝玉叶呀，从头到脚都是皇族味。索菲，你一定要尝上几口。伊莎贝尔，你也一样。这种机会失不再来。”

那位侍者把酒拿了来。拉里、索菲和我都不愿沾唇。而伊莎贝尔说她想尝几口。我感到诧异，因为她平时的酒量是很小的，刚才已经喝过两杯鸡尾酒和两三杯葡萄酒了。侍者把那淡绿色的酒液倒了一杯，伊莎贝尔接过来闻了闻。

“啊，酒香扑鼻呀。”

“是不是？”艾略特高声说道，“这是因为他们在酒里加了一种草药，让酒的味道更加醇香。我来陪你喝一杯吧。喝一点点，对身体并无害处。”

“味道美极了，”伊莎贝尔赞不绝口，“真是像琼浆玉液。这样醇香的酒，以前从没有喝到过。”

艾略特把酒杯举到唇边。

“啊，举杯在手，往事历历如在眼前！你们没有在拉齐维尔府上住过，不知道什么是真正的生活。那种风格真是无与伦比。要知道，那是封建社会的回归，仿佛又回到了中世纪。到车站去迎接你的是套着六匹马的马车以及专门的车夫。吃饭时，每个客人身后都站着个身穿制服的家仆伺候。”

他绘声绘色描述着王府纸醉金迷的生活以及豪华奢侈的宴会。我的心里突然冒出一个疑团（显然是毫无根据的疑团），怀疑这是艾略特和那个侍者精心安排的一出戏，只是为了让艾略特有机会吹嘘吹嘘那个王族以及他在王府结识的波兰贵族们的灯红酒绿的生活。他话匣子一打开，想拦都拦不住了。

“再来一杯吧，伊莎贝尔？”

“哎呀，不敢再喝了。不过，这简直像仙酒，喝了叫人心旷神怡。格雷，咱们也应该买几瓶。”

“我叫人送几瓶到你们家去。”

“真的吗，艾略特舅舅？”伊莎贝尔乐不可支地叫了起来，“你对我们太好啦。格雷，劝你尝一尝。这酒闻起来像新割的稻草和春天的鲜花，像百里香和薰香草，味道柔和、爽口。喝这酒，就像在月光下听音乐一般惬意。”

她说话有点语无伦次，跟平时大不相同。我怀疑她喝醉了。筵席散时，我同索菲握手道别。

“你们什么时候结婚？”我问她。

“下下个星期。希望你能来参加婚礼。”

“恐怕那时候我不在巴黎。我明天就到伦敦去了。”

当我和别的客人道别时，伊莎贝尔把索菲拉到一旁，跟她谈了几句话，然后转向格雷说：

“格雷，我现在还不打算回家去。莫利纽克斯服装店那儿有个时装展览，我要带索菲去看看。应该让她看看新式服装。”

“我很乐意去。”索菲说。

大家就此分手。当晚，我带苏姗娜·鲁维埃去吃了顿饭，第二天上午便起程前往英国了。





六


两个星期后，艾略特来到了克拉里奇酒店。他到后不久，我立刻跑去见他。他给自己定做了几套衣服，看到我，便详细地介绍起他选的是什么料子以及出于什么原因，听得我有些不耐烦。最后，我终于找了个空插进话去，问他拉里的婚礼举办得怎么样。

“就没有举办成。”他冷冷地说。

“这话是什么意思？”

“举办婚礼的前三天，索菲失踪了。拉里到处找她。”

“怎么会有这怪事！他们吵架了吗？”

“没有，没有吵架。当时万事俱备，就等着举行婚礼了。我负责把新娘交给新郎。婚礼之后，他们即刻乘东方快车去度蜜月。要是问起来，我倒觉得这样对拉里更好。”

我猜想伊莎贝尔把所有的一切都告诉了艾略特。

“到底出什么事了？”我问。

你肯定记得那天咱们在里茨饭店吃过饭，伊莎贝尔带索菲去了莫利纽克斯服装店。还记得索菲穿的那件衣服吗？简直不能看！你注意那件衣服的肩部了吗？一件衣服剪裁得好不好，全看肩部合不合体。当然喽，莫利纽克斯服装店的衣服，可怜的索菲是买不起的。你也知道伊莎贝尔是个非常慷慨的人，念着她们自小就认识，她提出要送给索菲一件衣服，至少能让索菲在结婚时穿得体面一些。索菲自然高兴得不得了。长话短说，有一天，伊莎贝尔约索菲三点钟到她家里来，二人一同去服装店最后试样。索菲来了，但不幸的是伊莎贝尔要带两个孩子去看牙医，四点钟之后方才回到家，而索菲已经走了。伊莎贝尔以为她等得不耐烦，自己到莫利纽克斯服装店去了，于是急忙往那儿赶，到了那儿才知道索菲压根就没有去。伊莎贝尔只好作罢，又回到了家里。那天，他们约好要在一起吃晚饭的。拉里按时赶来，伊莎贝尔一见他就问索菲在哪里。

“拉里被问蒙了，急忙给索菲的住处挂电话，但没人接，于是他说自己要到那儿去看看。吃饭的人等啊等的，始终没见他俩露面，最后只好自己吃了。你们在拉佩街巧遇索菲之前，她过的是什么日子，这你应该是知道的。最为不幸的是，你竟然能想到把他们带到那种地方去。拉里跑了一整夜，把她常去的地方找了个遍，但一无所获。他往她住的公寓楼跑了一趟又一趟，而看门人总说她没有回来。他花了三天的时间马不停蹄地找，而她像人间蒸发了一样。第四天，他又去公寓楼打听，看门人说她回来了一趟，把东西打了一个包，乘出租车走了。”

“拉里是不是心里非常难过？”

“我没见他人，只是听伊莎贝尔说他感到挺难过的。”

“索菲没留下纸条什么的吗？”

“什么都没有留。”

我沉吟良久，最后问道：

“你是怎么看待这件事的？”

“老伙计，恐怕跟你的看法完全一致。她坚持不下来了，又故态复萌，继续过她那种醉生梦死的日子了。”

这是明摆着的事实，可我仍觉得有点蹊跷，不明白她为何偏偏在这个节骨眼上开溜。

“伊莎贝尔怎样看？”

“她当然心里不好受。不过，她是个理智的孩子。她告诉我说，她一直觉得拉里要是娶了那样的女人，一定会是场灾难。”

“拉里怎么样啦？”

“伊莎贝尔对他体贴入微。她说难就难在他不愿谈及此事。他一定会恢复过来的。伊莎贝尔说他压根就不爱索菲，和她结婚完全是出自于一片侠肝义胆。”

可以看得出，遇到这突发事件，伊莎贝尔表现得如此淡定，内心八成会感到幸灾乐祸。我敢肯定，下次见到她，她一定会说早就知道会有这种后果。

不过，再次见到她，差不多是在一年之后了。那时，我本可以陈述索菲事件的利害关系，叫她三思，可是鉴于当时的处境，我没有了这份情绪。我在伦敦一直住到圣诞节前夕，然后直接回到里维埃拉自己家里，中途没有在巴黎停留。我着手写一部小说，这以后的几个月里都过着与世隔绝的生活。对于艾略特倒是时不时见上一面。他的健康显然在不断恶化。尽管如此，他仍坚持参加社交活动，看了让人心痛。他还是一如既往地不断举办宴会，要我驱车三十英里赶去参加，而我却不肯，这叫他很是气恼。他觉得我不喜欢社交，却喜欢待在家里写作，显得有些太自命不凡了。

“这是一个非凡的季节，让人激动不已，老伙计。”他对我说道，“把自己关在家里闭门谢客，任大好时光白白流淌，简直就是犯罪。你来里维埃拉，偏偏挑了一个死气沉沉的地区居住，我就是活上一百年也弄不懂。”

可怜、善良又有点傻气的艾略特，显然是活不到那把岁数了。

六月份，小说的初稿已经完成。我觉得自己该休息休息了，于是打起行囊，搭乘一只独桅纵帆船（夏天我们经常乘坐此船去福斯湾洗海水浴），扬起风帆，沿着海岸向马赛驶去。由于海风时起时停，我们的帆船大部分路程都靠备用马达突突突地驱动。中途在戛纳港住了一夜，到了圣马克西姆和萨纳里又各住了一夜，然后就到了土伦。我对土伦港素有好感。港湾里法国舰队的船只让你见了立刻产生一种浪漫和亲切的感觉。在土伦古老的街道上溜达，叫你永远也不会厌倦。我流连于这儿的码头，一待就是好几个小时，观看上岸休假的水兵三三两两地闲逛，有的与女友相依相伴，观看平民百姓迈着悠闲的四方步来来往往，就好像除了享受欢乐的阳光外，世界上再没有其他的事可做了。土伦港水域辽阔，各种轮船和渡船将熙熙攘攘的人群分流到各个码头去，于是你就有了一种印象：此处是终点站，包罗万象，是一个融合了大千世界形形色色特征的地方。当你坐在一家咖啡馆里，眼睛被水色天光弄得有点眼花缭乱时，你的幻想会插上翅膀，带你踏上金色的旅途，到天涯海角去。你幻想着自己坐上一条古老的船，在太平洋上远航，来到一片珊瑚海滩，周围长满了椰子树；你走下舷梯，到了仰光的码头上，坐上一辆黄包车；你幻想着你的船抵达了太子港，停泊在码头旁，你从甲板上望去，看见一群黑人站在码头上，又是欢呼，又是挥手致意。

我们的船是在快到中午的时候抵达的。下午的时间刚过了一半，我上岸沿着码头走去，一边走一边东瞧瞧西看看，看那些店铺，看那些从身边走过的路人，看咖啡馆外边坐在遮阳篷下的客人。突然间，我一眼瞧见了索菲。与此同时，她也看见了我。她嫣然一笑，冲我打了个招呼。我停下来和她握手。她独自坐在一张小桌子旁，面前放一只空玻璃杯。

“请坐下来喝一杯。”她说道。

“你也陪我喝吧。”我说着，在一把椅子上落了座。

她上穿一件法国水手的那种蓝白条子海魂衫，下穿一条大红裤子，脚蹬凉鞋，露出几个大脚趾，趾甲盖上涂了红色的指甲油。她没有戴帽子，头发剪得短短的而且烫过，发色是淡金色，近乎银色。她浓妆艳抹，一如当初在拉佩街遇见她时那样。从桌上的小碟可以看出她已经喝过一两杯了，不过并无醉意，好像见到我没有觉得讨厌。

“巴黎的朋友们还好吗？”她问。

“也许都好着呢。自从那天咱们一起在里茨饭店吃过午饭之后，我就再没有见过他们。”

她从鼻孔里喷出一大股烟，哈哈笑了起来。

“最后我还是没有跟拉里结婚。”

“这我知道。为什么？”

“亲爱的，事到临头，我觉得自己不是抹大拉的马利亚[149]，不配得到耶稣基督的化身拉里的拯救。我做不到，先生。”

“是什么原因使得你在最后关头改变了主意？”

她嬉皮笑脸地望着我，脑袋傲然朝起一扬，小奶子、水蛇腰，再加上她的那身装束，俨然就是个小顽童。不过，必须承认，上次见面时，她一身红装，显得有些俗丽，带几分凄惨，而现在却媚人多了。她的脸和脖子被阳光晒成了紫铜色，而这种肤色令涂了胭脂的脸蛋和抹了睫毛油的眉毛显得分外刺眼——她身上的俗气也不乏妩媚之处。

“想听我说一说吗？”

我点了点头。此时，侍者把我为自己要的啤酒以及为她要的白兰地和苏打水送了来。她用刚抽完的一根粗丝卷烟的烟屁股又燃起了一根。

“那三个月里，我滴酒不沾，一口烟也没有抽过。”她见我露出了诧异的神色，哈哈一笑解释说，“我指的不是纸烟，而是鸦片。那感觉简直是活受罪。有时跟前没人，我就可着嗓门吼叫，能把屋子都震塌。我会对自己说：‘我受不了了，再也受不了了！’和拉里在一起的时候，还不是那么糟糕，而他一旦不在跟前，人间就成了地狱。”

我一直在看着她。当她提到鸦片时，就更加注意打量起她来，发现她的瞳孔缩成针眼一样大，说明她又在吸毒了。她的一对眼珠子特别绿，绿得惊人。

“伊莎贝尔要送我一件婚礼时穿的衣服，不知现在那件衣服怎么样了。那件衣服漂亮极了。当时说好我去找她，然后我们俩一块儿去莫利纽克斯服装店。在这方面，我佩服伊莎贝尔，关于衣服的知识，没有她不知道的。我到了她家，管家说她带琼去看牙医了，给我留了话，说她马上就回来。我走进客厅，见咖啡壶和杯子还放在桌子上，于是便请求管家给我煮一杯咖啡。那时，能提神的只有咖啡了。他说这就为我去煮，走时顺手将空咖啡杯和咖啡壶拿走了，盘子里有一瓶酒却没有拿走。我看了看，发现那酒正是你们在里茨饭店热议的波兰货。”

“那是齐白露加酒。记得艾略特说要送几瓶给伊莎贝尔的。”

“你们对那酒赞不绝口，说闻起来赛过仙醪。我起了好奇心，取下瓶塞闻了闻。果真名不虚传，酒香扑鼻。我点起一支香烟。过了几分钟，管家把咖啡送了进来。咖啡的味道也很好。人人都夸法国的咖啡好，那就让他们喝去吧，反正我还是喜欢美国咖啡。在这异国他乡，我唯一思念的东西就是美国咖啡了。不过，伊莎贝尔的咖啡还是挺不错的。我当时感觉很糟，一杯咖啡下肚，精神便好了些。我看看桌子上放的那瓶酒，心里像有个馋虫在拱动。我骂了自己一句，下定决心不受其引诱。我又点起了一支烟，心想伊莎贝尔马上就会回来的，可是左等右等不见她来。我感到发毛，坐立不宁。我最怕等人，而屋里连本书都没有。我走来走去的，欣赏着墙上的画，眼光却不停地瞟向那瓶可恶的酒。后来，我想干脆倒一杯出来，欣赏欣赏吧。倒出来一看，那颜色十分漂亮。”

“是淡绿色的。”

“一点不错。怪就怪在，它的颜色就跟它的酒香一样诱人。那种绿色就像你有时候在一朵白玫瑰花心里看见的绿色一样。我迫切想知道它喝起来是不是味道也同样诱人，觉得反正品上一口也于我无害。我原打算只呷一口，却听见了响动，以为伊莎贝尔回来了，便咕咚将一整杯酒吞下了肚，怕的是被伊莎贝尔瞧见我在喝酒。不过，那不是伊莎贝尔弄出的响动。天呀，一杯酒让我感到飘飘欲仙。自从戒酒以来，我还从未产生过如此美妙的感觉。我感到周身又充满了活力。假如伊莎贝尔及时回来，我恐怕已嫁给了拉里。真不知道是祸是福呢。”

“她没有回来吗？”

是的，没有回来。我很生气，觉得她太看不起人，叫我那样等她。此时，我低头一瞧，见杯子里又斟满了酒，心想可能是自己无意中斟上的。信不信由你，我不知道酒是怎么斟满的。再把酒倒回瓶子里吧，好像怪不值得的，于是我便将它喝了下去。没得说，那酒简直就是琼浆玉液。我喝后觉得自己好像变了个人，直想开怀大笑。三个月来，我从未感到如此惬意过。

“那个老家伙曾说波兰人大杯大杯地喝酒，眼皮都不眨一下，这你还记得吗？我心想，哼，管它的，狗日的波兰人能喝，我也能喝。于是，我把剩下的咖啡倒在壁炉里，给杯子里斟酒，斟得满满的。管它什么琼浆玉液不玉液的，喝他娘的！后来的情况我就记不清了，只记得等我罢手时，瓶子里的酒已所剩不多。这时，我觉得三十六计走为上计。这一走，却差点跟伊莎贝尔撞上。刚出她家的门，我就听见了琼的说话声，于是急忙跑上楼梯。等她们母女进了门，我才连滚带爬冲下楼，钻进了一辆出租车。我叫司机赶快把车开走。司机问我到哪儿去，我却冲着他哈哈大笑不止，觉得自己的行为滑稽到了极点。”

“你回你的公寓了吗？”我这是明知故问，因为我知道她没有回公寓。

“你把我当什么傻瓜了吧？我知道拉里会到公寓楼找我的。那些常去的地方，我一个都不敢去，而是到哈基姆那里去了。我知道拉里是绝不会找到那里的。再说，我想过过烟瘾呢。”

“哈基姆是个什么地方？”

“哈基姆嘛，哈基姆是个阿尔及利亚人。在他那里，只要你出得起钱，他就可以给你搞来鸦片。他很够朋友，要什么人就给你弄来什么人——大人、小孩、女人或者黑人。他手边总有六七个阿尔及利亚人随叫随到。我在那里住了三天，都弄不清自己睡过多少男人了。”说到这里，她咯咯一笑，“高的矮的、胖的瘦的、白的黑的，全都有。我要把失去的时间补回来。可是，我的内心并不踏实，觉得在巴黎不安全，老怕拉里会找到我。而且，我身上的钱都花光了。那些兔崽子，你不给他们钱，他们就不和你上床。所以，我离开哈基姆那里，回到公寓楼，给了看门人[150]一百法郎，让她见有人来找我，就说我已经走了。我当下便打点行装，连夜乘火车来到了土伦。到了这里，我心里的一块石头才算落了地。”

“来了后，你就一直待在这里吗？”

“一点不错，而且我要继续待下去。这儿的鸦片烟要多少有多少，是水手们从东方带来的，上等货色，不是他们在巴黎卖给你的那种烂狗屎。我在旅馆里包了一个房间——就是那家海事商务旅馆。晚上你走进旅馆，过道里全是鸦片烟味。”说着，她风骚劲十足地嗅了嗅鼻子，“那味道香喷喷的，有点刺鼻。大家各在各的房间里抽鸦片，给你一种宾至如归的感觉。旅馆不干涉你的事，你带谁回房间都无所谓。他们会在凌晨五点来敲你的门，提醒水手起床归船，所以你就不用担心会误了行期。”说到这里，她话锋一转，又不停点地说了下去，“我在码头边的书店看见了你的书。早知道要碰见你，我就会买下来，叫你签个名呢。”

刚才路过那家书店，我曾停下来看橱窗，注意到在一堆新书里面有一本我的小说的法译本，是新近出版的。

“你可能不会多么感兴趣的。”我说道。

“我不明白你为什么这样说。我可是会读的。”

“恐怕你也会写呢。”

她飞了我一眼，随即爆发出一串笑声。

“是的，小时候经常写几句歪诗。恐怕都是些涂鸦之作，但我那时的感觉很好。我想这些是拉里告诉你的。”说到此处，她稍微停顿了一下，“生活艰辛，应该学会苦中取乐。有乐不取，就是个大傻瓜。”说着，她倔强地把脑袋朝后一扬，“我把书买来，你能给我签个名吗？”

“我明天就走了。你真要的话，我买一本送你，留在你的旅馆里。”

“那太好了。”

就在这时，一艘海军的摩托艇开到了码头边，一群水手争先恐后上了岸。索菲用眼睛在他们当中搜索着。

“那是我的男朋友。”她向其中的一个挥了挥胳臂，“你可以请他喝一杯酒，然后最好离开我们。他是个科西嘉人，和咱们的老朋友耶和华一样喜欢拈酸吃醋。”

一个年轻人走了过来，看到我，先是迟疑了一下，见索菲向他招手，便来到了我们的桌前。他高高的个子，紫红脸膛，胡子刮得干干净净，黑眼珠神采奕奕，鹰钩鼻，一头卷发乌黑乌黑，看上去还不到二十岁。索菲介绍我时，说我是她童年时代的一个美国朋友。

“他不会说话，但长得漂亮。”索菲用英语对我说。

“你喜欢粗野豪放类型的，是不是？”

“越是粗野豪放越合我的心意。”

“总有一天，你的喉咙会被他们割断的。”

“这一点也不奇怪。”她咧嘴一笑说，“早死早好。”

“你们能不能讲法语呢？”水手厉声说。

索菲冲他微微一笑，笑容里含着几分嘲弄，接下来讲了一通法语，语调流畅，夹杂着一些俗语，美国口音很重，但这样一来，却使她平日使用的下流猥亵语言带有一种滑稽腔调，使人忍俊不禁。

“我在对他讲，说你长得漂亮，怕你不好意思，才用的英语。”随后，她对我说：“他身体很棒，肌肉发达得就像个拳击手。你摸摸看。”

索菲的一番奉承叫水手怒意顿消。他得意地把胳膊一弯，鼓起胳膊上的二头肌。

“你摸摸看。”他说道，“来呀，来摸呀。”

我摸了摸，表示自己羡慕得不得了。我们在一起聊了几分钟。之后，我付了酒钱，起身要走。

“我得告辞了。”

“见到你很高兴。别忘了那本书。”

“不会的。”

我跟他俩握手道别，然后抽身离开了。途中经过书店时，买下了那本小说，在书上写了我和索菲的名字。这时，我突然想起了龙沙[151]那首广为引用的精美小诗，又想不出别的什么可写，便将小诗的第一句写在了书上：

亲爱的，让我们看看这玫瑰花……

我把书留在了索菲的旅馆里。旅馆就靠近码头，我自己也常住在那里。天麻麻亮，你就会被大喇叭吵醒，叫唤人们快起来上班去；阳光如烟似雾，照在港湾平静的水面上，给幽灵一般的船只披上了一层美丽的色彩。次日，我们的船扬帆驶往卡西斯。我准备在那里买些酒，然后到马赛去，在马赛再换乘一艘预订好的船。一个星期后，我回到了家里。





七


我看到艾略特的男仆约瑟夫写来的一封信，说艾略特卧病在床，很想见见我。于是，次日我便驱车去了安提比斯。约瑟夫在领我上楼见他主人之前，告诉我说艾略特突患尿毒症，医生认为病情不容乐观，好在他挺了过来，现在病情好转；不过，他的肾脏有问题，不可能完全康复。约瑟夫跟随艾略特四十年，对他忠心耿耿，可是，尽管表面显得难过，却不难看出内心在幸灾乐祸——仆人们多数如此，一旦主人家祸起萧墙，他们不忧反乐。

“先生真可怜。[152]”约瑟夫叹了口气说，“他有他的怪癖，但归根结底也算是个好人。人迟早都是要死的。”

他说话的口气就好像艾略特眼看就要断气了似的。

“我敢说他把你今后的生活已安排好了，约瑟夫。”我板着脸说。

“但愿如此。”他语气哀痛地说。

他把我领进艾略特的卧房时，我却意外地看到艾略特一副生龙活虎的样子。他固然脸色苍白、面相衰老，但精神头很好。他刮了脸，头发梳得整整齐齐，身穿淡蓝色丝绸睡衣，睡衣口袋上绣着他姓名的缩写字母，而字母上方则绣着他的伯爵冠饰。在翻过来的被单上，也绣有这些字母和冠饰，型号比睡衣上的要大许多。

我问他感觉如何。

“感觉好极了。”他乐呵呵地说，“只不过偶染小恙，用不了几天就可以活蹦乱跳了。我约了迪米特里大公在星期六和我共进午餐。我已告诉了我的医生，让他无论如何要在这之前把我的病治好。”

我陪他坐了半小时，出来时告诉约瑟夫，说如果他的病复发，就来通知我。一个星期后，我到一个邻居家赴午宴，却惊奇地发现艾略特也在那里，穿着礼服，脸色像死人。

“你不应该出来，艾略特。”我对他说。

“胡说什么呀，老伙计。弗里达请了玛法达公主呢。从路易莎在罗马任上的时候起，我认识意大利王室已有多年了。我说什么也不能叫可怜的弗里达失望。”

他年事已高，且身患绝症，对社交活动却始终保持着高涨的热情，真不知是应该敬佩他不屈不挠的精神还是应该可怜他。你绝对不会想到他这个样子，竟然是个病人。他就像一个垂死的演员，脸上涂了油彩，登台表演时，立刻忘掉了病痛。他担任捧场的角色，潇洒自如地将此角色扮演得极其到位，对客人们和蔼可亲、殷勤周到，用他最擅长的手法捧臀啜屁，却妙语如珠，令人开怀。我觉得自己从未见过他把社交艺术发挥到如此高的水平。当公主殿下离开时，艾略特弓腰送行，风度雅致，既表现了对公主崇高身份的尊敬，又表现了一个老人对一个年轻美丽女子的景慕，令人叹为观止。难怪设宴的女主人事后称他为宴会的生命和灵魂。

几天后，他又卧倒在了病床上。医生对他下了禁令，不许他离开房间半步。艾略特为此感到非常窝火。

“早不病晚不病，偏偏这个时候病了。社交季节正如火如荼。”

他列了一长串重量级人物的名单，说他们夏天齐聚里维埃拉。

我每隔三四天都去探望他一次。他有时候躺在床上，有时候穿一件华丽的晨衣坐在一把躺椅上。这种晨衣他似乎备有无数件，记得从未见他穿重过样。八月初的一天，我又去看望他，发现他反常地少言寡语。迎我进门时，约瑟夫曾告诉我，说他病情有所好转，所以见他如此没有精神头，我便觉得有些奇怪了。我把自己得来的一些当地的小道消息讲给他听，想让他高兴起来，他却一点兴趣也没有。他双眉微蹙，脸上有种愠怒的表情，这在他是少见的。

“埃德娜·诺威马里举办宴会，你去参加吗？”他冷不丁这样问道。

“不去。怎么啦？”

“她邀请你了没有？”

“里维埃拉的每个人她都邀请了。”

诺威马里王妃原是美国的一个腰缠万贯的富婆，嫁给了一位罗马的王子，此王子可不是意大利的那种穷得叮当响的普通王子，而是一个伟大家族的族长，一个雇佣兵队长的后代——那个队长在十六世纪曾为自己开拓出了一个公国。诺威马里王妃年已六十，是个寡妇，由于不满意大利法西斯政权对她美国的进项课以重税，便来到法国，在戛纳山背面的一块漂亮的土地上盖了一幢佛罗伦萨风格的别墅。她特意从意大利运来大理石，为她那些大客厅的墙壁镶边，还从国外请来画家给她画天顶画。她的藏画和铜像都异常精美；连素来不喜欢意大利家具的艾略特，也不得不承认她的家具十分华贵。她家的花园美观漂亮，游泳池造价肯定不菲。她请客高朋满座，每次都不少于二十个人。她安排好在八月里月圆时举行一次化装舞会。虽然还有三个星期的时间，里维埃拉已经到处都在谈论这次舞会了。那天晚上要放焰火，她还要从巴黎带一个黑人乐队过来助兴。那些流亡的王公贵族相互谈论时又是羡慕，又是妒忌，认为她这一晚的花费足够他们一年的用度。

“真是气派呀。”有的人说。

“简直是发疯。”有的人说。

“没品位。”有的人说。

“你准备穿什么样的衣服？”艾略特问我。

“我不是告诉你了么，艾略特，我就不打算去。你以为我这把岁数了还会穿得花里胡哨去参加什么化装舞会。”

“她没有邀请我。”他声音嘶哑地说。

说完，他用一双倦怠无神的眼睛望着我。

“哦，她会请的。”我平心静气地说，“请帖肯定还在陆续发着呢。”

“她不会请我的。”他声音有些哽咽地说，“这是故意叫我下不了台。”

“哎，艾略特，这我就不能相信了。中间肯定是有些疏漏。”

“我可不是个容人蔑视的人。”

“再怎么说，你身体不好，反正也去不成。”

“去不成也要去。这是本季节最盛大的一次聚会。我只要还有一口气，就是爬着也要去。我要把我的祖先劳里亚伯爵的那套礼服穿在身上。”

我真不知说什么好了，于是干脆闭上了嘴。

“就在你来之前，保罗·巴顿来看过我。”艾略特突然开口说道。

我不能指望读者还记得这个人，因为我自己也得重温前文看我究竟给了他一个什么名字。保罗·巴顿就是那个由艾略特引进伦敦社交界，后来觉得艾略特派不上用场，就不再理会他的美国青年，艾略特恨他恨得牙根痒痒。此人近来相当引人注目，先是因为他加入了英国国籍，后来又由于他娶了一个报界巨头的千金，而这位巨头已经晋升为贵族了。有了这样的后台，再加上此人八面玲珑，显然前途不可限量。艾略特为此像吃了黄连一样心里感到苦涩。

“夜里一旦醒来，听见老鼠窸窸窣窣在壁橱里爬动，我就心想：‘这是保罗·巴顿在朝上爬。’请相信我的话，老伙计，这家伙早晚能钻进上议院的。谢天谢地，那一天我是看不到了。”

“他来这儿有何贵干？”我问。我和艾略特心里都很清楚，这个年轻人无事不登三宝殿。

“让我告诉你，他有何贵干吧。”艾略特气得咆哮道，“他想借用我祖先劳里亚伯爵的那套礼服。”

“恬不知耻！”

“难道你看不出他的用心？显然，他知道埃德娜没有邀请我，也不打算邀请我。这是埃德娜唆使他来气我的。那条老母狗。没有我，她哪有今日。当初，我特意为她举办宴会，她认识的人都是我介绍的。她和自己的司机睡觉，这个当然你也是知道的。真叫人恶心！巴顿来了告诉我，说她要给花园里张灯结彩，还要放焰火。谁不知道我最爱看的就是放焰火。他说许多人死乞白赖跟埃德娜要请帖，却都一一碰壁，因为埃德娜不愿人多，想把宴会办得别开生面。听他说话的口气，就好像我肯定是在被邀请之列似的。”

“你准备把礼服借给他吗？”

“让他去死吧，恨不得把他送进十八层地狱。我就是死了穿着它下葬也不借给他。”说到这里，艾略特猛地从床上坐起，像个发了疯的女人一样，把身子晃来晃去的，“全都是些狼心狗肺的东西。”他咬牙切齿地说，“我恨他们，我恨他们所有的人。当我能够为他们捧场时，他们无一不围着我转。现在我又老又病，他们就把我弃如敝屣。自从我卧床不起，来探望的人不超过十个。这都一个星期了，只可怜巴巴地送来了一束花。我为他们可以说是尽心尽力。他们吃我的喝我的，我为他们跑前跑后，为他们张罗宴会，鞠躬尽瘁地为他们服务。可是，我得到什么回报了呢？什么也没有，一点回报也没有。没有一个人关心我的死活。天呀，全都是些绝情绝义的坏东西。”说到伤心处，他嘤嘤地哭出了声来，大滴大滴的眼泪顺着皱巴巴的脸颊直朝下滚，“真后悔呀，当初就不该离开美国。”

看见这个不久于人世的老人仅仅因为别人没有请他去赴宴，便像个孩子一样号啕大哭，着实可悲可怜。这样的一幅情景叫人吃惊，也难免会心生恻隐。

“不请你也没有关系，艾略特，”我说，“也许那天晚上会下雨，叫他们放不成焰火。”

他一听，就像人们所说的快死的人抓住了一根救命稻草一样，含着泪花笑了起来。

“我怎么没想到。我祈求上天，无比虔诚地祈求上天，愿到时候天降大雨。你说得不错，叫他们放不成焰火。”

我的几句话让他改变了想法，放弃了那些愚蠢的念头。待我辞别时，他即便不是心情快活，也起码是心平气和了。不过，我还是放心不下，一回到家就给埃德娜·诺威马里挂了个电话，说我次日到戛纳去，问能不能和她一起吃顿午饭。后来，她叫人传话来，说她很高兴请我吃饭，但仅仅是便宴。可是我到达后，却发现除她之外，还有十位客人也在场。她是个挺不错的人，慷慨大方、热情好客，只有一个坏毛病，那就是嘴上不饶人。即便是对好朋友，她也会在背后说人家的坏话。这倒不是说她天性恶毒，而是因为大脑愚钝，再想不出别的方式引起别人的注意了。她说的话传出去，被她中伤的人就不再搭理她了。不过，她举办的宴会总是别开生面，过上一阵子，大多数被她得罪的人就觉得不便跟她斤斤计较了。我觉得一开口就求她邀请艾略特来参加即将举办的盛会，会让艾略特丢面子，想想还是见机行事的好。她对这次盛会兴致很高，吃饭时把话头全集中在了这上面。

“艾略特一定会高兴死的，这下子算是有机会穿他那套菲力普二世时代的礼服了。”我尽量做出一副漫不经心的样子随口说道。

“我没有邀请他。”她说道。

“为什么没邀请？”我装作诧异地问。

“为什么要请他呢？他在社交圈子里已风光不再，纯粹是个老厌物、势利眼，就喜欢传播流言蜚语。”

这一番指控用在她自己的身上倒是挺合适的。我觉得她太刻薄，蠢里蠢气的。

“再说，”她又补加了一句，“我想让保罗把艾略特的那件礼服穿上。保罗穿上一定显得很高贵。”

我不再说话，但决心要替艾略特把他朝思暮想的请帖弄到手，不管用什么样的手段都在所不惜。午饭后，埃德娜把她的朋友们带到花园里去散步。这给了我可乘之机。我曾经有一次在这里做过几天客，所以知道一点她家的情况。我猜想可能还会有些请帖剩下来，保存在秘书的房间里。我悄悄向那儿溜去，打算拿一张请帖塞进口袋，回去后写上艾略特的名字寄给他。我知道他病得厉害，根本无法成行，但能拿到这份请帖对他而言却意义重大。可是一推开房门，我却惊呆了，只见埃德娜的秘书坐在她的办公桌旁。我原以为她还没有吃完午饭呢。秘书是个中年的苏格兰女子，名叫吉斯小姐，沙色头发，雀斑脸，戴一副夹鼻眼镜，显出一副守身如玉的处女气质。我急忙稳定住情绪。

“王妃带客人们到花园散步去了。我没事，想着就到你这儿来抽根烟吧。”

“欢迎你来。”

吉斯小姐说话时带有苏格兰语的那种小舌颤音。和自己喜欢的人在一起时，她会表现出一种“干幽默”，而此时她的小舌颤音就颤得更厉害了，会惹得听者发笑。可是，你禁不住笑出声来时，她则向你投来气恼、诧异的目光，就好像她认为你昏了头，竟然觉得她的话好笑。

“这次举办那宴会肯定给你增加了不少负担，吉斯小姐。”我说道。

“忙得团团转，都分不清东南西北了。”

知道她可以信赖，于是我开门见山地说：

“为什么王妃没有邀请邓普顿先生呢？”

吉斯小姐那不苟言笑的脸上此时浮出一丝笑容，说道：

“你知道她是怎样的人。她跟他有过节。是她亲自从客人名单上把他的名字划掉的。”

“你知道，他已是垂死之人了，这辈子也离不开病床了。受到如此冷落，他心里难过到了极点。”

“如果他不想跟王妃闹翻，他就不应该逢人便说王妃跟自己的司机睡觉。她的司机是有老婆的，还有三个孩子呢。”

“她到底睡了没有？”

吉斯小姐的目光从夹鼻眼镜的上方瞟过来，望了我一眼。

“我当秘书已经有二十一个年头了。我有一个原则，那就是相信自己的雇主像白雪一样纯洁。必须承认，有时候我的某个雇主会发现自己已有三个月的身孕，而老爷去非洲猎狮，去了有半个年头。此时，我对女主人坚信不疑的原则会经受严峻的考验。不过，女主人只要到巴黎去一趟，进行一次极其昂贵的短途旅行，就会化险为夷。我和女主人便如释重负，长长松一口气。”

“吉斯小姐，我并不是想抽烟才到这儿来的。我来是想偷一张请帖亲自寄给邓普顿先生。”

“这样做十分不妥当。”

“我也知道不妥当。行行好，吉斯小姐，那就请你给我一张请帖吧。那个可怜的老人反正也是来不了的，只是给他张请帖叫他高兴高兴。他没有什么叫你感到不痛快的地方吧？”

“没有。他对我总是客客气气的。我敢说他是真正的绅士，比大多数跑到王妃这儿骗吃骗喝的人都要强。”

所有重要人物的身边都有些得宠的下属。这些仰人鼻息的人，你是万万得罪不起的。假如他们觉得自己没有得到应有的尊重，他们就会在主子面前放你的冷箭，挑拨离间。和这些人，你是必须要搞好关系的。艾略特比任何人都更懂得这一点，所以对那些穷亲戚、老年女佣或者受主人信赖的秘书，见了面他总会亲热地寒暄几句，或者热忱地赔个笑脸。我敢说，他肯定经常跟吉斯小姐说开心的话，过圣诞节时不会忘了送给她一盒巧克力、一个化妆盒或者一个手提包。

“求求你，吉斯小姐，发个善心吧。”

吉斯小姐把夹鼻眼镜在她那高鼻梁上固定得更牢了些。

“毛姆先生，我坚信你绝不愿意让我去干对我的雇主不忠实的事情；再说，万一叫那个老母牛发现我违背了她的意愿，必定会炒我的鱿鱼。请帖就在这张桌子上，装在信封里。我现在要到窗户跟前向外瞭望瞭望，一是因为我在一个位置上坐得太久了，腿有点僵，想活动一下；二是因为想欣赏一下窗外美丽的景色。当我将脸转过去的时候，背后发生什么事，不管是老天还是任何人都不能叫我为之负责了。”

当吉斯小姐重新回到她的座位上时，请帖已经进了我的口袋。

“今天见到你，真是叫人舒心，吉斯小姐。”我说着，伸出了手，“化装舞会上你准备穿什么服装？”

“我亲爱的先生，我是牧师的女儿，”她回答说，“这种荒唐的事情就让那些上层阶级的人去做吧。只要把《先驱报》和《邮报》的代表们招待好，让他们酒足饭饱，我的责任就算尽到了。我将回到卧室里去，安安静静地看我的侦探小说。”





八


两三天后，我登门去看望艾略特，发现他满脸喜色。

“瞧，”他说道，“我收到请帖了，是今天上午收到的。”

说完，他从枕头下取出请帖递给我看。

“我不是早就告诉过你了么。”我说道，“要知道，你的姓是以T开头的。显然，秘书写请帖才轮到你。”

“我还没有写回信呢。明天会写的。”

我一听，吓了一大跳。

“愿不愿意让我代笔？我走时可以将回信送到邮局去。”

“哪里的话！为什么要你代笔？我完全能自己写回信的。”

我暗忖，幸亏拆信人将会是吉斯小姐。她又不傻，肯定会把信扣下来的。这时，艾略特摇了摇铃说：

“我想让你看看我的礼服。”

“你不是真的要去吧，艾略特？”

“当然要去。自从去比奥蒙茨家参加过那次舞会之后，这套礼服再没有穿过。”

约瑟夫听见铃声走了进来，艾略特让他把礼服取来。那套礼服放在一个大大的扁平盒子里，用薄棉纸包着。这里面有白绸长袜、带衬里的白锦缎裹边的织金布紧身裤，配一件紧身上衣、一件大氅、一条围在脖子上的绉领、一个平顶丝绒便帽、一条长金链子，链子的一头挂着金羊毛勋章。我认出这套礼服是根据提香所画的菲力普二世穿的那套豪华服装仿制的，而那幅画就在普拉多。艾略特却告诉我，说这套礼服是劳里亚伯爵在参加西班牙国王和英国女王的婚礼时穿过的，这就让我觉得他的想象太离谱了。

次日上午正在吃早饭时，我被叫去接电话。电话是约瑟夫打来的，说艾略特夜间又发病了，他急忙把医生请了来，医生说艾略特恐怕连今天也熬不过去了。我让服务生将汽车开过来，然后驱车前往安提比斯。艾略特正处于昏迷状态。艾略特原先坚决不肯用护士，可是我却看见有个护士在场，是医生从那个位于尼斯与博略之间的英国医院找来的，这令我看了心里感到欣慰。我出去给伊莎贝尔发了封电报。她和格雷带着孩子正在拉波勒的那个比较便宜的海滨度假地消夏，来安提比斯要走很远的路，恐怕来不及为艾略特送终了。她还有两个哥哥，但和艾略特多年不见，所以她算是艾略特在世的唯一亲人了。

不过，艾略特求生的欲望异常强烈，要不然就是医生用的药产生了作用，反正就在这一天他恢复了意识。尽管已是垂危之人，他仍强打起精神说俏皮话，问了几个有关于护士性生活的下流问题。这天下午的大部分时间，我都守在他身旁。第二天又去看他，发现他虽然身体十分虚弱，情绪却很好。护士只允许我在跟前待很短一点时间。发给伊莎贝尔的电报仍未见回音，这让我感到焦虑。由于不知道伊莎贝尔在拉波勒的地址，电报发到了巴黎去。怕就怕门房转送电报时耽搁了时间。两天之后，我才收到了回电，说他们立刻启程。事情很不凑巧，伊莎贝尔和格雷乘汽车到布列塔尼游玩去了，刚刚接到我的电报。我查了一下列车时刻表，发现他们至少要三十六个小时才能赶来。

次日一大早，约瑟夫把电话又打了来，说艾略特夜间病情恶化，提出要见我。我一听，急急忙忙赶了过去。我一到，约瑟夫便将我拉到一旁说：

“先生，如果我说的事情不合时宜，请你原谅我的冒昧。按说，我是不信教的，认为所有的宗教只不过是神父玩弄的阴谋诡计，为的是控制人们的思想。可是，先生也知道，女人们并不这么想。我的妻子和女佣都坚持认为我们的主人应该得到最后的祝福。现在时间已所剩不多。”他用眼睛看着我，一脸难为情的神色，“现在的事情谁也说不清。也许，一个人临死之前，最好还是改善与教会的关系。”

他的心态我很清楚。大多数法国人，不管平时怎样揶揄嘲笑宗教，但宗教毕竟跟他们血肉相连，一旦生命到了终点，他们还是愿意妥协的。

“你是要我向他提出吗？”

“先生如果愿意，那是再好不过了。”

这个差事我并不怎么喜欢，但是，艾略特毕竟多少年来都是个虔诚的天主教徒，所以，履行一个天主教徒的职责也是理所当然的。我上楼走进他的房间，见他平躺在床上，脸色憔悴，瘦得都成了个干巴人，但神志十分清楚。我让护士出去一会儿。

“你的病情恐怕十分危重了，艾略特。”我启口说道，“不知道……不知道你愿不愿意请个牧师来？”

他看着我，半天没说话。

“你的意思是说我就要死了？”

“哦，但愿不是这样。不过，不怕一万就怕万一么。”

“我懂了。”

他一时哑了口。

这是一个令人痛心的时刻——明知此话会刺激艾略特，却又不得不说。我不忍心看他，咬紧牙关，生怕会哭出声来。此时，我坐在床沿上，面向他，伸出一只胳臂撑着身体。

他在我的手背上拍了拍，说道：

“别难过，老伙计。要知道，这是必须走的一步。”

我听了，破涕为笑，说道：

“你真是个奇怪的家伙，艾略特。”

“这就对了。现在打电话给主教，说我要忏悔并且接受涂油礼[153]。如果能把查尔斯神父派来，我将感激不尽。他是我的朋友。”

查尔斯神父是主教的代理人，在前边的一章里提到过。我下楼去打电话，跟主教通上了话。

“很急吗？”他问。

“十万火急。”

“我这就办理。”

医生来时，我把刚才的事情跟他讲了讲。随后，他便带着护士上楼去看艾略特，而我守候在楼下的餐厅里。从尼斯来安提比斯只有二十分钟的车程，所以过了半小时多一点，就有一辆黑颜色的大轿车停在了门口。约瑟夫跑来找我。

“是主教本人，先生[154]，”他慌慌张张地说，“主教大人亲自来了。”

我急忙迎出门去。这次，主教没有像往常那样身旁跟着那位代理人，不知怎么却带来了一个年轻的神父，这位神父手捧一个匣子，我想里面可能装的是施涂油礼的用具。司机紧随其后，手提一只寒碜的黑色旅行箱。主教和我握了手，把同来的神父介绍给了我。

“咱们的那位可怜的朋友怎么样了？”

“恐怕已处于病危状态，主教大人。”

“是不是请你把我们带到哪个房间里去，让我们把法衣换上。”

“这儿是餐厅，主教大人。客厅在楼上。”

“到餐厅里换就很好了。”

我把他领进了餐厅，然后和约瑟夫在过厅里等候。不一会儿，门开了，主教走了出来，后面跟着神父；神父双手捧着一只圣餐杯，杯子上放一个小盘子，里面有一块行圣礼用的圣饼。

这些东西用一块细麻纱餐巾盖着，而麻纱是透明的。之前，我只是在晚宴或午宴上见到过主教，知道他是个大肚汉，喜欢美食美酒，喜欢讲幽默故事，有时甚至还讲些粗俗的笑话。那时候，他给我的印象是一个身体结实强壮的人，只有中等身材。今天他穿上白法衣，披上圣带，看上去不但个头很高，而且庄严肃穆。他的那张红脸，平时总是乐呵呵的，笑容可掬，现在却一副严肃相。从外表上看，过去的那个骑兵军官在他身上找不到一丝痕迹了；此刻，他的面相符合于他在教会的实际地位，一看就知道是个显贵人物。难怪约瑟夫见了肃然起敬，在胸前画了个十字。主教身子微微一躬，点了点头。

“领我去见病人吧。”他说道。

我闪开身子，让他先上楼，而他却叫我走在前边。于是，我们一声不响，一脸严肃地上了楼。我先一步走进艾略特的病房通报道：

“主教大人亲自来了，艾略特。”

艾略特挣扎着坐了起来。

“主教大人亲自光临，我感到不胜荣幸。”

“你别动，我的朋友。”主教叫了一声，然后对我和护士说：“请你们先出去一下。”接着，他又转向那个神父叮咛道：“你也出去，到时候我叫你。”

神父四下里瞧瞧，我猜想他很可能是要找个地方放下手中的圣杯，于是就将梳妆台上的那把玳瑁壳镶背的发刷推开为他腾地方。护士下楼去了，我把神父领进隔壁的房间，此处是艾略特的书房。书房的窗户敞开着，望得见外边的蓝天。他走到一扇窗户前观景。我则坐下来休息。海上正在进行帆船赛，白帆在蓝天的映衬下显得格外耀眼。一条黑壳的大船张起红色的船帆，迎着微风向港口驶来。我认出那是一条捕捞龙虾的船，从撒丁岛那儿满载而归，为赌场提供海鲜，让那些寻欢作乐的赌徒们大快朵颐。艾略特的房门关闭着，却仍能听得见里面有隐隐约约的说话声。艾略特在做忏悔。我烟瘾大发，想点一根烟，却又怕神父不高兴。神父是个身材瘦削的年轻人，一动不动地站在那儿向外眺望，黑黑的头发呈波浪状，一双乌黑的眼睛秀秀气气的，皮肤呈橄榄色，一看就知道是意大利人。他的脸上洋溢着南方人的那种蓬勃的生命力，我不由得心里想到，真不知他有着多么坚定的信仰和燃烧的激情，才使得他放弃了现世开心的生活、青春的欢乐以及世俗人的七情六欲，转而真诚地为上帝服务。

隔壁房间的声音忽然停止了，我抬起头，见门打开了，主教出来了。

“你来吧！[155]”他对神父说道。

屋子里只剩下了我一个人。接着，我听见隔壁房间又传来了主教的声音，情知他在念祈祷词，即教会规定为垂死之人所应该念的祈祷词。随之而至的又是一阵沉寂，我知道艾略特在吃圣餐[156]。恐怕是受到远祖的影响，我虽然不是一个天主教徒，但是每次做弥撒时，听见主的仆人摇着小铃通知人们领圣餐时，总会浑身发抖，产生恐惧感，此时亦哆嗦不已，仿佛寒意传遍全身，心里又害怕又奇怪。书房的门又被推开了。

“你可以进来了。”主教对我说道。

我走进艾略特的房间，见神父正在把细麻纱餐巾盖在圣杯以及盛放过圣饼的那个镀金小盘子上。艾略特的两眼熠熠生辉。

“劳驾你送主教大人上车！”他对我说。

我们一行走下楼去。约瑟夫率三个女佣正等候在过厅里。女佣们热泪盈眶，依次走上前来，跪下亲吻主教的戒指。主教伸出两个指头放在她们头上，为她们祝福。约瑟夫的妻子用胳膊碰了碰他，于是他步上前去，也跪倒在地，吻了吻主教的戒指。主教微微一笑说：

“你是不信教的吧，我的孩子？”

我可以看见约瑟夫在努力保持镇静。

“是的，主教大人。”

“不必介意。你对主人忠心耿耿。上帝对你在认识上的错误会忽略不计的。”

我陪主教到了马路上，为他开了汽车门。他向我弓腰致谢，临上车前冲我仁慈地一笑说：

“咱们可怜的朋友已生命垂危。他表面上是有些缺点的，但内心对自己的同胞宽宏大度、善良慈祥。”





九


想着艾略特刚接受过圣礼，也许不愿见人，我便进了客厅，看起书来。谁知屁股刚坐稳，护士就跑了来，说艾略特想见我。我爬上那串楼梯到了他的房间。他接受圣礼之前，医生曾给他打过一针，叫他振作起来，此时不知是因为这一针的效力，还是因为情绪激动，反正他一副兴奋的样子，眼睛闪闪发光。

“这是莫大的荣誉呀，我的老伙计。”他说道，“这下子，我可以拿着教会一位重要人物的介绍信进天国了。我想，天国里各家各户都会敞开大门欢迎我的。”

“恐怕你会发现那儿什么样的人都有。”我笑了笑说。

“也许你不会相信，我的老伙计，我们从《圣经》上得知，天国和人间一样是有等级区别的。那儿有六翼天使和四翼天使，有天使长和普通天使。在人世间，我游走于欧洲的上流社会，到了天国我毫无疑问也将游走于那儿的上流社会。主曾经说过：‘在我父的家园里有千万住房，分配时应该让众民各得其所。’”

我怀疑艾略特把天国的住房想象成了罗慈吉尔兹男爵的城堡那样的风格——墙上镶有十八世纪的护壁板，有镶嵌细工的桌子、精雕细刻的壁橱以及路易十五风格的器皿，器皿上蒙着路易十五时代的刺绣品。

“请相信我的话，老伙计，”他停顿了一下，然后继续说道，“天国是没有什么绝对平等的。”

说完，他不知怎么昏睡了过去。我坐下来，拿本书看。他一直昏睡不醒。到一点钟时，护士进来告诉我，说约瑟夫把午饭准备好了。见到约瑟夫，发现他一副服服帖帖的样子。

“想不到主教大人竟然亲自大驾光临了，这对我们可怜的主人是莫大的荣幸。你看见我吻他的戒指了吗？”

“看见了。”

“按说，我不会主动去吻的，那样做全是为了让我的妻子见了高兴。”

我在艾略特的房间里待了一下午。这期间，收到伊莎贝尔的一封电报，说她和格雷乘坐蓝色列车第二天上午抵达。我担心他们恐怕赶不上为艾略特送终了。医生来了，见了艾略特的状况直摇头。太阳落山时分，艾略特从昏睡中醒来，可以稍微吃点东西了。肚子里有了食，他似乎暂时有了些气力。他冲我招了招手，我走到了床边。只听他声音极其微弱地说：

“收到埃德娜的请帖，我还没有回信呢。”

“没关系，别管那些了，艾略特。”

“怎么能不管呢？在这个世界，我一直是个懂情理的人，不能因为就要离开这个世界，便置礼节于不顾。请帖在哪儿呢？”

请帖放在壁炉架上，我取来交到他手里，不过我觉得此时他是想看也看不清楚的。

“你去书房找几张信纸来。我口授，由你写回信。”

我走进隔壁的书房，把信纸拿了来，在他的床边坐下。

“你准备好了吗？”

“好了。”

他闭上眼睛，嘴边露出一丝顽皮的微笑。我心里纳闷，不知他会说出什么话来。

“鉴于之前和万能的主有约，恕艾略特·邓普顿无法接受诺威马里王妃善意的邀请。”

他淡淡地狞笑一声，脸色发青，看上去像鬼一样，呼出的气带有一种他这种病特有的恶臭味。可怜的艾略特，平时总是喜欢在身上洒点香水的呀，有时洒香奈儿牌的，有时洒慕尼丽丝牌的。他手里仍旧抓着那张我偷来的请帖。我觉得他那样拿着很不舒服，想从他手里取出来，谁知他紧紧抓住不放，大吼了一声，吓了我一跳。

“老淫妇！”

这是他留在人世间的最后一句话。话一出口，他便陷入了昏迷之中。昨天，护士守在病床旁熬了一夜，看上去疲倦极了，我让她去睡觉，答应在必要时叫她，由我来守夜。其实，守夜是无事可做的，于是我打开一盏带罩子的电灯看起书来，直至把眼睛看得发酸，这才将灯熄灭，坐在黑暗里休息。这是一个闷热的夜晚，窗户都大敞着。灯塔上的探照灯扫来扫去，每隔一段时间就会把光射进屋子里来。月亮隐去了身影，当月圆的时候来临时，就会看到埃德娜·诺威马里的化装舞会那热闹的场面，人声喧嚷却空虚乏味。此时，天空是一片深蓝色，星星多得数不清，一颗颗亮得惊人。我昏昏沉沉的，大概是进入了浅睡之中，但意识还是清醒的。突然，一种急促、愤怒的叫喊吓了我一跳，惊得我彻底醒了过来。那是临死之人发出的叫喊，令人毛骨悚然。我急忙走到病床边，借着灯塔上探照灯的光摸了摸他的脉搏，发现他已经死了。我打开床头灯看看他，见他下巴耷拉着，双目睁开。我静静地望着那双眼，过了一会儿才为他把眼合上。我感到很伤心，觉得有几滴眼泪顺双颊流了下来。一个老朋友，一个善良的老朋友就这么走了。想到他的一生是那么愚蠢、无益和无聊，我不由黯然神伤。他参加过许多宴会，跟王子、公爵、伯爵们举杯同饮，而今一切都化为乌有。那些人已欣然将他淡忘。

我不忍心叫醒那个已经累瘫了的护士，于是就回到窗旁，坐在我的椅子上睡着了。护士在早晨七点钟进来时，我仍在沉睡。醒来后，我丢下护士履行她的职责，自己去吃早餐，然后到车站接格雷和伊莎贝尔。我告诉他们，艾略特已经去世。由于艾略特的家里没有客房，我邀他们到我那儿去住，可他们愿意去住旅馆。我回到自己家中，洗过澡，刮了脸，然后换了身衣服。

这天上午，格雷打电话来，说约瑟夫交给他们一封信，信是写给我的，艾略特生前曾嘱咐由约瑟夫转交。由于这封信只能让我一个人看，于是我答应马上开车过去。不到一小时，我又走进了艾略特的家。那封信的信皮上写着：“我死后即刻转交，内含葬礼的安排。”我知道，他一心一意要葬在他造的那座教堂里，曾把此事对伊莎贝尔讲过。他希望将自己的遗体进行防腐处理，并说出了经营这项业务的公司的名称。“我打听过，”他在信里写道，“人人都说这家公司的防腐术十分高超。我委托你监督此事，一定要做好。下葬时，我要穿上我的祖先劳里亚伯爵的那套礼服，腰挎他的宝剑，胸前佩戴那个金羊毛勋章。至于挑选棺木，交给你决定，不要太招眼，但一定要符合我的身份。为了不给别人增添不必要的负担，遗体的转运事宜由托马斯·库克父子公司承办，让他们派个人护送棺木到下葬地去。”

记得艾略特曾经说过他要穿他那套豪华礼服下葬，当时以为他只是心血来潮，随便说说，没想到他竟然是认真的。约瑟夫坚持要按主人的遗愿办理，也就只好如此了。先是给他的遗体进行了防腐处理，然后我和约瑟夫去给他穿上那套荒唐的礼服。这件差事挺折磨人的。我们给他的长腿套上白绸长袜，再穿上那条金布紧身裤。随后，费了很大的气力把他的两条胳膊塞进紧身上衣的袖管里，给他戴上那浆洗好的宽大轮状绉领，再把锦缎斗篷给他披在肩上。最后，把那个平顶丝绒帽戴在他头上，把金羊毛的领圈围上他的脖子。遗体防腐公司的人在这之前曾给他的脸搽了胭脂，给他的嘴唇涂了口红。他如今骨瘦如柴，礼服穿在身上显得特别大，样子就像是威尔第[157]早期歌剧里的一名歌手，又像是为了没有价值的目标而奋斗的堂吉诃德。当殡葬承办人将他抬进棺材时，我把那柄作为道具的宝剑竖着放在他的两腿之间，让他的手按在剑柄的圆头上——我曾经见一个十字军骑士的墓碑雕塑像就是这种持剑的方式。

格雷和伊莎贝尔一路赶到了意大利去参加葬礼。





第六章


一


在此有必要敬告读者，完全可以跳过这一章，并不影响读者把握本书所叙述的故事脉络，因为这一章的大部分文字记载的基本上都是我和拉里的一次谈话。不过话又说回来，如果没有这次谈话，我觉得写这本书也就没有什么价值了。





二


话说那年秋天，在艾略特辞世两个月后，我前往英国，中途在巴黎逗留了一个星期。伊莎贝尔和格雷到意大利奔丧，之后又回到布列塔尼游览，此时已返回圣纪尧姆大街的公寓楼过起了小日子。伊莎贝尔把艾略特遗嘱的内容详细告诉了我，说他留下一笔钱给他造的那座教堂为他的灵魂做弥撒，另外还捐给教堂一笔维持费。他留给尼斯主教一笔数目可观的钱作为慈善捐献，留给我的则是那些意义暧昧的十八世纪的黄色书刊以及弗拉戈纳尔的一幅画，画面非常漂亮。在弗拉戈纳尔的这幅画里，森林之神在和一个女仙子干那种见不得人的事，由于色情味太浓，不便挂在墙上，而我又不是那种喜欢关上门偷看淫情绘画的人。他对家仆们很是大方，留下的钱不少。他的两个外甥各得一万块钱，余下的家产悉数给了伊莎贝尔。到底余下了多少家产，伊莎贝尔只字未提，我也没问。不过，从她心满意足的表情看来，这笔家产一定不是小数目。

格雷自从恢复健康之后，一直都在想着东山再起，急于返回美国重新工作。尽管伊莎贝尔在巴黎的日子过得很滋润，但格雷焦虑的心情也影响到了她。格雷和生意圈里的朋友沟通已有些时日，但真正的契机是他能够拿出一大笔钱作为资本。按说格雷本人是没有钱的，可是，艾略特给伊莎贝尔留下了一大笔遗产，数目远远超过他所需。所以，在取得伊莎贝尔的同意之后，他和那些人进行了谈判；如果一切进展顺利，他将离开巴黎，亲自实地考察。不过，在成行之前，有许多事情都需要料理。首先，他们必须在遗产税方面和法国财政部达成一项合理的协议。其次，需要处理掉安提比斯的别墅以及圣纪尧姆大街的公寓房。接下来，还得在德鲁奥旅馆筹备一次拍卖，处理掉艾略特的那些家具、藏画和素描。这些东西都是价值连城的宝贝，明智之举是等到来年春天再拍卖——那时，大收藏家们将云集巴黎。在巴黎过冬，伊莎贝尔并不觉得遗憾。两个孩子现在法语说得很棒，跟说英语一样流畅。伊莎贝尔倒是很愿意让她们在法国的学校里再上几个月的课。三年来，她们全长高了，长长的腿，瘦瘦的身体，小家伙们个个活泼可爱，虽然目前还没有母亲的那种天姿国色，却很懂礼貌，有着永不满足的好奇心。

当时的情况就是这样。





三


我和拉里相逢，纯属偶然。我曾经向伊莎贝尔打听过他，伊莎贝尔说自打从拉波勒归来，几乎再也没有见过他的面。她和格雷此时已有了自己的朋友圈，都是同一代的人，经常聚会，比我们四个人时常在一起时的那些快乐日子忙得多。一天傍晚，我去法兰西剧院看《贝蕾妮丝》。这个剧本我当然是读过的，却没看过它在戏台上的表演。由于这是难得一见的盛况，我哪能错过。该剧并非拉辛最优秀的作品，题材太单薄，不足以构成五幕剧，但情节感人肺腑，有几段可以说是脍炙人口。该剧是根据塔西佗[158]短短的一段历史史料虚构的，讲的是提多[159]和巴勒斯坦女王贝蕾妮丝的爱情故事。提多曾情迷贝蕾妮丝，甚至山盟海誓，要娶她为妻，可后来一登基当上皇帝，为了国家的利益，竟然违背自己的心愿，也不顾贝蕾妮丝的感情，将她送出了罗马城。这是因为元老院和罗马的人民都反对自己的皇帝和一个外国女王结合。剧本围绕着提多的心理斗争而展开——他徘徊于爱情和职责之间，难以抉择；贝蕾妮丝知道他爱自己，也理解他的处境，便永远地离开了他。

恐怕只有法国人能够充分欣赏拉辛飞扬的文采和词句里所包含的优美的音律。不过，即便是外国人，一旦熟悉了他那“戴假发”[160]的艺术风格，便不由得会为那种缱绻柔情和高尚情怀所打动。很少有人能像拉辛那样懂得台词里包含着多么感人的戏剧成分。我觉得他的那种流畅的亚历山大体[161]诗句足以弥补情节上的欠缺，剧中人的长篇宏论采用高超的处理手法将剧情推向预期的高潮，和电影里惊险的镜头一样扣人心弦。

第三幕演完后是幕间休息。我走出剧场到大厅里抽烟。那儿耸立着一尊出自于乌东[162]之手的伏尔泰雕像——伏尔泰咧着一张没有牙齿的嘴在讽刺地微笑。突然，有人在我的肩上拍了拍。我转过身去，感到有点气恼，因为我不愿受到打搅，只想独自享受那些精彩的台词给我的心里带来的喜悦。谁知竟是拉里！和往常一样，一见他，我感到由衷的高兴。有一年没见过面了。我提议戏剧散场后去喝上一杯。拉里说自己没吃晚饭，肚子饿了，建议看完戏后去蒙马特高地。剧终，我们俩又见了面，然后一起走到大街上。法兰西剧院有一种特殊的霉味，而这种霉味跟一代又一代女招待员身上的气味混杂在一起。这些女招待员很少洗澡，老是哭丧着脸，把观众领到座位前便赖着不走，硬等着观众给她们小费。从这样的地方走到外边呼吸新鲜的空气，会叫你感到浑身轻松。这是一个美好的夜晚，于是我们漫步走去。歌剧院大街的路灯亮晃晃的，显得傲气十足，天上的群星好像不屑跟它们争奇斗艳，于是便将自身的光华隐匿在了无边无际的黑暗之中。我们一边走，一边谈论着刚才看的戏。拉里感到失望。他倒是希望演戏能演得自然一些，说台词就像平时说话一样，姿势没必要那么过于戏剧化。而我认为他的观点是错误的。该剧以辞藻胜，而且使用华丽的辞藻，所以我觉得说台词就应该拿腔拿调的。我喜欢演员在遇到韵脚时便顿一下加以强调，喜欢他们那格式化的姿势——这种形式有着悠久的历史，是传承下来的传统，似乎很适合于这种偏重形式的艺术格调。我敢说，拉辛一定会愿意让自己的剧本以这种形式加以表演。在重重的限制之下，演员们却能发挥自己的才能，演出了人情味，演出了炽热的感情，真是叫我折服。艺术把传统拿来己用，为的是实现自身的目的——这是艺术之胜利。

我们到了克利希大街，走进格拉夫餐馆。餐馆里人满为患，不过，我们还是找到了一张桌子，点了鸡蛋和火腿。我告诉拉里，说我见到伊莎贝尔了。

“能回到美国去，格雷会非常高兴的。”他说道，“在这儿，他就像是鱼儿离开了水。除非能重返职场，否则他不会快活的。我敢说，他一定能挣很多钱。”

“如果他能成功，也都是亏了你。你不但治愈了他的身体，也治愈了他的心灵。你使他恢复了自信。”

“这是雕虫小技。我只不过向他展示一种方法，让他自我救治。”

“这个雕虫小技你是怎么学来的呢？”

“完全得之于偶然。当时我在印度，正遭受失眠之苦。一次，我把此事给自己认识的一个老瑜伽师随便提了一下，谁知他说马上为我治疗。他的治疗方法就跟你看见我给格雷治病的方法是一样的。结果，那天夜里我睡得很好——我已经很长时间没能睡得那么香了。后来，大概是在一年之后吧，我和一位印度朋友爬喜马拉雅山，他把脚给崴了。跟前找不到医生，他疼得要死。我心想不妨照那个老瑜伽师的办法试一试，谁知竟然奏效了。不管你相信不相信，他的疼痛彻底消失了。”说到此处，拉里哈哈大笑，“我可以向你保证，我当时比任何人都感到意外。其实，没有什么神秘的，你只不过把想法输入到病人的脑子里罢了。”

“说起来容易，做起来难。”

“如果你的胳膊不由自主地从桌子上抬起来，你会感到意外吗？”

“非常意外。”

“情况就是这样。那次回到文明世界后，我的那个印度朋友把我妙手回春的本事告诉了人们，并带了一些病人来。我坚决不愿意出手，因为我压根就不知道那到底是怎么回事，可他们硬缠着我不放。后来，我鬼使神差地竟然把他们全治好了。我发现自己不但能治愈病痛，而且能驱除恐惧。奇怪的是，许多人都患有恐惧症，不是怕幽闭、怕高，而是怕死，更为糟糕的是怕活着。他们往往看上去好像身体健康、事业发达，无忧无虑的，其实深受恐惧症的折磨。有时我心想这恐怕是一种最恼人的心理状况，怀疑它是一种根深蒂固的动物本能，是人类从第一次感到生命战栗的原始生物那儿继承来的。”

他很少说这么多的话，我一边听，一边心里暗暗希望他继续说下去。我有一种感觉——他总算把话匣子打开了。也许，方才看的那出戏剧解除了他的部分戒心，剧中人字正腔圆、抑扬顿挫的台词像音乐一般影响了他的情绪，使得他克服了天生的拘谨。突然间，我感到自己的手发生了变化。刚才对拉里那半开玩笑的提问并没有在意，现在我却觉察到自己的手已不再放在桌面上了，而是不由自主地抬起，离开桌面有一英寸的样子。我吃了一惊，瞧了瞧它，发现它微微有点颤抖。我觉得胳膊上的神经有点发麻，感到它抽搐了一下，随后，手和小臂自己就抬了起来。我干脆听之任之，既不帮助也不抑制。它们离桌面有好几英寸，最后，整条胳膊举过了肩头。

“这真是太奇怪了。”我说道。

拉里哈哈大笑。我稍稍用意志加以控制，那只手便落回到了桌面上。

“雕虫小技，”他说，“不必当真。”

“你刚从印度回来时曾跟我们提到过一位瑜伽师。这一套是不是他教给你的？”

“哦，不是他教的。他才没有耐心理会这种事情呢。一些瑜伽师自称具有神力，我不知他是否也有这种自信心，但有一点是明确的——他觉得这般卖弄是幼稚之举。”

说话间，我们点的鸡蛋和火腿送来了。我们狼吞虎咽吃了起来，一边还喝着啤酒，谁都没有再说话。我不知他在想什么，而我的心里则在思索着他的情况。饭后，我点起一根纸烟，他则抽他的烟斗。

“当初你为什么要去印度？”我冷不丁问道。

“上天的安排。至少我当时是这么想的。现在我倒觉得自己在欧洲多年，到那儿去是一种必然结果。对我影响至深的人，似乎只是偶然相遇，而今回想起来，则好像有着很大的必然性。他们仿佛一直在等着我，等着我在必要的时候和他们相逢。我去印度，是因为我的身心需要得到休息——多年来，我孜孜以求，渴望理清自己的思绪。我登上一艘周游世界的豪华游轮，在甲板上当服务生，开往东方，又穿过巴拿马运河驶向纽约。五年未回美国了，思乡情油然而生。多年前你我初次相遇于芝加哥时，你也知道我当时是多么无知。到了欧洲，我读书破万卷，目睹世间千般变化，但离我上下求索的目标仍相去甚远。”

我原想问问他究竟是什么目标，却又觉得他肯定会付之一笑，耸耸肩，回说不值得一提。

“你也不缺钱，为什么要到游轮上打工呢？”我转而问道。

“我想体验一下生活嘛。一旦心里出现饱和状态，想读书也读不进去时，我发现换换环境大有益处。我和伊莎贝尔解除婚约的那年冬天，我曾到兰斯那儿下煤窑，干了有半年的时间。”

他就是在这个时候讲述了那段经历，此事已在前边的一章里做过交代。

“伊莎贝尔跟你分手，你心里难过吗？”

在回答之前，他打量着我，把我看了一会儿——他的眼睛出奇的黑，似乎不是在看我，而是在看他的内心深处。

“是的。我那时年轻，太重感情。之前，我一门心思要跟她结婚，曾经做出了规划，要和她共度人生，期望生活美满。”说到这里，他淡然一笑，“吵架是一个巴掌拍不响，结婚也是这个道理，得有两个人参与才行。万万没想到，我给伊莎贝尔提供的生活竟会叫她大失所望。我如果懂得一点人情世故的话，就不应该那样做。她年轻，热爱生活。我不能怪她，但我自己也不愿委曲求全。”

读者可能还记得，他和那个农场主守寡的儿媳发生了不干不净的关系之后，便仓皇逃跑，取道去了波恩。我急于听他说下去，却情知必须当心，尽量不问敏感的问题。

“我没去过波恩，”我说道，“小的时候，我倒是在海德堡上过学。那恐怕是我一生中最快乐的时候了。”

我喜欢波恩，在那儿住了有一年的时间。我是住在波恩大学的一个教授遗孀家里，租赁了他们家的一个房间。他们家平时老住着一两个房客。遗孀有二女，均已步入中年，负责烹饪和操持家务。另有一个房客是法国人。起初我有点失望，因为我只想练德语，不愿说别的语言。不过后来发现他是个阿尔萨斯人[163]，操一口德语——他的德语即便不如他的法语说得流畅，其语音语调也胜于他的法语。他的穿着像个牧师。几天后，我意外地得知他竟然是个本笃会[164]修士。他获得修道院的批准，来波恩大学的图书馆搞研究工作。他是个知识渊博的人，但表面上看和我心目中的修士并无两样。他高个子，体格魁梧，沙色的头发，一双蓝眼睛炯炯有神，脸儿又红又圆。他生性腼腆，有点拘谨，似乎不愿意跟我多说话。不过，他非常懂礼貌，处事周到，一道进餐时总是客客气气的。只有在吃饭时，才能见上他的面。午饭一完，他就回图书馆工作；吃过晚饭，他则一头钻进他自己的房间，而我坐在客厅里跟寡妇的一个女儿聊天（另一个女儿在洗碗），练习说德语。

这样至少过了有一个月，一天下午，他问我愿不愿意和他出去散步，这倒叫我颇感意外。他说可以带我在附近走走，有些地方靠我自己找是找不到的。我是个很能走的人，而他更能走，让我甘拜下风。第一次散步，我们走了足足有十五英里。他问我来波恩干什么，我说来学德文，并且想熟悉一下德国文学。他的谈吐充满了智慧。他说他会尽其所能地帮助我。那以后，我们每星期都要出去散两三次步。我得知他是教哲学的，已有些年头了。在巴黎时，我读过一些哲学著作，斯宾诺莎的，柏拉图的，也有笛卡儿的，而德国那些大哲学家的著作我却一本也没有读过。能听他讲讲德国的哲学家，令我喜出望外。一天，我们到莱茵河对岸去散步，坐在一个酒庄里喝啤酒，他问我是不是新教徒。

‘也算是吧。’我回答说。

“他飞快地扫了我一眼，我觉得他的眼睛里闪出一丝笑意。接下来，他便谈论起埃斯库罗斯[165]。你知道我是学过希腊语的，可是他对古希腊悲剧作家的了解之深，是我望尘莫及的。听他谈古论今，叫我茅塞顿开。只是一点令我不解，不知道他为何突然问我是不是新教徒。我的监护人纳尔逊叔叔是个不可知论者，但他照样去做礼拜，因为他的病人期望他这样做。他送我上主日学校，也是出自同样的考虑。我们家的女佣玛莎是一个不折不扣的浸礼会教徒。我小的时候，她老给我讲地狱之火的故事，说罪人将被送进地狱受罚，永无宁日，听得我心惊胆战。她和村里的一些人因为某种原因有了过节，她便诅咒他们，绘声绘色地向我描述那些人在地狱之火里怎样经受痛苦的折磨，从中获得快感。

时至冬日，我对恩斯海姆神父已经有了相当深的了解，觉得他是个十分了不起的人。我从未见他跟谁生过气。他总是那样的温和、善良，胸襟之开阔超出我的想象，待人宽容大度。他博学多闻，我是几斤几两他肯定心中有数，但对待我却好像我跟他一样有学问似的。对我，他从不缺乏耐心，似乎别无所图，只求为我效力。一天，不知怎么，我的腰突然疼了起来。女房东格雷博夫人硬要我上床休息，用热水袋暖一暖。恩斯海姆神父听说我卧病在床，晚饭后跑来看我。除了腰疼得厉害，我感觉身体还是挺好的。你也知道，但凡书虫，对于书都有着特别强烈的兴趣。我原来正在看书，见他进来，就把书放下了。他拿起那本书，看了看书名。那是一本介绍迈斯特·埃克纳特的书，是我在城里的一个书摊买来的。他问我为什么看这种书，我说自己曾经涉猎过一些有关神秘主义的著作，并且和他谈到考斯迪以及考斯迪是怎样引起我对神秘主义产生兴趣的。他用那双炯炯有神的蓝眼睛打量着我，眼睛里有一种神情——那种神情只能被解读为温情。他一定觉得我很可笑，竟然看这种书，但还会照样喜欢我的，绝不会因此而减弱他对我的感情。至于别人是不是把我看得有点蠢，我反正历来都是不在乎的。

‘看这种书，你想寻找什么呢？’他问我。

‘我要是知道的话，’我回答，‘就直接去寻找了。’

‘我曾经问你是不是新教徒，还记得吗？你说你还算是个新教徒，这是什么意思？’

‘我从小就是被当作新教徒教养的。’我答道。

‘你相信上帝吗？’他问。

“我不喜欢别人问我的私事，所以一冲动，想让他别管闲事。可是见他满脸的和善，我就不忍心顶撞他了。我左右为难，不知是该说相信好，还是说不相信好。后来也可能是腰疼让我忘记了自己的底线，要不然就是因为他身上的某样东西感动了我。反正我开口讲述了我的人生经历。”

说到此处，拉里停顿了一下，当他再次拾起话头时，我感觉他不是在对我讲话，而是在向那个本笃会修士陈述了。他忘记了我在跟前。不知是因为时间的关系还是地点的影响，反正他一吐为快，不用我催促，将一直压在心头的事情讲了出来。

鲍勃·纳尔逊叔叔很民主，送我进的是马文中学。后来架不住路易莎·布雷德利伯母的再三劝说，到了我十四岁时，他让我进了圣保罗中学。无论是功课还是体育，我都不怎么行，只是勉强过得去。我觉得自己那时是个十分正常的孩子，对飞行特别着迷。那时候，飞行还处在早期阶段，鲍勃叔叔和我一样，一提起飞行便激动不已。他认识几个飞行员；当我说想要学飞行时，他就说愿意为我想办法。我年纪虽小，个子却长得高，十六岁就完全可以冒充十八岁了。鲍勃叔叔叮嘱我务必保守秘密，因为他明白一旦邻里知道他让我去当飞行员，一定会招来铺天盖地的谴责。其实，是他帮助我跑到加拿大，给我一封介绍信去见他的一位熟人。结果，我十七岁就已经翱翔于法国的蓝天了。

“那时候，我们驾驶的飞机都是些廉价的破烂货，每次飞上天都是玩命。那时的飞行高度，拿现在的标准衡量，简直低得可笑。可我们又不知道这些，只知道那感觉美妙极了。我爱飞行，真不知该如何形容当时的感受，只觉得内心自豪和幸福。在天上，飞得高高的，周围广阔无垠、美不胜收，而自己就是其中的一个部分。不明白是什么原因，反正到了两千英尺的高度，我就感到不再孤独了，不再是一个人独处了，而是有所属了。这话听上去有点蠢，但这的确是我当时的感受。飞翔在高空，脚下有朵朵的白云，那白云就像是一大群绵羊一样。我恬然自得，觉得自己和无限的空间已融为一体。”

拉里停了一下，目光从他那深不可测的眼窝里盯着我。真不知他是看我还是看别处。

“我知道有成千上万的人死于非命，但我没有亲眼所见，故而对我影响不大。后来亲眼见一个人战死，我心里感到非常惋惜。”

“惋惜？”我情不自禁地脱口而出。

“说惋惜，那是因为他是个小伙子，比我才大上三四岁，生龙活虎的，天不怕地不怕。转眼间，一个精力充沛、心地善良的人就变成了一具血肉模糊的躯体，看上去好像从未有过生命似的。”

我没有说什么。我学过医，死人见多了，战争中见的更是多得不计其数。令我沮丧的是，人一死就一钱不值了，没有一丁点人的尊严，就像废弃不用的木偶。

那天夜里我睡不着觉，暗暗地流着眼泪。我并不是为自身的安全感到恐惧，而是觉得气愤，为战争的罪恶感到痛心。战争结束后，我回到了家乡。我一直都很喜欢机械，如果不能再飞行了，我打算进汽车厂工作。我受过伤，所以工作的事不便操之过急。后来，他们要我就业，而我不愿接受他们为我选择的职业。他们的努力无果而终。我曾经花费过大量时间思考问题，不断地问自己，人活着究竟是为了什么？从战争的硝烟中我侥幸活了下来，一心想让自己的人生有意义，但又不知道怎么才能有意义。以前我不太考虑上帝这类问题，而此时我开始苦苦思索。我不明白世界上为什么会有罪恶。我知道自己非常无知，又苦于找不到能够请教的人。我渴望寻找到答案，于是便一头钻进了书堆里。

当我把这些心事讲给恩斯海姆神父听时，他便问我：‘你读书读了有四年了吧？那么你找到答案了吗？’

‘没有找到。’我回答说。

他望着我，神情和蔼、慈祥。我都糊涂了，不知道自己做了什么，竟值得他如此器重。他用手指在桌子上轻轻敲打着，仿佛在考虑着一项决策。

‘我们大智大慧的教会认为，’他启口说道，‘假如你信其有，那才可能成真；假如你祈祷时心存疑虑，但态度虔诚，疑虑便会烟消云散。经许多个世纪的实践证明，礼拜仪式对人的精神影响很大，如果你愿意参加这种仪式，内心一定会感到安宁。我不久就要回修道院去了。何不跟我一起走，在那儿待上几个星期？你可以和修士们一道下地干活，也可以在我们的图书馆里看书。这样的体验恐怕比你下煤窑或者在一个德国农场上务工更有意义。’

‘你为什么提这样的建议？’我问。

‘我观察你已有三个月了，’他说，‘也许，我比你自己更了解你。你和你的信仰之间仅隔着一层纸，一捅就破。’

我对他的建议未置可否。我有一种奇怪的感觉，就好像有人拨弄了一下我的心弦。末了，我说我会考虑的。此话题他搁下不再提起。此后，恩斯海姆神父在波恩又待了一段时间，我们再没有谈及与宗教有关的事情。可是，他临离开波恩时，给我留下了修道院的地址，说如果我打定主意要去，不妨给他写信告知，他将为我做出安排。他走后，我没想到自己会那么思念他。日子一天天过去，转眼便到了仲夏时节。我喜欢在波恩消夏，读了很多人的著作，有歌德的、席勒的、海涅的、荷尔德林[166]的以及里尔克[167]的。可是，从他们的书中，我没有找到答案。期间，我经常考虑恩斯海姆神父的建议。最后，我决定接受他的邀请。

恩斯海姆神父前往车站接我。修道院位于阿尔萨斯的乡间，风光旖旎。他把我介绍给了院长，然后领我去那个拨给我住的小房间。里面有一架狭窄的铁床，墙上挂着耶稣受难像，陈设简陋，只有些生活必需的东西。吃饭铃响时，我向食堂走去。那是一个有着圆顶的大厅。院长率两个修士候在门口，一个修士端一盆水，另一修士手拿一条毛巾。院长在来宾手上洒几滴水，算是洗了手，然后用一位修士递过来的毛巾为之擦干。除了我，另外还有三个来宾——有两个是路过的牧师，留下来吃顿饭，还有一个满腹牢骚的法国老人，是来修道院过隐居生活的。

院长和两个助手，一正一副，在餐厅的上首就座，各自占一张桌子；修士们在沿墙的两边坐，见习修士和勤杂人员以及客人们则坐在餐厅正中。做了感恩祷告之后，大家就吃了起来。一个见习修士在餐厅进口处站定，以一种单调的声音诵读一册训导书。吃完饭，大家又做感恩祷告。院长、恩斯海姆神父、来宾以及负责接待来宾的修士，进入一个小房间喝咖啡，谈了些日常事务。然后，我回到了自己的房间。

“我在那儿住了三个月，日子过得快快活活的。那种生活很适合我。修道院的图书馆很棒，我看了不少书。修士们没有一个企图以任何方法影响我，但是，很高兴和我交谈。他们的学识、虔诚的态度以及超凡脱俗的气质，给我留下了深刻的印象。你不要以为他们过的是一种无所事事的生活。其实，他们时时都在忙碌。他们自耕自种，我偶尔下田相助，叫他们感到由衷的高兴。我喜欢做祈祷时的那种壮观场面，最喜欢的则是晨祷。晨祷是在清晨四点钟进行的。坐在教堂里，周围漆黑一团，修士们身穿神秘的晨祷服，头巾遮在头上，用铿锵的男音唱着礼拜仪式的歌曲，真是动人心弦。修道院的日常生活规律性很强，能起到安神定心的作用。尽管你充满了活力，尽管你的思想一刻也不停止，但你的心里一片静谧。”

说到这里，拉里苦笑了一下。

跟罗拉一样，我可真是生不逢时呀。要是出生在中世纪就好了，因为那时候宗教信仰是铁定的事，我会觉得自己的人生之路清清楚楚，只要加入教会就可以了。现在让我信教便难了。我渴望信仰上帝，但做不到，因为上帝比普通的正人君子强不到哪里去。修士们告诉我，说上帝创造世界是为了彰显自身的荣耀。这在我看来并不是什么值得称道的目标。贝多芬创作交响乐难道是为了彰显自身的荣耀吗？我相信不是的。我认为他创作是因为他内心回荡着音乐，需要他表现出来，而他竭尽其能，努力把这些音乐表现得尽善尽美。

“我常听修士们一遍遍地念主祷文，就不明白他们为什么要苦苦地祈求天父赐给他们每日的口粮呢。难道孩子们还需要祈求他们尘世的父亲给他们提供食物吗？孩子们指望着父亲供养，不会因此而感激他，也没必要那样做。对于一个只生孩子不养孩子的父亲，我们只会加以谴责。在我看来，如果万能的造物主无心给自己创造的众生提供他们赖以生存的物质粮食和精神粮食，那还不如不创造得好。”

“亲爱的拉里，”我说道，“幸好你没有出生在中世纪，否则，你毫无疑问会被处死的。”

他听后笑了。

“你取得了辉煌的成就，”他继续说道，“难道你愿意让别人当面颂扬你吗？”

“那只会叫我尴尬。”

这一点上咱们是英雄所见略同。上帝恐怕也不愿意听奉承话。想当初在空军里服役时，有个家伙对上司溜须拍马，弄上个肥差，结果遭到大家的鄙视。假如靠着阿谀谄媚以求获得‘拯救’，那么，也会遭到上帝鄙视的。依我看来，尽自己的一份力量积德行善最合上帝的心意。

不过，最叫我想不通的还不是这个。对于什么是罪恶有着种种偏见，据我所知，那些修士们就多少带有偏见，而我对他们的看法不能苟同。我在空军里结识了许多人，有的一喝酒就喝个烂醉，有的玩女人，有的满嘴脏话；飞行员里也有害群之马——一个家伙因开空头支票被抓住，判了六个月的刑。也不能全怪那个‘害群之马’——他以前囊空如洗，做梦都想不到能弄到那么多钱，一下子便冲昏了头脑。在巴黎，我遇到过一些坏人，回芝加哥时见到的就更多了。一般来说，他们的劣根性来自于遗传，他们也是身不由己呀；有的则是受到环境的影响而变坏的，这一点上他们是没有选择的——对此，社会恐怕得负更大的责任。如果我是上帝，对于这些坏人，哪怕是罪大恶极的，也不会不分青红皂白地加以惩罚，把他们打入十八层地狱。恩斯海姆神父胸襟开阔，认为所谓的地狱就是失去了上帝护佑的地方。话又说回来，假如下地狱是一种令人难以忍受的惩罚，那么你想想，仁慈的上帝会加以施行吗？归根结底，人类可是他一手创造的。如果说他创造的人类有可能去犯罪，那么，他就难辞其咎。如果有陌生人进我家的后院，我驯养的狗扑上去咬他，而我将狗打一顿，那便有失公允了。

如果说是大慈大悲、无所不能的上帝创造了这个世界，那他何必又要创造出罪恶来呢？按照修士们的说法，一个人只有克服内心的邪念，抵御诱惑，接受上帝的考验，经历痛苦、悲伤和灾难，使自己变得纯洁，才有资格接受上帝的恩典。这就像是派个人去送信，却在路上布一个迷宫，让他难以通过，再挖一条壕沟，逼他泅水而过，最后筑一道高墙，逼他攀爬。我不相信一个大智大慧的上帝会出如此下策。依我之见，还不如信仰一个普通的上帝——这个上帝不是致力于创造世界，而是致力于改善现状；与人类相比，他无比善良、智慧和伟大，和那些并非他创造的罪恶不懈地斗争，最终取得胜利。不过，话又说回来，世人究竟为何信仰现在的这个上帝，我心里也是一本糊涂账。

无论是在理智上还是在感情上，这些问题让我十分纠结，而那些好心的修士却无法为我解答。我和他们显然不是一条道上跑的车。我向恩斯海姆神父辞别时，他满脸慈祥地望着我。他一定认为我在修道院获益匪浅，想问一声，却没有问出口。

‘恐怕我让你失望了，恩斯海姆神父。’我说道。

“‘哪里的话。’他回答，‘你是个宗教修养很深的人，目前不信上帝，而上帝以后会把你挑选出来的。你一定会回来的。至于回到这儿来，还是到别的修道院去，只有上帝能够决断。’”

“我到巴黎住下来，在那儿度过了残冬。我对科学知识一无所知，后来觉得该了解了解科学了，至少得掌握一点常识吧。于是，我读了不少相关的书。我也不知道自己学到了多少知识，只觉得自己十分孤陋寡闻。若说这一点，我老早就有自知之明了。春天姗姗来临，我到乡间去，在傍河而建的一个客栈里住下来，不远处有一座美丽的法式古镇——那儿的生活平静如水，似乎两百年没有起过波澜。”

我猜想那年夏天拉里是和苏姗娜·鲁维埃一起度过的。不过，我没有打断他的话。

“后来，我去了西班牙，想看看委拉斯凯兹[168]和埃尔·格列柯的画。我觉得，宗教不能给我提供答案，也许艺术可以为我指出一条路吧。我浪迹天涯，四处游荡，最后去了塞维利亚。我喜欢那地方，打算在那儿过冬。”

我二十三岁那年也去过塞维利亚，也喜欢那地方。我喜欢那弯弯曲曲白颜色的街道，喜欢那教堂以及瓜达尔基维尔河畔一望无际的平原。我还喜欢那些安达卢西亚姑娘，她们一个个风韵十足、活泼可爱，黑色的眸子闪闪发亮，头上插一朵康乃馨，把一头黑发衬托得如乌云一般，而康乃馨显得愈加艳丽。她们美丽的肤色以及诱人、性感的嘴唇令人着迷。是呀，那时候年轻，觉得自己到了天堂。拉里到那儿去的时候，比我当年大不了许多。我不由心想，见了那些迷人的姑娘，他不可能无动于衷。他以下说的话解答了我心里的疑问。

我遇见了一个在巴黎就认识的画家，名叫奥古斯特·科迪特，此人曾经和苏姗娜·鲁维埃同居过。他来到塞维利亚写生，勾搭上一个女孩子，两个人就住在了一起。有天晚上他请我和他们一道去埃里丹尼亚剧院听一位弗拉明戈[169]歌唱家演唱，把他情妇的闺密也带了去。那个闺密有沉鱼落雁的容貌，年仅十八岁。她跟一个小伙子闯了祸，有了身孕，不得不离开了自己的村子。那个小伙子正在服兵役。她将孩子生下来后交给奶妈照料，自己进了一家烟草厂打工。我把她带回了我的住处。她活泼可爱，非常招人喜欢。过了几天，我问她愿意不愿意跟我在一起生活。她回答说愿意。于是，我们在一家旅馆[170]租了两个房间，里面有寝室和客厅。我让她辞去工作，可是她老大不愿意。这倒也好，因为这样一来，白天我可以用来做些事情。我们自己开火做饭。她上班前准备好早餐，中午回来做午饭，晚饭我们则下馆子，吃完饭就去看电影或者跳舞。她把我看作疯子，因为我洗过一次蒸汽浴，而且每天早晨坚持用海绵蘸冷水擦身子。她把孩子寄养在一个村子里，离塞维利亚有几英里的路程，我们常在星期天去看孩子。她跟我同居是想积攒些钱，等她的男友服完兵役回来，他们就租套房，好用这些钱装修房子，对此她毫不隐瞒。她是个招人疼的小可爱，将来一定能成为她的心上人帕克的好妻子。她整天乐呵呵的，性格温和，懂得情意。她把人们讳莫如深的性交视为身体的自然功能，与身体别的功能是一样的。她从性交中获得欢乐，也乐得给别人带来欢乐。在床上，她活像一头小兽，不过却是一头善良、迷人、温和的小兽。

后来，一天晚上，她告诉我，说她收到帕克从西属摩洛哥（他服兵役的地方）寄来一封信，信中说他就要复员了，两天内将抵达加的斯。第二天早上，她把自己的东西打了包，把钱塞在长袜子里，让我送她上车站。当我把她送上车厢时，她热烈地吻了我。一想到就要和自己久别的心上人重逢，她兴奋不已，早已没有心情跟我话别。我很肯定，不等火车开出车站，她就会把我忘到九霄云外。

“她走后，我继续留在塞维利亚，直至秋天来临，然后就踏上了前往印度的旅程。”

时间已经很晚了。客人们纷纷离去。只有几张桌子旁还坐着人。那些没有事做来消磨时间的人都回家去了。那些看完戏剧或电影跑来小酌或垫补肚子的人，也已经离去。时不时会有几个夜猫子晃晃悠悠走进来。这时，只见一个高个子（一看就知道是个英国人）和一个小混混走了进来。此人像是个英国的知识分子，有一张马脸，面色苍白，一头鬈发，已开始谢顶。他跟许多人一样有一种幻想症，总以为一到了国外，以前的熟人就认不出他来了。小混混在狼吞虎咽地吃一大盘三明治，而他在一旁观看，脸上带着喜悦和慈祥的神情。真是好胃口呀！在食客中，我看见了一张熟悉的面孔，认出那人在尼斯时和我去同一家理发店理过发。那是个大胖子，上了点年纪，头发花白，有一张虚肿的红脸，眼睛下是两个大眼袋。他是美国中西部的一个银行家，经济大崩溃之后离开了故乡，不愿面对政府部门的调查。不知道他是否犯了罪，即便犯了罪，在法国当局眼里也是小鱼小虾，犯不着引渡他。他摆出一副高傲的架势，像低级政客那样装出君子相，然而眼睛里却含着惊恐和忧郁。他总是浑浑噩噩，一副半醉半醒的样子。他经常跟妓女鬼混，而那些人恨不得榨光他的油水。此刻，有两个涂脂抹粉的中年女子跟他在一起，对他冷嘲热讽，毫不掩饰心里的蔑视。对于她们的话，他也仅仅能听懂一半，只顾嘿嘿嘿地傻笑。这就是风月场上的世态炎凉！他还真不如留在国内，咽下自己酿的苦酒。那些女人总有一天会把他榨干的。到那时候，他将无路可走，只好投河或者服安眠药自杀了。

在深夜两点和三点之间，客人有所增加，大概是因为那些夜总会打烊的缘故。一伙美国小青年大摇大摆走了进来，一个个喝得醉醺醺，又喊又叫，不过，他们坐了一会儿就滚蛋了。离我们不远处有两个胖女人，并排坐在一起，身上紧绷绷地穿着男式衣服，阴沉着脸，一声不吭地在喝闷酒。来了一群穿晚礼服的人——这类人在法语里叫作世界公民[171]。他们显然东游西逛了一天，此刻跑来吃夜宵，给自己的一天画个句号。他们来了，后来又走了。有个小个子男人，穿着朴素，面前放了一杯啤酒，坐在那儿看报有一个多小时了，我见了不由起了好奇之心。他留了一撮整齐的黑胡子，戴着夹鼻眼镜。最后，终于有个女子走了进来，和他坐在了一起。他冲女子点点头，冷冷淡淡的，八成是因为女子叫他久等，惹他生气了。女子年轻，穿着寒碜，浓妆艳抹，倦容满面。过不久，我看见女子从手提包里取出一样东西递给了他，那是一些钱。男子看了看那钱，脸上布满了阴云，随即说了一通话。我听不见他说的是什么，但从女子的表情看，猜想一定是骂她的。而她说了几句话，像是在为自己开脱。冷不丁，男子欠过身去，给了她一记响亮的耳光。她先是惊叫一声，随后抽抽搭搭哭起来。老板听见哭声，急忙跑上前查看情况。他好像在警告他们，叫他们注意自己的言行，否则就赶他们出去。女子冲着这位老板发作起来，嘴里不干不净地骂他，叫他少管闲事，由于嗓门高，每句话都可以听得清清楚楚。

“他扇我耳光，那是我罪有应得！”她高声嚷嚷道。

女人啊，女人！过去我一直认为，要靠女人卖淫吃饭，你必须膀大腰圆，像恶煞神一般，还得讨异性的喜欢，动刀动枪是家常便饭。而眼前的这个家伙又低又矮，看样子像是律师事务所的一个小职员，竟然能在这人满为患的行业里占有一席之地，不能不叫人感到意外。

伺候我们这张桌子的侍者要下班，急于拿到小费，便将账单送了过来。我们付了钱，又要了两杯咖啡。

“后来怎么样了？”我问道。

我觉得拉里有意要说，而我有心想听。

“你没有听烦吗？”

“没有。”

后来，我们的船去了孟买，在那儿停留三天，让旅客们上岸游览风光或者做短途旅行。第三天下午，我不值班，于是上岸瞎转悠，东瞧瞧西看看。那儿人山人海，什么人都有——中国人、伊斯兰教徒、印度教徒以及肤色像你的帽子一样黑的泰米尔人。身躯庞大的公牛拉着车行走在大街上，一个个驼着背，头上的犄角老长！我还去了一趟象岛，参观了那儿的石窟。轮船行驶到亚历山大城的时候，曾有一个印度人上了船，是到孟买去的。乘客们都有些瞧不起他。他是个矮胖子，圆脸庞，棕色皮肤，穿一套黑绿两色格子的厚花呢衣服，围一条牧师的领子。有天晚上，我来到甲板上想透透气，他走过来跟我搭话。当时，我不想和任何人说话，只想自己待着。他连珠炮似的问了我一大堆问题，我却爱答不理。我告诉他，说我是个学生，来船上打工，挣点盘缠回美国去。

‘你应该在印度待一待，’他说，‘西方有许多需要向东方学习的东西，多得超出了西方人的想象。’

‘是吗？’我说。

“‘不管怎样，’他继续说道，‘象岛的石窟你是必须要去看的。你一定会不虚此行。’”

拉里讲到此处，停下来问了我一个问题：

“你去过印度吗？”

“没去过。”

后来我就去了象岛，站在那儿观看三头神巨像——那是岛上极为壮观的一景，心里在琢磨着它代表着什么。忽听身后有人说道：‘看来，你接受了我的建议。’我转过脸去，定了定神才认出了说话的人是谁——他就是那个穿厚花呢衣服、戴牧师领子的小个子。此时，他却穿一袭橘黄色长袍——事后我才知道，那是罗摩克里希纳教派[172]的长老所穿的衣服。他已经不再是先前那个滑里滑稽、叽叽喳喳爱说话的小矮子了，而成了一个气宇轩昂的人物。我们俩都在观看那尊巨像。

‘一个是大梵天，司创造；’他说，‘一个是毗湿奴，司护持；还有一个是湿婆，司破坏。这三大神代表的是终极境界。’

‘我怕是听不懂你说什么。’我说道。

“‘这一点也不奇怪。’他嘴角带着一丝笑意回答道，同时挤了一下眼，仿佛在嘲笑我，你要是能吃得透上帝，那他就不是上帝了。谁又能解释得清什么是”无极呢？

他双手合十，微微鞠了一躬，然后便扬长而去了。我待在原地继续观望那三个神秘的头像。我有一种醍醐灌顶的感觉，心里异常兴奋。你知道，有时候你回忆一个人的名字，那名字都到了嘴边了，可你就是叫不出来。我当时的感觉就是如此。出了石窟，我坐在台阶上瞭望大海，在那儿坐了很长时间。关于婆罗门教，我所有的知识都来自于爱默生的几句诗。我绞尽脑汁想把那几句诗背出来，但就是做不到，让我感到很恼火。回到孟买，我钻进一家书店，想看看有哪个诗集收入了那几句诗，结果在《牛津英诗选》里找到了它们。你能背得下来吗？

不把我放在心上，那是痴心妄想；

他们要飞翔，我就是翅膀；

我是怀疑者，也是怀疑的思想，

婆罗门唱圣歌把我颂扬。

我在当地的一家餐馆吃了晚饭。由于只要十点钟之前回到轮船上即可，于是我便信步走上广场溜达，从那儿眺望大海。天上繁星点点，多得前所未见。热了一整天，此时凉爽宜人。我找到一个公园，在长凳上坐下。公园里漆黑一团，不时有白乎乎的身影默默地从我旁边走过。白天的天气晴朗，阳光灿烂，人群熙攘，身着五颜六色服装，空气中弥漫着辛辣而芳香的东方气味，令我心醉神迷。大梵天、毗湿奴和湿婆三头巨像就像是画家的画龙点睛之笔，抹上这一笔色彩，使得画面趋于完整，并带来了一种神秘的气息。我的心狂跳不已——我突然强烈地感受到，印度要赠送给我一件礼物，我必须收下。这是个千载难逢的机会，一旦失去，就永远也不会再有了。我当机立断，决定不回轮船上去了，反正我也没有什么贵重的东西在那儿，旅行包里只装了几件零碎物件。我缓步向居民区走去，想找家旅馆住下。旅馆很快就找到了，我要了个房间。我的财物只有身上的这身衣服、一点零钱、一本护照以及银行信用证。我感到一身轻，自由极了，高兴得哈哈大笑起来。

轮船在十一点钟起航。为保险起见，我一直待在房间里，到了那个时间才走出旅馆，上码头目送它离开。然后，我去了罗摩克里希纳教会，想拜访那个在象岛跟我交谈过的长老。我不知道他的名字，费口舌解释了几句，说要见的那位长老刚从亚历山大城来到此处。和长老会面时，我说自己决定在印度留下来了，问他应该看些什么。我们长谈一番，末了，他说自己当晚要去贝拿勒斯，问我愿不愿跟他同行。我高兴得差点没跳起来。我们乘坐的是三等车厢，里面人满为患，乘客们又是吃又是喝又是说话，空气闷热。我一夜没合眼，次日早晨十分疲倦，而长老却容光焕发、精神抖擞。我问他是怎么保持精力的。他回答说：‘靠的是参究无极，于无限中修心养性。’我吃不透他的话，但眼睛却看得清他精力充沛、神清气爽，就像是在一张舒适的床上睡了一夜好觉一般。

贝拿勒斯总算到了。一个和我年纪相仿的年轻人来迎接我的同伴。长老吩咐他给我找个地方住。这个年轻人叫马亨德拉，是位大学教师，和气、善良、聪慧。我们俩一见如故，彼此产生了好感。傍晚时分，他带我乘船游览恒河，叫我大开眼界。全城的人都拥到了河岸边，场面极其壮观，让人心生神圣的敬畏感。而第二天，他带我去看的景象更叫人叹为观止。天没亮他就到旅馆找我，又带我去了恒河边，让我目睹了令人无法相信的场景——成千上万的人来到河边洗净化浴和祷告。我看见一个瘦高个男子，蓬发虬髯，光着身子，只有一条兜带遮住下体，伸出两只长胳臂，仰着脸，面对冉冉升起的太阳高声祈祷。那场面给我留下的印象简直无法形容。我在贝拿勒斯待了六个月，屡次三番于拂晓时分到恒河边去看那稀有的景象。每次去，都叫我感叹不已。那些人的宗教信仰是全心全意、毫无保留、不掺杂任何疑虑的，那种信仰渗透到他们的每一个细胞里。

“所有的人对我都很好。他们发现我不是来猎虎的，也不是来做生意的，而是来学习的，便不遗余力地帮助我。他们听说我想学习兴都斯坦语，感到由衷的高兴，又是为我找老师，又是帮我借书。对于我提出的问题，他们有问必答。你对印度教了解吗？”

“只知道一点皮毛。”我回答。

“我还以为你会对这门宗教感兴趣呢。印度教认为宇宙无始无终，永远在变化之中，先是到极盛，再从极盛到没落，没落至消亡，然后再复生，循环往复，以至无穷。还有什么样的信仰比这种信仰更为精彩呢？”

“印度教徒认为这种周而复始的轮回，其目的是什么？”

“他们大概认为这就是‘无限’的本质。可以看到，他们的这种生死观认为人生只是一个阶段，应该根据每个人前生前世的作为或惩罚或奖励。”

“这种信仰主张的是生命轮回论。”

“人类社会有三分之二的人都信这个。”

“信的人多并不一定就是真理。”

“不错，但至少值得认真思考。基督教曾经吸收了不少新柏拉图主义[173]的思想，也完全可以将这种学说纳入其中嘛。其实，基督教在初期阶段就有一个流派相信这种生命轮回论，却被视为异端邪说。若非如此，基督教徒们定会笃信这种观点，就像他们相信耶稣复活一样。”

“我觉得这意味着灵魂从一个躯体转向另一个躯体，而这种转换无休无止，根据前生的功与过区分优与劣。你说是不是？”

“我想是的。”

“可是，我不仅有灵魂，也有躯体呀。谁能说得清我之所以是我，我的躯体碰巧在其中起了多大作用呢？如果没有那只畸形足，拜伦还能成为拜伦吗？如果没有癫痫症，陀思妥耶夫斯基还能成为陀思妥耶夫斯基吗？”

“印度人是不会说‘碰巧’的。他们会说是你前生的所作所为，才使你的灵魂投进一个残缺的身体。”拉里说着，用手指轻轻敲着桌子，目光飘向远方。后来，他嘴角浮出一丝笑意，眼里显出若有所思的神情，继续说道：“你可曾想到过，这种轮回论阐述了恶有恶报的道理，却也说明了恶在世间是必然的存在？如果我们受的恶报是我们前生造孽的结果，我们就会乖乖地忍受，并在今世努力行善，使来生少受些苦。自己接受恶报倒还容易，只要挺起胸膛去承受就行了，但最叫人受不了的是目睹他人遭受痛苦，而那种痛苦并非罪有应得。如果你能想得通，就会认为，那是前世造孽的必然报应，你可以同情他们，尽你的力量去减轻他们的痛苦，而且理当如此，但你却没有理由怨天尤人。”

“可是，为什么上帝不在一开始就创造一个没有痛苦和不幸的世界，一个不需要功与过决定人生的世界呢？”

“印度教徒不说什么开始不开始。他们认为人的灵魂与宇宙共存，和日月同生，其本质由前世决定。”

“那么，这种生命轮回学说对信徒的生活有实际影响吗？这才是检验真理的标准。”

我想是有的。我可以告诉你，我认识一个人，这种学说就对他的人生产生了实际影响。话说我到印度的头两三年，一般都住在当地的旅馆里，但有时候也有人会请我去他家住住，其中一两次去土邦主家做客，住的是豪宅。通过贝拿勒斯一个朋友的关系，我被邀请到北方的一个小邦去做客。那个邦的首府让人心情愉悦，是‘一座玫红色的城市，历史悠久’。我被引荐给了该邦的财政部长。他在欧洲求过学，是牛津大学的高才生。与之交谈，你会觉得他是个不乏智慧的进步开明人士，一个颇负盛名的精明强干的部长，一个聪颖、机敏的政治家。他身穿西装，外表整洁，长得一表人才，跟大多数中年印度人一样有点发福，嘴上留一撮胡子，修剪得又短又整齐。他经常请我去他家做客。他家有一个大花园，我们就坐在参天大树的树荫下海阔天空地聊天。他有一个妻子和两个成年的孩子。你会觉得他是个平平常常、普普通通的英国化了的印度人。谁知一年后，也就是他五十岁的时候，他竟然要辞去肥差，将家产交给妻子和孩子，去做一个托钵僧云游四方，这叫我不由得吃了一惊。而最叫人感到意外的是，他的朋友们以及那个土邦主都顺其自然，认为很正常，没有什么可大惊小怪的。

有一天，我跟他说：‘你思想开化，见过世面，又读书破万卷——科学、哲学、文学书无不浏览，难道你真心实意相信灵魂转世一说吗？’

他听后表情大变，换上了一副先知的面孔。

“‘我亲爱的朋友，’他说道，‘假如我不相信，那么，生命对我而言就没有意义了。’”

“你自己相信吗，拉里？”我插话问。

“这个问题很难回答。我认为，西方人不可能像东方人那样从心底里相信。这种信仰已经注入了他们的血液中。对你我而言，它只不过是仁者见仁智者见智的观点。我既相信也不相信。”

他停顿了一下，用手托住下巴，眼睛望着桌面。片刻之后，他把身子又靠了回去。

“我曾经有过一次离奇古怪的经历，我想讲给你听听。当时我在静修处修行，一天晚上在自己的小屋里，正在按印度朋友教给我的方法练习冥想。我点了一支蜡烛，把注意力集中在烛光上。过了一段时间，我在烛光里很清晰地看见了许多人，一个挨一个地排成了一条长龙。为首的是一个年事已高的妇女，戴一顶花边帽，两鬓灰白的头发垂下来盖在耳朵上。她上穿黑色紧身衣，下穿黑绸荷叶边裙（我想就是上世纪七十年代流行的那种款式），面对着我，姿态娴雅、超脱，两臂沿身体下垂，手掌心向着我。她脸上布满了皱纹，表情亲切、和蔼、温柔。紧随其后的是一个瘦高个犹太人，由于侧着身子，只能看见他的侧身像——大鹰钩鼻、厚嘴唇，穿一件黄色宽松长袍，浓密的黑发上扣一顶黄色瓜皮帽。他看上去像个勤奋好学的学者，神情严肃，同时充满了激情。他身后站着个年轻人，面朝着我，眉眼看得很清晰，就好像中间没有隔任何人似的。他面色红润，乐呵呵的，一看就知道是个十六世纪的英国人。他傲然站立，两腿微微分开，一副骄横跋扈的神情。他穿一身红衣，很气派，像朝服一般，脚蹬宽头丝绒鞋，头戴丝绒扁帽。跟在这三人身后的是一条长龙，望也望不到头，就跟电影院外买票排的长队一样，但朦胧模糊，看不清面目，只觉得那些缥缈的身影在移动，像夏风吹拂下起伏的麦浪。过了一会儿，也不知是过了一分钟、五分钟还是十分钟，那些人慢慢消失在了漆黑的夜色里，我眼前只剩下那不摇不晃的烛光。”

拉里说到此处，微微一笑。

“当然喽，这也许是我睡糊涂了，或者做了一场梦。也可能是我盯着那微弱的烛光看，结果进入了催眠状态。而那三个人物，我看得清清楚楚，就像我现在看你一样清楚的三个人物，他们只不过是保留在我潜意识里的一些图像而已。或许可以说，他们是我的前生相。前不久，我也许是新英格兰的一位老太太，而在这以前是勒旺岛的一个犹太人；再往前追溯至塞巴斯蒂安·卡伯特[174]从布里斯托尔启航不久的那段时间，我曾是威尔士亨利亲王宫廷里的一个侍从。”

“你那个玫红色城市的朋友最后怎么样啦？”

两年后我去了南方的一个叫马都拉的地方。一天晚上，在马都拉的寺院里，有人碰了碰我的胳膊，回头一看，见是一个大胡子，长长的一头黑发，光着身子，只在腰间围了一条束带，拿一根手杖和圣徒化缘用的钵子。直到他开口说话，我才认出他就是我的那位朋友。这一惊可是不小，我一时都不知说什么好了。他问我这两年做些什么，我告诉了他。他又问我去何处，我说去特拉凡哥尔。他建议我去见见希瑞·格涅沙，说道：‘他会解答你的问题的。’我让他讲讲那人的情况，他却只是笑笑，说一切见面自知。此时，初见他时的那种惊讶心情已经消失，我问他在马都拉干什么。他说自己正在朝圣途中，准备到印度的各个圣地去参拜。我问他的食宿怎么解决。他说如有人家收留，他就睡在凉台上，否则就睡在树下或寺院里。至于食物，有人施舍就吃，无人施舍便饿肚子。我打量了一下他，说他变瘦了。他大笑，说瘦下来反倒好。随后，他向我告别——听这个腰间只围一块布的人用英语说‘再见，老弟’，真是滑稽。后来，他就进了寺院的内室，那儿是不准我进的。

我在马都拉待了一段时间。马都拉的寺院恐怕是全印度唯一的一个允许白人四处随意走动的寺院，只是院里最为神圣的地方还是不准进的。一到晚上，这儿便人头攒动，男女老少都有。男人们赤裸上身，腰间围一块布，额头上厚厚涂一层牛粪烧剩的白灰（往往有人在胸口上和胳膊上也涂这种白灰）。只见他们拜拜这个神龛又拜拜那个，有时匍匐在地上，脸朝下，行五体投地礼。他们祈祷，诵读连祷经文；他们相互呼叫、寒暄、争吵或激烈地辩论。有人骂出的脏话简直是亵渎神明，而奇怪的是，神明似乎就在跟前，却不闻不问。

“穿过长长的过厅，过厅的房顶由一根根雕刻着图案的石柱支撑，而每根柱子跟前都坐着一个托钵僧，面前放一只化缘的钵，或者一小块席子——时不时会有施主将铜币丢在席子上。托钵僧有的穿衣服，有的几乎赤身裸体；有的目光茫然地望着从跟前走过的人；有的在默默地或出声地诵经；有的在冥想，对川流不息的人群视而不见。我举目望去，要寻找我的那位朋友，却不见其踪影，想来他又踏上了实现自身目标的旅途。”

“什么目标？”

“即免受轮回之苦。根据吠陀经义，真我（他们称为阿特曼，咱们称为灵魂）不同于肉体和感觉，不同于思想和智慧，是‘无限’的一个组成部分；鉴于‘无限’是无边无际的，没有‘部分’之说，所以‘真我’实为‘无限’之本身。它并非创造之物，而是与天地共生之物。一旦摆脱七重蒙蔽，它便会回归它的原始之地——‘无限’。它就像海里蒸发起来的一滴水，在一场雨后坠进水潭，然后流入溪涧，进入江河，通过险峻的峡谷和广袤的平原，迂回曲折，击石穿林，最后抵达它的发源地——无垠的大海。”

“可是，那个可怜的小水滴一旦融入大海，岂不就丧失了个性。”

拉里抿嘴一笑。

“你要尝糖的味道，你并不是要变成糖。何谓‘个性’，还不就是自我主义的一种表现吗？灵魂只有彻底摆脱个性，才能和‘无限’融为一体。”

“你大谈‘无限’，好像很熟悉一样，拉里。这是一个冠冕堂皇的词。你觉得它究竟指的是什么呢？”

“它是一种存在，不能具体地说它是什么或者不是什么。它是无法表达的。印度人称它为大梵天。哪儿都没有它的身影，却无处不在。世间万物都隐含着它的因素，都依赖它而存在。它非人非物，非因非果，超出了‘持久’和‘变化’之范围，超出了‘整体’和‘部分’之范围，也超出了‘有限’和‘无限’的范围。它是永恒的，因为它的完善与时间无关。它就是真理和自由。”

“我的老天！”我在心里叫了一声，但对拉里说出来的话却是：“可是，一种纯理性化的观念又怎么能抚慰受苦受难的众生呢？人们希望有一个人性化的上帝，受苦受难时可以向他寻求安慰和鼓励。”

“也许在遥远的未来，人类会大彻大悟，发现只能在自身灵魂里寻找安慰和鼓励。我个人认为，所谓的崇拜人性化的上帝只是古代朝拜凶残暴虐神祇那种旧信仰的残留。我认为上帝只在我的心中，而不在别的地方。如果是这样，我应当崇拜谁呢？崇拜我自己？人的精神发展是分不同层次的，因此在印度人的想象中，‘无限’就有了几种表现形式——大梵天、毗湿奴、湿婆（另外还有上百种称呼）。‘无限’寓于世界的创造者和统治者‘自在天’之中，也寓于农民在太阳烤焦的土地里放一朵鲜花所供奉的卑微小神之中。印度的那些名目繁多的神只是形式，目的是让人们意识到：‘真我’乃‘我’与上天之合体。”

我望着拉里，思绪万千。

“真不知是什么在吸引着你，使你沉迷于这样的信仰。”我说道。

“这我是可以给你讲一讲的。我一直觉得宗教的创始人有点可悲，他们设置了救赎的条件——那就是你得相信他们。就好像他们缺乏自信心，非得要你的信仰给他们撑面子似的。这会叫人想起古代的那些异教神——那些神必须要信徒烧纸钱供奉，否则便会形容憔悴。不二吠檀多[175]不需要你做任何事情，只要求你怀着炽热的感情去探知‘存在’。它断言，你一定能感受到上帝的存在，就像你能感受到欢乐或痛苦一样。如今，有许多印度人（据我所知人数达成百上千）自认为已经做到了这一点。通过认知了解‘存在’——我认为这种观点很精彩，值得称赞。在后期，印度的圣徒们认识到了人类的弱点，承认通过大爱和勤奋的工作也能得到拯救。但是，他们从不否认，最高级（也是最艰难）的途径仍是认知——认知是人类最宝贵的能力，也是人类理性的形式。”

首先我得声明，本人此处无意把笔墨花费在阐述所谓“吠檀多”[176]的哲学思想体系上。对吠檀多我知之甚少，无力为之。即便我能为之，此处也不是我为此挥洒笔墨的地方。我和拉里的谈话是一次长谈，他讲的内容极为丰富，但由于本书的框架为小说，不便一一陈述。我所关心的是拉里本人，马上就会向读者交代他将会采取的一些行动，而他的行动与他的思想以及那些特殊的遭遇有着千丝万缕的联系，所以我觉得应该略加叙述，否则读者会以为他的所言所行缺乏道理。如若不是出于这种考虑，我是不会涉及错综复杂的印度宗教的。他的声音犹如天籁，随便说句话，便可打动人心；他的脸部表情经常随着他的思想在变化，从严肃认真变为轻松欢快，从沉思变为戏谑，就像小提琴在演奏协奏曲的几个曲调时拉出一串动听的音符，钢琴也随之奏鸣。我只恨自己才疏学浅，无法用语言加以展现。尽管说的都是严肃的事情，他却语气自然，似拉家常，也许带几分矜持，但完全不是克制，仿佛在谈天气和收成一样。如果他给读者的印象是迂腐的说教，那都是由于我笔拙所致。他既谦虚又诚恳，这一点显而易见。

此时，饭馆里只剩下零零星星几个客人。那些喝醉了酒闹事的人早已离去，那几个做皮肉生意的可怜虫回她们藏污纳垢的住所去了。时不时会有一个倦容满面的人走进来喝杯咖啡、吃块三明治，或者走进来一个好像还没有完全睡醒的人，喝上一杯咖啡醒神。他们都是些脑力工作者。第一类人是下了夜班回家睡觉去的，第二类则是被闹钟叫醒，不情愿地去上白班的。拉里似乎对时间以及周围的情况全然不加留意。我这一辈子遇到过许多离奇古怪的事情，非止一次和死神擦肩而过，非止一次邂逅爱情，并心里有所感应。我曾经骑着一匹小马穿越中亚，所走的就是马可·波罗当年去神秘的中国走过的那条路；曾经在彼得堡一间整洁的会客室里一面喝俄国茶，一面听一个上穿黑衣下穿条纹裤的矮子细声细气地讲述他刺杀一个大公的经历；曾经坐在英国议会大厦一间客厅里倾听着海顿[177]的恬静、柔和的钢琴三重奏，而窗外却是一片炸弹爆炸的声音。但我觉得以前的那点事情都不如眼前的情况离奇——在一家装饰花哨的餐馆里，我坐在一把红棉绒椅子上听拉里一个小时又一个小时地高谈阔论，大谈上帝和永恒，谈“无限”以及无休无止的生命轮回。





八


拉里沉默了下来，有几分钟没有说话。我不愿意催促他，便耐心地等待着。过了一会儿，他冲我莞尔一笑，就好像突然才意识到我在跟前似的。

“我赶到特拉凡哥尔，发现没必要打听希瑞·格涅沙的下落。说起他，路人皆知。起初，他进入深山，在一个山洞里隐居，一住就是好多年。后来，有人劝说他移居平原，一位施主舍出一块地，给他盖了座土坯房。那儿离首府特里凡得琅路途遥遥，我花了一整天的时间，先是乘火车，后又坐牛车，终于到了他的静修处。在院子的入口处，我碰见一个年轻人，问他能不能拜谒静修者。此行，我带来了一篮子水果作为见面礼。几分钟后，那个年轻人走回来，把我领到了一个狭长的大厅里，四下里开着一扇扇的窗户。在大厅的一角，只见希瑞·格涅沙端坐于一个蒙着虎皮的台子上，正在冥想。‘正在恭候你的到来呢。’他启口说道。我先是感到诧异，继而心想一定是马都拉的那个朋友说起我来着，于是便向他提到了那位朋友的名字，谁知他摇头表示不认识。我把水果呈上，他吩咐那个年轻人收走。大厅里只剩下我们俩，他一句话也不说，默默地望着我。不知道这种沉默的局面持续了有多长时间，大概有半个小时吧。以前我对你说过他的情况，但是却没有提到他的气质——他浑身散发出的气息是宁静、善良、平和以及无私。我一路赶来，觉得又热又累，而后来逐渐静下来，感到出奇地放松。没等他再说任何话，我就意识到他正是我寻找的人。”

“他会说英语吗？”我插话问道。

不会。不过，你知道，我学语言是相当快的。那时我已经掌握了一些泰米尔语，在南方能听得懂别人的话，别人也知道我说的是什么。在沉默了许久之后，他终于开了口。

‘你来这儿有何贵干？’他问道。

我向他讲述了自己来印度的经历，讲述了我在印度三年来的遭遇。我说自己四处打听智者和圣贤，然后逐一拜访，结果发现无人能够解答我心中的疑问。讲到此处，他打断了我的话说道：‘这些我都知道，不必再讲。你来这儿有何贵干？’

‘是想请你做我的导师。’我回答。

‘只有婆罗门才能为人导师。’他说。

他一直在盯着我看，神情古怪、专注，后来他的身体突然变得硬挺挺的，眼睛似乎转为内视，看得出他已进入印度人所说的入定状态。进入这种状态，一个人会物我两忘，成为‘认知’和‘无限’。我席地盘膝而坐，面向着他，心里怦怦直跳。过了不知有多长时间，他轻轻发出一声叹息，我情知他已恢复了常态。他望了我一眼，目光柔和，里面包含着慈悲和爱。

‘那就住下来吧。’他说道，‘他们会告诉你歇宿的地方。’

“分给我的下榻处就是希瑞·格涅沙最初来到平原上时所住过的那间土坯房。他现在住的厅堂（他不分日夜都待在此处）是后来门徒越来越多，慕名赶来参拜的人络绎不绝的时候，特意为他建造的。为了不至于引人注目，我改穿了舒适的印度服装，把皮肤晒得黝黑，不注意看，你会把我当成本地人呢。我读了许多经卷，静下心来冥想。希瑞·格涅沙有谈兴的时候，我便聆听他的教诲。他不太爱说话，但回答你的提问，他会乐此不疲。听他的教诲，你会茅塞顿开。他的话语如音乐般悦耳。他年轻时严于律己，过着清苦的生活，但对弟子却不刻意要求，只是劝导他们要摆脱私心、情欲、声色的奴役，教导他们应该静修、克制、谦虚、超脱，一心一意、孜孜以求地追求自由，最终得到解脱。人们纷纷从三四英里开外的一个临近小镇赶来参拜（那个镇上有座名寺，逢年过节都会有大量徒众进寺烧香磕头）；也有人从特里凡得琅以及天涯海角赶来见他，向他倾诉自己的苦难，寻求良方妙策，聆听他的教诲。那些人来时忧虑重重，走时心情舒展，内心一片祥和。他的教诲言简意赅。他告诉我们，说人之伟大超出人之想象，修得智慧之身，便可获得解脱。他说要脱离苦海并不一定要出家，只需去掉一个‘我’字；做事不怀私欲，便会获得纯洁之心，舍弃小我，成就大我，就能畅行天下。不过，令人感触最深的还不是他的教诲，而是他的为人，是他的慈祥、气度和圣洁。和他相遇，真是上天的赐福。同他在一起，我感到十分幸福。我觉得自己如愿以偿，实现了人生目标。日月如梭，光阴似箭，一个星期接着一个星期，一个月接着一个月倏忽而逝。我打算住到他圆寂（他说他不准备久留于这个臭皮囊之中），或者说住到一朝大彻大悟，意即冲破愚昧的藩篱，深信不疑地感到自己已与‘无限’融为一体。”

“以后会怎么样呢？”

“以后嘛，如果他们所言不虚，一切就不复存在。灵魂在尘世的旅途结束，一朝逝去，永不复返。”

“希瑞·格涅沙圆寂了吗？”

“据我所知，尚未圆寂。”

他说完，意识到我的问话别有深意，于是淡然一笑。犹豫片刻之后，他又接着说了下去，不过语气有所不同，让我一开始以为他一定是不愿回答我很可能会问到的第二个问题，也就是问他是否已大彻大悟。

我并没有一直住在静修处。我有幸结识了一个当地的森林管理员，此人住在山脚下一座村庄的外边。他是希瑞·格涅沙的崇拜者，一旦从工作中抽出空来，就跑来和我们在一起住上两三天。他是个大好人，我们俩常促膝长谈。他喜欢找我练习英语。在相识了一段时间之后，他告诉我森林管理所在山上有间小屋子，什么时候我想一个人上山去住住，他就把钥匙交给我。后来，我每隔一段时间就到那儿去一趟。路上要跋涉两天——先坐长途汽车到森林管理员的村子，下边的路便需要步行了。不过，到了那里，就别有洞天——环境优雅、景色壮观。我把所能携带的东西装在一只背袋里自己背着，雇了个脚夫替我担食物。在那儿我一住就是多日，直至将食物吃完。那是一个木头小屋，后边带一间厨房，屋里有一张架子床，上面可放铺盖，还有一张桌子和两把椅子，再没有别的家具了。山上很凉爽，有时夜间生一堆篝火倒是挺惬意的。后来得知方圆二十英里渺无人烟，不由心惊胆战。夜间常听到虎啸或者野象群穿过丛林时发出的吼叫。我经常进森林里远足，最喜欢的是找个地方坐下，眺望远远近近的群山，眺望湖泊——黄昏时分，野生动物们纷纷聚在湖边饮水，其中有野鹿、野猪和野牛，也有大象和豹子。

“来静修处满两年时，我又一次到森林小屋里去，原因说出来恐怕会惹你发笑——我想在那儿过生日。我提前一天抵达那儿，次日天未亮就醒来了，心想还不如到我刚才提及的那个观景点看日出去。那地方我闭着眼睛也摸得到。到了观景点，我坐在一棵树下等日出。此时仍是黑夜，但天上的星光已趋于暗淡，白日即将降临。我满怀期待，心里有一种特殊的感觉。曙光神不知鬼不觉地悄悄摸来，慢慢地刺破了黑暗，就像一道神秘的身形蹑足穿过林子。我的心一阵狂跳，就好像有危险在接近似的。太阳升了起来！”

拉里打住话头，嘴角浮出一丝苦笑。

只恨我的表达力不强，不善于用语言描述景色，找不到合适的字眼向你形容破晓时展现在我眼前的那幅壮丽的景观。青山满目，丛林青翠，晨雾仍缭绕于树梢间，远处山脚下铺展着深不见底的湖泊。阳光从山巅间的空隙射进来，把灿银一般的光芒洒向湖面。好一幅美丽的景观，真叫我陶然若醉。一种从未有过的喜悦，一种超然物外的欢乐，荡漾在我的心间。我有一种异样的感觉，感到一阵战栗从脚后跟传到了头顶；我觉得就好像自己的灵魂突然升华，脱离了躯体，感受到从未有过的心旷神怡。一种醍醐灌顶的感觉油然而生——模糊不清的概念得到了澄清，令人困惑的疑难问题得到了解答。我高兴到了极致，乃至于心口发痛，于是便努力想摆脱这种状况，生怕这样下去会死去。然而，这种欢乐又是如此诱人，我宁肯死去也不愿将其放弃。那种感觉，我怎么能说得清呢？任何语言都无法表达我那种欣喜若狂的感受。末了恢复常态后，我已经精疲力竭，浑身发抖。最后，我懵懵然进入了梦乡。

“我醒来时，已是中午。返回小屋的途中，心里轻松愉快，脚下有腾云驾雾之感。我给自己弄了些吃的（天呀，我真是饿坏了），然后点上了烟斗。”

说到这里，拉里把手中的烟斗也点着了。

“我真不敢相信，别人经年累月清心寡欲地苦苦修行，尚未大彻大悟，而我，伊利诺伊州马文镇的拉里·达雷尔，竟然做到了。”

“你不觉得那只是一种催眠状态，是由你当时的心情，再加上孤独感、拂晓时分的神秘气氛以及灿银一般的湖水而造成的吗？”

“我深切地感受到那一切都是真实的。不管怎样，千百年来，全世界的神秘主义者都有类似的体验。印度的婆罗门、波斯的苏非派、西班牙的天主教徒以及新英格兰的新教徒，只要描述那种难以形容的境界，所用词语都差不多。这种境界的存在是无可否认的，难就难在不好解释其原因。至于我当时是和‘无限’融为了一体，还是普通的精神向往（这种向往人人皆有）在潜意识上的一种表现，这我就说不清了。”

拉里停了一下，嘲弄地看了我一眼。

“我问你，你能用拇指碰到你的小指头吗？”他问道。

“当然能。”我笑着回答，并且当场做给他看。

“你可知道这只有人类和灵长目动物能够做到？由于拇指能接触到另外的几个手指，所以手才能成为称心如意的工具。也许，这种灵巧的拇指，当它还在雏形时，只为人类个别的祖先以及大猩猩所拥有，后来经过世世代代的进化才成了人类共同的特征。至于和‘无限’的融合，是许多人都有过的体验，这也许预示着人类意识中的第六感觉进化的方向，后者也许在极其遥远的未来会成为人类共同的特征，使得人类能够直接感受到‘无限’，就像咱们现在感受周围的事物一样容易。至少存在着这种可能性吧？”

“你觉得那会对人类产生什么影响呢？”我问道。

“这就说不清了。当初，人类的祖先能将拇指碰到小指，他们也不知道那一细小的动作后来竟会产生如此重大的影响。至于我自己的那段体验，我只能说，在那如痴如醉的时刻，我的心里一片宁静、欢乐和怡然，看到世界上那极为美丽的景观，不禁眼花缭乱。当时的情景至今仍历历在目。”

“话又说回来，拉里，你们那样看待‘无限’，势必会导致你们认为这个世界及其美景只不过是幻觉，是摩耶一手编织出来的。”

“若是以为印度人将这个世界视为幻觉，那就大错特错了。这并非他们的观点。他们只是说，世界之真实与无限”之真实在意思上是不同的。所谓摩耶，仅仅是狂热的思想家们虚构出来的，借此解释‘无穷’怎样创造‘有穷’。‘轮回’是诸多学说中最具智慧的一种，断定这是永远也解决不了的谜团。婆罗门是真我、极乐和智慧，是亘古不变的，与天地共存，无所缺、无所求，有为也无为，是完善至美的。既然如此，为什么还要创造世界呢？这就难以解答了。如果你提出这个问题，他们一般会回答，‘无限’创造世界只是随意而为之，并没有任何目的。可是，当你想到洪水和饥馑，想到地震和飓风，想到折磨人体的一切疾病，你的正义感就会油然而生，为这许多骇人听闻的灾难被随意创造出来而感到愤慨。希瑞·格涅沙有一副大慈大悲的心肠，不相信这样的学说。他认为这个世界是‘无限’的表现形式，充满了‘完美’。他教导我们说，天神造物是一种责任，而这个世界体现了天神慈悲的心性。我问道：既然这个世界体现的是十全十美天神的慈悲心性，为什么却如此可恨——非得设定目标，要众生摆脱它的束缚才能跳出苦海？希瑞·格涅沙回答，尘世间的完满都是暂时的，只有达到‘无穷’的境界，才可获得持久的幸福。不过，时间的无穷并不能改变事物的本质，不能使善更加善，也不能使白颜色更加白；如果说玫瑰花在中午不再娇艳，而它的美在清晨时却是真实的。世间万物没有一样是永恒的，只有蠢人才会要求事物永不消亡，而更蠢的做法则是放着眼前的欢乐不去享受。如果说变化是事物的本性，明智之举则是将其视为哲学的一种命题。谁也不会在同一条河里反复涉水，而这条河的河水依然潺潺流淌，走到另外一条河，那儿的河水同样清凉沁人。

雅利安人初来印度的时候，把人类已知的世界仅仅看作未知世界的一种表象，但他们喜欢这个世界，觉得它风光旖旎、绚丽多彩。只是经过了若干世纪之后，当征伐的劳累和耗人的气候消磨掉他们的活力，使得他们成为异族大举入侵的俎上肉时，他们方才看到了人生的丑恶一面，并且渴望从轮回中解脱出来。不过，咱们西方人，尤其是美国人，为什么要畏首畏尾，害怕什么衰朽、死亡、饥渴、疾病、衰老、悲伤和幻象呢？咱们充满了旺盛的生命力。那时，我坐在自己的小木屋里抽着烟斗，觉得浑身精力充沛，比以往任何时候都精神抖擞，体内有一种力量急切地要爆发出来。要我远离尘世，过一种与世隔绝的生活，显然是不行的。相反，我要置身于尘世之中，欣赏世间的万物——其实并非欣赏事物的表象，而是欣赏其内含的‘无穷’。假如在那我曾经历过的极乐时刻，我果真与‘无限’融为了一体，他们所言不虚，我已脱离了轮回之苦，今世的孽债已经还清，那我就不回到尘世来了。这种念头叫我感到沮丧。其实，我渴望一次次地投生，愿意接受各种各样的生活，不管是体验痛苦还是忧伤。我觉得只有一次接一次地投生，才能实现我的愿望，倾注我的活力，满足我的好奇之心。

第二天早上，我动身下山，于次日来到了静修处。希瑞·格涅沙见我一身西装，不由觉得奇怪。这身衣服是我上山时在森林管理员那个小屋里换上的，因为山上冷，下山时也没有想起要换掉。

‘师傅，我是来告别的，’我说，‘我打算回家乡去了。’

他没吱声，仍和平时一样盘膝坐在虎皮台子上，面前的香炉里燃着一炷香，使得空气里香气氤氲。跟头一天见面时一样，他依然是独自一人在修行。他目不转睛地盯着我看，目光犀利，似乎能看透我的五脏六腑。我知道，他对一切都已心中有数。

‘这样好，’他说，‘你离家太久了。’

“我跪倒在地，接受了他的赐福，再站起来时，早已热泪盈眶。他是一个高尚、圣洁的人，我将永远以认识他为荣。之后，我和静修者们依依惜别——他们中有些已静修多年，有些则是在我之后来的。我把自己的几件衣物和书籍留下，觉得说不定对他们有用，然后背上行囊，身着我来时穿的旧长裤和棕色上衣，头上扣一顶破破烂烂的遮阳帽，步行回到镇上。一星期后，在孟买搭上一条船，在马赛上了岸。”

我们两人沉默了，各自都陷入遐思冥想。尽管我已非常疲倦，但心里仍有谜团，需要问个清楚，于是便开了口。

“拉里老弟，”我说，“你多年来孜孜以求，起初就是为了探清恶的源头。正是这一命题，才催促你不断前行。你刚才讲了半天，却只字未提是否已找到答案，哪怕是不确定的答案也可以。”

“也许这一命题压根就没有答案，或者我不够聪明，没有找到答案。罗摩克里希纳把创造世界看作是天神的一种游戏。他说：‘这就犹如玩游戏，其中有喜也有忧，有美德也有失德，有智慧也有愚昧，有善也有恶。如果将罪恶和痛苦去除掉，游戏便无法再进行下去了。’对这一观点，我持坚决反对的看法。充其量也只能说，‘无限’在这个世界上的表现形式是善与恶并存。没有地壳变化那种叫人无法想象的可怕的灾难，你就不可能欣赏到喜马拉雅山的壮丽景色。中国烧瓷的匠人能够把花瓶烧得像蛋壳一样薄，造型优美，图案漂亮，色彩鲜艳夺目，上的釉精致美观，但就其本质而言，它是易碎的，掉到地上就会成为许多碎片。同样的道理，我们在这个世界上所珍视的一切美好事物都是与丑恶的事物并存的，你说是不是呢？”

“这是一种独到的见解，拉里。但我觉得这样的回答难以叫人满意。”

“我也不满意。”他笑了笑说，“当你断定必须发表看法时，那就尽其力而为之，这就是我的解释。”

“你现在有什么打算？”

“眼前有件事需要了结，之后便回美国去。”

“回去干什么？”

“过日子呗。”

“怎么个过法？”

他回答时语气极其冷静，但眼睛却闪出一丝顽皮的光，因为他知道自己的回答会叫我意想不到。

“不急不躁，宽宏大度，大慈大悲，无私无欲，不近女色。”

“高标准！”我说，“那么，为什么要不近女色呢？你还年轻，女色和吃饭一样是人这个动物最强的本能，你这样抑制它是否明智呢？”

“所幸的是对我来说，接近女色只是寻欢作乐，而不是出于生理需要。根据我个人的经验，印度的那些哲人主张不近女色可以大大增强精神的力量，这话说得再正确不过了。”

“我倒觉得明智之举是在肉体需要和精神需要之间保持一种平衡。”

“印度人觉得这恰恰是西方人所没有做到的。他们认为，西方人发明创造无数，又是建工厂又是造机器，创造了大量财富，总想把幸福建筑在物质上，岂不知幸福与否并非由物质决定，而取决于精神。他们认为西方人选择的道路最终会导致毁灭。”

“你认为要实现自己的精神追求，美国是理想之地吗？”

“为什么不是？你们欧洲人一点不了解美国。你们以为我们积聚了大量的财富便钻进了钱眼里，岂不知我们视金钱如粪土，一有钱就花掉，有时花得好，有时花得糟，但不做守财奴。金钱对我们算不上什么，只是一种成功的象征。我们是天下最地道的理想主义者，也许在某些方面将理想放在错误的目标上罢了。依我之见，一个人最高的理想应该是自我完善。”

“这不失为一种崇高的理想，拉里。”

“是不是值得为实现这一理想而努力呢？”

“可你想过没有，以你一己之力，对焦躁不安、忙忙碌碌、目无法纪、极端个人化的美利坚民族，会产生什么影响呢？这无异于妄想要赤手空拳阻挡住滔滔的密西西比河河水。”

“我可以试试嘛。车轮的发明是靠一己之力完成的，万有引力的发现也靠的是一己之力。所有的努力都会产生一定的影响。哪怕你把一粒石子投入池中，宇宙也会产生一点变化的。如果认为印度的那些圣人过的是无益于众生的日子，那就错了。他们宛若黑暗里的明灯，代表的是一种理想，能滋润众生的心灵。普通人可能永远也无法企及，但他们心怀崇敬之感，从而终身受益。一个人一旦变得纯洁、完美，就会产生广泛的影响，而那些追求真理的人自然而然会受到他的吸引。也许，如果我按照自己的规划去生活，便能对他人产生影响。这种影响也许就跟投石入池一样，激起了一圈涟漪，没什么大不了的，但第一圈涟漪会引起第二圈涟漪，第二圈涟漪又会引起第三圈涟漪。很可能会有一些人从我的生活方式中学到了满足和平静，他们就会将其传授给其他人，于是一传十，十传百。”

“你可知道你在跟什么人作对吗，拉里？要知道，那些庸人曾经用严刑拷打和火刑镇压令他们感到害怕的思想家，虽然那些刑罚早已放弃不用了，现在却发明了一种更为致命的毁灭性武器——泼脏水。”

“我可是个非常坚强的人。”拉里笑了笑说。

“好吧，我只能说你有点进项算你的福气。”

“这笔钱帮了我不小的忙。要是没有它，我就不可能了结我的心愿。不过，我的学徒期现已结束，它对我就只能是负担了，我将弃之不用。”

“这可是极其非理性的打算。你想过闲云野鹤般的生活，就必须在物质上不依赖别人。”

“恰恰相反，在物质上不依赖别人，会让那样的生活变得毫无意义。”

我实在按捺不住，不由露出了不耐烦的神色。

“对于印度的那些浪迹天涯的托钵僧而言，这倒没有什么，他们可以露宿于树下，而善男信女们为了积德，会把他们化缘的钵子装满食物。可是，美国的气候对露宿是很不适宜的，虽然我不敢说自己非常了解美国，但有一点我是知道的——你们的国人有一种共识：不劳动者不得食。可怜的拉里呀，恐怕不等你踏上旅途，就会被人当作流浪汉抓到教养院去的。”

他听了大笑。

“这我知道。入乡随俗嘛，我当然是要劳动的。到了美国，我将想办法在汽车修配厂找个活干。我是个相当棒的机修工，想来不会有什么困难的。”

“这是不是有点大材小用，白白浪费精力呢？”

“我喜欢干体力活。每当书看不下去的时候，我就干干体力活，可以借此振奋精神。记得有一次读斯宾诺莎的传记，了解到他为了糊口曾经为人打磨镜片，而那个传记作家竟视其为可怕的磨难，岂不愚蠢。我敢说，打磨镜片有助于缓解他的智力活动，最起码可以转移他的注意力，使得他暂停劳神的哲学思考。冲洗汽车或者修理汽化器时，我的大脑是放松的；把活干完，我会心情愉快，有一种成就感。当然，我可不是想干一辈子的修理工。离开美国已有多年，我得重新认识它。我将设法找一个卡车司机的工作。开卡车，我能四处跑，把美国跑个遍。”

“也许，你把金钱的一个最重要的用途给忘了——它可以节省时间。生命苦短，百事纷繁，必须只争朝夕。举例来说，你徒步走到哪个地方去，不知会浪费多少时间。在此，坐公共汽车胜似徒步，而搭乘出租车又胜似坐公共汽车。”

拉里嘿嘿一笑。

“此话不假，我却没有想到这一点。不过，我可以拥有自己的出租车，这一问题便迎刃而解了。”

“你这话是什么意思？”

“最终，我将在纽约定居，不为别的，只因为那儿图书馆多。我所需的生活费用不多，在何处过夜全不在乎，每日一餐便可果腹。把要看的地方全都去过之后，我将会攒下一笔钱买辆出租车，当一名出租车司机。”

“真该把你关起来，拉里。你简直就是个疯子。”

“一点不疯，而是很理智，也很实际。有自己的出租车，我开车挣的钱只要够食宿和汽车的折旧费就行了。其余的时间可以用在别处。到哪儿有急事，就开自己的车去。”

“不过，拉里，汽车跟政府公债一样也是财产哟，”我逗趣地说，“有辆汽车，你岂不成资本家了。”

他听了哈哈一笑。

“差矣。我的出租汽车只不过是我的劳动工具而已，相当于托钵僧的打狗棍和化缘钵。”

这一番打趣之后，我们的谈话中止了。我早已留意到来餐馆进餐的顾客越来越多。一个身穿晚礼服的男客在离我们不远的位子坐下，点了一份丰盛的早餐。他看上去很疲倦，却心满意足，猜得到他一夜风流，此刻仍余兴未消。几位老者，由于年纪大睡觉少，所以起得早，一边不慌不忙喝着牛奶咖啡[178]，一边透过厚厚的镜片读着晨报。年轻的食客，有的衣冠楚楚，有的不修边幅，狼吞虎咽吃一个面包，急急忙忙吞几口咖啡，便匆匆赶往商店或办公室上班去了。一个干瘪老太婆拿了一捆报纸进来，走到各个餐桌前兜售，但看上去好像一份也没卖掉。从硕大的玻璃窗望去，发现天已大亮。一两分钟后，所有的电灯都熄灭了，只有这家大餐馆后堂的灯仍开着。我看了看表——已经过七点钟了。

“来点早饭怎么样？”我说。

我们吃了些羊角面包，刚烤出来的，又热又脆，还喝了点牛奶咖啡[179]。我疲倦不堪，无精打采的，样子一定很难看。拉里却精神抖擞，神采奕奕，光滑的脸上一道皱纹也没有，看上去顶多只有二十五岁。一杯咖啡落肚，我才有了几分精神头。

“愿不愿听我进几句忠言，拉里？我可是不经常给人提忠告的。”

“我也是不经常接受别人的忠告的。”他咧嘴一笑，回答道。

“至于处理掉你那一丁点财产，你能不能三思而后行？一旦脱手，就永远回不来了。万一你自己或别人急需要用钱，那时你将追悔莫及，怪自己做了件蠢事。”

他回话时，眼睛里有一丝讥笑的神情，但那讥笑没有丝毫的恶意。

“相比较而言，你可是比我看重金钱。”

“对此我不否认。”我坦率地回答说，“要知道，你口袋里老有钱花，我却不然。有钱就不用求人，而这正是我最为珍视的。你哪里懂得，最叫我感到开心的就是想骂谁，叫他见鬼去，那我就骂谁。”

“我并不想骂任何人，不想让任何人见鬼去。即便我想骂人，也不会因为银行里没有存款就骂不成。这样说吧，金钱对你意味着自由，对我则是束缚。”

“你真是块臭硬臭硬的顽石，拉里。”

“惭愧，惭愧，生性如此。不过，不管怎么样，时间还早着呢，如果要改变主意，还来得及。要说回美国，得等到来年春天。我的画家朋友奥古斯特·科迪特把萨纳里的一座度假屋借给了我，我打算在那边过冬。”

萨纳里是里维埃拉一个名不见经传的海滨度假地，位于邦多勒和土伦之间。画家和作家们对圣特罗佩斯花里胡哨的环境看不上眼，就会跑到这儿来休憩。

“那地方就像一潭死水般缺乏生气，如果你愿去，那你就去吧。”

“我去那儿是有事做的。我收集了许多资料，准备写本书。”

“什么内容？”

“出版后你就知道了。”他笑了笑说。

“写完后，如果你愿意把书稿寄给我，我可以找人为你出版。”

“不用劳驾你了。我有几个美国朋友在巴黎办了一家小型出版社，已经谈妥为我出版此书。”

“以这种途径出版书，别指望销路好，也别指望有谁给你写书评。”

“写不写书评我不在乎，也不指望销路好。印几本够送人就行了——我要寄给印度的朋友以及法国的几个熟人，他们也许会感兴趣的。此书也没有什么大的价值。我写书，只是想给手头的那些材料找个用途，出版书则是觉得应该把心里的想法变为白纸黑字。”

“这两条理由我都理解。”

说话间，我们已吃完了早餐。我喊侍者过来结账。账单送来时，我把它递给了拉里。

“既然你打算把你的钱扔进下水道，那就不妨先替我把饭钱付了吧。”

他大笑一声，把钱付了。由于坐的时间长，我的身子都僵了。走出餐馆时，只觉得腰发酸。秋天早晨的空气洁净、新鲜，令人神清气爽。天空湛蓝，夜间显得邋里邋遢的克利希大街此时有了一些活泼的生气，就像是一个涂脂抹粉的憔悴妇人换上了姑娘家轻快的脚步在走路，看了并不让人感到讨厌。我向一辆驶过的出租车招了招手。

“送你回住处怎么样？”我问拉里。

“不用了。我到塞纳河边走走，然后找个浴场游游泳，再进图书馆里查资料。”

跟他握了握手，然后我目送他迈开长腿悠闲地走过了马路。我可不像他是个铁打的人，于是就坐上出租车，回到了我的旅馆。进了客厅，我发现已经八点多了。

“一个上了年纪的人真不该这个时候才回家。”我冲着钟表玻璃罩里的裸体女子自嘲地说了一声——那女子自从一八一三年起就侧卧在钟表的顶端，姿势在我看来极其不舒服。

那女子眼睛盯着一面镀金铜镜在照镜子，望着镜子中她的那张镀金的铜脸。那种表一个劲地发出嘀嗒、嘀嗒的响声。我放了一浴盆热水开始泡澡，一直泡到水渐渐变温，才出来把身子擦干，然后吞了片安眠药。接下来，我拿起放在床头柜上的那本瓦勒里[180]写的《海滨墓园》，躺到了床上，看看看着便昏然睡着了。





第七章


一


半年后，那是一个四月的早晨，我在费拉角自家房屋顶层的书房里正忙着写东西，仆人进来说隔壁圣让村的村警在楼下要见我。受到外来的干扰，我心里没好气，吃不透他们找我有什么事。我又没做什么亏心事，而且还慷慨解囊，交了慈善基金。作为回报，他们给了我一张卡片，时时放在汽车上，万一因超速行驶或者违规停车被警察抓住，我便可以在出示驾驶执照时，把这张卡片也拿出来，警察就会叮咛我下次小心，对我免于处罚。我心想可能是我的哪个用人遭到了匿名举报（这在法国是很正常的），说她的身份证件有问题。平时，我和当地的警察相处得不错，他们每次登门，都要请他们先喝上一杯才放他们走，所以觉得不会有什么大不了的事情。不过，一次来两个警察，情况就大不相同了。

我和他们握了手，彼此问好。然后，年长的一个从口袋里掏出个本子，用脏兮兮拇指翻着——此人绰号叫“将军”，蓄着威风凛凛的大胡子（这样的胡子我以前从未见过）。

“索菲·麦克唐纳这个名字你听说过吗？”他启口问道。

“我认识的人有叫这个名字的。”我小心地回答。

“我们刚和土伦的警察局通电话，那边的警察总长要你去一趟（Vous prie de vous y rendre[181]），立刻就去。”

“为什么？”我问，“我和麦克唐纳太太并不太熟。”

我立刻想到索菲一定出事了，很可能和鸦片有关系，但弄不懂为什么会把我牵连进来。

“这个不归我管。毫无疑问，你和这个女人是有过交往的。她好像五天没有回家，后来港口从海里捞出一具女尸，警方觉得可能是她，要你去认一下。”

一股寒意传遍了我的全身。不过，这样的结局也是意料之中。她过着今日有酒今日醉的生活，早晚会走投无路，结束自己的生命。

“她穿着衣服，身上带着证件，凭这些是可以辨认出来的呀。”

“她一丝不挂，喉咙被人割断了。”

“我的老天！”我吓得失声叫道。我略加思索，觉得识时务者为俊杰，警方反正是可以强迫我去的，倒不如顺从的好。“好吧，我马上搭乘火车去。”

我看了看火车时刻表，发现可以搭乘五点至六点之间的一趟车到土伦去。“将军”说他将通知土伦的警察总长，让我一到土伦就直接去警察局。那天上午，我没有再写稿子，把一些必需品塞进行李箱，吃过午饭便开车去了火车站。





二


我到了土伦警察局，立即被领进了警察总长的办公室。警察总长是个粗汉，坐在办公桌旁，一张脸黑不溜秋，面色阴沉，看上去像个科西嘉人。也许是出于职业习惯吧，他狠狠地扫了我一眼，目光疑神疑鬼的。可是看见我的纽扣孔里挂着荣誉军团勋章（那是我以防万一临时挂上去的），他便满脸堆起笑容，急忙请我坐下，说了一篓子道歉的话，声称惊动我这样一个有身份的人，实在不得已。我对他也以礼相待，说能为他效犬马之劳，我感到不胜荣幸。接下来，我们言归正传。他又恢复了先前的那种严厉、粗暴的神情，眼睛看着桌子上的材料对我说：

“真是伤风败俗。这个叫麦克唐纳的女人好像名声很坏，是个酒鬼、瘾君子、野鸡。她不但和上岸的水手睡觉，还同城里的地痞流氓上床。以你这样的年龄，以你这样的身份，怎么跟这种人搅和在了一起？”

我本来想告诉他这不关他的事，可是，根据我钻研几百本侦探小说的经验，觉得对待警察还是客气点好。

“我和她并不太熟。初次在芝加哥见她时，她还是个孩子。后来，她嫁了个有头有脸的人。大概在一年前吧，通过她和我共同认识的几位朋友，我才又一次见到了她。”

我一边说话一边纳闷，不知道这位警察总长到底是怎么把我和索菲联系在了一起。此时，只见他把一本书推到了我面前说：

“这是在她的房间找到的。你看看上面的题词，恐怕就不能说你和她不太熟了。”

此书就是我的那本法译版小说，索菲在书店看到过，想请我签名题词。我签了名，并在下面题了词：“亲爱的，让我们看看这玫瑰花……”题词是当时随便想出来的，语气的确有点太亲热了些。

“假如你怀疑我是她的情人，那你就大错特错了。”

“是不是情人不关我的事。”他回答说，眼睛里闪闪发着亮光，“我无意冒犯你，但此处必须补充一句，根据我所了解到的她的喜好，你不是她的意中人。可是，有一点得弄清楚：你绝不会把一个自己不太熟悉的人称为‘亲爱的’。”

“这是龙沙的一首名作中的头一行诗，总长大人[182]。像你这样有文化修养的人对龙沙的诗肯定是很了解的。我当时引用这句诗，是觉得她知道这首诗，会联想到下面的诗行，从而感到愧疚，至少能意识到自己的生活有失检点。”

“当然，龙沙的诗我上学的时候是读过的，可现在乱事如麻，你刚才提到的诗句早已忘掉了。”

接下来，我把那首诗的第一段背诵了出来。我断定他以前对龙沙的名字连听也没听说过，所以不怕他知道后边的诗句并不包含劝人改邪归正的内容。

“她显然是读过一些书的。我们在她的房间里找到了许多本侦探小说和两三本诗集。一本诗集是波德莱尔[183]写的，还有一本是兰波[184]的诗集。另有一本英文诗集，是一个叫艾略特[185]的人写的。他的名气大不大？”

“名气非常大。”

“我没时间读诗。再说，我也看不懂英语。可惜呀，如果他是个好诗人，何不用法语写诗，这样可以让法国有文化的人拜读拜读嘛。”

想到这位警察总长阅读《荒原》的情景，我的心里觉得好笑。突然，他把一张照片推到了我面前。

“对这个人你了解吗？”

我立刻认出是拉里，穿着游泳裤，是最近才拍的一张照片。拍摄的时间大概就是去年夏天——当时他和伊莎贝尔及格雷在迪纳尔避暑。我一急，想说不认识，因为我不愿让拉里也陷于这件麻烦事中，可是细细寻思，觉得既然警方知道了他的身份，我再推说不认识，只会叫人以为里面有不可告人之处。

“他是个美国公民，叫劳伦斯·达雷尔。”

“在那个女人的物品中，这是唯一的一张照片。他们之间是什么关系。”

“他们都是芝加哥附近一个村子里的人，从小就认识。”

“不过，这张照片可是在前不久拍的，我想大概是在法国北部或者西部的一个海滨疗养地拍的吧。要确定位置不会是难事。他是干什么的？”

“是个作家。”我大着胆子说。警察总长的两撇浓眉稍稍抬起来了一点，大概是认为干我们这一行的人，行为都是不大检点的。“不过，他不是靠撰稿为生的。”我又补充了一句，想让拉里的身份显得体面一些。

“他现在何处？”

我又想推说不知道，可还是觉得那样会叫事情更为尴尬。法国的警务也许有各种弊端，但他们有一张网，立刻就能查出一个人来。

“他住在萨纳里。”

警察总长抬头看了看我，显然对我的回答很感兴趣。

“地址呢？”

拉里曾告诉过我，说奥古斯特·科迪特把他的乡间小屋借给了他。我圣诞节回家时，给那个地址写过信，请他来我家做客，住上几天，可不出所料，他谢绝了我的邀请。此时见总长问起，我就把他的地址说了出来。

“我会给萨纳里那边打电话的，让他到这儿来一趟。从他嘴里也许能问出些情况来。”

我心中暗想，警察总长一定把拉里当成了嫌犯，于是觉得心里好笑。我断定，拉里很容易就可以证明自己与此事一点关系都没有。我所关心的是索菲的惨剧，想了解更多的细节，可是总长告诉我的情况并不比我已经了解到的多多少。尸体是两个渔民打捞出来的。至于我们那儿的村警说死者一丝不挂，纯粹是夸大其词。凶手没有剥掉她的内裤和乳罩。如果索菲死时还是我以前见过的那身装束，那么，凶手只是扒掉了她的长裤和运动衫。起初，由于查不出她的身份，警方曾在当地报纸上登了一则告示，描述了她的特征，结果引来了一位女子。此人在一条背街上经营地下出租屋，法语称作妓院，经常有男人带女人或男孩去出租屋鬼混。其实，她是警方的耳目。警方询问了她，问她有什么人到出租屋去，都干了些什么。我上次碰见索菲时，她刚被码头跟前的那家旅馆赶了出来，因为她的行为过于寡廉鲜耻，就连一向宽容的旅馆老板都忍无可忍了。于是，她就到旁边的地下出租屋去，就是刚才提到的那位女子经营的出租屋，想租一套带小客厅的房间。按说，临时把房间租出去，一夜出租两三次，是有利可图的。但索菲按月租，出的价钱更高，于是女房东就答应租给她了。女房东这个时候来警察局，说她的房客几天都没见踪影了。原先她并没有在意，以为索菲到马赛或者维尔弗朗什去了——最近，英国海军的舰队抵达那两处港口，像磁石一样把海岸线一带许多的女人（年轻的以及年老的）都吸引了去。后来，她看了报上登的关于死者的描述，觉得很符合女房客的特征。被领去辨认死尸时，她几乎没有犹豫，立刻便认定死者就是索菲·麦克唐纳。

“既然尸体已经得到了辨认，又何必叫我来呢？”

“贝莱夫人品德高尚，诚实可信，”总长说道，“但她也许出于某种不得而知的原因认错人。不管怎么说吧，我觉得应当找一个和死者关系比较密切的人来证实一下。”

“你认为有可能抓住凶手吗？”

总长耸了耸他那宽厚的肩膀。

“当然，我们正在找线索，曾经到她常去的酒吧询问过几个人。她可能被哪个吃醋的水手杀害，而水手的船已经离开了港口，或者是遇到了一个图财害命的恶棍。她好像身上老带着钱，免不了叫歹徒见财起意。也许有人了解些线索，知道何人是凶手，但她那个圈子里的人，除非利益相关，否则没人会说话的。她跟那些坏蛋鬼混，早晚都会落到这种下场的。”

我一时无语。总长要我次日上午九点钟再来一趟，那时他应当接见过“照片中的这位男子”。然后，由一位警察领我们去认尸。

“死者怎么安葬呢？”

“辨认完尸体，如果你们认定死者是你们的朋友，同时愿意负担丧葬费，就可以得到相关的授权。”

“我敢肯定，我和达雷尔先生都愿意获得授权，越快越好。”

“我完全理解。这是一件叫人伤心的事情。应该让那个可怜的女人尽早入土为安，越快越好。这让我想起我这儿有一张殡葬承办人的名片。此人办事周到，收费合理，会为你们把事情打理好的。我在名片上批几个字，他一定会重视的。”

我敢打包票，他一定会从殡葬费里吃回扣的，但还是对他表示了感谢。他送我出门，一举一动都表现得毕恭毕敬。按照名片上的地址，我即刻前去找殡葬承办人。对方是个爽快人，一副公事公办的样子。我挑了一口棺材，价钱适中，既不是最便宜的，也不是最贵的。他主动提出替我从他熟识的一家花店订购两三只花圈，我接受了他的建议。“这样可以免去先生一些麻烦事，也可以表达我对死者的敬意。”他解释说。我们约定好让柩车于次日两点钟到达太平间。他叫我不必为坟地操心，一切都由他代办，还说“想来死者是新教徒”，如果我同意的话，他将找一位牧师等在公墓那边，于下葬时为死者祈祷。对于他的办事效率，我不得不佩服。不过，鉴于我们素不相识，我又是个外国人，所以他提出我最好预先给他开一张支票，希望我不会介意。他说出的钱数比我预料的要多一点，显然是等着我还价。可是，我二话没说，掏出支票本来，开了一张支票给他。只见他脸上现出了意外的表情，那样子甚至可以说有点失望。

我在一家旅馆要了个房间住下来，次日早晨又去了警察局。等了一小会儿，就有人把我领进了警察总长的办公室。拉里也在那儿，表情凝重、悲伤，坐在我昨天坐过的那把椅子上。总长高兴地跟我打招呼，仿佛我是他失散多年的兄弟似的。

“很好，亲爱的先生[186]，你的朋友极其坦率地回答了我有责任问他的所有问题。他说已经有一年半的时间没见那个可怜的女人了，对此我没有理由不相信。至于他上星期身在何处以及他的照片为什么出现在了那个女人的房间，他解释得清清楚楚，令人十分满意。照片是在迪纳尔拍的，有一天，他和那女人吃午饭时，刚好放在他口袋里，就送给了她。我从萨纳里已经收到了报告，对这个年轻人评价很好。再说，不是我吹牛，我是个很有眼光的人，坚信他不可能干那种伤天害理的事情。那女人是他童年时的朋友，在一个气氛健康的家庭长大，有着种种优越环境，竟会落得如此悲惨的下场，对此我深表同情。不过，这就是人生呀。现在，亲爱的先生们，我的一个下属将陪二位到太平间去，在确定了死者的身份之后，你们的责任就算尽到了。好好去吃一顿。我这儿有一张餐馆的名片，那是土伦最好的餐馆。我在上面批几个字给老板，你们一定会受到最优惠的待遇。辛苦了这么一通，喝上一瓶美酒，对你们会大有好处。”

说话时，他满脸喜色，样子显得很开心。随即，我们跟着一个警察去了太平间。此处的生意很不景气，停尸床上只停放着一具尸体。我们走过去，工作人员揭开了蒙在死者头上的遮布，现出的场景惨不忍睹——死者那染成了银灰色并烫过的卷发已被海水泡直，湿漉漉地贴在脑壳上；面部肿得不像样，看上去似鬼脸一般可怕。尽管如此，一看就知道是索菲无疑。工作人员把遮布又朝下拉了拉，露出了一条刀口——那刀口切穿了喉管，从一个耳朵根切到了另一个耳朵根，让我们俩不忍再看下去。

我们回到了警察局。总长抽不出空接见我们，于是我们就把事情对他的助手说了，助手让我们等了一会儿，便拿来了所需的证件。

我们把证件拿走，给了殡葬承办人。

“好啦，咱们去喝一杯吧。”我说道。

刚才从警察局去太平间，拉里在返回的路上曾说他一眼就认出死者是索菲·麦克唐纳。除此之外，他再也没说过一句话。我领着他向码头走去，到了一家咖啡店——我和索菲曾在这家店里喝咖啡。外边北风呼啸，平时平静的港湾此时白浪翻滚。渔船随着海水在轻轻地摇晃。阳光亮晃晃的。每次刮北风，视野里的一景一物都异常清晰，就像是用聚焦望远镜看到的一样，在刺激着人们的神经，使人们的心灵颤抖。我喝了一杯苏打水白兰地，而拉里碰也没碰我给他要的那杯酒。他一语不发，心情沉痛，木然呆坐着。我没有去打搅他。

过了一会儿，我看了看表说：

“咱们走吧，吃点东西去。两点钟还得到太平间去呢。”

“我饿得肚子咕噜叫，早晨没吃东西。”

从那位警察总长的外表看来，我断定他是个美食专家，于是便将拉里带到了他推荐的那家餐馆。我知道拉里很少吃肉，所以点了煎蛋卷和烤龙虾，又让侍者把酒单拿来，仍按照警察总长的建议挑了一瓶葡萄酒。酒送来时，我给拉里倒了一杯。

“劝你喝下去，”我说道，“杯酒可以解千愁，让你把心里的话说出来。”

他顺从地照我的话做了。

“希瑞·格涅沙常说，沉默也是一种交谈。”他喃喃地说。

“这倒叫我想起了剑桥大学教师们的一次别开生面的社交聚会，有着异曲同工之妙。”

“至于这次的丧葬费，你恐怕得一个人承担了，”他说道，“我现在已囊空如洗。”

“我十分乐意承担。”我答道。把他的话又回味了一下，我接着又说道：“你不会真的那样做了吧？”

他一时没有回答我的话。我注意到他的眼里闪出一丝古怪、戏谑的光。

“你不会仗义疏财，把钱都送人了吧？”

“除了一点钱够我在轮船来之前用，其余的全都送了人。”

“什么轮船？”

“我在萨纳里居住，隔壁有个邻居是一家货轮公司在马赛的代理人，货轮的航线是往返于近东和纽约之间。他们从亚历山大城发电报给他，说一条开往马赛的船有两个水手生病，在亚历山大城上了岸，叫他找两个替工。他是我的好朋友，答应把我弄上船。我要把我的那辆旧的雪铁龙送给他作为纪念。这样，一旦登船，除了身上的一身衣服以及包里的几件日用品，我就一无所有了。”

“钱是你自己的。你是个白种人，已满二十一岁，作为成年人你可以自由支配你的财产。”

“自由这个词用得很恰当。以前我从未感到如此快乐和自在过。到纽约下船，他们会给我一些报酬，够我花一阵子，直至我找到工作。”

“你的书写得怎么样了？”

“哦，已完稿，并印了出来。我开了一张赠书的名单，你在一两天内当会收到。”

“多谢。”

接下来再无话可说，我们俩默默地在友好的气氛中吃完了饭。然后，我要了杯咖啡。拉里点着烟斗，我则燃起一支雪茄。我一边想心事一边望着他。他感觉到我在盯着他瞧，便扫了我一眼，目光里闪出一丝顽皮。

“如果你心里想骂我是个大傻瓜，尽管骂出口好啦，我一点都不会介意的。”

“我心里并没有这种念头。我只是在想，你要是像其他人一样结婚生子，日子过得岂不是比现在美满一些。”

他听后笑了。他的笑容很美，我以前说过足有二十遍了——这种笑容恬适、真诚、迷人，反映出了他那坦率、诚挚、令人舒心的天性。此处有必要再谈及他的笑容，因为这次的笑容除了包含以上成分之外，还有些许凄婉和柔情。

“现在太迟了。我碰到的女子，唯一可婚可娶的只有可怜的索菲。”

我愕然地望了望他。

“发生了那许多事情，你还能这么说吗？”

“她有一颗可亲可爱的灵魂，满怀热情，有追求，慷慨大方。她的理想是高尚的。即便她寻求自我毁灭，最后以悲剧告终，里面也蕴含着高尚的因素。”

我哑口无言，对这种奇怪的论断真不知怎么说才好。

“那你当初为什么不娶她？”我末了问道。

“她那时还是个孩子。当时我常到她祖父家，和她一同在榆树下读诗，说实话，我没想到那个瘦巴巴的丫头正孕育着美丽的精神世界。”

我不由感到奇怪，在结婚这件事上，他竟然只字未提伊莎贝尔。他曾经和伊莎贝尔订过婚，此事不可能已淡然忘却。我只能推想，他也许把他俩的订婚视为两个不明事理的年轻人干下的荒唐事，只能是无果而终。我觉得，若说伊莎贝尔一直在苦苦暗恋着他，这样的想法在他的脑海里恐怕连个影子都没有出现过。

该去料理丧事了。我们到了广场上，那儿停放着拉里那辆破旧不堪的汽车，然后驱车前往太平间。殡葬承办人所言不虚，果真办事效率很高，把所有的事情均已办妥。天上一片亮晃晃的光，狂风大作，把公墓的柏树吹弯了腰，给葬礼增添了几分恐怖的气氛。葬礼结束后，承办人客气地跟我们一一握手。

“但愿两位先生能够满意。一切都进行得非常顺利。”

“的确非常顺利。”我说道。

“请先生记着，如果有什么差遣，我将随时准备效力，路远路近不在话下。”

我对他表示了谢意。走到公墓门口时，拉里问我还有什么事情需要他做。

“没有什么别的事了。”

“我想尽快赶回萨纳里去。”

“把我送到旅馆，好吗？”

汽车启动后，我们谁都没有再说一句话。到旅馆后，我下了车。然后，我们握了握手，他就把车开走了。我在旅馆结了账，拿上行李箱，乘出租车去了火车站。我和拉里一样，也想赶快离开这个地方。





三


几天之后，我启程前往英国。起初我打算直达彼地，但经过了这一通变故之后，特别想见见伊莎贝尔，于是决定在巴黎停留二十四小时。我给她发了封电报，希望能在下午晚一些时候去她家坐坐，并留下来吃晚饭。到了旅馆，我看见她留的一张便条，说她和格雷晚上有饭局，提出欢迎我在下午五点半之前去，因为她去赴宴前需要更换衣服。

天气寒冷，下着大雨，下一阵停一阵。这样的天气，格雷不大可能去莫特芳丹打高尔夫了。这对我不是件好事，因为我想单独见见伊莎贝尔。不过，到了他们家的公寓，伊莎贝尔一见我就说格雷到旅行者俱乐部打桥牌去了。

“我对他说，如果想见你，就不要回家太晚。不过，我们的那个晚宴推迟到了晚上九点钟，九点半赶去就行。所以，咱们有的是时间好好聊一聊，我有许多事情要告诉你呢。”

他们已经把公寓转租出去。艾略特的藏画将在两星期内拍卖。拍卖时他们要到场，所以正准备搬到里茨饭店去住。此事一完，他们就乘船回美国。伊莎贝尔打算把能卖的都卖掉，只留下艾略特在安提比斯家中挂的那些近代画。她虽然并不是十分喜欢这些画，但明智地判断，将来搬到新家，这些画可以起到提高品味的作用。

“遗憾的是，可怜的艾略特舅舅不是很前卫。你知道，毕加索、马蒂斯[187]以及鲁奥[188]的画是很时尚的。艾略特舅舅的画自有其精彩之处，不过怕是过时了些。”

“我要是你，就不操这份心。用不了几年，又会出现一些新的画家。到那时，毕加索和马蒂斯的作品与你的这些印象派画作相比较，也就不见得前卫了。”

格雷和一家生意兴隆的企业在谈判，目前已接近尾声。有伊莎贝尔的钱作为资本，他将会荣任副总裁。这家企业的业务与石油有关，所以他们准备举家迁居达拉斯[189]。

“我们要做的第一件事情就是找一座合适的住房，有漂亮的花园，好让格雷下班回家后有个地方务花弄草，还必须有一个大大的客厅招待客人。”

“真不知你为何不把艾略特的家具也带走。”

“我觉得这套家具很不合适。我想要的是摩登家具，也许带一点墨西哥情调加以点缀。一到纽约我就去打听，看哪一家装饰公司当下最吃香。”

此时，男仆安托万端着个托盘走了过来，上面放着几个酒瓶。伊莎贝尔历来善于察言观色，知道男人十个有九个都觉得自己调鸡尾酒比女人技高一筹（情况的确如此），故而请我调两杯。我把杜松子酒和一种法国酒倒出来一些，掺上少量的苦艾酒。这种苦艾酒可以将干马丁尼从没名堂的酒化为仙露，就连奥林匹斯山上的神仙也肯定愿意舍弃山上自酿的酒，跑来一品为快。我自己倒是一直觉得这种酒的口感更像是可口可乐。我把调好的酒递给伊莎贝尔时，注意到桌上有一本书。

“哈！这是拉里写的书！”我说道。

“是的，今天上午寄来的。我忙得焦头烂额，手头乱事如麻。中午有饭局，下午又去了一趟莫利纽克斯服装店。真不知何时才有闲空看这书呢。”

一个作家成年累月地写一本书，也许呕心沥血才写成，却被人随手放在一旁，等到实在无事可做时才看上两眼，想起来便叫人心寒。拉里的这本书共三百页，印刷质量好，装帧精美。

“你可能也知道拉里一冬天都住在萨纳里。你见过他的面吗？”

“见过。前两天我们俩还去了趟土伦呢。”

“是吗？去土伦干什么？”

“为索菲办丧事。”

“难道她死了不成？”伊莎贝尔惊叫了一声。

“如果她没死，我们又有什么理由为她办丧事呢？”

“这种事可开不得玩笑。”她打住话头，停了一下才又说道，“不过，也没有什么伤心的。她一定是酗酒和吸毒过量导致的死亡。”

“不是的。她是被人割了脖子，赤身裸体抛到了海里。”

我的感觉大概和圣让的那位“将军”警察一样，认为有必要稍加渲染索菲赤身裸体的状况。

“太可怕了！可怜的人儿。她那样放浪形骸，必然会有这种悲惨的结局。”

“土伦的警察总长也是这么说的。”

“他们知道凶手是谁吗？”

“不知道，但是我知道。我认为是你杀了她。”

她一听，惊愕万状地望着我发呆。

“你在胡说什么呀？”她说完，阴阳怪气地扑哧一笑，“随你胡扯去吧。我可是能证实自身清白的，证实我没有去过犯罪现场。”

“去年夏天，我在土伦碰见了她，和她进行了一次长谈。”

“她没有喝醉吧？”

“没有，脑子很清楚。想当初她准备嫁给拉里，可就在举行婚礼的前几天，她却莫名其妙地不见了踪影。她把前因后果都告诉了我。”

我注意到伊莎贝尔脸上的肌肉变得僵硬。接下来，我便将索菲的话一五一十复述了一遍。她侧耳倾听着，神情专注。

“后来，我把她的遭遇想了许久，越想越觉得蹊跷。我来你家吃午饭足有二十次了，从未见你午饭喝过酒。那天你一个人吃午饭，为什么放咖啡杯子的盘里有一瓶齐白露加酒呢？”

“那是艾略特舅舅叫人刚送来的。我想尝几口，看是不是和我在里茨饭店喝的那样合口味。”

“不错，记得你曾交口称赞那酒。我当时有点奇怪，因为你是从不喝那种甜酒的——你非常注意自己的身材，怕喝甜酒会坏了身段。那时候我有个印象，觉得你不怀好意，是在引诱索菲上钩。”

“承蒙夸奖。”

“一般来说，你和人约会是很守时的。你既然约索菲去试衣服——这对她很重要，对你则很有趣，那你为什么不在家等她呢？”

“这是她跟你说的吗？琼的牙齿叫我很担心。牙医忙得不得了，只能按他约的时间去。”

“看牙医，一般都是在看病时就约好下一次去的时间。”

“我知道。可是，他早上打电话给我，说不能按以前约好的时间看病，建议改为下午三点钟，我当然接受了他的建议。”

“难道就不能叫保姆带琼去吗？”

“那可怜的孩子吓得要命，我觉得亲自陪她去，她心里会踏实些。”

“你回来的时候，看见那瓶齐白露加酒有四分之三都被人喝掉了，索菲也不见了，你难道不感到奇怪吗？”

“我以为她等得不耐烦，自己去莫利纽克斯服装店了。我赶到那儿一问，才知道她并没有去，一时觉得莫名其妙。”

“那瓶齐白露加酒怎么解释？”

“哦，我的确看出酒被喝掉许多，还以为是安托万偷喝的呢，差一点责问他。后来觉得他的工资是艾略特舅舅付的，他又是约瑟夫的朋友，所以没有加以追究。他是个很尽职的仆人，即使偶尔偷点嘴，我也犯不着责备他。”

“你可真会撒谎，伊莎贝尔。”

“你不相信吗？”

“根本不相信。”

伊莎贝尔起身，走到了壁炉架跟前。壁炉里炉火熊熊，在这阴冷天叫人感到惬意。她把一个胳膊肘支在壁炉板上，姿态优雅——这是她最为迷人的一种天赋，既仪态万方，又不露任何做作的痕迹。多数有身份的法国女子白日喜欢穿一身黑色的素装，她也一样。这样的装束和她那凝脂一般的肤色相得益彰。这次她穿的衣服款式简单，质料贵重，充分凸显了她那窈窕婀娜的身段。她不停地抽烟，抽了好一会儿。

“无论怎么说，我都应该对你无所隐瞒。那天我有事外出，实属不幸。安托万实在不应当把齐白露加酒和咖啡饮具留在房间里。我出门后，就应该将那些东西撤掉。我回到家，见那瓶酒几成空瓶，当然知道是怎么回事。后来索菲失踪，我猜想她一定故态复萌，纵酒狂欢去了。我之所以只字未提此事，是怕雪上加霜，徒增拉里的烦恼。拉里为此事牵肠挂肚，已经够心烦意乱的了。”

“你敢说那瓶酒不是你故意放在那儿的吗？”

“我敢说。”

“我不相信。”

“不相信就不相信呗。”她一甩手，恶狠狠地把纸烟扔进了炉火里，一双美目怒火燃烧，“那好吧，既然你想了解真相，那我就告诉你吧，然后你就给我滚蛋。是我着意那样做的，而且绝不后悔。我告诉过你，说我会不惜一切代价阻止她嫁给拉里。你和格雷只会袖手旁观，不关心拉里的痛痒。你们只会耸耸肩膀，事后会说他们的婚姻是个弥天大错。你们不关心，可我关心。”

“如果你不加以阻挠，她现在还活着呢。”

“她嫁给拉里，会将拉里抛入痛苦的深渊。拉里想入非非，以为如此可以叫她脱胎换骨、重新做人。男人全都是些傻瓜！我知道她迟早都会再次堕落——这是明摆着的。那次在里茨饭店聚餐，你也看到了她是多么焦躁不安。她喝咖啡时，我留意到你在看她——她的手抖得厉害，一只手不敢拿杯子，只好用两只手捧到嘴边喝。我看到侍者给咱们倒酒时，她的眼睛贪婪地跟着瓶子转，就像一条蛇盯着一只羽毛方满的小鸡拍翅似的。我知道她哪怕出卖灵魂，也会弄一杯喝的。”

伊莎贝尔把脸直对着我，眼里射出两道光来，声色俱厉，加快语速说了下去。

“当艾略特舅舅把那难喝的波兰酒大吹特吹的时候，我心里就有了一计。我觉得那酒味道像马尿，然而我却对其大加赞扬，说我从未喝过这样味道棒到了极点的美酒。我当时就断定，索菲一旦接触到这酒，便难以抵挡住诱惑。于是我就依计行事，又是带她去看时装展览，又是提出要送她一套结婚礼服。约她最后试样的那天，我告诉安托万，说我午饭后要喝齐白露加酒，后又说我约了一位女士来，女士来后让她等一等，喝上一杯咖啡，把酒也留下，她想喝就让她喝。我的确把琼带到了牙医那里，但没有预先约好，医生不能为琼看病。离开诊所，我带琼去电影院看了场纪录片。我打定主意，如果索菲没有碰那波兰酒，我便真心实意和她交朋友。这是真的，我发誓。可是，我回家一看那酒瓶，便知道自己的判断是正确的。她不见了踪影，我敢拿生命打赌，她这一去将永不回头。”

伊莎贝尔说完，已娇喘吁吁。

“我早就猜想到是这么回事。”我说道，“瞧，我刚才所言不虚。你这样做就跟亲手用刀抹她的脖子没什么两样。”

“她是个可恶、邪恶的坏女人，她死了大快人心。”她说着，猛地一屁股坐在了一把椅子上，“给我一杯鸡尾酒，你这浑蛋。”

我走过去，又调制了一杯。

“你是个卑鄙的坏蛋。”她从我手里接过鸡尾酒时说。随后，她挤出了一个笑容，就像是一个做了错事的孩子一样，装出一副天真无邪的样子蒙骗你，想叫你不要生气。“你不会告诉拉里吧？”

“我想都不会往这方面想。”

“你能对天发誓吗？男人说话是靠不住的。”

“我发誓绝不告诉他。即便我想告诉他，也不会有这个机会的，恐怕我今生今世再也见不上他了。”

她一听，立刻坐直了身子。

“这话是什么意思？”

“此时此刻，他已登上了一艘货轮，或者当船员或者当司炉，正在向纽约进发。”

“此话当真？他真是个怪人！几个星期前，他还来了一趟这里，为他那本书上公共图书馆查资料，却没听他说一句要到美国去的话。这样倒好，我们可以在美国相见了。”

“对此我表示怀疑。他的美国跟你们的美国相去甚远，要隔上十万八千里呢。”

接下来，我就把拉里的所作所为以及他的抱负叙述了一番，听得她目瞪口呆，一脸的惊愕，时不时打断我的话，连声说“他疯了，他疯了”。我说完之后，只见她垂头丧气，两行热泪滚滚而下。

“这下子，我真的失去了他。”

她转过身去，脸抵着椅背嘤嘤哭了起来。她毫不掩饰内心的悲伤，一场痛哭让美丽的脸都变了形。我一时束手无策。她究竟怀着怎样缥缈、矛盾的希望（而在我的叙述之后那些希望全都化为了泡影），便不得而知了。我朦胧觉得，她原以为只要能偶尔见见拉里，最起码知道他仍是她生活的一个组成部分，这便可以将他们联系在一起，不管这种联系是多么薄弱，而今拉里斩断了这一联系，使她觉得自己永远失去了他。我感到纳闷，不知她是否觉得自己白费了一番心机，留下的只是满肚子的懊悔。就让她哭吧，哭出来也许心里会好受一些。我拿起拉里的书，将目录浏览了一眼。我离开里维埃拉时，他寄给我的书还没有收到，估计几天内是拿不到手的。书写得完全出乎我的意料，是一本论文集，篇幅和里顿·斯特拉奇[190]的《维多利亚女王时代名人传》相仿，论述了若干名人。书中所选的内容叫我百思不得其解。有一篇是写古罗马独裁者苏拉的——苏拉在独揽大权之后，退位归隐；还有一篇写蒙古征服者阿克巴尔——此人缔造了一个大帝国；一篇写鲁本斯[191]，一篇写歌德，一篇写查斯特菲尔德勋爵[192]。显而易见，每写一篇论文都必须阅读大量的资料，难怪拉里用了那么长的时间才把书写完。我真不明白他为什么舍得花大把的时间写这本书，也不明白他为何要选这些人物作为研究对象。我突然产生了一种想法，觉得拉里可能认为这些人在自己不同的领域取得了辉煌的成就，于是便有了研究的兴趣。他有心弄个水落石出，研究一下他们的成就究竟产生了什么样的影响。

我粗粗浏览了一页，想看看他的文笔如何，发现他用的是学术文章的那种风格，但措辞简洁、语气明快，全然没有刚入门新手的那种咬文嚼字、卖弄辞藻的生涩气。看得出，他非常熟悉那些优秀作家，就跟艾略特·邓普顿熟悉达官贵人一样。我的思绪被伊莎贝尔的一声叹息打断了。只见她苦着脸将杯中由热变温的鸡尾酒一饮而尽。

“我不能再哭了，会把眼睛哭肿的，晚上还有个饭局呢。”她从包里取出一个小镜子，担心地左照右照，“随他去吧。我只想有个冰袋敷在眼上，敷个半小时。”接下来，她在脸上扑了粉，涂了口红。之后，她若有所思地望着我问道：“我做了那种事情，你不会因此对我有不好的看法吧？”

“你在乎我的看法吗？”

“你也许会奇怪，我在乎。我希望你对我有好的看法。”

我笑了笑，说道：

“亲爱的，我是一个极没有道德观念的人。我一旦喜欢上一个人，即便不赞成他干下伤天害理的事情，也还会照样喜欢他。你是个不错的女人，自有你的风采——仪态万方、魅力四射。我不会因为你的行为稍稍看低你的美丽，因为我十分清楚你的美丽完美地综合了高雅的品味以及残酷无情的意志。你只需要一样东西，就可以使你的魅力趋于完善。”

她嫣然一笑，等待着我说下去。

“那就是温柔。”

她唇边的笑意倏然不见了踪影，横扫了我一眼，目光里没有一丝一毫的善意。她定了定神，正要回话，却见格雷摇摇晃晃走了进来。在巴黎住的这三年，他增加了好多磅的体重，脸色比以前更红了，头发秃得厉害，但健康状况良好，情绪高涨。看见我，他简直掩饰不住内心的高兴。他说话时夹带着许多口头禅，明明是用滥了的词语，他却深信不疑自己是第一个使用者。什么“不做亏心事不怕鬼敲门”啦，“屋漏偏逢连阴雨”啦，以及“路遥知马力，日久见人心”什么的。不过，他心地善良，为人无私、正直、可靠，没一点架子，叫你不可能不喜欢他。我对他有一种发自于内心的真情实感。谈到即将回到祖国，他又兴奋又激动。

“万事俱备，只欠东风了。”他说道，“我已整装待发。”

“是否已万事俱备了呢？”

“已是板上钉钉的事了，只剩下在合同上签字了。我未来的合伙人是我大学时的一个舍友，一个挺不错的人，绝对不会叫我吃亏的。不过，一抵达纽约，我还是要即刻飞往得克萨斯落实细节，拿着伊莎贝尔的钱，我可要不见兔子不撒鹰。”

“谁都知道，格雷做生意是有一套的。”伊莎贝尔说。

“我可不是个只知道种田的乡巴佬。”格雷笑了笑说。

接下来，他就滔滔不绝地讲起了他将要涉足的生意，一讲就收不住口了。可是，我对这种事情一窍不通，只听明白了一点——他将时来运转、财源滚滚。他越说兴致越高。过了一会儿，他扭过头对伊莎贝尔说：

“依我看，咱们把今晚那讨厌的饭局推掉算啦，咱们三个到银塔餐厅消消停停地吃饭岂不痛快。你觉得呢？”

“这可不行，亲爱的，不能这样做事。这个饭局是他们专门为你我而设的。”

“你们去吧，反正我也是抽不出身的。”我插嘴说，“一听说你们有饭局，我就打电话约了苏姗娜·鲁维埃，和她一起出去吃饭。”

“苏姗娜·鲁维埃是谁？”伊莎贝尔问。

“哦，是拉里的一个女朋友。”我故意逗她说道。

“我早就怀疑拉里金屋藏娇，瞒着咱们呢。”格雷说完，咯咯咯地笑个不停。

“没影儿的事。”伊莎贝尔打抱不平地说，“拉里的性生活我是很清楚的。他身边压根就没有女人！”

“好的，大家再干一杯，然后各自准备去吃饭。”格雷说。

我们举杯喝了酒，我向他们说了再见。小两口送我进门厅。我穿外套时，见伊莎贝尔挽起了格雷的胳膊，偎在他身上，望着他的眼睛，脸上露出我曾经指责她所缺乏的温柔表情。

“格雷，请你坦率地告诉我，你是不是觉得我是个铁石心肠的人？”

“不是，亲爱的，不沾边的话。怎么，难道有人这么说你吗？”

“没有。”

她把头掉过去，使格雷看不见她的脸，朝我吐了吐舌头。这种样子，要是让艾略特看见，肯定会说她不像个有身份的人。

“那是两码事。”我胡乱支吾了一句，然后出了门，随手把门带上。

当我再次路过巴黎时，马图林一家已经走了，艾略特的公寓房里有了新的住户。我还是蛮想念伊莎贝尔的——她有闭月羞花的容貌，又非常健谈。她善于体察人意，没有什么坏心眼。可惜我再也没有见过她。我不爱写信，也懒得写信，而伊莎贝尔则从不写信。如果不能给你通电话或发电报，那就会彻底跟你失掉联系。那年圣诞节，我倒是收到她一张贺卡，上面有张漂亮的照片，照的是一幢房屋，房屋的门廊是殖民地时期的，周围长着郁郁葱葱的橡树。这恐怕就是农场上的那幢房屋，他们缺钱时曾想卖卖不掉，现在大概准备留下来自家住了。邮戳表明贺卡是从达拉斯寄来的，由此可以断定那桩生意已经成功，他们已在达拉斯定居。

我没去过达拉斯，但可以想象得来那儿跟美国其他的城市别无二致——从住宅区开车去商业中心和乡间俱乐部都很方便；富贵人家住豪宅，有大花园，从客厅窗户可望见风景优美的山丘或峡谷。伊莎贝尔肯定会住这样的小区，住这样的豪宅，从地窖到阁楼都是由纽约最时髦的屋内装饰师按照最时新的式样布置。我只希望她的那些画——雷诺阿的画、马奈的花卉、莫奈的风景以及高更的画，挂在她家墙上，不要显得太过时。餐厅无疑会不大不小，正适合伊莎贝尔隔三岔五请女友们来吃午饭，好酒好菜地招待她们。她在巴黎长了不少见识，一眼就可以看出客厅合不合适，客厅不如意她是不会住的。眼见两个女儿一天天长大，她还指望在客厅为女儿举办交际舞会呢——这可是为人母的一项惬意的职责。现在，琼和普里西拉恐怕已到了谈婚论嫁的年纪。她们姐妹肯定有令人钦羡的教养，上的是最好的学校；伊莎贝尔准会叫她们学习琴棋书画，让门当户对的小伙子们一见倾心。格雷想必脸色更红，心情更愉快，头更秃，体重也大大增加了。若说伊莎贝尔，我坚信不会有什么变化。她会依然光彩照人，美貌不输她的两个千金。马图林一家在社区里一定很有分量。我坚信，他们一定人缘好，颇受欢迎。伊莎贝尔风趣幽默、彬彬有礼、殷勤好客、识分寸知进退，而格雷出类拔萃，是人之佼佼者。

我仍然时不时去看望看望苏姗娜·鲁维埃。后来，她的境遇发生了意想不到的变化，使她离开巴黎，也从我的生活中消失了。那是一天下午，大致在我叙述的那些事件发生两年之后，我在奥德昂大剧院走廊的书摊前浏览书籍，很惬意地消磨了一个小时，后来觉着闲得无事可做，就想起去看望一下苏姗娜。我已有半年时间没有见她了。她开门时，手端调色板，嘴里衔着一支画笔，穿一件罩衫，上面满是油彩。

“啊，是您，亲爱的朋友。请进，请您进来。[193]”

她这样客气使我有点诧异，因为我们之间一般只是以你我相称。我跨进那个既当客厅又做画室的小房间，见画架上放了一幅油画。

“我忙得不可开交，简直都晕头转向了。你请坐吧，我得继续工作了，一会儿都耽搁不得。说来你也不信，我要在迈耶海姆画廊办个人画展，必须准备三十幅画参展。”

“在迈耶海姆画廊？这真了不起。你是怎样做到的？”

迈耶海姆画廊可不是塞纳路上的那些靠不住的小画廊——那些野画廊门面小，一缺钱付不起房租，就会关门大吉。迈耶海姆画廊是一个很体面的画廊，位于塞纳河畔有钱人的地区，享有国际声誉。一个画家一旦被这家画廊看中，就会走上通向成功的康庄大道。

“阿吉里先生带迈耶海姆先生来看过我的画，迈耶海姆先生认为我很有才气。”

“别吹了，老伙计。[194]”我回了一句。我觉得这句话最好翻译为：“鬼才会相信你的话，老伙计。”

她瞥了我一眼，随即扑哧笑出了声。

“我要嫁人了。”

“嫁给迈耶海姆吗？”

“别犯傻！”她放下了画笔和调色板说，“我画画画了一整天，也该休息一下了。咱们不妨来杯波特酒，容我细细道来。”

法国人的生活中也有令人不爽的一面——他们常常在最不恰当的时候逼你喝下一杯酸不拉叽的波特酒。此时，你必须乖乖地从命。苏姗娜取出一瓶酒和两只杯子，把杯子斟满，坐下来如释重负地叹了一口气。

“今天画画，一连站了几个小时，站得我静脉曲张、腿发痛。情况是这样的。阿吉里先生的妻子今年年初去世了。她是个好人，也是个好天主教徒。不过，阿吉里先生娶她并非出于本意，而是出于对生意的考虑。他固然敬重她，但若说她的死令他痛不欲生，那就言过其实了。他儿子的婚姻门当户对，事业也干得风生水起；他女儿的婚事亦安排妥当，要嫁给一位伯爵——那伯爵虽说是比利时人，却是货真价实的贵族，在那慕尔附近有一座非常漂亮的城堡。阿吉里先生认为，他妻子的在天之灵绝不愿因为自己的缘故耽搁了一双儿女的幸福，于是决定不等服满丧期，只要安排停当就举办婚礼。里尔的房子那么大，只剩下了阿吉里先生一个人，孤零零的，显然需要一个女人在身边，照顾他的起居，料理事务——他那么有身份的人，势必有重要的事务需要关照。长话短说，他请求我代替他妻子的位置。他说的话入情入理：‘我第一次结婚是为了消除两家对立公司的竞争，为此我毫不后悔，但第二次婚姻就要合自己的心意，选自己喜欢的人了。’”

“恭喜，恭喜。”我说。

“代价是失去自由。我喜欢无拘无束的生活，但前途却是不得不考虑的。不瞒你说，我马上就要步入不惑之年了。阿吉里先生正在危险的年龄段，万一他突发奇想，去追求一个二十岁的大姑娘，那该如何是好？我还得为我的女儿想一想。她今年十六岁，水灵灵的，越长越像她爸爸。我让她接受了良好的教育固然不错，但残酷的现实摆在你面前不容忽视：她既没有当演员的天赋，也没有她可怜母亲的那种气质去当妓女。那我问你，她有什么盼头呢？末了只好给人家当秘书，或者在邮局里谋个差事。阿吉里先生极其慷慨，同意让她和我们住在一起，并且答应给她一笔丰厚的奁资，使她能嫁个好人家。请相信我，亲爱的朋友，不管别人怎么说，婚姻仍是女人最实在的职业。于是，考虑到女儿的幸福，我毫不犹豫地接受了阿吉里先生的求婚，即使牺牲某种满足也在所不惜——再说，一年一年地过去，这种满足愈来愈不容易获得了。有一点我必须告诉你：一旦结婚，我将绝对恪守妇道（dune vertu farouche[195]）。根据多年的经验，我深信夫妻双方必须绝对忠实，才能使幸福的婚姻固若金汤。”

“这是多么崇高的情操啊，我的美人儿！”我说，“阿吉里先生还会和从前一样每两个星期来一趟巴黎洽谈生意吗？”

“哎呀呀，你把我当成傻瓜了不成，我的小宝贝？阿吉里先生向我求婚，我提的第一个条件就是：‘亲爱的，请听我说，你来巴黎开董事会，我也跟着来。让你一个人来，我是不放心的。’他回答说：‘请放心，我都这把岁数了，不会做出蠢事来的。’我则说：‘阿吉里先生，你正当生命力旺盛的年龄，我比谁都清楚你充满了激情，而且相貌堂堂、气宇轩昂，举手投足都让女人动心。总而言之，我怕你经不起诱惑。’最后，他答应把董事会的位置让给儿子，由儿子代替他来巴黎开会。阿吉里先生假装不快，好像我不通情理似的，其实心里像灌了蜜一样甜。”说到此处，苏姗娜满足地长出了一口气，“对我们可怜的女人来说，假如男人没有这种难以捉摸的虚荣心，日子就如雪上加霜。”

“这样的结局非常好。但这和你在迈耶海姆画廊办个人画展有什么联系呢？”

“我可怜的朋友，今天你可真是有点不开窍了。多少年来我不是告诉你，说阿吉里先生是一个聪明绝顶的人吗？他得考虑自己的社会地位，得考虑里尔的人喜欢评头论足。他是个重要人物，而我作为他法定的妻子，按他的愿望应该在社会上占有一席之地。你也知道外省人的那种德行，他们喜欢管别人的闲事。他们势必会问，苏姗娜·鲁维埃是何许人？他们将得到这样的回答：‘苏姗娜·鲁维埃是一位出类拔萃的画家，最近在迈耶海姆画廊的个人画展取得了巨大成功，真是实至名归。’‘苏姗娜·鲁维埃是殖民步兵团一位军官的遗孀，多年靠卖画为生，含辛茹苦抚养一个早早便丧失父爱的娇女，表现出了一个法国妇女的刚毅性格。令人快慰的是，善于发现人才的迈耶海姆画廊将为她举办个人画展，公众不久便可大饱眼福，欣赏到她细腻的笔触和娴熟的技法。’”

“这是胡扯些什么呀？”我竖着耳朵听后，启口问道。

“亲爱的，这是阿吉里先生设计的广告语，将会在法国的各大报纸登出。他做事滴水不漏。迈耶海姆提的条件非常苛刻，但阿吉里先生却认为是小事一桩，予以全盘接受。画展的开幕式上，将会喝香槟酒表示庆祝，美术部长（此人欠阿吉里先生的人情）将要发表精彩的致辞，将会盛赞我作为女人的情操以及作为艺术家的天赋，最后宣布国家有责任、有义务奖励人才，已经买下我的一幅画由国家收藏。巴黎各界人士都将到场。迈耶海姆将亲自关照那些评论家，确保他们的评论文章不仅要大加赞誉，而且篇幅要长。评论家们是很可怜的，挣的钱实在太少了。给他们一个捞外快的机会，也算是积德行善了。”

“这都是你应该得到的，亲爱的，”我说道，“好人有好报嘛。”

“Et ta soeur[196]，”她答道，这句话很难翻译，“还不止这些呢。阿吉里先生又用我的名字在圣拉斐尔海边买了一幢别墅，这样，我在里尔的社交界便有了自己的位置，一是因为我是个杰出的艺术家，二是由于我还是个有产业的女人。再过两三年他就要退休了，那时，我们将像上流人士（comme des gens bien[197]）那样在里维埃拉住下去。他可以在海上划船、捕捞海虾，我则专心于艺术创作。我先让你看看我的画再说吧。”

苏姗娜画画已有多年。深受诸多画家情人的影响，她广采众长，最后形成了自己独特的风格。她的线条仍画不好，但色彩感相当强。她让我看了几幅风景画，有一幅是她随母亲在昂儒省居住时画的，一幅画的是凡尔赛宫花园的小景，一幅画的是枫丹白露森林，还有一幅画的是巴黎近郊她所喜欢的街景。她的画朦朦胧胧，似海市蜃楼，却有一种鲜花般的美和一种非刻意雕琢的雅致。我对其中的一幅画产生了兴趣，同时为了取悦她，便提出想花钱买下。记不清那幅画是叫《林间空地》还是叫《白围巾》，时至今日也弄不清名称。我问了价钱，要价也很合理，于是决定购买。

“你真是个天使！”她乐得叫出了声，“这是我的第一笔交易。当然，画展结束后你才能拿到手。我要让此事上报纸，说你买下了这幅画。反正造造声势对你也没有害处嘛。很高兴你选中了这一幅——它恐怕是我最得意的作品了。”她拿起一面镜子，从镜子里端详这幅画。“很有情调，”她一边眯起眼睛欣赏一边说道，“这是谁都否认不了的。这几块绿色青翠欲滴，多么精致呀！中间点一笔白色，起到了画龙点睛的作用，将全部画面连接为一个整体。这不是才气是什么？！毫无疑问，这是地地道道的才气。”

看得出来，她朝着专业画家目标已走出了很远。

“哎呀，我的小宝贝，咱们聊得太久了，我得赶快干活去了。”

“我也得走了。”我说。

“顺带问一句[198]，那个可怜的拉里是不是仍然和那些红皮肤的人在一起？”

每次提到神的国度里的居民，她总是喜欢用这种鄙薄的口气。

“据我所知，情况的确如此。”

“拉里和蔼可亲、温文尔雅，他那种人和野蛮人在一起处境一定很艰难。如果电影里的情节可信的话，那些土匪、牛仔和墨西哥人可不是好惹的。倒不是说牛仔缺乏让你动心的吸引力。哎呀呀，可是，你上纽约的大街上去，口袋里不藏把枪，好像是极其危险的。”

她把我送到门口，在我的两颊上吻了吻。

“你我相处，开开心心的。日后多想着我点。”





六


我讲的故事到这里就结束了。拉里那边音讯全无，其实我也没指望能听到他的消息。他历来我行我素，由着自己的性子干事。想必他回到阔别多年的美国，先是在汽车修理厂找了份工作干，后来便当了个卡车司机四处跑，直至把这个国家了解个透。这一目标实现之后，他很可能会把他那奇怪的想法付诸实施——开出租车。那原本是在和我喝咖啡时开玩笑的一句话，但他如果当真做起来，我一点都不会感到稀奇。那以后我每次在纽约搭乘出租车，都要把司机扫一眼，想着说不定会看见拉里的那双深陷的庄重而含笑的眼睛，却始终没有看见过。后来第二次世界大战爆发，他年龄太大，当不成飞行员，但他很可能又去开卡车了，在国内或海外运输物资，要不然就是进工厂做工，尽自己的一份力量。有了闲暇时间，他很可能会著书立传，讲述自己的人生经验，向自己的同胞传经送宝。不过，对他而言，要完成一部书稿得花很长的时间。反正他有的是时间——岁月在他的身上没有留下印痕，不管从哪一方面说，他都仍然是个青年。

他没有野心，无意追名逐利。要他蝇营狗苟以成为社会名流，只会叫他大倒胃口。他按自己选择的道路生活，心安理得、随遇而安。他是个谦谦君子，不图为人之榜样。但他觉得可能有一些人会受到他的感召，和他具有同样炽热的激情和信仰——人生最大的满足感只能在精神生活中获取。他无私无欲、严于律己，走的是一条不断完善自我的道路，对旁人产生的影响无异于著书立传或传经布道。

我毕竟是个凡夫俗子，对于他的胸怀只能揣度一二。对于普通的饮食男女，我还是比较了解的。但对于拉里这样光彩夺目的人之翘楚，我只有敬仰的份儿，他之情怀及内心世界却不甚了了。拉里如其所愿，融入了喧嚣激荡的人海中——这茫茫的人海为错综复杂的利益和矛盾所纠缠，迷失于风雨飘摇的大世界，人们渴望美好的生活，外表笃定而内心彷徨，有善者也有恶者，有守财奴也有仗义疏财者。这，就是美利坚合众国的人民！关于拉里的故事，我只能讲这许多了，深知不足，却也只好如此了。完稿后，我觉得读者阅读此书，可能会迷茫，对故事的主旨有些摸不着头脑，于是便将这部长篇小说重温一遍，看能不能设计一个令人满意一点的结局。这一重温不当紧，我突然有所感悟，万分惊讶地发现，我虽无写“成功”之意，但此书却的确是一部关于“成功”的小说。书中跟我有关的主人公无不如愿以偿——艾略特成为社交界名流；伊莎贝尔有雄厚的经济基础，在一个生机勃勃、文化气氛浓郁的社区占有稳固的一席之地；格雷找到一个稳定而赚钱的职业，早晨九点上班，下午六点下班；苏姗娜·鲁维埃过上了衣食无忧的日子；索菲以死亡解脱；拉里寻觅到了幸福的归宿。那些自命不凡的人也许会吹毛求疵，但普通大众打心眼里还是喜欢“成功”小说的。就这一点而论，本故事的结局还算令人称心吧。

thus the wise say the path to Salvation is hard.

CHAPTER ONE


1


I have never begun a novel with more misgiving. If I call it a novel it is only because I don't know what else to call it.I have little story to tell and I end neither with a death nor a marriage.Death ends all things and so is the comprehensive conclusion of a story, but marriage finishes it very properly too and the sophisticated are ill-advised to sneer at what is by convention termed a happy ending.It is a sound instinct of the common people which persuades them that with this all that needs to be said is said.When male and female, after whatever vicissitudes you like, are at last brought together they have fulfilled their biological function and interest passes to the generation that is to come.But I leave my reader in the air.This book consists of my recollections of a man with whom I was thrown into close contact only at long intervals, and I have little knowledge of what happened to him in between.I suppose that by the exercise of invention I could fill the gaps plausibly enough and so make my narrative more coherent；but I have no wish to do that.I only want to set down what I know of my own knowledge.

Many years ago I wrote a novel called The Moon and Sixpence. In that I took a famous painter, Paul Gauguin, and, using the novelist's privilege, devised a number of incidents to illustrate the character I had created on the suggestions afforded me by the scanty facts I knew about the French artist.In the present book I have attempted to do nothing of the kind.I have invented nothing.To save embarrassment to people still living I have given to the persons who play a part in this story names of my own contriving, and I have in other ways taken pains to make sure that no one should recognize them.The man I am writing about is not famous.It may be that he never will be.It may be that when his life at last comes to an end he will leave no more trace of his sojourn on earth than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the surface of the water.Then my book, if it is read at all, will be read only for what intrinsic interest it may possess.But it may be that the way of life that he has chosen for himself and the peculiar strength and sweetness of his character may have an ever-growing influence over his fellow men so that, long after his death perhaps, it may be realized that there lived in this age a very remarkable creature.Then it will be quite clear of whom I write in this book and those who want to know at least a little about his early life may find in it something to their purpose.I think my book, within its acknowledged limitations, will be a useful source of information to my friend's biographers.

I do not pretend that the conversations I have recorded can be regarded as verbatim reports. I never kept notes of what was said on this or the other occasion, but I have a good memory for what concerns me, and though I have put these conversations in my own words they faithfully represent, I believe, what was said.I remarked a little while back that I have invented nothing；I want now to modify that statement.I have taken the liberty that historians have taken from the time of Herodotus to put into the mouths of the persons of my narrative speeches that I did not myself hear and could not possibly have heard.I have done this for the same reasons as the historians have, to give liveliness and verisimilitude to scenes that would have been ineffective if they had been merely recounted.I want to be read and I think I am justified in doing what I can to make my book readable.The intelligent reader will easily see for himself where I have used this artifice, and he is at perfect liberty to reject it.

Another reason that has caused me to embark upon this work with apprehension is that the persons I have chiefly to deal with are American. It is very difficult to know people and I don't think one can ever really know any but one's own countrymen.For men and women are not only themselves；they are also the region in which they were born, the city apartment or the farm in which they learnt to walk, the games they played as children, the old wives'tales they overheard, the food they ate, the schools they attended, the sports they followed, the poets they read, and the God they believed in.It is all these things that have made them what they are, and these are the things that you can't come to know by hearsay, you can only know them if you have lived them.You can only know them if you are them.And because you cannot know persons of a nation foreign to you except from observation, it is difficult to give them credibility in the pages of a book.Even so subtle and careful an observer as Henry James, though he lived in England for forty years, never managed to create an Englishman who was through and through English.For my part, except in a few short stories, I have never attempted to deal with any but my own countrymen, and if I have ventured to do otherwise in short stories it is because in them you can treat your characters more summarily.You give the reader broad indications and leave him to fill in the details.It may be asked why, if I turned Paul Gauguin into an Englishman, I could not do the same with the persons of this book.The answer is simple：I couldn't.They would not then have been the people they are.I do not pretend that they are American as Americans see themselves；they are American seen through an English eye.I have not attempted to reproduce the peculiarities of their speech.The mess English writers make when they try to do this is only equalled by the mess American writers make when they try to reproduce English as spoken in England.Slang is the great pitfall.Henry James in his English stories made constant use of it, but never quite as the English do, so that instead of getting the colloquial effect he was after, it too often gives the English reader an uncomfortable jolt.





2


In 1919 I happened to be in Chicago on my way to the Far East, and for reasons that have nothing to do with this narrative I was staying there for two or three weeks. I had recently brought out a successful novel and being for the moment news, I had no sooner arrived than I was interviewed.Next morning my telephone rang.I answered.

“Elliott Templeton speaking.”

“Elliott?I thought you were in Paris.”

“No, I'm visiting with my sister. We want you to come along and lunch with us today.”

“I should love to.”

He named the hour and gave me the address.

I had known Elliott Templeton for fifteen years. He was at this time in his late fifties, a tall, elegant man with good features and thick waving dark hair only sufficiently greying to add to the distinction of his appearance.He was always beautifully dressed.He got his haberdashery at Charvet's, but his suits, his shoes, and his hats in London.He had an apartment in Paris on the Rive Gauche in the fashionable Rue St.Guillaume.People who did not like him said he was a dealer, but this was a charge that he resented with indignation.He had taste and knowledge, and he did not mind admitting that in bygone years, when he first settled in Paris, he had given rich collectors who wanted to buy pictures the benefit of his advice；and when through his social connexions he heard that some impoverished nobleman, English or French, was disposed to sell a picture of first-rate quality he was glad to put him in touch with the directors of American museums who, he happened to know, were on the lookout for a fine example of such and such a master.There were many old families in France and some in England whose circumstances compelled them to part with a signed piece of Buhl or a writing-table made by Chippendale himself if it could be done quietly, and they were glad to know a man of great culture and perfect manners who could arrange the matter with discretion.One would naturally suppose that Elliott profited by the transactions, but one was too well bred to mention it.Unkind people asserted that everything in his apartment was for sale and that after he had invited wealthy Americans for an excellent lunch, with vintage wines, one or two of his valuable drawings would disappear, or a marquetry commode would be replaced by one in lacquer.When he was asked why a particular piece had vanished he very plausibly explained that he hadn't thought it quite up to his mark and had exchanged it for one of much finer quality.He added that it was tiresome always to look at the same things.

“Nous autres Américains, we Americans，”he said，“like change.It is at once our weakness and our strength.”

Some of the American ladies in Paris, who claimed to know all about him, said that his family was quite poor and if he was able to live in the way he did it was only because he had been very clever. I do not know how much money he had, but his ducal landlord certainly made him pay a lot for his apartment and it was furnished with objects of value.On the walls were drawings by the great French masters, Watteau, Fragonard, Claude Lorraine and so on；Savonnerie and Aubusson rugs displayed their beauty on the parquet floors；and in the drawing-room there was a Louis Quinze suite in petit point of such elegance that it might well have belonged, as he claimed, to Madame de Pompadour.Anyhow he had enough to live in what he considered was the proper style for a gentleman without trying to earn money, and the method by which he had done so in the past was a matter which, unless you wished to lose his acquaintance, you were wise not to refer to.Thus relieved of material cares he gave himself over to the ruling passion of his life, which was social relationships.His business connexions with the impecunious great both in France and in England had secured the foothold he had obtained on his arrival in Europe as a young man with letters of introduction to persons of consequence.His origins recommended him to the American ladies of title to whom he brought letters, for he was of an old Virginian family and through his mother traced his descent from one of the signatories of the Declaration of Independence.He was well-favoured, bright, a good dancer, a fair shot, and a fine tennis player.He was an asset at any party.He was lavish with flowers and expensive boxes of chocolates, and though he entertained little, when he did it was with an originality that pleased.It amused these rich ladies to be taken to bohemian restaurants in Soho or bistros in the Latin Quarter.He was always prepared to make himself useful, and there was nothing, however tiresome, that you asked him to do for you that he would not do with pleasure.He took an immense amount of trouble to make himself agreeable to ageing women, and it was not long before he was the ami de la maison, the household pet, in many an imposing mansion.His amiability was extreme；he never minded being asked at the last moment because someone had thrown you over and you could put him next to a very boring old lady and count on him to be as charming and amusing with her as he knew how.

In two or more years, both in London to which he went for the last part of the season and to pay a round of country house visits in the early autumn, and in Paris, where he had settled down, he knew everyone whom a young American could know. The ladies who had first introduced him into society were surprised to discover how wide the circle of his acquaintance had grown.Their feelings were mixed.On the one hand they were pleased that their young protégé had made so great a success, and on the other a trifle nettled that he should be on intimate terms with persons with whom their own relations had remained strictly formal.Though he continued to be obliging and useful to them, they were uneasily conscious that he had used them as stepping-stones to his social advancement.They were afraid he was a snob.And of course he was.He was a colossal snob.He was a snob without shame.He would put up with any affront, he would ignore any rebuff, he would swallow any rudeness to get asked to a party he wanted to go to or to make a connexion with some crusty old dowager of great name.He was indefatigable.When he had fixed his eye on his prey he hunted it with the persistence of a botanist who will expose himself to dangers of flood, earthquake, fever, and hostile natives to find an orchid of peculiar rarity.The war of 1914 gave him his final chance.When it broke out he joined an ambulance corps and served first in Flanders and then in the Argonne；he came back after a year with a red ribbon in his buttonhole and secured a position in the Red Cross in Paris.By then he was in affluent circumstances and he contributed generously to the good works patronized by persons of consequence.He was always ready with his exquisite taste and his gift for organization to help in any charitable function that was widely publicized.He became a member of the two most exclusive clubs in Paris.He was ce cher Elliott to the greatest ladies in France.He had finally arrived.

When I first met Elliott I was just a young author like another and he took no notice of me. He never forgot a face and when I ran across him here or there he shook hands with me cordially, but showed no desire to further our acquaintance；and if I saw him at the opera, say, he being with a person of high rank, he was apt not to catch sight of me.But then I happened to make a somewhat startling success as a playwright, and presently I became aware that Elliott regarded me with a warmer feeling.One day I received a note from him asking me to lunch at Claridge's, where he lived when in London.It was a small party and not a very smart one, and I conceived the notion that he was trying me out.But from then on, since my success had brought me many new friends, I began to see him more frequently.Shortly after this I spent some weeks of the autumn in Paris and met him at the house of a common acquaintance.He asked me where I was staying and in a day or two I received another invitation to lunch, this time at his apartment；when I arrived I was surprised to see that it was a party of considerable distinction.I giggled to myself.I knew that with his perfect sense of social relations he had realized that in English society as an author I was not of much account, but that in France, where an author just because he is an author has prestige, I was.During the years that followed our acquaintance became fairly intimate without ever developing into friendship.I doubt whether it was possible for Elliott Templeton to be a friend.He took no interest in people apart from their social position.When I chanced to be in Paris or he in London, he continued to ask me to parties when he wanted an extra man or was obliged to entertain travelling Americans.Some of these were, I suspected, old clients and some were strangers sent to him with letters of introduction.They were the cross of his life.He felt he had to do something for them and yet was unwilling to have them meet his grand friends.The best way of disposing of them of course was to give them dinner and take them to a play, but that was often difficult when he was engaged every evening for three weeks ahead, and also he had an inkling that they would scarcely be satisfied with that.Since I was an author and so of little consequence he didn't mind telling me his troubles on this matter.

“People in America are so inconsiderate in the way they give letters. It's not that I'm not delighted to see the people who are sent to me, but I really don't see why I should inflict them on my friends.”

He sought to make amends by sending them great baskets of roses and huge boxes of chocolates, but sometimes he had to do more. It was then, somewhat naïvely after what he had told me, that he asked me to come to the party he was organizing.

“They want to meet you so much，”he wrote to flatter me.“Mrs. So-and-so is a very cultivated woman and she's read every word you've written.”

Mrs. So-and-so would then tell me she'd so much enjoyed my book Mr.Perrin and Mr.Traill and congratulate me on my play The Mollusc.The first of these was written by Hugh Walpole and the second by Hubert Henry Davies.

If I have given the reader an impression that Elliott Templeton was a despicable character I have done him an injustice.

He was for one thing what the French call serviable, a word for which, so far as I know, there is no exact equivalent in English. The dictionary tells me that serviceable in the sense of helpful, obliging, and kind is archaic.That is just what Elliott was.He was generous, and though early in his career he had doubtless showered flowers, candy, and presents on his acquaintance from an ulterior motive, he continued to do so when it was no longer necessary.It caused him pleasure to give.He was hospitable.His chef was as good as any in Paris and you could be sure at his table of having set before you the earliest delicacies of the season.His wine proved the excellence of his judgement.It is true that his guests were chosen for their social importance rather than because they were good company, but he took care to invite at least one or two for their powers of entertainment, so that his parties were almost always amusing.People laughed at him behind his back and called him a filthy snob, but nevertheless accepted his invitations with alacrity.His French was fluent and correct and his accent perfect.He had taken great pains to adopt the manner of speech as it isspoken in England and you had to have a very sensitive ear to catch now and then an American intonation.He was a good talker if only you could keep him off the subject of dukes and duchesses, but even about them, now that his position was unassailable, he allowed himself, especially when you were alone with him, to be amusing.He had a pleasantly malicious tongue and there was no scandal about these exalted personages that did not reach his ears.From him I learnt who was the father of the Princess X's last child and who was the mistress of the Marquis de Y.I don't believe even Marcel Proust knew more of the inner life of the aristocracy than Elliott Templeton.

When I was in Paris we used often to lunch together, sometimes at his apartment and sometimes at a restaurant. I like to wander about the antiquity shops, occasionally to buy but more often to look, and Elliott was always enchanted to go with me.He had knowledge and a real love of beautiful objects.I think he knew every shop of the kind in Paris and was on familiar terms with the proprietor.He adored haggling and when we started out would say to me：

“If there's anything you want don't try to buy it yourself. Just give me a hint and let me do the rest.”

He would be delighted when he had got for me something I fancied for half the asking price. It was a treat to watch him bargain.He would argue, cajole, lose his temper, appeal to the seller's better nature, ridicule him, point out the defects of the object in question, threaten never to cross his threshold again, sigh, shrug his shoulders, admonish, start for the door in frowning anger, and when finally he had won his point shake his head sadly as though he accepted defeat with resignation.Then he would whisper to me in English.

“Take it with you. It would be cheap at double the money.”

Elliott was a zealous Catholic. He had not lived long in Paris before he met an abbé who was celebrated for his success in bringing infidels and heretics back to the fold.He was a great diner-out and a noted wit.He con-fined his ministrations to the rich and the aristocratic.It was inevitable that Elliott should be attracted by a man who, though of humble origins, was a welcome guest in the most exclusive houses, and he confided to a wealthy American lady who was one of the abbé’s recent converts that, though his family had always been Episcopalian, he had for long been interested in the Catholic Church.She asked Elliott to meet the abbé at dinner one evening, just three of them, and the abbé was scintillating.Elliott’s hostess brought the conversation around to Catholicism and the abbé spoke of it with unction, but without pedantry, as a man of the world, though a priest, speaking to another man of the world.Elliott was flattered to discover that the abbé knew all about him.

“The Duchesse de Vendôme was speaking of you the other day.She told me that she thought you highly intelligent.”

Elliott flushed with pleasure. He had been presented to Her Royal Highness, but it had never occurred to him that she would give him a second thought.The abbé spoke of the faith with wisdom and benignity；he was broad-minded, modern in his outlook, and tolerant.He made the Church seem to Elliott very like a select club that a well-bred man owed it to himself to belong to.Six months later he was received into it.His conversion, combined with the generosity he showed in his contributions to Catholic charities, opened several doors that had been closed to him before.

It may be that his motives in abandoning the faith of his fathers were mixed, but there could be no doubt of his devoutness when he had done so. He attended Mass every Sunday at the church frequented by the best people, went to confession regularly, and made periodical visits to Rome.In course of time he was rewarded for his piety by being made a papal chamberlain, and the assiduity with which he performed the duties of his office was rewarded by the order of, I think, the Holy Sepulchre.His career as a Catholic was in fact no less successful than his career as an homme du monde.

I often asked myself what was the cause of the snobbishness that obsessed this man who was so intelligent, so kindly, and so cultivated. He was no upstart.His father had been president of one of the southern universi-ties and his grandfather a divine of some eminence.Elliott was too clever not to see that many of the persons who accepted his invitations did so only to get a free meal and that of these some were stupid and some worthless.The glamour of their resounding titles blinded him to their faults.I can only guess that to be on terms of intimate familiarity with these gentlemen of ancient lineage, to be the faithful retainer of their ladies, gave him a sensation of triumph that never palled；and I think that at the back of it all was a passionate romanticism that led him to see in the weedy little French duke the crusader who had gone to the Holy Land with Saint Louis, and in the blustering, fox-hunting English earl the ancestor who had attended Henry the Eighth to the Field of the Cloth of Gold.In the company of such as these he felt that he lived in a spacious and gallant past.I think when he turned the pages of the Almanach de Gotha his heart beat warmly as one name after another brought back to him recollections of old wars, historic sieges, and celebrated duels, diplomatic intrigues, and the love affairs of kings.Such anyhow was Elliott Templeton.

I was having a wash and a brush-up before starting out to go to the luncheon Elliott had invited me to, when they rang up from the desk to say that he was below. I was a little surprised, but as soon as I was ready went down.

“I thought it would be safer if I came and fetched you，”he said as we shook hands.“I don't know how well you know Chicago.”

He had the feeling I have noticed in some Americans who have lived many years abroad that America is a difficult and even dangerous place in which the European cannot safely be left to find his way about by himself.

“It's early yet. We might walk part of the way，”he suggested.

There was a slight nip in the air, but not a cloud in the sky, and it was pleasant to stretch one's legs.

“I thought I'd better tell you about my sister before you meet her，”said Elliott as we walked along.“She's stayed with me once or twice in Paris, but I don't think you were there at the time. It's not a big party, you know.Only my sister and her daughter Isabel and Gregory Brabazon.”

“The decorator?”I asked.

“Yes. My sister's house is awful, and Isabel and I want her to have it done over.I happened to hear that Gregory was in Chicago and so I got her to ask him to lunch today.He's not quite a gentleman, of course, but he has taste.He did Raney Castle for Mary Olifant and St.Clement Talbot for the St.Erths.The duchess was delighted with him.You'll see Louisa's house for yourself.How she can have lived in it all these years I shall never understand.For the matter of that, how she can live in Chicago I shall never understand either.”

It appeared that Mrs. Bradley was a widow with three children, two sons and a daughter；but the sons were much older and married.One was in a government post in the Philippines, and the other, in the diplomatic service as his father had been, was at Buenos Aires.Mrs.Bradley's husband had occupied posts in various parts of the world, and after being first secretary in Rome for some years was made minister to one of the republics on the west coast of South America and had there died.

“I wanted Louisa to sell the house in Chicago when he passed over，”Elliott went on，“but she had a sentiment about it. It had been in the Bradley family for quite a long while.The Bradleys are one of the oldest families in Illinois.They came from Virginia in 1839 and took up land about sixty miles from what is now Chicago.They still own it.”Elliott hesitated a little and looked at me to see how I would take it.“The Bradley who settled here was what I suppose you might call a farmer.I'm not sure whether you know, but about the middle of last century, when the Middle West began to be opened up, quite a number of Virginians, younger sons of good family, you know, were tempted by the lure of the unknown to leave the flesh-pots of their native state.My brother-in-law's father, Chester Bradley, saw that Chicago had a future and entered a law office here.At all events he made enough money to leave his son very adequately provided for.”

Elliott's manner, rather than his words, suggested that perhaps it was not quite the thing for the late Chester Bradley to have left the stately mansion and the broad acres he had inherited to enter an office, but the fact that he had amassed a fortune at least partly compensated for it. Elliott was none too pleased when on a later occasion Mrs.Bradley showed me some snapshots of what he called their“place”in the country, and I saw a modest frame house with a pretty little garden, but with a barn and a cowhouse and hog pens within a stone's throw, surrounded by a desolate waste offlat fields.I couldn't help thinking that Mr.Chester Bradley knew what he was about when he abandoned this to make his way in the city.

Presently we hailed a taxi. It put us down before a brownstone house.Narrow and rather high, and you ascended to the front door by a flight of steep steps.It was in a row of houses, in a street that led off Lake Shore Drive, and its appearance, even on that bright autumn day, was so drab that you wondered how anyone could feel any sentiment about it.The door was opened by a tall and stout Negro butler with white hair, and we were ushered into the drawing-room.Mrs.Bradley got up from her chair as we came in and Elliott presented me to her.She must have been a handsome woman when young, for her features, though on the large side, were good, and she had fine eyes.But her sallowish face, almost agressively destitute of make-up, had sagged, and it was plain that she had lost the battle with the corpulence of middle age.I surmised that she was unwilling to accept defeat, for when she sat down she sat very erect in a straight-backed chair which the cruel armour of her corsets doubtless made more comfortable than an upholstered one.She wore a blue gown, heavily braided, and her high collar was stiff with whalebone.She had a fine head of white hair tightly marcelled and intricately dressed.Her other guest had not arrived and while waiting for him we talked of one thing and another.

“Elliott tells me that you came over by the southern route，”said Mrs. Bradley.“Did you stop in Rome?”

“Yes, I spent a week there.”

“And how is dear Queen Margherita?”

Somewhat surprised by her question, I said I didn't know.

“Oh, didn't you go and see her?Such a very nice woman. She was so kind to us when we were in Rome.Mr.Bradley was first secretary.Why didn't you go and see her?You're not like Elliott, so black that you can't go to the Quirinal?”

“Not at all，”I smiled.“The fact is I don't know her.”

“Don't you?”said Mrs. Bradley as though she could hardly believe her ears.“Why not?”

“To tell you the truth authors don't hobnob with kings and queens as a general rule.”

“But she's such a sweet woman，”Mrs. Bradley expostulated, as though it were very hoity-toity of me not to know that royal personage.“I'm sure you'd like her.”

At this moment the door was opened and the butler ushered in Gregory Brabazon.

Gregory Brabazon, notwithstanding his name, was not a romantic creature. He was a short, very fat man, as bald as an egg except for a ring of black curly hair round his ears and at the back of his neck, with a red, naked face that looked as though it were on the point of breaking out into a violent sweat, quick grey eyes, sensual lips, and a heavy jowl.He was an Englishman and I had sometimes met him at bohemian parties in London.He was very jovial, very hearty, and laughed a great deal, but you didn't have to be a great judge of character to know that his noisy friendliness was merely cover for a very astute man of business.He had been for some years the most successful decorator in London.He had a great booming voice and little fat hands that were wonderfully expressive.With telling gestures, with a spate of excited words he could thrill the imagination of a doubting client so that it was almost impossible to withhold the order he seemed to make it a favour to accept.

The butler came in again with a tray of cocktails.

“We won't wait for Isabel，”said Mrs. Bradley as she took one.

“Where is she?”asked Elliott.

“She went to play golf with Larry. She said she might be late.”

Elliott turned to me.

“Larry is Laurence Darrell. Isabel is supposed to be engaged to him.”

“I didn't know you drank cocktails, Elliott，'I said.

“I don't，”he answered grimly, as he sipped the one he had taken，“but in this barbarous land of prohibition what can one do?”He sighed.“They're beginning to serve them in some houses in Paris. Evil communications corrupt goodmanners.”

“Stuff and nonsense, Elliott，”said Mrs. Bradley.

She said it good-naturedly enough, but with a decision that suggested to me that she was a woman of character, and I suspected from the look she gave him, amused but shrewd, that she had no illusions about him. I wondered what she would make of Gregory Brabazon.I had caught the professional look he gave the room as he came in and the involuntary lifting of his bushy eyebrows.It was indeed an amazing room.The paper on the walls, the cretonne of the curtains and on the upholstered furniture were of the same pattern；on the walls were oil paintings in massive gold frames that the Bradleys had evidently bought when they were in Rome.Virgins of the school of Raphael, Virgins of the school of Guido Reni, landscapes of the school of Zuccarelli, ruins of the school of Pannini.There were trophies of their sojourn in Peking, blackwood tables too profusely carved, huge cloisonné vases, and there were the purchases they had made in Chile or Peru, obese figures in hard stone and earthenware vases.There was a Chippendale writing-table and a marquetry vitrine.The lamp-shades were of white silk on which some ill-advised artist had painted shepherds and shepherdesses in Watteau costumes.It was hideous and yet, I don’t know why, agreeable.It had a homely, lived-in air, and you felt that that incredible jumble had a significance.All those incongruous objects belonged together because they were part of Mrs.Bradley’s life.

We had finished our cocktails when the door was flung open and a girl came in, followed by a boy.

“Are we late?”she asked.“I've brought Larry back. Is there anything for him to eat?”

“I expect so，”smiled Mrs. Bradley.“Ring the bell and tell Eugene to put another place.”

“He opened the door for us. I've already told him.”

“This is my daughter Isabel，”said Mrs. Bradley, turning to me.“And this is Laurence Darrell.”

Isabel gave me a rapid handshake and turned impetuously to Gregory Brabazon.

“Are you Mr. Brabazon?I've been crazy to meet you.I love what you've done for Clementine Dormer.Isn't this room terrible?I've been trying to get Mamma to do something about it for years and now you're in Chicago it’s our chance.Tell me honestly what you think of it.”

I knew that was the last thing Brabazon would do. He gave Mrs.Bradley a quick glance, but her impassive face told him nothing.He decided that Isabel was the person who counted and broke into a boisterous laugh.

“I'm sure it's very comfortable and all that，”he said，“but if you ask me point-blank, well, I do think it's pretty awful.”

Isabel was a tall girl with the oval face, straight nose, fine eyes, and full mouth that appeared to be characteristic of the family. She was comely though on the fat side, which I ascribed to her age, and I guessed that she would fine down as she grew older.She had strong, good hands, though they also were a trifle fat, and her legs, displayed by her short skirt, were fat too.She had a good skin and a high colour, which exercise and the drive back in an open car had doubtless heightened.She was sparkling and vivacious.Her radiant health, her playful gaiety, her enjoyment of life, the happiness you felt in her were exhilarating.She was so natural that she made Elliott, for all his elegance, look rather tawdry.Her freshness made Mrs.Bradley, with her pasty, lined face, look tired and old.

We went down to lunch. Gregory Brabazon blinked when he saw the dining-room.The walls were papered with a dark red paper that imitated stuff and hung with portraits of grim, sour-faced men and women, very badly painted, who were the immediate forebears of the late Mr.Bradley.He was there, too, with a heavy moustache, very stiff in a frock coat and a white starched collar.Mrs.Bradley, painted by a French artist of the nineties, hung over the chimney-piece in full evening dress of pale blue satin with pearls around her neck and a diamond star in her hair.With one bejewelled hand she fingered a lace scarf so carefully painted that you could count every stitch and with the other negligently held an ostrich-feather fan.The furniture, of black oak, was overwhelming.

“What do you think of it?”asked Isabel of Gregory Brabazon as we sat down.

“I'm sure it cost a great deal of money，”he answered.

“It did，”said Mrs. Bradley.“It was given to us as a wedding present by Mr.Bradley's father.It's been all over theworld with us.Lisbon, Peking, Quito, Rome.Dear Queen Margherita admired it very much.”

“What would you do if it was yours?”Isabel asked Brabazon, but before he could answer, Elliott answered for him.

“Burn it，”he said.

The three of them began to discuss how they would treat the room. Elliott was all for Louis Quinze, while Isabel wanted a refectory table and Italian chairs.Brabazon thought Chippendale would be more in keeping with Mrs.Bradley's personality.

“I always think that's so important，”he said，“a person's personality.”He turned to Elliott.“Of course you know the Duchess of Olifant?”

“Mary?She's one of my most intimate friends.”

“She wanted me to do her dining-room and the moment I saw her I said George the Second.”

“How right you were. I noticed the room the last time I dined there.It's in perfect taste.”

So the conversation went on. Mrs.Bradley listened, but you could not tell what she was thinking.I said little, and Isabel's young man, Larry, I'd forgotten his surname, said nothing at all.He was sitting on the other side of the table between Brabazon and Elliott and every now and then I glanced at him.He looked very young.He was about the same height as Elliott, just under six feet, thin and loose-limbed.He was a pleasant-looking boy, neither handsome nor plain, rather shy and in no way remarkable.I was interested in the fact that though, so far as I could remember, he hadn't said half a dozen words since entering the house, he seemed perfectly at ease and in a curious way appeared to take part in the conversation without opening his mouth.I noticed his hands.They were long, but not large for his size, beautifully shaped and at the same time strong.I thought that a painter would be pleased to paint them.He was slightly built but not delicate in appearance；on the contrary I should have said he was wiry and resistant.His face, grave in repose, was tanned, but otherwise there was little colour in it, and his features, though regular enough, were undistinguished.He had rather high cheekbones and his temples were hollow.He had dark brown hair with a slight wave in it.His eyes looked larger than they really were because they were deep set in the orbits and his lashes were thick and long.His eyes were peculiar, not of the rich hazel that Isabel shared with her mother and her uncle, but so dark that the iris made one colour with the pupil, and this gave them a peculiar intensity.He had a natural grace that was attractive and I could see why Isabel had been taken by him.Now and again her glance rested on him for a moment and I seemed to see in her expression not only love but fondness.Their eyes met and there was in his a tenderness that was beautiful to see.There is nothing more touching than the sight of young love, and I, a middle-aged man then, envied them, but at the same time, I couldn't imagine why, I felt sorry for them.It was silly because, so far as I knew, there was no impediment to their happiness；their circumstances seemed easy and there was no reason why they should not marry and live happily ever afterwards.

Isabel, Elliott, and Gregory Brabazon went on talking of the redecoration of the house, trying to get out of Mrs. Bradley at least an admission that something should be done, but she only smiled amiably.

“You mustn't try to rush me. I want to have time to think it over.”She turned to the boy.“What do you think of it all, Larry?”

He looked round the table, a smile in his eyes.

“I don't think it matters one way or the other，”he said.

“You beast, Larry，”cried Isabel.“I particularly told you to back us up.”

“If Aunt Louisa is happy with what she's got, what is the object of changing?”

His question was so much to the point and so sensible that it made me laugh. He looked at me then and smiled.

“And don't grin like that just because you've made a very stupid remark，”said Isabel.

But he only grinned the more, and I noticed then that he had small and white and regular teeth. There was something in the look he gave Isabel that made her flush and catch her breath.Unless I was mistaken she was madly in love with him, but I don't know what it was that gave me the feeling that in her love for him there was also somethingmaternal.It was a little unexpected in so young a girl.With a soft smile on her lips she directed her attention once more to Gregory Brabazon.

“Don't pay any attention to him. He's very stupid and entirely uneducated.He doesn't know anything about anything except flying.”

“Flying?”I said.

“He was an aviator in the war.”

“I should have thought he was too young to have been in the war.”

“He was. Much too young.He behaved very badly.He ran away from school and went to Canada.By lying his head off he got them to believe he was eighteen and got into the air corps.He was fighting in France at the time of the armistice.”

“You're boring your mother's guests, Isabel，”said Larry.

“I've known him all my life, and when he came back he looked lovely in his uniform, with all those pretty ribbons on his tunic, so I just sat on his doorstep, so to speak, till he consented to marry me just to have a little peace and quiet. The competition was awful.”

“Really, Isabel，”said her mother.

Larry leant over towards me.

“I hope you don't believe a word she says. Isabel isn't a bad girl really, but she's a liar.”

Luncheon was finished and soon after Elliott and I left. I had told him before that I was going to the museum to look at the pictures and he said he would take me, I don't particularly like going to a gallery with anyone else, but I could not say I would sooner go alone, so I accepted his company.On our way we spoke of Isabel and Larry.

“It's rather charming to see two young things so much in love with one another，”I said.

“They're much too young to marry.”

“Why?It's such fun to be young and in love and to marry.”

“Don't be ridiculous. She's nineteen and he's only just twenty.He hasn't got a job.He has a tiny income, three thousand a year Louisa tells me, and Louisa's not a rich woman by any manner of means.She needs all she has.”

“Well, he can get a job.”

“That's just it. He's not trying to.He seems to be quite satisfied to do nothing.”

“I dare say he had a pretty rough time in the war. He may want a rest.”

“He's been resting for a year. That's surely long enough.”

“I thought he seemed a nice sort of boy.”

“Oh, I have nothing against him. He's quite well born and all that sort of thing.His father came from Baltimore.He was assistant professor of Romance languages at Yale or something like that.His mother was a Philadelphian of old Quaker stock.”

“You speak of them in the past. Are they dead?”

“Yes, his mother died in childbirth and his father about twelve years ago. He was brought up by an old college friend of his father's who's a doctor at Marvin.That's how Louisa and Isabel knew him.”

“Where's Marvin?”

“That's where the Bradley place is. Louisa spends the summer there.She was sorry for the child.Dr.Nelson's a bachelor and didn't know the first thing about bringing up a boy.It was Louisa who insisted that he should be sent to St.Paul's and she always had him out here for his Christmas vacation.”Elliott shrugged a Gallic shoulder.“I should have thought she would foresee the inevitable result.”

We had now arrived at the museum and our attention was directed to the pictures. Once more I was impressed by Elliott's knowledge and taste.He shepherded me around the rooms as though I were a group of tourists, and no professor of art could have discoursed more instructively than he did.Making up my mind to come again by myself when I could wander at will and have a good time, I submitted；after a while he looked at his watch.

“Let us go，”he said.“I never spend more than one hour in a gallery. That is as long as one's power of appreciation persists.We will finish another day.”

I thanked him warmly when we separated. I went my way perhaps a wiser but certainly a peevish man.

When I was saying good-bye to Mrs. Bradley she told me that next day Isabel was having a few of her young friends in to dinner and they were going on to dance afterwards, and if I would come Elliott and I could have a talk when they had gone.

“You'll be doing him a kindness，”she added.“He's been abroad so long, he feels rather out of it here. He doesn't seem able to find anyone he has anything in common with.”

I accepted and before we parted on the museum steps Elliott told me he was glad I had.

“I'm like a lost soul in this great city，”he said.“I promised Louisa to spend six weeks with her, we hadn't seen one another since 1912，but I'm counting the days till I can get back to Paris. It's the only place in the world for a civilized man to live.My dear fellow, d'you know how they look upon me here?They look upon me as a freak.Savages.”

I laughed and left.

The following evening, having refused Elliott's telephoned offer to fetch me, I arrived quite safely at Mrs. Bradley's house.I had been delayed by someone who had come to see me and was a trifle late.So much noise came from the sitting-room as I walked upstairs that I thought it must be a large party and I was surprised to find that there were, including myself, only twelve people.Mrs.Bradley was very grand in green satin with a dog-collar of seed pearls round her neck, and Elliott in his well-cut dinner jacket looked elegant as he alone could look.When he shook hands with me my nostrils were assailed by all the perfumes of Arabia.I was introduced to a stoutish, tall man with a red face who looked somewhat ill at ease in evening clothes.He was a Dr.Nelson, but at the moment that meant nothing to me.The rest of the party consisted of Isabel's friends, but their names escaped me as soon as I heard them.The girls were young and pretty and the men young and upstanding.None of them made any impression on me except one boy and that only because he was so tall and so massive.He must have been six foot three or four and he had great broad shoulders.Isabel was looking very pretty；she was dressed in white silk, with a long, hobbled skirt that concealed her fat legs；the cut of her frock showed that she had well-developed breasts；her bare arms were a trifle fat, but her neck was lovely.She was excited and her fine eyes sparkled.There was no doubt about it, she was a very pretty and desirable young woman, but it was obvious that unless she took care she would develop an unbecoming corpulence.

At dinner I found myself placed between Mrs. Bradley and a shy drab girl who seemed even younger than the others.As we sat down, to make the way easier Mrs.Bradley explained that her grandparents lived at Marvin and that she and Isabel had been at school together.Her name, the only one I heard mentioned, was Sophie.A lot of chaff was bandied across the table, everyone talked at the top of his voice and there was a great deal of laughter.They seemed to know one another very well.When I was not occupied with my hostess I attempted to make conversation with my neighbour, but I had no great success.She was quieter than the rest.She was not pretty, but she had an amusing face, with a little tilted nose, a wide mouth, and greenish blue eyes；her hair, simply done, was of a sandy brown.She was very thin and her chest was almost as flat as a boy's.She laughed at the badinage that went on, but in a manner that was a little forced so that you felt she wasn't as much amused as she pretended to be.I guessed that she was making an effort to be a good sport.I could not make out if she was a trifle stupid or only painfully timid and, having tried various topics of conversation only to have them dropped, for want of anything better to say I asked her to tell me who all the people at table were.

“Well, you know Dr. Nelson，”she said, indicating the middle-aged man who was opposite me on Mrs.Bradley's other side.“He's Larry's guardian.He's our doctor at Marvin.He's very clever, he invents gadgets for planes that no one will have anything to do with, and when he isn’t doing that he drinks.”

There was a gleam in her pale eyes as she said this that made me suspect that there was more in her than I had at first supposed. She went on to give me the names of one young thing after another, telling me who their parents were, and in the case of the men what college they had been to and what work they did.It wasn't very illuminating.

“She's very sweet，”or：“He's a very good golfer.”

“And who is that big fellow with the eyebrows?”

“That?Oh, that's Gray Maturin. His father's got an enormous house on the river at Marvin.He's our millionaire.We're very proud of him.He gives us class.Maturin, Hobbes, Rayner, and Smith.He's one of the richest men in Chicago and Gray’s his only son.”

She put such a pleasant irony into that list of names that I gave her an inquisitive glance. She caught it and flushed.

“Tell me more about Mr. Maturin.”

“There's nothing to tell. He's rich.He's highly respected.He built us a new church at Marvin and he's given a million dollars to the University of Chicago.”

“His son's a fine-looking fellow.”

“He's nice. You'd never think his grandfather was shanty Irish and his grandmother a Swedish waitress in an eating house.”

Gray Maturin was striking rather than handsome. He had a rugged, unfinished look；a short blunt nose, a sensual mouth, and the florid Irish complexion；a great quantity of raven black hair, very sleek, and under heavy eyebrows clear, very blue eyes.Though built on so large a scale he was finely proportioned, and stripped he must have been a fine figure of a man.He was obviously very powerful.His virility was impressive.He made Larry who was sitting next to him, though only three or four inches shorter, look puny.

“He's very much admired，”said my shy neighbour.“I know several girls who would stop at nothing short of murder to get him. But they haven't a chance.”

“Why not?”

“You don't know anything, do you?”

“How should I?”

“He's so much in love with Isabel, he can't see straight, and Isabel's in love with Larry.”

“What's to prevent him from setting to and cutting Larry out?”

“Larry's his best friend.”

“I suppose that complicates matters.”

“If you're as high-principled as Gray is.”

I was not sure whether she said this in all seriousness or whether there was in her tone a hint of mockery. There was nothing saucy in her manner, forward or pert, and yet I got the impression that she was lacking neither in humour nor in shrewdness.I wondered what she was really thinking while she made conversation with me, but that I knew I should never find out.She was obviously unsure of herself and I conceived the notion that she was an only child who had lived a secluded life with people a great deal older than herself.There was a modesty, an unobtrusiveness about her that I found engaging, but if I was right in thinking that she had lived much alone I guessed that she had quietly observed the older persons she lived with and had formed decided opinions upon them.We who are of mature age seldom suspect how unmercifully and yet with what insight the very young judge us.I looked again into her greenish blue eyes.

“How old are you?”I asked.

“Seventeen.”

“Do you read much?”I asked at a venture.

But before she could answer, Mrs. Bradley, attentive to her duties as a hostess, drew me to her with some remark and before I could disengage myself dinner was at an end.The young people went off at once to wherever they were going and the four of us who were left went up to the sitting-room.

I was surprised that I had been asked to this party, for after a little desultory conversation they began to talk of a matter that I should have thought they would have preferred to discuss in private. I could not make up my mind whether it would be more discreet in me to get up and go or whether, as a disinterested audience of one, I was useful to them.The question at issue was Larry's odd disinclination to go to work, and it had been brought to a point by an offer from Mr.Maturin, the father of the boy who had been at dinner, to take him into his office.It was a fine opportunity.With ability and industry Larry could look forward to making in due course a great deal of money.Young Gray Maturin was eager for him to take it.

I cannot remember all that was said, but the gist of it is clear in my memory. On Larry's return from France Dr.Nelson, his guardian, had suggested that he should go to college, but he had refused.It was natural that he should want to do nothing for a while；he had had a hard time and had been twice, though not severely, wounded.Dr.Nelson thought that he was still suffering from shock and it seemed a good idea that he should rest till he had completely recovered.But the weeks passed into months and now it was over a year since he'd been out of uniform.It appeared that he had done well in the air corps and on his return he cut something of a figure in Chicago, the result of which was that several business men offered him positions.He thanked them, but refused.He gave no reason except that he hadn't made up his mind what he wanted to do.He became engaged to Isabel.This was no surprise to Mrs.Bradley since they had been inseparable for years and she knew that Isabel was in love with him.She was fond of him and thought he would make Isabel happy.

“Her character's stronger than his. She can give him just what he lacks.”

Though they were both so young Mrs. Bradley was quite willing that they should marry at once, but she wasn't prepared for them to do so until Larry had gone to work.He had a little money of his own, but even if he had had ten times more than he had she would have insisted on this.So far as I could gather, what she and Elliott wished to find out from Dr.Nelson was what Larry intended to do.They wanted him to use his influence to get him to accept the job that Mr.Maturin offered him.

“You know I never had much authority over Larry，”he said.“Even as a boy he went his own way.”

“I know. You let him run wild.It's a miracle he's turned out as well as he has.”

Dr. Nelson, who had been drinking quite heavily, gave her a sour look.His red face grew a trifle redder.

“I was very busy. I had my own affairs to attend to.I took him because there was nowhere else for him to go and his father was a friend of mine.He wasn't easy to do anything with.”

“I don't know how you can say that，”Mrs. Bradley answered tartly.“He has a very sweet disposition.”

“What are you to do with a boy who never argues with you, but does exactly what he likes and when you get mad at him just says he's sorry and lets you storm?If he'd been my own son I could have beaten him. I couldn't beat a boy who hadn't got a relation in the world and whose father had left him to me because he thought I'd be kind to him.”

“That's neither here nor there，”said Elliott, somewhat irritably.“The position is this：he's dawdled around long enough；he's got a fine chance of a position in which he stands to make a lot of money, and if he wants to marry Isabel he must take it.”

“He must see that in the present state of the world，”Mrs. Bradley put in，“a man has to work.He's perfectly strong and well now.We all know how after the war between the States, there were men who never did a stroke after they came back from it.They were a burden to their families and useless to the community.”

Then I added my word.

“But what reason does he give for refusing the various offers that are made him?”

“None. Except that they don't appeal to him.”

“But doesn't he want to do anything?”

“Apparently not.”

Dr. Nelson helped himself to another highball.He took a long drink and then looked at his two friends.

“Shall I tell you what my impression is?I dare say I'm not a great judge of human nature, but at any rate afterthirty-odd years of practice I think I know something about it. The war did something to Larry.He didn't come back the same person that he went.It's not only that he's older.Something happened that changed his personality.”

“What sort of thing?”I asked.

“I wouldn't know. He's very reticent about his war experiences.”Dr.Nelson turned to Mrs.Bradley.“Has he ever talked to you about them, Louisa?”

She shook her head.

“No. When he first came back we tried to get him to tell us some of his adventures, but he only laughed in that way of his and said there was nothing to tell.He hasn't even told Isabel.She's tried and tried, but she hasn't got a thing out of him.”

The conversation went on in this unsatisfactory way and presently Dr. Nelson, looking at his watch, said he must go.I prepared to leave with him, but Elliott pressed me to stay.When he had gone, Mrs.Bradley apologized for troubling me with their private affairs and expressed her fear that I had been bored.

“But you see it's all very much on my mind，”she finished.

“Mr. Maugham is very discreet, Louisa；you needn't be afraid of telling him anything.I haven't the feeling that Bob Nelson and Larry are very close, but there are some things that Louisa and I thought we'd better not mention to him.”

“Elliott.”

“You've told him so much, you may as well tell him the rest. I don't know whether you noticed Gray Maturin at dinner?”

“He's so big, one could hardly fail to.”

“He's a beau of Isabel's. All the time Larry was away he was very attentive.She likes him, and if the war had lasted much longer she might very well have married him.He proposed to her.She didn't accept and she didn't refuse.Louisa guessed she didn't want to make up her mind till Larry came home.”

“How is it that he wasn't in the war?”I asked.

“He strained his heart playing football. It's nothing serious, but the army wouldn't take him.Anyhow when Larry came home he had no chance.Isabel turned him down flat.”

I didn't know what I was expected to say to that, so I said nothing. Elliott went on.With his distinguished appearance and his Oxford accent he couldn't have been more like an official of high standing at the Foreign Office.

“Of course Larry's a very nice boy and it was damned sporting of him to run away and join the air corps, but I'm a pretty good judge of character……”He gave a knowing little smile and made the only reference I ever heard him make to the fact that he had made a fortune by dealing in works of art.“Otherwise I shouldn't have at this moment a tidy sum in gilt-edged securities. And my opinion is that Larry will never amount to very much.He has no money to speak of and no standing.Gray Maturin is a very different proposition.He has a good old Irish name.They've had a bishop in the family, and a dramatist and several distinguished soldiers and scholars.”

“How do you know all that?”I asked.

“It's the sort of thing one knows，”he answered casually.“As a matter of fact I happened to be glancing through the Dictionary of National Biography the other day at the club and I came across the name.”

I didn't think it was my business to repeat what my neighbour at dinner had told me of the shanty Irishman and the Swedish waitress who were Gray's grandfather and grandmother. Elliott proceeded.

“We've all known Henry Maturin for many years. He's a very fine man and a very rich one.Gray's stepping into the best brokerage house in Chicago.He's got the world at his feet.He wants to marry Isabel and one can't deny that from her point of view it would be a very good match.I’m all in favour of it myself and I know Louisa is too.”

“You've been away from America so long, Elliott，”said Mrs. Bradley, with a dry smile，“You've forgotten that in this country girls don't marry because their mothers and their uncles are in favour of it.”

“That is nothing to be proud of, Louisa，”said Elliott sharply.“As the result of thirty years'experience I may tellyou that a marriage arranged with proper regard to position, fortune, and community of circumstances has every advantage over a love match. In France, which after all is the only civilized country in the world, Isabel would marry Gray without thinking twice about it；then, after a year or two, if she wanted it, she'd take Larry as her lover.Gray would install a prominent actress in a luxurious apartment, and everyone would be perfectly happy.”

Mrs. Bradley was no fool.She looked at her brother with sly amusement.

“The objection to that, Elliott, is that as the New York plays only come here for limited periods, Gray could only hope to keep the tenants of his luxurious apartment for a very uncertain length of time. That would surely be very unsettling for all parties.”

Elliott smiled.

“Gray could buy a seat on the New York stock exchange. After all, if you must live in America I can't see any object in living anywhere but in New York.”

I left soon after this, but before I did Elliott, I hardly know why, asked me if I would lunch with him to meet the Maturins, father and son.

“Henry is the best type of the American businessman，”he said，“and I think you ought to know him. He's looked after our investments for many years.”

I hadn't any particular wish to do this, but no reason to refuse, so I said I would be glad to.

I had been put up for the length of my stay at a club which possessed a good library, and next morning I went there to look at one or two of the university magazines that for the person who does not subscribe to them have always been rather hard to come by. It was early and there was only one other person there.He was seated in a big leather chair absorbed in a book.I was surprised to see it was Larry.He was the last person I should have expected to find in such a place.He looked up as I passed, recognized me and made as if to get up.

“Don't move，”I said, and then almost automatically：“What are you reading?”

“A book，”he said, with a smile, but a smile so engaging that the rebuff of his answer was in no way offensive.

He closed it and looking at me with his peculiarly opaque eyes held it so that I couldn't see the title.

“Did you have a good time last night?”I asked.

“Wonderful. Didn't get home till five.”

“It's very strenuous of you to be here so bright and early.”

“I come here a good deal. Generally I have the place to myself at this time.”

“I won't disturb you.”

“You're not disturbing me，”he said, smiling again, and now it occurred to me that he had a smile of great sweetness. It was not a brilliant, flashing smile, it was a smile that lit his face as with an inner light.He was sitting in an alcove made by jutting out shelves and there was a chair next to him.He put his hand on the arm.“Won't you sit down for a minute?”

“All right.”

He handed me the book he was holding.

“That's what I was reading.”

I looked at it and saw it was William James's Principles of Psychology. It is, of course, a standard work and important in the history of the science with which it deals；it is moreover exceedingly readable；but it is not the sort of book I should have expected to see in the hands of a very young man, an aviator, who had been dancing till five in the morning.

“Why are you reading this?”I asked.

“I'm very ignorant.”

“You're also very young，”I smiled.

He did not speak for so long a time that I began to find the silence awkward and I was on the point of getting up and looking for the magazines I had come to find. But I had a feeling that he wanted to say something.He looked into vacancy, his face grave and intent, and seemed to meditate.I waited.I was curious to know what it was all about.When he began to speak it was as though he were continuing the conversation without awareness of that long silence.

“When I came back from France they all wanted me to go to college. I couldn't.After what I'd been through I felt I couldn't go back to school.I learnt nothing at my prep school anyway.I felt I couldn't enter into a fresh-man's life.They wouldn’t have liked me.I didn’t want to act a part I didn’t feel.And I didn’t think the instructors would teach me the sort of things I wanted to know.”

“Of course I know this is no business of mine，”I answered，“but I'm not convinced you were right. I think I understand what you mean and I can see that, after being in the war for two years, it would have been rather a nuisance to become the sort of glorified schoolboy an undergraduate is during his first and second years.I can't believe they wouldn't have liked you.I don't know much about American universities, but I don't believe American undergraduates are very different from English ones, perhaps a little more boisterous and a little more inclined to horseplay, but on the whole very decent, sensible boys, and I take it that if you don’t want to lead their lives they’re quite willing, if you exercise a little tact, to let you lead yours.I never went to Cambridge as my brothers did.I had the chance, but I refused it.I wanted to get out into the world.I’ve always regretted it.I think it would have saved me a lot of mistakes.You learn more quickly under the guidance of experienced teachers.You waste a lot of time going down blind alleys if you have no one to lead you.”

“You may be right. I don't mind if I make mistakes.It may be that in one of the blind alleys I may find something to my purpose.”

“What is your purpose?”

He hesitated a moment.

“That's just it. I don't quite know it yet.”

I was silent, for there didn't seem to be anything to say in answer to that. I, who from a very early age have always had before me a clear and definite purpose, was inclined to feel impatient, but I chid myself；I had what I can only call an intuition that there was in the soul of that boy some confused striving, whether of half-thought-out ideas or of dimly felt emotions I could not tell, which filled him with a restlessness that urged him he did not know whither.He strangely excited my sympathy.I had never before heard him speak much and it was only now that I became conscious of the melodiousness of his voice.It was very persuasive.It was like balm.When I considered that, his engaging smile, and the expressiveness of his very black eyes I could well understand that Isabel was in love with him.There was indeed something very lovable about him.He turned his head and looked at me without embarrassment, but with an expression in his eyes that was at once scrutinizing and amused.

“Am I right in thinking that after we all went off to dance last night you talked about me?”

“Part of the time.”

“I thought that was why Uncle Bob had been pressed to come to dinner. He hates going out.”

“It appears that you've got the offer of a very good job.”

“A wonderful job.”

“Are you going to take it?”

“I don't think so.”

“Why not?”

“I don't want to.”

I was butting into an affair that was no concern of mine, but I had a notion that just because I was a stranger from a foreign country Larry was not disinclined to talk to me about it.

“Well, you know when people are no good at anything else they become writers，”I said, with a chuckle.

“I have no talent.”

“Then what do you want to do?”

He gave me his radiant, fascinating smile.

“Loaf，”he said.

I had to laugh.

“I shouldn't have thought Chicago the best place in the world to do that in，”I said.“Anyhow, I'll leave you to your reading. I want to have a look at the Yale Quarterly.”

I got up. When I left the library Larry was still absorbed in William James's book.I lunched by myself at the club and since it was quiet in the library went back there to smoke my cigar and idle an hour or two away, reading and writing letters.I was surprised to see Larry still immersed in his book.He looked as if he hadn't moved since I left him.He was still there when about four I went away.I was struck by his evident power of concentration.He had neither noticed me go nor come.I had various things to do during the afternoon and did not go back to the Blackstone till it was time to change for the dinner party I was going to.On my way I was seized with an impulse of curiosity.I dropped into the club once more and went into the library.There were quite a number of people there then, reading the papers and what not.Larry was still sitting in the same chair, intent on the same book.Odd！

Next day Elliott asked me to lunch at the Palmer House to meet the elder Maturin and his son. We were only four.Henry Maturin was a big man, nearly as big as his son, with a red fleshy face and a great jowl, and he had the same blunt aggressive nose, but his eyes were smaller than his son's, not so blue and very, very shrewd.Though he could not have been much more than fifty he looked ten years older and his hair, rapidly thinning, was snow-white.At first sight he was not prepossessing.He looked as though for many years he had done himself too well, and I received the impression of a brutal, clever, competent man who, in business matters at all events, would be pitiless.At first he said little and I had a notion that he was taking my measure.I could not but perceive that he looked upon Elliott as something of a joke.Gray, amiable and polite, was almost completely silent, and the party would have been sticky if Elliott, with his perfect social tact, hadn't kept up a flow of easy conversation.I guessed that in the past he had acquired a good deal of experience in dealing with Middle Western businessmen who had to be cajoled into paying a fancy price for an old master.Presently Mr.Maturin began to feel more at his ease and he made one or two remarks that showed he was brighter than he looked and indeed had a dry sense of humour.For a while the conversation turned on stocks and shares.I should have been surprised to discover that Elliott was very knowledgeable on the subject if I had not long been aware that for all his nonsense he was nobody's fool.It was then that Mr.Maturin remarked：

“I had a letter from Gray's friend Larry Darrell this morning.”

“You didn't tell me, Dad，”said Gray.

Mr. Maturin turned to me.

“You know Larry, don't you?”I nodded.“Gray persuaded me to take him into my business. They're great friends.Gray thinks the world of him，”

“What did he say, Dad?”

“He thanked me. He said he realized it was a great chance for a young fellow and he'd thought it over very carefully and come to the conclusion he'd have been a disappointment to me and thought it better to refuse.”

“That's very foolish of him，”said Elliott.

“It is，”said Mr. Maturin.

“I'm awfully sorry, Dad，”said Gray.“It would have been grand if we could have worked together.”

“You can lead a horse to the water, but you can't make him drink.”

Mr. Maturin looked at his son while he said this and his shrewd eyes softened.I realized that there was anotherside to the hard businessman；he doted on this great hulking son of his.He turned to me once more.

“D'you know, that boy did our course in two under par on Sunday. He beat me seven and six.I could have brained him with my niblick.And to think that I taught him to play golf myself.”

He was brimming over with pride. I began to like him.

“I had a lot of luck, Dad.”

“Not a bit of it. Is it luck when you get out of a bunker and lay your ball six inches from the hole?Thirty-five yards if it was an inch, the shot was.I want him to go into the amateur championship next year.”

“I shouldn't be able to spare the time.”

“I'm your boss, ain't I?”

“Don't I know it！The hell you raise if I'm a minute late at the office.”

Mr. Maturin chuckled.

“He's trying to make me out a tyrant，”he said to me.“Don't you believe him. I'm my business, my partners are no good, and I'm very proud of my business.I've started this boy of mine at the bottom and I expect him to work his way up just like any young fellow I’ve hired, so that when the time comes for him to take my place he’ll be ready for it.It’s a great responsibility, a business like mine.I’ve looked after the investments of some of my clients for thirty years and they trust me.To tell you the truth, I’d rather lose my own money than see them lose theirs.”

Gray laughed.

“The other day when an old girl came in and wanted to invest a thousand dollars in a wildcat scheme that her minister had recommended he refused to take the order, and when she insisted he gave her such hell that she went out sobbing. And then he called up the minister and gave him hell too.”

“People say a lot of hard things about us brokers, but there are brokers and brokers. I don't want people to lose money, I want them to make it, and the way they act, most of them, you'd think their one object in life was to get rid of every cent they have.”

“Well, what did you think of him?”Elliott asked me as we walked away after the Maturins had left us to go back to the office.

“I'm always glad to meet new types. I thought the mutual affection of father and son was rather touching.I don't know that that's so common in England.”

“He adores that boy. He's a queer mixture.What he said about his clients was quite true.He's got hundreds of old women, retired service men, and ministers whose savings he looks after.I'd have thought they were more trouble than they're worth, but he takes pride in the confidence they have in him.But when he's got some big deal on and he’s up against powerful interests there isn’t a man who can be harder and more ruthless.There’s no mercy in him then.He wants his pound of flesh and there’s nothing much he’ll stop at to get it.Get on the wrong side of him and he’ll not only ruin you, but get a big laugh out of doing it.”

On getting home Elliott told Mrs. Bradley that Larry had refused Henry Maturin's offer.Isabel had been lunching with girl friends and came in while they were still talking about it.They told her.I gathered from Elliott's account of the conversation that ensued that he had expressed himself with considerable eloquence.Though he had certainly not done a stroke of work for ten years, and the work by which he had amassed an ample competence had been far from arduous, he was firmly of opinion that for the run of mankind industry was essential.Larry was a perfectly ordinary young fellow, of no social consequence, and there was no possible reason why he shouldn't conform to the commendable customs of his country.It was evident to a man as clear-sighted as Elliott that America was entering upon a period of prosperity such as it had never known.Larry had a chance of getting in on the ground floor, and if he kept his nose to the grindstone he might well be many times a millionaire by the time he was forty.If he wanted to retire then and live like a gentleman, in Paris, say, with an apartment in the Avenue du Bois and a château in Touraine, he（Elliott）would have nothing to say against it.But Louisa Bradley was more succinct and more unanswerable.

“If he loves you, he ought to be prepared to work for you.”

I don't know what Isabel answered to all this, but she was sensible enough to see that her elders had reason on their side. All the young men of her acquaintance were studying to enter some profession or already busy in an office.Larry could hardly expect to live the rest of his life on his distinguished record in the air corps.The war was over, everyone was sick of it and anxious only to forget about it as quickly as possible.The result of the discussion was that Isabel agreed to have the matter out with Larry once and for all.Mrs.Bradley suggested that Isabel should ask him to drive her down to Marvin.She was ordering new curtains for the living-room and had mislaid the measurements, so she wanted Isabel to take them again.

“Bob Nelson will give you luncheon，”she said.

“I have a better plan than that，”said Elliott.“Put up a luncheon basket for them and let them lunch on the stoop and after lunch they can talk.”

“That would be fun，”said Isabel.

“There are few things so pleasant as a picnic eaten in perfect comfort，”Elliott added sententiously.“The old Duchesse d'Uzès used to tell me that the most recalcitrant male becomes amenable to suggestion in these conditions.What will you give them for luncheon?”

“Stuffed eggs and a chicken sandwich.”

“Nonsense. You can't have a picnic without pâté de foie gras.You must give them curried shrimps to start with, breast of chicken in aspic, with a heart-of-lettuce salad for which I’ll make the dressing myself, and after the pâté if you like, as a concession to your American habits, an apple pie.”

“I shall give them stuffed eggs and a chicken sandwich, Elliott，”said Mrs. Bradley with decision.

“Well, mark my words, it'll be a failure and you'll only have yourself to blame.”

“Larry eats very little, Uncle Elliott，”said Isabel，“and I don't believe he notices what he eats.”

“I hope you don't think that is to his credit, my poor child，”her uncle returned.

But what Mrs. Bradley said they should have was what they got.When Elliott later told me the outcome of the excursion he shrugged his shoulders in a very French way.

“I told them it would be a failure. I begged Louisa to put in a bottle of the Montrachet I sent her just before the war, but she wouldn't listen to me.They took a thermos of hot coffee and nothing else.What would you expect?”

It appeared that Louisa Bradley and Elliott were sitting by themselves in the living-room when they heard the car stop at the door and Isabel came into the house. It was just after dark and the curtains were drawn.Elliott was lounging in an armchair by the fireside reading a novel and Mrs.Bradley was at work on a piece of tapestry that was to be made into a firescreen.Isabel did not come in, but went on up to her room.

Elliott looked over his spectacles at his sister.

“I expect she's gone to take off her hat. She'll be down in a minute，”she said.

But Isabel did not come. Several minutes passed.

“Perhaps she's tired. She may be lying down.”

“Wouldn't you have expected Larry to have come in?”

“Don't be exasperating, Elliott.”

“Well, it's your business, not mine.”

He returned to his book. Mrs.Bradley went on working.But when half an hour had gone by she got up suddenly.

“I think perhaps I'd better go up and see that she's all right. If she's resting I won't disturb her.”

She left the room, but in a very short while came down again.

“She's been crying. Larry's going to Paris.He's going to be away for two years.She's promised to wait for him.”

“Why does he want to go to Paris?”

“It's no good asking me questions, Elliott. I don't know.She won't tell me anything.She says she understands and she isn't going to stand in his way.I said to her，‘If he's prepared to leave you for two years he can’t love you verymuch.’‘I can’t help that，’she said，‘the thing that matters is that I love him very much.’‘Even after what’s happened today?’I said.‘Today’s made me love him more than ever I did，’she said，‘and he does love me, Mamma.I’m sure of that.’”

Elliott reflected for a while.

“And what's to happen at the end of two years?”

“I tell you I don't know, Elliott.”

“Don't you think it's very unsatisfactory?”

“Very.”

“There's only one thing to be said and that is that they're both very young. It won't hurt them to wait two years and in that time a lot may happen.”

They agreed that it would be better to leave Isabel in peace. They were going out to dinner that night.

“I don't want to upset her，”said Mrs. Bradley.“People would only wonder if her eyes were all swollen.”

But next day after luncheon, which they had by themselves, Mrs. Bradley brought the subject up again.But she got little out of Isabel.

“There's really nothing more to tell you than I've told you already, Mamma，”she said.

“But what does he want to do in Paris?”

Isabel smiled, for she knew how preposterous her answer would seem to her mother.

“Loaf.”

“Loaf?What on earth do you mean?”

“That's what he told me.”

“Really I have no patience with you. If you had any spirit you'd have broken off your engagement there and then.He's just playing with you.”

Isabel looked at the ring she wore on her left hand.

“What can I do?I love him.”

Then Elliott entered the conversation. He approached the matter with his famous tact，“Not as if I was her uncle, my dear fellow, but as a man of the world speaking to an inexperienced girl，”but he did no better than her mother had done.I received the impression that she had told him, no doubt politely but quite unmistakably, to mind his own business.Elliott told me all this later on in the day in the little sitting-room I had at the Blackstone.

“Of course Louisa is quite right，”he added.“It's all very unsatisfactory, but that's the sort of thing you run up against when young people are left to arrange their marriages on no better basis than mutual inclination. I've told Louisa not to worry；I think it'll turn out better than she expects.With Larry out of the way and young Gray Maturin on the spot-well, if I know anything about my fellow-creatures the outcome is fairly obvious.When you're eighteen your emotions are violent, but they’re not durable.”

“You're full of worldly wisdom, Elliott，”I smiled.

“I haven't read my La Rochefoucauld for nothing. You know what Chicago is；they'll be meeting all the time.It flatters a girl to have a man so devoted to her, and when she knows there isn't one of her girl friends who wouldn't be only too glad to marry him-well, I ask you, is it in human nature to resist the temptation of cutting out everyone else?I mean it's like going to a party where you know you’ll be bored to distraction and the only refreshments will be lemonade and biscuits；but you go because you know your best friends would give their eye-teeth to and haven’t been asked.”

“When does Larry go?”

“I don't know. I don't think that's been decided yet.”Elliott took a long, thin cigarette case in platinum and gold out of his pocket and extracted an Egyptian cigarette.Not for him were Fatimas, Chesterfields, Camels, or Lucky Strikes.He looked at me with a smile full of insinuation.“Of course I wouldn't care to say so to Louisa, but I don't mind telling you that I have a sneaking sympathy for the young fellow.I understand that he got a glimpse of Parisduring the war, and I can’t blame him if he was captivated by the only city in the world fit for a civilized man to live in.He’s young and I have no doubt he wants to sow his wild oats before he settles down to married life.Very natural and very proper.I’ll keep an eye on him.I’ll introduce him to the right people；he has nice manners and with a hint or two from me he’ll be quite presentable；I can guarantee to show him a side of French life that very few Americans have a chance of seeing.Believe me, my dear fellow, the average American can get into the kingdom of heaven much more easily than he can get into the Boulevard St.Germain.He’s twenty and he has charm.I think I could probably arrange a liaison for him with an older woman.It would form him.I always think there’s no better education for a young man than to become the lover of a woman of a certain age and of course if she is the sort of person I have in view, a femme du monde, you know, it would immediately give him a situation in Paris.”

“Did you tell that to Mrs. Bradley?”I asked, smiling.

Elliott chuckled.

“My dear fellow, if there's one thing I pride myself on it's my tact. I did not tell her.She wouldn't understand, poor dear.It's one of the things I've never understood about Louisa；though she’s lived half her life in diplomatic society, in half the capitals of the world, she’s remained hopelessly American.”

That evening I went to dine at a great stone house on Lake Shore Drive which looked as though the architect had started to build a medieval castle and then, changing his mind in the middle, had decided to turn it into a Swiss chalet. It was a huge party and I was glad when I got into the vast and sumptuous drawing-room, all statues, palms, chandeliers, old masters, and overstuffed furniture, to see that there were at least a few people I knew.I was introduced by Henry Maturin to his thin, raddled, frail wife.I said how d'you do to Mrs.Bradley and Isabel.Isabel was looking very pretty in a red silk dress that suited her dark hair and rich hazel eyes.She appeared to be in high spirits and no one could have guessed that she had so recently gone through a harassing experience.She was talking gaily to the two or three young men, Gray among them, who surrounded her.She sat at dinner at another table and I could not see her, but afterwards, when we men, after lingering interminably over our coffee, liqueurs, and cigars, returned to the drawing-room, I had a chance to speak to her.I knew her too little to say anything directly about what Elliott had told me, but I had something to say that I thought she might be glad to hear.

“I saw your young man the other day in the club，”I remarked casually.

“Oh, did you?”

She spoke as casually as I had, but I perceived that she was instantly alert. Her eyes grew watchful and I thought I read in them something like apprehension.

“He was reading in the library. I was very much impressed by his power of concentration.He was reading when I went in soon after ten, he was still reading when I went back after lunch, and he was reading when I went in again on my way out to dinner.I don't believe he'd moved from his chair for the best part of ten hours.”

“What was he reading?”

“William James's Principles of Psychology.”

She looked down so that I had no means of knowing how what I had said affected her, but I had a notion that she was at once puzzled and relieved. I was at that moment fetched by my host who wanted me to play bridge and by the time the game broke up Isabel and her mother had gone.

10

A couple of days later I went to say good-bye to Mrs. Bradley and Elliott.I found them sitting over a cup of tea.Isabel came in shortly after me.We talked about my approaching journey, I thanked them for their kindness to meduring my stay in Chicago and after a decent interval got up to go.

“I'll walk with you as far as the drugstore，”said Isabel.“I've just remembered there's something I want to get.”

The last words Mrs. Bradley said to me were，“You will give my love to dear Queen Margherita the next time you see her, won't you?”

I had given up disclaiming any acquaintance with that august lady and answered glibly that I would be sure to.

When we got into the street Isabel gave me a sidelong smiling glance.

“D'you think you could drink an ice-cream soda?”she asked me.

“I could try，”I answered prudently.

Isabel did not speak till we reached the drugstore, and I, having nothing to say, said nothing. We went in and sat at a table on chairs with twisted wire backs and twisted wire legs.They were very uncomfortable.I ordered two ice-cream sodas.There were a few people at the counters buying；two or three couples were seated at other tables, but they were busy with their own concerns；and to all intents and purposes we were alone.I lit a cigarette and waited while Isabel with every appearance of satisfaction sucked at a long straw.I had a notion that she was nervous.

“I wanted to talk to you，”she said abruptly.

“I gathered that，”I smiled.

For a moment or two she looked at me reflectively.

“Why did you say that about Larry at the Satterthwaites'the night before last?”

“I thought it would interest you. It occurred to me that perhaps you didn't quite know what his idea of loafing was.”

“Uncle Elliott's a terrible gossip. When he said he was going to the Blackstone to have a chat with you I knew he was going to tell you all about everything.”

“I've known him a good many years, you know. He gets a lot of fun out of talking about other people's business.”

“He does，”she smiled. But it was only a gleam.She looked at me steadily and her eyes were serious.“What do you think of Larry?”

“I've only seen him three times. He seems a very nice boy.”

“Is that all?”

There was a note of distress in her voice.

“No, not quite. It's hard for me to say；you see, I know him so little.Of course, he's attractive.There's something modest and friendly and gentle in him that is very appealing.He's got a lot of self-possession for so young a man.He isn't quite like any of the other boys I’ve met here.”

While I was thus fumblingly trying to put into words an impression that was not distinct in my own mind, Isabel looked at me intently. When I had finished she gave a little sigh, as if of relief, and then flashed a charming, almost roguish smile at me.

“Uncle Elliott says he's often been surprised at your power of observation. He says nothing much escapes you, but that your great asset as a writer is your common sense.”

“I can think of a quality that would be more valuable，”I answered dryly.“Talent, for instance.”

“You know, I have no one to talk this over with. Mamma can only see things from her own point of view.She wants my future to be assured.”

“That's natural, isn't it?”

“And Uncle Elliott only looks at it from the social side. My own friends, those of my generation, I mean, think Larry's a washout.It hurts terribly.”

“Of course.”

“It's not that they're not nice to him. One can't help being nice to Larry.But they look upon him as a joke.They josh him a lot and it exasperates them that he doesn't seem to care.He only laughs.You know how things are at present?”

“I only know what Elliott has told me.”

“May I tell you exactly what happened when we went down to Marvin?”

“Of course.”

I have reconstructed Isabel's account partly from my recollection of what she then said to me and partly with the help of my imagination. But it was a long talk that she and Larry had, and I have no doubt that they said a great deal more than I now propose to relate.I suspect that as people do on these occasions they not only said much that was irrelevant, but said the same things over and over again.

When Isabel awoke and saw that it was a fine day she gave Larry a ring and, telling him that her mother wanted her to go to Marvin to do something for her, asked him to drive her down. She took the precaution to add a thermos of martinis to the thermos of coffee her mother had told Eugene to put in the basket.Larry's roadster was a recent acquisition and he was proud of it.He was a fast driver and the speed at which he went exhilarated them both.When they arrived, Isabel, with Larry to write down the figures, measured the curtains that were to be replaced.Then they set out the luncheon on the stoop.It was sheltered from any wind there was and the sun of the Indian summer was good to bask in.The house, on a dirt road, had none of the elegance of the old frame houses of New England, and the best you could say of it was that it was roomy and comfortable, but from the stoop you had a pleasing view of a great red barn with a black roof, a clump of old trees, and beyond them, as far as the eye could reach, brown fields.It was a dull landscape, but the sunshine and the glowing tints of the waning year gave it that day an intimate loveliness.There was an exhilaration in the great space that was spread before you.Cold, bleak, and dreary as it must have been in winter, dry, sunbaked, and oppressive as it may have been in the dog days, just then it was strangely exciting, for the vastness of the view invited the soul to adventure.

They enjoyed their lunch like the healthy young things they were and they were happy to be together. Isabel poured out the coffee and Larry lit his pipe.

“Now go right ahead, darling，”he said, with an amused smile in his eyes.

Isabel was taken aback.

“Go right ahead about what?”she asked with as innocent a look as she could assume.

He chuckled.

“Do you take me for a perfect fool, honey?If your mother didn't know perfectly well the measurements of the living-room windows I'll eat my hat. That isn't why you asked me to drive you down here.”

Recovering her self-assurance, she gave him a brilliant smile.

“It might be that I thought it would be nice if we spent a day together by ourselves.”

“It might be, but I don't think, it is. My guess is that Uncle Elliott has told you that I've turned down Henry Maturin's offer.”

He spoke gaily and lightly and she found it convenient to continue in the same tone.

“Gray must be terribly disappointed. He thought it would be grand to have you in the office.You must get down to work some time, and the longer you leave it the harder it'll be.”

He puffed at his pipe and looked at her, tenderly smiling, so that she could not tell if he was serious or not.

“Do you know, I've got an idea that I want to do more with my life than sell bonds.”

“All right then. Go into a law office or study medicine.”

“No, I don't want to do that either.”

“What do you want to do then?”

“Loaf，”he replied calmly.

“Oh, Larry, don't be funny. This is desperately serious.”

Her voice quivered and her eyes filled with tears.

“Don't cry, darling. I don't want to make you miserable.”

He went and sat down beside her and put his arm round her. There was a tenderness in his voice that broke her andshe could no longer hold back her tears.But she dried her eyes and forced a smile to her lips.

“It's all very fine to say you don't want to make me miserable. You are making me miserable.You see, I love you.”

“I love you too, Isabel.”

She sighed deeply. Then she disengaged herself from his arm and drew away from him.

“Let's be sensible. A man must work, Larry.It's a matter of self-respect.This is a young country, and it's a man's duty to take part in its activities.Henry Maturin was saying only the other day that we were beginning an era that would make the achievements of the past look like two bits.He said he could see no limit to our progress and he's convinced that by 1930 we shall be the richest and greatest country in the world.Don’t you think that’s terribly exciting?”

“Terribly.”

“There's never been such a chance for a young man. I should have thought you'd be proud to take part in the work that lies before us.It's such a wonderful adventure.”

He laughed lightly.

“I dare say you're right. The Armours and the Swifts will pack more and better meat, the McCormicks will make more and better harvesters, and Henry Ford will turn out more and better cars.And everyone'll get richer and richer.”

“And why not?”

“As you say, and why not?Money just doesn't happen to interest me.”

Isabel giggled.

“Darling, don't talk like a fool. One can't live without money.”

“I have a little. That's what gives me the chance to do what I want.”

“Loaf?”

“Yes，”he answered, smiling.

“You're making it so difficult for me, Larry，”she sighed.

“I'm sorry. I wouldn't if I could help it.”

“You can help it.”

He shook his head. He was silent for a while, lost in thought.When at last he spoke it was to say something that startled her.

“The dead look so terribly dead when they're dead.”

“What do you mean exactly?”she asked, troubled.

“Just that.”He gave her a rueful smile.“You have a lot of time to think when you're up in the air by yourself. You get odd ideas.”

“What sort of ideas?”

“Vague，”he said, smiling.“Incoherent. Confused.”

Isabel thought this over for a while.

“Don't you think if you took a job they might sort themselves out and you'd know where you were?”“I've thought of that. I had a notion that I might go to work with a carpenter or in a garage.”

“Oh, Larry, people would think you were crazy.”

“Would that matter?”

“To me, yes.”

Once more silence fell upon them. It was she who broke it.She sighed.

“You're so different from what you were before you went out to France.”

“That's not strange. A lot happened to me then, you know.”

“Such as?”

“Oh, just the ordinary casual run of events. My greatest friend in the air corps was killed saving my life.I didn't find that easy to get over.”

“Tell me, Larry.”

He looked at her with deep distress in his eyes.

“I'd rather not talk about it. After all, it was only a trivial incident.”

Emotional by nature, Isabel's eyes again filled with tears.

“Are you unhappy, darling?”

“No，”he answered, smiling.“The only thing that makes me unhappy is that I'm making you unhappy.”He took her hand and there was something so friendly in the feel of his strong firm hand against hers, something so intimately affectionate, that she had to bite her lips to prevent herself from crying.“I don't think I shall ever find peace till I make up my mind about things，”he said gravely. He hesitated.“It's very difficult to put into words.The moment you try to you feel embarrassed.You say to yourself：‘Who am I that I should bother my head about this, that, and the other?Perhaps it's only because I'm a conceited prig.Wouldn’t it be better to follow the beaten track and let what’s coming to you come?’And then you think of a fellow who an hour before was full of life and fun, and he’s lying dead；it’s all so cruel and so meaningless.It’s hard not to ask yourself what life is all about and whether there’s any sense to it or whether it’s all a tragic blunder of blind fate.”

It was impossible not to be moved when Larry, with that wonderfully melodious voice of his, spoke, haltingly as though he forced himself to say what he would sooner have left unsaid and yet with such an anguished sincerity；and for a while Isabel did not trust herself to speak.

“Would it help you if you went away for a bit?”

She put the question with a sinking heart. He took a long time to answer.

“I think so. You try to be indifferent to public opinion, but it's not easy.When it's antagonistic it arouses antagonism in you and that disturbs you.”

“Why don't you go then?”

“Well, on account of you.”

“Let's be frank with one another, darling. There's no place for me in your life just now.”

“Does that mean you don't want to be engaged to me any more?”

She forced a smile to her trembling lips.

“No, foolish, it means I'm prepared to wait.”

“It may be a year. It may be two.”

“That's all right. It may be less.Where'd you want to go?”

He looked at her intently as though he were trying to see into her innermost heart. She smiled lightly to hide her deep distress.

“Well, I thought I'd start by going to Paris. I know no one there.There'd be no one to interfere with me.I went to Paris several times on leave.I don't know why, but I've got it into my head that there everything that's muddled in my mind would grow clear.It’s a funny picture, it gives you the feeling that there you can think out your thoughts to the end without let or hindrance.I think there I may be able to see my way before me.”

“And what's to happen if you don't?”

He chuckled.

“Then I shall fall back on my good American horse sense, give it up as a bad job and come back to Chicago and take any work I can get.”

The scene had affected Isabel too much for her to be able to tell it to me without getting somewhat emotional, and when she finished she looked at me pitifully.

“Do you think I did right?”

“I think you did the only thing you could do, but what's more I think you've been wonderfully kind, generous, and understanding.”

“I love him and I want him to be happy. And you know, in a way I'm not sorry he should go.I want him to be out of this hostile atmosphere, and that not only for his sake, but for mine too.I can't blame people when they say he'll never amount to anything；I hate them for it, and yet all the time deep down in me I have an awful fear that they're right.But don't say I’m understanding.I don’t begin to understand what he’s after.”

“Perhaps you understand with your heart rather than with your reason，”I smiled.“Why don't you marry him right away and go off to Paris with him?'

The shadow of a smile came into her eyes.

“There's nothing I'd like to do more. But I couldn't.And you know, though I hate to acknowledge it, I do really think he's better off without me.If Dr.Nelson is right and he's suffering from delayed shock surely new surroundings and new interests will cure him, and when he’s got his balance again he’ll come back to Chicago and go into business like everybody else.I wouldn’t want to marry an idler.”

Isabel had been brought up in a certain way and she accepted the principles that had been instilled into her. She did not think of money, because she had never known what it was not to have all she needed, but she was instinctively aware of its importance.It meant power, influence, and social consequence.It was the natural and obvious thing that a man should earn it.That was his plain life's work.

“It doesn't surprise me that you don't understand Larry，”I said，“because I'm pretty sure he doesn't understand himself. If he's reticent about his aims it may be that it’s because they’re obscure to him.Mind you, I hardly know him and this is only guesswork：isn’t it possible that he’s looking for something, but what it is he doesn’t know, and perhaps he isn’t even sure it’s there?Perhaps whatever it is that happened to him during the war has left him with a restlessness that won’t let him be.Don’t you think he may be pursuing an ideal that is hidden in a cloud of unknowing-like an astronomer looking for a star that only a mathematical calculation tells him exists?”

“I feel that something's troubling him.”

“His soul?It may be that he's a little frightened of himself. It may be that he has no confidence in the authenticity of the vision that he dimly perceives in his mind's eye.”

“He gives me such an odd impression sometimes；he gives me the impression of a sleep-walker who's suddenly wakened in a strange place and can't think where he is. He was so normal before the war.One of the nice things about him was his enormous zest for life.He was so scatter-brained and gay, it was wonderful to be with him；he was so sweet and ridiculous.What can have happened to change him so much?”

“I wouldn't know. Sometimes a very small thing will have an effect on you out of all proportion to the event.It depends on the circumstances and your mood at the time.I remember going to mass on All Saints'Day, which the French called the Day of the Dead, in a village church that the Germans had knocked about a bit on their first advance into France.It was filled with soldiers and with women in black.In the graveyard were rows of little wooden crosses and as the sad, solemn service went on, and women wept and men too, I had a feeling that perhaps those men who lay under the little crosses were better off than we who lived.I told a friend what I felt and he asked me what I meant.I couldn't explain and I saw that he thought me a perfect damned fool.And I remember after a battle seeing a pile of dead French soldiers heaped upon one another.They looked like the marionettes in a bankrupt puppet show that had been cast pell-mell into a dusty corner because they were of no use any more.I thought then just what Larry said to you：the dead look so awfully dead.”

I do not want the reader to think I am making a mystery of whatever it was that happened to Larry during the war that so profoundly affected him, a mystery that I shall disclose at a convenient moment. I don't think he ever told anybody.He did, however, many years later tell a woman, Suzanne Rouvier, whom Larry and I both knew, about the young airman who had met his death saving his life.She repeated it to me and so I can only relate it at second hand.I have translated it from her French.Larry had apparently struck up a great friendship with another boy in his squadron.Suzanne knew him only by the ironical nickname by which Larry spoke of him.

“He was a little chap with red hair, an Irishman. We used to call him Patsy，”Larry said，“and he had more vitalitythan anyone I've ever known.Gosh, he was a live wire.He had a funny face and a funny grin, so that it made you laugh just to look at him.He was a harum-scarum devil and he'd do the craziest things；he was always getting hell from the higher-ups.He was absolutely without fear and when he'd escaped death by a hair's breadth he'd grin all over his face as if it was the best joke in the world.But he was a natural-born flyer and up in the air he was cool and wary.He taught me a lot.He was a bit older than me and he took me under his wing；it was rather comic really, because I was a good six inches taller than he was and if it had come to a scrap I could have knocked him out cold.Once in Paris when he was drunk and I was afraid he was going to get into trouble I did.

“I felt a bit out of it when I joined the squadron and I was afraid I wouldn't make good, but he just joshed me into having confidence in myself. He was funny about the war, he had no feeling of hatred for the Jerries；he loved a scrap and to fight them tickled him to death.He simply couldn't look upon bringing down one of their planes as anything but a practical joke.He was impudent and wild and irresponsible, but there was something so genuine about him that you couldn't help liking him.He'd give you his last penny as freely as he'd take yours.And if you were lonely or homesick or scared, and I was sometimes, he’d see it and with his ugly little face puckered up with laughter he’d say just the right thing to make you feel all right again.”

Larry puffed at his pipe and Suzanne waited for him to go on.

“We used to wangle it so that we could get our leave together, and when we were in Paris he went wild. We had a grand time.We were due for a spot of leave early in March, in'eighteen that was, and we made our plans beforehand.There wasn't a thing we weren't going to do.The day before we were to go we were sent up to fly over the enemy lines and bring back reports of what we saw.Suddenly we came bang up against some German planes, and before we knew where we were we were in the middle of a dogfight.One of them came after me, but I got in first.I took a look to see if he was going to crash and then out of the corner of my eye I saw another plane on my tail.I dived to get away from him, but he was on to me like a flash and I thought I was done for；then I saw Patsy come down on him like a streak of lightning and give him all he'd got.They'd had enough and sheered off and we made for home.My machine had got pretty well knocked about and I only just made it.Patsy got in before me.When I got out of my plane they’d just got him out of his.He was lying on the ground and they were waiting for the ambulance to come up.When he saw me he grinned.

“‘I got that blighter who was on your tail，'he said.

“‘What's the matter, Patsy?'I asked.

“‘Oh, it's nothing. He winged me.'

“He was looking deathly white. Suddenly a strange look came over his face.It had just come to him that he was dying, and the possibility of death had never so much as crossed his mind.Before they could stop him he sat up and gave a laugh.

“‘Well, I'm jiggered，'he said.

“He fell back dead. He was twenty-two.He was going to marry a girl in Ireland after the war.”

The day after my talk with Isabel I left Chicago for San Francisco, where I was to take ship for the Far East.





CHAPTER TWO


1


I did not see Elliott till he came to London towards the end of June in the following year. I asked him whether Larry had after all gone to Paris.He had.I was faintly amused at Elliott's exasperation with him.

“I had a kind of sneaking sympathy for the boy. I couldn't blame him for wanting to spend a couple of years in Paris and I was prepared to launch him.I told him to let me know the moment he arrived, but it was only when Louisa wrote and told me he was there that I knew he'd come.I wrote to him care of the American Express, which was the address she gave me, and asked him to come and dine to meet some of the people I thought he ought to know；I thought I'd try him out first with the Franco-American set, Emily de Montadour and Gracie de Château-Gaillard and so on, and d’you know what he answered?He said he was sorry he couldn’t come, but he hadn’t brought any evening clothes with him，”

Elliott looked me full in the face to see the stupefaction with which he expected this communication to fill me. He raised a supercilious eyebrow when he observed that I took it with calm.

“He replied to my letter on a sheet of nasty paper with the heading of a café in the Latin Quarter and when I wrote back I asked him to let me know where he was staying.I felt I must do something about him for Isabel’s sake, and I thought perhaps he was shy-I mean I couldn’t believe that any young fellow in his senses could come to Paris without evening clothes, and in any case there are tolerable tailors there, so I asked him to lunch and said it would be quite a small party, and would you believe it, not only did he ignore my request to give me some other address than the American Express, but he said he never ate luncheon.That finished him as far as I was concerned.”

“I wonder what he's been doing with himself.”

“I don't know, and to tell you the truth I don't care. I'm afraid he's a thoroughly undesirable young man and I think it would be a great mistake for Isabel to marry him.After all, if he led a normal sort of life I'd have run across him at the Ritz bar or at Fouquet’s or somewhere.”

I go sometimes to these fashionable places myself, but I go to others also, and it happened that I spent several days in Paris early in the autumn of that year on my way to Marseilles, where I was proposing to take one of the Messagerie ships for Singapore. I dined one evening with friends in Montparnasse and after dinner we went to the Dôme to drink a glass of beer.Presently my wandering eye caught sight of Larry sitting by himself at a little marble-topped table on the crowded terrace.He was looking idly at the people who strolled up and down enjoying the coolness of the night after a sultry day.I left my party and went up to him.His face lit up when he saw me and he gave me an engaging smile.He asked me to sit down, but I said I couldn’t as I was with a party.

“I just wanted to say how d'you do to you，”I said.

“Are you staying here?”he asked.

“Only for a very few days.”

“Will you lunch with me tomorrow?”

“I thought you never lunched.”

He chuckled.

“You've seen Elliott. I don't generally.I can't afford the time, I just have a glass of milk and a brioche, but I'd like you to lunch with me.”

“All right.”

We arranged to meet at the Dôme next day to have an apéritif and eat at some place on the boulevard.I rejoined my friends.We sat on talking.When next I looked for Larry he had gone.

I spent the next morning very pleasantly. I went to the Luxembourg and passed an hour looking at some pictures I liked.Then I strolled in the gardens, recapturing the memories of my youth.Nothing had changed.They might have been the same students who walked along the gravel paths in pairs, eagerly discussing the writers who excited them.They might have been the same children who trundled the same hoops under the watchful eyes of the same nurses.They might have been the same old men who basked in the sunshine, reading the morning paper.They might have been the same middle-aged women in mourning who sat on the free benches and gossiped with one another about the price of food and the misdeeds of servants.Then I went to the Odéon and looked at the new books in the galleries and I saw the lads who like myself thirty years before were trying under the petulant eyes of the smock-frocked attendants to read as much as they could of books they could not afford to buy.Then I strolled leisurely along those dear, dingy streets till I came to the Boulevard du Montparnasse and so to the Dôme.Larry was waiting.We had a drink and walked along to a restaurant where we could lunch in the open air.

He was perhaps a little paler than I remembered him and this made his very dark eyes, in their deep orbits, more striking；but he had the same self-possession, curious in one so young, and the same ingenuous smile. When he ordered his lunch I noticed that he spoke French fluently and with a good accent.I congratulated him on it.

“I knew a certain amount of French before, you know，”he explained.“Aunt Louisa had a French governess for Isabel, and when they were at Marvin she used to make us talk French with her all the time.”

I asked him how he liked Paris.

“Very much.”

“D'you live in Montparnasse?”

“Yes，”he said, after a moment's hesitation which I interpreted into a disinclination to tell exactly where he lived.

“Elliott was rather put out that the only address you gave was the American Express.”

Larry smiled but did not answer.

“What do you do with yourself all the time?”

“I loaf.”

“And you read?”

“Yes, I read.”

“Do you ever hear from Isabel?”

“Sometimes. We're neither of us great letter-writers.She's having a grand time in Chicago.They're coming over next year to stay with Elliott.”

“That'll be nice for you.”

“I don't believe Isabel's ever been to Paris. It'll be fun taking her around.”

He was curious to know about my journey in China and listened attentively to what I told him；but when I tried to get him to talk about himself, I failed. He was so uncommunicative that I was forced to the conclusion that he had asked me to lunch with him merely to enjoy my company.I was pleased, but baffled.We had no sooner finished our coffee than he called for the bill, paid it, and got up.

“Well, I must be off，”he said.

We parted. I knew no more of what he was up to than before.I did not see him again.

I was not in Paris in the spring when, sooner than they had planned, Mrs. Bradley and Isabel arrived to stay with Elliott；and again I have to eke out my knowledge or what passed during the few weeks they spent there by the exercise of my imagination.They landed at Cherbourg, and Elliott, always considerate, went to meet them.They passed through the customs.The train started.Elliott with some complacency told them that he had engaged a very good lady's maid to look after them and when Mrs.Bradley said that was quite unnecessary, since they didn't need one, he was very sharp with her.

“Don't be tiresome the moment you arrive, Louisa. No one can be well turned out without a maid, and I've engaged Antoinette not only for your sake and Isabel's but for mine.It would mortify me that you shouldn't beperfectly dressed.”

He gave the clothes they were wearing a disparaging glance.

“Of course you'll want to buy some new frocks. On mature consideration I've come to the conclusion that you can't do better than Chanel.”

“I always used to go to Worth，”said Mrs. Bradley.

She might as well not have spoken, for he took no notice.

“I've talked to Chanel myself and I've made an appointment for you tomorrow at three. Then there are hats.Obviously Reboux.”

“I don't want to spend a lot of money, Elliott.”

“I know. I am proposing to pay for everything myself.I'm determined that you shall be a credit to me.Oh, and Louisa, I've arranged several parties for you and I've told my French friends that Myron was an ambassador, which, of course, he would have been if he'd lived a little longer, and it makes a better effect.I don't suppose it’ll come up, but I thought I’d better warn you.”

“You're ridiculous, Elliott.”

“No, I'm not. I know the world.I know that the widow of an ambassador has more prestige than the widow of a minister.”

As the train steamed into the Gare du Nord, Isabel, who was standing at the window, called out：

“There's Larry.”

It had hardly stopped when she sprang out and ran to meet him. He threw his arms around her.

“How did he know you were coming?”Elliott asked his sister acidly.

“Isabel wirelessed him from the ship.”

Mrs. Bradley kissed him affectionately, and Elliott gave him a limp hand to shake.It was ten o'clock at night.

“Uncle Elliott, can Larry come to lunch tomorrow?”cried Isabel, her arm in the young man's, her face eager and her eyes shining.

“I should be charmed, but Larry has given me to understand that he doesn't eat lunch.”

“He will tomorrow, won't you, Larry?”

“I will，”he smiled.

“I shall look forward to seeing you at one o'clock then.”

He stretched out his hand once more, intending to dismiss him, but Larry grinned at him impudently.

“I'll help with the luggage and get a cab for you.”

“My car is waiting and my man will see to the luggage，”said Elliott with dignity.

“That's fine. Then all we've got to do is to go.If there's room for me I'll come as far as your door with you.”

“Yes, do, Larry，”said Isabel.

They walked down the platform together, followed by Mrs. Bradley and Elliott.Elliott's face bore a look of frigid disapproval.

“Quelles manières，”he said to himself, for in certain circumstances he felt he could express his sentiments more forcibly in French.

Next morning at eleven, having finished dressing, for he was not an early riser, he sent a note to his sister, via his man Joseph and her maid Antoinette, to ask her to come to the library so that they could have a talk. When she appeared he closed the door carefully and, putting a cigarette into an immensely long agate holder, lit it and sat down.

“Am I to understand that Isabel and Larry are still engaged?”he asked.

“So far as I know.”

“I'm afraid I haven't a very good account to give you of the young man.”He told her then how he had been prepared to launch him in society and the plans he had made to establish him in a fit and proper manner.“I even had my eye on a rez-de-chaussée that would have been the very thing for him.It belongs to the young Marquis de Rethel and hewanted to sublet it because he’d been appointed to the embassy at Madrid.”

But Larry had refused his invitations in a manner that made it quite clear that he did not want his help.

“What the object of coming to Paris is if you're not going to take advantage of what Paris has to give you is beyond my comprehension. I don't know what he does with himself.He doesn't seem to know anybody.Do you know where he lives?”

“The only address we've ever had is the American Express.”

“Like a travelling salesman or a school-teacher on vacation. I shouldn't be surprised if he was living with some little trollop in a studio in Montmartre.”

“Oh, Elliott.”

“What other explanation can there be for the mystery he's making of his dwelling place and for his refusal to consort with people of his own class?”

“It doesn't sound like Larry. And last night, didn't you get the impression that he was just as much in love with Isabel as ever?He couldn't be so false.”

Elliott by a shrug of the shoulders gave her to understand that there was no limit to the duplicity of men.

“What about Gray Maturin?Is he still in the picture?”

“He'd marry Isabel tomorrow if she'd have him.”

Mrs. Bradley told him then why they had come to Europe sooner than they had at first intended.She had found herself in ill-health, and the doctors had informed her that she was suffering from diabetes.It was not serious, and by attention to her diet and taking moderate doses of insulin there was no reason why she should not live for a good many years, but the knowledge that she had an incurable disease made her anxious to see Isabel settled.They had talked the matter over.Isabel was sensible.She had agreed that if Larry refused to come back to Chicago at the end of the two years in Paris they had agreed upon and get a job, there was only one thing to do and that was to break with him.But it offended Mrs.Bradley's sense of personal dignity that they should wait till the appointed time and then come to fetch him, like a fugitive from justice, back to his own country.She felt that Isabel would put herself in a humiliating position.But it was very natural that they should spend the summer in Europe, where Isabel had not been since she was a child.After their visit in Paris they could go to some watering-place suitable to Mrs.Bradley's complaint, then on to the Austrian Tyrol for a while and from there travel slowly through Italy.Mrs.Bradley's intention was to ask Larry to accompany them, so that he and Isabel could see whether the long separation had left their feelings unchanged.It would be manifest in due course whether Larry, having had his fling, was prepared to accept the responsibilities of life.

“Henry Maturin was sore with him for turning down the position he offered him, but Gray has talked him round, and he can go into the business the moment he comes back to Chicago.”

“Gray's a very nice fellow.”

“He certainly is.”Mrs. Bradley sighed.“I know he'd make Isabel happy.”

Elliott then told her what parties he had arranged for them. He was giving a big luncheon on the following day and at the end of the week a grand dinner party.He was taking them to a reception at the Château-Gaillards and he had got cards for them to a ball that the Rothschilds were giving.

“You'll ask Larry, won't you?”

“He tells me he hasn't any evening clothes，”Elliott sniffed.

“Well, ask him all the same. After all, he is a nice boy, and it wouldn't help to give him the cold shoulder.It would only make Isabel obstinate.”

“Of course I'll ask him if you wish it.”

Larry came to lunch at the appointed time, and Elliott, whose manners were admirable, was pointedly cordial to him. It was not difficult, since Larry was so gay, in such high spirits that it would have needed a much more ill-natured man than Elliott not to be charmed with him.The conversation dealt with Chicago and their common friends there, so that there was not much for Elliott to do other than to look amiable and pretend to be interested in the concerns ofpersons whom he thought of no social consequence.He did not mind listening；indeed, he thought it rather touching to hear them tell of this young couple's engagement, that young couple's marriage, and another young couple's divorce.Who had ever heard of them?He knew that the pretty little Marquise de Clinchant had tried to poison herself because her lover, the Prince de Colombey, had left her to marry the daughter of a South American millionaire.That was something to talk about.Looking at Larry, he was obliged to admit that there was something peculiarly attractive in him；with his deep-set strangely black eyes, his high cheekbones, pale skin, and mobile mouth he reminded Elliott of a portrait by Botticelli, and it occurred to him that if he were dressed in the costume of the period he would look extravagantly romantic.He remembered his notion of getting him off with a distinguished Frenchwoman and he smiled slyly on reflecting that he was expecting at dinner on Saturday Marie Louise de Florimond, who combined irreproachable connexions with notorious immorality.She was forty, but looked ten years younger；she had the delicate beauty of her ancestress painted by Nattier which, owing to Elliott himself, now hung in one of the great American collections；and her sexual voracity was insatiable.Elliott decided to put Larry next to her.He knew she would waste no time in making her desires clear to him.He had already invited a young attaché at the British embassy whom he thought Isabel might like.Isabel was very pretty, and as he was an Englishman, and well off, it wouldn’t matter that she had no fortune.Mellowed by the excellent Montrachet with which they had started lunch and by the fine Bordeaux that followed, Elliott thought with tranquil pleasure of the possibilities that presented themselves to his mind.If things turned out as he thought they very well might, dear Louisa would have no more cause for anxiety.She had always slightly disapproved of him；poor dear, she was very provincial；but he was fond of her.It would be a satisfaction to him to arrange everything for her by help of his knowledge of the world.

To waste no time, Elliott had arranged to take his ladies to look at clothes immediately after lunch, so as they got up from table he intimated to Larry with the tact of which he was a master that he must make himself scarce, but at the same time he asked him with pressing affability to come to the two grand parties he had arranged. He need hardly have taken so much trouble, since Larry accepted both invitations with alacrity.

But Elliott's plan failed. He was relieved when Larry appeared at the dinner party in a very presentable dinner-jacket, for he had been a little nervous that he would wear the same blue suit that he had worn at lunch；and after dinner, getting Marie Louise de Florimond into a corner, he asked her how she had liked his young American friend.

“He has nice eyes and good teeth.”

“Is that all?I put him beside you because I thought he was just your cup of tea.”

She looked at him suspiciously.

“He told me he was engaged to your pretty niece.”

“Voyons, ma chère, the fact that a man belongs to another woman has never prevented you from taking him away from her if you could.”

“Is that what you want me to do?Well, I'm not going to do your dirty work for you, my poor Elliott.”

Elliott chuckled.

“The meaning of that, I presume, is that you tried your stuff and found there was nothing doing.”

“Why I like you, Elliott, is that you have the morals of a bawdy-house keeper. You don't want him to marry your niece.Why not?He is well bred and quite charming.But he's really too innocent.I don't think he had the least suspicion of what I meant.”

“You should have been more explicit, dear friend.”

“I have enough experience to know when I'm wasting my time. The fact is that he has eyes only for your little Isabel, and between you and me, she has twenty years advantage over me.And she's sweet.”

“Do you like her dress?I chose it for her myself.”

“It's pretty and it's suitable. But of course she has no chic.”

Elliott took this as a reflection on himself, and he was not prepared to let Madame de Florimond get away without a dig. He smiled genially.

“One has to have reached your ripe maturity to have your chic, dear friend，”he said.

Madame de Florimond wielded a bludgeon rather than a rapier. Her retort made Elliott's Virginian blood boil.

“But I'm sure that in your fair land of gangsters[votre beau pays d'apaches]they will hardly miss something that is so subtle and so inimitable.”

But if Madame de Florimond carped, the rest of Elliott's friends were delighted both with Isabel and with Larry. They liked her fresh prettiness, her abounding health, and her vitality；they liked his picturesque appearance, his good manners, and his quiet, ironic humour.Both had the advantage of speaking good and fluent French.Mrs.Bradley, after living so many years in diplomatic circles, spoke it correctly enough but with an unabashed American accent.Elliott entertained them lavishly.Isabel, pleased with her new clothes and her new hats, amused by all the gaiety Elliott provided, and happy to be with Larry, thought she had never enjoyed herself so much.

Elliott was of opinion that breakfast was a meal that you should share only with total strangers, and then only if there was no help for it, so Mrs. Bradley, somewhat against her will, and Isabel, far from displeased, were obliged to have theirs in their bedrooms.But Isabel, when she awoke, sometimes told Antoinette the grand maid Elliott had engaged for them, to take her café au lait into her mother’s room so that she could talk to her while she had it.In the busy life she led it was the only moment of the day in which she could be alone with her.One such morning, when they had been in Paris nearly a month, after Isabel had done narrating the events of the previous night, most of which she and Larry had spent going the rounds of the night clubs with a party of friends, Mrs.Bradley let fall the question she had had in mind to ask ever since their arrival.

“When is he coming back to Chicago?”

“I don't know. He hasn't spoken of it.”

“Haven't you asked him?”

“No.”

“Are you scared to?”

“No, of course not.”

Mrs. Bradley, lying on a chaise longue, in a modish dressing-gown that Elliott had insisted on giving her, was polishing her nails.

“What do you talk about all the time when you're alone?”

“We don't talk all the time. It's nice to be together.You know, Larry was always rather silent.When we talk I think I do most of the talking.”

“What has he been doing with himself?”

“I don't really know. I don't think anything very much.I suppose he's been having a good time.”

“And where is he living?”

“I don't know that either.”

“He seems very reticent, doesn't he?”

Isabel lit a cigarette and, as she blew a cloud of smoke from her nostrils, looked coolly at her mother.

“What exactly do you mean by that, Mamma?”

“Your uncle Elliott thinks he has an apartment and is living there with a woman.”

Isabel burst out laughing.

“You don't believe that, do you?”

“No. I honestly don't.”Mrs.Bradley looked reflectively at her nails.“Don't you ever talk to him about Chicago?”

“Yes, a lot.”

“Hasn't he given any sort of indication that he intends to come back?”

“I can't say he has.”

“He will have been gone two years next October.”

“I know.”

“Well, it's your business, dear, and you must do what you think right. But things don't get any easier by putting them off.”She glanced at her daughter, but Isabel would not meet her eyes.Mrs.Bradley gave her an affectionate smile.“If you don't want to be late for lunch you'd better go and have your bath.”

“I'm lunching with Larry. We're going to some place in the Latin Quarter.”

“Enjoy yourself.”

An hour later Larry came to fetch her. They took a cab to the Pont St.Michel and sauntered up the crowded boulevard till they came to a café they liked the look of.They sat down on the terrace and ordered a couple of Dubonnets.Then they took another cab and went to a restaurant.Isabel had a healthy appetite and she enjoyed the good things Larry ordered for her.She enjoyed looking at the people sitting cheek by jowl with them, for the place was packed, and it made her laugh to see the intense pleasure they so obviously took in their food；but she enjoyed above all sitting at a tiny table alone with Larry.She loved the amusement in his eyes while she chattered away gaily.It was enchanting to feel so much at home with him.But at the back of her mind was a vague disquiet, for though he seemed very much at home too, she felt it was not so much with her as with the surroundings.She had been faintly disturbed by what her mother had said, and though seeming to prattle so guilelessly she observed his every expression.He was not quite the same as when he had left Chicago, but she couldn’t tell in what the difference lay.He looked exactly as she remembered him, as young, as frank, but his expression was changed.It was not that he was more serious, his face in repose had always been serious, it had a calmness that was new to her；it was as though he had settled something with himself and were at ease in a way he had never been before.

When they had finished lunch he suggested that they should take a stroll through the Luxembourg.

“No, I don't want to go and look at pictures.”

“All right then, let's go and sit in the gardens.”

“No, I don't want to do that either. I want to go and see where you live.”

“There's nothing to see. I live in a scrubby little room in a hotel.”

“Uncle Elliott says you've got an apartment and are living in sin with an artist's model.”

“Come on then and see for yourself，”he laughed.“It's only a step from here. We can walk.”

He took her through narrow, tortuous streets, dingy notwithstanding the streak of blue sky that showed between the high houses, and after a while stopped at a small hotel with a pretentious façade.

“Here we are.”

Isabel followed him into a narrow hall, on one side of which was a desk and behind it a man in shirt-sleeves, with a waistcoat in thin black and yellow stripes and a dirty apron, reading a paper. Larry asked for his key, and the man handed it to him from the rack immediately behind him.He gave Isabel an inquisitive glance that turned into a knowing smirk.It was clear that he thought she was going to Larry's room for no honest purpose.

They climbed up two flights of stairs, on which was a threadbare red carpet, and Larry unlocked his door. Isabel entered a smallish room with two windows.They looked out on the grey apartment house opposite, on the ground floor of which was a stationer's shop.There was a single bed in the room, with a night table beside it, a heavy wardrobe with a large mirror, an upholstered but straight-backed armchair, and a table between the windows on which were a typewriter, papers, and a number of books.The chimney-piece was piled with paper-bound volumes.

“You sit in the armchair. It's not very comfortable, but it's the best I can offer.”

He drew up another chair and sat down.

“Is this where you live?”asked Isabel.

He chuckled at the look on her face.

“It is. I've been here ever since I came to Paris.”

“But why?”

“It's convenient. It's near the Bibliothèque Nationale and the Sorbonne.”He pointed to a door she had not noticed.“It’s got a bathroom.I can get breakfast here and I generally dine at that restaurant where we had lunch.”

“It's awfully sordid.”

“Oh no, it's all right. It's all I want.”

“But what sort of people live here?”

“Oh, I don't know. Up in the attics a few students.Two or three old bachelors in government offices and a retired actress at the Odéon；the only other room with a bath is occupied by a kept woman whose gentleman friend comes to see her every other Thursday；I suppose a few transients.It’s a very quiet and respectable place.”

Isabel was a trifle disconcerted and because she knew Larry noticed it and was amused she was half inclined to take offence.

“What's that great big book on the table?”she asked.

“That?Oh, that's my Greek dictionary.”

“Your what?”she cried.

“It's all right. It won't bite you.”

“Are you learning Greek?”

“Yes.”

“Why?”

“I thought I'd like to.”

He was looking at her with a smile in his eyes and she smiled back at him.

“Don't you think you might tell me what you've been up to all the time you've been in Paris?”

“I've been reading a good deal. Eight or ten hours a day.I've attended lectures at the Sorbonne.I think I've read everything that's important in French literature and I can read Latin, at least Latin prose, almost as easily as I can read French.Of course Greek's more difficult.But I have a very good teacher.Until you came here I used to go to him three evenings a week.”

“And what is that going to lead to?”

“The acquisition of knowledge，”he smiled.

“It doesn't sound very practical.”

“Perhaps it isn't and on the other hand perhaps it is. But it's enormous fun.You can't imagine what a thrill it is to read the Odyssey in the original.It makes you feel as if you had only to get on tiptoe and stretch out your hands to touch the stars.”

He got up from his chair, as though impelled by an excitement that seized him, and walked up and down the small room.

“I've been reading Spinoza the last month or two. I don't suppose I understand very much of it yet, but it fills me with exultation.It's like landing from your plane on a great plateau in the mountains.Solitude, and an air so pure that it goes to your head like wine and you feel like a million dollars.”

“When are you coming back to Chicago?”

“Chicago?I don't know. I haven't thought of it.”

“You said that if you hadn't got what you wanted after two years you'd give it up as a bad job.”

“I couldn't go back now. I'm on the threshold.I see vast lands of the spirit stretching out before me, beckoning, and I'm eager to travel them.”

“What do you expect to find in them?”

“The answers to my questions.”He gave her a glance that was almost playful, so that except that she knew him so well, she might have thought he was speaking in jest.“I want to make up my mind whether God is or God is not. I want to find out why evil exists.I want to know whether I have an immortal soul or whether when I die it's the end.”

Isabel gave a little gasp. It made her uncomfortable to hear Larry say such things, and she was thankful that he spoke so lightly, in the tone of ordinary conversation, that it was possible for her to overcome her embarrassment.

“But Larry，”she smiled.“People have been asking those questions for thousands of years. If they could be answered, surely they'd have been answered by now.”

Larry chuckled.

“Don't laugh as if I'd said something idiotic，”she said sharply.

“On the contrary I think you've said something shrewd. But on the other hand you might say that if men have been asking them for thousands of years it proves that they can't help asking them and have to go on asking them.Besides, it's not true that no one has found the answers.There are more answers than questions, and lots of people have found answers that were perfectly satisfactory for them.Old Ruysbroek for instance.”

“Who was he?”

“Oh, just a guy I didn't know at college，”Larry answered flippantly.

Isabel didn't know what he meant, but passed on.

“It all sounds so adolescent to me. Those are the sort of things sophomores get excited about and then when they leave college they forget about them.They have to earn a living.”

“I don't blame them. You see, I'm in the happy position that I have enough to live on.If I hadn't I'd have had to do like everybody else and make money.”

“But doesn't money mean anything to you?”

“Not a thing，”he grinned.

“How long d'you think all this is going to take you?”

“I wouldn't know. Five years.Ten years.”

“And after that?What are you going to do with all this wisdom?”

“If I ever acquire wisdom I suppose I shall be wise enough to know what to do with it.”

Isabel clasped her hands passionately and leant forwards in her chair.

“You're so wrong, Larry. You're an American.Your place isn't here.Your place is in America.”

“I shall come back when I'm ready.”

“But you're missing so much. How can you bear to sit here in a backwater just when we're living through the most wonderful adventure the world has ever known?Europe's finished.We're the greatest, the most powerful people in the world.We're going forward by leaps and bounds.We’ve got everything.It’s your duty to take part in the development of your country.You’ve forgotten, you don’t know how thrilling life is in America today.Are you sure you’re not doing this because you haven’t the courage to stand up to the work that’s before every American now?Oh, I know you’re working in a way, but isn’t it just an escape from your responsibilities?Is it more than just a sort of laborious idleness?What would happen to America if everyone shirked as you’re shirking?”

“You're very severe, honey，”he smiled.“The answer to that is that everyone doesn't feel like me. Fortunately for themselves, perhaps, most people are prepared to follow the normal course；what you forget is that I want to learn as passionately as-Gray, for instance, wants to make pots of money.Am I really a traitor to my country because I want to spend a few years educating myself?It may be that when I'm through I shall have something to give that people will be glad to take.It's only a chance, of course, but if I fail I shall be no worse off than a man who's gone into business and hasn’t made a go of it.”

“And what about me?Am I of no importance to you at all?”

“You're of very great importance. I want you to marry me.”

“When?In ten years?”

“No. Now.As soon as possible.”

“On what?Mamma can't afford to give me anything. Besides, she wouldn't if she could.She'd think it wrong to help you to live without doing anything.”

“I wouldn't want to take anything from your mother，”said Larry.“I've got three thousand a year. That's plenty in Paris.We could have a little apartment and a bonne à tout faire.We’d have such a lark, darling.”

“But, Larry, one can't live on three thousand a year.”

“Of course one can. Lots of people live on much less.”

“But I don't want to live on three thousand a year. There's no reason why I should.”

“I've been living on half that.”

“But how！”

She looked at the dingy little room with a shudder of distaste.

“It means I've got a bit saved up. We could go down to Capri for our honeymoon and then in the fall we'd go to Greece.I'm crazy to go there.Don't you remember how we used to talk about travelling all over the world together?”

“Of course I want to travel. But not like that.I don't want to travel second-class on steamships and put up at third-rate hotels, without a bathroom, and eat at cheap restaurants.”

“I went all through Italy last October like that. I had a wonderful time.We could travel all over the world on three thousand a year.”

“But I want to have babies, Larry.”

“That's all right. We'll take them along with us.”

“You're so silly，”she laughed.“D'you know what it costs to have a baby?Violet Tomlinson had one last year and she did it as cheaply as she could and it cost her twelve hundred and fifty. And what d'you think a nurse costs?”She grew more vehement as one idea after another occurred to her.“You're so impractical.You don't know what you’re asking me to do.I’m young, I want to have fun.I want to do all the things that people do.I want to go to parties, I want to go to dances, I want to play golf and ride horseback.I want to wear nice clothes.Can’t you imagine what it means to a girl not to be as well dressed as the rest of her crowd?D’you know what it means, Larry, to buy your friends’old dresses when they’re sick of them and be thankful when someone out of pity makes you a present of a new one?I couldn’t even afford to go to a decent hairdresser to have my hair properly done.I don’t want to go about in street-cars and omnibuses；I want to have my own car.And what d’you suppose I’d find to do with myself all day long while you were reading at the Library?Walk about the streets window-shopping or sit in the Luxembourg Garden seeing that my children didn’t get into mischief?We wouldn’t have any friends.”

“Oh, Isabel，”he interrupted.

“Not the sort of friends I'm used to. Oh yes, Uncle Elliott's friends would ask us now and then for his sake, but we couldn't go because I wouldn't have the clothes to go in, and we wouldn't go because we couldn’t afford to return their hospitality.I don’t want to know a lot of scrubby, unwashed people；I’ve got nothing to say to them and they’ve got nothing to say to me.I want to live, Larry.”She grew suddenly conscious of the look in his eyes, tender as it always was when fixed on her, but gently amused.“You think I’m silly, don’t you?You think I’m being trivial and horrid.”

“No, I don't. I think what you say is very natural.”

He was standing with his back to the fireplace, and she got up and went up to him so that they were face to face.

“Larry, if you hadn't a cent to your name and got a job that brought you in three thousand a year I'd marry you without a minute's hesitation. I'd cook for you, I'd make the beds, I wouldn’t care what I wore, I’d go without anything, I’d look upon it as wonderful fun, because I’d know that it was only a question of time and you’d make good.But this means living in a sordid beastly way all our lives with nothing to look forward to.It means that I should be a drudge to the day of my death.And for what?So that you can spend years trying to find answers to questions that you say yourself are insoluble.It’s so wrong.A man ought to work.That’s what he’s here for.That’s how he contributes to the welfare of the community.”

“In short it's his duty to settle down in Chicago and enter Henry Maturin's business. Do you think that by getting my friends to buy the securities that Henry Maturin is interested in I should add greatly to the welfare of the community?”

“There must be brokers and it's a perfectly decent and honourable way of earning a living.”

“You've drawn a very black picture of life in Paris on a moderate income. You know, it isn't really like that.One can dress very nicely without going to Chanel.And all the interesting people don't live in the neighbourhood of the Arc de Triomphe and the Avenue Foch.In fact few interesting people do, because interesting people generally don't have a lot of money.I know quite a number of people here, painters and writers and students, French, English, American, and what not, whom I think you'd find much more amusing than Elliott’s seedy marquises and long-nosed duchesses.You’ve got a quick mind and a lively sense of humour.You’d enjoy hearing them swap ideas across the dinner table even though the wine was only vin ordinaire and you didn’t have a butler and a couple of footmen to wait on you.”

“Don't be stupid, Larry. Of course I would.You know I'm not a snob.I'd love to meet interesting people.”

“Yes, in a Chanel dress. D'you think they wouldn't catch on to it that you looked upon it as a sort of cultured slumming?They wouldn't be at their ease, any more than you would, and you wouldn't get anything out of it except to tell Emily de Montadour and Gracie de Château-Gaillard afterwards what fun you’d had meeting a lot of weird bohemians in the Latin Quarter.”

Isabel slightly shrugged her shoulders.

“I dare say you're right. They're not the sort of people I've been brought up with.They're not the sort of people I have anything in common with.”

“Where does that leave us?”

“Just where we started. I've lived in Chicago ever since I can remember.All my friends are there.All my interests are there.I'm at home there.It's where I belong and it's where you belong.Mamma's ill and she’s never going to get any better.I couldn’t leave her even if I wanted to.”

“Does that mean that unless I'm prepared to come back to Chicago you don't want to marry me?”

Isabel hesitated. She loved Larry.She wanted to marry him.She wanted him with all the power of her senses.She knew that he desired her.She couldn't believe that when it came to a showdown he wouldn't weaken.She was afraid, but she had to risk it.

“Yes, Larry, that's just what it does mean.”

He struck a match on the chimney-piece, one of those old-fashioned French sulphur matches that fill your nostrils with an acrid odour, and lit his pipe. Then, passing her, he went over and stood by one of the windows.He looked out.He was silent for what seemed an endless time.She stood as she had stood before, when she was facing him, and looked in the mirror over the chimney-piece, but she did not see herself.Her heart was beating madly and she was sick with apprehension.He turned at last.

“I wish I could make you see how much fuller the life I offer you is than anything you have a conception of. I wish I could make you see how exciting the life of the spirit is and how rich in experience.It's illimitable.It's such a happy life.There's only one thing like it, when you're up in a plane by yourself, high, high, and only infinity surrounds you.You're intoxicated by the boundless space.You feel such a sense of exhilaration that you wouldn’t exchange it for all the power and glory in the world.I was reading Descartes the other day.The ease, the grace, the lucidity.Gosh！”

“But Larry，”she interrupted him desperately，“don't you see you're asking something of me that I'm not fitted for, that I'm not interested in and don't want to be interested in?How often have I got to repeat to you that I’m just an ordinary, normal girl. I’m twenty, in ten years I shall be old, I want to have a good time while I have the chance.Oh, Larry, I do love you so terribly.All this is just trifling.It’s not going to lead you anywhere.For your own sake I beseech you to give it up.Be a man, Larry, and do a man’s work.You’re just wasting the precious years that others are doing so much with.Larry, if you love me you won’t give me up for a dream.You’ve had your fling.Come back with us to America.”

“I can't, darling. It would be death to me.It would be the betrayal of my soul.”

“Oh, Larry, why d'you talk in that way?That's the way hysterical, highbrow women talk. What does it mean?Nothing.Nothing.Nothing.”

“It happens to mean exactly what I feel，”he answered, his eyes twinkling.

“How can you laugh?Don't you realize this is desperately serious?We've come to the cross-roads and what we do now is going to affect our whole lives.”

“I know that. Believe me, I'm perfectly serious.”

She sighed.

“If you won't listen to reason there's nothing more to be said.”

“But I don't think it's reason. I think you've been talking the most terrible nonsense all the time.”

“I?”If she hadn't been so miserable she would have laughed.“My poor Larry, you're as crazy as a coot.”

She slowly slipped her engagement ring off her finger. She placed it on the palm of her hand and looked at it.It was a square-cut ruby set in a thin platinum band and she had always liked it.

“If you loved me you wouldn't make me so unhappy.”

“I do love you. Unfortunately sometimes one can't do what one thinks is right without making someone else unhappy.”

She stretched out her hand on which the ruby was resting and forced a smile to her trembling lips.

“Here you are, Larry.”

“It's no good to me. Won't you keep it as a memento of our friendship?You can wear it on your little finger.Our friendship needn't stop, need it?”

“I shall always care for you, Larry.”“Then keep it. I should like you to.”

She hesitated for an instant, then put it on the finger of her right hand.

“It's too large.”

“You can have it altered. Let's go to the Ritz bar and have a drink.”

“All right.”

She was a trifle taken aback that it had all gone so easily. She had not cried.Nothing seemed to be changed except that now she wasn't going to marry Larry.She could hardly believe that everything was over and done with.She resented a little the fact that they hadn't had a terrific scene.They had talked it all over almost as coolly as though they had been discussing the taking of a house.She felt let down, but at the same time was conscious of a slight sense of satisfaction because they had behaved in such a civilized way.She would have given a lot to know exactly what Larry was feeling.But it was always difficult to know that；his smooth face, his dark eyes were a mask that she was aware even she, who had known him for so many years, could not penetrate.She had taken off her hat and laid it on the bed.Now, standing before the mirror, she put it on again.

“Just as a matter of interest，”she said, arranging her hair，“did you want to break our engagement?”

“No.”

“I thought it might be a relief to you.”He made no reply. She turned round with a gay smile on her lips.“Now I'm ready.”

Larry locked the door behind him. When he handed the key to the man at the desk he enveloped them both in a look of conniving archness.It was impossible for Isabel not to guess what he thought they had been up to.

“I don't believe that old fellow would bet much on my virginity，”she said.

They took a taxi to the Ritz and had a drink. They spoke of indifferent things, without apparent constraint, like two old friends who saw one another every day.Though Larry was naturally silent, Isabel was a talkative girl, with an ample fund of chit-chat, and she was determined that no silence should fall between them that might be hard to break.She wasn't going to let Larry think she felt any resentment towards him and her pride constrained her to act so that he should not suspect that she was hurt and unhappy.Presently she suggested that he should drive her home.When he dropped her at the door she said to him gaily：

“Don't forget that you're lunching with us tomorrow.”

“You bet your life I won't.”

She gave him her cheek to kiss and passed through the porte cochère.

When Isabel entered the drawing-room she found that some people had dropped in to tea. There were two American women who lived in Paris, exquisitely gowned, with strings of pearls round their necks, diamond bracelets on their wrists and costly rings on their fingers.Though the hair of one was darkly hennaed and that of the other unnaturally golden they were strangely alike.They had the same heavily mascaraed eyelashes, the same brightly painted lips, the same rouged cheeks, the same slim figures, maintained at the cost of extreme mortification, the same clear, sharp features, the same hungry restless eyes；and you could not but be conscious that their lives were a desperate struggle to maintain their fading charms.They talked with inanity in a loud, metallic voice without a moment's pause, as though afraid that if they were silent for an instant the machine would run down and the artificial construction which was all they were would fall to pieces.There was also a secretary from the American Embassy, suave, silent, for he could not get a word in, and very much the man of the world, and a small dark Rumanian prince, all bows and servility, with little darting black eyes and a clean-shaven swarthy face, who was for ever jumping up to hand a teacup, pass a plate of cakes, or light a cigarette, and who shamelessly dished out to those present the most flattering, the most gross compliments.He was paying for all the dinners he had received from the objects of his adulation and for all the dinners he hoped to receive.

Mrs. Bradley, seated at the tea table and dressed to please Elliott somewhat more grandly than she thought suitable to the occasion, performed her duties as hostess with her usual civil but rather indifferent composure.What she thought of her brother's guests I can only imagine.I never knew her more than slightly and she was a woman who kept herself to herself.She was not a stupid woman；in all the years she had lived in foreign capitals she had met innumerable people of all kinds and I think she summed them up shrewdly enough according to the standards of the small Virginian town where she was born and bred.I think she got a certain amount of amusement from observing their antics, and I don't believe she took their airs and graces any more seriously than she took the aches and pains of the characters in a novel which she knew from the beginning（otherwise she wouldn't have read it）would end happily.Paris, Rome, Peking had had no more effect on her Americanism than Elliott's devout Catholicism on her robust, but not inconvenient, Presbyterian faith.

Isabel, with her youth, her strapping good looks, and her vitality, brought a breath of fresh air into that meretricious atmosphere. She swept in like a young earth goddess.The Rumanian prince leapt to his feet to draw forward a chair for her and with ample gesticulation did his shift.The two American ladies, with shrill amiabilities on their lips, looked her up and down, took in the details of her dress, and perhaps in their hearts felt a pang of dismay at being confronted with her exuberant youth.The American diplomat smiled to himself as he saw how false and haggard she made them look.But Isabel thought they were grand；she liked their rich clothes and expensive pearls and felt a twinge of envy for their sophisticated poise.She wondered if she would ever achieve that supreme elegance.Of course the little Rumanian was quite ridiculous, but he was rather sweet and even if he didn't mean the charming things he said it was nice to listen to them.The conversation which her entrance had interrupted was resumed, and they talked so brightly, with so much conviction that what they were saying was worth saying, that you almost thought they were talking sense.They talked of the parties they had been to and the parties they were going to.They gossiped about the latest scandal.They tore their friends to pieces.They bandied great names from one to the other.They seemed to know everybody.They were in on all the secrets.Almost in a breath they touched upon the latest play, the latest dressmaker, the latest portrait painter, and the latest mistress of the latest premier.One would have thought there was nothing they didn't know.Isabel listened with ravishment.It all seemed to her wonderfully civilized.This really was life.It gave her a thrilling sense of being in the midst of things.This was real.The setting was perfect.That spacious room with the Savonnerie carpet on the floor, the lovely drawings on the richly-panelled walls, the petit-point chairs on which they sat, the priceless pieces of marquetry, commodes and occasional tables, every piece worthy to go into a museum；it must have cost a fortune, that room, but it was worth it.Its beauty, its discretion struck her as never before because she had still so vividly in her mind the shabby little hotel room, with its iron bed and that hard, comfortless chair in which he had sat, that room that Larry saw nothing wrong in.It was bare, cheerless, and horrid.It made her shudder to remember it.

The party broke up and Isabel was left with her mother and Elliott.

“Charming women，”said Elliott when he came back from seeing the two poor painted drabs to the door.“I knew them when they first settled in Paris. I never dreamt they'd turn out as well as they have.It's amazing, the adaptability of our women.You'd hardly know now they were Americans and Middle West into the bargain.”

Mrs. Bradley, raising her eyebrows, without speaking gave him a look which he was too quick-witted not to understand.

“No one could ever say that of you, my poor Louisa，”he continued half acidly and half affectionately.“Though heaven knows, you've had every chance.”

Mrs. Bradley pursed her lips.

“I'm afraid I've been a sad disappointment to you, Elliott, but to tell you the truth I'm very satisfied with myself as I am.”

“Tous les goûts sont dans la nature，”Elliott murmured.

“I think I ought to tell you that I'm no longer engaged to Larry，”said Isabel.

“Tut，”cried Elliott.“That'll put my luncheon table out for tomorrow. How on earth am I going to get another man at this short notice?”

“Oh, he's coming to lunch all right.”

“After you've broken off your engagement?That sounds very unconventional.”

Isabel giggled. She kept her gaze on Elliott, for she knew her mother's eyes were fixed upon her and she didn't want to meet them.

“We haven't quarrelled. We talked it over this afternoon and came to the conclusion we'd made a mistake.He doesn't want to come back to America；he wants to stop on in Paris.He's talking of going to Greece.”

“What on earth for?There's no society in Athens. As a matter of fact I never thought so much of Greek art myself.Some of that Hellenistic stuff has a certain decadent charm that's rather attractive.But Phidias：no, no.”

“Look at me, Isabel，”said Mrs. Bradley.

Isabel turned and with a faint smile on her lips faced her mother. Mrs.Bradley gave her a scrutinizing stare, but all she said was，“H'm.”The girl hadn't been crying, that she saw；she looked calm and composed.

“I think you're well out of it, Isabel，”said Elliott.“I was prepared to make the best of it, but I never thought it a good match. He wasn't really up to your mark, and the way he's been behaving in Paris is a pretty clear indication that he'll never amount to anything.With your looks and your connexions you can aspire to something better than that.I think you've behaved in a very sensible manner.”

Mrs. Bradley gave her daughter a glance that was not devoid of anxiety.

“You haven't done this on my account, Isabel?”

Isabel shook her head decidedly.

“No, darling, I've done it entirely on my own.”

I had come back from the East and was spending some time in London just then. It was perhaps a fortnight after the events I have just related that Elliott called me up one morning.I was not surprised to hear his voice, for I knew that he was in the habit of coming to England to enjoy the fag end of the season.He told me that Mrs.Bradley and Isabelwere with him and if I would drop in that evening at six for a drink they would be glad to see me.They were, of course, staying at Claridge's.I was at that time living not far from there, so I strolled down Park Lane and through the quiet, dignified streets of Mayfair till I came to the hotel.Elliott had his usual suite.It was panelled in brown wood like the wood of a cigar box and furnished with quiet sumptuousness.He was alone when I was ushered in.Mrs.Bradley and Isabel had gone shopping and he was expecting them at any minute.He told me that Isabel had broken her engagement to Larry.

Elliott with his romantic and highly conventional sense of how people should comport themselves under given circumstances had been disconcerted by the young people's behaviour. Not only had Larry come to lunch the very day after the break, but he had acted as though his position were unchanged.He was as pleasant, attentive, and soberly gay as usual.He treated Isabel with the same comradely affectionateness with which he had always treated her.He seemed neither harassed, upset, nor woebegone.Nor did Isabel appear dispirited.She looked as happy, she laughed as lightly, she jested as merrily as though she had not just taken a decisive and surely searing step in her life.Elliott could not make head or tail of it.From such scraps of their conversation as he caught he gathered that they had no intention of breaking any of the dates they had made.On the first opportunity he talked it over with his sister.

“It's not decent，”he said.“They can't run around together as if they were still engaged. Larry really should have more sense of propriety.Besides, it damages Isabel's chances.Young Fotheringham, that boy at the British Embassy, is obviously taken with her；he's got money and he's very well connected；if he knew the coast was clear I wouldn’t be at all surprised if he made her an offer, I think you ought to talk to her about it.”

“My dear, Isabel's twenty and she has a technique for telling you to mind your own business without offensiveness which I've always found very difficult to cope with.”

“Then you've brought her up extremely badly, Louisa. And besides, it is your business.”

“That is a point on which you and she would certainly differ.”

“You're trying my patience, Louisa.”

“My poor Elliott, if you'd ever had a grown-up daughter you'd know that by comparison a bucking steer is easy to manage. And as to knowing what goes on inside her-well, it's much better to pretend you're the simple, innocent old fool she almost certainly takes you for.”

“But you have talked the matter over with her?”

“I tried to. She laughed at me and told me there was really nothing to tell.”

“Is she cut up?”

“I wouldn't know. All I do know is that she eats well and sleeps like a child.”

“Well, take my word for it, if you let them go on like this they'll go off one of these days and get married without saying a word to anybody.”

Mrs. Bradley permitted herself to smile.

“It must be a relief to you to think that at present we're living in a country where every facility is afforded to sexual irregularity and every obstacle put in the way of marriage.”

“And quite rightly. Marriage is a serious matter on which rest the security of the family and the stability of the state.But marriage can only maintain its authority if extra-conjugal relations are not only tolerated but sanctioned.Prostitution, my poor Louisa—”

“That'll do, Elliott，'interrupted Mrs. Bradley.“I'm not interested in your views on the social and moral values of promiscuous fornication.”

It was then he put forward a scheme that would interrupt Isabel's continued intercourse with Larry, which was so repugnant to his sense of what was fitting. The Paris season was drawing to a close and all the best people were arranging to go to watering places or to Deauville before repairing for the rest of the summer to their ancestral châteaux in Touraine, Anjou, or Brittany.Ordinarily Elliott went to London at the end of June, but his family feeling was strong and his affection for his sister and Isabel sincere；he had been quite ready to sacrifice himself and remain in Paris, ifthey wished it, when no one who was anyone was there；but he found himself now in the agreeable situation of being able to do what was best for others and at the same time what was convenient to himself.He proposed to Mrs.Bradley that the three of them should go to London immediately, where the season was still in full swing and where new interests and new friends would distract Isabel’s mind from her unfortunate entanglement.According to the papers the great specialist on Mrs.Bradley’s disease was then in the British capital and the desirability of consulting him would reasonably account for their precipitate departure and override any disinclination to leave Paris that Isabel might have.Mrs.Bradley fell in with the plan.She was puzzled by Isabel.She could not make up her mind whether she was as carefree as she seemed or whether, hurt, angry, or heartsick, she was putting on a bold front to conceal her wounded feelings.Mrs.Bradley could only agree with Elliott that it would do Isabel good to see new people and new places.

Elliott got busy on the telephone and when Isabel, who had been spending the day at Versailles with Larry, came home, he was able to tell her that he had made an appointment for her mother to see the celebrated doctor three days from then, that he had engaged a suite at Claridge's and that they were starting on the next day but one. Mrs.Bradley watched her daughter while this intelligence was being somewhat smugly imparted to her by Elliott, but she did not turn a hair.

“Oh, darling, I'm so glad you're going to see that doctor，”she cried with her usual rather breathless impetuosity.“Of course, you mustn't miss the chance. And it'll be grand going to London.How long are we going to stay?”

“It would be useless to come back to Paris，”said Elliott.“There won't be a soul here in a week. I want you to stay with me at Claridge's for the rest of the season.There are always some good balls in July and of course there's Wimbledon.And then Goodwood and Cowes.I'm sure the Ellinghams will be glad to have us on their yacht for Cowes and the Bantocks always have a large party for Goodwood.”

Isabel appeared to be delighted and Mrs. Bradley was reassured.It looked as though she were not giving Larry a thought.

Elliott had just finished telling me all this when mother and daughter came in. I had not seen them for more than eighteen months.Mrs.Bradley was a little thinner than before and more pasty-faced；she looked tired and none too well.But Isabel was blooming.With her high colour, the rich brown of her hair, her shining hazel eyes, her clear skin, she gave an impression of such youth, of so much enjoyment of the mere fact of being alive, that you felt half inclined to laugh with delight.She gave me the rather absurd notion of a pear, golden and luscious, perfectly ripe and simply asking to be eaten.She radiated warmth so that you thought that if you held out your hands you could feel its comfort.She looked taller than when I had last seen her, whether because she wore higher heels or because the clever dressmaker had cut her frock to conceal her youthful plumpness I don't know, and she held herself with the graceful ease of a girl who has played outdoor games since childhood.She was in short sexually a very attractive young woman.Had I been her mother I should have thought it high time she was married.

Glad of the opportunity to repay some of the kindness I had received from Mrs. Bradley in Chicago, I asked them all three to come to a play with me one evening.I arranged to give a luncheon for them.

“You'll be wise to get in at once, my dear fellow，”said Elliott.“I've already let my friends know we're here and I presume that in a day or two we shall be fixed up for the rest of the season.”

I understood by this that Elliott meant that then they would have no time for the likes of me and I laughed. Elliott gave me a glance in which I discerned a certain hauteur.

“But of course you'll generally find us here about six o'clock and we shall always be glad to see you，”he said graciously, but with the evident intention of putting me, as an author, in my humble place.

But the worm sometimes turns.

“You must try to get in touch with the St. Olpherds，”I said.“I hear they want to dispose of their Constable of Salisbury Cathedral.”

“I'm not buying any pictures just now.”

“I know, but I thought you might dispose of it for them.”

A steely glitter came into Elliott's eyes.

“My dear fellow, the English are a great people, but they have never been able to paint and never will be able to paint. I am not interested in the English school.”

During the next four weeks I saw little of Elliott and his relations. He did them proud.He took them for a week-end to a grand house in Sussex and for another week-end to an even grander one in Wiltshire.He took them to the royal box at the opera as guests of a minor princess of the House of Windsor.He took them to lunch and dine with the great.Isabel went to several balls.He entertained at Claridge's a series of guests whose names made a fine show in the paper next day.He gave supper parties at Ciro's and the Embassy.In fact he did all the right things and Isabel would have had to be much more sophisticated than she was not to have been a trifle dazzled by the splendour and elegance he provided for her delectation.Elliott could flatter himself that he was taking all this trouble from the purely unselfish motive of distracting Isabel's mind from an unfortunate love affair；but I had a notion he got besides a good deal of satisfaction out of letting his sister see with her own eyes how familiar he was with the illustrious and fashionable.He was an admirable host and he took a delight in displaying his virtuosity.

I went to one or two of his parties myself and now and again I dropped in at Claridge's at six o'clock. I found Isabel surrounded by strapping young men in beautiful clothes who were in the Household Brigade or by elegant young men in less beautiful clothes from the Foreign Office.It was on one of these occasions that she drew me aside.

“I want to ask you something，”she said.“Do you remember that evening we went to a drugstore and had an ice-cream soda?”

“Perfectly.”

“You were very nice and helpful then. Will you be nice and helpful again?”

“I'll do my best.”

“I want to talk to you about something. Couldn't we lunch one day?”

“Almost any day you like.”

“Somewhere quiet.”

“What d'you say to driving down to Hampton Court and lunching there?The gardens should be at their best just now and you could see Queen Elizabeth's bed.”

The notion suited her and we fixed a day. But when the day came the weather, which had been fine and warm, broke；the sky was grey and a drizzling rain was falling.I called up and asked her if she wouldn't prefer to lunch in town.

“We shouldn't be able to sit in the gardens and the pictures will be so dark, we shan't see a thing.”

“I've sat in lots of gardens and I'm fed to the teeth with old masters. Let's go anyway.”

“All right.”

I fetched her and we drove down. I knew a small hotel where one ate tolerably and we went straight there.On the way Isabel talked with her usual vivacity of the parties she had been to and the people she had met.She had been enjoying herself, but her comments on various acquaintances she had made suggested to me that she had shrewdness and a quick eye for the absurd.The bad weather kept visitors away and we were the only occupants of the dining-room.The hotel specialized in homely English fare and we had a cut off a leg of excellent lamb with green peas and new potatoes and a deep-dish apple pie with Devonshire cream to follow.With a tankard of pale ale it made an excellent lunch.When we had finished I suggested that we should go into the empty coffee-room where there were armchairs in which we could sit in comfort.It was chilly in there, but the fire was laid, so I put a match to it.The flames made the dingy room more companionable.

“That's that，”I said.“Now tell me what you want to talk to me about.”

“It's the same as last time，”she chuckled.“Larry.”

“So I guessed.”

“You know that we've broken off our engagement.”

“Elliott told me.”

“Mamma's relieved and he's delighted.”

She hesitated for a moment and then embarked upon the account of her talk with Larry of which I have done my best faithfully to inform the reader. It may surprise the reader that she should have chosen to tell so much to someone whom she knew so little.I don't suppose I had seen her a dozen times and, except for that one occasion at the drugstore, never alone.It did not surprise me.For one thing, as any writer will tell you, people do tell a writer things that they don't tell others.I don't know why, unless it is that having read one or two of his books they feel on peculiarly intimate terms with him；or it may be that they dramatize themselves and, seeing themselves as it were as characters in a novel, are ready to be as open with him as they imagine the characters of his invention are.And I think that Isabel felt that I liked Larry and her, and that their youth touched me, and that I was sympathetic to their distresses.She could not expect to find a friendly listener in Elliott who was disinclined to trouble himself with a young man who had spurned the best chance a young man ever had of getting to society.Nor could her mother help her.Mrs.Bradley had high principles and common sense.Her common sense assured her that if you wanted to get on in this world you must accept its conventions, and not to do what everybody else did clearly pointed to instability.Her high principles led her to believe that a man's duty was to go to work in a business where by energy and initiative he had a chance of earning enough money to keep his wife and family in accordance with the standards of his station, give his sons such an education as would enable them on reaching man's estate to make an honest living, and on his death leave his widow adequately provided for.

Isabel had a good memory and the various turns of the long discussion had engraved themselves upon it. I listened in silence till she had finished.She only interrupted herself once to ask me a question.

“Who was Ruysdael?”

“Ruysdael?He was a Dutch landscape painter. Why?”

She told me that Larry had mentioned him. He had said that Ruysdael at least had found an answer to the questions he was asking, and she repeated to me his flippant reply when she had inquired who he was.

“What d'you suppose he meant?”

I had an inspiration.

“Are you sure he didn't say Ruysbroek?”

“He might have. Who was he?”

“He was a Flemish mystic who lived in the fourteenth century.”

“Oh，”she said with disappointment.

It meant nothing to her. But it meant something to me.That was the first indication I had of the turn Larry's reflection was taking, and while she went on with her story, though still listening attentively, part of my mind busied itself with the possibilities that reference of his had suggested.I did not want to make too much of it, for it might be that he had only mentioned the name of the Ecstatic Teacher to make an argumentative point；it might also have a significance that had escaped Isabel.When he answered her question by saying Ruysbroek was just a guy he hadn't known in college he evidently meant to throw her off the scent.

“What do you make of it all?”she asked when she had come to an end.

I paused before replying.

“D'you remember his saying that he was just going to loaf?If what he tells you is true his loafing seems to involve some very strenuous work.”

“I'm sure it's true. But don't you see that if he'd worked as hard at any productive form of work he'd be earning a decent income?”

“There are people who are strangely constituted. There are criminals who'll work like beavers to contrive schemes that land them in prison and they no sooner get out than they start all over again and again land in prison.If they put as much industry, as much cleverness, resource, and patience into honest practices they could make a handsome living and occupy important positions.But they're just made that way.They like crime.”

“Poor Larry，”she giggled.“You're not going to suggest that he's learning Greek to cook up a bank robbery.”

I laughed too.

“No, I'm not. What I'm trying to tell you is that there are men who are possessed by an urge so strong to do some particular thing that they can't help themselves, they've got to do it.They're prepared to sacrifice everything to satisfy their yearning.”

“Even the people who love them?”

“Oh, yes.”

“Is that anything more than plain selfishness?”

“I wouldn't know，”I smiled.

“What can be the possible use of Larry's learning dead languages?”

“Some people have a disinterested desire for knowledge. It's not an ignoble desire.”

“What's the good of knowledge if you're not going to do anything with it?”

“Perhaps he is. Perhaps it will be sufficient satisfaction merely to know, as it's a sufficient satisfaction to an artist to produce a work of art.And perhaps it's only a step towards something further.”

“If he wanted knowledge why couldn't he go to college when he came back from the war?It's what Dr. Nelson and Mamma wanted him to do.”

“I talked to him about that in Chicago. A degree would be of no use to him.I have an inkling that he had a definite idea of what he wanted and felt he couldn't get it at a university.You know, in learning there's the lone wolf as well as the wolf who runs in the pack.I think Larry is one of those persons who can go no other way than their own.”

“I remember once asking him if he wanted to write. He laughed and said he had nothing to write about.”

“That's the most inconclusive reason for not writing that I've ever heard，”I smiled.

Isabel made a gesture of impatience. She was in no mood even for the mildest jest.

“What I can't make out is why he should have turned out like this. Before the war he was just like everybody else.You wouldn't think it, but he plays a very good game of tennis and he's quite a decent golfer.He used to do all the things the rest of us did.He was a perfectly normal boy and there was no reason to suppose he wouldn't become a perfectly normal man.After all you're a novelist, you ought to be able to explain it.”

“Who am I to explain the infinite complexities of human nature?”

“That's why I wanted to talk to you today，”she added, taking no notice of what I said.

“Are you unhappy?”

“No, not exactly unhappy. When Larry isn't there I'm all right；it's when I'm with him that I feel so weak.Now it's just a sort of ache, like the stiffness you get after a long ride when you haven’t been on a horse for months；it’s not pain, it’s not at all unbearable, but you’re conscious of it.I shall get over it all right.I hate the idea of Larry making such a mess of his life.”

“Perhaps he won't. It's a long, arduous road he's starting to travel, but it may be that at the end of it he'll find what he's seeking.”

“What's that?”

“Hasn't it occurred to you?It seems to me that in what he said to you he indicated it pretty plainly. God.”

“God！”she cried. But it was an exclamation of incredulous surprise.Our use of the same word, but in such a different sense, had a comic effect, so that we were obliged to laugh.But Isabel immediately grew serious again and I felt in her whole attitude something like fear.“What on earth makes you think that?”

“I'm only guessing. But you asked me to tell you what I thought as a novelist.Unfortunately you don't know whatexperience he had in the war that so profoundly moved him.I think it was some sudden shock for which he was unprepared.I suggest to you that whatever it was that happened to Larry filled him with a sense of the transiency of life, and an anguish to be sure that there was a compensation for the sin and sorrow of the world.”

I could see that Isabel didn't like the turn I had given the conversation. It made her feel shy and awkward.

“Isn't all that awfully morbid?One has to take the world as it comes. If we're here, it's surely to make the most of life.”

“You're probably right.”

“I don't pretend to be anything but a perfectly normal, ordinary girl. I want to have fun.”

“It looks as though there were complete incompatibility of temper between you. It's much better that you should have found it out before marriage.”

“I want to marry and have children and live—”

“In that state of life in which a merciful Providence has been pleased to place you，”I interrupted, smiling.

“Well, there's no harm in that, is there?It's a very pleasant state and I'm quite satisfied with it.”

“You're like two friends who want to take their holiday together, but one of them wants to climb Greenland's icy mountains while the other wants to fish off India's coral strand. Obviously it's not going to work.”

“Anyway, I might get a sealskin coat off Greenland's icy mountains, and I think it's very doubtful if there are any fish off India's coral strand.”

“That remains to be seen.”

“Why d'you say that?”she asked, frowning a little.“All the time you seem to be making some sort of mental reservation. Of course I know that I'm not playing the star part in this.Larry's got that.He's the idealist, he's the dreamer of a beautiful dream, and even if the dream doesn’t come true, it’s rather thrilling to have dreamt it.I’m cast for the hard, mercenary, practical part.Common sense is never very sympathetic, is it?But what you forget is that it’s I who’d have to pay.Larry would sweep along, trailing clouds of glory, and all there’d be left for me would be to tag along and make both ends meet.I want to live.”

“I don't forget that at all. Years ago, when I was young, I knew a man who was a doctor, and not a bad one either, but he didn't practise.He spent years burrowing away in the library of the British Museum and at long intervals produced a huge pseudo-scientific, pseudo-philosophical book that nobody read and that he had to publish at his own expense.He wrote four or five of them before he died and they were absolutely worthless.He had a son who wanted to go into the army, but there was no money to send him to Sandhurst, so he had to enlist.He was killed in the war.He had a daughter too.She was very pretty and I was rather taken with her.She went on the stage, but she had no talent and she traipsed around the provinces playing small parts in second-rate companies at a miserable salary.His wife, after years of dreary, sordid drudgery, broke down in health and the girl had to come home and nurse her and take on the drudgery her mother no longer had the strength for.Wasted, thwarted lives and all to no purpose.It's a toss-up when you decide to leave the beaten track.Many are called but few are chosen.”

“Mother and Uncle Elliott approve of what I've done. Do you approve too?”

“My dear, what can that matter to you?I'm almost a stranger to you.”

“I look upon you as a disinterested observer，”she said, with a pleasant smile.“I should like to have your approval. You do think I've done right, don't you?”

“I think you've done right for you，”I said, fairly confident that she would not catch the slight distinction I made in my reply.

“Then why have I a bad conscience?”

“Have you?”

With a smile still on her lips, but a slightly rueful smile now, she nodded.

“I know it's only horse sense. I know that every reasonable person would agree that I've done the only possible thing.I know that from every practical standpoint, from the standpoint of worldly wisdom, from the standpoint ofcommon decency, from the standpoint of what's right and wrong, I've done what I ought to do.And yet at the bottom of my heart I've got an uneasy feeling that if I were better, if I were more disinterested, more unselfish, nobler, I’d marry Larry and lead his life.If I only loved him enough I’d think the world well lost.”

“You might put it the other way about. If he loved you enough he wouldn't have hesitated to do what you want.”

“I've said that to myself too. But it doesn't help.I suppose it's more in woman's nature to sacrifice herself than in a man's.”She chuckled.“Ruth and the alien corn and all that sort of thing.”

“Why don't you risk it?”

We had been talking quite lightly, almost as if we were having a casual conversation about people we both knew but in whose affairs we were not intimately concerned, and even when she narrated to me her talk with Larry, Isabel had spoken with a sort of breezy gaiety, enlivening it with humour, as if she did not want me to take what she said too seriously. But now she went pale.

“I'm afraid.”

For a while we were silent. A chill went down my spine as it strangely does when I am confronted with deep and genuine human emotion.I find it terrible and rather awe-inspiring.

“Do you love him very much?”I asked at last.

“I don't know. I'm impatient with him.I'm exasperated with him.I keep longing for him.”

Silence again fell upon us. I didn't know what to say.The coffee-room in which we sat was small, and heavy lace curtains over the window shut out the light.On the walls, covered with yellow marbled paper, were old sporting prints.With its mahogany furniture, its shabby leather chairs, and its musty smell, it was strangely reminiscent of a coffee-room in a Dickens novel.I poked the fire and put more coal on it.Isabel suddenly began to speak.

“You see, I thought when it came to a showdown he'd knuckle under. I knew he was weak.”

“Weak?”I cried.“What made you think that?A man who for a year withstood the disapproval of all his friends and associates because he was determined to go his own way.”

“I could always do anything I wanted with him. I could turn him round my little finger.He was never a leader in the things we did.He just tagged along with the crowd.”

I had lit a cigarette and watched the smoke ring I had made. It grew larger and larger and then faded away into the air.

“Mamma and Elliott thought it very wrong of me to go about with him afterwards as though nothing had happened, but I didn't take it very seriously. I kept on thinking up to the end that he'd yield.I couldn't believe that when he'd got it into his thick head that I meant what I said he wouldn't give in.”She hesitated and gave me a smile of roguish, playful malice.“Will you be awfully shocked if I tell you something?”

“I think it very unlikely.”

“When we decided to come to London I called Larry and asked him if we couldn't spend my last evening in Paris together. When I told them, Uncle Elliott said it was most improper and Mamma said she thought it unnecessary.When Mamma says something is unnecessary it means she thoroughly disapproves.Uncle Elliott asked me what the idea was and I said we were going to dine somewhere and then make a tour of the night clubs.He told Mamma she ought to forbid me to go.Mamma said，‘Will you pay any attention if I forbid you to go?'‘No, darling，'I said，‘none.'Then she said，‘That is what I imagined.In that case there doesn't seem to be much point in my forbidding it.’”

“Your mother appears to be a woman of enormous sense.”

“I don't believe she misses much. When Larry called for me I went into her room to say good night to her.I'd made up a bit；you know, you have to in Paris or else you look so naked, and when she saw the dress I had on, I had an uneasy suspicion from the way she took me in from top to toe that she had a pretty shrewd idea what I was after.But she didn't say anything.She just kissed me and said she hoped I'd have a good time.”

“What were you after?”

Isabel looked at me doubtfully, as though she couldn't quite decide how frank she was prepared to be.

“I didn't think I was looking too bad and it was my last chance. Larry had reserved a table at Maxim's.We had lovely things to eat, all the things I particularly liked, and we had champagne.We talked our heads off, at least I did, and I made Larry laugh.One of the things I've liked about him is that I can always amuse him.We danced.When we'd had enough of that we went on to the Château de Madrid.We found some people we knew and joined them and we had more champagne.Then we all went to the Acacia.Larry dances quite well, and we fit.The heat and the music and the wine-I was getting a bit light-headed.I felt absolutely reckless.I danced with my face against Larry’s and I knew he wanted me.God knows I wanted him.I had an idea.I suppose it had been at the back of my mind all the time.I thought I’d get him to come home with me and once I’d got him there, well, it was almost inevitable that the inevitable should happen.”

“Upon my word you couldn't put it more delicately.”

“My room was quite a way from Uncle Elliott's and Mamma's, so I knew there was no risk. When we were back in America I thought I'd write and say I was going to have a baby.He'd be obliged to come back and marry me, and when I'd got him home I didn’t believe it would be hard to keep him there, especially with Mamma ill.‘What a fool I am not to have thought of that before，’I said to myself.‘Of course that’ll settle everything.’When the music stopped I just stayed there in his arms.Then I said it was getting late and we had to take the train at noon, so we’d better go.We got into a taxi.I nestled close to him and he put his arms around me and kissed me.He kissed me, he kissed me-oh, it was heaven.It hardly seemed a moment before the taxi stopped at the door.Larry paid it.

“‘I shall walk home，'he said.

“The taxi rattled off and I put my arms round his neck.

“‘Won't you come up and have one last drink?'I said.

“‘Yes, if you like，'he said.

“He'd rung the bell and the door swung open. He switched on the light as we stepped in.I looked into his eyes.They were so trusting, so honest, so-so guileless；he so obviously hadn't the smallest idea that I was laying a trap for him；I felt I couldn't play him such a dirty trick.It was like taking candy off a child.D'you know what I did?I said，‘Oh well, perhaps you'd better not.Mamma’s not very well tonight and if she’s fallen asleep I don’t want to wake her up.Good night.’I put my face up for him to kiss and pushed him out of the door.That was the end of that.”

“Are you sorry?”I asked.

“I'm neither pleased nor sorry. I just couldn't help myself.It wasn't me that did what I did.It was just an impulse that took possession of me and acted for me.”She grinned.“I suppose you'd call it my better nature.”

“I suppose you would.”

“Then my better nature must take the consequences. I trust in the future it'll be more careful.”

That was in effect the end of our talk. It may be that it was some consolation to Isabel to have been able to speak to someone with entire freedom, but that was all the good I had been able to do her.Feeling I had been inadequate, I tried to say at least some small thing that would give her comfort.

“You know, when one's in love，”I said，“and things go all wrong, one's terribly unhappy and one thinks one won't ever get over it. But you'll be astounded to learn what the sea will do.”

“What do you mean?”she smiled.

“Well, love isn't a good sailor and it languishes on a sea voyage. You'll be surprised when you have the Atlantic between you and Larry to find how slight the pang is that before you sailed seemed intolerable.”

“Do you speak from experience?”

“From the experience of a stormy past. When I suffered from the pangs of unrequited love I immediately got on an ocean liner.”

The rain showed no sign of letting up, so we decided that Isabel could survive without seeing the noble pile of Hampton Court or even Queen Elizabeth's bed, and drove back to London. I saw her two or three times after that, but only when other people were present, and then, having had enough of London for a while, I set off for the Tyrol.





CHAPTER THREE


1


For ten years after this I saw neither Isabel nor Larry. I continued to see Elliott, and indeed, for a reason that I shall tell later, more frequently than before, and from time to time I learnt from him what was happening to Isabel.But of Larry he could tell me nothing.

“For all I know he's still living in Paris, but I'm not likely to run across him. We don't move in the same circles，”he added, not without complacency.“It's very sad that he should have gone so completely to seed.He comes of a very good family.I'm sure I could have made something of him if he’d put himself in my hands.Anyhow it was a lucky escape for Isabel.”

My circle of acquaintance was not so restricted as Elliott's and I knew a number of persons in Paris whom he would have thought eminently undesirable. On my brief but not infrequent sojourns I asked one or other of them whether he had run across Larry or had news of him；a few knew him casually, but none could claim any intimacy with him and I could find nobody to give me news of him.I went to the restaurant at which he habitually dined, but found he had not been there for a long time, and they thought he must have gone away.I never saw him at any of the cafés on the Boulevard du Montparnasse which people who live in the neighbourhood are apt to go to.

His intention, after Isabel left Paris, was to go to Greece, but this he abandoned. What he actually did he told me himself many years later, but I will relate it now because it is more convenient to place events as far as I can in chronological order.He stayed on in Paris during the summer and worked without a break till autumn was well advanced.

“I thought I needed a rest from books then，”he said，“I'd been working from eight to ten hours a day for two years. So I went to work in a coal mine.”

“You did what?”I cried.

He laughed at my astonishment.

“I thought it would do me good to spend a few months in manual labour. I had a notion it would give me an opportunity to sort my thoughts and come to terms with myself.”

I was silent. I wondered whether that was the only reason for this unexpected step or whether it was connected with Isabel's refusal to marry him.The fact was, I didn't know at all how deeply he loved her.Most people when they're in love invent every kind of reason to persuade themselves that it's only sensible to do what they want.I suppose that's why there are so many disastrous marriages.They are like those who put their affairs in the hands of someone they know to be a crook, but who happens to be an intimate friend because, unwilling to believe that a crook is a crook first and a friend afterwards, they are convinced that, however dishonest he may be with others, he won’t be so with them.Larry was strong enough to refuse to sacrifice for Isabel’s sake the life that he thought was the life for him, but it may be that to lose her was bitterer to endure than he had expected.It may be that like most of us he wanted to eat his cake and have it.

“Well, go on，”I said.

“I packed my books and my clothes in a couple of trunks and got the American Express to store them. Then I putan extra suit and some linen in a grip and started off.My Greek teacher had a sister who was married to the manager of a mine near Lens and he gave me a letter to him.D'you know Lens?”

“No.”

“It's in the North of France, not far from the Belgian border. I only spent a night there, at the station hotel, and next day I took a local to the place where the mine was.Ever been to a mining village?”

“In England.”

“Well, I suppose it's much the same. There's the mine and the manager's house, rows and rows of trim little two-storey houses, all alike, exactly alike, and it's so monotonous it makes your heart sink.There's a newish, ugly church and several bars.It was bleak and cold when I got there and a thin rain was falling.I went to the manager’s office and sent in my letter.He was a little, fat man with red cheeks and the look of a guy who enjoys his food.They were short of labour, a lot of miners had been killed in the war, and there were a good many Poles working there, two or three hundred, I should think.He asked me one or two questions, he didn’t much like my being an American, he seemed to think it rather fishy, but his brother-in-law’s letter spoke well of me and anyhow he was glad to have me.He wanted to give me a job on the surface, but I told him I wanted to work down below.He said I’d find it hard if I wasn’t used to it, but I told him I was prepared for that, so then he said I could be helper to a miner.That was boy’s work really, but there weren’t enough boys to go round.He was a nice fellow；he asked me if I’d done anything about finding a lodging, and when I told him I hadn’t he wrote an address on a piece of paper and said that if I went there the woman of the house would let me have a bed.She was the widow of a miner who’d been killed and her two sons were working in the mine.

“I took up my grip and went on my way. I found the house, and the door was opened for me by a tall, gaunt woman with greying hair and big, dark eyes.She had good features and she must have been nice-looking once.She wouldn't have been bad then in a haggard way except for two missing front teeth.She told me she hadn't a room, but there were two beds in a room she'd let to a Pole and I could have the other one.Her two sons had one of the upstairs rooms and she had the other.The room she showed me was on the ground floor and supposed, I imagined, to be the living-room；I should have liked a room to myself, but I thought I'd better not be fussy；and the drizzle had turned into a steady, light rain and I was wet already.I didn't want to go farther and get soaked to the skin.So I said that would suit me and I settled in.They used the kitchen as a living-room.It had a couple of rickety armchairs in it.There was a coal shed in the yard which was also the bathhouse.The two boys and the Pole had taken their lunch with them, but she said I could eat with her at midday.I sat in the kitchen afterwards smoking and while she went on with her work she told me all about herself and her family.The others came in at the end of their shift.The Pole first and then the two boys.The Pole passed through the kitchen, nodded to me with-out speaking when our landlady told him I was to share his room, took a great kettle off the hob and went off to wash himself in the shed.The two boys were tall good-looking fellows notwithstanding the grime on their faces, and seemed inclined to be friendly.They looked upon me as a freak because I was American.One of them was nineteen, off to his military service in a few months, and the other eighteen.

“The Pole came back and then they went to clean up. The Pole had one of those difficult Polish names, but they called him Kosti.He was a big fellow, two or three inches taller than me, and heavily built.He had a pale fleshy face with a broad short nose and a big mouth.His eyes were blue and because he hadn't been able to wash the coal dust off his eyebrows and eyelashes he looked as if he was made up.The black lashes made the blue of his eyes almost startling.He was an ugly, uncouth fellow.The two boys after they'd changed their clothes went out.The Pole sat on in the kitchen, smoking a pipe and reading the paper.I had a book in my pocket, so I took it out and began reading too.I noticed that he glanced at me once or twice and presently he put his paper down.

“‘What are you reading?'he asked.

“I handed him the book to see for himself. It was a copy of the Princesse de Clèves that I’d bought at the station in Paris because it was small enough to put in my pocket.He looked at it, then at me, curiously, and handed it back.I noticed an ironical smile on his lips.

“‘Does it amuse you?'

“‘I think it's very interesting-even absorbing.'

“‘I read it at school at Warsaw. It bored me stiff.'He spoke very good French, with hardly a trace of Polish accent.‘Now I don't read anything but the newspaper and detective stories.'

“Madame Leclerc, that was our old girl's name, with an eye on the soup that was cooking for supper, sat at the table darning socks. She told Kosti that I had been sent to her by the manager of the mine and repeated what else I had seen fit to tell her.He listened, puffing away at his pipe, and looked at me with brilliantly blue eyes.They were hard and shrewd.He asked me a few questions about myself.When I told him I had never worked in a mine before his lips broke again into an ironical smile.

“‘You don't know what you're in for. No one would go to work in a mine who could do anything else.But that's your affair and doubtless you have your reasons.Where did you live in Paris?'

“I told him.

“‘At one time I used to go to Paris every year, but I kept to the Grands Boulevards. Have you ever been to Larue's?It was my favourite restaurant.'

“That surprised me a bit because, you know, it's not cheap.”

“Far from it.”

“I fancy he saw my surprise, for he gave me once more his mocking smile, but evidently didn't think it necessary to explain further. We went on talking in a desultory fashion and then the two boys came in.We had supper and when we'd finished Kosti asked me if I'd like to come to the bistro with him and have a beer.It was just a rather large room with a bar at one end of it and a number of marble-topped tables with wooden chairs around them.There was a mechanical piano and someone had put a coin in the slot and it was braying out a dance tune.Only three tables were occupied besides ours.Kosti asked me if I played belote.I'd learnt it with some of my student friends, so I said I did and he proposed that we should play for the beer.I agreed and he called for cards.I lost a beer and a second beer.Then he proposed that we should play for money.He had good cards and I had bad luck.We were playing for very small stakes, but I lost several francs.This and the beer put him in a good humour and he talked.It didn't take me long to guess both by his way of expressing himself and by his manners, that he was a man of education.When he spoke again of Paris it was to ask me if I knew So-and-so and So-and-so, American women I had met at Elliott’s when Aunt Louisa and Isabel were staying with him.He appeared to know them better than I did and I wondered how it was that he found himself in his present position.It wasn’t late, but we had to get up at the crack of dawn.

“‘Let's have one more beer before we go，'said Kosti.

“He sipped it and peered at me with his shrewd little eyes. I knew what he reminded me of then, an ill-tempered pig.

“‘Why have you come here to work in this rotten mine?'he asked me.

“‘For the experience.'

“‘Tu es fou, mon petit，'he said.

“‘And why are you working in it?'

“He shrugged his massive, ungainly shoulders.

“‘I entered the nobleman's cadet school when I was a kid, my father was a general under the Czar and I was a cavalry officer in the last war. I couldn't stand Pilsudski.We arranged to kill him, but someone gave us away.He shot those of us he caught.I managed to get across the frontier just in time.There was nothing for me but the Foreign Legion or a coal mine.I chose the lesser of two evils.'

“I had already told Kosti what job I was to have in the mine and he had said nothing, but now, putting his elbow on the marble-topped table, he said：

“‘Try to push my hand back.'

“I knew the old trial of strength and I put my open palm against his. He laughed.‘Your hand won't be as soft asthat in a few weeks.'I pushed with all my might, but I could make no effect against his huge strength and gradually he pressed my hand back and down to the table.

“‘You're pretty strong，'he was good enough to say.‘There aren't many men who keep up as long as that. Listen, my helper's no good, he's a puny little Frenchman, he hasn’t got the strength of a louse.You come along with me tomorrow and I’ll get the foreman to let me have you instead.’

“‘I'd like that，'I said.‘D'you think he'll do it?'

“‘For a consideration. Have you got fifty francs to spare?'

“He stretched out his hand and I took a note out of my wallet. We went home and to bed.I'd had a long day and I slept like a log.”

“Didn't you find the work terribly hard?”I asked Larry.

“Back-breaking at first，”he grinned.“Kosti worked it with the foreman and I was made his helper. At that time Kosti was working in a space about the size of a hotel bathroom and one got to it through a tunnel so low that you had to crawl through it on your hands and knees.It was as hot as hell in there and we worked in nothing but our pants.There was something terribly repulsive in that great white fat torso of Kosti's；he looked like a huge slug.The row of the pneumatic cutter in that narrow space was deafening.My job was to gather the blocks of coal that he hacked away and load a basket with them and drag the basket through the tunnel to its mouth, where it could be loaded into a truck when the train came along at intervals on its way to the elevators.It's the only coal mine I've ever known, so I don't know if that's the normal practice.It seemed amateurish to me and it was damned hard work.At half time we knocked off for a rest and ate our lunch and smoked.I wasn’t sorry when we were through for the day, and gosh, it was good to have a bath.I thought I’d never get my feet clean；they were as black as ink.Of course my hands blistered and they got as sore as the devil, but they healed.I got used to the work.”

“How long did you stick it out?”

“I was only kept on that job for a few weeks. The trucks that carried the coal to the elevators were hauled by a tractor and the driver was a poor mechanic and the engine was always breaking down.Once he couldn't get it going and he didn't seem to know what to do.Well, I'm a pretty good mechanic, so I had a look at it and in half an hour I got it working.The foreman told the manager and he sent for me and asked me if I knew about cars.The result was that he gave me the mechanic's job；of course it was monotonous, but it was easy, and because they didn't have any more engine trouble they were pleased with me.

“Kosti was as sore as hell at my leaving him. I suited him and he'd got used to me.I got to know him pretty well, working with him all day, going to the bistro with him after supper, and sharing a room with him.He was a funny fellow.He was the sort of man who'd have appealed to you.He didn't mix with the Poles and we didn't go to the cafés they went to.He couldn’t forget he was a nobleman and had been a cavalry officer and he treated them like dirt.Naturally they resented it, but they couldn’t do anything about it；he was as strong as an ox, and if it had ever come to a scrap, knives or no knives, he’d have been a match for half a dozen of them together.I got to know some of them all the same, and they told me he’d been a cavalry officer all right in one of the smart regiments, but it was a lie about his having left Poland for political reasons.He’d been kicked out of the Officers’Club at Warsaw and cashiered because he’d been caught cheating at cards.They warned me against playing with him.They said that was why he fought shy of them, because they knew too much about him and wouldn’t play with him.

“I'd been losing to him consistently, not much, you know, just a few francs a night, but when he won he always insisted on paying for drinks, so it didn't amount to anything really. I thought I was just having a run of bad luck or that I didn't play as well as he did.But after that I kept my eyes skinned and I was dead sure he was cheating, but d'you know, for the life of me I couldn't see how he did it.Gosh, he was clever.I knew he simply couldn’t have the best cards all the time.I watched him like a lynx.He was as cunning as a fox and I guess he saw I’d been put wise to him.One night, after we’d been playing for a while, he looked at me with that rather cruel, sarcastic smile of his which was the only way he knew how to smile, and said：

“‘Shall I show you a few tricks?'

“He took the pack of cards and asked me to name one. He shuffled them and he told me to choose one；I did, and it was the card I'd named.He did two or three more tricks and then he asked me if I played poker.I said I did and he dealt me a hand.When I looked at it I saw I'd got four aces and a king.

“‘You'd be willing to bet a good deal on that hand, wouldn't you?'he asked.

“‘My whole stack，'I answered.

“‘You'd be silly.'He put down the hand he'd dealt himself. It was a straight flush.How it was done I don't know.He laughed at my amazement.‘If I weren't an honest man I’d have had your shirt by now.’

“‘You haven't done so badly as it is，'I grinned.

“‘Chicken feed. Not enough to buy a dinner at Larue's.'

“We continued to play pretty well every night. I came to the conclusion that he cheated not so much for the money as for the fun of it.It gave him a queer satisfaction to know that he was making a fool of me, and I think he got a lot of amusement out of knowing that I was on to what he was doing and couldn't see how it was done.

“But that was only one side of him and it was the other side that made him so interesting to me. I couldn't reconcile the two.Though he boasted he never read anything but the paper and detective stories he was a cultivated man.He was a good talker, caustic, harsh, cynical, but it was exhilarating to listen to him.He was a devout Catholic and had a crucifix hanging over his bed, and he went to Mass every Sunday regularly.On Saturday nights he used to get drunk.The bistro we went to was crammed jammed full then, and the air was heavy with smoke.There were quiet, middle-aged miners with their families, and there were groups of young fellows kicking up a hell of a row, and there were men with sweaty faces round tables playing belote with loud shouts, while their wives sat by, a little behind them, and watched.The crowd and the noise had a strange effect on Kosti and he'd grow serious and start talking-of all unlikely subjects-of mysticism.I knew nothing of it then but an essay of Maeterlinck's on Ruysbroek that I'd read in Paris.But Kosti talked of Plotinus and Denis the Areopagite and Jacob Boehme the shoemaker and Meister Eckhart.It was fantastic to hear that great hulking bum, who'd been thrown out of his own world, that sardonic, bitter down-and-out, speaking of the ultimate reality of things and the blessedness of union with God.It was all new to me and I was confused and excited.I was like someone who’s lain awake in a darkened room and suddenly a chink of light shoots through the curtains and he knows he only has to draw them and there the country will be spread before him in the glory of the dawn.But if I tried to get him on the subject when he was sober he got mad at me.His eyes were spiteful.

“‘How should I know what I was talking about when I didn't know what I was saying?'he snapped.

“But I knew he was lying. He knew perfectly well what he was talking about.He knew a lot.Of course he was soused, but the look in his eyes, the rapt expression on his ugly face, weren't due only to drink.There was more to it than that.The first time he talked in that way he said something that I've never forgotten, because it horrified me；he said that the world isn't a creation, for out of nothing nothing comes；but a manifestation of the eternal nature；well, that was all right, but then he added that evil is as direct a manifestation of the divine as good.They were strange words to hear in that sordid, noisy café，to the accompaniment of dance tunes on the mechanical piano.”

To give the reader a moment's rest I am starting here upon a new section, but I am doing it only for his convenience；the conversation was uninterrupted. I may take this opportunity to say that Larry spoke without haste, often choosing his words with care, and though of course I do not pretend to report them exactly, I have tried to reproduce not only the matter, but the manner of his discourse.His voice, rich in tone, had a musical quality that was grateful to the ear；and as he talked without gesticulation of any kind, puffing away at his pipe and stopping now and again to relight it, he looked you in the face with a pleasant, often whimsical expression in his dark eyes.

“Then the spring came, late in that flat, dismal part of the country, cold and rainy still；but sometimes a fine warm day made it hard to leave the world above ground and go down hundreds of feet in a rickety elevator, crowded with miners in their grimy overalls, into the bowels of the earth. It was spring all right, but it seemed to come shyly in that grim and sordid landscape as though unsure of a welcome.It was like a flower, a daffodil or a lily, growing in a pot on the window-sill of a slum dwelling and you wondered what it did there.One Sunday morning we were lying in bed, we always slept late on Sunday morning, and I was reading, when Kosti said to me out of a blue sky：

“‘I'm getting out of here. D'you want to come with me?'

“I knew a lot of the Poles went back to Poland in the summer to get the harvest in, but it was early for that, and besides, Kosti couldn't go back to Poland.

“‘Where are you going?'I asked.

“‘Tramping. Across Belgium and into Germany and down the Rhine.We could get work on a farm that would see us through the summer.'

“It didn't take a minute to make up my mind.

“‘It sounds fine，'I said.

“Next day we told the foreman we were through. I found a fellow who was willing to take my grip in exchange for a rucksack.I gave the clothes I didn't want or couldn't carry on my back to the younger of Madame Leclerc's sons who was about my size.Kosti left a bag, packed what he wanted in his rucksack and the day after, as soon as the old girl had given us our coffee, we started off.

“We weren't in any hurry as we knew we couldn't get taken on at a farm at least until the hay was ready to cut, and so we dawdled along through France and Belgium by way of Namur and Liège and got into Germany through Aachen.We didn’t do more than ten or twelve miles a day.When we liked the look of a village we stopped there.There was always some kind of an inn where we could get beds and an alehouse where we could get something to eat and beer to drink.On the whole we had fine weather.It was grand to be out in the open air after all those months in the mine.I don’t think I’d ever realized before how good a green meadow is to look at and how lovely a tree is when the leaves aren’t out yet, but the branches are veiled in a faint green mist.Kosti started to teach me German and I believe he spoke it as well as he spoke French.As we trudged along he would tell me the German for the various objects we passed, a cow, a horse, a man and so on, and then repeat simple German sentences.It made the time pass and by the time we got into Germany I could at least ask for the things I wanted.

“Cologne was a bit out of our way, but Kosti insisted on going there, on account of the Eleven Thousand Virgins, he said, and when we got there he went on a bat. I didn't see him for three days and when he turned up at the room we'd taken in a sort of workmen's rooming-house he was very surly.He'd got in a fight and he had a black eye and a cut on his lip.He wasn't a pretty object, I can tell you.He went to bed for twenty-four hours, and then we started to walk down the valley of the Rhine towards Darmstadt, where he said the country was good and we stood the best chance of getting work.

“I never enjoyed anything more. The fine weather held and we wandered through towns and villages.When there were sights to see we stopped off and looked at them.We put up where we could and once or twice we slept in a loft on the hay.We ate at wayside inns, and when we got in the wine country we turned from beer to wine.We made friends with the people in the taverns we drank in.Kosti had a sort of rough joviality that inspired them with confidence and he'd play skat with them, that's a German card game, and skin them with such bluff good humour, with the earthy jokes they appreciated, that they hardly minded losing their pfennigs to him.I practised my German on them.I'd bought a little English-German conversation grammar at Cologne and I was getting on pretty well.And then at night, when he'd got a couple of litres of white wine inside him, Kosti would talk in a morbid way of the flight from the Alone to the Alone, of the Dark Night of the Soul and of the final ecstasy in which the creature becomes one with the Beloved.But when in the early morning, as we walked through the smiling country, with the dew still on the grass, I tried to get him to tell me more, he grew so angry that he could have hit me.

“‘Shut up, you fool，'he said.‘What do you want with all that stuff and nonsense?Come, let's get on with our German.'

“You can't argue with a man who's got a fist like a steam hammer and wouldn't think twice about using it. I'd seen him in a rage.I knew he was capable of laying me out cold and leaving me in a ditch and I wouldn't have put it past him to empty my pockets while I was out.I couldn’t make head or tail of him.When wine had loosened his tongue and he spoke of the Ineffable, he shed the rough obscene language that he ordinarily used, like the grimy overalls he wore in the mine, and he was well-spoken and even eloquent.I couldn’t believe he wasn’t sincere.I don’t know how it occurred to me, but I got the idea somehow that he’d taken on that hard, brutal labour of the mine to mortify his flesh.I thought he hated that great, uncouth body of his and wanted to torture it, and that his cheating and his bitterness and his cruelty were the revolt of his will against-oh, I don’t know what you’d call it-against a deep-rooted instinct of holiness, against a desire for God that terrified and yet obsessed him.

“We'd taken our time, the spring was pretty well over and the trees were in full leaf. The grapes in the vineyards were beginning to fill out.We kept to the dirt roads as much as we could and they were getting dusty.We were in the neighbourhood of Darmstadt, and Kosti said we'd better start looking for a job.Our money was getting short.I had half a dozen travellers'cheques in my pocket, but I'd made up my mind not to use them if I could possibly help it.When we saw a farmhouse that looked promising we stopped and asked if they wanted a couple of hands, I dare say we didn't look very inviting.We were dusty and sweaty and dirty.Kosti looked a terrible ruffian and I don’t suppose I looked much better either.We were turned down time after time.At one place the farmer said he’d take Kosti but couldn’t do with me and Kosti said we were buddies and wouldn’t separate.I told him to go ahead, but he wouldn’t.I was surprised.I knew Kosti had taken a fancy to me, though I couldn’t imagine why, as I didn’t begin to be the kind of guy he had any use for, but I would never have thought he liked me well enough to refuse a job on my account.I felt rather conscience-stricken as we walked on, because I didn’t really like him, in fact I found him rather repulsive, but when I tried to say something to show I was pleased with what he’d done, he bit my head off.

“But at last our luck turned. We'd just gone through a village in a hollow and we came to a rambling farmhouse that didn't look so bad.We knocked at the door and a woman opened it.We offered ourselves as usual.We said we didn't want any wages, but were willing to work for our board and lodging, and to my surprise instead of slamming the door in our face, she told us to wait.She called to someone inside the house and presently a man came out.He had a good stare at us and asked us where we came from.He asked to see our papers.He gave me another stare when he saw I was American.He didn't seem to like it very much, but anyhow he asked us to come in and have a glass of wine.He took us into the kitchen and we sat down.The woman brought a flagon and some glasses.He told us that his hired man had been gored by a bull and was in hospital and wouldn't be fit for anything till after the harvest was in.With so many men killed, and others going into the factories that were springing up along the Rhine, it was the devil’s own job to get labour.We knew that and had been counting on it.Well, to make a long story short he said he’d take us.There was plenty of room in the house, but I suppose he didn’t fancy having us there；anyway he told us there were two beds in the hayloft and that was where we were to sleep.

“The work wasn't hard. There were the cows to look after and the hogs；the machinery was in a bad way, and we had to do something about that；but I had some leisure.I loved the sweet-smelling meadows and in the evenings I used to wander about and dream.It was a good life.

“The household consisted of old Becker, his wife, his widowed daughter-in-law and her children. Becker was a heavy, grey-haired man in his late forties；he'd been through the war and still limped from a wound in the leg.It hurt him a lot and he drank to kill the pain.He was generally high by the time he got to bed.Kosti got on with him fine and they used to go down to the inn together after supper to play skat and swill wine.Frau Becker had been a hired girl.They'd got her out of an orphanage and Becker had married her soon after his wife's death.She was a good many years younger than he was, rather handsome in a way, full-blown, with red cheeks and fair hair and a hungry sensual look.It didn't take Kosti long to come to the conclusion that there was something doing there.I told him not to be a fool.Wehad a good job and we didn't want to lose it.He only jeered at me；he said Becker wasn’t satisfying her and she was asking for it.I knew it was useless to appeal to his sense of decency, but I told him to be careful；it might be that Becker wouldn’t see what he was after, but there was his daughter-in-law, and she wasn’t missing anything.

“Ellie, that was her name, was a thickset, big young woman, well under thirty, with black eyes and black hair, a sallow square face and a sullen look. She still wore mourning for her husband killed at Verdun.She was very devout and on Sunday mornings trudged down to the village to early Mass and again in the afternoon to vespers.She had three children, one of whom had been born after her husband's death, and she never spoke at meals except to scold them.She did little work on the farm, but spent most of her time looking after the kids, and in the evening sat by herself in the sitting-room, with the door open so that she could hear if one of them was crying, and read novels.The two women hated one another.Ellie despised Frau Becker because she was a foundling and had been a servant, and bitterly resented her being the mistress of the house and in a position to give orders.

“Ellie was the daughter of a prosperous farmer and had brought a good dowry with her. She hadn't gone to the village school, but to Zwingenberg, the nearest town, where there was a girl's gymnasium, and she'd got quite a good education.Poor Frau Becker had come to the farm when she was fourteen and if she could read and write that's about all she could do.That was another cause of discord between the two women.Ellie lost no opportunity of showing off her knowledge, and Frau Becker, red in the face with anger, would ask what use it was to a farmer's wife.Then Ellie would look at her husband’s identification disc which she wore on a steel chain round her wrist and with a bitter look on her sullen face say：

“‘Not a farmer's wife. Only a farmer's widow.Only the widow of a hero who gave his life for his country.'

“Poor old Becker had his work cut out to keep the peace between them.”

“But what did they make of you?”I interrupted Larry.

“Oh, they thought I'd deserted from the American Army and couldn't go back to America or I'd be put in jail. That's how they explained that I didn't care to go down to the inn and drink with Becker and Kosti.They thought I didn’t want to attract attention to myself and have the village constable asking questions.When Ellie found out I was trying to learn German she brought out her old schoolbooks and said she’d teach me.So after supper she and I would go into the sitting-room, leaving Frau Becker in the kitchen, and I’d read aloud to her while she corrected my accent and tried to make me understand words I couldn’t get the sense of.I guessed she was doing it not so much to help me as to put something over on Frau Becker.

“All this time Kosti was trying to make Frau Becker and wasn't getting anywhere. She was a jolly, merry woman and quite prepared to joke and laugh with him, and he had a way with him with women.I guess she knew what he was after and I dare say she was flattered, but when he started pinching her she told him to keep his hands to himself and smacked his face.And I bet it was a good hard smack.”

Larry hesitated a little and smiled rather shyly.

“I've never been the sort who thinks women are after me, but it occurred to me that-well, that Frau Becker had fallen for me. It made me rather uncomfortable.For one thing she was a lot older than me, and then old Becker had been very decent to us.She dished out the food at table and I couldn't help noticing that she helped me more liberally than the others, and she seemed to me to look for opportunities of being alone with me.She'd smile at me in what I suppose you'd call a provocative manner.She'd ask me if I had a girl, and say that a young fellow like me must suffer for the want of it in a place like that.You know the sort of thing.I only had three shirts and they were pretty well worn.Once she said it was a disgrace that I should wear such rags and if I’d bring them along she’d mend them.Ellie heard her and next time we were alone said that if I had anything to mend she’d do it.I said it didn’t matter.But a day or two later I found that my socks had been darned and my shirts patched and put back on the bench in the loft on which we kept our things；but which of them had done it I don’t know.Of course I didn’t take Frau Becker seriously；she was a good-natured old soul and I thought it might be just motherliness on her part；but then one day Kosti said to me：

“‘Listen, it's not me she wants；it's you. I haven't got a chance.'

“‘Don't talk such nonsense，'I said to him.‘She's old enough to be my mother.'

“‘What of it?You go ahead, my boy, I won't stand in your way. She's not so young as she might be, but she's a fine figure of a woman.'

“‘Oh, shut up.'

“‘Why d'you hesitate?Not on my account, I hope. I'm a philosopher and I know there are as good fish in the sea as ever came out.I don't blame her.You're young.I've been young too.Jeunesse ne dure qu’un moment.’

“I wasn't too pleased that Kosti was so sure of what I didn't want to believe. I didn't quite know how to deal with the situation, and then I recalled various things that hadn't struck me at the time.Things said by Ellie that I hadn't paid much attention to.But now I understood them and I was pretty sure that she too knew what was happening.She’d turn up suddenly in the kitchen when Frau Becker and I happened to be alone.I got the impression that she was watching us.I didn’t like it.I thought she was out to catch us.I knew she hated Frau Becker, and if she had half a chance she’d make trouble.Of course I knew she couldn’t catch us, but she was a malevolent creature and I didn’t know what lies she mightn’t invent and pour into old Becker’s ears.I didn’t know what to do except to pretend I was such a fool I didn’t see what the old girl was up to.I was happy at the farm and enjoying the work and I didn’t want to go till after we’d got the harvest in.”

I couldn't help smiling. I could imagine what Larry had looked like then, in his patched shirt and shorts, his face and neck burnt brown by the hot sun of the Rhine valley, with his lithe slim body, and his black eyes in their deep sockets.I could well believe that the sight of him set the matronly Frau Becker, so blonde, so full-breasted, all of a flutter with desire.

“Well, what happened?”I asked.

“Well, the summer wore on. We worked like demons there.We cut and stacked the hay.Then the cherries were ripe, Kosti and I got up on ladders and picked them, and the two women put them in great baskets and old Becker took them into Zwingenberg and sold them.Then we cut the rye.And of course there were always the animals to look after.We were up before dawn and we didn't stop work till nightfall.I supposed Frau Becker had given me up as a bad job；as far as I could without offending her, I kept her at arm's length.I was too sleepy to read much German in the evenings and soon after supper I'd take myself off to our loft and fall into bed.Most evenings Becker and Kosti went to the inn down in the village, but I was fast asleep by the time Kosti came back.It was hot in the loft and I slept naked.

“One night I was awakened. At the first moment I couldn't make out what it was；I was only half awake.I felt a hot hand on my mouth and I realized somebody was in bed with me, I tore the hand away and then a mouth was pressed to mine, two arms were thrown round me, and I felt Frau Becker's great breasts against my body.

“‘Sei still，'she whispered.‘Be quiet.'

“She pressed up against me and kissed my face with hot full lips and her hands travelled over my body and she twined her legs in mine.”

Larry stopped. I giggled.

“What did you do?”

He gave me a deprecating smile. He even flushed a little.

“What could I do?I could hear Kosti breathing heavily in his sleep in the bed next to mine. The situation of Joseph has always seemed to me faintly ridiculous.I was only just twenty-three.I couldn't make a scene and kick her out.I didn't want to hurt her feelings.I did what was expected of me.

“Then she slipped out of bed and tiptoed out of the loft. I can tell you, I heaved a sigh of relief.You know, I'd been scared.‘Gosh，'I said，‘what a risk to take！'I thought it likely that Becker had come home drunk and fallen asleep in a stupor, but they slept in the same bed, and it might be that he'd woken up and seen his wife wasn't there.And there was Ellie.She always said she didn’t sleep well.If she’d been awake she’d have heard Frau Becker go downstairs and out of the house.And then, suddenly, something struck me.When Frau Becker was in bed with me I’d felt a piece of metal against my skin.I’d paid no attention, you know one doesn’t in those circumstances, and I’d never thought of askingmyself what the devil it was.And now it flashed across me.I was sitting on the side of my bed thinking and worrying about the consequences of all this and it was such a shock that I jumped up.The piece of metal was Ellie’s husband’s identification disc that she wore round her wrist and it wasn’t Frau Becker that had been in bed with me.It was Ellie.”

I roared with laughter. I couldn't stop.

“It may seem funny to you，”said Larry.“It didn't seem funny to me.”

“Well, now you look back on it, don't you think there is just a faint element of the humorous about it?”

An unwilling smile played on his lips.

“Perhaps. But it was an awkward situation.I didn't know what it was going to lead to.I didn't like Ellie.I thought her a most unpleasant female.”

“But how could you mistake one for the other?”

“It was pitch dark. She never said a word except to tell me to keep my trap shut.They were both big stout women.I thought Frau Becker had her eye on me.It never occurred to me for a moment that Ellie gave me a thought.She was always thinking of her husband.I lit a cigarette and thought the position over and the more I thought of it the less I liked it.It seemed to me that the best thing I could do was to get out.

“I'd often cursed Kosti because he was so hard to wake. When we were at the mine I used to have to shake the life out of him to get him up in time to go to work.But I was thankful now that he slept so heavily.I lit my lantern and dressed, bundled my things into my rucksack-I hadn't got much, so it didn't take a minute-and slipped my arms through the straps.I walked across the loft in my stocking feet and didn't put my shoes on till I got to the bottom of the ladder.I blew out the lantern.It was a dark night, with no moon, but I knew my way to the road and I turned in the direction of the village.I walked fast as I wanted to get through it before anyone was up and about.It was only twelve miles to Zwingenberg and I got there just as it was stirring.I shall never forget that walk.There wasn't a sound except my footsteps on the road and now and then the crowing of a cock in a farm.Then the first greyness when it wasn’t yet light and not quite dark, and the first hint of dawn, and the sunrise with the birds all starting to sing, and that lush green country, meadows and woods and the wheat in the fields silvery gold in the cool light of the beginning day.I got a cup of coffee at Zwingenberg and a roll, then I went to the post office and sent a wire to the American Express to have my clothes and my books sent to Bonn.”

“Why Bonn?”I interrupted.

“I'd taken a fancy to it when we stopped off there on our tramp down the Rhine. I liked the way the light shone on the roofs and the river, and its old narrow streets, and its villas and gardens and avenues of chestnut trees and the rococo buildings of the university.It struck me then it wouldn't be a bad place to stay in for a bit.But I thought I'd better present a respectable appearance when I got there, I looked like a tramp and I didn't think I'd inspire much confidence if I went to a pension and asked for a room, so I took a train to Frankfurt and bought myself a grip and a few clothes.I stayed in Bonn off and on for a year.”

“And did you get anything out of your experience, at the mine, I mean, and on the farm?”

“Yes，”said Larry, nodding his head and smiling.

But he didn't tell me what it was and I knew him well enough by then to know that when he felt like telling you something he did, but when he didn't he would turn off questions with a cool pleasantry that made it useless to insist. For I must remind the reader that he narrated all this to me ten years after it happened.Till then, when I once more came in contact with him, I had no notion where he was or how he was engaged.For all I knew he might be dead.Except for my friendship with Elliott, who kept me posted with the course of Isabel's life and so reminded me of Larry, I should doubtless have forgotten his existence.





3


Isabel was married to Gray Maturin early in the June of the year after the termination of her engagement to Larry. Though Elliott hated leaving Paris at a moment when the season was at its height and he must miss a number of grand parties, his family feeling was too strong to allow him to neglect what he thought a social duty.Isabel's brothers were unable to leave their distant posts and so it behoved him to make the irksome journey to Chicago to give his niece away.Remembering that French aristocrats had gone to the guillotine in all their finery, he made a special journey to London to get himself a new morning coat, a dove-grey double-breasted waistcoat, and a silk hat.On his return to Paris he invited me to come and see them on.He was in a state of perturbation because the grey pearl he usually wore in his necktie would not make any sort of effect against the pale grey tie he had chosen as suitable to the festive occasion.I suggested his emerald-and-diamond pin.

“If I were a guest-yes，”he said.“But in the particular position I shall occupy I feel that a pearl is indicated.”

He was much pleased with the marriage, which concorded with all his ideas of propriety, and he spoke of it with the unctuousness of a dowager duchess expressing herself on the suitability of a union between a scion of the La Rochefoucaulds with a daughter of the Montmorencys. As a visible mark of his satisfaction he was taking over as a wedding present, sparing no expense, a fine portrait by Nattier of a princess of the House of France.

It appeared that Henry Maturin had bought for the young couple a house in Astor Street so that they should be close to where Mrs. Bradley lived and not too far from his own palatial residence on Lake Shore Drive.By a happy chance, in which I suspected the deft complicity of Elliott, Gregory Brabazon was in Chicago at the time the purchase was made and the decoration was entrusted to him.When Elliott returned to Europe and, throwing in his hand so far as the season in Paris was concerned, came straight to London, he brought photographs of the result.Gregory Brabazon had let himself go.In the drawing-room he had gone all George the Second and it was very grand.In the library, which was to be Gray's den, he had been inspired by a room in the Amalienburg Palace at Munich, and except that there was no place in it for books it was perfect.Save for the twin beds, Louis Quinze visiting Madame de Pompadour would have found himself perfectly at home in the bedroom Gregory had provided for this young American couple, but Isabel's bathroom would have been an eye-opener to him；it was all glass-walls, ceiling and bath-and on the walls silver fish meandered profusely among gilded aquatic plants.

“Of course it's a tiny house，”said Elliott，“but Henry told me the decoration set him back a hundred thousand dollars. A fortune to some people.”

The ceremony was performed with such pomp as the Episcopalian church could afford.

“Not like a wedding at Notre Dame，”he told me complacently，“but for a Protestant affair it didn't lack style.”

The press had behaved very handsomely and Elliott negligently tossed the cuttings to me. He showed me photographs of Isabel, hefty but handsome in her wedding-dress, and Gray, a massive but fine figure of a man, a trifle self-conscious in his formal clothes.There was a group of the young couple with bridesmaids and another group with Mrs.Bradley in a sumptuous garment and Elliott holding his new top-hat with a grace that only he could have achieved.I asked how Mrs.Bradley was.

“She's lost a good deal of weight and I don't like her colour, but she's pretty well. Of course the whole thing was a strain on her, but now it's all over she'll be able to rest up.”

A year later Isabel was delivered of a daughter, to whom, following the fashion of the moment, she gave the name of Joan；and after an interval of two years she had another daughter whom, following another fashion, she called Priscilla.

One of Henry Maturin's partners died and the other two under pressure soon afterwards retired, so that he entered into sole possession of the business over which he had always exercised despotic control. He realized the ambition he had long entertained and took Gray into partnership with him.The firm had never been so prosperous.

“They're making money hand over fist, my dear fellow，”Elliott told me.“Why, Gray at the age of twenty-five is making fifty thousand a year, and that's only a beginning. The resources of America are inexhaustible.It isn't a boom, it's just the natural development of a great country.”

His chest swelled with an unwonted patriotic fervour.

“Henry Maturin can't live for ever, high blood pressure, you know, and by the time Gray's forty he should be worth twenty million dollars. Princely, my dear fellow, princely.”

Elliott kept up a fairly regular correspondence with his sister and from time to time as the years went on passed on to me what she told him. Gray and Isabel were very happy, and the babies were sweet.They lived in a style that Elliott gladly admitted was eminently suitable；they entertained lavishly and were lavishly entertained；he told me with satisfaction that Isabel and Gray hadn't dined by themselves once in three months.Their whirl of gaiety was interrupted by the death of Mrs.Maturin, that colourless, highborn lady whom Henry Maturin had married for her connexions when he was making a place for himself in the city to which his father had come as a country bumpkin；and out of respect for her memory for a year the young couple never entertained more than six people to dinner.

“I've always said that eight was the perfect number，”said Elliott, determined to look on the bright side of things.“It's intimate enough to permit of general conversation and yet large enough to give the impression of a party.”

Gray was wonderfully generous to his wife. On the birth of their first child he gave her a square-cut diamond ring and on the birth of her second a sable coat.He was too busy to leave Chicago much, but such holidays as he could take they spent at Henry Maturin's imposing house at Marvin.Henry could deny nothing to the son whom he adored and one Christmas gave him a plantation in South Carolina so that he could get a fortnight's duck-shooting in the season.

“Of course our merchant princes correspond to those great patrons of the arts of the Italian Renaissance who made fortunes by commerce. The Medici, for instance.Two kings of France were not too proud to marry the daughters of that illustrious family and I foresee the day when the crowned heads of Europe will seek the hands of our dollar princesses.What was it Shelley said?‘The world's great age begins anew, the golden years return.'”

Henry Maturin had for many years looked after Mrs. Bradley's and Elliott's investments and they had a well-justified confidence in his acumen.He had never countenanced speculation and had put their money into sound securities, but with the great increase in values they found their comparatively modest fortunes increased in a manner that both surprised and delighted them.Elliott told me that, without stirring a finger, he was nearly twice as rich in 1926 as he had been in 1918.He was sixty-five, his hair was grey, his face lined, and there were pouches under his eyes, but he bore his years gallantly；he was as slim and held himself as erectly as ever；he had always been moderate in his habits and taken care of his appearance.He had no intention of submitting to the ravages of time so long as he could have his clothes made by the best tailor in London, his hair dressed and his face shaved by his own particular barber, and a masseur to come in every morning to keep his elegant body in perfect condition.He had long forgotten that he had ever so far demeaned himself as to engage in a trade, and without ever saying so outright, for he was not so stupid as to tell a lie that might be found out, he was inclined to suggest that in his youth he had been in the diplomatic service.I must admit that if I had ever had occasion to draw a portrait of an ambassador I should without hesitation have chosen Elliott as my model.

But things were changing. Such of the great ladies who had advanced Elliott's career as were still alive were well along in years.The English peeresses, having lost their lords, had been forced to surrender their mansions to daughters-in-law, and had retired to villas at Cheltenham or to modest houses in Regent's Park.Stafford House was turned into a museum, Curzon House became the seat of an organization, Devonshire House was for sale.The yacht on which Elliott had been in the habit of staying at Cowes had passed into other hands.The fashionable persons who occupied the stage had no use for the elderly man that Elliott now was.They found him tiresome and ridiculous.They were still willing to come to his elaborate luncheon parties at Claridge's but he was quick-witted enough to know that they came to meet one another rather than to see him.He could no longer pick and choose among the invitations that once had littered his writing-table, and much more often than he would have liked anyone to know he suffered the humiliation of dining by himself in the privacy of his suite.Women of rank in England, when a scandal has closed the doors of society to them, develop an interest in the arts and surround themselves with painters, writers and musicians.Elliott was too proud thus to humiliate himself.

“The death duties and the war profiteers have ruined English society，”he told me.“People don't seem to mind whothey know. London still has its tailors, its bootmakers, and its hatters, and I trust they'll last my time, but except for them it's finished.My dear fellow, do you know that the St.Erth's have women to wait at table?”

This he said when we were walking away from Carlton House Terrace after a luncheon party at which an unfortunate incident had occurred. Our noble host had a well-known collection of pictures, and a young American who was there, Paul Barton by name, expressed a desire to see them.

“You've got a Titian, haven't you?”

“We had. It's in America now.Some old Jew offered us a packet of money for it and we were damned hard up at the time, so my governor sold it.”

I noticed that Elliott, bristling, threw a venomous glance at the jovial marquess, and guessed that it was he who had bought the picture. He was furious at hearing himself, Virginian born and the descendant of a signatory of the Declaration, thus described.He had never in his life suffered so great an affront.And what made it worse was that Paul Barton was the object of his virulent hatred.He was a young man who had appeared in London soon after the war.He was twenty-three, blond, very good-looking, charming, a beautiful dancer, and had an ample fortune.He had brought a letter of introduction to Elliott, who with the kindness of heart natural to him had presented him to several of his friends.Not content with this he had given him some valuable hints on conduct.Delving back into his own experience, he had shown him how it was possible, by paying small attentions to old ladies and by lending a willing ear to distinguished men, however tedious, for a stranger to make his way in society.

But it was a different world that Paul Barton entered from that into which, a generation before, Elliott Templeton had penetrated by means of dogged perseverance. It was a world bent on amusing itself.Paul Barton's high spirits, pleasing exterior, and engaging manner did for him in a few weeks what Elliott had achieved only after years of industry and determination.Soon he no longer needed Elliott's help and took small pains to conceal the fact.He was pleasant to him when they met, but in an offhand way that deeply offended the older man.Elliott did not ask people to a party because he liked them, but because they helped to make it go, and since Paul Barton was popular he continued to invite him on occasion to his weekly luncheons；but the successful young man was generally engaged and twice he threw Elliott over at the last moment.Elliott had done this himself too often not to know it was because he had just had a more tempting invitation.

“I don't ask you to believe it，”Elliott told me, fuming，“but it's God's truth that when I see him now he patronizes me. ME.Titian.Titian，”he spluttered.“He wouldn't know a Titian if he saw one.”

I had never seen Elliott so angry and I guessed his wrath was caused by his belief that Paul Barton had asked about the picture maliciously, having somehow learnt that Elliott had bought it, and would make a funny story at his expense out of the noble lord's reply.

“He's nothing but a dirty little snob, and if there's one thing in the world I detest and despise it's snobbishness. He'd have been nowhere except for me.Would you believe it, his father makes office furniture.Office furniture.”He put withering scorn into the two words.“And when I tell people he simply doesn't exist in America, his origins couldn’t be more humble, they don’t seem to care.Take my word for it, my dear fellow, English society is as dead as the dodo.”

Nor did Elliott find France much better. There the great ladies of his youth, if still alive, were given over to bridge（a game he loathed），piety, and the care of their grandchildren.Manufacturers, Argentines, Chileans, American women separated or divorced from their husbands, inhabited the stately houses of the aristocracy and entertained with splendour, but at their parties Elliott was confounded to meet politicians who spoke French with a vulgar accent, journalists whose table manners were deplorable, and even actors.The scions of princely families thought it no shame to marry the daughters of shopkeepers.It was true Paris was gay, but with what a shoddy gaiety！The young, devoted to the mad pursuit of pleasure, thought nothing more amusing than to go from one stuffy little night club to another, drinking champagne at a hundred francs a bottle and dancing close-packed with the riff-raff of the town till five o'clock in the morning.The smoke, the heat, the noise made Elliott's head ache.This was not the Paris that he had accepted thirty years before as his spiritual home.This was not the Paris that good Americans went to when they died.

But Elliott had a flair. An inner monitor suggested to him that the Riviera was on the point of becoming once more the resort of rank and fashion.He knew the coast well from having often spent a few days in Monte Carlo at the Hôtel de Paris on his way back from Rome, whither his duties at the papal court had called him, or at Cannes in the villa of one or the other of his friends.But that was in the winter, and of late rumours had reached him that it was beginning to be well spoken of as a summer resort.The big hotels were remaining open；their summer visitors were listed in the social columns of the Paris Herald and Elliott read the familiar names with approval.

“The world is too much with me，”he said.“I have now reached a time of life when I am prepared to enjoy the beauties of nature.”

The remark may seem obscure. It isn't really.Elliott had always felt that nature was an impediment to the social life, and he had no patience with people who could bother to go to see a lake or a mountain when they had before their eyes a Regency commode or a painting by Watteau.He had at the time a considerable sum of money to spend.Henry Maturin, urged by his son and exasperated by the sight of his friends on the stock exchange who were making fortunes overnight, had surrendered at last to the current of events and, abandoning little by little his old conservatism, had seen no reason why he too should not get on the band wagon.He wrote to Elliott that he was as much opposed to gambling as he had ever been, but this was not gambling, it was an affirmation of his belief in the inexhaustible resources of the country.His optimism was based on common sense.He could see nothing to halt the progress of America.He ended by saying that he had bought on margin a number of sound securities for dear Louisa Bradley and was glad to be able to tell Elliott that she now had a profit of twenty thousand dollars.Finally, if Elliott wanted to make a little money and would allow him to act according to his judgement, he was confident that he would not be disappointed.Elliott, apt to use hackneyed quotations, remarked that he could resist anything but temptation；the consequence of which was that from then on, instead of turning to the social intelligence as he had done for many years when the Herald was brought him with his breakfast, he gave his first attention to the reports of the stock market.So successful were Henry Maturin's transactions on his behalf that now Elliott found himself with the tidy sum of fifty thousand dollars which he had done nothing to earn.

He decided to take his profit and buy a house on the Riviera. As a refuge from the world he chose Antibes, which held a strategic position between Cannes and Monte Carlo so that it could be conveniently reached from either；but whether it was the hand of Providence or his own sure instinct that led him to choose a spot that was soon to become the centre of fashion, it is impossible to say.To live in a villa with a garden had a suburban vulgarity that revolted his fastidious taste, so he acquired two houses in the old town looking on the sea, knocked them into one, and installed central heating, bathrooms, and the sanitary conveniences that American example has forced on a recalcitrant Europe.Pickling was all the rage just then, so he furnished the house with old Provençal furniture duly pickled and, surrendering discreetly to modernity, with modern fabrics.He was still unwilling to accept such painters as Picasso and Braque—“horrors, my dear fellow, horrors”—whom certain misguided enthusiasts were making such a fuss about, but felt himself at long last justified in extending his patronage to the Impressionists and so adorned his walls with some very pretty pictures.I remember a Monet of people rowing on a river, a Pissarro of a quay and a bridge on the Seine, a Tahitian landscape by Gauguin, and a charming Renoir of a young girl in profile with long yellow hair hanging down her back.His house when finished was fresh and gay, unusual, and simple with that simplicity that you knew could only have been achieved at great expense.

Then began the most splendid period of Elliott's life. He brought his excellent chef down from Paris and it was soon acknowledged that he had the best cuisine on the Riviera.He dressed his butler and his footman in white with gold straps on their shoulders.He entertained with a magnificence that never overstepped the bounds of good taste.The shores of the Mediterranean were littered with royalties from all parts of Europe：some lured there on account of theclimate, some in exile, and some because a scandalous past or an unsuitable marriage made it more convenient for them to inhabit a foreign country.There were Romanoffs from Russia, Hapsburgs from Austria, Bourbons from Spain, the two Sicilys, and Parma；there were princes of the House of Windsor and princes of the House of Bragança；there were Royal Highnesses from Sweden and Royal Highnesses from Greece：Elliott entertained them.There were princes and princesses not of royal blood, dukes and duchesses, marquesses and marchionesses, from Austria, Italy, Spain, Russia, and Belgium：Elliott entertained them.In winter the King of Sweden and the King of Denmark made sojourns on the coast；now and then Alfonso of Spain paid a hurried visit：Elliott entertained them.I never ceased to admire the way in which, while he bowed with courtly grace to those exalted personages, he managed to maintain the independent demeanour of the citizen of a country where all men are said to be born equal.

I had then, after some years of travel, bought a house on Cap Ferrat and thus saw a good deal of Elliott. I had risen so high in his good graces that sometimes he invited me to his very grandest parties.

“Come as a favour to me, my dear fellow，”he would say.“Of course I know just as well as you do that royalties ruin a party. But other people like to meet them and I think one owes it to oneself to show the poor things some attention.Though heaven knows they don't deserve it.They're the most ungrateful people in the world；they'll use you, and when they have no further use for you they'll cast you aside like a frayed shirt；they'll accept innumer-able favours from you, but there’s not one of them who’d cross the road to do the smallest thing for you in return.”

Elliott had taken pains to get on good terms with the local authorities, and the prefect of the district and the bishop of the diocese, accompanied by his vicar general, often graced his table. The bishop had been a cavalry officer before entering the Church and in the war had commanded a regiment.He was a rubicund, stoutish man, who affected the rough-and-ready language of the barracks, and his austere, cadaverous vicar general was always on pins and needles lest he should say something scandalous.He listened with a deprecating smile when his superior told his favourite stories.But the bishop conducted his diocese with remarkable competence, and his eloquence in the pulpit was no less moving than his sallies at the luncheon table were amusing.He approved of Elliott for his pious generosity to the Church and liked him for his amiability and the good food he provided；and the two became good friends.Elliott could thus flatter himself that he was making the best of both worlds and, if I may venture so to put it, effecting a very satisfactory working arrangement between God and Mammon.

Elliott was house-proud and he was anxious to show his new house to his sister；he had always felt a certain reserve in her approval of him and he wanted her to see the style in which he now lived and the friends he hobnobbed with. It was the definitive answer to her hesitations.She would have to admit that he had made good.He wrote and asked her to come over with Gray and Isabel, not to stay with him, for he had no room, but to stay as his guests at the near-by Hôtel du Cap.Mrs.Bradley replied that her travelling days were over, for her health was indifferent and she thought she was better off at home；and in any case it was impossible for Gray to absent himself from Chicago；business was booming and he was making a great deal of money and had to stay put.Elliott was attached to his sister and her letter alarmed him.He wrote to Isabel.She replied by cable that, though her mother was so far from well that she had to stay in bed one day a week, she was in no immediate danger and indeed with care might be expected to live a long time yet；but that Gray needed a rest and, with his father there to look after things, there was no reason why he should not take a holiday；so, not that summer but the next, she and Gray would come over.

On October the 23rd，1929，the New York market broke.

I was in London then and at first we in England did not realize how grave the situation was nor how distressing its results would be. For my own part, though chagrined at losing a considerable sum, it was for the most part paper profits that I lost, and when the dust had settled I found myself little the poorer in cash.I knew that Elliott had been gambling heavily and feared that he was badly hit, but I did not see him till we both returned to the Riviera for Christmas.He toldme then that Henry Maturin was dead and Gray ruined.

I know little of business matters and I dare say that my account of the events, given me by Elliott, will seem confused. So far as I could make out the catastrophe that had befallen the firm was due in part to Henry Maturin's self-will and in part to Gray's rashness.Henry Maturin at first would not believe that the break was serious, but persuaded himself that it was a plot of the New York brokers to put a quick one over their provincial brethren, and setting his teeth he poured forth money to support the market.He raged against the Chicago brokers who were letting themselves be stampeded by those scoundrels in New York.He had always prided himself on the fact that none of his smaller clients, widows with settled incomes, retired officers and such like, had ever lost a penny by following his advice, and now, instead of letting them take a loss, he supported their accounts out of his own pocket.He said he was prepared to go broke, he could make another fortune, but he could never hold up his head again if the little people who trusted him lost their all.He thought he was magnanimous；he was only vain.His great fortune melted and one night he had a heart attack.He was in his sixties, he had always worked hard, played hard, eaten too much, and drunk heavily；after a few hours of agony he died of coronary thrombosis.

Gray was left to deal with the situation alone. He had been speculating extensively on the side, without the knowledge of his father, and was personally in the greatest difficulty.His efforts to extricate himself failed.The banks would not lend him money；older men on the exchange told him that the only thing was to throw up the sponge.I am not clear about the rest of the story.He was unable to meet his obligations and was, I understand, declared bankrupt；he had already mortgaged his own house and was glad to hand it over to the mortgagees；his father's house on Lake Shore Drive and the house at Marvin were sold for what they would fetch；Isabel sold her jewels：all that was left them was the plantation in South Carolina, which was settled on Isabel and for which a purchaser could not be found.Gray was wiped out.

“And what about you, Elliott?”I asked.

“Oh, I'm not complaining，”he answered airily.“God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb.”

I did not question him further, for his financial affairs were no business of mine, but whatever his losses were I presumed that like the rest of us he had suffered.

The depression did not at first hit the Riviera badly. I heard of two or three people who had lost a good deal, many villas remained closed for the winter and several were put up for sale.The hotels were far from full and the Casino at Monte Carlo complained that the season was poor.But it was not for a couple of years that the draught made itself felt.Then an estate agent told me that on the stretch of coast that reaches from Toulon to the Italian border there were forty-eight thousand properties, large and small, to be sold.The shares of the Casino slumped.The great hotels put down their prices in a vain attempt to attract.The only foreigners to be seen were those who had always been so poor that they couldn't be poorer, and they spent no money because they had no money to spend.The shopkeepers were in despair.But Elliott neither diminished his staff nor lessened their wages as many did；he continued to provide choice food and choice wines to royal and titled persons.He bought himself a large new car, which he imported from America and on which he had to pay a heavy duty.He gave generously to the charity the bishop had organized to provide free meals for the families of the workless.In fact he lived as though there had never been a crisis and half the world were not staggering from its effects.

I discovered the reason by chance：Elliott had by this time ceased to go to England except for a fortnight once a year to buy clothes, but he still transferred his establishment to his apartment in Paris for three months in the autumn and for May and June, these being the periods when the Riviera was deserted by Elliott's friends；he liked the summer there, partly on account of the bathing, but chiefly, I think, because the hot weather gave him the opportunity to indulge in a gaiety of dress that his sense of decorum had always forced him to eschew. He would appear then in trousers of startling colour, red, blue, green, or yellow, and with them wear singlets of contrasting hue, mauve, violet, puce, or harlequin, and would accept the compliments his attire clamoured for with the deprecating grace of an actress who is told that she has played a new role divinely.

I happened to be spending a day in Paris in the spring on my way back to Cap Ferrat and had asked Elliott to lunch with me. We met in the Ritz bar, no longer thronged with college boys come from America to have a good time, but as deserted as a playwright after the first night of an unsuccessful play.We had a cocktail, a transatlantic habit to which Elliott had at last become reconciled, and ordered our lunch.When we had finished, he suggested that we should go round the curio shops, and though I told him I had no money to spend I was glad enough to accompany him.We walked through the Place Vendôme and he asked if I would mind going in to Charvet’s for a moment；he had ordered some things and wanted to know if they were ready.It appeared that he was having some vests made, and some drawers, and he was having his initials embroidered on them.The vests had not come in yet, but the drawers were there and the shop assistant asked Elliott if he would like to see them.

“I would，”said he, and when the man had gone to fetch them added to me；“I have them made to order on a pattern of my own.”

They were brought, and to me, except that they were of silk, looked exactly like the drawers I had frequently bought for myself at Macy's；but what caught my eye was that above the intertwined E. T.of the initials was a count's crown.I did not say a word.

“Very nice, very nice，”said Elliott.“Well, when the undershirts are ready you'll send them along.”

We left the shop and Elliott, as he walked away, turned to me with a smile.

“Did you notice the crown?To tell you the truth, I'd forgotten about it when I asked you to come in to Charvet's. I don't think I've had occasion to tell you that His Holiness has been graciously pleased to revive in my favour my old family title.”

“Your what?”I said, startled out of my politeness.

Elliott raised a disapproving eyebrow.

“Didn't you know?I am descended in the female line from the Count de Lauria who came over to England in the suite of Philip the Second and married a maid of honour of Queen Mary's.”

“Our old friend Bloody Mary?”

“That, I believe, is what heretics call her，”Elliott answered stiffly.“I don't think I ever told you that I spent September of'twenty-nine in Rome. I thought it a bore having to go because Rome is empty then, but it was fortunate for me that my sense of duty prevailed over my desire for worldly pleasures.My friends at the Vatican told me that the crash was coming and strongly advised me to sell all my American securities.The Catholic Church has the wisdom of twenty centuries behind it and I didn't hesitate for a moment.I cabled to Henry Maturin to sell everything and buy gold, and I cabled to Louisa to tell her to do the same.Henry cabled back asking me if I was crazy and said he'd do nothing until I confirmed the instructions.I immediately cabled in the most peremptory manner, telling him to carry them out and to cable me that he had done so.Poor Louisa paid no attention to my advice and suffered for it.”

“So when the crash came you were sitting pretty?”

“An Americanism, my dear fellow, which I see no occasion for you to use, but it expresses my situation with a good deal of accuracy. I lost nothing；in fact I had made what you would probably call a packet.I was able some time later to buy back my securities for a fraction of their original cost, and since I owed it all to what I can only describe as the direct interposition of Providence I felt it only right and proper that I should do something for Providence in return.”

“Oh, and how did you set about that?”

“Well, you know the Duce has been reclaiming great tracts of land in the Pontine Marshes and it was represented to me that His Holiness was gravely concerned at the lack of places of worship for the settlers. So, to cut a long story short, I built a little Romanesque church, an exact copy of one I knew in Provence, and perfect in every detail, which, though I say it myself, is a gem.It is dedicated to St.Martin because I was lucky enough to find an old stained-glass window representing St.Martin in the act of cutting his cloak in two to give half of it to a naked beggar, and as the symbolism seemed so apt I bought it and placed it over the high altar.”

I didn't interrupt Elliott to ask him what connexion he saw between the Saint's celebrated action and the rake-offon the pretty penny he had made by selling out in the nick of time which, like an agent's commission, he was paying to a higher power. But to a prosaic person like me symbolism is often obscure.He went on.

“When I was privileged to show the photographs to the Holy Father, he was gracious enough to tell me that he could see at a glance that I was a man of impeccable taste, and he added that it was a pleasure to him to find in this degenerate age someone who combined devotion to the Church with such rare artistic gifts. A memorable experience, my dear fellow, a memorable experience.But no one was more surprised than I when shortly afterwards it was intimated to me that he had been pleased to confer a title upon me.As an American citizen I feel it more modest not to use it, except of course at the Vatican, so I have forbidden my Joseph to address me as Monsieur le Comte, and I trust you will respect my confidence.I don't wish it bruited abroad.But I would not like His Holiness to think that I do not value the honour that he has done me and it is purely out of respect for him that I have the crown embroidered on my personal linen.I don't mind telling you that I take a modest pride in concealing my rank under the sober pin-stripe of an American gentleman.”

We parted. Elliott told me he would come down to the Riviera at the end of June.He did not do so.He had just made his arrangements to transfer his staff from Paris, intending to drive down leisurely in his car so that every-thing should be in perfect order on his arrival, when he received a cable from Isabel to say that her mother had suddenly taken a turn for the worse.Elliott, besides being fond of his sister, had, as I have said, a strong strain of family feeling.He took the first ship out of Cherbourg and from New York went to Chicago.He wrote to tell me that Mrs.Bradley was very ill and grown so thin that it was a shock to him.She might last a few weeks longer or even a few months, but in any case he felt it his sad duty to remain with her till the end.He said he found the great heat more supportable than he had expected, but the lack of congenial society only tolerable because at such a moment he had in any case no heart for it.He said he was disappointed with the way his fellow-countrymen had reacted to the depression；he would have expected them to take their misfortune with more equanimity.Knowing that nothing is easier than to bear other people's calamities with fortitude, I thought that Elliott, richer now than he had ever been in his life, was perhaps hardly entitled to be severe.He ended by giving me messages for several of his friends and bade me by no means forget to explain to everyone I met why it was that his house must remain closed for the summer.

Little more than a month later I received another letter from him to tell me that Mrs. Bradley had died.He wrote with sincerity and emotion.I should never have thought him capable of expressing himself with such dignity, real feeling, and simplicity, had I not long known that notwithstanding his snobbishness and his absurd affectations Elliott was a kindly, affectionate, and honest man.In the course of this letter he told me that Mrs.Bradley's affairs appeared to be in some disorder.Her elder son, a diplomatist, being chargé d’affaires in Tokyo during the absence of the ambassador, had been of course unable to leave his post.Her second son, Templeton, who had been in the Philippines when I first knew the Bradleys, had been in due course recalled to Washington and occupied a responsible position in the State Department.He had come with his wife to Chicago when his mother’s condition was recognized as hopeless, but had been obliged to return to the capital immediately after the funeral.In these circumstances Elliott felt that he must remain in America until things were straightened out.Mrs.Bradley had divided her fortune equally between her three children, but it appeared that her losses in the crash of’twenty-nine had been substantial.Fortunately they had found a purchaser for the farm at Marvin.Elliott in his letter referred to it as dear Louisa’s country place.

“It is always sad when a family has to part with its ancestral home，”he wrote，“but of late years I have seen this forced upon so many of my English friends that I feel that my nephews and Isabel must accept the inevitable with the same courage and resignation that they have. Noblesse oblige.”

They had been lucky too in disposing of Mrs. Bradley's house in Chicago.There had long been a scheme afoot to tear down the row of houses in one of which Mrs.Bradley lived and build in their stead a great block of apartments, but it had been held up by her obstinate determination to die in the house in which she had lived.But no sooner was the breath out of her body than the promoters came forward with an offer and it was promptly accepted.Yet even at that Isabel was left very ill provided for.

After the crash Gray had tried to get a job, even as a clerk in the office of such of the brokers as had weathered the storm, but there was no business. He applied to his old friends to give him something to do, however humble and however badly paid, but he applied in vain.His frenzied efforts to stave off the disaster that finally overwhelmed him, the burden of anxiety, the humiliation, resulted in a nervous breakdown, and he began to have headaches so severe that he was incapacitated for twenty-four hours and as limp as a wet rag when they ceased.It had appeared to Isabel that they could not do better than go down with the children to the plantation in South Carolina till Gray regained his health.In its day it had brought in a hundred thousand dollars a year for its rice crop, but for long now had been no more than a wilderness of marsh and gumwood, useful only to sportsmen who wanted to shoot duck, and no purchaser could be found for it.There they had lived off and on since the crash and there they proposed to return till conditions improved and Gray could find employment.

“I couldn't allow that，”Elliott wrote.“Why, my dear fellow, they live like pigs. Isabel without a maid, no governess for the children, and only a couple of coloured women to look after them.So I've offered them my apart-ment in Paris and proposed that they should stay there till things change in this fantastic country.I shall provide them with a staff, as a matter of fact my kitchen-maid is a very good cook, so I shall leave her with them and I can easily find someone to take her place.I shall arrange to settle the accounts myself so that Isabel can spend her small income on her clothes and the menus plaisirs of the family.This means of course that I shall spend much more of my time on the Riviera and so hope to see a great deal more of you, my dear fellow, than I have in the past.London and Paris being now what they are, I'm really more at home on the Riviera.It's the only place remaining where I can meet people who speak my own language.I dare say I shall go to Paris now and then for a few days, but when I do, I don't in the least mind pigging it at the Ritz.I’m glad to say that I’ve at long last persuaded Gray and Isabel to accede to my wishes and I’m bringing them all over as soon as the necessary arrangements can be made.The furniture and the pictures（very poor in quality, my dear fellow, and of the most doubtful authenticity）are being sold the week after next and meanwhile, as I thought to live in the house till the last moment would be painful to them, I have brought them to stay with me at the Drake.I shall settle them in when we get to Paris and then come down to the Riviera.Don’t forget to remember me to your royal neighbour.”

Who could deny that Elliott, that arch-snob, was also the kindest, most considerate and generous of men?





CHAPTER FOUR


1


Elliott, having installed the Maturins in his spacious apartment on the Left Bank, returned to the Riviera at the end of the year. He had planned his house to suit his own convenience and there was no room in it for a family of four, so that, even if he had wanted to, he could not have had them to stay with him there.I do not think he regretted it.He was well aware that as a man by himself he was a more desirable asset than if he must be accompanied by a niece and a nephew, and he could hardlv expect to arrange his own distinguished little parties（a matter over which he took immense trouble）if he had to count invariably on the presence of two house guests.

“It's much better for them to settle down in Paris and accustom themselves to civilized life. Besides, the two girls are old enough to go to school and I've found one not far from my apartment which I'm assured is very select.”

In consequence of this I did not see Isabel till the spring when, because I had some work to do that made it desirable for me to spend some weeks there, I went to Paris and took a couple of rooms in a hotel just out of the Place Vendôme.It was a hotel I frequented, not only for its convenient situation, but because it had an air.It was a big old house built around a courtyard and it had been an inn for close upon two hundred years.The bathrooms were far from luxurious and the plumbing far from satisfactory；the bedrooms with their iron beds, painted white, their old-fashioned white counterpanes, and their huge armoires à glace had a poverty-stricken look；but the parlours were furnished with fine old furniture.The sofa, the armchairs, dated from the gaudy reign of Napoleon the Third, and, though I could not say they were comfortable, they had a florid charm.In that room I lived in the past of the French novelists.When I looked at the Empire clock under its glass case I thought that a pretty woman in ringlets and a flounced dress might have watched the minute hand move as she waited for a visit from Rastignac, the well-born adventurer whose career in novel after novel Balzac followed from his humble beginnings to his ultimate grandeur.Dr.Bianchon, the physician who was so real to Balzac that when he lay dying he said：“Only Bianchon can save me，”might well have come into that room to feel the pulse and look at the tongue of a noble dowager from the provinces who had come to Paris to see an attorney about a lawsuit and had called in a doctor for a passing ailment.At that bureau a lovesick woman in a crinoline, her hair parted in the middle, may have written a passionate letter to her faithless lover, or a peppery old gentleman in a green frock coat and a stock indited an angry epistle to his extravagant son.

The day after my arrival I called up Isabel and asked if she would give me a cup of tea if I came along at five. It was ten years since I'd seen her.She was reading a French novel when I was ushered into the drawing-room by a staid butler, and getting up she took both my hands and greeted me with a warm and winning smile.I had never seen her more than a dozen times, and only twice alone, but she made me feel at once that we were not casual acquaintances but old friends.The ten years that had passed had reduced the gulf that separated the young girl from the middle-aged man and I was no longer conscious of the disparity of age between us.With the delicate flattery of a woman of the world she treated me as if I were her contemporary, and in five minutes we were chatting as frankly and as unconstrainedly as though we were playmates who had been in the habit of meeting without interruption.She had acquired ease, self-possession, and assurance.

But what chiefly struck me was the change in her appearance. I remembered her as a pretty, bouncing girl who threatened to run to fat；I did not know whether, realizing this, she had taken heroic measures to reduce her weight or whether it was an unusual, though happy, accident of childbearing；but now she was as slender as anyone could wish.The mode of the moment accentuated this.She was in black, and at a glance I noticed that her silk dress, neither too plain nor too fancy, had been made by one of the best dressmakers in Paris, and she wore it with the careless confidence of a woman to whom it is second nature to wear expensive clothes.Ten years before, even with Elliott to advise, her frocks had been somewhat on the showy side and she had worn them as though she were not quite at home in them.Marie Louise de Florimond could not have said now that she lacked chic.She had chic to the tips of her rose-painted nails.Her features had fined down and it occurred to me that she had as pretty and as straight a nose as I had ever seen on a woman's face.There was not a line on her forehead or under her hazel eyes, and though her skin had lost the fresh bloom of extreme youth, its texture was as fine as ever；it obviously owed something now to lotions, creams, and massage, but they had given it a soft, transparent delicacy that was singularly attractive.Her thin cheeks were very faintly rouged and her mouth was painted with discretion.She wore her bright brown hair bobbed as was the fashion of the moment and marcelled.She had no rings on her fingers, and I remembered that Elliott had told me that she had sold her jewellery；her hands, though not remarkably small, were well made.At that period women wore short frocks in the day-time and I saw that her legs in champagne-coloured stockings were shapely, long, and slender.Legs are the undoing of many a comely woman；Isabel's legs, as a girl her most unfortunate trait, were now uncommonly good.In fact from the pretty girl whose glowing health, high spirits, and brilliant colour had given her attractiveness she was become a beautiful woman.That she owed her beauty in some degree to art, discipline, and mortification of the flesh did not seem to matter.The result was vastly satisfactory.It might be that the grace of her gestures, the felicity of her carriage, had been acquired by takingthought, but they had a look of perfect spontaneity.I conceived the notion that these four months in Paris had put the finishing touches to a work of conscious art that had been years in the making.Elliott, even in his most censorious mood, could not but have approved of her；I, a person less difficult to please, found her ravishing.

Gray had gone to Mortefontaine to play golf, but she told me he would be in presently.

“And you must see my two little girls. They've gone to the Tuileries Gardens, but they ought to be in soon.They're sweet.”

We talked of one thing and another. She liked being in Paris and they were very comfortable in Elliott's apartment.Before leaving them he had made them acquainted with such of his friends as he thought they would like and they had already a pleasant circle of acquaintances.He had pressed them to entertain as abundantly as he had been in the habit of doing.

“You know, it tickles me to death to think that we're living like quite rich people when really we're absolutely broke.”

“Is it as bad as that?”

She chuckled, and now I remembered the light, gay laugh that I had found so pleasing in her ten years before.

“Gray hasn't a penny and I have almost exactly the income Larry had when he wanted me to marry him and I wouldn't because I thought we couldn't possibly live on it and now I've got two children besides. It's rather funny, isn’t it?”

“I'm glad you can see the joke of it.”

“What news have you of Larry?”

“I?None. I haven't set eyes on him since before you were last in Paris.I knew slightly some of the people he used to know and I did ask them what had become of him, but that was years ago.No one seemed to know anything about him.He just vanished.”

“We know the manager of the bank in Chicago where Larry has his account and he told us that every now and then he got a draft from some queer place. China, Burma, India.He seems to have been getting around.”

I did not hesitate to put the question that came to the tip of my tongue. After all, if you want to know something the best way is to ask.

“D'you wish now that you had married him?”

She smiled engagingly.

“I've been very happy with Gray. He's been a wonderful husband.You know, until the crash came we had a grand time together.We like the same people, and we like doing the same things.He's very sweet.And it's nice being adored；he's just as much in love with me now as when we first married.He thinks I’m the most wonderful girl in the world.You can’t imagine how kind and considerate he is.It was quite absurd how generous he was；you see, he thought nothing was too good for me.D’you know, he’s never said an unkind or harsh thing to me all these years we’ve been married.Oh, I’ve been very lucky.”

I asked myself if she thought she'd answered my question. I changed the conversation.

“Tell me about your little girls.”

As I spoke the doorbell rang.

“Here they are. You shall see for yourself.”

In a moment they came in followed by a nursery governess and I was introduced first to Joan, the elder, and then to Priscilla. Each in turn gave a polite little knick as she took my hand.One was eight and the other six.They were tall for their age；Isabel of course was tall, and Gray, I remembered, was immense；but they were pretty only in the way all children are pretty.They looked frail.They had their father's black hair and their mother's hazel eyes.The presence of a stranger did not make them shy, and they talked eagerly to her of their doings in the gardens.They cast eager eyes on the dainties Isabel's cook had provided for tea, but which neither of us had touched, and being given permission to have one thing were thrown into a small agony of doubt as to which to choose.It was pleasant to see the demonstrative affectionthey had for their mother and the three of them clustered together made a charming picture.When they had eaten the little cake each had selected, Isabel sent them away and they went without a word of expostulation.I received the impression that she was bringing them up to do as they were told.

When they were gone I said the usual things one says to a mother about her children and Isabel accepted my compliments with evident, but somewhat casual, pleasure. I asked her how Gray was liking Paris.

“Well enough. Uncle Elliott left us a car so he can go and play golf almost every day and he's joined the Traveller's Club and he plays bridge there.Of course, Uncle Elliott's offer to support us in this apartment has been a godsend.Gray's nerves went all to pieces and he still has those terrible headaches；even if he could get a job he isn't really fit to take it；and naturally that worries him.He wants to work, he feels he ought to, and it humiliates him not to be wanted.You see, he feels it’s a man’s business to work and if he can’t work he may just as well be dead.He can’t bear his feeling of being a drug on the market, and I only got him to come here by persuading him that rest and change would bring him back to normalcy.But I know he won’t be happy till he gets back into harness.”

“I'm afraid you've had a very rough time these last two and a half years.”

“Well, you know, when the crash came at first I simply couldn't believe it. It seemed inconceivable to me that we should be ruined.I could understand that other people should be ruined, but that we should be-well, it just seemed impossible.I went on thinking that something would happen to save us at the last moment.And then, when the final blow came, I felt that life wasn't worth living any more, I didn't think I could face the future；it was too black.For a fortnight I was absolutely miserable.God, it was awful, having to part with everything, knowing there wouldn't be any fun any more, having to do without everything I liked-and then at the end of a fortnight I said：‘Oh, to hell with it, I'm not going to give it another thought，’and I promise you I never have.I don’t regret anything.I had a lot of fun while it lasted and now it’s gone, it’s gone.”

“It's obvious that ruin is easier to bear in a luxurious apartment in a fashionable quarter, with a competent butler and an excellent cook free and for nothing, and when one can cover one's haggard bones with a dress by Chanel, isn't it?”

“Lanvin，”she giggled.“I see you haven't changed much in ten years. I don't suppose you'll believe me, being a cynical brute, but I'm not sure if I'd have accepted Uncle Elliott’s offer except for Gray and the children.On my twenty-eight hundred a year we could have managed perfectly well on the plantation and we’d have grown rice and rye and corn and kept pigs.After all I was born and raised on a farm in Illinois.”

“In a manner of speaking，”I smiled, knowing that in point of fact she had been born in an expensive clinic in New York.

At this point Gray came in. It is true that I had only seen him two or three times twelve years before, but I had seen a photograph of him with his bride（Elliott kept it in a splendid frame on his piano along with signed photo-graphs of the King of Sweden, the Queen of Spain, and the Duc de Guise）and I had a fair recollection of him.I was taken aback.His hair had receded on the temples and there was a small bald patch on the crown, his face was puffy and red, and he had a double chin.He had put on a lot of weight during years of good living and hard drinking, and only his great height saved him from being grossly obese.But the thing I most noticed was the expression of his eyes.I remembered quite well the trusting, open frankness of their Irish blue, when the world was before him and he hadn't a care in the world；now I seemed to see in them a sort of puzzled dismay, and even if I hadn't known the facts I think I might have guessed that something had occurred to destroy his confidence in himself and in the ordered course of events.I felt a kind of diffidence in him, as though he had done wrong, though unwittingly, and were ashamed.It was plain that his nerve was shaken.He greeted me with pleasant cordiality and indeed seemed as glad to see me as if I were an old friend, but I had the impression that his rather noisy heartiness was a habit of manner that scarcely corresponded with his inner feeling.

Drinks were brought in and he mixed us a cocktail. He'd played a couple of rounds of golf and was satisfied with his game.He went into somewhat verbose detail over the difficulties he had surmounted over one of the holes and Isabel listened with an appearance of lively interest.After a few minutes having made a date to take them to dine andsee a play, I left.

I fell into the habit of dropping in to see Isabel three or four times a week in the afternoon after my day's work was over. She was generally alone at that hour and glad to have a gossip.The persons to whom Elliott had introduced her were much older than she and I discovered that she had few friends of her own generation.Mine were for the most part busy till dinnertime and I found it more agreeable to talk with Isabel than to go to my club and play bridge with rather grouchy Frenchmen who did not particularly welcome the intrusion of a stranger.Her charming way of treating me as if she and I were of an age made conversation easy and we joked and laughed and chaffed one another, chatting now about ourselves, now about our common acquaintances, now about books and pictures, so that the time passed very agreeably.One of the defects of my character is that I can never grow used to the plainness of people；however sweet a disposition a friend of mine may have, years of intimacy can never reconcile me to his bad teeth or lopsided nose：on the other hand I never cease to delight in his comeliness and after twenty years of familiarity I am still able to take pleasure in a well-shaped brow or the delicate line of a cheekbone.So I never came into Isabel's presence without feeling anew a little thrill of pleasure in the perfection of her oval face, in the creamy delicacy of her skin, and in the bright warmth of her hazel eyes.

Then a very unexpected thing happened.

In all big cities there are self-contained groups that exist without intercommunication, small worlds within a greater world that lead their lives, their members dependent upon one another for companionship, as though they inhabited islands separated from each other by an unnavigable strait. Of no city, in my experience, is this more true than of Paris.There high society seldom admits outsiders into its midst, the politicians live in their own corrupt circle, the bourgeoisie, great and small, frequent one another, writers congregate with writers（it is remarkable in André Gide’s Journal to see with how few people he seems to have been intimate who did not follow his own calling），painters hobnob with painters and musicians with musicians.The same thing is true of London, but in a less marked degree；there birds of a feather flock much less together, and there are a dozen houses where at the same table you may meet a duchess, an actress, a painter, a member of Parliament, a lawyer, a dressmaker, and an author.

The events of my life have led me at one time and another to dwell transitorily in pretty well all the worlds of Paris, even（through Elliott）in the closed world of the Boulevard St. Germain；but that which I liked best, better than the discreet circle that has its centre in what is now called the Avenue Foch, better than the cosmopolitan crew that patronize Larue's and the Café de Paris, better than the noisy sordid gaiety of Montmartre, is that section of which the artery is the Boulevard du Montparnasse.In my youth I spent a year in a tiny apartment near the Lion de Belfort, on the fifth floor, from which I had a spacious view of the cemetery.Montparnasse has still for me the tranquil air of a provincial town that was characteristic of it then.When I pass through the dingy narrow Rue d’Odessa I remember with a pang the shabby restaurant where we used to foregather to dine, painters and illustrators and sculptors, I，but for Arnold Bennett on occasion, the only writer, and sit late discussing excitedly, absurdly, angrily, painting and literature.It is still a pleasure to me to stroll down the boulevard and look at the young people who are as young as I was then and invent stories for myself about them.When I have nothing better to do I take a taxi and go and sit in the old Café du Dôme.It is no longer what it was then, the meeting place exclusively of Bohemia；the small tradesmen of the neighbourhood have taken to visiting it, and strangers from the other side of the Seine come to it in the hope of seeing a world that has ceased to exist.Students come to it still, of course, painters and writers, but most of them are foreigners；and when you sit there you hear around you as much Russian, Spanish, German, and English as French.But I have a notion that they are saying verymuch the same sort of things as we said forty years ago, only they speak of Picasso instead of Manet and of André Breton instead of Guillaume Apollinaire.My heart goes out to them.

When I had been in Paris about a fortnight I was sitting one evening at the Dôme and since the terrace was crowded I had been forced to take a table in the front row.It was fine and warm.The plane trees were just bursting into leaf and there was in the air that sense of leisure, lightheartedness, and alacrity that was peculiar to Paris.I felt at peace with myself, but not lethargically, with exhilaration rather.Suddenly a man walking past me, stopped and with a grin that displayed a set of very white teeth said：“Hello！”I looked at him blankly.He was tall and thin.He wore no hat and he had a mop of dark brown hair that badly needed cutting.His upper lip and his chin were concealed by a thick brown beard.His forehead and his neck were deeply tanned.He wore a frayed shirt, without a tie, a brown, threadbare coat, and a pair of shabby grey slacks.He looked a bum and to the best of my belief I had never seen him before.I put him down for one of those good-for-nothings who have gone to the devil in Paris and I expected him to pull a hard-luck story to wheedle a few francs out of me for a dinner and a bed.He stood in front of me, his hands in his pockets, showing his white teeth, with a look of amusement in his dark eyes.

“You don't remember me?”he said.

“I've never set eyes on you in my life.”

I was prepared to give him twenty francs, but I wasn't prepared to let him get away with the bluff that we knew one another.

“Larry，”he said.

“Good God！Sit down.”He chuckled, stepped forward and took the empty chair at my table.“Have a drink.”I beckoned to the waiter.“How could you expect me to recognize you with all that hair on your face?”

The waiter came and he ordered an orangeade. Now that I looked at him I remembered the peculiarity of his eyes, which came from the black of the iris being as black as that of the pupil and which gave them at once intensity and opaqueness.

“How long have you been in Paris?”I asked.

“A month.”

“Are you going to stay?”

“For a while.”

While I asked these questions my mind was busy. I noticed that the cuffs of his trousers were ragged and that there were holes in the elbows of his coat.He looked as destitute as any beachcomber I had ever met in an Eastern port.It was hard in those days to forget the depression and I wondered whether the crash of'twenty-nine had left him penniless.I didn't much like the thought of that and not being a person to beat about the bush I asked outright：

“Are you down and out?”

“No, I'm all right. What makes you think that?”

“Well, you look as if you could do with a square meal and the things you've got on are only fit for the garbage can.”

“Are they as bad as all that?I never thought about it. As a matter of fact I have been meaning to get myself a few odds and ends, but I never seem able to get down to it.”

I thought he was shy or proud and I didn't see why I should put up with that sort of nonsense.

“Don't be a fool, Larry. I'm not a millionaire, but I'm not poor.If you're short of cash let me lend you a few thousand francs.That won't break me.”

He laughed outright.

“Thanks a lot, but I'm not short of cash. I've got more money than I can spend.”

“Notwithstanding the crash?”

“Oh, that didn't affect me. Everything I had was in government bonds.I don't know whether they went down in value, I never inquired, but I do know that Uncle Sam went on paying up on the coupons like the decent old party he is.In point of fact I've been spending so little during the last few years, I must have quite a bit in hand.”

“Where have you come from now then?”

“India.”

“Oh, I heard you'd been there. Isabel told me.She apparently knows the manager of your bank in Chicago.”

“Isabel?When did you last see her?”

“Yesterday.”

“She's not in Paris?”

“She is indeed. She's living in Elliott Templeton's apartment.”

“That's grand. I'd love to see her.”

Though I was watching his eyes pretty closely while we were exchanging these remarks I could discern only a natural surprise and pleasure, but no feeling more complicated.

“Gray's there too. You know they're married?”

“Yes, Uncle Bob-Dr. Nelson, my guardian-wrote and told me, but he died some years ago.”

It occurred to me that with this break in what appeared his only link with Chicago and his friends there he probably knew nothing of what had happened. I told him of the birth of Isabel's two daughters, of the death of Henry Maturin and Louisa Bradley, of Gray's ruin and of Elliott's generosity.

“Is Elliott here too?”

“No.”

For the first time in forty years Elliott was not spending the spring in Paris. Though looking younger he was now seventy and as usual with men of that age there were days when he felt tired and ill.Little by little he had given up taking any but walking exercise.He was nervous about his health and his doctor came to see him twice a week to thrust into an alternate buttock a hypodermic needle with the fashionable injection of the moment.At every meal, at home or abroad, he took from his pocket a little gold box from which he extracted a tablet which he swallowed with the reserved air of one performing a religious rite.His doctor had recommended him to take the cure at Montecatini, a watering-place in the north of Italy, and after this he proposed to go to Venice to look for a font of a design suitable to his Romanesque church.He was less unwilling to leave Paris unvisited since each year he found it socially more unsatisfactory.He did not like old people, and resented it when he was invited to meet only persons of his own age, and the young he found vapid.The adornment of the church he had built was now a main interest of his life and here he could indulge his ineradicable passion for buying works of art with the comfortable assurance that he was doing it to the glory of God.He had found in Rome an early altar of honey-coloured stone and had been dickering in Florence for six months for a triptych of the Siennese school to put over it.

Then Larry asked me how Gray was liking Paris.

“I'm afraid he's feeling rather lost here.”

I tried to explain to him how Gray had struck me. He listened to me with his eyes fixed on my face in a meditative, unblinking gaze that suggested to me, I don't know why, that he was listening to me not with his ears, but with some inner more sensitive organ of hearing.It was queer and not very comfortable.

“But you'll see for yourself，”I finished.

“Yes, I'd love to see them. I suppose I shall find the address in the phone book.”

“But if you don't want to scare them out of their wits and drive the children into screaming hysterics, I think you'd be wise to have your hair cut and your beard shaved.”

He laughed.

“I've been thinking of it. There's no object in making myself conspicuous.”

“And while you're about it you might get yourself a new outfit.”

“I suppose I am a bit shabby. When I came to leave India I found that I had nothing but the clothes I stand up in.”

He looked at the suit I was wearing, and asked me who my tailor was. I told him, but added that he was in Londonand so couldn't be of much use to him.We dropped the subject and he began to talk again of Gray and Isabel.

“I've been seeing quite a lot of them，”I said.“They're very happy together. I've never had a chance of talking to Gray alone, and anyway I dare say he wouldn't talk to me about Isabel, but I know he's devoted to her.His face is rather sullen in repose and his eyes are harassed, but when he looks at Isabel such a gentle, kind look comes into them, it’s rather moving.I have a notion that all through their trouble she stood by him like a rock and he never forgets how much he owes her.You’ll find Isabel changed.”I didn’t tell him she was beautiful as she had never been before.I wasn’t sure he had the discernment to see how the pretty, strapping girl had made herself into the wonderfully graceful, delicate, and exquisite woman.There are men who are affronted by the aids that art can supply to feminine nature.“She’s very good to Gray.She’s taking infinite pains to restore his confidence in himself.”

But it was growing late and I asked Larry if he would come along the boulevard and dine with me.

“No, I don't think I will, thanks，”he answered.“I must be off.”

He got up, nodded in a friendly way, and stepped out on to the pavement.

I saw Gray and Isabel next day and told them that I had seen Larry. They were as much surprised as I had been.

“It'll be wonderful to see him，”said Isabel.“Let's call him up at once.”

Then I remembered that I hadn't thought of asking him where he was staying. Isabel gave me hell.

“I'm not sure he'd have told me if I had，”I protested, laughing.“Probably my subconscious had something to do with it. Don't you remember, he never liked telling people where he lived.It was one of his oddities.He may walk in at any moment.”

“That would be like him，”said Gray.“Even in the old days you could never count on his being where you expected him to be. He was here today and gone tomorrow.You'd see him in a room and think in a moment you'd go and say hello to him and when you turned round he'd disappeared.”

“He always was the most exasperating fellow，”said Isabel.“It's no good denying that. I suppose we shall just have to wait till it suits him to turn up.”

He didn't come that day, nor the next, nor the day after. Isabel accused me of having invented the story to annoy.I promised her I hadn't and sought to give her reasons why he hadn't shown up.But they were implausible.Within myself I wondered whether on thinking it over he hadn't made up his mind that he just didn't want to see Gray and Isabel and had wandered off somewhere or other away from Paris.I had a feeling already that he never took root anywhere, but was always prepared at a moment’s notice, for a reason that seemed good to him or on a whim, to move on.

He came at last. It was a rainy day and Gray hadn't gone to Mortefontaine.The three of us were together, Isabel and I drinking a cup of tea, Gray sipping a whisky and Perrier, when the butler opened the door and Larry strolled in.Isabel with a cry sprang to her feet and throwing herself into his arms kissed him on both cheeks.Gray, his fat red face redder than ever, warmly wrung his hand.

“Gee, I'm glad to see you, Larry，”he said, his voice choked with emotion.

Isabel bit her lip and I saw she was constraining herself not to cry.

“Have a drink, old man，”said Gray unsteadily.

I was touched by their delight at seeing the wanderer. It must have been pleasant for him to perceive how much he meant to them.He smiled happily.It was plain to me that he was, however, completely self-possessed.He noticed the tea things.

“I'll have a cup of tea，”he said.

“Oh, gosh, you don't want tea，”cried Gray.“Let's have a bottle of champagne.”

“I'd prefer tea，”smiled Larry.

His composure had on the others the effect he may have intended. They calmed down, but looked at him still with fond eyes.I don't mean to suggest that he responded to their natural exuberance with an ungracious coldness；on the contrary, he was as cordial and charming as one could wish；but I was conscious in his manner of something that I could only describe as remoteness and I wondered what it signified.

“Why didn't you come and see us at once, you horror?”cried Isabel, with a pretence of indignation.“I've been hanging out of the window for the last five days to see you coming and every time the bell rang my heart leapt to my mouth and I had all I could do to swallow it again.”

Larry chuckled.

“Mr. M.told me I looked so tough that your man would never let me through the door.I flew over to London to get some clothes.”

“You needn't have done that，”I smiled.“You could have got a reach-me-down at the Printemps or the Belle Jardinière.”

“I thought if I was going to do it at all, I'd better do the thing in style. I haven't bought any European clothes for ten years.I went to your tailor and said I wanted a suit in three days.He said it would take a fortnight, so we compromised on four.I got back from London an hour ago.”

He wore a blue serge that nicely fitted his slim figure, a white shirt with a soft collar, a blue silk tie, and brown shoes. He had had his hair cut short and shaved off the hair on his face.He looked not only neat, but well-groomed.It was a transformation.He was very thin；his cheekbones were more prominent, his temples hollower, and his eyes in the deep sockets larger than I remembered them；but notwithstanding he looked very well；he looked, indeed, with his deeply sunburnt, unlined face, amazingly young.He was a year younger than Gray, they were both in their early thirties, but whereas Gray looked ten years more than his age, Larry looked ten years less.Gray's movements, owing to his great bulk, were deliberate and rather heavy；but Larry's were light and easy.His manner was boyish, gay, and debonair, but withal it had a serenity that I was peculiarly conscious of and that I did not recollect in the lad I had known before.And as the conversation proceeded, flowing without difficulty as was natural in old friends with so many common memories, with bits of news about Chicago thrown in by Gray and Isabel, trivial gossip, one thing leading to another, with airy laughter, my impression persisted that in Larry, though his laughter was frank and he listened with evident pleasure to Isabel's breezy chatter, there was a very singular detachment.I didn't feel that he was playing a part, he was too natural for that and his sincerity was obvious；I felt that there was something within him, I don't know whether to call it awareness or a sensibility or a force, that remained strangely aloof.

The children were brought in and made known to Larry, and gave him their polite little knicks. He held out his hand, looking at them with an engaging tenderness in his soft eyes, and they took it, staring at him gravely.Isabel brightly told him they were getting on nicely with their lessons, gave them a cookie each, and sent them away.

“I'll come and read to you for ten minutes when you're in bed.”

She did not at that moment want to be interrupted in her pleasure at seeing Larry. The little girls went up to say good night to their father.It was charming to see the love that lit up the red face of that gross man as he took them in his arms and kissed them.No one could help seeing that he proudly adored them and when they were gone he turned to Larry and with a sweet slow smile on his lips said：

“They're not bad kids, are they?”

Isabel gave him an affectionate glance.

“If I let Gray have his way he'd spoil them to death. He'd let me starve, that great brute would, to feed the children on caviare and pâté de foie gras.”

He looked at her with a smile and said：“You're a liar and you know it. I worship the ground you tread on.”

There was a responsive smile in Isabel's eyes. She knew that and was glad of it.A happy couple.

She insisted that we should stay to dinner. I, thinking they would prefer to be by themselves, made excuses, but she would not listen to them.

“I'll tell Marie to put another carrot in the soup and there'll be plenty for four. There's a chicken, and you and Gray can eat the legs while Larry and I eat the wings, and she can make the soufflé large enough for all of us.”

Gray too seemed to want me to stay, so I let myself be persuaded to do what I wanted to.

While we waited Isabel told Larry at length what I had already told him in brief. Though she narrated the lamentable story as gaily as possible Gray's face assumed an expression of sullen melancholy.She tried to cheer him up.

“Anyhow, it's all over now. We've fallen on our feet and we've got the future before us.As soon as things improve, Gray's going to get a splendid job and make millions.”

Cocktails were brought in and a couple did something to raise the poor fellow's spirits. I saw that Larry, though he took one, scarcely touched it, and when Gray, unobservant, offered him another he refused.We washed our hands and sat down to dinner.Gray had ordered a bottle of champagne, but when the butler began to fill Larry's glass he told him he didn't want any.

“Oh, but you must have some，”cried Isabel.“It's Uncle Elliott's best and he only gives it to very special guests.”

“To tell you the truth I prefer water. After having been in the East so long it's a treat to drink water that's safe.”

“This is an occasion.”

“All right, I'll drink a glass.”

The dinner was excellent, but Isabel noticed, as I did too, that Larry ate very little. It struck her, I suppose, that she had been doing all the talking and that Larry had had no chance to do more than listen, so now she began to question him on his actions during the ten years since she had seen him.He answered with his cordial frankness, but so vaguely as not to tell us much.

“Oh, I've been loafing around, you know. I spent a year in Germany and some time in Spain and Italy.And I knocked about the East for a bit.”

“Where have you just come from now?”

“India.”

“How long were you there?”

“Five years.”

“Did you have fun?”asked Gray.“Shoot any tigers?”

“No，”Larry smiled.

“What on earth were you doing with yourself in India for five years?”said Isabel.

“Playing about，”he answered, with a smile of kindly mockery.

“What about the Rope Trick?”asked Gray.“Did you see that?”

“No, I didn't.”

“What did you see?”

“A lot.”

I put a question to him then.

“Is it true that the Yogis acquire powers that would seem to us supernatural?”

“I wouldn't know. All I can tell you is that it's commonly believed in India.But the wisest don't attach any importance to powers of that sort；they think they're apt to hinder spiritual progress.I remember one of them telling me of a Yogi who came to the bank of a river；he hadn't the money to pay the ferryman to take him across and the ferryman refused to take him for nothing, so he stepped on the water and walked upon its surface to the other side.The Yogi who told me shrugged his shoulders rather scornfully.‘A miracle like that，’he said，‘is worth no more than the penny it would have cost to go on the ferryboat.’”

“But d'you think the Yogi really walked over the water?”asked Gray.

“The Yogi who told me believed it implicitly.”

It was a pleasure to hear Larry talk, because he had a wonderfully melodious voice；it was light, rich without beingdeep, and with a singular variety of tone. We finished dinner and went back to the drawing-room to have our coffee.I had never been to India and was eager to hear more of it.

“Did you come in contact with any writers and thinkers?”I asked.

“I notice that you make a distinction between the two，”said Isabel to tease me.

“I made it my business to，”Larry answered.

“How did you communicate with them?In English?”

“The most interesting, if they spoke at all, didn't speak it very well and understood less. I learnt Hindustani.And when I went south I picked up enough Tamil to get along pretty well.”

“How many languages d'you know now, Larry?”

“Oh, I don't know. Half a dozen or so.”

“I want to know more about the Yogis，”said Isabel.“Did you get to know any of them intimately?”

“As intimately as you can know persons who pass the best part of their time in the Infinite，”he smiled.“I spent two years in the Ashrama of one.”

“Two years?What's an Ashrama?”

“Well, I suppose you might call it a hermitage. There are holy men who live alone, in a temple, in the forest, or on the slopes of the Himalayas.There are others who attract disciples.A charitable person to acquire merit builds a room, large or small, to lodge a Yogi whose piety has impressed him, and the disciples live with him, sleeping on the veranda or in the cookhouse if there is one or under the trees.I had a tiny hut in the compound just big enough for my camp bed, a chair and a table, and a bookshelf.”

“Where was this?”I inquired.

“In Travancore, a beautiful country of green hills and valleys and soft-flowing rivers. Up in the mountains there are tigers, leopards, elephants, and bison, but the Ashrama was on a lagoon and all around it grew coconuts and areca palms.It was three or four miles from the nearest town, but people used to come from there, and even from much farther, on foot or by bullock cart, to hear the Yogi talk when he was inclined to, or just to sit at his feet and share with one another the peace and blessedness that were radiated from his presence as fragrance is wafted upon the air by a tuberose.”

Gray moved uneasily in his chair. I guessed that the conversation was taking a turn that he found uncomfortable.

“Have a drink?”he said to me.

“No, thanks.”

“Well, I'm going to have one. What about you Isabel?”

He raised his great weight from the chair and went over to the table on which stood whisky and Perrier and glasses.

“Were there other white men there?”

“No. I was the only one.”

“How could you stand it for two years?”cried Isabel.

“They passed like a flash. I've spent days that seemed to be unconscionably longer.”

“What did you do with yourself all the time?”

“I read. I took long walks.I went out in a boat on the lagoon.I meditated.Meditation is very hard work；after two or three hours of it you're as exhausted as if you'd driven a car five hundred miles, and all you want to do is to rest.”

Isabel frowned slightly. She was puzzled and I'm not sure that she wasn't a trifle scared.I think she was beginning to have a notion that the Larry who had entered the room a few hours before, though unchanged in appearance and seemingly as open and friendly as he had ever been, was not the same as the Larry, so candid, easy, and gay, wilful to her mind but delightful, that she had known in the past.She had lost him before, and on seeing him again, taking him for the old Larry, she had a feeling that, however altered the circumstances, he was still hers；and now, as though she had sought to catch a sunbeam in her hand and it slipped through her fingers as she grasped it, she was a trifle dismayed.I had looked at her a good deal that evening, which was always a pleasant thing to do, and had seen the fondness in hereyes as they rested on his trim head, with the small ears close to the skull, and how the expression in them changed when they dwelt on his hollow temples and the thinness of his cheek.She glanced at his long lean hands, which notwithstanding their emaciation were strong and virile.Then her gaze lingered on his mobile mouth, well shaped, full without being sensual, and on his serene brow and clean-cut nose.He wore his new clothes not with the bandbox elegance of Elliott, but with a sort of loose carelessness as though he had worn them every day for a year.I felt that he aroused in Isabel motherly instincts I had never felt in her relation with her children.She was an experienced woman；he still looked a boy；and I seemed to read in her air the pride of a mother for her grown-up son because he is talking intelligently and others are listening to him as if he made sense.I don't think the import of what he said penetrated her consciousness.

But I was not done with my questioning.

“What was your Yogi like?”

“In person, d'you mean?Well, he wasn't tall, neither thin nor fat, palish brown in colour and clean-shaven, with close-cropped white hair. He never wore anything but a loincloth, and yet he managed to look as trim and neat and well dressed as a young man in one of Brooks Brothers'advertisements.”

“And what had he got that particularly attracted you?”

Larry looked at me for a full minute before answering. His eyes in their deep sockets seemed as though they were trying to pierce to the depths of my soul.

“Saintliness.”

I was slightly disconcerted by his reply. In that room, with its fine furniture, with those lovely drawings on the walls, the word fell like a plop of water that has seeped through the ceiling from an overflowing bath.

“We've read all about the saints, St. Francis, St.John of the Cross, but that was hundreds of years ago.I never thought it possible to meet one who was alive now.From the first time I saw him I never doubted that he was a saint.It was a wonderful experience.”

“And what did you gain from it?”

“Peace，”he said casually, with a light smile. Then, abruptly, he rose to his feet.“I must go.”

“Oh, not yet, Larry，”cried Isabel.“It's quite early.”

“Good night，”he said, smiling still, taking no notice of her expostulation. He kissed her on the cheek.“I'll see you again in a day or two.”

“where are you staying?I'll call you.”

“Oh, don't bother to do that. You know how difficult it is to get a call through in Paris, and in any case our telephone is generally out of order.”

I laughed inwardly at the neatness with which Larry had got out of giving an address. It was a queer kink of his to make a secret of his abode.I suggested that they should all dine with me next evening but one in the Bois de Boulogne.It was very pleasant in that balmy spring weather to eat out-of-doors, under the trees, and Gray could drive us there in the coupé.I left with Larry and would willingly have walked some way with him, but as we got into the street he shook hands with me and walked quickly off.I got into a taxi.

We had arranged to meet at the apartment and have a cocktail before starting. I arrived before Larry.I was taking them to a very smart restaurant and expected to find Isabel arrayed for the occasion；with all the women dressed up to the nines I was confident she would not wish to be outshone.But she had on a plain woollen frock.

“Gray's got one of his headaches，”she said.“He's in agony. I can't possibly leave him.I told the cook she could go out when she'd given the children their supper and I must make something for him myself and try to get him to take it.You and Larry had better go alone.”

“Is Gray in bed?”

“No, he won't ever go to bed when he has his headaches. God knows, it's the only place for him, but he won't.He's in the library.”

This was a little panelled room, brown and gold, that Elliott had found in an old château.The books were protected from anyone who wanted to read them by gilt latticework, and locked up, but this was perhaps as well, as they consisted for the most part of illustrated pornographic works of the eighteenth century.In their contemporary morocco, however, they made a very pretty effect.Isabel led me in.Gray was sitting humped up in a big leather chair, with picture papers scattered on the floor beside him.His eyes were closed and his usually red face had a grey pallor.It was evident that he was in great pain.He tried to get up, but I stopped him.

“Have you given him any aspirin?”I asked Isabel.

“That never does any good. I have an American prescription, but that doesn't help either.”

“Oh, don't bother, darling，”said Gray.“I shall be all right tomorrow.”He tried to smile.“I'm sorry to make such a nuisance of myself，”he said to me.“You all go out to the Bois.”

“I wouldn't dream of it，”said Isabel.“D'you think I should enjoy myself when I knew you were suffering the tortures of the damned?”

“Poor slut, I think she loves me，”said Gray, his eyes closed.

Then his face was suddenly contorted and you could almost see the lancinating pain that pierced his head. The door was softly opened and Larry stepped in.Isabel told him what was the matter.

“Oh, I am sorry，”he said, giving Gray a look of commiseration.“Isn't there anything one can do to relieve him?”

“Nothing，”said Gray, his eyes still closed.“The only thing you can any of you do for me is to leave me alone；go off and have a good time by yourselves.”

I thought myself that was the only sensible course to take, but I didn't suppose Isabel could square it with her conscience.

“Will you let me see if I can help you?”asked Larry.

“No one can help me，”said Gray wearily.“It's just killing me and sometimes I wish to God it would.”

“I was wrong in saying that perhaps I could help you. What I meant was that perhaps I could help you to help yourself.”

Gray slowly opened his eyes and looked at Larry.

“How can you do that?”

Larry took what looked like a silver coin out of his pocket and put it in Gray's hand.

“Close your fingers on it tightly and hold your hand palm downwards. Don't fight against me.Make no effort, but hold the coin in your clenched fist.Before I count twenty your hand will open and the coin will drop out of it.”

Gray did as he was told. Larry seated himself at the writing-table and began to count.Isabel and I remained standing.One, two, three, four.Till he got up to fifteen there was no movement in Gray's hand, then it seemed to tremble a little and I had the impression, I can hardly say I saw, that the clenched fingers were loosening.The thumb moved away from the fist.

I distinctly saw the fingers quiver. When Larry reached nineteen the coin fell out of Gray's hand and rolled to my feet.I picked it up and looked at it.It was heavy and misshapen, and in bold relief on one side of it was a youthful head which I recognized as that of Alexander the Great.Gray stared at his hand with perplexity.

“I didn't let the coin drop，”he said.“It fell of itself.”

He was sitting with his right arm resting on the arm of the leather chair.

“Are you quite comfortable in that chair?”asked Larry.

“As comfortable as I can be when my head's giving me hell.”

“Well, let yourself go quite slack. Take it easy.Do nothing.Don't resist.Before I count twenty your right arm will rise from the arm of the chair until your hand is above your head.One, two, three, four.”

He spoke the numbers slowly in that silver-toned, melodious voice of his, and when he had reached nine we saw Gray's hand rise, only just perceptibly, from the leather surface on which it rested until it was perhaps an inch above it. It stopped for a second.

“Ten, eleven, twelve.”

There was a little jerk and then slowly the whole arm began to move upwards. It wasn't resting on the chair any more.Isabel, a little scared, took hold of my hand.It was a curious effect.It had no likeness to a voluntary movement.I've never seen a man walking in his sleep, but I can imagine that he would move in just the same strange way that Gray's arm moved.It didn't look as though the will were the motive power.I should have thought it would be hard to raise the arm so slowly and so evenly by a conscious effort.It gave the impression that a subconscious force, independent of the mind, was raising it.It was the same sort of movement as that of a piston moving very slowly back and forth in a cylinder.

“Fifteen, sixteen, seventeen.”

The words fell, slow, slow, slow, like drops of water in a basin from a defective tap. Gray's arm rose, rose, till his hand was above his head, and as Larry reached the number he had said it fell of its own weight on to the arm of the chair.

“I didn't lift my arm，”said Gray.“I couldn't help its rising like that. It did it of its own accord.”

Larry faintly smiled.

“It's of no consequence. I thought it might give you confidence in me.Where's that Greek coin?”

I gave it to him.

“Hold it in your hand.”Gray took it. Larry glanced at his watch.“It's thirteen minutes past eight.In sixty seconds your eyelids will grow so heavy that you'll be obliged to close them and then you'll sleep.You'll sleep for six minutes.At eight-twenty you'll wake and you’ll have no more pain.”

Neither Isabel nor I spoke. Our eyes were on Larry.He said nothing more.He fixed his gaze on Gray, but did not seem to look at him；he seemed rather to look through and beyond him.There was something eerie in the silence that fell upon us；it was like the silence of flowers in a garden at nightfall.Suddenly I felt Isabel's hand tighten.I glanced at Gray.His eyes were closed.He was breathing easily and regularly；he was asleep.We stood there for a time that seemed interminable.I badly wanted a cigarette, but did not like to light one.Larry was motionless.His eyes looked into I knew not what distance.Except that they were open he might have been in a trance.Suddenly he appeared to relax；his eyes took on their normal expression and he looked at his watch.As he did so, Gray opened his eyes.

“Gosh，”he said，“I believe I dropped off to sleep.”Then he started. I noticed that his face had lost its ghastly pallor.“My headache's gone.”

“That's fine，”said Larry.“Have a cigarette and then we'll all go out to dinner.”

“It's a miracle. I feel perfectly swell.How did you do it?”

“I didn't do it. You did it yourself.”

Isabel went to change and meanwhile Gray and I drank a cocktail. Though it was plain that Larry did not wish it, Gray insisted on talking of what had just happened.He couldn't make it out at all.

“I didn't believe you could do a thing, you know，”he said.“I just gave in because I felt too lousy to argue.”

He went on to describe the onset of his headaches, the anguish he endured and the wreck he was when the attack subsided. He could not understand how it was that just then he felt his usual robust self.Isabel came back.She was wearing a dress I had not seen before；it reached to the ground, a white sheath of what I think is called marocain, with a flare of black tulle, and I could not but think she would be a credit to us.

It was very gay at the Château de Madrid and we were in high spirits.Larry talked amusing nonsense in a way I had not heard him do before and he made us laugh.I had a notion he was doing this with the idea of diverting our minds from the exhibition of his unexpected power.But Isabel was a determined woman.She was prepared to play ball with him as long as it suited her convenience, but she did not lose sight of her desire to satisfy her curiosity.When we hadfinished dinner and were drinking coffee and liqueurs and she might well have supposed that the good food, the one glass of wine he drank, and the friendly talk had weakened his defences she fixed her bright eyes on Larry.

“Now tell us how you cured Gray's headache.”

“You saw for yourself，”he answered, smiling.

“Did you learn to do that sort of thing in India?”

“Yes.”

“He suffers agonies. D'you think you could cure him permanently?”

“I don't know. I might be able to.”

“It would make a difference to his whole life. He couldn't expect to hold a decent job when he may be incapacitated for forty-eight hours.He'll never be happy till he's at work again.”

“I can't work miracles, you know.”

“But it was a miracle. I saw it with my own eyes.”

“No, it wasn't. I merely put an idea in old Gray's head and he did the rest himself.”He turned to Gray.“What are you doing tomorrow?”

“Playing golf.”

“I'll look in at six and We'll have a talk.”Then, giving Isabel his winning smile：“I haven't danced with you for ten years, Isabel. Would you care to see if I still know how to?”

After that we saw a good deal of Larry. For the next week he came to the apartment every day and for half an hour shut himself up with Gray in the library.It appeared that he wanted to persuade him-that was how he smil-ingly put it-out of having those shattering megrims, and Gray conceived a child-like trust in him.From the little Gray said I got the idea that he was trying besides to restore his broken confidence in himself.About ten days later Gray had another headache, and it so happened that Larry was not to come till the evening.It was not a very bad one, but Gray was so confident now in Larry's odd power that he thought if Larry could be got hold of he could take it away in a few minutes.But neither I, whom Isabel called on the phone, nor they knew where he lived.When Larry at last came and relieved Gray of his pain, Gray asked him for his address so that in case of need he could summon him at once.Larry smiled.

“Call the American Express and leave a message. I'll call them every morning.”

Isabel asked me later why Larry made a secret of his address. He had done that before and then it had turned out that he lived without any mystery in a third-rate hotel in the Latin Quarter.

“I haven't a notion，”I said in answer.“I can only suggest something very fanciful and there's probably nothing in it. It may be that some queer instinct urges him to carry over to his dwelling-place some privacy of his spirit.”

“What in God's name d'you mean by that?”she cried irritably.

“Hasn't it struck you that when he's with us, easy as he is to get on with, friendly and sociable, one's conscious of a sort of detachment in him, as though he weren't giving all of himself, but withheld in some hidden part of his soul something, I don't know what it is-a tension, a secret, an aspiration, a knowledge-that sets him apart?”

“I've known Larry all my life，”she said impatiently.”

Sometimes he reminds me of a great actor playing perfectly a part in a trumpery play. Like Eleanora Duse in La Locandiera.”

Isabel pondered over this for a moment.

“I suppose I know what you mean. One's having fun, and one thinks he's just like one of us, just like everybody else, and then suddenly you have the feeling that he's escaped you like a smoke ring that you try to catch in your hands.What do you think it can be that makes him so queer?”

“Perhaps something so commonplace that one simply doesn't notice it.”

“Such as?”

“Well, goodness, for instance.”

Isabel frowned.

“I wish you wouldn't say things like that. It gives me a nasty feeling in the pit of my stomach.”

“Or is it a little pain in the depth of your heart?”

Isabel gave me a long look as though she were trying to read my thoughts. She took a cigarette from the table beside her and, lighting it, leant back in her chair.She watched the smoke curl up into the air.

“Do yon want me to go?”I asked.

“No.”

I was silent for a moment, watching her, and I took my pleasure in the contemplation of her shapely nose and the exquisite line of her jaw.

“Are you very much in love with Larry?”

“God damn you, I've never loved anyone else in all my life.”

“Why did you marry Gray?”

“I had to marry somebody. He was mad about me and Mamma wanted me to marry him.Everybody told me I was well rid of Larry.I was very fond of Gray；I'm very fond of him still.You don't know how sweet he is.No one in the world could be so kind and so considerate.He looks as though he had an awful temper, doesn't he?With me he's always been angelic.When we had money, he wanted me to want things so that he could have the pleasure of giving them to me.Once I said it would be fun if we could have a yacht and go round the world, and if the crash hadn't come he’d have bought one.”

“He sounds almost too good to be true，”I murmured.

“We had a grand time. I shall always be grateful to him for that.He made me very happy.”

I looked at her but did not speak.

“I suppose I didn't really love him, but one can get on all right without love. At the bottom of my heart I hankered for Larry, but as long as I didn't see him it didn't really bother me.D'you remember saying to me that with three thousand miles of ocean between, the pangs of love become quite tolerable?I thought it a cynical remark then, but of course it's true.”

“If it's a pain to see Larry, don't you think it would be wiser not to see him?”

“But it's a pain that's heaven. Besides, you know what he is.Any day he may vanish like a shadow when the sun goes in and we may not see him again for years.”

“Have you never thought of divorcing Gray?”

“I've got no reason for divorcing him.”

“That doesn't prevent your countrywomen from divorcing their husbands when they have a mind to.”

She laughed.

“Why d'you suppose they do it?”

“Don't you know?Because American women expect to find in their husbands a perfection that English women only hope to find in their butlers.”

Isabel gave her head such a haughty toss that I wondered she didn't get a crick in the neck.

“Because Gray isn't articulate you think there's nothing to him.”

“You're wrong there，”I interrupted quickly.“I think there's something rather moving about him. He has a wonderful faculty of love.One has only to glance at his face when he's looking at you to see how deeply, how devotedly he's attached to you.He loves his children much more than you do.”

“I suppose you're going to say now that I'm not a good mother.”

“On the contrary I think you're an excellent mother. You see that they're well and happy.You watch over their diet and take care that their bowels act regularly.You teach them to behave nicely and you read to them and make themsay their prayers.If they were sick you'd send for a doctor at once and nurse them with care.But you're not wrapped up in them as Gray is.”

“It's unnecessary that one should be. I'm a human being and I treat them as human beings.A mother only does her children harm if she makes them the only concern of her life.”

“I think you're quite right.”

“And the fact remains that they worship me.”

“I've noticed that. You're their ideal of all that's graceful and beautiful and wonderful.But they're not cosy and at their ease with you as they are with Gray.They worship you, that's true；but they love him.”

“He's very lovable.”

I liked her for saying that. One of her most amiable traits was that she was never affronted by the naked truth.

“After the crash Gray went all to pieces. For weeks he worked at the office till midnight.I used to sit at home in an agony of fear, I was afraid he'd blow his brains out, he was so ashamed.You see, they'd been so proud of the firm, his father and Gray, they were proud of their integrity and the sureness of their judgement.It wasn't so much that we'd lost all our money, what he couldn't get over was that all those people who’d trusted him had lost theirs.He felt that he ought to have had more foresight.I couldn’t get him to see that he wasn’t to blame.”

Isabel took a lipstick out of her bag and painted her lips.

“But that's not what I wanted to tell you. The one thing we had left was the plantation and I felt that the only chance for Gray was to get away, so we parked the children with Mamma and went down there.He'd always liked it, but we'd never been there by ourselves；we'd taken a crowd with us and had a grand time.Gray's a good shot, but he hadn’t the heart to shoot then.He used to take a boat and go out on the marsh by himself for hours at a time and watch the birds.He’d wander up and down the canals with the pale rushes on each side of him and only the blue sky above.On some days the canals are as blue as the Mediterranean.He used not to say much when he came back.He’d say it was swell.But I could see what he felt.I knew that his heart was moved by the beauty and the vastness and the stillness.There’s a moment just before sunset when the light on the marsh is lovely.He used to stand and look at it and it filled him with bliss.He took long rides in those solitary, mysterious woods；they’re like the woods in a play of Maeterlinck’s, so grey, so silent, it’s almost uncanny；and there’s a moment in spring-it hardly lasts more than a fortnight-when the dogwood bursts into flower, and the gum trees burst into leaf, and their young fresh green against the grey Spanish moss is like a song of joy；the ground is carpeted with great white lilies and wild azalea.Gray couldn’t say what it meant to him, but it meant the world.He was drunk with the loveliness of it.Oh, I know I don’t put it well, but I can’t tell you how moving it was to see that great hulk of a man uplifted by an emotion so pure and so beautiful that it made me want to cry.If there is a God in heaven Gray was very near Him then.”

Isabel had grown a trifle emotional while she told me this and taking a tiny handkerchief she carefully wiped away a tear that glistened at the corner of each eye.

“Aren't you romanticizing?”I said, smiling.“I have a notion that you're ascribing to Gray thoughts and emotions that you would have expected him to have.”

“How should I have seen them if they hadn't been there?You know what I am. I'm never really happy unless I feel the cement of a sidewalk under my feet and there are large plateglass windows all along the street with hats to look at and fur coats and diamond bracelets and gold-mounted dressing cases.”

I laughed and we were silent for a moment. Then she went back to what we had been talking of before.

“I'd never divorce Gray. We've been through too much together.And he's absolutely dependent upon me.It's rather flattering, you know, and it gives you a sense of responsibility.And besides……”

“Besides what?”

She gave me a sidelong glance and there was a roguish twinkle in her eyes. I had a notion she didn't quite know how I would take what she had in mind to say.

“He's wonderful in bed. We've been married for ten years and he's as passionate a lover as he was at the beginning.Didn't you say in a play once that no man wants the same woman longer than five years?Well, you didn't know what you were talking about.Gray wants me as much as when we were first married.He’s made me very happy in that way.Although you wouldn’t think it to look at me, I’m a very sensual woman.”

“You're quite wrong, I would think it.”

“Well, it's not an unattractive trait, is it?”

“On the contrary.”I gave her a searching look.“Do you regret you didn't marry Larry ten years ago?”

“No. It would have been madness.But of course if I'd known then what I know now I'd have gone away and lived with him for three months, and then I'd have got him out of my system for good and all.”

“I think it's lucky for you you didn't make the experiment；you might have found yourself bound to him by bonds you couldn't break.”

“I don't think so. it was merely a physical attraction.You know, often the best way to overcome desire is to satisfy it.”

“Has it ever struck you that you're a very possessive woman?you've told me that Gray has a deep strain of poetic feeling and you've told me that he's an ardent lover；and I can well believe that both mean a lot to you；but you haven't told me what means much more to you than both of them put together-your feeling that you hold him in the hollow of that beautiful but not so small hand of yours. Larry would always have escaped you.D’you remember that Ode of Keats’s?‘Bold Lover, never, never canst thou kiss, though winning near the goal.’”

“You often think you know a great deal more than you do，”she said, a trifle acidly.“There's only one way a woman holds a man and you know it. And let me tell you this：it's not the first time she goes to bed with him that counts, it's the second.If she holds him then she holds him for good.”

“You do pick up the most extraordinary bits of information.”

“I get around and I keep my eyes and ears open.”

“May I inquire how you acquired that one?”

She gave me her most teasing smile.

“From a woman I made friends with at a dress show. The vendeuse told me she was the smartest kept woman in Paris, so I made up my mind I'd get to know her.Adrienne de Troye.Ever heard of her?”

“Never.”

“How your education has been neglected！She's forty-five and not even pretty, but she looks much more distinguished than any of Uncle Elliott's duchesses. I sat down beside her and put on my impulsive little-American-girl act.I told her I had to speak to her because I'd never seen anyone more ravishing in my life.I told her she had the perfection of a Greek cameo.”

“The nerve you've got.”

“She was rather stiff at first and stand-offish, but I ran on in my simple naïve way and she thawed.Then we had quite a nice little chat.When the show was over I asked her if she wouldn’t come to lunch with me at the Ritz one day.I told her I’d always admired her wonderful chic.”

“Had you ever seen her before?”

“Never. She wouldn't lunch with me, she said they had such malicious tongues in Paris, it would compromise me, but she was pleased that I'd asked her, and when she saw my mouth quiver with disappointment she asked me if I wouldn't come and lunch with her in her house.She patted my hand when she saw I was simply overwhelmed by her affability.”

“And did you go?”

“Of course I went. She has a dear little house off the Avenue Foch and we were waited on by a butler who's the very image of George Washington.I stayed till four o'clock.We took our hair down and our stays off, and had a thorough girls'gossip.I learnt enough that afternoon to write a book.”

“Why don't you?It's just the sort of thing to suit the Ladies'Home Journal.”

“You fool，”she laughed.

I was silent for a moment. I pursued my thoughts.

“I wonder if Larry was ever really in love with you，”I said presently.

She sat up. Her expression lost its amenity.Her eyes were angry.

“What are you talking about?Of course he was in love with me. D'you think a girl doesn't know when a man's in love with her?”

“Oh, I dare say he was in love with you after a fashion. He didn't know any girl so intimately as he knew you.You'd played around together since you were children.He expected himself to be in love with you.He had the normal sexual instinct.It seemed such a natural thing that you should marry.There wouldn't have been any particular difference in your relations except that you lived under the same roof and went to bed together.'

Isabel, to some extent mollified, waited for me to go on and, knowing that women are always glad to listen when you discourse upon love, I went on.

“Moralists try to persuade us that the sexual instinct hasn't got so very much to do with love. They're apt to speak of it as if it were an epiphenomenon.”

“What in God's name is that?”

“Well there are psychologists who think that consciousness accompanies brain processes and is determined by them, but doesn't itself exert any influence on them. Something like the reflection of a tree in water；it couldn't exist without the tree, but it doesn't in any way affect the tree.I think it's all stuff and nonsense to say that there can be love without passion；when people say love can endure after passion is dead they're talking of something else, affection, kindliness, community of taste and interest, and habit.Especially habit.Two people can go on having sexual intercourse from habit in just the same way as they grow hungry at the hour they’re accustomed to have their meals.Of course there can be desire without love.Desire isn’t passion.Desire is the natural consequence of the sexual instinct and it isn’t of any more importance than any other function of the human animal.That’s why women are foolish to make a song and dance if their husbands have an occasional flutter when the time and the place are propitious.”

“Does that apply only to men?”

I smiled.

“If you insist I'll admit that what is sauce for the gander is sauce for the goose. The only thing to be said against it is that with a man a passing connexion of that sort has no emotional significance, while with a woman it has.”

“It depends on the woman.”

I wasn't going to let myself be interrupted.

“Unless love is passion, it's not love, but something else；and passion thrives not on satisfaction, but on impediment. What d'you suppose Keats meant when he told the lover on his Grecian urn not to grieve?‘Forever wilt thou love, and she be fair！'Why?Because she was unattainable, and however madly the lover pursued she still eluded him.For they were both imprisoned in the marble of what I suspect was an indifferent work of art.Your love for Larry and his for you were as simple and natural as the love of Paolo and Francesca or Romeo and Juliet.Fortunately for you it didn't come to a bad end.You made a rich marriage and Larry roamed the world to find out what song the Sirens sang.Passion didn't enter into it.”

“How d'you know?”

“Passion doesn't count the cost. Pascal said that the heart has its reasons that reason takes no account of.If he meant what I think, he meant that when passion seizes the heart it invents reasons that seem not only plausible but conclusive to prove that the world is well lost for love.It convinces you that honour is well sacrificed and that shame is a cheap price to pay.Passion is destructive.It destroyed Antony and Cleopatra, Tristan and Isolde, Parnell and Kitty O'shea.And if it doesn't destroy it dies.It may be then that one is faced with the desolation of knowing that one has wasted the years of one's life, that one's brought disgrace upon oneself, endured the frightful pang of jealousy, swallowed every bitter mortification, that one’s expended all one’s tenderness, poured out all the riches of one’s soul ona poor drab, a fool, a peg on which one hung one’s dreams, who wasn’t worth a stick of chewing gum.”

Before I finished this harangue I knew very well that Isabel wasn't paying any attention to me, but was occupied with her own reflections. But her next remark surprised me.

“Do you think Larry is a virgin?”

“My dear, he's thirty-two.”

“I'm certain he is.”

“How can you be?”

“That's the kind of thing a woman knows instinctively.”

“I knew a young man who had a very prosperous career for some years by convincing one beautiful creature after another that he'd never had a woman. He said it worked like a charm.”

“I don't care what you say. I believe in my intuition.”

It was growing late, Gray and Isabel were dining with friends, and she had to dress. I had nothing to do, so I walked in the pleasant spring evening up the Boulevard Raspail.I have never believed very much in women's intuition；it fits in too neatly with what they want to believe to persuade me that it is trustworthy；and as I thought of the end of my long talk with Isabel I couldn't help but laugh.It put me in mind of Suzanne Rouvier and it occurred to me that I hadn't seen her for several days.I wondered if she was doing anything.If not, she might like to dine with me and go to a movie.I stopped a prowling taxi and gave the address of her apartment.

I mentioned Suzanne Rouvier at the beginning of this book. I had known her for ten or twelve years and at the date which I have now reached she must have been not far from forty.She was not beautiful；in fact she was rather ugly.She was tall for a Frenchwoman, with a short body, long legs, and long arms, and she held herself gawkily as though she didn't know how to cope with the length of her limbs.The colour of her hair changed according to her whim, but most often it was a reddish brown.She had a small square face, with very prominent cheekbones vividly rouged, and a large mouth with heavily-painted lips.None of this sounds attractive, but it was；it is true that she had a good skin, strong white teeth, and big, vividly blue eyes.They were her best feature, and she made the most of them by painting her eyelashes and her eyelids.She had a shrewd, roving, friendly look and she combined great good nature with a proper degree of toughness.In the life she had led she needed to be tough.Her mother, the widow of a small official in the government, had on his death returned to her native village in Anjou to live on her pension, and when Suzanne was fifteen she apprenticed her to a dress-maker in the neighbouring town, which was near enough for her to be able to come home on Sundays.It was during her fortnight's holiday, when she had reached the age of seventeen, that she was seduced by an artist who was spending his summer in the village to paint landscape.She already knew very well that without a penny to bless herself with her chance of marriage was remote and when the painter, at the end of the summer, proposed taking her to Paris she consented with alacrity.He took her to live with him in a rabbit-warren of studios in Montmartre, and she spent a very pleasant year in his company.At the end of this he told her that he had not sold a single canvas and could no longer afford the luxury of a mistress.She had been expecting the news for some time and was not disconcerted by it.He asked her if she wanted to go home and when she said she didn't, told her that another painter in the same block would be glad to have her.The man he named had made a pass at her two or three times and though she had rebuffed him it had been with so much good humour that he was not affronted.She did not dislike him and so accepted the proposition with placidity.It was convenient that she did not have to go to the expense of taking a taxi to transport her trunk.Her second lover, a good deal older than the first, but still presentable, painted her in every conceivable position, clothed and in the nude；and she passed two happy years with him.She was proud to think that with her as a model he had made his first real success and she showed me a reproduction cut out of an illustrated paper of the picture that had brought it about.It had been purchased by an American gallery.It was a nude, life-size, and shewas lying in something of the same position as Manet's Olympe.The artist had been quick to see that there was something modern and amusing in her proportions, and, fining down her thin body to emaciation, he had elongated her long legs and arms, he had emphasized her high cheekbones and made her blue eyes extravagantly large.From the reproduction I naturally could not tell what the colour was like, but I was sensible of the elegance of the design.The picture brought him sufficient notoriety to enable him to marry an admiring widow with money, and Suzanne, well aware that a man had to think of his future, accepted the rupture of their cordial relations without acrimony.

For by now she knew her value. She liked the artistic life, it amused her to pose, and after the day's work was over she found it pleasant to go to the café and sit with painters, their wives and mistresses, while they discussed art, reviled dealers, and told bawdy stories.On this occasion, having seen the break coming, she had made her plans.She picked out a young man who was unattached and who, she thought, had talent.She chose her opportunity when he was alone at the café，explained the circumstances, and without further preamble suggested that they should live together.

“I'm twenty and a good housekeeper. I'll save you money there and I'll save you the expense of a model.Look at your shirt, it's a disgrace, and your studio is a mess.You want a woman to look after you.”

He knew she was a good sort. He was amused at her proposal and she saw he was inclined to accept.

“After all, there's no harm in trying，”she said.“If it doesn't work we shall neither of us be worse off than we are now.”

He was a non-representative artist and he painted portraits of her in squares and oblongs. He painted her with one eye and no mouth.He painted her as a geometrical arrangement in black and brown and grey.He painted her in a criss-cross of lines through which you vaguely saw a human face.She stayed with him for a year and a half and left him of her own accord.

“Why?”I asked her.“Didn't you like him?”

“Yes, he was a nice boy. I didn't think he was getting any further.He was repeating himself.”

She found no difficulty in discovering a successor. She remained faithful to artists.

“I've always been in painting，”she said.“I was with a sculptor for six months, but I don't know why, it said nothing to me.”

She was pleased to think that she had never separated from a lover with unpleasantness. She was not only a good model, but a good housewife.She loved working about the studio she happened for a while to be living in and took pride in keeping it in apple-pie order.She was a good cook and could turn out a tasty meal at the smallest possible cost.She mended her lovers'socks and sewed buttons on their shirts.

“I never saw why because a man was an artist he shouldn't be neat and tidy.”

She only had one failure. This was a young Englishman who had more money than anyone she had known before and he had a car.

“But it didn't last long，”she said.“He used to get drunk and then he was tiresome. I wouldn't have minded that if he'd been a good painter, but, my dear, it was grotesque.I told him I was going to leave him and he began to cry.He said he loved me.

“‘My poor friend，'I said to him.‘Whether you love me or not isn't of the smallest consequence. What is of consequence is that you have no talent.Return to your own country and go into the grocery business.That is all you're fit for.'”

“What did he say to that?”I asked.

“He flew into a passion and told me to get out. But it was good advice I gave him, you know.I hope he took it, he wasn't a bad fellow；only a bad artist.”

Common sense and good nature will do a lot to make the pilgrimage of life not too difficult to a light woman, but the profession Suzanne had adopted had its ups and downs like any other. There was the Scandinavian for instance.She was so imprudent as to fall in love with him.

“He was a god, my dear，”she told me.“He was immensely tall, as tall as the Eiffel Tower, with great broadshoulders and a magnificent chest, a waist that you could almost put your hands round, a belly flat, but flat like the palm of my hand, and muscles like a professional athlete's. He had golden, wavy hair and a skin of honey.And he didn't paint badly.I liked his brush work, it was bold and dashing, and he had a rich vivid palette.”

She made up her mind to have a child by him. He was against it, but she told him she would take the responsibility.

‘He liked it well enough when it was born. Oh, such a lovely baby, rosy, fair-haired and blue-eyed like her papa.It was a girl.”

Suzanne lived with him for three years.

“He was a little stupid and sometimes he bored me, but he was very sweet and so beautiful that I didn't really mind.”

Then he got a telegram from Sweden to say his father was dying and he must come back at once. He promised to return, but she had a premonition that he never would.He left her all the money he had.She didn't hear from him for a month and then she got a letter from him saying that his father had died, leaving his affairs in confusion, and that he felt it his duty to remain by his mother and go into the lumber business.He enclosed a draft for ten thousand francs.Suzanne was not the woman to give way to despair.She came to the conclusion very quickly that a child would hamper her activities, so she took the baby girl down to her mother's and left her, along with the ten thousand francs, in her care.

“It was heart-rending, I adored that child, but in life one has to be practical.”

“What happened then?”I asked.

“Oh, I got along. I found a friend.”

But then came her typhoid. She always spoke of it as“my typhoid”as a millionaire might speak of“my place at Palm Beach”or“my grouse moor”.She nearly died of it and was in the hospital for three months.When she left she was nothing but skin and bone, as weak as a rat, and so nervous that she could do nothing but cry.She wasn't much use to anyone then, she wasn't strong enough to pose and she had very little money.

“Oh la, la，”she said，“I passed through some hard times. Luckily I had good friends.But you know what artists are, it's a struggle for them to make both ends meet, anyway.I was never a pretty woman, I had something of course, but I wasn't twenty any more.Then I ran into the cubist I'd been with；he'd been married and divorced since we lived together, he'd given up cubism and become a surrealist.He thought he could use me and said he was lonely；he said he’d give me board and lodgings and I promise you, I was glad to accept.”

Suzanne stayed with him till she met her manufacturer. The manufacturer was brought to the studio by a friend on the chance that he might buy one of the ex-cubist's pictures, and Suzanne, anxious to effect a sale, set herself out to be as agreeable to him as she knew how.He could not make up his mind to buy on the spur of the moment, but said he would like to come and see the pictures again.He did, a fortnight later, and this time she received the impression that he had come to see her rather than works of art.When he left, still without buying, he pressed her hand with unnecessary warmth.Next day the friend who had brought him waylaid her when she was on her way to market to buy the day's provisions and told her that the manufacturer had taken a fancy to her and wanted to know if she would dine with him next time he came to Paris, because he had a proposition to make to her.

“What does he see in me, d'you suppose?”she asked.

“He's an amateur of modern art. He's seen portraits of you.You intrigue him.He's a provincial and a business-man.You represent Paris to him, art, romance, everything that he misses in Lille.”

“Has he money?”she asked in her sensible way.

“Plenty.”

“Well, I'll dine with him. There's no harm hearing what he's got to say.”

He took her to Maxim's, which impressed her；she had dressed very quietly, and she felt as she looked at the women around her that she could pass very well for a respectable married woman. He ordered a bottle of champagne, and this persuaded her that he was a gentleman.When they came to coffee he put his proposition before her.Shethought it very handsome.He told her that he came to Paris regularly once a fortnight to attend a board meeting, and it was tiresome in the evening to dine alone and if he felt the need of feminine society to go to a brothel.Being a married man with two children, he thought that an unsatisfactory arrangement for a man in his position.Their common friend had told him all about her and he knew she was a woman of discretion.He was no longer young and he had no wish to get entangled with a giddy girl.He was something of a collector of the modern school and her connexion with it was sympathetic to him.Then he came down to brass tacks.He was prepared to take an apartment for her and furnish it and provide her with an income of two thousand francs a month.In return for this he wished to enjoy her company for one night every fourteen days.Suzanne had never had the spending of so much money in her life, and she quickly reckoned that on such a sum she could not only live and dress as such an advancement in the world evidently demanded, but provide for her daughter and put away something for a rainy day.But she hesitated for a moment.She had always been“in painting”，as she put it, and there was no doubt in her mind that it was a come-down to be the mistress of a businessman.

“C'est à prendre ou à laisser，”he said.“You can take it or leave it.”

He was not repulsive to her and the rosette of the Legion of Honour in his buttonhole proved that he was a man of distinction. She smiled.

“Je prends，”she replied.“I'll take it.”

Though Suzanne had always lived in Montmartre, she decided that it was necessary to break with the past, so she took an apartment in Montparnasse in a house just off the boulevard. It consisted of two rooms, a tiny kitchen, and a bathroom；it was on the sixth floor, but there was a lift.To her a bathroom and a lift, even though it only held two persons and moved at a snail's pace and you had to walk downstairs, represented not only luxury but style.

For the first few months of their union Monsieur Achille Gauvain, for such was his name, put up at a hotel on his fortnightly visits to Paris and, after spending such part of the night with Suzanne as his amorous inclina-tion demanded, returned to it to sleep by himself till it was time for him to get up and catch his train to return to his business affairs and the sober pleasures of family life；but then Suzanne pointed out to him that he was throwing away money to no purpose and it would be both more economical and more comfortable if he stayed in the apartment till morning. He could not but see the force of this.He was flattered at Suzanne's thoughtfulness for his comfort-it was true, there was nothing agreeable in going out into the street and finding a taxi on a cold winter night-and he approved of her disinclination to put him to useless expense.It was a good woman who counted not only her own pennies but her lover's.

Monsieur Achille had every reason to feel pleased with himself. In general they went to dine at one of the better restaurants in Montparnasse, but now and then Suzanne prepared dinner for him in the apartment.The tasty food she gave him was very much to his liking.On warm evenings he would dine in his shirt-sleeves and feel deliciously wanton and bohemian.He had always had an inclination for buying pictures, but Suzanne would let him buy nothing that she did not approve of, and he soon found reason to trust her judgement.She would have no truck with dealers, but took him to the studios of the painters and thus enabled him to buy pictures for half the money he would otherwise have had to pay.He knew that she was putting something aside, and when she told him that year by year she was buying a bit of land in her native village, he felt a thrill of pride.He knew the desire to own land that is in the heart of every person of French blood, and his esteem for her was increased because she possessed it too.

On her side Suzanne was well satisfied. She was neither faithful to him nor unfaithful；that is to say, she took care not to form any permanent connexion with another man, but if she came across one who took her fancy she was not averse from going to bed with him.But it was a point of honour with her not to let him stay all night.She felt she owed that to the man of means and position who had settled her life in such an assured and respectable manner.

I had come to know Suzanne when she was living with a painter who happened to be an acquaintance of mine andhad often sat in his studio while she posed；I continued to see her now and then at irregular intervals, but did not enter upon terms of any intimacy with her till she moved to Montparnasse. It appeared that Monsieur Achille, for this was how she always spoke of him and how she addressed him, had read one or two of my books in translation, and one evening he invited me to dine with them at a restaurant.He was a little man, half a head shorter than Suzanne, with iron-grey hair and a neat grey moustache.He was on the plump side, and he had a pot-belly, but only to the extent of giving him an air of substance.He walked with the short fat man's strut and it was plain that he was not displeased with himself.He gave me a fine dinner.He was very polite.He told me he was glad I was a friend of Suzanne's, he could see at a glance that I was comme il faut and he would be glad to think that I should see something of her.His affairs, alas！kept him tied to Lille and the poor girl was too often alone；it would be a comfort to him to know that she was in touch with a man of education.He was a businessman, but he had always admired artists.

“Ah, mon cher monsieur, art and literature have always been the twin glories of France. Along with her military prowess, of course.And I, a manufacturer of woollen goods, have no hesitation in saying that I put the painter and the writer on a level with the general and the statesman.”

No one could say handsomer than that.

Suzanne would not hear of having a maid to do the housework, partly for economy's sake and partly because（for reasons best known to herself）she didn't want anyone poking her nose into what was nobody's business but her own. She kept the tiny apartment, furnished in the most modern style of the moment, clean and neat, and she made all her own underclothes.But even then, now that she no longer posed, time hung heavily on her hands, for she was an industrious woman；and presently the idea occurred to her that, after having sat to so many painters, there was no reason why she should not paint too.She bought canvases, brushes, and paints and forthwith set to work.Sometimes when I was to take her out to dinner I would go early and find her in a smock busily at work.Just as the embryo in the womb recapitulates in brief the evolution of the species, so did Suzanne recapitulate the styles of all her lovers.She painted landscape like the landscape painter, abstractions like the cubist, and with the help of picture postcards sailing-boats lying at anchor like the Scandinavian.She could not draw, but she had an agreeable sense of colour, and if her pictures were not very good she got a lot of fun out of painting them.

Monsieur Achille encouraged her. It gave him a sense of satisfaction that his mistress should be an artist.It was on his insistence that she sent a canvas to the autumn salon and they were both very proud when it was hung.He gave her one bit of good advice.

“Don't try to paint like a man, my dear，”he said.“Paint like a woman. Don't aim to be strong；be satisfied to charm.And be honest.In business sharp practice sometimes succeeds, but in art honesty is not only the best but the only policy.”

At the time of which I write the connexion had lasted for five years to their mutual content.

“Evidently he doesn't thrill me，”said Suzanne.“But he's intelligent and in a good position. I've reached an age when it's necessary for me to think of my situation.”

She was sympathetic and understanding and Monsieur Achille conceived a high opinion of her judgement. She lent a willing ear when he discussed with her his business and domestic affairs.She condoled with him when his daughter failed in an examination and rejoiced with him when his son got engaged to a girl with money.He had himself married the only child of a man in his own line of business and the amalgamation of two rival firms had been a source of profit to both parties.It was naturally a satisfaction to him that his son was sensible enough to see that the soundest basis of a happy marriage is community of financial interests.He confided to Suzanne his ambition to marry his daughter into the aristocracy.

“And why not, with her fortune?”said Suzanne.

Monsieur Achille made it possible for Suzanne to send her own daughter to a convent where she would receive a good education, and he promised that at the proper age he would pay to have her suitably trained to earn her living as a typist and stenographer.

“She's going to be a beauty when she grows up，”Suzanne told me，“but evidently it won't hurt her to have an education and to be able to pound a typewriter. She's so young it's too soon to tell, but it may be that she'll have no temperament.”

Suzanne had delicacy. She left it to my intelligence to infer her meaning.I inferred it all right.

A week or so after I had so unexpectedly run into Larry, Suzanne and I one night, having dined together and gone to a movie, were sitting in the Sélect on the Boulevard du Montparnasse, having a glass of beer, when he strolled in.She gave a gasp and to my surprise called out to him.He came up to the table, kissed her, and shook hands with me.I could see that she could hardly believe her eyes.

“May I sit down?”he said.“I haven't had any dinner and I'm going to have something to eat.”

“Oh, but it's good to see you, mon petit，”she said, her eyes sparkling.“Where have you sprung from?And why have you given no sign of life all these years?My God, how thin you are！For all I knew you might have been dead.”

“Well, I wasn't，”he answered, his eyes twinkling.“How is Odette?”

That was the name of Suzanne's daughter.

“Oh, she's growing a big girl. And pretty.She still remembers you.”

“You never told me you knew Larry，”I said to her.

“Why should I?I never knew you knew him. We're old friends.”

Larry ordered himself eggs and bacon. Suzanne told him all about her daughter and then about herself.He listened in his smiling, charming way while she chattered.She told him that she had settled down and was painting.She turned to me.

“I'm improving, don't you think?I don't pretend I'm a genius, but I have as much talent as many of the painters I've known.”

“D'you sell any pictures?”asked Larry.

“I don't have to，”she answered airily.“I have private means.”

“Lucky girl.”

“No, not lucky：clever. You must come and see my pictures.”

She wrote down her address on a piece of paper and made him promise to go. Suzanne, excited, went on talking nineteen to the dozen.Then Larry asked for his bill.

“You're not going?”she cried.

“I am，”he smiled.

He paid and with a wave of the hand left us. I laughed.He had a way that always amused me of being with you one moment and without explanation gone the next.It was so abrupt；it was almost as if he had faded into the air.

“Why did he want to go away so quickly?”said Suzanne, with vexation.

“Perhaps he's got a girl waiting for him，”I replied mockingly.

“That's an idea like another.”She took her compact out of her bag and powdered her face.“I pity any woman who falls in love with him. Oh la la.”

“Why do you say that?”

She looked at me for a minute with a seriousness I had not often seen in her.

“I very nearly fell in love with him myself once. You might as well fall in love with a reflection in the water or a ray of sunshine or a cloud in the sky.I had a narrow escape.Even now when I think of it I tremble at the danger I ran.”

Discretion be blowed. It would have been inhuman not to want to know what this was all about.I congratulated myself that Suzanne was a woman who had no notion of reticence.

“How on earth did you ever get to know him?”I asked.

“Oh, it was years ago. Six years, seven years, I forget.Odette was only five.He knew Marcel when I was living with him.He used to come to the studio and sit while I was posing.He'd take us out to dinner sometimes.You never knew when he'd come.Sometimes not for weeks and then two or three days running.Marcel used to like to have him there；he said he painted better when he was there.Then I had my typhoid.I went through a bad time when I came out of the hospital.”She shrugged her shoulders.“But I've already told you all that.Well, one day I'd been round the studios trying to get work and no one wanted me, and I'd had nothing but a glass of milk and a croissant all day and I didn’t know how I was going to pay for my room, and I met him accidentally on the Boulevard Clichy.He stopped and asked me how I was and I told him about my typhoid, and then he said to me：‘You look as if you could do with a square meal.’And there was something in his voice and in the look of his eyes that broke me；I began to cry.

“We were next door to La Mère Mariette and he took me by the arm and sat me down at a table.I was so hungry I was ready to eat an old boot, but when the omelette came I felt I couldn’t eat a thing.He forced me to take a little and he gave me a glass of burgundy.I felt better then and I ate some asparagus.I told him all my troubles.I was too weak to hold a pose.I was just skin and bone and I looked terrible；I couldn’t expect to get a man.I asked him if he’d lend me the money to go back to my village.At least I’d have my little girl there.He asked me if I wanted to go, and I said of course not.Mamma didn’t want me, she could hardly live on her pension with prices the way they were, and the money I’d sent for Odette had all been spent, but if I appeared at the door she would hardly refuse to take me in, she’d see how ill I looked.He looked at me for a long time, and I thought he was going to say he couldn’t lend me anything.Then he said：

“‘Would you like me to take you down to a little place I know in the country, you and the kid?I want a bit of a holiday.'

“I could hardly believe my ears. I'd known him for ages and he'd never made a pass at me.

“‘In the condition I'm in?'I said. I couldn't help laughing.‘My poor friend，'I said，‘I'm no use to any man just now.’

“He smiled at me. Have you ever noticed what a wonderful smile he's got?It's as sweet as honey.

“‘Don't be so silly，'he said.‘I'm not thinking of that.'

“I was crying so hard by then, I could hardly speak. He gave me money to fetch the child and we all went to the country together.Oh, it was charming, the place he took us to.”

Suzanne described it to me. It was three miles from a little town the name of which I have forgotten, and they took a car out to the inn.It was a ramshackle building on a river with a lawn that ran down to the water.There were plane trees on the lawn and they had their meals in their shade.In summer artists came there to paint, but it was early for that yet and they had the inn to themselves.The fare was famous, and on Sundays people used to drive from here and there to lunch with abandon, but on week-days their peace was seldom disturbed.With the rest and the food and wine, Suzanne grew stronger, and she was happy to have her child with her.

“He was sweet with Odette and she adored him. I had to prevent her from making a nuisance of herself, but he never seemed to mind how much she pestered him.It used to make me laugh, they were like two children together.”

“What did you do with yourselves?”I asked.

“Oh, there was always something to do. We used to take a boat and fish and sometimes we'd get the patron to lend us his Citroën and we’d go into town.Larry liked it.The old houses and the place.It was so quiet that your footsteps on the cobblestones were the only sound you heard.There was a Louis Quatorze hôtel de ville and an old church, and at the edge of the town was the château with a garden by Le Nôtre.When you sat at the café on the place you had the feeling that you had stepped back three hundred years and the Citroën at the kerb didn’t seem to belong to this world at all.”

It was after one of these outings that Larry told her the story of the young airman which I narrated at the beginning of this book.

“I wonder why he told you，”I said.

“I haven't an idea. They'd had a hospital in the town during the war and in the cemetery there were rows and rowsof little crosses.We went to see it.We didn't stay long, it gave me the creeps-all those poor boys lying there.Larry was very silent on the way home.He never ate much, but at dinner he hardly touched a thing.I remember so well, it was a beautiful, starry night and we sat on the riverbank, it was pretty with the poplars silhouetted against the darkness, and he smoked his pipe.And suddenly，à propos de bottes, he told me about his friend and how he died to save him.”Suzanne took a swig of beer.“He’s a strange creature.I shall never understand him.He used to like to read to me.Sometimes in the daytime, while I sewed things for the little one, and in the evening after I’d put her to bed.”

“What did he read?”

“Oh, all sorts of things. Letters of Madame de Sévigné and bits of Saint-Simon.Imagine-toi, I who’d never read anything before but the newspaper and now and then a novel when I heard them talk about it in the studios and didn’t want them to think me a fool！I had no idea reading could be so interesting.Those old writers weren’t such fatheads as one would think.”

“Who would think?”I chuckled.

“Then he made me read with him. We read Phèdre and Bèrènice.He took the men’s parts and I took the women’s.You can’t think how amusing it was, she added naïvely.“He used to look at me so strangely when I cried at the pathetic parts.Of course it was only because I hadn’t got my strength.And you know, I’ve still got the books.Even now I can’t read some of the letters of Madame de Sévigné that he read to me without hearing his lovely voice and without seeing the river flowing so quietly and the poplars on the opposite bank, and sometimes I can’t go on, it gives me such a pain in my heart.I know now that those were the happiest weeks I ever spent in my life.That man, he’s an angel of sweetness.”

Suzanne felt she was growing sentimental and feared（wrongly）that I should laugh at her. She shrugged her shoulders and smiled.

“You know, I've always made up my mind that when I've reached the canonical age and no man wants to sleep with me any more I shall make my peace with the Church and repent of my sins. But the sins I committed with Larry nothing in the world will ever induce me to repent of.Never, never, never！”

“But as you've described it I can see nothing you can possibly have to repent of.”

“I haven't told you the half of it yet. You see, I have a naturally good constitution and being out in the air all day, eating well, sleeping well, with not a care in the world, in three or four weeks I was as strong as ever I'd been.And I was looking well；I had colour in my cheeks and my hair had recovered its sheen.I felt twenty.Larry swam in the river every morning and I used to watch him.He has a beautiful body, not an athlete's like my Scandinavian, but strong and of an infinite grace.

“He'd been very patient while I was so weak, but now that I was perfectly well I saw no reason to keep him waiting any longer. I gave him a hint or two that I was ready for anything, but he didn't seem to understand.Of course you Anglo-Saxons are peculiar, you're brutal and at the same time you're sentimental；there's no denying it, you’re not good lovers.I said to myself，‘Perhaps it’s his delicacy, he’s done so much for me, he’s let me have the child here, it may be that he hasn’t the heart to ask me for the return that is his right.’So one night, as we were going to bed, I said to him，‘D’you want me to come to your room tonight?’”

I laughed.

“You put it a bit bluntly, didn't you?”

“Well, I couldn't ask him to come to mine, because Odette was sleeping there，”she answered ingenuously.“He looked at me with those kind eyes of his for a moment, then he smiled.‘D'you want to come?'he said.

“‘What do you think-with that fine body of yours?'

“‘All right, come then.'

“I went upstairs and undressed and then I slipped along the passage to his room. He was lying in bed reading and smoking a pipe.He put down his pipe and his book and moved over to make room for me.”

Suzanne was silent for a while and it went against my grain to ask her questions. But after a while she went on.

“He was a strange lover. Very sweet, affectionate and even tender, virile without being passionate, if you understand what I mean, and absolutely without vice.He loved like a hot-blooded schoolboy.It was rather funny and rather touching.When I left him I had the feeling that I should be grateful to him rather than he to me.As I closed the door I saw him take up his book and go on reading from where he had left off.”

I began to laugh.

“I'm glad it amuses you，”she said a trifle grimly. But she was not without a sense of humour.She giggled.“I soon discovered that if I waited for an invitation I might wait indefinitely, so when I felt like it I just went into his room and got into bed.He was always very nice.He had in short natural human instincts, but he was like a man so preoccupied that he forgets to eat, yet when you put a good dinner before him he eats it with appetite.I know when a man's in love with me, and I should have been a fool if I'd believed that Larry loved me, but I thought he'd get into the habit of me.One has to be practical in life and I said to myself that it would suit me very well if when we went back to Paris he took me to live with him.I knew he'd let me have the child and I should have liked that.My instinct told me I’d be silly to fall in love with him, you know women are very unfortunate, so often when they fall in love they cease to be lovable, and I made up my mind to be on my guard.”

Suzanne inhaled the smoke of her cigarette and blew it out through her nose. It was growing late and many of the tables were now empty, but there was still a group of people hanging around the bar.

“One morning, after breakfast, I was sitting on the riverbank sewing, and Odette was playing with some bricks he'd bought her when Larry came up to me.

“‘I've come to say good-bye to you，'he said.

“‘Are you going somewhere?'I said, surprised.

“‘Yes.'

“‘Not for good?'I said.

“‘You're quite well now. Here's enough money to keep you for the rest of the summer and to start you off when you get back to Paris.'

“For a moment I was so upset I didn't know what to say. He stood in front of me, smiling in that candid way of his.

“‘Have I done something to displease you?'I asked him.

“‘Nothing. Don't think that for a moment.I've got work to do.We've had a lovely time down here.Odette, come and say good-bye to your uncle.'

“She was too young to understand. He took her up in his arms and kissed her；then he kissed me and walked back into the hotel；in a minute I heard the car drive away.I looked at the banknotes I had in my hand.Twelve thousand francs.It came so quickly I hadn't time to react.‘Zut alors，'I said to myself.I had at least one thing to be thankful for, I hadn't allowed myself to fall in love with him.But I couldn't make head or tail of it.”

I was obliged to laugh.

“You know, at one time I made quite a little reputation for myself as a humorist by the simple process of telling the truth. It came as such a surprise to most people that they thought I was being funny.”

“I don't see the connexion.”

“Well, Larry is, I think, the only person I've ever met who's completely disinterested. It makes his actions seem peculiar.We're not used to persons who do things simply for the love of God whom they don't believe in.”

Suzanne stared at me.

“My poor friend, you've had too much to drink.”





CHAPTER FIVE


1


I dawdled over my work in Paris. It was very agreeable in the springtime, with the chestnuts in the Champs Elysées in bloom and the light in the streets so gay.There was pleasure in the air, a light transitory pleasure, sensual without grossness, that made your step more springy and your intelligence more alert.I was happy in the various company of my friends and, my heart filled with amiable memories of the past, I regained in spirit at least some-thing of the glow of youth.I thought I should be a fool to allow work to interfere with a delight in the passing moment that I might never enjoy again so fully.

Isabel, Gray, Larry, and I went for excursions to places of interest within convenient distance. We went to Chantilly and Versailles, to St.Germain and Fontainebleau.Wherever we went, we lunched well and copiously.Gray ate largely to satisfy his enormous frame and was apt to drink a little too much.His health, whether owing to Larry's treatment or merely to the course of time, was certainly improved.He ceased to have racking headaches and his eyes were losing the look of bewilderment that when first I saw him on coming to Paris had been so distressing.He did not talk much except now and then to tell a long-winded story, but laughed with great loud guffaws at the nonsense Isabel and I talked.He enjoyed himself.Though not amusing, he was so good-humoured and so easily pleased that it was impossible not to like him.He was the kind of man with whom one would have hesitated to pass a lonely evening, but with whom one might cheerfully have looked forward to spending six months.

His love for Isabel was a delight to see；he adored her beauty and thought her the most brilliant, fascinating creature in the world；and his devotion, his doglike devotion to Larry was touching. Larry appeared to enjoy himself too；I had a notion that he looked upon this time as a holiday that he was taking from whatever projects he had in mind and was serenely making the most of it.He didn't talk very much either, but it didn't matter, his company was sufficient conversation；he was so easy, so pleasantly cheerful that you didn't ask more of him than what he gave, and I well knew that if the days we spent together were so happy it was due to his being with us.Though he never said a brilliant or a witty thing, we should have been dull without him.

It was on the return from one of these jaunts that I witnessed a scene that somewhat startled me. We had been to Chartres and were on our way back to Paris.Gray was driving and Larry was sitting beside him；Isabel and I were at the back.We were tired after the long day.Larry sat with his arm stretched out along the top of the front seat.His shirt-cuff was pulled back by his position and displayed his slim, strong wrist and the lower part of his brown arm lightly covered with fine hairs.The sun shone goldenly upon them.Something in Isabel's immobility attracted my attention, and I glanced at her.She was so still you might have thought her hypnotized.Her breath was hurried.Her eyes were fixed on the sinewy wrist with its little golden hairs and on that long, delicate, but powerful hand, and I have never seen on a human countenance such a hungry concupiscence as I saw then on hers.It was a mask of lust.I should never have believed that her beautiful features could assume an expression of such unbridled sensuality.It was animal rather than human.The beauty was stripped from her face；the look upon it made her hideous and frightening.It horribly suggested the bitch in heat and I felt rather sick.She was unconscious of my presence；she was conscious of nothing but the hand, lying along the rim so negligently, that filled her with frantic desire.Then as it were a spasm twitched across her face, she gave a shudder and shutting her eyes sank into the corner of the car.

“Give me a cigarette，”she said in a voice I hardly recognized, it was so raucous.

I got one out of my case and lit it for her. She smoked it greedily.For the rest of the drive she looked out of the window and never said a word.

When we arrived at their house Gray asked Larry to drive me back to my hotel and then take the car to the garage. Larry got into the driver's seat and I sat myself beside him.As they crossed the pavement Isabel took Gray's arm and, snuggling up to him, gave him a look which I could not see, but whose sense I could divine.I guessed that he would have a passionate bedfellow that night, but would never know to what prickings of conscience he owed her ardour.

June was approaching its end and I had to get back to the Riviera. Friends of Elliott's, who were going to America, had lent the Maturins their villa at Dinard and they were going there with the children as soon as their school closed.Larry was staying in Paris to work, but was buying himself a secondhand Citroën and had promised to spend a few days with them in August.On my last night in Paris I asked the three of them to dine with me.

It was on that night that we met Sophie Macdonald.





2


Isabel had conceived the desire to make a tour of the tough joints, and because I had some acquaintance with them she asked me to be their guide. I did not much like the notion, because in places of that sort in Paris they are apt to make their disapproval of sightseers from another world unpleasantly obvious.But Isabel insisted.I warned her that it would be very boring and begged her to dress plainly.We dined late, went to the Folies-Bergère for an hour, and then set out.I took them first to a cellar near Notre Dame frequented by gangsters and their molls where I knew the proprietor, and he made room for us at a long table at which were sitting some very disreputable people, but I ordered wine for all of them and we drank one another’s healths.It was hot, smoky, and dirty.Then I took them to the Sphynx where women, naked under their smart, tawdry evening dresses, their breasts, nipples and all, exposed, sit in a row on two benches opposite one another and when the band strikes up dance together listlessly with their eyes on the lookout for the men who sit round the dance hall at marble-topped tables.We ordered a bottle of warm champagne.Some of the women gave Isabel the eye as they passed us and I wondered if she knew what it meant.

Then we went on to the Rue de Lappe. It is a dingy, narrow street, and even as you enter it you get the impression of sordid lust.We went into a café.There was the usual young man, pale and dissipated, playing the piano, while another man, old and tired, scraped away on a fiddle, and a third made discordant noises on a saxophone.The place was packed and it looked as though there wasn’t a vacant table, but the patron, seeing that we were customers with money to spend, unceremoniously turned a couple out, making them take seats at a table already occupied, and settled us down.The two persons who were hustled away did not take it well, and they made remarks about us that were far from complimentary.A lot of people were dancing, sailors with the red pompon on their hats, men mostly with their caps on and handkerchiefs round their necks, women of mature age, and young girls, painted to the eyes, bareheaded, in short skirts and coloured blouses.Men danced with podgy boys with made-up eyes；gaunt, hard-featured women danced with fat women with dyed hair；men danced with women.There was a frowst of smoke and liquor and of sweating bodies.The music went on interminably and that unsavoury mob proceeded round the room, the sweat shining on their faces, with a solemn intensity in which there was something horrible.There were a few big men of brutal aspect, but for the most part they were puny and ill-nourished.I watched the three who were playing.They might have been robots, so mechanical was their performance, and I asked myself if it was possible that at one time, when they were setting out, they had thought they might be musicians whom people would come from far to hear and to applaud.Even to play the violin badly you must take lessons and practise：did that fiddler go to all that trouble just to play fox-trots till the small hours of the morning in that stinking squalor?The music stopped and the pianist wiped his face with a dirty handkerchief.The dancers slouched or sidled or squirmed back to their tables.Suddenly we heard an American voice：

“For Christ's sake.”

A woman got up from one of the tables across the room. The man she was with tried to stop her, but she pushed him aside and staggered across the floor.She was very drunk.She came up to our table and stood in front of us, swaying a little and grinning stupidly.She seemed to find the sight of us vastly amusing.I glanced at my companions.Isabel was staring at her blankly, Gray had a sullen frown on his face, and Larry gazed as though he couldn't believe hiseyes.

“Hello，”she said.

“Sophie，”said Isabel.

“Who the hell did you think it was?”she gurgled. She grabbed the waiter who was passing.“Vincent, fetch me a chair.”

“Fetch one yourself，”he said, snatching himself away.

“Salaud，”she cried, spitting at him.

“T'en fais pas, Sophie，”said a big fat fellow with a great head of greasy hair, who was sitting next to us in his shirt-sleeves.“Here's a chair.”

“Fancy meeting you all like this，”she said, still swaying.“Hello, Larry. Hello, Gray.”She sank into the chair which the man who had spoken placed behind her.“Let's all have a drink.Patron，”she screamed.

I had noticed that the proprietor had his eye on us and now he came up.

“You know these people, Sophie?”he asked, addressing her in the familiar second person singular.

“Ta gueule，”she laughed drunkenly.“They're my childhood friends. I'm buying a bottle of champagne for them.And don't you bring us any urine de cheval.Bring us something one can swallow without vomiting.”

“You're drunk, my poor Sophie，”he said.

“To hell with you.”

He went off, glad enough to sell a bottle of champagne-we for safety's sake had been drinking brandy and soda-and Sophie stared at me dully for a moment.

“Who's your friend, Isabel?”

Isabel told her my name.

“Oh?I remember, you came to Chicago once. Bit of a stuffed shirt, aren't you?”

“Maybe，”I smiled.

I had no recollection of her, but that was not surprising, since I had not been to Chicago for more than ten years and had met a great many people then and a great many since.

She was quite tall and, when standing, looked taller still, for she was very thin. She wore a bright green silk blouse, but it was crumpled and spotted, and a short black skirt.Her hair, cut short and loosely curled, but tousled, was brightly hennaed.She was outrageously made up, her cheeks rouged to the eyes, and her eyelids, upper and lower, heavily blued；her eyebrows and eyelashes were thick with mascara and her mouth scarlet with lipstick.Her hands, with their painted nails, were dirty.She looked more of a slut than any woman there and I had a suspicion that she was not only drunk but doped.But one couldn't deny that there was a certain vicious attractiveness about her；she held her head with an arrogant tilt and her make-up accentuated the startling greenness of her eyes.Sodden with drink as she was, she had a bold-faced shamelessness that I could well imagine appealed to all that was base in men.She embraced us in a sardonic smile.

“I can't say you seem so terribly pleased to see me，”she said.

“I heard you were in Paris，”said Isabel lamely, a chilly smile on her face.

“You might have called me. I'm in the phone-book.”

“We haven't been here very long.”

Gray came to the rescue.

“Are you having a good time over here, Sophie?”

“Fine. You went bust, Gray, didn't you?”

His face flushed a deeper red.

“Yes.”

“Tough on you. I guess it's pretty grim in Chicago right now.Lucky for me I got out when I did.For Christ's sake why doesn't that bastard bring us something to drink?”

“He's just coming，”I said, seeing the waiter threading his way through the tables with glasses and wine on a tray.

My remark drew her attention to me.

“My loving in-laws kicked me out of Chicago. Said I was gumming up their f-reputations.”She giggled savagely.“I'm a remittance man.”

The champagne came and was poured out. With a shaking hand she raised a glass to her lips.

“To hell with stuffed shirts，”she said. She emptied the glass and glanced at Larry.“You don't seem to have much to say for yourself, Larry.”

He had been looking at her with an impassive face. He had not taken his eyes off her since she had appeared.He smiled amiably.

“I'm not a very talkative guy.”

The music struck up again and a man came over to us. He was a tallish fellow and well built, with a great hooked nose, a mat of shining black hair, and great sensual lips.He looked like an evil Savonarola.Like most of the men there he wore no collar and his tight-fitting coat was closely buttoned to give him a waist.

“Come on, Sophie. We're going to dance.”

“Go away. I'm busy.Can't you see I'm with friends?”

“J'm'en fous de tes amis. To hell with your friends.You're dancing.”

He took hold of her arm but she snatched it away.

“Fous-moi la paix, espèce de con，”she cried, with sudden violence.

“Merde.”

“Mange.”

Gray did not understand what they were saying, but I saw that Isabel, with that strange knowledge of obscenity that the most virtuous woman seems to possess, understood perfectly, and her face went hard with a frown of disgust. The man raised his arm with his hand open, the horny hand of a workman, and was about to slap her, when Gray half raised himself from his chair.

“Allaiz vous ong，”he shouted, with his execrable accent.

The man stopped and threw Gray a furious glance.

“Take care, Coco，”said Sophie, with a bitter laugh.“He'll lay you out cold.”

The man took in Gray's great height and weight and strength. He shrugged his shoulders sullenly and, throwing a filthy word at us, slunk off.Sophie giggled drunkenly.The rest of us were silent.I refilled her glass.

“You living in Paris, Larry?”she asked after she had drained it.

“For the present.”

It's always difficult to make conversation with a drunk, and there's no denying it, the sober are at a disadvantage with him. We went on talking for a few minutes in a dreary, embarrassed way.Then Sophie pushed back her chair.

“If I don't go back to my boy friend he'll be as mad as hell. He's a sulky brute, but Christ, he's a good screw.”She staggered to her feet.“So long, folks.Come again.I'm here every night.”

She pushed her way through the dancers and we lost sight of her in the crowd. I almost laughed at the icy scorn on Isabel's classic features.None of us said a word.

“This is a foul place，”said Isabel suddenly.“Let's go.”

I paid for our drinks and for Sophie's champagne and we trooped out. The crowd was on the dance floor and we got out without remark.It was after two, and to my mind time to go to bed, but Gray said he was hungry, so I suggested that we should go to Graf's in Montmartre and get something to eat.We were silent as we drove up.I sat beside Gray to direct him.We reached the garish restaurant.There were still people sitting on the terrace.We went in and ordered bacon and eggs and beer.Isabel, outwardly at least, had regained her composure.She congratulated me, somewhat ironically perhaps, on my acquaintance with the more disreputable parts of Paris.

“You asked for it，”I said.

“I've thoroughly enjoyed myself. I've had a grand evening.”

“Hell，”said Gray.“It stank. And Sophie.”

Isabel shrugged an indifferent shoulder.

“D'you remember her at all?”she asked me.“She sat next to you the first night you came to dinner with us. She hadn't got that awful red hair then.Its natural colour is dingy beige.”

I threw my mind back. I had a recollection of a very young girl with blue eyes that were almost green and an attractive tilt to her head.Not pretty, but fresh and ingenuous with a mixture of shyness and pertness that I found amusing.

“Of course I remember. I liked her name.I had an aunt called Sophie.”

“She married a boy called Bob Macdonald.”

“Nice fellow，”said Gray.

“He was one of the best-looking boys I ever saw. I never understood what he saw in her.She married just after I did.Her parents were divorced and her mother married a Standard Oil man in China.She lived with her father's people at Marvin and we used to see a lot of her then, but after she married she dropped out of our crowd somehow.Bob Macdonald was a lawyer, but he wasn't making much money, and they had a walk-up apartment on the North Side.But it wasn't that.They didn't want to see anybody.I never saw two people so crazy about one another.Even after they'd been married two or three years and had a baby they’d go to the pictures and he’d sit with his arm round her waist and she with her head on his shoulder just like lovers.They were quite a joke in Chicago.”

Larry listened to what Isabel said, but made no comment. His face was inscrutable.

“What happened then?”I asked.

“One night they were driving back to Chicago in a little open car of theirs, and they had the baby with them. They always had to take the baby along because they hadn't any help.Sophie did everything herself, and, any-way, they worshipped it.And a bunch of drunks in a great sedan driving at eighty miles an hour crashed into them head on.Bob and the baby were killed outright, but Sophie only had concussion and a rib or two broken.They kept it from her as long as they could that Bob and the baby were dead, but at last they had to tell her.They say it was awful.She nearly went crazy.She shrieked the place down.They had to watch her night and day and once she nearly succeeded in jumping out of the window.Of course we did all we could, but she seemed to hate us.After she came out of the hospital they put her in a sanatorium and she was there for months.'

“Poor thing.”

“When they let her go she started to drink, and when she was drunk she'd go to bed with anyone who asked her. It was terrible for her in-laws.They're very nice quiet people and they hated the scandal.At first we all tried to help her, but it was impossible；if you asked her to dine she'd arrive plastered and she was quite likely to pass out before the evening was over.Then she got in with a rotten crowd and we had to drop her.She was arrested once for driving a car when she was drunk.She was with a dago she'd picked up in a speak-easy and it turned out that he was wanted by the cops.”

“But had she money?”I asked.

“There was Bob's insurance；the people who owned the car that smashed into them were insured and she got something from them. But it didn't last long.She spent it like a drunken sailor and in two years she was broke.Her grandmother wouldn't have her back at Marvin.Then her in-laws said they'd make her an allowance if she'd go and live abroad.I suppose that’s what she’s living on now.”

“The wheel comes full circle，”I remarked.“There was a time when the black sheep of the family was sent from my country to America；now apparently he's sent from your country to Europe.”

“I can't help feeling sorry for her，”said Gray.

“Can't you?”said Isabel coolly.“I can. Of course it was a shock and no one could have sympathized with Sophie more than I did.We'd known one another always.But a normal person recovers from a thing like that.If she went topieces it's because there was a rotten streak in her.She was naturally unbalanced；even her love for Bob was exaggerated.If she'd had character she'd have been able to make something of life.”

“If pots and pans……Aren't you very hard, Isabel?”I murmured.

“I don't think so. I have common sense and I see no reason to be sentimental about Sophie.God knows, no one could be more devoted to Gray and the babes than I am, and if they were killed in a motor accident I should go out of my mind, but sooner or later I'd pull myself together.Isn't that what you'd wish me to do, Gray, or would you prefer me to get blind every night and go to bed with every apache in Paris?”

Gray then came as near to making a humorous remark as I ever heard him.

“Of course I'd prefer you to hurl yourself on my funeral pyre in a new Molyneux dress, but as that's not done any more, I guess the best thing you could do would be to take the bridge. And I'd like you to remember not to go an original no-trump on less than three and a half to four quick tricks.”

It was not the occasion for me to point out to Isabel that her love for her husband and her children, though sincere enough, was scarcely passionate. Perhaps she read the thought that was passing through my mind, for she addressed me somewhat truculently.

“What have you got to say?”

“I'm like Gray, I'm sorry for the girl.”

“She's not a girl. She's thirty.”

“I suppose it was the end of the world for her when her husband and her baby were killed. I suppose she didn't care what became of her and flung herself into the horrible degradation of drink and promiscuous copulation to get even with life that had treated her so cruelly.She'd lived in heaven and when she lost it she couldn't put up with the common earth of common men, but in despair plunged headlong into hell.I can imagine that if she couldn't drink the nectar of the gods any more she thought she might as well drink bathroom gin.”

“That's the sort of thing you say in novels. It's nonsense and you know it's nonsense.Sophie wallows in the gutter because she likes it.Other women have lost their husbands and children.It wasn't that that made her evil.Evil doesn't spring from good.The evil was there always.When that motor accident broke her defences it set her free to be herself.Don’t waste your pity on her；she’s now what at heart she always was.”

All this time Larry had remained silent. He seemed to be in a brown study and I thought he hardly heard what we were saying.Isabel's words were followed by a brief silence.He began to speak, but in a strange, toneless voice, as though not to us, but to himself；his eyes seemed to look into the dim distance of past time.

“I remember her when she was fourteen with her long hair brushed back off her forehead and a black bow at the back, with her freckled, serious face. She was a modest, high-minded, idealistic child.She read everything she could get hold of and we used to talk about books.”

“When?”asked Isabel, with a slight frown.

“Oh, when you were out being social with your mother. I used to go up to her grandfather's and we'd sit under a great elm they had there and read to one another.She loved poetry and wrote quite a lot herself.”

“Plenty of girls do that at that age. It's pretty poor stuff.”

“Of course it's a long time ago and I dare say I wasn't a very good judge.”

“You couldn't have been more than sixteen yourself.”

“Of course it was imitative. There was a lot of Robert Frost in it.But I have a notion it was rather remarkable for so young a girl.She had a delicate ear and a sense of rhythm.She had a feeling for the sounds and scents of the country, the first softness of spring in the air and the smell of the parched earth after rain.”

“I never knew she wrote poetry，”said Isabel.

“She kept it a secret, she was afraid you'd all laugh at her. She was very shy.”

“She's not that now.”

“When I came back from the war she was almost grown-up. She'd read a lot about the condition of the workingclasses and she'd seen something of it for herself in Chicago.She'd got on to Carl Sandburg and was writing savagely in free verse about the misery of the poor and the exploitation of the working classes.I dare say it was rather commonplace, but it was sincere and it had pity in it and aspiration.At that time she wanted to become a social worker.It was moving, her desire for sacrifice.I think she was capable of a great deal.She wasn't silly or mawkish, but she gave one the impression of a lovely purity and a strange loftiness of soul.We saw a lot of one another that year.”

I could see that Isabel listened to him with growing exasperation. Larry had no notion that he was driving a dagger in her heart and with his every detached word twisting it in the wound.But when she spoke it was with a smile on her lips.

“How did she come to choose you for her confidant?”

Larry looked at her with his trustful eyes.

“I don't know. She was a poor girl among all of you who had plenty of dough, and I didn't belong.I was there just because Uncle Bob practised at Marvin.I suppose she felt that gave us something in common.”

Larry had no relations. Most of us have at least cousins whom we may hardly know, but who at least give us a sense that we are part of the human family.Larry's father had been an only son, his mother an only daughter；his grandfather on one side, the Quaker, had been lost at sea when a young man and his grandfather on the other side had neither brother nor sister.No one could be more alone in the world than Larry.

“Did it ever occur to you that Sophie was in love with you?”asked Isabel.

“Never，”he smiled.

“Well, she was.”

“When he came back from the war as a wounded hero, half the girls in Chicago had a crush on Larry，”said Gray in his bluff way.

“This was more than a crush. She worshipped you, my poor Larry.D'you mean to say you didn't know it?”

“I certainly didn't and I don't believe it.”

“I suppose you thought she was too high-minded.”

“I can still see that skinny little girl with the bow in her hair and her serious face whose voice trembled with tears when she read that ode of Keats's because it was so beautiful. I wonder where she is now.”

Isabel gave a very slight start and threw him a suspicious inquiring glance.

“It's getting frightfully late and I'm so tired I don't know what to do. Let's go.”

On the following evening I took the Blue Train to the Riviera and two or three days later went over to Antibes to see Elliott and give him news of Paris. He looked far from well.The cure at Montecatini had not done him the good he expected, and his subsequent wanderings had exhausted him.He found a baptismal font in Venice and then went on to Florence to buy the triptych he had been negotiating for.Anxious to see these objects duly placed, he went down to the Pontine Marshes and put up at a miserable inn where the heat had been hard to bear.His precious purchases were a long time on the way, but determined not to leave till he had accomplished his purpose, he stayed on.He was delighted with the effect when at last everything was in order, and he showed me with pride the photographs he had taken.The church, though small, had dignity, and the restrained richness of the interior was proof of Elliott's good taste.

“I saw an early Christian sarcophagus in Rome that took my fancy and I deliberated a long time about buying it, but in the end I thought better of it.”

“What on earth did you want with an early Christian sarcophagus, Elliott?”

“To put myself in it, my dear fellow. It was of a very good design, and I thought it would balance the font on the other side of the entrance, but those early Christians were stumpy little fellows and I shouldn't have fitted in.I wasn't going to lie there till the Last Trump with my knees doubled up to my chin like a foetus.Most uncomfortable.”

I laughed, but Elliott was serious.

“I had a better idea. I've made all arrangements, with some difficulty, but that was to be expected, to be buried in front of the altar at the foot of the chancel steps, so that when the poor peasants of the Pontine Marshes come up to take the Sacrament they'll clump over my bones with their heavy shoes.Rather chic, don't you think?Just a plain stone slab with my name on it and a couple of dates.Si monumentum quaeris, circumspice.If you seek his monument, look around, you know.”

“I do know enough Latin to understand a hackneyed quotation, Elliott，”I said tartly.

“I beg your pardon, my dear fellow. I'm so accustomed to the crass ignorance of the upper classes, I forgot for the moment that I was talking to an author.”

He scored.

“But what I wanted to say to you was this，”he continued.“I've left proper instructions in my will, but I want you to see they're carried out. I will not be buried on the Riviera among a lot of retired colonels and middle-class French people.”

“Of course I'll do what you wish, Elliott, but I don't think we need plan for anything like that for many years to come.”

“I'm getting on, you know, and to tell you the truth I shan't be sorry to go. What are those lines of Landor's?‘I've warmed both hands……'”

Though I have a bad verbal memory, the poem is very short and I was able to repeat it.

“I strove with none, for none was worth my strife.

Nature I loved, and, next to Nature, Art；

I warmed both hands before the fire of Life；

It sinks and I am ready to depart.”

“That's it，”he said.

I could not but reflect that it was only by a violent stretch of the imagination that Elliott could fit the epigram to himself.

“It expresses my sentiments exactly，”he said, however.“The only thing I could add to it is that I've always moved in the best society in Europe.”

“It would be difficult to squeeze that into a quatrain.”

“Society is dead. At one time I had hopes that America would take the place of Europe and create an aristocracy that the hoi polloi would respect, but the depression has destroyed any chance of that.My poor country is becoming hopelessly middle-class.You wouldn't believe it, my dear fellow, but last time I was in America a taxi driver addressed me as brother.”

But though the Riviera, still shaken by the crash of'twenty-nine, was not what it had been, Elliott continued to give parties and go to parties. He had never frequented Jews, making an exception only for the family of Rothschild, but the grandest parties were being given now by members of the chosen race, and when there was a party Elliott could not bear not to go to it.He wandered through these gatherings, graciously shaking the hand of one or kissing that of another, but with a kind of forlorn detachment like an exiled royalty who felt a trifle embarrassed to find himself in such company.The exiled royalties, however, had the time of their lives, and to meet a film star seemed the height of their ambitions.Nor had Elliott ever looked with approval on the modern practice of treating members of the theatrical profession as persons whom you met socially；but a retired actress had built herself a sumptuous residence in his immediate neighbourhood and kept open house.Cabinet ministers, dukes, great ladies stayed with her for weeks on end.Elliott became a constant visitor.

“Of course it's a very mixed crowd，”he told me，“but one doesn't have to talk to people one doesn't want to. She'sa compatriot of mine and I feel I ought to help her out.It must be a relief to her house guests to find someone who can talk their own language.”

Sometimes he was obviously so far from well that I asked him why he didn't take things more easily.

“My dear fellow, at my age one can't afford to fall out. You don't think I've moved in the highest circles for nearly fifty years without realizing that if you're not seen everywhere you're forgotten.”

I wondered if he realized what a lamentable confession he was then making. I had not the heart to laugh at Elliott any more；he seemed to me a profoundly pathetic object.Society was what he lived for, a party was the breath of his nostrils, not to be asked to one was an affront, to be alone was a mortification；and, an old man now, he was desperately afraid.

So the summer passed. Elliott spent it scurrying from one end of the Riviera to the other, lunching in Cannes, dining in Monte Carlo, and exercising all his ingenuity to fit in a tea party here and a cocktail party there；and however tired he felt, taking pains to be affable, chatty, and amusing.He was full of gossip and you could trust him to know the details of the latest scandal before anyone but the parties immediately concerned.He would have stared at you with frank amazement had you suggested to him that his existence was futile.He would have thought you distressingly plebeian.

The autumn came and Elliott decided to go to Paris for a while, partly to see how Isabel, Gray, and the children were getting on, and partly to make what he called acte de présence in the capital.Then he meant to go to London to order some new clothes and incidentally to look up some old friends.My own plan was to go straight to London, but he asked me to drive up with him to Paris, and since that is an agreeable thing to do I consented and, having done so, saw no reason why I should not spend at least a few days in Paris myself.We made the journey by easy stages, stopping at places where the food was good；Elliott had something the matter with his kidneys and drank nothing but Vichy, but always insisted on choosing my half-bottle of wine for me and, too good-natured to grudge me a pleasure he could not share, got a genuine satisfaction out of my enjoyment of a fine vintage.He was so generous that I had difficulty in persuading him to let me pay my share of the expenses.Though I grew a little tired of his stories of the great whom he had known in the past I liked the trip.Much of the country we drove through, just touched with the beginning of its autumn beauty, was very lovely.Having lunched at Fontainebleau, we did not arrive in Paris till afternoon.Elliott dropped me at my modest, old-fashioned hotel and went round the corner to the Ritz.

We had warned Isabel of our arriving, so I was not surprised to find a note from her awaiting me, but I was surprised at its contents：

Come round the moment you get in. Something terrible has happened.Don't bring Uncle Elliott.For God's sake come as soon as you can.

I am not less curious than anyone else, but I had to have a wash and put on a clean shirt；then I took a taxi and went round to the apartment in the Rue St. Guillaume.I was shown into the drawing-room.Isabel sprang to her feet.

“Where have you been all this time?I've been waiting for hours.”

It was five o'clock and, before I could answer, the butler brought in the tea-things. Isabel, her hands clenched, watched him with impatience.I couldn't imagine what was the matter.

“I've only just arrived. We dawdled over lunch at Fontainebleau.”

“God, how slow he is. Maddening！”said Isabel.

The man placed the salver with the teapot and the sugar basin and the cups on the table and with what really was exasperating deliberation arranged around it plates of bread and butter, cakes, and cookies. He went out and closed thedoor behind him.

“Larry's going to marry Sophie Macdonald.”

“Who's she?”

“Don't be so stupid，”cried Isabel, her eyes flashing with anger.“That drunken slut we met at that filthy café you took us to.God knows why you took us to a place like that.Gray was disgusted.”

“Oh, you mean your Chicago friend?”I said, ignoring her unjust reproach.“How d'you know?”

“How should I know?He came and told me himself yesterday afternoon. I've been frantic ever since.”

“Supposing you sat down, gave me a cup of tea, and told me all about it.”

“Help yourself.”

She sat behind the tea-table and watched me irritably while I poured myself out a cup. I made myself comfortable on a small sofa by the fireplace.

“We haven't seen so much of him lately, since we came back from Dinard, I mean；he came up there for a few days, but wouldn't stay with us, he stayed at a hotel. He used to come down to the beach and play with the children.They're crazy about him.We played golf at St.Briac.Gray asked him one day if he'd seen Sophie again.

“‘Yes, I've seen her several times，'he said.

“‘Why?'I asked.

“‘She's an old friend，'he said.

“‘If I were you I wouldn't waste my time on her，'I said.

“Then he smiled. You know how he smiles, as though he thought what you'd said funny, though it isn't funny at all.

“‘But you're not me，'he said.

“I shrugged my shoulders and changed the conversation. I never gave the matter another thought.You can imagine my horror when he came here and told me they were going to be married.

“‘You can't, Larry，'I said.‘You can't.'

“‘I'm going to，'he said as calmly as if he was going to have a second helping of potatoes.‘And I want you to be very nice to her, Isabel.'

“‘That's asking too much，'I said.‘You're crazy. She's bad, bad, bad.'”

“What makes you think that?”I interrupted.

Isabel looked at me with flashing eyes.

“She's soused from morning till night. She goes to bed with every tough who asks her.”

“That doesn't mean she's bad. Quite a number of highly respected citizens get drunk and have a liking for rough trade.They're bad habits, like biting one's nails, but I don't know that they’re worse than that.I call a person bad who lies and cheats and is unkind.”

“If you're going to take her part I'll kill you.”

“How did Larry meet her again?”

“He found her address in the phone-book. He went to see her.She was sick, and no wonder, with the life she leads.He got a doctor and had someone in to look after her.That's how it started.He says she's given up drink；the damned fool thinks she's cured.”

“Have you forgotten what Larry did for Gray?He's cured him, hasn't he?”

“That's different. Gray wanted to be cured.She doesn't.”

“How d'you know?”

“Because I know women. When a woman goes to pieces like that she's done for；she can never get back.If Sophie's what she is, it's because she was like that always.D'you think she'll stick to Larry?Of course not.Sooner or later she’ll break out.It’s in her blood.It’s a brute she wants, that’s what excites her, and it’s a brute she’ll go after.She’ll lead Larry a hell of a life.”

“I think it's very probable, but I don't know what you can do about it. He's going into this with his eyes open.”

“I can do nothing about it, but you can.”

“I?”

“Larry likes you and he listens to what you say. You're the only person who has any influence over him.You know the world.Go to him and tell him that he can't make such a fool of himself.Tell him that it'll ruin him.”

“He'll only tell me that it's no business of mine and he'll be quite right.”

“But you like him, at least you're interested in him, you can't sit by and let him make a hopeless mess of his life.”

“Gray's his oldest and most intimate friend. I don't think it'll do any good, but I should have thought Gray was the best person to speak to him.”

“Oh, Gray，”she said impatiently.

“You know it may not turn out so badly as you think. I've known two or three fellows, one in Spain and two in the East, who married whores, and they made them very good wives.They were grateful to their husbands, for the security they gave them, I mean, and they of course knew what pleases a man.”

“You make me tired. D'you think I sacrificed myself to let Larry fall into the hands of a raging nymphomaniac?”

“How did you sacrifice yourself?”

“I gave Larry up for the one and only reason that I didn't want to stand in his way.”

“Come off it, Isabel. You gave him up for a square-cut diamond and a sable coat.”

The words were hardly out of my mouth when a plate of bread and butter came flying at my head. By sheer luck I caught the plate, but the bread and butter was scattered on the floor.I got up and put the plate back on the table.

“Your uncle Elliott wouldn't have thanked you if you'd broken one of his Crown Derby plates. They were made for the third Duke of Dorset and they're almost priceless.”

“Pick up the bread and butter，”she snapped.

“Pick it up yourself，”I said, seating myself again on the sofa.

She got up and, fuming, picked up the scattered pieces.

“And you call yourself an English gentleman，”she exclaimed, savagely.

“No, that's a thing I've never done in all my life.”

“Get the hell out of here. I never want to see you again.I hate the sight of you.”

“I'm sorry for that, because the sight of you always gives me pleasure. Have you ever been told that your nose is exactly like that of the Psyche in the museum of Naples, and that's the loveliest representation of virginal beauty that ever existed.You've got exquisite legs, so long and shapely, and I never cease to be surprised at them, because they were thick and lumpy when you were a girl, I can't imagine how you've managed it.”

“An iron will and the grace of God，”she said angrily.

“But of course your hands are your most fascinating feature. They're so slim and so elegant.”

“I was under the impression you thought them too big.”

“Not for your height and build. I'm always amazed at the infinite grace with which you use them.Whether by nature or by art you never make a gesture without imparting beauty to it.They're like flowers sometimes and sometimes like birds on the wing.They're more expressive than any words you can say.They're like the hands of El Greco's portraits；in fact, when I look at them I’m inclined to believe Elliott’s highly improbable story of your having an ancestor who was a Spanish grandee.”

She looked up crossly.

“What are you talking about?That's the first I've heard of it.”

I told her about the Count de Lauria and Queen Mary's maid of honour from whose issue in the female line Elliott traced his descent. Meanwhile Isabel contemplated her long fingers and her manicured painted nails with complacency.

“One must be descended from someone，”she said. Then with a tiny chuckle, giving me a mischievous look in which no trace of rancour remained, she added：“You lousy bastard.”

So easy is it to make a woman see reason if you only tell her the truth.

“There are moments when I don't positively dislike you，”said Isabel.

She came and sat on the sofa beside me and, slipping her arm through mine, leant over to kiss me. I withdrew my cheek.

“I will not have my face smeared with lipstick，”I said.“If you want to kiss me, kiss me on the lips, which is what merciful Providence intended them for.”

She giggled and, her hand turning my head towards her, with her lips pressed a thin layer of paint on mine. The sensation was far from unpleasant.

“Now you've done that, perhaps you'll tell me what it is you want.”

“Advice.”

“I'm quite willing to give you that, but I don't think for a moment you'll take it. There's only one thing you can do and that is to make the best of a bad job.”

Flaring up again, she snatched her arm away and, getting up, flung herself into a chair on the other side of the fireplace.

“I'm not going to sit by and let Larry ruin himself. I'll stick at nothing to prevent him from marrying that slut.”

“You won't succeed. You see, he's enthralled by one of the most powerful emotions that can beset the human breast.”

“You don't mean to say you think he's in love with her?”

“No. That would be trifling in comparison.”

“Well?”

“Have you ever read the New Testament?”

“I suppose so.”

“D'you remember how Jesus was led into the wilderness and fasted forty days?Then, when he was a-hungered, the devil came to him and said：If thou be the son of God, command that these stones be made bread. But Jesus resisted the temptation.Then the devil set him on a pinnacle of the temple and said to him：If thou be the son of God, cast thyself down.For angels had charge of him and would bear him up.But again Jesus resisted.Then the devil took him into a high mountain and showed him the kingdoms of the world and said that he would give them to him if he would fall down and worship him.But Jesus said：Get thee hence, Satan.That's the end of the story according to the good simple Matthew.But it wasn't.The devil was sly and he came to Jesus once more and said：If thou wilt accept shame and disgrace, scourging, a crown of thorns and death on the cross, thou shalt save the human race, for greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.Jesus fell.The devil laughed till his sides ached, for he knew the evil men would commit in the name of their redeemer.”

Isabel looked at me indignantly.

“Where on earth did you get that?”

“Nowhere. I've invented it on the spur of the moment.”

“I think it's idiotic and blasphemous.”

“I only wanted to suggest to you that self-confidence is a passion so overwhelming that beside it even lust and hunger are trifling. It whirls its victim to destruction in the highest affirmation of his personality.The object doesn't matter；it may be worth while or it may be worthless.No wine is so intoxicating, no love so shattering, no vice so compelling.When he sacrifices himself man for a moment is greater than God, for how can God, infinite and omnipotent, sacrifice himself?At best he can only sacrifice his only begotten son.”

“Oh, Christ, how you bore me，”said Isabel.

I paid no attention.

“How can you suppose that common sense or prudence will have any effect on Larry when he's in the grip of a passion like that?You don't know what he's been seeking all these years. I don't know either, I only suspect.All theseyears of labour, all these experiences he garnered weigh nothing in the balance now they're set against his desire-oh, it’s more than a desire, his urgent, clamorous need to save the soul of a wanton woman whom he’d known as an innocent child.I think you’re right, I think he’s undertaking a hopeless job；with his acute sensibility he’ll suffer the tortures of the damned；his life’s work, whatever it may be, will remain undone.The ignoble Paris killed Achilles by shooting an arrow in his heel.Larry lacks just that touch of ruthlessness that even the saint must have to win his halo.”

“I love him，”said Isabel.“God knows, I ask nothing of him. I expect nothing.No one could love anyone more unselfishly than I love him.He's going to be so unhappy.”

She began to cry and, thinking it would do her good, I let her be. I diverted myself idly with the idea that had sprung so unexpectedly into my mind.I played with it.I couldn't but surmise that the devil, looking at the cruel wars that Christianity has occasioned, the persecutions, the tortures Christian has inflicted on Christian, the unkindness, the hypocrisy, the intolerance, must consider the balance sheet with complacency.And when he remembers that it has laid upon mankind the bitter burden of the sense of sin that has darkened the beauty of the starry night and cast a baleful shadow on the passing pleasures of a world to be enjoyed, he must chuckle as he murmurs：give the devil his due.

Presently Isabel took a handkerchief from her bag and a mirror and, looking at herself, carefully wiped the corner of her eyes.

“Damned sympathetic, aren't you?”she snapped.

I looked at her pensively, but did not answer. She powdered her face and painted her lips.

“You said just now you suspected what he's been after all these years. What did you mean?”

“I can only guess, you know, and I may be quite wrong. I think he's been seeking for a philosophy, or maybe a religion, and a rule of life that'll satisfy both his head and his heart.”

Isabel considered this for a moment. She sighed.

“Don't you think it's very strange that a country boy from Marvin, Illinois, should have a notion like that?”

“No stranger than that Luther Burbank who was born on a farm in Massachusetts should have produced a seedless orange or that Henry Ford who was born on a farm in Michigan should have invented a Tin Lizzie.”

“But those are practical things. That's in the American tradition.”

I laughed.

“Can anything in the world be more practical than to learn how to live to best advantage?”

Isabel gave a gesture of lassitude.

“You don't want to lose Larry altogether, do you?”

She shook her head.

“You know how loyal he is：if you won't have anything to do with his wife he won't have anything to do with you. If you've got any sense you'll make friends with Sophie.You'll forget the past and be as nice to her as you can be when you like.She’s going to be married and I suppose she’s buying some clothes.Why don’t you offer to go shopping with her?I think she’d jump at it.”

Isabel listened to me with narrowed eyes. She seemed intent upon what I was saying.For a moment she pondered, but I could not guess what was passing through her mind.Then she surprised me.

“Will you ask her to lunch?It would be rather awkward for me after what I said to Larry yesterday.”

“Will you behave if I do?”

“Like an angel of light，”she answered with her most engaging smile.

“I'll fix it up right away.”

There was a phone in the room. I soon found Sophie's number, and after the usual delay which those who use the French telephone learn to put up with patiently, I got her.I mentioned my name.

“I've just arrived in Paris，”I said，“and heard that you and Larry are going to be married. I want to congratulate you.I hope you'll be very happy.”I smothered a cry as Isabel, who was standing by me, gave the soft of my arm a vicious pinch.“I'm only here for a verv short time and I wonder if you and Larry will come and lunch with me the dayafter tomorrow at the Ritz.I'm asking Gray and Isabel and Elliott Templeton.”

“I'll ask Larry. He's here now.”There was a pause.“Yes, we shall be glad to.”

I fixed an hour, made a civil remark, and replaced the receiver on its stand. I caught an expression in Isabel's eyes that caused me some misgiving.

“What are you thinking?”I asked her.“I don't quite like the look of you.”

“I'm sorry；I thought that was the one thing about me you did like.”

“You haven't got some nefarious scheme that you're hatching, Isabel?”

She opened her eyes very wide.

“I promise you I haven't. As a matter of fact I'm terribly curious to see what Sophie looks like now Larry has reformed her.All I hope is that she won't come to the Ritz with a mask of paint on her face.”

My little party did not go too badly. Gray and Isabel arrived first；Larry and Sophie Macdonald five minutes later.Isabel and Sophie kissed each other warmly and Isabel and Gray congratulated her on her engagement.I caught the appraising sweep of the eyes with which Isabel took in Sophie's appearance.I was shocked at it.When I saw her in that dive in the Rue de Lappe, outrageously painted, with hennaed hair, in the bright green coat, though she looked outrageous and was very drunk, there was something provocative and even basely alluring in her；but now she looked drab and, though certainly a year or two younger than Isabel, much older.She still had that gallant tilt of her head, but now, I don't know why, it was pathetic.She was letting her hair go back to its natural colour and it had the slatternly look that hair has when it has been dyed and left to grow.Except for a streak of red on her lips she had no make-up on.Her skin was rough and it had an unhealthy pallor.I remembered how vividly green her eyes had looked, but now they were pale and grey.She wore a red dress, obviously brand-new, with hat, shoes, and bag to match；I don't pretend to know anything about women's clothes, but I had a feeling that it was fussy and too elaborate for the occasion.On her breast was a piece of showy artificial jewellery such as you buy in the Rue de Rivoli.Beside Isabel, in black silk, with a string of cultured pearls round her neck and in a very smart hat, she looked cheap and dowdy.

I ordered cocktails, but Larry and Sophie refused them. Then Elliott arrived.His progress through the vast foyer was, however, impeded by the hands he had to shake and the hands he had to kiss as he saw one person after the other whom he knew.He behaved as though the Ritz were his private house and he were assuring his guests of his pleasure that they had been able to accept his invitation.He had been told nothing about Sophie except she had lost her husband and child in a motor accident and was now going to marry Larry.When at last he reached us he congratulated them both with the elaborate graciousness of which he was a master.We went in to the dining-room and since we were four men and two women I placed Isabel and Sophie opposite one another at the round table, with Sophie between Gray and myself；but the table was small enough for the conversation to be general.I had already ordered the luncheon and the wine waiter came along with the wine card.

“You don't know anything about wine, my dear fellow，”said Elliott.“Give me the wine card, Albert.”He turned over the pages.“I drink nothing but Vichy myself, but I can't bear to see people drink wine that isn't perfect.”

He and Albert, the wine waiter, were old friends and after an animated discussion they decided on the wine I should give my guests. Then he turned to Sophie.

“And where are you going for your honeymoon, my dear?”

He glanced at her dress and an almost imperceptible raising of his eyebrows showed me that he had formed an unfavourable opinion of it.

“We're going to Greece.”

“I've been trying to get there for ten years，”said Larry，“but somehow I've never been able to manage it.”

“It ought to be lovely at this time of the year，”said Isabel, with a show of enthusiasm.

She remembered, as I remembered, that that was where Larry proposed to take her when he wanted her to marry him. It seemed to be an idée fixe with Larry to go to Greece on a honeymoon.

The conversation flowed none too easily and I should have found it a difficult row to hoe if it hadn't been for Isabel. She was on her best behaviour.Whenever silence seemed to threaten us and I racked my brain for some-thing fresh to talk about, she broke in with facile chatter.I was grateful to her.Sophie hardly spoke except when she was spoken to and then it seemed an effort to her.The spirit had gone out of her.You would have said that something had died in her and I asked myself if Larry wasn't putting her to a strain greater than she could support.If as I suspected she had doped as well as drunk, the sudden deprivation must have worn her nerves to a frazzle.Sometimes I intercepted a look between them.In his I saw tenderness and encouragement, but in hers an appeal that was pathetic.It may be that Gray with his sweetness of disposition instinctively felt what I thought I saw, for he began to tell her how Larry had cured him of the headaches that had incapacitated him and went on to say how much he had depended on him and how much he owed him.

“Now I'm fit as a flea，”he continued.“As soon as ever I can get a job I'm going back to work. I've got several irons in the fire and I'm hoping to land something before long.Gosh, it'll be good to be back home again.”

Gray meant well, but what he had said was perhaps not very tactful if, as I supposed, Larry to cure Sophie of her aggravated alcoholism had used with her the same method of suggestion-for that to my mind was what it was-that had been successful with Gray.

“You never have headaches now, Gray?”asked Elliott.

“I haven't had one for three months and if I think one's coming on I take hold of my charm and I'm all right.”He fished out of his pocket the ancient coin Larry had given him.“I wouldn't sell it for a million dollars.”

We finished luncheon and coffee was served. The wine waiter came up and asked whether we wanted liqueurs.We all refused except Gray, who said he would have a brandy.When the bottle was brought Elliott insisted on looking at it.

“Yes, I can recommend it. That'll do you no harm.”

“A little glass for Monsieur?”asked the waiter.

“Alas, it's forbidden me.”

Elliott told him at some length that he was having trouble with his kidneys and that his doctor would not allow him to drink alcohol.

“A tear of zubrovka could do Monsieur no harm. It's well known to be very good for the kidneys.We have just received a consignment from Poland.”

“Is that true?It's hard to get nowadays. Let me have a look at a bottle.”

The wine waiter, a portly, dignified creature with a long silver chain round his neck, went away to fetch it, and Elliott explained that it was the Polish form of vodka but in every way superior.

“We used to drink it at the Radziwills when I stayed with them for the shooting. You should have seen those Polish princes putting it away；I'm not exaggerating when I tell you that they'd drink it by the tumbler without turning a hair.Good blood, of course；aristocrats to the tips of their fingers.Sophie, you must try it, and you too, Isabel.It's an experience no one can afford to miss.”

The wine waiter brought the bottle. Larry, Sophie, and I refused to be tempted, but Isabel said she would like to try it.I was surprised, for habitually she drank very little and she had had two cocktails and two or three glasses of wine.The waiter poured out a glass of pale green liquid and Isabel sniffed it.

“Oh, what a lovely smell.”

“Hasn't it?”cried Elliott.“That's the herbs they put in it；it's they that give it its delicate taste. Just to keep you company I'll have a drop.It can't hurt me for once.”

“It tastes divine，”said Isabel.“It's like mother's milk. I've never tasted anything so good.”

Elliott raised his glass to his lips.

“Oh, how it brings back the old days！You people who never stayed with the Radziwills don't know what living is. That was the grand style.Feudal, you know.You might have thought yourself back in the Middle Ages.You were met at the station by a carriage with six horses and postilions.And at dinner a footman in livery behind every person.”

He went on to describe the magnificence and luxury of the establishment and the brilliance of the parties；and the suspicion, doubtless unworthy, occurred to me that the whole thing was a put-up job between Elliott and the wine waiter to give Elliott an opportunity to discourse upon the grandeur of this princely family and the host of Polish aristocrats he hobnobbed with in their castle. There was no stopping him.

“Another glass, Isabel?”

“Oh, I daren't. But it is heavenly.I'm so glad to know about it；Gray, we must get some.”

“I'll have some sent round to the apartment.”

“Oh, Uncle Elliott, would you?”cried Isabel enthusiastically.“You are so kind to us. You must try it, Gray；it smells of freshly mown hay and spring flowers, of thyme and lavender, and it's soft on the palate and so comfort-able, it's like listening to music by moonlight.”

It was unlike Isabel to gush inordinately and I wondered if she was a trifle tight. The party broke up.I shook hands with Sophie.

“When are you going to be married?”I asked her.

“The week after next. I hope you'll come to the wedding.”

“I'm afraid I shan't be in Paris. I'm leaving for London tomorrow.”

While I was saying good-bye to the rest of my guests Isabel took Sophie aside and talked to her for a minute, then turned to Gray.

“Oh, Gray, I'm not coming home just yet. There's a dress show at Molyneux's and I'm taking Sophie to it.She ought to see the new models.”

“I'd love to，”said Sophie.

We parted. I took Suzanne Rouvier out to dinner that night and next morning started for England.

Elliott arrived at Claridge's a fortnight later and shortly afterwards I dropped in to see him. He had ordered himself several suits of clothes and at what I thought excessive length told me in detail what he had chosen and why.When at last I could get a word in I asked him how the wedding had gone off.

“It didn't go off，”he answered grimly.

“What do you mean?”

“Three days before it was to take place Sophie disappeared. Larry hunted everywhere for her.”

“What an extraordinary thing！Did they have a row?”

“No. Far from it.Everything had been arranged.I was going to give her away.They were taking the Orient Express immediately after the wedding.If you ask me, I think Larry's well out of it.”

I guessed that Isabel had told Elliott everything.

“What exactly happened?”I asked.

“Well, you remember that day we lunched at the Ritz with you. Isabel took her to Molyneux's.D'you remember the dress Sophie wore?Deplorable.Did you notice the shoulders?That's how you tell if a dress is well made, by the way it fits over the shoulders.Of course, poor girl, she couldn't afford Molyneux's prices, and Isabel, you know how generous she is, and after all they’ve known one another since they were children, Isabel offered to give her a dress so that at least she’d have something decent to be married in.Naturally she jumped at it.Well, to cut a long story short, Isabel asked her to come to the apartment one day at three so that they could go together for the final fitting.Sophie came all right, but unfortunately Isabel had to take one of the children to the dentist’s and didn’t get in till after four and by that time Sophie had gone.Isabel thought she’d got tired of waiting and had gone on to Molyneux’s, so she wentthere at once, but she hadn’t come.At last she gave her up and went home again.They were all going to dine together and Larry came along at dinner-time and the first thing she asked him was where Sophie was.

“He couldn't understand it and he rang up her apartment, but there was no reply, so he said he'd go down there. They held dinner up as long as they could, but neither of them turned up and so they had dinner by themselves.Of course you know what Sophie's life was before you ran into her in the Rue de Lappe；that was a most unfortunate idea of yours to take them down there.Well, Larry spent all night going around her old haunts, but couldn't find her anywhere.He went to the apartment after time, but the concierge said she hadn't been in.He spent three days hunting for her.She’d just vanished.Then on the fourth day he went to the apartment again and the concierge told him she’d been in and packed a bag and gone away in a taxi.”

“Was Larry awfully upset?”

“I didn't see him. Isabel tells me he was rather.”

“She didn't write or anything?”

“Nothing.”

I thought it over.

“What do you make of it?”I said.

“My dear fellow, exactly what you make of it. She couldn't stick it out.She went on the booze again.”

That was obvious, but for all that it was strange. I couldn't see why she had chosen just that moment to skip.

“How is Isabel taking it?”

“Of course she's sorry, but she's a sensible girl and she told me she always thought it would be a disaster if Larry married a woman like that.”

“And Larry?”

“Isabel's been very kind to him. She says that what makes it difficult is that he won't discuss it.He'll be all right, you know；Isabel says he was never in love with Sophie.He was only marrying her out of a sort of misguided chivalry.”

I could see Isabel putting a brave face on a turn of events that was certainly causing her a great deal of satisfaction. I well knew that next time I saw her she would not fail to point out to me that she had known all along what would happen.

But it was nearly a year before I saw her again and though by that time I could have told her something about Sophie that would have set her thinking, the circumstances were such that I had no inclination to. I stayed in London till nearly Christmas and then, wanting to get home, went straight down to the Riviera without stopping in Paris.I set to work on a novel and for the next few months lived in retirement.I saw Elliott now and then.It was obvious that his health was failing, and it pained me that he persisted notwithstanding in leading a social life.He was vexed with me because I would not drive thirty miles to go to the constant parties he continued to give.He thought it very conceited of me to prefer to sit at home and work.

“It's an unusually brilliant season, my dear fellow，”he told me.“It's a crime to shut yourself up in your house and miss everything that's going on. And why you had to choose a part of the Riviera to live in that's completely out of fashion I shan't be able to understand if I live to be a hundred.”

Poor nice silly Elliott；it was very clear that he would live to no such age.

By June I had finished the rough draft of my novel and thought I deserved a holiday, so, packing a bag, I got on the cutter from which in summer we used to bathe in the Baie des Fosses and set sail along the coast towards Marseilles. There was only a fitful breeze and for the most part we chugged along with the motor auxiliary.We spent a night in the harbour at Cannes, another at Sainte Maxime, and a third at Sanary.Then we got to Toulon.That is a port I have always had an affection for.The ships of the French fleet give it an air at once romantic and companionable, and I am never tired of wandering about its old streets.I can linger for hours on the quay, watching the sailors on shore leave strolling about in pairs or with their girls, and the civilians who saunter back and forth as though they had nothing in the world to do but enjoy the pleasant sunshine.Because of all these ships and the ferryboats that take the bustling crowd to variouspoints of the vast harbour, Toulon gives you the effect of a terminal on which all the ways of the wide world converge；and as you sit in a café，your eyes a little dazzled by the brightness of sea and sky, your fancy takes golden journeys to the uttermost parts of the earth.You land in a longboat on a coral beach, fringed with coconut palms, in the Pacific；you step off the gangway on to the dock at Rangoon and get into a rickshaw；you watch from the upper deck the noisy, gesticulating crowd of Negroes as your ship is made fast to the pier at Port au Prince.

We got in lateish in the morning and towards the middle of the afternoon I landed and walked along the quay, looking at the shops, at the people who passed me, and at the people sitting under the awning in the cafés.Suddenly I saw Sophie and at the same moment she saw me.She smiled and said hello.I stopped and shook hands with her.She was by herself at a small table with an empty glass before her.

“Sit down and have a drink，”she said.

“You have one with me，”I replied, taking a chair.

She wore the striped blue-and-white jersey of the French sailor, a pair of bright red slacks, and sandals through which protruded the painted nails of her big toes. She wore no hat, and her hair, cut very short and curled, was of so pale a gold that it was almost silver.She was as heavily made up as when we had run across her at the Rue de Lappe.She had had a drink or two as I judged from the saucers on the table, but she was sober.She did not seem dis-pleased to see me.

“How are all the folks in Paris?”she asked.

“I think they're all right. I haven't seen any of them since that day we all lunched together at the Ritz.”

She blew a great cloud of smoke from her nostrils and began to laugh.

“I didn't marry Larry after all.”

“I know. Why not?”

“Darling, when it came to the point I couldn't see myself being Mary Magdalen to his Jesus Christ. No, sir.”

“What made you change your mind at the last moment?”

She looked at me mockingly. With that audacious tilt of the head, with her small breasts and narrow flanks, in that get-up, she looked like a vicious boy；but I must admit that she was much more attractive than in the red dress, with its dismal air of provincial smartness, in which I had last seen her.Face and neck were deeply burnt by the sun, and though the brownness of her skin made the rouge on her cheeks and the black of her eyebrows more aggres-sive, the effect in its vulgar way was not without lure.

“Would you like me to tell you?”

I nodded. The waiter brought the beer I had ordered for myself and the brandy and seltzer for her.She lit a caporal from one she had just finished.

“I hadn't had a drink for three months. I hadn't had a smoke.”She saw my faint look of surprise and laughed.“I don't mean cigarettes.Opium.I felt awful.You know, sometimes when I was alone I'd shriek the place down；I'd say，‘I can’t go through with it, I can’t go through with it.’It wasn’t so bad when I was with Larry, but when he wasn’t there it was hell.”

I was looking at her and when she mentioned opium I scanned her more sharply；I noticed the pin-point pupils that showed she was smoking it now. Her eyes were startlingly green.

“Isabel was giving me my wedding dress. I wonder what's happened to it now.It was a peach.We'd arranged that I should pick her up and we'd go to Molyneux's together.I will say this for Isabel, what she doesn't know about clothes isn’t worth knowing.When I got to the apartment their man said she’d had to take Joan to the dentist’s and had left a message that she’d be in directly.I went into the living-room.The coffee things were still on the table and I asked the man if I could have a cup.Coffee was the only thing that kept me going.He said he’d bring me some and took the empty cups and the coffee-pot away.He left a bottle on the tray.I looked at it, and it was that Polish stuff you’d all talked about at the Ritz.”

“Zubrovka. I remember Elliott saying he'd send Isabel some.”

“You'd all raved how good it smelt and I was curious. I took out the cork and had a sniff.You were quite right；it smelt damned good.I lit a cigarette and in a few minutes the man came in with the coffee.That was good too.They talk a lot about French coffee, they can have it；give me American coffee.That's the only thing I miss here.But Isabel's coffee wasn't bad, I was feeling lousy, and after I'd had a cup I felt better.I looked at that bottle standing there.It was a terrible temptation, but I said，‘To hell with it, I won’t think of it，’and I lit another cigarette.I thought Isabel would be in any minute, but she didn’t come.I got frightfully nervous；I hate being kept waiting and there was nothing to read in the room.I started walking about and looking at the pictures, but I kept on seeing that damned bottle.Then I thought I’d just pour out a glass and look at it.It had such a pretty colour.”

“Pale green.”

“That's right. It's funny, its colour is just like its smell.It's like that green you sometimes see in the heart of a white rose.I had to see if it tasted like that, I thought just a taste couldn't hurt me；I only meant to take a sip and then I heard a sound, I thought it was Isabel coming in and I swallowed the glassful because I didn't want her to catch me.But it wasn’t Isabel after all.Gosh, it made me feel good, I hadn’t felt like that since I’d gone on the wagon.I really began to feel alive again.If Isabel had come in then I suppose I’d be married to Larry now.I wonder how it would have turned out.”

“And she didn't come in?”

“No, she didn't. I was furious with her.Who did she think she was, keeping me waiting like that?And then I saw that the liqueur glass was full again；I suppose I must have poured it out without thinking, but, believe it or not, I didn't know I had.It seemed silly to pour it back again, so I drank it.There's no denying it, it was delicious.I felt a different woman；I felt like laughing and I hadn't felt like that for three months.D'you remember that old cissie saying he’d seen fellas in Poland drink it by the tumbler without turning a hair?Well, I thought I could take what any Polish son of a bitch could take and you may as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb, so I emptied the dregs of my coffee in the fireplace and filled the cup to the brim.Talk of mother’s milk-my arse.Then I don’t quite know what happened, but I don’t believe there was much left in the bottle by the time I was through.Then I thought I’d get out before Isabel came in.She nearly caught me.Just as I got out of the front door I heard Joanie’s voice.I ran up the stairs and waited till they were safely in the apartment and then I dashed down and got into a taxi.I told the driver to drive like hell and when he asked where to I burst out laughing in his face.I felt like a million dollars.”

“Did you go back to your apartment?”I asked, though I knew she hadn't.

“What sort of a damn fool d'you take me for?I knew Larry would come and look for me. I didn't dare go to any of the places I used to go to, so I went to Hakim's.I knew Larry'd never find me there.Besides, I wanted a smoke.”

“What's Hakim's?”

“Hakim's?Hakim's an Algerian and he can always get you opium if you've got the dough to pay for it. He was quite a friend of mine.He'll get you anything you want, a boy, a man, a woman, or a nigger.He always has half a dozen Algerians on tap.I spent three days there.I don't know how many men I didn’t have.”She began to giggle.“All shapes, sizes, and colours.I made up for lost time all right.But you know, I was scared.I didn’t feel safe in Paris, I was afraid Larry’d find me, besides I hadn’t got any money left, those bastards you have to pay them to go to bed with you, so I got out, I went back to the apartment and gave the concierge a hundred francs and told her if anyone came and asked for me to say I’d gone away.I packed my things and that night I took the train to Toulon.I didn’t feel really safe till I got here.”

“And have you been here ever since?”

“You betcha, and I'm going to stay here. You can get all the opium you want, the sailors bring it back from the East, and it's good stuff, not that muck they sell you in Paris.I've got a room at the hotel.You know, the Commerce et la Marine.When you go in there at night the corridors just reek of it.”She sniffed voluptuously.“Sweet and acrid, and you know they're smoking in their rooms, and it gives you a nice homey feeling.And they don't mind who you take in with you.They come and thump at your door at five in the morning to get the sailors up to go back to their ships, so youdon’t have to worry about that.”And then, without transition：“I saw a book of yours in the store just along the quay；if I’d known I was going to see you I’d have bought it and got you to sign it.”

When passing the bookshop I had stopped to look in the window and had noticed among other new books the translation of a novel of mine that had recently appeared.

“I don't suppose it would have amused you much，”I said.

“I don't know why it shouldn't. I can read, you know.”

“And you can write too, I believe.”

She gave me a rapid glance and began to laugh.

“Yeah, I used to write poetry when I was a kid. I guess it was pretty terrible, but I thought it fine.I suppose Larry told you.”She hesitated for a moment.“Life's hell anyway, but if there is any fun to be got out of it, you're only a god-damn fool if you don't get it.”She threw back her head defiantly.“If I buy that book will you write in it?”

“I'm leaving tomorrow. If you really want it, I'll get you a copy and leave it at your hotel.”

“That'd be swell.”

Just then a naval launch came up to the quay and a crowd of sailors tumbled out of it. Sophie embraced them with a glance.

“That'll be my boy friend.”She waved her arm at someone.“You can stand him a drink and then you better scram. He's a Corsican and as jealous as our old friend Jehovah.”

A young man came up to us, hesitated when he saw me, but on a beckoning gesture came up to the table. He was tall, swarthy, clean-shaven, with splendid dark eyes, an aquiline nose, and raven black, wavy hair.He did not look more than twenty.Sophie introduced me as an American friend of her childhood.

“Dumb but beautiful，”she said to me.

“You like'em tough, don't you?”

“The tougher the better.”

“One of these days you'll get your throat cut.”

“I wouldn't be surprised，”she grinned.“Good riddance to bad rubbish.”

“One's going to speak French, isn't one?”the sailor said sharply.

Sophie turned upon him a smile in which there was a trace of mockery. She spoke a fluent and slangy French, with a strong American accent, but this gave the vulgar and obscene colloquialisms that she commonly used a comic tang, so that you could not help but laugh.

“I was telling him that you were beautiful, but to spare your modesty I was saying it in English.”She addressed me.“And he's strong. He has the muscles of a boxer.Feel them.”

The sailor's sullenness was dispelled by the flattery and with a complacent smile he flexed his arm so that the biceps stood out.

“Feel it，”he said.“Go on, feel it.”

I did so and expressed a proper admiration. We chatted for a few minutes.I paid for the drinks and got up.

“I must be going.”

“It's nice to have seen you. Don't forget the book.”

“I won't.”

I shook hands with them both and strolled off. On my way I stopped at the bookshop, bought the novel, and wrote Sophie's name and my own.Then, because it suddenly occurred to me I could think of nothing else, I wrote the first line of Ronsard's lovely little poem which is in all the anthologies：

Mignonne, allons voir si la rose……

I left it at the hotel. It is on the quay and I have often stayed there because when you are awakened at dawn by theclarion that calls the men on night leave back to duty the sun rising mistily over the smooth water of the harbour invests the wraithlike ships with a shrouded loveliness.Next day we sailed for Cassis, where I wanted to buy some wine, and then to Marseilles to take up a new sail that we had ordered.A week later I got home.





7


I found a message from Joseph, Elliott's manservant, to tell me that Elliott was ill in bed and would be glad to see me, so next day I drove over to Antibes. Joseph, before taking me up to see his master, told me that Elliott had had an attack of uraemia and that his doctor took a grave view of his condition.He had come through it and was getting better, but his kidneys were diseased and it was impossible that he should ever completely recover.Joseph had been with Elliott for forty years and was devoted to him, but though his manner was regretful it was impossible not to notice the inner satisfaction with which, like so many members of his class, catastrophe in the house filled him.

“Ce pauvre monsieur，”he sighed.“Evidently he had his manias but at bottom he was good. Sooner or later he must die.”

He spoke already as though Elliott were at his last gasp.

“I'm sure he's provided for you, Joseph，”I said grimly.

“One must hope it，”he said mournfully.

I was surprised when he ushered me into the bedroom to find Elliott very spry. He was pale and looked old, but was in good spirits.He was shaved and his hair was neatly brushed.He wore pale blue silk pyjamas, on the pocket of which were embroidered his initials surmounted by his count's crown.These, much larger and again with the crown, were heavily embroidered on the turned-down sheet.

I asked him how he felt.

“Perfectly well，”he said cheerfully.“It's only a temporary indisposition. I shall be up and about again in a few days.I've got the Grand Duke Dimitri lunching with me on Saturday, and I've told my doctor he must put me to rights by then at all costs.”

I spent half an hour with him, and on my way out asked Joseph to let me know if Elliott had a relapse. I was astonished a week later when I went to lunch with one of my neighbours to find him there.Dressed for a party, he looked like death.

“You oughtn't to be out, Elliott，”I told him.

“Oh, what nonsense, my dear fellow. Frieda is expecting the Princess Mafalda.I've known the Italian royal family for years, ever since poor Louisa was en poste at Rome, and I couldn't let poor Frieda down.”

I did not know whether to admire his indomitable spirit or to lament that at his age, stricken with mortal illness, he should still retain his passion for society. You would never have thought he was a sick man.Like a dying actor when he has the grease paint on his face and steps on the stage, who forgets for the time being his aches and pains, Elliott played his part of the polished courtier with his accustomed assurance.He was infinitely amiable, flatter-ingly attentive to the proper people, and amusing with that malicious irony at which he was an adept.I think I had never seen him display his social gift to greater advantage.When the Royal Highness had departed（and the grace with which Elliott bowed, managing to combine respect for her exalted rank with an old man's admiration for a comely woman, was a sight to see）I was not surprised to hear our hostess tell him that he had been the life and soul of the party.

A few days later he was in bed again and his doctor forbade him to leave his room. Elliott was exasperated.

“It's too bad this should happen just now. It's a particularly brilliant season.”

He reeled off a long list of persons of importance who were spending the summer on the Riviera.

I went to see him every three or four days. Sometimes he was in bed, but sometimes he lay on a chaise longue in a gorgeous dressing-gown.He seemed to have an inexhaustible supply of them, for I do not remember that I ever saw him in the same one twice.On one of these occasions, it was the beginning of August by now, I found Elliott unusually quiet.Joseph had told me when he let me into the house that he seemed a little better so I was surprised that he was so listless.I tried to amuse him with such gossip of the coast as I had picked up, but he was plainly uninterested.There was a slight frown between his eyes, and a sullenness in his expression that was unusual with him.

“Are you going to Edna Novemali's party?”he asked me suddenly.

“No, of course not.”

“Has she asked you?”

“She's asked everybody on the Riviera.”

The Princess Novemali was an American of immense wealth who had married a Roman prince, but not an ordinary prince such as go for two a penny in Italy, but the head of a great family and the descendant of a condottiere who had carved out a principality for himself in the sixteenth century. She was a woman of sixty, a widow, and since the Fascist regime demanded too large a slice of her American income to suit her, she had left Italy and built herself, on a fine estate behind Cannes, a Florentine villa.She had brought marble from Italy with which to line the walls of her great reception rooms and imported painters to paint the ceilings.Her pictures, her bronzes, were uncommonly fine and even Elliott, though he didn't like Italian furniture, was obliged to admit that hers was magnificent.The gardens were lovely and the swimming-pool must have cost a small fortune.She entertained largely and you never sat down less than twenty at table.She had arranged to give a fancy-dress party on the night of the August full moon, and although it was still three weeks ahead nothing else was being talked of on the Riviera.There were to be fireworks and she was bringing down a coloured orchestra from Paris.The exiled royalties were telling one another with envious admiration that it would cost her more than they had to live on for a year.

“It's princely，”they said.

“It's crazy，”they said.

“It's in bad taste，”they said.

“What are you going to wear?”Elliott asked me.

“But I told you, Elliott, I'm not going. You don't think I'm going to dress myself up in fancy dress at my time of life.”

“She hasn't asked me，”he said hoarsely.

He looked at me with haggard eyes.

“Oh, she will，”I said coolly.“I dare say all the invitations haven't gone out yet.”

“She's not going to ask me.”His voice broke.“It's a deliberate insult.”

“Oh, Elliott, I can't believe that. I'm sure it's an oversight.”

“I'm not a man that people overlook.”

“Anyhow, you wouldn't have been well enough to go.”

“Of course I should. The best party of the season！If I were on my deathbed I'd get up for it.I've got the costume of my ancestor, the Count de Lauria, to wear.”

I did not quite know what to say and so remained silent.

“Paul Barton was in to see me just before you came，”Elliott said suddenly.

I cannot expect the reader to remember who this was, since I had to look back myself to see what name I had given him. Paul Barton was the young American whom Elliott had introduced into London society and who had aroused his hatred by dropping him when he no longer had any use for him.He had been somewhat in the public eye of late, first because he had adopted British nationality and then because he had married the daughter of a news-paper magnate who had been raised to the peerage.With this influence behind him and with his own adroitness it was evident that he would go far.Elliott was very bitter.

“Whenever I wake up in the night and hear a mouse scratching away in the wainscoat I say：‘That's Paul Barton climbing.'Believe me, my dear fellow, he'll end up in the House of Lords. Thank God, I shan't be alive to see it.”

“What did he want?”I asked, for I knew as well as Elliott that this young man did nothing for nothing.

“I'll tell you what he wanted，”said Elliott, snarling.“He wanted to borrow my Count de Lauria costume.”

“Nerve！”

“Don't you see what it means?It means he knew Edna hadn't asked me and wasn't going to ask me. She put him up to it.The old bitch.She'd never have got anywhere without me.I gave parties for her.I introduced her to everyone she knows.She sleeps with her chauffeur；you knew that of course.Disgusting！He sat there and told me that she's having the whole garden illuminated and there are going to be fireworks.I love fireworks.And he told me that Edna was being pestered by people who were asking for invitations, but she had turned them all down because she wanted the party to be really brilliant.He spoke as though there were no question of my being invited.”

“And are you lending him the costume?”

“I'd see him dead and in hell first. I'm going to be buried in it.”Elliott, sitting up in bed, rocked to and fro like a woman distraught.“Oh, it's so unkind，”he said.“I hate them, I hate them all.They were glad enough to make a fuss of me when I could entertain them, but now I'm old and sick they have no use for me.Not ten people have called to inquire since I've been laid up, and all this week only one miserable bunch of flowers.I’ve done every-thing for them.They’ve eaten my food and drunk my wine.I’ve run their errands for them.I’ve made their parties for them.I’ve turned myself inside out to do them favours.And what have I got out of it?Nothing, nothing, nothing.There’s not one of them who cares if I live or die.Oh, it’s so cruel.”He began to cry.Great heavy tears trickled down his withered cheeks.“I wish to God I’d never left America.”

It was lamentable to see that old man, with the grave yawning in front of him, weep like a child because he hadn't been asked to a party：shocking and at the same time almost intolerably pathetic.

“Never mind, Elliott，”I said，“it may rain on the night of the party. That'll bitch it.”

He caught at my words like the drowning man we've all heard about at a straw. He began to giggle through his tears.

“I've never thought of that. I'll pray to God for rain as I've never prayed before.You're quite right；that'll bitch it.”

I managed to divert his frivolous mind into another channel and left him, if not cheerful, at least composed. But I was not willing to let the matter rest, so on getting home I called up Edna Novemali and, saying I had to come to Cannes next day, asked if I could lunch with her.She sent a message that she'd be pleased but there'd be no party.Nevertheless when I arrived I found ten people there besides herself.She was not a bad sort, generous and hospitable, and her only grave fault was her malicious tongue.She could not help saying beastly things about even her intimate friends, but she did this because she was a stupid woman and knew no other way to make herself interesting.Since her slanders were repeated she was often not on speaking terms with the objects of her venom, but she gave good parties and most of them found it convenient after a while to forgive her.I did not want to expose Elliott to the humiliation of asking her to invite him to her big do, so waited to see how the land lay.She was excited about it and the conversation at luncheon was concerned with nothing else.

“Elliott will be delighted to have an opportunity to wear his Philip the Second costume，”I said as casually as I could.

“I haven't asked him，”she said.

“Why not?”I replied, with an air of surprise.

“Why should I?He doesn't count socially any more. He's a bore and a snob and a scandalmonger.”

Since these accusations could with equal truth be brought against her, I thought this a bit thick. She was a fool.

“Besides，”she added，“I want Paul to wear Elliott's costume. He'll look simply divine in it.”

I said nothing more, but determined by hook or by crook to get poor Elliott the invitation he hankered after. After luncheon Edna took her friends out into the garden.That gave me the chance I was looking for.On one occasion I had stayed in the house for a few days and knew its arrangement.I guessed that there would still be a number of invitation cards left over and that they would be in the secretary's room.I whipped along there, meaning to slip one in my pocket, write Elliott's name on it, and post it.I knew he was much too ill to go, but it would mean a great deal to him to receive it.I was taken aback when I opened the door to find Edna's secretary at her desk.I had expected her to be still at lunch.She was a middle-aged Scotch woman, called Miss Keith, with sandy hair, a freckled face, pince-nez, and an air of determined virginity.I collected myself.

“The Princess is taking the crowd around the garden, so I thought I'd come in and smoke a cigarette with you.”

“You're welcome.”

Miss Keith spoke with a Scotch burr and when she indulged in the dry humour which she reserved for her favourites she so broadened it as to make her remarks extremely amusing, but when you were overcome with laughter she looked at you with pained surprise as though she thought you daft to see anything funny in what she said.

“I suppose this party is giving you a hell of a lot of work. Miss Keith，”I said.

“I don't know whether I'm standing on my head or on my heels.”

Knowing I could trust her, I went straight to the point.

“Why hasn't the old girl asked Mr. Templeton?”

Miss Keith permitted a smile to cross her grim features.

“You know what she is. She's got a down on him.She crossed his name out on the list herself.”

“He's dying, you know. He'll never leave his bed again.He's awfully hurt at being left out.”

“If he wanted to keep in with the Princess he'd have been wiser not to tell everyone that she goes to bed with her chauffeur. And him with a wife and three children.”

“And does she?”

Miss Keith looked at me over her pince-nez.

“I've been a secretary for twenty-one years, my dear sir, and I've made it a rule to believe all my employers as pure as the driven snow. I'll admit that when one of my ladies found herself three months gone in the family way when his lordship had been shooting lions in Africa for six, my faith was sorely tried, but she took a little trip to Paris, a very expensive little trip it was too, and all was well.Her ladyship and I shared a deep sigh of relief.”

“Miss Keith, I didn't come here to smoke a cigarette with you, I came to snitch an invitation card and send it to Mr. Templeton myself.”

“That would have been a very unscrupulous thing to do.”

“Granted. Be a good sport, Miss Keith.Give me a card.He won't come and it'll make the poor old man happy.You've got nothing against him, have you?”

“No, he's always been very civil to me. He's a gentleman, I will say that for him, and that's more than you can say for most of the people who come here and fill their fat bellies at the Princess's expense.”

All important persons have about them someone in a subordinate position who has their ear. These dependents are very susceptible to slights, and, when they are not treated as they think they should be, will by well-directed shafts, constantly repeated, poison the minds of their patrons against those who have provoked their animosity.It is well to keep in with them.This Elliott knew better than anybody and he had always a friendly word and a cordial smile for the poor relation, the old maidservant or the trusted secretary.I was sure he had often exchanged pleasant badinage with Miss Keith and at Christmas had not forgotten to send her a box of chocolates, a vanity case, or a handbag.

“Come on, Miss Keith, have a heart.”

Miss Keith fixed her pince-nez more firmly on her prominent nose.

“I am sure you wish me to do nothing disloyal to my employer, Mr. Maugham, besides which the old cow would fire me if she found out I'd disobeyed her.The cards are on the desk in their envelopes.I am going to look out of the window, partly to stretch my legs which are cramped from sitting too long in one position and also to observe the beauty of the prospect.What happens when my back is turned neither God nor man can hold me responsible for.”

When Miss Keith resumed her seat the invitation was in my pocket.

“It's been nice to see you, Miss Keith，”I said, holding out my hand.“What are you wearing at the fancy-dressparty?”

“I am a minister's daughter, my dear sir，”she replied.“I leave such foolishness to the upper classes. When I have seen that the representatives of the Herald and the Mail get a good supper and a bottle of our second-best champagne, my duties will be terminated and I shall retire to the privacy of my bedchamber with a detective story.”

A couple of days later, when I went to see Elliott, I found him beaming.

“Look，”he said，“I've had my invitation. It came this morning.”

He took the card out from under his pillow and showed it to me.

“It's what I told you，”I said.“You see, your name begins with a T. The secretary has evidently only just reached you.”

“I h a v e n'tans we red yet.I'll do it to morrow.”

I had a moment's fright at that.

“Would you like me to answer it for you?I could post it when I leave you.”

“No, why should you?I'm quite capable of answering invitations myself.”

Fortunately, I thought, the envelope would be opened by Miss Keith and she would have the sense to suppress it. Elliott rang the bell.

“I want to show you my costume.”

“You're not thinking of going, Elliott?”

“Of course I am. I haven't worn it since the Beaumont's ball.”

Joseph answered the bell and Elliott told him to bring the costume. It was in a large flat box, wrapped in tissue paper.There were long white silk hose, padded trunks of cloth of gold slashed with white satin, a doublet to match, a cloak, a ruff to wear round the neck, a flat velvet cap, and a long gold chain from which hung the order of the Golden Fleece.I recognized it as a copy of the gorgeous dress worn by Philip the Second in Titian's portrait at the Prado, and when Elliott told me it was exactly the costume the Count de Lauria had worn at the wedding of the King of Spain with the Queen of England I could not but think that he was giving rein to his imagination.

On the following morning while I was having breakfast I was called to the telephone. It was Joseph to tell me that Elliott had had another bad attack during the night and the doctor, hurriedly summoned, doubted whether he would last through the day.I sent for the car and drove over to Antibes.I found Elliott unconscious.He had resolutely refused to have a nurse, but I found one there, sent for by the doctor from the English hospital between Nice and Beaulieu, and was glad to see her.I went out and telegraphed to Isabel.She and Gray were spending the summer with the children at the inexpensive seaside resort of La Baule.It was a long journey and I was afraid they would not get to Antibes in time.Except for her two brothers, whom he had not seen for years, she was Elliott's only living relative.

But the will to live was strong in him, or it may be that the doctor's medicaments were effective, for during the course of the day he rallied. Though shattered, he put on a bold front and amused himself by asking the nurse indecent questions about her sex life.I stayed with him most of the afternoon, and next day, on going to see him again, found him, though very weak, sufficiently cheerful.The nurse would only let me stay with him a short time.I was worried at not having received an answer to my telegram.Not knowing Isabel's address at La Baule I had sent it to Paris and feared that the concierge had delayed to forward it.It was not till two days later that I got a reply to say that they were starting at once.As ill luck would have it, Gray and Isabel were on a motor trip in Brittany and had only just had my wire.I looked up the trains and saw that they could not arrive for at least thirty-six hours.

Early next morning Joseph called me again to tell me that Elliott had had a very bad night and was asking for me. I hurried over.When I arrived Joseph took me aside.

“Monsieur will excuse me if I speak to him on a delicate subject，”he said to me.“I am of course a freethinker andbelieve all religion is nothing but a conspiracy of the priests to gain control over the people, but Monsieur knows what women are. My wife and the chambermaid insist that the poor gentleman should receive the last sacraments and evidently the time is growing short.”He looked at me in rather a shamefaced way.“And the fact remains, one never knows, perhaps it is better, if one's got to die, to regularize one's situation with the Church.”

I understood him perfectly. However freely they mock, most Frenchmen, when the end comes, prefer to make their peace with the faith that is part of their blood and bones.

“Do you want me to suggest it to him?”

“If Monsieur would have the goodness.”

It was not a job I much fancied, but after all Elliott had been for many years a devout Catholic, and it was fitting that he should conform to the obligations of his faith. I went up to his room.He was lying on his back, shrivelled and wan, but perfectly conscious.I asked the nurse to leave us alone.

“I'm afraid you're very ill, Elliott，”I said.“I was wondering, I was wondering if you wouldn't like to see a priest?”

He looked at me for a minute without answering.

“D'you mean to say I'm going to die?”

“Oh, I hope not. But it's just as well to be on the safe side.”

“I understand.”

He was silent. It is a terrible moment when you have to tell someone what I had just told Elliott.I could not look at him.I clenched my teeth because I was afraid I was going to cry.I was sitting on the edge of the bed, facing him, with my arm outstretched for support.

He patted my hand.

“Don't be upset, my dear fellow. Noblesse oblige, you know.”

I laughed hysterically.

“You ridiculous creature, Elliott.”

“That's better. Now call up the bishop and say that I wish to make my confession and receive Extreme Unction.I would be grateful if he'd send the Abbé Charles.He’s a friend of mine.”

The Abbé Charles was the bishop’s vicar general whom I had occasion to mention before.I went downstairs and telephoned.I spoke to the bishop himself.

“Is it urgent?”he asked.

“Very.”

“I will attend to it at once.”

The doctor arrived and I told him what I had done. He went up with the nurse to see Elliott and I waited on the ground floor in the dining-room.It is only twenty minutes'drive from Nice to Antibes and little more than half an hour later a black sedan drew up at the door.Joseph came to me.

“C'est Monseigneur en personne, Monsieur，”he said in a flurry.“It's the bishop himself.”

I went out to receive him. He was not as usual accompanied by his vicar general, but, why I did not know, by a young abbé who bore a casket that contained, I supposed, the utensils needed to administer the sacrament.The chauffeur followed with a shabby black valise.The bishop shook hands with me and presented his companion.

“How is our poor friend?”

“I'm afraid he's very ill, Monseigneur.”

“Will you be so obliging as to show us into a room where we can enrobe?”

“The dining-room is here, Monseigneur, and the drawing-room is on the next floor.”

“The dining-room will do very well.”

I ushered him in. Joseph and I waited in the hall.Presently the door opened and the bishop came out, followed by the abbé holding in both hands the chalice surmounted by a little platter on which lay the consecrated wafer.They were covered by a cambric napkin so fine that it was transparent.I had never seen the bishop but at a dinner or luncheonparty, and a very good trencherman he was, who enjoyed his food and a glass of good wine, telling funny and sometimes ribald stories with verve.He had struck me then as a sturdy, thickset man of no more than average height.Now, in surplice and stole, he looked not only tall, but stately.His red face, puckered as a rule with malicious yet kindly laughter, was grave.There was in his appearance nothing left of the cavalry officer he had once been；he looked, what indeed he was, a great dignitary of the Church.I was hardly surprised to see Joseph cross himself.The bishop inclined his head in a slight bow.

“Conduct me to the sick man，”he said.

I made way for him to ascend the stairs before me, but he bade me precede him. We went up in solemn silence.I entered Elliott's room.

“The bishop has come himself, Elliott.”

Elliott struggled to raise himself to a sitting position.

“Monseigneur, this is an honour I did not venture to expect.”

“Do not move, my friend.”The bishop turned to the nurse and me.“Leave us.”And then to the abbé：“I will call you when I am ready.”

The abbé glanced around and I guessed that he was looking for a place to set down the chalice.I pushed aside the tortoiseshell-backed brushes on the dressing-table.The nurse went downstairs and I led the abbé into the adjoining room which Elliott used as a study.The windows were open to the blue sky and he went over and stood by one of them.I sat down.A race of Stars was in progress and their sails gleamed dazzling white against the azure.A big schooner with a black hull, her red sails spread, was beating up against the breeze towards the harbour.I recognized her for a lobster boat, bringing a catch from Sardinia to supply the gala dinners at the casinos with a fish course.Through the closed door I could hear the muffled murmur of voices.Elliott was making his confession.I badly wanted a cigarette, but feared the abbé would be shocked if I lit one.He stood motionless, looking out, a slender young man, and his thick waving black hair, his fine dark eyes, his olive skin revealed his Italian origin.There was the quick fire of the South in his aspect and I asked myself what urgent faith, what burning desire had caused him to abandon the joys of life, the pleasures of his age, and the satisfaction of his senses, to devote himself to the service of God.

Suddenly the voices in the next room were still and I looked at the door. It was opened and the bishop appeared.

“Venez，”he said to the priest.

I was left alone. I heard the bishop's voice once more and I knew he was saying the prayers that the Church has ordained should be said for the dying.Then there was another silence and I knew that Elliott was partaking of the body and the blood of Christ.From I know not what feeling, inherited, I suppose, from far-away ancestors, though not a Catholic I can never attend Mass without a sense of tremulous awe when the little tinkle of the servitor's bell informs me of the Elevation of the Host；and now, similarly, I shivered as though a cold wind ran through me, I shivered with fear and wonder.The door was opened once more.

“You may come in，”said the bishop.

I entered. The abbé was spreading the cambric napkin over the cup and the little gilt plate on which the consecrated wafer had lain.Elliott’s eyes shone.

“Conduct Monseigneur to his car，”he said.

We descended the stairs. Joseph and the maids were waiting in the hall.The maids were crying.There were three of them and one after the other they came forward and, dropping to their knees, kissed the bishop's ring.He blessed them with two fingers.Joseph's wife nudged him and he advanced, fell to his knees too, and kissed the ring.The bishop smiled faintly.

“You are a freethinker, my son?”

I could see Joseph making an effort over himself.

“Yes, Monseigneur.”

“Do not let it trouble you. You have been a good and faithful servant to your master.God will overlook the errorsof your understanding.”

I went out into the street with him and opened the door of his car. He gave me a bow as he stepped in and smiled indulgently.

“Our poor friend is very low. His defects were of the surface；he was generous of heart and kindly towards his fellow men.”

Thinking that Elliott might want to be alone after the ceremony in which he had taken part, I went up to the drawing-room and began to read, but no sooner had I settled myself than the nurse came in to tell me that he wanted to see me. I climbed the flight of stairs to his room.Whether owing to a shot that the doctor had given him to help him to support the Ordeal before him or whether from the excitement of it, he was calmly cheerful and his eyes were bright.

“A great honour, my dear fellow，”he said.“I shall enter the kingdom of heaven with a letter of introduction from a prince of the Church. I fancy that all doors will be open to me.”

“I'm afraid you'll find the company very mixed，”I smiled.

“Don't you believe it, my dear fellow. We know from Holy Writ that there are class distinctions in heaven just as there are on earth.There are seraphim and cherubim, archangels and angels.I have always moved in the best society in Europe and I have no doubt that I shall move in the best society in heaven.Our Lord has said：The House of my Father hath many mansions.It would be highly unsuitable to lodge the hoi polloi in a way to which they're entirely unaccustomed.”

I suspected that Elliott saw the celestial habitations in the guise of the châteaux of a Baron de Rothschild with eighteenth-century panelling on the walls, Buhl tables, marquetry cabinets, and Louis Quinze suites covered with their original petit-point.

“Believe me, my dear fellow，”he went on after a pause，“there'll be none of this damned equality in heaven.”

He dropped off quite suddenly into a doze. I sat down with a book.He slept off and on.At one o'clock the nurse came in to tell me that Joseph had luncheon ready for me.Joseph was subdued.

“Fancy Monseigneur the Bishop coming himself. It is a great honour he has done our poor gentleman.You saw me kiss his ring?”

“I did.”

“It's not a thing I would have done of myself！I did it to satisfy my poor wife.”

I spent the afternoon in Elliott's room. In the course of it a telegram came from Isabel to say that she and Gray would arrive by the Blue Train next morning.I could hardly hope they would be in time.The doctor came.He shook his head.Towards sunset Elliott awoke and was able to take a little nourishment.It seemed to give him a momentary strength.He beckoned to me and I went up to the bed.His voice was very weak.

“I haven't answered Edna's invitation.”

“Oh, don't bother about that now, Elliott.”

“Why not?I've always been a man of the world；there's no reason why I should forget my manners as I'm leaving it. Where is the card?”

It was on the chimney piece and I put it in his hand, but I doubt whether he could see it.

“You'll find a pad of writing paper in my study. If you'll get it I'll dictate my answer.”

I went into the next room and came back with writing materials. I sat down by the side of his bed.

“Are you ready?”

“Yes.”

His eyes were closed, but there was a mischievous smile on his lips and I wondered what was coming.

“Mr. Elliott Templeton regrets that he cannot accept Princess Novemali's kind invitation owing to a previousengagement with his Blessed Lord.”

He gave a faint, ghostly chuckle. His face was of a strange blue-white, ghastly to behold, and he exhaled the nauseating stench peculiar to his disease.Poor Elliott who had loved to spray himself with the perfumes of Chanel and Molyneux.He was still holding the purloined invitation card and, thinking it incommoded him, I tried to take it out of his hand, but he tightened his grip on it.I was startled to hear him speak quite loudly.

“The old bitch，”he said.

These were the last words he spoke. He sank into a coma.The nurse had been up with him all the previous night and looked very tired, so I sent her to bed, promising to call her if necessary, and said I would sit up.There was indeed nothing to do.I lit a shaded lamp and read till my eyes ached and then, turning it off, I sat in darkness.The night was warm and the windows wide open.At regular intervals the flash of the lighthouse swept the room with a passing glimmer.The moon, which when full would look upon the vacuous, noisy gaiety of Edna Novemali's fancy-dress party, set, and in the sky, a deep, deep blue, the countless stars shone with their terrifying brilliance.I think I may have dropped off into a light sleep, but my senses were still awake, and I was suddenly startled into intense consciousness by a hurried, angry sound, the most awe-inspiring sound anyone can hear, the death rattle.I went over to the bed and by the gleam of the lighthouse felt Elliott's pulse.He was dead.I lit the lamp by his bedside and looked at him.His jaw had fallen.His eyes were open and before closing them I stared into them for a minute.I was moved and I think a few tears trickled down my cheeks.An old, kind friend.It made me sad to think how silly, useless, and trivial his life had been.It mattered very little now that he had gone to so many parties and had hobnobbed with all those princes, dukes, and counts.They had forgotten him already.

I saw no reason to wake the exhausted nurse, so I returned to my chair by the window. I was asleep when she came in at seven.I left her to do whatever she thought fit and had breakfast, then I went to the station to meet Gray and Isabel.I told them that Elliott was dead, and since there was no room for them in his house asked them to stay with me, but they preferred to go to a hotel.I went back to my own house to have a bath, shave, and change.

In the course of the morning Gray called me to say that Joseph had given them a letter addressed to me that Elliott had entrusted to him. Since it might contain something for my eyes alone I said I would drive over at once, and so less than an hour later I once more entered the house.The letter, marked on the envelope：To be delivered immediately after my death, contained instruc-tions for his obsequies.I knew that he had set his heart on being buried in the church that he had built and I had already told Isabel.He wished to be embalmed and mentioned the name of the firm to which the commission should be given.“I have made inquiries，”he continued，“and I am informed that they make a very good job of it.I trust you to see that it is not scamped.I desire to be dressed in the dress of my ancestor the Count de Lauria, with his sword by my side and the order of the Golden Fleece on my breast.I leave the choice of my coffin to you.It should be unpretentious but suitable to my posi-tion.In order to give no one unnecessary trouble I desire that Thomas Cook and Son should make all arrangements for the transportation of my remains and that one of their men should accompany the coffin to its final resting-place.”

I remembered that Elliott had said he wanted to be buried in that fancy dress of his, but I had taken it for a passing whim and hadn't thought he meant it seriously. Joseph was insistent that his wishes be carried out and there seemed no reason why they should not be.The body was duly embalmed and then I went with Joseph to dress it in those absurd clothes.It was a gruesome business.We slipped his long legs into the white silk hose and pulled the cloth-of-gold over them.It was a job to get his arms through the sleeves of the doublet.We fixed the great starched ruff and draped the satin cape over his shoulders.Finally we placed the flat velvet cap on his head and the collar of the Golden Fleece round his neck.The embalmer had rouged his cheeks and reddened his lips.Elliott, the costume too large now for his emaciated frame, looked like a chorus man in an early opera of Verdi's.The sad Don Quixote of a worthless purpose.When the undertaker's men had put him in the coffin I laid the property sword down the length of his body, between his legs, with his hands on the pommel as I have seen the sword laid on the sculptured tomb of a Crusader.

Gray and Isabel went to Italy to attend the funeral.





CHAPTER SIX


1


I feel it right to warn the reader that he can very well skip this chapter without losing the thread of such story as I have to tell, since for the most part it is nothing more than the account of a conversation that I had with Larry. I should add, however, that except for this conversation I should perhaps not have thought it worth while to write this book.





2


That autumn, a couple of months after Elliott's death, I spent a week in Paris on my way to England. Isabel and Gray, after their grim journey to Italy, had returned to Brittany, but were now once more settled in the apartment in the Rue St.Guillaume.She told me the details of his will.He had left a sum of money for Masses to be said for his soul in the church he had built and a further sum for its upkeep.He had bequeathed a handsome amount to the Bishop of Nice to be spent on charitable purposes.He had left me the equivocal legacy of his eighteenth-century pornographic library and a beautiful drawing by Fragonard of a satyr engaged with a nymph on a performance that is usually conducted in private.It was too indecent to hang on my walls and I am not one to gloat upon obscenity in private.He had provided generously for his servants.His two nephews were to have ten thousand dollars each, and the residue of his estate went to Isabel.What this amounted to she did not tell me and I did not inquire；I gathered from her complacency that it was quite a lot of money.

For long, ever since he had regained his health, Gray had been impatient to go back to America and get to work again, and though Isabel was comfortable enough in Paris, his restlessness had affected her too. He had for some time been in communication with his friends, but the best opening that presented itself was contingent on his putting in a considerable amount of capital.That he had not got, but Elliott's death had put Isabel in possession of very much more than was needed；and Gray with her approval was starting negotiations with the view, if everything turned out as well as it was presented, of leaving Paris and going to look into the matter for himself.But before that was possible there was much to attend to.They had to come to a reasonable agreement with the French Treasury over the inheritance tax.They had to get rid of the house at Antibes and the apartment in the Rue St.Guillaume.They had to arrange for a sale at the Hôtel Drouot of Elliott’s furniture, pictures, and drawings.These were valuable and it seemed wise to wait till spring when the great collectors were likely to be in Paris.Isabel was not sorry to spend another winter there；the children by now could chatter French as easily as they could chatter English and she was glad to let them have a few more months at a French school.They had grown in three years and were now long-legged, skinny, vivacious little creatures, with little at present of their mother’s beauty, but with nice manners and an insatiable curiosity.

So much for that.





3


I met Larry by chance. I had asked Isabel about him and she told me that since their return from La Baule they hadseen little of him.She and Gray had by now made a number of friends for themselves, people of their own generation, and they were more often engaged than during the pleasant weeks when the four of us were so much together.One evening I went to the Théâtre Français to see Bérénice.I had read it of course, but had never seen it played, and since it is seldom given I was unwilling to miss the opportunity.It is not one of Racine’s best plays, for the subject is too tenuous to support five acts, but it is moving and contains passages that are justly famous.The story is founded on a brief passage in Tacitus：Titus, who loved Bérénice, Queen of Palestine, with passion and who had even, as was supposed, promised her marriage, for reasons of state sent her away from Rome during the first days of his reign in despite of his desires and in despite of hers.For the Senate and the people of Rome were violently opposed to their Emperor’s alliance with a foreign queen.The play is concerned with the struggle in his breast between love and duty, and when he falters, it is Bérénice who in the end, assured that he loves her, confirms his purpose and separates herself from him for ever.

I suppose only a Frenchman can appreciate to the full the grace and grandeur of Racine and the music of his verse, but even a foreigner, once he has accustomed himself to the periwigged formality of the style, can hardly fail to be moved by his passionate tenderness and by the nobility of his sentiment. Racine knew as few have done how much drama is contained in the human voice.To me at all events the roll of those mellifluous Alexandrines is a sufficient substitute for action, and I find the long speeches, worked up with infinite skill to the expected climax, every bit as thrilling as any hair-raising adventure of the movies.

There was an interval after the third act and I went out to smoke a cigarette in the foyer over which presides Houdon's Voltaire with his toothless, sardonic grin. Someone touched me on the shoulder.I turned round, perhaps with a slight movement of annoyance, for I wanted to be left with the exaltation with which those sonorous lines had filled me, and saw Larry.As always, I was glad to see him.It was a year since I had set eyes on him, and I suggested that at the end of the play we should meet and have a glass of beer together.Larry said he was hungry, for he had had no dinner, and proposed that we should go to Montmartre.We found one another in due course and stepped out into the open.The Théâtre Français has a musty fug that is peculiar to it.It is impregnated with the body odour of those unnumbered generations of sour-faced, unwashed women called ouvreuses who show you to your seat and domineeringly await their tip.It was a relief to get into the fresh air, and since the night was fine we walked.The arc lamps in the Avenue de I’Opéra glared so defiantly that the stars above, as though too proud to compete, shrouded their brightness in the dark of their infinite distance.As we walked we spoke of the performance we had just seen.Larry was disappointed.He would have liked it to be more natural, the lines spoken as people naturally speak and the gestures less theatrical.I thought his point of view mistaken.It was rhetoric, magnificent rhetoric, and I had a notion that it should be spoken rhetorically.I liked the regular thump of the rhymes；and the stylized gestures, handed down in a long tradition, seemed to me to suit the temper of that formal act.I could not but think that that was how Racine would have wished his play to be played.I had admired the way in which the actors had contrived to be human, passionate, and true within the limitations that confined them.Art is triumphant when it can use convention as an instrument of its own purpose.

We reached the Avenue de Clichy and went into the Brasserie Graf. It was not long past midnight and the room was crowded, but we found a table and ordered ourselves eggs and bacon.I told Larry I had seen Isabel.

“Gray will be glad to get back to America，”he said.“He's a fish out of water here. He won't be happy till he's at work again.I dare say he'll make a lot of money.”

“If he does it'll be due to you. You not only cured him in body, but in spirit as well.You restored his confidence in himself.”

“I did very little. I merely showed him how to cure himself.”

“How did you learn to do that little?”

“By accident. It was when I was in India.I'd been suffering from insomnia and happened to mention it to an old Yogi I knew and he said he'd soon settle that.He did just what you saw me do with Gray and that night I slept as I hadn't slept for months.And then, a year later it must have been, I was in the Himalayas with an Indian friend of mineand he sprained his ankle.It was impossible to get a doctor and he was in great pain.I thought I'd try to do what the old Yogi had done, and it worked.You can believe it or not, he was completely relieved of the pain.”Larry laughed.“I can assure you, no one was more surprised than I.There's nothing to it really；it only means putting the idea into the sufferer’s mind.”

“Easier said than done.”

“Would it surprise you if your arm raised itself from the table without any volition of yours?”

“Very much.”

“It will. My Indian friend told people what I'd done when we got back to civilization and he brought others to see me.I hated doing it, because I couldn't quite understand it, but they insisted.Somehow or other I did them good.I found I was able to relieve people not only of pain but of fear.It's strange how many people suffer from it.I don't mean fear of closed spaces and fear of heights, but fear of death and, what's worse, fear of life.Often they’re people who seem in the best of health, prosperous, without any worry, and yet they’re tortured by it.I’ve sometimes thought it was the most besetting humour of men, and I asked myself at one time if it was due to some deep animal instinct that man has inherited from that primeval some-thing that first felt the thrill of life.”

I was listening to Larry with expectation, for it was not often that he spoke at any length, and I had an inkling that for once he felt communicative. Perhaps the play we had just seen had released some inhibition and the rhythm of its sonorous cadences, as music will, had overcome his instinctive reserve.Suddenly I realized that something was happening to my hand.I had not given another thought to Larry's half-laughing question.I was conscious that my hand no longer rested on the table, but was raised an inch above it without my willing it.I was taken aback.I looked at it and saw that it trembled slightly.I felt a queer tingling in the nerves of my arm, a little jerk, and my hand and forearm lifted of themselves, I to the best of my belief neither aiding nor resisting, until they were several inches from the table.Then I felt my whole arm being raised from the shoulder.

“This is very odd，”I said.

Larry laughed. I made the slightest effort of will and my hand fell back on to the table.

“It's nothing，”he said.“Don't attach any importance to it.”

“Were you taught that by the Yogi you spoke to us about when you first came back from India?”

“Oh no, he had no patience with that kind of thing. I don't know whether he believed that he possessed the powers that some Yogis claim to have, but he would have thought it puerile to exercise them.”

Our eggs and bacon arrived and we ate them with good appetite. We drank our beer.Neither of us spoke.Larry was thinking of I knew not what and I was thinking of him.We finished.I lit a cigarette and he lit a pipe.

“What made you go to India in the first place?”I asked abruptly.

“Chance. At least I thought so at the time.Now I'm inclined to think it was the inevitable outcome of my years in Europe.Almost all the people who've had most effect on me I seem to have met by chance, yet looking back it seems as though I couldn't but have met them.It's as if they were waiting there to be called upon when I needed them.I went to India because I wanted a rest.I'd been working very hard and wished to sort out my thoughts.I got a job as a deck hand on one of those pleasure-cruise ships that go around the world.It was going to the East and through the Panama Canal to New York.I hadn’t been to America for five years and I was homesick.I was depressed.You know how ignorant I was when we first met in Chicago all those years ago.I’d read an awful lot in Europe and seen a lot, but I was no nearer than when I started to what I was looking for.”

I wanted to ask him what that was, but had a feeling that he'd just laugh, shrug his shoulders, and say it was a matter of no consequence.

“But why did you go as a deck hand?”I asked instead.“You had money.”

“I wanted the experience. Whenever I've got water-logged spiritually, whenever I've absorbed all I can for the time, I've found it useful to do something of that sort.That winter, after Isabel and I broke off our engagement, I worked in a coal-mine near Lens for six months.”

It was then that he told me of those incidents that I have narrated in a previous chapter.

“Were you sore when Isabel threw you over?”

Before he answered he looked at me for some time with those strangely black eyes of his that seemed then to look inwards rather than out.

“Yes. I was very young.I'd made up my mind that we were going to marry.I'd made plans for the life that we were going to lead together.I expected it to be lovely.”He laughed faintly.“But it takes two to make a marriage just as it takes two to make a quarrel.It had never occurred to me that the life I offered Isabel was a life that filled her with dismay.If I'd had any sense I'd never have suggested it.She was too young and ardent.I couldn't blame her.I couldn’t yield.”

It's just possible that the reader will remember that on his flight from the farm, after that grotesque encounter with the farmer's widowed daughter-in-law, he had gone to Bonn. I was anxious to get him to continue, but knew I must be careful not to ask more direct questions than I could help.

“I've never been to Bonn，”I said.“When I was a boy I spent some time as a student at Heidelberg. It was, I think, the happiest time of my life.”

“I liked Bonn. I spent a year there.I got a room in the house of the widow of one of the professors at the university who took in a couple of boarders.She and her two daughters, both of them middle-aged, did the cooking and the house-work.I found my fellow boarder was a Frenchman and I was disappointed at first because I wanted to speak nothing but German；but he was an Alsatian and he spoke German, if not more fluently, with a better accent than he spoke French.He was dressed like a German pastor and I was surprised to find out after a few days that he was a Benedictine monk.He's been granted leave of absence from his monastery to make researches at the university library.He was a very learned man, but he didn't look it any more than he looked like my idea of a monk.He was a tall, stout fellow, with sandy hair, prominent blue eyes, and a red, round face.He was shy and reserved and didn't seem to want to have anything much to do with me, but he was very polite in a rather elaborate way and always took a civil part in the conversation at table；I only saw him then；as soon as we had finished dinner he went back to work at the library, and after supper, when I sat in the parlour improving my German with whichever of the two daughters wasn't washing up, he retired to his room.

“I was surprised when one afternoon, after I'd been there at least a month, he asked me if I'd care to take a walk with him. He said he could show me places in the neighbourhood that he didn't think I'd be likely to discover for myself.I'm a pretty good walker, but he could outwalk me any day.We must have covered a good fifteen miles on that first walk.He asked me what I was doing in Bonn, and I said I’d come to learn German and get to know something about German literature.He talked very intelligently.He said he’d be glad to help me in any way he could.After that we went for walks two or three times a week.I discovered that he’d taught philosophy for some years.When I was in Paris I’d read a certain amount, Spinoza and Plato and Descartes, but I hadn’t read any of the great German philosophers and I was only too glad to listen while he talked about them.One day, when we’d made an excursion across the Rhine and were sitting in a beer-garden drinking a glass of beer, he asked me if I was a Protestant.

“‘I suppose so，'I said.

“He gave me a quick look and I thought I saw in his eyes the glimmer of a smile. He began to talk about Aeschylus；I'd been learning Greek, you know, and he knew the great tragedians as I could never hope to know them.It was inspiring to hear him.I wondered why he'd suddenly asked me that question.My guardian, Uncle Bob Nelson, was an agnostic, but he went to church regularly because his patients expected it of him and sent me to Sunday school for the same reason.Martha, our help, was a rigid Baptist and she used to frighten my childhood by telling me of the hell fire to which the sinner would be condemned to all eternity.She took a real delight in picturing to me the agonies that would be endured by the various people in the village whom for some reason or other she had had it in for.

“By winter I'd got to know Father Ensheim very well. I think he was rather a remarkable man.I never saw him vexed.He was good-natured and kindly, far more broad-minded than I would have expected, and wonderfully tolerant.His erudition was prodigious and he must have known how ignorant I was, but he used to talk to me as though I were as learned as he.He was very patient with me.He seemed to want nothing but to be of service to me.One day, I don't know why, I had an attack of lumbago, and Frau Grabau, my landlady, insisted on putting me to bed with hot-water-bottles.Father Ensheim, hearing I was laid up, came into my room to see me, after supper.Except that I was in a good deal of pain I felt perfectly well.You know what bookish people are, they're inquisitive about books, and as I put down the book I was reading when he came in, he took it up and looked at the title.It was a book about Meister Eckhart that I'd found at a bookseller's in the town.He asked me why I was reading it, so I said that I’d been going through a certain amount of mystical literature and told him about Kosti and how he’d aroused my interest in the subject.He surveyed me with his prominent blue eyes and there was a look in them that I can only describe as amused tender-ness.I had the feeling that he found me rather ridiculous, but felt so much loving-kindness towards me that he didn’t like me any the less.Anyhow, I’ve never much minded if people thought me a bit of a fool.

“‘What are you looking for in these books?'he asked me.

“‘If I knew that，'I answered，‘I'd at least be on the way to finding it.'

“‘Do you remember my asking you if you were a Protestant?You said you supposed so. What did you mean by that?'

“‘I was brought up as one，'I said.

“‘Do you believe in God?'he asked.

“I don't like personal questions and my first impulse was to tell him that was no business of his. But there was so much goodness in his aspect that I felt it impossible to affront him.I didn't know what to say；I didn't want to answer yes and I didn't want to answer no.It may have been the pain I was suffering that enabled me to speak or it may have been something in him.Anyhow, I told him about myself.”

Larry hesitated for a moment, and when he went on I knew he wasn't speaking to me but to the Benedictine monk. He had forgotten me.I don't know what there was in the time or the place that enabled him to speak, without my prompting, of what his natural reticence had so long concealed.

“Uncle Bob Nelson was very democratic and he sent me to the high school at Marvin. It was only because Louisa Bradley nagged him into it that when I was fourteen he let me go to St.Paul's.I wasn't very good at anything, either at work or games, but I fitted in all right.I think I was an entirely normal boy.I was crazy about aviation.Those were the early days of flying and Uncle Bob was as excited about it as I was.He knew some of the airmen, and when I said I wanted to learn to fly he said he'd fix it for me.I was tall for my age and when I was sixteen I could easily pass for eighteen.Uncle Bob made me promise to keep it a secret, because he knew everyone would be down on him like a ton of bricks for letting me go, but as a matter of fact he helped me to get over to Canada and gave me a letter to someone he knew, and the result was that by the time I was seventeen I was flying in France.

“They were terrible gimcrack planes we flew in then, and you practically took your life in your hands each time you went up. The heights we got to were absurd, judged by present standards, but we didn't know any better and thought it wonderful.I loved flying.I couldn't describe the feeling it gave me, I only knew I felt proud and happy.In the air, way up, I felt that I was part of something very great and very beautiful.I didn't know what it was all about, I only knew that I wasn't alone any more, by myself as I was, two thousand feet up, but that I belonged.I can't help it if it sounds silly.When I was flying above the clouds and they were like an enormous flock of sheep below me I felt that I was at home with infinitude.”

Larry paused. He gazed at me from the caverns of his impenetrable eyes, but I did not know whether he saw me.

“I'd known that men had been killed by the hundred thousand, but I hadn't seen them killed. It didn't mean very much to me.Then I saw a dead man with my own eyes.The sight filled me with shame.”

“Shame?”I exclaimed involuntarily.

“Shame, because that boy, he was only three or four years older than me, who'd had such energy and daring, who a moment before had had so much vitality, who'd been so good, was now just mangled flesh that looked as if it had neverbeen alive.”

I didn't say anything. I had seen dead men when I was a medical student and I had seen many more during the war.What had dismayed me was how trifling they looked.There was no dignity in them.Marionettes that the show-man had thrown into the discard.

“I didn't sleep that night. I cried.I wasn't frightened for myself；I was indignant；it was the wickedness of it that broke me.The war came to an end and I went home.I'd always been keen on mechanics, and if there was nothing doing in aviation, I'd intended to get into an automobile factory.I'd been wounded and had to take it easy for a while.Then they wanted me to go to work.I couldn’t do the sort of work they wanted me to do.It seemed futile.I’d had a lot of time to think.I kept on asking myself what life was for.After all it was only by luck that I was alive；I wanted to make something of my life, but I didn’t know what.I’d never thought much about God.I began to think about Him now.I couldn’t understand why there was evil in the world.I knew I was very ignorant；I didn’t know anyone I could turn to and I wanted to learn, so I began to read at haphazard.

“When I told Father Ensheim all this he asked me：‘Then you've been reading for four years?Where have you got?'

“‘Nowhere，'I said.

“He looked at me with such an air of radiant benignity that I was confused. I didn't know what I'd done to arouse so much feeling in him.He softly drummed his fingers on the table as though he were turning a notion over in his mind.

“‘Our wise old Church，'he said then，‘has discovered that if you will act as if you believed belief will be granted to you；if you pray with doubt, but pray with sincerity, your doubt will be dispelled；if you will surrender yourself to the beauty of that liturgy the power of which over the human spirit has been proved by the experience of the ages, peace will descend upon you. I am returning to my monastery in a little while.Why don't you come and spend a few weeks with us?You can work in the fields with our lay brothers；you can read in our library.It will be an experience no less interesting than working in a coal mine or on a German farm.'

“‘Why do you suggest it?'I asked.

“‘I've been observing you for three months，'he said.‘Perhaps I know you better than you know yourself. The distance that separates you from faith is no greater than the thickness of a cigarette paper.'

“I didn't say anything to that. It gave me a funny sort of feeling, as though someone had got hold of my heartstrings and were giving them a tug.At last I said I'd think about it.He dropped the subject.For the rest of Father Ensheim's stay in Bonn we never spoke of anything connected with religion again, but as he was leaving he gave me the address of his monastery and told me if I made up my mind to come I had only to write him a line and he'd make arrangements.I missed him more than I expected.The year wore on and it was midsummer.I liked it well enough in Bonn.I read Goethe and Schiller and Heine.I read Hölderlin and Rilke.Still I wasn’t getting any-where.I thought a lot of what Father Ensheim had said, and at last I decided to accept his offer.

“He met me at the station. The monastery was in Alsace and the country was pretty.Father Ensheim presented me to the abbot and then showed me to the cell that had been assigned to me.It had a narrow iron bed, a crucifix on the wall, and by way of furniture only the barest necessities.The dinner bell rang and I made my way to the refectory.It was a huge vaulted chamber.The abbot stood at the door with two monks, one of whom held a basin and the other a towel, and the abbot sprinkled a few drops of water on the hands of the guests by way of washing them and dried them with the towel one of the two monks handed him.There were three guests besides myself, two priests who were passing that way and had stopped off for dinner and an elderly, grouchy Frenchman who was making a retreat.

“The abbot and the two priors, senior and junior, sat at the head of the room, each at his separate table；the fathers along two sides of the walls, while the novices, the lay brothers, and the guests sat at tables in the middle. Grace was said and we ate.A novice took up his position near the refectory door and in a monotonous voice read from an edifying work.When we had finished grace was said again.The abbot, Father Ensheim, the guests, and the monk in charge of them went into a small room where we had coffee and talked of casual things.Then I went back to my cell.

“I stayed there three months. I was very happy.The life exactly suited me.The library was good and I read a great deal.None of the fathers tried in any way to influence me, but they were glad to talk to me.I was deeply impressed by their learning, their piety, and their unworldliness.You mustn't think it was an idle life they led.They were constantly occupied.They farmed their own land and worked it themselves and they were glad to have my help.I enjoyed the splendour of the services, but the one I liked best of all was Matins.It was at four in the morning.It was wonderfully moving to sit in the church with the night all around you while the monks, mysterious in their habits, their cowls drawn over their heads, sang with their strong male voices the plain-song of the liturgy.There was something reassuring in the regularity of the daily round, and notwithstanding all the energy that was displayed, notwithstanding the activity of thought, you had an abiding sense of repose.”

Larry smiled a trifle ruefully.

“Like Rolla, I've come too late into a world too old. I should have been born in the Middle Ages when faith was a matter of course；then my way would have been clear to me and I'd have sought to enter the order.I couldn't believe.I wanted to believe, but I couldn't believe in a God who wasn't better than the ordinary decent man.The monks told me that God had created the world for his glorification.That didn’t seem to me a very worthy object.Did Beethoven create his symphonies for his glorification?I don’t believe it.I believe he created them because the music in his soul demanded expression and then all he tried to do was to make them as perfect as he knew how.

“I used to listen to the monks repeating the Lord's Prayer；I wondered how they could continue to pray without misgiving to their heavenly father to give them their daily bread. Do children beseech their earthly father to give them sustenance?They expect him to do it, they neither feel nor need to feel gratitude to him for doing it, and we have only blame for a man who brings children into the world that he can't or won't provide for.It seemed to me that if an omnipotent creator was not prepared to provide his creatures with the necessities of existence, material and spiritual, he'd have done better not to create them.”

“Dear Larry，”I said，“I think it's just as well you weren't born in the Middle Ages. You'd undoubtedly have perished at the stake.”

He smiled.

“You've had a great deal of success，”he went on.“Do you want to be praised to your face?”

“It only embarrasses me.”

“That's what I should have thought. I couldn't believe that God wanted it either.We didn't think much in the air corps of a fellow who wangled a cushy job out of his CO by buttering him up.It was hard for me to believe that God thought much of a man who tried to wangle salvation by fulsome flattery.I should have thought the worship most pleasing to him was to do your best according to your lights.

“But that wasn't the chief thing that bothered me：I couldn't reconcile myself with that preoccupation with sin which, so far as I could tell, was never entirely absent from the monks'thoughts. I'd known a lot of fellows in the air corps.Of course they got drunk when they got a chance, and had a girl whenever they could, and used foul language；we had one or two bad hats：one fellow was arrested for passing rubber cheques and was sent to prison for six months；it wasn't altogether his fault；he’d never had any money before, and when he got more than he’d ever dreamt of having, it went to his head.I’d known bad men in Paris, and when I got back to Chicago I knew more, but for the most part their badness was due to heredity, which they couldn’t help, or to their environment, which they didn’t choose：I’m not sure that society wasn’t more responsible for their crimes than they were.If I’d been God I couldn’t have brought myself to condemn one of them, not even the worst, to eternal damnation.Father Ensheim was broad-minded；he thought that hell was the deprivation of God’s presence, but if that is such an intoler-able punishment that it can justly be called hell, can one conceive that a good God can inflict it?After all, He created men：if He so created them that it was possible for them to sin, it was because He willed it.If I trained a dog to fly at the throat of any stranger who came into my back yard, it wouldn’t be fair to beat him when he did so.

“If an all-good and all-powerful God created the world, why did He create evil?The monks said, so that man byconquering the wickedness in him, by resisting temptation, by accepting pain and sorrow and misfortune as the trials sent by God to purify him, might at long last be made worthy to receive His grace. It seemed to me like sending a fellow with a message to some place and just to make it harder for him you constructed a maze that he had to get through, then dug a moat that he had to swim, and finally built a wall that he had to scale.I wasn't prepared to believe in an all-wise God who hadn't common sense.I didn't see why you shouldn't believe in a God who hadn't created the world, but had to make the best of the bad job he’d found, a being enormously better, wiser, and greater than man, who strove with the evil he hadn’t made and who you hoped might in the end overcome it.But on the other hand, I didn’t see why you should.

“Those good fathers had no answers that satisfied either my head or my heart to the questions that perplexed me. My place was not with them.When I went to say good-bye to Father Ensheim he didn't ask me whether I had profited by the experience in the way he had been so sure I would.He looked at me with inexpressible kindness.

“‘I'm afraid I've been a disappointment to you, Father，'I said.

“‘No，'he answered.‘You are a deeply religious man who doesn't believe in God. God will seek you out.You'll come back.Whether here or elsewhere only God can tell.'”

“I settled down in Paris for the rest of the winter. I knew nothing of science, and I thought the time had come when I must acquire at least a nodding acquaintance with it.I read a lot.I don't know that I learnt much except that my ignorance was abysmal.But I knew that before.When the spring came I went to the country and stayed at a little inn on a river near one of those beautiful old French towns where life doesn't seem to have moved for two hundred years.”

I guessed that this was the summer Larry had spent with Suzanne Rouvier, but I did not interrupt him.

“After that I went to Spain. I wanted to see Velasquez and El Greco.I wondered if art could point out the way to me that religion hadn't.I wandered about a bit and then came to Seville.I liked it and thought I'd spend the winter there.”

I had myself been to Seville when I was twenty-three and I, too, had liked it. I liked its white, tortuous streets, its cathedral, and the wide-spreading plain of the Guadalquivir；but I liked also those Andalusian girls with their grace and their gaiety, with their dark shining eyes, the carnation in their hair stressing its blackness and by the contrast itself more vivid；I liked the rich colour of their skins and the inviting sensuality of their lips.Then indeed to be young was very heaven.When Larry went there he was only a little older than I had been and I could not but ask myself whether it was possible that he had remained indifferent to the lure of those enchanting creatures.He answered my unspoken question.

“I ran across a French painter I'd known in Paris, a fellow called Auguste Cottet, who'd kept Suzanne Rouvier at one time. He'd come to Seville to paint and was living with a girl he'd picked up there.He asked me to go with them one evening to Eretania to listen to a flamenco singer and they brought along with them a friend of hers.She was the prettiest little thing you ever saw.She was only eighteen.She'd got into trouble with a boy and had had to leave her native village because she was going to have a baby.The boy was doing his military service.After she had the baby she put it out to nurse and got a job in the tobacco factory.I took her home with me.She was very gay and very sweet, and after a few days I asked her if she’d like to come and live with me.She said she would, so we took a couple of rooms in a casa de huéspedes, a bedroom and a sitting-room.I told her she could leave her job, but she didn’t want to, and that suited me because it left me my days to myself.We had the run of the kitchen, so she used to make my breakfast for me before she went to work and then at midday she’d come back and cook the lunch and in the evening we’d dine at a restaurant and go to a movie or to some place to dance.She looked upon me as a lunatic because I had a rubber bath and insisted on having a cold sponge every morning.The baby was farmed out in a village a few miles from Seville and we used to go and see it on Sundays.She made no secret of the fact that she was living with me to make enough money tofurnish the lodging in a tenement they were going to take when her boy friend was through with his military service.She was a dear little thing and I’m sure she’s made her Paco a good wife.She was cheerful, good-tempered, and affectionate.She looked upon what you delicately call sexual congress as a natural function of the body like any other.She took pleasure in it and she was happy to give pleasure.She was of course a little animal, but a very nice, attractive, domesticated animal.

“Then one evening she told me that she'd had a letter from Paco in Spanish Morocco, where he was doing his service, to say that he was to be released and would arrive in Cadiz in a couple of days. She packed her belongings next morning and slipped her money in her stocking and I took her to the station.She gave me a hearty kiss as I put her into the railway carriage, but she was too excited at the thought of seeing her lover again to have a thought for me and I'm sure that before the train was out of the station she'd forgotten my existence.

“I stayed on in Seville and in the fall I set out on the journey that landed me in India.”

It was getting late. The crowd had thinned out and only a few tables were occupied.The people who had been sitting there because they had nothing else to do had gone home.Those who had been to a play or a picture and had come to have a drink or a bite to eat had left.Now and then latecomers straggled in.I saw a tall man, evidently an Englishman, come in with a young rough.He had the long, washed-out face with thinning wavy hair of the British intellectual and evidently suffered from the delusion common to many that when you are abroad no one you know at home can possibly recognize you.The young rough greedily ate a great plate of sandwiches while his companion watched him with amused benevolence.What an appetite.I saw one man whom I knew by sight because he went to the same barber's at Nice.He was stout, elderly, and grey-haired, with a puffy red face and heavy pouches under his eyes.He was a Middle Western banker who had left his native city after the crash rather than face an investigation.I do not know whether he had committed any crime；if he had, he was perhaps too small fry to put the authorities to the trouble of getting him extradited.He had a pompous manner and the false heartiness of a cheap politician, but his eyes were frightened and unhappy.He was never quite drunk and never quite sober.He was always with some harlot who was obviously getting all she could out of him, and he was now with two painted middle-aged women who treated him with a mockery they didn't trouble to conceal while he, only half understanding what they said, giggled fatuously.The gay life！I wondered if he wouldn't have done better to stay at home and take his medicine.One day his women would have squeezed him dry and then there would be nothing left for him but the river or an overdose of veronal.

Between two and three there was a slight increase of custom and I supposed that the night clubs were closing their doors. A bunch of young Americans strolled in, very drunk and noisy, but they didn't stay long.Not far from us two fat, sombre women, tightly fitted into mannish clothes, sat side by side, drinking whiskies and sodas in gloomy silence.A party in evening dress put in an appearance, what they call in French gens du monde, who had evidently been doing the rounds and now wanted a spot of supper to finish up with.They came and went.My curiosity had been excited by a little man, quietly dressed, who had been sitting there for an hour or more with a glass of beer in front of him reading the paper.He had a neat black beard and wore pince-nez.At last a woman came in and joined him.He gave her a nod devoid of friendliness and I conjectured that he was annoyed because she had kept him waiting.She was young, rather shabby, but heavily painted, and looked very tired.Presently I noticed her take something out of her bag and hand it to him.Money.He looked at it and his face darkened.He addressed her in words I could not hear, but from her manner I guessed they were abusive, and she seemed to be making excuses.Suddenly he leant over and gave her a resounding smack on the cheek.She gave a cry and began to sob.The manager, drawn by the disturbance, came up to see what was the matter.It looked as if he were telling them to get out if they couldn't behave.The girl turned on him and shrilly, so that one heard every word, told him in foul language to mind his own business.

“If he slapped my face it's because I deserved it，”she cried.

Women！I had always thought that to live on a woman's immoral earnings you must be a strapping flashy fellow with sex appeal, ready with your knife or your gun；it was astonishing that such a puny creature, who might have been a lawyer's clerk from his appearance, could get a footing in such an overcrowded profession.

The waiter who had served us was going off duty and to get his tip presented the bill. We paid and ordered coffee.

“Well?”I said.

I felt that Larry was in the mood to talk and I knew that I was in the mood to listen.

“Aren't I boring you?”

“No.”

“Well, we got to Bombay. The ship was stopping there for three days to give the tourists a chance to see the sights and make excursions.On the third day I got the afternoon off and went ashore.I walked about for a while, looking at the crowd：what a conglomeration！Chinese, Mohammedans, Hindus, Tamils as black as your hat；and those great humped bullocks with their long horns that draw the carts！Then I went to Elephanta to see the caves.An Indian had joined us at Alexandria for the passage to Bombay and the tourists were rather sniffy about him.He was a fat little man with a brown round face and he wore a thick tweed suit of black and green check and a clerical collar.I was having a breath of air on deck one night and he came up and spoke to me.I didn't want to talk to anyone just then, I wanted to be alone；he asked me a lot of questions and I'm afraid I was rather short with him.Anyhow I told him I was a student working my passage back to America.

“‘You should stop off in India，'he said.‘The East has more to teach the West than the West conceives.'

“‘Oh yes?'I said.

“‘At any rate，'he went on，‘be sure you go and see the caves at Elephanta. You'll never regret it.'”Larry interrupted himself to ask me a question.“Have you ever been to India?”

“Never.”

“Well, I was looking at the colossal image with its three heads which is the great sight at Elephanta and wondering what it was all about when I heard someone behind me say：‘I see you've taken my advice.'I turned round and it took me a minute to realize who it was that had spoken to me. It was the little man in the heavy check suit and the clerical collar, but now he was wearing a long saffron robe, the robe, I knew later, of the Ramakrishna Swamis；and instead of the funny, spluttering little guy he'd been before, he was dignified and rather splendid.We both stared at the colossal bust.

“‘Brahma, the Creator，'he said.‘Vishnu the Preserver, and Siva the Destroyer. The three manifestations of the Ultimate Reality.'

“‘I'm afraid I don't quite understand，'I said.

“‘I'm not surprised，'he answered, with a little smile on his lips and a twinkle in his eyes, as though he were gently mocking me.‘A God that can be understood is no God. Who can explain the Infinite in words?'

“He joined the palms of his hands together and with just the indication of a bow strolled on. I stayed looking at those three mysterious heads.Perhaps because I was in a receptive mood, I was strangely stirred.You know how sometimes you try to recall a name；it's on the tip of your tongue, but you just can't get it：that was the feeling I had then.When I came out of the caves I sat for a long while on the steps and looked at the sea.All I knew about Brahminism were those verses of Emerson's and I tried to remember them.It exasperated me that I couldn't and when I went back to Bombay I went into a bookshop to see if I could find a volume of poetry that had them in.They're in the Oxford Book of English Verse.D’you remember them?

They reckon ill who leave me out；

When me they fly, I am the wings；

I am the doubter and the doubt，

And I the hymn the Brahmin sings.

“I had supper in a native eating-house and then, as I didn't have to be on board till ten, I went and walked on the Maidan and looked at the sea. I thought I'd never seen so many stars in the sky.The cool was delicious after the heat of the day.I found a public garden and sat on a bench.It was very dark there and silent white figures flitted to and fro.That wonderful day, with the brilliant sunshine, the coloured, noisy crowds, the smell of the East, acrid and aromatic, enchanted me；and like an object, a splash of colour that a painter puts in to pull his composition together, those three enormous heads of Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva gave a mysterious significance to it all.My heart began to beat like mad, because I'd suddenly become aware of an intense conviction that India had something to give me that I had to have.It seemed to me that a chance was offered to me and I must take it there and then or it would never be offered me again.I made up my mind quickly.I decided not to go back to the ship.I'd left nothing there but a few things in a grip.I walked slowly back to the native quarter and looked about for a hotel.I found one after a while and took a room.I had the clothes I stood up in, some loose cash, my passport, and my letter of credit.I felt so free, I laughed out loud.

“The ship was sailing at eleven and just to be on the safe side I stayed in my room till then. I went down to the quay and watched her pull out.After that I went to the Ramakrishna Mission and routed out the Swami who'd spoken to me at Elephanta.I didn't know his name, but I explained that I wanted to see the Swami who'd just arrived from Alexandria.I told him I'd decided to stay in India and asked him what I ought to see.We had a long talk and at last he said he was going to Benares that night and asked me if I'd like to go with him.I jumped at it.We went third-class.The carriage was full of people eating and drinking and talking and the heat was terrific.I didn’t get a wink of sleep and next morning I was pretty tired, but the Swami was as fresh as a daisy.I asked him how come and he said：‘By meditation on the formless one；I found rest in the Absolute.’I didn’t know what to think, but I could see with my own eyes that he was as alert and wide awake as though he’d had a good night’s sleep in a comfortable bed.

“When at last we got to Benares a young man of my own age came to meet my companion and the Swami asked him to find me a room. His name was Mahendra and he was a teacher at the university.He was a nice, kindly, intelligent fellow and he seemed to take as great a fancy to me as I took to him.That evening he took me out in a boat on the Ganges；it was a thrill for me, very beautiful with the city crowding down to the water's edge, and awe-inspiring；but next morning he had something better to show me, he fetched me at my hotel before dawn and took me out on the river again.I saw something I could never have believed possible, I saw thousands upon thousands of people come down to take their lustral bath and pray.I saw one tall gaunt fellow, with a mass of tangled hair and a great ragged beard, with nothing but a jock-strap to cover his nakedness, stand with his long arms outstretched, his head up, and in a loud voice pray to the rising sun.I can't tell you what an impression it made on me.I spent six months in Benares and I went over and over again on the Ganges at dawn to see that strange sight.I never got over the wonder of it.Those people believed not halfheartedly, not with reservation or uneasy doubt, but with every fibre of their being.

“Everyone was very kind to me. When they discovered I hadn't come to shoot tigers or to buy or sell anything, but only to learn, they did everything to help me.They were pleased that I should wish to learn Hindustani, and found teachers for me.They lent me books.They were never tired of answering my questions.Do you know anything about Hinduism?”

“Very little，”I answered.

“I should have thought it would interest you. Can there be anything more stupendous than the conception that the universe has no beginning and no end, but passes everlastingly from growth to equilibrium, from equilibrium to decline, from decline to dissolution, from dissolution to growth, and so on to all eternity?”

“And what do the Hindus think is the object of this endless recurrence?”

“I think they'd say that such is the nature of the Absolute. You see, they believe that the purpose of creation is toserve as a stage for the punishment or reward of the deeds of the soul's earlier existence.”

“Which presupposes belief in the transmigration of souls.”

“It's a belief held by two thirds of the human race.”

“The fact that a great many people believe something is no guarantee of its truth.”

“No, but at least it makes it worthy of consideration. Christianity absorbed so much of Neo-Platonism, it might very easily have absorbed that too, and in point of fact there was an early Christian sect that believed in it, but it was declared heretical.Except for that Christians would believe in it as confidently as they believe in the resurrection of Christ.”

“Am I right in thinking that it means that the soul passes from body to body in an endless course of experience occasioned by the merit or demerit of previous works?”

“I think so.”

“But you see, I'm not only my spirit but my body, and who can decide how much I, my individual self, am conditioned by the accident of my body?Would Byron have been Byron but for his club foot, or Dostoyevsky Dostoyevsky without his epilepsy?”

“The Indians wouldn't speak of an accident. They would answer that it's your actions in previous lives that have determined your soul to inhabit an imperfect body.”Larry drummed idly on the table and, lost in thought, gazed into space.Then, with a faint smile on his lips and a reflective look in his eyes, he went on.“Has it occurred to you that transmigration is at once an explanation and a justification of the evil of the world?If the evils we suffer are the result of sins committed in our past lives we can bear them with resignation and hope that if in this one we strive towards virtue our future lives will be less afflicted.But it's easy enough to bear our own evils, all we need for that is a little manliness；what's intolerable is the evil, often so unmerited in appearance, that befalls others.If you can persuade yourself that it is the inevitable result of the past you may pity, you may do what you can to alleviate, and you should, but you have no cause to be indignant.”

“But why didn't God create a world free from suffering and misery at the beginning when there was neither merit nor demerit in the individual to determine his actions?”

“The Hindus would say that there was no beginning. The individual soul, co-existent with the universe, has existed from all eternity and owes its nature to some prior existence.”

“And does the belief in the transmigration of souls have a practical effect on the lives of those who believe it?After all, that is the test.”

“I think it has. I can tell you of one man I knew personally on whose life it certainly had a very practical effect.The first two or three years I was in India I lived mostly in native hotels, but now and then someone asked me to stay with him and once or twice I lived in grandeur as the guest of a maharajah.Through one of my friends in Benares I got an invitation to stay in one of the smaller northern states.The capital was lovely：a rose-red city half as old as time.I was recommended to the Minister of Finance.He'd had a European education and had been to Oxford.When you talked to him you got the impression of a progressive, intelligent and enlightened man；and he had the reputation of being an extremely efficient minister and a clever, astute politician.He wore European clothes and was very natty in appearance.He was rather a nice-looking fellow, a little on the stout side as Indians tend to become in middle age, with a close-cropped, neat moustache.He often asked me to go to his house.He had a large garden and we'd sit under the shade of great trees and talk.He had a wife and two grown-up children.You'd have taken him for just the ordinary, rather commonplace Anglicized Indian and I was staggered when I found out that in a year, when he reached the age of fifty, he was going to resign his profitable position, dispose of his property to his wife and children, and go out into the world as a wandering mendicant.But the most surprising part was that his friends, and the maharajah, accepted it as a settled thing and looked upon it not as an extraordinary proceeding but as a natural one.

“One day I said to him：‘You, who are so liberal, who know the world, who've read so much, science, philosophy, literature-do you in your heart of hearts believe in reincarnation?'

“His whole face changed. It became the face of a visionary.

“‘My dear friend，'he said，‘if I didn't believe in it life would have no meaning for me.'”

“And do you believe in it, Larry?”I asked.

“That's a very difficult question to answer. I don't think it's possible for us Occidentals to believe in it as implicitly as these Orientals do.It's in their blood and bones.With us it can only be an opinion.I neither believe in it nor disbelieve in it.”

He paused for a moment and with his face resting on his hand looked down at the table. Then he leant back.

“I should like to tell you of a very strange experience I had once. I was practising meditation one night in my little room at the Ashrama as my Indian friends had taught me to do.I had lit a candle and was concentrating my attention on its flame, and after a time, through the flame, but quite clearly, I saw a long line of figures one behind the other.The foremost was an elderly lady in a lace cap with grey ringlets that hung down over her ears.She wore a tight black bodice and a black silk flounced skirt-the sort of clothes, I think, they wore in the seventies-and she was standing full face to me in a gracious, diffident attitude, her arms hanging straight down her sides with the palms towards me.The expression on her lined face was kindly, sweet, and mild.Immediately behind her, but sideways so that I saw his profile, with a great hooked nose and thick lips, was a tall gaunt Jew in a yellow gabardine with a yellow skullcap on his thick dark hair.He had the studious look of a scholar and an air of grim and at the same time passionate austerity.Behind him, but facing me and as distinct as though there were no one between us, was a young man with a cheerful ruddy countenance, whom you couldn't have taken for anything but an Englishman of the sixteenth century.He stood firmly on his feet, his legs a little apart, and he had a bold, reckless, wanton look.He was dressed all in red, grandly as though it were a court dress, with broad-toed velvet shoes on his feet and a flat velvet cap on his head.Behind those three there was an endless chain of figures, like a queue outside a movie house, but they were dim and I couldn't see what they looked like.I was only aware of their vague shapes and of the movement that passed through them like wheat waving in a summer breeze.In a little while, I don't know whether it was in a minute, or five, or ten, they faded slowly into the darkness of the night and there was nothing but the steady flame of the candle.”

Larry gave a little smile.

“Of course it may be that I'd fallen into a doze and dreamt. It may be that my concentration on that feeble flame had induced a sort of hypnotic condition in me and that those three figures that I saw as distinctly as I see you were recollections of pictures preserved in my subconscious.But it may be that they were myself in past lives.It may be that I was not so very long ago an old lady in New England and before that a Levantine Jew and somewhere back, soon after Sebastian Cabot had sailed from Bristol, a gallant at the Court of Henry Prince of Wales.”

“What eventually happened to your friend of the rose-red city?”

“Two years later I was down south at a place called Madura. One night in the temple someone touched me on the arm.I looked round and saw a bearded man with long black hair, dressed in nothing but a loincloth, with the staff and the begging-bowl of the holy man.It was not till he spoke that I recognized him.It was my friend.I was so astounded that I didn't know what to say.He asked me what I'd been doing and I told him；he asked me where I was going and I said to Travancore；he told me to go and see Shri Ganesha.‘He will give you what you're looking for，'he said.I asked him to tell me about him, but he smiled and said I'd find out all that was necessary for me to know when I saw him.I’d got over my surprise by then and asked him what he was doing in Madura.He said he was making a pilgrimage on foot to the holy places of India.I asked him how he ate and how he slept.He told me that when anyone offered him shelter he slept on the veranda, but otherwise under a tree or in the precincts of a temple；and as for food, if people offered him a meal he ate it and if they didn’t he went without.I looked at him：‘You’ve lost weight，’I said.He laughed and answered that he felt all the better for it.Then he said good-bye to me-it was funny to hear that guy in a loincloth say，‘Well, so long, old chap’—and stepped into that part of the temple where I couldn’t follow him.

“I stayed in Madura for some time. I think it's the only temple in India in which the white man can walk about freely so long as he doesn't enter the holy of holies.At nightfall it was packed with people.Men, women, and children.The men, stripped to the waist, wore dhoties, and their foreheads, and often their chests and arms, were thickly smeared with the white ash of burnt cow dung.You saw them making obeisance at one shrine or another and sometimes lying full length on the ground, face downwards, in the ritual attitude of prostration.They prayed and recited litanies.They called to one another, greeted one another, quarrelled with one another, heatedly argued with one another.There was an ungodly row, and yet in some mysterious way God seemed to be near and living.

“You pass through long halls, the roof supported by sculptured columns, and at the foot of each column a religious mendicant is seated；each has in front of him a bowl for offerings or a small mat on which the faithful now and again throw a copper coin. Some are clad；some are almost naked.Some look at you vacantly as you pass；some are reading, silently or aloud, and appear unconscious of the streaming throng.I looked for my friend among them；I never saw him again.I suppose he proceeded on the journey to his goal.”

“And what was that?”

“Liberation from the bondage of rebirth. According to the Vedantists the self, which they call the atman and we call the soul, is distinct from the body and its senses, distinct from the mind and its intelligence；it is not part of the Absolute, for the Absolute, being infinite, can have no parts, but the Absolute itself.It is uncreated；it has existed from eternity and when at last it has cast off the seven veils of ignorance will return to the infinitude from which it came.It is like a drop of water that has arisen from the sea and in a shower has fallen into a puddle, then drifts into a brook, finds its way into a stream, after that into a river, passing through mountain gorges and wide plains, winding this way and that, obstructed by rocks and fallen trees, till at last it reaches the boundless sea from which it rose.”

“But that poor little drop of water, when it has once more become one with the sea, has surely lost its individuality.”

Larry grinned.

“You want to taste sugar, you don't want to become sugar. What is individuality but the expression of our egoism?Until the soul has shed the last trace of that it cannot become one with the Absolute.”

“You talk very familiarly of the Absolute, Larry, and it's an imposing word. What does it actually signify to you?”

“Reality. You can't say what it is；you can only say what it isn't.It's inexpressible.The Indians call it Brahman.It's nowhere and everywhere.All things imply and depend upon it.It's not a person, it’s not a thing, it’s not a cause.It has no qualities.It transcends permanence and change；whole and part, finite and infinite.It is eternal because its completeness and perfection are unrelated to time.It is truth and freedom.”

“Golly！”I said to myself, but to Larry：“But how can a purely intellectual conception be a solace to the suffering human race?Men have always wanted a personal God to whom they can turn in distress for comfort and encourage-ment.”

“It may be that at some far distant day greater insight will show them that they must look for comfort and encouragement in their own souls. I myself think that the need to worship is no more than the survival of an old remembrance of cruel gods that had to be propitiated.I believe that God is within me or nowhere.If that's so, whom or what am I to worship-myself?Men are on different levels of spiritual development, and so the imagination of India has evolved the manifestations of the Absolute that are known as Brahma, Vishnu, Siva, and by a hundred other names.The Absolute is in Isvara, the creator and ruler of the world, and it is in the humble fetish before which the peasant in his sun-baked field places the offering of a flower.The multitudinous gods of India are but expedients to lead to the realization that the self is one with the supreme self.”

I looked at Larry reflectively.

“I wonder just what it was that attracted you to this austere faith，”I said.

“I think I can tell you. I've always felt that there was something pathetic in the founders of religion who made it a condition of salvation that you should believe in them.It's as though they needed your faith to have faith in themselves.They remind you of those old pagan gods who grew wan and faint if they were not sustained by the burnt offerings of the devout.Advaita doesn't ask you to take anything on trust；it asks only that you should have a passionate craving to know Reality；it states that you can experience God as surely as you can experience joy or pain.And there are men in Indiatoday-hundreds of them for all I know-who have the certitude that they have done so.I found something wonderfully satisfying in the notion that you can attain Reality by knowledge.In later ages the sages of India in recognition of human infirmity admitted that salvation may be won by the way of love and the way of works, but they never denied that the noblest way, though the hardest, is the way of knowledge, for its instrument is the most precious faculty of man, his reason.”

I must interrupt myself to make it plain that I am not attempting here to give anything in the nature of a description of the philosophical system known as Vedanta. I have not the knowledge to do so, but even if I had this would not be the proper place for it.Our conversation was a long one and Larry told me a great deal more than I have felt it possible to set down in what after all purports to be a novel.My concern is with Larry.I should not have touched on such an intricate subject at all except that it seemed to me that without at least some slight account of his speculations and the singular experiences that were perhaps occasioned by them I could not give plausibility to the line of conduct which he was led to adopt and with which I shall presently acquaint the reader.It irks me that I cannot hope with any words of mine to give an idea of the pleasantness of his voice that invested even his most casual utterances with persuasiveness, or of the constant change in his expression, from grave to gently gay, from reflective to playful, that accompanied his thoughts like the ripple of a piano when the violins with a great sweep sing the several themes of a concerto.Although he spoke of serious things he spoke of them quite naturally, in a conversational tone, with a certain diffidence, perhaps, but without any more constraint than if he had been speaking of the weather and the crops.If I have given the impression that there was anything didactic in his manner the fault is mine.His modesty was as evident as his sincerity.

There was no more than a sprinkling of people in the café.The roisterers had long since departed.The sad creatures who make a business of love had gone to their sordid dwellings.Now and then a tired-looking man came in to have a glass of beer and a sandwich, or one, who seemed only half awake, for a cup of coffee.White-collar workers.One had been on a night shift and was going home to bed；the other, roused by the call of an alarm clock, was on his unwilling way to the long day’s labour.Larry appeared as unconscious of the time as of the surroundings.I have found myself in the course of my life in many strange situations.More than once I have been within a hair’s breadth of death.More than once I have touched hands with romance and known it.I have ridden a pony through Central Asia along the road that Marco Polo took to reach the fabulous lands of Cathay；I have drunk a glass of Russian tea in a prim parlour in Petrograd while a soft-spoken little man in a black coat and striped trousers told me how he had assassinated a grand duke；I have sat in a drawing-room in Westminster and listened to the serene geniality of a piano trio of Haydn’s while the bombs were crashing without；but I do not think I have ever found myself in a stranger situation than when I sat on the red-plush seats of that garish restaurant for hour after hour while Larry talked of God and eternity, of the Absolute and the weary wheel of endless becoming.

Larry had been silent for a few minutes, and unwilling to hurry him, I waited. Presently he gave me a friendly little smile as though he had suddenly once more become aware of me.

“When I got down to Travancore I found I needn't have asked for information about Shri Ganesha. Everyone knew of him.For many years he'd lived in a cave in the hills, but finally he'd been persuaded to move down to the plain where some charitable person had given him a plot of land and had built a little adobe house for him.It was a long way from Trivandrum, the capital, and it took me all day, first by train and then by bullock cart, to get to the Ashrama.I found a young man at the entrance of the compound and asked him if I could see the Yogi.I'd brought with me the basket of fruit which is the customary gift to offer.In a few minutes the young man came back and led me into a longhall with windows all around it.In one corner Shri Ganesha sat in the attitude of meditation on a raised dais covered with a tiger skin.‘I've been expecting you，’he said.I was surprised, but supposed my friend of Madura had told him something about me.But he shook his head when I mentioned his name.I presented my fruit and he told the young man to take it away.We were left alone and he looked at me without speaking.I don’t know how long the silence lasted.It might have been for half an hour.I’ve told you what he looked like；what I haven’t told you is the serenity that he irradiated, the goodness, the peace, the selflessness.I was hot and tired after my journey, but gradually I began to feel wonderfully rested.Before he’d said another word I knew that this was the man I’d been seeking.”

“Did he speak English?”I interrupted.

“No. But, you know, I'm pretty quick at languages, I'd picked up enough Tamil to understand and make myself understood in the South.At last he spoke.

“‘What have you come here for?'he asked.

“I began to tell him how I'd come to India and how I'd passed my time for three years；how, on report of their wisdom and sanctity, I'd gone to one holy man after another and had found no one to give me what I looked for. He interrupted me.

“‘All that I know. There is no need to tell me.What have you come here for?'

“‘So that you may be my Guru，'I answered.

“‘Brahman alone is the Guru，'he said.

“He continued to look at me with a strange intensity and then suddenly his body became rigid, his eyes seemed to turn inwards, and I saw that he'd fallen into the trance which the Indians call Samadhi and in which they hold the duality of subject and object vanishes and you become Knowledge Absolute. I was sitting cross-legged on the floor, in front of him, and my heart beat violently.After how long a time I don't know he sighed and I realized that he had recovered normal consciousness.He gave me a glance sweet with loving-kindness.

“‘Stay，'he said.‘They will show you where you may sleep.'

“I was given as a dwelling-place the shack in which Shri Ganesha had lived when first he came down to the plain. The hall in which he now passed both day and night had been built when disciples gathered around him and more and more people, attracted by his fame, came to visit him.So that I mightn't be conspicuous I adopted the comfortable Indian dress and I got so sunburnt that unless your attention was drawn to me you might have taken me for a native.I read a great deal.I meditated.I listened to Shri Ganesha when he chose to talk；he didn't talk very much, but he was always willing to answer questions and it was wonderfully inspiring to listen to him.It was like music in your ears.Though in his youth he had himself practised very severe austerities he did not enjoin them on his disciples.He sought to wean them from the slavery of selfhood, passion, and sense, and told them that they could acquire liberation by tranquillity, restraint, renunciation, resignation, by steadfastness of mind and by an ardent desire for freedom.People used to come from the nearby town three or four miles away, where there was a famous temple to which great crowds flocked once a year for a festival；they came from Trivandrum and from far-off places to tell him their troubles, to ask his advice, to listen to his teaching；and all went away strengthened in soul and at peace with themselves.What he taught was very simple.He taught that we are all greater than we know and that wisdom is the means to freedom.He taught that it is not essential to salvation to retire from the world, but only to renounce the self.He taught that work done with no selfish interest purifies the mind and that duties are opportunities afforded to man to sink his separate self and become one with the universal self.But it wasn't his teaching that was so remarkable；it was the man himself, his benignity, his greatness of soul, his saintliness.His presence was a benediction.I was very happy with him.I felt that at last I had found what I wanted.The weeks, the months passed with unimaginable rapidity.I proposed to stay either till he died, and he told us that he did not intend very much longer to inhabit his perishable body, or till I received illumination, the state when you have at last burst the bonds of ignorance, and know with a certainty there is no disputing that you and the Absolute are one.”

“And then?”

“Then, if what they say is true, there is nothing more. The soul's course on earth is ended and it will return no more.”

“And is Shri Ganesha dead?”I asked.

“Not so far as I know.”

As he spoke he saw what was implied in my question and gave a light laugh. He went on after a moment's hesitation, but in such a manner as led me at first to suppose that he wished to avoid answering the second question that he well knew was on the tip of my tongue, the question, of course, whether he had received illumination.

“I didn't stay at the Ashrama continuously. I was lucky enough to make the acquaintance of a native forestry officer whose permanent residence was on the outskirts of a village at the foot of the mountains.He was a devotee of Shri Ganesha and when he could get away from his work came and spent two or three days with us.He was a nice fellow and we had long talks.He liked to practise his English on me.After I'd known him for some time, he told me that the forestry service had a bungalow up in the mountains and if ever I wanted to go there to be by myself he would give me the key.I went there now and then.It was a two-day journey；first you had to go by bus to the forestry officer's village, then you had to walk, but when you got there it was magnificent in its grandeur and its solitude.I took what I could in a knapsack on my back and hired a bearer to carry provisions for me, and I stayed till they were exhausted.It was only a log cabin with a cookhouse behind it and for furniture there was nothing but a trestle bed on which to put your sleeping-mat, a table, and a couple of chairs.It was cool up there and at times it was pleasant to light a fire at night.It gave me a wonderful thrill to know that there wasn't a living soul within twenty miles of me.At night I used often to hear the roar of a tiger or the racket of elephants as they crashed through the jungle.I used to take long walks in the forest.There was one place where I loved to sit because from it I saw the mountains spread before me and below, a lake to which at dusk the wild animals, deer, pig, bison, elephant, leopard came to drink.

“When I'd been at the Ashrama just two years I went up to my forest retreat for a reason that'll make you smile. I wanted to spend my birthday there.I got there the day before.Next morning I awoke before dawn and I thought I'd go and see the sunrise from the place I've just told you about.I knew the way blindfold.I sat down under a tree and waited.It was night still, but the stars were pale in the sky, and day was at hand.I had a strange feeling of suspense.So gradually that I was hardly aware of it light began to filter through the darkness, slowly, like a mysterious figure slinking between the trees.I felt my heart beating as though at the approach of danger.The sun rose.”

Larry paused and a rueful smile played on his lips.

“I have no descriptive talent, I don't know the words to paint a picture；I can't tell you, so as to make you see it, how grand the sight was that was displayed before me as the day broke in its splendour. Those mountains with their deep jungle, the mist still entangled in the treetops, and the bottomless lake far below me.The sun caught the lake through a cleft in the heights and it shone like burnished steel.I was ravished with the beauty of the world.I'd never known such exaltation and such a transcendent joy.I had a strange sensation, a tingling that arose in my feet and travelled up to my head, and I felt as though I were suddenly released from my body and as pure spirit partook of a loveliness I had never conceived.I had a sense that a knowledge more than human possessed me, so that everything that had been confused was clear and everything that had perplexed me was explained.I was so happy that it was pain and I struggled to release myself from it, for I felt that if it lasted a moment longer I should die；and yet it was such rapture that I was ready to die rather than forgo it.How can I tell you what I felt?No words can tell the ecstasy of my bliss.When I came to myself I was exhausted and trembling.I fell asleep.

“It was high noon when I woke. I walked back to the bungalow, and I was so light at heart that it seemed to me that I hardly touched the ground.I made myself some food, gosh, I was hungry, and I lit my pipe.”

Larry lit his pipe now.

“I dared not think that this was illumination that I, Larry. Darrell of Marvin, Illinois, had received when others striving for it for years, with austerity and mortification, still waited.”

“What makes you think that it was anything more than a hypnotic condition induced by your state of mindcombined with the solitude, the mystery of the dawn, and the burnished steel of your lake?”

“Only my overwhelming sense of its reality. After all it was an experience of the same order as the mystics have had all over the world through all the centuries, Brahmins in India, Sufis in Persia, Catholics in Spain, Protestants in New England；and so far as they've been able to describe what defies description they've described it in similar terms.It's impossible to deny the fact of its occurrence；the only difficulty is to explain it.If I was for a moment one with the Absolute or if it was an inrush from the subconscious of an affinity with the universal spirit which is latent in all of us, I wouldn't know.”

Larry paused for an instant and threw me a quizzical glance.

“By the way, can you touch your little finger with your thumb?”he asked.

“Of course，”I said with a laugh, proving it with the appropriate action.

“Are you aware that that's something that only man and the primates can do?It's because the thumb is opposable to the other digits that the hand is the admirable instrument it is. Isn't it possible that the opposable thumb, doubtless in a rudimentary form, was developed in the remote ancestor of man and the gorilla in certain individuals, and was a characteristic that only became common to all after innumerable generations?Isn't it at least possible that these experiences of oneness with Reality that so many diverse persons have had point to a development in the human consciousness of a sixth sense which in the far, far future will be common to all men so that they may have as direct a perception of the Absolute as we have now of the objects of sense?”

“And how would you expect that to affect them?”I asked.

“I can as little tell you that as the first creature that found it could touch its little finger with its thumb could have told you that infinite consequences were entailed in that insignificant action. So far as I'm concerned I can only tell you that the intense sense of peace, joy, and assurance that possessed me in that moment of rapture abides with me still and that the vision of the world's beauty is as fresh and vivid now as when first my eyes were dazzled by it.”

“But Larry, surely your idea of the Absolute forces you to believe that the world and its beauty are merely an illusion-the fabric of Maya.”

“It's a mistake to think that the Indians look upon the world as an illusion；they don't；all they claim is that it's not real in the same sense as the Absolute. Maya is only a speculation devised by those ardent thinkers to explain how the Infinite could produce the Finite.Samkara, the wisest of them all, decided that it was an insoluble mystery.You see, the difficulty is to explain why Brahman, which is Being, Bliss, and Intelligence, which is unalterable, which ever is and forever maintains itself in rest, which lacks nothing and needs nothing and so knows neither change nor strife, which is perfect, should create the world.Well, if you ask that question the answer you're generally given is that the Absolute created the world in sport with-out reference to any purpose.But when you think of flood and famine, of earthquake and hurricane and all the ills that flesh is heir to, your moral sense is outraged at the idea that so much that is shocking can have been created in play.Shri Ganesha had too much kindliness of heart to believe that；he looked upon the world as the expression of the Absolute and as the overflow of its perfection.He taught that God cannot help creating and that the world is the manifestation of his nature.When I asked how, if the world was a manifestation of the nature of a perfect being, it should be so hateful that the only reasonable aim man can set before him is to liberate himself from its bondage, Shri Ganesha answered that the satisfactions of the world are transitory and that only the Infinite gives enduring happiness.But endless duration makes good no better, nor white any whiter.If the rose at noon has lost the beauty it had at dawn, the beauty it had then was real.Nothing in the world is permanent, and we're foolish when we ask anything to last, but surely we’re still more foolish not to take delight in it while we have it.If change is of the essence of existence one would have thought it only sensible to make it the premise of our philosophy.We can none of us step into the same river twice, but the river flows on and the other river we step into is cool and refreshing too.

“The Aryans when they first came down into India saw that the world we know is but an appearance of the world we know not；but they welcomed it as gracious and beautiful；it was only centuries later, when the exhaustion of conquest, when the debilitating climate had sapped their vitality so that they became a prey to invading hordes, that theysaw only evil in life and craved for liberation from its return. But why should we of the West, we Americans especially, be daunted by decay and death, hunger and thirst, sickness, old age, grief, and delusion?The spirit of life is strong in us.I felt more alive then, as I sat in my log cabin smoking my pipe, than I had ever felt before.I felt in myself an energy that cried out to be expended.It was not for me to leave the world and retire to a cloister, but to live in the world and love the objects of the world, not indeed for themselves, but for the Infinite that is in them.If in those moments of ecstasy I had indeed been one with the Absolute, then, if what they said was true, nothing could touch me and when I had worked out the karma of my present life I should return no more.The thought filled me with dismay.I wanted to live again and again.I was willing to accept every sort of life, no matter what its pain and sorrow；I felt that only life after life, life after life could satisfy my eagerness, my vigour, and my curiosity.

“Next morning I started down the mountain and the day after arrived at the Ashrama. Shri Ganesha was surprised to see me in European clothes.I'd put them on at the forestry officer's bungalow when I started uphill because it was colder there and hadn't thought to change them.

“‘I've come to bid you farewell, master，'I said.‘I am going back to my own people.'

“He did not speak. He was sitting, as ever, cross-legged on the tiger skin on the dais.A stick of incense burnt in the brazier before it and scented the air with its faint fragrance.He was alone as he had been on the first day I saw him.He looked at me with an intensity so piercing that I had the impression he saw into the deepest recesses of my being.I know he knew what had happened.

“‘It is well，'he said.‘You have been gone long enough.'

“I went down on my knees and he gave me his blessing. When I rose to my feet my eyes were filled with tears.He was a man of noble and saintly character.I shall always look upon it as a privilege to have known him.I said good-bye to the devotees.Some had been there for years；some had come after me.I left my few belongings and my books, thinking they might be useful to someone, and with my knapsack on my back, in the same old slacks and brown coat I had arrived in, a battered topee on my head, I trudged back to the town.A week later I boarded a ship at Bombay and landed at Marseilles.”

Silence fell upon us as we pursued our separate reflections；but, tired though I was, there was one more point which I very much wanted to put to him, and it was I who finally spoke.

“Larry, old boy，”I said，“this long quest of yours started with the problem of evil. It was the problem of evil that urged you on.You've said nothing all this time to indicate that you've reached even a tentative solution of it.”

“It may be that there is no solution or it may be that I'm not clever enough to find it. Ramakrishna looked upon the world as the sport of God.‘It is like a game，'he said.‘In this game there are joy and sorrow, virtue and vice, knowledge and ignorance, good and evil.The game cannot continue if sin and suffering are altogether eliminated from the creation.'I would reject that with all my strength.The best I can suggest is that when the Absolute manifested itself in the world evil was the natural correlation of good.You could never have had the stupendous beauty of the Himalayas without the unimaginable horror of a convulsion of the earth's crust.The Chinese crafts-man who makes a vase in what they call eggshell porcelain can give it a lovely shape, ornament it with a beautiful design, stain it a ravishing colour, and give it a perfect glaze, but from its very nature he can't make it anything but fragile.If you drop it on the floor it will break into a dozen fragments.Isn’t it possible in the same way that the values we cherish in the world can only exist in combination with evil?”

“It's an ingenious notion, Larry. I don't think it's very satisfactory.”

“Neither do I，”he smiled.“The best to be said for it is that when you've come to the conclusion that something is inevitable all you can do is to make the best of it.”

“What are your plans now?”

“I've got a job of work to finish here and then I shall go back to America.”

“What to do?”

“Live.”

“How?”

He answered very coolly, but with an impish twinkle in his eyes, for he knew very well how little I expected such a reply.

“With calmness, forbearance, compassion, selflessness, and continence.”

“A tall order，”I said.“And why continence?you're a young man；is it wise to attempt to suppress what with hunger is the strongest instinct of the human animal?”

“I am in the fortunate position that sexual indulgence with me has been a pleasure rather than a need. I know by personal experience that in nothing are the wise men of India more dead right than in their contention that chastity intensely enhances the power of the spirit.”

“I should have thought that wisdom consisted in striking a balance between the claims of the body and the claims of the spirit.”

“That is just what the Indians maintain that we in the West haven't done. They think that we with our countless inventions, with our factories and machines and all they produce, have sought happiness in material things, but that happiness rests not in them, but in spiritual things.And they think the way we have chosen leads to destruction.”

“And are you under the impression that America is a suitable place to practise the particular virtues you mentioned?”

“I don't see why not. You Europeans know nothing about America.Because we amass large fortunes you think we care for nothing but money.We care nothing for it；the moment we have it we spend it, sometimes well, sometimes ill, but we spend it.Money is nothing to us；it's merely the symbol of success.We are the greatest idealists in the world；I happen to think that we've set our ideal on the wrong objects；I happen to think that the greatest ideal man can set before himself is self-perfection.”

“It's a noble one, Larry.”

“Isn't it worth while to try to live up to it?”

“But can you for a moment imagine that you, one man, can have any effect on such a restless, busy, lawless, intensely individualistic people as the people of America?You might as well try to hold back the waters of the Mississippi with your bare hands.”

“I can try. It was one man who invented the wheel.It was one man who discovered the law of gravitation.Nothing that happens is without effect.If you throw a stone in a pond the universe isn't quite the same as it was before.It's a mistake to think that those holy men of India lead useless lives.They are a shining light in the darkness.They represent an ideal that is a refreshment to their fellows；the common run may never attain it, but they respect it and it affects their lives for good.When a man becomes pure and perfect the influence of his character spreads so that they who seek truth are naturally drawn to him.It may be that if I lead the life I've planned for myself it may affect others；the effect may be no greater than the ripple caused by a stone thrown in a pond, but one ripple causes another, and that one a third；it's just possible that a few people will see that my way of life offers happiness and peace, and that they in their turn will teach what they have learnt to others.”

“I wonder if you have any idea what you're up against, Larry. You know, the Philistines have long since discarded the rack and stake as a means of suppressing the opinions they feared：they've discovered a much more deadly weapon of destruction-the wisecrack.”

“I'm a pretty tough guy，”smiled Larry.

“Well, all I can say is that it's damned lucky for you that you have a private income.”

“It's been of great use to me. Except for that I shouldn't have been able to do all I've done.But my apprenticeship is over.From now on it can only be a burden to me.I shall rid myself of it.”

“That would be very unwise. The only thing that may make the kind of life you propose possible is financial independence.”

“On the contrary, financial independence would make the life I propose meaningless.”

I couldn't restrain a gesture of impatience.

“It may be all very well for the wandering mendicant in India；he can sleep under a tree and the pious are willing enough to acquire merit by filling his begging-bowl with food. But the American climate is far from suitable for sleeping out in the open, and though I don't pretend to know much about America, I do know that if there's one thing your countrymen are agreed upon it is that if you want to eat you must work.My poor Larry, you'd be sent to the workhouse as a vagrant before ever you got into your stride.”

He laughed.

“I know. One must adapt oneself to one's environment and of course I'd work.When I get to America I shall try to get a job in a garage.I'm a pretty good mechanic and I don't think it ought to be difficult.”

“Wouldn't you then be wasting energy that might be more usefully employed in other ways?”

“I like manual labour. Whenever I've got waterlogged with study I've taken a spell of it and found it spiritually invigorating.I remember reading a biography of Spinoza and thinking how silly the author was to look upon it as a terrible hardship that in order to earn his scanty living Spinoza had to polish lenses.I'm sure it was a help to his intellectual activity, if only because it diverted his attention for a while from the hard work of speculation.My mind is free when I'm washing a car or tinkering with a carburettor and when the job's done I have the pleasant sensation of having accomplished something.Naturally I wouldn’t want to stay in a garage indefinitely.It’s many years since I was in America and I must learn it afresh.I shall try to get work as a truck driver.In that way I should be able to travel from end to end of the country.”

“You've forgotten perhaps the most important use of money. It saves time.Life is so short, and there's so much to do, one can't afford to waste a minute；and just think how much you waste, for instance, in walking from place to place instead of going by bus and in going by bus instead of by taxi.”

Larry smiled.

“True enough and I hadn't thought of it, but I could cope with that difficulty by having my own taxi.”

“What d'you mean by that?”

“Eventually I shall settle in New York, among other reasons because of its libraries；I can live on very little, I don't mind where I sleep and I'm quite satisfied with one meal a day；by the time I've seen all I want to of America I should be able to have saved enough to buy a taxi and become a taxi driver.”

“You ought to shut up, Larry. You're as crazy as a loon.”

“Not at all. I'm very sensible and practical.As an owner-driver I would need to work only for as many hours as would provide for my board and lodging and for the depreciation on the car.The rest of my time I could devote to other work and if I wanted to go anywhere in a hurry I could always go in my taxi.”

“But, Larry, a taxi is just as much of a possession as a government bond，”I said, to tease him.“As an owner-driver you'd be a capitalist.”

He laughed.

“No. My taxi would be merely the instrument of my labour.It would be an equivalent to the staff and the begging-bowl of the wandering mendicant.”

On this note of banter our conversation ended. I had noticed for some time that people were coming into the café with greater frequency.One man in evening dress sat down not far from us and ordered himself a substantial breakfast.He had the tired but satisfied mien of one who looks back with complacency upon a night of amorous dalliance.A few old gentlemen, early risers because old age needs little sleep, were drinking their café au lait with deliberation while through thick-lensed spectacles they read the morning paper.Younger men, some of them neat and spruce, others in threadbare coats, hurried in to devour a roll and swallow a cup of coffee on their way to a shop or an office.An old crone entered with a pile of newspapers and went round offering them for sale, vainly as far as I could see, at the various tables.I looked out of the great plate glass windows and saw that it was broad daylight.A minute or two later the electric light was turned off except at the rear of the huge restaurant.I looked at my watch.It was past seveno’clock.

“What about a spot of breakfast?”I said.

We had croissants, all crisp and hot from the baker's, and café au lait.I was tired and listless, and felt certain I looked like the wrath of God, but Larry seemed as fresh as ever.His eyes were shining, there wasn’t a line on his smooth face, and he didn’t look a day more than twenty-five.The coffee revived me.

“Will you allow me to give you a piece of advice, Larry?It's not a thing I give often.”

“It's not a thing I take often，”he answered with a grin.

“Will you think very carefully before you dispossess yourself of your very small fortune?When it's gone, it's gone for ever. A time may come when you'll want money very badly, either for yourself or for somebody else, and then you'll bitterly regret that you were such a fool.”

There was a glint of mockery in his eyes as he answered, but it was devoid of malice.

“You attach more importance to money than I do.”

“I can well believe it，”I answered tartly.“You see, you've always had it and I haven't. It's given me what I value almost more than anything else in life-independence.You can't think what a comfort it's been to me to think that if I wanted to I could tell anyone in the world to go to hell.”

“But I don't want to tell anyone in the world to go to hell, and if I did the lack of a bank balance wouldn't prevent me. You see, money to you means freedom；to me it means bondage.”

“You're an obstinate brute, Larry.”

“I know. I can't help it.But in any case I have plenty of time to change my mind if I want to.I'm not going back to America till next spring.My friend Auguste Cottet, the painter, has lent me a cottage at Sanary and I'm going to spend the winter there.”

Sanary is an unpretentious seaside resort on the Riviera, between Bandol and Toulon, and it is frequented by artists and writers who do not care for the garish mummery of St. Tropez.

“You'll like it if you don't mind it's being as dull as ditchwater.”

“I have work to do. I've collected a lot of material and I'm going to write a book.”

“What's it about?”

“You'll see when it comes out，”he smiled.

“If you'd like to send it to me when it's finished I think I can get it published for you.”

“You needn't bother about that. I have some American friends who run a small press in Paris and I've arranged with them to print it for me.”

“But you can't expect a book brought out like that to have any sale and you won't get any reviews.”

“I don't care if it's reviewed and I don't expect it to sell. I'm only printing enough copies to send to my friends in India and the few people I know in France who might be interested in it.It's of no particular importance.I’m only writing it to get all that material out of the way, and I’m publishing it because I think you can only tell what a thing’s like when you see it in print.”

“I see the point of both those reasons.”

We had finished our breakfast by now and I called the waiter for the bill. When it came I passed it over to Larry.

“If you're going to chuck your money down the drain you can damn well pay for my breakfast.”

He laughed and paid. I was stiff from sitting so long and as we walked out of the restaurant my sides ached.It was good to get into the fresh clean air of the autumn morning.The sky was blue, and the Avenue de Clichy, a sordid thoroughfare by night, had a mild jauntiness, like a painted, haggard woman walking with a girl's springy step, that was not displeasing.I signalled a passing taxi.

“Can I give you a lift?”I asked Larry.

“No. I shall walk down to the Seine and have a swim at one of the baths, then I must go to the Bibliothéque, I’vegot some research to do there.”

We shook hands and I watched him cross the road with his loose, long-legged stride. I, being made of stuff less stern, stepped into a taxi and returned to my hotel.When I got into my sitting-room I noticed that it was after eight.

“This is a nice hour for an elderly gentleman to get home，”I remarked disapprovingly to the nude lady（under a glass case）who had since the year 1813 been lying on top of the clock in what I should have thought was a position of extreme discomfort.

She continued to look at her gilt bronze face in a gilt bronze mirror, and all the clock said was：tick, tick. I turned on a hot bath.When I had lain in it till it was tepid, I dried myself, swallowed a sleeping-tablet, and taking to bed with me Valéry’s Le Cimetière Marin, which happened to be on the night table, read till I fell asleep.





CHAPTER SEVEN


1


One morning, six months later, in April, I was busy writing in my study on the roof of my house at Cap Ferrat when a servant came up to say that the police of St. Jean（my neighbouring village）were below and wished to see me.I was vexed at being interrupted and could not imagine what they wanted.My conscience was at ease and I had already given my subscription to the Benevolent Fund.In return I had received a card, which I kept in my car so that if I was stopped for exceeding the speed limit or found parked on the wrong side of a street I could unostentatiously let it be seen while producing my driving licence and so escape with an indulgent caution.I thought it more likely then that one of my servants had been the victim of an anonymous denunciation, that being one of the amenities of French life, because her papers were not in order；but being on good terms with the local cops, whom I never allowed to leave my house without a glass of wine to speed them on their way, I anticipated no great difficulty.But they, for they worked in pairs, had come on a very different errand.

After we had shaken hands and inquired after our respective healths, the senior of the two-he was called a brigadier and had one of the most imposing moustaches I ever saw-fished a notebook out of his pocket. He turned over the pages with a dirty thumb.

“Does the name Sophie Macdonald say something to you?”he asked.

“I know a person of that name，”I replied cautiously.

“We have just been in telephonic communication with the police station at Toulon and the chief inspector requests you to betake yourself there（vous prie de vous y rendre）without delay.”

“For what reason?”I asked.“I am only slightly acquainted with Mrs. Macdonald.”

I jumped to the conclusion that she had got into trouble, probably connected with opium, but I didn't see why I should be mixed up in it.

“That is not my affair. There is no doubt that you have had dealings with this woman.It appears that she has been missing from her lodgings for five days and a body has been fished out of the harbour which the police have reason to believe is hers.They want you to identify it.”

A cold shiver passed through me. I was not, however, too much surprised.It was likely enough that the life she led would incline her in a moment of depression to put an end to herself.

“But surely she can be identified by her clothes and her papers.”

“She was found stark naked with her throat cut.”

“Good God！”I was horrified. I reflected for an instant.For all I knew the police could force me to go and I thought I had better submit with good grace.“Very well.I will take the first train I can.”

I looked up a timetable and found that I could catch one that would get me to Toulon between five and six. The brigadier said he would phone the chief inspector to that effect and asked me on my arrival to go straight to the police station.I did no more work that morning.I packed a few necessary things in a suitcase and after luncheon drove to the station.





2


On presenting myself at the headquarters of the Toulon police I was immediately ushered into the room of the chief inspector. He was sitting at a table, a heavy, swarthy man of saturnine appearance whom I took to be a Corsican.He threw me, perhaps from force of habit, a suspicious glance；but noticing the ribbon of the Legion of Honour, which I had taken the precaution to put in my buttonhole, with an unctuous smile asked me to sit down and proceeded to make profuse apologies for having been obliged to incommode a person of my distinction.Adopting a similar tone, I assured him that nothing could make me happier than to be of service to him.Then we got down to brass tacks and he resumed his brusque, rather insolent manner.Looking at some papers before him, he said：

“This is a dirty business. It appears that the woman Macdonald had a very bad reputation.She was a drunkard, a dope fiend, and a nymphomaniac.She was in the habit of sleeping not only with sailors off the ships, but with the riffraff of the town.How does it happen that a person of your age and respectability should be acquainted with such a character?”

I was inclined to tell him that it was no business of his, but from a diligent perusal of hundreds of detective stories I have learnt that it is well to be civil with the police.

“I knew her very little. I met her when she was a girl in Chicago, where she afterwards married a man of good position.I met her again in Paris a year or so ago through friends of hers and mine.”

I had been wondering how on earth he had ever connected me with Sophie, but now he pushed forward a book.

“This volume was found in her room. If you will kindly look at the dedication you will see that it hardly suggests that your acquaintance with her was as slight as you claim.”

It was the translation of that novel of mine that she had seen in the bookshop window and asked me to write in. Under my own name I had written“Mignonne, allons voir si la rose，”because it was the first thing that occurred to me.It certainly looked a trifle familiar.

“If you are suggesting that I was her lover, you are mistaken.”

“It would be no affair of mine，”he replied, and then with a gleam in his eye：“And without wishing to say anything offensive to you I must add that from what I have heard of her proclivities I should not say you were her type. But it is evident that you would not address a perfect stranger as mignonne.”

“That line, monsieur le commissaire, is the first line of a celebrated poem by Ronsard, whose works I am certain are familiar to a man of your education and culture. I wrote it because I felt sure she knew the poem and would recall the following lines, which might suggest to her that the life she was leading was, to say the least of it, indiscreet.”

“Evidently I have read Ronsard at school, but with all the work I have to do I confess that the lines you refer to have escaped my memory.”

I repeated the first stanza and knowing very well he had never heard the poet's name till I mentioned it, had no fear that he would recall the last one which can hardly be taken as an incitement to virtue.

“She was apparently a woman of some education. We found a number of detective stories in her room and two or three volumes of poetry.There was a Baudelaire and a Rimbaud and an English volume by someone called Eliot.Is heknown?”

“Widely.”

“I have no time to read poetry. In any case I cannot read English.If he is a good poet it is a pity he doesn't write in French, so that educated people could read him.”

The thought of my chief inspector reading The Waste Land filled me with pleasure. Suddenly he pushed a snapshot towards me.

“Have you any idea who that is?”

I immediately recognized Larry. He was in bathing trunks, and the photograph, a recent one, had been taken, I guessed, during the summer part of which he had spent with Isabel and Gray at Dinard.My first impulse was to say I did not know, for I wanted nothing less than to get Larry mixed up in this hateful business, but I reflected that if the police discovered his identity my assertion would look as if I thought there was something to hide.

“He's an American citizen called Laurence Darrell.”

“It was the only photograph found among the woman's effects. What was the connexion between them?”

“They both came from the same village near Chicago. They were childhood friends.”

“But this photograph was taken not long ago, I suspect at a seaside resort in the North or on the West of France. It would be easy to discover the exact place.What is he, this individual?”

“An author，”I said boldly. The inspector slightly raised his bushy eyebrows and I guessed that he did not attribute high morality to members of my calling.“Of independent means，”I added to make it sound more respectable.

“Where is he now?”

Again I was tempted to say I didn't know, but again decided it would only make things awkward if I did. The French police may have many faults, but their system enables them to find anyone they want without delay.

“He's living at Sanary.”

The inspector looked up and it was clear that he was interested.

“Where?”

I had remembered Larry telling me that Auguste Cottet had lent him his cottage and on my return at Christmas I had written to ask him to come and stay with me for a while, but as I fully expected he had refused. I gave the inspector his address.

“I'll telephone to Sanary and have him brought here. It might be worth while to question him.”

I could not but see that the inspector thought that here might be a suspect, but I was only inclined to laugh；I was convinced that Larry could easily prove that he had nothing to do with the affair. I was anxious to hear more about Sophie's lamentable end, but the inspector only told me in somewhat greater detail what I already knew.Two fishermen had brought the body in.It was a romantic exaggeration of my local policeman's that it was stark naked.The murderer had left girdle and brassière.If Sophie had been dressed in the same way as I had seen her he had had to strip her only of her slacks and her jersey.There was nothing to identify her and the police had inserted a description in the local paper.This had brought a woman to the station who kept a small rooming-house in a back street, what the French call a maison de passe, to which men could bring women or boys.She was an agent of the police, who liked to know who frequented her house and what for.Sophie had been turned out of the hotel on the quay at which she was living when I ran across her because her conduct was more scandalous than even the tolerant proprietor could put up with.She had offered to engage a room with a tiny sitting-room beside it in the house of the woman I have just mentioned.It was more profitable to let it two or three times a night for short periods, but Sophie offered to pay so handsomely that the woman consented to rent it to her by the month.She came to the police station now to state that her tenant had been absent for several days, she had not bothered, thinking she had gone for a trip to Marseilles or to Villefranche, where ships of the British fleet had lately arrived, an event that always attracted women, young and old, from all along the coast；but she had read the description of the deceased in the paper and thought it might apply to her tenant.She had been taken to see the body and after a trifling hesitation declared it was that of Sophie Macdonald.

“But if the body's been identified, what do you want me for?”

“Madame Bellet is a woman of high honourability and excellent character，”said the inspector，“but she may have reasons for identifying the dead woman that we do not know；and in any case I think she should be seen by someone who was more closely connected with her so that the fact may be confirmed.”

“Do you think you have any chance of catching the murderer?”

The inspector shrugged his massive shoulders.

“Naturally we are making inquiries. We have questioned a number of persons at the bars she used to go to.She may have been killed out of jealousy by a sailor whose ship has already left the port, or by a gangster for whatever money she had on her.It appears that she always had on her a sum that would seem large to a man of that sort.It may be that some people have a strong suspicion who the culprit is, but in the circles she moved it is unlikely that anyone will speak unless it is to his advantage.Consorting with the bad characters she did, such an end as she has come to was only too probable.”

I had nothing to say to this. The inspector asked me to come next morning at nine o'clock, by which time he would have seen“this gentleman of the photograph”，after which a policeman would take us to the nearest morgue to see the body.

“And how about burying her?”

“If after identifying the body you claim it as friends of the deceased and are prepared to undertake the expense of the funeral yourselves, you will receive the necessary authorization.”

“I'm sure that Mr. Darrell and I would like to have it as soon as possible.”

“I quite understand. It is a sad story and it is better that the poor woman should be laid to rest without delay.And that reminds me that I have here the card of an undertaker who will arrange the matter for you on reasonable terms and with dispatch.I will just write a line on it so that he may give you every attention.”

I was pretty sure he would get a rake-off on the amount paid, but I thanked him warmly, and when he had ushered me out with every expression of esteem I went forthwith to the address on the card. The undertaker was brisk and businesslike.I chose a coffin, neither the cheapest nor the most expensive, accepted his offer to get me two or three wreaths from a florist of his acquaintance—“to save monsieur a painful duty and out of respect for the dead，”he said-and arranged for the hearse to be at the morgue at two o'clock next day.I could not but admire his efficiency when he told me that I need not trouble to see about a grave, he would do all that was necessary, and“Madame was a Protestant, I assume，”furthermore he would, if I wished it, have a pastor waiting at the cemetery to read the burial service.But since I was a stranger and a foreigner he was sure that I would not take it amiss if he asked me to be good enough to give him a cheque in advance.He named a larger sum than I had foreseen, evidently expecting me to beat him down, and I discerned a look of surprise, perhaps even of disappointment, on his face when I took out my cheque-book and wrote out a cheque without demur.

I took a room at an hotel and next morning returned to the police station. I was kept waiting for some time and then was bidden to go into the chief inspector's office.I found Larry, looking grave and distressed, sitting in the chair I had sat in the day before.The inspector greeted me with joviality.I might have been a long-lost brother.

“Well, mon cher monsieur, your friend has answered all the questions it was my duty to put him with the utmost frankness. I have no reason to disbelieve his statement that he had not seen this poor woman for eighteen months.He has accounted for his movements during the last week in a perfectly satisfactory manner as well as for the fact that his photograph was found in her room.It was taken at Dinard and he happened to have it in his pocket one day when he was lunching with her.I have had excellent reports of the young man from Sanary and I am besides, I say it without vanity, a good judge of character myself；I am convinced that he is incapable of committing a crime of this nature.I have ventured to offer him my sympathy that a friend of his childhood, brought up with all the advantages of a healthy family life, should have turned out so badly.But such is life.And now, my dear gentlemen, one of my men will accompany you to the morgue and when you have identified the body, your time is at your own disposal.Go and have agood lunch.I have a card here of the best restaurant in Toulon and I will just write a word on it which will assure you of the patron's best attention.A good bottle of wine will do you both good after this harrowing experience.”

He was by now positively beaming with good will. We walked to the mortuary with a policeman.They were not doing a lively business in that establishment.There was a body on one slab only.We went up to it and the mortuary attendant uncovered the head.It was not a pleasant sight.The sea water had taken the curl out of the dyed silvery hair and it was plastered dankly on the skull.The face was horribly swollen and it was ghastly to look at, but there was no doubt that it was Sophie's.The attendant drew the covering sheet down to show us what we both would rather not have seen, the horrid gash across the throat that stretched from ear to ear.

We went back to the station. The chief inspector was busy, but we said what we had to say to an assistant；he left us and presently returned with the necessary papers.We took them to the undertaker.

“Now let's have a drink，”I said.

Larry hadn't uttered a word since we left the police station to go to the mortuary except on our return there to declare that he identified the body as that of Sophie Macdonald. I led him down to the quay and we sat in the café in which I had sat with her.A strong mistral was blowing and the harbour, usually so smooth, was flecked with white foam.The fishing-boats were gently rocking.The sun shone brightly and, as always happens with a mistral, every object in sight had a peculiar sparkling sharpness as though you looked at it through glasses focused with more than common accuracy.It imparted a nerve-racking, throbbing vitality to everything in sight.I drank a brandy and soda, but Larry never touched the one I had ordered for him.He sat in moody silence and I did not disturb him.

Presently I looked at my watch.

“We'd better go and have something to eat，”I said.“We've got to be at the mortuary at two.”

“I'm hungry, I didn't have any breakfast.”

Having judged from his appearance that the chief inspector knew where the food was good, I took Larry to the restaurant he had told us of. Knowing that Larry seldom ate meat, I ordered an omelette and a grilled lobster and then, asking for the wine list, chose, again following the policeman's counsel, a vintage wine.When it appeared I poured out a glass for Larry.

“You damn well drink it，”I said.“It may suggest a topic of conversation to you.”

He obediently did as I bade him.

“Shri Ganesha used to say that silence also is conversation，”he murmured.

“That suggests a jolly social gathering of intellectual dons at the University of Cambridge.”

“I'm afraid you'll have to stand the racket of this funeral by yourself，”he said.“I haven't any money.”

“I'm quite prepared to do that，”I answered. Then the implication of his remark hit me.“You haven't been and gone and done it really?”

He did not answer for a moment. I noticed the whimsical, teasing glint in his eyes.

“You haven't got rid of your money?”

“Every cent except what I need to last me till my ship comes in.”

“What ship?”

“The man who has the next cottage to mine at Sanary is the Marseilles agent of a line of freighters that run from the Near East to New York. They've cabled him from Alexandria that they've had to put off a couple of sick men there from a ship that's coming on to Marseilles and asked him to get two more to take their place.He's a buddy of mine and he's promised to get me on.I’m giving him my old Citroën as a parting present.When I step on board I shall have nothing but the clothes I stand up in and a few things in a grip.”

“Well, it's your own money. You're free, white, and twenty-one.”

“Free is the right word. I've never been happier or felt more independent in my life.When I get to New York I shall have my wages and they'll carry me on till I can get a job.”

“What about your book?”

“Oh, it's finished and printed. I made a list of people I wanted it sent to-you ought to get a copy in a day or two.”

“Thank you.”

There was not much more to say and we finished our meal in amiable silence. I ordered coffee.Larry lit a pipe and I a cigar.I looked at him thoughtfully.He felt my eyes upon him and threw me a glance；his own were lit with an impish twinkle.

“If you feel like telling me I'm a damned fool, don't hesitate. I wouldn't in the least mind.”

“No, I don't particularly feel like that. I was only wondering if your life wouldn't have fallen into a more perfect pattern if you'd married and had children like everybody else.”

He smiled. I must have remarked twenty times on the beauty of his smile, it was so cosy, trustful, and sweet.It reflected the candour, the truthfulness of his charming nature；but I must do so once again, for now, besides all that, there was in it something rueful and tender.

“It's too late for that now. The only woman I've met whom I could have married was poor Sophie.”

I looked at him with amazement.

“Can you say that after all that's happened?”

“She had a lovely soul, fervid, aspiring, and generous. Her ideals were greathearted.There was even at the end a tragic nobility in the way she sought destruction.”

I was silent. I did not know what to make of these strange assertions.

“Why didn't you marry her then?”I asked.

“She was a child. To tell you the truth, it never occurred to me when I used to go over to her grandfather's and we read poetry together under the elm tree that there was in that skinny brat the seed of spiritual beauty.”

I could not but think it surprising that at this juncture he made no mention of Isabel. He could not have forgotten that he had been engaged to her and I could only suppose that he regarded the episode as a foolishness without consequence of two young things not old enough to know their own minds.I was ready to believe that the suspicion had never so much as fugitively crossed his mind that ever since she had been eating her heart out for him.

It was time for us to go. We walked to the square where Larry had left his car, very shabby now, and drove to the mortuary.The undertaker was as good as his word.The businesslike efficiency with which everything was accomplished, under that garish sky, with the violent wind bending the cypresses of the cemetery, added a last note of horror to the proceedings.When it was all over the undertaker shook hands with us cordially.

“Well, gentlemen, I hope you are satisfied. It went very well.”

“Very well，”I said.

“Monsieur will not forget that I am always at his disposition if he has need of my services. Distance is no object.”

I thanked him. When we came to the gate of the cemetery Larry asked me if there was anything further I wanted him for.

“Nothing.”

“I'd like to get back to Sanary as soon as possible.”

“Drop me at my hotel, will you?”

We spoke never a word as we drove. When we arrived I got out.We shook hands and he went off.I paid my bill, got my bag, and took a taxi to the station.I too wanted to get away.

A few days later I started for England. My intention had been to go straight through, but after what had happened I particularly wanted to see Isabel, so I decided to stop in Paris for twenty-four hours.I wired to her to ask if I could come in late in the afternoon and stay to dinner；when I reached my hotel I found a note from her to say that she and Gray were dining out, but that she would be very glad to see me if I would come not before half past five as she had afitting.

It was chilly and raining off and on quite heavily, so that I presumed Gray would not have gone to Mortefontaine to play golf. This did not suit me very well, since I wanted to see Isabel alone, but when I arrived at the apartment the first thing she said was that Gray was at the Travellers playing bridge.

“I told him not to be too late if he wanted to see you, but we're not dining till nine, which means we needn't get there before nine-thirty, so we've got plenty of time for a good talk. I've got all sorts of things to tell you.”

They had sublet the apartment, and the sale of Elliott's collection was to take place in a fortnight. They wanted to attend it and were moving into the Ritz.Then they were sailing.Isabel was selling everything except the modern pictures that Elliott had had in his house at Antibes.Though she didn't care much for them she thought quite rightly that they would be a prestige item in their future home.

“It's a pity poor Uncle Elliott wasn't more advanced. Picasso, Matisse, and Rouault, you know.I suppose his pictures are good in their way, but I'm afraid they'll seem rather old-fashioned.”

“I wouldn't bother about that if I were you. Other painters will come along in a few years and Picasso and Matisse won't seem any more up to date than your Impressionists.”

Gray was in process of concluding his negotiations and with the capital provided by Isabel was to enter a flourishing business as vice-president. It was connected with oil and they were to live at Dallas.

“The first thing we shall have to do is to find a suitable house. I want a nice garden so that Gray can have somewhere to potter about when he comes home from work and I must have a really large living-room so that I can entertain.”

“I wonder yon don't take Elliott's furniture over with you.”

“I don't think it would be very suitable. I shall make it all modern, with perhaps just a little touch of Mexican here and there to give it a note.As soon as I get to New York I'll find out who is the decorator everyone's going to now.”

Antoine, the manservant, brought in a tray with an array of bottles, and Isabel, always tactful, knowing that nine men out of ten are convinced they can mix a better cocktail than any woman（and they're right），asked me to shake a couple. I poured out the gin and the Noilly-Prat and added the dash of absinthe that transforms a dry Martini from a nondescript drink to one for which the gods of Olympus would undoubtedly have abandoned their home-brewed nectar, a beverage that I have always thought must have been rather like Coca-Cola.I noticed a book on the table as I handed Isabel her glass.

“Hello！”I said.“Here's Larry's book.”

“Yes, it came this morning, but I've been so busy, I had a thousand things to do before lunch and I was lunching out and I was at Molyneux's this afternoon. I don't know when I shall have a moment to get down to it.”

I thought with melancholy how an author spends months writing a book, and may be puts his heart's blood into it, and then it lies about unread till the reader has nothing else in the world to do. It was a volume of three hundred pages nicely printed and neatly bound.

“I suppose you know Larry has been in Sanary all the winter. Did you see him by any chance?”

“Yes, we were at Toulon together only the other day.”

“Were you?What were you doing there?”

“Burying Sophie.”

“She's not dead?”cried Isabel.

“If she hadn't been we'd have had no plausible reason to bury her.”

“That's not funny.”She paused for a second.“I'm not going to pretend I'm sorry. A combination of drink and dope, I suppose.”

“No, she had her throat cut and was thrown into the sea stark naked.”

Like the brigadier at St. Jean I found myself impelled a trifle to exaggerate her undress.

“How horrible！Poor thing. Of course leading the life she did she was bound to come to a bad end.”

“That's what the commissaire de police at Toulon said.”

“Do they know who did it?”

“No, but I do. I think you killed her.”

She gave me a stare of amazement.

“What are you talking about?”Then with the ghost of a chuckle：“Guess again；I have a cast-iron alibi.”

“I ran across her at Toulon last summer. I had a long talk with her.”

“Was she sober?”

“Sufficiently. She told me how it happened that she'd disappeared so unaccountably just a few days before she was going to be married to Larry.”

I noticed Isabel's face stiffen. I proceeded to tell her exactly what Sophie had told me.She listened warily.

“I've thought of her story a good deal since then and the more I've thought about it the more convinced I am that there's something fishy about it. I've lunched here twenty times and you never have liqueurs for luncheon.You'd been lunching alone.Why should there have been a bottle of zubrovka on the tray with the coffee-cup?”

“Uncle Elliott had just sent it to me. I wanted to see if I liked it as much as when I'd had it at the Ritz.”

“Yes, I remember how you raved about it then. I was surprised, as you never drink liqueurs anyway；you're much too careful of your figure for that.I had at the time an impression that you were trying to tantalize Sophie.I thought it was just malice.”

“Thank you.”

“On the whole you're very good at keeping appointments. Why should you have gone out when you were expecting Sophie for something so important to her and interesting to you as a fitting of her wedding dress?”

“She told you that herself. I wasn't happy about Joan's teeth.Our dentist is very busy and I just had to take the time he could give me.”

“When one goes to a dentist one makes the next appointment before leaving.”

“I know. But he called me up in the morning and said he had to break it, but could give me three o'clock that afternoon instead, so of course I jumped at it.”

“Couldn't the governess have taken Joan?”

“She was scared, poor darling, I felt she'd be happier if I went with her.”

“And when you came back and found the bottle of zubrovka three parts empty and Sophie gone, weren't you rather surprised?”

“I thought she'd got tired of waiting and gone on to Molyneux's by herself. I couldn't make it out when I went there and they told me she hadn't been.”

“And the zubrovka?”

“Well, I did notice that a good deal had been drunk. I thought Antoine had drunk it and I very nearly spoke to him about it, but Uncle Elliott was paying for him and he was a friend of Joseph's, so I thought I'd better ignore it.He's a very good servant and if he takes a little nip now and then who am I to blame him?”

“What a liar you are, Isabel.”

“Don't you believe me?”

“Not for a moment.”

Isabel got up and walked over to the chimney-piece. There was a wood fire and it was pleasant on that dreary day.She stood with one elbow on the mantel-shelf in a graceful attitude which it was one of her most charming gifts to be able to assume without any appearance of intention.Like most French women of distinction she dressed in black in the daytime, which peculiarly suited her rich colouring, and on this occasion she wore a dress the expensive simplicity of which displayed her slender figure to advantage.She puffed at her cigarette for a minute.

“There's no reason why I shouldn't be perfectly frank with you. It was most unfortunate that I had to go out and of course Antoine should never have left the liqueur and the coffee-things in the room.They ought to have been takenaway when I went out.When I came back and saw the bottle was nearly empty of course I knew what had happened, and when Sophie disappeared I guessed she'd gone off on a bat.I didn't say anything about it because I thought it would only distress Larry, and he was worried enough as it was.”

“Are you sure the bottle wasn't left there on your explicit instructions?”

“Quite.”

“I don't believe you.”

“Don't then.”She flung the cigarette viciously into the fire. Her eyes were dark with anger.“All right, if you want the truth you can have it and to hell with you.I did it and I'd do it again.I told you I'd stick at nothing to prevent her from marrying Larry.You wouldn't do a thing, either you or Gray.You just shrugged your shoulders and said it was a terrible mistake.You didn't care a damn.I did.”

“If you'd left her alone she'd be alive now.”

“Married to Larry and he'd be utterly miserable. He thought he'd make a new woman of her.What fools men are！I knew that sooner or later she'd break down.It stuck out a mile.You saw yourself when we were all lunching together at the Ritz how jittery she was.I noticed you looking at her when she was drinking her coffee；her hand was shaking so, she was afraid to take the cup with one hand, she had to put both her hands to it to get it up to her mouth.I noticed her watching the wine when the waiter filled our glasses；she followed the bottle with those horrible washed-out eyes of hers like a snake following the fluttering of a new-fledged chick and I knew she'd give her soul for a drink.”

Isabel faced me now, her eyes flashing with passion, and her voice was harsh. She couldn't get the words out quickly enough.

“The idea came to me when Uncle Elliott made all that fuss about that damned Polish liqueur. I thought it beastly, but I pretended it was the most wonderful stuff I'd ever tasted.I was certain that if she got a chance she'd never have the strength to resist.That's why I took her to the dress show.That's why I offered to make her a present of her wedding dress.That day, when she was going to have the last fitting, I told Antoine I'd have the zubrovka after lunch and then I told him I was expecting a lady and to ask her to wait and offer her some coffee and to leave the liqueur in case she fancied a glass.I did take Joan to the dentist’s, but of course we hadn’t an appointment and he couldn’t see us, so I took her to a newsreel.I’d made up my mind that if I found Sophie hadn’t touched the stuff I’d make the best of things and try to be friends with her.That’s true, I swear it.But when I got home and saw the bottle I knew I’d been right.She’d gone and I’d have bet any money in the world she’d gone for good.”

Isabel was actually panting when she finished.

“That's more or less what I imagined had happened，”I said.“You see, I was right；you cut her throat as surely as if you'd drawn the knife across it with your own hands.”

“She was bad, bad, bad. I'm glad she's dead.”She threw herself into a chair.“Give me a cocktail, damn you.”

I went over and mixed another.

“You are a mean devil，”she said as she took it from me. Then she allowed herself to smile.Her smile was like a child's that knows it's been naughty, but thinks it can wheedle you by its ingenuous charm not to be cross.“You won't tell Larry, will you?”

“I wouldn't dream of it.”

“Cross your heart?Men are so untrustworthy.”

“I promise you I won't. But even if I wanted to, I shouldn't have an opportunity as I don't suppose I shall ever see him again in my life.”

She sat bolt upright.

“What do you mean?”

“At this moment, he's on a freighter, either as a deck hand or a stoker, on his way to New York.”

“You don't mean that?What a strange creature he is！He was up here a few weeks ago for something to do with his book that he had to look up at the public library, but he never said a word about going to America. I'm glad；that meanswe shall see him.”

“I doubt it. His America will be as remote from your America as the Gobi desert.”

Then I told her what he had done and what he intended to do. She listened to me open-mouthed.Consternation was written on her face.She interrupted me now and then with an interjection“He's crazy.He's crazy.”When I had finished she hung her head and I saw two tears trickle down her cheeks.

“Now I really have lost him.”

She turned away from me and wept, leaning her face against the back of the chair. Her lovely face was twisted with the grief she did not care to hide.There was nothing I could do.I didn't know what vain, conflicting hopes she had cherished that my tidings had finally shattered.I had a vague notion that to see him occasionally, at least to know that he was part of her world, had been a bond of union, however tenuous, that his action had finally severed so that she knew herself for ever bereft.I wondered what unavailing regret afflicted her.I thought it would do her good to cry.I picked up Larry's book and looked at the table of contents.My copy had not arrived when I left the Riviera and I could not now hope to get it for several days.It was not in the least the sort of thing I expected.It was a collection of essays of about the same length as those in Lytton Strachey's Eminent Victorians, upon a number of famous persons.The choice he had made puzzled me.There was one on Sulla, the Roman dictator who, having achieved absolute power, resigned it to return to private life；there was one on Akbar, the Mogul conqueror who won an empire；there was one on Rubens, there was one on Goethe, and there was one on the Lord Chesterfield of the Letters.It was obvious that each of the essays had needed a tremendous amount of reading and I was no longer surprised that it had taken Larry so long to produce this book, but I could not see why he had thought it worth while to give it so much time or why he had chosen those particular men to study.Then it occurred to me that every one of them in his own way had made a supreme success of life and I guessed that this was what had interested Larry.He was curious to see what in the end it amounted to.

I skimmed a page to see how he wrote. His style was scholarly, but lucid and easy.There was nothing in it of the pretentiousness or the pedantry that too often characterizes the writing of the amateur.One could tell that he had frequented the best authors as assiduously as Elliott Templeton frequented the nobility and gentry.I was interrupted by a sigh from Isabel.She sat up and finished with a grimace the cocktail which was now luke-warm.

“If I don't stop crying my eyes'll be terrible and we're going out to dinner tonight.”She took a mirror out of her bag and looked at herself anxiously.“Yes, half an hour with an ice bag over my eyes, that's what I want.”She powdered her face and reddened her lips. Then she looked at me reflectively.“Do you think any the worse of me for what I did?”

“Would you care?”

“Strange as it may seem to you, I would. I want you to think well of me.”

I grinned.

“My dear, I'm a very immoral person，”I answered.“When I'm really fond of anyone, though I deplore his wrongdoing it doesn't make me less fond of him. You're not a bad woman in your way and you have every grace and every charm.I don't enjoy your beauty any the less because I know how much it owes to the happy combination of perfect taste and ruthless determination.You only lack one thing to make you completely enchanting.”

She smiled and waited.

“Tenderness.”

The smile died on her lips and she gave me a glance that was totally lacking in amenity, but before she could collect herself to reply Gray lumbered into the room. In the three years he had been in Paris Gray had put on a good many pounds, his face had grown redder, and his hair was thinning rapidly, but he was in rude health and in high spirits.He was unaffectedly pleased to see me.Gray's conversation was composed of clichés.However shop-worn, he uttered them with an obvious conviction that he was the first person to think of them.He never went to bed, but hit the hay, where he slept the sleep of the just；if it rained, it rained to beat the band and to the very end Paris to him was Gay Paree.But he was so kindly, so unselfish, so upright, so reliable, so unassuming that it was impossible not to like him.I had areal affection for him.He was excited now over their approaching departure.

“Gosh, it'll be great to get into harness again，”he said.“I'm feeling my oats already.”

“Is it all settled then?”

“I haven't signed on the dotted line yet, but it's on ice. The fella I'm going in with was a room-mate of mine at college, and he's a good scout, and I'm dead sure he wouldn’t hand me a lemon.But as soon as we get to New York I’ll fly down to Texas to give the outfit the once-over, and you bet I’ll keep my eyes peeled for a nigger in the woodpile before I cough up any of Isabel’s dough.”

“Gray's a very good businessman, you know，”she said.

“I wasn't raised in a barn，”he smiled.

He went on to tell me at somewhat excessive length about the business he was entering, but I understood little of such matters and the only concrete fact I gathered was that he stood a good chance of making a lot of money. He grew so interested in what he was saying that presently he turned to Isabel and said：

“Look here, why shouldn't we cut this lousy party and us three go and have a slap-up dinner at the Tour d'Argent by ourselves?”

“Oh, darling, we can't do that. They're giving the party for us.”

“Anyhow, I couldn't come now，”I interrupted.“When I heard you were fixed up this evening I called up Suzanne Rouvier and arranged to take her out.”

“Who's Suzanne Rouvier?”asked Isabel.

“Oh, one of Larry's gals，”I said to tease her.

“I always suspected Larry had a little floozie tucked away somewhere，”said Gray, with a fat chuckle.

“Nonsense，”snapped Isabel.“I know all about Larry's sex life. There isn't any.”

“Well, let's have one more drink before we part，”said Gray.

We had it and then I said good-bye to them. They came into the hall with me and while I was putting on my coat Isabel slipped her arm through Gray's and, nestling up to him, looked into his eyes with an expression that imitated very well the tenderness I had accused her of lacking.

“Tell me, Gray-frankly-do you think I'm hard-boiled?”

“No, darling, far from it. Why, has anybody been saying you were?”

“No.”

She turned her head away so that he shouldn't see, and in a manner that Elliott would certainly have thought very unladylike put out her tongue at me.

“It's not the same thing，”I murmured as I stepped out of the door and closed it behind me.

When I passed through Paris again the Maturins had gone and other people lived in Elliott's apartment. I missed Isabel.She was good to look at and easy to talk to.She was quick on the uptake and bore no malice.I have never seen her since.I am a poor and dilatory correspondent and Isabel was no letter writer.If she could not communicate with you by telephone or telegram she did not communicate with you.I had a Christmas card from her that Christmas with a pretty picture on it of a house with a Colonial portico surrounded by live oaks, which I took to be the house of the plantation that they had been unable to sell when they wanted the money and which now they were probably willing to keep.The postmark showed that it had been posted at Dallas, so I concluded that the deal had gone through satisfactorily and they were settled there.

I have never been to Dallas, but I suppose that, like other American cities I know, it has a residential district within easy motoring distance of the business section and the country club where the affluent have fine houses in large gardens with a handsome view of hill or dale from the living-room windows. In such a district and in such a house, furnishedfrom cellar to attic in the latest mode by the most fashionable decorator in New York, Isabel certainly dwells.I can only hope that her Renoir, her flower piece by Manet, her landscape by Monet, and her Gauguin do not look too dated.The dining-room is doubtless of a convenient size for the women's luncheons which she gives at frequent intervals and at which the wine is good and the food superlative.Isabel learnt a great deal in Paris.She would not have settled on the house unless she had seen at a glance that the living-room would do very well for the sub-deb dances which it would be her pleasant duty to give as her daughters grew older.Joan and Priscilla must be now of a marriageable age.I am sure that they have been admirably brought up；they have been sent to the best schools and Isabel has taken care that they should acquire the accomplishments that must make them desirable in the eyes of eligible young men.Though I suppose Gray by now is still a little redder in the face, more jowly, balder, and a good deal heavier, I can't believe that Isabel has changed.She is still more beautiful than her daughters.The Maturins must be a great asset to the community and I have little doubt that they are as popular as they deserve to be.Isabel is entertaining, gracious, complaisant, and tactful；Gray, of course, is the quintessence of the Regular Guy.

I continued to see Suzanne Rouvier from time to time until an unexpected change in her condition caused her to leave Paris and she too went out of my life. One afternoon, roughly two years after the events that I have just related, having spent an hour pleasantly browsing over the books in the galleries of the Odéon and with nothing to do for a while, I thought I would call on Suzanne.I had not seen her for six months.She opened the door, a palette on her thumb and a paintbrush between her teeth, clad in a smock covered with paint.

“Ah, c'est vous, cher ami. Entrez, je vous en prie.”

I was a little surprised at this formal address, for generally we spoke to one another in the second person singular, but I stepped into the small room that served both as living-room and studio. There was a canvas on the easel.

“I'm so busy, I don't know which way to turn, but sit down and I will go on with my work. I haven't a moment to waste.You wouldn't believe it, but I'm giving a one-man show at Meyerheim’s, and I have to get thirty canvases ready.”

“At Meyerheim's?That's wonderful. How on earth have you managed that?”

For Meyerheim is not one of those fly-by-night dealers in the Rue de la Seine who have a small shop that is always on the verge of closing for lack of money to pay the rent. Meyerheim has a fine gallery on the moneyed side of the Seine and he has an international reputation.An artist whom he takes up is well on the way to fortune.

“Monsieur Achille brought him to see my work and he thinks I have a lot of talent.”

“À d’autres, ma vieille，”I replied, which I think can best be translated by：“Tell that to the marines, old girl.”

She threw me a glance and giggled.

“I'm going to be married.”

“To Meyerheim?”

“Don't be an idiot.”She put down her brushes and her palette.“I've been working all day and I deserve a rest. Let us have a little glass of porto and I'll tell you all about it.”

One of the less agreeable features of French life is that you are apt to be pressed to drink a glass of vinegary port at an unseasonable hour. You must resign yourself to it.Suzanne fetched a bottle and two glasses, filled them, and sat down with a sigh of relief.

“I've been standing for hours and my varicose veins are aching. Well, it's like this.Monsieur Achille's wife died at the beginning of this year.She was a good woman and a good Catholic, but he did not marry her from inclination, he married her because it was good business, and though he esteemed and respected her it would be an exaggeration to say that her death left him inconsolable.His son is suitably married and is doing well in the firm and now a marriage has been arranged between his daughter and a count.Belgian it is true, but authentic, with a very pretty château in theneighbourhood of Namur.Monsieur Achille thought his poor wife would not wish the happiness of two young people to be deferred on her account, so the marriage, notwithstanding that they are in mourning, is to take place as soon as the financial arrangements are completed.Evidently Monsieur Achille will be lonely in that large house at Lille, and needs a woman not only to minister to his comfort, but also to run the important establishment necessary to his position.To cut a long story short, he has asked me to take the place of his poor wife, for as he very reasonably said：‘I married for the first time to eliminate competition between two rival firms, and I do not regret it, but there is no reason why I should not marry the second time to please myself.’”

“I congratulate you，”said I.

“Evidently I shall miss my liberty. I have enjoyed it.But one has to think of the future.Between ourselves, I don't mind telling you that I shall never see forty again.Monsieur Achille is at a dangerous age；where should I be if he suddenly took it into his head to run after a girl of twenty?And then there is my daughter to think of.She is now sixteen and promises to be as beautiful as her father.I have given her a good education.But it is no good denying facts that stare you in the face；she has neither the talent to be an actress nor the temperament to be a whore like her poor mother：I ask you then, what has she to look forward to?A secretaryship or a job in the post office.Monsieur Achille has very generously agreed that she should live with us and has promised to give her a handsome dot so that she can make a good marriage.Believe me, my dear friend, people can say what they like, but marriage still remains the most satisfactory profession a woman can adopt.Obviously when my daughter's welfare was concerned I could not hesitate to accept a proposition even at the cost of certain satisfactions which in any case, as the years go by, I should find it more difficult to obtain；for I must tell you that when I am married I propose to be of a ferocious virtue（d'une vertu farouche），for my long experience has convinced me that the only basis of a happy marriage is complete fidelity on both sides.”

“A highly moral sentiment, my pretty，'I said.“And will Monsieur Achille continue to make his fortnightly visits to Paris on business?”

“Oh, la la, for whom do you take me, my little one?The first thing I said to Monsieur Achille when he asked for my hand was：‘Now listen, my dear, when you come to Paris for your board meetings it is understood that I come too. I am not going to trust you here by yourself.'‘You cannot imagine that I am capable of committing follies at my age，'he answered.‘Monsieur Achille，'I said to him，‘you are a man in the prime of life and no one knows better than I that you have a passionate temperament.You have a fine presence and a distinguished air.You have everything to please a woman；in short I think it better that you should not be exposed to temptation.'In the end he agreed to give up his place on the board to his son, who will come to Paris instead of his father.Monsieur Achille pretended to think me unreasonable, but he was in point of fact enormously flattered.”Suzanne gave a sigh of satisfaction.“Life would be even harder for us poor women than it is if it were not for the unbelievable vanity of men.”

“All that is very fine, but what has it got to do with your having a one-man show at Meyerheim's?”

“You are a little stupid today, my poor friend. Have I not told you for years that Monsieur Achille is a highly intelligent man?He has his position to think of and the people of Lille are censorious.Monsieur Achille wishes me to take the place in society which as the wife of a man of his importance it will be my right to occupy.You know what these provincials are, they love to poke their long noses in other people's affairs, and the first thing they will ask is：who is Suzanne Rouvier?Well, they will have their answer.She is the distinguished painter whose recent show at the Meyerheim Gallery had a remarkable and well-deserved success.‘Madame Suzanne Rouvier, the widow of an officer in the colonial infantry, has with the courage characteristic of our Frenchwomen for some years supported herself and a charming daughter deprived too soon of a father's care by means of her talent, and we are happy to know that the general public will soon have the opportunity to appreciate the delicacy of her touch and the soundness of her technique at the galleries of the ever perspicacious Monsieur Meyerheim.'”

“What gibberish is that?”I said, pricking up my ears.

“That, my dear, is the advance publicity that Monsieur Achille is putting out. It will appear in every paper inFrance of any consequence.He has been magnificent.Meyerheim's terms were onerous, but Monsieur Achille accepted them as if they were a bagatelle.There will be a champagne d'honneur at the private view and the Minister of Fine Arts, who is under an obligation to Monsieur Achille, will open the exhibition with an eloquent speech in which he will dwell upon my virtues as a woman and my talent as a painter and which he will end with the declaration that the state, whose duty and privilege it is to reward merit, has bought one of my pictures for the national collections.All Paris will be there and Meyerheim is looking after the critics himself.He has guaranteed that their notices will be not only favourable but lengthy.Poor devils, they earn so little, it is a charity to give them an opportunity of making something on the side.”

“You've deserved it all, my dear. You've always been a good sort.”

“Et ta soeur，”she replied, which is untranslatable.“But that's not all. Monsieur Achille has bought in my name a villa on the coast at St.Rafael, so I shall take my place in Lille society not only as a distinguished artist, but as a woman of property.In two or three years he is going to retire and we shall live on the Riviera like gentlefolks（comme des gens bien）.He can paddle in the sea and catch shrimps while I devote myself to my art.Now I will show you my pictures.”

Suzanne had been painting for several years and she had worked through the manner of her various lovers to arrive at a style of her own. She still could not draw, but she had acquired a pretty sense of colour.She showed me landscapes that she had painted while staying with her mother in the province of Anjou, bits of the gardens at Versailles and the forest at Fontainebleau, street scenes that had taken her fancy in the suburbs of Paris.Her painting was vaporous and unsubstantial, but it had a flowerlike grace and even a certain careless elegance.

There was one picture that took my fancy and because I thought she would be pleased I offered to buy it. I cannot remember whether it was called A Glade in the Forest or The White Scarf and subsequent examination has left me uncertain to this day.I asked the price, which was reasonable, and said I would take it.

“You're an angel，”she cried.“My first sale. Of course you can't have it till after the show, but I'll see that it gets into the papers that you've bought it.After all, a little publicity can do you no harm.I'm glad you’ve chosen that one, I think it’s one of my best.”She took a hand mirror and looked at the picture in it.“It has charm，”she said, screwing up her eyes.“No one can deny that.Those greens-how rich they are and yet how delicate！And that white note in the middle, that is a real find；it ties the picture together, it has distinction.There’s talent there, there can be no doubt of it, there’s real talent.”

I saw that she was already a long way on the road to being a professional painter.

“And now, my little one, we've gossiped long enough, I must get back to work.”

“And I must be going，”I said.

“À propos, is that poor Larry still among the Redskins?”

For that was the disrespectful way in which she was accustomed to refer to the inhabitants of God's Own Country.

“So far as I know.”

“It must be hard for someone like him who is so sweet and gentle. If one can believe the movies life is terrible over there with all those gangsters and cowboys and Mexicans.Not that those cowboys haven't physical attraction which says something to you.Oh, la la！But it appears that it is excessively dangerous to go out into the streets of New York without a revolver in your pocket.”

She came to the door to see me out and kissed me on both cheeks.

“We've had some good times together. Keep a good recollection of me.”





6


This is the end of my story. I have heard nothing of Larry, nor indeed did I expect to.Since he generally did what he proposed, I think it likely that on his return to America he got a job in a garage and then drove a truck till he had acquired the knowledge he wanted of the country from which he had for so many years absented himself.When he had done that he may very well have carried out his fantastic suggestion of becoming a taxi driver：true, it was only arandom idea thrown across a café table in jest, but I shouldn’t be altogether surprised if he had put it into effect；and I have never since taken a taxi in New York without glancing at the driver on the chance that I might meet Larry’s gravely smiling, deep-set eyes.I never have.War broke out.He would have been too old to fly, but he may be once more driving a truck, at home or abroad；or he may be working in a factory.I should like to think that in his leisure hours he is writing a book in which he is trying to set forth whatever life has taught him and the message he has to deliver to his fellow-men；but if he is, it may be long before it is finished.He has plenty of time, for the years have left no mark on him and to all intents and purposes he is still a young man.

He is without ambition and he has no desire for fame；to become anything of a public figure would be deeply distasteful to him；and so it may be that he is satisfied to lead his chosen life and be no more than just himself. He is too modest to set himself up as an example to others；but it may be he thinks that a few uncertain souls, drawn to him like moths to a candle, will be brought in time to share his own glowing belief that ultimate satisfaction can only be found in the life of the spirit, and that by himself following with selflessness and renunciation the path of perfection he will serve as well as if he wrote books or addressed multitudes.

But this is conjecture. I am of the earth, earthy；I can only admire the radiance of such a rare creature, I cannot step into his shoes and enter into his innermost heart as I sometimes think I can do with persons more nearly allied to the common run of men.Larry has been absorbed, as he wished, into that tumultuous conglomeration of humanity, distracted by so many conflicting interests, so lost in the world's confusion, so wishful of good, so cocksure on the outside, so diffident within, so kind, so hard, so trustful, and so cagey, so mean and so generous, which is the people of the United States.That is all I can tell of him：I know it is very unsatisfactory；I can't help it.But as I was finishing this book, uneasily conscious that I must leave my reader in the air and seeing no way to avoid it, I looked back with my mind's eye on my long narrative to see if there was any way in which I could devise a more satisfactory ending；and to my intense surprise it dawned upon me that without in the least intending to I had written nothing more or less than a success story.For all the persons with whom I have been concerned got what they wanted：Elliott social eminence；Isabel an assured position backed by a substantial fortune in an active and cultured community；Gray a steady and lucrative job, with an office to go to from nine till six every day；Suzanne Rouvier security；Sophie death；and Larry happiness.And however superciliously the highbrows carp, we the public in our heart of hearts all like a success story；so perhaps my ending is not so unsatisfactory after all.
