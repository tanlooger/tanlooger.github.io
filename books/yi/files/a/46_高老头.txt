高老头（重译本）


批评家称高老头为近代的李尔王。但在社会观点上，它比莎翁的名剧意义更广深。巴尔扎克的人物不只是一个人物，而是时代的典型；悲剧的因素也不限于个人的性情气质，而尤在乎淫靡腐化的社会环境。鲍赛昂夫人代表没落的贵族，以隐遁终场；拉斯蒂涅与伏脱冷代表新兴阶级的两种作风：一个像瘟疫般钻进社会，一个像炮弹般轰进社会。野心家求名求利的挣扎，与高老头绝望的父爱交错之下，使小说内容愈显得光怪陆离，动人心魄。本书初译于一九四四年，印过四版，销达九千余部。兹因译者不满译者风格，特全部修正重译。交由本社[1]出版。

重译本序


以效果而论，翻译应当像临画一样，所求的不在形似而在神似。以实际工作论，翻译比临画更难。临画与原画，素材相同（颜色、画布，或纸或绢），法则相同（色彩学、解剖学、透视学）。译本与原作，文字既不侔，规则又大异。各种文字各有特色，各有无可模仿的优点，各有无法补救的缺陷，同时又各有不能侵犯的戒律。像英、法，英、德那样接近的语言，尚且有许多难以互译的地方；中西文字的扞格远过于此，要求传神达意，铢两悉称，自非死抓字典，按照原文句法拼凑堆砌能济事。

各国的翻译文学，虽优劣不一，但从无法文式的英国译本，也没有英文式的法国译本[1]。假如破坏本国文字的结构与特性，就能传达异国文字的特性而获致原作的精神，那么翻译真是太容易了。不幸那种理论非但是刻舟求剑，而且是削足适履，两败俱伤[2]。两国文字词类的不同，句法构造的不同，文法与习惯的不同，修辞格律的不同，俗语的不同，即反映民族思想方式的不同，感觉深浅的不同，观点角度的不同，风俗传统信仰的不同，社会背景的不同，表现方法的不同。以甲国文字传达乙国文字所包含的那些特点，必须像伯乐相马，要“得其精而忘其粗，在其内而忘其外”。而即使是最优秀的译文，其韵味较之原文仍不免过或不及。翻译时只能尽量缩短这个距离，过则求其勿太过，不及则求其勿过于不及。

倘若认为译文标准不应当如是平易，则不妨假定理想的译文仿佛是原作者的中文写作。那么原文的意义与精神，译文的流畅与完整，都可以兼筹并顾，不至于再有以辞害意，或以意害辞的弊病了。

用这个尺度来衡量我的翻译，当然是眼高手低，还没有脱离学徒阶段。《高老头》初译（一九四四）对原作意义虽无大误[3]，但对话生硬死板，文气淤塞不畅，新文艺习气既刮除未尽，节奏韵味也没有照顾周到，更不必说作品的浑成了。这次以三阅月的工夫重译一遍，几经改削，仍未满意。艺术的境界无穷，个人的才能有限：心长力绌，唯有投笔兴叹而已。

[1]《哈姆雷德》第一幕第一场有句：Not a mouse stirring，法国标准英法对照本《莎翁全集》译为：Pas un chat。岂法国莎士比亚学者不识mouse一字而误鼠为猫乎？此为译本不能照字面死译的最显著的例子。

[2]六年前，友人某君受苏联友人之托，以中国诗人李、杜等小传译成俄文。译稿中颇多中文化的俄文，为苏友指摘。某君以保持中国情调为辩，苏友谓此等文句既非俄文，尚何原作情调可言？以上为某君当时面述，录之为“削足适履，两败俱伤”二语作佐证。

[3]误译的事，有时即译者本人亦觉得莫名其妙。例如近译《贝姨》，书印之后，忽发现原文的蓝衣服译作绿衣服，不但正文错了，译者附注也跟着错了。这种文字上的色盲，真使译者为之大惊失“色”。





伏盖公寓


一个夫家姓伏盖，娘家姓龚弗冷的老妇人，四十年来在巴黎开着一所兼包客饭的公寓，坐落在拉丁区与圣·玛梭城关之间的圣·日内维新街上。大家称为伏盖家的这所寄宿舍，男女老少，一律招留，从来没有为了风化问题受过飞短流长的攻击，可是三十年间也不曾有姑娘们寄宿；而且非要家庭给的生活费少得可怜，才能使一个青年男子住到这儿来。话虽如此，一八一九年上，正当这幕惨剧开场的时候，公寓里的确住着一个可怜的少女。虽然惨剧这个字眼被近来多愁善感、颂赞痛苦的文学用得那么滥，那么歪曲，以致无人相信；这儿可是不得不用。并非在真正的字义上说，这个故事有什么戏剧意味；但我这部书完成之后，京城内外也许有人会掉几滴眼泪。出了巴黎是不是还有人懂得这件作品，确是疑问。书中有许多考证与本地风光，只有住在蒙玛脱岗和蒙罗越高地之间的人能够领会。这个著名的盆地，墙上的石灰老是在剥落，阳沟内全是漆黑的泥浆；到处是真苦难，空欢喜，而且那么忙乱，不知要怎么重大的事故才能在那儿轰动一下。然而也有些东零西碎的痛苦，因为罪恶与德行混在一块而变得伟大庄严，使自私自利的人也要定一定神，生出一点同情心；可是他们的感触不过是一刹那的事，像匆匆忙忙吞下的一颗美果。文明好比一辆大车，和印度的神车一样，[1]碰到一颗比较不容易粉碎的心，略微耽搁了一下，马上把它压碎了，又浩浩荡荡地继续前进。你们读者大概也是如此。雪白的手捧了这本书，埋在软绵绵的安乐椅里，想道：也许这部小说能够让我消遣一下。读完了高老头隐秘的痛史以后，你依旧胃口很好地用晚餐，把你的无动于衷推给作者负责，说作者夸张，渲染过分。殊不知这惨剧既非杜撰，亦非小说。一切都是真情实事，[2]真实到每个人都能在自己身上或者心里发现剧中的要素。

公寓的屋子是伏盖太太的产业，坐落在圣·日内维新街下段，正当地面从一个斜坡向弩箭街低下去的地方。坡度陡峭，马匹很少上下，因此挤在华·特·葛拉斯军医院和先贤祠之间的那些小街道格外清静。两座大建筑罩下一片黄黄的色调，改变了周围的气息；穹隆阴沉严肃，使一切都暗淡无光。街面上石板干燥，阳沟内没有污泥，没有水，沿着墙根生满了草。一到这个地方，连最没心事的人也会像所有的过路人一样无端端地不快活。一辆车子的声音在此简直是件大事；屋子死沉沉的，墙垣全带几分牢狱气息。一个迷路的巴黎人[3]在这一带只看见些公寓或者私塾，苦难或者烦恼，垂死的老人或是想作乐而不得不用功的青年。巴黎城中没有一个区域更丑恶，更没有人知道的了。特别是圣·日内维新街，仿佛一个古铜框子，跟这个故事再合适没有。为求读者了解起见，尽量用上灰黑的色彩和沉闷的描写也不嫌过分，正如游客参观初期基督徒墓窟的时候，走下一级级的石梯，日光随着暗淡，向导的声音越来越空洞。这个比较的确是贴切的。谁又能说，枯萎的心灵和空无一物的骷髅，究竟哪一样看上去更可怕呢？

公寓侧面靠街，前面靠小花园，屋子跟圣·日内维新街成直角。屋子正面和小园之间有条中间微凹的小石子路，大约宽两公尺；前面有一条平行的沙子铺的小路，两旁有风吕草、夹竹桃和石榴树，种在蓝白二色的大陶盆内。小路靠街的一头有扇小门，上面钉一块招牌，写着：伏盖宿舍；下面还有一行：本店兼包客饭，男女宾客，一律欢迎。临街的栅门上装着一个声音刺耳的门铃。白天你在栅门上张望，可以看到小路那一头的墙上，画着一个模仿青色大理石的神龛，大概是本区画家的手笔。神龛内画着一个爱神像：浑身斑驳的釉彩，一般喜欢象征的鉴赏家可能认作爱情病的标记，那是在邻近的街坊上就可医治的。[4]神像座子上模糊的铭文，令人想起雕像的年代，伏尔泰在一七七七年上回到巴黎大受欢迎的年代。那两句铭文是：[5]





不论你是谁，她总是你的师傅，

现在是，曾经是，或者将来是。

天快黑的时候，栅门换上板门。小园的宽度正好等于屋子正面的长度。园子两旁，一边是临街的墙，一边是和邻居分界的墙。大片的常春藤把那座界墙统统遮盖了，在巴黎城中格外显得清幽，引人注目。各处墙上都钉着果树和葡萄藤，瘦小而灰土密布的果实成为伏盖太太年年发愁的对象，也是和房客谈天的资料。沿着侧面的两堵墙各有一条狭小的走道，走道尽处是一片菩提树荫。伏盖太太虽是龚弗冷出身，菩提树三字老是念别音的，房客们用文法来纠正她也没用。两条走道之间，一大块方地上种着朝鲜蓟，左右是修成圆锥形的果树，四周又围着些莴苣、旱芹、酸菜。菩提树荫下有一张绿漆圆桌，周围放几个凳子。逢着大暑天，一般有钱喝咖啡的主顾，在热得可以孵化鸡子的天气到这儿来品尝咖啡。

四层楼外加阁楼的屋子用的材料是粗沙石，粉的那种黄颜色差不多使巴黎所有的屋子不堪入目。每层楼上开着五扇窗子，全是小块的玻璃；细木条子的遮阳撑起来高高低低，参差不一。屋子侧面有两扇窗，楼下的两扇装有铁栅和铁丝网。正屋之后是一个二十尺宽的院子：猪啊，鸭啊，兔子啊，和和气气地混在一块儿；院子底上有所堆木柴的棚子。棚子和厨房的后窗之间挂一口凉橱，下面淌着洗碗池流出来的脏水。靠圣·日内维新街有扇小门，厨娘为了避免瘟疫不得不冲洗院子的时候，就把垃圾打这扇门里扫到街上。

房屋的分配本是预备开公寓的。底层第一间有两扇临街的窗子取光，通往园子的是一扇落地长窗。客厅侧面通到饭厅，饭厅和厨房中间是楼梯道，楼梯的踏级是用木板和彩色地砖拼成的。一眼望去，客室的景象再凄凉没有：几张沙发和椅子，上面包的马鬃布满是一条条忽而暗淡忽而发光的纹缕。正中放一张黑地白纹的云石面圆桌，桌上摆一套白瓷小酒杯，金线已经剥落一大半，这种酒杯现在还到处看得到。房内地板很坏，四周的护壁板只有半人高，其余的地方糊着上油的花纸，画着《忒勒马科》[6]主要的几幕，一些有名的人物都着着彩色。两扇有铁丝网的窗子之间的壁上，画着加里泼梭款待攸里斯的儿子的盛宴。[7]四十年来这幅画老是给年轻的房客当作说笑的引子，把他们为了穷而不得不将就的饭食取笑一番，表示自己的身份比处境高出许多。石砌的壁炉架上有两瓶藏在玻璃罩下的旧纸花，中间放一座恶俗的半蓝不蓝的云石摆钟。壁炉内部很干净，可见除了重大事故，难得生火。

这间屋子有股说不出的味道，应当叫作公寓味道。那是一种闭塞的、霉烂的、酸腐的气味，叫人发冷，吸在鼻子里潮腻腻的，直往衣服里钻；那是刚吃过饭的饭厅的气味，酒菜和碗盏的气味，救济院的气味。老老少少的房客特有的气味，跟他们伤风的气味合凑成的令人作呕的成分，倘能加以分析，也许这味道还能形容。话得说回来，这间客室虽然教你恶心，同隔壁的饭厅相比，你还觉得客室很体面，芬芳，好比女太太们的上房呢。

饭厅全部装着护壁，漆的颜色已经无从分辨，只有一块块油迹画出奇奇怪怪的形状。几口黏手的食器柜上摆着暗淡无光的破裂的水瓶，刻花的金属垫子，好几堆都奈窑的蓝边厚瓷盆。屋角有口小橱，分成许多标着号码的格子，存放寄膳客人满是污迹和酒痕的饭巾。在此有的是销毁不了的家具，没处安插而扔在这儿，跟那些文明的残骸留在痼疾救济院里一样。你可以看到一个晴雨表，下雨的时候有一个教士出现；还有些令人倒胃的版画，配着黑漆描金的框子；一口镶铜的贝壳座钟；一只绿色火炉；几盏灰尘跟油混在一块儿的挂灯；一张铺有漆布的长桌，油腻之厚，足够爱淘气的医院实习生用手指在上面刻画姓名；几张断腿折臂的椅子；几块可怜的小脚毯，草辫老在散率而始终没有分离；还有些破烂的脚炉，洞眼碎裂，铰链零落，木座子像炭一样的焦黑。这些家具的古旧，龟裂，腐烂，摇动，虫蛀，残缺，老弱无能，奄奄一息，倘使详细描写，势必长篇累牍，妨碍读者对本书的兴趣，恐非性急的人所能原谅。红色的地砖，因为擦洗或上色之故，画满了高高低低的沟槽。总之，这儿是一派毫无诗意的贫穷，那种锱铢必较的、浓缩的、百孔千疮的贫穷；即使还没有泥浆，却已有了污迹；即使还没有破洞，还不会褴褛，却快要崩溃腐朽，变成垃圾。

这间屋子最有光彩的时间是早上七点左右，伏盖太太的猫赶在主人之前，先行出现，它跳上食器柜，把好几罐盖着碟子的牛奶闻嗅一番，呼啊呼啊地做它的早课。不久寡妇出现了，网纱做的便帽下面，露出一圈歪歪斜斜的假头发，懒洋洋地趿着愁眉苦脸的软鞋。她的憔悴而多肉的脸，中央耸起一个鹦鹉嘴般的鼻子，滚圆的小手，像教堂的耗子[8]一般胖胖的身材，膨亨饱满而颠颠耸耸的乳房，一切都跟这寒酸气十足而暗里蹲着冒险家的饭厅调和。她闻着室内暖烘烘的臭味，一点不觉得难受。她的面貌像秋季初霜一样新鲜，眼睛四周布满皱纹，表情可以从舞女那样的满面笑容，一变而为债主那样的竖起眉毛，板起脸孔。总之她整个的人品足以说明公寓的内容，正如公寓可以暗示她的人品。监狱少不了牢头禁卒，你想象中决不能有此无彼。这个小妇人的没有血色的肥胖，便是这种生活的结果，好像传染病是医院气息的产物。罩裙底下露出毛线编成的衬裙，罩裙又是用旧衣衫改的，棉絮从开裂的布缝中钻出来；这些衣衫就是客室、饭厅和小园的缩影，同时也泄露了厨房的内容与房客的流品。她一出场，舞台面就完全了。五十岁左右的伏盖太太跟一切经过忧患的女人一样。无精打采的眼睛，假惺惺的神气像一个会假装恼怒，以便敲竹杠的媒婆，而且她也存心不择手段地讨便宜，倘若世界上还有什么乔治或毕希葛吕可以出卖，她是决计要出卖的。[9]房客们却说她骨子里是个好人，他们听见她同他们一样咳嗽、哼哼，便相信她真穷。伏盖先生当初是怎么样的人，她从无一字提及。他怎样丢了家私的呢？她回答说是遭了厄运。他对她不好，只留给她一双眼睛好落眼泪，这所屋子好过活，还有给了她不必同情别人灾祸的权利，因为她说，她什么苦难都受尽了。

一听见女主人急促的脚声，胖子厨娘西尔维赶紧打点房客们的中饭。一般寄饭客人通常只包每月三十法郎的一顿晚饭。

这个故事开始的时代，寄宿的房客共有七位。二层楼上是全屋最好的两套房间，伏盖太太住了小的一套，另外一套住着古的太太，她过世的丈夫在共和政府时代当过军需官。和她同住的是一个年纪轻轻的少女，维多莉·泰伊番小姐，把古的太太当作母亲一般。这两位女客的膳宿费每年一千八百法郎。三层楼上的两套房间，分别住着一个姓波阿莱的老人，和一个年纪四十上下、戴假头发、鬓角染黑的男子，自称为退休的商人，叫作伏脱冷先生。四层楼上有四个房间：老姑娘米旭诺小姐住了一间；从前做粗细面条和淀粉买卖，大家叫作高老头的，住了另外一间；其余两间预备租给候鸟[10]，像高老头和米旭诺小姐般只能付四十五法郎一月膳宿费的穷学生；可是伏盖太太除非没有办法，不大乐意招留这种人，因为他们面包吃得太多。

那时代，两个房间中的一个，住着一位从安古兰末乡下到巴黎来读法律的青年，欧也纳·特·拉斯蒂涅。人口众多的老家，省吃俭用，熬出他每年一千二百法郎的生活费。他是那种因家境清寒而不得不用功的青年，从小就懂得父母的期望，自己在那里打点美妙的前程，考虑学业的影响，把学科迎合社会未来的动向，以便捷足先登，榨取社会。没有问题，这点真实性完全要归功于他敏锐的头脑，归功于他有……倘没有他的有趣的观察，没有他在巴黎交际场中无孔不入的本领，我们这故事就要缺乏真实的色彩；没有问题，这点真实性完全要归功于他敏锐的头脑，归功于他有种欲望，想刺探一桩惨事的秘密；而这惨事是制造的人和身受的人一致讳莫如深的。

四层楼的顶上有一间晾衣服的阁楼，还有做粗活的男仆克利斯朵夫和胖子厨娘西尔维的两间卧房。

除了七个寄宿的房客，伏盖太太旺季淡季统扯总有八个法科或医科的大学生，和两三个住在近段的熟客，包一顿晚饭。可以容纳一二十人的饭厅，晚餐时坐到十八个人；中饭只有七个房客，团团一桌的情景颇有家庭风味。每个房客趿着软鞋下楼，对包饭客人的衣着神气，隔夜的事故，毫无顾忌地议论一番。这七位房客好比伏盖太太特别宠爱的孩子，她按照膳宿费的数目，对各人定下照顾和尊敬的分寸，像天文家一般不差毫厘。这批萍水相逢的人心里都有同样的打算。三层楼的两位房客只付七十二法郎一月。这等便宜的价钱（唯有古的太太的房饭钱是例外），只能在圣·玛梭城关，在产科医院和流民习艺所中间的那个地段找到。这一点，证明那些房客明里暗里全受着贫穷的压迫，因此这座屋子内部的悲惨景象，在住户们破烂的衣着上照样暴露。男人们穿着说不出颜色的大褂，像高等住宅区扔在街头巷尾的靴子，快要磨破的衬衫，有名无实的衣服。女人们穿着黯淡陈旧，染过而又褪色的服装；戴着补过的旧花边，用得发亮的手套，老是暗黄色的领围，经纬散率的围巾。衣服虽是这样，人却差不多个个生得很结实，抵抗过人世的风波；冷冷的狠巴巴的脸，好像用旧而不再流通的银币一般模糊；干瘪的嘴巴配着一副尖利的牙齿。你看到他们会体会到那些已经演过的和正在搬演的戏剧——并非在脚灯和布景前面上演的，而是一些活生生的，或是无声无息的，冰冷的，把人的心搅得发热的，连续不断的戏剧。

老姑娘米旭诺，疲倦的眼睛上面戴着一个油腻的绿绸眼罩，扣在脑袋上的铜丝连怜悯之神也要为之大吃一惊。身体只剩一把骨头，穗子零零落落像眼泪一般的披肩，仿佛披在一副枯骨上面。当初她一定也俊俏过来，现在怎么会形销骨立的呢？为了荒唐胡闹吗？有什么伤心事吗？过分的贪心吗？是不是谈爱情谈得太多了？有没有做过花粉生意？还是单单是个娼妓？她是否因为年轻的时候骄奢过度，而受到老年时路人侧目的报应？惨白的眼睛教人发冷，干瘪的脸孔带点儿凶相。尖厉的声音好似丛林中冬天将临时的蝉鸣。她自称服侍过一个患膀胱炎的老人，被儿女们当作没有钱而丢在一边。老人给她一千法郎的终身年金，至今他的承继人常常为此跟她争执，说她坏话。虽然她的面貌被情欲摧残得很厉害，肌肤之间却还有些白皙与细腻的遗迹，足见她身上还保存一点儿残余的美。

波阿莱先生差不多是架机器。他走在植物园的小道上像一个灰色的影子：戴着软绵绵的旧鸭舌帽，有气无力地抓着一根手杖，象牙球柄已经发黄了；褪色的大褂遮不了空荡荡的扎脚裤，只见衣襟在那里扯来扯去；套着蓝袜子，两条腿摇摇晃晃像喝醉了酒；上身露出腌臜的白背心，枯草似的粗纱颈围，跟绕在火鸡式脖子上别扭的领带，乱糟糟地搅在一起。看他那副模样，大家都心里思忖，这个幽灵是否跟在意大利大街上溜达的哥儿们同样属于泼辣放肆的白种民族？什么工作使他这样干瘪缩小的？什么情欲把他生满小球刺儿的脸变成了黑沉沉的猪肝色？这张脸画成漫画，简直不像是真的。他当过什么差事呢？说不定做过司法部的职员，经手过刽子手们送来的账单——执行逆伦犯所用的蒙面黑纱，刑台下铺的糠，[11]刑架上挂铡刀的绳子等等的账单。也许他当过屠宰场收款员，或卫生处副稽查之类。总之，这家伙好比社会大磨坊里的一匹驴子，做了傀儡而始终不知道牵线的是谁，也仿佛多少公众的灾殃或丑事的轴心；总括一句，他是我们见了要说一声究竟这等人也少不得的人。这些被精神的或肉体的痛苦磨得色如死灰的脸相，巴黎的漂亮人物是不知道的。巴黎真是一片海洋，丢下探海锤也没法测量这海洋的深度。不论花多少心血到里面去搜寻去描写，不管海洋的探险家如何众多如何热心，都会随时找到一片处女地，一个新的洞穴，或是几朵鲜花，几颗明珠，一些妖魔鬼怪，一些闻所未闻、文学家想不到去探访的事。伏盖公寓便是这些奇怪的魔窟之一。

其中有两张脸跟多数房客和包饭的主顾成为显著的对比。维多莉·泰伊番小姐虽则皮色苍白，带点儿病态，像害干血痨的姑娘；虽则经常的忧郁，局促的态度，寒酸和娇弱的外貌，使她脱不了这幅画面的基本色调——痛苦；可是她的脸究竟不是老年人的脸，动作和声音究竟是轻灵活泼的。这个不幸的青年人仿佛一株新近移植的灌木，因为水土不宜而叶子萎黄了。黄里带红的脸色，灰黄的头发，过分纤瘦的腰身，颇有近代诗人在中世纪小雕像上发现的那种妩媚。灰中带黑的眼睛表现她有基督徒式的温柔与隐忍。朴素而经济的装束勾勒出年轻人的身材。她的好看是由于五官四肢配搭得巧。只要心情快乐，她可能非常动人；女人要有幸福才有诗意，正如穿扮齐整才显得漂亮。要是舞会的欢情把这张苍白的脸染上一些粉红的色调，要是讲究的生活使这对已经微微低陷的面颊重新丰满而泛起红晕，要是爱情使这双忧郁的眼睛恢复光彩，维多莉大可跟最美的姑娘们见个高低。她只缺少教女人返老还童的东西：衣衫和情书。她的故事足够写一本书。她的父亲自以为有不认亲生女儿的理由，不让她留在身边，只给六百法郎一年，又改变他财产的性质，以便全部传给儿子。维多莉的母亲在悲苦绝望之中死在远亲古的太太家里；古的太太便把孤儿当作亲女一样抚养长大。共和政府军需官的寡妇不幸除了丈夫的预赠年金和公家的抚恤金以外一无所有，可能一朝丢下这个既无经验又无资财的少女，任凭社会摆布。好心的太太每星期带维多莉去望弥撒，每半个月去忏悔一次，让她将来至少能做一个虔诚的姑娘。这办法的确不错。有了宗教的热情，这个弃女将来也能有一条出路。她爱她的父亲，每年回家去转达母亲临终时对父亲的宽恕；每年父亲总是闭门不纳。能居间斡旋的只有她的哥哥，而哥哥四年之中没有来探望过她一次，也没有帮助过她什么。她求上帝使父亲开眼，使哥哥软心，毫无怨恨地为他们祈福。古的太太和伏盖太太只恨字典上咒骂的字眼太少，不够形容这种野蛮的行为。她们咒骂混账的百万富翁的时候，总听到维多莉说些柔和的话，好似受伤的野鸽，痛苦的叫喊仍然吐露着爱。

欧也纳·特·拉斯蒂涅纯粹是南方型的脸：白皮肤，黑头发，蓝眼睛。风度，举动，姿势，都显出他是大家子弟，幼年的教育只许他有高雅的习惯。虽然衣着朴素，平日尽穿隔年的旧衣服，有时也能装扮得风度翩翩地上街。平常他只穿一件旧大褂，粗背心；蹩脚的旧黑领带扣得马马虎虎，像一般大学生一样；裤子也跟上装差不多，靴子已经换过底皮。

在两个青年和其余的房客之间，那四十上下、鬓角染色的伏脱冷，正好是个中间人物。人家看到他那种人都会喊一声好家伙！肩头很宽，胸部很发达，肌肉暴突，方方的手非常厚实，手指中节生着一簇簇茶红色的浓毛。没有到年纪就打皱的脸似乎是性格冷酷的标记；但是看他软和亲热的态度，又不像冷酷的人。他的低中音嗓子，跟他嘻嘻哈哈的快活脾气刚刚配合，绝对不讨厌。他很殷勤，老堆着笑脸。什么锁钥坏了，他立刻拆下来，粗枝大叶地修理，上油，锉一阵磨一阵，装配起来，说：“这一套我是懂的。”而且他什么都懂：帆船，海洋，法国，外国，买卖，人物，时事，法律，旅馆，监狱。要是有人过于抱怨诉苦，他立刻凑上来帮忙。好几次他借钱给伏盖太太和某些房客；但受惠的人死也不敢赖他的债，因为他尽管外表随和，自有一道深沉而坚决的目光教人害怕。看那唾口水的功架，就可知道他头脑冷静的程度：要解决什么尴尬局面的话，一定是杀人不眨眼的。像严厉的法官一样，他的眼睛似乎能看透所有的问题，所有的心地，所有的感情。他的日常生活是中饭后出门，回来用晚饭，整个黄昏都在外边，到半夜前后回来，用伏盖太太给他的百宝钥匙开大门。百宝钥匙这种优待只有他一个人享受。他待寡妇也再好没有，叫她妈妈，搂着她的腰，可惜这种奉承对方体会得不够。老妈妈还以为这是轻而易举的事，殊不知唯有伏脱冷一个人才有那么长的胳膊，够得着她粗大的腰身。他另外一个特点是饭后喝一杯葛洛丽亚[12]，每个月很阔绰地花十五法郎。那般青年人固然卷在巴黎生活的旋涡内一无所见，那般老年人也固然对一切与己无干的事漠不关心，但即使不像他们那么肤浅的人，也不会注意到伏脱冷形迹可疑。旁人的事，他都能知道或者猜到；他的心思或营生，却没有一个人看得透。虽然他把亲热的态度，快活的性情，当作墙壁一般挡在他跟旁人之间，但他不时流露的性格颇有些可怕的深度。往往他发一阵可以跟于凡那[13]相比的牢骚，专爱挖苦法律，鞭挞上流社会，攻击它的矛盾，似乎他对社会抱着仇恨，心底里密不透风地藏着什么秘密事儿。

泰伊番小姐暗中偷觑的目光和私下的念头，离不了这个中年人跟那个大学生。一个是精力充沛，一个是长得俊美，她无意之间受到他们吸引。可是那两位好似一个也没有想到她，虽说天道无常，她可能一变而为陪嫁富裕的对象。并且，那些人也不愿意推敲旁人自称为的苦难是真是假。除了漠不关心之外，他们还因为彼此境况不同而提防人家。他们知道没有力量减轻旁人的痛苦，而且平时叹苦经叹得太多了，互相劝慰的话也早已说尽。像老夫妻一样的无话可谈，他们之间的关系只有机械的生活，等于没有上油的齿轮在那里互相推动。他们可以在路上遇到一个瞎子而头也不回地走过，也可以无动于衷地听人家讲一桩苦难，甚至把死亡看作一个悲惨局面的解决；饱经忧患的结果，大家对最惨痛的苦难都冷了心。这些伤心人中最幸福的还算伏盖太太，高高在上地管着这所私人救济院。唯有伏盖太太觉得那个小园是一座笑盈盈的树林；事实上，静寂和寒冷，干燥和潮湿，使园子像大草原一样广漠无垠。唯有为她，这所黄黄的，阴沉沉的，到处是账台的铜绿味的屋子，才充满愉快。这些牢房是属于她的。她喂养那批终身做苦役的囚犯，他们尊重她的威权。以她所定的价目，这些可怜虫在巴黎哪儿还能找到充足而卫生的饭食，以及即使不能安排得高雅舒适、至少可以收拾得干干净净的房间？哪怕她做出极不公道的事来，人家也只能忍受，不敢叫屈。

整个社会的分子在这样一个集团内当然应有尽有，不过是具体而微罢了。像学校或交际场中一样，饭桌上十八个客人中间有一个专受白眼的可怜虫，老给人家打哈哈的出气筒。欧也纳·特·拉斯蒂涅住到第二年开头，发觉在这个还得住上两年的环境中，最堪注目的便是那个出气筒——从前做面条生意的高里奥老头。要是画家来处理这个对象，一定会像史家一样把画面上的光线集中在他头上。半含仇恨的轻蔑，带着轻视的虐待，对苦难毫不留情的态度，为什么加之于一个最老的房客身上呢？难道他有什么可笑的或是古怪的地方，比恶习更不容易原谅吗？这些问题牵涉到社会上许多暴行。也许人的天性就喜欢教那些为了谦卑，为了懦弱，或者为了满不在乎而忍受一切的人，忍受一切。我们不是都喜欢把什么人或物做牺牲品，来证明我们的力量吗？最幼弱的生物，儿童，就会在大冷天按人家的门铃，或者提着脚尖在崭新的建筑物上涂写自己的名字。

六十九岁的高老头，在一八一三年上结束了买卖，住到伏盖太太这儿来。他先住古的太太的那套房间，每年付一千二百法郎膳宿费，那气派仿佛多五个路易少五个路易[14]都无所谓。伏盖太太预收了一笔补偿费，把那三间屋子整新了一番，添置一些起码家具，例如黄布窗帘，羊毛绒面的安乐椅，几张胶画，以及连乡村酒店都不要的糊壁纸。高老头那时还被尊称为高里奥先生，也许房东看他那种满不在乎的阔气，以为他是个不知市面的冤大头。高里奥搬来的时候箱笼充实，里外服装，被褥行头，都很讲究，表示这位告老的商人很会享福。十八件二号荷兰细布衬衫，教伏盖太太叹赏不止，面条商还在纱颈围上扣着两只大金刚钻别针，中间系一条小链子，愈加显出衬衣料子的细洁。他平时穿一套宝蓝衣服，每天换一件雪白的细格布背心，下面鼓起一个滚圆的大肚子在那儿翕动，把一条挂有各色坠子的粗金链子，震动得一蹦一跳。鼻烟匣也是金的，里面有一个装满头发的小圆匣子，仿佛他还有风流艳事呢。听到房东太太说他风流，他嘴边立刻浮起笑容，好似一个小财主听见旁人称赞他的爱物。他的柜子（他把这个名词跟穷人一样念别了音）装满许多家用的银器。伏盖寡妇殷勤地帮他整东西时，不由得眼睛发亮，什么勺子、羹匙、食品、油瓶、汤碗、盘子、镀金的早餐用具，以及美丑不一，有相当分量，他舍不得放手的东西。这些礼物使他回想起家庭生活中的大事。他抓起一个盘，跟一个盖上有两只小鸽亲嘴的小钵，对伏盖太太说：

“这是内人在我们结婚的第一周年送我的。好心的女人为此花掉了做姑娘时候的积蓄。噢，太太，要我动手翻土都可以，这些东西我决不放手。谢天谢地！这一辈子总可以天天早上用这个钵喝咖啡；我不用发愁，有现成饭吃的日子还长哩。”

末了，伏盖太太那双喜鹊眼还瞥见一叠公债票，约略加起来，高里奥这个好人每年有八千到一万法郎的进款。从那天起，龚弗冷家的姑奶奶，年纪四十八而只承认三十九的伏盖太太，打起主意来了。虽然高里奥的里眼角向外翻转，又是虚肿又是往下掉，他常常要用手去抹，她觉得这副相貌还体面，讨人喜欢。他的多肉而突出的腿肚子，跟他的方鼻子一样暗示他具备伏盖寡妇所重视的若干优点；而那张满月似的，又天真又痴呆的脸，也从旁证实。伏盖寡妇理想中的汉子应当精壮结实，能把全副精神花在感情方面。每天早晨，多艺学校[15]的理发匠来替高里奥把头发扑粉，梳成鸽翅式，在他的低额角上留出五个尖角，十分好看。虽然有点儿土气，他穿扮得十分整齐，倒起烟来老是一大堆，吸进鼻孔的神气表示他从来不愁烟壶里会缺少玛古巴[16]。所以高里奥搬进伏盖太太家的那一天，她晚上睡觉的时候便盘算怎样离开伏盖的坟墓，到高里奥身上去再生；她把这个念头放在欲火上烧烤，仿佛烤一只涂满油脂的竹鸡。再醮，把公寓出盘，跟这位布尔乔亚的精华结合，成为本区中一个显要的太太，替穷人募捐，星期日逛旭阿西、梭阿西、香蒂伊[17]；随心所欲地上戏院，坐包厢，无须再等房客在七月中弄几张作家的赠券送她；总而言之，她做着一般巴黎小市民的黄金梦。她有一个铜子一个铜子积起来的四万法郎，对谁也没有提过。当然，她觉得以财产而论，自己还是一个出色的对象。

“至于其他，我还怕比不上这家伙！”想到这儿她在床上翻了个身，仿佛有心表现一下美妙的身段，所以胖子西尔维每天早上看见褥子上有个陷下去的窝。

从这天起，约莫有三个月，伏盖寡妇利用高里奥先生的理发匠，在装扮上花了点心血，推说公寓里来往的客人都很体面，自己不能不修饰得和他们相称。她想出种种玩意儿要调整房客，声言从今以后只招待在各方面看来都是最体面的人。遇到生客上门，她便宣传说高里奥先生，巴黎最有名望最有地位的商界钜头，特别选中她的公寓。她分发传单，上面大书特书：伏盖宿舍，后面写着：“拉丁区最悠久最知名的包饭公寓。风景优美，可以远眺高勃冷盆地（那是要在四层楼上远眺的），园亭幽雅，菩提树夹道成荫。”另外还提到环境清静、空气新鲜的话。

这份传单替她招来了特·朗倍梅尼伯爵夫人，三十六岁，丈夫是一个死在战场上的将军；她以殉职军人的寡妇身份，等公家结算抚恤金。伏盖太太把饭菜弄得很精美，客厅里生火有六个月之久，传单上的诺言都严格履行，甚至花了她的血本。伯爵夫人称伏盖太太为亲爱的朋友，说预备把特·伏曼朗男爵夫人和上校毕各阿梭伯爵的寡妇，她的两个朋友，介绍到这儿来；她们住在玛莱区[18]一家比伏盖公寓贵得多的宿舍里，租期快要满了。一朝陆军部各司署把手续办完之后，这些太太都是很有钱的。

“可是，”她说，“衙门里的公事老不结束。”

两个寡妇晚饭之后一齐上楼，到伏盖太太房里谈天，喝着果子酒，嚼着房东留备自用的糖果。特·朗倍梅尼夫人大为赞成房东太太对高里奥的看法，认为确是高见，据说她一进门就猜到房东太太的心思；觉得高里奥是个十全十美的男人。

“啊！亲爱的太太，”伏盖寡妇对她说，“他一点毛病都没有，保养得挺好，还能给一个女人许多快乐哩。”

伯爵夫人对伏盖太太的装束很热心地贡献意见，认为还不能跟她的抱负配合。“你得武装起来。”她说。仔细计算一番之后，两个寡妇一同上王宫市场的木廊[19]，买了一顶饰有羽毛的帽子和一顶便帽。伯爵夫人又带她的朋友上小耶纳德铺子挑了一件衣衫和一条披肩。武装买齐，扎束定当之后，寡妇真像煨牛肉饭店的招牌[20]。她却觉得自己大为改观，添加了不少风韵，便很感激伯爵夫人，虽是生性吝啬，也硬要伯爵夫人接受一顶二十法郎的帽子；实际是打算托她去探探高里奥，替自己吹嘘一番。朗倍梅尼夫人很乐意当这个差事，跟老面条商做了一次密谈，想笼络他，把他勾引过来派自己的用场；可是种种的诱惑，对方即使不曾明白拒绝，至少是怕羞得厉害；他的伧俗把她气走了。

“我的宝贝，”她对她的朋友说，“你在这个家伙身上什么都挤不出来的！他那疑神疑鬼的态度简直可笑；这是个吝啬鬼、笨蛋、蠢货，只能讨人厌。”

高里奥先生和朗倍梅尼太太会面的经过，甚至使伯爵夫人从此不愿再同他住在一幢屋里。第二天她走了，把六个月的膳宿费都忘了，留下的破衣服只值五法郎。伏盖太太拼命寻访，总没法在巴黎打听到一些关于特·朗倍梅尼伯爵夫人的消息。她常常提起这件倒霉事儿，埋怨自己过于相信人家，其实她的疑心病比猫还要重；但她像许多人一样，老是提防亲近的人而遇到第一个陌生人就上当。这种古怪的，也是实在的现象，很容易在一个人的心里找到根源。也许有些人，在共同生活的人身上再也得不到什么；把自己心灵的空虚暴露之后，暗中觉得受着旁人严厉的批判；而那些得不到的恭维，他们又偏偏极感需要，或者自己素来没有的优点，竭力想显得具备；因此他们希望争取陌生人的敬重或感情，顾不得将来是否会落空。更有一等人，天生势利，对朋友或亲近的人绝对不行方便，因为那是他们的义务，没有报酬的；不比替陌生人效劳，可以让自尊心满足一下。所以在感情圈内同他们离得越近的人，他们越不爱；离得越远，他们越殷勤。伏盖太太显然兼有上面两种性格，骨子里都是鄙陋的，虚伪的，恶劣的。

“我要是在这儿，”伏脱冷说，“包你不会吃这个亏！我会揭破那个女骗子的面皮，教她当场出彩。那种嘴脸我是一望而知的。”

像所有心路不宽的人一样，伏盖太太从来不能站在事情之外推究它的原因。她喜欢把自己的错处推在别人头上。受了那次损失，她认为老实的面条商是罪魁祸首；并且据她自己说，从此死了心。当她承认一切的挑引和搔首弄姿都归无用之后，她马上猜到了原因，以为这个房客像她所说的另有所欢。事实证明她那个美丽动人的希望只是一场空梦，在这家伙身上是什么都挤不出来的，正如伯爵夫人那句一针见血的话，她倒像是个内行呢。伏盖太太此后敌视的程度，当然远过于先前友谊的程度。仇恨的原因并非为了她的爱情，而是为了希望的破灭。一个人向感情的高峰攀登，可能中途休息；从怨恨的险坡往下走，就难得留步了。然而高里奥先生是她的房客，寡妇不能不捺着受伤的自尊心不让爆发，把失望以后的长吁短叹藏起来，把报复的念头闷在肚里，好似修士受了院长的气。逢到小人要发泄感情，不问是好感是恶感，总是不断地玩小手段的。那寡妇凭着女人的狡狯，想出许多暗中捉弄的方法，折磨她的仇人。她先取消公寓里添加出来的几项小节目。

“用不着什么小黄瓜跟鱼了。都是上当的东西！”她恢复旧章的那天早晨，这样吩咐西尔维。

可是高里奥先生自奉菲薄，正如一般白手成家的人，早年不得已的俭省已经成为习惯。素羹，或是肉汤，加上一盘蔬菜，一向是，而且永远就该是，他最称心的晚餐。因此伏盖太太要折磨她的房客极不容易，他简直无所谓嗜好，也就没法跟他为难。遇到这样一个无懈可击的人，她觉得无可奈何，只能瞧不起他，把她对高里奥的敌意感染别的房客；而他们为了好玩，竟然帮着她出气。

第一年将尽，寡妇对他十分猜疑，甚至在心里思忖：这个富有七八千法郎进款的商人，银器和饰物的精美不下于富翁的外室，为什么住到这儿来，只付一笔在他财产比例上极小的膳宿费？这第一年的大半时期，高里奥先生每星期总有一两次在外面吃晚饭；随后，不知不觉改为一个月两次。高里奥大爷那些甜蜜的约会，对伏盖太太的利益配合得太好了；所以他在家用餐的习惯越来越正常，伏盖太太不能不生气。这种改变被认为一方面由于他的财产慢慢减少，同时也由于他故意跟房东为难。小人许多最可鄙的习惯中间，有一桩是以为别人跟他们一样小气。不幸，第二年年终，高里奥先生竟证实了关于他的谰言，要求搬上三楼，膳宿费减为九百法郎。他需要极度撙节，甚至整整一冬屋里没有生火。伏盖寡妇要他先付后住，高里奥答应了，从此她便管他叫高老头。

关于他降级的原因，大家议论纷纷，可是始终猜不透！像那假伯爵夫人所说的，高老头是一个城府很深的家伙。一般头脑空空如也，并且因为只会胡扯而随便乱说的人，自有一套逻辑，认为不提自己私事的人决没有什么好事。在他们眼中，那么体面的富商一变而为骗子，风流人物一变而为老浑蛋了。一忽儿，照那个时代搬入公寓的伏脱冷的说法，高老头是做交易所的，送完了自己的钱，还在那里靠公债做些小投机，这句话，在伏脱冷嘴里用的是有声有色的金融上的术语。一忽儿，他是个起码赌鬼，天天晚上去碰运气，赢他十来个法郎。一忽儿，他又是特务警察雇用的密探；但伏脱冷认为他还不够狡猾当这个差事。又有一说，高老头是个放印子钱的守财奴，再不然是一个追同号奖券的人[21]。总之，大家把他当作恶劣的嗜好、无耻、低能所能产生的最神秘的人物。不过无论他的行为或恶劣的嗜好如何要不得，人家对他的敌意还不至于把他撵出门外：他从没欠过房饭钱。况且他也有他的用处，每个人快乐的或恶劣的心绪，都可用打趣或咕噜的方式借他来发泄。最近似而被众人一致认可的意见，是伏盖太太的那种说法。这个保养得那么好，一点毛病都没有，还能给一个女人许多快乐的人，据她说，实在是个古怪的好色鬼。伏盖寡妇的这种坏话有下面的事实做根据。

那个晦气星伯爵夫人白吃白住了半年，溜掉以后几个月，伏盖太太一天早上起身之前，听见楼梯上有绸衣窸窣的声音，一个年轻的女人轻轻巧巧地溜进高里奥房里，打开房门的方式又像有暗号似的。胖子西尔维立即上来报告女主人，说有个漂亮得不像良家妇女的姑娘，装扮得神仙似的，穿着一双毫无灰土的薄底呢靴，像鳗鱼一样从街上一直溜进厨房，问高里奥先生的房间在哪儿。伏盖太太带着厨娘去凑在门上偷听，耳朵里掠到几句温柔的话；两人会面的时间也有好一会。高里奥送女客出门，胖子西尔维马上抓起菜篮，装作上菜市的模样去跟踪这对情人。

她回来对女主人说：“太太，高里奥先生一定钱多得作怪，才撑得起那样的场面。你真想不到吊刑街转角，有一辆漂亮马车等在那里，我看她上去的。”

吃晚饭的时候，伏盖太太去拉了一下窗帘，把射着高里奥眼睛的那道阳光遮掉。[22]

“高里奥先生，你阳光高照，艳福不浅呢，”她说话之间暗指他早晨的来客，“吓！你眼力真好，她漂亮得很啊。”

“那是我的女儿呐。”他回答时那种骄傲的神气，房客都以为是老人故意遮面子。

一个月以后，又有一个女客来拜访高里奥先生。他女儿第一次来是穿的晨装，这次是晚餐以后，穿得像要出去应酬的模样。房客在客厅里聊天，瞥见一个美丽的金发女子，瘦瘦的身腰，极有丰韵，那种高雅大方的气度绝不可能是高老头的女儿。

“哎啊！竟有两个！”胖子西尔维说；她完全认不出是同一个人。

过了几天，另外一个女儿，高大，结实，深色皮肤，黑头发，配着炯炯有神的眼睛，跑来见高里奥先生。

“哎啊！竟有三个！”西尔维说。

这第二个女儿初次也是早上来的，隔了几天又在黄昏时穿了跳舞衣衫，坐了车来。

“哎啊！竟有四个！”伏盖太太和西尔维一齐嚷着。她们在这位阔太太身上一点没有看出她上次早晨穿扮朴素的影子。

那时高里奥还付着一千二百法郎的膳宿费。伏盖太太觉得一个富翁养四五个情妇是挺平常的，把情妇充作女儿也很巧妙。他把她们叫到公寓里来，她也并不生气。可是那些女客既然说明了高里奥对她冷淡的原因，她在第二年年初便唤他做老雄猫。等到他降级到九百法郎之后，有一次她看见这些女客之中的一个下楼，就恶狠狠地问他打算把她的公寓当作什么地方。高老头回答说这位太太是他的大女儿。

“你女儿有两三打吗？”伏盖太太尖刻地说。

“我只有两个。”高老头答话的口气非常柔和，正如一个落难的人，什么贫穷的委屈都受得了。

快满第三年的时候，高老头还要节省开支，搬上四层楼，每个月的房饭钱只有四十五法郎了。他戒掉了鼻烟，打发了理发匠，头上也不再扑粉。高老头第一次不扑粉下楼，房东太太大吃一惊，直叫起来；他的头发原是灰中带绿的腌臜颜色。他的面貌被暗中的忧患磨得一天比一天难看，似乎成了饭桌上最忧郁的一张脸。如今是毫无疑问了：高老头是一个老色鬼。要不是医生本领高强，他的眼睛早就保不住，因为治他那种病的药品是有副作用的。他的头发所以颜色那么丑恶，也是由于他纵欲无度，和服用那些使他继续纵欲的药物之故。可怜虫的精神与身体的情形，使那些无稽之谈显得凿凿有据。漂亮的被褥衣物用旧了，他买十四铜子一码的棉布来代替。金刚钻，金烟匣，金链条，饰物，一样一样地不见了。他脱下宝蓝大褂跟那些华丽的服装，不分冬夏，只穿一件栗色粗呢大褂，羊毛背心，灰色毛料长裤。他越来越瘦，腿肚子掉了下去；从前因心满意足而肥胖的脸，不知打了多少皱裥；脑门上有了沟槽，牙床骨突了出来。他住到圣·日内维新街的第四年上，完全变了样。六十二岁时的面条商，看上去不满四十，又胖又肥的小财主，仿佛不久才荒唐过来，雄赳赳气昂昂，教路人看了也痛快，笑容也颇有青春气息；如今忽然像七十老翁，龙龙钟钟，摇摇晃晃，面如死灰。当初那么生气勃勃的蓝眼睛，变了黯淡的铁灰色，转成苍白，眼泪水也不淌了，殷红的眼眶好似在流血。有些人觉得他可憎，有些人觉得他可怜。一般年轻的医学生注意到他下唇低垂，量了量他面角的顶尖，再三戏弄他而什么话都探不出来之后，说他害着甲状腺肿大。[23]

有一天黄昏，吃过饭，伏盖太太挖苦他说：“啊，喂！她们不来看你了吗，你那些女儿？”口气之间显然怀疑他做父亲的身份。高老头一听之下，浑身发抖，仿佛给房东太太刺了一针。

“有时候来的。”他声音抖动地回答。

“哎啊！有时你还看到她们！”那般大学生齐声嚷着，“真了不起，高老头！”

老人并没听见他的答话所引起的嘲笑，又恢复了迷迷糊糊的神气。光从表面上观察的人以为他老态龙钟。倘使对他彻底认识了，也许大家会觉得他的身心交瘁是个大大的疑案；可是认识他真是谈何容易。要打听高里奥是否做过面条生意，有多少财产，都不是难事；无奈那般注意他的老年人从来不走出本区的街坊，老躲在公寓里像牡蛎黏着岩石；至于旁人，巴黎生活特有的诱惑，使他们一走出圣·日内维新街便忘记了他们所调侃的可怜老头。头脑狭窄的人和漠不关心的年轻人，一致认为以高老头那种寒碜，那种蠢头蠢脑，根本谈不上有什么财产或本领。至于他称为女儿的那些婆娘，大家都接受伏盖太太的意见。像她那种每天晚上以嚼舌为事的老太婆，对什么事都爱乱猜，结果自有一套严密的逻辑，她说：

“要是高老头真有那么有钱的女儿，像来看他的那些女客，他决不会住在我四层楼上，每月只付四十五法郎的房饭钱，也不会穿得像穷人一样地上街了。”

没有一件事情可以推翻这个结论。所以到一八一九年十一月底，这幕惨剧爆发的时期，公寓里每个人都对可怜的老头儿有了极其肯定的意见。他压根儿不曾有过什么妻儿子女；荒淫的结果使他变成了一条蜗牛，一个人形的软体动物，据一个包饭客人，博物院职员说，应当列入加斯葛底番类[24]。跟高老头比较起来，波阿莱竟是老鹰一般，大有绅士气派了。波阿莱会说话，会理论，会对答；虽然他的说话、理论、对答，只是用不同的字眼重复旁人的话；但他究竟参加谈话，他是活的，还像有知觉的；不比高老头，照那博物院职员的说法，在寒暑表上永远指着零度。

欧也纳·特·拉斯蒂涅过了暑假回来，他的心情正和一般英俊有为的青年或是因家境艰难而暂时显得高卓的人一样。寄寓巴黎的第一年，法科学生考初级文凭的作业并不多，尽可享受巴黎的繁华。要知道每个戏院的戏码，摸出巴黎迷宫的线索，学会规矩，谈吐，把京城里特有的娱乐搅上瘾，走遍好好坏坏的地方，选听有趣的课程，背得出各个博物院的宝藏……一个大学生决不嫌时间太多。他会对无聊的小事情入迷，觉得伟大得了不得。他有他的大人物，例如法兰西学院的什么教授，拿了薪水吸引群众的人。他整着领带，对喜歌剧院楼厅里的妇女搔首弄姿。一样一样地入门以后，他就脱了壳，扩大眼界，终于体会到社会的各阶层是怎样重叠起来的。大太阳的日子，在香榭丽舍大道上辐辏成行的车马，他刚会欣赏，跟着就眼红了。

欧也纳得了文学士和法学士学位，回乡过暑假的时节，已经不知不觉经过这些学习。童年的幻象，外省人的观念，完全消灭了。见识改换，雄心奋发之下，他看清了老家的情形。父亲，母亲，两个兄弟，两个妹妹，和一个除了养老金外别无财产的姑母，统统住在拉斯蒂涅家小小的田地上。年收三千法郎左右的田，进款并没把握，因为葡萄的行情跟着酒市上落，可是每年总得凑出一千二百法郎给他。家里一向为了疼他而瞒起的常年窘迫的景象；他把小时候觉得那么美丽的妹妹，和他认为美的典型的巴黎妇女所做的比较；压在他肩上的这个大家庭的渺茫的前途；眼见任何微末的农作物都珍藏起来的俭省的习惯；用榨床上的残渣剩滓制造的家常饮料，总之，在此无须一一列举的许多琐事，使他对于权位的欲望与出人头地的志愿，加强了十倍。像一切有志气的人，他发愿一切都要靠自己的本领去挣。但他的性格明明是南方人的性格：临到实行就狐疑不决，主意动摇了，仿佛青年人在汪洋大海中间，既不知向哪方面驶去，也不知把帆挂成怎样的角度。先是他想没头没脑地用功，后来又感到应酬交际的必要，发觉女子对社会生活影响极大，突然想投身上流社会，去征服几个可以做他后台的妇女。一个有热情有才气的青年，加上倜傥风流的仪表，和很容易叫女人着迷的那种阳性的美，还愁找不到那样的女子吗？他一边在田野里散步一边不断转着这些念头。从前他同妹妹们出来闲逛完全无忧无虑，如今她们觉得他大大地变了。他的姑母特·玛西阿太太，当年也曾入宫觐见，认识一批名门贵族的领袖。野心勃勃的青年忽然记起姑母时常讲给他听的回忆中，有不少机会好让他到社会上去显露头角，这一点至少跟他在法学院的成就同样重要；他便盘问姑母，那些还能拉到关系的人是怎么样的亲戚。老姑太太把家谱上的各支各脉想了一想，认为在所有自私的阔亲戚中间，特·鲍赛昂子爵夫人大概最容易相与。她用老派的体裁写了封信交给欧也纳，说如果能接近这位子爵夫人，她自会帮他找到其余的亲戚。回到巴黎几天之后，拉斯蒂涅把姑母的信寄给特·鲍赛昂夫人，夫人寄来一张第二天的跳舞会的请帖，代替复信。

以上是一八一九年十一月底公寓里的大概情形。过了几天，欧也纳参加了特·鲍赛昂太太的舞会，清早两点左右回家。为了补偿损失的光阴，勇气十足的大学生一边跳舞一边发愿回去开夜车。他预备第一次在这个万籁无声的区域中熬夜，自以为精力充沛，其实只是见到豪华的场面的冲动。那晚他没有在伏盖太太家用餐，同居的人可能以为他要天亮回来，好像他有几次赴柏拉杜舞会[25]或奥迪安舞会，丝袜上溅满污泥，漆皮鞋走了样地回家。克利斯朵夫拴上大门之前，开出门来向街上瞧了瞧。拉斯蒂涅恰好在这时赶回，悄悄地上楼，跟在他后面上楼的克利斯朵夫却闹出许多响声。欧也纳进了卧房，卸了装，换上软鞋，披了一件破大褂，点起泥炭，急匆匆地准备用功。克利斯朵夫笨重的脚声还没有完，把青年人轻微的响动盖过了。

欧也纳没有开始读书，先出神地想了一会。他看出特·鲍赛昂子爵夫人是当今的阔太太之一，她的府第被认为圣·日耳曼区[26]最愉快的地方。以门第与财产而论，她也是贵族社会的一个领袖。靠了特·玛西阿姑母的力量，这个穷学生居然受到鲍府的优待，可还不知道这优待的作用多大。能够在那些金碧辉煌的客厅中露面，就等于一纸阀阅世家的证书。一朝踏进了这个比任何社会都不容易进去的地方，可以到处通行无阻。盛会中的鬓光钗影看得他眼睛都花了；他和子爵夫人仅仅寒暄了几句，便在那般争先恐后赴此晚会的巴黎女神中，发现了一个教青年人一见倾心的女子。阿娜斯大齐·特·雷斯多伯爵夫人生得端正，高大，被称为巴黎身腰最好看的美人之一。一对漆黑的大眼睛，美丽的手，有样的脚，举动之间流露出热情的火焰；这样一个女人，照特·龙格罗侯爵的说法，是一匹纯血种的马。泼辣的气息并没影响她的美；身腰丰满圆浑而并不肥胖。纯血种的马，贵种的美人，这些成语已经开始代替天上的安琪儿，仙女般的脸庞，以及新派公子哥儿早已唾弃不用的关于爱情的老神话。在拉斯蒂涅心目中，阿娜斯大齐·特·雷斯多夫人干脆就是一个迷人的女子。他想法在她的扇子上登记了两次[27]，并且在第一次四组舞时就有机会对她说：

“以后在哪儿跟你见面呢，太太？”说话之间那股热情冲动的劲儿，正是女人们最喜欢的。

“森林[28]啊，喜剧院啊，我家里啊，到处都可以。”她回答。

于是这南方的冒险家，在一场四组舞或华尔兹舞中间可能接触的范围内，竭力和这个动人心魄的伯爵夫人周旋。一经说明他是特·鲍赛昂太太的表弟，他心目中的那位贵妇人立刻邀请他，说随时可以上她家去玩儿。她对他最后一次的微笑，使他觉得登门拜访之举是少不了的了。宾客之中有的是当时出名放肆的男人，什么摩冷古，龙格罗，玛克辛·特·脱拉伊，特·玛赛，阿瞿达—宾多，王特奈斯，都是自命不凡、煊赫一世之辈，尽跟最风雅的妇女们厮混，例如勃朗同爵士夫人，特·朗日公爵夫人，特·甘尔迦罗哀伯爵夫人，特·赛里齐夫人，特·加里里阿诺公爵夫人，法洛伯爵夫人，特·朗蒂夫人，特·哀格勒蒙侯爵夫人，菲尔米阿尼夫人，特·李斯多曼侯爵夫人，特·埃斯巴侯爵夫人，特·摩弗里纽斯公爵夫人，葛朗第安夫人。在这等场合，年轻人闹出不通世面的笑话是最糟糕的。拉斯蒂涅遇到的幸而不是一个嘲笑他愚昧无知的人，而是特·朗日公爵夫人的情人，特·蒙脱里伏侯爵，一位淳朴如儿童的将军，告诉他特·雷斯多伯爵夫人住在海尔特街。

年纪轻轻，渴想踏进上流社会，饥荒似的想弄一个女人，眼见高门大户已有两处打通了路子：在圣·日耳曼区能够跨进特·鲍赛昂子爵夫人的府第，在唐打区[29]能够在特·雷斯多伯爵夫人家出入！一眼之间望到一连串的巴黎沙龙，自以为相当英俊，足够博取女人的欢心而得到她的帮助与庇护！也自认为雄心勃勃，尽可像江湖卖技的汉子似的，走在绳索上四平八稳，飞起大腿做一番精彩表演，把一个迷人的女子当作一个最好的平衡棒，支持他的重心！脑中转着这些念头，那女人仿佛就巍巍然站在他的炭火旁边，站在法典与贫穷之间；在这种情形之下，谁又能不像欧也纳一样沉思遐想，探索自己的前途，谁又能不用成功的幻想点缀前途？他正在胡思乱想，觉得将来的幸福十拿九稳，甚至自以为已经在特·雷斯多太太身旁了；不料静悄悄的夜里忽然“哼”的一声叹息，欧也纳听了几乎以为是病人的痰厥。他轻轻开了门，走入甬道，瞥见高老头房门底下有一线灯光；他怕邻居病了，凑上锁孔张望，不料老人干的事非常可疑，欧也纳觉得为了公众安全，应当把自称为的面条商深更半夜干的勾当看个明白。原来高老头把一张桌子仰倒着，在桌子横档上缚了一个镀金的盘和一件好似汤钵一类的东西，另外用根粗绳绞着那些镌刻精工的器物，拼命拉紧，似乎要绞成金条。老人不声不响，用筋脉隆起的胳膊，靠绳索帮忙，扭着镀金的银器，像捏面粉一般。

“哟！好家伙！”拉斯蒂涅私下想着，挺起身子站了一会，“他是一个贼还是一个窝赃的？是不是为了遮人耳目，故意装疯作傻，过着叫花子般的生活？”

大学生又把眼睛凑上锁孔，只见高老头解开绳索，拿起银块，在桌上铺了一条毯子，把银块放在上面卷滚，非常利落地搓成一根条子。条子快搓成的时候，欧也纳心上想：“难道他力气跟波兰王奥古斯德一样大吗？”

高老头伤心地瞧了瞧他的作品，掉下几滴眼泪，吹灭蜡烛，躺上床去，叹了一口气。

欧也纳私忖道：“他疯了。”

“可怜的孩子！”高老头忽然叫了一声。

听到这一句，拉斯蒂涅认为这件事还是不声张为妙，觉得不该冒冒失失断定邻居是坏人。他正要回房，又听见一种难以形容的声音，大概是几个穿布底鞋的人上楼梯。欧也纳侧耳细听，果然有两个人不同的呼吸，既没有开门声，也没有脚步声，忽然三楼伏脱冷的屋内漏出一道微光。

“一所公寓里竟有这么些怪事！”他一边想一边走下几级听着，居然还有洋钱的声音。一忽儿，灯光灭了，没有开门的声音，却又听到两个人的呼吸。他们慢慢地下楼，声音也就跟着低下去。

“谁啊？”伏盖太太打开卧房的窗子问。

“是我回来喔，伏盖妈妈。”伏脱冷大声回答。

“真怪！”欧也纳回到房内想，“克利斯朵夫明明把大门上了闩。在巴黎真要通宵不睡才弄得清周围的事。”

这些小事打断了他关于爱情的幻想，他开始用功了。可是，他先是猜疑高老头，心思乱了，而打扰得更厉害的是特·雷斯多太太的面貌不时出现，仿佛一个预告幸运的使者；结果他上床睡熟了。年轻人发狠要在夜里读书，十有九夜是睡觉完事的。要熬夜，一定要过二十岁。

第二天早上，巴黎浓雾蔽天，罩住全城，连最准时的人也弄错了时间。生意上的约会全失误了，中午十二点，大家还当是八点。九点半，伏盖太太在床上还没动弹。克利斯朵夫和胖子西尔维也起迟了，正在消消停停地喝他们的咖啡，里面羼着从房客的牛奶上撩起来的一层乳脂。西尔维把牛乳放在火上尽煮，教伏盖太太看不出他们揩油的痕迹。

克利斯朵夫把第一块烤面包浸在咖啡里，说道：“喂，西尔维，你知道，伏脱冷先生是个好人；昨晚又有两个客人来看他。太太要有什么疑心，你一个字都别提。”

“他有没有给你什么？”

“五法郎，算本月份的赏钱，意思叫我不要声张。”

西尔维回答：“除了他跟古的太太舍得花钱以外，旁的都想把新年里右手给的，左手拿回去！”

“哼！他们给的也是天晓得！”克利斯朵夫接着说，“一块起码洋钱，五法郎！高老头自己擦皮鞋擦了两年了。波阿莱那小气鬼根本不用鞋油，大概他宁可吞在肚里，舍不得擦他的破靴子。至于那瘦小的大学生，他只给两法郎。两法郎还不够我买鞋刷，临了他还卖掉他的旧衣服。真是没出息的地方！”

西尔维一小口一小口喝着咖啡。“话得说回来，咱们这个还算这一区的好差事哩。哎，克利斯朵夫，关于伏脱冷先生，人家有没有对你说过什么？”

“怎么没有！前几天街上有位先生和我说：你们那里住着一位鬓角染黑的胖子是不是？——我回答说：不，先生。他并没有染鬓角。他那样爱寻快活的人，才没有这个闲工夫呢。我把这个告诉了伏脱冷先生，他说：伙计，你对付得好！以后就这样说吧。顶讨厌是给人家知道我们的缺点，娶起亲来不麻烦吗？”

“也有人在菜市上哄我，要知道我有没有看见他穿衬衫。你想好笑不好笑！”西尔维忽然转过话头：“哟！华·特·葛拉斯已经敲九点三刻了，还没一个人动弹。”

“啊，喂！他们都出去啦。古的太太同她的小姑娘八点钟就上圣·丹蒂安拜老天爷去了。高老头挟着一个小包上街了。大学生要十点钟上完课才回来。我打扫楼梯的时候看他们出去的；我还给高老头的小包裹撞了一下，硬得像铁。这老头儿究竟在干什么呢？旁人耍弄他，当作陀螺一样，人倒是挺好的，比他们都强。他不给什么钱，可是我替他送信去的地方，那般太太酒钱给得很阔气，穿也穿得漂亮。”

“是他所说的那些女儿吗，嗯？统共有一打吧？”

“我一向只去过两家，就是到这儿来过的两个。”

“太太起来了；一忽儿就要叫叫嚷嚷的，我该上去了。你当心着牛奶，克利斯朵夫，仔细那猫儿。”

西尔维走进女主人的屋子。

“怎么？西尔维，已经十点差一刻了，你让我睡得像死人一样！真是从来没有的事！”

“那是浓雾作怪，浓得用刀劈也劈不开。”

“中饭怎么了？”[30]

“呕！那些房客都见了鬼，一太早就滚出去了。”

“说话要清楚，西尔维。应该说一大早。”

“哦！太太，你要我怎么说都可以。包你十点钟有饭吃。米旭诺跟波阿莱还没动弹。只有他们俩在家，睡得像猪一样。”

“西尔维，你把他们两个放在一块儿讲，好像……”

“好像什么？”西尔维大声痴笑起来，“两个不是一双吗？”

“真怪，西尔维，昨夜克利斯朵夫把大门上了闩，怎么伏脱冷先生还能进来？”

“不是的，太太。他听见伏脱冷先生回来，下去开门的。你当作……”

“把短袄给我，快快去弄饭。剩下的羊肉再加些番薯；饭后点心用煮熟梨子，挑两个小钱[31]一个的。”

过了一会，伏盖太太下楼了，她的猫刚刚一脚掀开罩盆，急匆匆地舐着牛奶。

“咪斯蒂格里！”她叫了一声，猫逃了，又回来在她腿边厮磨。“好，好，你拍马屁，你这老畜生！”

她接着又叫：“西尔维！西尔维！”

“哎，哎，什么事呀，太太？”

“你瞧，猫喝掉了多少！”

“都是混账的克利斯朵夫不好，我早告诉他摆桌子，他到哪儿去了？不用急，太太；那份牛奶倒在高老头的咖啡里吧。让我冲些水，他不会发觉的。他对什么都不在意，连吃什么都不知道。”

“他上哪儿去了，这怪物？”伏盖太太摆着盘子，问。

“谁知道？大概在跟魔鬼打交道吧。”

“我睡得太多了。”伏盖太太说。

“可是太太，你新鲜得像一朵玫瑰……”

这时门铃一响，伏脱冷大声唱着，走进客厅：





我久已走遍了世界，

人家到处看见我呀……





“哦！哦！你早，伏盖妈妈。”他招呼了房东，又亲热地拥抱她。

“喂，放手呀。”

“干吗不说放肆呀！”他回答，“说啊，说我放肆啊！哦，哦，我来帮你摆桌子。你看我多好！……





勾搭褐发和金发的姑娘，

爱一阵呀叹一声……





“我才看见一桩怪事……





……全是偶然……”





寡妇道：“什么事？”

“高老头八点半在太子街，拿了一套镀金餐具，走进一家收买旧食器旧肩章的银匠铺，卖了一笔好价钱。亏他不吃这行饭的人，绞出来的条子倒很像样呢。”

“真的？”

“当然真的。我有个伙计出远门，送他上了邮车回来，我看到高老头，就想瞧瞧是怎么回事。他回到本区格莱街上，走进放印子钱的高布赛克家；你知道高布赛克是个了不起的坏蛋，会把他老子的背脊梁雕成骰子的家伙！真是个犹太人，阿拉伯人，希腊人，波希米人，哼，你休想抢到他的钱，他把洋钱都存在银行里。”

“那么高老头去干什么？”

“干什么？吃尽当光！”伏脱冷回答，“这糊涂虫不惜倾家荡产去爱那些婊子……”

“他来了！”西尔维叫着。

“克利斯朵夫，你上来。”高老头招呼用人。

克利斯朵夫跟着高老头上楼，一忽儿下来了。

“你上哪儿去？”伏盖太太问。

“替高里奥先生跑一趟。”

“什么东西呀？”伏脱冷说着，从克利斯朵夫手中抢过一个信封，念道：送阿娜斯大齐·特·雷斯多伯爵夫人。他把信还给克利斯朵夫，问：“送哪儿呢？”

“海尔特街。他吩咐一定要面交伯爵夫人。”

“里面是什么东西？”伏脱冷把信照着亮处说，“钞票？不是的。”他把信封拆开一点：“哦，是一张债务清讫的借票。嘿！这老妖精倒有义气！”他伸出大手摸了摸克利斯朵夫的头发，把他的身体像骰子般骨碌碌地转了几下，“去吧，坏东西，你又好挣几个酒钱了。”

刀叉杯盘已经摆好。西尔维正在煮牛奶。伏盖太太生着火炉，伏脱冷在旁帮忙，嘴里哼着：





我久已走遍了世界，

人家到处看见我呀……





一切准备停当，古的太太和泰伊番小姐回来了。

“这么早到哪儿去啦，漂亮的太太？”伏盖太太问。

“我们在圣·丹蒂安教堂祈祷。今儿不是要去泰伊番先生家吗？可怜的孩子浑身哆嗦，像一张树叶。”古的太太说着坐在火炉前面，鞋子搁在火门口冒起烟来。

“来烤火吧，维多莉。”伏盖太太说。

“小姐，”伏脱冷端了一把椅子给她，“求上帝使你父亲回心转意固然不错，可是不够。还得有个朋友去教这个丑八怪把头脑醒醒。听说这蛮子手头有三百万，偏偏不肯给你一分陪嫁。这年月，一个美人儿是少不得陪嫁的。”

“可怜的孩子，”伏盖太太接口道，“你那魔王老子不怕报应吗？”

一听这几句，维多莉眼睛湿了；伏盖太太看见古的太太对她摆摆手，就不出声了。

军需官的寡妇接着说：“只要我能见到他的面，和他说话，把他妻子的遗书交给他，也就罢了。我从来不敢冒险从邮局寄去；他认得我的笔迹……”

“哦！那些无辜的女人，遭着灾殃，受着欺侮，”伏脱冷这么嚷着，忽然停下，说：“你现在就是落到这个田地！过几天让我来管这笔账，包你称心满意。”

“哦！先生，”维多莉一边说，一边对伏脱冷又畏怯又热烈地望了一眼，伏脱冷却毫不动心，“倘若你有方法见到家父，请你告诉他，说我把父亲的慈爱和母亲的名誉，看得比世界上所有的财宝都贵重。如果你能把他的铁石心肠劝转一些，我要在上帝面前为你祈祷，我一定感激不尽……”

“我久已走遍了世界……”伏脱冷用讽刺的口吻唱着。

这时高里奥、米旭诺小姐、波阿莱都下楼了，也许都闻到了肉汁的味道，那是西尔维做来浇在隔夜的羊肉上的。七个同居的人正在互相问好，围着桌子坐下，时钟敲了十点，大学生的脚步也在门外响了。

“嗳，行啦，欧也纳先生，”西尔维说，“今儿你可以跟大家一块儿吃饭了。”

大学生招呼了同居，在高老头身旁坐下。

“我今天有桩意想不到的奇遇。”他说着夹了好些羊肉，割了一块面包——伏盖太太老在那里估计面包的大小。

“奇遇！”波阿莱叫道。

“哎！你大惊小怪干什么，老糊涂？”伏脱冷对波阿莱说。“难道他老人家不配吗？”

泰伊番小姐怯生生地对大学生瞧了一眼。

伏盖太太说道：“把你的奇遇讲给我们听吧。”

“昨天我去赴特·鲍赛昂子爵夫人的舞会，她是我的表姊，有一所华丽的住宅，每间屋子都铺满了绫罗绸缎。她举行一个盛大的跳舞会，把我乐得像一个皇帝……”

“像黄雀。”伏脱冷打断了他的话。

“先生，”欧也纳气恼地问，“你这是什么意思？”

“我说黄雀，因为黄雀比皇帝快活得多。”

应声虫波阿莱说：“不错，我宁可做一只无忧无虑的黄雀，不要做皇帝，因为……”

“总之，”大学生截住了波阿莱的话，“我同舞会里最漂亮的一位太太跳舞，一位千娇百媚的伯爵夫人，真的，我从没见过那样的美人儿。她头上插着桃花，胸部又是最好看的花球，都是喷香的鲜花；啊唷！真要你们亲眼看见才行。一个女人跳舞跳上了劲，真是难画难描。唉！哪知今儿早上九点，我看见这位神仙似的伯爵夫人在格莱街上走。哦！我的心跳啦，以为……”

“以为她上这儿来，嗯？”伏脱冷对大学生深深地瞧了一眼。“其实她是去找放印子钱的高布赛克老头。要是你在巴黎妇女的心窝里掏一下，包你先发现债主，后看见情夫。你的伯爵夫人叫作阿娜斯大齐·特·雷斯多，住在海尔特街。”

一听见这个名字，大学生瞪着伏脱冷。高老头猛地抬起头来，把他们俩瞧了一眼，又明亮又焦急的目光教大家看了奇怪。

“克利斯朵夫走晚了一步，她到过那儿了。”高里奥不胜懊恼地自言自语。

“我猜着了。”伏脱冷咬着伏盖太太的耳朵。

高老头糊里糊涂地吃着东西，根本不知道吃的什么；愣头傻脑、心不在焉到这个程度，他还从来不曾有过。

欧也纳问：“伏脱冷先生，她的名字谁告诉你的？”

伏脱冷回答：“嗳！嗳！既然高老头会知道，干吗我不能知道？”

“什么！高里奥先生？”大学生叫起来。

“真的？昨天晚上她很漂亮吗？”可怜的老人问。

“谁？”

“特·雷斯多太太。”

“你瞧这老东西眼睛多亮。”伏盖太太对伏脱冷说。

“他难道养着那个女人吗？”米旭诺小姐低声问大学生。

“哦！是的，她漂亮得了不得，”欧也纳回答高老头，高老头不胜艳羡地望着他，“要没有特·鲍赛昂太太，那位神仙般的伯爵夫人竟可以算全场的王后了；年轻人的眼睛只钉住她一个，我在她的登记表上已经是第十二名，没有一次四组舞没有她，旁的女人都气坏了。昨天她的确是最得意的人。常言道：天下之美，莫过于满帆的巨舶，飞奔的骏马，婆娑起舞的美女，真是一点不错。”

“昨天在爵府的高堂上，今儿早晨在债主的脚底下，这便是巴黎女人的本相，”伏脱冷说，“丈夫要供给不起她们挥霍，她们就出卖自己。要不就破开母亲的肚子，搜搜刮刮地拿去摆架子，总而言之，她们什么千奇百怪的事都做得出。唉，有的是，有的是！”

高老头听了大学生的话，眉飞色舞，像晴天的太阳；听到伏脱冷刻毒的议论，立刻沉下了脸。

伏盖太太道：“你还没说出你的奇遇呢。你刚才有没有跟她说话？她要不要跟你补习法律？”

欧也纳道：“她没有看见我；可是九点钟在格莱街上碰到一个巴黎顶美的美人儿，清早两点才跳完舞回家的女子，不古怪吗？只有巴黎才会碰到这等怪事。”

“吓！比这个更怪的事还多咧。”伏脱冷嚷道。

泰伊番小姐并没留神他们的话，只想着等会儿要去尝试的事。古的太太向她递了个眼色，教她去换衣服。她们俩一走，高老头也跟着走了。

“喂，瞧见没有？”伏盖太太对伏脱冷和其余的房客说，“他明明是给那些婆娘弄穷的。”

大学生叫道：“我无论如何不相信美丽的伯爵夫人是高老头的情妇。”

“我们并没要你相信啊，”伏脱冷截住了他的话，“你年纪太轻，还没熟悉巴黎。慢慢你会知道自有一般所谓痴情汉……”

（米旭诺小姐听了这一句，会心地瞧了瞧伏脱冷，仿佛战马听见了号角。）

“哎！哎！”伏脱冷停了一下，深深地瞪了她一眼，“咱们都不是有过一点儿小小的痴情吗？……”

（老姑娘低下眼睛，好似女修士见到裸体雕像。）

伏脱冷又道：“再说，那些人啊，一朝有了一个念头就抓住不放。他们只认定一口井喝水，往往还是臭水；为了要喝这臭水，他们肯出卖老婆、孩子，或者把自己的灵魂卖给魔鬼。在某些人，这口井是赌场，是交易所，是收古画，收集昆虫，或者是音乐；在另外一些人，也许是做得一手好菜的女人。世界上所有的女人，他们都不在乎，一心一意只要满足自己疯魔的那个。往往那女的根本不爱他们，凶悍泼辣，教他们付很高的代价换一点儿小小的满足。唉！唉！那些傻蛋可没有厌倦的时候，他们会把最后一床被窝送进长生库，换几个最后的钱去孝敬她。高老头便是这等人。伯爵夫人剥削他，因为他不会声张；这就叫作上流社会！可怜的老头儿只想着她。一出痴情的范围，你们亲眼看到，他简直是个蠢笨的畜生。提到他那一门，他眼睛就发亮，像金刚钻。这个秘密是容易猜到的。今儿早上他把镀金盘子送进银匠铺，我又看他上格莱街高布赛克老头家。再看他的下文。回到这儿，他教克利斯朵夫送信给特·雷斯多太太，咱们都看见信封上的地址，里面是一张债务清讫的借票。要是伯爵夫人也去过那放债的家里，显见情形是紧急得很了。高老头很慷慨地替她还债。用不到多少联想，咱们就看清楚了。告诉你，年轻的大学生，当你的伯爵夫人嬉笑跳舞，搔首弄姿，把她的桃花一摇一摆，尖尖的手指拈着裙角的时候，她是像俗语所说的，大脚套在小鞋里，正想着她的或是她情人的，到了期付不出的借票。”

欧也纳叫道：“你们这么一说，我非把事情弄清楚不可了。明儿我就上特·雷斯多太太家。”

“对，”波阿莱接口道，“明儿就得上特·雷斯多太太家。”

“说不定你会碰到高老头放了情分在那边收账呢！”

欧也纳不胜厌恶地说：“那么你们的巴黎竟是一个垃圾坑了。”

“而且是一个古怪的垃圾坑，”伏脱冷接着说，“凡是浑身污泥而坐在车上的都是正人君子，浑身污泥而搬着两条腿走的都是小人流氓。扒窃一件随便什么东西，你就给牵到法院广场上去展览，大家拿你当把戏看。偷上一百万，交际场中就说你大贤大德。你们花三千万养着宪兵队和司法人员来维持这种道德。妙极了！”

“怎么，”伏盖太太插嘴道，“高老头把他的镀金餐具熔掉了？”

“盖上有两只小鸽的是不是？”欧也纳问。

“是呀。”

“大概那是他心爱的东西，”欧也纳说，“他毁掉那只碗跟盘的时候，他哭了。我无意中看到的。”

“那是他看作性命一般的呢。”寡妇回答。

“你们瞧这家伙多痴情！”伏脱冷叫道，“那女人有本领迷得他心眼儿都痒了。”

大学生上楼了，伏脱冷出门了。过了一会，古的太太和维多莉坐上西尔维叫来的马车。波阿莱搀着米旭诺小姐，上植物园去消磨一天之中最舒服的两个钟点。

“哎哟！他们这不像结了婚？”胖子西尔维说，“今儿他们第一次一块儿出去。两口儿都是又干又硬，碰起来一定会爆出火星，像打火石一样呢。”

“米旭诺小姐真要当心她的披肩才好，”伏盖太太笑道，“要不就会像艾绒一样烧起来的。”

四点钟，高里奥回来了，在两盏冒烟的油灯下看见维多莉红着眼睛。伏盖太太听她们讲着白天去看泰伊番先生一无结果的情形。他因为给女儿和这个老太太纠缠不清，终于答应接见，好跟她们说个明白。

“好太太，”古的太太对伏盖太太说，“你想得到吗，他对维多莉连坐也不教坐，让她从头至尾站在那里。对我，他并没动火，可是冷冷地对我说，以后不必再劳驾上他的门；说小姐（不说他的女儿）越跟他麻烦，（一年一次就说麻烦，这魔王！）越惹他厌；又说维多莉的母亲当初并没有陪嫁，所以她不能有什么要求；反正是许多狠心的话，把可怜的姑娘哭得泪人儿似的。她扑在父亲脚下，勇敢地说，她的劳苦哀求只是为了母亲，她愿意服从父亲的意旨，一点不敢抱怨，但求他把亡母的遗嘱读一遍。于是她呈上信去，说着世界上最温柔最诚心的话，不知她从哪儿学来的，一定是上帝的启示吧，因为可怜的孩子说得那么至情至性，把我听的人都哭昏了。哪想到老昏君铰着指甲，拿起可怜的泰伊番太太浸透眼泪的信，往壁炉里一扔，说道：‘好！’他想扶起跪在地下的女儿，一看见她捧着他的手要亲吻，马上缩了回去。你看他多恶！他那脓包儿子跑进来，对他的亲妹妹理都不理。”

“难道他们是野兽吗？”高里奥插了一句。

“后来，”古的太太并没留意高老头的慨叹，“父子俩对我点点头走了，说有要事。这便是我们今天拜访的经过。至少，他见过了女儿。我不懂他怎么会不认她，父女相像得跟两滴水一样。”

包饭的和寄宿的客人陆续来了，彼此问好，说些无聊的废话。在巴黎某些社会中，这种废话，加上古怪的发音和手势，就算诙谑，主要是荒唐胡闹。这一类的俗语常常在变化，作为根据的笑料不到一个月就听不见了。什么政治事件，刑事案子，街上的小调，戏子的插科打诨，都可以做这种游戏的材料，把思想、言语，当作羽毛球一般抛来抛去。一种新发明的玩意叫作狄奥喇嘛（diorama），比透景像真画（panorama）把光学的幻景更推进一步；某些画室用这个字打哈哈，无论说什么，字尾总添上一个喇嘛（rama）。有一个年轻的画家在伏盖公寓包饭，把这笑料带了来。

“啊，喂！波阿莱先生，”博物院管事说，“你的健康喇嘛怎么啦？”不等他回答，又对古的太太和维多莉说：“太太们，你们心里难受，是不是？”

“快开饭了吗？”荷拉斯·皮安训问。他是医科学生，拉斯蒂涅的朋友。“我的宝贝胃儿快要掉到脚底下去了。”

“天冷得要冰喇嘛！”伏脱冷叫着，“让一让啊，高老头。该死！你的脚把火门全占了。”

皮安训道：“大名鼎鼎的伏脱冷先生，干吗你说冷得要冰喇嘛？那是不对的。应该说冷得要命喇嘛。”

“不，”博物院管事说，“应当说冷得要冰喇嘛，意思是说我的脚冷。”

“啊！啊！原来如此！”

“嘿！拉斯蒂涅侯爵大人阁下，胡扯法学博士来了，”皮安训一边嚷一边抱着欧也纳的脖子，教他透不过气来，“哦！嗨！诸位，哦！嗨！”

米旭诺小姐轻轻地进来，一言不发对众人点点头，坐在三位太太旁边。

“我一看见她就打寒噤，这只老蝙蝠，”皮安训指着米旭诺低声对伏脱冷说，“我研究迦尔的骨相学，[32]发觉她有犹大的反骨。”

“你先生认识犹大吗？”伏脱冷问。

“谁没有碰到过犹大？”皮安训回答，“我敢打赌，这个没有血色的老姑娘，就像那些长条的虫，梁木都会给它们蛀空的。”

伏脱冷理着鬓角，说道：“这就叫作，孩子啊，


那蔷薇，就像所有的蔷薇，

只开了一个早晨。”



看见克利斯朵夫恭恭敬敬端了汤盂出来，波阿莱叫道：

“啊！啊！出色的喇嘛汤来了。”

“对不起，先生，”伏盖太太道，“那是蔬菜汤。”

所有的青年人都大声笑了。

“输了，波阿莱！”

“波阿莱输了！”

“给伏盖妈妈记上两分。”伏脱冷道。

博物院管事问：“可有人注意到今儿早上的雾吗？”

皮安训道：“那是一场狂雾，惨雾，绿雾，忧郁的、闷塞的、高里奥式的雾。”

“高里奥喇嘛的雾，”画家道，“因为混混沌沌，什么都瞧不见。”

“喂，葛里奥脱老爷，提到你啦。”

高老头坐在桌子横头，靠近端菜的门。他抬起头来，把饭巾下面的面包凑近鼻子去闻，那是他偶然流露的生意上的老习惯。

“哟！”伏盖太太带着尖刻的口气，粗大的嗓子盖住了羹匙、盘子和谈话的声音，“是不是面包不行？”

“不是的，太太。那用的是哀当卜面粉，头等货色。”

“你凭什么知道的？”欧也纳问。

“凭那种白，凭那种味道。”

“凭你鼻子里的味道，既然你闻着嗅着，”伏盖太太说，“你省俭到极点，有朝一日单靠厨房的气味就能过活的。”

博物院管事道：“那你不妨去领一张发明执照，倒好发一笔财哩。”

画家说：“别理他。他这么做，不过是教人相信他做过面条生意。”

“那么，”博物院管事又追问一句，“你的鼻子竟是一个提炼食物精华的蒸馏瓶了。”

“蒸——什么？”皮安训问。

“蒸饼。”

“蒸笼。”

“蒸汽。”

“蒸鱼。”

“蒸包子。”

“蒸茄子。”

“蒸黄瓜。”

“蒸黄瓜喇嘛。”

这八句回答从室内四面八方传来，像连珠炮似的，把大家笑得不可开交，高老头愈加目瞪口呆地望着众人，好像要想法懂一种外国话似的。

“蒸什么？”他问身旁的伏脱冷。

“蒸猪脚，朋友！”伏脱冷一边回答，一边望高里奥头上拍了一下，把他帽子压下去蒙住了眼睛。

可怜的老人被这下出其不意的攻击骇呆了，半晌不动。克利斯朵夫以为他已经喝过汤，拿走了他的汤盆。等到高老头掀起帽子，拿汤匙往身边掏的时候，一下碰到了桌子，引得众人哄堂大笑。

“先生，”老头儿说，“你真缺德，要是你敢再来捺我帽子的话……”

“那么老头儿，怎么样？”伏脱冷截住了他的话。

“那么，你总有一天要受大大的报应……”

“进地狱是不是？”画家问，“还是进那个关坏孩子的黑房？”

“喂，小姐，”伏脱冷招呼维多莉，“你怎么不吃东西？爸爸还是不肯让步吗？”

“简直是魔王。”古的太太说。

“总得要他讲个理才好。”伏脱冷说。

“可是，”跟皮安训坐得很近的欧也纳插嘴，“小姐大可为吃饭问题告一状，因为她不吃东西。嗨！嗨！你们瞧高老头打量维多莉小姐的神气。”

老人忘了吃饭，只顾端详可怜的女孩子；她脸上显出真正的痛苦，一个横遭遗弃的孝女的痛苦。

“好朋友，”欧也纳低声对皮安训说，“咱们把高老头看错了。他既不是一个蠢货，也不是毫无生气的人。拿你的骨相学来试一试吧，再告诉我你的意见。昨夜我看见他扭一个镀金盘子，像蜡做的一样轻便；此刻他脸上的神气表示他颇有点了不起的感情。我觉得他的生活太神秘了，值得研究一下。你别笑，皮安训，我说的是正经话。”

“不消说，”皮安训回答，“用医学的眼光看，这家伙是有格局的；我可以把他解剖，只要他愿意。”

“不，只要你量一量他的脑壳。”

“行，就怕他的傻气会传染。”

两处访问


第二天，拉斯蒂涅穿得非常漂亮，下午三点光景出发到特·雷斯多太太家去了，一路上痴心妄想，希望无穷。因为有这种希望，青年人的生活才那么兴奋、激动。他们不考虑阻碍与危险，到处只看见成功；单凭幻想，把自己的生活变作一首诗；计划受到打击，他们便伤心苦恼，其实那些计划只不过是空中楼阁，漫无限制的野心。要不是他们无知，胆小，社会的秩序也没法维持了。欧也纳担着一百二十分的心，提防街上的泥土，一边走一边盘算跟特·雷斯多太太说些什么话，准备好他的聪明才智，想好一番敏捷的对答，端整了一套巧妙的措辞，像泰勒朗式[1]警辟的句子，以便遇到求爱的机会拿来应用，而能有求爱的机会就能建筑他的前程。不幸大学生还是被泥土沾污了，只能在王宫市场叫人上鞋油，刷裤子。他把以防万一的一枚银币找换时想道：

“我要是有钱，就可以坐在车上，舒舒服服地思索了。”

他终于到了海尔特街，向门上说要见特·雷斯多伯爵夫人。人家看他走过院子，大门外没有车马的声音，便轻蔑地瞧了他一眼；他存着终有一朝扬眉吐气的心，咬咬牙齿忍受了。院中停着一辆华丽的两轮车，披挂齐整的马在那儿跺脚。他看了挥金如土的奢华，暗示巴黎享乐生活的场面，已经自惭形秽，再加下人们的白眼，自然更难堪了。他马上心绪恶劣。满以为心窍大开、才思涌发的头脑，忽然闭塞了，神志也不清了。当差进去通报，欧也纳站在穿堂内一扇窗下，提着一只脚，肘子搁在窗子的拉手上，茫然望着窗外的院子。他觉得等了很久；要不是他有南方人的固执脾气，坚持下去会产生奇迹的那股劲儿，他早已跑掉了。

“先生，”当差出来说，“太太在上房里忙得很，没有给我回音；请先生到客厅里去等一会，已经有客在那里了。”

仆役能在一言半语之间批判主人或非难主人，拉斯蒂涅一边暗暗佩服这种可怕的本领，一边胸有成竹，推开当差走出来的门，想教那般豪仆看看他是认得府里的人物的，不料他莽莽撞撞走进一间摆油灯、酒架、烘干浴巾的器具的屋子，屋子通到一条黑洞洞的走廊和一座暗梯。他听到下人们在穿堂里匿笑，更慌了手脚。

“先生，客厅在这儿。”当差那种假装的恭敬似乎多加了一点讽刺的意味。

欧也纳性急慌忙退出来，撞在浴缸上，幸而帽子抓在手中，不曾掉在缸里。长廊尽头亮着一盏小灯，那边忽然开出一扇门，拉斯蒂涅听见特·雷斯多太太和高老头的声音，还带着一声亲吻。他跟着当差穿过饭厅，走进第一间客厅，发现一扇面临院子的窗，便去站在那儿。他想看看清楚，这个高老头是否真是他的高老头。他心跳得厉害，又想起伏脱冷那番可怕的议论。当差还在第二客室门口等他，忽然里面走出一个漂亮青年，不耐烦地说：

“我走了，莫利斯。告诉伯爵夫人，说我等了半个多钟点。”

这个放肆的男人——当然有他放肆的权利喽——哼着一支意大利歌曲的花腔，往欧也纳这边的窗子走过来，为了端详生客，也为了眺望院子。

“爵爷还是再等一会吧，太太事情已经完了。”莫利斯退往穿堂时说。

这时高老头从小扶梯的出口，靠近大门那边出现了。他提起雨伞准备撑开，没有注意大门开处，一个戴勋章的青年赶着一辆轻便马车直冲进来。高老头赶紧倒退一步，险些儿给撞翻。马被雨伞的绸盖吓了一下，向阶沿冲过去的时候，微微望斜刺里歪了一些。青年人怒气冲冲地回过头来，瞧了瞧高老头，在他没有出大门之前，对他点点头；那种礼貌就像对付一个有时要去求教的债主，又像对付一个不得不表敬意，而一转背就要为之脸红的下流坯。高老头亲热地答礼，好似很高兴。这些小节目都在一眨眼之间过去了。欧也纳全神贯注地瞧着，不觉得身边还有旁人，忽然听见伯爵夫人含嗔带怨的声音：

“嗳，玛克辛，你走啦？”伯爵夫人也没留意到楼下有车子进来。拉斯蒂涅转过身子，瞧见她娇滴滴地穿着件白开司棉外扣粉红结的梳妆衣，头上随便绾着一个髻，正是巴黎妇女的晨装。她身上发出一阵阵的香味，两眼水汪汪的，大概才洗过澡；经过一番调理，她愈加娇艳了。年轻人是把什么都看在眼里的，他们的精神是和女人的光彩融成一片的，好似植物在空气中吸取养料一般。欧也纳无须接触，已经感觉到这位太太的手鲜嫩无比；微微敞开的梳妆衣有时露出一点儿粉红的胸脯，他的眼睛就在这上面打转。伯爵夫人用不到鲸鱼骨绑腰，一根带子就表现出柔软的腰肢；她的脖子教人疼爱，套着软底鞋的脚非常好看。玛克辛捧着她的手亲吻，欧也纳才瞧见了玛克辛，伯爵夫人才瞧见了欧也纳。

“啊！是你，拉斯蒂涅先生，我很高兴看到你。”她说话时那副神气，聪明人看了马上会服从的。

玛克辛望望欧也纳，又望望伯爵夫人，那态度分明是叫不识趣的生客走开。——“喂，亲爱的，把这小子打发掉吧。”傲慢无礼的玛克辛的眼神，等于这句简单明了的话。伯爵夫人窥探玛克辛的脸色，唯命是听的表情无意中泄露了一个女人的全部心事。

拉斯蒂涅心里恨死了这个青年。先是玛克辛一头烫得很好的金黄头发，使他觉得自己的头发多么难看。其次，玛克辛的靴子又讲究又干净，不像他的沾了一层薄泥，虽然走路极其小心。最后，玛克辛穿着一件紧贴腰肢的外氅，像一个美丽的女人；欧也纳却在下午两点半已经穿上黑衣服了。从夏朗德州来的聪明的孩子，当然觉得这个高大细挑、淡眼睛、白皮肤的花花公子，会引诱没有父母的子弟倾家的人，靠了衣着占着上风。特·雷斯多太太不等欧也纳回答，便飞鸟似的走进另外一间客厅，衣裾招展，像一只蝴蝶。玛克辛跟着她，愤火中烧的欧也纳跟着玛克辛和伯爵夫人。在大客厅中间，和壁炉架离开几尺远的地方，三个人又碰在一块儿了。大学生明知要妨碍那讨厌的玛克辛，却顾不得特·雷斯多太太会不会生气，存心要跟这花花公子捣乱。他忽然记起在特·鲍赛昂太太的舞会里见过这青年，猜到他同伯爵夫人的关系。他凭着那种不是闯祸便是成功的少年人的胆气，私忖道：“这是我的情敌，非打倒不可。”

啊！这冒失鬼！他不知道这位玛克辛·特·脱拉伊伯爵专门挑拨人家侮辱他，然后先下手为强，一枪把敌人打死。欧也纳虽是打猎的能手，但靶子棚里二十二个木人，还不能打倒二十个。

年轻的伯爵往壁炉旁边的长椅里倒下身子，拿起火钳，把柴火乱搅一阵，动作那么粗暴，那么烦躁，把阿娜斯大齐那张好看的脸马上变得难看了。她转身向着欧也纳，冷冷地带着质问意味瞪了他一眼，意思是说：“干吗你还不走？”那在有教养的人是会立刻当作逐客令的。

欧也纳赔着笑脸，说道：“太太，我急于要拜见你，是为了……”

他突然停住，客厅的门开了。那位赶轻便马车的先生忽然出现，光着头，也不招呼伯爵夫人，只是不大放心地瞧瞧欧也纳，跟玛克辛握了握手，说了声“你好”，语气的亲热弄得欧也纳莫名其妙。外省青年完全不知道三角式的生活多么有意思。

伯爵夫人指着她的丈夫对大学生说：“这是特·雷斯多先生。”

欧也纳深深鞠了一躬。

“这一位，”她把欧也纳介绍给伯爵，“是特·拉斯蒂涅先生，因玛西阿家的关系，跟特·鲍赛昂太太是亲戚，我在她家上次的舞会里认识的。”

因玛西阿家的关系，跟特·鲍赛昂太太是亲戚，伯爵夫人因为要显出主妇的高傲，表示她府上的宾客没有一个无名小卒，而说得特别着重的两句话，发生了奇妙的作用，伯爵立刻放下那副冷淡的矜持的神气，招呼大学生道：

“久仰久仰。”

连玛克辛·特·脱拉伊伯爵也不安地瞧了瞧欧也纳，不像先前那么目中无人了。一个姓氏的力量竟像魔术棒一样，不但周围的人为之改容，便是大学生自己也头脑清醒，早先预备好的聪明机变都恢复过来了。巴黎上流社会的气氛对他原是漆黑一团，如今他灵机一动，忽然看清楚了。什么伏盖公寓，什么高老头，早已给忘得干干净净。

“我以为玛西阿一族已经没有人了。”特·雷斯多伯爵对欧也纳说。

“是的，先生。先伯祖特·拉斯蒂涅骑士，娶的是玛西阿家最后一位小姐。他们只生一个女儿，嫁给特·格拉朗蒲元帅，便是特·鲍赛昂太太的外祖父。我们一支是小房，先伯祖是海军中将，因为尽忠王事，把什么都丢了，就此家道中落。革命政府清算东印度公司的时候，竟不承认我们股东的权利。”

“令伯祖是不是在一七八九年前带领报复号的？”

“正是。”

“那么他该认得先祖了。当时先祖是伏维克号的舰长。”

玛克辛对特·雷斯多太太微微耸了耸肩膀，仿佛说：“倘使他跟这家伙大谈海军，咱们可完啦。”阿娜斯大齐懂得这意思，拿出女人的看家本领，对他笑着说：

“你来，玛克辛，我有事请教你。你们两位尽管驾着伏维克号和报复号并排儿出海吧。”说罢她站起身子，向玛克辛做了个俏皮的暗号，玛克辛便跟着她往上房走去。这蹊跷的一对刚走到门口，伯爵忽然打断了跟欧也纳的谈话，很不高兴地叫道：

“阿娜斯大齐，你别走。你明明知道……”

“我就来，我就来，”她抢着回答，“我托玛克辛的事，一下子就说完的。”

她很快地回来了。凡是要自由行动的女子都不能不看准丈夫的性格，知道做到哪一步还不至于丧失丈夫的信任，也从来不在小事情上闹别扭。就跟这些女子一样，伯爵夫人一听丈夫的声音，知道这时候不能太太平平在内客室耽下去。而这番挫折的确是从欧也纳来的。因此伯爵夫人恨恨地对玛克辛指着大学生。玛克辛含讥带讽向伯爵夫妇和欧也纳说：

“嗳，你们谈正经，我不打搅了；再见吧。”说完他走了。

“别走啊，玛克辛！”伯爵嚷道。

“回头来吃饭吧。”伯爵夫人丢下欧也纳和伯爵，跟着玛克辛走进第一客室，耽搁了半晌，以为伯爵可能打发欧也纳走的。

拉斯蒂涅听见他们俩一忽儿笑，一忽儿谈话，一忽儿寂静无声，便在伯爵面前卖弄才华，或是恭维他，或是逗他高谈阔论，有心拖延时间，好再见伯爵夫人，弄清她同高老头的关系。欧也纳怎么都想不过来，这个爱上玛克辛而能摆布丈夫的女子，怎么会同老面条商来往。他想摸清底细，拿到一点儿把柄去控制这个标准的巴黎女人。

“阿娜斯大齐！”伯爵又叫起太太来了。

“算了吧，可怜的玛克辛，”她对那青年说，“没有法儿了，晚上见……”

“希望你，娜齐，”他咬着她耳朵，“把这小子打发掉。你梳妆衣敞开一下，他眼睛就红得像一团火；他会对你谈情说爱，连累你，临了教我不得不打死他。”

“你疯了吗，玛克辛？这些大学生可不是挺好的避雷针吗？当然我会教特·雷斯多对他头痛的。”

玛克辛大声笑着出去了，伯爵夫人靠着窗口看他上车，拉起缰绳，扬起鞭子，直到大门关上了她才回来。

“喂，亲爱的，”伯爵对她说，“这位先生家里的庄园就在夏朗德河上，离凡端伊不远。他的伯祖还认得我的祖父呢。”

“好极了，大家都是熟人。”伯爵夫人心不在焉地回答。

“还不止这一点呢。”欧也纳低声说。

“怎么？”她不耐烦地问。

“刚才我看见从这儿出去一位先生，和我住在一所公寓里，而且是隔壁房间，高里奥老头……”

一听到老头这个俏皮字儿，正在拨火的伯爵好似烫了手，把钳子往火里一扔，站起身子说：

“先生，你可以称呼一声高里奥先生吧！”

看见丈夫烦躁，伯爵夫人脸上白一阵红一阵，狼狈不堪。她强作镇静，极力装着自然的声音说：“怎么会认识一个我们最敬爱的……”她顿住了，瞧着钢琴，仿佛心血来潮想起了什么，说道：“你喜欢音乐吗，先生？”

“喜欢得很。”欧也纳脸色通红，心慌意乱，迷迷糊糊地觉得自己闯了祸。

“你会唱歌吗？”她说着，走到钢琴前面，使劲按着所有的键子，从最低音的do到最高音的fa，啦啦啦的响成一片。

“不会，太太。”

伯爵在屋里踱来踱去。

“可惜！不会唱歌在交际场中就少了一件本领。——Ca-a-ro，Ca-a-ro，Ca-a-a-a-ro，non dubita-re。”[2]伯爵夫人唱着。

欧也纳说出高老头的名字，也等于挥动了一下魔术棒，同那一句“跟特·鲍赛昂太太是亲戚”的魔术棒，作用正相反。他好比走进一个收藏家的屋子，靠了有力的介绍才得进门，不料粗心大意撞了一下摆满小雕像的古董橱，把三四个不曾十分粘牢的头撞翻了。他恨不得钻入地下。特·雷斯多太太冷冷地板着脸，神情淡漠的眼睛故意躲开闯祸的大学生。

大学生道：“太太，你和特·雷斯多先生有事，请接受我的敬意，允许我……”

伯爵夫人赶紧做一个手势打断了欧也纳：“以后你每次光临我们总是挺欢迎的。”

欧也纳对主人夫妇深深地行了礼，虽然再三辞谢，还是被特·雷斯多先生一直送到穿堂。

“以后这位先生来，再不许通报！”伯爵吩咐莫利斯。

欧也纳跨下石级，发觉在下雨了。

“哼！”他心里想，“我跑来闹了一个笑话，既不知道原因，也不知范围；除此以外还得糟蹋我的衣服帽子。真应该乖乖地啃我的法律，一心一意做个严厉的法官。要体体面面地到交际场中混，先得办起两轮马车，雪亮的靴子，必不可少的行头，金链条，从早起就戴上六法郎一副的麂皮手套，晚上又是黄手套，我够得上这个资格吗？混账的高老头，去你的吧！”

走到大门口，一个马夫赶着一辆出租马车，大概才送了新婚夫妇回家，正想瞒着老板找几个外快；看见欧也纳没有雨伞，穿着黑衣服、白背心，又是白手套、上过油的靴子，便向他招招手。欧也纳憋着一肚子无名火，只想往已经掉下去的窟窿里钻，仿佛可以找到幸运的出路似的。他对马夫点点头，也不管袋里只剩一法郎零两个铜子，径自上了车。车厢里零零落落散着橘花和扎花的铜丝，证明新郎新娘才离开不久。

“先生上哪儿去呢？”车夫问。他已经脱下白手套。[3]

欧也纳私下想：“管他！既然花了钱，至少得利用一下！”便高声回答：“鲍赛昂府。”

“哪一个鲍赛昂府？”

一句话把欧也纳问住了。初出茅庐的漂亮哥儿不知道有两个鲍赛昂府，也不知道把他置之脑后的亲戚有那么多。

“特·鲍赛昂子爵，在……”

“葛勒南街，”马夫侧了侧脑袋，接口说，“你知道，还有特·鲍赛昂伯爵和侯爵的府第，在圣·陶米尼葛街。”他一边吊起踏脚，一边补充。

“我知道。”欧也纳沉着脸回答。他把帽子往前座的垫子上一丢，想道：“今天大家都拿我打哈哈！吓……这次胡闹一下把我的钱弄光了。可是至少，我有了十足的贵族排场去拜访我那所谓的表姊了。高老头起码花了我十法郎，这老浑蛋！真的，我要把今天的倒霉事儿告诉特·鲍赛昂太太，说不定会引她发笑呢。这老东西同那漂亮女人的该死的关系，她一定知道。与其碰那无耻女人的钉子——恐怕还得花一大笔钱——还不如去讨好我表姊。子爵夫人的姓名已经有那样的威力，她本人的权势更可想而知。还是走上面的门路吧。一个人想打天堂的主意，就该看准上帝下手！”

他思潮起伏，不知转着多少念头，上面的话只是一个简单的提纲。他望着雨景，镇静了些，胆气也恢复了些。他自忖虽然花掉了本月份仅存的十法郎，衣服鞋帽究竟保住了。一听马夫喊了声：“对不住，开门哪！”他不由得大为得意。金镶边大红制服的门丁，把大门拉得咕咕的直叫，拉斯蒂涅心满意足，眼看车子穿过门洞，绕进院子，在阶前玻璃棚下停住。马夫穿着大红绲边的蓝大褂，放下踏脚。欧也纳下车听见游廊里一阵匿笑。三四名当差在那里笑这辆恶俗的喜事车子。他们的笑声提醒了大学生，因为眼前就有现成的车马好比较。院中有一辆巴黎最华丽的轿车，套着两匹精壮的牲口，耳边插着蔷薇花，咬着嚼子，马夫头发扑着粉，打着领带，拉着缰绳，好像怕牲口逃走似的。唐打区的雷斯多太太府上，停着一个二十六岁男子的轻巧两轮车，圣·日耳曼区又摆着一位爵爷的煊赫的仪仗，一副三万法郎还办不起来的车马。

“又是谁在这儿呢？该死！表姊一定也有她的玛克辛！”欧也纳到这时才明白，巴黎难得碰到没有主顾的女人，纵然流着血汗也征服不了那样一个王后。

他跨上台阶，心已经凉了一半。玻璃门迎着他打开了；那些当差都一本正经，像挨过一顿痛打的骡子。他上次参加的跳舞会，是在楼下大厅内举行的。在接到请柬和舞会之间，他来不及拜访表姊，所以不曾进入特·鲍赛昂太太的上房，今天还是第一遭瞻仰到那些精雅绝伦、别出心裁的布置；一个杰出的女子的心灵和生活习惯，都可以在布置上面看出来。有了特·雷斯多太太的客厅做比较，对鲍府的研究也就更有意思。下午四点半，子爵夫人可以见客了。再早五分钟，她就不会招待表弟。完全不懂巴黎规矩的欧也纳，走上一座金漆栏杆，大红毯子，两旁供满鲜花的大楼梯，进入特·鲍赛昂太太的上房；至于她的小史，巴黎交际场中交头接耳说得一天一个样子的许多故事之中的一页，他可完全不知道。

三年以来，子爵夫人和葡萄牙一个最有名最有钱的贵族，特·阿瞿达—宾多侯爵有来往。那种天真无邪的交情，对当事人真是兴味浓厚，受不了第三者打扰。特·鲍赛昂子爵本人也以身作则，不管心里如何，面上总尊重这蹊跷的友谊。在他们订交的初期，凡是下午两点来拜访子爵夫人的宾客，总碰到特·阿瞿达—宾多侯爵在座。特·鲍赛昂太太为了体统关系，不能闭门谢客，可是对一般的来客十分冷淡，目不转睛地老瞧着墙壁上面的嵌线，结果大家都懂得她在那里受罪。直到巴黎城中知道了两点至四点之间的访问要打搅特·鲍赛昂太太，她才得到清静。她上意大利剧院或者歌剧院，必定由特·鲍赛昂和特·阿瞿达—宾多两位先生陪着；老于世故的特·鲍赛昂先生把太太和葡萄牙人安顿停当之后，就托故走开。最近特·阿瞿达先生要同洛希斐特家的一位小姐结婚了，整个上流社会中只剩特·鲍赛昂太太一个人不曾知道。有几个女朋友向她隐隐约约提过几次；她只是打哈哈，以为朋友们妒忌她的幸福，想破坏。可是教堂的婚约公告[4]马上就得颁布。这位葡萄牙美男子，那天特意来想对子爵夫人宣布婚事，却始终不敢吐出一个负心字儿。为什么？因为天下的难事莫过于对一个女子下这么一个哀的美敦。有些男人觉得在决斗场上给人拿着剑直指胸脯倒还好受，不像一个哭哭啼啼了两小时，再晕过去要人施救的女子难于应付。那时特·阿瞿达侯爵如坐针毡，一心要溜，打算回去写信来告诉她；男女之间一刀两断的手续，书面总比口头好办。听见当差通报欧也纳·特·拉斯蒂涅先生来了，特·阿瞿达侯爵快乐得直跳。一个真有爱情的女人猜疑起来，比寻欢作乐、更换口味还要心思灵巧。一朝到了被遗弃的关头，她对于一个姿势的意义，能够一猜就中，连马在春天的空气中嗅到刺激爱情的气息，也没有那么快。特·鲍赛昂太太一眼就觑破了那个不由自主的表情，微妙的，可是天真得可怕的表情。

欧也纳不知道在巴黎不论拜访什么人，必须先到主人的亲友那里，把丈夫的，妻子的，或儿女的历史打听明白，免得闹出笑话来，要像波兰俗语所说的，把五头牛套上你的车！就是说直要九牛二虎之力，才能拔出你的泥脚。在谈话中出乱子，在法国还没有名称，大概因为谣言非常普遍，大家认为不会再发生冒失的事。在特·雷斯多家闹了乱子以后——主人也不给他时间把五头牛套上车——也只有欧也纳才会莽莽撞撞闯进鲍赛昂家再去闯祸。所不同的是，他在前者家里教特·雷斯多太太和特·脱拉伊先生发窘，在这儿却是替特·阿瞿达解了围。

一间小巧玲珑的客室，只有灰和粉红两种颜色，陈设精美而没有一点富贵气。欧也纳一进客室，葡萄牙人便向特·鲍赛昂太太说了声“再会”，急急地抢着往门边走。

“那么晚上见，”特·鲍赛昂太太回头向侯爵望了一眼，“我们不是要上意大利剧院吗？”

“不能奉陪了。”他的手已经抓着门钮。

特·鲍赛昂太太站起身子，叫他走回来，根本没有注意欧也纳。欧也纳站在那儿，给华丽的排场弄得迷迷糊糊，以为进了天方夜谭的世界；他面对着这个连瞧也不瞧他的太太，不知道怎么办。子爵夫人举起右手食指做了个美妙的动作，指着面前的地位要侯爵站过来。这姿态有股热情的威势，侯爵不得不放下门钮走回来。欧也纳望着他，心里非常羡慕。

他私下想：“这便是轿车中的人物！哼！竟要骏马前驱，健仆后随，挥金如流水，才能博得巴黎女子的青睐吗？”奢侈的欲望像魔鬼般咬着他的心，攫取财富的狂热煽动他的头脑，黄金的饥渴使他喉干舌燥。他每季有一百三十法郎生活费；而父亲、母亲、兄弟、妹妹、姑母，统共每月花不到两百法郎。他把自己的境况和理想中的目标很快地比较了一下，心里愈加发慌了。

“为什么你不能上意大利剧院呢？”子爵夫人笑着问。

“为了正经事！今晚英国大使馆请客。”

“你可以先走一步啊。”

一个男人一开始欺骗，必然会接二连三地扯谎。特·阿瞿达先生笑着说：“你非要我先走不可吗？”

“当然。”

“嗳，我就是要你说这一句呀。”他回答时那种媚眼，换了别的女人都会被他骗过的。

他抓起子爵夫人的手亲了一下，走了。

欧也纳用手掠了掠头发，弓着身子预备行礼，以为特·鲍赛昂太太这一下总该想到他了。不料她身子往前一扑，冲入回廊，跑到窗前瞧特·阿瞿达先生上车；她侧耳留神，只听见跟班的小厮传令给马夫道：“上洛希斐特公馆。”

这几个字，加上特·阿瞿达坐在车厢里如释重负的神气，对子爵夫人不啻闪电和雷击。她回身进来，心惊肉跳。上流社会中最可怕的祸事就是这个。她走进卧室，坐下来拈起一张美丽的信纸，写道：

“只要你在洛希斐特家吃饭而不是在英国使馆，你非和我解释清楚不可。我等着你。”

有几个字母因为手指发抖而写走了样，她改了改，签上一个C字，那是她的姓名格兰·特·蒲尔高涅的缩写。然后她打铃叫人。

“雅各，”她咐吩当差，“你七点半上洛希斐特公馆去见特·阿瞿达侯爵。他在的话，把这条子交给他，不用等回音；要是不在，原信带回。”

“太太，客厅里还有人等着。”

“啊，不错！”她说完推门进去。

欧也纳已经觉得很不自在，终于瞧见子爵夫人的时候，她情绪激动的语气又搅乱了他的心。她说：

“对不起，先生，我刚才要写个字条，现在可以奉陪了。”

其实她自己也不知道说些什么，她心里正想着：“啊！他要娶洛希斐特小姐。可是他身子自由吗？今晚上这件亲事就得毁掉，否则我……噢！事情明天就解决了，急什么！”

“表姊……”欧也纳才叫了一声。

“唔？”子爵夫人傲慢的目光教大学生打了一个寒噤。

欧也纳懂得了这个“唔”。三小时以来他长了多少见识；一听见这一声，马上警惕起来，红着脸改口道：“太太。”他犹豫了一会又说：“请原谅，我真需要人家提拔，便是拉上一点儿远亲的关系也有用处。”

特·鲍赛昂太太微微一笑，笑得很凄凉：她已经感觉到在她周围酝酿的厄运。

“如果你知道我家庭的处境，”他接着说，“你一定乐意做神话中的仙女，替孩子们打破难关。”

她笑道：“哦，表弟，要我怎样帮忙呢？”

“我也说不上。恢复我们久已疏远的亲戚关系，在我已经是大大的幸运了。你使我心慌意乱，简直不知道我刚才说了些什么。我在巴黎只认识你一个人。噢！我要向你请教，求你当我是个可怜的孩子，愿意绕在你裙下，为你出生入死。”

“你能为我杀人么？”

“杀两个都可以。”欧也纳回答。

“孩子！真的，你是个孩子，”她咽住了眼泪，“你才会真诚地爱，你！”

“噢！”他甩了甩脑袋。

子爵夫人听了大学生这句野心勃勃的回答，不禁对他大为关切。这是南方青年第一次用心计。在特·雷斯多太太的蓝客厅和特·鲍赛昂太太的粉红客厅之间，他读完了三年的巴黎法。这部法典虽则没有人提过，却构成一部高等社会判例，一朝学成而善于运用的话，无论什么目的都可以达到。

“噢！我要说的话想起来了，在你的舞会里我认识了特·雷斯多太太，我刚才看了她来着。”

“那你大大地打搅她了。”特·鲍赛昂太太笑着说。

“唉！是呀，我一窍不通，你要不帮忙，我会教所有的人跟我作对。我看，在巴黎极难碰到一个年轻、美貌、有钱、风雅而又没有主顾的女子；我需要这样一位女子，把你们解释得多么巧妙的人生开导我；而到处都有一个脱拉伊先生。我这番来向你请教一个谜的谜底，求你告诉我，我所闹的乱子究竟是什么性质。我在那边提起了一个老头儿……”

“特·朗日公爵夫人来了。”雅各进来通报，打断了大学生的话，大学生做了一个大为气恼的姿势。

“你要想成功，”子爵夫人低声嘱咐他，“第一先不要这样富于表情。”

“喂！你好，亲爱的。”她起身迎接公爵夫人，握着她的手，感情洋溢，便是对亲姊妹也不过如此。公爵夫人也做出种种亲热的样子。

“这不是一对好朋友吗？”拉斯蒂涅心里想，“从此我可以有两个保护人了；这两位想必口味相仿，表姊关切我，这客人一定也会关切我的。”

“你真好，想到来看我，亲爱的安多纳德！”特·鲍赛昂太太说。

“我看见特·阿瞿达先生进了洛希斐特公馆，便想到你是一个人在家了。”

公爵夫人说出这些不祥的话，特·鲍赛昂太太既不咬嘴唇，也不脸红，而是目光镇静，额角反倒开朗起来。

“要是我知道你有客……”公爵夫人转身望着欧也纳，补上一句。

子爵夫人说：“这位是我的表弟欧也纳·特·拉斯蒂涅先生。你有没有蒙脱里伏将军的消息？昨天赛里齐告诉我，大家都看不见他了，今天他到过府上没有？”

大家知道公爵夫人热恋特·蒙脱里伏先生，最近被遗弃了；她听了这句问话十分刺心，红着脸回答：

“昨天他在爱丽舍宫。”

“值班吗？[5]”特·鲍赛昂太太问。

“格拉拉，你想必知道，”公爵夫人放出狡狯的目光，“特·阿瞿达先生和洛希斐特小姐的婚约，明天就要由教堂公布了？”

这个打击可太凶了，子爵夫人不禁脸色发白，笑着回答：

“哦，又是那些傻瓜造的谣言。干吗特·阿瞿达先生要把葡萄牙一个最美的姓送给洛希斐特呢？洛希斐特家封爵还不过是昨天的事。”

“可是人家说贝尔德有二十万法郎利息的陪嫁呢。”

“特·阿瞿达先生是大富翁，决不会存这种心思。”

“可是，亲爱的，洛希斐特小姐着实可爱呢。”

“是吗？”

“还有，他今天在那边吃饭，婚约的条件已经谈妥；你消息这样不灵，好不奇怪！”

“哎，你究竟闹了什么乱子呢，先生？”特·鲍赛昂太太转过话头说。“这可怜的孩子刚踏进社会，我们才说的话，他一句也不懂。亲爱的安多纳德，请你照应照应他。我们的事，明儿再谈，明儿一切都正式揭晓，你要帮我忙也更有把握了。”

公爵夫人傲慢地瞧了欧也纳一眼，那种眼风能把一个人从头到脚瞧尽，把他缩小，化为乌有。

“太太，我无意之间得罪了特·雷斯多太太。无意之间这四个字便是我的罪名。”大学生灵机一动，发觉眼前两位太太亲切的谈话藏着狠毒的讽刺，他接着说：“对那些故意伤害你们的人，你们会照常接见，说不定还怕他们；一个伤了人而不知伤到什么程度的家伙，你们当他是傻瓜，当他是什么都不会利用的笨蛋，谁都瞧不起他。”

特·鲍赛昂太太眼睛水汪汪地瞟了他一下。伟大的心灵往往用这种眼光表示他们的感激和尊严。刚才公爵夫人用拍卖行估价员式的眼风打量欧也纳，伤了他的心，现在特·鲍赛昂太太的眼神在他的伤口上涂了止痛的油膏。

欧也纳接着说：“你们才想不到呢，我才博得了特·雷斯多伯爵的欢心，因为，”他又谦恭又狡狯地转向公爵夫人，“不瞒你说，太太，我还不过是个可怜的大学生，又穷又孤独……”

“别说这个话，先生。哭诉是谁都不爱听的，我们女人又何尝爱听。”

“好吧！我只有二十二岁，应当忍受这个年纪上的苦难，何况我现在正在忏悔；哪里还有比这儿更美丽的忏悔室呢？我们在教士前面忏悔的罪孽，就是在这儿犯的。”

公爵夫人听了这段亵渎宗教的议论，把脸一沉，很想把这种粗俗的谈吐指斥一番，她对子爵夫人说：“这位先生才……”

特·鲍赛昂太太觉得表弟和公爵夫人都很好笑，也就老实不客气笑了出来。

“对啦，他才到巴黎来，正在找一个女教师，教他懂得一点儿风雅。”

“公爵夫人，”欧也纳接着说，“我们想找门路，把所爱的对象摸清根底，不是挺自然的吗？”（呸！他心里想，这几句话简直像理发匠说的。）

公爵夫人说：“我想特·雷斯多太太是特·脱拉伊先生的女弟子吧。”

大学生说：“我完全不知道，太太，因此糊里糊涂闯了进去，把他们岔开了。幸而我跟丈夫混得不坏，那位太太也还客气，直到我说出我认识一个刚从他们后楼梯下去，在一条甬道底上跟伯爵夫人拥抱的人。”

“谁呀？”两位太太同时问。

“住在圣·玛梭区的一个老头儿，像我这穷学生一样一个月只有四十法郎的生活费，被大家取笑的可怜虫，叫作高里奥老头。”

“哦呀！你这个孩子，”子爵夫人嚷道，“特·雷斯多太太便是高里奥家的小姐啊。”

“面条商的女儿，”公爵夫人接口说，“她跟一个糕饼师的女儿同一天入宫觐见。你不记得吗，格拉拉？王上笑开了，用拉丁文说了句关于面粉的妙语，说那些女子，怎么说的，那些女子……”

“其为面粉也无异。”欧也纳替她说了出来。

“对啦，”公爵夫人说。

“啊！原来是她的父亲。”大学生做了个不胜厌恶的姿势。

“可不是！这家伙有两个女儿，他都喜欢得要命，可是两个女儿差不多已经不认他了。”

“那小的一个，”子爵夫人望着特·朗日太太说，“不是嫁给一个姓名像德国人的银行家，叫作特·纽沁根男爵吗？她名字叫但斐纳，头发淡黄，在歌剧院有个侧面的包厢，也上喜剧院，常常高声大笑引人家注意，是不是？”

公爵夫人笑道：“嗳，亲爱的，真佩服你。干吗你对那些人这样留神呢？真要像特·雷斯多一样爱得发疯，才会跟阿娜斯大齐在面粉里打滚。嘿！他可没有学会生意经。他太太落在特·脱拉伊手里，早晚要倒霉的。”

“她们不认父亲！”欧也纳重复了一句。

“嗳！是啊，”子爵夫人接着说，“不承认她们的亲爸爸，好爸爸。听说他给了每个女儿五六十万，让她们攀一门好亲事，舒舒服服地过日子。他自己只留下八千到一万法郎的进款，以为女儿永远是女儿，一朝嫁了人，他等于有了两个家，可以受到敬重、奉承。哪知不到两年，两个女婿把他赶出他们的圈子，当他是个要不得的下流东西……”

欧也纳冒出几颗眼泪。他最近还在家中体味到骨肉之爱，天伦之乐；他还没有失掉青年人的信仰，而且在巴黎文明的战场上还是第一天登台。真实的感情是极有感染力的：三个人都一声不出，愣了一会。

“唉！天哪，”特·朗日太太说，“这一类的事真是该死，可是我们天天看得到。总该有个原因吧？告诉我，亲爱的，你有没有想过，什么叫女婿？——女婿是我们替他白养女儿的男人。我们把女儿当作心肝宝贝，抚养长大，我们和她有着成千成万的联系。十七岁以前，她是全家的快乐天使，像拉马丁所说的洁白的灵魂，然后变作家庭的瘟神。女婿从我们手里把她抢走，拿她的爱情当作一把刀，把我们的天使心中所有拴着娘家的感情，活生生地一齐斩断。昨天女儿还是我们的性命，我们也还是女儿的性命；明天她便变作我们的仇敌。这种悲剧不是天天有吗？这里，又是媳妇对那个为儿子牺牲一切的公公肆无忌惮；那里，又是女婿把丈母撵出门外。我听见人家都在问，今日社会里究竟有些什么惨剧；唉，且不说我们的婚姻都变成了糊涂婚姻；关于女婿的惨剧不是可怕到极点吗？我完全明白那老面条商的遭遇，记得这个福里奥……”

“是高里奥，太太。”

“是啊，这莫里奥在大革命时代当过他们分会主席；那次有名的饥荒，他完全知道底细；当时面粉的售价比进价高出十倍，他从此发了财。那时他囤足面粉；光是我祖母的总管就卖给他一大批。当然，高里奥像所有那些人一样，是跟公安委员会分肥的。我记得总管还安慰祖母，说她尽可以太太平平地住在葛朗维里哀，她的麦子就是一张出色的公民证。至于把麦子卖给刽子手们[6]的洛里奥，只有一桩痴情，就是溺爱女儿。他把大女儿高高地供在特·雷斯多家里，把老二接种接在特·纽沁根男爵身上，纽沁根是个加入保王党的有钱的银行家。你们明白，在帝政时代，两个女婿看到家里有个老革命党并不讨厌；既然是拿破仑当权，那还可以将就。可是波旁家复辟之后，那老头儿就教特·雷斯多先生头疼了，尤其那个银行家。两个女儿或许始终爱着父亲，想在父亲跟丈夫之间委曲求全；她们在没有外客的时候招待高里奥，想出种种借口表示她们的体贴。‘爸爸，你来呀。没有人打搅，我们舒服多了！’诸如此类的话。我相信，亲爱的，凡是真实的感情都有眼睛，都有聪明，所以那个大革命时代的可怜虫伤心死了。他看出女儿们觉得他丢了她们的脸；也看出要是她们爱丈夫，他却妨害了女婿，非牺牲不可。他便自己牺牲了，因为他是父亲，他自动退了出来。看到女儿因此高兴，他明白他做得很对。这小小的罪过实在是父女同谋的。我们到处都看到这种情形。在女儿的客厅里，陶里奥老头不是一个油脂的污迹吗？他在那儿感到拘束闷得发慌。这个父亲的遭遇，便是一个最美的女子对付一个最心爱的男人也能碰到，如果她的爱情使他厌烦，他会走开，做出种种卑鄙的事来躲开她。所有的感情都会落到这个田地的。我们的心是一座宝库，一下子倒空了，就会破产。一个人把情感统统拿了出来，就像把钱统统花光了一样得不到人家原谅。这个父亲把什么都给了。二十年间他给了他的心血，他的慈爱；又在一天之间给了他的财产。柠檬榨干了，那些女儿把剩下的皮扔在街上。”

“社会真卑鄙。”子爵夫人低着眼睛，拉着披肩上的经纬。特·朗日太太讲这个故事的时候，有些话刺了她的心。

“不是卑鄙！”公爵夫人回答，“社会就是那么一套。我这句话不过表示我看透了社会。实际我也跟你一般想法，”她紧紧握着子爵夫人的手，“社会是一个泥坑，我们得站在高地上。”

她起身亲了一下特·鲍赛昂太太的前额，说：

“亲爱的，你这一下真漂亮。血色好极了。”

然后她对欧也纳略微点点头，走了。

欧也纳想起那夜高老头扭绞镀金盘子的情形，说道：“高老头真伟大！”

特·鲍赛昂太太没有听见，她想得出神了。两人半天没有出声，可怜的大学生愣在那儿，既不敢走，又不敢留，也不敢开口。

“社会又卑鄙又残忍，”子爵夫人终于说，“只要我们碰到一桩灾难，总有一个朋友来告诉我们，拿把短刀掏我们的心窝，教我们欣赏刀柄。冷一句热一句，挖苦，奚落，一齐来了。啊！我可是要抵抗的。”她抬起头来，那种庄严的姿势恰好显出她贵妇人的身份，高傲的眼睛射出闪电似的光芒。——“啊！”她一眼瞧见了欧也纳，“你在这里！”

“是的，还没有走。”他不胜惶恐地回答。

“嗳，拉斯蒂涅先生，你得以牙还牙对付这个社会。你想成功吗？我帮你。你可以测量出来，女人堕落到什么田地，男人虚荣到什么田地。虽然人生这部书我已经读得烂熟，可是还有一些篇章不曾寓目。现在我全明白了。你越没有心肝，越高升得快。你得不留情地打击人家，叫人家怕你。只能把男男女女当作驿马，把它们骑得精疲力尽，到了站上丢下来；这样你就能达到欲望的最高峰。不是吗，你要没有一个女人关切，你在这儿便一文不值。这女人还得年轻，有钱，漂亮。倘使你有什么真情，必须像宝贝一样藏起，永远别给人家猜到，要不就完啦，你不但做不成刽子手，反过来要给人家开刀了。有朝一日你动了爱情，千万要守秘密！没有弄清楚对方的底细，决不能掏出你的心来。你现在还没有得到爱情；可是为保住将来的爱情，先得学会提防人家。听我说，米盖尔……（她不知不觉说错了名字）[7]女儿遗弃父亲，巴望父亲早死，还不算可怕呢。那两姊妹也彼此忌妒得厉害。雷斯多是旧家出身，他的太太进过宫了，贵族社会也承认她了；可是她的有钱的妹妹，美丽的但斐纳·特·纽沁根夫人，银行家太太，却难过死了；忌妒咬着她的心，她跟姊姊貌合神离，比路人还不如；姊姊已经不是她的姊姊；两个人你不认我，我不认你，正如不认她们的父亲一样。特·纽沁根太太只消能进我的客厅，便是把圣·拉查街到葛勒南街一路上的灰土舐个干净也是愿意的。她以为特·玛赛能够帮她达到这个目的，便甘心情愿做他奴隶，把他缠得头痛。哪知特·玛赛干脆不把她放在心上。你要能把她介绍到我这儿来，你便是她的心肝宝贝。以后你能爱她就爱她，要不就利用她一下也好。我可以接见她一两次，逢到盛大的晚会，宾客众多的时候；可是决不单独招待她。我看见她打个招呼就够了。你说出了高老头的名字，你把伯爵夫人家的大门关上了。是的，朋友，你尽管上雷斯多家二十次，她会二十次不在家。你被他们撵出门外了。好吧，你叫高老头替你介绍特·纽沁根太太吧。那位漂亮太太可以做你的幌子。一朝她把你另眼相看了，所有的女人都会一窝蜂地来追你。跟她竞争的对手，她的朋友，她的最知己的朋友，都想把你抢过去了。有些女人，只喜欢别的女子挑中的男人，好像那般资产阶级的妇女，以为戴上我们的帽子就有了我们的风度。所以那时你就能走红。在巴黎，走红就是万事亨通，就是拿到权势的宝钥。倘若女人觉得你有才气，有能耐，男人就会相信，只消你自己不露马脚。那时你多大的欲望都不成问题可以实现，你哪儿都走得进去。那时你会明白，社会不过是傻子跟骗子的集团。你别做傻子，也别做骗子。我把我的姓氏借给你，好比一根阿里安纳的线，引你进这座迷宫。[8]别把我的姓污辱了，”她扭了扭脖子，气概非凡地对大学生瞧了一眼，“清清白白地还给我。好，去吧，我不留你了。我们做女人的也有我们的仗要打。”

“要不要一个死心塌地的人替你去点炸药？”欧也纳打断了她的话。

“那又怎么样？”她问。

他拍拍胸脯，表姊对他笑了笑，他也笑了笑，走了。那时已经五点；他肚子饿了，只怕赶不上晚饭。这一担心，使他感到在巴黎平步青云，找到了门路的快乐。得意之下，他马上给自己的许多思想包围了。像他那种年龄的青年，一受委屈就会气得发疯，对整个社会抡着拳头，又想报复，又失掉了自信。拉斯蒂涅那时正为了你把伯爵夫人家的大门关上了那句话发急，心上想：“我要去试一试！如果特·鲍赛昂太太的话不错，如果我真的碰在门上，那么……哼！特·雷斯多夫人不论上哪一家的沙龙，都要碰到我。我要学击剑，放枪，把她的玛克辛打死！——可是钱呢？”他忽然问自己，“那儿去弄钱呢？”特·雷斯多伯爵夫人家里铺张的财富，忽然在眼前亮起来。他在那儿见到一个高里奥小姐心爱的奢华、金碧辉煌的屋子，显而易见的贵重器物，暴发户的恶俗排场，像人家的外室那样的浪费。这幅迷人的图画忽然又给鲍赛昂府上的大家气派压倒了。他的幻想飞进了巴黎的上层社会，马上冒出许多坏念头，扩大他的眼界和心胸。他看到了社会的本相：法律跟道德对有钱的人全无效力，财产才是金科玉律。他想：“伏脱冷说得不错，有财便是德！”

到了圣·日内维新街，他赶紧上楼拿十法郎付了车钱，走入气味难闻的饭厅；十八个食客好似马槽前的牲口一般正在吃饭。他觉得这副穷酸相跟饭厅的景象丑恶已极。环境转变得太突兀了，对比太强烈了，格外刺激他的野心。一方面是最高雅的社会的新鲜可爱的面目，个个人年轻，活泼，有诗意，有热情，四周又是美妙的艺术品和阔绰的排场；另一方面是溅满污泥的阴惨的画面，人物的脸上只有被情欲扫荡过的遗迹。特·鲍赛昂太太因为被人遗弃，一怒之下给他的指导和策划的计谋，他一下子都回想起来，而眼前的惨象又等于给那些话添上注解。拉斯蒂涅决意分两路进攻去猎取财富：依靠学问，同时依靠爱情，成为一个有学问的博士，同时做一个时髦人物。可笑他还幼稚得很，不知道这两条路线是永远连不到一起的。

“你神气忧郁得很，侯爵大人。”伏脱冷说。他的眼风似乎把别人心里最隐蔽的秘密都看得雪亮。

欧也纳答道：“我受不了这一类的玩笑，要在这儿真正当一个侯爵，应当有十万法郎进款；住伏盖公寓的就不是什么走运的人。”

伏脱冷瞧着拉斯蒂涅，倚老卖老而轻蔑的神气仿佛说：“小子！还不够我一口！”接着说：“你心绪不好，大概在漂亮的特·雷斯多太太那边没有得手。”

欧也纳道：“哼，因为我说出她父亲跟我们一桌子吃饭，她把我撵走了。”

饭桌上的人都面面相觑。高老头低下眼睛，掉转头去抹了一下。

“你把鼻烟撒在我眼里了。”他对邻座的人说。

“从今以后，谁再欺负高老头，就是欺负我。”欧也纳望着老面条商邻座的人说：“他比我们都强。当然我不说太太们。”他向泰伊番小姐补上一句。

这句话成为事情的转折点，欧也纳说话的神气使桌上的人不出声了。只有伏脱冷含讥带讽的回答：

“你要做高老头的后台，做他的经理，先得学会击剑跟放枪。”

“对啦，我就要这么办。”

“这么说来，你今天预备开场啰。”

“也许，”拉斯蒂涅回答，“不过谁都管不了我的事，既然我不想知道旁人黑夜里干些什么。”

伏脱冷斜着眼把拉斯蒂涅瞅了一下。

“老弟，要拆穿人家的把戏，就得走进戏棚子，不能在帐幔的缝子里张一张就算。别多说了，”他看见欧也纳快要发毛，补上一句，“你要愿意谈谈，我随时可以奉陪。”

饭桌上大家冷冰冰的，不作声了。高老头听了大学生那句话，非常难受，不知道众人对他的心理已经改变，也不知道一个有资格阻止旁人虐待他的青年，挺身而出做了他的保护人。

“高里奥先生真是一个伯爵夫人的父亲吗？”伏盖太太低声问。

“同时也是一个男爵夫人的父亲。”拉斯蒂涅回答。

“他只好当父亲的角色，”皮安训对拉斯蒂涅说，“我已经打量过他的脑袋：只有一根骨头，一根父骨，他大概是天父吧。”

欧也纳心事重重，听了皮安训的俏皮话不觉得好笑。他要遵从特·鲍赛昂太太的劝告，盘算从哪儿去弄钱，怎样去弄钱。社会这片大草原在他面前又空旷又稠密，他望着出神了。吃完晚饭，客人散尽，只剩他一个人在饭厅里。

“你竟看到我的女儿么？”高老头非常感动地问。

欧也纳惊醒过来，抓着老人的手，很亲热地瞧着他回答：

“你是一个好人，正派的人。咱们回头再谈你的女儿。”

他不愿再听高老头的话，躲到卧房里给母亲写信去了。





“亲爱的母亲，请你考虑一下，能不能再给我一次哺育之恩。我现在的情形可以很快地发迹；只是需要一千二百法郎，而且非要不可。对父亲一个字都不能提，也许他会反对，而如果我弄不到这笔钱，我将濒于绝望，以至自杀。我的用意将来当面告诉你，因为要你了解我目前的处境，简直要写上几本书才行。好妈妈，我没有赌钱，也没有欠债；可是你给我的生命，倘使你愿意保留的话，就得替我筹这笔款子。总而言之，我已见过特·鲍赛昂子爵夫人，她答应提拔我。我得应酬交际，可是没有钱买一副合适的手套。我能够只吃面包，只喝清水，必要时可以挨饿；但我不能缺少巴黎种葡萄的工具。将来是青云直上还是留在泥地里，都在此一举。你们对我的期望，我全知道，并且要快快地实现。好妈妈，卖掉一些旧首饰吧，不久我买新的给你。我很知道家中的境况，你的牺牲，我是心中有数的；你也该相信我不是无端端地教你牺牲，那我简直是禽兽了。我的请求是迫不得已。咱们的前程全靠这一次的接济，拿了这个，我将上阵开仗，因为巴黎的生活是一场永久的战争。倘使为凑足数目而不得不出卖姑母的花边，那么请告诉她，我将来有最好看的寄给她。”





他分别写信给两个妹妹，讨她们的私蓄，知道她们一定乐意给的。为了使她们在家里绝口不提，他故意挑拨青年人的好胜心，要她们懂得体贴。可是写完了这些信，他仍旧有点儿心惊肉跳，神魂不定。青年野心家知道像他妹妹那种与世隔绝、一尘不染的心灵多么高尚，知道自己这封信要给她们多少痛苦，同时也要给她们多少快乐；她们将怀着如何欢悦的心情，躲在庄园底里偷偷谈论她们疼爱的哥哥。他心中亮起一片光明，似乎看到她们私下数着小小的积蓄，看到她们卖弄少女的狡狯，为了好心而第一次玩弄手段，把这笔钱用匿名方式寄给他。他想：“一个姊妹的心纯洁无比，它的温情是没有穷尽的！”他写了那样的信，觉得惭愧。她们许起愿心来何等有力！求天拜地的冲动何等纯洁！有一个牺牲的机会，她们还不快乐死吗？如果他母亲不能凑足他所要的款子，她又要多么苦恼！这些至诚的感情，可怕的牺牲，将要成为他达到特·纽沁根太太面前的阶梯；想到这些，他不由得落下几滴眼泪，等于献给家庭神坛的最后几炷香。他心乱如麻，在屋子里乱转。高老头从半开的门里瞧见他这副模样，进来问他：

“先生，你怎么啦？”

“唉！我的邻居，我还没忘记做儿子做兄弟的本分，正如你始终当着父亲的责任。你真有理由替伯爵夫人着急，她落在玛克辛·特·脱拉伊手里，早晚要断送她的。”

高老头嘟囔着退了出来，欧也纳不曾听清他说些什么。

第二天，拉斯蒂涅把信送往邮局。他到最后一刻还犹疑不决，但终于把信丢进邮箱，对自己说：“我一定成功！”这是赌棍的口头禅，大将的口头禅，这种相信运气的话往往是致人死命而不是救人性命的。过了几天，他去看特·雷斯多太太，特·雷斯多太太不见。去了三次，三次挡驾，虽则他都候玛克辛不在的时间上门。子爵夫人料得不错。大学生不再用功念书，只上堂去应卯划到，过后便溜之大吉。多数大学生都要临到考试才用功，欧也纳把第二第三年的学程并在一起，预备到最后关头再一口气认认真真读他的法律。这样他可以有十五个月的空闲，好在巴黎的海洋中漂流，追求女人，或者捞一笔财产。

在那一星期内，他见了两次特·鲍赛昂太太，都是等特·阿瞿达侯爵的车子出门之后才去的。这位红极一时的女子，圣·日耳曼区最有诗意的人物，又得意了几天，把洛希斐特小姐和特·阿瞿达侯爵的婚事暂时搁浅。特·鲍赛昂太太深怕好景不长，在这最后几天中感情格外热烈；但就在这期间，她的祸事酝酿成熟了。特·阿瞿达侯爵跟洛希斐特家暗中同意，认为这一次的吵架与讲和大有好处，希望特·鲍赛昂太太对这头亲事思想上有个准备，希望特·鲍赛昂太太终于肯把每天下午的聚首为特·阿瞿达的前程牺牲，结婚不是男人一生中必经的阶段吗？所以特·阿瞿达虽然天天海誓山盟，实在是在做戏，而子爵夫人也甘心情愿受他蒙蔽。“她不愿从窗口里庄严地跳下去，宁可在楼梯上打滚。”她的最知己的朋友特·朗日公爵夫人这样说她。这些最后的微光照耀得相当长久，使子爵夫人还能留在巴黎，给年轻的表弟效劳——她对他的关切简直有点迷信，仿佛认为他能够带来好运。欧也纳对她表示非常忠心非常同情，而那是正当一个女人到处看不见怜悯和安慰的目光的时候。在这种情形之下，一个男人对女子说温柔的话，一定是别有用心。

拉斯蒂涅为了彻底看清形势，再去接近纽沁根家，想先把高老头从前的生活弄个明白。他搜集了一些确实的材料，可以归纳如下：

大革命之前，约翰—姚希姆·高里奥是一个普通的面条司务，熟练，省俭，相当有魄力，能够在东家在一七八九年第一次大暴动中遭劫以后，盘下铺子，开在于西安街，靠近麦子市场。他很识时务，居然肯当分会主席，使他的买卖得到那个危险时代一般有势力的人保护。这种聪明是他起家的根源。就在不知是真是假的大饥荒时代，巴黎粮食贵得惊人的那一时节里，他开始发财。那时民众在面包店前面拼命，而有些人照样太太平平向杂货商买到各式上等面食。

那一年，高里奥积了一笔资本，他以后做买卖也就像一切资力雄厚的人那样，处处占着上风。他的遭遇正是一切中等才具的遭遇。他的平庸占了便宜。并且直到有钱不再危险的时代，他的财富才揭晓，所以并没引起人家的妒羡。粮食的买卖似乎把他的聪明消耗完了。只要涉及麦子、面粉、粉粒，辨别品质、来路，注意保存，推测行市，预言收成的丰歉，用低价籴进谷子，从西西里、乌克兰去买来囤积，高里奥可以说没有敌手的。看他调度生意，解释粮食的出口法、进口法，研究立法的原则，利用法令的缺点等等，他颇有国务大臣的才气。办事又耐烦又干练，有魄力有恒心，行动迅速，目光犀利如鹰，什么都占先，什么都料到，什么都知道，什么都藏得紧，算计划策如外交家，勇往直前如军人。可是一离开他的本行，一出他黑魆魆的简陋的铺子，闲下来背靠门框站在阶沿上的时候，他仍不过是一个又蠢又粗野的工人，不会用头脑，感觉不到任何精神上的乐趣，坐在戏院里会打盹，总而言之，他是巴黎的那种陶里庞人[9]，只会闹笑话。这一类的人差不多完全相像，心里都有一股极高尚的情感。面条司务的心便是给两种感情填满的，吸干的，犹如他的聪明是为了粮食买卖用尽的。他的老婆是拉·勃里地方一个富农的独养女儿，是他崇拜赞美、敬爱无边的对象。高里奥赞美她生得又娇嫩又结实，又多情又美丽，跟他恰好是极端的对比。男人天生的情感，不是因为能随时保护弱者而感到骄傲吗？骄傲之外再加上爱，就可了解许多古怪的精神现象。所谓爱其实就是一般坦白的人对赐予他们快乐的人表示热烈的感激。过了七年圆满的幸福生活，高里奥的老婆死了；这是高里奥的不幸，因为那时她正开始在感情以外对他有点儿影响。也许她能把这个死板的人栽培一下，教他懂得一些世道和人生。既然她早死，疼爱女儿的感情便在高里奥心中发展到荒谬的程度。死神夺去了他所爱的对象，他的爱就转移到两个女儿身上，她们开始的确满足了他所有的感情。尽管一般争着要把女儿嫁给他做填房的商人或庄稼人，提出多么优越的条件，他都不愿意续娶。他的岳父，他唯一觉得气味相投的人，很有把握地说高里奥发过誓，永远不做对不起妻子的事，哪怕在她身后。中央市场的人不了解这种高尚的痴情，拿来取笑，替高里奥起了些粗俗的诨号。有个人跟高里奥做了一笔交易，喝着酒，第一个叫出这个外号，当场给面条商一拳打在肩膀上，脑袋向前，一直翻倒在奥勃冷街一块界石旁边。高里奥没头没脑地偏疼女儿，又多情又体贴的父爱，传布得遐迩闻名，甚至有一天，一个同行想教他离开市场以便操纵行情，告诉他说但斐纳被一辆马车撞翻了。面条商立刻面无人色地回家。他为了这场虚惊病了好几天。那造谣的人虽然并没受到凶狠的老拳，却在某次风潮中被逼破产，从此进不得市场。

两个女儿的教育，不消说是不会合理的了。富有每年六万法郎以上的进款，自己花不了一千二，高里奥的乐事只在于满足女儿们的幻想：最优秀的教师给请来培养她们高等教育应有的各种才艺；另外还有一个做伴的小姐；还算两个女儿运气，做伴的小姐是一个有头脑有品格的女子。两个女儿会骑马，有自备车辆，生活的奢华像一个有钱的老爵爷养的情妇，只要开声口，最奢侈的欲望，父亲也会满足她们，只要求女儿跟他亲热一下作为回敬。可怜的家伙，把女儿当作天使一流，当然是在他之上了。甚至她们给他的痛苦，他也喜欢。一到出嫁的年龄，她们可以随心所欲地挑选丈夫，各人可以有父亲一半的财产做陪嫁。特·雷斯多伯爵看中阿娜斯大齐生得美，她也很想当一个贵族太太，便离开父亲，跳进了高等社会。但斐纳喜欢金钱，嫁了纽沁根，一个原籍德国而在帝政时代封了男爵的银行家。高里奥依旧做他的面条商。不久，女儿女婿看他继续做那个买卖，觉得不痛快，虽然他除此以外，生命别无寄托。他们央求了五年，他才答应带着出盘铺子的钱跟五年的盈余退休。这笔资本所生的利息，便是他住进伏盖公寓的时代，伏盖太太估计到八千至一万的收入。看到女儿受着丈夫的压力，非但不招留他去住，还不愿公开在家招待他，绝望之下，他便搬进这个公寓。

受盘高老头铺子的缪莱先生供给的资料只有这一些。特·朗日公爵夫人对拉斯蒂涅说的种种猜测的话因此证实了。

这场暧昧而可怕的巴黎悲剧的序幕，在此结束。

初见世面


十二月第一星期的末了，拉斯蒂涅接到两封信，一封是母亲的，一封是大妹妹的。那些一望而知的笔迹使他快乐得心跳，害怕得发抖。对于他的希望，两张薄薄的纸等于一道生死攸关的判决书。想到父母姊妹的艰苦，他固然有点害怕；可是她们对他的溺爱，他太有把握了，尽可放心大胆吸取她们最后几滴血。母亲的信是这样写的：


“亲爱的孩子，你要的钱我寄给你了。但望好好地使用，下次即使要救你性命，我也不能瞒了父亲再张罗这样大的数目，那要动摇我们的命根，拿田地去抵押了。我不知道计划的内容，自然无从批评；但究竟是什么性质的计划，你不敢告诉我呢？要解释，用不着写上几本书，我们为娘的只要一句话就明白，而这句话可以免得我因为无从捉摸而牵肠挂肚。告诉你，来信使我非常痛苦。好孩子，究竟是什么情绪使你引起我这样的恐怖呢？你写信的时候大概非常难受吧，因为我看信的时候就很难受。你想干哪一行呢？难道你的前途，你的幸福，就在于装出你没有的身份，花费你负担不起的本钱，浪费你宝贵的求学的光阴，去见识那个社会吗？孩子，相信你母亲吧，拐弯抹角的路决无伟大的成就。像你这种情形的青年，应当以忍耐与安命为美德。我不埋怨你，我不愿我们的贡献对你有半点儿苦味。我的话是一个又相信儿子，又有远见的母亲的话。你知道你的责任所在，我也知道你的心是纯洁的，你的用意是极好的。所以我很放心地对你说：好，亲爱的，去干吧！我战战兢兢，因为我是母亲；但你每走一步，我们的愿望和祝福总是陪你一步。谨慎小心呀，亲爱的孩子。你应当像大人一般明哲，你心爱的五个人[1]的命运都在你的肩上。是啊，我们的财富都在你身上，正如你的幸福就是我们的幸福。我们都求上帝帮助你的计划。你的姑母真是好到极点，她甚至懂得你关于手套的话。她很快活地说，她对长子特别软心。欧也纳，你应该深深地爱她，她为你所做的事，等你成功以后再告诉你，否则她的钱要使你烫手的。你们做孩子的还不知道什么叫作牺牲纪念物！可是我们哪一样不能为你牺牲呢？她要我告诉你，说她亲你的前额，希望你常常快乐。倘不是手指害痛风症，她也要写信给你呢。父亲身体很好。今年的收成超过了我们的希望。再会了，亲爱的孩子，关于你妹妹们的事，我不说了，洛尔另外有信给你。她喜欢拉拉扯扯地谈家常，我就让她来了。但求上天使你成功！噢！是的，你非成功不可，欧也纳，你使我太痛苦了，我再也受不了第二次。因为巴望能有财产给我的孩子，我才懂得贫穷的滋味。好了，再会吧。切勿杳无音信。接受你母亲的亲吻吧。”



欧也纳念完信，哭了。他想到高老头扭掉镀金盘子，卖了钱替女儿还债的情景。“你的母亲也扭掉了她的首饰，”他对自己说，“姑母卖掉纪念物的时候一定也哭了。你有什么权利诅咒阿娜斯大齐呢？她为了情人，你为了只顾自己的前程，你比她强在哪里？”大学生肚子里有些热不可当的感觉。他想放弃上流社会，不拿这笔钱。这种良心上的责备正是心胸高尚的表现，一般人批判同胞的时候不大理会这一点，唯有天上的安琪儿才会考虑到，所以人间的法官所判的罪犯，常常会得到天使的赦免。拉斯蒂涅拆开妹子的信，天真而婉转的措辞使他心里轻松了些。


“亲爱的哥哥，你的信来得正好，阿迦德和我，想把我们的钱派作多少用场，简直决不定买哪样好了。你像西班牙王的仆人一样，打碎了主子的表，倒反解决了他的难题；你一句话教我们齐了心。真的，为了选择问题，我们老是在拌嘴，可做梦也想不到，原来只有一项用途真正能满足我们所有的欲望。阿迦德快活得直跳起来。我们俩乐得整天疯疯癫癫，以至于（姑母的说法）妈妈扮起一本正经的脸来问：‘什么事呀，两位小姐？’如果我们因此受到一言半语的埋怨，我相信我们还要快活呢。一个女子为了所爱的人受苦才是乐事！只有我在快乐之中觉得不痛快，有点儿心事。将来我绝不是一个贤惠的女人，我太会花钱，买了两根腰带，一支穿引胸衣小孔的美丽的引针，一些无聊东西，因此我的钱没有胖子阿迦德多；她很省俭，把洋钱一块块积起来像喜鹊一样。[2]她有两百法郎！我么，可怜的朋友，我只有一百五十。我大大地遭了报应，真想把腰带扔在井里，从此我用到腰带心中就要不舒适了。唉，我揩了你的油。阿迦德真好，她说：‘咱们把三百五十法郎合在一块儿寄给他吧！’实际情形恕不详细奉告！我们依照你的吩咐，拿了这笔了不得的款子假装出去散步，一上大路，直奔吕番克村，把钱交给驿站站长格冷贝先生。回来我们身轻如燕。阿迦德问我：‘是不是因为快乐我们身体这样轻？’我们不知讲了多少话，恕不细述了。反正谈的是你巴黎佬的事。噢！好哥哥，我们真爱你！要说守秘密吧，像我们这样的调皮姑娘，据姑母说，什么都做得出来，就是守口如瓶也办得到。母亲和姑母偷偷摸摸地上安古兰末，两人对旅行的目标绝口不提，动身之前，还经过一次长时期的会议，我们和男爵大人都不准参加。在拉斯蒂涅国里，大家纷纷猜测。公主们给王后陛下所绣的小孔纱衫，极秘密地赶起来，把两条边补足了。凡端伊方面决定不砌围墙，用篱笆代替。小百姓要损失果子，再没有钉在墙上的果树，但外人可以赏玩一下园内的好风景。如果王太子需要手帕，特·玛西阿母后在多年不动的库房里，找出了一匹遗忘已久的上等荷兰细布；阿迦德和洛尔两位公主，正在打点针线和老是冻得红红的手，听候太子命令。唐·亨利和唐·迦勃里哀两位小王子还是那么淘气：狂吞葡萄酱，惹姊姊们冒火，不肯念书，喜欢掏鸟窠，吵吵嚷嚷，冒犯禁令去砍伐柳条，做枪做棒。教皇的专使，俗称为本堂教士，威吓说要驱逐他们出教，如果他们再放着神圣的文法不学而去舞枪弄棒。再会吧，亲爱的哥哥，我这封信表示我对你全心全意的祝福，也表示我对你的友爱得到了极大的满足。你将来回家，一定有许多事情告诉我！你什么都不会瞒我，是不是？我是大妹妹呀。姑母曾经透露一句，说你在交际场中颇为得意。

只讲起一个女子，其余便只字不提。

只字不提，当然是对我们啰！喂！欧也纳，你需要的话，我们可以省下手帕的布替你做衬衣。关于这一点，快快来信。倘若你马上要做工很好的漂亮衬衫，我们得立刻赶做；有什么我们不知道的巴黎式样，你寄个样子来，尤其袖口。再会了，再会了！我吻你的左额，那是专属于我的。另外一张信纸我留给阿迦德，她答应凡是我写的话决不偷看。可是为保险起见，她写的时候我要在旁监视。

爱你的妹妹洛尔·特·拉斯蒂涅。”



“哦！是啊，是啊，”欧也纳心里想，“无论如何非发财不可！奇珍异宝也报答不了这样的忠诚。我得把世界上所有的幸福都带给她们。”他停了一会又想：“一千五百五十法郎，每个法郎都得用在刀口上！洛尔说得不错。该死！我只有粗布衬衫。为了男人的幸福，女孩子家曾像小偷一样机灵。她那么天真，为我设想却那么周到，犹如天上的安琪儿，根本不懂得尘世的罪过便宽恕了。”

于是世界是他的了！先把裁缝叫来，探过口气，居然答应赊账。见过了脱拉伊先生，拉斯蒂涅懂得裁缝对青年人的生活影响极大。为了账单，裁缝要不是一个死冤家，便是一个好朋友，总是走极端的。欧也纳所找的那个，懂得人要衣装的老话，自命为能够把青年人捧出山。后来拉斯蒂涅感激之余，在他那套巧妙的谈吐里有两句话，使那个成衣匠发了财：

“我知道有人靠了他做的两条裤子，攀了一门有两万法郎陪嫁的亲事。”

一千五百法郎现款，再加可以赊账的衣服！这么一来，南方的穷小子变得信心十足。他下楼用早餐的时候，自有一个年轻人有了几文的那种说不出的神气。钱落到一个大学生的口袋里，他马上觉得有了靠山。走路比从前有劲得多，杠杆有了着力的据点，眼神丰满，敢于正视一切，全身的动作也灵活起来；隔夜还怯生生的，挨了打不敢还手；此刻可有胆子得罪内阁总理了。他心中有了不可思议的变化：他无所不欲，无所不能，想入非非地又要这样又要那样，兴高采烈，豪爽非凡，话也多起来了。总之，从前没有羽毛的小鸟如今长了翅膀。没有钱的大学生拾取一星半点的欢娱，像一条狗冒着无穷的危险偷一根骨头，一边咬着嚼着，吮着骨髓，一边还在跑。等到小伙子袋里有了几枚不容易招留的金洋，就会把乐趣细细地体味，咀嚼，得意非凡，魂灵儿飞上半天，再不知穷苦二字怎讲。整个巴黎都是他的了。那是样样闪着金光、爆出火花的年龄！成年以后的男女哪还有这种快活劲儿！那是欠债的年龄，提心吊胆的年龄！而就因为提心吊胆，一切欢乐才格外有意思！凡是不熟悉塞纳河左岸，没有在拉丁区混过的人，根本不懂得人生！

拉斯蒂涅咬着伏盖太太家一个铜子一个的煮熟梨，心上想：“嘿！巴黎的妇女知道了，准会到这儿来向我求爱。”

这时栅门上的铃声一响，驿车公司的一个信差走进饭厅。他找欧也纳·特·拉斯蒂涅先生，交给他两只袋和一张签字的回单。欧也纳被伏脱冷深深地瞅了一眼，好像被鞭子抽了一下。

伏脱冷对他说：“那你可以去找老师学击剑打枪了。”

“金船到了。”伏盖太太瞧着钱袋说。

米旭诺小姐不敢对钱袋望，唯恐人家看出她贪心。

“你的妈妈真好。”古的太太说。

“他的妈妈真好，”波阿莱马上跟了一句。

“对啊，妈妈连血都挤出来了。”伏脱冷道，“现在你可以胡闹，可以交际，去钓一笔陪嫁，跟那些满头桃花的伯爵夫人跳舞了。可是听我的话，小朋友，靶子场非常去不可。”

伏脱冷做了一个瞄准的姿势。拉斯蒂涅想拿酒钱给信差，一个钱都掏不出来。伏脱冷拿一个法郎丢给来人。

“你的信用是不错的。”他望着大学生说。

拉斯蒂涅只得谢了他，虽然那天从鲍赛昂家回来，彼此抢白过几句以后，他非常讨厌这个家伙。在那八天之内，欧也纳和伏脱冷见了面都不作声，彼此只用冷眼观察。大学生想来想去也不明白是怎么回事。大概思想的放射，总是以孕育思想的力量为准的，头脑要把思想送到什么地方，思想便落在什么地方，准确性不下于从炮身里飞出去的弹丸，效果却个个不同。有些娇嫩的个性，思想可以钻进去损坏组织；也有些武装坚强的个性，铜墙铁壁式的头脑，旁人的意志打上去只能颓然堕下，好像炮弹射着城墙一样；还有软如棉花的个性，旁人的思想一碰到它便失掉作用，犹如炮弹落在堡垒外面的泥沟里。拉斯蒂涅的那种头脑却是装满了火药，一触即发，他朝气太旺，不能避免思想放射的作用，接触到别人的感情，不能不感染，许多古怪的现象在他不知不觉之间种在他心里。他的精神视觉像他的山猫眼睛一样明彻；每种灵敏的感官都有那种神秘的力量，能够感知遥远的思想，也具有那种反应敏捷、往返自如的弹性；我们在优秀的人物身上，善于把握敌人缺点的战士身上，就是佩服这种弹性。并且一个月以来，欧也纳所发展的优点跟缺点一样多。他的缺点是社会逼出来的，也是满足他日趋高涨的欲望所必需的。在他的优点中间，有一项是南方人的兴奋活泼，喜欢单刀直入解决困难，受不了不上不下的局面；北方人把这个优点称为缺点，他们以为这种性格如果是缪拉成功的秘诀，也是他丧命的原因。[3]由此可以得出一个结论：如果一个南方人把北方人的狡猾和洛阿河彼岸[4]的勇猛联合起来，就可成为全才，坐上瑞典的王位。[5]因此，拉斯蒂涅决不能长久处于伏脱冷的炮火之下，而不弄清楚这家伙究竟为敌为友。他常常觉得这怪人看透他的情欲，看透他的心思，而这怪人自己却把一切藏得那么严，其深不可测正如无所不知、无所不见而一言不发的斯芬克斯。这时欧也纳荷包里有了几文，想反抗了。伏脱冷喝完了最后几口咖啡，预备起身出去，欧也纳说：

“对不起，请你等一下。”

“干吗？”伏脱冷回答，一边戴上他的阔边大帽，提起铁手杖。平时他常常拿这根手杖在空中舞动，大有三四个强盗来攻击也不怕的神气。

“我要还你钱。”拉斯蒂涅说着，急急忙忙解开袋子，数出一百四十法郎给伏盖太太，说道：“账算清，朋友亲。到今年年底为止，咱们两讫了。再请兑五法郎零钱给我。”

“朋友亲，账算清。”波阿莱瞧着伏脱冷重复了一句。

“这儿还你一法郎。”拉斯蒂涅把钱授给那个戴假头发的斯芬克斯。

“好像你就怕欠我的钱，嗯？”伏脱冷大声说着，犀利的目光直瞧到他心里；那副涎皮赖脸的挖苦人的笑容，欧也纳一向讨厌，想跟他闹了好几回了。

“嗳……是的。”大学生回答，提着两只钱袋预备上楼了。

伏脱冷正要从通到客厅的门里出去，大学生想从通到楼梯道的门里出去。

“你知道吗，特·拉斯蒂涅喇嘛侯爵大人，你的话不大客气？”伏脱冷说着，砰的一声关上客厅的门，迎着大学生走过来。大学生冷冷地瞅着他。

拉斯蒂涅带上饭厅的门，拉着伏脱冷走到楼梯脚下。楼梯间有扇直达花园的板门，嵌着长玻璃，装着铁栅。西尔维正从厨房出来，大学生当着她的面说：

“伏脱冷先生，我不是侯爵，也不是什么拉斯蒂涅喇嘛。”

“他们要打架了。”米旭诺小姐不关痛痒地说。

“打架！”波阿莱跟着说。

“噢，不会的。”伏盖太太摩挲着她的一堆洋钱回答。

“他们到菩提树下去了，”维多莉小姐叫了声，站起来向窗外张望，“可怜的小伙子没有错啊。”

古的太太说：“上楼吧，亲爱的孩子，别管闲事。”

古的太太和维多莉起来走到门口，西尔维迎面拦住了去路，说道：

“什么事啊？伏脱冷先生对欧也纳先生说：咱们来评个理吧！说完抓着他的胳膊，踏着我们的朝鲜蓟走过去了。”

这时伏脱冷出现了。——“伏盖妈妈，”他笑道，“不用怕，我要到菩提树下去试试我的手枪。”

“哎呀！先生，”维多莉合着手说，“干吗你要打死欧也纳先生呢？”

伏脱冷退后两步，瞧着维多莉。

“又是一桩公案，”他那种嘲弄的声音把可怜的姑娘羞得满面通红，“这小伙子很可爱是不是？你叫我想起了一个主意。好，让我来成全你们俩的幸福吧，美丽的孩子。”

古的太太抓起女孩子的胳膊，一边走一边凑在她耳边说：

“维多莉，你今儿真是莫名其妙。”

伏盖太太道：“我不愿意人家在我这里打枪，你要惊动邻居，老清早叫警察上门了！”

“哦！放心，伏盖妈妈，”伏脱冷回答，“你别慌，我们到靶子场去就是了。”说罢他追上拉斯蒂涅，亲热地抓了他的手臂：

“等会你看我三十五步之外接连五颗子弹打在黑桃A[6]的中心，你不至于泄气吧？我看你有点生气了，那你可要糊里糊涂送命的呢。”

“你不敢啦？”欧也纳说。

“别惹我，”伏脱冷道，“今儿天气不冷，来这儿坐吧，”他指着几只绿漆的凳子，“行，这儿不会有人听见了。我要跟你谈谈。你是一个好小子，我不愿意伤了你。咱家鬼——（吓！该死！）咱家伏脱冷可以赌咒，我真喜欢你。为什么？我会告诉你的。现在只要你知道，我把你认识得清清楚楚，好像你是我生的一般。我可以给你证明。哎，把袋子放在这儿吧。”他指着圆桌说。

拉斯蒂涅把钱袋放在桌上，他不懂这家伙本来说要打死他，怎么又忽然装作他的保护人。

“你很想知道我是谁，干过什么事，现在又干些什么。你太好奇了，孩子。哎，不用急。我的话长呢。我倒过霉。你先听着，等会再回答。我过去的身世，倒过霉三个字儿就可以说完了。我是谁？伏脱冷。做些什么？做我爱做的事。完啦。你要知道我的性格吗？只要对我好的或是我觉得投机的人，我对他们和气得很。这种人可以百无禁忌，尽管在我小腿上踢几脚，我也不会说一声哼，当心！可是，小乖乖！那些跟我找麻烦的人，或是我觉得不对劲的，我会凶得像魔鬼。还得告诉你，我把杀人当作——呸这样的玩意儿！”说着他唾了一道口水，“不过我的杀人杀得很得体，倘使非杀不可的话。我是你们所说的艺术家。别小看我，我念过贝凡纽多·彻里尼[7]的《回忆录》，还是念的意大利文的原作！他是一个会作乐的好汉，我跟他学会了模仿天意，所谓天意，就是不分青红皂白把我们乱杀一阵。我也学会了到处爱美。你说，单枪匹马跟所有的人作对，把他们一齐打倒，不是挺美吗？对你们这个乱七八糟的社会组织，我仔细想过。告诉你，孩子，决斗是小娃娃的玩意儿，简直胡闹。两个人中间有一个多余的时候，只有傻瓜才会听凭偶然去决定。决斗吗？就像猜铜板！呃！我一口气在黑桃A的中心打进五颗子弹，一颗钉着一颗，还是在三十五步之外！有了这些小本领，总以为打中个把人是没问题的了。唉！哪知我隔开二十步打一个人竟没有中。对面那浑蛋，一辈子没有拿过手枪，可是你瞧！”他说着解开背心，露出像熊背一样多毛的胸脯，生着一簇教人又恶心又害怕的黄毛，“那乳臭未干的小子竟然把我的毛烧焦了。”他把拉斯蒂涅的手指按在他乳房的一个窟窿上。“那时我还是一个孩子，像你这个年纪，二十一岁。我还相信一些东西，譬如说，相信一个女人的爱情，相信那些弄得你七荤八素的荒唐事儿。我们交起手来，你可能把我打死。假定我躺在地下了，你怎么办？得逃走啰，上瑞士去，白吃爸爸的，而爸爸也没有几文。你现在的情形，让我来点醒你；我的看法高人一等，因为我有生活经验，知道只有两条路好走：不是糊里糊涂地服从，就是反抗。我，还用说吗？我对什么都不服从。照你现在这个派头，你知道你需要什么，一百万家财，而且要快；不然的话，你尽管胡思乱想，一切都是水中捞月，白费！这一百万，我来给你吧。”他停了一下，望着欧也纳。“啊！啊！现在你对伏脱冷老头的神气好一些了。一听我那句话，你就像小姑娘听见人家说了声：晚上见，便理理毛，舐舐嘴唇，有如喝过牛奶的猫咪。这才对啦。来，来，咱们合作吧。先算算你那笔账，小朋友。家乡，咱们有爸爸、妈妈、祖姑母、两个妹妹（一个十八一个十七）、两个兄弟（一个十五一个十岁），这是咱们的花名册。祖姑母管教两个妹妹，神父教两个兄弟拉丁文。家里总是多喝栗子汤，少吃白面包；爸爸非常爱惜他的裤子，妈妈难得添一件冬衣和夏衣，妹妹们能将就便将就了。我什么都知道，我住过南方。要是家里每年给你一千二，田里的收入统共只有三千，那么你们的情形就是这样。咱们有一个厨娘，一个当差，面子总要顾到，爸爸还是男爵呢。至于咱们自己，咱们有野心，有鲍赛昂家撑腰，咱们拼着两条腿走去，心里想发财，袋里空空如也；嘴里吃着伏盖妈妈的起码饭菜，心里爱着圣·日耳曼区的山珍海味；睡的是破床，想的是高堂大厦！我不责备你的欲望。我的小心肝，野心不是个个人有的。你去问问娘儿们，她们追求的是怎么样的男人，还不是野心家？野心家比旁的男子腰粗臂胖，血中铁质更多，心也更热。女人强壮的时候真快乐，真好看，所以在男人中专挑有力气的爱，便是给他压坏也甘心。我一项一项举出你的欲望，好向你提出问题。问题是这样：咱们肚子饿得像狼，牙齿又尖又快，怎么办才能弄到大鱼大肉？第一要吞下《法典》，那可不是好玩的事，也学不到什么；可是这一关非过不可。好，就算过了关，咱们去当律师，预备将来在重罪法庭当一个庭长，把一些英雄好汉，肩膀上刺了T．F．[8]打发出去，好让财主们太太平平地睡觉。这可不是味儿，而且时间很长。先得在巴黎愁眉苦脸地熬两年，对咱们馋涎欲滴的美果只许看，不许碰。老想要而要不到，才磨人呢。倘若你面无血色，性格软绵绵的像条虫，那还不成问题；不幸咱们的血像狮子的一样滚烫，胃口奇好，一天可以胡闹二十次。这样你就受罪啦，受好天爷地狱里最凶的刑罚啦。就算你安分守己，只喝牛奶，作些哀伤的诗；可是熬尽了千辛万苦，憋着一肚子怨气之后，你总得，不管你怎样的胸襟高旷，先要在一个浑蛋手下当代理检察，在什么破落的小城里，政府丢给你一千法郎薪水，好像把残羹冷饭扔给一条肉铺里的狗。你的职司是钉在小偷背后狂吠，替有钱的人辩护，把有心肝的送上断头台。你非这样不可！要没有靠山，你就在外省法院里发霉。到三十岁，你可以当一名年俸一千二的推事，倘若捧住饭碗的话。熬到四十岁，娶一个磨坊主人的女儿，带来六千上下的陪嫁。得啦，谢谢吧。要是有靠山，三十岁上你便是检察官，五千法郎薪水，娶的是市长的女儿。再玩一下卑鄙的政治手段，譬如读选举票，把自由党的玛虞哀念作保王党的维莱（既然押韵，用不着良心不安），你可以在四十岁上升做首席检察官，还能当议员。你要注意，亲爱的孩子，这么做是要咱们昧一下良心，吃二十年苦，无声无臭地受二十年难，咱们的姊妹只能当老姑娘终身。还得奉告一句：首席检察官的缺份，全法国统共只有二十个，候补的有两万，其中尽有些不要脸的，为了升官发财，不惜出卖妻儿子女。如果这一行你觉得倒胃口，那么再来瞧瞧旁的。特·拉斯蒂涅男爵有意当律师吗？噢！好极了！先得熬上十年，每月一千法郎开销，要一套藏书，一间事务所，出去应酬，卑躬屈膝地巴结诉讼代理人，才能招揽案子，到法院去吃灰。要是这一行能够使你出头，那也罢了；可是你去问一问，五十岁左右每年挣五万法郎以上的律师，巴黎有没有五个？吓！与其受这样的委屈，还不如去当海盗。再说，哪儿来的本钱？这都泄气得很。不错，还有一条出路是女人的陪嫁。哦，你愿意结婚吗？那等于把一块石头挂上自己的脖子。何况为了金钱而结婚，咱们的荣誉感，咱们的志气，又放到哪儿去？还不如现在就反抗社会！像一条蛇似的躺在女人前面，舐着丈母的脚，做出叫母猪也害臊的卑鄙事情，呸！这样要能换到幸福，倒还罢了。但这种情形之下娶来的老婆，会教你倒霉得像阴沟盖。跟自己的老婆斗还不如同男人打架。这是人生的三岔口，朋友，你挑吧。你已经挑定了，你去过表亲鲍赛昂家，嗅到了富贵气。你也去过高老头的女儿雷斯多太太家，闻到了巴黎妇女的味道。那天你回来，脸上明明白白写着几个字：往上爬！不顾一切地往上爬。我暗中叫好，心里想这倒是一个配我脾胃的汉子。你要用钱，哪儿去找呢？你抽了姊妹的血。做弟兄的多多少少全骗过姊妹的钱。你家乡多的是栗子，少的是洋钱，天知道怎么弄来的一千五百法郎，往外溜的时候跟大兵出门抢劫一样快，钱完了怎么办？用功吗？用功的结果，你现在明白了，是给波阿莱那等角色老来在伏盖妈妈家租间屋子。跟你情形相仿的四五万青年，此刻都有一个问题要解决：赶快挣一笔财产。你是其中的一个。你想：你们要怎样地拼命，怎样地斗争；势必你吞我，我吞你，像一个瓶里的许多蜘蛛，因为根本没有四五万个好缺份。你知道巴黎的人怎么打天下的？不是靠天才的光芒，就是靠腐蚀的本领。在这个人堆里，不像炮弹一般轰进去，就得像瘟疫一般钻进去。清白老实一无用处。在天才的威力之下，大家会屈服；先是恨他，毁谤他，因为他一口独吞，不肯分肥；可是他要坚持的话，大家便屈服了；总而言之，没法把你埋在土里的时候，就向你磕头。雄才大略是少有的，遍地风行的是腐化堕落。社会上多的是饭桶，而腐蚀便是饭桶的武器，你到处觉得有它的刀尖。有些男人，全部家私不过六千法郎薪水，老婆的衣着花到一万以上。收入只有一千二的小职员也会买田买地。你可以看到一些女人出卖身体，为的要跟贵族院议员的公子，坐了车到隆尚跑马场的中央大道上去奔驰。女儿有了五万法郎进款，可怜的脓包高老头还不得不替女儿还债，那是你亲眼看见的。你试着瞧吧，在巴黎走两三步路要不碰到这一类的鬼玩意才怪。我敢把脑袋跟这一堆生菜打赌，你要碰到什么你中意的女人，不管是谁，不管怎样有钱，美丽，年轻，你马上掉在黄蜂窠里。她们受着法律束缚，什么事都得跟丈夫明争暗斗。为了情人，衣着，孩子，家里的开销，虚荣，所玩的手段，简直说不完，反正不是为了高尚的动机。所以正人君子是大众的公敌。你知道什么叫作正人君子吗？在巴黎，正人君子是不声不响、不愿分赃的人。至于那批可怜的公共奴隶，到处做苦工而没有报酬的，还没有包括在内；我管他们叫作相信上帝的傻瓜。当然这是德行的最高峰，愚不可及的好榜样，同时也是苦海。倘若上帝开个玩笑，在最后审判时缺席一下，那些好人包你都要愁眉苦脸！因此，你要想快快发财，必须现在已经有钱，或者装作有钱。要弄大钱，就该大刀阔斧地干，要不就完事大吉。三百六十行中，倘使有十几个人成功得快，大家便管他们叫作贼。你自己去找结论吧。人生就是这么回事。跟厨房一样腥臭。要捞油水不能怕弄脏手，只消事后洗干净；今日所谓道德，不过是这一点。我这样议论社会是有权利的，因为我认识社会。你以为我责备社会吗？绝对不是。世界一向是这样的。道德家永远改变不了它。人是不完全的，不过他的作假有时多有时少，一般傻子便跟着说风俗淳朴了，或是浇薄了。我并不帮平民骂富翁，上中下三等的人都是一样的人。这些高等野兽，每一百万中间总有十来个狠家伙，高高地坐在一切之上，甚至坐在法律之上，我便是其中之一。你要有种，你就扬着脸一直线往前冲。可是你得跟妒忌、毁谤、庸俗斗争，跟所有的人斗争。拿破仑碰到一个叫作奥勃里的陆军部长，差一点送他往殖民地。[9]你自己忖一忖吧！看你是否能每天早上起来，比隔夜更有勇气。倘然是的话，我可以给你提出一个谁也不会拒绝的计划。喂，你听着。我有个主意在这儿。我想过一种长老生活，在美国南部弄一大块田地，就算十万阿尔邦吧。[10]我要在那边种植，买奴隶，靠了卖牛、卖烟草、卖林木的生意挣他几百万，把日子过得像小皇帝一样；那种随心所欲的生活，蹲在这儿破窑里的人连做梦也做不到的。我是一个大诗人。我的诗不是写下来的，而是在行动和感情上表现的。此刻我有五万法郎，只够买四十名黑人。我需要二十万法郎，因为我要两百个黑人，才能满足我长老生活的瘾。黑人，你懂不懂？那是一些自生自发的孩子，你爱把他们怎办就怎办，决没有一个好奇的检察官来过问。有了这笔黑资本，十年之内可以挣到三四百万。我要成功了，就没有人盘问我出身。我就是四百万先生，合众国公民。那时我才五十岁，不至于发霉，我爱怎么玩儿就怎么玩儿。总而言之，倘若我替你弄到一百万陪嫁，你肯不肯给我二十万？两成佣金，不算太多吧？你可以教小媳妇儿爱你。一朝结了婚，你得表示不安，懊恼，半个月工夫装作闷闷不乐。然后，某一天夜里，先来一番装腔作势，再在两次亲吻之间，对你老婆说出有二十万的债，当然那时要把她叫作心肝宝贝啰！这种戏文天天都有一批最优秀的青年在搬演。一个少女把心给了你，还怕不肯打开钱袋吗？你以为你损失了吗？不。一桩买卖就能把二十万捞回来。凭你的资本，凭你的头脑，挣多大的家财都不成问题。于是乎[11]，你在六个月中间造成了你的幸福，造成了一个小娇娘的幸福，还有伏脱冷老头的幸福，还有你父母姊妹的幸福，他们此刻不是缺少木柴，手指冻得发疼吗？我的提议跟条件，你不用大惊小怪！巴黎六十件美满的婚姻，总有四十七件是这一类的交易。公证人公会曾经强逼某先生……”

“要我怎么办呢？”拉斯蒂涅急不可待地打断了伏脱冷的话。

“噢，用不着你多费心的，”伏脱冷回答的时候，那种高兴好比一个渔翁觉得鱼儿上了钩，“你听我说！凡是可怜的、遭难的女子，她的心等于一块极需要爱情的海绵，只消一滴感情，立刻膨胀。追求一个孤独，绝望，贫穷，想不到将来有大家私的姑娘，呃！那简直是拿了一手同花顺子[12]，或是知道了头奖的号码去买奖券，或是得了消息去做公债。你的亲事就像在三合土上打了根基。一朝有几百万家财落在那姑娘头上，她会当作泥土一般扔在你脚下，说道：‘拿吧，我的心肝！拿吧，阿陶夫！阿弗莱！拿吧，欧也纳！’只消阿陶夫、阿弗莱，或者欧也纳有那聪明的头脑肯为她牺牲。所谓牺牲，不过是卖掉一套旧衣服，换几个钱一同上蓝钟饭铺吃一顿香菌包子；晚上再到滑稽剧院看一场戏；或者把表送往当铺，买一条披肩送她。那些爱情的小玩意儿，无须跟你细说；多少女人都喜欢那一套，譬如写情书的时候，在信笺上洒几滴水冒充眼泪等等，我看你似乎完全懂得调情的把戏。你瞧，巴黎仿佛新大陆上的森林，有无数的野蛮民族在活动，什么伊林诺人，许龙人，都在社会上靠打猎过活。你是个追求百万家财的猎人，得用陷阱，用鸟笛，用哨子去猎取。打猎的种类很多：有的猎取陪嫁；有的猎取破产后的清算；[13]有的出卖良心，有的出卖无法抵抗的订户。[14]凡是满载而归的人都被敬重、庆贺，受上流社会招待。说句公平话，巴黎的确是世界上最好客的城市。如果欧洲各大京城高傲的贵族，不许一个声名狼藉的百万富翁跟他们称兄道弟，巴黎自会对他张开臂抱，赴他的宴会，吃他的饭，跟他碰杯，祝贺他的丑事。”

“可是哪儿去找这样一个姑娘呢？”欧也纳问。

“就在眼前，听你摆布！”

“维多莉小姐吗？”

“对啦！”

“怎么？”

“她已经爱上你了，你那个特·拉斯蒂涅男爵夫人！”

“她一个子儿都没有呢。”欧也纳很诧异地说。

“噢！这个吗？再补上两句，事情就明白了。泰伊番老头在大革命时代暗杀过他的一个朋友；他是跟咱们一派的好汉，思想独往独来。他是银行家，弗莱特烈—泰伊番公司的大股东；他想把全部家产传给独养儿子，把维多莉一脚踢开。咱家我，可不喜欢这种不平事儿。我好似堂吉诃德，专爱锄强扶弱。如果上帝的意志要召回他的儿子，泰伊番自会承认女儿；他好歹总要一个继承人，这又是人类天生的傻脾气；可是他不能再生孩子，我知道。维多莉温柔可爱，很快会把老子哄得回心转意，用感情弄得他团团转，像个德国陀螺似的。你对她的爱情，她感激万分，决不会忘掉，她会嫁给你。我么，我来替天行道，教上帝发愿。我有个生死之交的朋友，洛阿军团[15]的上校，最近调进王家卫队。他听了我的话加入极端派的保王党，他才不是固执成见的糊涂蛋呢。顺便得忠告你一句，好朋友，你不能拿自己的话当真，也不能拿自己的主张当真。有人要收买你的主张，不妨出卖。一个自命为从不改变主张的人，是一个永远走直线的人，相信自己永远正确的大傻瓜。世界上没有原则，只有事故；没有法律，只有时势；高明的人同事故跟时势打成一片，任意支配。倘若真有什么固定的原则跟法律，大家也不能随时更换，像咱们换衬衫一样容易了。一个人用不着比整个民族更智慧。替法国出力最少的倒是受人膜拜的偶像，因为他老走激进的路；其实这等人至多只能放在博物院中跟机器一块儿，挂上一条标签，叫他作拉斐德[16]，至于被每个人丢石子的那位亲王，根本瞧不起人类，所以人家要他发多少誓便发多少誓；他却在维也纳会议中使法国免于瓜分；他替人争了王冠，人家却把污泥丢在他脸上。[17]噢！什么事的底细我都明白；人家的秘密我知道的才多呢！不用多说了。只消有一天能碰到三个人对一条原则的运用意见一致，我就佩服，我马上可以采取一个坚决的主张；可是不知何年何月才有这么一天呢！对同一条法律的解释，法庭上就没有三个推事意见相同。言归正传，说我那个朋友吧。只消我开声口，他会把耶稣基督重新钉上十字架。凭我伏脱冷老头一句话，他会跟那个小子寻事，他——对可怜的妹子连一个子儿都不给，哼！——……然后……”

伏脱冷站起身子，摆着姿势，好似一个剑术教师准备开步的功架：

“然后，请他回老家！”

“怕死人了！”欧也纳道，“你是开玩笑吧，伏脱冷先生？”

“哟！哟！哟！别紧张，”他回答，“别那么孩子气。你要是愿意，尽管去生气，去冒火！说我恶棍、坏蛋、无赖、强盗，都行，只别叫我骗子，也别叫我奸细！来吧，开口吧，把你的连珠炮放出来吧！我原谅你，在你的年纪上那是挺自然的！我就是过来人！不过得仔细想一想。也许有一天你干的事比这个更要不得，你会去拍漂亮女人的马屁，接受她的钱。你已经在这么想了。因为你要不在爱情上预支，你的梦想怎么能成功？亲爱的大学生，德行是不可分割的，是则是，非则非，一点没有含糊。有人说罪过可以补赎，可以用忏悔来抵消！哼，笑话！为要爬到社会上的某一级而去勾引一个女人，离间一家的弟兄，总之为了个人的快活和利益，明里暗里所干的一切卑鄙勾当，你以为合乎信仰、希望、慈悲三大原则吗？一个纨绔子弟引诱未成年的孩子一夜之间丢了一半家产，凭什么只判两个月徒刑？一个可怜的穷鬼在加重刑罚的情节[18]中偷了一千法郎，凭什么就判终身苦役？这是你们的法律。没有一条不荒谬。戴了黄手套说漂亮话的人物，杀人不见血，永远躲在背后；普通的杀人犯却在黑夜里用铁棍撬门进去，那明明是犯了加重刑罚的条款了。我现在向你提议的，跟你将来所要做的，差别只在于见血不见血。你还相信世界上真有什么固定不变的东西！嗳！千万别把人放在眼里，倒应该研究一下法纲上哪儿有漏洞。只要不是彰明较著发的大财，骨子里都是大家遗忘了的罪案，只是案子做得干净罢了。”

“别说了，先生，我不能再听下去，你要教我对自己都怀疑了，这时我只能听感情指导。”

“随你吧，孩子。我只道你是个硬汉；我再不跟你说什么了。不过，最后交代你一句，”他目不转睛地瞪着大学生，“我的秘密交给你了。”

“不接受你计划，当然会忘掉的。”

“说得好，我听了很高兴。不是么，换了别人，就不会这么谨慎体贴了。别忘了我这番心意。等你半个月。要就办，不就算了。”

眼看伏脱冷挟着手杖，若无其事地走了，拉斯蒂涅不禁想道：“好一个死心眼儿的家伙！特·鲍赛昂太太文文雅雅对我说的，他赤裸裸地说了出来。他拿钢铁般的利爪把我的心撕得粉碎。干吗我要上特·纽沁根太太家去？我刚转好念头，他就猜着了。关于德行，这强盗坯三言两语告诉我的，远过于多少人物多少书本所说的。如果德行不允许妥协，我岂不是偷盗了我的妹妹？”

他把钱袋往桌上一扔，坐下来胡思乱想。

“忠于德行，就是做一个伟大的殉道者！喝！个个人相信德行，可是谁是有德行的？民众崇拜自由，可是自由的人民在哪儿？我的青春还像明净无云的蓝天，可是巴望富贵，不就是决定扯谎，屈膝，在地下爬，逢迎吹拍，处处作假吗？不就是甘心情愿听那般扯过谎，屈过膝，在地下爬过的人使唤吗？要加入他们的帮口，先得侍候他们。呸！那不行。我要规规矩矩、清清白白地用功，日以继夜地用功，凭劳力来挣我的财产。这是求富贵最慢的路，但我每天可以问心无愧地上床。白璧无瑕，像百合一样的纯洁，将来回顾一生的时候，岂不挺美？我跟人生，还像一个青年和他的未婚妻一样新鲜。伏脱冷却教我看到婚后十年的情景。该死！我越想越糊涂了。还是什么都不去想，听凭我的感情指导吧。”

胖子西尔维的声音赶走了欧也纳的幻想，她报告说裁缝来了。他拿了两口钱袋站在裁缝前面，觉得这个场面倒也不讨厌。试过夜礼服，又试一下白天穿的新装，他马上变了一个人。

他心上想：“还怕比不上特·脱拉伊？还不是一样的绅士气派？”

“先生，”高老头走进欧也纳的屋子说，“你可是问我特·纽沁根太太上哪些地方应酬吗？”

“是啊。”

“下星期一，她要参加特·加里里阿诺元帅的跳舞会。要是你能够去，请你回来告诉我，她们姊妹俩是不是玩得痛快，穿些什么衣衫，总之，你要样样说给我听。”

“你怎么知道的？”欧也纳让他坐在火炉旁边问他。

“她的老妈子告诉我的。从丹兰士和公斯当斯[19]那边，我打听出她们的一举一动。”他像一个年轻的情人因为探明了情妇的行踪，对自己的手段非常得意。“你可以看到她们了，你！”他的艳羡与痛苦都天真地表现了出来。

“还不知道呢，”欧也纳回答，“我要去见特·鲍赛昂太太，问她能不能把我介绍给元帅夫人。”

欧也纳想到以后能够穿着新装上子爵夫人家，不由得暗中欢喜。伦理学家所谓人心的深渊，无非指一些自欺欺人的思想，不知不觉只顾自己利益的念头。那些突然的变化，来一套仁义道德的高调，又突然回到老路上去，都是迎合我们求快乐的愿望的。眼看自己穿扮齐整，手套靴子样样合格之后，拉斯蒂涅又忘了敦品励学的决心。青年人陷于不义的时候，不敢对良心的镜子照一照；成年人却不怕正视；人生两个阶段的不同完全在于这一点。

几天以来，欧也纳和高老头这对邻居成了好朋友。他们心照不宣的友谊，伏脱冷和大学生的不投机，其实都出于同样的心理。将来倘有什么大胆的哲学家，想肯定我们的感情对物质世界的影响，一定能在人与动物的关系中找到不少确实的例子，证明感情并不是抽象的。譬如说，看相的人推测一个人的性格，决不能一望而知，像狗知道一个陌生人对它的爱憎那么快。有些无聊的人想淘汰古老的字眼，可是物以类聚这句成语始终挂在每个人的嘴边。受到人家的爱，我们是感觉到的。感情在无论什么东西上面都能留下痕迹，并且能穿越空间。一封信代表一颗灵魂，等于口语的忠实的回声，所以敏感的人把信当作爱情的至宝。高老头的盲目的感情，已经把他像狗一样的本能发展到出神入化，自然能体会大学生对他的同情、钦佩和好意。可是初期的友谊还没有到推心置腹的阶段。欧也纳以前固然表示要见特·纽沁根太太，却并不想托老人介绍，而仅仅希望高里奥漏出一点儿口风给他利用。高老头也直到欧也纳访问了阿娜斯大齐和特·鲍赛昂太太回来，当众说了那番话，才和欧也纳提起女儿。他说：

“亲爱的先生，你怎么能以为说出了我的名字，特·雷斯多太太便生你的气呢？两个女儿都很孝顺，我是个幸福的父亲。只是两个女婿对我不好。我不愿意为了跟女婿不和，教两个好孩子伤心；我宁可暗地里看她们。这种偷偷摸摸的快乐，不是那些随时可以看到女儿的父亲所能了解的。我不能那么办，你懂不懂？所以碰到好天气，先问过老妈子女儿是否出门，我上香榭丽舍大道去等。车子来的时候，我的心跳起来；看她们穿扮那么漂亮，我多高兴。她们顺便对我笑一笑，噢！那就像天上照下一道美丽的阳光，把世界镀了金。我待在那儿，她们还要回来呢。是呀，我又看见她们了！呼吸过新鲜空气，脸蛋儿红红的。周围的人说：‘哦！多漂亮的女人！’我听了多开心。那不是我的亲骨血吗？我喜欢替她们拉车的马，我愿意做她们膝上的小狗。她们快乐，我才觉得活得有意思。各有各的爱的方式，我那种爱又不妨碍谁，干吗人家要管我的事？我有我享福的办法。晚上去看女儿出门上跳舞会，难道犯法吗？要是去晚了，知道‘太太已经走了’，那我才伤心死呢！有一晚我等到清早三点，才看到两天没有见面的娜齐。我快活得几乎晕过去！我求你，以后提到我，一定得说我女儿孝顺。她们要送我各式各样的礼物，我把她们拦住了，我说：‘不用破费呀！我要那些礼物干什么？我一样都不缺少。’真的，亲爱的先生，我是什么东西？不过是一个臭皮囊罢了，只是一颗心老跟着女儿。”

那时欧也纳想出门先上杜伊勒里公园遛遛，然后到了时间去拜访特·鲍赛昂太太。高老头停了一忽又说：“将来你见过了特·纽沁根太太，告诉我你在两个之中更喜欢哪一个。”

这次的散步是欧也纳一生的关键。有些女人注意到他了：他那么美，那么年轻，那么体面，那么风雅！一看到自己成为路人赞美的目标，立刻忘了被他罗掘一空的姑母姊妹，也忘了良心的指摘。他看见头上飞过那个极像天使的魔鬼，五色翅膀的撒旦，一路撒着红宝石，把黄金的箭射在宫殿前面，把女人们穿得大红大紫，把简陋的王座蒙上恶俗的光彩；他听着那个虚荣的魔鬼唠叨，把虚幻的光彩认为权势的象征。伏脱冷的议论尽管那样的玩世不恭，已经深深地种在他心头，好比处女的记忆中有个媒婆的影子，对她说过：“黄金和爱情，滔滔不尽！”

懒洋洋地溜达到五点左右，欧也纳去见特·鲍赛昂太太，不料碰了个钉子，青年人无法抵抗的那种钉子。至此为止，他觉得子爵夫人非常客气，非常殷勤；那是贵族教育的表现，不一定有什么真情实意的。他一进门，特·鲍赛昂太太便做了一个不高兴的姿势，冷冷地说：

“特·拉斯蒂涅先生，我不能招待你，至少在这个时候！我忙得很……”

对于一个能察言观色的人，而拉斯蒂涅已经很快地学会了这一套，这句话，这个姿势，这副眼光，这种音调，原原本本说明了贵族阶级的特性和习惯；他在丝绒手套下面瞧见了铁掌，在仪态万方之下瞧见了本性和自私，在油漆之下发现了木料。总之他听见了从王上到末等贵族一贯的口气：我是王。以前欧也纳把她的话过于当真，过于相信她的心胸宽大。不幸的人只道恩人与受恩的人是盟友，以为一切伟大的心灵完全平等。殊不知使恩人与受恩的人同心一体的那种慈悲，是跟真正的爱情同样绝无仅有，同样不受了解的天国的热情。两者都是优美的心灵慷慨豪爽的表现。拉斯蒂涅一心想踏进特·加里里阿诺公爵夫人的舞会，也就忍受了表姊的脾气。

“太太，”他声音颤巍巍地说，“没有要紧事儿，我也不敢来惊动你，你包涵点儿吧，我回头再来。”

“行，那么你来吃饭吧。”她对刚才的严厉有点不好意思了；因为这位太太的好心的确不下于她的高贵。

虽则突然之间的转圜使欧也纳很感动，他临走仍不免有番感慨：“爬就是了，什么都得忍受。连心地最好的女子一刹那间也会忘掉友谊的诺言，把你当破靴似的扔掉，旁的女人还用说吗？各人自扫门前雪，想不到竟是如此！不错，她的家不是铺子，我不该有求于她。真得像伏脱冷所说的，像一颗炮弹似的轰进去！”

不久想到要在子爵夫人家吃饭的快乐，大学生的牢骚也就没有了。就是这样，好似命中注定似的，他生活中一切琐琐碎碎的事故，都逼他如伏脱冷所说的，在战场上为了不被人杀而不得不杀人，为了不受人骗而不得不骗人，把感情与良心统统丢开，戴上假面具，冷酷无情地玩弄人，神不知鬼不觉地去猎取富贵。

他回到子爵夫人家，发现她满面春风，又是向来的态度了。两人走进饭厅，子爵早已等在那儿。大家知道，王政时代是饮食最奢侈的时代。特·鲍赛昂先生什么都玩腻了，除了讲究吃喝以外，再没有旁的嗜好；他在这方面跟路易十八和台斯加公爵[20]是同道。他饭桌上的奢侈是外表和内容并重的。欧也纳还是第一遭在世代簪缨之家用餐，没有见识过这等场面。舞会结束时的消夜餐在帝政时代非常时行，军人们非饱餐一顿，养足精神，应付不了国内国外的斗争。当时的风气把这种消夜餐取消了。欧也纳过去只参加过舞会。幸亏他态度持重——将来他在这一点上很出名的，而那时已经开始有些气度——并没显得大惊小怪。可是眼见镂刻精工的银器，席面上那些说不尽的讲究，第一次领教到毫无声响的侍应，一个富于想象的人怎么能不羡慕无时无刻不高雅的生活，而不厌弃他早上所想的那种清苦生涯呢！他忽然想到公寓的情形，觉得厌恶之极，发誓正月里非搬家不可：一则换一所干净的屋子，一则躲开伏脱冷，免得精神上受他的威胁。头脑清楚的人真要问，巴黎既有成千成万、有声无声的伤风败俗之事，怎么国家会如此糊涂，把学校放在这个城里，让青年人聚集在一起？怎么美丽的妇女还会受到尊重？怎么兑换商堆在铺面上的黄金不至于从木钟[21]里不翼而飞？再拿青年人很少犯罪的情形来看，那些耐心的饥荒病者拼命压止馋痨的苦功，更令人佩服了！穷苦的大学生跟巴黎的斗争，好好描写下来，便是现代文明最悲壮的题材。

特·鲍赛昂太太瞅着欧也纳逗他说话，他却始终不肯在子爵面前开一声口。

“你今晚陪我上意大利剧院去吗？”子爵夫人问她的丈夫。

“能够奉陪在我当然是桩快乐的事，”子爵的回答殷勤之中带点儿俏皮，欧也纳根本没有发觉，“可惜我要到多艺剧院去会朋友。”

“他的情妇啰。”她心里想。

“阿瞿达今晚不来陪你吗？”子爵问。

“不。”她回答的神气不大高兴。

“嗳，你一定要人陪的话，不是有拉斯蒂涅先生在这里吗？”

子爵夫人笑盈盈地望着欧也纳，说道：“对你可不大方便吧？”

“夏多勃里昂先生说过：法国人喜欢冒险，因为冒险之中有光荣。”欧也纳弯了弯身子回答。

过了一会，欧也纳坐在特·鲍赛昂太太旁边，给一辆飞快的轿车送往那个时髦剧院。他走进一个正面的包厢，和子爵夫人同时成为无数手眼镜的目标，子爵夫人的装束美艳无比。欧也纳几乎以为进了神仙世界。再加销魂荡魄之事接踵而至。

子爵夫人问道：“你不是有话跟我说吗？哟！你瞧，特·纽沁根太太就离我们三个包厢。她的姊姊同特·脱拉伊先生在另外一边。”

子爵夫人说着对洛希斐特小姐的包厢瞟了一眼，看见特·阿瞿达先生并没在座，顿时容光焕发。

“她可爱得很。”欧也纳瞧了瞧特·纽沁根太太。

“她的眼睫毛黄得发白。”

“不错，可是多美丽的细腰身！”

“手很大。”

“噢！眼睛美极了！”

“脸太长。”

“长有长的漂亮。”

“真的吗？那是她运气了。你瞧她手眼镜举起放下的姿势！每个动作都脱不了高里奥气息。”子爵夫人这些话使欧也纳大为诧异。

特·鲍赛昂太太擎着手眼镜照来照去，似乎并没注意特·纽沁根太太，其实是把每个举动瞧在眼里。剧院里都是漂亮人物。可是特·鲍赛昂太太的年轻、俊俏、风流的表弟，只注意但斐纳·特·纽沁根一个，叫但斐纳看了着实得意。

“先生，你对她尽瞧下去，要给人家笑话了。这样不顾一切地死钉人是不会成功的。”

“亲爱的表姊，我已经屡次承蒙你照应，倘使你愿意成全我的话，只请你给我一次惠而不费的帮助。我已经入迷了。”

“这么快？”

“是的。”

“就是这一个吗？”

“还有什么旁的地方可以施展我的抱负呢？”他对表姊深深地望了一眼，停了一忽又道，“特·加里里阿诺公爵夫人跟特·斐里夫人很要好。你见到她的时候，请你把我介绍给她，带我去赴她下星期一的跳舞会。我可以在那儿碰到特·纽沁根太太，试试我的本领。”

“好吧，既然你已经看中她，你的爱情一定顺利。瞧，特·玛赛在特·迦拉蒂沃纳公主的包厢里。特·纽沁根太太在受罪啦，她气死啦。要接近一个女人，尤其银行家的太太，再没比这个更好的机会了。唐打区的妇女都是喜欢报复的。”

“你碰到这情形又怎么办？”

“我么，我就不声不响地受苦。”

这时特·阿瞿达侯爵走进特·鲍赛昂太太的包厢。

他说：“因为要来看你，我把事情都弄糟啦，我先提一声，免得我白白牺牲。”

欧也纳觉得子爵夫人脸上的光辉是真爱情的表示，不能同巴黎式的调情打趣、装腔作势混为一谈。他对表姊钦佩之下，不说话了，叹了口气把座位让给阿瞿达，心里想：“一个女人爱到这个地步，真是多高尚，多了不起！这家伙为了一个玩具式的娃娃把她丢了，真叫人想不通。”他像小孩子一样气愤之极，很想在特·鲍赛昂太太脚下打滚，恨不得有魔鬼般的力量把她抢到自己心坎里，像一只鹰在平原上把一头还没断奶的小白山羊抓到窠里去。在这个粉白黛绿的博物院中没有一幅属于他的画，没有一个属于他的情妇，他觉得很委屈。他想：“有一个情妇等于有了王侯的地位，有了权势的标识！”他望着特·纽沁根太太，活像一个受了侮辱的男子瞪着敌人。子爵夫人回头使了个眼色，对他的知情识趣表示不胜感激。台上第一幕刚演完。

她问阿瞿达：“你和特·纽沁根太太相熟，可以把拉斯蒂涅先生介绍给她吗？”

侯爵对欧也纳说：“哦，她一定很高兴见见你的。”

漂亮的葡萄牙人起身挽着大学生的手臂，一眨眼便到了特·纽沁根太太旁边。

“男爵夫人，”侯爵说道，“我很荣幸能够给你介绍这位欧也纳·特·拉斯蒂涅骑士，特·鲍赛昂太太的表弟。他对你印象非常深刻，我有心成全他，让他近前来瞻仰瞻仰他的偶像。”

这些话多少带点打趣和唐突的口吻，可是经过一番巧妙的掩饰，永远不会使一个女人讨厌。特·纽沁根太太微微一笑，把丈夫刚走开而留下的座位让欧也纳坐了。

她说：“我不敢请你留在这儿，一个人有福分跟特·鲍赛昂太太在一起，是不肯走开的。”

“可是，太太，”欧也纳低声回答，“如果我要讨表姊的欢心，恐怕就该留在你身边。”他又提高嗓子：“侯爵来到之前，我们正谈着你，谈着你大方高雅的风度。”

特·阿瞿达先生抽身告辞了。

“真的，先生，你留在我这儿吗？”男爵夫人说，“那我们可以相熟了，家姊和我提过你，真是久仰得很！”

“那么她真会作假，她早已把我挡驾了。”

“怎么呢？”

“太太，我应当把原因告诉你；不过要说出这样一桩秘密，先得求你包涵。我是令尊大人的邻居，当初不知道特·雷斯多太太是他的女儿。我无意中，冒冒失失提了一句，把令姊和令姊夫得罪了。你真想不到，特·朗日公爵夫人和我的表姊，认为这种背弃父亲的行为多么不合体统。我告诉她们经过情形，她们笑坏了。特·鲍赛昂太太把你同令姊做比较，说了你许多好话，说你待高里奥先生十分孝顺。真是，你怎么能不孝顺他呢？他那样地疼你，叫我看了忌妒。今儿早上我和令尊大人谈了你两小时。刚才陪表姊吃饭的时候，我脑子里还装满了令尊的那番话，我对表姊说，我不相信你的美貌能够跟你的好心相比。大概看到我对你这样仰慕，特·鲍赛昂太太才特意带我上这儿来，以她那种惯有的殷勤对我说，我可以有机会碰到你。”

“先生，”银行家太太说，“承你的情，我感激得很。不久我们就能成为老朋友了。”

“你说的友谊固然不是泛泛之交，我可永远不愿意做你的朋友。”

初出茅庐的人这套印版式的话，女人听了总很舒服，唯有冷静的头脑才会觉得这话空洞贫乏。一个青年人的举动、音调、目光，使那些废话变得有声有色。特·纽沁根太太觉得拉斯蒂涅风流潇洒。她像所有的女子一样，没法回答大学生那些单刀直入的话，扯到旁的事情上去了。

“是的，姊姊对可怜的父亲很不好。他却是像上帝一样地疼我们。特·纽沁根先生只许我在白天接待父亲，我没有法儿才让步的。可是我为此难过了多少时候，哭了多少回。除了平时虐待之外，这种霸道也是破坏我们夫妇生活的一个原因。旁人看我是巴黎最幸福的女子，实际却是最痛苦的。我对你说这些话，你一定以为我疯了。可是你认识我父亲，不能算外人了。”

“噢！”欧也纳回答，“像我这样愿意把身心一齐捧给你的人，你永远不会碰到第二个。你不是要求幸福么？”他用那种直扣心弦的声音说。“啊！如果女人的幸福是要有人爱，有人疼；有一个知己可以诉说心中的欲望、梦想、悲哀、喜悦；把自己的心，把可爱的缺点和美妙的优点一齐显露出来，不怕被人拿去利用；那么请相信我，这颗赤诚的心只能在一个年轻的男子身上找到，因为他有无穷的幻想，只消你有一点儿暗示，他便为你赴汤蹈火；他还不知道天高地厚，也不想知道，因为你便是他整个的世界。我啊，请不要笑我幼稚，我刚从偏僻的外省来，不懂世故，只认识一般心灵优美的人；我没有想到什么爱情。承我的表姊瞧得起，把我看作心腹；从她那儿我才体会到热情的宝贵；既然没有一个女人好让我献身，我就像薛侣班[22]一样爱慕所有的女人。可是我刚才进来一看见你，便像触电似的被你吸住了。我想你已经想了好久！可做梦也想不到你会这样的美。特·鲍赛昂太太叫我别尽瞧着你，她可不知道你美丽的红唇，洁白的皮色，温柔的眼睛，叫人没有法子不看。你瞧，我也对你说了许多疯话，可是请你让我说吧。”

女人最喜欢这些絮絮叨叨的甜言蜜语，连最古板的妇女也会听进去，即使她们不应该回答。这么一开场，拉斯蒂涅又放低声音，说了一大堆体己话；特·纽沁根太太的笑容明明在鼓励他。她不时对特·迦拉蒂沃纳公主包厢里的特·玛赛瞟上一眼。拉斯蒂涅陪着特·纽沁根太太，直到她丈夫来找她回去的时候。

“太太，”欧也纳说，“在特·加里里阿诺公爵夫人的舞会之前，我希望能够去拜访你。”

“既然内人请了你，她一定欢迎你的。”特·纽沁根男爵说。一看这个臃肿的亚尔萨斯人的大圆脸，你就知道他老奸巨猾。

特·鲍赛昂太太站起来预备和阿瞿达一同走了。欧也纳一边过去作别，一边想：“事情进行得不错；我对她说‘你能不能爱我？’她并不怎么吃惊。缰绳已经扣好，只要跳上去就行了。”他不知道男爵夫人根本心不在焉，正在等特·玛赛的一封信，一封令人心碎的决裂的信。欧也纳误会了这意思，以为自己得手了，满心欢喜，陪子爵夫人走到戏院外边的廊下，大家都在那儿等车。

欧也纳走后，阿瞿达对子爵夫人笑着说：“你的表弟简直换了一个人。他要冲进银行去了。看他像鳗鱼一般灵活，我相信他会抖起来的。也只有你会教他挑中一个正需要安慰的女人。”

“可是，”特·鲍赛昂太太回答，“先得知道她还爱不爱丢掉她的那一个。”

欧也纳从意大利剧院走回圣·日内维新街，一路打着如意算盘。他刚才发现特·雷斯多太太注意他，不管他在子爵夫人的包厢里，还是在特·纽沁根太太包厢里，他料定从此那位伯爵夫人不会再把他挡驾了。他也预算一定能够讨元帅夫人喜欢，这样他在巴黎高等社会的中心就有了四个大户人家好来往。他已经懂得，虽然还不知道用什么方法，在这个复杂的名利场中，必须抓住一个机钮，才能高高在上地控制机器；而他自问的确有教轮子搁浅的力量。“倘若特·纽沁根太太对我有意，我会教她怎样控制她的丈夫。那家伙是做银钱生意的，可以帮我一下子发一笔大财。”这些念头，他并没想得这样露骨，他还不够老练，不能把局势看清，估计，细细地筹划；他的主意只像轻云一般在天空飘荡，虽没有伏脱冷的计划狠毒，可是放在良心的坩埚内熔化之下，也未必能提出多少纯粹的分子了。一般人就是从这一类的交易开始，终于廉耻荡然，而今日社会上也相习成风，恬不为怪。方正清白，意志坚强，疾恶如仇，认为稍出常规便是罪大恶极的人物，在现代比任何时代都寥落了。过去有两部杰作代表这等清白的性格，一是莫里哀的《阿赛斯德》，一是比较晚近的瓦尔特·司各特的《丁斯父女》。也许性质相反的作品，把一个上流人物，一个野心家如何抹杀良心，走邪路，装了伪君子而达到目的，曲曲折折描写下来，会一样的美，一样的动人心魄。

拉斯蒂涅走到公寓门口，已经对纽沁根太太着了迷，觉得她身段窈窕，像燕子一样轻巧。令人心醉的眼睛，仿佛看得见血管而像丝织品一样细腻的皮肤，迷人的声音，金黄的头发，他都一一回想起来；也许他走路的时候全身的血活动了，使脑海中的形象格外富于诱惑性。他粗手粗脚地敲着高老头的房门，喊：

“喂，邻居，我见过但斐纳太太了。”

“在哪儿？”

“意大利剧院。”

“她玩得怎么样？请进来喔。”老人没穿好衣服就起来开了门，赶紧睡下。

“跟我说呀，她怎么样？”他紧跟着问。

欧也纳还是第一次走进高老头的屋子。欣赏过女儿的装束，再看到父亲住的丑地方，他不由得做了个出惊的姿势。窗上没有帘子，糊壁纸好几处受了潮气而脱落，卷缩，露出煤烟熏黄的石灰。老头儿躺在破床上，只有一条薄被，压脚的棉花毯是用伏盖太太的旧衣衫缝的。地砖潮湿，全是灰。窗子对面，一口旧红木柜子，带一点儿鼓形，铜拉手是蔓藤和花叶纠结在一处的形状；一个木板面子的洗脸架，放着脸盆和水壶，旁边是全套剃胡子用具。壁角放着几双鞋；床头小几，底下没有门，面上没有云石；壁炉没有生过火的痕迹，旁边摆一张胡桃木方桌，高老头毁掉镀金盘子就是利用桌上的横档。一口破书柜上放着高老头的帽子。这套破烂家具还包括两把椅子，一张草垫陷下去的大靠椅。红白方格的粗布床幔，用一条破布吊在天花板上。便是最穷的掮客住的阁楼，家具也比高老头在伏盖家用的好一些。你看到这间屋子会身上发冷，胸口发闷；像监狱里阴惨惨的牢房。幸而高老头没有留意欧也纳把蜡烛放在床几上时的表情。他翻了个身，把被窝一直盖到下巴颏儿。

“哎，你说，两姊妹你喜欢哪一个？”

“我喜欢但斐纳太太，”大学生回答，“因为她对你更孝顺。”

听了这句充满感情的话，老人从床上伸出胳膊，握着欧也纳的手，很感动地说：

“多谢多谢，她对你说我什么来着？”

大学生把男爵夫人的话背了一遍，渲染一番，老头儿好像听着上帝的圣旨。

“好孩子！是呀，是呀，她很爱我啊。可是别相信她说阿娜斯大齐的话，姊妹俩为了我彼此忌妒，你明白吗？这更加证明她们的孝心。娜齐也很爱我，我知道的。父亲对儿女，就跟上帝对咱们一样。他会钻到孩子们的心底里去，看他们存心怎么样。她们两人心地一样好。噢！要再有两个好女婿，不是太幸福了吗？世界上没有全福的。倘若我住在她们一起，只要听到她们的声音，知道她们在那儿，看到她们走进走出，像从前在我身边一样，那我简直乐死了。她们穿得漂亮吗？”

“漂亮。可是，高里奥先生，既然你女儿都嫁得这么阔，你怎么还住在这样一个贫民窟里？”

“嘿，”他装作满不在乎的神气说，“我住得再好有什么相干？这些事情我竟说不上来；我不能接连说两句有头有尾的话。总而言之，一切都在这儿，”他拍了拍心窝，“我么，我的生活都在两个女儿身上。只要她们能玩儿，快快活活，穿得好，住得好；我穿什么衣服，睡什么地方，有什么相干？反正她们暖和了，我就不觉得冷；她们笑了，我就不会心烦；只有她们伤心了我才伤心。你有朝一日做了父亲，听见孩子们嘁嘁喳喳，你心里就会想：‘这是从我身上出来的！’你觉得这些小生命每滴血都是你的血，是你的血的精华——不是么！甚至你觉得跟她们的皮肉连在一块儿，她们走路，你自己也在动作。无论哪儿都有她们的声音在答应我。她们眼神有点儿不快活，我的血就冻了。你终有一天知道，为了她们的快乐而快乐，比你自己快乐更快乐。我不能向你解释这个，只能说心里有那么一股劲，教你浑身舒畅。总之，我一个人过着三个人的生活。我再告诉你一件古怪事儿好不好？我做了父亲，才懂得上帝。他无处不在，既然世界是从他来的。先生，我对女儿便是这样的无处不在。不过我爱我的女儿，还胜过上帝爱人类；因为人不像上帝一样的美，我的女儿却比我美得多。我跟她们永远心贴着的，所以我早就预感到，你今晚会碰到她们。天哪！要是有个男人使我的小但斐纳快活，把真正的爱情给她，那我可以替那个男人擦靴子，跑腿。我从她老妈子那里知道，特·玛赛那小子是条恶狗，我有时真想扭断他的脖子。哼，他竟不知道爱一个无价之宝的女人，夜莺般的声音，生得像天仙一样！只怪她没有眼睛，嫁了个亚尔萨斯死胖子。姊妹俩都要俊俏温柔的后生才配得上；可是她们的丈夫都是她们自己挑的。”

那时高老头伟大极了。欧也纳从没见过他表现那种慈父的热情。感情有股熏陶的力量；一个人不论如何粗俗，只要表现出一股真实而强烈的情感，就有种特殊的气息，使容貌为之改观，举动有生气，声音有音色。往往最蠢的家伙，在热情鼓动之下，即使不能在言语上，至少能在思想上达到雄辩的境界，他仿佛在光明的领域内活动。那时老人的声音举止，感染力不下于名演员。归根结底，我们优美的感情不就是意志的表现么？

“告诉你，”欧也纳道，“她大概要跟特·玛赛分手了，你听了高兴吗？那花花公子丢下她去追迦拉蒂沃纳公主。至于我，我今晚已经爱上了但斐纳太太。”

“哦！”高老头叫着。

“是呀。她并不讨厌我。咱们谈情谈了一小时，后天星期六我要去看她。”

“哦！亲爱的先生，倘使她喜欢你，我也要喜欢你呢！你心肠好，不会给她受罪。你要欺骗她，我就割掉你的脑袋。一个女人一生只爱一次，你知道不知道？天！我尽说傻话，欧也纳先生。你在这儿冷得很。哎啊！你跟她谈过话喽，她教你对我说些什么呢？”

“一句话也没有。”欧也纳心里想，可是他高声回答：“她告诉我，说她很亲热地拥抱你。”

“再见吧，邻居。希望你睡得好，做好梦。凭你刚才那句话，我就会做好梦了。上帝保佑你万事如意！今晚你简直是我的好天使，我在你身上闻到了女儿的气息。”

欧也纳睡下时想道：“可怜的老头儿，哪怕铁石心肠也得被他感动呢。他的女儿可一点没有想到他，当他外人一样。”

自从这次谈话以后，高老头把他的邻居看作一个朋友，一个意想不到的心腹。他们的关系完全建筑在老人的父爱上面；没有这一点，高老头跟谁也不会亲近的。痴情汉的计算从来不会错误。因为欧也纳受到但斐纳的重视，高老头便觉得跟这个女儿更亲近了些，觉得她对自己的确更好一些。并且他已经把这个女儿的痛苦告诉欧也纳，他每天都要祝福一次的但斐纳从来没有得到甜蜜的爱情。照他的说法，欧也纳是他遇到的最可爱的青年，他也似乎预感到，欧也纳能给但斐纳从来未有的快乐。所以老人对邻居的友谊一天天地增加，要不然，我们就无从得知这件故事的终局了。

第二天，高老头在饭桌上不大自然地瞧着欧也纳的神气，和他说的几句话，平时同石膏像一样而此刻完全改变了的面容，使同住的人大为奇怪。伏脱冷从密谈以后还是初次见到大学生，似乎想猜透他的心思。隔夜睡觉之前，欧也纳曾经把眼前阔大的天地估量一番，此刻记起伏脱冷的计划，自然联想到泰伊番小姐的陪嫁，不由得瞧着维多莉，正如一个极规矩的青年瞧一个有钱的闺女。碰巧两人的眼睛遇在一块。可怜的姑娘当然觉得欧也纳穿了新装挺可爱。双方的目光意义深长，拉斯蒂涅肯定自己已经成为她心目中的对象；少女们不是都有些模糊的欲望，碰到第一个迷人的男子就想求得满足吗？欧也纳听见有个声音在耳边叫：“八十万！八十万！”可是又突然想到隔夜的事，认为自己对纽沁根太太别有用心的热情，确乎是一贴解毒剂，可以压制他不由自主的邪念。

他说：“昨天意大利剧院演唱洛西尼的《塞维勒的理发师》，我从没听过那么美的音乐。喝！在意大利剧院有个包厢多舒服！”

高老头听了，马上竖起耳朵，仿佛一条狗看到了主人的动作。

“你们真开心，”伏盖太太说，“你们男人爱怎么玩儿就怎么玩儿。”

“你怎么回来的？”伏脱冷问。

“走回来的。”

“哼，”伏脱冷说，“要玩就得玩个痛快。我要坐自己的车，上自己的包厢，舒舒服服地回来。要就全套，不就拉倒！这是我的口号。”

“这才对啦。”伏盖太太凑上一句。

“你要到特·纽沁根太太家去吧，”欧也纳低声对高里奥说，“她一定很高兴看到你，会向你打听我许多事。我知道她一心希望我的表姊特·鲍赛昂子爵夫人招待她。你不妨告诉她，说我太爱她了，一定使她满足。”

拉斯蒂涅赶紧上学校，觉得在这所怕人的公寓里耽得越少越好。他差不多闲荡了一整天，头里热烘烘的，像抱着热烈的希望的年轻人一样。他在卢森堡公园内从伏脱冷的议论想开去，想到社会和人生，忽然碰到他的朋友皮安训。

“你干吗一本正经地板着脸？”医学生说着，抓着他的胳膊往卢森堡宫前面走去。

“脑子里尽想些坏念头，苦闷得很。”

“什么坏念头？那也可以治啊。”

“怎么治？”

“只要屈服就行了。”

“你不知道怎么回事，只管打哈哈。你念过卢梭没有？”

“念过。”

“他著作里有一段，说倘使身在巴黎，能够单凭一念之力，在中国杀掉一个年老的满大人[23]，因此发财；读者打算怎么办？你可记得？”

“记得。”

“那么你怎么办？”

“噢！满大人我已经杀了好几打了。”

“说正经话，如果真有这样的事，只消你点点头就行，你干不干？”

“那满大人是不是老得很了？呃，老也罢，少也罢，痨病也罢，健康也罢，我吗，吓！我不干。”

“你是个好人，皮安训。不过要是你爱上一个女人，爱得你肯把灵魂翻身，而你非得有钱，有很多的钱，供给她衣着、车马，满足她一切想入非非的欲望，那你怎么办？”

“嗳，你拿走了我的理性，还要我用理性来思想！”

“皮安训，我疯了，你把我治一治吧。我有两个妹子，又美又纯洁的天使，我要她们幸福。从今起五年之间，哪儿去弄二十万法郎给她们做陪嫁？你瞧，人生有些关口非大手大脚赌一下不可，不能为了混口苦饭吃而蹉跎了幸福。”

“每个人踏进社会的时候都遇到这种问题。而你想快刀斩乱麻，马上成功。朋友，要这样干，除非有亚历山大那样的雄才大略，要不然你会坐牢。我么，我情愿将来在外省过平凡的生活，老老实实接替父亲的位置。在最小的小圈子里，跟在最大的大环境里，感情同样可以得到满足。拿破仑吃不了两顿晚饭，他的情妇也不能比加波桑医院的实习医生多几个。咱们的幸福，朋友，离不了咱们的肉体；幸福的代价每年一百万也罢，两千法郎也罢，实际的感觉总是那么回事。所以我不想要那个中国人的性命。”

“谢谢你，皮安训，我听了你的话怪舒服。咱们永远是好朋友。”

“喂，”医学生说，“我刚才在植物园上完居维哀[24]的课出来，看见米旭诺和波阿莱坐在一张凳上，同一个男人谈话。去年国会附近闹事的时候，我见过那家伙，很像一个暗探，冒充靠利息过活的布尔乔亚。你把米旭诺和波阿莱研究一下吧，以后我再告诉你为什么。再见，我要去上四点钟的课了。”

欧也纳回到公寓，高老头正等着他。

“你瞧，”那老人说，“她有信给你。你看她那一笔字多好！”

欧也纳拆开信来。


“先生，家严说你喜欢意大利音乐，如果你肯赏光驾临我的包厢，我将非常欣幸。星期六我们可以听到福杜和班莱葛里尼[25]，相信你不会拒绝的。特·纽沁根先生和我，一致请你到舍间来用便饭。倘蒙俯允，他将大为高兴，因为他可以摆脱丈夫的苦役，不必再陪我上戏院了。无须赐复，但候光临，并请接受我的敬意。D.N.”



欧也纳念完了信，老人说：“给我瞧瞧。”他嗅了嗅信纸又道，“你一定去的，是不是？嗯，好香！那是她手指碰过的啊！”

欧也纳私下想：“照理女人不会这样进攻男人的。她大概想利用我来挽回特·玛赛，心中有了怨恨才会做出这种事来。”

“喂，你想什么呀？”高老头问。

欧也纳不知道某些女子的虚荣简直像发狂一样，为了踏进圣·日耳曼区阀阅世家的大门，一个银行家的太太做什么牺牲都肯。那时的风气，能出入圣·日耳曼区贵族社会的妇女，被认为高人一等。大家把那个社会的人叫作小王宫的太太们，领袖群伦的便是特·鲍赛昂太太、特·朗日公爵夫人、特·莫弗利纽斯公爵夫人。唐打区的妇女想挤进那个群星照耀的高等社会的狂热，只有拉斯蒂涅一个人不曾得知。但他对但斐纳所存的戒心，对他不无好处，因为他能保持冷静，能够向人家提出条件而不至于接受人家的条件。

“噢！是的，我一定去。”欧也纳回答高老头。

因此他是存着好奇心去看纽沁根太太，要是那女的瞧他不起，他反而要为了热情冲动而去了。虽然如此，他还是心焦得很，巴不得明天出发的时间快点儿来到。青年人初次弄手段也许和初恋一样甜蜜。胜券可操的把握使人喜悦不尽，这种喜悦男人并不承认，可是的确造成某些妇女的魅力。容易成功和难于成功同样能刺激人的欲望。两者都是引起或者培养男子的热情的。爱情世界也就是分成这两大阵地。也许这个分野是气质促成的，因为气质支配着人与人的关系。忧郁的人需要女子若即若离的卖弄风情来提神；而神经质或多血质的人碰到女子抵抗太久了，说不定会掉头不顾。换句话说，哀歌主要是淋巴质的表现，正如颂歌是胆质的表现。[26]

欧也纳一边装扮，一边体味那些小小的乐趣，青年们怕人取笑，一般都不敢提到这种得意，可是虚荣心特别感到满足。他梳头发的时候，想到一个漂亮女子的目光会在他漆黑的头发卷中打转。他做出许多怪模怪样，活像一个更衣去赴跳舞会的小姑娘。他解开上衣，沾沾自喜地瞧着自己的细腰身，心上想：“当然，不如我的还多呢！”公寓中全班人马正围着桌子吃饭，他下楼了，喜洋洋地受到众人喝彩。看见一个人穿扮齐整而大惊小怪，也是包饭公寓的一种风气。有人穿一套新衣，每个人就得开声口。

“嘚，嘚，嘚，嘚，”皮安训把舌头抵着上颚作响，好似催马快走一般。

“吓！好一个王孙公子的派头！”伏盖太太道。

“先生是去会情人吧？”米旭诺小姐表示意见。

“怪样子！”画家嚷道。

“候候你太太。”博物院管事说。

“先生有太太了？”波阿莱问。

“柜子里的太太，好走水路，包不褪色，二十五法郎起码，四十法郎为止，新式花样，不怕冲洗，上好质地，半丝线，半棉料，半羊毛，包医牙痛，包治王家学会钦定的疑难杂症！对小娃娃尤其好，头痛，充血，食道病，眼病，耳病，特别灵验。”伏脱冷用滑稽的急口令，和江湖卖艺的腔调叫着，“这件妙物要多少钱看一看呀？两个铜子吗？不，完全免费。那是替蒙古大皇帝造的，全欧洲的国王都要瞧一眼的！大家来吧！向前走，买票房在前面，喂，奏乐，勃龙，啦，啦，脱冷！啦，啦，蓬！蓬！喂，吹小笛子的，你把音吹走了，等我来揍你！”

“天哪！这个人多好玩，”伏盖太太对古的太太说，“有他在一块儿永远不觉得无聊。”

正在大家说笑打诨的时候，欧也纳发觉泰伊番小姐偷偷瞅了他一眼，咬了咬古的太太的耳朵。

西尔维道：“车来了。”

皮安训问：“他上哪儿吃饭呀？”

“特·纽沁根男爵夫人家里。”

“高里奥先生的女儿府上。”大学生补上一句。

大家的目光转向老面条商，老面条商不胜艳羡地瞧着欧也纳。

拉斯蒂涅到了圣·拉查街。一座轻巧的屋子，十足地道的银行家住宅，单薄的廊柱，毫无气派的回廊，就是巴黎的所谓漂亮。不惜工本的讲究，人造云石的装饰，五彩云石镶嵌的楼梯台。小客厅挂满意大利油画，装饰像咖啡馆。男爵夫人愁容满面而勉强掩饰的神气不是假装的，欧也纳看了大为关心。他自以为一到就能叫一个女人快乐，不料她竟是愁眉不展。这番失望刺激了他的自尊心。他把她心事重重的神色打趣了一番，说道：

“太太，我没有资格要你信任我。要是我打搅你，请你老实说。”

“哦！你别走。你一走就剩我一个人在家了。纽沁根在外边应酬，我不愿意孤零零地待在这儿。我闷得慌，需要散散心才好。”

“有什么事呢？”

她道：“绝对不能告诉你。”

“我就想知道，就想参加你的秘密。”

“或许……”她马上改口道，“噢，不行。夫妇之间的争吵应当深深地埋在心里。前天我不是跟你提过吗？我一点不快活。黄金的枷锁是最重的。”

一个女人在一个青年面前说她苦恼，而如果这青年聪明伶俐，服装齐整，袋里有着一千五百法郎闲钱的话，他就会像欧也纳一般想法而得意扬扬了。

欧也纳回答：“你又美又年轻，又有钱又有爱情，还要什么呢？”

“我的事不用提了。”她沉着脸摇摇头，“等会我们一块儿吃饭，就是我们两个。吃过饭去听最美的音乐。”她站起身子，抖了抖白开司棉的衣衫，绣着富丽的波斯图案，问：“你觉得我怎么样？”

“可爱极了，我要你整个儿属于我呢。”

“那你倒霉了，”她苦笑道，“这儿你一点看不出苦难；可是尽管有这样的外表，我苦闷到极点，整夜睡不着觉，我要变得难看了。”

大学生道：“哦！不会的。可是我很想知道，究竟是什么痛苦连至诚的爱情都消除不了？”

她说：“告诉你，你就要躲开了。你喜欢我，不过是男人对女人表面上的殷勤；真爱我的话，你会马上痛苦得要死。所以我不应该说出来。咱们谈旁的事吧。来，瞧瞧我的屋子。”

“不，还是留在这儿。”欧也纳说着，挨着特·纽沁根太太坐在壁炉前面一张双人椅里，大胆抓起她的手来。

她让他拿着，还用力压他的手，表示她心中骚动得厉害。

“听我说，”拉斯蒂涅道，“你要有什么伤心事儿，就得告诉我。我要向你证明，我是为爱你而爱你的。你得把痛苦对我说，让我替你出力，哪怕要杀几个人都可以；要不我就一去不回地走了。”

她忽然想起一个无可奈何的念头，拍拍额角，说道：“嗳，好，让我立刻来试你一试。”

她心上想：“是的，除此以外也没有办法了。”她打铃叫人。

“先生的车可是套好了？”她问当差。

“套好了，太太。”

“我要用。让他用我的车吧。等七点钟再开饭。”

“喂，来吧。”她招呼欧也纳。

欧也纳坐在特·纽沁根先生的车里陪着这位太太，觉得像做梦一样。

她吩咐车夫：“到王宫市场，靠近法兰西剧院。”

一路上她心绪不宁，也不搭理欧也纳无数的问话。他弄不明白那种沉默的、痴呆的、一味撑拒的态度是什么意思。

“一眨眼就抓不住她了。”他想。

车子停下的时候，男爵夫人瞪着大学生的神色使他住了嘴，不敢再胡说八道，因为那时他已经控制不了自己。

“你是不是很爱我？”她问。

“是的。”他强作镇静地回答。

“不论我叫你干什么，你不会看轻我吗？”

“不会。”

“你愿意听我指挥吗？”

“连眼睛都不睁一睁。”

“你有没有上过赌场？”她的声音发抖了。

“从来没有。”

她说：“啊！我放心了。你的运道一定好。我荷包里有一百法郎；一个这么幸福的女子，全部财产就是这一点。你拿着到赌场去，我不知道在哪儿，反正靠近王宫市场。你把这一百法郎去押轮盘赌，要就输光了回来，要就替我赢六千法郎。等你回来，我再把痛苦说给你听。”

“我现在要去做的事我一点都不懂，可是我一定照办。”他回答的口气很高兴，他暗暗地想：“教我干了这种事，她什么都不会拒绝我了。”

欧也纳揣着美丽的钱袋，向一个卖旧衣服的商人问了最近的赌场地址，找到九号门牌，奔上楼去。侍者接过他的帽子，他走进屋子问轮盘在哪儿。一般老赌客好不诧异地瞧着他由侍者领到一张长桌前面，又听见他大大方方地问，赌注放在什么地方。

一个体面的白发老人告诉他：“三十六门随你押，押中了，一赔三十六。”

欧也纳想到自己的年龄，把一百法郎押在二十一的数字上。他还来不及定一定神，只听见一声惊喊，已经中了。

那老先生对他说：“把钱收起来吧，这个玩意儿决不能连赢两回的。”

欧也纳接过老人授给他的耙，把三千六百法郎拨到身边。他始终不明白这赌博的性质，又连本带利押在红上。[27]周围的人看他继续赌下去，很眼痒地望着他。轮盘一转，他又赢了，庄家赔了他三千六百法郎。

老先生咬着他的耳朵说：“你有了七千二百法郎了。你要是相信我，你赶快走。今儿红已经出了八次。倘使你肯酬谢我的忠告，希望你发发善心，救济我一下。我是拿破仑的旧部，当过州长，现在潦倒了。”

拉斯蒂涅糊里糊涂让白发老头拿了两百法郎，自己揣着七千法郎下楼。他对这个玩意儿还是一窍不通，只奇怪自己的好运道。

他等车门关上，把七千法郎捧给特·纽沁根太太，说道：“哎哟！你现在又要带我上哪儿啦？”

但斐纳发疯似的搂着他，拥抱他，兴奋得不得了，可不是爱情的表现。

“你救了我！”她说，快乐的眼泪簌落落地淌了一脸，“让我统统告诉你吧，朋友。你会和我做朋友的是不是？你看我有钱，阔绰，什么都不缺，至少在表面上。唉！你怎知道纽沁根连一个子儿都不让我支配！他只管家里的开销，我的车子和包厢。可是他给的衣着费是不够的，他有心逼得我一个钱都没有。我太高傲了，不愿意央求他。要他的钱，就得依他的条件；要是接受那些条件，我简直算不得人了。我自己有七十万财产，怎么会让他剥削到这步田地？为了高傲，为了气愤。刚结婚的时候，我们那么年轻那么天真！向丈夫讨钱的话，说出来仿佛要撕破嘴巴；我始终不敢出口，只能花着我的积蓄和可怜的父亲给我的钱；后来我只能借债。结婚对我是最可怕的骗局，我没法跟你说；只消告诉你一句：要不是我和纽沁根各有各的屋子，我竟会跳楼。为了首饰，为了满足我的欲望所欠的债，（可怜的父亲把我们宠惯了，一向要什么有什么，）要对丈夫说出来的时候，我真是受难，可是我终于迸足勇气说了。我不是有自己的一份财产吗？纽沁根却大生其气，说我要使他倾家荡产了，一大串的混账话，我听了恨不得钻入地下。当然，他得了我的陪嫁，临了不能不替我还债；可是从此以后把我的零用限了一个数目，我为了求个太平也就答应了。从那时起，我满足了那个男人的虚荣心，你知道我说的是谁。即使我被他骗了，我还得说句公道话，他的性格是高尚的。可是他终于狠心地把我丢了！男人给过一个遭难的女子大把的金钱，永远不应该抛弃她！应当永远爱她！你只有二十一岁，高尚，纯洁，你或许要问：一个女人怎么能接受一个男人的钱呢？唉，天哪！同一个使我们幸福的人有难同当，有福同享，不是挺自然的吗？把自己整个地给了人，还会顾虑这整个中间的一小部分吗？只有感情消灭之后，金钱才成为问题。两人不是海誓山盟，生死不渝的吗？自以为有人疼爱的时候，谁想到有分手的一天？既然你们发誓说你们的爱是永久的，干吗再在金钱上分得那么清？你不知道我今天怎样的难受，纽沁根斩钉截铁地拒绝给我六千法郎，可是他按月就得送这样一笔数目给他的情妇，一个歌剧院的歌女。我想自杀，转过最疯狂的念头。有时我竟羡慕一个女用人，羡慕我的老妈子。找父亲去吗？发疯！阿娜斯大齐和我已经把他榨干了；可怜的父亲，只要他能值六千法郎，他把自己出卖都愿意。现在我只能使他干急一阵。想不到你救了我，救了我的面子，救了我的性命。那时，我痛苦得糊里糊涂了。唉，先生，我不能不对你做这番解释，我简直疯了，才会教你去做那样的事。刚才你走了以后，我真想走下车子逃……逃哪儿去？我不知道。巴黎的妇女半数就是过的这种生活：表面上穷奢极侈，暗里心事担得要死。我认得一般可怜虫比我更苦。有的不得不叫铺子开花账，有的不得不偷盗丈夫；有些丈夫以为两千法郎的开司棉只值五百，有的以为五百法郎的开司棉值到两千。还有一般可怜的妇女教儿女挨饿，好搜括些零钱做件衣衫。我可从没干过这些下流的骗局。这次是我最后一次的苦难了。有些女人为了控制丈夫，不惜把自己卖给丈夫，我至少是自由的！我很可以教纽沁根在我身上堆满黄金，可是我宁愿伏在一个我敬重的男人怀里痛哭。啊！今晚上特·玛赛再不能把我看作他出钱厮养的女人了。”

她双手捧着脸，不让欧也纳看见她哭。他却拿掉她的手，细细瞧着她，觉得她庄严极了。

她说：“把金钱和爱情混在一块儿，不是丑恶极了吗？你不会爱我的了。”

使女人显得多么伟大的好心，现在的社会组织逼她们犯的过失，两者交错之下，使欧也纳心都乱了。他一边用好话安慰她，一边暗暗赞叹这个美丽的女子，她的痛苦的呼号竟会那么天真那么冒失。

她说：“你将来不会拿这个来要挟我吧？你得答应我。”

“嗳，太太，我不是这等人。”

她又感激又温柔地拿他的手放在心口：“你使我恢复了自由、快乐。过去我老受着威胁。从此我要生活朴素，不乱花钱了。你一定喜欢我这么办是不是？这一部分你留着，”她自己只拿六张钞票，“我还欠你三千法郎，因为我觉得要跟你平分才对。”

欧也纳像小姑娘一样再三推辞。男爵夫人说：“你要不肯做我的同党，我就把你当作敌人。”他只得收下，说道：“好，那么我留着以防不测吧。”

“噢！我就怕听这句话，”她脸色发白地说，“你要瞧得起我，千万别再上赌场。我的天！由我来教坏你！那我要难受死哩。”

他们回到家里。苦难与奢华的对比，大学生看了头脑昏昏沉沉，伏脱冷那些可怕的话又在耳朵里响起来了。

男爵夫人走进卧室，指着壁炉旁边一张长靠椅说：“你坐一会儿，我要写一封极难措辞的信。你替我出点儿主意吧。”

“干脆不用写。把钞票装入信封，写上地址，派你老妈子送去就行了。”

“哦！你真是一个宝贝。这便叫作有教养！这是十足地道的鲍赛昂作风。”她笑着说。

“她多可爱！”越来越着迷的欧也纳想。他瞧了瞧卧房，奢侈的排场活像一个有钱的交际花的屋子。

“你喜欢这屋子吗？”她一边打铃一边问。

“丹兰士，把这封信当面交给特·玛赛先生。他要不在家，原封带回。”

丹兰士临走把大学生俏皮地瞅了一眼。晚饭开出了，拉斯蒂涅让特·纽沁根太太挽着手臂带到一间精致的饭厅，在表姊家瞻仰过的讲究的饮食，在这儿又见识了一次。

“逢着意大利剧院演唱的日子，你就来吃饭，陪我上剧院。”

“这种甜蜜的生活要能长久下去，真是太美了；可怜我是一个清寒的学生，还得挣一份家业咧。”

“你一定成功的，”她笑道，“你瞧，一切都有办法；我就想不到自己会这样快活。”

女人的天性喜欢用可能来证明不可能，用预感来取消事实。特·纽沁根太太和拉斯蒂涅走进意大利剧院包厢的时候，她心满意足，容光焕发，使每个人看了都能造些小小的谣言，非但女人没法防卫，而且会教人相信那些凭空捏造的放荡生活确有其事。直要你认识巴黎之后，才知道大家说的并不是事实，而事实是大家不说的。欧也纳握着男爵夫人的手，两人用握手的松紧代替谈话，交换他们听了音乐以后的感觉。这是他们俩销魂荡魄的一晚。他们一同离开剧院，特·纽沁根太太把欧也纳送到新桥，一路在车中挣扎，不肯把她在王宫市场那么热烈的亲吻再给他一个。欧也纳埋怨她前后矛盾，她回答说：

“刚才是感激那个意想不到的恩惠，现在却是一种许愿了。”

“而你就不肯许一个愿，没良心的！”

他恼了。于是她伸出手来，不耐烦的姿势使情人愈加动心；而他捧了手亲吻时不大乐意的神气，她也看了很得意。她说：

“星期一跳舞会上见！”

欧也纳踏着月光回去，开始一本正经地思索。他又喜又恼：喜的是这桩奇遇大概会给他钓上一个巴黎最漂亮最风流的女子，正好是他心目中的对象；恼的是他的发财计划完全给推翻了。他前天迷迷糊糊想的主意，此刻才觉得自己真有这么个念头。一个人要失败之后，方始发觉他欲望的强烈。欧也纳越享受巴黎生活，越不肯自甘贫贱。他把袋里一千法郎的钞票捻来捻去，找出无数自欺欺人的理由想据为己有。终于他到了圣·日内维新街，走完楼梯，看见有灯光。高老头虚掩着房门，点着蜡烛，使大学生不致忘记跟他谈谈他的女儿。欧也纳毫无隐瞒地全说了。

高老头妒忌到极点，说道：“嗳，她们以为我完了，我可还有一千三百法郎利息呢！可怜的孩子，怎么不到我这儿来！我可以卖掉存款，在本钱上拿一笔款子出来，余下的钱改作终身年金。干吗你不来告诉我她为难呢，我的邻居？你怎么能有那种心肠，拿她的区区一百法郎到赌台上去冒险？这简直撕破了我的心！唉，所谓女婿就是这种东西！嘿，要给我抓住了，我一定把他们勒死。天！她竟哭了吗？”

“就伏在我背心上哭的。”欧也纳回答。

“噢！把背心给我。怎么！你的背心上有我的女儿，有我心疼的但斐纳的眼泪！她小时候从来不哭的。噢！我给你买件新的吧，这一件你别穿了，给我吧。婚书上规定，她可以自由支配她的财产。我要去找诉讼代理人但尔维，明天就去。我一定要把她的财产划出来另外存放。我是懂法律的，我还能像老虎一样张牙舞爪呢。”

“喂，老丈，这是她分给我的一千法郎。你放在背心袋里，替她留着吧。”

高里奥瞪着欧也纳，伸出手来，一颗眼泪掉在欧也纳手上。

“你将来一定成功，”老人说，“你知道，上帝是赏罚分明的。我明白什么叫作诚实不欺；我敢说像你这样的人很少很少。那么你也愿意做我亲爱的孩子喽？好吧，去睡吧。你还没有做父亲，不会睡不着觉。唉，她哭了，而我，为了不肯教她们落一滴眼泪，连圣父、圣子、圣灵都会一齐出卖的人，正当她痛苦的时候，我竟若无其事在这儿吃饭，像傻瓜一样！”

欧也纳一边上床一边想：“我相信我一生都可以做个正人君子。凭良心干，的确是桩快乐的事。”

也许只有信仰上帝的人才会暗中行善，而欧也纳是信仰上帝的。

鬼上当


第二天到了舞会的时间，拉斯蒂涅到特·鲍赛昂太太家，由她带去介绍给特·加里里阿诺太太。他受到元帅夫人极殷勤的招待，又遇见了特·纽沁根太太。她特意装扮得要讨众人喜欢，以便格外讨欧也纳喜欢。她装作很镇静，暗中却是非常焦心地等欧也纳瞟她一眼。你要能猜透一个女人的情绪，那个时间便是你最快乐的时间。人家等你发表意见，你偏偏沉吟不语；明明心中高兴，你偏偏不动声色；人家为你担心，不就是承认她爱你吗？眼看她惊惶不定，然后你微微一笑加以安慰，不是最大的乐事吗？——这些玩意儿谁不喜欢来一下呢？在这次盛会中，大学生忽然看出了自己的地位，懂得以特·鲍赛昂太太公开承认的表弟资格，在上流社会中已经取得身份。大家以为他已经追上特·纽沁根太太，对他另眼相看，所有的青年都不胜艳羡地瞅着他。看到这一类的目光，他第一次体味到踌躇满志的快感。从一间客厅走到另外一间，在人丛中穿过的时候，他听见人家在夸说他的艳福。太太们预言他前程远大。但斐纳唯恐他被别人抢去，答应等会把前天坚决拒绝的亲吻给他。拉斯蒂涅在舞会中接到好几户人家邀请。表姊介绍他几位太太，都是自命风雅的人物，她们的府上也是挺有趣的交际场所。他眼看自己在巴黎最高级最漂亮的社会中露了头角。这个初次登场就大有收获的晚会，在他是到老不会忘记的，正如少女忘不了她特别走红的一个跳舞会。

第二天用早餐的时候，他把得意事儿当众讲给高老头听。伏脱冷却是狞笑了一下。

“你以为，”那个冷酷的逻辑学家叫道，“一个公子哥儿能够待在圣·日内维新街，住伏盖公寓吗？不消说，这儿在各方面看都是一个上等公寓，可绝不是时髦地方。我们这公寓殷实，富足，兴隆发达，能够做拉斯蒂涅的临时公馆非常荣幸；可是到底是圣·日内维新街，纯粹是家庭气息，不知道什么叫作奢华。我的小朋友，”伏脱冷又装出倚老卖老的挖苦的神气说，“你要在巴黎拿架子，非得有三匹马，白天有辆篷车，晚上有辆轿车，统共是九千法郎的置办费。倘若你只在成衣铺花三千法郎，香粉铺花六百法郎，鞋匠那边花三百，帽子匠那边花三百，你还大大地够不上咧。要知道光是洗衣服就得花上一千。时髦小伙子的内衣决不能马虎，那不是大众最注目的吗？爱情和教堂一样，祭坛上都要有雪白的桌布才行。这样，咱们的开销已经到一万四，还没算进打牌、赌东道、送礼等等的花费；零用少了两千法郎是不成的。这种生活，我是过来人，要多少开支，我知道得清清楚楚。除掉这些必不可少的用途，再加六千法郎伙食，一千法郎房租。嗳，孩子，这样就得两万五一年，要不就落得给人家笑话；咱们的前途，咱们的锋头，咱们的情妇，一股脑儿甭提啦！我还忘了听差跟小厮呢！难道你能教克利斯朵夫送情书吗？用你现在这种信纸写信吗？那简直是自寻死路。相信一个饱经世故的老头儿吧！”他把他的低嗓子又加强了一点，“要就躲到你清高的阁楼上去，抱着书本用功；要就另外挑一条路。”

伏脱冷说罢，睨着泰伊番小姐眼睛；这副眼神等于把他以前引诱大学生的理论重新提了一下，总结了一下。

一连多少日子，拉斯蒂涅过着花天酒地的生活，差不多天天和特·纽沁根太太一同吃饭，陪她出去交际。他早上三四点回家，中午起来梳洗，晴天陪着但斐纳去逛森林。他浪费光阴，尽量地模仿、学习，享受奢侈，其狂热正如雌枣树的花萼拼命吸收富有生殖力的花粉。他赌的输赢很大，养成了巴黎青年挥霍的习惯。他拿第一次赢来的钱寄了一千五百法郎还给母亲姊妹，加上几件精美的礼物。虽然他早已表示要离开伏盖公寓，但到正月底还待在那儿，不晓得怎么样搬出去。青年人行事的原则，初看简直不可思议，其实就因为年轻，就因为发疯似的追求快乐。那原则是：不论穷富，老是缺少必不可少的生活费，可是永远能弄到钱来满足想入非非的欲望。对一切可以赊账的东西非常阔绰，对一切现付的东西吝啬得不得了；而且因为心里想的，手头没有，似乎故意浪费手头所有的来出气。我们还可以说得更明白些：一个大学生爱惜帽子远过于爱惜衣服。成衣匠的利子厚，肯放账；帽子匠利子薄，所以是大学生不得不敷衍的最疙瘩的人。坐在戏院花楼上的小伙子，在漂亮妇女的手眼镜中尽管显出辉煌耀眼的背心，脚上的袜子是否齐备却大有问题，袜子商又是他荷包里的一条蛀虫。那时拉斯蒂涅便是这种情形。对伏盖太太老是空空如也，对虚荣的开支老是囊橐充裕；他的财源的荣枯，同最天然的开支绝不调和。为了自己的抱负，这腌臜臜的公寓常常使他觉得委屈，但要搬出去不是得付一个月的房饭钱给房东，再买套家具来装饰他花花公子的寓所吗？这笔钱就永远没有着落。拉斯蒂涅用赢来的钱买些金表金链，预备在紧要关头送进当铺，送给青年人的那个不声不响的、知趣的朋友，这是他张罗赌本的办法；但临到要付房饭钱，采办漂亮生活必不可少的工具，就一筹莫展了，胆子也没有了。日常的需要，为了衣食住行所欠的债，都不能使他触动灵机。像多数过一天算一天的人，他总要等到最后一刻，才会付清布尔乔亚认为神圣的欠账，好似米拉波[1]，非等到面包账变成可怕的借据决不清偿。那时拉斯蒂涅正把钱输光了，欠了债。大学生开始懂得，要没有固定的财源，这种生活是混不下去的。但尽管经济的压迫使他喘不过气来，他仍舍不得这种逸乐无度的生活，无论付什么代价都想维持下去。他早先假定的发财机会变了一场空梦，实际的障碍越来越大。窥到纽沁根夫妇生活的内幕之后，他发觉若要把爱情变作发财的工具，就得含垢忍辱，丢开一切高尚的念头；可是青年人的过失是全靠那些高尚的念头抵消的。表面上光华灿烂的生活，良心受着责备，片刻的欢娱都得用长时期的痛苦补赎的生活，他上了瘾了，滚在里头了，他像拉·布吕耶尔的糊涂虫一般，把自己的床位铺在泥洼里；但也像糊涂虫一样，那时还不过弄脏了衣服。[2]

“咱们的满大人砍掉了吧？”皮安训有一天离开饭桌时问他。

“还没有。可是喉咙里已经起了痰。”

医学生以为他这句话是开玩笑，其实不是的。欧也纳好久没有在公寓里吃晚饭了，这天他一路吃饭一路出神，上过点心，还不离席，挨在泰伊番小姐旁边，还不时意义深长地瞟她一眼。有几个房客还在桌上吃胡桃，有几个踱来踱去，继续谈话。大家离开饭厅的早晚，素来没有一定，看各人的心思，对谈话的兴趣，以及是否吃得过饱等等而定。在冬季，客人难得在八点以前走完；等大家散尽了，四位太太还得待一会儿，她们刚才有男客在座，不得不少说几句，此刻特意要找补一下。伏脱冷先是好像急于出去，接着注意到欧也纳满肚子心事的神气，便始终留在饭厅内欧也纳看不见的地方，欧也纳当他已经离开了。后来他也不跟最后一批房客同走，而是很狡猾地躲在客厅里。他看出大学生的心事，觉得他已经到了紧要关头。

的确，拉斯蒂涅那时正像多少青年一样，陷入了僵局。特·纽沁根太太不知是真爱他呢还是特别喜欢调情，她拿出巴黎女子的外交手腕，教拉斯蒂涅尝遍了真正的爱情的痛苦。冒着大不韪当众把特·鲍赛昂太太的老表抓在身边之后，她反倒迟疑不决，不敢把他似乎已经享有的权利，实实在在地给他。一个月以来，欧也纳的欲火被她一再挑拨，连心都受到伤害了。初交的时候，大学生自以为居于主动的地位，后来特·纽沁根太太占了上风，故意装腔作势，勾起欧也纳所有善善恶恶的心思，那是代表一个巴黎青年的两三重人格的。她这一套是不是有计划的呢？不是的，女人即使在最虚假的时候也是真实的，因为她总受本能支配。但斐纳落在这青年人掌握之中，原是太快了一些；她所表示的感情也过分了些；也许她事后觉得有失尊严，想收回她的情分，或者暂时停止一下。而且，一个巴黎女人在爱情冲昏了头，快要下水之前，临时踌躇不决，试试那个她预备以身相许的人的心，也是应有之事。特·纽沁根太太既然上过一次当，一个自私的青年辜负她的一片忠心；她现在提防人家更是应该的。或许欧也纳因为得手太快而表示的大模大样的态度，使她看出有一点儿轻视的意味，那是他们微妙的关系促成的。她大概要在这样一个年纪轻轻的男人面前拿出一点威严，拿出一点大人气派；过去她在那个遗弃她的男人前面，做矮子做得太久了。正因为欧也纳知道她曾经落过特·玛赛之手，她不愿意他把自己当作容易征服的女人。并且在一个人妖、一个登徒子那儿尝过那种令人屈辱的乐趣以后，她觉得在爱情的乐园中闲逛一番另有一种说不出的甜蜜：欣赏一下所有的景致，饱听一番颤抖的声音，让清白的微风抚弄一会，她都认为是迷人的享受。纯正的爱情要替不纯正的爱情赎罪。这种不合理的情形永远不会减少，如果大家不了解初次的欺骗把一个少妇鲜花般的心摧残得多么厉害。不管但斐纳究竟是什么意思，总之她在玩弄拉斯蒂涅，而且引以为乐；因为她知道他爱她，知道只要她老人家高兴，可以随时消灭她情人的悲哀。欧也纳为了自尊心，不愿意初次上阵就吃败仗，便毫不放松地紧追着，仿佛猎人第一次过圣·于倍节[3]，非要打到一只火鸡不可。他的焦虑，受伤的自尊心，真真假假的绝望，使他越来越丢不掉那个女人。全巴黎都认为特·纽沁根太太是他的了，其实他和她并不比第一天见面时更接近。他还没有懂得，一个女人卖弄风情所给人的好处，有时反而远过于她的爱情所给人的快乐，所以他憋着一肚子无名火。虽说在女人对爱情欲迎故拒之际，拉斯蒂涅能尝到第一批果实，可是那些果子是青的，带酸的，咬在嘴里特别有味，所以代价也特别高。有时，眼看自己没有钱，没有前途，就顾不得良心的呼声而想到伏脱冷的计划，想和泰伊番小姐结婚，得她的家财。那天晚上他又是穷得一筹莫展，几乎不由自主地要接受可怕的斯芬克斯的计策了。他一向觉得那家伙的目光有勾魂摄魄的魔力。

波阿莱和米旭诺小姐上楼的时节，拉斯蒂涅以为除了伏盖太太和坐在壁炉旁边迷迷糊糊编织毛线套袖的古的太太以外，再没有旁人，便脉脉含情地瞅着泰伊番小姐，把她羞得低下头去。

“你难道也有伤心事吗，欧也纳先生？”维多莉沉默了一会说。

“哪个男人没有伤心事！”拉斯蒂涅回答，“我们这些时时刻刻预备为人牺牲的年轻人，要是能得到爱，得到赤诚的爱作为酬报，也许我们就不会伤心了。”

泰伊番小姐的回答只是毫不含糊地瞧了他一眼。

“小姐，你今天以为你的心的确如此这般；可是你敢保险永远不变吗？”

可怜的姑娘浮起一副笑容，好似灵魂中涌出一道光，把她的脸照得光艳动人。欧也纳想不到挑动了她这么强烈的感情，大吃一惊。

“嗳！要是你一朝有了钱，有了幸福，有一笔大家私从云端里掉在你头上，你还会爱一个你落难时候喜欢的穷小子吗？”

她姿势很美地点了点头。

“还会爱一个怪可怜的青年吗？”

又是点头。

“喂，你们胡扯些什么？”伏盖太太叫道。

“别打搅我们，”欧也纳回答，“我们谈得很投机呢。”

“敢情欧也纳·特·拉斯蒂涅骑士和维多莉·泰伊番小姐私订终身了吗？”伏脱冷低沉的嗓子突然在饭厅门口叫起来。

古的太太和伏盖太太同时说：“哟！你吓了我们一跳。”

“我挑的不算坏吧。”欧也纳笑着回答。伏脱冷的声音使他非常难受，他从来不曾有过那样可怕的感觉。

“嗳，你们两位别缺德啦！”古的太太说，“孩子，咱们该上楼了。”

伏盖太太跟着两个房客上楼，到她们屋里去消磨黄昏，节省她的灯烛柴火。饭厅内只剩下欧也纳和伏脱冷两人面面相对。

“我早知道你要到这一步的，”那家伙声色不动地说，“可是你听着！我是非常体贴人的。你心绪不大好，不用马上决定。你欠了债。我不愿意你为了冲动或是失望投到我这儿来，我要你用理智决定。也许你手头缺少几千法郎，嗯，你要吗？”

那魔鬼掏出皮夹，捡了三张钞票对大学生扬了一扬。欧也纳正窘得要命，欠着特·阿瞿达侯爵和特·脱拉伊伯爵两千法郎赌债。因为还不出钱，虽则大家在特·雷斯多太太府上等他，他不敢去。那是不拘形迹的集会，吃吃小点心，喝喝茶，可是在韦斯脱牌桌上可以输掉六千法郎。

“先生，”欧也纳好容易忍着身体的抽搐，说道，“自从你对我说了那番话，你该明白我不能再领你的情。”

“好啊，说得好，叫人听了怪舒服的，”那个一心想勾引他的人回答，“你是个漂亮小伙子，想得周到，像狮子一样高傲，像少女一样温柔。你这样的俘虏才配魔鬼的胃口呢。我就喜欢这种性格的年轻人。再加上几分政治家的策略，你就能看到社会的本相了。只要玩几套清高的小戏法，一个高明的人能够满足他所有的欲望，教台下的傻瓜连声喝彩。要不了几天，你就是我的人了。哦！你要愿意做我的徒弟，管教你万事如意，想什么就什么，并且马上到手，不论是名，是利，还是女人。凡是现代文明的精华，都可以拿来给你享受。我们要疼你，惯你，当你心肝宝贝，拼了命来让你寻欢作乐。有什么阻碍，我们替你一律铲平。倘使你再有顾虑，那你是把我当作坏蛋了？哼！你自以为清白，一个不比你少清白一点的人，特·丢兰纳先生，跟强盗们做着小生意，并不觉得有伤体面。你不愿意受我的好处，嗯？那容易，你先把这几张烂票子收下，”伏脱冷微微一笑，掏出一张贴好印花税的白纸，“你写：兹借到三千五百法郎，准一年内归楚。再填上日子！利息相当高，免得你多心。你可以叫我犹太人，用不着再欠我情了。今天你要瞧不起我也由你，以后你一定会喜欢我。你可以在我身上看到那些无底的深渊，广大无边的感情，傻子们管这些叫作罪恶；可是你永远不会觉得我没有种，或者无情无义。总之，我既不是小卒，也不是呆笨的士象，而是冲锋的车，告诉你！”

“你究竟是什么人？简直是生来跟我捣乱嚜！”欧也纳叫道。

“哪里！我是一个好人，不怕自己弄脏手，免得你一辈子陷在泥坑里。你问我这样热心为什么？嗳，有朝一日我会咬着你耳朵，轻轻告诉你的。我替你拆穿了社会上的把戏和诀窍，你就害怕；可是放心，这是你的怯场，跟新兵第一次上阵一样，马上会过去的。你慢慢自会把大众看作甘心情愿替自封为王的人当炮灰的大兵。可是时世变了。从前你对一个好汉说：给你三百法郎，替我去砍掉某人；他凭一句话把一个人送回了老家，若无其事地回家吃饭。如今我答应你偌大一笔家私，只要你点点头，又不连累你什么，你却是三心二意，委决不下。这年头真没出息。”

欧也纳立了借据，拿了钞票。

伏脱冷又说：“哎，来，来，咱们总得讲个理。几个月之内我要动身上美洲去种我的烟草了。我会捎雪茄给你。我有了钱，我会帮你忙。要是没有孩子（很可能，我不想在这个世界上留种），我把遗产传给你。够朋友吗？我可是喜欢你呀，我。我有那股痴情，要为一个人牺牲。我已经这样干过一回了。你看清楚没有，孩子？我生活的圈子比旁人的高一级。我认为行动只是手段，我眼里只看见目的。一个人是什么东西？——得！——”他把大拇指甲在牙齿上弹了一下，“一个人不是高于一切，就是分文不值。叫作波阿莱的时候，他连分文不值还谈不上，你可以像掐死一个臭虫一般掐死他，他干瘪，发臭。像你这样的人却是一个上帝，那可不是一架皮包的机器，而是有最美的情感在其中活动的舞台。我是单凭情感过活的。一宗情感，在你思想中不就等于整个世界吗？你瞧那高老头，两个女儿就是他整个的天地，就是他生活的指路标。我么，挖掘过人生之后，觉得世界上真正的情感只有男人之间的友谊。我醉心的是比哀和耶非哀。《威尼斯转危为安》[4]我全本背得出。一个伙计对你说：来，帮我埋一个尸首！你跟着就跑，鼻子都不哼一哼，也不唠唠叨叨对他谈什么仁义道德；这样有血性的人，你看到过几个？咱家我就干过这个。我并不对每个人都这么说。你是一个高明的人，可以对你无所不谈，你都能明白。这个满是癞蛤蟆的泥塘，你不会老待下去的。得了吧，一言为定。你一定会结婚的。咱们各自拿着枪杆冲吧！嘿，我的绝不是银样镴枪头，你放心！”

伏脱冷根本不想听欧也纳说出一个不字，径自走了，让他定定神。他似乎懂得这种忸怩作态的心理：人总喜欢小小地抗拒一下，对自己的良心有个交代，替以后的不正当行为找个开脱的理由。

“他怎么办都由他，我一定不娶泰伊番小姐！”欧也纳对自己说。

他想到可能和这个素来厌恶的人联盟，心中火辣辣的非常难受；但伏脱冷那些玩世不恭的思想，把社会踩在脚底下的胆量，使他越来越觉得那家伙了不起。他穿好衣服，雇了车上特·雷斯多太太家去了。几天以来，这位太太对他格外殷勤，因为他每走一步，和高等社会的核心接近一步，而且他似乎有朝一日会声势浩大。他付清了特·脱拉伊和特·阿瞿达两位的账，打了一场夜牌，输的钱都赢了回来。需要趱奔前程的人多半相信宿命；欧也纳就有这种迷信，认为他运气好是上天对他始终不离正路的报酬。第二天早上，他赶紧问伏脱冷借据有没有带在身边。一听到说是，他便不胜欣喜地把三千法郎还掉了。

“告诉你，事情很顺当呢。”伏脱冷对他说。

“我可不是你的同党。”

“我知道，我知道，”伏脱冷打断了他的话，“你还在闹孩子脾气，看戏只看场子外面的小丑。”

两天以后，波阿莱和米旭诺小姐，在植物园一条冷僻的走道中坐在太阳底下一张凳上，同医学生很有理由猜疑的一位先生说着话。

“小姐，”龚杜罗先生说，“我不懂你哪儿来的顾虑。警察部长大人阁下……”

“哦！警察部长大人阁下……”波阿莱跟着说了一遍。

“是的，部长大人亲自在处理这件案子。”龚杜罗又道。

这个自称为蒲风街上的财主说出警察二字，在安分良民的面具之下露出本相之后，退职的小公务员波阿莱，虽然毫无头脑，究竟是畏首畏尾不敢惹是招非的人，还会继续听下去，岂不是谁都觉得难以相信？其实是挺自然的。你要在愚夫愚妇中间了解波阿莱那个特殊的种族，只要听听某些观察家的意见，不过这意见至今尚未公布。世界上有一类专吃公事饭的民族，在衙门的预算表上列在第一至第三级之间的；第一级，年俸一千二，打个譬喻说，在衙门里仿佛冰天雪地中的格陵兰[5]；第三级，年俸三千至六千，气候比较温和，虽然种植不易，什么津贴等等也能存在了。这仰存鼻息的一批人自有许多懦弱下贱的特点，最显著的是对本衙门的大头儿有种不由自主的、机械的、本能的恐怖。小公务员之于大头儿，平时只认识一个看不清的签名式。在那般俯首帖耳的人看来，部长大人阁下几个字代表一种神圣的、没有申诉余地的威权。小公务员心目中的部长，好比基督徒心目中的教皇，做的事永远不会错的。部长的行为，言语，一切用他名义所说的话，都有部长的一道毫光；那个绣花式的签名把什么都遮盖了，把他命令人家做的事都变得合法了。大人这个称呼证明他用心纯正，意念圣洁；一切荒谬绝伦的主意，只消出之于大人之口便百无禁忌。那些可怜虫为了自己的利益所不肯做的事，一听到大人二字就赶紧奉命。衙门像军队一样，大家只知道闭着眼睛服从。这种制度不许你的良心抬头，灭绝你的人性，年深月久，把一个人变成政府机构中的一只螺丝。老于世故的龚杜罗到了要显原形的时候，马上像念咒一般说出大人二字唬一下波阿莱，因为他早已看出他是个吃过公事饭的脓包，并且觉得波阿莱是男性的米旭诺，正如米旭诺是女性的波阿莱。

“既然部长阁下，部长大人……那事情完全不同了。”波阿莱说。

那冒充的小财主回头对米旭诺说：“先生这话，你听见吗？你不是相信他的吗？部长大人已经完全确定，住在伏盖公寓的伏脱冷便是多隆苦役监的逃犯，绰号叫作鬼上当。”

“哦哟！鬼上当！”波阿莱道，“他有这个绰号，一定是运气很好喽。”

“对，”暗探说，“他这个绰号是因为犯了几桩非常大胆的案子都能死里逃生。你瞧，他不是一个危险分子吗？他有好些长处使他成了不起的人物。进了苦役监之后，他在帮口里更有面子了。”

“那么他是一个有面子的人了。”波阿莱道。

“嘿！他挣面子是另有一功的！他很喜欢一个小白脸，意大利人，爱赌钱，犯了伪造文书的罪，结果由他顶替了。那小伙子从此进了军队，变得很规矩。”

米旭诺小姐说：“既然部长大人已经确定伏脱冷便是鬼上当，还需要我干什么？”

“对啦，对啦！”波阿莱接着说，“要是部长，像你说的，切实知道……”

“谈不到切实，不过是疑心。让我慢慢说给你听吧。鬼上当的真姓名叫作约各·高冷，是三处苦役监囚犯的心腹、经理、银行老板。他在这些生意上赚到很多钱，干那种事当然要一表人才喽。”

波阿莱道：“哎，哎，小姐，你懂得这个双关语吗？先生叫他一表人才，因为他身上黥过印，有了标记。”

暗探接下去说：“假伏脱冷收了苦役犯的钱，代他们存放，保管，预备他们逃出以后使花；或者交给他们的家属，要是他们在遗嘱上写明的话；或者交给他们的情妇，将来托他出面领钱。”

波阿莱道：“怎么！他们的情妇？你是说他们的老婆吧？”

“不，先生，苦役监的犯人普通只有不合法的配偶，我们叫作姘妇。”

“那他们过的是姘居生活喽？”

“还用说吗？”

波阿莱道：“嗳，这种荒唐事儿，部长大人怎么不禁止呢？既然你荣幸得很，能见到部长，你又关切公众的福利，我觉得你应当把这些犯人的不道德行为提醒他。那种生活真是给社会一个很坏的榜样。”

“可是先生，政府送他们进苦役监并不是把他们作为道德的模范呀。”

“不错。可是先生，允许我……”

“嗳，好乖乖，你让这位先生说下去啊。”米旭诺小姐说。

“小姐，你知道，搜出一个违禁的钱库——听说数目很大——政府可以得到很大的利益。鬼上当经管大宗的财产，所收的赃不光是他的同伴的，还有万字帮的。”

“怎么！那些贼党竟有上万吗？”波阿莱骇然叫起来。

“不是这意思，万字帮是一个高等窃贼的团体，专作大案子的，不上一万法郎的买卖从来不干。帮口里的党员都是刑事犯中间最了不起的人物。他们熟读《法典》，从来不会在落网的时候被判死刑。高冷是他们的心腹，是他们的参谋。他神通广大，有他的警卫组织，爪牙密布，神秘莫测。我们派了许多暗探监视了他一年，还摸不清他的底细。他凭他的本领和财力，能够经常为非作歹，张罗犯罪的资本，让一批恶党不断地同社会斗争。抓到鬼上当，没收他的基金，等于把恶势力斩草除根。因此这桩侦探工作变了一件国家大事，凡是出力协助的人都有光荣。就是你先生，有了功也可以再进衙门办事，或者当个警察局的秘书，照样能拿你的养老金。”

“可是为什么，”米旭诺小姐问，“鬼上当不拿着他保管的钱逃走呢？”

暗探说：“噢！他无论到哪儿都有人跟着，万一他盗窃苦役犯的公款，就要被打死。况且卷逃一笔基金不像拐走一个良家妇女那么容易。再说，高冷是条好汉，决不干这样的勾当，他认为那是极不名誉的事。”

“你说得不错，先生，那他一定要声名扫地了。”波阿莱凑上两句。

米旭诺小姐说：“听了你这些话，我还是不懂干吗你们不直接上门抓他。”

“好吧，小姐，我来回答你……可是，”他咬着她耳朵说，“别让你的先生打断我，要不咱们永远讲不完。居然有人肯听这个家伙的话，大概他很有钱吧。——鬼上当到这儿来的时候，冒充安分良民，装作巴黎的小财主，住在一所极普通的公寓里；他狡猾得很，从来不会没有防备，因此伏脱冷先生是一个很体面的人物，做着了不起的买卖。”

“当然啰。”波阿莱私下想。

“部长不愿意弄错事情，抓了一个真伏脱冷，得罪巴黎的商界和舆论。要知道警察总监的地位也是不大稳的，他有他的敌人，一有错儿，钻谋他位置的人就会挑拨进步党人大叫大嚷，轰他下台。所以对付这件事要像对付高阿涅案子的圣·埃兰假伯爵一样；[6]要真有一个圣·埃兰伯爵的话，咱们不是糟了吗？因此咱们得证实他的身份。”

“对。可是你需要一个漂亮女人啊。”米旭诺小姐抢着说。

暗探说：“鬼上当从来不让一个女人近身；告诉你，他是不喜欢女人的。”

“这么说来，我还有什么作用，值得你给我两千法郎去替你证实？”

陌生人说：“简单得很。我给你一个小瓶，装着特意配好的酒精，能够教人像中风似的死过去，可没有生命危险。那个药可以掺在酒里或是咖啡里。等他一晕过去，你立刻把他放倒在床上，解开他衣服，装作看看他有没有断气。趁没有人的时候，你在他肩上打一下——啪——一声，印的字母马上会显出来。”

“那可一点儿不费事。”波阿莱说。

“嘹，那么你干不干呢？”龚杜罗问老姑娘。

“可是，亲爱的先生，要没有字显出来，我还能有两千法郎到手吗？”

“不。”

“那么怎样补偿我呢？”

“五百法郎。”

“为这么一点儿钱干这么一件事！良心上总是一块疙瘩，而我是要良心平安的，先生。”

波阿莱说：“我敢担保，小姐除了非常可爱非常聪明之外，还非常有良心。”

米旭诺小姐说：“还是这么办吧，他要真是鬼上当，你给我三千法郎；不是的话一个子儿都不要。”

“行，”龚杜罗回答，“可是有个条件，事情明儿就得办。”

“不能这么急，先生，我还得问问我的忏悔师。”

“你调皮，嗯！”暗探站起身来说，“那么明儿见。有什么要紧事儿找我，可以到圣·安纳小街，圣·夏班院子底上，穹隆底下只有一扇门，到那儿问龚杜罗先生就行了。”

皮安训上完居维哀的课回来，无意中听到鬼上当这个古怪字儿，也听见那有名的暗探所说的“行”。

“干吗不马上答应下来？三千法郎的终身年金，一年不是有三百法郎利息吗？”波阿莱问米旭诺。

“干吗！该想一想呀。倘使伏脱冷果真是鬼上当，跟他打交道也许好处更多。不过问他要钱等于给他通风报信，他会溜之大吉。那可两面落空，糟糕透啦！”

“你通知他也不行的，”波阿莱接口道，“那位先生不是说已经有人监视他吗？而你可什么都损失了。”

米旭诺小姐心里想：“并且我也不喜欢这家伙，他老对我说些不客气的话。”

波阿莱又说：“你还是那样办吧。我觉得那位先生挺好，衣服穿得整齐。他说得好，替社会去掉一个罪犯，不管他怎样义气，在我们总是服从法律。江山易改，本性难移。谁保得住他不会一时性起，把我们一齐杀掉？那才该死呢！他杀了人，我们是要负责任的，且不说咱们的命先要送在他手里。”

米旭诺小姐一肚子心事，没有工夫听波阿莱那些断断续续的话，好似没有关严的水龙头上漏出一滴一滴的水。这老头儿一朝说开了场，米旭诺小姐要不加阻拦，就会像开了发条的机器，嘀嘀咕咕永远没得完。他提出了一个主题，又岔开去讨论一些完全相反的主题，始终没有结论。回到伏盖公寓门口，他东拉西扯，旁征博引，正讲着在拉哥罗先生和莫冷太太的案子里他如何出庭替被告做证的故事。进得门来，米旭诺瞥见欧也纳跟泰伊番小姐谈得那么亲热那么有劲，连他们穿过饭厅都没有发觉。

“事情一定要到这一步的，”米旭诺对波阿莱说，“他们俩八天以来眉来眼去，恨不得把灵魂都扯下来。”

“是啊，”他回答，“所以她给定了罪。”

“谁？”

“莫冷太太喽。”

“我说维多莉小姐，你回答我莫冷太太。谁是莫冷太太？”米旭诺一边说一边不知不觉走进了波阿莱的屋子。

波阿莱问：“维多莉小姐有什么罪？”

“怎么没有罪？她不该爱上欧也纳先生，不知后果，没头没脑地瞎撞，可怜的傻孩子！”

欧也纳白天被特·纽沁根太太磨得绝望了。他内心已经完全向伏脱冷屈服，既不愿意推敲一下这个怪人对他的友谊是怎么回事，也不想想这种友谊的结果。一小时以来，他和泰伊番小姐信誓旦旦，亲热得了不得；他已经一脚踏进泥洼，只有奇迹才能把他拉出来。维多莉听了他的话以为听到了安琪儿的声音，天国的门开了，伏盖公寓染上了神奇的色彩，像舞台上的布景。她爱他，他也爱她，至少她是这样相信！在屋子里没有人窥探的时候，看到拉斯蒂涅这样的青年，听着他说话，哪个女人不会像她一样地相信呢？至于他，他和良心做着斗争，明知自己在做一桩坏事，而且是有心地做，心里想只要将来使维多莉快乐，他这点儿轻微的罪过就能补赎；绝望之下，他流露出一种悲壮的美，把心中所有地狱的光彩一齐放射出来。算他运气，奇迹出现了：伏脱冷兴冲冲地从外边进来，看透了他们的心思。这对青年原是由他恶魔般的天才撮合的，可是他们这时的快乐，突然被他粗声大气，带着取笑意味的歌声破坏了。





我的芳希德多可爱，

你瞧她多么朴实……[7]





维多莉一溜烟逃了。那时她心中的喜悦足够抵消她一生的痛苦。可怜的姑娘！握一握手，脸颊被欧也纳的头发厮磨一下，贴着她耳朵（连大学生嘴唇的暖气都感觉到）说的一句话，压在她腰里的一条颤巍巍的手臂，印在她脖子上的一个亲吻……在她都成为心心相印的记号；再加隔壁屋里的西尔维随时可能闯入这间春光烂漫的饭厅，那些热情的表现就比有名的爱情故事中的海誓山盟更热，更强烈，更动心。这些微不足道的小事，在一个每十五天忏悔一次的姑娘，已经是天大的罪过了。即使她将来有了钱，有了快乐，整个委身于人的时节，流露的真情也不能同这个时候相比。

“事情定局了，”伏脱冷对欧也纳道，“两位哥儿已经打过架。一切都进行得很得体。是为了政见不同。咱们的鸽子侮辱了我的老鹰，明天在葛里娘谷堡垒交手。八点半，正当泰伊番小姐在这儿消消停停拿面包浸在咖啡里的时候，就好承继她父亲的慈爱和财产。你想不奇怪吗！泰伊番那小子的剑法很高明，他狠天狠地，像抓了一手大牌似的，可是休想逃过我的撒手锏。你知道，我有一套挑起剑来直刺脑门的家数，将来我教给你，有用得很呢。”

拉斯蒂涅听着愣住了，一句话都说不上来。这时高老头、皮安训和别的几个包饭客人进来了。

“你这样我才称心呢，”伏脱冷对他道，“你做的事，你心中有数。行啦，我的小老鹰！你将来一定能支配人；你又强，又痛快，又勇敢；我佩服你。”

伏脱冷想握他的手，拉斯蒂涅急忙缩回去；他脸色发白，倒在椅子里，似乎看到眼前淌着一堆血。

“啊！咱们的良心还在那儿嘀咕，”伏脱冷低声说，“老头儿有三百万，我知道他的家私。这样一笔陪嫁尽可把你洗刷干净，跟新娘的礼服一样白；那时你自己也会觉得问心无愧呢。”

拉斯蒂涅不再迟疑，决定当夜去通知泰伊番父子。伏脱冷走开了，高老头凑在他耳边说：

“你很不高兴，孩子。我来给你开开心吧，你来！”说完老人在灯上点了火把，欧也纳存着好奇心跟他上楼。

高老头问西尔维要了大学生的钥匙，说道：“到你屋子里去。今天早上你以为她不爱你了，嗯？她硬要你走了，你生气了，绝望了。傻子！她等我去呢。明白没有？我们约好要去收拾一所小巧玲珑的屋子，让你三天之内搬去住。你不能出卖我哪。她要瞒着你，到时教你喜出望外，我可是忍不住了。你的屋子在阿多阿街，离圣·拉查街只有两步路。那儿包你像王爷一般舒服。我们替你办的家具像新娘用的。一个月工夫，我们瞒着你做了好多事。我的诉讼代理人已经在交涉，将来我女儿一年有三万六千收入，是她陪嫁的利息，我要女婿把她的八十万法郎投资在房地产上面。”

欧也纳不声不响，抱着手臂在他乱七八糟的小房间里踱来踱去。高老头趁大学生转身的当儿，把一个红皮匣子放在壁炉架上，匣子外面有特·拉斯蒂涅家的烫金的纹章。

“亲爱的孩子，”可怜的老头儿说，“我全副精神对付这些事。可是，你知道，我也自私得很，你的搬家对我也有好处。嗯，你不会拒绝我吧，倘使我有点儿要求？”

“什么事？”

“你屋子的六层楼上有一间卧房，也是归你的，我想住在那里，行吗？我老了，离开女儿太远了。我不会打搅你的，光是住在那儿。你每天晚上跟我谈谈她。你说，你不会讨厌吧？你回家的时候，我睡在床上听到你的声音，心里想：——他才见过我的小但斐纳，带她去跳舞，使她快乐。——要是我病了，听你回来，走动，出门，等于给我心上涂了止痛膏。你身上有我女儿的气息！我只要走几步路就到天野大道，她天天在那儿过，我可以天天看到她，不会再像从前那样迟到了。也许她还会上你这儿来！我可以听到她，看她穿着梳妆衣，踅着细步，像小猫一样可爱地走来走去。一个月到现在，她又恢复了从前小姑娘的模样，快活，漂亮，她的心情复原了，你给了她幸福。哦！什么办不到的事，我都替你办。她刚才回家的路上对我说：‘爸爸，我真快活！’——听她们一本正经地叫我父亲，我的心就冰冷；一叫我爸爸，我又看到了她们小时候的样子，回想起从前的事。我觉得自己还是十足十的父亲，她们还没有给旁人占去！”

老头儿抹了抹眼泪。

“好久我没听见她们叫我爸爸了，好久没有搀过她们的胳膊了。唉！是呀，十年工夫我没有同女儿肩并肩地一块儿走了。挨着她的裙子，跟着她的脚步，沾到她的暖气，多舒服啊！今儿早上我居然能带了但斐纳到处跑，同她一块儿上铺子买东西，又送她回家。噢！你一定得收留我！你要人帮忙的时候，有我在那儿，就好伺候你啦。倘若那个亚尔萨斯臭胖子死了，倘若他的痛风症乖乖地跑进了他的胃，我女儿不知该多么高兴呢！那时你可以做我的女婿，堂而皇之做她的丈夫了。唉！她那么可怜，一点儿人生的乐趣都没有尝到，所以我什么都原谅她。好天爷总该保佑慈爱的父亲吧。”他停了一会，侧了侧脑袋又说，“她太爱你了，上街的时候她跟我提到你：‘是不是，爸爸，他好极了！他多有良心！有没有提到我呢！’——呃，从阿多阿街到巴诺拉玛巷，拉拉扯扯不知说了多少！总之，她把她的心都倒在我的心里了。整整一个上午我快乐极了，不觉得老了，我的身体还不到一两重。我告诉她，你把一千法郎交给了我。哦！我的小心肝听着哭了。”

拉斯蒂涅站在那儿不动，高老头忍不住了，说道：

“嗳，你壁炉架上放的什么呀？”

欧也纳愣头愣脑地望着他的邻居。伏脱冷告诉他明天要决斗了；高老头告诉他，渴望已久的梦想要实现了。两个那么极端的消息，使他好像做了一场噩梦。他转身瞧了瞧壁炉架，看到那小方匣子，马上打开，发现一张纸条下面放着一只勃勒甘牌子的表。纸上写着：





“我要你时时刻刻想到我，因为……但斐纳”



最后一句大概暗指他们俩某一次的争执，欧也纳看了大为感动。拉斯蒂涅的纹章是在匣子里边用釉彩堆成的。这件想望已久的装饰品，链条，钥匙，式样，图案，他件件中意。高老头在旁乐得眉飞色舞。他准是答应女儿把欧也纳惊喜交集的情形告诉她听的；这些年轻人的激动也有老人的份，他的快乐也不下于他们两人。他已经非常喜欢拉斯蒂涅了，为了女儿，也为了拉斯蒂涅本人。

“你今晚一定要去看她，她等着你呢。亚尔萨斯臭胖子在他舞女那儿吃饭。嗳，嗳，我的代理人向他指出事实，他愣住了。他不是说爱我女儿爱得五体投地么？哼，要是他碰一碰她，我就要他的命。一想到我的但斐纳……（他叹了口气）我简直气得要犯法；呸，杀了他不能说杀了人，不过是牛头马面的一个畜生罢了。你会留我一块儿住的，是不是？”

“是的，老丈，你知道我是喜欢你的……”

“我早看出了，你并没觉得我丢你的脸。来，让我拥抱你。”他搂着大学生，“答应我，你得使她快乐！今晚你一定去了？”

“噢，是的。我先上街去一趟，有件要紧事儿，不能耽误。”

“我能不能帮忙呢？”

“哦，对啦！我上纽沁根太太家，你去见泰伊番老头，要他今天晚上给我约个时间，我有件紧急的事和他谈。”

高老头脸色变了，说道：“楼下那些浑蛋说你追求他的女儿，可是真的，小伙子？该死！你可不知什么叫作高里奥的老拳呢。你要欺骗我们，就得教你尝尝味儿了。哦！那是不可能的。”

大学生道：“我可以赌咒，世界上我只爱一个女人，连我自己也只是刚才知道。”

高老头道：“啊，那才好呢！”

“可是，”大学生又说，“泰伊番的儿子明天要同人决斗，听说他会送命的。”

高老头道：“那跟你有什么相干？”

欧也纳道：“噢！非告诉他不可，别让他的儿子去……”

伏脱冷在房门口唱起歌来，打断了欧也纳的话：





㕭，理查，㕭，我的陛下，

世界把你丢啊……[8]





勃龙！勃龙！勃龙！勃龙！勃龙！





我久已走遍了世界，

人家到处看见我呀……





脱啦，啦，啦，啦……

“诸位先生，”克利斯朵夫叫道，“汤冷了，饭厅上人都到齐了。”

“喂，”伏脱冷喊，“来拿我的一瓶波尔多去。”[9]

“你觉得好看吗，那只表？”高老头问，“她挑的不差可不是？”

伏脱冷、高老头和拉斯蒂涅三个人一同下楼，因为迟到，在饭桌上坐在一处。吃饭的时候，欧也纳一直对伏脱冷很冷淡；可是伏盖太太觉得那个挺可爱的家伙从来没有这样的谈锋。他诙谑百出，把桌上的人都引得非常高兴。这种安详，这种镇静，欧也纳看着害怕了。

“你今儿交了什么运呀，快活得像云雀一样？”伏盖太太问。

“我做了好买卖总是快活的。”

“买卖？”欧也纳问。

“是啊。我交出了一部分货，将来好拿一笔佣金。”他发觉老姑娘在打量他，便问：“米旭诺小姐，你这样盯着我，是不是我脸上有什么地方教你不舒服？老实告诉我，为了讨你欢喜，我可以改变的。”

他又瞅着老公务员说：“波阿莱，咱们不会因此生气的，是不是？”

“真是！你倒好替雕刻家做模特儿，让他塑一个滑稽大家的像呢。”青年画家对伏脱冷道。

“不反对！只要米旭诺小姐肯给人雕做拉希公墓[10]的爱神，”伏脱冷回答。

“那么波阿莱呢？”皮安训问。

“噢！波阿莱就扮作波阿莱。他是果园里的神道，是梨的化身。”[11]伏脱冷回答。

“那你是坐在梨跟酪饼之间了。”皮安训说。

“都是废话，”伏盖太太插嘴道，“还是把你那瓶波尔多献出来吧，又好健胃又好助兴。那个瓶已经在那儿伸头探颈了！”

“诸位，”伏脱冷道，“主席叫我们遵守秩序。古的太太和维多莉小姐虽不会对你们的胡说八道生气，可不能侵犯无辜的高老头。我请大家喝一瓶波尔多，那是靠着拉斐德先生的大名而格外出名的。我这么说可毫无政治意味。[12]——来呀，你这傻子！”他望着一动不动的克利斯朵夫叫，“这儿来，克利斯朵夫！怎么你没听见你名字？傻瓜！把酒端上来！”

“来啦，先生。”克利斯朵夫捧着酒瓶给他。

伏脱冷给欧也纳和高老头个个斟了一杯，自己也倒了几滴。两个邻居已经在喝了，伏脱冷拿起杯子辨了辨味道，忽然扮了个鬼脸：

“见鬼！见鬼！有瓶塞子味儿。克利斯朵夫，这瓶给你吧，另外去拿，在右边，你知道？咱们一共十六个，拿八瓶下来。”

“既然你破钞，”画家说，“我也来买一百个栗子。”

“哦！哦！”

“啵！啵！”

“哎！哎！”

每个人大惊小怪地叫嚷，好似花简里放出来的火箭。

“喂，伏盖妈妈，来两瓶香槟。”伏脱冷叫。

“亏你想得出，干吗不把整个屋子吃光了？两瓶香槟！十二法郎！我哪儿去挣十二法郎！不成，不成。要是欧也纳先生肯付香槟的账，我请大家喝果子酒。”

“吓！他的果子酒像秦皮汁一样难闻。”医学生低声说。

拉斯蒂涅道：“别说了，皮安训，我听见秦皮汁三个字就恶心……行！去拿香槟，我付账就是了。”

“西尔维，”伏盖太太叫，“拿饼干跟小点心来。”

伏脱冷道：“你的小点心太大了，而且出毛了。还是拿饼干来吧。”

一霎时，波尔多斟遍了，饭桌上大家提足精神，越来越开心。粗野疯狂的笑声夹着各种野兽的叫声。博物院管事学巴黎街上的一种叫卖声，活像猫儿叫春。立刻八个声音同时嚷起来：

“磨刀哇！磨刀哇！”

“鸟粟子呕！”

“卷饼，太太们，卷饼㗒！”

“修锅子，补锅子！”

“船上来的鲜鱼呕！鲜鱼呕！”

“要不要打老婆，要不要拍衣服？”

“有旧衣服、旧金线、旧帽子卖？”

“甜樱桃啊甜樱桃！”

最妙的是皮安训用鼻音哼的“修阳伞哇”！

几分钟之内，哗哩哗啦，沸沸扬扬，把人脑袋都胀破了。你一句我一句，无非是瞎说八道，像一出大杂耍。伏脱冷一边当指挥一边冷眼觑着欧也纳和高里奥。两人好像已经醉了，靠着椅子，一本正经望着这片从来未有的混乱，很少喝酒，都想着晚上要做的事，可是都觉得身子抬不起来。伏脱冷在眼梢里留意他们的神色，等到他们眼睛迷迷糊糊快要闭上了，他贴着拉斯蒂涅的耳朵说：

“喂，小家伙，你还耍不过伏脱冷老头呢。他太喜欢你了，不能让你胡闹。一朝我决心要干什么事，只有上帝能拦住我。嘿！咱们想给泰伊番老头通风报信，跟小学生一样糊涂！炉子烧热了，面粉捏好了，面包放上铲子了；明儿咱们就可以咬在嘴里，丢着面包心子玩儿了，你竟想捣乱吗？不成不成，生米一定得煮成熟饭！心中要有什么小小的不舒服，等你吃的东西消化了，那点儿不舒服也就没有啦。咱们睡觉的时候，上校弗朗却西尼伯爵剑头一挥，替你把米希尔·泰伊番的遗产张罗好啦。维多莉继承了她的哥哥，一年有小小的一万五千收入。我已经打听清楚，光是母亲的遗产就有三十万以上……”

欧也纳听着这些话不能回答，只觉得舌尖跟上颚粘在一块，身子重甸甸的，瞌睡得要死。他只能隔了一重明晃晃的雾，看见桌子和同桌的人的脸。不久，声音静下来，客人一个一个地散了，临了只剩下伏盖太太、古的太太、维多莉、伏脱冷和高老头。拉斯蒂涅好似在梦中，瞥见伏盖太太忙着倒瓶里的余酒，把别的瓶子装满。

寡妇说：“嗳！他们疯疯癫癫，多年轻啊！”

这是欧也纳听到的最后一句话。

西尔维道：“只有伏脱冷先生才会教人这样快活，哟！克利斯朵夫打鼾打得像陀螺一样。”

“再见，伏盖妈妈，我要到大街上看玛蒂演《荒山》去了，那是把《孤独者》改编的戏。倘使你愿意，我请你和这些太太们一块儿去。”

古的太太回答：“我们不去，谢谢你。”

伏盖太太说：“怎么，我的邻居！你不想看《孤独者》改编的戏？那是阿达拉·特·夏多勃里昂[13]写的小说，我们看得津津有味，去年夏天在菩提树下哭得像玛特兰纳，而且是一部伦理作品，正好教育教育你的小姐呢。”

维多莉回答：“照教会的规矩，我们不能看喜剧。”

“哦，这两个都人事不知了。”伏脱冷把高老头和欧也纳的脑袋滑稽地摇了一下。

他扶着大学生的头靠在椅背上，让他睡得舒服些，一边热烈地亲了亲他的额角，唱道：





睡吧，我的心肝肉儿！

我永远替你们守护。[14]





维多莉道：“我怕他害病呢。”

伏脱冷道：“那你在这里照应他吧。”又凑着她的耳朵说，“那是你做贤妻的责任。他真爱你啊，这小伙子。我看，你将来会做他的小媳妇儿。”他又提高了嗓子：“末了，他们在地方上受人尊敬，白头偕老，子孙满堂。所有的爱情故事都这样结束的。哎，妈妈，”他转身搂着伏盖太太，“去戴上帽子，穿上漂亮的小花绸袍子，披上当年伯爵夫人的披肩。让我去替你雇辆车。”说完他唱着歌出去了：





太阳，太阳，神明的太阳，

是你晒熟了南瓜的瓜瓤……[15]





伏盖太太说：“天哪！你瞧，古的太太，这样的男人才教我日子过得舒服呢。”她又转身对着面条商说：“哟，高老头去啦。这啬刻鬼从来没想到带我上哪儿去过。我的天，他要倒下来啦。上了年纪的人再失掉理性，太不像话！也许你们要说，没有理性的人根本丢不了什么。西尔维，扶他上楼吧。”

西尔维抓着老人的胳膊扶他上楼，当他铺盖卷似的横在床上。

“可怜的小伙子，”古的太太说着，把欧也纳挡着眼睛的头发撩上去，“真像个女孩子，还不知道喝醉是怎么回事呢。”

伏盖太太道：“啊！我开了三十一年公寓，像俗话说的，手里经过的年轻人也不少了；像欧也纳先生这么可爱、这么出众的人才，可从来没见过。瞧他睡得多美！把他的头放在你肩上吧，古的太太。呃，他倒在维多莉小姐肩上了。孩子们是有神道保佑的。再侧过一点，他就碰在椅背的葫芦上啦。他们俩配起来倒是挺好的一对。”

古的太太道：“好太太，别胡说，你的话……”

伏盖太太回答：“呃！他听不见的。来，西尔维，帮我去穿衣服，我要戴上我的大胸褡。”

西尔维道：“哎哟！太太，吃饱了饭戴大胸褡！不，你找别人吧，我下不了这毒手。你这么不小心是有性命危险的。”

“管他，总得替伏脱冷先生挣个面子。”

“那你对承继人真是太好了。”

寡妇一边走一边吆喝：“嗳，西尔维，别顶嘴啦。”

厨娘对维多莉指着女主人，说：“在她那个年纪！”

饭厅里只剩下古的太太和维多莉，欧也纳靠在维多莉肩膀上睡着。静悄悄的屋里只听见克利斯朵夫的打鼾声，相形之下，欧也纳的睡眠越加显得恬静，像儿童一般妩媚。维多莉脸上有种母性一般的表情，好像很得意；因为她有机会照顾欧也纳，借此发泄女人的情感，同时又能听到男人的心在自己的心旁跳动，而没有一点犯罪的感觉。千思百念在胸中涌起，跟一股年轻纯洁的热流接触之下，她情绪激动，说不出有多么快活。

古的太太紧紧握着她的手说：“可怜的好孩子！”

天真而苦恼的脸上罩着幸福的光轮，老太太看了暗暗称赏。维多莉很像中世纪古拙的画像，没有琐碎的枝节，沉着有力的笔触只着重面部，黄黄的皮色仿佛反映着天国的金光。

维多莉摩着欧也纳的头发说：“他只不过喝了两杯呀，妈妈。”

“孩子，他要是胡闹惯的，酒量就会跟别人一样了。他喝醉倒是证明他老实。”

街上传来一辆车子的声音。

年轻的姑娘说：“妈妈，伏脱冷先生来了。你来扶一扶欧也纳先生。我不愿意给那个人看见。他说话叫人精神上感到污辱，瞧起人来真受不了，仿佛剥掉人的衣衫一样。”

古的太太说：“不，你看错了！他是个好人，有点像过去的古的先生，虽然粗鲁，本性可是不坏，他是好人歹脾气。”

在柔和的灯光抚弄之下，两个孩子正好配成一幅图画。伏脱冷悄悄地走进来，抱了手臂，望着他们说道：

“哎哟！多有意思的一幕，喔！给《保尔和维吉妮》的作者，贝那丹·特·圣比埃尔看到了，一定会写出好文章来。青春真美，不是吗，古的太太？”他又端详了一会欧也纳，说道：“好孩子，睡吧。有时福气就在睡觉的时候来的。”他又回头对寡妇道：“太太，我疼这个孩子，不但因为他生得清秀，还因为他心好。你瞧他不是一个薛侣班靠在天使肩上么？真可爱！我要是女人，我愿意为了他而死，（哦，不！不这么傻！）愿意为了他而活！这样欣赏他们的时候，太太，”他贴在寡妇耳边悄悄地说，“不由不想到他们是天生一对，地造一双。”然后他又提高了嗓子：“上帝给我们安排的路是神秘莫测的，他鉴察人心，试验人的肺腑。[16]孩子们，看到你们俩都一样的纯洁，一样的有情有义，我相信一朝结合了，你们决不会分离。上帝是正直的。”他又对维多莉说：“我觉得你很有福相，给我瞧瞧你的手，小姐。我会看手相，人家的好运气常常被我说准的。哎唷！你的手怎么啦？真的，你马上要发财了，爱你的人也要托你的福了。父亲会叫你回家，你将来要嫁给一个年轻的人，又漂亮又有头衔，又爱你！”

妖娆的伏盖寡妇下楼了，沉重的脚声打断了伏脱冷的预言。

“瞧啊，伏盖妈妈美丽得像一颗明明明……明星，包扎得像根红萝卜。不有点儿气急吗？”他把手按着她胸口说，“啊，胸脯绑得很紧了，妈妈。不哭则已，一哭准会爆炸；可是放心，我会像古董商一样把你仔仔细细捡起来的。”

寡妇咬着古的太太的耳朵说：“他真会讲法国式的奉承话，这家伙！”

“再见，孩子们，”伏脱冷转身招呼欧也纳和维多莉，一只手放在他们头上，“我祝福你们！相信我，小姐，一个规矩老实的人的祝福是有道理的，包你吉利，上帝会听他的话的。”

“再见，好朋友。”伏盖太太对她的女房客说，又轻轻补上一句：“你想伏脱冷先生对我有意思吗？”

“呕！呕！”

他们走后，维多莉瞧着自己的手叹道：

“唉！亲爱的妈妈，倘若真应了伏脱冷先生的话！”

老太太回答：“那也不难，只消你那魔鬼哥哥从马上倒栽下来就成了。”

“噢！妈妈！”

寡妇道：“我的天！咒敌人也许是桩罪过，好，那么我来补赎吧。真的，我很愿意给他送点儿花到坟上去。他那个坏良心，没有勇气替母亲说话，只晓得拿她的遗产，夺你的家私。当时你妈妈陪嫁很多，算你倒霉，婚书上没有提。”

维多莉说：“要拿人家的性命来换我的幸福，我心上永远不会安乐的。倘使要我幸福就得去掉我哥哥，那我宁可永久住在这儿。”

“伏脱冷先生说得好，谁知道全能的上帝高兴教我们走哪条路呢？——你瞧他是信教的，不像旁人提到上帝比魔鬼还要不敬。”

她们靠着西尔维帮忙，把欧也纳抬进卧房，放倒在床上；厨娘替他脱了衣服，让他舒舒服服地睡觉。临走，维多莉趁老太太一转身，在欧也纳额上亲了一亲，觉得这种偷偷摸摸的罪过真有说不出的快乐。她瞧瞧他的卧室，仿佛把这一天上多多少少的幸福归纳起来，在脑海中构成一幅图画，让自己老半天地看着出神。她睡熟的时候变了巴黎最快乐的姑娘。

伏脱冷在酒里下了麻醉药，借款待众人的机会灌醉了欧也纳和高老头，这一下他可断送了自己。半醉的皮安训忘了向米旭诺追问鬼上当那个名字。要是他说了，伏脱冷，或者约各·高冷——在此我们不妨对苦役监中的大人物还他的真名实姓——一定会马上提防。后来，米旭诺小姐认为高冷性情豪爽，正在盘算给他通风报信，让他在半夜里逃走，是不是更好的时候，听到拉希公墓上的爱神那个绰号，便突然改变主意。她吃过饭由波阿莱陪着出门，到圣·安纳街找那有名的特务头子去了，心里还以为他不过是个名叫龚杜罗的高级职员。特务长见了她挺客气。把一切细节说妥之后，米旭诺小姐要求那个检验黥印的药品。看到圣·安纳街的大人物在书桌抽斗内找寻药品时那种得意的态度，米旭诺才懂得这件事情的重要性还不止在于掩捕一个普通的逃犯。她仔细一想，觉得警察当局还希望根据苦役监内线的告密，赶得上没收那笔巨大的基金。她把这点疑心向那老狐狸说了，他却笑了笑，有心破除老姑娘的疑心。

“你想错了，”他说，“在贼党里，高冷是一个从来未有的最危险的博士，我们要抓他是为这一点。那些坏蛋也都知道；他是他们的军旗，他们的后台，他们的拿破仑；他们都爱戴他。这家伙永远不会把他的老根丢在葛兰佛广场上的。”[17]

米旭诺听了莫名其妙，龚杜罗给她解释，他用的两句土话是贼党里极有分量的切口，他们早就懂得一个人的脑袋可有两种看法：博士是一个活人的头脑，是他的参谋，是他的思想；老根是个轻蔑的字眼，表示头颅落地之后毫无用处。

他接着说：“高冷拿我们打哈哈。对付那些英国钢条般的家伙，我们也有一个办法，只要他们在逮捕的时候稍微抵抗一下，立刻把他干掉。我们希望高冷明天动武，好把他当场格杀。这么一来，诉讼啊，看守的费用啊，监狱里的伙食啊，一概可以省掉，同时又替社会除了害。起诉的手续，证人的传唤，旅费津贴，执行判决，凡是对付这些无赖的合法步骤所花的钱，远不止你到手的三千法郎。并且还有节省时间的问题。一刀戳进鬼上当的肚子，可以消弭上百件的罪案，教多少无赖不敢越过轻罪法庭的范围。这就叫作警政办得好。照真正慈善家的理论，这种办法便是预防犯罪。”

“这就是替国家出力呀。”波阿莱道。

“对啦，你今晚的话才说得有理了。是呀，我们当然是替国家出力啰。外边的人对我们很不公平，其实我们暗中帮了社会多少的忙。再说，一个人不受偏见约束才算高明，违反成见所做的好事自然免不了害处，能忍受这种害处才是基督徒。你瞧，巴黎终究是巴黎。这句话就说明了我的生活。小姐，再见吧。明天我带着人在植物园等。你叫克利斯朵夫上蒲风街我前次住的地方找龚杜罗先生就得了。先生，将来你丢了东西，尽管来找我，包你物归原主。我随时可以帮忙。”

“嗳，”波阿莱走到外边对米旭诺小姐说，“世界上竟有些傻子，一听见警察两字就吓得魂不附体。可是这位先生多和气，他要你做的事情又像打招呼一样简单。”

第二天是伏盖公寓历史上最重大的日子。至此为止，平静的公寓生活中最显著的事件，是那个假伯爵夫人像彗星一般地出现。可是同这一日天翻地覆的事（从此成为伏盖太太永久的话题）一比，一切都黯淡无光了。先是高里奥和欧也纳一觉睡到十一点。伏盖太太半夜才从快乐戏院回家，早上十点半还在床上。喝了伏脱冷给的剩酒，克利斯朵夫的酣睡耽误了屋里的杂务。波阿莱和米旭诺小姐并不抱怨早饭开得晚。维多莉和古的太太也睡了晚觉。伏脱冷八点以前就出门，直到开饭才回来。十一点一刻，西尔维和克利斯朵夫去敲各人的房门请吃早饭，居然没有一个人说什么不满意的话。两个仆人一走开，米旭诺小姐首先下楼，把药水倒入伏脱冷自备的银杯，那是装满了他冲咖啡用的牛奶，跟旁人的一起炖在锅子上的。老姑娘算好利用公寓里这个习惯下手。七个房客过了好一会才到齐。欧也纳伸着懒腰最后一个下楼，正碰上特·纽沁根太太的信差送来一封信，写的是：


“朋友，我对你并不生气，也不觉得我有损尊严。我等到半夜二点，等一个心爱的人！受过这种罪的人决不会教人家受。我看出你是第一次恋爱。你碰到了什么事呢？我真急死了。要不怕泄露心中的秘密，我就亲自来了，看看你遇到的究竟是凶是吉。可是在那个时候出门，不论步行或是坐车，岂不是断送自己？我这才觉得做女人的苦。我放心不下，请你告诉我为什么父亲对你说了那些话之后，你竟没有来。我要生你的气，可是会原谅你的。你病了么？为什么住得这样远？求你开声口吧。希望马上就来。倘若有事，只消回我一个字：或者说就来，或者说害病。不过你要不舒服的话，父亲会来通知我的。那么究竟是怎么回事呢？……”



“是啊，怎么回事呢？”欧也纳叫了起来。他搓着没有念完的信，冲进饭厅，问：“几点了？”

“十一点半。”伏脱冷一边说一边把糖放进咖啡。

那逃犯冷静而迷人的眼睛瞪着欧也纳。凡是天生能勾魂摄魄的人都有这种目光，据说能镇压疯人院中的武痴。欧也纳不禁浑身哆嗦。街上传来一辆马车的声音，泰伊番先生家一个穿号衣的当差神色慌张地冲进来，古的太太一眼便认出了。

“小姐，”他叫道，“老爷请您回去，家里出了事。弗莱特烈先生跟人决斗，脑门上中了一剑，医生认为没有希望了，恐怕您来不及跟他见面了，已经昏迷了。”

伏脱冷叫道：“可怜的小伙子！有了三万一年的收入，怎么还能打架？年轻人真不懂事。”

“吓，老兄！”欧也纳对他嚷道。

“怎么，你这个大孩子？巴黎哪一天没有人决斗？”伏脱冷一边回答一边若无其事地喝完咖啡。米旭诺小姐全副精神看他这个动作，听到那件惊动大众的新闻也不觉得震动。

古的太太说：“我跟你一块儿去，维多莉。”

她们俩帽子也没戴，披肩也没拿，径自跑了。维多莉临走噙着泪对欧也纳望了一眼，仿佛说：“想不到我们的幸福要教我流泪！”

伏盖太太道：“呃，你竟是未卜先知了，伏脱冷先生？”

约各·高冷回答：“我是先知，我是一切。”

伏盖太太对这件事又说了一大堆废话：“不是奇怪吗！死神来寻到我们，连商量都不跟我们商量一下。年轻人往往走在老年人之前。我们女人总算运气，用不着决斗；可是也有男人没有的病痛。我们要生孩子，而做母亲的苦难是很长的！维多莉真福气！这会儿她父亲没有办法啦，只能让她承继啰。”

“可不是！”伏脱冷望着欧也纳说，“昨天两手空空，今儿就有了几百万！”

伏盖太太叫道：“喂，欧也纳先生，这一下你倒是中了头彩啦。”

听到这一句，高老头瞧了瞧欧也纳，发现他手中还拿着一封团皱的信。

“你还没有把信念完呢！……这是什么意思？难道你也跟旁人一样吗？”他问欧也纳。

“太太，我永远不会娶维多莉小姐。”欧也纳回答伏盖太太的时候，不胜厌恶的口气教在场的人都觉得奇怪。

高老头抓起大学生的手握着，恨不得亲它一下。

伏脱冷道：“哦，哦！意大利人有句妙语，叫作听时间安排！”

“我等回音呢。”纽沁根太太的信差催问拉斯蒂涅。

“告诉太太说我会去的。”

信差走了。欧也纳心烦意躁，紧张到极点，再也顾不得谨慎不谨慎了。他高声自言自语：“怎么办？一点儿没有证据！”

伏脱冷微微笑着。他吞下的药品已经发作，只是逃犯的身体非常结实，还能站起来瞧着拉斯蒂涅，沉着嗓子说：

“孩子，福气就在睡觉的时候来的。”

说完他直僵僵地倒在地下。

欧也纳道：“果真是神灵不爽！”

“哎哟！他怎么啦？这个可怜的亲爱的伏脱冷先生？”

米旭诺小姐叫道：“那是中风啊。”

“喂，西尔维，请医生去。”寡妇吩咐。“拉斯蒂涅先生，你快去找皮安训先生。说不定西尔维碰不到我们的葛兰泼莱医生。”

拉斯蒂涅很高兴借此机会逃出这个可怕的魔窟，便连奔带跑地溜了。

“克利斯朵夫，你上药铺去要些治中风的药。”

克利斯朵夫出去了。

“哎，喂，高老头，帮我们抬他上楼，抬到他屋里去。”

大家抓着伏脱冷，七手八脚抬上楼梯，放在床上。

高里奥说：“我帮不了什么忙，我要看女儿去了。”

“自私的老头儿！”伏盖太太叫道，“去吧，但愿你不得好死，孤零零地像野狗一样！”

“瞧瞧你屋子里可有乙醚。”米旭诺小姐一边对伏盖太太说，一边和波阿莱解开伏脱冷的衣服。

伏盖太太下楼到自己卧房去，米旭诺小姐就可以为所欲为了。

她吩咐波阿莱：“赶快，脱掉他的衬衫，把他翻过来！你至少也该有点儿用处，总不成叫我看到他赤身露体。你老待在那里干吗？”

伏脱冷给翻过身来，米旭诺照准他肩头一巴掌打过去，鲜红的皮肤上立刻白白地泛出两个该死的字母。

“吓！一眨眼你就得了三千法郎赏格。”波阿莱说着，扶住伏脱冷，让米旭诺替他穿上衬衣。——他把伏脱冷放倒在床上，又道：“呃，好重啊！”

“别多嘴！瞧瞧有什么银箱没有？”老姑娘性急慌忙地说，一双眼睛拼命打量屋里的家具，恨不得透过墙壁才好。

她又道：“最好想个理由打开这口书柜！”

波阿莱回答：“恐怕不大好吧？”

“为什么不大好？贼赃是公的，不能说是谁的了。可惜来不及，已经听到伏盖的声音了。”

伏盖太太说：“乙醚来了。哎，今天的怪事真多。我的天！这个人是不会害病的，他白得像仔鸡一样。”

“像仔鸡？”波阿莱接了一句。

寡妇把手按着伏脱冷的胸口，说：“心跳得很正常。”

“正常？”波阿莱觉得很诧异。

“是呀，跳得挺好呢。”

“真的吗？”波阿莱问。

“妈妈呀！他就像睡着一样。西尔维已经去请医生了。喂，米旭诺小姐，他把乙醚吸进去了。大概是抽筋。脉搏很好；身体像土耳其人一样棒。小姐，你瞧他胸口的毛多浓；好活到一百岁呢，这家伙！头发也没有脱。哟！是胶在上面的，他戴了假头发，原来的头发是土红色的。听说红头发的人不是好到极点，就是坏到极点！他大概是好的了，他？”

“好！好吊起来。”波阿莱道。

“你是说他好吊在漂亮女人的脖子上吧？”米旭诺小姐抢着说，“你去吧，先生。你们闹了病要人伺候，那就是我们女人的事了。你还是到外边去遛遛吧。这儿有我跟伏盖太太照应就行了。”

波阿莱一声没出，轻轻地走了，好像一条狗给主人踢了一脚。

拉斯蒂涅原想出去走走，换换空气。他闷得发慌。这桩准时发生的罪案，隔夜他明明想阻止的；后来怎么的呢？他应该怎办呢？他唯恐在这件案子中做了共谋犯。想到伏脱冷那种若无其事的态度，他还心有余悸。他私下想：

“要是伏脱冷一声不出就死了呢？”

他穿过卢森堡公园的走道，好似有一群猎犬在背后追他，连它们的咆哮都听得见。

“喂，朋友，”皮安训招呼他，“你有没有看到《舵工报》？”

《舵工报》是天梭先生主办的激进派报纸，在晨报出版后几小时另出一张地方版，登载当天的新闻，在外省比别家报纸的消息要早二十四小时。

高乡医院的实习医生接着说：“有段重要新闻：泰伊番的儿子和前帝国禁卫军的弗朗却西尼伯爵决斗，额上中了一剑，深两寸。这么一来，维多莉小姐成了巴黎最有陪嫁的姑娘了。哼！要是早知道的话！死了个人倒好比开了个头奖！听说维多莉对你很不错，可是真的？”

“别胡说，皮安训，我永远不会娶她。我爱着一个妙人儿，她也爱着我，我……”

“你这么说好像拼命压制自己，唯恐对你的妙人儿不忠实。难道真有什么女人，值得你牺牲泰伊番老头的家私么？倒要请你指给我瞧瞧。”

拉斯蒂涅嚷道：“难道所有的魔鬼都盯着我吗？”

皮安训道：“那么你又在盯谁呢？你疯了么？伸出手来，让我替你按按脉。哟，你在发烧呢。”

“赶快上伏盖妈妈家去吧，”欧也纳说，“刚才伏脱冷那浑蛋晕过去了。”

“啊！我早就疑心，你给我证实了。”皮安训说着，丢下拉斯蒂涅跑了。

拉斯蒂涅溜了大半天，非常严肃。他似乎把良心翻来覆去查看了一遍。尽管他迟疑不决，细细考虑，到底真金不怕火，他的清白总算经得起严格的考验。他记起隔夜高老头告诉他的心腹话，想起但斐纳在阿多阿街替他预备的屋子；拿出信来重新念了一遍，吻了一下，心上想：

“这样的爱情正是我的救星。可怜老头儿有过多少伤心事；他从来不提，可是谁都一目了然！好吧，我要像照顾父亲一般地照顾他，让他享享福。倘使她爱我，她白天会常常到我家里来陪他的。那高个子的雷斯多太太真该死，竟会把老子当作门房看待。亲爱的但斐纳！她对老人家孝顺多了，她是值得我爱的。啊！今晚上我就可以快乐了！”

他掏出表来，欣赏了一番。

“一切都成功了。两个人真正相爱永久相爱的时候，尽可以互相帮助，我尽可以收这个礼。再说，将来我一定飞黄腾达，无论什么我都能百倍地报答她。这样的结合既没有罪过，也没有什么能教最严格的道学家皱一皱眉头的地方。多少正人君子全有这一类的男女关系！我们又不欺骗谁；欺骗才降低我们的人格。扯谎不就表示投降吗？她和丈夫已经分居好久。我可以对那个亚尔萨斯人说，他既然不能使妻子幸福，就应当让给我。”

拉斯蒂涅心里七上八下，争执了很久。虽然青年人的善念终于得胜了，他仍不免在四点半左右，天快黑的时候，存着按捺不下的好奇心，回到发誓要搬走的伏盖公寓。他想看看伏脱冷有没有死。

皮安训把伏脱冷灌了呕吐剂，叫人把吐出来的东西送往医院化验。米旭诺竭力主张倒掉，越发引起皮安训的疑心。并且伏脱冷也复原得太快，皮安训更疑心这个嘻嘻哈哈的家伙是遭了暗算。拉斯蒂涅回来，伏脱冷已经站在饭厅内火炉旁边。包饭客人到得比平时早，因为知道了泰伊番儿子的事，想来打听一番详细情形以及对维多莉的影响。除了高老头，全班人马都在那儿谈论这件新闻。欧也纳进去，正好跟不动声色的伏脱冷打了个照面，被他眼睛一瞪，直瞧到自己心里，挑起一些邪念，使他心惊肉跳，打了个寒噤。那逃犯对他说：

“喂，亲爱的孩子，死神向我认输的日子还长哩。那些太太们说我刚才那场脑充血，连牛都吃不住，我可一点事儿都没有。”

伏盖寡妇叫道：“别说牛，连公牛都受不了。”[18]

“你看我没有死觉得很不高兴吗？”伏脱冷以为看透了拉斯蒂涅的心思，凑着他耳朵说。“那你倒是个狠将了！”

“嗳，真的，”皮安训说，“前天米旭诺小姐提起一个人绰号叫作鬼上当，这个名字对你倒是再合适没有。”

这句话对伏脱冷好似晴天霹雳，他顿时脸色发白，身子晃了几晃，那双勾魂摄魄的眼睛射在米旭诺脸上，好似一道阳光；这股精神的威势吓得她腿都软了，歪歪斜斜地倒在一张椅子里。逃犯扯下平时那张和善的脸，露出狰狞可怖的面目。波阿莱觉得米旭诺遭了危险，赶紧向前，站在她和伏脱冷之间。所有的房客还不知道这出戏是怎么回事，莫名其妙地愣住了。这时外面响起好几个人的脚声，和士兵的枪柄跟街面上的石板碰击的声音。正当高冷不由自主地望着墙壁和窗子，想找出路的时候，客厅门口出现了四个人。为首的便是那特务长，其余三个是警务人员。

“兹以法律与国王陛下之名……”一个警务人员这么念着，以下的话被众人一片惊讶的声音盖住了。

不久，饭厅内寂静无声，房客闪开身子，让三个人走进屋内。他们的手都插在衣袋里，抓着上好子弹的手枪。跟在后面的两个宪兵把守客厅的门；另外两个在通往楼梯道的门口出现。好几个士兵的脚声和枪柄声在前面石子道上响起来。鬼上当完全没有逃走的希望了，所有的目光都不由自主地盯着他一个人。特务长笔直地走过去，对准他的脑袋用力打了一巴掌，把假头发打落了。高冷丑恶的面貌马上显了出来。土红色的短头发表示他的强悍和狡猾，配着跟上半身气息一贯的脑袋和脸庞，意义非常清楚，仿佛被地狱的火焰照亮了。整个的伏脱冷，他的过去、现在、将来，倔强的主张，享乐的人生观，以及玩世不恭的思想、行动，和一切都能担当的体格给他的气魄，大家全明白了。全身的血涌上他的脸，眼睛像野猫一般发亮。他使出一股犷野的力抖擞一下，大吼一声，把所有的房客吓得大叫。一看这个狮子般的动作，暗探们借着众人叫喊的威势，一齐掏出手枪。高冷一见枪上亮晶晶的火门，知道处境危险，便突然一变，表现出人的最高的精神力量。那种场面真是又丑恶又庄严！他脸上的表情只有一个譬喻可以形容，仿佛一口锅炉贮满了足以翻江倒海的水汽，一眨眼之间被一滴冷水化得无影无踪。消灭他一腔怒火的那滴冷水，不过是一个快得像闪电般的念头。他微微一笑，瞧着自己的假头发，对特务长说：

“哼，你今天不客气啊。”

他向那些宪兵点点头，把两只手伸了出来。

“来吧，宪兵，拿手铐来吧。请在场的人做证，我没有抵抗。”

这一幕的经过，好比火山的熔液和火舌突然之间蹿了出来，又突然之间退了回去。满屋的人看了，不由得唧唧哝哝表示惊叹。

逃犯望着那有名的特务长说：“这可破了你的计，你这小题大做的家伙！”

“少废话，衣服剥下来。”那个圣·安纳街的人物满脸瞧不起地吆喝。

高冷说：“干吗？这儿还有女士。我又不赖，我投降了。”

他停了一会，瞧着全场的人，好像一个演说家预备发表惊人的言论。

“你写吧，拉夏班老头。”他招呼一个白头发的矮老头。老人从公事包里掏出逮捕笔录，在桌旁坐下。“我承认是约各·高冷，诨名鬼上当，判过二十年苦役。我刚才证明我并没盗窃虚名，辜负我的外号。”他又对房客们说：“只要我举一举手，这三个奸细就要教我当场出彩，弄脏伏盖妈妈的屋子。这般坏蛋专门暗箭伤人！”

伏盖太太听到这几句大为难受，对西尔维道：“我的天！真要教人吓出病来了；我昨天还跟他上快活剧院呢。”

“放明白些，妈妈，”高冷回答，“难道昨天坐了我的包厢就倒霉了吗？难道你比我们强吗？我们肩膀上背的丑名声，还比不上你们心里的坏主意，你们这些烂社会里的蛆！你们之中最优秀的对我也抵抗不了。”

他的眼睛停在拉斯蒂涅身上，温柔地笑了笑；那笑容同他粗野的表情成为奇怪的对照。

“你知道，我的宝贝，咱们的小交易还是照常，要是接受的话！”说着他唱起来：





我的芳希德多可爱，

你瞧她多么朴实。





“你放心，我自有办法收账。人家怕我，绝不敢揩我的油。”

他这个人，这番话，把苦役监中的风气，亲狎，下流，令人触目惊心的气概，忽而滑稽忽而可怕的谈吐，突然表现了出来。他这个人不仅仅是一个人了，而是一个典型，代表整个堕落的民族，野蛮而又合理，粗暴而又能屈能伸的民族。一刹那间高冷变成一首恶魔的诗，写尽人类所有的情感，只除掉忏悔。他的目光有如撒旦的目光，他像撒旦一样永远要拼个你死我活。拉斯蒂涅低下头去，默认这个罪恶的联系，补赎他过去的邪念。

“谁出卖我的？”高冷的可怕的目光朝着众人扫过去，最后钉住了米旭诺小姐，说道：“哼，是你！假仁假义的老妖精，你暗算我，骗我中风，你这个奸细！我一句话，包你八天之内脑袋搬家。可是我饶你，我是基督徒。而且也不是你出卖我的。那么是谁呢？”

他听见警务人员在楼上打开他的柜子，拿他的东西，便道：“嘿！嘿！你们在上面搜查。鸟儿昨天飞走了，窠也搬空了！你们找不出什么来的。账簿在这儿，”他拍拍脑门，“呃，出卖我的人，我知道了。一定是丝线那个小坏蛋，对不对，捕快先生？”他问特务长。“想起我们把钞票放在这儿的日子，一定是他。哼，什么都没有了，告诉你们这般小奸细！至于丝线哪，不出半个月就要他的命，你们派全部宪兵去保镖也是白搭。——这个米旭诺，你们给了她多少？两三千法郎吧？我可不止值这一些，告诉你这个母夜叉，丑八怪，公墓上的爱神！你要是通知了我，可以到手六千法郎。嗯，你想不到吧，你这个卖人肉的老货！我倒愿意那么办，开销六千法郎，免得旅行一趟，又麻烦，又损失钱。”他一边说一边让人家戴上手铐，“这些家伙要拿我开心，尽量拖延日子，折磨我。要是马上送我进苦役监，我不久就好重新办公，才不怕这些傻瓜的警察老爷呢。在牢里，弟兄们把灵魂翻身都愿意，只要能让他们的大哥走路，让慈悲的鬼上当远走高飞！你们之中可有人像我一样，有一万多弟兄肯替你拼命的？”他骄傲地问，又拍拍心口：“这里面着实有些好东西，我从来没出卖过人！喂，假仁假义的老妖精，”他叫老姑娘，“你瞧他们都怕我，可是你哪，只能教他们恶心。好吧，领你的赏格去吧。”

他停了一会，打量着那些房客，说道：

“你们蠢不蠢，你们！难道从来没见过苦役犯？一个像我高冷气派的苦役犯，可不像别人那样没心没肺。我是卢梭的门徒，我反抗社会契约[19]那样的大骗局。我一个人对付政府，跟上上下下的法院、宪兵、预算作对，弄得他们七荤八素。”

“该死！”画家说，“把他画下来倒是挺美的呢。”

“告诉我，你这刽子手大人的跟班，你这个寡妇总监，”（寡妇是苦役犯替断头台起的又可怕又有诗意的名字），他转身对特务长说，“大家客客气气！告诉我，是不是丝线出卖我的？我不愿意冤枉他，教他替别人抵命。”

这时警务人员在楼上抄遍了他的卧室，一切登记完毕，进来对他们的主任低声说话。逮捕笔录也已经写好。

“诸位，”高冷招呼同住的人，“他们要把我带走了。我在这儿的时候，大家都对我很好，我永远不会忘记。现在告辞了。将来我会寄普罗旺斯[20]的无花果给你们。”

他走了几步，又回头瞧了瞧拉斯蒂涅。

“再会，欧也纳，”他的声音又温柔又凄凉，跟他长篇大论的粗野口吻完全不同，“要有什么为难，我给你留下一个忠心的朋友。”

他虽然戴了手铐，还能摆出剑术教师的架势，喊着“一，二！”[21]然后往前跨了一步，又说：

“有什么倒霉事儿，尽管找他。人手和钱都好调度。”

这怪人的最后几句说得十分滑稽，除了他和拉斯蒂涅之外，谁都不明白。警察、士兵、警务人员一齐退出屋子，西尔维一边用酸醋替女主人擦太阳穴，一边瞧着那般诧异不置的房客，说道：

“不管怎么样，他到底是个好人！”

大家被这一幕引起许多复杂的情绪，迷迷糊糊愣在那里，听了西尔维的话方始惊醒过来，你望着我，我望着你，然后不约而同地把眼睛钉在米旭诺小姐身上。她像木乃伊一样的干瘪，又瘦又冷，缩在火炉旁边，低着眼睛，只恨眼罩的阴影不够遮掩她两眼的表情。众人久已讨厌这张脸，这一下突然明白了讨厌的原因。屋内隐隐然起了一阵嘀咕声，音调一致，表示反感也全场一致。米旭诺听见了，仍旧留在那里。皮安训第一个探过身去对旁边的人轻轻地说：

“要是这婆娘再同我们一桌子吃饭，我可要跑了。”

一刹那间，除了波阿莱，个个人赞成医学生的主张；医学生看见大众同意，走过去对波阿莱说：

“你和米旭诺小姐特别有交情，你去告诉她马上离开这儿。”

“马上？”波阿莱不胜惊讶地重复了一遍。

接着他走到老姑娘身旁，咬了咬她的耳朵。

“我房饭钱完全付清，我出我的钱住在这儿，跟大家一样！”她说完把全体房客毒蛇似的扫了一眼。

拉斯蒂涅说：“那容易得很，咱们来摊还她好了。”

她说：“你先生帮着高冷，哼，我知道为什么。”她瞅着大学生的眼光又恶毒又带着质问的意味。

欧也纳跳起来，仿佛要扑上去掐死老姑娘。米旭诺眼神中那点子阴险，他完全体会到，而他内心深处那些不可告人的邪念，也给米旭诺的目光照得雪亮。

房客们叫道：“别理她。”

拉斯蒂涅抱着手臂，一声不出。

“喂，把犹大小姐的事给了一了吧，”画家对伏盖太太说，“太太，你不请米旭诺走，我们走了，还要到处宣扬，说这儿住的全是苦役犯和奸细。不然的话，我们可以替你瞒着；老实说，这是在最上等的社会里也免不了的，除非在苦役犯额上刺了字，让他们没法冒充巴黎的布尔乔亚去招摇撞骗。”

听到这番议论，伏盖太太好像吃了仙丹，立刻精神抖擞，站起身子，把手臂一抱，睁着雪亮的眼睛，没有一点哭过的痕迹。

“嗳，亲爱的先生，你是不是要我的公寓关门？你瞧伏脱冷先生……哎哟！我的天！”她打住了话头，叫道，“我一开口就叫出他那个冒充规矩人的姓名！……一间屋空了，你们又要叫我多空两间。这时候大家都住定了，要我招租不是抓瞎吗！”

皮安训叫道：“诸位，戴上帽子走吧，上索篷广场弗利谷多饭铺去！”

伏盖太太眼睛一转，马上打好算盘，骨碌碌地一直滚到米旭诺前面。

“喂，我的好小姐，好姑娘，你不见得要我关门吧，嗯？你瞧这些先生把我逼到这个田地；你今晚暂且上楼……”

“不行不行，”房客一齐叫着，“我们要她马上出去。”

“她饭都没吃呢，可怜的小姐。”波阿莱用了哀求的口吻。

“她爱上哪儿吃饭就哪儿吃饭。”好几个声音回答。

“滚出去，奸细！”

“奸细们滚出去！”

波阿莱这脓包突然被爱情鼓足了勇气，说道：“诸位，对女性总得客气一些！”

画家道：“奸细还有什么性别！”

“好一个女性喇嘛！”

“滚出去喇嘛！”

“诸位，这不像话。叫人走路也得有个体统。我们已经付清房饭钱，我们不走。”波阿莱说完，戴上便帽，走去坐在米旭诺旁边一张椅子上；伏盖太太正在说教似的劝她。

画家装着滑稽的模样对波阿莱说：“你放赖，小坏蛋，去你的吧！”

皮安训道：“喂，你们不走，我们走啦。”

房客们一窝蜂向客厅拥去。

伏盖太太嚷道：“小姐，你怎么着？我完了。你不能耽下去，他们会动武呢。”

米旭诺小姐站起身子。

——“她走了！”——“她不走！”——“她走了！”——“她不走！”

此呼彼应的叫喊，对米旭诺越来越仇视的说话，使米旭诺低声同伏盖太太办过交涉以后，不得不走了。

她用恐吓的神气说：“我要上皮诺太太家去。”

“随你，小姐。”伏盖太太回答，她觉得这房客挑的住所对她是恶毒的侮辱，因为皮诺太太的公寓是和她竞争的，所以她最讨厌。“上皮诺家去吧，去试试她的酸酒跟那些饭摊上买来的菜吧。”

全体房客分作两行站着，一点声音都没有。波阿莱好不温柔地望着米旭诺小姐，迟疑不决的神气非常天真，表示他不知怎么办，不知应该跟她走呢还是留在这儿。看米旭诺一走，房客们兴高采烈，又看到波阿莱这个模样，便互相望着哈哈大笑。

画家叫道：“唧，唧，唧，波阿莱，喂，唷，啦，喂唷！”

博物院管事很滑稽地唱起一支流行歌曲的头几句：





动身上叙利亚，那年轻俊俏的杜奴阿……





皮安训道：“走吧，你心里想死了，真叫作：嗜好所在，锲而不舍。”

助教说：“这句维吉尔的名言翻成普通话，就是各人跟着各人的相好走。”

米旭诺望着波阿莱，做了一个挽他手臂的姿势；波阿莱忍不住了，过去搀着老姑娘，引得众人哄堂大笑。

“好啊，波阿莱！”

“这个好波阿莱哪！”

“阿波罗—波阿莱！”

“战神波阿莱！”

“英勇的波阿莱！”

这时进来一个当差，送一封信给伏盖太太。她念完立刻软瘫似的倒在椅子里。

“我的公寓给天雷打了，烧掉算啦。泰伊番的儿子三点钟断了气。我老是巴望那两位太太好，咒那个可怜的小伙子，现在我遭了报应。古的太太和维多莉叫人来拿行李，搬到她父亲家去。泰伊番先生答应女儿招留古的寡妇做伴。哎哟！多了四间空屋，少了五个房客！”她坐下来预备哭了，叫着：“晦气星进了我的门了！”

忽然街上又有车子的声音。

“又是什么倒霉的事来啦。”西尔维道。

高里奥突然出现，红光满面，差不多返老还童了。

“高里奥坐车！”房客一齐说，“真是世界末日到了！”欧也纳坐在一角出神，高老头奔过去抓着他的胳膊，高高兴兴地说：“来啊。”

“你不知道出了事么？”欧也纳回答，“伏脱冷是一个逃犯，刚才给抓了去；泰伊番的儿子死了。”

“哎！那跟我们什么相干？我要同女儿一起吃饭，在你屋子里！听见没有？她等着你呢，来吧！”

他用力抓起拉斯蒂涅的手臂，死拖活拉，好像把拉斯蒂涅当作情妇一般地绑走了。

“咱们吃饭吧。”画家叫着。

每个人拉开椅子，在桌边坐下。

胖子西尔维道：“真是，今天样样倒霉。我的黄豆煮羊肉也烧焦了。也罢，就请你们吃焦的吧。”

伏盖太太看见平时十八个人的桌子只坐了十个，没有勇气说话了；每个人都想法安慰她，逗她高兴。先是包饭客人还在谈伏脱冷和当天的事，不久顺着谈话忽东忽西的方向，扯到决斗、苦役监、司法、牢狱、需要修正的法律等等上去了。说到后来，跟什么高冷、维多莉、泰伊番，早已离开十万八千里。他们十个人叫得二十个人价响，似乎比平时人更多；今天这顿晚饭和隔天那顿晚饭就是这么点儿差别。这批自私的人已经恢复了不关痛痒的态度，等明天再在巴黎的日常事故中另找一个倒霉鬼做他们的牺牲品。便是伏盖太太也听了胖子西尔维的话，存着希望安静下来。

这一天从早到晚对欧也纳是一连串五花八门的幻境；他虽则个性很强，头脑清楚，也不知道怎样整理他的思想；他经过了许多紧张的情绪，上了马车坐在高老头身旁，老人那些快活得异乎寻常的话传到他耳朵里，简直像梦里听到的。

“今儿早上什么都预备好了。咱们三个人就要一块儿吃饭了，一块儿！懂不懂？四年工夫我没有跟我的但斐纳，跟我的小但斐纳吃饭了。这一回她可以整个晚上陪我了。我们从早上起就在你屋子里，我脱了衣衫，像小工一般做活，帮着搬家具。啊！啊！你不知道她在饭桌上才殷勤呢，她曾招呼我：‘嗳，爸爸，尝尝这个，多好吃！’可是我吃不下。噢！已经有那么久，我没有像今晚这样可以舒舒服服同她在一起了！”

欧也纳说：“怎么，今天世界真是翻了身吗？”

高里奥说：“什么翻了身？世界从来没这样好过。我在街上只看见快活的脸，只看见人家在握手，拥抱；大家都高兴得不得了，仿佛全要上女儿家吃饭，吃一顿好饭似的。你知道，她是当我的面向英国咖啡馆的总管点的菜。嗳！在她身边，黄连也会变成甘草咧。”

“我现在才觉得活过来了。”欧也纳道。

“喂，马夫，快一点呀，”高老头推开前面的玻璃叫，“快点儿，十分钟赶到，我给五法郎酒钱。”

马夫听着，加了几鞭，他的马便在巴黎街上闪电似的飞奔起来。

高老头说：“他简直不行，这马夫。”

拉斯蒂涅问道：“你带我上哪儿去啊？”

高老头回答：“你府上啰。”

车子在阿多阿街停下。老人先下车，丢了十法郎给马夫，那种阔绰活现出一个单身汉得意之极，什么都不在乎。

“来，咱们上去吧。”他带着拉斯蒂涅穿过院子，走上三楼的一个公寓，在一幢外观很体面的新屋子的后半边。高老头不用打铃。特·纽沁根太太的老妈子丹兰士已经来开门了。欧也纳看到一所单身汉住的精雅的屋子，包括穿堂、小客厅、卧室和一间面临花园的书房。小客厅的家具和装修，精雅无比。在烛光下面，欧也纳看见但斐纳从壁炉旁边一张椅子上站起来，把遮火的团扇[22]放在壁炉架上，声音非常温柔地招呼他：

“非得请你才来吗，你这位莫名其妙的先生！”

丹兰士出去了。大学生搂着但斐纳紧紧抱着，快活得哭了。这一天，多少刺激使他的心和头脑都疲倦不堪，加上眼前的场面和公寓里的事故对比之下，拉斯蒂涅更加容易激动。

“我知道他是爱你的。”高老头悄悄地对女儿说。欧也纳软瘫似的倒在沙发上，一句话都说不出来，也弄不清这最后一幕幻境，怎么变出来的。

“你来瞧瞧。”特·纽沁根太太抓了他的手，带他走进一间屋子，其中的地毯，器具，一切细节都教他想到但斐纳家里的卧房，不过小了一点。

“还少一张床。”拉斯蒂涅说。

“是的，先生。”她红着脸，紧紧握了握他的手。

欧也纳望着但斐纳，他还年轻，懂得女人动了爱情自有真正的羞恶之心表现出来。他附在她耳边说：

“你这种妙人儿值得人家一辈子的疼爱。我敢说这个话，因为我们俩心心相印。爱情越热烈越真诚，越应当含蓄隐蔽，不露痕迹。我们决不能对外人泄露秘密。”

“哦！我不是什么外人啊，我！”高老头咕噜着说。

“那你知道你便是我们……”

“对啦，我就希望这样。你们不会提防我的，是不是？我走来走去，像一个无处不在的好天使，你们只知道有他，可是看不见他。嗳，但斐纳，尼纳德，但但尔！我当初告诉你：阿多阿街有所漂亮屋子，替他布置起来吧！——不是说得很对么？你还不愿意。啊！你的生命是我给的，你的快乐还是我给的。做父亲的要幸福，就得永远地给。永远地给，这才是父亲的所以成其为父亲。”

“怎么呢？”欧也纳问。

“是呀，她早先不愿意，怕人家说闲话，仿佛‘人家’抵得上自己的幸福！所有的女人都恨不得要学但斐纳的样呢……”

高老头一个人在那儿说话，特·纽沁根太太带拉斯蒂涅走进书房，给人听到一个亲吻的声音，虽是那么轻轻的一吻。书房和别间屋子一样精雅；每间屋里的动用器具也已经应有尽有。

“你说，我们是不是猜中了你的心意？”她回到客厅吃晚饭时问。

“当然。这种全套的奢华，这些美梦的实现，年少风流的生活的诗意，我都彻底领会到，不至于没有资格享受；可是我不能受你，我还太穷，不能……”

“嗯嗯！你已经在反抗我了。”她装着半正经半玩笑的神气说，有样地噘着嘴。逢到男人有所顾虑的时候，女人多半用这个方法对付。

欧也纳这一天非常严肃地考问过自己，伏脱冷的被捕又使他发觉差点儿一失足成千古恨，因此加强了他的高尚的心胸与骨气，不愿轻易接受礼物。但斐纳尽管撒娇，和他争执，他也不肯让步。他只觉得非常悲哀。

“怎么！”特·纽沁根太太说，“你不肯受？你不肯受是什么意思，你知道吗？那表示你怀疑我们的前途，不敢和我结合。你怕有朝一日会欺骗我！倘使你爱我，倘使我……爱你，干吗你对这么一些薄意就不敢受？要是你知道我怎样高兴替你布置这个单身汉的家，你就不会推三阻四，马上要向我道歉了。你有钱存在我这儿，我把这笔钱花得很正当，不就得了吗？你自以为胸襟宽大，其实并不。你所要求的还远不止这些……（她瞥见欧也纳有道热情奋发的目光）而为了区区小事就扭捏起来。倘使你不爱我，那么好，就别接受。我的命运只凭你一句话。你说呀！”她停了一会，转过来向她父亲说：“喂，父亲，你开导开导他。难道他以为我对于我们的名誉不像他那么顾虑吗？”

高老头看着，听着这场怪有意思的拌嘴，傻支支地笑着。

但斐纳抓着欧也纳的手臂又说：“孩子，你正走到人生的大门，碰到多数男人没法打破的关口，现在一个女人替你打开了，你退缩了！你知道，你是会成功的，你能挣一笔大大的家业；瞧你美丽的额角，明明是飞黄腾达的相貌。今天欠我的，那时不是可以还我么？古时宫堡里的美人不是把盔甲、刀剑、骏马供给骑士，让他们用她的名义到处去比武吗？嗳！欧也纳，我此刻送给你的是现代的武器，胸怀大志的人必不可少的工具。哼，你住的阁楼也够体面的了，倘使跟爸爸的屋子相像的话。哎，哎！咱们不吃饭了吗？你要我心里难受是不是？你回答我呀！”她摇摇他的手。“天哪！爸爸，你来叫他打定主意，要不然我就走了，从此不见他了。”

高老头从迷惘中醒过来，说道：“好，让我来叫你决定。亲爱的欧也纳先生，你不是会向犹太人借钱吗？”

“那是不得已呀。”

“好，就要你说这句话，”老人说着，掏出一只破皮夹，“那么我来做犹太人。这些账单是我付的，你瞧。屋子里全部的东西，账都清了。也不是什么大数目，至多五千法郎，算是我借给你的。我不是女人，你总不会拒绝了吧。随便写个字做凭据，将来还我就行啦。”

几颗眼泪同时在欧也纳和但斐纳眼中打转，他们俩面面相觑，愣住了。拉斯蒂涅握着老人的手。

高里奥道：“哎哟，怎么！你们不是我的孩子吗？”

特·纽沁根太太道：“可怜的父亲，你哪儿来的钱呢？”

“嗳！问题就在这里。你听了我的话决意把他放在身边，像办嫁妆似的买东买西，我就想：她要为难了！代理人说，向你丈夫讨回财产的官司要拖到六个月以上。好！我就卖掉长期年金一千三百五十法郎的本金；拿出一万五存了一千二的终身年金[23]，有可靠的担保；余下的本金付了你们的账。我么，这儿楼上有间每年一百五十法郎的屋子，每天花上两法郎，日子就过得像王爷一样，还能有多余。我什么都不用添置，也不用做衣服。半个月以来我肚里笑着想：他们该多么快活啊！嗯，你们不是快活吗？”

“哦！爸爸，爸爸！”特·纽沁根太太扑在父亲膝上，让他抱着。

她拼命吻着老人，金黄的头发在他腮帮上厮磨，把那张光彩奕奕、眉飞色舞的老脸洒满了眼泪。

她说：“亲爱的父亲，你才是一个父亲！天下哪找得出第二个像你这样的父亲！欧也纳已经非常爱你，现在更要爱你了！”

高老头有十年工夫，不曾觉得女儿的心贴在他的心上跳过，他说：“噢！孩子们，噢，小但斐纳，你叫我快活死了！我的心胀破了。喂！欧也纳先生，咱们两讫了！”

老人抱着女儿，发疯似的蛮劲使她叫起来：

“哎，你把我掐痛了。”

“把你掐痛了？”他说着，脸色发了白，瞅着她，痛苦得了不得。这个父性基督的面目，只有大画家笔下的耶稣受难的图像可以相比。高老头轻轻地亲吻女儿的脸，亲着他刚才掐得太重的腰部。他又笑盈盈地，带着探问的口吻：

“不，不，我没有掐痛你；倒是你那么叫嚷使我难受。”他一边小心翼翼地亲着女儿，一边咬着她耳朵：“花的钱不止这些呢，咱们得瞒着他，要不然他会生气的。”

老人的牺牲精神简直无穷无尽，使欧也纳愣住了，只能不胜钦佩地望着他。那种天真的钦佩在青年人心中就是有信仰的表现。

他叫道：“我决不辜负你们。”

“噢，欧也纳，你说的好。”特·纽沁根太太亲了亲他的额角。

高老头道：“他为了你，拒绝了泰伊番小姐和她的几百万家私。是的，那姑娘是爱你的；现在她哥哥一死，她就和克莱宙斯一样有钱了[24]。”

拉斯蒂涅道：“呃！提这个做什么！”

“欧也纳，”但斐纳凑着他的耳朵说，“今晚上我还觉得美中不足。可是我多爱你，永远爱你！”

高老头叫道：“你们出嫁到现在，今天是我最快乐的日子了。好天爷要我受多少苦都可以，只要不是你们教我受的。将来我会想道：今年二月里我有过一次幸福，那是别人一辈子都没有的。你瞧我啊，但斐纳！”他又对欧也纳说：“你瞧她多美！你有没有碰到过有她那样好看的皮色，小小的酒窝的女人？没有，是不是？嗳，这个美人儿是我生出来的呀。从今以后，你给了她幸福，她还要漂亮呢。欧也纳，你如果要我的那份儿天堂，我给你就是，我可以进地狱。吃饭吧，吃饭吧，”他嚷着，不知道自己说些什么，“啊，一切都是咱们的了。”

“可怜的父亲！”

“我的儿啊，”他起来向她走去，捧着她的头亲她的头发，“你不知道要我快乐多么容易！只要不时来看我一下，我老是在上面，你走一步路就到啦。你得答应我。”

“是的，亲爱的父亲。”

“再说一遍。”

“是的，好爸爸。”

“行啦行啦，由我的性子，会教你说上一百遍。咱们吃饭吧。”

整个黄昏大家像小孩子一样闹着玩儿，高老头的疯癫也不下于他们俩。他躺在女儿脚下，亲她的脚，老半天盯着她的眼睛，把脑袋在她衣衫上厮磨；总之他像一个极年轻极温柔的情人一样疯魔。

“你瞧，”但斐纳对欧也纳道，“我们和父亲在一起，就得整个儿给他。有时的确麻烦得很。”

这句话是一切忘恩负义的根源，可是欧也纳已经几次三番妒忌老人，也就不能责备她了。他向四下里望了望，问：

“屋子什么时候收拾完呢？今晚我们还得分手么？”

“是的。明儿你来陪我吃饭，”她对他使了个眼色，“那是意大利剧院上演的日子。”

高老头道：“那么我去买楼下的座儿。”

时间已经到半夜。特·纽沁根太太的车早已等着。高老头和大学生回到伏盖家，一路谈着但斐纳，越谈越上劲，两股强烈的热情在那里互相比赛。欧也纳看得很清楚，父爱绝对不受个人利害的玷污，父爱的持久不变和广大无边，远过于情人的爱。在父亲心目中，偶像永远纯洁，美丽，过去的一切，将来的一切，都能加强他的崇拜。他们回家发现伏盖太太待在壁炉旁边，在西尔维和克利斯朵夫之间。老房东坐在那儿，好比玛里于斯坐在迦太基的废墟之上。[25]她一边对西尔维诉苦，一边等待两个硕果仅存的房客。虽然拜伦把泰斯[26]的怨叹描写得很美，以深刻和真实而论，远远不及伏盖太太的怨叹呢。

“明儿早上只要预备三杯咖啡了，西尔维！屋子里荒荒凉凉的，怎么不伤心？没有了房客还像什么生活！公寓里的人一下子全跑光了。生活就靠那些衣食饭碗呀。我犯了什么天条要遭这样的飞来横祸呢？咱们的豆子和番薯都是预备二十个人吃的。想不到还要招警察上门！咱们只能尽吃番薯的了！只能把克利斯朵夫歇掉的了！”

克利斯朵夫从睡梦中惊醒过来，问了声：

“太太？”

“可怜的家伙！简直像条看家狗。”西尔维道。

“碰到这个淡月，大家都安顿好了，哪还有房客上门？真叫我急疯了。米旭诺那老妖精把波阿莱也给拐走了！她对他怎么的，居然叫他服服帖帖，像小狗般跟着就走？”

“哟！”西尔维侧了侧脑袋，“那些老姑娘自有一套鬼本领。”

“那个可怜的伏脱冷先生，他们说是苦役犯，嗳，西尔维，怎么说我还不信呢。像他那样快活的人，一个月喝十五法郎的葛洛莉亚，付账又从来不脱期！”

克利斯朵夫道：“又那么慷慨！”

西尔维道：“大概弄错了吧？”

“不，他自己招认了，”伏盖太太回答，“想不到这样的事会出在我家里，连一只猫儿都看不见的区域里！真是，我在做梦了。咱们眼看路易十六出了事，眼看皇帝[27]下了台，眼看他回来了又倒下去了，这些都不稀奇；可是有什么理由教包饭公寓遭殃呢？咱们可以不要王上，却不能不吃饭；龚弗冷家的好姑太太把好茶好饭款待客人……。除非世界到了末日……唉，对啦，真是世界的末日到啦。”

西尔维叫道：“再说那米旭诺小姐，替你惹下了大祸，反而拿到三千法郎年金！”

伏盖太太道：“甭提了，简直是个女流氓！还要火上加油，住到皮诺家去！哼，她什么都做得出，一定干过混账事儿，杀过人，偷过东西，倒是她该送进苦役监，代替那个可怜的好人……”

说到这里，欧也纳和高老头打铃了。

“啊！两个有义气的房客回来了。”伏盖太太说着，叹了口气。

两个有义气的房客已经记不大清公寓里出的乱子，直截了当地向房东宣布要搬往唐打区。

“唉，西尔维，”寡妇说，“我最后的王牌也完啦。你们两位要了我的命了！简直是当胸一棍。我这里好似有根铁棒压着。真的，我要发疯了。那些豆子又怎么办？啊！好，要是只剩下我一个人，你明儿也该走了，克利斯朵夫。再会吧，先生们，再会吧。”

“她怎么啦？”欧也纳问西尔维。

“噢！出了那些事，大家都跑了，她急坏了。哎，听呀，她哭起来了。哭一下对她倒是好的。我服侍她到现在，还是第一回看见她落眼泪呢。”

第二天，伏盖太太像她自己所说的，想明白了。固然她损失了所有的房客，生活弄得七颠八倒，非常伤心，可是她神志很清，表示真正的痛苦，深刻的痛苦，利益受到损害，习惯受到破坏的痛苦是怎么回事。一个情人对情妇住过的地方，在离开的时候那副留恋不舍的目光，也不见得比伏盖太太望着空荡荡的饭桌的眼神更凄惨。欧也纳安慰她，说皮安训住院实习的时期几天之内就满了，一定会填补他的位置；还有博物院管事常常羡慕古的太太的屋子；总而言之，她的人马不久仍旧会齐的。

“但愿上帝听你的话，亲爱的先生！不过晦气进了我的屋子，十天以内必有死神光临，你等着瞧吧，”她把阴惨惨的目光在饭厅内扫了一转，“不知轮着哪一个！”

“还是搬家的好。”欧也纳悄悄地对高老头说。

“太太，”西尔维慌慌张张跑来，“三天不看见咪斯蒂格里了。”

“啊！好，要是我的猫死了，要是它离开了我们，我……”

可怜的寡妇没有把话说完，合着手仰在椅背上，被这个可怕的预兆吓坏了。

两个女儿


晌午，正当邮差走到先贤祠区域的时候，欧也纳收到一封封套很精致的信，火漆上印着鲍赛昂家的纹章。信内附一份给特·纽沁根夫妇的请帖；一个月以前预告的盛大的舞会快举行了。另外有个字条给欧也纳：


“我想，先生，你一定很高兴代我向特·纽沁根太太致意。我特意寄上你要求的请柬，我很乐意认识特·雷斯多太太的妹妹。替我陪这个美人儿来吧，希望你别让她把你的全部感情占了去，你该回敬我的着实不少哩。

特·鲍赛昂子爵夫人。”



欧也纳把这封短简念了两遍，想道：“特·鲍赛昂太太明明表示不欢迎特·纽沁根男爵。”

他赶紧上但斐纳家，很高兴能给她这种快乐，说不定还会得到酬报呢。特·纽沁根太太正在洗澡。拉斯蒂涅在内客室等。一个想情人想了两年的急色儿，等在那里当然极不耐烦。这等情绪，年轻人也不会碰到第二次。男人对于他所爱的第一个十足地道的女子，就是说符合巴黎社会的条件的，光彩耀目的女子，永远觉得天下无双。巴黎的爱情和旁的爱情没有一点儿相同。每个人为了体统关系，在所谓毫无利害作用的感情上所标榜的门面话，男男女女是没有一个人相信的。在这儿，女人不但应当满足男人的心灵和肉体，而且还有更大的义务，要满足人生无数的虚荣。巴黎的爱情尤其需要吹捧、无耻、浪费、哄骗、摆阔。在路易十四的宫廷中，所有的妇女都羡慕拉·华梨哀小姐，因为她的热情使那位名君忘了他的袖饰值到六千法郎一对，把它撕破了来汲引特·凡尔蒙陶阿公爵。[1]以此为例，我们对别人还有什么话可说呢！你得年轻，有钱，有头衔，要是可能，金钱名位越显赫越好；你在偶像面前上的香越多，假定你能有一个偶像的话，她越宠你。爱情是一种宗教，信奉这个宗教比信奉旁的宗教代价高得多；并且很快就会消失，信仰过去的时候像一个顽皮的孩子，还得到处闯些祸。感情这种奢侈唯有阁楼上的穷小子才有；除了这种奢侈，真正的爱还剩下什么呢？倘若巴黎社会那些严格的法规有什么例外，那只能在孤独生活中，在不受人情世故支配的心灵中找到。这些心灵仿佛是靠近明净的，瞬息即逝而不绝如缕的泉水过活的；他们守着绿荫，乐于倾听另一世界的语言，他们觉得这是身内身外到处都能听到的；他们一边怨叹浊世的枷锁，一边耐心等待自己的超升。拉斯蒂涅却像多数青年一样，预先体验到权势的滋味，打算有了全副武装再跃登人生的战场，他已经染上社会的狂热，也许觉得有操纵社会的力量，但既不明白这种野心的目的，也不知道实现野心的方法。要是没有纯洁和神圣的爱情充实一个人的生命，那么，对权势的渴望也能促成美妙的事业——只要能摆脱一切个人的利害，以国家的光荣为目标。可是大学生还没有达到瞻望人生而加以批判的程度。在外省长大的儿童往往有些清新隽永的念头，像绿荫一般荫庇他们的青春，至此为止拉斯蒂涅还对那些念头有所留恋。他老是踌躇不决，不敢放胆在巴黎下海。尽管好奇心很强，他骨子里仍忘不了一个真正的乡绅在古堡中的幸福生活。虽然如此，他隔夜逗留在新屋子里的时候，最后一些顾虑已经消灭。前一个时期他已经靠着出身到处沾光，如今又添上一个物质优裕的条件，使他把外省人的壳完全脱掉了，悄悄地爬到一个地位，看到一个美妙的前程。因此，在这间可以说一半是他的内客室中懒洋洋地等着但斐纳，欧也纳觉得自己和去年初到巴黎时大不相同，回顾之下，他自问是否换了一个人。

“太太在寝室里。”丹兰士进来报告，吓了他一跳。

但斐纳横在壁炉旁边一张双人沙发上，气色鲜艳，精神饱满；罗绮被体的模样令人想到印度那些美丽的植物，花还没有谢，果子已经结了。

“哎，你瞧，咱们又见面了。”她很感动地说。

“猜猜我给你带了什么来着。”欧也纳说着，坐在她身旁，拿起她的手亲吻。

特·纽沁根太太念着请帖，做了一个快乐的手势。虚荣心满足了，她水汪汪的眼睛望着欧也纳，把手臂勾着他的脖子，发狂似的把他拉过来。

“倒是你（好宝贝！她凑上耳朵叫了一声。丹兰士在更衣室里，咱们得小心些！），倒是你给了我这个幸福！是的，我管这个叫作幸福。从你那儿得来的，当然不光是自尊心的满足。没有人肯介绍我进那个社会。也许你觉得我渺小，虚荣，轻薄，像一个巴黎女子；可是你知道，朋友，我准备为你牺牲一切；我所以格外想踏进圣·日耳曼区，还是因为你在那个社会里。”

“你不觉得吗，”欧也纳问，“特·鲍赛昂太太暗示她不预备在舞会里见到特·纽沁根男爵？”

“是啊，”男爵夫人把信还给欧也纳，“那些太太就有这种放肆的天才。可是管他，我要去的。我姊姊也要去，她正在打点一套漂亮的服装。”她又放低了声音说，“告诉你，欧也纳，因为外边有闲话，她特意要去露露面。你不知道关于她的谣言吗？今儿早上纽沁根告诉我，昨天俱乐部里公开谈着她的事，天哪！女人的名誉，家庭的名誉，真是太脆弱了！姊姊受到侮辱，我也跟着丢了脸。听说特·脱拉伊先生签在外边的借票有十万法郎，都到了期，要被人控告了。姊姊迫不得已把她的钻石卖给一个犹太人，那些美丽的钻石你一定看见她戴过，还是她婆婆传下来的呢。总而言之，这两天大家只谈论这件事儿。难怪阿娜斯大齐要定做一件金银线织锦缎的衣衫，到鲍府去出风头，戴着她的钻石给人看。我不愿意被她比下去。她老是想压倒我，从来没有对我好过；我帮过她多少忙，她没有钱的时候总给她通融。好啦，别管闲事了，今天我要痛痛快快地乐一下。”

早上一点，拉斯蒂涅还在特·纽沁根太太家，她恋恋不舍地和他告别，暗示未来的欢乐的告别。她很伤感地说：

“我真害怕，真迷信；不怕你笑话，我只觉得心惊胆战，唯恐我消受不了这个福气，要碰到什么飞来横祸。”

欧也纳道：“孩子！”

她笑道：“啊！今晚是我变作孩子了。”

欧也纳回到伏盖家，想到明天一定能搬走，又回味着刚才的幸福，便像许多青年一样，一路上做了许多美梦。

高老头等拉斯蒂涅走过房门的时候问道：“喂，怎么呢？”

“明儿跟你细谈。”

“从头至尾都得告诉我啊。好，去睡吧，明儿咱们开始过快乐生活了。”

第二天，高里奥和拉斯蒂涅只等运输行派人来，就好离开公寓。不料中午时分，圣·日内维新街上忽然来了一辆车，停在伏盖家门口。特·纽沁根太太下来，打听父亲是否还在公寓。西尔维回答说是，她便急急上楼。欧也纳正在自己屋里，他的邻居却没有知道。吃中饭的时候，他托高老头代搬行李，约定四点钟在阿多阿街相会。老人出去找搬夫，欧也纳匆匆到学校去应了卯，又回来和伏盖太太算账，不愿意把这件事去累高老头，恐怕他固执，要代付欧也纳的账。房东太太不在家。欧也纳上楼瞧瞧有没有忘了东西，发觉这个念头转得不差，因为在抽斗内找出那张当初给伏脱冷的不写抬头人的借据，还是清偿那天随手扔下的。因为没有火，正想把借据撕掉，他忽然听出但斐纳的口音，便不愿意再有声响，马上停下来听，以为但斐纳不会再有什么秘密要隐瞒他的了。刚听了几个字，他觉得父女之间的谈话出入重大，不能不留神听下去。

“啊！父亲，”她道，“怎么老天爷没有叫你早想到替我追究产业，弄得我现在破产！我可以说话么？”

“说吧，屋子里没有人。”高老头声音异样地回答。

“你怎么啦，父亲？”

老人说：“你这是给我当头一棒。上帝饶恕你，孩子！你不知道我多爱你，你知道了就不会脱口而出，说这样的话了，况且事情还没有到绝望的地步。有什么大不了的事，教你这时候赶到这儿来？咱们不是等会就在阿多阿街相会吗？”

“唉！父亲，大祸临头，顷刻之间还做得了什么主！我急坏了！你的代理人把早晚要发觉的倒霉事儿，提早发觉了。你生意上的老经验马上用得着；我跑来找你，好比一个人淹在水里，哪怕一根树枝也抓着不放的了。但尔维先生看到纽沁根种种刁难，便拿起诉恐吓他，说法院立刻会批准分产的要求。纽沁根今天早上到我屋里来，问我是不是要同他两个一齐破产。我回答说，这些事我完全不懂，我只晓得有我的一份产业，应当由我掌管，一切交涉都该问我的诉讼代理人，我自己什么都不明白，什么都不能谈。你不是吩咐我这样说的吗？”

高老头回答说：“对！”

“唉！可是他告诉我生意的情形。据说他拿我们两人的资本一齐放进了才开头的企业，为了那个企业，必得放出大宗款子在外边。倘若我强迫他还我陪嫁，他就要宣告清理；要是我肯等一年，他以名誉担保能还我几倍或者三倍的财产，因为他把我的钱经营了地产，等那笔买卖结束了，我就可以支配我的全部产业。亲爱的父亲，他说得很真诚，我听着害怕了。他求我原谅他过去的行为，愿意让我自由，答应我爱怎办就怎办，只要让他用我的名义全权管理那些事业。为证明他的诚意，他说确定我产权的文件，我随时可以托但尔维先生检查。总之他自己缚手缚脚地交给我了。他要求再当两年家，求我除了他规定的数目以外，绝对不花钱。他对我证明，他所能办到的只是保全面子，他已经打发了他的舞女，不得不尽量暗中撙节，才能支持到投机事业结束，而不至于动摇信用。我跟他闹，装作完全不信，一步一步地逼他，好多知道些事情；他给我看账簿，最后他哭了，我从来没看见一个男人落到那副模样。他急坏了，说要自杀，疯疯癫癫地教我看了可怜。”

“你相信他的胡扯吗？”高老头叫道，“他这是做戏！我生意上碰到过德国人，几乎每个都规矩，老实，天真；可是一朝装着老实样儿跟你耍手段、耍无赖的时候，他们比别人更凶。你丈夫哄你。他觉得给你逼得无路可走了，便装死；他要假借你的名义，因为比他自己出面更自由。他想利用这一点规避生意上的风波。他又坏又刁，真不是东西。不行，不行！看到你两手空空我是不愿意进坟墓的。我还懂得些生意经。他说把资金放在某些企业上，好吧，那么他的款子一定有证券、借票、合同等等做凭据！叫他拿出来跟你算账！咱们会挑最好的投机事业去做，要冒险也让咱们自己来。咱们要拿到追认文书，写明但斐纳·高里奥，特·纽沁根男爵的妻子，产业自主。他把我们当傻瓜吗，这家伙？他以为我知道你没有了财产，没有了饭吃，能够忍受到两天吗？唉！我一天，一夜，两小时都受不了！你要真落到那个田地，我还能活吗？嗳，怎么，我忙上四十年，背着面粉袋，冒着大风大雨，舍不得吃，舍不得穿，样样为了你们，为我的两个天使——我只要看到你们，所有的辛苦，所有的重担都轻松了；而今日之下，我的财产，我的一辈子都变成一阵烟！真是气死我了！凭着天上地下所有的神灵起誓，咱们非弄个明白不可，非把账目、银箱、企业，统统清查不可！要不是有凭有据，知道你的财产分文不缺，我还能睡觉吗？还能躺下去吗？还能吃东西吗？谢谢上帝，幸亏婚书上写明你是财产独立的；幸亏有但尔维先生做你的代理人，他是一个规矩人。请上帝做证！你非到老都有你那一百万家私不可，非有你每年五万法郎的收入不可，要不然我就在巴黎闹他一个满城风雨，嘿！嘿！法院要不公正，我向国会请愿。知道你在银钱方面太平无事，才会减轻我的一切病痛，才能排遣我的悲伤。钱是性命。有了钱就有了一切。他对我们胡扯些什么，这亚尔萨斯死胖子？但斐纳，对这只胖猪，一个子儿都不能让，他从前拿锁链缚着你，磨得你这么苦。现在他要你帮忙了吧，好！咱们来抽他一顿，叫他老实一点。天哪，我满头是火，脑壳里有些东西烧起来了。怎么，我的但斐纳躺在草垫上！噢！我的斐斐纳！——该死！我的手套呢？哎，走吧，我要去把什么都看个清楚，账簿，营业，银箱，信札，而且当场立刻！直要知道你财产没有了危险，经我亲眼看过了，我才放心。”

“亲爱的父亲！得小心哪。倘若你想借这件事出气，显出过分跟他作对的意思，我就完啦。他是知道你的，认为我担心财产，完全是出于你的授意。我敢打赌，他不但现在死抓我的财产，而且还要抓下去。这流氓会拿了所有的资金，丢下我们溜之大吉的，他也知道我不肯因为要追究他而丢我自己的脸。他又狠又没有骨头。我把一切都想透了。逼他太甚，我是要破产的。”

“难道他是个骗子吗？”

“唉！是的，父亲，”她倒在椅子里哭了，“我一向不愿意对你说，免得你因为把我嫁了这种人而伤心！他的良心，他的私生活，他的精神，他的肉体，都是搭配好的！简直可怕，我又恨他又瞧不起他。你想，下流的纽沁根对我说了那番话，我还能敬重他吗？在生意上干得出那种勾当的人是没有一点儿顾虑的；因为我看透了他的心思，我才害怕。他明明白白答应我，他，我的丈夫，答应我自由，你懂得是什么意思？就是说我要在他倒霉的时候肯让他利用，肯出头顶替，他可以让我自由。”

高老头叫道：“可是还有法律哪！还有葛兰佛广场给这等女婿预备着呢；要没有刽子手，我就亲自动手，割下他的脑袋。”

“不，父亲，没有什么法律能对付这个人的。丢开他的花言巧语，听听他骨子里的话吧！——要你就完事大吉，一个子儿都没有，因为我不能丢了你而另外找个同党；要你就让我干下去，把事情弄成功。——这还不明白吗？他还需要我呢。我的为人他是放心的，知道我不会要他的财产，只想保住我自己的一份。我为了避免破产，不得不跟他做这种不清白的、盗窃式的勾结。他收买我的良心，代价是听凭我同欧也纳自由来往。——我允许你胡来，你得让我犯罪，教那些可怜虫倾家荡产！——这话还说得不明白吗？你知道他所谓的企业是怎么回事？他买进空地，教一些傀儡去盖屋子。他们一方面跟许多营造厂订分期付款的合同，一方面把屋子低价卖给我丈夫。然后他们向营造厂宣告破产，赖掉未付的款子。纽沁根银号这块牌子把可怜的营造商骗上了。这一点我是懂得的，我也懂得。为预防有朝一日要证明他已经付过大宗款子，纽沁根把巨额的证券送到了阿姆斯特丹、拿波里、维也纳。咱们怎么能抢回来呢？”

欧也纳听见高老头沉重的膝盖声，大概是跪在地下了。

老头儿叫道：“我的上帝，我什么地方触犯了你，女儿才会落在这个浑蛋手里，由他摆布？孩子，原谅我吧！”

但斐纳道：“是的，我陷入泥坑，或许也是你的过失。我们出嫁的时候都没有头脑！社会，买卖，男人，品格，我们懂了哪一样？做父亲的应该代我们考虑。亲爱的父亲，我不埋怨你，原谅我说出那样的话。一切都是我的错。得了，爸爸，别哭啦。”她亲着老人的额角。

“你也别哭啦，我的小但斐纳。把你的眼睛给我，让我亲一亲，抹掉你的眼泪。好吧！我去找那大头鬼，把他一团糟的事理出个头绪来。”

“不，还是让我来吧；我会对付他。他还爱我呢！唉！好吧，我要利用这一点影响，教他马上放一部分资金在不动产上面。说不定我能教他用纽沁根太太的名义，在亚尔萨斯买些田，他是看重本乡的。不过明儿你得查一查他的账目跟业务。但尔维先生完全不懂生意一道。哦，不，不要明天，我不愿意惹动肝火。特·鲍赛昂太太的跳舞会就在后天，我要调养得精神饱满，格外好看，替亲爱的欧也纳挣点儿面子！来，咱们去瞧瞧他的屋子。”

一辆车在圣·日内维新街停下，楼梯上传来特·雷斯多太太的声音。“我父亲在家吗？”她问西尔维。

这一下倒是替欧也纳解了围，他本想倒在床上装睡了。

但斐纳听出姊姊的口音，说道：“啊！父亲，没有人和你提到阿娜斯大齐吗？仿佛她家里也出了事呢。”

“怎么！”高老头道，“那是我末日到了。真叫作祸不单行，可怜我怎么受得了呢！”

“你好，父亲。”伯爵夫人进来叫：“哟！你在这里，但斐纳。”

特·雷斯多太太看到了妹妹，局促不安。

“你好，娜齐。你觉得我在这儿奇怪吗？我是跟父亲天天见面的，我。”

“从哪时起的？”

“要是你来这儿，你就知道了。”

“别挑错儿啦，但斐纳，”伯爵夫人的声音差不多要哭出来，“我苦极了，我完了，可怜的父亲！哦！这一次真完了！”

“怎么啦，娜齐？”高老头叫起来，“说给我们听吧，孩子。哎哟，她脸色不对了。但斐纳，快，快去扶住她，小乖乖，你对她好一点，我更喜欢你。”

“可怜的娜齐，”但斐纳扶着姊姊坐下，说，“你讲吧！你瞧，世界上只有我们俩始终爱着你，一切原谅你。瞧见没有，骨肉的感情才是最可靠的。”她给伯爵夫人嗅了盐，醒过来了。

“我要死啦，”高老头道，“来，你们俩都走过来。我冷啊。”他拨着炭火。“什么事，娜齐？快快说出来。你要我的命了………”

“唉！我丈夫全知道了。父亲，你记得上回玛克辛那张借票吗？那不是他的第一批债。我已经替他还过不少。正月初，我看他愁眉苦脸，对我什么都不说；可是爱人的心事最容易看透，一点儿小事就够了，何况还有预感。他那时格外多情，格外温柔，我总是一次比一次快乐。可怜的玛克辛！他后来告诉我，原来他暗中和我诀别，想自杀。我拼命逼他，苦苦央求，在他前面跪了两小时，他才说出欠了十万法郎！哦！爸爸，十万法郎！我疯了。你拿不出这笔钱，我又什么都花光了……”

“是的，”高老头说，“我没有办法，除非去偷。可是我会去偷的呀，娜齐！会去偷的呀！”

姊妹俩听着不出声了。这句凄惨的话表示父亲的感情无能为力，到了痛苦绝望的地步，像一个人临终的痰厥，也像一颗石子丢进深渊，显出它的深度。天下还有什么自私自利的人，能够听了无动于衷呢？

“因此，父亲，我挪用了别人的东西，筹到了款子。”伯爵夫人哭着说。

但斐纳感动了，把头靠在姊姊的脖子上，她也哭了。

“那么外边的话都是真的了？”但斐纳问。

娜齐低下头去，但斐纳抱着她，温柔地亲吻，把她搂在胸口，说道：

“我心中对你只有爱，没有责备。”

高老头有气无力地说：“你们两个小天使，干吗直要患难临头才肯和好呢？”

伯爵夫人受着热情的鼓励，又道：“为了救玛克辛的命，也为了救我的幸福，我跑去找你们认识的那个人，跟魔鬼一样狠心的高布赛克，拿雷斯多看得了不起的、家传的钻石，他的，我的，一齐卖了。卖了！懂不懂？玛克辛得救了！我完啦。雷斯多全知道了。”

高老头道：“怎么知道的？谁告诉他的？我要这个人的命！”

“昨天他叫我到他屋子去。——他说，阿娜斯大齐……（我一听声音就猜着了），你的钻石在哪儿？——在我屋里啊。——不，他瞅着我说，在这儿，在我的柜子上。——他把手帕蒙着的匣子给我看，说道：你知道从哪儿来的吧？——我双膝跪下……哭着问他要我怎么死。”

“哎哟，你说这个话！”高老头叫起来，“皇天在上，哼！只要我活着，我一定把那个害你们的人，用文火来慢慢地烤，把他割作一片一片，像……”

高老头忽然不响，话到了喉咙说不出了。娜齐又道：

“临了他要我做的事比死还难受。天！但愿做女人的永远不会听到那样的话！”

“我要杀他，”高老头冷冷地说，“可恨他欠我两条命，而他只有一条；以后他又怎么说呢？”高老头望着阿娜斯大齐问。

伯爵夫人停了一忽儿说道：“他瞧着我说：——阿娜斯大齐，我可以一笔勾销，和你照旧同居；我们有孩子。我不打死脱拉伊，因为不一定能打中；用别的方法消灭他又要触犯刑章。在你怀抱里打他吧，教孩子们怎么见人？为了使孩子们，孩子们的父亲，跟我，一个都不伤，我有两个条件。你先回答我：孩子中间有没有我的？——我回答说有。他问：——哪一个？——欧纳斯德，最大的。——好，他说，现在你得起誓，从今以后服从我一件事。（我便起了誓。）多咱我要求你，你就得在你产业的卖契上签字。”

“不能签呀，”高老头叫着，“永远不能签这个字。吓！雷斯多先生，你不能使女人快活，她自己去找；你自己不惭愧，倒反要责罚她？……哼，小心点儿！还有我呢，我要到处去等他。娜齐，你放心。啊，他还舍不得他的后代！好吧，好吧。让我掐死他的儿子，哎哟！天打的！那是我的外孙呀。那么这样吧，我能够看到小娃娃，我把他藏在乡下，你放心，我会照顾他的。我可以逼这个魔鬼投降，对他说：咱们来拼一拼吧！你要儿子，就得还我女儿财产，让她自由。”

“我的父亲！”

“是的，你的父亲！唉，我是一个真正的父亲。这流氓贵族不来伤害我女儿也还罢了。天打的！我不知道我的气多大。我像老虎一样，恨不得把这两个男人吃掉。哦呀！孩子们，你们过的这种生活！我急疯了。我两眼一翻，你们还得了！做父亲的应该和女儿活得一样长久。上帝啊，你把世界弄得多糟！人家还说你圣父有个圣子呢。你正应当保护我们，不要在儿女身上受苦。亲爱的小天使，怎么！直要你们遭了难我才能见到你们么？你们只拿眼泪给我看。嗳，是的，你们是爱我的，我知道。来吧，到这儿来哭诉吧，我的心大得很，什么都容得下。是的，你们尽管戳破我的心，撕做几片，还是一片片父亲的心。我恨不得代你们受苦。啊！你们小时候多么幸福！……”

“只有那个时候是我们的好日子，”但斐纳说，“在阁楼面粉袋上打滚的日子到哪里去了？”

“父亲！事情还没完呢，”阿娜斯大齐咬着老人的耳朵，吓得他直跳起来，“钻石没有卖到十万法郎。玛克辛给告上了。我们还缺一万二。他答应我以后安分守己，不再赌钱。你知道，除了他的爱情，我在世界上一无所有；我又付了那么高的代价，失掉这爱情，我只能死了。我为他牺牲了财产、荣誉、良心、孩子。唉！你至少想想办法，别让玛克辛坐牢，丢脸；我们得支持他，让他在社会上混出一个局面来。现在他不但要负我幸福的责任，还要负不名一文的孩子们的责任。他进了圣·贝拉伊，[2]一切都完啦。”

“我没有这笔钱呀，娜齐。我什么都没有了，没有了！真是世界末日到了。哦呀，世界要坍了，一定的。你们去吧，逃命去吧！呃！我还有银搭扣，六套银的刀叉，我当年第一批买的，最后，我只有一千两百的终身年金……”

“你的长期存款哪儿去了？”

“卖掉了，只留下那笔小数目做生活费。我替但斐纳布置一个屋子，需要一万二。”

“在你家里吗，但斐纳？”特·雷斯多太太问她的妹妹。

高老头说：“问这个干吗！反正一万二已经花掉了。”

伯爵夫人说：“我猜着了。那是为了特·拉斯蒂涅先生。唉！可怜的但斐纳，得了吧。瞧瞧我到了什么田地。”

“亲爱的，特·拉斯蒂涅先生不会教情妇破产。”

“谢谢你，但斐纳，想不到在我危急的关头你会这样；不错，你从来没有爱过我。”

“她爱你的，娜齐，”高老头说，“我们刚才谈到你，她说你真美，她自己不过是漂亮罢了。”

伯爵夫人接着说：“她！那么冷冰冰的，好看？”

“由你说吧，”但斐纳红着脸回答，“可是你怎么对我呢？你不认我妹妹，我希望要走动的人家，你都给我断绝门路，一有机会就教我过不去。我，有没有像你这样把可怜的父亲一千又一千地骗去，把他榨干了，逼他落到这个田地？瞧吧，这是你的成绩，姊姊。我却是尽可能地来看父亲，并没把他撵出门外，等到要用着他的时候再来舐他的手。他为我花掉一万二，事先我完全不知道。我没有乱花钱，你是知道的。并且即使爸爸送东西给我，我从来没有向他要过。”

“你比我幸福，特·玛赛先生有钱，你肚里明白。你老是像黄金一样吝啬。再会吧，我没有姊妹，也没有……”

高老头喝道：“别说了，娜齐！”

但斐纳回答娜齐：“只有像你这样的姊妹才会跟着别人造我谣言，你这种话已经没有人相信了。你是野兽。”

“孩子们，孩子们，别说了，要不我死在你们前面了。”

特·纽沁根太太接着说：“得啦，娜齐，我原谅你，你倒了霉。可是我不像你这么做人。你对我说这种话，正当我想拿出勇气帮助你的时候，甚至想走进丈夫的屋子求他，那是我从来不肯做的，哪怕为了我自己或者为了……这个总该对得起你九年以来对我的阴损吧？”

父亲说：“孩子们，我的孩子们，你们拥抱呀！你们是一对好天使呀！”

“不，不，你松手，”伯爵夫人挣脱父亲的手臂，不让他拥抱，“她对我比我丈夫还狠心。大家还要说她大贤大德呢！”

特·纽沁根太太回答：“哼，我宁可人家说我欠特·玛赛先生的钱，不愿意承认特·脱拉伊先生花了我二十多万。”

伯爵夫人向她走近一步，叫道：“但斐纳！”

男爵夫人冷冷地回答：“你诬蔑我，我只对你说老实话。”

“但斐纳！你是一个……”

高老头扑上去拉住娜齐，把手掩着她的嘴。

娜齐道：“哎唷！父亲，你今天碰过了什么东西？”

“哟，是的，我忘了，”可怜的父亲把手在裤子上抹了一阵，“我不知道你们会来，我正要搬家。”

他很高兴受这一下抱怨，把女儿的怒气转移到自己身上。他坐下说：

“唉！你们撕破了我的心。我要死了，孩子们！脑子里好像有团火在烧。你们该和和气气，相亲相爱。你们要我命了。但斐纳，娜齐，得了吧，你们俩都有是都有不是。喂，但但尔，”他含着一泡眼泪望着男爵夫人，“她要一万两千法郎，咱们来张罗吧。你们别这样地瞪眼呀。”

他跪在但斐纳面前，凑着她耳朵说：

“让我高兴一下，你向她赔个不是吧，她比你更倒霉是不是？”

父亲的表情痛苦得像疯子和野人，但斐纳吓坏了，说道：

“可怜的娜齐，是我错了，来，拥抱我吧……”

高老头道：“啊！这样我心里才好过一些。可是哪儿去找一万两千法郎呢？也许我可以代替人家服兵役。”

“啊！父亲！不能，不能。”两个女儿围着他喊。

但斐纳说：“你这种念头只有上帝报答你，我们粉身碎骨也补报不了！不是么，娜齐？”

“再说，可怜的父亲，即使代替人家服兵役也不过杯水车薪，无济于事。”娜齐回答。

老人绝望之极，叫道：“那么咱们卖命也不成吗？只要有人救你，娜齐，我肯为他拼命，为他杀人放火。我愿意像伏脱冷一样进苦役监！我……”他忽然停住，仿佛被雷劈了一样。他扯着头发又道：“什么都光了！我要知道到哪儿去偷就好啦。不过要寻到一个能偷的地方也不容易。抢银行吧，又要人手又要时间。唉，我应该死了，只有死了。不中用了，再不能说是父亲了！不能了。她来向我要，她有急用！而我，该死的东西，竟然分文没有。啊！你把钱存了终身年金，你这老浑蛋，你忘了女儿吗？难道你不爱她们了吗？死吧，像野狗一样地死吧！对啦，我比狗还不如，一条狗也不至于干出这种事来！哎哟！我的脑袋烧起来啦。”

“噢！爸爸，使不得，使不得。”姊妹俩拦着他，不让他把脑袋往墙上撞。

他号啕大哭。欧也纳吓坏了，抓起当初给伏脱冷的借据，上面的印花本来超过原来借款的数目；他改了数字，缮成一张一万二的借据，写上高里奥的抬头，拿着走过去。

“你的钱来了，太太，”他把票据递给她，“我正在睡觉，被你们的谈话惊醒了，我才知道我欠着高里奥先生这笔钱。这儿是张票据，你可以拿去周转，我到期准定还清。”

伯爵夫人拿了票据，一动不动；她脸色发白，浑身哆嗦，气愤到极点，叫道：

“但斐纳，我什么都能原谅你，上帝可以做证！可是这一手哪！吓，你明知道他先生在屋里！你竟这样卑鄙，借他来报仇，让我把自己的秘密、生活、孩子的底细、我的耻辱、名誉，统统交在他手里！去吧，我不认得你这个人，我恨你，我要好好地收拾你……”她气得说不上话，喉咙都干了。

“嗳，他是我的儿子啊，是咱们大家的孩子，是你的兄弟，你的救星啊，”高老头叫着，“来拥抱他，娜齐！瞧，我拥抱他呢。”他说着拼命抱着欧也纳。“噢！我的孩子！我不但要做你的父亲，还要代替你所有的家属。我恨不得变作上帝，把世界丢在你脚下。来，娜齐，来亲他！他不是个凡人，是个天使，真正的天使。”

但斐纳说：“别理她，父亲，她疯了。”

特·雷斯多太太说：“疯了！疯了！你呢？”

“孩子们，你们这样下去，我要死了。”老人说着，像中了一颗子弹似的往床上倒下。“她们逼死我了！”他对自己说。

欧也纳被这场剧烈的吵架弄得失魂落魄，一动不动愣在那里。但斐纳急急忙忙替父亲解开背心。娜齐毫不在意，她的声音、目光、姿势，都带着探问的意味，叫了声欧也纳：

“先生——”

他不等她问下去就回答：“太太，我一定付清，决不声张。”

老人晕过去了，但斐纳叫道：

“娜齐！你把父亲逼死了！”

娜齐却是往外跑了。

“我原谅她，”老人睁开眼来说，“她的处境太可怕了，头脑再冷静的人也受不住。你安慰安慰娜齐吧，对她好好的，你得答应我，答应你快死的父亲。”他紧紧握着但斐纳的手说。

但斐纳大吃一惊，说道：“你怎么啦？”

父亲说：“没有什么，没有什么。就会好的。觉得有些东西压在我脑门上，大概是头痛。可怜的娜齐，将来怎么办呢？”

这时伯爵夫人回进屋子，跪倒在父亲脚下，叫道：

“原谅我吧！”

“唉，”高老头回答，“你现在叫我更难受了。”

伯爵夫人含着泪招呼拉斯蒂涅：“先生，我一时急昏了头，冤枉了人，你对我真像兄弟一样么？”她向他伸出手来。

“娜齐，我的小娜齐，把一切都忘了吧。”但斐纳抱着她叫。

“我不会忘掉的，我！”

高老头嚷道：“你们都是天使，你们使我重见光明，你们的声音使我活过来了。你们再拥抱一下吧。嗳，娜齐，这张借据能救了你吗？”

“但愿如此。喂，爸爸，你能不能给个背书？”

“对啦，我真该死，忘了签字！我刚才不舒服，娜齐，别恨我啊。你事情完了，马上派人来说一声。不，还是我自己来吧。哦，不！我不能来，我不能看见你丈夫，我会当场打死他的。他休想抢你的财产，还有我呢。快去吧，孩子，想法教玛克辛安分些。”

欧也纳看着呆住了。

特·纽沁根太太说：“可怜的娜齐一向暴躁，她心是好的。”

“她是为了借票的背书回来的。”欧也纳凑在但斐纳的耳边说。

“真的吗？”

“但愿不是，你可不能不防她一着。”他抬起眼睛，仿佛把不敢明说的话告诉了上帝。

“是的，她专门装腔，可怜父亲就相信她那一套。”

“你觉得怎么啦？”拉斯蒂涅问老人。

“我想睡觉。”他回答。

欧也纳帮着高里奥睡下。老人抓着但斐纳的手睡熟的时候，她预备走了，对欧也纳说：

“今晚在意大利剧院等你。到时你告诉我父亲的情形。明儿你得搬家了，先生。让我瞧瞧你的屋子吧。”她一进去便叫起来：“哟！要命！你比父亲住得还要坏。欧也纳，你心地太好了。我更要爱你。可是孩子，倘使你想挣一份家业，就不能把一万两千法郎随便往窗外扔。特·脱拉伊先生是个赌棍，姊姊不愿意看清这一点。一万二！他会到输一座金山或者赢一座金山的地方去张罗的。”

他们听见哼了一声，便回到高里奥屋里。他似乎睡熟了；两个情人走近去，听见他说了声：

“她们在受罪啊！”

不管他是睡着还是醒着，说那句话的口气大大地感动了女儿，她走到破床前面亲了亲他的额角。他睁开眼来说：

“哦！是但斐纳！”

“嗳，你觉得怎么样？”她问。

“还好，你别担心，我就要上街的。得啦，得啦，孩子们，你们尽管去快活吧。”

欧也纳送但斐纳回家，因为不放心高里奥，不肯陪她吃饭。他回到伏盖公寓，看见高老头起来了，正预备吃饭。皮安训挑了个好仔细打量面条商的座位，看他嗅着面包辨别面粉的模样，发觉他的行动已经身不由主，便做了个凄惨的姿势。

“坐到我这边来，实习医师。”欧也纳招呼他。

皮安训很乐意搬个位置，可以和老头儿离得更近。

“他什么病呀？”欧也纳问。

“除非我看错，他完啦！他身上有些出奇的变化，恐怕马上要脑溢血了。下半个脸还好，上半部的线条统统往脑门那边吊上去了。那古怪的眼神也显得血浆已经进了脑子。你瞧他眼睛不是像布满无数的微尘吗？明儿我可以看得更清楚些。”

“还有救吗？”

“没有救了。也许可以拖几天，倘使能把反应限制在身体的末梢，譬如说，限制在大腿部分。明天晚上要是病象不停止，可怜虫就完啦。他怎么发病的，你知道没有？一定精神上受了剧烈的打击。”

“是的。”欧也纳说着，想起两个女儿接二连三地打击父亲的心。

“至少但斐纳是孝顺的！”他私下想。

晚上在意大利剧院，他说话很小心，唯恐特·纽沁根太太惊慌。

“你不用急，”她听了开头几句就回答，“父亲身体很强壮。不过今儿早上我们给他受了些刺激。我们的财产成了问题，你可知道这件倒霉事儿多么严重？要不是你的爱情使我感觉麻木，我竟活不下去了。爱情给了我生活的乐趣，现在我只怕失掉爱情。除此以外，我觉得一切都无所谓，世界上我什么都不爱了。你是我的一切。倘若我觉得有了钱快乐，那也是为了更能讨你喜欢。说句不怕害臊的话，我的爱情胜过我的孝心。我不知道为什么。我整个生命都在你身上。父亲给了我一颗心，可是有了你，它才会跳。全世界责备我，我也不管！你是没有权利恨我的，我为了不可抵抗的感情犯的罪，只要你能替我补赎就行了。你把我当作没有良心的女儿吗？噢，不是的。怎么能不爱一个像我们那样的好爸爸呢？可是我们可叹的婚姻的必然的后果，我能瞒着他吗？干吗他当初不拦阻我们？不是应该由他来替我们着想吗？今天我才知道他和我们一样痛苦；可是有什么办法？安慰他吗？安慰不了什么。咬紧牙齿忍耐吗？那比我们的责备和诉苦使他更难受。人生有些局面，简直样样都是辛酸。”

真正的感情表现得这么坦白，欧也纳听着很感动，一声不出。固然巴黎妇女往往虚伪，非常虚荣，只顾自己，又轻浮又冷酷；可是一朝真正动了心，能比别的女子为爱情牺牲更多的感情，能摆脱一切的狭窄卑鄙，变得伟大，达到高超的境界。并且，等到有一股特别强烈的感情把女人跟天性（例如父母与子女的感情）隔离了，有了距离之后，她批判天性的时候所表现的那种深刻和正确，也教欧也纳暗暗吃惊。特·纽沁根太太看见欧也纳不声不响，觉得心中不快，问道：

“你想什么呀？”

“我在体味你的话，我一向以为你爱我不及我爱你呢。”

她微微一笑，竭力遮掩心中的快乐，免得谈话越出体统。年轻而真诚的爱自有一些动人心魄的辞令，她从来没有听见过。再说几句，她就要忍不住了。

她改变话题，说道：“欧也纳，难道你不知道那个新闻吗？明天，全巴黎都要到特·鲍赛昂太太家，洛希斐特同特·阿瞿达侯爵约好，一点消息不让走漏；王上明儿要批准他们的婚约，你可怜的表姊还蒙在鼓里。她不能取消舞会，可是侯爵不会到场了。到处都在谈这件事。”

“大家取笑一个人受辱，暗地里却就在促成这种事！你不知道特·鲍赛昂太太要为之气死吗？”

但斐纳笑道：“不会的，你不知道这一类妇女。可是全巴黎都要到她家里去，我也要去——托你的福！”

“巴黎有的是谣言，说不定又是什么捕风捉影的事。”

“咱们明天便知分晓。”

欧也纳没有回伏盖公寓。他没有那个决心不享受一下他的新居。隔天他半夜一点钟离开但斐纳，今儿是但斐纳在清早两点左右离开他回家。第二天他起得很晚，中午等特·纽沁根太太来一块儿用餐。青年人都是只顾自己快活的，欧也纳差不多忘了高老头。在新屋里把精雅绝伦的东西一件一件使用过来，真是其乐无穷。再加特·纽沁根太太在场，更抬高了每样东西的价值。四点光景，两个情人记起了高老头，想到他有心搬到这儿来享福。欧也纳认为倘若老人病了，应当赶紧接过来。他离开但斐纳奔回伏盖家。高里奥和皮安训两人都不在饭桌上。

“啊，喂，”画家招呼他，“高老头病倒了，皮安训在楼上看护。老头儿今天接见了他一个女儿，特·雷斯多喇嘛伯爵夫人，以后他出去了一趟，加重了病。看来咱们要损失一件美丽的古董了。”

拉斯蒂涅冲上楼梯。

“喂，欧也纳先生！”

“欧也纳先生！太太请你。”西尔维叫。

“先生，”寡妇说，“高里奥先生和你应该是二月十五搬出的，现在已经过期三天，今儿是十八了，你们得再付一个月。要是你肯担保高老头，只请你说一声就行。”

“干吗？你不相信他吗？”

“相信！倘使老头儿昏迷了，死了，他的女儿们连一个子儿都不会给我的。他的破烂东西统共不值十法郎。今儿早上他把最后的餐具也卖掉了，不知为什么。他脸色像青年人一样。上帝原谅我，我只道他搽着胭脂，返老还童了呢。”

“一切由我负责。”欧也纳说着心慌得厉害，唯恐出了乱子。

他奔进高老头的屋子。老人躺在床上，皮安训坐在旁边。

“你好，老丈。”

老人对他温柔地笑了笑，两只玻璃珠子般的眼睛望着他，问：

“她怎么样？”

“很好，你呢？”

“不坏。”

“别让他劳神。”皮安训把欧也纳拉到屋子的一角嘱咐他。

“怎么啦？”欧也纳问。

“除非奇迹才有办法。脑溢血已经发作。现在贴着芥子膏药；幸而他还有感觉，药性已经起了作用。”

“能不能把他搬个地方？”

“不行。得留在这儿，不能有一点儿动作和精神上的刺激……”

欧也纳说：“皮安训，咱们俩来照顾他吧。”

“我已经请医院的主任医师来过。”

“结果呢？”

“要明儿晚上知道。他答应办完了公就来。不幸这倒霉蛋今儿早上胡闹了一次，他不肯说为什么。他脾气僵得像匹驴。我跟他说话，他装不听见，装睡，给我一个不理不答；倘使睁着眼睛，就一味地哼哼。他早上出去了，在城里乱跑，不知到了哪儿去。他把值钱的东西统统拿走了，做了些该死的交易，弄得精疲力尽！他女儿之中有一个来过这儿。”

“伯爵夫人吗？是不是大个子，深色头发，眼睛很精神很好看，身腰软软的，一双脚很有样的那个？”

“是的。”

拉斯蒂涅道：“让我来陪他一会。我盘问他，他会告诉我的。”

“我趁这时候去吃饭。千万别让他太兴奋；咱们还有一线希望呢。”

“你放心。”

高老头等皮安训走了，对欧也纳说：“明儿她们好痛痛快快地乐一下了。她们要参加一个盛大的跳舞会。”

“老丈，你今儿早上干了什么，累成这个样子躺在床上？”

“没有干什么。”

“阿娜斯大齐来过了吗？”拉斯蒂涅问。

“是的。”高老头回答。

“哎！别瞒我啦。她又问你要什么？”

“唉！”他迸足了力气说，“她很苦呀，我的孩子！自从出了钻石的事，她一个子儿都没有了。她为那个跳舞会定做了一件金线铺绣衣衫，好看到极点。不料那下流的女裁缝不肯赊账，结果老妈子垫了一千法郎定洋。可怜娜齐落到这步田地！我的心都碎了。老妈子看见雷斯多不相信娜齐，怕垫的钱没有着落，串通了裁缝，要等一千法郎还清才肯送衣服来。舞会便是明天，衣衫已经做好，娜齐急得没有法了。她想借我的餐具去抵押。雷斯多非要她上那个舞会去，教全巴黎瞧瞧那些钻石，外边说是她卖掉了。你想她能对那个恶鬼说：我欠着一千法郎，替我付一付吧。当然不能。我明白这个道理。但斐纳明儿要打扮得天仙似的，娜齐当然不能比不上妹妹。并且她哭得泪人儿似的，可怜的孩子！昨天我拿不出一万两千法郎，已经惭愧死了，我要拼这条苦命来补救。过去我什么都咬着牙齿忍受，但这一回没有钱，真是撕破了我的心。吓！我马上打定主意，把我的钱重新调度一下，拼凑一下；银搭扣和餐具卖了六百法郎，我的终身年金向高布赛克押了四百法郎，一年为期。也行！我光吃面包就得了！年轻的时候我就是这样的，现在也还可以。至少我的娜齐能快快活活地消磨一晚啦，能花枝招展地去出风头啦。一千法郎钞票已经放在我床头。想着头底下藏着娜齐喜欢的东西，我心里就暖和。现在她可以撵走可恶的维多阿了，哼！用人不相信主人，还像话！明儿我就好啦，娜齐十点钟要来的。我不愿意她们以为我害了病。那她们要不去跳舞，来服侍我了。娜齐会拥抱我像拥抱她的孩子，她跟我亲热一下，我的病就没有啦。再说，在药铺子里我不是也能花掉上千法郎吗？我宁可给包医百病的娜齐的。至少我还能使她在苦难中得到点安慰，我存了终身年金的过失也能补救一下。她掉在窟窿里，我没有能力救她出来。哦！我要再去做买卖，上奥特赛去买谷子。那边的麦子比这儿贱三倍。麦子进口是禁止的；可是定法律的先生们并没禁止用麦子做的东西进口哪，吓，吓！今儿早上我想出来了！做淀粉买卖还有很大的赚头。”

“他疯了。”欧也纳望着老人想。

“得啦，你歇歇吧，别说话……”

皮安训上楼，欧也纳下去吃饭。接着两人轮流守夜，一个念医书，一个写信给母亲姊妹。

第二天，病人的征象，据皮安训说，略有转机；可是需要不断治疗，那也唯有两个大学生才能胜任。老人骨瘦如柴的身上除了安放许多水蛭以外，又要用水罨，又要用热水洗脚，种种的治疗，不是两个热心而强壮的青年人休想对付得了。特·雷斯多太太没有来，派了当差来拿钱。

“我以为她会亲自来的呢。也好，免得她看见我病了操心。”高老头说。女儿不来，他倒好像很高兴似的。

晚上七点，丹兰士送来一封但斐纳的信。


“你在干什么呀，朋友？才相爱，难道就对我冷淡了吗？在肝胆相照的那些心腹话中，你表现的心灵太美了，我相信你是永久忠实的，感情的微妙，你了解太深刻了，正如你听摩才的祷告[3]时说的：对某些人，这不过是音符，对另外一些人是无穷尽的音乐！别忘了我今晚等你一同赴特·鲍赛昂夫人的舞会。特·阿瞿达先生的婚约，今天早上在宫中签了，可怜子爵夫人到两点才知道。全巴黎的妇女都要拥到她家里去，好似群众挤到葛兰佛广场去看执行死刑。你想，去瞧这位太太能否掩藏她的痛苦，能否视死如归，不是太惨了吗？朋友，倘使我从前去过她的家，今天我决计不去了；但她今后一定不再招待宾客，我过去所有的努力不是白费了吗？我的情形和别人不同，况且我也是为你去的。我等你。要是两小时内你还不在我身边，我不知道是否能原谅你。”



拉斯蒂涅拿起笔来回答：


“我等医生来，要知道你父亲还能活不能活。他快死了。我会把医生的判决通知你，恐怕竟是死刑。你能不能赴舞会，到时你斟酌吧。请接受我无限的温情。”



八点半，医生来了，认为虽然没有什么希望，也不至于马上就死。他说还有好几次反复，才决定老人的生命和神志。

“他还是快一点死的好。”这是医生的最后一句话。

欧也纳把高老头交托给皮安训，向特·纽沁根太太报告凶讯去了；他家庭观念还很重，觉得一切娱乐这时都应该停止。

高老头好似迷迷糊糊地睡着了，在拉斯蒂涅出去的时候忽然坐起来叫着：“告诉她，叫她尽管去玩儿。”

拉斯蒂涅愁眉苦脸地跑到但斐纳前面。她头也梳好了，鞋也穿好了，只等套上跳舞衣衫。可是最后的修整，像画家收拾作品的最后几笔，比用颜色打底子更费功夫。

“嗯，怎么，你还没有换衣服？”她问。

“可是太太，你的父亲……”

“又是我的父亲，”她截住了他的话，“应该怎么对待父亲，不用你来告诉我。我认识他这么多年了。欧也纳，甭说啦。你先穿扮了，我才听你的话。丹兰士在你家里一切都准备好了；我的车套好在那儿，你坐着去，坐着回来。到跳舞会去的路上，再谈父亲的事。我们非要早点儿动身不可，如果困在车马阵里，包管十一点才能进门。”

“太太！”

“去吧！甭说啦。”她说着奔进内客室去拿项链。

“嗳，去啊，欧也纳先生，你要惹太太生气了。”丹兰士一边说一边推他走。他可是被这个风雅的忤逆女儿吓呆了。

他一路穿衣一路想着最可怕最丧气的念头。他觉得社会好比一个大泥淖，一脚踩了进去，就陷到脖子。他想：

“他们连犯罪也是没有骨气没有血性的！伏脱冷伟大多哩。”

他看到人生的三个面目：服从，斗争，反抗；家庭，社会，伏脱冷。他决不定挑哪条路。服从吗？受不了；反抗吗？做不到；斗争吗？没有把握。他又想到自己的家，恬静的生活，纯洁的感情，过去在疼爱他的人中间消磨的日子。那些亲爱的人按部就班照着日常生活的规律，在家庭中找到一种圆满的、持续不断的、没有苦闷的幸福。他虽有这些高尚的念头，可没有勇气向但斐纳说出他纯洁的信仰，不敢利用爱情强迫她走上道德的路。他才开始受到的教育已经见效，为了爱情，他已经自私了。他凭着他的聪明，识透了但斐纳的心，觉得她为了参加跳舞会，不怕踩着父亲的身体走过去；而他既没有力量开导她，也没有勇气得罪她，更没有骨气离开她。

“在这个情形之下使她理屈，她永远不会原谅我的。”他想。

然后他又推敲医生的话，觉得高老头也许并不像他想象的危险；总之他找出许多为凶手着想的理由，替但斐纳开脱。先是她不知道父亲的病情。即使她去看他，老人自己也要逼她回去参加跳舞会的。呆板的礼教只知道死抓公式，责备那些显而易见的过失；其实家庭中各人的性格，利害观念，当时的情势，都千变万化，可能造成许多特殊情形，宽恕那些表面上的罪过。欧也纳要骗自己，预备为了情妇而抹杀良心。两天以来，他的生活大起变化。女人搅乱了他的心，压倒了家庭，一切都为着女人牺牲了。拉斯蒂涅和但斐纳是在干柴烈火，使他们极尽绸缪的情形之下相遇的。欢情不但没有消灭情欲，反而把充分培养的情欲挑拨得更旺。欧也纳占有了这个女人，才发觉过去对她不过是肉的追求，直到幸福到手的第二天方始对她有爱情。也许爱情只是对欢娱所表示的感激。她下流也罢，高尚也罢，他反正爱极了这个女人，为了他给她的快乐，也为了他得到的快乐，而但斐纳的爱拉斯蒂涅，也像坦塔罗斯爱一个给他充饥疗渴的天使一样。[4]

欧也纳穿了跳舞服装回去，特·纽沁根太太问道：

“现在你说吧，父亲怎么啦？”

“不行哪。你要真爱我，咱们马上去看他。”

她说：“好吧，等跳舞回来。我的好欧也纳，乖乖的，别教训我啦，来吧。”

他们动身了。车子走了一程，欧也纳一声不出。

“你怎么啦？”她问。

“我听见你父亲痰都涌上来了。”他带着气恼的口吻回答。

接着他用青年人的慷慨激昂的辞令，说出特·雷斯多太太如何为了虚荣心下毒手，父亲如何为了爱她而闹出这场危险的病，娜齐的金线舞衫付出了如何可怕的代价。但斐纳听着哭了。

“我要难看了。”

这么一想，她眼泪干了，接着说：

“我要去服侍父亲，守在他床头。”

拉斯蒂涅道：“啊！这样我才称心哩。”

鲍赛昂府四周被五百多辆车上的灯照得通明雪亮。大门两旁各各站着一个气吁吁的警察。这个名门贵妇栽了斤斗，无数上流社会的人都要来瞧她一瞧。特·纽沁根太太和拉斯蒂涅到的时候，楼下一排大厅早已黑压压地挤满了人。当年大公主和特·洛尚公爵的婚约被路易十四否决以后，宫廷里全班人马曾经拥到公主府里；从此还没有一件情场失意的悲剧像特·鲍赛昂夫人的那样轰动过。那位天潢贵胄，蒲高涅王室的最后一个女儿，[5]可并没有被痛苦压倒。当初她为了点缀她爱情的胜利，曾经敷衍这一个虚荣浅薄的社会；现在到了最后一刻，她依旧高高在上，控制这个社会。每间客厅里都是巴黎最美的妇女，个个盛装艳服，堆着笑脸。宫廷中最显要的人物，各国的大使公使，部长，名流，挂满了十字勋章，系着五光十色的绶带，争先恐后拥在子爵夫人周围。乐队送出一句又一句的音乐，在金碧辉煌的天顶下缭绕；可是在女后心目中，这个地方已经变成一片荒凉。鲍赛昂太太站在第一间客厅的门口，迎接那些自称为她的朋友的人。全身穿着白衣服，头上简简单单地盘着发辫，没有一点装饰，她安闲静穆，既没有痛苦，也没有高傲，也没有假装的快乐。没有一个人能看透她的心思。几乎像一座尼沃贝[6]的石像。她对几个熟朋友的笑容有时带点儿嘲弄的意味；但是在众人眼里，她始终和平常一样，同她被幸福的光辉照耀的时候一样。这个态度叫一般最麻木的人也看了佩服，犹如古时的罗马青年对一个含笑而死的斗兽士喝彩。上流社会似乎特意装点得花团锦簇，来跟它的一个母后告别。

她和拉斯蒂涅说：“我只怕你不来呢。”

拉斯蒂涅觉得这句话有点埋怨的意思，声音很激动地回答：“太太，我是预备最后一个走的。”

“好，”她握着他的手说，“这儿我能够信托的大概只有你一个人。朋友，对一个女人能永久爱下去，就该爱下去。别随便丢了她。”

她挽着拉斯蒂涅的手臂走进一间打牌的客室，带他坐在一张长沙发上，说道：

“请你替我上侯爵那儿送封信去。我叫当差带路。我向他要还我的书信，希望他全部交给你。拿到之后你上楼到卧室去等我。他们会通知我的。”

她的好朋友特·朗日公爵夫人也来了，她站起身来迎接。拉斯蒂涅出发上洛希斐特公馆，据说侯爵今晚就在那边。他果然找到了阿瞿达，跟他一同回去，侯爵拿出一个匣子，说道：

“统统在这儿了。”

他好像要对欧也纳说话，也许想打听跳舞会和子爵夫人的情形，也许想透露他已经对婚姻失望——以后他也的确失望；不料他眼中忽然亮起一道骄傲的光，拿出可叹的勇气来，把他最高尚的感情压了下去。

“亲爱的欧也纳，别跟她提到我。”

他紧紧握了握拉斯蒂涅的手，又恳切又伤感，意思催他快走。欧也纳回到鲍赛昂府，给带进子爵夫人的卧房，房内是准备旅行的排场。他坐在壁炉旁边，望着那杉木匣子非常伤心。在他心中，特·鲍赛昂太太的身份不下于《伊里亚特》史诗中的女神。

“啊！朋友。”子爵夫人进来把手放在拉斯蒂涅肩上。

她流着泪，仰着眼睛，一只手发抖，一只手举着。她突然把匣子放在火上，看它烧起来。

“他们都在跳舞！他们都准时而到，偏偏死神不肯就来。——嘘！朋友。”拉斯蒂涅想开口，被她拦住了。她说：“我永远不再见巴黎，不再见人了。清早五点，我就动身，到诺曼底乡下去躲起来。从下午三点起，我忙着种种准备，签署文书，料理银钱杂务；我没有一个人能派到……”

她停住了。

“我知道他一定在……”

她难过得不行了，又停住了。这时一切都是痛苦，有些字眼简直说不出口。

“我早打算请你今晚帮我最后一次忙。我想送你一件纪念品。我时常想到你，觉得你心地好，高尚，年轻，诚实，那些品质在这个社会里是少有的。希望你有时也想到我。”她向四下里瞧了一下，“哦，有了，这是我放手套的匣子。每次我上舞会或戏院之前拿手套的时候，总觉得自己很美，因为那时我是幸福的；我每次碰到这匣子，总对它有点儿温情，它多少有我的一点儿气息，有当年的整个鲍赛昂夫人在内。你收下吧。我等会叫人送到阿多阿街去。特·纽沁根太太今晚漂亮得很，你得好好地爱她。朋友，我们尽管从此分别了，你可以相信我远远地祝福你。你对我多好。我们下楼吧，我不愿意人家以为我在哭。以后的日子长呢，一个人的时候，谁也不会来追究我的眼泪了。让我再瞧一瞧这间屋子。”

说到这儿她停住了。她把手遮着眼睛，抹了一下，用冷水浸过，然后挽着大学生的手臂，说道：“走吧！”

特·鲍赛昂太太，以这样英勇的精神忍受痛苦，拉斯蒂涅看了感情激动到极点。回到舞会，他同特·鲍赛昂太太在场子里绕了一转。这位恳切的太太借此表示她最后一番心意。

不久他看见了两姊妹，特·雷斯多太太和特·纽沁根太太。伯爵夫人戴着全部钻石，气概非凡，可是那些钻石决不会使她好受，而且也是最后一次穿戴了。尽管爱情强烈，态度骄傲，她到底受不住丈夫的目光。这种场面更增加拉斯蒂涅的伤感。在姊妹俩的钻石下面，他看到高老头躺的破床。子爵夫人误会了他的怏怏不乐的表情，抽回手臂，说道：“去吧！我不愿意你为我牺牲快乐。”

欧也纳不久被但斐纳邀了去。她露了头角，好不得意。她一心要讨这个社会喜欢，既然如愿以偿，也就急于拿她的成功献在大学生脚下。

“你觉得娜齐怎么样？”她问。

“她吗，”欧也纳回答，“她预支了她父亲的性命。”

清早四点，客厅的人渐渐稀少。不久音乐也停止了。大客厅中只剩特·朗日公爵夫人和拉斯蒂涅。特·鲍赛昂先生要去睡觉了，子爵夫人和他作别，他再三说：

“亲爱的，何必隐居呢，在你这个年纪！还是同我们一块儿住下吧。”

告别完了，她走到大客厅，以为只有大学生在那儿；一看见公爵夫人，不由得叫了一声。

“我猜到你的意思，格拉拉，”特·朗日太太说，“你要一去不回地走了；你未走之前，我有番话要跟你说，我们之间不能有一点儿误会。”

特·朗日太太挽着特·鲍赛昂太太的手臂走到隔壁的客厅里，含着泪望着她，把她抱着，亲她的面颊，说道：

“亲爱的，我不愿意跟你冷冰冰地分手，我良心上受不了。你可以相信我，像相信你自己一样。你今晚很伟大，我自问还配得上你，还要向你证明这一点。过去我有些对不起你的地方，我没有始终如一，亲爱的，请你原谅。一切使你伤心的行为，我都向你道歉；我愿意收回我说过的话。患难成知己，我不知道我们俩哪一个更痛苦。特·蒙脱里伏先生今晚没有上这儿来，你明白没有？格拉拉，到过这次舞会的人永远忘不了你。我吗，我在做最后的努力；万一失败，就进修道院！你又上哪儿呢，你？”

“上诺曼底，躲到古撒尔乡下去，去爱，去祈祷，直到上帝把我召回为止。”

子爵夫人想起欧也纳等着，便招呼他：

“拉斯蒂涅先生，你来吧。”

大学生弯着身子握了表姊的手亲吻。

特·鲍赛昂太太说：“安多纳德，告辞了！但愿你幸福。”她转身对着大学生说：“至于你，你已经幸福了，你年轻，还能有信仰。没想到我离开这个社会的时候，像那般幸运的死者，周围还有些虔诚的真诚的心！”

拉斯蒂涅目送特·鲍赛昂夫人坐上旅行的轿车，看她泪眼晶莹同他做了最后一次告别。由此可见社会上地位最高的人，并不像那般趋奉群众的人说的，能逃出感情的规律而没有伤心痛苦的事。五点光景，欧也纳冒着又冷又潮湿的天气走回伏盖公寓。他的教育受完了。

拉斯蒂涅走进邻居的屋子，皮安训和他说：“可怜的高老头没有救了。”

欧也纳把睡熟的老人望了一眼，回答说：“朋友，既然你能克制欲望，就走你平凡的路吧。我入了地狱，而且得留在地狱。不管人家把上流社会说得怎么坏，你相信就是！没有一个讽刺作家能写尽隐藏在金银珠宝底下的丑恶。”

父亲的死


第二天下午两点左右，皮安训要出去，叫醒拉斯蒂涅，接他的班。高老头的病势上半天又加重许多。

“老头儿活不到两天了，也许还活不到六小时，”医学生道，“可是他的病，咱们不能置之不理。还得给他一些费钱的治疗。咱们替他当看护是不成问题，我可没有钱。他的衣袋，柜子，我都翻遍了，全是空的。他神志清楚的时候我问过他，他说连一个子儿都没有了。你身上有多少，你？”

“还剩二十法郎，我可以去赌，会赢的。”

“输了怎办？”

“问他的女婿女儿去要。”

皮安训道：“他们不给又怎办？眼前最急的还不是钱，而是要在他身上贴滚热的芥子膏药，从脚底直到大腿的半中间。他要叫起来，那还有希望。你知道怎么做的。再说，克利斯朵夫可以帮你忙。我到药剂师那儿去作个保，赊欠药账。可惜不能送他进我们的医院，招呼得好一些。来，让我告诉你怎么办；我不回来，你不能离开他。”

他们走进老人的屋子，欧也纳看到他的脸变得没有血色，没有生气，扭作一团，不由得大吃一惊。

“喂，老丈，怎么样？”他靠着破床弯下身去问。

高里奥眨巴着黯淡的眼睛，仔细瞧了瞧欧也纳，认不得他。大学生受不住了，眼泪直涌出来。

“皮安训，窗上可要挂个帘子？”

“不用。气候的变化对他已经不生影响。他要有冷热的知觉倒好了。可是咱们还得生个火，好煮药茶，还能作好些旁的用处。等会我叫人送些柴草来对付一下，慢慢再张罗木柴。昨天一昼夜，我把你的柴跟老头儿的泥炭都烧完了。屋子潮得厉害，墙壁都在淌水，还没完全烘燥呢。克利斯朵夫把屋子打扫过了，简直像马房，臭得要命，我烧了些松子。”

拉斯蒂涅叫道：“我的天！想想他的女儿哪！”

“他要喝水的话，给他这个，”医学生指着一把大白壶，“倘若他哼哼唧唧地叫苦，肚子又热又硬，你就叫克利斯朵夫帮着给他来一下……你知道的。万一他兴奋起来说许多话，有点儿精神错乱，由他去好了。那倒不是坏现象，可是你得叫克利斯朵夫上医院来。我们的医生，我的同事，或是我，我们会来给他做一次灸。今儿早上你睡觉的时候，我们会诊过一次，到的有迦尔博士的一个学生，圣父医院的主任医师跟我们的主任医师。他们认为颇有些奇特的症候，必须注意病势的进展，可以弄清科学上的几个要点。有一位说，血浆的压力要是特别加在某个器官上，可能发生一些特殊的现象。所以老头儿一说话，你就得留心听，看是哪一类的思想，是记忆方面的，智力方面的，还是判断方面的；看他注意物质的事还是情感的事；是否计算，是否回想过去；总之你想法给我们一个准确的报告。病势可能急转直下，他会像现在这样人事不知地死去。这一类的病怪得很。倘若在这个地方爆发，”皮安训指了指病人的后脑，“说不定有些出奇出怪的病状：头脑某几个部分会恢复机能，一下子死不了。血浆能从脑里回出来，至于再走什么路，只有解剖尸体才能知道。残废院内有个痴呆的老人，充血跟着脊椎骨走；人痛苦得不得了，可是活在那儿。”

高老头忽然认出了欧也纳，说道：

“她们玩得痛快吗？”

“哦！他只想着他的女儿，”皮安训道，“昨夜他和我说了上百次：她们在跳舞呢！她的跳舞衣衫有了。——他叫她们的名字。那声音把我听得哭了，真是要命！他叫：但斐纳！我的小但斐纳！娜齐！真的！简直叫你止不住眼泪。”

“但斐纳，”老人接口说，“她在这儿，是不是？我知道的。”

他眼睛忽然骨碌碌地乱转，瞪着墙壁和房门。

“我下去叫西尔维预备芥子膏药，”皮安训说，“这是替他上药的好机会。”

拉斯蒂涅独自陪着老人，坐在床脚下，定睛瞧着这副嘴脸，觉得又害怕又难过。

“特·鲍赛昂太太逃到乡下去了，这一个又要死了，”他心里想，“美好的灵魂不能在这个世界上待久的。真是，伟大的感情怎么能跟一个猥琐、狭小、浅薄的社会沆瀣一气呢？”

他参加的那个盛会的景象在脑海中浮起来，同眼前这个病人垂死的景象成为对比。皮安训突然奔进来叫道：

“喂，欧也纳，我才见到我们的主任医师，就奔回来了。要是他忽然清醒，说起话来，你把他放倒在一长条芥子膏药上，让芥末把颈窝到腰部下面一齐裹住；再教人通知我们。”

“亲爱的皮安训！”欧也纳说。

“哦！这是为了科学。”医学生说，他的热心像一个刚改信宗教的人。

欧也纳说：“那么只有我一个人是为了感情照顾他了。”

皮安训听了并不生气，只说：“你要看到我早上的模样，就不会说这种话了。告诉你，朋友，开业的医生眼里只有疾病，我还看见病人呢。”

他走了。欧也纳单独陪着病人，唯恐高潮就要发作。不久高潮果然来了。

“啊！是你，亲爱的孩子。”高老头认出了欧也纳。

“你好些吗？”大学生拿着他的手问。

“好一些。刚才我的脑袋好似夹在钳子里，现在松一点儿了。你可曾看见我的女儿？她们马上要来了，一知道我害病，会立刻赶来的。从前在于西安街，她们服侍过我多少回！天哪！我真想把屋子收拾干净，好招待她们。有个年轻人把我的泥炭烧完了。”

欧也纳说：“我听见克利斯朵夫的声音，他替你搬木柴来，就是那个年轻人给你送来的。”

“好吧！可是拿什么付账呢？我一个钱都没有了，孩子。我把一切都给了，一切。我变了叫花子了。至少那件金线衫好看吗？（啊唷！我痛！）谢谢你，克利斯朵夫。上帝会报答你的，孩子；我啊，我什么都没有了。”

欧也纳凑着男用人的耳朵说：“我不会教你和西尔维白忙的。”

“克利斯朵夫，是不是我两个女儿告诉你就要来了？你再去一次，我给你五法郎。对她们说我觉得不好，我临死之前还想拥抱她们，再看她们一次。你这样去说吧，可是别过分吓了她们。”

克利斯朵夫看见欧也纳对他递了个眼色，便动身了。

“她们要来了，”老人又说，“我知道她们的脾气。好但斐纳，我死了，她要怎样地伤心呀！还有娜齐也是的。我不愿意死，因为不愿意让她们哭。我的好欧也纳，死，死就是再也看不见她们。在那个世界里，我要闷得发慌哩。看不见孩子，做父亲的等于入了地狱；自从她们结了婚，我就尝着这个味道。我的天堂是于西安街。嗳！喂，倘使我进了天堂，我的灵魂还能回到她们身边吗？听说有这种事情，可是真的？我现在清清楚楚看见她们在于西安街的模样。她们一早下楼，说：爸爸，你早。我把她们抱在膝上，用种种花样逗她们玩儿，跟她们淘气。她们也跟我亲热一阵。我们天天一块儿吃中饭，一块儿吃晚饭，总之那时我是父亲，看着孩子直乐。在于西安街，她们不跟我讲嘴，一点不懂人事，她们很爱我。天哪！干吗她们要长大呢？（哎唷！我痛啊；头里在抽。）啊！啊！对不起。孩子们！我痛死了；要不是真痛，我不会叫的，你们早已把我训练得不怕痛苦了。上帝呀！只消我能握着她们的手，我就不觉得痛啦。你想她们会来吗？克利斯朵夫蠢极了！我该自己去的。他倒有福气看到她们。你昨天去了跳舞会，你告诉我呀，她们怎么样？她们一点不知道我病了，可不是？要不她们不肯去跳舞了，可怜的孩子们！噢！我再也不愿意害病了。她们还少不了我呢。她们的财产遭了危险，又是落在怎样的丈夫手里！把我治好呀，治好呀！（噢！我多难过！哟！哟！哟！）你瞧，非把我医好不行，她们需要钱，我知道到哪儿去挣。我要上奥特赛去做淀粉。我才精明呢，会赚他几百万。（哦呀！我痛死了！）”

高里奥不出声了，仿佛集中全身的精力熬着痛苦。

“她们在这儿，我不会叫苦了，干吗还要叫苦呢？”

他迷迷糊糊昏沉了好久。克利斯朵夫回来，拉斯蒂涅以为高老头睡熟了，让用人高声回报他出差的情形。

“先生，我先上伯爵夫人家，可没法跟她说话，她和丈夫有要紧事儿。我再三央求，特·雷斯多先生亲自出来对我说：高里奥先生快死了是不是？哎，再好没有。我有事，要太太待在家里。事情完了，她会去的。——他似乎很生气，这位先生。我正要出来，太太从一扇我看不见的门里走到穿堂，告诉我：克利斯朵夫，你对我父亲说，我同丈夫正在商量事情，不能来。那是有关我孩子们生死的问题。但等事情一完，我就去看他。——说到男爵夫人吧，又是另外一桩事儿！我没有见到她，不能跟她说话。老妈子说：啊！太太今儿早上五点一刻才从跳舞会回来；中午以前叫醒她，一定要挨骂的。等会她打铃叫我，我会告诉她，说她父亲的病更重了。报告一件坏消息，不会嫌太晚的。——我再三央求也没用。哎，是呀，我也要求见男爵，他不在家。”

“一个也不来，”拉斯蒂涅嚷道，“让我写信给她们。”

“一个也不来，”老人坐起来接着说，“她们有事，她们在睡觉，她们不会来的。我早知道了。直要临死才知道女儿是什么东西！唉！朋友，你别结婚，别生孩子！你给他们生命，他们给你死。你带他们到世界上来，他们把你从世界上赶出去。她们不会来的！我已经知道了十年。有时我心里这么想，只是不敢相信。”

他每只眼中冒出一颗眼泪，滚在鲜红的眼皮边上，不掉下来。

“唉！倘若我有钱，倘若我留着家私，没有把财产给她们，她们就会来，会用她们的亲吻来舐我的脸！我可以住在一所公馆里，有漂亮的屋子，有我的仆人，生着火；她们都要哭作一团，还有她们的丈夫，她们的孩子。这一切我都可以到手。现在可什么都没有。钱能买到一切，买到女儿。啊！我的钱到哪儿去了？倘若我还有财产留下，她们会来伺候我，招呼我；我可以听到她们，看到她们。啊！欧也纳，亲爱的孩子，我唯一的孩子，我宁可给人家遗弃，宁可做个倒霉鬼！倒霉鬼有人爱，至少那是真正的爱！啊，不，我要有钱，那我可以看到她们了。唉，谁知道？她们两个的心都像石头一样。我把所有的爱在她们身上用尽了，她们对我不能再有爱了。做父亲的应该永远有钱，应该拉紧儿女的缰绳，像对付狡猾的马一样。我却向她们下跪。该死的东西！她们十年来对我的行为，现在到了顶点。你不知道她们刚结婚的时候对我怎样的奉承体贴！（噢！我痛得像受毒刑一样！）我才给了她们每人八十万，她们和她们的丈夫都不敢怠慢我。我受到好款待：好爸爸，上这儿来；好爸爸，往那儿去。她们家永远有我的一份刀叉。我同她们的丈夫一块儿吃饭，他们对我很恭敬，看我手头还有一些呢。为什么？因为我生意的底细，我一句没提。一个给了女儿八十万的人是应该奉承的。他们对我那么周到、体贴，那是为我的钱啊。世界并不美。我看到了，我！她们陪我坐着车子上戏院，我在她们的晚会里爱待多久就待多久。她们承认是我的女儿，承认我是她们的父亲。我还有我的聪明呢，嗨，什么都没逃过我的眼睛。我什么都感觉到，我的心碎了。我明明看到那是假情假意；可是没有办法。在她们家，我就不像在这儿饭桌上那么自在。我什么话都不会说。有些漂亮人物咬着我女婿的耳朵问：

——那位先生是谁啊？

——他是财神，他有钱。

——啊，原来如此！

“人家这么说着，恭恭敬敬瞧着我，就像恭恭敬敬瞧着钱一样。即使我有时叫他们发窘，我也补赎了我的过失。再说，谁又是十全的呢？（哎唷！我的脑袋简直是块烂疮！）我这时的痛苦是临死以前的痛苦，亲爱的欧也纳先生，可是比起当年娜齐第一次瞪着我给我的难受，眼前的痛苦算不了什么。那时她瞪我一眼，因为我说错了话，丢了她的脸；唉，她那一眼把我全身的血管都割破了。我很想懂得交际场中的规矩；可是我只懂得一样：我在世界上是多余的。第二天我上但斐纳家去找安慰，不料又闹了笑话，惹她冒火。我为此急疯了。八天工夫我不知道怎么办。我不敢去看她们，怕受埋怨。这样，我便进不了女儿的大门。哦！我的上帝！既然我吃的苦，受的难，你全知道，既然我受的千刀万剐，使我头发变白，身子磨坏的伤，你都记在账上，干吗今日还要我受这个罪？就算太爱她们是我的罪过，我受的刑罚也足够补赎了。我对她们的慈爱，她们都狠狠地报复了，像刽子手一般把我上过毒刑了。唉！做老子的多蠢！我太爱她们了，每次都回头去迁就她们，好像赌棍离不开赌场。我的嗜好，我的情妇，我的一切，便是两个女儿，她们俩想要一点儿装饰品什么的，老妈子告诉了我，我就去买来送给她们，巴望得到些好款待！可是她们看了我在人前的态度，照样来一番教训。而且等不到第二天！喝，她们为着我脸红了。这是给儿女受好教育的报应。我活了这把年纪，可不能再上学校啦。（我痛死了，天哪！医生呀！医生呀！把我脑袋劈开来，也许会好些。）我的女儿呀，我的女儿呀，娜齐，但斐纳！我要看她们。叫警察去找她们来，抓她们来！法律应该帮我的，天性，民法，都应该帮我。我要抗议。把父亲踩在脚下，国家不要亡了吗？这是很明白的。社会，世界，都是靠父道做轴心的；儿女不孝父亲，不要天翻地覆吗？哦！看到她们，听到她们，不管她们说些什么，只要听见她们的声音，尤其但斐纳，我就不觉得痛苦。等她们来了，你叫她们别那么冷冷地瞧我。啊！我的好朋友，欧也纳先生，看到她们眼中的金光变得像铅一样不灰不白，你真不知道是什么味儿。自从她们的眼睛对我不放光辉之后，我老在这儿过冬天；只有苦水给我吞，我也就吞下了！我活着就是为受委屈，受侮辱。她们给我一点儿可怜的、小小的、可耻的快乐，代价是教我受种种的羞辱，我都受了，因为我太爱她们了。老子偷偷摸摸地看女儿！听见过没有？我把一辈子的生命给了她们，她们今天连一小时都不给我！我又饥又渴，心在发烧，她们不来苏解一下我的临终苦难。我觉得我要死了。什么叫作践踏父亲的尸首，难道她们不知道吗？天上还有一个上帝，他可不管我们做老子的愿不愿意，要替我们报仇的。噢！她们会来的！来啊，我的小心肝，你们来亲我呀；最后一个亲吻就是你们父亲的临终圣餐了，他会代你们求上帝，说你们一向孝顺，替你们辩护！归根结底，你们没有罪。朋友，她们是没有罪的！请你对大家都这么说，别为了我难为她们。一切都是我的错，是我纵容她们把我踩在脚下的。我就喜欢那样。这跟谁都不相干，人间的裁判，神明的裁判，都不相干。上帝要是为了我责罚她们，就不公平了。我不会做人，是我糊涂，自己放弃了权利。为她们我甚至堕落也甘心情愿！有什么办法！最美的天性，最优秀的灵魂，都免不了溺爱儿女。我是一个糊涂蛋，遭了报应，女儿七颠八倒的生活是我一手造成的，是我惯了她们。现在她们要寻欢作乐，正像她们从前要吃糖果。我一向对她们百依百顺。小姑娘想入非非的欲望，都给她们满足。十五岁就有了车！要什么有什么。罪过都在我一个人身上，为了爱她们而犯的罪。唉，她们的声音能够打开我的心房。我听见她们，她们在来啦。哦！一定的，她们要来的。法律也要人给父亲送终的，法律是支持我的。只要叫人跑一趟就行。我给车钱。你写信去告诉她们，说我还有几百万家私留给她们！我敢起誓。我可以上奥特赛去做高等面食。我有办法。计划中还有几百万好赚。哼，谁也没有想到。那不会像麦子和面粉一样在路上变坏的。嗳，嗳，淀粉哪，有几百万好赚啊！你告诉她们有几百万绝不是扯谎。她们为了贪心还是肯来的；我宁愿受骗，我要看到她们。我要我的女儿！是我把她们生下来的！她们是我的！”他一边说一边在床上挺起身子，给欧也纳看到一张白发凌乱的脸，竭力装作威吓的神气。

欧也纳说：“嗳，嗳，你睡下吧。我来写信给她们。等皮安训来了，她们要再不来，我就自个儿去。”

“她们再不来，”老人一边大哭一边接了一句，“我要死了，要气疯了，气死了！气已经上来了！现在我把我这一辈子都看清楚了。我上了当！她们不爱我，从来没有爱过我！这是摆明的了。她们这时不来是不会来的了。她们越拖，越不肯给我这个快乐。我知道她们。我的悲伤，我的痛苦，我的需要，她们从来没体会到一星半点，连我的死也没有想到；我的爱，我的温情，她们完全不了解。是的，她们把我糟蹋惯了，在她们眼里我所有的牺牲都一文不值。哪怕她们要挖掉我眼睛，我也会说：挖吧！我太傻了。她们以为天下的老子都像她们的一样。想不到你待人好一定要人知道！将来她们的孩子会替我报仇的。唉，来看我还是为她们自己啊。你去告诉她们，说她们临死要受到报应的。犯了这桩罪，等于犯了世界上所有的罪。去啊，去对她们说，不来送我的终是忤逆！不加上这一桩，她们的罪过已经数不清啦。你得像我一样地去叫：哎！娜齐！哎！但斐纳！父亲待你们多好，他在受难，你们来吧！——唉！一个都不来。难道我就像野狗一样地死吗？爱了一辈子的女儿，到头来反给女儿遗弃！简直是些下流东西，流氓婆；我恨她们，咒她们；我半夜里还要从棺材里爬起来咒她们。嗳，朋友，难道这能派我的不是吗？她们做人这样恶劣，是不是！我说什么？你不是告诉我但斐纳在这儿吗？还是她好。你是我的儿子，欧也纳。你，你得爱她，像她父亲一样地爱她。还有一个是遭了难。她们的财产呀！哦！上帝！我要死了，我太苦了！把我的脑袋割掉吧，留给我一颗心就行了。”

“克利斯朵夫，去找皮安训来，顺便替我雇辆车。”欧也纳嚷着。他被老人这些呼天抢地的哭诉吓坏了。

“老伯，我到你女儿家去把她们带来。”

“把她们抓来，抓来！叫警卫队，叫军队！”老人说着，对欧也纳瞪了一眼，闪出最后一道理性的光，“去告诉政府，告诉检察官，叫人替我带来！”

“你刚才咒过她们了。”

老人愣了一愣，说：“谁说的？你知道我是爱她们的，疼她们的！我看到她们，病就好啦……去吧，我的好邻居，好孩子，去吧，你是慈悲的；我要重重地谢你；可是我什么都没有了，只能给你一个祝福，一个临死的人的祝福。啊！至少我要看到但斐纳，吩咐她代我报答你。那个不能来，就带这个来吧。告诉她，她要不来，你不爱她了。她多爱你，一定会来的。哟，我渴死了，五脏六腑都在烧！替我在头上放点儿什么吧。最好是女儿的手，那我就得救了，我觉得的……天哪！我死了，谁替她们挣钱呢？我要为她们上奥特赛去，上奥特赛做面条生意。”

欧也纳搀起病人，用左臂扶着，另一只手端给他一杯满满的药茶，说道：“你喝这个。”

“你一定要爱你的父母，”老人说着，有气无力地握着欧也纳的手，“你懂得吗，我要死了，不见她们一面就死了。永远口渴而没有水喝，这便是我十年来的生活……两个女婿断送了我的女儿。是的，从她们出嫁之后，我就没有女儿了。做老子的听着！你们得要求国会定一条结婚的法律！要是你们爱女儿，就不能把她们嫁人。女婿是毁坏女儿的坏蛋，他把一切都污辱了。再不要有结婚这回事！结婚抢走我们的女儿，教我们临死看不见女儿。为了父亲的死，应该定一条法律。真是可怕！报仇呀！报仇呀！是我女婿不准她们来的呀。杀死他们！杀雷斯多！杀纽沁根！他们是我的凶手！不还我女儿，就要他们的命！唉！完啦，我见不到她们的了！她们！娜齐，斐斐纳，喂，来呀，爸爸出门啦……”[1]

“老伯，你静静吧，别生气，别多想。”

“看不见她们，这才是我的临终苦难！”

“你会看见的。”

“真的！”老人迷迷惘惘地叫起来，“噢！看到她们！我还会看到她们，听到她们的声音。那我死也死得快乐了。唉，是啊，我不想活了，我不稀罕活了，我痛得越来越厉害了。可是看到她们，碰到她们的衣衫，唉！只要她们的衣衫，衣衫，就这么一点儿要求！只消让我摸到她们的一点儿什么！让我抓一把她们的头发，……头发……”

他仿佛挨了一棍，脑袋往枕上倒下，双手在被单上乱抓，好像要抓女儿们的头发。

他又挣扎着说：“我祝福她们，祝福她们。”

然后他昏过去了。皮安训进来说：

“我碰到了克利斯朵夫，他替你雇车去了。”

他瞧了瞧病人，用力揭开他的眼皮，两个大学生只看到一只没有颜色的灰暗的眼睛。

“完啦，”皮安训说，“我看他不会醒的了。”

他按了按脉，摸索了一会，把手放在老头儿心口。

“机器没有停；像他这样反而受罪，还是早点去的好！”

“对，我也这么想。”拉斯蒂涅回答。

“你怎么啦？脸色发白像死人一样。”

“朋友，我听他又哭又叫，说了一大堆。真有一个上帝！哦，是的，上帝是有的，他替我们预备着另外一个世界，一个好一点儿的世界。咱们这个太混账了。刚才的情形要不那么悲壮，我早哭死啦，我的心跟胃都给揪紧了。”

“喂，还得办好多事，哪儿来的钱呢？”

拉斯蒂涅掏出表来：

“你送当铺去。我路上不能耽搁，只怕赶不及。现在我等着克利斯朵夫，我身上一个钱都没有了，回来还得付车钱。”

拉斯蒂涅奔下楼梯，上海尔特街特·雷斯多太太家去了。刚才那幕可怕的景象使他动了感情，一路义愤填胸。他走进穿堂求见特·雷斯多太太，人家回报说她不能见客。

他对当差说：“我是为了她马上要死的父亲来的。”

“先生，伯爵再三吩咐我们……”

“既然伯爵在家，那么告诉他，说他岳父快死了，我要立刻和他说话。”

欧也纳等了好久。

“说不定他就在这个时候死了。”他心里想。

当差带他走进第一客室，特·雷斯多先生站在没有生火的壁炉前面，见了客人也不请坐。

“伯爵，”拉斯蒂涅说，“令岳在破烂的阁楼上就要断气了，连买木柴的钱也没有；他马上要死了，但等见一面女儿……”

“先生，”伯爵冷冷地回答，“你大概可以看出，我对高里奥先生没有什么好感。他教坏了我太太，造成我家庭的不幸。我把他当作扰乱我安宁的敌人。他死也好，活也好，我全不在意。你瞧，这是我对他的情分。社会尽可以责备我，我才不在乎呢。我现在要处理的事，比顾虑那些傻瓜的闲言闲语紧要得多。至于我太太，她现在那个模样没法出门，我也不让她出门。请你告诉她父亲，只消她对我，对我的孩子，尽完了她的责任，她会去看他的。要是她爱她的父亲，几分钟内她就可以自由……”

“伯爵，我没有权利批评你的行为，你是你太太的主人。可是至少我能相信你是讲信义的吧？请你答应我一件事，就是告诉她，说她父亲没有一天好活了，因为她不去送终，已经在咒她了！”

雷斯多注意到欧也纳愤愤不平的语气，回答道：“你自己去说吧。”

拉斯蒂涅跟着伯爵走进伯爵夫人平时起坐的客厅。她泪人儿似的埋在沙发里，那副痛不欲生的模样叫他看了可怜。她不敢望拉斯蒂涅，先怯生生地瞧了瞧丈夫，眼睛的神气表示她精神肉体都被专横的丈夫压倒了。伯爵侧了侧脑袋，她才敢开口：

“先生，我都听到了。告诉我父亲，他要知道我现在的处境，一定会原谅我。我想不到要受这种刑罚，简直受不了。可是我要反抗到底，”她对她的丈夫说，“我也有儿女。请你对父亲说，不管表面上怎么样，在父亲面前我并没有错。”她无可奈何地对欧也纳说。

那女的经历的苦难，欧也纳不难想象，便呆呆地走了出来。听到特·雷斯多先生的口吻，他知道自己白跑了一趟，阿娜斯大齐已经失去自由。

接着他赶到特·纽沁根太太家，发觉她还在床上。

“我不舒服呀，朋友，”她说，“从跳舞会出来受了凉，我怕要害肺炎呢，我等医生来……”

欧也纳打断了她的话，说道：“哪怕死神已经到了你身边，爬也得爬到你父亲跟前去。他在叫你！你要听到他一声，马上不觉得你自己害病了。”

“欧也纳，父亲的病也许不像你说的那么严重；可是我要在你眼里有什么不是，我才难过死呢；所以我一定听你的吩咐。我知道，倘若我这一回出去闹出一场大病来，父亲要伤心死的。我等医生来过了就走。”她一眼看不见欧也纳身上的表链，便叫道：“哟！怎么你的表没有啦？”

欧也纳脸上红了一块。

“欧也纳！欧也纳！倘使你已经把它卖了，丢了……哦！那太岂有此理了。”

大学生伏在但斐纳床上，凑着她耳朵说：

“你要知道吗？哼！好，告诉你吧！你父亲一个钱没有了，今晚上要把他入殓的尸衣[2]都没法买。你送我的表在当铺里，我钱都光了。”

但斐纳猛地从床上跳下，奔向书柜，抓起钱袋递给拉斯蒂涅，打着铃，嚷道：

“我去我去，欧也纳。让我穿衣服，我简直是禽兽了！去吧，我会赶在你前面！”她回头叫老妈子：“丹兰士，请老爷立刻上来跟我说话。”

欧也纳因为能对垂死的老人报告有一个女儿会来，几乎很快乐地回到圣·日内维新街。他在但斐纳的钱袋里掏了一阵打发车钱，发觉这位那么有钱那么漂亮的少妇，袋中只有七十法郎。他走完楼梯，看见皮安训扶着高老头，医院的外科医生当着内科医生在病人背上做灸。这是科学的最后一套治疗，没用的治疗。

“替你做灸你觉得吗？”内科医生问。

高老头看见了大学生，说道：

“她们来了是不是？”

外科医生道：“还有希望，他说话了。”

欧也纳回答老人：“是的，但斐纳就来了。”

“呃！”皮安训说，“他还在提他的女儿，他拼命地叫她们，像一个人吊在刑台上叫着要喝水……”

“算了吧，”内科医生对外科医生说，“没法的了，没救的了。”

皮安训和外科医生把快死的病人放倒在发臭的破床上。

医生说：“总得给他换套衣服，虽则毫无希望，他究竟是个人。”他又招呼皮安训：“我等会儿再来。他要叫苦，就给他横膈膜上搽些鸦片。”

两个医生走了，皮安训说：

“来，欧也纳，拿出勇气来！咱们替他换上一件白衬衫，换一条褥单。你叫西尔维拿了床单来帮我们。”

欧也纳下楼，看见伏盖太太正帮着西尔维摆刀叉。拉斯蒂涅才说了几句，寡妇就迎上来，装着一副又和善又难看的神气，活现出一个满腹猜疑的老板娘，既不愿损失金钱，又不敢得罪主顾。

“亲爱的欧也纳先生，你和我一样知道高老头没有钱了。把被单拿给一个正在翻眼睛的人，不是白送吗？另外还得牺牲一条做他入殓的尸衣。你们已经欠我一百四十四法郎，加上四十法郎被单，以及旁的零星杂费，跟等会儿西尔维要给你们的蜡烛，至少也得二百法郎；我一个寡妇怎受得了这样一笔损失？天啊！你也得凭凭良心，欧也纳先生。自从晦气星进了我的门，五天工夫我已经损失得够了。我愿意花三十法郎打发这好家伙归天，像你们说的。这种事还要叫我的房客不愉快。只要不花钱，我愿意送他进医院。总之你替我想想吧。我的铺子要紧，那是我的，我的性命呀。”

欧也纳赶紧奔上高里奥的屋子。

“皮安训，押了表的钱呢？”

“在桌子上，还剩三百六十多法郎。欠的账已经还清。当票压在钱下面。”

“喂，太太，”拉斯蒂涅愤愤地奔下楼梯，说道，“来算账。高里奥先生在府上不会耽久了，而我……”

“是的，他只能两脚向前地出去的了，可怜的人。”她一边说一边数着二百法郎，神气之间有点高兴，又有点惆怅。

“快点儿吧。”拉斯蒂涅催她。

“西尔维，拿出褥单来，到上面去给两位先生帮忙。”

“别忘了西尔维，”伏盖太太凑着欧也纳的耳朵说，“她两晚没有睡觉了。”

欧也纳刚转身，老寡妇立刻奔向厨娘，咬着她耳朵吩咐：

“你找第七号褥单，那条旧翻新的。反正给死人用总是够好的了。”

欧也纳已经在楼梯上跨了几步，没有听见房东的话。

皮安训说：“来，咱们替他穿衬衫，你把他扶着。”

欧也纳站在床头扶着快死的人，让皮安训脱下衬衫。老人做了个手势，仿佛要保护胸口的什么东西，同时哼哼唧唧，发出些不成音的哀号，犹如野兽表示极大的痛苦。

“哦！哦！”皮安训说，“他要一根头发链子和一个小小的胸章，刚才咱们做灸拿掉的。可怜的人，给他挂上。喂，在壁炉架上面。”

欧也纳拿来一条淡黄带灰的头发编成的链子，准是高里奥太太的头发。胸章的一面刻着：阿娜斯大齐；另外一面刻着：但斐纳。这是他永远贴在心头的心影。胸章里面藏着极细的头发卷，大概是女儿们极小的时候剪下来的。发辫挂上他的脖子，胸章一碰到胸脯，老人便心满意足地长叹一声，叫人听了毛骨悚然。他的感觉这样振动了一下，似乎往那个神秘的区域，发出同情和接受同情的中心，隐没了。抽搐的脸上有一种病态的快乐的表情。思想消灭了，情感还存在，还能发出这种可怕的光彩，两个大学生看着大为感动，涌出几颗热泪掉在病人身上，使他快乐得直叫：

“噢！娜齐！斐斐纳！”

“他还活着呢。”皮安训说。

“活着有什么用？”西尔维说。

“受罪啰！”拉斯蒂涅回答。

皮安训向欧也纳递了个眼色，教他跟自己一样蹲下身子，把胳膊抄到病人腿肚子下面，两人隔着床做着同样的动作，托住病人的背。西尔维站在旁边，等他们抬起身子，抽换被单。高里奥大概误会了刚才的眼泪，使出最后一些气力伸出手来，在床的两边碰到两个大学生的脑袋，拼命抓着他们的头发，轻轻地叫了声：“啊！我的儿哪！”整个灵魂都在这两句里面，而灵魂也随着这两句喁语飞逝了。

“可怜可爱的人哪。”西尔维说，她也被这声哀叹感动了。这声哀叹，表示那伟大的父爱受了又惨又无心的欺骗，最后激动了一下。

这个父亲的最后一声叹息还是快乐的叹息。这叹息说明了他的一生，他还是骗了自己。大家恭恭敬敬把高老头放倒在破床上。从这个时候起，喜怒哀乐的意识消灭了，只有生与死的搏斗还在他脸上印着痛苦的标记。整个的毁灭不过是时间问题了。

“他还可以这样地拖几小时，在我们不知不觉的时候死去。他连临终的痰厥也不会有，脑子全部充血了。”

这时楼梯上有一个气咻咻的少妇的脚声。

“来得太晚了。”拉斯蒂涅说。

来的不是但斐纳，是她的老妈子丹兰士。

“欧也纳先生，可怜的太太为父亲向先生要钱，先生和她大吵。她晕过去了，医生也来了，恐怕要替她放血。她嚷着：爸爸要死了，我要去看爸爸呀！叫人听了心惊肉跳。”

“算了吧，丹兰士。现在来也不中用了，高里奥先生已经昏迷了。”

丹兰士道：“可怜的先生，竟病得这样凶吗？”

“你们用不着我了，我要下去开饭，已经四点半了。”西尔维说着，在楼梯台上几乎觉得撞在特·雷斯多太太身上。

伯爵夫人的出现叫人觉得又严肃又可怕。床边黑魆魆的只点着一支蜡烛。瞧着父亲那张还有几分生命在颤动的脸，她掉下泪来。皮安训很识趣地退了出去。

“恨我没有早些逃出来。”伯爵夫人对拉斯蒂涅说。

大学生悲伤地点点头。她拿起父亲的手亲吻。

“原谅我，父亲！你说我的声音可以把你从坟墓里叫回来，哎！那么你回来一忽儿，来祝福你正在忏悔的女儿吧。听我说啊。——真可怕！这个世界上只有你会祝福我。大家恨我，只有你爱我。连我自己的孩子将来也要恨我。你带我一块儿去吧，我会爱你，服侍你。噢！他听不见了，我疯了。”

她双膝跪下，疯子似的端详着那个躯壳。

“我什么苦都受到了，”她望着欧也纳说，“特·脱拉伊先生走了，丢下一身的债。而且我发觉他欺骗我。丈夫永远不会原谅我了，我已经把全部财产交给他。唉！一场空梦，为了谁来！我欺骗了唯一疼我的人！（她指着她的父亲）我辜负他，嫌多他，给他受尽苦难，我这该死的人！”

“他知道。”拉斯蒂涅说。

高老头忽然睁了睁眼，但只不过是肌肉的抽搐。伯爵夫人表示希望的手势，同弥留的人的眼睛一样凄惨。

“他还会听见我吗？——哦，听不见的了。”她坐在床边自言自语。

特·雷斯多太太说要守着父亲，欧也纳便下楼吃饭。房客都到齐了。

“喂，”画家招呼他，“看样子咱们楼上要死掉个把人了啦嘛？”

“查理，找点儿少凄惨的事开玩笑好不好？”欧也纳说。

“难道咱们就不能笑了吗？”画家回答，“有什么关系，皮安训说他已经昏迷了。”

“嗳！”博物院管事接着说，“他活也罢，死也罢，反正没有分别。”

“父亲死了！”伯爵夫人大叫一声。

一听见这声可怕的叫喊，西尔维、拉斯蒂涅、皮安训，一齐上楼，发觉特·雷斯多太太晕过去了。他们把她救醒了，送上等在门外的车；欧也纳嘱咐丹兰士小心看护，送往特·纽沁根太太家。

“哦！这一下他真死了。”皮安训下楼说。

“诸位，吃饭吧，汤冷了。”伏盖太太招呼众人。

两个大学生并肩坐下。

欧也纳问皮安训：“现在该怎么办？”

“我把他眼睛阖上了，四肢放得端端正正。等咱们上市政府报告死亡，那边的医生来验过之后，把他包上尸衣埋掉。你还想怎么办？”

“他不能再这样嗅他的面包了。”一个房客学着高老头的鬼脸说。

“要命！”当助教的叫道，“诸位能不能丢开高老头，让我们清静一下？一个钟点以来，只听见他的事儿。巴黎这个地方有桩好处，一个人可以生下，活着，死去，没有人理会。这种文明的好处，咱们应当享受。今天死六十个人，难道你们都去哀悼那些亡灵不成？高老头死就死吧，为他还是死的好！要是你们疼他，就去守灵，让我们消消停停地吃饭。”

“噢！是的，”寡妇道，“他真是死了的好！听说这可怜的人苦了一辈子！”

在欧也纳心中，高老头是父爱的代表，可是他身后得到的唯一的诔词，就是上面这几句。十五位房客照常谈天。欧也纳和皮安训听着刀叉声和谈笑声，眼看那些人狼吞虎咽，不关痛痒的表情，难受得心都凉了。他们吃完饭，出去找一个神父来守夜，给死者祈祷。手头只有一点儿钱，不能不看钱办事。晚上九点，遗体放在便榻上，两旁点着两支蜡烛，屋内空空的，只有一个神父坐在他旁边。临睡之前，拉斯蒂涅向教士打听了礼忏和送葬的价目，写信给特·纽沁根男爵和特·雷斯多伯爵，请他们派管事来打发丧费。他要克利斯朵夫把信送出去，方始上床。他疲倦之极，马上睡着了。

第二天早上，皮安训和拉斯蒂涅亲自上市政府报告死亡；中午，医生来签了字。过了两小时，一个女婿都没送钱来，也没派人来，拉斯蒂涅只得先开销了教士。西尔维讨了十法郎去缝尸衣。欧也纳和皮安训算了算，死者的家属要不负责的话，他们倾其所有，只能极勉强地应付一切开支。把尸身放入棺材的差事，由医学生担任了去；那口穷人用的棺木也是他向医院特别便宜买来的。他对欧也纳说：

“咱们给那些浑蛋开一下玩笑吧。你到拉希公墓去买一块地，五年为期；再向丧礼代办所和教堂定一套三等丧仪。要是女婿女儿不还你的钱，你就在墓上立一块碑，刻上几个字：


特·雷斯多伯爵夫人暨特·纽沁根男爵夫人之　尊翁

高里奥先生之墓　　　　　　　大学生二人醵资代葬。”



欧也纳在特·纽沁根夫妇和特·雷斯多夫妇家奔走毫无结果，只得听从他朋友的意见。在两位女婿府上，他只能到大门为止。门房都奉有严令，说：

“先生跟太太谢绝宾客。他们的父亲死了，悲痛得了不得。”

欧也纳对巴黎社会已有相当经验，知道不能固执。看到没法跟但斐纳见面，他心里感到一阵异样的压迫，在门房里写了一个字条：


“请你卖掉一件首饰吧，使你父亲下葬的时候成个体统。”



他封了字条，吩咐男爵的门房递给丹兰士送交女主人；门房却送给男爵，被他往火炉里一扔了事。欧也纳部署停当，三点左右回到公寓，望见小门口停着口棺木，在静悄悄的街头，搁在两张凳上，棺木上面连那块黑布也没有遮盖到家。他一见这光景，不由得掉下泪来。谁也不曾把手蘸过的蹩脚圣水壶，[3]浸在盛满圣水的镀银盘子里。门上黑布也没有挂。这是穷人的丧礼，既没排场，也没后代，也没朋友，也没亲属。皮安训因为医院有事，留了一个便条给拉斯蒂涅，告诉他跟教堂办的交涉。他说追思弥撒价钱贵得惊人，只能做个便宜的晚祷；至于丧礼代办所，已经派克利斯朵夫送了信去。欧也纳看完字条，忽然瞧见藏着两个女儿头发的胸章在伏盖太太手里。

“你怎么敢拿下这个东西？”他说。

“天哪！难道把它下葬不成？”西尔维回答，“那是金的啊。”

“当然啰！”欧也纳愤愤地说，“代表两个女儿的只有这一点东西，还不给他带去么？”

柩车上门的时候，欧也纳叫人把棺木重新抬上楼，他撬开钉子，诚心诚意地把那颗胸章，姊妹俩还年轻、天真、纯洁，像他在临终呼号中所说的“不懂得讲嘴”的时代的形象，挂在死人胸前。除了两个丧礼执事，只有拉斯蒂涅和克利斯朵夫两人跟着柩车，把可怜的人送往圣·丹蒂安·杜·蒙，离圣·日内维新街不远的教堂。灵柩被放在一所低矮黝黑的圣堂[4]前面。大学生四下里张望，看不见高老头的两个女儿或者女婿。除他之外，只有克利斯朵夫因为赚过他不少酒钱，觉得应当尽一尽最后的礼教。两个教士、唱诗班的孩子和教堂管事都还没有到。拉斯蒂涅握了握克利斯朵夫的手，一句话也说不上来。

“是的，欧也纳先生，”克利斯朵夫说，“他是个老实人，好人，从来没大声说过一句话，从来没损害别人，也从来没干过坏事。”

两个教士、唱诗班的孩子、教堂的管事都来了。在一个宗教没有余钱给穷人作义务祈祷的时代，他们做了尽七十法郎所能办到的礼忏：唱了一段圣诗，唱了解放和来自灵魂深处。全部礼忏花了二十分钟。送丧的车只有一辆，给教士和唱诗班的孩子乘坐，他们答应带欧也纳和克利斯朵夫同去。教士说：

“没有送丧的行列，我们可以赶一赶，免得耽搁时间。已经五点半了。”

正当灵柩上车的时节，特·雷斯多和特·纽沁根两家有爵徽的空车忽然出现，跟着柩车到拉希公墓。六点钟，高老头的遗体下了墓穴，周围站着女儿家中的管事。大学生出钱买来的短短的祈祷刚念完，那些管事就跟神父一齐溜了。两个盖坟的工人，在棺木上扔了几铲子土挺了挺腰；其中一个走来向拉斯蒂涅讨酒钱。欧也纳掏来掏去，一个子儿都没有，只得向克利斯朵夫借了一法郎。这件很小的小事，忽然使拉斯蒂涅大为伤心。白日将尽，潮湿的黄昏使他心里乱糟糟的；他瞧着墓穴，埋葬了他青年人的最后一滴眼泪，神圣的感情在一颗纯洁的心中逼出来的眼泪，从它堕落的地下立刻回到天上的眼泪。[5]他抱着手臂，凝神瞧着天空的云。克利斯朵夫见他这副模样，径自走了。

拉斯蒂涅一个人在公墓内向高处走了几步，远眺巴黎，只见巴黎蜿蜒曲折地躺在塞纳河两岸，慢慢地亮起灯火。他的欲火炎炎的眼睛停在旺多姆广场和安伐里特宫的穹隆之间。那便是他不胜向往的上流社会的区域。面对这个热闹的蜂房，他射了一眼，好像恨不得把其中的甘蜜一口吸尽。同时他气概非凡地说了句：

“现在咱们俩来拼一拼吧！”

然后拉斯蒂涅为了向社会挑战，到特·纽沁根太太家吃饭去了。

FATHER GORIOT





FATHER GORIOT


To the great and illustrious Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, a token of admiration for his works and genius.

De Balzac.

MME. VAUQUER (née de Conflans) is an elderly person, who for the past forty years has kept a lodging-house in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève, in the district that lies between the Latin Quarter and the Faubourg Saint-Marcel. Her house (known in the neighborhood as the Maison Vauquer) receives men and women, old and young, and no word has ever been breathed against her respectable establishment; but, at the same time, it must be said that as a matter of fact no young woman has been under her roof for thirty years, and that if a young man stays there for any length of time it is a sure sign that his allowance must be of the slenderest. In 1819, however, the time when this drama opens, there was an almost penniless young girl among Mme. Vauquer's boarders.

That word drama has been somewhat discredited of late; it has been overworked and twisted to strange uses in these days of dolorous literature; but it must do service again here, not because this story is dramatic in the restricted sense of the word, but because some tears may perhaps be shed intra et extra muros before it is over.

Will any one without the walls of Paris understand it? It is open to doubt. The only audience who could appreciate the results of close observation, the careful reproduction of minute detail and local color, are dwellers between the heights of Montrouge and Montmartre, in a vale of crumbling stucco watered by streams of black mud, a vale of sorrows which are real and of joys too often hollow; but this audience is so accustomed to terrible sensations that only some unimaginable and well-nigh impossible woe could produce any lasting impression there. Now and again there are tragedies so awful and so grand by reason of the complication of virtues and vices that bring them about, that egoism and selfishness are forced to pause and are moved to pity; but the impression that they receive is like a luscious fruit, soon consumed. Civilization, like the car of Juggernaut, is scarcely stayed perceptibly in its progress by a heart less easy to break than the others that lie in its course; this also is broken, and Civilization continues on her course triumphant. And you, too, will do the like; you who with this book in your white hand will sink back among the cushions of your armchair, and say to yourself: "Perhaps this may amuse me." You will read the story of Old Goriot's secret woes, and, dining thereafter with an unspoiled appetite, will lay the blame of your insensibility upon the writer, and accuse him of exaggeration, of writing romances. Ah! once for all, this drama is neither a fiction nor a romance! All is true—so true that every one can discern the elements of the tragedy in his own house, perhaps in his own heart.

The lodging-house is Mme. Vauquer's own property. It is still standing at the lower end of the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève, just where the road slopes so sharply down to the Rue de l'Arbalète that wheeled traffic seldom passes that way, because it is so stony and steep. This position is sufficient to account for the silence prevalent in the streets shut in between the dome of the Panthéon and the dome of the Val-de-Grâce, two conspicuous public buildings which give a yellowish tone to the landscape and darken the whole district that lies beneath the shadow of their leaden-hued cupolas.

In that district the pavements are clean and dry, there is neither mud nor water in the gutters, grass grows in the chinks of the walls. The most heedless passer-by feels the depressing influences of a place where the sound of wheels creates a sensation; there is a grim look about the houses, a suggestion of a jail about those high garden walls. A Parisian straying into a suburb apparently composed of lodging-houses and public institutions would see poverty and dullness, old age lying down to die, and joyous youth condemned to drudgery. It is the ugliest quarter of Paris, and, it may be added, the least known. But, before all things, the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève is like a bronze frame for a picture for which the mind cannot be too well prepared by the contemplation of sad hues and sober images. Even so, step by step the daylight decreases, and the cicerone's droning voice grows hollower as the traveler descends into the Catacombs. The comparison holds good! Who shall say which is more ghastly, the sight of the bleached skulls or of dried-up human hearts?

The front of the lodging-house is at right angles to the road, and looks out upon a little garden, so that you see the side of the house in section, as it were, from the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève. Beneath the wall of the house front there lies a channel, a fathom wide, paved with cobble-stones, and beside it runs a graveled walk bordered by geraniums and oleanders and pomegranates set in great blue and white glazed earthenware pots. Access into the graveled walk is afforded by a door, above which the words MAISON VAUQUER may be read, and beneath, in rather smaller letters, "Lodgings for both sexes, and others. "

During the day a glimpse into the garden is easily obtained through a wicket to which a bell is attached. On the opposite wall, at the further end of the graveled walk, a green marble arch was painted once upon a time by a local artist, and in this semblance of a shrine a statue representing Cupid is installed; a Parisian Cupid, so blistered and disfigured that he looks like a candidate for one of the adjacent hospitals, and might suggest an allegory to lovers of symbolism. The half-obliterated inscription on the pedestal beneath determines the date of this work of art, for it bears witness to the widespread enthusiasm felt for Voltaire on his return to Paris in 1777:


Whoe'er thou art, thy master see;

He is, or was, or ought to be.



At night the wicket gate is replaced by a solid door. The little garden is no wider than the front of the house; it is shut in between the wall of the street and the partition wall of the neighboring house. A mantle of ivy conceals the bricks and attracts the eyes of passers-by to an effect which is picturesque in Paris, for each of the walls is covered with trellised vines that yield a scanty dusty crop of fruit, and furnish besides a subject of conversation for Mme. Vauquer and her lodgers; every year the widow trembles for her vintage.

A straight path beneath the walls on either side of the garden leads to a clump of lime-trees at the further end of it; line-trees, as Mme. Vauquer persists in calling them, in spite of the fact that she was a de Conflans, and regardless of repeated corrections from her lodgers.

The central space between the walks is filled with artichokes and rows of pyramid fruit-trees, and surrounded by a border of lettuce, pot-herbs, and parsley. Under the lime-trees there are a few green-painted garden seats and a wooden table, and hither, during the dog-days, such of the lodgers as are rich enough to indulge in a cup of coffee come to take their pleasure, though it is hot enough to roast eggs even in the shade.

The house itself is three stories high, without counting the attics under the roof. It is built of rough stone, and covered with the yellowish stucco that gives a mean appearance to almost every house in Paris. There are five windows in each story in the front of the house; all the blinds visible through the small square panes are drawn up awry, so that the lines are all at cross purposes. At the side of the house there are but two windows on each floor, and the lowest of all are adorned with a heavy iron grating.

Behind the house a yard extends for some twenty feet, a space inhabited by a happy family of pigs, poultry, and rabbits; the wood-shed is situated on the further side, and on the wall between the wood-shed and the kitchen window hangs the meat-safe, just above the place where the sink discharges its greasy streams. The cook sweeps all the refuse out through a little door into the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève, and frequently cleanses the yard with copious supplies of water, under pain of pestilence.

The house might have been built on purpose for its present uses. Access is given by a French window to the first room on the ground floor, a sitting-room which looks out upon the street through the two barred windows already mentioned. Another door opens out of it into the dining-room, which is separated from the kitchen by the well of the staircase, the steps being constructed partly of wood, partly of tiles, which are colored and beeswaxed. Nothing can be more depressing than the sight of that sitting-room. The furniture is covered with horse-hair woven in alternate dull and glossy stripes. There is a round table in the middle, with a black and white marble top, on which there stands, by way of ornament, the inevitable white china tea-service, covered with a half-effaced gilt network. The floor is sufficiently uneven, the wainscot rises to elbow height, and the rest of the wall space is decorated with a varnished paper, on which the principal scenes from Télémaque are depicted, the various classical personages being colored. The subject between the two windows is the banquet given by Calypso to the son of Ulysses, displayed thereon for the admiration of the boarders, and has furnished jokes these forty years to the young men who show themselves superior to their position by making fun of the dinners to which poverty condemns them. The hearth is always so clean and neat that it is evident that a fire is only kindled there on great occasions; the stone chimney-piece is adorned by a couple of vases filled with faded artificial flowers imprisoned under glass shades, on either side of a bluish marble clock in the very worst taste.

The first room exhales an odor for which there is no name in the language, and which should be called the odeur de pension. The damp atmosphere sends a chill through you as you breathe it; it has a stuffy, musty, and rancid quality; it permeates your clothing; after-dinner scents seem to be mingled in it with smells from the kitchen and scullery and the reek of a hospital. It might be possible to describe it if someone should discover a process by which to distil from the atmosphere all the nauseating elements with which it is charged by the catarrhal exhalations of every individual lodger, young or old. Yet, in spite of these stale horrors, the sitting-room is as charming and as delicately perfumed as a boudoir, when compared with the adjoining dining-room.

The paneled walls of that apartment were once painted some color, now a matter of conjecture, for the surface is encrusted with accumulated layers of grimy deposit, which cover it with fantastic outlines. A collection of dim-ribbed glass decanters, metal discs with a satin sheen on them, and piles of blue-edged earthenware plates of Tournay ware cover the sticky surfaces of the sideboards that line the room. In a corner stands a box containing a set of numbered pigeon-holes, in which the lodgers' table napkins, more or less soiled and stained with wine, are kept. Here you see that indestructible furniture never met with elsewhere, which finds its way into lodging-houses much as the wrecks of our civilization drift into hospitals for incurables. You expect in such places as these to find the weather-house whence a Capuchin issues on wet days; you look to find the execrable engravings which spoil your appetite, framed every one in a black varnished frame with a gilt beading round it; you know the sort of tortoise-shell wall-clock, inlaid with copper; the green stove, the Argand lamps, streaked with oil and dust, have met your eyes before. The oil-cloth which covers the long table is so greasy that a waggish externe will write his name on the surface, using his thumb-nail as a style. The chairs are broken-down invalids; the wretched little hempen mats slip away from under your feet without slipping away for good; and finally, the foot-warmers are miserable wrecks, hingeless, charred, broken away about the holes. It would be impossible to give an idea of the old, rotten, shaky, cranky, worm-eaten, halt, maimed, one-eyed, rickety, and ramshackle condition of the furniture without an exhaustive description, which would delay the progress of the story to an extent that impatient people would not pardon. The red tiles of the floor are full of depressions brought about by scouring and periodical renewings of color. In short, there is no illusory grace left to the poverty that reigns here; it is dire, parsimonious, concentrated, threadbare poverty; as yet it has not sunk into the mire, it is only splashed by it, and though not in rags as yet, its clothing is ready to drop to pieces.

This apartment is in all its glory at seven o'clock in the morning, when Mme. Vauquer's cat appears, announcing the near approach of his mistress, and jumps upon the sideboards to sniff at the milk in the bowls, each protected by a plate, while he purrs his morning greeting to the world. A moment later the widow shows her face; she is tricked out in a net cap attached to a false front set on awry, and shuffles into the room in her slipshod fashion. She is an oldish woman, with a bloated countenance and a nose like a parrot's beak set in the middle of it; her fat little hands (she is as sleek as a church rat) and her shapeless, slouching figure are in keeping with the room that reeks of misfortune, where hope is reduced to speculate for the meanest stakes. Mme. Vauquer alone can breathe that tainted air without being disheartened by it. Her face is as fresh as a frosty morning in autumn; there are wrinkles about the eyes that vary in their expression from the set smile of a ballet-dancer to the dark, suspicious scowl of a discounter of bills; in short, she is at once the embodiment and interpretation of her lodging-house, as surely as her lodging-house implies the existence of its mistress. You can no more imagine the one without the other than you can think of a jail without a turnkey. The unwholesome corpulence of the little woman is produced by the life she leads, just as typhus fever is bred in the tainted air of a hospital. The very knitted woolen petticoat that she wears beneath a skirt made of an old gown, with the wadding protruding through the rents in the material, is a sort of epitome of the sitting-room, the dining-room, and the little garden; it discovers the cook, it foreshadows the lodgers—the picture of the house is completed by the portrait of its mistress.

Mme. Vauquer at the age of fifty is like all women who "have seen a deal of trouble." She has the glassy eyes and innocent air of a procuress, who will wax virtuously indignant to obtain a higher price for her services, but who is quite ready to betray a Georges or a Pichegru, if a Georges or a Pichegru were in hiding and still to be betrayed, or for any other expedient that may alleviate her lot. Still, "she is a good woman at heart," said the lodgers, who believed that the widow was wholly dependent upon the money that they paid her, and sympathized when they heard her cough and groan like one of themselves.

What had M. Vauquer been? The lady was never very explicit on this head. How had he lost his money? "Through trouble," was her answer. He had treated her badly, had left her nothing but her eyes to cry over his cruelty, the house she lived in, and the privilege of pitying nobody, because, so she was wont to say, she herself had been through every possible misfortune.

Sylvie, the stout cook, hearing her mistress' shuffling footsteps, hastened to serve the lodgers' breakfasts. Beside those who lived in the house, Mme. Vauquer took boarders who came for their meals; but these externes usually only came to dinner, for which they paid thirty francs a month.

At the time when this story begins, the lodging-house contained seven inmates. The best rooms in the house were on the first story, Mme. Vauquer herself occupying the least important, while the rest were let to a Mme. Couture, the widow of a paymaster in the service of the Republic. With her lived Victorine Taillefer, a schoolgirl, to whom she filled the place of mother. These two ladies paid eighteen hundred francs a year.

The two sets of rooms on the second floor were respectively occupied by an old man named Poiret and a man of forty or thereabouts, the wearer of a black wig and dyed whiskers, who gave out that he was a retired merchant, and was addressed as M. Vautrin. Two of the four rooms on the third floor were also let—one to an elderly spinster, a Mlle. Michonneau, and the other to a retired manufacturer of vermicelli, Italian paste, and starch, who allowed the others to address him as "Old Gorito." The remaining rooms were allotted to various birds of passage, to impecunious students, who, like "Old Gorito" and Mlle. Michonneau, could only muster forty-five francs a month to pay for their board and lodging. Mme. Vauquer had little desire for lodgers of this sort; they ate too much bread, and she only took them in default of better.

At that time one of the rooms was tenanted by a law student, a young man from the neighborhood of Angoulême, one of a large family who pinched and starved themselves to spare twelve hundred francs a year for him. Misfortune had accustomed Eugène de Rastignac, for that was his name, to work. He belonged to the number of young men who know as children that their parents' hopes are centered on them, and deliberately prepare themselves for a great career, subordinating their studies from the first to this end, carefully watching the indications of the course of events, calculating the probable turn that affairs will take, that they may be the first to profit by them. But for his observant curiosity, and the skill with which he managed to introduce himself into the salons of Paris, this story would not have been colored by the tones of truth which it certainly owes to him, for they are entirely due to his penetrating sagacity and desire to fathom the mysteries of an appalling condition of things, which was concealed as carefully by the victim as by those who had brought it to pass.

Above the third story there was a garret where the linen was hung to dry, and a couple of attics. Christophe, the man-of-all-work, slept in one, and Sylvie, the stout cook, in the other. Beside the seven inmates thus enumerated, taking one year with another, some eight law or medical students dined in the house, as well as two or three regular comers who lived in the neighborhood. There were usually eighteen people at dinner, and there was room, if need be, for twenty at Mme. Vauquer's table; at breakfast, however, only the seven lodgers appeared. It was almost like a family party. Every one came down in dressing-gown and slippers, and the conversation usually turned on anything that had happened the evening before; comments on the dress or appearance of the dinner contingent were exchanged in friendly confidence.

These seven lodgers were Mme. Vauquer's spoiled children. Among them she distributed, with astronomical precision, the exact proportion of respect and attention due to the varying amounts they paid for their board. One single consideration influenced all these human beings thrown together by chance. The two second-floor lodgers only paid seventy-two francs a month. Such prices as these are confined to the Faubourg Saint-Marcel and the district between La Bourbe and the Salpêtrière; and, as might be expected, poverty, more or less apparent, weighed upon them all, Mme. Couture being the sole exception to the rule.

The dreary surroundings were reflected in the costumes of the inmates of the house; all were alike threadbare. The color of the men's coats was problematical; such shoes, in more fashionable quarters, are only to be seen lying in the gutter; the cuffs and collars were worn and frayed at the edges; every limp article of clothing looked like the ghost of its former self. The women's dresses were faded, old-fashioned, dyed and re-dyed; they wore gloves that were glazed with hard wear, much-mended lace, dingy ruffles, crumpled muslin fichus. So much for their clothing; but, for the most part, their frames were solid enough; their constitutions had weathered the storms of life; their cold, hard faces were worn like coins that have been withdrawn from circulation, but there were greedy teeth behind the withered lips. Dramas brought to a close or still in progress are foreshadowed by the sight of such actors as these, not the dramas that are played before the footlights and against a background of painted canvas, but dumb dramas of life, frost-bound dramas that sear hearts like fire, dramas that do not end with the actors' lives.

Mlle. Michonneau, that elderly young lady, screened her weak eyes from the daylight by a soiled green silk shade with a rim, an object fit to scare away the Angel of Pity himself. Her shawl, with its scanty, draggled fringe, might have covered a skeleton, so meagre and angular was the form beneath it. Yet she must have been pretty and shapely once. What corrosive had destroyed the feminine outlines? Was it trouble, or vice, or greed? Had she loved too well? Had she been a second-hand clothes dealer, or merely a courtesan? Was she expiating the flaunting triumphs of a youth overcrowded with pleasures by an old age in which she was shunned by every passer-by? Her vacant gaze sent a chill through you; her shriveled face seemed like a menace. Her voice was like the shrill, thin note of the grasshopper sounding from the thicket when winter is at hand. She said that she had nursed an old gentleman, ill of catarrh of the bladder, and left to die by his children, who thought that he had nothing left. His bequest to her, a life annuity of a thousand francs, was periodically disputed by his heirs, who mingled slander with their persecutions. In spite of the ravages of conflicting passions, her face retained some traces of its former fairness and fineness of tissue, some vestiges of the physical charms of her youth still survived.

M. Poiret was a sort of automaton. He might be seen any day sailing like a gray shadow along the walks of the Jardin des Plantes, on his head a shabby cap, a cane with an old yellow ivory handle in the tips of his thin fingers; the outspread skirts of his threadbare overcoat failed to conceal his meagre figure; his breeches hung loosely on his shrunken limbs; the thin, blue-stockinged legs trembled like those of a drunken man; there was a notable breach of continuity between the dingy white waistcoat and crumpled shirt frills and the cravat twisted about a throat like a turkey gobbler's; altogether, his appearance set people wondering whether this outlandish ghost belonged to the audacious race of the sons of Japhet who flutter about on the Boulevard Italien. What kind of toil could have so shriveled him? What devouring passions had darkened that bulbous countenance, which would have seemed outrageous as a caricature? What had he been? Well, perhaps he had been part of the machinery of justice, a clerk in the office to which the executioner sends in his accounts—so much for providing black veils for parricides, so much for sawdust, so much for pulleys and cord for the knife. Or he might have been a receiver at the door of a public slaughter-house, or a sub-inspector of nuisances. Indeed, the man appeared to have been one of the beasts of burden in our great social mill; one of those Parisian Ratons who do not even know by sight their Bertrands; a pivot in the obscure machinery that disposes of misery and things unclean; one of those men, in short, at sight of whom we are prompted to remark that: "After all, we cannot do without them."

Stately Paris ignores the existence of these faces bleached by moral or physical suffering; but then Paris is in truth an ocean that no line can plumb. You may survey its surface and describe it; but no matter what pains you take with your investigations, no matter how numerous and painstaking the toilers in this sea, there will always be lonely and unexplored regions in its depths, caverns unknown, flowers and pearls and monsters of the deep overlooked or forgotten by the divers of literature. The Maison Vauquer is one of these curious monstrosities.

Two, however, of Mme. Vauquer's boarders formed a striking contrast to the rest. There was a sickly pallor, such as is often seen in anaemic girls, in Mlle. Victorine Taillefer's face; and her unvarying expression of sadness, like her embarrassed manner and pinched look, was in keeping with the general wretchedness of the establishment in the Rue Neuve-Saint-Geneviève, which forms a background to this picture; but her face was young, there was youthfulness in her voice and elasticity in her movements. This young misfortune was not unlike a shrub newly planted in an uncongenial soil, where its leaves have already begun to wither. The outlines of her figure, revealed by her dress of the simplest and cheapest materials, were also youthful. There was the same kind of charm about her too slender form, her faintly colored face and light-brown hair, that modern poets find in mediaeval statuettes; and a sweet expression, a look of Christian resignation in the dark gray eyes. She was pretty by force of contrast; if she had been happy, she would have been charming. Happiness is the poetry of woman, as the toilette is her tinsel. If the delightful excitement of a ball had made the pale face glow with color; if the delights of a luxurious life had brought the color to the wan cheeks that were slightly hollowed already; if love had put light into the sad eyes, then Victorine might have ranked among the fairest; but she lacked the two things which create woman a second time—pretty dresses and love-letters.

A book might have been made of her story. Her father was persuaded that he had sufficient reason for declining to acknowledge her, and allowed her a bare six hundred francs a year; he had further taken measures to disinherit his daughter, and had converted all his real estate into personalty, that he might leave it undivided to his son. Victorine's mother had died broken-hearted in Mme. Couture's house; and the latter, who was a near relation, had taken charge of the little orphan. Unluckily, the widow of the paymaster of the armies of the Republic had nothing in the world but her jointure and her widow's pension, and some day she might be obliged to leave the helpless, inexperienced girl to the mercy of the world. The good soul, therefore, took Victorine to mass every Sunday, and to confession once a fortnight, thinking that, in any case, she would bring up her ward to be devout. She was right; religion offered a solution of the problem of the young girl's future. The poor child loved the father who refused to acknowledge her. Once every year she tried to see him to deliver her mother's message of forgiveness, but every year hitherto she had knocked at that door in vain; her father was inexorable. Her brother, her only means of communication, had not come to see her for four years, and had sent her no assistance; yet she prayed to God to unseal her father's eyes and to soften her brother's heart, and no accusations mingled with her prayers. Mme. Couture and Mme. Vauquer exhausted the vocabulary of abuse, and failed to find words that did justice to the banker's iniquitous conduct; but while they heaped execrations on the millionaire, Victorine's words were as gentle as the moan of the wounded dove, and affection found expression even in the cry drawn from her by pain.

Eugène de Rastignac was a thoroughly southern type; he had a fair complexion, blue eyes, black hair. In his figure, manner, and his whole bearing it was easy to see that he either came of a noble family, or that, from his earliest childhood, he had been gently bred. If he was careful of his wardrobe, only taking last year's clothes into daily wear, still upon occasion he could issue forth as a young man of fashion. Ordinarily he wore a shabby coat and waistcoat, the limp black cravat, untidily knotted, that students affect, trousers that matched the rest of his costume, and boots that had been resoled.

Vautrin (the man of forty with the dyed whiskers) marked a transition stage between these two young people and the others. He was the kind of man that calls forth the remark: "He looks a jovial sort!" He had broad shoulders, a well-developed chest, muscular arms, and strong square-fisted hands; the joints of his fingers were covered with tufts of fiery red hair. His face was furrowed by premature wrinkles; there was a certain hardness about it in spite of his bland and insinuating manner. His bass voice was by no means unpleasant, and was in keeping with his boisterous laughter. He was always obliging, always in good spirits; if anything went wrong with one of the locks, he would soon unscrew it, take it to pieces, file it, oil and clean and set it in order, and put it back in its place again: "I am an old hand at it," he used to say. Not only so, he knew all about ships, the sea, France, foreign countries, men, business, law, great houses and prisons—there was nothing that he did not know. If any one complained rather more than usual, he would offer his services at once. He had several times lent money to Mme. Vauquer, or to the boarders; but, somehow, those whom he obliged felt that they would sooner face death than fail to repay him; a certain resolute look, sometimes seen on his face, inspired fear of him, for all his appearance of easy good-nature. In the way he spat there was an imperturbable coolness which seemed to indicate that this was a man who would not stick at a crime to extricate himself from a false position. His eyes, like those of a pitiless judge, seemed to go to the very bottom of all questions, to read all natures, all feelings and thoughts. His habit of life was very regular; he usually went out after breakfast, returning in time for dinner, and disappeared for the rest of the evening, letting himself in about midnight with a latchkey, a privilege that Mme. Vauquer accorded to no other boarder. But then he was on very good terms with the widow; he used to call her "mamma," and put his arm round her waist, a piece of flattery perhaps not appreciated to the full! The worthy woman might imagine this to be an easy feat; but, as a matter of fact, no arm but Vautrin's was long enough to encircle that solid circummfrence.

It was a characteristic trait of his generously to pay fifteen francs a month for the cup of coffee with a dash of brandy in it, which he took after dinner. Less superficial observers than young men engulfed by the whirlpool of Parisian life, or old men, who took no interest in anything that did not directly concern them, would not have stopped short at the vaguely unsatisfactory impression that Vautrin made upon them. He knew or guessed the concerns of every one about him; but none of them had been able to penetrate his thoughts, or to discover his occupation. He had deliberately made his apparent good-nature, his unfailing readiness to oblige, and his high spirits into a barrier between himself and the rest of them, but not seldom he gave glimpses of appalling depths of character. He seemed to delight in scourging the upper classes of society with the lash of his tongue, to take pleasure in convicting it of inconsistency, in mocking at law and order with some grim jest worthy of Juvenal, as if some grudge against the social system rankled in him, as if there were some mystery carefully hidden away in his life.

Mlle. Taillefer felt attracted, perhaps unconsciously, by the strength of the one man, and the good looks of the other; her stolen glances and secret thoughts were divided between them; but neither of them seemed to take any notice of her, although some day a chance might alter her position, and she would be a wealthy heiress. For that matter, there was not a soul in the house who took any trouble to investigate the various chronicles of misfortunes, real or imaginary, related by the rest. Each one regarded the others with indifference tempered by suspicion; it was a natural result of their relative positions. Practical assistance not one of them could give, this they all knew, and they had long since exhausted their stock of condolence over previous discussions of their grievances. They were in something of the same position as an elderly couple who have nothing left to say to each other. The routine of existence kept them in contact, but they were parts of a mechanism which wanted oil. There was not one of them but would have passed a blind man begging in the street, not one that felt moved to pity by a tale of misfortune, not one who did not see in death the solution of the all absorbing problem of misery which left them cold to the most terrible anguish in others.

The happiest of these hapless beings was certainly Mme. Vauquer, who reigned supreme over this hospital supported by voluntary contributions. For her, the little garden, which silence, and cold, and rain, and drought combined to make as dreary as an Asian steppe, was a pleasant shaded nook; the gaunt yellow house, the musty odors of a back shop had charms for her, and for her alone. Those cells belonged to her. She fed those convicts condemned to penal servitude for life, and her authority was recognized among them. Where else in Paris would they have found wholesome food in sufficient quantity at the prices she charged them, and rooms which they were at liberty to make, if not exactly elegant or comfortable, at any rate clean and healthy? If she had committed some flagrant act of injustice, the victim would have borne it in silence.

Such a gathering contained, as might have been expected, the elements out of which a complete society might be constructed. And, as in a school, as in the world itself, there was among the eighteen men and women who met round the dinner table a poor creature, despised by all the others, condemned to be the butt of all their jokes. At the beginning of Eugène de Rastignac's second twelvemonth, this figure suddenly started out into bold relief against the background of human forms and faces among which the law student was yet to live for another two years to come. This laughing-stock was the retired vermicelli merchant, Old Goriot, upon whose face a painter, like the historian, would have concentrated all the light in his picture.

How had it come about that the boarders regarded him with a half-malignant contempt? Why did they subject the oldest among their number to a kind of persecution, in which there was mingled some pity, but no respect for his misfortunes? Had he brought it upon himself by some eccentricity or absurdity, which is less easily forgiven or forgotten than more serious defects? The question strikes at the root of many a social injustice. Perhaps it is only human nature to inflict suffering on anything that will endure suffering, whether by reason of its genuine humility, or indifference, or sheer helplessness. Do we not, one and all, like to feel our strength even at the expense of someone or of something? The poorest sample of humanity, the street arab, will pull the bell handle at every street door in bitter weather, and scramble up to write his name on the unsullied marble of a monument.

In the year 1813, at the age of sixty-nine or thereabouts, "Old Goriot" had sold his business and retired—to Mme. Vauquer's boarding-house. When he first came there he had taken the rooms now occupied by Mme. Couture; he had paid twelve hundred francs a year like a man to whom five louis more or less was a mere trifle. For him Mme. Vauquer had made various improvements in the three rooms destined for his use, in consideration of a certain sum paid in advance, so it was said, for the miserable furniture, that is to say, for some yellow cotton curtains, a few chairs of stained wood covered with Utrecht velvet, several wretched colored prints in frames, and wall-papers that a little suburban tavern would have disdained. Possibly it was the careless generosity with which Old Goriot allowed himself to be overreached at this period of his life (they called him Monsieur Goriot very respectfully then) that gave Mme. Vauquer the meanest opinion of his business abilities; she looked on him as an imbecile where money was concerned.

Goriot had brought with him a considerable wardrobe, the gorgeous outfit of a retired tradesman who denies himself nothing. Mme. Vauquer's astonished eyes beheld no less than eighteen cambric-fronted shirts, the splendor of their fineness being enhanced by a pair of pins each bearing a large diamond, and connected by a short chain, an ornament which adorned the vermicelli-maker's shirt-front. He usually wore a coat of cornflower blue; his rotund and portly person was still further set off by a clean white waistcoat, and a gold chain and seals which dangled over that broad expanse. His snuff-box, likewise of gold, contained a locket which enclosed a lock of hair, suggesting pleasant adventures of the past. When his hostess accused him of being "a bit of a beau," he smiled with the vanity of a citizen whose foible is gratified. His cupboards (ormoires, as he called them in the popular dialect) were filled with a quantity of plate that he brought with him. The widow's eyes gleamed as she obligingly helped him to unpack the soup ladles, table-spoons, forks, cruet-stands, tureens, dishes, and breakfast services—all of silver, which were duly arranged upon the shelves, besides a few more or less handsome pieces of plate, all weighing no inconsiderable number of ounces; he could not bring himself to part with these gifts that reminded him of past domestic festivals.

"This was my wife's present to me on the first anniversary of our wedding day," he said to Mme. Vauquer, as he put away a little silver posset-dish, with two turtle-doves billing on the cover. "Poor dear! she spent on it all the money she had saved before we married. Do you know, I would sooner scratch the earth with my nails for a living, madame, than part with that. But I shall be able to take my coffee out of it every morning for the rest of my days, thank the Lord! I am not to be pitied. There's not much fear of my starving for some time to come."

Finally, Mme. Vauquer's magpie's eye had discovered several government bonds, and, after a rough calculation, was disposed to credit Goriot (worthy man) with something like ten thousand francs a year. From that day forward Mme. Vauquer (née de Conflans), who, as a matter of fact, had seen forty-eight summers, though she would only own to thirty-nine of them—Mme. Vauquer had her own ideas. Though Goriot's eyes seemed to have shrunk in their sockets, though they were weak and watery, owing to some glandular affection which compelled him to wipe them continually, she considered him to be a very gentlemanly and pleasant-looking man. Moreover, the widow saw favorable indications of character in the well-developed calves of his legs and in his square-shaped nose, indications still further borne out by the worthy man's full-moon countenance and look of stupid good-nature. This, in all probability, was a strongly-build animal, whose brains mostly consisted in a capacity for affection. His hair, worn in "pigeon wings", and duly powdered every morning by the barber from the école Polytechnique, described five points on his low forehead, and made an elegant setting to his face. Though his manners were somewhat boorish, he was always as neat as a new pin, and he took his snuff in a lordly way, like a man who knows that his snuff-box is always likely to be filled with maccaboy; so that when Mme. Vauquer lay down to rest on the day of M. Goriot's installation, her heart, like a larded partridge, sweltered before the fire of a burning desire to shake off the shroud of Vauquer and rise again as Goriot. She would marry again, sell her boarding-house, give her hand to this fine flower of citizenship, become a lady of consequence in the quarter, and ask for subscriptions for charitable purposes; she would make little Sunday excursions to Choisy, Soissy, Gentilly; she would have a box at the theatre when she liked, instead of waiting for the author's tickets that one of her boarders sometimes gave her, in July; the whole Eldorado of a little Parisian household rose up before Mme. Vauquer in her dreams. Nobody knew that she herself possessed forty thousand francs, accumulated sou by sou, that was her secret; surely as far as money was concerned she was a very tolerable match. "And in other respects, I am quite his equal," she said to herself, turning as if to assure herself of the charms of a form that the portly Sylvie found moulded in down feathers every morning.

For three months from that day Mme. Veuve Vauquer availed herself of the services of M. Goriot's coiffeur, and went to some expense over her toilette, expense justifiable on the ground that she owed it to herself and her establishment to pay some attention to appearances when such highly respectable persons honored her house with their presence. She expended no small amount of ingenuity in a sort of weeding process of her lodgers, announcing her intention of receiving henceforward none but people who were in every way select. If a stranger presented himself, she let him know that M. Goriot, one of the best known and most highly respected merchants in Paris, had singled out her boarding-house for a residence. She drew up a prospectus headed MAISON VAUQUER, in which it was asserted that hers was "one of the oldest and most highly recommended boarding-houses in the Latin Quarter." "From the windows of the house"—thus ran the prospectus— "there is a charming view of the Vallée des Gobelins [so there is—from the third floor], and a beautiful garden, extending down to an avenue of lindens at the further end." Mention was made of the bracing air of the place and its quiet situation.

It was this prospectus that attracted Mme. la Comtesse de l'Ambermesnil, a widow of six-and-thirty, who was awaiting the final settlement of her husband's affairs, and of another matter regarding a pension due to her as the wife of a general who had died "on the fields of battle." On this Mme. Vauquer saw to her table, lighted a fire daily in the sitting-room for nearly six months, and kept the promise of her prospectus, even going to some expense to do so. And the Countess, on her side, addressed Mme. Vauquer as "my dear," and promised her two more boarders, the Baronne de Vaumerland and the widow of a colonel, the late Comte Picquoiseau, who were about to leave a boarding-house in the Marais, where the terms were higher than at the Maison Vauquer. Both these ladies, moreover, would be very well-to-do when the people at the War Office had come to an end of their formalities. "But government departments are always so dilatory," the lady added.

After dinner the two widows went together up to Mme. Vauquer's room, and had a snug little chat over some cordial and various delicacies reserved for the mistress of the house. Mme. Vauquer's ideas as to Goriot were cordially approved by Mme. de l'Ambermesnil; it was a capital notion, which for that matter she had guessed from the very first; in her opinion the vermicelli-maker was an excellent man.

"Ah! my dear lady, such a well-preserved man of his age, as sound as my eyesight—a man who might still make a woman happy!" said the widow.

The good-natured Countess turned to the subject of Mme. Vauquer's dress, which was not in harmony with her projects. "You must put yourself on a war footing," said she.

After much serious consideration the two widows went shopping together—they purchased a hat adorned with ostrich feathers and a cap at the Palais Royal, and the Countess took her friend to the Magasin de la Petite Jeannette, where they chose a dress and a scarf. Thus equipped for the campaign, the widow looked exactly like "the ox à la mode"; but she herself was so much pleased with the improvement, as she considered it, in her appearance, that she felt that she lay under some obligation to the Countess; and, though by no means open-handed, she begged that lady to accept a hat that cost twenty francs. The fact was that she needed the Countess' services on the delicate mission of sounding Goriot; the Countess must sing her praises in his ears. Mme. de l'Ambermesnil lent herself very good-naturedly to this manoeuvre, began her operations, and succeeded in obtaining a private interview; but the overtures that she made, with a view to securing him for herself, were received with embarrassment, not to say a repulse. She left him, revolted by his coarseness.

"My angel," said she to her dear friend, "you will make nothing of that man yonder. He is absurdly suspicious, and he is a mean curmudgeon, an idiot, a fool; you would never be happy with him."

After what had passed between M. Goriot and Mme. de l'Ambermesnil, the Countess would no longer live under the same roof. She left the next day, forgot to pay for six months' board, and left behind her wardrobe, cast-off clothing to the value of five francs. Eagerly and persistently as Mme. Vauquer sought her quondam lodger, the Comtesse de l'Ambermesnil was never heard of again in Paris. The widow often talked of this deplorable business, and regretted her own too confiding disposition. As a matter of fact, she was as suspicious as a cat; but she was like many other people, who cannot trust their own kin and put themselves at the mercy of the next chance comer—an odd but common phenomenon, whose causes may readily be traced to the depths of the human heart.

Perhaps there are people who know that they have nothing more to look for from those with whom they live; they have shown the emptiness of their hearts to their housemates, and in their secret selves they are conscious that they are severely judged, and that they deserve to be judged severely; but still they feel an unconquerable craving for praises that they do not hear, or they are consumed by a desire to appear to possess, in the eyes of a new audience, the qualities which they have not, hoping to win the admiration or affection of strangers at the risk of forfeiting it again some day. Or, once more, there are other mercenary natures who never do a kindness to a friend or a relation simply because these have a claim upon them, while a service done to a stranger brings its reward to self-love. Such natures feel but little affection for those who are nearest to them; they keep their kindness for remoter circles of acquaintance, and show most to those who dwell on its utmost limits. Mme. Vauquer belonged to both these essentially mean, false, and execrable classes.

"If I had been there at the time," Vautrin would say at the end of the story, "I would have shown her up, and that misfortune would not have befallen you. I know that kind of phiz!"

Like all narrow natures, Mme. Vauquer was wont to confine her attention to events, and did not go very deeply into the causes that brought them about; she likewise preferred to throw the blame of her own mistakes on other people, so she chose to consider that the honest vermicelli-maker was responsible for her misfortune. It had opened her eyes, so she said, with regard to him. As soon as she saw that her blandishments were in vain, and that her outlay on her toilette was money thrown away, she was not slow to discover the reason of his indifference. It became plain to her at once that there was some other attraction, to use her own expression. In short, it was evident that the hope she had so fondly cherished was a baseless delusion, and that she would "never make anything out of that man yonder," in the Countess' forcible phrase. The Countess seemed to have been a judge of character. Mme. Vauquer's aversion was naturally more energetic than her friendship, for her hatred was not in proportion to her love, but to her disappointed expectations. The human heart may find here and there a resting-place short of the highest height of affection, but we seldom stop in the steep, downward slope of hatred. Still, M. Goriot was a lodger, and the widow's wounded self-love could not vent itself in an explosion of wrath; like a monk harassed by the prior of his convent, she was forced to stifle her sighs of disappointment, and to gulp down her craving for revenge. Little minds find gratification for their feelings, benevolent or otherwise, by a constant exercise of petty ingenuity. The widow employed her woman's malice to devise a system of covert persecution. She began by a course of retrenchment— various luxuries which had found their way to the table appeared there no more.

"No more gherkins, no more anchovies; they have made a fool of me!" she said to Sylvie one morning, and they returned to the old bill of fare.

The thrifty frugality necessary to those who mean to make their way in the world had become an inveterate habit of life with M. Goriot. Soup, boiled beef, and a dish of vegetables had been, and always would be, the dinner he liked best, so Mme. Vauquer found it very difficult to annoy a boarder whose tastes were so simple. He was proof against her malice, and in desperation she spoke to him and of him slightingly before the other lodgers, who began to amuse themselves at his expense, and so gratified her desire for revenge.

Towards the end of the first year the widow's suspicions had reached such a pitch that she began to wonder how it was that a retired merchant with a secure income of seven or eight thousand livres, the owner of such magnificent plate and jewelry handsome enough for a kept mistress, should be living in her house. Why should he devote so small a proportion of his money to his expenses? Until the first year was nearly at an end, Goriot had dined out once or twice every week, but these occasions came less frequently, and at last he was scarcely absent from the dinner table twice a month. It was hardly to be expected that Mme. Vauquer should regard the increased regularity of her boarder's habits with complacency, when those little excursions of his had been so much to her interest. She attributed the change not so much to a gradual diminution of fortune as to a spiteful wish to annoy his hostess. It is one of the most detestable habits of a Liliputian mind to credit other people with its own malignant pettiness.

Unluckily, towards the end of the second year, M. Goriot's conduct gave some color to the idle talk about him. He asked Mme. Vauquer to give him a room on the second floor, and to make a corresponding reduction in her charges. Apparently, such strict economy was called for, that he did without a fire all through the winter. Mme. Vauquer asked to be paid in advance, an arrangement to which M. Goriot consented, and thenceforward she spoke of him as "Old Goriot."

What had brought about this decline and fall? Conjecture was keen, but investigation was difficult. Old Goriot was not communicative; in the sham countess' phrase he was "a curmudgeon." Empty-headed people who babble about their own affairs because they have nothing else to occupy them, naturally conclude that if people say nothing of their doings it is because their doings will not bear being talked about; so the highly respectable merchant became a scoundrel, and the late beau was an old rogue. Opinion fluctuated. Sometimes, according to Vautrin, who came about this time to live in the Maison Vauquer, Old Goriot was a man who went on Change and dabbled (to use the sufficiently expressive language of the Stock Exchange) in stocks and shares after he had ruined himself by heavy speculation. Sometimes it was held that he was one of those petty gamblers who nightly play for small stakes until they win a few francs. A theory that he was a detective in the employ of the Home Office found favor at one time, but Vautrin urged that "Goriot was not sharp enough for one of that sort." There were yet other solutions; Old Goriot was a skinflint, a shark of a money-lender, a man who kept feeding the same lottery number. He was by turns all the most mysterious brood of vice and shame and misery; yet, however vile his life might be, the feeling of repulsion which he aroused in others was not so strong that he must be banished from their society—he paid his way. Besides, Goriot had his uses, every one vented his spleen or sharpened his wit on him; he was pelted with jokes and belabored with hard words. The general consensus of opinion was in favor of a theory which seemed the most likely; this was Mme. Vauquer's view. According to her, the man so well preserved at his time of life, as sound as her eyesight, with whom a woman might be very happy, was a libertine who had strange tastes. These are the facts upon which Mme. Vauquer's slanders were based.

Early one morning, some few months after the departure of the unlucky Countess who had managed to live for six months at the widow's expense, Mme. Vauquer (not yet dressed) heard the rustle of a silk dress and a young woman's light footstep on the stair; someone was going to Goriot's room. He seemed to expect the visit, for his door stood ajar. The portly Sylvie presently came up to tell her mistress that a girl too pretty to be honest, "dressed like a goddess," and not a speck of mud on her laced cashmere boots, had glided in from the street like a snake, had found the kitchen, and asked for M. Goriot's room. Mme. Vauquer and the cook, listening, overheard several words affectionately spoken during the visit, which lasted for some time. When M. Goriot went downstairs with the lady, the stout Sylvie forthwith took her basket and followed the lover-like couple, under pretext of going to do her marketing.

"M. Goriot must be awfully rich, all the same, madame," she reported on her return, "to keep her in such style. Just imagine it! There was a splendid carriage waiting at the corner of the Place de l'Estrapade, and she got into it."

While they were at dinner that evening, Mme. Vauquer went to the window and drew the curtain, as the sun was shining into Goriot's eyes.

"You are beloved of fair ladies, M. Goriot—the sun seeks you out," she said, alluding to his visitor. "Peste! you have good taste; she was very pretty."

"That was my daughter," he said, with a kind of pride in his voice, and the rest chose to consider this as the fatuity of an old man who wishes to save appearances.

A month after this visit M. Goriot received another. The same daughter who had come to see him that morning came again after dinner, this time in evening dress. The boarders, in deep discussion in the dining-room, caught a glimpse of a lovely, fair-haired woman, slender, graceful, and much too distinguished-looking to be a daughter of Old Goriot's.

"Two of them!" cried the portly Sylvie, who did not recognize the lady of the first visit.

A few days later, and another young lady—a tall, well-moulded brunette, with dark hair and bright eyes—came to ask for M. Goriot.

"Three of them!" said Sylvie.

Then the second daughter, who had first come in the morning to see her father, came shortly afterwards in the evening. She wore a ball dress, and came in a carriage.

"Four of them!" commented Mme. Vauquer and her plump maid. Sylvie saw not a trace of resemblance between this great lady and the girl in her simple morning dress who had entered her kitchen on the occasion of her first visit.

At that time Goriot was paying twelve hundred francs a year to his landlady, and Mme. Vauquer saw nothing out of the common in the fact that a rich man had four or five mistresses; nay, she thought it very knowing of him to pass them off as his daughters. She was not at all inclined to draw a hard-and-fast line, or to take umbrage at his sending for them to the Maison Vauquer; yet, inasmuch as these visits explained her boarder's indifference to her, she went so far (at the end of the second year) as to speak of him as an "ugly old wretch." When at length her boarder declined to nine hundred francs a year, she asked him very insolently what he took her house to be, after meeting one of these ladies on the stairs. Old Goriot answered that the lady was his eldest daughter.

"So you have two or three dozen daughters, have you?" said Mme. Vauquer sharply.

"I have only two," her boarder answered meekly, like a ruined man who is broken in to all the cruel usage of misfortune.





Towards the end of the third year Old Goriot reduced his expenses still further; he went up to the third story, and now paid forty-five francs a month. He did without snuff, told his hairdresser that he no longer required his services, and gave up wearing powder. When Goriot appeared for the first time in this condition, an exclamation of astonishment broke from his hostess at the color of his hair—a dingy olive gray. He had grown sadder day by day under the influence of some hidden trouble; among all the faces round the table, his was the most woe-begone. There was no longer any doubt. Goriot was an elderly libertine, whose eyes had only been preserved by the skill of the physician from the malign influence of the remedies necessitated by the state of his health. The disgusting color of his hair was a result of his excesses and of the drugs which he had taken that he might continue his career. The poor old man's mental and physical condition afforded some grounds for the absurd rubbish talked about him. When his outfit was worn out, he replaced the fine linen by calico at fourteen sous the ell. His diamonds, his gold snuff-box, watch-chain, and trinkets disappeared one by one. He had left off wearing the cornflower-blue coat, and was sumptuously arrayed, summer as winter, in a coarse chestnut-brown coat, a plush waistcoat, and doeskin breeches. He grew thinner and thinner; his legs were shrunken, his cheeks, once so puffed out by contented bourgeois prosperity, were covered with wrinkles, and the outlines of the jawbones were distinctly visible; there were deep furrows in his forehead. In the fourth year of his residence in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève he was no longer like his former self. The hale vermicelli manufacturer, sixty-two years of age, who had looked scarce forty, the stout, comfortable, prosperous tradesman, with an almost bucolic air, and such a brisk demeanor that it did you good to look at him; the man with something boyish in his smile, had suddenly sunk into his dotage, and had become a feeble, vacillating septuagenarian.

The keen, bright blue eyes had grown dull, and faded to a steel-gray color; the red inflamed rims looked as though they had shed tears of blood. He excited feelings of repulsion in some, and of pity in others. The young medical students who came to the house noticed the drooping of his lower lip and the conformation of the facial angle; and, after teasing him for some time to no purpose, they declared that cretinism was setting in.

One evening after dinner Mme. Vauquer said half banteringly to him, "So those daughters of yours don't come to see you any more, eh?" meaning to imply her doubts as to his paternity; but Old Goriot shrank as if his hostess had touched him with a sword point.

"They come sometimes," he said in a tremulous voice.

"Aha! you still see them sometimes?" cried the students. "Bravo, Old Goriot!"

The old man scarcely seemed to hear the witticisms at his expense that followed on the words; he had relapsed into the dreamy state of mind that these superficial observers took for senile torpor, due to his lack of intelligence. If they had only known, they might have been deeply interested by the problem of his condition; but few problems were more obscure. It was easy, of course, to find out whether Goriot had really been a vermicelli manufacturer; the amount of his fortune was readily discoverable; but the old people, who were most inquisitive as to his concerns, never went beyond the limits of the Quarter, and lived in the lodging-house much as oysters cling to a rock. As for the rest, the current of life in Paris daily awaited them, and swept them away with it; so soon as they left the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève, they forgot the existence of the old man, whom they mocked at dinner. For those narrow souls, or for careless youth, the misery in Old Goriot's withered face and its dull apathy were quite incompatible with wealth or any sort of intelligence. As for the creatures whom he called his daughters, all Mme. Vauquer's boarders were of her opinion. With the faculty for severe logic sedulously cultivated by elderly women during long evenings of gossip till they can always find an hypothesis to fit all circumstances, she was wont to reason thus:

"If Old Goriot had daughters of his own as rich as those ladies who came here seemed to be, he would not be lodging in my house, on the third floor, at forty-five francs a month; and he would not go about dressed like a poor man."

No objection could be raised to these inferences. So by the end of the month of November 1819, at the time when the curtain rises on this drama, every one in the house had come to have a very decided opinion as to the poor old man. He had never had either wife or daughter; excesses had reduced him to this sluggish condition; he was a sort of human mollusk who should be classed among the capulidae, so said one of the dinner contingent, an employe at the Museum, who had a pretty wit of his own. Poiret was an eagle, a gentleman, compared with Goriot. Poiret would join the talk, argue, answer when he was spoken to; as a matter of fact, his talk, arguments, and responses contributed nothing to the conversation, for Poiret had a habit of repeating what the others said in different words; still, he did join in the talk; he was alive, and seemed capable of feeling; while Old Goriot (to quote the Museum official again) was invariably at zero—Réaumur.

Eugène de Rastignac had just returned to Paris in a state of mind not unknown to young men who are conscious of unusual powers, and to those whose faculties are so stimulated by a difficult position, that for the time being they rise above the ordinary level.

Rastignac's first year of study for the preliminary examinations in law had left him free to see the sights of Paris and to enjoy some of its amusements. A student has not much time on his hands if he sets himself to learn the repertory of every theatre, and to study the ins and outs of the labyrinth of Paris. To know its customs; to learn the language, and become familiar with the amusements of the capital, he must explore its recesses, good and bad, follow the studies that please him best, and form some idea of the treasures contained in galleries and museums.

At this stage of his career a student grows eager and excited about all sorts of follies that seem to him to be of immense importance. He has his hero, his great man, a professor at the Collège de France, paid to talk down to the level of his audience. He adjusts his cravat, and strikes various attitudes for the benefit of the women in the first galleries at the Opéra-Comique. As he passes through all these successive initiations, and breaks out of his sheath, the horizons of life widen around him, and at length he grasps the plan of society with the different human strata of which it is composed.

If he begins by admiring the procession of carriages on sunny afternoons in the Champs-Elysées, he soon reaches the further stage of envying their owners. Unconsciously, Eugène had served his apprenticeship before he went back to Angoulême for the long vacation after taking his degrees as bachelor of arts and bachelor of law. The illusions of childhood had vanished, so also had the ideas he brought with him from the provinces; he had returned thither with an intelligence developed, with loftier ambitions, and saw things as they were at home in the old manor house. His father and mother, his two brothers and two sisters, with an aged aunt, whose whole fortune consisted in annuities, lived on the little estate of Rastignac. The whole property brought in about three thousand francs; and though the amount varied with the season (as must always be the case in a vine-growing district), they were obliged to spare an unvarying twelve hundred francs out of their income for him. He saw how constantly the poverty, which they had generously hidden from him, weighed upon them; he could not help comparing the sisters, who had seemed so beautiful to his boyish eyes, with women in Paris, who had realized the beauty of his dreams. The uncertain future of the whole family depended upon him. It did not escape his eyes that not a crumb was wasted in the house, nor that the wine they drank was made from the second pressing; a multitude of small things, which it is useless to speak of in detail here, made him burn to distinguish himself, and his ambition to succeed increased tenfold.

He meant, like all great souls, that his success should be owing entirely to his merits; but his was pre-eminently a southern temperament, the execution of his plans was sure to be marred by the hesitancy that seizes on youth when youth sees itself alone in a wide sea, uncertain how to spend its energies, whither to steer its course, how to adapt its sails to the winds. At first he determined to fling himself heart and soul into his work, but he was diverted from this purpose by the need of establishing the most useful social connections; then he saw how great an influence women exert in social life, and suddenly made up his mind to go out into this world to seek a protectress there. Surely a clever and high-spirited young man, whose wit and courage were set off to advantage by a graceful figure and the vigorous kind of beauty that readily strikes a woman's imagination, need not despair of finding a protectress. These ideas occurred to him in his country walks with his sisters, whom he had once joined so gaily. The girls thought him very much changed.

His aunt, Mme. de Marcillac, had been presented at court, and had moved among the aristocratic heights of that lofty region. Suddenly the young man's ambition discerned in those recollections of hers, which had been like nursery fairy tales to her nephews and nieces, the elements of a social success at least as important as the success which he had achieved at the Law School. He began to ask his aunt about those relations; some of the old ties might still hold good. After much shaking of the branches of the family tree, the old lady came to the conclusion that of all persons who could be useful to her nephew among the selfish tribe of rich relations, the Vicomtesse de Beauséant was the least likely to refuse. To this lady, therefore, she wrote in the old-fashioned style, recommending Eugène to her; pointing out to her nephew that if he succeeded in pleasing Mme. de Beauséant, the Vicomtesse would introduce him to other relations. A few days after his return to Paris, therefore, Rastignac sent his aunt's letter to Mme. de Beauséant. The Vicomtesse replied by an invitation to a ball for the following evening. This was the position of affairs at the Maison Vauquer at the end of November 1819.

A few days later, after Mme. de Beauséant's ball, Eugène came in at two o'clock in the morning. The persevering student meant to make up for the lost time by working until daylight. It was the first time that he had attempted to spend the night in this way in that silent quarter. The spell of a factitious energy was upon him; he had beheld the pomp and splendor of the world. He had not dined at the Maison Vauquer; the boarders probably would think that he would walk home at daybreak from the dance, as he had done sometimes on former occasions, after an evening at the Prado or a ball at the Odéon, splashing his silk stockings thereby, and ruining his pumps.

It so happened that Christophe took a look into the street before drawing the bolts of the door; and Rastignac, coming in at that moment, could go up to his room without making any noise, followed by Christophe, who made a great deal. Eugène exchanged his dress suit for a shabby overcoat and slippers, kindled a fire with some blocks of patent fuel, and prepared for his night's work in such a sort that the faint sounds he made were drowned by Christophe's heavy tramp on the stairs.

Eugène sat absorbed in thought for a few moments before plunging into his law books. He had just become aware of the fact that the Vicomtesse de Beauséant was one of the queens of fashion, that her house was thought to be the pleasantest in the Faubourg Saint-Germain. And not only so, she was, by right of her fortune and the name she bore, one of the most conspicuous figures in that aristocratic world. Thanks to his aunt, thanks to Mme. de Marcillac's letter of introduction, the poor student had been kindly received in that house before he knew the extent of the favor thus shown to him. It was almost like a patent of nobility to be admitted to those gilded salons; he had appeared in the most exclusive circle in Paris, and now all doors were open for him. Eugène had been dazzled at first by the brilliant assembly, and had scarcely exchanged a few words with the Vicomtesse; he had been content to single out a goddess from among this throng of Parisian divinities, one of those women who are sure to attract a young man's fancy.

The Comtesse Anastasie de Restaud was tall and gracefully made; she had one of the prettiest figures in Paris. Imagine a pair of great dark eyes, a magnificently moulded hand, a shapely foot. There was a fiery energy in her movements; the Marquis de Ronquerolles had called her "a thoroughbred," but this fineness of nervous orgainization had brought no allompanying defect; the outlines of her form were full and rounded, without any tendency to stontness. "A thoroughbred," "a pure pedigree," these figures of speech have replaced the "heavenly angel" and Ossianic nomenclature; the old mythology of love is extinct, doomed to perish by modern dandyism. But for Rastignac, Mme. Anastasie de Restaud was the woman for whom he had sighed. He had contrived to write his name twice upon the list of partners upon her fan, and had snatched a few words with her during the first quadrille.

"Where shall I meet you again, Madame?" he asked abruptly, and the tones of his voice were full of the vehement energy that women like so well.

"Oh, everywhere!" said she, "in the Bois, at the Bouffons, in my own house."

With the impetuosity of his adventurous southern temper, he did all he could to cultivate an acquaintance with this lovely countess, making the best of his opportunities in the quadrille and during a waltz that she gave him. When he had told her that he was a cousin of Mme. de Beauséant's, the Countess, whom he took for a great lady, asked him to call at her house, and after her parting smile, Rastignac felt convinced that he must make this visit. He was so lucky as to light upon someone who did not laugh at his ignorance, a fatal defect among the gilded and insolent youth of that period; the coterie of Maulincourts, Maxime de Trailles, de Marsays, Ronquerolles, Ajuda-Pintos, and Vandenesses who shone there in all the glory of fatuous complacency among the best-dressed women of fashion in Paris—Lady Brandon, the Duchesse de Langeais, the Comtesse de Kergarouët, Mme. de Sérisy, the Duchesse de Carigliano, the Comtesse Férraud, Mme. de Lanty, the Marquise d'Aiglemont, Mme. Firmiani, the Marquise de Listomère and the Marquise d'Espard, the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse and the Grandlieus. Luckily, therefore, for him, the novice happened upon the Marquis de Montriveau, the lover of the Duchesse de Langeais, a general as simple as a child; from him Rastignac learned that the Comtesse lived in the Rue du Helder.

Ah, what it is to be young, eager to see the world, greedily on the watch for any chance that brings you nearer the woman of your dreams, and behold two houses open their doors to you! To set foot in the Vicomtesse de Beauséant's house in the Faubourg Saint-Germain; to fall on your knees before a Comtesse de Restaud in the Chaussée d'Antin; to look at one glance across a vista of Paris drawing-rooms, conscious that, possessing sufficient good looks, you may hope to find aid and protection there in a feminine heart! To feel ambitious enough to spurn the tight-rope on which you must walk with the steady head of an acrobat for whom a fall is impossible, and to find in a charming woman the best of all balancing poles.

He sat there with his thoughts for a while, Law on the one hand, and Poverty on the other, beholding a radiant vision of a woman rise above the dull, smouldering fire. Who would not have paused and questioned the future as Eugène was doing? who would not have pictured it full of success? His wondering thoughts took wings; he was transported out of the present into that blissful future; he was sitting by Mme. de Restaud's side, when a sort of sigh, like the grunt of an overburdened St. Joseph, broke the silence of the night. It vibrated through the student, who took the sound for a death groan. He opened his door noiselessly, went out upon the landing, and saw a thin streak of light under Old Goriot's door. Eugène feared that his neighbor had been taken ill; he went over and looked through the keyhole; the old man was busily engaged in an occupation so singular and so suspicious that Rastignac thought he was only doing a piece of necessary service to society to watch the self-styled vermicelli-maker's nocturnal industries.

The table was upturned, and Goriot had doubtless in some way secured a silver plate and cup to the bar before knotting a thick rope round them; he was pulling at this rope with such enormous force that they were being crushed and twisted out of shape; to all appearance he meant to convert the richly wrought metal into ingots.

"Gad! what a man!" said Rastignac, as he watched Goriot's muscular arms; there was not a sound in the room while the old man, with the aid of the rope, was kneading the silver like dough. "Was he then, indeed, a thief, or a receiver of stolen goods, who affected imbecility and decrepitude, and lived like a beggar that he might carry on his pursuits the more securely?" Eugène stood for a moment revolving these questions, then he looked again through the keyhole.

Old Goriot had unwound his coil of rope; he had covered the table with a blanket, and was now employed in rolling the flattened mass of silver into a bar, an operation which he performed with marvelous dexterity.

"Why, he must be as strong as Augustus, King of Poland!" said Eugène to himself when the bar was nearly finished.

Old Goriot looked sadly at his handiwork, tears fell from his eyes, he blew out the dip which had served him for a light while he manipulated the silver, and Eugène heard him sigh as he lay down again.

"He is mad," thought the student.

"Poor child!" Old Goriot said aloud. Rastignac, hearing those words, concluded to keep silence; he would not hastily condemn his neighbor. He was just in the doorway of his room when a strange sound from the staircase below reached his ears; it might have been made by two men coming up in list slippers. Eugène listened; two men there certainly were, he could hear their breathing. Yet there had been no sound of opening the street door, no footsteps in the passage. Suddenly, too, he saw a faint gleam of light on the second story; it came from M. Vautrin's room.

"There are a good many mysteries here for a lodging-house!" he said to himself.

He went part of the way downstairs and listened again. The rattle of gold reached his ears. In another moment the light was put out, and again he distinctly heard the breathing of two men, but no sound of a door being opened or shut. The two men went downstairs, the faint sounds growing fainter as they went.

"Who is there?" cried Mme. Vauquer out of her bedroom window.

"I, Mme. Vauquer," answered Vautrin's deep bass voice. "I am coming in."

"That is odd! Christophe drew the bolts," said Eugène, going back to his room. "You have to sit up at night, it seems, if you really mean to know all that is going on about you in Paris."

These incidents turned his thought from his ambitious dreams; he betook himself to his work, but his thought wandered back to Old Goriot's suspicious occupation; Mme. de Restaud's face swam again and again before his eyes like a vision of a brilliant future; and at last he lay down and slept with clenched fists. When a young man makes up his mind that he will work all night, the chances are that seven times out of ten he will sleep till morning. Such vigils do not begin before we are turned twenty.

The next morning Paris was wrapped in one of the dense fogs that throw the most punctual people out in their calculations as to the time; even the most business-like folk fail to keep their appointments in such weather, and ordinary mortals wake up at noon and fancy it is eight o'clock. On this morning it was half-past nine, and Mme. Vauquer still lay abed. Christophe was late, Sylvie was late, but the two sat comfortably taking their coffee as usual. It was Sylvie's custom to take the cream off the milk destined for the boarders' breakfast for her own, and to boil the remainder for some time, so that Madame should not discover this illegal exaction.

"Sylvie," said Christophe, as he dipped a piece of toast into the coffee,"M. Vautrin, who is not such a bad sort, all the same, had two people come to see him again last night. If Madame says anything, mind you know nothing about it."

"Has he given you something?"

"He gave me a five-franc piece this month, which is as good as saying, ‘Hold your tongue.'"

"Except him and Mme. Couture, who doesn't look twice at every penny, there's no one in the house that doesn't try to get back with the left hand all that they give with the right at New Year," said Sylvie.

"And, after all," said Christophe, "what do they give you? A miserable five-franc piece. There is Old Goriot, who has cleaned his shoes himself these two years past. There is that old beggar Poiret, who goes without blacking altogether; he would sooner drink it than put it on his boots. Then there is that whipper-snapper of a student, who gives me a couple of francs. Two francs will not pay for my brushes, and he sells his old clothes, and gets more for them than they are worth. What a hole this is!"

"Pooh!" said Sylvie, sipping her coffee, "our places are the best in the Quarter, that I know. But about that great big chap Vautrin, Christophe; has any one told you anything about him?"

"Yes. I met a gentleman in the street a few days ago; he said to me, 'There's a gentleman at your place, isn't there—a tall man that dyes his whiskers?' I told him: ‘No, sir; they aren't dyed. A gay fellow like him hasn't the time to do it.' And when I told M. Vautrin about it afterwards, he said, 'Quite right, my boy. That is the way to answer them. There is nothing more disagreeable than to have your little weaknesses known; it might spoil many a match.'"

"Well, and for my part," said Sylvie, "a man tried to kid me at the market wanting to know if I had seen him put on his shirt. Such bosh! There," she cried, interrupting herself, "that's a quarter to ten striking at the Val-de-Grâce, and not a soul stirring!"

"Pooh! they are all gone out. Mme. Couture and the girl went out at eight o'clock to take the wafer at Saint-étienne. Old Goriot started off somewhere with a parcel, and the student won't be back from his lecture till ten o'clock. I saw them go while I was sweeping the stairs; Old Goriot knocked up against me, and his parcel was as hard as iron. What is the old fellow up to, I wonder? The rest of them spin him around like a top; they can never let him alone; but he is a good man, all the same, and worth more than all of them put together. He doesn't give you much himself, but he sometimes sends you with a message to ladies who fork out handsome tips; they are dressed pretty grand, too."

"His daughters, as he calls them, eh? There are a dozen of them."

"I have never been to more than two—the two who came here."

"There is Madame moving overhead; I shall have to go, or she will raise a fine racket. Just keep an eye on the milk, Christophe; don't let the cat get at it."

Sylvie went up to her mistress's room.

"Sylvie! How is this? It's nearly ten o'clock, and you let me sleep on like a dormouse! Such a thing has never happened before."

"It's the fog; it is that thick, you could cut it with a knife."

"But how about breakfast?"

"Bah! the boarders are crazy, I'm sure. They all cleared out before there was a wink of daylight."

"Do speak properly, Sylvie," Mme. Vauquer retorted; "say a blink of daylight."

"Ah, well, madame, whichever you please. Anyhow, you can have breakfast at ten o'clock. La Michonnette and Poireau have neither of them stirred. There are only those two upstairs, and they are sleeping like the logs they are."

"But, Sylvie, you put them together as if—"

"As if what?" said Sylvie, bursting into a guffaw. "The two of them make a pair."

"It is a strange thing, isn't it, Sylvie, how M. Vautrin got in last night after Christophe had bolted the door?"

"Not at all, madame. Christophe heard M. Vautrin, and went down and undid the door for him. And here are you imagining that—"

"Give me my bodice, and be quick and get breakfast ready. Dish up the rest of the mutton with the potatoes, and you can put the stewed pears on the table, those at five a penny."

A few moments later Mme. Vauquer came down, just in time to see the cat knock down a plate that covered a bowl of milk, and begin to lap in all haste.

"Mistigris!" she cried.

The cat fled, but promptly returned to rub against her ankles.

"Oh! yes, you can wheedle, you old hypocrite!" she said. "Sylvie! Sylvie!"

"Yes, madame; what is it?"

"Just see what the cat has done!"

"It is all that stupid Christophe's fault. I told him to stop and lay the table. What has become of him? Don't you worry, madame; Old Goriot shall have it. I will fill it up with water, and he won't know the difference; he never notices anything, not even what he eats."

"I wonder where the old heathen can have gone?" said Mme. Vauquer, setting the plates round the table.

"Who knows? He is up to all sorts of tricks."

"I have overslept," said Mme. Vauquer.

"But madame looks as fresh as a rose, all the same."

The door bell rang at that moment, and Vautrin came through the sitting-room, singing loudly:


"'Tis the same old story everywhere,

　　A roving heart and a roving glance...



"Oh! Mamma Vauquer! good-morning!" he cried at the sight of his hostess, and he put his arm gaily round her waist.

"There! have done—"

"'Impertinence!' Say it!" he answered. "Come, say it! Now, isn't that what you really mean? Stop a bit, I will help you to set the table. Ah! I am a nice man, am I not?


"For the locks of brown and the golden hair

　　A sighing lover...



"Oh! I have just seen something so funny—


...led by chance."



"What?" asked the widow.

"Old Goriot in the goldsmith's shop in the Rue Dauphine at half-past eight this morning. They buy old spoons and forks and gold lace there, and Goriot sold a piece of silver plate for a good round sum. It had been twisted out of shape very neatly for a man that's not used to the trade."

"Really? You don't say so?"

"Yes. One of my friends is leaving town; I had been to see him off on the Royal Mail, and was coming back here. I waited after that to see what Old Goriot would do; it is a comical affair. He came back to this quarter of the world, to the Rue des Grès, and went into a money-lender's house; everybody knows him, Gobseck, a stuck-up rascal, that would make dominoes out of his father's bones; a Jew, an Arab, a Greek, a gipsy; it would be a difficult matter to rob him, for he puts all his coin into the bank."

"Then what was Old Goriot doing there?"

"Doing?" said Vautrin. "Nothing; he was bent on his own undoing. He is a simpleton, stupid enough to ruin himself by running after women who—"

"There he is!" said Sylvie.

"Christophe," cried Old Goriot's voice, "come upstairs with me."

Christophe went up, and shortly afterwards came down again.

"Where are you going?" Mme. Vauquer asked of her servant.

"Out on an errand for M. Goriot."

"What may that be?" said Vautrin, pouncing on a letter in Christophe's hand. "Mme. la Comtesse Anastasie de Restaud," he read. "Where are you going with it?" he added, as he gave the letter back to Christophe.

"To the Rue du Helder. I have orders to give this into her hands myself."

"What is there inside it?" said Vautrin, holding the letter up to the light. "A banknote? No." He peered into the envelope. "A receipted account!" he cried. "My word! 'tis a gallant old dotard. Off with you, old devil," he said, bringing down a hand on Christophe's head, and spinning the man round like a thimble; "you will have a fine tip."

By this time the table was set. Sylvie was boiling the milk, Mme. Vauquer was lighting a fire in the stove with some assistance from Vautrin, who kept on humming to himself:


"The same old story everywhere,

　　A roving heart and a roving glance."



When everything was ready, Mme. Couture and Mlle. Taillefer came in.

"Where have you been this morning, fair lady?" said Mme. Vauquer, turning to Mme. Couture.

"We have just been to say our prayers at Saint-étienne du Mont. Today is the day when we must go to see M. Taillefer. Poor little thing! She is trembling like a leaf," Mme. Couture went on, as she seated herself before the fire and held the steaming soles of her boots to the blaze.

"Warm yourself, Victorine," said Mme. Vauquer.

"It is quite right and proper, mademoiselle, to pray to Heaven to soften your father's heart," said Vautrin, as he drew a chair nearer to the orphan girl; "but that is not enough. What you want is a friend who will give the monster a piece of his mind; a barbarian that has three millions (so they say), and will not give you a dowry; and a pretty girl needs a dowry nowadays."

"Poor child!" said Mme. Vauquer. "Never mind, my pet, your wretch of a father is going just the way to bring trouble upon himself."

Victorine's eyes filled with tears at the words, and the widow checked herself at a sign from Mme. Couture.

"If we could only see him!" said the paymaster's widow; "if I could speak to him myself and give him his wife's last letter! I have never dared to run the risk of sending it by post; he knows my handwriting—"

"‘Oh woman, persecuted and injured innocent!'" exclaimed Vautrin, breaking in upon her. "So that is how you are, is it? In a few days' time I will look into your affairs, and it will be all right, you shall see."

"Oh! sir," said Victorine, with a tearful but eager glance at Vautrin, who showed no sign of being touched by it, "if you know of any way of communicating with my father, please be sure and tell him that his affection and my mother's honor are more to me than all the money in the world. If you can induce him to relent a little towards me, I will pray to God for you. You may be sure of my gratitude—"

"The same old story everywhere," sang Vautrin, with a satirical intonation. At this juncture, Goriot, Mlle. Michonneau, and Poiret came downstairs together; possibly the scent of the gravy which Sylvie was making to serve with the mutton had announced breakfast. The seven people thus assembled bade each other good morning, and took their places at the table; the clock struck ten, and the student's footstep was heard outside.

"Ah! here you are, M. Eugène," said Sylvie; "every one is breakfasting at home today."

The student exchanged greetings with the lodgers, and sat down beside Goriot.

"I have just met with a queer adventure," he said, as he helped himself abundantly to the mutton, and cut a slice of bread, which Mme. Vauquer's eyes gauged as usual.

"An adventure?" queried Poiret.

"Well, and what is there to astonish you in that, old boy?" Vautrin asked of Poiret. "M. Eugène is cut out for that kind of thing."

Mlle. Taillefer stole a timid glance at the young student.

"Tell us about your adventure!" demanded Mme. Vanquer.

"Yesterday evening I went to a ball given by a cousin of mine, the Vicomtesse de Beauséant. She has a magnificent house; the rooms were hung with silk—in short, it was a splendid affair, and I was as happy as a king——-"

"Fisher," put in Vautrin, interrupting.

"What do you mean, sir?" said Eugène sharply.

"I said ‘fisher,' because kingfishers see a good deal more fun than kings."

"Quite true; I would much rather be the little careless bird than a king," said Poiret the ditto-ist, "because—"

"In fact"—the law-student cut him short— "I danced with one of the handsomest women in the room, a charming countess, the most exquisite creature I have ever seen. There was peach blossom in her hair, and she had the loveliest bouquet of flowers—real flowers, that scented the air—but there! it is no use trying to describe a woman glowing with the dance. You ought to have seen her! Well, and this morning I met this divine countess about nine o'clock, on foot in the Rue de Gres. Oh! how my heart beat! I began to think—"

"That she was coming here," said Vautrin, with a keen look at the student. "I expect that she was going to call on old Gobseck, a money-lender. If ever you explore a Parisian woman's heart, you will find the money-lender first, and the lover afterwards. Your countess is called Anastasie de Restaud, and she lives in the Rue du Helder."

The student stared hard at Vautrin. Old Goriot raised his head at the words, and gave the two speakers a glance so full of intelligence and uneasiness that the lodgers beheld him with astonishment.

"Then Christophe was too late, and she must have gone to him!" cried Goriot, with anguish in his voice.

"It is just as I guessed," said Vautrin, leaning over to whisper in Mme. Vauquer's ear.

Goriot went on with his breakfast, but seemed unconscious of what he was doing. He had never looked more stupid nor more taken up with his own thoughts than he did at that moment.

"Who the devil could have told you her name, M. Vautrin?" asked Eugène.

"Aha! there you are!" answered Vautrin. "Papa Goriot there knew it quite well! and why should I not know it too?"

"M. Goriot?" the student cried.

"What is it?" asked the old man. "So she was very beautiful, was she, yesterday night?"

"Who?"

"Mme. de Restaud."

"Look at the old wretch," said Mme. Vauquer, speaking to Vautrin; "how his eyes light up!"

"Then does he really keep her?" said Mlle. Michonneau, in a whisper per to the student.

"Oh! yes, she was damnably pretty," Eugène answered. Old Goriot watched him with eager eyes. "If Mme. de Beauséant had not been there, my divine countess would have been the queen of the ball; none of the younger men had eyes for any one else. I was the twelfth on her list, and she danced every quadrille. The other women were furious. She must have enjoyed herself, if ever creature did! It is a true saying that there is no more beautiful sight than a frigate in full sail, a galloping horse, or a woman dancing."

"So the wheel turns," said Vautrin; "yesterday night at a duchess' ball, this morning in a money-lender's office, on the lowest rung of the ladder— just like a Parisienne! If their husbands cannot afford to pay for their frantic extravagance, they will sell themselves. Or if they cannot do that, they will tear out their mothers' hearts to find something to pay for their splendor. They will turn the world upside down. Just a Parisienne through and through!"

Old Goriot's face, which had shone at the student's words like the sun on a bright day, clouded over all at once at this cruel speech of Vautrin's.

"Well," said Mme. Vauquer, "but where is your adventure? Did you speak to her? Did you ask her if she wanted to study law?"

"She did not see me," said Eugène. "But only think of meeting one of the prettiest women in Paris in the Rue des Grès at nine o'clock! She could not have reached home after the ball till two o'clock this morning. Wasn't it queer? There is no place like Paris for this sort of adventures."

"Pshaw! much funnier things than that happen here!" exclaimed Vautrin.

Mlle. Taillefer had scarcely heeded the talk, she was so absorbed by the thought of the new attempt that she was about to make. Mme. Couture made a sign that it was time to go upstairs and dress; the two ladies went out, and Old Goriot followed their example.

"Well, did you see?" said Mme. Vauquer, addressing Vautrin and the rest of the circle. "He is ruining himself for those women, that is plain."

"Nothing will ever make me believe that that beautiful Comtesse de Restaud is being kept by Old Goriot," cried the student.

"Well, and if you don't," broke in Vautrin, "we are not set on convincing you. You are too young to know Paris thoroughly yet; later on you will find out that there are what we call men with certain passions—"

Mlle. Michonneau gave Vautrin an intelligent glance at these words. It was like an old war hores who had just heard his regimental bugle. "Aha!" said Vautrin, stopping in his speech to give her a searching glance, "so we have had our little experiences, have we?"

The old maid lowered her eyes like a nun who sees a statue.

"Well," he went on, "when folk of that kind get a notion into their heads, they cannot drop it. They must drink the water from some particular spring— it is stagnant as often as not; but they will sell their wives and families, they will sell their own souls to the devil to get it. For some this spring is play, or the Stock Exchange, or music, or a collection of pictures or insects; for others it is some woman who can give them the dainties they like. You might offer these last all the women on earth—they would turn up their noses; they will have the only one who can gratify their passion. It often happens that the woman does not care for them at all, and treats them cruelly; they buy their morsels of satisfaction very dear; but no matter, the fools are never tired of it; they will take their last blanket to the pawnbroker's to give their last five-franc piece to her. Old Goriot here is one of that sort. He is discreet, so the Countess exploits him—just the way of the gay world. The poor old fellow thinks of her and of nothing else. In all other respects you see he is a stupid animal; but get him on that subject, and his eyes sparkle like diamonds. That secret is not difficult to guess. He took some plate himself this morning to the melting-pot, and I saw him at Daddy Gobseck's in the Rue des Grès. And now, mark what follows—he came back here, and gave a letter for the Comtesse de Restaud to that noodle of a Christophe, who showed us the address; there was a receipted bill inside it. It is clear that it was an urgent matter if the Countess also went herself to the old money lender. Old Goriot has financed her handsomely. There is no need to tack a tale together; the thing is self-evident. So that shows you, sir student, that all the time your Countess was smiling, dancing, flirting, swaying her peach-flower-crowned head, with her gown gathered into her hand, her slippers were pinching her, as they say; she was thinking of her protested bills, or her lover's protested bills."

"You have made me wild to know the truth," cried Eugène; "I will go to call on Mme. de Restaud to-morrow."

"Yes," echoed Poiret; "you must go and call on Mme. de Restaud."

"And perhaps you will find Old Father Goriot there, who will take payment for the assistance he politely rendered."

Eugène looked disgusted. "Why, then, this Paris of yours is a slough."

"And an uncommonly queer slough, too," replied Vautrin. "The mud splashes you as you drive through it in your carriage—you are a respectable person; you go afoot and are splashed—you are a scoundrel. You are so unlucky as to walk off with something or other belonging to somebody else, and they exhibit you as a curiosity in the Place du Palais-de-Justice; you steal a million, and you are pointed out in every salon as a model of virtue. And you pay thirty millions for the police and the courts of justice, for the maintenance of law and order! A pretty slate of things it is!"

"What," cried Mme. Vauquer, "has Old Goriot really melted down his silver posset-dish?"

"There were two turtle-doves on the lid, were there not?" asked Eugène.

"Yes, that there were."

"He was fond of it." said Eugène. "He cried while he was breaking up the cup and plate. I happened to see him by accident."

"It was dear to him as his own life," answered the widow.

"There! you see how infatuated the old fellow is!" cried Vautrin. "The woman yonder can coax the soul out of him."

The student went up to his room. Vautrin went out, and a few minutes later Mme. Couture and Victorine drove away in a cab which Sylvie had called for them. Poiret gave his arm to Mlle. Michonneau, and they went together to spend the two sunniest hours of the day in the Jardin des Plantes.

"Well, those two are as good as married," was the portly Sylvie's comment. "They are going out together today for the first time. They are such a couple of dry sticks that if they happen to strike against each other they will draw sparks like flint and steel."

"Keep clear of Mlle. Michonneau's shawl, then," said Mme. Vauquer, laughing; "it would flare up like tinder."





At four o'clock that evening, when Goriot came in, he saw, by the light of two smoky lamps, that Victorine's eyes were red. Mme. Vauquer was listening to the history of the visit made that morning to M. Taillefer; it had been made in vain. Taillefer was tired of the annual application made by his daughter and her elderly friend; he gave them a personal interview in order to arrive at an understanding with them.

"My dear lady," said Mme. Couture, addressing Mme. Vauquer, "just imagine it; he did not even ask Victorine to sit down, she was standing the whole time. He said to me quite coolly, without putting himself in a passion, that we might spare ourselves the trouble of going there; that the young lady (he would not call her his daughter) was injuring her cause by importuning him (importuning! once a year, the wretch!); that as Victorine's mother had nothing when he married her, Victorine ought not to expect anything from him; in fact, he said the most cruel things, that made the poor child burst out crying. The little thing threw herself at her father's feet and spoke up bravely; she said that she only persevered in her visits for her mother's sake; that she would obey him without a murmur, but that she begged him to read her poor dead mother's farewell letter. She took it up and gave it to him, saying the most beautiful things in the world, most beautifully expressed; I do not know where she learned them; God must have put them into her head, for the poor child was inspired to speak so nicely that it made me cry like a fool to hear her talk. And what do you think the monster was doing all the time? Cutting his nails! He took the letter that poor Mme. Taillefer had soaked with tears, and flung it on to the chimneypiece. ‘That is all right,' he said. He held out his hands to raise his daughter, but she covered them with kisses, and he drew them away again. Scandalous, isn't it? And his great booby of a son came in and took no notice of his sister."

"What inhuman wretches they must be!" said Old Goriot.

"And then they both went out of the room," Mme. Couture went on, without heeding the worthy vermicelli-maker's exclamation; "father and son bowed to me, and asked me to excuse them on account of urgent business! That is the history of our call. Well, he has seen his daughter at any rate. How he can refuse to acknowledge her I cannot think, for they are as alike as two peas."

The boarders dropped in one after another, interchanging greetings and the empty jokes that certain classes of Parisians regard as humorous and witty. Dullness is their prevailing ingredient, and the whole point consists in mispronouncing a word or in a gesture. This kind of argot is always changing. The essence of the jest consists in some catchword suggested by a political event, an incident in the police courts, a street song, or a bit of burlesque at some theatre, and forgotten in a month. Anything and everything serves to keep up a game of battledore and shuttlecock with words and ideas. The diorama, a recent invention, which carried an optical illusion a degree further than panoramas, had given rise to a mania among art students for ending every word with rama. The Maison Vauquer had caught the infection from a young artist among the boarders.

"Well, Monsieur-r-r Poiret," said the employee from the Museum, "how is your health-orama?" Then, without waiting for an answer, he turned to Mme. Couture and Victorine with a "Ladies, you seem melancholy."

"Is dinner ready?" cried Horace Bianchon, a medical student, and a friend of Rastignac's; "my stomach is sinking usque ad talones."

"There is an uncommon frozerama outside," said Vautrin. "Make room there, Old Goriot! Confound it! your foot covers the whole front of the stove."

"Illustrious M. Vautrin," put in Bianchon, "why do you say frozerama? It is incorrect; it should be frozenrama."

"No, it shouldn't," said the official from the Museum; "frozerama is right by the same rule that you say ‘My feet are froze.'"

"Ah! ah!"

"Here is his Excellency the Marquis de Rastignac, Doctor of the Law of Contraries," cried Bianchon, seizing Eugène by the throat, and almost throttling him.

"Hallo there! hallo!"

Mlle. Michonneau came noiselessly in, bowed to the rest of the party, and took her place beside the three women without saying a word.

"That old bat always makes me shudder," said Bianchon in a low voice, indicating Mlle. Michonneau to Vautrin. "I have studied Gall's system, and I am sure she has the bump of Judas."

"Then you have seen a case before?" said Vautrin.

"Who has not?" answered Bianchon. "Upon my word, that ghastly old maid looks just like one of the long worms that will gnaw a beam through, give them time enough."

"That is the way, young man," returned he of the forty years and the dyed whiskers:


"The rose has lived the life of a rose—

A morning's space."



"Aha! here is a magnificent soupe-au-rama," cried Poiret as Christophe came in bearing the soup with cautious heed.

"I beg your pardon, sir," said Mme. Vauquer; "it is soupe aux choux."

All the young men roared with laughter.

"Had you there, Poiret!"

"Poir-r-r-rette! she had you there!"

"Score two points to Mamma Vauquer," said Vautrin.

"Did any one notice the fog this morning?" asked the official.

"It was a frantic fog," said Bianchon, "a fog unparalleled, doleful, melancholy, sea-green, asthmatical—a Goriot of a fog!"

"A Goriorama," said the art student, "because you couldn't see a thing in it."

"Hey! Milord Gâôriotte, they air talking about yoo-o-ou!"

Old Goriot, seated at the lower end of the table, close to the door through which the servant entered, raised his face; he had smelt at a scrap of bread that lay under his table napkin, an old trick acquired in his commercial capacity, that still showed itself at times.

"Well," Mme. Vauquer cried in sharp tones, that rang above the rattle of spoons and plates and the sound of other voices, "and is there anything the matter with the bread?"

"Nothing whatever, madame," he answered; "on the contrary, it is made of the best quality of corn; flour from étampes."

"How could you tell?" asked Eugène.

"By the color, by the flavor."

"You knew the flavor by the smell, I suppose," said Mme. Vauquer. "You have grown so economical, you will find out how to live on the smell of cooking at last."

"Take out a patent for it then," cried the Museum official; "you would make a handsome fortune."

"Never mind him," said the artist; "he does that sort of thing to delude us into thinking that he was a vermicelli-maker."

"Your nose is a corn-sampler, it appears?" inquired the official.

"Corn what?" asked Bianchon.

"Corn-el."

"Corn-et."

"Corn-elian."

"Corn-ice."

"Corn-ucopia."

"Corn-crake."

"Corn-cockle."

"Corn-orama."

The eight responses came like a rolling fire from every part of the room, and the laughter that followed was the more uproarious because poor Old Goriot stared at the others with a puzzled look, like a foreigner trying to catch the meaning of words in a language which he does not understand.

"Corn?..." he said, turning to Vautrin, his next neighbor.

"Corn on your foot, old man!" said Vautrin, and he drove Old Goriot's cap down over his eyes by a blow on the crown.

The poor old man thus suddenly attacked was for a moment too bewildered to do anything. Christophe carried off his plate, thinking that he had finished his soup, so that when Goriot had pushed back his cap from his eyes his spoon encountered the table. Every one burst out laughing. "You are a disagreeable joker, sir," said the old man, "and if you take any further liberties with me—"

"Well, what then, old boy?" Vautrin interrupted.

"Well, then, you shall pay dearly for it some day—"

"Down below, eh?" said the artist, "in the little dark corner where they put naughty boys."

"Well, mademoiselle," Vautrin said, turning to Victorine, "you are eating nothing. So papa was refractory, was he?"

"A monster!" said Mme. Couture.

"He must be brought to see reason," said Vantrin.

"Why," sid Rastignac, who was sitting near Bianchon, "Mademoiselle might make application for aliment pending her suit; she is not eating anything. Eh! eh! just see how Old Goriot is staring at Mlle. Victorine."

The old man had forgotten his dinner, he was so absorbed in gazing at the poor girl; the sorrow in her face was unmistakable,—the grief of a slighted child whose father would not recognize her.

"We are mistaken about Old Goriot, my dear boy," said Eugène in a low voice. "He is not an idiot, nor wanting in energy. Try your Gall system on him, and let me know what you think. I saw him crush a silver dish last night as if it had been made of wax; there seems to be something extraordinary going on in his mind just now, to judge by his face. His life is so mysterious that it must be worth studying. Oh! you may laugh, Bianchon; I am not joking."

"The man is a medical case, is he?" said Bianchon; "all right! I will dissect him, if he will give me the chance."

"No; feel his bumps."

"Hm!—his stupidity might perhaps be contagious."





The next day Rastignac dressed himself very elegantly, and about three o'clock in the afternoon went to call on Mme. de Restaud. On the way thither he indulged in the wild intoxicating dreams which fill a young head so full of delicious excitement. Young men at his age take no account of obstacles nor of dangers; they see success in every direction; imagination has free play, and turns their lives into a romance; they are saddened or discouraged by the collapse of one of the wild visionary schemes that have no existence save in their heated fancy. If youth were not ignorant and timid, civilization would be impossible.

Eugène took unheard-of pains to keep himself in a spotless condition, but on his way through the streets he began to think about Mme. de Restaud and what he should say to her. He equipped himself with wit, rehearsed repartees in the course of an imaginary conversation, and prepared certain neat speeches à la Talleyrand, conjuring up a series of small events which should prepare the way for the declaration on which he had based his future; and during these musings the law student was bespattered with mud, and by the time he reached the Palais Royal he was obliged to have his boots blacked and his trousers brushed.

"If I were rich," he said, as he changed the five-franc piece he had brought with him in case anything might happen, "I would take a cab, then I could think at my ease."

At last he reached the Rue du Helder, and asked for the Comtesse de Restaud. He bore the contemptuous glances of the servants, who had seen him cross the court on foot, and heard no carriage at the door, with the cold fury of a man who knows that he will succeed some day. He understood the meaning of their glances at once, for he had felt his inferiority as soon as he entered the court, where a smart cab was waiting. All the delights of life in Paris seemed to be implied by this visible and manifest sign of luxury and extravagance. A fine horse, in magnificent harness, was pawing the ground, and all at once the law student felt out of humor with himself. Every compartment in his brain which he had thought to find so full of wit was bolted fast; he grew positively stupid. He sent up his name to the Countess, and waited in the ante-chamber, standing on one foot before a window that looked out upon the court; mechanically he leaned his elbow against the sash, and stared before him. The time seemed long; he would have left the house but for the southern tenacity of purpose which works miracles when it is single-minded.

"Madame is in her boudoir, and cannot see any one at present, sir," said the servant. "She gave me no answer; but if you will go into the drawing-room, there is someone already there."

Rastignac was impressed with a sense of the formidable power of the lackey who can accuse or condemn his masters by a word; he coolly opened the door by which the man had just entered the ante-chamber, meaning, no doubt, to show these insolent flunkeys that he was familiar with the house; but he found that he had thoughtlessly precipitated himself into a small room full of dressers, where lamps were standing, and hot-water pipes, on which towels were being dried; a dark passage and a back staircase lay beyond it. Stifled laughter from the ante-chamber added to his confusion.

"This way to the drawing-room, sir," said the servant, with the exaggerated respect which seemed to be one more jest at his expense.

Eugène turned so quickly that he stumbled against a bath. By good luck, he managed to keep his hat on his head, and saved it from immersion in the water; but just as he turned, a door opened at the further end of the dark passage, dimly lighted by a small lamp. Rastignac heard voices and the sound of a kiss; one of the speakers was Mme. de Restaud, the other was Old Goriot. Eugène followed the servant through the dining-room into the drawing-room; he went to a window that looked out into the courtyard, and stood there for a while. He meant to know whether this Goriot was really the Goriot that he knew. His heart beat unwontedly fast; he remembered Vautrin's hideous insinuations. A well-dressed young man suddenly emerged from the room almost as Eugène entered it, saying impatiently to the servant who stood at the door: "I am going, Maurice. Tell Mme. la Comtesse that I waited more than half an hour for her."

Whereupon this insolent being, who, doubtless, had a right to be insolent, sang an Italian trill, and went towards the window where Eugène was standing, moved thereto quite as much by a desire to see the student's face as by a wish to look out into the courtyard.

"But M. le Comte had better wait a moment longer; Madame is disengaged," said Maurice, as he returned to the ante-chamber.

Just at that moment Old Goriot appeared close to the gate; he had emerged from a door at the foot of the back staircase. The poor soul was preparing to unfold his umbrella regardless of the fact that the great gate had opened to admit a tilbury, in which a young man with a ribbon at his buttonhole was seated. Old Goriot had scarcely time to start back and save himself. The horse took fright at the umbrella, swerved, and dashed forward towards the flight of steps. The young man looked round in annoyance, saw Old Goriot, and greeted him as he went out with constrained courtesy, such as people usually show to a money-lender so long as they require his services, or the sort of respect they feel it necessary to show for someone whose reputation has been tarnished, so that they blush to acknowledge his acquaintance. Old Goriot gave him a little friendly nod and a good-natured smile. All this happened with lightning speed. Eugène was so deeply interested that he forgot that he was not alone till he suddenly heard the Countess' voice.

"Oh! Maxime, were you going away?" she said reproachfully, with a shade of pique in her manner. The Countess had not seen the incident nor the entrance of the tilbury. Rastignac turned abruptly and saw her standing before him, coquettishly dressed in a loose white cashmere gown with knots of rose-colored ribbon here and there; her hair was carelessly coiled about her head, as is the wont of Parisian women in the morning; there was a soft fragrance about her—doubtless she was fresh from a bath;—her graceful form seemed more flexible, her beauty more luxuriant. Her eyes glistened. A young man can see everything at a glance; he feels the radiant influence of woman as a plant discerns and absorbs its nutriment from the air; he did not need to touch her hands to feel their cool freshness. He saw faint rose tints through the cashmere of the dressing gown; it had fallen slightly open, giving glimpses of a bare throat, on which the student's eyes rested. The Countess had no need of the adventitious aid of corsets; her girdle defined the outlines of her slender waist; her throat was a challenge to love; her feet, thrust into slippers, were daintily small. As Maxime took her hand and kissed it, Eugène became aware of Maxime's existence, and the Countess saw Eugène.

"Oh! is that you M. de Rastignac? I am very glad to see you," she said, but there was something in her manner that a shrewd observer would have taken as a hint to depart.

Maxime, as the Countess Anastasie had called the young man with the haughty insolence of bearing, looked from Eugène to the lady, and from the lady to Eugène; it was sufficiently evident that he wished to be rid of the latter. An exact and faithful rendering of the glance might be given in the words: "Look here, my dear; I hope you intend to send this little whipper-snapper about his business."

The Countess consulted the young man's face with an intent submissiveness that betrays all the secrets of a woman's heart, and Rastignac all at once began to hate him violently. To begin with, the sight of the fair, carefully arranged curls on the other's comely head had convinced him that his own crop was hideous; Maxime's boots, moreover, were elegant and spotless, while his own, in spite of all his care, bore some traces of his recent walk; and, finally, Maxime's overcoat fitted the outline of his figure gracefully, he looked like a pretty woman, while Eugène was wearing a black coat at half-past two. The quick-witted youth from the Charente felt the disadvantage at which he was placed beside this tall, slender dandy, with the clear gaze and the pale face, one of those men who would ruin orphan children without scruple. Mme. de Restaud fled into the next room without waiting for Eugène to speak; shaking out the skirts of her dressing-gown in her flight, so that she looked like a butterfly; and Maxime hurried after her. Eugène, in a fury, followed Maxime and the Countess, and the three stood once more face to face by the hearth in the large drawing-room. The law student felt quite sure that the odious Maxime found him in the way, and even at the risk of displeasing Mme. de Restaud, he meant to annoy the dandy. It had struck him all at once that he had seen the young man before at Mme. de Beauséant's ball; he guessed the relation between Maxime and Mme. de Restaud; and with the youthful audacity that commits prodigious blunders or achieves signal success, he said to himself, "This is my rival; I mean to cut him out."

Rash resolve! He did not know that M. le Comte Maxime de Trailles would wait till he was insulted, so as to fire first and kill his man. Eugène was a sportsman and a good shot, but he had not yet hit the bull's eye twenty times out of twenty-two. The young Count dropped into a low chair by the hearth, took up the tongs, and made up the fire so violently and so sulkily, that Anastasie's fair face suddenly clouded over. She turned to Eugène, with a cool, questioning glance that asked plainly: "Why do you not go?", a glance which well-bred people regard as a cue to make their exit.

Eugène assumed an amiable expression.

"Madame," he began, "I hastened to call upon you—"

He stopped short. The door opened, and the owner of the tilbury suddenly appeared. He had left his hat outside, and did not greet the Countess; he looked meditatively at Rastignac, and held out his hand to Maxime with a cordial "Good morning," that astonished Eugène not a little. The young provincial did not understand the amenities of a triple alliance.

"M. de Restaud," said the Countess, introducing her husband to the law student.

Eugène bowed profoundly.

"This gentleman," she continued, presenting Eugène to her husband, "is M. de Rastignac; he is related to Mme. la Vicomtesse de Beauséant through the Marcillacs; I had the pleasure of meeting him at her last ball."

Related to Mme. la Vicomtesse de Beauséant through the Marcillacs! These words, on which the countess threw ever so slight an emphasis, by reason of the pride that the mistress of a house takes in showing that she only receives people of distinction as visitors in her house, produced a magical effect. The Count's stiff manner relaxed at once as he returned the student's bow.

"Delighted to have an opportunity of making your acquaintance," he said.

Maxime de Trailles himself gave Eugène an uneasy glance, and suddenly dropped his insolent manner. The mighty name had all the power of a fairy's wand; those closed compartments in the southern brain flew open again; Rastignac's carefully drilled faculties returned. It was as if a sudden light had pierced the obscurity of this upper world of Paris, and he began to see, though everything was indistinct as yet. Mme. Vauquer's lodging-house and Old Goriot were very far remote from his thoughts.

"I thought that the Marcillacs were extinct," the Comte de Restaud said, addressing Eugène.

"Yes, they are extinct," answered the law student. "My great-uncle, the Chevalier de Rastignac, married the heiress of the Marcillac family. They had only one daughter, who married the Maréchal de Clarimbault, Mme. de Beauséant's grandfather on the mother's side. We are the younger branch of the family, and the younger branch is all the poorer because my great-uncle, the vice-admiral, lost all that he had in the king's service. The government during the Revolution refused to admit our claims when the East India Company was liquidated."

"Was not your great-uncle in command of the Vengeur before 1789?"

"Yes."

"Then he would be acquainted with my grandfather, who commanded the Warwick."

Maxime looked at Mme. de Restaud and shrugged his shoulders, as who should say, "If he is going to discuss nautical matters with that fellow, it is all over with us." Anastasie understood the glance that M. de Trailles gave her. With a woman's admirable tact, she began to smile, and said:

"Come with me, Maxime; I have something to say to you. We will leave you two gentlemen to sail in company on board the Warwick and the Vengeur."

She rose to her feet and signed to Maxime to follow her, mirth and mischief in her whole attitude, and the two went in the direction of the boudoir. The morganatic couple (to use a convenient German expression which has no exact equivalent) had reached the door, when the Count interrupted himself in his talk with Eugène.

"Anastasie!" he cried pettishly, "just stay a moment, dear; you know very well that—"

"I am coming back in a minute," she interrupted; "I have a commission for Maxime to execute, and I want to tell him about it."

She came back almost immediately. She had noticed the inflection in her husband's voice, and knew that it would not be safe to retire to the boudoir; like all women who are compelled to study their husbands' characters in order to have their own way, and whose business it is to know exactly how far they can go without endangering a good understanding, she was very careful to avoid petty collisions in domestic life. It was Eugène who had brought about this untoward incident; so the Countess looked at Maxime and indicated the law student with an air of exasperation. M. de Trailles addressed the Count, the Countess, and Eugène with the pointed remark, "You are busy, I do not want to interrupt you; good-day," and he went.

"Just wait a moment, Maxime!" the Count called after him.

"Come and dine with us," said the Countess, leaving Eugène and her husband together once more. She followed Maxime into the little drawing-room, where they sat together sufficiently long to feel sure that Rastignac had taken his leave.

The law student heard their laughter, and their voices, and the pauses in their talk; he grew malicious, exerted his conversational powers for M. de Restaud, flattered him, and drew him into discussions, to the end that he might see the Countess again and discover the nature of her relations with Old Goriot. This Countess with a husband and a lover, for Maxime clearly was her lover, was a mystery. What was the secret tie that bound her to the old tradesman? This mystery he meant to penetrate, hoping by its means to gain a sovereign ascendency over this fair typical Parisian.

"Anastasie!" the Count called again to his wife.

"Poor Maxime!" she said, addressing the young man. "Come, we must resign ourselves. This evening—"

"I hope, Nasie," he said in her ear, "that you will give orders not to admit that youngster, whose eyes light up like live coals when your dressing-gown falls open. He will make you a declaration, and compromise you, and then you will compel me to kill him."

"Are you mad, Maxime?" she said. "A young lad of a student is, on the contrary, a capital lightning-conductor; is not that so? Of course, I mean to make Restaud furiously jealous of him."

Maxime burst out laughing, and went out, followed by the Countess, who stood at the window to watch him into his carriage; he shook his whip, and made his horse prance. She only returned when the great gate had been closed after him.

"What do you think, dear?" cried the Count, her husband, "this gentleman's family estate is not far from Verteuil, on the Charente; his great-uncle and my grandfather were acquainted."

"Delighted to find that we have acquaintances in common," said the Countess, with a preoccupied manner.

"More than you think," said Eugène, in a low voice.

"What do you mean?" she asked quickly.

"Why, only just now," said the student, "I saw a gentleman go out at the gate, Old Goriot, my next-door neighbor in the house where I am lodging."

At the sound of this name, and the prefix that embellished it, the Count, who was stirring the fire, let the tongs fall as though they had burned his fingers, and rose to his feet.

"Sir," he cried, "you might have called him 'Monsieur Goriot'!"

The Countess turned pale at first at the sight of her husband's vexation, then she reddened; clearly she was embarrassed, her answer was made in a tone that she tried to make natural, and with an air of assumed carelessness:

"You could not know any one who is dearer to us both..."

She broke off, glanced at the piano as if some fancy had crossed her mind, and asked, "Are you fond of music, M. de Rastignac?"

"Exceedingly," answered Eugène, flushing, and disconcerted by a dim suspicion that he had somehow been guilty of a clumsy piece of folly.

"Do you sing?" she cried, going to the piano, and, sitting down before it, she swept her fingers over the keyboard from end to end. R-r-r-rah!

"No, madame."

The Comte de Restaud walked to and fro.

"That is a pity; you are without one great means of success.—Ca-ro, ca-a-ro, ca-a-a-ro, non du-bi-ta-re," sang the Countess.

Eugène had a second time waved a magic wand when he uttered Goriot's name, but the effect seemed to be entirely opposite to that produced by the formula "related to Mme. de Beauséant." His position was not unlike that of some visitor permitted as a favor to inspect a private collection of curiosities, when by inadvertence he comes into collision with a glass case full of sculptured figures, and three or four heads, imperfectly secured, fall at the shock. He wished the earth would open and swallow him. Mme. de Restaud's expression was reserved and chilly, her eyes had grown indifferent, and sedulously avoided meeting those of the unlucky student of law.

"Madame," he said, "you wish to talk with M. de Restaud; permit me to wish you goodday—"

The Countess interrupted him by a gesture, saying hastily, "Whenever you come to see us, both M. de Restaud and I shall be delighted to see you."

Eugène made a profound bow and took his leave, followed by M. de Restaud, who insisted, in spite of his remonstrances, on accompanying him into the hall.

"Neither your mistress nor I are at home to that gentleman when he calls," the Count said to Maurice.

As Eugène set foot on the steps, he saw that it was raining.

"Come," said he to himself, "somehow I have just made a mess of it, I do not know how. And now I am going to spoil my hat and coat into the bargain. I ought to stop in my corner, grind away at law, and never look to be anything but a boorish country magistrate. How can I go into society, when to manage properly you want a lot of cabs, polished boots, gold watch-chains, and all sorts of things; you have to wear white doeskin gloves that cost six francs in the morning, and primrose kid gloves every evening? Devil take Old Goriot!"

When he reached the street door, the driver of a hackney coach, who had probably just deposited a wedding party at their door, and asked nothing better than a chance of making a little money for himself without his employer's knowledge, saw that Eugène had no umbrella, remarked his black coat, white waistcoat, yellow gloves, and varnished boots, and stopped and looked at him inquiringly. Eugène, in the blind desperation that drives a young man to plunge deeper and deeper into an abyss, as if he might hope to find a fortunate issue in its lowest depths, nodded in reply to the driver's signal, and stepped into the cab; a few stray petals of orange blossom and scraps of wire bore witness to its recent occupation by a wedding party.

"Where am I to drive, sir?" demanded the man, who by this time had taken off his white gloves.

"Confound it!" Eugène said to himself, "I am in for it now, and at least I will not spend cab-hire for nothing! Drive to the Hôtel Beauséant," he said aloud.

"Which?" asked the man, a portentous word that reduced Eugène to confusion. This young man of fashion, species incerta, did not know that there were two Hôtels Beauséant; he was not aware how rich he was in relations who did not care about him.

"The Vicomte de Beauséant, Rue—"

"De Grenelle," interrupted the driver, with a jerk of his head. "You see, there are the hotels of the Marquis and Comte de Beauséant in the Rue Saint-Dominique," he added, drawing up the step.

"I know all about that," said Eugène, severely." Everybody is laughing at me today, it seems!" he said to himself, as he deposited his hat on the opposite seat. "This escapade will cost me a king's ransom, but, at any rate, I shall call on my so-called cousin in a thoroughly aristocratic fashion. Goriot has cost me ten francs already, the old scoundrel! My word! I will tell Mme. de Beauséant about my adventure; perhaps it may amuse her. Doubtless she will know the secret of the criminal relation between that handsome woman and the old rat without a tail. It would be better to find favor in my cousin's eyes than to come in contact with that shameless woman, who seems to me to have very expensive tastes. Surely the beautiful Vicomtesse's personal interest would turn the scale for me, when the mere mention of her name produces such an effect. Let us look higher. If you set yourself to carry the heights of heaven, you must face God."

The innumerable thoughts that surged through his brain might be summed up in these phrases. He grew calmer, and recovered something of his assurance as he watched the falling rain. He told himself that though he was about to squander two of the precious five-franc pieces that remained to him, the money was well laid out in preserving his coat, boots, and hat; and his cabman's cry of "Gate, if you please," almost put him in spirits. A Swiss, in scarlet and gold, appeared, the great door groaned on its hinges, and Rastignac, with sweet satisfaction, beheld his equipage pass under the archway and stop before the flight of steps beneath the awning. The driver, in a blue-and-red greatcoat, dismounted and let down the step. As Eugène stepped out of the cab, he heard smothered laughter from the peristyle. Three or four lackeys were making merry over the festal appearance of the vehicle. In another moment the law student was enlightened as to the cause of their hilarity; he felt the full force of the contrast between his equipage and one of the smartest broughams in Paris; a coachman, with powdered hair, seemed to find it difficult to hold a pair of spirited horses, who stood chafing the bit. In Mme. de Restaud's courtyard, in the Chaussée d'Antin, he had seen the neat turn-out of a young man of six-and-twenty; in the Faubourg Saint-Germain he found the luxurious equipage of a man of rank; thirty thousand francs would not have purchased it.

"Who can be here?" said Eugène to himself. He began to understand, though somewhat tardily, that he must not expect to find many women in Paris who were not already appropriated, and that the capture of one of these queens would be likely to cost something more than bloodshed. "Confound it all! I expect my cousin also has her Maxime."

He went up the steps, feeling that he was a blighted being. The glass door was opened for him; the servants were as solemn as jackasses under the curry-comb. So far, Eugène had only been in the ballroom on the ground floor of the Hôtel Beauséant; the fěte had followed so closely on the invitation that he had not had time to call on his cousin, and had therefore never seen Mme. de Beauséant's apartments; he was about to behold for the first time a great lady among the wonderful and elegant surroundings that reveal her character and reflect her daily life. He was the more curious, because Mme. de Restaud's drawing-room had provided him with a standard of comparison.

At half-past four the Vicomtesse de Beauséant was visible. Five minutes earlier she would not have received her cousin, but Eugène knew nothing of the recognized routine of various houses in Paris. He was conducted up the wide, white-painted, crimson-carpeted staircase, between the gilded balusters and masses of flowering plants, to Mme. de Beauséant's apartments. He did not know the rumor current about Mme. de Beauséant, one of the biographies told, with variations, in whispers, every evening in the salons of Paris.

For three years past her name had been spoken of in connection with that of one of the most wealthy and distinguished Portuguese nobles, the Marquis d'Ajuda-Pinto. It was one of those innocent liaisons which possess so much charm for the two thus attached to each other that they find the presence of a third person intolerable. The Vicomte de Beauséant, therefore, had himself set an example to the rest of the world by respecting, with as good a grace as might be, this morganatic union. Any one who came to call on the Vicomtesse at two o'clock in the early days of this friendship was sure to find the Marquis d'Ajuda-Pinto there. As, under the circumstances, Mme. de Beauséant could not very well shut her door against these visitors, she gave them such a cold reception, and showed so much interest in the study of the ceiling, that no one could fail to understand how much he bored her; and when it became known in Paris that Mme. de Beauséant was bored by callers between two and four o'clock, she was left in perfect solitude during that interval. She went to the Bouffons or to the Opéra with M. de Beauséant and M. d'Ajuda-Pinto; and M. de Beauséant, like a well-bred man of the world, always left his wife and the Portuguese as soon as he had installed them. But M. d'Ajuda-Pinto must marry, and a Mlle. de Rochefide was the young lady. In the whole fashionable world there was but one person who as yet knew nothing of the arrangement, and that was Mme. de Beauséant. Some of her friends had hinted at the possibility, and she had laughed at them, believing that envy had prompted those ladies to try to make mischief. And now, though the banns were about to be published, and although the handsome Portuguese had come that day to break the news to the Vicomtesse, he had not found courage as yet to say one word about his treachery. How was it? Nothing is doubtless more difficult than the notification of an ultimatum of this kind. There are men who feel more at their ease when they stand up before another man who threatens their lives with sword or pistol than in the presence of a woman who, after two hours of lamentations and reproaches, falls into a dead swoon and requires salts. At this moment, therefore, M. d'Ajuda-Pinto was on thorns, and anxious to take his leave. He told himself that in some way or other the news would reach Mme. de Beauséant; he would write, it would be much better to do it by letter, and not to utter the words that should stab her to the heart.

So when the servant announced M. Eugène de Rastignac, the Marquis d'Ajuda-Pinto trembled with joy. To be sure, a loving woman shows even more ingenuity in inventing doubts of her lover than in varying the monotony of his happiness; and when she is about to be forsaken, she instinctively interprets every gesture more rapidly than Virgil's courser detected the presence of his companion by snuffing the breeze. It was impossible, therefore, that Mme. de Beauséant should not detect that involuntary thrill of satisfaction; slight though it was, it was appalling in its artlessness.

Eugène had yet to learn that no one in Paris should present himself in any house without first making himself acquainted with the whole history of its owner, and of its owner's wife and family, so that he may avoid making any of the terrible blunders which in Poland draw forth the picturesque exclamation, "Harness five bullocks to your cart!" probably because you will need them all to pull you out of the quagmire into which a false step has plunged you. If, down to the present day, our language has no name for these conversational disasters, it is probably because they are believed to be impossible, the publicity given in Paris to every scandal is so prodigious. After the awkward incident at Mme. de Restaud's, where that lady had not even left him time to harness the five bullocks to his cart, no one but Eugène could have reappeared in his character of bullock-driver in Mme. de Beauséant's drawing-room. But if Mme. de Restaud and M. de Trailles had found him horribly in the way, M. d'Ajuda hailed his coming with relief.

"Good-bye," said the Portuguese, hurrying to the door, as Eugène made his entrance into a dainty little pink-and-gray drawing-room, where luxury seemed nothing more than good taste.

"Until this evening," said Mme. de Beauséant, turning her head to give the Marquis a glance. "We are going to the Bouffons, are we not?"

"I cannot go," he said, with his fingers on the door handle.

Mme. de Beauséant rose and beckoned to him to return. She did not pay the slightest attention to Eugène, who stood there dazzled by the sparkling marvels around him; he began to think that this was some story out of the Arabian Nights made real, and did not know where to hide himself, when the woman before him seemed to be unconscious of his existence. The Vicomtesse had raised the forefinger of her right hand, and gracefully signed to the Marquis to seat himself beside her. The Marquis felt the imperious sway of passion in her gesture; he came back towards her. Eugène watched him, not without a feeling of envy.

"That is the owner of the brougham!" he said to himself. "But is it necessary to have a pair of spirited horses, servants in livery, and torrents of gold to draw a glance from a woman here in Paris?"

The demon of luxury gnawed at his heart, greed burned in his veins, his throat was parched with the thirst of gold.

He had a hundred and thirty francs every quarter. His father, mother, brothers, sisters, and aunt did not spend two hundred francs a month among them. This swift comparison between his present condition and the aims he had in view helped to benumb his faculties.

"Why not?" the Vicomtesse was saying, as she smiled at the Portuguese. "Why cannot you come to the Italiens?"

"Affairs! I am to dine with the English Ambassador."

"Throw him over."

When a man once enters on a course of deception, he is compelled to add lie to lie. M. d'Ajuda therefore said, smiling: "Do you insist?"

"Yes, certainly."

"That was what I wanted to have you say to me," he answered, dissembling his feelings in a glance which would have reassured any other woman.

He took the Vicomtesse's hand, kissed it, and went.

Eugène ran his fingers through his hair, and constrained himself to bow. He thought that now Mme. de Beauséant would give him her attention; but suddenly she sprang forward, rushed to a window in the gallery, and watched M. d'Ajuda step into his carriage; she listened to the order that he gave, and heard the Swiss repeat it to the coachman:

"To M. de Rochefide's house."

Those words, and the way in which M. d'Ajuda flung himself back in the carriage, were like a lightning flash and a thunderbolt for her; she walked back again with a deadly fear gnawing at her heart. Hers was the morst calamity possible in the fashionable world. The Vicomtesse went to her own room, sat down at a table, and took up a sheet of dainty notepaper.


"When, instead of dining with the English Ambassador," she wrote, "you go to the Rochefides, you owe me an explanation, which I am waiting to hear."



She retraced several of the letters, for her hand was trembling so that they were indistinct; then she signed the note with an initial C for "Claire de Bourgogne," and rang the bell.

"Jacques," she said to the servant, who appeared immediately, "take this note to M. de Rochefide's house at half-past seven, and ask for the Marquis d'Ajuda. If M. d'Ajuda is there, leave the note without waiting for an answer; if he is not there, bring the note back to me."

"Madame la Vicomtesse, there is a visitor in the drawing-room."

"Ah! yes, of course," she said, opening the door.

Eugène was beginning to feel very uncomfortable, but at last the Vicomtesse appeared; she spoke to him, and the tremulous tones of her voice vibrated through his heart.

"Pardon me, monsieur," she said; "I had a letter to write. Now I am quite at liberty."

She scarcely knew what she was saying, for even as she spoke she thought, "Ah! he means to marry Mlle. de Rochefide? But is he still free? This evening the marriage shall be broken off, or else... but before to-morrow I shall know."

"Cousin..." the student replied.

"Eh?" said the Countess, with an insolent glance that sent a cold shudder through Eugène; he understood what that "Eh?" meant; he had learned a great deal in three hours, and his wits were on the alert. He reddened.

"Madame..." he began; he hesitated a moment, and then went on. "Pardon me; I am in such need of protection that the merest scrap of relationship could do me no harm."

Mme. de Beauséant smiled, but there was sadness in her smile; even now she felt forebodings of the coming pain, the air she breathed was heavy with the storm that was about to burst.

"If you knew how my family are situated," he went on, "you would love to play the part of a beneficent fairy godmother who graciously clears the obstacles from the path of her protégé."

"Well, cousin," she said, laughing, "and how can I be of service to you?"

"But do I know even that? I am distantly related to you, and this obscure and remote relationship is even now a perfect godsend to me. You have confused my ideas; I cannot remember the things that I meant to say to you. I know no one else here in Paris.... Ah! if I could only ask you to counsel me, ask you to look upon me as a poor child who would fain cling to the hem of your dress, who would lay down his life for you."

"Would you kill a man for me?"

"Two," said Eugène.

"You, child! Yes, you are a child," she said, keeping back the tears that came to her eyes; "you would love sincerely."

"Oh!" he cried, flinging up his head.

The audacity of the student's answer interested the Vicomtesse in him. The southern brain was beginning to scheme for the first time. Between Mme. de Restaud's blue boudoir and Mme. de Beauséant's rose-colored drawing-room he had made a three years' advance in a kind of law which is not a recognized study in Paris, although it is a sort of higher jurisprudence, and, when well understood, is a highroad to success of every kind.

"Ah! that is what I meant to say!" said Eugène. "I met Mme. de Restaud at your ball, and this morning I went to see her.

"You must have been very much in the way," said Mme. de Beauséant, smiling as she spoke.

"Yes, indeed. I am a novice, and my blunders will set every one against me, if you do not give me your counsel. I believe that in Paris it is very difficult to meet with a young, beautiful, and wealthy woman of fashion who would be willing to teach me what you women can explain so well—life. I shall find a M. de Trailles everywhere. So I have come to you to ask you to give me a key to a puzzle, to entreat you to tell me what sort of blunder I made this morning. I mentioned an old man—"

"Mme. la Duchess de Langeais." Jacques cut the student short; Eugène gave expression to his intense annoyance by a gesture.

"If you mean to succeed," said the Vicomtesse in a low voice, "in the first place you must not be so demonstrative."

"Ah! good morning, dear," she continued, and, rising and crossing the room, she grasped the Duchess' hands as affectionately as if they had been sisters; the Duchess responded in the prettiest and most gracious way.

"Two intimate friends!" said Rastignac to himself. "Henceforward I shall have two protectresses; those two women are great friends, no doubt, and this newcomer will doubtless interest herself in her friend's cousin."

"To what happy inspiration do I owe this piece of good fortune, dear Antoinette?" asked Mme. de Beauséant.

"Well, I saw M. d'Ajuda-Pinto at M. de Rochefide's door, so I thought that if I came I should find you alone."

Mme. de Beauséant's mouth did not tighten, her color did not rise, her expression did not alter, or rather, her brow seemed to clear as the Duchess uttered those deadly words.

"If I had known that you were engaged—" the speaker added, glancing at Eugène.

"This gentleman is M. Eugène de Rastignac, one of my cousins," said the Vicomtesse. "Have you any news of General de Montriveau?" she continued. "Sérizy told me yesterday that he never goes anywhere now; has he been to see you today?"

It was believed that the Duchess was desperately in love with M. de Montriveau, and that he was a faithless lover; she felt the question in her very heart, and her face flushed as she answered:

"He was at the élysée yesterday."

"In attendance?"

"Claire," returned the Duchess, and hatred overflowed in the glances she threw at Mme. de Beauséant; "of course you know that M. d'Ajuda-Pinto is going to marry Mlle. de Rochefide; the banns will be published to-morrow."

This thrust was too cruel; the Vicomtesse's face grew white, but she answered, laughing, "One of those rumors that fools amuse themselves with. What should induce M. d'Ajuda to take one of the noblest names in Portugal to the Rochefides? The Rochefides were only ennobled yesterday."

"But Berthe will have two hundred thousand livres a year, they say."

"M. d'Ajuda is too wealthy to marry for money."

"But, my dear, Mlle. de Rochefide is a charming girl."

"Indeed?"

"And, as a matter of fact, he is dining with them today; the thing is settled. It is very surprising to me that you should know so little about it."

Mme. de Beauséant turned to Rastignac. "What was the blunder that you made, monsieur?" she asked. "The poor boy is only just launched into the world, Antoinette, so that he understands nothing of all this that we are speaking of. Be merciful to him, and let us finish our talk to-morrow. Everything will be announced to-morrow, you know, and your kind informal communication can be accompanied by official confirmation."

The Duchess gave Eugène one of those insolent glances that measure a man from head to foot and leave him crushed and annihilated.

"Madame, I have unwittingly plunged a dagger into Mme. de Restaud's heart; unwittingly—therein lies my offence," said the student of law, whose keen brain had served him sufficiently well, for he had detected the biting epigrams that lurked beneath this friendly talk. "You continue to receive, possibly you fear, those who know the amount of pain that they deliberately inflict; but a clumsy blunderer who has no idea how deeply he wounds is looked upon as a fool who does not know how to make use of his opportunities, and every one despises him."

Mme. de Beauséant gave the student a glance, one of those glances in which a great soul can mingle dignity and gratitude. It was like balm to the law student, who was still smarting under the Duchess' insolent scrutiny; she had looked at him as an auctioneer might look at some article to appraise its value.

"Imagine, too, that I had just made some progress with the Comte de Restaud; for I should tell you, madame," he went on, turning to the Duchess with a mixture of humility and malice in his manner, "that as yet I am only a poor devil of a student, very much alone in the world, and very poor—"

"You should not tell us that, M. de Rastignac. We women never care about anything that no one else will take."

"Bah!" said Eugène. "I am only two-and-twenty, and I must make up my mind to the drawbacks of my time of life. Besides, I am confessing my sins, and it would be impossible to kneel in a more charming confessional; you commit your sins in one drawing-room, and receive absolution for them in another."

The Duchess' expression grew colder, she did not like the flippant tone of these remarks, and showed that she considered them to be in bad taste by turning to the Vicomtesse with:"This gentleman has only just come—"

Mme. de Beauséant began to laugh outright at her cousin and at the Duchess both.

"He has only just come to Paris, dear, and is in search of someone who will give him lessons in good taste."

"Mme. la Duchesse," said Eugène, "is it not natural to wish to be initiated into the mysteries which charm us?" ("Come, now," he said to himself, "my language is superfinely elegant, I'm sure.")

"But Mme. de Restaud is herself, I believe, M. de Trailles' pupil," said the Duchess.

"Of that I had no idea, madame," answered the law student, "so I rashly came between them. In fact, I got on very well with the lady's husband, and his wife tolerated me for a time until I took it into my head to tell them that I knew someone of whom I had just caught a glimpse as he went out by a back staircase, a man who had given the Countess a kiss at the end of a passage."

"Who was it?" both women asked together.

"An old man who lives for two louis a month in the Faubourg Saint-Marcel, where I, a poor student, lodge likewise. He is a truly unfortunate creature, everybody laughs at him—we all call him ‘Father Goriot.'"

"Why, child that you are," cried the Vicomtesse, "Mme. de Restaud was a Mlle. Goriot!"

"The daughter of a vermicelli manufacturer," the Duchess added; "and when the little creature went to court, the daughter of a pastry-cook was presented on the same day. Do you remember, Claire? The king began to laugh, and made some joke in Latin about flour. People—what was it?— people—"

"Ejusdem farina," said Eugène.

"Yes, that was it," said the Duchess.

"Oh! is that her father?" the law student continued, aghast.

"Yes, certainly; the old man had two daughters; he dotes on them, so to speak, though they will scarcely acknowledge him."

"Didn't the second daughter marry a banker with a German name?" the Vicomtesse asked, turning to Mme. de Langeais, "a Baron de Nucingen? And her name is Delphine, is it not? Isn't she a fair-haired woman who has a side-box at the Opéra? She comes sometimes to the Bouffons, and laughs loudly to attract attention."

The Duchess smiled, and said:

"I wonder at you, dear. Why do you take so much interest in people of that kind? One must have been as madly in love as Restaud was, to be infatuated with Mlle. Anastasie and her flour sacks. Oh! he will not find her a good bargain! She is in M. de Trailles' hands, and he will ruin her."

"And they do not acknowledge their father!" Eugène repeated.

"Oh! well, yes, their father, the father, a father," replied the Vicomtesse, "a kind father who gave them each five or six hundred thousand francs, it is said, to secure their happiness by marrying them well; while he only kept eight or ten thousand livres a year for himself, thinking that his daughters would always be his daughters, thinking that in them he would live his life twice over again, that in their houses he should find two homes, where he would be loved and looked up to, and made much of. And in two years' time both his sons-in-law had turned him out of their houses as if he were one of the lowest outcasts."

Tears came into Eugène's eyes. He was still under the spell of youthful beliefs, he had just left home, pure and sacred feelings had been stirred within him, and this was his first day on the battlefield of civilization in Paris. Genuine feeling is so infectious that for a moment the three looked at each other in silence.

"Eh, mon Dieu!" said Mme. de Langeais; "yes, it seems very horrible, and yet we see such things every day. Is there not a reason for it? Tell me, dear, have you ever really thought what a son-in-law is? A son-in-law is the man for whom we bring up, you and I, a dear little one, bound to us very closely in innumerable ways; for seventeen years she will be the joy of her family, its 'white soul,' as Lamartine says, and suddenly she will become its scourge. When he comes and takes her from us, his love from the very beginning is like an axe laid to the root of all the old affection in our darling's heart, and all the ties that bound her to her family are severed. But yesterday our little daughter thought of no one but her mother and father, as we had no thought that was not for her; by to-morrow she will have become a hostile stranger. The tragedy is always going on under our eyes. On the one hand you see a father who has sacrificed himself to his son, and his daughter-in-law shows him the last degree of insolence. On the other hand, it is the son-in-law who turns his wife's mother out of the house. I sometimes hear it said that there is nothing dramatic about society in these days; but the Drama of the Son-in-law is appalling, to say nothing of our marriages, which have come to be very poor farces. I can explain how it all came about in the old vermicelli-maker's case. I think I recollect that Foriot—"

"Goriot, madame."

"Yes, that Moriot was once president of his section during the Revolution. He was in the secret of the famous scarcity of grain, and laid the foundation of his fortune in those days by selling flour for ten times its cost. He had as much flour as he wanted. My grandmother's steward sold him immense quantities. No doubt Noriot shared the plunder with the Committee of Public Safety, as that sort of person always did. I recollect the steward telling my grandmother that she might live at Grandvilliers in complete security, because her corn was as good as a certificate of patriotism. Well, then, this Loriot, who sold corn to those butchers, has never had but one passion, they say—he idolizes his daughters. He settled one of them under Restaud's roof, and grafted the other into the Nucingen family tree, the Baron de Nucingen being a rich banker who had turned Royalist. You can quite understand that so long as Buonaparte was emperor, the two sons-in-law could manage to put up with the old Ninety-three; but after the restoration of the Bourbons, M. de Restaud felt bored by the old man's society, and the banker was still more tired of it. His daughters were still fond of him; they wanted ‘to keep the goat and the cabbage,' so they used to see the Joriot whenever there was no one there, under pretence of affection. ‘Come today, papa, we shall have you all to ourselves, and that will be much nicer!' and all that sort of thing. As for me, dear, I believe that love has second sight: poor Ninety-three, his heart must have bled! He saw that his daughters were ashamed of him, that if they loved their husbands his visits must make mischief. So he immolated himself. He made the sacrifice because he was a father; he went into voluntary exile. His daughters were satisfied, so he thought that he had done the best thing he could; but it was a family crime, and father and daughters were accomplices. You see this sort of thing everywhere. What could this old Doriot have been but a splash of mud in his daughters' drawing-rooms? He would only have been in the way, and bored other people, besides being bored himself. And this that happened between father and daughters may happen to the prettiest woman in Paris and the man she loves the best; if her love grows tiresome, he will go; he will descend to the basest trickery to leave her. It is the same with all love and friendship. Our heart is a treasury; if you pour out all its wealth at once, you are bankrupt. We show no more mercy to the affection that reveals its utmost extent than we do to another kind of prodigal who has not a penny left. Their father had given them all he had. For twenty years he had given his whole heart to them; then, one day, he gave them all his fortune too. The lemon was squeezed; the girls left the peel in the gutter."

"The world is very base," said the Vicomtesse, plucking at the threads of her shawl. She did not raise her eyes as she spoke; the words that Mme. de Langeais had meant for her in the course of the story had cut her to the quick.

"Base? Oh, no," answered the Duchess; "the world goes its own way, that is all. If I speak in this way, it is only to show that I am not duped by it. I think as you do," she said, pressing the Vicomtesse's hand. "The world is a slough; let us try to live on the heights above it."

She rose to her feet and kissed Mme. de Beauséant on the forehead as she said: "You look very charming today, dear. I have never seen such a lovely color in your cheeks before."

Then she went out with a slight inclination of the head to the cousin.

"Old Goriot is sublime!" said Eugène to himself, as he remembered how he had watched his neighbor work the silver vessel into a shapeless mass that night.

Mme. de Beauséant did not hear him; she was absorbed in her own thoughts. For several minutes the silence remained unbroken till the law student became almost paralyzed with embarrassment, and was equally afraid to go or stay or speak a word.

"The world is basely ungrateful and ill-natured," said the Vicomtesse at last. "No sooner does a trouble befall you than a friend is ready to bring the tidings and to probe your heart with the point of a dagger while calling on you to admire the handle. Epigrams and sarcasms already! Ah! I will defend myself!"

She raised her head like the great lady that she was, and lightnings flashed from her proud eyes.

"Ah!" she said, as she saw Eugène, "are you there?"

"Still," he said piteously.

"Well, then, M. de Rastignac, deal with the world as it deserves. You are determined to succeed? I will help you. You shall sound the depths of corruption in woman; you shall measure the extent of man's wretched vanity. Deeply as I am versed in such learning, there were pages in the book of life that I had not read. Now I know all. The more cold-blooded your calculations, the further you will go. Strike ruthlessly; you will be feared. Men and women for you must be nothing more than post-horses; take a fresh relay, and leave the last to drop by the roadside; in this way you will reach the goal of your ambition. You will be nothing here, you see, unless a woman interests herself in you; and she must be young and wealthy, and a woman of the world. Yet, if you have a heart, lock it carefully away like a treasure; do not let any one suspect it, or you will be lost; you would cease to be the executioner, you would take the victim's place. And if ever you should love, never let your secret escape you! Trust no one until you are very sure of the heart to which you open your heart. Learn to mistrust every one; take every precaution for the sake of the love which does not exist as yet. Listen, Miguel"—the name slipped from her so naturally that she did not notice her mistake—"there is something still more appalling than the ingratitude of daughters who have cast off their old father and wish that he were dead, and that is a rivalry between two sisters. Restaud comes of a good family, his wife has been received into their circle; she has been presented at court; and her sister, her wealthy sister, Mme. Delphine de Nucingen, the wife of a capitalist, is consumed with envy, and ready to die of spleen. There is gulf set between the sisters—indeed, they are sisters no longer—the two women who refuse to acknowledge their father do not acknowledge each other. So Mme. de Nucingen would lap up all the mud that lies between the Rue Saint-Lazare and the Rue de Grenelle to gain admittance to my salon. She fancied that she should gain her end through de Marsay; she has made herself de Marsay's slave, and she bores him. De Marsay cares very little about her. If you will introduce her to me, you will be her darling, her Benjamin; she will idolize you. If, after that, you can love her, do so; if not, make her useful. I will ask her to come once or twice to one of my great crushes, but I will never receive her here in the morning. I will bow to her when I see her, and that will be quite sufficient. You have shut the Comtesse de Restaud's door against you by mentioning Old Goriot's name. Yes, my good friend, you may call at her house twenty times, and every time out of the twenty you will find that she is not at home. The servants have their orders, and will not admit you. Very well, then, now let Old Goriot gain the right of entry into her sister's house for you. The beautiful Mme. de Nucingen will give the signal for a battle. As soon as she singles you out, other women will begin to lose their heads about you, and her enemies and rivals and intimate friends will all try to take you from her. There are women who will fall in love with a man because another woman has chosen him; like the middle-class women, poor things, who copy our millinery and hope thereby to acquire our manners. You will have a success, and in Paris success is everything; it is the key of power. If the women credit you with wit and talent, the men will follow suit so long as you do not undeceive them yourself. There will be nothing you may not aspire to; you will go everywhere, and you will find out what the world is—an assemblage of fools and knaves. But you must be neither the one nor the other. I am giving you my name like Ariadne's clue of thread to take with you into the labyrinth; make no unworthy use of it," she said, with a queenly glance and curve of her throat; "give it back to me unsullied. And now, go; leave me. We women also have our battles to fight."

"And if you should ever need someone who would gladly set a match to a train for you—"

"Well?" she asked.

He tapped his heart, smiled in answer to his cousin's smile, and went.

It was five o'clock, and Eugène was hungry; he was afraid lest he should not be in time for dinner, a misgiving which made him feel that it was pleasant to be borne so quickly across Paris. This sensation of physical comfort left his mind free to grapple with the thoughts that assailed him. A mortification usually sends a young man of his age into a furious rage; he shakes his fists at society, and vows vengeance when his belief in himself is shaken. Just then Rastignac was overwhelmed by the words, "You have shut the Countess' door against you."

"I shall call!" he said to himself, "and if Mme. de Beauséant is right, if I never find her at home—I... well, Mme. de Restaud shall meet me in every salon in Paris. I will learn to fence, and have some pistol practice, and kill that Maxime of hers!"

"And money?" cried an inward monitor. "How about money, where is that to come from?" And all at once the wealth displayed in the Countess de Restaud's drawing-room rose before his eyes. That was the luxury which Goriot's daughter had loved too well; the gilding, the ostentatious splendor, the unintelligent luxury of the parvenu, the riotous extravagance of a courtesan. Then the attractive vision suddenly went under an eclipse as he remembered the stately grandeur of the Hôtel de Beauséant. As his fancy wandered among these lofty regions in the great world of Paris, innumerable dark thoughts gathered in his heart; his ideas widened, and his conscience grew more elastic. He saw the world as it is; saw how the rich lived beyond the jurisdiction of law and public opinion, and found in success the ultima ratio mundi.

"Vautrin is right, success is virtue!" he said to himself.





Arrived in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève, he rushed up to his room for ten francs wherewith to satisfy the demands of the cabman, and went in to dinner. He glanced round the squalid room, saw the eighteen poverty-stricken creatures about to feed like cattle in their stalls, and the sight filled him with loathing. The transition was too sudden, and the contrast was so violent that it could not but act as a powerful stimulant; his ambition developed and grew beyond all bounds. On the one hand, he beheld a vision of social life in its most charming and refined forms, of quick-pulsed youth, of fair, impassioned faces invested with all the charm of poetry, framed in a marvelous setting of luxury or art; and, on the other hand, he saw a sombre picture, the miry verge beyond these faces, in which passion was extinct and nothing was left of the drama but the cords and pulleys and bare mechanism. Mme. de Beauséant's counsels, the words uttered in anger by the forsaken lady, her petulant offer, came to his mind, and poverty was a ready expositor. Rastignac determined to open two parallel trenches so as to ensure success; he would be a learned doctor of law and a man of fashion. Clearly he was still a child! Those two lines are asymptotes, and will never meet.

"You are very gloomy, my lord Marquis," said Vautrin, with one of the shrewd glances that seem to read the innermost secrets of another mind.

"I am not in the humor to stand jokes from people who call me ‘my lord Marquis,'" answered Eugène. "A marquis here in Paris, if he is not the merest sham, ought to have a hundred thousand livres a year at least; and a lodger in the Maison Vauquer is not exactly Fortune's favorite."

Vautrin's glance at Rastignac was half paternal, half contemptuous. "Puppy!" it seemed to say; "I should make one mouthful of him!" Then he answered:

"You are in a bad humor; perhaps your visit to the beautiful Comtesse de Restaud was not a success."

"She has shut her door against me because I told her that her father dined at our table," cried Rastignac.

Glances were exchanged all round the room; Old Goriot looked down.

"You have sent some snuff into my eye," he said to his neighbor, turning a little aside to rub his hand over his face.

"Any one who molests Old Goriot will have henceforward to reckon with me," said Eugène, looking at the old man's neighbor; "he is worth all the rest of us put together. I am not speaking of the ladies," he added, turning in the direction of Mlle. Taillefer.

Eugène's remarks produced a sensation, and his tone silenced the dinner table. Vautrin alone spoke. "If you are going to champion Old Goriot, and set up for his responsible editor into the bargain, you had need be a crack shot and know how to handle the foils," he said, banteringly.

"So I intend," said Eugène.

"Then you are taking the field today?"

"Perhaps," Rastignac answered. "But I owe no account of myself to any one, especially as I do not try to find out what other people do of a night."

Vautrin looked askance at Rastignac.

"If you do not mean to be deceived by the puppets, my boy, you must go behind and see the whole show, and not peep through holes in the curtain. That is enough," he added, seeing that Eugène was about to fly into a passion. "We can have a little talk whenever you like."

There was a general feeling of gloom and constraint. Old Goriot was so deeply dejected by the student's remark that he did not notice the change in the disposition of his fellow-lodgers, nor know that he had met with a champion capable of putting an end to the persecution.

"Then, M. Goriot sitting there is the father of a countess," said Mme. Vauquer in a low voice.

"And of a baroness," answered Rastignac.

"That is about all he is capable of," said Bianchon to Rastignac; "I have taken a look at his head; there is only one bump—the bump of Paternity; he must be an eternal father."

Eugène was too intent on his thoughts to laugh at Bianchon's joke. He determined to profit by Mme. de Beauséant's counsels, and was asking himself how he could obtain the necessary money. He grew grave. The wide savannas of the world stretched before his eyes; all things lay before him, nothing was his. Dinner came to an end, the others went, and he was left in the dining-room.

"So you have seen my daughter?" Goriot spoke tremulously, and the sound of his voice broke in upon Eugène's dreams. The young man took the elder's hand, and looked at him with something like kindness in his eyes.

"You are a good and noble man," he said. "We will have some talk about your daughters by and by."

He rose without waiting for Goriot's answer, and went to his room. There he wrote the following letter to his mother:





MY DEAR MOTHER. Can you nourish your child from your breast again? I am in a position to make a rapid fortune, but I want twelve hundred francs—I must have them at all costs. Say nothing about this to my father; perhaps he might make objections, and unless I have the money, I may be led to put an end to myself, and so escape the clutches of despair. I will tell you everything when I see you. I will not begin to try to describe my present situation; it would take volumes to put the whole story clearly and fully. I have not been gambling, my kind mother, I owe no one a penny; but if you would preserve the life that you gave me, you must send me the sum I mention. As a matter of fact, I go to see the Vicomtesse de Beauséant; she is using her influence for me; I am obliged to go into society, and I have not a penny to lay out on clean gloves. I can manage to exist on bread and water, or go without food, if need be, but I cannot do without the tools with which they cultivate the vineyards in this country. I must resolutely make up my mind at once to make my way, or stick in the mire for the rest of my days. I know that all your hopes are set on me, and I want to realize them quickly. Sell some of your old jewelry, my kind mother; I will give you other jewels very soon. I know enough of our affairs at home to know all that such a sacrifice means, and you must not think that I would lightly ask you to make it; I should be a monster if I could. You must think of my entreaty as a cry forced from me by imperative necessity. Our whole future lies in the subsidy with which I must begin my first campaign, for life in Paris is one continual battle. If you cannot otherwise procure the whole of the money, and are forced to sell our aunt's lace, tell her that I will send her some still handsomer,



and so forth.

He wrote to ask each of his sisters for their savings—would they despoil themselves for him, and keep the sacrifice a secret from the family? To his request he knew that they would not fail to respond gladly, and he added to it an appeal to their delicacy by touching the chord of honor that vibrates so loudly in young and highly strung natures.

Yet when he had written the letters, he could not help feeling misgivings in spite of his youthful ambition; his heart beat fast, and he trembled. He knew the spotless nobleness of the lives buried away in the lonely manor house; he knew what trouble and what joy his request would cause his sisters, and how happy they would be as they talked down in the orchard, of their dear brother in Paris. Visions rose before his eyes; a sudden strong light revealed his sisters secretly counting over their little store, devising some girlish stratagem by which the money could be sent to him incognito, essaying, for the first time in their lives, a piece of deceit that reached the sublime in its unselfishness.

"A sister's heart is a diamond for purity, a deep sea of tenderness!" he said to himself. He felt ashamed of those letters.

What power there must be in the petitions put up by such hearts; how pure the fervor that bears their souls to Heaven in prayer! What exquisite joy they would find in self-sacrifice! What a pang for his mother's heart if she could not send him all that he asked for! And this noble affection, these sacrifices made at such terrible cost, were to serve as the ladder by which he meant to climb to Delphine de Nucingen. A few tears, like the last grains of incense flung upon the sacred alter fire of the hearth, fell from his eyes. He walked up and down, and despair mingled with his emotion. Old Goriot saw him through the half-open door.

"What is the matter, sir?" he asked from the threshold.

"Ah! my good neighbor, I am as much a son and brother as you are a father. You do well to fear for the Comtesse Anastasie; there is one M. Maxime de Trailles, who will be her ruin."

Old Goriot withdrew, stammering some words, but Eugène failed to catch their meaning.

The next morning Rastignac went out to post his letters. Up to the last moment he wavered and doubted, but he ended by flinging them into the box. "I shall succeed!" he said to himself. So says the gambler; so says the great captain; but the three words that have been the salvation of some few, have been the ruin of many more.

A few days after this Eugène called at Mme. de Restaud's house; she was not at home. Three times he tried the experiment, and three times he found her doors closed against him, though he was careful to choose an hour when M. de Trailles was not there. The Vicomtesse was right.

The student studied no longer. He put in an appearance at lectures simply to answer to his name, and after thus attesting his presence, departed forthwith. He had been through a reasoning process familiar to most students. He had seen the advisability of deferring his studies to the last moment before going up for his examinations; he made up his mind to cram his second and third years' work into the third year, when he meant to begin to work in earnest, and to complete his studies in law with one great effort. In the meantime he had fifteen months in which to navigate the ocean of Paris, to spread the nets and set the lines that should bring him a protectress and a fortune. Twice during that week he saw Mme. de Beauséant; he did not go to her house until he had seen the Marquis d'Ajuda drive away.

Victory for yet a few more days was with the great lady, the most poetic figure in the Faubourg Saint-Germain; and the marriage of the Marquis d'Ajuda-Pinto with Mlle. de Rochefide was postponed. The dread of losing her happiness filled those days with a fever of joy unknown before, but the end was only so much the nearer. The Marquis d'Ajuda and the Rochefides agreed that this quarrel and reconciliation was a very fortunate thing; Mme. de Beauséant (so they hoped) would gradually become reconciled to the idea of the marriage, and in the end would be brought to sacrifice d'Ajuda's morning visits to the exigencies of a man's career, exigencies which she must have foreseen. In spite of the most solemn promises, daily renewed, M. d'Ajuda was playing a part, and the Vicomtesse was eager to be deceived. "Instead of taking a leap heroically from the window, she is falling headlong down the staircase," said her most intimate friend, the Duchesse de Langeais. Yet this after-glow of happiness lasted long enough for the Vicomtesse to be of service to her young cousin. She had a half-superstitious affection for him. Eugène had shown her sympathy and devotion at a crisis when a woman sees no pity, no real comfort in any eyes; when if a man is ready with soothing flatteries, it is because he has an interested motive.

Rastignac made up his mind that he must learn the whole of Goriot's previous history; he would come to his bearings before attempting to board the Maison de Nucingen. The results of his inquiries may be given briefly as follows:

In the days before the Revolution, Jean-Joachim Goriot was simply a workman in the employ of a vermicelli-maker. He was a skilful, thrifty workman, sufficiently enterprising to buy his master's business when the latter fell a chance victim to the disturbances of 1789. Goriot established himself in the Rue de la Jussienne, close to the Corn Exchange. His plain good sense led him to accept the position of President of the Section, so as to secure for his business the protection of those in power at that dangerous epoch. This prudent step had led to success; the foundations of his fortune were laid in the time of the Scarcity (real or artificial), when the price of grain of all kinds rose enormously in Paris. People used to fight for bread at the bakers' doors; while other persons went to the grocers' shops and bought Italian paste foods without brawling over it. It was during this year that citizen Goriot made the money which, at a later time, was to give him all the advantage of the great capitalist over the small buyer; he had, moreover, the usual luck of average ability; his mediocrity was the salvation of him. He excited no one's envy, it was not even suspected that he was rich till the peril of being rich was over, and all his intelligence was concentrated, not on political, but on commercial speculations. Goriot was an authority second to none on all questions relating to corn, flour, and "middlings"; and the production, storage, and quality of grain. He could estimate the yield of the harvest, and foresee market prices; he bought his cereals in Sicily, and imported Russian wheat. Any one who had heard him hold forth on the regulations that control the importation and exportation of grain, who had seen his grasp of the subject, his clear insight into the principles involved, his appreciation of weak points in the way that the system worked, would have thought that here was the stuff of which a minister is made. Patient, active, and persevering, energetic and prompt in action, he surveyed his business horizon with an eagle's eye. Nothing there took him by surprise; he foresaw all things, knew all that was happening, and kept his own counsel; he was a diplomatist in his quick comprehension of a situation; and in the routine of business he was as patient and plodding as a soldier on the march. But beyond this business horizon he could not see. He used to spend his hours of leisure on the threshold of his shop, leaning against the framework of the door. Take him from his dark little counting-house, and he became once more the rough, slow-witted workman, a man who cannot understand a piece of reasoning, who is indifferent to all intellectual pleasures, and falls asleep at the play, a Parisian Dolibom in short, against whose stupidity other minds are powerless.

Natures of this kind are nearly all alike; in almost all of them you will find some hidden depth of sublime affection. Two all-absorbing affections filled the vermicelli-maker's heart to the exclusion of every other feeling; into them he seemed to put all the forces of his nature, as he put the whole power of his brain into the corn trade. He had regarded his wife, the only daughter of a rich farmer of La Brie, with a devout admiration; his love for her had been boundless. Goriot had felt the charm of a lovely and sensitive nature, which, in its delicate strength, was the very opposite of his own. Is there any instinct more deeply implanted in the heart of man than the pride of protection, a protection which is constantly exerted for a fragile and defenceless creature? Join love thereto, the warmth of gratitude that all generous souls feel for the source of their pleasures, and you have the explanation of many strange incongruities in human nature.

After seven years of unclouded happiness, Goriot lost his wife. It was very unfortunate for him. She was beginning to gain an ascendency over him in other ways; possibly she might have brought that barren soil under cultivation, she might have widened his ideas and given other directions to his thoughts. But when she was dead, the instinct of fatherhood developed in him till it almost became a mania. All the affection balked by death seemed to turn to his daughters, and he found full satisfaction for his heart in loving them. More or less brilliant proposals were made to him from time to time; wealthy merchants or farmers with daughters vied with each other in offering inducements to him to marry again; but he determined to remain a widower. His father-in-law, the only man for whom he felt a decided friendship, gave out that Goriot had made a vow to be faithful to his wife's memory. The frequenters of the Corn Exchange, who could not comprehend this sublime piece of folly, joked about it among themselves, and found a ridiculous nickname for him. One of them ventured (after a glass over a bargain) to call him by it, and a blow from the vermicelli-maker's fist sent him headlong into a gutter in the Rue Oblin. He could think of nothing else when his children were concerned; his love for them made him fidgety and anxious; and this was so well known, that one day a competitor, who wished to get rid of him to secure the field to himself, told Old Goriot that Delphine had just been knocked down by a cab. The vermicelli-maker turned ghastly pale, left the Exchange at once, and did not return for several days afterwards; he was ill in consequence of the shock and the subsequent relief on discovering that it was a false alarm. This time, however, the offender did not escape with a bruised shoulder; at a critical moment in the man's affairs, Goriot drove him into bankruptcy, and forced him to disappear from the Corn Exchange.

As might have been expected, the two girls were spoiled. With an income of sixty thousand francs, Goriot scarcely spent twelve hundred on himself, and found all his happiness in satisfying the whims of the two girls. The best masters were engaged, that Anastasie and Delphine might be endowed with all the accomplishments which distinguish a good education. They had a chaperon—luckily for them, she was a woman who had sense and good taste; they learned to ride; they had a carriage for their use; they lived as the mistress of a rich old lord might live; they had only to express a wish, their father would hasten to grant them their most extravagant desires, and asked nothing of them in return but a kiss. Goriot had raised the two girls to the level of the angels; and, quite naturally, he himself was left beneath them. Poor man! he loved them even for the pain that they gave him.

When the girls were old enough to be married, they were left free to choose for themselves. Each had half her father's fortune as her dowry; and when the Comte de Restaud came to woo Anastasie for her beauty, her social aspirations led her to leave her father's house for a more exalted sphere. Delphine wished for money; she married Nucingen, a banker of German extraction, who became a Baron of the Holy Roman Empire. Goriot remained a vermicelli-maker as before. His daughters and his sons-in-law began to demur; they did not like to see him still engaged in trade, though his whole life was bound up with his business. For five years he stood out against their entreaties, then he yielded, and consented to retire on the amount realized by the sale of his business and the savings of the last few years. It was this capital that Mme. Vauquer, in the early days of his residence with her, had calculated would bring in eight or ten thousand livres in a year. He had taken refuge in her lodging-house, driven there by despair when he knew that his daughters were compelled by their husbands not only to refuse to receive him as an inmate in their houses, but even to see him no more except in private.

This was all the information which Rastignac gained from a M. Muret who had purchased Goriot's business, information which confirmed the Duchesse de Langeais' suppositions, and herewith the preliminary explanation of this obscure but terrible Parisian tragedy comes to an end.

Towards the end of the first week in December Rastignac received two letters——one from his mother, and one from his eldest sister. His heart beat fast, half with happiness, half with fear, at the sight of the familiar handwriting. Those two little scraps of paper contained life or death for his hopes. But while he felt a shiver of dread as he remembered their dire poverty at home, he knew their love for him so well that he could not help fearing that he was draining their very life-blood. His mother's letter ran as follows:


MY DEAR CHILD. I am sending you the money that you asked for. Make a good use of it. Even to save your life I could not raise so large a sum a second time without your father's knowledge, and there would be trouble about it. We should be obliged to mortgage the land. It is impossible to judge of the merits of schemes of which I am ignorant; but what sort of schemes can they be, that you should fear to tell me about them? Volumes of explanation would not have been needed; we mothers can understand at a word, and that word would have spared me the anguish of uncertainty. I do not know how to hide the painful impression that your letter has made upon me, my dear son. What can you have felt when you were moved to send this chill of dread through my heart? It must have been very painful to you to write the letter that gave me so much pain as I read it. To what courses are you committed? You are going to appear to be something that you are not, and your whole life and success depends upon this? You are about to see a society into which you cannot enter without rushing into expense that you cannot afford, without losing precious time that is needed for your studies? Ah! my dear Eugène, believe your mother, crooked ways cannot lead to great ends. Patience and endurance are the two qualities most needed in your position. I am not scolding you; I do not want any tinge of bitterness to spoil our offering. I am only talking like a mother whose trust in you is as great as her foresight for you. You know the steps that you must take, and I, for my part, know your purity of heart, and how good your intentions are; so I can say to you without a doubt: "Go forward, beloved!" If I tremble, it is because I am a mother, but my prayers and blessings will be with you at every step. Be very careful, dear boy. You must have a man's prudence, for it lies with you to shape the destinies of five others who are dear to you, and must look to you. Yes, our fortunes depend upon you, and your success is ours. We all pray to God to be with you in all that you do. Your aunt Marcillac has been most generous beyond words in this matter; she saw at once how it was, even down to your gloves. "But I have a weakness for the eldest!" she said gaily. You must love your aunt very much, dear Eugène. I shall wait till you have succeeded before telling you all that she has done for you, or her money would burn your fingers. You, who are young, do not know what it is to part with something that is a piece of your past! But what would we not sacrifice for your sakes? Your aunt says that I am to send you a kiss on the forehead from her, and that kiss is to bring you luck again and again, she says. She would have written you herself, the dear kind-hearted woman, but she is troubled with the gout in her fingers just now. Your father is very well. The vintage of 1819 has turned out better than we expected. Good-bye, dear boy; I will say nothing about your sisters, because Laure is writing to you, and I must let her have the pleasure of giving you all the home news. Heaven send that you may succeed! Oh! yes, dear Eugène, you must succeed. I have come, through you, to a knowledge of a pain so sharp that I do not think I could endure it a second time. I have come to know what it is to be poor, and to long for money for my children's sake. There, good-bye! Do not leave us for long without news of you; and here, at the last, receive a kiss from your mother.



By the time Eugène had finished the letter he was in tears. He thought of Old Goriot crushing his silver keepsake into a shapeless mass before he sold it to meet his daughter's bill of exchange.

"Your mother has broken up her jewels for you," he said to himself; "your aunt shed tears over those relics of hers before she sold them for your sake. What right have you to heap execrations on Anastasie? You have followed her example; you have selfishly sacrificed others to your own future, and she sacrifices her father to her lover; and of you two, which is the worse?"

He was ready to renounce his attempts; he could not bear to take that money. The fires of remorse burned in his heart, and gave him intolerable pain, the generous secret remorse which men seldom take into account when they sit in judgment upon their fellow-men; but perhaps the angels in heaven, beholding it, pardon the criminal whom our justice condemns. Rastignac opened his sister's letter; its simplicity and kindness revived his heart.


Your letter came just at the right time, dear brother. Agathe and I had thought of so many different ways of spending our money that we did not know what to buy with it; and now you have come in, and, like the servant who upset all the watches that belonged to the King of Spain, you have restored harmony; for, really and truly, we did not know which of all the things we wanted we wanted most, and we were always quarreling about it, never thinking, dear Eugène, of a way of spending our money which would satisfy us completely. Agathe jumped for joy. Indeed, we have been like two mad things all day, "to such a prodigious degree" (as aunt would say), that mother said, with her severe expression, "Whatever can be the matter with you, mesdemoiselles?" I think if we had been scolded a little, we should have been still better pleased. A woman ought to be very glad to suffer for one she loves! I, however, in my inmost soul, was doleful and cross in the midst of all my joy. I shall make a bad wife, I am afraid, I am too fond of spending. I had bought two sashes and a nice little stiletto for piercing eyelet-holes in my stays, trifles that I really did not want, so that I have less than that slow-coach Agathe, who is so economical, and hoards her money like a magpie. She had two hundred francs! And I have only one hundred and fifty! I am nicely punished! I could throw my sash down the well; it will be painful to me to wear it now. Poor dear, I have robbed you. And Agathe was so nice about it. She said, ‘Let us send the three hundred and fifty francs in our two names!' But I could not help telling you everything just as it happened.

Do you know how we managed to keep your commandments? We took our glittering hoard, we went out for a walk, and when once fairly on the highway we ran all the way to Ruffec, where we handed over the coin, without more ado, to M. Grimbert of the Royal. Mail Coaches. We came back again like swallows on the wing. "Don't you think that happiness has made us lighter?' Agathe said. We said all sorts of things, which I shall not tell you, Monsieur le Parisien, because they were all about you. Oh, we love you dearly, dear brother; it was all summed up in those few words. As for keeping the secret, little masqueraders like us are capable of anything (according to our aunt), even of holding our tongues. Our mother has been on a mysterious journey to Angoulême, and the aunt went with her, not without solemn councils, from which we were shut out, and M. le Baron likewise. They are silent as to the weighty political considerations that prompted their mission, and conjectures are rife in the State of Rastignac. The Infantas are embroidering a muslin robe with open-work sprigs for her Majesty the Queen; the work progresses in the most profound secrecy. There be but two more breadths to finish. A decree has gone forth that no wall shall be built on the side of Verteuil, but that a hedge shall be planted instead thereof. Our subjects may sustain some disappointment of fruit and espaliers, but strangers will enjoy a fair prospect. Should the heir-presumptive lack pocket-handkerchiefs, be it known unto him that the dowager Lady of Marcillac, exploring the recesses of her treasures and boxes (known respectively as Pompeii and Herculaneum), having brought to light a fair piece of cambric whereof she wotted not, the Princesses Agathe and Laure place at their brother's disposal their thread, their needles, and hands somewhat of the reddest. The two young Princes, Don Henri and Don Gabriel, retain their fatal habits of stuffing themselves with grape-jelly, of teasing their sisters, of not learning anything, of taking their pleasure by going a-birdnesting, and of cutting switches for themselves from the osier-beds, maugre the laws of the realm. Moreover, they list not to learn aught, wherefore the Papal Nuncio (called of the commonalty, M. le Curé) threateneth them with excommunication, since that they neglect the sacred canons of grammatical construction for the construction of other canon, deadly engines made of the stems of elder.

Farewell, dear brother, never did letter carry so many wishes for your success, so much love fully satisfied. You will have a great deal to tell us when you come home! You will tell me everything, won't you? I am the oldest. From something the aunt let fall, we think you must have had some success.

Something was said of a lady, but nothing more was said...

Of course not, in our family! Oh, by the by, Eugène, would you rather that we made that piece of cambric into shirts for you instead of pocket-handkerchiefs? If you want some really nice shirts at once, we ought to lose no time in beginning upon them; and if the fashion is different now in Paris, send us one for a pattern; we want more particularly to know about the cuffs. Good-bye! Good-bye! Take my kiss on the left side of your forehead, on the temple that belongs to me, and to no one else in the world. I am leaving the other side of the sheet for Agathe, who has solemnly promised not to read a word that I have written; but, all the same, I mean to sit by her while she writes, so as to be quite sure that she keeps her word. Your loving sister,

LAURE DE RASTIGNAC.



"Yes!" said Eugène to himself. "Yes! Success at all costs now! Riches could not repay such devotion as this. I wish I could give them every sort of happiness! Fifteen hundred and fifty francs," he went on after a pause. "Every shot must go to the mark! Laure is right. Trust a woman! I have only calico shirts. Where someone else's welfare is concerned, a young girl becomes as ingenious as a thief. Guileless where she herself is in question, and full of foresight for me—she is like a heavenly angel forgiving the strange incomprehensible sins of earth."

The world lay before him. His tailor had been summoned and sounded, and had finally surrendered. When Rastignac met M. de Trailles, he had seen at once how great a part the tailor plays in a young man's career; a tailor is either a deadly enemy or a staunch friend, with an invoice for a bond of friendship; between these two extremes there is, alack! no middle term. In this representative of his craft Eugène discovered a man who understood that his was a sort of paternal function for young men at their entrance into life, who regarded himself as a stepping-stone between a young man's present and future. And Rastignac in gratitude made the man's fortune by an epigram of a kind in which he excelled at a later period of his life.

"I have twice known a pair of trousers turned out by him make a match of twenty thousand livres a year!"

Fifteen hundred francs, and as many suits of clothes as he chose to order! At that moment the poor child of the South felt no more doubts of any kind. The young man went down to breakfast with the indefinable air which the consciousness of the possession of money gives to youth. No sooner are the coins slipped into a student's pocket than his wealth, in imagination at least, is piled into a fantastic column, which affords him a moral support. He begins to hold up his head as he walks; he is conscious that he has a means of bringing his powers to bear on a given point; he looks you straight in the face; his gestures are quick and decided; only yesterday he was diffident and shy, any one might have pushed him aside; to-morrow, he will take the wall of a prime minister. A miracle has been wrought in him. Nothing is beyond the reach of his ambition, and his ambition soars at random; he is light-hearted, generous, and enthusiastic; in short, the fledgling bird has discovered that he has wings. A poor student snatches at every chance pleasure much as a dog runs all sorts of risks to steal a bone, cracking it and sucking the marrow as he flies from pursuit; but a young man who can rattle a few runaway gold coins in his pocket can take his pleasure deliberately, can taste the whole of the sweets of secure possession; he soars far above earth; he has forgotten what the word poverty means; all Paris is his. Those are days when the whole world shines radiant with light, when everything glows and sparkles before the eyes of youth, days that bring joyous energy that is never brought into harness, days of debts and of painful fears that go hand in hand with every delight. Those who do not know the left bank of the Seine between the Rue Saint-Jacques and the Rue des Saints-Pères know nothing of life.

"Ah! if the women of Paris but knew," said Rastignac, as he devoured Mme. Vauquer's stewed pears (at five for a penny), "they would come here in search of a lover."

Just then a porter from the Royal Mails appeared at the door of the room; they had previously heard the bell ring as the wicket opened to admit him. The man asked for M. Eugène de Rastignac, holding out two bags for him to take, and a form of receipt for his signature. Vautrin's keen glance cut Eugène like a lash.

"Now you will be able to pay for those fencing lessons and go to the shooting gallery," he said.

"Your ship has come in," said Mme. Vauquer, eyeing the bags.

Mlle. Michonneau did not dare to look at the money, for fear her eyes should betray her cupidity.

"You have a kind mother," said Mme. Couture.

"You have a kind mother, sir," echoed Poiret.

"Yes, mamma has been bled," said Vautrin, "and now you can kick up your heels, go into society, and fish for heiresses, and dance with countesses who have peach blossom in their hair. But take my advice, young man, and keep up your pistol practice."

Vautrin struck an attitude, as if he were facing an antagonist. Rastignac, meaning to give the porter a tip, felt in his pockets and found nothing. Vautrin flung down a franc piece on the table.

"Your credit is good," he remarked, eyeing the student, and Rastignac was forced to thank him, though, since the sharp encounter of wits at dinner that day, after Eugène came in from calling on Mme. de Beauséant, he had made up his mind that Vautrin was insufferable. For a week, in fact, they had both kept silence in each other's presence, and watched each other. The student tried in vain to account to himself for this attitude.

An idea, of course, gains in force by the energy with which it is expressed; it strikes where the brain sends it, by a law as mathematically exact as the law that determines the course of a shell from a mortar. The amount of impression it makes is not to be determined so exactly. Sometimes, in tender souls, the idea works havoc, but there are, no less, natures so robustly protected, that this sort of projectile falls flat and harmless on skulls of triple brass, as cannon-shot against solid masonry; then there are flaccid and spongy-fibred natures into which ideas from without sink like spent bullets into the earthworks of a redoubt. Rastignac's head was filled with explosive material, ready to ignite at the least touch. He was too quick, too young, not to be readily accessible to ideas; and open to that subtle influence of thought and feeling in others which causes so many strange phenomena that make an impression upon us of which we are all unconscious at the time. Nothing escaped his mental vision; he was lynx-eyed; in him the mental powers of perception, which seem like duplicates of the senses, had the mysterious power of swift projection that astonishes us in intellects of a high order—slingers who are quick to detect the weak spot in any armor.

In the past month Eugène's good qualities and defects had rapidly developed with his character. Intercourse with the world and the endeavor to satisfy his growing desires had brought out his defects. But Rastignac came from the south side of the Loire, and had the good qualities of his countrymen. He had the impetuous courage of the South, that rushes to the attack of a difficulty, as well as the southern impatience of delay or suspense. These traits are held to be defects in the North; they made the fortune of Murat, but they likewise cut short his career. The moral would appear to be that when the dash and boldness of the south side of the Loire meets, in a southern temperament, with the guile of the North, the character is complete, and such a man will gain (and keep) the crown of Sweden.

Rastignac, therefore, could not stand the fire from Vautrin's batteries for long without discovering whether this was a friend or a foe. He felt as if this strange being was reading his inmost soul, and dissecting his feelings, while Vautrin himself was so close and secretive that he seemed to have something of the profound and unmoved serenity of a sphinx, seeing and hearing all things and saying nothing. Eugène, conscious of that money in his pocket, grew rebellious.

"Be so good as to wait a moment," he said to Vautrin, as the latter rose, after slowly emptying his coffee-cup, sip by sip.

"What for?" inquired the older man, as he put on his large-brimmed hat and took up the sword-cane that he was wont to twirl like a man who will face three or four footpads without flinching.

"I will repay you in a minute," returned Eugène. He unsealed one of the bags as he spoke, counted out a hundred and forty francs, and pushed them towards Mme. Vauquer. "Short reckonings make good friends" he added, turning to the widow; "that clears our accounts till the end of the year. Can you give me change for a five-franc piece?"

"Good friends make short reckonings," echoed Poiret, with a glance at Vautrin.

"Here is your franc," said Rastignac, holding out the coin to the sphinx in the black wig.

"Any one might think that you were afraid to owe me a trifle," exclaimed this latter, with a searching glance that seemed to read the young man's inmost thoughts; there was a satirical and cynical smile on Vautrin's face such as Eugène had seen scores of times already; every time he saw it, it exasperated him almost beyond endurance.

"Well... so I am," he answered. He held both the bags in his hand, and had risen to go up to his room.

Vautrin made as if he were going out through the sitting-room, and the student turned to go through the second door that opened into the square lobby at the foot of the staircase.

"Do you know, M. le Marquis de Rastignacorama, that what you were saying just now was not exactly polite?" Vautrin remarked, as he rattled his sword-cane across the panels of the sitting-room door, and came up to the student.

Rastignac looked coolly at Vautrin, drew him to the foot of the staircase, and shut the dining-room door. They were standing in the little square lobby between the kitchen and the dining-room; the place was lighted by an iron-barred fanlight above a door that gave access into the garden. Sylvie came out of her kitchen, and Eugène chose that moment to say:

"Monsieur Vautrin, I am not a marquis, and my name is not Rastignacorama."

"They will fight," said Mlle. Michonneau, in an indifferent tone.

"Fight!" echoed Poiret.

"Not they," replied Mme. Vauquer, lovingly fingering her pile of coins.

"But there they are under the lime-trees," cried Mlle. Victorine, who had risen so that she might see out into the garden. "Poor young man! he was in the right, after all."

"We must go upstairs, my pet," said Mme. Couture; "it is no business of ours."

At the door, however, Mme. Couture and Victorine found their progress barred by the portly form of Sylvie the cook.

"Whatever can have happened?" she said. "M. Vautrin said to M. Eugène, 'Let us have an explanation!' Then he took him by the arm, and there they are, out among the artichokes."

Vautrin came in while she was speaking. "Mamma Vauquer," he said smiling, "don't frighten yourself at all. I am only going to try my pistols under the lime-trees."

"Oh! monsieur," cried Victorine, clasping her hands as she spoke, "why do you want to kill M. Eugène?"

Vautrin stepped back a pace or two, and gazed at Victorine.

"Oh! Here's something else to think about!" he exclaimed in a jeering tone, that brought the color into the poor girl's face. "That young fellow yonder is very nice, isn't he?" he went on. "You have given me a notion, my pretty child; I will make you both happy."

Mme. Couture laid her hand on the arm of her ward, and drew the girl away, as she said in her ear:

"Why, Victorine, I cannot imagine what has come over you this morning."

"I don't want any shots fired in my garden," said Mme. Vauquer. "You will frighten the neighborhood and bring the police up here all in a moment."

"Come, keep cool, Mamma Vauquer," answered Vautrin. "There, there; it's all right; we will go to the shooting-gallery."

He went back to Rastignac, laying his hand familiarly on the young man's arm.

"When I have given you ocular demonstration of the fact that I can put a bullet through the ace of spades five times running at thirty-five paces," he said, "that won't take away your appetite, I suppose? You look to me to be inclined to be a trifle quarrelsome this morning, and as if you would be fool enough to let me kill you."

"Do you draw back?" asked Eugène.

"Don't irritate me," answered Vautrin, "it is not cold this morning. Let us go and sit over there," he added, pointing to the green-painted garden seats; "no one can overhear us. I want a little talk with you. You are not a bad sort of youngster, and I have no quarrel with you. I like you, take Trump—(damn it!)—take Vautrin's word for it. What makes me like you? I will tell you by and by. Meantime, I can tell you that I know you as well as if I had made you myself, as I will prove to you in a minute. Put down your bags," he continued, pointing to the round table.

Rastignac deposited his money on the table, and sat down. He was consumed with curiosity, which the sudden change in the manner of the man before him had excited to the highest pitch. Here was a strange being who, a moment ago, had talked of killing him, and now posed as his protector.

"You would like to know who I really am, what I was, and what I do now," Vautrin went on. "You want to know too much, youngster. Come! come! keep cool! You will hear more astonishing things than that. I have had my misfortunes. Just hear me out first, and you shall have your turn afterwards. Here is my past in three words. Who am I? Vautrin. What do I do? Just what I please. Let us change the subject. You want to know my character. I am good-natured to those who do me a good turn, or to those whose hearts speak to mine. These last may do anything they like with me; they may bruise my shins, and I shall not tell them to ‘mind what they are about'; but, by God! the devil himself is not an uglier customer than I can be if people annoy me, or if I don't happen to take to them; and you may just as well know at once that I think no more of killing a man than of that," and he spat before him as he spoke. "Only when it is absolutely necessary to do so, I do my best to kill him properly. I am what you call an artist. I have read Benvenuto Cellini's Memoirs, such as you see me; and, what is more, in Italian! A fine-spirited fellow he was! From him I learned to follow the example set us by Providence, who strikes us down at random, and to admire the beautiful whenever and wherever it is found. And, setting other questions aside, is it not a glorious part to play, when you pit yourself against mankind, and the luck is on your side? I have thought a good deal about the constitution of your present social Disorder. A duel is downright childish, my boy! utter nonsense and folly! When one of two living men must be got out of the way, none but an idiot would leave chance to decide which it is to be; and in a duel it is a toss-up—heads or tails—and there you are! Now I, for instance, can hit the ace in the middle of a card five times running, send one bullet after another through the same hole, and at thirty-five paces, moreover! With that little accomplishment you might think yourself certain of killing your man, mightn't you? Well, I have fired, at twenty paces, and missed, and the rogue who had never handled a pistol in his life—look here!" He unbuttoned his waistcoat and exposed his chest, covered, like a bear's back, with a shaggy, reddish fell; the student gave a startled shudder. "The greenhorn scratched me here," said the extraordinary man, drawing Rastignac's fingers over a deep scar on his breast. "But that happened when I myself was a mere boy; I was one-and-twenty then (your age), and I had some beliefs left—in a woman's love, and in a pack of rubbish that you will be over head and ears in directly. You and I were to have fought just now, weren't we? You might have killed me. Suppose that I were put under the earth, where would you be? You would have to clear out of this, go to Switzerland, draw on papa's purse—and he has none too much in it as it is. I mean to open your eyes to your real position, that is what I am going to do: but I shall do it from the point of view of a man who, after studying the world very closely, sees that there are but two alternatives—stupid obedience or revolt. I obey nobody; is that clear? Now, do you know how much you will want at the pace you are going? A million; and promptly, too, or that little head of yours will be swaying to and fro in the drag-nets at Saint-Cloud, while we are gone to find out whether or no there is a Supreme Being. I can give you that million."

He stopped for a moment and looked at Eugène.

"Aha! you are not so cross with Papa Vautrin now! At the mention of the million you look like a young girl when somebody has said, ‘I will come for you this evening!' and she tricks herselfout. All right. Come, now, let us go into the question, young man; all between ourselves, you know. We have a papa and mamma down yonder, a great-aunt, two sisters (aged eighteen and seventeen), two young brothers (one fifteen, and the other ten), that is about the roll-call of the crew. The aunt brings up the two sisters; the curé comes and teaches the boys Latin. Boiled chestnuts are oftener on the table than white bread. Papa makes a suit of clothes last a long while; if mamma has a different dress winter and summer, it is about as much as she has; the sisters manage as best they can. I know all about it; I have lived in the South.

"That is how things are at home. They send you twelve hundred francs a year, and the whole property only brings in three thousand francs all told. We have a cook and a manservant; papa is a baron, and we must keep up appearances. Then we have our ambitions; we are connected with the Beauséants, and we go afoot through the streets; we want to be rich, and we have not a penny; we eat Mme. Vauquer's messes, and we like grand dinners in the Faubourg Saint-Germain; we sleep on a cheap cot bed, and dream of a mansion! I do not blame you for wanting these things. What sort of men do the women run after? Men of ambition. Men of ambition have stronger frames, their blood is richer in iron, their hearts are warmer than those of ordinary men. Women feel that when their power is greatest, they look their best, and that those are their happiest hours; they like power in men, and prefer the strongest even if it is a power that may be their own destruction. I am going to make an inventory of your desires in order to put the question at issue before you. Here it is:

"We are as hungry as a wolf, and those newly-cut teeth of ours are sharp; what are we to do to keep the pot boiling? In the first place, we have the Code to browse upon; it is not amusing, and we are none the wiser for it, but that cannot be helped. So far so good. We mean to make an advocate of ourselves with a prospect of one day being made president of a Court of Assize, when we shall send poor devils, our betters, to the galleys with a T. F.[1] branded on their shoulders, so that the rich may be convinced that they can sleep in peace. There is no fun in that; and you are a long while coming to it; for, to begin with, there are two years of hanging around in Paris, we see all the lollipops that we long for out of our reach. It is tiresome to want things and never to have them. If you were a pallid creature of the mollusk order, you would have nothing to fear, but it is different when you have the hot blood of a lion and are ready to get into a dozen scrapes every day of your life. This is the ghastliest form of torture known in this inferno of God's making, and you will give in to it. Or suppose that you are a good boy, drink nothing stronger than milk, and write your verses; you, with your generous nature, will endure hardships that would drive a dog mad, and make a start, after long waiting, as deputy to some rascal or other in a hole of a place where the government will fling you a thousand francs a year like the scraps that are thrown to the butcher's dog. Bark at thieves, plead the cause of the rich, send men of heart to the guillotine, that is your work! Many thanks! If you have no influence, you may rot in your provincial tribunal. At thirty you will be a justice with twelve hundred francs a year (if you have not flung off the gown for good before then). By the time you are forty you may marry a miller's daughter, an heiress with some six thousand livres a year. Much obliged! If you have influence, you may possibly be a public prosecutor by the time you are thirty; with a salary of a thousand crowns, you could marry the mayor's daughter. Some petty piece of political trickery, such as mistaking Villèle for Manuel in a bulletin (the names rhyme, and that quiets your conscience), and you will probably be a Attorney General by the time you are forty, with a chance of becoming a deputy. Please observe, my dear boy, that our conscience will have been a little damaged in the process, and that we shall have endured twenty years of drudgery and hidden poverty, and that our sisters will have become old maids. I have the honor to call your attention to another fact: to wit, that there are but twenty Procureurs Généraux at a time in all France, while there are some twenty thousand of you young men who aspire to that elevated position; that there are some mountebanks among you who would sell their family to screw their fortunes a peg higher. If this sort of thing sickens you, try another course. The Baron de Rastignac thinks of becoming an advocate, does he? There's a nice prospect for you! Ten years of drudgery straight away. You are obliged to live at the rate of a thousand francs a month; you must have a library of law books, live in chambers, go into society, go down on your knees to ask a solicitor for briefs, lick the dust off the floor of the Palais de Justice. If this kind of business led to anything, I should not say no; but just give me the names of five advocates here in Paris who by the time that they are fifty are making fifty thousand francs a year! Bah! I would sooner turn pirate on the high seas than have my soul shrivel up inside me like that. How will you find the capital? There is but one way, marry a woman who has money. There is no fun in it. Have you a mind to marry? You hang a stone around your neck; for if you marry for money, what becomes of our exalted notions of honor and so forth? You might as well fly in the face of social conventions at once. Is it nothing to crawl like a serpent before your wife, to lick her mother's feet, to descend to dirty actions that would sicken swine—faugh!—never mind if you at least make your fortune. But you will be as doleful as a dripstone if you marry for money. It is better to wrestle with men than to wrangle at home with your wife. You are at the crossway of the roads of life, my boy; choose your way.

"But you have chosen already. You have gone to see your cousin de Beauséant, and you have sniffed at luxury; you have been to Mme. de Restaud's house, and in Old Goriot's daughter you have sniffed the Parisienne for the first time. That day you came back with a word written upon your forehead. I knew it, I could read it—'success!' Yes, Success at any price. 'Bravo,' said I to myself, 'here is the sort of fellow for me.' You wanted money. Where was it to come from? You have drained your sisters' little hoards (all brothers sponge more or less on their sisters). Those fifteen hundred francs of yours (got together, God knows how! in a country where there are more chestnuts than five-franc pieces) will slip away like soldiers after pillage. And, then, what will you do? Shall you begin to work? Work, or what you understand by work at this moment, means, for a man of Poiret's calibre, an old age in Mamma Vauquer's lodging-house. There are fifty thousand young men in your position at this moment, all bent as you are on solving one and the same problem—how to acquire a fortune rapidly. You are but a unit in that aggregate. You can guess, therefore, what efforts you must make, how desperate the struggle is. There are not fifty thousand good positions for you; you must fight and devour one another like spiders in a pot. Do you know how a man makes his way here? By brilliant genius or by skillful corruption. You must either cut your way through these masses of men like a cannon-ball, or slink through like a plague. Honesty is nothing to the purpose. Men bow before the power of genius; they hate it, and try to slander it, because genius does not divide the spoil; but if genius persists, they bow before it. To sum it all up in a phrase, if they fail to smother genius in the mud, they fall on their knees and worship it. Corruption is a great power in the world, and talent is scarce. So corruption is the weapon of superfluous mediocrity; you will be made to feel the point of it everywhere. You will see women who spend more than ten thousand francs a year on dress, while their husband's salary (his whole income) is six thousand francs. You will see officials buying estates on twelve thousand francs a year. You will see women who sell themselves body and soul to drive in a carriage belonging to the son of a peer of France, who has a right to drive in the middle rank at Longchamp. You have seen that poor idiot Goriot obliged to meet a bill with his daughter's name at the back of it, though her husband has fifty thousand francs a year. I defy you to walk a couple of yards anywhere in Paris without stumbling on some infernal complication. I'll bet my head to a head of that salad that you will stir up a hornet's nest by taking a fancy to the first young, rich, and pretty woman you meet. They are all dodging the law, all at loggerheads with their husbands. If I were to begin to tell you all that vanity or necessity (virtue is not often mixed up in it, you may be sure), all that vanity and necessity drive them to do for lovers, finery, housekeeping, or children, I should never come to an end. So an honest man is the common enemy.

"But do you know what an honest man is? Here, in Paris, an honest man is the man who keeps his own counsel, and will not divide the plunder. I am not speaking now of those poor bond-slaves who do the work of the world without a reward for their toil—God Almighty's outcasts, I call them. Among them, I grant you, is virtue in all the flower of its stupidity, but poverty is no less their portion. At this moment, I think I see the long faces those good folk would pull if God played a practical joke on them and stayed away at the Last Judgment.

"Well, then, if you mean to make a fortune quickly, you must either be rich to begin with, or make people believe that you are rich. It is no use playing here except for high stakes; once take to low play, it is all up with you. If in the scores of professions that are open to you, there are ten men who rise very rapidly, people are sure to call them thieves. You can draw your own conclusions. Such is life. It is no cleaner than a kitchen; it reeks like a kitchen; and if you mean to cook your dinner, you must expect to soil your hands; the real art is in getting them clean again, and therein lies the whole morality of our epoch. If I take this tone in speaking of the world to you, I have the right to do so; I know it well. Do you think that I am blaming it? Far from it; the world has always been as it is now. Moralists' strictures will never change it. Mankind is not perfect, but one age is more or less hypocritical than another, and then simpletons say that its morality is high or low. I do not think that the rich are any worse than the poor; man is much the same, high or low, or wherever he is. In a million of these human cattle there may be half a score of bold spirits who rise above the rest, above the laws; I am one of them. And you, if you are cleverer than your fellows, make straight to your end, and hold your head high. Still you will have to fight against envy and slander and mediocrity, and the whole world. Napoleon met with a Minister of War, Aubry by name, who all but sent him to the colonies.

"Feel your pulse. Think whether you can get up morning after morning, strengthened in yesterday's purpose. In that case I will make you an offer that no one would decline. Listen attentively. You see, I have an idea of my own. My idea is to live a patriarchal life on a vast estate, say a hundred thousand acres, somewhere in the Southern States of America. I mean to be a planter, to have slaves, to make a few snug millions by selling my cattle, timber, and tobacco; I want to live an absolute monarch, and to do just as I please; to lead such a life as no one here in these squalid dens of lath and plaster ever imagines. I am a great poet; I do not write my poems, I feel them, and act them. At this moment I have fifty thousand francs, which might possibly buy forty negroes. I want two hundred thousand francs, because I want to have two hundred negroes to carry out my notions of the patriarachal life properly. Negroes, you see, are like a sort of family ready grown, and there are no inquisitive public prosecutors out there to interfere with you. That investment in ebony ought to mean three or four million francs in ten years' time. If I am successful, no one will ask me who I am. I shall be Mr. Four Millions, an American citizen. I shall be fifty years old by then, and sound and hearty still; I shall enjoy life after my own fashion. In two words, if I find you an heiress with a million, will you give me two hundred thousand francs? Twenty per cent commission, eh? Is that too much? Your little wife will be very much in love with you. Once married, you will show signs of uneasiness and remorse; for a couple of weeks you will be depressed. Then, some night after a bit of monkey business, comes the confession, between two kisses, ‘Two hundred thousand francs of debts, my darling!' This sort of farce is played every day in Paris, and by young men of the greatest distinction. When a young wife has given her heart, she will not refuse her purse. Perhaps you are thinking that you will lose the money for good? Not you. You will make two hundred thousand francs again by some stroke of business. With your capital and your brains you should be able to accumulate as large a fortune as you could wish. Ergo, in six months you will have made your own fortune, and your old friend Vautrin's, and made a charming woman very happy, to say nothing of your people at home, who must blow on their fingers to warm them, in the winter, for lack of firewood. You need not be surprised at my proposal, nor at the demand I make. Forty-seven out of every sixty great matches here in Paris are made after just such a bargain as this. The Chamber of Notaries compels my gentleman to—"

"What must I do?" said Rastignac, eagerly interrupting Vautrin's speech.

"Next to nothing," returned the other, with a slight involuntary movement, the suppressed exultation of the angler when he feels a bite at the end of his line. "Follow me carefully! The heart of a girl whose life is wretched and unhappy is a sponge that will thirstily absorb love; a dry sponge that swells at the first drop of sentiment. If you pay court to a young girl whose existence is a compound of loneliness, despair, and poverty, and who has no suspicion that she will come into a fortune, good Lord! it is to hold the game in your own hand; it is knowing the numbers of the lottery beforehand; it is speculating in the funds when you have news from a sure source; it is building up a marriage on an indestructible foundation. The girl may come in for millions, and she will fling them, as if they were so many pebbles, at your feet. 'Take it, my beloved! Take it, Alfred, Adolphe, Eugène!' or whoever it was that showed his sense by sacrificing himself for her. And as for sacrificing himself, this is how I understand it. You sell a coat that is getting shabby, so that you can take her to the Blue Dial, treat her to mushrooms on toast, and then go to the Ambigu-Comique in the evening; you pawn your watch to buy her a shawl. I need not remind you of the fiddle-faddle sentimentality that goes down so well with all women; you spill a few drops of water on your stationery, for instance; those are the tears you shed while far away from her. You look to me as if you were perfectly acquainted with the argot of the heart. Paris, you see, is like a forest in the New World, where you have to deal with a score of varieties of savages—Illinois and Hurons, who live on the proceeds of their social hunting. You are a hunter of millions; you set your snares; you use lures and nets; there are many ways of hunting. Some hunt heiresses, others a legacy; some fish for souls, yet others sell their clients, bound hand and foot. Every one who comes back from the chase with his game-bag well filled meets with a warm welcome in good society. In justice to this hospitable part of the world, it must be said that you have to do with the most easy and good-natured of great cities. If the proud aristocracies of the rest of Europe refuse admittance among their ranks to a disreputable millionaire, Paris stretches out a hand to him, goes to his banquets, eats his dinners, and drinks to his infamous health."

"But where is such a girl to be found?" asked Eugène.

"Under your eyes; she is yours already."

"Mlle. Victorine?"

"Precisely."

"And what was that you said?"

"She is in love with you already, your little Baronne de Rastignac!"

"She has not a penny," Eugène continued, much mystified.

"Ah! now we are coming to it! Just another word or two, and it will all be clear enough. Her father, Taillefer, is an old scoundrel; it is said that he murdered one of his friends at the time of the Revolution. He is one of your comedians that sets up to have opinions of his own. He is a banker—senior partner in the house of Frédéric Taillefer and Company. He has one son, and means to leave all he has to the boy, to the prejudice of Victorine. For my part, I don't like to see injustice of this sort. I am like Don Quixote, I have a fancy for defending the weak against the strong. If it should please God to take that youth away from him, Taillefer would have only his daughter left; he would want to leave his money to someone or other; an absurd notion, but it is only human nature, and he is not likely to have any more children, as I know. Victorine is gentle and amiable; she will soon twist her father round her fingers, and set his head spinning like a German top by plying him with sentiment! She will be too much touched by your devotion to forget you; you will marry her. I mean to play Providence for you, and Providence is to do my will. I have a friend whom I am devoted, a colonel in the Army of the Loire, who has just been transferred into the Royal Guard. He has taken my advice and turned ultra-royalist; he is not one of those fools who never change their opinions. Of all pieces of advice, my cherub, I would give you this—don't stick to your opinions any more than to your words. If any one asks you for them, let him have them—at a price. A man who prides himself on going in a straight line through life is an idiot who believes in infallibility. There are no such things as principles; there are only events, and there are no laws but those of expediency: a man of talent accepts events and the circumstances in which he finds himself, and turns everything to his own ends. If laws and principles were fixed and invariable, nations would not change them as readily as we change our shirts. The individual is not obliged to be more particular than the nation. A man whose services to France have been of the very slightest is a fetich looked on with superstitious awe because he has always seen everything in red; but he is good, at the most, to be put into the Museum of Arts and Crafts, among the automatic machines, and labeled La Fayette; while the prince at whom everybody flings a stone, the man who despises humanity enough to spit out as many oaths as it demands, saved France from being torn in pieces at the Congress of Vienna; and they who should have given him laurels fling mud at him. Oh! I know something of affairs, I can tell you; I have the secrets of many men! Enough. When I find three minds in agreement as to the application of a principle, I shall have a fixed and immovable opinion—I shall have to wait a long while first. In the Tribunals you will not find three judges of the same opinion on a single point of law. To return to the man I was telling you of. He would crucify Jesus Christ again, if I bade him. At a word from his old chum Vautrin he will pick a quarrel with a scamp that will not send so much as five francs to his sister, poor girl, and"—here Vautrin rose to his feet and stood like a fencing master about to lunge—"turn him off into the dark!" he added.

"How frightful!" said Eugène. "You do not really mean it? M. Vautrin, you are joking!"

"There! there! Keep cool!" said the other. "Don't behave like a baby. But if you find any amusement in it, be indignant, flare up! Say that I am a scoundrel, a rascal, a rogue, a bandit; but do not call me a cheat nor a spy! There, out with it, fire away! I forgive you; it is quite natural at your age. I was like that myself once. Only remember this, you will do worse things yourself some day. You will flirt with some pretty woman and take her money. You have thought of that, of course," said Vautrin, "for how are you to succeed unless love is laid under contribution? There are no two ways about virtue, my dear student; it either is, or it is not. Talk of doing penance for your sins! It is a nice system of business, when you pay for your crime by an act of contrition! You seduce a woman that you may set your foot on such and such a rung of the social ladder; you sow dissension among the children of a family; you descend, in short, to every base action that can be committed at home or abroad, to gain your own ends for your own pleasure or your profit; and can you imagine that these are acts of faith, hope, or charity? How is it that a dandy, who in a night has robbed a boy of half his fortune, gets only a couple of months in prison; while a poor devil who steals a banknote for a thousand francs, with aggravating circumstances, is condemned to penal servitude? Those are your laws. Not a single provision but lands you in some absurdity. That man with yellow gloves and a golden tongue commits many a murder; he sheds no blood, but he drains his victim's veins as surely; a desperado forces open a door with a crowbar, dark deeds both of them! You yourself will do every one of those things that I suggest to you today, bar the bloodshed. Do you believe that there is any absolute standard in this world? Despise mankind and find out the meshes that you can slip through in the net of the Code. The secret of a great success for which you are at a loss to account is a crime that has never been found out, because it was properly executed."

"Silence, sir! I will not hear any more; you make me doubt myself. At this moment I know nothing; I can only feel."

"Just as you please, my pretty boy; I did think you were so weak-minded," said Vautrin, "I shall say no more about it. One last word, however"—and he looked hard at the student—"you have my secret," he said.

"A young man who refuses your offer knows that he must forget it."

"Quite right, quite right; I am glad to hear you say so. Somebody else might not be so scrupulous, you see. Keep in mind what I want to do for you. I will give you a fortnight. Take it and leave it."

"What a head of iron the man has!" said Eugène to himself as he watched Vautrin walk unconcernedly away with his cane under his arm. "Yet Mme. de Beauséant said as much more gracefully; he has only stated the case in cruder language. He would tear my heart with claws of steel. What made me think of going to Mme. de Nucingen? He guessed my motives before I knew them myself. To sum it up, that outlaw has told me more about virtue than all I have learned from men and books. If virtue admits of no compromises, I have certainly robbed my sisters," he said, throwing down the bags on the table.

He sat down again and fell into deep thought, unconscious of his surroundings.

"To be faithful to an ideal of virtue! A heroic martyrdom! Pshaw! every one believes in virtue, but who is virtuous? Nations have made an idol of Liberty, but what nation on the face of the earth is free? My youth is still like a blue and cloudless sky. If I set myself to obtain wealth or power, does it not mean that I must make up my mind to lie, and fawn, and cringe, and swagger, and flatter, and dissemble? To consent to be the servant of others who have likewise fawned and lied, and flattered? Must I cringe to them before I can hope to be their accomplice? Well, then, I decline. I mean to work nobly and with a single heart. I will work day and night; I will owe my fortune to nothing but my own exertions. It may be the slowest of all roads to success, but I shall lay my head on the pillow at night untroubled by evil thoughts. Is there a greater or a better thing than this—to look back over your life and know that it is stainless as a lily? I and my life are like a young man and his betrothed. Vautrin has put before me all that comes after ten years of marriage. The devil! my head is swimming. I do not want to think at all; the heart is a sure guide."

Eugène was roused from his musings by the voice of the fat Sylvie, who announced that the tailor had come, and Eugène therefore made his appearance before the man with the two money-bags, and was not ill pleased that it should be so. When he had tried on his dress suit, he put on his new morning costume, which completely metamorphosed him.

"I look quite as well as M. de Trailles," he said to himself. "In short, I look like a gentleman."

"You asked me, sir, if I knew the houses where Mme. de Nucingen goes," Old Goriot's voice spoke from the doorway of Eugène's room.

"Yes."

"Very well then, she is going to the Maréchale Carigliano's ball on Monday. If you can manage to be there, I shall hear from you whether my two girls enjoyed themselves, and how they were dressed, and all about it in fact."

"How did you find that out, my good Goriot?" said Eugène, putting a chair by the fire for his visitor.

"Her maid told me. I hear all about their doings from Thérèse and Constance," he added gleefully.

The old man looked like a lover who is still young enough to be made happy by the discovery of some little stratagem which brings him information of his lady-love without her knowledge.

"You will see them both!" he said, giving artless expression to a pang of jealousy.

"I do not know," answered Eugène. "I will go to Mme. de Beauséant and ask her for an introduction to the Maréchale."

Eugène felt a thrill of pleasure at the thought of appearing before the Vicomtesse, dressed as henceforward he always meant to be. The "abysses of the human heart," in the moralists' phrase, are only insidious thoughts, involuntary promptings of personal interest. The instinct of enjoyment turns the scale; those rapid changes of purpose which have furnished the text for so much rhetoric are calculations prompted by the hope of pleasure. Rastignac beholding himself well dressed and impeccable as to gloves and boots, forgot his virtuous resolutions. Youth, moreover, when bent upon wrongdoing does not dare to behold itself in the mirror of consciousness; mature age has seen itself; and therein lies the whole difference between these two phases of life.

A friendship between Eugène and his neighbor, Old Goriot, had been growing up for several days past. This secret friendship and the antipathy that the student had begun to entertain for Vautrin arose from the same psychological causes. The bold philosopher who shall investigate the effects of mental action upon the physical world will doubtless find more than one proof of the material nature of our sentiments in the relations which they create between human beings and other animals. What physiognomist is as quick to discern character as a dog is to discover from a stranger's face whether this is a friend or no? Those by-words—"atoms," "affinities"—are facts surviving in modern languages for the confusion of philosophic wiseacres who amuse themselves by winnowing the chaff of language to find its grammatical roots. We feel that we are loved. Our sentiments make themselves felt in everything, even at a great distance. A letter is a living soul, and so faithful an echo of the voice that speaks in it, that finer natures look upon a letter as one of love's most precious treasures. Old Goriot's affection was of the instinctive order, a canine affection raised to a sublime pitch; he had scented compassion in the air, and the kindly respect and youthful sympathy in the student's heart. This friendship had, however, scarcely reached the stage at which confidences are made. Though Eugène had spoken of his wish to meet Mme. de Nucingen, it was not because he counted on the old man to introduce him to her house, for he hoped that his own audacity might stand him in good stead. All that Old Goriot had said as yet about his daughters had referred to the remarks that the student had made so freely in public on that day of the two visits.

"How could you think that Mme. de Restaud bore you a grudge for mentioning my name?" he had said on the day following that scene at dinner. "My daughters are very fond of me; I am a happy father; but my sons-in-law have behaved badly to me, and rather than make trouble between my darlings and their husbands, I choose to see my daughters secretly. Fathers who can see their daughters at any time have no idea of all the pleasure that all this mystery gives me; I cannot always see mine when I wish, do you understand? So when it is fine I walk in the Champs-Elysées, after finding out from their maids whether my daughters mean to go out. I wait near the entrance; my heart beats fast when the carriages begin to come; I admire them in their dresses, and as they pass they give me a little smile, and it seems as if everything was lighted up for me by a ray of bright sunlight. I wait, for they always go back the same way, and then I see them again; the fresh air has done them good and brought color into their cheeks; all about me people say, ‘What a beautiful woman that is!' and it does my heart good to hear them.

"Are they not my own flesh and blood? I love the very horses that draw them; I envy the little lapdog on their knees. Their happiness is my life. Every one loves after his own fashion, and mine does no one any harm; why should people trouble their heads about me? I am happy in my own way. Is there any law against going to see my girls in the evening when they are going out to a ball? And what a disappointment it is when I get there too late, and am told that 'Madame has gone out!' Once I waited till three o'clock in the morning for Nasie; I had not seen her for two whole days. I was so pleased, that it was almost too much for me! Please do not speak of me unless it is to say how good my daughters are to me. They are always wanting to heap presents upon me, but I will not have it. 'Just keep your money,' I tell them. 'What should I do with it? I want nothing.' And what am I, sir, after all? An old carcase, whose soul is always where my daughters are. When you have seen Mme. de Nucingen, tell me which of the two you prefer," said the poor man after a moment's pause, while Eugène was making ready for a walk in the Garden of the Tuileries until the hour when he could venture to appear in Mme. de Beauséant's drawing-room.

That walk was a turning-point in Eugène's career. Several women noticed him; he looked so handsome, so young, and so well dressed. This almost admiring attention gave a new turn to his thoughts. He forgot his sisters and the aunt who had robbed herself for him; he no longer remembered his own virtuous scruples. He had seen hovering above his head the fiend so easy to mistake for an angel, the devil with rainbow wings, who scatters rubies, and aims his golden shafts at palace fronts, who invests women with purple, and thrones with a glory that dazzles the eyes of fools till they forget the simple origins of royal dominion; he had heard the rustle of that Vanity whose tinsel seems to us to be the symbol of power. However cynical Vautrin's words had been, they had made an impression on his mind, just as there lies engraved in the memory of a maiden the sordid profile of the old hag who has told her she may have "gold and loved a-plenty."

Eugène lounged about the walks till it was nearly five o'clock, then he went to Mme. de Beauséant, and received one of the terrible blows against which young hearts are defenceless. Hitherto the Vicomtesse had received him with the kindly urbanity, the bland grace of manner that is the result of fine breeding, but is only complete when it comes from the heart.

Today Mme. de Beauséant bowed constrainedly, and spoke curtly:

"M. de Rastignac, I cannot possibly see you, at least not at this moment. I am engaged..."

An observer, and Rastignac instantly became an observer, could read the whole history, the character and customs of caste, in the phrase, in the tones of her voice, in her glance and bearing. He caught a glimpse of the iron hand beneath the velvet glove—the personality, the egoism beneath the manner, the wood beneath the varnish. In short, he heard that unmistakable I THE KING that issues from the plumed canopy of the throne, and finds its last echo under the crest of the simplest gentleman.

Eugène had trusted too implicitly to the generosity of a woman; he could not believe in her haughtiness. Like all the unfortunate, he had subscribed, in all good faith, the generous compact which should bind the benefactor to the recipient, and the first article in that bond, between two large-hearted natures, is a perfect equality. The kindness which knits two souls together is as rare, as divine, and as little understood as the passion of love, for both love and kindness are the lavish generosity of noble natures. Rastignac was set upon going to the Duchesse de Carigliano's ball, so he swallowed down this rebuff.

"Madame," he faltered out, "I would not have come to trouble you about a trifling matter; be so kind as to permit me to see you later, I can wait."

"Very well, come and dine with me," she said, a little confused by the harsh way in which she had spoken, for this lady was as genuinely kind-hearted as she was high-born.

Eugène was touched by this sudden relenting, but nonetheless he said to himself as he went away, "Crawl in the dust, put up with every kind of treatment. What must the rest of the world be like when one of the kindest of women forgets all her promises of befriending me in a moment, and tosses me aside like an old shoe? So it is every one for himself? It is true that her house is not a shop, and I have put myself in the wrong by needing her help. You should cut your way through the world like a cannon-ball, as Vautrin said."

But the student's bitter thoughts were soon dissipated by the pleasure which he promised himself in this dinner with the Vicomtesse. Fate seemed to determine that the smallest accidents in his life should combine to precipitate him into a career, which the terrible sphinx of the Vauquer household had described as a field of battle where you must either slay or be slain, and cheat to avoid being cheated. You leave your conscience and your heart at the barriers, and wear a mask on entering into this game of grim earnest, where, as in ancient Sparta, you must snatch at fortune, unperceived, in order to win the crown.

On his return he found the Vicomtesse gracious and kindly, as she had always been to him. They went together to the dining-room, where the Vicomte was waiting for his wife. In the time of the Restoration the luxury of the table was carried, as is well known, to the highest degree, and M. de Beauséant, like many jaded men of the world, had few pleasures left but those of good cheer; in this matter, in fact, he was a gourmand of the schools of Louis XVIII and of the Duc d'Escars, and luxury was supplemented by splendor. Eugène, dining for the first time in a house where the traditions of grandeur had descended through many generations, had never seen any spectacle like this that now met his eyes. In the time of the Empire, balls had always ended with a supper, because the officers who took part in them must be fortified for immediate service, and even in Paris might be called upon to leave the ballroom for the battlefield. This arrangement had gone out of fashion under the monarchy, and Eugène had so far only been asked to dances. The self-possession which pre-eminently distinguished him in later life already stood him in good stead, and he did not betray his amazement. Yet as he saw for the first time the finely wrought silver-plate, the completeness of every detail, the sumptuous dinner, noiselessly served, it was difficult for such an ardent imagination not to prefer this life of studied and refined luxury to the hardships of the life which he had chosen only that morning.

His thoughts went back for a moment to the lodging-house, and with a feeling of profound loathing, he vowed to himself that at New Year he would go; prompted at least as much by a desire to live among cleaner surroundings as by a wish to shake off Vautrin, whose huge hand he seemed to feel on his shoulder at that moment. When you consider the numberless forms, clamorous or mute, that corruption takes in Paris, common sense begins to wonder what mental aberration prompted the state to establish great colleges and schools there, and assemble young men in the capital; how it is that pretty women are respected, or that the gold coin displayed in the money-changer's wooden saucers does not take to itself wings in the twinkling of an eye; and when you come to think further, how comparatively few cases of crime there are, and to count up the misdemeanors committed by youth, is there not a certain amount of respect due to these patient Tantaluses who wrestle with themselves and nearly always come off victorious? The struggles of the poor student in Paris, if skilfully drawn, would furnish a most dramatic picture of modern civilization.

In vain Mme. de Beauséant looked at Eugène as if asking him to speak; the student was tongue-tied in the Vicomte's presence.

"Are you going to take me to the Italiens this evening?" the Vicomtesse asked her husband.

"You cannot doubt that I should obey you with pleasure," he answered, and there was a sarcastic tinge in his politeness which Eugène did not detect, "but I ought to go to meet someone at the Variétés."

"His mistress," said she to herself.

"Then, is not Ajuda coming for you this evening?" inquired the Vicomte.

"No," she answered petulantly.

"Very well, then, if you really must have an arm, take that of M. de Rastignac."

The Vicomtess turned to Eugène with a smile.

"That would be a very compromising step for you," she said.

"'A Frenchman loves danger, because in danger there is glory,' to quote M. de Chateaubriand," said Rastignac, with a bow.

A few moments later he was sitting beside Mme. de Beauséant in a brougham, that whirled them through the streets of Paris to a fashionable theatre. It seemed to him that some fairy magic had suddenly transported him into a box facing the stage. All the lorgnettes of the house were pointed at him as he entered, and at the Vicomtesse in her charming toilette. He went from enchantment to enchantment.

"You must talk to me, you know," said Mme. de Beauséant. "Ah! look! There is Mme. de Nucingen in the third box from ours. Her sister and M. de Trailles are on the other side."

The Vicomtesse glanced as she spoke at the box where Mlle. de Rochefide should have been; M. d'Ajuda was not there, and Mme. de Beauséant's face lighted up in a marvelous way.

"She is charming," said Eugène, after looking at Mme. de Nucingen.

"She has white eyelashes."

"Yes, but she has such a pretty slender figure!"

"Her hands are large."

"Such beautiful eyes!"

"Her face is long."

"Yes, but length gives distinction."

"It is lucky for her that she has some distinction in her face. Just see how she fidgets with her opera-glass! The Goriot blood shows itself in every movement," said the Vicomtesse, much to Eugène's astonishment.

Indeed, Mme. de Beauséant seemed to be engaged in making a survey of the house, and to be unconscious of Mme. Nucingen's existence; but no movement made by the latter was lost upon the Vicomtesse. The house was full of the loveliest women in Paris, so that Delphine de Nucingen was not a little flattered to receive the undivided attention of Mme. de Beauséant's young, handsome, and well-dressed cousin, who seemed to have no eyes for any one else.

"If you look at her so persistently, you will make people talk, M. de Rastignac. You will never succeed if you fling yourself at any one's head like that."

"My dear cousin," said Eugène, "you have protected me indeed so far, and now if you would complete your work, I only ask of you a favor which will cost you but little, and be of very great service to me. I have lost my heart."

"Already!"

"Yes."

"And to that woman!"

"How could I aspire to find any one else to listen to me?" he asked, with a keen glance at his cousin. "Her Grace the Duchesse de Carigliano is a friend of the Duchesse de Berry," he went on, after a pause; "you are sure to see her, will you be so kind as to present me to her, and to take me with you to her ball on Monday? I shall meet Mme. de Nucingen there, and enter upon my first skirmish."

"Willingly," she said. "If you have a liking for her already, your affairs of the heart are like to prosper. That is de Marsay over there in the Princesse Galathionne's box. Mme. de Nucingen is racked with jealousy. There is no better time for approaching a woman, especially if she happens to be a banker's wife. All those ladies of the Chausséed'Antin love revenge."

"Then, what would you do yourself in such a case?"

"I should suffer in silence."

At this point the Marquis d'Ajuda appeared in Mme. de Beauséant's box.

"I have made a muddle of my affairs to come to you," he said, "and I am telling you about it, so that it may not be a sacrifice."

Eugène saw the glow of joy on the Vicomtesse's face, and knew that this was love, and learned the difference between love and the affectations of Parisian coquetry. He admired his cousin, grew mute, and yielded his place to M. d'Ajuda with a sigh.

"How noble, how sublime a woman is when she loves like that!" he said to himself. "And he could forsake her for a doll! Oh! how could any one forsake her?"

There was a boy's passionate indignation in his heart. He could have flung himself at Mme. de Beauséant's feet; he longed for the power of the devil if he could snatch her away and hide her in his heart, as an eagle snatches up some white suckling kid from the plains and bears it to its eyrie. It was humiliating to him to think that in all this gallery of fair pictures he had not one picture of his own. "To have a mistress and an almost royal position is a sign of power," he said to himself. And he looked at Mme. de Nucingen as a man measures another who has insulted him.

The Vicomtesse turned to him, and the expression of her eyes thanked him a thousand times for his discretion. The first act came to an end just then.

"Do you know Mme. de Nucingen well enough to present M. de Rastignac to her?" she asked of the Marquis d'Ajuda.

"She will be delighted," said the Marquis. The handsome Portuguese rose as he spoke and took the student's arm, and in another moment Eugène found himself in Mme. de Nucingen's box.

"Madame," said the Marquis, "I have the honor of presenting to you the Chevalier Eugène de Rastignac; he is a cousin of Mme. de Beauséant's. You have made so deep an impression upon him, that I thought I would fill up the measure of his happiness by bringing him nearer to his divinity."

He spoke in a mocking tone that helped to cover somewhat the brutal significance of his words. But such an implication, if carefully disguised, never gives offence to a woman. Mme. de Nucingen smiled, and offered Eugène the place which her husband had just left.

"I do not venture to suggest that you should stay with me, monsieur," she said. "Those who are so fortunate as to be in Mme. de Beauséant's company do not desire to leave it."

"Madame," Eugène said, lowering his voice, "I think that to please my cousin I should remain with you. Before the Marquis came we were speaking of you and of your exceedingly distinguished appearance," he added aloud.

M. d'Ajuda turned and left them.

"Are you really going to stay with me, monsieur?" asked the Baroness. "Then we shall make each other's acquaintance. Mme. de Restaud told me about you, and has made me anxious to meet you."

"She must be very insincere, then, for she has shut her door on me."

"What?"

"Madame, I will tell you honestly the reason why; but I must crave your indulgence before confiding such a secret to you. I am your father's neighbor; I had no idea that Mme. de Restaud was his daughter. I was rash enough to mention his name; I meant no harm, but I annoyed your sister and her husband very much. You cannot think how severely the Duchesse de Langeais and my cousin were shocked by the bad taste of such filial apostasy. I told them all about it, and they both burst out laughing. Then Mme. de Beauséant made some comparison between you and your sister, speaking in high terms of you, and saying how very fond you were of my neighbor, M. Goriot. And, indeed, how could you help loving him? He adores you so passionately that I am jealous already. We talked about you this morning for two hours. So this evening I was quite full of all that your father had told me, and while I was dining with my cousin I said that you could not be as beautiful as affectionate. Mme. de Beauséant meant to gratify such warm admiration, I think, when she brought me here, telling me, in her gracious way, that I should see you."

"Then, even now, I owe you a debt of gratitude, monsieur," said the banker's wife. "We shall be quite old friends in a little while."

"Although a friendship with you could not be like an ordinary friendship," said Rastignac; "I should never wish to be your friend."

Such stereotyped phrases as these, in the mouths of beginners, possess an unfailing charm for women, and are insipid only when read coldly; for a young man's tone, glance, and attitude give a surpassing eloquence to the banal phrases. Mme. de Nucingen thought that Rastignac was adorable. Then, womanlike, being at a loss how to reply to the student's outspoken admiration, she answered a previous remark.

"Yes, it is very wrong of my sister to treat our poor father as she does," she said; "he has been a Providence to us. It was not until M. de Nucingen positively ordered me only to receive him in the mornings that I yielded the point. But I have been unhappy about it for a long while; I have shed many tears over it. This violence to my feelings, with my husband's brutal treatment, have been two causes of my unhappy married life. There is certainly no woman in Paris whose lot seems more enviable than mine, and yet, in reality, there is not one so much to be pitied. You will think I must be out of my senses to talk to you like this; but you know my father, and I cannot regard you as a stranger."

"You will find no one," said Eugène, "who longs as eagerly as I do to place himself at your disposal. What do all women seek? Happiness." (He answered his own question in low, vibrating tones.) "And if happiness for a woman means that she is to be loved and adored, to have a friend to whom she can pour out her wishes, her fancies, her sorrows and joys; to whom she can lay bare her heart and soul, and all her fair defects and her gracious virtues, without fear of a betrayal; believe me, the devotion and the warmth that never fails can only be found in the heart of a young man who has kept his illusions, who, at a bare sign from you, would go to his death, who neither knows nor cares to know anything as yet of the world, because you will be all the world to him. I myself, you see (you will laugh at my simplicity), have just come from the provinces; I am quite new to this world of Paris; I have only known true and loving hearts; and I made up my mind that here I should find no love. Then I chanced to meet my cousin, and to read the secret of her heart; I have divined the inexhaustible treasures of passion, and, like Cherubino, I am the lover of all women, until the day comes when I find the woman to whom I may devote myself. As soon as I saw you, as soon as I came into the theatre this evening, I felt myself borne towards you as if by the current of a stream. I had so often thought of you already, but I had never dreamed that you would be so beautiful! Mme. de Beauséant told me that I must not stare at you so hard. She does not know the charm of your red lips, your fair face, nor see how soft your eyes are.... I also am beginning to talk nonsense; but let me talk."

Nothing pleases woman better than to listen to such whispered words as these; the most puritanical among them listens even when she ought not to reply to them; and Rastignac, having once begun, continued to pour out his story, dropping his voice, that she might lean and listen; and Mme. de Nucingen, smiling, glanced from time to time at de Marsay, who still sat in the Princesse Galathionne's box.

Rastignac did not leave Mme. de Nucingen till her husband came to take her home.

"Madame," Eugène said, "I shall have the pleasure of calling upon you before the Duchesse de Carigliano's ball."

"If Matame infites you to come," said the Baron, a thick-set Alsatian, with indications of a sinister cunning in his full-moon countenance, "you are quide sure of being well receifed."





"My affairs seem to be in a promising way," said Eugène to himself. "‘Can you love me?' I asked her, and she did not resent it. "The bit is in the horse's mouth, and I have only to mount and ride"; and with that he went to pay his respects to Mme. de Beauséant, who was leaving the theatre on d'Ajuda's arm.

The student did not know that the Baroness' thoughts had been wandering; that she was even then expecting a letter from de Marsay, one of those letters that bring about a rupture that rends the soul; so, happy in his delusion, Eugène went with the Vicomtesse to the peristyle, where people were waiting till their carriages were announced.

"That cousin of yours is hardly recognizable for the same man," said the Portuguese laughingly to the Vicomtesse, when Eugène had taken leave of them. "He will break the bank. He is as supple as an eel; he will go a long way, of that I am sure. Who else could have picked out a woman for him, as you did, just when she needed consolation?"

"But it is not certain that she does not still love the faithless lover," said Mme. de Beauséant.

The student meanwhile walked back from the Théâtre-Italien to the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève, making the most delightful plans as he went. He had noticed how closely Mme. de Restaud had scrutinized him when he appeared in the Vicomtessés box, and again when he sat beside Mme. de Nucingen, and inferred that the Countess' doors would not be closed in the future. Four important houses were now open to him—for he meant to stand well with the Maréchale; he had four supporters in the inmost circle of society in Paris. Even now it was clear to him that, once involved in this intricate social machinery, he must attach himself to a spoke of the wheel that was to turn and raise his fortunes; he would not examine himself too curiously as to the methods, but he was certain of the end, and conscious of the power to gain and keep his hold.

"If Mme. de Nucingen takes an interest in me, I will teach her how to manage her husband. That husband of hers is very successful in business; he might put me in the way of making a fortune by a single stroke."

He did not say this bluntly in so many words; as yet, indeed, he was not sufficient of a diplomatist to sum up a situation, to see its possibilities at a glance, and calculate the chances in his favor. These were nothing but hazy ideas that floated over his mental horizon; they were less cynical than Vautrin's notions; but if they had been tried in the crucible of conscience, no very pure result would have issued from the test. It is by a succession of suchlike transactions that men sink at last to the level of the relaxed morality of this epoch, when there have never been so few of those who square their courses with their theories, so few of those noble characters who do not yield to temptation, for whom the slightest deviation from the line of rectitude is a crime. To these magnificent types of uncompromising Right we owe two masterpieces—the Alceste of Molière, and, in our own day, the characters of Jeanie Deans and her father in Sir Walter Scott's novel. Perhaps a work which should chronicle the opposite course, which should trace out all the devious courses through which a man of the world, a man of ambitions, drags his conscience, just steering clear of crime that he may gain his end and yet save appearances, such a chronicle would be no less edifying and no less dramatic.

Rastignac went home. He was fascinated by Mme. de Nucingen; he seemed to see her before him, slender and graceful as a swallow. He recalled the intoxicating sweetness of her eyes, her fair hair, the delicate silken tissue of the skin, beneath which it almost seemed to him that he could see the blood coursing; the tones of her voice still exerted a spell over him; he had forgotten nothing; his walk perhaps heated his imagination by sending a glow of warmth through his veins. He knocked unceremoniously at Goriot's door.

"I have seen Mme. Delphine, neighbor," said he.

"Where?"

"At the Italiens."

"Did she enjoy it?.... Just come inside," The old man got up in his nightshirt, unlocked the door, and promptly went back to bed.

"Tell me all about her," he begged. It was the first time that Eugène had been in Old Goriot's room, and he could not control his feeling of amazement at the contrast between the den in which the father lived and the costume of the daughter whom he had just beheld. The window was curtainless, the walls were damp, in places the varnished wall-paper had come away and gave glimpses of the grimy yellow plaster beneath. The wretched bed on which the old man lay boasted but one thin blanket and a wadded quilt made out of large pieces of Mme. Vauquer's old dresses. The floor was damp and very dusty. Opposite the window stood a chest of drawers made of rosewood, one of the old-fashioned kind with a curving front and brass handles, shaped like rings of twisted vine-stems covered with flowers and leaves. On a venerable wash stand with a wooden shelf stood a ewer and basin and shaving apparatus. A pair of shoes stood in one corner; a night-table by the bed had neither a door nor marble slab. There was not a trace of a fire in the empty grate; the square walnut table with the cross-bar against which Old Goriot had crushed and twisted his posset-dish stood near the hearth. The old man's hat was lying on a broken-down bureau. An armchair stuffed with straw and a couple of chairs completed the list of ramshackle furniture. From the tester of the bed, tied to the ceiling by a piece of rag, hung a strip of some cheap material in large red and black checks. No poor drudge in a garret could be worse lodged than Old Goriot in Mme. Vauquer's lodging-house. The mere sight of the room sent a chill through you and a sense of oppression; it was like the worst cell in a prison. Luckily Goriot could not see the effect that his surroundings produced on Eugène as the latter deposited his candle on the night-table. The old man turned round, keeping the bedclothes huddled up to his chin.

"Well," he said, "and which do you like the best: Mme. de Restaud or Mme. de Nucingen?"

"I like Mme. Delphine the best," said the law student, "because she loves you the best."

At the words so heartily spoken the old man's hand slipped out from under the bedclothes and grasped Eugène's.

"Thank you, thank you," he said, gratefully. "Then what did she say about me?"

The student repeated the Baroness' remarks with some embellishments of his own, the old man listening the while as though he heard a voice from heaven.

"Dear child!" he said. "Yes, yes, she is very fond of me. But you must not believe all that she tells you about Anastasie. The two sisters are jealous of each other, you see; another proof of their affection. Mme. de Restaud is very fond of me too. I know she is. A father sees his children as God sees all of us; he looks into the very depths of their hearts; he knows their intentions; and both of them are so loving. Oh! if I only had good sons-in-law, I should be too happy, and I dare say there is no perfect happiness here below. If I might live with them—simply hear their voices, know that they are there, see them go and come as I used to do at home when they were still with me; why, my heart bounds at the thought.... Were they nicely dressed?"

"Yes," said Eugène. "But, M. Goriot, how is it that your daughters have such fine houses, while you live in such a den as this?"

"Dear me, why should I want anything better?" he replied, with seeming carelessness. "I can't quite explain to you how it is; I am not used to stringing words together properly, but it all lies there," he said, tapping his heart. "My real life is in my two girls, you see; and so long as they are happy and smartly dressed, and have soft carpets under their feet, what does it matter what clothes I wear or where I lie down of a night? I shall never feel cold so long as they are warm; I shall never feel dull if they are laughing. I have no troubles but theirs. When you, too, are a father, and you hear your children's little voices, you will say to yourself, ‘That has all come from me.' You will feel that those little ones are akin to every drop in your veins, that they are the very flower of your life (and what else are they?); you will cleave so closely to them that you seem to feel every movement that they make. Everywhere I hear their voices sounding in my ears. If they are sad, the look in their eyes freezes my blood. Some day you will find out that there is far more happiness in another's happiness than in your own. It is something that I cannot explain, something within that sends a glow of warmth all through you. In short, I live my life three times over. Shall I tell you something funny? Well, then, since I have been a father, I have come to understand God. He is everywhere in the world, because the whole world comes from Him. And it is just the same with my children, monsieur. Only, I love my daughters better than God loves the world, for the world is not so beautiful as God Himself is, but my children are more beautiful than I am. Their lives are so bound up with mine that I felt somehow that you would see them this evening. Great Heaven! If any man would make my little Delphine as happy as a wife is when she is loved, I would black his boots and run on his errands. That miserable M. de Marsay is a cur; I know all about him from her maid. A longing to wring his neck comes over me now and then. He does not love her! does not love a pearl of a woman, with a voice like a nightingale and a figure like a model. Where can her eyes have been when she married that great lump of an Alsatian? They ought both of them to have married young men, good-looking and good-tempered—but, after all, they had their own way."

Old Goriot was sublime. Eugène had never yet seen his face light up as it did now with the passionate fervor of a father's love. It is worthy of remark that strong feeling has a very subtle and pervasive power; the roughest nature, in the endeavor to express a deep and sincere affection, communicates to others the influence that has put resonance into the voice, and eloquence into every gesture, wrought a change in the very features of the speaker; for under the inspiration of passion the stupidest human being attains to the highest eloquence of ideas, if not of language, and seems to move in some sphere of light. In the old man's tones and gesture there was something just then of the same spell that a great actor exerts over his audience. But does not the poet in us find expression in our affections?

"Well," said Eugène, "perhaps you will not be sorry to hear that she is pretty sure to break with de Marsay before long. That sprig of fashion has left her for the Princesse Galathionne. For my part, I fell in love with Mme. Delphine this evening."

"Stuff!" said Old Goriot.

"I did indeed, and she did not regard me with aversion. For a whole hour we talked of love, and I am to go to call on her on Saturday, the day after to-morrow."

"Oh! how I should love you, my dear man if she cared for you. You are kind-hearted; you would never make her miserable. If you were to forsake her, I would cut your throat at once. A woman does not love twice, you see! Good heavens! what nonsense I am talking, M. Eugène! It is cold; you ought not to stay here. My God! so you have heard her speak? What message did she give you for me?"

"None at all," said Eugène to himself; aloud he answered, "She told me to tell you that your daughter sends you an affectionate kiss."

"Good night, neighbor! Sleep well, and pleasant dreams to you! I have mine already made for me by that message from her. May God grant you all your desires! You have come in like a good angel on me to-night, and brought with you the air that my daughter breathes."

"Poor old fellow!" said Eugène as he lay down. "It is enough to melt a heart of stone. His daughter no more thought of him than of the Grand Turk."





Ever after this conference Goriot looked upon his neighbor as a friend, a confidant such as he had never hoped to find; and there was established between the two the only relationship that could attach this old man to another man. The passions never miscalculate. Old Goriot felt that this friendship brought him closer to his daughter Delphine; he thought that he should find a warmer welcome for himself if the Baroness should care for Eugène. Moreover, he had confided one of his troubles to the younger man. Mme. de Nucingen, for whose happiness he prayed a thousand times daily, had never known the joys of love. Eugène was certainly (to make use of his own expression) one of the nicest young men that he had ever seen, and some prophetic instinct seemed to tell him that Eugène was to give her the happiness which had not been hers. These were the beginnings of a friendship that grew up between the old man and his neighbor; but for this friendship the catastrophe of the drama must have remained a mystery.

The affection with which Old Goriot regarded Eugène, by whom he seated himself at breakfast, the change in Goriot's face, which, as a rule, looked as expressionless as a plaster cast, and a few words that passed between the two, surprised the other lodgers; Vautrin, who saw Eugène for the first time since their interview, seemed as if he would fain read the student's very soul. During the night Eugène had had some time in which to scan the vast field which lay before him; and now, as he remembered yesterday's proposal, the thought of Mlle. Taillefer's dowry came, of course, to his mind, and he could not help thinking of Victorine as the most exemplary youth may think of an heiress. It chanced that their eyes met. The poor girl did not fail to see that Eugène looked very handsome in his new clothes. So much was said in the glance thus exchanged, that Eugène could not doubt but that he was associated in her mind with the vague hopes that lie dormant in a girl's heart and gather round the first attractive newcomer. "Eight hundred thousand francs!" a voice cried in his ears, but suddenly he took refuge in the memories of yesterday evening, thinking that his extemporized fervor for Mme. de Nucingen would prove an antidote to the evil thoughts he had involuntarily entertained.

"They gave Rossini's Barber of Seville at the Italiens yesterday evening," he remarked. "I never heard such delicious music. Good gracious! how lucky people are to have a box at the Italiens!"

Old Goriot drank in every word that Eugène let fall, and watched him as a dog watches his master's slightest movement.

"You men are like fighting cocks," said Mme. Vauquer; "you do what you like."

"How did you come home?" inquired Vautrin.

"I walked," answered Eugène.

"For my own part," remarked the tempter, "I do not care about doing things by halves. If I want to enjoy myself that way, I should prefer to go in my carriage, sit in my own box, and come back comfortably. Everything or nothing; that is my motto."

"And a good one, too," commented Mme. Vauquer.

"Perhaps you will see Mme. de Nucingen today," said Eugène, addressing Goriot in an undertone. "She will welcome you with open arms, I am sure; she would want to ask you for all sorts of little details about me. I have found out that she will do anything in the world to be received by my cousin Mme. de Beauséant; don't forget to tell her that I love her too well not to think of trying to arrange this."

Rastignac went at once to the Law School. He had no mind to stay a moment longer than was necessary in that odious house. He wasted his time that day; he had fallen a victim to that fever of the brain that accompanies the too vivid hopes of youth. Vautrin's arguments had set him meditating on social life, and he was deep in these reflections when he happened on his friend Bianchon in the Jardin du Luxembourg.

"What makes you look so solemn?" said the medical student, putting an arm through Eugène's as they went towards the Palais.

"I am tormented by temptations."

"What kind? There is a cure for temptation."

"What?"

"Yielding to it."

"You laugh, but you don't know what it is all about. Have you read Rousseau?"

"Yes."

"Do you remember that he asks the reader somewhere what he would do if he could make a fortune by killing an old mandarin somewhere in China by mere force of wishing it, and without stirring from Paris?"

"Yes."

"Well, then?"

"Pshaw! I am at my thirty-third mandarin."

"Seriously, though. Look here, suppose you were sure that you could do it, and had only to give a nod. Would you do it?"

"Is he a very old mandarin? Pshaw! after all, young or old, paralytic, or well and sound, my word for it.... Well, then. Hang it, no!"

"You are a good fellow, Bianchon. But suppose you loved a woman well enough to lose your soul in hell for her, and that she wanted money for dresses and a carriage, and all her whims, in fact?"

"Why, here you are taking away my reason, and want me to reason!"

"Well, then, Bianchon, I am mad; bring me to my senses. I have two sisters as beautiful and innocent as angels, and I want them to be happy. How am I to find two hundred thousand francs apiece for them in the next five years? Now and then in life, you see, you must play for heavy stakes, and it is no use wasting your luck by betting pennies."

"But you are only stating the problem that lies before every one at the outset of his life, and you want to cut the Gordian knot with a sword. If that is the way of it, dear boy, you must be an Alexander, or to the galleys you go. For my own part, I am quite contented with the little lot I expect to make for myself somewhere in the country, when I step into my father's shoes and plod along. A man's affections are just as fully satisfied by the smallest circle as they can be by a vast circumference. Napoleon himself could only dine once, and he could not have more mistresses than an interne at the Capuchins venereal hospital. Happiness, old man, depends on what lies between the sole of your foot and the crown of your head; and whether it costs a million or a hundred louis, the actual amount of pleasure that you receive rests entirely with you, and is just exactly the same in any case. I am for letting that Chinaman live."

"Thank you, Bianchon; you have done me good. We will always be friends."

"I say," remarked the medical student, "as I was coming out of Cuvier's lecture at the Bontanical Gardens, I saw the Michonneau and Poiret a few minutes ago on a bench chatting with a gentleman whom I used to see in last year's troubles hanging about the Chamber of Deputies; he seems to me, in fact, to be a detective dressed up like a decent retired tradesman. Let us keep an eye on that couple; I will tell you why some time. Good-bye; it is nearly four o'clock, and I must be in to answer to my name."

When Eugène reached the lodging-house, he found Old Goriot waiting for him.

"Here," cried the old man, "here is a letter from her. Pretty handwriting, eh?"

Eugène broke the seal and read:


SIR. I have heard from my father that you are fond of Italian music. I shall be delighted if you will do me the pleasure of accepting a seat in my box. La Fodor and Pellegrini will sing on Saturday, so I am sure that you will not refuse me. M. de Nucingen and I shall be pleased if you will dine with us; we shall be quite by ourselves. If you will come and be my escort, my husband will be glad to be relieved of his duties. Do not answer, but simply come. Yours sincerely,

D. DE N.



"Let me see it," said Old Goriot, when Eugène had read the letter. "You are going, aren't you?" he added, when he had smelled the writing-paper. "How nice it smells! Her fingers have touched it, that is certain."

"A woman does not fling herself at a man's head in this way," the student was thinking. "She wants to use me to bring back de Marsay; nothing but pique makes a woman do a thing like this."

"Well," said Old Goriot, "what are you thinking about?"

Eugène did not know the fever or vanity that possessed some women in those days; how should he imagine that to open a door in the Faubourg Saint-Germain a banker's wife would go to almost any length. For the coterie of the Faubourg Saint-Germain was a charmed circle, and the women who moved in it were at that time the queens of society; and among the greatest of these Dames of the Inner Circle, as they were called, were Mme. de Beauséant and her friends the Duchesse de Langeais and the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse. Rastignac was alone in his ignorance of the frantic efforts made by women who lived in the Chausée-d'Antin to enter this seventh heaven and shine among the brightest constellations of their sex. But his cautious disposition stood him in good stead, and kept his judgment cool, and the not altogether enviable power of imposing instead of accepting conditions.

"Yes, I am going," he replied.

So it was curiosity that drew him to Mme. de Nucingen; while, if she had treated him disdainfully, passion perhaps might have brought him to her feet. Still he waited almost impatiently for to-morrow, and the hour when he could go to her. There is almost as much charm for a young man in a first flirtation as there is in first love. The certainty of success is a source of happiness to which men do not confess, and all the charm of certain women lies in this. The desire of conquest springs no less from the easiness than from the difficulty of triumph, and every passion is excited or sustained by one or other of these two motives which divide the empire of love. Perhaps this division is one result of the great question of temperaments; which, after all, dominates social life. The melancholic temperament may stand in need of the tonic of coquetry, while those of nervous or sanguine complexion withdraw if they meet with a too stubborn resistance. In other words, the lymphatic temperament is essentially despondent, and the rhapsodic is choleric.

As he dressed himself Eugène enjoyed to the full those pleasures which a young man will not mention for fear of being laughed at. He thought, as he brushed his hair, that a pretty woman's glances would wander through the dark curls. He indulged in childish folly like any young girl dressing for a dance, and gazed complacently at his graceful figure while he smoothed out the creases of his coat.

"There are worse figures, that is certain," he said to himself.

Then he went downstairs, just as the rest of the household were sitting down to dinner, and took with good humor the boisterous applause excited by his elegant appearance. The amazement with which any attention to dress is regarded in a lodging-house is a very characteristic trait. No one can put on a new coat but every one else must say his say about it.

"Clk! clk! clk!" cried Bianchon, making the sound with his tongue against the roof of his mouth, like a driver urging on a horse.

"He holds himself like a duke and a peer of France," said Mme. Vauquer.

"Are you going a-courting?" inquired Mlle. Michonneau.

"Cock-a-doodle-doo!" cried the artist.

"My compliments to your wife," from the employee at the Museum.

"Your wife; have you a wife?" asked Poiret.

"Yes, in compartments, water-tight, floats, guaranteed fast color, all prices from twenty-five to forty sous, neat check patterns in the latest fashion and best taste, will wash, half-linen, half-cotton, half-wool; a certain cure for toothache and other complaints under the patronage of the Royal College of Physicians! children like it! a remedy for headache, indigestion, and all other diseases affecting the throat, eyes, and ears!" cried Vautrin, with a comical imitation of the volubility of a quack at a fair. "And how much shall we say for this marvel, gentlemen? Twopence? No. Nothing of the sort. All that is left in stock after supplying the Great Mogul. All the crowned heads of Europe, including the Gr-r-r-rand Duke of Baden, have been anxious to get a sight of it. Walk up! walk up! gentlemen! Pay at the desk as you go in! Strike up the music there! Brooum, la, la, trinn! la, la, boum! boum! Mister Clarinette, there, you are out of tune!" he added gruffly; "I will rap your knuckles for you!"

"Goodness! what an amusing man!" said Mme. Vauquer to Mme. Couture; "I should never feel dull with him in the house."

This burlesque of Vautrin's was the signal for an outburst of merriment, and under cover of jokes and laughter Eugène caught a glance from Mlle. Taillefer; she had leaned over to say a few words in Mme. Couture's ear.

"The cab is at the door," announced Sylvie.

"But where is he going to dine?" asked Bianchon.

"With Madame la Baronne de Nucingen."

"M. Goriot's daughter," said the law student.

At this, all eyes turned to the old vermicelli-maker; he was gazing at Eugène with something like envy in his eyes.

Rastignac reached the house in the Rue Saint-Lazare, one of those many-windowed houses with a mean-looking portico and slender columns, which are considered the thing in Paris, a typical banker's house, decorated in the most ostentatious fashion; the walls lined with stucco, the landings of marble mosaic. Mme. de Nucingen was sitting in a little drawing-room; the room was painted in the Italian fashion, and decorated like a restaurant. The Baroness seemed depressed. The effort that she made to hide her feelings aroused Eugène's interest; it was plain that she was not playing a part. He had expected a little flutter of excitement at his coming, and he found her dispirited and sad. The disappointment piqued his vanity.

"My claim to your confidence is very small, madame," he said, after rallying her on her abstracted mood; "but if I am in the way, please tell me so frankly; I count on your good faith."

"No, stay with me," she said; "I shall be all alone if you go. Nucingen is dining in town, and I do not want to be alone; I want to be taken out of myself."

"But what is the matter?"

"You are the very last person whom I should tell!" she exclaimed.

"Then I am connected in some way in this secret. I wonder what it is?"

"Perhaps. Yet, no," she went on; "it is a domestic quarrel, which ought to be buried in the depths of the heart. I am very unhappy; did I not tell you so the day before yesterday? Golden chains are the heaviest of all fetters."

When a woman tells a young man that she is very unhappy, and when the young man is clever, and well dressed, and has fifteen hundred francs lying idle in his pocket, he is sure to think as Eugène said, and he becomes a coxcomb.

"What can you have left to wish for?" he answered. "You are young, beautiful, beloved, and rich."

"Do not let us talk of my affairs," she said shaking her head mournfully. "We will dine together tête-à-tête, and afterwards we will go to hear the most exquisite music. Am I to your taste?" she went on, rising and displaying her gown of white cashmere, covered with Persian embroidery in the most superb taste.

"I wish that you were altogether mine," said Eugène; "you are charming."

"You would have a forlorn piece of property," she said, smiling bitterly. "There is nothing about me that betrays my wretchedness; and yet, in spite of appearances, I am in despair. I cannot sleep; my troubles have broken my night's rest; I shall grow ugly."

"Oh! that is impossible," cried the law student; "but I am curious to know what these troubles can be that a devoted love cannot efface."

"Ah! if I were to tell you about them, you would shun me," she said. "Your love for me as yet is only the conventional gallantry that men use to masquerade in; and, if you really loved me, you would be driven to despair. I must keep silence, you see. Let us talk of something else for pity's sake," she added. "Let me show you my rooms."

"No; let us stay here," answered Eugène; he sat down on the sofa before the fire, and boldly took Mme. de Nucingen's hand in his. She surrendered it to him; he even felt the pressure of her fingers in one of the spasmodic clutches that betray terrible agitation.

"Listen," said Rastignac; "if you are in trouble, you ought to tell me about it. I want to prove to you that I love you for yourself alone. You must speak to me frankly about your troubles, so that I can put an end to them, even if I have to kill half a dozen men; or I shall go, never to return."

"Very well," she cried, putting her hand to her forehead in an agony of despair, "I will put you to the proof, and this very moment. Yes," she said to herself, "I have no other resource left."

She rang the bell.

"Is the baron's carriage ready?" she asked of the servant.

"Yes, madame."

"I shall take it myself. He can have mine and my horses. Serve dinner at seven o'clock."

"Now, come with me," she said to Eugène, who thought as he sat in the banker's carriage beside Mme. de Nucingen that he must surely be dreaming.

"To the Palais-Royal," she said to the coachman; "stop near the Théâtre-Français."

She seemed to be too troubled and excited to answer the innumerable questions that Eugène put to her. He was at a loss what to think of her mute resistance, her obstinate silence.

"Another moment and she will escape me," he said to himself.

When the carriage stopped at last, the Baroness gave the law student a glance that silenced his wild words, for he was almost beside himself.

"Is it true that you love me?" she asked.

"Yes," he answered, and in his manner and tone there was no trace of the uneasiness that he felt.

"You will not think ill of me, will you, whatever I may ask of you?"

"No."

"Are you ready to do my bidding?"

"Blindly."

"Have you ever been to a gaming-house?" she asked in a tremulous voice.

"Never."

"Ah! now I can breathe. You will have luck. Here is my purse," she said. "Take it! there are a hundred francs in it, all that such a fortunate woman as I can call her own. Go up into one of the gaming-houses—I do not know where they are, but there are some near the Palais-Royal. Try your luck with the hundred francs at a game they call roulette; lose it all, or bring me back six thousand francs. I will tell you about my troubles when you come back."

"Devil take me, I'm sure, if I have a glimmer of a notion of what I am about, but I will obey you," he added, with inward exultation, as he thought, "She has gone too far to draw back—she can refuse me nothing now!"

Eugène took the dainty little purse, inquired the way of a second-hand clothes-dealer, and hurried to number 9, which happened to be the nearest gaming-house. He mounted the staircase, surrendered his hat, and asked the way to the roulette-table, whither the attendant took him, not a little to the astonishment of the regular comers. All eyes were fixed on Eugène as he asked, without bashfulness, where he was to deposit his stakes.

"If you put a louis on one only of those thirty-six numbers, and it turns up, you will win thirty-six louis," said a respectable-looking, white-haired old man in answer to his inquiry.

Eugène staked the whole of his money on the number 21 (his own age). There was a cry of surprise; before he knew what he had done, he had won.

"Take your money off, sir," said the old gentleman; "you don't often win twice running by that system."

Eugène took the rake that the old man handed to him, and drew in his three thousand six hundred francs, and, still perfectly ignorant of what he was about, staked again on the red. The bystanders watched him enviously as they saw him continue to play. The disc turned, and again he won; the banker threw him three thousand six hundred francs once more.

"You have seven thousand two hundred francs of your own," the old gentleman said in his ear. "Take my advice and go away with your winnings; red has turned up eight times already. If you are charitable, you will show your gratitude for sound counsel by giving a trifle to an old prefect of Napoleon who is down on his luck."

Rastignac's head was swimming; he saw ten of his louis pass into the white-haired man's possession, and went downstairs with his seven thousand francs; he was still ignorant of the game, and stupefied by his luck.

"So, that is over; and now where will you take me?" he asked, as soon as the door was closed, and he showed the seven thousand francs to Mme. de Nucingen.

Delphine flung her arms about him, but there was no passion in that wild embrace.

"You have saved me!" she cried, and tears of joy flowed fast.

"I will tell you everything, my friend. For you will be my friend, will you not? I am rich, you think, very rich; I have everything I want, or I seem as if I had everything. Very well, you must know that M. de Nucingen does not allow me the control of a single penny; he pays all the bills for the house expenses; he pays for my carriages and opera box; he does not give me enough to pay for my dress, and he reduces me to secret poverty on purpose. I am too proud to beg from him. I should be the vilest of women if I could take his money at the price at which he offers it. Do you ask how I, with seven hundred thousand francs of my own, could let myself be robbed? It is because I was proud, and scorned to speak. We are so young, so artless when our married life begins! I never could bring myself to ask my husband for money; the words would have made my lips bleed, I did not dare to ask; I spent my savings first, and then the money that my poor father gave me, then I ran into debt. Marriage for me is a hideous farce; I cannot talk about it; let it suffice to say that Nucingen and I have separate rooms, and that I would fling myself out of the window sooner than consent to any other manner of life. I suffered agonies when I had to confess to my girlish extravagance, my debts for jewelry and trifles (for our poor father had never refused us anything, and spoiled us), but at last I found courage to tell him about them. After all, I had a fortune of my own. Nucingen flew into a rage; he said that I should be the ruin of him, and used frightful language! I wished myself a hundred feet down in the earth. He had my dowry, so he paid my debts, but he stipulated at the same time that my expenses in future must not exceed a certain fixed sum, and I gave way for the sake of peace. And then," she went on, "I wanted to gratify the vanity of someone whom you know. He may have deceived me, but I should do him the justice to say that there was nothing petty in his character. But, after all, he threw me over disgracefully. If, at a woman's utmost need, somebody heaps gold upon her, he ought never to forsake her; that love should last for ever! But you, at one-and-twenty, you, the soul of honor, with the unsullied conscience of youth, will ask me how a woman can bring herself to accept money in such a way? My God! is it not natural to share everything with the one to whom we owe our happiness? When all has been given, why should we pause and hesitate over a part? Money is as nothing between us until the moment when the sentiment that bound us together ceases to exist. Were we not bound to each other for life? Who foresees such an end to love when he believes himself loved? You swear to love us eternally; how, then, can our interests be separate?

"You do not know how I suffered today when Nucingen refused to give me six thousand francs; he spends as much as that every month on his mistress, an opera dancer! I wanted to kill myself. The wildest thoughts came into my head. There have been moments in my life when I have envied my servants, and would have changed places with my maid. It was madness to think of going to our father, Anastasie and I have bled him dry; our poor father would have sold himself if he could have raised six thousand francs that way. I should have driven him frantic to no purpose. You have saved me from shame and death; I was beside myself with anguish. Ah! monsieur, I owed you this explanation after my mad ravings. When you left me just now, as soon as you were out of sight, I longed to escape, to run away... where, I did not know. Half the women in Paris lead such lives as mine; they live in apparent luxury, and in their souls are tormented by anxiety. I know of poor creatures even more miserable than I; there are women who are driven to ask their tradespeople to make out false bills, women who rob their husbands. Some men believe that an Indian shawl worth a thousand louis only cost five hundred francs, others that a shawl costing five hundred francs is worth a hundred louis. There are women, too, with narrow incomes, who scrape and save and starve their children to pay for a dress. I am innocent of these base meannesses. But this is the last extremity of my torture. Some women will sell themselves to their husbands, and so obtain their way, but I, at any rate, am free. If I chose, Nucingen would cover me with gold, but I would rather weep on the breast of a man whom I can respect. Ah! tonight, M. de Marsay will no longer have a right to think of me as a woman whom he has paid." She tried to conceal her tears from him, hiding her face in her hands; Eugène drew them away and looked at her; she seemed to him sublime at that moment.

"It is hideous, is it not," she cried, "to speak in a breath of money and affection. You cannot love me after this," she added.

The incongruity between the ideas of honor which make women so great, and the errors in conduct which are forced upon them by the constitution of society, had thrown Eugène's thoughts into confusion; he uttered soothing and consoling words, and wondered at the beautiful woman before him, and at the artless imprudence of her cry of pain.

"You will not remember this against me?" she asked; "promise me that you will not."

"Ah! madame, I am incapable of doing so," he said. She took his hand and held it to her heart, a movement full of grace that expressed her deep gratitude.

"I am free and happy once more, thanks to you," she said. "Oh! I have felt lately as if I were in the grasp of an iron hand. But after this I mean to live simply and to spend nothing. You will think me just as pretty, will you not, my friend? Keep this," she went on, as she took only six of the banknotes. "In conscience I owe you a thousand crowns, for I really ought to go halves with you."

Eugène's virgin conscience resisted; but when the Baroness said, "I am bound to look on you as an accomplice or as an enemy," he took the money.

"It shall be a last stake in reserve," he said, "in case of misfortune."

"That was what I was dreading to hear," she cried, turning pale. "Oh, if you wish me to be anything to you, swear to me that you will never re-enter a gaming-house. Great Heaven! that I should corrupt you! I should die of sorrow!"

They had reached the Rue Saint-Lazare by this time. The contrast between the ostentation of wealth in the house, and the wretched condition of its mistress, dazed the student; and Vautrin's cynical words began to ring in his ears.

"Seat yourself there," said the Baroness, pointing to a low chair beside the fire. "I have a difficult letter to write," she added. "Tell me what to say."

"Say nothing," Eugène answered her. "Put the bills in an envelope, direct it, and send it by your maid."

"Why, you are perfectly delicious," she said. "Ah! see what it is to have been well brought up. That is the Beauséant through and through," she went on, smiling at him.

"She is charming," thought Eugène, more and more in love. He looked round him at the room; there was an ostentatious character about the luxury, a meretricious taste in the splendor.

"Do you like it?" she asked, as she rang for the maid.

"Thérèse, take this to M. de Marsay, and give it into his hands yourself. If he is not at home, bring the letter back to me."

Thérèse went, but not before she had given Eugène a spiteful glance.

Dinner was announced. Rastignac gave his arm to Mme. de Nucingen; she led the way into a pretty dining-room, and again he saw the luxury of the table which he had admired in his cousin's house.

"Come and dine with me on opera evenings, and we will go to the Italiens afterwards," she said.

"I should soon grow used to the pleasant life if it could last, but I am a poor student, and I have my way to make."

"Oh! you will succeed," she said laughing. "You will see. All that you wish will come to pass. I did not expect to be so happy."

It is women's nature to prove the impossible by the possible, and to annihilate facts by presentiments. When Mme. de Nucingen and Rastignac took their places in her box at the Bouffons, her face wore a look of happiness that made her so lovely that every one indulged in those small slanders against which women are defenceless; for the scandal that is uttered lightly is often seriously believed. Those who know Paris believe nothing that is said, and say nothing of what is done there.

Eugène took the Baroness' hand in his, and by some light pressure of the fingers, or a closer grasp of the hand, they found a language in which to express the sensations which the music gave them. It was an evening of intoxicating delight for both; and when it ended, and they went out together, Mme. de Nucingen insisted on taking Eugène with her as far as the Pont Neuf, he disputing with her the whole of the way for a single kiss after all those that she had showered upon him so passionately at the Palais-Royal; Eugène reproached her with inconsistency.

"That was gratitude," she said, "for devotion that I did not dare to hope for, but now it would be a promise."

"And will you give me no promise, ingrate?"

He grew vexed. Then, with one of those impatient gestures that fill a lover with ecstasy, she gave him her hand to kiss, and he took it with a discontented air that delighted her.

"I shall see you at the ball on Monday," she said.

As Eugène went home in the moonlight, he fell to serious reflections. He was satisfied, and yet dissatisfied. He was pleased with an adventure which would probably give him his desire, for in the end one of the prettiest and best-dressed women in Paris would be his; but, as a set-off, he saw his hopes of fortune brought to nothing; and as soon as he realized this fact, the vague thoughts of yesterday evening began to take a more decided shape in his mind. A check is sure to reveal to us the strength of our hopes. The more Eugène learned of the pleasures of life in Paris, the more impatient he felt of poverty and obscurity. He crumpled the banknote in his pocket, and found any quantity of plausible excuses for appropriating it.

He reached the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève at last, and from the stairhead he saw a light in Goriot's room; the old man had lighted a candle, and set the door ajar, lest the student should pass him by, and go to his room without "telling him all about his daughter," to use his own expression. Eugène, accordingly, told him everything without reserve.

"Then they think that I am ruined!" cried Old Goriot, in an agony of jealousy and desperation. "Why, I have still thirteen hundred livres a year! My God! Poor little girl! Why did she not come to me? I would have sold my stock; she should have had some of the principal, and I would have bought a life-annuity with the rest. My good neighbor, why did not you come to tell me of her difficulty? How had you the heart to go and risk her poor little hundred francs at play? This is heart-breaking work. You see what it is to have sons-in-law. Oh! if I had hold of them, I would wring their necks. Oh God! Did you say she was crying?"

"With her head on my waistcoat," said Eugène.

"Oh! give it to me," said Old Goriot. "What! my daughter's tears have fallen there—my darling Delphine, who never used to cry when she was a little girl! Oh! I will buy you another; do not wear it again; let me have it. By the terms of her marriage contract, she ought to have the use of her property. To-morrow morning I will go and see Derville; he is an attorney. I will demand that her money should be invested in her own name. I know the law. I am an old wolf; I will show my teeth."

"Here, father; this is a banknote for a thousand francs that she wanted me to keep out of our winnings. Keep them for her, in the pocket of the waistcoat."

Goriot looked hard at Eugène, reached out and took the law student's hand, and Eugène felt a tear fall on it.

"You will succeed," the old man said. "God is just, you see. I know an honest man when I see him, and I can tell you, there are not many men like you. I am to have another dear child in you, am I? There, go to sleep; you can sleep, you are not yet a father. She was crying! and I have to be told about it!—and I was quietly eating my dinner, like an idiot, all the time—I, who would sell the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost to spare either of them a single tear."





"An honest man!" said Eugène to himself as he lay down. "Upon my word, I think I will be an honest man all my life; it is so pleasant to obey the voice of conscience." Perhaps none but believers in God do good in secret; and Eugène believed in a God.

The next day Rastignac went at the appointed time to Mme. de Beauséant, who took him with her to the Duchesse de Carigliano's ball. The Maréchale received Eugène most graciously. Mme. de Nucingen was there. Delphine's dress seemed to suggest that she wished for the admiration of others, so that she might shine the more in Eugène's eyes; she was eagerly expecting a glance from him, hiding, as she thought, this eagerness from all beholders. This moment is full of charm for one who can guess all that passes in a woman's mind. Who has not refrained from giving his opinion, to prolong her suspense, concealing his pleasure from a desire to tantalize, seeking a confession of love in her uneasiness, enjoying the fears that he can dissipate by a smile? In the course of the evening the law student suddenly comprehended his position; he saw that, as the cousin of Mme. de Beauséant, he was a personage in this world. He was already credited with the conquest of Mme. de Nucingen, and for this reason was a conspicuous figure; he caught the envious glances of other young men, and experienced the first fruits of vanity. People wondered at his luck, and scraps of these conversations came to his ears as he went from room to room; all the women prophesied his success; and Delphine, in her dread of losing him, promised that this evening she would not refuse the kiss that all his entreaties could scarcely win yesterday.

Rastignac received several invitations. His cousin presented him to other women who were present; women who could claim to be of the highest fashion; whose houses were looked upon as pleasant; and this was the loftiest and most fashionable society in Paris into which he was launched. So this evening had all the charm of a brilliant début; it was an evening that he was to remember even in old age, as a woman looks back on her first ball and the memories of her girlish triumphs.

The next morning, at breakfast, he related the story of his success for the benefit of Old Goriot and the lodgers. Vautrin began to smile in a diabolical fashion.

"And do you suppose," cried that cold-blooded logician, "that a young man of fashion can live here in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève, in the Maison Vauquer—an exceedingly respectable boarding-house in every way, I grant you, but an establishment that, nonetheless, falls short of being fashionable? The house is comfortable, it is lordly in its abundance; it is proud to be the temporary abode of a Rastignac; but, after all, it is in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève, and luxury would be out of place here, where we only aim at the purely patriarchalorama. If you mean to cut a figure in Paris, my young friend," Vautrin continued, with half-paternal jocularity, "you must have three horses, a tilbury for the mornings, and a closed carriage for the evening; you should spend altogether about nine thousand francs on your stables. You would show yourself unworthy of your destiny if you spent no more than three thousand francs with your tailor, six hundred in perfumery, a hundred crowns to your shoemaker, and a hundred more to your hatter. As for your laundress, there goes another thousand francs; a young man of fashion is obliged to be extremely particular about his linen; if your linen comes up to the required standard, people often do not look any further. Love and the Church demand a fair altar-cloth. That is fourteen thousand francs. I am saying nothing of losses at play, bets, and presents; it is impossible to allow less than two thousand francs for pocket-money. I have led that sort of life, and I know all about these expenses. Add the cost of necessaries next; three hundred louis for food for the dog, a thousand francs for a kennel. Well, my boy, for all these little wants of ours we had need to have twenty-five thousand francs every year in our purse, or we shall find ourselves in the mud, and people laughing at us, and our career is cut short, good-bye to success, and good-bye to your mistress! I am forgetting your valet and your groom! Is Christophe going to carry your billets-doux for you? Do you mean to employ the stationery you use at present? Suicidal policy! Hearken to the wisdom of your elders!" he went on, his bass voice growing louder at each syllable. "Either take up your quarters in a garret, live virtuously, and wed your work, or set about the thing in a different way."

Vautrin winked and leered in the direction of Mlle. Taillefer to enforce his remarks by a look which recalled the late tempting proposals by which he had sought to corrupt the student's mind.

Several days went by, and Rastignac lived in a whirl of gaiety. He dined almost every day with Mme. de Nucingen, and went wherever she went, only returning to the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève in the small hours. He rose at midday, and dressed to go into the Bois with Delphine if the day was fine, squandering in this way time that was worth far more than he knew. He turned as eagerly to learn the lessons of luxury, and was as quick to feel its fascination, as the flowers of the date palm to receive the fertilizing pollen. He played high, lost and won large sums of money, and at last became accustomed to the extravagant life that young men lead in Paris. He had returned fifteen hundred francs out of his first winnings to his mother and sisters, sending handsome presents as well as the money. He had given out that he meant to leave the Maison Vauquer; but January came and went, and he was still there, still unprepared to go.

One rule holds good of most young men—whether rich or poor. They never have money for the necessaries of life, but they have always money to spare for their caprices—an anomaly which finds its explanation in their youth and in the almost frantic eagerness with which youth grasps at pleasure. They are reckless with anything obtained on credit, while everything for which they must pay in ready money is made to last as long as possible; if they cannot have all that they want, they make up for it, it would seem, by squandering what they have. To state the matter simply—a student is far more careful of his hat than of his coat, because the latter being a comparatively costly article of dress, it is in the nature of things that a tailor should be a creditor; but it is otherwise with the hatter; the sums of money spent with him are so modest, that he is the most independent and unmanageable of his tribe, and it is almost impossible to bring him to terms. The young man in the balcony of a theatre who displays a gorgeous waistcoat for the benefit of the fair owners of opera-glasses, has very probably no socks in his wardrobe, for the hosier is another of the genus of weevils that nibble at the purse. This was Rastignac's condition. His purse was always empty for Mme. Vauquer, always full at the demand of vanity; there was a periodical ebb and flow in his fortunes, which was seldom favorable to the payment of just debts. If he was to leave that unsavory and mean abode, where from time to time his pretensions met with humiliation, the first step was to pay his hostess for a month's board and lodging, and the second to purchase furniture worthy of the new lodgings he must take in his quality of dandy, a course that remained impossible. Rastignac, out of his winnings at cards, would pay his jeweler exorbitant prices for gold watches and chains, and then, to meet the exigencies of play, would carry them to the pawnbroker, that discreet and forbidding-looking friend of youth; but when it was a question of paying for board or lodging, or for the necessary implements of a man of fashion, his imagination and pluck alike deserted him. There was no inspiration to be found in vulgar necessity, in debts contracted for past requirements. Like most of those who trust to their luck, he put off till the last moment the payment of debts that among the bourgeoisie are regarded as sacred engagements, acting on the plan of Mirabeau, who never settled his baker's bill until it underwent a compelling transformation into a bill of exchange.

It was about this time when Rastignac was down on his luck and fell into debt, that it became clear to the law student's mind that he must have some more certain source of income if he meant to live as he had been doing. But while he groaned over the thorny problems of his precarious situation, he felt that he could not bring himself to renounce the pleasures of this extravagant life, and decided that he must continue it at all costs. His dreams of obtaining a fortune appeared more and more chimerical, and the real obstacles grew more formidable. His initiation into the secrets of the Nucingen household had revealed to him that if he were to attempt to use this love affair as a means of mending his fortunes, he must swallow down all sense of decency, and renounce all the generous ideas which absolve the faults of youth. He had chosen this life of apparent splendor, but secretly gnawed by the canker-worm of remorse, a life of fleeting pleasure dearly paid for by persistent pain; like the Absent-Minded Man of La Bruyère, he had descended so far as to make his bed in a ditch; but (also like the Absent-Minded Man) he himself was uncontaminated as yet by the mire that stained his garments.

"So we have killed our mandarin, have we?" said Bianchon one day as they left the dinner table.

"Not yet," he answered, "but he is at his last gasp."

The medical student took this for a joke, but it was not a jest. Eugène had dined in the house that night for the first time for a long while, and had looked thoughtful during the meal. He had taken his place beside Mlle. Taillefer, and stayed through the dessert, giving his neighbor an expressive glance from time to time. A few of the boarders were eating walnuts at the table, and others walked about the room, still taking part in the conversation which had begun among them. People usually went when they chose; the amount of time that they lingered being determined by the amount of interest that the conversation possessed for them, or by the difficulty of the process of digestion. In winter time the room was seldom empty before eight o'clock, when the four women had it all to themselves, and made up for the silence previously imposed upon them by the preponderating masculine element. This evening Vautrin had noticed Eugène's abstractedness, and stayed in the room, though he had seemed to be in a hurry to finish his dinner and go. All through the talk afterwards he had kept out of the sight of the law student, who quite believed that Vautrin had left the room. He now took up his position cunningly in the sitting-room instead of going when the last boarders went. He had fathomed the young man's thoughts, and felt that a crisis was at hand. Rastignac was, in fact, in a dilemma, which many another young man must have known.

Mme. de Nucingen might love him, or might merely be playing with him, but in either case Rastignac had been made to experience all the alternations of hope and despair of genuine passion, and all the diplomatic arts of a Parisienne had been employed on him. After compromising herself by continually appearing in public with Mme. de Beauséant's cousin she still hesitated, and would not give him the lover's privileges which he appeared to enjoy. For a whole month she had so inflamed his senses, that at last she had made an impression on his heart. If in the earliest days the student had fancied himself to be master, Mme. de Nucingen had since become the stronger of the two, for she had skillfully roused and played upon every instinct, good or bad, in the two or three men comprised in a young student in Paris. This was not the result of deep design on her part, nor was she playing a part, for women are in a manner true to themselves even through their grossest deceit, because their actions are prompted by a natural impulse. It may have been that Delphine, who had allowed this young man to gain such an ascendency over her, conscious that she had been too demonstrative, was obeying a sentiment of dignity, and either repented of her concessions or it pleased her to suspend them. It is so natural to a Parisienne, even when passion has almost mastered her, to hesitate and pause before taking the plunge; to probe the heart of him to whom she entrusts her future. And once already Mme. de Nucingen's hopes had been betrayed, and her loyalty to a selfish young lover had been despised. She had good reason to be suspicious. Or it may have been that something in Eugène's manner (for his rapid success was making him conceited) had warned her that the grotesque nature of their position had lowered her somewhat in his eyes. She doubtless wished to assert her dignity; he was young, and she would be great in his eyes; for the lover who had forsaken her had held her so cheap that she was determined that Eugène should not think her an easy conquest, and for this very reason—he knew that de Marsay had been his predecessor. Finally, after the degradation of submission to the pleasure of a heartless young rake, it was so sweet to her to wander in the flower-strewn paths of love, that she lingered gladly to study all its charms, to feel its thrills and the coolness of its breath. The true lover was suffering for the sins of the false. This inconsistency is unfortunately only to be expected so long as men do not know how many flowers are mown down in a young woman's soul by the first stroke of deception.

Whatever her reasons may have been, Delphine was playing with Rastignac, and took pleasure in playing with him, doubtless because she felt sure of his love, and confident that she could put an end to the torture as soon as it was her royal pleasure to do so. Eugène's vanity was engaged; he could not suffer his first passage of love to end in a defeat, and persisted in his suit, like a sportsman determined to bring down at least one partridge to celebrate his first Feast of Saint Hubert. The pressure of anxiety, his wounded self-love, his despair, real or feigned, drew him nearer and nearer to this woman. All Paris credited him with this conquest, and yet he was conscious that he had made no progress since the day when he saw Mme. de Nucingen for the first time. He did not know as yet that a woman's coquetry is sometimes more delightful than the pleasure of secure possession of her love, and was overcome with helpless rage. If, at this time, while she denied herself to love, Eugène gathered the springtide spoils of his life, the fruit, somewhat sharp and green, and dearly bought, was no less delicious to the taste. There were moments when he had not a sou in his pockets, and at such times, in spite of his conscience, his thoughts would revert to Vautrin's offer and the possibility of fortune by a marriage with Mlle. Taillefer. Poverty would clamor so loudly that more than once he was on the point of yielding to the cunning temptations of the terrible sphinx, whose glance had so often exerted a strange spell over him.

Poiret and Mlle. Michonneau went up to their rooms; and Rastignac, thinking that he was alone with the women in the dining-room, sat between Mme. Vauquer and Mme. Couture, who was nodding over the woolen cuffs that she was knitting by the stove, and looked at Mlle. Taillefer so tenderly that she lowered her eyes.

"Are you in trouble, M. Eugène?" Victorine said after a pause.

"Who has not his troubles?" answered Rastignac. "If we men were sure of being loved, sure of a devotion which would be our reward for the sacrifices which we are always ready to make, then perhaps we should have no troubles."

For answer Mlle. Taillefer only gave him a glance, but it was impossible to mistake its meaning.

"You, for instance, mademoiselle; you feel sure of your heart today, but are you sure that it will never change?"

A smile flitted over the poor girl's lips; it seemed as if a ray of light from her soul had lighted up her face. Eugène was dismayed at the sudden explosion of feeling caused by his words.

"Ah! but suppose," he said, "that you should be rich and happy to-morrow, suppose that a vast fortune dropped down from the clouds for you, would you still love the man whom you loved in your days of poverty?"

A charming movement of the head was her only answer.

"Even if he were very poor?"

Again the same mute answer.

"What nonsense are you talking, you two?" exclaimed Mme. Vauquer.

"Never mind," answered Eugène; "we understand each other."

"So there is to be an engagement of marriage between M. le Chevalier Eugène de Rastignac and Mlle. Victorine Taillefer, is there?" The words were uttered in Vautrin's deep voice, and Vautrin appeared at the door as he spoke.

"Oh! how you startled me!" Mme. Couture and Mme. Vauquer exclaimed together.

"I might make a worse choice," said Rastignac, laughing. Vautrin's voice had thrown him into the most painful agitation that he had yet known.

"No more of those poor jokes, gentlemen!" said Mme. Couture. "My dear, let us go upstairs."

Mme. Vauquer followed the two ladies, meaning to pass the evening in their room, an arrangement that economized fire and candlelight. Eugène and Vautrin were left alone.

"I felt sure you would come round to it," said the elder man with his usual imperturable coolness. "But stay a moment! I have as much delicacy as anybody else. Don't make up your mind on the spur of the moment; you are a little thrown off your balance just now. You are in debt, and I want you to come over to my way of thinking after sober reflection, and not in a fit of passion or desperation. Perhaps you want a thousand crowns. There, you can have them if you like."

The tempter took out a pocketbook, and drew thence three banknotes, which he fluttered before the student's eyes. Eugène was in a most painful dilemma. He had debts, debts of honor. He owed a hundred louis to the Marquis d'Ajuda and to the Comte de Trailles; he had not the money, and for this reason had not dared to go to Mme. de Restaud's house, where he was expected that evening. It was one of those informal gatherings where tea and little cakes are handed round, but where it is possible to lose six thousand francs at whist in the course of a night.

"You must see," said Eugène, struggling to hide a convulsive tremor, "that after what has passed between us, I cannot possibly lay myself under any obligation to you."

"Quite right; I should be sorry to hear you speak otherwise," answered the tempter. "You are a fine young fellow, honorable, brave as a lion, and as gentle as a young girl. You would be a fine haul for the devil! I like youngsters of your sort. Get rid of one or two more prejudices, and you will see the world as it is. Make a little scene now and then, and act a virtuous part in it, and a man with a head on his shoulders can do exactly as he likes amid deafening applause from the fools in the gallery. Ah! a few days yet, and you will be with us; and if you would only consent to be my pupil, I would put you in the way of achieving all your ambitions. Every wish you framed could be instantly fulfilled; you should have all your desires—honors, wealth, or women. Civilization should flow with milk and honey for you. You should be our pet and favorite, our Benjamin. We would all work ourselves to death for you with pleasure; every obstacle should be removed from your path. You have a few prejudices left; so you think that I am a scoundrel, do you? Well, M. de Turenne, quite as honorable a man as you take yourself to be, had some little private transactions with bandits, and did not feel that his honor was tarnished. You don't want to put yourself under any obligation to me, eh? You need not draw back on that account," Vautrin went on, and a smile stole over his lips. "Take these bits of paper and write across this," he added, producing a piece of stamped paper, "Accepted the sum of three thousand five hundred francs due this day twelvemonth, and fill in the date. The rate of interest is stiff enough to silence any scruples on your part; it gives you the right to call me a Jew. You can call quits with me on the score of gratitude. I am quite willing that you should despise me today, because I am sure that you will have a kindlier feeling towards me later on. You will find out fathomless depths in my nature, enormous and concentrated forces that weaklings call vices, but you will never find me base or ungrateful. In short, I am neither a pawn nor a bishop, but a castle, my boy."

"What manner of man are you?" cried Eugène. "Were you created to torment me?"

"Why no; I am a good-natured fellow, who is willing to do a dirty piece of work to put you high and dry above the mire for the rest of your days. Do you ask the reason of this devotion? All right; I will tell you that some of these days. A word or two in your ear will explain it. I have begun by shocking you, by showing you the way to ring the changes, and giving you a sight of the mechanism of the social machine; but your first fright will go off like a conscript's terror on the battlefield. You will grow used to regarding men as common soldiers who have made up their minds to lose their lives for some self-constituted king. Times have altered strangely. Once you could say to a bravo, 'Here are a hundred crowns; go and kill Monsieur So-and-so for me,' and you could sup quietly after turning someone off into the dark for the least thing in the world. But nowadays I propose to put you in the way of a handsome fortune; you have only to nod your head, it won't compromise you in any way, and you hesitate. 'Tis an effeminate age."

Eugène accepted the draft, and received the banknotes in exchange for it.

"Well, well. Come, now, let us talk sense," Vautrin continued. "I mean to leave this country in a few months' time for America, and set about planting tobacco. I will send you some cigars in token of my good will. If I make money at it, I will help you in your career. If I have no children—which will probably be the case, for I have no anxiety to raise slips of myself here—you shall inherit my fortune. That is what you may call standing by a man; but I myself have a liking for you. I have a mania, too, for devoting myself to someone else. I have done it before. You see, my boy, I live in a loftier sphere than other men do; I look on all actions as means to an end, and the end is all that I look at. What is a man's life to me? Not that," he said, and he snapped his thumb-nail against his teeth. "A man, in short, is everything to me, or just nothing at all. Less than nothing if his name happens to be Poiret; you can crush him like a bed-bug, he flattens and is foul-smelling. But a man is a god when he is like you; he is not a machine covered with a skin, but a stage on which the greatest sentiments are played—great thoughts and feelings—and for these, and these only, I live. A sentiment—what is that but the whole world in a thought? Look at Old Goriot. For him, his two girls are the whole universe; they are the clue by which he finds his way through creation. Well, for my own part, I have fathomed the depths of life, there is only one real sentiment—comradeship between man and man. Pierre and Jaffier, that is my passion. I knew Venice Preserved by heart. Have you met many men who had enough hair on their chests, when a comrade says, 'Let us bury a stiff!' to go and do it without a word or plaguing him by taking a high moral tone? I have done it myself. I should not talk like this to just everybody, but you are not like an ordinary man; one can talk to you, you can understand things. You will not dabble about much longer among the tadpoles in these swamps. Well, then, it is all settled. You will marry. Both of us carry our point. Mine is made of iron, and will never soften, ha! ha!"

Vautrin went out. He would not wait to hear the student's repudiation; he wished to put Eugène at his ease. He seemed to understand the secret springs of the faint resistance still made by the younger man; the struggles in which men seek to preserve their self-respect by justifying their blameworthy actions to themselves.

"He may do as he likes; I shall not marry Mlle. Taillefer, that is certain," said Eugène to himself.

He regarded this man with abhorrence, and yet the very cynicism of Vautrin's ideas, and the audacious way in which he used other men for his own ends, raised him in the student's eyes; but the thought of a compact threw Eugène into a fever of apprehension, and not until he had recovered somewhat did he dress, call for a cab, and go to Mme. de Restaud's.

For some days the Countess had paid more and more attention to a young man whose every step seemed a triumphal progress in the great world; it seemed to her that he might be a formidable power before long. He paid MM. de Trailles and d'Ajuda, played at whist for part of the evening, and made good his losses. Most men who have their way to make are more or less of fatalists, and Eugène was superstitious; he chose to consider that his luck was Heaven's reward for his perseverance in the right way. As soon as possible on the following morning he asked Vautrin whether the bill he had given was still in the other's possession; and on receiving a reply in the affirmative, he repaid the three thousand francs with a frank show of pleasure.

"Everything is going on well," said Vautrin.

"But I am not your accomplice," said Eugène.

"I know, I know," Vautrin broke in. "You are still acting like a child. You are making mountains out of molehills at the outset."





Two days later, Poiret and Mlle. Michonneau were sitting together on a bench in the sun. They had chosen a little-frequented alley in the Jardin des Plantes and a gentleman was chatting with them, the same person, as a matter of fact, about whom the medical student had, not without good reason, his own suspicions.

"Mademoiselle," this M. Gondureau was saying, "I do not see any cause for your scruples. His Excellency the Minister of Police—"

"Ah!" echoed Poiret, "his Excellency the Minister of Police!"

"Yes, his Excellency is taking a personal interest in the matter," said Gondureau.

Who would think it probable that Poiret, a retired clerk, doubtless possessed of some notions of civic virtue, though there might be nothing else in his head—who would think it likely that such a man would continue to lend an ear to this supposed independent gentleman of the Rue de Buffon, when the latter dropped the mask of a decent citizen by that word "police," and gave a glimpse of the features of a detective from the Rue de Jérusalem? And yet nothing was more natural. Perhaps the following remarks from the hitherto unpublished records made by certain observers will throw a light on the particular species to which Poiret belonged in the great family of fools. There is a race of quill-drivers, confined in the columns of the budget between the first degree of latitude (a kind of administrative Greenland where the salaries begin at twelve hundred francs) and the third degree, a more temperate zone, where incomes grow from three to six thousand francs, a climate where the bonus flourishes like a half-hardy annual in spite of some difficulties of culture. A characteristic trait that best reveals the feeble narrow-mindedness of these inhabitants of petty officialdom is a kind of involuntary, mechanical, and instinctive reverence for the Grand Lama of every Ministry, known to the rank and file only by his signature (an illegible scrawl) and by his title—"His Excellency the Minister," four words which produce as much effect as the il Bondo Cani of the Caliph of Bagdad, four words which in the eyes of this low order of intelligence represent a sacred power from which there is no appeal. The Minister is administratively infallible for the clerks in the employ of the government, as the Pope is infallible for good Catholics. Something of his peculiar radiance invests everything he does or says, or that is said or done in his name; the robe of office covers everything and legalizes everything done by his orders; does not his very title—his Excellency—vouch for the purity of his intentions and the righteousness of his will, and serve as a sort of passport and introduction to ideas that otherwise would not be entertained for a moment? Pronounce the words "His Excellency," and these poor folk will forthwith proceed to do what they would not do for their own interests. Passive obedience is as well known in a government department as in the army itself; and the administrative system silences consciences, annihilates the individual, and ends (give it time enough) by fashioning a man into a vise or a thumbscrew, and he becomes part of the machinery of government. Wherefore M. Gondureau, who seemed to know something of human nature, recognized Poiret at once as one of those dupes of officialdom, and brought out for his benefit, at the proper moment, the deus ex machina, the magical words "his Excellency," so as to dazzle Poiret just as he himself unmasked his batteries, for he took Poiret and the Michonneau for the male and female of the same species.

"If his Excellency himself, his Excellency the Minister... Ah! that is quite another thing," said Poiret.

"You seem to be guided by this gentleman's opinion, and you hear what he says," said the man of independent means, addressing Mlle. Michonneau. "Very well, his Excellency is at this moment absolutely certain that the so-called Vautrin, who lodges at the Maison Vauquer, is a convict who escaped from penal servitude at Toulon, where he is known by the nickname Trompe-la-Mort."

"Trompe-la-Mort?" said Pioret. "Dear me, he is very lucky if he deserves that nickname."

"Well, yes," said the detective. "They call him so because he has been so lucky as not to lose his life in the very risky enterprises that he has carried through. He is a dangerous man, you see! He has qualities that are out of the common; the thing he is wanted for, in fact, was a matter which gained him no end of credit with his own set—"

"Then is he a man of honor?" asked Poiret.

"Yes, according to his notions. He agreed to take another man's crime upon himself—a forgery committed by a very handsome young fellow that he had taken a great fancy to, a young Italian, a bit of a gambler, who has since gone into the army, where his conduct has been irreproachable."

"But if his Excellency the Minister of Police is certain that M. Vautrin is this Trompe-la-Mort, why should he want me?" asked Mlle. Michonneau.

"Oh yes," said Poiret, "if the Minister, as you have been so obliging as to tell us, really knows for a certainty—"

"Certainty is not the word; he only suspects. You will soon understand how things are. Jacques Collin, nicknamed Trompe-la-Mort, is in the confidence of every convict in the three prisons; he is their man of business and their banker. He makes a very good thing out of managing their affairs, which want a man of mark to see about them."

"Ha! ha! do you see the pun, mademoiselle?" asked Poiret. "This gentleman calls himself a man of mark because he is a marked man— branded, you know."

"This so-called Vautrin," said the detective, "receives the money belonging to the convicts, invests it for them, and holds it at the disposal of those who escape, or hands it over to their families if they leave a will, or to their mistresses when they draw upon him for their benefit."

"Their mistresses! You mean their wives," remarked Poiret.

"No, sir. A convict's wife is usually an illegitimate connection. We call them concubines."

"Then they all live in a state of concubinage?"

"Naturally."

"Why, these are abominations that his Excellency ought not to allow. Since you have the honor of seeing his Excellency, you, who seem to have philanthropic ideas, ought really to enlighten him as to their immoral conduct—they are setting a shocking example to the rest of society."

"But the government does not hold them up as models of all the virtues, my dear sir."

"Of course not, sir; but still—"

"Just let the gentleman say what he has to say, dearie," said Mlle. Michonneau.

"You see how it is, mademoiselle," Gondureau continued. "The government may have the strongest reasons for getting this illicit hoard into its hands; it mounts up to something considerable, by all that we can make out. Trompe-la-Mort not only holds large sums for his friends the convicts, but he has other amounts which are paid over to him by the Society of the Ten Thousand—"

"Ten Thousand Thieves!" cried Pioret in alarm.

"No. The Society of the Ten Thousand is not an association of petty offenders, but of people who set about their work on a large scale—they won't touch a matter unless there are ten thousand francs in it. It is composed of the most distinguished of the men who are sent straight to the Assize Court when they come up for trial. They know the Code too well to risk their necks when they are nabbed. Collin is their confidential agent and legal adviser. By means of the large sums of money at his disposal he has established a sort of detective system of his own; it is widespread and mysterious in its workings. We have had spies all about him for a year, and yet we could not manage to fathom his game. His capital and his cleverness are at the service of vice and crime; this money furnishes the necessary funds for a regular army of blackguards in his pay who wage incessant war against society. If we can catch Trompe-la-Mort, and take possession of his funds, we should strike at the root of this evil. So this job is a kind of government affair—a state secret—and likely to redound to the honor of those who bring the thing to a successful conclusion. You, sir, for instance, might very well be taken into a government department again; they might make you secretary to a Commissary of Police; you could accept that post without prejudice to your retiring pension."

Mlle. Michonneau interposed at this point with, "What is there to hinder Trompe-la-Mort from making off with the money?"

"Oh!" said the detective, "a man is told off to follow him everywhere he goes, with orders to kill him if he were to rob the convicts. Then it is not quite as easy to make off with a lot of money as it is to run away with a young lady of family. Besides, Collin is not the sort of fellow to play such a trick; he would be disgraced, according to his notions."

"You are quite right, sir," said Poiret, "utterly disgraced he would be."

"But none of all this explains why you do not come and take him without more ado," remarked Mlle. Michonneau.

"Very well, mademoiselle, I will explain—but," he added in her ear, "keep your companion quiet, or I shall never have done. The old boy ought to pay people handsomely for listening to him. Trompe-la-Mort, when he came back here," he went on aloud, "slipped into the skin of an honest man; he turned up disguised as a decent Parisian citizen, and took up his quarters in an unpretentious lodging-house. He is cunning, that he is! You don't catch him napping. Then M. Vautrin is a man of consequence, who transacts a good deal of business."

"Naturally," said Poiret to himself.

"And suppose that the Minister were to make a mistake and get hold of the real Vautrin, he would put every one's back up among the business men in Paris, and public opinion would be against him. The Prefect of Police is on slippery ground; he has enemies. They would take advantage of any mistake. There would be a fine outcry and fuss made by the Opposition, and he would be sent packing. We must set about this just as we did about the Cogniard affair, the sham Comte de Sainte-Hélène; if he had been the real Comte de Sainte-Hélène, we should have been in the wrong box. We want to be quite sure what we are about."

"Yes, but what you want is a pretty woman," said Mlle. Michonneau briskly.

"Trompe-la-Mort would not let a woman come near him," said the detective. "I will tell you a secret—he does not like women."

"Still, I do not see what I can do, supposing that I did agree to identify him for two thousand francs."

"Nothing simpler," said the stranger. "I will send you a little bottle containing a dose that will send a rush of blood to the head; it will do him no harm whatever, but he will fall down as if he were in a fit. The drug can be put into wine or coffee; either will do equally well. You carry your man to bed at once, and undress him to see that he is not dying. As soon as you are alone, you give him a slap on the shoulder, and, presto! the letters will appear."

"Why, that is just nothing at all," said Poiret.

"Well, do you agree?" said Gondureau, addressing the old maid.

"But, my dear sir, suppose there are no letters at all," said Mlle. Michonneau; "am I to have the two thousand francs all the same?"

"No."

"What will you give me, then?"

"Five hundred francs."

"It is such a thing to do for so little! It lies on your conscience just the same, and I must quiet my conscience, sir."

"I assure you," said Poiret, "that Mademoiselle has a great deal of conscience, and not only so, she is a very amiable person, and very intelligent."

"Well, now," Mlle. Michonneau went on, "make it three thousand francs if he is Trompe-la-Mort, and nothing at all if he is an ordinary man."

"Done!" said Gondureau, "but on the condition that the thing is settled to-morrow."

"Not quite so soon, my dear sir; I must consult my confessor first."

"You are a sly one," said the detective as he rose to his feet. "Good-bye till to-morrow, then. And if you should want to see me in a hurry, go to the Petite Rue Saint-Anne at the end of the Court of the Sainte Chapelle. There is only one door under the archway. Ask there for M. Gondureau."

Bianchon, on his way back from Cuvier's lecture, overheard the sufficiently striking nickname of Trompe-la-Mort, and caught the celebrated chief detective's "Done!"

"Why didn't you close with him? It would be three hundred francs a year," said Poiret to Mlle. Michonneau.

"Why didn't I?" she asked. "Why, it wants thinking over. Suppose that M. Vautrin is this Trompe-la-Mort, perhaps we might do better for ourselves with him. Still, on the other hand, if you ask him for money, it would put him on his guard, and he is just the man to clear out without paying, and that would be an abominable sell."

"And suppose you did warn him," Poiret went on, "didn't that gentleman say that he was closely watched? You would spoil everything."

"Anyhow," thought Mlle. Michonneau, "I can't abide him. He says nothing but disagreeable things to me."

"But you can do better than that," Poiret resumed. "As that gentleman said (and he seemed to me to be a very good sort of man, besides being very well got up), it is an act of obedience to the laws to rid society of a criminal, however virtuous he may be. Once a thief, always a thief. Suppose he were to take it into his head to murder us all? The deuce! We should be guilty of manslaughter, and be the first to fall victims into the bargain!"

Mlle. Michonneau's musings did not permit her to listen very closely to the remarks that fell one by one from Poiret's lips like water dripping from a leaky tap. When once this elderly babbler began to talk, he would go on like clockwork unless Mlle. Michonneau stopped him. He started on some subject or other, and wandered on through parenthesis after parenthesis, till he came to regions as remote as possible from his premises without coming to any conclusions by the way.

By the time they reached the Maison Vauquer he had tacked together a whole string of examples and quotations more or less irrelevant to the subject in hand, which led him to give a full account of his own deposition in the case of the Sieur Ragoulleau versus Dame Morin, when he had been summoned as a witness for the defence.

As they entered the dining-room, Eugène de Rastignac was talking apart with Mlle. Taillefer; the conversation appeared to be of such thrilling interest that the pair never noticed the two older lodgers as they passed through the room. None of this was lost to Mlle. Michonneau.

"I knew how it would end," remarked that lady, addressing Poiret. "They have been making eyes at each other in a heart-rending way for a week past."

"Yes," he answered. "So she was found guilty."

"Who?"

"Mme. Morin."

"I am talking about Mlle. Victorine," said Mlle. Michonneau, as she entered Poiret's room with an absent air, "and you answer, ‘Mme. Morin.' Who may Mme. Morin be?"

"What can Mlle. Victorine be guilty of?" demanded Poiret.

"Guilty of falling in love with M. Eugène de Rastignac, and going further and further without knowing exactly where she is going, poor innocent!"





That morning Mme. de Nucingen had driven Eugène to despair. In his own mind he had completely surrendered himself to Vautrin, and deliberately shut his eyes to the motive for the friendship which that extraordinary man professed for him, nor would he look to the consequences of such an alliance. Nothing short of a miracle could extricate him now out of the gulf into which he had walked an hour ago, when he exchanged vows in the softest whispers with Mlle. Taillefer. To Victorine it seemed as if she heard an angel's voice, that heaven was opening above her; the Vauquer lodging-house took strange and wonderful hues, like a stage fairy-palace. She loved and she was beloved; at any rate, she believed that she was loved; and what woman would not likewise have believed after seeing Rastignac's face and listening to the tones of his voice during that hour snatched under the Argus eyes of the house? He had trampled on his conscience; he knew that he was doing wrong, and did it deliberately; he had said to himself that a woman's happiness should atone for this venial sin. The energy of desperation had lent new beauty to his face; the lurid fire that burned in his heart shone from his eyes. Luckily for him, the miracle took place. Vautrin entered in in high spirits, and at once read the hearts of these two young creatures whom he had brought together by the combinations of his infernal genius, but his deep voice broke in upon their bliss.


"A charming girl is my Fanchette

　 In her simplicity,"



he sang mockingly.

Victorine fled. Her heart was more full than it had ever been, but it was full of joy, and not of sorrow. Poor child! A pressure of the hand, the light touch of Rastignac's hair against her cheek, a word whispered in her ear so closely that she felt the student's warm breath on her, the pressure of a trembling arm about her waist, a kiss upon her throat—such had been her betrothal. The proximity of the stout Sylvie, who might invade that glorified room at any moment, only made these first tokens of love more ardent, more eloquent, more entrancing than the noblest deeds done for love's sake in the most famous romances. This plainsong of love, to use the pretty expression of our forefathers, seemed almost criminal to the devout young girl who went to confession every fortnight. In that one hour she had poured out more of the treasures of her soul than she could give in later days of wealth and happiness, when her whole self followed the gift.

"The thing is arranged," Vautrin said to Eugène, who remained. "Our two dandies have fallen out. Everything was done in proper form. It is a matter of opinion. Our pigeon has insulted my hawk. They will meet to-morrow in the redoubt at Clignancourt. By half-past eight in the morning Mlle. Taillefer, calmly dipping her bread and butter in her coffee cup, will be sole heiress of her father's fortune and affections. A funny way of putting it, isn't it? Taillefer's youngster is an expert swordsman, and quite cocksure about it, but he will be bled; I have just invented a thrust for his benefit, a way of raising your sword point and driving it at the forehead. I must show you that thrust; it is an uncommonly handy thing to know."

Rastignac heard him in dazed bewilderment; he could not find a word in reply. Just then Goriot came in, and Bianchon and a few of the boarders likewise appeared.

"That is just as I intended." Vautrin said. "You know quite well what you are about. Good, my little eaglet! You are born to command, you are strong, you stand firm on your feet, you have hair on your chest! I respect you."

He made as though he would take Eugène's hand, but Rastignac hastily withdrew it, sank into a chair, and turned ghastly pale; it seemed to him that there was a sea of blood before his eyes.

"Oh! so baby's little pants are still spatted with virtue!" murmured Vautrin. "But Papa Doliban has three millions; I know the amount of his fortune. Once have her dowry in your hands, and your character will be as white as the bride's white dress, even in your own eyes."

Rastignac hesitated no longer. He made up his mind that he would go that evening to warn the Taillefers, father and son. But just as Vautrin left him, Old Goriot came up and said in his ear, "You look melancholy, my boy; I will cheer you up. Come with me."

The old vermicelli dealer lighted his dip at one of the lamps as he spoke. Eugène went with him, his curiosity had been aroused.

"Let us go up to your room," the worthy soul remarked, when he had asked Sylvie for the law student's key. "This morning," he resumed, "you thought that she did not care about you, did you not? Eh? She would have nothing to say to you, and you went away out of humor and despairing. Foolish boy! She wanted you to go because she was expecting me! Now do you understand? We were to complete the arrangements for taking an apartment for you, a charming place, you are to move into it in three days' time. Don't let her know I told you. She wants it to be a surprise; but I couldn't bear to keep the secret from you. You will be in the Rue d'Artois, only a step or two from the Rue Saint-Lazare, and you are to be housed like a prince! Any one might have thought we were furnishing the house for a bride. Oh! we have done a lot of things in the last month, and you knew nothing about it. My attorney has appeared on the scene, and my daughter is to have thirty-six thousand francs a year, the interest on her money, and I shall insist on having her eight hundred thousand francs invested in sound securities, landed property that won't run away."

Eugène was dumb. He folded his arms and paced up and down in his cheerless, untidy room. Old Goriot waited till the student's back was turned, and seized the opportunity to go to the chimney-piece and set upon it a little red morocco case with Rastignac's arms stamped in gold on the leather.

"My dear boy," said the kind soul, "I have been up to the eyes in this business. You see, there was plenty of selfishness on my part; I have an interested motive in helping you to change lodgings. You will not refuse me if I ask you something; will you, eh?"

"What is it?"

"There is a room on the fifth floor, up above your rooms, that is to let along with them; that is where I am going to live, isn't that so? I am getting old; I am too far from my girls. I shall not be in the way, but I shall be there, that is all. You will come and talk to me about her every evening. It will not put you about, will it? I shall have gone to bed before you come in, but I shall hear you come up, and I shall say to myself, ‘He has just seen my little Delphine. He has been to a dance with her, and she is happy, thanks to him.' If I were ill, it would do my heart good to hear you moving about below, to know when you leave the house and when you come in. It will be almost like having my daughter there! It is only a step to the Champs-Elysées, where they go every day, so I shall be sure of seeing them, whereas now I am sometimes too late. And then—perhaps she may come to see you! I shall hear her, I shall see her in her soft quilted morning coat tripping about as daintily as a kitten. In this one month she has become my little girl again, so light-hearted and gay. Her soul is recovering, and her happiness is owing to you! Oh! I would do anything in the world for you. Only just now she said to me, 'I am very happy, papa!' When they say ‘father' stiffly, it sends a chill through me; but when they call me ‘papa,' it as if they were little girls again, and it brings all the old memories back. I feel most their father then; I even believe that they belong to me, and to no one else."

The poor man wiped his eyes, he was crying.

"It is a long while since I have heard them talk like that, a long, long time since she took my arm as she did today. Yes, indeed, it must be quite ten years since I walked side by side with one of my girls. How pleasant it was to keep step with her, to feel the touch of her gown, the warmth of her arm! Well, I took Delphine everywhere this morning; I went shopping with her, and I brought her home again. Oh! you must let me live near you. You may want someone to do you a service some of these days, and I shall be on the spot to do it. Oh! if only that great dolt of an Alsatian would die, if his gout would have the sense to attack his stomach, how happy my poor child would be! You would be my son-in-law; you would be her husband in the eyes of the world. Bah! she has known no happiness, that excuses everything. Our Father in heaven is surely on the side of fathers on earth who love their children. How fond of you she is!" he said, raising his head after a pause. "All the time we were going about together she chatted away about you. 'He is nice-looking, papa; isn't he? He is kind-hearted! Does he talk to you about me?' Pshaw! she said enough about you to fill whole volumes; between the Rue d'Artois and the Passage des Panoramas she poured her heart out into mine. I did not feel old once during that delightful morning; I felt as light as a feather. I told her how you had given that banknote to me; it moved my darling to tears. But what can this be on your chimney-piece?" said Old Goriot at last. Rastignac had showed no sign, and he was dying of impatience.

Eugène stared at his neighbor in dumb and dazed bewilderment. He thought of Vautrin, of that duel to be fought to-morrow morning, and of this realization of his dearest hopes, and the violent contrast between the two sets of ideas gave him all the sensations of nightmare. He went to the chimney-piece, saw the little square case, opened it, and found a watch of Bréguet's make wrapped in paper, on which these words were written:


I want you to think of me every hour,because…

DELPHINE.



That last word doubtless contained an allusion to some scene that had taken place between them. Eugène felt touched. Inside the gold watch-case his arms had been wrought in enamel. The chain, the key, the workmanship, and design of the trinket all fulfilled his desires, for he had long coveted such a possession. Old Goriot was radiant. Of course he had promised to tell his daughter every little detail of the scene and of the effect produced upon Eugène by her present; he shared in the pleasure and excitement of the young people, and seemed to be not the least happy of the three. He loved Rastignac already for his own as well as for his daughter's sake.

"You must go and see her; she is expecting you this evening. That great lout of an Alsatian is going to have supper with his opera dancer. Aha! he looked very foolish when my attorney let him know where he was. He says he idolizes my daughter, does he? He had better let her alone, or I will kill him. To think that my Delphine is his"—he heaved a sigh—"it is enough to make me murder him, but it would not be manslaughter to kill that animal; he is a pig with a calf's brains. You will take me with you, will you not?"

"Yes, dear Old Goriot; you know very well how fond I am of you—"

"Yes, I do know very well. You are not ashamed of me, are you? Not you! Let me embrace you," and he flung his arms around the student's neck.

"You will make her very happy; promise me that you will! You will go to her this evening, will you not?"

"Oh! yes. I must go out; I have some urgent business on hand."

"Can I be of any use?"

"My word, yes! Will you go to old Taillefer's while I go to Mme. de Nucingen? Ask him to make an appointment with me some time this evening; it is a matter of life and death."

"Really, young man!" cried Old Goriot, with a change of countenance; "are you really paying court to his daughter, as those simpletons were saying down below?... Great heavens! you have no notion how Goriot can hit, and if you are playing a double game, I shall put a stop to it by one blow of the fist... Oh! the thing is impossible!"

"I swear to you that I love but one woman in the world," said the student. "I only knew it a moment ago."

"Oh! what happiness!" cried Goriot.

"But young Taillefer has been called out; the duel comes off to-morrow morning, and I have heard it said that he may lose his life in it."

"But what business is it of yours?" said Goriot.

"Why, I ought to tell him so, that he may prevent his son from putting in an appearance—"

Just at that moment Vautrin's voice broke in upon them; he was standing at the threshold of his door and singing:


　 "Oh! Richard, oh my king!

All the world abandons thee!

　 Broum! broum! broum! broum! broum!





"The same old story everywhere,

A roving heart and a... tra la la."



"Gentlemen!" shouted Christophe, "the soup is ready, and every one is waiting for you."

"Here," Vautrin called down to him, "come and take a bottle of my Bordeaux."

"Do you think your watch is pretty?" asked Goriot. "She has good taste, hasn't she? Eh?"

Vautrin, Old Goriot, and Rastignac came downstairs in company, and, all three of them being late, were obliged to sit together.

Eugène was as distant as possible in his manner to Vautrin during dinner; but the latter, so charming in Mme. Vauquer's opinion, had never been so witty. His lively sallies and sparkling talk put the whole table in good humor. His assurance and coolness filled Eugène with consternation.

"Why, what has come to you today?" inquired Mme. Vauquer. "You are as gay as a skylark."

"I am always in spirits after I have made a good bargain."

"Bargain?" said Eugène.

"Well, yes, bargain. I have just delivered a lot of goods, and I shall be paid a handsome commission on them—Mlle. Michonneau," he went on, seeing that the elderly spinster was scrutinizing him intently, "have you any objection to some feature in my face, that you are looking at me so sharply? Just let me know, and I will have it changed to oblige you... We shall not fall out about it, Poiret, I dare say?" he added, winking at the superannuated clerk.

"Bless my soul, you ought to pose as a Hercules jokester," said the young painter.

"I will, upon my word! if Mlle. Michonneau will consent to sit as the graveyard Venus," replied Vautrin.

"There's Poiret," suggested Bianchon.

"Oh! Poiret shall pose as Poiret. He can be a garden god!" cried Vautrin; "his name means a pear—"

"An overripe pear!" Bianchon put in. "You will come in between the pear and the cheese."

"What stuff are you all talking!" said Mme. Vauquer; "you would do better to treat us to your Bordeaux; I see the neck of a bottle there. It would keep us all in a good humor, and it is good for the stomach besides."

"Gentlemen," said Vautrin, "the Lady President calls us to order. Mme. Couture and Mlle. Victorine will take your jokes in good part, but respect the innocence of Papa Goriot. I propose a bottleorama of Bordeaus, rendered twice illustrious by the name of Laffitte, no political allusions intended. Come, you Chink!" he added, looking at Christophe, who did not offer to stir. "Christophe! Here! What, you don't answer to your own name? Bring us some liquor, Chink!"

"Here it is, sir," said Christophe, holding out the bottle.

Vautrin filled Eugène's glass and Goriot's likewise, then he deliberately poured out a few drops into his own glass, and tasted it while his two neighbors drank their wine. All at once he made a grimace.

"It tastes of the cork!" he cried. "The devil! You can drink the rest of this, Christophe, and go and find another bottle; you know where it is, don't you?—on the right. There are sixteen of us; bring us eight bottles."

"If you are going to stand treat," said the painter, "I will pay for a hundred chestnuts."

"Oh! oh!"

"Booououh!"

"Prrr!"

These exclamations came from all parts of the table like squibs from a set firework.

"Come now, Mama Vauquer, a couple of bottles of champagne," called Vautrin.

"Is that all? Just like you! Why not ask for the whole house at once? A couple of bottles of champagne; that means twelve francs! I shall never see the money back again, I know! But if M. Eugène has a mind to pay for it, I have some currant cordial."

"That currant cordial of hers is as bad as a black draught," muttered the medical student.

"Shut up, Bianchon," exclaimed Rastignac; "the very mention of black draught makes me want to know— Yes, champagne, by all means; I will pay for it," he added.

"Sylvie," called Mme. Vauquer, "bring in some biscuits, and the little cakes."

"Those little cakes are big boys, they've grown a beard," said Vautrin. "But trot out the biscuits."

The Bordeaux wine circulated; the dinner table became a livelier scene than ever, and the fun grew fast and furious. Imitations of the cries of various animals mingled with the loud laughter; the Museum official having taken it into his head to mimic a catcall rather like the caterwauling of the animal in question, eight voices simultaneously struck up with the following variations:

"Knives to grind!"

"Chick-weeds for singing bir-ds!"

"Get your pastry cones, ladies!"

"China to mend!"

"Oysters! Oysters!"

"Beaters for your wife, for your clothes!"

"Old clothes, old lace, old hats!"

"Cherries, ripe!"

But the palm was awarded to Bianchon for the nasal accent with which he rendered the cry of "Umbrellas!"

A few seconds later, and there was a head-splitting racket in the room, a storm of tomfoolery, a sort of opera, with Vautrin as conductor of the orchestra, the latter keeping an eye the while on Eugène and Old Goriot. The wine seemed to have gone to their heads already. They leaned back in their chairs, looking at the general confusion with an air of gravity, and drank but little; both of them were absorbed in the thought of what lay before them to do that evening, and yet neither of them felt able to rise and go. Vautrin gave a side glance at them from time to time, and watched the change that came over their faces, choosing the moment when their eyes drooped and seemed about to close, to bend over Rastignac and to say in his ear:

"My lad, you are not quite shrewd enough to outwit Papa Vautrin yet, and he is too fond of you to let you make a mess of your affairs. When I have made up my mind to do a thing, no one short of Providence can put me off. Aha! we were for going round to warn old Taillefer, telling tales out of school! The oven is hot, the dough is kneaded, the bread is ready for the oven; to-morrow we will eat it up and whisk away the crumbs; and we are not going to spoil the baking? ... No, no, it is all as good as done! We may suffer from a few conscientious scruples, but they will be digested along with the bread. While we are having our forty winks, Colonel Count Franchessini will clear the way to Michel Taillefer's inheritance with the point of his sword. Victorine will come in for her brother's money, a snug fifteen thousand francs a year. I have made inquiries already, and I know that her late mother's property amounts to more than three hundred thousand—"

Eugène heard all this, and could not answer a word; his tongue seemed to be glued to the roof of his mouth, an irresistible drowsiness was creeping over him. He still saw the table and the faces round it, but it was through a luminous mist. Soon the noise began to subside; one by one the boarders went. At last, when their numbers had so dwindled that the party consisted of Mme. Vauquer, Mme. Couture, Mlle. Victorine, Vautrin, and Old Goriot, Rastignac watched as though in a dream how Mme. Vauquer busied herself by collecting the bottles, and drained the remainder of the wine out of each to fill others.

"Oh! how uproarious they are! what a thing it is to be young!" said the widow.

These were the last words that Eugène heard and understood.

"There is no one like M. Vautrin for a bit of fun like this," said Sylvie. "There, just look at Christophe, snoring like a top."

"Good-bye, mamma," said Vautrin; "I am going to a theatre on the boulevard to see M. Marty in Le Mont Sauvage, a fine play taken from Le Solitaire.... If you like, I will take you and these two ladies—"

"No, thank you," said Mme. Couture.

"What! my good lady!" cried Mme. Vauquer, "decline to see a play founded on the Le Solitaire, a work by Atala de Chateaubriand? We were so fond of that book that we cried over it like Magdalens of Elodie under the line-trees last summer, and then it is an improving work that might edify your young lady."

"We are forbidden to go to the play," answered Victorine.

"Just look, those two yonder have dropped off where they sit," said Vautrin, shaking the heads of the two sleepers in a comical way.

He altered the sleeping student's position, settled his head more comfortably on the back of his chair, kissed him warmly on the forehead, and began to sing:


"Sleep, my loves, for ever sleep

While for you my watch I keep."



"I am afraid he may be ill," said Victorine.

"Then stay and take care of him," returned Vautrin. "'Tis your duty as a meek and obedient wife," he whispered in her ear. "The young fellow worships you, and you will be his little wife—there's your fortune for you. In short," he added aloud, "they lived happily ever afterwards, were much looked up to in all the countryside, and had a numerous family.' That is how all the romances end. Now, mamma," he went on, as he turned to Mme. Vauquer and put his arm round her waist, "put on your bonnet, your best flowered silk, and the countess' scarf, while I go out and call a cab—all my own self."

And he started out, singing as he went:


"Oh! sun! divine sun!

Ripening the pumpkins every one."



"My goodness! Well, I'm sure! Mme. Couture, I could live happily in a garret with a man like that. There, now!" she added, looking round for the old vermicelli-maker, "there is that Old Goriot half-seas-over. He never thought of taking me anywhere, the old skinflint. But he will measure his length somewhere. My word! it is disgraceful to lose his senses like that, at his age! You will be telling me that he couldn't lose what he hadn't got. Sylvie, just take him up to his room!"

Sylvie took him by the arm, supported him upstairs, and flung him just as he was, like a package, across the bed.

"Poor young fellow!" said Mme. Couture, putting back Eugène's hair that had fallen over his eyes; "he is like a young girl, he does not know what dissipation is."

"Well, I can tell you this, I know," said Mme. Vauquer, "I have taken lodgers these thirty years, and a good many have passed through my hands, as the saying is, but I have never seen a nicer nor a more aristocratic looking young man than M. Eugène. How handsome he looks sleeping! Just let his head rest on your shoulder, Mme. Couture. Pshaw! he falls over towards Mlle. Victorine. There's a special providence for young things. A little more, and he would have broken his head against the knob of the chair. They'd make a pretty pair, those two would!"

"Hush, my good neighbor," cried Mme. Couture, "you are saying such things—"

"Pooh!" put in Mme. Vauquer, "he does not hear. Here, Sylvie! come and help me to dress. I shall put on my best stays."

"What! your best stays just after dinner, madame?" said Sylvie. "No, you can get someone else to lace you. I am not going to be your murderer. It's a rash thing to do, and might cost you your life."

"I don't care, I must do honor to M. Vautrin."

"Are you so fond of your heirs as all that?"

"Come, Sylvie, don't argue," said the widow, as she left the room.

"At her age, too!" said the cook to Victorine, pointing to her mistress as she spoke.

Mme. Couture and her ward were left in the dining-room, and Eugène slept on Victorine's shoulder. The sound of Christophe's snoring echoed through the silent house; Eugène's quiet breathing seemed all the quieter by force of contrast, he was sleeping as peacefully as a child. Victorine was very happy; she was free to perform one of those acts of charity which form an innocent outlet for all the overflowing sentiments of a woman's nature; he was so close to her that she could feel the throbbing of his heart; there was a look of almost maternal protection and conscious pride in Victorine's face. Among the countless thoughts that crowded up in her young innocent heart, there was a wild flutter of joy at this close contact.

"Poor, dear child!" said Mme. Couture, squeezing her hand.

The old lady looked at the girl. Victorine's innocent, pathetic face, so radiant with the new happiness that had befallen her, called to mind some naïve work of mediaeval art, when the painter neglected the accessories, reserving all the magic of his brush for the quiet, austere outlines and ivory tints of the face, which seems to have caught something of the golden glory of heaven.

"After all, he only took two glasses, mamma," said Victorine, passing her fingers through Eugène's hair.

"Indeed, if he had been a dissipated young man, child, he would have carried his wine like the rest of them. His drowsiness does him credit."

There was a sound of wheels outside in the street.

"There is M. Vautrin, mamma," said the girl. "Just take M. Eugène. I would rather not have that man see me like this; there are some ways of looking at you that seem to sully your soul and make you feel as though you had nothing on."

"Oh, no, you are wrong!" said Mme. Couture. "M. Vautrin is a worthy man; he reminds me a little of my late husband, poor dear M. Couture, rough but kind-hearted; his bark is worse than his bite."

Vautrin came in while she was speaking; he did not make a sound, but looked for a while at the picture of the two young faces—the lamplight falling full upon them seemed to caress them.

"Well," he remarked, folding his arms, "here is a picture! It would have suggested some pleasing pages to Bernardin de Saint-Pierre (good soul), who wrote Paul et Virginie. Youth is very charming, Mme. Couture! Sleep on, poor boy," he added, looking at Eugène, "luck sometimes comes while we are sleeping.—There is something touching and attractive to me about this young man, madame," he continued; "I know that his soul is as beautiful as his face. Just look, the head of a cherub on an angel's shoulder! He deserves to be loved. If I were a woman, I would die (no—not such a fool), I would live for him." He bent lower and spoke in the widow's ear. "When I see those two together, madame, I cannot help thinking that Providence meant them for each other; He works by secret ways, and scratches the heart and the strength of man," he said in a loud voice. "And when I see you, my children, thus united by a like purity and by all human affections, I say to myself that it is quite impossible that the future should separate you. God is just." He turned to Victorine. "It seems to me," he said, "that I have seen the line of success in your hand. Let me look at it, Mlle. Victorine; I am well up in palmistry, and I have told fortunes many a time. Come, now, don't be frightened. Ah! what do I see? Upon my word, you will be one of the richest heiresses in Paris before very long. You will heap riches on the man who loves you. Your father will want you to go and live with him. You will marry a young and handsome man with a title, who adores you."

The heavy footsteps of the coquettish widow, who was coming down the stairs, interrupted Vautrin's fortune-telling. "Here is Mamma Vauquerre, fair as a starr-r-r, dressed within an inch of her life. Aren't we a trifle pinched for room?" he inquired, with his arm round the lady; "we are screwed up very tightly about the bust, mamma! If we are much agitated, there may be an explosion; but I will pick up the fragments with all the care of an antiquary."

"There is a man who can talk the language of French gallantry!" said the widow, bending to speak in Mme. Couture's ear.

"Good-bye, my children!" said Vautrin, turning to Eugène and Victorine. "Bless you both!" and he laid a hand on either head. "Take my word for it, young lady, an honest man's prayers are worth something; they should bring you happiness, for God hears them."

"Good-bye, dear," said Mme. Vauquer to her lodger. "Do you think that M. Vautrin has intentions on my person?" she added, lowering her voice.

"Hem!" said the widow.

"Oh! mamma dear, suppose it should really happen as that kind M. Vautrin said!" said Victorine with a sigh, as she looked at her hands. The two women were alone together.

"Why, it wouldn't take much to bring it to pass," said the elderly lady; "just a fall from his horse, and your monster of a brother—"

"Oh! mamma."

"Good Lord! Well, perhaps it is a sin to wish bad luck to an enemy," the widow remarked. "I will do penance for it. Still, I would strew flowers on his grave with the greatest pleasure, and that is the truth. Black-hearted, that he is! The coward couldn't speak up for his own mother, and cheats you out of your share by deceit and trickery. My cousin had a pretty fortune of her own, but unluckily for you, nothing was said in the marriage contract about anything that she might come in for."

"It would be very hard if my good fortune is to cost someone else his life," said Victorine. "If I cannot be happy unless my brother is to be taken out of the world, I would rather stay here all my life."

"My God! it is just as that good M. Vautrin says, and he is full of piety, you see," Mme. Couture remarked. "I am very glad to find that he is not an unbeliever like the rest of them that talk of the Almighty with less respect than they do of the Devil. Well, as he was saying, who can know the ways by which it may please Providence to lead us?"

With Sylvie's help the two women at last succeeded in getting Eugène up to his room; they laid him on the bed, and the cook loosened his clothes to make him more comfortable. Before they left the room, Victorine snatched an opportunity when her guardian's back was turned, and pressed a kiss on Eugène's forehead, feeling all the joy that this stolen pleasure could give her. Then she went back to her own room, and gathering up, as it were, into one single thought all the untold bliss of that day, she made a picture of her memories, and dwelt upon it until she slept, the happiest creature in Paris.

That evening's merrymaking, in the course of which Vautrin had given the drugged wine to Eugène and Old Goriot, was his own ruin. Bianchon, flustered with wine, forgot to open the subject of Trompe-la-Mort with Mlle. Michonneau. The mere mention of the name would have set Vautrin on his guard; for Vautrin, or, to give him his real name, Jacques Collin, was in fact the notorious escaped convict.

But it was the joke about the graveyard Venus that finally decided his fate. Mlle. Michonneau had very nearly made up her mind to warn the convict and to throw herself on his generosity, with the idea of making a better bargain for herself by helping him to escape that night; but, as it was, she went out escorted by Poiret in search of the famous chief of detectives in the Petite Rue Saint-Anne, still thinking that it was the district superintendent— one Gondureau—with whom she had to do. The head of the department received his visitors courteously. There was a little talk, and the details were definitely arranged. Mlle. Michonneau asked for the draught that she was to administer in order to set about her investigation. But the great man's evident satisfaction set Mlle. Michonneau thinking; and she began to see that this business involved something more than the mere capture of a runaway convict. She racked her brains while he looked in a drawer in his desk for the little phial, and it dawned upon her that in consequence of treacherous revelations made by the prisoners the police were hoping to lay their hands on a considerable sum of money. But on hinting her suspicions to the old fox of the Petite Rue Sainte-Anne, that officer began to smile, and tried to put her off the scent.

"A delusion," he said. "Collin is the most dangerous sorbonne that has yet been found among the thieves. That is all, and the rascals are quite aware of it. They rally round him; he is the backbone of the federation, its Bonaparte, in short; he is very popular with them all. The rogue will never leave his tronche in the Place de Grève."

As Mlle. Michonneau seemed mystified, Gondureau explained the two slang words for her benefit. Sorbonne and tronche are two forcible expressions borrowed from thieves' Latin, thieves, of all people, being compelled to consider the human head in its two aspects. A sorbonne is the head of a living man, his faculty of thinking—his council; a tronche is a contemptuous epithet that implies how little a human head is worth after the axe has done its work.

"Collin is playing a game with us," he continued. "When we come across a man like a bar of steel tempered in the English fashion, there is always one resource left—we can kill him if he takes it into his head to make the least resistance. We are reckoning on several methods of killing Collin to-morrow morning. It saves a trial, and society is rid of him without all the expense of guarding and feeding him. What with getting up the case, summoning witnesses, paying their expenses, and carrying out the sentence, it costs a lot to go through all the proper formalities before you can get quit of one of these good-for-nothings, over and above the three thousand francs that you are going to have. There is a saving in time as well. One good thrust of the bayonet into Trompe-la-Mort's paunch will prevent scores of crimes, and save fifty scoundrels from following his example; they will be very careful to keep themselves out of the police courts. That is doing the work of the police thoroughly, and true philanthropists will tell you that it is better to prevent crime than to punish it."

"And you do a service to our country," said Poiret.

"Really, you are talking in a very sensible manner tonight, that you are," said the head of the department. "Yes, of course, we are serving our country, and we are very hardly used too. We do society very great services that are not recognized. In fact, a superior man must rise above vulgar prejudices, and a Christian must resign himself to the mishaps that doing right entails, when right is done in an out-of-the-way style. Paris is Paris, you see! That is the explanation of my life. I have the honor to wish you a good evening, mademoiselle. I shall bring my men to the Jardin du Roi in the morning. Send Christophe to the Rue du Buffon, tell him to ask for M. Gondureau in the house where you saw me before. Your servant, sir. If you should ever have anything stolen from you, come to me, and I will do my best to get it back for you."

"Well, now," Poiret remarked to Mlle. Michonneau, "there are idiots who are scared out of their wits by the word police. That was a very pleasant spoken gentleman, and what he wants you to do is as plain as saying ‘Good day.'"





The next day was destined to be one of the most extraordinary in the annals of Vauquer's. Hitherto the most startling occurrence in its tranquil existence had been the portentous, meteor-like apparition of the sham Comtesse de l'Ambermesnil. But the catastrophes of this great day were to cast all previous events into the shade, and supply an inexhaustible topic of conversation for Mme. Vauquer and her boarders so long as she lived.

In the first place, Goriot and Eugène de Rastignac both slept till close upon eleven o'clock. Mme. Vauquer, who came home about midnight from the Gaîté, lay abed till half-past ten. Christophe, after a prolonged slumber (he had finished Vautrin's first bottle of wine), was behindhand with his work, but Poiret and Mlle. Michonneau uttered no complaint, though breakfast was delayed. As for Victorine and Mme. Couture, they also slept late. Vautrin went out before eight o'clock, and only came back just as breakfast was ready. Nobody protested, therefore, when Sylvie and Christophe went up at a quarter past eleven, knocked at all the doors, and announced that breakfast was waiting. While Sylvie and the man were upstairs, Mlle. Michonneau, who came down first, poured the contents of the phial into the silver cup belonging to Vautrin—it was standing with the others in the boiler that kept the cream hot for the morning coffee. The old maid had reckoned on this particular arrangeement of the house for carrying out her design. The seven lodgers were at last gathered together, not without some difficulty. Just as Eugène came downstairs, stretching himself and yawning, a messenger handed him a letter from Mme. de Nucingen. It ran thus:


I feel neither false vanity nor anger where you are concerned, my friend. Till two o'clock this morning I waited for you. Oh, that waiting for one whom you love! No one that had passed through that torture could inflict it on another. I know now that you have never loved before. What can have happened? Anxiety has taken hold of me. I would have come myself to find out what had happened, if I had not feared to betray the secrets of my heart. How can I walk out or drive out at this time of day? Would it not be ruin? I have felt to the full how wretched it is to be a woman. Send a word to reassure me, and explain how it is that you have not come after what my father told you. I shall be angry, but I will forgive you. Are you ill? Why stay so far away? One word, for pity's sake. You will come to me very soon, will you not? If you are busy, a word will be enough. Say, "I will hasten to you," or else, "I am ill." But if you were ill my father would have come to tell me so. What can have happened?...



"Yes, indeed, what has happened?" exclaimed Eugène, and, hurrying down to the dining-room, he crumpled up the letter without reading any more. "What time is it?"

"Half-past eleven," said Vautrin, dropping a lump of sugar into his coffee.

The escaped convict cast a glance at Eugène, a cold and fascinating glance; men gifted with this magnetic power can quell furious lunatics in a madhouse by such a glance, it is said. Eugène shook in every limb. There was the sound of wheels in the street, and in another moment a man with a scared face rushed into the room. It was one of M. Taillefer's servants; Mme. Couture recognized the livery at once.

"Mademoiselle," he cried, "your father is asking for you—something terrible has happened! M. Frédéric has fought a duel and has been wounded in the forehead The doctors have given him up. You will scarcely be in time to say good-bye to him!—he is unconscious."

"Poor young fellow!" exclaimed Vautrin. "How can people brawl when they have a certain income of thirty thousand francs? Young people have bad manners, and that is a fact."

"Sir!" cried Eugène.

"Well, what then, you big baby!" said Vautrin, swallowing down his coffee imperturbably, an operation which Mlle. Michonneau watched with such close attention that she had no emotion to spare for the amazing news that had struck the others dumb with amazement. "Are there not duels every morning in Paris?" added Vautrin.

"I will go with you, Victorine," said Mme. Couture, and the two women hurried away at once without either hats or shawls. But before she went, Victorine, with her eyes full of tears, gave Eugène a glance that said, "How little I thought that our happiness should cost me tears!"

"Dear me, you are a prophet, M. Vautrin," said Mme. Vauquer.

"I am all sorts of things," said Jacques Collin.

"Queer, isn't it?" said Mme. Vauquer, stringing together a succession of commonplaces suited to the occasion. "Death takes us off without consulting our plans. The young often go before the old. It is a lucky thing for us women that we don't have to fight duels, but we have other complaints that men don't suffer from. We bear children, and it takes a long time to get over it. What a windfall for Victorine! Her father will have to acknowledge her now!"

"There!" said Vautrin, looking at Eugène, "yesterday she had not a penny; this morning she has several millions to her fortune."

"I say, M. Eugène!" cried Mme. Vauquer, "you have landed on your feet!"

At this exclamation, Old Goriot looked at the student, and saw the crumpled letter still in his hand.

"You have not read it through! What does this mean? Are you going to be like the rest of them?" he asked.

"Madame, I shall never marry Mlle. Victorine," said Eugène, turning to Mme. Vauquer with an expression of terror and loathing that surprised the onlookers at this scene.

Old Goriot caught the student's hand and grasped it warmly. He could have kissed it.

"Oh, ho!" said Vautrin, "the Italians have a good proverb—Col tempo."

"Is there any answer?" said Mme. de Nucingen's messenger, addressing Eugène.

"Say that I will come directly."

The man went. Eugène was in a state of such violent excitement that he could not be prudent.

"What is to be done?" he exclaimed aloud. "There are no proofs!"

Vautrin began to smile. Though the drug he had taken was doing its work, the convict was so vigorous that he rose to his feet, gave Rastignac a look, and said in hollow tones, "Luck comes to us while we sleep, my boy," and fell stiff and stark, as if he were struck dead.

"So there is a Divine Justice!" said Eugène.

"Well, if ever! What has happened to that poor dear M. Vautrin?"

"A stroke!" cried Mlle. Michonneau.

"Here, Sylvie! girl, run for the doctor," called the widow. "Oh, M. Rastignac, just go for M. Bianchon, and be as quick as you can; Sylvie might not be in time to catch our doctor, M. Grimprel."

Rastignac was glad of an excuse to leave that den of horrors; his hurry for the doctor was nothing but a flight.

"Here, Christophe, go round to the chemist's and ask for something that's good for the apoplexy."

Christophe obeyed.

"Old Goriot, just help us to get him upstairs."

They lifted Vantrin, and managed to get him to his room, where they put him on the bed.

"I can do no good here, so I shall go to see my daughter," said M. Goriot.

"Selfish old thing!" cried Mme. Vauquer. "Yes, go; I hope you may die like a dog yourself."

"Just go and see if you can find some ether," said Mlle. Michonneau to Mme. Vauquer; the former, with some help from Poiret, had loosened Vautrin's clothes.

Mme. Vauquer went down to her room, and left Mlle. Michonneau mistress of the situation.

"Now! just take off his shirt and turn him over, quick! You might try to keep me from seeing him stark naked," she said to Poiret, "instead of standing there with your mouth open."

Vautrin was turned over; Mlle. Michonneau gave his shoulder a sharp slap, and the two portentous letters appeared, white against the red.

"There, you have earned your three thousand francs very easily," exclaimed Poiret, supporting Vautrin while Mlle. Michonneau slipped on the shirt again. "Ouf! How heavy he is," he added, as he laid the convict down.

"Hush! Suppose there is a strong box here!" said the old maid briskly; her glances seemed to pierce the walls; she scrutinized every article of the furniture with greedy eyes. "Could we find some excuse for opening that desk?"

"It mightn't be quite right," responded Poiret to this.

"Where is the harm? It is money stolen from all sorts of people, so it doesn't belong to any one now. But we haven't time, there is the Vauquer."

"Here is the ether," said that lady. "I must say that this is an eventful day. Lord! that man can't have had a stroke; he is as white as a chicken."

"White as a chicken?" echoed Poiret.

"And his pulse is steady," said the widow, laying her hand on his breast.

"Steady?" said the astonished Poiret.

"He is all right."

"Do you think so?" asked Poiret.

"Lord! Yes, he looks as if he were sleeping. Sylvie has gone for a doctor. I say, Mlle. Michonneau, he is sniffing the ether. Pooh! it is only a spasm. His pulse is good. He is as strong as a Turk. Just look at the thick hair on his belly, mademoiselle, that is the sort of man to live till he is a hundred. His wig holds on tightly, however. Dear me, it is glued on, and his own hair is red; that is why he wears a wig. They always say that red-haired people are either the worst or the best. Is he one of the good ones, I wonder?"

"Good to hang," said Poiret.

"Round a pretty woman's neck, you mean," said Mlle Michonneau hastily. "Just go away, M. Poiret. It is a woman's duty to nurse you men when you are ill. Besides, for all the help you are you may as well take yourself off," she added. "Mme. Vauquer and I will take care for dear M. Vautrin."

Poiret went out on tiptoe without a murmur, like a dog kicked out of the room by his master.

Rastignac had gone out for the sake of physical exertion; he wanted to breathe the air, he felt stifled. Yesterday evening he had meant to prevent the murder arranged for half-past eight that morning. What had happened? What ought he to do now? He trembled to think that he himself might be implicated. Vautrin's coolness still further dismayed him.

"Suppose he should die without saying a word?" Rastignac asked himself.

He hurried along the paths of the Luxembourg Gardens as if the hounds of justice were after him, and he already heard the baying of the pack.

"Well?" shouted Bianchon, "you have seen the Pilot?"

The Pilot was a Radical sheet, edited by M. Tissot. It came out several hours later than the morning papers, and was meant for the benefit of country subscribers; for it brought the morning's news into provincial districts twenty-four hours sooner than the ordinary local journals.

"There is a wonderful story in it," said the house student of the Cochin Hopital. "Young Taillefer called out Count Franchessini, of the Old Guard, and the Count put a couple of inches of steel into his forehead. And here is little Victorine one of the richest heiresses in Paris! If we had known that, eh? What a game of chance death is! They say Victorine was sweet on you; was there any truth in it?"

"Shut up, Bianchon; I shall never marry her. I am in love with a charming woman, and she is in love with me, so—"

"You said that as if you were screwing yourself up to be faithful to her. I should like to see the woman worth the sacrifice of Master Taillefer's money!"

"Are all the devils of hell at my heels?" cried Rastignac.

"What is the matter with you? Are you mad? Give us your hand," said Bianchon, "and let me feel your pulse. You are feverish."

"Just go to Mother Vauquer's," said Rastignac; "that scoundrel Vautrin has dropped down like one dead."

"Aha!" said Bianchon, leaving Rastignac to his reflections, "you confirm my suspicions, and now I mean to make sure for myself."

The law student's long walk was a memorable one for him. He made in some sort a survey of his conscience. After a close scrutiny, after hesitation and self-examination, his honor at any rate came out scatheless from this sharp and terrible ordeal, like a bar of iron that is proof against every shock. He remembered Old Goriot's confidences of the evening before; he recollected the rooms taken for him in the Rue d'Artois, so that he might be near Delphine; and then he thought of his letter, and read it again and kissed it.

"Such a love is my anchor of safety," he said to himself. "How the old man's heart must have been wrung! He says nothing about all that he has been through; but who could not guess? Well, then, I will be like a son to him; his life shall be made happy. If she cares for me, she will often come to spend the day with him. That grand Comtesse de Restaud is a heartless thing; she would make her father into her hall porter. Dear Delphine! she is kinder to the old man; she is worthy to be loved. Ah! this evening I shall be very happy!"

He took out his watch and admired it.

"I have had nothing but success! If two people mean to love each other for ever, they may help each other, and I can take this. Besides, I shall succeed, and I will pay her a hundredfold. There is nothing criminal in this affair; nothing that could cause the most austere moralist to frown. How many respectable people contract similar unions! We deceive nobody; it is deception that makes a position humiliating. If you lie, you lower yourself at once. She and her husband have lived apart for a long while. Besides, suppose I called upon that Alsatian to give up a wife whom he cannot make happy?"

Rastignac's battle with himself went on for a long while; and though the scruples of youth inevitably gained the day, an irresistible curiosity led him, about half-past four, to return to Vauquer's through the gathering dusk. Though he had sworn to leave it for ever, he must know whether Vautrin were dead.

Bianchon had given Vautrin an emetic, reserving the contents of the stomach for chemical analysis at the hospital. Mlle. Michonneau's officious eagerness that they should be thrown away had still further strengthened his suspicions of her. Vautrin, moreover, had recovered so quickly, that it was impossible not to suspect some plot against the gay dog who was the life of the boarding-house. Vautrin was standing in front of the stove in the dining-room when Rastignac came in. All the lodgers were assembled sooner than usual beacuse of the news of young Taillefer's duel. They were curious to hear any detail about the affair, and to talk over the probable change in Victorine's prospects. Old Goriot alone was absent, but the rest were chatting. No sooner had Eugène come into the room, than his eyes met the inscrutable gaze of Vautrin. It was the same look that had read his thoughts before—the look that had such power to waken evil chords in his heart. He shuddered.

"Well, dear boy," said the convict, "I am likely to cheat death for a good while yet. According to these ladies, I have had a stroke that would have felled an ox, and come off with flying colors."

"A bull you might say," cried the widow.

"Perhaps you are sorry to see me still alive," said Vautrin in Rastignac's ear, thinking that he guessed the student's thoughts. "Maybe I'm a damned strong man."

"Mlle. Michonneau was talking the day before yesterday about a gentleman called Trompe-la-Mort," said Bianchon; "and, upon my word, that name would do very well for you."

Vautrin seemed thunderstruck. He turned pale, and staggered back. He turned his magnetic glance, like a ray of vivid light, on Mlle. Michonneau; the old maid shrank and trembled under the influence of that strong will, and collapsed into a chair. The mask of good nature had dropped from the convict's face; from the unmistakable ferocity of that sinister look, Poiret felt that the old maid was in danger, and hastily stepped between them. None of the lodgers understood this scene in the least, they looked on in mute amazement. There was a pause. Just then there was a sound of tramping feet outside; there were soldiers there, it seemed, for there was a ring of several rifles on the cobble stones of the street. Collin was mechanically looking round the walls for a way of escape, when four men entered by way of the sitting-room.

"In the name of the king and the law!" said an officer, but the words were almost lost in a murmur of astonishment.

Silence fell on the room. The lodgers made way for three of the men, who had each a hand on a cocked pistol in a side pocket. Two policemen, who followed the detectives, kept the entrance to the sitting-room, and two more appeared in the doorway that gave access to the staircase. A sound of footsteps came from the garden, and again the rifles of several soldiers rang on the cobble-stones under the window. All hope of flight was cut off from Trompe-la-Mort, on whom every eye instinctively turned. The chief walked straight up to him, and commenced operations by giving him a sharp blow on the head, so that the wig fell off, and Collin's face was revealed in all its ugliness. There was a terrible suggestion of strength mingled with cunning in the short, brick-red crop of hair, the whole head was in harmony with his powerful frame, and at that moment the fires of hell seemed to gleam from his eyes. In that flash the real Vautrin shone forth, revealed at once before them all; they understood his past, his present, and future, his pitiless doctrines, his actions, the religion of his own good pleasure, the majesty with which his cynicism and contempt for mankind invested him, the physical strength of an organization proof against all trials. The blood flew to his face, and his eyes glared like the eyes of a wild cat. He started back with savage energy and a fierce growl that drew exclamations of alarm from the lodgers. At that leonine start the police caught at their pistols under cover of the general clamor. Collin saw the gleaming muzzles of the weapons, saw his danger, and instantly gave proof of a power of the highest order. There was something horrible and majestic in the spectacle of the sudden transformation in his face; he could only be compared to a cauldron full of dense steam that can upheave mountains, a terrific force dispelled in a moment by a drop of cold water. The drop of water that cooled his wrathful fury was a reflection that flashed across his brain like lightning. He began to smile, and looked down at his wig.

"You are not very polite today," he remarked to the chief, and he held out his hands to the policemen with a jerk of his head.

"Gentlemen," he said, "put on the bracelets or the handcuffs. I call on those present to witness that I make no resistance."

A murmur of admiration ran through the room at the sudden outpouring like fire and lava flood from this human volcano, and its equally sudden cessation.

"That's something you didn't bargain for, wise guy," the convict added, looking at the famous director of police.

"Come, strip!" said he of the Petite Rue Saint-Anne, contemptuously.

"Why?" asked Collin. "There are ladies present; I deny nothing, and surrender."

He paused, and looked round the room like an orator who is about to overwhelm his audience.

"Take this down, Daddy Lachapelle," he went on, addressing a little, white-haired old man who had seated himself at the end of the table; and after drawing a printed form from the portfolio, was proceeding to draw up a document. "I acknowledge myself to be Jacques Collin, otherwise known as Trompe-la-Mort, condemned to twenty years' penal servitude, and I have just proved that I have come fairly by my nickname. If I had as much as raised my hand," he went on, addressing the other lodgers, "those three sneaking wretches yonder would have spilled blood on Mamma Vauquer's floor. The rogues have laid their heads together to set a trap for me."

Mme. Vauquer felt sick and faint at these words.

"Good Lord!" she cried, "this does give one a turn; and me at the Gaîté with him only last night!" she said to Sylvie.

"Summon your philosophy, mamma," Collin resumed. "Is it a misfortune to have sat in my box at the Gaîté yesterday evening? After all, are you better than we are? The brand upon our shoulders is less shameful than the brand set on your hearts, you flabby members of a society rotten to the core. Not the best man among you could stand up to me." His eyes rested upon Rastignac, to whom he spoke with a pleasant smile that seemed strangely at variance with the savage expression in his eyes. "Our little bargain still holds good, pretty boy; you can accept any time you like! Do you understand?" And he sang:


"A charming girl is my Fanchette

　 In her simplicity."



"Don't you trouble yourself," he went on; "I can get in my money. They are too much afraid of me to swindle me."

The convicts' prison, its language and customs, its sudden sharp transitions from the humorous to the horrible, its appalling grandeur, its triviality and its dark depths, were all revealed in turn by the speaker's discourse; he seemed to be no longer a man, but the type and mouthpiece of a degenerate race, a brutal, supple, clear-headed race of savages. In one moment Collin became the poet of an inferno, wherein all thoughts and passions that move human nature (save repentance) find a place. He looked about him like a fallen archangel who is for war to the end. Rastignac lowered his eyes, and acknowledged this kinship claimed by crime as an expiation of his own evil thoughts.

"Who betrayed me?" said Collin, and his terrible eyes traveled round the room. Suddenly they rested on Mlle. Michonneau.

"It was you, old whore!" he said. "That sham stroke of apoplexy was your doing, lynx eyes!... Two words from me, and your throat would be cut in less than a week, but I forgive you, I am a Christian. You did not sell me either. But who did—Aha! you may rummage upstairs!" he shouted, hearing the police officers opening his cupboards and taking possession of his effects. "The nest is empty, the birds flew away yesterday, and you will be none the wiser. My ledgers are here," he said, tapping his forehead. "Now I know who sold me! It could only be that son of a bitch Fil-de-Soie. That is who it was, old catch 'em, eh?" he said, turning to the chief. "It was timed so neatly to get the banknotes up there. There is nothing left for you—spies! As for Fil-de-Soie, he will be under the daisies in less than a fortnight, even if you were to tell off the whole force to protect him. How much did you give the Michonnette?" he asked of the police officers. "A thousand crowns? Oh you decayed Ninon, you tattered Pompadour, Venus of the graveyard, I was worth more than that! If you had given me warning, you should have had six thousand francs. Ah! you had no suspicion of that, old whoremonger, or I should have had the preference. Yes, I would have given six thousand francs to save myself an inconvenient journey and some loss of money," he said, as they fastened the handcuffs on his wrists. "These folks will amuse themselves by dragging out this business till the end of time to keep me idle! If they were to send me straight to jail, I should soon be back at my old tricks in spite of the duffers at the Quai des Orfèvres. Down yonder they will all turn themselves inside out to help their general—their good Trompe-la-Mort—to get clear away. Is there a single one among you that can say, as I can, that he has ten thousand brothers ready to do anything for him?" he asked proudly. "There is some good there," he said, tapping his heart; "I have never betrayed any one! Look you here, you slut," he said to the old maid, "they are all afraid of me, do you see, but the sight of you turns them sick. Rake in your gains."

He was silent for a moment, and looked round at the lodgers' faces.

"What fools you are, all of you! Have you never seen a convict before? A convict of Collin's stamp, whom you see before you, is a man less weak-kneed than others; he lifts up his voice against the colossal fraud of the Social Contract, as Jean Jacques did, whose pupil he is proud to declare himself. In short, I stand here single-handed against a Government and a whole subsidized machinery of tribunals and police, and I am a match for them all."

"Ye gods!" cried the painter, "what a magnificent model he would make!"

"Look here, you gentlemen-in-waiting to his highness the gibbet, master of ceremonies to the widow"—a nickname full of sombre poetry, given by prisoners to the guillotine—"be a good fellow, and tell me if it really was Fil-de-Soie who sold me. I don't want him to suffer for someone else, that would not be fair."

But before the chief had time to answer, the rest of the party returned from making their investigations upstairs. Everything had been opened and inventoried. A few words passed between them and the chief, and the official preliminaries were complete.

"Gentlemen," said Collin, addressing the lodgers, "they will take me away directly. You have all made my stay among you very agreeable, and I shall look back upon it with gratitude. Receive my adieux, and permit me to send you figs from Provence."

He advanced a step or two, and then turned to look once more at Rastignac.

"Good-bye, Eugène," he said, in a sad and gentle tone, a strange transition from his previous rough and stern manner. "If you should be hard up, I have left you a devoted friend," and, in spite of his shackles, he managed to assume a posture of defence, called, "One, two!" like a fencing master, and lunged. "If anything goes wrong, apply in that quarter. Man and money, all at your service."

The strange speaker's manner was sufficiently burlesque, so that no one but Rastignac knew that there was a serious meaning underlying the pantomime.

As soon as the police, soldiers, and detectives had left the house, Sylvie, who was rubbing her mistress' temples with vinegar, looked round at the bewildered lodgers.

"Well," said she, "he was a man, he was, for all that."

Her words broke the spell. Every one had been too much excited, too much moved by very various feelings to speak. But now the lodgers began to look at each other, and then all eyes were turned at once on Mlle. Michonneau, a thin, shriveled, dead-alive, mummy-like figure crouching by the stove; her eyes were downcast, as if she feared that the green eye-shade could not shut out the expression of those faces from her. This figure and the feeling of repulsion she had so long excited were explained all at once. A smothered murmur filled the room; it was so unanimous, that it seemed as if the same feeling of loathing had pitched all the voices in one key. Mlle. Michonneau heard it, and did not stir. It was Bianchon who was the first to move; he bent over his neighbor, and said in a low voice, "If that creature is going to stop here, and have dinner with us, I shall clear out."

In the twinkling of an eye it was clear that every one in the room, save Poiret, was of the medical student's opinion, so that the latter, strong in the support of the majority, went up to that elderly person.

"You are more intimate with Mlle. Michonneau than the rest of us," he said; "speak to her, make her understand that she must go, and go at once."

"At once!" echoed Poiret in amazement.

Then he went across to the old woman, and spoke a few words in her ear.

"I have paid beforehand for the quarter; I have as much right to be here as any one else," she said, with a viperous look at the boarders.

"Never mind that! We will club together and pay you the money back," said Rastignac.

"Monsieur is taking Collin's part," she said, with a questioning, malignant glance at the law student; "it is not difficult to guess why."

Eugène started forward at the words, as if he meant to spring upon her and wring her neck. That glance, and the depths of treachery that it revealed, had been a hideous enlightenment.

"Let her alone!" cried the boarders.

Rastignac folded his arms, and was silent.

"Let us have no more of Mlle. Judas," said the painter, turning to Mme. Vauquer. "If you don't show the Michonneau the door, madame, we shall all leave your hovel, and wherever we go we shall say that there are only convicts and spies left there. If you do the other thing, we will hold our tongues about the business; for when all is said and done, it might happen in the best society until they brand them on the forehead, when they send them to the galleys. They ought not to let convicts go about Paris disguised like decent citizens, so as to carry on their antics like a set of rascally humbugs, which they are."

At this Mme. Vauquer recovered miraculously. She sat up and folded her arms; her eyes were wide open now, and there was no sign of tears in them.

"Why, do you really mean to be the ruin of my establishment, my dear sir? There is M. Vautrin—Goodness," she cried, interrupting herself, "I can't help calling him by the name he passed himself off by for an honest man! There is one room to let already, and you want me to turn out two more lodgers in the middle of the season, when no one is moving—"

"Gentlemen, let us take our hats and go and dine at Flicoteaux's in the Place Sorbonne," cried Bianchon.

Mme. Vauquer glanced round, and saw in a moment on which side her interest lay. She waddled across to Mlle. Michonneau.

"Come, now," she said; "you would not be the ruin of my establishment, would you, eh? There's a dear, kind soul. You see what a pass these gentlemen have brought me to; just go up to your room for this evening."

"Never a bit of it!" cried the boarders. "She must go, and go this minute!"

"But the poor lady has had no dinner," said Poiret, with piteous entreaty.

"She can go and dine where she likes," shouted several voices.

"Turn her out, the spy!"

"Turn them both out! Spies!"

"Gentlemen," cried Poiret, his heart swelling with the courage of a lovesick ram, "respect the weaker sex."

"Spies are of no sex!" said the painter.

"A precious sexorama!"

"Turn her into the streetorama!"

"Gentlemen, this is not manners! If you turn people out of the house, it ought not to be done so unceremoniously and with no notice at all. We have paid our money, and we are not going," said Poiret, putting on his cap, and taking a chair beside Mlle. Michonneau, with whom Mme. Vauquer was remonstrating.

"Naughty boy!" said the painter, with a comical look; "run away, naughty little boy!"

"Look here," said Bianchon; "if you do not go, all the rest of us will," and the boarders, to a man, made for the sitting-room door.

"Oh! mademoiselle, what is to be done?" cried Mme. Vauquer. "I am a ruined woman. You can't stay here; they will go further, do something violent."

Mlle. Michonneau rose to her feet.

"She is going!—She is not going!—She is going!—No, she isn't."

These alternate exclamations, and a suggestion of hostile intentions, borne out by the behavior of the insurgents, compelled Mlle. Michonneau to take her departure. She made some stipulations, speaking in a low voice in her hostess' ear, and then: "I shall go to Mme. Buneaud's," she said, with a threatening look.

"Go where you please, mademoiselle," said Mme. Vauquer, who regarded this choice of an opposition establishment as an atrocious insult. "Go and lodge with the Buneaud; the wine would make a goat sick, and the food is second-hand."

The boarders stood aside in two rows to let her pass; not a word was spoken. Poiret looked so wistfully after Mlle. Michonneau, and so artlessly revealed that he was in two minds whether to go or stay, that the boarders, in their joy at being quit of Mlle. Michonneau, burst out laughing at the sight of him.

"Hist!—st!—st! Poiret," shouted the painter. "Hallo! I say, Poiret, hallo!" The employe from the Museum began to sing:


"Leaving port for Syria,

That fine young man Dunois..."



"Get along with you; you must be dying to go, trahit sua quemque voluptas!" said Bianchon.

"Every one to his taste—free rendering from Virgil," said the tutor.

Mlle. Michonneau made a movement as if to take Poiret's arm, with an appealing glance that he could not resist. The two went out together, the old maid leaning upon him, and there was a burst of applause, followed by peals of laughter.

"Bravo, Poiret!"

"Who would have thought it of old Poiret!"

"Apollo Poiret!"

"Mars Poiret!"

"Intrepid Poiret!"

A messenger came in at that moment with a letter for Mme. Vauquer, who read it through, and collapsed in her chair.

"The house might as well be burned down at once," cried she, "if there are to be any more of these thunderbolts! Young Taillefer died at three o'clock this afternoon. It serves me right for wishing well to those ladies at that poor man's expense. Mme. Couture and Victorine want me to send their things, because they are going to live with her father. M. Taillefer allows his daughter to keep old Mme. Couture with her as lady companion. Four rooms to let! and five lodgers gone!..."

She sat up, and seemed about to burst into tears.

"Bad luck has come to lodge here, I think," she cried.

Once more there came a sound of wheels from the street outside.

"What! another windfall for somebody!" was Sylvie's comment.

But it was Goriot who came in, looking so radiant, so flushed with happiness, that he seemed to have grown young again.

"Goriot in a cab!" cried the boarders; "the world is coming to an end."

The good soul made straight for Eugène, who was standing wrapt in thought in a corner, and laid a hand on the young man's arm.

"Come," he said, with gladness in his eyes.

"Then you haven't heard the news?" said Eugène. "Vautrin was an escaped convict; they have just arrested him; and young Taillefer is dead."

"Very well, but what business is it of ours?" replied Old Goriot. "I am going to dine with my daughter in your house, do you understand? She is expecting you. Come!"

He carried off Rastignac with him by main force, and they departed in as great a hurry as a pair of eloping lovers.

"Now, let us have dinner," cried the painter, and every one drew his chair to the table.

"Well, I never," said the portly Sylvie. "Nothing goes right today! The mutton stew has stuck to the bottom of the pan! Bah! you will have to eat it, burnt as it is, so much the worse for you!"

Mme. Vauquer was so dispirited that she could not say a word as she looked round the table and saw only ten people where eighteen should be; but every one tried to comfort and cheer her. At first the dinner contingent, as was natural, talked about Vautrin and the day's events; but the conversation wound round to such topics of interest as duels, jails, justice, prison life, and alterations that ought to be made in the laws. They soon wandered miles away from Jacques Collin and Victorine and her brother. There might be only ten of them, but they made noise enough for twenty; indeed, there seemed to be more of them than usual; that was the only difference between yesterday and today. Indifference to the fate of others is a matter of course in this selfish world, which, on the morrow of tragedy, seeks among the events of Paris for a fresh sensation for its daily renewed appetite, and this indifference soon gained the upper hand. Mme. Vauquer herself grew calmer under the soothing influence of hope, and the mouthpiece of hope was the portly Sylvie.

That day had gone by like a dream for Eugène, and the sense of unreality lasted into the evening; so that, in spite of his energetic character and clear-headedness, his ideas were a chaos as he sat beside Goriot in the cab. The old man's voice was full of unwonted happiness, but Eugène had been shaken by so many emotions that the words sounded in his ears like words spoken in a dream.

"It was finished this morning! All three of us are going to dine there together, together! Do you understand? I have not dined with my Delphine, my little Delphine, these four years, and I shall have her for a whole evening! We have been at your lodging the whole time since morning. I have been working like a porter in my shirt-sleeves, helping to carry in the furniture. Aha! you don't know what pretty ways she has; at table she will look after me, 'Here, papa, just try this, it is nice.' And I shall not be able to eat. Oh, it is a long while since I have been with her in quiet every day life as we shall have her."

"It really seems as if the world had been turned upside down."

"Upside down?" repeated Old Goriot. "Why, the world has never been so right-side up. I see none but smiling faces in the streets, people who shake hands cordially and embrace each other, people who all look as happy as if they were going to dine with their daughter, and gobble down a nice little dinner that she went with me to order of the chef at the Café des Anglais. But, pshaw! with her beside you gall and wormwood would be as sweet as honey."

"I feel as if I were coming back to life again," said Eugène.

"Hurry up there, driver!" cried Old Goriot, letting down the window in front. "Drive faster; I will give you five francs if you get to the place I told you of in ten minutes' time."

With this prospect before him the cabman crossed Paris with miraculous celerity.

"How that fellow crawls!" said Old Goriot.

"But where are you taking me?" Eugène asked him.

"To your own house," said Goriot.

The cab stopped in the Rue d'Artois. Old Goriot stepped out first and flung ten francs to the man with the recklessness of a widower returning to bachelor ways.

"Come along upstairs," he said to Rastignac. They crossed a courtyard, and climbed up to the third floor of a new and handsome house. Here they stopped before a door; but before Goriot could ring, it was opened by Thérèse, Mme. de Nucingen's maid. Eugène found himself in a charming set of chambers; an ante-room, a little drawing-room, a bedroom, and a study, looking out upon a garden. The furniture and the decoration of the little drawing-room were of the most daintily charming description, the room was full of soft light, and Delphine rose up from a low chair by the fire and stood before him. She set her fire-screen down in the chimney-piece, and spoke with tenderness in every tone of her voice.

"So we had to go in search of you, sir, you who are so slow to understand!"

Thérèse left the room. The student took Delphine in his arms and held her in a tight clasp, his eyes filled with tears of joy. This last contrast between his present surroundings and the scenes he had just witnessed was too much for Rastignac's overwrought nerves, after the day's strain and excitement that had wearied heart and brain; he was almost overcome by it.

"I felt sure myself that he loved you," murmured Old Goriot, while Eugène lay back bewildered on the sofa, utterly unable to speak a word or to reason out how and why the magic wand had been waved to bring about this final transformation scene.

"But you must see your rooms," said Mme. de Nucingen. She took his hand and led him into a room carpeted and furnished like her own; indeed, down to the smallest details, it was a reproduction in miniature of Delphine's apartment.

"There is no bed," said Rastignac.

"No, monsieur," she answered, reddening, and pressing his hand. Eugène, looking at her, understood, young though he yet was, how deeply modesty is implanted in the heart of a woman who loves.

"You are one of those beings whom we cannot choose but to adore for ever," he said in her ear. "Yes, the deeper and truer love is, the more mysterious and closely veiled it should be; I can dare to say so, since we understand each other so well. No one shall learn our secret."

"Oh! so I am nobody, I suppose," growled the father.

"You know quite well that 'we' means you."

"Ah! that is what I wanted. You will not mind me, will you? I shall go and come like a good fairy who makes himself felt everywhere without being seen, shall I not? Eh, Delphinette, Ninette, Dedel—was it not a good idea of mine to say to you, 'There are some nice rooms to let in the Rue d'Artois; let us furnish them for him?' And she would not hear of it! Ah! your happiness has been all my doing. I am the author of your happiness and of your existence. Fathers must always be giving if they would be happy themselves; always giving—they would not be fathers else."

"Was that how it happened?" asked Eugène.

"Yes. She would not listen to me. She was afraid that people would talk, as if the rubbish that they say about you were to be compared with happiness! Why, all women dream of doing what she has done—"

Old Goriot found himself without an audience, for Mme. de Nucingen had led Rastignac into the study; he heard a kiss given and taken, low though the sound was.

The study was furnished as elegantly as the other rooms, and nothing was wanting there.

"Have we guessed your wishes rightly?" she asked, as they returned to the drawing-room for dinner.

"Yes," he said, "only too well, alas! For all this luxury so well carried out, this realization of pleasant dreams, the elegance that satisfies all the romantic fancies of youth, appeals to me so strongly that I cannot but feel that it is my rightful possession, but I cannot accept it from you, and I am too poor as yet to—"

"Ah! are you resisting?" she said with arch imperiousness, and a charming little pout of the lips, a woman's way of laughing away scruples.

But Eugène had submitted so lately to that solemn self-questioning, and Vautrin's arrest had so plainly shown him the depths of the pit that lay ready to his feet, that the instincts of generosity and honor had been strengthened in him, and he could not allow himself to be coaxed into abandoning his high-minded determinations. Profound sadness took possession of him.

"Do you really mean to refuse?" said Mme. de Nucingen. "And do you know what such a refusal means? That you are not sure of yourself, that you do not dare to bind yourself to me. Are you really afraid of betraying my affection? If you love me, if I—love you, why should you shrink back from such a slight obligation? If you but knew what a pleasure it has been to see after all the arrangements of this bachelor establishment, you would not hesitate any longer, you would ask me to forgive you for your hesitation. I had some money that belonged to you, and I have made good use of it, that is all. You mean this for magnanimity, but it is very little of you. You are asking me for far more than this.... Ah!" she cried, as Eugène's passionate glance was turned on her, "and you are making difficulties about the merest trifles. Of, if you feel no love whatever for me, refuse, by all means. My fate hangs on a word from you. Speak! Father," she said after a pause, "make him listen to reason. Does he think that I am less jealous of our honor than he?"

Old Goriot was looking on and listening to this pretty quarrel with the fixed smile of an opium eater.

"Child that you are!" she cried again, catching Eugène's hand. "You are just beginning life; you find barriers at the outset that many a man finds insurmountable; a woman's hand opens the way, and you shrink back! Why, you are sure to succeed! You will have a brilliant future. Success is written on that broad forehead of yours, and will you not be able to repay me my loan of today? Did not a lady in olden times arm her knight with sword and helmet and coat of mail, and find him a charger, so that he might fight for her in the tournament? Well, then, Eugène, these things that I offer you are the weapons of this age; every one who means to be something must have such tools as these. A pretty place your garret must be if it is like papa's room! See, dinner is waiting all this time. Do you want to make me unhappy?—Why don't you answer?" she said, shaking his hand. Heavens! papa, make up his mind for him, or I will go away and never see him any more."

"I will make up your mind," said Goriot, coming down from the clouds. "Now, my dear M. Eugène, the next thing is to borrow money of the Jews, isn't it?"

"There is positively no help for it," said Eugène.

"All right, I will give you credit," said the other, drawing out a cheap leather pocket-book, much the worse for wear. "I have turned Jew myself; I paid for everything; here are the invoices. You do not owe a penny for anything here. It did not come to very much—five thousand francs at most, and I am going to lend you the money myself. I am not a woman—you can refuse me. You shall give me a receipt on a scrap of paper, and you can return it some time or other."

Delphine and Eugène looked at each other in amazement, tears sprang to their eyes. Rastignac held out his hand and grasped Goriot's warmly.

"Well, what is all this about? Are you not my children?"

"Oh! my poor father," said Mme. de Nucingen, "how did you do it?"

"Ah! now you ask me. When I made up my mind to move him nearer to you, and saw you buying things as if they were wedding presents, I said to myself, 'She will never be able to pay for them.' The attorney says that those law proceedings will last quite six months before your husband can be made to return your fortune. Well and good. I sold my government stock that brought in thirteen hundred and fifty livres a year, and bought a safe annuity of twelve hundred francs a year for fifteen thousand francs. Then I paid your tradesmen out of the rest of the capital. As for me, children, I have a room upstairs for which I pay fifty crowns a year; I can live like a prince on two francs a day, and still have something left over. I shall not have to spend anything much on clothes, for I never wear anything out. This fortnight past I have been laughing in my sleeve, thinking to myself, ‘How happy they are going to be!' and—well, now, are you not happy?"

"Oh, papa! papa!" cried Mme. de Nucingen, springing to her father, who took her on his knee. She covered him with kisses, her fair hair brushed his cheek, her tears fell on the withered face that had grown so bright and radiant.

"Dear father, what a father you are! No, there is not another father like you under the sun. If Eugène loved you before, what must he feel for you now?"

"Why, children! why, Delphinette!" cried Goriot, who had not felt his daughter's heart beat against his breast for ten years, "do you want me to die of joy? My poor heart will break! Come, M. Eugène, we are quits already." And the old man strained her to his breast with such fierce and passionate force that she cried out.

"Oh! you are hurting me!" she said.

"I am hurting you!" He grew pale at the words. The pain expressed in his face seemed greater than it is given to humanity to know. The agony of this Christ of paternity can only be compared with the masterpieces of those princes of the palette who have left for us the record of their visions of an agony suffered for a whole world by the Saviour of men. Old Goriot pressed his lips very gently against the waist that his fingers had grasped too roughly.

"Oh! no, no," he cried. "I have not hurt you, have I?" and his smile seemed to repeat the question. "You have hurt me with that cry just now. The things cost rather more than that," he said in her ear, with another gentle kiss, "but I had to deceive him about it, or he would have been angry."

Eugène sat dumb with amazement in the presence of this inexhaustible love; he gazed at Goriot, and his face betrayed the artless admiration which shapes the beliefs of youth.

"I will be worthy of all this," he cried.

"Oh! my Eugène, that is nobly said," and Mme. de Nucingen kissed the law student on the forehead.

"He gave up Mlle. Taillefer and her millions for you," said Old Goriot. "Yes, the little thing was in love with you, and now that her brother is dead she is as rich as Croesus."

"Oh! why did you tell her?" cried Rastignac.

"Eugène," Delphine said in his ear, "I have one regret now this evening. Ah! how I will love you! and for ever!"

"This is the happiest day I have had since you two were married!" cried Goriot. "God may send me any suffering, so long as I do not suffer through you, and I can still say, 'In this short month of February I had more happiness than other men have in their whole lives.' Look at me, Fifine!" he said to his daughter. "She is very beautiful, is she not? Tell me, now, have you seen many women with that pretty soft color—that little dimple of hers? No, I thought not. Ah well, and but for me this lovely woman would never have been. And very soon happiness will make her a thousand times lovelier, happiness through you. I could give up my place in heaven to you, neighbor, if needs be, and go down to hell instead. Come, let us have dinner," he added, scarcely knowing what he said, "everything is ours."

"Poor dear father!"

He rose and went over to her, and took her face in his hands, and set a kiss on the plaits of hair. "If you only knew, little one, how happy you can make me—how little it takes to make me happy! Will you come and see me sometimes? I shall be just above, so it is only a step. Promise me, say that you will!"

"Yes, dear father."

"Say it again."

"Yes, I will, my kind father."

"Hush! hush! I should make you say it a hundred times over if I followed my own wishes. Let us have dinner."

The three behaved like children that evening, and Old Goriot's spirits were certainly not the least wild. He lay at his daughter's feet, kissed them, gazed into her eyes, rubbed his head against her dress; in short, no young lover could have been more extravagant or more tender.

"You see!" Delphine said with a look at Eugène, "so long as my father is with us, he monopolizes me. He will be rather in the way sometimes."

Eugène had himself already felt certain twinges of jealousy, and could not blame this speech that contained the germ of all ingratitude.

"And when will the rooms be ready?" asked Eugène, looking round. "We must all leave them this evening, I suppose."

"Yes, but to-morrow you must come and dine with me," she answered, with an eloquent glance. "It is our night at the Italiens."

"I shall go to the pit," said her father.

It was midnight. Mme. de Nucingen's carriage was waiting for her, and Old Goriot and the student walked back to the Maison Vauquer, talking of Delphine, and warming over their talk till there grew up a curious rivalry between the two violent passions. Eugène could not help seeing that the father's selfless love was deeper and more steadfast than his own. For this worshiper Delphine was always pure and fair, and her father's adoration drew its fervor from a whole past as well as a future of love.

They found Mme. Vauquer by the stove, with Sylvie and Christophe to keep her company; the old landlady, sitting like Marius among the ruins of Carthage, was waiting for the two lodgers that yet remained to her, and bemoaning her lot with the sympathetic Sylvie. Tasso's lamentations as recorded in Byron's poem are undoubtedly eloquent, but for sheer force of truth they fall far short of the widow's cry from the depths.

"Only three cups of coffee in the morning, Sylvie! Oh dear! to have your house emptied in this way is enough to break your heart. What is life, now my lodgers are gone? Nothing at all. Just think of it! It is just as if all the furniture had been taken out of the house, and your furniture is your life. How have I offended Heaven to draw down all this trouble upon me? And haricot beans and potatoes laid in for twenty people! The police in my house, too! We shall have to live on potatoes now, and Christophe will have to go!"

The Savoyard, who was fast asleep, suddenly woke up at this, and said, "Madame?" questioningly.

"Poor fellow!" said Sylvie, "he is like a watch-dog."

"In the dead season, too! Nobody is moving now. I would like to know where the lodgers are to drop down from. It drives me distracted. And that old witch of a Michonneau goes and takes Poiret with her! What can she have done to make him so fond of her? He runs about after her like a poodle."

"Lord!" said Sylvie, flinging up her head, "those old maids are up to all sorts of tricks."

"There's that poor M. Vautrin that they made out to be a convict," the widow went on. "Well, you know that is too much for me, Sylvie; I can't bring myself to believe it. Such a lively man as he was, and paid fifteen francs a month for his coffee of an evening, paid you to the last penny, too."

"And open-handed he was!" said Christophe.

"There is some mistake," said Sylvie.

"Why, no there isn't! he said so himself!" said Mme. Vauquer. "And to think that all these things have happened in my house, and in a quarter where you never see a cat go by. On my word as an honest woman, it's like a dream. For, look here, we saw Louis XVI meet with his mishap; we saw the fall of the Emperor; and we saw him come back and fall again; there was nothing out of the way in all that, but lodging-houses are not liable to revolutions. You can do without a king, but you must eat all the same; and so long as a decent woman, a de Conflans born and bred, will give you all sorts of good things for dinner, nothing short of the end of the world ought to—but there, it is the end of the world, that is just what it is!"

"And to think that Mlle. Michonneau who made all this mischief is to have a thousand crowns a year for it, so I hear," cried Sylvie.

"Don't speak of her, she is a wicked woman!" said Mme. Vauquer. "She is going to the Buneaud, who charges less than cost. But the Buneaud is capable of anything; she must have done frightful things, robbed and murdered people in her time. She ought to be put in jail for life instead of that poor dear—"

Eugène and Goriot rang the door-bell at that moment.

"Ah! here are my two faithful lodgers," said the widow, sighing.

But the two faithful lodgers, who retained but shadowy recollections of the misfortunes of their lodging-house, announced to their hostess without more ado that they were about to remove to the Chaussée d'Antin.

"Sylvie!" cried the widow, "this is the last straw. Gentlemen, this will be the death of me! It has quite upset me! There's a weight on my chest! I am ten years older for this day! Upon my word, I shall go out of my senses! And what is to be done with the beans!—Oh, well, if I am to be left here all by myself, you shall go to-morrow, Christophe. Good-night, gentlemen," and she went.

"What is the matter now?" Eugène inquired of Sylvie.

"Lord! everybody has left because of what happened, and that has addled her wits. There! she is crying upstairs. It will do her good to snivel a bit. It's the first time she has cried since I've been with her."

By the morning, Mme. Vauquer, to use her own expression, had "made up her mind to it." True, she still wore a doleful countenance, as might be expected of a woman who had lost all her lodgers, and whose manner of life had been suddenly revolutionized, but she had all her wits about her. Her grief was genuine and profound; it was real pain of mind, for her purse had suffered, the routine of her existence had been broken. A lover's farewell glance at his lady-love's window is not more mournful than Mme. Vauquer's survey of the empty places round her table. Eugène administered comfort, telling the widow that Bianchon, whose term of residence at the hospital was about to expire, would doubtless take his (Rastignac's)place; that the official from the Museum had often expressed a desire to have Mme. Couture's rooms; and that in a very few days her household would be on the old footing.

"God grant it may be so, my dear sir! but bad luck has come to lodge here. There'll be a death in the house before ten days are out, you'll see," and she gave a lugubrious look round the dining-room. "Whose turn will it be, I wonder?"

"It is just as well that we are moving out," said Eugène to Old Goriot in a low voice.

"Madame," said Sylvie, running in with a scared face, "I have not seen Mistigris these three days."

"Ah! well, if my cat is dead, if he has gone and left us, I—"

The poor woman could not finish her sentence; she clasped her hands and hid her face on the back of her armchair, quite overcome by this dreadful portent.

By twelve o'clock, when the postman reaches that quarter, Eugène received a letter. The dainty envelope bore the Beauséant arms on the seal, and contained an invitation to the Vicomtesse's great ball, which had been talked of in Paris for a month. A little note for Eugène was slipped in with the card.


I think, monsieur, that you will undertake with pleasure to interpret my sentiments to Mme. de Nucingen, so I am sending the card for which you asked me to you. I shall be delighted to make the acquaintance of Mme. de Restaud's sister. Pray introduce that charming lady to me, and do not let her monopolize all your affection, for you owe me not a little in return for mine.

VICOMTESSE DE BEAUSÉANT.



"Well," said Eugène to himself, as he read the note a second time, "Mme. de Beauséant says pretty plainly that she does not want the Baron de Nucingen."

He went to Delphine at once in his joy. He had procured this pleasure for her, and doubtless he would receive the price of it. Mme. de Nucingen was dressing. Rastignac waited in her boudoir, enduring as best he might the natural impatience of an eager temperament for the reward desired and withheld for a year. Such sensations are only known once in a life. The first woman to whom a man is drawn, if she is really a woman—that is to say, if she appears to him amid the splendid accessories that form a necessary background to life in the world of Paris—will never have a rival.

Love in Paris is a thing distinct and apart; for in Paris neither men nor women are the dupes of the commonplaces by which people seek to throw a veil over their motives, or to parade a fine affectation of disinterestedness in their sentiments. In this country within a country, it is not merely required of a woman that she should satisfy the senses and the soul; she knows perfectly well that she has still greater obligations to discharge, that she must fulfil the countless demands of a vanity that enters into every fibre of that living organism called society. Love, for her, is above all things, and by its very nature, a vainglorious, brazen-fronted, ostentatious, thriftless charlatan. If at the Court of Louis XIV there was not a woman but envied Mlle. de la Vallière the reckless devotion of passion that led the grand monarch to tear the priceless ruffles at his wrists in order to assist the entry of a Duc de Vermandois into the world—what can you expect of the rest of society? You must have youth and wealth and rank; nay, you must, if possible, have more than these, for the more incense you bring with you to burn at the shrine of the god, the more favorably will he regard the worshiper. Love is a religion, and his cult must in the nature of things be more costly than those of all other deities; Love stays for a moment, and then passes on; like a wanton boy, his course may be traced by the ravages that he has made. The wealth of feeling and imagination is the poetry of the garret; how should love exist there without that wealth?

If there are exceptions to these Draconian laws of the Parisian code, they are solitary examples. Such souls live so far out of the main current that they are not borne away by the doctrines of society; they dwell beside some clear spring of ever-flowing water, without seeking to leave the green shade; happy to listen to the echoes of the infinite in everything around them and in their own souls, waiting in patience to take their wings to grow, while they look with pity upon those of earth.

Rastignac, like most young men who have been early impressed by the circumstances of power and grandeur, meant to enter the lists fully armed; the burning ambition of conquest possessed him already; perhaps he was conscious of his powers, but as yet he knew neither the end to which his ambition was to be directed, nor the means of attaining it. In default of the pure and sacred love that fills a life, ambition may become something very noble, subduing to itself every thought of personal interest, and setting as the end—the greatness, not of one man, but of a whole nation.

But the student had not yet reached the time of life when a man surveys the whole course of existence and judges it soberly. Hitherto he had scarcely so much as shaken off the spell of the fresh and gracious influences that envelop a childhood in the country, like green leaves and grass. He had hesitated on the brink of the Parisian Rubicon, and in spite of the prickings of ambition, he still clung to a lingering tradition of an old ideal—the peaceful life of the noble in his château. But yesterday evening, at the sight of his rooms, those scruples had vanished. He had learned what it was to enjoy the material advantages of fortune, as he had already enjoyed the social advantages of birth; he ceased to be a provincial from that moment, and slipped naturally and easily into a position which opened up a prospect of a brilliant future.

So, as he waited for Delphine, in the pretty boudoir, where he felt that he had a certain right to be, he felt himself so far away from the Rastignac who came back to Paris a year ago, that, turning some power of inner vision upon this latter, he asked himself whether that past self bore any resemblance to the Rastignac of that moment.

"Madame is in her room," Thérèse came to tell him. The woman's voice made him start.

He found Delphine lying back in her low chair by the fireside, looking fresh and bright. The sight of her among the flowing draperies of muslin suggested some beautiful tropical flower, where the fruit is set amid the blossom.

"Well," she said, with a tremor in her voice, "here you are."

"Guess what I bring for you," said Eugène, sitting down beside her. He took possession of her arm to kiss her hand.

Mme. de Nucingen gave a joyful start as she saw the card. She turned to Eugène; there were tears in her eyes as she flung her arms about his neck, and drew him towards her in a frenzy of gratified vanity.

"And I owe this happiness to you—to thee" —she whispered the more intimate word in his ear—"but Thérèse is in my dressing-room, let us be prudent.—This happiness—yes, for I may call it so, when it comes to me through you—is surely more than a triumph for self-love? No one has been good enough to introduce me into that set. Perhaps just now I may seem to you to be frivolous, petty, shallow, like a Parisienne, but remember, my friend, that I am ready to give up all for you; and that if I long more than ever for an entrance into the Faubourg Saint-Germain, it is because I shall meet you there."

"Mme. de Beauséant's note seems to say very plainly that she does not expect to see the Baron de Nucingen at her ball; don't you think so?" said Eugène.

"Why, yes," said the Baroness as she returned the letter. "Those women have a talent for insolence. But it is of no consequence, I shall go. My sister is sure to be there, and sure to be very beautifully dressed. Eugène," she went on, lowering her voice, "she will go to dispel ugly suspicions. You do not know the things that people are saying about her! Only this morning Nucingen came to tell me that they had been discussing her at the club. Great heavens! on what does a woman's character and the honor of a whole family depend! I feel that I am nearly touched and wounded in the person of my poor sister. According to some people, M. de Trailles must have put his name to bills for a hundred thousand francs; nearly all of them are overdue, and proceedings are threatened. In this predicament, it seems that my sister sold her diamonds to a Jew—the beautiful diamonds that belonged to her husband's mother, Mme. de Restaud the elder—you have seen her wearing them. In fact, nothing else has been talked about for the last two days. So I can see that Anastasie is sure to come to Mme. de Beauséant's ball in tissue of gold, and ablaze with diamonds, to draw all eyes upon her; and I will not be outshone. She has tried to eclipse me all her life; she has never been kind to me, and I have helped her so often, and always had money for her when she had none. But never mind other people now; today I mean to be perfectly happy."

At one o'clock that morning Eugène was still with Mme. de Nucingen. In the midst of their lovers' farewell, a farewell full of hope of bliss to come, she said in a troubled voice, "I am very fearful, superstitious. Give what name you like to my presentiments, but I am afraid that my happiness will be paid for by some horrible catastrophe."

"Child!" said Eugène.

"Ah! have we changed places, and am I the child to-night?" she asked, laughingly.

Eugène went back to the Maison Vauquer, never doubting but that he should leave it for good on the morrow; and on the way he fell to dreaming the bright dreams of youth, when the cup of happiness has left its sweetness on the lips.

"Well?" cried Goriot, as Rastignac passed by his door.

"Yes," said Eugène; "I will tell you everything to-morrow."

"Everything, will you not?" cried the old man. "Go to bed. To-morrow our happy life will begin."

Next day, Goriot and Rastignac were ready to leave the lodging-house, and only awaited the good pleasure of a porter to move out of it; but towards noon there was a sound of wheels in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève, and a carriage stopped before the door of the Maison Vauquer. Mme. de Nucingen alighted, and asked if her father was still in the house, and, receiving an affirmative reply from Sylvie, ran lightly upstairs.

It so happened that Eugène was at home all unknown to his neighbor. At breakfast time he had asked Goriot to superintend the removal of his goods, saying that he would meet him in the Rue d'Artois at four o'clock; but Rastignac had answered the roll-call at the Law School, and he had gone back at once to the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève. No one had seen him come in, for Goriot had gone to find a porter, and the mistress of the house was likewise out. Eugène had thought to pay her himself, for it struck him that if he left this, Goriot in his zeal would probably pay for him. As it was, Eugène went up to his room to see that nothing had been forgotten, and blessed his foresight when he saw the blank bill bearing Vautrin's signature lying in the drawer where he had carelessly thrown it on the day when he had repaid the amount. There was no fire in the grate, so he was about to tear it into little pieces, when he heard a voice speaking in Goriot's room, and the speaker was Delphine! He made no more noise, and stood still to listen, thinking that she should have no secrets from him; but after the first few words, the conversation between the father and daughter was so strange and interesting that it absorbed all his attention.

"Ah! thank heaven that you thought of asking him to give an account of the money settled on me before I was utterly ruined, father. Is it safe to talk?" she added.

"Yes, there is no one in the house," said her father faintly.

"What is the matter with you?" asked Mme. de Nucingen.

"God forgive you! you have just dealt me a staggering blow, child!" said the old man. "You cannot know how much I love you, or you would not have burst in upon me like this, with such news, especially if all is not lost. Has something so important happened that you must come here about it? In a few minutes we should have been in the Rue d'Artois."

"Eh! does one think what one is doing after a catastrophe? It has turned my head. Your attorney has found out the state of things now, but it was bound to come out sooner or later. We shall want your long business experience; and I came to you like a drowning man who catches at a branch. When M. Derville found that Nucingen was throwing all sorts of difficulties in his way, he threatened him with proceedings, and told him plainly that he would soon obtain an order from the President of the Tribunal. So Nucingen came to my room this morning, and asked if I meant to ruin us both. I told him that I knew nothing whatever about it, that I had a fortune, and ought to be put into possession of my fortune, and that my attorney was acting for me in the matter; I said again that I knew absolutely nothing about it, and could not possibly go into the subject with him. Wasn't that what you told me to tell him?"

"Yes, quite right," answered Goriot.

"Well, then," Delphine continued, "he told me all about his affairs. He had just invested all his capital and mine in business speculations; they have only just been started, and very large sums of money are locked up. If I were to compel him to refund my dowry now, he would be forced to file his petition; but if I will wait a year, he undertakes, on his honor, to double or treble my fortune, by investing it in building land, and I shall be mistress at last of the whole of my property. He was speaking the truth, father dear; he frightened me! He asked my pardon for his conduct; he has given me my liberty; I am free to act as I please on condition that I leave him to carry on business in my name. To prove his sincerity, he promised that M. Derville might inspect the accounts as often as I pleased, so that I might be assured that everything was being conducted properly. In short, he put himself in my power, bound hand and foot. He wishes the present arrangements as to the expenses of housekeeping to continue for two more years, and entreated me not to exceed my allowance. He showed me plainly that it was all that he could do to keep up appearances; he has broken with his opera dancer; he will be compelled to practise the most strict economy (in secret) if he is to bide his time with unshaken credit. I scolded, I did all I could to drive him to desperation, so as to find out more. He showed me his ledgers—he broke down and cried at last. I never saw a man in such a state. He lost his head completely, talked of killing himself, and raved till I felt quite sorry for him."

"Do you really believe that silly rubbish?" cried her father. "It was all got up for your benefit! I have had to do with Germans in the way of business, honest and straightforward they are pretty sure to be, but when with their simplicity and frankness they are sharpers and humbugs as well, they are the worst rogues of all. Your husband is taking advantage of you. As soon as pressure is brought to bear on him he shams dead; he means to be more the master under your name than in his own. He will take advantage of the position to secure himself against the risks of business. He is as sharp as he is treacherous; he is a bad lot! No, no; I am not going to leave my girls behind me without a penny when I go to Père-Lachaise. I know something about business still. He has sunk his money in speculation, he says; very well then, there is something to show for it—bills, receipts, papers of some sort. Let him produce them, and come to an arrangement with you. We will choose the most promising of his speculations, take them over at our own risk, and have the securities transferred into your name; they shall represent the separate estate of Delphine Goriot, wife of the Baron de Nucingen. Does that fellow really take us for idiots? Does he imagine that I could stand the idea of your being without fortune, without bread, for forty-eight hours? I would not stand it a day—no, not a night, not a couple of hours! If there had been any foundation for the idea, I should never get over it. What! I have worked hard for forty years, carried sacks on my back, and sweated and pinched and saved all my life for you, my darlings, for you who made the toil and every burden borne for you seem light; and now, my fortune, my whole life, is to vanish in smoke! I should die raving mad if I believed a word of it. By all that's holiest in heaven and earth, we will have this cleared up at once; go through the books, have the whole business looked thoroughly into! I will not sleep, nor rest, nor eat until I have satisfied myself that all your fortune is in existence. Your money is settled upon you, God be thanked! and, luckily, your attorney, Maître Derville, is an honest man. Good Lord! you shall have your snug little million, your fifty thousand francs a year, as long as you live, or I will raise a racket in Paris, I will so! If the Tribunals put upon us, I will appeal to the Chambers. If I knew that you were well and comfortably off as far as money is concerned, that thought would keep me easy in spite of bad health and troubles. Money? Why, it is life! Money does everything. That great dolt of an Alsatian shall sing to another tune! Look here, Delphine, don't give way, don't make a concession of half a quarter of a farthing to that fathead, who has ground you down and made you miserable. Since he can't do without you, we shall hold the whip hand, and keep him in order. Great God! my brain is on fire; it is as if there were something red-hot inside my head. My Delphine lying on straw! You! my Fifine! Good gracious! Where are my gloves? Come, let us go at once; I mean to see everything with my own eyes—books, cash, and correspondence, the whole business. I shall have no peace until I know for certain that your fortune is secure."

"Oh! father dear, be careful how you set about it! If there is the least hint of vengeance in the business, if you show yourself openly hostile, it will be all over with me. He knows whom he has to deal with; he thinks it quite natural that if you put the idea into my head, I should be uneasy about my money; but I swear to you that he has it in his own hands, and that he had meant to keep it. He is just the man to abscond with all the money and leave us in the lurch, the scoundrel! He knows quite well that I will not dishonor the name I bear by bringing him into a court of law. His position is strong and weak at the same time. If we drive him to despair, I am lost."

"Why, then, the man is a rogue?"

"Well, yes, father," she said, flinging herself into a chair, "I wanted to keep it from you to spare your feelings," and she burst into tears; "I did not want you to know that you had married me to such a man as he is. He is just the same in private life—body and soul and conscience—the same through and through—hideous! I hate him; I despise him! Yes, after all that that despicable Nucingen has told me, I cannot respect him any longer. A man capable of mixing himself up in such affairs, and of talking about them to me as he did, without the slightest scruple—it is because I have read him through and through that I am afraid of him. He, my husband, frankly proposed to give me my liberty, and do you know what that means? If, supposing things turned out badly for him, I would play into his hands, and lend him my name."

"But there is law to be had! There is a Place de Grève for sons-in-law of that sort," cried her father; "why, I would guillotine him myself if there was no headsman to do it."

"No, father, the law cannot touch him. Listen, this is what he says, stripped of all his circumlocutions: 'Take your choice, you and no one else can be my accomplice; either everything is lost, you are ruined and have not a farthing, or you will let me carry this business through myself.' Is that plain speaking? He must have my assistance. He is assured that his wife will deal fairly by him; he knows that I shall leave his money to him and be content with my own. It is an unholy and dishonest compact, and he holds out threats of ruin to compel me to consent to it. He is buying my conscience, and the price is liberty to be Eugène's wife in all but name. 'I connive at your errors, and you allow me to commit crimes and ruin poor families!' Is that sufficiently explicit? Do you know what he means by speculations? He buys up land in his own name, then he finds men of straw to run up houses upon it. These men make a bargain with a contractor to build the houses, paying them by bills at long dates; then in consideration of a small sum they leave my husband in possession of the houses, and finally slip through the fingers of the deluded contractors by going into bankruptcy. The name of the firm of Nucingen has been used to dazzle the poor contractors. I saw that. I noticed, too, that Nucingen had sent bills for large amounts to Amsterdam, London, Naples, and Vienna, in order to prove if necessary that large sums had been paid away by the firm. How could we get possession of those bills?"

Eugène heard a dull thud on the floor; Old Goriot must have fallen on his knees.

"Great heavens! what have I done to you? Bound my daughter to this scoundrel who does as he likes with her! Oh! my child, my child! forgive me!" cried the old man.

"Yes, if I am in the depths of despair, perhaps you are to blame," said Delphine. "We have so little sense when we marry! What do we know of the world, of business, or men, or life? Our fathers should think for us! Father dear, I am not blaming you in the least, forgive me for what I said. This is all my own fault. Nay, do not cry, papa," she said, kissing him.

"Do not you cry either, my little Delphine. Look up and let me kiss away the tears. There! I shall find my wits and unravel this skein of your husband's winding."

"No, let me do that; I shall be able to manage him. He is fond of me, well and good; I shall use my influence to make him invest my money as soon as possible in landed property in my own name. Very likely I could get him to buy back Nucingen in Alsace in my name; that has always been a pet idea of his. Still, come to-morrow and go through the books, and look into the business. M. Derville knows little of mercantile matters. No, not to-morrow though. I do not want to be upset. Mme. de Beauséant's ball will be the day after to-morrow, and I must keep quiet, so as to look my best and freshest, and do honor to my dear Eugène!... Come, let us see his room."

But as she spoke a carriage stopped in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève, and the sound of Mme. de Restaud's voice came from the staircase. "Is my father in?" she asked of Sylvie.

This accident was luckily timed for Eugène, whose one idea had been to throw himself down on the bed and pretend to be asleep.

"Oh, father, have you heard about Anastasie?" said Delphine, when she heard her sister speak. "It looks as though some strange things had happened in that family."

"What sort of things?" asked Goriot. "This is like to be the death of me. My poor head will not stand a double misfortune."

"Good morning, father," said the Countess from the threshold. "Oh! Delphine, are you here?"

Mme. de Restaud seemed taken aback by her sister's presence.

"Good morning, Nasie," said the Baroness. "What is there so extraordinary in my being here? I see our father every day."

"Since when?"

"If you came yourself you would know."

"Don't tease, Delphine," said the Countess fretfully. "I am very miserable, I am lost. Oh! my poor father, it is hopeless this time!"

"What is it, Nasie?" cried Goriot. "Tell us all about it, child! How white she is! Quick, do something, Delphine; be kind to her, and I will love you even better, if that were possible."

"Poor Nasie!" said Mme. de Nucingen, drawing her sister to a chair. "We are the only two people in the world whose love is always sufficient to forgive you everything. Family affection is the surest, you see."

The Countess inhaled the salts offered her by her sister, and revived.

"This will kill me!" said their father. "There," he went on, stirring the smouldering fire, "come nearer, both of you. It is cold. What is it, Nasie? Be quick and tell me, this is enough to—"

"Well, then, my husband knows everything," said the Countess. "Just imagine it; do you remember, father, that bill of Maxime's some time ago? Well, that was not the first. I had paid ever so many before that. About the beginning of January M. de Trailles seemed very much troubled. He said nothing to me; but it is so easy to read the hearts of those you love, a mere trifle is enough; and then you feel things instinctively. Indeed, he was more tender and affectionate than ever, and I was happier than I had ever been before. Poor Maxime! in himself he was really saying good-bye to me, so he has told me since; he meant to blow his brains out! At last I worried him so, and begged and implored so hard; for two hours I knelt at his knees and prayed and entreated, and at last he told me—that he owed a hundred thousand francs. Oh! papa! a hundred thousand francs! I was beside myself! You had not the money, I knew; I had eaten up all that you had—"

"No," said Goriot; "I could not have got it for you unless I had stolen it. But I would have done that for you, Nasie! I will do it yet."

The words came from him like a sob, a hoarse sound like the death-rattle of a dying man; it seemed indeed like the agony of death when the father's love was powerless. There was a pause, and neither of the sisters spoke. It must have been selfishness indeed that could hear unmoved that cry of anguish that, like a pebble thrown over a precipice, revealed the depths of his despair.

"I found the money, father, by selling what was not mine to sell," and the Countess burst into tears.

Delphine was touched; she laid her head on her sister's shoulder, and cried too.

"Then it is all true," she said.

Anastasie bowed her head, Mme. de Nucingen flung her arms about her, kissed her tenderly, and held her sister to her heart.

"I shall always love you and never judge you, Nasie," she said.

"My angels," murmured Goriot faintly. "Oh, why should it be trouble that draws you together?"

This warm and palpitating affection seemed to give the Countess courage.

"To save Maxime's life," she said, "to save all my own happiness, I went to the money-lender you know of, a man of iron forged in hell-fire; nothing can melt him; I took all the family diamonds that M. de Restaud is so proud of—his and mine too—and sold them to that M. Gobseck. Sold them! Do you understand? I saved Maxime, but I am lost. Restaud found it all out."

"How? Who told him? I will kill him," cried Goriot.

"Yesterday he sent to tell me to come to his room. I went.... ‘Anastasie,' he said in a voice—oh! such a voice; that was enough, it told me everything—'where are your diamonds?'—‘In my room—'—‘No,' he said, looking straight at me, 'there they are on that chest of drawers—' And he lifted his handkerchief and showed me the casket. ‘Do you know where they came from?' he said. I fell at his feet.... I cried; I besought him to tell me the death he wished to see me die."

"You said that!" cried Goriot. "By God in heaven, whoever lays a hand on either of you so long as I am alive may reckon on being roasted by slow fires! Yes, I will cut him in pieces like..."

Goriot stopped; the words died away in his throat.

"And then, dear, he asked something worse than death of me. Oh! heaven preserve all other women from hearing such words as I heard then!"

"I will murder that man," said Goriot quietly. "But he has only one life, and he deserves to die twice. And then, what next?" he added, looking at Anastasie.

"Then," the Countess resumed, "there was a pause, and he looked at me. 'Anastasie,' he said, ‘I will bury this in silence; there shall be no separation; there are the children. I will not kill M. de Trailles. I might miss him if we fought, and as for other ways of getting rid of him, I should come into collision with the law. If I killed him in your arms, it would bring dishonor on those children. But if you do not want to see your children perish, nor their father nor me, you must first of all submit to two conditions. Answer me. Have I a child of my own?' I answered, 'Yes,'—'Which?'—‘Ernest, our eldest boy.'—'Very well,' he said, ‘and now swear to obey me in this particular from this time forward.' I swore. 'You will make over your property to me when I require you to do so.'"

"Do nothing of the kind!" cried Goriot. "Aha! M. de Restaud, you could not make your wife happy; she has looked for happiness and found it elsewhere, and you make her suffer for your own impotence? He will have to reckon with me. Make yourself easy, Nasie. Aha! he cares about his heir! Good, very good. I will get hold of the boy; isn't he my grandson? What the blazes! I can surely go to see the brat! I will stow him away somewhere. I will take care of him, you may be quite easy. I will bring Restaud to terms, the monster! I shall say to him, ‘A word or two with you! If you want your son back again, give my daughter her property, and leave her to do as she pleases.'"

"Father!"

"Yes. I am your father, Nasie, a father indeed! That rogue of a great lord had better not ill-treat my daughter. Tonnerre! What is it in my veins? There is the blood of a tiger in me; I could tear those two men to pieces! Oh! children, children! so this is what your lives are! Why, it is death!... What will become of you when I shall be here no longer? Fathers ought to live as long as their children. Ah! Lord God in heaven! how ill Thy world is ordered! Thou hast a Son, if what they tell us is true, and yet Thou leavest us to suffer so through our children. My darlings, my darlings! to think that trouble only should bring you to me, that I should only see you with tears on your faces! Ah! yes, yes, you love me, I see that you love me. Come to me and pour out your griefs to me; my heart is large enough to hold them all. Oh! you might rend my heart in pieces, and every fragment would make a father's heart. If only I could bear all your sorrows for you! ... Ah! you were so happy when you were little and still with me...."

"We have never been happy since," said Delphine. "Where are the old days when we slid down the sacks in the great granary?"

"That is not all, father," said Anastasie in Goriot's ear. The old man gave a startled shudder. "The diamonds only sold for a hundred thousand francs. Maxime is hard pressed. There are twelve thousand francs still to pay. He has given me his word that he will be steady and give up play in future. His love is all that I have left in the world. I have paid such a fearful price for it that I should die if I lose him now. I have sacrificed my fortune, my honor, my peace of mind, and my children for him. Oh! do something, so that at the least Maxime may be free and respected in the world, where he will assuredly make a career for himself. Something more than my happiness is at stake; the children have nothing, and if he is sent to Sainte-Pélagie all his prospects will be ruined."

"I haven't the money, Nasie. I have nothing—nothing left. This is the end of everything. Yes, the world is crumbling into ruin, I am sure. Fly! Save yourselves! Ah!—I have still my silver buckles left, and half a dozen silver spoons and forks, the first I ever had in my life. But I have nothing else except my life annuity, twelve hundred francs..."

"Then what has become of your money in the funds?"

"I sold out, and only kept a trifle for my wants. I wanted twelve thousand francs to furnish some rooms for Delphine."

"In your own house?" asked Mme. de Restaud, looking at her sister.

"What does it matter where they were?" asked Goriot. "The money is spent now."

"I see how it is," said the Countess. "Rooms for M. de Rastignac. Poor Delphine, take warning by me!"

"M. de Rastignac is incapable of ruining the woman he loves, dear."

"Thanks! Delphine. I thought you would have been kinder to me in my troubles, but you never did love me."

"Yes, yes, she loves you, Nasie," cried Goriot; "she was saying so only just now. We were talking about you, and she insisted that you were beautiful, and that she herself was only pretty!"

"Pretty!" said the Countess. "She is as hard as a marble statue."

"And if I am," cried Delphine, flushing up, "how have you treated me? You would not recognize me; you closed the doors of every house against me; you have never let an opportunity of mortifying me slip by. And when did I come, as you were always doing, to drain our poor father, a thousand francs at a time, till he is left as you see him now? That is all your doing, sister! I myself have seen my father as often as I could. I have not turned him out of the house, and then come and fawned upon him when I wanted money. I did not so much as know that he had spent those twelve thousand francs on me. I am economical, as you know; and when papa has made me presents, it has never been because I came and begged for them."

"You were better off than I. M. de Marsay was rich, as you have reason to know. You always were as slippery as gold. Good-bye; I have neither sister nor—"

"Oh! hush, hush, Nasie!" cried her father.

"Nobody else would repeat what everybody has ceased to believe. You are an unnatural sister!" cried Delphine.

"Oh, children, children! hush! hush! or I will kill myself before your eyes."

"There, Nasie, I forgive you," said Mme. de Nucingen; "you are very unhappy. But I am kinder than you are. How could you say that just when I was ready to do anything in the world to help you, even to be reconciled with my husband, which for my own sake I—Oh! it is just like you; you have behaved cruelly to me all through these nine years."

"Children, children, kiss each other!" cried the father. "You are angels, both of you."

"No. Let me alone," cried the Countess, shaking off the hand that her father had laid on her arm. "She has less pity for me than my husband. Any one might think she was a model of all the virtues herself!"

"I would rather have people think that I owed money to M. de Marsay than own that M. de Trailles had cost me more than two hundred thousand francs," retorted Mme. de Nucingen.

"Delphine!" cried the Countess, stepping towards her sister.

"I shall tell you the truth about yourself if you begin to slander me," said the Baroness coldly.

"Delphine! you are a—"

Old Goriot sprang between them, grasped the Countess' hand, and laid his own over her mouth.

"Good heavens, father! What have you been handling this morning?" said Anastasie.

"Ah! well, yes, I ought not to have touched you," said the poor father, wiping his hands on his trousers, "but I have been packing up my things; I did not know that you were coming to see me."

He was glad that he had drawn down her wrath upon himself. "Ah!" he sighed, as he sat down, "you children have broken my heart between you. This is killing me. My head feels as if it were on fire. Be good to each other and love each other! This will be the death of me! Delphine! Nasie! come, be sensible; you are both in the wrong. Come, Dedel," he added, looking through his tears at the Baroness, "she must have twelve thousand francs, you see; let us see if we can find them for her. Oh, my girls, do not look at each other like that!" And he sank on his knees beside Delphine. "Ask her to forgive you—just to please me," he said in her ear. "She is more miserable than you are. Come now, Dedel."

"Poor Nasie!" said Delphine, alarmed at the wild extravagant grief in her father's face, "I was in the wrong, kiss me—"

"Ah! that is like balm to my heart," cried Old Goriot. "But how are we to find twelve thousand francs? I might offer myself as a substitute in the army draft—"

"Oh! father dear!" they both cried, flinging their arms about him. "No, no!"

"God reward you for the thought. We are not worth it, are we, Nasie?" asked Delphine.

"And besides, father dear, it would only be a drop in the bucket," observed the Countess.

"But is flesh and blood worth nothing?" cried the old man in his despair. "I would give body and soul to save you, Nasie. I would do a murder for the man who would rescue you. I would do, as Vautrin did, go to the galleys, go—" he stopped as if struck by a thunderbolt, and put both hands to his head. "Nothing left!" he cried, tearing his hair. "If I only knew of a way to steal money, but it is so hard to do it, and then you can't set to work by yourself, and it takes time to rob a bank. Yes, it is time I was dead; there is nothing left me to do but to die. I am no good in the world; I am no longer a father! No. She has come to me in her extremity, and, wretch that I am, I have nothing to give her. Ah! you put your money into a life annuity, old scoundrel; and had you not daughters? You did not love them. Die, die in a ditch, like the dog that you are! Yes, I am worse than a dog; a beast would not have done as I have done! Oh! my head... it throbs as if it would burst."

"Papa!" cried both the young women at once, "do, pray, be reasonable!" and they clung to him to prevent him from dashing his head against the wall. There was a sound of sobbing.

Eugène, greatly alarmed, took the bill that bore Vautrin's signature, saw that the stamp would suffice for a larger sum, altered the figures, made it into a regular bill for twelve thousand francs, payable to Goriot's order, and went to his neighbor's room.

"Here is the money, madame," he said, handing the piece of paper to her. "I was asleep; your conversation awoke me, and by this means I learned all that I owed to M. Goriot. This bill can be discounted, and I shall meet it punctually at the due date."

The Countess stood motionless and speechless, but she held the bill in her fingers.

"Delphine," she said, with a white face, and her whole frame quivering with indignation, anger, and rage, "I forgave you everything; God is my witness that I forgave you, but I cannot forgive this! So this gentleman was there all the time, and you knew it! Your petty spite has led you to wreak your vengeance on me by betraying my secrets, my life, my children's lives, my shame, my honor! There, you are nothing to me any longer. I hate you. I will do all that I can to injure you. I will..."

Anger paralyzed her; the words died in her dry parched throat.

"Why, he is my son, my child; he is your brother, your preserver!" cried Goriot. "Kiss his hand, Nasie! Stay, I will embrace him myself," he said, straining Eugène to his breast in a frenzied clasp. "Oh my boy! I will be more than a father to you; I would be everything in the world to you; if I had God's power, I would fling worlds at your feet. Why don't you kiss him, Nasie? He is not a man, but an angel, a angel out of heaven."

"Never mind her, father; she is mad just now."

"Mad! am I? And what are you?" cried Mme. de Restaud.

"Children, children, I shall die if you go on like this," cried the old man, and he staggered and fell on the bed as if a bullet had struck him. "They are killing me between them," he said to himself.

The Countess fixed her eyes on Eugène, who stood stock-still; all his faculties were numbed by this violent scene.

"Sir?..." she said, doubt and inquiry in her face, tone, and bearing; she took no notice now of her father nor of Delphine, who was hastily unfastening his waistcoat.

"Madame," said Eugène, answering the question before it was asked, "I will meet the bill, and keep silence about it."

"You have killed our father, Nasie!" said Delphine, pointing to Goriot, who lay unconscious on the bed. The Countess fled.

"I forgive her," said the old man, opening his eyes; "her position is horrible; it would turn an older head than hers. Comfort Nasie, and be nice to her, Delphine; promise it to your poor father before he dies," he asked, holding Delphine's hand in a convulsive clasp.

"Oh! what ails you, father?" she cried in real alarm.

"Nothing, nothing," said Goriot; "it will go off. There is something heavy pressing on my forehead, a little headache.... Ah! poor Nasie, what a life lies before her!"

Just as he spoke, the Countess came back again and flung herself on her knees before him. "Forgive me!" she cried.

"Come," said her father, "you are hurting me still more."

"Monsieur," the Countess said, turning to Rastignac, "misery made me unjust to you. You will be a brother to me, will you not?" and she held out her hand. Her eyes were full of tears as she spoke.

"Nasie," cried Delphine, flinging her arms round her sister, "my little Nasie, let us forget and forgive."

"No, no," cried Nasie; "I shall never forget!"

"Dear angels," cried Goriot, "it is as if a dark curtain over my eyes had been raised; your voices have called me back to life. Kiss each other once more. Well, now, Nasie, that bill will save you, won't it?"

"I hope so. I say, papa, will you write your name on it?"

"There! how stupid of me to forget that! But I am not feeling at all well, Nasie, so you must not remember it against me. Send and let me know as soon as your trouble is over. No, I will go to you. No, after all, I will not go! I might meet your husband, and I should kill him on the spot. And as for signing away your property, I shall have a word to say about that. Quick, my child, and keep Maxime in order in future."

Eugène was too bewildered to speak.

"Poor Anastasie, she always had a violent temper," said Mme. de Nucingen, "but she has a good heart."

"She came back for the endorsement," said Eugène in Delphine's ear.

"Do you think so?"

"I only wish I could think otherwise. Do not trust her," he answered, raising his eyes as if he confided to Heaven the thoughts that he did not venture to express.

"Yes. She is always acting a part to some extent, and my poor father lets himself be taken in by it."

"How do you feel now, dear Old Goriot?" asked Rastignac.

"I should like to go to sleep," he replied.

Eugène helped him to bed, and Delphine sat by the bedside, holding his hand until he fell asleep. Then she went.

"This evening at the Italiens," she said to Eugène, "and you can let me know how he is. To-morrow you will leave this place, monsieur. Let us go into your room. Oh! how frightful!" she cried on the threshold. "Why, you are even worse lodged than our father, Eugène, you have behaved well. I would love you more if that were possible; but, dear boy, if you are to succeed in life, you must not begin by flinging twelve thousand francs out of the windows like that. The Comte de Trailles is a confirmed gambler. My sister shuts her eyes to it. He would have made the twelve thousand francs in the same way that he wins and loses heaps of gold."

A groan from the next room brought them back to Goriot's bedside; to all appearances he was asleep, but the two lovers caught the words, "They are not happy!" Whether he was awake or sleeping, the tone in which they were spoken went to his daughter's heart. She stole up to the pallet-bed on which her father lay, and kissed his forehead. He opened his eyes.

"Ah! Delphine!" he said.

"How are you now?" she asked.

"Quite comfortable. Do not worry about me; I shall get up presently. Don't stay with me, children; go, go and be happy."

Eugène went back with Delphine as far as her door; but he was not easy about Goriot, and would not stay to dinner, as she proposed. He wanted to be back at the Maison Vauquer. Old Goriot had left his room, and was just sitting down to dinner as he came in. Bianchon had placed himself where he could watch the old man carefully; and when the old vermicelli-maker took up his square of bread and smelled it to find out the quality of the flour, the medical student, studying him closely, saw that the action was purely mechanical, and shook his head.

"Just come and sit over here, you interne," said Eugène.

Bianchon went the more willingly because his change of place brought him next to the old lodger.

"What is wrong with him?" asked Rastignac.

"It is all up with him, or I am much mistaken! Something very extraordinary must have taken place; he looks to me as if he were in imminent danger of serous apoplexy. The lower part of his face is composed enough, but the upper part is drawn and distorted. Then there is that peculiar look about the eyes that indicates an effusion of serum in the brain; they look as though they were covered with a film of fine dust, do you notice? I shall know more about it by to-morrow morning."

"Is there any cure for it?"

"None. It might be possible to stave death off for a time if a way could be found of setting up a reaction in the lower extremities; but if the symptoms do not abate by to-morrow evening, it will be all over with him, poor old fellow! Do you know what has happened to bring this on? There must have been some violent shock, and his mind has given way."

"Yes, there was," said Rastignac, remembering how the two daughters had struck blow on blow at their father's heart.

"But Delphine at any rate loves her father," he said to himself.

That evening at the opera Rastignac chose his words carefully, lest he should give Mme. de Nucingen needless alarm.

"Do not be anxious about him," she said, however, as soon as Eugène began, "our father has really a strong constitution, but this morning we gave him a shock. Our whole fortunes were in peril, so the thing was serious, you see. I could not live if your affection did not make me insensible to troubles that I should once have thought too hard to bear. At this moment I have but one fear left, but one misery to dread—to lose the love that has made me feel glad to live. Everything else is as nothing to me compared with your love; I care for nothing else, for you are all the world to me. If I feel glad to be rich, it is for your sake. To my shame be it said, I think of my lover before my father. Do you ask why? I cannot tell you, but all my life is in you. My father gave me a heart, but you have taught it to beat. The whole world may condemn me; what does it matter if I stand acquitted in your eyes, for you have no right to think ill of me for the faults which a tyrannous love has forced me to commit for you! Do you think me an unnatural daughter? Oh! no, no one could help loving such a dear kind father as ours. But how could I hide the inevitable consequences of our miserable marriages from him? Why did he allow us to marry when we did? Was it not his duty to think for us and foresee for us? Today I know he suffers as much as we do, but how can it be helped? And as for comforting him, we could not comfort him in the least. Our resignation would give him more pain and hurt him far more than complaints and upbraidings. There are times in life when everything turns to bitterness."

Eugène was silent; the artless and sincere outpouring made an impression on him.

Parisian women are often false, intoxicated with vanity, selfish and self-absorbed, frivolous and shallow; yet of all women, when they love, they sacrifice their personal feelings to their passion; they rise but so much the higher for all the pettiness overcome in their nature, and become sublime. Then Eugène was struck by the profound discernment and insight displayed by this woman in judging of natural affection, when a privileged affection had separated and set her at a distance apart. Mme. de Nucingen was piqued by the silence,

"What are you thinking about?" she asked.

"I am thinking about what you said just now. Hitherto I have always felt sure that I cared far more for you than you did for me."

She smiled, and would not give way to the happiness she felt, lest their talk should exceed the conventional limits of propriety. She had never heard the vibrating tones of a sincere and youthful love; a few more words, and she feared for her self-control.

"Eugène," she said, changing the conversation, "I wonder whether you know what has been happening? All Paris will go to Mme. de Beauséant's to-morrow. The Rochefides and the Marquis d'Ajuda have agreed to keep the matter a profound secret, but to-morrow the king will sign the marriage contract, and your poor cousin the Vicomtesse knows nothing of it as yet. She cannot put off her ball, and the Marquis will not be there. People are wondering what will happen?"

"The world laughs at baseness and delights in it. But this will kill Mme. de Beauséant."

"Oh, no," said Delphine, smiling, "you do not know that kind of woman. Why, all Paris will be there, and so shall I. I owe that pleasure to you, however."

"Perhaps, after all, it is one of those absurd reports that people set in circulation here."

"We shall know the truth to-morrow."

Eugène did not return to the boarding-house. He could not forgo the pleasure of occupying his new rooms in the Rue d'Artois. Yesterday evening he had been obliged to leave Delphine soon after midnight, but that night it was Delphine who stayed with him until two o'clock in the morning. He rose late, and waited for Mme. de Nucingen, who came about noon to breakfast with him. Youth snatches eagerly at these rosy moments of happiness, and Eugène had almost forgotten Goriot's existence. The pretty things that surrounded him were growing familiar; this domestication in itself was a perpetual delight to him, and Mme. de Nucingen was there to glorify it all by her presence. It was four o'clock before they thought of Goriot, and of how he had looked forward to the new life in that house. Eugène said that the old man ought to be moved at once, lest he should grow too ill to move. He left Delphine, and hurried back to the lodging-house. Neither Old Goriot nor young Bianchon was in the dining-room with the others.

"Aha!" said the painter as Eugène came in, "Old Goriot has broken down at last. Bianchon is upstairs with him. One of his daughters—the Comtesse de Restaurama—came to see the old gentleman, and he would get up and go out, and made himself worse. Society is about to lose one of its brightest ornaments."

Rastignac sprang to the staircase.

"Hey! M. Eugène!"

"M. Eugène, the mistress is calling you," shouted Sylvie.

"It is this, sir," said the widow. "You and M. Goriot should by rights have moved out on the 15th of February. That was three days ago; today is the 18th, I ought really to be paid a month in advance; but if you will engage to pay for both, I shall be quite satisfied."

"Why, can't you trust him?"

"Trust him, indeed! If the old gentleman went off his head and died, those daughters of his would not pay me a farthing, and his things won't fetch ten francs. This morning he went out with all the spoons and forks he has left, I don't know why. He had got himself up to look quite young, and—Lord, forgive me—but I thought he had rouge on his cheeks; he looked quite young again."

"I will be responsible," said Eugène, shuddering with horror, for he foresaw the end.

He climbed the stairs and reached Old Goriot's room. The old man was tossing on his bed. Bianchon was with him.

"Good-evening, father," said Eugène.

The old man turned his glassy eyes on him, smiled gently, and said:

"How is she?"

"She is quite well. But how are you?"

"There is nothing much the matter."

"Don't tire him," said Bianchon, drawing Eugène into a corner of the room.

"Well?" asked Rastignac.

"Nothing but a miracle can save him now. Serous congestion has set in; I have put on mustard plasters, and luckily he can feel them, they are acting."

"Is it possible to move him?"

"Quite out of the question. He must stay where he is, and be kept as quiet as possible—"

"Dear Bianchon," said Eugène, "we will nurse him between us."

"I have had the head physician round from my hospital to see him."

"And what did he say?"

"He will give no opinion till to-morrow evening. He promised to look in again at the end of the day. Unluckily, the preposterous old man had to go and do something foolish this morning; he will not say what it was. He is as obstinate as a mule. As soon as I begin to talk to him he pretends not to hear, and lies as if he were asleep instead of answering, or if he opens his eyes he begins to groan. Some time this morning he went out on foot in the streets, nobody knows where he went, and he took everything that he had of any value with him. He has been driving some damned bargain, and it has been too much for his strength. One of his daughters has been here."

"Was it the Countess?" asked Eugène. "A tall, dark-haired woman, with large bright eyes, slender figure, and pretty ankles?"

"Yes."

"Leave him to me for a bit," said Rastignac. "I will make him confess; he will tell me all about it."

"And meanwhile I will get my dinner. But try not to excite him; there is still some hope left."

"All right."

"How they will enjoy themselves to-morrow," said Old Goriot when they were alone. "They are going to a grand ball."

"What were you doing this morning, papa, to make yourself so ill this evening that you have to stop in bed?"

"Nothing."

"Did not Anastasie come to see you?" demanded Rastignac.

"Yes," said Old Goriot.

"Well, then, don't keep anything from me. What more did she want of you?"

"Oh, she was very miserable," he answered, gathering up all his strength to speak. "It was this way, my boy. Since that affair of the diamonds, Nasie has not had a penny of her own. For this ball she had ordered a golden gown like a setting for a jewel. Her dressmaker, a woman without a conscience, would not give her credit, so Nasie's maid advanced a thousand francs on account. Poor Nasie! reduced to such shifts! It cut me to the heart to think of it! But when Nasie's maid saw how things were between her master and mistress, she was afraid of losing her money, and came to an understanding with the dressmaker, and the woman refuses to send the ball-dress until the money is paid. The gown is ready, and the ball is to-morrow night! Nasie was in despair. She wanted to borrow my forks and spoons to pawn them. Her husband is determined that she shall go and wear the diamonds, so as to contradict the stories that are told all over Paris. How can she go to that heartless scoundrel and say, ‘I owe a thousand francs to my dressmaker; pay her for me'? She cannot. I saw that myself. Delphine will be there too in a superb gown, and Anastasie ought not to be outdone by her younger sister. And then—she was drowned in tears, poor girl! I felt so humbled yesterday when I had not the twelve thousand francs, that I would have given the rest of my miserable life to wipe out that wrong. You see, I could have borne anything once, but latterly this want of money has broken my heart. Oh! I did not do it by halves; I did myself up a bit, and went out and sold my spoons and forks and buckles for six hundred francs; then I went to old Daddy Gobseck, and sold a year's interest in my annuity for four hundred francs down. Pshaw! I can live on dry bread, as I did when I was a young man; if I have done it before, I can do it again. My Nasie shall have one happy evening, at any rate. She shall be smart. The banknote for a thousand francs is here under my pillow; it warms me to have it lying there under my head, for it is going to make my poor Nasie happy. She can turn that bad girl Victoire out of the house. A servant that cannot trust her mistress, did any one ever hear the like! I shall be quite well to-morrow. Nasie is coming at ten o'clock. They must not think that I am ill, or they will not go to the ball; they will stop and take care of me. To-morrow Nasie will come and hold me in her arms as if I were one of her children; her kisses will make me well again. After all, I might have spent the thousand francs on physic; I would far rather give them to my little Nasie, who can charm all the pain away. At any rate, I am some comfort to her in her misery; and that makes up for my unkindness in buying an annuity. She is in the depths, and I cannot draw her out of them now. Oh! I will go into business again, I will buy wheat in Odessa; out there, wheat fetches a quarter of the price it sells for here. There is a law against the importation of grain, but the good folk who made the law forgot to prohibit the introduction of wheat products and foodstuffs made from corn. Hey! hey!... That struck me this morning. There is a fine trade to be done in starch."

Eugène, watching the old man's face, thought that his friend was light headed.

"Come," he said, "do not talk any more, you must rest—" Just then Bianchon came up, and Eugène went down to dinner.

The two students sat up with him that night, relieving each other in turn. Bianchon brought up his medical books and studied; Eugène wrote letters home to his mother and sisters. Next morning Bianchon thought the symptoms more hopeful, but the patient's condition demanded continual attention, which the two students alone were willing to give—a task impossible to describe in the reticent language of the present day. Leeches must be applied to the wasted body, the poultices and hot foot-baths, and other details of the treatment required the physical strength and devotion of the two young men. Mme. de Restaud did not come; but she sent a messenger for the money.

"I expected she would come herself; but it would have been a pity for her to come, she would have been anxious about me," said the father, and to all appearances he was well content.

At seven o'clock that evening Thérèse arrived with a letter from Delphine:


"What are you doing, dear friend? I have been loved for a very little while, and I am neglected already? In the confidences of heart and heart, I have learned to know your soul—you are too noble not to be faithful for ever, for you know that love with all its infinite subtle changes of feeling is never the same. Once you said, as we were listening to the Prayer from Moses in Egypt, "For some it is the monotony of a single note; for others, it is the infinite of sound." Remember that I am expecting you this evening to take me to Mme. de Beauséant's ball. Every one knows now that the King signed M. d'Ajuda's marriage contract this morning, and the poor Vicomtesse knew nothing of it until two o'clock this afternoon. All Paris will flock to her house, of course, just as a crowd fills the Place de Grève to see an execution. It is horrible, is it not, to go out of curiosity to see if she will hide her anguish, and whether she will die courageously? I certainly should not go, my friend, if I had been at her house before; but, of course, she will not receive society any more after this, and all my efforts would be in vain. My position is a very unusual one, and besides, I am going there partly on your account. I am waiting for you. If you are not with me in less than two hours, I do not know whether I could forgive such treason.



Rastignac took up a pen and wrote:


"I am waiting till the doctor comes to know if there is any hope of your father's life. He is dying. I will come and bring you the news, but I am afraid it may be a sentence of death. When I come you can decide whether you can go to the ball. Yours tenderly."



At half-past eight the doctor arrived. He did not take a very hopeful view of the case, but thought that there was no immediate danger. Improvements and relapses might be expected, and the good man's life and reason hung in the balance.

"It would be better for him to die at once," the doctor said as he took leave.

Eugène left Goriot to Bianchon's care, and went to carry the sad news to Mme. de Nucingen. Filial duby still lingered in his mind, and he thought this must put an end for the present to her plans of amusement.

"Tell her to enjoy her evening as if nothing had happened," cried Goriot. He had been lying in a sort of stupor, but he suddenly sat upright as Eugène went out.

Eugène, half heartbroken, entered Delphine's room. Her hair had been dressed; she wore her dancing slippers; she had only to put on her ball-dress; but when the artist is giving the finishing stroke to his creation, the last touches require more time than the whole groundwork of the picture.

"Why! you are not dressed!" she cried.

"Madame, your father—"

"My father again!" she exclaimed, breaking in upon him. "You need not teach me what is due to my father, I have known my father this long while. Not a word, Eugène. I will hear what you have to say when you are dressed. My carriage is waiting, take it, go round to your rooms and dress, Thérèse has put out everything in readiness for you. Come back as soon as you can; we will talk about my father on the way to Mme. de Beauséant's. We must go early; if we have to wait our turn in a row of carriages, we shall be lucky if we get there by eleven o'clock."

"Madame—"

"Quick! not a word!" she cried, darting into her dressing-room for a necklace.

"Do go, M. Eugène, or you will vex Madame," said Thérèse, hurrying him away; and Eugène was too horror-stricken by this elegant parricide to resist.

He went to his rooms and dressed, sad, thoughtful, and dispirited. The world of Paris was like an ocean of mud for him just then; and it seemed that whoever set foot in that black mire must needs sink into it up to the chin.

"Their crimes are paltry," said Eugène to himself. "Vautrin was greater."

He had seen society in its three great phases—Obedience, Struggle, and Revolt; the Family, the World, and Vautrin; and he hesitated in his choice. Obedience was dull, Revolt impossible, Struggle hazardous. His thoughts wandered back to the home circle. He thought of the quiet uneventful life, the pure happiness of the days spent among those who loved him there. Those loving and beloved beings passed their lives in obedience to the natural laws of the hearth, and in that obedience found a deep and constant serenity, unvexed by torments such as these. Yet, for all his good impulses, he could not bring himself to make profession of the religion of pure souls to Delphine, nor to prescribe the duties of piety to her in the name of love. His education had begun to bear its fruits; he loved selfishly already. Besides, his tact had discovered to him the real nature of Delphine; he divined instinctively that she was capable of stepping over her father's corpse to go to the ball; and within himself he felt that he had neither the strength of mind to play the part of mentor, nor the strength of character to vex her, nor the courage to leave her to go alone.

"She would never forgive me for putting her in the wrong over it," he said to himself. Then he turned the doctor's dictum over in his mind; he tried to believe that Goriot was not so dangerously ill as he had imagined, and ended by collecting together a sufficient quantity of traitorous excuses for Delphine's conduct. She did not know how ill her father was; the kind old man himself would have made her go to the ball if she had gone to see him. So often it happens that this one or that stands condemned by the social laws that govern family relations; and yet there are peculiar circumstances in the case, differences of temperament, divergent interests, innumerable complications of family life that excuse the apparent offence.

Eugène did not wish to see too clearly; he was ready to sacrifice his conscience to his mistress. Within the last few days his whole life had undergone a change. Woman had entered into his world and thrown it into chaos, family claims dwindled away before her; she had appropriated all his being to her uses. Rastignac and Delphine found each other at a crisis in their lives when their union gave them the most poignant bliss. Their passion, so long proved, had only gained in strength by the gratified desire that often extinguishes passion. This woman was his, and Eugène recognized that till then he had only desired her; he did not love her till he had gained his happiness perhaps love is only gratitude for pleasure. This woman, vile or sublime, he adored for the pleasures she had brought as her dower; and Delphine loved Rastignac as Tantalus would have loved some angel who had satisfied his hunger and quenched the burning thirst in his parched throat.

"Well," said Mme. de Nucingen when he came back in evening dress, "how is my father?"

"Very dangerously ill," he answered; "if you will grant me a proof of your affections, we will just go in to see him on the way."

"Very well," she said. "Yes, but afterwards. Dear Eugène, do be nice, and don't preach to me. Come."

They set out. Eugène said nothing for a while.

"What is it now?" she asked.

"I can hear the death-rattle in your father's throat," he said, almost angrily. And with the hot indignation of youth, he told the story of Mme. de Restaud's vanity and cruelty, of her father's final act of self-sacrifice, that had brought about this struggle between life and death, of the price that had been paid for Anastasie's golden embroideries. Delphine cried.

"I shall look frightful," she thought. She dried her tears.

"I will nurse my father; I will not leave his bedside," she said aloud.

"Ah! now you are as I would have you," exclaimed Rastignac.

The lamps of five hundred carriages lit up the darkness about the Hôtel de Beauséant. A gendarme in all the glory of his uniform stood on either side of the brightly lighted gateway. The great world was flocking thither that night in its eager curiosity to see the great lady at the moment of her fall, and the rooms on the ground floor were already full to overflowing, when Mme. de Nucingen and Rastignac appeared. Never since Louis XIV tore her lover away from Mlle. de Montpensier, and the whole court hastened to visit that unfortunate princess, had a disastrous love affair made such a sensation in Paris. But the youngest daughter of the almost royal house of Burgundy had risen proudly above her pain, and moved till the last moment like a queen in this world—its vanities had always been valueless for her, save in so far as they contributed to the triumph of her passion. The salons were filled with the most beautiful women in Paris, resplendent in their gowns, and radiant with smiles. Ministers and ambassadors, the most distinguished men at court, men bedecked with crosses, stars, and ribbons, men who bore the most illustrious names in France, had gathered about the Vicomtesse.

The music of the orchestra vibrated in wave after wave of sound from the golden ceiling of the palace, now made desolate for its queen.

Mme. de Beauséant stood at the door of the first salon to receive the guests who were styled her friends. She was dressed in white, and wore no ornament in the plaits of hair braided about her head; her face was calm; there was no sign there of pride, nor of pain, nor of joy that she did not feel. No one could read her soul; she stood there like some Niobe carved in marble. For a few intimate friends there was a tinge of satire in her smile; but no scrutiny saw any change in her, nor had she looked otherwise in the days of the glory of her happiness. The most callous of her guests admired her as young Rome applauded some gladiator who could die smiling. It seemed as if society had adorned itself for a last audience of one of its sovereigns.

"I was afraid that you would not come," she said to Rastignac.

"Madame," he said, in an unsteady voice, taking her speech as a reproach, "I shall be the last to go, that is why I am here."

"Good," she said, and she took his hand. "You are perhaps the only one I can trust here among all these. Oh, my friend, when you love, love a woman whom you are sure that you can love always. Never forsake a woman."

She took Rastignac's arm, and went towards a sofa in the cardroom.

"I want you to go to the Marquis," she said. "Jacques, my footman, will go with you; he has a letter that you will take. I am asking the Marquis to give my letters back to me. He will give them all up, I like to think that. When you have my letters, go up to my room with them. Someone shall bring me word."

She rose to go to meet the Duchesse de Langeais, her most intimate friend, who had just arrived.

Rastignac went. He asked for the Marquis d'Ajuda at the Hôtel Rochefide, feeling certain that the latter would be spending his evening there, and so it proved. The Marquis went to his own house with Rastignac, and gave a casket to the student, saying as he did so, "They are all there."

He seemed as if he was about to say something to Eugène, to ask about the ball, or the Vicomtesse; perhaps he was on the brink of the confession that, even then, he was in despair, and knew that his marriage had been a fatal mistake; but a proud gleam shone in his eyes, and with deplorable courage he kept his noblest feelings a secret.

"Do not even mention my name to her, my dear Eugène." He grasped Rastignac's hand sadly and affectionately, and turned away from him. Eugène went back to the Hôtel Beauséant, the servant took him to the Vicomtesse's room. There were signs there of preparations for a journey. He sat down by the fire, fixed his eyes on the cedar-wood casket, and fell into deep mournful musings. Mme. de Beauséant loomed large in these imaginings, like a goddess in the Iliad.

"Ah! my friend!..." said the Vicomtesse; she crossed the room and laid her hand on Rastignac's shoulder. He saw the tears in his cousin's uplifted eyes, saw that one hand was raised to take the casket, and that the fingers of the other trembled. Suddenly she took the casket, put it in the fire, and watched it burn.

"They are dancing," she said. "They all came very early; but death will be long in coming. Hush! my friend"—and she laid a finger on Rastignac's lips, seeing that he was about to speak—"I shall never see Paris again. I am taking my leave of the world. At five o'clock this morning I shall set out on my journey; I mean to bury myself in the remotest part of Normandy. I have had very little time to make my arrangements; since three o'clock this afternoon I have been busy signing documents, setting my affairs in order; there was no one whom I could send to..."

She broke off.

"He was sure to be..."

Again she broke off; the weight of her sorrow was more than she could bear. In such moments as these everything is agony, and some words are impossible to utter.

"And so I counted upon you to do me this last piece of service this evening," she said. "I should like to give you some pledge of friendship. I shall often think of you. You have seemed to me to be kind and noble, fresh-hearted and true, in this world where such qualities are seldom found. I should like you to think sometimes of me. Stay," she said, glancing about her, "there is this box that has held my gloves. Every time I opened it before going to a ball or to the theatre, I used to feel that I must be beautiful, because I was so happy; and I never touched it except to lay some gracious memory in it: there is so much of my old self in it, of a Mme. de Beauséant who now lives no longer. Will you take it? I will leave directions that it is to be sent to you in the Rue d'Artois. Mme. de Nucingen looked very charming this evening. Eugène, you must love her. Perhaps we may never see each other again, my friend; but be sure of this, that I shall pray for you who have been kind to me. Now let us go downstairs. People shall not think that I am weeping. I have all time and eternity before me, and where I am going I shall be alone, and no one will ask me the reason of my tears. One last look round first."

She stood for a moment. Then she covered her eyes with her hands for an instant, dashed away the tears, bathed her face with cold water, and took the student's arm.

"Let us go!" she said.

This suffering, endured with such noble fortitude, shook Eugène with a more violent emotion than he had felt before. They went back to the ballroom, and Mme. de Beauséant went through the rooms on Eugène's arm—the last delicately gracious act of a gracious woman. In another moment he saw the sisters, Mme. de Restaud and Mme. de Nucingen. The Countess shone in all the glory of her magnificent diamonds; every stone must have scorched like fire, she was never to wear them again. Strong as love and pride might be in her, she found it difficult to meet her husband's eyes. The sight of her was scarcely calculated to lighten Rastignac's sad thoughts; through the blaze of those diamonds he seemed to see the wretched pallet-bed on which Old Goriot was lying. The Vicomtesse misread his melancholy; she withdrew her hand from his arm.

"Come," she said, "I must not deprive you of a pleasure."

Eugène was soon claimed by Delphine. She was delighted with the impression that she had made, and eager to lay at her lover's feet the homage she had received in this new world in which she hoped to live and move henceforth.

"What do you think of Nasie?" she asked him.

"She has turned everything to money, even her own father's death," said Rastignac.

Towards four o'clock in the morning the rooms began to empty. A little later the music ceased, and the Duchesse de Langeais and Rastignac were left in the great ballroom. The Vicomtesse, who thought to find the student there alone, came back there at the last. She had taken leave of M. de Beauséant, who had gone off to bed, saying again as he went, "It is a great pity, my dear, to shut yourself up at your age! Pray stay among us."

Mme. de Beauséant saw the Duchesse, and, in spite of herself, an exclamation broke from her.

"I saw how it was, Clara," said Mme. de Langeais. "You are going from among us, and you will never come back. But you must not go until you have heard me, until we have understood each other."

She took her friend's arm, and they went together into the next room. There the Duchess looked at her with tears in her eyes; she held her friend in a close embrace, and kissed her cheek.

"I could not let you go without a word, dearest; the remorse would have been too hard to bear. You can count upon me as surely as upon yourself. You have shown yourself great this evening; I feel that I am worthy of our friendship, and I mean to prove myself worthy of it. I have not always been kind; I was in the wrong; forgive me, dearest; I wish I could unsay anything that may have hurt you; I take back those words. One common sorrow has brought us together again, for I do not know which of us is the more miserable. M. de Montriveau was not here to-night; do you understand what that means? None of those who saw you to-night, Clara, will ever forget you. I mean to make one last effort. If I fail, I shall go into a convent. Clara, where are you going?"

"Into Normandy, to Courcelles. I shall love and pray there until the day when God shall take me from this world. M. de Rastignac!" called the Vicomtesse, in a tremulous voice, remembering that the young man was waiting there.

The student knelt to kiss his cousin's hand.

"Good-bye, Antoinette!" said Mme. de Beauséant. "May you be happy." She turned to the student. "You are young," she said; "you have some beliefs still left. I have been privileged, like some dying people, to find sincere and reverent feeling in those about me as I take my leave of this world."

It was nearly five o'clock that morning when Rastignac came away. He had put Mme. de Beauséant into her traveling carriage, and received her last farewells, spoken amid fast-falling tears; for no greatness is so great that it can rise above the laws of human affection, or live beyond the jurisdiction of pain, as certain demagogues would have the people believe. Eugène returned on foot to the Maison Vauquer through the cold and darkness. His education was nearly complete.

"There is no hope for poor Old Goriot," said Bianchon, as Rastignac came into the room. Eugène looked for a while at the sleeping man, then he turned to his friend. "Dear fellow, you are content with the modest career you have marked out for yourself; keep to it. I am in hell, and I must stay there. Believe everything that you hear said of the world, nothing is too impossibly bad. No Juvenal could paint the horrors hidden away under the covering of gems and gold."

At two o'clock in the afternoon Bianchon came to wake Rastignac, and begged him to take charge of Goriot, who had grown worse as the day wore on. The medical student was obliged to go out.

"Poor old man, he has not two days to live, maybe not many hours," he said; "but we must do our utmost, all the same, to fight the disease. It will be a very troublesome case, and we shall want money. We can nurse him between us, of course, but, for my own part, I have not a penny. I have turned out his pockets, and rummaged through his drawers—result, zero. I asked him about it while his mind was clear, and he told me he had not a farthing of his own. What have you?"

"I have twenty francs left," said Rastignac; "but I will take them to the roulette table, I shall be sure to win."

"And if you lose?"

"Then I shall go to his sons-in-law and his daughters and ask them for money."

"And suppose they refuse?" Bianchon retorted. "The most pressing thing just now is not really money; we must put mustard poultices, as hot as they can be made, on his feet and legs. If he calls out, there is still some hope for him. You know how to do it, and besides, Christophe will help you. I am going round to the dispensary to persuade them to let us have the things we want on credit. It is a pity that we could not move him to the hospital; poor fellow, he would be better there. Well, come along, I leave you in charge; you must stay with him till I come back."

The two young men went back to the room where the old man was lying. Eugène was startled at the change in Goriot's face, so livid, distorted, and feeble.

"How are you, papa?" he said, bending over the pallet-bed. Goriot turned his dull eyes upon Eugène, looked at him attentively, and did not recognize him. It was more than the student could bear; the tears came into his eyes.

"Bianchon, ought we to have the curtains put up in the windows?"

"No, the temperature and the light do not affect him now. It would be a good thing for him if he felt heat or cold; but we must have a fire in any case to make sleeping draughts and heat the other things. I will send round a few sticks; they will last till we can have in some firewood. I burned all the briquettes you had left, as well as his, poor man, yesterday and during the night. The place was so damp that the water stood in drops on the walls; I could hardly get the room dry. Christophe came in and swept the floor, but the place is like a stable; I had to burn juniper, the smell was something horrible.

"My God!" said Rastignac. "To think of those daughters of his."

"One moment, if he asks for something to drink, give him this," said the house student, pointing to a large white jar. "If he begins to groan, and the belly feels hot and hard to the touch, you know what to do; get Christophe to help you. If he should happen to grow much excited, and begin to talk a good deal, and even to ramble in his talk, do not be alarmed. It would not be a bad symptom. But send Christophe to the Cochin Hospice. Our doctor, my friend, or I will come and apply moxas. We had a great consultation this morning while you were asleep. A surgeon, a pupil of Gall's, came, and our House surgeon, and the head physician from the Hôtel-Dieu. Those gentlemen considered that the symptoms were very unusual and interesting; the case must be carefully watched, for it throws a light on several obscure and rather important scientific problems. One of the authorities says that if there is more pressure of serum on one or other portion of the brain, it should affect his mental capacities in such and such directions. So if he should talk, notice very carefully what kind of ideas his mind seems to run on; whether memory, or penetration, or the reasoning faculties are exercised; whether sentiments or practical questions fill his thoughts; whether he makes forecasts or dwells on the past; in fact, you must be prepared to give an accurate report of him. It is quite likely that the extravasation fills the whole brain, in which case he will die in the imbecile state in which he is lying now. You cannot tell anything about these mysterious nervous diseases. Suppose the crash came here," said Bianchon, touching the back of the head, "very strange things have been known to happen; the brain sometimes partially recovers, and death is delayed. Or the congested matter may pass out of the brain altogether through channels which can only be determined by a post-mortem examination. There is an old man at the Hospital for Incurables, an imbecile patient, in his case the effusion has followed the direction of the spinal cord; he suffers horrid agonies, but he lives."

"Did they enjoy themselves?" It was Old Goriot who spoke. He had recognized Eugène.

"Oh! he thinks of nothing but his daughters," said Bianchon. "Scores of times last night he said to me, 'They are dancing now! She has her dress.' He called them by their names. He made me cry, the devil take it, calling with that tone in his voice, for 'Delphine! my little Delphine! and Nasie!' Upon my word," said the medical student, "it was enough to make any one burst into tears."

"Delphine," said the old man, "she is there, isn't she? I knew she was there," and his eyes sought the door.

"I am going down now to tell Sylvie to get the poultices ready," said Bianchon. "They ought to go on at once."

Rastignac was left alone with the old man. He sat at the foot of the bed, and gazed at the face before him, so horribly changed that it was shocking to see.

"Noble natures cannot dwell in this world," he said; "Mme. de Beauséant has fled from it, and there he lies dying. What place indeed is there in the shallow petty frivolous thing called society for noble thoughts and feelings?"

Pictures of yesterday's ball rose up in his memory, in strange contrast to the death-bed before him. Bianchon suddenly appeared.

"I say, Eugène, I have just seen our head surgeon at the hospital, and I ran all the way back here. If the old man shows any signs of reason, if he begins to talk, cover him with a mustard poultice from the neck to the base of the spine, and send round for us."

"Dear Bianchon," exclaimed Eugène.

"Oh! it is an interesting case from a scientific point of view," said the medical student, with all the enthusiasm of a neophyte.

"So!" said Eugène. "Am I really the only one who cares for the poor old man for his own sake?"

"You would not have said so if you had seen me this morning," returned Bianchon, who did not take offence at this speech. "Doctors who have seen a good deal of practice never think of anything but the cases, but, my dear fellow, I can see the patient still."

He went out. Eugène was left alone with the old man, and with an apprehension of a crisis that set in, in fact, before very long.

"Ah! dear boy, is that you?" said Old Goriot, recognizing Eugène.

"Do you feel better?" asked the law student, taking his hand.

"Yes. My head felt as if it were being screwed in a vise, but now it is set free again. Did you see my girls? They will be here directly; as soon as they know that I am ill they will hurry here at once; they used to take such care of me in the Rue de la Jussienne! Great Heavens! if only my room was fit for them to come into! There has been a young man here, who has burned up all my briquettes."

"I can hear Christophe coming upstairs," Eugène answered. "He is bringing up some firewood that that young man has sent you."

"Good, but how am I to pay for the wood? I have not a penny left, dear boy. I have given everything, everything. I am a pauper now. Well, at least the golden gown was grand, was it not? (Oh! I am in such pain!) Thanks, Christophe! God will reward you, my boy; I have nothing left now."

Eugène went over to Christophe and whispered in the man's ear, "I will pay you well, and Sylvie too, for your trouble."

"My daughters told you that they were coming, didn't they, Christophe? Go again to them, and I will give you five francs. Tell them that I am not feeling well, that I should like to kiss them both and see them once again before I die. Tell them that, but don't alarm them more than you can help."

Rastignac signed to Christophe to go.

"They will come before long," the old man went on. "I know them so well. My tender-hearted Delphine! If I am going to die, she will feel it so much! And so will Nasie. I do not want to die; they will cry if I die; and if I die, dear Eugène, I shall not see them any more. It will be very dreary there where I am going. For a father it is hell to be without your children; I have served my apprenticeship already since they married. My heaven was in the Rue de la Jussienne. Eugène, do you think that if I go to heaven I could come back to earth, and be near them in spirit? I have heard some such things said. It is true? It is as if I could see them at this moment as they used to be when we all lived in the Rue de la Jussienne. They used to come downstairs of a morning. ‘Good morning, papa!' they used to say, and I would take them on my knees; we had all sorts of little games of play together, and they had such pretty coaxing ways. We always had breakfast together, too, every morning, and they had dinner with me—in fact, I was a father then. I enjoyed my children. They did not think for themselves so long as they lived in the Rue de la Jussienne; they knew nothing of the world; they loved me with all their hearts. Oh, God! why could they not always be little girls? (Oh! my head! this racking pain in my head!) Ah! ah! forgive me, children, this pain is fearful; it must be agony indeed, for you have used me to endure pain. Oh, God! if only I held their hands in mine, I should not feel it at all. Do you think that they are on the way? Christophe is so stupid; I ought to have gone myself. He will see them. But you went to the ball yesterday; just tell me how they looked. They did not know that I was ill, did they, or they would not have been dancing, poor little things? Oh! I must not be ill any longer. They stand too much in need of me; their fortunes are in danger. And such husbands as they are bound to! I must get well! (Oh! what pain this is! what pain this is!... ah! ah!) I must get well, you see; for they must have money, and I know how to set about making some. I will go to Odessa and manufacture starch there. I am an old hand, I will make millions. (Oh! this is agony!)"

Goriot was silent for a moment; it seemed to require his whole strength to endure the pain.

"If they were here, I should not complain," he said. "So why should I complain now?"

He seemed to grow drowsy with exhaustion, and lay quietly for a long time. Christophe came back; and Rastignac, thinking that Goriot was asleep, allowed the man to give his story aloud.

"First of all, sir, I went to Madame la Comtesse," he said; "but she and her husband were so busy that I couldn't get to speak to her. When I insisted that I must see her, M. de Restaud came out to me himself, and went on like this: ‘M. Goriot is dying, is he? Very well, it is the best thing he can do. I want Mme. de Restaud to transact some important business; when it is all finished she can go.' The gentleman looked angry, I thought. I was just going away when Mme. de Restaud came out into an ante-chamber through a door that I did not notice, and said, 'Christophe, tell my father that my husband wants me to discuss some matters with him, and I cannot leave the house, the life or death of my children is at stake; but as soon as it is over, I will come.' As for Madame la Baronne, that is another story! I could not speak to her either, and I did not even see her. Her maid said, ‘Ah yes, but Madame only came back from a ball at a quarter to five this morning; she is asleep now, and if I wake her before midday she will be cross. As soon as she rings, I will go and tell her that her father is worse. It will be time enough then to tell her bad news!' I begged and prayed, but, there! it was no good. Then I asked to see the baron, but he was out."

"To think that neither of his daughters should come!" exclaimed Rastignac. "I will write to them both."

"Neither of them!" cried the old man, sitting upright in bed. "They are busy, they are asleep, they will not come! I knew that they would not. Not until you are dying do you know your children.... Oh! my friend, do not marry; do not have children! You give them life; they give you your death-blow. You bring them into the world, and they send you out of it. No, they will not come. I have known that these ten years. Sometimes I have told myself so, but I did not dare to believe it."

The tears gathered and stood without overflowing the red sockets.

"Ah! if I were rich still, if I had kept my money, if I had not given all to them, they would be with me now; they would fawn on me and cover my cheeks with their kisses! I should be living in a great mansion; I should have grand apartments and servants and a fire in my room; and they would be about me all in tears and their husbands and their children. I should have had all that; now—I have nothing. Money brings everything to you; even your daughters. My money. Oh! where is my money? If I had plenty of money to leave behind me, they would nurse me and tend me; I should hear their voices, I should see their faces. Ah! My dear child, My only child ,I would rather have my loneliness and misery! When one is loved in the midst of one's misery, at least one is sure the love is real. No, I would like to be rich, then I should see them. Ah, God! who knows? They both of them have hearts of stone. I loved them too much; it was not likely that they should love me. A father ought always to be rich; he ought to keep his children well in hand, like unruly horses. I have gone down on my knees to them. Wretches! this is the crowning act that brings the last ten years to a proper close. If you but knew how much they made of me just after they were married. (Oh! this is cruel torture!) I had just given them each eight hundred thousand francs; they were bound to be civil to me after that, and their husbands too were civil. I used to go to their houses: it was ‘My kind father' here, ‘My dear father' there. There was always a place for me at their tables. I used to dine with their husbands now and then, and they were very respectful to me. I was still worth something, they thought. How should they know? I had not said anything about my affairs. It is worth while to be civil to a man who has given his daughters eight hundred thousand francs apiece; and they showed me every attention then—but it was all for my money. The world is an ugly place. I found that out by experience! I went to the theatre with them in their carriage; I might stay as long as I cared to stay at their evening parties. In fact, they acknowledged me their father; publicly they owned that they were my daughters. But I was always a shrewd one, you see, and nothing was lost upon me. Everything went straight to the mark and pierced my heart. I saw quite well that it was all sham and pretence, but there is no help for such things as these. I felt less at my ease at their dinner table than I did downstairs here. I had nothing to say for myself. So these grand folks would ask in my son-in-law's ear, ‘Who may that gentleman be?'—‘The father-in-law with the dollars; he is very rich.'—‘The devil, he is!' they would say, and look again at me with the respect due to my money. Well, if I was in the way sometimes, I paid dearly for my mistakes. And besides, who is perfect? (My head is tortured!) Dear M. Eugène, I am suffering so now, that a man might die of the pain; but it is nothing to be compared with the pain I endured when Anastasie made me feel, for the first time, that I had said something stupid. She looked at me, and that glance of hers opened all my veins. I used to want to know everything, to be learned; and one thing I did learn thoroughly—I knew that I was not wanted here on earth.

"The next day I went to Delphine for comfort, and what should I do there but make some stupid blunder that made her angry with me. I was like one driven out of his senses. For a week I did not know what to do; I did not dare to go to see them for fear they should reproach me. And that was how they both turned me out of the house.

"Oh God! Thou knowest all the misery and anguish that I have endured; Thou hast counted all the wounds that have been dealt to me in these years that have aged and changed me and whitened my hair and drained my life; why dost Thou make me to suffer so today? Have I not more than expiated the sin of loving them too much? They themselves have been the instruments of vengeance; they have tortured me for my sin of affection.

"Ah, well! fathers know no better; I loved them so; I went back to them as a gambler goes to the gaming table. This love was my vice, you see, my mistress—they were everything in the world to me. They were always wanting something or other, dresses and ornaments, and what not; their maids used to tell me what they wanted, and I used to give them the things for the sake of the welcome that they bought for me. But, at the same time, they used to give me little lectures on my behavior in society; they began about it at once. Then they began to feel ashamed of me. That is what comes of having your children well brought up. I could not go to school again at my time of life. (This pain is fearful! Oh God! These doctors! these doctors! If they would open my head, it would give me some relief!) Oh, my daughters, my daughters! Anastasie! Delphine! If I could only see them! Send for the police, and make them come to me! Justice is on my side, the whole world is on my side, I have natural rights, and the law with me. I protest! The country will go to ruin if a father's rights are trampled underfoot. That is easy to see. The whole world turns on fatherly love; fatherly love is the foundation of society; it will crumble into ruin when children do not love their fathers. Oh! if I could only see them, and hear them, no matter what they said; if I could simply hear their voices, it would soothe the pain. Delphine! Delphine most of all. But tell them when they come not to look so coldly at me as they do. Oh! my friend, my good M. Eugène, you do not know that it is when all the golden light in a glance suddenly turns to a leaden gray. It has been one long winter here since the light in their eyes shone no more for me. I have had nothing but disappointments to devour. Disappointment has been my daily bread; I have lived on humiliation and insults. I have swallowed down all the affronts for which they sold me my poor stealthy little moments of joy; for I love them so! Think of it! a father hiding himself to get a glimpse of his children! I have given all my life to them, and today they will not give me one hour! I am hungering and thirsting for them, my heart is burning in me, but they will not come to bring relief in the agony, for I am dying now, I feel that this is death. Do they not know what it means to trample on a father's corpse? There is a God in heaven who avenges us fathers whether we will or no.

"Oh! they will come! Come to me, darlings, and give me one more kiss; one last kiss, the viaticum for your father, who will pray God for you in heaven. I will tell Him that you have been good children to your father, and plead your cause with God! After all it is not their fault. I tell you they are innocent, my friend. Tell every one that it is not their fault, and no one need be distressed on my account. It is all my own fault, I taught them to trample upon me. I loved to have it so. It is no one's affair but mine; man's justice and God's justice have nothing to do in it. God would be unjust if He condemned them for anything they may have done to me. I did not behave to them properly; I was stupid enough to resign my rights. I would have humbled myself in the dust for them. What could you expect? The most beautiful nature, the noblest soul, would have been spoiled by such indulgence. I am a wretch, I am justly punished. I, and I only, am to blame for all their sins; I spoiled them. Today they are as eager for pleasure as they used to be for sugar-plums. When they were little girls I indulged them in every whim. They had a carriage of their own when they were fifteen. They have never been crossed. I am guilty, and not they—but I sinned through love.

"My heart would open at the sound of their voices. I can hear them; they are coming. Yes! yes! they are coming. The law demands that they should be present at their father's death-bed; the law is on my side. It would only cost them the hire of a cab. I would pay that. Write to them, tell them that I have millions to leave to them! On my word of honor, yes. I am going to manufacture macaroni at Odessa. I understand the trade. There are millions to be made in it. Nobody has thought of the scheme as yet. You see, there will be no waste, no damage in transit, as there always is with wheat and flour. Hey! hey! and starch too; there are millions to be made in the starch trade! You will not be telling a lie. Millions, tell them; and even if they really come because they covet the money, I would rather let them deceive me; and I shall see them in any case. I want my children! I gave them life; they are mine, mine!" and he sat upright. The head thus raised, with its scanty white hair, seemed to Eugène like a threat; every line that could still speak spoke of menace.

"There, there, dear father," said Eugène, "lie down again; I will write to them at once. As soon as Bianchon comes back I will go for them myself, if they do not come before."

"If they do not come?" repeated the old man, sobbing. "Why, I shall be dead before then; I shall die in a fit of rage, of rage! Anger is getting the better of me. I can see my whole life at this minute. I have been cheated! They do not love me—they have never loved me all their lives! It is all clear to me. They have not come, and they will not come. The longer they put off their coming, the less they are likely to give me this joy. I know them. They have never cared to guess my disappointments, my sorrows, my wants; they never cared to know my life; they will have no presentiment of my death; they do not even know the secret of my tenderness for them. Yes, I see it all now. I have laid my heart open so often, that they take everything I do for them as a matter of course. They might have asked me for the very eyes out of my head, and I would have bidden them to pluck them out. They think that all fathers are like theirs. You should always make your value felt. Their own children will avenge me. Why, for their own sakes they should come to me! Make them understand that they are laying up retribution for their own death-beds. All crimes are summed up in this one.... Go to them; just tell them that if they stay away it will be parricide! There is enough laid to their charge already without adding that to the list. Cry aloud as I do now, ‘Nasie! Delphine! here! Come to your father; the father who has been so kind to you is lying ill!' Not a sound; no one comes! Then am I to die like a dog? This is to be my reward—I am forsaken at the last. They are wicked, heartless women; curses on them, I loathe them. I shall rise at night from my grave to curse them again; for, after all, my friends, have I done wrong? They are behaving very badly to me, eh? ... What am I saying? Did you not tell me just now that Delphine is in the room? She is more tender-hearted than her sister.... Eugène, you are my son, you know. You will love her; be a father to her! Her sister is very unhappy. And there are their fortunes! Ah, God! I am dying, this anguish is almost more than I can bear! Cut off my head; leave me nothing but my heart."

"Christophe!" shouted Eugène, alarmed by the way in which the old man moaned, and by his cries, "go for M. Bianchon, and send a cab here for me. I am going for your daughters, dear father; I will bring them back to you."

"Make them come! Compel them to come! Call out the Guard, the military, anything and everything, but make them come!" He looked at Eugène, and a last gleam of intelligence shone in his eyes. "Go to the authorities, to the Public Prosecutor, let them bring them here; come they shall!"

"But you have cursed them."

"Who said that!" said the old man in dull amazement. "You know quite well that I love them, I adore them! I shall be quite well again if I can see them.... Go for them, my good neighbor, my dear boy, you are kind-hearted; I wish I could repay you for your kindness, but I have nothing to give you now, save the blessing of a dying man. Ah! if I could only see Delphine, to tell her to pay my debt to you. If the other cannot come, bring Delphine to me at any rate. Tell her that unless she comes, you will not love her any more. She is so fond of you that she will come to me then. Give me something to drink! I am burning up inside. Press something against my forehead! If my daughters would lay their hands there, I think I should get better.... My, God! who will recover their money for them when I am gone?... I will manufacture vermicelli out in Odessa; I will go to Odessa for their sakes."

"Here is something to drink," said Eugène, supporting the dying man on his left arm, while he held a sedative to Goriot's lips.

"How you must love your own father and mother!" said the old man, and grasped the student's hand in both of his. It was a feeble, trembling grasp. "I am going to die; I shall die without seeing my daughters; do you understand? To be always thirsting, and never to drink; that has been my life for the last ten years.... I have no daughters, my sons-in-law killed them. No, since their marriages they have been dead to me. Fathers should petition the Chambers to pass a law against marriage. If you love your daughters, do not let them marry. A son-in-law is a rascal who poisons a girl's mind and contaminates her whole nature. Let us have no more marriages! It robs us of our daughters; we are left alone upon our death-beds, and they are not with us then. They ought to pass a law for dying fathers. This is awful! It cries for vengeance! They cannot come, because my sons-in-law forbid them!... Kill them!... Restaud and the Alsatian, kill them both! They have murdered me between them!... Death or my daughters!... Ah! it is too late, I am dying, and they are not here!... Dying without them!... Nasie! Fifine! Why do you not come to me? Your papa is going—"

"Dear Old Goriot, calm yourself. There, there, lie quietly and rest; don't worry yourself, don't think."

"I shall not see them. Oh! the agony of it!"

"You shall see them."

"Really?" cried the old man, still wandering. "Oh! shall I see them; I shall see them and hear their voices. I shall die happy. Ah! well, after all, I do not wish to live; I cannot stand this much longer; this pain that grows worse and worse. But, oh! to see them, to touch their dresses—ah! nothing but their dresses, that is very little; still, to feel something that belongs to them. Let me touch their hair with my fingers... their hair..."

His head fell back on the pillow, as if a sudden heavy blow had struck him down, but his hands groped feebly over the quilt, as if to find his daughters' hair.

"My blessing on them..." he said, making an effort, "my blessing..."

His voice died away. Just at that moment Bianchon came into the room.

"I met Christophe," he said; "he is gone for your cab."

Then he looked at the patient, and raised the closed eyelids with his fingers. The two students saw how dead and lustreless the eyes beneath had grown.

"He will not get over this, I am sure," said Bianchon. He felt the old man's pulse, and laid a hand over his heart.

"The machinery works still; more is the pity, in his state it would be better for him to die."

"Ah! my word, it would!"

"What is the matter with you? You are as pale as death."

"Dear fellow, the moans and cries that I have just heard.... There is a God! Ah! yes, yes, there is a God, and He has made a better world for us, or this world of ours would be a nightmare. I could have cried like a child; but this is too tragic, and I am sick at heart.

"We want a lot of things, you know; and where is the money to come from?"

Rastignac took out his watch.

"There, be quick and pawn it. I do not want to stop on the way to the Rue du Helder; there is not a moment to lose, I am afraid, and I must wait here till Christophe comes back. I have not a farthing; I shall have to pay the cabman when I get home again."

Rastignac rushed down the stairs, and drove off to the Rue du Helder. The awful scene through which he had just passed quickened his imagination, and he grew fiercely indignant. He reached Mme. de Restaud's house only to be told by the servant that his mistress could see no one.

"But I have brought a message from her father, who is dying," Rastignac told the man.

"The Count has given us the strictest orders, sir—"

"If it is M. de Restaud who has given the orders, tell him that his father-in-law is dying, and that I am here, and must speak with him at once."

The man went.

Eugène waited for a long while. "Perhaps her father is dying at this moment," he thought.

Then the man came back, and Eugène followed him to the little drawing-room. M. de Restaud was standing before the fireless grate, and did not ask his visitor to seat himself.

"Monsieur le Comte," said Rastignac, "M. Goriot, your father-in-law, is lying at the point of death in a squalid hole in the Latin Quarter. He has not a penny to pay for firewood; he is expected to die at any moment, and keeps calling for his daughter—"

"I feel very little affection for M. Goriot, sir, as you probably are aware," the Count answered coolly. "His character has been compromised in connection with Mme. de Restaud; he is the author of the misfortunes that have embittered my life and troubled my peace of mind. It is a matter of perfect indifference to me if he lives or dies. Now you know my feelings with regard to him. Public opinion may blame me, but I care nothing for public opinion. Just now I have other and much more important matters to think about than the things that fools and outsiders may say about me. As for Mme. de Restaud, she cannot leave the house; she is in no condition to do so. And, besides, I shall not allow her to leave it. Tell her father that as soon as she has done her duty by her husband and child she shall go to see him. If she has any love for her father, she can be free to go to him, if she chooses, in a few seconds; it lies entirely with her—"

"Monsieur le Comte, it is no business of mine to criticise your conduct; you can do as you please with your wife, but may I count upon your keeping your word with me? Well, then, promise me to tell her that her father has not twenty-four hours to live; that he looks in vain for her, and has cursed her already as he lies on his death-bed—that is all I ask."

"You can tell her yourself," the Count answered, impressed by the thrill of indignation in Eugène's voice.

The Count led the way to the room where his wife usually sat. She was drowned in tears, and lay crouching in the depths of an armchair, as if she were tired of life and longed to die. It was piteous to see her. Before venturing to look at Rastignac, she glanced at her husband in evident and abject terror that spoke of complete prostration of body and mind; she seemed crushed by a tyranny both mental and physical. The Count jerked his head towards her; she construed this as a permission to speak.

"I heard all that you said, monsieur. Tell my father that if he knew all he would forgive me.... I did not think there was such torture in the world as this; it is more than I can endure, monsieur! But I will not give way as long as I live," she said, turning to her husband. "I am a mother. Tell my father that I have never sinned against him in spite of appearances!" she cried aloud in her despair.

Eugène bowed to the husband and wife; he guessed the meaning of the scene, and that this was a terrible crisis in the Countess' life. M. de Restaud's manner had told him that his errand was a fruitless one; he saw that Anastasie had no longer any liberty of action. He came away bewildered, and hurried to Mme. de Nucingen. Delphine was in bed.

"Poor dear Eugène, I am ill," she said. "I caught cold after the ball, and I am afraid of pneumonia. I am waiting for the doctor to come."

"If you were at death's door," Eugène broke in, "you must be carried somehow to your father. He is calling for you. If you could hear the faintest of those cries, you would not feel ill any longer."

"Eugène, I dare say my father is not quite so ill as you say; but I cannot bear to do anything that you do not approve, so I will do just as you wish. As for him, he would die of grief, I know if I went out to see him and brought on a dangerous illness. Well, I will go as soon as I have seen the doctor. Ah!" she cried out, "you are not wearing your watch, how is that?"

Eugène reddened.

"Eugène, Eugène! if you have sold it already or lost it.... Oh! it would be very wrong of you!"

The student bent over Delphine and said in her ear, "Do you want to know? Very well, then, you shall know. Your father has nothing left to pay for the shroud that they will lay him in this evening. Your watch has been pawned, for I had nothing either."

Delphine sprang out of bed, ran to her desk, and took out her purse. She gave it to Eugène, and rang the bell, crying:

"I will go, I will go at once, Eugène. Leave me, I will dress. Why, I should be an unnatural daughter! Go back; I will be there before you. Thérèse," she called to her maid, "ask M. de Nucingen to come upstairs at once and speak to me."

Eugène was almost happy when he reached the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève; he was so glad to bring the news to the dying man that one of his daughters was coming. He fumbled in Delphine's purse for money, so as to dismiss the cab at once; and discovered that the young, beautiful, and wealthy woman of fashion had only seventy francs in her private purse. He climbed the stairs and found Bianchon supporting Goriot, while the house surgeon from the hospital was applying moxas to the patient's back, under the direction of the physician—it was the last expedient of science, and it was tried in vain.

"Can you feel them?" asked the physician. But Goriot had caught sight of Rastignac, and answered, "They are coming, are they not?"

"There is hope yet," said the surgeon; "he can speak."

"Yes," said Eugène, "Delphine is coming."

"Oh! that is nothing!" said Bianchon; "he has been talking about his daughters all the time. He calls for them as a man impaled calls for water, they say—"

"We may as well give up," said the physician, addressing the surgeon. "Nothing more can be done now; the case is hopeless."

Bianchon and the house surgeon stretched the dying man out again on his loathsome bed.

"But the sheets ought to be changed," added the physician. "Even if there is no hope left, we must respect. I shall come back again, Bianchon," he said, turning to the medical student. "If he complains again, rub some laudanum over the diaphragm."

He went, and the house surgeon went with him.

"Come, Eugène, courage, my boy," said Bianchon, as soon as they were alone; "we must put him into a clean shirt and change his sheets. Go and tell Sylvie to bring some sheets and come and help us to make the bed."

Eugène went downstairs, and found Mme. Vauquer engaged in setting the table; Sylvie was helping her. He had scarcely opened his mouth before the widow walked up to him with the acidulous sweet smile of a cautious shopkeeper who is anxious neither to lose money nor to offend a customer.

"My dear M. Eugène," she said, when he had spoken, "you know quite as well as I do that Old Goriot has not a brass farthing left. If you give out clean linen for a man who is just going to turn up his toes, you are not likely to see your sheets again, for one is sure to be wanted to wrap him in. Now, you owe me a hundred and forty-four francs as it is, add forty francs to that for the pair of sheets, and then there are several little things, besides the candle that Sylvie will give you; altogether, it will all mount up to at least two hundred francs, which is more than a poor widow like me can afford to lose. Lord! now, M. Eugène, look at it fairly. I have lost quite enough in these five days since this run of ill-luck set in for me. I wish to goodness the old gentlemen had moved out as you said. It sets the other lodgers against the house. It would not take much to make me send him to the workhouse. In short, just put yourself in my place. I have to think of my establishment first, for I have my own living to make."

Eugène hurried up to Goriot's room.

"Bianchon," he cried, "the money for the watch?"

"There it is on the table, or the three hundred and sixty odd francs that are left of it. I paid up all we owe out of it. The pawn ticket lies there under the money."

Rastignac hurried downstairs.

"Here, madame" he said in disgust, "let us square accounts. M. Goriot will not stay much longer in your house, nor shall I—"

"Yes, he will go out feet foremost, poor old gentleman," she said, counting the francs with a half-pleased, half-lugubrious expression.

"Let us get this over," said Rastignac.

"Sylvie, get some sheets, and go upstairs to help the gentlemen."

"You won't forget Sylvie," said Mme. Vauquer in Eugène's ear; "she has been sitting up these two nights."

As soon as Eugène's back was turned, the old woman hurried after her servant.

"Take the sheets that have been cut down from number 7. Lord! they are plenty good enough for a corpse," she said in Sylvie's ear.

Eugène, by this time, was part of the way upstairs, and did not overhear the elderly economist.

"Quick," said Bianchon, "let us change his shirt. Hold him up."

Eugène went to the head of the bed and supported the dying man, while Bianchon drew off his shirt; and then Goriot made a movement as if he tried to clutch something to his breast, uttering a low inarticulate moaning the while, like some dumb animal in mortal pain.

"Ah! yes!" cried Bianchon. "It is the little locket and the chain made of hair that he wants; we took it off a while ago when we put the blisters on him. Poor fellow! he must have it again. There it lies on the chimney-piece."

Eugène went to the chimney-piece and found the little plait of faded golden hair—Mme. Goriot's hair, no doubt. He read the name on the little round locket, ANASTASIE on the one side, DELPHINE on the other. It was the symbol of his own heart that the father always wore on his heart. The curls of hair inside the locket were so fine and soft that is was plain they had been taken from two childish heads. When the old man felt the locket once more, his chest heaved with a long deep sigh of satisfaction, like a groan. It was something terrible to see, for it seemed as if the last quiver of the nerves were laid bare to their eyes, the last communication of sense to the mysterious point within whence our sympathies come and whither they go. A delirious joy lighted up the distorted face. The terrific and vivid force of the feeling that had survived the power of thought made such an impression on the students, that the dying man felt their hot tears falling on him, and gave a shrill cry of delight.

"Nasie! Fifine!"

"There is life in him yet," said Bianchon.

"What does he go on living for?" said Sylvie.

"To suffer," answered Rastignac.

Bianchon made a sign to his friend to follow his example, knelt down and pressed his arms under the sick man, and Rastignac on the other side did the same, so that Sylvie, standing in readiness, might draw the sheet from beneath and replace it with the one that she had brought. Those tears, no doubt, had misled Goriot; for he gathered up all his remaining strength in a last effort, stretched out his hands, groped for the students' heads, and as his fingers caught convulsively at their hair, they heard a faint whisper:

"Ah! my angels!"

Two words, two inarticulate murmurs, shaped into words by the soul which fled forth even as he spoke.

"Poor dear!" cried Sylvie, melted by that exclamation; the expression of the great love raised for the last time to a sublime height by that most ghastly and involuntary of lies.

The father's last breath must have been a sigh of joy, and in that sigh his whole life was summed up; he was cheated even at the last. They laid Old Goriot upon his wretched bed with reverent hands. Thenceforward there was no expression on his face, only the painful traces of the struggle between life and death that was going on in the machine; for that kind of cerebral consciousness that distinguishes between pleasure and pain in a human being was extinguished; it was only a question of time—and the mechanism itself would be destroyed.

"He will lie like this for several hours, and die so quietly at last, that we shall not know when he goes; there will be no rattle in the throat. The brain must be completely suffused."

As he spoke there was a footstep on the staircase, and a young woman hastened up, panting for breath.

"She has come too late," said Rastignac.

But it was not Delphine; it was Thérèse, her maid, who stood in the doorway.

"M. Eugène," she said, "Monsieur and Madame have had a terrible scene about some money that Madame (poor thing!) wanted for her father. She fainted, and the doctor came, and she had to be bled, calling out all the while, 'My father is dying; I want to see papa!' It was heartbreaking to hear her—"

"That will do, Thérèse. If she came now, it would be trouble thrown away. M. Goriot cannot recognize any one now."

"Poor, dear gentleman, is he as bad at that?" said Thérèse.

"You don't want me now, I must go and look after my dinner; it is half-past four," remarked Sylvie. The next instant she all but collided with Mme. de Restaud on the landing outside.

There was something awful and appalling in the sudden apparition of the Countess. She saw the bed of death by the dim light of the single candle, and her tears flowed at the sight of her father's passive features, from which the life had almost ebbed. Bianchon with thoughtful tact left the room.

"I could not escape soon enough," she said to Rastignac.

The student bowed sadly in reply. Mme. de Restaud took her father's hand and kissed it.

"Forgive me, father! You used to say that my voice would call you back from the grave; ah! come back for one moment to bless your penitent daughter. Do you hear me? Oh! this is fearful! No one on earth will ever bless me henceforth! every one hates me; no one loves me but you in all the world. My own children will hate me. Take me with you, father; I will love you, I will take care of you. He does not hear me... I am mad..."

She fell on her knees, and gazed wildly at the human wreck before her.

"My cup of misery is full," she said, turning her eyes upon Eugène. "M. de Trailles has fled, leaving enormous debts behind him, and I have found out that he was deceiving me. My husband will never forgive me, and I have left my fortune in his hands. I have lost all my illusions. Alas! I have forsaken the one heart that loved me—she pointed to her father as she spoke—"and for whom? I have held his kindness cheap, and slighted his affection; many and many a time I have given him pain, ungrateful wretch that I am!"

"He knew it," said Rastignac.

Just then Goriot's eyelids unclosed; it was only a muscular contraction, but the Countess' sudden start of reviving hope was no less dreadful than the dying eyes.

"Is it possible that he can hear me?" cried the Countess. "No," she answered herself, and sat down beside the bed. As Mme. de Restaud seemed to wish to sit by her father, Eugène went down to take a little food. The boarders were already assembled.

"Well," remarked the painter, as he joined them, "it seems that there is to be a little death-orama upstairs."

"Charles, I think you might find something less painful to joke about," said Eugène.

"So we may not laugh here?" returned the painter. "What harm does it do? Bianchon said that the old man was quite insensible."

"Well, then," said the employee from the Museum, "he will die as he has lived."

"My father is dead!" shrieked the Countess.

The terrible cry brought Sylvie, Rastignac, and Bianchon; Mme. de Restaud had fainted away. When she recovered they carried her downstairs, and put her into the cab that stood waiting at the door. Eugène sent Thérèse with her, and bade the maid take the Countess to Mme. de Nucingen.

Bianchon came down to them.

"Yes, he is dead," he said.

"Come, sit down to dinner, gentlemen," said Mme. Vauquer, "or the soup will be cold."

The two students sat down together.

"What is the next thing to be done?" Eugène asked of Bianchon.

"I have closed his eyes and composed his limbs," said Bianchon. "When the certificate has been officially registered at the Mayor's office, we will sew him in his shroud and bury him somewhere. What do you think we ought to do?"

"He will not smell at his bread like this any more," said the painter, mimicking the old man's little trick.

"Oh, hang it all!" cried the tutor, "let Old Goriot drop, and let us have something else for a change. He is a standing dish, and we have had him with every sauce this hour or more. It is one of the privileges of the good city of Paris that anybody may be born, or live, or die there without attracting any attention whatsoever. Let us profit by the advantages of civilization. There are fifty or sixty deaths every day; if you have a mind to do it, you can sit down at any time and wail over whole hecatombs of dead in Paris. Old Goriot has died, has he? So much the better for him. If you venerate his memory, keep it to yourselves, and let the rest of us feed in peace."

"Oh, to be sure," said the widow, "it is all the better for him that he is dead. It looks as though he had had trouble enough, poor soul, while he was alive."

And this was all the funeral oration delivered over him who had been for Eugène the type and embodiment of Fatherhood.

The fifteen lodgers began to talk as usual. When Bianchon and Eugène had satisfied their hunger, the rattle of spoons and forks, the boisterous conversation, the expressions on the faces that bespoke various degrees of want of feeling, gluttony, or indifference, everything about them made them shiver with loathing. They went out to find a priest to watch that night with the dead. It was necessary to measure their last pious cares by the scanty sum of money that remained. Before nine o'clock that evening the body was laid out on the bare sacking of the bedstead in the desolate room; a lighted candle stood on either side, and the priest watched at the foot. Rastignac made inquiries of this latter as to the expenses of the funeral, and wrote to the Baron de Nucingen and the Comte de Restaud, entreating both gentlemen to authorize their man of business to defray the charges of laying their father-in-law in the grave. He sent Christophe with the letters; then he went to bed, tired out, and slept.

Next day Bianchon and Rastignac were obliged to take the certificate to the registrar themselves, and by twelve o'clock the formalities were completed. Two hours went by, no word came from the Count nor from the Baron; nobody appeared to act for them, and Rastignac had already been obliged to pay the priest. Sylvie asked ten francs for sewing the old man in his shroud and making him ready for the grave, and Eugène and Bianchon calculated that they had scarcely sufficient to pay for the funeral, if nothing was forthcoming from the dead man's family. So it was the medical student who laid him in a pauper's coffin, despatched from Bianchon's hospital, whence he obtained it at a cheaper rate.

"Let us play those wretches a trick," said he. "Go to the cemetery, buy a grave for five years at Père-Lachaise, and arrange with the Church and the undertaker to have a third-class funeral. If the daughters and their husbands decline to repay you, you can carve this on the headstone—'Here lies M. Goriot, father of the Comtesse de Restaud and the Baronne de Nucingen, interred at the expense of two students.'"

Eugène took part of his friend's advice, but only after he had gone in person first to M. and Mme. de Nucingen, and then to M. and Mme. de Restaud—a fruitless errand. He went no further than the doorstep in either house. The servants had received strict orders to admit no one.

"Monsieur and Madame can see no visitors. They have just lost their father, and are in deep grief over their loss."

Eugène's Parisian experience told him that it was idle to press the point. Something clutched strangely at his heart when he saw that it was impossible to reach Delphine.

"Sell some of your jewels," he wrote hastily in the porter's room, "so that your father may be decently laid in his last resting-place."

He sealed the note, and begged the porter to give it to Thérèse for her mistress; but the man took it to the Baron de Nucingen, who flung the note into the fire. Eugène, having finished his errands, returned to the lodging-house about three o'clock. In spite of himself, the tears came into his eyes. The coffin, in its scanty covering of black cloth, was standing there on the pavement before the gate, on two chairs. A withered sprig of hyssop was soaking in the holy water bowl of silver-plated copper; there was not a soul in the street, not a passer-by had stopped to sprinkle the coffin; there was not even an attempt at a black drapery over the wicket. It was a pauper who lay there; no one made a pretence of mourning for him; he had neither friends nor kindred—there was no one to follow him to the grave.

Bianchon's duties compelled him to be at the hospital, but he had left a few lines for Eugène, telling his friend about the arrangements he had made for the burial service. The house student's note told Rastignac that a mass was beyond their means, that the ordinary office for the dead was cheaper, and must suffice, and that he had sent word to the undertaker by Christophe. Eugène had scarcely finished reading Bianchon's scrawl, when he looked up and saw the little circular gold locket that contained the hair of Goriot's two daughters in Mme. Vauquer's hands.

"How dared you take it?" he asked.

"Good Lord! is that to be buried along with him?" retorted Sylvie. "It is gold."

"Of course it shall!" Eugène answered indignantly; "he shall at any rate take one thing that may represent his daughters into the grave with him."

When the hearse came, Eugène had the coffin carried into the house again, unscrewed the lid, and reverently laid on the old man's breast the token that recalled the days when Delphine and Anastasie were innocent little maidens, before they began "to think for themselves," as he had moaned out in his agony.

Rastignac and Christophe and the two undertaker's men were the only followers of the funeral. The Church of Saint-Étienne du Mont was only a little distance from the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève. When the coffin had been deposited in a low, dark, little chapel, the law student looked round in vain for Goriot's two daughters or their husbands. Christophe was his only fellow-mourner; Christophe, who appeared to think it was his duty to attend the funeral of the man who had put him in the way of such handsome tips. As they waited there in the chapel for the two priests, the chorister, and the beadle, Rastignac grasped Christophe's hand. He could not utter a word just then.

"Yes, M. Eugène," said Christophe, "he was a good and worthy man, who never said one word louder than another; he never did any one any harm, and gave nobody any trouble."

The two priests, the chorister, and the beadle came, and said and did as much as could be expected for seventy francs in an age when religion cannot afford to say prayers for nothing.

The ecclesiatics chanted a psalm, the Libera nos and the De profundis. The whole service lasted about twenty minutes. There was but one mourning coach, which the priest and chorister agreed to share with Eugène and Christophe.

"There is no one else to follow us," remarked the priest, "so we may as well go quickly, and so save time; it is half-past five."

But just as the coffin was put in the hearse, two empty carriages, with the armorial bearings of the Comte de Restaud and the Baron de Nucingen, arrived and followed in the procession to Père-Lachaise. At six o'clock Goriot's coffin was lowered into the grave, his daughters' servants standing round the while. The ecclesiastic recited the short prayer that the students could afford to pay for, and then both priest and lackeys disappeared at once. The two grave-diggers flung in several spadefuls of earth, and then stopped and asked Rastignac for their fee. Eugène felt in vain in his pocket, and was obliged to borrow five francs of Christophe. This thing, so trifling in itself, gave Rastignac a terrible pang of distress. It was growing dusk, the damp twilight fretted his nerves; he gazed down into the grave, and the tears he shed were drawn from him by the sacred emotion, a single-hearted sorrow. When such tears fall on earth, their radiance reaches heaven. And with that tear that fell on Old Goriot's grave, Eugène de Rastignac's youth ended. He folded his arms and gazed at the clouded sky; and Christophe, after a glance at him, turned and went—Rastignac was left alone.

He went a few paces further, to the highest point of the cemetery, and looked out over Paris and the windings of the Seine; the lamps were beginning to shine on either side of the river. His eyes turned almost eagerly to the space between the column of the Place Vendôme and the cupola of the Invalides; there lay the great world that he had longed to penetrate. He glanced over that humming hive, seeming to draw a foretaste of its honey, and said magniloquently:

"We'll fight this out, you and I."

Then, as a first challenge to Society, Rastignac went to dine with Mme. de Nucingen.
